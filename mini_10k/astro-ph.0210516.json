We present a first set of results concerning stellar evolution of rotating low-mass stars.

Furthermore, as shown by Talon & Charbonnel (1998) and Charbonnel & Talon (1999) using models\nwithout \u03bc-currents, we confirm that rotation-induced mixing in stars braked via magnetic torquing can explain\nthe blue side of the Li dip, as well as the low Li abundances observed in subgiants even when \u03bc-currents are taken\ninto account. We emphasize that \u03bc variations are not to be neglected when treating rotation-induced mixing, and\nthat they could be of great importance for latter evolutionary stages.\nKey words. Stars: interiors, rotation, abundances - Hydrodynamics- Turbulence\n\n1. Introduction\nWhereas standard stellar evolution models (allowing solely\nfor mixing in convective regions) represent a good tool\nfor a zeroth order description of stellar observations, they\ncannot account for series of abundance patterns observed\nin various locations of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nWhile some abundance anomalies are best explained\nin terms of surface features (as is the case of Am stars\nfor example; see Turcotte et al. 2000), others probably\ninvolve deep mixing (as the He overabundances in O stars;\nsee Maeder & Meynet 2000 for details). Rotation induced\nmixing, in the form of meridional circulation, baroclinic\nand shear instabilities, in conjunction with microscopic\ndiffusion has been extensively used in order to reduce the\ndiscrepancies between standard models and observations,\nand has proved to be quite promising.\nHowever, following rotation induced mixing in stellar\nevolution codes is challenging and, up to now, many of\nthe theoretical results from numerical computations have\nassumed some hypothesis that could be too restrictive.\nSend offprint requests to: Ana Palacios ; apalacio@ast.obsmip.fr\n\nHere, we wish to further examine the role of horizontal\nchemical inhomogeneities in the evolution of meridional\ncirculation.\nAs first pointed out by Mestel (1953), meridional circulation is generated by a departure from spherical symmetry, and settles to restore it, but in turn generates itself a\nnew dissymmetry: the meridian currents transport material with different mean molecular weights from one place\nto another of the radiative zone, so that a non-spherical\n\u03bc-distribution is set up which retroacts on the circulation,\ndiminishing its magnitude. In this early description, assuming that the radiative zone does not suffer any local\nturbulent mixing and that the star remains in solid body\nrotation, this retroaction was actually shown to inhibit totally the circulation in chemically inhomogeneous regions.\nKippenhahn (1974) pointed out the importance of taking into account the changes in molecular weight, particularly because a strong \u2207\u03bc may represent a barrier that\nhinders mixing. In the models he proposes to explain the\nAm phenomenon, Vauclair (1977) emphasizes also the important role of the \u03bc-barrier and underlines the fact that\nit can considerably delay mixing below the convective envelope of slow rotators. This point, and more precisely the\n\n\f2\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nretroaction effect of the \u03bc-currents on meridional circulation still in the case of Am stars, was rediscussed further\nby Moss (1979).\nThis idea of the chocking of meridional circulation by\nmean molecular gradients was pushed further by Zahn\n(1992). In the formalism he develops the vertical velocity\nof meridional circulation, U , can be written as the sum of\ntwo major terms, one describing the effects of rotation in a\nhomogeneous star, and the other accounting for the effects\nof chemical inhomogeneities on the circulation (see \u00a7 2). In\nthis description, he emphasizes the fact that, due to the\nstrong vertical stratification in stars, horizontal motions\nare much favoured compared to vertical ones and that\nstrongly anisotropic turbulence is likely to set in (such a\ndescription is also used by Tassoul & Tassoul 1982). The\neffect of that turbulence is to mix chemicals horizontally,\nthus slowly destroying the horizontal inhomogeneities that\ngive rise to \u03bc-currents.\nVauclair (1999) uses simplified expressions for rotational mixing and couples them to microscopic diffusion\nin order to examine their combined effect in slowly solidbody rotating stars. After the build-up of the horizontal \u03bc\ngradients that block the \u03a9-currents as in Mestel's description, she describes a self-regulated process which could\nfreeze both meridional circulation and gravitational settling.\nIn the present paper, we present complete treatment\nof rotation induced mixing, including meridional circulation, turbulence by shear instabilities and microscopic diffusion. We will describe the effects of such a combination\nof processes on the transport of both angular momentum\nand chemical species in main sequence and subgiant Pop\nI stars. Concerning the later point, we refer to the papers\nof Talon & Charbonnel (1998) and Charbonnel & Talon\n(1999) (hereafter TC98 and CT99 respectively) who investigated these kind of processes under the scope of the\nso-called lithium dip problem, but did not include the effects of the variations of the mean molecular weight on\nthe mixing.\nWe will only consider stars that, according to observations in open clusters, lie on the hot side of the lithium\ndip. Indeed, as pointed out by TC98, other transport processes for momentum are known to act in lower mass stars.\nIn particular, the rotation induced mixing we implemented\nhere fails to reproduce the solar rotation profile as inferred\nfrom helioseismology (Matias & Zahn, 1997), a conclusion also reached using other versions of detailed rotation\ninduced mixing (Chaboyer, Demarque, & Pinsonneault,\n1995). TC98 suggested that the additional mechanism responsible for momentum transport in the Sun could well\nexplain the rise of Li abundances on the red side of the Li\ndip, and it is the point of view we adopt here by restricting\nour study to the blue side.\nWe intend to apply our description of rotational induced mixing to abundance anomalies in evolved stars\n(red giants) in a forthcoming study and will therefore set\nhere the theoretical stage that we will use in this and in\npapers to come. In \u00a7 2, we give a detailed description of\n\nthe physics at work, recalling the basis of the theory presented in Zahn (1992) and Maeder & Zahn (1998). We will\nthen (\u00a7 3) describe the numerical method as well as the inputs used in the models presented. In \u00a7 4 we compare the\nmodels including mixing to standard evolutionary tracks,\nand analyze in more details the effects of the \u03bc-currents on\nthe transport in \u00a7 5. We will finally compare our results to\nobservations of main sequence and subgiant stars in \u00a7 6,\nbefore giving a summary and conclusions in \u00a7 7.\n\n2. Rotation induced mixing\nMeridional circulation takes place in the radiative interiors of rotating stars where it is generated by the thermal imbalance induced by the departure from spherical\nsymmetry (Eddington 1925, Vogt 1926). Once established,\nthis large scale circulation generates in turn advection of\nmomentum and thus favours the development of strong\nhorizontal diffusion through shear instability, which is the\nmain source of turbulence1 (Zahn 1992, Talon & Zahn\n1997, Maeder & Zahn 1998). On the other hand, vertical turbulence is partly inhibited due to the high level of\nstratification in this direction.\nUnder these conditions of strong anisotropic turbulence, one can use the hypothesis of the so-called \"shellular\nrotation\" (Zahn 1992). In this configuration \u03a9 \u2243 \u03a9(P ) for\ndifferential rotation is weak on isobars.

Dv is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient, taken equal to the turbulent\nviscosity (Zahn 1992). The total diffusion coefficient Dtot\nfor chemicals can be written as the sum of three coefficients:\nDtot = Dmic + Deff + Dv .\n\n(12)\n\n\u039b is tightly related to the horizontal inhomogeneities of\nchemicals, and obeys a similar law as the concentration of\nthe chemicals under the assumption of shellular rotation,\n\u2202\u039b\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n6\n+U\n= \u2212 2 Dh \u039b\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\nr\n\n(13)\n\n(see Chaboyer & Zahn 1992 and Maeder & Zahn 1998 for\ndetails). Even though this equation admits a stationary\nsolution for t \u226b r2 /6Dh , we will follow its time evolution since it allows for greater stability in the numerical\nalgorithms.\nBecause of the low viscosity in stellar interiors, vertical shear due to differential rotation eventually becomes\nturbulent, and we will assume that this instability dominates, noting that baroclinic instabilities may also grow.\nHowever, development of the shear instability is possible\nonly under certain conditions which are fulfilled when the\n\n\f4\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nflow satisfies to both the Reynolds and the Richardson\ninstability criteria.\nThe Richardson criterion compares the stabilizing effect of the entropy gradient to the amount of energy that\ncan be extracted from differential rotation. The instability\ncondition is in general written as\nRi =\n\nN2\n2\n\n(du/dz)\n\n\u2264 Ricrit \u2243\n\n1\n.\n4\n\n(14)\n\nThis criterion is extremely severe and is seldom satisfied\nin stellar interiors.\nHowever, as first pointed out by Townsend (1958),\nthermal diffusivity can decrease the stabilizing effect of\nentropy stratification. Maeder (1995) used this characteristic to show that in actual conditions, there will always\nexist a small enough length scale that will make the fluid\nunstable. The modified Richardson criterion becomes\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0393\n2\n2\n\u0393+1 NT + N\u03bc\nRi =\n\u2264 Ricrit\n(15)\n2\n(du/dz)\nwhere \u0393 = vl/6K, v is the turbulent velocity, l the turbulent length scale, K is the thermal diffusivity, NT2 is\nthe thermal part of the Br\u00fcnt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency and N\u03bc2\nis related to mean molecular weight gradients. \u0393 can be\nviewed as a turbulent Peclet number, the turbulent viscosity \u03bdv = vl replacing the normal microscopic viscosity.\nThe turbulent viscosity is then obtained by setting the\nequality in Eq. (15). Further discussion on these topics\nmay be found in Canuto (1998), who suggests that, in\nsuch a context, the critical Richardson number might actually be closer to unity.\nIn order for the instability to grow, the associated turbulent viscosity must also be larger than the microscopic\nviscosity \u03bd, as expressed by the Reynolds criterion\n\u03bdv \u2264 \u03bdRec\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Rec is the critical Reynolds number (\u2243 10).\nThe estimation of the appropriate formulation for the\nRichardson criterion is critical to give a good estimation\nof the turbulent viscosity, and in turn of the turbulent\ndiffusion coefficient. Meynet & Maeder (2000) present a\ncritical review of the different expressions proposed so far\nconcerning this coefficient. In the present work, we shall\ntake the expression derived by Talon & Zahn (1997) for\nthe vertical component of the turbulent viscosity\nD v = \u03bdv =\n\nRicrit(rd\u03a9/dr)2\n8\n,\n5 NT2 /(K + Dh ) + N\u03bc2 /Dh\n\n(17)\n\nwhich adds to Maeder's prescription by also taking into\naccount the weakening effect of the strong horizontal diffusion on the entropy stratification associated with the\n(vertical) \u03bc gradients. The factor 85 includes, in addition\nto a geometrical factor, the coefficient 25 found by Maeder\n(1995) when deriving the criterion for shear instabilities\nassuming spherical geometry for the turbulent eddies.\nDh is the horizontal diffusion coefficient and is such as\nDh \u226b Dv , thus leading to strong anisotropic turbulence,\n\nwhich is one of the basic hypothesis of the derivation presented. This coefficient appears directly in Eq. (13) describing the evolution of the variations of \u039b, as well as in\nthe vertical and effective diffusivity coefficients. Its evaluation is the weakest point of the theory first developed by\nZahn (1992). In the present paper, we use an expression\nlinking this coefficient to the advection of angular momentum\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 d ln r2 \u03a9\nrU 1 d ln \u03c1r2 U\n.\n(18)\n\u2212\nDh =\nCh 3 d ln r\n2 d ln r\nCh is a free parameter of order unity (see Zahn 1992)\nwhich describes the weakening effect of horizontal turbulence on the vertical transport of chemicals. It appears\nthrough Dh in both effective (Deff ) and turbulent (Dv )\ndiffusion coefficients as can be seen from Eq. (10) and\n(17). As Deff \u221d Ch and Dv \u221d Ch \u22121 , the net effect of varying this parameter on the global diffusion coefficient Dtot\nmight not be very important.\nOn the other hand, the magnitude of turbulent diffusion Dv depends on Ricrit (see Eq. 17). Changing the\nRichardson criterion as previously suggested, by using a\nlarger critical number Ricrit , will result in an enhancement\nof Dv and in turn of the global diffusion coefficient.\n\n3. Numerical simulations : inputs\nWe present and discuss models computed with the\nGrenoble stellar evolution code, STAREVOL.

F\u03a9\nrepresents the torque applied at the surface of the star.\nNote that momentum conservation is equivalent to U = 0\nwhen there is no convective core.\nIn the models presented here, we considered a classical\nperfect gas so that \u03b4 = \u03c6 = 1 in Eqs.

Treatment of the microscopic diffusion\nWe included microscopic diffusion in the form of gravitational settling as well as that related to thermal gradients,\nusing the formulation of Paquette et al. (1986). Atomic\ndiffusion for trace elements Li, Be, B must be addressed\nwith care in the limited range of effective temperature\non the left side of the Li dip. Indeed, Richer & Michaud\n(1993) showed that, for main sequence stars with an effective temperature in the range \u223c 6900 \u2212 7100 K, radiative forces on Li and Be could lead to increased surface\nabundances, at least if large scale mixing is not efficient\nenough to counter balance them. The recent discovery of\na slowly rotating Li rich dwarf (Deliyannis et al. 2002) is\nnicely explained in this framework. This had lead TC98\nand CT99 to remove microscopic diffusion on those elements, in the corresponding temperature range. Here, we\nadopt a different view point. We compute a first series of\nmodels including microscopic diffusion (but not radiative\nforces) on all light elements. Then, for stars in the range\nof effective temperature between \u223c 6900 \u2212 7100 K, we also\ncompute models without microscopic diffusion on Li, Be\nand B. The differences between these two series of models\ngive an indication of the amount of microscopic diffusion\nthat remains in our rotating models. As we shall show,\nthis amount is minute. One must keep in mind though\n\nthat the real effect of microscopic diffusion in these stars\nwill be to slightly enhance Li and Be abundances rather\nthan diminish them.\nLet us note that radiative forces have a magnitude which\nis similar to that of settling (see Richer et al. 2000 Figs.\n5 & 6). Thus, if mixing is efficient enough to (almost) inhibit settling, it will also inhibit levitation by radiation.\nFor main sequence stars with Teff > 7100 K, radiative\nforces do not play a major role compared to atomic diffusion, which is thus the only process (apart from rotationinduced mixing) which is applied.\n\n3.5. Input physics\nA rather detailed description of our stellar evolution code\ncan be found in Siess et al. (1997) (see also Siess et al.\n(2000) for more recent aspects). As far as main sequence\nand subgiant models are concerned, let us briefly summarize here the relevant physics. Our equation of state\nhas been developed from the Pols et al. (1995) formalism. Thermodynamical features of each plasma component (ions, electrons and photons, as well as H\u2212 and H2 )\nare obtained by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy that\nincludes separately non-ideal effects (Coulomb shielding\nand pressure ionisation). In input, instead of the usual\npressure or density variable, it uses a new independent\nvariable that describes the electron degeneracy. This allows in turn to treat analytically the ionisation process and\nprovides very smooth profiles of thermodynamical quantities. It is particularly well suited to treat partially ionised\nand partially degenerated regions, pressure ionisation and\nCoulomb interactions in a stellar evolution code. More details about this equation of state are given in Siess et al.\n(2000).\nRadiative opacities are interpolated from Alexander\n& Fergusson (1994) at temperatures below 8000 K, and\nfrom Iglesias & Rogers (1996) at higher temperatures.\nAtmospheres are integrated in the gray, plan-parallel and\nEddington approximations. Our nuclear reaction network\nallows to follow the abundance evolution of 53 species\n(from 1 H to 37 Cl) through 180 reactions. All nuclear reaction rates have been updated with the NACRE compilation (Angulo et al., 1999). The value of \u03b1p = l/Hp ,\nthe ratio of the mixing length to the pressure scale height,\nis taken equal to 1.75. No overshooting is considered for\nconvection.\n\n4. Global characteristics of the models\nWe present evolutionary results for five different masses\n(1.35, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8 and 2.2 M\u2299 ) at Z = 0.02. Models include\ncomplete treatment of angular momentum and chemicals\ntransport, taking into account the effects of changes of \u03bc\n(E\u03bc 6= 0) and applying microscopic diffusion to all elements.\nThese models sample the effective temperature domain\ncovered by the observations of main-sequence stars on\nthe hot side of the lithium dip in young open clusters\n\n\fPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

They also span the mass range of\nPop I subgiants to which our results will be compared in\na further section (\u00a7 6).\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the evolutionary tracks of our rotating models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (solid\nlines), comparing them to their standard analogs (dashed\nlines).\nTable 2 presents some characteristics of the computed\nmodels with and without rotation. All models were computed with the same set of parameters for rotation induced\nmixing (Ch = 1 and Ricrit = 0.25), but with different rotational histories (see \u00a7 3.2).\nOne can see clearly how mixing affects main-sequence\nevolution. In rotating models, the turn-off is moved towards cooler temperatures while the luminosity is slightly\nenhanced. Due to surface effects, still cooler effective temperatures (by up to \u223c 100 K in the fastest stars considered\nhere) would be obtained if the effects of rotation on structure equations were taken into account (Per\u00e9z Hern\u00e1ndez\net al. 1999). Let us note that the actual value depends on\nthe inclinaison angle of the star.\nOur models are computed without convective core\novershooting. We checked however that for the 1.8M\u2299\nmodel, the effect of mixing on main sequence lifetime and\non the turnoff in the HRD is equivalent to an overshooting distance for convection of about 0.1HP (where HP is\nthe pressure scale height at the edge of the classical core).\nThis value is smaller than the one (0.2) typically used to fit\nthe observed color-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate age galactic open clusters (Meynet et al. 1993,\nLebreton 2000 and references therein) . Whether the rotating models would fit the cluster isochrones remains to\nbe checked. This requires a more extended grid of masses\nand is out of the scope of the present paper.\nOn the subgiant branch, stars evolve at higher luminosities. This is due to the effect of microscopic diffusion\nduring the main sequence phase. Indeed, even if it is partly\nbalanced by the action of large scale mixing, microscopic\n\nFig. 1. HR diagrams for the five masses considered in this\npaper. Dashed lines are for standard models and solid lines\nare for models with the \"complete mixing\" and Ch = 1.\nMasses are as indicated on the plot. Z = 0.02 for all models\npresented.\n\ndiffusion leads to the build up of a negative helium gradient at the base of the convective envelope. When the first\ndredge-up begins, the envelope encounters regions with\na lower opacity (due to enhancement of helium) leading\nto enhanced luminosities compared to standard models.\nWhen reaching the RGB, differences in effective temperature and luminosity between standard and rotating models\nbecome marginal: both tracks are almost identical in the\nHR diagram (see Fig. 1).\nModels with rotational mixing behave as if their metallicity was lower than in the standard cases. This trend was\nalready emphasized by CT99.\nOn the other hand, the lifetimes of rotating models\nare enhanced with respect to those of standard models.\nIn fact, due to the positive slope of the hydrogen profile,\nmixing slightly feeds the core with fresh hydrogen fuel.\nThe exhaustion of hydrogen in the central region is delayed\nand the time spent on main sequence increases.\nIn the mass range we are studying here, the less massive the star, the more turn-off ages differ between rotating and non-rotating models2 . This trend with mass has to\nbe related to braking, which is more important for lower\nmass stars as imposed by both theory and observations.\nStronger mixing corresponds to a more efficient extraction\nof angular momentum at the surface, thus leading to enhanced meridional circulation and mixing. There should\n2\n\nThe time spent on the main sequence is increased by more\nthan 20% in the lower mass stars, and by \u2248 10% in the higher\nmass models.\n\n\f8\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nthus be a correlation between mixing and braking, as we\nwill show from the comparison of our models with observations (see \u00a7 6).\n\n5. Effects of \u2207\u03bc and \u03bc-currents\nTo discuss the effects of chemical composition variations\non transport, we will focus on the 1.5 M\u2299 model. We\npresent a comparative study of the results obtained with\nand without \u03bc-currents (E\u03bc = 0 or E\u03bc 6= 0. In both cases\nall parameters are kept identical in order to make the comparison clearer. Furthermore, we applied a torque so that\nsurface velocity at the age of the Hyades (\u2243 700 Myrs) is\nthe same whether E\u03bc is zero or not.\n\n5.1. Meridional circulation velocity U (r)\nFigure 2 presents profiles of U , \u03a9 and the diffusion coefficient Dtot at different times on the main sequence, indicated in terms of central hydrogen mass fraction Xc .\nWe superimpose the profiles obtained for E\u03bc = 0 (dashed\nlines) and E\u03bc 6= 0 (solid lines).\nWhen neglecting \u03bc-currents (E\u03bc = 0), the meridional\nvelocity is negative in the entire mixing zone. There is only\none meridian loop that brings matter upwards at the equator and down in polar regions. This leads to the extraction\nof angular momentum in the radiative zone, a consequence\nof braking. The amplitude of meridional velocity decreases\nas the star evolves and braking slows down.\nWhen E\u03bc is not zero, some changes appear. There are\nnow two loops of circulation. In the outer parts of the\nradiative zone, the negative loop keeps on transporting\nmaterial from the equator up along the pole, in response\nto the extraction of angular momentum. In the interior\nhowever, circulation is positive, revealing an inward transport of angular momentum. Equations (3), (5) and (7)\nalready suggest a strong interaction between \u03a9- and \u03bccurrents. Apart from the first term in Eq. (3), which includes Eddington-Sweet and Gratton-\u00d6pik terms, E\u03a9 and\nE\u03bc are almost mirrored. At the beginning of the evolution, |E\u03a9 | > |E\u03bc |, for \u03bc-currents have not settled yet. As\nthe star evolves and \u03bc-gradients built-up, \u03bc-currents may\ngrow. |E\u03bc | and |E\u03a9 | eventually become of the same order\nof magnitude, and U disminishes.\nContrary to what was expected by Mestel (1953) the\ncirculation is not frozen. Indeed, the two terms E\u03bc and\nE\u03a9 , while being of the same order, never compensate each\nother as can be seen in Fig. 3, where U becomes very\nsmall, but never disappears completely. Indeed, due to\nthe strength of the horizontal diffusion, the circulation\nmust remain to continuously refresh the horizontal \u03bc fluctuation. However, the difference between both contributions E\u03a9 and E\u03bc decreases significantly as the star evolves.\nMeridional circulation velocity is thus quite slow near the\nend of the main sequence, but transport of chemicals still\noccurs, as can be seen from the diffusion coefficient in\nFig. 2.\n\n5.2. Rotation profile \u03a9\nThe inner transport of angular momentum also affects the\nrotation profiles (Fig. 2 middle panels): when including \u03bccurrents, differential rotation grows larger. In particular,\nthe core gains momentum and gets accelerated as evolution proceeds instead of keeping a nearly constant rotation\nrate. This can be of crucial importance when further following the evolution of the star on the red giant branch.\nThis behaviour may be interpreted as follows: the rate of\ndifferential rotation and the relative variations of mean\nmolecular weight are related to each other via the equation of state (Eq. 5). Observations and theory show us that\nthe circulation in main sequence stars on the hot side of\nthe Li dip must act to extract angular momentum. In this\nconfiguration, the term E\u03a9 creates an anti-clockwise circulation transporting matter from the pole down to the\nequator. E\u03bc , on the otherside, opposing E\u03a9 (see Eq. 3),\ngenerates a clockwise circulation. The net effect is a reduction of angular momentum transfer to the surface and\nan enhancement of differential rotation.\nIn Fig. 4 we present profiles of \u0398 and \u039b at given evolutionary points. The bold line represents the \u0398 profile in\nthe absence of \u03bc-currents. The difference between both is\nstriking. It shows, as was already pointed out by Talon et\nal. (1997) in their study of a 9 M\u2299 star, that the description of the rotation profile and of the circulation is not\nanymore a matter of \u0398 (or \u03a9) alone, but of \u0398 \u2212 \u039b. Indeed,\n\u0398 is then conditioned by \u039b due again to their mirrored\nevolution (Eqs. 5 and 7).\nThe large central differential rotation is a key ingredient in core evolution. Indeed, \u03bc-gradients in that region\ninhibit the development of a large turbulent diffusivity\n(see Eq. 13). However, the large shear resulting from the\nmirror evolution of \u0398 and \u039b significantly increases local\ncore mixing3 .\nLet us mention the work of Th\u00e9ado & Vauclair (2001),\nwho performed calculations including the effects of \u03bccurrents according to Vauclair (1999) in order to reproduce the low dispersion found in the \"Spite lithium\nplateau\". Assuming slow, constant, solid body rotation (a\nfew km.s\u22121 in typical halo dwarfs), and that the transport\nof chemicals is progressively blocked when E\u03bc = E\u03a9 (a situation they call creeping paralysis), they achieve a dispersion of 0.1 dex in the lithium plateau, in agreement with\nobservations. We point out the fact that their scenario\nimplies solid body rotation and thus prevents the rotation\nprofile to react to horizontal molecular weight gradients as\nis the case in our description. Solid body rotation would\nbe enforced in the presence of a small magnetic field or\nby gravity waves (Talon & Charbonnel, in preparation),\n3\n\nAs explained in Talon et al. 1997, in a non-evolving model,\nEq. (2) has a stationnary solution in which advection of momentum by the circulation is compensated by turbulent transport. There is thus a \u0398 equilibrium profile. When adding \u03bccurrents, about the same equilibrium exists for \u0398 \u2212 \u039b. This\nleads to \u0398 following the behavior of \u039b, resulting in large differential rotation in the core.\n\n\fPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\n9\n\nFig. 2. Profiles of the vertical component of the meridional velocity Ur (left panels), angular velocity \u03a9 (middle panels)\nand diffusion coefficients (right panels) inside a 1.5 M\u2299 , Z = 0.02 star. Solid lines are for the model with E\u03bc 6= 0 and\ndashed lines for the model with E\u03bc = 0. Central hydrogen content is as indicated. In the left panels, bold parts in the\nsolid lines indicate positive values of Ur .\nwhich might be the case in halo stars as well as in the\nstars lying on the cool side of the Li dip. However, as discussed by TC98, such an additional process of extraction\nof angular momentum is not expected to be efficient in\nthe more massive stars lying on the left side of the Li dip\nwhich are under the scope of this study.\n\n5.3. Diffusion coefficients\nThe examination of the total diffusion coefficients (from\nFig. 2), reveals that, except towards the centre, they appear to be very much the same, whether E\u03bc is zero or\nnot. The transport of chemicals, contrary to that of angular momentum, will thus not be significantly affected during main sequence evolution (see next section). However,\nwhile the total coefficients are of similar amplitude, they\nare not the result of the same combination of effects. Fig. 5\npresents various diffusion coefficients in both cases for a\ncentral hydrogen content Xc = 0.2. We can firstly emphasize the fact that the shellular rotation is actually realistic,\n\nfor Dh \u226b Deff and Dv . Secondly, when E\u03bc 6= 0, the turbulent diffusion coefficient Dv is larger than the effective\ncoefficient Deff almost everywhere in the radiative zone.\nThis is a consequence of the enhancement of the differential rotation rate in this case, which favours the growth\nof turbulence4 . Due to the strong anisotropy of turbulent\nmotions, the buoyancy restoring forces in the vertical direction are slightly reduced because of the horizontal diffusion, and vertical turbulent mixing is allowed. The profile\nof the effective diffusion coefficient is influenced by U (r)\n(Eq. 10), so that it reflects the loops of the circulation in\nthe presence of \u03bc-currents, each \"drop\" corresponding to\nan inversion of the direction of the flow.\nWhen neglecting variations of \u03bc, turbulence can only\nmarginally develop in a small portion of the radiative\nzone and the vertical diffusion coefficient Dv is reduced\nto molecular viscosity which is always smaller than Deff .\n4\n\nThis appears clearly when turning to Eq. (17), through\nwhich Dv \u221d (d\u03a9/dr)2 .\n\n\f10\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nFig. 3. Vertical component of the meridional circulation velocity, U as a function of the reduced radius at the same\nepochs inside the same star.\n(left panel), where we see Deff dropping down below 101\njust above the core. Dv also decreases in the same region, where contrary to the rest of the radiative zone, it is\ndominated by the molecular viscosity rather than by the\nturbulent viscosity (there is no turbulence).\n\nFig. 4. Profiles of \u0398 and \u039b inside the 1.5 M\u2299 star for three\ndifferent values of the central hydrogen content. Solid lines\nare for \u0398, dashed ones for \u039b. Thin lines stand for models\nwhere \"complete mixing\" (E\u03bc 6= 0) is applied while the\nbold line gives the profile of \u0398 when E\u03bc = 0.\nIn the central part, we may notice that the total diffusion coefficient is lowered by one order of magnitude\nin the presence of \u03bc-currents. As pointed out before, \u03bcgradients in that region inhibit the development of an efficient turbulent diffusivity. This appears clearly in Fig. 5\n\nFigure 6 presents a comparison between the evolution\nof the lithium surface abundance in the 1.5M\u2299 rotating\nstar when considering or not the effects of \u03bc-currents. Both\ntracks are similar, but the depletion of lithium during the\nmain sequence is larger in case of E\u03bc = 0. The surface\nabundance of lithium differs by more than 0.3 dex at 700\nMyrs, which is more than the observational errorbar commonly assumed. Accounting for \u03bc variations reduces the\neffect of mixing when all others assumptions remain the\nsame. We have seen that \u03bc-currents rule the evolution of\nthe rotation profile. They lead to an enhancement of the\ndegree of differential rotation, which in turn allows for the\nhorizontal turbulence to develop more easily. This horizontal turbulence hinders the transport towards the vertical direction. This effect shows up through the surface\nabundance of lithium, that is less depleted when E\u03bc 6= 0.\nNevertheless, this abundance feature can not be advocated\nas an observational clue to the action of the \u03bc-currents.\nIndeed, braking plays a major role in determining the amplitude of mixing (and thus the amplitude of lithium depletion), and thus may rub off the effects of the variations\nof \u03bc. The surface velocity reached for Teff \u2243 4900 K is of\n\n\fPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\n11\n\nFig. 5. Profiles of the different components of the diffusion\ncoefficient and of the thermal diffusivity as a function of\nthe reduced radius when E\u03bc 6= 0 (left) and E\u03bc = 0 (right).\nThe models correspond to the 1.5M\u2299 star with Xc = 0.2.\n\nFig. 6. Evolution of the surface abundance of lithium with\ntemperature in the 1.5 M\u2299 star for the two different approaches of mixing as mentioned on the plot and in the\ntext.\n\na few km.s\u22121 in both cases, velocity for the model with\nE\u03bc = 0 being slightly larger (9 km.s\u22121 versus 6.5 km.s\u22121\nwhen E\u03bc 6= 0), because of the different braking constant\nused in this case in order to achieve the same surface velocity at 700 Myrs as in absence of \u03bc-currents. Both velocities reached at the end of the computation are consistent\nwith observations (Gaig\u00e9 1993). As a result, accounting\nfor the effects of \u03bc-currents under the assumptions described in \u00a7 3 does not make any significant change in\nthe outcoming surface abundances compared to the case\nwithout variations of \u03bc. The observed abundances used as\nconstraints do not allow to distinguish between these two\ncases. However we pointed out differences in the final rotation profiles, which might change significantly rotational\ntransport during later evolutionary phases.\n\nstars. We refer to TC98 and CT99 for a detailed discussion of the different processes which have been proposed to\naccount for this feature. These papers show how rotation\ninduced mixing shapes in a very natural way the hot side\nof the Li dip. As already mentioned, we did not consider\nthe effects of the \u03bc gradients in these previous papers.\nHowever, as discussed in \u00a7 4.2.3, the total diffusion coefficients, and thus the resulting transport of chemicals, is not\nsignificantly affected by these terms during main sequence.\nAs a consequence, the comparison of the predictions of Li\nand Be surface abundances with observations on the hot\nside of the Li dip remains highly satisfactory, as can be\nseen in Figs. 7 and 8.\nIn CT99, microscopic diffusion on LiBeB had been\nturned off (while it was applied to all other chemicals) for\nstars with Teff higher than 6900 K, because of the competition between radiative acceleration and gravity (Richer &\nMichaud 1993, Richer et al. 2000, see discussion \u00a7 3.4). In\nFigs. 7 and 8, we present the results of computations with\nand without gravitational settling of LiBeB at the effective\ntemperature where radiative forces can over-compensate\ngravitation. As can be seen, for the rotationnal velocities\nconsidered here, the differences are minute. In addition,\nthe effect on stellar structure itself is null, since LiBeB\nare trace elements.\nObservations of C, N and O are precious clues on transport mechanisms inside main-sequence F-type stars, and\non the competition between atomic diffusion and macroscopic processes. Indeed, in the case of pure atomic diffusion, these elements are expected to be underabundant in\nthe Li dip, as shown in Fig. 9. On the other hand, in our\n\n6. Comparison with observations\nWe now compare the predictions of our rotating-models\nwith the observations of Li, Be and CNO on the hot side\nof the so-called Li dip at the age of the Hyades, and of Li\nin subgiants of solar metallicity.\n\n6.1. Li, Be and CNO on the hot side of the Li dip in\nthe open clusters\nThe drop-off in the Li content of main-sequence F stars\nin a narrow range of effective temperature centred around\n6700 K, or \"Li dip\" (Wallerstein et al. 1965, Boesgaard\n& Tripicco 1986, Balachandran 1995), is the most striking\nsignature of transport processes that occur inside these\n\n\f12\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nFig. 7. Comparison of the models (hexagons and open\nbold star) with observations in the Hyades (crosses),\nin Praesepe (squares) and in Coma Berenices (circles\nand triangles). Downward triangles are for upper limits.\nObservations are from Burkhart & Coupry (1998,2000)\nand Boesgaard (1987). The corresponding masses of the\nmodels are as indicated on the figure. All models presented\nhave Z = 0.02 and an initial velocity of 110 km.s\u22121 ; the\nreader is referred to Tab. 2 for details on braking. For the\n1.5 M\u2299 model, open bold star is obtained when not including microscopic diffusion on LiBeB while for hexagons\nmicroscopic diffusion was included also for these light elements (see text for further details).\n\nmodels rotation induced mixing strongly inhibits the settling effects. As a result, the surface abundances of CNO\ndo not vary in the Teff range considered. This is in perfect agreement with observations in the Hyades (Varenne\n& Monier 1998, Takeda 1998; see also Boesgaard 1989,\nFriel & Boesgaard 1990, Garcia Lopez et al. 1993), as can\nbe seen in Fig. 9. Let us stress that in the temperature\ndomain of A-type stars, most of the observations report\nabundances for chemically peculiar objects, namely Am\nstars, that are slow rotators in which the action of gravitational settling is important on CNO elements. These peculiar patterns might be achieved by considering the combined effects of large scale circulation, turbulence, gravitational settling and radiative forces (the effects of the latter\nnot being included in our evolutionary code) in models\nwith a slow initial rotation. Such computations are not\npresented here for this is out of the scope of the present\nstudy to focus on such a particular phenomenon.\n\nFig. 8.

The\nempty triangle is a 1.5 M\u2299 model where microscopic diffusion is not applied to LiBeB. Refer to Tab. 1 for further\ndetails on braking.\n\n6.2. Li in subgiants\nEarly observations by Alschuler (1975) of a few field stars\ncrossing for the first time the Hertzsprung gap indicated\nthat lithium depletion starts earlier than predicted by\nstandard dilution for stars more massive than 2 M\u2299 . Later\non, significant lithium depletion was observed in a non\nnegligible number of slightly evolved field stars (Brown et\nal. 1989, Balachandran 1990). do Nascimento et al. (2000)\nstudied the behaviour of lithium in a sample of field subgiants observed by L\u00e8bre et al. (1999) for which Hipparcos\ndata allowed the precise determination of both evolutionary status and mass. They confirmed that stars originating\nfrom the hot side of the dip present a large range of lithium\nabundances which can not be explained by standard dilution alone and which reflect different degrees of depletion\nof this element while on the main sequence, even if its signature does not appear at the stellar surface at the age\nof the Hyades (see Vauclair 1991, Charbonnel & Vauclair\n1992). In this cluster, dilution is not sufficient to explain\nlithium values in evolved stars (which have masses of the\norder of 2.2 M\u2299 ), while main sequence stars present galactic abundance (Boesgaard et al. 1977, Duncan et al. 1998).\nThis has been observed also in open clusters with turnoff\nmasses higher than \u223c 1.6 M\u2299 (Gilroy 1989, Pasquini et\nal. 2001).\nIn Fig. 10 we compare our predictions for the surface\nLi abundance of various models with the observations in\n\n\fPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\nFig. 9. Abundances of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen vs effective temperature in the Hyades, presented as asterisks\nand open stars for A and Am stars respectively (the latter ones are not meant to be reproduced here; see text\nfor details).

(1998) (see Varenne & Monier 1999 for further details).\nboth field and open cluster evolved stars. First note that in\nclassical models without rotation the variation in surface\nLi abundance is very similar for stars of different masses\nbecause it is only due to the first dredge-up dilution. More\nimportantly, classical Li depletion starts at a too low Teff\n(around \u223c 5850 K) and leads to final Li abundances too\nhigh when compared to observational data. On the other\nhand, and even if no important lithium depletion is expected at the surface of the main sequence stars on the hot\nside of the dip at the age of the Hyades, more lithium destruction occurs inside rotating models compared to classical ones. Indeed, due to the enlargement of the Li free\nradiative regions, important surface Li depletion occurs at\nmuch higher Teff than in classical models.

Conclusions\nTo study the evolution of low mass rotating stars and the\neffects of rotation induced mixing on surface abundance\npatterns, we have presented here a first series of results\nconcerning main sequence and subgiant Pop I stars located on the hot side of the lithium dip. We performed\ncalculations including the treatment of transport of angular momentum and chemical species due to meridional\ncirculation, shear turbulence and gravitational settling according to Maeder & Zahn (1998) formalism. In particular, we take into account horizontal variations of mean\nmolecular weight, and their action on the transport itself.\nThese terms prove to be very important in defining the\nshape of the internal rotation profile. Indeed the horizon-\n\n\f14\n\nPalacios et al.: Rotational mixing in Pop I low-mass stars\n\ntal variations of \u03bc and the derivative of \u03a9, namely, \u039b and\n\u0398 respectively, have a mirrored behaviour, \u0398 following \u039b\nwhen it is not null. As soon as the circulation is settled, the\n\u03bc-currents grow larger and induce a stronger differential\nrotation.\nOn the other hand, the effects of these terms on the\nsurface abundances of light elements appear not to be constraining compared with braking for instance. The major\nchange introduced in the transport of chemicals when taking \u03bc-currents into account concerns the dominant contributor to the diffusion coefficient. In an \"homogeneous\"\nstar (where there are no horizontal variations of \u03bc), the\neffective diffusion coefficient Deff is the major contributor, while in the inhomogeneous case, turbulent diffusion\ncoefficient dominates the transport of chemicals.\nFinally, contrary to what has been suggested in previous work concerning rotation induced mixing in solid body\nrotating low mass stars (typically halo main sequence stars\nwith M\u22c6 < 0.9M\u2299 ), when considering extraction of angular momentum through magnetic braking, the situation of\n\"creeping paralysis\" of the circulation is not reached in the\nmodels presented here. It shall actually never be the case\nas long as differential rotation is allowed to exist for the\nmirrored terms never compensate each other.\nThe point to be emphasized is the fact that these variations of mean molecular weight are not to be neglected\nwhen considering rotating objects. They modify the action\nof mixing and can be of major importance after main sequence evolution, for they constrain the internal rotation\nprofile.\nAcknowledgements.
