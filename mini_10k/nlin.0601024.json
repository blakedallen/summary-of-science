Prime number sequence is found in many\nunrelated areas. Examples range from the periodic orbits of a system in quantum chaos to the life cycles of species\n[1-3].\nOn the other hand, some new methods in chaos and statistic theory are also applied to study the primes.\nNormally, the differences of primes are used. The famous 3 period oscillation was found in statistics histogram of\ndifference of consecutive primes many years ago[4]. It also happens in the histogram of increment (difference of\ndifference) of consecutive prime [5][6]. The difference of primes in Dirichlet classification appears the same\nspecial periodic behavior [7]. Paper [8] shows its relation with the celebrated Sierpinski fractal. The interesting\n\"Jump Champion\" problem also belongs to this kind research [9].\nGoldbach conjecture is a theme about the sum of primes. It states that every even integer > 2 can be expressed\nas the sum of two primes. The proof remains an unsolved problem since Goldbach first wrote the conjecture in a\nletter to Euler in 1792. However, significant progress has been made in recent years.\nIn 1855, Desboves verified Goldbach Conjecture for n < 10000. The recent record is n < 2 \u00d7 10\n\n17\n\n[10] .No\n\ncounter-example has been found to date. Till now, the best theory result is J. R. Chen's 1966 theorem that every\nsufficiently large integer is the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes [11]. Some new methods in\nother area are also applied to study this conjecture. For example, paper [12] gives it a novel discussion by small\nworld network theory.\nThis paper is mainly concerned with the statistic character of Goldbach partition. Goldbach partition r(n) is the\nnumber of representations of an even number n as the sum of two primes. For example:\n\n100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53\nSo r(100)=6.Here '3+97' and '97+3' are regarded as the same representation.\nWe find the interesting fractal character in the detailed structure of series r(n). The subtle symmetry also\n*\n\nCorresponding author: guoypm@hust.edu.cn\n\n\fappears when comparing the r(n) with the statistics of difference of two prime numbers. In the second section of\nthis paper, we just introduce these experimental results. Then a theory discussion is given in the third section.\nHere we build the relation between a simple unimodal mappings and r(n) by symbolic dynamics theory. A\nreferenced Lyapunov exponent of series r(n) is also obtained through this relation. Conclusions are summarized in\nthe last section.\n\n2 Experimental results\n2.1 Three period oscillations\nHere r(n) is defined as the Goldbach partition, n is even number. We could calculate the Goldbach partition of\nconsecutive even numbers and plot it in a figure (Fig 1).\n\nFig 1. Figure of series r ( n),6 < n < 2 \u00d7 10\n\n4\n\nThis figure is sometimes called the \"Goldbach Comet\". It appears in paper [13] first. Here Henry Fliegel of\nAerospace Corporation, and Douglas Robertson of National Geodesic Survey in 1989 computed r(n) for\n\nn < 1\u00d7 10 5 and plotted it. What they found was that the graph had two distinct bands and a sharp lower edge,\nresembling the appearance of a comet. It shows that generally the number of distinct representations increases\nwith increasing n. An asymptotic approach appears to provide a possible avenue for success in proving out the\nGoldbach Conjecture. Hardy and Littlewood had derived an estimate for r(n) in 1923 [14]:\n\nr ( 2n) ~\n\n2nC\n(log n) 2\n\nHere, C =\n\n\u220f\n\np > 2 , p| n\n\np \u22121\np\u22122\n\n1\n\n\u220f (1 \u2212 ( p \u2212 1)\np>2\n\n2\n\n) = 0.66016 LL\n\nWhile Goldbach comet supports the Goldbach conjecture, it of course does not prove anything. It is opinions of\n\n\fmany researchers. So there are still no many researches for it. Some recent work for its lower/upper bounds could\nbe found in [15][16].For us, the obvious band structure in the figure is more attractive. The figure is clearly\ndivided into upper part and lower part, which have some similarities. Some well-regulated subtle structure also\nappears in these two parts. Maybe there is something linking the fractal and chaos. This is our interests.\nJust like the research about the statistics of difference of consecutive prime number (Fig 2.a), we could also\nselect some segments of r(n) and plot them in the form of histogram(Fig 2.b, c ).\n\nFig 2. (a) Statistics histogram of differences for the first 10 million of consecutive prime numbers. (b)\nHistogram of Goldbach partitions r(n), 50<n<114.(c) Histogram of r(n), a segment of n>15000.(d) r(n) in\ndifferent colors\nWe find the 3 period oscillations in histogram of difference of consecutive primes also appear in the histogram\nof r(n). This phenomenon could be described as:\n\nr (6k ) > r (6k + 2)\nr (6k ) > r (6k + 4)\n\n, k is natural number, k >25\n\nTo see it more clearly, we plot the figure of r (n), n = 6k ,6k + 2,6k + 4 in different color (Fig 2.d). We\n\n\ffound series r(6k) is clearly bigger than others. r(6k+2) and r(6k+4) are almost mixed together, but the low bound\nis\nr(6k+2)\nmostly.\nThe\ndetailed\nnumerical\ncalculating\nof\n\nr (6k ) \u2212 r (6k + 2), r (6k ) \u2212 r (6k + 4),150 < 6k < 5 \u00d7 10 4 also proves it. So we guess this character may be\nscale invariant. The oscillation of statistics of difference of consecutive primes still can't be explained strictly, so\ndoes this sum of primes.\nHere is a probability explanation for this band structure of series r(n). Consider\n\n6k \u2261 0 \u2261 1 + 5(mod 6),6k + 2 \u2261 2 \u2261 1 + 1(mod 6),6k + 4 \u2261 4 \u2261 5 + 5(mod 6)\nSo even numbers in 6k can take from all the primes in 6k+1 and 6k+5, but even numbers in 6k+2, 6k+4 can only\ntake primes from 6k+1 or 6k+5 exclusively. So generally their Goldbach partitions\n\nr (6k ) > r (6k + 2), r (6k ) > r (6k + 4) . The multiplier\n\n\u220f\n\np > 2 , p| n\n\np \u22121\nin the estimate of Hardy-Littlewood\np\u22122\n\ncould also give a rough explanation. Here we can't deduce r (6k ) > r (6k + 2), r (6k ) > r (6k + 4) by\nHardy-Littlewood conjecture because we didn't know the detailed distribution of primes. But these plausible\nexplains seem very precise.\nTo make a comparison, we also plot the estimate of Hardy-Littlewood in the form of dot figure and histogram\n(Fig 3.a, b).Here we denote: h( 2n) =\n\n2nC\n(log n) 2\n\n\u220f\n\np > 2 , p| n\n\np \u22121\n.we find the h(n) has the same periodic character as\np\u22122\n\nr(n).\n\nFig 3 (a) histogram of h(n), (b) dot figure of h(n)\nThe histogram only contains a small segments of r(n) and describes the detailed structure. The dot figure of r(n)\ndepicts the general structure of r(n) .So this finding could be described as:\nObservation 1:\nHistogram form: The r(n) is a 3 period oscillations series.\nDot figure form: Figure of r(n) has three parts, a upper parts and two lower parts mixed together. We could\n\n\falso say figure of r(n) is divided into 2 independent parts.\n2 .2 Fractal\nTo make the description more clear, We rewritten series r(n) as follows:\n\nr1 = r (6), r2 = r (8), r3 = r (10),LL, rn = r (2 \u00d7 n + 4)\nThen we disjoint the r(n) into three new series, which are marked as A1 , A2 , A3 respectively.\n\nr : r1 , r2 , r3 ,L , rn\nA1 : r1 , r4 , r7 ,L r3i\nA1 : r2 , r5 , r8 , L r3i +1\nA1 : r3 , r6 , r9 ,L r3i + 2 , i = 1,2,3,4,5L\nIt expresses the coloring method in paragraph 2.1. We call it \"series disjoint method\" with interval 3, which\nselect element in the same place of every period and construct 3 new series. In fact, it's a common method in\nsome chaos time series analyzing technologies like C-C method.\nTo study their detailed structure, we could also plot the A1 , A2 , A3 in histogram form. A random segment is\nselected from series A1 , A3 (Fig 4).\n\nFig 4. Histogram of A1 , A3\n\nInteresting thing appears. We found these series all have 5 period oscillation with few exceptions We verify this\ncharacter before n < 5 \u00d7 10 . In A1 , there is 69 exception , accounting for 4%. Exception in A2 is 6%, A3 is\n4\n\n8%. The exceptions in the series are equably distributed. This oscillation is very precise.\nHere we could also divide A1 into 5 new series B1 , B2 , B3 , B4 , B5 by \"series disjoint method\". The maximal\nseries is plotted by red color, other four by blue. A2 is also divided into 5 new series and plot in the same\n\n\fmethod (Fig 5.a). The figure of A1 , A2 all have a clear upper part and a lower part. We could found there is some\nblue dots in the maximal sub-series of A1 . It's just the exception periods. The Fig 5.b shows the maximal\nsub-series of A1 and exception points alone.\n\nFig 5. (a) Figure of series A1 , A2 (b) Exception dot in A1 .\n\nWe found in A1:\n\nr (6 \u00d7 5k ) > r (6 \u00d7 (5k + i ))\ni = 1,2,3,4\n\n, k is natural number.\n\nIn A2:\n\nr (6 \u00d7 (5k + 3) + 2) > r (6 \u00d7 (5k + i ) + 2)\ni = 0,1,2,4\n\n, k is natural number.\n\nIn A3:\n\nr (6 \u00d7 (5k + 1) + 4) > r (6 \u00d7 (5k + i ) + 4)\ni = 0,2,3,4\n\n, k is natural number.\n\nWe also divide the h(n) into three new series and plot them in two forms(Fig 6). Few exception periods also\nexist in h(n).\n\n\fFig.6 Histogram and figure of h(n)\nWe have:\nObservation 2:\nHistogram form: The r(n) is a 3*5=15 period oscillations series, which is embedded with 3 period oscillations.\nDot figure form: Figure of r(n) has three parts, a upper parts and two lower parts mixed together. Every of these\nthree parts also comprises 5 parts, an upper parts and four lower parts mixed together. We could also say\nFigure of r(n) is divided into 4 'independent' parts.\n\nWe go ahead. If looking into the detailed structure of new series B1 divided from A1, we find it is oscillation\nseries with period 7. Other four series also have 7 period oscillations. We plot one of them in the form of\nhistogram (Fig 7).\n\nFig 7. Histogram of B1\nThen we divide B1 into 7 new series by \"series disjoint method\". We find there is also a maximal sub series in\n\nB1 . The others are mixed together. The exception periods accounts 1% in this figure. This phenomenon also\n\n\fhappens in A2 , A3 . The exception in other series also doesn't exceed 10%.\nWe plot the maximal sub-series by red color and other series of B1 by blue. Because B1 is the maximal sub\nseries of A1 . So we select one lower sub-series of A1 and divide it into 7 new series. Its maximal sub series is\nalso plotted by green color and other 6 series by pink. We also do the same thing for A2 and plot it in the same\nmap (Fig.8.a). h(n) is also plotted in the same way (Fig.8.b).\n\nFig 8. (a). Figure of A1 , A2 .(b). Figure of h(n)\n\nTill now, we have:\nObservation 3:\nHistogram form: The r(n) is a 3*5*7=105 period oscillations series embedded with 3*5=15 period oscillations.\nThese 15 period oscillations are also embedded with 3 period oscillations.\nDot figure form: Figure of r(n) has three parts, a upper parts and two lower parts mixed together. Every of these\nthree parts comprises of 5 parts, an upper parts and four lower parts mixed together. Every of these 5 parts also\nhas 7 parts, an upper part and six lower parts mixed together. We could also say Figure of r(n) is divided\ninto 8 'independent' parts.\nJust as we wish, all 7 piece of sub-series divided from B1 is 11 periodic series. 13 periods are also found in\nthe more detailed structure. So we guess all prime number periods will appear if getting enough data of r(n). In\nfact, if we want to find the 23 period oscillation, the series r(n) should be divided into\n\n3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 19 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10 6 piece of new series. We may also need at least 200 data in one series.\nSo all the Goldbach partition of n, n < 2 \u00d7 10\n\n9\n\nshould be calculated. It's a difficult mission for personal\n\ncomputer, but maybe a good research topic for Grid Computing.\nWe stop here and conclude the operation above as follows:\n(1) By \"series disjoint method\", r(n) could be divide into 3 piece of new independent series , which are all 5\n\n\fperiods.\n(2) Each of these 3 series could also be divided into 5 new independent series. These 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 series are all 7\nperiods.\n(3) Every of these 15 new series is divided into 7 new independent series. These 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 105 series all\nhave 11 periods.\nIf combining these three steps together, we could say that the r(n) is divided into 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 = 105 new series\nby \"series disjoint method\" and all these series will have 11 periods. Continuing this operation, we guess bigger\nprime number period will appear in the more detailed structure of r(n). We summarize this operation in a precise\nform and get conjecture:\nConjecture 1:\nLet Pm = 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 L \u00d7 p m =\n\nm\n\n\u220fp\n\ni\n\ni =2\n\n, pi is the ith prime number, m = 2,3,4, L\n\nThe series r (n), n \u2192 \u221e could be divided into Pm pieces of new independent series by \"series disjoint\nmethod\". These new series all have the similar p m +1 period oscillations with few exceptions.\nm \u22121\n\nThis also means the figure of r(n) could be divided into 2\n'independent' parts. So there is no a thinnest\nbands acting as the lower/upper bounds of r(n) figure because we could always find the thinner bands. Under this\nmeaning, there are no exact expressions for the bounding curves of figure r(n). It's just like that famous question\n\"How long is coast of Britain\"[17]. Moreover, if we map a small segment of r(n) to a vertical line of x axis, this\nsection of r(n) will be very similar with the 3 division Cantor Set. So an interesting guess is:\n\"Goldbach Comet\"=\"Britain coast\" + \"Cantor set\". We will discuss the bounds and sections of r(n) in\nanother paper.\nIf regarding r(n) as a time series, we could say r(n) is Pm period oscillations series embed with\n\nPm \u22121 , Pm \u2212 2 , L, P2 period oscillations. Similar periodic behavior also happens in some actual communication\nsignals. It's said that just such signals give Mandelbrot inspiration to create the concept of fractal. This kind of\nsignal is also the standard research object of a new technology \"Wavelets Analysis\".\nWe mark the series A1 , A2 , A3 as the first level series, and B1 , L , B5 , L as the second level series, etc. The\nfigures of the series in different levels all have an upper parts and lower part. A maximal sub-series is clearly\nbigger than others and the others sub-series are mixed together. .All these series also have the similar asymptotic\nfunction. So we could say series r(n) has self-similarity character. Part of this phenomenon could be described as:\nConjecture 2:\nLet Pn = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 L \u00d7 p n =\n\nn\n\n\u220fp\ni =1\n\ni\n\n, pi is the ith prime number, n = 1,2,3, L, \u221e\n\nThen:\n\nr ( Pn \u00d7 k ) > r ( Pn \u00d7 k + i ), i = 2,4,6,L , Pn \u2212 2 , k is natural number. Few exceptions are distributed in\nthe whole series.\nThere are self-similarity and infinite hierarchies in \"Goldbach Comet\". So our finding could be described in one\n\n\fword that the \"Goldbach Comet\" is a typical fractal figure.\n2.3 Symmetry between sum and difference of primes\nWe find 3 period oscillation in histogram of difference of consecutive primes also appears in r(n). Is there any\nrelation between the sum and difference of prime number? The histogram of difference only contain the difference\nof consecutive primes, but the r(n) is the sum of any two primes. To make a clear comparison, we could also\ncalculate the difference of two any primes before a number M.\nHere we define:\n\nDM = {d | d = pi \u2212 p j , i \u2260 j , pi , j \u2208 primes, pi , j < M };\nDM (n) =|| d | d = n, d \u2208 DM ||\nDM (n) is the number of representations of an even number n as the difference of two primes before M. Here\nwe select M=20000. The figure of series DM ( n) and\n\nr(n) are plotted together (Fig 9).\n\nFig 9. (a) Series r(n). (b) Series D(n)\n\nWe find D(n) is almost the mirror figure of r(n). The same fractal feature also appears in the statistics of\ndifference of primes. 3 period oscillations in the histograms of difference of consecutive primes may be the special\nexample of this phenomenon. If defining '3+97' and '97+3' as different representations:\n\n\u23a72r (n), n \u2209 primes\nR (n) = \u23a8\n\u23a92r (n) \u2212 1, n \u2208 primes\nWe get another conjecture:\nConjecture 3:\nWhen n \u2192 \u221e , the figure of series R(n) and D(n) will be precise symmetry.\nIt has no surprise because the conjecture of Hardy-Littlewood for D(n) and R(n) are similar expression. We\n\n\fbelieve this symmetry will play an important role in solving some open problems in number theory. For example,\nif we admit the increases of r(n) and this symmetry, the Twin Primes conjecture will be true. This hypothesis states\nthat there are infinite pairs of consecutive primes with difference of 2.\nThis is a little bit confusing to understand that h(n) has the precisely same detailed structure as r(n) . We guess\nHardy-Littlewood may know these phenomena clearly, but there was no computer to buy in 1923. Here we just\ngive a clearer depiction and a fashionable name \"fractal\" for them. .Now there is only few research papers for the\nfractal in primes system. Most of them could be found in web site [18]. Wish this simple and obvious fractal could\nspark some new ideas in this area.\n\n3 Theory analyzing\nSeveral current researches are mainly for the lower bounds of r(n). Here we are concerned with the periodic\nbehavior of r(n).The distribution of the prime numbers among the integers seems somewhat random. So the\ncombination of two prime sequences may be more complex. But from the viewpoint of chaos and fractal, the most\ncomplex phenomena are always produced by simple law. Here we just give a simple description for the dynamical\ncharacter of r(n) but makes no attempt at explaining it.\nSeries r(n) is composed by different period series. If we only care its periodic character and don't consider their\nvalue, this period embedding and compositing operation could be easily described by the \"*\" product in symbolic\ndynamics theory. Using this theory, we could also connect series r(n) with some one dimension unimodal\nmappings.\nHere we give a brief introduction for \"Applied symbolic dynamics\"[19]. Symbolic dynamic is a profound pure\nmath theory, but its application in chaos analyzing, \"Applied symbolic dynamics\" has developed into a simple and\npowerful tools for researchers in nonlinear science. Symbolic dynamics is a coarse-grained description of\ndynamics by taking into account the \"geometry\". It could be easily explained by one-dimensional unimodal\nmappings x n +1 = f (u , x n ) (Fig 10).\n\nFig 10. Symbol sequence in one dimension unimodal mapping\nIn Fig6, point 'c' in x axis corresponds to the maximal values of function f (u , x) . It divides the x axis into\nleft part and right part. Through the iterated function x n +1 = f (u , x n ) we could get an orbit from an initial point\n\nx0 : x0 , x1 = f ( x0 ), x 2 = f ( x1 ),LL, x n = f ( x n \u22121 ) LL\n\n\fIf we only care the relative place of xi : the point on the left of 'c' is marked as 'L' and the right is 'R. So\n\n\u23a7 L, x i < c\n\u23aa\nthis orbit could be described by a symbolic sequence like ' LLLRRRC L ' , here, xi = \u23a8C , xi = c .\n\u23aa R, x > c\ni\n\u23a9\nNormally,\n\nwe\n\nuse\n\nbasic\n\nsequence\n\nto\n\nrepresent\n\nthe\n\nwhole\n\nperiod\n\nsequence,\n\nfor\n\nexample\n\nRL \u2194 RLRLRL LL\nOur discussion mainly refers to three rules of symbolic dynamics:\n(1) Kneading symbolic sequence. Any orbit can be described by a symbolic sequence, but some symbolic\nsequences couldn't correspond to an actual orbit. MSS table describe the basic 'admissible' sequence. Such\nsequence is also called kneading symbolic sequence, which describe the orbits beginning from the maximal value\npoint of mapping.\n(2) \"*\" product. It defines a composition rules that generate more admissible sequences from known ones,\nwhich is called DGP rule.\nHere is a limited length sequence P and sequence Q = q1 q 2 L\n\nP \u2217 Q = ( P \u2217 q1 )( P \u2217 q 2 ) L ,\n\u23a7( PC ) + , qi = R;\n\u23aa\nP \u2217 qi = \u23a8 PC , qi = C ;\n\u23aa( PC ) , q = L.\n\u2212\ni\n\u23a9\n( PC ) + = max{PR, PL}, ( PC ) \u2212 = min{PR, PL} .\n(3) The relation between symbolic sequence and parameter in a mapping. For a special mapping x n +1 = f (u , x n ) ,\nwe could get a parameter u from one kneading symbolic sequence. That means we could get the actual orbit from\na kneading sequence.\nTo describe the period oscillations of r(n), we select some primes number length of kneading symbolic\nsequences:\n\nM 3 = RLC ;\nM 5 = RLLLC ;\nM\n\nM pi = RL L C ;\n\npi is ith prime number.\nFor example, M 3 describes the 3 period oscillations. M 3 \u2217 M 5 is 3*5=15 period. It describes the period\noscillations which is 3 periods in coarse-grained description, and these three parts are all comprise of 5 period\noscillations. Obviously, the periodic oscillations behavior of series r ( n), n \u2192 \u221e could be described by the\nsymbolic sequence:\n\nM r = M 3 \u2217 M 5 \u2217 M 7 \u2217 L \u2217 M pi \u2217 L , pi is ith prime number.\n\n\fBecause all the M pi are kneading sequence, their '*' composition is also kneading sequence. In theory, there\nmust be an actual orbit in a certain mapping x n +1 = f (u , x n ) corresponding to this sequence. This orbit will\nhave same periodic behavior as r(n). Through symbol sequence, we could build the relation between r(n) and\nsome simple one dimension mappings.\nHere we select: f ( x, u ) = 1 \u2212 ux , x \u2208 [ \u22121,1], u \u2208 (0,2] . According to rule (3), we could get a parameter u\n2\n\ncorresponding to M r .We build a 3 period series first. For M 3 = RLC , we could get its corresponding\nparameter u ( M 3 ) \u2248 1.754877666 . The orbit of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 1.754877666 x n , x0 = 1 is shown in (Fig 11.a).\n2\n\nThen\n\nfor\n\nM 3 \u2217 M 5 = RLC \u2217 RLLLC = RLLRLRRLRRLRRLC\n\n,\n\nWe\n\ncould\n\nget\n\nu ( M 3 \u2217 M 5 ) \u2248 1.79002267 . The orbit of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 1.79002267 x n2 , x0 = 1 is shown in Fig 11.b. A\nsegment of r(n) is also shown in Fig 11 c,d.( Fig 11.d separates the two lower parts)\n\nFig 11. (a) The orbit of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 1.754877666 x n , x0 = 1 . (b) x n +1 = 1 \u2212 1.79002267 x n , x 0 = 1 .(c),(d) a\n2\n\n2\n\n\fsegment of r(n)\nJust as we supposed, Fig 8.a is 3 period and Fig 8.b has three parts and every part is 5 period oscillations.\nBecause M 3 \u2217 M 5 \u2217 M 7 is a 105 length symbolic sequence, the calculation of u ( M 3 \u2217 M 5 \u2217 M 7 ) will\nbecome very difficult for precision limitation. Here we just want to show the complex dynamic character of\nseries r(n) could be presented by a simple iterated function.\n\nu ( M r ) could be estimated as follows:\nHere we select M 5 = RLLLC\n\nM 3 \u2217 M 5 = RLLRLRRLRRLRRLC ;\nBecause the first two symbols of kneading sequence are ' RL ', so:\n\nM 3 \u2217 M 5 \u2217 M 7 = RLLRLRRLRR\n..LRRLC\u2217 RLLC\n= (RLLRLRRLRR\n..LRRLR)(RLLRLRRLRR\n..LRRLL)LC\nAccording to the * composition rule, the M r must have the form:\n\nM r = ( RLLRLRRLRRLRRLR )( RLLRLRRLRRLRRLL) LC = \u2211 LL LC ;\n\nhere, \u2211 =( RLLRLRRLRRLRRLR ) RLLRLRRLRRLRR.\nSo:\n\n\u2211 RC < M < \u2211 LC;\nu (\u2211 RC ) < u ( M ) < u (\u2211 LC ).\nr\n\nr\n\nWe could get:\n\nu (\u2211 RC ) = 1.7900227173230200961029368045274;\nu (\u2211 LC ) = 1.7900240852603652719210458599264;\n1.7900227 < u ( M r ) < 1.7900241.\nIn theory, x n +1 = 1 \u2212 u ( M r ) x n could describe the periodic character of series r(n). Here we can't prove they\n2\n\nare topology conjugated, but the a referenced Lyapunov exponent of r(n) could be obtained through this\nconnection. The Lyapunov exponent of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 ux n ,1.7900227 < u < 1.7900241 is shown in Fig 12.\n2\n\n\fFig 12. Lyapunov exponent of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 ux n ,1.7900227 < u < 1.7900241\n2\n\nSo under this meaning, Lyapunov exponent of series\n\nr (n), n \u2192 \u221e : L(r ) \u2208 ( 0.1983, 0.2119) . There are\n\ntwo other expressions for M 5 , we could also estimated the related u and Lyapunov exponent:\nFor M 5 = RLLRC , 1.7877578 < u < 1.7879103 , L(r ) \u2208 ( 0.1163, 0.1850) .\nFor M 5 = RLRRC , 1.7836878 < u < 1.7844579 , L(r ) \u2208 ( 0.0562, 0.1590)\nIn these three zones of u, we could find some orbits of x n +1 = 1 \u2212 ux n that have the same periodic oscillation\n2\n\nbehavior as series r(n). Because they all have the positive Lyapunov exponent, we could say the r(n) is a chaos\nseries. In fact, because the value zone of series r(n) is not constant , it's also very difficulty to estimate the real\nLyapunov exponent by chaos time series analyzing technology.\nGoldbach Conjecture connects a multiplicative property-being prime-to addition. Such connections are\npoorly understood today. If we regard the primes as prime number period oscillations, the multiplicative property\nand addition property of primes could be connected by '*' product in symbolic dynamics. It may provide a\npossible method for success in cracking the Goldbach Conjecture. Renormalization group theory is another\npowerful tool to study the fractal and chaos. But to analyze this fractal, we may need the deep knowledge in\nnumber theory and physics. Some useful links about this cross-research could be found in web site [20].\n\n4 Conclusions\nJust like many of these researches, we could only give some interesting experimental results and a rough\nexplanation. Prime numbers appear to us as a random collection of numbers without any structure, but their sum\nor difference turns into the well-regulated fractal. Here we cite a word of Y. Motohashi[21] to describe the\nsituation of Riemann Hypothesis and many other open problems in number theory, \"it will be settled without any\n\n\ffundamental changes in our mathematical thoughts, namely, all tools are ready to attack it but just a penetrating\nidea is missing.\" Could this \"Goldbach Comet\" knock a hole in the door of prime treasure house?\n\nReference\n[1] E.
