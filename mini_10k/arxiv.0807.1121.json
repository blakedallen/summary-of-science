LHC as a photon collider\nThe \u03b3\u03b3 exclusive production of pairs of charged\nparticles offers interesting potential for signals of\nnew physics at the LHC. In a recent paper [1],\nthe initial comprehensive studies of high energy\nphoton interactions at the LHC were reported. In\nthe present contribution, the selected results on\nthe gauge boson pairs discussed in Ref. [1] are\nintroduced and supplemented by new results.\nThe exclusive two-photon production, pp \u2192\npXp, provides clean experimental conditions,\nthanks to absence of the proton remnants. Well\ndefined final states can be then selected, and precisely reconstructed. Moreover, detection of the\ntwo final state protons, scattered at almost zerodegree angle, in the dedicated very forward detectors (VFDs), provides another striking signature, effective also at high luminosity and with\nlarge event pile-up [2,3]. In addition, the photon\nenergies can be then measured and used for the\nevent kinematics reconstruction. Finally, virtualities of the exchanged photons are on average\nvery small, and are limited from above due to the\n\u2217 Email:\n\nA set of VFDs at 220 m or 420 m from the\nLHC interaction points will be capable of tagging\nphoton interactions within the wide photon energy range of 20 GeV < E\u03b3 < 900 GeV [5,6]. In\nFig. 1 also the \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity spectrum is shown\nassuming double tagging (i.e. requesting both\nforward protons to be detected).

The luminosity spectrum assuming the\nphoton tagging range 20 GeV < E\u03b3 < 900 GeV\nis also shown (dashed line).\n\nthat apart from such elastic two-photon processes\nwhere both protons have survived the interaction,\nthe inelastic production can also be considered,\nwhen at least one of the two protons dissociates\ninto a low mass state. The corresponding twophoton luminosity increases then by about a factor of three [2]. By integrating the luminosity\nspectrum above some minimal center-of-mass energy W0 , one can introduce the relative photonphoton luminosity L\u03b3\u03b3 , shown in Fig. 2. Effectively, L\u03b3\u03b3 gives a fraction of the proton-proton\nluminosity which is available for \u03b3\u03b3 collisions,\nand is especially useful if a given photon-photon\ncross-section is approximately constant as a function of W\u03b3\u03b3 . For example, the relative photonphoton luminosity at the LHC is equal to 1%\nfor W0 = 23 GeV (i.e. for W\u03b3\u03b3 > 23 GeV),\nand 0.1% for W0 = 225 GeV. Given the very\nlarge LHC luminosity, this leads to significant\nevent rates of high-energy processes with relatively small photon-photon cross sections.

The resulting suppression of the\ncross sections weakly depends on the invariant\nmass of the exclusively produced state X, and\nfor the processes discussed in the following, as\npp \u2192 pW W p, it is estimated to be about 15%\n[7]. This correction is ignored in the present analysis. In addition, one should stress that potentially dangerous background due to the exclusive diffractive production is heavily suppressed\nfor non strongly-interacting particles and can be\nsafely neglected. For example, the gluon mediated exclusive production of W boson pairs, is\nabout 100 times smaller than the two-photon production at the LHC [8].\nAnomalous quartic couplings of the electroweak gauge bosons could directly reveal the\nexchange of new heavy bosons [9,10], and the\n\nLHC\n\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\n\fAnomalous quartic gauge couplings in \u03b3\u03b3 interactions at the LHC\ntwo-photon exclusive production of WW and ZZ\npairs is particularly well suited for studies of the\nquartic couplings \u03b3\u03b3W W and \u03b3\u03b3ZZ. In the\nStandard Model (SM), the cross section of the\nexclusive two-photon production pp \u2192 pW W p is\nlarge about 108 fb\u22121 [1]. This means that unique,\nhigh statistics tests of the gauge boson sector in\nthe SM can be performed at the LHC. In contrast,\nthe cross section of the exclusive two-photon production pp \u2192 pZZp is very small in the SM, since\nthis proccess is not allowed at the tree level. It\nmeans that an observation of even a few events of\nthis type could signal the new physics.\n2.

For example, one\ncan introduce new terms in such a lagrangian,\nwhich are allowed by the local U(1)Y \u00d7 SU(2)L\ngauge invariance, and then consider two scenarios, with [11] and without [12] the Higgs boson.\nIn the present analysis, the phenomenological\nlagrangians are used, which allow for genuine\nanomalous quartic vector boson couplings, without need for associated trilinear gauge couplings.\nFirst, the simplest lagrangian term of power six\nin energy for two photon interaction with weak\nbosons has to conserve local U(1)em and custodial SU(2)c . Then, by imposing conservation of\ndiscrete C and P symmetries one finally obtains\ntwo new terms [9,13]:\nL06 = \u2212\n\n3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere e is the electron charge and \u039b is the energy scale of the new physics. When the global\nSU(2)c symmetry is not imposed then one can\ndistinguish the neutral and charged couplings of\nthe W and Z bosons. Since this more general\nmodel has been assumed for studies at LEP [14],\nto allow for a direct comparison of sensitivities,\n\nwhich corresponds, for a fixed cross section \u03c3, to\nan ellipse on the a0 , ac plane.\n3. Estimation of sensitivity\nSimulation of the exclusive two-photon pair\nproduction at the LHC was performed using the\nmodified MadGraph/MadEvent [16] and CalcHep\n[17] packages. The generated events were then\npassed to the modified Pythia generator [18] to\nallow for decays and hadronisation. The sensitivity to the anomalous quartic vector boson\ncouplings at the LHC has been investigated using the signature of two opposite charge leptons (e or \u03bc) within the generic lepton acceptance window \u2013 |\u03b7| < 2.5 and pT > 10 GeV. In\nthe W W case it corresponds to the subprocesses\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 while in the ZZ case to\nthe subprocesses \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 ZZ \u2192 l+ l\u2212 jj. It is assumed that both processes are background free.\nUnder this condition, the upper limits of number\nof events \u03bbup at the 95% confidence level (CL)\nwere calculated assuming the number of observed\nsm L\nevents equal to the SM prediction Nobs = \u03c3acc\nfor a given integrated luminosity L.\nN\nobs\nX\nk=0\n\nPPoisson (\u03bbup = \u03c3 up L; k) = 1 \u2212 CL\n\n(4)\n\nThis is a simplified approach and for more precise\nanalysis one should use formula from [15], however the difference in the obtained limits is small,\nless than 20%.\n\n\f4\n\nT.

In consequence,\nfor the center-of-mass energies W\u03b3\u03b3 \u226b 2MW the\nscattering amplitude will grow and eventually will\nviolate the unitarity condition. It is therefore necessary to investigate the impact of the unitarity\nconstraint on the derived limits.

Other W W states with different total angular momentum do not violate the\nunitarity earlier, and a1 is close to 0 when a2 is\nmuch smaller than a0 .\nThe unitarity violation occurs due to the increasing contribution of longitudinally polarized\nW bosons, which in the SM is fully compensated\nthanks to the local SU(2)L symmetry and the trilinear gauge couplings. As a consequence, one\nhas to verify if the limits quoted in Tab. 2 are not\ndriven by \u03b3\u03b3 interactions at W\u03b3\u03b3 above 2 TeV.\nAs one can see in Fig. 7, this is actually the case,\nsince the anomalous cross-section is large for the\nenergies well above 2 TeV. This can be avoided in\ntwo ways. The double tagging using very forward\ndetectors would limit the maximal \u03b3\u03b3 center-ofmass energy to 1.8 TeV [6]. One should note that\nthe tagging efficiency in this energy range is high,\nabout 80% [19]. In other case, one can introduce\ndipole form-factors for each anomalous coupling,\nas in Eq. 7. The form-factors suppress the anoma-\n\nwhere u is the cosine of the W boson polar angle\nin the \u03b3\u03b3 center-of-mass system, and M is the\namplitude of the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 . Then,\nthe unitarity bound condition has a form:\nX\n\u221a\nW 2\n2\n(6)\n\u03b2\n|aJ ( s, aW\n0 , aC )| \u2264 (1/2)\npol\n\np\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 4m2W /s is the Lorentz velocity\nof a W boson in the cms frame and pol stands for\npolarization states in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 .\nUnitarity bounds of Eq. 6 for J=0 as a function of W\u03b3\u03b3 are shown for both neutral, in Fig. 5,\nand charged, in Fig. 6, AQGCs together with the\nobtained limits of anomalous couplings for the integrated luminosity L = 10 fb\u22121 . It shows that\nfor these limits the unitarity will be violated when\nW\u03b3\u03b3 is above 2 TeV, also if one allows for a contribution of some other channels, by requesting the\n\n\f6\n\nT.

Expected limits for anomalous quartic\ngauge couplings\nThe sensitivity analysis has been repeated for\nthe process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 using the above formfactors. In Fig. 8 and in Fig. 9 the new sensitivity\nlimits for the integrated luminosity L = 10 fb\u22121\nare shown.\nThe limits were calculated for 5 different \u039b values and linearly interpolated. Moreover, the unitarity limit (solid line in Figs. 8,9) is calculated\nat W\u03b3\u03b3 = \u039b, after correcting for the form-factor\nsuppression. This choice can be explained in the\nfollowing way. If one obtains a limit of an anomalous coupling for W\u03b3\u03b3 = \u039b than for the energies\nbelow \u039b the unitarity is automatically preserved.\nFor higher energies, bigger than \u039b the form-factor\n\nFigure 7.

Summary and perspectives\nThe initial analysis of sensitivity to genuine\nAQGCs in photon-photon collisions at the LHC\nhas been presented.

The 95% CL limits of the W neutral\nanomalous quartic coupling (dashed line) calculated for the integrated luminosity L = 10 fb\u22121\nwith the dipole form-factor. The unitarity curve\n(solid line) is calculated for W\u03b3\u03b3 = \u039b, and due to\ninclusion of the from-factor is four times higher\nthan in Fig. 5. The solid arrows indicate the\nstrongest limit without violating the unitarity,\nand the corresponding energy scale \u039b of the new\nphysics. Dashed arrow recalls the limit obtained\nwithout the form-factors.\n\nby a factor of about 4 000, for the integrated luminosity 10 fb\u22121 . The effects of the form-factors,\nintroduced to preserve unitarity constraints, are\ntaken into account. In addition, the analysis\ndemonstrates the sensitivity to the new physics\nenergy scale up to 2 TeV.\nThere are still several possible ways to improve\nthe sensitivity. First, one can include also semileptonic channels in \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W W , which will increase statistics about 6 times.\nIn addition, one can increase sensitivity by\nstuding the differential distributions, like the lepton pseudo-rapidity (see Fig. 10), or the lepton\nacoplanarity \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 \u2212 M in(2\u03c0 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6, \u2206\u03c6) (see\nFig. 11) distributions. Finally, assuming the custodial SU(2)c symmetry, one can convert the limZ\nits of aW\n0 and a0 into the single a0 limit, and\n\n\u039b [GeV]\n\nFigure 9.
