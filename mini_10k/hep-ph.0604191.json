In particular, the parameters sin2 2\u03b813 ,\n\u03b4CP , and the neutrino mass hierarchy are very interesting, since we know very little about\nthem except from an upper bound on sin2 2\u03b813 [1]. However, even if sin2 2\u03b813 is large, measuring leptonic CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy with long-baseline and reactor\nexperiments will be extremely challenging on that time scale because of the low statistics\n(see, e.g., Ref. [2]). Therefore, any complementary information could help to improve the\nmeasurement. In this study, we discuss the potential complementarity of three sources\nof information: Neutrino beams, reactor experiments, and a possible flavor composition\nmeasurement of an astrophysical neutrino flux.\nConsidered sources\nNeutrino beams, such as MINOS [3], T2K [4], or NO\u03bdA [5], are sensitive to sin2 2\u03b813 , \u03b4CP ,\nand the neutrino mass hierarchy via electron neutrino appearance. However, this ability to\naccess all of the parameters leads to correlations and degeneracies [6\u20139] when it comes to the\nextraction of the individual parameters. In addition, the next generation of \"narrow-band\nbeams\" operated at the oscillation maximum will be mainly sensitive to the CP-odd part\nof the appearance probability. Reactor experiments [10], such as Double Chooz [11], will\nbe very complementary to provide \"clean\" information on sin2 2\u03b813 only [12, 13]. However,\nthese experiments cannot access \u03b4CP and the mass hierarchy at all, and the statistics of the\nfirst generation of experiments will be moderate.\nAs another potential source of information, a detection of astrophysical neutrinos at neutrino\ntelescopes [14\u201317] with a well-predicted flavor composition at the source (such as from\nneutron or pion decays) could provide additional knowledge on the mixing parameters [18\u2013\n20]. The existence of such astrophysical neutrinos is not yet proven, but the detection of very\nhigh energy cosmic rays suggests that cosmic accelerators exist which should also produce\nhigh energy neutrinos, such as by pion decays. There are many potential candidates for\nneutrino sources, such as gamma ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or starburst galaxies,\nwhere the latter source is not affected by the Waxmann-Bahcall bound [21]. Since we are\nnot interesting in the type of source, but the initial flavor composition in this study, we\nwill follow a more abstract approach and classify potential sources by their initial flavor\ncomposition below. If the distance to the source is long enough or the production region\nis large enough, neutrino oscillations on the way from the source to the Earth will average\nout. The predicted flavor composition at the Earth then depends on the mixing parameters\nincluding \u03b4CP and the CP-even part of the mixing only (see, e.g., Ref. [22]), whereas it is\nnot sensitive to the mass hierarchy. However, compared to the terrestrial neutrino sources,\nthere will be no spectral information, which means that, given the low statistics, it will be\ndifficult to extract some information on the individual mixing angles.\nFor the astrophysical sources, we consider neutrino production from neutron decays with\nthe flavor ratio (1:0:0) at the source [23, 24] (\"Neutron beam source\"), from pion decays\nwith the flavor ratio (1:2:0) at the source (\"Pion beam source\"), and from muon damped\n1\n\n\fpion decays with a flavor ratio (0:1:0) at the source [25, 26] (\"Muon damped source\"). In\nthe last case, the muons are absorbed before they can decay, which may also occur for pion\nbeams at high energies [26]. The neutrino fluxes expected from these sources typically scale\nas dN/dE \u221d E \u22122 , where the typical upper neutrino energies can be very different.1 For\nexample, for gamma ray bursts, the typical neutrino energies depend very much on the\nproduction region (and process) and can be between GeV and EeV. For a neutron beam\nproduced by photo-dissociation of heavy nuclei, the typical energies are more limited to the\nTeV range. The sources can be either steady (such as for a neutron beam produced by photodissociation of heavy nuclei, a pion beam from active galactic nuclei, or a diffuse background\nflux), or time-dependent on a short timescale (such as for a flux from a gamma ray burst).\nDepending on neutrino energies and steadiness of the source, the background especially from\natmospheric neutrinos can be problematic for the event extraction especially below about\n1 PeV. For more discussion on background discrimination approaches, see Appendix A.\nObservables and statistics for astrophysical neutrinos\nAs far as the detection of the astrophysical neutrinos is concerned, we do not distinguish\nbetween neutrinos and antineutrinos, i.e., the neutrino and antineutrino fluxes are simply\nadded. A neutrino telescope can identify muons by their tracks (Cherenkov light with continuous loss of energy). However, electron and tau neutrino events are harder to disentangle\nbecause they both produce showers of particles with a larger threshold. Depending on the\nneutrino energy, the electromagnetic showers (from electrons) and hadronic showers (from\ntaus) may be disentangled by their muon content, as well as the tau track may be measured,\nwhich means that there could be a possibility to disentangle electron and tau neutrino neutrino events (see, e.g., Refs. [27, 28]). An additional process to identify \u03bd\u0304e 's is the Glashow\nresonant process \u03bd\u0304e + e\u2212 \u2192 W \u2212 at 6.3 PeV, which can also be used for oscillation parameter\nmeasurements [20]. For most of this study, we follow Refs. [18, 19] (see also Ref. [29]) and\nuse R = \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03c6e +\u03c6\u03c4 ) as observable, which means that we make the conservative assumption\nthat electron and tau events cannot be disentangled. This observable can be extracted from\nthe ratio of muon tracks to showers [28], but note that there is an additional hadronic shower\nbackground from neutral current events for all flavors which needs to be subtracted. We\nassume that we have a precision measurement of R with an effective relative error exploiting\nall available information and containing all systematics and backgrounds. For example, the\ninformation from different energies and event types may be used to reduce the systematical errors on that quantity (see, e.g., Refs. [26, 30]). Especially using different energies is\nplausible for neutrino telescopes, since we assume that neutrino oscillations are averaged\nout (compared to the beams and reactor experiments, there will be no energy dependence\nof the oscillations). Finally, we assume a signal without any \"new physics\" contamination,\nsuch as neutrino decays [31\u201333].\nFor this study, we will use this effective error on R to formulate the requirements to a\nneutrino telescope to be useful for terrestrial2 neutrino oscillation experiments, i.e., we\n1\n\nNote that since the cross sections increase with energy, the actual event rates are determined by a\nbalance between flux and cross sections.\n2\nFurther on, we refer to the \"terrestrial experiments\" as the experiments with a terrestrial, i.e., Earth-\n\n2\n\n\fwill show the results for different errors and read off the required precision. Of course,\nthe effective error will not only depend on systematics, but also on the number of events\nexpected. This signal height depends on the distance and energy release of the event,\nwhich means that it is not predictable until measured. Typically, several tens of events\nare expected for astrophysical neutrino sources, whereas of the order of hundred events\ncan be expected for electron neutrino appearance at superbeams for large sin2 2\u03b813 \u223c 0.1\n(see, e.g., Ref. [2]). This\n\u221a means that the actual statistical errors from astrophysical sources\nand superbeams (\u221d N ) may not be different by orders of magnitude, and a combination\nof data could make sense \u2013 a hypothesis to be tested in this work. We will typically use\n5%, 10%, and 20% errors on R in order to discuss the requirements to an astrophysical\nmeasurement in the following sections. For example, a precision of \u223c 20% was found in\nRef. [28] for a flux close to the Waxman-Bahcall bound [34, 35] measured by IceCube. This\nflux of E\u03bd2\u03bc dN\u03bd\u03bc /dE\u03bd\u03bc = 10\u22127 GeV cm2 s\u22121 was assumed for one year at IceCube, which\nmeans that higher precisions may be expected for longer running times. Larger fluxes and\ntherefore smaller errors on R could also be obtained for IceCube volume upgrades, optically\nthick sources, galactic sources, or sources not emitting protons at energies the WaxmanBahcall bound is normalized to (see, e.g., Refs. [21, 36]). We illustrate in Appendix A how\nto relate such errors on R to specific event rates in a neutrino telescope, where we also\ndiscuss principle challenges for backgrounds, systematics, and the different sources.\nAstrophysical source identification\nWe assume that the type of the astrophysical source can be identified. The results of this\nstudy are then to be interpreted together with the assumption of that source. In order to\nidentify the source, first of all note that the ratios R for the discussed sources are strongly\nseparated even for different oscillation parameters, which means that a small error on R\nwould instantly be a strong hint for the source determination (R \u223c 0.26, \u223c 0.66, and\n\u223c 0.5, respectively, for neutron beams, muon damped sources, and pion beams, as well as\nsin2 2\u03b813 = 0). In addition, the energy dependence can be used for the source determination\nbecause the flavor composition may change as function of energy in a characteristic, sourcedependent way, such as from a pion beam to a muon damped source [26]. Furthermore,\nassociated signals in gamma or cosmic rays can be used for source identification (see, e.g.,\nRef. [18]). Different flavor ratios also help to identify the source (see, e.g., Ref. [37] even\nfor arbitrary flavor compositions), and the Glashow resonance mentioned above may help\nas well. If an independent source identification is missing, only generic methods, such as\nin Ref. [19], can be used to infer on the neutrino oscillation parameters. In addition, we\nassume that there is little contamination from different production mechanisms producing\ndifferent flavor ratios at the source. For example, neutrons can be generated by collisions of\nhigh energy protons on ambient photons and protons, or in the photo-dissociation of heavy\nnuclei. In the first case, the \u03bd\u0304e from neutron decays would be negligible compared to the\nneutrino flux from pion decays, which means that we effectively have a pion beam source.\nIn the second case, photo-dissociation of heavy nuclei produces a pure \u03bd\u0304e flux, i.e., we have\na neutron beam source. In either case, the obtained flavor composition at the source is\nbased, neutrino source.\n\n3\n\n\frelatively clean.\nIn summary, there might be three interesting sources of information for the neutrino oscillation parameter measurements, which are very complementary, but all suffer from low\nprecisions on a timescale of the coming ten years: Neutrino beams, reactor experiments, and\nastrophysical neutrino flux measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that the combination of the complementary knowledge could allow for early information on the unknown\nneutrino oscillation parameters, while the knowledge and statistics from each individual\nsource will be moderate or poor. Note that, in principle, other complementary information\ncould be obtained from 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2-decay (for the mass hierarchy, see e.g. Ref. [38] and references\ntherein), a galactic supernova explosion (see, e.g., Refs. [39\u201342]), or cosmology (see also\nRef. [43] for a different combination of information). We will not discuss these sources at\nthis place.\nThis study is organized as follows: First, we illustrate and motivate the complementarity\namong superbeams, reactor experiments, and astrophysical sources in Sec. 2. Then we\ndescribe the simulation methods and assumptions used in Sec. 3. The results sections\n(Sec. 4 to Sec. 8) are ordered by the timescale of relevance and level of technicality: In Sec. 4\nwe discuss possible early information on \u03b4CP using reactor experiments and astrophysical\nsources only. In Sec. 5, we illustrate the impact on the mass hierarchy measurements at\nsuperbeams and reactor experiments. Then in Sec. 6, we investigate CP violation and\nCP precision measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate in Sec. 7 how and where in\nparameter space the potential to resolve the octant degeneracy could be improved. Finally,\nwe discuss the impact of the measurement of all flavors in Sec. 8, which turns out to be\nvery useful for pion beams. Note that we do not consider precision measurements of \u03b812 by\nastrophysical fluxes, which have been discussed elsewhere [20].\n\n2\n\nComplementarity terrestrial-astrophysical\n\nIn this section, we illustrate the complementarity between astrophysical sources and terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments, i.e., neutrino beams and reactor experiments. Unless noted otherwise, we use the following set of simulated neutrino oscillation parameters\nthroughout this study [44\u201347]: \u2206m231 = 2.5 * 10\u22123 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b823 = 1, \u2206m221 = 8.2 * 10\u22125 eV2 ,\nsin2 2\u03b812 = 0.83, and sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1 somewhat below the CHOOZ bound [48], \u03b4CP = 0, and\na normal hierarchy.\nIn order to study R \u2261 \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03c6e + \u03c6\u03c4 ) for astrophysical sources, we assume that either the production or detection of the neutrinos is incoherent, or the mass eigenstates loose coherence\nwhile traveling because of the long distances (see, e.g., Ref. [49] for a formal treatment).\nTherefore, any oscillations and CP-violating effects average out in order to obtain\nP\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n|U\u03b1i |2 |U\u03b2i |2\n\n= \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 2\n\nX\ni<j\n\n4\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nU\u03b2j ) .\nU\u03b2i\nRe(U\u03b1i U\u03b1j\n\n(1)\n\n\fIn the simplest cases, one has then for R\nRNeutron beam =\n\nPe\u03bc\nPe\u03bc\n=\n,\nPee + Pe\u03c4\n1 \u2212 Pe\u03bc\n\nP\u03bc\u03bc\nP\u03bc\u03bc\n=\n,\nP\u03bce + P\u03bc\u03c4\n1 \u2212 P\u03bc\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\n2P\u03bc\u03bc + Pe\u03bc\n.\n2P\u03bce + Pee + 2P\u03bc\u03c4 + Pe\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nRMuon damped =\nwhereas for the pion beam\nRPion beam =\n\nNote that the probabilities in these formulas are the averaged ones from Eq. (1). Using the\nstandard parameterization of the mixing matrix U [50] and our standard values of the other\noscillation parameters, one can then calculate R as function of the oscillation parameters\nfor the different sources. We expand R for the different astrophysical sources to first order\nin \u03b813 :\nRNeutron beam \u223c 0.26 + 0.30 \u03b813 cos \u03b4CP ,\n\n(4)\n\nRMuon damped \u223c 0.66 \u2212 0.52 \u03b813 cos \u03b4CP ,\n\n(5)\n\nRPion beam \u223c 0.50 \u2212 0.14 \u03b813 cos \u03b4CP .\n\n(6)\n\nHigher order terms in \u03b813 are relatively small (but not negligible). For neutrino beams,\nhowever, the \u03b4CP -dependent terms in P\u03bce are suppressed by the mass hierarchy, which means\n2\nthat the \u03b813\n-term is the leading term for large \u03b813 . At the first oscillation maximum and in\nvacuum, we find (see, e.g., Ref. [51]):\n2\nP\u03bce \u223c 2 \u03b813\n\u00b1 0.09 \u03b813 sin \u03b4CP ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the plus is for antineutrinos and the minus for neutrinos. Because most of the firstgeneration superbeams are operated close to the first oscillation maximum and have a very\nnarrow beam spectrum, this approximation should be useful for qualitative discussions.\nMost importantly, neutrino beams are dependent on the CP-odd sin \u03b4CP , whereas astrophysical sources are dependent on the CP-even cos \u03b4CP . In addition, the amplitude of the\n2\nsignal for neutrino beams will be determined by \u03b813\n, whereas \u03b813 acts as a perturbation\nfor astrophysical sources. The astrophysical information does not depend on neutrinos or\nantineutrinos, whereas neutrino beams usually exploit exactly this dependence by implementing neutrino and antineutrino channels. Finally, pion and muon-damped sources have\na different sign in front of the cos \u03b4CP -term than neutron beam sources, and therefore the\nroles of \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0 are exchanged.\nWe show in Fig. 1 the exact dependence of the observables R (astrophysical neutrinos) and\nP\u03bce (neutrino beams) on \u03b4CP for different sources. While astrophysical sources have the\nlargest modulation of the amplitude at \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0 because of the cos \u03b4CP -dependence,\nneutrino beams are strongly influenced at \u03b4CP = \u00b1\u03c0/2 because of the sin \u03b4CP -dependence at\nthe oscillation maximum.

However, note that the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos can do only very little close to \u03b4CP = 0 and\n\u03c0.\nIn order to illustrate the measurement precision of \u03b4CP , we show possible error bars for 5%,\n10%, and 20% measurement errors as the shaded bars. From the projection of the curves\nonto these bars, we can immediately read off the required precisions for R and the relevant\nparameter regions in \u03b4CP (for large sin2 2\u03b813 ) for the different sources: For neutron beam\nsources, we may learn something about \u03b4CP already for a 20% error on R \u2013 provided that\n6\n\n\f2\u03a0\nSuperbeam, \u008f\u008f\n\u039d\n3\u00902 \u03a0\n\nMuon damped flux\n\n\u03a0\n\nReactor\n\n\u2206CP\n\nSuperbeam, \u039d\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n0\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\nsin2 2\u039813\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the synergy among superbeams, reactor experiments, and astrophysical fluxes\n(at the example of a muon damped source) in sin2 2\u03b813 -\u03b4CP -space. Shown are the curves for constant\nrates (superbeam, reactor experiment) and constant R (astrophysical flux) going through the best-fit point\nsin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1 and \u03b4CP = \u03c0.\n\u03b4CP is close to 0 or \u03c0. If considerably higher precisions can be achieved, other values of \u03b4CP\ncan be extracted as well. For muon damped sources, the required precision in R is similar.\nFor pion sources, however, only precisions of the order of 5% can help.\nA different way to look at the synergy among superbeams, reactor experiments, and astrophysical fluxes is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this figure, the curves for constant total rates\n(superbeam, reactor experiment) and constant R (astrophysical flux) going through the\nbest-fit point sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1 and \u03b4CP = \u03c0 are shown. For the superbeams, this means that\nwithout spectral information all the points on the respective curves are degenerate, which\nis a good approximation for narrow-band beams. The combination of neutrinos and antineutrinos still leaves a remaining degeneracy between 0 and \u03c0, which can, for large error\nbars, not be resolved by the reactor experiment either, because the degenerate solutions\nare still too close to each other. However, the astrophysical flux has a completely different\ndependence on sin2 2\u03b813 and \u03b4CP , which means that it could disentangle the two values for\n\u03b4CP (0 and \u03c0). Note that all the values on the reactor and astrophysical flux curves are\nexactly degenerate even when using energy information.\nAs far as different measurements are concerned, we expect an impact of the astrophysical\nsources on CP precision measurements (especially for \u03b4CP close to 0 and \u03c0), and for the mass\nhierarchy measurements at the superbeams because the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degeneracy is located at\na different value of (fake) \u03b4CP than the original solution. We have also tested the impact on\nsin2 2\u03b813 exclusion and sin2 2\u03b813 discovery potentials, we we have not found any significant\nimpact. The reason is that these measurements are dominated by the ratio of signal to\nbackground in the appearance channels of the beams, i.e., the absolute event rate determines\n7\n\n\fthe performance. This event rate is, for neutrinos and a normal mass hierarchy, smallest\nclose to \u03b4CP \u223c \u03c0/2 (cf., Fig. 1, lower right panel), i.e., \u03b4CP \u223c \u03c0/2 (or 3\u03c0/2 for the inverted\nhierarchy) limits the performance. Since R for the astrophysical sources does not depend\nstrongly on sin2 2\u03b813 close to \u03b4CP = \u03c0 or 3\u03c0/2, they are of little help (cf., Fig. 1, first three\npanels). Note that information on sin2 2\u03b813 cannot be expected from an astrophysical source\nalone either, because a different combination of \u03b4CP and \u03b823 can easily fake sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.\nFinally, note that R depends on \u03b823 in a different way than P\u03bce for the beams (cf., Refs. [19,\n51]): While R is in some way proportional to \u03b823 by different combinations of powers of sin \u03b823\n2\nand cos \u03b823 , the main sensitivity for the neutrino beams comes from the term \u221d sin2 \u03b823 \u03b813\nterm in P\u03bce . We will discuss this different dependence in Sec. 7.\n\n3\n\nSimulation method\n\nIn order to simulate the impact of R on the future terrestrial neutrino oscillation program,\nwe use a modified version of the GLoBES software [52]. Let us define the input parameter\nvector used for GLoBES as\n\u2212\n\u2192\nx = (\u03b812 , \u03b813 , \u03b823 , \u03b4CP , \u2206m221 , \u2206m231 , \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1n ) ,\nwhere we simulate the combination of n terrestrial experiments with the average matter\ndensities \u03c1i , i.e., we deal with 6 + n parameters. Note that the matter densities are treated\nas oscillation parameters in GLoBES in order to include correlations with matter density\nuncertainties. We implement the \u03c72 as function of the simulated and fit parameter vectors\nas\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n(R(\u2212\nx sim ) \u2212 R(\u2212\nx fit ))\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\u03c7 = \u03c7Terr ( x sim , x fit ) +\n,\n(8)\n\u03c3R2\n\u2192\nwhere \u03c3 = \u03c3 rel * R(\u2212\nx ) is the absolute error on R determined from an astrophysical\nR\n\nR\n\nsim\n\nsource, and \u03c3Rrel is the relative error which we will be using. In this equation, \u03c72Terr is the \u03c72\nin GLoBES describing the terrestrial experiments and external input before marginalization\nover the oscillation parameters, and R is the flux ratio using the exact analytical expressions\nfrom Eq. (1). We marginalize \u03c72 in Eq. (8) over any unused oscillation parameters as defined\nby the specific performance indicator (such as over all parameters except from \u03b4CP for a \u03b4CP\nprecision measurement). Note that R does not depend on the mass squared differences and\nmatter densities, which means that only four of the 6 + n parameters determine the second\nterm of Eq. (8).\n\nAs far as the time scale for this study is concerned, we require substantial information\nfrom both a neutrino telescope and superbeam experiments. Therefore, we discuss neutrino oscillation physics at the end of the first-generation superbeam era, which could be\naround ten years from now (until about 2015-2017). At that time, we assume that data\nfrom MINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA will be available for the part of the terrestrial experiments. In addition, there might be early large reactor experiments, such as the\nDouble Chooz upgrade \"Triple Chooz\" [53], which we do not consider since they are less\nestablished yet. We use the MINOS simulation from Ref. [2] with a total luminosity of\n5 yr \u00d7 3.7 1020 pot/yr and a 5.4 kt magnetized iron calorimeter [3] (the unit \"pot/yr\" refers\n8\n\n\fto \"protons on target per year\"). For Double Chooz, we use the simulation from Ref. [13]\napplied to Double Chooz, i.e., L = 1.05 km and an integrated luminosity of 60 000 unoscillated events [11], corresponding to about three years of data taking with both near and far\ndetectors. For T2K, we use the simulation from Ref. [54] based upon Ref. [4] with a total\nluminosity of 5 yr \u00d7 1.0 1021 pot/yr and a 22.5 kt water Cherenkov detector with neutrino\nrunning only. For NO\u03bdA, we use the simulation from Ref. [55] updated to the numbers from\nRef. [5], i.e., L = 810 km operated 12 km off-axis with 3 yr\u00d76.5 1020 pot/yr for neutrinos and\n3 yr\u00d76.5 1020 pot/yr for antineutrinos and a 30 kt totally active scintillating detector (unless\nstated otherwise). In most cases, we will show the combination of these experiments, unless\nwe use the reactor experiment alone for a somewhat shorter time scale. Note, however, that\nMINOS only has a marginal impact on the final results (i.e., the finally achieved MINOS\nluminosity hardly matters), and the main results will be mainly determined by accumulated\nstatistics from the superbeams and Double Chooz, the mass hierarchy sensitivity of NO\u03bdA,\nand the ability of Double Chooz to cleanly extract sin2 2\u03b813 . From the conceptual point of\nview, we therefore expect that the qualitative results will be hardly affected by the finally\nachieved luminosities as long as the latter experiments are present with sufficient statistics.\nExcept from the information coming from the simulated experiments, we assume an external\nprecision of 5% for each \u2206m221 and \u03b812 . This should approximately correspond to the\nprecision at the time of the data analysis (see, e.g., Ref. [45]). In addition, we include a 5%\nuncertainty on the value of the baseline-averaged matter density, where the uncertainty takes\ninto account matter density uncertainties as well as matter density profile effects [56, 57].\nSince a reactor experiment needs some information on the leading atmospheric parameters,\nwe impose a 10% external error on \u2206m231 for the analysis of a reactor experiment alone.\n\n4\n\nEarly knowledge on \u03b4CP from reactor experiments?\n\nThe next generation of experiments providing some information on sin2 2\u03b813 should be reactor experiments. In particular, Double Chooz could measure sin2 2\u03b813 already by about\n2011 or so [11] before the beams may have started running. Let us assume that sin2 2\u03b813\nis large, i.e., close to the current upper bound. In this case, Double Chooz could measure\nsin2 2\u03b813 relatively precisely (cf., upper right panel of Fig. 3). However, the results will not\ndepend on \u03b4CP , which means that it is impossible to obtain information on \u03b4CP from Double\nChooz alone. In addition, it is difficult to obtain information on \u03b4CP from an astrophysical source alone as well after the other oscillation parameters have been marginalized over\n(cf., upper left panel of Fig. 3). If, however, an astrophysical source is able to provide this\ninformation on a similar timescale as the reactor experiment, one will actually be able to\nlearn something on \u03b4CP already before the superbeams provide results. We show in Fig. 3,\nlower row, two examples for the combination of an astrophysical and Double Chooz signal.\nIn both of these cases with a 10% precision measurement, a range of values of \u03b4CP (arrows)\ncould be excluded at the 90% confidence level. Of course, a CP violation measurement will\nnot be possible because of the low precision and the low sensitivity of the astrophysical\nsources close to maximal CP violation.\nAs far as the dependence on the true \u03b4CP is concerned, \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0 for neutron beam\n\n9\n\n\fDouble Chooz alone\n2\u03a0\n\n3\u00902 \u03a0\n\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\nNeutron beam source alone, 10%\n2\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0.15\nFit value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.2\n\n0.06\n\n0.14\n\nMuon damped source, 10%\n\n2\u03a0\n\n2\u03a0\n\n3\u00902 \u03a0\n\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\nNeutron beam source, 10%\n\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nFit value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n0\n\n0\n0.06\n\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nFit value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.14\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nFit value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.14\n\nFigure 3: Fit regions as function of sin2 2\u03b813 and \u03b4CP for different experiments as given in the plot\ncaptions (the lower row is always in combination with Double Chooz).

If the precision of\nthe astrophysical measurement is only 20%, there will be some hints for some points at\nthe 1\u03c3 confidence level for neutron beam and muon damped sources. A 3\u03c3 exclusion is\nonly possible for a muon damped source if \u03b4CP = 0. In this case, one can actually exclude\n\u03b4CP = \u03c0 at the 3\u03c3 confidence level.\n\n10\n\n\fRunning of sgn-degeneracy HNO\u00eeAL\n2\u03a0\n\n\u2206CP =3\u03a0\u00902\n90% CL\n\nFit value of \u2206fake\nCP\n\n3\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n\u03a0 \u2206CP =\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n\u2206CP =\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u2206CP =0\n0\n10-3\n\n10-2\nTrue value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n10-1\n\nFigure 4: Fake solution \u03b4CP for the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degeneracy as function of the true sin2 2\u03b813 for different\nvalues of the true \u03b4CP as given in the plot.

The\nfirst experiment from the next generation of beam experiments with sufficiently large matter\neffects to determine the mass hierarchy will be NO\u03bdA, i.e., the mass hierarchy sensitivity\nwill be dominated by NO\u03bdA. However, the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degenerate solution of NO\u03bdA, in\ngeneral, appears at a different value of \u03b4CP than the original solution, which means that\nthe correlations with \u03b4CP and sin2 2\u03b813 highly affects the mass hierarchy sensitivity. We\nillustrate in Fig. 4 the running of the fake solution in \u03b4CP -space for this experiment for\ndifferent simulated values of \u03b4CP as function of the true sin2 2\u03b813 . Note that the degeneracy\ncan only be resolved on the right-hand sides of the diamonds of the curves (90% CL). One\ncan identify two sets of fixed points in this graph: For small values of sin2 2\u03b813 , the fake\nsolution is close to the original one (or \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4CP ). For very large sin2 2\u03b813 , the fake solution\nis close to an attractor point which is, for this beam, \u03b4CP = 3\u03c0/2 for the normal hierarchy\nand \u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 for the inverted hierarchy.3 As it is obvious from Fig. 4, a constraint on \u03b4CP\n3\n\nIn order to understand this dependence and attractor points, the concept of bi-probability/bi-rate\ngraphs is useful (cf., Refs. [8, 58\u201360]). For small sin2 2\u03b813 , the original and fake solution \"pencils\" overlap\ncompletely, and the fake solution \u03b4CP is close to the original \u03b4CP or \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4CP (cf., Fig. 2 in Ref. [60]). For very\nlarge sin2 2\u03b813 , where the pencils are separated, the fake solution is close to an attractor point determined\nby the closest point of the fake solution ellipse to the original solution ellipse (for this beam, \u03b4CP = 3\u03c0/2\nfor the normal hierarchy and \u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 for the inverted hierarchy).

The curves are for the following\nerrors on the astrophysical flux ratio: no astrophysical flux observed (thick gray curves), 20% error on R\n(dashed curves), 10% error on R (thin black curves), and 5% error on R (thick black curves).\n\nwould increase the confidence level of the degenerate solution if it was strongly running, i.e.,\nvery different from the original solution. Therefore, we expect an improved mass hierarchy\nsensitivity in combination with an astrophysical neutrino flux.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we show in Fig. 5 the sensitivity to the normal mass\nhierarchy as function of true sin2 2\u03b813 and true \u03b4CP (stacked to the \"Fraction of \u03b4CP \") for\nMINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA combined with an astrophysical neutrino source.\nThe interpretation of this figure is as follows: For large sin2 2\u03b813 , the terrestrial experiments\nalone will only be able to determine the mass hierarchy for about 50% of all possible values\nof \u03b4CP which could be realized by nature. However, using, for instance, a neutrino beam\nsource flux measured with a precision of 20% increases this fraction to 80% of all values\nof \u03b4CP . Therefore, depending on chosen confidence level and precision of the astrophysical\nflux, the chance to discover the mass hierarchy will be improved from about half of all\npossible cases of \u03b4CP to almost certain. Similar results can be expected from a muon\ndamped source, while for a pion beam source the fraction of \u03b4CP will be increased by up\nto 10%. Note that while MINOS, T2K, and Double Chooz combined do not have any\nrelevant sensitivity to the mass hierarchy (cf., Ref. [2]), NO\u03bdA alone could not achieve this\nimpressive result in combination with the astrophysical sources either. Only the combination\nof these experiments will provide the information to disentangle sin2 2\u03b813 , \u03b4CP , and the mass\nhierarchy, as well as it will have sufficient statistics. In addition, we expect qualitatively\nsimilar results for the inverted hierarchy, where the role of \u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2 is exchanged\nfor the superbeams, while the astrophysical sources still provide the relevant information\nclose to \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0.\ntoo small to separate the two pencils sufficiently, i.e., the addition of the astrophysical source would only\nshift the fake solution (still appearing at a low \u2206\u03c72 ).\n\n12\n\n\fNeutron beam source\n\nMuon damped source\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nFraction of HtrueL \u2206CP\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\nFraction of HtrueL \u2206CP\n\nFraction of HtrueL \u2206CP\n\n0.5\n\nPion beam source\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\nTrue value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\nTrue value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08\nTrue value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 6: Sensitivity to CP violation as function of true sin2 2\u03b813 and true \u03b4CP (stacked to the \"Fraction\nof \u03b4CP \") for MINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA combined with an astrophysical neutrino source (as\ngiven in the plot captions) at the 2\u03c3 confidence level (normal mass hierarchy assumed). The curves are for\nthe following errors on the astrophysical flux ratio: no astrophysical flux observed (thick gray curves), 20%\nerror on R (dashed curves), 10% error on R (thin black curves), and 5% error on R (thick black curves).\n\n6\n\nMeasuring \u03b4CP\n\nLearning about \u03b4CP has two aspects: First, we want to measure leptonic CP violation.\nSecond, we want to determine \u03b4CP precisely. Note that these two options are not necessarily\ncorrelated: If, for example, \u03b4CP is very close to (but not equal to) 0 or \u03c0, we will certainly\nnot be able to measure this small CP violation with the next generation of experiments.\nHowever, we may still be able to learn something about \u03b4CP , such as we might exclude\ncertain ranges. While superbeams are targeted towards CP violation, the sensitivity of\nthe astrophysical sources should be best close to CP conservation. Therefore, we expect\nsmall effects for CP violation measurements, and larger effects for CP precision/exclusion\nmeasurements.\nWe show in Fig. 6 the sensitivity to CP violation as function of true sin2 2\u03b813 and fraction of\n\u03b4CP for MINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA combined with an astrophysical neutrino\nsource. Note that the overall fraction of possible values for which this measurement could\nbe done is rather small, i.e., between about 20% and 40% for large sin2 2\u03b813 . The jump from\n20% to 40% comes from enough statistics to reduce the size of the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degenerate\nsolution such that it does not overlap the CP conserving values anymore. Therefore, it is\npresent depending on statistics and chosen confidence level (for instance, for NO\u03bdA alone,\nit is not present). An astrophysical flux measurement could not increase the fraction of \u03b4CP ,\nfor which CP violation is measurable, substantially (because it is most sensitive close to\nthe CP conserving values), but it could increase the reach in sin2 2\u03b813 for about 20% of all\nvalues of \u03b4CP . Note, however, that a similar effect could be achieved with slightly increased\nstatistics.\nCP precision measurements are somewhat more complicated to describe, especially since\nthe discussed experiments rather exclude some ranges of \u03b4CP than they allow for a precision\n13\n\n\fSimulated \u2206CP =0\n\n25\n\n25\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\nD\u03a72\n\n15\n\nSimulated \u2206CP =\u03a0\u00902\n\n30\n\nPrecision of R\n\nD\u03a72\n\n30\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\n0\n\n2\u03a0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nFit value of \u2206CP\n\n2\u03a0\n\nFigure 7: The \u2206\u03c72 as function of the fit value of \u03b4CP for different simulated values of \u03b4CP as given in\nthe plot captions.

For illustrative purposes, we show in Fig. 7 the \u2206\u03c72 as function of the\nfit value of \u03b4CP for two different simulated values. The different curves correspond to no\nastrophysical information (thick gray curves), a 20% measurement of R from a muon damped\nflux (thin curves), and a 5% measurement of R from a muon damped flux (thick black\ncurves), all in combination with the terrestrial experiments. For \u03b4CP = 0 (left plot), the\nimpact of the astrophysical source is obvious: the \u2206\u03c72 for the solution at \u03b4CP = \u03c0 is\ncontinuously lifted with increasing precision of R (arrow). Note that for a 5% precision\nmeasurement of R a precision of \u03b4CP is reached which allows to exclude maximal CP violation\n(\u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2) almost at the 3\u03c3 confidence level. For \u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 (right plot), however,\nthere is hardly any impact until high precisions of R are reached, when the \u2206\u03c72 at \u03b4CP = \u03c0\nis significantly increased. One can easily read off this effect from Fig. 1 (upper right): At\n\u03b4CP = \u03c0/2 the error bars have to be about a factor of two smaller than at \u03b4CP = 0 or \u03c0\nto exclude some ranges in \u03b4CP . As for the CP violation measurement above, the effect at\nthe 2\u03c3 confidence level is small and the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degeneracy is already lifted above this\nconfidence level at \u03b4CP = \u03c0 (the difference between the dashed and solid curves describes\nthe impact of this degeneracy).\nIn order to study the CP exclusion/precision information as function of the simulated \u03b4CP ,\nwe introduce the CP coverage [61]. The CP coverage is defined as range of fit values of \u03b4CP\nwhich fit the chosen true value at a certain \u2206\u03c72 , and lies between 0 (precise determination\n14\n\n\fMuon damped source: 20% constraint\n\nMuon damped source: 5% constraint\n350\n\n300\n\n300\n\n300\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\nCP coverage @DegreesD\n\n350\n\nCP coverage @DegreesD\n\nCP coverage @DegreesD\n\nNo astrophysical constraint\n350\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nTrue value of \u2206CP\n\n2\u03a0\n\n0\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nTrue value of \u2206CP\n\n2\u03a0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\u00902\n\n\u03a0\n3\u00902 \u03a0\nTrue value of \u2206CP\n\n2\u03a0\n\nFigure 8:\n\nCP patterns for MINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA combined for several external\nprecisions on R from an astrophysical muon damped source. The CP patterns quantify the measurement\nof \u03b4CP (CP coverage) as a function of the true value of \u03b4CP (provided by nature) for sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1. The\nCP coverage is defined as range of fit values of \u03b4CP which fit the chosen true value, and can be between 0\n(precise determination of \u03b4CP ) and 360\u25e6 (no information on \u03b4CP ). The thick curves correspond (from dark\nto light) to \u2206\u03c72 = 9, 4, and 1 respectively, and the thin curves represent the results without taking into\naccount the sgn(\u2206m231 )-degeneracy.\n\nof \u03b4CP ) and 360\u25e6 (no information on \u03b4CP ). It is illustrated in Fig. 7 as the gray bar in the\nleft plot for the 5% precision measurement of R and \u2206\u03c72 = 9. We use in Fig. 8 the \"CP\npatterns\" [60], which quantify the measurement of \u03b4CP (CP coverage) as a function of the\ntrue value of \u03b4CP provided by nature. This means that we compute Fig. 7 for all simulated\nvalues of \u03b4CP , read off the CP coverage from each figure, and show this performance indicator\nas function of the simulated \u03b4CP . Fig. 8 shows these CP patterns for MINOS, Double Chooz,\nT2K, and NO\u03bdA alone, as well as combined with a muon damped source for sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1\nclose to the CHOOZ bound [1]. Obviously, how precisely one can measure \u03b4CP or what range\nof values one could exclude strongly depends on the chosen confidence level.4 However, it\nis obvious from this figure that astrophysical sources could especially help in the first two\nquadrants where the degeneracy problem is present (for a normal hierarchy, for the inverted\nhierarchy it is the third and fourth quadrants), and close to 0 and \u03c0. The CP patterns\nfor a neutron beam source are qualitatively similar, whereas the pion beam source requires\nhigher precisions.\nThe structure of the patterns in Fig. 8 is highly non-trivial. In particular, for the terrestrial\nexperiments only, the precision is best close to \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0 at the 1\u03c3 confidence level,\nand worst at these points at 3\u03c3. That is because the precision of \u03b4CP depends very much\non the size of the error bars. Going back to Fig. 1 (lower right) and studying the impact\nof the error bars (shaded bars, terrestrial neutrino beams), one can read off that for small\nerrors, the precision will be best close to 0 and \u03c0 as P\u03bce leaves the simulated value very\nquickly.

[60]).\nNote that the size of the error bars depends on statistics as well as the chosen confidence\nlevel. Therefore, one expects a behavior strongly dependent on the confidence level for\nCP precision measurements (see, e.g., Ref. [61]). This argument can be translated to the\nastrophysical sources, where it will occur for 0 and \u03c0 exchanged with \u00b1\u03c0/2. Therefore, we\ncan understand this very complementary information from these two data sources.\nIn order to compare the confidence level dependence and dependence on the astrophysical\nsource more quantitatively, we show in Fig. 9 the impact of different astrophysical flux ratio\nmeasurements on the CP coverage for the true values of \u03b4CP = 0 (left) and \u03c0 (right). In\nthis figure, the different vertical lines in the bars correspond to 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%\nmeasurements of R (from left to right), as well as to no astrophysical measurement (right\nedges of bars). Selected precisions are marked with arrows and numbers. The results depend\nvery much on the confidence level, value of \u03b4CP , and flux used. However, one can read off\nthis figure that even a 30% measurement of a neutron beam or muon damped flux can have\na substantial impact (2\u03c3, \u03b4CP = 0). In addition, a 10% precision of these fluxes would allow\nfor an exclusion of certain ranges at 3\u03c3.

Note, however, that without additional knowledge on the other mixing parameters, this information can only be extracted\nfrom R in very specific cases, but in a rather model-independent way [19]. We demonstrate\nin this section that the complementarity among superbeams, reactor experiments, and astrophysical sources allows for an exclusion of the octant degeneracy for any substantial\ndeviation from maximal mixing. For illustration, we show in Fig. 10 the observables (R for\nastrophysical sources, total event rates for the beam) for the octant degeneracy resolution\nas function of sin2 \u03b823 for sin2 2\u03b813 = 0 (left) and sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1 (right).

In order to discuss the potential to resolve the octant degeneracy,\ncompare the left branch of each source (sin2 \u03b823 < 0.5) with the right branch (sin2 \u03b823 > 0.5).\nIf we assume that a reactor experiment determines sin2 2\u03b813 fairly well and the impact of\nthe unknown \u03b4CP is one of the main uncertainties, this picture should be quite accurate.\nFor sin2 2\u03b813 = 0, the situation is quite simple because, in this limit, \u03b4CP is meaningless.\nThe superbeam disappearance channel measures sin2 2\u03b823 very precisely, but it does not\nhave information on the octant. The rates in the appearance channel are too low to imply\nany information, and reactor experiment is not affected by \u03b823 (and therefore not shown).\nHowever, the flux ration R of the astrophysical sources is very different for sin2 \u03b823 < 0 and\nsin2 \u03b823 > 0, which means that a resolution of the octant degeneracy should be possible.\n17\n\n\fTerrestrial vs. Terrestrial + Muon damped H20%L\n0.7\n\nTrue value of sin2 \u039823\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\nNo sensitivity\nNo sensitivity\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nExcluded H3\u03a3L\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n0.06\nTrue value of sin2 2\u039813\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 11: Exclusion of the octant degeneracy as function of sin2 2\u03b813 and sin2 \u03b823 at the 1\u03c3 (thin black\ncurves), 2\u03c3 (thin gray curves), and 3\u03c3 (thick black curves) confidence level.

Figure for \u03b4CP = 0 and a normal mass hierarchy.\n\nHowever, for large sin2 2\u03b813 , the situation is different: The uncertainties on \u03b4CP and sin2 2\u03b813\n(not shown) should affect the astrophysical sources. The beam, on the other hand, now has\na substantial appearance rate with some information on the octant. We therefore conclude\nthat the measurement for small sin2 2\u03b813 should be dominated by the astrophysical source,\nwhereas the measurement for large sin2 2\u03b813 could be dominated by the beam (plus reactor\nexperiment). The latter hypothesis needs to be quantified, because it it unclear from Fig. 10\nhow the correlations with the other oscillation parameters affect the degeneracy.\nIn order to demonstrate the resolution of the octant degeneracy quantitatively, we show\nin Fig. 11 the exclusion of the octant degeneracy as function of sin2 2\u03b813 and sin2 \u03b823 . The\nshaded areas show the results from the terrestrial experiments only (MINOS, Double Chooz,\nT2K, and NO\u03bdA combined), whereas the dashed curves show the combination with a 20%\nprecision measurement of a muon damped flux as a representative example. Note that, for\ninstance, NO\u03bdA alone could not resolve the octant degeneracy because of the correlation\nwith sin2 2\u03b813 and \u03b4CP . However, it is the combination between NO\u03bdA and Double Chooz\nwhich allows for the degeneracy resolution for large sin2 2\u03b813 (shaded contours). As expected,\nthe terrestrial experiments alone cannot resolve the degeneracy for small sin2 2\u03b813 , while\nthe combination with a muon damped source (or similarly a neutron beam source) can.\nNote that this effect for small sin2 2\u03b813 is qualitatively comparable to the combination of\natmospheric and long-baseline data using a megaton-size Water-Cherenkov detector [62,63],\nwhile it may be available at a shorter time scale. As far as the dependence on the simulated\n\u03b4CP is concerned, we observe similar small qualitative effects as in Ref. [62].\n18\n\n\fsin2 2\u039813 =0\n\nsin2 2\u039813 =0.1\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\nPion beam\nMuon damped source\n0.6 Terrestrial alone\nTrue value of sin2 \u039823\n\nTrue value of sin2 \u039823\n\n0.6\nNeutron beam\nNo sensitivity\nNo sensitivity\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nExcluded H3\u03a3L\n0.3\n0.1\n0.05\n\nExcluded H3\u03a3L\n0.3\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0.2\n0.15\nRel. error on R\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nNo sensitivity\nNo sensitivity\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n0.15\nRel. error on R\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 12: Exclusion of the octant degeneracy (above upper and below lower curves) as function of\nthe precision of R and sin2 \u03b823 at the 2\u03c3 confidence level.

The different curves are\ncomputed for the combination of different fluxes (neutron beam: thick curves; muon damped source: thin\ncurves; pion beam: dashed curves) with the terrestrial experiments. In the right plot, the result from the\nterrestrial experiments alone is shown as well. The gray-shaded areas mark the 3\u03c3 excluded region [47].\nFigure for \u03b4CP = 0 and a normal mass hierarchy.\n\nSince the dependence on sin2 2\u03b813 is quite straightforward for all astrophysical sources, we\nfocus in Fig. 12 on the two physics cases sin2 2\u03b813 = 0 (small) and sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.1 (large).\nThe figure shows the dependence of the octant resolution on the relative error on R for\ndifferent astrophysical sources. In the case sin2 2\u03b813 = 0, where the terrestrial experiments\nalone do not provide any substantial information, a 10% to 20% precision of R from a\nneutron beam or muon damped flux would be very useful for a 10% deviation from maximal\nmixing. For a pion beam source, however, the precision has to be very high. Note that even\nfor poor measurements of a neutron beam flux some information for significant deviations\nfrom maximal mixing (but still within the currently allowed 3\u03c3 range) could be obtained.\nFor large sin2 2\u03b813 , a 10% to 20% precision of R from a neutron beam or muon damped flux\ncould improve the reach in \u03b823 by a factor of two compared to the terrestrial experiments\nalone. However, beyond that the effect saturates quickly and the terrestrial experiments\ndominate the potential to resolve the degeneracy completely. Therefore, an astrophysical\nflux will be especially useful for small values of sin2 2\u03b813 . Note that, compared to Ref. [62],\nwe have not considered mixed degeneracies (wrong octant and wrong mass hierarchy) in this\nstudy, but we expect that one could exclude this degeneracy as well if the octant and wrong\nhierarchy alone can be excluded (similar to Ref. [62]). In addition, we have only considered\nthe exclusion of the octant degeneracy, which is much more difficult than the exclusion of\nmaximal mixing (which can be done with the disappearance channel at beams).

The shaded bars illustrate the size of the 5%, 10%, and 20%\nerrors for the chosen central values (horizontal lines).\n\nsince the exclusion of the octant degeneracy is sufficient to exclude maximal mixing (but not\nnecessary), we do know that there will be some sensitivity to deviations from maximal mixing\nas well. We expect this to be much weaker than the one coming from the disappearance\nchannels of the beams via the sin2 2\u03b823 -dependence independent of sin2 2\u03b813 .\n\n8\n\nWhat if one can actually measure all flavors?\n\nSo far, we have assumed that we cannot discriminate \u03bde and \u03bd\u03c4 shower events and we have\nused R = \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03c6e + \u03c6\u03c4 ) as an observable. However, in principle, electromagnetic (from \u03bde )\nand hadronic showers (from \u03bd\u03c4 ) can be distinguished by their muon content. In addition, for\nlarge enough energies, the tau track can be separated from the shower and may be identified\nby following double-bang and lollipop events (see Refs. [28,64] and references therein). Since\nwe do not know the flux normalization, we can describe the neutrino oscillation physics by\ntwo independent quantities completely. We choose R, as before, and S \u2261 \u03c6e /\u03c6\u03c4 which could\nbe extracted from the ratio of electromagnetic to hadronic shower events.5 We expect that\nthis quantity might be determined with a lower precision than R, and it only becomes an\nobservable for higher energies. This could make it an interesting additional observable for\nastrophysical pion beam sources.\nIn order to discuss the qualitative dependence of the observable S on \u03b4CP , we show it\nin Fig. 13 for the different discussed sources. Note that we again illustrate the size of\nthe relative errors as the shaded bars. Comparing Fig. 13 to Fig. 1 illustrates that for\nmuon damped sources and pion beam sources the functions are decreasing in \u03b4CP instead of\nincreasing. Thus, a combination between S and R should compensate the difference from\nstatistics between \u03b4CP = 0 and \u03c0 somewhat. Comparing the error bars in these figures\nFig. 1 and Fig. 13, there are, however, no major qualitative differences between S and R,\n5\n\nNote that neutral currents produce hadronic showers, too. In this case, we refer to the hadronic showers\nfrom \u03bd\u03c4 events only.\n\n20\n\n\fImprovement of CP coverage for \u2206CP =0 H2\u03a3L\n0.4\n0.35\n\n>10%\n\n>20%\n\n>30%\n\n>40%\n\n0.25\n\n>50%\n\nRelative error on R\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n0.15\n0.25\nRelative error on S\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 14: Relative improvement of the CP coverage for \u03b4CP = 0 as function of the relative errors on\nS and R for the combination of the terrestrial experiments MINOS, Double Chooz, T2K, and NO\u03bdA with\nan astrophysical pion beam flux (2\u03c3 confidence level).\nwhich means that we do not expect additional synergistic information. In particular, for\nneutron beams and muon damped sources, the modulation of S is comparable to the one\nof R, which means that one would not expect major improvements except from increased\nstatistics \u2013 especially given the fact that the expected precision of S may be weaker than\nthe one of R due to lower efficiencies. The most interesting observation is probably the\ndependence of S on \u03b4CP for the pion beam source, which is stronger than for R. Therefore,\nfuture precision measurements with high statistics (such as at IceCube volume upgrades)\nmay find S a useful observable for standard pion sources. The same applies, in principle,\nto the dependence on \u03b823 (not shown). We therefore focus on pion beams in this section.\nAs a first example, let us study the dependence of the CP coverage on the relative errors of\nS and R from a pion beam source. Therefore, we show in Fig. 14 the relative improvement\nof the CP coverage from the terrestrial experiments for \u03b4CP = 0 at the 2\u03c3 confidence level.\nIn this figure, the upper right corner (white area) corresponds to no improvement of the terrestrial case and large errors on the astrophysical observables, whereas the lower left corner\ncorresponds to very precise measurements of S and R. If we a assume a measurement of\neither S or R, we can read off this figure the required precision for a specific improvement.\nFor example, for a 10% improvement of the CP coverage, a 27% precision of S (intersection of 10% contour with right vertical axis) or a 17% precision of R (intersection of 10%\ncontour with upper horizontal axis) are equally helpful. Obviously, the precision of S has\nto be substantially lower (by about a factor of two) than the precision of R to achieve the\nsame result. For a 40% improvement, there is even a factor of three between the required\nprecisions. One can also read off this figure that there are no real synergies between S and\nR: If both quantities are measured, one cannot expect an improvement beyond what is\n21\n\n\f0.7\nPion beam, R\nPion beam, S\n\nTrue value of sin2 \u039823\n\n0.6\n\nNo sensitivity\nNo sensitivity\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nExcluded H3\u03a3L\n0.3\n0.1\n0.05\n\n0.2\n0.15\nRel. error\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 15: Exclusion of the octant degeneracy as function of either the relative error on R or S,\nand sin2 \u03b823 at the 2\u03c3 confidence level for sin2 2\u03b813 = 0.

We illustrate its impact in Fig. 15, where we show the exclusion of the\noctant degeneracy (same sign of \u2206m231 ) as function of the relative error on S or R at the\n2\u03c3 confidence level. In this figure, sensitivity is given above the upper and below the lower\ncurves. One can easily read off this figure that the precision of S has to be much lower\nthan the one of R in order to do this measurement. Even a 30% error could eliminate some\nthis degeneracy in a part of the currently allowed 3\u03c3 allowed region of the parameter space,\nand a 10% error could eliminate the degeneracy for not too large deviations from maximal\nmixing.\nAt the end it will be a matter of statistics which of the two observables S and R can be\nmeasured better. In principle, if each shower in the detector (used for R) was identified\nunambiguously, the precisions of S and R should be approximately comparable. That\nis because the neutrinos arrive approximately in the flavor ratio (1:1:1) for this type of\nsource [27], which means that comparable relative errors of R and S should require similar\nevent rates (somewhat depending on the efficiency ratio between track and shower events;\nsee discussion in Appendix A). In practice, the precisions of S and R may be very different\nbecause of the required higher energies for the shower identification and backgrounds from\nmis-identification. Note, however, that the factor of two to three lower required precision\n6\n\nFor Gaussian\nerrors, the addition of two external measurements with an equal \u2206\u03c72 leads to about a\n\u221a\nfactor of 1/ 2 smaller measurement error.\n\n22\n\n\fof S from physics corresponds to about a factor of four to ten lower event rate. Therefore,\ndepending on the actual neutrino flux from the source (and the energies), S could be an\ninteresting observable as well.\n\n9\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nIn summary, we have studied the requirements for an astrophysical flux measurement from\na neutron beam source, muon damped source, and pion beam source at a neutrino telescope to be relevant for the neutrino oscillation program using terrestrial sources (reactors\nor accelerators). We have used the ratio R = \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03c6e + \u03c6\u03c4 ) as our main observable, which\ncan be extracted from the ratio between muon track and shower events in a neutrino telescope such as IceCube. This ratio might be measured at relatively low energies at IceCube,\nsince the threshold for muon tracks is about 100 GeV, and for showers about 1 TeV.7 We\nhave illustrated the complementarity of the observables R (astrophysical fluxes), P\u0113\u0113 (reactor experiments), and P\u03bce or P\u03bc\u0304\u0113 (superbeams) with respect to their \u03b4CP -dependence:\nThe observable of reactor experiments has no \u03b4CP -dependence, the one of first-generation\nsuperbeams depends on sin \u03b4CP (at the oscillation maximum), and the one of astrophysical\nneutrino sources on cos \u03b4CP . This complementarity has lead to a number of interesting observations for large sin2 2\u03b813 : First, we have demonstrated that a 10% precision measurement\nfrom a neutron beam or muon damped source may lead to a first observation of \u03b4CP together\nwith Double Chooz, especially if the true \u03b4CP is close to \u03b4CP = 0 or \u03c0. This means that,\ndepending on the time scale of the neutrino telescopes, \u03b4CP may be restricted before the\nsuperbeams T2K and NO\u03bdA start operation. Second, we have demonstrated that a 10% to\n20% precision of the ratio R = \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03c6e + \u03c6\u03c4 ) coming from a neutron beam or muon damped\nsource, or a 5% precision from a pion beam would be beneficial for mass hierarchy and \u03b4CP\nmeasurements because of two factors: The cos \u03b4CP -dependence of R improves the precision\nof \u03b4CP close to 0 and \u03c0, and the additional restriction on the parameter space prohibits the\nsgn(\u2206m231 )-degeneracy (mainly determined by NO\u03bdA) to move in \u03b4CP -space. For example, a\nmoderately precise measurement of R from a neutron or muon damped source could enhance\nthe chance to measure the mass hierarchy from about 50:50 to almost for sure. In addition,\nwe have found that for small values of sin2 2\u03b813 , where the beams and reactor experiments\nalone do not have significant sensitivity, an astrophysical neutrino flux may exclude the\noctant degeneracy (for large sin2 2\u03b813 , reactor experiments and superbeams combined can\nalready resolve this degeneracy). This application may provide constraints earlier than from\natmospheric neutrinos and beams using a megaton Water Cherenkov detector [62].\nBeyond the measurement of the muon track to shower ratio, we have discussed the impact of\nall-flavor identification. Therefore, we have introduced S = \u03c6e /\u03c6\u03c4 as an additional observable at higher energies (possibly using detector upgrades) which could be extracted from the\nelectromagnetic to hadronic shower ratio. We have demonstrated that this observable could\nbe especially interesting for pion beam sources, which might be the most likely sources to be\nobserved at a neutrino telescope. The required relative precision of S has to be much weaker\n7\n\nHowever, it is difficult to differentiate electromagnetic (from \u03bde ) from hadronic (from \u03bd\u03c4 ) showers at\nleast below several PeV. Therefore, we have added the electromagnetic and hadronic shower events in R.\n\n23\n\n\fthan on R for this type of source because of the stronger \u03b4CP -dependence, where the role of\nS is similar to the one of R for \u03b4CP , mass hierarchy, and octant degeneracy measurements.\nAs far as the different sources are concerned, neutron beams and muon damped sources\nallow for the highest impact on the terrestrial program, which is, from the point of view of\nstatistics, already present for several tens of events. However, neutrinos from neutron decays\nhave a flux rapidly deceasing with energy and face the atmospheric neutrino background due\nto the steadiness of the source [23]. Muon damped fluxes, i.e., neutrinos from pion decays\nnot followed by muon decays (which are absorbed before they can decay), occur in specific\nastrophysical models [25], and pion beams may turn into these sources at high energies [26].\nTherefore, neutrinos from pion decays could be the astrophysical neutrino source with most\nstatistics. Pion beams, however, have the highest requirement with respect to precision.\nThere are several arguments in favor of these sources. First, as indicated above, shower\n(all-flavor) identification might help for pion beams. Second, because it may be the most\nlikely sources, statistics from different sources and neutrino telescopes may accumulate. And\nthird, once such fluxes are detected, fiducial volume upgrades of neutrino telescopes could\neasily increase statistics. Therefore, pion beams may not only have the highest requirements,\nbut also the best prospects.\nWith respect to time scales, IceCube [15] will be continuously deployed in the coming years,\nand other neutrino telescopes are in preparation as well [14,16,17]. Double Chooz may have\naccumulated significant data by 2011 or 2012, and the superbeams T2K and NO\u03bdA may\nstart data taking around that time. Beyond the coming ten years, other superbeam upgrades\nwill follow, such as wide band beams [65] with a relatively wide energy spectrum. It is\nimportant to emphasize that astrophysical data can only be relevant for neutrino oscillation\nphysics in the coming decade or at most fifteen years. For the discussed large values of\nsin2 2\u03b813 , mass hierarchy, and \u03b4CP measurements will thereafter be certainly provided by\nsuperbeam upgrades having enough statistics (see, e.g., Ref. [66]), and the complementarity\nwith respect to the cos \u03b4CP -dependence will be provided by broad band superbeams, \u03b2Beams, superbeams operated off the oscillation maximum, or neutrino factories. For small\nvalues of sin2 2\u03b813 , atmospheric neutrinos and superbeam upgrades can exclude the octant\ndegeneracy using megaton Water Cherenkov detectors [62, 63].\nWe conclude that it is worth to study the ability of neutrino telescopes to extract the discussed observables for neutrino oscillation physics, since this information may have a major\nimpact on the neutrino oscillation program for the coming decade. Of course, the exact\nprocedure and obtainable precision may require further research and the actual detection of\na source. In addition, the interpretation of the data from all the discussed experiments will\ndepend on the model of the astrophysical source. However, important hints for the planning\nof future experiments may be obtained early from the combination of a set of experiments\nwith poor or moderate statistics each, but great synergistic potential.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank John Beacom, Carlos Pe\u00f1a-Garay, Thomas Schwetz, and Eli Waxman\nfor useful discussions and comments, as well as Patrick Huber for the collaborative effort\nto update the NO\u03bdA simulation.

We also discuss principle challenges for the different astrophysical\nneutrino sources.\nWe assume that all simulated rates Ti and observed (fit) rates Oi are composed of signal\nevents Si and background events Bi , i.e.,\nTi = Sith + Bith ,\nOi = Siobs + Biobs ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere i corresponds to the muon tracks (i = 1) and (non-muon track) showers (i = 2).\nNow Rth \u2261 \u01eb\u0302\u22121 S1th /S2th and Robs \u2261 \u01eb\u0302\u22121 S1obs /S2obs describe the simulated and observed ratios\nbetween muon tracks and showers. Note that these flux ratios have to be corrected by\nthe ratio \u01eb\u0302 of the efficiencies for muon track to shower detection \u01eb\u0302 \u2261 \u01eb1 /\u01eb2 . Usually these\nefficiencies should be fairly well known. They depend on the fiducial volume (which can be\ndifferent for different event types), cuts to reduce backgrounds, chosen energies, etc.. For\nthe sake of simplicity, we will assume \u01eb\u0302 = 1 in most cases, i.e., that muon tracks and showers\nare identified with the same efficiencies. For IceCube, one can easily derive \u01eb\u0302 from Fig. 11 in\nRef. [28] (see erratum) for the flux chosen therein. One finds \u01eb\u0302 \u223c 6 to 7 for a muon energy\nthreshold of 100 GeV, and \u01eb\u0302 \u223c 3 for a muon energy threshold of 1 TeV (muon damped or\npion flux; \u01eb\u0302 \u2243 Muons/Showers * R\u22121 ). Therefore, we will use \u01eb\u0302 = 7 for demonstration in\nsome cases. Note that, in practice, the situation is more complicated and the mapping from\nincident to reconstructed neutrino energy needs to be described by the energy response\nfunction (usually a matrix, which describes the reconstruction at different energies). For\nexample, some muon track events are partially contained (unless only the fully contained\nevents are selected), which means that the muons are already loosing energy outside the\ndetector. Thus, in general, \u01eb\u0302 is a function of energy and therefore depends on the actual\nflux. In addition, since the muon range depends on energy (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in Ref. [67]), the\neffective fiducial volume for partially contained events is energy dependent, as well as the\nevent rates somewhat depend on the flavor composition. Here we assume that the energy\nresponse of the detector is known, and that \u01eb\u0302 represents the integrated efficiency ratio for\nthe flux observed.8\n8\n\nIn practice, the efficiencies for electromagnetic and hadronic shower detection are somewhat different,\ntoo, which means that the actual observable is R\u2032 = \u03c6\u03bc /(\u03ba\u0302 \u03c6e + \u03c6\u03c4 ). From Fig. 11 in Ref. [28] one can\nextract \u03ba\u0302 \u223c 0.7 for the flux and cuts chosen therein. For this value, the relative error on R\u2032 translates into\nthe relative error on R by multiplication with a factor of \u223c 1.1 to 1.3 for the discussed sources, whereas the\nqualitative dependence of R\u2032 on sin2 2\u03b813 and \u03b4CP stays the same. Since this relative efficiency depends on\nthe instrument and analysis, we do not use it in this study.\n\n25\n\n\fLet us introduce some simple systematics, too:\nO1 = (1 + a) + (1 + b) B1 ,\nO2 =\n\n(1 + a)\n+ (1 + c) B2 ,\n\u01eb\u0302 Robs\n\n(10)\n\nwhere a, b and c are systematics auxiliary variables to be minimized over, and Bi = Bith\nare the predicted background events for muon tracks and showers. Thus, a describes the\nunknown normalization of S1 (arbitrary, therefore we have not included it in the formula),\nwhich is, however, fully correlated between muon track and shower events. Furthermore,\nb and c describe the background normalization for muon tracks and showers, respectively.\nNow we can define a very simple Gaussian \u03c72 as\n2\n\n\u03c7 =\n\n2\nX\n(Ti \u2212 Oi )2\ni=1\n\nTi\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\nb\n\u03c3b\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\nc\n\u03c3b\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3b and \u03c3c are the muon track and shower background normalization errors, respectively, and the auxiliary variable a remains unconstrained. Now we can compute the error\non Robs for certain assumptions for the event rates T1 and T2 (related by Rth ) and for\nsystematics by marginalization over the systematics auxiliary variables a, b, and c.\nAs far as backgrounds are concerned, these can be very different depending on the type\nof the source. Let us focus on the atmospheric neutrino background in this example. The\natmospheric neutrino background makes several ten thousands of \u03bd\u03bc events per year for\nE\u03bd > 100 GeV, several thousands per year for E\u03bd > 1 TeV, and about one hundred per year\nfor E\u03bd > 10 TeV (see, e.g., Ref. [68]). Therefore, it clearly is a problem at low energies.\nNow there are different principle strategies to reduce this background, such as:\n1. Good angular resolution\n2. Short timescale of event\n3. Cut low energy events\nFor IceCube, the good angular resolution works for muon track events (\u223c 0.7\u25e6 ), but not\nfor shower events (\u223c 25\u25e6 ) [28]. However, other neutrino telescopes may have a better\nangular resolution. The second approach helps for all short-timescale events. For instance,\nfor gamma ray bursts, the atmospheric neutrino background should be negligible because\nof the short duration. The third approach can be useful for any source producing very\nhigh-energetic neutrinos. In summary, these strategies could be useful for many types of\nsources, such as muon damped fluxes. However, the observation of R for the neutron beams\nis particularly challenging because of the steadiness of the source and the flux dominating\nwhere the atmospheric neutrino background is large [23]. Therefore, we conclude that the\nspecific systematics needs further study and clearly lies beyond the scope of this work.\nWe show in Table 1 the event rates for muon tracks and showers for different hypotheses\nand systematics assumptions. Note that, as opposed to what is assumed for the rest of\n26\n\n\fthis work, the errors are often not symmetric. As one can read off this table, backgrounds\nbecome important as soon as the background rates are of the order of the signal rates. For\nbackground free measurements and \u01eb\u0302 = 1, we find, depending on the source, a minimum\nof about 30 to 50 events necessary for a 20% precision measurement, 100 to 150 events for\na 10% precision measurement, and about 500 events for a 5% precision measurement. In\nthis case, the statistics is determined by the muon track event rate, whereas for larger \u01eb\u0302 the\nshower event rate becomes more important.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Apollonio et al.
