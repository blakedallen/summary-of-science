There is a large\nanisotropy of the effective masses, e.g., for the\nconduction band m\u22a5\u2217 = 0.023m0 and m\u2225\u2217 = 0.2m0 .\nAnother unique feature of PbTe is its paraelectric\nbehavior leading to a huge static dielectric constant \uf065 \uf0bb\n1600 at liquid helium temperatures.11 This causes a\nscreening of the Coulomb potentials of defects and,\ntogether with the small effective masses, results in very\nhigh carrier mobilities in bulk PbTe that can reach values\nexceeding 106 cm2/Vs (see Table 1). Furthermore, the\neffective screening reduces potential fluctuations at the\nnanometer scale, so that PbTe nanowires show onedimensional conductance quantization, even if they\ncontain quite a large number of impurities in their\nvicinity.12,13 Therefore, PbTe turns out to be a good\ncandidate for quantum ballistic devices. We expect that\nthese unique properties might be also fruitful in the\ncontext of S/Sm junctions. In particular, one expects that\nthe role of interface defects, which arise due to\ndissimilarity of the two materials, namely, the\nsuperconducting metal and the semiconductor should be\nsignificantly reduced.5\nThe goal of the present work is the experimental\ndemonstration of these expectations using indium as a\nsuperconductor. However, in order to exploit the\nadvantages of PbTe one has to obtain a highly\ntransparent S/Sm junction. We have fabricated a variety\nof S/Sm structures using both bulk PbTe crystals as well\nas PbTe quantum wells (QWs). Different forms of In\nelectrodes have been used, either thin deposited In\nlayers or bulk In spots. They have been attached to PbTe\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is well known that the Andreev reflection which\noccurs at superconductor-normal conductor interfaces is\na source of a proximity effect, which transfers\nsuperconducting correlations into the normal\nconductor.1,2 If the normal part of the junction consists of\na semiconductor, the induced superconductivity will be\ntunable by the application of gate voltage. In order to\nrealize this idea, superconductor-semiconductor (S/Sm)\nstructures have been studied for more than two\ndecades.3,4 However, the main challenge is the presence\nof the Schottky barrier at the interface between\nsemiconductors and superconducting metals. The bestknown exception is a narrow gap semiconductor InAs,\nwhere a naturally occurring surface accumulation layer\n(n-type) prevents the Schottky barrier formation.5 For\nthis compound, the majority of the operating S/Sm\nstructures, like Josephson field-effect transistors6 or\nelectron-pair entanglers,7 have been demonstrated.\nHowever, for further development and practical\napplications of these devices, a wider variety of useful\nS/Sm systems is desirable.\nLead telluride PbTe, a narrow gap semiconductor,\ncan be considered as an alternative for InAs. This IV-VI\ncompound, which is widely used in thermoelectric\ndevices8 and infrared detectors,9 exhibits unusual\nelectronic and lattice dynamical properties. It has a\nmulti-valley band structure with nearly mirror-like\nconduction and valence bands edges at L-point of the\nBrillouin zone.10 The surfaces of constant energy are four\n\n1\n\n\f2. Superconductor/semiconductor contacts\n\u2013 theory\n\nusing various methods, either by pressing (Fig. 1 a) or by\nemploying multi-level e-beam lithography [Fig. 1(c),\n1(d)]. Such a wide variety of samples allows us to draw\ngeneral conclusions about the nature of phenomena\ntaking place at the In/PbTe interface.\n\nIn order to describe the conductance through metalsemiconductor contacts, in the case when the metal is\neither in the normal or superconducting state, one can\nuse the theory developed by Beenakker.14 For the\nnormal state, the conductance is expressed by the wellknown Landauer formula:\n\nGNN\n\n2e2 N\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5 Ti\nh i \uf03d1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ti denotes the transmission magnitude for the\ni-th conduction channel in the contact. For the\nsuperconductor state, Eq. 1 has been modified to:\n\nGSN \uf03d\n\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of structures employed for\ninvestigation of the In/PbTe contact resistance: (a) pressed In contact\nto bulk PbTe; (b) evaporated In contact onto bulk PbTe, connected to\nthe measuring circuit by means of a pressed In contact (c); In contact\nfabricated by means of electron beam lithography to\nPbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi quantum well.

In order to employ Eqs.\n1 and 2 for an analysis of experimental data, one usually\nassumes that the transmission magnitudes are the same\nfor all channels, Ti = T. Additionally, in the case under\nconsideration N >> 1, meaning that the quasi-classical\napproximation holds, so that the number of conducting\nmodes for the three dimensional (3D) contact can be\nexpressed as N \u2248 kF2 A/4\u03c0, where kF is the Fermi\nwavevector and A is the contact area. Then Eq. 1 takes\nthe form:\n\nWe have found that, in contrast to InAs, a surface\ndepletion layer is formed in n-type PbTe, which prevents\na direct formation of the barrier-less contact. This was\ndemonstrated by the deposition of pure Pb as contact.\nThe deposition of In, however, created an excellent\ncontact even through this barrier because it alloys with\nPbTe. What is most surprising, is that the alloy phase\nexhibits a superconducting transition at helium\ntemperatures, which leads to a substantial reduction of\nthe contact resistance. It approaches the limit expected\nfor an ideally transmitting and uniform S/Sm junction.\nWe present arguments that such behavior is a result of\nunique paraelectric properties of PbTe.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. Section 2\ncontains some theoretical information on S/Sm contacts\nand formulas used for the interpretation of the\nexperimental data. In Section 3, existing experimental\ndata on PbTe surface properties and In/PbTe interfaces\nare reviewed. In Section 4 we present properties of the\nstarting materials and the fabrication procedures\nemployed for obtaining the In/PbTe contacts. Section 5\ncontains the description of experimental findings,\nincluding structural data on the In/PbTe interfaces,\nresults of the contact resistance measurements as a\nfunction of temperature, and the data on magnetic\nsusceptibility. Section 6 presents a discussion of the\nresults and their implications concerning the origin of\nthe interface superconductivity. Section 7 contains a\nsummary and conclusions of the paper.\n\nGNN (3D) \uf03d 1\n\nRNN (3D)\n\n\uf03d\n\n2e2 kF 2 A .\nT\nh 4\uf070\n\n(3)\n\nFor T = 1, this is the well-known Sharvin formula.15\nFor the 2D case, N \u2248 kF W/\u03c0, where W is the contact\nwidth, and we have:\n\nGNN (2 D) \uf03d 1\n\nRNN (2 D)\n\n\uf03d\n\n2e2 kFW .\nT\nh \uf070\n\n(4)\n\nIf the metal is in a superconducting state, Eq. 2 is\ngiven by\nGSN (3D) \uf03d 1\n\nRSN (3D)\n\n\uf03d\n\n4e2 kF2 A ' T '2 ,\nh 4\uf070 (2 \uf02d T ')2\n\n(5)\n\n\uf03d\n\n4e2 kFW ' T '2 .\nh \uf070 (2 \uf02d T ')2\n\n(6)\n\nand\nGSN (2 D) \uf03d 1\n\nRSN (2 D)\n\nThe primes in Eqs. 5 and 6 indicate possible\nchanges of the contact parameters caused by the\ntransition to the superconducting phase. We point out\n\n2\n\n\fthat it has been assumed A = A', W = W,' and T = T' for\nmost of S/Sm contacts studied so far. It is easy to note\nfrom Eqs. 3-6 that if this is the case, the contact\nconductance GNN/GSN, increases at most by a factor of two\nbelow the superconducting transition. This occurs for T =\nT' = 1. Actually, the value of GNN/GSN monotonically\ndecreases when the magnitude of T gets reduced\nbecoming smaller than one for T < 0.76. This is a\nconsequence of the fact that due to the presence of the\nsuperconducting energy gap, no one-carrier transport is\npossible across any S/Sm interface. Simultaneously, the\ntwo-carrier subgap transport via the Andreev reflection,\nwhich is proportional to \uf07e T2, becomes strongly reduced\nwhen the transmission magnitude is suppressed.\nThis theory applies to the ballistic regime where the\nelectron mean free path le is much larger than the\ncharacteristic contact dimensions, le >> W, A. When this\ncondition is not fulfilled, the contact resistance also\ncontains a contribution from diffusive transport.\nHowever, as shown by Wexler16 and de Jong17 for the 3D\nand 2D contacts respectively, the diffusion gives an\nadditive contribution to the contact resistance in the\nwhole range of le values, from le >> W, A to le << W, A.\nSince often le \uf07e W, A, in order to extract the ballistic\ncontribution from experimental data, the diffusive part\nshould be independently determined and subtracted\nfrom the total contact resistance.\nAt an ideal S/Sm interface, T = 1, the efficiency of the\nAndreev reflection reaches 100%. Furthermore, for an\nideal contact the current across the interface is rather\ndistributed uniformly than exhibits a filamentary\ncharacter, so that the effective contact width W (the 2D\ncase) or the contact area A (the 3D case) are equal to\nthose implied by the fabrication process, W = Wg, and A =\nAg, respectively. We will denote the contact resistances\n\u2217\ncalculated using Eqs. 3-6 for the ideal parameters as RNN\n\u2217\nand RSN . Any real S/Sm structure can be, therefore,\ncharacterized by comparing the magnitude of its\n\u2217\n\u2217\nresistance to RNN\nandRSN\n.\nS/Sm structures close to the ideal limit have been\nonly obtained for InAs and related materials.18 This is\ndue to the fact that there is no Schottky barrier in this\ncase, and the interface is abrupt and spatially uniform. 5\nIn other S/Sm junctions where Schottky barriers are\npresent, ohmic contacts can be obtained by alloying.19\nTypically, one (or more) metals are deposited onto the\nsemiconductor surface and annealed in order to promote\nan interdiffusion process. As a result, the metal\npenetrates and dopes the semiconductor, and/or various\ninterfacial reactions take place. In this way, metallic\nconductance is established. However, a random\ncharacter of the process results in a filamentary\ncharacter of the charge transport, so that usually\nW << Wg or A << Ag. Consequently, the values of contact\n\u2217\n\u2217\nresistances are much higher than RNN\nand RSN\n. The bestknown example is the AuGe/Ni alloyed contact,\ncommonly used for AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures.20 It\nhas to be noted that in devices like quantum wires or\nquantum dots, the contact pads are placed at\n\nmacroscopic distances from the active device regions.\nTherefore, their inhomogeneity does not play any role\nand a large contact pad area compensates the enhanced\ncontact resistance. In contrast, in the case of hybrid S/Sm\nmicrodevices, the inhomogeneity is unacceptable\nbecause the contact is an essential part of the active\ndevice. This is the reason that superconducting contacts\nto AlGaAs/GaAs could not be obtained with a quality\nappropriate for useful S/Sm devices. In particular,\nattempts of alloying AlGaAs/GaAs with indium21,22 or\ntin23 led to rather inhomogeneous interfaces, as\ndemonstrated by using high-resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy (HRTEM), which revealed a number\nof pyramid-like filaments penetrating the AlGaAs barrier\nbetween the In layer and the 2D electron gas.22 This\nnanocomposite-like\nstructure\nenabled\nmetallic\nconductance across the AlGaAs cap layer, however, the\n\u2217\n\u2217\ncontact resistance was much higher than RNN\nand RSN\n. In\na more recent work,24 indium contacts were prepared to\nGaAs/GaAlAs by employing an improved fabrication\nprocedure. Also in this case, the contact resistance was\nmuch higher than the ideal values, and there was clear\nevidence that the current flew through a number of\nseparate In filaments. This indicated that W << Wg.\nAdditionally, the resistance was higher when In was\nsuperconducting than when it was in the normal state. In\nterms of Eqs. 4 and 6, this indicated that the\ntransmission coefficient did not exceed 0.76. A similar\nbehavior was also reported for many other S/Sm\nstructures.25\nThese observations confirm that the theory of\nBeenakker14 properly describes the existing S/Sm\njunctions provided that one takes into account the real\ncontact width or area. It might appear that this approach\ncan be also applied to the case of the In/PbTe contacts.\nHowever, our findings demonstrate that a dramatic\nincrease in the values of W and A occurs at the\nsuperconducting transition. We link these results to\nunusual properties of In/PbTe interfaces, which are\ndescribed in the next Section.\n\n3. In/PbTe contacts: Present status\nAs it was mentioned before, there is a tendency in ntype PbTe to form a depletion layer at the surface. This is\na result of oxidation under ambient conditions.26\nMoreover, after a sufficiently long time even p-type\ninversion layers are formed.27 The depletion layer width\nis\n\nwdepl \uf03d\n\n2\uf065\uf065 0 \uf046\n\n,\n(7)\neN\nwhere \uf046 is the surface potential, N the carrier\nconcentration, and \uf065 the relative dielectric constant.\nBecause of a huge value of \uf065 in PbTe, one expects very\nwide depletion layers in this material. For example, in\nbulk PbTe samples measured in the present work, one\nobtains wdepl = 270 nm, assuming that \uf046 is equal to the\nvalue of the energy gap. The actual magnitude of the\n\n3\n\n\fbarrier is even higher in the case of the Pb0.92Eu0.08Te cap\nlayer on the PbTe QWs studied in the present paper.\nTherefore, obtaining of an ohmic contact to n-PbTe is\npossible only by an appropriate alloying.\nFor this purpose, we have used In. According to the\navailable data, In forms a resonant donor in PbTe. 10\nHowever, the electron concentration in PbTe doped with\nIn never exceeds 1019 cm-3. This was explained in terms\nof Fermi level pinning at this resonant level, which is\nplaced about 70 meV above conduction band edge. Also\nimportant is the fact that the solubility of In in PbTe\nreaches 24%28 so quite concentrated alloys can be\nformed. Furthermore, for In concentrations exceeding\n2% the resonant level starts to shift down towards the\nband edge and finally enters the energy gap above 20 %.\nThis transition is marked by an increase of the alloy\nresistance by several orders of magnitude.28 For even\nhigher In concentrations, the solid solution becomes a\nheterogeneous mixture of PbTe and indium tellurides,\nnamely, InTe and In2Te3.29 These compounds are known\nas wide the band gap semiconductors or insulators.30\nThe above findings indicate that very strong alloying of\nPbTe by In leads to an insulating, rather than metallic,\nbehavior.\nWhat should be noted as well is the fact that the\nIn/PbTe alloying process may occur already at room\ntemperature. This was unambiguously shown in studies\nof the structure of In/PbTe contacts performed by Auger\nspectroscopy profiling.31,32 For example, a significant In\ncontent was found as deep as several tenths of nm below\nthe PbTe surface, for a contact deposited at T = 80 K and\nheated up to 300 K for the period of 1 h only. 31 Probably,\nthis process is responsible for the fact that In is\ncommonly used for making low-resistance contacts to ntype PbTe.9 However, because of the complicated\nbehavior of the In/PbTe alloy, the contact structure is\nrather complex and poorly understood. In particular, the\nfast diffusion rate at room temperature seems to be\ninconsistent with the known rates for In diffusion\nobserved during the fabrication of PbTe p-n junctions.33\nThese rates were measured in the temperature range\nfrom 600\uf0b0C to 1000\uf0b0C, and their extrapolation to room\ntemperature leads to negligible diffusion. Such a\ndiscrepancy indicates that the mechanisms of In\ndiffusion at small (doping regime) and high (alloy\nregime) concentrations must be different. This problem\nwas considered by Smorodina et al.,34 who measured\nAuger spectra of In impurities in PbTe. They found that\nfor small concentrations (x << 1%) the bond In-Te had\nan octahedral character. This meant that In acted as an\nimpurity substituting Pb. However, for x > 1%, In-Te\nformed predominantly covalent bonds, which was\ncharacteristic for indium tellurides. Indeed, measured\nAuger profiles revealed the presence of these\ncompounds in In/PbTe contacts.31,32 According to the\npredictions of Sizov et al.,35 the formation of In-tellurides\nis energetically favorable and might even occur at room\ntemperature. Grishina et al.,32 have proposed that such\ninterfacial reactions may be like:\n\nIn + PbTe \uf0ae InTe + Pb + 45.68 kJ.\nIt is strongly exothermic and can also produce Pb\nprecipitates in the contact region. The last observation is\nimportant for the explanation of our experimental\nresults.\nAnother observation, also important from the point\nof view of the present work, is the surprising number of\nsuperconducting phases reported for PbTe. Several\nauthors interpreted these phases as arising from either\nPb precipitation,36,37 indium diffusion,38 dislocation\narrays 39,40 or caused by thallium (in p-type material).41\nAs we discuss in Section 6, the tendency of PbTe to\nsuperconduct may be not accidental and could be a\nconsequence of its unusual material properties. It is\ninteresting to recall here the only existing (at least in our\nknowledge) study of the superconducting In layers\ndeposited on PbTe crystals.38 In contrast to our layers,\nthese were deposited in ultra-high vacuum on the\nsubstrates cooled down to helium temperatures with\nthicknesses of the order of 10 nm. Their resistance was\nmeasured in-situ and exhibited a superconducting\ntransition Tc at about 7 K. This value is substantially\nhigher than for the bulk indium (Tc = 3.4 K). Additionally,\nthe properties of the In layers visibly changed after even\nvery short warming up to the room temperature. There\nwere no structural studies, however, one could suppose\nthat because of their small thickness the In layers were\ndiscontinuous and consisted of separate grains.\nTherefore, the measured resistance could contain a\ncontribution from the In/PbTe interface region. Later on,\nthe same authors42 suggested that the increase of Tc\ncould be caused by an unknown superconducting phase\narising due to alloying. A quite similar increase of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature has been\nobserved in the In/PbTe contacts studied in the present\nwork.\n\n4. Experimental details\n4.1 Starting materials: bulk crystals and quantum\nwells\nBulk PbTe samples for the contact studies have been\ncut from a crystal grown by the Bridgman method. The\nelectric parameters for this crystal are shown in Table 1.\nThe n-type conductivity is assigned to an excess of Pb. A\nrather high value of electron mobility is a result of the\nlow effective mass and the huge dielectric constant of\nPbTe. For contact resistance measurements, rectangular\nsamples of dimensions 8 \uf0b42\uf0b41.5 mm3 have been\nprepared. Their surfaces have been mechanically\npolished and etched in HBr solution. The contacts are\nusually deposited one day after the etching process, in\nthe meantime the samples are kept in ambient\natmosphere.\n\n4\n\n\f4.2 Fabrication of In/PbTe contacts\nIn order to fabricate In/PbTe contacts different\nprocedures have been employed for the bulk and QW\nsamples. For bulk PbTe, pressed, evaporated, and\nsoldered contacts have been studied. They are\nschematically represented in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b). A\nmacroscopic In wire has been pressed towards the\nsample edge and fixed in a way that the thermal\ncompression during the cooling increased the pressing\nforce. Although the resistance of this contact exhibited\ndifferent values during subsequent cooling cycles, the\nqualitative behavior is reproducible. The evaporated\ncontact [Fig. 1(b)] has been defined by thermal\ndeposition of 5N metallic In using a standard thermal\nevaporator. To define the contact shape, a macroscopic\nmetallic mask is used. The vacuum during the\nevaporation is about 10-6 Torr and the substrate is kept\nat the room temperature. The deposition time is always\nshorter than 40 seconds to prevent any overheating of\nthe structure. The In layer thickness is controlled during\nthe process by a quartz resonator and in most cases is\nequal to 150 nm. In order to contact the layer to the\nmeasuring circuit, a small In piece is fixed by pressing,\navoiding a direct heating of the evaporated layer. In\ncontrast, the formation of soldered contacts involve such\nheating up to about 150-200\uf0b0C. This type of contacts is\nfabricated by positioning small In spots on the sample\nsurface wetted by tiny amount of milk acid. Additionally,\nto determine the bulk contribution, four contacts are\nsoldered to a rectangular sample to enable four-probe\nresistance measurements. It has to be noted that only for\nthe evaporated contact, the geometrical dimensions are\nknown accurately. For the soldered spots these can only\nbe crudely estimated and are virtually unknown for the\npressed contacts\n\nFig. 2 (a) Layout of modulation doped PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi\nherostructure. The evaporated In layer deposited on uncovered\nquantum well is also shown. (b) AFM surface profile across such a\nstructure (gray band schematically indicates the position of the PbTe\nquantum well).\n\nA layout of modulation doped PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi\nheterostructures is presented schematically in Fig. 2(a).\nThe structures have been fabricated by molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE) employing protocols described\npreviously.43 The layers are deposited on (111) oriented\nBaF2 substrates. A thick Pb0.92Eu0.08Te buffer layer\nseparates the active PbTe QW from the heavily\ndislocated p-type layer that is formed at the substrate\nvicinity.44 The PbTe QW resides between the\nPb0.92Eu0.08Te barriers. For the employed Eu content of\n8%, the barrier height in the conduction band is close to\n180 meV.45 In order to avoid precipitation of Eu, the MBE\ngrowth is performed with some excess of Te flux, so that\nthe undoped QW exhibits weak p-type conductivity.\nThus, to introduce electrons into the QW, a part of the\nfront PbEuTe barrier is doped by Bi (ND = 3*1018 cm\u22123).\nThe doped layer is separated from the PbTe QW by an\nundoped 2 nm thick Pb0.92Eu0.08Te spacer layer. A 90 nm\nthick Pb0.92Eu0.08Te cap layer completes the structure. In\nthe employed layout, the n-type QW is electrically\nseparated from the interfacial defects by the p-n\njunction. Actually, biasing of this junction can serve for\nchanging the electron concentration in the QW. This\nmethod was previously used for tuning the electron\ndensity in quantum ballistic devices of PbTe.12\nBasic electrical parameters of the studied QWs are\nshown in Table 1. As one can see, the electron mobility\nvalues are by about an order of magnitude smaller than\nin the bulk sample. As demonstrated in our previous\nwork,12 this results from alloy scattering of electrons\npenetrating the Pb1-xEuxTe barriers.\n\nFig. 3 SIMS analysis of the concentration profile of Eu, Pb, Te, In and Bi\nfor one of the PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi heterostructures containing a\n35 nm wide PbTe quantum well. Open symbols \u2013 data taken prior to In\ndeposition. Closed symbols - after In deposition and subsequent\ndissolving of the In layer in concentrated HCl.\n\nS/Sm structures of PbTe QWs are patterned by\nelectron beam lithography, which allows precise\ndefinition of the contact dimension and shape. For such\nhybrid structures, two lithographic steps are necessary.\n\n5\n\n\fIn the first step, insulating trenches (2 \uf06dm wide and 0.7\n\uf06dm deep) are defined and etched down by means of a\n0.05% Br solution in ethylene glycol. In this way, the\nconducting paths in PbTe QWs are defined. In the second\nstep, the In electrodes are patterned and thermally\nevaporated. For this purpose, we use the same apparatus\nas for the contacts to the bulk PbTe. The lift-off process is\nemployed to finally define the metal electrodes. An\nimportant point is the proper control of the vertical\njunction geometry because it determines the contact\nbetween the In layer and the underlying QW. We employ\ntwo possible configurations. In the first one, In is\nevaporated directly on the top of the cap layer, so that\nthe superconducting electrode is separated from the QW\nby a 90 nm thick and 180 meV high Pb0.92Eu0.08Te\nbarrier. In the second one, the Pb0.92Eu0.08Te cap layer is\nremoved by etching and evaporated In on the uncapped\nPbTe QW. In this case, one expects the presence of a\ndepletion layer due to PbTe oxidation and due to the\nremoval of the Bi-doping layer. In Fig. 2(b), we show an\natomic force microscopy surface profile of such a\ncontact. It has to be noted that the In layers show a\npronounced granular structure, characteristic for metals\nevaporated on uncooled substrates.47 Because of that,\ntheir specific resistivity at room temperature is several\ntimes larger than the standard textbook value for bulk In\n(8.5\uf0b410-8 \uf057m). Their superconducting properties have\nbeen checked in separate measurements (see next\nSection). It should be stressed that the samples are kept\nat the room temperature, and the only short-time\nunintentional heating could take place during the\nsoldering process.\nFor our S/Sm structures we use two basic contact\ngeometries. The first of them is a single constriction\nillustrated in Fig. 1(c) with the In layer placed at one\nside. In this case the In layer is deposited onto the\nuncapped QW. A scanning electron microscope (SEM)\nimage of the other type of the structures is shown in Fig.\n1(d). They consist of a PbTe wire and two In electrodes\ndeposited on top of the cap layer. The electrodes are\nseparated from each other by a distance L of several \uf06dm.\nIn the present work, we consider only single S/Sm\ninterfaces, and, accordingly, L is sufficiently large to\nexclude a Josephson coupling between them. During\nthese studies we have fabricated about 40 structures. In\nTable 1 we show detailed parameters for several\nrepresentative examples, for which the experimental\ndata are discussed.\nFinally, in order to study the magnetic susceptibility\narising from the interface region, we have fabricated\n\n2 \uf0b4 2 millimeter arrays of 10 \uf06dm \uf0b4 6 \uf06dm In rectangles\ndeposited on top of the PbTe QWs. The distance between\nneighboring rectangles is 4 \uf06dm. They are evaporated into\npre-etched trenches, in the same way as the structures\nfor transport measurements. In this way, the contact\narea is \"multiplied\" to produce a measurable signal. A\nfragment of the array is shown as an inset to Fig. 8.\nElectrical parameters of the PbTe QW used for this\nstructure are shown in lowest row of Table I.\n\nFig. 4 Plain view SEM image of the PbTe surface after deposition of the\nIn layer and its subsequent dissolution in concentrated HCl (upper\npart). The lower part shows the sample surface without In deposition\nbut treated by HCl.\n\nIn order to determine the resistance of the In/PbTe\ninterface, four probe method has been applied using two\nseparate In soldered contacts attached at each side (see\nFig. 1). In this way contributions from the connecting\nwires as well as the wire contacts are eliminated.\nHowever, for precise determination of the interface\nresistance, one also has to subtract the serial resistance\ncontributions of either the In electrode or the\nintermediate semiconductor material. They have been\nindependently measured by using reference structures\nof the same geometry. For the determination of the In\nlayer resistance the surface of the structure is fully\ncovered by In, and for the determination of the\nsemiconductor contribution a sample without deposited\nIn is employed. We have also prepared several\nstructures where In has been substituted by Pb. Because\nPb does not alloy with PbTe, this has been used to\ndemonstrate the presence of the barrier on the surface of\nthis material. Additionally, to check the resistance of the\nundoped QW, we have prepared one structure with\nremoved both the cap and Bi-doped layers, but without\nIn deposition. The geometry of all the reference\nstructures is schematically presented in insets to Fig. 5\nand 6.\n\n6\n\n\fTable 1. Summary of In/PbTe hybrid structure parameters and the interface resistance drop between T = 7 K and T = 1.9 K. In the last columns, the\nvalues of the transmission coefficient in the superconducting state T' determined from the experimental data are shown in brackets. Notations: n\nelectron concentration, \uf06d - mobility (le electron mean free path), Wg \u2013 2D apparent contact width, Ag- 3D apparent contact area, Rnor \u2013 measured\n\u2217\n\u2217\ninterface resistance in the normal state and Rsup \u2013 measured interface resistance in the superconducting state. RNN\nandRSN\nare interface resistances\nfor ideal S/Sm contacts, in normal and superconducting state, calculated from Eqs. 3-6.\n\nThe contact resistance measurements as a\nfunction of temperature have been performed using\neither a He4-vapor cooled variable temperature insert or\na plastic He3/He4 dilution refrigerator, both immersed in\na standard helium cryostat equipped with a\nsuperconducting coil capable of producing fields up to 9\nT. Lock-in technique with frequency 18.6 Hz is employed\nfor the resistance measurements. In the present work,\nonly the linear transport regime is studied. For this\nreason, the sample currents are kept in the nanoampere\nrange and the measured voltages are smaller than 50 \uf06dV.\nThe measurements of ac-magnetic susceptibility are\nperformed in the temperature range 2 - 10 K by using\nthe in-plane magnetic field of the amplitude of 0.1 - 10Oe\nand frequency of 100 Hz - 10 kHz We have found that the\nobtained results are independent of the magnitude and\nfrequency of the ac field in this range.\n\nFig. 2(a)]. In particular, one can recognize the position of\nthe Bi-doped layer and of the PbTe quantum well\n(indicated by arrows). Unexpectedly, the initial layers\nalso contain a not negligible amount of indium. Most\nprobably, this is a result of unintentional incorporation\nin the MBE chamber, where the BaF 2 substrate is fixed\nusing this metal to the substrate heater.48 For this\nreason, we have performed additional tests to check\nwhether or not this initial amount of indium causes any\nunintentional superconductivity.49 However, neither the\nmagnetic susceptibility (see Fig. 8) nor the transport\ndata showed any traces of superconductivity in the\ninitial layers. It is important to note here that the bulk\nPbTe crystals does not contain any initial In content\nbecause they are grown using a completely different\nmethod.\nA SIMS analysis of the sample with the deposited In\nlayer represented by full symbols in Fig. 3. In this case,\nthe In layer has been dissolved in concentrated HCl prior\nto the analysis. Otherwise, the temperature increase\ncaused by the incident ion beam melts indium and floods\nthe analyzed area. Since immersing in HCl has only\nminor effect on the surface morphology and the\nelectrical properties of the PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te layers,\none may expect that such procedure does not influence\nthe contact structure. As one can see from Fig. 3, there is\nonly a moderate increase of the In concentration after\nthis process. However, a more pronounced effect is the\nincrease of the lead concentration near the surface. This\nmay be a result of the interfacial reactions considered in\nthe Sec. 3.\n\n5. Experimental Results\n5.1 Structural properties of In/PbTe contacts\n\nIn order to confirm that an alloying process occurred\nin our structures, we have examined the compositional\nprofile by means of secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n(SIMS). Oxygen ions have been employed as the primary\nbeam. Primary ions energy is set to 12.5 keV with the\nbeam current keep at 60nA. The secondary ions are\ncollected from a central region of 60 \uf06dm in a diameter.\nFigure 3 shows a representative result obtained for the\nPbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te layer no. 1703. This is the same\nlayer for which magnetic susceptibility has been studied,\nsee Table 1. The data reflect the multilayer sequence [see\n\n7\n\n\f5.2. Transport measurements\n\nBefore presentation of the main results on the\ncontact resistance in the S/Sm structures in the\nsuperconducting regime, we show several results of\ntransport measurements performed on reference\nsamples. They show contributions from different\nconstituents of our structures to the measured junction\nresistance and prove the existence of a surface barrier.\nThese results allow us to assign unambiguously the main\neffect to the In/PbTe interface. Figure 5 shows the\nresistance of the continuous In layer as a function of\ntemperature (curve 1 - lower axis) and magnetic field\n(curve 2 -upper axis), for the reference constriction of\nthe geometry as seen in Fig. 1(c), but fully covered by a\n150 nm thick In layer (see Inset). Apparently, the\nsuperconducting transitions are quite abrupt. There is\nonly a minor broadening and the superconducting\ntransition temperature of Tc \uf0bb 3.9 K, is several tenths of\nKelvin higher than the textbook value for indium (3.4 K).\nAlso, the critical magnetic field is slightly reduced with\nrespect to the bulk In value (29 mT) and only about 90%\nof the normal resistance is restored up to magnetic fields\nof 100 mT. We attribute these anomalies to result from\nthe granularity of the In layer. We have also checked that\nthe superconducting state is preserved at least for the\ncurrents of 1 mA passing through the structure. This\nvalue is much larger than all currents used for the\nmeasurements in this work.\nIn Fig. 6 the resistance of several reference\nstructures of the geometry corresponding to that shown\nin Fig. 1 c, but with different modifications indicated by\nschemes placed at the curves. All data are shown as a\nfunction of temperature in the range from 77 to 300 K, in\nthe form of an Arrhenius plot. Curve 1 represents the\ndata for an empty constriction, patterned in the\nPbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te QW. It shows metallic behavior in\nthe whole temperature range. The maximum near 200 K\nis a result of the buffer layer conduction, which shortcircuits the insulating trenches at higher temperatures. 50\nCurve 2 represents the resistance of the In contact to\nuncovered PbTe QW. Although the resistance is\nincreased with respect to the empty structure, it also\nshows metallic behavior. Curves 1 and 2 are almost\nparallel to each other and their difference is only weakly\ntemperature dependent. Curve 3 represents the\nresistance of the structure with removed cap and Bidoped layer on one side of the constriction. The\nresistance exhibits insulating behavior at low\ntemperatures. In particular, its increase is approximately\nexponential, with an activation energy Ea \uf0bb100 meV,\nwhich is nearly half of the energy gap in PbTe. Finally,\ncurve 4 shows the resistance of a structure where In has\nbeen replaced by Pb. Quite surprisingly, there is also\ninsulating behavior visible, and the resistance increases\nalmost in parallel to that observed in the previous\nstructure. The above results confirm the existence of a\ndepletion layer at the uncovered surface of the PbTe QW.\nThis barrier is removed by deposition of In, because this\nmetal is able to alloy with PbTe, whereas alloying does\n\nFig. 5. Resistance as a function of temperature (curve 1 - lower scale)\nand magnetic field (curve 2 - upper scale) for the 30 \uf06dm wide\nconstriction patterned in a PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi heterostructure\nand fully covered by a 150 nm thick In layer. This is the reference\nstructure for the one presented in Fig. 1(c).\n\nFig. 6. Resistance as a function of the inverse temperature for the S/Sm\nstructure presented in Fig. 1(c), compared to results obtained for\nseveral reference structures. Curve 1: constriction patterned of the\nPbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi heterostructure. Curve 2: In/PbTe junction\ncontaining the In layer deposited on top of the uncovered PbTe\nquantum well on one side of the contact [see no.1695 in Table I and Fig.\n2(b)]. Curve 3: empty constriction with uncovered PbTe quantum well\non one side and without the In layer. Curve 4: Pb layer (instead of In)\ndeposited on top of the PbTe quantum well (MBEG 481 in Table I).\n\nIt has to be noted that because the SIMS analysis\naverages the signal over an area with a diameter of about\n60 \uf06dm, one cannot resolve whether In and Pb is\ndistributed uniformly or whether these metals form tiny\ninclusions. We have performed investigations of the\nsample surface after dissolution of the In layer in HCl,\nusing field emission scanning electron microscope. An\nexample image obtained for an array of In rectangles\n(sample 1703 \u2013 see Table 1) is represented in Fig. 4. One\nnotices the distinct difference between the unperturbed\nPbTe surface and the one previously covered by In.\nWhile the former is very smooth, the latter shows a\nporous structure. There are numerous holes of\ndimensions up to several tenths nm, indicating that HCl\netching rate has been very fast in these regions. The\nholes are surrounded by the regions much more\nresistive to the acid. Such picture indicates a chemical\ndisorder of the surface, which implies inhomogeneity of\nthe electrical properties of the In/PbTe interface. This\nobservation is in agreement with the established picture\nfor alloyed contacts.\n\n8\n\n\fnot take place in the case of Pb. This is also confirmed for\nsamples with Pb deposited on the cap layer of\nPbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te QWs.\n\nseries resistance of contact pads and the diffusive\ntransport in the intermediate semiconductor material.\nThe best way to proceed is to use the reference data for\nempty structures. We illustrate the procedure for the\nsingle S/Sm constriction whose resistance is shown in\nFig. 7(c). As one can see, its resistance drops from R1 =\n229 \uf057 at T = 7 K to R2 = 19 \uf057 at 100 mK (curve 1).\nSimultaneously, the resistance of the reference\nconstriction without In monotonically decreases from 16\nto 13 \uf057 (curve 2). It contains two contributions (in\nseries) of the large connecting pads and the constriction\nresistance. As was mentioned in Section 2, the latter may\nbe approximated by a sum of diffusive and the ballistic\nparts. For a constriction of the width Wg = 30 \uf06dm, and the\nparameters of the layer (MBEG 1695), Eq. 4 gives a\n*\nballistic contribution RNN\n= 0.96 \uf057. Then the contact\npad and diffusive resistances sum up to a value of about\n12 \uf057. Because for the S/Sm structure half of the\nconstriction is covered by the In layer of negligible\nresistance, for the second half we adopt the value of 6 \uf057.\nWhen one subtracts this value from the measured\nmagnitudes of R1 and R2 , the interface resistances are\nRnor =221 \uf057 and Rsup =13 \uf057 for the normal and the\nsuperconducting states of the In electrode, respectively.\nThe determination of Rnor and Rsup for the structure with\ndouble S/Sm junction [Fig. 1(d)] is even more simple.\nBecause the contact pads in this case are covered by an\nIn layer and their contribution to resistance is negligible,\none has only to subtract the diffusive resistance of the\nSm wire placed between the two S/Sm interfaces. Less\naccurate is determination of Rnor and Rsup for In contacts\nto bulk PbTe because their geometry is less precisely\ndefined. In this case, we have subtracted the bulk\ncontribution, which has been independently determined\nby the four-probe method. The values of Rnor measured at\n7 K, and Rsup measured at 1.8 K are listed in in Table 1. It\nhas to be noted that a quantitative analysis is not\npossible for the pressed contact because of its unknown\ndimensions.\nIn order to compare the results to the ideal contact\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nresistances RNN\nandRSN\n, the calculated ratios RNN\n/Rnor\n\u2217\nand RSN /Rsup are listed in Table 1. It has to be\n\u2217\nremembered that RSN\nalready contains the factor of two\ndue to the Andreev reflection. Then for the ideal contact\n\u2217\n\u2217\none expects RNN\n/Rnor = RSN\n/Rsup = 1. However, for a\n\u2217\n\u2217\nnon-ideal contact, one has always RNN\n/Rnor >RSN\n/Rsup .\nThe fact that we observe, as listed in Tab. 1, the opposite\ninequality indicates that the resistance values are\nmodified by the interface superconductivity. In terms of\nEqs. 3-6, we may assume that either the real contact\ndimensions (W in 2D case or A in the 3D case) or the\ntransmission coefficients T are enhanced. Let us consider\nthis conjecture, for example, for the 2D contacts. There\nare two limiting cases:\n1) If one assumes T = T' =1, then the numbers in\ncolumns 7th and 9th represent relative contact widths\n\u2217\n\u2217\nW/WG = RNN\n/Rnor\nand W\u2032/WG = RSN\n/Rsup . The\nresistance drop at the superconducting transition is\n\nFig. 7.

The first step starts to appear in\nthe temperature range between 6 and 7 K, while the\nsecond one becomes apparent between 3 and 4 K. The\nlatter corresponds quite well to the superconducting\ntransition in the In layer. Importantly, the magnitude of\nthe step is much larger than the resistance of the In\nelectrode (see Fig. 5) in its normal state, indicating that\nthis result cannot simply be explained as originating\nfrom the vanishing of the In resistance below Tc.\nBecause the observed resistance drops are very\ndissimilar to those occurring in pure In, we conclude that\nthey have to be assigned to the interface region between\nIn and PbTe. The main effect of this \"interface\nsuperconductivity\" is a substantial reduction of the\ncontact resistance. We describe it quantitatively in terms\nof Eq. 3-6. To employ the theoretical expressions we\nneed to extract the interface resistance from the\nmeasured values that contain contributions from the\n\n9\n\n\fexclusively caused by an increase from W to W'.\nTherefore, W and W' are lower bounds of the real contact\nwidths in the normal and superconducting state,\nrespectively. 2) If one assumes that W = W'= Wg, the\nresistance drop is caused exclusively by an increase of\nthe transmission from T to T'. For the normal state one\n\u2217\nnow\nhas\nT = RNN\n/Rnor ,\nhowever,\nfor\nthe\nsuperconducting state, Eq. 6 yields T \u2032 = 2q/(1 + q) ,\n\u2217\nwhere q = RSN\n/Rsup . The values of T' determined\nunder assumption 2) are shown in brackets in column 9.\nIn this case, T and T' are lower bounds for the\ntransmissions of the S/Sm contacts. The same reasoning\nholds for 3D-contacts, the only change is substituting W\nand W' by the effective contact areas, A and A'.\n\u2217\nCharacteristically, the values of RNN\n/Rnor for the\ncontacts fabricated of the bulk PbTe and to the uncapped\nQWs (no. 1695) are much smaller than those with In\ndeposited on the Pb0.92Eu0.08Te cap layer. The latter is\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than the former. This\nconfirms the fact that the depletion layer which exists on\nthe bare PbTe surface produces a wider barrier.\nHowever, in the superconducting state, the respective\n\u2217\ndifferences between the values of RSN\n/Rsup become\nsignificantly smaller. Furthermore, the transmissions T'\nare similar for all structures.\nIt has to be stressed that despite the calculated\nvalues of T' are the lower bounds for the transmission in\nthe superconducting state, they are already in the range\nfrom 0.1 to 1. This means that they compete with the\nbest transmission values reported for other S/Sm\nsystems.5 Furthermore, if one assumes that W' < Wg\n(A' < Ag), they must be even higher. At the lowest\npossible W' (or A') set by the upper numbers in 9th\n\u2217\ncolumn of Tab. 1, W\u2032/WG = RSN\n/Rsup , one has to assume\nT' = 1. Therefore, the superconducting transition\noccurring in the interface region would produce contacts\nof an exceptional quality.\n\n7.5 K. On the contrary, no anomalies are observed for the\nempty QW, i.e., not covered by In, which confirms that it\ndoes not contain any superconducting phases.\n\nFig. 8. Real part of ac magnetic susceptibility measured on a large array\nof 6\uf0b410 \uf06dm2 In rectangles deposited on uncovered, 35 nm wide PbTe\nquantum well in PbTe/Pb0.92Eu0.08Te:Bi heterostructures (MBEG\n1703, see Table I). The susceptibility of the unprocessed\nheterostructure is shown for comparison. Inset: SEM image of the In\narray.\n\nOne has to notice that the signal from the indium\nlayer (with the onset expected at about Tc = 3.4 K) is\nquite weak, probably because the layer is thinner than\nthe superconductor penetration length \uf06c. We have also\nchecked that in the perpendicular ac field configuration\nthe diamagnetic contribution from indium becomes very\npronounced, by far exceeding that of the interface\nsuperconducting phases. This is an additional evidence\nthat the In layers preserve their superconducting\nproperties after being patterned into micrometer size\npatches.\n\n6. Discussion\nThe main observations on In/PbTe contacts are as\nfollow. Apparently a large barrier exists at the uncovered\nn-type PbTe surface. According to literature data,26,27 this\nresults from surface oxidation, which causes the carrier\ndepletion. The barrier height is actually greater than that\nformed by the larger-energy gap Pb0.92Eu0.08Te\nsurrounding the QWs whose parameters are known: its\nheight is 150 meV and the thickness is 90 nm. A\ndeposition of metallic Pb leaves the interfacial barrier\nintact. The situation is completely different for metallic\nIn which diffuses into PbTe already at room\ntemperature. Thus, an ohmic contact is formed owing to\nthe In penetration into the barriers, either associated\nwith the Pb0.92Eu0.08Te alloy or the surface oxide.\nThe SIMS data suggest that, apart from the diffusion\nof In, the alloying process causes precipitation of pure\nlead or lead rich compounds. Microscopic observations\nof the PbTe surface after dissolving the In layer, suggest\na strongly inhomogeneous contact morphology.\nAccordingly, the results of transport measurements at T\n> 7 K show that the magnitude of the contact resistance\nis significantly larger than that expected in the ideal\n\u2217\nlimit, RNN\n. This indicates that T << 1 and/or W << Wg (in\nthe 2D case), or A << Ag (in the 3D case). Such features\n\n5.3. Magnetic susceptibility measurements\n\nOne important confirmation of the presence of an\ninterface superconducting phase in our S/Sm structures\nis due to magnetic susceptibility measurements. Such\ndata have been obtained for a large array of In rectangles\ndeposited on uncovered PbTe QW (for the initial layer\nparameters, see lowest row in Table 1). Figure 8\nrepresents the results obtained using a parallel ac\nmagnetic field, for the sample with indium rectangles\nand for an empty reference QW. In both cases we\nobserve a continuous decrease of the susceptibility with\nincreasing temperature, proportional to 1/T. It stems\nfrom the paramagnetic contribution of the Eu ions\npresent in the Pb0.92Eu0.08Te barrier, cap and buffer\nlayers. However, two additional jumps arise on this\nbackground for the layer with In rectangles as indicated\nby arrows in Fig. 8. These are interpreted as diamagnetic\ncontributions from superconducting phases formed at\nthe In/PbTe interface. Indeed, they appear at 6 K and 3.5\nK, which agree quite well with the steps in the transport\ndata. There is also a further, much smaller step at about\n\n10\n\n\f7. Conclusions\n\nare well known for alloyed contacts in other\nsemiconductor systems (see Sec. 2).\nThe unexpected result is the strong resistance drop\nin the temperature range below 10 K. We interpret this\neffect in terms of a superconducting transition occurring\nin the interfacial region. In this way, the initial S/Sm\nstructure changes into S/S'/Sm type, i.e., consists of two\nserially connected superconducting regions: the In layer\n- S, and the interface phase - S'. The transition shows an\nonset near T = 7 K, which is significantly above Tc of\nindium. Possibly, this may be connected to the presence\nof additional lead at the interface, as suggested by the\nSIMS data. The most important consequence of the\nformation of the phase S' is the reduction of the contact\nresistance to values close to those expected for an ideal\n\u2217\nAndreev contact, RSN\n. This indicates a substantial\nincrease of the contact transmission and an increase of\nits real width (area). One has to note that even if we\nassume that the contact width (area) is equal to that\ndefined by the fabrication process, the transmission\ncoefficients remain comparable to those observed in the\nbest S/Sm junctions studied up to now. This strongly\nsuggests that the S' phase is homogeneous, in a stark\ncontrast with the known picture of the alloyed contacts\nof other semiconductors, as discussed in Sec. 2.\nThe question arises why in the case of In/PbTe a\nrather homogeneous superconducting phase S' is formed\nin a strongly disordered region. We answer this question\nconsidering a possible interface structure and the unique\nproperties of PbTe. Most probably, the interface region\ncan be treated as consisting of a percolating array of In\nand/or Pb precipitates, randomly distributed within the\ndepleted region of PbTe. It is also possible that some of\npercolating paths are related to structural defects like\ndislocations, which may enhance the diffusion of In. For\nexample, it was established that dislocations enhanced\nthe diffusion rate in the Ti/Al/Mo/Au alloyed contacts to\nAlGaN/GaN heterostructures.51\nRegardless of a microscopic geometry, such arrays\nresemble granular electronic systems,52,53 particularly\nthose consisting of superconducting grains distributed in\na non-superconducting medium. The theories reviewed\nin Ref. 53 predict that a global superconductivity in such\na system is possible due to Cooper pair tunneling\nbetween neighboring grains. Furthermore, it was found\nthat the tunneling is effective only if the Coulomb\ncharging energies of the grains are small comparing to\nthe Josephson coupling energies,54 the role of the\nCoulomb interactions being particularly important if the\nprecipitates are placed in an insulating matrix.55\nBecause of the huge dielectric constant of PbTe at\nlow temperatures (\uf065 > 1000), the Coulomb charging\nenergy of such precipitates is expected to be about two\norders of magnitude smaller than in other systems such\nas GaAs. The reduction of the charging energy enables\nthe development of a global superconductivity for much\nweaker Josephson couplings.\n\nWe have studied the electron transport in\nsuperconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures of\nindium and n-type PbTe, either in the bulk or quantum\nwell form. In this system, metallic contacts are formed by\nspontaneous alloying already at room temperature. The\nmetallic phase penetrates deeply into the semiconductor\nvolume, which allows for the formation of the ohmic\ncontacts even in the presence of a large barrier at the\ninterface. Although the detailed chemical and crystalline\nstructure of the resulting interface alloyed phase\nremains unknown, we have found that it exhibits a broad\nrange of superconducting transitions, occurring in the\ntemperature region between 4 and 7 K. The appearance\nof superconductivity at temperatures above Tc of pure In\nis independent of the junction fabrication procedure and\ncauses a substantial drop in the contact resistance below\n10 K. Actually, the value of the contact resistance\nbecomes comparable to that predicted for an ideal and\nspatially uniform superconductor-normal junction. This\nresult indicates that the superconducting interface phase\nis quite homogeneous - in contrast to expectations for\nalloyed contacts specified by filamentary conductance in\nthe normal state.\nWe put forward a conjecture that the uniform\ninterface superconductivity is a result of the paraelectric\ncharacter of PbTe at helium temperatures. Owing to the\nhuge magnitude of the dielectric constant that reduces\nsignificantly the Coulomb charging energy, the global\nsuperconducting phase spreads over the whole interface\nregion even for rather small magnitudes of the\nJosephson couplings between the superconducting\ngrains involving In and/or Pb . One practical result of our\nwork is that a rather transparent S'/Sm interface is\nobtained with the alloyed contacts, despite of their\nnecessarily inhomogeneous structure.\nPossibly, such a mechanism, together with high\nvalues of electron mobility, may explain the appearance\nof superconductivity in PbTe, as reported by many\nauthors.36-41 This is an interesting possibility because it\npotentially allows tuning the superconducting properties\nwithin a semiconductor, e.g., by changing a distance\nbetween the precipitates. A similar bulk-like\nsuperconductivity induced by precipitates of Hg (or\nperhaps FeSe) was observed in (Hg,Fe)Se.56.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are indebted to Tomasz Story for\nproviding a high-quality n-type PbTe bulk crystal.
