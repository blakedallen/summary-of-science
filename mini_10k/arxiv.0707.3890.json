We show that, at the highest temperatures, the contributions arising from trajectories\nthat wind around the rings and trajectories that do not are governed by two different length scales.\nThis is achieved by analyzing separately the envelope and the oscillating part of the magnetoconduc\u22121/2\ntance. For T & 0.3 K we find Lenv\n\u221d T \u22121/3 for the envelope, and Losc\nfor the oscillations,\n\u03c6\n\u03c6 \u221d T\nin agreement with the prediction for a single ring [1, 2]. This is the first experimental confirmation\nof the geometry dependence of decoherence due to e-e interaction.\nPACS numbers: 73.23.-b ; 73.20.Fz\n\nIn a conductor, quantum electronic interference is limited by phase breaking mechanisms and can only occur below a characteristic scale L\u03c6 , the phase coherence length. Understanding L\u03c6 is a fundamental issue of\nmesoscopic physics. For samples much longer than L\u03c6 ,\nregions of typical size L\u03c6 behave independently causing\ndisorder averaging so that only contributions of reversed\ninterfering electronic trajectories survive. This gives rise\nto a small quantum correction to the average conductance, called the weak localization (WL) correction, suppressed by a magnetic field. Thus the magnetoconductance (MC) is a powerful experimental tool to measure\nL\u03c6 , determine its temperature (T ) dependence and identify the scattering mechanisms responsible for decoherence. For a quasi 1D diffusive wire (of width W \u226a L\u03c6 ),\nthe situation is now well understood theoretically [3] and\nexperimentally [4] : when dephasing is dominated by\nelectron-electron (e-e) interaction, L\u03c6 is well described by\nthe Altshuler-Aronov-Khmelnitskii (AAK) theory yielding L\u03c6 \u221d T \u22121/3 . For a ring threaded by a flux \u03c6, the WL\noscillates as a function of \u03c6 with a period \u03c60 /2 due to interference between trajectories enlacing the ring, where\n\u03c60 = h/e is the flux quantum. These are the AltshulerAronov-Spivak (AAS) oscillations [5]. It was recently\npointed out in [1, 2] that decoherence due to e-e interaction is geometry dependent : AAS oscillations involve a\nlength scale L\u03c6 different from the one of the AAK result\nfor the wire.\nThe difference can be qualitatively understood along\nthe following lines. The WL correction is related to the\nCooperon P(t) which sums the contributions of closed\ninterfering reversed trajectories Ct for a time t. E-e interaction can be described as a fluctuating electromagnetic field which randomizes the phase \u03a6[Ct ] accumulated\nalong Ct . Thus the WL correction to the conductivity can\n\nbe written as\n2e2 D\n\u2206\u03c3 = \u2212\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndt P(t) hei\u03a6[Ct ] iV,Ct\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the average h* * *iV,Ct is taken over the fluctuations of the electric potential V and the closed diffusive trajectories Ct . In order to get a qualitative picture, it is sufficient to consider the fluctuations of the\nphase h\u03a62 iV,Ct , related to the fluctuations of V via\nR\ndh\u03a62 iV\n= d\u03c4 hV (\u03c4 )V (0)iV . The power spectrum of\ndt\nthe\nR t potential is given by2 the Johnson-Nyquist theorem,\n0 hV (\u03c4 )V (0)iV d\u03c4 = 2e T Rt , for the resistance Rt =\nx(t)/(W \u03c30 ) of a wire of length x(t), the typical distance\nexplored by interfering trajectories for a time scale t ; \u03c30\nis the Drude conductivity and W the section of the wires.\nSince the scaling of x(t) with t depends on the diffusion\ndh\u03a62 i\n\n2\n\nV,Ct\ne T\n\u223c W\nand therefore on geometry, from\ndt\n\u03c30 x(t) we\nsee that the decoherence depends on \u221a\ngeometrical properties. For an infinite wire, x(t) \u223c Dt, so that the\nphase fluctuation varies as h\u03a62 iV,Ct \u223c (t/\u03c4N )3/2 [6], with\nNyquist time \u03c4N \u221d T \u22122/3\n\u221a . This well-known result of\nAAK yields L\u03c6 \u223c LN = D\u03c4N \u221d T \u22121/3 [3, 7]. However\nfor a finite wire or for a ring of perimeter L, the length\nx(t) cannot be greater than L at large times, leading\nto fluctuations h\u03a62 iV,Ct \u223c t/\u03c4c\u221awith the new time scale\n\u03c4c \u221d T \u22121 , yielding L\u03c6 \u223c Lc = D\u03c4c \u221d T \u22121/2 [1, 2].\nIn a ring, the WL involves two kinds of trajectories:\nthose which do not enclose the ring whose dephasing is\nexpected to be driven by \u03c4N and those which enclose the\nring and necessarily explore the whole system so that\ntheir dephasing is driven by \u03c4c . In the Fourier series\nof the conductivity, the harmonic n = 0 (smooth part)\ncorresponds to trajectories which do not enlace the ring\nand are only affected by the penetration of the magnetic\nfield in the wires. Therefore we expect the T dependence\n\n\f2\n\u22121/3\nof the envelope to be characterized by Lenv\n, as in\n\u03c6 \u221d T\nan infinite wire. On the other hand, for harmonics n 6= 0,\ntrajectories causing the AAS oscillations encircle at least\nonce the ring. As a consequence\nthe harmonics decay\nosc\nfor L\u03c6 \u226a L, defined as e\u2212nL/L\u03c6 [8], is characterized by\n\u22121/2\nLosc\n[9]. Thus the envelope and the oscillations\n\u03c6 \u221d T\nof the MC are controlled by two different length scales.\nIn this letter, we show how these two length scales can\nbe extracted from the MC of networks fabricated from\na GaAs/AlGaAs 2D electron gas (2DEG). L\u03c6 is determined independently from the harmonics content of the\nenv\nAAS oscillations (Losc\n\u03c6 ) and from the MC envelope (L\u03c6 )\nbetween 25 mK and 750 mK. The main result is that\n\u22121/3\nLosc\nlaw up to 300 mK and a T \u22121/2 law\n\u03c6 follows a T\nabove, whereas Lenv\nfollows a T \u22121/3 law up to 750 mK.\n\u03c6\nThis is the first experimental evidence that in the high T\nregime, Lenv\n\u03c6 /L . 0.3, the phase coherence length follows\na different power law with T for harmonics 0 and 1.\nB (G)\n\n-150\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nT=55mK\n\n3\n\n50\n\nR(k\n\n0\n\n/2\n\n2\n0\n\n-8\n\n48\n\nFFT(10 S)\n\n)\n\n52\n\n1\n\n0\n\n/4\n\n46\n\n0\n\n/6\n\n0\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n0.2\n\n1/B (G )\n\nFIG. 1: Magnetoresistance of network C at 55 mK. Inset :\nFFT of the MC after subtraction of the envelope. The first\npeak corresponds to Aharonov-Bohm oscillations.\n\nMeasurements were performed on two different networks described in [10], and therein denoted sample A\n(with electrostatic gate) and sample C (without). They\nconsist of 106 square loops of side a = 1 \u03bcm for sample A\n(a 1000 \u00d7 1000 grid connected at two opposite corners\nthrough 100 wires) and a = 1.2 \u03bcm for sample C (a rectangular grid of aspect ratio 5 connected at the two narrow\nsides). The nominal width of the wires is W0 = 0.5 \u03bcm.\nWe have measured the MC up to 4.5 T between 25 mK\nand 1.3 K, using a standard lock-in technique (current\nof 1 nA at 30 Hz). The samples were strongly depleted\nat low T because of the etching step used to define the\nnetwork. The intrinsic electron density of the 2DEG,\nne = 4.4 \u00d7 1015 m\u22122 for sample A and 3.8 \u00d7 1015 m\u22122\nfor C, is recovered by illuminating the samples for several minutes at 4.2 K. The density was determined from\n\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations visible above 1T. The carrier mobility was estimated to be \u03bc = 2.2 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 , 10\ntimes smaller than the mobility of the original 2DEG.\nA typical experimental curve is shown in Fig. 1. At\nlow magnetic field, the MC exhibits large AAS oscillations with a period corresponding to \u03c60 /2 per unit cell\n(allowing a precise determination of a). At 55 mK, three\nharmonics are visible in the Fourier spectrum of the MC\n(inset of Fig. 1). The oscillations are damped above 60G,\nbut the field dependence of the envelope, due to the penetration of the magnetic field through the wires, is still\nclearly visible. At high T , the AAS oscillations gradually disappear even at low field and only the positive MC\nremains with a smaller amplitude. The first harmonic is\ndetectable up to 750 mK and the second up to 350 mK.\nIn [10] only the ratio between first and second harmonics was exploited below 350 mK, whereas the present\nwork reports new data in a broader temperature range\nextending into a regime where L\u03c6 \u226a L = 4a. Difficulties arise due to uncertainties in some sample parameters such as the real width W of the wires or the elastic mean free path le . This is why we have developed\nthe following strategy to extract L\u03c6 as a function of T\n(and other parameters) with the least possible parameters. At high T (& 1 K) decoherence is dominated\nby electron-phonon interaction and is well described in\neq. (1) by a simple exponential hei\u03a6[Ct ] iV,Ct = e\u2212t/\u03c4\u03c6\nindependent on trajectories, where \u03c4\u03c6 = L2\u03c6 /D. In\nthis case the theoretical calculation for the WL correction to the conductance of a square network [10, 11]\n\u2206G = C \u2206\u03c3\u0303(L\u03c6 , \u03c6) = C [\u2206\u03c3\u0303env (L\u03c6 ) + \u2206\u03c3\u0303osc (L\u03c6 , \u03c6)]\nperfectly describes the experimental results [11, 12, 13].\n\u03c6 = Ba2 is the flux per cell and \u2206\u03c3\u0303 = W \u2206\u03c3 (so that\n\u2206G and \u2206\u03c3\u0303 do not depend explicitely on W ). \u2206\u03c3\u0303env and\n\u2206\u03c3\u0303osc designate the smooth and oscillating (AAS) parts,\nrespectively. C depends on the network and its connection to contacts (from classical combination of resistances\nin series and in parallel we find that the classical Drude\n0W\nconductance is GD \u2243 \u03c33.5\na for geometry A, therefore\nA\nC \u2243 1/(3.5 a) ; for geometry C we have C C \u2243 1/(5 a)).\nAt low T (. 1 K), decoherence is dominated by e-e interaction and depends on nature of trajectories. Therefore\nwe analyze separately the envelope and oscillating part\nof MC. The envelope calculated with exponential relax2\nation interpolates between \u2206\u03c3\u0303env \u2243 \u2212 2eh L\u03c6 for L\u03c6 \u226a a\n2\nand \u2212 2eh \u03c0a ln(L\u03c6 /a) for L\u03c6 \u226b a, and is not expected to\ndepend much on the precise modelization of decoherence.\nOn the other hand it was shown [10, 13] that the experimental result is perfectly fitted by the MC curve \u2206\u03c3\u0303osc\nwith exponential relaxation. Therefore we analyze the\nexperiment with :\nosc\n\u2206G = C0 \u2206\u03c3\u0303env (Lenv\n\u03c6 ) + C1 \u2206\u03c3\u0303osc (L\u03c6 , \u03c6) .\n\n(2)\n\nTo compare our measurements with the theory (2) we\nenv\nneed 5 parameters: Losc\n\u03c6 , L\u03c6 , W , C0 and C1 . To begin\n\n\f3\nwith, we extract directly Losc\n(without any other ad\u03c6\njustable parameter) below 400 mK using the ratio of the\ntwo first harmonics of the MC [10]. Using this result we\ndetermine the prefactor C1 and eventually extract Losc\n\u03c6\nfrom the amplitude of the first harmonic up to 750 mK.\nThen we can determine the width of the wires from the\nadjustment of the damping of the oscillating part. Finally we obtain Lenv\n\u03c6 and C0 for the whole range of T by\nfitting the MC envelope with only these two parameters.\nAs explained in [10], we extract Losc\n\u03c6 by comparing the\nexperimental MC harmonics [\u2206Gn (T )] to the theoretical harmonics \u2206\u03c3\u0303n (Losc\n\u03c6 ). Experimental Fourier peaks\nare integrated to account for the penetration of the magnetic field in the wires. At low T (. 300 mK), when\nthe second harmonic \u2206G2 is clearly visible, this allows\na direct determination of Losc\n\u03c6 since the harmonics ratio\n\u2206G1\n\u2206\u03c3\u03031\nR12 = \u2206\u03c3\u03032 = \u2206G2 depends only on Losc\n\u03c6 /a. It yields\n\u22120.34\u00b10.02\nLosc\n(T\n)\n\u221d\nT\n(Fig.\n2),\nin\nagreement\nwith [10].\n\u03c6\n\ntion for \u2206\u03c3\u03031 (Losc\n\u03c6 ) between 25 mK and 300 mK (inset of\nFig. 2). This yields C1A \u2243 1/(25a) and C1C \u2243 1/(20a).\nThis plot shows that C1 does not depend on L\u03c6 and consequently on T , which validates our assumption. It is\nnow possible to compare directly the experimental value\nof \u2206G1 (T ) with the theoretical C1 \u2206\u03c3\u03031 (Losc\n\u03c6 ) (inset of\nFig. 2) for the whole T -range where oscillations are visible and reconstruct the curve Losc\n\u03c6 (T ) up to 700 mK. The\nresult (Fig. 2) clearly shows that at high temperature\nLosc\n\u03c6 (T ) is no longer described by the same power law.\n\u22120.53\u00b10.05\nThe fit of the high T data gives Losc\n, very\n\u03c6 \u221dT\n\u22121/2\nclose to the expected T\nfor an individual ring [1, 2].\nIt is interesting that the crossover between the two different power laws occurs for Losc\n\u03c6 /a \u2243 1.2, precisely when\nthe second harmonic becomes unobservable. This is consistent with the fact that the network result coincides\nwith the single ring result only when the probability for\ntrajectories to wind around two cells is negligible [9].\n\nT(K)\n\n0.1\n\n0.03\n\nosc\n\n0.5\n\nL\n\nT=55mK\n\n3\n\n/a=1.9\n\n0.10\n0.34\n\nosc\n\n0.05\n\nosc\n\n-1\n\nL\n\n10\n\n( m)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(e /h)\n\nT\n\n-\n\nT=25 mK\n\n1\n10\n\n~\n\nT=310 mK\n\n0.00\n\n-2\n\na\n\n1\n\ne2\nh\n\nT\n\n-\n\n0.53\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nL\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nosc\n\n/a\n\nFIG. 2: Losc\n\u03c6 (T ) for samples A (squares) and C (circles).\nFilled symbols are obtained from the ratio of the two first harmonics ; open symbols are obtained with only the first harmonic.

As shown on the graph L\u03c6 can be deduced\nfrom the corresponding abscissa on the theoretical curve.\n\nAt higher temperature, \u2206G2 is suppressed and the T\ndependence of Losc\n\u03c6 (T ) can only be extracted from \u2206G1 .\nThis requires the knowledge of C1 , given by \u2206G1 (Losc\n\u03c6 ) =\nosc\nC1 \u2206\u03c3\u03031 (Losc\n).\nBelow\n300\nmK,\nsince\nL\n(T\n)\nand\n\u2206G\n1 (T )\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nare determined, we plot \u2206G1 as a function of Losc\n/a\nand\n\u03c6\nsuperimpose experimental data with theoretical calcula-\n\nFIG. 3: Reconstruction of the damping of the oscillations after\nsubtracting the envelope.

This penetration causes the damping of\nthe oscillations and the external MC envelope. First, we\nextract Weff from the damping of the oscillations. Since\nat large \u03c6, Leff\n\u03c6 is independent on L\u03c6 , this determination\nof Weff is very reliable. For a given Losc\n\u03c6 , we compute the\n\n\f4\n\n5/4\n\n3/2\n\u031f(Lenv\n[1, 2, 8] with \u031f = 2 \u03c0 \u2243 0.75. We\n\u03c6 /a)\n\u22121/3\nhave obtained experimentally Lenv\nand\n\u03c6 /a = 0.81 T\nosc\n\u22121/2\nL\u03c6 /a = 0.62 T\ngiving \u031f \u2243 0.85 close to theory.\nIn conclusion we have shown that decoherence due to\ne-e interaction is geometry dependent. This has been\nrevealed by demonstrating that, in the high T regime\n(Lenv\n\u03c6 /a . 1.2), the envelope of the MC and its oscillating part (AAS) are governed by different length scales\nLenv\n\u221d T \u22120.34\u00b10.02 and Losc\n\u221d T \u22120.53\u00b10.05 . These T \u03c6\n\u03c6\ndependences are close to the expected Lenv\n\u221d T \u22121/3 [3]\n\u03c6\nosc\n\u22121/2\nand L\u03c6 \u221d T\n[1, 2]. Prefactors found in experiment\nare also consistent with theories. We emphasize that it\nhas been possible to use the power law Losc\n\u221d T \u22121/2 ,\n\u03c6\nderived theoretically for a single ring, in the regime\nLenv\n\u03c6 /a \u226a 1 when rings of the network can be considered as independent.

Comparing this curve to\nexperimental data yields Weff = 80 \u00b1 5 nm (Fig. 3). For\nconsistency, we have checked that Weff does not depend\non T from 25 mK to 700 mK.\nWe then extract Lenv\n\u03c6 from the MC envelope by a fitting\nprocedure. The theoretical expression of the envelope\n[10, 11] depends only on Weff , Lenv\nand C0 . Knowing\n\u03c6\nWeff , only two parameters remain, making the fit reliable.\nFitting the experimental MC envelope at each T we get\nC0A \u2243 1/(7 a), C0C \u2243 1/(14 a) and the curve Lenv\n\u03c6 (T )\nplotted in Fig. 4. The fact that C0 does not depend on T\nconfirms the reliability of our method. The curve Lenv\n\u03c6 (T )\n\u22120.34\nyields a power law Lenv\n\u221d\nT\nfor\nthe\nwhole\nT\n-range.\n\u03c6\nFrom Weff , C0 and the measurement of GD =\n2\nC0 eh kF W le \u2243 1/(46 k\u03a9) we obtain le \u2243 310 nm and\nW \u2243 190 nm, which agrees with [10]. The fact that\nwe find C0A \u2243 1/(7 a) and C0C \u2243 1/(14 a), instead of\nthe expected C A \u2243 1/(3.5 a) and C C \u2243 1/(5 a), shows\nthat there probably are a significant number of broken\nwires [10]. This may partly explain the decoupling of the\nenvelope and the oscillating part of the MC (C0 6= C1 ).\nHowever we expect that the broken wires have little effect\non the determination of L\u03c6 since the non trivial shape of\nthe MC is still very well described by the calculation of\n\u2206\u03c3\u0303osc that does not include this effect [17]. In the absence of a full theory for networks including the effect of\ne-e interaction, we based our analysis on the theoretical\nresult (2) for exponential relaxation of phase coherence\ninstead of the single ring result [1, 2]. This emphasizes\nnonlocal properties of quantum transport. However, we\nhave not taken into account the fact that the preexponential factor of harmonics is expected to be proportional\nto Lenv\nand not Losc\n\u03c6\n\u03c6 [2]. This may also partly explain\nthe difference between C0 and C1 .\nWe now discuss the quantitative agreement of Lenv,osc\n\u221a D2 m\u2217 W \u03c61/3\n\u2243\n2( \u03c0kB T )\nwith theories.
