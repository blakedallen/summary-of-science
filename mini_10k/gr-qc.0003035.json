In this paper I will provide physical motivation\nfor the general relativistic analogue of this formula, and thereby arrive at a geometrically\nnatural definition of an 'invariant quasilocal energy', or IQE. In analogy with the invariant\nmass m, the IQE is invariant under local boosts of the fleet of observers on a given twosurface S in spacetime. A reference energy subtraction procedure is required, but in contrast\nto the Brown-York procedure, S is isometrically embedded in a four-dimensional reference\nspacetime of one's choosing. For example, it is well known that any sphere, round or not,\ncan always be isometrically embedded into Minkowski space, even if its scalar curvature\nis not everywhere positive. So rather than embeddability being a concern, the problem\nnow is that such embeddings are not unique, leading to an ambiguity in the reference IQE.\nHowever, in this codimension-two setting there are two curvatures associated with S: the\ncurvature of its tangent bundle, and the curvature of its normal bundle. Taking advantage\nof this fact I will suggest a possible way to resolve the embedding ambiguity, which at the\nsame time will be seen to incorporate angular momentum into the energy at the quasilocal\nlevel. I will analyze the IQE in the following cases: both the spatial and future null infinity\nlimits of a large sphere in asymptotically flat spacetimes; a small sphere shrinking to a\npoint along either spatial or null directions; and finally, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspacetimes. The last case reveals a striking similarity between the reference IQE and a\ncertain counterterm energy recently proposed in the context of the conjectured AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\n1\n\nE-mail address: epp@rri.ernet.in\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is generally agreed that gravitational energy exists, but because of the equivalence\nprinciple it cannot be localized. The notion of quasilocal energy is currently one of the most\npromising descriptions of energy in the context of general relativity, and can be characterized\nsimply as follows. The total energy, including both matter and gravitational contributions,\ncontained in a finite spatial volume \u03a3 can be defined only as the integral of some energy\nsurface density over its two-surface boundary, S = \u2202\u03a3. This implies that, strictly speaking,\nthere is no such thing as a local energy volume density, except that which arises from the\nsmall S limit of quasilocal energy.1 And even this local notion is not truly local because it\ncannot be integrated over a finite volume unless one is willing to ignore effects due to gravity.\nIn short, energy is associated with closed spacelike two-surfaces in spacetime, not points.\nThere is also a growing consensus that the ADM and Bondi-Sachs masses are simply not\nenough. We need some definition of energy that is 'more local' than these, i.e., a quasilocal definition that does not rely on the existence of an asymptotically flat region [2]. For\nexample, recent proponents of this movement are Ashtekar et al [3, 4], who have introduced\nthe quasilocal idea of an 'isolated horizon' to describe a black hole. They articulate several\nreasons for this need, and it is useful to paraphrase here at least part of their argument:\nLet us accept that a black hole is a thermodynamic object, and so obeys the first law:\n\u03b4E = T \u03b4S + * * *. Now suppose that the universe is asymptotically flat in spatial directions,\nand contains a single black hole. Then E in the first law is the ADM mass. But if there is\nanything else in the universe then E is not the ADM mass, and the question arises, What\nexpression is to be used for E in the first law? In other words, we expect that we can put\nsomething else in the universe, say a galaxy somewhere, such that the black hole we started\nwith, considered 'by itself', will still behave as more or less the same thermodynamic object,\nwith the same mass, radiating at the same temperature as before, and with the same entropy\nequal to one quarter its area. This expectation requires the ability to compute the energy of\na given system contained within a finite closed surface, rather than merely the total energy\nof all such systems comprising the whole universe.\nThus quasilocal energy lies between the notions of local energy density and total energy\nof an isolated system, in the sense that it is expected to give the energy contained in any\nvolume, no matter how small or large. Although the equivalence principle precludes the\nexistence of a local gravitational energy density, it does not prevent us from evaluating the\n(quasilocal) gravitational energy in an arbitrarily small but nonvanishing volume \u03a3. This is\nbecause no matter how small \u03a3 is, S = \u2202\u03a3 is not a point, but rather the boundary of some\nneighborhood of a point, and so we are always inherently making a 'tidal force measurement'.\nIn this sense quasilocal energy is distinct from attempts to define a local gravitational energy\ndensity based on certain symmetries of the action, and the concept of a N\u00f6ther charge.2 At\nthe other extreme is the Komar mass (or the closely related ADM mass), i.e., the total\n1\nA notable exception is the Tolman density, which integrates to the Komar mass [1]. But it can be\ndefined only when the spacetime possesses special properties, namely a timelike Killing vector field and an\nasymptotically flat spatial infinity, and so tells us little about the nature of energy in a general context.\n2\nA recent discussion of the connection between pseudotensor methods and the quasilocal idea can be found\nin Ref. [5].\n\n1\n\n\fenergy associated with the time translation symmetry of an isolated system. As emphasized\nin Ref. [6], this gravitational conserved charge is intimately connected with a lapse function,\nwhereas quasilocal energy need not make any reference to a lapse function. The point is,\nthe two are conceptually distinct [2,6], even though in some circumstances one might expect\ntheir numerical values to coincide.\nCurrently there are several contenders for a good definition of quasilocal energy (see\nRefs. [7, 8, 9] and the references therein). The two that interest us at the moment are\nBrown and York's 'canonical quasilocal energy' (or CQE) [7], and the various definitions\nbased on the integral over S of the Witten-Nester two-form (the two-form used in Witten's\nproof of the positive energy theorem [10, 11]). The latter approach uses spinorial methods,\nand the different definitions are distinguished by the choice of supplementary equation the\nS-spinors are supposed to satisfy, for example the Sen-Witten equation [11,12], the DouganMason equation [13], or the Ludvigsen-Vickers equation [14]. The Brown-York definition of\nquasilocal energy has the form3\nCQE = \u2212\n\n1 Z\ndS k \u2212 CQEref ,\n8\u03c0 S\n\n(1.1)\n\nin geometrized units, with G = c = 1. The CQE is supposed to be the energy of the gravitational and matter fields contained in a finite spatial volume \u03a3, whose boundary two-surface\nis S = \u2202\u03a3. dS is the induced integration measure on S, and k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of S as embedded in \u03a3. Thus, \u2212k/(8\u03c0) is the Brown-York quasilocal energy\nsurface density. When \u03a3 is asymptotically flat the integral in Eq. (1.1) (the 'unreferenced'\nCQE) diverges as S is taken to infinity, and a reference term, denoted CQEref , is required\nto regulate the energy. Brown and York's prescription is to choose\nCQE\n\nref\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS k ref ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere k ref is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of an isometric embedding of S into some\nreference space, usually taken to be flat IR3 . With this choice the resulting CQE reduces\nto the ADM mass when S is taken to infinity [7]. While the CQE has a host of desirable\nproperties, neatly summarized in Ref. [15], the embedding prescription needed to evaluate\nCQEref is not entirely satisfactory, because not all two-surfaces that arise in practice can\nbe embedded into flat IR3 . A ready example is the horizon of the Kerr black hole, which\nfails to be embeddable in flat IR3 when the angular momentum exceeds the irreducible mass\n(but is not yet an extremal black hole), and the two-sphere develops regions with negative\nscalar curvature [16]. While this is but one example, it is noteworthy that the breakdown\nof embeddability is in this case associated with angular momentum and negative scalar\ncurvature. It is precisely such issues: embeddability, angular momentum, and negative\nscalar curvature, that will figure prominently in this paper, and will be seen to be subtly\nintertwined.\nAlthough a relationship between the Brown-York quasilocal energy and the spinorial\ndefinitions based on the Witten-Nester integral is not immediately obvious, Lau [15] has\n3\n\nWe use a sign convention for extrinsic curvatures opposite to that of Brown and York, hence the negative\nsign in front of this integral.\n\n2\n\n\fshown that spinors may always be chosen so that the resulting spinorial definition is equal\nto the unreferenced Brown-York quasilocal energy in Eq. (1.1). Moreover, he shows that the\nrole of the Sen-Witten equation is to provide a definite reference point for the energy, which\nis not in general the same as CQEref in Eq. (1.2). The point being made here is two-fold:\n(i) the unreferenced Brown-York quasilocal energy seems to be robust, and (ii) all of the\nproblems lie in choosing a suitable reference energy. The various prescriptions are either not\ngenerally well defined, or they do not agree with each other.\nI will now present a brief review of the Brown-York approach in a form that will be useful\nto us later. The classical energy-momentum tensor of matter is a local concept, associated\nwith a spacetime point. It is defined for any field theory residing on a nondynamical background spacetime (M, g) via the functional derivative of the (first order) matter action with\nrespect to the metric, as follows:\n2 \u03b4g I mat [\u03c6, g] =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u221a\nab\nd4 x \u2212g Tmat\n\u03b4gab .\n\n(1.3)\n\nHere \u03c6 denotes the matter field(s) in question, and the factor of two on the left is a convention. Usually, as we will assume here, there is no boundary term arising from this variation\n(for 'minimally coupled matter'), but in case there is it does not change the essence of the\nab\nfollowing argument, it just adds an interesting dimension to it. Tmat\nso defined is covariantly conserved, as follows from the matter Euler-Lagrange equations. This prescription for\nlearning about matter energy-momentum gives reasonable answers for all field theories, and\nso it is natural to try the same thing for gravity. In this case one finds, for the usual first\norder action [17],\n2 \u03b4g I\n\ngrav\n\n[g] =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd3 x \u2212\u03b3\nd x \u2212g \u2212 Gab \u03b4gab +\n8\u03c0\nB\n4\n\nM\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u2212 \u03a0ab \u03b4\u03b3ab .\n8\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1.4)\n\nab\nInspecting the bulk term one is thus tempted to define Tgrav\n:= \u2212Gab /(8\u03c0) as the local\nab\nenergy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field, where G is the Einstein tensor. And\nthis is perfectly reasonable: it is covariantly conserved-in this case identically so, via the\ncontracted Bianchi identity. Moreover, its on-shell value is zero, in full accord with the\nequivalence principle, i.e., there is no nontrivial local energy-momentum tensor for the gravitational field.\nIn fact this absence of a nontrivial local energy-momentum tensor is true not only for\nthe gravitational field, but also for any system comprised of both matter and gravity. To see\nthis we need only make the spacetime metric dynamical, in which case the matter action in\nEq. (1.3) must be augmented by the gravity action. Adding Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) one finds\nfor the total action\n\n2 \u03b4g I tot [\u03c6, g] =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 ab\n1\nab\nd4 x \u2212g Tmat\n\u2212\n\u03b4gab +\nG\nd3 x \u2212\u03b3 \u2212 \u03a0ab \u03b4\u03b3ab .\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\nB\n\n(1.5)\n\nab\nab\nThus one is led to identify Ttot\n:= Tmat\n\u2212Gab /(8\u03c0) as the total local energy-momentum tensor\nfor matter plus gravity. It has the desirable property of being covariantly conserved, but turns\nout to be just zero by the Einstein equations. If this argument is taken seriously we learn\n\n3\n\n\fthat, as soon as we add gravity to any matter system, the notion of a nontrivial local energymomentum tensor disappears. Furthermore, one might interpret the Einstein equations,\nab\nab\nwritten in the form Tmat\n+ Tgrav\n= 0, as a 'micro-balancing' of local stress-energy-momentum\nat each spacetime point: wherever a component of matter stress-energy-momentum is positive, the corresponding component of gravitational stress-energy-momentum is negative, and\nvice versa, such that the total is always zero. The idea that \u2212Gab /(8\u03c0) is the local energymomentum tensor of gravity is, of course, a very old idea, first put forward by Lorentz and\nLevi-Civita. It was rejected by Einstein, since it implies that the total energy of a closed\nsystem would always be zero, which is obviously problematic.4 It is only with hindsight that\nwe now realize why the problem was not resolved much sooner. People then did not think\nabout boundary terms as much as they do today. Thanks to Brown and York we now know\nthat what comes to the rescue is the boundary term in Eq. (1.5).\nIn this equation the spacetime is assumed to be the topological product of a three-space\n\u03a3 and a real line interval. The boundary component B is a timelike 'tube', topologically\nthe product of S = \u2202\u03a3 and the real line interval. (The two spacelike 'end-cap' boundary components of \u2202M have been omitted, as they play no role in this discussion.) The\n\u221a\nquantity \u2212 \u2212\u03b3 \u03a0ab /(16\u03c0), constructed in the usual way out of the extrinsic curvature of\nB, is the gravitational momentum conjugate to the three-metric \u03b3ab induced on B. Now,\nin the spirit of identifying the energy-momentum tensor as the functional derivative of the\naction with respect to the metric, one reads off from Eq. (1.5) the energy-momentum tensor\nTBab := \u2212\u03a0ab /(8\u03c0), which is inherently associated with the boundary B, rather than the bulk\nspacetime. Like any acceptable energy-momentum tensor, TBab is covariantly conserved (as\na tensor residing in B)-this follows from the analogue of the diffeomorphism constraint of\ngeneral relativity for the three-surface B (rather than \u03a3). Physically, B is to be thought of\nas the congruence of world lines of a two-parameter family of observers with four-velocity\nua , hypersurface orthogonal to a one-parameter foliation of B by spacelike two-surfaces with\nthe topology of S. Within their three-dimensional spacetime (B, \u03b3), the observers measure a\nspatial energy density TBab ua ub , which is precisely \u2212k/(8\u03c0), and thus one is led to Eq. (1.1).\nFinally, observe that one can add to the action any covariant functional of the boundary\nthree-metric \u03b3ab without affecting the previous argument. This is the source of the reference\npoint ambiguity CQEref in Eq. (1.1). This summarizes the central idea of the Brown-York\napproach [7].\nNow if energy is really quasilocal, and calculated via a surface integral involving TBab , one\nab\nab\nnor Tgrav\nhas anything to do with energy!\ncomes to the conclusion that a priori neither Tmat\nWhile this might be unsettling at first, it is reassuring to know that a satisfactory notion of\nlocal matter energy density can be recovered from the small sphere limit of quasilocal energy.\nFor example, in Ref. [19] it is shown that, for a certain choice of reference term CQEref , the\nBrown-York quasilocal energy contained in an infinitesimal sphere of proper radius r is the\nab\nvolume of the sphere (4\u03c0r 3 /3) times the local matter energy density Tmat\nua ub (evaluated\nat the center of the sphere) that would be measured by an observer with four-velocity ua .\nMoreover, this is a well established property of most quasilocal energy definitions [19, 20,\n4\n\nSee the historical discussion given on pages 176-7 in Ref. [18]. I thank L. de Menezes for bringing this\nreference to my attention.\n\n4\n\n\f21, 22, 23, 24], so the result is quite robust. And at higher order in r, gravitational energy\nbegins to appear, as will be discussed in detail later. The point is there is no contradiction\nab\nab\nbetween (i) the local energy-momentum tensor Tmat\n+ Tgrav\nbeing zero, and (ii) there being\nab\nab\nnonzero stress-energy-momentum in a finite spatial volume. This is because Tmat\n+ Tgrav\nis not a local energy-momentum tensor-indeed, if we accept the previous argument, there\nis no such thing. There is only TBab , associated with the fact that energy is fundamentally\nquasilocal.\nThe main purpose of this Introduction is to emphasize, firstly, that energy is fundamentally quasilocal, i.e., associated with closed spacelike two-surfaces-not points-in spacetime;\nand secondly, there are strong reasons to believe that \u2212k/(8\u03c0) is the correct quasilocal energy surface density. The major unresolved problem is how to choose the right well defined\nenergy reference term, CQEref . Rather than address this problem per se, I will begin with\n\u2212k/(8\u03c0) as an energy surface density and construct a new definition of quasilocal energy\nbased on analogy with the special relativity formula: E 2 \u2212 p~ 2 = m2 . The new definition\nis both physically and geometrically natural, and lies somewhere between the Brown-York\nCQE and the Hawking [25] or Hayward [8] definitions. A reference subtraction procedure\nis still required, that involves a reference embedding, but this is a codimension-two embedding that is not subject to the problem that afflicts the Brown-York embedding prescription.\nMoreover, there is a shift in the physics: the reference embedding is not associated with\ndetermining a reference energy so much as a 'reference angular momentum', so to speak.\nWhy angular momentum? Because angular momentum contributes to energy, and the new\ndefinition can be seen as a precise formulation of this fact at the quasilocal level.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduce the geometrical quantities\nwe will use later. Sec. 3 contains the physical and geometrical motivations behind the new\ndefinition of quasilocal energy (as well as the definition itself). The reference subtraction\nterm is discussed in Sec. 4. In Sec. 5 both the spatial and future null infinity limits of the\nenergy are examined; the small sphere limit is considered in Sec. 6. Finally, in Sec. 7 we\nexamine the new energy in the context of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Since this\nis a lengthy paper I have provided a summary of its results at the end, which also includes\nsome additional discussion.\n\n2\n\nThe geometry of two-dimensional spacelike submanifolds\n\nLet (M, g) be a four-dimensional Lorentzian geometry with signature +2, and S be a\nclosed two-dimensional spacelike submanifold. Let ua and na be timelike and spacelike unit\nnormals to S that are orthogonal to each other: ua ua = \u22121, na na = 1, and ua na = 0. We\nwill assume that S is orientable, and an open neighborhood of S in M is space and time\norientable, so that ua and na are globally well defined [26]. ua and na are fixed up to an\narbitrary local boost transformation:\nu\u2032a = ua cosh \u03bb + na sinh \u03bb\nn\u2032a = ua sinh \u03bb + na cosh \u03bb.\n\n5\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fThe physical picture to keep in mind is that of a finite spatial volume \u03a3, i.e., a threedimensional spacelike submanifold, whose boundary is S. Although S need not be connected,\nnor simply connected, we will often think of \u03a3 as having the topology of a three-ball, and S\nthat of a two-sphere, and thus will sometimes refer to the direction of na (assumed outward\ndirected) as the 'radial' direction. Given such a three-surface \u03a3 spanning S it is natural to\nchoose ua to be orthogonal to \u03a3 (and future directed), in which case na is tangential to \u03a3.\nPhysically, ua is the instantaneous four-velocity of a two-parameter family of observers on\nS. With ua thus tied to the spanning surface \u03a3, a deformation of \u03a3 (preserving S) will in\ngeneral effect a radial boost, Eqs. (2.1).\nThe remainder of this section is a summary of some standard facts about the geometry\nof the submanifold S, as can be found, e.g., in Ref. [27], except here we follow a notation\nsimilar to that used in Ref. [26]. The surface projection operator, Pba , is a tensor defined on\nS by\nPba := \u03b4ba + ua ub \u2212 na nb .\n(2.2)\n(All raising and lowering of indices a, b, c, . . . will be effected with the metric gab , or its inverse,\ng ab .) A 'surface tensor' is defined as a tensor on S that is left invariant under projection of\nall its indices with the surface projection operator. Obviously one such tensor is the spatial\ntwo-metric\n\u03c3ab := Pac Pbd gcd = gab + ua ub \u2212 na nb\n(2.3)\ninduced on S. Another is the corresponding volume form on S, given by\n\u01ebab := \u01ebabcd uc nd ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u01ebabcd is the volume form on M. The symbol dS will be used in place of \u01ebab as the\nintegration measure for (S, \u03c3).\nIf \u2207a denotes the Levi-Civita connection of (M, g), then Da , the Levi-Civita connection\ninduced on (S, \u03c3), is defined by\nb...\nDa Tc...\n= Pad Peb Pcf * * * \u2207d Tfe...\n... ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nb...\nwhere Tc...\nis any surface tensor. Then for any two surface vector fields X a and Y a , the\nGauss formula reads\n(2.6)\nX a \u2207a Y c = X a Da Y c + hc ab X a Y b ,\n\nwhere hc ab is the second fundamental form. Its first index is normal to S, i.e., Pcd hc ab = 0,\nwhereas the remaining two are surface tensor indices, that are symmetric under interchange\n(as can be easily seen by interchanging X and Y in Eq. (2.6) and subtracting the two\nequations). Thus the second fundamental form can be decomposed into components along\nthe two unit normals:\nhc ab = uc lab \u2212 nc kab ,\n(2.7)\nwhere the two extrinsic curvatures are (symmetric) surface tensors given by\nlab = \u2212uc hc ab = Pac Pbd \u2207c ud\nkab = \u2212nc hc ab = Pac Pbd \u2207c nd .\n6\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fIt is useful to decompose the extrinsic curvatures into trace and trace-free parts:\n1\nlab = l\u03c3ab +  \u0303lab\n2\n1\nkab = k\u03c3ab + k\u0303ab ,\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere l = \u03c3 ab lab and k = \u03c3 ab kab , and a tilde appearing over any quantity in this paper will\nalways mean 'trace-free part of'. The mean curvature vector is then\n1\n1\nH c := \u03c3 ab hc ab = (luc \u2212 knc ),\n2\n2\n\n(2.10)\n\nand H * H = (k 2 \u2212 l2 )/4 is the square of the mean curvature.\nExtrinsic curvature is a measure of how a unit normal vector rotates as it is parallelly\npropagated tangent to S in the ambient space (M, g). Two normal vectors means two extrinsic curvatures. However, from Eqs. (2.8) we see that lab and kab measure only the components\nof this rotation tangent to S. There is also a normal component, i.e., the component of the\nrotation of one normal vector along the other. Thus a complete characterization of the\nextrinsic geometry of S requires also the surface one-form\nAa := Pab nc \u2207b uc .\n\n(2.11)\n\nThis is an SO(1, 1) connection in the normal bundle of S, and its associated curvature\ntwo-form is\nFab := Da Ab \u2212 Db Aa .\n(2.12)\nWe will see later that the curvature of the normal bundle of S plays a key role with regard\nto angular momentum.\nWhile the second fundamental form (including H c and H * H) and the curvature of\nthe normal bundle are invariant under local radial boosts, the extrinsic curvatures and the\nconnection on the normal bundle are not. They transform as\n\u2032\nlab\n= lab cosh \u03bb + kab sinh \u03bb\n\u2032\nkab\n= lab sinh \u03bb + kab cosh \u03bb\n\nA\u2032a = Aa + Da \u03bb.\n\n(2.13)\n\nObserve that Aa is different from the other extrinsic curvatures in that its transformation\nlaw, which is a gauge transformation, depends on the derivative of \u03bb.\nOur sign conventions are such that the Riemann tensor of (M, g) is defined by (\u2207a \u2207b \u2212\n\u2207b \u2207a )Xc = Rabc d Xd , and similarly that of (S, \u03c3) by (Da Db \u2212 Db Da )Xc = Rabc d Xd (Xc is\na surface one-form in the latter case). Appropriate projections of the Riemann tensor of\n(M, g) yield the Gauss equation:\nPae Pbf Pcg Pdh Ref gh = Rabcd + (lac lbd \u2212 lbc lad ) \u2212 (kac kbd \u2212 kbc kad ),\n7\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fthe Codazzi equations:\nPae Pbf Pcg uh Ref gh = (Da lbc \u2212 Db lac ) \u2212 (Aa kbc \u2212 Ab kac ),\nPae Pbf Pcg nh Ref gh = (Da kbc \u2212 Db kac ) \u2212 (Aa lbc \u2212 Ab lac ),\n\n(2.15)\n\nand the Ricci equation:\nPae Pbf ug nh Ref gh = \u2212Fab + (ka c lbc \u2212 la c kbc ).\n\n(2.16)\n\nThese are the integrability conditions for the isometric embedding of (S, \u03c3) into (M, g), and\nso by definition of S are necessarily satisfied.\n\n3\n\nThe invariant quasilocal energy\n\nA physical interpretation of the various geometrical quantities introduced in the previous\nsection can be given as follows. The expansion k measures the fractional expansion of the\narea of a small element of S when each point in the element is projected a unit distance\nradially outward. It will have a certain positive value if, for example, S is a round sphere\nenclosing a volume of flat IR3 . (For our present purposes, imagine 'flat IR3 ' as a t = constant\nsurface in Minkowski space.) Now if S is a round sphere of the same area enclosing some\nmatter, then, according to the Einstein equations, the matter curves the space inside S in\nsuch a way that its volume is greater than one would infer by measuring just the area of the\nsphere and using Euclidean geometry. Thus the expansion measured at S must be smaller,\ni.e., the areas of spherical shells at larger radii will not increase as rapidly as expected.\nSo we see that the unreferenced Brown-York quasilocal energy in Eq. (1.1) is greater (less\nnegative) when S contains matter, than when it does not. This is an intuitive reason why\nk is a measure of the energy inside S. (It also explains the need to subtract off a reference\nenergy of the form given in Eq. (1.2): k ref is the nonzero value of k when S merely encloses\na volume of flat IR3 , i.e., no energy.)\nl is similar to k, except that it measures the expansion of S in time, i.e., in the direction\nof the observer's four-velocity ua . Intuitively, if the observers tend to be moving radially\noutward then the area of the two-surface they are on will be expanding, i.e., l > 0. Conversely, a radially inward motion corresponds to l < 0. Thus l (more precisely, l/(8\u03c0)) can\nbe interpreted as a 'radial momentum surface density' [28]. In the case that (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) is\npositive, the observers can always make appropriate local radial boosts such that l = 0 at\neach point of S, a situation corresponding to a 'quasilocal rest frame'. I will comment on\nthis notion more precisely at the end of this section.\nThe trace-free quantities k\u0303ab and  \u0303lab measure the shear of S, and are intimately connected\nwith angular momentum (or at least  \u0303lab is). For example, consider a set of locally nonrotating\nobservers who at coordinate time t are on a constant r, t sphere of the Kerr black hole in\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinates. Their four-velocity is given by\n1\nu =\nN\na\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u03c9\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6\n8\n\n!a\n\n,\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fwhere N is the lapse function, and \u03c9(r, \u03b8) = \u2212gt\u03c6 /g\u03c6\u03c6 is an observer's angular velocity\nas measured from infinity [29]. Starting at Eqs. (2.8) it is not difficult to show that in\nthis case l = 0, so here is an example of observers in a 'quasilocal rest frame' as defined\nabove. Furthermore, one can show that the nonvanishing components of the shear in the\ntime direction are given by\n \u0303l\u03b8\u03c6 =  \u0303l\u03c6\u03b8 = g\u03c6\u03c6 \u2202\u03c9 .\n(3.2)\n2N \u2202\u03b8\nPhysically, a nonzero \u03c9 reflects the frame dragging caused by the rotating black hole. The\nfact that the degree of frame dragging depends on \u03b8 is what makes the observers at different\nlatitudes of the sphere rotate at different rates relative to 'the distant stars', and more to\nthe point, relative to each other. This causes a shear effect between observers at neighboring\nlatitudes, which obviously disappears when the angular momentum is zero.\nFurthermore, let the locally nonrotating observers label themselves with coordinates\n\u2032\n(\u03b8 , \u03c6\u2032 ), which at t = 0 coincide with the Boyer-Lindquist (\u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates on S. Then\nalthough the observers always measure the same two-geometry of S as time t goes on, the\ncomponents of the two-metric \u03c3ab in their (\u03b8\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032) coordinates will differ from those in the\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates by a t- and \u03b8-dependent diffeomorphism along the \u03c6-direction. So although one usually associates shear with a geometrical deformation, for instance a round\nsphere evolving into an ellipsoid, one can also have a physically meaningful shear associated\nwith a continuous parameter family of isometric surfaces. This fact plays an important role\nin understanding certain embedding equations we will encounter later, and will be discussed\nin detail elsewhere [30].\nThe last geometrical quantity to interpret is Aa , the connection in the normal bundle. In\nthe Brown-York analysis the quantity \u2212Aa /(8\u03c0) is called the 'momentum surface density',\nand is denoted as ja [7]. The momentum vector j a is tangential to S, corresponding to\na 'rotating two-surface', and thus should be associated with angular momentum. Indeed,\nthis is correct: Let B denote the timelike three-surface that is the congruence of world lines\nbelonging to the two-parameter family of observers on a two-sphere S. If B admits a Killing\nvector field \u03c6a , whose orbits lie in S, then one can define the angular momentum charge\nJ :=\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS \u03c6a ja ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich can be shown to coincide with the ADM angular momentum at infinity for asymptotically flat spacetimes [7]. Thus we expect both the shear and the connection in the normal\nbundle to play a role in angular momentum at the quasilocal level, and indeed we will see\nthat this turns out to be the case.\nNow the first goal of this paper is to provide a physical motivation for the general relativistic analogue of the special relativity formula: E 2 \u2212 p~ 2 = m2 . First of all, this formula\napplies strictly to point particles (as opposed to extended objects). One imagines determining, say, the instantaneous three-velocity of such a particle by measuring its location in space\nat two closely separated points in time, in some inertial reference frame. In the spirit of the\nquasilocal idea, the analogue of this in general relativity would be to first replace measurements at a point with measurements on a closed spacelike two-surface S. But measurements\nof what? It would seem that 'measurements of the location of the point particle' 'in some\n9\n\n\finertial frame' is to be replaced with 'measurements of the two-geometry of S' 'in a generic\nspacetime'. These measurements are to be repeated at two closely separated points in time.\nIn the point particle case this yields the three-velocity (or the three-momentum p~ if one also\nknows m); in the two-surface case it yields lab , the time component of the extrinsic curvature\nof S. Now I pointed out above that the trace of lab -more precisely l/(8\u03c0)-indeed has the\ninterpretation of a momentum: it is the normal (or radial) momentum surface density [28].\nSo it seems reasonable to replace p~ with l/(8\u03c0). What about the trace-free part of lab ? It\nwas argued above that  \u0303lab is associated with angular momentum. Insofar as angular momentum is qualitatively distinct from linear momentum, its role at least at this point of the\nargument is not clear, and we will simply drop it for now (however, its role will become clear\nlater). Notice that dropping  \u0303lab is at least roughly consistent with being interested only in\nthe two-geometry of S, i.e., the two-metric \u03c3ab modulo diffeomorphisms, since, as indicated\nabove,  \u0303lab is in some cases associated with just diffeomorphisms of S.\nThus, in the expression E 2 \u2212 p~ 2 we will replace ~p with l/(8\u03c0). What should replace E?\nGiven the previous discussion, the obvious answer is the Brown-York energy surface density,\n\u2212k/(8\u03c0). Clearly l/(8\u03c0) and \u2212k/(8\u03c0) are on exactly the same geometrical footing, being\nproportional to the timelike and spacelike components of the mean curvature vector H c (see\nEq. (2.10)). Thus we arrive at the generalization\nE 2 \u2212 ~p 2 \u2212\u2192\n\n1\n(k 2 \u2212 l2 ).\n(8\u03c0)2\n\n(3.4)\n\nNow before we accept this generalization, let us observe that there is something unexpected about it. The four-momentum (E, ~p ) has become a two-momentum, (\u2212k, l)/(8\u03c0).\nWhat happened to the other two components of spatial momentum? l/(8\u03c0) is just the radial component; shouldn't the Brown-York momentum surface density j a (in our notation,\n\u2212Aa /(8\u03c0)), which is tangent to S, be the analogue of the two missing components of p~ ? If\nso, then instead of Eq. (3.4) we should have\n?\n\nE 2 \u2212 p~ 2 \u2212\u2192\n\n1\n(k 2 \u2212 l2 \u2212 Aa Aa ).\n(8\u03c0)2\n\n(3.5)\n\nAt first sight this expression is appealing because it manifestly includes a contribution\nfrom angular momentum, and it is known that in general relativity angular momentum\ncontributes to mass. A simple example that illustrates this phenomenon is the Kerr black\nhole, where the ADM mass in excess of the irreducible mass is due to rotational energy. The\nprecise relationship is [29]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nJ 2\n2\n2\n,\n(3.6)\nMir = M \u2212\n2Mir\nwhere M is the ADM mass, Mir the irreducible mass, and J the angular momentum of\nthe black hole. Comparing the right hand sides of the previous two equations suggests we\nconceptually identify |A|/(8\u03c0)\nwith the angular momentum term, J/(2Mir ), which seems\n\u221a\nreasonable. This leaves k 2 \u2212 l2 /(8\u03c0) to be interpreted as an object like M, viz., a total\nmass, 'total' in the\u221asense that it includes the contribution from angular momentum. But here\nthen is the point: k 2 \u2212 l2 /(8\u03c0) somehow implicitly already includes the angular momentum\n10\n\n\fcontribution to mass. Precisely how will become clear later,\u221abut to see immediately that\nthis is at least plausible, consider the case l = 0. Then \u2212 k 2 \u2212 l2 /(8\u03c0) reduces to the\nBrown-York energy surface density, at least when k is nonnegative, and it is known that the\n(referenced) Brown-York quasilocal energy yields the ADM mass at spatial infinity, which\nincludes the correct angular momentum contribution to mass. So we do not need the Aa Aa\nterm in Eq. (3.5). Besides, putting it in is counter to our goal of seeing if general relativity\nadmits an analogue of the invariant mass, m: While the combination k 2 \u2212 l2 is invariant\nunder radial boosts,5 Aa Aa is not-see Eqs. (2.13). So from this point of view the right hand\nside of Eq. (3.5) is defective, not to mention the generally unsavory fact that it mixes objects\nwith different transformation properties.6 The question of 'missing momentum components'\ncan also be thought about as follows. A point particle has three components of spatial\nmomentum. Likewise, each point on a two-surface S also has three components of spatial\nmomentum (more properly, momentum surface density): one normal, and two tangential\nto S. But being tangential, the latter two are associated with a 'rotating surface', and\nhence with angular momentum. In going from a point to a two-surface, two components\nof the linear momentum have become angular momenta. So they do not (directly at least)\ncontribute to the expression for an invariant mass given on the right hand side of Eq. (3.4)\nbecause, as claimed, this expression already inherently includes the contribution from angular\nmomentum.\nThus we are led to propose the following definition of an 'invariant quasilocal energy' (or\nIQE):\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nIQE = \u2212\ndS k 2 \u2212 l2 \u2212 IQEref ,\n(3.7)\n8\u03c0 S\nwhere IQEref is a reference subtraction term that will be defined later. The word 'invariant'\nin 'IQE' refers to the fact just mentioned, that k 2 \u2212 l2 is invariant under local radial boosts\nof the observers\non S. And the word 'energy' is used instead of 'mass'-despite our analogy\n\u221a\n2\nbetween k \u2212 l2 /(8\u03c0) and the mass m-because, as we will see in Sec. 7, the IQE behaves\nmore like an energy than a mass. So the IQE can be thought of as the amount of 'rest\nenergy' contained in S, a quantity independent of the motion of the observers measuring it.\nNotice that the unreferenced IQE is negative. Nominally the reference energy IQEref is more\nnegative, so that the referenced IQE is positive.\nIt is useful to express the integrand of the unreferenced IQE in two other equivalent\na\nforms. Define the pair of null normals \u03be\u00b1\n:= ua \u00b1 na on S, and the corresponding null\n5\n\nThis was first noted in Ref. [28]. A further discussion of boosted observers in the Brown-York framework\nappears in Ref. [31].\n6\nHayward's [8] definition of quasilocal energy includes an angular momentum contribution of the form\n\u2212\u03c9 a \u03c9a , analogous to the \u2212Aa Aa term in Eq. (3.5). Hayward's \u03c9a is a suitably normalized anholonomicity,\nor 'twist', of the pair of null normals to S, and encodes essentially the same information as Aa . The important\ndistinction is that, unlike the connection Aa , the object \u03c9a is boost invariant, and so representing angular\nmomentum with a term proportional to \u2212\u03c9 a \u03c9a , as Hayward does, is perfectly acceptable. (The relationship\nbetween Aa and \u03c9a is discussed in Appendix B of Ref. [32].) However, there is no need, or even natural\nway for \u03c9a to enter our work here. For instance, the Aa Aa term in Eq. (3.5) cannot simply be replaced\nwith \u03c9 a \u03c9a , since the (tentative) inclusion of this term is suggested by the physical interpretation of Aa as a\nmomentum surface density. This interpretation arises from Brown and York's Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of\nthe gravitational action [7], and it is not clear that a similar interpretation can be given to \u03c9a .\n\n11\n\n\fexpansions\n\u03b8\u00b1 := \u03c3 ab \u2207a \u03be\u00b1 b = l \u00b1 k,\n\n(3.8)\n\ncf. Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9). Then we have the following three equivalent expressions:\n1q\n1\u221a\n1\u221a 2\nk \u2212 l2 =\n\u2212\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 =\nH * H.\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\n(3.9)\n\nFor the last expression recall the definition of the mean curvature given after Eq. (2.10).\nThus the unreferenced IQE in Eq. (3.7) has a very simple geometrical interpretation: up to\na proportionality constant, it is just the mean curvature of S, averaged over S. Because of\nthe square root it is defined only when k 2 \u2212l2 \u2265 0, i.e., at each point of S the mean curvature\nvector H c in Eq. (2.10) must be either spacelike or null, but never timelike. Roughly speaking,\nthis means that the area of S changes more rapidly in a radial direction, than in time. For\nexample, this condition is satisfied for the constant r, t two-spheres outside the horizon of a\nSchwarzschild black hole, but not for those inside; on the horizon the unreferenced IQE is\nzero.\nIn terms of the null expansions, recall that a future (past) trapped surface is one for which\nboth ingoing and outgoing null expansions, \u03b8\u2212 and \u03b8+ , are everywhere negative (positive) on\nS [1]. Thus, the unreferenced IQE is imaginary when S is a future or past trapped surface.\nIt is real only when no point on S is 'trapped'. Now a future trapped surface does not quite\ncharacterize a black hole, and more subtle characterizations have been proposed for a local\ndefinition of a black hole horizon [3, 4, 32]. For example, Hayward [32] has introduced the\nnotion of a 'future outer trapping horizon', H, characterized by: (i) \u03b8\u2212 |H < 0 (in-going light\nrays converging), (ii) \u03b8+ |H = 0 (outgoing light rays instantaneously parallel on the horizon),\n(iii) \u03b8+ |H + > 0 (outgoing light rays diverging just outside the horizon), and (iv) \u03b8+ |H \u2212 < 0\n(outgoing light rays converging just inside the horizon). According to this general definition\nof a black hole, the unreferenced IQE is nonzero just outside the horizon, zero on the horizon,\nand undefined (or imaginary) just inside the horizon. In this connection see also Ref. [33].\nFurthermore, observe that the condition for the integrand of the unreferenced IQE to be\nreal and nonzero, namely k 2 \u2212 l2 > 0, is precisely the same condition that ensures that the\nobservers can always, by appropriate local boosts, go to a 'quasilocal rest frame' in which\nl = 0 at each point of S. Such a two-surface is analogous to a massive particle. The case\nk 2 \u2212 l2 = 0 everywhere on S, for instance when S is a future outer trapping horizon, is\nanalogous to a massless particle, for which no quasilocal rest frame exists. And finally, the\ncase k 2 \u2212 l2 < 0, say 'inside' a future outer trapping horizon, corresponds to a superluminal\nparticle.7\nThe situation\n\u221a is actually more subtle than indicated in the previous two paragraphs. The\nconditions for \u2212\u03b8+ \u03b8\u2212 to be real are reminiscent of the condition \u03b8\u2212 \u2264 0 required for the\nholomorphic case of the Dougan-Mason quasilocal energy to be nonnegative. The conditions\n7\n\nAs noted in the text, the spirit of the quasilocal idea is to replace measurements at a point (of certain\naspects of a point particle, say) with measurements on a closed spacelike two-surface. If one takes seriously\nthat Eq. (3.4) is the generalization of point particle rest mass, then one is quickly led to speculate that a\nclosed spacelike two-surface is the generalization of a point particle. This is curiously reminiscent of string\ntheory, except that the one-dimensional string is replaced by a two-dimensional surface.\n\n12\n\n\f\u03b8+ \u2265 0 and \u03b8\u2212 \u2264 0 essentially imply that the two-surface S is 'suitably' convex [13]. To\nemphasize that \" 'suitably' convex\" is not a serious restriction, in particular it does not mean\nthat S cannot be concave, consider a two-parameter family of observers at rest in an inertial\nframe in flat spacetime. Suppose that at t = 0 they lie on a two-sphere S that is round\nexcept for a small indentation. Then l = 0 at each point of S, and k is positive everywhere\nexcept in a small region near the center of the indentation, where it is negative. Thus there\nwill be a circle of points C at which k = 0. So at each point of S we have k 2 \u2212l2 \u2265 0, equality\nholding on C. One might worry that a radial boost at a point on C will make l2 > 0, and\nhence k 2 \u2212l2 < 0. But of course this will not happen: If we consider a second set of observers,\nboosted relative to the first, then k = l = 0 on C implies k \u2032 = l\u2032 = 0 on C. So we can consider\nthe second set of observers to be boosted radially outward in the region of the indentation,\nsuch that the indentation, and its attendant set of fixed points C, smoothly disappear as the\nsphere evolves in time. k switches from negative to positive by passing through the origin\nof a k\u2013l diagram. Thus we can imagine a wide class of two-surfaces, including ones with\nindentations, and dynamically changing in time, for which k 2 \u2212 l2 \u2265 0 everywhere on S.\nMoreover, bear in mind that the observers are allowed to accelerate, so there is a great deal\nof freedom for them to maintain a 'physically reasonable' S. Nevertheless, what is needed\nhere is a careful analysis based on Raychaudhuri-like equations for a two-parameter family of\naccelerated timelike curves (as opposed to the more usual case of timelike geodesics). Such\na detailed analysis is outside the scope set for this introductory paper.\n\n4\n\nThe reference invariant quasilocal energy\n\nAs in the Brown-York case, the unreferenced IQE diverges in an asymptotically flat\nspacetime as the two-surface S is taken to (spatial or null) infinity, and so must be regulated\nwith a reference term, IQEref , as already anticipated in Eq. (3.7). To better understand\nthe nature of our definition of the invariant quasilocal energy, and to help suggest a natural\nchoice for IQEref , we now make use of the Gauss embedding equation given in Eq. (2.14).\nThis equation has only one independent component. Transvecting both sides with \u03c3 ac \u03c3 bd\nreduces it to the scalar equation\n1\n\u03c3\u03c3R = R \u2212 (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ),\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03c3R is shorthand for \u03c3 ac \u03c3 bd Rabcd , (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) is shorthand for (k\u0303 ab k\u0303ab \u2212  \u0303lab  \u0303lab ), and R is\nthe scalar curvature of (S, \u03c3). Using this equation we can express the IQE given in Eq. (3.7)\nin the equivalent form\n1\nIQE = \u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\nr h\n\n2 R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) \u2212 IQEref .\ni\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe remark here that \u03c3\u03c3R is a natural geometrical object called the sectional curvature of\n(S, \u03c3) as embedded in (M, g) [27]. It will play an important role in what follows.\nNow the definition of the unreferenced IQE is rooted in the extrinsic geometry of the submanifold (S, \u03c3), thought of as a two-surface isometrically embedded in the spacetime (M, g).\n13\n\n\fIt is then natural to define the reference IQE to be of the same form as the unreferenced IQE\nin Eq. (4.2), i.e., to be the same geometrical object, except with (S, \u03c3) now isometrically embedded in a different spacetime-some reference spacetime, (M ref , g ref ). Thus IQEref will be\nthe integral in Eq. (4.2) (or (3.7)), except with all quantities referred to the reference spacetime, which we indicate with a superscript 'ref'. Note that although the extrinsic geometry\nof S will be different in (M ref , g ref ), its intrinsic geometry, by assumption, will not. So in the\nIQEref integral we are constructing we can set dS ref = dS, Rref = R, and (\u03c3\u03c3R)ref = \u03c3\u03c3Rref .\nAlso note that, in general, M ref 6= M (topologically). For example, S may be a two-sphere\nembedded in a black hole spacetime, with M = R2 \u00d7 S 2 , whereas the reference spacetime\nmight be Minkowski space, with M ref = R4 . With this understanding, we define\nIQE\n\nref\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\nq\n\n(k 2\n\n\u2212\n\nl2 )ref\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\nr h\n\n2 R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3Rref + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref .\ni\n\n(4.3)\n\nref\nref\nThe term \u03c3\u03c3Rref is shorthand for \u03c3 ac \u03c3 bd Rabcd\n, where Rabcd\nis the Riemann tensor of the\nreference spacetime.\nTypically one is motivated to choose a reference spacetime of constant curvature, the geometrical reason being that then the Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci embedding equations make no\nreference to 'where' (S, \u03c3) is embedded in (M ref , g ref ). In other words, the conditions placed\nref\nref\non kab\n, lab\n, and Aref\na by the 'reference version' of Eqs. (2.14\u20132.16)-which are just integrability conditions for the reference embedding-do not depend on knowing the embedding\nitself [34]. This is a pleasing criterion because it keeps the reference spacetime 'abstract',\nrather than 'concrete'. For a four-dimensional space of constant curvature we have\nref\nRabcd\n=\n\nC ref ref\nref ref\n(g g \u2212 gbc\ngad ),\n12 ac bd\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere C is the constant value of its scalar curvature. For this choice of reference spacetime\none gets\nC\n\u03c3\u03c3Rref = .\n(4.5)\n6\nFor example, for Minkowski space we have C = 0, and for anti-de Sitter space we have\nC = \u221212/l2 , where l is the radius of curvature of the anti-de Sitter space, and is related to\nthe (negative) cosmological constant \u039b by \u039b = \u22123/l2 . We will return to these two examples\nlater.\nThe idea of embedding (S, \u03c3) into some reference space(time) is in the same spirit as\nthe Brown-York\napproach, but an important difference that arises out of using the invariant\n\u221a\n2\nquantity k \u2212 l2 , rather than k, deserves further comment. In the Brown-York approach k\nis the trace of the extrinsic curvature of (S, \u03c3) as embedded in a three-geometry, (\u03a3, h), where\n\u03a3 is a spacelike three-surface spanning S, with induced metric hab . Thus it is natural to take\nk ref as the trace of the extrinsic curvature of (S, \u03c3) as embedded in some three-dimensional\nreference space, (\u03a3ref , href ). So the embeddings of S, for both the unreferenced and\n\u221a reference\nCQE, inherently have a three-dimensional target space. On the other hand, k 2 \u2212 l2 is\nproportional to a geometrical invariant of S, namely its mean curvature, and makes no\nessential reference to a spanning three-surface \u03a3 (making the IQE 'truly quasilocal' in the\n14\n\n\fsense that it depends on S alone8 ). As a consequence, the embeddings inherently have a\nfour-dimensional target space(time).\nThe advantage of a three-dimensional target reference space, say flat IR3 , is that when\nthe embedding exists, it is unique (up to translations and rotations), and so the Brown-York\nCQEref is unique. The disadvantage, as is well known, is that such embeddings do not exist\nfor all (S, \u03c3) of interest, and this problem is not limited to just a few isolated exceptional\ncases.\nFor a four-dimensional target reference spacetime, say Minkowski space, the situation\nis reversed: an embedding always exists, but it is not unique. Regarding the first half\nof this statement, Brinkmann [35] has shown, by a simple explicit construction, that any\nn-dimensional conformally flat Riemann space can be considered as a particular cut of a\nlight cone in (n + 2)-dimensional Minkowski space. And conversely, any cut of such a light\ncone gives an n-dimensional conformally flat Riemann space. Now any n = 2 space is, of\ncourse, conformally flat, and thus any (S, \u03c3) can always be so embedded, even if S has\nregions with negative scalar curvature. In the Introduction I mentioned the example of\nthe horizon of the Kerr black hole, which cannot be globally embedded into flat IR3 when\nthe angular momentum exceeds the irreducible mass, which coincides with the two-sphere\ndeveloping regions with negative scalar curvature [16]. However, it is a simple exercise to\napply Brinkmann's construction and thus globally embed the horizon into a light cone of\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space. I will omit the details of this calculation, and just note\nthat the embedding is valid for all angular momentum J (up to and including the extremal\nblack hole case), and changes smoothly with J, including at the critical point when J equals\nthe irreducible mass.\nOn the other hand, in a codimension-two (versus -one) embedding there is more 'elbow\nroom', and consequently the embedding is not unique-there is a function worth of freedom\n(which will be discussed in detail in Ref. [30]). This results in an ambiguity in the reference\nenergy, IQEref , which enters via the reference shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref -see Eq. (4.3). This is\nthe only term in IQEref not yet determined, and the only one for which we require a reference\nembedding. Observe that in the Brown-York approach the undetermined quantity is k ref , an\nexpansion. Here it is (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref , a shear. I will now argue that it is precisely this term that\nplays the key role in properly incorporating angular momentum into the IQE. The basic idea\nis simple, but first we will introduce some notation.\na\nIn the previous section we introduced the null normals \u03be\u00b1\n= ua \u00b1 na , and corresponding\nnull expansions \u03b8\u00b1 = l \u00b1 k in Eq. (3.8). Similarly, the (trace-free) shears in the two null\ndirections are defined by s\u00b1 ab :=  \u0303lab \u00b1 k\u0303ab . The curvature of the normal bundle has only\none independent component, and can be written as Fab = (F /2)\u01ebab for some scalar field\nF , where \u01ebab is the volume form on S defined earlier in Eq. (2.4). With this notation, and\nassuming that the reference spacetime is one of constant curvature, i.e., Eq. (4.5) holds, the\n8\n\nThe CQE can also be made 'truly quasilocal', in a slightly different sense: by relaxing the restriction that\nthe foliation of the spacetime (i.e., \u03a3) be orthogonal to the boundary B [7], it is shown in Ref. [31] that the\nresulting CQE no longer depends on \u03a3, but instead just depends on the foliation of B.\n\n15\n\n\fGauss, Codazzi, and Ricci embedding equations given at the end of Sec. 2 take the form\nC\n1 ref ref\na ref b\n= R + \u03b8+\n\u03b8\u2212 \u2212 sref\n+ b s\u2212 a ,\n6\n2\n1\nref\nref ref b\n0 = (Da \u2213 Aref\na )\u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 (Db \u2213 Ab )s\u00b1 a ,\n2\n1\nref b\n0 = F ref + \u01ebab [sref\n+ , s\u2212 ] a .\n2\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n(4.8)\n\nref b\nref b ref c\nIn the Ricci equation, [sref\n+ , s\u2212 ] a denotes the commutator of the shears: s+ c s\u2212 a \u2212\nb ref c\na\na\nsref\n\u2212 c s+ a . Notice that by using null directions, rather than u and n , the Codazzi equations\nhave decoupled into a '+' and a '\u2212' set.\nOur task is thus: Given \u03c3ab , and hence R, Da , and \u01ebab , solve these embedding equations\nref\nref\nref\nis not an\n= 2\u01ebab Da Aref\nfor the unknown quantities \u03b8\u00b1\n, sref\nb\n\u00b1 ab , and Aa . (Of course F\nindependent quantity.) In particular, we are interested in the solution for the boost invariant\nreference shear term\na ref b\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref \u2261 \u2212sref\n(4.9)\n+ b s\u2212 a ,\n\nappearing in the Gauss equation, which is to then be substituted into the second integral of\nref ref\nEq. (4.3). Or equivalently, solve for (k 2 \u2212 l2 )ref \u2261 \u2212\u03b8+\n\u03b8\u2212 and substitute the answer into\nref\nthe first integral of Eq. (4.3). This is how IQE is determined.\nHowever, as already noted, any solution we obtain is not unique. We can see this imref\nmediately by counting functional degrees of freedom. \u03b8\u00b1\nare two functions, sref\n\u00b1 ab are four\nref\n(the two shears are symmetric and trace-free), and Aa are two. These eight functions are\nsubject to six equations: Gauss is one, Codazzi are four, and Ricci is one. This leaves two\narbitrary functions in the solution. But owing to the invariance of the embedding equations\nunder a local boost transformation (see Eqs. (2.13)), one of these functions is just the boost\nparameter, \u03bb, leaving one nontrivial arbitrary function in the solution.\nThe question then arises, Is there a natural way to impose one additional functional\ncondition on the unknowns so that the embedding, subject to this additional condition, is\nunique, and hence IQEref is unique? One of the central ideas in this paper is to impose the\nadditional condition\nF ref = F ,\n(4.10)\ni.e., the curvature of the normal bundle of S as embedded in the reference spacetime\n(M ref , g ref ) should equal that of S as embedded in the original physical spacetime, (M, g).\nThere are several reasons why it is geometrically natural to demand F ref = F . First, the\ntwo-surface S has two connections: one is an SO(2) connection on the tangent bundle of S,\nassociated with the curvature Rabcd (which has only one independent component, namely\nR), and the other is an SO(1, 1) connection on the normal bundle of S, associated with the\ncurvature Fab (which also has only one independent component, namely F ). In fact both\nof these connections are metric connections, associated with the metrics in the tangent and\nnormal bundles to S, respectively [27]. Furthermore, Szabados [26] has considered the twodimensional version of the Sen connection for spinors and tensors on a submanifold such as\nS, and has found that the two-surface spinor curvature has, essentially, imaginary part equal\n16\n\n\fto R, and real part equal to F . Finally, although Aa is a measure of extrinsic geometry,\nas pointed out earlier it is not really on the same footing as the extrinsic curvatures kab\nand lab , since its transformation law under local radial boosts is qualitatively different-see\nEqs.(2.13). It transforms like the connection that it is, and gives rise to a curvature, and so\narguably has more in common with R than with kab and lab . The point is, F is really on the\nsame geometrical footing as R. We have already demanded that Rref = R, as a necessary\ncondition for the embedding of (S, \u03c3) into (M ref , g ref ) to be isometric. So demanding also\nthat F ref = F is thus seen to be quite natural.\nUnfortunately, implementing Eq. (4.10) seems like an intractable task. Embedding equations involving curvature of the normal bundle, i.e., codimension-two (and higher) embeddings, have, of course, been studied for a long time. With regard to solutions, although one\nexpects to be able to express (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref in terms of F , R, and their derivatives, I am not\naware of any such general results in the literature. In fact, much of the literature on such\nembeddings considers the case F = 0, which is not the case we are particularly interested in\nhere (a notable exception is Ref. [27]). One possible way to proceed is as follows. Given F ref\nref\n(= F by Eq. (4.10)), choose Aref\n= 2\u01ebab Da Aref\na such that F\nb . There may be a convenient\nref\nref\ngauge choice, such as D * A = 0, or l = 0. Then view the Codazzi equations (4.7) as a\nset of four linear partial differential equations for the four independent degrees of freedom\nin the two shears. These equations are of second order if one makes use of the fact that\nany trace-free symmetric tensor sab on a two-surface (S, \u03c3) with two-sphere topology can be\nexpressed as sab = Da vb +Db va \u2212\u03c3ab D *v for some vector field v a . Thus solve for sref\n\u00b1 ab in terms\nref\nof the expansions, \u03b8\u00b1 , and their derivatives. The expressions one obtains at this stage are,\nin general, nonlocal. Then substitute these into the Gauss and Ricci equations, (4.6) and\n(4.8), which are really just nonlinear algebraic constraints. But because the shears involve\nnonlocal operators acting on the expansions, one ends up with two nonlocal and nonlinear\npartial differential equations for the two expansions. Remarkably, it is almost possible to\nsolve these equations, but in the end one encounters a certain combination of nonlocality\nand nonlinearity that makes the final step to a solution seem impossible. Nevertheless, it\nappears that the solution for (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref , if it can be found, almost certainly depends in a\nsimple way on both R and F , and derivatives (of a finite or possibly infinite order) of these\ntwo curvatures. I am suggesting that it is through this subtle presence of F in (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref\nthat angular momentum is properly incorporated into the IQE.\nSo although a direct attack on the embedding equations has not yet yielded a solution,\nfortunately one can make some progress of a general nature by calculating the first and second\norder variations of F ref and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref under isometric deformations of a given embedding.\nThe idea is to see how both of these quantities change under such a deformation, and\nthereby infer how (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref depends on F ref , and hence angular momentum. The results\nare somewhat involved, and will be given elsewhere [30]. For now let us start by making\nsome simple observations regarding the enigmatic object (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref .\nTo begin with, one might object to our argument thus far because it implies that (k\u0303 2 \u2212\n2\nref\n \u0303l ) , and hence IQEref , depends on the extrinsic geometry of S as embedding in the physical\nspacetime. In particular, through Eq. (4.10) and the reference embedding equations, (k\u0303 2 \u2212\n \u0303l2 )ref depends on F . On the other hand, it is often stated that a reference subtraction term\n17\n\n\fshould be a functional of only the intrinsic geometry of (S, \u03c3). However, notice that there\nis no dependence on the extrinsic curvatures proper, i.e. lab and kab , only a dependence\non F , a quantity which I argued above is really on the same geometrical footing as the\nintrinsic quantity R. Moreover, as discussed in the Introduction (refer to Eq. (1.5)), in the\nBrown-York approach one is free to add to the action any functional of the boundary threemetric, \u03b3ab , which contains information about the two-metric \u03c3ab , as well as information\nabout how (S, \u03c3) is embedded in the three-boundary B. For instance, one could add to the\naction a boundary integral of the scalar curvature of B, whose variation would add to \u03a0ab\nin Eq. (1.5) a term proportional to the Einstein tensor of \u03b3ab , as is done in Ref. [36]. Such a\nterm obviously depends on some extrinsic geometry of (S, \u03c3). In Brown and York's work this\nfact is of course recognized, but being in a Hamiltonian framework, they restrict the form\nof the arbitrary boundary functional such that the energy surface density (\u2212k/(8\u03c0)) and\nmomentum surface density (\u2212Aa /(8\u03c0)) of S in a particular spacelike hypersurface \u03a3 depend\nonly on the canonical data on \u03a3. This effectively means that their reference subtraction\nterm can depend\u221aonly on \u03c3ab [7]. But as I emphasized earlier, our approach is based on the\ninvariant object k 2 \u2212 l2 , and makes no essential reference to a three-surface \u03a3 spanning S.\nThe invariant quasilocal energy constructed here does not come out of a canonical analysis,\nso there is no reason that our subtraction term cannot depend on F .\nSo the shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is allowed, but is it really necessary? Perhaps it is just\nan unsavory term resulting from a poor definition of the IQE. For instance, looking at the\nGauss embedding equation (4.1) one might be tempted to write, instead of Eq. (3.4),\n?\n\nE 2 \u2212 p~ 2 \u2212\u2192\n\n1\n[(k 2 \u2212 l2 ) \u2212 2(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )],\n(8\u03c0)2\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere the additional shear term on the right hand side is perhaps the proper way to include\nangular momentum, somewhat like the Aa Aa term we attempted in Eq. (3.5). This would\nhave the advantage of changing IQEref in Eq. (4.3) to\nIQE\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nref ?\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\nq\n\n2 [R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3Rref ],\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich is clearly unique, and moreover, requires no reference embedding. Eq. (4.12) is a more\ngeneral case of the zero point energy suggested by Lau [37] (except that his derivation of\nit requires a reference embedding-we will return to this point later). But unfortunately it\ncannot be correct. For example, when the reference spacetime\n\u221a is Minkowski space, Eq. (4.5)\nref\ntells us that \u03c3\u03c3R = 0 and thus the radical reduces to 2R, which is not defined for\nnegative R. Nor is this problem properly solved by taking C 6= 0 in Eq. (4.5), since this\nwould put an ad hoc fixed lower bound on R.\nSo the shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is not only allowed, it is necessary (or at least its absence\nleads to an unsatisfactory result). In fact its role seems to be to keep nonnegative what\nis under the square root in Eq. (4.3). To see this more clearly, consider the special case\nthat (S, \u03c3) is embeddable in flat IR3 . If our reference spacetime is Minkowski space, we can\nthen choose to embed (S, \u03c3) in a t = constant slice and, within this slice, the embedding is\nref\nessentially unique. In this case it is easy to see that we will have lab\n= 0. And by assumption,\n18\n\n\f\u03c3\u03c3Rref = 0, so Eq. (4.3) reduces to\nref\n\nIQE |lab\nref =0\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\n1\ndS |k | = \u2212\n8\u03c0\nref\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\nr h\n\ni\n\n2 R + (k\u0303 ref )2 .\n\n(4.13)\n\nref\nThe uniqueness of the embedding means that k ref and k\u0303ab\nare unique. Now clearly, no matter\nref\nwhat the surface is, the spatial shear k\u0303ab must be such that what is under the square root\nin Eq. (4.13) is nonnegative, because |k ref | is real. (More properly, one should look at the\n'reference version' of Eq. (4.1), with (lref )2 = ( \u0303lref )2 = \u03c3\u03c3Rref = 0.) For example, consider a\ndumb-bell-shaped surface of revolution in flat IR3 . In a region near the throat of this surface\nR is negative, nevertheless at every point of the surface we have R + (k\u0303 ref )2 \u2265 0.\nI emphasize that, even when (S, \u03c3) can be embedded in flat IR3 , its embedding in\nMinkowski space need not be chosen to be in a t = constant slice, as was done in the\nprevious paragraph. One may also embed it in a light cone, or in a host of other ways-\nremember that there is a function-worth of freedom in our choice. I argued in the context of\nEq. (4.10) that this freedom has to do with angular momentum, or more precisely, the curref\nref\nvature of the normal bundle. For the t = constant embedding,  \u0303lab\n= 0 implies sref\n\u00b1 ab = \u00b1k\u0303ab ,\nand so inspection of Eq. (4.8) reveals that in this case F ref = 0. However, it is not hard\nto see that starting with such a t = constant embedding one can perform an infinitesimal\nisometric deformation of the embedding out of the t = constant plane, i.e., in a direction\n\u03c6\u2202/\u2202t, where \u03c6 is an arbitrary function. Furthermore, I show in Ref. [30] that after such an\ninfinitesimal deformation F ref is no longer zero, and can in fact be made to be essentially\nany infinitesimal function we like by a suitable choice of \u03c6. It is not hard to imagine (just\nhard to do!) that by integrating such isometric deformations one may be able to achieve a\ntwo-geometry (S, \u03c3) isometrically embedded with any desired curvature of the normal bundle. With this in mind, it would seem unnatural to reference-embed, e.g., a constant r, t\ntwo-sphere of the Kerr geometry (which is easily shown to have F =\n6 0) as a two-sphere\nref\nin a Minkowski reference spacetime with F = 0 (say, in a t = constant slice), when it\nseems possible to instead embed it with F ref = F . Note, however, that as the embedding is\nref\ndeformed out of the t = constant surface,  \u0303lab\nwill also cease to be zero, and so will introduce\na negative contribution to the quantity under the square root in Eq. (4.3). This jeopardizes\nthe nonnegativity of this quantity. But at the same time we clearly cannot simply throw\naway the \u2212( \u0303lref )2 term, since this would violate a key property of the IQE, namely its invariance under local boosts. Short of solving the embedding equations for a generic F ref\nand explicitly checking, I do not know of any guarantee of nonnegativity. Equivalently, in\nquestion here is the nonnegativity of the quantity (k 2 \u2212 l2 )ref , which is the same type of\nquestion as the nonnegativity of (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) discussed at the end of Sec. 3. I do not at present\nhave a complete answer to either of these difficult questions.\nFinally, one might guess that it is possible to avoid the embedding problem entirely by\nsimply setting (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref = (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ), which is in the same spirit as Eq. (4.10) in that, like\nF , the shear term has something to do with angular momentum. But this does not work.\nFor example, it is not hard to show that, although (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) is in general nonvanishing on\nconstant r, t spheres of the Kerr geometry, it happens to vanish on the horizon. So if we set\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref = (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ), then in calculating IQEref for the Kerr horizon example we would\n\n19\n\n\frun into the same problem with negative R as we did in Eq. (4.12). So such a prescription\nmust not be valid, and we cannot avoid the embedding problem this way.\nLet us conclude this section by addressing the question, What is the relationship between\nthe IQE defined here and the Brown-York CQE? We begin by supposing that the following\nfour conditions are satisfied: (i) (S, \u03c3) is a two-surface in the physical spacetime such that\nk 2 \u2212 l2 > 0; (ii) k > 0; (iii) (S, \u03c3) is such that it can be embedded in flat IR3 ; and (iv) for the\nembedding in (iii), k ref \u2265 0. As discussed earlier, condition (i) ensures that the unreferenced\nIQE is well defined-roughly speaking, S is strictly outside of a black hole. Then it is always\npossible to go to a 'quasilocal rest frame' where l = 0 on S, and the integrand in Eq. (3.7) is\njust |k|. Given condition (ii), the unreferenced IQE thus reduces to the unreferenced CQE\nin Eq. (1.1), provided the observers in the Brown-York case are in a 'quasilocal rest frame'.\nCondition (iii) ensures that the Brown-York prescription is well-defined, and allows us to\nchoose a t = constant embedding in Minkowski space, as above, and get Eq. (4.13). The\nfirst integral in this equation, together with condition (iv), shows that our IQEref reduces\nto the Brown-York CQEref in Eq. (1.2). So if these conditions hold, and we choose to use\na t = constant embedding to calculate IQEref , then our invariant quasilocal energy is the\nsame as the Brown-York 'rest energy'. In most applications considered in the literature these\nconditions are satisfied, and the IQE will then share all of the desirable properties of the\nCQE. For example, it will be the thermodynamic energy that appears in the first law of\nblack hole thermodynamics for Schwarzschild black holes, as considered in Ref. [7].\nOn the other hand, I emphasize that conditions (ii) and (iv) are easily violated. One\nneed only think of a round sphere with a small indentation, an example discussed at the\nend of Sec. 3 (except here the spacetime is generic). So in general, the IQE defined here is\nnot simply the Brown-York 'rest energy'. Furthermore, we need not choose a t = constant\nembedding to calculate IQEref . Indeed, as I have argued, such a choice is unnatural when\nF=\n6 0. In short, the invariant quasilocal energy defined here is not quite the same object as\nthe Brown-York quasilocal energy. Note that the aforementioned thermodynamic nature of\nthe CQE is derived in Ref. [7] assuming that S is a round sphere. It would be interesting to\nextend this analysis to indented spheres, for instance, and determine which, if either of the\nCQE or IQE, is the 'correct' thermodynamic energy.\n\n5\n\nThe large sphere limit of the IQE\n\nLet us now assume that the spacetime (M, g) is asymptotically flat, and evaluate the\nlimit of the invariant quasilocal energy as (S, \u03c3) tends to a large sphere at infinity. At\nspatial and null infinity we might expect these limits to be the ADM and Bondi-Sachs\nmasses, respectively. Let us see if this is so.\nLet \u03c4 be a 'time' function on M such that \u03c4 = \u03c4\u2217 defines a spacelike (respectively, null)\nhypersurface H\u03c4\u2217 of topology R \u00d7S 2 extending to spatial (respectively, null) infinity. Letting\nthe parameter \u03c4\u2217 vary over some range gives a foliation of a part of M. Let r be a function\non M such that r = r\u2217 defines a hypersurface that intersects each leaf H\u03c4\u2217 (over the allowed\nrange of \u03c4\u2217 ) in a spacelike two-sphere, S\u03c4\u2217 ,r\u2217 . The parameter r\u2217 ranges to infinity, and over\nits range the surfaces S\u03c4\u2217 ,r\u2217 provide a foliation of H\u03c4\u2217 . We are interested in the limit r\u2217 \u2192 \u221e,\n20\n\n\fwith \u03c4\u2217 arbitrary but fixed. In a rather benign abuse of notation we will refer to S\u03c4\u2217 ,r\u2217 as\nsimply S, and 'take the limit as r \u2192 \u221e with \u03c4 fixed'. The metric induced on S will, as\nusual, be denoted as \u03c3ab (in abstract index notation).\nNow assume that the functions \u03c4 and r have been chosen such that (S, \u03c3) tends to a round\nsphere at infinity. Thus the components of its metric in spherical coordinates xi = (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nhave an asymptotic expansion of the form\n\u03c3ij = r\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n0 sin2 \u03b8\n\n!\n\nX\nY sin \u03b8\nY sin \u03b8 Z sin2 \u03b8\n\n+ 2r\n\n!\n\n+ O< (r).\n\n(5.1)\n\nIn this expansion, X, Y , and Z are each arbitrary functions of \u03c4 , \u03b8, and \u03c6. The symbol\nO< (r \u2212n ) denotes a term that falls off faster (or grows more slowly, depending on the sign of\nn) than r \u2212n , but not necessarily according to a power of r. For example, rather than O(1),\nthe remainder term O< (r) might grow as ln r. The motivation for this increased generality\nwill be explained below when we consider the large sphere limit at null infinity. \u221a\nFurthermore,\nwe can choose (the function) r to be an areal radius, in which case we may take \u03c3 = r 2 sin \u03b8,\nwhere \u03c3 = det \u03c3ij . It is easy to see that this requires Z = \u2212X in Eq. (5.1).\nThe scalar curvature of a round sphere of areal radius r is 2/r 2 . Since the metric in\nEq. (5.1) differs from that of a round sphere by a term one power lower in r, we immediately\nhave that its scalar curvature R is given by\nR=\n\n\u2206R\n2\n+ 3 ,\n2\nr\nr\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere the remainder term \u2206R is of order one.9 In our asymptotically flat spacetime the\ncomponents of the Riemann tensor fall off as 1/r 3, and so the same will be true of \u03c3\u03c3R, the\nsectional curvature of (S, \u03c3). In the present context the appropriate reference spacetime is\nMinkowski space, and so \u03c3\u03c3Rref = 0. The only other terms to consider in Eqs. (4.2) and\n(4.3) are the shear terms, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . We will see below that these, too, fall off\nat least as fast as 1/r 3 in both the spatial and null infinity limits. In the large sphere limit\nthe unreferenced IQE thus behaves as\nIQE\n\nunref\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\ns \u0014\n\n2\n\n2\n\u2206R\n+\n\u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )\nr2\nr3\n\n\u0015\n\n(\n)\n\u0014\n\u0015\nr 2 \u2206R\n2\n1 Z\n2\n2\n\u22122\n1+\n\u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R + (k\u0303 \u2212  \u0303l ) + O(r ) .\ndS\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0 S\nr\n4 r3\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe reference IQE behaves similarly, except we have \u03c3\u03c3Rref = 0.

[38] it is shown that \u2206R = D * v + O< (1) for some vector field v in S. In other words, to leading\norder \u2206R is a divergence. This plays a crucial role in some of the results in Ref. [38]. However, we will\nnot need to use this fact, except to provide some insight into our discussion of the 'solution' of the Ricci\nembedding equation in Sec. 5.2.\n\n21\n\n\fIn forming the difference of the previous two expressions it is important to observe that not\nonly do the divergent terms coming from the 2/r 2 piece of R cancel, but also the (finite)\nremainder terms \u2206R are the same in both, and thus also cancel, independent of what \u2206R\nis. Thus we find that the large sphere behavior of the (referenced) IQE is given by\nIQE =\n\n1 Z\ndS r [\u03c3\u03c3R \u2212 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref + O(r \u22124)].\n16\u03c0 S\n\n(5.5)\n\nOf course if the shear terms fall off as 1/r 4 or faster they get absorbed into the O(r \u22124)\nremainder term. It is worth emphasizing that in the large sphere limit the square root in\nthe IQE is eliminated by the fact that R dominatesqover the other terms. The areal radius\nfactor r outside the brackets in Eq. (5.5) is really 2/R.10 In Sec. 6 we will see a similar\nmechanism at work in the small sphere limit. But in the intermediate regime the IQE is, in\ngeneral, an integral of the difference of two radicals.\nAs a quick check of Eq. (5.5) let us evaluate the right hand side for the Schwarzschild\ngeometry. In the usual Schwarzschild coordinates r is an areal radius, and it is a simple\nexercise to compute the sectional curvature of a t, r = constant two-sphere. The result is:\n\u03c3\u03c3R = 4M/r 3 . The shear terms obviously vanish, and with dS = r 2 d\u03a9 (d\u03a9 the measure on\nthe unit round sphere) one immediately gets IQE = M, the ADM mass of the black hole.\nNow the main task is to investigate in detail the shear terms in Eq. (5.5), which we will do\nseparately for the spatial and null infinity limits, respectively.\n\n5.1\n\nThe spatial infinity limit\n\nRather than proceed with complete generality, it is more instructive to consider an asymptotically flat metric that exhibits angular momentum explicitly, and then see how this angular\nmomentum works its way into the shear terms. (We will be completely general in the more\ninteresting null infinity limit case.) The spacetime far from any isolated stationary (nonradiating) rotating source is described asymptotically by the Kerr metric (see Secs. 19.3 and\n33.3 of Ref. [29]), so let us take (M, g) to be the Kerr spacetime. We choose the following\nbasis of orthonormal one-forms:\n\u03c1\n\u221a\n(5.6)\ne0 = N dt, e1 = \u221a dr, e2 = \u03c1 d\u03b8, e3 = g\u03c6\u03c6 (d\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c9 dt),\n\u2206\nwhich are associated with locally nonrotating observers. The corresponding basis of orthonormal vector fields is\n\u221a\n\u2206\n1\n1\n1\ne0 = (\u2202t + \u03c9\u2202\u03c6 ), e1 =\n(5.7)\n\u2202r , e2 = \u2202\u03b8 , e3 = \u221a \u2202\u03c6 .\nN\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\ng\u03c6\u03c6\nThe notation used is standard: xa = (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) are Boyer-Lindquist coordinates,\n\u03c9(r, \u03b8) =\nq\n2\n\u2212gt\u03c6 /g\u03c6\u03c6 is an observer's angular velocity as measured from infinity, N = \u03c9 g\u03c6\u03c6 \u2212 gtt is\n10\n\nThis mechanism works even when the sphere is not asymptotically round. In this case the shear terms\ncontribute at a higher order, viz. 1/r2 , in an\npeffort to keep what is under the square root sign positive, as\ndiscussed earlier. In other words, the factor 2/R is modified in such a way that negative R is likely not a\nproblem. We will not consider this more complicated case here.\n\n22\n\n\fthe lapse function, etc. (see, e.g., Sec. 33.4 of Ref. [29]). Let A, B, . . . be indices labeling\nthe basis vectors and one-forms, ranging from 0 to 3, and I, J, . . . denote the subset of these\ntaking values 2 and 3. These indices are raised and lowered with the flat Lorentz metric\n\u03b7AB = \u03b7 AB = diagonal(\u22121, 1, 1, 1).\nThe vector fields eI a are tangent to any r, t = constant two-sphere S, and so ua := e0 a\nand na := e1 a are, respectively, timelike and spacelike unit vectors orthogonal to S. From\nEqs. (2.8) we see that the orthonormal basis components of the extrinsic curvatures lab and\nkab are given by\nlIJ = eI a eJb \u2207a ub = \u2212\u03c90JI ,\n\n(5.8)\n\nkIJ = eI a eJb \u2207a nb = \u2212\u03c91JI .\n\n(5.9)\n\nHere \u03c9CBA = \u2212eAa eBb \u2207a eCb are Ricci rotation coefficients. Working out these coefficients11\nI find that the trace-free parts of lIJ and kIJ are given by\n!\n\u221a\n \u0303lIJ = \u03b1 0 1 , where \u03b1 = g\u03c6\u03c6 \u2202\u03b8 \u03c9,\n(5.10)\n1 0\n2N\u03c1\n\u221a\n!\n\u2206\n\u03c1\n1 0\nk\u0303IJ = \u03b2\n, where \u03b2 =\n\u2202r ln \u221a .\n(5.11)\n0 \u22121\n2\u03c1\ng\u03c6\u03c6\nGeometrically, the coefficient \u03b1 is just e1 * \u03a9(precess) , i.e., the radial component of the angular\nvelocity vector \u03a9(precess) that measures the precession of a gyroscope carried by a locally nonrotating observer, relative to the observer's orthonormal frame (see Eq. (33.24) of Ref. [29];\ncompare also with Eq.(3.2) above, and the discussion following it). Thus, the unreferenced\nshear term in Eq. (5.5) is given by\n1\na4\n(k\u0303 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) = 2(\u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b12 ) = 6 sin4 \u03b8 + O 7 ,\n2r\nr\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere the last expression on the right hand side is the large r asymptotic expansion. So\nclearly, being of order 1/r 6, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) does not contribute to the large sphere limit of the IQE\nat spatial infinity.\nWhat about the reference term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref ? It is plausible that the reference term is\nof the same order in 1/r as the unreferenced term, viz. 1/r 6, or less, and so also does not\ncontribute. However, to be certain one needs to solve the embedding equations (4.6-4.8),\nsubject to the condition F ref = F , as argued in Sec. 4. We will not attempt to do so here,\nbut it is instructive to at least work out what F is for the Kerr geometry. From Eq. (2.11)\nwe see that the orthonormal basis components of the connection in the normal bundle are\ngiven by\nAI = eI b nc \u2207b uc = \u2212\u03c901I .\n(5.13)\n11\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to recognize that, with Z = 0 or 1, \u03c9ZJI = \u03b1(IJ)Z , where \u03b1CAB = ieB ieA deC .\nThus we need only compute the exterior derivative of eI .\n\n23\n\n\fEvaluating these Ricci rotation coefficients reveals that the one-form A = AI eI (pulled back\nto the two-sphere S) is given by\n\u221a\n\u0012 \u0013\ng\u03c6\u03c6 \u2206\n3aM\n1\nA = \u03b3 d\u03c6, where \u03b3 =\n\u2202r \u03c9 = \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8 + O 4 .\n(5.14)\n2N\u03c1\nr\nr\nRecall that \u03c9 = \u03c9(r, \u03b8) is a measure of the frame dragging produced by the rotating geometry.\nWhile the shear in the time direction measures the \u03b8 dependence of \u03c9 (see \u03b1 in Eq. (5.10)),\nEq. (5.14) shows that the connection in the normal bundle measures its r dependence. Both\nare measures of angular momentum.\nCalculating the exterior derivative of A leads to the curvature in the normal bundle:\n\u221a\n!\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n6aM\ng\u03c6\u03c6 \u2206\n1\nF=\u221a\n(5.15)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202r \u03c9 = \u2212 4 cos \u03b8 + O 6 ,\ng\u03c6\u03c6 \u03c1\n2N\u03c1\nr\nr\nwhich is of order 1/r 4 . Inspection of the Ricci equation (4.8), or Eq. (2.16) with the left\nhand side set to zero, reveals that a solution to the reference embedding equations, subject\nref\nref\nto Eq. (4.10), requires that  \u0303lIJ\nand k\u0303IJ\nbe two matrices whose commutator is of order\n4\n1/r . On the other hand, one might guess that the trace of the difference of their squares,\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref , might be of order 1/r 6, as suggested above. It is not difficult to convince oneself\nthat these two conditions are not incompatible, so the reference embedding equations at\nleast do not obviously forbid the reference shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref from being of the same\norder of magnitude as (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ), such that neither contributes to the IQE.\nIn any case, assuming just that (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is at most O< (r \u22123), which is almost certainly\ntrue, we find that the large sphere limit of the IQE at spatial infinity is given by\n1 Z\nlim IQE = lim\ndS r \u03c3\u03c3R.\nr\u2192\u221e\nr\u2192\u221e 16\u03c0 S\n\n(5.16)\n\nThis limit of the IQE thus has a simple geometrical interpretation: apart from a factor\nproportional to the areal radius r, it is just the average over S of the sectional curvature of\n(S, \u03c3) as embedded in the physical spacetime (M, g).\nNow let us assume that (M, g) is vacuum (Rab = 0) near spatial infinity, so that there\nthe Riemann tensor reduces to the Weyl tensor, Cabcd . From the definition of the two-surface\nmetric given in Eq. (2.3), and the fact that the Weyl tensor is traceless, one immediately\ngets\n\u03c3\u03c3R = 2Eab na nb .\n(5.17)\nThus the sectional curvature of (S, \u03c3) is just (twice) the radial-radial (Coulomb) component\nof the electric part of the Weyl tensor, Eab := \u2212Cacbd uc ud . Inserting this result into Eq. (5.16)\nwe see that in this limit the IQE is precisely the coordinate-independent expression of the\nADM mass given by Ashtekar and Hansen [39].12\nOne more remark is in order here: Hayward's work on quasilocal energy [8] resembles\nwhat is done here in the sense that the Gauss embedding equation plays a central role, and\n12\n\nIn Ref. [39] a different definition of Eab is used, namely Eab = Cacbd nc nd , but accounting for this difference\nin notation the two results agree.\n\n24\n\n\fthat the analysis is boost invariant in spirit, i.e., no reference is made to a spacelike threesurface spanning S, with its attendant preferred time direction on S, and so on. However,\nHayward's quasilocal energy is distinct from the IQE here: it does not involve a square\nroot. Basically, Hayward starts with an integral over S of the '2+2' Hamiltonian density,\nwhich yields a dimensionless quantity, and then multiplies this quantity by the areal radius\nof S to correct this 'defect', i.e., give it the dimensions of energy. This is in the same spirit\nas the areal radius factor appearing in the Hawking mass [25]. For the large sphere limit\nat spatial infinity Hayward arrives at the same result given in Eq. (5.16), except with r\n'outside the integral', so to speak. His quasilocal energy has the very appealing feature\nof not requiring a reference subtraction term, at least when the sectional curvature \u03c3\u03c3R\nfalls off as 1/r 3 (however it diverges if, e.g., the spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspace-recall Eq. (4.5)). In our case, the square root in Eq. (4.2) ensures that the IQE has\nthe dimensions of energy, but the price paid is that a reference subtraction term is needed.\n(Without the square root the large sphere limit of the unreferenced IQE would just be\n(negative) the Euler number of S, which is finite, but carries no information about energy.)\nThe areal radius factor r in Eq. (5.16) appears 'inside the integral':\nq as mentioned before, it\narises from the dominant scalar curvature term R, and is really 2/R. I emphasize that\nthis is a geometrically natural mechanism-r is not put in by hand. Finally, while one might\nfeel that there is something unattractively ad hoc about a reference subtraction term, the\nflexibility it affords makes it possible to deal with the wide range of boundary conditions\npossible in general relativity. In Sec. 7 we will consider an interesting example of this.\n\n5.2\n\nThe null infinity limit\n\nWe now suppose that the physical spacetime (M, g) is asymptotically flat at future null\ninfinity. As in the previous subsection we begin with the generic large sphere form of the\nIQE given in Eq. (5.5), except now we take the large S limit in the future null direction.\nMore precisely, on M we introduce the Bondi coordinates [40] xa = (w, r, \u03b8, \u03c6), and as\nbefore, denote the subset (\u03b8, \u03c6) of spherical coordinates by xi . The retarded time w labels\na one-parameter family of outgoing null hypersurfaces, and r is an areal radius (luminosity\nparameter) along the outgoing null geodesic generators of these hypersurfaces. The w, r =\nconstant surfaces are topologically two-spheres, any one of which we denote as S. This setup\nis the same as discussed at the beginning of Sec. 5, where w here is what we there called the\n'time' coordinate, \u03c4 . We are interested in the one-parameter family of two-spheres S in the\nlimit as r \u2192 \u221e, with w arbitrary but fixed.\nIn the Bondi coordinates our asymptotically flat metric takes the standard form [41, 42]\ngab dxa dxb = \u2212UV dw 2 \u2212 2U dw dr + \u03c3ij (dxi + W i dw)(dxj + W j dw).\n\n(5.18)\n\nWe assume the following expansions for the various terms in this metric:13\n13\n\nV = 1 \u2212 2mr \u22121 + O< (r \u22121 ),\n\n(5.19)\n\nWe are following closely the notation used in Ref. [38], as well as the spirit of the discussion in their footnote\n2. The meaning of the notation O< (r\u2212n ) was described following Eq. (5.1). The motivation for this level\nof generality is that Chru\u015bciel et al [42] have recently shown that one can allow 'polyhomogeneous' terms of\nthe form r\u2212n lnm r in these expansions and still have a consistent framework for solving the Bondi-Sachs-type\n\n25\n\n\f1\nU = 1 \u2212 (X 2 + Y 2 )r \u22122 + O< (r \u22122 ),\n2\n\n(5.20)\n\nW \u03b8 = (2X cot \u03b8 + \u2202\u03b8 X + csc \u03b8\u2202\u03c6 Y )r \u22122 + O< (r \u22122 ),\nW \u03c6 = csc \u03b8 (2Y cot \u03b8 + \u2202\u03b8 Y \u2212 csc \u03b8\u2202\u03c6 X)r \u22122 + O< (r \u22122 ),\n\u03c3ij = r\n\n1\n0\n0 sin2 \u03b8\n\n2\n\n!\n\n+ 2r\n\nX\nY sin \u03b8\nY sin \u03b8 \u2212Xsin2 \u03b8\n\n!\n\n+ O< (r).\n\n(5.21)\n(5.22)\n\nThe function V contains the mass aspect, m(w, \u03b8, \u03c6). Observe that the metric on S is of\nthe same form given in Eq. (5.1) (with Z = \u2212X because r is an areal radius here), except\nnow X(w, \u03b8, \u03c6) and Y (w, \u03b8, \u03c6) have a significant physical interpretation: they are the real\nand imaginary parts of Sachs' complex asymptotic shear c = X + iY [41]. Thus the scalar\ncurvature of (S, \u03c3) will be given by Eq. (5.2), and we can begin our discussion of the IQE at\nEq. (5.5). Our first task is to compute the unreferenced shear term, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ).\nInspecting the metric in Eq. (5.18), we choose the following basis of one-forms:\n1\n1\ne\u2212 = U dw, e+ = dr + V dw, eI = \u03b3 Ii (dxi + W i dw),\n2\n2\n\n(5.23)\n\nwhere indices I, J, . . . take the values 2 and 3, and \u03b3 I i is defined by demanding that \u03c3ij =\n\u03b4IJ \u03b3 I i \u03b3 Jj . A suitable choice for \u03b3 I i is given by\nI\n\n\u03b3i=\n\nr+X\n0\n2Y\n(r \u2212 X) sin \u03b8\n\n!\n\n+ O< (1).\n\n(5.24)\n\nIn this matrix expression, I (i) is a row (column) index. Let the indices A, B, . . . take values\nin the set {\u2212, +, I}. Then the metric is given by gab = \u03b7AB eAa eBb , where\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03b7AB = \uf8ec\n\n0 \u22122 0 0\n\u22122 0 0 0\n0\n0 1 0\n0\n0 0 1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(5.25)\n\nThis matrix, and its inverse, \u03b7 AB , are used to raise and lower the the basis indices. The\nvector fields dual to the one-forms in Eq. (5.23) are given by eA a = \u03b7AB g ab eBb , or explicitly:\n2\n1\ne\u2212 =\n\u2202w \u2212 V \u2202r \u2212 W i \u2202i , e+ = \u2202r , eI = \u03b3I i \u2202i ,\nU\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhere \u03b3I i is defined by \u03b3I i = \u03b4IJ \u03c3 ij \u03b3 Jj , \u03c3 ij being the inverse of the matrix \u03c3ij .\nInspection of eI in Eq. (5.26) shows that these vectors are tangent to S, and so e\u00b1 are two\na\nnull normals to S. Since their normalization is such that e+ * e\u2212 = \u22122, we can set \u03be\u00b1\n= e\u00b1a ,\ncharacteristic initial value problem. Allowing only expansions in powers of inverse r is tantamount to Sachs'\n'outgoing radiation condition' [41], which they argue is overly restrictive. However, besides making the\ncalculations 'tighter' as regards remainder terms, and slightly more general, we would get the same results\nhad we assumed Sachs' outgoing radiation condition.\n\n26\n\n\fa\na\nwhere \u03be\u00b1\nwas previously defined by \u03be\u00b1\n:= ua \u00b1 na (see Eq. (3.8)). Thus, from Eqs. (2.8) we\nhave the following result, in basis components:\n\nlIJ \u00b1 kIJ = eI a eJb \u2207a e\u00b1b = \u2212\u03c9\u00b1JI ,\n\n(5.27)\n\nWorking out the required Ricci rotation coefficients14 I find\nlIJ + kIJ = BIJ , lIJ \u2212 kIJ\n\n2\nV\n=\nAIJ \u2212 BIJ \u2212 D(I WJ) ,\nU\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.28)\n\nwhere\nAIJ = \u03b3(I \u03b3\u0307J)i\n\n1\n=\nr\n\n\u1e8a \u1e8e\n\u1e8e \u2212\u1e8a\n\n\u2032\n\u03b3(I i \u03b3J)i\n\n1\n=\nr\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\ni\n\nBIJ =\n\n!\n\n!\n\n+ O< (r \u22121 ),\n\n1\n\u2212 2\nr\n\nX Y\nY \u2212X\n\n(5.29)\n!\n\n+ O< (r \u22122 ).\n\n(5.30)\n\nHere we use an overdot (prime) to denote differentiation with respect to w (r). Observe that\nD(I WJ) in Eq. (5.28) is of order 1/r 2. Taking the trace-free part of Eqs. (5.28) gives us the\nbasis components of the shears in the two null directions: s\u00b1 IJ =  \u0303lIJ \u00b1 k\u0303IJ . Explicitly:\ns+ IJ\n\n1\n=\u2212 2\nr\n\nX Y\nY \u2212X\n\n!\n\n\u22122\n\n+ O< (r ), s\u2212 IJ\n\n2\n=\nr\n\n\u1e8a \u1e8e\n\u1e8e \u2212\u1e8a\n\n!\n\n+ O< (r \u22121 ).\n\n(5.31)\n\nThus the unreferenced shear term in Eq. (5.5) is given by\n4\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) \u2261 \u2212s+ IJ s\u2212IJ = 3 (X \u1e8a + Y \u1e8e ) + O< (r \u22123 )\nr\n\n(5.32)\n\n(cf. Eq (4.9)).\nWe thus learn that, in contrast to the spatial infinity limit (see Eq. (5.12)), in the null\ninfinity limit the unreferenced shear term is of order 1/r 3, and so does contribute to the IQE.\nWe will argue below that the reference shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is also of order 1/r 3 , but that\nit is a total derivative and therefore does not contribute. So as not to interrupt the flow or\nour discussion, for the moment let us assume this is true, in which case Eq. (5.5) becomes\n1\nr\u2192\u221e 16\u03c0\n\nlim IQE = lim\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\nS\n\n\u0014\n\ndS r \u03c3\u03c3R \u2212\n\n4\n(X \u1e8a + Y \u1e8e ) .\nr3\n\u0015\n\n(5.33)\n\nBecause of the cc\u0304 \u0307 + \u010bc\u0304 = 2(X \u1e8a + Y \u1e8e ) term, this result looks like it could very well be the\nBondi-Sachs mass [41]. To see that in fact it is, a straightforward calculation of the Riemann\ntensor of gab projected into S gives the following sectional curvature of (S, \u03c3):\n\u03c3\u03c3R =\n14\n\n4\n(m + X \u1e8a + Y \u1e8e ) + O<(r \u22123).\nr3\n\nSee the footnote on page 23, with Z = \u00b1.\n\n27\n\n(5.34)\n\n\fInserting this result into Eq. (5.33) we see that the shear terms cancel, leaving only the mass\naspect, m:\nZ\n1\nd\u03a9 m(w, \u03b8, \u03c6).\n(5.35)\nlim IQE =\nr\u2192\u221e\n4\u03c0 S\nIn obtaining this expression, recall that because r is an areal radius we can (and did) take\n\u221a\n\u03c3 = r 2 sin \u03b8, and so dS = r 2 d\u03a9, where d\u03a9 = sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 is the measure on the unit round\nsphere.15 Thus the future null infinity limit of the IQE is the Bondi-Sachs mass [41].\nNow there is an important lesson to be learned from this result. The unreferenced shear\nterm (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) is solely responsible for producing the all-important cc\u0304 \u0307 + \u010bc\u0304 term that accounts\nfor the mass loss due to gravitational radiation. Hence this term is necessary under the\nsquare root in Eq. (4.2), and so there is no natural way to avoid (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref in IQEref , and\nits attendant embedding problem. Moreover, we learn that these shear terms are not only\nassociated with angular momentum, as I have been stressing, but also encode information\nabout gravitational radiation. We will see precisely the same phenomenon emerge in the\nsmall sphere limit in Sec. 6. Furthermore, it is emphasized in Ref. [43] that it is easy to\nconstruct, ab initio, an integral expression involving the Riemann tensor (e.g., an integral of\n\u03c3\u03c3R over S) that is conserved under certain circumstances. One is thus tempted to interpret\nsuch a conserved quantity as an energy. However, such attempts fail to produce, in the null\ninfinity limit, the crucial null-surface-dependent shear terms seen in Eq. (5.33), and it is\ndifficult to see how to modify them in a covariant way to produce these terms [43]. The\nshear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) is precisely such a covariant modification. Moreover, it arises\n\u221a naturally\nfrom simply replacing the Brown-York k with the boost invariant quantity k 2 \u2212 l2 . (Of\ncourse a similar observation can be made concerning, say, the Hawking mass [25], which has\nthe same large sphere limit as in Eq. (5.5), except without the reference shear term.)\nThese clean results rely on our assumption that the reference shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref does\nnot contribute to the null infinity limit of the IQE. I claimed above that this is so because it\nis a total derivative. To prove this would require solving the embedding equations (4.6-4.8),\nwhich we know is a very difficult task. However, I will now present a heuristic solution of\nthe Ricci equation that leads to a substantiation of this claim. Moreover, we will see how\ndemanding F ref = F plays a crucial role in achieving this result, which provides our first\nbit of indirect but concrete evidence that this condition is required to properly account for\nangular momentum (and as we now see, also gravitational radiation).\nTo begin we need to calculate the connection in the normal bundle, Aa , and then its\ncorresponding curvature, F . Proceeding as we did in the spatial infinity case (see Eq. (5.13))\nwe find that the basis components of Aa are given by\n1\n1\n1\nWI + eI (ln U),\nAI = \u03c9+\u2212I =\n2\nrU\n2\n\n(5.36)\n\nwhere eI (ln U) denotes the derivative of ln U along the vector field eI . This term is pure\ngauge. As for the other term, since we only know WI to leading order we can put U = 1\n15\n\nOn this note, it might be helpful to point out an important detail in the calculation of the sectional\ncurvature given in Eq. (5.34). One of the the terms that arises in the calculation is the trace of AIJ in\nEq. (5.29), which appears to be of order O< (r\u22121 ). If this were so it would be problematic. But in fact it is\nzero, because AI I = \u03b3I i \u03b3\u0307 I i = (1/2)\u03c3\u0307/\u03c3 = 0, since \u03c3 = r4 sin2 \u03b8 does not depend on w.\n\n28\n\n\fhere-see Eqs. (5.20) and (5.21). Thus, up to a gauge transformation, the connection oneform A is just (1/r times) the one-form Wi dxi . And the curvature is thus proportional to\nthe curl of W :\n2\n2\n(5.37)\nF = \u01ebIJ DI WJ = (D2 W3 \u2212 D3 W2 ).\nr\nr\nKeep in mind that the numerical indices here refer to basis components, not coordinate\ncomponents. It is easy to see that F is of order 1/r 3 . It is interesting to compare F with\nthe scalar curvature R, whose form was given in Eq. (5.2). Using the metric in Eq. (5.22) it\nis not difficult to evaluate the remainder term, \u2206R . The net result is [38]:\nR=\n\n2\n2\n+ D * W + O< (r \u22123 ),\n2\nr\nr\n\n(5.38)\n\nNote from Eq. (5.21) that W i is of order 1/r 2, so the term above involving W is, indeed,\nof order 1/r 3, as it should be. Thus we see that R is associated with the divergence of W ,\nand F with its curl. This is an explicit example of a point made earlier, namely that both\ncurvatures are on the same geometrical footing: To capture the two pieces of information in\nW -its divergence and its curl-requires precisely both R and F .\nLet us now turn to the null shears of S as they appear in the physical spacetime,\nEq. (5.31). The form of these shears suggests we make the following ansatz for the null\nshears of S in the reference (Minkowski) spacetime:\nsref\n+ IJ\n\n1\n= 2\nr\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1\n\n!\n\n\u22122\n\n+ O< (r ),\n\nsref\n\u2212 IJ\n\n1\n=\nr\n\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n\u03b4 \u2212\u03b3\n\n!\n\n+ O< (r \u22121 ).\n\n(5.39)\n\nObserve that we might expect the pair (\u03b1, \u03b2) to play a role distinct from the pair (\u03b3, \u03b4).\nComparing Eqs. (5.39) and (5.31) suggests that \u03b1 and \u03b2 will be like X and Y in that they\nhave something to do with the intrinsic geometry of (S, \u03c3). The 'more important' terms will\nbe \u03b3 and \u03b4, because they occur at the dominant power of inverse r. Also, we expect them to\nbe related to the extrinsic geometry of S, since their counterparts, \u1e8a and \u1e8e , measure how\n\u03c3ij changes as a function of the retarded time w-they are the two 'news' functions [41].\nWith these observations in mind, we will now 'solve' the Ricci embedding equation, (4.8).\nWe first compute (in basis components)\n2\n2\n1\nref J\n\u2212 \u01ebI J [sref\n+ , s\u2212 ] I = 3 (\u03b1\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3) = 3 det\n2\nr\nr\n\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(5.40)\n\nNext we impose the condition F ref = F , and observe that F in Eq. (5.37) can also be\nexpressed as a 'determinant', i.e.,\nF\n\nref\n\n2\n= F = det\nr\n\nD2 D3\nW2 W3\n\n!\n\n(5.41)\n\nThe Ricci embedding equation instructs us to equate the two previous determinant expressions. One solution is to make the identifications \u03b1 \u2194 rD2 and \u03b2 \u2194 rD3 (which are\nconsistent with our expectation that \u03b1 and \u03b2 be associated with intrinsic geometry), together with \u03b3 \u2194 rW2 and \u03b4 \u2194 rW3 (which are consistent with \u03b3 and \u03b4 being associated\n29\n\n\fwith extrinsic geometry, since W is proportional to the connection in the normal bundle-a\nmeasure of extrinsic geometry). Notice that this means sref\n+ IJ is a derivative operator! To\nmake this more palatable one may go to a 'Fourier transform space', where the derivative\noperators DI become momenta, KI . Accepting these heuristic identifications, and recalling\nEq. (4.9), the key point now is to observe that\n2\n2\n2\nI ref J\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref \u2261 \u2212sref\n+ J s\u2212 I = \u2212 3 (\u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b2\u03b4) = \u2212 (D2 W2 + D3 W3 ) = \u2212 D * W,\nr\nr\nr\n\n(5.42)\n\nthe result we desired: being a total derivative, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref does not contribute to the IQE.\nNow recall that the purpose of solving the embedding equations is to establish a relationship between F ref and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . It is via this relationship that we envision the angular\nmomentum information in F ref (= F ) to enter IQEref , which sees only (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . The\nprevious result implies the following relationship: F ref is the curl of W , and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is the\ndivergence of W . Hence, no relationship! Is this a problem? Certainly not. We require the\nrelationship in question only when different isometric embeddings of the same (S, \u03c3) result\nin a different (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref , making the IQE ambiguous. Such a relationship can be used to\nresolve this ambiguity by setting F ref = F . But accepting the argument that (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref\nis always a total derivative, any such ambiguity would be of no consequence here. Furthermore, in this simple case there is no need for (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref to carry any information about\nangular momentum (or gravitational radiation) coming from F , because all of the relevant\ninformation is already carried in the unreferenced shear term, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ). This is not to say\nthat the condition F ref = F is not important here. According to our heuristic argument, it\nis precisely this condition which ensures that (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is a total derivative, and so carries\nno information.\nThe null infinity limit is a simple case which only minimally exercises the consequences\nof the condition F ref = F . For (S, \u03c3) a finite two-surface the situation is much richer: it\nis highly nonlinear, since the square roots do not disappear, and almost certainly requires\neffectively a one-to-one relationship between F ref and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref to remove the embedding\nambiguity inherent in the IQE.\n\n6\n\nThe small sphere limit of the IQE\n\nHaving considered the large sphere case, we now turn our attention to evaluating the\nIQE when (S, \u03c3) is a small sphere. The large and small sphere limits are similar in that\nin both cases S approaches an asymptotically flat region of (M, g). In the latter case, the\nasymptotically flat region is the infinitesimal neighborhood of a generic spacetime point\np \u2208 M, which is the 'center' of our shrinking sphere. For simplicity we will suppose that\n(S, \u03c3) is asymptotically round. Another feature in common with the large sphere limit is\nthat in this codimension-two setting, the limit can be approached from different directions,\neither spatial or null. More precisely, fix a set of Riemann normal coordinates (t, xi ) about\nthe point p, set r 2 := \u03b4ij xi xj , and define S\u2217 by the condition (r, t) = (r\u2217 , \u03b1r\u2217 ), where \u03b1 is a\ndirection parameter. Then consider the limit of S\u2217 as r\u2217 \u2192 0. As before, we will henceforth\nomit the subscript '\u2217'. The case \u03b1 = 0 is a spatial limit, since then S always lies entirely in\n30\n\n\fthe t = 0 spacelike three-surface containing p. \u03b1 = \u00b11 is the null limit, in which S lies in\nthe future/past light cone of the point p. The latter case was considered by Horowitz and\nSchmidt [20] in their classic work on the small sphere limit of the Hawking mass. Brown,\nLau, and York [19] also consider this same limit of the Brown-York quasilocal energy. We\nwill be borrowing some results from these two references.\nExplicitly, for a given value of the parameter r, S is defined as a submanifold of (M, g)\nby embedding a topological two-sphere with coordinates \u03b8 and \u03c6 into the Riemann normal\ncoordinate system, as follows: t = \u03b1r, x1 = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, x2 = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, x3 = r cos \u03b8. Since\n(with t = \u03b1r) the deviation from the flat metric in Riemann normal coordinates is O(r 2 ),\nthe induced metric \u03c3ab on S will differ from that of the round sphere to this same order, and\nso the scalar curvature of (S, \u03c3) will have an expansion in r of the form\n2\n+ R(0) + rR(1) + r 2 R(2) + O(r 3),\nr2\n\nR=\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere each of the coefficients R(n) is a function of \u03b8, \u03c6, and the parameter \u03b1. To evaluate\nthe IQE we will also need similar expansions for the other quantities appearing in Eqs. (4.2)\nand (4.3). These are written as follows:\n\u03c3\u03c3R = \u03c3\u03c3R(0) + r \u03c3\u03c3R(1) + r 2 \u03c3\u03c3R(2) + O(r 3),\n\n(6.2)\n\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) = r 2 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) + O(r 3 ),\n\n(6.3)\n\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) = r 2 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) ref + O(r 3),\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere each of the coefficients on the right hand side is similarly a function of \u03b8, \u03c6, and\n\u03b1. Since the appropriate reference spacetime in this case is Minkowski space, we have\n\u03c3\u03c3Rref = 0. Substituting these expansions into Eq. (4.2) we find that in the small sphere\nlimit the unreferenced IQE behaves as\nunref\n\nIQE\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nr 2 h (0)\n2\n1+\n(R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R(0) ) + r(R(1) \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R(1) )\ndS\nr\n4\nS\n(\n\nZ\n\n+r\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\n\nR\n\n\u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R\n\n(2)\n\n(6.5)\n\n1\n+ (k\u0303 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) \u2212 (R(0) \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R(0) )2\n8\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n5\n\n\u001b\n\n+ O(r ) .\n\nSimilarly, the reference IQE behaves as\nref\n\nIQE\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\nr 2 h (0)\n2\n1+\nR + rR(1)\ndS\nr\n4\n(\n\n+r\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\n\nR\n\n1\n+ (k\u0303 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) ref \u2212 (R(0) )2\n8\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n5\n\n\u001b\n\n+ O(r ) .\n\n(6.6)\n\nNotice that, unlike in the large sphere limit, neither the unreferenced nor reference energies\ndiverge as r \u2192 0. Nevertheless, the reference subtraction procedure is still necessary to\neliminate the leading O(r) term in IQEunref , which has nothing to do with energy. Thus,\n\n31\n\n\fforming the difference of the previous two expressions we find that the small sphere behavior\nof the (referenced) IQE is given by\n1\n1 Z\ndS r \u03c3\u03c3R \u2212 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref + r 2 \u03c3\u03c3R(0) (\u03c3\u03c3R(0) \u2212 2R(0) ) + O(r 3) .\nIQE =\n16\u03c0 S\n8\n(6.7)\nThe sectional curvature and shear terms have been resummed according to Eqs. (6.2-6.4),\nand the resulting expression is valid to the order indicated. Notice that, as in the large sphere\nlimit, the scalar curvature q\nR dominates the other terms under the square root, allowing us to\nexpand the radical about 4/r 2 = 2/r.16 And after the reference subtraction is performed\nwhat remains again is the sectional curvature of (S, \u03c3) as the dominant term contributing to\nthe energy. Comparing Eqs. (6.7) and (5.5) we observe that both the small and large sphere\nlimits of the IQE are very nearly formally identical.\nWe will split the IQE into three pieces, each to be discussed separately: IQE = IQE1 +\nIQE2 + IQE3 + O(r 6), where\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nh\ni\n1\nIQE1 =\ndS r \u03c3\u03c3R \u2212 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) ,\n16\u03c0 S\nh\ni\n1 Z\nIQE2 =\ndS r 3 \u03c3\u03c3R(0) (\u03c3\u03c3R(0) \u2212 2R(0) ) ,\n128\u03c0 S\nZ\ni\nh\n1\ndS r (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref .\nIQE3 =\n16\u03c0 S\nZ\n\n(6.8)\n(6.9)\n(6.10)\n\nWe begin with IQE1 , and show that this piece is essentially the Hawking mass [25]. To see\nthis, we combine Eqs. (4.1) and (2.10) to get\n1\n\u03c3\u03c3R \u2212 (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) = R \u2212 (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) = R \u2212 2H * H.\n2\n\n(6.11)\n\nReplacing the integrand of IQE1 with the last expression, and using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to integrate the R term, we find\n1\nIQE1 =\n4\u03c0\n\ns\n\nA\n1Z\n2\u03c0 \u2212\ndS H * H ,\n4\u03c0\n2 S\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(6.12)\n\nq\n\nwhere we pulled r outside the integral and replaced it with A/(4\u03c0), where A is the area of\n(S, \u03c3). This form of IQE1 is precisely the expression of the Hawking mass given in Ref. [20].\n(Our H c in Eq. (2.10) is their N c /2, and the sign of their metric signature is opposite to ours.)\nComparing Eq. (6.12) with Eqs. (3.7)\n\u221a and (3.9) we observe that, while the unreferenced IQE\ninvolves the mean curvature itself, H * H, the Hawking mass is\u221aconstructed from the square\nof the mean curvature. As mentioned above, the square root in H * H effectively disappears\nin the small (and large) sphere limits due to the presence of the dominant scalar curvature\n16\n\nAs remarked in the footnote on page 22, if the sphere is not asymptotically round the shear terms will\ncontribute at order 1/r2 , and the 2/r term outside the braces in Eqs. (6.5) and (6.6) will be modified\naccordingly. We will not consider this more complicated case here.\n\n32\n\n\fterm, and consequently the leading order contribution to the IQE reduces to essentially the\nHawking mass.\nq\nThere are two subtleties worth mentioning: (i) Replacing r with A/(4\u03c0) is in general\nnot valid because it requires that r be an areal radius which, in general, it is not. However,\nit certainly is to lowest order in r, which will be sufficient for our purposes here. But to\nhigher order, IQE1 and the Hawking mass will in general give different results. (ii) It is well\nknown that the Hawking mass runs into difficulties when (S, \u03c3) is not a round sphere [8, 20],\na problem that was addressed by Hayward inqRef. [8]. It might be that this problem is a\nresult of having to insert by hand the factor A/(4\u03c0) outside the integral, versus having r\nq\n\n'inside the integral' generated automatically by 2/R. A related issue was discussed at the\nend of Sec. 5.1 in connection with Hayward's definition of quasilocal energy.\nThe connection between IQE1 and the Hawking mass allows us to borrow some results\nfrom Ref. [20], which are calculated for the null limit case (\u03b1 = 1). When matter is present\nHorowitz and Schmidt find that, to lowest order in r, the Hawking mass is\n4 3\nmat a b\nIQE1 =\nu u |p + O(r 4).\n\u03c0r Tab\n3\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(6.13)\n\nmat\nHere Tab\nis the energy-momentum tensor of matter, and the expression is to be evaluated\nat the point p, where the unit timelike vector ua is just (\u2202/\u2202t)a in our Riemann normal\ncoordinates. This is a standard result in the literature on quasilocal energy [19, 20, 21, 22,\n23, 24], and a very significant one. As emphasized in the Introduction, the quasilocal idea\nasserts that the time-time component of the energy-momentum tensor of matter a priori has\nnothing to do with energy. It is only from the small sphere limit of the quasilocal energy that\nwe learn this quantity is an energy volume density, i.e., multiplying it by the volume factor\n4\u03c0r 3 /3 gives the energy in an infinitesimal sphere of proper radius r. However, integrating\nthis energy volume density over a finite volume to determine the total energy inside is not,\nin general, valid unless one wishes to ignore gravitational effects which, as we will see in\nmoment, come at higher order in r.17 It is in this sense that the quasilocal idea implies that\neven energy due to matter is not localizable in the context of general relativity.\nNow let us assume the spacetime is vacuum in the neighborhood of p. Then the leading\norder contribution to the Hawking mass is [20]\n\nIQE1 =\n\n1 5\nr Tabcd ua ub uc ud |p + O(r 6),\n90\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhere Tabcd is the Bel-Robinson tensor [45]. Thus gravitational energy begins to appear at\nO(r 5). This same result is obtained for the Brown-York quasilocal energy for a suitable choice\nof reference embedding [19]. However, this is not a universal result in the literature [21, 22,\n23,24]. For example, Hayward's quasilocal mass gives a similar result as above, but with the\n17\n\nA well established example of this phenomenon is the Tolman density, which integrates to the Komar mass,\nand is defined in the special case that the spacetime is stationary and asymptotically flat [1]. It is noteworthy\nthat it is not Tab that appears in the Tolman density, but rather the combination Tab \u2212 (1/2)T gab. The extra\nterm involving the trace of Tab is associated with gravitational effects-see Ref. [44], and problems 4 and 5\nin Chapter 11 of Ref. [1].\n\n33\n\n\fnumerical factor 1/90 replaced with \u22122/45 [22]. Given that gravitational energy is such a\ndifficult problem it is not surprising that a consensus has not yet been reached.\nWe now turn our attention to the second contribution to the IQE, namely IQE2 given\nin Eq. (6.9). This quantity represents a deviation from the Hawking mass due to the fact\nthat the IQE is roughly the square root of the former. Actually, it is clearer to compare\nwith the Brown-York quasilocal\nenergy, since in constructing the IQE we simply replaced\n\u221a\n2\n2\nthe Brown-York k with k \u2212 l . In the context of our generalization given in Eq. (3.4), we\ntherefore have the heuristic comparison:\nm=\n\nl2\n1\u221a 2\np~ 2\n1\nk\u2212\n\u2212 * * * \u2212\u2192\n\u2212*** .\nE 2 \u2212 p~ 2 = E \u2212\nk \u2212 l2 =\n2E\n8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n2k\n!\n\nq\n\n(6.15)\n\nSo IQE2 might be thought of as the analogue of the term \u2212l2 /(2k), and as such would be\nexpected to reduce the magnitude of the IQE from the result given in Eq. (6.14).\nIn order to calculate IQE2 we need to evaluate the quantities R(0) and \u03c3\u03c3R(0) in Eq. (6.9).\nTo do so we appeal to the Gauss equation, (4.1). Up to zeroth order in r, this equation reads\n\u03c3\u03c3R(0) =\n\n2\n1\n+ R(0) \u2212 (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) + O(r),\n2\nr\n2\n\n(6.16)\n\nwhere we made use of Eq. (6.1). We will show later that\n(k 2 \u2212 l2 ) =\n\n4\n4\n+ (1 + 2\u03b12 )Eab na nb + O(r),\n2\nr\n3\n\n(6.17)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the direction parameter introduced at the beginning of this section. Eab na nb is\nthe radial-radial component of the electric part of the Weyl tensor, which we saw earlier\nin Eq. (5.17). This quantity (Eab na nb ) is to be evaluated at the point p, where in our\nRiemann normal coordinates the radial unit vector na has only spatial components, given\nby ni = xi /r. We also need dS to lowest order, which is just r 2 d\u03a9, d\u03a9 being the measure\non the unit sphere. Putting these results together we have\nIQE2 = \u2212\n\n1\n(5 + 4\u03b12 )r 5 Eij Ekl\n96\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a9 ni nj nk nl .\n\n(6.18)\n\nBy symmetry, the integral over the product of radial vectors must be proportional to \u03b4 (ij \u03b4 kl) .\nTransvecting both this term and the integral in question with \u03b4ij \u03b4kl , we easily obtain that\nthe proportionality constant is 4\u03c0/5. Using the fact that Eab is symmetric, trace-free, and\northogonal to ua , we find that\nIQE2 = \u2212\n\n1\n(5 + 4\u03b12 )r 5 Eab E ab .\n180\n\n(6.19)\n\nSo IQE2 is negative, as expected, and this negative contribution is to be added to IQE1 in\nEq. (6.14). Of course we can only consider the \u03b1 = 1 case, since this is the case assumed in\nEq. (6.14). Recall that the time component of the Bel-Robinson tensor can be expressed in\nterms of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor [45]: Tabcd ua ubuc ud = Eab E ab +\n34\n\n\fBab B ab , so IQE1 is nonnegative. Inspection of Eq. (6.19) shows that adding to IQE1 the \u03b1 = 1\nvalue of IQE2 makes the energy have indefinite sign. It is positive (negative) if the magnetic\n(electric) part dominates. This seems like a strange result, but it is only an intermediate\nresult. We have not yet considered the last contribution, IQE3 , involving the reference shear\nterm. But unfortunately at present I do not know how to solve the embedding equations to\ndetermine this term.\nNow one can construct a heuristic argument much like the one given at the end of Sec. 5.2,\nwhich suggests that (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref is a total derivative, and so does not contribute. However,\nthe argument is much less believable in this case. In contrast to Eq. (5.39) it turns out that,\nbecause F is O(1) in r (as we shall see later), we must expand the reference shears sref\n\u00b1 over\nthree orders of magnitude in r, from O(1) to O(r 2). One might trust a heuristic argument\nworking to leading order, but believing the higher order corrections is less palatable. In\nshort, I do not know what energy prediction the IQE gives at O(r 5 ), and until a solution to\nthe embedding equations is found there is no sense in speculating.\nHowever, before leaving this section I will provide an intriguing interpretation of how a\ndefinition of quasilocal energy such as the Hawking mass (or the IQE) provides a measure\nof the gravitational energy contained inside a small sphere.\nIn the \u03b1 = 1 null limit case, the lowest order contribution to the gravitational energy,\nnamely (1/90)r 5 Tabcd ua ub uc ud |p in Eq. (6.14), originates in the O(r 2) terms inside the brackets of the integrand of IQE1 in Eq. (6.8). In the terminology of Eqs. (6.2) and (6.3), this\nmeans we are interested in the coefficients \u03c3\u03c3R(2) and (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) . Inspecting the Appendix\nof Ref. [19] reveals that these two coefficients differ only by a numerical factor. They are\nboth proportional to \u03a80 \u03a8\u03040 |p (in Newman-Penrose notation), and the two numerical factors\nconspire to produce the 1/90 factor in the final result. Thus, to understand how the integrand of IQE1 encodes information about gravitational energy it suffices to study the shear\nterm, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) . We will now compute this term for arbitrary \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] to see how it\nbehaves in both the spatial and null limit cases of the small sphere.\nDenoting our Riemann normal coordinates (t, xi ) collectively as xa , the metric in these\ncoordinates take the form\n1\ngab = \u03b7ab \u2212 Jabcd xc xd + O(x3 ),\n3\n\n(6.20)\n\nwhere Jabcd = (Racbd + Radbc )/2 is the Jacobi curvature tensor [29]. We first construct a\npair of mutually orthogonal unit normal vector fields ua and na on S, with ua normal to the\nt = constant surface passing through S. These are given by\nu0 =\n\n1\n1\n, ui = \u2212 r 2 \u03b2 i0 + O(r 3), u0 = \u2212N, ui = 0,\nN\n3\n\n(6.21)\n\n1\nxj\nxi\nxi 1 2 ij xj\nn = 0, n = \u03c1\n+ r \u03b2\n+ O(r 3) , n0 = \u2212 r 2 \u03b20j + O(r 3), ni = \u03c1 ,(6.22)\nr\n3\nr\n3\nr\nr\n0\n\ni\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nwhere\n1\nN = 1 + r 2 \u03b200 + O(r 3),\n6\n35\n\n(6.23)\n\n\f1 2 xi xj\n\u03c1 = 1 \u2212 r \u03b2ij 2 + O(r 3 ),\n6\nr\n\n(6.24)\n\nxi xj\nxj\n+ Jabij 2 .\n(6.25)\nr\nr\nSince the Jacobi tensor in Eq (6.20) is evaluated at the coordinate origin p, its indices,\nand thus those of \u03b2ab , are raised and lowered with the flat spacetime metric \u03b7ab = \u03b7 ab =\ndiagonal(\u22121, 1, 1, 1). Similarly, xi := \u03b4ij xj .\nNow define on S a pair of mutually orthogonal unit tangent vector fields eI a , where\nindices I, J, . . . take the values 2 and 3. The set {e0 a := ua , e1 a := na , eI a } thus comprises\nan orthonormal basis adapted to S. Let basis indices A, B, . . . run from 0 to 3, and \u03b1, \u03b2, . . .\nfrom 1 to 3. Beginning with this setup it is straightforward to compute the basis components\nof the extrinsic curvatures defined in Eqs. (2.8). I find:\n2\nlIJ = eI a eJb \u2207a ub = \u2212 r[\u03b1J00IJ + J01IJ ] + O(r 2),\n(6.26)\n3\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n1\n2\na b\n(6.27)\nkIJ = eI eJ \u2207a nb = \u03b4IJ \u2212 r J11IJ \u2212 \u03b1 J00IJ \u2212 J0011 \u03b4IJ + O(r 2).\nr\n3\n2\nIn these equations a quantity such as J01IJ means [e0 a e1 b eI c eJd Jabcd ]|p , which is a function of\nonly the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 on S.\nSince we are interested in purely gravitational energy we shall restrict ourselves to the\nvacuum case. In our basis components the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor\nare defined by [46]:\nE\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212C0\u03b10\u03b2 and B\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u2217C0\u03b10\u03b2 ,\n(6.28)\n\u03b2ab = \u03b12 Jab00 + 2\u03b1Jab0j\n\nwhere \u2217CABCD = (1/2)\u01ebAB EF CEF CD . These are symmetric trace-free three-dimensional\ntensors associated with t = constant spacelike hypersurfaces. As such, each has five independent components, which together comprise the ten independent components of the Weyl\ntensor. In terms of these fields, the components of the Jacobi curvature tensor relevant to\nEqs. (6.26-6.27) read:\nJ0011 = \u2212E11 , J00IJ = \u2212EIJ , J01IJ = \u2212\u2217B\u0303IJ , J11IJ = \u2212EIJ \u2212 E11 \u03b4IJ .\n\n(6.29)\n\nHere B\u0303IJ is the trace-free part of BIJ , and \u2217B\u0303IJ = \u01ebI K B\u0303KJ is its dual in (S, \u03c3), which is\nalso trace-free. The trace of EIJ is \u03b4 IJ EIJ = \u03b4 \u03b1\u03b2 E\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 E11 = \u2212E11 , since E\u03b1\u03b2 is trace-free.\nThus, the trace of the extrinsic curvatures in Eqs.

(6.17) written earlier. The trace-free\nparts are\n \u0303lIJ = 2 r(\u03b1\u1ebcIJ + \u2217B\u0303IJ ) + O(r 2),\n(6.32)\n3\n1\nk\u0303IJ = r(1 \u2212 \u03b12 )\u1ebcIJ + O(r 2).\n(6.33)\n3\n36\n\n\fNow \u1ebcIJ and B\u0303IJ each have two independent components, and it is useful to introduce the\nnotation\n\u1ebcIJ =\nB\u0303IJ =\n\n1\n(E22\n2\n\n!\n\n1\n(B22\n2\n\n!\n\n\u2212 E33 )\nE23\n1\nE23\n\u2212 2 (E22 \u2212 E33 )\n\u2212 B33 )\nB23\nB23\n\u2212 12 (B22 \u2212 B33 )\n\n=:\n\ne2 e3\ne3 \u2212e2\n\n!\n\nb2 b3\nb3 \u2212b2\n\n=: \u2212\n\n,\n!\n\n(6.34)\n,\n\n(6.35)\n\nand thus define a pair of two-vectors ~e := eI eI a and ~b := bI eI a tangent to S. Since ~e and\n~b represent the pullbacks to S of E\u03b1\u03b2 and B\u03b1\u03b2 , respectively, they are to be thought of as\n'electric and magnetic fields' induced on S by the Weyl curvature that S is embedded in. It is\neasy to see that under a rotation of the basis vectors eI a through an angle \u03b3, the components\nof ~e and ~b rotate through an angle 2\u03b3, so ~e and ~b are not true (spin one) vectors, but rather\nspin two objects, as one would expect.\nThus we arrive at the results we are interested in. To lowest order in r we have\n \u0303l2 = 4 r 2 (\u03b1\u1ebc + \u2217B\u0303)2 = 8 r 2 (\u03b12~e * ~e + ~b * ~b \u2212 2\u03b1~e \u00d7 ~b),\n9\n9\n1\n2\nk\u0303 2 = r 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 \u1ebc 2 = r 2 (1 \u2212 \u03b12 )2~e * ~e.\n9\n9\n\n(6.36)\n(6.37)\n\nThe difference of these two gives the O(r 2) piece of the unreferenced shear term appearing\nin the integrand of IQE1 in Eq. (6.8). Notice that it is the appearance of \u2217B\u0303IJ (rather than\nB\u0303IJ ) that gives rise to the cross product term ~e \u00d7 ~b = e2 b3 \u2212 e3 b2 in Eq. (6.36).\nWe first consider the case \u03b1 = 1, in which S lies in the future light cone of the point p.\nThen k\u0303 2 = 0 and so the shear term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ) is proportional to r 2 (\u1ebc +\u2217B\u0303)2 . As a quick check,\nit is easy to verify that (\u1ebc + \u2217B\u0303)2 , in turn, is proportional to \u03a80 \u03a8\u03040 |p , in agreement with\nRef. [19]. I mentioned above that in this case the \u03c3\u03c3R term in Eq. (6.8) also contributes a\nterm proportional to r 2 \u03a80 \u03a8\u03040 |p [19]. Putting in the numerical factors I find that\nIQE1 =\n\nZ\n\nS\n\n1\nr3 1\n(~e * ~e + ~b * ~b) \u2212 ~e \u00d7 ~b + O(r 6).\ndS\n9 8\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(6.38)\n\nNow (~e * ~e + ~b * ~b)/(8\u03c0) looks like the energy surface density of the 'electromagnetic field',\nbut we must be careful about its dimension. (~e * ~e + ~b * ~b)/(8\u03c0) has dimension L\u22124 , where L\nmeans 'length', which is not correct. However, the additional factor of r 3 /9 in the integrand\nsuggests that it is really E := r 3 (~e * ~e + ~b * ~b)/(72\u03c0) that is the proper energy density. E\nhas dimension L\u22121 , consistent with it being interpreted as the 'electromagnetic' energy\nper\nR\nunit area of S. Besides giving the right dimension, the additional r 3 factor forces S dS E\nto go to zero as r 5 , consistent\nwith the fact that there can be no gravitational energy at\nR\n3\norder r . We interpret S dS E as the total 'electromagnetic' energy that was in S at t = 0,\nor equivalently, the total gravitational energy that was in the small volume spanning S at\nt = 0.\nTo further justify this interpretation we now turn to the radiation term in Eq. (6.38).\nClearly ~e \u00d7 ~b/(4\u03c0) might be thought of as the gravitational analogue of the electromagnetic\n37\n\n\fPoynting flux, directed radially outward from S. But again, its dimension is wrong. Of\ncourse the factor of r 3 /9 will fix this problem, as before, but the situation is more interesting\nthis time. Multiplying by r 2 /9 we get the proper Poynting flux, P := r 2~e \u00d7 ~b/(36\u03c0). P\nhas dimension L\u22122 , consistent with interpreting it as the 'electromagnetic' energy per unit\nR\ntime per unit area. So S dS P gives the 'electromagnetic' energy per unit time radiating\nfrom (or through) the surface S. The factor of r 2 indicates that the efficiency of a small\nvolume to radiate gravitationally grows in proportion to its surface area, in analogy with\nan electromagnetic antenna. But there is one\nq more factor of r, which one might imagine is\nthe r outside the brackets in Eq. (6.8), i.e., 2/R. This distinction between rs is suggested\nby the close analogy between P and the shear term responsible for radiation in the null\ninfinity limit-seeR Eqs. (5.32-5.33). This additional factor of r has the interpretation of a\ntime lapse, i.e., r S dS P is the amount of 'electromagnetic' energy radiated from S between\ntime t = 0 and t = r. Thus, the following picture has emerged regarding Eq. (6.38).\nThe 'electromagnetic' energy in S (or equivalently, the gravitational energy in the volume\nspanning S) at time t = r is the energy at t = 0 minus the amount of energy radiated during\nthis time interval. (Keep in mind that ~e and ~b are evaluated at p, and hence at t = 0.)\nThe case \u03b1 = \u22121 is similar, except now S lies in the past light cone of the point p.\nInspection of Eq. (6.36) reveals that the radiation term in Eq. (6.38) now appears with the\nopposite sign. The fact that this sign change comes out correctly is reassurance that our\npicture is correct: The energy at time t = \u2212r is the energy at t = 0 plus the amount of\nenergy that will be radiated from the sphere during the interval from t = \u2212r to t = 0.18\nFinally, we consider the spatial limit case, \u03b1 = 0. According to our discussion above we\nwould expect IQE1 to be the same as in Eq. (6.38), except with the radiation term absent.\nInspection of Eqs. (6.36-6.37) reveals that this is not the case. However, it is only when \u03b1 = 1\n(and presumably also when \u03b1 = \u22121) that we know that \u03c3\u03c3R(2) in Eq. (6.8) is proportional\nto (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )(2) , in which case it suffices to consider only the shear term. Unfortunately, it is\nnot possible to compute \u03c3\u03c3R to O(r 2) within the framework of our O(r 2) Riemann normal\ncoordinates, so we cannot learn if this simple proportionality between the two persists when\n|\u03b1| < 1. One might guess that it almost certainly does not, but I will leave this question for\nfuture work. Nevertheless, since we expect  \u0303l2 to play the key role with regards to radiation,\nEq. (6.36) is still of some qualitative value when |\u03b1| < 1. From this equation we see that the\nradiation term is zero when \u03b1 is zero, and turns on in proportion to \u03b1, precisely as it should\nsince the time lapse is now \u03b1r, instead of r.\nAs satisfying as it might seem, the picture just given is not truly quasilocal, in the sense\nthat ~e and ~b are evaluated at the point p. To be truly quasilocal we need 'electromagnetic'\n~ and B,\n~ evaluated on S. This is where observers reside, and measurefields, call them E\nments are made, according to the quasilocal idea. Such a quasilocal picture is achieved very\nThe reader may have noticed that ~b in Eq. (6.35) was defined with an awkward minus sign. This sign was\nchosen to give the picture just described. Reversing the sign is equivalent to replacing \u03b1 with \u2212\u03b1. Insofar\n~ and B\n~ in electromagnetism) are defined by their physical interpretation, choosing the sign\nas ~e and ~b (like E\n~\nof b to give a result with the correct interpretation is legitimate. But this assumes we know what the correct\ninterpretation is, and it is not certain we do. For example, I mentioned above that at O(r5 ) Hayward's\nquasilocal energy gives a negative gravitational energy [22]. If this is correct, then we should replace the\ndefinition of ~b with \u2212~b.\n18\n\n38\n\n\fnaturally as follows. The basic idea is: ~e and ~b are certain components of the Weyl tensor\nevaluated at p (r = 0). But this information is contained in the O(r) piece of certain con~ and B\n~ fields to\nnection coefficients evaluated on S (r > 0). Thus we expect the desired E\nbe associated with connection coefficients.\nFor simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the case \u03b1 = 1, which also allows us to borrow\nsome results from Ref. [19]. We first observe that\n\u03a80 |p = \u22122[(e2 \u2212 b3 ) + i(e3 + b2 )].\n\n(6.39)\n\nOn the left hand side is a component of the Weyl tensor in Newman-Penrose (NP) notation.\nUsing Eqs. (6.28) and (6.34-6.35), \u03a80 is easily converted to the expression given on the right\nhand side. From Eq. (B5b) of Ref. [19] we have\nr\n\u03c3 = \u03a80 |p + O(r 2),\n3\n\n(6.40)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is one of the NP spin coefficients. Thus we find that\nr2\n1\n\u03c3\u03c3\u0304 = [~e * ~e + ~b * ~b \u2212 2~e \u00d7 ~b] + O(r 3).\n4\n9\n\n(6.41)\n\nComparing this with the integrand in Eq.

There are both local and global dimensions to this result. Locally, F is associated\nwith frame dragging, a ready example being F for the Kerr black hole given in Eq. (5.15),\nwhich is proportional to the angular momentum. Globally, it is known that in exact analogy\nwith the scalar curvature R, the integral of F over S is proportional to the Euler number of\nthe normal bundle [27]. For a Euclidean-signature spacetime the normal bundle is an SO(2)\n(rather than SO(1, 1)) bundle, and there can be a nontrivial winding number, corresponding\nto a gravitational magnetic monopole. In the case of the Kerr spacetime there is no monopole\npresent since, as is obvious from inspection of Eq. (5.15), the integral of F is zero. It might\nbe interesting to explore topologically nontrivial cases in the context of the IQE.\nThe result in Eq. (6.46) can actually be obtained immediately by inspection of Eq. (2.16),\nassuming that the shear terms are higher order in r than F is. To lowest order in r we then\nsee that F = \u22122R0123 . But R0123 = C0123 is identically true, and thus we are led to Eq. (6.46).\nSo this equation is true whether or not matter is present, and is also independent of \u03b1. It is\ninstructive to compare this result with the sectional curvature of S in vacuo:\n\u03c3\u03c3R = 2E11 + O(r).\n\n(6.47)\n\nThis is essentially the same as the spatial infinity limit result given in Eq. (5.17), and is\nderived similarly. Comparing the previous two equations we see a striking electric/magnetic\nduality between the sectional curvature of S (electric), and the curvature of its normal\nbundle (magnetic). When matter is present, the right hand side of the equation above\nacquires an additional term, and it is precisely this term that is responsible for the O(r 3)\nmatter contribution seen in Eq. (6.13). So the sectional curvature is the dominant term in\nthe energy that encodes information about the matter content of the spacetime. It seems\nreasonable to expect inertial effects (frame dragging) produced by this matter to also play\na role in the energy. But consideration of such effects is subtle, because the magnetic part\nof the Weyl tensor has no Newtonian gravity analogue. I have argued that the procedure\nsuggested in Sec. 4 is a geometrically natural way to incorporate such inertial effects into the\nenergy: one demands F ref = F , and then solves the embedding equations for the reference\nshear term, present in the reference energy. In this way the inertia information contained\nin F makes its presence felt in the energy. Moreover, by inspection of the purely spatial\n(\u03b1 = 0) case of Eq. (6.45), one observes that the set of magnetic quantities: F , A, and ~b,\nprecisely encode the five independent components of the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor.\nIt seems likely that the phenomenon of gravitational energy is subtle enough to be sensitive\nto this full set. Out of this set, in this section we have seen only the role of ~b. To see whether\nor not the other components play a role (via (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref ) will have to wait until a solution\nto the embedding equations is found.\n\n7\n\nAsymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes\n\nIn this last section we will explore the significance of the \u03c3\u03c3Rref term in Eq. (4.3).\nSuppose our physical spacetime (M, g) is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The \u03c3\u03c3Rref\n40\n\n\fterm in IQEref gives us the freedom to specify the Riemann tensor of a reference spacetime,\nwhich in this case is naturally the Riemann tensor of anti-de Sitter space. Thus, according\nto Eq. (4.5) we have \u03c3\u03c3Rref = \u22122/l2 , and so\nref\n\nIQE\n\n1\n=\u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\ns \u0014\n\n2\n\n2\n+ R + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref .\nl2\n\u0015\n\n(7.1)\n\nIn the large sphere limit it is clear that the cosmological constant term will dominate, rather\nthan R, and the behavior of the IQE is qualitatively different from that for asymptotically\nflat spacetimes.\nLet us now specialize to the case that (M, g) is the AdS4 -Schwarzschild spacetime, so that\nour main argument is not obscured by consideration of the shear terms, which will obviously\nbe just zero. The line element in this case is given by\n1\nds = \u2212N dt + 2 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 ,\nf\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nwhere N(r) = f (r) =\n\n2M\nr2\n+1\u2212\n2\nl\nr\n\n!1\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(7.2)\n\nand d\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 is the line element on the unit round sphere. Let S be a t, r =\nconstant two-sphere. Its scalar curvature is R = 2/r 2 , and a simple calculation shows that\nits sectional curvature is given by\n\u03c3\u03c3R = \u2212\n\n2\n4M\n+\n,\nl2\nr3\n\n(7.3)\n\nthe dominant term coming from the anti-de Sitter 'background'. Substituting these results\ninto Eqs. (4.2) and (7.1) we find\n1\nIQE = \u2212\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\ns \u0014\n\n2\n4M\n1\n2\n2 2+ 2\u2212 3 +\nl\nr\nr\n8\u03c0\n\u0015\n\nZ\n\nS\n\ndS\n\ns \u0014\n\n2\n\n2\nMl\n1\n2\n+\n=\n+\nO\n. (7.4)\nl2 r 2\nr\nr3\n\u0015\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nThe divergent terms due to the cosmological constant cancel, so the limit of the IQE as\nr \u2192 \u221e exists, and this limit is zero. This would be the expected result if the IQE had the\ninterpretation of an energy, which should be red shifted to zero by the cosmological horizon.\nIn contrast, we do not expect an invariant mass to be redshifted. This is why the terminology\n'invariant quasilocal energy' was chosen rather than 'invariant\u221aquasilocal mass', even though\nthe IQE is the analogue of the mass m in the formula: m = E 2 \u2212 p~ 2 .\nHowever, one can easily modify the definition of the IQE-to give it the interpretation of\nmass-by multiplying the right hand side of Eq. (3.4) by a lapse function. Thus one replaces\nEq. (4.2) with\nIQE[NB ] = \u2212\n\n1\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\nq\n\ndS NB 2 [R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3R] +\n\n1\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nS\n\nq\n\ndS NBref 2 [R \u2212 \u03c3\u03c3Rref ]\n\n(7.5)\n\n(ignoring the shear terms). Here the smearing function, NB , is the lapse function in the\ntimelike three-boundary, B, swept out by the two-parameter family of observers (cf. Eqs. (11)\nand (13) in Ref. [36]). In the AdS4 -Schwarzschild example B is an r = constant surface, and\n41\n\n\fNB = N. The question arises, What are we to put for NBref ? The answer that works is\nNBref = NB , which is intuitively justified as follows: we are already isometrically embedding\n(S, \u03c3) into (M ref , g ref ), and the condition NBref = NB represents the next would-be step\ntowards an isometric embedding of (B, \u03b3) into (M ref , g ref ), where \u03b3ab is the three-metric in\nB. ('Would-be' in the sense that, while the lapse carries some information about \u03b3ab , we\nstill only need to embed (S, \u03c3) into (M ref , g ref ), not (B, \u03b3) into (M ref , g ref ).) By comparing\nEq. (7.5) with (7.4), and using the fact that the lapse function goes as r/l for large r, it is\neasy to see that with NBref = NB we get limr\u2192\u221e IQE[NB ] = M for the AdS4 -Schwarzschild\ncase. Thus IQE[NB ] has the interpretation of a mass, as claimed. Unlike the original IQE, it\nis not red shifted to zero, and is thus a different physical quantity. Regarding the comment\nat the end of the previous paragraph, since special relativity does not know about lapse\nfunctions, the generalization given in Eq. (3.4) is open to this ambiguity: one can define\nboth an invariant quasilocal energy and an 'invariant' quasilocal mass.\nIt is instructive to evaluate IQE[NB ] also at the horizon, r = r+ (where NB (r+ ) = 0),\nand compare with what one gets using the unsmeared IQE. The following results for the\nAdS4 -Schwarzschild example are easily established:\n( \u221a\n2Mr+ at r = r+\n(7.6)\nIQE =\n0\nat r = \u221e\nIQE[NB ] =\n\n(\n\n0 at r = r+\nM at r = \u221e\n\n(7.7)\n\nWe thus learn that the IQE decreases with r, which can be interpreted as the result of\nnegative binding energy-another reason to think of the IQE as an energy. On the other\nhand, IQE[NB ] increases with r, which might be interpreted as saying that, for larger r,\n'more mass is enclosed'; it starts from zero at the horizon (no mass in the interior of the\nblack hole) and accumulates to M at infinity. This is reminiscent of the old notion that the\nsubstance of mass is nothing but the curvature of spacetime itself. A similar behavior is\nobserved for the usual Schwarzschild case:\nIQE =\n\n(\n\n2M at r = 2M\nM at r = \u221e\n\n(7.8)\n\nIQE[NB ] =\n\n(\n\n0 at r = 2M\nM at r = \u221e\n\n(7.9)\n\nThe only qualitative difference occurs at r = \u221e, where IQE[NB ] = IQE in the Schwarzschild\ncase because, of course, the lapse function goes to one in this limit. There is no cosmological\nhorizon.\nDespite these appealing features of IQE[NB ], it is unsatisfactory from the point of view\ntaken here because the presence of the lapse function means it depends on a choice of threesurface passing through S (hence the use of inverted commas in the terminology 'invariant'\nquasilocal mass above). The situation might be improved by replacing k with NB k and l with\nN\u03a3 l in Eq. (3.4), and then proceeding as before. Here NB and N\u03a3 are time and radial lapse\nfunctions, respectively (equal to N and 1/f in the AdS4 -Schwarzschild example). Admittedly\n42\n\n\fsuch a procedure is ad hoc, and unless it can be improved upon we are not particularly\ninterested in IQE[NB ]. It was introduced simply to illustrate the distinction between mass\nand energy, but for the remainder of this section we will return to the original definition of\nthe IQE.\nThe main point of this section is to draw attention to a remarkable similarity between the\nreference subtraction term given in Eq. (7.1), and a certain counterterm action recently suggested in the context of the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence. We begin by observing\nthat when the reference shear term vanishes, Eq. (7.1) reduces to precisely the same reference subtraction term suggested by Lau [37], in the context of the Brown-York quasilocal\nenergy (except that Lau's expression has a lapse function present in the manner discussed\nabove). However, our derivations of this expression are different. Lau employs a 'light cone\nreference' embedding of (S, \u03c3), together with a 'rest frame' assumption, lref = 0, to derive\nan expression for k ref , which is then used to construct his reference subtraction term. In\nour case we get the same end result, but we get it without any recourse to a reference embedding! This is because the cosmological constant term in Eq. (7.1) comes directly from\nthe explicit dependence of IQEref on the Riemann tensor of the reference spacetime, i.e., the\nterm \u03c3\u03c3Rref in Eq. (4.3). Our reference embedding of (S, \u03c3) into (M ref , g ref ) is required only\nto evaluate the reference shear term, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . This 'higher order correction'-which I\nhave argued accounts for angular momentum-is not present in Lau's reference subtraction\nterm. Also, his additional 'rest frame' assumption is not required here because the IQE is\nalready naturally a 'rest frame energy'.\nLet us now return to Eq. (1.5). We know that when space is non-compact the boundary\n(or quasilocal) energy-momentum tensor TBab = \u2212\u03a0ab /(8\u03c0) diverges in general as B is taken\nto infinity.19 To render it finite, Brown and York suggest the use of a reference subtraction\nterm that involves an isometric embedding of (B, \u03b3) into a suitable reference spacetime. However, like their prescription to embed (S, \u03c3) into a suitable three-dimensional reference space,\nthis prescription suffers from the drawback that such a codimension-one embedding does not\nalways exist. Recently, Balasubramanian and Kraus [36] have proposed an alternative procedure: Since it is always possible to add to the action a local functional of the intrinsic\ngeometry of the boundary without affecting the equations of motion or the symmetries (but\nof course this alters TBab ), their idea is to choose this functional such that its divergences\ncancel those of the original TBab , rendering the improved boundary energy-momentum tensor\nfinite as B is taken to infinity. No recourse is made to a reference embedding. This procedure\nwas first applied to spacetimes that are asymptotically AdS space, in which case the required\n'counterterms' amounted to a simple finite polynomial in the curvature invariants of B [36].\nThis idea is exactly analogous to the standard prescription for removing ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory by adding to the Lagrangian a finite polynomial in the fields.\nMoreover, the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence [47] implies that the two procedures\nare not merely analogous, they are one and the same [36].\nNow since flat spacetime is recovered from AdS space by taking l to infinity, one might\n19\n\nAs elsewhere in this paper, we use the symbol B loosely to refer to either a timelike three-surface in the\ninterior of M , bounding a finite spatial region, or the boundary at infinity. It's meaning should be clear from\nthe context in which it is used.\n\n43\n\n\fexpect that in this same limit the counterterms found by Balasubramanian and Kraus would\nproduce counterterms suitable for asymptotically flat spacetimes. It is not obvious that this\nis so [36]. However, Mann [48] has suggested the following generalization of their counterterm\naction:\ns \u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u221a\n2\n1\n(7.10)\nd3 x \u2212\u03b3 2 2 + R(\u03b3) ,\nIct =\n8\u03c0 B\u221e\nl\nwhere R(\u03b3) is the scalar curvature of (B, \u03b3), and B\u221e indicates that we are to take the limit as\nB goes to infinity. For small l Mann's formula reduces to the one given by Balasubramanian\nand Kraus, but in addition it has a smooth flat spacetime limit as l \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, Mann\nshowed that in many explicit examples it leads to a cancellation of all divergences, and the\nremaining finite part agrees with that obtained using the reference spacetime procedure [48,\n49]. While a counterterm action and a reference mass are not the same thing, the resemblance\nbetween the expressions in Eqs. (7.10) and (7.1) is nevertheless striking.20\nTo see that the connection between IQEref in Eq. (7.1) and the AdS/CFT-inspired counterterm action is probably much deeper than mere resemblance, we now turn to recent work\ndone by Kraus et al [50]. Besides providing an independent derivation of Mann's formula,\nand its generalization to higher dimensions, of most interest to us here is their geometrical\nargument suggesting what the counterterm for \u03a0ab in Eq. (1.5) should be in order to cancel\ndivergences. Their result is an expansion in powers of l. Denoting their counterterm (\u03a0\u0303ab )\nas \u03a0ct\nab , and specializing their result to a three-dimensional boundary B, they find:\n2\n3\n1\n3 1\n\u03a0ct\n\u03b3ab Rcd Rcd \u2212 R2\nab = \u2212 \u03b3ab + l Rab \u2212 \u03b3ab R + l\nl\n2\n2\n8\n\u001b\n3\n1\n1\ncd\n+ RRab \u2212 2R Racbd + Da Db R \u2212 \u2737Rab + \u03b3ab \u2737R + O(l5 ).\n4\n4\n4\n\u0012\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(7.11)\n\nThe curvatures and covariant derivatives in this expression all refer to the induced timelike\nthree-metric \u03b3ab on B.\nNow consider our usual two-surface (S, \u03c3) in the physical spacetime (M, g), which is an\nasymptotically AdS space. As we did at the end of Sec. 4, suppose that S is such that\n(k 2 \u2212 l2 ) > 0 and k\u221a> 0. Then we can always find a timelike unit vector ua normal to S such\nthat l = 0, and so k 2 \u2212 l2 = k = \u03a0ab ua ub is the Brown-York energy surface density (modulo\nthe factor of \u22121/(8\u03c0)). In other words, our unreferenced IQE reduces to the unreferenced\nBrown-York CQE, which would be called the 'unrenormalized' energy in Ref. [50]. The\na b\ncounterterm required to renormalize the energy surface density is thus \u03a0ct\nab u u , which we\nref\na b\nwill denote at Ect . Hence, our task is to compare Ect := \u03a0ct\nab u u with the integrand of IQE\nin Eq. (7.1); we expect to see at least some measure of agreement between the two.\nThis comparison will not be straightforward, however, because on the one hand we expect\nthe integrand of IQEref to depend on R, F , and their derivatives in S, as discussed previously,\nwhereas on the other hand Ect depends on the three-metric \u03b3ab . Nevertheless, let us see how\nfar we can get. Let B be a three-surface in (M, g) passing through S in a direction tangent\nto ua on S. Different choices of B satisfying these conditions will lead to different induced\n\nI am indebted to R.B. Mann for pointing out to me the significance of the \u03c3\u03c3Rref term in IQEref , and\nemphasizing that it provides at least some measure of geometrical motivation for his expression in Eq. (7.10).\n20\n\n44\n\n\fmetrics \u03b3ab , but this ambiguity will not affect our considerations. At least \u03b3ab on S is uniquely\ndetermined, and some information about \u03b3ab in the neighborhood of S is determined by the\ncondition l = 0. Our choice of B means that lab defined in Eqs. (2.8) is the extrinsic curvature\nof (S, \u03c3) as embedded in (B, \u03b3), and so the corresponding codimension-one Gauss embedding\nequation reads\nPae Pbf Pcg Pdh Ref gh = Rabcd + (lac lbd \u2212 lbc lad ).\n(7.12)\nThis is just a truncated version of Eq. (2.14), except here Ref gh is the Riemann tensor of\n(B, \u03b3), not (M, g).\n(n)\nNow let Ect denote the term in Ect of order ln . Inspection of Eq. (7.11) shows that\n(\u22121)\n(1)\nEct = 2/l. The term Ect can be written in terms of Gab , the Einstein tensor of (B, \u03b3),\nand we have\nl\nl\n(1)\n(7.13)\nEct = lGab ua ub = \u03c3 ac \u03c3 bd Rabcd = (R \u2212  \u0303l2 ).\n2\n2\nThe second equality is an easily derived identity (valid in any codimension-one setting) relating the uu component of the Einstein tensor to the sectional curvature of the hypersurface\northogonal to ua (in this case the hypersurface S in B). The third equality follows from\ncontracting Eq. (7.12) with \u03c3 ac \u03c3 bd , and using the fact that l = 0 by our choice of ua . (And\nas usual,  \u0303l2 is shorthand for  \u0303lab  \u0303lab .) Thus, to order l we have\n2 l\nEct = + (R \u2212  \u0303l2 ) + O(l3) =\nl 2\n\ns \u0014\n\n2\n2 2 + R \u2212  \u0303l2 + O(l2 ) .\nl\n\u0015\n\n(7.14)\n\nComparing the last expression with Eq. (7.1) suggests the correspondence:\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref \u2190\u2192 \u2212 \u0303l2 + O(l2).\n\n(7.15)\n\nImmediately we see something odd: we are identifying a boost invariant quantity with one\nthat is not, i.e., it seems that a k\u0303 2 is missing from the right hand side. I will comment\non this shortly. Let us assume for the moment that the right hand side reads (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 ), in\nwhich case Eq. (7.15) seems reasonable: it suggests that, if we solve the embedding equations\n(4.6-4.8) for (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref we will find that, to lowest order in l, the reference shear term is\nthe same as the unreferenced shear term, the difference to be seen at a higher order in l.\nOn the other hand, this seems like a problem: Would it not mean, e.g., that the shear\nterms in Eq. (5.5) basically cancel, thus ruining the Bondi-Sachs mass result in Eq.(5.35),\nwhich depends so crucially on (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )? The answer is No, because Eq. (5.5) is valid in\nthe asymptotically flat case, not the asymptotically AdS case. To make a statement that is\nvalid in the asymptotically flat case (l \u2192 \u221e) we need to know Ect to all orders in l, then\nsum the infinite series, and finally take the limit l \u2192 \u221e. So being at the 'other end' of the\nseries, Eq. (7.15) has nothing to say about the asymptotically flat case. But we also expected\n(k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref to depend on R, F , and their derivatives. Why do we not see these quantities\non the right hand side of Eq. (7.15)? The answer is, We will-we just have to calculate Ect\nto the next order in l.\nBut before doing so I will comment on the 'missing' k\u0303 2 in Eq. (7.15). Kraus et al [50] have\ndevised an algorithm to compute the extrinsic geometrical quantity \u03a0ct\nab from the intrinsic\n45\n\n\fgeometry of B. Insofar as lab (and thus  \u0303l2 ) depends only on the metric \u03b3ab , there is no doubt\nthat the \u2212 \u0303l2 term in Eq. (7.15) is 'correct'. On the other hand, kab (and thus k\u0303 2 ) depends\non the extrinsic geometry of B, being just a certain projection of \u03a0ab into S. The algorithm\nof Kraus et al relies on the fact [51] that the divergent part of the derivative of \u03a0ab in the\ndirection normal to B can be expressed in terms of just the intrinsic geometry of B. In\nessence, their algorithm is designed precisely to compute the divergent part of \u03a0ab . The\n'correctness' of the accompanying finite part is a subtle issue. In a slightly different context,\nthey discuss two different counterterm actions that both properly cancel divergences, but\nthat lead to different finite terms in the action. Furthermore, they point out that their\nalgorithm, when carried to all orders in l, might imply singularities in the bulk spacetime,\nbut that this is of no concern because they truncate their counterterm expressions to a\nfinite number of terms, enough at least to cancel the divergences. In our case we have the\nquasilocal idea in mind, and so are interested in all of the finite terms-it matters what\nhappens in the bulk. But going further with this discussion will take us beyond the scope\nset for this simple comparison. I will just conclude by saying that, insofar as the shear terms\nalmost certainly represent a finite contribution to the energy, we do not necessarily expect\nthe algorithm of Kraus et al to produce a k\u0303 2 term on the right hand side of Eq. (7.15). Our\ngoals are slightly different, and it is too much to expect exact agreement between Ect and\nthe integrand of IQEref .\nNevertheless, it is still instructive to proceed with the comparison to the next order in\nl. In light of my previous remarks, we will make the simplifying assumption that the metric\non B has a product structure: \u03b3ab dxa dxb = \u2212N 2 dt2 + \u03c3ij (x) dxi dxj , where xa = (t, xi ) are\nlocal coordinates on B, N is a constant lapse, and \u03c3ij (x) is the metric on any t = constant\ntwo-surface S. The idea is that Ect and the integrand of IQEref should agree at least in their\ndependence on the intrinsic geometry of (S, \u03c3). Assuming such a product structure for \u03b3ab\nis a convenient was to isolate this dependence, and ignore everything else.\nIn this case the only nonvanishing components of the Riemann tensor of \u03b3ab are Rijkl =\n(1)\nRijkl , the Riemann tensor of \u03c3ij . And clearly lab = 0. Thus Ect in Eq. (7.13) reduces to\n(3)\nlR/2, and it is a simple exercise to work out Ect . The net result is\n3\n\n2 l\nl\nEct = + R \u2212\nR2 \u2212 4 \u25b3R + O(l5) =\nl 2\n16\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nv \"\nu\nu\nt2\n\n#\n\n2\nl2\n+\nR\n\u2212\n\u25b3R + O(l4) ,\nl2\n2\n\n(7.16)\n\nwhere \u25b3 is the Laplacian in (S, \u03c3). Comparing the last expression with Eq. (7.1) we now\nhave the higher order correspondence:\n2\n\nl\n(k\u0303 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref \u2190\u2192 \u2212 \u25b3R + O(l4 ).\n2\n2\n\n(7.17)\n\nThus we begin to see how a solution to our embedding equations might yield an expression\nfor (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref in terms of R, F , and their derivatives, as we have expected all along.\nTo conclude this section we make two general observations. First, it is especially clear\nfrom the higher order expression in Eq. (7.16) that the AdS/CFT-inspired counterterm\nenergy is, in fact, the square root of some quantity. This is not surprising, since the algorithm\n46\n\n\fof Kraus et al [50] is a means of solving a Gauss embedding equation for \u03a0ct\nab , and this\nct\nequation is quadratic in \u03a0ab . But it is significant. Beginning simply with the definition of\nthe quasilocal energy-momentum tensor as the functional derivative of the action with respect\nto the boundary metric [7], in which there is no square root in sight, the counterterm energy\nrequired to cancel divergences unmistakably involves a square root. Moreover, it concurs\nwith the square root introduced here, in the context\nthe IQE, as the general relativistic\n\u221a of\n2\nanalogue of the special relativistic formula: m = E \u2212 p~ 2 . I believe it is unlikely this is\na mere coincidence. Given that it is nonanalytic, a square root is too unusual an object to\noccur without good reason.\nSecondly, under the square root (in our case) is 2/l2 + R + (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . In the case of\nthe AdS/CFT-inspired counterterm energy [50], it is 2/l2 + R + X, where X is an infinite\nseries in increasing powers of l. That X is clearly not zero lends strong support for our\nadditional term (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref , which is thus seen to be a necessary generalization of Lau's\nsuggestion [37]. I have argued that its necessity is closely linked to the proper inclusion\nof angular momentum in the energy. Given that angular momentum is a subtle notion in\ngeneral relativity, especially so at the quasilocal level we envision here, it is not surprising\nthat our biggest difficulty lies in evaluating (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . In light of the algorithm given by\nKraus et al [50], work is currently in progress to try to apply similar techniques to solve\nthe embedding equations (4.6-4.8). Since these embedding equations are manifestly boost\ninvariant, I expect at least to recover the 'missing' k\u0303 2 term in Eq. (7.15), and hopefully the\nentire series.\n\n8\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nIn this paper I have introduced a new definition of quasilocal energy that is a simple\nmodification\nof the Brown-York quasilocal energy. I just replace their energy surface density\n\u221a\nk with k 2 \u2212 l2 , where l is the radial momentum surface density. (For ease of exposition\nhere I will omit the \u22121/(8\u03c0) factors.)\u221a The principle motivation for doing this stems from\nan analogy with the formula: m = E 2 \u2212 p~ 2 in special relativity. Identifying\n\u221a E with k\n2\n2\n(which\n\u221a are both energies), and p~ with l (both momenta), identifies\u221am with k \u2212 l . Like\nm, k 2 \u2212 l2 is a boost invariant quantity, and hence the integral of k 2 \u2212 l2 over a spacelike\ntwo-surface S gives rise to an 'invariant quasilocal energy', or IQE. In what follows I will\nrefer to the Brown-York quasilocal energy as the CQE-canonical\u221aquasilocal energy.\nThere are several important consequences of replacing k with k 2 \u2212 l2 :\n\u221a\n\u2022 While k is always well defined for any spacelike two-surface S, k 2 \u2212 l2 is not. Roughly\nspeaking, it is real when S lies in the exterior region of a black hole, zero when it is on\nthe horizon, and imaginary in the black hole interior. Thus (again roughly speaking)\nthe IQE asserts that energy is real only outside of a black hole.\n\u2022 Both the CQE and the IQE require a reference energy subtraction procedure. Since k\nis associated with a spacelike three-surface spanning S, the reference space into which\nS is to be isometrically embedded is inherently three-dimensional. Such a codimensionone embedding does not always exist, but when it does, it is essentially unique. This\n47\n\n\f\u221a\nmeans the CQE, when it is defined, is unique. In contrast, k 2 \u2212 l2 makes no reference to a three-surface spanning S, and so the reference space(time) is inherently\nfour-dimensional. Such codimension-two embeddings (at least of a generic non-round\nsphere into Minkowski space) always exist [35], but are not unique. However, in this\nsituation there are two curvatures associated with S: the scalar curvature R, and the\ncurvature of the normal bundle, F . A necessary condition for an isometric embedding\nis that Rref = R. I argued that demanding also F ref = F is both a means to make\nthe embedding essentially unique, and at the same time, a geometrically natural way\nto properly incorporate angular momentum into energy at the quasilocal level. Indeed, since angular momentum is associated with rotational kinetic energy, it should\ncontribute to the energy in some way.\n\u2022 While CQEref is associated with a reference energy density k ref , IQEref is concerned\nwith a reference shear term, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . (k\u0303ab and  \u0303lab are the trace-free parts of the\ntwo extrinsic curvatures of S.) In a certain sense, the IQE already inherently contains\nthe correct reference energy, without recourse to a reference embedding. The reference\nembedding is required only to determine the reference shear term, which is a higher\norder correction to the energy associated with angular momentum.\n\u221a\n\u2022 The CQE is sensitive to the sign of k, whereas since it involves k 2 \u2212 l2 , the IQE\nis not. Thus one can easily construct simple examples for which the two energies\ngive different results, even when l = 0. Thus the IQE is not simply the 'rest energy'\nversion of the CQE. Note: the IQE naturally assigns zero energy to any two-surface\nin flat spacetime. This is because the natural reference spacetime in this case is the\nvery same spacetime, namely flat spacetime. So obviously one can always referenceembed the two-surface identically (up to Poincar\u00e9 transformations) to the way it is\nembedded in the physical spacetime, and get IQE = 0. The only subtlety that may\narise is if the two conditions: 'isometric embedding' and 'F ref = F ' do not uniquely\ndetermine (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . Then the flat spacetime result (IQE = 0) may be reduced\nto a choice, rather than a necessary fact. To properly address this subtlety requires\nan in depth understanding of the embedding equations. But in any case, the fact\nthat IQE = 0 in flat spacetime is independent of the motion of the observers. In\ncontrast, moving observers in flat spacetime could measure nonzero energy in the\nBrown-York approach [31]. This is because under a radial boost the Brown-York\nenergy surface density dilates by a Lorentz factor, as in special relativity, whereas the\nreference energy surface density does not. According to Ref. [7] the latter depends only\non the intrinsic geometry of S, and therefore does not know about the time derivative\nof this geometry.21\nWe examined both the large and small sphere limits of the IQE, taking S to be asymptotically round for simplicity. In an asymptotically flat spacetime, the large sphere limit of the\nIQE in a spatial direction yields the ADM mass. In the future null direction it reduces to the\nBondi-Sachs mass, provided the reference shear term is a total divergence. Short of solving\n21\n\nI thank R.B. Mann and I.S. Booth for this remark on the Brown-York case.\n\n48\n\n\fthe embedding equations, I gave a heuristic argument which shows that is is. It is significant\nthat this argument relies on the condition F ref = F , since this provides evidence that the\ncurvature of the normal bundle is involved in quasilocal energy, albeit its involvement in this\nsimple example is\u221aminimal.\nThe quantity k 2 \u2212 l2 is proportional to the mean curvature of S as a two-surface embedded in the physical spacetime, and so the IQE is a natural geometrical invariant of S.\nSince the Hawking mass [25] is constructed using (k 2 \u2212 l2 ), the IQE can be thought of\nroughly as the square root of the Hawking mass. In the small sphere limit the square root\ndisappears, and to leading order the IQE reduces to the Hawking mass (but differs from it\nat higher order). Thus, when matter is present, the lowest order contribution to the IQE\nmat a b\ngives the standard result: (4\u03c0r 3/3) Tab\nu u , i.e., the expected matter energy contained in\na small sphere of proper radius r. Note that ua here is not necessarily the four-velocity of\nany observer on S, since the IQE is boost invariant, and so independent of the observers'\nvelocities on S. Rather, ua is the four-velocity that observers would have if they were in the\nrest frame determined by S. More precisely, in the small sphere limit we considered, namely\na t, r = constant two-sphere in Riemann normal coordinates (with t \u221d r), ua = (\u2202/\u2202t)a\nevaluated at the center of the sphere. In the limit r \u2192 0, the four-velocity (\u2202/\u2202t)a corresponds to observers who at each point on S have zero radial momentum, i.e., l = 0. In\ngeneral, since the IQE is an energy rather than a mass, the question arises, In whose rest\nframe is the energy measured?22 The answer is, The 'quasilocal rest frame' determined by\nthe condition l = 0 at each point on S. Whenever (k 2 \u2212 l2 ) > 0, observers on S can always\nachieve this state of motion by appropriate local radial boosts. This (or more precisely,\n(k 2 \u2212 l2 ) \u2265 0) is the same condition required for the unreferenced IQE to be well defined in\nthe first place-refer to the text in the first bullet on page 47.\nReturning to the small sphere case, in vacuo the leading order contribution due to gravitational energy occurs at order r 5 . At this order the IQE results are inconclusive because it\nis expected that the reference shear term will play a significant role, and without a solution\nto the embedding equations (which is an extremely difficult problem) this term cannot be\ndetermined. Nevertheless, it was possible to show that in the small sphere limit, the Hawking\nmass, which in this case is closely related to the IQE, can be understood as a measure of\nthe gravitational energy contained in S by considering certain tangential 'electromagnetic'\n~ and B\n~ induced on S by the Weyl curvature S is embedded in. In terms of E\n~ and B,\n~\nfields E\ngravitational energy and radiation are essentially identical in nature to their counterparts\n~ *E\n~ +B\n~ * B)/(8\u03c0)\n~\nin electromagnetism, except for one crucial difference: the density r(E\nis\nintegrated over the surface S to determine the gravitational energy contained in the spatial\nvolume that S encloses. Here r can be thought of as the areal radius of S, so the measurement\nis truly quasilocal.\nThe IQE was analyzed in the context of asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The\nfact that IQEref depends explicitly on the Riemann tensor of the reference spacetime (naturally taken to be anti-de Sitter space) was seen to play a significant role. A connection\nwas established between IQEref and a certain counterterm energy that has recently been\nproposed [50] in the context of the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence. Two similarities\n22\n\nI thank A. Ashtekar for posing this question.\n\n49\n\n\fare striking: (i) Both energies involve a square root, and (ii) the two leading terms under the\nsquare root match. The remaining term under the square root in our case is the reference\nshear term, (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref ; in the case of Ref. [50] it is an infinite series in increasing powers\nof l, where l is the radius of curvature of the AdS space. It was shown that the first two\nnontrivial terms of this series (i.e., to the highest order given in Ref. [50]) can plausibly be\nidentified with (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . This agreement is impressive because IQEref and the AdS/CFTinspired counterterm energy are independently motivated, and derived quite differently. It\nmight be possible to use techniques developed in Ref. [50] to solve our embedding equations\nfor (k\u0303 2 \u2212  \u0303l2 )ref . The present lack of a solution to these equations is the main outstanding\nobstacle to further understanding the nature of the IQE.\nA final remark is in order. Most definitions of quasilocal energy, including the IQE,\nassume that energy is associated with a closed spacelike two-surface, S. Given such a twosurface one can always find a timelike unit normal vector field ua , which at each point on\nS is supposed to correspond to an observer's instantaneous four-velocity. But this may not\nbe a general enough setting. While a two-parameter family of observers will always sweep\nout a timelike three-surface B, the two-surface elements orthogonal to their world lines in\nB are not, in general, integrable. Thus a shift in emphasis from S to B, i.e., from Eulerian\nto Lorentzian observers [28], might lead to a deeper understanding of quasilocal energy,\nin particular of gravitational radiation at the quasilocal level. This shift would also bring\nthe quasilocal energy idea closer in line with the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence.\nWhether or not this is the right direction, the results in Sec. 7 strongly suggest that this is\nthe direction the IQE is pointing in.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Joseph Samuel, Madhavan Varadarajan, and Sukanya Sinha at the\nRaman Research Institute for their continued encouragement.
