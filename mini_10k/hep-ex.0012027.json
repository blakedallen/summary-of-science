The precise measurement of the momentum spectrum allows a\ndetermination of the fraction of two-body and multi-body decay modes, and helps in understanding\n(\u2217)\u00b1\nb \u2192 cc\u0304s transitions. In this study we report a new measurement of the inclusive Ds\nproduction\nrate in B decays and the branching fractions of two specific two-body B decay modes involving a\n(\u2217)\u00b1\nDs\nmeson. We have also studied the decay modes B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ and measured\nthe corresponding branching fractions using fully-reconstructed events. Those measurements are\ninteresting for testing factorization models of B decays to open charm.\n\n2\n\nDataset\n\nThe data were collected with the BABAR detector operating at the PEP-II storage ring at\n(\u2217)\nthe Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. For the inclusive Ds production in B decays and the\n(\u2217)+\nB 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 Ds\nbranching fraction measurements we used a data sample equivalent to 7.7 fb\u22121\nof integrated luminosity collected while running on the \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB resonance and a sample of\n1.2 fb\u22121 collected 40 MeV/c2 below the B B\u0304 threshold. Branching fraction measurements for the\nB 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ modes use a subset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n5.2 fb\u22121 .\n\n3\n\nInclusive Ds(\u2217) Production in B Decay\n\nThe Ds\u00b1 mesons are reconstructed in the Ds\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 decay mode with \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 . Particle\nidentification is used to obtain a clean sample. Three charged tracks coming from a common vertex\nare combined to form a Ds\u00b1 . Two of them, with opposite charge, are required to be positively\nidentified as kaons and their invariant mass must be within 8 MeV of the nominal \u03c6 mass. In\nthis decay the \u03c6 meson is polarized longitudinally which means the helicity angle of the decay,\n\u03b8H has a cos2 \u03b8H dependence[1]. The requirement | cos \u03b8H | > 0.3 keeps 97.5% of the signal while\nrejecting 30% of the background. Candidate Ds\u2217\u00b1 mesons are reconstructed in the decay channel\nDs\u2217\u00b1 \u2192 Ds\u00b1 \u03b3 with Ds\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 . Ds\u00b1 candidates are required to be within 2.5\u03c3 of the \u03c6\u03c0 invariant\nmass. Photon candidates must deposit a minimum energy of 50 MeV/c2 in the calorimeter. The\nnumber of Ds\u00b1 mesons is extracted from a Gaussian fit of the \u03c6\u03c0 \u00b1 invariant mass distribution\nfor different momentum ranges in the \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB rest frame. Similarly, the number of Ds\u2217\u00b1 is\nextracted by fitting the mass difference mDs\u2217 \u2212 mDs distribution. The efficiency-corrected number\n(\u2217)\u00b1\n\n(\u2217)\u00b1\n\nof reconstructed Ds\nas a function of momentum is shown in Fig. 1. To determine the Ds\nmomentum spectrum for the continuum, the on-resonance spectrum with momentum higher than\n2.45 GeV/c and luminosity-scaled off-resonance spectrum are corrected for efficiency and then fit\n(\u2217)\u00b1\nwith the Peterson fragmentation function. The momentum spectrum of Ds\nproduced in B decays\nis obtained by subtracting the fitted Peterson function from the efficiency-corrected on-resonance\nspectrum.

The Ds\nare fully reconstructed, we do not reconstruct\n(\u2217)+\n0\n\u2217\u2212\nthe D coming from the D decay. Instead, we combine a Ds\ncandidate with a \u03c0 \u2212 and then\n(\u2217)+\ncalculate missing mass assuming that the Ds\nand \u03c0 \u2212 originate from the same B 0 . This missing\n(\u2217)+\n0\nmass should be the D mass if our hypothesis is correct. The yield of B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 Ds\nis evaluated\nby fitting the missing mass distribution (Fig. 2) with the sum of a Gaussian and a background\nfunction[1]. The branching fractions we measure are (7.1 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b1 2.5 \u00b1 1.8) \u00d7 10\u22123 for the channel\nB 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 Ds+ , and (2.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22122 for the channel for B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 Ds\u2217+ .\n\n\fMeasurement of B 0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212\u03c0+ and B 0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212\u03c1+ Branching Fractions\n\n5\n\nB 0 candidates in the channels D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + and D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ are fully reconstructed in the decay chain\n\u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , followed by D0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . The \u03c1+ is reconstructed in the mode \u03c1+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 .\nEvent selection is based on a few simple criteria. Tracks are required to originate from near\nthe beam interaction point and no particle identification is used. Photons with energy grater\nthan 30 MeV/c2 are combined to form \u03c0 0 candidates. To form a D 0 candidate, kaons and pions\nwith opposite charge and originating from the same vertex must have an invariant mass within\n\u00b12.5\u03c3 of the nominal D 0 mass. The D 0 candidates are required to have a momentum grater\nthan 1.3 GeV/c in the \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB frame and are combined with a pion to form a charged\nD \u2217 candidate. D \u2217 candidates are required to have \u2206m = m(D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u2212 m(D0 ) within 2.5\u03c3 of\nthe nominal mass difference. Finally, we combine D \u2217 candidates with a \u03c0 + , with a momentum\ngrater than 500 MeV/c or a \u03c1+ candidate to form B 0 candidates. In the decay B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 +\nthe longitudinal polarization of the D \u2217\u2212 is used to reduce background[2]. For the B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+\nmode, \u03c1+ candidates are selected requiring the \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 invariant mass within 150 MeV of the \u03c1+\nnominal mass. Event shape variables are also used to remove continuum background. For correctly\n\u2217 evaluated in the \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 BB frame\nreconstructed B mesons,\nthe energy of the B candidate,\nEB\n0\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2217 \u2212 s/2. The beam energy substituted mass, m\nmust be equal to s/2. We define \u2206E = EB\n0\nES\n\u221a\nP\n2\nis defined as m2ES = ( s/2) \u2212 ( i pi )2 , where pi is the momentum of the ith daughter of the B\ncandidate. The variables \u2206E and mES are used to define the signal and sideband regions. For both\nmodes, the region between 5.2 and 5.3 GeV/c2 in mES and between \u00b1300 MeV/c2 in \u2206E is used\nto study signal and background properties. We discriminate against correlated background from B\ndecays where a real final state pion (e.g. from higher-multiplicity B 0 decays) is either not included\nin the reconstruction, or a random one is added to the observed state, with a requirement on\n|\u2206E|. The measurement of branching fractions requires an estimate of the number of signal events.\nA Gaussian and a background \u221a\nfunction[3], which parametrizes how the phase space approaches\nzero as the energy approaches s/2, are used to fit the mES distribution obtained by requiring\n|\u2206E| < 2.5\u03c3\u2206E as shown in Fig. 2.\nBased on the fitted yield of signal events the preliminary results for the branching fractions\nfor B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ are (2.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 and (11.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 2.5) \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nrespectively. The branching fraction for B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ includes all non-resonant and quasi-twobody contributions that lead to a \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 invariant mass in the \u03c1 band; however, the acceptance for\nnon-resonant D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays is about 15% of D \u2217+ \u03c1+ . Moreover, previous measurements indicate\nthat the non-resonant branching fraction is comparatively small. Therefore we estimate that the\nnon-resonant contribution to our result is small. Both branching fraction results compare well with\nprevious measurements and with the world average[4].\nD \u2217\u2212\n\nReferences\n\nReferences\n(\u2217)\u00b1\n\n[1] BABAR collaboration, \"Study of inclusive Ds\nproduction in B decays and measurement\n(\u2217)+\n0\n\u2217\u2212\nof B \u2192 D Ds\ndecays using a partial reconstruction technique\", BABAR-CONF-00/13,\nSLAC-PUB-8535, submitted to the XXXth International Conference on High Energy Physics,\nOsaka, Japan, July 2000\n\n\f[2] BABAR collaboration, \"Measurement of the branching fractions of B 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c0 + and\nB 0 \u2192 D \u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ \" BABAR-CONF-00/06, SLAC-PUB-8528 , submitted to the XXXth International Conference on High Energy Physics, Osaka, Japan, July 2000\n[3] ARGUS Collaboration, H.
