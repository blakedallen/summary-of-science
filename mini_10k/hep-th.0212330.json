INTRODUCTION\n\nIn a common sense, it is generally settled that a \"good\" Quantum Field Theory (QFT) must respect at least\ntwo symmetries: the Lorentz covariance and the CPT invariance. The traditional framework of a local QFT, from\nwhich one derives the Standard Model that sets the physics inherent to the fundamental particles, satisfies both\nthese symmetries. In the beginning of 90 \u0301s, a new work [1] proposing a correction term to the conventional Maxwell\nElectrodynamics, that preserves the gauge invariance despite breaking the Lorentz, CPT and parity symmetries, was\nfirst analyzed. The correction term, composed by the gauge potential, A\u03bc , and an external background 4-vector, v\u03bc ,\nhas a Chern-Simons-like structure, \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb v\u03bc A\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb , and is responsible by inducing an optical activity of the vacuum - or\nbirefringence - among other effects. In this same work, however, it is shown that astrophysical data do not support the\nbirefringence and impose stringent limits on the value of the constant vector v\u03bc , reducing it to a negligible correction\nterm. Similar conclusions, also based on astrophysical observations, were also confirmed by Goldhaber & Timble [3].\nSome time later, Colladay and Kostelecky [2] adopted a quantum field theoretical framework to address the issue of\nCPT- and Lorentz-breakdown as a spontaneous violation. In this sense, they constructed an extension to the minimal\nStandard Model, which maintains unaffected the SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge structure of the usual theory, and\nincorporates the CPT-violation as an active feature of the effective low-energy broken action. They started from a\nusual CPT- and Lorentz-invariant action as defining the properties of what would be an underlying theory at the\nPlanck scale [4], which then suffers a spontaneous breaking of both these symmetries. In the broken phase, there rises\nthe effective action, endowed with breakdown of CPT and Lorentz symmetries, but conservation of covariance under\nthe perspective of the observer inertial frame. The Lorentz invariance is spoiled at the level of the particle-system,\nwhich can be viewed in terms of the non-invariance of the fields under boost and Lorentz rotations (relative inertial\nobserver-frames). This covariance breakdown is also manifest when analyzing the dispersion relations, extracted from\nthe propagators.\nInvestigations concerning the unitarity, causality and consistency of a QFT endowed with violation of Lorentz and\nCPT symmetries (induced by a Chern-Simons term) were carried out by Adam & Klinkhamer [5]. As result, it was\nverified that the causality and unitarity of this kind of model can be preserved when the fixed (background) 4-vector\n\n\u2217\n\ne-mails: belich@cbpf.br, manojr@cbpf.br, helayel@cbpf.br, orlando@cce.ufes.br\n\n1\n\n\fis space-like, and spoiled whenever it is time-like or null. A consistency analysis of this model, carried out in the\nadditional presence of a scalar sector endowed with spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) [7], has confirmed the\nresults obtained in ref. [5], that is: the space-like case is free from unitarity illnesses, which arise in the time- and\nlight-like cases.\nThe active development of Lorentz- and CPT-violating theories in D = 1 + 3 has come across the inquiry about\nthe structure of a similar model in 1+2 dimensions and its possible implications. In order to study a planar theory,\nendowed with Lorentz- and CPT-violation, one has decided to adopt a dimensional reduction procedure, that is: one\nstarts from the original Chern-Simons-like term, \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb v\u03bc A\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb , promoting its systematic reduction to D = 1 + 2,\nwhich yields a pure Chern-Simons term and a Lorentz non-invariant mixing term. Our objective, therefore, is to\nachieve a planar model, whose structure is derived from a known counterpart defined in 1+3 dimensions, and to\ninvestigate some of its features, like propagators, dispersion relations, causality, stability and unitarity.\nMore specifically, one performs the dimensional reduction to 1+2 dimensions of the Abelian gauge invariant model\nwith non-conservation of the Lorentz and CPT symmetries [1], [5] induced by the term \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb v\u03bc A\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb , resulting\nin a gauge invariant Planar Quantum Electrodynamics (QED3 ) composed by a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field\n(A\u03bc ) , by a scalar field (\u03c6) , a scalar parameter (s) without dynamics (the Chern-Simons mass), and a fixed 3-vector\n(v \u03bc ). Besides the MCS sector, this Lagrangian has a massless scalar sector, represented by the field \u03c6, which also\nworks out as the coupling constant in the Chern-Simons-like structure that mixes the gauge field to the 3-vector,\nv \u03bc (where one gauge field is replaced by v \u03bc ). This latter term is the responsible by the Lorentz noninvariance.\nTherefore, the reduced Lagrangian is endowed with three coupled sectors: a MCS sector, a massless Klein-Gordon\nsector and a mixing Lorentz-violating one. As it is well-known, the MCS sector breaks both parity and time-reversal\nsymmetries, but preserves the Lorentz and CPT ones. The scalar sector preserves all discrete symmetries and Lorentz\ncovariance, whereas the mixing sector, as it will be seen, breaks Lorentz invariance (in relation to the particle-frame),\nkeeps conserved parity and charge-conjugation symmetries, but may break or preserve time-reversal symmetry. This\nimplies that it may occur both conservation (for a purely space-like v \u03bc ) and violation (for v \u03bc time-like and light-like)\nof the CPT invariance.\nIn short, this paper is outlined as follows. In Section II, one accomplishes the dimensional reduction, that leads\nto the reduced model. Having established the new planar Lagrangian, one then devotes some algebraic effort for the\nderivation of the propagators of the gauge and scalar fields, which requires the evaluation of a closed algebra composed\nby eleven projector operators, displayed into Table I. In Section III, we investigate the stability and the causal structure\nof the theory. One addresses the causality looking directly at the dispersion relations extracted from the poles of the\npropagators, which reveal the existence of both causal and non-causal modes. All the modes, nevertheless, present\npositive definite energy (positivity) relative to any Lorentz frame, which implies an overall stability. In Section IV,\nwe accomplish the unitarity analysis, based on the matrix residue evaluated at the poles of the propagators. The\nunitarity of the overall model is ensured in the case one adopts a purely space-like background-vector, v \u03bc . In Section\nV, we present our Concluding Comments.\nII. THE DIMENSIONALLY REDUCED MODEL\n\nOne starts from the Maxwell Lagrangian1 in 1+3 dimensions supplemented by a term that couples the dual electromagnetic tensor to a fixed 4-vector, v \u03bc , as it appears in ref. [1]:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\nL1+3 = \u2212 F\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 F \u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 + \u01eb\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 \u03ba\u0302\u03bb\u0302 v\u03bc\u0302 A\u03bd\u0302 F\u03ba\u0302\u03bb\u0302 + A\u03bd\u0302 J \u03bd\u0302 ,\n(1)\n4\n2\nwith the additional presence of the coupling between the gauge field and the external current, A\u03bd\u0302 J \u03bd\u0302 . This model (in its\nfree version) is gauge invariant but does not preserve Lorentz and CPT symmetries relative to the particle frame. For\nthe observer system, the Chern-Simons-like term transforms covariantly, once the background also is changed under\n\u2032\nan observer boost: v \u03bc\u0302 \u2212\u2192 v \u03bc\u0302 = \u039b\u03bc \u03b1 v \u03b1 . In connection with the particle-system, however, when one applies a boost\non the particle, the background 4-vector is supposed to remain unaffected, behaving like a set of four independent\nnumbers, which configures the breaking of the covariance. This term also breaks the parity symmetry, but maintain\ninvariance under charge conjugation and time reversal. To study this model in 1+2 dimensions, one performs its\n\n1\n\nHere one has adopted the following metric conventions: g\u03bc\u03bd = (+, \u2212, \u2212, \u2212) in D = 1 + 3, and g\u03bc\u03bd = (+, \u2212, \u2212) in D = 1 + 2.\nThe greek letters (with hat) \u03bc\u0302, run from 0 to 3, while the pure greek letters, \u03bc, run from 0 to 2.\n\n2\n\n\fdimensional reduction, which consists effectively in adopting the following ansatz over any 4-vector: (i) one keeps\nunaffected the temporal and also the first two spatial components; (ii) one freezes the third spacial dimension by\nsplitting it from the body of the new 3-vector and requiring that the new quantities (\u03c7), defined in 1+2 dimensions,\ndo not depend on the third spacial dimension: \u22023 \u03c7 \u2212\u2192 0. Applying this prescription to the gauge 4-vector, A\u03bc\u0302 , and\nto the fixed external 4-vector, v \u03bc\u0302 , and to the 4-current, J \u03bc\u0302 , one has:\nA\u03bc\u0302 \u2212\u2192 (A\u03bc ; \u03c6),\nv \u03bc\u0302 \u2212\u2192 (v \u03bc ; s),\nJ \u03bc\u0302 \u2212\u2192 (J \u03bc ; J),\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere: A(3) = \u03c6, v (3) = s, J (3) = J and \u03bc = 0, 1, 2. According to this process, there appear two scalars: the scalar\nfield, \u03c6, that exhibits dynamics, and s, a constant scalar (without dynamics). Carrying out this prescription for eq.\n(1), one then obtains:\n1\ns\n1\n1\n2\n(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + A\u03bc J \u03bc + \u03c6J,\nL1+2 = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bdk A\u03bc \u2202 \u03bd Ak + \u03c6\u01eb\u03bc\u03bdk v \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd Ak \u2212\n4\n2\n2\n2\u03b1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the last free term represents the gauge-fixing term, added up after the dimensional reduction. The scalar field,\n\u03c6, exhibits a typical Klein-Gordon massless dynamics and it also appears as the coupling constant that links the fixed\nv \u03bc to the gauge sector of the model, by means of the new term: \u03c6\u01eb\u03bc\u03bdk v \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd Ak . In spite of being covariant in form,\nthis kind of term breaks the Lorentz symmetry in the particle-frame, since the 3-vector v \u03bc is not sensitive to particle\nLorentz boost, behaving like a set of three scalars.\nThe Lagrangian (1), originally proposed by Carroll-Field-Jackiw [1], has the property of breaking parity symmetry,\neven though conserving time reversal and charge conjugation symmetries, resulting in nonconservation of the CPT\nsymmetry. Simultaneously, the Lorentz invariance is spoiled, since the fixed 4-vector v \u03bc breaks the rotational and\nboost invariances. On the other hand, the reduced model, given by eq.(5), does not necessarily jeopardize the CPT\nconservation, which depends truly on the character of the fixed vector v \u03bc . As it is known, the parity transformation\n\u2032\nP\n(P) in 1+2 dimensions is characterized by the inversion of only on of the spatial axis: x\u03bc \u2212\u2192 x \u03bc = (xo , \u2212x, y),\n\u2032\nP\nthe same being valid for the 3-potential: A\u03bc \u2212\u2192 A \u03bc = (A0 , \u2212A(1) , A(2) ). The time-reversal transformation (T )\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nmust keep unchanged the dynamics of the system, so that one must have: x\u03bc \u2212\u2192 x \u03bc = (\u2212xo , x, y), A\u03bc \u2212\u2192 A \u03bc =\n\u2032\n\u2032\nC\nC\n(A0 , \u2212A(1) , \u2212A(2) ), while the charge conjugation determines: x\u03bc \u2212\u2192 x \u03bc = x\u03bc , A\u03bc \u2212\u2192 A \u03bc = \u2212A\u03bc . One knows that\nthe Chern-Simons term breaks both parity and time-reversal symmetries and keeps conserved the charge conjugation,\nwhich assures the global CPT invariance. The new term, \u03c6\u03b5\u03bc\u03bdk v \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd Ak , however, will manifest a non-symmetric\nbehaviour before T -transformation: there will occur conservation if one works with a purely space-like external vector\n\u2212\n(v \u03bc = (0, \u2192\nv ) ), or breakdown, if v \u03bc is purely time-like. Under parity and charge conjugation transformations, in turn,\nthis term will evidence non-invariance for any adopted v \u03bc , thereby one can state that it will occur CPT conservation\nwhen v \u03bc is purely space-like, and CPT violation otherwise. Here, the field \u03c6 was considered as having a scalar\ncharacter under the parity transformation. Yet, if this field behaves like a pseudo-scalar2, the CPT conversation will\nbe assured for a purely time-like v \u03bc . For a light-like v \u03bc , there will always occur time-reversal non-invariance, and\nconsequently, CPT violation.\nNeglecting divergence terms, one can write the linearized free action in an explicitly quadratic form, namely:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n3 1\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03b1\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd \u03b1\n\u03a31+2 = d x A [M\u03bc\u03bd ]A \u2212 \u03c6\u0003\u03c6 + \u03c6 [\u01eb\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd v \u2202 ] A + A [\u01eb\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc v \u2202 ] \u03c6 ,\n(6)\n2\nwhich can also appear in the matrix form:\nZ\n1\n\u03a31+2 = d3 x\n2\n\nA\u03bc \u03c6\n\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0012 \u03bd \u0013\n\u0001 M\u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\nA\n.\n\u03c6\n\u2212T\u03bd \u2212\u0003\n\n(7)\n\nThe action (7) has as nucleus a square matrix, P, composed by the quadratic operators of the initial action. The mass\ndimension of the physical parameters and tensors are: [A\u03bc ] = [\u03c6] = 1/2, [v \u03bc ] = [s] = 1, [T\u03bc ] = [M\u03bc\u03bd ] = 2. Here, some\ndefinitions are necessary:\n\n\u2212\n\u2192 P\n\u2212\n\u2192\nThe adoption of a pseudo-scalar field can be justified by looking at the vector character of the potential ( A \u2212\u2192 \u2212 A ) before\nthe dimensional reduction. If one assumes that the field \u03c6 maintains the same behaviour of its ancestral (A3 ), one has a\npseudo-scalar.\n2\n\n3\n\n\fM\u03bc\u03bd = \u0003\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd + s S\u03bc\u03bd +\n\n\u0003\n\u03c9\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03b1\n\nS\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b5\u03bc\u03ba\u03bd \u2202 \u03ba , \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nT\u03bd = S\u03bc\u03bd v \u03bc ,\n\u03c9\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\n,\n\u0003\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c9\u03bc\u03bd , S\u03bc\u03bd stand respectively for the transverse, longitudinal and Chern-Simons dimensionless projectors,\nwhile M\u03bc\u03bd is the quadratic operator associated to the MCS sector.

By the above expressions, one notes that the factor \u22a0 is present on\nthe denominator of all propagators, in such a way the scalar and the gauge field will share the pole structure, and\nconsequently, the physical excitations associated with the poles of \u22a0(k). This common dependence on 1/\u22a0 also\namounts to similarities on the causal structure of the scalar and gauge sectors of this model, as it will de discussed in\nSection III.\nIII. DISPERSION RELATIONS, STABILITY AND CAUSALITY ANALYSIS\n\nSome references in literature [5], [6], [8] have dealt with the issue of stability, causality and unitarity concerning\nto Lorentz- and CPT-violating theories. The causality is usually addressed as a quantum feature that requires the\ncommutation between observables separated by a space-like interval, which one calls microcausality in field theory\n[9]. In this section, however, one analyzes causality under a classical tree-level perspective, in which it is related to\nthe positivity of a usual Lorentz invariant, k 2 . The starting-point of all investigation is the propagator, whose poles\nare associated to dispersion relations (DR) that provide informations about the stability and causality of the model.\nThe causality analysis is then related to the sign of the propagator poles, given in terms of k 2 , in such a way one must\nhave k 2 \u2265 0 in order to preserve it (circumventing the existence of tachyons). In the second quantization framework,\nstability is related to the energy positivity of the Fock states for any momentum. Here, stability is directly associated\nwith the energy positivity of each mode read off from the DR.\nThe field propagators, given by eqs. (25, 27, 26), present three families of poles at k 2 :\nk 2 = 0; k 2 \u2212 s2 = 0; k 4 \u2212 (s2 \u2212 v.v)k 2 \u2212 (v.k)2 = 0,\nfrom which one straightforward infers the DR derived from the Lagrangian (5), namely:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\n\u0001\n\u21922\n\u2212\n\u21922\n\u2212\n\u21922 1\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ns \u2212 v.v \u00b1 (s \u2212 v.v) + 4 (v.k) .\nk0(1) = k ; k0(2) = k + s ; k0(3) = k +\n2\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\nThe first dispersion relation, k0 = \u00b1 |k |, stands for a massless photon mode, which carries no degree of freedom,\nsince the\nqLagrangian (5) involves a massive photon. The second DR represents the Chern-Simons massive mode,\n\u2192\n\u2212\nk0 = \u00b1 s2 + | k |2 , which propagates only one degree of freedom (in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics\nthe scalar magnetic field encloses all information of the electromagnetic field, which justifies the existence of a single\ndegree of freedom). These first two poles apparently respect the causality condition, since k 2 \u2265 0 for them. Once the\ncausality is set up, the stability comes up as a direct consequence.\nConcerning the third DR, corresponding to the roots of \u22a0(k), it may provide both massless and massive modes\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nfor some specific k -values, but in general, the mode is massive. By remembering that k is the transfer momentum,\nwhose values are generally integrated from zero to infinity, one concludes it does not make much sense to fix any\n6\n\n\f\u2192\n\u2212\nvalue for k in order to obtain a particular dispersion relation. Remarking that the term \u22a0(k) is ubiquitous in the\ndenominator of all propagators, as it is explicit in eqs. (25),(26), (27), one concludes the causal structure entailed to\n\u2192\nthe poles of 1/\u22a0 will be common to these three propagators. Specifically, for a purely space-like 3-vector, v \u03bc = (0, \u2212\nv ),\nthis DR is written as,\n\"\n#\nr\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u21922 1\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\ns +\u2212\nv \u00b1\ns2 + \u2212\nv\n+4 \u2212\nv.k\n.\n(31)\nk0\u00b1 = k +\n2\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\nA simple analysis of this expression indicates that both k0+\nand k0\u2212\nare positive-energy modes for any k -value\n(and for any Lorentz observer), which assures the stability of these modes. This fact may suggest that the causal\nstructure of the space-like sector of this model remains preserved, as it was observed by Adam & Klinkhamer [5] in\nthe context of the 4-dimensional version of this theory, that is endowed with a dispersion relation very similar to eq.\n(31) (this conclusion was also supported by the attainment of a group velocity, associated to this mode, smaller than\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\n1). Concerning the pole analysis, although, we have k+\n> 0 for arbitrary k and k\u2212\n< 0 (unless k \u22a5\u2212\nv or k = 0,\n2\n2\n2\nwhich implies k\u2212\n= 0). So, while the mode k+\npreserves the causality and stability, the mode k\u2212\n, in spite of assuring\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nstability, will be in general non-causal, preserving causality only when k \u22a5 v or k = 0.\n\u2192\n\u2212\nIn the case of a purely time-like 3-vector, v \u03bc = (v0 , 0 ), the DR assumes the form:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0011 q\n1 \u0010 2\n\u21922\n\u2212\n\u21922\n\u2212\n2\n\u00b1 s4 + 4vo2 k ,\n=\nk0\u00b1\ns +2k\n(32)\n2\n\n2\n2\nwhere one observes a similar behaviour: the mode k0+\nwill exhibit stability and causality, while the mode k0\u2212\nwill\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\npresent energy positivity (for arbitrary k -value) whenever the condition, s \u2212 v0 > 0, is fulfilled. From now on,\n2\none must assume the validity of this condition, so that the mode k0\u2212\ncan be taken stable. This latter mode is\n\u2192\n\u2212\nnon-causal for \u0001any k 6= 0. Assuming the coefficients for Lorentz violation are small near the Chern-Simons mass\n\u2192\ns2 \u226b v02 , |\u2212\nv |2 , we obtain an entirely causal theory (at least at zero order in v 2 /s2 ). This is consistent with some\nresults [8] concerning some quantum theories containing Lorentz-violating terms, which evidence the preservation of\ncausality when the breaking factors are small.\n2\nHence, the modes k0\u00b1\nexhibit positive energy both in space- and time-like cases, which also implies these two\nmodes can be written as an expansion in terms of positive and negative frequency terms. This separation allows the\ndefinition of particles and antiparticles states, a necessary condition for the quantization of this theory. Nevertheless,\nthe existence of non-causal modes, both in time- and space-like case, may be seen already at classical level, as a\nprediction on the impossibility to realize a consistent quantization of this model, an issue that will be properly\naddressed when one analyses the unitarity at these non-causal poles. Therefore, the existence of quantization illness\nwill be solved by investigating the unitarity of the model, matter to be discussed in the next section.\nIn a Lorentz covariant framework, k 2 is a Lorentz scalar, which assures a unique value for all Lorentz frames. In\nsuch a way, if k 2 represents a causal mode for one observer, so it will be for all ones. The fact that k 2 has not a\npositive definite value in an arbitrary Lorentz frame is a unequivocal indicative of the Lorentz covariance breakdown.\n\nIV. UNITARITY ANALYSIS\n\nIn order to analyze the unitarity of the model at tree-level, one has adopted the method which consists in saturating\nthe propagators with external currents. The fact that our model possesses two sectors (the scalar and gauge one)\nimplies that we must saturate the scalar-propagator and the gauge-propagator individually. In such a way, we write\nthe two saturated propagators, namely:\nSPhA\u03bc A\u03bd i = J \u2217\u03bc hA\u03bc (k)A\u03bd (k)i J \u03bd ,\nSPh\u03c6\u03c6i = J \u2217 h\u03c6\u03c6iJ,\nwhere the gauge current J \u03bc must obey the conservation law valid for the gauge sector of the system3 , whereas the\nscalar current, J, is not subject to any constraint. The unitarity analysis is based on the residues of SP, precisely: the\n\n3\n\nBy applying the differential operator, \u2202\u03bc , on the equation of motion derived from Lagrangian (5), there results the following\nequation (see ref. [11]) for the gauge current: \u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = \u2212\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bc v\u03bd \u2202\u03c1 \u03c6, which reduces to the conventional current-conservation\nlaw, \u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = 0, whenever v \u03bc is constant or has a null rotational (\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bc v\u03bd = 0).\n\n7\n\n\funitarity is ensured whenever the imaginary part of the residues of SP at the poles of each propagator is positive. It\nis easy to notice that the saturated propagator in the momentum-space is the current-current transition amplitude.\nA. Scalar Sector\n\nWe can initiate our analysis by the scalar sector, whose saturated amplitude is given by: SPh\u03c6\u03c6i = J \u2217 h\u03c6\u03c6iJ, or\nmore explicitly:\nSPh\u03c6\u03c6i = J \u2217\n\ni(k 2 \u2212 s2 )\nJ.\n\u22a0(k)\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n2\n2\nThis expression presents two poles, k+\n, k\u2212\n, the roots of\u0014\u22a0(k) = 0. At the purely\ntime-like case, v \u03bc = (v0 , 0 ), these\n\u0015\nq\n\u21922\n\u2212\n2\npoles are exactly the ones given by eq. (32): k\u00b1\n= 12 s2 \u00b1 s4 + 4vo2 k . Evaluating the residues of SPh\u03c6\u03c6i at\n\n2\n2\nthe pole k+\none achieves a positive imaginary result, while at the pole k\u2212\na positive result appears only when the\n\u21922\n\u2212\ncondition k < (v02 + s2 ). In such a way, one concludes that the unitarity of the scalar sector, in the time-like case,\n\u2192\nis not assured.\nConsidering now the purely space-like\ncase, v \u03bc = (0, \u2212\nv ), the poles of SPh\u03c6\u03c6i are given by eq. (31):\n#\n\"\nr\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00012\n\u0001\n\u2192 2\n\u2212\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nk\u00b1\n= 12 s2 + \u2212\ns2 + \u2212\nv2 +4 \u2212\nv.k\n. The residues associated with these two poles exhibit a positive\nv2 \u00b1\n\ndefinite imaginary part, so that one can state that the unitarity of the scalar sector, at the space-like case, is generically\npreserved.\nB. Gauge-Field sector\n\nThe continuity equation, \u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = 0, in the k-space is read as: k\u03bc J \u03bc = 0; it allows us to write the current in the\nform: J \u03bc = (j 0 , 0, kk02 j (0) ). The conservation constraint, j (2) = kk02 j (0) , appears whenever one adopts k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k2 )\nas the momentum. The current conservation law also reduces to six the number of terms of the photon propagator\nthat contributes to the evaluation of the saturated propagator:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0001\ni\n\u2217\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\u03bc\nSPhA\u03bc A\u03bd i = J\u03bc (k)\nJ\u03bd (k),\n(33)\n\u0003 \u22a0 g \u2212 s \u22a0 S \u2212 s \u0003\u039b + \u0003T T \u2212 s\u0003Q + s\u0003Q\nD\nwhere: D = \u0003(\u0003 + s2 ) \u22a0 . Writing this expression in the momentum-space, one obtains:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2217\u03bc\nSPhA\u03bc A\u03bd i = J (k) iB\u03bc\u03bd J \u03bd (k),\n\n(34)\n\n2\n\nwhere: D = k 2 (k 2 \u2212 s2 )\u22a0, with: \u22a0 (k) = k 4 \u2212 (s2 \u2212 v.v)k 2 \u2212 (v.k) .\n1. Time-like case:\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\nWe start by analyzing the unitarity in the case corresponding to a time-like background-vector: v \u03bc = (v0 , 0 ). In\nthis situation, the 2-rank tensor B\u03bc\u03bd can be put in the form:\n\u0001\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nk 2 (s2 v02 \u2212 \u22a0) \u0001\nik (1) (\u2212s \u22a0 +v02 s2 k 2 )\nik (2) s \u22a0 \u2212v02 s2\u0001k 2\n1 \uf8f0 (2)\n(2) \uf8fb ,\nB\u03bc\u03bd (k) =\n(35)\nis \u22a0 k (0) \u2212 v02 k 2 k (1)\nik\n\u2212s \u22a0 +v02 s2 k 2\nk 2 \u22a0 + v02 k22\n\u0001 k\nD(k)\n(1)\n2 2 2\n2\n2 2\n(0)\n2\n2\n(1)\n(2)\nik (s \u22a0 \u2212v0 s k ) \u2212is \u22a0 k \u2212 v0 k k k\nk \u22a0 + v0 k1\n\nwhere: \u22a0 = k 4 \u2212 (s2 \u2212 v02 )k 2 \u2212 k02 .\nFor the pole k 2 = 0, with k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k0 ), we have the following residue matrix:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u2212isk0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\u2212isk0 \uf8fb ,\nB\u03bc\u03bd |(k2 =0) = 2 \uf8f0 isk0\ns\nisk0\n0\n0\n8\n\n(36)\n\n\fwhich is reduced to a null matrix when saturated with the conserved current, J \u03bc = (j 0 , 0, kk20 j (0) ), implying also a null\nsaturation (SP = 0). This fact indicates that the mode associated with the pole k 2 = 0 carries no physical degree of\nfreedom, and further, it does not jeopardize the unitarity.\nFor the pole k 2 = s2 , with k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k2 ), the matrix takes the form,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n2 2\nk0 \u2212isk (2) k02\n0\n1 \uf8f0 s (2)\n(37)\nB\u03bc\u03bd |(k2 =s2 ) = \u2212 2 2 isk k02\n0\n\u2212isk0 k22 \uf8fb ,\ns k2\n2\n0\nisk0 k2\n\u2212s2 k22\nThis matrix, whenever saturated with the external current J \u03bc = (j 0 , 0, kk20 j (0) ), leads to a trivial saturation (SP = 0),\nwhich is compatible with unitarity requirements. The vanishing of the current-current amplitude at this pole indicates\n2\nthat the massive excitation\nkq\n= s2 is not \u0015dynamical for the time-like background.\n\u0014\n\u21922\n\u2212\n2\nAt the pole k+\n= 12 s2 + s4 + 4vo2 k , the residue matrix reads as:\n2 )\nB\u03bc\u03bd |(k2 =k+\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns2\n\u2212is2 k (2) 0\nv02\n\uf8f0 is2 k (2)\n= 2\nk22\n0 \uf8fb,\n2 \u2212 k2 )\n(k+ \u2212 s2 )(k+\n\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n\n(38)\n\nwhich has as eigenvalues \u03bb1 = 0, \u03bb2 = 0, \u03bb3 = k22 + s2 . Consequently, one has SP > 0 (unitarity preservation). At the\n2\npole k\u2212\n, a similar behaviour occurs: one obtains a residue matrix exactly equal to the one given above. The difference\n2\n2\n2 \u22121\n\u2212 s2 )(k\u2212\n\u2212 k\u2212\n)] > 0.\nrests only on the coefficient appearing in front of the matrix, in this case: D(k1 \u2212 ) = v02 [(k\u2212\n2\nThe fact that this last coefficient results positive indicates that the unitarity is also preserved at the pole k 2 = k\u2212\n,\nonce one has the same eigenvalues. Here, the situation presents a peculiarity with respect to its (1 + 3)-dimensional\ncounterpart: according to the analysis of the works [5], [7], for a time-like background vector, the gauge sector is\nalways plagued by ghost states which cannot be removed by any gauge choice. They actually spoil the unitarity.\n2. Space-like Case:\n\nIn this case, taking v \u03bc = (0, 0, v), the tensor B\u03bc\u03bd is given as follows:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u2212k 2 (\u22a0 \u2212 v 2 k12 )\nis \u22a0 k (2) \u2212 k 2 v 2 k0 k (1) ik (1) (\u2212s \u22a0 \u2212sk 2 v 2 )\n1 \uf8f0\nB\u03bc\u03bd (k) =\n\u2212is \u22a0 k (2) \u2212 k 2 v 2 k0 k (1)\nk 2 (\u22a0 + v 2 k02 )\nisk0 (\u22a0 + v 2 k 2\u0001) \uf8fb ,\nD(k)\n(1)\n2 2\n2\nik (s \u22a0 +sk v )\n\u2212is \u22a0 k0 + iskv k0\nk 2 \u22a0 + v 2 s2\n\n(39)\n\nwhere: \u22a0 = k 4 \u2212 (s2 \u2212 v 2 )k 2 \u2212 v 2 k22 .\nFor the pole k 2 = 0, with k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k0 ), one obtains the same matrix attained in the time-like case, given by eq.\n(36). Exactly by the same reasons presented at this former section, one can assert that the unitarity is preserved at\nthis pole.\nFor the pole k 2 = s2 , with k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k2 ), the resulting matrix is identical to one given by eq. (37), so that the\nconclusions established in the time-like case are also valid here. The vanishing of the saturated propagator at the pole\n2\nk 2 = s2 , in both cases,\"indicates thatr\nthe massive excitation k 2 =\n# s is not dynamical in our model.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u00012\n\u2192 2\n\u2212\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nv2 \u00b1\nFor the pole k+\n= 12 s2 + \u2212\ns2 + \u2212\nv2 +4 \u2212\nv.k\n, with k \u03bc = (k0 , 0, k2 ), the residue matrix is reduced\nto:\n\n2 )\nB\u03bc\u03bd |(k2 =k+\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n0\nv2\n\uf8f0 0 k02 isk0 \uf8fb ,\n= 2\n2 \u2212 k2 )\n(k+ \u2212 s2 )(k+\n\u2212\n0 \u2212isk0 s2\n\n(40)\n\nq\n2\n2\n2\nwhere: (k+\n\u2212 k\u2212\n) = (s2 + v 2 ) + 4v 2 k22 . The eigenvalues of this matrix are: \u03bb1 = 0, \u03bb2 = 0, \u03bb3 = k02 + s2 , which\n2\nleads to a positive saturation (SP > 0) , and then unitarity is guaranteed at this pole. For the pole k\u2212\n, unitarity is\nalso ensured, this may be seen in an exactly similar way to the one performed in the time-like case.\nTaking into account all results concerning the gauge sector of this model, one concludes that the unitarity is\npreserved in both time- and space-like cases (at all the poles of the gauge propagator) without any restriction.\n9\n\n\fConsidering the restriction on the unitarity of the scalar sector at the time-like case, one can state that our entire\nmodel preserves unitarity only in the space-like case. It is also interesting to note that the unitarity of the gauge\n2\nsector is guaranteed even at the non-causal poles k\u2212\n, which confirms the consistency of our model. This fact can be\n2\nunderstood remembering that the modes k\u2212 , in spite of being non-causal, are stable ones.\nV. CONCLUDING COMMENTS\n\nWe have accomplished the dimensional reduction to 1+2 dimensions of a gauge invariant, Lorentz and CPT-violating\nmodel, defined by the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03ba\u03bb v\u03bc A\u03bd F\u03ba\u03bb . One then obtains a Maxwell-Chern-Simons planar\nLagrangian in the presence of a Lorentz breaking term and a massless scalar field. Concerning this reduced model,\nthe CPT symmetry is conserved for a purely space-like v \u03bc , and spoiled otherwise. The propagators of this model are\nevaluated and exhibit a common causal structure (bound to the dependence on 1/\u22a0). The poles of the propagators\nare used as starting point for the analysis of causality, stability and unitarity. Concerning the dispersion relations, one\nverifies that the modes have positive definite energy, which ensures stability. The causality is assured for all modes of\n2\nthe theory, except for k\u2212\n(both in space- and time-like case). In connection with the unitarity of this model, one has\nanalyzed the scalar and the gauge sectors separately, by means of the saturation of the residue matrix. The gauge\nsector has revealed to be unitary for time- and space-like background vectors, whereas the scalar sector has showed\nto preserve unitarity only in the space-like case. We should now pay attention to a special property of 3-space-time\ndimensions, namely: the absence of ghosts in the gauge-field spectrum for a time-like, v \u03bc . Unitarity is a relevant\nmatter and an essential condition for a consistent quantization of any theory. Once the unitarity is here ensured, this\nmodel may become a useful and interesting tool to analyze planar systems (including Condensed-Matter ones) with\nanisotropic properties.\nA new version of this work [10] may address the dimensional reduction of a gauge-Higgs model [7] in the presence\nthe Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In this case, the reduced model will be composed by two scalar fields (one stemming\nfrom the dimensional reduction, the other being the Higgs scalar), by a Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca gauge field, and\nby the Lorentz-violating mixing term. The introduction of the Higgs sector may shed light on new interesting issues\nconcerning planar systems, like the investigation of vortex-like configurations in the framework of a Lorentz-breaking\nmodel.\nAnother natural investigation consists in studying the solutions to the classical equations of motion (the extended\nMaxwell equations) and wave equations (for the potential A\u03bc ) corresponding to the reduced Lagrangian. It is possible\nthat such equations reveal a similar structure (but more complex) to the MCS conventional Electrodynamics, since\nthe reduced Lagrangian indeed contains the MCS sector. The solution to these equations may unveil some interesting\n\u2192\naspects, such as the property of anisotropy (induced by a space-like background, \u2212\nv ) in the interaction potential\nderived from such equations. This issue is actually being investigated and we shall report on it in a forthcoming paper\n[11].\nVI. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nManoel M.
