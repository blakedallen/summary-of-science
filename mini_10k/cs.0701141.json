We give such a definition for sets; as intervals are sets, the definition applies to intervals as a\nspecial case.\n\nExpressions are not functions. Confusing the two\nconcepts or failing to define the function that is computed by an expression weakens the rigour of interval\narithmetic. We give such a definition and continue\nwith the required re-statements and proofs of the fundamental theorems of interval arithmetic and interval\nanalysis.\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nAn expression is an entity consisting of symbols; it\nis an element of a formal language in the sense of computer science. Some of these symbols denote operations; others are constants or variables and denote reals\nor intervals, according to the chosen interpretation.\nUnlike an expression, a numerical function is an element of the function space Rn \u2192 R, for a suitable\npositive integer n. Variables only occur in expressions,\nwhere they can re-occur any number of times. Variables do not occur in functions; in fact, the notion of\n\"occurs in\" is not applicable to functions in Rn \u2192 R.\nInstead, a function in Rn \u2192 R is a map from n-tuples\nof reals to reals; the elements of the n-tuples are properly called arguments, rather than \"variables\".\nAn additional reminder of the need to distinguish\nbetween expressions and functions is that different expressions can compute the same function. Yet another\nreminder is that there exist functions that are not computable, whereas all expressions are, like programs, instructions for computations. Contrary to programs in\ngeneral, expressions of the type of interest to interval\narithmetic can be evaluated in finite time. Hence the\nfunctions computed by these expressions belong to the\ncomputable subset of functions.\nOf course, \"the set of expressions\" could be made\nprecise by means of a formal grammar. For the purpose\nof this paper, it is sufficient to define an expression as\nfollows.\n1. A variable is an expression.\n2. If E is an expression and if \u03c6 is a unary operation\nsymbol, then \u03c6E is an expression.\n3. If E1 and E2 are expressions and if \u22c4 is a binary\noperation symbol, then E1 \u22c4 E2 is an expression.\nTo make the definition formal, we would have to spell\nout the appearance of the variables and of the operation\nsymbols.\n\nIntroduction\nMake things as simple as possible,\nbut not simpler.\nAlbert Einstein.\n\nThe raison d'\u00eatre of interval arithmetic is rigour.\nYet it appears that the most fundamental fact, sometimes referred to as the \"Fundamental Theorem of Interval Arithmetic\", is not rigorously established. The\nfact in question can be described as follows.\nLet e be an expression with hx1 , . . . , xn i as an ordered set of variables (i.e. a finite sequence of distinct\nvariables). Let f be the function in Rn \u2192 R that is\ncomputed by e. Let the result of evaluating e with\nintervals I1 , . . . , In substituted for x1 , . . . , xn be an interval Y . Then\n{f (x1 , . . . , xn ) | x1 \u2208 I1 , . . . , xn \u2208 In } \u2282 Y\n\nExpressions and functions\n\n(1)\n\nAlthough this fact is fundamental to everything that\nis done in interval arithmetic, we have failed to find\nin the literature a definition of what it means for an\nexpression to compute a function. In Section 1.2 we\nreview the literature that we consulted.\nIn (1) the interval Y is typically considerably wider\nthan the range of function values. Interval analysis\nrelies on the fact that, as I1 , . . . , In become narrower,\nthe sides in (1) become closer to each other. A theorem\nto this effect, such as 2.1.1 or 2.1.3 in [9] deserves to\nbe called Fundamental Theorem of Interval Analysis\nrather than interval arithmetic.\nBoth theorems should rest on the foundation provided by a definition of the function computed by an\n1\n\n\fIn whatever way expressions are defined, the resulting set is disjoint from the set Rn \u2192 R, whatever n\nis. What is needed to turn the Fundamental Fact (1)\ninto a theorem is to define \"function computed by an\nexpression\" as a mapping from the set of expressions\nin n variables to Rn \u2192 R. As observed above, this\nmapping is neither injective nor surjective. This mapping can be called the semantics of the language of\nexpressions.\n\n1.2\n\nRemarks on the literature\n\nMoore [8] avoids the problem of defining the function defined by an expression by not making the distinction. As explained in the previous section, this is\nnot correct. Jaulin et. al. [6], Theorem 2.2, assume\nthat the problem is taken care of by composition of\nfunctions, but make unjustified simplifications. Composition is indeed a promising approach, which we will\npursue in Section 4.\nNeumaier [9] does distinguish between expressions\nand functions, but the expressions as he defined them\nfail to be computable. In fact, following the definition\nhe gave in page 13, every real number is an element\nof the set of arithmetical expressions. The simplicity\narises from the fact that all real numbers are defined as\n(sub)expressions. This introduces infinite expressions:\nwhatever notation is chosen for the reals, most (in the\nsense of a subset of measure one) are infinite. In this\nway effective computability is lost.\nMoreover, Neumaier starts with an arithmetic expression f , and then defines the interval evaluation\nof f , which he denotes by the same symbol f . To\ndeal with partial functions, he introduced a NaN symbol, and the results of operations on this symbol. He\nthen defined the restriction of f to its real domain\nDf = {x \u2208 Rn | f (x) 6= N aN } to be the real evaluation of f . We do not see the need for this indirect\napproach: partial functions are a perfectly natural and\nhardly novel generalization of functions that are total.\nRatschek and Rokne also distinguish expressions\nfrom functions. In [12] they refer to their earlier book\n[11] for a definition. This is a mistake, because on\npage 23, after a heuristic discussion of the connection\nbetween expression and functions, they refer to texts in\nlogic and universal algebra for a definition. However,\nthese assume that all functions are total. This is not\nalways the case for the expressions of\u221ainterest to interval arithmetic; consider for example x. As only a few\nexotic varieties of logic allow function symbols to be\ninterpreted by partial functions, it is better for interval\narithmetic to use set theory as basis for its fundamental theorems. In fact, these exotic varieties are subject\nto considerable controversy [2, 10], so not suitable as a\n\nfundament for interval analysis.\n\n2\n\nSet theory preliminaries\n\nThis section establishes the concepts, terminology\nand notation for this paper. It is necessary because the\npresent investigation is unusual in that all functions are\nwhat are usually called \"partial functions\". To avoid\nhaving to qualify with \"partial\" every time a function\nis mentioned, we define \"function\" to mean what is\nusually referred to as \"partial function\". In other respects, we adhere closely to standard expositions of set\ntheory, such as [3, 1] and standard introductions such\nas found in authoritative texts such as [7].\nDefinition 1 A function f consists of a source, a target, and a map. The source and target are sets. The\nmap associates each element of a subset of the source\nwith a unique element of the target.\nThe set of functions with source S and target T is\ndenoted by the term S \u2192 T . If a function f \u2208 S \u2192 T\nassociates x \u2208 S with y \u2208 T , then one may write y as\nf (x). When only the association under f between x\nand y is relevant, we write x 7\u2192 y.\nExample 1 The square root is a function in R \u2192 R\nthat does not associate any real with any negative real\nand associates with x \u2208 R the unique non-negative y \u2208\nR such that y 2 = x if x \u2265 0.\nThe term f (x) is undefined if there is no y \u2208 T\nassociated with x \u2208 S by f \u2208 S \u2192 T . We take {f (x) |\nx \u2208 S} to mean\n{y \u2208 T | \u2203x \u2208 S and f associates y with x}.\nThat is, {f (x) | x \u2208 S} is defined even though f (x)\nmay not be defined for every x \u2208 S.\n\u221a\nExample 2 { x | x \u2208 R} is defined and is the set of\nnon-negative reals.\n{x/y | x \u2208 {1} and y \u2208 R} is defined and is R\\ {0}.\nThe subset of S consisting of x with which f \u2208 S \u2192\nT associates a y \u2208 T is called the domain of f , denoted\ndom(f ). If dom(f ) = S, then f is said to be a total\nfunction. {f (x) | x \u2208 S} is called the range of f .\nWe introduced the unusual terms \"source\" for S and\n\"target\" for T because of the need to distinguish them\nfrom \"domain\" and \"range\".\nDefinition 2 The set of functions with source S and\ntarget T is denoted S \u2192 T and is called a \"type\" or\n\"function space\".\nAgain, this differs from the usual meaning of S \u2192 T ,\nwhere it only contains total functions. To say that f\n\"is of type\" S \u2192 T means that f \u2208 S \u2192 T .\n\n\fDefinition 3 Let f \u2208 S \u2192 T and g \u2208 T \u2192 U . The\ncomposition g \u25e6 f of f and g is the function in S \u2192 U\nsuch that g \u25e6 f associates x \u2208 S with z \u2208 U iff there\nexists a y \u2208 T such that f maps x to y and g maps y\nto z.\nThis is the conventional definition of composition.\nIt requires the target of f to be the same set as the\nsource of g. Because of this requirement it is not clear\nwhat composition Jaulin et. al. have in mind in [6],\nTheorem 2.2.\nIt follows from Definition 3 that the domain of definition of f \u25e6 g is a subset of that of f .\nExample 3 f \u25e6 g \u25e6 h has {0}\n\u221a as domain if f \u2208 R \u2192 R\nis such that it maps x 7\u2192 x, g \u2208 R \u2192 R is such that\nit maps x 7\u2192 \u2212x, and h \u2208 \u221a\nR \u2192 R is such that it maps\nx 7\u2192 |x|. In other words, (\u2212|x|) is undefined for all\nx \u2208 R except when x = 0.\nLet f \u2208 S \u2192 T . The elements of S are called \"arguments\" of f . Note that if a function associates an x in\nS with a y in T , it only so associates a single element of\nS. In that respect, all functions are \"single-argument\"\nfunctions. But S and T may be any sets whatsoever.\nSuppose f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R. Now the single elements in\nthe source of f , the arguments of f , are n-tuples of\nreals. Thus we interpret the usual f (x1 , . . . , xn ) as\nf (hx1 , . . . , xn i).\n\nDefinition 4 Let f1 \u2208 S1 \u2192 T1 and f2 \u2208 S2 \u2192\nT2 . The Cartesian product of f1 and f2 , denoted\nf1 \u00d7 f2 , is a function in S1 \u00d7 S2 \u2192 T1 \u00d7 T2\nhaving domain dom(f1 ) \u00d7 dom(f2 ) = {hx1 , x2 i |\nx1 \u2208 dom(f1 ) and x2 \u2208 dom(f2 )}, and mapping every\nhx1 , x2 i in dom(f1 ) \u00d7 dom(f2 ) to hf1 (x1 ), f2 (x2 )i.\n\nDefinition 5 Let f be a function in S \u2192 T . Let F be\na total function in P(S) \u2192 P(T ). F is a set extension\nof f iff {f (x) | x \u2208 X} \u2282 F (X) for all subsets X\nof S. The total function in P(S) \u2192 P(T ) with map\nX 7\u2192 {f (x) | x \u2208 X} is a set extension and is called\nthe canonical set extension of f . We will use f (D) to\ndenote {f (x) | x \u2208 D}.\n\n3. Intervals are sets - interval extensions are set extensions\nAs we saw, partial functions have set extensions that\nare total. This is of particular interest in numerical\ncomputation, where some important functions, such as\ndivision and square root, are not everywhere defined.\nIn some treatments of interval arithmetic this leads\nto the situation in which division by an interval containing zero is not defined. This is not necessary: if\n\none regards an interval as a set and an interval extension as a set extension, then the interval extension is\neverywhere defined. This is the approach taken in [5],\nwhich will be summarized here.\nA well-known fact is that the closed, connected sets\nof reals have one of the following forms: {x \u2208 R | x \u2264\nb}, {x \u2208 R | a \u2264 x}, {x \u2208 R | a \u2264 x \u2264 b}, as well\nas R itself. Here a and b are reals. Note that the\nempty subset of R is an interval also, as no ordering is\nassumed between a and b.\nThe closed, connected sets of reals are defined to be\nthe real intervals. They are denoted [\u2212\u221e, b], [a, \u221e],\n[a, b], and [\u2212\u221e, \u221e]. These notations are just a shorthand for the above set expressions. They are not meant\nto suggest that, for example, \u2212\u221e \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, b] = {x \u2208 R |\nx \u2264 b}. This is not the case because [\u2212\u221e, b] is a set of\nreals and \u2212\u221e is not a real.\nThe floating-point numbers are a set consisting of\na finite set of reals as well as \u2212\u221e and \u221e. The real\nfloating-point numbers are ordered as among the reals.\nThe least (greatest) element in the ordering is \u2212\u221e (\u221e).\nThe floating-point intervals are the subset of the real\nintervals where a bound, if it exists, is a floating-point\nnumber. We assume that there are at least two finite\nfloating-point numbers. As a result, the empty subset\nof R is also a floating-point interval.\nThe floating-point intervals have the property that\nfor every set of reals there is a unique least floatingpoint interval that contains it. This property can be\nexpressed by means of the function \u2737 so that \u2737S is\nthe smallest floating-point interval containing S \u2282 R.\nGiven a real number x, we denote by x\u2212 the greatest\nfloating-point number not greater than x, and by x+\nthe least floating-point number not less than x.\nBy themselves, set extensions are not enough to obtain interval extensions. They need to be used in conjunction with the function \u2737, as in the following definition of interval addition:\nX + Y = \u2737{z \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y .x + y = z}\n\n(2)\n\nfor all floating-point intervals X and Y . Compared\nwith a definition such as\n[a, b] + [c, d] = [(a + c)\u2212 , (b + d)+ ],\n\n(3)\n\n(which is equivalent for bounded intervals) (2) has the\nadvantage of being applicable to unbounded intervals\nwithout having to define arithmetic operations between\nreal numbers and entities that are not real numbers.\nMoreover, (2) includes the required outward rounding.\nSimilarly to (2) we have\nDefinition 6\nX +Y\n\ndef\n=\n\n\u2737{z \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y .x + y = z}\n\n\fX \u2212Y\nX \u2217Y\nX/Y\n\u221a\nX\n\ndef\n=\ndef\n=\ndef\n=\ndef\n=\n\n\u2737{z \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y .z + y = x}\n\u2737{z \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y .x \u2217 y = z}\n\u2737{z \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y .z \u2217 y = x}\n\u2737{y \u2208 R | \u2203x \u2208 X.y 2 = x}\n\nTheorem 1 The functions defined in Definition 6\nmap floating-point intervals to floating-point intervals,\nare defined for all argument floating-point intervals,\nand are set extensions of the corresponding functions\nfrom reals to reals.\nThis is a summary of several results in [5].\nDefinition 7 Let I be the set of intervals. F \u2208 I n \u2192 I\nis an interval extension of f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R iff F is the\nrestriction to domain I n \u2282 Rn \u2192 R of a set extension\nof f . F is the canonical interval extension of f is defined to be F (B) = {f (x) | x \u2208 B} whenever this is an\ninterval.\n\n4. Semantics of expressions via set theory\nAs all but a few exotic varieties of logic restrict functions to be total, we develop the semantics of expressions on the basis of set theory, even though most treatments of set theory also restrict functions to be total.\nHowever, as we have seen, functions in the usual set\ntheory are easily generalized so that totality is not assumed. Modifying logic so that function symbols can\nbe interpreted by partial functions has graver repercussions [2, 10].\nSuppose that the expression e has the form e1 +\ne2 and that e1 computes f1 : Rm \u2192 R and that e2\ncomputes f2 : Rn \u2192 R. In such a situation, Jaulin\net al. [6] (Theorem 2.2), suggest that the function f\ncomputed by e is the composition of +, f1 and f2 .\nBut such a composition is not possible, as the types\ndo not match, as required in Definition 3. We can make\na composition if we form the Cartesian product of f1\nand f2 and if we make additional assumptions about\ne1 and e2 . To prepare these assumptions we need the\nfollowing definition.\nDefinition 8 Let {v1 , . . . , vn } be the set of variables in\nexpression e. The variable sequence of e is hv1 , . . . , vn i\nif the first occurrences of the variables in e are ordered\naccording to this sequence.\nConsider the special case where m = n and where\ne1 and e2 have the same variable sequence. Let \u03b4 \u2208\nRn \u2192 Rn \u00d7 Rn with mapping\nhx1 , . . . , xn i 7\u2192 hhx1 , . . . , xn i, hx1 , . . . , xn ii\n\nAs will be shown in Lemma 1, the function computed\nby e1 +e2 is +\u25e6(f1 \u00d7f2 )\u25e6\u03b4. The types of \u03b4, f1 \u00d7f2 , and\n+ do match: they are, respectively, Rn \u2192 (Rn \u00d7 Rn ),\n(Rn \u00d7 Rn ) \u2192 R2 , and R2 \u2192 R. Thus it is clear the\ncomposition is defined and that its type is Rn \u2192 R.\nBut it is of course a very special case if e1 and e2\nhave the same variables in the same order of first occurrence. To further illustrate what is needed to define\na composition of +, e1 , and e2 , consider another special\ncase: e1 and e2 have no variables in common, and their\nvariable sequences are hv1 , . . . , vm i and hw1 , . . . , wn i,\nrespectively. As will be shown in Lemma 1, the function computed by e1 + e2 is again + \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4,\nexcept that \u03b4 is in Rm+n \u2192 Rm \u00d7 Rn and has as map\nhx1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , yn i 7\u2192 hhx1 , . . . , xm i, hy1 , . . . , yn ii\nNow the types of \u03b4, f1 \u00d7 f2 , and +, are, respectively,\nRm+n \u2192 (Rm \u00d7 Rn ), (Rm \u00d7 Rn ) \u2192 R2 , and R2 \u2192 R.\nThus it is clear that the composition is defined and that\nits type is Rm+n \u2192 R.\nFinally, an example where the subexpressions share\nsome, but not all variables. Consider the example\nwhere e1 is x \u2217 y, e2 is y \u2217 z, e is e1 + e2 , and\n\u03b4 \u2208 R3 \u2192 (R2 \u00d7 R2 ) is such that \u03b4 maps as follows:\nhx1 , x2 , x3 i 7\u2192 hhx1 , x2 i, hx2 , x3 ii for all x1 , x2 , x3 \u2208 R.\nNow the functions f1 and f2 computed by e1 and e2\nare the same function in R2 \u2192 R: it has as map\nhs, ti 7\u2192 s \u2217 t for all reals s and t. Yet the function\ncomputed by e1 + e2 does not have as map s \u2217 t + s \u2217 t:\nit is a different function, which is, however, described\nby the same formula + \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4.\nThese three examples suggest how to define in general, for any pair he1 , e2 i of expressions and any domain\nD of interpretation, a \"distribution function\" that represents the pattern of co-occurrences of variables in e1\nand e2 .\nDefinition 9 Given expressions e1 and e2 with variable sequences hv1 , . . . , vm i and hw1 , . . . , wn i, respectively. Let D be a set of values suitable for substitution\nfor the variables. Let {i1 , . . . , ip } and let {j1 , . . . , jq } be\na partition in {1, . . . , n} such that {wi1 , . . . , wip } occur\nin e1 and {wj1 , . . . , wjq } do not occur in e1 1 .\nThe distribution function \u03b4 for the pair he1 , e2 i and\nD is the function in Dm+q \u2192 Dm \u00d7 Dn that has as\nmap\nhx1 , . . . , xm , yj1 , . . . , yjq i 7\u2192 hhx1 , . . . , xm i, hy1 , . . . , yn ii\nfor all x1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , yn in D.\n1 Hence the variable sequence of any expression of the form\ne1 hoperation symbolie2 is hv1 , . . . , vm , wj1 , . . . , wjq i.\n\n\fDefinition 10 An interpretation for an expression\nconsists of a set D (the domain of the interpretation)\nand a map M that maps every n-ary operation symbol\nin the expression to a function in Dn \u2192 D.\nA set extension I \u2032 of I is said to be continuous if\nevery symbol p is mapped to a continuous set extension\nof M (p). I \u2032 is said to be canonical if every n-ary operation symbol p is mapped to a canonical set extension\nof M (p).\nThe distribution function specifies enough of the\nway variables are shared between two expressions to\nsupport the central definition of this paper:\nDefinition 11 Let e be an expression and let I be an\ninterpretation that maps each n-ary operation symbol\nin e to a function in Dn \u2192 D, for n \u2208 {1, 2}. We\ndefine by recursion on the structure of e, distinguishing\nthree cases.\nSuppose e is a variable. The function computed by\ne under I is the identity function on D.\nSuppose e is \u03c6e1 where \u03c6 is a unary operation symbol. The function computed by e under I is f \u25e6f1 , where\nf is the function in D \u2192 D that is the result of mapping by I of \u03c6 and where f1 is the function computed\nby e1 under I.\nSuppose e has the form e1 \u22c4 e2 , where \u22c4 is a binary\noperation symbol. Suppose \u03b4 is the distribution function\nfor he1 , e2 i and D. The function computed by e under\nI is \u2738 \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4, where \u2738 is the result of mapping\nby I of \u22c4.\n\nThe definition assumes that no constants occur in\nexpressions. We can simulate a constant by replacing it\nby a new variable and substituting the constant for that\nvariable. In this way the definition does not suffer a\nloss of generality for expressions consisting of variables,\nconstants, unary operators, and binary operators. At\nthe expense of cumbersome notation (or sophisticated\nmethods to avoid this), the function \u03b4 can be extended\nto cover n-ary operation symbols with n > 2.\nThe definition should conform to our intuition about\nexpression evaluation. Suppose that D is the set of integers, that the functions computed by e1 and e2 yield\n2 and 3, respectively. Then the definition should ensure that the function computed by e1 + e2 yields 5\nwhen the interpretation maps + to addition over the\nintegers. The following lemma confirms this intuition\nin general for arbitrary binary operation symbols.\nLemma 1 Let e1 \u22c4 e2 be the expression in Definition 11.\nSuppose that ha1 , . . . , am i \u2208 Dm is\nsubstituted for hx1 , . . . , xm i and that hb1 , . . . , bn i \u2208\nDn is substituted for hy1 , . . . , yn i. Let hc1 , . . . , cq i\nbe such that ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i is substituted for\nhx1 , . . . , xm , y1 , . . . , yq i.\n\nIt is the case that\nf (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)\n= f1 (ha1 , . . . , am i)\u2738f2 (hb1 , . . . , bn i),\nwhere f is the function computed by e1 \u22c4 e2 according\nto Definition 11.\nProof:\nf (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)\n\n(\u2738 \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4)(ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)\n(\u2738 \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ))\u03b4(ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i))\n\n(\u2738 \u25e6 (f1 \u00d7 f2 ))hha1 , . . . , am i, hb1 , . . . , bn ii\n\u2738((f1 \u00d7 f2 )(hha1 , . . . , am i, hb1 , . . . , bn ii)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nf1 (ha1 , . . . , am i)\u2738f2 (hb1 , . . . , bn i).\n\nLemma 2 Let I be an interpretation for expression e\nand let I \u2032 be a set extension of I. Let f (f \u2032 ) be the\nfunction computed by e under the interpretation I (I \u2032 ).\nThen f \u2032 is a set extension of f .\nThough a minor lemma in set theory, the special\ncase where the domains of I and I \u2032 are the reals and\nintervals respectively, it plays the role of the Fundamental Theorem of Interval Arithmetic2 .\nProof: We proceed by induction on the depth of the\nexpression. Suppose the lemma holds for all expressions of depth at most n \u2212 1. Let n be such that at\nleast one of e1 and e2 is of depth n \u2212 1 and the other is\nof depth at most n \u2212 1. Suppose I has domain D and\nmap M . Let e be e1 \u22c4 e2 and suppose that M maps \u22c4\nto \u2738. Let \u03b4 be the distribution function of e1 and e2 in\nthat order. Let f1 and f2 be the functions computed\nby e1 and e2 , respectively, under I. Let f1\u2032 and f2\u2032 be\nthe functions computed by e1 and e2 , respectively, under I \u2032 . This gives as induction assumption that f1\u2032 and\nf2\u2032 are set extensions of f1 and f2 .\nLet f and f \u2032 be the functions computed from\ne1 \u22c4 e2 under interpretations I and I \u2032 , respectively. Let A1 , . . . , Am , B1 , . . . , Bn be subsets of D\ncontaining the elements a1 , . . . , am , b1 , . . . , bn . Let\nc1 , . . . , cq be such that \u03b4 maps ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i\nto hha1 , . . . , am i, hb1 , . . . , bn ii.\nSupposing that \u2738\u2032 is a set extension of \u2738, we have\nf (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)\n\nf1 (a1 , . . . , am )\u2738f2 (b1 , . . . , bn )\n\u2032\nf1 (A1 , . . . , Am )\u2738\u2032 f2\u2032 (B1 , . . . , Bn )\nf \u2032 (A1 , . . . , Am , C1 , . . . , Cq ),\n\n=\n\u2208\n=\n\n2 Except that the statement in [4] inadvertently states instead\nthe definition of interval extension.\n\n\fwhich is the function computed by e under I \u2032 . Both\nequalities are justified by Lemma 1.\nTheorem 2 Let e be an expression with a variable sequence hx1 , . . . , xn i. Let I be an interpretation for e,\nand I \u2032 a canonical set extension of I. Let f (f \u2032 ) be the\nfunction computed by e under the interpretation I (I \u2032 ).\nIf each variable xi occurs only once in e, then f \u2032 is the\ncanonical set extension of f .\nProof: Following the same steps and notation as in\nthe previous proof, we have\nf \u2032 (A1 , . . . , Am , B1 , . . . , Bn ) =\n(by Lemma 1)\nf1\u2032 (A1 , . . . , Am )\u2738\u2032 f2\u2032 (B1 , . . . , Bn ) =\n(by the induction assumption)\nf1 (A1 , . . . , Am )\u2738\u2032 f2 (B1 , . . . , Bn ) =\nf1\u2032\n\nf2\u2032\n\n(using that\nand\nare canonical set extensions and\nthat e1 and e2 have no variables in common)\n{y \u2208 D | \u2203y1 \u2208 f1 (A1 , . . . , Am ),\n\u2203y2 \u2208 f2 (B1 , . . . , Bn ).y = y1 \u2738y2 }\n\n=\n\n{y \u2208 D | \u2203a1 \u2208 A1 , . . . , \u2203am \u2208 Am ,\n\n\u2203b1 \u2208 B1 , . . . , \u2203bn \u2208 Bn .\ny = f1 (a1 , . . . , am )\u2738f2 (b1 , . . . , bn ) =\nf (a1 , . . . , am , b1 , . . . , bn )} =\nf (A1 , . . . , Am , B1 , . . . , Bn ).\n\n5. Continuous set extensions\nA fundamental fact in interval analysis can be stated\nintuitively as\nWe can get arbitrarily close to the range of\nthe point evaluation of an expression e by\ncomputing the interval evaluation of e with\na sufficiently narrow interval.\nSo far we were only concerned with interval arithmetic.\nThis fact, being a continuity property, gets us into the\nrealm of analysis. So it is here that interval analysis\nbegins.\nAs the validity of the statement and proof of such a\nproperty depends on a rigorous definition of the function computed by an expression, it is wise to revisit the\nconcepts and the theorems.\nDefinition 12 Let F be a family of sets of D. A sequence S = hSn in\u2208N of subsets of D converges with\nrespect\nto F if it is nested, belongs to F , and satisfies\nT\nS\nn\u2208N n = {a}, where a is an element of D. We say\nthat the singleton set {a} is the limit of S.\n\nDefinition 13 Let F \u2208 P(S) \u2192 P(T ), and let F1 and\nF2 be two families of sets of S and T , respectively.\nLet A = hAn in\u2208N be any convergent sequence w.r.t.\nF1 with limit {a}. F is continuous w.r.t. F1 and F2\nin {a} iff hF (An )in\u2208N is a convergent sequence w.r.t.\nF2 .\n\nContinuity is a very strong requirement. This raises\nthe concern that no interesting examples might exist.\nThe next lemma shows that this concern is unnecessary.\n\nDefinition 14 Let f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R, and let k.k be the\nEuclidean norm on Rn . The function f is Cauchycontinuous at c \u2208 Rn iff for every \u01eb > 0 there exists a\n\u03b4 > 0 such that kx \u2212 ck \u2264 \u03b4 and x \u2208 dom(f ) imply that\n|f (x) \u2212 f (c)| \u2264 \u01eb.\nA sequence hxi ii\u2208N with xi \u2208 Rn for all i \u2208 N is\nCauchy-convergent to \u03be \u2208 Rn iff for every \u01eb > 0 there\nexists an n such that k\u03be \u2212 xi k \u2264 \u01eb for all i > n.\nLemma 3 Let f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R be Cauchy-continuous\nat every x \u2208 dom(f ) and suppose f has a canonical\ninterval extension F . Then F is continuous w.r.t. the\nfamily of boxes of Rn , and the family of intervals of R.\nProof : Suppose that x is an element of Rn , and that\nhBn in\u2208N is a sequence of boxes in I n that converges\nto x w.r.t. the family of boxes of Rn . To prove that\nF is continuous w.r.t. the family of boxes of Rn , and\nthe family of intervals of R, we have to show that the\nsequence hF (Bn )in\u2208N converges w.r.t. the family of intervals of R. It is clear that this sequence is nested\nand belongs to the family\nT of intervals of R. So, we\nonly need to show that n\u2208N F (Bn ) is a singleton. In\nfact,\n\\\nF (Bn ) = {f (x)}.\nn\u2208N\n\nThe following inclusion is obvious: T {f (x)} \u2282\nT\nn\u2208N F (Bn ). Let y be an element of\nn\u2208N F (Bn ).\nThis implies that for every n \u2208 N , there exists xn\nin Bn such that f (xn ) = y. Because (Bn )n\u2208N is a\nnested sequence of boxes that intersect in {x}, the sequence (xn )n\u2208N Cauchy-converges to x. Since f is\nCauchy-continuous\nat x, we have f (x) = y. Therefore,\nT\nn\u2208N F (Bn ) \u2282 {f (x)}, which proves the lemma.\nLemma 4 Let f \u2208 S \u2192 T , and let F1 and F2 be two\nfamilies of sets of S and T , respectively. Let F be a\ncontinuous set extension of f w.r.t. F1 and F2 and let\nA = hAn in\u2208N be a convergent sequence w.r.t. F1 with\nlimit {a}. Then F ({a}) = {f (a)}.\nProof : As F is continuous w.r.t. F1 and F2 ,\nhF (An )in\u2208N is a convergent sequence w.r.t. F2 with\nlimit, say, {b}. As F is a set extension of f we have\n\n\fthat {f (x) | x \u2208 Ai } \u2282 F (Ai ), for all i \u2208 N . As a \u2208 Ai\nfor all i \u2208 N , we have thatTf (a) \u2208 {f (x) | x \u2208 Ai } for\nall i \u2208 N . Hence f (a) \u2208 i\u2208N F (Ai ) = {b}. So we\nmust have f (a) = b.\nWe are interested in interval extensions that are not\ncanonical, yet are continuous.\nStarting from a family F of sets of a set D, we can\nconstruct a family of sets Fn of Dn , for any natural\nnumber n, by taking all the Cartesian products of any\nn sets in F . So, for any natural number n, and for\nany function F \u2208 P(Dn ) \u2192 P(D), we can study the\ncontinuity of F w.r.t. Fn that was constructed from F .\nIn this way, we treat the continuity of F by referring\nto F instead of Fn .\nIn what follows, we suppose that the family of sets F\nof the domain D of an interpretation is given, and that\nthe continuity of a set extension of an n-ary operation is\nbased on this family. So, we will not use \"w.r.t.\" from\nnow on. In the case where D is R, F is the family of\nintervals in R.\n\nDefinition 15 Let I be an interpretation with domain\nD and map M . A set extension I \u2032 of I is said to be\ncontinuous if every symbol p is mapped to a continuous\nset extension of M (p). I \u2032 is said to be a canonical\ninterval extension of I iff every symbol p is mapped to\na canonical interval extension of M (p).\n\nTheorem 3 Let e be an expression. Let I be an interpretation for e, and let I \u2032 be a continuous set extension\nof I. Let f (F ) be the function computed by e under\nthe interpretation I (I \u2032 ). Then F is a continuous set\nextension of f .\nProof: From Lemma 2, the function F is a set extension of f . So we only need to prove that F is continuous. To do so, we proceed by induction on the depth\nof the expression e. The theorem holds when e has no\nsubexpressions, that is, when e is a variable. In that\ncase f and F are the identity functions, independently\nof I and I \u2032 . The identity function in P(D) \u2192 P(D) is\ncontinuous.\nThis takes care of the base of the inductive proof.\nLet the induction assumption be that the theorem\nholds for all expressions of depth at most d \u2212 1. Let\ne be the expression e1 \u22c4 e2 , where one of the subexpressions has depth d \u2212 1 and the other has depth at\nmost d \u2212 1. Suppose that the interpretation I has\ndomain D and maps \u22c4 to \u2738. Let the interpretation\nI \u2032 have P(D) as domain and let it map \u22c4 to \u2738\u2032 , a\ncontinuous set extension of \u2738. Let \u03b4 be the distribution function with D for e1 and e2 in that order. Let\nc1 , . . . , cq be such that \u03b4 maps ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i\nto hha1 , . . . , am i, hb1 , . . . , bn ii.\n\nLet F , F1 , and F2 be the functions computed\nunder I \u2032 by e, e1 , and e2 , respectively. Suppose\nthat hAi1 ii\u2208N , . . . , hAim ii\u2208N and hB1i ii\u2208N , . . . , Bni ii\u2208N\nare sequences of subsets of D that converge respectively to {a1 }, . . . , {am } and {b1 }, . . . , {bn }.\nAccording to the induction assumption F1 and F2\nare continuous set extensions. This implies that\nhhF1 (Ai1 , . . . , Aim ), F2 (B1i , . . . , Bni )iii\u2208N converges to\n{hf1 (a1 , . . . , am ), f2 (b1 , . . . , bn )i}, by Lemma 4.\nLet hC i ii\u2208N be any such that \u03b4(C i )\n=\nhhAi1 , . . . , Aim i, hB1i , . . . , Bni ii and such that hC i ii\u2208N\nconverges to {hha1 , . . . , am i, hb1 , . . . , bn i}\nWe show that F is a continuous set extension of f by showing that hF (C i )ii\u2208N converges\nto {f (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)}. To do so, we need\ni\nto show that\nT the sequence hF (C )ii\u2208N is nested,\nand that\ni\u2208N F (Ci ) is the right value, namely\n{f (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)}.\nF (C i+1 ) =\n(by Definition 11)\n(\u2738\u2032 \u25e6 (F1 \u00d7 F2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4)(C i+1 ) =\n(by application of \u03b4)\ni+1\ni+1\ni+1\n(\u2738\u2032 \u25e6(F1 \u00d7F2 ))(hhAi+1\n1 , . . . , Am i, hB1 , . . . , Bn ii) =\n\n(by Definition 4)\ni+1\ni+1\ni+1\n\u2738\u2032 (hF1 (hAi+1\n1 , . . . , Am i), F2 (hB1 , . . . , Bm i)i) \u2282\n\n(by the induction assumption and continuity of \u2738\u2032 )\ni\n\u2738\u2032 (hF1 (hAi1 , . . . , Aim i), F2 (hB1i , . . . , Bm\ni)i) = F (C i ),\n\nwhich proves that hF (C i )ii\u2208N is nested. As for the\nconvergence to the right value, we observe the following:\n\\\nF (C i ) =\ni\u2208N\n\n(by Definition 11)\n\\\n(\u2738\u2032 \u25e6 (F1 \u00d7 F2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4)(C i ) =\ni\u2208N\n\n(by application of \u03b4)\n\\\n(\u2738\u2032 \u25e6 (F1 \u00d7 F2 ))(hhAi1 , . . . , Aim i, hB1i , . . . , Bni ii) =\ni\u2208N\n\n(by Definition 4)\n\\\ni\n\u2738\u2032 (hF1 (hAi1 , . . . , Aim i), F2 (hB1i , . . . , Bm\ni)i) =\ni\u2208N\n\n\f(by continuity of \u2738\u2032 )\n\\\n\\\ni\n\u2738\u2032 (h\nF1 (hAi1 , . . . , Aim i),\nF2 (hB1i , . . . , Bm\ni)i) =\ni\u2208N\n\ni\u2208N\n\n(by the induction assumption)\n\u2738\u2032 (h{f1 (ha1 , . . . , am i)}, {f2 (hb1 , . . . , bn i)}i) =\n(by Lemma 4)\n{f1 (ha1 , . . . , am i)}\u2738{f2 (hb1 , . . . , bn i)} =\n(because f is the function computed by e1 \u22c4 e2 )\n{f (ha1 , . . . , am , c1 , . . . , cq i)},\nwhich shows that F = \u2738\u2032 \u25e6 (F1 \u00d7 F2 ) \u25e6 \u03b4 is a continuous\nset extension of f , the function computed by e.\nCorollary 1 Let f \u2208 Rn \u2192 R be the function computed by an expression e under an interpretation I that\nassigns Cauchy-continuous functions to the operation\nsymbols in e. Let F be the function computed by e under the canonical interval extension of I. Let hAi ii\u2208N\nbe nested boxes converging to {a}. Then hF (Ai )ii\u2208N is\na sequence of nested intervals converging to {f (a)}.\nIn interval analysis, this corollary plays the role of Fundamental Theorem.\nProof: Since the image of any box by a Cauchycontinuous function is an interval, the interval extension associated with each operation symbol is canonical\n(every Cauchy-continuous function has a canonical interval extension). Using Lemma 3, these interval extensions are continuous. By Theorem 3, F is continuous.\nBy Definition 13, hF (Ai )ii\u2208N converges to {f (a)}.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe fact that the result of an expression evaluation\nin intervals gives a result that contains the range of values of the function computed by the expression cannot\nbe a mathematical theorem without a mathematical\ndefinition of what it means for a function to be computed by an expression. In this paper we give such a\ndefinition and prove the theorem on the basis of it.\nAnother fundamental assumption in the use of intervals is that, as we make the intervals in an interval\nevaluation of an expression narrower, the interval result gets closer to the range of values of the function\ncomputed by the expression. We use our definition to\nprove a theorem to this effect.\nOur starting point in all this is that intervals are sets\nand that, therefore, interval extensions of functions are\nset extensions of functions. The latter concept is an old\n\none in set theory and is more widely applicable. Our\ndefinition and two main theorems are stated in terms\nof sets, so apply to intervals as special cases.\nThis is of course only of interest to those who believe in sets as foundation of mathematics. A radically\ndifferent approach to the fundamental theorems of interval analysis is found in Paul Taylor's work (see for\nexample [13]). Here the starting point is topology, axiomatically founded rather than set-theoretically.\nIf it seems that our proposed foundations for interval methods are overly complex in comparison with the\nway they are given in the literature, we are comforted\nby Einstein's dictum: Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research was supported by the University of\nVictoria and by the Natural Science and Engineering\nResearch Council of Canada.
