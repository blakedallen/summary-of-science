They are important for testing theories of star formation and of stellar\nevolution in the presence of nearby companions. We obtained 218 days of Kepler photometry of HD 181068 (magnitude of 7.1), supplemented by groundbased spectroscopy and interferometry, which show it to be a hierarchical\ntriple with two types of mutual eclipses. The primary is a red giant that is in a\n45-day orbit with a pair of red dwarfs in a close 0.9-day orbit. The red giant\nshows evidence for tidally-induced oscillations that are driven by the orbital\nmotion of the close pair. HD 181068 is an ideal target for studies of dynamical\nevolution and testing tidal friction theories in hierarchical triple systems.\nThe Kepler space mission is designed to observe continuously more than 105 stars, with the\nultimate goal of detecting a sizeable sample of Earth-like planets around main-sequence stars\n(1). We obtained 218 days of Kepler photometry (2\u20134) of HD 181068, a star with magnitude\nV = 7.1 and a distance of about 250 pc. It has been previously identified as a single-lined\nspectroscopic binary (5) but there have been no reports of eclipses.\nThe data were obtained in long-cadence (LC) mode (one point every 29.4 minutes) over 218\ndays using Quarters 1, 2 and 3. Our observations reveal a very distinctive light curve. It shows\neclipses every \u223c22.7 days and slow variations in the upper envelope (in Fig. 1a) that are likely\ncaused by ellipsoidal distortion of the primary component. There are also very regular and much\nnarrower eclipses (Fig. 1b). These minima have alternating depths, corresponding to a close pair\n(B and C), with an orbital period of \u223c0.9 d. The 22.7-d eclipses all have similar depths, but there\nare subtle differences between consecutive minima. Radial velocity observations (Supporting\nOnline Material, SOM) show that the true orbital period of the BC pair around the A component\nis 45.5 d. The narrow 0.9-d eclipses essentially disappear during both types of the deep minima,\nimplying that the three stars have very similar surface brightnesses, so that when the BC pair\nis in front of A, their mutual eclipses do not change the total amount of light coming from the\n3\n\n\fDifferential magnitude\n\n1.38\n\n(a)\n\n1.4\n1.42\n1.44\n\nDifferential magnitude\n\n55000\n\n55050\n\n55100\n\n(b)\n1.4\n1.41\n\n55020\n\n55022\n\n55024\n\n55026\n\n55028\n\n55030\n\n55032\n\n(c)\n\n55034\n55036\nBJD - 2400000\n\n55038\n\n55040\n\n55042\n\n55044\n\n55046\n\n(d)\n\n1.42\n\nDifferential magnitude\n\n55150\n\n1.40\n1.41\n\n1.43\n\n54975\n1.4\n\n55048\n\n54978\n\n55044\n\n55046\n\n(f)\n\n(e)\n\n1.41\n1.42\n\n1.41\n\n1.43\n\n55020\n\n55022\n\n55024\n\n55134\n\n55136\n\n55138\n\nBJD - 2400000\n\nFigure 1: Kepler-band light curve of HD 181068 from observations in long-cadence mode: (a)\nthe full 218 days; (b) a 28-d segment showing two consecutive deep minima.

When the BC\npair is in front of A, the BC's secondary eclipses appear as tiny brightenings (Fig. 1d and f),\nshowing that the surface brightness of B is almost equal to that of A, while C is a bit fainter, so\nthat its disappearance behind B allows the extra light from A to reach us.\nThe observed changes in the eclipses of the BC pair and the radial velocity variations of the\nA component confirm that the A and BC systems are physically associated and not a chance\nalignment. Their periods are PBC =0.90567(2) d and PA-BC = 45.5178(20) d. Given the shallow\ndepths of the eclipses, star A must be the most luminous object in the system. In addition to\nthe eclipses, there are brightness fluctuations during the long period minima which imply that\ncomponent A is also an intrinsic variable star with a mean cycle length close to half the shorter\norbital period, possibly indicating tidally-induced oscillations.\nIn addition, there were several flare-like events in the light curve that usually lasted about\n6-8 hours. We checked the Kepler Data Release Notes (7) for documented instrumental effects\nin the vicinity of the 'flares', but found none. Moreover, almost all flares appear right after the\nshallower minimum of the BC pair, suggesting that this activity might be related to the close\npair.\nWe looked for optically resolved companion(s) with a 1-m telescope (SOM), but found\nnone. We also obtained 41 high-resolution optical spectra to measure the orbital reflex motion\nof the A component (SOM). The orbital parameters for the wider system (Table 1) reveal that\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: Squared visibility versus spatial frequency from PAVO on CHARA. Grey points show\nall collected measurements, and black symbols the average of each scan over all wavelength\nchannels. Each symbol type corresponds to a different night of observations. The solid line is\nthe best fitting model. The inset shows a close-up of the observations at the longer baselines.\n\nstar A revolves on a circular orbit, which has an orbital period twice the separation of the two\nconsecutive flat-bottomed minima in the light curve (SOM). Long-baseline interferometry using\nthe PAVO beam combiner (Precision Astronomical Visible Observations, (8)) at the CHARA\nArray (Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy, (9)) show that the angular diameter\nof HD 181068 A, corrected for limb darkening (10) is \u03b8LD = 0.461 \u00b1 0.011 milli-arcsecond\n(Fig. 2).\nCombining the measured angular diameter with the Hipparcos parallax of 4.0 \u00b1 0.4 mas\n(11), we find the linear radius of the primary component to be R = 12.4 \u00b1 1.3R\u2299 . Using\nthe spectroscopically determined Teff = 5100 \u00b1 200 K, this a luminosity of L = 93 \u00b1 19L\u2299 .\nThis value matches that found from the Hipparcos parallax and the apparent magnitude. We\nalso estimated the absolute magnitude of HD 181068 A based on the Wilson-Bappu effect (12),\nwhich correlates the width of the chromospheric Ca II K emission line at 3934 \u00c5 with the V band absolute magnitude. Using the latest calibration (S5), the measured width of the emission\ncore W0 =72.8 km/s implies an absolute brightness of MV = \u22120.3 mag, which matches the\nparallax and the interferometric results.\n6\n\n\fWe estimated the mass of HD 181068 A by comparing the effective temperature and luminosity with evolutionary tracks from the BASTI database (14). We obtained MA \u223c 3.0\u00b10.4M\u2299 ,\ncorresponding to a red giant, possibly in the He-core burning phase of its evolution (15). The\nfull spectral energy distribution, constructed using all published broad-band optical magnitudes\nand infrared flux values, does not show any excess in comparison to a 5200 K photospheric\nmodel, indicating that no detectable circumstellar dust, possibly from mass-loss processes on\nthe red giant branch, is present.\nWe have constrained the parameters of the BC pair by modelling the short-period eclipses\nin the Kepler band using the\n\nJKTEBOP\n\ncode (16, 17). The ratio of the radii of the B and C\n\ncomponents is poorly constrained at present, partly because of the low sampling rate of the\nKepler long-cadence data. The A component contributes 99.29% of the system light in the\nKepler passband, and the BC pair contribute 0.44% and 0.27%, respectively. Taking the V band absolute magnitude of HD 181068 A to be MV (A) = \u22120.3 and assuming that our results\nfor the Kepler passband are representative of the V -band, we find MV (B) = 5.6 and MV (C) =\n6.1. Such absolute magnitudes indicate spectral types of G8 V and K1 V for stars B and C,\nrespectively (18). Since we do not have independent measurements of Teff for the BC pair, we\ncan only estimate their masses based on their spectral types. This indicates that their masses are\nabout 0.7\u00b10.1 M\u2299 each (SOM).\nOne puzzling feature of the system is the short-period fluctuations that have the largest\namplitudes when the BC pair is behind star A, while remaining apparent with a slowly changing\namplitude in all the other phases of the wide orbit. We have investigated this variability of\nHD 181068 A with a detailed frequency analysis and a comparison to other red giant stars that\nhave similar properties (SOM). The frequency content of the light curve suggests an intimate\nlink to tidal effects in the triple system, with the first four dominant peaks in the power spectrum\nidentifiable as simple linear combinations of the two orbital frequencies. On the other hand,\nsolar-like oscillations (meaning those excited by near-surface convection, as in the Sun but also\n\n7\n\n\fobserved in red giants) that are expected to produce an equidistant series of peaks in the power\nspectrum, are not visible, even though all stars with similar parameters in the Kepler database\ndo show clear evidence of these oscillations. In other words, the convectively driven solar-like\noscillations that we would expect to see in a giant of this type seem to have been suppressed.\nIn a recent compilation of 724 triple stars (19), there is only one system with an outer orbital period shorter than that of HD 181068 (\u03bb Tau, for which Pout =33.03 d). (20) has reported\nthe discovery of KOI-126 with similarly short outer period (Pout =33.92 d). Extremely compact hierarchical triple systems form a very small minority of hierarchical triplets, with only\n7 of the catalogized 724 systems having outer periods shorter than 150 days. Furthermore,\nHD 181068 and KOI-126 have the highest outer mass ratios (\u223c2.1 and 3, respectively, defined\nas mA /(mB + mC ) among the known systems. In 97% of the known hierarchical triplets before the Kepler era, the mass of the close binary exceeded that of the wider companion, and\neven the larger outer mass ratio remained under 1.5. It is not yet clear if this rarity of such\nsystems is caused by an observational selection effect or has an underlying stellar evolutionary\nor dynamical explanation.\nIts properties make HD 181068 an ideal target for dynamical evolutionary studies, and for\ntesting tidal friction theories. Because of its compactness and its massive primary, we can expect\nshort-term orbital element variations on two different time-scales of 46 days (i.e. with period of\n2\nPA-BC ), and approximately 6 years (PA-BC\n/PBC ), the time-scale of the classical apsidal motion\n\nand nodal regression (21), which for the triply eclipsing nature, could be observed relatively\neasily.\n\nReferences\n1.

For this, we took over 100,000 short-exposure frames on\n2010 June 28/29 and June 29/30, using an Andor IXonEM +888 EMCCD, with exposure times of\n30\u201361 ms in UBV (RI)C filters. The median seeing was about 1.6\u2032\u2032 . In each filter we obtained\n10,000\u201330,000 frames, from which the best 0.3% was selected and combined. The resulting\nimages show clean single-star profiles with typical FWHM of 0.9\u2032\u2032 in U, 0.64\u2032\u2032 in V and 0.45\u2032\u2032\nin IC . For the latter, we have also determined contrast limits at representative separations. An\nanalysis of simulated artificial stars with a wide range of brightnesses and separations resulted\nin the following upper limits to the magnitude difference of a hypothetic optical companion:\n0.4\u2032\u2032 \u2013 2.1 mag; 0.8\u2032\u2032 \u2013 2.9 mag;1.2\u2032\u2032 \u2013 5 mag; 2.0\u2032\u2032 \u2013 6.4 mag.\n\nA.2\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nTo measure the orbital motion of HD 181068 A, we acquired optical spectra at four different\nobservatories. We obtained 41 spectra in total, as follows: 6 spectra with the FIES spectrograph\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT; resolution 47 000, wavelength range 3623\u20137270 \u00c5); 14\nspectra at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO; resolution 10 000 and wavelength\nrange 4300\u20134556 \u00c5); 16 spectra with the 2-m telescope at the Th\u00fcringer Landessternwarte\n(TLS) in Tautenburg (resolution 66 000, wavelength range 4700\u20137400 \u00c5); and 5 spectra at the\nMcDonald Observatory (McD) using the 2.7m telescope and the Robert G. Tull coud\u00e9 spectrograph (resolution 60 000 and wavelength range 3700\u201310000 \u00c5).\nFrom the light curve, we know that HD 181068 A contributes almost all the light of the\ntriple system. We fitted theoretical template spectra from the library of (S1) to a NOT spectrum\n\n11\n\n\fand determined the following parameters: Teff = 5100 \u00b1 200 K, log g = 2.8 \u00b1 0.3, [M/H] =\n\u22120.6 \u00b1 0.3 and v sin i = 14 km s\u22121 . These values are all in good agreement with those of (S2).\nAs a check, we can also use Str\u00f6mgren photometry from (S3): V = 7.091, b \u2212 y = 0.586,\nm1 = 0.296 and c1 = 0.399. From these quantities and the calibration of (S4), we find:\nTeff = 5200 K, E(b \u2212 y) = 0.087 and (b \u2212 y)0 = 0.499. These numbers are consistent with the\nspectroscopic results and confirm that HD 181068 A is a G-type giant star.\nWe have used one high-quality NOT spectrum to measure the width of the Ca II K emission\nline at 3934 \u00c5. This has been done interactively with the IRAF task SPLOT after converting the\nwavelength scale to Doppler velocities around the core of the emission. The measured value is\nW0 = 72.8 km s\u22121 , which was then used to calculate the V -band absolute magnitude via the\ncalibration of the Wilson-Bappu effect by (S5).\nRadial velocities were determined using the IRAF task FXCOR. The template for all but the\nTLS spectra was selected from (S1), with closely matching parameters, which ensured that no\nsystematic errors were introduced by spectral template mismatch. The 16 TLS RVs have been\ndetermined in a first step from cross-correlation with the mean spectrum that was iteratively built\nfrom the single spectra by shift-and-add according to the measured RVs. This mean spectrum\nwas then analysed using the program LL MODELS (S6) to compute a grid of stellar atmosphere\nmodels and the program S YNTH V (S7) to compute the synthetic spectra. We found Teff =\n5300 \u00b1 100K, log g = 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 dex, [M/H] = \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.1, and v sin i = 14 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 .\nFinally, we used the best-fit synthetic spectrum as a template for cross-correlation to determine\nthe RVs of the TLS spectra on an absolute scale. Depending on the instrument and the spectra,\nthe velocities are accurate to \u00b10.5\u20132 km s\u22121 . The observed radial velocities and their deviations\nfrom the orbital fit are listed in Table S2.\nThe orbital solution (see Fig. S3) was calculated by the method of differential corrections.\nWe omitted the DAO RVs because they show a much larger scatter around the calculated orbital\ncurve, despite being observed during the same epoch as the other instruments.

We also\nfixed the orbital period to that obtained from the light-curve fitting (a free search gives a slightly\ndifferent value but does not improve the quality of the solution). Table 1 lists the derived orbital\nelements. In the corresponding solution, we corrected the NOT RVs by \u22120.35 km s\u22121 and the\nMcDonald RVs by \u22120.70 km s\u22121 with respect to the TLS RVs. This correction minimized the\nrms to 214 m s\u22121 , and its influence on the derived elements was only marginal.\n\nA.3\n\nInterferometry\n\nInterferometric observations were performed on three nights in 2010 July, using two different\nbaselines (156.3 m and 248.1 m) of the CHARA Array. All the observations were performed\noutside the long-period eclipses, meaning that some flux from the BC pair was present during\nall observations. With an eclipse depth of only 1%, however, the companions are much fainter\nthan the primary and are negligible in our analysis. The raw data were reduced using the PAVO\ndata analysis pipeline.\nWe obtained 7 scans of HD181068 over 23 wavelength channels spanning from 0.65 to 0.8\n\n14\n\n\fmum each, yielding a total of 161 V2 measurements. We observed six stars of spectral type A0\nto calibrate the raw visibilities. All stars were located within 5\u25e6 in the sky and their estimated\ndiameters were at least a factor of 2 smaller than HD 181068A. Inspection of the data revealed\nthat three of the calibrators (HD179395, HD182487 and HD181521) are potential binaries and\ncould not be used for calibration. The remaining three stars used to calibrate our data were\nHD179733, HD180138 and HD184787. To determine the angular diameter of HD181068 A a\nlimb-darkened disc model (S8) was fitted to the calibrated visibilities. The corresponding linear\nlimb-darkening coefficient was determined by interpolating the spectroscopically determined\nvalues of log g and Teff in the grid of (S9), yielding \u03bc = 0.63 \u00b1 0.02. The resulted angular\ndiameter of HD181068 A is \u03b8LD = 0.461 \u00b1 0.011 milli-arcsecond.\nThe uncertainty on the diameter was estimated using 40000 Monte-Carlo simulations as\nfollows: For each simulation, we drew realizations corresponding to Gaussian distributions for\nthe calibrator angular diameters, limb-darkening coefficient and wavelength channels, with assumed standard deviations of 5%, 3% and 0.5%. With these parameters we then calibrated the\nraw visibility measurements and fitted an angular diameter to the calibrated data using leastsquares minimization. To account for random errors, including correlations between wavelength channels, we perturbed this fit by adding random numbers generated from the empirical\ncovariance matrix of the data and then repeated the fit (S10). The final uncertainty was taken\nas the standard deviation of the resulting total distribution, scaled by square root of the reduced\n\u03c72 value (2.5) as determined from the fit to the original data. The measurements of the 7 scans\naveraged over 23 wavelength channels are listed in Table S3.\n\nA.4\n\nHD 181068 B and C\n\nWe have constrained the parameters of the BC pair by modelling the short-period eclipses in the\nKepler band. First, we removed the long-term variations of the uneclipsed brightness in the light\ncurve by fitting spline function polynomials and removing data obtained during the long-period\n\n15\n\n\fTable S3: Calibrated interferometric measurements of HD181068 averaged over 23 wavelength\nchannels for each scan.

In this way, the light from star A was assigned to be the 'third light' component. The\nparameters of the BC pair were deduced by modelling the short-period eclipses in the Kepler\nband using the\n\nJKTEBOP\n\ncode (S11, S12). A preliminary fit was performed, allowing a few\n\noutlying data points to be identified and removed. A detailed fit was then made, using numerical\nintegration to account for the 30-minute long duration of individual observations. Uncertainties\nin the parameters of the fit were calculated using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (S13). In each\nsimulation, a synthetic dataset was created by evaluating the best-fitting model at the observed\ntimes and adding Gaussian noise. This was then fitted in the same way as the real data, starting\nfrom initial parameter values which were perturbed versions of the best-fitting parameter values.\nThe error estimate for each fitted parameter was then evaluated by taking the inner 68.3% of\nall the values of the parameter found from the synthetic datasets. The resulting photometric\nparameters are given in Table S4.\nWe found the ratio of the radii of the B and C components to be poorly constrained at\npresent, partly due to the low sampling rate of the Kepler long-cadence data. The A component\ncontributes 99.29% of the system light in the Kepler passband, and the BC pair contribute\n0.44% and 0.27%, respectively. Taking the V -band absolute magnitude of HD 181068 A to be\nMV (A) = \u22120.3 and assuming that our results for the Kepler passband are representative of the\nV -band, we find MV (B) = 5.6 and MV (C) = 6.1. Such absolute magnitudes indicate spectral\n16\n\n\fTable S4: Photometric parameters obtained for the short-period eclipses, using standard symbols in the study of eclipsing binary systems.

Fig. S4 shows a Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram with\nBASTI evolutionary tracks (S14) of different masses for [M/H] = \u22120.25 (as suggested from\nthe spectroscopy), as well as the most likely locations of the components of the triple system.\nThe position of the BC components was derived based on the spectral types stated above, assuming an error of 200 K in Teff and 0.2 mag in absolute magnitude, respectively.\n\nB The variability of HD 181068 A\nThe light curve (see Fig. 1) shows slow variations with the same timescale as the long-period\neclipses, which presumably arise from ellipsoidal distortion of the primary. We also see faster\noscillations with the same timescale as the orbital period of the BC pair. These are visible both\noutside and during the eclipses and are less obvious to interpret.\nTo investigate this further, Fig. S5a shows the amplitude spectrum of the light curve after\nfirst removing observations made during both the long- and short-period eclipses. This procedure left a light curve with a duty cycle slightly above 60%, and it introduced alias peaks in the\n17\n\n\fFigure S4: A Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram using the BASTI tracks (S14) for [M/H] = \u22120.25.\nIt shows the locations of components A, B and C, marked by the filled square, diamond and\ncircle, respectively.\n\namplitude spectrum at the multiples of the orbital frequencies. The strongest peak in the spectrum occurs at 25 \u03bcHz, corresponding to half the orbital period of the BC binary. As mentioned,\nthis periodicity is clearly visible in the light curve.\nTo search for other frequencies we used iterative sine-wave fitting (prewhitening) with Period04 (S15). In five steps, we measured and identified the following frequencies:\n\u2022 f1 = 24.54 \u03bcHz = 2(fshort \u2212 2flong )\n\u2022 f2 = 25.05 \u03bcHz = 2(fshort \u2212 flong )\n\u2022 f3 = 25.56 \u03bcHz = 2fshort\n\u2022 f4 = 51.12 \u03bcHz = 4fshort\n\u2022 f5 = 12.83 \u03bcHz = fshort + 1/Tobs\nHere, fshort = 1/PBC , flong = 1/PA-BC , and Tobs is the time span of observations. Fig. S5b\nshows the amplitude spectrum after the slow variations and these five strongest peaks have been\n18\n\n\fsubtracted from the time series.\nCould the observed signal in HD 181068 arise from solar-like oscillations? According to the\nparameters derived from the interferometry and spectroscopy, HD 181068 A is a red giant star\nlocated in the bottom of the red giant branch. Studies of similar red giants with Kepler (S16,S17)\nshow that essentially all stars in this region of the H-R diagram exhibit solar-like oscillations\nthat appear as a broad power excess centred at a characteristic frequency \u03bdmax and composed of\na regularly spaced series of peaks. Using the scaling relation of (S18) with the derived values\nof mass, radius and effective temperature, we estimate \u03bdmax = 64 \u00b1 16 \u03bcHz for HD 181068 A,\nwhile the expected amplitude is about 80 ppm.\nFor comparison, Fig. S5c shows the amplitude spectrum of a typical red giant with \u03bdmax \u223c\n80 \u03bcHz (KIC 12507577). To make the comparison exact, we calculated this amplitude spectrum\nusing exactly the same portions of the light curve that were used for HD 181068 in Fig. S5a.\nIn KIC 12507577 we see the regular peaks that characterize solar-like oscillations, whereas in\nHD 181068 A we see just a few peaks whose removal (Fig. S5b) leaves only a slowly rising\npower distribution. The observed signal in HD 181068 A is clearly not compatible with solarlike oscillations. Indeed, the solar-like oscillations that we would expect to see in a giant of this\ntype seem to have been suppressed.\nThe frequency content of the light curve suggests an intimate link to the orbital frequencies\nin the triple system. We are led to suggest that we are seeing tidally-induced oscillations that\nare driven by the orbital motion of the BC pair. Tidally-induced oscillations have previously\nbeen reported in a few binary systems (S19, S20, S21), but here the situation is different because the period of the oscillations does not correspond to the orbit of the A component, but\nrather to that of the BC pair. While a fuller discussion of this possibility is postponed to a\nfuture publication, we note that the amplitude of tidally driven oscillations can be simply estimated by assuming that the brightness changes are proportional to the tidal heights given by\nRA ((MB + MC )/MA ) (RA /a)3 , where a is the semimajor axis of the outer binary. Every num-\n\n19\n\n\fber put together yield an estimated amplitude of 3 ppt, which is a factor of 10 larger than what\nwe observe and a factor of 40 larger than the amplitude of solar-like oscillations.\n\nC Supplemented data files\nIn addition to this document describing the supporting extra material, we also make all the data\nmentioned throughout the paper and SOM available to the general community at the webpage\nof the journal.
