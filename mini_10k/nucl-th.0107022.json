One\nwould naturally expect that the continuum should be taken\ninto account explicitly in the description of their excited\nstates. Bound (L2 ) representation, which is a popular prescription to construct spatially localized states, may give the\ngross properties of these states embedded in the continuum.\nHowever, the bound representation is incapable of describing\nquantities such as escape width and continuum spectra. The\ninclusion of the single-particle continuum for particle-hole (ph) excitations has been achieved by using the so-called continuum random-phase approximation (RPA).1) The continuum\nRPA combined with the Skyrme Hartree-Fock (HF) theory\nhas been extensively utilized to study giant resonances (GRs)\nin spherical nuclei2,3) . Photoabsorption in rare gases was also\nstudied by using the time-dependent local density approximation (LDA).4,5) One drawback of the method is that its\napplicability is limited only to systems with spherical symmetry. In this paper, we would like to present a prescription to\ntreat the full three-dimensional (3D) continuum in the RPA\nlevel.\n\nOur method is based on the modified Sternheimer method.9)\nIt recasts the linear response problem into solving the static\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type equation with a source term. The problem\nis then to solve the equation with an appropriate outgoing\nboundary condition. Our recipe here is to solve iteratively\nthe equation taking into account the boundary condition employing a Green's function of a spherical potential, separating the self-consistent potential into long-range spherical and\nshort-range non-spherical parts. This is reviewed in the next\nsection.\n\nFor finite electron systems such as molecules, theoretical analysis of photoabsorption spectra above the first ionization\nthreshold requires continuum electronic wave function in a\nnon-spherical multicenter potential. Advances in measurements with synchrotron radiation and high-resolution electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy have enabled us to obtain oscillator\nstrength distribution of an entire spectral region originated\nfrom valence electrons.6) The photon energy dependences of\nmolecular photoelectron spectra have also been measured.\nThe spreading width is less important in molecules than nuclear GR cases; however, there is a small width associated\nwith molecular vibrations and dissociations.\nSince the Hamiltonian in the Skyrme HF theory for nuclei\nand the one in the Kohn-Sham (KS) theory of the LDA for\nelectron systems are almost diagonal in coordinate representation, a grid representation in the coordinate space provides\nan economical description. A uniform grid representation in\nthe 3D Cartesian coordinate is becoming a standard method\nfor calculation of the ground state.7,8) We would like to use\nthe same 3D basis for calculation of the continuum response.\nThe main problem lies in how to incorporate the scattering\n\nLinear response in the continuum of 3D real space\nExact treatment of the continuum is possible with the use\nof a Green's function with an outgoing boundary condition.\nFor spherical systems, the Green's function can easily be constructed by making a multipole expansion and discretizing\nthe radial coordinate. This is an essential part of the continuum RPA method. In this section we present a method to\nconstruct a Green's function in the 3D grid representation for\na system without any spatial symmetry.\nThe linear response theory is formulated most conveniently\nusing a retarded density-density correlation function.10)\n\n\u03a0(r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ni\u03a0(r, t; r\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\n=\n\n\u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )h0|[\u03c1\u0302(r, t), \u03c1\u0302(r\u2032 , t\u2032 )]|0i.\n\ndtei\u03c9t\u2212\u03b7t \u03a0(r, t; r\u2032 , 0),\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThe RPA transition density in response to an external field\nVext can be expressed as\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(r, \u03c9)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd3 r\u03a0rpa (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9)Vext (r, \u03c9)\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd3 r \u2032 \u03a00 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03c9)Vscf (r\u2032 , \u03c9),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the \u03a00 is the independent-particle density-density correlation function which is defined by identifying the state |0i\n1\n\n\fin Eq.

(7), we need to calculate both occupied and\nunoccupied orbitals including the continuum wave functions\nwith positive energies. This would be a difficult task. The\ntrick of the continuum RPA is an explicit construction of the\nGreen's function in the coordinate space. If the potential V (r)\nhas spherical symmetry, G(+) (r, r\u2032 ; E) can be reduced into the\n(+)\nradial function gl (r, r \u2032 ; E).

For instance, V0 (r) is taken\nas a Coulomb potential induced by a spherical charge distribution. A necessary condition is that v must vanish outside\nthe box (model space).

Unfortunately, this explicit construction of the\nGreen's function is possible only for a one-dimensional case.\nIt is difficult to impose the boundary condition for a case of\na deformed potential. Furthermore, for 3D cases, the number of spatial grid points is too large to construct the Green's\nfunction (Ngrid \u00d7 Ngrid matrix).\n\n\u03b4\u03c1(\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c8i (r; E, Vscf ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03c10\n\nwhere V [\u03c1(r)] is a single-particle potential of either the HF or\nthe KS equation.

The\nself-consistent HF potential is calculated in the spherical box\nof radius R = 8 fm for the 16 O nucleus.

This size of matrices can be easily handled\nand the matrix inversion in Eq. (22) can be done. However, for 3D calculations in the following sections, since the\nsize of the matrix becomes of order 10 000, we shall use the\nSternheimer method with the outgoing boundary condition\ndescribed in the previous section. The strength function is\ncalculated with Eq. (20).\nIn order to see the effects of the continuum, we calculate the\n\"discrete\" RPA response as well. This can be done by simply\n(0)\n(0)\nusing a standing-wave solution wl (r) (wl (R) = 0) in Eq.\n(+)\n(9) instead of the outgoing solution wl (r). Alternatively,\nwe may solve the modified Sternheimer equation (12) with a\nboundary condition \u03c8i = 0 for r > R.\nCalculated strength functions for isoscalar giant monopole\nresonance (ISGMR) are shown in Fig. 1. The external field\nis Vext = r 2 in this calculation. For discrete RPA calculation,\nsince all excited states are discrete, we use complex energies\nE = E \u2212 i\u0393 to produce a continuous profile of the strength\nfunctions. As we see in the figure, the continuum response\nis significantly different from the smoothed discrete response.\nIn the discrete calculation, there are peaks characterized by\nthe size of the box. In Fig. 1, concentrated strengths appearing around 40 MeV are spurious peaks produced by the finite\nbox. The positions of these spurious peaks will change as the\nsize of the box is modified. In the continuum calculation, a\ndip emerges at the threshold energy of the 0s orbital (28.4\neV) but there is only a smooth tail beyond 30 MeV.\n\nInelastic electron scattering from\n\n12\n\nC\n\nIn this section, we discuss a 3D calculation of the continuum\nresponse. As we have mentioned above, although the continuum RPA has an ability to treat the single-particle continuum\nexactly, it has never been applied to deformed nuclei because\nof the difficulty of constructing the Green's function. There3\n\n\fUtilizing the Born approximation, the cross section of the\ninelastic electron scattering for momentum transfer q and energy loss E is approximated by a product of the strength\nfunction and the Mott cross section.10)\n\n0.5\n(a)\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nm\n\nf\nq=4\n\n\u22121\n\nq=0.4 fm\n0\n\nS(E, q),\n\n0.5\n\n(23)\n\nMott\n\n10\n(b)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\niqx\n\nResponse to e\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere S(E, q) is defined by Eqs.

We show results\nfor two cases that the q is parallel and perpendicular to the\nsymmetry axis (z-axis) of the nucleus. Of course, in experiments, the response averaged over different angles is observed.\n\n20\n\n\u03c0 S(E) [ MeV ]\n\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3\n=\nd\u03a9\nd\u03a9\n\niqz\n\nResponse to e\n\n\u03c0 S(E) [ MeV ]\n\nfore, the continuum effect on deformed nuclei has rarely been\ninvestigated so far. We use the same BKN interaction as in\nthe previous section and try the first calculation for a light\nnucleus 12 C. The model space is a 3D spherical box of radius\nR = 8 fm with square meshes of \u2206x = \u2206y = \u2206z = 1 fm. The\nobtained HF ground state has an oblate shape in which the\naxis ratio is approximately three to two.\n\n\u22121\n\nq=4 fm\n\u22121\n\nq=0.4 fm\nIn Fig. 2, the strengths as functions of energy are displayed\nfor low momentum transfer (q = 0.4 fm\u22121 ) and for high momentum transfer (q = 4 fm\u22121 ). It seems that peaks related\nto giant resonances can be seen up to 25 MeV. For the case of\nhigh momentum transfer, the response strongly depends on\nthe direction of q relative to the intrinsic orientation.\n\nPhotoabsorption of molecules\nFirst we discuss valence-shell photoabsorption of acetylene\nand ethylene molecules. The KS Hamiltonian for valence electrons is\n\nhks = \u2212\n\n1 2\n\u2207 + Vion + e2\n2m\n\nZ\n\nd3 r \u2032\n\n\u03c1(r\u2032 )\n+ \u03bcxc [\u03c1(r)],(24)\n|r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\nwhere Vion is an electron-ion potential for which we employ a norm-conserving pseudopotential12) with a separable\napproximation.13) The \u03bcxc is an exchange-correlation potential.\nIt is well known that the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) does not coincide with the first ionization potential in the simplest local-density approximation.\nThis fact causes a serious problem for the continuum response\ncalculation that the ionization threshold cannot be adequately\ndescribed by the static KS Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the\nexcited states around the ionization threshold appear in too\nlow excitation energies. To remedy this defect, a gradient correction for the exchange-correlation potential has been proposed. We utilize the one constructed by van Leeuwen and\nBaerends14) which we denote as \u03bc(LB) . It is so constructed\nthat the potential has a correct \u2212e2 /r tail asymptotically.\nThe energy of the highest occupied orbital also approximately\n\u22171\n\n4\n\nBecause of the assumption of the BKN interaction, the\nisoscalar response is shown in Fig. 2, with Vext = eiq*r .\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\nE [ MeV ]\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFig. 2.\nResponse of 12 C to an electromagnetic probe.

(b) The q is perpendicular to\nthe symmetry axis.\n\ncoincides with the ionization potential. For small molecules,\nTDLDA calculations with this gradient correction have shown\nto give an accurate description of discrete excitations in small\nmolecules.15)\nIn the following sections, we employ a sum of the exchangecorrelation potentials of \u03bc(PZ) of Ref. 16) for the local-density\npart and \u03bc(LB) for the gradient correction. We should remark\nhere that an accurate calculation of the gradient correction\n\u03bc(LB) (r) becomes difficult at far outside the molecule, because\n\u03bc(LB) depends on |\u2207n(r)|/n(r)4/3 which approaches a finite\nvalue but both the numerator and the denominator approach\nzero at r \u2192 \u221e. Thus, we use an explicit asymptotic form,\n\u03bc(LB) (r) = \u2212e2 /r for r > Rc . In the following, Rc is chosen\nas 5.5 \u00c5. The spherical box is taken as radius R = 6 \u00c5 with\nmeshes of \u2206x = \u2206y = \u2206z = 0.3 \u00c5.\nThe acetylene molecule, C2 H2 , has a symmetry configuration\nof D\u221eh . This high symmetry has enabled calculation of the\nGreen's function using a single-center expansion.17) Even so,\nonly two kinds of molecular orbitals, 3\u03c3g and 1\u03c0u , which are\nprimarily derived from atomic p states, have been taken into\naccount in Ref. 17), because it was difficult to describe the\ns-derived states in the single-center formulation. Since our\nframework is free from this problem, we consider all valence\norbitals, including the 2\u03c3g and 2\u03c3u in addition to the above\np-derived orbitals, to calculate the photoresponses.\n\n\fThe calculated photoabsorption oscillator strengths are shown\nin Fig. 4. The agreement with an experiment19,21) is excellent. Almost all the main features of photoabsorption spectra\nare reproduced in the calculation. The observed bound excited states show different photoresponses according to the\ndirection of the dipole field. The lowest peak at \u03c9 = 7.6 eV\nis mainly a response to a dipole field parallel to the molecular (C\u2212C) axis. This is associated with the excitations of the\nHOMO 1b3u electrons. On the other hand, states at 9.8 eV respond almost equally to a dipole field of x, y, and z directions,\nto which both 1b3g and 1b3u occupied orbitals contribute. A\nsmall peak at \u03c9 = 11.4 eV is calculated as a resonance of\n3ag orbital, which may correspond to a small shoulder in the\nexperiment. Beyond 11.7 eV, the HOMO electrons are in the\ncontinuum. The first prominent peak at 12.4 eV is a resonance with respect to a dipole field of y direction which is\nin the molecular plane and perpendicular to the C\u2212C bond.\nThe excitations of 1b2u and 1b3g electrons are the main components of this resonance. In the region of 13.2 < \u03c9 < 20\neV, 1b3g electrons can be excited into the continuum and produce the smooth background of oscillator strengths (0.1 \u223c 0.2\neV\u22121 ). The peak structure at 14.6 eV is produced by the excitation of 1b2u electrons. The peak at 16.4 eV is constructed\nby excitations from the 2b1u occupied orbitals, while the experiment indicates the resonance at 17.1 eV.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, we show about 75 % of the Thomas-ReicheKuhn (TRK) sum rule for valence electrons. In other words,\none-fourth of the TRK sum rule value lies in an energy range\nof over 40 eV.\n\nAcetylene\nocc\ncal\nstate\n(2\u03c3g )2 \u221222.4\n(2\u03c3u )2 \u221218.4\n(3\u03c3g )2 \u221216.7\n(1\u03c0u )4 \u221212.1\n\nexp\nIP\n23.5\n18.4\n16.4\n11.4\n\nocc\nstate\n(2ag )2\n(2b1u )2\n(1b2u )2\n(3ag )2\n(1b3g )2\n(1b3u )2\n\nEthylene\ncal\n\u221222.8\n\u221218.6\n\u221216.3\n\u221214.7\n\u221213.2\n\u221211.7\n\nexp\nIP\n23.7\n19.4\n16.3\n14.9\n13.0\n11.0\n\n1\nPhotoabsorption oscillator strength\n\nC2H2\n\nIPA\nRPA\n(e,e) exp\nphoton exp\n\n\u22121\n\nAnother example we show here is ethylene, C2 H4 . Ethylene is the simplest organic \u03c0-system, possessing the D2h\nsymmetry. Its two carbon atoms lie on the x-axis at\nx = \u00b10.6695 \u00c5 and its four hydrogen atoms lie in the\nx \u2212 y plane at (x, y) = (1.2342, 0.9288), (1.2342, \u22120.9288),\n(\u22121.2342, 0.9288), (\u22121.2342, \u22120.9288) in units of \u00c5.

There are ten valence electrons\nand the calculated energies of occupied orbitals are listed in\nTable 1. We obtain the photoabsorption oscillator strengths\nas a function of photon energy, as shown in Fig. 3. The calculation indicates a sharp bound resonance at \u03c9 = 9.6 eV\nand a broad structure around 15 eV which seems to be a\nsuperposition of three resonances. The resonance at 9.6 eV\nstrongly responds to a dipole field parallel to the molecular\naxis. The large oscillator strengths in the IPA at \u03c9 = 5 \u223c 8\neV and at \u03c9 = 12.5 \u223c 13.5 eV are shifted to higher energies by the dielectric correlation. The agreement with the\nexperimental data is significantly improved by the inclusion\nof the dynamical induced field (screening). The static dipole\npolarizability is also affected significantly: In the IPA calculation, the polarizabilities parallel (\u03b1k ) and perpendicular (\u03b1\u22a5 )\nto the molecular axis are \u03b1k = 10.7 \u00c53 and \u03b1\u22a5 = 3.87 \u00c53 .\nThe dynamical screening reduces these values to 4.79 \u00c53 and\n2.77 \u00c53 , respectively, which well agree with the experimental\nvalues, \u03b1k = 4.73 and \u03b1\u22a5 = 2.87 \u00c53 .18)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nPhoton energy \u03c9 [ eV ]\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFig. 3.\nCalculated and experimental photoabsorption oscillator\nstrengths of acetylene.

The\nmethod allows us to treat the escaping width and the dynamical correlation effects self-consistently. We have shown\nthe ISGMR in the continuum for 16 O and compared the results of the continuum and discrete calculations. The continuum response cannot be reproduced by simply smoothing\nthe discrete strengths. Perhaps, this is because the continuum level density is not properly taken into account in the\ndiscrete calculation. Then, we have shown a calculation of\nelectromagnetic response function for a nucleus 12 C and photoabsorption spectra for molecules, acetylene and ethylene.\nThe main difficulty is the heavy computational task, especially for calculations of response near the threshold energies.\nUsing a single CPU of a Fujitsu VPP700E supercomputer at\nRIKEN, the numerical calculation of photoabsorption spectra\nof ethylene in Fig. 4 takes about 30 minutes at a single photon\nenergy \u03c9. Since we need to calculate the response to dipole\nfield of the x, y, and z directions, it takes about 1.5 hours to\n5\n\n\f18) N. J. Bridge and A. D. Buchkingham, Proc. R. Soc.
