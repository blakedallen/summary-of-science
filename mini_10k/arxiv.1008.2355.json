Reheating occurs through the decays\nof heavy Majorana neutrinos which are produced during preheating and in decays of\nthe Higgs particles of B\u2212L breaking. Baryogenesis is an interplay of nonthermal and\nthermal leptogenesis, accompanied by thermally produced gravitino dark matter.\nThe proposed mechanism simultaneously explains the generation of matter and dark\nmatter, thereby relating the absolute neutrino mass scale to the gravitino mass.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThermal leptogenesis [1] explains the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe in terms of neutrino masses that are consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments.\nIn its simplest version, the primordial lepton asymmetry is generated by the CP violating\ninteractions of N1 , the lightest of the heavy Majorana neutrinos, the seesaw partners of the\nordinary neutrinos. Typical values for the N1 mass and for the leptogenesis temperature\nare M1 \u223c TL \u223c 1010 GeV [2].\nIn supersymmetric theories such high reheating temperatures cause the 'gravitino\nproblem' for heavy unstable gravitinos [3,4,5]. However, if the gravitino is the lightest superparticle (LSP), this problem can become a virtue since for typical leptogenesis\ntemperatures and for superparticle masses of the electroweak scale, thermal production of\ngravitinos can explain the observed amount of dark matter [6]. The dominant contribution\nfrom QCD processes is given by\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n100 GeV \u0010 mg\u0303 \u00112\nTR\n2\n\u03a9G\u0303 h = C\n,\n(1)\n1010 GeV\nmG\u0303\n1 TeV\nwhere TR is the reheating temperature while mG\u0303 and mg\u0303 are gravitino and gluino masses,\nrespectively; the coefficient C = 0.27 to leading order in the gauge coupling [7,8].1 Hence,\nfor TR \u223c TL and superparticle masses characteristic of gravity or gaugino mediation one\nindeed obtains the observed amount of dark matter, \u03a9DM h2 \u2243 0.11 [10].\nThermal leptogenesis is consistent with a reheating temperature TR much larger than\nTL , which is not the case for thermally produced gravitino dark matter. Consistency of\nthese two mechanisms for the origin of matter and dark matter then requires an explanation of why TL and TR have the same order of magnitude.\nSuccessful leptogenesis, independent of initial conditions, favours the mass window\n\u22123\n10 eV <\n\u223c mi <\n\u223c 0.1 eV [11] for the light neutrino masses . For an effective neutrino mass\n\u2020\nm\ne 1 = (mD mD )11 /M1 \u223c 0.01 eV, where mD is the Dirac neutrino mass, the decay width\nof the heavy Majorana neutrino N1 becomes\n\u0012\n\u00132\nm\ne 1 M1\n0\n\u223c 103 GeV ,\n(2)\n\u0393 N1 =\n8\u03c0 vEW\nwhere we have used vEW = 174 GeV for the vacuum expectation value of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. If the hot phase of the early universe is initiated by the decays of\n1\n\nNote that C has an O(1) uncertainty due to unknown higher order contributions and nonperturbative\neffects [7]. Resummation of thermal masses increases C by about a factor of two [9].\n\n2\n\n\fparticles with decay width \u0393, the reheating temperature is given by\n\u00131/4 p\n\u0012\n90\nTR =\n\u0393MP ,\n8\u03c0 3 g\u2217\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g\u2217 \u223c 200 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and MP =\n1.22\u00d71019 GeV is the Planck mass. If reheating occurs through the decay of N1 neutrinos,\none obtains\nq\nTR \u223c 0.2 * \u03930N1 MP \u223c 1010 GeV ,\n(4)\nwhich is indeed the temperature needed for thermal leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter.\nThis observation raises the question whether in the thermal bath produced by heavy\nMajorana neutrino decays both, the matter-antimatter asymmetry and gravitino dark\nmatter, can be simultaneously produced. In the following we shall present an example\nwhich demonstrates that this is indeed possible.\n\n2\n\nFlavour model and tachyonic preheating\n\nIn supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model the superpotential for matter fields\nincluding right-handed neutrinos reads\nWM = huij 10i 10j Hu + hdij 5\u2217i 10j Hd + h\u03bdij 5\u2217i ncj Hu + hni nci nci S ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we have used SU(5) notation for ordinary quarks and leptons, i = 1, 2, 3 counts the\ngenerations and nc denote the charge conjugate of right-handed neutrinos; Hu , Hd and S\nare the electroweak and B \u2212 L symmetry breaking fields, respectively,\nhHu i = vu ,\n\nhHd i = vd ,\n\nhSi = vB\u2212L .\n\n(6)\n\nThe heavy Majorana neutrinos are given by Ni = ni + nci .\nFor the Yukawa couplings we shall use a representative model [12] with a FroggattNielsen U(1) flavour symmetry, which is consistent with the observed hierarchical quark\nand lepton masses, thermal leptogenesis [12] as well as constraints from flavour changing\nprocesses [13]. Their order of magnitude is given by\nhij \u221d \u03b7 Qi +Qj ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the chiral U(1) charges are listed in Table 1; the parameter \u03b7 \u2243 1/ 300 is determined by the hierarchy of quark and lepton masses.\n3\n\n\f\u03c8i\nQi\n\n103\n0\n\n102\n1\n\n101\n2\n\n5\u22173\n1\n\n5\u22172\n1\n\n5\u22171\n2\n\nnc3\n0\n\nnc2\n0\n\nnc1\n1\n\nHu\n0\n\nHd\n0\n\nS\n0\n\nTable 1: Chiral U (1) charges. 10 = (q, uc , ec ), 5\u2217 = (dc , l).\n\n\u221a\nUsing the seesaw mass relation and the estimate m\u03bd = m3 m2 \u223c 0.01 eV, successful\nthermal leptogenesis determines the mass of the lightest heavy Majorana neutrino, M1 =\n1010 GeV [12]. From\nM1 = hn1 vB\u2212L \u2243 \u03b7 2 vB\u2212L\n\n(8)\n\none then obtains vB\u2212L \u2243 3 \u00d7 1012 GeV.

Since this ratio will be important in the\nfollowing phenomenological analysis, we shall parametrize this uncertainty explicitly by\nthe effective neutrino mass m\ne 1 introduced in Eq. (2).\nA crucial ingredient of leptogenesis are the CP asymmetries in heavy Majorana neutrinos decays [15,16],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n\u0002 \u03bd\u2020 \u03bd 2 \u0003\nMj\n1\n1\nIm (h h )ij F\n,\n(15)\n\u01ebi =\n8\u03c0 (h\u03bd\u2020 h\u03bd )ii j6=i\nMi\nfrom which we obtain\n\u01eb1 \u223c 0.1 \u03b7 4 \u223c 10\u22126 ,\n\n\u01eb2,3 \u2243 0.1 \u03b7 2 \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(16)\n\nThese asymmetries determine the lepton asymmetry which is generated by decays and\ninverse decays of the heavy neutrinos. Note that for M1 \u2243 1010 GeV, the estimate\n\u01eb1 \u223c 10\u22126 corresponds to the maximal possible CP asymmetry [17]. For smaller heavy\nneutrino masses the asymmetry is reduced by the mass ratio, \u01eb1 \u223c 10\u22126 M1 /1010 GeV.\nThe vacuum energy of a phase with unbroken B \u2212 L symmetry can drive a period of\ninflation, which then rapidly ends due to the spinodal growth of long wave-length modes,\na process known as 'tachyonic preheating' [18]. The true vacuum is reached at a time tPH\nafter inflation [19],\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n32\u03c0 2\n2\n\u2020\ntPH \u2243\nln\n.\n(17)\nhS Si t=t = vB\u2212L ,\nPH\n2mS\n\u03bb\nDuring this phase transition the energy of the false vacuum is converted mostly into a\nnonrelativistic gas of S bosons, with an admixture of heavy neutrinos3 whose contribution\nto the energy density is determined by their coupling to the Higgs field [19],\n\u03c1Ni\n\u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 gN \u03bbf (\u03b1i , 0.8) ;\n(18)\n\u03c10\np\n\u221a\nhere gN = 2 and f (\u03b1, \u03b3) = \u03b12 + \u03b3 2 \u2212 \u03b3 with \u03b1i = hni / \u03bb.

First, the dominant contribution to the energy density is the nonrelativistic\ngas of S bosons (cf. Eq.

It is convenient to introduce the comoving number densities for all particle\nspecies X,\nNX (t) = a3 (t)nX (t) .\n\n(21)\n\nAt t \u223c t2 = 1/\u03930N2,3 the heavy neutrinos N2 and N3 decay, producing the initial\nradiation density4\n\u03c1R (t2 ) =\n\n2rN2 \u03c10\n,\na3 (t2 )\n\n(22)\n\nwith temperature\nT (t2 ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n30 2rN2 \u03c10\n\u03c0 2 g\u2217 a3 (t2 )\n\n\u00131/4\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nThe out-of-equilibrium decay of N2 and N3 also produces a B \u2212 L asymmetry5 .

In\nthe following we describe the solution for a representative choice of neutrino masses, CP\nasymmetries6 and superparticle masses: m\ne 1 = 10\u22123 eV, M1 = 1010 GeV, \u01eb1 = 10\u22126,\n\u01eb2,3 = \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and mG\u0303 = 100 GeV, mg\u0303 = 800 GeV. Technical details of the solution\nand a systematic study of the parameter space compatible with leptogenesis and gravitino\ndark matter will be presented in a forthcoming publication [14].\nThe various components of the energy density and the comoving number densities are\ncompared as functions of the scale factor a in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Immediately\nafter the end of tachyonic preheating the decay of N2 and N3 generates radiation, an initial\nB \u2212 L asymmetry and subsequently a thermal abundance of N1 neutrinos. At a \u223c 2, the\nS bosons decay. The produced N1 neutrinos are relativistic, but nonthermal. At a \u223c 150,\nthe thermal N1 neutrinos reach thermal equilibrium, the initial B\u2212L asymmetry is washed\nout, a new B \u2212 L asymmetry and the dominant part of radiation are produced in decays\nof the nonthermal N1S neutrinos. Furthermore, gravitinos are continuously produced from\nthe thermal bath. Around a \u223c 1000 the final B \u2212 L asymmetry and the gravitino number\ndensity are reached.\nThe present value of baryon asymmetry is obtained from\n\u03b7B =\n\ng\u22170 NB\u2212L\nn0B\n=\nc\nsph\nn0\u03b3\ng\u2217 N\u03b3\n\naf\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere af \u223c 104 is a scale factor after leptogenesis is completed; in the supersymmetric\nStandard Model the sphaleron conversion factor csph = 8/23, the effective numbers of\ndegrees of freedom at high and low temperatures are g\u2217 = 915/4 and g\u22170 = 43/11, respectively, and the number density of photons is N\u03b3 = a3 g\u03b3 \u03b6(3)/\u03c0 2 T 3 .

The calculated baryon\nasymmetry is about two orders of magnitude larger than the observed one, \u03b7BCMB \u2243\n6.2 \u00d7 10\u221210 [10], which is consistent since we have used the maximal CP asymmetry.\nThe temperature of radiation is shown in Fig. 3 as function of the scale factor. It\ndecreases like T \u221d 1/a except for an approximate plateau around TL \u2243 5 \u00d7 109 GeV\nat a \u223c 100, when the N1 neutrinos decay. Note that the temperature TL agrees with\nthe reheating temperature TR estimated in Eq. (4) up to a factor of two. Inserting\nthe temperature TL in the estimate Eq. (1) for the gravitino abundance, one obtains\nagreement with the result of the full calculation given in Eq. (42). For such large reheating\ntemperatures nonthermal production of gravitinos is usually negligible [21].\nIt is instructive to compare the calculated baryon asymmetry with two extreme cases,\nnamely thermal leptogenesis and the rapid conversion of a gas of nonrelativistic N1 neutrinos dominating the energy density of the universe. For thermal leptogenesis one obtains\nfor our choice of parameters (cf. [11])\n\u03b7Bthermal =\n\n3 g\u22170\ncsph \u01eb1 \u03baf (m\ne 1 ) \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 ,\n4 g\u2217\n\n(43)\n\nwhere we have used csph = 8/23 and \u03baf (10\u22123 eV) \u2243 0.1 for the efficiency factor. In the\ncase of rapid conversion, energy conservation yields (cf. [22])\nTL\n3\n\u2243 9 \u00d7 10\u22127 ,\n\u03b7Brapid \u2243 7 csph \u01eb1\n4\nM1\n11\n\n(44)\n\n\fwhich is closer to the result of our calculation Eq. (42). Varying the parameters m\ne1\nand M1 one can interpolate between thermal and nonthermal leptogenesis. The effective\nneutrino mass m\ne 1 is closely related to the smallest neutrino mass m1 and therefore to the\nabsolute neutrino mass scale. Via its effect on the reheating temperature and gravitino\ndark matter, the absolute neutrino mass scale is thus related to the gravitino mass.\nThe case of rapid conversion is also realized in leptogenesis from inflaton decays [23].\nHere the reheating temperature is determined by the decay width of the inflaton. One\ncan then have TR \u226a M1 and in this way avoid overproduction of gravitinos. For larger\ninflaton decay widths reheating temperatures TR \u223c M1 can be reached, associated with\nlarger baryon asymmetries [24], similar to the situation described in this paper.\nWe have shown that reheating the universe by heavy Majorana neutrino decays can\nsimultaneously explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry and the observed dark matter\nabundance in terms of thermally produced gravitinos. Starting from an initial state of\nunbroken B \u2212 L symmetry, tachyonic preheating leads to an interplay of nonthermal\nand thermal leptogenesis, which is controlled by the heavy neutrino decay widths. Open\nquestions concern the connection with models of inflation and tachyonic preheating in\nsupersymmetric theories.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Fukugita and T. Yanagida, Phys. Lett.
