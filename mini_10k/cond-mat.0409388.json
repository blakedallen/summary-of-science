The latter embeds larger and\nlarger fragments of the solid with shells of the same atoms\nand the same geometrical parameters, but describes them\nwith a smaller basis. Thus the contribution of the metallic binding is calculated at a self-consistent field level in\nthe infinite solid, while the correlation part, which is\nfairly local, is treated in finite embedded clusters with\nwavefunction based correlation methods.\nThe Hartree-Fock calculation is performed with the\nprogram package Crystal98 [10]. To deal with the\nscalar-relativistic effects, we apply a small-core scalarrelativistic pseudopotential [12] where the 5s2 p6 d10 6s2\nelectrons are treated explicitly. As basis set for Crystal98 we modify the valence-double-zeta (vdz, i.e. providing 2 atomic orbitals for each occupied crystal orbital)\ncorrelation-consistent basis set of Peterson [13] resulting\nin (6s6p6d)/[4s4p3d]. We frequently compare with results of a calculation with a non-relativistic small-core\npseudopotential [12].\nA first important observation is that mercury is not\nbound at the HF level (see Table II), both in the relativistic and the non-relativistic case. We checked that\nthe system is unbound within the HF approximation for\na wide range of lattice constants. Thus, the binding is\nentirely due to correlations. The cohesive energy at the\nHF level is less repulsive in the non-relativistic treatment.\nThis is due to the smaller atomic sp splitting in the latter case. The p orbitals are too low in energy and their\ncontribution to binding is overestimated.\nThe relativistic HF band structure (see Fig.1) and the\ndensity of states near the Fermi level are quite similar\nto the one obtained with LDA [5,14]. Between the L\nand Z points a conduction band crosses the Fermi level,\nresponsible for the metallic behaviour. The logarithmic\nsingularity which occurs with the HF approximation at\nthe Fermi level is not discernible for the k-mesh used.\nThe 5d bands are quite flat and placed well below the\nFermi level. They overlap strongly with the 6s band at\nthe \u0393 point, indicating the importance of the core-valence\ncorrelations. The strong sp mixing can be seen in the ldecomposed density of states. Near the Fermi level, both\nhave nearly the same magnitude. A Mulliken population\nanalysis for the solid yields an electron transfer of 0.73 e\nfrom the s shell to the p shell, compared to 1.03 e in the\nnonrelativistic case. The non-relativistic HF band structure (dashed lines in Fig.1) shows a smaller sp-splitting at\n\nSolid mercury in the rhombohedral structure is unbound\nwithin the self-consistent field (Hartree-Fock) approximation.\nThe metallic binding is entirely due to electronic correlations.\nWe determine the cohesive energy of solid mercury within\nan ab-initio many-body expansion for the correlation part.\nElectronic correlations in the 5d shell contribute about half\nto the cohesive energy. Relativistic effects are found to be\nvery important. Very good agreement with the experimental\nvalue is obtained.\n\nPacs-No.: 71.15.-m, 71.20.-b, 96.30.Dz\n\nMercury is a very special metal: It is a liquid at room\ntemperature and it freezes at T = 233K with a rhombohedral lattice (a0 = 3.005\u00c5, \u03b1 = 70.53o [1]). The\nmercury dimer is a van der Waals bound molecule with\na binding energy of about 0.05 eV [2], more than one\nmagnitude lower than the bulk cohesive energy of 0.79\neV per atom [1]. Increasing the size of mercury clusters,\nthe character of binding changes from van der Waals over\ncovalent (around 20 atoms) to metallic (more than 100\natoms) [3].\nThe origin of the cohesion in the solid mercury metal\nis the topic of this letter. A mean-field Hartree-Fock\ntreatment yields no binding: In contrast to the textbook\nknowledge of the metallic bond, the cohesion of mercury\nis entirely due to correlations. No surprise, the cohesive energy and the lattice constants of bulk mercury\nhave been a long outstanding problem in computational\nphysics [4\u20136]. Questions of particular interest are the influence of the d-shell correlation on the binding and the\nimportance of relativistic effects. For the dimer, the dshell correlation contributes with more than a factor of\n2 to the dissociation energy [7,8]. Wavefunction-based\nmethods with very large basis sets achieve good agreement with experiment. For the metallic solid, one could\nexpect DFT calculations to give reasonable results, but\ndifferent functionals yield quite different values of the cohesive energy [6]. As dimer or trimer can be handled\nwith wavefunction-based methods, it seems natural to\nemploy a many-body expansion for the cohesive properties of larger clusters or the solid. However, a straightforward many-body expansion with 2-body and 3-body\nforces taken from free clusters works properly for rare gas\ncrystals [9] but fails for metallic mercury [6].\nWe propose a combined approach: The self-consistent\nfield treatment is performed at the Hartree-Fock (HF)\n\n1\n\n\f\u0393 than the relativistic calculation. In a two-band model,\none expects therefore the hybridization gaps, e.g., at the\nL or F point, to be larger and the p character of the\nvalence band to be stronger, as it is seen in the bulk calculation (Fig.1).\nWe now proceed to the correlation treatment with the\nincremental scheme [11]. The correlation energy of the\nsolid is expanded in 1-body increments \u01ebi , 2-body increments \u2206\u01ebij and so on:\nX\nX\nX\n\u2206\u01ebij +\n\u2206\u01ebijk + . . . . (1)\n\u01ebi +\nEcorr =\ni\n\ni<j\n\n1-body increment \u01ebi .\nThe cohesive part of the 1-body increment\n\u2206\u01ebcoh\n= \u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebcorr\ni\natom .\n\n(2)\n\nis defined as the change of the correlation energy of\nthe atom due to surrounding it with other atoms. The\ncorrelation energy of the free atom \u01ebcorr\natom is calculated\nwith the same basis set as used in the finite cluster (basis functions on the surrounding, too). We list\nthe cohesive part of the 1-body increment for different orbitals correlated and different basis sets applied\nin the first part of Table I. Basis A utilizes on Peterson's vdz basis (7s7p6d1f )/[7s6p5d1f ]. Basis B utilizes on Peterson's vtz exponents and corresponds to\n(10s9p7p2f 1g)/[8s7p6d2f 1g] and Basis C on the vqz exponents, i.e. (12s12p9d3f 2g1h)/[9s8p7d3f 2g1h]. All values of \u2206\u01ebcoh\nare repulsive. The atom in the metallic\ni\nsolid has a smaller correlation energy than the free atom,\nbecause the cage effect increases the level spacing and\ntherefore decreases the correlation energy. For a reasonable basis set, e.g. Basis B or Basis C, where the Hilbert\nspace is large enough to polarise the closed 5d10 and the\n5s2 p6 shell, the correlation of the 5d10 shell is the same\nin the free atom and in the atom in the solid, but the correlation of the underlying 5s2 p6 shell yields in the solid\na repulsive contribution of about 0.8 mH.\nNext, we consider the contributions from the 2-body increments. All pairs of atoms up to 3.0a0 are embedded\nseparately and, again, HF calculations are performed to\ngenerate the localised orbitals. The embedding part is\nkept frozen, while the orbitals of the atoms to be correlated are reoptimized with a better basis set and then\ncorrelated at the CCSD(T) level. The correlation of the\n5d10 6s2 shell yields the 2-body correlation energy \u01ebij .\nOnly the non-additive part\n\ni<j<k\n\nThe sums include groups of occupied localised orbitals.\nNote that we expand only the correlation part, in contrast to Moyano et al. [6], whose many-body expansion\ninvolves the total energy. A second difference is that we\nperform our calculations in embedded clusters to mimic\nthe confinement of the electrons in the solid; for comparison see [15].\nThe incremental scheme obtains the energy increments\nfrom finite clusters calculations. For solid mercury the\nclusters were generated as follows: The rhombohedral\nstructure can be viewed as a central atom surrounded by\natom shells of various size. There first shell contains 12\natoms, 6 of them at distance a0 and 6 at 1.15a0. We select\nthe atoms which we want to correlate and surround each\nof them with atoms of the first shell. If the atoms to be\ncorrelated are far away, we select for the embedding also\nall atoms found within a cylinder of radius 1.15a0 around\nthe connection line. The embedding atoms are described\nwith a large-core pseudopotential [16] and only with a\ns basis set (4s)/[2s] [16]. This small basis set prevents\nthe electrons to move onto the surface of the cluster, but\nstill mimics the Pauli repulsion of the neighbourhood sufficiently well. Performing a HF calculation of the cluster (the basis set for the small-core pseudopotential is\n[3s1p1d], i.e, without unoccupied p basis functions) and\nlocalising the occupied orbitals [17], yields well localised\norbitals on the individual atoms, which can be separated\nin embedding orbitals and orbitals to be correlated. With\nthis procedure, we can generate local van der Waals like\norbitals of the solid structure.\nThe delocalization of true metallic orbitals is treated via\nthe incremental scheme as follows: Any orbital group i\ncontains now all localised orbitals of atom i. In the first\nstep we enlarge the basis set of the atom to be correlated\nto a reasonable quality, recalculate the integrals and reoptimize only the orbitals of the atom to be correlated in\na HF calculation while the orbitals of the embedding are\nkept frozen. This provides us with fairly local orbitals\non the atom to be correlated. On top of this HF calculation, we perform a Coupled-Cluster calculation with Single and Double excitations and perturbative treatment of\nthe Triples (CCSD(T)) [18]. All calculation of the finite\nclusters are performed with the program package MOLPRO2002 [19]. The correlation energy provides us the\n\n\u2206\u01ebij = \u01ebij \u2212 \u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebj .\n\n(3)\n\nis required for the correlation energy of the solid (Eq.\n1). To minimize the error due to the embedding, the 1body increment which is subtracted in Eq. (3) has been\ndetermined in the same cluster with the second atom described with the small basis set. We have performed the\ncalculation of the 2-body increments with Basis B up to\na distance of 3.0a0 , where the increment is less than 10\n\u03bcH. We fit the van der Waals formula to the region from\n1.5a0 to 2.8a0 . The value C6 =297 atomic units is comparable with data from the literature [8,20,21]. Now, we\ncan estimate the cohesive energy contributions from faraway pairs. If we include explicitly increments from all\npairs smaller than 2.52a0 and estimate the rest (see Table II), the latter contribute only about 2% to the 2-body\ncohesive energy.\nTable I lists the nearest-neighbour 2-body increment for\ndifferent basis sets and different orbitals to be correlated.\nPure valence correlations contribute about 40% (Basis B)\n2\n\n\fto the two-body increment, the 5d10 shell correlations are\nsplitted in the 5d10 -valence (38%) and 5d10 -5d10 (22%)\ncorrelation (Basis B). The correlation of the 5s2 p6 shell\nincreases the magnitude of the 2-body increment by 6%.\nThe increase of the 2-body increment applying Basis C\ninstead of Basis B is about 7%. But probably still the\nbasis set limit is not reached. The dissociation energy of\nthe free Hg dimer obtained with an augmented vqz basis\nset, which is comparable to our Basis C for the solid, is\nstill 13% below the estimated basis set limit [13].\nThe next step of the many-body expansion are the 3-body\nincrements. It is well known that 3- and higher-body contributions are important for the binding in mercury [6].\nWe calculate all 3-body increments where two distances\nare \u2264 1.65a0 and the third \u2264 3.30a0 . The 3-body increment\n\nenergy of the Hg dimer show only a small influence. The\nspin-orbit coupling of the 5d shell should be not so much\ndifferent in the solid and the free atom, therefore the net\neffect on the cohesive energy should be small.\nThe latter one is due to zero-point phonon degrees of\nfreedom. An estimation of the zero-point energy can be\ndone with the Debye model EZPE = 89 kB \u0398D [23], with\nthe Debye temperature \u0398D =71.9K for mercury [24].\nWe have summarized our results in Table II. The HF\npart of the cohesive energy is repulsive, the 1-body correlation contribution to the cohesive energy is repulsive,\ntoo. The main contribution to the binding comes from\nthe 2-body increments, with about half of this originating\nfrom the core-valence correlation of the d shell. Without\ncorrelating the d shell solid mercury would not be bound.\nThe non-relativistic 2-body increments yield a significant\nover-binding. The 3-body contributions of the valence\nshell are attractive, whereas the 3-body contributions of\nthe d shell are repulsive, reducing the 3-body contributions to about 10% of the 2-body contributions. Furthermore, the non-relativistic 3-body terms are strongly\nover-binding. This is due to the enlarged valence correlations and to the fact that the non-relativistic d shell\nis not interacting with the s-band at the \u0393 point (see\nFig.1). Both lead to a too small repulsive part due to\nthe core-valence correlation. The spin-orbit contribution\nand the zero-point energy can be neglected. If we extrapolate the 2-body-contributions to Basis C and to the\ninclusion of 5s2 p6 correlation we reach 74% of the experimental cohesive energy. If we further estimate the basis\nset error to the basis set limit from the dimer data, very\ngood agreement with experiment (99%) is obtained.\nIn summary, we have presented a method, which allows\nus to determine the cohesive energy of solid mercury\nwithin the same accuracy with the experimental value as\nit was achieved for the much simpler rare gas crystals [9].\nIt can be easily systematically improved by expanding to\nhigher orders and by applying better basis sets when the\ncomputing capabilities improve. Of course, the combination of extended HF calculations and the incremental\nscheme for the correlations can be applied to other metallic systems, too. But the specific nature of the mercurymercury bond constitutes arguably the most interesting\ncase.\n\n\u2206\u01ebijk = \u01ebijk \u2212 (\u2206\u01ebij + \u2206\u01ebik + \u2206\u01ebjk ) \u2212 (\u01ebi + \u01ebj + \u01ebk ) (4)\nis only the non-additive part due to the simultaneous correlation (5d10 6s2 shell) of three atoms in the solid, and\ntherefore expected to be small in comparison with the\n2-body increment. The corresponding 2- and 1-body increments are calculated in the same embedding as the\n3-body correlation energy \u01ebijk . We apply Basis B for\nthe 3-body increments. Summing all 3-body increments\nwhere two distances are \u2264 1.15a0 yields an attractive\ncontribution to the cohesive energy of 5.1 mH, whereas\nthe rest yields only 2.4 mH. If we follow Axilrod and\nTeller [22] and fit a dipole-dipole-dipole interaction to\nthe 3-body increments where no distance is shorter than\n1.5a0 and estimate the far away triangles with this fitting\nformula, the sum over the far-away triangles contributes\nless than 0.01 mH to the cohesion. This is due to the\nrapid decay of r\u22129 and a substantial cancellation of contributions from triangles with different angles. The basis\nset dependence of the 3-body increments was tested for\nthe largest individual 3-body increment. Applying Basis\nC instead of Basis B yields an increase of 20%.\nThe 4-body contributions are calculated according to the\nscheme described for the 3-body increments. Here Basis\nA is applied. For one geometry Basis B is used, the increase of the increment is about 20%. Five connected\n4-body clusters have been selected. The largest contribution comes from the linear one. Like for the linear\n3-body increment, the presence of a highly polarisable\ncentral atom yields a significant increase of the correlation energy. But even for the large linear increments,\nthe magnitude of the 4-body increment is by a factor of\n4 smaller than the corresponding 3-body increment. In\naddition, most 4-body increments are repulsive, so we\ncan expect an alternating sign series for the correlation\nenergy of the solid.\nBesides the contributions discussed up to now there are\ntwo small contributions to the cohesive energy resulting\nfrom the spin-orbit coupling and the zero-point energy.\nFor the former, published values [7,8] for the dissociation\n\nAcknowledgement: The authors would like to thank\nHermann Stoll (Stuttgart, Germany), Peter Fulde (Dresden, Germany) and Erich Runge (Dresden, Germany)\nfor many valuable discussions and Peter Schwerdtfeger\n(Auckland, New Zealand), who first drew their attention\nto the mercury puzzle.\n\n3\n\n\f\u2206\u01ebcoh\n1\n\n\u2206\u01eb12\n\nBasis\nA\nB\nC\nA\nB\nC\n\n6s2\n+0.004287\n+0.004230\n+0.004168\n-0.003468\n-0.004107\n-0.004278\n\n5d10 6s2\n+0.004740\n+0.004260\n+0.004210\n-0.009648\n-0.009862\n-0.010550\n\n5s2 5p6 5d10 6s2\n+0.005390\n+0.005089\n+0.0049801\n-0.010291\n-0.010487\n-0.011268\n\nTABLE I.
