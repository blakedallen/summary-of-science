Some authors have proposed\nto achieve this goal using interactions between atoms and light, where a quantum state\nexchange can take place [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], leading to the preparation of a desired collective spin\nstate. A different set of proposals make use of an appropriate measurement on one of the\nfield's observables that leads to the collapse of the ensemble onto the desired entangled spin\nstate. In general, these schemes fall into two categories: conditional [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and\ndeterministic [13, 14, 15]. In a conditional entanglement generation scheme, the prepared\nstate of the atoms is conditioned by the outcome of the measurement on the field state. The\nrandom character of the state resulting from the measurement back-action can be removed\nif one performs a continuous quantum nondemolition measurement of a spin observable and\nadding a feedback loop for a posteriori quantum state correction based on the detection\noutcome. In this way a deterministic (unconditional) quantum state preparation scheme\ncan be realized, where the uncertainty in the final state is removed.\nIn general, multilevel atoms with long-lived ground substates are used, where two of the\nground sublevels form an effective two-level atom. The manipulation of the collective atomic\nspin, obtained by summation over the individual spins associated with each atom in the\nmedium, is achieved by driving ground-excited state transitions using classical or quantized\nradiation fields. As a result of the interactions, a signal field is generated that reflects some\nquantum mechanical fluctuations in the atomic ensemble; its detection can give information\nabout the atomic ensemble state. In the off-resonance regime, an effective Hamiltonian can\nbe found with a coupling between atoms and signal field that is proportional to the strength\nof the atom's coupling to the vacuum and also to the amplitude of the driving field. An\nincrease in the control field's amplitude, therefore, would seem to allow one to generate\noptimal entanglement. However, the downside of using coupling through excited levels is\nthat spontaneous emission comes into play, leading to a rapid decoherence of the system.\nIn consequence, it is necessary to limit spontaneous emission losses to a small value, which\nforces one to work in a regime of weak coupling of the atomic system to the field system to\nbe measured, and only weak entanglement can be obtained.\nThe competition between spontaneous emission and measurement strength is best illus2\n\n\ftrated in the case of spin squeezed state [16] generation. The challenge there is to reduce\nfluctuations in a spin component orthogonal to the mean spin, while keeping the average\nspin length large. The measurement strength controls the reduction of fluctuations, while\nspontaneous emission leads to a diminishing of the spin length. In a recent publication [17],\nit has been shown that, for the case of a pencil-shaped medium with Fresnel number close\nto unity, in the regime of small decay, optimal results are limited by the resonant optical\ndepth of the sample.\nDespite the interplay between measurement strength and spontaneous decay, it is possible to imagine a situation in which spontaneous decay does not limit the value of the\nmeasurement coupling strength. In one such scenario, the system is prepared in a dark state\nwhich is preserved during the interaction by a convenient choice of driving fields. This is\nthe situation presented in this paper, where a quantized signal field, generated via fourwave mixing in a double \u039b atomic system in a pencil-shaped medium, is entangled with the\ncollective atomic state. The generated signal pulse reflects fluctuations in the population\ndifference between the two ground substates. The measurement on the signal field photon\nnumber can, therefore, give information on the z component of the atomic spin, projecting\nthe system into either a spin squeezed or Schrodinger cat state. At the same time, as opposed to the situation illustrated in [17], the collective x polarized spin state in which the\nsystem is initially prepared, is very nearly a dark state for this combination of fields and\nis subject to minimal decay. No severe limitations on the measurement coupling strength\nare therefore necessary, and results similar to the ideal case presented in [17] are obtained.\nWith the assumption of perfect detection, the Heisenberg limit is the ultimate limitation to\nthe squeezing parameter.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II the proposed scheme is described and\nan analytical expression for the atomic operator giving rise to the signal field is obtained;\nspontaneous emission effects are also discussed. In Sec. III, an expression for the signal field\namplitude operator is obtained, which is shown to reflect atomic population fluctuations.\nAn effective Hamiltonian necessary for a wave function description of the problem is derived\nin Sec. IV, while in Sec. V the generation of entanglement via conditional measurement of\nthe signal field is discussed. Some conclusions are presented in Sec. VI.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nSCHEME AND METHOD\n\nA pencil-shaped atomic medium aligned along the z axis (left end situated at z = 0), with\ntransverse area A, length L, and density na is considered. The internal structure of an atom\n[Fig. 1(b)] is a double \u039b scheme with ground levels 1 and 2 and excited levels 3 and 4. Three\nclassical laser pulses having duration T \u226b L/c (where c is the speed of light), wave vectors\nk1 , k2 (pumps) and kp (probe), and frequencies \u03a91 , \u03a92 and \u03a9p are simultaneously shined on\nthe atoms. We consider an off-resonant regime with one-photon detuning \u2206 for the pump\nfields, one-photon detuning \u2206p for the probe field, and two-photon Raman detuning \u03b4 [see\nFig. 1(b)]. The three classical waves mix inside the atomic medium to generate a multitude\nof secondary waves; the one which propagates along the positive z direction [see Fig. 1(a)]\nand which can be viewed as a reflection of the first pump wave off a spatial grating produced\nby the second pump and the probe is of interest and denoted as the signal wave. This wave\nis radiated on the 2 \u2192 3 transition, and has frequency \u03a9s = \u03a9p \u2212 (\u03a91 \u2212 \u03a92 ) and phase\nmatched wave vector ks = (\u03a9s /c) zb = kp \u2212 (k1 \u2212 k2 ). A few methods can be employed to\n\nseparate the signal wave from the probe and pumps. The simplest one [illustrated in Fig.\n1(a)] requires an increase of the angles made by the three primary wave with the z axis\n\nsufficient to provide a clear angular resolution. The other two involve both the use of a\npolarization beam splitter (to distinguish between probe, pump 1 and signal) or a spectral\nfilter (that can distinguish between pump 2 and signal). Finally, a photodetector (PD) is\nused to detect the photon number of the signal field. In the following, we consider the\ndynamics of an atom located inside the sample, at position r.\nThe three incoming pulses are represented as c number traveling waves\nE(i) (r, t) =\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nEi (r, t)ei(ki *r\u2212\u03a9i t) + Ei\u2217 (r, t)e\u2212i(ki *r\u2212\u03a9i t) b\n\u01ebi ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, p, with polarization unit vectors b\n\u01ebi .

The rapid time variation of \u03c323 , at frequency\n\u03a9s = \u03a9p \u2212 (\u03a91 \u2212 \u03a92 ) has already been eliminated. The terms giving a spatial modulation\nat the correct, phase-matched wave vector ks = kp \u2212 (k1 \u2212 k2 ), have to be identified in Eq.\n(4(i)).\nWe proceed to describe the dynamics of the atom by using a perturbative approach to\nsolve Eqs. (4), in which terms up to the third order in \u03c7/\u2206i (\u03c7 = \u03c71 , \u03c72 , \u03c73 and \u2206i =\n\u2206, \u2206p , \u03b4) are kept. We start with an x polarized state of the two-level system formed by\n0\n0\nthe ground sublevels 1 and 2, where \u03c311 (0) = \u03c311\n= 1/2, \u03c322 (0) = \u03c322\n= 1/2, \u03c312 (0) =\n0\n0\n\u03c312\n= \u03c321 (0) = \u03c321\n= \u22121/2. Owing to the assumptions of large detunings and long duration\n\npulses, the upper state population operators \u03c3ii can be neglected. The coherences between\nground and excited states adiabatically follow the fields. Assuming \u03b4 \u226a \u2206, \u2206p , the first\n\n6\n\n\forder solution of Eqs.

The system formed by the two\nground sublevels is driven by an effective field with a Rabi frequency [\u03c7\u22171 (t)\u03c72 (t)/\u2206] multiplied by a spatial phase, dependent on the atom's position inside the medium: e\u2212i(k1 \u2212k2 )*r .\nIn the copropagating pumps geometry, this spatial modulation is negligibly small over the\nlength of the medium since |k1 \u2212 k2 | L \u2243 \u03c921 L/c \u226a 1. In addition, assuming \u03c71 (t) and\n* (2)\n\n\u03c72 (t) are real, the resulting effective Rabi frequency is real. The \u03c3 11 is, in consequence,\nvanishing for any atom inside the medium, independent on its location. Also, owing to the\n*\n\nfact that equal the ground state populations are equal, the \u03c3 12 vanishes to this order as well;\nin consequence the system stays in a dark state with equal populations and coherence along\nthe x axis.\nThe two coherences, \u03c334 and \u03c312 , that act as sources in Eq. (4i), are not driven directly\nby the field; their change from initial values is a second order contribution. They can be\nderived from Eqs. (4h,j), which give\n\u0003\n\u039b\u2217p (r, t) \u0002\n0\n0\n\u039b1 (r, t)\u03c311\n+ \u039b2 (r, t)\u03c312\n,\n\u2206\u2206p\n\u0003\n\u039b1 (r, t)\u039b\u22172(r, t) \u0002 0\n(2)\n0\n0\n\u03c312 (t) = \u03c312\n+\n\u03c311 \u2212 \u03c322\n.\n\u2206\u03b4\n(2)\n\n\u03c334 (t) \u2243\n\n(7a)\n(7b)\n\nWe are now in position to evaluate the third order approximation of \u03c323 . Replacing Eqs.\n\n7\n\n\f(7) in Eq. (4i), one obtains\n(3)\n\n\u03c323 (t) \u2243\n\n\u0003\n\u039bp (r, t) 0\n\u039b\u2217 (r, t)\u039b2 (r, t)\u039bp (r, t) \u0002 0\n0\n\u03c311 \u2212 \u03c322\n\u03c321 + 1\n\u2212\n\u2206p\n\u2206\u2206p \u03b4\n\n(8)\n\n|\u039b2 (r, t)|2 \u039bp (r, t) 0\n\u039b\u22171 (r, t)\u039b2(r, t)\u039bp (r, t) 0\n\u03c311 \u2212\n\u03c321 .\n\u2212\n\u2206\u22062p\n\u2206\u22062p\n\nTwo of the terms in the above expression [first and fourth in the right hand side of Eq. (8)]\ndescribe a field propagating in the direction of kp , which is not phase matched [kp 6= \u03a9s /c].\nBoth other terms give rise to a phase matched signal field; however, in the limit \u03b4 \u226a \u2206p\nthe third term is negligible compared to the second one, and is dropped. With the notation\n\u03c3z = (\u03c322 \u2212 \u03c311 ) /2, the expression of \u03c323 can be simplified\n\u03c323 (t) =\n\n\u039b\u22171 (r, t)\u039b2 (r, t)\u039bp (r, t)\n[\u03c311 \u2212 \u03c322 ] .\n\u2206\u2206p \u03b4\n\n(9)\n\nThe analysis is not complete before the role of spontaneous decay is properly identified.\nThe conditions imposed on the fields guarantee that the effective driving pulse doesn't\nremove the system from the dark state; spontaneous decay can still destroy the coherence,\nas is the case in [17]. However, we start by making an observation on a simple system\nof a \u039b atom driven by two equal fields, in which, on each of the two transitions, Raman\nand Rayleigh scatterings cancel each other, leading to a state not affected by spontaneous\nemission. Our case is similar to this, although not completely identical. In the absence\nof the probe field, an initially balanced state (equal populations in the ground substates)\nwith \u22121/2 coherence, would be preserved by choosing equal amplitude pumps. The probe\nfield provides an imbalance in the system, which can be compensated by choosing a field\nstrength on the 2 \u2192 4 transition larger than the one on the 1 \u2192 4 transition by an amount\n\nthat cancels the effect of the probe. This condition is \u03b3 \u2032 (\u03c721 \u2212 \u03c722 )/\u22062 = \u03b3\u03c72p (t)/\u22062p and is\n\nobtained by imposing the condition that the decay terms in the rate equations for \u03c311 (t) and\n\u03c322 (t) are identically zero. In addition, the coherence between the ground sublevels follows\nthe fields with a slowly varying value of \u2212(\u03c71 /\u03c72 )/2. By limiting the intensity of the probe\nfield to small values compared to the pump field intensities, this coherence stays close to the\nmaximal value of \u22121/2 throughout the interaction. The maintainance of coherence is the key\nfeature of this level scheme, allowing for much better spin squeezing than in other projection\nschemes. A similar idea was used to improve spin squeezing in cavity-field interactions [18]\n.\n8\n\n\fIII.\n\nEMITTED FIELD\n\nA wave equation for the signal field can be written where the polarization of the medium\nacts as a source. Defining the positive frequency part of the polarization resulting from a\n(+)\nsingle atom (denoted by \u03b1) located at position r as Pb\u03b1 (t) = Pb\u03b1 (t)ei(ks z\u2212\u03a9s t) , its envelope\nis given by\n\nPb\u03b1 (t) = ~ [d23 \u03c323 (t) + h.c.]\n\n(10)\n\nThe assumption of Fresnel number close to unity for the pencil-shaped medium can be\ninvoked now; this leads to a one-dimensional behavior of the propagation of the signal field.\nIn consequence, as in Refs. [19, 20], z dependent continuous operators can be defined by\nperforming an average over infinitesimal slices in the transverse direction of the medium.\nThe continuous polarization operator is thus defined as\n1 P b\nP\u03b1 (t),\n\u2206z\u21920 \u2206Vz \u03b1\u2208\u2206Vz\n\nPb(z, t) = lim\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2206Vz = A\u2206z is the volume of a slice and the sum is performed over all atoms in the\nslice (number of atoms in a slice Nz = na A\u2206z). Continuous atomic operators can also be\ndefined as\nP\nb\u03b1 (t).\nb t) = lim 1\nO\nO(z,\n\u2206z\u21920 Nz \u03b1\u2208\u2206Vz\n\n(12)\n\nReplacing the expression for \u03c323 previously derived in Eq. (10) and making use of continuous\natomic operators, Eq. (11) becomes:\nPb(z, t) = ~na d23 f (t) [\u03c311 (z) \u2212 \u03c322 (z)] .\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the notation f (t) = \u03c7\u22171 (t)\u03c72 (t)\u03c7p (t)/\u2206\u2206p \u03b4 has been made.As in Ref. [19, 20], the\nb(+) (z, t) =\nquantized signal field amplitude (the positive frequency part) can be written as E\np\nbs (z, t)ei(ks z\u2212\u03a9st) , where Es =\nbs (z, t) is a slowly varying envelope\nEs E\n~\u03a9s /2\u01eb0 AL and E\n\noperator. The wave equation in terms of slowly varying field and polarization envelope\noperators can be written as\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\nks b\n1\nb\nP (z, t).\n\u2202z + \u2202t Es (z, t) = \u2212i\nc\n2\u01eb0\n\n(14)\n\nSetting K(t) = ~ks d23 f (t)/2\u01eb0 , we find that population fluctuations at each point in the\nmedium are connected to the signal field by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nbs (z, t) = \u2212ina K(t) [\u03c311 (z) \u2212 \u03c322 (z)] .\n\u2202z + \u2202t E\nc\n9\n\n(15)\n\n\fIf collective atomic operators are defined\nNa\nSz =\n2L\n\nZL\n\ndz [\u03c311 (z) \u2212 \u03c322 (z)] ,\n\n(16)\n\n0\n\nthe solution for Eq. (15) is found [for derivation see Appendix A] to be\nbs (L, t) = E\nbs (0, t) \u2212 i 2K(t) Sz .\nE\nA\n\n(17)\n\nThe result states that the signal field amplitude exiting the sample is amplified by a\nquantity proportional to the collective population operator. The factor 2[K(t)/A]Sz can\nalso be reexpressed as na [2Sz /Na ]L, which shows a linear increase with the length and\natomic number density of the sample. The intensity of the emitted field can be calculated\nas an expectation value\n2\nD\nE\nbs (L, t)E\nb\u2020 (L, t) = 4 |K(t)| S 2 .\nIs \u223c E\nz\ns\nA2\n\n(18)\n\nAn initial population imbalance in the ground substates gives rise to a signal quadratic\nin the number of atoms in the sample. However, when the collective state of the system is a\ncoherent one, polarized along the x direction, for example, population fluctuations only are\nreflected in the emitted field. The variance of Sz is in this case Na2 /4, which leads to a gain\nin the field intensity, linear in number of atoms.\n\nIV.\n\nEFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN AND ENTANGLEMENT GENERATION\n\nThe conditional atomic generation process is similar to an EPR-type experiment, where\nentanglement is created between two subsystems (medium and signal field, in our case)\nby means of an interaction that lasts a finite time (duration of pulses); a measurement\n(detection of signal photon number) is performed on one of the subsystems (field) long after\nthe interaction has ceased. Consequently, the other subsystem (atoms) is projected onto\nthe state entangled with the state indicated by the detection outcome. A wave function\napproach (or density matrix, when imperfect detection is accounted for) can be taken to\ndescribe the coupled evolution of the two subsystems, while a continuous measurement\ntheory is particularized to this case to describe the nondeterministic evolution of the system\nduring the detection process.\n10\n\n\fThe results of Ref. [17] are used in what follows. The complete details of the derivation\nof an effective Hamiltonian are found in Appendix C of Ref. [17], where a similar calculation\nis described. The measurement process, both under the assumption of perfect detection and\nincluding imperfect detectors, is also presented in details in Sec. V. of Ref. [17]. We are\nconcerned here, rather with the main differences between our proposed scheme and the ones\nproposed elsewhere.\nThe interaction between the signal field amplitude operator and the atoms in the sample\nis written in the Heisenberg picture. An integration over the transverse wave vector components of the generated field (allowed by the assumption of Fresnel number close to unity)\nfollowed by one over x and y leads to a one-dimensional formulation of the problem, where\nthe continuous atomic operators are specified only by their z spatial location, while the field\nhas a transverse spatial extent A (matching the cross-sectional area of the medium) [see also\n[20]]. The coherence between levels 2 and 3 is thereafter replaced, using Eq.

(where S = Na /2).\nAfter a period of coherent evolution governed by the evolution operator U(T ) [Eq.

The results are similar to the ones presented in [17] (the reader is refered to\nthat publication for relevant discussions and graphs), with one important exception. In [17],\np\nthe value of C is limited to small values (C \u2264 (na \u03bb2 L)/2Na ) to insure that spontaneous\n\nemission does not lead to mean spin depolarization. Here, that restriction does not apply\nsince the total coherence is not seriously affected by spontaneous emission. In consequence,\nthe results obtained here overlap with the ideal case presented in [17], where spin squeezing\nclose to the Heisenberg limit and well-resolved Schrodinger cat states can be obtained.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe presented a probabilistic scheme in which the detection of photon number induces\nthe collapse of the quantum state of a collection of atoms onto either a spin squeezed or a\nSchrodinger cat state. The main result of the paper is that spontaneous decay does not play\n12\n\n\fa critical role in the decoherence of the system, therefore allowing one to obtain a squeezing\nparameter close to the Heisenberg limit (assuming perfect detection). This has been done by\nmaintaining the system in a dark state by choosing the appropriate configuration of driving\npulses.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. PHY0244841 and the FOCUS Center grant.\n\nVII.\n\n\u221e\nR\n0\n\nAPPENDIX : SOLUTION FOR THE FIELD EQUATION\n\nUsing the Laplace transform with respect with z (defined as o(s) = L {O(z)} =\nn\no\nbs (z, t) and \u03c3z (s) = L {\u03c3z (z)} Eq.
