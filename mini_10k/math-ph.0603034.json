One of the most important concerns a\ntime-dispersive dissipative (TDD) dielectric medium and the fundamental problem of\ndefining and studying the eigenmodes and, more generally, the spectral theory. Similar problems arise when considering an \"open resonator\" (or Helmholtz resonator),\n1\n\n\fwhich is a regular resonator coupled to an exterior system with an absolutely continuos spectrum. A third problem originates in statistical mechanics, when one considers\na finite cube or slab as a small part of an ideal solid, modeled by a lattice array of\ncoupled oscillators, and wonders how much information can be extracted about the\nentire solid from observations made only from within the finite part. The common\nfeature of above dynamical systems is that they are open, in other words, the time\ndynamics do not preserve the energy and/or the material but exchange them with\nan exterior which often is not observable. It turns out that it is possible to reach\nsome interesting conclusions about properties of open systems based on their minimal conservative extensions introduced recently in [2]. This is the subject of this\npaper.\nAs an indication of some of what lies ahead, we mention a \"toy\" example of a\nmechanical system, which we discuss in Section 3. The example shows how a high\ndegree of symmetry in the system, which is related to high spectral multiplicity of\nthe governing operator, results in many motions of the system being unaffected by\na coupling to another system of \"hidden\" variables. Indeed, comparisons of the\ncomputation of the specific heat of a crystalline solid to experiment indicate that\ncertain motions, or degrees of freedom, of the structure have to be left out-they are\n\"frozen\" [4, Section 3.1], [5, Section 6.4]. One of our main theorems (Theorem 15)\napplies to this type of situation-it describes how the multiplicity of the modes of\na system that are affected by a coupling to another system is bounded by the rank\nof the coupling. Another example of a possible application of this work is one that\ninspired us to begin the study, although we do not pursue it at this point. It concerns\na periodic dielectric waveguide that admits \"nonrobust\" modes at certain isolated\nwave number and frequency pairs. These are true (nonleaky) modes that become\nleaky through radiation loss under perturbation of the frequency or wavenumber.\nThe system of modes in the waveguide and the exterior system, characterized by\nextended states in the surrounding air, become coupled, and this coupling produces\ninteresting transmission anomalies [10].\nOne can think of two intimately related and complementing ways to define an\nopen system: (i) intrinsic description by a non-conservative evolution equation; (ii)\nas a subsystem of a conservative system. Taking the intrinsic description as basic we\ndefine an open system as one governed by a causal time-homogeneous linear evolution\nequation\nZ \u221e\nm\u2202t v (t) = \u2212iAv (t) \u2212\na (\u03c4 ) v (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f (t) , v (t) \u2208 H1 ,\n(1)\n0\n\nin which H1 is a separable Hilbert space, m and A are self-adjoint operators in H1\nwith m > 0, and f (t) is an external force in H1 . We always assume that the system is\n2\n\n\fat rest for negative times t \u2264 0, in other words the following rest condition is satisfied\nv (t) = 0, f (t) = 0 for t \u2264 0.\n\n(2)\n\nThe integral term in (1) involving the operator-valued response function a (\u03c4 ) is a\nsubject to the dissipation (no-gain) condition\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\nRe\nv (t)a (\u03c4 ) v (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) dt d\u03c4 \u2265 0 for all v(t) with compact support. (3)\n0\n\n0\n\nEvidently, the integral term in (1) is responsible for the non-conservative, or open,\nnature of the system. Its form explicitly accounts for the system's causality and\ntime-homogeneity. The friction function a(t) represents both delayed response and\ninstantaneous friction; thus we take it to be of the form\na(t) = a\u221e \u03b4(t) + \u03b1(t),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the coefficient of instantaneous friction a\u221e is a bounded non-negative operator\nin H1 and the delayed response function \u03b1(t) is strongly continuous and bounded\nas an operator-valued function of t with respect the norm in B(H1 ), the space of\nbounded operators in H1 .\nThe other important view on an open system is that it is a subsystem of a given\nconservative (conservative) system (H, A), described by conservative evolution equation\nM\u2202t V (t) = \u2212iAV (t) + F (t) , V, F \u2208 H,\n(5)\nwhere H is a separable Hilbert space, A is a self-adjoint operator in it, and F (t) is\nan external force, with a subsystem identified by a subspace H1 \u2282 H. We refer to\nthe subsystem's space H1 as the observable variables.\nAn intimate relation between the two ways of looking at open systems can be\ndescribed as follows, [2], [3]:\n\n(i) an open system defined by (1) and satisfying (3) can always be represented as\na subsystem of a conservative extension in the form (5), and, if minimal, such\nan extension is unique up to isomorphism;\n(ii) the evolution of a subsystem of a conservative system (5) can be represented in\nthe form (1) with a friction function a(t) satisfying (3).\nMore precisely, taking the subsystem point of view on an open system we can\nidentify an open system (1) with a subsystem of its minimal conservative extension\n(H, A) in which a subspace H1 \u2282 H acts as the space of observable variables. Then\nwe define the open system's exterior as the orthogonal complement H2 = H \u2296 H1 ,\n3\n\n\freferring to it as the hidden variables. Having the decomposition H = H1 \u2295 H2 we\ncan recast the evolution equation (5) into the following system (see [2, Section 2]).\nm1 \u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212iAv1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) + f1 (t) , m1 > 0, A is self-adjoint,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u03a92 v2 (t) , \u03a92 is self-adjoint,\n\nwhere v1 \u2208 H1 , v2 \u2208 H2 , and \u0393 : H2 \u2192 H1 is the coupling operator. By its very form,\nthe system (6), involving the coupling operator \u0393 and its adjoint \u0393\u2020 : H1 \u2192 H2 , is\nexplicitly conservative, and \u0393\u2020 and \u0393 determine the channels of \"communication\" from\nthe observable to the hidden and back from the hidden to the observable. Observe\nthat if one solves the second equation in (6) for v2 (t) and inserts it into the first\nequation, the resulting equation will be of the form (1) with friction function\na(t) = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 ,\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(7)\n\nwhich, as is easy to verify, always satisfies the dissipation condition (3).\nIn a typical example of an open system embedded within a given conservative\nsystem, this conservative system is not necessarily minimal as a conservative extension\nof the open system. The minimal conservative extension is often much simpler system\nthan the original one. For instance, a time dispersive and dissipative (TDD) dielectric\nmedium, as described by the Maxwell equations with frequency dependent electric\npermittivity \u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u03bc, constitutes an open system. Note that\nsuch \u03b5 and \u03bc arise through the interaction of the electromagnetic fields with the\nmolecular structure of the matter, which plays the part of the hidden variables. But\nif, however, \u03b5 and \u03bc are all that is known, clearly these functions would not allow one\nto reconstruct the full molecular structure of the matter but rather only its minimal\nconservative extension.\nAnother simple but instructive example is provided by a general scalar (onedimensional) open system as described by (1) with H1 = C and friction function\na (t) satisfying (3) and (4). Observe that the classical damped oscillator with a(t) =\na\u221e \u03b4(t) is a particular case of such general scalar open system. The minimal conservative extension of a general scalar open system is described by a triplet {H2 , \u03a92 , \u0393}\nsuch that (7) holds and its elements H2 , \u03a92 and \u0393 are constructed as follows, [2,\nSection 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, A.2]. First, using the Bochner Theorem, we obtain the following\nrepresentation of the friction function\nZ \u221e\na (t) =\ne\u2212i\u03c9t dN (\u03c9)\n(8)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith a unique, non-decreasing, right-continuous bounded function N (\u03c9) defining a\nnonnegative measure N (d\u03c9) on the real line R. Then\nH2 = L2 (R, N (d\u03c9)) ,\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fthe operator \u03a92 is the multiplication by \u03c9 on L2 (R, N (d\u03c9)), i.e.\n[\u03a92 \u03c8] (\u03c9) = \u03c9\u03c8 (\u03c9) , \u03c9 \u2208 R, \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R, N (d\u03c9)) ,\nand the coupling operator \u0393 and its adjoint are\nZ \u221e\n\u0393 [\u03c8 (*)] =\n\u03c8 (\u03c9) N (d\u03c9) : L2 (R, dN) \u2192 C,\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0002 \u2020 \u0003\n\u0393 v (\u03c9) = v,\nv \u2208 C, \u03c9 \u2208 R.\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nConsequently, the minimal conservative extension of the form (6) becomes here\nZ \u221e\nm\u2202t v = \u2212iAv \u2212 i\n\u03c8 (\u03c9) d\u03c9 + f (t) ,\n(12)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2202t \u03c8 (\u03c9) = \u2212iv \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c8 (\u03c9) , \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R, N (d\u03c9)) .\n\nIn the case of the classical damped oscillator the measure N (d\u03c9) is just the Lebesque\nmeasure, i.e. N (d\u03c9) = d\u03c9, and the system (12) is equivalent to the Lamb model\n(see [6] and [3]), which is a point mass attached to a classical elastic string (with \u03c9\nbeing the wave number). In the case of a general spectral measure N (d\u03c9) one can\nview the minimal extension (12) as one obtained by attaching a point mass m to a\ngeneral \"string\" as described by a simple, i.e. multiplicity-one, self-adjoint operator\nwith the spectral measure N (d\u03c9). This point of view is justified bya fundamental\nconstruction due to M. G. Krein of a unique \"real\" string corresponding to any given\nspectral measure. This construction as a part of an exhaustive study of relations\nbetween the spectral measure, the corresponding admittance operator (the coefficient\nof dynamical compliance), and strings, is presented in two papers [11, 12] by I. S. Kac\nand M. G. Krein.\nTo clarify the exact meaning of a string, we give a brief description of a loaded\nstring S1 [0, L] on an interval [0, L], 0 \u2264 L \u2264 \u221e, as it is presented by Kac and Krein\n[11, 12]. We assume (i) the string S1 [0, L] has constant stiffness 1; (ii) a nondecreasing\nnonnegative function M (s), s \u2265 0, describes its mass distribution, with M (s) being\nthe total string mass on the interval [0, s]. The string states are complex-valued\nfunctions \u03c8 (s), 0 \u2264 s \u2264 L, from the Hilbert space L2 ([0, L] , M (ds)). The string\ndynamics is governed by the following equation\n\u22022\u03c8\n(s, t) = AM [\u03c8] (s, t) , 0 \u2264 s \u2264 L,\n\u2202t2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the string operator AM is defined by the expression\nAM [\u03c8] (s) = \u2212\n\nd d\u03c8\n(s) , 0 \u2264 s \u2264 L,\ndM (s) ds\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fwith the boundary conditions\n\u03c8 \u2032 (0) = 0, \u03c8 \u2032 (L) h + \u03c8 (L) = 0, where h is real.\n\n(15)\n\nWe do not formulate the original statements from [12, Theorem 11.1, 11.2], because\nof the considerable space needed to introduce and define all relevant concepts, but\ntheir principal point is that any nonnegative measure N (d\u03c9) on (\u22120, \u221e) satisfying\nthe condition\nZ \u221e\nN (d\u03c9)\n<\u221e\n(16)\n\u22120 1 + \u03c9\n\nis the spectral measure of a unique string as described by the self-adjoint operator\nAM defined by (14)-(15). In another words, given a nonnegative measure N (d\u03c9) on\nthe positive semiaxis (\u22120, \u221e) which satisfies the condition (16), one can construct a\nunique mass distribution M (s), so that the corresponding string S1 [0, L] has N (d\u03c9)\nas its spectral measure. As to the relation between N (d\u03c9) and M (s) a number of\ninsightful examples are provided in [12, Sections 11-13].\nObserve now that, if a scalar open system is described by (6), then regardless of\nhow complex the original triplet {H2 , \u03a92 , \u0393} is, its minimal counterpart {H2,min , \u03a92,min, \u0393min }\nis always of the universal form (12), and one can think of it as obtained by attaching\na string to a point mass. The concept of a string, as represented by the spectral\nmeasure N (d\u03c9) on R, turns out to be useful in describing the minimal extension of\na multidimensional open system, where one has to use a number of strings for its\nconstruction. In particular, we will introduce a rather simple string spectral decomposition for an arbitrary self-adjoint operator \u03a92 for which the number of strings equals\nexactly to the spectral multiplicity of \u03a92 , and a single string has always spectral multiplicity one. We use then the number of strings involved in the string decompositions\nto characterize their relative complexity.\nWe reiterate the important observation that follows from the above examples and\ndiscussion: the evolution of a subsystem is fully described by its minimal conservative\nextension similar to the system (12) which, typically, is substantially simpler than the\noriginal conservative system. Consequently, a significant part of the modes of the original system can be completely decoupled from the open system. These observations\nmake the minimal conservative extension an attractive instrument: (i) it is a simpler\nsubstitute for often enormously complex original conservative systems (as the atomic\nstructure of the matter), (ii) since it is conservative, the classical spectral theory is\navailable, and (iii) it provides information about how much of the original system is\nreconstructible by an observer in the open subsystem. Based on our considerations\nhitherto, we see our objectives as follows:\n(i) identify information about a conservative system that is carried by its subsystem\n(reconstructibility);\n6\n\n\f(ii) relate the unique minimal extension of an open system to a given \"original\"\nlarger conservative system;\n(iii) study the coupling operator of a subsystem and to identify which part of the\nsystem is coupled through it.\n(iv) understand the decomposition of open systems through simultaneous decompositions of the internal dynamics of the observable and hidden variables and the\ncoupling operator between them.\nOrganization of the paper. Section 2 gives precise definitions and concise\nmathematical discussions of the concepts introduced so far, which will serve as background for the development of the work.\nIn Section 3, we construct a toy model of a solid that has frozen degrees of freedom.\nThis example serves to illustrate the role that a high degree of system symmetry plays\nin decoupling parts of a dynamical system, as we have already discussed (page 2).\nSection 4 concerns the reconstructibility of conservative systems from open systems, in particular, from the dynamics projected to the observable and to the hidden\nstate variables. The section culminates in one of our main theorems, Theorem 15,\nwhich describes how the number of coupling channels between the observable and\nhidden variables bounds the number of strings required in the construction of the\nminimal extension.\nIn Section 5, we investigate the decomposition, or decoupling, of open systems by\nmeans of the minimal conservative extension. We show first the equivalence between\n(i) the decoupling of the dynamics in a subspace of the open system from the dynamics\nin the complementary part of the open system, which is determined by A1 and a(t),\nand (ii) splittings of the conservative extension that are invariant under A1 , \u03a92 , and \u0393,\nor, equivalently, that are preserved in H by \u03a9 and the projection operator to H1 . We\nthen make an analysis of the relation between splittings of the conservative extension\nH that preserve its dynamics (equivalently, splittings of the projected open system on\nH1 ) and the singular-value decomposition of the coupling operator \u0393. If the friction\nfunction involves no instantaneous friction component, that is, if a\u221e = 0, then the\ncoupling \u0393 is bounded; otherwise it will be unbounded. More general assumption\nwhen \u0393 is bounded with respect to the frequency operator \u03a92 , which covers the case\nof nonzero instanteneous fiction a\u221e , is considered in [2, Section 2.2]. In this work we\nfocus on the case of bounded coupling, in which the analysis is more transparent.\nTo preserve the conceptual transparency of the arguments and results and to make\nthem more readily accessible to the reader, we forgo full rigorous arguments in the\ndevelopment of the ideas and present more elaborate statements of the theorems as\nwell as their proofs in Section 6.\n\n7\n\n\f2\n\nConservative extension and spectral composition\n\nOur study of the general open linear DD system is based on the ability to embed it\nin a unique way into a larger conservative system, in which the observable system is\ncomplemented by a space of hidden degrees of freedom. The frequency operator for\nthe hidden variables gives rise to a (nonunique) decomposition of these variables into\nsubspaces that are interpreted as independent \"strings\" that are \"attached\" to the\nsystem of observable variables and account for the dissipative and dispersive effects\nthat cause this system to be open. Each string is characterized by a spectral measure,\nand exactly how they strings are attached to the observable variables is described by\nthe coupling operator. In this section, we give the background for constructing this\nconservative extension and discuss the spectral composition of the space of hidden\nvariables into strings and the structure of the coupling operator.\nWe reiterate our definition of an open linear DD system and the conditions it\nsatisfies. We take an open system to be of the form\nZ \u221e\nm\u2202t v (t) = \u2212iAv (t) \u2212\na (\u03c4 ) v (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f (t) , v (t) \u2208 H1 ,\n(17)\n0\n\nin which H1 is a separable Hilbert space, m and A are self-adjoint operators in H1\nwith m > 0, and f (t) is an external force in H1 . The function a(t) is subject the\ndissipation (no-gain) condition\n\nCondition 1 (dissipation) Let a(t) = a\u221e \u03b4(t) + \u03b1(t), where a\u221e is a bounded nonnegative operator in H1 and \u03b1(t) is a strongly continuous and bounded operator-valued\nfunction of t with respect the operator norm in B(H1 ). a(t) satisfies the dissipation\ncondition if\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\nRe\nv (t)a (\u03c4 ) v (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) dt d\u03c4 \u2265 0 for all v(t) with compact support. (18)\n0\n\n0\n\nThe systems we consider will satisfy the rest condition\nCondition 2 (rest condition) An open system satisfies the rest condition if, for\nall t < 0, f (t) = 0 and v(t) = 0.\nThe minimal extension. The following statement, which is a generalization\nof the Bochner theorem, plays the key role in the embedding of the open system (1)\ninto a unique minimal conservative extension (6) [2, Theorem 3.2]. Given that the\ndissipation condition (3) is satisfied, the Proposition 3 provides the existence of the\nspace H2 of hidden variables, the frequency operator \u03a92 for its internal dynamics,\nand the coupling operator \u0393.\n8\n\n\fProposition 3 (mimimal extension) Let B (H1 ) be the space of all bounded linear\noperators in H1 . Then a strongly continuous B (H1 )-valued function a (t), 0 \u2264 t < \u221e,\nis representable as\na (t) = \u0393e\u2212it\u03a92 \u0393\u2020 ,\n(19)\nwith \u03a92 a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space H2 and \u0393 : H1 \u2192 H2 a bounded linear\nmap, if and only if a (t) satisfies the dissipation condition (3) for every continuous H1\nvalued function v(t) with compact support. If the space H2 is minimal-in the sense\nthat the linear span\nf (\u03a92 ) \u0393\u2020 v : f \u2208 Cc (R) , v \u2208 H1\n(20)\nis dense in H2 -then the triplet {H2 , \u03a92 , \u0393} is determined uniquely up to an isomorphism.\nRemark 4 In fact, it is sufficient to assume that a(t) is locally bounded and strongly\nmeasurable, strong continuity then follows from (19).\nSince, as it turns out, spans similar to (20) arise often in the analysis of open\nsystems, we name them closed orbits and define them as follows.\nDefinition 5 (orbit) Let \u03a9 be a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space H and S is\na subset of vectors in H. Then we define the closed orbit (or simply orbit) O\u03a9 (S) of\nS under action of \u03a9 by\nO\u03a9 (S) = closure of span {f (\u03a9)w : f \u2208 Cc (R), w \u2208 S} .\n\n(21)\n\nIf H \u2032 is a subspace of H such that O\u03a9 (H \u2032 ) = H \u2032 , then H \u2032 is said to be invariant with\nrespect to \u03a9 or simply \u03a9-invariant.\nIf \u03a9 is bounded, the orbit O\u03a9 (S) is equal to the smallest subspace of H containing\nS that is invariant, or closed, under \u03a9. Equivalently, it is the smallest subspace of\nH containing S that is invariant under (\u03a9 \u2212 i)\u22121 ; this latter formulation is also valid\nfor unbounded operators. The relevant theory can be found, for example, in [1] or\n[7]. The orbit of S under the of two self-adjoint operators \u03a9 and A can be defined by\napplication of continuous functions of \u03a9 and A to elements of S, but we shall only\nneed the characterization that\nO\u03a9,A (S) is the smallest subspace of H containing S\nthat is invariant under (\u03a9 \u2212 i)\u22121 and (A \u2212 i)\u22121 . (22)\nProposition 3 allows one uniquely to construct the triple {H2 , \u03a92 , \u0393} and, consequently, the minimal conservative extension based on the observable friction function\n9\n\n\fa(t). In fact, there is a statement similar to Proposition 3 which holds for a (t) of the\nmost general form (4), in which instantaneous friction is included; see [2, Theorem\n7.1]. Consideration of the instantaneous friction term leads to an unbounded coupling\noperator \u0393; the treatment of unbounded coupling is technical, and we do not consider\nit in this work, but treat it in a forthcoming exposition.\nIt is worthwhile to understand the idea behind the construction of the triple\n{H2 , \u03a92 , \u0393}, as it shows plainly how the time-harmonic decomposition of a(t) determines the spectral structure of H2 . We therefore take a page to explain it. Introduce\nthe Fourier-Laplace transform of a(t):\nZ \u221e\n\u00e2(\u03b6) =\na(t)ei\u03b6t dt, for I\u03b6 > 0.\n(23)\n0\n\nIt turns out that the dissipation condition, Condition 1, on a(t) is equivalent to the\ncondition that \u00e2(\u03b6) is a Nevanlinna function: it is an analytic function of the open\nupper half plane with values that have positive real (self-adjoint) part. The restriction\nof the real part of \u00e2(\u03b6) to the real line (\u00e2(\u03c9) for \u03c9 \u2208 R is the Fourier transform of a(t))\nis no longer a classical function in general, but rather a nonnegative operator-valued\nmeasure dN(\u03c9). One then takes H2 to be the space of square-integrable functions\nfrom R to H1 with respect to this measure:\nH2 = L2 (R, H1, dN(\u03c9)),\nfor which the inner product is defined by\nZ\n1\nhf (\u03c9)|dN(\u03c9) g(\u03c9)iH1 ,\nhf |giH2 =\n\u03c0 R\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nwith the integral understood in the Lebesgue-Stieltjes sense. The operator \u03a92 is\nsimply multiplication by \u03c9:\n(\u03a92 (g))(\u03c9) = \u03c9g(\u03c9) for g \u2208 H2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nthe adjoint \u0393\u2020 : H1 \u2192 H2 of the coupling operator is defined by sending v \u2208 H1 to\nthe function with constant value v:\n(\u0393\u2020 (v))(\u03c9) = v\n\nfor all \u03c9 \u2208 R\n\n(27)\n\nand \u0393 : H2 \u2192 H1 is given by\n1\n\u0393(f ) =\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03c9) dN(\u03c9).\n\nR\n\n10\n\n(28)\n\n\fOne can check that this extension indeed produces the friction function a(t) by observing that, since \u00e2(\u03b6) is a Nevanlinna function, it is constructible from dN(\u03c9) by\nthe Cauchy transform:\nZ\n1\n1\ni\u00e2(\u03b6) =\ndN(\u03c9),\n(29)\n\u03c0 R \u03b6 \u2212\u03c9\nand when applied to a vector v \u2208 H1 , gives\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(\u0393 (v)(\u03c9))dN(\u03c9) = \u0393\n\u0393 v,\ni\u00e2(\u03b6)v =\n\u03c0 R \u03b6 \u2212 \u03a92\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u03a92\n\n(30)\n\nwhich is the Fourier-Laplace transform of (\u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 )v.\nThe coupling channels. Now let us understand the structure of the coupling\noperator \u0393 well. There is a canonical isomorphism between the ranges of \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 :\nU : Ran \u0393 \u2192 Ran \u0393\u2020 .\n\n(31)\n\nThis isomorphism is constructed as follows: Observe that\nH1 = Ran \u0393 \u2295 Null \u0393\u2020\n\nand H2 = Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2295 Null \u0393\n\n(32)\n\nso that \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 are determined by their actions on Ran \u0393\u2020 and Ran \u0393, respectively.\nDenote their restrictions to these subspaces (both in domain and target space) by\n\u0393R = \u0393\u21beRan (\u0393\u2020 ) and \u0393\u2020R = \u0393\u2020\u21beRan (\u0393) = (\u0393R )\u2020 .\n\n(33)\n\nU is then given explicitly by\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121/2\nU = \u0393\u2020R \u0393R\n\u0393\u2020R = \u0393\u2020R \u0393R \u0393\u2020R\n.\n\n(34)\n\nThe positive operators (\u0393R \u0393\u2020R )1/2 on Ran \u0393 and (\u0393\u2020R \u0393R )1/2 on Ran \u0393\u2020 have trivial\nnullspace and are related through U by1\n\u0393\u2020R\n\n\u00111/2 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\n\u2020\n\u2020\n= U \u0393R \u0393R\n= \u0393R \u0393R\nU.\n\n(35)\n\nIt is not always necessary to deal with the restrictions \u0393R or \u0393\u2020R ; often \u0393 or \u0393\u2020 itself is suitable.\nFor example, \u0393\u0393\u2020 and \u0393R \u0393\u2020R coincide on the domain of the latter, and the former maps the orthogonal\ncomplement of this domain to zero. The analogous statement holds for \u0393\u2020 \u0393 and \u0393\u2020R \u0393R .\nU \u22121 :\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u0010\n, and \u0393 has the polar\nRan \u0393\u2020 \u2192 Ran \u0393 is given by U \u22121 = U \u2020 = \u0393R \u0393\u2020R\n\u0393R = \u0393R \u0393\u2020R \u0393R\n\u00111/2 \u0010\n\u00111/2\n\u0010\n= \u0393R \u0393\u2020R\nU \u22121 .\ndecompositions \u0393R = U \u22121 \u0393\u2020R \u0393R\n1\n\n11\n\n\fThis is the polar decomposition of \u0393\u2020 . It allows one to define the \"coupling channels\"\nin a natural way as the pairing of the eigenmodes of the positive part (\u0393R \u0393\u2020R )1/2 in\nRan \u0393 \u2282 H1 with the corresponding eigenmodes of (\u0393\u2020R \u0393R )1/2 in Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2282 H2 through\nU. \u0393\u2020 and \u0393 provide a direct coupling between these modes-hence the term \"coupling\nchannel\". In the case of unbounded coupling or continuous spectrum, the modes are\nnot genuine vectors, but are members of a appropriate furnishings of H1 and H2 . For\ncontinuous spectrum, we may also define coupling channels more generally as pairs\nof spaces identified through U that are fixed by the positive operators in (35) and\ntherefore mapped to one another by \u0393\u2020 and \u0393. We use this structure amply in Section\n5, which deals with decomposition of open systems.\nDefinition 6 (coupling channel) A coupling channel is a pair (S1 , S2 ), in which\nS1 is an invariant space of (\u0393R \u0393\u2020R )1/2 in Ran \u0393 \u2282 H1 and S2 is an invariant space of\n(\u0393\u2020R \u0393R )1/2 in Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2282 H2 such that U(S1 ) = S2 (see (31) and (34) for the definition\nof U). If follows that \u0393\u2020 (S1 ) = S2 and \u0393(S2 ) = S1 . A simple coupling channel is\na coupling channel in which the members S1 and S2 are one-dimensional. A simple\ncoupling channel corresponds to a pair of eigenmodes (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) of \u0393\u0393\u2020 and \u0393\u2020 \u0393 for the\nsame eigenvalue.\nThe extending strings. The conservative system (H2 , \u03a92 ), consisting of the\nspace of hidden variables together with its operator of internal dynamics, can be interpreted as a set of independent abstract \"strings\" to which the system (H1 , m, A) is\nattached by the coupling channels defined by \u0393. The following spectral decomposition\nof H2 with respect to \u03a92 is obtained by a straightforward modification of Theorem\nVII.6 in [7]:\nM\nM\n\u223c\nH2 =\nL2 (R, C, d\u03bcj (\u03c9)), d\u03bcj+1 \u0016 d\u03bcj ,\n(36)\nj=1\n\nin which \"\u0016\" denotes absolute continuity of measures and \u03a9 is represented by multiplication by the independent variable \u03c9. We call each component of this decomposition\na \"string\"; the j-th string is generated by a function fj (\u03c9) of maximal spectral type\nin L2 (R, C, d\u03bcj (\u03c9)), that is, fj (\u03c9) 6= 0 almost everywhere with repect to d\u03bcj . A string\nis characterized by its invariance under the action of \u03a92 and by the property that the\nrestriction of \u03a9 to the string has multiplicity 1. Of course, the measures \u03bcj need not\nbe taken to be nested by absolute continuity; even if they are, a decomposition into\nstrings is not unique. The strings are decoupled from each other with respect to the\naction of \u03a92 , that is, within the conservative system (H2 , \u03a92 ).\n\nDefinition 7 (string) An abstract string, or simply a string in the system (H2 , \u03a92 ),\nis a subsystem (S, \u03a92 \u21beS), in which S is a \u03a92 -invariant subspace of H2 and the restriction \u03a92 \u21beS of \u03a92 to S has multiplicity 1. A string decomposition of (H2 , \u03a92 ) is\n12\n\n\fan expression of (H2 , \u03a92 ) as a direct sum of strings:\nH2 =\n\nM\nM\n\nH2j , ,\n\n\u03a92 =\n\nj=1\n\nM\nM\n\n\u03a92\u21beH2j ,\n\n(37)\n\nj=1\n\nin which each (H2j , \u03a92\u21beH2j ) is a string in (H2 , \u03a9).\nEvidently, the isomorphism (36) gives a string decomposition of H2 . In view of\nthe corresponding representation of \u03a92 as multiplication by the independent variable\n\u03c9, construction of a decomposition of H2 into strings is accomplished abstractly as\nfollows: Choose a vector v1 \u2208 H2 of maximal spectral type with respect to \u03a92 and\nobtain H21 = O\u03a92 (v1 ) \u223c\n= L2 (R, C, d\u03bc1 (\u03c9)). Then, if O\u03a92 (v1 ) 6= H2 , choose a vector v2\nof maximal spectral type in O\u03a92 (v1 )\u22a5 and obtain H22 = O\u03a92 (v2 ) \u223c\n= L2 (R, C, d\u03bc2 (\u03c9)),\nand so on. This infinite iterative process will produce a direct sum of the form (37).\nHowever, if the vectors vn are chosen at will, this sum may not be all of H2 : it\nmay have an orthogonal complement, within H2 , in which \u03a92 has uniform infinite\nmultiplicity. One must be sure to include this part in the string decomposition. The\nstructure provided by (36) shows that this is indeed possible.\nThe number M (which may be infinite) in the spectral representation (36) is the\nmultiplicity of the operator \u03a92 ; M is the maximal multiplicity of any of the spectral\nvalues of \u03a92 .\nDiscussion. The coupling of the observable variables H1 to the strings is accomplished through the coupling channels defined by \u0393. Of course, there is in general no\nrelation between a given decomposition of H2 into strings and the coupling channels.\nIf the strings can be chosen in such a way that the coupling channels split into two\nsets, one of which couples into one set of strings and the other of which couples into\nthe complementary set of strings, and the H1 -members of the two sets of channels are\ncontained in orthogonal orbits of \u03a91 , then the open system (H1 , \u03a91 , a(t)) is decomposed into decoupled systems. We pursue a detailed study of the decoupling of open\nsystems using their conservative extensions in Section 5.\nIn a typical example in which it is known that the open system (H1 , m, A1 , a(t))\nis obtained naturally as the restriction of the dynamics of a given larger conservative\nsystem (H, \u03a9) to a subspace of observable variables H1 \u2282 H (as the open system of\nelectromagnetic fields in a lossy medium or a crystalline solid in contact with a heat\nbath), the given conservative system is not necessarily minimal. The space of hidden\nvariables for the minimal extension is actually a subspace of the given H2 = H \u2296 H1 .\nWe call this subspace the \"coupled\" part of H2 and denote it by H2c . H2c coincides\nwith H2 if (H, \u03a9) is minimal.\nOne of our main results concerns the situation in which there exist only finitely\nmany simple coupling channels. This is the case that the rank of \u0393 is finite, such as in\n13\n\n\flattice systems, as we discuss in some detail as a motivating example in the following\nsection. The result gives quantitative information about the size of H2c within H2 .\nAs H1 acts as the \"hidden\" variables for a hypothetical observer in H2 , we have also\nan analogous result about the size of H1c within H1 , where H1c is the part of H1 that\nis reconstructible from the dynamics restricted to H2 (or H2c ):\nThe (minimal) number of strings needed to extend an open system to a conservative one is no greater than the number of independent simple coupling\nchannels between the spaces of observable and hidden variables.\nThe coupled part of the observable variable space has multiplicity (with respect\nto \u03a91 ) that is no greater than the number of independent simple coupling\nchannels between the spaces of observable and hidden variables.\nThis result is stated precisely as Theorem 15 in Section 4, and its sigificance is discussed in Section 3.\n\n3\n\nOpen systems and frozen degrees of freedom\n\nWe illustrate through a quite concrete example that certain degrees of freedom of\na DD system can be \"frozen\": they are not affected by the interaction with the\nhidden variables that causes the energy-dissipation effects. Thus a component of\nthe state space that is \"decoupled\" from the hidden variables evolves conservatively,\nindependent of the \"coupled\" DD part. This section may serve as a motivation for\nour detailed study in Section 4.\nConsider a crystalline solid in contact with a heat bath. It has been observed that\ncertain degrees of freedom of the solid do not contribute to its specific heat [4, Section\n3.1], [5, Section 6.4]. The calculation of the specific heat by the Dulong-Petit law is\nbased on the law of equipartition of energy and the number of degrees of freedom.\nFor that calculation to agree with the experiment, one has to leave out some degrees\nof freedom as if they were \"frozen\" and cannot be excited by the heat bath. In other\nwords, there are system motions which are completely decoupled from the solid and\nheat bath interaction-they cannot be reached through the combination of surface\ncontact and internal dynamics of the solid.\nTo find a sufficiently general scenario for such frozen degress of freedom we consider\nan open system decribed by the variable v1 \u2208 H1 as a part of the conservative system\n(6). We notice then that it is conceivable that the open system has a part not coupled\nto its exterior. In other words, there is an orthogonal decomposition\nH1 = H1c \u2295 H1d ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the subspaces H1c and H1d correspond to states coupled to and decoupled from\n14\n\n\fthe hidden variable v2 \u2208 H2 . To figure out the decompositon (38) we set m1 = 1\nin (6) (the general case is reduced to this one by proper renormalization of v1 ), and\nconsider the system\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) , \u03a91 = \u03a9\u20201\n\u2020\n\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u03a92 v2 (t) + f2 (t) , \u03a92 =\n\n(39)\n\u03a9\u20202 .\n\nThe system (39) allows one to single out states v1 which can be excited by the variables\nv2 , which constitute subspace H1c , namely\nH1c = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) and, consequently, H1d = H1 \u2296 H1c .\n\n(40)\n\nBased on this representation we deduce a condition that implies the existence of\ndecoupled states H1d in the presence of high symmetry in the internal dynamics in\nH1 (corresponding to high multiplicity of \u03a91 ):\nmult(\u03a91\u21beH1c ) \u2264 rank \u0393,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere mult {*} and rank {*} are the spectral multiplicity and the rank of an operator.\nWe prove this inequality later on in Theorem 15. If \u03a91 and \u0393 are generic, the inequality\n(41) would also be necessary for the existence of decoupled states. We will refer to\nthe condition (41) as the spectral multiplicity condition. This condition (41) readily\nimplies that an open system with low rank coupling and large spectral multiplicity\nmust have decoupled (frozen) states.\nBelow we construct a couple of simple examples of Hamiltonian open systems\nhaving decoupled degrees of freedom. A detailed discussion with theorems on the\ncoupled and decoupled parts of the state variables is presented in Section 4.\n\n3.1\n\nAn oscillatory system with frozen degress of freedom\n\nLet us consider an open oscillatory Hamiltonian system S1 described by momentum\nand coordinate variables {p, q} with p, q \u2208 RN , where N is finite natural number.\nHence, the Hilbert space of observable variables here is H1 = R2N . We assume this\nopen system to be a part of a larger Hamiltonian system for which the complimentary\nsystem S2 of hidden degrees of freedom is described by variables {\u03c0, \u03c6} with \u03c0, \u03c6 \u2208 G,\nwhere G is a real Hilbert space, and, hence, H2 = G \u2295 G. We don't write it explicitly,\nbut rather presume that the system evolves according to the Hamilton equations with\nthe total Hamiltonian to be of the form\nH (p, q; \u03c0, \u03c6) = h1 (p, q) + h2 (\u03c0, \u03c6) + hint (q, \u03c6)\n\n15\n\n(42)\n\n\fwhere h1 and h2 are correspondingly the internal energies of systems S1 and S2 , and\nhint is the interaction energy between S1 and S2 . We assume h1 and hint to be of the\nform\nJ\nX\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001\u00032\n(p, p) \u03be (q, q)\nh1 (p, q) =\nq, \u03b3 1j \u2212 \u03c6, \u03b3 2j\n+\n, hint (q, \u03c6) =\n(43)\n2m\n2\nj=1\n\nwhere m and \u03be are postive constants, 1 \u2264 J < N, \u03b3 1j \u2208 RN and \u03b3 2j \u2208 G. Evidently\nwe can always choose an orthonormal system of vectors {\u1ebd1 , . . . , \u1ebdN } in RN so that\nE\u03b3 = span {\u03b3 11 , . . . , \u03b3 1J } = span {\u1ebdN \u2212J+1 , . . . , \u1ebdN } ,\n\n(44)\n\nand introduce the corresponding new variables p\u0303, q\u0303 \u2208 RN by\nq=\n\nN\nX\ns=1\n\nqs es =\n\nN\nX\ns=1\n\nq\u0303s \u1ebds where {e1 , . . . , eN } is the standard basis in RN .\n\n(45)\n\nNext we introduce an orthogonal decomposition\np\u0303 = p\u0303\u2032 \u2295 p\u0303\u2032\u2032 , q\u0303 = q\u0303 \u2032 \u2295 q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 , where p\u0303\u2032\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 E\u03b3 and p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032 \u2208 RN \u2296 E\u03b3 ,\n\n(46)\n\nand recast the energies in (43) as follows\nh1 (p, q) = h\u20321 (p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032 ) + h\u2032\u20321 (p\u0303\u2032\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 ) , where\n(p\u0303\u2032\u2032 , p\u0303\u2032\u2032 ) \u03be (q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 )\n(p\u0303\u2032 , p\u0303\u2032 ) \u03be (q\u0303 \u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032 ) \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n+\n, h1 (p\u0303 , q\u0303 ) =\n+\n,\nh\u20321 (p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032) =\n2m\n2\n2m\n2\nJ\nX\n\u0001\u00032\n\u0001\n\u0002 \u2032\u2032\n.\nhint (q, \u03c6) =\nq\u0303 , \u03b3\u0303 1j \u2212 \u03c6, \u03b3 2j\n\n(47)\n\nj=1\n\nIt is evident from (47) that the variables {p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032 } are decoupled from the system S2 ,\nand all the coupling from S1 to S2 is only through the variables {p\u0303\u2032\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 }. In fact,\nS1 couples directly to S2 through the variables q\u0303 \u2032\u2032 only, but this coupling affects\np\u0303\u2032\u2032 through the internal dynamics in S1 . {p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032 } remain, however, unaffected. This\ntogether with (46) yields the following estimates for the space H1d of \"decoupled\"\nstates {p\u0303\u2032 , q\u0303 \u2032}.\n\u00012\nH1d \u2287 RN \u2296 E\u03b3 , and, hence, dim H1d \u2265 2 (N \u2212 J) .\n(48)\nAn elementary analysis of the used arguments shows that the existence of decoupled\nvariables in the above example is due to (i) the highly symmetric form of the Hamiltonaian h1 (p, q) in (43), resulting in the maximal spectral multiplicity N, and (ii) the\ncoupling of rank J, which is less than N and application of the spectral multiplicity\ncondition (41).\n16\n\n\fNotice that, if instead of (43), we would have\nN\nN\nX\nX\n\u03be s qs2\np2s\n+\nh1 (p, q) =\n2ms s=1 2\ns=1\n\n(49)\n\nwith all different and generic ms and \u03be s , then the corresponding spectral multiplicity\nwould be one and there will be no decoupled degrees of freedom. We point out also\nthat, in this case, for a generic \u03b3 1j in the representation (43) every vector from the\noriginal orthonormal system e1 , . . . , eN in RN has nonzero projections onto both E\u03b3\nand RN \u2296 E\u03b3 , implying that generically none of the original variables {ps , qs } can be\nconsidered as being decoupled from the system S2 . This indicates that decoupling of\nvariables due the spectral multiplicity, though elementary, is not trivial.\n\n3.2\n\nToy model of a solid with frozen degrees of freedom\n\nWe construct here a toy model for a solid having frozen degrees of freedom due to\nhigh spectral multiplicity, naturally arising from system symmetries. Let us consider\nthe d-dimensional lattice\nZd = {n : n = (n1 , . . . , nd ) , nj \u2208 Z} where Z is the set of integers,\n\n(50)\n\nand introduce a system S as a lattice array of identical oscillatory systems similar to\nthat described\bin the previous section. Namely, we assume that the system state is of\nthe form u = [pn , qn ] , n \u2208 Zd where with pn , qn \u2208 RN , where N is a finite natural\nnumber.\nThe system Hamiltonian H (p, q) is assumed to be spatially homogeneous, local,\nand of the form\n#\n\"\nJ\nX\nX\n(51)\nH (p, q) =\nh1 (pn , qn ) +\nk(\u2207qn , \u03b3 j )k2 , p, q \u2208 H,\nj=1\n\nn\u2208Zd\n\nwhere the local Hamiltonian h1 (p, q) is defined by (43), and the vectors \u03b3 j \u2208 RN ,\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 J, describe the interactions between neighboring sites through the discrete\ngradient \u2207. An expansion of the inner sum gives\nJ\nX\nj=1\n\n2\n\nk\u2207n (qn , \u03b3 j )k =\n\nJ X\nd\nX\nj=1 i=1\n\n(qn , \u03b3 j ) \u2212 (qn+ei , \u03b3 j )\n\n\u00012\n\n,\n\n(52)\n\nin which ei = (\u03b4i1 , . . . , \u03b4in ). Now denoting\n|m|0 = max |mj | , m = (m1 , . . . , md ) \u2208 Zd\n1\u2264j\u2264d\n\n17\n\n(53)\n\n\fwe consider an arbitrary finite lattice cube\n\b\n\u039b = \u039bL = n \u2208 Zd : |n|0 \u2264 L where L \u2265 2 is an integer,\n\n(54)\n\nand define its volume |\u039b| by\n\n|\u039b| = number of sites n \u2208 \u039b.\n\n(55)\n\nNow we introduce a system S\u039b associated with the finite lattice cube \u03bb, in which the\nstates are functions from \u039b to RN \u2295 RN , or {[pn , qn ] , n \u2208 \u039b}, with the Hamiltonian\n#\n\"\nJ0\nX\nX\n/ \u039b.\n(56)\nH\u039b (p, q) =\nh1 (pn , qn ) +\nk\u2207qn , \u03b3 j k2 ; qn = 0 for n \u2208\nn\u2208\u039b\n\nj=1\n\nRecall now that the system dynamics is described then by the Hamilton equations\ndp\ndH dq\ndH\n=\u2212\n,\n=\n,\ndt\ndq dt\ndp\n\n(57)\n\nwhich, in our case, turns into the linear evolution equation of the form\ndu\n= \u2212i\u03a9u, u = [p, q]\ndt\n\n(58)\n\nin which multiplication by i is defined by i[p, q] = [\u2212q, p]. Without writing the relevant\noperator (matrix) \u03a9 explicitly, we simply denote by \u03a9\u039b the respective matrix for the\nHamiltonian H\u039b . Observe now that in view of the form (56) of the Hamiltonian H\u039b ,\nan open oscillatory system associated with any single site n \u2208 \u039b is exactly of the\nform considered in the previous section (see (51) and (52)), and, consequently, it has\n\u00012\ndecoupled degrees of freedom described by the space RN \u2296 E\u03b3 not depending on\nn. This implies that the space of decoupled (frozen) states Hd satisfies\n\u00012|\u039b|\nHd \u2287 RN \u2296 E\u03b3\n.\n(59)\nIf we put H = H1d \u2295 H1c , then this, combined with the fact the local Hamiltonians\n(h1 ) at all sites are identical gives the rank of the coupling as J|\u039b|. By the spectral\nmultiplicity condition (41) we then obtain a bound on the spectral multiplicity of the\nrestriction \u03a9\u039b\u21beHc to the \"coupled\" part Hc :\nmult(\u03a9\u039b\u21beHc ) \u2264 J |\u039b| = J (2L + 1)d .\n\n(60)\n\nIn fact, a more eleborate analysis based on introduction of lattice toruses along with\nlattice cubes can produce an approximate formlula of the following form\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nmult \u03a9\u039b\n(61)\n= C0 + O |\u039b|\u2212 d ,\n|\u039b|\n18\n\n\fwhere C0 is a constant similar to J.\nThe estimates (60) and (61) for the solid toy model indicate that the high spectral\nmultiplicity can cause many degrees of freedom to be comletilely decoupled from the\nrest of the system.\n\n4\n\nReconstructibility from open subsystems\n\nAccording to our general strategy, we regard an open system within its conservative\nsystem from two points of view that are closely related. In the first, we consider\na conservative system composed of two coupled subsystems, each treated equally.\nBecause of the coupling, the subsystems are open, and we analyze the extent to\nwhich the conservative system is reconstructible from either of its open subsystems.\nIn the second, the objects that play the leading role are the \"master\" conservative\nsystem and a given subsystem. The subsystem is open, as it interchanges energy with\nthe master system.\n\n4.1\n\nTwo coupled open systems\n\nWe first investigate a conservative system composed of two coupled open ones. Typically, one system will be observable, such as a resonator, and the other will represent\nits \"exterior\" which we associate with the hidden degrees of freedom.\nLet us begin with two conservative systems, Closed System 1, identified by the\ntriple (H1 , m1 , A1 ) that represents an observable system\nm1 \u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212iA1 v1 (t) + f1 (t) in H1\n\n(62)\n\nsatisfying the rest condition (Condition 2, page 8), and another linear system, Closed\nSystem 2, identified by the triple (H2 , m2 , \u03a92 ) that represents the system of hidden\nvariables\nm2 \u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212iA2 v2 (t) + f2 (t) in H2\n(63)\nalso satisfying the rest condition. A1 and A2 are self-adjoint, and the mass operators\nm1 and m2 are positive. We then couple the two systems through a bounded operator\n\u0393 and its adjoint:\n\u0393 : H2 \u2192 H1 ,\n\u0393\u2020 : H 1 \u2192 H 2 .\n(64)\nThe conservative system as composed of these two subsystems then has the form\nm1 \u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212iA1 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) + f1 (t) ,\n\u2020\n\nm2 \u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393 v1 (t) \u2212 iA2 v2 (t) + f2 (t) .\n19\n\n(65)\n\n\fUsing the following rescaling transformation\n\u22121\n\n1\n\nvj \u2192 mj 2 vj ,\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAj \u2192 mj 2 \u03a9j mj 2 ,\n\nfj \u2192 mj 2 fj ,\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u0393 \u2192 m12 \u0393m22\n\n(66)\n\nwe recast the system (65) into the simpler form\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) + f1 (t) ,\n\n(67)\n\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393\u2020 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u03a92 v2 (t) + f2 (t) ,\nwhich we will use from now on. We refer to the operators \u03a91 and \u03a92 as the frequency\noperators for the observable and hidden systems.\nIn matrix form, the system (67) is written as\n\u2202t V = \u2212i\u03a9 V + F ,\n\nV, F \u2208 H = H1 \u2295 H2 ,\n\nin which the frequency operator \u03a9 has the block-matrix structure\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03a91 \u0393\n.\n\u03a9=\n\u0393\u2020 \u03a92\n\n(68)\n\n(69)\n\nBecause of the coupling, both systems become open. Their dynamics are obtained\nby projecting the dynamics of the large conservative system in H to H1 and H2\nseparately. For System 1, this means setting the forcing from the second equation\nof the system (67) to zero (f2 (t) = 0), solving for v2 , and then inserting the result\ninto the first equation. This, together with an analogous computation for System 2,\nresults in the dynamical equations for the open systems Open System 1 (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t))\nand Open System 2 (H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)):\nZ \u221e\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212\na1 (\u03c4 )v1 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f1 (t) in H1 ,\n(70)\nZ0 \u221e\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u03a92 v2 (t) \u2212\na2 (\u03c4 )v2 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f2 (t) in H2 ,\n(71)\n0\n\nin which\na1 (t) = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020\n\nand a2 (t) = \u0393\u2020 e\u2212i\u03a91 t \u0393,\n\n(72)\n\nand the functions aj (t) are the friction functions. The rest condition, Condition 2\ncontinues to hold, and, by virtue of their form, the equations automatically satisfy\nthe power dissipation condition, Condition 1.\nWe ask the question: How much of H2 can be reconstructed from Open System\n1 (70) alone; in other words, how much information about the hidden variables is\nencoded in the friction function a1 (t) for the observable variables? We can view\na1 (t) as a dynamical mechanism by which an observer confined to the observable\n20\n\n\fstate variables detects or influences the hidden degrees of freedom. The subspace of\nH2 that is reconstructible by a1 (t) we call the coupled component of H2 and denote\nit by H2c . Clearly this subspace is determined by the coupling channels to H2 given\nby \u0393\u2020 and the internal action by \u03a92 on H2 ; this is explicitly evident in the form\na1 (t) = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 .\nThe question of the extent to which the observable system determines the hidden is\ntantamount to that of determining the unique minimal conservative extension of Open\nSystem 1 within the large system (H, \u03a9) (see Section 2). According to Proposition 3\nthe Hilbert state space Hmin \u2283 H1 of this conservative extension is simply the orbit\n(see Definition 5) of H1 under the action of \u03a9, as a subspace of H:\nHmin = O\u03a9 (H1 ) = H1 \u2295 H2c ,\n\nH2c := Hmin \u2296 H1 .\n\n(73)\n\nIn addition, it can be shown that H2c \u2286 H2 is invariant under the action of \u03a92 , namely\n\u03a92 H2c \u2286 H2c \u2286 H2 ,\n\n(74)\n\nand we refer to H2c as the coupled component of H2 . This construction of H2c \u2286 H2\ngives rise to a canonical \u03a92 -invariant orthogonal decomposition of the hidden state\nvariables,\nH2 = H2c \u2295 H2d .\n(75)\nWe refer to the subspace H2d defined in (75) as the decoupled component of H2 . The\nsystems in H2c and H2d evolve independently in time by the internal dynamics \u03a92\nof the hidden variables H2 . Furthermore, since it can be shown that the operator\nrange Ran(\u0393\u2020 ) \u2282 H2c , we see that no forcing function from H2d can influence the\ndynamics of the observable variables and, in turn, does not influence the dynamics of\nH2c through the coupling.\nIn an analogous way, we can ask, how much of H1 can a hypothetical observer\nconfined to H2 reconstruct? The component H1c of H1 that is reconstructible by\nan observer in the hidden state variables we call the coupled component of H1 . Its\northogonal complement H1d is the decoupled component of H1 , and we have the decomposition\nH1 = H1c \u2295 H1d ,\n(76)\nwhich is invariant under the action of \u03a91 . The state space of the unique minimal\nconservative extension of Open System 2 is H1c \u2295 H2 .\nWith respect to these decompositions of the observable and hidden variables into\nthe coupled and decoupled components H = H1d \u2295 H1c \u2295 H2c \u2295 H2d , the frequency\n\n21\n\n\foperator \u03a9 for the conservative system\n\uf8ee\n\u03a91d\n\uf8ef 0\n\u03a9=\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0\n0\n\n(67) has the matrix form\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n0\n\u03a91c \u0393c\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\u0393\u2020c \u03a92c 0 \uf8fb\n0\n0 \u03a92d\n\n(77)\n\nin which the subscripts refer to retrictions of the domain:\n\u03a9ic = \u03a9\u21beHic ,\n\n\u03a9id = \u03a9\u21beHid ,\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\nand \u0393c = \u0393\u21beH2c .\n\n(78)\n\nWe can see from (77) that the decoupled parts H1d and H2d , can be analyzed independently of the rest of the system justifying their name \"decoupled\".

This is equivalent to the\nstatement that (H1c \u2295 H2c , \u03a9c ) is the unique minimal conservative extension, realized\nas a subsystem of (H, \u03a9), of each of its open components separately. This motivates\nthe following definition.\nDefinition 8 (reconstructibility) A conservative linear system composed of two\ncoupled subsystems\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) + f1 (t),\n\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393\u2020 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u03a92 v2 (t) + f2 (t),\n\nwith v1 (t) \u2208 H1 and v2 (t) \u2208 H2 is called reconstructible if it is the minimal conservative extension of each of the open projected linear systems\nZ \u221e\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212\n\u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 \u03c4 \u0393\u2020 v1 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f1 (t)\nin H1 ,\nZ0 \u221e\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u03a92 v2 (t) \u2212\n\u0393\u2020 e\u2212i\u03a91 \u03c4 \u0393 v2 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f2 (t)\nin H2 .\n0\n\nIn other words, the conservative system (H1 \u2295 H2 , \u03a9) (\u03a9 is defined by its decomposition (69)) is reconstructible if all of H2 can be reconstructed from the open system\n(H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) and all of H1 can be reconstructed from the open system (H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)).\nWe say that H2 is reconstructible from the open system (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) if H1 \u2295H2 is\n(isomorphic to) the state space for the minimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)).\n22\n\n\fA conservative system that is reconstructible may possibly be further decomposed\ninto independent conservative subsystems that commute with the projection to H1 ,\nin other words, that are of the form H1\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032 with H1\u2032 \u2286 H1 and H2\u2032 \u2286 H2 . However, H1\u2032 will not contain the entire range of \u0393 and accordingly will not contain all\nof the information of the delayed response function a1 (t). We take up these finer\ndecompositions further in Section 5.\nThe simplest reconstructibility theorem is as follows. More general reconstructibility statements as well as the proofs are given in Section 6.\nTheorem 9 (system reconstructibility) Let a conservative \"master\" system composed of two coupled systems be given:\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u0393v2 (t) + f1 (t),\n\u2020\n\n\u2202t v2 (t) = \u2212i\u0393 v1 (t) \u2212 i\u03a92 v2 (t) + f2 (t),\n\n(80)\n(81)\n\nwith v1 (t) in the state space H1 and v2 (t) in the state space H2 , and let the coupling\noperator \u0393 : H2 \u2192 H1 be bounded. Let also H2c denote the subspace of H2 that is\nreconstructible from Open System 1 and H1c the subspace of H1 that is reconstructible\nfrom Open System 2.\ni. H1c consists of the set of states of H1 that are accessible by applying the internal\ndynamics of H1 (given by \u03a91 ) to all vectors in H1 to which H2 is directly coupled\nby \u0393, that is,\nH1c = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393).\n(82)\nSimilarly,\n\nH2c = O\u03a92 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ).\n\n(83)\n\nii. The restriction of the master system to H1 \u2295 H2c is the unique minimal conservative extension of H1 , and the restriction to H1c \u2295 H2 is the unique minimal\nconservative extension of H2 .\niii. The restriction of the master system to H1c \u2295 H2c is the unique reconstructible\nsubsystem of the master system that completely determines the friction functions\nof Open Systems 1 and 2, namely \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 and \u0393\u2020 e\u2212i\u03a91 t \u0393.\niv. (H1 \u2295H2 , \u03a9) is reconstructible if and only if H1 and H2 have no nontrivial \u03a9invariant subspaces.\nExample: two coupled finite systems. With a simple finite-dimensional\nexample of two coupled open systems, we illustrate the interaction between the two\ncomponents and the extent to which each is determined, or reconstructible, by the\nother.

This range, which is the range of \u0393, happens to be\nan eigenspace for \u03a91 corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb1 (equation 85). The delayedresponse function for the reduced dynamics in H2 therefore only involves this single\nfrequency:\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u03b3 \u0002 \u2217 \u2217 \u0003 i\u03bb1 t\n\u03b3 \u03b4 e .\n(90)\na2 (t) =\n\u03b4\n\nThe state space of the minimal conservative extension of (H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)) is the threedimensional space\nH1c \u2295 H2 ,\n(91)\n24\n\n\fin which H1c is the \"coupled component\" of H1 , consisting of the eigenspace for the\neigenvalue \u03bb1 .\nIf one projects the dynamics to H1c , then its minimal conservative extension is the\nsame as that of (H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)). Thus, the space H2 , as well as its internal dynamics\noperator \u03a92 and the coupling \u0393, are reconstructible from the dynamics projected to\nH1c , just as H1c , \u03a91 restricted to H1c , and \u0393 are reconstructible from (H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)).\nWe therefore call the system in H1c \u2295 H2 reconstructible (Definition 8).\nIn Theorem 9, we prove that a coupled pair of open systems forming a conservative system, H1 \u2295 H2 admits a unique reconstructible subsystem system H1c \u2295 H2c ,\ncontaining all the information of a1 (t), in which the projection of the dynamics to\neach part is sufficient to reconstruct the other. As in the simple example of this\nsubsection, it is always true that H1c is the \u03a91 -orbit of Ran \u0393 and H2c is the \u03a92 -orbit\nof Ran \u0393\u2020 .\n\n4.2\n\nOpen subsystems of conservative systems\n\nOften an open system arises as a part of a given conservative system (H, \u03a9) projected\nonto an observable subspace H1 \u2282 H. We investigate the way in which the state space\nHmin of the minimal conservative extension of the open system in H1 is reconstructed\nwithin the spectral structure of (H, \u03a9). We shall see that Hmin is generated by the\nprojections of all vectors in H1 onto the eigenspaces of \u03a9, as well as by the projections,\nonto the eigenspaces of \u03a9, of those vectors in H1 and H \u2296 H1 that are directly coupled\nthrough \u0393 (the ranges of \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 ). We discuss both points of view. We investigate\nsimilar constructions for the generation of H1c and H2c by eigenmodes of \u03a91 and\n\u03a92 and arrive at one of our main results, Theorem 15, which bounds the number of\nextending strings by the rank of the coupling.\nIn the case, say, of a finite resonator embedded within an infinite planar lattice, for\nwhich the multiplicity of each eigenvalue is infinite, this result has immediate consequences: namely, the multiplicities of the eigenfrequencies for the minimal extension\n(Hmin , \u03a9\u21beHmin ) are uniformly bounded and hence Hmin is but a very small part of H.\nThe perhaps more interesting point of view, in which the directly coupled modes (the\nranges of \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 ) generate Hmin , has special significance for an object in surface\ncontact with an infinite medium.\n4.2.1 Generating the minimal extension from the observable states. Not\nsurprisingly, all of the modes (eigenfunctions) of the frequency operator \u03a9 that contribute to the \u03a9-mode decomposition of any one of the vectors in the \"observable\"\nspace H1 must be included as states of the minimal extension. These modes, in turn,\ngenerate all of the observable vectors, and therefore the entire space Hmin .\nTo understand this, let us begin with the case in which H is finite dimensional.\nLet {\u03bb\u03b1 }n\u03b1=1 be the distinct eigenvalues of \u03a9. We then have a decomposition of H\n25\n\n\finto orthogonal eigenspaces\nH=\n\nn\nM\n\u03b1=1\n\nH\u03b1 ,\n\n(92)\n\nwith respect to which the operator \u03a9 is diagonal:\nfor each v =\n\nn\nX\n\nv\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03a9v =\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 v\u03b1 .\n\n(93)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nAs we have discussed, Hmin is the subspace of H that is generated by the vectors\nin H1 through the operator \u03a9, in other words, it is the orbit O\u03a9 (H1 ) of H1 under\n\u03a9. In the finite-dimensional case, this is simply the vector space spanned by the\nvectors \u03a9k (v) for v \u2208 H1 and 0 \u2264 k < n. Since the monomials \u03bbk , restricted to\nthe spectrum of \u03a9, span the space of functions defined on the spectrum, we have\nv\u03b1 \u2208 Hmin for each \u03b1 = 1, . . . , n. Now since the vector v \u2208 H1 is in turn generated\nthrough linear combination by its projections v\u03b1 , we conclude that Hmin is generated\nby the projections of H1 onto the eigenspaces of \u03a9, denoted by \u03c0 \u03b1 (H1 ):\nHmin = O\u03a9 (H1 ) =\n\nn\nM\n\n\u03c0 \u03b1 (H1 ).\n\n(94)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThus we have a spectral decomposition for (Hmin , \u03a9 \u21be Hmin ) explicitly in terms of\nsubspaces of the eigenspaces for (H, \u03a9).\nThis result can be extended to the case in which H is infinite-dimensional and\n\u03a9 has pure point spectrum, say {\u03bb\u03b1 }\u221e\n\u03b1=1 (Theorem 13). In this case, the class of\npolynomial functions p of the operator \u03a9 of degree less than n, which was sufficient for\nthe finite-dimensional case, must be expanded to include all continuous functions f (\u03a9)\nas understood in the classical functional calculus. Applying all continuous functions\nof \u03a9 to all vectors in H1 and taking the closure gives the orbit O\u03a9 (H1 ), and the\nprojections \u03c0\u03b1 (H1 ) onto the eigenspaces are contained in this orbit. We obtain again\nthe spectral decomposition (94), in which n = \u221e.\nA typical frequency operator \u03a9 for a conservative dynamical system does not have\npure point spectrum, and we now face the problem of extending this construction of\nHmin to the case of general spectrum. The fairly simple construction of Hmin we have\ndiscussed for pure point spectrum provides us with the correct principle:\nRule 10 (extension by modes of \u03a9 via observable variables) The minimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a9\u21beH1 , a1 (t)) is generated by linear superposition, within\nthe given master system (H, \u03a9), by all of the modes that appear in the eigenmode\ndecomposition, into eigenmodes of \u03a9, of any of the states of H1 .\n26\n\n\fWhen \u03a9 has continuous spectrum, its modes are no longer finite-norm (finiteenergy) states-they no longer exist as elements of the Hilbert space H. In this case,\nit one can replace the projections \u03c0 \u03b1 (H1 ) of H1 to the eigenspaces of \u03a9 with a set of\nspectral projections associated with \u03a9:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n\u03c0(H1 ) : \u03c0 =\ndE\u03bb for some interval \u2206 of R ,\n(95)\n\u2206\n\nin which dE\u03bb is the spectral resolution of the identity associated with \u03a9. This set\ngenerates Hmin by linear combination and closure. Of course, the spaces \u03c0(H1 ) are in\ngeneral no longer orthogonal to each other for two different choices of the projection \u03c0,\nso we no longer have an orthogonal decomposition as in equation (94). The projections\ncan be localized to include only spectral intervals of length \u01eb for arbitrarily small \u01eb, so\nthat one approaches spectrally localized projections, nearly representing eigenmode\nspaces, as \u01eb \u2192 0. However, the projections no longer make sense for \u01eb = 0 (unless the\nspectrum has no continuous part).\nFortunately, one need not abandon the use of modes\nP altogether when dealing with\ncontinuous spectra. Just as the Laplace operator \u2212 i \u2202xi xi has the extended states\nei\u03bbx for its modes, which generate all sufficiently regular functions through integral\nsuperposition, a proper treatment of modes of \u03a9 and decomposition of states into\nthese modes is accomplished by a furnishing of H: H+ \u2282 H \u2282 H\u2212 . The modes lie\nin the larger Hilbert space H\u2212 , endowed with a smaller norm, with respect to which\nH is dense in H\u2212 . All elements of the smaller space H+ , which is dense in H, are\nrepresented as integral superpositions of the modes:\nZ\nv = \u03a8v (\u03bb)d\u03bc,\n(96)\nin which d\u03bc is a spectral measure for \u03a9, \u03a8 is a d\u03bc-measureable function with values\nin H\u2212 , and \u03a8(\u03bb) is a mode for \u03a9 for the frequency \u03bb. This means that h\u03a8(\u03bb)|\u03a9|vi =\n\u03bbh\u03a8(\u03bb)|vi whenever all of these objects are defined. See, for example, [8].\nWith this structure, each state v \u2208 H1 \u2229 H+ is decomposed into its modes \u03a8v (\u03bb),\nwhere \u03bb runs over all spectral values. Integral superpositions of these modes then\ngenerate Hmin :\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\n2\n\u03a8(\u03bb)d\u03bc : \u03a8 \u2208 L (R, H\u2212 , d\u03bc), \u2200\u03bb \u2208 R \u2203v \u2208 H1 , \u03a8(\u03bb) = \u03a8v (\u03bb) . (97)\nHmin =\nA rigorous treatment of generalized modes is quite technical; we do not pursue it in\nthis work but leave it for a forthcoming work in which we treat unbounded coupling.\n4.2.2 Generating the conservative extension from the coupling channels.\nThe role of the coupling operator \u0393 and the space of hidden variables H \u2296 H1 is not\n27\n\n\femphasized in the construction of Hmin from H1 by the action of \u03a9. We shall now\nshow an alternative way to generate Hmin , provided H1 = H1c , that is, provided that\nH1 has no \u03a9-invariant subspaces. This is by the action of \u03a9 on Ran \u0393 and Ran \u0393\u2020 , or\nby the action of \u03a9 on the coupling channels (see definition 6).\nWe shall see that the minimal reconstructible system described in Theorem 9 is\nobtained by linear superposition of the projections of the ranges of \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 onto the\neigenspaces of \u03a9. This can also be expressed as linear superposition of those modes\nof \u03a9 that are present in the mode decompositions of all vectors in Ran \u0393 and Ran \u0393\u2020 .\nTo understand why this is true, let us decompose \u03a9 into a diagonal part representing the internal dynamics of the observable and hidden variables and a part\nrepresenting the coupling:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03a91 0\n0 \u0393\n\u03a9 = \u03a9\u030a + \u0393\u030a, \u03a9\u030a =\n, \u0393\u030a =\n.\n(98)\n0 \u03a92\n\u0393\u2020 0\nSince Ran \u0393\u030a is contained in O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) and \u03a9 = \u03a9\u030a + \u0393\u030a, the operator \u03a9 generating\nthe orbit can be replaced by \u03a9\u030a: Recalling the definition of the orbit of a subset of a\nHilbert space under the action of two operators (22), we obtain\nO\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9,\u0393\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9\u030a,\u0393\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a).\n\n(99)\n\nNow, by the decoupling of the action of \u03a9\u030a with respect to the decomposition H1 \u2295 H2\nand the splitting Ran \u0393\u030a = Ran \u0393 \u2295 Ran \u0393\u2020 , we obtain a simple characterization of this\norbit:\nO\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393) \u2295 O\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393\u2020 ) = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) \u2295 O\u03a92 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ).\n\n(100)\n\nAssuming that H1 = H1c , or, equivalently, that H1 has no nontrivial \u03a9-invariant\nsubspace (see Theorem 9, part (i )), we obtain\nHmin = O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a).\n\n(101)\n\nWe may now adapt our previous discussion concerning the construction of Hmin\nfrom H1 in order to understand the construction of Hmin from Ran \u0393\u030a within the\nspectral structure of (H, \u03a9) simply be replacing H1 in the arguments with Ran \u0393\u030a.\nRule 11 (extension by modes of \u03a9 via coupling channels) If H1 contains no\n\u03a9-invariant subspace, then the minimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a9\u21beH1 , a1 (t)) is\ngenerated by linear superposition, within the given master system (H, \u03a9), by all of the\nmodes that appear in the eigenmode decomposition, into eigenmodes of \u03a9, of any of\nthe states in the ranges of \u0393 and \u0393\u2020 .\n28\n\n\fThe representations (94) and (97) with Ran \u0393\u030a replacing H1 are valid for the pure\npoint and general cases, repectively. In the case of pure point spectrum, in particular for finite systems, we can reformulate Rule 11 in terms of a characterization of\nreconstructiblity:\n(H = H1 \u2295 H2 , \u03a9) is reconstructible if and only if, on each mode of \u03a9, \u0393\u030a does\nnot vanish.\n4.2.4 Generating H1 and H2 from \u0393. These rules can be applied as well to\nthe two components of the reconstructible system (H\u2032 = H1c \u2295 H2c , \u03a9\u21beH\u2032) from the\noperators of their internal dynamics, \u03a91 and \u03a92 . Recall from part (i ) of Theorem 9\nthat the \"coupled\" part H1c of H1 is generated through the action of the frequency\noperator \u03a91 on the range of \u0393. We obtain therefore, by the same reasoning as before,\nresults on the construction of H1c by superposition of the modes of \u03a91 obtained from\nthe projections of Ran \u0393 onto the eigenspaces of \u03a91 . Of course, this applies equally\nto the construction of H2c by modes of \u03a92 .\nRule 12 (Generating H1c and H2c ) The \"coupled\" part Hic of Hi is generated by\nlinear superposition, within the system (Hi , \u03a9i ), by all of the modes that appear in the\neigenmode decomposition, into modes of \u03a9i , of any of the states in Ran \u0393 (i = 1) or\nRan \u0393\u2020 (i = 2).\nIn the case of pure point spectrum,\nH1c = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) =\n\nn\nM\n\nH2c = O\u03a92 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ) =\n\nm\nM\n\n\u03c0 1\u03b1 (Ran \u0393),\n\n(102)\n\n\u03c0 2\u03b1 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ),\n\n(103)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nin which \u03c0 1\u03b1 and \u03c0 2\u03b1 are projections onto the eigenspaces of \u03a91 in H1 and \u03a92 in\nH2 , respectively. If \u03a9i has continuous spectrum, then, as in our previous discussion,\nwe may replace projections onto the eigenspaces by general spectral projections, that\nis, those projections that commute with \u03a9i (see (95)). The discussion of generalized\nmodes and a construction of the form (97) for Hic is also applicable.\n4.2.5 Summary and theorem. The results of the discussion are collected in the\nfollowing theorem and proved in Section 6 (see the proof of Theorem 14).\nWe have made the statement about decomposition into modes rigorous in part (i )\nof the theorem for the case of pure point spectrum, in which the modes are genuine\nelements of H; a weaker rigorous statement in which the modes are replaced by\narbitrary spectral projections, is given for general spectrum in part (ii ).\n29\n\n\fTheorem 15 is one of our main results; it summarizes our conclusions about bounding the multiplicity of the frequency operators \u03a9\u21beHmin and \u03a9ic = \u03a9i\u21beHic by the rank\nof \u0393. In particular, the result for \u03a92c states that the number of strings needed to\nconstruct the minimal extension is bounded by the number of coupling channels.\nTheorem 13 (spectral representation of the minimal extension) Let a conservative system (H, \u03a9) be given, and let (Hmin \u2282 H, \u03a9\u21be Hmin ) be the minimal conservative extension of the open system (H1 , \u03a9\u21beH1 , a1 (t)) obtained by projecting the\ndynamics of (H, \u03a9) onto the subspace H1 \u2282 H. The coupling operator \u0393 is assumed\nto be bounded. (By the \"projection\" of a subset of a Hilbert space onto a subspace, we\nrefer to the image of the orthogonal projection operator in the Hilbert space onto the\nsubspace.)\ni.

In fact, (H = H1 \u2295 H2 , \u03a9) is\nreconstructible if and only if \u0393\u030a(\u03c6) 6= 0 for each eigenmode \u03c6 of \u03a9.\n30\n\n\fTheorem 14 (spectral representation of the hidden variables) Let the hypotheses of Theorem 13 continue to hold.\ni.

It is one of our main\nresults, which we have alluded to in the introduction and in the construction of the\ntoy model of a solid with frozen degrees of freedom in Section 3. The second part\nshows that the rank of the coupling operator bounds the number of extending strings\nneeded in the minimal conservative extension of an open system.\nTheorem 15 (bound on number of strings)\ni. The multiplicity of each spectral value \u03bb of \u03a9 \u21be Hmin is bounded above by the\ndimension of H1 and, if H1c = H1 , by twice the rank of \u0393:\nmultiplicity (\u03bb) \u2264 min{dim(H1 ), 2 rank (\u0393)}.\n\n(110)\n\nii. The multiplicity of each spectral value \u03bb of \u03a9i\u21beHic is bounded above by the rank\nof \u0393:\nmultiplicity (\u03bb) \u2264 rank (\u0393).\n(111)\nFor i = 2, this states that the number of abstract strings needed to extend\n(H1 , \u03a9 \u21be H1 , a1 (t)) minimally to a conservative system is no greater than the\nnumber of coupling channels between H1 and H2 .\n31\n\n\f5\n\nDecomposition of coupled systems\n\nIt can happen that a given open system splits into two or more smaller independent subsystems, that are decoupled from each other, leading to a natural simplifying\ndecomposition. But, depending on the choice of coordinates, such a natural decomposition may not be evident right away. We ask then if there is a systematic way to\nfind such a decomposition. In this section we intend to answer this question, at least\nunder tractable conditions; the most general conditions are treated in Section 6.\nLet us return to our observable open system:\nZ \u221e\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212\na1 (\u03c4 )v1 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f1 (t) in H1 ,\n(112)\n0\n\nand suppose that there is a subspace of observable variables H1\u2032 \u2282 H1 such that\nan observer confined to this subspace experiences no influence from the rest of the\nobservable space, that is, H1\u2032 is decoupled from H1\u2032\u2032 = H1 \u2296 H1\u2032 under the dynamics\nof (112). More precisely, let \u03c0\u20321 be the orthogonal projection onto H1\u2032 in H1 and\n\u03c0 \u2032\u20321 = IH1 \u2212\u03c0 \u20321 the projection onto H1\u2032\u2032 , and let v1\u2032 (t) = \u03c0 \u20321 v1 (t) and f1\u2032 (t) = \u03c0 \u20321 f1 (t).\nThen the decoupling of H1\u2032 means that\n\u03c0 \u20321 \u03a91 \u03c0 \u2032\u20321 = 0\n\nand\n\n\u03c0\u20321 a1 (t)\u03c0 \u2032\u20321 = 0 for all t,\n\n(113)\n\nso that v \u2032 (t) satisfies a dynamical equation within H1\u2032 , with no input from H1\u2032\u2032 :\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212\na1 (\u03c4 )v1\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f1\u2032 (t) in H1\u2032 .\n(114)\n0\n\nThe question then arises: Does this imply the reciprocal condition that that H1\u2032\u2032\nevolves independently of H1\u2032 ? In other words, if H1\u2032 is not influenced by H1\u2032\u2032 , then\ndoes it follow that H1\u2032\u2032 is not influenced by H1\u2032 ? We shall prove that the answer is\naffirmative. This means that \u03c0 \u2032\u20321 a1 (t)\u03c0 \u20321 = 0 also, so that the splitting H1 = H1\u2032 \u2295 H1\u2032\u2032\nis preserved by a1 (t), for all t. In this case, we have a decoupling of the open system\n(112) into two independent open systems, so that\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2202t v1 (t) = \u2212i\u03a91 v1 (t) \u2212\na1 (\u03c4 )v1\u2032\u2032 (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4 + f1\u2032\u2032 (t) in H1\u2032\u2032\n(115)\n0\n\nalso holds.\nSuch decoupling of open systems is easy to understand from the point of view of\nthe minimal conservative extension (H, \u03a9) of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)). If (H\u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 ) and (H\u2032\u2032 , \u03a9\u2032\u2032 )\nare the minimal conservative extensions of the open systems in H1\u2032 and H1\u2032\u2032 , then\n(H := H\u2032 \u2295 H\u2032\u2032 , \u03a9 := \u03a9\u2032 \u2295 \u03a9\u2032\u2032 ) is the minimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)).\n32\n\n\fThe decoupling of the open system (112) is tantamount to the existence of a projection\nin its conservative extension H, namely the projection \u03c0 \u2032 onto H\u2032 , that commutes both\nwith \u03a9 as well as with the projection P1 onto H1 . This is the content of Theorem 17\n(and Theorem 21 in Section 6) below.\nThe structure of this decomposition and its implications for the decomposition\nof \u03a91 , \u03a92 , and \u0393 can be seen in a four-fold decomposition of (H, \u03a9). Denote by\nP2 = I \u2212 P1 the projection onto H2 and by \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 = I \u2212 \u03c0 \u2032 the projection onto H\u2032 . We\nnote that P1 and \u03c0 \u2032 commute if and only if H admits the (orthogonal) decomposition\nH = H1\u2032 \u2295 H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032\u2032,\n\n(116)\n\nwhere the components are, respectively, the images of the projections \u03c0 \u2032 P1 , \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 P1 ,\n\u03c0 \u2032 P2 , and \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 P2 . With respect to the decomposition (116), the operator \u03a9 has the\nform\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee \u2032\n\u03a91 0 \u0393\u2032 0\n\uf8ef 0 \u03a9\u2032\u20321 0 \u0393\u2032\u2032 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(117)\n\u03a9=\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u0393\u2032\u2020 0 \u03a9\u20322 0 \uf8fb ,\n0 \u0393\u2032\u2032\u2020 0 \u03a9\u2032\u20322\n\nin which the splittings H1 = H1\u2032 \u2295 H1\u2032\u2032 and H2 = H2\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032\u2032 simultaneously diagonalize\n\u03a91 , \u03a92 , and \u0393.\nThis type of system decoupling of a conservative extension (H, \u03a9) of a given open\nsystem (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) we call s-invariant (for system-invariant) with respect to H1 .\nDefinition 16 (s-invariant decomposition) Let a conservative system (H, \u03a9) be\ngiven, along with an open subsystem obtained by projecting the dynamics onto a subspace H1 \u2282 H, and let P1 , \u03a91 , \u03a92 , and \u0393 be defined as before. A decomposition\nH = H\u2032 \u2295 H\u2032\u2032 , with projection \u03c0 \u2032 onto H\u2032 , is called s-invariant with respect to H1 (or\nP1 ) if the following equivalent conditions hold:\ni. \u03c0 \u2032 commutes with \u03a9 and P1 ;\nii. H\u2032 (or, equivalently, H\u2032\u2032 ) is of the form H\u2032 = H1\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032 , where H1\u2032 \u2282 H1 and\nH2\u2032 \u2282 H2 , and H\u2032 is invariant under \u03a9 (O\u03a9 (H\u2032 ) = H\u2032 ).\nAn s-invariant decomposition of a conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) is understood to be s-invariant with respect to the subspace H1 .\nTheorem 17 (decoupling criterion) Let the open system (112) characterized by\nthe triple (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) be given, along with a subspace H1\u2032 \u2282 H1 . The following are\nequivalent:\n\n33\n\n\fi. The projected dynamics of the open system onto H1\u2032 is not influenced by the\ndynamics of H1 \u2296 H1\u2032 , that is, the dynamical equation (114) holds.\nii. The minimal conservative extension (H, \u03a9) of the open system admits an sinvariant splitting H = H\u2032 \u2295 H\u2032\u2032 such that H1\u2032 = H1 \u2229 H\u2032 , that is, the blockdiagonal form (117) for \u03a9 holds.\nNotice that part (ii) implies that a1 (t) is diagonal with respect to the decomposition H1 = H1\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032 so that both (114) and (115) hold. Therefore, by the theorem,\n(114) (or (115)) is equivalent to (114,115).\nTheorem 18 involves the relation between s-invariant decompositions of conservative systems and the singular values of the coupling operator. We begin with a\ntreatment of an arbitrary countable orthogonal decomposition of H1 and H2 that is\ninvariant under the internal actions given by \u03a91 and \u03a92 but does not necessarily\ncorrespond to an s-invariant decomposition:\nHi =\n\nni\nL\n\nHi\u03b1 ,\n\nni\nP\n\nI Hi =\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u03c0 i\u03b1 ,\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(118)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nwhere \u03c0 i\u03b1 , i = 1, 2, are the orthogonal projections onto the the subspaces Hi\u03b1 and\nthe ni are allowed to be \u221e.\nThe frequency and coupling operators split as follows:\n\u03a9i =\n\nni\nX\n\n\u03a9i\u03b1 ,\n\n(119)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u0393 = I H1 \u0393 I H2 =\n\nn1 X\nn2\nX\n\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n\n\u0393\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c0 1\u03b1 \u0393\u03c0 2\u03b2 .\n\n(120)\n\n\u03b1=1 \u03b2=1\n\nGiven \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c0 1\u03b1 \u0393\u03c0 2\u03b2 , we have also \u0393\u2020\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c0 2\u03b2 \u0393\u2020 \u03c0 1\u03b1 .

Its proof as well as\na partial generalization of it is given in Section 6 (Theorem 22). The eigenspaces of\n\u0393R \u0393\u2020R and \u0393\u2020R \u0393R for the same eigenvalue are identified isometrically through U. Let\nr = rank \u0393 = rank \u0393\u2020 , which is allowed to be \u221e, and let {gq }rq=1 be an orthonormal\nbasis for Ran \u0393 consisting of eigenvectors of \u0393R \u0393\u2020R with eigenvalues \u03b3 q > 0, and put\ngq\u2032 = Ugq .

We note, however, that,\nfor a fixed pair (\u03b1, \u03b2), the rank-one operators |gq\u03b1ihg \u2032\u03b2q |, for q = 1, . . . , r, are not in\ngeneral independent, so that \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 may be zero even if, for some q, gq\u03b1 and g \u2032 \u03b2q are both\nnonzero; in fact, the cardinality of {q : gq\u03b1 ihg \u2032\u03b2q | =\n6 0} may exceed the rank of \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 .\nWe organize the coupling information by introducing the n1 \u00d7 n2 coupling matrix\nM\u0393 with entries\n[M\u0393 ]\u03b1\u03b2 = rank \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 .\n(129)\nThe \u03b1\u03b2-component of the coupling matrix can be thought of as the number of coupling\nchannels between the components H1\u03b1 and H2\u03b2 . Rows of M\u0393 containing all zeros\nindicate components of H1 that split from the rest of the system H1 \u2295 H2 , and\ncolumns of all zeros indicate components of H2 that split from the rest of the system.\nIf the subspaces Hi\u03b1 can be reordered in such a way that M\u0393 attains a diagonal\nblock form (with not necessarily square blocks), then we see that the system splits\ninto completely decoupled subsystems, each with a nontrivial component in each of\nH1 and H2 made up of components Hi\u03b1 (i = 1, 2). This leads to an s-invariant\ndecomposition. In this case, it is possible to choose the gq differently if necessary so\nthat, for \u03b1\u03b2 off of the diagonal blocks, we have |gq\u03b1 ihg \u2032\u03b2q | = 0 for all q, as we will see.\nWe now examine s-invariant decompositions in more detail, that is, how H =\nH1 \u2295 H2 can be decomposed into independently evolving components of the form\nH1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 :\nn\nL\nH=\n(H1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 ) ,\n(130)\n\u03b1=1\n\nwhere H1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 is invariant under \u03a9 for each \u03b1. This means that Hi\u03b1 is invariant\nunder \u03a9i for i = 1, 2 and \u03b1 = 1, . . . , n and that the coupling operators \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 are equal to\nzero for \u03b1 6= \u03b2. In other words, this decomposition simultaneously block-diagonalizes\n\u03a91 , \u03a92 , and \u0393. For n = 2, for example, \u03a9 has the form\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u03a911 0 \u039311 0\n\uf8ef 0 \u03a912 0 \u039322 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(131)\n\u03a9=\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u0393\u202011 0 \u03a921 0 \uf8fb\n0 \u0393\u202022 0 \u03a922\n\nand \u0393\u0393\u2020 has the block-diagonal form\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0\n\u039311 \u0393\u202011\n\u2020\n,\n\u0393\u0393 =\n0\n\u039322 \u0393\u202022\n\n(132)\n\nfrom which we see that any eigenvector of \u0393\u0393\u2020 is decomposed with respect to H1 =\nn\nL\nH1\u03b1 into a sum of eigenvectors (possibly zero) of \u0393\u0393\u2020 with the same eigenvalue.\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n36\n\n\fThus each eigenspace of \u0393\u0393\u2020 admits an orthogonal decomposition into its intersections\nwith all of the H1\u03b1 . This is what allows us to choose the basis {gq } so that each is\ncontained in one of the H1\u03b1 . It follows that gq\u2032 is in H2\u03b1 .\nWe then ask, given any choice of basis {gq }, what is the finest decomposition of\nthe form (130) such that each gq is contained in one of the H1\u03b1 ? The answer requires\nconsidering the orbits of the vectors gq under \u03a91 and the orbits of the vectors gq\u2032 under\n\u03a92 . We see that if gq \u2208 H1\u03b1 for some q and \u03b1, it is required by the invariance of Hi\u03b1\nunder \u03a9i , for i = 1, 2, that O\u03a91 ({gq }) \u2208 H1\u03b1 and O\u03a92 ({gq\u2032 }) \u2208 H2\u03b1 . Further, the orbit\nO\u03a91 ({gq }) must be orthogonal to every gp that is not in H1\u03b1 and the orbit O\u03a92 ({gq\u2032 })\nmust be orthogonal to every gp\u2032 that is not in H2\u03b1 .\nTheorem 18 (canonical decomposition) Assume that the spectrum of \u0393\u0393\u2020 consists of a countable set of eigenvalues (and their accumulation points).\ni. Let an s-invariant splitting of (H, \u03a9) be given:\nH=\n\nn\nL\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n(H1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 ) .\n\n(133)\n\nThen there exists an orthonormal Hilbert-space basis {gq }rq=1 for Ran \u0393 of eigenvectors of \u0393\u0393\u2020 and corresponding basis {gq\u2032 = Ugq } for Ran \u0393\u2020 such that for each\nq, there exists \u03b1 such that gq \u2208 H1\u03b1 and gq\u2032 \u2208 H2\u03b1 .\nii. Given an arbitrary choice of basis {gq }rq=1 for Ran \u0393 consisting of eigenvectors\nof \u0393\u0393\u2020 , it follows that the finest s-invariant splitting (of the form (133)) such\nthat each gq is in some H1\u03b1 is obtained from the orbits\nH1\u03b1 = O\u03a91 ({gq : q \u2208 V\u03b1 }) and H2\u03b1 = O\u03a92 ({gq\u2032 : q \u2208 V\u03b1 }),\n\n(134)\n\nin which the V\u03b1 are the minimal (disjoint) subsets of {1, . . . , r} such that O\u03a91 ({gq :\nq \u2208 V\u03b1 }) \u22a5 gp and O\u03a92 ({gq\u2032 : q \u2208 V\u03b1 }) \u22a5 gp\u2032 for all p 6\u2208 V\u03b1 .\nIn part (ii) it is tacitly implied that such minimal subsets are well defined.\n\n6\n\nProofs of theorems\n\nIn this section we formulate detailed statements on the stucture of open systems and\nprovide their proofs, which encompass the proofs of the theorems from Sections 4 and\n5. The development follows that of those sections.\nWe use the same notation as in the previous sections.

This means that there are unitary operators\nU2 : H0 \u2192 Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2286 H2\n\nU1 : H0 \u2192 Ran \u0393 \u2286 H1 ,\n\n(139)\n\nwith\nU = U2 U1\u22121 : Ran \u0393 \u2192 Ran \u0393\u2020\n\n(140)\n\n\u03930 = U2\u22121 \u0393\u2020 U1 = U1\u22121 \u0393U2 .\n\n(141)\n\nsuch that\nSince Null \u0393\u2020 \u22a5 Ran \u0393, \u0393\u2020 is completely determined by its action on Ran \u0393, and the\npositive operator \u0393R \u0393\u2020R restricted to Ran \u0393 is represented by \u039320 on H0 through the\nisometric isomorphism given by U1 ; the analogous structure holds for \u0393\u2020R \u0393R :\n\u0393R \u0393\u2020R = U1 \u039320 U1\u22121 ,\n\n6.1\n\n\u0393\u2020R \u0393R = U2 \u039320 U2\u22121 .\n\n(142)\n\nReconstructibility from open subsystems\n\nThe following statement is a detailed version of Theorem 9.\nTheorem 19 (system reconstructiblity) There exists a unique minimal sub-Hilbertspace H\u2032 of H with the following properties:\na. H\u2032 is \u03a9-invariant (O\u03a9 (H\u2032 ) = H\u2032 ) and, hence, (H\u2032 , \u03a9\u21beH\u2032 ) is conservative;\nb. H\u2032 is P1 -invariant, that is, H\u2032 = H1c \u2295 H2c , where H1c \u2286 H1 and H2c \u2286 H2 ;\nc. Ran \u0393 \u2286 H\u2032 .\n38\n\n\fLet \u03a9ic = \u03a9i\u21beHic for i = 1, 2, \u0393c = \u0393\u21beH2c , a1 (t) = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 , and a2 (t) = \u0393\u2020 e\u2212i\u03a91 t \u0393.\nThe the following hold\ni. H1c = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) and H2c = O\u03a92 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ).\nii. (H\u2032 = H1c \u2295 H2c , \u03a9\u21beH\u2032 ) is reconstructible,\nH1 \u2295 H2c is the unique minimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) contained in H, and H1c \u2295 H2 is the unique minimal conservative extension of\n(H2 , \u03a92 , a2 (t)) contained in H.\niii. a1 (t)\u21beH1c = \u0393c e\u2212i\u03a92c t \u0393\u2020c and a1 (t)\u21be(H1 \u2296 H1c ) = 0,\na2 (t)\u21beH2c = \u0393\u2020c e\u2212i\u03a91c t \u0393c and a2 (t)\u21be(H2 \u2296 H2c ) = 0.\nThus the system H1c \u2295 H2c completely determines the friction functions a1 (t)\nand a2 (t). Neither a1 (t) nor a2 (t) is determined by any proper \u03a9-invariant\nsubsystem of H1c \u2295 H2c of the form H\u03031 \u2295 H\u03032 , where H\u0303i \u2282 Hi , i = 1, 2.\niv. (H1 \u2295H2 , \u03a9) is reconstructible if and only if H1 and H2 have no nontrivial \u03a9invariant subspaces.\nProof. There exists a sub-Hilbert-space H\u2032 of H possessing properties (a-c) because\nH is such a subspace. Let H\u2032 be an arbitrary such space. First, we show that\nRan \u0393\u2020 \u2282 H\u2032 . We have\nRan \u0393\u2020 = \u0393\u2020 (H1 ) = \u0393\u2020 (Ran \u0393)\n\n(143)\n\nsince Null \u0393\u2020 = H1 \u2296Ran \u0393. Let w \u2208 \u0393\u2020 (Ran \u0393), say w = \u0393\u2020 (u) for some u \u2208 Ran (\u0393) \u2282\nH\u2032 \u2229 H1 . Let \u01eb > 0 be given. Since \u03a91 is densely defined in H1 \u2229 H\u2032 , there exists\nv \u2208 Dom \u03a91 \u2229H\u2032 such that ku\u2212vk < \u01eb/k\u0393\u2020 k and hence kw\u2212\u0393\u2020 (v)k = k\u0393\u2020 (u\u2212v)k < \u01eb.\nBy (a,b), we obtain\n\u0393\u2020 (v) = (I \u2212 P1 )(\u03a91 (v) + \u0393\u2020 (v)) = (I \u2212 P1 )\u03a9(v) \u2208 H\u2032 .\n\n(144)\n\nSince \u01eb is arbitrary, we conclude that w \u2208 H\u2032 . We now know that\nO\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) \u2286 H\u2032 .\n\n(145)\n\nBut, using the definition (22) of the orbit under the action of two operators, we see\nthat O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) is itself P1 -invariant as follows:\nO\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9,\u0393\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9\u030a,\u0393\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a) = O\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393\u030a)\n= O\u03a9\u030a (Ran \u0393 \u2295 Ran \u0393\u2020 ) = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) \u2295 O\u03a92 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ).\n39\n\n(146)\n(147)\n\n\fDefining H1c and H2c as in (i), we see that H1c \u2295 H2c both satisfies properties\n(a-c) and is contained in our arbitrarily chosen H\u2032 with these properties. This proves\nthe uniqueness of a minimal subspace satisfying (a-c), namely, H\u2032 = O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) =\nH1c \u2295 H2c , as well as property (i).\nTo prove that (H\u2032 , \u03a9\u21beH\u2032) is reconstructible (part (ii)), we must show that H\u2032 =\nO\u03a9 (H1c ), which is the state space of the minimal conservative extension for H1c in\nH, and that H\u2032 = O\u03a9 (H2c ). Observe that Ran \u0393 \u2208 H\u2032 and choose again w and v as\nbefore. We have \u03a91 (v) \u2208 H1c , so that\n\u0393\u2020 (v) = \u03a9(v) \u2212 \u03a91 (v) \u2208 O\u03a9 (H1c ),\n\n(148)\n\nand k\u0393\u2020 (v) \u2212 wk < \u01eb. We conclude that\nRan \u0393\u030a \u2286 O\u03a9 (H1c ).\n\n(149)\n\nBut since H\u2032 = O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) and H1c \u2286 H\u2032 , we obtain\nO\u03a9 (H1c ) = H\u2032 .\n\n(150)\n\nAn analogous argument applies to H2c .\nTo prove the rest of part (ii), define H1d = H1 \u2296 H1c and H2d = H2 \u2296 H2c . Since\nH1d \u2295 H2d = H \u2296 H\u2032 , H1d \u2295 H2d is \u03a9-invariant. Since H1d is perpendicular to Ran \u0393,\nfor v \u2208 H1d \u2229 Ran \u03a9, \u03a9(v) = \u03a91 (v) + \u0393\u2020 (v) = \u03a91 (v) \u2208 H1d , and we see that H1d itself\nis \u03a9-invariant. Therefore, so is H1 \u2295 H2c , and we obtain\nO\u03a9 (H1 ) = O\u03a9 (H1d ) \u2295 O\u03a9 (H1c ) = H1 \u2295 H2c\n\n(151)\n\nThat O\u03a9 (H2 ) = H2 \u2295 H1d is shown similarly.\nTo prove part (iii), let v \u2208 H1c be given. Then\na1 (t)v = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020 v = \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92 t \u0393\u2020c v\n(because v \u2208 H1c )\n= \u0393e\u2212i\u03a92c t \u0393\u2020c v\n(because \u0393\u2020c v \u2208 Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2282 H2c )\n= \u0393c e\u2212i\u03a92c t \u0393\u2020c v\n(because e\u2212i\u03a92c t \u0393\u2020c v \u2208 H2c ).\nLet v \u2208 H1 \u2296 H1c be given. Then v \u22a5 Ran \u0393, so that v \u2208 Ker \u0393\u2020 . The analogous\nstatement about a2 (t) is proven similarly. Finally, if H\u03031 \u2295 H\u03032 is a proper subspace of\nH\u2032 = H1c \u2295 H2c that is invariant under \u03a9 and P1 , then Ran \u0393 6\u2282 H\u03031 . This is because\nH\u2032 is the minimal such space that contains Ran \u0393. Since a1 (0) = \u0393\u0393\u2020 , we have\nRan a1 (0) = Ran \u0393 6\u2282 H\u03031 . This means that the restriction of the system (H\u2032 , \u03a9\u21beH\u2032 )\nto H\u03031 \u2295 H\u03032 does not determine a1 (0), and therefore does not determine the function\na1 (t).\n40\n\n\fTo prove part (iv ), first observe that, if H1 \u2295 H2 is not reconstructible, then H1d ,\nwhich is \u03a9-invariant, is nontrivial. Conversely, suppose that H1 has an \u03a9-invariant\nsubspace H1\u2032 \u2282 H1 . Set H1\u2032\u2032 = H1 \u2296 H1\u2032 , and let H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032\u2032 = O\u03a9 (H1\u2032\u2032 ). Then the\nminimal conservative extension of (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) is O\u03a9 (H1 ) = H1\u2032 \u2295 H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2\u2032\u2032, so\nthat H2\u2032\u2032 = H2c . For all v \u2208 H2c \u2229 Dom (\u03a9), \u03a9(v) = \u0393(v) + \u03a92 (v) \u2208 H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2c .\nThus \u0393(v) \u22a5 H1\u2032 , so that Ran \u0393 \u22a5 H1\u2032 and hence Ran \u0393 \u2282 H1\u2032\u2032. Since H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2c =\nO\u03a9 (H1\u2032\u2032 \u2295 H2c ) \u2282 O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) = H1c \u2295 H2c , we obtain H1\u2032 \u22a5 H1c so that H1 \u2295 H2 is\nnot reconstructible.\nRemark 20 Of all \u03a9-invariant subsystems of the form H\u03031 \u2295 H\u03032 with H\u0303i \u2282 Hi ,\ni = 1, 2, H1c \u2295 H2c is the minimal reconstructible one that has the property that\nRan \u0393 \u2282 H1c . There may exist \u03a9-invariant subsystems of the same form such that\nRan \u0393 6\u2282 H1c (this is dealt with in Theorem 18) and \u03a9-invariant subsystems that are\nnot of this form, which do not concern us.\nTheorems 13, 14, and 15 are rather straightforward applications of standard spectral theory of self-adjoint operators in separable Hilbert space.

This means that dE\u03bb is an (orthogonal) projection-valued Borel\nmeasure on R such that, for each v \u2208 H, the vector-valued function of \u03bc given by\nZ\nd(E\u03bb v)\n(152)\n(\u2212\u221e,\u03bc]\n\nis right-continuous,\n\nZ\n\nd(E\u03bb v) = lim\n\n\u03bc\u2192\u221e\n\nR\n\nand, for each f \u2208 Cc (R),\n\nf (\u03a9)v =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd(E\u03bb v) = v,\n\n(153)\n\n(\u2212\u221e,\u03bc]\n\nf (\u03bb) d(E\u03bbv) ;\n\n(154)\n\nR\n\nintegration is understood in the Lebesgue-Stieltjes sense.\nThe orbit of a subset S \u2282 H generated by the action of \u03a9 can be expressed in\nterms of continuous functions of \u03a9 or in terms of spectral projections:\nO\u03a9 (S) = closure of span {f (\u03a9)v : v \u2208 S, f \u2208 Cc (R)}\n(155)\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\n= closure of span\nd(E\u03bb v) : v \u2208 S, B a Borel set\n(156)\nB\n\u001aZ\n\u001b\n= closure of span\nd(E\u03bb v) : v \u2208 S, \u2206 an interval in R with |\u2206| < (157)\n\u01eb ,\n\u2206\n\n41\n\n\fin which \u01eb is an arbitrary positive real number.\nProof of Theorems 13, 14, and 15.\nParts (ii ) of Theorems 13 and 14 are\nstatements of the representation (157) of the \u03a9-orbits of H1 and Ran \u0393\u030a and the \u03a92 orbit of Ran \u0393\u2020 . We have already shown (see equation 101) that Hmin is generated\nthrough the action of \u03a9 on the range of \u0393\u030a.\nTo prove parts (i ) of these theorems, observe that, in the case of pure point\nspectrum,\nN\nX\nEj \u03b4(\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bb),\n(158)\ndE\u03bb =\nj=1\n\nin which \u03b4 is the unit measure concentrated at \u03bb = 0, the \u03bbj are the distinct eigenvalues of \u03a9, the Ej are orthogonal projections, and N may be equal to \u221e. Consider\nthe representation (156): for any vector v \u2208 S and Borel set B,\nZ\nX\nd(E\u03bb v) =\nEj v.\n(159)\nB\n\nj:\u03bbj \u2208B\n\nRIn particular, Ej v \u2208 O\u03a9 (S) (by taking B = {\u03bbj }) for j = 1, . . . , N, and each vector\nd(E\u03bb v) is in the closure of the linear span of the Ej v. It follows that\nB\nO\u03a9 (S) = closure of span {Ej v : j \u2208 {1, . . . , N}, v \u2208 S} =\n\nN\nM\n\nEj (S).\n\n(160)\n\ni=1\n\nThe statements (i ) of the theorems follow from applying this result to the respective\noperator \u03a9 and set S.\nL\nTo prove parts (iii ) of the theorems, observe that, since H = N\ni=1 Ran (Ej ),\n\u22a5\n\nO\u03a9 (S) =\n\nN\nM\ni=1\n\n(Ran (Ej ) \u2296 Ej (S)) .\n\n(161)\n\nSuppose that S is a subspace of H, and let P denote the projection onto S. Then,\nfor any eigenvector, say \u03c6 \u2208 Ran (Ej ), we have a splitting \u03c6 = \u03c61 + \u03c62 , where\n\u03c61 \u2208 Ej (S) \u2286 O\u03a9 (S) and \u03c62 \u2208 Ran (Ej ) \u2296 Ej (S) \u2286 O\u03a9 (S)\u22a5 . Thus, P (\u03c61 ) = 0 and\n\u03c62 = Ej (v) for some v \u2208 S. From\nk\u03c62 k2 = kEj (v)k2 = hv|Ej (v)i = hv|\u03c62 i,\n\n(162)\n\nwe infer that \u03c62 = 0 if and only if \u03c62 \u22a5 S, that is, if and only if P (\u03c62 ) = 0. But we\nalso see that \u03c62 = 0 if and only if \u03c6 \u22a5 Ej (S), which is true if and only if \u03c6 \u2208 O\u03a9 (S)\u22a5 .\nIt follows that\nO\u03a9 (S)\u22a5 = {0} if and only if P (\u03c6) 6= 0 for each (nonzero) eigenvector of \u03a9.\n42\n\n(163)\n\n\fThis result applies directly to the first part of (iii ) of Theorem 13 because Hmin =\nO\u03a9 (H1 ). For the second part and part (iii ) of Theorem 14, (163) applies after observing that (1) Hmin = H1 \u2295 H2c = H1c \u2295 H2c = O\u03a9 (Ran \u0393\u030a) if and only if H1c = H1\nand (2) P denotes projection onto Ran \u0393\u030a, then for each v \u2208 H, P (v) = 0 if and only\nif \u0393(v) = 0-this is because \u0393\u030a is self-adjoint so that the nullspace of \u0393\u030a is equal to\n(Ran \u0393\u030a)\u22a5 .\nTheorem 15 follows from the fact that, if S is a subspace of H, then the multiplicity\nof \u03a9 restricted to O\u03a9 (S) is bounded by the dimension of S.\n\n6.2\n\nDecomposition of coupled systems\n\nThe next statement on the equivalence between decoupling of an open system and\ns-invariant decompositions of its minimal conservative extension is a detailed version\nof Theorem 17.\nTheorem 21 (decoupling and s-invariant decomposition) Let an open linear\nsystem (H1 , \u03a91 , a1 (t)) be given, and let (H, \u03a9) be its minimal conservative extension,\nwith P1 , H2 = H \u2296 H1 , \u03a92 , and \u0393 : H2 \u2192 H1 defined as before.\ni.

By the self-adjointness of \u03a91 ,\nH1 \u2296 H1\u03b1 is \u03a91 -invariant, so that H1\u03b2 = O\u03a91 ({gq : q \u2208 V\u03b2 }) \u2282 H1 \u2296 H1\u03b1 ,\nand we conclude that H1\u03b1 \u22a5 H1\u03b2 . Now, O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) = O\u03a91 ({gq }rq=1 ) =\nL\nn\nreconstructible, H1 = H1c = O\u03a91 (Ran \u0393) by\n\u03b1=1 H1\u03b1 , and since (H, \u03a9) isL\nTheorem 9.LTherefore H1 = n\u03b1=1 H1\u03b1 . The analogous argument proves\nthat H2 = n\u03b1=1 H2\u03b1 . We now prove the invariance of H1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 under \u03a9.\nHi\u03b1 is by construction invariant under \u03a9i . Let v \u2208 H1\u03b1 . Then v = u + w\nfor some u \u2208 span {gq : q \u2208 V\u03b1 } and w \u2208 H1\u03b1 \u2296 span {gq : q \u2208 V\u03b1 } Since\nw \u22a5 H1 \u2296 H1\u03b1 , we see that w \u22a5 span {gq : q 6\u2208 V\u03b1 }, so that w \u22a5 Ran \u0393\nand therefore w \u2208 Ker \u0393\u2020 . We now obtain \u0393\u2020 (v) = \u0393\u2020 (u) \u2208 span {gq\u2032 : q \u2208\nV\u03b1 } \u2282 H2\u03b1 . The invariance of H1\u03b1 \u2295 H2\u03b1 under \u03a9 now follows.\n\u0011\n\u0010\nL\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nbe a \u03a9-invariant decomposition of H such that\n\u2295\nH\nH\n(b) Let H = m\n2\n1\n\u03b2=1\neach gq is in one of the H1\u03b2 . Fix \u03b1, and let p, q \u2208 V\u03b1 , so that gp , gq \u2208 H1\u03b1\nand gq\u2032 , gp\u2032 \u2208 H2\u03b1 . Since G contains an edge between p and q, one of the\nconditions (181) is satisfied. Assume that it is that O\u03a91 (gp ) 6\u22a5 gq (the\nother case is handled analogously). Let \u03b2 be such that gp \u2208 H1\u03b2 ; it follows\n\u2032\nthat gp\u2032 \u2208 H2\u03b2 . Since O\u03a91 (gp ) \u2282 H1\u03b2 and H1\u03b2 \u22a5 H1\u03b2 for \u03b2 6= \u03b2 \u2032 , we have\ngq \u2208 H1\u03b2 . We conclude that gq \u2208 H1\u03b2 and gq\u2032 \u2208 H2\u03b2 for all q \u2208 V\u03b1 , so that\nH1\u03b1 \u2282 H1\u03b2 and H2\u03b1 \u2282 H2\u03b2 .\n\niii. Suppose the spectrum of \u03930 is simple. Then the representations\n(179) and\n\u0011 (179)\nLm \u0010 \u03b2\n\u03b2\nare unique, so that by part (i), each decomposition \u03b2=1 H1 \u2295 H2 has the\nproperty that each gq is in some H1\u03b2 . The construction of the Hi\u03b1 from part\n(2) has the property that for each \u03b1, there exists a \u03b2 such that Hi\u03b1 \u2282 Hi\u03b2 for\ni = 1, 2.\n\nRemark 23 If we do not assume in part (2) that H is reconstructible, then the result\ncan be applied to the minimal reconstructible subsystem H1c \u2295H2c of H. The decoupled\ncomponents Hid can be decomposed into \u03a9i -invariant subspaces arbitrarily, and these\nare automatically \u03a9-invariant because they are contained in Ker \u0393\u2020 or Ker \u0393.\n47\n\n\fThe first half of Theorem 22 generalizes to operators with arbitrary spectrum. We\nremind the reader of the standard definition of an abstract resolution of the identitiy:\nDefinition 24 (resolution of identity) Given a set X and a \u03c3-algebra B of subsets of X containing the empty set and X, we say that \u03c0 : B \u2192 L(H) is a resolution\nof the identity IH if\ni. \u03c0(A) is an orthogonal projection for all A \u2208 B,\nii. \u03c0(\u2205) = 0, \u03c0(X) = IH ,\niii. \u03c0(X \\ A) = IH \u2212 \u03c0(A) for all A \u2208 B,\niv. \u03c0(A1 \u2229 A2 ) = \u03c0(A1 )\u03c0(A2 ) for all A1 , A2 \u2208 B,\nv. \u03c0(A1 \u222a A2 ) = \u03c0(A1 ) + \u03c0(A2 ) for all A1 , A2 \u2208 B with A1 \u2229 A2 = \u2205,\nvi. \u03c0(\n\n\u221e\nT\n\ni=1\n\n\u221e\n\nAi ) = s lim \u03c0(Ai ) for all sequences {Ai }\u221e\ni=1 from B with Ai+1 \u2282 Ai .\ni=1\n\n\u03c0 is said to commute with an operator T if, for all A \u2208 B, \u03c0(A)T = T \u03c0(A).\nThese properties are not independent. For example, property (v) is implied by\nthe first four, but we include it because of its conceptual relevance.\nThe statement below is partial generalization of Theorem 18 for \u0393 with general\nspectrum.\nTheorem 25 Let \u03c0 be a resolution of the identity on H that commutes with \u03a9 and\nP1 . Then there exists a resolution E\u03c0 of the identity on H0 that commutes with \u03930 ,\nsuch that, for all A \u2208 B,\nUi E\u03c0 (A) = \u03c0(A)Ui ,\n\ni = 1, 2,\n\n(190)\n\nfrom which it follows that\nRan (Ui E\u03c0 (A)) = Ran (\u03c0(A)) \u2229 Hi\u0393 ,\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(191)\n\nThe proof of Theorem 25 is based on the following lemma.\nLemma 26 Let G1 \u2295 G2 be s-invariant, with G1 \u2286 H1 and G2 \u2286 H2 . Then there\nexists a \u03930 -invariant subspace G0 of H0\u0393 such that\nUi \u03c0 G0 = \u03c0 Gi Ui ,\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(192)\n\nIn fact,\nG0 = U1\u22121 (Ran \u0393 \u2229 G1 ) = U2\u22121 (Ran \u0393\u2020 \u2229 G2 ).\n48\n\n(193)\n\n\fProof. From Theorem 19, part (i), we see that G := G1 \u2295 G2 is invariant under \u03a9\u030a\nand therefore also under the self-adjoint operator \u0393\u030a; in other words, \u0393\u030a commutes with\nthe orthogonal projection \u03c0 G onto G in H. Therefore,\n(Ran \u0393\u030a) \u2229 G = \u0393\u030a(G) = \u03c0 G (Ran \u0393\u030a),\n\n(194)\n\nwhich is seen from the decomposition Ran \u0393\u030a = \u0393\u030a(G)\u2295 \u0393\u030a(H\u2296G). From \u03c0 G = \u03c0 G1 \u2295\u03c0 G2\nand the definition of \u0393\u030a, we find that (194) admits the decomposition\n(Ran \u0393)\u2229G1 \u2295(Ran \u0393\u2020 )\u2229G2 = \u0393(G2 )\u2295\u0393\u2020 (G1 ) = \u03c0 G1 (Ran \u0393)\u2295\u03c0 G2 (Ran \u0393\u2020 ). (195)\nIn addition, \u0393\u030a2 (G) = \u0393\u030a(G), from which we obtain\n\u0393(\u0393\u2020 (G1 )) = \u0393(G2 ) and \u0393\u2020 (\u0393(G2 )) = \u0393\u2020 (G1 ).\n\n(196)\n\n\u0393\u030a(G) is invariant under \u0393\u030aR , and therefore also under the unitary self-adjoint involution\n\u016e on Ran \u0393\u030a = Ran \u0393 \u2295 Ran \u0393\u2020\n\u0010 \u0011\u22121/2\n\u016e := \u0393\u030a2R\n\u0393\u030aR ,\n(197)\nin which we take the square root\n\u0010\n\n\u0393\u030a2R\n\n\u00111/2\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\n(\u0393R \u0393\u2020R )1/2\n0\n\u2020\n0\n(\u0393R \u0393R )1/2\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\nUsing \u0393\u030a(G) = \u0393(G2 ) \u2295 \u0393\u2020 (G1 ) and that\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0 U \u22121\n,\n\u016e =\nU\n0\n\n(198)\n\n(199)\n\nwe obtain U\u0393(G2 ) \u2286 \u0393\u2020 (G1 ) and U \u22121 \u0393\u2020 (G1 ) \u2286 \u0393(G2 ), so that U\u0393(G2 ) = \u0393\u2020 (G1 ), and\nsince U = U2 U1\u22121 , we may define\nG0 := U1\u22121 \u0393(G2 ) = U2\u22121 \u0393\u2020 (G1 ).\n\n(200)\n\nG0 is \u03930 -invariant because\n\u03930 (G0 ) = U1\u22121 \u0393U2 G0 = U1\u22121 \u0393\u0393\u2020 (G1 ) = U1\u22121 \u0393(G2 ) = G0 .\n\n(201)\n\nFinally, since U1 takes H0\u0393 isomorphically to H1\u0393 , we have\nU1 \u03c0 G0 = \u03c0 \u0393(G2 ) U1 ,\n49\n\n(202)\n\n\fin which the domain of \u03c0 \u0393(G2 ) is H1\u0393 , and from (195), we see that \u03c0 G1 coincides with\n\u03c0 \u0393(G2 ) on H1\u0393 so that\nU1 \u03c0 G0 = \u03c0 G1 U1 .\n(203)\nU2 \u03c0 G0 = \u03c0G2 U2 is obtained analogously.\nProof of Theorem 25.\nWe define a map E\u03c0 : B \u2192 L(H0 ) and show it is a\nresolution of the identity with the desired property. Let A \u2208 B be given, and set\nG1 = Ran P1 \u03c0(A) and G2 = Ran P2 \u03c0(A). We put\nE\u03c0 (A) = \u03c0 G0 ,\n\n(204)\n\nwhere G0 is provided by Lemma 26; the property desired in the Theorem is thus\nprovided by the lemma. Properties (i) and (ii) of a resolution of the identity are\ntrivially verified for E\u03c0 . To see property (iii), let G\u03030 = E\u03c0 (X\\A) and G\u0303i = Hi \u2296 Gi =\nRan Pi \u03c0(X \\A), and use\n\u03c0 G0 = Ui\u22121 \u03c0 Gi Ui\n\nand \u03c0G\u03030 = Ui\u22121 \u03c0 G\u0303i Ui ,\n\n(205)\n\nto calculate\nE\u03c0 (A) + E\u03c0 (X \\ A) = \u03c0 G0 + \u03c0 G\u03030 = Ui\u22121 (\u03c0 Gi + \u03c0 G\u0303i )Ui = Ui\u22121 IHi Ui = IH0 .\n\n(206)\n\nTo prove property 4 of Definion 24, let A, B \u2208 B, and compute\nE\u03c0 (A \u2229 B) = U1\u22121 \u03c0(A \u2229 B)U1 = U1\u22121 \u03c0(A)\u03c0(B)U1\n= U1\u22121 \u03c0(A)U1 U1\u22121 \u03c0(B)U1 = E\u03c0 (A)E\u03c0 (B).
