These systems can be studied numerically with the density\nmatrix renormalization group(DMRG), but existing algorithms are inefficient. Here, we introduce\na much more efficient DMRG algorithm for Y-junction systems. As an example of the use of this\nmethod, we study S = 21 bound states in Heisenberg S = 1 junctions with two geometries, one\nwhere the junction consists of a single site, and the other where it consists of a triangle of three\nsites.\n\nJunctions are essential ingredients of existing and future electronic and spintronic devices. As progress towards smaller and smaller devices continues, eventually\nwe will reach the atomic scale. Perhaps the smallest conceivable junctions are composed of intersecting spin or\nelectron chains, with each site representing a single atom.\nIsolated chains, modeled by Heisenberg, Hubbard, and\nrelated Hamiltonians, have been extensively studied. Yet\nsurprisingly little work has been done on the corresponding junctions of three or more half-chains, or legs. There\nhas been recent work on junctions of quantum wires. For\nexample, Oshikawa, et al[1, 2] studied the transport properties of a junction composed of three quantum wires enclosing a magnetic flux, modeling the chains as spinless\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquids, and finding a rich phase diagram. Quantum Monte Carlo on junctions of fermion\nchains are subject to the minus sign problem, so little\nnumerical work has been done. We are not aware of any\nstudies which have focused on junctions of spin chains.\nOur present work has two main aspects. First, we\ndevelop a new density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) algorithm for studying junctions. Ordinary\nDMRG[3] is much less efficient for junctions compared to\nchains with open boundaries; our new method requires\nonly slightly more computational effort. Second, as an\napplication of this method we consider a key feature of\na few of the simplest junctions, namely the presence of\nS = 21 \"spinon\" bound states in two types of S = 1\nHeisenberg Y junctions. These bound states are the analogues of the spin- 21 end states found in open S = 1\nchains[4, 5]. They exist at any S = 1 junction with an\nodd number of legs, regardless of the local interactions at\nthe junction. Magnons coming to the junction can interact with the bound state via spin-flip scattering, leading\nto potentially interesting dynamical phenomena. We call\nthese spinon bound states because a spin- 12 degree of freedom is bound to the junction, but it is important to note\nthat they are features of the ground state. A separate issue, which we do not address here, is whether the lowest\nexcited state is below the Haldane gap, representing, say,\na magnon bound to the junction. For example, a single\nS = 12 impurity in a S = 1 chain has such a bound state\nbelow the gap only for sufficiently weak coupling to the\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n(e)\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic view for the geometric configuration and\nalgorithm for Y-junctions.The geometry of the Y-junctionis\nshown in (a), where the circles represent sites and the solid\nlines represent connections. The alternative geometry Y\u2206\njunction is shown in (b). The original DMRG method is\nshown in (c), where one cuts the link between two sites and\nrelinks it to the center of the remaining chain, making it topologically equivalent to a Y-junction. Verstraete and Cirac's\ntensor representation is shown in (d), where each open circle represents a tensor and each solid dot represents a tensor\nindex. An Affleck-Kenedey-Lieb-Tasaki valence bond picture\nof the Y-junction is shown in (e), where each solid dot represents a S = 12 , the line segments represent valence bonds,\nand where each open circle represents a projection operator\nto the S = 1 subspace for a site.\n\nimpurity[6].\nWe consider two types of three-leg junctions, which we\nwill label Y and Y\u2206 , where we think of the \u2206 as a triangle. These are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). DMRG\nis extremely efficient for one dimensional systems with\nshort range interactions. It is standard to treat twodimensional strips by mapping the strip into a chain with\ninteractions over a distance of several lattice spacings.\nSimilarly, a Y junction can be treated as a chain with\none long range interaction, shown in Fig. 1(c). The\nlong-range interaction is equivalent to periodic bound-\n\n\f2\nary conditions in terms of the effort necessary in DMRG:\na typical block of sites connects to the rest of the system by two links in both cases. If m states per block are\nrequired for a given accuracy for a single chain, one expects roughly m2 states to be needed for the Y junction\n(or a periodic chain). This changes the computational\neffort from O(N m3 ) to O(N m6 ), where N is the number\nof sites.\nAs discussed below, our new algorithm scales as\nO(N m3 + m4 ). Typically m and N are similar in size\n(say \u223c 102 ), so the cost is close to that of a single chain,\nand a large improvement over the method with a longrange interaction. Our algorithm is somewhat related to\nOtsuka's early DMRG treatment of the XXZ model on\na Bethe lattice[7]. It is closely related to Shi, Duan, and\nVidal's very recent treatment[8] of general tree-tensor\nnetworks using Vidal's time-evolving block decimation\nmethod, which is closely related to DMRG. One can also\nview it as perhaps the simplest step towards an implementation of Verstraete and Cirac's much more complicated tensor approach[9, 10], which holds great promise\nfor true two dimensional systems.\nConsider the matrix product representation for the\nwavefunction in standard DMRG[11]\n|\u03a8i = A[s1 ]A[s2 ]A[s3 ]...A[sn ]|s1 s2 s3 ...sn i\n\n|k>\n\n|i>\n(a)\nEnvironmental block\n\nNew system block\n|j>\n\n(b)\nEnvironment\n\nSystem\n\nsweep to the left\n\n(c)\nEnvironment\n\nSystem\n\n(1)\n\nwhere si labels the states of site i, and A[si ] is a matrix\nexcept for the first and last sites, where it is a vector. One\ncan view each matrix as a two-dimensional tensor, with\nindices connecting to the left and right. In Verstraete\nand Cirac's approach for a square lattice, one generalizes\nto four-dimensional tensors, with indices connecting to\neach nearest neighbor. In our approach, only one tensor is needed, at the junction site, and it has only three\nindices. All sites on the legs are ordinary matrices, as\nshown in Fig. 1(d). Unlike in the more general tensor\napproach, the states can be easily described in terms of\nan orthogonal basis.\nThe key to our approach is a new type of step for the\njunction. In this \"junction step\" the system is divided\ninto three blocks instead of two (one for each leg), and\nthe calculation time is higher, O(m4 ), where m is the\nnumber of states kept per block, instead of O(m3 ). The\nrest of a sweep consists of steps involving two blocks,\nwhere one of the blocks contains two legs plus part of the\nthird. The sweep moves out to the end of one leg, and\nthen back to the center, after which the junction step is\nrepeated, and then the sweep goes out another leg, etc.,\nuntil all legs have been treated.\nWe now describe this method in more detail. The system is built up in a warmup sweep. An ordinary DMRG\nchain initialization sweep is first carried out on one leg of\nthe Y-junction. For the environment block one can use\nthe next several sites of the leg, or artifically reflect the\nleg\u2013the algorithm is not very sensitive to the warmup,\nand we keep only a small number of states m, storing the\n\nFIG. 2: Configurations illustrating the new DMRG algorithm. The procedure starts from the center (a), where two\nlegs are combined to form a new system block. The sweep\nnext progress down a single leg, as in (b), reaches the end of\nthe leg, (c), and comes back to the center.\n\nrelated operator matrices and transformation matrices.\nOne continues until the entire leg is incorporated into\nthe block. At the last few steps the environment may or\nmay not be in the form of a junction-it does not make\nmuch difference. This block is then duplicated twice to\nform the other two legs.\nAt this point, the finite-system sweeps begin. The first\nstep is the junction step. For the Y-junction, where the\njunction consists of a single site, that site is incorporated\ninto one leg. The wavefunction can be written as \u03c8ijk ,\nwhere i, j, and k refer to the three legs/blocks. Applying the operators appearing in the Hamiltonian H to\n\u03c8 requires a calculation time of O(m)4 , in contrast to\nthe O(m)3 time on a chain. For example, to apply the\nz\nterm Siiz \u2032 Sjj\n\u2032 connecting the first two legs, one first mulz\ntiplies the matrix Sjj\n\u2032 into \u03c8i\u2032 j \u2032 k , storing the result, and\nthen multiplies that result by Siiz \u2032 . Several such multiplications by H are performed to make a few Lanczos or\nDavidson steps to find an approximate ground state \u03c8.\nAfter finding \u03c8 we want to combine two legs (say j and\nk) into a single effective block, as shown in Fig. 2(a).

For\nthe Y-junction, the first site shown is the center junction site.\nHere, the total spin of the system is Sz = 21 .\n\nthe system block, and diagonalize it, which in this case\nwould result in a calculation time of O(m6 ). Instead,\nwe perform a singular value decomposition (SVD) on \u03c8,\ntreating j and k together as a single combined index,\nand i as the other index of the matrix. The SVD has\na calculation time of only O(m4 ), but is equivalent to\nthe density matrix diagonalization. (Note, however, that\nthe SVD is not as easily generalized to having more than\none state targeted.) One obtains transformation matrices\nO\u03b1,jk , where \u03b1 are the new states of the combine blocks.\nThe operators for the combined block A\u2032 are obtained as\nOAOT ; this can also be performed in O(m4 ) time. For\n+\n\u2212\nexample, to transform Sjj\n\u2032 Skk\u2032 , one first forms X\u03b1,j \u2032 k =\n+\n\u2212\nO\u03b1,jk Sjj \u2032 , then Y\u03b1\u2032 ,j \u2032 k = Skk\u2032 O\u03b1\u2032 ,j \u2032 k\u2032 , and then contracts\nXY over indices j \u2032 k.\nNext, as shown in Fig. 2(b), we sweep down leg i.\nThis sweep is an ordinary DMRG sweep, with calculation\ntime O(m3 ) per site; the fact that the system block now\nincludes two legs does not affect calculations in each step.\nWe continue moving to the edge of the leg, Fig. 2(c),\nand then turn around and come back to the center. The\njunction step is performed and then the sweep moves out\none of the other legs. The three legs need not be identical;\nthe sweep treats each independently. In each full sweep,\nthe center step is performed three times. Alternatively,\nif the Hamiltonian and the desired state are symmetric\nwith respect to the interchange of legs, just before the\njunction step one can replace each of the legs with the\nmost recently updated leg/block.\nFor an 3 \u00d7 N system, the total cpu time is O(m4 +\nN m3 ). In comparison, we consider the standard DMRG\ncalculation with one long range interaction. In Fig. 3 we\nshow the error in the energy as a function of the number\n\nof states kept for the new versus the standard algorithm;\nthe new algorithm requires vastly fewer states. If we\nassume the long range interaction mandates O(m2 ) states\nbe kept for sufficient accuracy (for large N ), the standard\nDMRG calculation would scale as O(N m6 ).\nWe now use the new algorithm to study S = 21 bound\nstates in S = 1 Heisenberg junctions. A simple consideration of quantum numbers makes the presence of the\nbound states clear. An S = 1 open chain has S = 21 states\non the ends, and a finite correlation length \u03be = 6.03[4].\nThe ends of the legs in a large junction system will also\nhave S = 21 states; the finite correlation length does\nnot allow the junction to influence the ends. With an\nodd number of legs, a half-integer-spin state must form\nat the junction to make the total spin an integer. For\na junction formed from very weakly coupled legs, the\nbound state comes from coupling three effective S = 12\nstates at the junction. For more strongly coupled legs one\ncan think in terms of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki\n(AKLT) picture[12] where each S = 1 is composed of\ntwo S = 21 's, with one valence bond singlet connecting\ntwo S = 21 's on each near-neighbor link; see Fig. 1(e).\nAt the junction, there must be one S = 12 left over after\nthe singlets are formed.\nIn order to study the junction bound state, it is convenient to place a real S = 21 spin on the end of each chain\n(far from the junction), which forms a singlet with the\neffective S = 12 , eliminating it as a low energy degree of\nfreedom. For the Y-junction, the ground state is then a\nnondegenerate doublet corresponding to total Sz = \u00b1 12 .\nIn Fig. 4 we show hSz (l)i as a function of site l for a\n3 \u00d7 60 Y-junction. The result for the other two legs is\nidentical. We see a strong similarity with the results for\n\n\f4\nJ), but then one expects a S = 12 end state on each\nleg starting at the site adjacent to the junction, and one\nwould expect these three S = 12 's to be weakly coupled\nantiferromagnetically through the central triangle.\nIf we square the total spin operator for a generic\nHeisenberg triangle, we obtain\n\n0.5\n\n< Sz >\n\n0.3\n0.1\n-0.1\nleft chain\nright chain\ndown chain\n\n-0.3\n-0.5\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nsite\nFIG. 5: Results for hSz(l)i for a 3 \u00d7 60 Y\u2206 -junction, where\nsite 0 is part of the junction triangle.\n\nthe end state of a single chain, except for a smaller magnitude of the oscillations. The decay of the oscillations is\nconsistent with an exponential decay with the correlation\nlength of a single chain[4]. Looking near the junction we\nfind the initially surprising result that the value of |hSz i|\nat the junction site (0.30) is less than that on the first\nsite of a leg (0.34). If one thinks in terms of a meanfield/classical picture, with the spin fluctuations acting\nlike thermal fluctuations, one would expect the opposite:\nthe junction site is surrounded by three polarized spins,\nand would experience a larger polarizing field than the\nadjacent sites which have only two neighbors. However,\nif one utilizes the AKLT valence bond picture instead,\none would predict a smaller magnitude at the junction\nsite: the extra unpaired S = 12 is energetically favored to\nbe on an adjacent site, with one missing valence bond,\nas shown in Fig. 1(e). An unpaired spin on the junction\nsite occurs from fluctuations of the unpaired S = 21 from\nleg to leg.\nNow consider the other geometric configuration, the\nY\u2206 -junction. Fig. 5 shows hSz (l)i for a Y\u2206 -junctionwith\nsize 3 \u00d7 60. One sees the presence of a bound state at the\njunction, as for the Y-junction. However, the symmetry\nunder interchange of legs is broken by an exact ground\nstate degeneracy.\nTo understand this degeneracy, consider a three-site\nS = 12 Heisenberg triangle. The S = 21 triangle is clearly\nrelevant in the limit that the exchange couplings connecting the three junction sites to each other is very small.\nIn that case the S = 21 's are the end states of each leg.\nIn the opposite limit, where the exchange between the\nS = 1's in the junction is large, the ground state of the\nS = 1 triangle is nondegenerate (with a gap of precisely\n\n1\nE\n= (Stot (Stot +1)\u2212S1 (S1 +1)\u2212S2 (S2 +1)\u2212S3(S3 +1)).\nJ\n2\n(2)\nHere S1 = S2 = S3 = 12 , and Stot can be either 21 or 23 .\nThe ground states have energy \u2212 34 J and consist of two\ndegenerate Stot = 12 doublets. If one regards the triangle\nas a periodic chain, then the degeneracy corresponds to\ntotal momenta around the triangle of k = \u00b12\u03c0/3. The\nStot = 32 multiplet has k = 0 and energy 34 J. The Y\u2206 junction has the same degeneracy as the ground states\nof the triangle; the numerical calculation converges to a\narbitrary linear combination of these states. We have\nconfirmed the degeneracy behaves as expected by targetting several states on a relatively small Y\u2206 -junction\nsystem.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a relatively simple\nDMRG algorithm for junction systems, with greatly improved computational effort. We have used this to study\nthe S = 21 bound states of two types of Heisenberg S = 1\nY-junction.\nWe thank S. Chernyshev, F. Verstraete, and I. Affleck\nfor helpful conversations.
