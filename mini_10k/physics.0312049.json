Contrary to\nprevious findings, premelting effects are also present at such medium sizes, and they turn out to\nbe even stronger than the melting process itself for Na133 or Na135 . These results indicate that the\nempirical potential is qualitatively unadequate to model sodium clusters.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe early days of cluster thermodynamics were first\nmostly concerned with theoretical of numerical studies\nof simple rare-gas aggregates. Beyond the now generally\naccepted idea that melting in finite atomic clusters appears as a first-order transition rounded by size effects,1\nit was also observed in simulations that these system can\nexhibit dynamical coexistence,2 a process in which the\ncluster fluctuates in time between its solidlike and liquidlike states.\nWhile no experiment has yet permitted to test these\npredictions on the very same clusters, recent observations\nachieved in the group lead by Haberland3,4,5 have provided valuable qualitative and quantitative information\nabout the way sodium clusters melt, by extracting the full\ncaloric curves from photodissociation measurements. In\nparticular these authors reported that the melting point\nand the latent heat of fusion both vary strongly and nonmontonically with size.4 These results significantly attracted the attention of theoreticians, who since then\ntried to interpret or reproduce these unexpected complex variations using a variety of models.6,7,8,9,10,11,12\nFurther evidence was also seeked in indicators, which\nare alternative to the caloric curves, such as the electric polarizability,13 the photoabsorption spectrum,14 or\nthe ionization potential.11\nUp to now, none of the above cited theoretical works\nhas been able to reach a fully satisfactory quantitative\nagreement with experiments. The situation is largely\ndue to the expected strong interplay between geometric and electronic effects, which could be responsible for\nthe variations of the thermodynamic quantities. However, the previous simulations have brought some clues\nabout the relevance of the various models and potentials\nused to describe simple metal clusters. For instance, it\nwas seen that the distance dependent tight-binding (TB)\nmodel developed by Poteau and Spiegelman15 overestimated melting points by more than 20 percents. This\nwas interpreted as the consequence of the parameterization of this model, carried out on small clusters only but\nnot on bulk properties.7 On the other hand, both the empirical embedded-atom model (EAM) potential6,7,11,12\nand orbital-free density functional9 calculations lead to\na notable underestimation. Unfortunately, more realistic\nsimulations still lack the extent of phase space sampling\n\nrequired for a precise computation of the melting point\nabove 50 atoms.\n\nNumerical experiments\n\nIn our previous works, we concluded that melting in\nsodium clusters actually occurs differently in the smallest and in medium to large sizes clusters.6,7 While the\ncaloric curve of the smallest clusters (having less than\nabout 80 atoms) exhibit several features due to multiple isomerizations prior melting, the heat capacity of the\nlarger sizes mainly has one main peak indicating melting in a non ambiguous way. This could partly explain\nwhy experimental measurements do not find such premelting features above 55 atoms, and also why they have\ndifficulties in getting a clear, single-peak picture below\nthis size. More recently we noticed that premelting effects could also be artefactually due to poorly converged\nsimulations.8\nBased on our previous results, the disagreement between experimental measurements and the results of both\nthe TB and EAM models seemed mostly quantitative.\nOne could hope in getting a much better agreement by\nsuitably modifying the parameters, after including both\nmolecular and bulk properties, possibly through allowing\nthese parameters to become size-dependent. However,\nthe range of sizes that was investigated by us and by\nothers was quite limited,6,7,11,12 with only very few sizes\nabove 80. Moreover, the mediocre agreement for the latent heats of fusion lead us revisit the problem with newly\navailable simulation methods and less ambiguous tools of\nanalysis.\nWe have performed exchange Monte Carlo canonical\nsimulations16 of the clusters Nan with 55 \u2264 n \u2264 145,\nn being a multiple of 5 in this range, plus the following\nsizes n = 59, 93, 127, 129\u2013131, 133, 139, 142, and 147.\nThe clusters are again described using the same empirical\nmany-body EAM potential whose parameters are given\nin Ref. 17, and each simulation consisted of 107 cycles following 2 \u00d7 106 equilibration cycles for each of the 31 trajectories characterized by their temperature Ti = i\u00d710 K\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 30 plus i = 1.5. The starting structures for\nall clusters was always chosen to be the result of basinhopping global optimization carried out with 10 sets of\n104 quenches. All were found to be based on the icosahe-\n\n\f2\ndral motif. The absence of any different structural motif such as octahedral or decahedral for the sizes studied\nhere is very favorable for the simulations to reach equilibrium and not fall into broken ergodicity problems, as one\nmajor cause for such difficulties precisely lies in the energy landscape having several funnels.18,19 Each cluster\nwas simulated 5 times independently, with different random seeds, and we used a hard-wall spherical container\nwith radius Rmax = 7n1/3 . The caloric curves were constructed from the distributions of potential energies using\na multihistogram technique. In Ref. 7, we calculated the\nlatent heat of melting, L, as the integral of the heat capacity minus the Dulong-Petit contribution. This lead\nto appreciable overestimates, mostly due to the neglect\nof anharmonicities. Here we proceed similarly to the experimental approach of Schmidt and coworkers,4 namely\nby fitting the low- and high-temperature parts of the internal energy as straight lines and defining L as the gap\nbetween these lines at the melting point Tmelt. The melting point itself is defined as the temperature at which the\nlast heat capacity peak has its maximum: in cases where\n(k)\nthere are several peaks each centered around Tmelt the\n(k)\ntrue melting temperature is taken as maxk {Tmelt}. The\nlow- and high-temperature parts are defined as T \u2264 50 K\nand T \u2265 250 K, respectively. Therefore, if premelting\nevents are present between these limits, they will contribute to the latent heat.\nResults and discussion\n\n300\n\nTmelt (K)\n\n250\n200\n150\n\nL (meV/atom)\n\n100\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n170\n\nSize\nFIG. 1: Melting point Tmelt and latent heat of melting L of\nsodium cluster clusters versus their size. The open squares\nare the experimental results of Schmidt et al.5 , the full circles\nare for Monte Carlo simulations using the empirical potential.\n\nThe variations of Tmelt and L with size are sketched in\nFig. 1 along with the latest experimental data of Schmidt\n\nand coworkers.5 Except for very low sizes, we first notice that the melting points computed here are significantly lower than the ones we previously reported.7 This\nis an unfortunate consequence of using the q-jumping\nmethod with un inappropriate Tsallis parameter.20 However they are comparable to the ones obtained by Garz\u00f3n\nand coworkers in the microcanonical ensemble.12 Since\nwe expect the differences between this ensemble and the\ncanonical ensemble to become smaller and smaller for\nincreasing sizes, this agreement appear as a mutual confirmation of the convergence of both calculations, even\nthough they rely on very different numerical experiments.\nInterestingly, the experimental and theoretical variations of Tmelt with size appear to be related to each other,\nespecially if we shift the simulation data around size 120\nby about 15 atoms and 70 K. This had not been noticed\nbefore, and is probably fortuitous. But it may also hide\nthat some mechanisms causing the strong variations in\nthe experimental results close to 140 atoms are indeed\nthe same here, only occuring sooner.\nIn Fig. 1 one should also notice that the melting point\nat n = 55 is not the highest, as clusters having 59 or 60\natoms are more resistant to an increase in temperature.\nHowever, we were not able to extract any latent heat for\nthese sizes (nor for n = 65 and 70) due to very broad heat\ncapacity peaks. Therefore one should maybe not give too\nmuch importance to the melting points extracted from\nthese curves.\nWhile the melting temperatures are usually well below the experimental data (except in the vicinity of 130\natoms), the computed latent heats show a reasonable\noverall agreement, even though the complex variations\nare not as sharply seen as in the measurements of Schmidt\net al.8 A definitive comparison would require one to extend the range of sizes. As far as latent heats are concerned, the difference between the present results and our\npreviously published data7 comes nearly entirely from the\ndifferent way of estimating L, which is now much closer\nto the experimental way.\nThe heat capacity curves in the range 125 \u2264 n \u2264 135\nare all plotted in Fig. 2 versus temperature. Despite\nstrong changes from one size to another, a regular evolution can be seen from 125 atoms and above this size.\nThe heat capacity consists of two peaks, the melting (or\nhigh-temperature) peak being centered near 203 K. The\nsmaller peak, denoted as premelting peak in the following, goes from 100 to about 180 K in a quite continuous\nfashion. The premelting peak is surprisingly strong, and\ncan be clearly distinguished from the melting peak. Strikingly, it is even stronger than the melting peak itself at\nsize 133.\nTo interpret these curves, we have chosen to focus on\nNa133 , by carrying periodic quenches from instantaneous\nconfigurations extracted from the Monte Carlo simulations for all trajectories. We thus gathered nearly 14000\ndifferent isomers. Fig. 3 shows the energy of these isomers versus their rank, as well as the discrete spectrum\nof isomers versus the temperature of the trajectory from\n\n\f3\n1500\n\n2.0\n\n135\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nHeat capacity (kB)\n\n1300\n1100\n200\n\n900\n\n300\n\n400\n\n125\n\nT/K\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n133\n700\n\n131\n\n0.0\n\n129\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n500\n\n10000\n\nIsomer\n\n127\n\n300\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature (K)\nFIG. 2: Heat capacities of sodium clusters calculated with\nexchange Monte Carlo using the empirical potential, in the\nsize range 125 \u2264 n \u2264 135.

Both graphs clearly indicate\na correlation between the repartition of isomers in energy\nspace, their number and the heat capacities. Small variations in Cv occur below 150 K, but are hardly visible\nwhen compared to the main peaks. They are related to\nthe first few hundreds of isomers, which involve the migration of a limited number of some of the missing atoms\non the external layer of the icosahedron (the 135-atom\ncluster has Ih symmetry with all vertex atoms missing).\nThe presence of two major peaks in Cv is consistent\nwith the two main increases in the number of isomers\nhaving less than a given energy. Most new isomers appearing between 150 and 190 K have their rank between\n1000 and 5000 in the upper part of Fig. 3. Looking at\ntheir structure reveals that they are all still based on the\ntwo-layer icosahedron, but that the third layer is hardly\nrecognisable. Hence this case of premelting is an extreme\nillustration of surface melting following preliminar surface reconstruction.21 Eventually, above 200 K the icosahedral structure is completely lost and the true (volume)\nmelting takes place.\nIf now we look more closely at the results obtained for\nNa135 , we notice that the main peak is indeed located at\nthe same temperature as the premelting peak in Na133 ,\nand that the true melting peak of the latter cluster has\nbeen replaced by a right shoulder. Thus the same phenomena seem to be present in Na135 , only with different\nrelative magnitude. This case could be referred to as\n'post-melting'.\nTo some extent, this progressive evolution of the premelting and melting peaks can be compared to what has\nbeen observed in small Lennard-Jones (LJ) clusters by\nFrantz.22 In these systems, a premelting peak starts ap-\n\nFIG. 3: Quenching analysis of the Monte Carlo trajectories for\nNa133 . Lower panel: spectra of isomers versus temperature.\nUpper panel: energy versus isomer rank.\n\npearing close to the size 31 corresponding to the competition between Mackay-type and anti-Mackay-type icosahedral structures. The premelting peak remains as the\ncluster size increases, and it is shifted to higher temperatures before becoming higher than the melting peak itself\nnear the size 38.22 Because of the structural similarities\nbetween LJ clusters and the present sodium clusters, it\nis likely that the present observations express the same\nqualitative mechanisms. However, a significant quantitative difference can be seen in the caloric curves of LJ\nclusters and sodium clusters, as the melting peak is never\nreally well resolved for van der Waals systems until it has\nreplaced the premelting peak. Here the two peaks are\nof very similar widths, but their respective heights vary\nstrongly, their total contribution to the latent heat being\nnearly constant.\nUp to now, experimental data did not find any evidence for any pronounced premelting peak in the heat\ncapacities of charged sodium clusters.3,4,5 This indicates\nthat the present empirical potential is qualitatively unadequate to describe these systems. In particular, beyond\na simple scaling of the parameters of the potential, we\ndo not expect the use of explicit, size-dependent parameters to improve the situation notably. We repeated the\nabove simulation for Na133 using the more realistic quantum distance-dependent tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian\ndescribed in Ref. 15, but we had to reduce the statistics\n\n\f4\nto 106 cycles following 2 \u00d7 105 equilibration cycles (per\ntrajectory) for the computation to be tractable. Even\nthough melting points were shown to be overestimated,7\nwe also noticed8 that premelting effects were quite reduced using this model, in better consistency with experiments. The heat capacity computed from exchange\nMonte Carlo simulations is reported in the inset of Fig. 2.\nFor this calculation we neglected the (weak) effects of\nnonzero electronic temperature.8 The starting configuration was taken as the same one as for the classical potential, but we did not find any more stable structure during\nthe course of the simulation.\nAt first sight, the caloric curve looks similar to the\nclassical result, with a clear premelting peak. However\nusing the TB Hamiltonian has two consequences. First,\nthe premelting peak is much lower than the melting peak,\nwhich is in agreement with our previous general observation that the empirical potential overemphasizes premelting features.7,8 More importantly, premelting also occurs\nmuch closer in temperature to the melting peak itself.\nThis also suggest that premelting is not seen experimentally simply because it is too broad.\nConclusion\n\nIn the present work, we have obtained some evidence\nthat premelting effects in the caloric curves of sodium\nclusters could be present at unexpectingly large sizes.\nWe also found that some clusters could exhibit 'postmelting', a process in which the premelting effect is\nstronger than the actual melting peak.

In this respect, it resembles more the\nmeasurements by Schmidt et al.4\nEven though our calculations overestimate premelting\neffects, they provide insight into the possible causes for\nthe nonmonotonic variations of the melting point. In\nparticular, they suggest that such variations may reflect\npremelting becoming actual melting. The discrepancies\nwith the present work would then be ascribed to a possible merging of the premelting feature into one shoulder\nof the melting peak, but not necessarily on the low temperature side.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank H.
