Elaborating on [1, 2], Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena\n2\n\n\f[3] proposed a theory conjectured to be dual to M2 branes probing a C4 /Zk singularity,\nwhere Zk acts with weights (1, 1, \u22121, \u22121) on the coordinates of C4 . This low energy\n\ntheory on the worldvolume of N coincident M2 branes is a U(N)k \u00d7 U(N)\u2212k quiver\nChern-Simons (CS) theory, with a marginal quartic superpotential whose coefficient is\nrelated by the high degree of SUSY to the CS coupling. Indeed, for generic CS coupling\nk the theory enjoys N = 6 SUSY, and as such possesses an SO(6)R symmetry which\n\nis manifest in the potential [4]. The theory is then automatically conformal at the\nquantum level. For k = 1, 2 the SUSY is enhanced to N = 8. In field theory it\nhas been argued [3] that this enhancement is due to quantum effects where 't Hooft\nmonopole operators play a key r\u00f4le. Indeed, the ABJM theory has just the right\nstructure [5] for these monopole operators to have appropriate quantum numbers that\nthen allow for such a symmetry enhancement.\nMotivated by this progress in understanding the maximally SUSY case, it is natural to consider M2 branes moving in less symmetric spaces, leading to versions of\nthe duality with reduced SUSY. Inspired by ABJM [3], the theories considered are\nQG\na=1 U(N)ka quiver CS (QCS) theories with bifundamental matter. The r\u00f4le of the\nP\nCS levels is far from trivial, and it has been argued in [6, 7] that the sum G\na=1 ka\n\ncorresponds to the Type IIA SUGRA Romans mass parameter. In this paper we will\nfocus entirely on the case in which the CS levels sum to zero; the Romans mass then\nvanishes and the system admits an M-theory lift.\n\nSince the kinetic terms for the gauge fields are given by the CS action, the only\nclassically dimensionful parameters are the superpotential couplings. Strong gauge\ndynamics is then conjectured to drive the theory to a superconformal IR fixed point.\nIn [8, 9, 10], a general analysis of the moduli spaces of such superconformal gauge\ntheories was presented. In particular, it is crucial that the CS levels sum to zero if\nthere is to be a so-called geometric branch of the moduli space which is a Calabi-Yau\nfour-fold cone, where the branes are interpreted as moving. In parallel to the ABJM\ncase, multiplying the vector of CS levels by an integer orbifolds this moduli space in\na certain way. More precisely, the theory with k = gcd{ka } has a (abelian) moduli\nspace which is a Zk quotient of the moduli space of the theory with CS levels {ka /k}.\nGenerically this group will not act freely away from the tip of the cone. In this case\none might expect additional gauge symmetries at such fixed points. This has recently\n\nmotivated [11, 12] the consideration of dual field theories which involve fundamental,\nas well as bifundamental, matter. It is however fair to say that, at present, there is no\ncomprehensive understanding of these constructions.\n3\n\n\fOn general grounds, the presence of global symmetries is of great help in classifying\nthe spectrum of a gauge theory. One particularly important such global symmetry is\nthe R-symmetry. In three dimensions a theory preserving N supersymmetries admits\nthe action of an SO (N ) R-symmetry. Thus the existence of a non-trivial R-symmetry,\nwhich can then provide important constraints on the dynamics, requires that we focus\non N \u2265 2, implying there is at least a U(1)R . In particular it then follows that, assuming the theory flows to an IR superconformal fixed point, the scaling dimensions\nof chiral primary operators coincide with their R-charges. We note that, generically,\nthe N = 2 theories considered have classically irrelevant superpotentials. Strong gauge\n\ndynamics is required to give large anomalous dimensions, thus making it possible to\nreach a non-trivial IR fixed point. However, in three dimensions there are few independent field theory checks on the existence of such a fixed point. For example, there is\nno useful analogous version of a-maximization [13], which for four-dimensional N = 1\n\ntheories allows one to determine the R-charge in the superconformal algebra at the IR\nfixed point. This places the conjectured dualities on a much weaker footing than their\nfour-dimensional cousins in Type IIB string theory.\nThe N = 2 QCS theories that we consider are expected to be dual to M2 branes\n\nmoving in a Calabi-Yau four-fold cone over a seven-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein base\nY , thus giving rise to an AdS4 \u00d7 Y near horizon dual geometry. Such Sasaki-Einstein\n\nmanifolds Y will typically have non-trivial topology, implying the existence of KaluzaKlein (KK) modes obtained by reduction of SUGRA fields along the corresponding\nhomology cycles. Of particular interest are five-cycles, on which one can reduce the\nM-theory six-form potential to obtain b2 (Y ) = dim H2 (Y, R) vector fields in AdS4 .\nThese vector fields are part of short multiplets of the KK reduction on Y , known as\nBetti multiplets [14, 15] (for a discussion relevant to the cases we will consider, see also\n[16, 17]). In analogy with the Type IIB case, where these symmetries are well-known\nto correspond to global baryonic symmetries [18], we will sometimes employ the same\nterminology here and refer to these as baryonic U(1)s.\nIn this paper we set out to study the above symmetries in the AdS4 /CF T3 correspondence. In the rather better-understood AdS5 /CF T4 correspondence in Type\nIIB string theory, from the field theory point of view these baryonic U(1) symmetries\nappear as non-anomalous combinations of the diagonal U(1) factors inside the U(N)\ngauge groups.1 The key point is that, in four dimensions, abelian gauge fields are IR\nfree and thus become global symmetries in the IR. However, this is no longer true in\n1\n\nFor a complete discussion of the Type IIB case we refer to e.g. [19, 20, 21].\n\n4\n\n\fthree dimensions, thus raising the question of the fate of these abelian symmetries.\nFrom the gravity perspective, in the dual AdS4 the vector fields admit two admissible\nfall-offs at the boundary of AdS4 [22, 23]. This is in contrast to the AdS5 case where\nonly one of them, that which leads to the interpretation as dual to a global current, is\nallowed. That the two behaviours are permitted implies that the corresponding boundary symmetries remain either gauged or ungauged, respectively, defining in each case a\ndifferent boundary CFT. This issue is closely related to the gauge groups being either\nU(N) or SU(N) in the case at hand. From the point of view of the QCS theory with\nU(N) gauge groups, at lowest CS level k = 1 there is no real distinction between U(N)\nand U(1) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge groups [3, 24, 25] . Therefore the discussion in [22] can be\napplied to the abelian part of the symmetry. In this way it is possible to connect the\nSU(N) and the U(N) theories in a rather precise manner, while keeping track of the\ncorresponding action on the gravity side, which amounts to selecting one particular\nfall-off for the vector fields in AdS4 . This provides motivation to look at the SU(N)\nversion of the theory as dual to a particular choice of boundary conditions in the dual\ngravity picture.\nIn the first part of this paper we focus on the simplest class of examples, namely\nisolated toric Calabi-Yau four-fold singularities with no vanishing six-cycles (no exceptional divisors in a crepant resolution). These are discussed in more detail in \u00a7A.\n\nIn particular we study in detail the example of C(Q111 ). A dual U(N)4 QCS field\ntheory was proposed for this singularity in [26], and further studied in [27] where the\nnon-abelian chiral ring of the theory (at large k) was shown to precisely match the coordinate ring of the variety. Motivated by the analysis of the behaviour of gauge fields\nin AdS4 , we will choose boundary conditions where the b2 (Q111 ) = 2 Betti multiplets\nare dual to global symmetries. This amounts to focusing on a certain version of the\ntheory with gauge group U(1)2 \u00d7SU(N)4 . On the other hand, gauge fields in AdS4 can\n\nhave a priori both electric sources, corresponding to wrapped M5 branes, and magnetic sources, corresponding to wrapped M2 branes. It turns out that the boundary\nconditions necessary to define the AdS/CF T correspondence allow for just one of the\ntwo types at a time [22]. In particular, the chosen U(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)4 quantization allows\nonly for electric sources; that is, wrapped supersymmetric M5 branes. In turn, these\ncorrespond to baryonic operators [28] in the field theory that are charged under the\nglobal symmetries. We will analyse this correspondence in detail, finding the expected\nagreement.\nOn the other hand, magnetic sources correspond to M2 branes [28]. While in the AdS\n5\n\n\fgeometry these wrap non-supersymmetric cycles, we can also consider resolutions of the\ncorresponding cone where there are supersymmetric wrapped M2 branes. Along the\nlines of [29, 30], we will identify the relevant operator, responsible for the resolution,\nwhich is acquiring a VEV. Very much as in reference [30], it is possible to find an\ninterpretation of these solutions as spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) through the\nexplicit appearance of a Goldstone boson in the SUGRA dual.\nA natural next step is to enlarge the class of singularities under consideration by\nallowing dual geometries with exceptional six-cycles. One such example is a Z2 orbifold\nof C(Q111 ) known as C(Q222 ). A dual field theory candidate has been proposed in\n[27, 31, 32]. Further tests of this theory were performed in [27], where it was shown that\nits chiral ring matches the gravity computation at large k. The interpretation of such\nsix-cycles is somewhat obscure holographically. Indeed, such six-cycles, when resolved,\ncan support M5 brane instantons leading to non-perturbative corrections [33]. In the\nsecond part of this paper we set up the study of such corrections by finding a general\nexpression for the Euclidean action of such branes in terms of normalizable harmonic\ntwo-forms, and compute this explicitly for Q222 . We leave a full understanding of such\nnon-perturbative effects from the gauge theory point of view for future work.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we review the Freund-Rubintype solutions which are eleven-dimensional AdS4 \u00d7 Y backgrounds. We then turn\n\nto KK reduction of the SUGRA six-form potential on five-cycles in Y , leading to the\nBetti multiplets of interest. General analysis of gauge fields in AdS4 shows that two\npossible fall-offs are admissible. We then review the construction in [22] relating these\ndifferent boundary conditions for a single abelian gauge field in AdS4 to the action of\nSL(2, Z). In \u00a73 we turn in more detail to the field theory description. We start by\nreviewing general aspects of U(N) QCS theories that have appeared in the literature,\nbefore turning in \u00a73.2 to the example of interest. We then propose a set of boundary\nconditions dual to the U(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)4 theory. We identify the ungauged U(1)s via the\nelectric M5 branes wrapping holomorphic divisors in the geometry. In \u00a74 we turn to the\nspontaneous breaking of these baryonic symmetries. We compute on the gravity side\nthe baryonic condensate and identify the Goldstone boson of the SSB. In \u00a75 we initiate\nthe study of exceptional six-cycles. We compute the warped volume of a Euclidean\nbrane in the resolved C(Q222 ) geometry. By extending our results on warped volumes\n\nto arbitrary geometries, both for the baryonic condensate and the Euclidean brane,\nwe find general formulae for such warped volumes. We end with some concluding\ncomments in \u00a76. Finally, a number of relevant calculations and formulae are collected\n6\n\n\fin the appendices.\nNote added: as this paper was being finalized the preprint [70] appeared, which\nhas partial overlap with our results.\n\n2\n\nAdS4 backgrounds and abelian symmetries\n\nWe begin by reviewing general properties of Freund-Rubin AdS4 backgrounds, and also\nintroduce the Q111 and Q222 = Q111 /Z2 examples of main interest. KK reduction of\nthe M-theory potentials on topologically non-trivial cycles leads to gauge symmetries\nin AdS4 . We review their dynamics in the AdS/CF T context and the sources allowed,\ndepending on the chosen quantization. Of central relevance for our purposes will be\nwrapped supersymmetric M5 branes.\n\n2.1\n\nFreund-Rubin solutions\n\nThe AdS4 backgrounds of interest are of Freund-Rubin type, with eleven-dimensional\nmetric and four-form given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2\n2\n2\n2\nds11 = R\nds (AdS4 ) + ds (Y ) ,\n(2.1)\n4\n3 3\nG =\nR Vol(AdS4 ) .\n8\nHere the AdS4 metric is normalized so that R\u03bc\u03bd = \u22123g\u03bc\u03bd . The Einstein equations imply\nthat Y is an Einstein manifold of positive Ricci curvature, with metric normalized so\nthat Rij = 6gij . The flux quantization condition\nZ\n1\n\u22c611 G = N \u2208 Z ,\n(2\u03c0lp )6 Y\n\n(2.2)\n\nthen leads to the relation\nR = 2\u03c0lp\n\n\u0012\n\nN\n6vol(Y )\n\n\u00131/6\n\n,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere lp denotes the eleven-dimensional Planck length.\nAs is well-known, such solutions arise as the near-horizon limit of N M2 branes\nplaced at the tip r = 0 of the Ricci-flat cone\nds2 (C(Y )) = dr 2 + r 2 ds2 (Y ) .\n7\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fMore precisely, the eleven-dimensional solution is\nds211 = h\u22122/3 ds2 (R1,2 ) + h1/3 ds2 (X) ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nG = d3 x \u2227 dh\u22121 ,\nwhere in the case at hand we take the eight-manifold X = C(Y ) with conical metric\n(2.4). Placing N Minkowski space-filling M2 branes at r = 0 leads, after including\ntheir gravitational back-reaction, to the warp factor\nh=1+\n\nR6\n.\nr6\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn the near-horizon limit, near to r = 0, the background (2.5) approaches the AdS4\nbackground (2.1). In fact the warp factor h = R6 /r 6 is precisely the AdS4 background\nin a Poincar\u00e9 slicing. More precisely, writing\nz=\n\nR2\n,\nr2\n\n\u0001\nds2 (AdS4 ) = z \u22122 dz 2 + ds2 (R1,2 ) ,\n\nleads to the metric (2.1).\nSupersymmetries N\n1\n2\n3\n\nY\nweak G2 holonomy\nSasaki-Einstein\n3-Sasakian\n\n(2.7)\n\nC(Y )\nSpin(7) holonomy\nSU(4) holonomy (Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler)\nSp(2) holonomy (hyperK\u00e4hler)\n\nTable 1: Relation between the number of supersymmetries N in AdS4 and the special\nEinstein geometry of Y and its cone C(Y ).\nWe shall be interested in solutions of this form preserving supersymmetry in AdS4 .\nThe well-known result [34] is summarized in Table 1. As mentioned in the introduction,\nin general N supersymmetries leads to the R-symmetry group SO(N ), and thus supersymmetry provides a strong constraint on the spectrum only for N \u2265 2. We hence\nrestrict attention to the N = 2 Sasaki-Einstein case, which includes the N = 3 geome-\n\ntry as a special case. It is then equivalent to say that the cone metric on C(Y ) is K\u00e4hler\nas well as as Ricci-flat, i.e. Calabi-Yau. Geometries with N \u2265 4 supersymmetries are\n\nnecessarily quotients of S 7 .\n\nOnly a decade ago the only known examples of such Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds\nwere homogeneous spaces. Since then there has been dramatic progress. 3-Sasakian\nmanifolds, with N = 3, may be constructed via an analogue of the hyperK\u00e4hler quo-\n\ntient, leading to rich infinite classes of examples [35]. For N = 2 supersymmetry one\n8\n\n\fcould take Y to be one of the explicit Y p,k manifolds constructed in [36], and further\nstudied in [37, 38], or any of their subsequent generalizations. These N = 2 examples\n\nare all toric, meaning that the isometry group contains U(1)4 as a subgroup. In fact,\ntoric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds are now completely classified thanks to the general existence and uniqueness result in [39]. At the other extreme, there are also non-explicit\nmetrics in which U(1)R is the only isometry [35].\n\nHowever, for our purposes it will be sufficient to focus on two specific homogeneous\nexamples, namely Q111 and Q222 = Q111 /Z2 , with Z2 \u2282 U(1)R being along the Rsymmetry of Q111 . These will turn out to be simple enough so that everything can be\ncomputed explicitly, and yet at the same time we shall argue that many of the features\nseen in these cases hold also for the more general geometries mentioned above. In\nboth cases the isometry group is SU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)R , and in local coordinates the explicit\nmetrics are\n\n1\nds2 =\n16\n\nd\u03c8 +\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i\n\n!2\n\n3\n\n\u0001\n1X\n+\nd\u03b8i2 + sin2 \u03b8i d\u03c62i .\n8 i=1\n\n(2.8)\n\nHere (\u03b8i , \u03c6i ) are standard coordinates on three copies of S 2 = CP1 , i = 1, 2, 3, and \u03c8\nhas period 4\u03c0 for Q111 and period 2\u03c0 for Q222 . The two Killing spinors are charged\nunder \u2202\u03c8 , which is dual to the U(1)R symmetry. The metric (2.8) shows very explicitly\nthe regular structure of a U(1) bundle over the standard K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric on\nCP1 \u00d7 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , where \u03c8 is the fibre coordinate and the Chern numbers are (1, 1, 1)\nand (2, 2, 2) respectively. These are hence natural generalizations2 to seven dimensions\nof the T 11 and T 22 manifolds.\n\n2.2\n\nC-field modes\n\nOne might wonder whether it is possible to turn on an internal G-flux GY on Y , in\naddition to the G-field in (2.1), and still preserve supersymmetry, i.e.\n3\nG = R3 Vol(AdS4 ) + GY .\n8\n\n(2.9)\n\nIn fact necessarily GY = 0. This follows from the results of [41]: for any warped CalabiYau four-fold background with metric of the form (2.5), one can turn on a G-field GX\non X without changing the Calabi-Yau metric on X only if GX is self-dual. But for a\ncone, with GX = GY a pull-back from the base Y , this obviously implies that GX = 0.\n2\n\nThe other natural such generalization is the homogeneous space V5,2 = SO(5)/SO(3), which has\nbeen studied in detail in [40].\n\n9\n\n\fHowever, more precisely the G-field in M-theory determines a class3 in H 4 (Y, Z).\nThe differential form part of G captures only the image of this in H 4 (Y, R), and so\nGY = 0 still allows for a topologically non-trivial G-field classified by the torsion\n4\npart Htor\n(Y, Z). This is also captured, up to gauge equivalence, by the holonomy of\nthe corresponding flat C-field through dual torsion three-cycles in Y . There are hence\n4\n|Htor\n(Y, Z)| physically distinct AdS4 Freund-Rubin backgrounds associated to the same\n\ngeometry, which should thus correspond to physically inequivalent dual SCFTs. In a\nsmall number of examples with proposed Chern-Simons quiver duals, including the\noriginal ABJ(M) theory, different choices of this torsion G-flux have been argued to\nbe dual to changing the ranks in the quiver [40, 43]. However, the related Seiberg-like\ndualities are currently very poorly understood in examples without Hanany-Wittentype brane duals. In particular, for example, one can compute H 4 (Q111 , Z) \u223c\n= Z2 ,\n\nimplying there are two distinct M-theory backgrounds with the same Q111 geometry\nbut different C-fields. This is an important aspect of the AdS4 /CF T3 duality that we\nshall not discuss any further in this paper.\n\nMore straightforwardly, if one has b3 (Y ) = dim H3 (Y, R) three-cycles in Y then one\ncan also turn on a closed three-form C with non-zero periods through these cycles.\nIncluding large gauge transformations, this gives a space U(1)b3 (Y ) of such flat C-fields.\nSince these are continuously connected to each other they would be dual to marginal\ndeformations in the dual field theory. Indeed, the harmonic three-forms on a SasakiEinstein seven-manifold are in fact paired by an almost complex structure [44] and\nthus b3 (Y ) is always even, allowing these to pair naturally into complex parameters as\nrequired by N = 2 supersymmetry. However, for the class of toric singularities studied\nin this paper, including Q111 and Q222 , it is straightforward4 to show that b3 (Y ) = 0\nand there are hence no such marginal deformations associated to the C-field.\nFinally, since H6 (Y, R) = 0 for any positively curved Einstein seven-manifold, there\nare never periods of the dual potential C6 through six-cycles in Y .\n\n2.3\n\nBaryonic symmetries and wrapped branes\n\nOf central interest in this paper will be symmetries associated to the topology of Y , and\nthe corresponding charged BPS states associated to wrapped M branes. By analogy\n3\n\nThis is true since the membrane global anomaly described in [42] is always zero on a seven-manifold\nY that is spin.\nP5\n4\nThere are, however, examples: the Calabi-Yau four-fold hypersurfaces i=1 zid = 0, where d =\n3, 4, are known to have Calabi-Yau cone metrics, and these have b3 (Y ) = 10, 60, respectively [44].\n\n10\n\n\fwith the corresponding situation in AdS5 \u00d7 Y5 in Type IIB string theory, we shall refer\nto these symmetries as baryonic symmetries; the name will turn out to be justified.\nDenote by b2 (Y ) = dim H2 (Y, R) the second Betti number of Y . By Poincare duality we have dim H5 (Y, R) = dim H2 (Y, R) = b2 (Y ). Let \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1b2 (Y ) be a set of\ndual harmonic five-forms with integer periods. Then for the AdS4 \u00d7 Y Freund-Rubin\nbackground we may write the KK ansatz\nb2 (Y )\n2\u03c0 X\n\u03b4C6 =\nA I \u2227 \u03b1I ,\nT5 I=1\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere T5 = 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0lp )6 is the M5 brane tension. This gives rise to b2 (Y ) massless U(1)\ngauge fields AI in AdS4 . For a supersymmetric theory these gauge fields of course sit\nin certain multiplets, known as Betti multiplets. See, for example, [14, 15, 16, 17].\n2.3.1\n\nVector fields in AdS4 , boundary conditions and dual CFTs\n\nThe AdS/CF T duality requires specifying the boundary conditions for the fluctuating\nfields in AdS. In particular, vector fields in AdS4 admit different sets of boundary\nconditions [22, 23] leading to different boundary CFTs. In order to see this, let us\nconsider a vector field in AdSd+1 . Using the straightforward generalization to AdSd+1\nof the coordinates in (2.7), in the gauge Az = 0 the bulk equations of motion set\nA\u03bc = a\u03bc + j\u03bc z d\u22122 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere a\u03bc , j\u03bc satisfy the free Maxwell equation in Lorentz gauge in the Minkowski space.\nIt is not hard to see that in d < 4 both behaviours have finite action, and thus can be\nused to define a consistent AdS/CF T duality.\nLet us now concentrate on the case of interest d = 3, where both quantizations are\nallowed. In order to have a well-defined variational problem for the gauge field in AdS4\nwe should be careful with the boundary terms when varying the action. In general, we\nhave\n\u221a\nZ n \u221a\nn \u2202 \u221adet g L\no\n\u2202 det g L o\n\u2202 det g L\n\u03b4AM + \u2202N\n\u2212 \u2202N\n\u03b4AM .\n(2.12)\n\u03b4S =\n\u2202AM\n\u2202\u2202N AM\n\u2202\u2202N AM\nThe bulk term gives the equations of motion whose solution behaves as (2.11). In turn,\nthe boundary term can be seen to reduce to\nZ\n1\nj\u03bc \u03b4a\u03bc d3 x .\n(2.13)\n\u03b4SB = \u2212\n2 Boundary\n11\n\n\fTherefore, in order to have a well-posed variational problem, we need to demand \u03b4a\u03bc =\n0; that is, we need to impose boundary conditions where a\u03bc is fixed in the boundary.\nOn the other hand, since in d = 3 both behaviours for the gauge field have finite\naction, we can consider adding suitable boundary terms such that the action becomes\n[23]\nZ\nZ\np\n1 p\n1\nAB\nS=\ndet g FAB F\n+\ndet g A\u03bc Fr\u03bc |Boundary d3 x.\n(2.14)\n4\n2 Boundary\n\nThe boundary term is now\n\n1\n\u03b4SB =\n2\n\nZ\n\na\u03bc \u03b4j \u03bc d3 x ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nBoundary\n\nso that we need to impose the boundary condition \u03b4j\u03bc = 0; that is, fix the boundary\nvalue of j\u03bc .\n~ = 1 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bd\u03c1 and E\n~ = F\u03bcr , we have\nDefining B\n2\nB \u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd a\u03c1 + \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd j\u03c1 z ,\n\nE \u03bc = j \u03bc z2 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe two sets of boundary conditions then correspond to either setting E\u03bc = 0 while\nleaving a\u03bc unrestricted, or setting B\u03bc = 0 while leaving j\u03bc unrestricted.\nAt this point we note that a\u03bc , j\u03bc are naturally identified, respectively, with a dynamical gauge field and a global current in the boundary. In accordance with this\nidentification, eq. (2.11) and the usual AdS/CF T prescription shows each field to\nhave the correct scaling dimension for this interpretation: for a gauge field \u2206(a\u03bc ) = 1,\nwhile for a global current \u2206(j\u03bc ) = 2. Therefore, the quantization E\u03bc = 0 is dual to a\nboundary CFT where the U(1) gauge field is dynamical; while the quantization B\u03bc = 0\nis dual to a boundary CFT where the U(1) is ungauged and is instead a global symmetry. Furthermore, as discussed in [18] for the scalar counterpart, once the improved\naction is taken into account the two quantizations are Legendre transformations of one\nanother [70], as can be seen by e.g. computing the free energy in each case.\nOne can consider electric-magnetic duality in the bulk theory, which exchanges E\u03bc \u2194\n\nB\u03bc thus exchanging the two boundary conditions for the AdS4 gauge field quantization.\nThis action translates in the boundary theory into the so-called S operation [22]. This\nis an operation on three-dimensional CFTs with a global U(1) symmetry, taking one\nsuch CFT to another. In addition, it is possible to construct a T operation, which\namounts, from the bulk perspective, to a shift of the bulk \u03b8-angle by 2\u03c0. Following\n[22], we can be more precise in defining these actions in the boundary CFT. Starting\n12\n\n\fwith a three-dimensional CFT with a global U(1) current J \u03bc , one can couple this global\ncurrent to a background gauge field A resulting in the action S[A]. The S operation\nthen promotes A to a dynamical gauge field and adds a BF coupling of A to a new\nbackground field B, while the T operation instead adds a CS term for the background\n\ngauge field A:\n\n1\nS : S[A] \u2192 S[A] +\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nB \u2227 dA ,\n\n1\nT : S[A] \u2192 S[A] +\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nA \u2227 dA . (2.17)\n\nAs shown in [22], these two operations generate the group SL(2, Z).5 In turn, as\ndiscussed above, the S and T operations have the bulk interpretation of exchanging\nE\u03bc \u2194 B\u03bc and shifting the bulk \u03b8-angle by 2\u03c0, respectively. It is important to stress\n\nthat these actions on the bulk theory change the boundary conditions. Because of this,\nthe dual CFTs living on the boundary are different.\n2.3.2\n\nBoundary conditions and sources for gauge fields: M5 branes in toric\nmanifolds\n\nWe are interested in gauge symmetries in AdS4 associated to the topology of Y ; that\nis, arising from KK reductions as in (2.10). All Kaluza-Klein modes, and hence their\ndual operators, carry zero charge under these b2 (Y ) U(1) symmetries. However, there\nare operators associated to wrapped M branes that do carry charge under this group.\nIn particular, an M5 brane wrapped on a five-manifold \u03a35 \u2282 Y , such that the cone\n\nC(\u03a35 ) is a complex divisor in the K\u00e4hler cone C(Y ), is supersymmetric and leads to a\nBPS particle propagating in AdS4 . Since the M5 brane is a source for G, this particle\nis electrically charged under the b2 (Y ) massless U(1) gauge fields AI . One might also\nconsider M2 branes wrapped on two-cycles in Y . However, such wrapped M2 branes are\nsupersymmetric only if the cone C(\u03a32 ) over the two-submanifold \u03a32 \u2282 Y is calibrated\nin the Calabi-Yau cone, and there are no such calibrating three-forms. Thus these\nparticles, although topologically stable, are not BPS. They are magnetically charged\nunder the U(1)b2 (Y ) gauge fields in AdS4 [28].\nAs discussed above, the AdS/CF T duality instructs us to choose, for each U(1)\ngauge field, a set of boundary conditions where either E\u03bc or B\u03bc vanishes. Clearly,\nonly the latter possibility allows for the existence of the SUSY electric M5 branes,\notherwise forbidden by the boundary conditions. In turn, this quantization leaves, in\n5\n\nEven though we are explicitly discussing the effect of SL(2, Z) on the vector fields, since these\nare part of a whole Betti multiplet we expect a similar action on the other fields of the multiplet. We\nleave this investigation for future work.\n\n13\n\n\fthe boundary theory, the U(1) symmetry as a global symmetry. Therefore, in this\ncase we should expect to find operators in the field theory that are charged under the\nglobal baryonic symmetries and dual to the M5 brane states. We turn to this point\nin the next section. We note that, with this choice of boundary condition, the r\u00f4le\nof the Betti multiplets is very similar to their AdS5 counterparts, giving rise to global\nbaryonic symmetries in the boundary theory, and hence motivating the use of the same\nname in the case at hand.\nFor toric manifolds there is a canonical set of such wrapped M5 brane states, where\nC(\u03a35 ) are taken to be the toric divisors. Each such state leads to a corresponding\ndual chiral primary operator that is charged under the U(1)b2 (Y ) global symmetries\nand will also have definite charge under the U(1)4 flavour group dual to the isometries\nof Y . We refer the reader to the standard literature for a thorough introduction to\ntoric geometry. However, the basic idea is simple to state. The cone C(Y ) fibres over\na polyhedral cone in R4 with generic fibre U(1)4 . This polyhedral cone is by definition\nT\na convex set of the form {x * v\u03b1 \u2265 0} \u2282 R4 , where v\u03b1 \u2208 Z4 are integer vectors. This\n\nset of vectors is precisely the set of charge vectors specifying the U(1) subgroups of\nU(1)4 that have complex codimension one fixed point sets. These fixed point sets are,\nby definition, the toric divisors referred to above. The Calabi-Yau condition implies\nthat, with a suitable choice of basis, we can write v\u03b1 = (1, w\u03b1 ), with w\u03b1 \u2208 Z3 . If we\nplot these latter points in R3 and take their convex hull, we obtain the toric diagram.\n\nFigure 1: The toric diagram for C(Q111 ).\nFor the Q111 example the toric divisors are given by taking \u03a35 = {\u03b8i = 0} or\n\u03a35 = {\u03b8i = \u03c0}, for any i = 1, 2, 3, which are 6 five-manifolds in Y . The toric diagram\n14\n\n\ffor Q111 is shown in Figure 1, where one sees clearly these 6 toric divisors as the 6\nexternal vertices. Notice that for Q111 the full isometry group may be used to rotate\n{\u03b8i = 0} into {\u03b8i = \u03c0}, specifically using the ith copy of SU(2) in the SU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)R\nisometry group. In fact these two five-manifolds are two points in an S 2 family of such\nfive-manifolds related via the isometry group. Similar comments apply also to Q222 .\n\n3\n\nBaryonic symmetries in QCS theories\n\nIn the previous section we discussed the r\u00f4le of vector fields in AdS4 . In particular, we\nhave shown that there is a choice of boundary conditions where the Betti multiplets\ncorresponding to (2.10) are dual to global currents in the boundary theory. From the\nbulk perspective, this translates into the possibility of having electric M5 brane states\nin the theory, in a consistent manner. On general grounds, we expect these states to be\ndual to certain operators in the boundary theory charged under the global U(1)b2 (Y ) .\nIn this section we turn to a more precise field theoretic description of this. We begin\nwith a brief review of the U(N) theories considered in the literature, before turning to\nour C(Q111 ) example and considering the r\u00f4le of the abelian symmetries in this case.\n\n3.1\n\nU (N ) QCS theories\n\nQ\nLet us start by considering the G\na=1 U(Na ) theories. The Lagrangian, in N = 2\nsuperspace notation, for a theory containing an arbitrary number of bifundamentals\n \u0304 b ) under the (a, b)-th gauge groups and a choice of\nXab in the representation (\u0003a , \u0003\nsuperpotential W , reads\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nZ\nZ1\nG\nX\nX \u2020\nka\nXab e\u2212Va Xab eVb +\nL=\nd4 \u03b8 Tr \uf8f0\ndtVa D\u0304 \u03b1 (etVa D\u03b1 e\u2212tVa )\uf8fb\n2\u03c0\na=1\nXab\n0\nZ\n+ d2 \u03b8 W (Xab ) + c.c. .\n(3.1)\nHere ka \u2208 Z are the CS levels for the vector multiplet Va . For future convenience we\n\ndefine k = gcd{ka }.\n\nThe classical vacuum moduli space (VMS) is determined in general by the following\n\n15\n\n\fequations [9, 10]\n\u2202Xab W = 0 ,\n\u03bca := \u2212\n\nG\nX\nb=1\n\nXba \u2020 Xba +\n\nG\nX\n\nXac Xac \u2020 =\n\nc=1\n\nka \u03c3a\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c3a Xab \u2212 Xab \u03c3b = 0 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03c3a is the scalar component of Va . Following [9], upon diagonalization of the\nfields using SU(N) rotations, one can focus on the branch where \u03c3a = \u03c3, \u2200a, so that\nP\nthe last equation is immediately satisfied.6 Under the assumption that G\na=1 ka = 0,\nthe equations for the moment maps \u03bca boil down to a system of G \u2212 2 independent\n\nequations for the bifundamental fields, analogous to D-term equations. Since for toric\nsuperpotentials the set of F-flat configurations, determining the so-called master space,\nis of dimension G + 2, upon imposing the G \u2212 2 D-terms and dividing by the associated\ngauge symmetries we have a dimC M = 4 moduli space M where the M2 branes move.\n\nHowever, due to the peculiarities of the CS kinetic terms, extra care has to be taken\nwith the diagonal part of the gauge symmetry. At a generic point of the moduli space\n\nthe gauge group is broken to N copies of U(1)G . The diagonal gauge field BG =\nPG\na=1 Aa is completely decoupled from the matter fields, and only appears coupled to\nP\nBG\u22121 = k \u22121 G\na=1 ka Aa through\nZ\nk\nS(BG ) =\n(BG\u22121 )\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (GG )\u03bd\u03c1 .\n(3.3)\n4\u03c0 G\nSince BG appears only through its field strength, it can be dualized into a scalar \u03c4 .\nFollowing the standard procedure, it is easy to see that integrating out GG = dBG sets\nBG\u22121 =\n\nG\nd\u03c4 ,\nk\n\nsuch that the relevant part of the action becomes a total derivative\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c4\nGG .\nS(BG ) = d\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nAround a charge n \u2208 Z monopole in the diagonal U(1) gauge field BG we then have\nR\nGG = 2\u03c0 G n, so that \u03c4 must have period 2\u03c0/G in order for the above phase to\nbe unobservable [9]. Gauge transformations of BG\u22121 then allow one to gauge-fix \u03c4\n6\n\nWe stress that there might be, and indeed even in the Q111 example there are, other branches of\nthe moduli space where the condition \u03c3a = \u03c3 for all a is not met, and yet still the bosonic potential\nis minimized.\n\n16\n\n\fto a particular value via (3.4), but this still leaves a residual discrete set of Zk gauge\nsymmetries that leave this gauge choice invariant. The space of solutions to (3.2) is then\nP\nquotiented by gauge transformations where the parameters \u03b8a satisfy G\na=1 ka \u03b8a = 0,\ntogether with the residual discrete Zk gauge transformations generated by \u03b8a = 2\u03c0/k\nfor all a. Altogether this leads to a U(1)G\u22122 \u00d7 Zk quotient. We refer to [9] for further\ndiscussion, and to [27] for a discussion in the context of the Q111 theory in particular.\n\nAn alternative point of view has recently appeared in the literature [11, 12], in\nwhich the existence of two special monopole operators T, T\u0303 is noted. These monopole\noperators, which have charges \u00b1(k1 , * * * , kG ) respectively under each gauge group, are\nconjectured to satisfy a relation in the chiral ring of the form T T\u0303 = 1 . In this approach\nthe moduli space is defined as the chiral ring of the abelian theory enhanced by the\noperators T, T\u0303 , together with the constraint.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nThe C(Q111) theory\nThe theory and its moduli space\n\nA field theory candidate dual to M2 branes probing C(Q111 )/Zk was proposed in [26]\nand further studied in [27]. The proposal in those references is a U(N)4 Chern-Simons\ngauge theory with CS levels (k, k, \u2212k, \u2212k), with matter content summarized by the\nquiver in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: The quiver diagram for a conjectured dual of C(Q111 ).\nIn addition, there is a superpotential given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nW = Tr C2 B1 A1 B2 C1 A2 \u2212 C2 B1 A2 B2 C1 A1 .\n\n(3.6)\n\nAs expected for a field theory dual to N point-like branes moving in C(Q111 )/Zk , the\n\nmoduli space contains a branch which is the symmetric product of N copies of this\n17\n\n\fconical singularity. To see this, let us begin with the abelian theory in which all the\ngauge groups are U(1). As shown in [27], after integrating out the auxiliary \u03c3 scalar\nthe geometric branch of the moduli space with k = 1 is described by G \u2212 2 = 2 D-term\nequations. Recalling the special r\u00f4le played by BG\u22121 = B3 , BG = B4 , it is useful to\nintroduce the following basis for the U(1) gauge fields:\n\n1\n1\nAI = (A1 \u2212 A2 + A3 \u2212 A4 ) , AII = (A1 \u2212 A2 \u2212 A3 + A4 ) ,\n2\n2\nB3 = A1 + A2 \u2212 A3 \u2212 A4 , B4 = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 .\nThen the two D-terms to impose are those for AI , AII . In turn, the charge matrix is\nU(1)I\nU(1)II\nU(1)B3\nU(1)B4\n\nA1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2\n1\n1\n0\n0 \u22121 \u22121\n\u22121 \u22121 1\n1\n0\n0 .\n0\n0 \u22122 2 \u22122 2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n(3.7)\n\nNotice the appeareance of the SU(2)3 global symmetry, under which the pairs Ai , Bi ,\nCi transform as doublets under each of the respective factors.\nSince for the abelian theory the superpotential is identically zero, one can determine\nthe abelian moduli space by constructing the gauge-invariants with respect to the gauge\ntransformations for AI , AII . Borrowing the results from [27], for CS level k = 1 these\nare\nw1 = A1 B2 C1 ,\nw5 = A1 B1 C1 ,\n\nw2 = A2 B1 C2 ,\nw6 = A2 B1 C1 ,\n\nw3 = A1 B1 C2 ,\nw7 = A1 B2 C2 ,\n\nw4 = A2 B2 C1 ,\n(3.8)\nw8 = A2 B2 C2 .\n\nOne can then check explicitly that these satisfy the 9 relations defining C(Q111 ) as an\n\naffine variety:\n\nw1 w2 \u2212 w3 w4 = w1 w2 \u2212 w5 w8 = w1 w2 \u2212 w6 w7 = 0 ,\nw1 w3 \u2212 w5 w7 = w1 w6 \u2212 w4 w5 = w1 w8 \u2212 w4 w7 = 0 ,\nw2 w4 \u2212 w6 w8 = w2 w5 \u2212 w3 w6 = w2 w7 \u2212 w3 w8 = 0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis is an affine toric variety, with toric diagram given by Figure 1. Indeed, we also\nnotice that for the abelian theory the description of the moduli space as a U(1)2 K\u00e4hler\nquotient of C6 with coordinates {Ai , Bi , Ci } is precisely the minimal gauged linear sigma\nmodel (GLSM) description. Thus the 6 toric divisors in Figure 1, discussed in \u00a72.3,\nare defined by {Ai = 0}, {Bi = 0}, {Ci = 0}, i = 1, 2.\n18\n\n\fFor CS level k > 1 one obtains an N = 2 supersymmetric Zk \u2282 U(1)BG\u22121 orbifold of\nC(Q111 ). Notice that {wi | i = 1, . . . , 4} are invariant under this action, while {w5 , w6}\nand {w7 , w8} are rotated with equal and opposite phase. On the other hand, for the\nnon-abelian theory with N > 1 it was shown in [27] that for large k, where the use\n\nof still poorly-understood monopole operators is evaded, upon using the F-terms of\nthe full non-abelian superpotential (3.6) the chiral ring matches that expected for the\ncorresponding orbifold. In this case the chiral primaries at the non-abelian level are\njust the usual gauge-invariants given by\nTr\n\nr\n\u0010Y\n\na=1\n\nXi\u00b1a\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\nwhere Xi+ = Ai C2 B1 ,\n\nXi\u2212 = Ai B2 C1 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nAn important subtlety in this theory is that U(1)BG\u22121 does not act freely on Q111 : it\nfixes two disjoint copies of S 3 inside Q111 , as explained in [11]. Indeed, using (3.7) one\nsees that the corresponding two cones C2 = C(S 3 ) are parametrized respectively by\n{w1 , w4 } and {w2 , w3 }, with in each case all other wi = 0. Thus for k > 1 the horizon\n\nY = Q111 /Zk has orbifold singularities in codimension four. This means that the\nSUGRA approximation cannot be trusted for k > 1. In fact these are Ak\u22121 singularities\n\nwhich can support \"fractional\" M2 branes wrapping the collapsed cycles, and one\nexpects an SU(k) gauge theory to be supported on these S 3 s. A different perspective\ncan be obtained by interpreting U(1)BG\u22121 as the M-theory circle and reducing to Type\n\nIIA. This results in k D6 branes wrapping these two S 3 submanifolds. From now on\nwe will therefore assume that k = 1.\n3.2.2\n\nGauged versus global abelian subgroups and SL(2, Z)\n\nAt k = 1 the orbifold identification due to the CS terms is trivial. Indeed, in this case\nthere is no real distinction between U(N) and SU(N)\u00d7U(1) gauge groups, as discussed\nin [3, 24, 25] for the ABJM theory and orbifolds of it. We shall argue that ungauging\nsome of the U(1)s is dual to a particular choice of boundary conditions on the gravity\nside. That is, we apply the general discussion in \u00a72.3 to the b2 (Q111 ) = 2 U(1) gauge\n\nfields, and argue that the associated U(1) symmetries are those in SU(N) \u00d7 U(1), for\nappropriate gauge group factors. This raises the important problem of how to identify\nthe relevant two U(1) symmetries dual to the Betti multiplets in the QCS theory\nproposed above. The key is to recall that the boundary conditions which amount to\nungauging these U(1)s in turn allow for the existence of supersymmetric M5 branes\non the gravity side. As discussed in \u00a72.3, from an algebro-geometric point of view the\n19\n\n\fcorresponding divisors are easy to identify. In turn we notice that, for the abelian\ntheory, the fields {Ai , Bi , Ci } are also the minimal GLSM coordinates. Setting each to\nzero therefore gives one of the 6 toric divisors that may be wrapped by an M5 brane.\nThe charges of the resulting M5 brane states under U(1)b2 (Y ) are then the same as\n\nthe charges of these fields under the U(1)I \u00d7 U(1)II we quotient by in forming the\nabelian moduli space \u2013 this was shown for the D3 brane case in [19], and the same\nargument applies here also. This strongly suggests that the gauge symmetries U(1)I ,\nU(1)II should in fact be dual to the Betti multiplets discussed in \u00a72.3.\n\nOnce we have identified the relevant abelian symmetries, we can consider acting with\nthe S and T operations. We schematically write the action of the U(N)4 Q111 theory\n(which we will denote as SU ), separating the U(1) sector from the rest, as\nZ\nZ\nSU \u223c B3 \u2227 dB4 + AI \u2227 dAII + LR ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nR\n\nLR stands for the remaining terms. We can then consider a theory without\nR\nR\nthe gauge fields AI , AII , constructed schematically as SSU = B3 \u2227 dB4 + LR . By\nconstruction, this theory has exactly 2 global symmetries satisfying all the properties\nexpected as dual to Betti multiplets. Following [22], we can introduce a background\nwhere\n\ngauge field for one of them, which we can call AI . Then, as reviewed in \u00a72.3, the\nS-operation amounts to regarding this field as dynamical, while at the same time\nintroducing a coupling to another background field CI as\nZ\nSSU \u2192 SSU [AI ] + CI \u2227 dAI .\n\n(3.12)\n\nWe can introduce yet another background gauge field AII for the second global symmetry and perform yet another S-operation. However, this time we will choose to regard\nCI \u2212 AII as the background gauge field on which to act with the S-generator. This\nresults in\n\nSSU [AI ] +\n\nZ\n\nCI \u2227 dAI \u2192 SSU [AI , AII ] +\n\nZ\n\nCI \u2227 dAI +\n\nZ\n\nCII \u2227 d(CI \u2212 AII ) . (3.13)\n\nIntegrating by parts yields\nSSU [AI , AII ] +\n\nZ\n\nCI \u2227 d(CII + AI ) \u2212\n\nZ\n\nCII \u2227 dAII .\n\n(3.14)\n\nSince CI only appears linearly, its functional integral gives rise to a delta functional\nsetting CII = \u2212AI , which leads to an action of the precise form (3.11). We have\n20\n\n\ftherefore been able to establish a connection between a theory where the gauge group\nis U(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)4 , and whose action is SSU , with the original U(N)4 theory, whose\n\naction is given by SU , via repeated action with the S-operation.\n\nMore generally, the whole of SL(2, Z) will act on the boundary conditions for the\nbulk gauge fields, leading in general to an infinite orbit of CFTs for each U(1) gauge\nsymmetry in AdS4 . This is a rich structure that deserves considerable further investigation. In this paper, however, we will content ourselves to study the particular choice\nof boundary conditions described by the SSU theory. Since the dual to the S operation\n\nis the exchange of the E\u03bc \u2194 B\u03bc boundary conditions, we expect the gravity dual to\nthe SSU theory to still be AdS4 \u00d7 Q111 , but with an appropriate choice of boundary\nconditions. In turn, these boundary conditions allow for the existence of the electrically\ncharged M5 branes which we used to identify the symmetries. These M5 branes would\n\nnot be allowed in the quantization E\u03bc = 0, which in turn would be dual to a CFT\nwhere the corresponding U(1) factors would remain gauged. In agreement, the dual\noperators which we will propose below would not be gauge-invariant in that case.\nLet us now consider the effect of the U(1)2 \u00d7SU(N) gauge group on the construction\n\nof the moduli space. The diagonalization of the \u03c3a auxiliary fields in the equations\ndefining the moduli space (3.2) relies on the non-abelian part of the gauge symmetry,\nand therefore it applies even if we consider ungauging some of the diagonal U(1) factors.\nMore crucially, in order to obtain the correct four-fold moduli space we needed the\nS(B4 ) piece (3.3) of the CS action so that, upon dualizing the B4 field, the dual scalar\n\n\u03c4 is gauge-fixed via gauge transformations of B3 . Thus provided we leave B4 and B3\ngauged, with the same CS action, all of this discussion is unaffected if we ungauge the\n\nremaining U(1)I , U(1)II . Correspondingly, we will still have the 8 gauge-invariants\n(3.8), which will give rise to the same 9 equations defining C(Q111 ) as a non-complete\n\nintersection as \"mesonic\" moduli space. The remarks on the non-abelian chiral ring\nelements spanned by (3.10) are also unchanged. However, with only a U(1)B3 \u00d7U(1)B4 \u00d7\nSU(N)4 gauge symmetry we also have additional chiral primary operators, charged\nunder the now global U(1)I , U(1)II . Indeed, we have the following \"baryonic\" type\noperators:\nBAI1 ...IN\nBBi\nBCi\n\n1 i1 ***iN\n\u01eb\n\u01ebj1 ***jN (AI1 )ji11 * * * (AIN )jiNN ,\nN!\n1 i1 ***iN\ni\u22121\n\u01eb\n\u01ebj1 ***jN (Bi )ji11 * * * (Bi )jiNN ei (\u22121) N \u03c4 ,\n=\nN!\n1 i1 ***iN\ni\u22121\n=\n\u01eb\n\u01ebj1 ***jN (Ci )ji11 * * * (Ci )jiNN ei (\u22121) N \u03c4 .\nN!\n\n=\n\n21\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fIn particular, for the 6 fields in the quiver there is a canonical set of 6 baryonic operators given by determinants of these fields, dressed by appropriate powers of the\ndisorder operators ei\u03c4 to obtain gauge-invariants under B3 . These operators are in 1-1\ncorrespondence with the toric divisors in the geometry. This is precisely the desired\nmapping between baryonic operators in the field theory and M5 branes wrapping such\ntoric submanifolds, with one M5 brane state for each divisor. Indeed, the charges of\nthese operators under the two baryonic U(1)s are\n\nU(1)I\nU(1)II\n\nBAI1 ..IN\nN\n\u2212N\n\nBBi BCi\n0 \u2212N .\nN\n0\n\nThese are precisely the charges of M5 branes, wrapped on the five-manifolds corresponding to the divisors {Ai = 0}, {Bi = 0}, {Ci = 0}, under the two U(1)b2 (Y )\nsymmetries in AdS4 . Indeed, recall that the two two-cycles in Q111 may be taken to\nbe the anti-diagonal S 2 s in two factors of CP1 \u00d7 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , at \u03c8 = 0. Let us choose\nthese to be the anti-diagonal in the first and third factor, and second and first factor,\nrespectively. The charge of an M5 brane wrapped on a five-cycle \u03a35 \u2282 Y under each\n\nU(1) is then the intersection number of \u03a35 with each corresponding two-cycle. Thus\nwith this basis choice, the charges of the operator associated to an M5 brane wrapped\non the base of one of the 6 toric divisors {Ai = 0}, {Bi = 0}, {Ci = 0} are precisely\nthose listed in the above table.\nBeing chiral primary, the conformal dimensions of these operators are given by\nN \u2206[X] = N R[X], R[X] being the R-charge of the field X. The conformal dimension\n\nof an M5 brane wrapping a supersymmetric five-cycle \u03a35 \u2282 Y is given by the general\nformula [45]\nN\u03c0vol(\u03a35 )\n.\n(3.16)\n\u2206[\u03a35 ] =\n6vol(Y )\n4\n\nThese volumes are easily computed for the Q111 metric (2.8): vol(Q111 ) = \u03c08 , vol(\u03a35 ) =\n\u03c03\n, where \u03a35 is any of the 6 toric five-cycles. From this one obtains \u2206[\u03a35 ] = N3 in\n4\neach case, giving conformal dimensions \u2206[X] = 13 for each field. With this R-charge\nassignment we see that the superpotential (3.6) has R-charge 2, precisely as it must\nat a superconformal fixed point. Indeed, the converse argument was applied in [46] to\nobtain this R-charge assignment. We thus regard this as further evidence in support\nof our claim in this section, as well as further support for these theories as candidate\nSCFT duals to AdS4 \u00d7 Q111 .\n22\n\n\f3.3\n\nQCS theories dual to isolated toric Calabi-Yau four-fold\nsingularities\n\nWe would like to apply the preceding discussion to more general N = 2 CS-matter\ntheories dual to M2 branes probing Calabi-Yau four-fold cones. With the exception of\nC4 , the apex of the cone always corresponds to a singular point p in the toric variety.\nThe simplest class of such singularities occurs when this singular point p is isolated;\nthat is, when no other singular loci intersect it. In this case the base of the cone Y is a\nsmooth Sasakian seven-manifold. The condition for the singular point p to be isolated\nwas given in [47] and interpreted in terms of the toric diagram in [48].\nAn additional ingredient is the possible presence of vanishing six-cycles at the tip of\nthe cone. In terms of the toric data, these six-cycles are signalled by internal lattice\npoints in the toric diagram. These codimension 2 cycles, in very much the same spirit\nas their four-cycle Type IIB counterparts (see e.g. [49]), represent a further degree of\ncomplexity. We postpone the analysis of geometries with exceptional six-cycles to \u00a75.\n\nWe study such isolated Calabi-Yau singularities without vanishing six-cycles in more\n\ndetail in \u00a7A, in particular classifying the singularities with 4 or 5 external vertices in\nthe toric diagram. In the cases where a Lagrangian description of the M2 brane theory\nexists, it turns out that for all these cases one can construct an appropriate toric\nsuperpotential, so that there is a toric gauge theory which realizes at the abelian level\nthe minimal GLSM. This toric gauge theory has b2 (Y ) + 2 gauge group factors, and\ncan be promoted to have U(N) gauge groups. Such quiver Chern-Simons theories have\nbeen considered in the past in [3, 26, 48].\nWe would like to generalize our proposal to this simplest class of isolated singularities with no vanishing six-cycles. Indeed, we expect that a similar sequence of T and\nS operations amounts to ungauging of precisely b2 (Y ) U(1) factors. In very much the\n\nsame spirit as in the C(Q111 ) example, this should correspond to a particular choice of\nboundary conditions in the dual AdS4 . Furthermore, we conjecture the gauge group to\nbe U(1)2 \u00d7SU(N)b2 (Y )+2 , the two U(1) factors being those corresponding to the BG and\nBG\u22121 gauge fields. This way we are naturally left with b2 (Y ) global U(1) symmetries\nwhich exactly correspond to the b2 (Y ) expected U(1) baryonic symmetries. Furthermore, the M5 branes would be naturally identified with the corresponding baryonic\noperators, constructed in a similar manner as in the C(Q111 ) example.\n\nAs a final remark, for the Q111 case one can see that the total moduli space can\nbe described as two extra complex directions that are fibred over the mesonic moduli\n23\n\n\fspace. The resulting variety is often called the master space. More generally one can\nsee that the moduli spaces of the class of theories that we described above can be\ndescribed as b2 (Y ) baryonic directions fibred over the mesonic moduli space. This is\nimplied by the fact that the number of gauge nodes in these theories is b2 (Y ) + 2.\n\n4\n\nGravity duals of baryonic symmetry breaking\n\nIn \u00a72.3 we explained that for each U(1) gauge field in AdS4 , arising from reduction of\nC6 along five-cycles in Y , there are two different AdS quantizations: one of these gives\nrise to a conserved U(1) current in the dual CFT, while the other instead gives rise to\na dynamical U(1) gauge field. As discussed in \u00a72.3, in this paper we content ourselves\nwith studying the quantization which is more closely analogous to the case in Type IIB\nstring theory, in which the b2 (Y ) baryonic U(1) gauge fields (2.10) in AdS4 are dual\nto conserved currents in the dual SCFT. As we have argued, in this theory M5 branes\n\nwrapped on supersymmetric cycles in Y should appear as chiral primary baryonic-type\noperators in the dual SCFT. Indeed, at least for toric theories with appropriate smooth\nsupergravity horizons Y we expect the dual SCFT to be described by a QCS theory\nwith gauge group U(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)b2 (Y )+2 . The M5 brane states are then the usual\ngauge-invariant determinant-like operators in these theories, as we discussed in detail\nfor the Q111 theory in the previous section.\n\nWe may then study the gravity duals to vacua in which the b2 (Y ) global U(1)s are\n(spontaneously) broken. On general grounds, these should correspond to supergravity\nsolutions constructed from resolutions of the corresponding cone over Y . The baryonic\noperators are charged under the global baryonic symmetries, and vacua in which these\noperators obtain a VEV lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. By giving this VEV\nwe pick a point in the moduli space of the theory, which at the same time introduces a\nscale and thus an RG flow, whose endpoint will be a different SCFT. The supergravity\ndual of this RG flow was first discussed in the Type IIB context by Klebanov-Witten\n[18], and to some extent in the M-theory context in [48]. In this section we begin by\ndiscussing in detail these gravity solutions for the case of Q111 . The physics in fact\nvery closely resembles the physics in the Type IIB context. We then describe how to\ngeneralize this discussion for general Calabi-Yau four-fold singularities. In particular,\nwe will obtain a general formula for M5 brane condensates, or indeed more generally\nstill a formula for the on-shell action of a wrapped brane in a warped Calabi-Yau\nbackground. Essentially this formula appeared in [50], where it was checked in some\n24\n\n\fexplicit examples. Here we provide a general proof of this formula.\nWe emphasize that the interpretation of the gravity backgrounds considered in this\nsection is only for the special choice of dual CFT in which the b2 (Y ) baryonic U(1)\ngauge fields in AdS4 are dual to global symmetries in the dual SCFT. More generally,\ndifferent choices of boundary conditions will imply that some, or all, of the M5 brane\nstates considered here are absent. It is then clearly very interesting to ask what is the\ndual field theory interpretation of these gravity backgrounds in such situations. Again,\nwe leave this for future work.\n\n4.1\n\nResolutions of C(Q111)\n\nIn this section we consider the warped resolved gravity backgrounds for Q111 . We\nbegin by discussing this in the context of the GLSM, and then proceed to construct\ncorresponding explicit supergravity solutions.\n4.1.1\n\nAlgebraic analysis\n\nThe toric singularity C(Q111 ) may be described by a GLSM with 6 fields, ai , bi , ci ,\n\ni = 1, 2, and gauge group U(1)2 . This is also the same as the abelian QCS theory\npresented in \u00a73, but without the CS terms. The charge matrix is\nU(1)1\nU(1)2\n\na1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2\n\u22121 \u22121 1 1 0 0 .\n\u22121 \u22121 0 0 1 1\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe singular cone C(Q111 ) is the moduli space of this GLSM where the FI parameters\n\u03b61 = \u03b62 = 0 are both zero. However, more generally we may allow \u03b61 , \u03b62 \u2208 R, leading\n\nto different (partial) resolutions of the singularity. In fact since there are no internal\npoints in the toric diagram in Figure 1, this GLSM in fact describes all possible (partial)\n\nresolutions of the singular cone.\nIt is straightforward to analyse the various cases. Suppose first that \u03b61 , \u03b62 > 0 are\nboth positive. We may write the two D-terms of the GLSM as\n|b1 |2 + |b2 |2 = \u03b61 + |a1 |2 + |a2 |2 > 0 ,\n\n|c1 |2 + |c2 |2 = \u03b62 + |a1 |2 + |a2 |2 > 0 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn particular, for a1 = a2 = 0 we obtain CP1 \u00d7 CP1 where the K\u00e4hler class of each\n\nfactor is proportional to \u03b61 and \u03b62 , respectively. Here bi and ci may be thought of as\n25\n\n\fhomogeneous coordinates on the CP1 s. Altogether, this describes the total space of the\nbundle O(\u22121, \u22121) \u2295 O(\u22121, \u22121) \u2192 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , with a1 , a2 the two fibre coordinates on\nthe C2 fibres.\n\nSuppose instead that \u03b61 < 0. We may then rewrite the D-terms as\n|a1 |2 + |a2 |2 = \u2212\u03b61 + |b1 |2 + |b2 |2 > 0 ,\n|c1 |2 + |c2 |2 = \u03b62 \u2212 \u03b61 + |b1 |2 + |b2 |2 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nProvided also \u03b62 \u2212 \u03b61 > 0, we hence obtain precisely the same geometry as when\n\n\u03b61 , \u03b62 > 0, but with the CP1 \u00d7 CP1 zero section now parametrized by ai and ci and\nwith K\u00e4hler classes proportional to \u2212\u03b61 and \u03b62 \u2212 \u03b61 , respectively. There is a similar\nsituation with \u03b62 < 0 and \u03b61 \u2212 \u03b62 > 0.\n\nFigure 3: The GKZ fan for Q111 is R2 , divided into three cones.\nHence in total there are three different resolutions of C(Q111 ), corresponding to choos-\n\ning which of the three CP1 s in Q111 collapses at the zero section in O(\u22121, \u22121) \u2295\nO(\u22121, \u22121) \u2192 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 . We label these three CP1 s as CP1a , a = 1, 2, 3, which in Q111\n\nare parametrized by ci , bi , ai , respectively. This is shown in Figure 3, which is known\nmore generally as the GKZ fan. Notice there is a \u03a33 permutation symmetry of the\nthree CP1 s in Q111 and the three different resolutions are permuted by this symmetry.\nThe boundary edges between the regions correspond to collapsing another of the\nCP1 s, leading only to a partial resolution of the singularity. Thus, for example, take\n\n26\n\n\f\u03b61 > 0 but \u03b62 = 0. The D-terms are now\n|b1 |2 + |b2 |2 = \u03b61 + |a1 |2 + |a2 |2 > 0 ,\n\n|c1 |2 + |c2 |2 = |a1 |2 + |a2 |2 .\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe second line describes the conifold singularity, which is then fibred over a CP1 ,\nparametrized by the bi , of K\u00e4hler class \u03b61 .\n4.1.2\n\nSupergravity analysis\n\nFor each of the resolutions of C(Q111 ) described above there is a corresponding Ricci-flat\n\nK\u00e4hler metric that is asymptotic to the cone metric over Q111 . More precisely, there\nis a unique such metric for each choice of K\u00e4hler class, or equivalently FI parameter\n\u03b61 , \u03b62 \u2208 R. As we shall discuss later in this section, this is guaranteed by a general\n\ntheorem that has only just been proven in the mathematics literature. However, for\nQ111 these metrics may in fact be written down explicitly. Denoting the (partially)\nresolved Calabi-Yau generically by X, the Calabi-Yau metrics are given by\n3\n\u00112 (2a + r 2 ) \u0010\n\u0011\nX\nr2 \u0010\nds (X) = \u03ba(r) dr + \u03ba(r)\nd\u03c8 +\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i +\nd\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622\n16\n8\ni=1\n\u0011 r2 \u0010\n\u0011\n(2b + r 2 ) \u0010 2\nd\u03b83 + sin2 \u03b83 d\u03c623 +\nd\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ,\n(4.5)\n+\n8\n8\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\nwhere\n\n\u03ba(r) =\n\n(2A\u2212 + r 2 )(2A+ + r 2 )\n,\n(2a + r 2 )(2b + r 2 )\n\na and b are arbitrary constants, and we have also defined\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1\u0010\n2a + 2b \u00b1 4a2 \u2212 10ab + 4b2 .\nA\u00b1 =\n3\n\n(4.6)\n\n(4.7)\n\nOne easily sees that at large r the metric approaches the cone over the Q111 metric (2.8).\nThis way of writing the resolved metric breaks the \u03a33 symmetry, since it singles out the\nCP1 parametrized by (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) as that collapsing at r = 0. Here we have an exceptional\nCP1 \u00d7CP1 , parametrized by (\u03b82 , \u03c62), (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ), with K\u00e4hler classes proportional to a > 0\nand b > 0, respectively. Thus setting {a = 0, b > 0}, or {b = 0, a > 0}, leads to a\n\npartial resolution with a residual CP1 family of conifold singularities at r = 0. We\nshall examine this in more detail below. For further details of this solution we refer\nthe reader to \u00a7B.\n27\n\n\fWe are interested in studying supergravity backgrounds corresponding to M2 branes\nlocalized on one of these resolutions of C(Q111 ). We thus consider the following ansatz\nfor the background sourced by such M2 branes\n\u0001\nds211 = h\u22122/3 ds2 R1,2 + h1/3 ds2 (X) ,\nG = d3 x \u2227 dh\u22121 ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere ds2 (X) is the Calabi-Yau metric (4.5). If we place N spacetime-filling M2 branes\nat a point y \u2208 X, we must then also solve the equation\n(2\u03c0lp )6 N 8\n\u2206x h[y] = \u221a\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 y) ,\ndet gX\n\n(4.9)\n\nfor the warp factor h = h[y]. Here \u2206 is the scalar Laplacian on X. Having the explicit\nform of the metric we can compute this Laplacian and solve for the warp factor to\nobtain the full supergravity solution. This is studied in detail in \u00a7D.\n\nIn the remainder of this subsection let us analyse the simplified case in which we\npartially resolve the cone, setting a = 0 and b > 0. This corresponds to one of the\nboundary lines in the GKZ fan in Figure 3, with the point on the boundary R>0 labelled\nby the metric parameter b > 0. Here one can solve explicitly for the warp factor in\nthe case where we put the N M2 branes at the north pole of the exceptional CP1\nparametrized by (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ); this is the point with coordinates y = {r = 0, \u03b83 = 0}. Notice\nthe choice of north pole is here without loss of generality, due to the SU(2) isometry\nacting on the third copy of CP1 . We denote the corresponding warp factor in this case\nas simply h[y = {r = 0, \u03b83 = 0}] \u2261 h. As shown in \u00a7D.3, h = h(r, \u03b83 ) is then given\nexplicitly in terms of hypergeometric functions by\nh(r, \u03b83 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nHl (r) Pl (cos \u03b83 ) ,\n\nl=0\n\n\u0010 8b \u00113(1+\u03b2)/2\n\u0001\n3\n3\n3\n8b\n1\n+\n\u03b2,\n+\n\u03b2,\n1\n+\n3\u03b2,\n\u2212\n,\nF\n\u2212\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3r\n3r 2\nwhere Pl denotes the lth Legendre polynomial,\nr\n8\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(l) = 1 + l(l + 1) ,\n9\nand the normalization factor Cl is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\n3\u0393( 32 + 23 \u03b2)2 3 3\n(2l + 1) R6 ,\nCl =\n2\u0393(1 + 3\u03b2) 8b\n256 2 6\n(2\u03c0lp )6 N\n=\n\u03c0 Nlp .\nR6 =\n111\n6vol(Q )\n3\nHl (r) = Cl\n\n28\n\n(4.10)\n\n(4.11)\n\n(4.12)\n(4.13)\n\n\fIn the field theory this solution corresponds to breaking one combination of the two\nglobal U(1) baryonic symmetries, rather than both of them. This will become clear in\nthe next subsection. The resolution of the cone can be interpreted in terms of giving an\nexpectation value to a certain operator U in the field theory. This operator is contained\n\nin the same multiplet as the current that generates the broken baryonic symmetry, and\ncouples to the corresponding U(1) gauge field in AdS4 . Since a conserved current has\n\nno anomalous dimension, the dimension of U is uncorrected in going from the classical\ndescription to supergravity [18]. According to the general AdS/CF T prescription [18],\nthe VEV of the operator U is dual to the subleading correction to the warp factor. For\n\nlarge r we can write\n\nh(r, \u03b83 ) \u223c\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nCl\n\nl=0\n\n\u0010 8b \u00113(1+\u03b2)/2\nPl (cos \u03b83 ) .\n3r 2\n\n(4.14)\n\nExpanding the sum we then have\nR6\nh(r, \u03b83 ) \u223c 6\nr\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n18b cos \u03b83\n1+\n+*** .\n5r 2\n\n(4.15)\n\nIn terms of the AdS4 coordinate z = r \u22122 we have that the leading correction is of\norder z, which indicates that the dual operator U is dimension 1. This is precisely\n\nthe expected result, since this operator sits in the same supermultiplet as the broken\nbaryonic current, and thus has a protected dimension of 1. Furthermore, its VEV is\nproportional to b, the metric resolution parameter, which reflects the fact that in the\nconical (AdS) limit in which b = 0 this baryonic current is not broken, and as such\nhUi = 0.\nThe moduli space of the field theory in the new IR is equivalent to the geometry\n\nclose to the branes. Recall that we placed the N M2 branes at the north pole {\u03b83 = 0}\nof the exceptional (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ) sphere at r = 0. Defining \u03c8\u0303 = \u03c8 + \u03c63 and introducing the\nnew radial variables r\u0303 =\nleading order\n\nb\n2\n\n\u03b83 , \u03c1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n3\n2\n\nr, the geometry close to the branes becomes to\n\n2\n\u00112 \u03c12 \u0010\n\u0011\nX\n\u03c12 \u0010\nd\u03c8\u0303 +\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i +\nd\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622\n9\n6\ni=1\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c12 \u0010 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+\nd\u03b81 + sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 + dr\u0303 + r\u0303 d\u03c63 ,\n6\n\nds2 = d\u03c12 +\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhich is precisely the Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric of C(T 11 ) \u00d7 C, in accordance with the\ndiscussion in the previous subsection.\n\n29\n\n\f4.2\n\nHiggsing the Q111 field theory\n\nWe have argued that the warped resolved supergravity solutions described in the previous section are dual to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the SCFT in which the M5\nbrane states appear as baryonic-type operators. Let us study this in more detail in the\nfield theory described in \u00a73. In this SCFT the symmetries U(1)I and U(1)II in (3.7)\n\nare global, rather than gauge, symmetries, with the corresponding conserved currents\ncoupling to the baryonic U(1) gauge fields in AdS4 . By inspection of this charge matrix\n\nwe conclude that it is possible to give a VEV to the Ai , Bi and Ci fields. These VEVs\nthen break the corresponding baryonic U(1) symmetries. In particular, by giving a\nVEV to any pair of fields (As, Bs or Cs) we break only one particular U(1) baryonic\nsymmetry, leaving another combination unbroken. In this section we will examine the\nresulting Higgsings of the gauge theory obtained by giving VEVs to different pairs of\nfields, and compare with the gravity results of the previous section.\nAs explained in \u00a72, at each of the two poles for each copy of CP1 in the K\u00e4hlerEinstein base of Q111 , there is a supersymmetric five-cycle that may be wrapped by an\nM5 brane. Altogether these are 6 M5 brane states, corresponding to the toric divisors\nof C(Q111 ). Each pair are acted on by one of the SU(2) factors in the isometry group\nSU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)R , rotating one into the other. Quantizing the BPS particles in AdS4\n\none obtains dual baryonic-type operators given by (3.15). In particular, consider the\nM5 branes that sit at a point on the copy of CP1 = S 2 with coordinates (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ). In\nthe next section we will compute the VEV of these M5 brane operators in the partially\nresolved gravity background described by (4.10), showing that the baryonic operator\ndual to the M5 brane at \u03b83 = 0 vanishes, while that at the opposite pole \u03b83 = \u03c0 is nonzero and proportional to the resolution parameter b (see equation (4.26)). Considering\nthe A fields in the field theory this corresponds to the fact that, after breaking the\nbaryonic symmetry by giving diagonal VEVs to these fields, it is possilbe to use the\nSU(2) flavour symmetry to find one combination of A fields with zero VEV, and an\northogonal combination with non-vanishing VEV. Let us assume for example that\nhA1 i = 0 and hA2 i = b IN \u00d7N . Thus only one baryonic operator in (3.15) has nonvanishing VEV, namely hBA2 i = bN \u2206A2 .7 This situation was analyzed in [27], where\nit was shown that the effective field theory in the IR has CS quiver\n7\n\nAs anticipated in \u00a73, at the IR superconformal fixed point the dimensions of the chiral fields\nare expected to be different from the free field fixed point. That is why generically the VEV of the\nbaryonic operator is hBA2 i = bN \u2206A2 .\n\n30\n\n\fwith superpotential\n\u0010\n\u0011\nW = Tr \u03a6 C2 B1 B2 C1 \u2212 B2 C1 C2 B1 .\n\n(4.17)\n\nAs shown in [27], the moduli space of this theory is indeed C(T 11 ) \u00d7C. This is of course\n\nexpected from the gravity analysis of equation (4.16). Any other VEV for the A fields\ncorresponds to placing the M2 branes on SU(2)-equivalent points on the blown-up CP1 ,\nand therefore results in the same near horizon geometry.\nThe manifest symmetry exhibited by the Lagrangian of the Q111 field theory is\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)R , which is only a subgroup of the full SU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)R symmetry which\nis expected from the isometry of the Q111 manifold. Therefore, in contrast to the\nsituation with the A fields, we see that different VEVs for the pairs of B or C fields\nresult in different theories in the IR. Giving a non-vanishing VEV to C1 and C2 , for\nexample, results in the CS quiver\n\nwith superpotential\n\u0010\n\nW = Tr A2 B1 B2 A1 \u2212 B2 A2 A1 B1\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhile when the VEV of only one field is non-vanishing we instead obtain the CS quiver\n\n31\n\n\fwith superpotential\n\u0010\n\nW = Tr C2 A2 B1 B2 A1 \u2212 A2 A1 B1 B2\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(4.19)\n\nOf course, both cases correspond geometrically to blowing up the same CP1 , as can be\nseen from the explicit construction of the field theory moduli space. However, recall\nthat the position of the M2 branes depends on the VEVs of C1 and C2 . While in\nthe gravity picture all locations on the exceptional CP1 are SU(2)-equivalent, in the\nfield theory since only part of the global symmetery is manifest we obtain different\ntheories for different VEVs. The supergravity analysis hence suggests that the theories\nobtained in the IR above are dual. Indeed, one can check that the moduli spaces of\nthese theories are the same, the details appearing in [51], for example.\nThe QCS theory for C(T 11 ) \u00d7 C in (4.18) has zero CS levels, and there is therefore no\ntunable coupling parameter in this theory. This may be understood as follows. After\nblowing up the cone to the partial resolution and placing the stack of M2 branes at\na residual singular point on the exceptional CP1 , the tangent cone geometry at this\npoint is C(T 11 ) \u00d7 C. In the field theory the S 1 that rotates the copy of C corresponds\nto the M-theory circle. Shrinking the size of this circle in the M-theory supergravity\nsolution corresponds to a Type IIA limit describing a black D2 brane solution with no\n\nsmooth near horizon. We should therefore not expect to find a dual field theory with\na weak coupling limit. On the other hand, in the remaining two field theories (4.17),\n(4.19) for C(T 11 ) \u00d7 C described in this section the M-theory circle involves a U(1) that\nacts also on C(T 11 ).8\n\nAs a final comment in this section, notice that in general we will have an infinite\nset of CFTs dual to the Q111 geometry, with different boundary conditions on the\n\nbaryonic gauge fields (2.10) in AdS4 . From our earlier discussion, these will have the\nsame QCS theories in the SU(N) sector, but different U(1) sectors. In particular, in\ngeneral different combinations of the diagonal U(1)s in U(N) may be gauged, and with\ndifferent U(1) CS levels from the levels ka of the SU(N) factors. These U(1) sectors\nwill in general behave differently under Higgsing. In particular, a global U(1) can\nbe sponteneously broken, while a gauged U(1) can be Higgsed. It will be interesting\nto investigate this general structure in both the field theory and dual supergravity\nsolutions, although we leave this for future work, focusing instead on the U(1)2 \u00d7\nSU(N)4 theory.\n8\n\nThe M-theory circle can be deduced by computing the Zk orbifold action on the moduli space in\neach case.\n\n32\n\n\f4.3\n\nBaryonic condensates and M5 branes in the Q111 solution\n\nIn the previous section we discussed the RG flow triggered by giving a VEV to one\nof the fields, and hence baryonic operators, in the Q111 theory with gauge group\nU(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)4 . In this section we calculate the VEV of this baryonic operator\nin the corresponding gravity solution described by (4.10). In order to do this we follow\nthe analogous calculation in the Type IIB context, discussed in [21, 29]. In this prescription, to determine the VEV of a baryonic operator dual to an M5 brane wrapped\non a five-submanifold \u03a35 \u2282 Y in the (partially) resolved supergravity background, we\ncompute the Euclidean action of an M5 brane which wraps a minimal six-dimensional\nmanifold in X which at large r asymptotes to the cone over \u03a35 . In this section we\npresent an explicit example, although later we will present a general formula for such\nVEVs.\nAgain, we focus on the partially resolved background for Q111 described by (4.10).\nWe are interested in computing the VEV of the operator that was carrying charge\nunder the baryonic symmetry before it was broken. As described in \u00a72, this symmetry\n\noriginates on the supergravity side to a mode (2.10) of the six-form potential C6 along\na five-cycle in the Sasaki-Einstein manifold Q111 . Consider a Euclidean M5 brane\nthat is wrapped on the six-manifold at a fixed point in the (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ) copy of CP1 , and\nis coordinatized by {r, \u03c8, \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03c61 , \u03c62 } in the partial resolution of C(Q111 ). This sixmanifold is a divisor in the partially resolved background, and hence this wrapped M5\nbrane worldvolume is a calibrated submanifold. The M5 brane carries charge under\nthe U(1) gauge field in AdS4 that descends from the corresponding harmonic five-form\nin Q111 . We calculate the Euclidean action of this wrapped M5 brane up to a radial\ncut-off r = rc , identifying e\u2212S(rc ) with the classical field dual to the baryonic operator,\nas in [29].

We will therefore keep our discussion brief and refer the reader to\n[29] for further details. Since the AdS4 radial coordinate is related to r as z = r \u22122 , we\nsee that the operator dimension is \u2206 = N3 , as anticipated by our field theory discussion.\nIndeed, this provides a non-trivial check of the R-charge assignment required for the\ntheory to have an IR superconformal fixed point, supporting the conjecture that the\ntheory is indeed dual to M2 branes moving in C(Q111 ).\n\nFor the remaining M5 branes, wrapped on Euclidean six-submanifolds at a point in\neither the (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) or (\u03b82 , \u03c62) copies of CP1 , we note that e\u2212S(rc ) = 0. This is simply\n\nbecause the M5 brane worldvolumes intersect the M2 brane stack on the exceptional\nCP1 parametrized by (\u03b83 , \u03c63 ) in these cases, and hence the worldvolume action (4.20)\nis logarithmically divergent near to the M2 branes \u2013 for further discussion of this in\nthe D3 brane case, see [21]. Thus the dual gravity analysis of the partially resolved\nsupergravity solution is in perfect agreement with the proposed Q111 field theory, at\nleast with the boundary conditions we study in this section.\n34\n\n\f4.4\n\nWrapped branes and the phase of the condensate\n\nIn the resolved, or partially resolved, geometry one can consider various different kinds\nof stable wrapped branes in the r \u223c 0 region. These shed further light on the physical\ninterpretation of the supergravity solutions.\nIn the fully resolved case with a > 0 and b > 0 one could consider an M5 brane\nwrapping the exceptional CP1 \u00d7 CP1 at r = 0 and filling the spacetime directions x0 ,\nx1 . This is a domain wall in the Minkowski three-space in (4.8). Its tension, given by\nthe energy of the probe brane, is\nEM5 = Twall =\n\nabT5 \u03c0 2\n.\n16\n\n(4.27)\n\nNotice that the warp factor cancels out in this computation, and the brane remains of\nfinite tension even if the stack of M2 branes is placed at r = 0.\nOf more interest for us is to consider an M2 brane wrapping an exceptional CP1 ,\neither in the resolved or partially resolved background. In the former case notice there\nare homologically two choices of such CP1 inside CP1 \u00d7 CP1 at r = 0. Again, in\neither case this is a calibrated cycle. This leads to a point particle in the Minkowski\nthree-space, moving along the time direction x0 , whose mass is\nEM2 = mpoint =\n\nbT2 \u03c0\n.\n4\n\n(4.28)\n\nAgain, its energy remains finite even when the M2 brane stack is at r = 0. This\nwrapped M2 brane is the analogue of the global string that was discussed in [30] for\nthe conifold theory in Type IIB. In our case the worldline of this point particle is linked\nby a circle, as it lives in a three dimensional spacetime. As we shall explain below,\nthere are certain light fields/particles that have monodromies around this circle.\nConsider three-form fluctuations of the form\n\u03b4C3 = A \u2227 \u03b2 ,\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is a two-form on the Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler manifold X, and \u22c68 denotes the Hodge\ndual on X. Demanding that A is a massless gauge field in the Minkowski three-space\nleads to the equations\nd\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\nd( h \u22c68 \u03b2) = 0 .\n\n(4.30)\n\nIn particular \u03b2 is closed and hence defines a cohomology class in H 2 (X, R); we shall\nbe interested in the case where this class is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the two-cycle wrapped by\n35\n\n\fthe particle-like M2 brane. In three dimensions the gauge field A is dual to a periodic\nscalar, which can be identified as the Goldstone boson of the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. Indeed, the M2 particle is a magnetic source for this pseudoscalar. The\npseudoscalar modes will therefore have unit monodromy around a circle linking the\nM2 particle worldline. As in [30], this Goldstone boson is expected to appear as a\nphase, through the Wess-Zumino action of the Euclidean M5 brane, in the baryonic\ncondensate. We shall see that this is indeed the case.\nIt thus remains to construct appropriate two-forms \u03b2 satisfying (4.30) in the warped\nresolved backgrounds for Q111 . This will occupy us for the remainder of this subsection.\nIt will turn out to be simpler to use the metric in form given in (B.13), which we\nreproduce here for convenience:\nds\n\n2\n\n= U\n\n\u22121\n\n3\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i + (l22 + \u033a) d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622\nd\u033a + U\u033a d\u03c8 +\n\n+(l32\nwhere\n\n2\n\ni=1\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n2\n2\n+ \u033a) d\u03b83 + sin \u03b83 d\u03c623 + \u033a d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ,\n\n3 \u033a3 + 4 \u033a2 (l22 + l32 ) + 6 l22 l32 \u033a\nU(\u033a) =\n.\n6 (l22 + \u033a) (l32 + \u033a)\n\n(4.31)\n\n(4.32)\n\nThe constants l2 , l3 are related to the constants a, b in (4.5) via a = 4l22 , b = 4l32 .\n4.4.1\n\nHarmonic forms: unwarped case\n\nAs a warm-up, we begin with the unwarped case in which the warp factor h \u2261 1. It is\nconvenient to introduce the following vielbein\ne\u03b8i = d\u03b8i ,\n\ne\u03c6i = sin \u03b8i d\u03c6i ,\n\ng5 = d\u03c8 +\n\n3\nX\n\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i .\n\n(4.33)\n\ni=1\n\nA natural ansatz for two two-forms \u03b2i , i = 2, 3, is then\n\u03b2i = e\u03b8i \u2227 e\u03c6i + d(fi g5 ) ,\n\ni = 2, 3 ,\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhere fi is a function of the radial coordinate \u033a. Without loss of generality we will\nfocus on the case i = 2 and, in order not to clutter notation, drop the subscript in fi .\nAfter some algebra one finds the following equation for f\n(\u033a + l22 ) (\u033a + l32 )\n(\u033a + l22 ) \u033a\n\u033a (\u033a + l32 )\n(1\n\u2212\nf\n)\n\u2212\nf\n\u2212\nf\n(\u033a + l22 )\n\u033a\n(\u033a + l32 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+\u2202\u033a \u033a (\u033a + l22 ) (\u033a + l32 ) \u2202\u033a f = 0 .\n36\n\n(4.35)\n\n\fSince the corresponding \u03b4C3 fluctuation in (4.29) couples to the M2 brane wrapped\nover the CP1 at \u033a = 0, \u03b2 should approach here the volume form of the finite sized CP1 .\nFor this we require the boundary condition that f (\u033a = 0) vanishes. On the other hand,\nas we will see later, in the large \u033a region \u03b2 should asymptote to a harmonic two-form\n\u03c92 on the singular cone.\nIt turns out that equation (4.35) can be solved exactly. Using the above boundary\nconditions to fix integration constants, we have\n\u033a2 + 23 l32 \u03c1\nf=\n.\n3 (\u033a + l22 ) (\u033a + l32 )\n\n(4.36)\n\nGiven this f , at small \u033a one can check that \u03b2 asymptotes to e\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62 , which is the\nvolume form of the submanifold that the M2 brane is wrapped on, while at large \u033a\ninstead \u03b2 asymptotes to a harmonic two-form \u03c92 on the singular cone which is simply\nthe pull-back of a harmonic two-form on Q111 .\n4.4.2\n\nHarmonic forms: warped case\n\nLet us now turn to the warped case. Since with the M2 brane stack at \u033a = 0 the warp\nfactor is then a function of (\u033a, \u03b82 , \u03b83 ), it is natural to consider the following ansatz for\nthe two-form \u03b2:\n!\n3\nX\nfi e\u03c6i\n,\n(4.37)\n\u03b2 = e\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62 + d f0 g5 +\ni=2\n\nwhere now f\u03bc = f\u03bc (\u033a, \u03b82 , \u03b83 ), and \u03bc = 0, 2 or 3.\n\nThe second equation in (4.30) implies that the f\u03bc must satisfy\n\u0010 h \u221adet g U(\u03c1)\n\n\u0010 h \u221adet g sin \u03b8\n\u0011\n1\ni\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1 fj +\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 fj \u2212\n(4.38)\nl2j + \u03c1\nsin \u03b8i i (l2j + \u033a)(l2i + \u033a) i\ni=2\n\u0010 h \u221adet g cot \u03b8 \u0011\n\u0010 h \u221adet g \u0011\n\u0010 h \u221adet g f \u0011\n0\nj\n+ \u2202j\nfj + \u2202\u03b8j\n\u03b4j,2 = 0 ,\n\u2212\u2202\u03b8j\n(l2j + \u033a)2\n(l2j + \u033a)2\n(l2j + \u033a)2\n3\nX\n\n\u0011\n\nfor \u03bc = j, and\n\u0010 U \u22121 (\u033a) \u221adet g h\n\u0011\n1\n\u2202\u03b8i\nsin\n\u03b8\n\u2202\nf\n(4.39)\ni \u03b8i 0\n2\nsin\n\u03b8\n(\u033a\n+\nl\n)\ni\ni\ni=1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3\n3 \u221a\n\u0010\n\u0011 X\nX\ndet g h\ndet g h\nh det g\n+\n\u2202\u03b8i sin \u03b8i fi \u2212\nf +\n=0,\n2 2\n2 2 0\n2 2\n(\u033a\n+\nl\n)\nsin\n\u03b8\n(\u033a\n+\nl\n)\n(\u033a\n+\nl\n)\ni\n2\ni\ni\ni=2\ni=1\n3\n\u0010 p\n\u0011 X\n\u2202\u033a h det g \u2202\u033a f0 +\n\nfor \u03bc = 0.

Furthermore, if we consider the unwarped case where h \u2261 1\n\nwe can consistently set fi = 0 and assume f0 = f0 (\u033a).

We shall give a\nmore general argument for existence of this two-form later in this section.\nGoing back to the original physical motivation, the warped harmonic form \u03b2 allows\none to construct a three-form fluctuation \u03b4C = A \u2227 \u03b2 that satisfies the linearized\n\nSUGRA equations. Consider the Hodge dual\n\n\u03b4G7 = \u22c63 dA \u2227 h \u22c68 \u03b2 .\n\n(4.41)\n\nAs noted above, the three-dimensional gauge field A is dual to a periodic scalar via\n\u22c63 dA = dp. Thus we can write\n\u03b4G7 = dp \u2227 h \u22c68 \u03b2 = d (p h \u22c68 \u03b2) ,\n\n(4.42)\n\nthus obtaining a local form for the six-form fluctuation. At very large \u033a, \u03b2 can be\napproximated to leading order by\n\u03b2\u223c\n\n1\n1\n2\ne\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62 \u2212 e\u03b81 \u2227 e\u03c61 \u2212 e\u03b83 \u2227 e\u03c63 ,\n3\n3\n3\n\n(4.43)\n\nso that\n\nd\u033a\n\u2227 d\u03c8 \u2227 e\u03b81 \u2227 e\u03c61 \u2227 e\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62 .\n(4.44)\n\u033a2\nThis form of the local potential couples to the baryonic M5 brane through the WessZumino term, thus reinforcing the identification of the scalar p as the phase of the\n\u03b4C6 \u2283 p\n\nbaryonic condensate and Goldstone boson. Furthermore, at large \u033a we can also write\n\u03b4G7 \u2283 d( \u033a\u22121 dp \u2227 d\u03c8 \u2227 e\u03b81 \u2227 e\u03c61 \u2227 e\u03b82 \u2227 e\u03c62 ) .\n38\n\n(4.45)\n\n\fThen, following [30], we note the appearance of the volume form of the submanifold\nwrapped by the baryonic M5 brane, with the appropriate decay for a conserved current\nin three dimensions of dimension 2. This motivates the identification\nhJ\u03bcB i \u223c \u2202\u03bc p .\n\n4.5\n\n(4.46)\n\nGeneral warped resolved Calabi-Yau backgrounds\n\nMuch of our discussion of the resolved Q111 backgrounds can be extended to general\nwarped resolutions of Calabi-Yau cones. In the remainder of this section we describe\nwhat is known about such generalizations. In particular in the next subsection we\npresent a novel method for computing M5 brane condensates in such backgrounds, or\nmore generally the worldvolume actions of branes in warped Calabi-Yau geometries.\n4.5.1\n\nGravity backgrounds\n\nAs for the Q111 case we are interested in M-theory backgrounds of the form\nds211 = h\u22122/3 ds2 (R1,2 ) + h1/3 ds2 (X) ,\n\n(4.47)\n\nG = d3 x \u2227 dh\u22121 ,\nwhere X is a Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler eight-manifold that is asymptotic to a cone metric over\nsome Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifold Y . Placing N spacetime-filling M2 branes at a\npoint y \u2208 X leads to the warp factor equation\n(2\u03c0lp )6 N 8\n\u2206x h[y] = \u221a\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 y) .\ndet gX\n\n(4.48)\n\nHere \u2206h = d\u2217 dh = \u2212\u2207i \u2207i h is the scalar Laplacian of X acting on h. Thus h[y](x)\nis simply the Green's function on X. More generally, one could pick different points\nP\nyi \u2208 X, with Ni M2 branes at yi , such that i Ni = N. Then h[{yi , Ni }](x) will\nbe a sum of Green's functions, weighted by Ni . We shall regard this as an obvious\ngeneralization. There are thus two steps involved in constructing such a solution:\nchoose a Calabi-Yau metric on X, and then solve for the Green's function. If the\nlatter is chosen so that it vanishes at infinity then the SUGRA solution (4.47) will be\nasymptotically AdS4 \u00d7 Y with N units of G7 flux through Y .\n\nIf Y is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold then C(Y ) defines an isolated singularity at the\ntip of the cone r = 0. We may then take a resolution \u03c0 : X \u2192 C(Y ), which defines our\n39\n\n\fmanifold X as a complex manifold. The map \u03c0 is a biholomorphism of complex manifolds on the complement of the singular point {r = 0}, so that in X the singular point\n\nis effectively replaced by a higher-dimensional locus, which is called the exceptional set.\nWe require that the holomorphic (4, 0)-form on C(Y ) extends to a smooth holomorphic\n\n(4, 0)-form on X. Such resolutions are said to be \"crepant\", and they are not always\nguaranteed to exist, even for toric singularities. In the latter case one can typically only\npartially resolve so that X has at worst orbifold singularities. Having chosen such an\nX we must then find a Calabi-Yau metric on X that approaches the given cone metric\nasymptotically. Fortunately, mathematicians have very recently proved that you can\nalways find such a metric. Essentially, this is a non-compact version of Yau's theorem\nwith a \"Dirichlet\" boundary condition, where we have a fixed Sasaki-Einstein metric\nat infinity on \u2202X = Y and ask to fill it in with a Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric. There are a\nnumber of papers that have developed this subject in recent years [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57],\nbut the most recent [58, 59] prove the strongest possible result: that in each K\u00e4hler\nclass in H 2 (X, R) \u223c\n= H 1,1 (X, R) (see [57]) there is a unique Calabi-Yau metric that\nis asymptotic to a fixed given Sasaki-Einstein metric on Y = \u2202X. Note this result\nassumes the existence of the Sasaki-Einstein metric \u2013 it does not prove it.\nThe crepant (partial) resolutions of toric singularities are well understood, being\ndescribed by toric geometry and hence fans of polyhedral cones. The extended K\u00e4hler\ncone for such resolutions is known as the GKZ fan, or secondary fan. The fan is a\ncollection of polyhedral cones living in Rb2 (X) , glued together along their boundaries,\nsuch that each cone corresponds to a particular choice of topology for X. Implicit\nhere is the fact that b2 (X) is independent of which topology for X we choose. A point\ninside the polyhedral cone corresponding to a given X is a K\u00e4hler class on X. The\nboundaries between cones correspond to partial resolutions, where there are further\nresidual singularities, and there is a topology change as one crosses a boundary from\none cone into another. The GKZ fan for Y = Q111 was described in Figure 3. If we\ncombine this description with the above existence results, we see that the GKZ fan is\nin fact classifying the space of resolved asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics.\nHaving chosen a particular resolution and K\u00e4hler class, hence metric, we must then\nfind the warp factor h satisfying (4.48). This amounts to finding the Green's function\non X, and this always exists and is unique using very general results in Riemannian\ngeometry. A general discussion in the Type IIB context may be found in [20], and the\ncomments here apply equally to the M-theory setting. In the warped metric (4.47) the\npoint y \u2208 X is effectively sent to infinity, and the geometry has two asymptotically\n40\n\n\fAdS4 regions: one near r = \u221e that is asymptotically AdS4 \u00d7 Y , and one near to\nthe point y, which if y is a smooth point is asymptotically AdS4 \u00d7 S 7 . For further\n\ndiscussion, see [20, 21, 48].\n\nIf one places the N M2 branes at the same position y \u2208 X, the moduli space\nis naturally a copy of X. The b2 (X) K\u00e4hler moduli are naturally complexified by\nnoting that H 6 (X, Y, R) \u223c\n= H2 (X, R) \u223c\n= Rb2 (X) by Poincar\u00e9 duality, and that this group\nclassifies the periods of C6 through six-cycles in X, which may either be closed or have\na boundary five-cycle on Y = \u2202X. More precisely, taking into account large gauge\ntransformations leads to the torus H 2 (X, Y, R)/H 2(X, Y, Z) \u223c\n= U(1)b2 (X) . Altogether\nthis moduli space of SUGRA solutions should be matched to the full moduli space of\nthe dual SCFT. At least for toric X one can prove quite generally via an exact sequence\nthat b2 (X) = b2 (Y ) + b6 (X), where b6 (X) is also the number of irreducible exceptional\ndivisors in the resolution. In toric language, this is the number of internal lattice points\nin the toric diagram. We shall discuss such examples in \u00a75: the presence of calibrated\nsix-cycles is expected to lead to M5 brane instanton corrections in these backgrounds.\n4.5.2\n\nHarmonic two-forms\n\nRecall we are also interested in fluctuations of the form\n\u03b4C3 = A \u2227 \u03b2 ,\n\n(4.49)\n\nwhere A leads to a massless gauge field in the Minkowski three-space if\nd\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\nd( h \u22c68 \u03b2) = 0 .\n\n(4.50)\n\nFor trivial warp factor h \u2261 1 this just says that \u03b2 is harmonic. It is a general result\nthat if we also impose that \u03b2 is L2 normalizable, or equivalently that A has finite\nkinetic energy in three dimensions, then such forms are guaranteed to exist and are in\n1-1 correspondence with H 2 (X, Y, R) \u223c\n= H6 (X, R) [60]. Thus there are always b6 (X)\nL2 normalizable harmonic two-forms \u03b2 in the unwarped case.\n\nHowever, this case isn't the physical case for applications to AdS/CF T . Instead\nwe should look for solutions to (4.50) where h is the Green's function on X. Again,\nfortunately there are mathematical results that we may appeal to to guarantee existence\nof such forms. These are again described in the Type IIB context in [21]. In the\nwarped case \u03b2 is harmonic with respect to the metric h1/2 ds2 (X). This manifold has\nan asymptotically conical end with boundary S 7 (or more generally YIR if the M2\n41\n\n\fbrane stack is placed at a singular point with horizon YIR ), and an isolated conical\nsingularity with horizon metric 14 ds2 (Y ). The number of L2 harmonic two-forms on\nsuch a space is in fact known, and is b2 (X). To see this requires combining a number\nof mathematical results that are described in [21]. In particular, since b2 (X) = b2 (Y ) +\nb6 (X) there is a corresponding harmonic form, and hence Goldstone mode, for each\nof the b2 (Y ) baryonic U(1) symmetries. Indeed, these b2 (Y ) harmonic forms can be\nseen to asymptote to the harmonic two-forms on Y at r = \u221e. Thus the analysis at\nthe end of \u00a74.4 carries over in much more general backgrounds. We shall analyse the\nasymptotics of the b6 (X) unwarped L2 harmonic forms in more detail in \u00a75, where they\n\nwill be given a very different interpretation.\n\n4.6\n\nBaryonic condensates: M5 branes in general warped geometries\n\nAs discussed in \u00a72.3, M5 branes wrapped on five-manifolds \u03a35 \u2282 Y lead, with appropriate choice of quantization of the gauge fields in AdS4 , to scalar operators in the dual\nSCFT that are charged under the U(1)b2 (Y ) baryonic symmetry group. We have already\ndescribed how to compute the VEV of such an operator in the (partially) resolved Q111\nbackground. More generally one should compute the action of a Euclidean M5 brane\nwhich is wrapped on a minimal six-submanifold D \u2282 X with boundary \u2202D = \u03a35 .\nSimilar computations, in some specific examples, have been performed in [50]. In this\nsection we explain how this Euclidean action may be computed exactly, in general, in\nthe case where D is a divisor. This is essentially a technical computation that may be\nskipped if the reader is not interested in the details: the final formula is (4.79).\nLet suppose that we are given a warped background (4.47), where X has an asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metric and the warp factor satisfying (4.48) is given, with\na specific choice of point y \u2208 X where the stack of N M2 branes are located. We would\nlike to compute\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ p\n6\nexp \u2212T5\ndet gD h[y] d x .\n\n(4.51)\n\nD\n\nHere T5 = 2\u03c0/(2\u03c0lp )6 is the M5 brane tension, and the integrand is the worldvolume\naction (in the absence of a self-dual two-form). Thus gD denotes the pull-back of the\nunwarped metric to the worldvolume D. We also assume that D is a divisor, in order\nto preserve supersymmetry. Then D is also minimal and the integral is\nZ\nZ p\n\u03c93\n6\ndet gD h[y] d x =\nh[y] ,\n(4.52)\nD 3!\nD\n42\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 denotes the K\u00e4hler form of the unwarped metric, pulled back to D.\nBefore beginning our computation, we note that on a K\u00e4hler manifold the scalar\nLaplacian \u2206h = d\u2217 dh can be written as\n \u0304 .\n\u2206h = \u2212\u03c9yddc h = \u22122i\u03c9y\u2202 \u2202h\n\n(4.53)\n\nHere dc \u2261 I \u25e6 d = i(\u2202 \u0304 \u2212 \u2202), where I is the complex structure tensor. The contraction\n\u03c9yddc h is then in local complex coordinates\n\u03c9yddc h = 4\u03c9 ij\u0304\n\n\u22022h\n= \u2212\u2206h ,\n\u2202z i \u2202 z\u0304 j\u0304\n\n(4.54)\n\nwhere\ni\n\u03c9 = \u03c9ij\u0304 dz i \u2227 dz\u0304 j\u0304 .\n2\n\n(4.55)\n\nFor simplicity we shall study the case in which D is described globally by the equation\nD = {f = 0}, where f is a global holomorphic function on X. This means that the\nhomology class of D is trivial, and hence in fact the wrapped M5 brane carries zero\ncharge under U(1)b2 (Y ) . The cases studied in [50] are of this form. More generally, since\nD is a complex divisor it defines an associated holomorphic line bundle LD over X.\nThen we may take D to be the zero set of a holomorphic section of LD , with a simple\nzero along D. To extend the computation below to this case would require combining\nthe argument we give here with the arguments in \u00a75.\n\nThus, suppose that f is a holomorphic function with a simple zero along D, and\n\nintroduce the two-form\n\u03b7D \u2261\n\n1  \u0304\n1 c\ndd log |f | = \u2212\n\u2202 \u2202 log |f |2 .\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0i\n\n(4.56)\n\nLet us examine its properties. First, note that\nlog |f |2 = log f + log f \u0304 .\n\n(4.57)\n\n \u0304 = 0 by definition, this shows that away from the\nSince f is holomorphic, and thus \u2202f\nlocus f = 0, which is the divisor D, in fact \u03b7D = 0. On the other hand, locally along D\nwe can write f = zg where z is a local coordinate normal to D, and g = g(z, w1 , w2, w3 ),\nwhere w1 , w2 , w3 are local complex coordinates along D and g has no zero in this local\nchart. We may then write z = rei\u03b8 , and note that\n1 c\ni\ndd log r = \u03b4 2 (0) dz \u2227 dz\u0304 .\n2\u03c0\n2\n43\n\n(4.58)\n\n\fThis is just the elementary statement that (1/2\u03c0) log r is the unit Green's function in\ndimension two (the local transverse space to D). Thus we have shown that \u03b7D is zero\naway from D, and is a unit delta function supported along D.\nUsing these properties of \u03b7D we may hence write\nZ\nZ\nT5 h[y] \u03c9 3\n\u03c93\nh[y] =\n\u2227 ddc log |f | .\nV \u2261 T5\n2\u03c0 3!\nX\nD 3!\n\n(4.59)\n\nNote in particular that T5 h[y]/2\u03c0 is N times the unit Green's function (with unit delta\nfunction source), i.e.\n\u2206x\n\n\u0012\n\nT5 h[y]\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n=\u221a\n\nN\n\u03b4 8 (x \u2212 y) .\ndet gX\n\n(4.60)\n\nWe then integrate by parts\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n\u03c93\nT5 h[y]\nT5 h[y] \u03c9 3\nc\n\u2227\n\u2227 d log |f | \u2212\nd\n\u2227 dc log |f | .\nV =\n2\u03c0\n3!\n2\u03c0\n3!\nX\n\u2202X=Y\n\n(4.61)\n\nWe will deal with the boundary terms later, focusing for now on the integrals over X.\nFirst note that\n\u03c93\n\u03b3\u2227\n= \u2212 \u22c6 I(\u03b3) .\n3!\n\n(4.62)\n\nholds for any one-form \u03b3.

For now let us deal with the integral over X in (4.64). Using (4.53)\nwe may write\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT5 h[y]\n\u03c93\nN\nT5 h[y] \u03c9 4\n\u03c94\nc\n\u2212 dd\n\u2227\n=\u2206\n=\u221a\n,\n(4.66)\n\u03b4 8 (x \u2212 y)\n2\u03c0\n3!\n2\u03c0\n4!\n4!\ndet gX\n44\n\n\fand thus\nV =\u2212\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nN\u03b4 8 (x \u2212 y) log |f | d8x = \u2212N log |f (y)| + boundary terms .\n\n(4.67)\n\nLet us turn now to the boundary terms. In order to render this finite, we cut off the\nintegral at some large r = rc , and write the boundary integral as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ \u0014\nT5 h[y] c\n\u03c93\nT5 h[y]\nc\nboundary terms =\n\u2227\nd log |f | \u2212 log |f |d\n.\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n3!\nYrc\n\n(4.68)\n\nWe require that D is asymptotically conical, so that at large rc it approaches a cone\nover a compact five-manifold \u03a35 \u2282 Y . In the cone geometry, a conical divisor with\ntrivial homology class is specified as the zero set of a homogeneous function under r\u2202r .\nThus we take\n|f | = Ar \u03bb (1 + . . .) ,\n\n(4.69)\n\nwhere A is homogeneous degree zero (i.e. a function on Y ) and the . . . are terms that\ngo to zero as r \u2192 \u221e. Thus f has asymptotic homogeneous degree \u03bb > 0. Now, the\n\nvolume form on Y is\n\ndvol(Y ) = \u03b7 \u2227\n\n(d\u03b7)3\n,\n23 * 3!\n\n(4.70)\n\nwhere \u03b7 = dc log r and \u03c9cone = 21 d(r 2 \u03b7) is the K\u00e4hler form on the cone over Y . Asymptotically,\n\u03c9 = \u03c9cone + O(r 4) .\n\n(4.71)\n\nThe O(r 4) follows since the leading correction to the cone metric is a harmonic twoform on Y , which is down by a factor of r \u22122 relative to the cone metric. We also\nhave\nN\nT5 h[y]\n=\n(1 + . . .) .\n2\u03c0\n6vol(Y )r 6\nCf. (2.6). Thus the first term in (4.68) is convergent and gives\nZ\nT5 h[y] c\n\u03c93\nN\nN\u03bb\nlim\nd log |f | \u2227\n=\n* \u03bb * vol(Y ) =\n.\nrc \u2192\u221e Y\n2\u03c0\n3!\n6vol(Y )\n6\nrc\n\n(4.72)\n\n(4.73)\n\nNote here that the function A does not contribute to the integral as it is independent\nof r, and thus J(r\u2202r )ydc log A = 0. On the other hand, the second term in (4.68)\n45\n\n\fis divergent, the leading divergent piece being N\u03bb log rc . Provided the . . . terms in\n|f | and h fall off as o(r \u2212\u01eb ), for some \u01eb > 0, then in fact this is the only divergence\n\n(since any positive power of r grows faster than log r). There is also a finite part,\nR\nnamely N Y log A/vol(Y ). However, the important point is that this depends only on\nasymptotic data.\n\nLet us interpret this divergence. Suppose that the Sasaki-Einstein manifold Y is\nquasi-regular, meaning that it is a U(1) bundle over a K\u00e4hler-Einstein orbifold Z.9\nThen asymptotically f is, in its dependence on Z, a holomorphic section of Lk for\n\u22121/I\n\nsome integer k \u2208 Z>0 , where L = KZ\nwith I = I(Z) \u2208 Z>0 being the orbifold Fano\nindex of Z. Here KZ denotes the orbifold canonical bundle of Z, and I is by definition\nthe largest integer so that the root L is defined. It follows that\n\u03bb=\n\n4k\n,\nI\n\n(4.74)\n\nwhere 4 = dimC X. The five-manifold \u03a35 \u2282 Y is then the total space of a U(1) bundle\nover an orbifold surface S \u2282 Z, with the Poincar\u00e9 dual to S being represented by\nc1 (Lk ) = kc1 (Z)/I. The K\u00e4hler-Einstein condition on Z gives\n8[\u03c9Z ] = 2\u03c0c1 (Z) \u2208 H 1,1 (Z, R) ,\n\n(4.75)\n\nwhere \u03c9Z = (1/2)d\u03b7 denotes the K\u00e4hler form of Z.\nNow, the conformal dimension of the operator dual to an M5 brane wrapped on \u03a35\nis given by the general formula\n\u2206(O[\u03a35 ]) =\n\n\u03c0Nvol(\u03a35 )\n.\n6vol(Y )\n\n(4.76)\n\nIn the quasi-regular case at hand, the length of the U(1) circle cancels in the numerator\nand denominator and we can write this as\nR \u03c92\nR \u03c92\n\u03c0N S 2!Z\n\u03c0N kI Z 2!Z \u2227 c1 (V )\n2Nk\n\u2206(O[\u03a35 ]) =\n=\n.\nR \u03c93 =\nR \u03c93\nI\n6 Z 3!Z\n2 Z 2!Z\n\n(4.77)\n\nHere in the last step we used the K\u00e4hler-Einstein condition (4.75). Thus we have the\ngeneral result that the divergent part of the integral is\nN\u03bb log rc = 2\u2206(O[\u03a35 ]) log rc = \u2212\u2206(O[\u03a35 ]) log z ,\n\n(4.78)\n\nwhere we have changed to the usual AdS4 coordinate rc2 = 1/z. Thus we see that the\ndivergent part of the integral is precisely such that we can interpret its coefficient as\n9\n\nIn fact the irregular case can be approximated arbitrarily closely by the quasi-regular case.\n\n46\n\n\fthe VEV of the operator O[\u03a35 ] in this background. This coefficient is, from the above\ncomputations,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nN\u03bb\nN\nN\n\u03bb\nexp(\u2212Vreg ) = |f (y)| exp \u2212\nlog(|f |/r ) .\n(4.79)\n\u2212\n6\nvol(Y ) Y\nThis is an exact result for the VEV, or regularized exponential of the M5 brane action,\nin terms of the defining function f of the divisor D. The integral is understood in the\nlimit Y = Yrc as r = rc \u2192 \u221e, which is convergent as the integrand is independent of r\nin this limit. Notice, in particular, that if one multiplies f by a constant, this constant\ndrops out of the formula, as it should.\n\n5\n\nSix-cycles and non-perturbative superpotentials\n\nSo far our discussion has mainly focused on the Q111 theory and its warped resolved\nsupergravity solutions. However, this solution is somewhat special in that the resolved\nCalabi-Yau manifolds are \"small resolutions\" \u2013 that is, there are no exceptional divisors, or six-cycles, in the resolved solution. An isolated toric Calabi-Yau four-fold\nsingularity will typically have exceptional divisors when it is resolved.10 The irreducible\ncomponents of these divisors are in 1-1 correspondence with the internal lattice points\nin the toric diagram, and a simple homology calculation shows that these generate\nthe group H6 (X, R) of six-cycles. This immediately raises the question of what is the\nAdS/CF T interpretation of such six-cycles, as we mentioned briefly at the end of section 4.5. Again, in order to make our discussion concrete we will begin by focusing on\na simple example, namely the cone over Q222 . This is a Z2 orbifold of Q111 in which\nthe free Z2 quotient is along the R-symmetry U(1) fibre. Further details about the\ngeometry of this manifold are contained in appendix C.\n\n5.1\n\nThe C(Q222) theory\n\nA candidate dual field theory to C(Q222 ) was proposed in [27]. In fact there are (at\nleast) two possible toric phases for this theory. The quivers of the two phases are\n10\nAs already mentioned, generically one can at best partially resolve such singularities so that the\nremaining singularities are all of orbifold type.\n\n47\n\n\fwith superpotentials\nj\ni\nm\nn\nWI = Tr \u01ebij \u01ebmn X12\nX23\nX34\nX41\n,\n\u0011\n\u0010\njn\njn\ni\nm\nm\ni\n.\nWII = Tr \u01ebij \u01ebmn X32\nX24\nX43\n\u2212 \u01ebij \u01ebmn X31\nX14\nX43\n\n(5.1)\n\nFollowing the same prescription for C(Q111 ), we will consider quantizations of the\ngauge fields in AdS4 such that the gauge groups are U(1)G \u00d7 U(1)G\u22121 \u00d7 SU(N)4 . As\nshown in [27], the moduli spaces of both phases give the desired cone over Q222 . Furthermore, with SU(N) gauge groups we have two global U(1) baryonic symmetries,\nwhich precisely match the b2 (Q222 ) = 2 gauge fields we find in AdS4 from the gravitational point of view. Thus, as far as the moduli space and baryonic symmetries are\nconcerned, the C(Q222 ) case closely resembles its C(Q111 ) cousin.\n\nHowever, inspection of the C(Q222 ) toric diagram in Figure 4 shows an interior lattice\n\nFigure 4: The toric diagram for C(Q222 ).\npoint, signaling the possibility of blowing up a six-cycle. We shall discuss the geometry\n48\n\n\fof such resolutions in more detail later in this section. However, this immediately raises\nthe question of the field theory interpretation of this six-cycle. As we discuss in the\nnext subsection, such six-cycles have been shown to be responsible for non-perturbative\nsuperpotentials in Calabi-Yau compactifications via wrapped Euclidean M5 branes. We\nare interested in such contributions to a non-perturbative superpotential in warped\nCalabi-Yau backgrounds. The warping here is induced by the back-reaction of pointlike M2 brane sources on the Calabi-Yau.11\nIn previous sections we have argued that, for toric singularities with no vanishing\nsix-cycles, we can choose a set of boundary conditions which amounts to ungauging\nall but the BG\u22121 , BG U(1) symmetries. This gives rise to a field theory moduli space\n\nwhich is roughly a (C\u2217 )b2 (Y ) fibration over the mesonic space. Here the fibres are the\nglobal U(1)s we do not quotient by, and their corresponding D-terms that we do not\nimpose. On the SUGRA side, the mesonic part of the moduli space arises from the N\nM2 branes that are free to move in the geometry. The b2 (Y ) C\u2217 s are instead naturally\nthe b2 (Y ) = b2 (X) K\u00e4hler classes plus the corresponding periodic scalars coming from\nmodes of C3 on associated two-cycles. More generally we have b2 (X) = b2 (Y ) + b6 (X),\nwhere X is a Calabi-Yau resolution of Y . We can at this point consider the same\noperation for geometries with six-cycles, so that b6 (X) 6= 0. However, in this case\nthe field theory moduli space seems to be too small. Let us consider the C(Q222 )\n\nexample. In field theory we still have a (C\u2217 )2 fibration over SymN C(Q222 ) as moduli\nspace, since there are again only 4 nodes in the quiver. On the other hand, the gravity\nside has 3 K\u00e4hler classes and corresponding periodic scalars coming from modes of C3\non the two-cycles (see \u00a75.3). This immediately implies that the classical field theory\nmoduli space cannot possibly match all the gravity solutions. However, as argued in\nthe next subsections, geometries with exceptional six-cycles may have non-perturbative\ncorrections which could potentially fix this mismatch.\n\n5.2\n\nNon-perturbative superpotentials from six-cycles\n\nThe presence of exceptional six-cycles in warped resolved Calabi-Yau backgrounds\nraises the very interesting possibility that Euclidean M5 branes (EM5) may wrap such\ncycles. Indeed, the toric geometries under consideration do not have three-cycles, either in the boundary Sasaki-Einstein manifold Y , or in the Calabi-Yau resolution X of\nC(Y ). Thus there are no cycles on which to wrap Euclidean M2 branes, leaving only\n11\n\nIt might be possible to generalize this to the case with SUSY G-flux, in which the flux also sources\nthe warp factor.\n\n49\n\n\fEM5 branes as possible instantonic branes in these backgrounds. More precisely, such\nEM5 branes may be wrapped on the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor\nin the Calabi-Yau resolution. Such cycles, being complex submanifolds, are automatically supersymmetric. Moreover, as already mentioned, the irreducible components\nare in 1-1 correspondence with the generating homology classes in H6 (X, R).\nA very similar situation was considered in [33], where compactifications of M-theory\nto three dimensions on a Calabi-Yau four-fold were discussed. In that reference the r\u00f4le\nof Euclidean instantonic M5 branes, and their possible contribution to non-perturbative\nsuperpotentials, was studied in detail. In order to generate such contributions, the number of zero modes, which includes the Goldstinos of the SUSYs broken by the brane,\nmust be appropriate to saturate the superspace measure. In particular, such instantons\nmust wrap cycles without infinitesimal holomorphic deformations, since the superpartners of the deformation moduli would provide additional fermionic zero modes. In [33]\nit was shown that the appropriate zero mode counting in the case of an M5 brane\nwrapping a divisor D in this set-up requires the necessary condition that\n\u03c7(D, OD ) \u2261\n\n3\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u22121)i dim H i (D, OD ) = 1 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nThis is the arithmetic genus of D. Assuming this necessary condition is satisfied,\nthe structure of the non-perturbative superpotential generated by an EM5 brane also\nrequires one to understand its dependence on the K\u00e4hler moduli. As explained in [33],\nthe dependence on these K\u00e4hler moduli is known exactly, being encoded entirely in the\nsemi-classical term e\u2212V +i\u03c6 . Here V denotes the volume of the six-cycle, while \u03c6 is the\nexpected linear multiplet superpartner to V and is given by the period of C6 through\nD. This latter structure is determined from holomorphy of the superpotential.\nIt is well-known that for any smooth compact toric manifold the arithmetic genus in\n(5.2) is indeed equal to 1. This suggests that EM5 branes would typically generate nonperturbative contributions to the superpotential in such cases. However, at this point\nwe should recall that the situation in [33] is slightly different from the one at hand.\nFirstly, our Calabi-Yau four-fold is non-compact, so that gravity is decoupled from the\npoint of view of reduction to Minkowski three-space. Secondly, our set-up contains\nalso point-like M2 branes, and moreover in the warped solutions the back-reaction of\nthese M2 branes is also included. This leads to the asymptotically AdS4 backgrounds\ndiscussed in section 2.1. It should however be possible to extend the analysis of [33] to\nsuch warped cases.\n50\n\n\fLet us first briefly discuss a similar situation in the more controlled Type IIB scenario. In that case one can consider a Calabi-Yau three-fold singularity with colour\nand fractional D branes wrapping the collapsed cycles at the singularity, leading to a\nfour-dimensional N = 1 SUSY field theory at the singularity. In addition one can con-\n\nsider instantonic Euclidean Ep branes. The various types of strings stretching between\nthese branes can give rise to non-perturbative contributions to the superpotential of\nthe field theory at the Calabi-Yau singularity. Exactly as for the M-theory case, in\norder for this non-perturbative superpotential to be generated at all the right number\nof zero modes must be present. An important remark here is that the Ep-Ep sector\nsees the full N = 2 Calabi-Yau three-fold background, thus generically leading to too\nmany zero modes to saturate the N = 1 superspace measure. Therefore in order for\na non-perturbative superpotential to be generated, some method of eliminating these\nextra zero modes is required. On the other hand, the situation in M-theory is very\n\ndifferent since the colour M2 branes do not break any further the SUSYs of the CalabiYau four-fold background. From this point of view, we then expect EM5 instantons\nto generically contribute to non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential in three\ndimensions.\nNevertheless, the structure and interpretation of such corrections is far from clear.\nWe can think of the gravitational background as a warped Calabi-Yau four-fold compactification, albeit one which is asymptotically an AdS4 background. As such, we\nexpect to be able to promote all moduli, both K\u00e4hler and those related to the positions of the M2 branes in the colour stack, to spacetime fields in the Minkowski\nthree-space. These will be dynamical fields provided the fluctuations are normalizable\nin the warped metric; at least for the K\u00e4hler moduli this is expected to be the case,\nas discussed in the Type IIB context in [21]. However, finding an ansatz for such a\nreduction is far from trivial, and at the time of writing there is no complete proposal\nfor such an ansatz which would allow one to compute the precise form of the nonpertubative superpotential for these modes. The most recent paper on this subject\nis [62], where the authors consider only the universal K\u00e4hler modulus in a warped\ncompactification. On the other hand, following the more controlled Type IIB case,\none might expect that computing the warped volume of the Euclidean brane is the\ndual \"closed membrane channel\" of the picture above, described in terms of M2 branes\nin the blown up Calabi-Yau four-fold in the presence of the EM5 branes. In the IIB\ncase it has been explicitly checked [50] in some simple situations how the computation\nof open string diagrams in the relevant sector [63, 64] can be reproduced though the\n51\n\n\fcomputation of warped volumes, which are then interpreted as a resummation of such\nopen string diagrams. Of course, it should be stressed that in the M-theory scenario\nat hand this can be taken only as a heuristic picture. In any case, one would expect\nthat a general holographic interpretation of the superpotential should also be available,\nsince the warped background is asymptotically AdS4 . One natural suggestion is that\nthis might come from considering the boundary behaviour of the six-form fluctuation\nsourced by the EM5 branes. We leave a more complete investigation of these issues for\nfurther work. Instead in this paper we focus on computing the warped volumes of the\nEM5 branes as a function of the moduli. Understanding precisely how this is related to\nnon-perturbative corrections in these warped resolved geometries will require further\nwork.\n\n5.3\n\nEM5 instantons in the resolved Q222 background\n\nThere is a unique resolution of C(Q222 ) where one blows up the six-cycle corresponding\nto the internal lattice point in Figure 4. This gives a Calabi-Yau four-fold X which is\nthe total space of the canonical bundle O(\u22122, \u22122, \u22122) \u2192 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 . There is\n\na K\u00e4hler class for each factor in the zero section exceptional divisor (CP1 )3 , leading to\na GKZ fan which is (R\u22650 )3 , as shown in Figure 5. By the general theorem mentioned\n\nFigure 5: The GKZ fan for Q222 is (R\u22650 )3 . The axes \u03b6a , a = 1, 2, 3, may be identified\nwith the K\u00e4hler classes of each factor in CP1 \u00d7 CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , or equivalently the FI\nparameters in the GLSM.\n\n52\n\n\fearlier we know that there will be a unique Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric, which is asymptotic\nto the cone metric over Q222 , for each choice of K\u00e4hler class. Again, in this case one\ncan write these metrics explicitly:\nds\n\n2\n\n3\n\u00112 (2a + r 2 ) \u0010\n\u0011\nX\nr2 \u0010\n2\n2\n2\n= \u03ba(r) dr + \u03ba(r)\nd\u03c8 +\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i +\nd\u03b82 + sin \u03b82 d\u03c62\n16\n8\ni=1\n\u0011 r2 \u0010\n\u0011\n(2b + r 2 ) \u0010 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(5.3)\n+\nd\u03b83 + sin \u03b83 d\u03c63 +\nd\u03b81 + sin \u03b81 d\u03c61 ,\n8\n8\n\u22121\n\n2\n\nwhere now\n\n\u03ba(r) =\n\nr 8 + 83 (a + b) r 6 + 8 a b r 4 \u2212 16 k\n.\nr 4 (2 a + r 2 ) (2 b + r 2 )\n\n(5.4)\n\nHere a, b and k are arbitrary constants, and correspond to the choice of K\u00e4hler classes\n\u03b6a , a = 1, 2, 3. In particular, setting a = b = 0 implies that all three CP1 s have the\nsame volume, and the metric simplifies considerably. In this case it is convenient to\ndefine r\u22c68 = 16k, so that the exceptional divisor is at the radial position r = r\u22c6 . For\nfurther details about these metrics we refer the reader to appendix D.\nAgain, it is also possible to solve explicitly for the warp factor for these metrics. In\nthe simplified case with a = b = 0, one can place the stack of N M2 branes at an\narbitrary radial position r = r0 \u2265 r\u22c6 and solve for the Green's function. Again, we\nrefer the reader to appendix D for details of this warp factor. From now on we focus\nexclusively on the case a = b = 0, where \u03b61 = \u03b62 = \u03b63 is parametrized by the radius\nr\u22c6 > 0.\n5.3.1\n\nWarped volumes\n\nWe are interested in computing the warped volume of the compact exceptional divisor\n(CP1 )3 at r = r\u22c6 , with the stack of N M2 branes at the position y = (r0 , \u03be0 ). Here \u03be0\ndenotes the point in the copy of Q222 at radius r = r0 . Thus we define\nZ p\ndet gD h d6 x\n(5.5)\nS = T5\nD\n\nwhere D is the exceptional divisor and h is the (pull back of the) warp factor. Here\nthe latter is given by the expression (D.10) in terms of the mode expansion discussed\nin appendix D. The determinant of the metric pulled back to the divisor is simply\np\n\ndet gD =\n\nr\u22c66\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b83 .\n83\n\n53\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fAfter subtituting these results into the worldvolume action one obtains\nZ\nT5 r\u22c66 X\n\u2217\nS= 3\nYI (\u03be0 ) \u03c8I (r\u22c6 )\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b83 YI (\u03be) d6x .\n8\nD\nI\n\n(5.7)\n\nExplicitly, the integral reads\nZ\n\nD\n\n6\n\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b83 YI (\u03be) d x = CI\n\n3 Z\nY\ni=1\n\n\u03c0\n\u03b8i =0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nsin \u03b8i ei mi \u03c6i J0, li , mi (\u03b8i ) d\u03b8i d\u03c6i .(5.8)\n\n\u03c6i =0\n\nHere CI is a normalization constant that ensures the mode YI has unit norm. The\n\u03c6i integrals vanish unless mi = 0.

The claim is that the precise relation between the two is (for\nN = 1)\n\u03b2=\n\n1  \u0304\n\u2202 \u2202S .\n\u03c0i\n54\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fHere the derivatives are regarded as acting on the coordinates of the point y = (r0 , \u03be0),\nwhich recall is the location of the stack of M2 branes. We shall prove this claim in\nfull generality in \u00a75.4. Here we first prove it in the current explicit example, where\nit is convenient to use the coordinate system in section B.1. From (C.2) we see that\nr08 = r\u22c68 + \u03c14 , so in the new coordinate system we can write (setting N = 1)\n\u00103\n7\nr\u22c68 \u0011\nr\u22c66\n2\n.\n, 1, , 4\nS=\n2 F1\n3 (\u03c14 + r\u22c68 ) 43\n4\n4 \u03c1 + r\u22c68\n\n(5.15)\n\nAfter some algebra it can be shown that\n\n(\u2202 \u0304 \u2212 \u2202)S = i\n\nr\u22c66\ng5 ,\n(\u03c14 + r\u22c68 )3/4\n\n(5.16)\n\nwhere\ng5 = d\u03c8 +\n\n3\nX\n\ncos \u03b8i d\u03c6i ,\n\n(5.17)\n\ni=1\n\nand therefore (5.14) reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1  \u0304\n1\n1\nr\u22c66\n1\n \u0304\nS = d(\u2202 \u2212 \u2202)\nS =\nd\ng5 .\n\u03b2 = \u2202\u2202\n\u03c0i\n2\n\u03c0i\n2\u03c0\n(\u03c14 + r\u22c68 )3/4\nGoing back to the original coordinates we then have\n\u0012 6 \u0013\n1\nr\n\u03b2=\nd \u22c66 g5 .\n2\u03c0\nr0\n\n(5.18)\n\n(5.19)\n\nThis is easily checked to be a harmonic two-form with respect to the unwarped metric,\nand also L2 with respect to this metric. To see that \u03b2 is indeed Poincare dual to the\nsix-cycle, we choose the following closed form on X = O(\u22122, \u22122, \u22122) \u2192 (CP1 )3\n\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b83\nd\u03b81 \u2227 d\u03c61 \u2227 d\u03b82 \u2227 d\u03c62 \u2227 d\u03b83 \u2227 d\u03c63 .\n26 \u03c0 3\nIt is easy to see that\nZ\nZ\n\u03bc=\n\n\u03bc = 1,\n\nD\n\nX\n\n\u03b2 \u2227 \u03bc=1.\n\n(5.20)\n\n(5.21)\n\nHence \u03b2 is L2 normalizable and Poincar\u00e9 dual to the divisor, as claimed.\n5.3.3\n\nCritical points\n\nFormally, the superpotential that is induced by the instanton action that we have\ncalculated in the previous subsections is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u00103\n2 N r\u22c66\n7 \u0010 r\u22c6 \u00118 \u0011\n\u2212S\n,\n(5.22)\nW = e = exp\n, 1, ,\n2 F1\n3 r06\n4\n4 r0\n55\n\n\fwhere S is given in (5.13). This is something of a formal statement, since in reality\nwhat we have computed is the on-shell Euclidean action of the wrapped M5 brane as\na function of the moduli of the SUGRA background. Here essentially r\u22c6 is a K\u00e4hler\nmodulus, while r0 is a modulus associated to the position of the stack of M2 branes. On\nthe other hand, the superpotential should be a function of the corresponding spacetime\nfields in Minkowski space, obtained by promoting these moduli to dynamical fields. In\nthe unwarped case there is essentially no distinction between the two, but in the warped\ncase it is not known how to do this at present, and the situation is much less clear.\nNote also that we have only computed the real part of S, and hence absolute value of\nW . Thus the best we can do is to examine the critical points of e\u2212S interpreted directly\nas a superpotential on the SUGRA moduli space. It is straightforward to compute\n\u2202r0 S =\n\n4 N r\u22c66 r0\n.\nr\u22c68 \u2212 r08\n\n(5.23)\n\nFor r\u22c6 > 0 there are no critical points of S. In order for dW = 0 we must then\nnecessarily have r0 = r\u22c6 , which gives S = +\u221e and W = 0 on this locus. In this\ncase the branes move only on the six-cycle. Clearly, this is always a solution since\nthe \"superpotential\" (5.22) is identically zero if the branes are moving on the divisor\nD. For r\u22c6 = 0 there are formally no contributions of instantons to the superpotential.\nHowever, notice this is a singular limit of the SUGRA solution in which the six-cycle is\nblown down. In the absence of instantons of the course M2 branes are free to propagate\non the cone C(Q222 ) in which the six-cycle is blown down.\n\nIn \u00a7E we have performed the same computation of the warped volume in the much\nsimpler toy example of the Eguchi-Hanson manifold. Interestingly, the same qualitative results on the behaviour of the warped volume (basically the non-perturbative\nsuperpotential) are obtained.\n\n5.4\n\nEM5 brane instantons: general discussion\n\nIn this section we describe how the above calculations for Q222 generalize to more\ngeneral Calabi-Yaus.\n5.4.1\n\nGeometric set-up\n\nThroughout this section we assume we are given an asymptotically conical K\u00e4hler\nmanifold X of complex dimension n, with metric g = gX and K\u00e4hler two-form \u03c9.\nThis means that the manifold X is non-compact, and that the metric g asymptotically\n56\n\n\fapproaches the cone metric dr 2 + r 2gY , where Y = \u2202X is the compact base of the cone.\nThe metric gY is then Sasakian, by definition. In fact this is slightly too general for\nthe situation we are interested in. More precisely, we want X to be a resolution of the\nsingularity at r = 0 of the cone C(Y ) \u223c\n= (R\u22650 \u00d7 Y ) \u222a {r = 0}. This means that there is\na proper birational map \u03c0 : X \u2192 C(Y ) which is a biholomorphism on the restriction\nX \\ E \u2192 {r > 0} \u2282 C(Y ). Less formally, the resolution X replaces the singular point\n\n{r = 0} of the cone by the exceptional set E = \u03c0 \u22121 (r = 0). For physical applications\nwe require the metric g on X to be Ricci-flat and hence Calabi-Yau. Then by definition\nX above is a crepant resolution of the cone singularity. In fact this won't really affect\nthe computations that follow.\n\nOf particular interest for us in this section are the exceptional divisors in X. These\nare the irreducible (prime) divisors of E = \u03c0 \u22121 (r = 0). Call these irreducible components Ei . Since X is contractable onto E we have\nH2n\u22122 (X, R) \u223c\n= H2n\u22122 (E, R) \u223c\n=\n\nM\ni\n\nH2n\u22122 (Ei , R) \u223c\n= Rb2n\u22122 (X) ,\n\n(5.24)\n\nso that i = 1, . . . , b2n\u22122 (X) = dim H2n\u22122 (X, R). Thus the exceptional divisors Ei\ngenerate the homology of X in codimension two. Notice that if b2n\u22122 (X) = 0 then\nthe resolution has no exceptional divisors and the resolution is said to be small. For\nexample, the resolved conifold is a small resolution of the cone over T 1,1 , since the\nexceptional set is E \u223c\n= CP1 ; similarly, the resolutions of Q111 considered in \u00a74 are\nsmall.\n5.4.2\n\nL2 harmonic two-forms\n\nAnother key result for us is that in the above situation\nHL2 2 (X, g) \u223c\n= H2n\u22122 (X, R) ,\n= H 2 (X, Y, R) \u223c\n\n(5.25)\n\nfor n > 2. Here HL2 2 (X, g) denotes the L2 normalizable harmonic two-forms on X\n(which thus depends on the metric g). That is, the codimension two cycles in X are\n1-1 with the prime exceptional divisors, and these are also 1-1 with the L2 normalizable\nharmonic two-forms on X, as long as n > 2. This result about L2 harmonic forms holds\nin general for complete asymptotically conical manifolds, and was proven in [60]. In\ndimension n = 2, instead H2 2 (X) \u223c\n= Im [H 2 (X, Y, R) \u2192 H 2 (X, R)]. For example, for\nL\n\nthe Eguchi-Hanson manifold the map H 2 (X, Y, Z) \u2192 H 2(X, Z) is multiplication by 2,\nso that there is a unique L2 harmonic two-form, up to scale.\n57\n\n\fWe shall need some more information about these harmonic forms. First, we note\nthat the harmonic two-forms are of Hodge type (1, 1). This is because they are Poincar\u00e9\ndual to divisors in X, so if there was a (0, 2) part of the harmonic form it would be\ncohomologically trivial and hence12 identically zero by the result of [60].\nPick a particular D = Ei and normalize the associated L2 harmonic two-form so that\nit is Poincar\u00e9 dual to D. We may then think of the harmonic form as the curvature\nof a Hermitian line bundle L = LD \u2013 the divisor bundle for D. If s is a local nowhere\nzero holomorphic section of L over an open set U \u2282 X, and H is the Hermitian metric\non L, then we may write the harmonic form as\n\u03b2 |U =\n\n1  \u0304\n\u2202 \u2202 log H(s, s) .\n2\u03c0i\n\n(5.26)\n\nThis is a standard result. Notice that \u03b2 here does not depend on the choice of local\nholomorphic section s. We will be interested in the special case where we take U as\nlarge as possible, which is U = X \\ D. By construction, the line bundle LD is trivial\nover U, with trivializing nowhere zero holomorphic section s. We pick an s, and write\nH = H(s, s) for the corresponding real function on X \\ D.\n\nWe next note that log H is itself a harmonic function on X \\ D. To see this, suppose\n\ngenerally we have a harmonic (1, 1)-form \u03b2. Because (X, g) is complete, this means \u03b2\nis both closed and co-closed. The co-closed condition involves computing the Hodge\ndual of \u03b2, which is\n\u22c6 \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b2 \u2227 \u03c9 n\u22122 + (\u03c9y\u03b2)\u03c9 n\u22121 .\n\n(5.27)\n\nHere we have simply used that vol = \u03c9 n /n! and that \u03b2 is type (1, 1). Thus \u03b2 ij \u03c9im \u03c9jn =\n\u03b2mn . By definition, \u03c9y\u03b2 = (1/2!)\u03c9ij \u03b2 ij . Thus if \u03b2 is closed, then \u22c6\u03b2 is co-closed if and\nonly if \u03c9y\u03b2 is closed, i.e. constant.\nThus we learn that for a harmonic (1, 1)-form \u03b2, \u03c9y\u03b2 is in fact constant. Now, for\nan L2 form on an asymptotically conical manifold this constant is in fact necessarily\nzero. To see why, we must look at the asymptotics of \u03b2. This was studied in appendix\nA of [21]. Here we have a two-form, so p = 2 in Table 4 of that reference, and we are\ninterested in L2\u221e , so that the form is normalizable at infinity. For n > 2, p < n so\n\nthe normalizable modes are of type II and type III\u2212 . However, the type II modes are\nconstructed from harmonic one-forms on the base Y , and there are not any of these\n12\n\nNotice this result definitely fails for spaces that are not asymptotically conical. A good example\nis the Taub-NUT space, which has no two-cycles but does have an L2 harmonic two-form.\n\n58\n\n\fas (Y, gY ) is a positive curvature Einstein manifold so b1 (Y ) = 0 by Myers' theorem.\nThus asymptotically, the two-form \u03b2 is to leading order of the form\n\u03b2 \u223c d(r 2\u2212n\u2212\u03bd \u03b2\u03bc ) ,\n\n(5.28)\n\nwhere \u03b2\u03bc is a massive co-closed one-form along Y\n\u2206Y \u03b2\u03bc = \u03bc\u03b2 ,\n\n(5.29)\n\np\n\n(5.30)\n\nand\n\u03bd=\n\n(n \u2212 2)2 + \u03bc .\n\nConsider now \u03c9y\u03b2. Since asymptotically \u03c9 \u223c (1/2)d(r 2\u03b7), where \u03b7 = i(\u2202 \u0304 \u2212 \u2202) log r is\nthe contact one-form of the Sasakian manifold (Y, gY ), we have\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u2212n\u2212\u03bd\n(5.31)\n(2 \u2212 n \u2212 \u03bd)\u03b2\u03bc y\u03b7 + d\u03b2\u03bc yd\u03b7 .\n\u03c9y\u03b2 \u223c r\n2\nSince \u03bd > 0 it follows that \u03c9y\u03b2 \u2192 0 at infinity. Since we have also shown that \u03c9y\u03b2\n\nis constant, it follows that this constant is zero. If we write \u03b2 as in (5.26) on X \\ D,\nthen \u03c9y\u03b2 = 0 is equivalent to saying that log H is harmonic. This just follows from\n \u0304 .\nthe form of the scalar Laplacian on a K\u00e4hler manifold: \u2206f = \u22122\u03c9yi\u2202 \u2202f\n\nAs an aside comment that will be important below, the first non-zero eigenvalue \u03bc is\n\nbounded below by 4(n\u22121). In fact, this is saturated precisely by Killing one-forms \u2013 see,\np\nfor example, [61]. Thus \u03bc \u2265 4(n \u2212 1) and correspondingly \u03bd \u2265 (n \u2212 2)2 + 4(n \u2212 1) =\n\nn.\n\nWe thus conclude that log H is a harmonic function. It will be crucial in what follows\nthat log H is not in fact defined everywhere on X. By construction, it is defined only\non X \\ D. Along D in fact log H is singular. This is simply because D is the zero\nset of s, which has a simple zero along D by assumption. Thus if z = \u03c1 ei\u03b8 is a local\ncomplex coordinate normal to D, with D at \u03c1 = 0, then log H blows up near to D like\nlog \u03c12 = 2 log \u03c1.\n5.4.3\n\nThe instanton action\n\nAn instantonic brane wrapped on an exceptional divisor D = Ei is calibrated and\nsupersymmetric \u2013 for example, a D3 brane for n = 3 in Type IIB string theory or an\nM5 brane for n = 4 in M-theory. These are in 1-1 correspondence with the homology\n59\n\n\fclasses H2n\u22122 (X, R), and moreover there is a unique L2 harmonic two-form associated to\neach irreducible exceptional divisor, which is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the divisor, as discussed\nabove.\nLet G[y](x) denote the Green's function on X, with a fixed (Ricci-flat) K\u00e4hler metric,\nnormalized so that\n1\n\u2206x G[y](x) = 2\u03c0 \u221a\n\u03b4 2n (x \u2212 y) .\n(5.32)\ndet gX\nConsider the on-shell action of an instantonic brane, given by the following Green's\nfunction weighted volume of D:\nZ\nZ\np\n\u03c9 n\u22121\n2n\u22122\n.\n(5.33)\nV =\nG[y] det gD d\nx=\nG[y]\n(n \u2212 1)!\nD\nD\n\nThis is the relevant formula both for D3 branes and M5 branes, where the warp factor\nis h = NG/T , with N the number of spacetime filling branes and T the tension of the\nwrapped instanton brane. The warped volume V depends on the source point y \u2208 X,\n\nso V = V (y). Of course, it also depends on the choice of K\u00e4hler metric. If we consider\nthe Calabi-Yau case, we know that there is a unique metric in each K\u00e4hler class, so we\nmay think of V also as a function of the K\u00e4hler class: V = V (y; [\u03c9]). Then we claim\nthat\n\n1\n(5.34)\nV (y) = \u2212 log H(y) .\n2\nOf course, log H depends implicitly on the K\u00e4hler metric since the associated harmonic\nform does also. Notice this result actually provides a formula for the L2 harmonic twoforms on an asymptotically conical K\u00e4hler manifold, in terms of the Green's function\non X. This is a new mathematical result, as far as we are aware.13\nThe strategy for proving this claim involves three steps: (i) show that V (y) is a\nharmonic function on X \\ D, (ii) show that V diverges as \u2212 log \u03c1 along D, (iii) show\n \u0304 is L2 . These steps show that the latter two-form is an L2\nthat the two-form i\u2202 \u2202V\nharmonic form that is Poincar\u00e9 dual to D. We may then appeal to the uniqueness of\nsuch a form.\nStep (i). This is straightforward. We want to compute \u2206y acting on V . Using that\nthe Green's function G[y](x) is symmetric in its arguments, so G[y](x) = G[x](y), then\nprovided y \u2208\n/D\nZ\np\n(5.35)\n\u2206y V = (\u2206y G[y](x)) det gD d2n\u22122 x = 0 .\nD\n\n13\n\nWe thank Tamas Hausel for discussions on this.\n\n60\n\n\fThe last step follows since y \u2208\n/ D. This shows that V (y), interpreted as a function on\nX \\ D, is indeed harmonic.\nStep (ii). Near to the source point y we have\nG[y](x) =\n\n2\u03c0\n(1 + o(1)) ,\n(2n \u2212 2)vol(S 2n\u22121 )\u03c12n\u22122\n\n(5.36)\n\nwhere \u03c1 denotes geodesic distance from y, where we regard the latter as fixed. Here\nvol(S 2n\u22121 ) is the volume of a unit (2n \u2212 1)-sphere, which appears in this computation\nas a small sphere around the point y. The divergence is a local question, so this is really\na question in Euclidean space. Let us take the local model Cn\u22121 \u00d7 C, with complex\ncoordinate z on C. We suppose that the divisor D is locally z = 0 in this patch, and\nthat the point y is (0, z) in this coordinate system. The integral over D is finite outside\na ball B\u03b4 of fixed radius \u03b4 > 0 in Cn\u22121 \u00d7 {0}, so we would like to analyse the divergence\nin the integral\n\n2\u03c0\n(2n \u2212 2)vol(S 2n\u22121 )\n\nZ\n\nB\u03b4\n\n(R2\n\n1\nR2n\u22123 dR dVol(S 2n\u22123 ) ,\n+ |z|2 )n\u22121\n\nas |z| \u2192 0.

We consider the two-form ddc V (y) as the point y tends to infinity. Since\nwe have already shown this two-form is harmonic, it will have an asymptotic expansion\nas in Appendix A of [21]. There are three types of modes, I, II and III. As already\nmentioned, there are in fact no modes of type II since Y has no harmonic one-forms.\nThe modes of type I are pull-backs of harmonic two-forms on Y , which are not L2 .\n\nThe modes of type III\u00b1 are of the form\n\u0001\nd r 2\u2212n\u00b1\u03bd \u03b2\u03bc ,\n61\n\n(5.41)\n\n\fp\nwith \u03bd = (n \u2212 2)2 + \u03bc2 as above. The III\u2212 modes are L2 , while III+ are not. Thus\nwe must show that ddc V has leading term of type III\u2212 , so that it is normalizable at\ninfinity and hence normalizable.\nSince V is globally defined on X \\ D, we immediately see that there can be no\nmode of type I since near infinity ddc V is exact. Thus we are reduced to analysing the\nasymptotic r-dependence of the one-form dc V .\nIf we regard the point x as fixed, then as y tends to infinity we have\nG[y](x) =\n\n2\u03c0\n(1 + o(1)).\n(2n \u2212 2)vol(Y )r 2n\u22122\n\n(5.42)\n\nThen\n1 c\n\u03b2=\ndd\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9 n\u22121\nG[y]\n,\n(n \u2212 1)!\nD\n\n(5.43)\n\ngives to leading order\n\u03b2\u223c\u2212\nWe thus conclude that\n\n\u0001\nvol(D)\nd r 2\u22122n \u03b7 .\nvol(Y )\n\n2 \u2212 n \u00b1 \u03bd = 2 \u2212 2n .\n\n(5.44)\n\n(5.45)\n\nFrom the comment above, this means that we indeed have a normalizable mode III\u2212 ,\nand moveover that \u03bd = n and hence \u03bc = 4(n \u2212 1) saturates the lower bound on the\neigenvalue. The Killing one-form \u03b7 is of course dual to the R-symmetry.\nThis completes our proof.\nAs a final check on the last asymptotic formula, we can compare with the EguchiHanson result (E.56). These indeed agree, noting that vol(D) = \u03c0c2 and vol(Y ) = \u03c0 2\nin this case.\n5.4.4\n\nThe superpotential\n\nTo conclude our results thus far, we have proven in general that\ne\u2212V (y, [\u03c9]) =\n\np\n\nH(y) ,\n\n(5.46)\n\nwhere (1/2\u03c0i)\u2202 \u2202 \u0304 log H is the unique L2 harmonic two-form that is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the\ndivisor D wrapped by the instanton. The on-shell action of this instanton is V . Notice\n\u221a\nthat H has a simple zero along D, as expected on general grounds. In fact locally\n62\n\n\fH = H(s, s) = e2g |s|2, where g is function and s is a holomorphic section of the divisor\nbundle LD . Again, this was expected from arguments in [65], where the phase that\n\npairs with V , coming from the Wess-Zumino term in the action, was studied. Thus\nthe result presented here is rather complimentary to the discussion in reference [65].\nRestoring the factor of N, our computation hence shows that, formally at least, we\nhave the superpotential\nW = e\u2212N V (y; [\u03c9]) =\n\n\u221a\n\nH N = eN g |s|N .\n\n(5.47)\n\nThis is interpreted as a function of both the K\u00e4hler class, and also the position of the\nstack of M2 branes y \u2208 X, and generalizes the result (5.22) we derived explicitly for\nQ222 . A critical point of this W requires either a critical point of V , or else V = \u221e.\nSince V = \u2212 21 log H, the first case requires a critical point of the harmonic function\nlog H. By the maximum principle, notice that such a critical point cannot be either a\n\nlocal maximum or a local minimum of log H.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we set out to study abelian symmetries in the context of the AdS4 /CF T3\ncorrespondence. In particular, we considered gauge fields in AdS4 arising from KK reduction of the SUGRA potentials over the b2 (Y ) topologically non-trivial cycles (sometimes called Betti multiplets in the literature). In contrast to its better-understood\nAdS5 /CF T4 relative, the case at hand displays many more subtleties. The key difference resides in the fact that gauge fields in AdS4 admit, in a consistent manner,\nquantizations with either of two possible fall-offs at the boundary, implying that the\ngauge field can be dual to either a global symmetry or to a dynamical gauge field\nin the boundary CFT. From the bulk perspective, electric-magnetic duality in the\nfour-dimensional electromagnetic theory in AdS4 amounts to exchanging these two\nboundary fall-offs. In addition, from the bulk perspective one can shift the \u03b8-angle\nby 2\u03c0. Following [22], these two actions translate into particular operations on the\nboundary theory, the T and S operations reviewed in \u00a72.3, which then generate the\n\ngroup SL(2, Z). As stressed in the main text, these actions exchange different boundary conditions for the gauge field in AdS4 . Correspondingly, the dual boundary CFTs\nare different. Indeed, the whole of SL(2, Z) acts on the boundary conditions for the\nbulk gauge fields, leading in general to an infinite orbit of CFTs for each U(1) gauge\nsymmetry in AdS4 . Understanding the structure of such orbits is a very interesting\n63\n\n\fproblem which we postpone for further work.\nIn this paper we have contented ourselves with studying the particular case of M2\nbranes moving in C(Q111 ).14 In [26, 27] a U(N)4 dual theory was proposed and further\n\nstudied. In \u00a73.2 we proposed a choice of quantization for the abelian vector fields\nin the Betti multiplets such that precisely two U(1)s are ungauged, leading to the\ngauge group U(1)2 \u00d7 SU(N)4 . This leaves precisely two global symmetries that may\n\nbe identified with the two gauge fields coming from KK reduction of the SUGRA\nsix-form potential over five-cycles in Q111 . A key point in that identification is that\nthe corresponding boundary conditions in the bulk AdS4 allow for electric wrapped M5\nbrane states. These M5 branes can be easily identified in terms of the toric geometry of\nthe variety. Since the field theory realizes the minimal GLSM, it is then straightforward\nto identify the relevant U(1) symmetries in the QCS theory. In turn, this allows one\nto construct dual baryonic operators to such M5 branes. It is then natural to consider\nthe spontaneous breaking of such symmetries, where the operator dual to such an M5\nbrane acquires a VEV. We analyzed in detail such SSB in \u00a74. In particular, we have\n\nbeen able to compute the VEV of the baryonic condensate, with precise agreement\nwith field theory expectations. We stress that this is a non-trivial check of the dual\ntheory, as this suggests that it does admit an IR superconformal fixed point with the\ncorrect properties (specifically, R-charges) to be dual to M2 branes moving in C(Q111 ).\n\nAlong the lines of [29, 30], we have also been able to identify the Goldstone boson of this\nSSB. However, a comprehensive understanding of these resolutions in the context of the\nactions on the boundary conditions is still lacking. We postpone this for further work.\nAn interesting by-product of our computation is the finding of general expressions for\nwarped volumes in Calabi-Yau backgrounds, which are potentially of interest for other,\nsimilar computations.\nIt is natural to extend our analysis and consider backgrounds with exceptional sixcycles, as we briefly considered in \u00a75. Upon resolution, Euclidean M5 branes can be\nwrapped on these exceptional divisors. As opposed to the Type IIB counterpart case\nfor four-cycles, the M2 branes sourcing the background do not break SUSY any futher\nthan that preserved by the Euclidean brane in the resolution of the cone. Thus, in\nvery much the same spirit as in [33], it is natural to expect that these Euclidean branes\ncontribute as non-perturbative effects to the superpotential, even in the warped case.\nNevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of these issues is lacking. In this paper\n14\n\nAlthough as described in \u00a73.3, and further elaborated in \u00a7A, we expect similar results to hold for\nother toric isolated four-fold singularities with no exceptional six-cycles.\n\n64\n\n\fwe have however taken some first steps towards understanding this by computing the\nwarped volume of such branes. In particular we studied in detail the example C(Q222 ),\nwhich is a certain Z2 orbifold of C(Q111 ), as well as the Eguchi-Hanson manifold. In\nextending our findings to more general geometries we have found expressions which\nmight be of relevance in other contexts.\nIt is fair to say that the AdS4 /CF T3 correspondence still hides many mysteries. In\nthis paper we have scratched the surface of a few of them. We hope to be able to report\non further progress in the near future.\n\nAcknowledgments\nN.

All the faces of the polytope should be triangular.\n2. No lattice point should appear on faces or edges of the polytope.\nRecall that, as explained in \u00a72.3.2, the v\u03b1 vectors define an affine toric Calabi-Yau\nfour-fold. This definition is unique up to a unimodular transformation R, where R \u2208\nGL(4, Z) and det R = \u00b11. The vectors v\u03b1 may be written as v\u03b1 = (1, w\u03b1 ) for an\nappropriate choice of basis, where w\u03b1 \u2208 Z3 are the vertices of the three-dimensional\ntoric diagram. We will be interested in singularities with no vanishing six-cycles. We\n\nwill therefore demand, in addition, that no lattice points appear inside the polytope.\nThese toric diagrams are known as lattice-free polytopes. Such lattice-free polytopes\nin three dimensions are characterized by the fact that they have width one (see for\n65\n\n\fexample [66] and references therein). This is sometimes referred to as Howe's theorem,\nand is translated into the fact that the vertices of any lattice-free polytope are sitting\nin adjacent planes, i.e two lattice planes with no lattice points inbetween. These planes\ncan be chosen to be {z = 0} and {z = 1}.15 We want to start by showing that any\nthree-dimensional lattice-free polytope with more than four vertices describes a cone\nover a seven-dimensional simply-connected Sasakian manifold.\n\nFrom [47] we learn that the first and second homotopy groups of a toric Sasakian\nmanifold Y can be read straightforwardly from the toric diagram. The results for\nCalabi-Yau four-folds are\n\u03c01 (Y ) \u223c\n= Z4 /L ,\n\n\u03c02 (Y ) \u223c\n= Zd\u22124 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere L = spanZ {v\u03b1 } is the span over Z of the space of d external vertices of the toric\ndiagram. According to the Hurewicz Theorem H2 (Y ) \u223c\n=\n= \u03c02 (Y ) whenever H1 (Y ) \u223c\n\u03c01 (Y )/[\u03c01 (Y ), \u03c01 (Y )] is trivial. Therefore we see from (A.1) that for simply-connected\nSasakian manifolds b2 (Y ) = d \u2212 4, which is also the number of gauge groups in the\nminimal GLSM describing this geometry. This immediately suggests that the number\nof gauge nodes of the corresponding field theory, in the case that the latter is identified\nwith the minimal GLSM, is b2 (Y ) + 2. The two additional gauge nodes correspond to\nthe U(1)s which are not quotiented by in forming the moduli space. Note from (A.1)\nthat Y is simply-connected if and only if the external vertices span Z4 .\nFor polytopes with more than four vertices, three of the vertices must be co-planar.\nThus the matrix that describes four of the vertices can be written as follows\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 1 1 1\n\uf8ec 0 x x x \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1\n2\n3 \uf8f7\nA=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ed 0 y1 y2 y3 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 1\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere each column corresponds to a vertex (the x, y and z coordinates correspond to\nthe 2nd, 3rd and 4th rows, respectively). It is easy to see that by an R transformation\n\nthis can be brought into the form\n\n\uf8eb\n\n15\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\n\uf8f8\n\n(A.3)\n\nIf there are more vertices in one plane we choose it to be the {z = 0} plane without loss of\ngenerality.\n\n66\n\n\fTo see that the matrices A and B are related by an R transformation first note that\n| det(A\u22121 B)| = 1/|(x1 y2 \u2212 x2 y1 )|. The denominator of the latter is just the area of the\nparallelogram made up of two identical triangles defined by the first three columns in\nA. The area of this triangle is 1/2, as this is the condition for a lattice-free triangle in\ntwo dimensions.\nThe four vertices described by B span Z4 . Therefore any three-dimensional latticefree polytope with more than four vertices corresponds to a simply-connected Sasakian\nseven-manifold. This not always true for diagrams with four vertices, since in this case\neach plane can contain two points.\nTo start our analysis we note that lattice-free polytopes with 4 vertices correspond\nto a type of orbifold singularity that have been discussed intensively in the literature\n(see e.g. Section 3.1 in [71]). This is a supersymmetric C4 /Zk orbifold corresponding\nto an isolated singularity that cannot be resolved, with the orbifold weights in this\ncase being (1, \u22121, q, \u2212q) with gcd{k, q} = 1. As already noted in [12], if q > 1, for any\n\nchoice of U(1) isometry to reduce on, one can show that Y reduces in Type IIA to a\nspace with orbifold singularities. Therefore, it seems that these AdS4 \u00d7 Y solutions are\n\ndual to field theories with no Lagrangian description. Thus we are left with the ABJM\norbifolds, obtained by taking q = 1, for which there are of course already field theory\ncandidates.\nWe continue with the classification of diagrams with five vertices, where recall that\nwe have shown that the first four vertices are described by B. Since the fifth vertex\nshould be in the {z = 1} plane (to prevent a face with 4 vertices) it can be written\n\nas (1, x, y, 1) with x, y > 0.16 The only way to break the lattice-free condition would\nbe if there were points between (1, x, y, 1) and (1, 0, 0, 1). Thus we have to require\ngcd{x, y} = 1. This concludes the classification of polytopes with five vertices. There\n\nare no additional R transformations that connect between diagrams in this set; as we\nshow later, the corresponding GLSM charge matrix that describes this toric diagram\nis unique for any choice of x and y.\nToric diagrams with 6 vertices are potentially more complicated, although we note\nthat these include the Q111 example studied in detail in this paper. 6 vertices is also\nthe maximal number since, otherwise, it is not possible to arrange the vertices in two\nadjacent planes with the constraint that all faces are triangular.\n16\n\nAs can be easily seen from (A.4), toric diagrams with triangular faces obtained by picking other\nvalues of x and y are related by R transformations.\n\n67\n\n\fWe continue now with a discussion of the geometries that correspond to the polytopes\nobtained above. Recall that, given a toric diagram, one can recover the corresponding\nCalabi-Yau four-fold via Delzant's construction. In physics terms, this would be called\na GLSM description of the four-fold. Let us discuss the toric diagrams with five vertices\ndescribed above. The GLSM charge matrix can be computed by taking the null-space\nof the G-matrix, obtaining\nQt = (x + y, \u2212x, \u2212y, \u22121, 1) .\n\n(A.4)\n\nSince the GLSM charge matrix contains one gauge group, we find that the corresponding quiver should have 3 nodes. However, it is not possible to find a QCS field theory\nfor every value of x and y. First, note that there are no zero entries in Qt , therefore\nthere should be no adjoint fields in the quiver. The most general way to construct a\nquiver with 3 nodes and 5 fields with no adjoints, such that there is an equal number of\nin-going and out-going arrows at each node, is given in Figure 6. This quiver was also\n\nFigure 6: The unique quiver that contains 3 nodes, 5 fields and no adjoints.\ndiscussed in [67]. Since we are interested in field theories which reproduce the minimal\nGLSM, we must have a toric superpotential which vanishes in the abelian case. The\nnatural candidate is\nW = Tr \u01ebij Ci DCj AB ,\n(A.5)\nwhere \u01ebij is the usual alternating symbol.\nIn this theory the only contribution to the GLSM matrix comes from the D-term,\nwhich in this case reduces to\nQquiver = (\u2212k1 \u2212 k2 , \u2212k1 \u2212 k2 , k1 + k2 , k2, k1 ) ,\n68\n\n(A.6)\n\n\fNote that two of the entries are equal while in general there are no equal entries in\nQt . Therefore the only hope to reproduce Qt (up to an overall minus sign) is to choose\nk1 + k2 = \u00b1 1. Substituting this back into Qquiver we obtain\nQquiver = (\u2213 1, \u2213 1, \u00b1 1, \u00b1 1 \u2212 k1 , k1 ) .\n\n(A.7)\n\nObviously we can reproduce Qt only for x = 1 or y = 1. For other values, the\ngeometries are not captured by the quiver that we have written. Indeed, it seems that\nthe AdS4 \u00d7 Y spaces, where Y is the base of the corresponding isolated Calabi-Yau\nsingularity, reduce in Type IIA to singular spaces, for any choice of U(1) isometry on\nY . Thus the corresponding M2 brane theories apparently do not admit a Lagrangian\ndescription, according to [12].\n\nB\n\nGeometry of C(Q111) and its resolutions\n\nThe cone over Q111 is a non-complete intersection defined by 8 wi \u2208 C such that\nw1 w2 \u2212 w3 w4 = w1 w2 \u2212 w5 w8 = w1 w2 \u2212 w6 w7 = 0 ,\nw1 w3 \u2212 w5 w7 = w1 w6 \u2212 w4 w5 = w1 w8 \u2212 w4 w7 = 0 ,\nw2 w4 \u2212 w6 w8 = w2 w5 \u2212 w3 w6 = w2 w7 \u2212 w3 w8 = 0 .\nOne can check that these equations can be solved in general by taking\nw1\nw3\nw5\nw7\n\ni\n\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8+\u03c61 +\u03c62 +\u03c63 ) cos \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8+\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 \u2212\u03c63 ) cos \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8+\u03c61 +\u03c62 \u2212\u03c63 ) cos \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8+\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 +\u03c63 ) cos \u03b821\n\ncos \u03b822 cos \u03b823 ,\nsin \u03b822 sin \u03b823 ,\ncos \u03b822 sin \u03b823 ,\nsin \u03b822 cos \u03b823 ,\n\nw2\nw4\nw6\nw8\n\ni\n\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 \u2212\u03c63 ) sin \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 +\u03c62 +\u03c63 ) sin \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 +\u03c62 \u2212\u03c63 ) sin \u03b821\ni\n= \u03c1e 2 (\u03c8\u2212\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 +\u03c63 ) sin \u03b821\n\nsin \u03b822 sin \u03b823 ,\ncos \u03b822 cos \u03b823 ,\ncos \u03b822 sin \u03b823 ,\nsin \u03b822 cos \u03b823 .\n(B.1)\n\nSince the cone over Q111 is both Ricci-flat and K\u00e4hler the metric can be written as\ngmn\u0304 = \u2202m \u2202n\u0304 K, where K is the K\u00e4hler potential. In the singular case, the most general\nsuch K\u00e4hler potential which one could write, compatible with the SU(2)3 \u00d7 U(1)R\nsymmetry, is\nK = F (\u03c12 ) .\n\n(B.2)\n\nWe may resolve C(Q111 ) by blowing up a copy of CP1 \u00d7 CP1 , as explained in the main\ntext.

Thus we can construct the variety by starting with the wi holomorphic\ncoordinates and taking the desired orbifold. In particular, it follows that the metric is\njust that of C(Q111 ) with \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0].\nWe are interested in resolving this conical singularity. The computation of the metric\nis formally similar to that for C(Q111 ).

One can check very easily that\np\np\ndet g = r 3 (r 2 + 2a)(r 2 + 2b) det g\u0303 .\n\n(D.26)\n\nTherefore, if we denote x = (r, \u03be) and y = (r0 , \u03be0 ) we have\n\u221a\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b4 8 (x \u2212 y) = 3 2\n\u03b4 7 (\u03be \u2212 \u03be0 ) .\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r0 ) \u221a\n2\nr (r + 2a)(r + 2b)\ndet g\ndet g\u0303\n\n(D.27)\n\nUsing the completeness relation above we may hence write\n\u221a\n\nD.2\n\nX\n1\n1\n\u03b4(r\n\u2212\nr\n)\nYI (\u03be0 )\u2217 YI (\u03be) .\n\u03b4 8 (x \u2212 y) = 3 2\n0\nr (r + 2a)(r 2 + 2b)\ndet g\nI\n\n(D.28)\n\nAngular eigenfunctions in Q222\n\nSince C(Q222 ) is a Z2 orbifold of C(Q111 ) along \u03c8 it is clear that the local computation\n\nof the previous subsection will not be changed. Thus, we just have to take care of\nglobal issues. Recall that the wavefunctions in C(Q111 ) are\nYI = CI Jl1 ,m1 ,R (\u03b81 )Jl2 ,m2 ,R (\u03b82 )Jl3 ,m3 ,R (\u03b83 ) ei (m1 \u03c61 +m2 \u03c62 +m3 \u03c63 ) ei R\u03c8/2 .\n75\n\n(D.29)\n\n\fSince now \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], it is clear that the well-behaved YI will be those for which R\nis even; that is, R = 2 R\u0303. Therefore, dropping the tilde, the angular wavefunctions in\nC(Q222 ) are\nYI = CI Jl1 ,m1 ,R (\u03b81 )Jl2 ,m2 ,R (\u03b82 )Jl3 ,m3 ,R (\u03b83 ) ei (m1 \u03c61 +m2 \u03c62 +m3 \u03c63 ) ei R\u03c8 ,\n\n(D.30)\n\nsuch that\nAYI = \u2212EI YI ,\n\n(D.31)\n\nwith\nEI =\n\nD.3\n\n\u0010 2\n8 l1 (l1 + 1) 8 l2(l2 + 1) 8 l3 (l3 + 1)\n1\n1\n1 \u0011\n2\n.\n+\n+\n+\n8R\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nr2\nr 2 + 2a\nr 2 + 2b\nr 2 \u03ba r 2 r 2 + 2a r 2 + 2b\n(D.32)\n\nThe warp factor for Q111\n\nWe now want to use the results derived so far to compute explicitly the warp factor\nfor the resolution of the C(Q111 ) space. We will consider the stack of branes to be\nsitting on the exceptional locus, where both the U(1) fibre and the (\u03b81 , \u03c61 ) sphere\nshrink to zero size. This means that h = h(r, \u03b82 , \u03b83 ), which in turn implies that R and\nl1 in (D.19) vanish. Then, under these assumptions, the multi-index I takes the values\nI = {(l2 , m2 ), (l3 , m3 )}. Indeed, we will assume the branes are located at the north\npole of each of the two two-spheres. As such, we should consider also m2 = m3 = 0.\nTherefore, for such cases the angular eigenfunctions J A and J B coincide and reduce,\n\nfor each sphere, to Legendre polynomials\nJl,0,0 = 2 F1 (\u2212l, 1 + l; 1; sin2 \u03b82 ) = Pl (cos \u03b8) ,\n\n(D.33)\n\nsuch that for the case at hand where only l2 , l3 6= 0\nYl2 ,l3 = Cl2 ,l3 Pl2 (cos \u03b82 ) Pl3 (cos \u03b83 ) ,\n\n(D.34)\n\nand\n\n8 l2 (l2 + 1) 8 l3 (l3 + 1)\n+\n.\nr 2 + 2a\nr 2 + 2b\nThus, from (D.11) we see that the equation to solve reads\nEI =\n\n\u0011 \u0010 8 l (l + 1) 8 l (l + 1) \u0011\n(2\u03c0lp )6 N\n1 \u0010\n2 2\n3 3\n\u22121\n\u03ba\n\u03c8\n=\n\u2212\n\u2202r f \u2202r \u03c8I \u2212\n+\n\u03b4(r) .\nI\nf\nr 2 + 2a\nr 2 + 2b\nf\n76\n\n(D.35)\n\n(D.36)\n\n\fWe are interested in the simplified case in which, say, only b 6= 0. Under such assumption, also the (\u03b82 , \u03c62 ) sphere shrinks to zero, so that we can also consider l2 = 0.

To normalize these solutions we consider the\nr \u2192 \u221e limit in (E.27). We see that in this limit h \u2243 A |A0, 0, 0 |2 c2 /r 2 .

This reads\nZ p\ndet gD h d2 x ,\nS=\n\n(E.42)\n\nD\n\nwhere D is the blown-up S 2 = CP1 at r = c, and gD and h are the pull-backs of the\nmetric and warp factor to D, respectively. After substituting (E.27) and\n\ninto this expression one obtains\n\np\nc2\ndet gD = sin \u03b8 ,\n4\n\n(E.43)\n\nZ\nc2 X\n\u03c8l (c)\nY0, l, m (\u03bep )\u2217 Y0, l, m (\u03be) d2 \u03be .\nS=\n4\nD\n\n(E.44)\n\nl, m\n\nWe now proceed by evaluating the integral\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n2\n2 \u2212i m \u03c6p\nY0, l, m (\u03bep ) Y0, l, m (\u03be) d \u03be = |A0, l, m | e\nJl, m (\u03b8p )\nd\u03b8 d\u03c6 sin \u03b8 ei m \u03c6 Jl, m (\u03b8) .\nD\n\n(E.45)\n\nThe \u03c6 integral forces that only the m = 0 term contributes. Thus\nZ\nZ \u03c0\n\u2217\n2\n2\nY0, l, m (\u03bep ) Y0, l, m (\u03be) d \u03be = 2\u03c0 \u03b4m,0 |A0, l, 0 | Jl, 0 (\u03b8p )\nd\u03b8 sin \u03b8 Jl, 0 (\u03b8) .\nD\n\n0\n\n83\n\n(E.46)\n\n\fFurthermore, the Jl,0(\u03b8) are just Legendre polynomials in cos \u03b8. One can then see that\nall integrals are zero except for the l = 0 mode. Thus\nZ\nY0, l, m (\u03bep )\u2217 Y0, l, m (\u03be) d2\u03be = 4\u03c0 \u03b4m,0 \u03b4l,0 |A0, 0, 0 |2 .\n(E.47)\nD\n\nSo finally\nS = \u03c0 c2 |A0, 0, 0 |2 \u03c8< (c) .\n\n(E.48)\n\n\u03c8< (c) can be read from (E.38) together with the normalization at (E.41). Neglecting\nthe label p in rp we obtain our final extremely simple result:\nS = arctanh\n\nE.4\n\nc2\n.\nr2\n\n(E.49)\n\nHarmonic forms from the warped volume\n\nIn this subsection we show how to rederive the harmonic two-form, that was derived\nin the first subsection, using the warped volume just computed. As shown in the first\nsubsection, the two-form\n \u0304 \u03b2\n\u03b2\u0302 = \u2202 \u2202S\n\n(E.50)\n\n1\nc2\nS\u03b2 = i \u221a arctanh 2 .\nr\n\u03c0 2\n\n(E.51)\n\nis harmonic, where\n\nRecall here that r \u2265 c, with the exceptional divisor D = {r = c} being a copy of CP1 .\nMoreover, \u03b2\u0302 is normalized so that\nZ\n\u03b2\u0302 \u2227 \u22c6\u03b2\u0302 = 1 ,\n(E.52)\nXEH\n\nwhere XEH = O(\u22122) \u2192 CP1 is the Eguchi-Hanson manifold. The first claim is that\nthe correctly normalized Poincar\u00e9 dual to D = CP1 is\n\u03b2=\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03b2\u0302 .\n\n(E.53)\n\nIndeed, then\nZ\n\nXEH\n\n\u03b2 \u2227 \u22c6\u03b2 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nXEH\n\n84\n\n\u03b2\u2227\u03b2 =2 .\n\n(E.54)\n\n\fWe require the 2 here since this is the Euler number of the normal bundle to the\nexceptional CP1 . Thus, in our notation in the main text,\n\u221a\nc2\nr 2 \u2212 c2\n1\nlog H = (2\u03c0i) 2S\u03b2 = \u22122\u03c0 * arctanh 2 = log 2\n.\n(E.55)\n\u03c0\nr\nr + c2\n\u221a\nThe radial coordinate near to D = CP1 is \u03c1 = r \u2212 c, so that D is at \u03c1 = 0. Thus we\nsee that, near to D, log H blows up as log \u03c12 , precisely as claimed in the main text.\nAlso notice that \u03b2 may be written\n\u03b2=\u2212\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\nc2\nd r \u22122 \u03b7 .\n\u03c0\n\n(E.56)\n\n(d\u03c8 \u2212 cos \u03b8d\u03c6). Thus the mode \u03b2\u03bc = \u03b7 in this case, which in particular is\n\u221a\na Killing one-form. Thus \u03bc = 4 and hence 2 \u2212 n \u2212 \u03bd = \u2212\u03bd = \u2212 \u03bc = \u22122, which is\nthe power of r above. This confirms the claims about the asymptotic expansion in this\nHere \u03b7 =\n\ncase.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Gustavsson, \"Algebraic structures on parallel M2 branes,\" Nucl. Phys.
