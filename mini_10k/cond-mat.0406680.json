In this area, the quantum ferrimagnetic chains\n(QFC) have attracted considerable attention during the\nlast few years, because they exhibit a remarkable combination of ferromagnetic (F) and antiferromagnetic (AF)\nfeatures.1,2 In an attempt directed toward the synthesis and design of possible experimental realizations of\nQFC, a magnetostructural analysis of several bimetallic\nassemblies has been accomplished,3 since the mixed-spin\nchains afford their most simple and common representatives. Up to now, the dual aspect of QFC has been experimentally confirmed in the [NiCu(pba)(D2 O)3 ].2D2 O4\nand [MnCu(mal)2 (H2 O)4 ].2H2 O5 mixed-spin chains.\nIn addition to the mixed-spin chains, another class of\nthe QFC constitute the bond alternating chains (BAC)\nwith an unusual fashion of exchange bonds. From the\nexperimental point of view, the bond alternation in the\n1D polymeric assemblies demands at least two structurally nonequivalent superexchange paths in order to\nget a series of alternating exchange bonds. It should\nbe mentioned, however, that bond alternation may also\narise in a system with an uniform superexchange pathway as a result of the spin-Peierls phenomenon,6 spontaneous dimerization, which occurs when the elastic energy increase connected with the lattice distortion is\nlower than the corresponding magnetic energy gain arising from the dimerization. Hence, the recent discovery of\n\nthe\nfirst inorganic spin-Peierls compounds CuGeO3 7 and\n\u2032\n\u03b1 -NaV2 O5 8 gave rise to a number of theoretical works\ndevoted to the spin-1/2 AF-AF BAC.9\nAnother exciting field in molecular magnetism was\nopened up by Haldane's conjecture,10 which has already\nbeen experimentally verified in several AF nickel-based\nchains (for a review of Haldane gap compounds see Ref.\n11). As firstly pointed out by Hida,12 additional insight\ninto the striking properties of the spin-1 AF chain can\nbe acquired by analyzing the spin-1/2 F-AF BAC in\nthe strong-F-coupling limit.13 Accordingly, much effort\nhas been addressed to prepare polymeric complexes, in\nwhich the F-AF bond alternation should be realized. At\npresent, there exist several copper-based polymeric compounds that fulfill this requirement14,15,16,17,18,19,20 (see\nTable I) and Haldane-like behavior has indeed been undoubtedly proved to occur in (IPA)CuCl3 .16\nOf particular interest are also other BAC with more\npeculiar bond alternation, especially with a longer repeating unit of exchange bonds; namely, according to\nthe Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck rule,21 one may expect\nthe appearance of the magnetization plateau in any system with a longer period of the ground state. Of course,\nthis rule represents just a necessary condition for the\nplateau-state formation and does not directly prove its\nexistence in any specific model. The theoretical investigations focused on the magnetization process of the\nspin-1/2 F-F-AF BAC thus revealed another interesting\nfinding - the breakdown of the magnetization plateau.22\nWhen the ratio between F and AF coupling constants\nis strong enough in this system, the plateau state disappears from the magnetization curve. In agreement with\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: Several examples of one-dimensional copper-based\nchains with alternating F and AF interactions.\nChemical formula\n[Cu(TIM)]CuCl4\n(4-BzPip)CuCl3\n(IPA)CuCl3\n(DMA)CuCl3\n[Cu(bipy)(N3 )2 ]\n[Cu2 (Me2 Eten)2 (N3 )2 ] (N3 )2\n[Cu2 (ampy)2 (N3 )2 ] (N3 )2\n3CuCl2 .2Dx\nCu(3-Clpy)2 (N3 )2\n\nBond alternation\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-AF\nF-F-AF\nF-F-AF-AF\n\nRef.\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[23]\n[24]\n\nAbbreviations: TIM = 2,3,9,10-tetramethyl-1,3,8,10-tetraenecyclo-1,4,8,11-tetraazatetradecane; 4-BzPip = 4-benzylpiperidinium (1+) ion; IPA = isopropylammonium (1+) ion; DMA =\ndimethylammonium (1+) ion; bipy = bipyridine; Dx = 1,4-dioxane;\n\u2032\nMe2 Eten = N,N-dimethyl-N -ethylethylendiamine; ampy = 1-(2aminoethyl)pyrrolidine.\n\nledge, there have been reported only a few rigorous results for the spin-1/2 F-F-AF-AF BAC obtained by applying the exact diagonalization method for a finite-size\nHeisenberg cluster25,26,27,28 and any further more comprehensive studies have not been reported in the literature hitherto.32\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In the next\nsection, we shall provide the detailed description of the\nmodel system and then, the basic ideas of transformation\nprocedure will be presented. This is followed by the presentation of the most interesting results. An exhaustive\nsurvey of results for several thermodynamic quantities\nin the zero as well as non-zero external field is reviewed\nin Section IIIA, while a comparison with the relevant experimental data is included in Section IIIB. Finally, some\nconcluding remarks are drawn in Section IV.\n\nII.\n\nthis finding, there has not been found any plateau in the\nlow-temperature magnetization curve of 3CuCl2 .2Dx,23\nwhich is regarded as a typical example of the spin-1/2\nF-F-AF BAC with the strong F and weak AF coupling.\nThe versatility of the azido ligand in bridging the magnetic ions in various fashions is nicely demonstrated in\nthe copper-based compound Cu(3-Clpy)2 (N3 )2 ,24 hereafter abbreviated as CCPA. There is a strong evidence that this compound can be regarded as a\nspin-1/2 tetramer chain with the F-F-AF-AF bond\nalternation.25,26,27,28 However, the 1D nature of the\nCCPA can be attributed to a sufficient separation between chains, which is ensured by the large steric hindrance of the bulky 3-Clpy ligands (see Fig. 1a). The peculiar F-F-AF-AF sequence of the exchange bonds arises,\non the other hand, on account of two kinds of bridging\nfashions of the azido group: the magnetic Cu2+ ions are\nlinked either in a double end-on, or in an end-on and\nend-to-end bridging fashion. It is quite well established29\nthat the end-on bridges are usually associated with the F\ncoupling (with exception when the bridging angle is too\nlarge), while the end-to-end bridges are responsible for\nthe AF coupling. The complete magnetic studies of the\nCCPA have been performed by Hagiwara and co-workers:\nfor a powder sample high-field magnetization and the\nsusceptibility measurements were reported,25 while for\na single-crystal sample the high-field magnetization and,\nsusceptibility are known,26 as well as the specific heat27\nand electron-spin resonance28 data.\nThe primary purpose of this work is to provide a detailed description to the thermodynamic properties of\nthe spin-1/2 F-F-AF-AF BAC by means of a simplified Ising-Heisenberg model suggested in our preliminary\nreport.30 Due to the simplicity of the proposed Hamiltonian as well as its low-dimensionality, an accurate analytical treatment for the complete set of thermodynamic\nquantities can be elaborated within an exact mapping\ntransformation technique.31 To the best of our know-\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nA fragment of the CCPA crystal structure is depicted\nin Fig. 1a. Apparently, there are three nonequivalent positions of the Cu2+ ions due to two different kinds of azido\nbridges. To match the structural situation from the magnetic viewpoint, Fig. 1b schematically reproduces the\nmagnetic structure of CCPA: the sites interacting purely\nvia the F interaction JF are denoted as the Cu1 sites, the\nsites coupled via both F as well as AF interaction as the\nCu2 sites, and finally, the sites coupled purely through\nthe AF interaction JAF are labeled as the Cu3 sites. As\na consequence of the structural differences, one also has\nto assume various g-factors g1 , g2 , and g3 at the Cu1,\nCu2, and Cu3 sites, respectively.\nIt is worthwhile to say that the supposed magnetic\nstructure can also be identified as a ferromagnetic chain,\nthe bonds of which are decorated by the AF trimers\n(Fig. 1b). Owing to this fact, it is very advisable\nto assume that the F interaction JF has an Ising-type\ncharacter, whereas the AF interaction JAF may have\nthe more general form of an anisotropic Heisenberg coupling (the detailed discussion will be given in Section\nIII). Under the circumstances, the model under consideration can be exactly treated by applying a generalized decoration-iteration mapping transformation.30 Actually, this mapping procedure has been proved to be\nvery useful in investigating several mixed-bond IsingHeisenberg models, some of the present authors already\nobtained within this scheme exact results for the trimerized Ising-Heisenberg linear chain,33 the Ising-Heisenberg\ndiamond chain34 , and some decorated Ising-Heisenberg\nplanar models.35 In what follows, we will refer to the\nCu1 magnetic sites as to the Ising-type sites, whereas the\nCu2 and Cu3 sites will be denoted as the Heisenberg-type\nsites.\nLet us write the total Hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 FF-AF-AF Ising-Heisenberg chain comprised of 4N magnetic sites. By imposing a periodic boundary condition\n(S4N +1 = S1 ), the total Hamiltonian of the system takes\n\n\f3\nthe form:\nH = JAF\n\nN\nX\n\nObviously, the different bond Hamiltonians commute\nwith respect to each other, hence, the partition function\nZ can be partially factorized into products of the bond\npartition functions Zk :\n\n[(S4k\u22123 , S4k\u22122 )\u2206 + (S4k\u22122 , S4k\u22121 )\u2206 ]\n\nk=1\n\n\u2212 JF\n\nN\nX\n\nz\nz\nz\nz\n[S4k\u22121\nS4k\n+ S4k\nS4k+1\n] \u2212 B1\n\nk=1\n\n\u2212 B2\n\nN\nX\n\nN\nX\n\nz\nS4k\n\nk=1\n\nz\nz\n(S4k\u22121\n+ S4k\u22123\n) \u2212 B3\n\nk=1\n\nN\nX\n\nz\nS4k\u22122\n,\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere (Si , Sj )\u2206 = \u2206(Six Sjx + Siy Sjy ) + Siz Sjz , Si\u03b1 (\u03b1 =\nx, y, z) marks the spatial components of the spin-1/2 operator at the ith lattice point and various on-site magnetic fields Bj = gj \u03bcB B (j = 1, 2, 3) have been introduced in order to distinguish the g-factors at the Cu1,\nCu2 and Cu3 sites. The first summation accounts for\nthe nearest-neighbor AF Heisenberg coupling (JAF > 0),\n\u2206 is the spatial anisotropy in this interaction, and the\nsecond summation accounts the nearest-neighbor F Ising\ncoupling (JF > 0). Other quantities have the usual\nmeaning: \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton and B the external\nmagnetic field.\nFor convenience, the total Hamiltonian (1) P\ncan be\nrewritten as a sum of bond Hamiltonians H = k Hk ,\nwhere each bond Hamiltonian Hk involves all the interaction terms associated with the kth AF Heisenberg trimer\n(Fig. 1b):\nHk = JAF [(S4k\u22123 , S4k\u22122 )\u2206 + (S4k\u22122 , S4k\u22121 )\u2206 ]\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\u2212 JF (S4k\u22124\nS4k\u22123\n+ S4k\u22121\nS4k\n) \u2212 B3 S4k\u22122\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\u2212 B2 (S4k\u22121 + S4k\u22123 ) \u2212 B1 (S4k\u22124 + S4k\n)/2.

(4), which must be valid for any combination of spin states of the S4k\u22124 and S4k Ising spins.\nIn consequence of that, the mapping parameters can be\nobtained following the standard procedure31,33,34,35 from\nthe expressions:\nA4 = V1 V2 V32 , \u03b2R = ln(V1 V2 /V32 ), \u03b2H0 = ln(V1 /V2 ),\n(16)\nwhere the functions V1 , V2 and V3 have a physical meaning of the bond partition function (4), when taking into\naccount all the particular spin combinations of the S4k\u22124\nand S4k Ising spins. These, however, modify merely the\neffective coupling constants (5)-(7) implicitly contained\nin Eq. (4). Thus, the functions V1 , V2 , and V3 are definitely determined by this set of expressions:\nV1 = Zk , if: J1+\nJ2+\nV2 = Zk , if: J1+\nJ2+\nV3 = Zk , if: J1+\nJ2+\n\n= JF + 2B2 + B3 ,\nJ1\u2212 = 0,\n= JF + 2(B2 \u2212 B3 );\n(17)\n\u2212\n= \u2212JF + 2B2 + B3 , J1 = 0,\n= \u2212JF + 2(B2 \u2212 B3 );\n(18)\n= 2B2 + B3 ,\nJ1\u2212 = JF ,\n= 2(B2 \u2212 B3 ).\n(19)\n\nWhen substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (3), the transformation Eq. (4) maps the original F-F-AF-AF IsingHeisenberg BAC on the uniform spin-1/2 Ising chain with\nthe effective nearest-neighbor exchange coupling R and\nthe magnetic field H0 . As a result, the partition function\nZ of the Ising-Heisenberg BAC can be directly related\nto the partition function Z0 of the corresponding Ising\nchain:\nZ = AN Z0 (\u03b2, R, H0 ).\n\n(20)\n\nCertainly, similar mapping relations can be established\nalso for other thermodynamic quantities. For instance,\nthe Gibbs free energy G of the Ising-Heisenberg BAC can\nbe calculated from the relevant expression of the Gibbs\nfree energy G0 of the corresponding spin-1/2 Ising chain:\nG = G0 (\u03b2, R, H0 ) \u2212 N kB T ln(A).\n\n(21)\n\nSince an exact solution for the spin-1/2 Ising chain was\nknown a long time ago,36 the above equation can serve as\n\nthe basic generating equation from which all thermodynamic quantities can be extracted. Here, we shall restrict\nourselves to the analysis of the magnetization, susceptibility and specific heat. For the spin only value of the\non-site magnetization at the magnetically nonequivalent\nCu1, Cu2 and Cu3 positions, we shall introduce this simple notation:\nz\nm1 = h\u015c4k\ni,\n\nz\nm2 = h\u015c4k\u22121\ni,\n\nz\nm3 = h\u015c4k\u22122\ni,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the symbol h...i stands for a standard canonical\naverage over the ensemble defined by the Hamiltonian\n(1). In view of this notation, the total magnetization\nnormalized per one Cu2+ ion can be expressed as follows:\nm = \u03bcB (g1 m1 + 2g2 m2 + g3 m3 )/4.\nFinally, we briefly mention the basic thermodynamic\nrelations from which all the analyzed quantities have\nbeen calculated after straightforward but a little bit\nlengthly calculations. The on-site magnetization can be\nobtained by differentiating the Gibbs free energy with\nrespect to the particular magnetic fields:\nm1 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202G\n1 \u2202G\n1 \u2202G\n, m2 = \u2212\n, m3 = \u2212\n, (23)\nN \u2202B1\n2N \u2202B2\nN \u2202B3\n\nwhile the susceptibility and specific heat have been obtained as the second derivatives of the Gibbs potential\nusing the standard thermodynamic relations:\n\u03c7=\u2212\n\n\u2202 2G\n,\n\u2202B 2\n\nand\n\nC = \u2212T\n\n\u22022G\n.\n\u2202T 2\n\n(24)\n\nIt should be stressed that the explicit form for these quantities is too cumbersome to write it down here; however,\nit can be obtained from the authors on request.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nBefore proceeding to a discussion of the most interesting results, the model reliability should be checked in\nconnection with its possible application to interpret the\nexperimental data on CCPA, because a danger of overinterpretation is inherent in any approximation. At first\nglance, we have made in our model a very crude conjecture in that the F interaction JF was approximated by\nan Ising-type coupling although all Cu2+ ions are nearly\nisotropic, and whence, the Heisenberg interaction would\nbe more appropriate. With regard to this, Fig. 2 illustrates a comparison between the on-site magnetization of the Ising-Heisenberg BAC and that of the corresponding pure Heisenberg BAC obtained from the exact diagonalization method for a finite-size cluster of 12\nsites.26 It should be pointed out that the low-temperature\n(kB T /JAF = 0.05) magnetization curve provides the best\nindependent test of the model reliability, since it reflects\nmagnetization near the ground state, where the clearest manifestation of the quantum fluctuations should be\nexpected to occur.\n\n\f5\nIt is quite surprising that there is such an excellent\nagreement between the two theories: the total magnetization (for clarity not shown here, but see for instance\nFig. 4) exhibits a steep increase from zero field followed\nby a magnetization plateau and finally, there appears a\nsecond steep increase near the transition field toward a\nfully polarized state. Strictly speaking, there is no real\nphase transition at any finite temperature; however, the\nlow-temperature magnetization curve shed light on what\nhappens in the ground state: the plateau state should\nreflect the ground-state phase and the field-induced transition to the fully saturated phase takes indeed place in\nthe zero-temperature limit. Moreover, the magnetic order at the plateau state has a typical feature of quantum\nferrimagnet, in fact, one finds here a substantial quantum reduction of the magnetization m2 and m3 at the\nCu2 and Cu3 sites even though the magnetization m1\n(Cu1 site) retains its saturation value. It means, among\nother matters, that the spin deviations cannot propagate\nthrough these sites and hence, they are strictly localized\nwithin the AF trimers. This explains also the remarkable\nagreement between both the theories, since the quantum\nfluctuations are in our model artificially restricted to the\nAF trimers because of the presence of the Ising spins.\nThe most obvious difference between the magnetization curve of the Ising-Heisenberg BAC and the pure\nHeisenberg BAC can be thus found in the vicinity of\nthe zero field, where the on-site magnetization of the\nformer reaches their plateau values more rapidly. Apparently, this distinction can be attributed to the more\n\"susceptible\" character of the Ising spins, whereby their\nHeisenberg counterparts achieve the plateau values more\nrapidly on behalf of the local field produced just by the\nIsing spins. With this in mind, small systematic discrepancies should be expected to occur especially in the\nregion where both B \u2192 0 and T \u2192 0, but, without loss\nof the qualitative agreement.\nWhy the Cu1 sites represent a \"barrier\" for the spin\ndeviations also in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg F-F-AF-AF\nBAC still remains an open question. Although the origin\nof this outstanding feature could be naively understood\nas a general feature of the spins coupled by the F interactions only, this suggestion is in an obvious contradiction\nwith Hida's results for the spin-1/2 F-F-AF BAC.22 As\na matter of fact, the total magnetization of this system\nvaries smoothly with increasing magnetic field even in the\nground state, which implies that the spin deviations are\ndelocalized over the whole chain and thus, there is a certain quantum reduction also at purely ferromagnetically\ncoupled sites.\n\nA.\n\nSurvey of theoretical results\n\nIn this part, an extensive survey of theoretical results\nwill be presented in order to enable deep insight into\nthe magnetic behavior of the system under investigation.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we shall firstly suppose equal\n\ng-factors at the Cu1, Cu2, and Cu3 positions, i. e. g1 =\ng2 = g3 = g.\nWe start our discussion with the analysis of the ground\nstate. Below some critical external magnetic field, the\nground state exhibits an interesting ferrimagnetic order,\nwhich can be characterized by the following values of the\nground-state magnetization:\n1\n,\n2\n\ni\n1h\n1 + JF /JAF\n1+ p\n,\n4\n(1 + JF /JAF )2 + 8\u22062\n1 + JF /JAF\n1\n1\nm\n= , (25)\nm3 = \u2212 p\n,\n2 (1 + JF /JAF )2 + 8\u22062\nms\n2\n\nm1 =\n\nm2 =\n\nwhere ms labels the saturation magnetization normalized\nper one Cu2+ ion. As already mentioned in the preceding\npart, the magnetization m1 retains in the ground state\nits saturation value in contrast to the magnetization m2\nand m3 , which show obvious quantum reduction. It is\nquite evident that the stronger the exchange anisotropy\n\u2206, the greater the reduction of the magnetization m2\nand m3 . On the other hand, the quantum reduction of\nthe magnetization completely vanishes in the Ising limit\n\u2206 \u2192 0, when the ground state exhibits a \"classical\" ferrimagnetic order \u2191\u2191\u2193\u2191 . . . (Cu1Cu2Cu3Cu2...) of a rather\ntrivial nature.\nAs expected, the ferrimagnetic system undergoes a\nfield-induced metamagnetic transition toward the fully\nsaturated phase under the certain magnetic field. It can\nbe readily proved that the transition field Bt is given\nunder the condition:\n1\u0010\ng\u03bcB Bt /JAF =\n3 \u2212 JF /JAF +\n4\n\u0011\np\n+ (1 + JF /JAF )2 + 8\u22062 . (26)\nFor illustration, Fig. 3 displays the ground-state phase\ndiagram in the JF \u2212 B plane for several values of the exchange anisotropy \u2206. As one can see, increasing strength\nof the F coupling JF generally reinforces the gradual\ndecline of the transition field. Thereby, the pure Ising\nlimit (\u2206 = 0) represents the only exceptional case when\nthe magnitude of the transition field does not change as\nthe ratio JF /JAF varies. It can be easily understood\nthat the metamagnetic transition arises in this particular case from a single flip of the central (Cu3) spin of\neach AF trimer, which occurs when the exchange energy\nof JAF is thoroughly balanced by the external magnetic\nfield (g\u03bcB Bt = JAF ).\nThe situation becomes much more complex on considering the nonzero exchange anisotropy \u2206. Due to the\nquantum fluctuations, the spin oriented in an opposite\ndirection with respect to the external field is no longer\nrigidly connected with the central spin of the AF trimer,\nbut is collectively held by the entire trimer. In other\nwords, the reversed spin is delocalized over the whole AF\ntrimer and consequently there is a non-zero probability\nthat the side (Cu2) spins of the trimer are aligned opposite to the field direction. Naturally, this must lead\n\n\f6\nto the enhancement of the exchange energy between the\nferromagnetically coupled Cu2 side spins and the fully\npolarized Cu1 spins. In consequence of that, it is quite\nconspicuous that the suppression of the transition field\ncan be explained in terms of the energetic destabilization\nof the quantum ferrimagnetic order, which occurs when\nJF /JAF increases.\nNow, let us turn our attention to the magnetic behavior at finite temperatures. In Fig. 4 we plot the total\nmagnetization scaled in g\u03bcB units against the dimensionless magnetic field (g\u03bcB B/JAF ) for a few temperatures. It should be pointed out that the magnetization\ncurve starts at any finite temperature from zero according to the one-dimensional character of the spin system.\nThe sharp stepwise magnetization curve observable in the\nzero-temperature limit is, however, gradually smeared\nout as the temperature is raised from zero. Actually,\nthe conversion toward the fully saturated phase does not\noccur merely at one precise value of the transition field,\nbut is smudged over a finite range of the fields. In addition, the temperature-induced fluctuations greatly shrink\nalso the width of the magnetization plateau and above a\ncertain temperature, the plateau state completely disappears from the magnetization curve. By any means, Fig.\n4 provides further convincing evidence that the observed\nmagnetization plateau emerges, under the assumption of\nthe uniform g-factors, exactly at one-half of the saturation magnetization [see also Eq. (25)].\nThe variation of the field-induced magnetization with\nthe temperature (Fig. 5) is also interesting on account\nof the magnetically ordered ground state. At low magnetic fields, the total magnetization tends abruptly to\nzero as the temperature increases. Nevertheless, one\nfinds here also a noticeable temperature-induced increase\nof the magnetization within a range of moderate fields,\nwhen the total magnetization shows a broad maximum\nresulting from a vigorous thermal excitations of the Cu3\nspins and smaller thermal excitations of the Cu2 spins.\nHowever, when the magnetic field exceeds the transition\nfield given by the condition (26), the total magnetization\nmonotonically decreases with increasing temperature as\nit already starts from its maximum value.\nThe thermal dependence of the zero-field susceptibility\ntimes temperature (\u03c7T ) data is displayed in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the \u03c7T product exhibits a round minimum\nupon cooling and then diverges under further temperature suppression. As already discussed in several papers concerned with the QFC,2 a thermal dependence\nof this type reveals a ferromagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic\ncrossover. Really, the temperature variation of the \u03c7T\ndata is in general a monotonically decreasing function for\nferromagnets, but monotonically increasing for antiferromagnets. In this respect, the marked low-temperature divergence of the susceptibility emerges markedly because\nof the gapless F excitations from the magnetically ordered ground state. The position of the round minimum,\non the other hand, designates the temperature above\nwhich the gapped excitations of the AF nature overhelm\n\nthe gapless excitations originating from JF . In accordance with the above statement, the round minimum\nflattens as the ratio JF /JAF strengthens and simultaneously its position is shifted toward higher temperatures.\nAs far as the magnetic susceptibility at nonzero fields\nis concerned (Fig. 7), the \u03c7T always initiates from zero\nbecause of the energy gap opened by the magnetic field.\nHowever, the thermal dependence of the \u03c7T data shows\nat weak fields a dramatic increase until it reaches a sharp\nmaximum, which is followed by the familiar round minimum of the same origin, as already discussed by the\nzero-field susceptibility. The appearance of the additional sharp peak can obviously be related to a thermal instability of the magnetically ordered system, because already a small temperature change necessitates a\nhuge variation of the magnetization at low fields (see Fig.\n5). As a matter of fact, the \u03c7T product rises steadily\nwith the temperature at sufficiently strong fields, since\nthe thermal fluctuations are not strong enough to induce a simultaneous excitation of a large number of spins.\nThus, an interesting thermal dependence of the susceptibility appears for strong magnetic fields just around\nthe transition to the fully polarized state. Under these\ncircumstances, the T -\u03c7T plot exhibits a rapid increase\nover a small temperature range, which is subsequently\nfollowed by a narrow plateau that continuously passes\ninto a slowly repeating increase of the susceptibility (see\nthe curve g\u03bcB B/JAF = 1.4).\nTo receive a complete picture of the thermodynamics, the thermal variations of the specific heat are plotted in Figs. 8 and 9. When considering the zero-field\ncase (Fig. 8), the specific heat displays as a function\nof the temperature a remarkable double-peak structure.\nThere are strong indications that the first sharper peak\nobserved at lower temperature originates from the F excitations: the peak becomes wider as the ratio JF /JAF\nincreases and is shifted to higher temperatures notwithstanding its almost constant height. Under the assumption of dominant F coupling constant (JF /JAF > 1.0),\nthe low-temperature peak is to a large extent superimposed on the second broader maximum that occurs at a\nlittle bit higher temperature. Obviously, the round hightemperature maximum can be thought of as the usual\nSchottky-type maximum, which has a tendency to be enhanced in magnitude with increasing JF /JAF . When\ncomparing the results displayed in Fig. 8 with those\nof the pure Heisenberg F-F-AF-AF BAC obtained using the exact diagonalization method27 or the transfermatrix renormalization group32 , an excellent agreement\nis found as far as the high-temperature maxima of both\nthese models are concerned. The only difference thus\nrests in the height of the low-temperature peak which\nis, due to the Ising approximation of JF , roughly threetimes higher for the Ising-Heisenberg BAC compared to\nthat of the pure Heisenberg BAC (see for instance the\ninsert of Fig. 4 depicted in Ref. 32).\nThe situation becomes even much more interesting on\napplying a magnetic field (Fig. 9). The effect of a\n\n\f7\nsmall magnetic field is to increase the height of the lowtemperature peak and to move it toward higher temperatures (see the case g\u03bcB B/JAF = 0.1). This result is\ntaken to mean that under a certain field both maxima\ncoalesce and consequently, the specific heat exhibits a\nsingle nonrounded maximum as shown for g\u03bcB B/JAF =\n0.2. By an additional increase of the field strength, the\nspecific heat curve gradually loses its irregular profile\nand the overall trend is that the Schottky-type maximum drops in magnitude and moves to higher temperatures. Apart from this rather trivial finding, the doublepeak specific heat curve can be recovered for the fields\nclose to the transition to the fully saturated phase (e.g.\ng\u03bcB B/JAF = 1.4). It should be mentioned, however,\nthat the height of the low-temperature peak is in this\ncase considerably smaller than that of the zero-field specific heat. Although the external field spreads also this\n\nlow-temperature peak until it completely merges with the\nSchottky-type maximum, the change of the peak position occurs strikingly without any significant change of\nthe peak height (for clarity, this effect is not shown here).\nFinally, it should be stressed that the observed behavior\nof the specific heat is not a generic feature of the special class of the Ising-Heisenberg BAC, nevertheless, it\nhas already been recognized also in the pure Ising BAC\n(compare with Figs. 4 and 8 from Ref. 37).\nWe conclude our survey of the thermodynamic properties by considering the nonuniformity of the gfactors at the structurally and therefore also magnetically nonequivalent Cu1, Cu2 and Cu3 positions (i.e.\ng1 6= g2 6= g3 ). Let us firstly focus on the ground-state\nbehavior. The most interesting finding to emerge here is\nthat the ground-state magnetization depend on the field\nstrength, whenever g2 6= g3 :\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF\n1+ p\n,\n4\n[1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF ]2 + 8\u22062\n1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF\n1\n,\nm3 = \u2212 p\n2 [1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF ]2 + 8\u22062\ng1 + g2\ng2 \u2212 g3\n1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF\nm\np\n=\n+\n.\nms\ng1 + 2g2 + g3\ng1 + 2g2 + g3 [1 + JF /JAF + 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 )/JAF ]2 + 8\u22062\nm1 =\n\n1\n,\n2\n\nm2 =\n\nIt is quite apparent from Eqs. (27) that the field dependence of the total magnetization comes from the corresponding field variations of the on-site magnetization\nm2 and m3 . Another noticeable feature to observe here\nis that the magnetic field suppresses (raises) the quantum reduction of the magnetization m2 and m3 as far as\ng2 > g3 (g2 < g3 ). Since the condition 2\u03bcB B(g2 \u2212 g3 ) \u226a\nJF + JAF holds for most of the experimentally accessible fields and g-factors, the total magnetization should\nbe nearly linearly dependent on the magnetic field with\na linear term proportional to the difference \u03b4g = g2 \u2212 g3 .\nNaturally, the greater the magnitude of the external field\nand \u03b4g, the stronger deviations from the linearity should\nemerge.\nSome typical examples of the ground-state magnetization curves are depicted in Fig. 10 under the assumption\ng2 > g1 = g3 (Fig. 10a) and g3 > g1 = g2 (Fig.10b).\nThese results can serve as evidence that the magnetization curve does not show an exact plateau, but rises\nsteadily with the external field. It is also worthy to note\nthat these \"magnetization plateaus with a finite slope\"\n(when plotted in the full range with respect to the saturation magnetization, they are hardly discernible from\nthe exact plateaus within the reasonable values of the gfactors) do not occur precisely at half of the saturation\nmagnetization (m/ms = 1/2), but they are shifted to\nhigher values if g2 > g1 = g3 (Fig. 10a) and respectively,\n\n(27)\n\nto the smaller values if g3 > g1 = g2 (Fig. 10b).\nTo enable an independent check of the field dependence\nof the total magnetization, the temperature variation of\nthe susceptibility has been examined in detail. The typical thermal dependences of the susceptibility are plotted\nin Fig. 11 for g3 > g1 = g2 and some selected external fields. Generally, the susceptibility versus temperature plot can be characterized by a round maximum,\nwhich flattens and shifts to higher temperatures when\nincreasing the external field. The low-temperature part\nof the susceptibility is displayed on an enlarged scale in\nthe inset. It turns out that the susceptibility does not\ncompletely vanish as the temperature approaches zero;\nnevertheless, it tends toward a small but finite value.\nThis result provides a confirmation of the striking fielddependent magnetization and moreover, it also clearly\ndemonstrates a gapless excitation spectrum above the\nground state.\n\nB.\n\nComparison with the experimental data\n\nAt this stage, the results obtained from the exact mapping on the Ising-Heisenberg BAC will be compared with\nthe available experimental data for a single-crystal sample of the CCPA. It should be mentioned here that all the\nexperimental data used in our further analysis have al-\n\n\f8\nready been reported in earlier publications26,27 to which\nthe interested reader is referred for more experimental\ndetails.\nIn order to fit the experimental data of the CCPA,\nwe have to consider the six fitting parameters: the exchange constant JAF /kB , the exchange anisotropy \u2206, the\nalternation ratio JF /JAF and the three g-factors g1 , g2\nand g3 . Note that the best fit of the magnetization and\nthe susceptibility data obtained under the restriction of\nequal g-factors (g1 = g2 = g3 ) as well as isotropic exchange JAF (\u2206 = 1.0), have already been published by\nthe present authors in our preliminary report (see Fig. 3\nin Ref. 30). Unless specifically mentioned, the exchange\nanisotropy will again be fixed to the purely isotropic case\n\u2206 = 1.0, because the experimental measurements on the\nsingle-crystal sample do not reveal any significant spatial\ndependence: the spatial directions parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis seem to be almost equivalent.26\nIn Fig. 12, the low-temperature magnetization curve of\nCCPA measured in the pulsed (Fig. 12a) and static (Fig.\n12b) magnetic fields is compared with the relevant theoretical prediction (the fitting parameters are indicated\nin the figures). It turns out, however, that the average\ng-factor must be approximately gav \u2261 (g1 +2g2 +g3 )/4 \u223c\n2.15 in order to get the correct saturation magnetization\n(Fig. 12a). Even under this confinement, several combinations of the g-factors provide almost the same fit to\nthe experimental magnetization curve. For illustrative\npurposes, we choose the one with the smallest value of\nthe g1 -factor to lower the susceptibility of the Cu1 spins,\nbecause the most obvious discrepancies between the theory and the experiment emerge near zero field due to\nthe more \"susceptible\" character of the Ising spins, as\nalready discussed earlier.\nUnfortunately, it is beyond experimental verification\nto find out from the existing data set, whether the magnetization increase observed within the plateau region\nappears exclusively on account of the finite-temperature\neffect, or is partially caused by the inequality g2 6= g3 .\nAlthough the former situation cannot be definitely ruled\nout, it is rather more acceptable that there is at least\na small contribution to the magnetization increase also\nfrom the difference between the g-factors. Nonetheless,\nthe final conclusion is complicated by different factors:\nthe magnetization curves in the static fields (Fig. 12b)\nare measured at higher temperatures and become quite\nnoisy above 15 T, while the available magnetization curve\nin the pulsed fields (Fig. 12a) show a relatively large hysteresis probably caused by the magnetocaloric effect.26\nThe thermal dependence of the zero-field susceptibility\ntimes temperature data is illustrated in Fig. 13. To obtain a reasonable accordance with the experimental measurement, slightly higher g-factors must be taken into\nconsideration in comparison with the ones acquired by\nthe fitting of the magnetization. Despite this fact, a\nquite impressive accordance can be achieved by rescaling\nthe average g-factor at about 4-5% of its magnetization\nvalue gav \u223c 2.15. As expected, the most apparent dis-\n\nagreement appears in the descending tail of the \u03c7T curve\nnearby the zero temperature, where the susceptibility divergence is reminiscent of the ferromagnetic Ising-type\ndivergence rather than the Heisenberg-type divergence.\nFinally, Fig. 14 shows the magnetic part of the specific\nheat as a function of the temperature for several magnetic\nfields. The corresponding theoretical predictions are also\nincluded; nevertheless, the specific heat can merely be fitted with a rather unacceptable precision even though the\nresults agree at least qualitatively. In order to situate the\nstriking low-temperature peak around 0.5 K, however, a\ndrastic reduction of the JF and JAF exchange parameters\nwas carried out. Even under this condition, the predicted\npeak is much more robust than observed experimentally\nand this feature remains valid also for any other combination of the JF and JAF coupling constants. Actually,\nthe height of the low-temperature peak does not significantly vary with the ratio JF /JAF as already shown in\nFig. 8.\nIt is quite obvious that the inconsistency in the fitting\nset for the specific heat and, respectively, the magnetization and susceptibility, indicates some insufficiency in the\nconsidered model based on the simple concept of the F-FAF-AF BAC. Notice that the basic problem that prevents\nobtaining an unique fitting set for all these quantities consists in reproducing the striking low-temperature peak of\nthe specific heat, which cannot be fitted within a reasonable accord neither under the assumption of the pure\nHeisenberg F-F-AF-AF BAC.27,32 A possible explanation for this peculiar inconsistency has recently been suggested by Lu et al.32 , who found a strong indication that\nthe striking low-temperature peak comes from the contribution of magnetic impurities. Until a higher-quality\nsample of CCPA is prepared and remeasured, however,\none cannot exclude the other possibility that this anomalous peak originates from the neglected higher-order interaction terms in the proposed Hamiltonian. Our detailed analysis shows that neither the nonuniformity of\ng-factors nor the exchange anisotropy of the JAF (\u2206) coupling constant, can resolve this inconsistency.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn the present article, the magnetic properties of the\nspin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg chain with regular F-F-AF-AF\nbond alternation have been investigated within the exact mapping transformation method. The results obtained from the mapping procedure are compared with\nthe results of the corresponding Heisenberg BAC26 and\nwith the experimental data of the CCPA compound,26,27\nwhich is regarded to be an experimental realization of\nthe spin-1/2 F-F-AF-AF BAC.\nIt should be emphasized that all characteristic quantum features observed in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg F-FAF-AF BAC25,26,27 are still present also in our simplified Ising-Heisenberg version: one finds here a substantial\nquantum reduction of the ground-state magnetization m2\n\n\f9\nand m3 at the Cu2 and Cu3 sites in addition to the fully\nsaturated ground-state magnetization m1 at the Cu1 site.\nPerhaps, the most striking finding stemming from our\nstudy is that there appears a rather unusual change from\nthe gapful to gapless excitation spectrum when converting the uniform g-factors at structurally non-equivalent\npositions to nonuniform ones. With regard to this, the\nmagnetization curve exhibits a real plateau under the\ncondition g2 = g3 only; for any other case the magnetization within the quantum ferrimagnetic phase (plateau\nstate) shows a weak field dependence.\nThe success of the simplified Ising-Heisenberg model in\nreproducing the measured data for CCPA is also quite remarkable. With the exception of the specific heat, where\nthe results agree at the qualitative level only, other thermodynamic quantities are relatively well reproduced. In\nfact, small systematic errors occur merely in the lowtemperature and weak-field region, where the approximation of the ferromagnetic coupling JF by the Ising-type\ninteraction plays the most essential role. It is worthwhile\nto mention, moreover, that the discrepancy found in the\nspecific heat fit cannot be resolved even if a pure Heisenberg F-F-AF-AF BAC is considered. Actually, very recent work of Lu et al.32 provided a strong indication that\nthe striking low-temperature peak of specific heat is being of extrinsic origin probably caused by the presence\nof magnetic impurities. However, further experimental\nmeasurements with high-quality samples of CCPA are\nrequired to clarify this issue. Finally, one should notice\n\nthat the simple concept of the Ising-Heisenberg F-F-AFAF BAC presented here can be rather straightforwardly\nextended to account for second-neighbor interactions, the\nantisymetric Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and/or\nmultispin interactions, which cannot be ruled out as a\npotential cause of the observed discrepancies until the\ninfluence of magnetic impurities will experimentally be\nconfirmed.\n\nElectronic address: jozkos@pobox.sk\nS.
