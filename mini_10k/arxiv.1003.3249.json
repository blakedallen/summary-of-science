Introduction\nBiological soft tissues encountered in clinical and pre-clinical imaging are mainly composed of atoms\nof light elements with low atomic numbers, and its elemental composition is nearly uniform with little\ndensity variations. The x-ray attenuation contrast is relatively poor, and cannot achieve satisfactory\nsensitivity and specificity [1, 2]. In contrast, x-ray phase-contrast provides a new mechanism for soft\ntissues imaging. The x-ray phase shift of soft tissues is about a thousand times greater than that of\nabsorption within the diagnostic x-ray energy range, achieving a greater signal-to-noise ratio than\nattenuation contrast images. Thus, phase-contrast imaging can reveal detailed structural variation in\nsoft tissues, offering a high contrast resolution between healthy and malignant tissues [3-5]. Moreover,\nthe phase-contrast imaging does not intrinsically rely on x-ray absorption in tissues. With increasing\nx-ray energy, photoelectric absorption of tissues decreases as 1 E 3 , while tissue phase shift decreases\n\nmuch slower only as 1 E . Phase imaging would significant reduce the deposited dose in tissues\ncomparing to absorption contrast imaging within hard x-ray spectral range[6].\n\n\fAs it is well known, the x-ray intensity variation is acquired by a detector, while the phase shift of\nx-ray passing through an object cannot be measured directly. X-ray Talbot interferometry has recently\nbeen proposed as a novel x-ray phase imaging method to efficiently extract quantitative differential\nphase information from the Moir\u00e9 pattern using a fringe scanning technique [4, 7]. However, the data\nacquisition procedure is quite time-consuming, resulting in an increasing radiation dose. The gratings\nwith large sizes and high slit aspects are difficult to fabricate and model, especially, the analyzer\nabsorption grating consists of Au pillars encased in epoxy and bounded using a frame. This fabrication\nprocess is prone to errors and hard to control in the case of gratings of large sizes and high aspects. Xray phase contrast is formed from the propagation of wave field in free space after interaction with the\nobject, creating a quantitative correspondence between the object and the recorded images, which can\nbe used to retrieve the phase shift induced by the object. Several phase retrieval methods in the Fresnel\ndiffraction regime are proposed, such as transport of intensity equation (TIE) method [8, 9], the\ncontrast transfer function (CTF) [10], a mixed approach between the CTF and TIE [11], and a general\ntheoretical formalism for the in-line phase-contrast imaging [12]. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to reconstruct x-ray differential phase shift of an object. The reconstruction method keeps a\nhigher-order accuracy comparing to the linearized approximation models, helping overcome the\nlimitation in the weak absorption scenario and the restriction of slow phase variation assumed in the\nconventional phase reconstruction techniques. Using several intensity measurements in Fresnel\ndiffraction region eliminate the nonlinear terms and simplify the phase retrieval to a linear model with\nrespect to the differential phase shift.\n2. Phase retrieval algorithm\n\nThe coherent x-ray-tissue interaction causes the x-ray wave phase change because of both x-ray\ndiffraction and refraction effects. The amount of the phase change is determined by the dielectric\nsusceptibility, or equivalently, by the refractive index of the tissue. The refractive index of x-ray is a\n\n\fcomplex form: n \uf03d 1 \uf02d \uf064 \uf02b i\uf062 , where the parameters \uf064 and \uf062 are the refractive index decrement and\nthe absorption index, respectively. \uf064 characterizes the x-ray phase shift, while \uf062 is related to the\nattenuation properties. It has been shown that \uf064 values (10\u22126\u201310\u22128) is about 1000 times greater than \uf062\n(10\u22129\u2013 10\u221211) in the biological soft tissue over the 10 keV-100 keV range [13]. This implies that\ntremendous improvement can be achieved in terms of the sensitivity of x-ray imaging to biological soft\ntissues if x-ray phase information is utilized. When an object is illuminated by a partially coherent xray beam, the wave-object interaction can be described as a transmittance function,\nu0 \uf028 r \uf029 \uf03d a \uf028 r \uf029 exp \uf0e9\uf0ebi\uf046 \uf028 r \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb \uf03d exp \uf0e9\uf0eb \uf02d B \uf028 r \uf029 \uf02b i\uf046 \uf028 r \uf029 \uf0f9\uf0fb\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r denotes the transverse coordinates \uf028 x, y \uf029 in the transverse plane relative to the propagation\ndirection z. The absorption B \uf028 r \uf029 and phase shift \uf046 \uf028 r \uf029 induced by the imaged object are the projections\nthrough the complex refractive index distribution. The phase change and attenuation of the x-ray beam\nafter passing through an object are given by [14]\n\uf046 \uf028r \uf029 \uf03d\n\n2\uf070\n\n\uf06c\n\n\uf0f2 \uf064 \uf028 r, z \uf029 dz ,\n\nB \uf028r \uf029 \uf03d\n\n4\uf070\n\n\uf06c\n\n\uf0f2 \uf062 \uf028 r, z \uf029 dz\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the x-ray wavelength.\nDue to phase shifts caused by an object, the wavefront of x-ray beam propagation is deformed.\nAccording to the Fresnel diffraction theory, the relationship between wave amplitudes in the transverse\nplane is described by the Fresnel transformation formula,\nuz \uf028r \uf029 \uf03d\n\nexp \uf028 ikz \uf029\ni\uf06c z\n\n\uf028\n\nu0 \uf028 r \uf029 \uf02a\uf02a exp ik r\n\n2\n\n2z\n\n\uf029\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k \uf03d 2\uf070 / \uf06c and \uf02a\uf02a denotes convolution over the transverse coordinates r .

TIE is valid in the limit of small\nobject-to-detector distances. The differential phase shift \uf0d1\uf046 can be solved using the Fourier transform\nmethod based on Eq. (7) [15, 16]. Eq. (6) has been derived by taking advantage of a second-order\napproximation to the phase term, which helps to relax the limitation of weak absorption and slowly\nphase variation, making the differential phase reconstruction more accurate and stable. The phase shift\nof an x-ray beam passing through tissues is described as a projection, and can be used as input to a\nclassic tomographic reconstruction algorithm to create a 3D reconstruction of the refractive index\n\uf064 \uf028 r, z \uf029 in Eq. (2). Although the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm has been shown to be exact\n\nand fast implementation in the tomographic imaging [17], the iterative reconstruction approach also\noffers distinct advantages relative to analytic reconstruction in the cases of noisy and incomplete data.\nEspecially, the recently emerging compressive sensing theory is powerful in solving under-determined\ninverse problems. Compressive sensing allows an accurate and stable image reconstruction using far\nfewer samples or measurement data than what are usually required, which can significantly reduce the\nnumber of projections, resulting in a significant reduction of radiation dose [18].\n3. Numerical experiments\n\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed reconstruction approach, we carried out a series of\nnumerical experiments using Beatle's phase and attenuation images, which come from the European\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble). These images have a variety of features on different\nresolution scale, and consist of 812\u00d7744 pixels per image with a 5\u03bcm resolution. The radiation\nwavelength was set to \u03bb=0.3\u00c5 which corresponds to hard x-rays. Using the Fresnel transform, we\ncalculated the intensity distributions u zi , \uf028 i \uf03d 1, 2, ,3, 4 \uf029 on the image planes at propagation\n\ndistances z1 \uf03d 200, z2 \uf03d 350, z3 \uf03d 500, and z4 \uf03d 650 mm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Poisson noise\nwas added to these intensity images to simulate the experimental condition. The proposed phase\nretrieval algorithm was applied to reconstruct the differential phase shift images. The reconstruction\n\n\fresult is presented in Fig. 2 (b). We also implement a TIE-based reconstruction using the intensity\nimage on object plane and an intensity image at a small propagation distance of 10m to the object.\nThese results show that the proposed reconstruction method has a more high precision and stable than\nTIE method.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\nFig.1.

Conclusion and discussions\n\nIn summary, a novel reconstruction method is proposed for the retrieval of x-ray differential phase\nshift induced by an object. The numerical experiments demonstrated the accuracy and stableness of the\nreconstruction method for x-ray differential phase shift. The reconstruction method has a higher-order\naccuracy comparing to the linearized approximation models to overcome the limitation in the weak\n\n\fabsorption scenario and the restriction of slow phase variation assumed in the conventional phase\nreconstruction techniques. The optimal utilization of the diffraction images at different distance\neliminates the effect of nonlinear terms in phase and attenuation, and simplifies the reconstruction\nprocess to a linear inverse problem, outperforming the conventional iterative scheme of phase\nreconstruction [11] that the convergence remains an open problem. Theoretically, our method can be\nextended to a high-order approximation for the phase term at cost of intensity measurement at more\ndistances. In the grating interferometer techniques, the complicated phase and analyzer absorption\ngratings is employed to extract the differential phase shift, being enslaved to the fabrication of grating\nwith large sizes and high slit aspects. Our reconstruction approach retrieves the differential phase shift\nof an object only using the x-ray intensity measurement, significant simplifying the imaging system\ndesign and cost. It would replace the grating interferometer techniques to develop a new phase imaging\nsystem coupled with single source grating. In addition, the reconstruction formula (8) is also a\ngeneralization of transport of intensity equation (TIE). It has the second order computational accuracy,\nwhile TIE is only computed using a linear approximation, which is less robust to noise due to the lack\nof redundancy, related only two intensity images.\nReferences:\n\n1.\n\nT.
