Jan 2002\n\nEndomorphisms of stable continuous-trace\nC \u2217-algebras\nIlan Hirshberg\nAbstract\nWe classify spectrum-preserving endomorphisms of stable continuoustrace C \u2217 -algebras up to inner automorphism by a surjective multiplicative\ninvariant taking values in finite dimensional vector bundles over the spectrum. Specializing to automorphisms, this gives a different approach to\nresults of Phillips and Raeburn.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 46L05, 46M20\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe structure of automorphisms of continuous-trace C \u2217 -algebras was studied\nby Lance ([L]) and Smith ([S]) (the case of C(X)\u2212automorphisms of C(X) \u2297 K,\nor more precisely C(X) \u2297 B(H)), and subsequently by Phillips and Raeburn\n([PhR], see also [Ro],[RW]) for general continuous trace C \u2217 -algebras.\nThis paper is concerned with the question of generalizing some of those\nresults to the situation of 'unital' endomorphisms of stable continuous-trace\nC \u2217 -algebras. We refer the reader to [RW] and [Di] for general references on the\ntheory of continuous-trace C \u2217 -algebras.\nThroughout the paper, X will denote a locally compact Hausdorff space;\nH will denote a separable Hilbert space and B(H) will denote the bounded\noperators on H; M(A) will denote the multiplier algebra of A; K will denote\nthe algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space; automorphisms,\nendomorphisms and homomorphisms between C \u2217 -algebras and C \u2217 -bundles will\nalways be \u2217-homomorphisms; \u03b4(A) will denote the Dixmier-Douady invariant of\na continuous-trace C \u2217 -algebra A. By a unital homomorphism between two nonunital C \u2217 -algebras we mean a homomorphism which maps approximate units\nto approximate units.\nWe recall that every stable continuous-trace C \u2217 -algebra for which all the\nirreducible representations act on a separable space is isomorphic to the algebra\nof sections of a locally trivial K-bundle over a locally compact Hausdorff space.\nLet E be a locally trivial K-bundle over X, and let A = \u03930 (E). Denote by\nAutX (A) the automorphisms of A which commute with the multiplication action\nof C0 (X) on A, and by Inn(A) the group of inner automorphisms of A, i.e. those\nautomorphisms of A which are given by \u03b1(A) = U AU \u2217 for some U \u2208 M(A).\n1\n\n\fDenote by Homeo\u03b4 (X) the group of homeomorphisms of X which preserve\n\u03b4(A) \u2208 H 3 (X; Z), where cohomology here is taken to mean \u010cech cohomology.\nThe result of Phillips and Raeburn, specialized to this case, can be summarized\nin the following exact sequence.\n(1)\n\n1 \u2192 Inn(A) \u2192 AutX (A) \u2192 H 2 (X; Z) \u2192 1\n\nOf course, some of this structure must be lost when generalizing to endomorphisms. The fact that the endomorphisms do not form a group means that\nspeaking of exact sequences won't make much sense.\nThis paper will be devoted to providing an adequate generalization to sequence (1). Our invariant takes values in vector bundles over X. We will show\nthat the associated vector bundle of a C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1, denoted vect(\u03b1),\nclassifies \u03b1 up to inner automorphism (i.e. vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b1 = AdU \u25e6\u03b2);\nthat all numerable vector bundles over X arise in this way; and that we have a\nproduct formula vect(\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2) (in other words, vect is a semigroup homomorphism from the semigroup of endomorphisms under composition\nto vector bundles under tensor products).\nThe invariant for C0 (X)-automorphisms in this approach will be a complex\nline bundle over X. So if we specialize the above results to automorphisms, then\nwe get a similar sequence to (1) (with the group of complex line bundles over\nX, which is isomorphic to H 2 (X, Z), on the right).\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we study the space of\nendomorphisms of K. In section 3, we discuss the case of C0 (X)-endomorphisms\nof C0 (X)\u2297K. In section 4, we generalize the main results of section 3 to algebras\nwith possibly non-trivial Dixmier-Douady invariant.\n\n2\n\nEndomorphisms of K\n\nLet \u03b1 be an endomorphism of K which is unital, in the sense that it maps\napproximate units to approximate units.\nLet n be the trace of \u03b1(P ) for a minimal projection P \u2208 K, where by trace we\nmean the unique (unbounded) trace on K+ whose value on minimal projections\nis 1. This n clearly is independent of the choice of P , and will be called index(\u03b1).\nThe following simple lemma and its short proof was conveyed to the author\nby W. B. Arveson.\nLemma 2.1. There are isometries S1 , ..., Sn \u2208 M(K) \u223c\n= B(H) with\nn\nX\n\nSi Si\u2217 = 1\n\ni=1\n\nsuch that for all A \u2208 K,\n\u03b1(A) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n2\n\nSi ASi\u2217\n\n\fProof: Letting K act irreducibly on some space H, we observe that \u03b1 gives a\nrepresentation of K on H. This representation decomposes into a direct sum of n\nirreducible representations on pairwise orthogonal subspaces H1 \u2295 ... \u2295 Hn = H,\nand there are isometries Si from H onto Hi , i = 1, ..., n which implement \u03b1|Hi ,\ni.e. Si ASi\u2217 \u03bei = \u03b1(A)\u03bei for \u03bei \u2208 Hi . The lemma follows from this immediately.\n\nNotice that we have Si A = \u03b1(A)Si , i = 1, ..., n. Let\nV\u03b1 = {T \u2208 B(H) | T A = \u03b1(A)T \u2200A \u2208 K}\nV\u03b1 is clearly a vector space. It also has a natural inner product on it. If\nT, S \u2208 V\u03b1 then T \u2217 SA = AT \u2217 S for all A \u2208 K, and therefore T \u2217 S is a scalar\nmultiple of the identity, and indeed hS, T i = T \u2217 S is an inner product.\nLemma 2.2. The Si 's are an orthonormal basis for V\u03b1 .\nPn\nPn\nProof: Let T \u2208 V\u03b1 then T = ( i=1 Si Si\u2217 )T = i=1 hSi , T i Si , as required.\nOrthonormality is immediate.\nPm\nIf T1 , ..., Tm are isometries such that \u03b1(A) = i=1 Ti ATi\u2217 for all A \u2208 K then\nclearly m = index(\u03b1) = n, and the Ti 's form another orthonormal basis for V\u03b1 .\nConversely, if T1 , ..., TnP\nare an orthonormal basis for V\u03b1 then it is straightforward\nn\nto verify that \u03b1(A) = i=1 Ti ATi\u2217 for all A \u2208 K.\nDenote by End(K) the space of unital endomorphisms of K, endowed with\nthe point-norm topology, and by Endn (K) the subset of endomorphisms of\nindex n. Notice that End(K) (and hence all the Endn (K)'s) is metrizable,\nhence paracompact\nP (if A1 , A2 , ... is a dense sequence in the unit sphere of K,\nthen d(\u03b1, \u03b2) = k k\u03b1(Ak ) \u2212 \u03b2(Ak )k/2k is a metric inducing the point-norm\ntopology).\nProposition 2.3. index : End(K) \u2192 N is continuous (so Endn (K) is closed\nand open in End(K) for all n).\nProof: Let \u03b1k \u2192 \u03b1. Let P be a minimal projection, then for sufficiently\nlarge k, we have k\u03b1k (P ) \u2212 \u03b1(P )k < 1. Therefore, \u03b1k (P ) and \u03b1(P ) are Murray\u2013\nvon-Neumann equivalent, and in particular they have the same trace, i.e. index(\u03b1k ) \u2192\nindex(\u03b1). (cf [Pr] Proposition 2.3)\nWe denote by Cn \u2286 B(H)n the space of all n-tuples of isometries satisfying\nthe Cuntz relations, equipped with the strong operator topology. We remark\nthat Cn is metrizable (since the unit sphere of B(H) is metrizable in the SOT),\nhence paracompact. We described above a surjective map \u03c0 : Cn \u2192 Endn (K),\nPn\n(k)\n(k)\ngiven by \u03c0(S1 , ..., Sn )(A) = i=1 Si xSi\u2217 . Suppose (S1 , ..., Sn ) \u2192 (S1 , ..., Sn )\nin Cn , and let A = \u03be \u2297 \u03b7\u0304 \u2208 K a rank 1 operator, then\n(k)\n\n\u03c0(S1 , ..., Sn(k) )(A) =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n3\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\u2217\n\nSi ASi\n\n=\n\n\f=\n\nn\nX\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\u2217\n\nSi \u03be \u2297 Si\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b7\u2192\n\nn\nX\n\nSi\u2217 \u03be \u2297 Si\u2217 \u03b7 = \u03c0(S1 , ..., Sn )(A)\n\ni=1\n\nso \u03c0 is continuous.\nWe define the universal intertwining bundle\nCn\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\nIn\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nEndn (K)\nto be the sub-bundle of Endn (K) \u00d7 B(H) whose fiber over \u03b1 is V\u03b1 (where the\ntopology on B(H) is the strong operator topology).\nUn\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nCn\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c0y\n\nEndn (K)\nis the corresponding principal Un -bundle (the bundle of orthonormal frames).\nLemma 2.4. \u03c0 : Cn \u2192 Endn (K) has local cross sections. In other words, the\nbundles above are locally trivial.\nProof: (cf [RW], Proposition 1.6) We think of K as acting irreducibly on H.\nFix \u03b1 \u2208 Endn (K), and let P = \u03bd \u2297 \u03bd\u0304 \u2208 K be a fixed minimal projection. Let\n\u03c91 , ..., \u03c9n be an orthonormal basis for \u03b1(P )H, and define Si \u2208 B(H), i = 1, .., n\nby Si \u03be = \u03b1(\u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i .\nFor any i, j \u2208 1, ..., n, and \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 H, we have\nhSi \u03be, Sj \u03b7i = h\u03b1(\u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i , \u03b1(\u03b7 \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9j i = h\u03b1(\u03b7 \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u2217 \u03b1(\u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i , \u03c9j i =\n= h\u03b1((\u03b7 \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u2217 \u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i , \u03c9j i = h\u03be, \u03b7i h\u03b1(\u03bd \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i , \u03c9j i = h\u03be, \u03b7i h\u03c9i , \u03c9j i = h\u03be, \u03b7i \u03b4ij\nso S1 , ..., Sn are isometries with orthogonal ranges.\nLet A = \u03be \u2297 \u03b7\u0304, and let \u03b6 \u2208 H, then\nSi A\u03b6 = (Si \u03be \u2297 \u03b7\u0304)\u03b6 = h\u03b6, \u03b7i Si \u03be = h\u03b6, \u03b7i \u03b1(\u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)\u03c9i =\n= \u03b1((\u03be \u2297 \u03b7\u0304)(\u03b6 \u2297 \u03bd\u0304))\u03c9i = \u03b1(A)\u03b1(\u03b6 \u2297 \u03bd\u0304))\u03c9i = \u03b1(A)Si \u03b6\nso Si is an intertwiner.\n4\n\n\fTherefore, \u03c0(S1 , ..., Sn ) = \u03b1. Now, define f1 , ..., fn : Endn (K) \u2192 H by\nfi (\u03b2) = \u03b2(P )\u03c9i\nThe fi are all clearly continuous, and fi (\u03b1) = \u03c9i . Therefore, there is an\nopen neighborhood N of \u03b1 in which f1 , ..., fn are linearly independent. Let\ng1 , ..., gn : N \u2192 H be obtained from f1 , ..., fn via the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, then the gi 's are continuous as well.\nNow, let\ns1 , ..., sn : N \u2192 B(H) be given by\nsi (\u03b2)\u03be = \u03b2(\u03be \u2297 \u03bd\u0304)gi (\u03b2) , \u03be \u2208 H\nthen the si 's are clearly continuous (when B(H) is given the strong operator\ntopology), and from the above, we have (s1 (\u03b2), ..., sn (\u03b2)) \u2208 Cn for all \u03b2, and\n\u03c0(s1 (\u03b2), ..., sn (\u03b2)) = \u03b2, so we have a local cross section, as required.\nTheorem 2.5. Cn is contractible.\nProof: Let vt : L2 (R+ ) \u2192 L2 (R+ ) be the unilateral shifts, pt = 1 \u2212 vt vt\u2217 ,\nsome fixed n-tuple of isometries satisfying the Cuntz relations on a\nseparable Hilbert space H\u2032 . Identify H = H\u2032 \u2297 L2 (R+ ), and let Vt = 1 \u2297 vt ,\nPt = 1 \u2297 pt , Ti = Ti\u2032 \u2297 1, i = 1, .., n. Define a family of maps \u03a6t : Cn \u2192 Cn by\n(T1\u2032 , ..., Tn\u2032 )\n\n\u03a6t (S1 , ..., Sn ) = (..., Vt Si Vt\u2217 + Pt Ti Pt , ...)\nthen it is easy to see \u03a6t is SOT-continuous in t, that \u03a6t (S1 , ..., Sn ) \u2208 Cn for all\n(S1 , ..., Sn ) \u2208 Cn , and that and SOT \u2212 lim \u03a6t (S1 , ..., Sn ) = (T1 , ..., Tn ) for any\n(S1 , ..., Sn ) \u2208 Cn , so \u03a6t gives us a contraction as required.\nRecall that an open cover {U\u03bb } of a topological space Y is said to be numerable if there is a locally finite partition of unity {f\u03bc } such that the open cover\n{f\u03bc\u22121 ((0, 1])} refines {U\u03bb }. Notice that if Y is paracompact then any open cover\nis numerable. A principal Un -bundle \u03b6 over Y is said to be numerable if there\nis a numerable open cover {U\u03bb } of Y such that \u03b6|U\u03bb is trivial for all \u03bb. If Y is\nparacompact then any locally trivial bundle is numerable. The pull back of a\nnumerable bundle is also numerable. A numerable principal Un -bundle over a\nspace B is said to be universal if\n1. Any numerable principal Un -bundle over some space Y is isomorphic to a\npull-back bundle of this bundle via a map Y \u2192 B.\n2. Two maps Y \u2192 B give rise to isomorphic pull-back bundles if and only if\nthey are homotopic.\nA universal Hermitian vector bundle is defined in the analogous way, and a\nHermitian vector bundle is universal if and only if its associated principal Un bundle is universal.\nBy a theorem of Dold ([Do] Theorem 7.5), a numerable principal Un -bundle\nis universal if and only if the total space is contractible.\n5\n\n\fCorollary 2.6. The above bundles are universal.\nRemark 2.7. For any fixed (S1 , ..., Sn ) \u2208 Cn we can define a map U(H) \u2192 Cn\nby U 7\u2192 (U S1 , ...U Sn ). This map can readily be seen to be a homeomorphism,\nso in fact all the Cn 's are homeomorphic.\nRemark 2.8. The focus of this paper is ordinary (=complex) C \u2217 -algebras,\nhowever it is worth noticing that the analogous results of this section along\nwith their proofs hold for endomorphisms of the real C \u2217 -algebra of compact\noperators on a real separable Hilbert space as well (replacing complex bundles\nby real bundles, unitaries by orthogonals and so on).\n\nC0(X)-Endomorphisms of C0(X) \u2297 K\n\n3\n\nWe now turn to study endomorphisms of C0 (X) \u2297 K which commute with the\nmultiplier action of C0 (X). We refer to those as C0 (X)-endomorphisms.\nLemma 3.1. Let \u03c3 : X \u2192 End(K) be a continuous map, then there is a C0 (X)endomorphism \u03b1 of C0 (X) \u2297 K given by \u03b1(f )(x) = \u03c3(x)(f (x)). Furthermore,\nany C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1 of C0 (X) \u2297 K is of this form.\nProof: The proof is straightforward (and virtually identical to Lemma 4.28\nin [RW], using endomorphisms instead of automorphisms), and the details are\nleft to the reader.\nWe henceforth denote this map by x 7\u2192 \u03b1x .\nDefinition 3.2.\nvect(\u03b1) = {(x, T ) | T A = \u03b1x (A)T \u2200A \u2208 K} \u2286 X \u00d7 B(H)\nNotice that vect(\u03b1) is the pull-back of the universal intertwining bundle(s)\nvia the map x \u2192 \u03b1x (where possibly the dimension may be different on different\ncomponents of X; by Proposition 2.3, the dimension will be locally constant).\nIn particular, vect(\u03b1) is numerable.\nCorollary 3.3. For any numerable Hermitian vector bundle v there exists a\nC0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1 such that vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n=\n= v. Furthermore, vect(\u03b1) \u223c\nvect(\u03b2) if and only if \u03b1 is connected to \u03b2 via a path of C0 (X)-endomorphisms.\nTheorem 3.4. Let \u03b1,\u03b2 be C0 (X)-endomorphisms, then\nvect(\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2)\nProof: Define a map\nvect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2) \u2192 vect(\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2)\nby\n(x, T \u2297 S) 7\u2192 (x, T S)\nVerifying that this map is a well defined bundle isomorphism is immediate.\n6\n\n\fThe associated vector bundle to a C0 (X)-endomorphism classifies the C0 (X)endomorphism up to homotopy. A more natural equivalence relation on C0 (X)endomorphisms is classification up to inner automorphism, i.e., \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2 if there is\na unitary U in M(C0 (X)\u2297K) such that Ad U \u25e6\u03b1 = \u03b2. The following proposition\nshows that the two equivalence relations coincide.\nObservation 3.5. Hom(vect(\u03b1), vect(\u03b2)) is isomorphic to the sub-bundle of\nthe X \u00d7 B(H) whose fiber over x is span{T S \u2217 | T \u2208 vect(\u03b2) , S \u2208 vect(\u03b1)}.\nTheorem 3.6. vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2) if and only if \u03b1 = Ad U \u25e6 \u03b2 for some unitary\nU.\nWe give two proofs of this theorem. The first proves the theorem directly,\nusing the preceeding observation. The second proof uses a modified argument\nfrom [Po] (Theorem 2.4) to show that equivalence up to inner automorphism\ncoincides with equivalence up to homotopy.\nProof 1: If \u03b1 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b2 where \u03b3 is an inner automorphism, then by theorem\n3.4 we have vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b3) \u2297 vect(\u03b2). But vect(\u03b3) is the trivial line bundle,\nso vect(\u03b3) \u2297 vect(\u03b2) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2).\nFor the converse, vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2) means that there is an isomorphism\nbetween them, i.e. a unitary element in Hom(vect(\u03b1), vect(\u03b2)), which by observation 3.5 can be viewed as a sub-bundle of X \u00d7 B(H). So we know that there is\na unitary section U of this sub-bundle (and in particular, U \u2208 M(C0 (X) \u2297 K)),\nand any such section can immediately be seen to satisfy U \u03b1(A)U \u2217 = \u03b2(A) for\nall A \u2208 C0 (X) \u2297 K, i.e. \u03b1 = Ad U \u25e6 \u03b2, as required.\nProof 2: Suppose U implements an equivalence between \u03b1 and \u03b2. U can\nbe thought of as a function u : X \u2192 U(H). We know that U(H) is contractible\n(by theorem 2.5 for example, observing that U(H) \u223c\n= C1 ). Therefore, there\nis a path of functions ut : X \u2192 U(H), continuous when viewed as functions\nX \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 U(H), such that u0 = u, u1 \u2261 1. Let Ut be the corresponding path\nof unitaries in M(C0 (X) \u2297 K), then \u03b1t = AdUt \u25e6 \u03b1 implements a homotopy\nbetween \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nConversely, suppose \u03b1 and \u03b2 are homotopic. Let eij (i, j \u2208 N) be matrix units for K, and let Eij = 1 \u2297 eij \u2208 Cb (X) \u2297 K \u2286 M(C0 (X) \u2297 K). So\nthe projections \u03b1(E11 ), \u03b2(E11 ) are homotopic (where by that we mean the\ncanonical extensions of \u03b1, \u03b2 applied to E11 ). Since homotopic projections\nare unitarily equivalent (see, for example, [B] chapter 4), we can find a unitary V such that V \u03b1(E11 )V \u2217 = \u03b2(E11 ), and therefore we can find a partial\n\u2217\n\u2217\nisometry\nP\u221e W \u2208 M(C0 (X) \u2297 K) with W W = \u03b1(E11 ), W W = \u03b2(E11 ). Let\nU = i=1 \u03b2(Ei1 )W \u03b1(E1i ), the sum taken in the strict topology. It is straightforward to verify that U is unitary. Now, the span of the elements of the form\nf \u2297 eij , where f \u2208 C0 (X) is dense in C0 (X) \u2297 K, and\nX\n\u03b2(Ei1 )W \u03b1(E1i )\u03b1(f \u2297 ekl )\u03b1(Ej1 )W \u2217 \u03b2(E1j ) =\nU \u03b1(f \u2297 ekl )U \u2217 =\ni,j\n\n= \u03b2(Ek1 )W \u03b1(f \u2297 e11 )W \u2217 \u03b2(E1l ) = \u03b2(Ek1 )W f * \u03b1(E11 )W \u2217 \u03b2(E1l ) =\n7\n\n\f= f * \u03b2(Ek1 )W W \u2217 W W \u2217 \u03b2(E1l ) = f * \u03b2(Ek1 )\u03b2(E11 )\u03b2(E1l ) =\n= f * \u03b2(Ekl ) = \u03b2(f \u2297 ekl )\n\nRemark 3.7. Notice that \u03b1 is an automorphism if and only if vect(\u03b1) is a line\nbundle. So, if we restrict our attention to automorphisms, we get a map from the\ngroup of spectrum preserving automorphisms onto the group of Hermitian line\nbundles, whose kernel is the inner automorphisms. The group of line bundles is\nisomorphic to H 2 (X; Z) (at least in the case in which X is paracompact; see for\nexample [K], I.3). So, we recover the exact sequence of Phillips and Raeburn\nmentioned in the introduction.\nComposition of C0 (X)-endomorphisms maps under vect to tensor products.\nOne might ask if there is a natural operation on C0 (X)-endomorphisms which is\ntaken to the direct (Whitney) sum. We can indeed construct such an operation,\nas follows. Let s1 , s2 \u2208 M(C0 (X)\u2297K) be two isometries such that s1 s\u22171 +s2 s\u22172 =\n1, and let \u03b1,\u03b2 be C0 (X)-endomorphisms of C0 (X) \u2297 K, then we can define\n\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2 by\n(\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2)(A) = s1 \u03b1(A)s\u22171 + s2 \u03b2(A)s\u22172\nWhile the definition depends, of course, on the choice of s1 , s2 , this direct sum\nconstruction is unique up to homotopy, and hence by theorem 3.6, up to equivalence via an inner automorphism. The uniqueness up to homotopy follows\neasily from the fact that each pair (s1 , s2 ) corresponds in the obvious way to a\nmap X \u2192 C2 , and any two such maps are homotopic, since C2 is contractible\n(theorem 2.5).\nDefine a map\n\u03a8 : vect(\u03b1) \u2295 vect(\u03b2) \u2192 vect(\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2)\nby\n\u03a8(x, T1 \u2295 T2 ) = (x, s1 (x)T1 + s2 (x)T2 )\nwhere s1 (x),s2 (x) are the two isometries obtain by evaluating the map X \u2192 C2\nat x. To verify that this is a bundle map, we first have to see that \u03a8(x, T1 \u2295T2 ) \u2208\nvect(\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2). Let us denote the maps X \u2192 End(K) corresponding to \u03b1,\u03b2\nby x 7\u2192 \u03b1x ,\u03b2x , respectively, and fix x \u2208 X, then for any A \u2208 K,\n\u03a8(T1 \u2295 T2 )A = s1 (x)T1 A + s2 (x)T2 A = s1 (x)\u03b1x (A)T1 + s2 (x)\u03b2x (A)T2 =\n= (\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2)x (A)(s1 (x)T1 + s2 (x)T2 ) = (\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2)x (A)\u03a8(T1 \u2295 T2 )\nso indeed \u03a8(x, T1 \u2295 T2 ) \u2208 vect(\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2). \u03a8 is clearly a bundle map, so now it\nremains to show that it is an isomorphism. Since s1 (x),s2 (x) are isometries, \u03a8 is\ninjective. For surjectivity, let (x, T ) \u2208 vect(\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2). Let T1 = s1 (x)\u2217 T ,T2 =\ns2 (x)\u2217 T then for any A \u2208 K, we have\nT1 A = s1 (x)\u2217 T A = s1 (x)\u2217 (\u03b1 \u2295(s1 ,s2 ) \u03b2)x (A)T =\n8\n\n\f= s1 (x)\u2217 (s1 (x)\u03b1x (A)s\u22171 + s2 (x)\u03b2x (A)s\u22172 )T = \u03b1x (A)s\u22171 T = \u03b1x (A)T1\nand similarly we have T2 A = \u03b2x (A)T2 , so (x, T1 \u2295 T2 ) \u2208 vect(\u03b1) \u2295 vect(\u03b2) and\n\u03a8(x, T1 \u2295 T2 ) = (x, T ), so \u03a8 is surjective.\nWe conclude the section with a summary of the main results.\nConclusion: To each C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1 of C0 (X) \u2297 K we associate the\nbundle vect(\u03b1) of intertwining operators.\n1. vect(\u03b1) is numerable, and any numerable vector bundle arises as vect(\u03b1)\nfor some C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1.\n2. vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2) if and only if \u03b1 = AdU \u25e6\u03b2 for some U \u2208 M(C0 (X)\u2297K).\n3. vect(\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2) = vect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2)\n4. vect(\u03b1) is a trivial bundle if and only if the endomorphism is inner, in\nthe sensePthat there exist isometries S1 , ..., Sn \u2208 M(C0 (X) \u2297 K) such that\n\u03b1(A) =\nSi ASi\u2217 .\nRemark 3.8. As in the previous section, we remark that the analogous results\nfor real C \u2217 -algebras can be obtained in a straightforward way, by going through\nthe proofs, replacing the complex terminology by the real terminology.\n\n4\n\nC0 (X)-Endomorphisms of Stable ContinuousTrace C \u2217-algebras\n\nLet E be a numerable fiber bundle over X with fiber K and structure group\nAut(K), and let \u03930 (E) be the C \u2217 -algebra of sections. The purpose of this section\nis to generalize the main results of the previous section to this case.\nNote that M(\u03930 (E))) can be identified with the sections of a bundle with\nfiber B(H) and the same Dixmier-Douady class (see [PhR], Proposition 2.15\nand the following remark). We refer to this bundle henceforth as the multiplier\nbundle of E. Denote by Bx the fiber of the multiplier bundle over a point x \u2208 X.\nFor a C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b1, we denote by \u03b1x the action of \u03b1 on the fiber over\nx (coming from the induced action of \u03b1 on the quotient algebra corresponding\nto the primitive ideal represented by x), and then as before, we can define\nvect(\u03b1) = {(x, T ) | T \u2208 Bx , T A = \u03b1x (A)T \u2200A \u2208 Ex }\nSince E is locally trivial, we see that the restriction of vect(\u03b1) to each trivialization of E is locally trivial, and hence it is also locally trivial.\nvect(\u03b1) determines \u03b1 as above: if N \u2286 X is such that vect(\u03b1)|N ,E|N are\ntrivial, then choose\nP orthonormal sections S1 , ..., Sn of the restricted bundle, and\nthen \u03b1|N (A) = Si ASi\u2217 for A \u2208 \u0393(E|N ); those restrictions determine \u03b1.\n9\n\n\fIf there is a unitary U \u2208 M(\u03930 (E)) such that \u03b1(A) = U \u2217 \u03b2(A)U for all\nA \u2208 \u03930 (E) then T Ax = \u03b1x (Ax )T if and only if (Ux T )Ax = \u03b2x (Ax )(Ux T ), so\nleft multiplication by U gives a vector bundle isomorphism vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2).\nConversely, suppose vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b2). Note that as before, Hom(vect(\u03b1), vect(\u03b2))\nis isomorphic to the sub-bundle of the multiplier bundle whose fiber over x is\nspan{T S \u2217 | T \u2208 vect(\u03b2) , S \u2208 vect(\u03b1)}. Since there exists a unitary element\nin Hom(vect(\u03b1), vect(\u03b2)), we know that there is a unitary section U of the\nabove sub-bundle (and in particular, U \u2208 M(\u03930 (E))), and any such U satisfies\nU \u03b1(A)U \u2217 = \u03b2(A) for all A \u2208 \u03930 (E).\nSo, as in the case of C0 (X)-endomorphisms of C0 (X) \u2297 K, we constructed\na map vect from C0 (X)-endomorphisms to vector bundles such that vect(\u03b1) \u223c\n=\nvect(\u03b2) if and only if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are equivalent via an inner automorphism. The\nproduct formula from theorem 3.4 extends as well to this situation, with essentially the same proof.\nIf E1 ,E2 are two locally trivial K-bundles over X, then E1 \u2297 E2 is a locally\ntrivial K-bundle over X, and if \u03b11 ,\u03b12 are C0 (X)-endomorphisms of \u0393(E1 ),\u0393(E2 )\nrespectively then we can have a C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b11 \u2297 \u03b12 of \u0393(E1 \u2297 E2 ).\nLemma 4.1. Let E1 ,E2 be two locally trivial K-bundles over X, and let \u03b11 ,\u03b12\nbe C0 (X)-endomorphisms of \u0393(E1 ),\u0393(E2 ), respectively.\n1. vect(\u03b1 \u2297X \u03b2) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2)\n2. If \u03c6 : \u0393(E1 ) \u2192 \u0393(E2 ) is an isomorphism commuting with the multiplier\naction of C0 (X) then vect(\u03c6\u03b1\u03c6\u22121 ) \u223c\n= vect(\u03b1)\n(cf [RW] lemma 6.6)\nProof: Let M1 ,M2 denote the multiplier bundles of E1 ,E2 respectively. We\ndenote by M1 \u2297 M2 the fiber-wise tensor product bundle, where the tensor\nproduct is taken to be the spatial tensor product, and observe that M1 \u2297 M2\nis canonically the multiplier bundle of E1 \u2297 E2 . vect(\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2) is a sub-bundle of\nM1 \u2297 M2 , as is vect(\u03b1) \u2297 vect(\u03b2), and it is immediate to verify that they are\nin fact the same. That proves (1). (2) follows immediately from the product\nformula (the extension of theorem 3.4).\nWe can now obtain surjectivity of vect as follows (cf [RW], p. 160). Suppose v is a given numerable vector bundle. Let E be our given K-bundle, and\nlet E0 be the trivial bundle. By the results of the previous section, there exists a C0 (X)-endomorphism \u03b10 of \u0393(E0 ) \u223c\n= C0 (X) \u2297 K with vect(\u03b10 ) \u223c\n= v.\nNote that vect(id\u03930 (E) ) is the trivial line bundle \u01eb0 over X. Define a C0 (X)endomorphism \u03b1 of \u03930 (E) by \u03b1 = \u03b10 \u2297 id\u03930 (E) , then\nvect(\u03b1) \u223c\n=v\n= v \u2297 \u01eb0 \u223c\n= vect(\u03b10 ) \u2297 vect(id\u03930 (E) ) \u223c\nIf \u03b1 is a given endomorphism \u03930 (E), let E op be the opposite bundle, and let\n\u03b10 = \u03b1 \u2297 idE op , then \u03b10 is an endomorphism of E0 \u223c\n= E \u2297 E op , and as above,\n\u223c\nvect(\u03b1) = vect(\u03b10 ), and we know that vect(\u03b10 ) is numerable, hence vect(\u03b1) is\nnumerable as well.\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[B]\n\nBlackadar, B., K-Theory for Operator Algebras, 2nd edition, MSRI publications 5, Cambridge University Press, 1998.\n\n[Di]\n\nDixmier, J., C \u2217 -algebras, North Holland, 1977.\n\n[Do]\n\nDold, A., Partitions of unity in the theory of fibrations, Ann.
