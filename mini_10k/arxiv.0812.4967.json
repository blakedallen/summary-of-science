It continues\nto attract much attention among experimental and theoretical physicists. Its large-scale physics is governed by\nthe requirement of anomaly cancellation at the boundary\nof the system. It provides an example of the so called\n\"holographic principle\",3,4 which means that the physics\nof the system confined to some region is encoded in the\nphysics of the degrees of freedom at the boundary of this\nregion (see Fig. 1). Understanding the physics of the\nquantum Hall (QH) edge states is therefore important\nfor an understanding of the QHE in general.\nIn the theoretical description of incompressible quantum Hall fluids, the \"holographic principle\" manifests\nitself in the presence of chiral edge channels in the\nlow-energy effective theory.1 These boundary channels\nare thought to be described by chiral conformal field\ntheory.6,7 The possible structure of this description is\nhighly constrained by the requirements of locality, the\ngauge invariance (charge conservation), and the presence\nof excitations describing electrons (i.e., with quantum\nnumbers of an electron or hole) in the spectrum. These\nrequirements allow one to classify possible effective lowenergy models for all observed filling factors.8,9 However,\nwithout taking into account microscopic properties of\na particular incompressible QH state, the requirements\nmentioned above usually do not determine the low-energy\neffective theory uniquely. Already in examples of incompressible Hall fluids corresponding to simple fractions,\nsuch as \u03bd = 2/3, 2/5, etc., there are several physically\ninequivalent models satisfying all the requirements even\nif one limits one's attention to models with the smallest\n\npossible number of edge channels. This situation calls for\nexperimental tests of the theory.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Illustration of the holography in a QH\nsystem. The Hall current in the bulk (blue arrows) has an\nanomaly at the edge (i.e., it is not conserved). This anomaly\nmust be canceled by the anomaly of the edge current (red\narrows).5 Therefore, there is an anomalous boundary action\n\u0393[a] that is constrained by the requirement of anomaly cancellation in the bulk effective action S[A].\n\nThere are several proposals to test the QH edge\nphysics. Concrete attempts for such tests have been\nmade in three directions: measurement of the electric\ncharge, of the statistical phase, and of the scaling dimension of excitations (quasi-particles and electrons). The\nscaling dimension of the electron field operator may be\ntested via the I-V curve at a tunnel junction.10 This idea\nhas been experimentally implemented in Refs. [11,12].\nThe results of these experiments caused an extensive discussion of the well known \"2.7 problem\".13 The interpretation of the experiments described in Refs. [11,12] is\nnot straightforward, and one may need to take into account the existence of compressible strips14 at the edge,\nof disorder,15 and of electron-phonon interactions.16 The\ncharge of quasi-particles may be probed by measur-\n\n\f2\ning the Fano factor of the tunneling current.17 Currently, fractional charges have been observed in several\nexperiments18,19 at different filling factors. Several proposals have been made to use the Fabry-Perot20 (FP)\nand the Mach-Zehnder21 (MZ) electronic interferometers,\nwhich utilize QH edge channels, in place of optical beams,\nfor measurements of fractional charge and of anyon statistics of quasi-particles.22\u221226\nIn this work we propose an experiment that would\nallow one to find out which effective model describes\na particular filling factor. The idea is to use an MZ\ninterferometer in order to measure simultaneously the\ncharge and the scaling dimension for each species of\nquasi-particles that may tunnel through a quantum point\ncontact (QPC). Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in an\nMZ interferometer have recently been investigated experimentally in Refs. [27-30] and showed surprising behavior. This has been addressed in several theoretical\nworks.31,32,33,34,35 The main result of the present work,\nEqs. (68) and (70) describing the AB-oscillating contribution to the current through an MZ interferometer at\nlow and high temperatures, shows that the Fourier spectrum of the current as a function of the flux can be used\nto extract the scaling dimensions and charges of quasiparticles. As an example, we consider the well observed\nfilling factor \u03bd = 2/3 in some detail. We present possible effective models for this filling factor and discuss how\nthey can be distinguished from each other with the help\nof their spectra of scaling dimensions.\nAn important property of the \u03bd = 2/3 state is that all\nminimal models of its edge degrees of freedom contain\ntwo edge channels. A similar situation is encountered\nat \u03bd = 2, where it has been shown that the long-range\nCoulomb interaction between the channels leads to some\nuniversalities.35 In this paper we show that Coulomb interactions fix a freedom in the choice of the edge Hamiltonian, so that scaling dimensions are fully determined\nby the matrix (30) of statistical phases of electrons (see\nSec. V).\nWe start our paper by recalling the effective theory\nof QH edges and the classification of possible models.\nIn Sec. II we formulate general requirements that any\nmodel must satisfy. We illustrate the implementation\nof these requirements with the example of fluids with\n\u03bd = 1/(2k + 1), where a simple hydrodynamic approach\ncan be used, and discuss limitations of this approach.\nIn Sec. III, we discuss general multi-channel edge models and recall the construction of local excitations and of\ntheir correlation functions. In Sec. IV we explicitly determine the spectrum of scaling dimensions for the most\nplausible (minimal) models corresponding to \u03bd = 2/3.\nSection V is devoted to an analysis of the role of Coulomb\ninteractions. Finally, in Sec. VI, we investigate transport\ntrough an electronic MZ interferometer and show how\nscaling dimensions of excitations can be extracted from\nAB oscillations of the current through the interferometer.\nOur form of the tunneling Hamiltonian, which is an important ingredient of the theory, is thoroughly discussed\n\nin Appendix C.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE THEORY OF QH EDGES\n\nThe effective theory presented in this section provides\na description of the low-energy physics of a QH edge.\nWhile the correct model of edge states may depend on microscopic details of a two dimensional electron gas, there\nare general physical requirements that greatly reduce the\nnumber of relevant models.6,7 These requirements are as\nfollow:\n\u2022 Cancellation of anomaly. It is well known that the\nChern-Simons theory of an incompressible quantum Hall state is anomalous, i.e., in the presence of\na boundary, its gauge variation is given by a nonvanishing boundary term. The effective model of\nedge states has to be chosen in such a way as to\ncancel the anomaly of the bulk action in order for\nthe complete theory to be gauge invariant.\n\u2022 Existence of an electron operator.\nA twodimensional electron gas consists of electrons.\nThus, on a microscopic level, the quantum Hall\nstate is described by an electron wave function.\nThis implies that, in the effective edge theory, there\nshould exist at least one local operator describing\nthe creation or annihilation of an electron or hole,\ni.e., with a charge e and Fermi statistics.\n\u2022 Single-valuedness in the electron positions. Similarly, because the QH state describes electrons, its\nwave function must be single-valued in the electron\npositions, irrespective of whether quasi-particles\nare present. As a consequence, in the effective theory the mutual statistical phase of a quasi-particle\nand an electron must be an integer multiple of \u03c0.36\nBelow we use these requirements to construct the most\nsimple effective models of QH edge states and to classify\nvarious multi-field models in Sec. III.\n\nA.\n\nChern-Simons theory and gauge anomaly\n\nFirst of all, in an incompressible quantum Hall fluid\nthe electric current density, j, in the bulk of the system8\nis related to the electromagnetic potential A by Hall's\nlaw\nj \u03bc = \u03c3H \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the constant \u03c3H = \u03bd/2\u03c0 is the Hall conductivity and the rational number \u03bd is the filling factor; (here\nand below, we use units where e = ~ = 1, and the Einstein summation convention is followed, unless specified\notherwise). The effective action that leads to Hall's law\n\n\f3\n(1) via j \u03bc = \u03b4Scs /\u03b4A\u03bc is the three-dimensional ChernSimons action\nZ\n\u03c3H\nd3 r \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03bc \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb ,\n(2)\nScs =\n2 D\nwhere D is the product of the time axis and some spatial\ndomain.\nAction (2) is anomalous, i.e., it has a nonvanishing\ngauge variation in the presence of a boundary. Indeed,\ngauge transforming the potential A\u03bb \u2192 A\u03bb + \u2202\u03bb f in Eq.\n(2) by an arbitrary gauge function f (r) and integrating\nby parts, we obtain the variation of the action:\nZ\n\u03c3H\n\u03b4Scs =\nd2 r \u01eb\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb f.\n(3)\n2 \u2202D\nThis anomaly originates from the fact that the current (1)\nis not conserved at the boundary: \u2202\u03bc j \u03bc 6= 0, for r \u2208 \u2202D.\nIndeed, taking the derivative of Eq. (1), we find that\n\u2202\u03bc j \u03bc = \u03c3H \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb \u2202\u03bc \u03b8D ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the function \u03b8D takes values \u03b8D = 1 and \u03b8D = 0\ninside and outside the domain D, respectively.\nThe anomaly must be compensated by boundary degrees of freedom coupled to the electromagnetic field.\nNamely, the total effective action, after the boundary\nfields are integrated out, is given by a sum of two terms,\nStot [A] = Scs [A] + \u0393[a],\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a is the electromagnetic field at the boundary,\na = A|\u2202D , and \u0393[a] is an anomalous action at the edge.37\nThe anomaly in \u0393 must be such that, under a gauge\ntransformation a\u03bb \u2192 a\u03bb +\u2202\u03bb f , this action acquires a variation that cancels exactly the one of the bulk action, see\n(3): \u03b4\u0393 = \u2212\u03b4Scs . Under this condition, Stot [A] is gaugeinvariant. Consequently, the edge current J, defined as\nJ \u03bc = \u03b4(Scs +\u0393)/\u03b4a\u03bc , is anomalous, with divergence given\nby\n\u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = \u03c3H \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc a\u03bd\n\n(6)\n\nThis divergence cancels the divergence (4) of the bulk\ncurrent. Below we discuss various models that incorporate these general ideas, starting from a simple hydrodynamical model.\nB.\n\nHydrodynamics of incompressible edge\ndeformations\n\nNext, we recall some arguments in Ref. [38], with some\nmodifications taking into account the physics related to\nlong-range Coulomb interactions. Edge excitations can\nbe viewed as deformations of the boundary of an incompressible QH liquid caused by the bulk current flowing\ntowards the edge (see Fig. 2). We parametrize these\ndeformations by a function y = h(x, t) and consider a\n\nlow-energy limit, so that h \u226a lh , where lh is the characteristic wave length of the deformations. Introducing\nan auxiliary boundary at a distance y0 from the edge,\nwith lh \u226b y0 \u226b h, we represent the edge current J \u2261 Jx\nRh\nas the integral J = \u2212y0 dyjx , and, for the accumulated\ncharge density at the edge, \u03c1 \u2261 Jt , we write \u03c1 = n0 h,\nwhere n0 = \u03bdB/2\u03c0c is the density of the QH liquid and\nB is the magnetic field value.\n\nFIG. 2: Deformations of the boundary (thick line) of an incompressible QH fluid (shown in gray) are parameterized by\nthe function y = h(x, t). The auxiliary boundary, where\nbulk and edge currents match, is indicated by the dashed\nline y = \u2212y0 .\n\nAn unpleasant aspect of this approach is that the\nedge current explicitly depends on the auxiliary cutoff\nat y = \u2212y0 . However, we show that the resulting equation of motion for the edge deformations, h(x, t), does\nnot contain this cutoff, and hence the edge current can\nbe redefined to depend on h only. Indeed, charge conservation implies that \u2202t \u03c1 + \u2202x J = jy , where the bulk\ncurrent density jy is taken at the boundary y = \u2212y0 .\nUsing Eq. (1) and fixing the gauge ax = 0, we write\nJ = \u03c3H [\u03c6(x, h) \u2212 \u03c6(x, \u2212y0 )], where \u03c6(x, y) is the total electrostatic potential in the plane of the QH fluid.\nSubstituting this expression for the current in the continuity equation, we observe that the terms containing\ny0 cancel, and the equation of motion takes the form\n\u2202t \u03c1 + \u03c3H \u2202x \u03c6 = 0. Finally, we split the potential \u03c6 into\ntwo parts and write \u2202x \u03c6 = \u2202x \u03c6h \u2212 \u1ebcx , where \u03c6h is the\npotential at the edge caused by its deformation, and \u1ebcx\nis the external electric field evaluated at y = h. While \u1ebcx\ndepends on h in general, in the low-energy limit it can\nbe taken at y = 0, to leading order in h. The equation of\nmotion then reads,\n\u2202t \u03c1 + \u03c3H \u2202x \u03c6h = \u03c3H \u1ebcx .\n\n(7)\n\nAfter a redefinition of the edge current, J = \u03c3H \u03c6h , the\ncutoff parameter y0 is gone.\nIn order to close the equation of motion, we need a\nrelation between the deformation h and the potential\n\u03c6h . In the long wave-length limit, we can simply write\n\u03c6h = \u2212\u2202\u03c1 H = \u2212(1/n0 )\u2202h H, where H is the density of\nelectrostatic energy at the edge. This leads to an equation that is, in general, non-linear in the field \u03c1. Passing\nto a low-energy limit, this equation can be linearized, and\nwe arrive at the result:\n\u2202t \u03c1 \u2212 v\u2202x \u03c1 = \u03c3H \u1ebcx ,\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\nwhere v = (\u03c3H /n20 )\u2202h2 H(0) is the group velocity of the\nedge excitations. For a stable QH liquid, \u2202h2 H(0) is positive, and this equation describes the propagation of chiral\nexcitations.\nThere are two contributions to the electrostatic energy:\none is due to the confining potential at the edge and the\nsecond one is due to Coulomb interactions. Consequently,\nthe group velocity of edge excitations can be written as\na sum of two terms,\nv = cE/B + \u03c3H V,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the first term is the velocity of drift in the electric\nfield E at the edge of the QH liquid, and\nR the second term\nis proportional to the integral V = dx\u2032 UC (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) of\nthe Coulomb interaction potential UC at the edge. This\nintegral is logarithmically divergent and has to be cut\noff at the distance, d, to the metallic gate and at the\nmicroscopic width of the edge a, so that V \u223c ln(d/a).\nHere an important remark is in order. The first term\nin Eq. (9) may be interpreted as a bare velocity, v0 , of\nexcitations. Restoring physical units, it can be estimated\n2\nas v0 \u223c (eE/~)lB\n, where lB is the magnetic length. The\nratio \u03b1 := \u03c3H /v0 \u223c e2 /~v0 plays the role of a dimensionless interaction constant. Depending on the confinement\nat the edge, it is always larger than 1, and, in a typical\nexperiment,21,27,28,29,30 \u03b1 \u2265 10, which may justify the\nhydrodynamical model considered here. Moreover, the\nlong-range character of the Coulomb interaction and the\nfact that d \u226b a leads to a large parameter V . As a result, the hydrodynamical charged mode is always present\nin the spectrum and determines the scaling dimension in\nnon-chiral models, as we demonstrate in Sec. V.\n\nC.\n\nQuantization of edge excitations\n\nIn order to quantize edge excitations, we consider the\ntotal electrostatic energy density H(\u03c1) = (v/2\u03c3H )\u03c12 as a\nHamiltonian that generates the homogeneous version of\nthe equation of motion (8), see Ref. [38]. This equation is\ndiagonal in Fourier space, \u2202t \u03c1k \u2212ivk\u03c1k = 0. We therefore\nwrite the Hamiltonian as\nHk =\n\nv\n\u03c1k \u03c1\u2212k ,\n\u03c3H\n\n(10)\n\n\u221a\n\u03bd\n\u2202x \u03c6(x),\n2\u03c0\n\n[\u03c6(x\u2032 ), \u03c6(x)] = i\u03c0 sgn(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nHere, and in the following, we use the term \"filling fraction\", \u03bd, and \"Hall conductivity\", \u03c3H , synonymously;\nbut we always mean the latter. Then the electron operator takes the form\n\u03c8 = eiq\u03c6\n\n(13)\n\nof a local vertex operator; see, e.g., Ref. [39]. For this\noperator to describe the creation and annihilation of an\nelectron or hole, we require that\n[Qem , eiq\u03c6 ] = eiq\u03c6 ,\n(14)\nR\nR\n\u221a\nwhere Qem = dx\u03c1 = ( \u03bd/2\u03c0) dx\u2202x \u03c6 is the total electric charge at the edge. This requirement implies that\nthe charge of an electron is equal to \u22121. Using the commutation relations (12) we find that\n\u221a\nq = 1/ \u03bd.\n(15)\nIn addition, an electron operator (13) must obey\nfermionic commutation relations.\nApplying the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, we find that\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\neiq\u03c6(x) eiq\u03c6(x ) = ei\u03c0q eiq\u03c6(x ) eiq\u03c6(x) . Using Eq. (15) and\nimposing Fermi statistics, we conclude that\nei\u03c0/\u03bd = \u22121.\n\n(16)\n\nThis implies that the filling factor is given by \u03bd = 1/m,\nwhere m is an odd integer number. In the Sec. III, we\nshow that this limitation can be overcome by constructing a multi-channel edge model.\nAccording to the third principle formulated at the beginning of this section, the theory may describe quasiparticles with the vertex operators eip\u03c6 that must be local\nrelative to the electron operator eiq\u03c6 . Thus the statistical\nphase, \u03b8, of such quasi-particles with respect to an electron has to be an integer multiple of \u03c0. Using again the\ncommutation relation (12), we arrive at the result that\n\u03b8 = \u03c0p * q = \u03c0n,\nand the quasi-particle operator takes the form:\n\u221a\n\n\u03c8n = ein\n\nwhere k > 0. We identify the \"momentum\" with Pk = \u03c1k\nand the \"coordinate\" with Xk = i\u03c1\u2212k /\u03c3H k, so that the\nequations of motion take the form \u2202t Xk = \u2202Hk /\u2202Pk and\n\u2202t Pk = \u2212\u2202Hk /\u2202Xk . Then the canonical commutator\n[Xk , Pk\u2032 ] = i\u03b4kk\u2032 leads to the commutator [\u03c1(x), \u03c1(x\u2032 )] =\ni\u03c3H \u2202x \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) in real space.\nNext, we construct an electron operator. For this purpose it is convenient to represent the charge density in\nterms of a field \u03c6(x),\n\u03c1(x) =\n\nwith commutation relations\n\n\u03bd\u03c6(x)\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere n is an integer. Such operators describe Laughlin quasi-particles.40 The correlation functions of quasiparticle operators may be calculated easily, with the re2\nsult h0|\u03c8n\u2020 (x, t)\u03c8n (0, 0)|0i = (x + vt)\u2212\u03bdn , where |0i denotes the ground state of a quantum Hall fluid with filling\nfraction \u03bd. Taking into account that \u03bd = 1/m, the properties of the operators (17) are as follows: they carry\na charge q(n) = n/m and have the scaling dimensions\n\u2206(n) = n2 /m. Thus, for an elementary quasi-particle\nwith charge 1/m, we have that \u2206min = 1/m, and, for an\nelectron, \u2206el = m.\n\n\f5\nD.\n\nGauge-invariant formulation\n\nIn this section we reformulate the theory of edge excitations presented above in a gauge-invariant form suitable for a generalization to multi-channel fluids conRsidered\nP in Sec. III. We first rewrite the action S =\ndt k>0 [Pk \u2202t Xk \u2212 Hk ] in the linear approximation as\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS[\u03c6] =\ndtdx[\u2202t \u03c6\u2202x \u03c6 \u2212 v(\u2202x \u03c6)2 + 2 \u03bd\u03c6\u1ebcx ], (18)\n4\u03c0\nwhere we have included a term describing the coupling\nto an electric field \u1ebcx . This action can easily be generalized to nonlinear edge modes by replacing the term\n(v/4\u03c0)(\u2202x \u03c6)2 with the full Hamiltonian H(\u03c1).\nNext, we replace derivatives \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 in action (18) with\ntheir gauge-invariant form\n\u221a\nD\u03bc \u03c6 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + \u03bda\u03bc ,\n(19)\nand integrate the last term by parts using the relation\n\u1ebcx = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bb \u2202\u03bc a\u03bb . We then arrive at the following action\n1\nS[\u03c6] =\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\ndtdx[Dt \u03c6Dx \u03c6 \u2212 v(Dx \u03c6)2 ]\n\u221a Z\n\u03bd\ndtdx\u01eb\u03bc\u03bb a\u03bc \u2202\u03bb \u03c6.\n+\n4\u03c0\n\n(20)\n\nIt is easy to check that by fixing the gauge ax = 0, one\nreturns to action (18).\nThe first term in action (20) is invariant under\u221a the\ngauge transformation a\u03bc \u2192 a\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc f , \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bdf .\nThe second\nR term yields the gauge variation \u03b4S[\u03c6] =\n\u2212(\u03bd/4\u03c0) dtdx\u01eb\u03bc\u03bb \u2202\u03bc a\u03bb f , i.e., the edge action has the desired anomaly: It exactly cancels the anomaly (3) of the\nbulk action. Thus, the effective theory described by the\ntotal action Stot = Scs [A] + S[\u03c6] is gauge-invariant. The\nboundary effective action \u0393[a] in Eq. (5) is obtained by\nintegrating out the field \u03c6.\nOne may then check that the gauge-invariant edge current has the correct anomalous divergence (6). To see\nthis, we take a variational derivative of the total action\nwith respect to the boundary potential a. This yields the\nfollowing expression for the edge current:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nJt =\nDx \u03c6, Jx = \u2212\nvDx \u03c6.\n(21)\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nIn a gauge where ax = 0, this expression reproduces definition (11) of the charge density as well as the definition\nof electron operator (13). Indeed, expression (21) for the\nedge current follows from point-splitting of the operator\n\u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8 in the presence of an electromagnetic field. Note\nthat the current satisfies the relation Jx = \u2212vJt , which\nexhibits its chiral nature. Finally, by varying action (20)\nwith respect to \u03c6, we obtain the equation of motion for\n\u03c6, which is used to evaluate the divergence of the current\n(21). We then arrive at Eq. (6), i.e., the edge current has\nthe desired anomalous divergence.\n\nWe conclude that the hydrodynamical model, when\napplied to QH states with \u03bd = 1/m where m is an odd\ninteger, satisfies all the requirements formulated at the\nbeginning of this section. In Sec. III, we show that by\nconsidering more than one bosonic mode at the edge of\na QH liquid, one can construct effective edge models for\ngeneral filling factors.\nIII.\n\nMULTI-CHANNEL EDGE MODELS\n\nAs shown in Sec. II C, a single-channel hydrodynamical\nmodel of the QH edge cannot describe all observed filling fractions. We therefore consider more general multichannel edge models. A natural generalization of singlefield action (20) to many fields is given by\nZ\n1 X\nS[\u03c6i ] =\ndtdx[\u03c3i Dt \u03c6i Dx \u03c6i \u2212 vi (Dx \u03c6i )2 ]\n4\u03c0 i\nZ\n1 X\n+\ndtdx[Qi \u01eb\u03bc\u03bb a\u03bc \u2202\u03bb \u03c6i ], (22)\n4\u03c0 i\nwhere \u03c3i = \u00b11 encodes the chirality of the ith channel,\nvi is the propagation speed, and Qi is the constant of\nelectromagnetic coupling of the field \u03c6i . The covariant\nderivatives are defined by D\u03bc \u03c6i = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6i + \u03c3i Qi a\u03bc . We\nemphasize that any quadratic gauge-invariant action for\nchiral bosons can be brought to the unique form (22) by\nredefining the fields. Here we consider the general case\nwith different propagation speeds, vi , for different edge\nmodes, because recent experiments27,28,29,30 show that\nthis can occur.\nThe requirement of anomaly cancellation for edge action (22) implies that\nX\n\u03c3i Q2i = \u03bd.\n(23)\ni\n\nOne can see that, in contrast to a single-channel edge\nwhere the last term in action (20) is uniquely fixed by\nthe Hall conductivity, in the multi-channel situation\nonly\n\u221a\nthe \"length\" of the vector Qi is fixed to be \u03bd, while, at\nthis point, its direction is still arbitrary.\nA.\n\nKinematics of edge models\n\nIn order to check the second physical requirement, the\nexistence of excitations with the quantum numbers of\nelectron, we consider a general vertex operator\n\u0011\n\u0010 X\nqj \u03c6j ,\n(24)\n\u03c8 = exp i\nj\n\nwhere qj are some constants. Taking into account commutation relations\n[\u2202x \u03c6i (x, t), \u03c6j (x\u2032 , t)] = \u22122\u03c0i\u03c3i \u03b4ij \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(25)\n\n\f6\nwhich follow from Eq. (22), we find that the statistical\nphase of operator (24) is given by:\nX\n\u03c3i qi qi .\n(26)\n\u03b8=\u03c0\n\nwhich follows from the requirement of anomaly cancellation (23) and from equation (31).\n\ni\n\nThe electric\nR charge operator is given by Qem =\nP\n(1/2\u03c0) i Qi dx\u2202x \u03c6i , in accordance with Eq. (22).\nTherefore, one finds with the help of Eq. (25) that the\ncharge of field operator (24) is given by\nX\n\u03c3i Qi qi .\n(27)\nQem =\ni\n\nHere, as in the integer QHE, it is possible to have several electron operators differing from each other by some\nquantum numbers. The origin of these quantum numbers\nis discussed in Appendix D. We label different electron\noperators by an additional index \u03b1,\n\u0010 X\n\u0011\n\u03c8\u03b1 = exp i\nq\u03b1j \u03c6j ,\n(28)\nj\n\nand assume that the number of electrons coincides with\nthe number of channels.41 All electron fields must have a\nunit charge, which implies that\nX\n\u03c3i Qi q\u03b1i = 1,\n(29)\ni\n\nand appropriate relative statistical phases, \u03c0K\u03b1\u03b2 , compatible with relative locality and Fermi statistics. This\nimplies that the numbers\nX\n\u03c3i q\u03b1i q\u03b2i\n(30)\nK\u03b1\u03b2 =\ni\n\nmust be integers and that, for \u03b1 = \u03b2, these numbers must\nbe odd integers.\nIn Fig. 3 we schematically illustrate conditions (29)\nand (30) for the simple example of two channels with the\nsame chiralities. One sees that in contrast to the singlechannel case, in multi-channel models there is a freedom\nin choosing electron operators, even if the coupling constants Qi are fixed. This freedom implies that different\nmicroscopic QH wave-functions may lead to the same action in the low-energy limit. In this case the low-energy\nprojections of electronic operators may in principle be\ndifferent. In fact, multi-channel models are fully determined by the numbers q\u03b1i , while the values of coupling\nconstants Qi can be obtained by solving Eq. (29):\nX\n\u22121\nQi = \u03c3i\n.\n(31)\nqi\u03b1\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Schematic illustration of the conditions for electron operators in a chiral two-field model. The\nrequirement for the statistical phase of an electron operator\n2\n2\nto be fermionic is q\u03b11\n+ q\u03b12\n= 2k + 1. This means that\nthe end points of vectors\nq\n\u2261\n{q\u03b1i } (drawn in blue) lie on\n\u03b1\n\u221a\nthe circle of radius 2k + 1. The condition of unit charge,\nQ1 q\u03b11 + Q2 q\u03b12 = 1, implies that the end points of vectors q\u03b1\nlie on the line perpendicular to the vector Q \u2261 {Qi }. The\nlength of this vector is fixed\u221aby the anomaly cancellation condition (23), namely |Q| = \u03bd. Therefore the distance from\nthe line through\u221a\nthe end points of the vectors q\u03b1 to the origin\nis fixed to be 1/ \u03bd. We denote the angle between Q and the\nq1 axis by \u03b8+ , and the angle between the electron vectors by\n\u03b8\u2212 .\n\nNote that we have reformulated the constraints on the\nmatrix q as constraints on the matrix K. In Sec. III B we\nshow that the kinematic information about an effective\nmodel is encoded in the matrix K. More precisely, the\nspectra of statistical phases and charges of quasi-particles\nare entirely determined by K. For every filling factor this\nmatrix takes values from a discrete set. For instance, in\ntwo-channel models this corresponds to the discrete set\nof choices of lengths of electronic vectors q\u03b1 and their\nrelative angle \u03b8\u2212 (see Fig. 3). From the relation (30)\nit follows that the remaining freedom in the matrix q\nfor a given matrix K is the angle \u03b8+ of the simultaneous\nrotation of two vectors q\u03b1 . In Sec. III B we show that the\ndynamical properties of the model, such as the correlation\nfunctions, are not determined by the matrix K only, but\ndepend on the whole matrix q, e.g., on the angle \u03b8+ in\nthe case of two fields.\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe physical requirements for the effective theory can\ntherefore be formulated as constraints on the q-matrix.\nNamely, the requirement that elements of the matrix K\ngiven by Eq. (30) are integer numbers has to be accompanied by the condition that\nX\n\u22121\nK\u03b1\u03b2\n= \u03bd,\n(32)\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nB.\n\nLocal excitations\n\nNext, we determine all quasi-particle operators in accordance with the requirement that they have integer statistical phases relative to all electron fields (28). Quasi-\n\n\f7\nparticle operators are vertex operators of the form\n\u0011\n\u0010 X\n(33)\npj \u03c6j .\n\u03c8 = exp i\nj\n\nTheir statistical phases relative to electronic fields are\ngiven by\nX\n\u03b8pq\u03b1 = \u03c0\n\u03c3i pi q\u03b1i = \u03c0n\u03b1 .\n(34)\ni\n\nThe numbers n\u03b1 must be integers. The solution of Eq.\n(34),\nX\n\u22121\npi = \u03c3i\nqi\u03b2\nn\u03b2 ,\n(35)\n\u03b2\n\nis a linear combination with integer coefficients. Therefore, the whole set of allowed quasi-particle operators\nforms a lattice, which is dual to the lattice spanned by\nelectronic vectors q\u03b1i (see Appendix E and Ref. [8] for a\ndetailed discussion of this point).\nIt is interesting to note that the statistical phase and\nthe charge of a quasi-particle operator labeled by the\nnumbers n\u03b1 can be expressed solely in terms of the matrix\nK. For the statistical phase we have that\nX\nX\n\u03b8\n\u22121\n\u03c3i pi pi =\nn\u03b1 K\u03b1\u03b2\nn\u03b2 .\n=\n\u03c0\ni\n\n(36)\n\nIt also follows from Eqs. (31) and (35) that the charge of\nthe operator in (33) is given by\nX\nX\n\u22121\n\u03c3i Qi pi =\nK\u03b1\u03b2\nn\u03b2 .\n(37)\nQem =\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\nNote that the summation over the index \u03b1 in this equation may be viewed as the multiplication by the vector\n(1, 1, . . . , 1).\nIt may happen that different matrices K generate the\nsame set of quasi-particles. This is the case when corresponding electronic vectors q\u03b1i form different bases of\nthe same lattice (see the discussion in Appendix E).\nAn example of such an equivalence is depicted in Fig.\n4. In the language of matrices q, an equivalence is the\nconsequence\nP of the fact that an integral transformation\nq \u2032 \u03b1i = \u03b2 T\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03b2i (i.e., one with the elements T\u03b1\u03b2 and\n\u22121\nT\u03b1\u03b2\nbeing integer numbers) is nothing but an automorphism of the integral lattice generated by a change of\nbasis. Using definition (30), this equivalence may also be\nwritten as\nK \u2194 K \u2032 = T KT T ,\n\nC.\n\nScaling dimensions of local excitations\n\nWe conclude this section by presenting the correlation\nfunctions of the quasi-particle operators (33). A detailed\ncalculation of this function is contained in Appendix B\nand yields\nY\nh0|\u03c8 \u2020 (x, t)\u03c8(0, 0)|0i \u221d ei\u03c60 (n) (x + \u03c3i vi t)\u2212\u03b4i (n) , (39)\ni\n\nwhere the exponents are given by\n\u03b4i (n) = p2i =\n\nhX\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\ni\n\none must find all solutions, K, of Eq. (32) for a given \u03bd,\nup to equivalence defined by proper integral transformations (38). This procedure fixes the kinematic content\nof the theory.42 Second, one must fix those parameters\nthat are not constrained by the general conditions formulated at the beginning of Sec. II. These parameters\nare the propagation speeds, vi , of chiral edge modes. Finally, one should choose an explicit basis, q\u03b1 , of vectors\nlabeling electron field operators and consistent with the\nchosen matrix K.\n\ni2\n\u22121\nq\u03b1i\nn\u03b1 .\n\n(40)\n\nHere n \u2261 {n\u03b1 }, and \u03c60 is a phase, the exact value of\nwhich is discussed in Sec. VI.\nThe scaling dimension of the correlation function, defined via its long-time behavior, is given by\nX\n\u03b4i (n).\n(41)\n\u2206(n) =\ni\n\nExpressed in terms of the q-matrix, it reads\nX\nX\np2i =\n\u2206(n) =\nn\u03b1 (qq T )\u22121\n\u03b1\u03b2 n\u03b2 .\ni\n\n(42)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nAn explicit calculation of \u2206 in the non-chiral case with\ntwo fields is given in Appendix A. The scaling dimensions \u2206 are not fully determined by the matrix K, while\naccording to Eq. (36), the statistical phases\nX\n\u03b8\n\u03b4i \u03c3i\n=\n\u03c0\ni\n\n(43)\n\nare given by the matrix K. Comparing Eqs. (41) and\n(43) we conclude that \u2206 \u2265 \u03b8/\u03c0, where equality holds in\na purely chiral case.\n\n(38)\n\nSince the matrix T transforms an electronic basis, it preserves the charge of an electron. Taking into account Eq.\n(37), this important condition implies that the matrix T\nshould preserve the vector (1, 1, . . . , 1).\nIn conclusion, we propose the following strategy to find\ninequivalent models for a given filling factor. First of all,\n\nIV.\n\nMINIMAL MODELS FOR \u03bd = 2/m, AND\nSCALING DIMENSIONS OF THEIR\nQUASI-PARTICLE FIELDS\n\nIn this section we apply the ideas discussed above to\nthe particular case of filling factors \u03bd = 2/m. In Ref.\n\n\f8\n[15] it has been shown that models with a large number\nof edge channels may be unstable under the influence\nof disorder. To avoid such complications, we limit our\nanalysis to models with the smallest possible number of\nfields (see also the discussion at the end of Appendix D).\nMoreover, we consider models with minimal statistical\nphases of electron field operators, because they are most\nrelevant physically.43\nA direct solution of Eq. (32) is complicated. Fortunately, in Ref. [8], some general results have been proven\nfor the case where the statistical phases of electron operators are smaller than 7\u03c0: all two-field models for \u03bd = 2/m\nare described by matrices K of the following form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\na b\n.\n(44)\nKa =\nb a\nEquation (32) then imposes the following constraint on\nmatrix (44):\n\u03bd=\n\n2a \u2212 2b\n2\n=\n.\na2 \u2212 b 2\na+b\n\n(45)\n\nThus, for \u03bd = 2/m, the parameters a and b are related\nby a + b = m, where the odd integer a enumerates the\nmodels.\nFor a purely chiral model, the scaling dimensions of\ncorrelation functions (42) are given by the statistical\nphases. Therefore, for a K-matrix of the form (44), they\nare given by the expression\n\u2206(n) =\n\na2\n\n1\n[a(n21 + n22 ) \u2212 2bn1 n2 ],\n\u2212 b2\n\n(46)\n\nand the charge of excitations can be evaluated as\nQem =\n\nn1 + n2\n.\nm\n\n(47)\n\nFor non-chiral models, the expression for the charges of\nquasi-particles remains the same, while the scaling dimensions (42) depend on an additional parameter, \u03b8+ ,\n(see Appendix A). In Sec. V, we show that, in the limit\nof strong Coulomb interactions, this parameter takes the\nuniversal value \u03b8+ = 0. The scaling dimensions are then\ngiven by\n\u2206(n) =\n\n1\n[b(n21 + n22 ) \u2212 2an1 n2 ].\nb 2 \u2212 a2\n\n(48)\n\nWe have already mentioned that any two-field solution\nof Eq. (32) corresponds to one of the matrices (44), up to\nequivalence described by the transformations (38). An\nimportant example is the K-matrix proposed, e.g., in\nRef. [44]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\n.\n(49)\nK=\n0 \u22123\nThis matrix describes a non-chiral model of the \u03bd = 2/3\nstate obtained by particle-hole conjugation of the \u03bd = 1/3\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Illustration of equivalence of two QH\nlattices. For two channels of different chiralities, the statistical phase satisfies \u03b8/\u03c0 = q12 \u2212 q22 . Using this fact, one can\neasily see that the red vectors correspond to K-matrix (49)\nand the blue vectors correspond to the K-matrix (50). Note\nthat these pairs of vectors are just different bases of the same\nlattice (which is dual to the one shown in the figure). Therefore the spectra of statistical phases in models (49) and (50)\nare identical. Finally, the dashed line constrains the charge\nof the electrons to be 1. The fact that all electron vectors lie\non the same line implies that the constants Qi are the\nPsame\nfor both models. This means that the charges Qem =\nqi Qi\nof excitations in one model coincide with those in the second\nmodel. Here we choose the angle \u03b8+ = 0, in accordance with\nthe conclusion of Sec. V.\n\nstate. In this state, the density at the edge first increases\nto \u03bd = 1 and then drops to zero, which implies the presence of two edge channels with opposite chiralities. Another K-matrix for \u03bd = 2/3 state appears in the context\nof the composite fermion approach:45\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\n.\n(50)\nK=\n2 1\nIt turns out that model (49) is equivalent to (50), in the\nsense of (38). Indeed, one can apply an integral change of\nvariables transforming one K-matrix into the other one:\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n1 2\n1 2\n1 0\n1 0\n.\n=\n2 1\n0 \u22121\n0 \u22123\n2 \u22121\nThis transformation is of the type of (38), because it has\nthe property that\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\n1 0\n,\n=\n2 \u22121\n2 \u22121\nand it leaves the vector (1, 1) invariant. The equivalence\nof these two models is illustrated in Fig. 4.\nFor \u03bd = 2/3, the matrices (44) with the smallest diagonal elements (i.e., with smallest statistical phases of\nelectron operators) are the following ones:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n5 \u22122\n3 0\n(51)\n, K5 =\nK3 =\n\u22122 5\n0 3\n\n\f9\nand\nK1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 2\n2 1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nK\u22121 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121 4\n4 \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n(52)\n\nNote that the matrices (52) have negative determinants,\nand hence, in contrast to the matrices (51), they describe\nnon-chiral states.

For each model described by a\nmatrix Ka , we provide the general expression for the scaling dimensions \u2206(n) of quasi-particle operators labeled by\npairs of integer numbers (n1 , n2 ). The minimal values \u2206q for\nexcitations of charge q, as well as the scaling dimensions of\nelectron operators are listed in the right column.\n\nIt is important to note that, for every model, the minimal scaling dimension is \u2206min = \u22061/3 , i.e., the operator\nof the Laughlin quasi-particle is the most relevant one.\nWe note that between four models, the model K1 is presumably most stable with respect to disorder, because it\nhas the largest scaling dimension \u22060 . Moreover, the electron operator in this model is the most relevant operator\namong operators with unit charge. In addition, numerical simulations46 and some microscopic considerations44\nconfirm that the model with matrix K1 is most likely\nto describe the \u03bd = 2/3 state. However, some signs\nof a phase transition in the \u03bd = 2/3 state have been\nobserved.47 This indicates that other models may also\nbe realized under certain conditions; see Ref. [8].\nV.\n\nTHE ROLE OF COULOMB INTERACTIONS\n\nWe have shown in Sec. III C (see also Appendix A)\nthat, in the non-chiral case, the scaling dimensions of excitations depend not only on the \"kinematic\" structure\nof the theory encoded in the K-matrix, but also on the\nangle \u03b8+ . This angle parametrizes the relation between\nthe propagating modes and the electron operators. There\nis, however, an important class of systems in which this\nparameter appears to be uniquely and universally fixed.\nThis is, for instance, the case in a system with two edge\nmodes and strong Coulomb interactions. This fact has\n\nbeen discussed in Ref. [35]. The results of the analysis in\nRef. [35] are essentially in perfect agreement with the experimental data of Refs. [27,28,29,30]. Although in Ref.\n[35] only the case \u03bd = 2 is considered, we will show below that the conclusion of this analysis applies without\nsignificant changes to fractional fluids, too.\nLet us assume that effects of disorder are negligible.\nThis may be a reasonable assumption for an electronic\nMZ interferometer, the size of which is typically only a\nfew microns. In this case, the generic form of the Hamiltonian is given by a sum of the free Hamiltonian, the\nCoulomb interaction term, and a term describing the interaction with an external electromagnetic field a\u03bc :\nH = H0 + HC + Hint [a].\n\n(53)\n\nWe show below that the actual form of the free Hamiltonian H0 is not important.\nAssuming the distance, a, between the edge channels\nto be of the order of their thickness, l, or smaller (see\nFig. 5 for notations), the Coulomb interaction term can\nbe written as:\nZ\nHC = (1/2) dxdx\u2032 \u03c1em (x)UC (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03c1em (x\u2032 ), (54)\n\nwhere \u03c1em (x) is the total one-dimensional charge density\nat the point x, and UC (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) is the Coulomb potential. We further assume that the interaction is screened\nat distances d, with L \u226b d \u226b a, where L is the size of the\ninterferometer. This screening can occur due to the presence of the back gate, or the massive air bridge (see Ref.\n[35] for a more detailed discussion). As a consequence,\nwe can neglect the dispersion of the Coulomb interaction\nand write UC (x \u2212 y) = V \u03b4(x \u2212 y), where the interaction\nconstant, V \u223c ln(d/a), is large. Finally, the interaction\nwith an external electromagnetic field is described by\nZ\nHint [a] = \u2212 dx\u03c1em (x)at (x),\n(55)\n\nin the gauge ax = 0.\nIn the limit when ln(d/a) \u226b 1, the Coulomb interaction exceeds the correlation energy. One of the most important consequences of this fact is that, independently\nof the form of free Hamiltonian, the full Hamiltonian is\ndiagonal in the basis where one mode, \u03c61 , is charged,\nwith Q1 /2\u03c0\u2202x \u03c61 = \u03c1em , and the other one, \u03c62 , is a dipole\nmode of total charge zero. Thus we can write\nZ\nZ\n1 X\n1\n2\nH=\nQ1 at \u2202x \u03c61 ,\nvi (\u2202x \u03c6i ) \u2212\n(56)\n4\u03c0 i\n2\u03c0\n\nwhere the speed of the charged mode, v1 = \u03c3H V , is much\nlarger than the speed v2 of the dipole mode determined\nby the free Hamiltonian (see the discussion at the end of\nSec. II B). Comparing Eq. (56) with (22), we conclude\nthat Q2 = 0, which means that the dipole mode does not\ncouple to the external electromagnetic field. The condition of the \u221a\nanomaly cancellation (23) therefore implies\nthat Q1 = \u03bd. Thus, the angle between the vector Q\nand the q1 -axis is fixed to the universal value \u03b8+ = 0.\nThis is illustrated graphically in Fig. 5.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Illustration of the effects of the strong\nlong-range Coulomb interaction. Left panel: important spatial scales at the QH edge are shown: the width of the channels l, the distance between two channels a, and the screening\nlength of the Coulomb interaction d. The universal limit is\nachieved when d \u226b a, l. Right panel: possible configuration\nof electronic excitations (blue vectors) in the universal strong\ninteraction limit. Exactly this situation arises at \u03bd = 2, as\nshown in Ref. [35].\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF\nCHARGES AND SCALING DIMENSIONS OF\nQUASI-PARTICLES\n\nWe have shown in Sec. IV that, for the filling factor\n\u03bd = 2/3, there are several possible models satisfying all\nthe physical requirements formulated in Sec. II. It is\nworth noticing that all these models have the same minimal fractional charge, 1/3, but different spectra of scaling dimensions. The experiment proposed in this section\nmay allow one to determine scaling dimensions and, as\na result, to identify the physically relevant model of the\nQH edge. This experiment is based on the idea to make\nuse of an electronic MZ interferometer.\nElectronic MZ interferometers have been realized and\ninvestigated experimentally in Refs. [27,28,29,30]. The\nexperimental sample consists of a two-dimensional electron gas confined to a region of the shape of a so called\nCorbino disk (see Fig. 6). In the QHE regime, several effectively one-dimensional conducting channels are formed\nat the edge. The modes in these edge channels are used\nas beams in the electronic MZ interferometer, while two\nQPCs serve as beam splitters. Two Ohmic contacts connected to the Corbino disk emit and absorb electrons.\nOne contact is biased with a voltage \u25b3\u03bc > 0, and the\nother one is grounded and serves as a sink for a current\nI.\nThere are two paths for quasi-particles to travel from\nthe upper Ohmic contact to the lower one. The first possibilities are to pass the left QPC and to be reflected off\nthe right QPC. The second possibilities are to bounce off\nthe left QPC and then to pass the right one. It is easy\nto see that a nonzero magnetic flux is enclosed by these\ntwo paths. Consequently, the current I oscillates as a\nfunction of the magnetic flux through the interferometer.\nThe AB flux may be varied with the help of a modulation gate near one of the arms of the interferometer that\ncan slightly change the length of this arm (see also the\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) A Mach-Zehnder interferometer is\nschematically shown as a Corbino disk, containing a twodimensional electron gas, shown in gray shadow. In a strong\nmagnetic field, at a filling factor \u03bd = 2/3, two 1D chiral channels are formed at the edges and propagate along the boundaries of the two-dimensional electron gas (shown by thin black\nlines). Both channels are partially transmitted at the left and\nright QPCs. A bias voltage \u2206\u03bc, applied at the upper Ohmic\ncontact, causes a current I to flow to the lower Ohmic contact. This current is caused by scattering of quasi-particles\nat the QPCs and involves an interference contribution sensitive to the magnetic flux \u03a6 that can be changed by a slight\nmodulation of the length of one of the arms.\n\ndiscussion in Appendix C 2).\nWe assume that there are several types of excitations,\nlabeled by integers n\u03b1 , which can tunnel between the\narms at the QPCs.

The expectation\nvalues of the zero-modes can be related to the applied\nvoltage bias \u2206\u03bc by appealing to the well known electrostatic formula \u2206\u03bc = \u03b4hH0 i/\u03b4Qem . From this equation it follows that h\u03c01 i = \u2206\u03bc/v1 , while for the dipole\nmode h\u03c02 i = 0, because it is not biased.48 We assume\nthat charge fluctuations are negligible due to the large\ncapacitances of edge channels connected to Ohmic contacts.

This periodicity allows one to\nseparate the contributions of different excitations to the\ncurrent. In the context of our theory, the quasi-particle\nperiodicity is related to our choice of a tunneling Hamiltonian, which is different from the one in Refs. [24] and [26]\nand leads to a non-commutativity of tunneling Hamiltonians at different spatial points. This non-commutativity\noriginates from the topological character of quasi-particle\nexcitations in a fractional QH state and is a consequence\nof open boundary conditions specific to the MZ interferometer.\nWe think that the non-commutativity of tunneling\nHamiltonians calls for additional theoretical analysis and,\npossibly, for experimental tests. A theoretical analysis of\nthis problem should include a concrete model of Ohmic\ncontacts, which may influence the physics of processes\nin an MZ interferometer. It is also interesting to generalize our analysis to fractions, such as \u03bd = 5/2, which\nare possibly described by non-Abelian QH states, and to\nthe case of FP interferometers, where new physics may\nemerge.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank V.

As it has already been mentioned, in\nthe general (non-chiral) case, the scaling dimension is a\nfunction of the full matrix q. Therefore, apart from the\nmatrix K, it depends only on one additional variable,\nwhich can be fixed by choosing the Hamiltonian. We are\ninterested in a matrix K of the following form:\n!\na b\nK=\n.\n(A1)\nb a\nThe connection between matrices K and q in the nonchiral case is K = q\u03c3q T . Therefore we can introduce the\nfollowing parametrization of the matrix q,\n!\n\u221a\ncosh \u03b81 sinh \u03b81\nq/ a =\n,\n(A2)\ncosh \u03b82 sinh \u03b82\n\nwhere cosh(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 ) = b/a. Although the case a < 0\nrequires a different parametrization, it leads to the same\nresult.\nThe evaluation of the scaling dimension \u2206(n) =\nn(qq T )\u22121 n requires to invert the matrix:\n!\ncosh 2\u03b81\ncosh(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )\nT\nqq = a\n.\n(A3)\ncosh(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )\ncosh 2\u03b82\nFor convenience, we introduce the angle \u03b8+ = \u03b81 + \u03b82\nwhich takes arbitrary values, and the angle \u03b8\u2212 = \u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82\nwhich is fixed by the condition\ncosh \u03b8\u2212 = b/a.\n\n(A4)\n\nInverting the matrix qq T (see Eq. (A3)), we find the following expression for the scaling dimensions:\n1\n\u2206(n) = 2\nb \u2212 a2\n\nn1\nn2\n\n!T\n\nA\u2212 B\nB A+\n\n!\n\nn1\nn2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere\nA\u00b1 = b cosh \u03b8+ \u00b1\nB = \u2212a cosh \u03b8+ .\n\np\nb2 \u2212 a2 sinh \u03b8+ ,\n\nWe see that \u2206 indeed depends on the additional free\nparameter, the angle \u03b8+ .\nIf we assume that the strong long-range Coulomb interaction is a dominant contribution to the Hamiltonian,\nthen we may approximate q11 = q12 , or equivalently,\n\u03b82 = \u2212\u03b81 . This condition leads to cosh \u03b8+ = 1 and\nsinh \u03b8+ = 0, so that the expression for the scaling dimension simplifies:\n1\n\u2206(n) = 2\nb \u2212 a2\n\nn1\nn2\n\n!T\n\nb \u2212a\n\u2212a b\n\n!\n\nn1\nn2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(A6)\n\nCalculating the product, we arrive at the final result (48).\nNext, we evaluate the exponents \u03b41 and \u03b42 . In the\nchiral case, which we consider as an example, K = qq T ,\nand the following parametrization is required\n!\n\u221a\ncos \u03b81 sin \u03b81\n(A7)\nq/ a =\ncos \u03b82 sin \u03b82\nwith the condition that cos(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81 ) = b/a. Then, using\ndefinition (40), we find\na\n(n1 cos \u03b81 \u2212 n2 cos \u03b82 )2 ,\na2 \u2212 b 2\na\n(n1 sin \u03b81 \u2212 n2 sin \u03b82 )2 .\n\u03b42 (n) = 2\na \u2212 b2\n\n\u03b41 (n) =\n\n(A8)\n(A9)\n\nThus, we see that by measuring the exponents \u03b41 and\n\u03b42 one can in principle extract the parameter \u03b8+ . However, we stress again that, for strong Coulomb interaction, \u03b8+ = 0. In this case, expressions for exponents\n\n\f14\nsimplify. Namely, taking into account that a + b = 2/\u03bd,\nwe find that\n\u03b41 (n) =\n\n(n1 \u2212 n2 )2\n,\n2(a \u2212 b)\n\n\u03b42 (n) =\n\n\u03bd\n(n1 + n2 )2 .\n4\n\n(A10)\n\nIn the non-chiral case, analogous calculations lead to similar expressions\n\u03b41 (n) =\n\n(n1 \u2212 n2 )2\n,\n2(b \u2212 a)\n\n\u03b42 (n) =\n\n\u03bd\n(n1 + n2 )2 .\n4\n\n(A11)\n\nAPPENDIX B: CORRELATION FUNCTION AT\nFINITE TEMPERATURE AND ASYMPTOTICS\nOF TUNNELING CURRENT\n\nUsing the Gaussian character of the edge fields\n\u03c6i , the\n\u0001 functions for the operators \u03c8n =\nP correlation\nexp i j pj (n)\u03c6j may be written in the following form:\nih\u03c8n\u2020 (x, t)\u03c8n (0, 0)i = ei\u03c60 Kn (x, t),\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere the first factor is the zero-mode contribution given\nby Eq.

Substituting the\ncorrelation function (69) into Eq.

Tunneling of Laughlin quasiparticles is described by the Hamiltonian HL +HR ,where\n\u2020\n\u2020\nHl = tl \u03c8U\n(xl )\u03c8D (xl ) + t\u2217l \u03c8D\n(xl )\u03c8U (xl ), l = L, R,\n(C1)\nare the contributions at two spatially separated points\nxL and xR . It is interesting to calculate the commutator\nof HL and HR . For this purpose, we first have to find\n\n\f15\nthe commutation relations for quasi-particle operators in\na system with two edges.\nWe remind the reader that only local excitations may\ntunnel at QPCs. One of the conditions of locality reads:\n[\u2202x \u03c6U , \u03c8D ] = 0,\n\n[\u2202x \u03c6D , \u03c8U ] = 0,\n\n(C2)\n\nwhich means that a quasi-particle at one edge does not\ncreate a charge density at the other edge. This condition\nimplies that [\u03c8U , \u03c8D ] = 0. On the other hand, for quasiparticle operators at the same edge, in the case of open\nboundary conditions, we have that\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8\u03b1 (x)\u03c8\u03b1 (x\u2032 ) = e(i\u03c0/m)sign(x \u2212x) \u03c8\u03b1 (x\u2032 )\u03c8\u03b1 (x),\n\n(C3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = U, D, and the coordinate x starts at the Ohmic\ncontact and increases in the direction of the chirality of\nthe corresponding channel.\nThe sign of the statistical phase in this expression is\ndetermined by the sign of the right-hand-side of Eq. (12)\nand depends on the chirality of the channel. Assuming\nxR > xL (see Fig. 7), we arrive at the following result:\n\nline.49 According to the boundary conditions for the excitations in the MZ interferometer, we choose the Ohmic\ncontacts as end points of Wilson lines (see the discussion\nin Appendix D). Thus the tunneling Hamiltonians are\ngiven by Wilson lines going from one Ohmic contact to\nthe other:\nh i Z\ni\nh i Z\ni\nHl = tl exp \u221a\ndr\u03bc b\u03bc + t\u2217l exp \u221a\ndr\u03bc b\u03bc ,\nm \u03b3l\nm \u2212\u03b3l\n(C5)\nwhere b\u03bc is the Chern-Simons field, and \u03b3l is the line\ngoing from the upper Ohmic contact to the lower one\nthrough the l-th QPC, see Figs. 8a and 8b.50 The product of these operators, HR HL , is represented by the configuration of Wilson lines shown schematically in Fig. 8c.\nOn the other hand, the permutation HL HR of these operators may be represented by the lines oppositely ordered\nin time. According to Chern-Simons theory the corresponding braidings again yield result (C4). Interestingly,\nfor a FP interferometer, the corresponding braidings are\ntrivial (see Fig. 9); therefore the tunneling Hamiltonians\ncommute.\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c8U\n(xL )\u03c8D (xL )\u03c8U\n(xR )\u03c8D (xR )\n\u2020\n\u2020\n= e2\u03c0i/m \u03c8U\n(xR )\u03c8D (xR )\u03c8U\n(xL )\u03c8D (xL ). (C4)\n\nThus we conclude that for the tunneling Hamiltonians\ndefined in Eq. (C1), [HL , HR ] 6= 0. Note that this is\nnot the case for a Fabry-Perot type interferometer, where\nthe order of tunneling points with respect to chirality is\ndifferent on different arms. Therefore contributions to\nthe statistical phase from inner and outer edges cancel,\nand the Hamiltonians HL and HR commute.\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) The Mach-Zehnder interferometer and\nWilson lines are schematically shown.

Panel c: timeexpanded representation of two Wilson lines. One can see that\nthe lines are topologically identical, therefore Hamiltonians\nHL and HR commute.\n\nNon-commutativity of tunneling Hamiltonians has often been claimed in the literature to be unphysical. It\nhas therefore been proposed to use Klein factors to ensure their commutativity. To clarify the nature of Klein\nfactors, we consider for a moment the boundary conditions which correspond to a closed geometry.\nIn this case\n\u221a\nthe quasi-particle operators \u03c8\u03b1 = e(i/ m)\u03c6\u03b1 (x) are mfold multi-valued operators. This is because the field\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x) is in fact an integral of the density \u03c1\u03b1 over a\nclosed contour that can have different numbers of winding, \u03ba = 0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1. Hence we can write\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x) = \u03c6\u03b1 + 2\u03c0(x + \u03baW\u03b1 )\u03c0\u03b1 + osc., \u03b1 = U, D, (C6)\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1 and \u03c0\u03b1 are the zero modes, and W\u03b1 is the\nlength of the boundary \u03b1.\nWe stress that only relative branch numbers are physically observable. Indeed, the two zero modes \u03c0\u03b1 , where\n\n\f16\n\u221a\n\u03b1 = U, D, are quantized as W\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1 = N\u03b1 / m. However,\nany closed electronic system contains an integer number,\nN , of electrons, which imposes the following constraint\non\n\u221a\nthe total charge operator: (WU \u03c0U + WD \u03c0D )/ m = N .\nThis limitation on the eigenvalues of the operators \u03c0\u03b1 ,\nwhich any physically allowed state should satisfy, leads\nto the fact that\nF \u2261 e(2\u03c0i/\n\n\u221a\nm)WU \u03c0U\n\n= e\u2212(2\u03c0i/\n\n\u221a\n\nm)WD \u03c0D\n\n.\n\n(C7)\n\nWe use the winding number \u03ba as an additional index\nthat denotes the quasi-particle branch, \u03c8\u03b1,\u03ba = \u03c8\u03b1 F \u03ba .\nHere \u03c8\u03b1 stands for the case where \u03ba = 0, i.e., for the\nbranch that starts from one of the Ohmic contacts. In\nthe language of Wilson lines, every branch is given by a\nline with the corresponding number of windings.\nIf several branches are present, then one should\ntake into account all possible processes in the tunneling Hamiltonian including those that change the quasiparticle branch number. Therefore, in general, the tunneling Hamiltonian can be written as\nX\n\u2020\nHl =\n(C8)\n(xl )\u03c8U,\u03ba+\u03ba\u2032 (xl ) + h.c.\ntl,\u03ba\u2032 \u03c8D,\u03ba\n\u03ba\u2032\n\nThe commutation relations for quasi-particle operators\n(C3) are easily generalized:\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8\u03ba (x)\u03c8\u03ba\u2032 (x ) = e\n\n(2i\u03c0/m)(\u03ba\u2212\u03ba\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\n\u00d7 e(i\u03c0/m)sign(x \u2212x) \u03c8\u03ba\u2032 (x\u2032 )\u03c8\u03ba (x),\n\n(C9)\n\nand we arrive at the important conclusion that, in general, Hamiltonians (C8), taken at different spatial points,\ndo not commute.\nIn order to put our discussion into the context of previous work, we rewrite Hamiltonian (C8) in a slightly\ndifferent form:\nX\n\u2020\nHl =\ntl,\u03ba F \u03ba \u03c8D\n(xl )\u03c8U (xl ) + h.c.,\n(C10)\n\u03ba\n\nwhere the operator F introduced earlier obviously plays\nthe role of a Klein factor. Interestingly, in the specific\ncase when only the amplitudes tL,1 and tR,0 are non-zero,\ntunneling Hamiltonians (C10) do commute at different\nspatial points. Moreover, in the language of Wilson lines\nthe multiplication of the tunneling Hamiltonian with the\nKlein factor F is equivalent to adding a loop to the corresponding Wilson line, so that it goes all the way around\nthe interferometer. It is easy to see that adding such\na loop to the blue line in Fig. 8 makes it topologically\nequivalent to the red line. Therefore the Hamiltonians,\nafter such manipulation, indeed commute.\nHere we have to admit that the Klein factors introduced earlier in the literature are usually supposed to\ncommute with the quasi-particle operators \u03c8\u03b1 (see, for\ninstance, Refs. [22] and [25]). In other words, they act\non some additional Hilbert space. This situation, however, is not satisfactory, because it contradicts the very\n\nwell known aspect of the QHE that there exists a gap for\nexcitations in the bulk, and the only degrees of freedom\navailable are the edge excitations \u03c6\u03b1 (x), including zero\nmodes \u03c6\u03b1 and \u03c0\u03b1 . Therefore, we think that Klein factors\nshould be expressed in terms of the same modes as the\noperators \u03c8\u03b1 (see, e.g., Ref. [51]). On the other hand,\nchoosing specific Hamiltonians that commute does not\nappear to be physical and needs, to say the least, additional justification. Moreover, it is important that Klein\nfactors may be introduced only in a system with a closed\ngeometry, where multivalued excitations may exist. The\nstrong coupling to Ohmic contacts, as in the case of an\nMZ interferometer considered in this paper, requires open\nboundary conditions. Therefore we insist that our form\n(C1) of the tunneling Hamiltonian is correct and use it\nin Sec. VI for calculations.\nOur next remark concerns the statement made in the\nliterature24,26,52,53 that it is impossible to observe a coherent part of the quasi-particle current. It has been\nclaimed that several degeneracies are present in a system which lead to strong dephasing via two mechanisms.\nWithin our approach the first mechanism24 can be interpreted as being based on the fact that there exists a set\nof quasi-degenerate states which correspond to a shift of\nboth edges.6 One may parametrize them as following:\nWU \u03c0U\nl\n\u221a\n=N+ ,\nm\nm\n\nWD \u03c0D\nl\n\u221a\n=N\u2212 ,\nm\nm\n\n(C11)\n\nwhere l = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1. We denote\n\u221a these states with\n|li, and write |l + 1i = ei(\u03c6U +\u03c6D )/ m |li. The density\nmatrix for the interferometer, with the QH edges in an\nequilibrium state, can be written as\n\u03c10 =\n\nm\u22121\nX\nl=0\n\nrl |lihl|.\n\n(C12)\n\nThe coherent part of the current generated by tunneling\nHamiltonian (C8) and averaged with the density matrix\n(C12) reads\nXX\n\u2032\nILR \u221d\nrl tL,\u03ba t\u2217R,\u03ba\u2032 hl|F \u03ba\u2212\u03ba |li.\n(C13)\nl\n\n\u03ba,\u03ba\u2032\n\nIn our paper we use tunneling Hamiltonian (C1) with\n\u03ba = \u03ba\u2032 . Therefore\nP the summation over the quantum number l is trivial, l rl = 1, and does not lead to any physical effect. In contrast, using additional Klein factors24\nimplies that \u03ba\u2212\u03ba\u2032 = 1. Thus, in Eq. (C13), the contribution from every shifted state |li acquires the phase factor\nhl|F |li = e2\u03c0il/m . Law et al.24 further assumed equal\npopulation rl = 1/m, so that, after summation over l,\nthe coherent part of the quasi-particle current vanishes.\nIn the argument sketched above, in addition to the specific choice \u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u2032 = 1 that has been addressed earlier,\nthe assumption of the degeneracy of states |li, or equivalently, the high temperature limit rl = 1/m, is of crucial\nimportance. We note, however, that the shift (C11) leads\nto charging of the edges, and the corresponding energy\n\n\f17\nis not small. The experiments [27-30] have been done\nin the regime where the temperature and the bias are\nsmaller than this charging energy, and we do not see any\ndifficulties, in principle, to achieve such a regime in the\nfractional QHE case.\nA second possible mechanism of dephasing is described\nin Ref. [52]. An additional Berry phase shift between two\ntunneling paths may appear if some number l of localized\nquasi-particles are present in the bulk. In this case the\ncoherent contribution to the tunneling current acquires\nthe phase factor e2\u03c0il/m , which is similar to the one encountered in the first mechanism of dephasing discussed\nabove. If the number, l, of quasi-particles fluctuates,\nthen the coherent part of the quasi-particle current may\nvanish,\nX\nILR \u221d\ne2\u03c0il/m \u2192 0,\nl\n\nas a result of averaging over these fluctuations. We would\nlike to stress that this mechanism may be avoided either by reducing the temperature, so that the activation\nof spontaneous phase slips is slow, or by using a highquality sample. For instance, in the integer QHE case\nsuch telegraph processes have indeed been observed in\nthe experiment [30] and then reduced by tuning the system's parameters.\nTo conclude, we recall that the MZ interferometer,\nbeing a system that is strongly coupled to Ohmic contacts, requires open boundary conditions. This leads to\nthe non-commutativity of tunneling Hamiltonians taken\nat different spatial points. We think that the noncommutativity of spatially separated operators naturally\nfollows from the topological character of the effective theory, according to which the quasi-particles are not completely local objects, because they have \"tails\" in form\nof Wilson lines. Moreover, the non-locality in the effective theory does not contradict the local character of\nthe underlying microscopic theory which does not necessary manifest itself in the low-energy limit. The Klein\nfactors, which have been introduced in earlier papers to\nensure the commutativity of tunneling Hamiltonians, require in fact closed boundary conditions and are therefore\nnot applicable to MZ interferometers. Moreover, we have\nshown that even when Klein factors may be used, they\ncannot guarantee the commutativity of tunneling Hamiltonians in general, while the specific choice proposed in\nRefs. [22] and [24] needs further justification. Finally, we\nremark that the strong suppression of the phase coherence suggested in Refs. [24] and [52] is not a fundamental\nproperty of the fractional QHE, and may be avoided in\nfuture experiments at sufficiently low temperatures.\n2.\n\nPeriodicity in magnetic flux and modulation\ngate voltage\n\nThe purpose of this discussion is to clarify the origin\nof the quasi-particle periodicity in physical observables.\n\nLet us first analyze the dependence of the energies of the\nzero modes eigenstates |li (see Appendix C 1) of a QH\nfluid at \u03bd = 1/m on the singular magnetic flux \u03a6 threading the Corbino disk. This problem has been considered\nby Thouless and Gefen in Ref. [54]. Following their argument, we note that the main contribution to the energy\ncomes from Coulomb interactions. Therefore, under variation of the flux \u03a6, the energies of zero modes eigenstates\nof a QH fluid, isolated inside a Corbino disk, follow the\nbranches with a fixed number of electrons. However, if\nthe Corbino disk is weakly coupled to metallic reservoirs,\nthe number of electrons in the QH fluid is not conserved.\nTherefore, if the ground state energy initially grows with\nthe flux \u03a6, it then switches to another branch by changing the number of electrons by 1 and starts to decrease\nwith the flux. This behavior (shown by the red line in\nFig. 10) repeats periodically with a period equal to m\u03a60 .\nThe electronic periodicity is restored if one takes into\naccount the possibility of quasi-particle tunneling between the inner and outer edges of the Corbino disk. Such\na perturbation mixes the states |li, with l = 0, . . . , m \u2212 1\nand opens a gap at the degeneracy points (see Fig. 10).\nAs a result, under an adiabatic variation of the magnetic\nflux, the QH fluid will follow the lowest energy state with\nthe electronic period \u03a60 .\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) The energy spectrum of a QH fluid\nat \u03bd = 1/3 in a Corbino disk is schematically shown. The\ndashed lines show the Coulomb charging energy of an isolated QH fluid, as a function of the magnetic flux \u03a6 threading\nthe Corbino disk. Different branches correspond to different\nnumbers of quasi-particles at the edges. In the presence of\ninter-edge quasi-particle tunneling, and for weak coupling to\nmetallic reservoirs, an energy gap opens at the degeneracy\npoints, where different branches intersect. If the flux varies\nadiabatically, the QH fluid follows the ground state, so that\nthe energy is a periodic function of the flux with the electronic period \u03a60 . If the variation of the flux is relatively fast\n(quasi-particle tunneling is weak), the QH fluid follows the\n\"electronic\" branch (shown in red) along the lines l=0 and\nl=3, so that the number of electrons at the edge changes by\none. In this case the energy oscillates with the quasi-particle\nperiod 3\u03a60 .\n\nFar away from equilibrium, when a potential difference\nis applied to metallic reservoirs and a charge current flows\n\n\f18\nthrough an MZ interferometer, the physical situation is\ngenerally more complicated. However, one can still rely\non the effective theory by taking into account the described above dependence of the energy of zero modes on\nthe magnetic flux and writing the Hamiltonian as\n\u00132\n\u0012\nX vs Z\n2\u03c0 \u03a6\n\u221a\n. (C14)\ndx \u2202x \u03c6s +\nH=\n4\u03c0\nWs m \u03a60\ns=U,D\n\nWe stress that the the insertion of the singular flux\ndoes not affect the AB phase. This follows form the\nfact that there\nR two contributions to the integral\n\u221a are\n\u03b4\u03c6AB = (1/ m) \u03b3 dr\u03bc \u03b4b\u03bc over the MZ contour \u03b3. One\ncontribution arises from the change in the field b\u03bc due\nto the variation of the external field A\u03bc , as follows from\nrelation (D7). The second contribution comes from the\nvariation of the total charge inside the MZ contour, repelled by the singular flux, according to relation (D1).\nThese two effects cancel each other exactly, which can be\nviewed as a result of screening of the external field A\u03bc by\nthe QH system.\nTo determine the current through the interferometer\nthe averaging in the linear-response formula (65) must\nbe done with respect to the equilibrium density matrix\n\u03c10 = e\u2212\u03b2H /Z0 . In the thermodynamic limit, the fields\n\u2202x \u03c6s can be shifted when performing the averaging so as\nto eliminate the dependence on the magnetic flux from\nHamiltonian (C14). This implies that the only physical\nconsequence of the insertion of the singular magnetic flux\nin a finite size Corbino disk is the Coulomb blockade\neffect which has an electronic periodicity. However, this\neffect is absent in MZ interferometers due to the strong\ncoupling to Ohmic contacts.\nThe modulation of the AB phase via the insertion of\na point-like flux is an idealization. In a typical experiment, the magnetic field can be changed only uniformly.\nIn this case the phase acquired by a quasi-particle is no\nlonger a topological number and may depend, e.g., on\nthe processes in Ohmic contacts in a complicated way.\nTherefore, it appears to be more appropriate to investigate the periodicity of AB oscillations by changing the\nmodulation gate voltage instead of changing the magnetic\nfield.\nA gate voltage applied at the edge of a QH liquid\nleads to the displacement y(x) of the edge at the point\nx. This displacement may be described as an accumulation of background 1D charge densities, \u03b4\u03c1i (x) =\n2\n\u03c3i Q2i y(x)/2\u03c0lB\n, in the edge channels. In the presence\nof these densities, the fields \u03c6i are redefined as \u2202\u03c6i \u2192\n2\n\u2202\u03c6i + \u03c3i Qi y(x)/lB\n. As a consequence, the correlation\n\u2020\nfunction h\u03c8 (x, t)\u03c8(0, 0)i of an excitation\neipi \u03c6i acRx \u2032 \u03c8 =\n\u2032\n2\n. This\nquires a phase shift \u03b4\u03c60 = \u03c3i pi Qi 0 dx y(x )/lB\nphase shift is proportional\nto\nthe\ncharge\nof\nthe\nquasiP\n\u03c3\np\nQ\n,\nand\nto\nthe\narea\nof\nthe\nparticle, Qem (n) R=\ni\ni\ni\ni\nx\ndeformation S = 0 dx\u2032 y(x\u2032 ). Therefore the phase shift\nmay be interpreted as an AB phase:\n2\n\u03b4\u03c60 (n) = Qem (n) * S/lB\n= 2\u03c0Qem(n)\n\n\u03b4\u03a6\n,\n\u03a60\n\n(C15)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03a6 is the variation of the magnetic flux through the\nclosed path of the MZ interferometer, resulting from the\ndeformation. For simplicity of notations, this additional\nphase (C15) is included in the tunneling amplitudes in\nEq. (59).\nTo conclude, in our model, the periodicity of AB oscillations in the average current is determined by the\ncharges of quasi-particles that tunnel. To verify this prediction, one should compare the periodicity in the weak\ntunneling regime, where only electron tunneling is possible, with the one in the weak backscattering regime,\nwhere the tunneling of quasi-particles is most relevant.\nAPPENDIX D: CHERN-SIMONS THEORY AND\nILLUSTRATION OF HOLOGRAPHY\n\nIn this appendix we illustrate the holographic principle\nby constructing the bulk effective models and showing\nthat they determine the minimal edge models discussed\nin Sec. III. We assume that the edge currents originate\nas deformations of incompressible fluids. These fluids\nare described by a family of separately conserved bulk\ncurrents, ji\u03bc , with \u2202\u03bc ji\u03bc = 0. We solve the continuity\nequations by introducing potentials bi\u03bc ,\nji\u03bc =\n\n1\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202 \u03bd b\u03bbi ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(D1)\n\nwhere the Einstein summation convention is assumed.\nThe currents are invariant under the gauge transformations bi\u03bc \u2192 bi\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc fi . By counting dimensions, it is easy\nto see that the gauge invariant action for these potentials,\nX Z\nSbulk [bi ] = (1/4\u03c0)\n\u03c3i\nd3 r\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb b\u03bci \u2202 \u03bd b\u03bbi ,\n(D2)\nD\n\ni\n\nhas zero dimension, while all other possible terms have\nlower dimensions, i.e., are irrelevant at low energies. For\nexample, the Maxwell-like action has dimension \u22121.\nThe total electric current can be written asPa linear\n\u03bc\ncombination of incompressible currents jem\n= i Qi ji\u03bc .\nHence the term in the action describing the interaction\nwith an external electromagnetic field is:\nZ\n\u03bc\nd3 rA\u03bc jem\nSint [bi , A] =\nD\nXZ\n= (1/2\u03c0)\nd3 rA\u03bc Qi \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd bi\u03bb . (D3)\ni\n\nD\n\nIntegrating out the fields bi\u03bc , we arrive at an effective\naction for the electromagnetic field in the Chern-Simons\nform:\nZ\nX\n\u03c3i Q2i\nd3 r\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb A\u03bc \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb . (D4)\nSeff [A] = (1/4\u03c0)\ni\n\nD\n\nComparing this result to Eq. \u0303(23), we conclude that the\nconstraint on the coupling\nPconstants Qi is the same as in\nthe edge theory, namely i \u03c3i Q2i = \u03bd.\n\n\f19\nAction (D2) appears in the context of topological theory, where excitations are given by Wilson lines.49 For\ninstance, a general local excitation at the point r may be\nwritten as:\n\u0011\n\u0010 X Zr\nqj dr\u03bc bj\u03bc .\n\u03c8q (r) = exp i\nj\n\nthe boundary fields:\n\u03c6i (x, t) =\n\nhiZ(x,t)\n\n(D5)\n\nThe statistical phase of two excitations of type (D5) is\ngiven by braiding of the corresponding Wilson lines.49\nConsidering two excitations labeled with q1j and q2j\nwe arrive, after a simple calculation of braiding, at the\nfollowing\nexpression for the statistical phase: \u03b812 =\nP\n\u03c0 i \u03c3j q1j q2j . It is important that this expression coincides with the one for the edge excitations. Moreover,\nif we define the charge operatorR as an integral over a\n\u03bd \u03bb\nspace-like plane Qem = (Qi /2\u03c0) d2 r\u01ebP\n\u03bd\u03bb \u2202 bi , then the\ncharge of the excitation (D5) is Qem = i \u03c3i Qi qi , i.e., it\ntakes the same form as in the edge theory.\nThe coincidence of bulk and edge expressions for\ncharges and statistical phases of excitations illustrates\nthe holographic principle at work in QH systems. Indeed,\nit is easy to see that the whole classification of effective\nmodels at the edge applies also to the bulk. Furthermore, Fr\u00f6hlich and Pedrini55 proposed an exact mapping\nbetween edge and bulk models, assuming that the edge\nexcitations originate from incompressible deformations of\nQH liquids. Below we summarize the main steps of this\nconstruction.\n\nTheP\nkey idea\u0001 is to represent the insertion of an operator\nexp i j qj \u03c6j at the edge as insertion of a Wilson line\n(D5) of the bulk theory by placing the end point r at the\nboundary and r0 in the Ohmic contact. To realize this\nidea we choose a particular Wilson line shown in Fig. 11.\nParametrizing incompressible deformations of QH liquids\nby the set of functions y = hi (x, t), one may introduce\n\nZx\n\ndx\u2032 bix (x\u2032 , y0 , t), (D6)\n\nx0\n\nwhere y = y0 is the auxiliary boundary and x0 is the\ncoordinate of the Ohmic contact.\nIntegrating out the bulk fields bi\u03bc , we find that56\nbi\u03bc = \u03c3i Qi A\u03bc .\n\n(D7)\n\nTaking the derivative of Eq. (D6) with respect\nto x, one obtains \u03c3i \u2202x \u03c6i = Qi Ay (x, hi , t)\u2202x hi +\nRh\nQi y0i dy \u2032 \u2202x Ay (x, y \u2032 , t) + Qi Ax (x, y0 , t). In the lowenergy limit we may neglect the term proportional to\n\u2202x hi . Then, taking into account that the magnetic field\n2\nis constant \u2202x Ay \u2212\u2202y Ax = 1/lB\n, we relate the derivatives\n\u2202x \u03c6i to the edge densities57 \u03c1i (x, t) = \u03c3i Q2i [hi (x, t) \u2212\n2\ny0 ]/2\u03c0lB\n:\n\u03c1i (x, t) =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nQi \u2202x \u03c6i + \u03c3i Q2i Ax (x, hi , t) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(D8)\n\nThis expression for the charge densities of the edge channels coincides with the one derived from action (22), provided we further assume that hi is small in the low-energy\nlimit and replace Ax (x, hi , t) \u2192 Ax (x, y0 , t). In other\nwords, we assume linear coupling to the electromagnetic\nfield.\nRh\nThe continuity equations \u03c1 \u0307i +\u2202x y0i jix = jiy , after the\nsubstitution of Eq.

The\nvelocities of edge modes in the above analysis are zero,\nbecause we have not taken into account the confining\npotential and the interaction effects at the edge.\nIt is important to note that the bulk-edge correspondence described above does not always hold. For instance, compressible strips may be present at the edge.14\nIn this case, the edge theory will contain more fields than\nthe bulk theory. Nevertheless, bulk excitations should be\nalways present in the edge spectrum. In the present work\nwe only consider minimal models of the edge, for the following reasons. First of all, in the case when the number\n\n\f20\nof chiral fields at the edge is large, scaling dimensions\nof extra electrons associated with these fields are usually\nlarge,8 i.e., these excitations are not observable in the\nlow-energy limit. Second, non-chiral models with additional fields are likely to be unstable against disorder.15\nHowever, the possible relevance of models with a large\nnumber of channels deserves a separate, detailed analysis.\nAPPENDIX E: MATHEMATICAL ASPECTS OF\nTHE THEORY OF QH LATTICES\n\nIn this section we wish to briefly describe the QH lattice construction proposed in Refs. [8,55]. This construction is a mathematical reformulation of physical requirements for the effective theory of a QH system discussed\nin Secs. II and III. It provides a method, based on using invariants of lattices, to classify physically allowed\nlow-energy effective models of QH edge states. The main\nphysical consequences of the lattice construction include\na determination of the minimal charge of quasi-particle,\nof the minimal number of edge channels, for given filling\nfactor, etc. Here we summarize the lattice construction\nand present the results without proof.\nFirst, we recall that action (22) of the effective theory\nis parameterized by the vector of coupling constants, Qi ,\nintroduced in Sec. III. Local\nare represented\n\u0001\nP excitations\nby vertex operators, exp i j qj \u03c6j , and labeled by vectors q = {qi }; so the sum of two such vectors corresponds\nto the product of operators. Defining the scalar product:\nX\nai bi \u03c3i ,\n(E1)\nha, bi =\ni\n\nwhere \u03c3i is the chirality of ith channel, we represent the\nelectric charge (27) of an excitation corresponding to the\nvector q and the statistical phase (26) of two excitations\ncorresponding to q1 and q2 as\nQem = hQ, qi,\n\n\u03b812 = \u03c0hq1 , q2 i,\n\n(E2)\n\nrespectively.\nAs discussed in Sec. III, after fixing the coupling constants Qi (i.e. fixing the action), we have to choose electronic excitations. We denote them with q\u03b1 . Multielectron excitations form an integral lattice \u0393:\n\u0393 = {k\u03b1 q\u03b1 |k\u03b1 \u2208 Z}.\n\n(E3)\n\nIt has been mentioned in Sec. III B that choosing some\ndifferent sets of elementary electronic excitations is equivalent to choosing different bases in the same lattice \u0393.\nThus, the lattice \u0393 describes an effective theory in a\nbasis-independent way. The condition that the electric\ncharge hQ, qi of any combination of electrons q \u2208 \u0393 is\ninteger implies that the vector of couplings Q belongs to\nthe dual lattice \u0393\u2217 . Thus, by choosing the lattice \u0393 and\na vector Q of its dual, one selects a particular effective\nmodel.\n\nNext, important physical constraints on the effective\nmodels discussed in Sec. II can be formulated as following:\n\u2022 The condition of anomaly cancellation, for a given\nfilling fraction \u03bd, implies that hQ, Qi = \u03bd.\n\u2022 The correct charge of electronic operators is guaranteed if the greatest common divisor of the coordinates of Q in \u0393\u2217 is equal to 1, because this divisor\nis equal to the minimal value of hQ, qi for q \u2208 \u0393.\n\u2022 The correct statistical phase of electronic excitations is a consequence of the condition hQ, qi \u2261\nhq, qi (mod 2), \u2200q \u2208 \u0393.\nThe spectrum of allowed local excitations follows from\nthe requirement that the wave function of the QH\nstate is\nin the presence of an excitation\n\u0001\nP single-valued\nexp i j pj \u03c6j . We mentioned in Sec. II that this condition is equivalent to having integer relative statistical\nphases between electrons and quasi-particles:\nhp, q\u03b1 i \u2208 Z.\n\n(E4)\n\nThus, the lattice of allowed excitations is \u0393\u2217 \u2287 \u0393. As\nwe have shown in Sec. III, the scaling dimension, \u2206, of\nthe correlation function of the excitation p does not depend on the Hamiltonian in a purely chiral theory. It is\nequal to the statistical phase \u2206 = hp, pi. So, for purely\nchiral models, the pair (\u0393, Q) provides complete information about the effective theory. In order to do explicit\ncalculations, one needs to introduce a particular basis\nfor \u0393. It is, however, not trivial to verify whether two\ndifferent bases generate the same lattice. To distinguish\neffective models and, therefore, classify them, one needs\nbasis-independent information about lattices. Such information is provided by lattice invariants.\nTo classify the pairs (\u0393, Q) satisfying the conditions\ndiscussed above, we introduce most important lattice invariants. Obvious invariants are the filling factor \u03bd =\nnH /dH , with nH and dH as coprime integers, and the\ndimension (or rank) of the lattice N = dim \u0393. One may\nshow that, for any basis, {e\u03b1 }, of \u0393, the determinant of\nthe Gram matrix \u2206\u0393 = dethe\u03b1 , e\u03b2 i is also an invariant.58\nAn interesting property of this determinant is the factorization \u2206\u0393 = ldH , where l is an integer number called\nlevel. Moreover, one may show that, for any basis {e\u03b1 }\nof \u0393\u2217 , the greatest common divisor g = gcd(Q1 , . . . , QN )\nof the numbers Q\u03b1 = \u2206\u0393 hQ, e\u03b1 i is an invariant, and\nthat l = \u03bbg, where \u03bb is an integer. This number \u03bb is an\nimportant parameter often called the charge parameter.\nIt determines the minimal possible electric charge of a\nquasi-particle:\ne\u2217 =\n\nmin\n\np\u2208\u0393\u2217 ,hQ,pi6=0\n\n|hQ, pi| =\n\n1\n.\n\u03bbdH\n\n(E5)\n\nFinally, one introduces two further invariants, called\nminimal and maximal relative angular momenta. The\n\n\f21\nminimal relative angular momentum is defined as\nlmin =\n\nmin\n\nhq, qi.\n\nq\u2208\u0393,hQ,qi=1\n\n(E6)\n\nIntroducing the set, BQ , of all possible electronic bases,\n{q\u03b1 }, of \u0393, for a given Q (i.e., such that \u2200\u03b1 : hQ, q\u03b1 i =\n1), one defines the maximal relative angular momentum\nas\n\u0010\n\u0011\nmaxhq\u03b1 , q\u03b1 i .\n(E7)\nlmax = min\n{q\u03b1 }\u2208BQ\n\n\u03b1\n\nThe invariants lmin and lmax cannot take arbitrary values. For instance, in purely chiral models, they are constrained by the inequality 1/\u03bd \u2264 lmin \u2264 lmax .\nThe simplest examples of such lattice construction\nappear in the case of dimension N = 1. For onedimensional lattices, there is only one independent invariant lmax = lmin = \u2206\u0393 = m, where m is an odd\ninteger. This number is nothing but\n\u221a the statistical phase\nof an electron, therefore Q = 1/ m and the filling factor \u03bd = 1/m. Moreover, it is easy to see that the level\nl = \u2206\u0393 /dH = 1, hence the charge parameter \u03bb = 1, and\nwe find that the minimal electric charge is e\u2217 = 1/m. We\nconclude that the QH lattices\n\u221a\n\u0393m = {n me|n \u2208 Z}\n(E8)\n\u221a\nwith coupling Qm = e/ m and \u03bd = 1/m are the only\nones allowed for N = 1.\nFor the two-field case, N = 2, the construction of allowed lattices is more complex. From the definition of\nrelative angular momenta it follows that we may choose\nelectronic bases with a Gram matrix of the following\nform:\n!\nlmin b\nK=\n.\n(E9)\nb lmax\nWe consider lattices with lmax < 7, which are physically\nmost relevant.43 Then one may simply list all models by\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect, edited by R.E.

Rev.\n\ngoing through all possible values of lmax , lmin and b.8 Furthermore, we limit our attention to the case lmin = lmax ,\nwhich is most important in the context of our paper.\n\u221aFor convenience, we choose coordinates such that Q =\n( \u03bd, 0). The condition of unit charge, hQ, q\u03b1 i = 1, for\n\u03b1 = 1, 2, partially fixes the form of electron\n\u221a vectors, q\u03b1 ,\n\u03bd, s) and q2 =\nin these\ncoordinates.\nNamely,\nq\n=\n(1/\n1\n\u221a\n(1/ \u03bd, \u2212s), where the number s is yet to be determined.\nIt follows from the requirement |q1 |2 = |q2 |2 = lmax that\ns2 = lmax \u2212 1/\u03bd. The mutual statistical phase of two\nelectrons, \u03b812 = \u03c0(1/\u03bd \u2212 s2 ), should be an integer. This\nimplies that lmax + \u03b812 /\u03c0 = 2/\u03bd is an integer number.\nThus we see that the special case lmin = lmax corresponds\nto \u03bd = 2/m where m is an integer. Note that, for lmax <\n7, the converse statement is also true, i.e., for \u03bd = 2/m,\nall the two dimensional lattices have lmin = lmax .\nAfter some elementary calculations, we find that, for\n\u03bd = 2/m, Gram matrix (E9) may be expressed as:\n!\nlmax lmax \u2212 l\nK=\n.\n(E10)\nlmax \u2212 l lmax\nFrom condition (32), applied to Eq. (E10), we find that\nthe level l = 2lmax \u2212 m = 2s2 . Therefore, all the lattices\nin the case \u03bd = 2/m can be parameterized by only two\nnumbers, m and l. It is important to observe that, for\nall these lattices, \u03bb = 1. Hence, for two-field models\nwith \u03bd = 2/m, the minimal charge is always e\u2217 = 1/m.\nIntroducing\nof orthogonal vectors, e1,2 , so that\np a pair p\nq1,2 = m/2e1 \u00b1 l/2e2 , the lattices may be written\nexplicitly as\np\n\u0393ml = { m/2(n1 + n2 )e1\np\n+ l/2(n1 \u2212 n2 )e2 |n1,2 \u2208 Z}, (E11)\n\np\nand the couplings Qml = 2/m e1 . Finally, we stress\nthat K-matrices (51) and (52) proposed in Sec. IV are\nexactly the Gram matrices (E10) for the particular case\n\u03bd = 2/3.\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nD 72 085011 (2005).\nX.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. B 41, 12838 (1990).\nJ.
