Following the seminal experimental observation of\nBose Einstein condensation, simulating many-body quantum phenomena using\ncold atoms, which in a limited sense realizes Feynman's dream of quantum simulation, has emerged as an active frontier at the cross section of AMO and condensed matter physics. There is hope and excitement that these highly tailored\nand well controlled systems may solve some of the mysteries regarding strongly\ncorrelated electrons, and pave ways for the development of quantum computers.\nThe subject of this chapter is motivated by recent breakthroughs in creating\n\"artificial gauge fields\" that couple to neural atoms in an analogous way that electromagnetic fields couple to charged particles [1]. This opens up the possibility of\nstudying quantum Hall (QH) states and its close cousin quantum spin Hall (QSH)\nstates, which belong to the family of exotic states of matter known as Topological\nInsulators.\nQH and QSH effect usually requires magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling,\nrespectively. In contrast to electrons in solids, cold atoms are charge neutral and\ninteract with external electromagnetic field primarily via atom-light coupling. Artificial orbital magnetic field can be achieved by rotating the gas [9]. In the rotating frame, the dynamics of atoms becomes equivalent to charged particles in a\nmagnetic field which is proportional to the rotation frequency. To enter the quantum Hall regime using this approach requires exceedingly fast rotation, a task up\nto now remains a technical challenge. In this regard, another approach to engineer artificial magnetic field offers advantages. This involves engineering the\n(Berry's) geometric phase of atoms by properly arranging inhomogeneous laser\nfields that modify the eigenstates (the dressed states) via atom-light coupling [10].\nSuch geometric phase can mimic for example the Aharonov-Bohm phase of orbital magnetic field. Because the dressed states can be manipulated on scales of\nthe wavelength of light, the artificial gauge fields can be made very strong. For\nexample, the phase acquired by going around the lattice unit cell can approach the\norder of \u03c0. This gives hope to enter the quantum Hall regime. The strength of this\napproach also lies in its versatility. Artificial gauge fields in a multitude of forms,\neither Abelian (including both electric and magnetic field) or non-Abelian (including effective spin-orbit coupling), can be introduced for continuum gases or atoms\nin optical lattices [10]. Recent NIST experiments have successfully demonstrated\nartificial magnetic field [1] as well as spin-orbit coupling [2] for bosonic Rb atoms\nand experiments are underway to reach QH and QSH regimes.\n\n2\n\n\fE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nFigure 1: Figure illustrates distinction between ordinary band insulator (left),\nQH (middle) and QSH (right) insulators in the energy spectrum. Connecting the\nconduction and valence bands are the edge states.\n\nTopological aspects: Chern numbers and edged states\nTopological insulators (TI) are unconventional states of matter [3] that are insulating in the bulk but conduct along the boundaries. A more general working\ndefinition of TI, applicable to the case of neutral atoms, is that they are band insulators with a bulk gap but robust gapless boundary (edge or surface) modes (\nFig. 1 ). These boundary modes are protected against small deformations in the\nsystem parameters, as long as generic symmetries such as time-reversal or chargeconjugation are preserved and the bulk gap is not closed. Such states arise even in\nsystems of non-interacting fermions and are considerably simpler than topological\nstates of strongly interacting electrons, such as the fractional QH effect. Despite\nsuch deceiving simplicity, as we will show in this chapter, the subject is very rich\nand rather intricate, with plenty of open questions.\nWe will consider two prime examples of TIs in two dimension, the QH and\nQSH states. A topological insulator is not characterized by any local order parameter, but by a topological number that captures the global structures of the\nwave functions. For example, associated with each integer quantum Hall state is\nan integer number, the Chern number . The Chern number also coincides with\nthe quantized Hall conductance (in unit of e2 /~) of the integer QH state. The\nquantization of the Hall conductance is extremely robust, and has been measured\nto one part in 109 [11]. Such precision is a manifestation of the topological nature of quantum Hall states. A quantum Hall state is accompanied by chiral edge\nmodes, that propagate along the edge along one direction and their number equals\nthe Chern number. Semi-classically, these edge states can be visualized as result3\n\n\fing from the skipping orbits of electrons bouncing off the edge while undergoing\ncyclotron motion in external magnetic field. The edge states are insensitive to disorder because there are no states available for backscattering, a fact that underlies\nthe perfectly quantized electronic transport in the QHE. This well known example demonstrates the \"bulk-boundary correspondence\", a common theme for all\ntopological insulators.\nThe QSH state is time-reversal invariant [13]. It is characterized by a binary\nZ2 topological invariant \u03bd = 1. The edge modes in this case come in the form\nof Kramers pairs, with one set of modes being the time-reversal of the other set.\nIn the simplest example, spin up electron and spin down electron travel in opposite direction along the edge. A topologically nontrivial state with \u03bd = 1 has\nodd number of Kramers pairs at its edge. Topologically trivial states have \u03bd = 0,\nand even number of Kramers pairs, the edge states in this case are not topological\nstable. This is another manifestation of the \"bulk-boundary correspondence\". Recent theoretical research has achieved a fairly complete classification, or \"periodic\ntable\", for all possible topological band insulators and topological superconductors/superfluids in any spatial dimensions [4\u20136]. Several authoritative reviews of\nthis rapidly evolving field now exist [3,7,8], which also cover the fascinating subject of how to describe TIs using low energy effective field theory with topological\n(e.g., Chern-Simons or \u03b8-) terms.\nIn cold atom systems, transport measurement such as Hall conductance is difficult. Also, the existence of an overall trap potential instead of a sharp edge for\na solid state sample, as well as the lack of a precision local probe such as STM,\nmakes it hard to probe the edge states. Therefore, identifying topological state\nsuch as a QH state and extract the Chern number remains a challenging task. Here\nwe show that Chern numbers are \"hiding\" in time of flight images of the cold atom\nsystems, a routine measurement in cold atom experiments.\n\nThe Hofstadter model and the Chern number\nFor a moderately deep square optical lattice, the dynamics of (spinless) fermionic\natoms in the presence of an artificial magnetic field is described by the tight binding Hamiltonian known as the Hofstadter model [14],\nX \u2020\nH=\u2212\ntx cn+1,m ei\u03b8n+1,m:n,m cn,m + ty c\u2020n,m+1 ei\u03b8n,m+1:n,m cn,m + h.c.

The anisotropy in hopping is described\nby dimensionless parameter \u03bb = ty /tx . The phase factor \u03b8n,m:n0 ,m0 is given the\n0\n0\nline integral\nR of the vector potential A along the link from site (n , m ) to (n, m),\n(2\u03c0e/ch) A * dl. The magnetic flux per plaquete measured in flux quantum is\nlabeled \u03b1, and represents the strength of magnetic field perpendicular to the 2D\nplane. The energy spectra for \u03bb = 1, 2 are shown in Fig. 2. At commensurate\nflux, i.e., \u03b1 is a rational number \u03b1 = p/q with p and q being integers, the original\nenergy band splits into q sub-bands by the presence of magnetic field, and the\nspectrum has q \u22121 gaps. For incommensurate flux, namely when \u03b1 is an irrational\nnumber, the fractal spectrum contains a hierarchy of sub-bands with infinite fine\nstructures. As shown in Fig. 2, varying anisotropy changes the size of the gaps\nwithout closing any gap.\nIn the Landau gauge, the vector potential Ax = 0 and Ay = \u2212\u03b1x and the\nunit cell is of size q and the magnetic Brillouin zone is \u2212\u03c0/q \u2264 kx \u2264 \u03c0/q and\n\u2212\u03c0 \u2264 ky \u2264 \u03c0 (the lattice spacing is set to be 1). The eigenstates of the system can\nbe written as \u03a8n,m = eikx n+iky m \u03c8n where \u03c8n satisfies the Harper equation [14],\nr\nr\neikx \u03c8n+1\n+ e\u2212ikx \u03c8n\u22121\n+ 2\u03bb cos(2\u03c0n\u03b1 + ky )\u03c8nr = \u2212E\u03c8nr .\n\n(2)\n\nr\nHere \u03c8n+q\n= \u03c8nr , r = 1, 2, ...q, labels linearly independent solutions.

Figure on\nthe right shows the two point correlation function C(l) that vanishes unless l = 4\nresulting in almost sinusoidal momentum distribution with period 4.\nequation (2). For chemical potentials inside each energy gap, the system is in an\ninteger quantum Hall state characterized by its Chern number cr and the transverse\nconductivity \u03c3xy = cr e2 /h, where the Chern number of r-filled bands is given by,\ncr = Im\n\nl Z\nX\n\ndkx dky\n\nr=1\n\nq\nX\n\n\u2202kx (\u03c8nr )\u2217 \u2202ky \u03c8nr .\n\n(3)\n\nn=1\n\nHere the integration over kx , ky is over the magnetic Brillouin zone.\n\nChern-Dimer mapping for anisotropic lattices\nAs illustrated in Fig. (2), the hopping anisotropy changes the size of the gaps,\nwithout ever closing the gap. Hence the topological aspects of the underlying\nstates are preserved, as \u03bb is continuously tuned. In the limit \u03bb \u001d 1, the problems\nbecomes tractable using degenerate perturbation theory [15]. For \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, the q\n6\n\n\fbands have dispersion Er (ky ) = \u22122ty cos(2\u03c0\u03b1r + ky ), r \u2208 {1, . . . , q}. These\neigenstates are extended along y but localized to single sites as a function of x,\nwith wave function \u03c8nr = \u03b4n,r . These cosine bands shifted from each other intersect at numerous degeneracy points ky\u2217 . For finite \u03bb, the hopping term proportional\nto tx hybridizes the two states at each crossing, resulting an avoided crossing as\nshown in Fig (4). Near each degeneracy point the system is well described by a\ntwo-level effective Hamiltonian [15],\nH(k) = \u2206` [cos(kx `)\u03c3x + sin(kx `)\u03c3y ] + v` (ky \u2212 ky\u2217 )\u03c3z .\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03c3x,y,z are the Pauli matrices in the space of localized states |ri and |r0 i,\nand ` = r0 \u2212 r is the spatial separation between these two localized states. The\nexpression for \u2206` and v` are given in Ref. [16]. The eigenstates are equal-weight\nsuperpositions of |ri and |r0 i,\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c8n\u00b1 = \u221a \u03b4n,r + ei\u03b2\u00b1 \u03b4n,r0 ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b2+ = \u2212`(kx + \u03c0) + \u03c0 and \u03b2\u2212 = \u2212`(kx + \u03c0) are relative phases for the\nupper and lower band edges, respectively. We call such dimerized state \"Cherndimers\". Starting from Eq. (5), it is straightforward to show [15] that the corresponding Chern number is related to the phase factor eikx ` , and simply given\nby cr = `. Thus, for sufficiently anisotropic hopping, dimerized states form at\nthe band edges with its spatial extent along x equal to the Chern number of the\ncorresponding gap. Such one-to-one correspondence between the Chern number\nand the size of the real space dimer (in the Landau gauge) will be referred to as\n\"Chern-dimer mapping\". While calculation of Chern number in this limit is not\nnew, this mapping has not been elucidated and emphasized until our work [16].\nThe formation of Chern-dimers of size ` = cr at the edges of the r-th gap\nimplies a \"hidden spatial correlation\". The correlation function\nX\nC(l) =\nhc\u2020n,m cn+l,m i\n(6)\nn,m\n\nwill peak at l = ` = cr . For chemical potential in the r-th gap, as \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, ( Fig.\n4) C(l) asymptotes to a delta function C(l) \u2192 \u03b4(l \u2212 `), due to the contribution\nof Chern-dimers at the lower edge of the r-th gap. Note that the net contribution\nto C(l) from all other dimerized states associated with gaps fully below the Fermi\nenergy is zero, because \u03b2+ \u2212 \u03b2\u2212 = \u03c0 for each of these crossings. Remarkably,\n7\n\n\fC(l), or more precisely its Fourier transform n(kx ), is directly accessible in the\ntime-of-flight (TOF) image, an routine observable in cold atom experiments,\nIn the time-of-flight experiments, the artificial gauge field is first turned off\nabruptly. This introduces an impulse of effective electric field that converts the\ncanonical momentum of atoms (when gauge field was on) into the mechanical\nmomentum (these subtleties are discussed in [16]). Then the optical lattice and\ntrap potential are turned off, the density of the atomic cloud n(x) is imaged after a period of free expansion tTOF . The image is a direct measurement of the\n(mechanical) momentum distribution function with k = mx/~tTOF ,\nX\n0\nn(k) =\nhc\u2020r cr0 ieik*(r\u2212r ) ,\n(7)\nr,r0\n\nwhere the site label r = mx\u0302 + n\u0177, and for simplicity we neglect the overall\nprefactor and the Wannier function envelope. Thus, from TOF images, the 1D\nmomentum\ndistribution can be constructed by integrating n(k) over ky , n(kx ) =\nR\u03c0\ndky n(k), which is nothing but the Fourier transform of C(l). Thus, in the\n\u2212\u03c0\nlimit of large \u03bb, C(l) becomes a delta function, and the 1D momentum distribution\nfunction becomes\n1\n(8)\nn(kx ) = r \u00b1 cos(cr kx ) + ...\n2\nIt assumes a sinusoidal form, with oscillation period given by the Chern number.\nNote the sign depends on which gap the chemical potential lies in [16], and the offset r comes from the contribution from the filled bands below the Fermi energy.\nIn summary, we have arrived at the conclusion that Chern numbers can be simply\nread off from n(kx ) as measured in TOF, in the large anisotropy limit.\n\nChern number in time-of-flight images\nWe now address the question whether it is still possible to extract cr from TOF\nwhen away from the large \u03bb limit. Note that, while the Chern number does not\nchange inside the same gap as \u03bb is tuned, n(kx ) is not topologically invariant.\nThere is a prior no reason to expect Chern number continues to leave its fingerprints in n(kx ). Motivated by these considerations, we have carried out detailed\nnumerical studies of momentum distribution in the entire \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb parameter plane,\ngoing well beyond the \"Chern-dimer regime\". Fig. (4) highlights our results\nwith various \u03bb but fixed \u03b1 and Chern number. As \u03bb is reduced, n(kx ) gradually\ndeviates from the sinusoidal distribution. Yet, the local maxima (peaks) persist.\n8\n\n\fIn the limit of isotropic lattice, n(kx ) shows pronounced local peaks. For a wide\nregion of parameters, we can summarize our finding into an empirical rule: the\nnumber of local peaks in n(kx ) within the first Brillouin zone is equal to the Chern\nnumber. Note that this rule is not always precise, as seen in the Fig. (4) for the\ncase of Chern number 3 for intermediate values of \u03bb where local peaks become a\nbroad shoulder-like structure. Despite this, it is valid in extended regions including both large \u03bb and \u03bb = 1. In fact, given the reasoning above, our empirical rule\nseems to work surprisingly well. But this is an encouraging result for cold atoms\nexperiments. From these distinctive features in n(kx ), the Chern number can be\ndetermined rather easily by counting the peaks, especially for the major gaps with\nlow Chern number.\nThe Chern-dimer mapping provides a simple, intuitive understanding of n(kx )\nin the limit of large \u03bb. For the isotropic case, there is no dimerization, why are\nthere pronounced peaks in n(kx ), and why is the peak number precisely equal to\nthe Chern number? To obtain further insight, we considered the low flux limit,\n\u03b1 \u2192 0, where the size of the cyclotron orbit is large compared to the lattice\nspacing, and the system approaches the continuum limit. The spectrum then can\nbe approximated by discrete Landau levels. For r filled Landau levels, n(kx ) can\nbe obtained rather easily,\nn(kx ) =\n\nr\u22121\nX\n\n2\n\n(2\u03bd \u03bd!)\u22121 H\u03bd2 (kx )e\u2212kx ,\n\n(9)\n\n\u03bd=0\n\nwhere H\np\u03bd is the Hermite polynomial, and kx is measured in the inverse magnetic\nlength eB/~c. n(kx ) is given by the weighted sum of consecutive positivedefinite function, H\u03bd2 (kx ). The node structure of H\u03bd is such that n(kx ) has exactly\nr local maxima (peaks) for r filled Landau levels. This nicely explains the numerical results for the Hofstadter model at low (but finite) flux \u03b1 = 1/q, where the\nChern number cr = r in the r-th gap, and n(kx ) has precisely r peaks (see Fig. 5).\nNote that this calculation does not directly explain the feature shown in Fig. 4 for\n\u03b1 = 0.45 and \u03bb = 1. As \u03b1 increases, for \u03bc residing within the same energy gap,\nthe distinctive features of n(kx ) are generally retained, so the counting rule is still\nvalid. Compared to the low flux regime, however, the local peaks (except the one\nat kx = 0) move to higher momenta.\n\n9\n\n\f6\n2\n\n1.5\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFigure 4: Momentum distribution as anisotropy parameter varies from 1 \u2212 10,\nfor \u03b1 = .45 for chern numbers 1 (top-left), 2 (top-right), 3 (bottom-left), and 4\n(bottom-right).\n\n10\n\n\f0\n\n60\n\n-1\n\n45\n\n30\n\n\u03bc\n\n30\n\n-2\n\nn(kx)\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n-3\n0\n-3 -2 -1\n\n0\nkx\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nkx\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 5: Left: n(kx , \u03bc) in false color for a 50 \u00d7 50 lattice with isotropic hopping\nand flux \u03b1 = 0.05.

The corresponding Chern number is 1, 2, 3, 4,\nand 5.\n\nIncommensurate flux: Chern tree\nMonday, October 31, 2011\n\nWhile it is numerically straightforward to investigate the n(kx ) or \u03c3xy for QHE\nat incommensurate flux \u03b1, analytical analysis of the Chern number for this case\nrepresents a conceptual as well as a technical challenge. In fact, for irrational\n\u03b1, the system no longer has translational symmetry, and the notion of magnetic\nBrillouin zone or Bloch wave function lose their meaning. The incommensurability acts like correlated disorder. The TKNN formula for a periodic system is\nnot directly applicable. In addition, the energy spectrum becomes infinitely fragmented (a Cantor set). One expects then a dense distribution of Chern numbers\neven within a small window of energy. Then two questions arise. First, will these\nChern numbers largely random or are there deterministic patterns governing their\nsequence as \u03bc is continuously varied? Second, what is the experimental outcome\nof n(kx ) or \u03c3xy when measured with a finite energy resolution?\nWe address some of these questions\nhere for the isotropic lattice (\u03bb = 1) us\u221a\ning the golden-mean flux, \u03b1 = ( 5 \u2212 1)/2, as an example. We will employ a\nwell known trick, and approach the irrational limit by a series of rational approximation \u03b1n = Fn /Fn+1 , where Fn is the n-th Fibonacci numbers. Explicitly, the\nseries 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 13/21, 21/34, 34/55, 55/89... approaches the golden-mean\n\n11\n\n\fwith increasing accuracy. At each stage of the rational approximation, the energy\nspectrum and the corresponding sequence of Chern numbers can be determined.\nHigher Chern numbers are typically associated to smaller gaps in the asymptotically fractal spectrum. At first sight, the Chern number associated with the r-th\ngap seems an irregular function of r as shown in Fig. (6) for \u03b1 = 34/55. This is\nin sharp contrast with the case of \u03b1 = 1/q, where cr = r for the r-th gap.\nNow we show analytically that there actually exists a deterministic pattern\nunderlying the sequence of Chern numbers. This pattern follows from the solutions of the Diophantine equation (DE) [12], r = cr p + sr q, where r is the\ngap index, cr is the Chern number, at each level of the rational approximation,\np = Fn , q = Fn+1 . We first classify all the Chern numbers into two classes, the Fibonacci Chern numbers and the non-Fibonacci Chern numbers. All the solutions\nto the DE, which determine the Chern number, can be exhausted by following two\nsimple rules, labeled as I, II and explicitly stated below.\n(I) Fibonacci Chern numbers occur at gaps labeled by a Fibonacci index\nr = Fm : for \u03b1 = Fn\u22121 /Fn , cr=Fm = \u2212(\u22121)n\u2212m Fn\u2212m . Here r = 1 corresponds\nto the first gap near the band edge with Chern number Fn\u22122 = (\u22121)nf (q \u2212 p),\nwhile the last Fibonacci gap near the band center has a Chern number (\u22121)nf\nwhere nf counts the number of Fibonacci numbers less than |q/2|. The Fibonacci\nChern numbers increases monotonically in magnitude as one moves from the center towards the edge of the band (see Fig. 6).\n(II) The rest are the non-Fibonacci Chern numbers. The Chern number for the\nr-th gap and its neighboring gaps (r \u00b1 1) obey the recursion relation,\ncr = (cr+1 + cr\u22121 )/2,\ncr+1 = cr + (\u22121)nf (q \u2212 p),\ncr\u22121 = cr \u2212 (\u22121)nf (q \u2212 p),\nFollowing these rules, we can construct an exhaustive list of all Chern numbers at each level of rational approximation. We have numerically checked that\nthe Chern numbers computed from the TKNN formula are consistent with the predictions from the DE above. This procedure yields a hierarchy of Chern numbers,\nwhich can be neatly organized into a tree structure, thanks to the recursion relation\nabove. A subset of this tree hierarchy is shown in Fig. 6. Most notably, we find\nthe average of the left and right neighboring Chern number is exactly the Chern\nnumber in the middle.\nThis property helps to understand the measurement outcomes of real experiments, which inevitably involves average of states with energy very close to each\n12\n\n\f30\n\n20\n\ncr\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n-1\n-6\n\n! = 3/5\n\n-1+5\n\n-1-5\n\n4\n8/13\n\n-6-8\n\n-6+21\n\n7\n\n-1+8\n\n-6-21\n\n-1+21\n7+21\n\n15\n\n-1-8\n\n-27\n\n7-21\n\n-14 20\n\n-9\n\n4+8\n\n-1-21\n\n4+21\n-9+21\n\n4-21\n\n13/21\n\n-9-21\n\n-22 12\n\n25\n\n-17\n\n34/55\n\nTuesday, November 1, 2011\n\nFigure 6: The Chern tree at golden-mean flux showing four consecutive rational\napproximations: \u03b1 = 3/5, 8/13, 13/21, 34/55 starting with Chern number \u22121.\nThe horizontal axis is not to scale and only shows the correct order of Chern\nnumbers.

In the context of cold atoms, due to the overall trap potential, the local\nchemical potential slowly varies in space. These local contributions sum up in\nTOF images according to the local density approximation. The self-averaging\nproperty to some degree ensures that such average yields definite result, and the\ninfinitely fine details in the energy spectrum are largely irrelevant. This aspect is\nillustrated in Fig. 6 for the Chern tree shown in Fig. 6. The momentum distribution n(kx ) in the average sense for \u03b1 = 3/5, 8/13, 13/21, 34/55 will be essentially\nthe same.\nSimilar consideration applies to \u03c3xy . One may see a robust plateau, which\nmay not be perfectly quantized, in a region of chemical potential due to the selfaveraging. We have numerically computed \u03c3xy using the Landauer-Buttiker formalism [18] for a mesoscopic quantum Hall bar (inset of Fig. 7) at golden-mean\nflux and connected to four semi-infinite leads. The transmission coefficients Tij\nare obtained by solving for the Green's function of the sample and the level width\nfunctions of each leads. The transverse conductivity at golden-mean flux is shown\nin Fig. 7. One clearly sees a conductance plateau with cr = 4, in addition to\ncr = 1, 2, 3.\n\n14\n\n\fQuantum spin Hall effect for ultracold atoms\nIn solid state, the QSH effect is closely related to spin-orbit coupling. In a recent\nstudy [17], it was shown that the effect of spin-orbit coupling can be achieved for\ncold atoms by creating SU (2) artificial gauge fields.\nThe theoretical model that captures the essential properties of this system is\ngiven by a Hamiltonian describing fermions hopping on a square lattice in the\npresence of a SU(2) gauge field\nX \u2020\nH = \u2212t\ncm+1,n ei\u03b8x cm,n + c\u2020m,n+1 ei\u03b8y cm,n + h.c. + \u03bbstag (\u22121)m c\u2020m,n cm,n (10)\nmn\n\nwhere cm,n is the 2-component field operator defined on a lattice site (m, n), and\n\u03bbstag is the onsite staggered potential along the x-axis. The phase factors \u03b8m,n\ncorresponding to SU (2) gauge fields are chosen to be,\n\u03b8x = 2\u03c0\u03b3\u03c3x ,\n\u03b8y = 2\u03c0x\u03b1\u03c3z ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3x,z are Pauli matrices. The control parameter \u03b3 is a crossover parameter\nbetween QH and QSH states as \u03b3 = 0 describes uncoupled double QH systems\nwhile \u03b3 = \u03c0/2 corresponds to the two maximally coupled QH states. It should be\nnoted that the Hamiltonian (10) is invariant under time-reversal. The two components of the field operators correspond in general to a pseudo-spin 1/2, but could\nalso refer to the spin components of atoms, such as 6 Li, in a F = 1/2 ground\nstate hyperfine manifold. For \u03b3 = 0 case, spin is a good quantum number and\nthe system decouples into two subsystems which are respectively subjected to the\nmagnetic fluxes \u03b1 and \u2212\u03b1.\nFor isotropic lattices, this Multiband system has been found to exhibit [17] a\nseries of quantum phase transitions between QSH, normal insulator and metallic\nphases in two-dimensional parameter space for various values of chemical potential. Figure (9) shows the landscape of the phases near half-filling for \u03b1 = 1/6.\nThe transitions from topologically nontrivial quantum spin Hall (QSH) to topologically trivial normal band insulator is signaled by the disappearance of gapless\nKramer-pair of chiral edge modes.\nMotivated by the fact that anisotropic lattices, reveal a novel type of encoding\nof nontrivial topological states in the form of \"Chern-Dimers\", for U (1) gauge\nsystems, we present our preliminary results of QSH states for anisotropic lattices.\n15\n\n\fFigure 8: Shows the bulk (red) and surface spectrum (black) , near half-filling,\nfor \u03b1 = 1/6, \u03b3 = .25, \u03bb = 1 , and \u03bbstag = .5 ( left) and \u03bbstag = 1.5 ( right).\nThe presence of gapless edge modes for \u03bbstag = .5 and their absence for \u03bbstag =\n1.5 shows that these two respectively correspond to topologically non-trivial and\ntrivial phases.

In the bottom\ncaption, Green and blue show the local density of the two-component state at all\nsites. For normalized spinor wave function, a density of .25 shows the existence\nof a dimerized state for each component of the spinor.\n\n17\n\n\fAs shown in the Fig. 9, anisotropic lattices subjected to SU (2) gauge fields\nexhibit quantum phase transitions from QSH to normal insulating state by tuning\nthe staggered potential. In contrast to the QH system, the avoided crossings in\nQSH system need not be isolated as seen near ky = 1/3. However, there are\nstates, such as those near ky = 0 where one sees an isolated avoided crossing.\nOur preliminary investigation as summarized in figure (9) shows that for\nanisotropic lattices, in QSH phase, both components of the spinor wave function\nare dimerized near an isolated avoided crossings. It is the existence of this double\nor spinor-dimer that distinguishes QSH state from a normal insulator. In other\nwords, each component of the wave function of topologically non-trivial insulating phase localizes at two distinct sites, which is in contrast to the topologically\ntrivial phase, where the-components of the wave functions localize at a single site.\nFor normalized states, the existence of a double-dimer can be spotted by density\napproaching .25 as illustrated in the Fig. 9. The distinction between the QSH and\nnormal insulator, characterized by spinor-dimer and its absence suggests that such\ntopological phase transitions may be identified by time of flight images.\n\nOpen questions and outlook\nIdentifying topological states in time of flight images would be a dream measurement for cold atom experimentalists. Therefore, our result that the momentum\ndistribution carries fingerprints of nontrivial topology is important.\nOur studies raise several open questions regarding topological states and its\nmanifestations. Firstly, our detailed investigation suggests that the features of\ntopological invariant (Chern number) in momentum distribution are quite robust.\nIs there a rigorous theoretical framework that can establish this connection even\nfor parameters beyond Chern-dimer regime? Secondly, the sign of the Chern number can not be directly determined from the momentum distribution. It remains an\nopen question whether some other observable can detect its sign.\nAnother natural question is: how generic is the existence of dimerized states\nin topological states of matter? Somewhat analogous to edge states, the size of\nthe dimerized states in our example is a robust (topologically protected) quantity.\nFurthermore, are edge states and dimerized states related to each other? Naively,\none expects a dimer of size N in bulk will result in N -possible types of defects\nat open boundaries. These \"defects\" quite possibly will manifest as edge states\ninside the gap. It is conceivable that the topological aspect of the dimers of size\nN is intimately related to N -edge states in QH systems. Further work is required\n18\n\n\fto test these speculations, even in special cases.\nTo investigate the generality of the dimer framework in topological states, we\nhave studied QSH states for anisotropic lattices. Our preliminary studies suggest\nthat the topological phase transition from QSH to normal insulating state is accompanied by the absence of dimerized states and hence may be traceable in time\nof flight images. Detailed characterization of Z2 invariance within the framework\nof spatially extended objects, however remains appealing but open problem.\nThe subject of topological states of matter is an active frontier in physics.\nLessons learned from their realizations in ultracold atoms will help to advance\nthe fundamental understanding, and inspire new material design or technological\napplications. Ultracold topological superfluids, Mott insulators with nontrivial\ntopology, and non-equilibrium topological states are most likely to bear fruit in\nreasonably near future.\nWe thank Noah Bray-Ali, Nathan Goldman, Ian Spielman, and Carl Williams\nfor collaboration and their contributions during the course of this research.
