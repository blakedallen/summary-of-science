At the same time, deriving both results in perfect parallelity, our method\nreveals the nature of their close relation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this note, we wish to present a new and, for the first time, unified approach to two theorems\nwhich may be considered as the fundamental results, known by now, concerning the topological\ncentre problem for concrete Banach algebras studied in Abstract Harmonic Analysis. Namely, for\na period of nearly 15 years (beginning in the seventies with [Zap 75]), research in the topological\ncentre question was centered around the Banach algebras L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 , endowed with the first Arens\nproduct, and its quotient algebra LUC(G)\u2217 , where G denotes a locally compact group. \u2013 Here, we\nwrite LUC(G) for the space of complex-valued bounded left uniformly continuous functions on G;\nthe definition of the product on the dual LUC(G)\u2217 will be briefly recalled below. The questions\nwere eventually answered in full generality by the decisive work of Lau [Lau 86] and Lau\u2013Losert\n[Lau\u2013Los 88]. In the present note, we will derive both these results (see Theorems 1.1 and 1.2\nbelow) by organizing the arguments in a parallel fashion, which at the same time not only will yield\ndirect proofs, but even sharpenings of the statements.\nTheorem 1.1. The topological centre Zt (L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 ) of the Banach algebra L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 is precisely L1 (G).\nProof. This is the main result, Thm. 1, in [Lau\u2013Los 88].\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 22D15, 43A20, 43A22.\nKey words and phrases: locally compact group, group algebra, left uniformly continuous functions, Arens product,\ntopological centre.\nThe author is currently a PIMS Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, where this work was\naccomplished. The support of PIMS is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n1\n\n\fWe shall restrict ourselves to the most interesting situation where G is non-compact. In case G is\ncompact, the above assertion may be attained by a very short argument ([Lau\u2013Los 88], Thm. 1;\nalso cf. [I\u015fi\u2013Pym\u2013\u00dclg 87], Thm. 3.3 (vi)).\nThe second theorem even is only of interest in the non-compact case \u2013 for in case G is compact,\nLUC(G)\u2217 equals the measure algebra M(G), and the assertion is immediately veryfied.\nTheorem 1.2. The topological centre Zt (LUC(G)\u2217 ) of the Banach algebra LUC(G)\u2217 is M(G).\nProof. This is the main result, Thm. 1, in [Lau 86].\nIn the sequel, we will have to distinguish between the two Arens products on the bidual L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 .\nWe denote by \u2299 the first (= left) and by . the second (= right) Arens product, and use these\nsymbols as well for the various module operations linking L1 (G), its dual and bidual, as follows.\nLet m, n \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 , h \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217 , f, g \u2208 L1 (G). Denoting by \u2217 the convolution product of functions\n(whenever it is defined), we write:\nhh \u2299 f, gi\nhn \u2299 h, f i\nhm \u2299 n, hi\n\n:=\n:=\n:=\n\nhh, f \u2217 gi\nhn, h \u2299 f i\nhm, n \u2299 hi\n\n:=\n:=\n:=\n\nhh, g \u2217 f i\nhm, f.hi\nhn, h.mi.\n\nand, following a completely symmetric pattern:\nhf.h, gi\nhh.m, f i\nhm.n, hi\n\n1 \u02c7\nf , where \u2206\nWe note that, in particular, h \u2299 f = fe \u2217 h \u2208 LUC(G); here, as usual, we write fe := \u2206\n\u22121\ndenotes the modular function of G and f\u02c7(x) := f (x ) for all x \u2208 G. We refer to [Pal 94], \u00a71.4, for a\ndiscussion of basic properties of Arens multiplication in the framework of general Banach algebras.\nWhenever we consider L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 as a Banach algebra, we regard it as equipped with the first Arens\nproduct. We recall that the topological centre of L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 is defined to be the set of functionals\nm \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 which satisfy m \u2299 n = m.n for all n \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 . Equivalently, the topological centre\nconsists of all the functionals m \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 such that left multiplication by m is w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuous\non L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 . A detailed analysis of topological centres in the general context of biduals of Banach\nalgebras can be found, e.g., in [Lau\u2013\u00dclg 96].\nThere is an analogous notion of topological centre for the Banach algebra LUC(G)\u2217 . First, let us\nrecall the natural construction of the product in the latter space. \u2013 If n \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 and f \u2208 LUC(G),\nthen it is classical that the function n * f , defined through\n\n(n * f )(x) := hn, lx f i (x \u2208 G)\nstill belongs to LUC(G); i.e., LUC(G) is left introverted. This operation gives rise to the product on\nthe space LUC(G)\u2217 :\nhm * n, f i := hm, n * f i (m, n \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 , f \u2208 LUC(G))\nunder which the latter indeed becomes a Banach algebra, and LUC(G) becomes a left LUC(G)\u2217 module with the action introduced above. In analogy to the case of L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 , one defines the topological centre of LUC(G)\u2217 to be the set of elements m \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 such that left multiplication by\nm is w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuous on LUC(G)\u2217 .\n2\n\n\fWe shall also consider the natural (left) module operation of LUC(G)\u2217 on L\u221e (G) given by\nhm\u2738h, gi := hm, h \u2299 gi, where m \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 , h \u2208 L\u221e (G), g \u2208 L1 (G). At this point, we note that,\nas is easily seen, one has m\u2738h = m\ne \u2299 h, where m\ne is an arbitrary Hahn-Banach extension of the\n\u2217\nfunctional m to L\u221e (G) .\nThe main interest of the approach presented here consists in the following:\n\u2022 We obtain a sharpening of the non-trivial inclusion in the statements of both Theorem 1.1\nand 1.2. Namely, as for Theorem 1.1, we shall see that for an element m \u2208 L\u221e (G)\u2217 in order to\nbelong to L1 (G), it is sufficient to have m \u2299 n = m.n only for all n \u2208 L\u221e (G)\u2217 that are Hahnw\u2217\n\u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ) \u2013 instead of requiring the latter\nBanach extensions of functionals in \u03b4G\n\u2217\nequality for all n \u2208 L\u221e (G) , as does the definition of the topological centre. Analogously, in\nthe situation of Theorem 1.2, we will prove that an element m \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 already belongs to\nw\u2217\nM(G) if left multiplication by m is only w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuous on \u03b4G \u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ), instead\nof demanding this continuity on the whole unit ball of LUC(G)\u2217 .\n\u2022 The only proof known so far of the topological centre theorem for LUC(G)\u2217 is indirect (see Thm.\n1 in [Lau 86]), and all proofs given for the corresponding theorem for L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 either heavily\nrely on the latter ([Lau\u2013\u00dclg 96], [Gha\u2013McC 92]) or are also indirect (see [Lau\u2013Los 88],\nThm. 1). Our proofs of the two results are independent, and in both cases direct. \u2013 We\nremark en passant that the proofs of Thm. 5.4 and Cor. 5.5 in [Lau\u2013\u00dclg 96] are correct only\nunder the additional set-theoretic assumption that the compact covering number of the group\nG is a non-measurable cardinal, since the argument is based on ibid., Lemma 5.3, which in turn\nhas to be read with a similar set-theoretic assumption; we refer to [Neu 01] and [Hu\u2013Neu 01]\nfor a detailed discussion of these and related problems. The tool which enables us to overcome\nprecisely those set-theoretic difficulties is provided by Lemma 2.1 below.\n\u2022 The procedure we present shows a perfect analogy between the two topological centre theorems.\nBesides one additional structural result for LUC(G)\u2217 , the prerequisites are the same, and the\nproofs themselves follow completely parallel lines.\n\u2022 The method of proof follows a purely Banach algebraic procedure and does not, in particular,\nrely on any measure theoretic argument, so that it might be applied equally well in other\nsituations. At this point, we only mention that in [Hu\u2013Neu 01], we obtained an analogue of\nLemma 2.1 below in the \"dual\" setting, i.e., with L\u221e (G) replaced by the group von Neumann\nalgebra VN (G), and with k(G) replaced by b(G), the smallest cardinality of an open basis at\nthe neutral element of G. For Proposition 2.3 as well, a dual version is known at least in\nb \u2217 and B\u03c1 (G) take over the place\nthe case of amenable groups G \u2013 here, the algebras UCB(G)\n\u2217\nof LUC(G) and M(G), respectively. Thus, if we are able to prove a factorization result, for\nbounded families in VN (G) of cardinality at most b(G) * \u05d00 , corresponding to Lemma 2.2, then\nour method of proof would immediately yield an affirmative answer (for the most interesting\ncase of non-discrete groups G) of two longstanding conjectures at once \u2013 namely, the topological\ncentre of the bidual of the Fourier algebra A(G) being just A(G), i.e., Zt (A(G)\u2217\u2217 ) = A(G), and,\nb \u2217 ) = B\u03c1 (G).\nfor amenable groups G, Zt (UCB(G)\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nFor both proofs we will use the following two lemmata, which are of interest in their own right.\nLemma 2.1. For an arbitrary locally compact group G, the space L1 (G) enjoys Mazur's property of\nlevel k(G) * \u05d00 , where k(G) denotes the compact covering number of G (i.e., the least cardinality of a\ncompact covering of G). \u2013 This means that a functional m \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 actually belongs to L1 (G) if it\ncarries bounded w\u2217 -converging nets of cardinality at most k(G) * \u05d00 into converging nets.\nProof. This is Thm. 4.4 in [Neu 01].\nNext we present our crucial tool, which is a general factorization theorem for bounded families in\nL\u221e (G). It has already been used (cf. [Neu 01a])\n\u2022 to answer (in the affirmative) a question raised by Hofmeier\u2013Wittstock in [Hof\u2013Wit 97]\nconcerning the automatic boundedness of left L\u221e (G)\u2217 -module homomorphisms on L\u221e (G)\n\u2022 to give an alternative approach to the result on automatic w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuity of the latter\nmappings, as first shown by Ghahramani\u2013McClure in [Gha\u2013McC 92].\nLemma 2.2. Let G be a locally compact non-compact group with compact covering number k(G).\nLet further (h\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I \u2286 L\u221e (G) be a bounded family of functions where |I| \u2264 k(G). Then there exist\nw\u2217\na family (\u03c8\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I of functionals in \u03b4G \u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ) and a function h \u2208 L\u221e (G) such that the\nfactorization formula\nh\u03b1 = \u03c8\u03b1 \u2738h\nholds for all \u03b1 \u2208 I. (Moreover, the functionals \u03c8\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 I, do not depend, except for the index set,\non the given family (h\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I ; they are universal in the sense that they are obtained intrinsically from\nthe group G.)\nProof. See [Neu 00], Satz 3.6.2 (or [Neu 01a]).\nIn order to arrange the proof of Thm. 1.2 in a completely parallel manner, we only require the\nfollowing proposition, whose first part is a classical structural result about the algebra LUC(G)\u2217\ngoing back to the pioneering work of Curtis\u2013Fig\u00e0-Talamanca ([Cur\u2013Fig 65], Thm. 3.3). We write\nB \u03c3 (L\u221e (G)) for the space of normal (i.e., w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuous) operators on L\u221e (G).\nProposition 2.3. The mapping\n\u03c6 : LUC(G)\u2217 \u2212\u2192 B(L\u221e (G))\ndefined through\n\u03c6(m)(h) := m\u2738h\n\n(m \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 , h \u2208 L\u221e (G))\n\nis an isometric representation of LUC(G)\u2217 in B(L\u221e (G)) such that\n\u03c6(M(G)) = \u03c6(LUC(G)\u2217 ) \u2229 B \u03c3 (L\u221e (G)).\n\n4\n\n(1)\n\n\fProof. The first assertions are well-known (see, e.g., [Lau 78], Thm. 1, together with Lemma 1 and\nRemark 3; or [Cur\u2013Fig 65], Thm. 3.3, for a proof in the unimodular case). The relation (1) is seen\nas follows (cf. [Neu 00], Prop. 3.1.1). \u2013 In order to prove the inclusion \"\u2286\", let \u03bc \u2208 M(G). We have\nw\u2217\n\nto show that \u03c6(\u03bc) \u2208 B(L\u221e (G)) is normal. Consider a net (h\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2286 Ball(L\u221e (G)) such that h\u03b1 \u2212\u2192 0.\nFix g \u2208 L1 (G). We claim that\nh\u03c6(\u03bc)(h\u03b1 ), gi \u2212\u2192 0.\nBut we have:\nh\u03c6(\u03bc)(h\u03b1 ), gi = h\u03bc\u2738h\u03b1 , gi = h\u03bc, ge \u2217 h\u03b1 i =\n\nZ\n\n(e\ng \u2217 h\u03b1 )(t) d\u03bc(t),\n\nG\n\nwhere (as is readily checked) the net (e\ng \u2217 h\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2286 LUC(G) is equicontinuous, bounded and converges\npointwise to 0. It thus converges uniformly on compact subsets of G, whence we conclude that the\nabove integrals converge to 0, as desired.\nTurning to the inclusion \"\u2287\", let us consider an arbitrary element \u03c6(m) of the set on the\nright side, where m \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 . We denote by C0 (G) the space of all complex-valued continuous\nfunctions on G vanishing at infinity, and by C0 (G)\u22a5 its annihilator in LUC(G)\u2217 . Then we obviously have LUC(G)\u2217 = M(G) \u2295 C0 (G)\u22a5 (the latter is actually an l1 -direct sum \u2013 cf. Lemma 1.1\nin [Gha\u2013Lau\u2013Los 90] \u2013, but we will not need this fact). Write m = \u03bc + n with \u03bc \u2208 M(G) and\nn \u2208 C0 (G)\u22a5 according to this decomposition. It suffices to show that \u03c6(n) = 0.\nFirst, using the inclusion proved above, we see that \u03c6(n) = \u03c6(m) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03bc) is normal. Fix h \u2208\nL\u221e (G). We have h = \u03c3(L\u221e (G), L1 (G)) \u2212 lim\u03b1 h\u03b1 for an appropriate net (h\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2286 C0 (G). Hence we\nobtain:\n\u03c6(n)(h) = \u03c3(L\u221e (G), L1 (G)) \u2212 lim \u03c6(n)(h\u03b1 ) = 0,\n\u03b1\n\nwhich finishes the proof. \u2013 For the last equality, note that for all \u03b1 and arbitrary g \u2208 L1 (G):\nh\u03c6(n)(h\u03b1 ), gi = hn, ge \u2217 h\u03b1 i = 0,\n\nsince e\ng \u2217 h\u03b1 \u2208 L1 (G) \u2217 C0 (G) = C0 (G).\n\nRemark 2.4. We only stated the specific properties of \u03c6 for the sake of completeness. In the sequel,\nwe shall just use the fact that \u03c6 is bounded and injective, as well as the relation (1).\n\n3\n\nApplication to the topological centre problem\n\nWe first present the proof of Theorem 1.1, for non-compact groups G. \u2013 To establish the non-trivial\ninclusion, let m \u2208 Zt (L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 ). The group G being non-compact, we infer from Lemma 2.1 that\nL1 (G) has Mazur's property of level k(G). So to prove m \u2208 L1 (G), let (h\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I \u2286 L\u221e (G) be a bounded\nnet converging w\u2217 to 0, where |I| \u2264 k(G). Thanks to Lemma 2.2, we have the factorization\n\n\u2217\n\nf\u03b1 \u2299 h (\u03b1 \u2208 I)\nh\u03b1 = \u03c8\u03b1 \u2738h = \u03c8\n\nw\nf\u03b1 denotes some arbitrarily chosen\n\u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ) and h \u2208 L\u221e (G). \u2013 Here, \u03c8\nwith \u03c8\u03b1 \u2208 \u03b4G\n\u03b1\n\u2217\nHahn-Banach extension of \u03c8\u03b1 to L\u221e (G) . We have to show that a\u03b1 := hm, h\u03b1 i \u2212\u2192 0. Due to the\n\n5\n\n\fboundedness of (h\u03b1 )\u03b1 , it suffices to prove that every convergent subnet of (a\u03b1 )\u03b1 tends to 0. Let\n(hm, h\u03b1\u03b2 i)\u03b2 be such a convergent subnet. Furthermore, let\nE := w\u2217 \u2212^\nlim \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2208 Ball(L\u221e (G)\u2217 )\n\u03b3\n\nbe an arbitrarily chosen Hahn-Banach extension of some w\u2217 -cluster point of the net (\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 )\u03b2 in\nBall(LUC(G)\u2217 ).\nWe first note that E \u2299 h = 0, since for arbitrary g \u2208 L1 (G) we obtain:\nhE \u2299 h, gi = hE, h \u2299 gi = limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , h \u2299 gi\n\u03b3\n\n= limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2738h, gi = limhh\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , gi\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\n= 0.\nNow we conclude that (using twice the assumption m \u2208 Zt (L1 (G)\u2217\u2217 ) and in particular the fact that\nh.m \u2208 L1 (G)\u2217 \u2299 L1 (G) = LUC(G), cf. Lemma 3.1 a) in [Lau\u2013\u00dclg 96])\ng\ng\nlimhm, h\u03b1\u03b2 i = limhm, \u03c8\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u2299 hi = limhm \u2299 \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 , hi\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\ng\ng\n= limhm.\u03c8\n\u03b1\u03b2 , hi = limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 , h.mi\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\n= limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 , h.mi = limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , h.mi\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u2217\n=\nw \u2212 lim \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , h.m = hE, h.mi\n\u03b3\n\n= hm.E, hi = hm \u2299 E, hi\n= hm, E \u2299 hi = 0,\nwhich gives the desired convergence.\nWe now turn to the proof of Theorem 1.2. \u2013 The inclusion M(G) \u2286 Zt (LUC(G)\u2217 ) being immediate\nand classical (cf. [Won 72], Lemma 3.1), we restrict our attention to the reverse inclusion, where in\norder to avoid trivialities, we assume the group G to be non-compact. Fix m \u2208 Zt (LUC(G)\u2217 ). Then,\naccording to Proposition 2.3, we only have to prove that \u03c6(m) \u2208 B(L\u221e (G)) is w\u2217 -w\u2217 -continuous.\nTo this end, consider a bounded net (h\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208I \u2286 L\u221e (G), where |I| \u2264 k(G), which converges w\u2217 to 0.\nLemma 2.2 yields the factorization\nh\u03b1 = \u03c8\u03b1 \u2738h\n\n(\u03b1 \u2208 I)\n\nw\u2217\n\n\u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ) and h \u2208 L\u221e (G). By Lemma 2.1, we only have to show that\nwith \u03c8\u03b1 \u2208 \u03b4G\n\u03c6(m)(h\u03b1 ) tends w\u2217 to 0. The latter net being bounded, it suffices to prove that every convergent\nsubnet tends to 0. Let (\u03c6(m)(h\u03b1\u03b2 ))\u03b2 be such a convergent subnet. Furthermore, let\nE := w\u2217 \u2212 lim \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2208 \u03b4G\n\u03b3\n\nw\u2217\n\n\u2286 Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 )\n\nbe a w\u2217 -cluster point of the net (\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 )\u03b2 in Ball(LUC(G)\u2217 ).\n\n6\n\n\fWe remark that E\u2738h = 0, since for arbitrary g \u2208 L1 (G) we obtain:\nhE\u2738h, gi = hE, h \u2299 gi = limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , h \u2299 gi\n\u03b3\n\n= limh\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2738h, gi = limhh\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , gi\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\n= 0.\nIn order to conclude, we will only require the following fact concerning the compatibility of our\nvarious module operations, which is easy to verify (cf. \u00a72 in [Lau\u2013Pym 90]): For \u03c8 \u2208 LUC(G)\u2217 ,\nh \u2208 L\u221e (G) and g \u2208 L1 (G), we have\n(\u03c8\u2738h) \u2299 g = \u03c8 * (h \u2299 g).\nNow we obtain:\nlimh\u03c6(m)(h\u03b1\u03b2 ), gi = limhm\u2738h\u03b1\u03b2 , gi\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\n= limhm, h\u03b1\u03b2 \u2299 gi\n\u03b2\n\n= limhm, (\u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 \u2738h) \u2299 gi\n\u03b2\n\n= limhm, \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 * (h \u2299 g)i\n\u03b2\n\n= limhm * \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2 , h \u2299 gi\n\u03b2\n\n= limhm * \u03c8\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , h \u2299 gi\n\u03b3\n\n= hm * E, h \u2299 gi\n\nsince m \u2208 Zt (LUC(G)\u2217 )\n\n= hm, E * (h \u2299 g)i\n= hm, (E\u2738h) \u2299 gi\n= 0,\nwhich finishes the proof.\n\nReferences\n[Cur\u2013Fig 65] Curtis, P.
