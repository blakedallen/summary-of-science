The latest lattice calculations of nucleon\nstructure have been greatly developed with increasing accuracy [1]. So far, large efforts by lattice QCD simulations\nhave been mostly devoted to studies of electro-magnetic structure of the nucleon and either unpolarized or polarized\nparton distributions in deep inelastic scattering [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, there are only a few lattice studies to be\ncompleted for the weak nucleon form factors [6, 7], which are associated with weak probes of nucleon structure. In\nthis paper, we present results from our intensive study of the nucleon matrix elements of the weak current in quenched\nlattice QCD calculations with domain wall fermions (DWFs).\nExperimentally, weak processes meditated by the weak charged current like neutron beta decay n \u2192 p + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e ,\nmuon capture on the proton \u03bc\u2212 + p \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc + n or quasi-elastic neutrino scattering \u03bd\u0304\u03bc + p \u2192 \u03bc+ + n are mainly exploited\nfor studying the weak nucleon form factors, while available information obtained from the experiment of the neutral\ncurrent weak process such as semileptonic elastic scattering \u03bd + p \u2192 \u03bd + p is still limited. The weak current is known\nto be described by a linear combination of the vector and axial-vector currents. In general, four form factors appear in\nthe nucleon matrix elements of the weak current. Here, for example, we consider the matrix element for neutron beta\ndecay. In this case, the vector and axial-vector currents are given by V\u03b1+ (x) = \u016b(x)\u03b3\u03b1 d(x) and A+\n\u03b1 (x) = \u016b(x)\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 d(x)\nand then the matrix element is expressed by\n\u0002\n2\n2\nhp|V\u03b1+ (x) + A+\n\u03b1 (x)|ni = \u016bp \u03b3\u03b1 FV (q ) + \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03b2 FT (q )\n\u0003\n+\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 FA (q 2 ) + iq\u03b1 \u03b35 FP (q 2 ) un eiq*x ,\n(1)\n\nwhere q = Pn \u2212 Pp is the momentum transfer between the proton (p) and neutron (n). The vector (FV ) and induced\ntensor (FT ) form factors are introduced for the vector matrix element, and also the axial-vector (FA ) and induced\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ssasaki@phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\naddress: yamazaki@phys.uconn.edu; Present address:\nKitashirakawa-Oiwakecho, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nYukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University,\n\n\f2\npseudo-scalar (FP ) form factors for the axial-vector matrix element. The vector part of weak processes are related\nto the nucleon's electro-magnetic form factors, which are well measured up to large momentum transfer by electron\nscattering [8], through an isospin rotation. Based on the conserved-vector-current hypothesis, the vector and induced\ntensor form factors are well understood by knowledge of the electro-magnetic structure of the nucleon.\nIn the axial-vector part of the weak process, the axial-vector coupling gA = FA (q 2 = 0) is most accurately measured\nby neutron beta decay, where the extremely small momentum transfer is accessible due to a very small mass difference\nof the neutron and proton. The q 2 -dependence of FA (q 2 ) can be determined by other processes such as quasi-elastic\nneutrino scattering experiments and charged pion electroproduction experiments. It has been observed that the dipole\nform is a good description for low and moderate momentum transfer, q 2 < 1 GeV2 [9]. On the other hand, the induced\npseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ) is rather less known experimentally. The main source of information on FP (q 2 ) stems\nfrom muon capture. The induced pseudo-scalar coupling, gP = m\u03bc FP (q 2 ) evaluated at q 2 = 0.88m2\u03bc , where m\u03bc is the\nmuon mass, is measured by ordinary muon capture (OMC) or radiative muon capture (RMC). Although there is some\ndiscrepancy between the OMC result and the RMC result [9, 10], the new precise OMC measurement by the MuCap\ncollaboration, which is nearly independent of \u03bc-molecular effect, yields gP = 7.3 \u00b1 1.1 [11]. Only a few of the other\nq 2 data points on FP (q 2 ) are measured in the low q 2 region by a single experiment of pion electroproduction [12].\nTheoretically, in the axial part of such weak processes at low energies, one may consider that spontaneous chiral\nsymmetry breaking, which is induced by the strong interaction, plays an essential role. In other words, the axial\nstructure of the nucleon would be highly connected with the physics of chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking,\nwhich ensures the presence of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone particles such as the pion. This is empirically known as\nthe partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis [8], where the divergence of the axial-vector current\nis proportional to the pion field. Applying this idea to the axial-vector part of Eq.(1), there appears a specific\nrelation between the residue of the pion-pole structure in FP (q 2 ) and the axial-vector coupling gA known as the\nGoldberger-Treiman relation [13].\nThere was the long standing disagreement between experiment and lattice calculations about the axial-vector\ncoupling gA . However, the RBC Collaboration finally resolved this puzzle using quenched DWF simulations [14, 15].\nDWFs are expected to provide an implementation of lattice fermions with exact chiral symmetry [16, 17, 18]. In the\nlimit where the fifth-dimensional extent Ls is taken to infinity, DWFs preserve the axial Ward-Takahashi identity,\neven at a finite lattice spacing [18]. Although not sufficiently large Ls loses the virtues of DWFs, the explicit chiral\nsymmetry breaking with moderate sizes of Ls can be attributed to a single universal \"residual mass\" parameter mres ,\nacting as an additive quark mass in the axial Ward-Takahashi identity as \u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 \u2248 2(mf + mres )P a [19, 20]. A very\nsmall value of mres , which is typically smaller than 10% of the quark mass, is always achieved at a given Ls around 1020 with the help of improved gauge actions [20]. This fact greatly simplifies the nonperturbative determination of the\nrenormalization of quark bilinear currents [21]. For a calculation of the axial-vector coupling gA , the chiral symmetry\nis very useful because the renormalization factors of local vector and local axial-vector current operators are equal,\nZV = ZA [21]. This means that the ratio of the nucleon axial-vector and vector couplings, gA /gV , calculated on the\nlattice is not renormalized [15]. Therefore, in DWF simulations, the ambiguity in the renormalization of quark currents,\nwhich is present in other fermions such as Wilson-type fermions, is eliminated. In Ref. [15], gA = 1.212(27) in the\nchiral limit is obtained from quenched DWF simulations. It underestimates the experimental value of 1.2695(29) [22]\nby less than 5%. It has also shown that there is a significant finite volume effect between the axial-vector couplings\ncalculated on lattices with (1.2 fm)3 and (2.4 fm)3 volumes. This observation strongly indicates that the axial-vector\ncoupling is particularly sensitive to finite volume effects. Subsequently, the LHPC Collaboration has evaluated the\naxial-vector coupling using domain wall valence fermions with improved staggered sea quark configurations with\nphysical volume as large as (3.5 fm)3 and obtained gA = 1.226(84) at the physical pion mass [23]. Its value again\nagrees with experiment within 5%.\nIn this paper, we naturally extend the quenched DWF calculation for exploring the axial structure of the nucleon,\nnamely the axial-vector form factor and the induced pseudo-scalar form factor at low q 2 as well as the electro-magnetic\nstructure of the nucleon. Especially, to evaluate the induced pseudo-scalar coupling gP is one of our main targets, since\nno intensive study has been done to determine this particular quantity in lattice QCD. Recall that the induced pseudoscalar form factor is assumed to be dominated by a pion pole, which give rises to very rapid q 2 -dependence at low\nq 2 . The larger physical volume, where the lower momentum transfers are accessible, is required. We therefore utilize\n(3.6 fm)3 volume where the smallest momentum squared (q 2 \u2248 0.1 GeV2 ) is smaller than measured pion mass squared\n(m2\u03c0 > 0.15 GeV2 ). We also re-examine the finite volume effect on the axial-vector coupling using three different\nvolumes, which include (3.6 fm)3 together with smaller ones (1.8 fm)3 and (2.4 fm)3 . Furthermore, we calculate the\nnucleon matrix element of the pseudo-scalar density hp|\u016b\u03b35 d|ni to check the axial Ward-Takahashi identity in terms\nof the nucleon matrix elements, which may be called as the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation [24].\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we first present a brief introduction of the weak nucleon form\nfactors and the status of experimental studies. In Section III, details of our Monte Carlo simulations and some basic\nresults are given. We also describes the lattice method for calculating the nucleon form factors. Section IV presents\n\n\f3\nour results of the four weak form factors as well as the pseudo-scalar form factor on lattice with (3.6 fm)3 volume.\nEspecially, the q 2 -dependences of all measured form factors at low q 2 are discussed with great interest. At the end of\nthis section, we discuss the consequence of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity among the axial-vector form factor, the\ninduced pseudo-scalar form factor and the pseudo-scalar form factor. In Section V, we discuss the finite volume effects\non the form factors using results from three different volumes. Meanwhile, we also check whether approximated forms\nof q 2 -dependence of form factors, which are observed at low q 2 , are still valid even in the relatively high q 2 region,\nup to at least q 2 \u2248 1.0 GeV2 , apart from consideration of the finite volume effects. In Section VI, we compare our\nresults with previous works. Finally, in Section VII, we summarize the present work and discuss future directions.\nII.\n\nWEAK NUCLEON FORM FACTORS AND EXPERIMENTAL STATUS\n\nIn general, the nucleon matrix elements of the weak current are given by a linear combination of the vector and\naxial-vector matrix elements. Here, let us introduce the vector and axial-vector currents, which are expressed in terms\nof the isospin doublet of quark fields \u03c8 = (u, d)T\nV\u03b1a (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3\u03b1 ta \u03c8(x),\nAa\u03b1 (x) = \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 ta \u03c8(x),\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere ta are the SU (2) flavor matrices normalized to obey Tr(ta tb ) = \u03b4ab . Then, the nucleon matrix elements are\ngiven by\nhN (P \u2032 )|J\u03b1wk (x)|N (P )i = hN (P \u2032 )|V\u03b1a (x) + Aa\u03b1 (x)|N (P )i\n\u0001\n= uN (P \u2032 ) O\u03b1V (q) + O\u03b1A (q) ta uN (P )eiq*x ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nO\u03b1V (q) = \u03b3\u03b1 FV (q 2 ) + \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 q\u03b2 FT (q 2 )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere q \u2261 P \u2212 P \u2032 is the momentum transfer between the initial (P ) state and the final state (P \u2032 ) and N represents\nthe nucleon isospin doublet as N = (p, n)T . Four form factors are needed to describe these matrix elements: the weak\nvector and induced tensor (weak magnetism) form factors for the vector current,\n\nand the weak axial-vector and induced pseudo-scalar form factors for the axial-vector current [54]\nO\u03b1A (q) = \u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 FA (q 2 ) + iq\u03b1 \u03b35 FP (q 2 ),\n\n(7)\n\n \u0304 \u03b1 d|pi = hp|j em |pi \u2212 hn|j em |ni,\nhp|\u016b\u03b3\u03b1 d|ni = hp|\u016b\u03b3\u03b1 u \u2212 d\u03b3\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(8)\n\nF1v (q 2 ) = FV (q 2 ),\nF2v (q 2 ) = 2MN FT (q 2 ),\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhich are here given in the Euclidean metric convention [55]. Thus, q 2 denoted in this paper, which stands for\n2\nEuclidean four-momentum squared, corresponds to the time-like momentum squared as qM\n= \u2212q 2 < 0 in Minkowski\nspace.\nThe weak matrix elements are related to the electro-magnetic matrix elements if the strange contribution is ignored\nunder the exact iso-spin symmetry. A simple exercise in SU (2) Lie algebra leads to the following relation between\nthe vector part of the weak matrix elements of neutron beta decay and the difference of proton and neutron electromagnetic matrix elements [8, 15]:\n \u0304 \u03b1 d. This relation gives a connection between the weak vector and induced tensor form\nwhere j\u03b1em = 23 \u016b\u03b3\u03b1 u \u2212 13 d\u03b3\nfactors and the iso-vector part of electro-magnetic nucleon form factors\n\nwhere F1v (F2v ) denotes the iso-vector combination of the Dirac (Pauli) form factors of the proton and neutron, which\nare defined by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\u03b2\n\u2032\nem\nN 2\n\u2032\nN 2\nhN (P )|j\u03b1 (x)|N (P )i = uN (P ) \u03b3\u03b1 F1 (q ) + \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\nF (q ) uN (P ),\n(11)\n2MN 2\nwhere MN denotes the nucleon mass, which is defined as the average of neutron and proton masses, and N represents p\n(proton) or n (neutron). Experimental data from elastic electron-nucleon scattering is usually presented in terms of the\nelectric GE (q 2 ) and magnetic GM (q 2 ) Sachs form factors which are related to the Dirac and Pauli form factors [8, 26]\n2\nN 2\nGN\nE (q ) = F1 (q ) \u2212\n\nq2\nN 2\n2 F2 (q ),\n4MN\n\n2\nN 2\nN 2\nGN\nM (q ) = F1 (q ) + F2 (q ).\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n\f4\nTheir normalization at q 2 = 0 are given by the proton (neutron) charge and magnetic moment [22]:\nProton: GpE (0) = 1, GpM (0) = \u03bcp = +2.792847351(28),\nNeutron: GnE (0) = 0, GnM (0) = \u03bcn = \u22121.91304273(45).\n\n(14)\n\ngPMuCap = 7.3 \u00b1 1.1.\n\n(15)\n\nTherefore, one finds FV (0) = GpE (0) \u2212 GnE (0) = 1 and 2MN FT (0) = GpM (0) \u2212 GnM (0) \u2212 1 = 3.70589. As for the\nq 2 -dependence of the form factors, it is experimentally known that the standard dipole parametrization GD (q 2 ) =\n\u039b2 /(\u039b2 + q 2 ) with \u039b = 0.84 GeV (or \u039b2 = 0.71 GeV2 ) describes well the magnetic form factors of both the proton\nand neutron and also the electric form factor of the proton, at least, in the low q 2 region [26]. Here, the current\ninteresting issues of the q 2 -dependence of the electro-magnetic form factors at higher q 2 are beyond the scope of this\npaper. Recent reviews on the experimental situation can be found in Ref. [26]. The slopes of the form factors at\nq 2 = 0 determine mean-squared radii, which can be related to dipole masses as hri2 i = 12/Mi2 (i = E or M ) in the\ndipole form Gi (q 2 ) = Gi (0)/(1 + q 2 /Mi2 ). The experimental values of the electric root mean-squared (rms) radius\nfor the proton and the magnetic rms radii of the proton and neutron are compiled in Table I. These rms radii are\nall equal within errors and are in agreement with the empirical dipole parameter \u039b. On the other hand, the slope of\nthe neutron electric form factor GnE (q 2 ) is determined with high precision from double-polarization measurements of\nneutron knock-out from a polarized 2 H or 3 He target, while only a small deviation from zero is observed for GnE (q 2 )\nat low q 2 [26]. Combined with all four of the electric charge and magnetization radii of the proton\np and neutron, we\nfinally evaluate\nthe\nrms\nradii\nfor\nthe\nweak\nvector\nform\nfactor\nand\ninduced\ntensor\nform\nfactor\nas\nh(rV )2 i = 0.797(4)\np\n2\nfm and h(rT ) i = 0.879(18) fm, which correspond to the dipole masses, MV = 0.857(8) GeV and MT = 0.778(23)\nGeV. See Appendix A for details.\nThe axial-vector form factor at zero momentum transfer, namely the axial-vector coupling gA = FA (0), is precisely\ndetermined by measurements of the beta asymmetry in neutron decay. The value of gA = 1.2695(29) is quoted in the\n2006 PDG [22]. Nevertheless, kinematics of neutron beta decay are quite limited due to a very small mass difference of\nthe proton and neutron. Other experimental methods are utilized for determination of the q 2 -dependence of FA (q 2 ).\nFor this purpose, there are basically two types of experiment, namely quasi-elastic neutrino scattering and charged\npion electroproduction experiments. The former suffers from severe experimental uncertainties concerning the incident\nneutrino flux and the background subtraction of elastic events, while model-dependent analysis is somewhat inevitable\nfor the latter [9]. Both methods reported that the dipole form FA (q 2 ) = FA (0)/(1 + q 2 /MA2 ) is a good description\nfor low and moderate momentum transfer, q 2 < 1 GeV2 . The resulting world average of the dipole mass parameter\nMA is quoted as MA = 1.026(21) GeV from neutrino scattering or MA = 1.069(16) GeV from pion electroproduction\nin Ref. [9]. As for a small discrepancy between two averages, it has been argued that within heavy-baryon chiral\nperturbation theory (HBChPT) the finite pion mass correction of \u22120.055 GeV to the latterp\nvalue may resolve this\ndiscrepancy [9]. Therefore, one can translate the axial dipole mass into the axial rms radius of h(rA )2 i = 0.67(1) fm,\nwhich is consistently obtained from quasi-elastic neutrino scattering experiments and charged pion electroproduction\nexperiments [9].\nOn the other hand, the induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ) is less well-known experimentally [10]. The main\nsource of information on FP (q 2 ) stems from ordinary muon capture (OMC) on the proton, \u03bc\u2212 + p \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc + n. One\nmeasures the induced pseudo-scalar coupling gP = m\u03bc FP (q02 ) at the specific momentum transfer for the muon capture\nby the proton at rest as q02 = 0.88m2\u03bc . The induced pseudo-scalar coupling gP is also measured in radiative muon\ncapture (RMC), \u03bc\u2212 + p \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03bd\u03bc + n. Before 2006, the Saclay OMC experiment, which was the most recent OMC\nexperiment at that time, reported (gPOMC )Saclay,original = 8.7 \u00b1 1.9 [28]. Combining with the older OMC experiments\nincluding bubble chamber measurements, the world average for OMC is obtained as (gPOMC )old Ave = 8.79 \u00b1 1.92,\nwhich is given in Refs. [9] and [28]. Surprisingly, this value is close to the theoretically predicted value by HBChPT,\ngPChPT = 8.26 \u00b1 0.16 [9]. However, the novel RMC experiment at TRIUMF [29, 30] is puzzling: their measured\nvalue of gPRMC = 12.4 \u00b1 1.0 is quite higher than the theoretical value as is the OMC value as gPRMC \u2248 1.4gPOMC .\nThis disagreement is reduced by reanalysis with the updated \u03bc+ lifetime [10]. Then, the updated result of the\nSaclay OMC experiment yields (gPOMC )Saclay,updated = 10.6 \u00b1 2.7. Accordingly, the weighted world average for OMC,\n(gPOMC )updated Ave. = 10.5\u00b11.8 given in Ref. [10], is shifted away from the theoretical expected value, while the updated\naverage value is in agreement with the RMC result within its error. Indeed, there is a caveat that the ortho-para\ntransition rate in \u03bc-molecular Hydrogen, to which either OMC and RMC results are very sensitive, is poorly known\ndue to mutually inconsistent results among two experiments [28, 31] and theory [32]. Comprehensive reviews of a\nhistory of gP have been given in Refs.[9] and [10].\nRecently, a new OMC experiment has been done by the MuCap Collaboration [11]. The MuCap result is nearly\nindependent of \u03bc-molecular effects in contrast with the previous OMC experiments and the RMC experiment. After\nthe electro-weak radiative corrections, which were underestimated in the old literature, are correctly taken into\naccount [33], the new precise OMC measurement yields\n\n\f5\nIncluding the new MuCap result and taking into account the electro-weak radiative corrections, the new world average\nof the OMC results becomes (gPOMC )newAve = 8.7 \u00b1 1.0 [33]. As for other q 2 data of FP (q 2 ), only a few data points\nare measured in the low q 2 region by a single experiment of pion electroproduction at threshold [12]. These data\nare summarized in Table II. Three data points from pion electroproduction at threshold are well fitted by the pionpole dominance form, FP (q 2 ) = 2MN FA (q 2 )/(q 2 + m2\u03c0 ) [35], which is also consistent with the value determined by\nthe new OMC result at q 2 = 0.88m2\u03bc . Therefore, the pion-pole dominance is confirmed, more or less, through pion\nelectroproduction [12].\nIII.\n\nSIMULATION DETAILS\n\nWe work in the quenched approximation and use domain wall fermions (DWFs) to compute the nucleon matrix\nelements of the weak current. We generate ensembles of the quenched QCD configuration with the renormalization\ngroup improved, DBW2 (doubly blocked Wilson in two-dimensional parameter space) gauge action [36, 37] at \u03b2 =\n6/g 2 = 0.87 (a\u22121 \u2248 1.3 GeV), where the residual chiral symmetry breaking of domain wall fermions is significantly\nimproved with a moderate size of the fifth-dimension Ls such as Ls = 16 [20]. Indeed, the residual quark mass for\nLs = 16 is measured as small as mres \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 in lattice units [20], which is safely negligible compared with the\ninput quark masses in our simulations, 0.02 \u2264 mf \u2264 0.08. We work with relatively coarse lattice spacing, a \u2248 0.15\nfm [56], which is determined from the \u03c1 meson mass [20].\nTo study finite volume effects, numerical simulations are performed on three different lattice sizes L3 \u00d7 T = 243 \u00d7 32,\n163 \u00d7 32 and 123 \u00d7 32. The spatial extents in our study correspond to La \u2243 3.6, 2.4 and 1.8 fm. Quark propagators\nare generated for four bare masses mf = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 for L = 24 and three bare masses mf = 0.04, 0.06\nand 0.08 for L = 16 and 12, using DWFs with Ls = 16 and M5 = 1.8. Details of our simulations are summarized in\nTable III. In Table IV, some basic physics results are compiled from Ref. [20].\nThe pseudo-scalar meson (pion) masses computed in these calculations are summarized in Table V. All fitted values\nare obtained from the covariant single cosh fit. It is clear that there is no visible finite-volume effect on the pion\nmass. Measured values for L = 16 are in good agreement with the values found in Ref. [15], where point-to-box quark\npropagators are used with the mostly same gauge ensembles, while the point-to-gauss-smeared quark propagators are\nutilized in the present study. Our simulated values of the pion mass range from 0.39 GeV to 0.76 GeV.\nA.\n\nNucleon spectra and Dispersion relation\n\nIn order to compute nucleon masses or matrix elements, we define the nucleon (proton) operator as\nX\n\u03c7S (t, p) =\ne\u2212ip*x \u03b5abc [uTa (y1 , t)C\u03b35 db (y2 , t)]uc (y3 , t) \u00d7 \u03c6(y1 \u2212 x)\u03c6(y2 \u2212 x)\u03c6(y3 \u2212 x),\n\n(16)\n\nx\n\nwhere abc and ud have usual meanings as color and flavor indices. C is the charge conjugation matrix defined as\nC = \u03b3t \u03b3y and the superscript T denotes transpose. The superscript S of the nucleon operator \u03c7 specifies the smearing\nfor the quark propagators. In this study, we use two types of source: local source as \u03c6(yi \u2212 x) = \u03b4(yi \u2212 x) and\nGaussian smeared source. Here we take y1 = y2 = y3 = 0 in our calculation. As for the Gaussian smeared source,\nwe apply the gauge-invariant Gaussian smearing [41, 42] with N = 30, \u03c9 = 4.35. Details of our choice of smearing\nparameters are described in Ref. [43].\nWe construct two types of the two-point function for the proton. One interpolating operator at the source location\nis constructed from Gaussian smeared quark fields, while the other interpolating operator at the sink location is either\nconstructed from local quark fields (denoted LG) or Gaussian smeared ones (denoted GG):\nCSG (t \u2212 tsrc , q) =\n\no\n1 n\nTr P+ h\u03c7S (t, q)\u03c7G (tsrc , \u2212q) ,\n4\n\n(17)\n\nt\ncan eliminate contributions from the opposite-parity state\nwith S = L or G. The projection operator P+ = 1+\u03b3\n2\n2\nfor q = 0 [44, 45]. It is rather expensive to make the Gaussian smeared interpolating operator projected onto a\nspecific finite momentum at the source location (tsrc ). However, it is sufficient to project only the sink operator onto\nthe desired momentum by virtue of momentum conservation. Thus, the quark fields at the source location are not\nprojected onto any specific momentum in this calculation. For the momentum at the sink location (tsink ), we take all\npossible permutations of the three-momentum q including both positive and negative directions.\nNucleon masses and energies are computed by using the LG correlators with the five lowest momenta: (0, 0, 0),\n(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1) and (2, 0, 0) in units of 2\u03c0/L. All fitted values, which are obtained from the conventional\n\n\f6\nsingle exponential fit, for each volume are summarized in Table V. Next, we examine the dispersion relation of the\nnucleon state in our simulations. The purpose of this examination is two fold: 1) Our analysis should be restricted\nto the lower momenta that do not suffer from large O(a2 ) errors. 2) The evaluation of the squared four-momentum\ntransfer q 2 requires precise knowledge of the nucleon energies with finite momentum. The later point can be achieved\nby an estimation of the energy E(p) with the help of the dispersion relation and the measured nucleon rest mass MN\nthat can be most precisely measured.\nFor mf = 0.04 the measured values of the nucleon energy, which are obtained from L = 24 (open circles), L = 16\n(open squares) and L = 12 (open diamonds), are compared with the relativistic dispersion relation\nq\n2\n(18)\nE(p) = p2 + MN\n\nin Fig. 1 with either the naive discrete (continuum-like) momentum pi = 2\u03c0\nL ni or the lattice discrete momentum\n2\u03c0\npi = sin[ L ni ] (ni = 0, 1, 2, * * *, (L \u2212 1)) for p = (px , py , pz ). We observe that the measured energies E(p) are\nconsistent with the estimated values from the relativistic dispersion formula for continuum-like momenta (dasheddotted curve) and lattice momenta (dashed curve) in the range of our admitted momentum except for the largest\nmomentum on the lattice with L = 12 as shown in Fig. 1 . The difference between either choice of the discrete\nmomentum is mostly comparable to the statistical errors, while differences increase at the larger momentum. To\nrestrict ourselves to low q 2 region (q 2 < 1 GeV2 ), we do not use the two largest momenta on the lattice with L = 12\nfor the proceeding analysis. Therefore, it is not a concern to choose what type of the discrete momentum in the\ndispersion relation in our current calculation. We simply choose the continuum-like momentum throughout this paper\nand then evaluate the values of the squared four-momentum transfer q 2 with the measured rest mass MN and the\ncontinuum dispersion relation (18).\nB.\n\nThree point correlation functions\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, under the exact iso-spin symmetry (mu = md ), the SU (2) current algebra\nleads to the following relations [8, 15]\nhp|V\u03b1+ |ni = 2hp|V\u03b13 |pi,\n3\nhp|A+\n\u03b1 |ni = 2hp|A\u03b1 |pi,\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n \u0304 \u03b1 d) and A3 = 1 (\u016b\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 u \u2212 d\u03b3\n \u0304 \u03b1 \u03b35 d). Thus, we may calculate the weak transition matrix\nwhere V\u03b13 = 12 (\u016b\u03b3\u03b1 u \u2212 d\u03b3\n\u03b1\n2\nelements by the iso-vector proton matrix elements.\nFirst of all, we define the finite-momentum three-point functions for the relevant components of either the local\nA\n \u0304\nvector current (J\u03b1V (x) = \u016b(x)\u03b3\u03b1 u(x) \u2212 d(x)\u03b3\n\u03b1 d(x)) or the local axial-vector current (J\u03b1 (x) = \u016b(x)\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 u(x) \u2212\n \u0304\nd(x)\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b35 d(x)) with the proton interpolating operator \u03c7:\nh\u03c7(t\u2032 , p\u2032 )J\u03b1\u0393 (t, q)\u03c7(0, \u2212p)i = G\u03b1\u0393 (p, p\u2032 ) \u00d7 f (t, t\u2032 , E(p), E(p\u2032 )) + * * *,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the initial and final proton states carry fixed momenta p and p\u2032 respectively and then the current operator has\na three-dimensional momentum transfer q = p \u2212 p\u2032 . Here, Dirac indices have been suppressed. The ellipsis denotes\nexcited state contributions which can be ignored in the case of t\u2032 \u2212 t \u226b 1 and t \u226b 1. We separate the correlation\nfunction into two parts: G\u03b1\u0393 (p, p\u2032 ) which is defined as\nG\u03b1\u0393 (p, p\u2032 ) = (\u2212i\u03b3 * p\u2032 + MN )O\u03b1\u0393 (q)(\u2212i\u03b3 * p + MN ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere O\u03b1\u0393 (q) corresponds to either Eq.(6) or Eq.(7), and the factor f (t, t\u2032 , E(p), E(p\u2032 )) which collects all the kinematical factors, normalization of states, and time dependence of the correlation function. The trace of G\u03b1\u0393 (p, p\u2032 ) with some\nappropriate projection operator P for specific combinations of \u0393 and \u03b1 yields some linear combination of form factors\nin each \u0393 channel. On the other hand, all time dependences of the factor f (t, t\u2032 , E(p), E(p\u2032 )) can be eliminated by\nthe appropriate ratio of three- and two-point functions [2, 3]\n\u0014 LG\n\u00151\nP\nC\u0393,\u03b1\n(t, p\u2032 , p)\nC (tsink \u2212 t, p)C GG (t \u2212 tsrc , p\u2032 )C LG (tsink \u2212 tsrc , p\u2032 ) 2\nR(t) = GG\n,\nC (tsink \u2212 tsrc , p\u2032 ) C LG (tsink \u2212 t, p\u2032 )C GG (t \u2212 tsrc , p)C LG (tsink \u2212 tsrc , p)\n\n(23)\n\nwhere\nP\nC\u0393,\u03b1\n(t, q) =\n\no\n1 n\nTr Ph\u03c7G (tsink , p\u2032 )J\u03b1\u0393 (t, q)\u03c7G (tsrc , \u2212p)i ,\n4\n\n(24)\n\n\f7\nwhich are calculated by the sequential source method described in Ref. [15]:\nIn this study, we consider only the case at the rest frame of the final state (p\u2032 = 0), which leads to q = p. Therefore,\nthe squared four-momentum transfer is given by q 2 = 2MN (E(q) \u2212 MN ). Nucleon energy E(q) is simply abbreviated\nas E, hereafter. In this kinematics, G\u03b1\u0393 (p, p\u2032 ) is represented by a simple notation as G\u03b1\u0393 (q). Then, the ratio (23) gives\nthe asymptotic form as a function of the current-operator insertion time t,\nR(t) \u2192\n\n1\n1\nTr{PG\u03b1\u0393 (q)} \u00d7 p\n2\n4\n2MN E(E + MN )\n\n(25)\n\nin the limit when the Euclidean time separation between all operators is large, tsink \u226b t \u226b tsrc with fixed tsrc and\ntsink .\nWe choose particular combinations of the projection operator P and the current operator J\u03b1\u0393 (\u0393 = V or A). We\nconsider two types of the projection operator, P t = P+ \u03b3t and P5z = P+ \u03b35 \u03b3z in this study. The latter projection\noperator implies that the z-direction is chosen as the polarized direction. We then obtain some linear combination of\ndesired form factors from the projected correlation functions,\n1 \b t V\nTr P Gt (q)\n4\n1 \b z V\nTr P5 Gi (q)\n4\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= MN (E + MN ) FV (q 2 ) \u2212 (E \u2212 MN )FT (q 2 ) ,\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2212i\u03b5ijz qj MN FV (q 2 ) + 2MN FT (q 2 ) ,\n\nfor the vector currents JtV and JiV (i = x, y, z). Similarly, we get\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 \b z A\nqi qz\n2\n2\nFP (q ) ,\nTr P5 Gi (q) = MN (E + MN ) FA (q )\u03b4iz \u2212\n4\nE + MN\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nfor the axial-vector current JiA (i = x, y, z). In this calculation, we use at most the four non-zero three-momentum\n2\ntransfer q = 2\u03c0\nL n (n = 1, 2, 3, 4). All possible permutations of the lattice momentum including both positive\nand negative directions are properly taken into account. All three-point correlation functions are calculated with a\nsource-sink separation of 10 in lattice units, which is the same in the previous DWF calculation of the axial-vector\ncoupling gA [15]. For L = 24, we calculate three-point correlation functions with three different sequential sources\ngenerated with source-sink locations, [tsrc , tsink ] = [0, 10], [10, 20], and [20, 30] on a given gauge configuration [57],\nwhile only a single sequential source with [tsrc , tsink ] = [0, 10] is utilized for L = 12 and L = 16 calculations.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the dimensionless projected correlators\n\u039bV0 =\n\n1\nt V\n4 Tr{P Gt\n\n(q)}\n,\nMN (E + MN )\n\n\u039bVT = \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n1\nz V\n4 Tr{P5 Gx\n\n(29)\n(q)}\n\niqy MN\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nz V\n4 Tr{P5 Gy\n\n(q)}\n\niqx MN\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nas a function of the current insertion time slice t for mf = 0.04 on the largest volume (L = 24) as typical examples.\nGood plateaus for all squared three-momentum transfer are observed in the middle region between the source and\nsink points. The quoted errors are estimated by a single elimination jack-knife method. The lines plotted in each\nfigure represent the average value (solid lines) and their one standard deviations (dashed lines) in the time-slice range\n3 \u2264 t \u2264 7.\nA\nSimilarly, Fig. 3 shows \u039bA\nL and \u039bT for the axial vector current, which are defined by\n\u039bA\nL =\n\n1\nz A\n4 Tr{P5 Gz (q)}\n\nMN (E + MN )\n\n\u039bA\nT = \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n,\n\n1\nz A\n4 Tr{P5 Gx (q)}\n\nqz qx\n\n(31)\n+\n\n1\nz A\n4 Tr{P5 Gy (q)}\n\nqz qy\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nIt is worth noting that in the axial-vector channel the z-direction is chosen as the polarized direction in this study.\nTherefore, the longitudinal momentum (qz ) dependence explicitly appears in Eq. (28). This fact provides two kinematical constraints on determination of the three-point functions in our calculation. First, there are two types of\nkinematics, qz 6= 0 and qz = 0 in the longitudinal component (i = z) of Eq. (28), except for the case of n2 = 3 where\nqz is always non-zero. Secondly, the transverse components (i = x or y) of Eq. (28) are prevented from vanishing\nby the kinematics only if n2 = 2 and 3, where two components of the momentum including the polarized direction\n\n\f8\nA\n(z-direction) are non-zero. These are the reasons why \u039bA\nL (qz = 0) and \u039bL (qz 6= 0) are separately plotted in Fig. (3)\nA\n2\nA\n2\nand results of \u039bL (qz = 0) at n = 3 and \u039bT at n = 1, 4 are missing there.\nFinally, we recall that the lattice local operators J\u03b1\u0393 (x) (\u0393 = V or A), which are represented as the quark bilinear\ncurrents, receive finite renormalizations relative to their continuum counterparts. Thus the renormalized form factors\nrequire some independent estimation of Z\u0393 , the renormalization of the quark bilinear currents, [J\u03b1\u0393 ]ren = Z\u0393 [J\u03b1\u0393 ]lattice .\nAs mentioned previously, good chiral properties of DWFs ensure that the lattice renormalizations of the local currents\nare equal, ZV = ZA , up to terms of order O(a2 ) in the chiral limit and neglecting explicit chiral symmetry breaking\ndue to the moderate size of the fifth-dimensional extent Ls [21]. In this paper, we evaluate ZV at each quark mass from\nthe inverse of FV (0) that should be unity in the continuum under the exact SU (2) iso-spin symmetry and multiply\nfour weak form factors by this renormalization factor ZV to estimate the renormalized form factors in the chiral limit.\n\nC.\n\nVector coupling gV and axial-vector coupling gA\n\nAt zero three-momentum transfer |q| = 0, only \u039bV0 and \u039bA\nL are calculable. Then, these directly yield the values\nof (gV )lattice and (gA )lattice respectively. Our results of (gV )lattice , (gA )lattice and their ratio (gA )ren = (gA /gV )lattice\nobtained in this calculation are summarized in Table VI, where old results for L = 8 and L = 16 calculated in\nRef. [15] are also tabulated. In Fig. 4, we show the ratios of the axial to the vector coupling (gA /gV )lattice calculated\nfor three different volumes as functions of pion mass squared. Clearly, the finite volume effect on (gA /gV )lattice can be\nobserved. The larger volume results exhibit milder quark mass dependence, while the smallest volume results show a\nslow downward tendency toward the chiral limit away from the experimental point. Therefore, for the largest volume\nresults, we simply adopt a linear extrapolation with respect to the pion mass squared to take the chiral limit. We\nren\nobtain the axial-vector coupling gA\n= 1.219(38) at the physical point (m\u03c0 = 0.14 GeV).\nWe next examine more details of the finite volume effect on the vector and axial-vector couplings separately.\nCombined results from three different spatial sizes, La \u2248 1.8 fm, 2.4 fm and 3.6 fm together with old results from\nLa \u2248 1.2 fm, we plot (gV )lattice and (gA )lattice against the spatial lattice size in the physical unit in Fig. 5. The quoted\nerrors in the figure represent only the statistical errors, which are obtained by a single elimination jack-knife method.\nThe left (right) figure is for lighter (heavier) pion mass. The axial-vector coupling (gA )lattice shows the significant\nspatial-size dependence, while we do not see any serious finite volume effect on the vector coupling (gV )lattice . This\nindicates that the observed finite volume effect in Fig. 4 stems from that of (gA )lattice . Clearly, it is observed that\n(gA )lattice decreases monotonically with decreasing spatial size L. Therefore, we simply utilize the power-law formula\nto estimate the infinite volume limit of the axial-vector coupling as\nlattice\nlattice\ngA\n(L) = gA\n(\u221e) + bL\u2212n\n\n(33)\n\nwith the power three (n = 3). Horizontal lines in figures represent the values in the infinite volume limit and their\none standard deviations. The values obtained from the largest volume, (3.6 fm)3 , are quite close to the values in the\ninfinite volume limit. At a glance, the spatial size over 2.5 fm is large enough to accurately calculate the axial-vector\ncoupling, at least within the range of our admitted quark mass.\nWe finally quote\nren\ngA\n= 1.219 \u00b1 0.038(stat) \u00b1 0.024(norm) \u00b1 0.002(volume),\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the second error is evaluated from a 2 % error stemming from ZV 6= ZA , which was observed previously [15]\nand the third error is estimated from a difference between the extrapolated value in the infinite volume limit and the\nlargest volume result at mf = 0.04.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS OF NUCLEON FORM FACTORS ON A (3.6 fm)3 VOLUME\n\nIn this section, we focus on the results obtained from lattice size 243 \u00d7 32, which corresponds to physical volume,\nV \u2248 (3.6fm)3 . The lower momentum is admitted by the larger spatial extent L. Therefore, we can make the shorter\nextrapolation with respect to q 2 toward the forward limit, q 2 = 0, for nucleon form factors, FT (q 2 ) and FP (q 2 ), of\nwhich values at q 2 = 0 cannot be accessible directly due to the kinematical constraint as described before. We also\ndiscuss the finite size effect on the nucleon form factors, which may be sensitive to the nucleon \"wave function\" or\nthe nucleon \"size\" squeezed due to the finite spatial extent of lattice volume. In the previous section, the spatial\nlattice-size dependence of the axial-vector coupling shows that spatial lattice size La \u2248 3.6 fm is large enough to avoid\nsignificant finite volume effect on gA .\n\n\f9\nA.\n\nVector channel\n\nIn the case if spatial momentum transfer q is non-zero, all three-point correlation functions defined in Eqs.(26) and\n(27) are calculable. Two independent form factors FV (q 2 ) and FT (q 2 ) are obtained by\nE \u2212 MN V\n2MN\n\u039bV0 +\n\u039b ,\nE + MN\nE + MN T\n\u0001\n1\nFT (q 2 ) =\n\u2212\u039bV0 + \u039bVT\nE + MN\n\nFV (q 2 ) =\n\nat finite q 2 .\n\n1.\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nDirac form factor FV (q 2 )\n\nFirst, we show quark mass dependence of the Dirac form factor FV (q 2 ). In Fig. 6, we plot the normalized FV (q 2 )\nby FV (0) as a function of four-momentum squared q 2 . Different symbols represent the values obtained from different\nquark masses mf . There is no large mf -dependence, while it seems that the smaller quark mass makes the q 2 dependence steeper. The Dirac form factor is supposed to be the dipole form at low q 2 :\nFV (q 2 ) =\n\nFV (0)\n,\n(1 + q 2 /MV2 )2\n\n(37)\n\nwhere MV denotes the dipole mass. A dashed curve in Fig. 6 corresponds to the dipole form with the empirical value\nof the dipole mass MV = 0.857(8) GeV, which is evaluated from the electric charge and magnetization radii of the\nproton and neutron as described in Appendix A.\nIn order to see how our measured FV (q 2 ) has an expected dipole form, we define the following quantity only at\nnonzero momentum:\ns\np\nq 2 FV (q 2 )\neff 2\np\nMV (q ) = p\n,\n(38)\nFV (0) \u2212 FV (q 2 )\n\nwhich should provide q 2 independent plateau if the q 2 -dependence of FV (q 2 ) ensures the dipole form. We call this\nquantity the effective dipole mass hereafter. In Fig. 7, we show the effective dipole-mass plot for the Dirac form\nfactor at mf = 0.02 as a typical example. Horizontal solid and dashed lines represent the fitted dipole mass obtained\nfrom a correlated fit to FV (q 2 ) using the dipole form (37) and its one standard deviation. The dotted lines shows\nthe empirical dipole mass, MV = 0.857(8) GeV. Clearly, there is no appreciable q 2 -dependence of the effective dipole\nmass within statistical errors. Even at the highest q 2 \u2248 0.44 GeV2 , the fitted dipole mass agrees with the value of the\neffective dipole mass. Therefore, we conclude that the dipole form describes well the q 2 -dependence of our measured\nDirac form factor FV (q 2 ). This observation is consistent with previous studies [2, 4].\nFig. 8 shows the quark-mass dependence of the fitted dipole mass. As seen from this figure, the quark-mass\ndependence is rather mild and then there is no appreciable curvature as a function of the pion mass squared. Therefore,\nwe simply adopt a linear extrapolation with respect to the pion mass squared to evaluate the value of the dipole mass\nof FV (q 2 ) in the chiral limit. Diamond symbols in Fig. 8 are extrapolated values for the chiral limit (m\u03c0 = 0) and the\nphysical point (m\u03c0 = 0.14 GeV) and the solid line represents the fitted line. Our measured dipole masses of the Dirac\nform factor are much larger than the experimental value.\nwe recall that the root mean-squared (rms) radii can\np Here \u221a\nbe determined with the corresponding dipole mass as hrV2 i = 12/MV . The larger dipole mass MV means that the\nspatial size of the nucleon in our simulations is smaller than the physical one. This may be attributed to the missing\nlarge \"pion-cloud\" contribution since it is well known that the mean-squared radius hrV2 i receives a large pion loop\ncorrection, which leads to a logarithmic divergence in the chiral limit in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory [46].\nIndeed, the present calculation is still far from the chiral regime: our smallest pion mass is around 0.39 GeV which\nis comparable to the lightest pion mass in the most recent lattice study of nucleon electro-magnetic form factors [4].\nAlthough the expected chiral behavior is not guaranteed in the quenched approximation, in the present study the\nestimation of systematic errors stemming from quenching and a long chiral extrapolation is beyond the scope of this\npaper. Rather we would like to see how large volume can be fitted for studying the structure of the nucleon, namely,\nthe nucleon form factors without significant finite volume effect. Studies of the finite size effect on the nucleon form\nfactors using results obtained from three different lattice sizes will be presented in the next section.\n\n\f10\n2.\n\nPauli form factor FT (q 2 )\n\nIn Fig. 9, we show the Pauli form factor F2 (q 2 ) = 2MN FT (q 2 ) as a function of four-momentum squared q 2 .\nThe form factor plotted here is scaled by the renormalization factor ZV = 1/FV (0) to get the renormalized one,\nF2ren (q 2 ) = ZV F2 (q 2 ). In contrast with Fig. 6, large mf -dependence is observed. As well as the Dirac form factor, the\nPauli form factor is phenomenologically supposed to be the dipole form at low q 2 :\nF2ren (q 2 ) =\n\nF2ren (0)\n,\n(1 + q 2 /MT2 )2\n\n(39)\n\nwhere the value of F2ren (q 2 ) at q 2 = 0 is associated with the difference of the proton and neutron magnetic moments,\n\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn = 1 + F2ren (0). This dipole form is commonly adopted as a fitting form of the q 2 extrapolation to evaluate\nF2ren (0) in published works [2, 4]. We also plot the dipole form with the empirical value of the Pauli dipole mass\nMT = 0.778(23) GeV and the experimental values of \u03bcp and \u03bcn in the same figure. Our results of F2ren (q 2 ) gradually\napproach this dipole form as mf decreases. Indeed, data points for mf = 0.02 in the range of our calculated q 2\nfollow the experimental curve within the statistical error. However, if we apply the dipole form to the data, our\nobtained values of F2ren (0) from dipole fits are somewhat underestimated in comparison with the experimental value\n\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn \u2212 1 = 3.70589 as shown in Fig. 10.\nIn contrast to the Dirac form factor, we cannot try the effective dipole mass plot for a justification of the applied\ndipole form, since we do not have data of F2ren (0) without the q 2 extrapolation. Instead, we consider an independent\nobservation for the difference of \u03bcp and \u03bcn , which can be derived from the forward limit of the ratio of the magnetic\nform factor GM (q 2 ) and the electric form factor GE (q 2 ). The ratio is calculated by a different combination of \u039bV0 and\n\u039bVT [43] as\n2\nGM (q 2 )\nGren\n\u039bVT\nM (q )\n=\n=\n.\n2\nGE (q 2 )\nGren\n\u039bV0\nE (q )\n\n(40)\n\nExperimentally, it is known that this ratio shows no q 2 -dependence at low q 2 since both form factors are well fitted by\nthe dipole form with the comparable dipole masses [8, 26]. Therefore, this ratio may yield the constant value identified\n2\nto \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn = Gren\nM (0). Indeed, in our calculation, the proposed ratio (40) exhibits no appreciable q -dependence in\n2\nthe range of our calculated q . We may use a simple linear fitting form with respect to four-momentum squared q 2\nfor an alternative evaluation of the value \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn . Fig. 10 shows that two determinations to evaluate \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn \u2212 1 are\nconsistent with each other.\nIn Fig. 11, we plot values of \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn , which are evaluated by two determinations, 1 + F2ren (0) and GM (0)/GE (0), as\na function of pion mass squared m2\u03c0 . As described above, both determinations fairly agree with each other. Although\nthe values measured at two heaviest points are consistent with the experimental one, a strong m2\u03c0 dependence appears\nnear the chiral limit and then the extrapolated value tends to somewhat underestimate the experimental data. Here,\nwe simply adopt a linear fit with respect to m2\u03c0 regardless of the fact that a slight downward curvature is observed in\nFig. 11.\nWe also extrapolate the Pauli dipole mass MT to the chiral limit in Fig. 12. Again, we use a simple linear fitting form\nfor the chiral extrapolation. The value obtained at the physical point is about a 20% overestimation in comparison\nwith the experimental one, the same as in the case of the Dirac dipole mass. This indicates that corresponding rms\nradii are somewhat smaller than the actual nucleon size. Finally, all fitted results with the dipole form for both form\nfactors and their extrapolated values to the chiral limit are summarized in Table VII.\nB.\n\nAxial-vector channel\n\nIn the axial-vector channel, two independent form factors FA (q 2 ) and FP (q 2 ) can be evaluated separately by\nFA (q 2 ) = \u039bA\nL (qz = 0),\n2\nA\nFP (q ) = \u039bT /MN\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\n2\nA\n2\nat finite q 2 . It should be reminded that \u039bA\nL (qz = 0) at n = 3 and \u039bT at n = 1, 4 are not obtained directly from\ncorresponding three-point functions due to the kinematics as described in the previous section. However, instead, we\ncan evaluate them by using a relation\nA\n\u039bA\nL (qz 6= 0) = \u039bL (qz = 0) \u2212\n2\nwhere \u039bA\nL (qz 6= 0) are always calculable at finite q .\n\nqz2\n\u039bA ,\nMN (E + MN ) T\n\n(43)\n\n\f11\n1.\n\nAxial-vector form factor FA (q 2 )\n\nFig. 13 shows quark mass dependence of the axial-vector form factor FA (q 2 ). The vertical axis is normalized by\nFA (0) and the horizontal axis denotes the four-momentum squared q 2 in physical units. Different symbols represent\nthe values obtained from different quark mass mf . The axial-vector form factor is phenomenologically fitted with the\ndipole form, at least at low q 2 , as well as the Dirac and Pauli form factors [9]:\nFA (q 2 ) =\n\nFA (0)\n,\n(1 + q 2 /MA2 )2\n\n(44)\n\nwhere MA denotes the axial dipole mass. A dashed curve in Fig. 13 shows the dipole form with an experimental value\nof the axial dipole mass MA = 1.026(21) GeV [9]. There is a similarity here in comparison with Fig. 6. No large\nmf -dependence is observed. Even at the smallest quark mass mf = 0.02, where the corresponding pion mass is less\nthan 400 MeV, our observed FA (q 2 ) is far from the experimental curve. Indeed, the axial-vector form factor FA (q 2 )\nis flatter than the experimental one, similar to what we observe in FV (q 2 ) and F2 (q 2 ) = 2MN FT (q 2 ). This again\nindicates that the nucleon size in coordinate space shrinks away. The similar observation is reported in Ref. [7].\nNext, to see how the dipole form is fitted to our measured FA (q 2 ), we show the effective dipole mass plot, which\nwas defined similarly to Eq.(38). Fig. 14 is plotted for mf = 0.02 as a typical example. We also include the fitted\nMA , which is obtained from a correlated fit to FA (q 2 ) using the dipole form (44), with its one standard deviation as\nsolid and dashed horizontal lines. All momentum points except the third one, which deviates from the fitted value\nby about 2\u03c3, are located within the horizontal lines. Here, we remark that the third momentum point of FA (q 2 ) at\nmf = 0.02 in Fig. 13 is slightly dropped from the values measured at other quark masses. We then stress that the\ncase of mf = 0.02 is the worst example. Indeed, it is found that the effective dipole mass plot for heavier mf are\nquite consistent with the fitted values in all q 2 range that we measured. From this observation, we conclude that the\nq 2 -dependence of our measured FA (q 2 ) can be well described by the dipole form (44) in the range of our utilized q 2 ,\n(q 2 \u2264 0.44 GeV2 ). This is quite consistent with the phenomenological knowledge on the q 2 -dependence of FA (q 2 ).\nWe show the quark-mass dependence of the fitted axial dipole mass as a function of the pion mass squared in\nFig. 15. All measured values are listed in Table VIII. We find that the quark-mass dependence is somewhat milder\nthan the dipole masses for the Dirac and Pauli form factors. Clearly, there is no appreciable curvature as a function\nof the pion mass squared. As before, we simply adopt a linear extrapolation for the axial dipole mass MA toward the\nchiral limit. The extrapolated values (diamond symbols) overestimate the experimental one marked by the asterisk\nin Fig. 15.\nAs pointed out before, our observed \"size\" of the nucleon in coordinate space is much smaller than the experimental\none. We will see that there is no significant finite volume effect, which may cause the \"size\" of the nucleon to be\nsqueezed on the lattice with (3.6 fm)3 volume. Thus, this observed \"squeezing\", which is evident from the broadening\nof the form factors, may be attributed to the missing contribution of the \"pion-cloud\" surrounding the nucleon outside\nof the chiral regime. Interestingly, however, the ratio of the axial dipole mass to the Dirac dipole mass is in very good\nagreement with the experiment. In Fig 16, we show the ratio MA /MV together with the ratio MT /MV as a function\nof the pion mass squared. The quark mass dependence of both ratios is found to be very mild in our observed range\nof m2\u03c0 . All measured values of MA /MV and MT /MV , which are listed in Table IX, are fairly comparable to their\nrespective experimental values. We obtain MA /MV = 1.285(73) and MT /MV = 0.869(57) at the physical point by\nusing a simple linear extrapolation.\n2.\n\nInduced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 )\n\nFirst, we show the quark-mass dependence of the induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ) in Fig. 17. In contrast to\nthe axial-vector form factor FA (q 2 ), significant mf -dependence is observed especially in the lower q 2 region (q 2 < 0.3\nGeV2 ). This might be associated with the pion-pole contribution to FP (q 2 ), which is expected theoretically. Indeed,\nthe partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis and pion-pole dominance (PPD) predict that the\ninduced pseudo-scalar form factor approximately behaves like\nFPPPD (q 2 ) =\n\n2MN FAren (q 2 )\n,\nq 2 + m2\u03c0\n\n(45)\n\nwhich becomes exact in the chiral limit where the pion is massless (m\u03c0 = 0) [8, 35]. The single pion electroproduction\nexperiment also supports the PPD form [12]. Here, to see how the pion-pole behavior is preserved in FP (q 2 ) measured\n\n\f12\nin the quenched calculation, we consider the following ratio\n\u03b1PPD =\n\nFPren (q 2 )\n,\nFPPPD (q 2 )\n\n(46)\n\nwhich is inspired by the above PCAC prediction. If the measured FP (q 2 ) has exactly the same form described in\nEq.(45), the ratio \u03b1PPD yields the value of unity in the entire q 2 region.\nIn Fig. 18, we plot the above defined ratio \u03b1PPD as a function of four-momentum squared q 2 . This figure shows\ntwo important features. The significant quark-mass dependence observed in Fig. 17 almost disappears as expected.\nFurthermore, there is no appreciable q 2 -dependence in \u03b1PPD . Clearly, four different q 2 points of \u03b1PPD reveal q 2\nindependent plateau within the statistical errors. We simply take the weighted average of \u03b1PPD within four measured\nq 2 points, then plot them against the pion mass squared. As shown in Fig. 19, the average values of \u03b1PPD gradually\napproach unity as the pion mass decreases. However, a simple linear extrapolation of \u03b1PPD yields a value slightly\nsmaller than 1 even in the chiral limit. As a result, measured FPren (q 2 ) is quit well described by the PPD form with a\nmultiplicative (quenching) factor \u03b1PPD < 1.\nFPren (q 2 ) \u2248 \u03b1PPD \u00d7 FPPPD (q 2 ).\n\n(47)\n\nThe validity of the PPD form is also tested by the other analysis. Following the analysis done in the previous study of\nthe q 2 -dependence of FP (q 2 ) [7], we apply the monopole fit to the ratio FP (q 2 )/FA (q 2 ). The satisfactory consistency\nbetween the fitted monopole mass and the measured pion mass is observed in our DWF calculation [58], while both\nquenched and unquenched Wilson simulations fail to exhibit the correct pion-pole structure of FP (q 2 ) [7].\nNext, we evaluate the induced pseudo-scalar coupling, which is defined by (gP )ren = m\u03bc FPren (0.88m2\u03bc ) where m\u03bc is\nthe muon rest mass and FPren (q 2 ) = FP (q 2 )/FV (0). The specific momentum transfer for muon capture (q 2 = 0.88m2\u03bc )\nis still far from our lowest momentum transfer (q 2 \u2248 0.1 GeV2 ) so that the determination of (gP )ren requires the q 2\nextrapolation of FPren (q 2 ). We have already learned that the q 2 -dependence of measured FPren (q 2 ) is well described by\nthe PPD-like form (47) in the low q 2 region. Therefore, the induced pseudo-scalar coupling can be evaluated by\n(gP )ren =\n\n2m\u03bc MN\n\u00d7 \u03b1PPD FAren (0.88m2\u03bc ),\n+ 0.88m2\u03bc\n\nm2\u03c0\n\n(48)\n\nwhere FAren (0.88m2\u03bc ) is precisely determined through the q 2 interpolation with the help of the dipole form and very\naccurate data FAren (0). The pion mass in Eq.(48) is simply replaced by its physical value in order to subtract the\ndominant source of the large mf -dependence. In Fig. 20, we plot the resulting value of (gP )ren (square symbols) as\na function of the pion mass squared. All measured values are listed in Table VIII. Although there still remains the\nexplicit dependence of the quark mass, the simple linear extrapolation yields (gP )ren = 8.15 \u00b1 0.54 at the physical\npoint (m\u03c0 = 0.14 GeV).\nHere, the observed mf -dependence stems from that of measured MN , since both \u03b1PPD and FAren (q 2 ) have a very\nmild quark mass dependence. To diminish the explicit mf -dependence, we may evaluate the dimensionless prefactor\nin Eq.(48) with the experimental values of m\u03bc = 105.7 MeV, m\u03c0 = 139.6 MeV and MN = 938.9 MeV instead of\nusing measured values. We then obtain a more simple form as (gP )ren = 6.77 \u00d7 \u03b1PPD FAren (0.88m2\u03bc ), which is similar to\nthe known phenomenological form for gP beside the quenching factor \u03b1PPD [10]. Indeed, evaluated values using this\nsimple formula have no appreciable mf dependence as shown in Fig. 20. After the linear extrapolation, we obtained\n(gP )ren = 7.31 \u00b1 0.39 at the physical point. Two determinations provide consistent results within their statistical\nerrors. Of course, the latter determination is rather phenomenological, then we prefer to quote the former value for\nour final result. We finally quote\n(gP )ren = 8.15 \u00b1 0.54(stat) \u00b1 0.16(norm),\n\n(49)\n\nwhere the second error is an estimate of a 2% error stemming from ZV 6= ZA , the same as in the axial-vector coupling\ngA .\nThis value is to be compared with the most recent experimental value gPexp = 7.3 \u00b1 1.1 from the MuCap experiment [11], where the obtained value of gPexp is nearly independent of \u03bc-molecular effects. We also quote the prediction of\nchiral perturbation theory, gPChPT = 8.26 \u00b1 0.23 and the new world average of experimental values, gPexp = 8.7 \u00b1 1.0 [33]\nobtained from ordinary muon capture including the new MuCap result.\nPhenomenologically, the residue of the pion pole in the induced pseudo-scalar form factor is related to the pionnucleon coupling g\u03c0N N [35]. The induced pseudo-scalar form factor should be expressed as\nFPren (q 2 ) \u2243\n\n2F\u03c0 g\u03c0N N\nq 2 + m2\u03c0\n\n(50)\n\n\f13\nnear the pion pole (q 2 \u2248 \u2212m2\u03c0 ) [8, 35] with the renormalized pion decay constant F\u03c0 , which is defined as\nZA h0|\u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 (x)|\u03c0b (q)i = m2\u03c0 F\u03c0 \u03b4ab eiq*x [59]. This parameterization provides a way to evaluate the pion-nucleon coupling g\u03c0N N from the measured induced pseudo-scalar form factor as follows:\ng\u03c0N N =\n=\n\nlim\n2\n\n(q 2 + m2\u03c0 )\n2\n\nq \u2192\u2212m\u03c0\n\nFPren (q 2 )\n2F\u03c0\n\n\u03b1PPD\n\u00d7 MN FAren (\u2212m2\u03c0 ),\nF\u03c0\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nwhere the second equality follows from our observed form (47) on FPren (q 2 ). The value of FAren (\u2212m2\u03c0 ) is evaluated by\nthe dipole form with measured FAren (0), MA and m\u03c0 . We then obtain\ng\u03c0N N = 10.4 \u00b1 1.0(stat)\n\n(53)\n\nat the physical point. Our obtained value is about 20% smaller that a recent estimation g\u03c0N N = 13.32 \u00b1 0.09\n2\n(g\u03c0N\nN /4\u03c0 = 14.11 \u00b1 0.20) obtained from forward \u03c0N scattering data [47].\nC.\n1.\n\nPseudo-scalar channel\n\nPseudo-scalar form factor GP (q 2 )\n\nIn this study, we also calculate the pseudo-scalar nucleon matrix element\nhN (P \u2032 )|P a (x)|N (P )i = uN (P \u2032 )OP (q)ta uN (P )eiq*x ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhich is associated with the axial-vector matrix element through the axial Ward-Takahashi identity. Here, P a (x) is\na local pseudo-scalar density, P a (x) \u2261 \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b35 ta \u03c8(x). The pseudo-scalar matrix element can be described only by a\nsingle form factor, which is called the pseudo-scalar form factor GP (q 2 ):\nOP (q) = \u03b35 GP (q 2 ).\n\n(55)\n\nTo extract the form factor, therefore, we simply calculate the following trace of G P (q), which represents the spinor\nstructure of the corresponding three-point function, with the projection operator P5z :\n1 \b z P\nTr P5 G (q) = iqz MN GP (q 2 ),\n4\n\n(56)\n\n \u0304\nwhere the definition of G P (q) is given by Eqs. (21) and (22) with the local current J5P (x) = \u016b(x)\u03b35 u(x) \u2212 d(x)\u03b3\n5 d(x).\nIt is apparent that non-zero three-momentum q 6= 0 is required to access the pseudo-scalar form factor. In other\nwords, GP (q 2 ) in the vicinity of q 2 = 0 cannot be evaluated without q 2 extrapolation.\nIn Fig. 21, we show the mf -dependence of the pseudo-scalar form factor GP (q 2 ). Significant mf -dependence is\nobserved in the lower q 2 region, similar to the induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ). We will discuss the q 2 dependence on GP (q 2 ) from the viewpoint of pion-pole dominance later.\n2.\n\nTest for the axial Ward-Takahashi identity\n\nFirst, we address the question whether our domain wall fermion (DWF) calculations of nucleon form factors satisfy\nthe axial Ward-Takahashi identity. A similar study has been recently done with the Wilson fermions in both quenched\nand unquenched simulations [7].\nIn the limit where the fifth-dimensional extent Ls is taken to infinity, domain wall fermions preserve the axial\nWard-Takahashi identity at nonzero lattice spacing [18]. The axial Ward-Takahashi identity for the DWF with SU (2)\niso-spin symmetry is\na\n(x),\n\u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bc (x) = 2mf J5a (x) + 2J5q\n\n(57)\n\nwhere Aa\u03bc is the partially-conserved axial-vector current, which is point split and requires sums over the extra fifth\na\ndimension of the DWF, J5a is a usual bilinear pseudo-scalar density corresponding to P a , and J5q\nis a similar pseudoa\nscalar density defined at the midpoint of the fifth dimension. The \"midpoint\" term J5q is responsible for the explicit\n\n\f14\nchiral symmetry breaking due to the finiteness of the fifth-dimension [18]. With moderate Ls , this effect can be\ndescribed by the so-called residual mass term mres . Then, Eq.(57) can be approximately represented by\n\u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 (x) \u2248 2(mf + mres )P a (x).\n\n(58)\n\na\nThis residual mass mres is determined by h0|J5q\n|\u03c0i/h0|J5a |\u03c0i. The value of mres is known to be small in this calculation.\n(See Table IV.)\nFor a practical reason, we did not use the conserved axial-vector current for evaluating the nucleon axial matrix\nelement in this study. Instead, we use the local axial-vector current Aa\u03bc = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 ta \u03c8, which may be related to the\nconserved axial-vector current as A\u03bc = ZA A\u03bc + O(a2 , mf a2 ). It is worth mentioning that ZV = ZA is satisfied up to\nsmall discretization errors of O(a2 ) in the chiral limit [15]. We also did not measure the nucleon matrix element of\na\nJ5q\n, therefore we cannot fully check the axial Ward-Takahashi identity (AWT) in terms of the nucleon matrix element\nin this paper. Instead, we test the following ratio, which may have no apparent q 2 -dependence.\n\n\u03b1AWT =\n\n2MN FAren (q 2 ) \u2212 q 2 FPren (q 2 )\n,\n2mf GP (q 2 )\n\n(59)\n\nThis ratio (59) is associated with the following identity [60]:\nZA hN |\u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 (x)|N i = 2mAWT hN |P a (x)|N i,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere mAWT \u2261 \u03b1AWT mf , which is expected to be comparable to mf + mres up to terms of order O(a2 , mf a2 ).\nAs shown in Fig.22, indeed, there is no appreciable q 2 -dependence in the ratio \u03b1AWT for each mf . Four different\n2\nq points of \u03b1AWT reveal a q 2 -independent plateau within the statistical errors. We evaluate the weighted average of\n\u03b1AWT by using all four measured q 2 points. The obtained values of \u03b1AWT are tabulated in Table X. Deviation from\nunity is getting large as mf decreases [61]. This indicates that \u03b1AWT may possess a 1/mf term, which is induced by\nthe presence of the additive mass shift in the axial Ward-Takahashi identity such as mres . To see this point clearly, we\nplot the modified ratio as mf (\u03b1AWT \u2212 1), which can be interpreted as the difference between mAWT and mf . Fig. 23\nshows modified ratios as functions of four-momentum squared q 2 for all four values of mf . There is again no visible\nq 2 dependence. Moreover, all mf results are consistent with each other within statistical errors. mshift \u2261 mAWT \u2212 mf ,\nwhich is given by taking the weighted average of four q 2 points in Fig. 23, corresponds to the relative amplitude of\na\nhN |J5q\n|N i to the usual pseudo-scalar matrix element hN |J5a |N i. More precisely, mshift is expressed by\nmshift =\n\na\nhN |J5q\n|N i\n+ O(a2 , mf a2 ).\na\nhN |J5 |N i\n\n(61)\n\na\na\nTherefore, supposing that hN |J5q\n|N i/hN |J5a |N i \u2248 h0|J5q\n|\u03c0i/h0|J5a |\u03c0i, we expect mshift \u2248 mres besides O(a2 , mf a2 )\ncorrections. We plot mshift against the pion mass squared in Fig. 24. The mild mf -dependence allows us to take\na linear extrapolation for mshift to the chiral limit. At mf = 0, we obtain mshift = 0.0073(12), which is about one\norder of magnitude larger than mres = 5.69(26) \u00d7 10\u22124 [20] contrary to our naive expectation. A few % level O(a2 )\ncorrection, which is observed in the difference between ZV and ZA cannot account for this discrepancy. To resolve it,\na\nit is necessary to calculate the relative amplitude of hN |J5q\n|N i to the usual pseudo-scalar matrix element hN |J5a |N i\na\na\ndirectly. We plan to study hN |J5q |N i as well as hN |A\u03b1 |N i with the conserved axial-vector current A\u03b1 in our extended\nwork [48].\n\n3.\n\nTest for the pion-pole dominance on GP (q 2 )\n\nAccording to the pion-pole dominance of FP (q 2 ), we may expect that the pion-pole dominance holds even in GP (q 2 ).\nAs described in Appendix B, a naive pion-pole dominance hypothesis predicts the ratio of the pseudo-scalar form\nfactor and induced pseudo-scalar form factor, will not depend on q 2 at low q 2 but will exhibit a constant value, related\nto the low energy constant B0 . Indeed, this is not the case. In Fig. 25, we show the ratio of our measured GP (q 2 )\nand FP (q 2 ) as a function of momentum squared q 2 . There is a linear-like q 2 dependence, which strengthens as the\nquark mass decreases. However, as we will describe below, we confirm that the pion-pole dominance on GP (q 2 ) still\nremains valid in our calculation.\nWhat we have observed in the previous subsection can be interpreted as a consequence of the axial Ward-Takahashi\nidentity among three nucleon form factors:\n2MN FAren (q 2 ) \u2212 q 2 FPren (q 2 ) \u2248 2mAWT GP (q 2 ).\n\n(62)\n\n\f15\nCombined with this relation and the important observation of pion-pole dominance in FP (q 2 ) (Eq.(47)), one may expect that the q 2 -dependence of GP (q 2 ) is mostly described by the pion-pole dominance form with a slight modification,\nwhich corresponds to an extra q 2 -dependence caused by the fact that \u03b1PPD 6= 1:\n2\n\n2\n\nGP (q ) \u2248\n\nq\n1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1PPD ) m\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03b1AWT\n\n\u00d7 GPPD\n(q 2 ),\nP\n\n(63)\n\nwhere the naive pion-pole dominance form [49] is defined as\n2mf GPPD\n(q 2 ) = 2MN FAren (q 2 )\nP\n\nq2\n\nm2\u03c0\n.\n+ m2\u03c0\n\n(64)\n\nThis residual q 2 -dependence due to \u03b1PPD 6= 1 is supposed to be responsible for the q 2 -dependence in the ratio of our\nmeasured GP (q 2 ) and FPren (q 2 )\n2\n\nq\nPPD 2\n1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1PPD ) m\n2 G\nm2\u03c0\nGP (q 2 )\n(q )\n2\nP\n\u03c0\n=\n\u2206\n(q\n)\n,\n\u2248\nPPD\nren\nFP (q 2 )\n\u03b1PPD \u03b1AWT\n2mAWT\nFPPPD (q 2 )\n\n(65)\n\n2\n\nq\n2\n2\nwhere \u2206PPD (q 2 ) \u2261 (1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1PPD ) m\n2 )/\u03b1PPD . It is clear that the residual q -dependence becomes large as m\u03c0 goes\n\u03c0\nto zero. This feature is in agreement with what we observe in Fig.25. If we multiply the ratio by the corresponding\nfactor \u2206PPD (q 2 ), which is evaluated with measured \u03b1PPD and m\u03c0 , the linear-like q 2 -dependence indeed disappears as\nindicated in Fig.26. Four different q 2 points of this ratio reveal q 2 independent plateau within their statistical errors.\nWe then can evaluate the weighted average by using all four measured q 2 points to obtain the value of GP (q 2 )/FPren (q 2 )\nin the limit of q 2 \u2192 0, which corresponds to m2\u03c0 /(2mAWT \u03b1PPD ).\nAlthough GP (0)/FPren (0) is associated with the bare value of the low-energy constant B0 in the pion-pole dominance\nmodel as discussed in Appendix B, this prediction is slightly modified as\n\nGP (q 2 )\n1 mf + mres\nB0 ,\n=\nren\n2\n\u21920 FP (q )\n\u03b1PPD mf + mshift\n\nlim\n2\n\nq\n\n(66)\n\nwhere the low-energy constant B0 is defined by the relation m2\u03c0 = 2(mf + mres )B0 . Because of the fact that\nmres 6= mshift , the values of GP (0)/FPren(0) \u00d7 \u03b1PPD deviate from B0 as shown in Fig. 27. The horizontal solid and\ndashed lines represent the reference value of B0 and its standard deviation, which are evaluated from fitting squared\npion masses to the linear function c0 + c1 * mf . The fit yields the low-energy constant B0 = c1 /2 = 2.0705(93) in\nlattice units. The ratio of fitting parameters c0 and c1 gives rise to the value of 1.75(15) \u00d7 10\u22123 , which slightly\noverestimates mres quoted in Ref. [20]. This is simply because our fitting is performed in the rather heavier quark\nmass region (0.02 \u2264 mf \u2264 0.08). For comparison, values of m2\u03c0 /2mf and m2\u03c0 /2(mf + mres ) are also plotted as square\nand circle symbols in Fig. 27. This observation may raise a question whether the single universal \"residual mass\"\nparameter exists. However, what we observe here is very sensitive to the correct chiral behavior of the nucleon matrix\nelements. The quenched approximation may provide unknown quenching effects in nucleon matrix elements near the\nchiral limit. In this sense, dynamical simulations are much preferable to investigate it further.\nV.\n\nFINITE VOLUME EFFECT ON NUCLEON FORM FACTORS\n\nAs we discussed in Sec. III C, we have found a significant finite volume effect on the axial-vector coupling gA , while\nthere is no appreciable effect on the vector-coupling gV . In this section, we test for finite volume effects on all of the\nfive nucleon form factors computed in this study. Unlike those couplings gV and gA , which are defined at q 2 = 0, it\nis hard to compare values of the form factor at non-zero q 2 among different spatial sizes L. This is simply because\nnon-zero q 2 values are discrete in units of (2\u03c0/L)2 . In this study, however, our largest spatial size (L = 24) is twice as\n2\u03c0\nlarge as the smallest one (L = 12). The q 2 value for q = 2\u03c0\nL (2, 0, 0) at L = 24 coincides with the one for q = L (1, 0, 0)\n2\nat L = 12. Therefore, at least, a single value of non-zero q is common between two different lattice sizes.\nIn Fig. 28, we show results for the vector form factor FV (q 2 ) for three spatial sizes. The left (right) panel is for\nmf = 0.04 (mf = 0.08). Different symbols represent the values obtained from simulations with different spatial lattice\nsizes. Solid curves are dipole form fits results on the largest volume (L = 24) as we described in Sec.IV A 1. These\ncurves should be capable of exposing finite volume effects on the form factor. Data points from smaller lattice sizes of\neither L = 16 or L = 12 at heavier mf agree well with the dipole fits, while results obtained from the smallest lattice\n\n\f16\n(L = 12) at lighter mf seem to be slightly away from them. However, the values obtained from L = 24 and L = 12\nat q 2 \u2248 0.44 GeV are not significantly different in the statistical sense.\nWe next show the same type of figures for the induced tensor form factor FT (q 2 ) in Fig. 29. Qualitative features are\nquite similar to the case of the vector form factor. In the case of the heavier quark mass (mf = 0.08), all data points\nfollow the solid curve fairly well, which is the dipole form fitted to the data of the largest volume (L = 24). On the\nother hand, at lighter quark mass (mf = 0.04), the data points obtained from the smallest lattice volume (L = 12)\nslightly overestimate the solid curve. Again, the value for L = 12 at q 2 \u2248 0.44 GeV2 is not significantly away from\nthe value for L = 24 in the statistical sense.\nNext, let us examine two form factors in the axial-vector channel, where the axial-vector coupling gA significantly\nsuffers from the finite volume effect. In Fig. 30, the axial-vector form factor FA (q 2 )/FA (0) for three spatial sizes is\nshown. Gross features are mostly similar to both the vector form factor and the induced tensor form factor. At the\nheavier quark mass, it is observed that all data points follow the solid curve fitted to data of the largest volume with\nthe dipole form (44). Although two values at q 2 \u2248 0.44 GeV2 obtained from both largest and smallest volumes agree\neach other within statistical errors, the finite volume effect seems to be non-negligible in the lighter quark mass region.\nOn the other hand, the finite volume effects do not show up in the induced pseudo-scalar form factor except for the\nlowest q 2 value for L = 16, as indicated in Fig. 31. The solid curves are obtained by fitting data of the largest volume\nwith the PPD-like form (47), where the pion-pole structure is essential at low q 2 . At this moment, we do not have\nany explanation why the lowest q 2 data for L = 16 deviates from the solid curve. We also show the form factor in the\npseudo-scalar channel, namely GP (q 2 ), for three lattice sizes in Fig. 32. At either quark mass mf = 0.04 or 0.08, all\ndata points agree well with the solid curves fitted to data of the largest volume by the modified PPD form (63). All\ndata that appear in Fig. 28-32 are tabulated in Tables XI-XIII.\nAlthough we may observe the common tendency that the three form factors FV (q 2 ), FT (q 2 ) and FA (q 2 ) become\nflatter as a function of q 2 in the smallest volume (L = 12), we do not make a definite conclusion through this study.\nRather we can say that the finite volume effects on the values of any form factor at finite q 2 are less appreciable than\nour expectation raised by the fact that the axial-vector coupling significantly suffers from the finite volume effect.\nIndeed, we could attempt the direct comparison between results for two lattice sizes only at q 2 \u2248 0.44 GeV2 , which\nis a relatively high value. Therefore, we deduce that the finite volume effects are not so serious in the high q 2 region.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that we confirm that our observed forms for the five form factors well describe the\nq 2 -dependence of those form factors even in the relatively high q 2 region, up to at least q 2 \u2248 1.0 GeV2 , apart from\nconsideration of finite volume effects.\nVI.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS\n\nAs we discussed in Sec. IV, the larger spatial volume enables us to perform the shorter q 2 -extrapolation to extract\nfundamental information on the nucleon structure, e.g. the magnetic moment, the charge radius and the induced\npseudo-scalar coupling from respective form factors without large systematic uncertainties. However, some of previous\nstudies are performed on relatively small volumes, where the longer q 2 -extrapolation is inevitable. In this context,\nour lattice setup is superior to previous studies. (See Table XIV for a summary of previous calculations [2, 4, 5, 7].)\nA large volume simulation, which is comparable to our lattice volume, (3.6 fm)3 , has been done by the LHPC\nCollaboration with the mixed action simulation using DWF valence quarks on the asqtad-improved gauge configurations with fourth-rooted staggered sea quarks. The quenching effect in our simulations could be observed through a\ncomparison with the mixed action results. However, there is no detailed analysis of the usual form factors in Ref [5].\nInstead, we can access their raw data of four nucleon form factors from their tables. We simply compare our measured\nform factors at the lightest quark mass (m\u03c0 =0.39 GeV) with their results with the lightest pion mass of 0.35 GeV\nand the largest volume of (3.5 fm)3 in Fig. 33. Surprisingly, all figures for four form factors show good consistency\nbetween our quenched results and the LHPC mixed action results within statistical errors, at least, in the low q 2\nregion. This indicates that (un)quenching effects on these form factors are still small for m\u03c0 >\n\u223c 0.35 GeV. However,\nthis conclusion is rather premature since the mixed action simulation is not a fully dynamical simulation, rather a\npartially quenched simulation [51]. We must wait for fully dynamical DWF simulation to make a firm conclusion.\nThe RBC and UKQCD Collaborations have begun 2+1 flavor DWF calculations with large physical volume [52, 53].\nWe will do such a comparison in a future publication.\nFinally, it is worth comparing our DWF results with the results obtained using Wilson fermions. In Table XV, our\nresults of the axial-vector coupling gA and the rms radii of the iso-vector Dirac and Pauli form factors, the iso-vector\nnucleon magnetic moment \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn , the axial dipole mass, the induced pseudo-scalar coupling gP and the pion-nucleon\ncoupling g\u03c0N N in the chiral limit are compared with previous quenched Wilson results from Refs. [4] and [7]. Their\nlightest pion mass of 0.41 GeV and physical volume of (2.9 fm)3 are relatively similar to our lattice set up. One finds\nthat the rms radii and the axial dipole mass are quite consistent with each other, while the better agreement with the\n\n\f17\nexperiment for the axial-vector coupling and the iso-vector nucleon magnetic moment appear in our quenched DWF\nresults. Note that although the induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ) was calculated in Ref. [7], the value of the\ninduced pseudo-scalar coupling gP was not evaluated there.\nLet us estimate gP from their fit parameters given in Table III of Ref. [7] as follows. First we read off \u03b1PPD from their\nparameters obtained by the monopole fit c0 /(1+q 2 /\u039b2 ) to the ratio of 2MN FP (q 2 )/FA (q 2 ). The authors reported that\n2\nthe monopole mass \u039b is larger than their measured pion mass, while the value of c0 is smaller than 4MN\n/m2\u03c0 evaluated\nby the measured pion and nucleon masses. Therefore, their \u03b1PPD may have appreciable q 2 -dependence, which is given\n2\nby (1 + q 2 /m2\u03c0 )/(1 + q 2 /\u039b2 ). On the other hand, the value of \u03b1PPD at q 2 = 0 can be given by c0 m2\u03c0 /(4MN\n), which\nis ranged from 0.68 to 0.62 when the pion mass vary from 0.56 GeV to 0.41 GeV. There is the descending tendency\nwith the decrease of the pion mass. A simple linear extrapolation with respect to the pion mass squared leads to a\nvalue in the chiral limit less than 0.6, that is significantly deviated from unity. Thus, one may easily deduce that\ntheir gP should be much smaller than our observed gP since their corresponding \u03b1PPD and measured FA (0), both of\nwhich are main ingredients in Eq. (48), are about 40% and 20% smaller than our DWF values respectively. Indeed,\nour quoted gP of the quenched Wilson results in Table XV, which is determined with the value of \u03b1PPD evaluated at\nq 2 = 0.88m2\u03bc , is almost a half of our quenched DWF value. This discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the Wilson\nfermions do not yield the correct pion-pole structure of FP (q 2 ) [7], while the PPD form provides a good description\nof the q 2 -dependence of FP (q 2 ) at low q 2 in our DWF calculation.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the weak nucleon form factors at low q 2 in quenched lattice QCD. We have used\ndomain wall fermions in a very large physical volume (3.6 fm)3 . There are two reasons for requiring such large\nvolume. As shown in the early calculation of the axial-vector coupling gA [15], the nucleon matrix element may suffer\nsignificantly large finite volume effects. However, we really did not know whether the spatial volume (2.4 fm)3 , that\nwas utilized in Ref. [15], was large enough for the nucleon. Secondly, the large spatial extent provides the capability\nto access lower non-zero momentum transfer. For the spatial volume (3.6 fm)3 , the smallest value of non-zero q 2 is\nabout 0.1 GeV2 .\nWe first demonstrated that the finite volume effect on the axial-vector coupling gA is well described by the powerlaw behavior, while the vector coupling gV has no appreciable finite volume effect. However, it is found that a serious\nfinite volume effect on the axial-vector coupling gA is not seen in the range of the spatial lattice size from 2.4 fm to\n3.6 fm. Finally, we obtain the ratio of the axial-vector to the vector coupling (gA /gV )ren = 1.219 \u00b1 0.038(stat) \u00b1\n0.024(norm) \u00b1 0.002(vol) at the physical point from the largest volume (3.6 fm)3 , which agrees with our early estimate\nfrom the volume (2.4 fm)3 [15] and underestimates the experimental value of 1.2695(29) by less than 5%.\nUsing the largest volume (3.6 fm)3 , we studied four of the weak nucleon form factors and also the pseudo-scalar form\nfactor. The q 2 -dependences of all measured form factors at low q 2 are discussed with great interest [62]. It is observed\nthat the vector (FV ), induced tensor (FT ) and the axial-vector (FA ) form factors are well described by the dipole form\nas Fi (q 2 ) = Fi (0)/(1 + q 2 /Mi2 ) (i = V, T, A) at low q 2 (q 2 < 0.44 GeV2 ). Each measured dipole mass overestimates\nthe corresponding experimental value by about 20 %. This fact indicates that corresponding rms radii are somewhat\nsmaller than the actual nucleon size. However, interestingly, the ratios of dipole masses, MA /MV = 1.285 \u00b1 0.073 and\nMT /MV = 0.869 \u00b1 0.057 are fairly consistent with respective experimental ones. We also calculated the difference of\nthe proton and neutron magnetic moments, \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn = 4.13 \u00b1 0.23, from the value of FT (q 2 ) at q 2 = 0. Our obtained\nvalue is about 14% smaller than experimental value of 4.70589.\nWe have presented a detailed study of the induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ), which is less well-known\nexperimentally. It is observed that the q 2 -dependence of FP (q 2 ) exhibits the strong quark-mass dependence in the\nlow q 2 region. This is associated with the pion-pole contribution. Indeed, we confirm that the measured value of FP (q 2 )\nis well described by the pion-pole dominance (PPD) form FPPPD (q 2 ) = 2MN FA (q 2 )/(q 2 + m2\u03c0 ) with a multiplicative\nfactor \u03b1PPD (< 1). With the help of such the PPD-like form, we can evaluate the induced pseudo-scalar coupling as\n(gP )ren = 8.15 \u00b1 0.54(stat) \u00b1 0.16(norm). This value is to be compared with the most recent experimental value of\n7.3 \u00b1 1.1 from the MuCap experiment. Furthermore, we evaluated the pion-nucleon coupling g\u03c0N N from the residue\nof the pion pole in the induced pseudo-scalar form factor and found g\u03c0N N = 10.4 \u00b1 1.0(stat).\nWe have also studied the axial Ward-Takahashi identity in terms of the nucleon matrix elements, which may be\nreferred to as the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation. For this purpose, we also calculated the pseudo-scalar\nmatrix element, which is described by the single form factor called as the pseudo-scalar form factor GP (q 2 ). We\nhave found that the measured q 2 -dependence of GP (q 2 ) is quite consistent with an expected behavior associated\nwith FA (q 2 ) and FP (q 2 ) in consequence of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity, or the generalized Goldberger-Treiman\nrelation. This fact ensures that the PPD form provides a good description of the q 2 -dependence of GP (q 2 ) as well.\nIn the case of large but finite fifth dimension, the axial Ward-Takahashi identity for domain wall fermions can be\n\n\f18\nslightly modified by introducing an additive shift of the quark mass due to the presence of the midpoint contribution\nto the divergence of the axial-vector current. Such an additive constant shift known as the residual quark mass\nis usually measured through mesonic two-point correlation functions. In an earlier calculation, the residual quark\nmass is observed much smaller than the lightest quark mass utilized here [20]. However, our observed quark mass\nshift mshift , which is required for satisfaction of the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation, is close to 50% of our\nlightest quark mass and an order of magnitude larger than the residual mass quoted in Ref. [20]. This issue may be\nconnected with the correct chiral behavior of the nucleon matrix elements. In the quenched approximation, there may\nbe unknown quenching effects in nucleon matrix elements in the vicinity of the chiral limit. In this context, the above\nissue is beyond the scope of this quenched study. Rather, dynamical simulations are much preferable to investigate it\nfurther. The RBC and UKQCD Collaborations have begun Nf = 2 + 1 flavor domain wall fermion calculations with\nlarge physical volume V \u2248 (2.7 fm)3 and the lightest ud quark mass down to 1/7 the strange quark mass (m\u03c0 \u2248 330\nMeV) [52]. We plan to develop the present calculation for a precise determination of nucleon form factors and also to\naddress all of unsolved issues described in this paper. Such planning is now underway [53].\nNote added: After the completion of this work, we became aware of a paper [7] where the nucleon axial-vector\nform factor FA (q 2 ) and induced pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ) are calculated in quenched and unquenched lattice\nQCD using Wilson fermions.\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge S.

Using these\nexperimental values, the iso-vector electric charge and iso-vector magnetization radii can be evaluated by the following\nrelations [4, 8]\nv 2\nh(rE\n) i \u2261 \u22126\nv 2\nh(rM\n) i \u2261 \u22126\n\n1\nGvE (q 2 )\n\ndGvE (q 2 )\ndq 2\n\ndGvM (q 2 )\n1\nGvM (q 2 ) dq 2\n\nq2 =0\n\np 2\nn 2\n= h(rE\n) i \u2212 h(rE\n) i,\n\n=\nq2 =0\n\n\u03bcp p 2\n\u03bcn n 2\nh(rM ) i \u2212\nh(r ) i,\n\u03bcv\n\u03bcv M\n\n(67)\n(68)\n\np v\nwhere GvE(M) (q 2 ) = GpE(M) (q 2 ) \u2212 GnE(M) (q 2 ) and \u03bcv = \u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn . Then one obtains h(rE\n)2 i = 0.939(5) fm and\np v\nh(rM )2 i = 0.862(14) fm. Similarly, the rms radii for the iso-vector Dirac form factor F1v (q 2 ) = F1p (q 2 ) \u2212 F1n (q 2 ) and\nthe iso-vector Pauli form factor F2v (q 2 ) = F2p (q 2 ) \u2212 F2n (q 2 ) can be given through the following relations [4, 8]:\nv 2\nh(r1v )2 i = h(rE\n) i\u2212\n\nh(r2v )2 i =\nwhich yield\n\n3 F2v (0)\n2 ,\n2 MN\n\n\u0001\n1\nv 2\n\u03bcv h(rM\n) i \u2212 h(r1v )2 i ,\n\u03bcv \u2212 1\n\n(69)\n(70)\n\np\np v\nh(r1 )2 i = 0.797(4) fm and h(r2v )2 i = 0.879(18) fm.\n\nAppendix B: Generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation and pion-pole dominance\n\nThe generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation is derived from the nucleon matrix elements of the currents on both\nsides of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity [24]; \u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 (x) = 2m\u0302P a (x) where the exact iso-spin symmetry is considered\n\n\f19\nas m\u0302 = mu = md . The nucleon matrix element of the divergence of the axial-vector current is represented in the\nfollowing form:\nhN (p\u2032 )|\u2202\u03b1 Aa\u03b1 (0)|N (p)i = \u016bN (p\u2032 )[i(p\n/ \u2212 /p\u2032 )FA (q 2 ) \u2212 q 2 FP (q 2 )]\u03b35 ta uN (p)\n= [2MN FA (q 2 ) \u2212 q 2 FP (q 2 )]\u016bN (p\u2032 )\u03b35 ta uN (p).\n\n(71)\n\nHere, it is worth mentioning that we have used the Dirac equation for the nucleon, \u016bN (p)(ip\n/ +MN ) = (ip\n/ +MN )uN (p) =\n0 to get from the first line to the second line. Then one easily finds that the q 2 -dependences of three form factors are\nconstrained by the following relation\n2MN FA (q 2 ) = q 2 FP (q 2 ) + 2m\u0302GP (q 2 ),\n\n(72)\n\nwhich is a consequence of the axial Ward-Takahashi identity. This expression may be referred to as the generalized\nGoldberger-Treiman relation [24].\nHere we discuss the case where the limits m\u0302 \u2192 0 and q 2 \u2192 0 are taken on Eq.(72). Of course, the left-hand side\n(l.h.s.) of Eq.(72) yields a non-zero value in the double limit. First, we consider the case where the chiral limit is first\ntaken before the limit of q 2 \u2192 0.\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\n2\nq\nlim\nF\n(q\n)\n,\n(73)\nlim\n2M\nF\n(q\n)\n=\nlim\nlim\nP\nN\nA\n2\n2\nq \u21920\n\nm\u0302\u21920\n\nm\u0302\u21920\n\nq \u21920\n\nwhich requires the massless pion pole in FP (q 2 ) in the chiral limit [35] as limm\u0302\u21920 FP (q 2 ) \u221d\nthe l.h.s. of Eq. (73). Secondly, the chiral limit is taken after the limit of q 2 \u2192 0:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\nlim lim\n2MN FA (q ) = lim 2m\u0302 lim\nGP (q ) ,\n2\n2\nm\u0302\u21920\n\nm\u0302\u21920\n\nq \u21920\n\nq \u21920\n\n1\nq2\n\nfor non-vanishing of\n\n(74)\n\n1\n\u223c m12 for non-vanishing of the l.h.s.\nwhich requires the 1/m\u0302 singularity in GP (q 2 ) at q 2 = 0 as limq2 \u21920 GP (q 2 ) \u221d m\u0302\n\u03c0\nof Eq. (74). As a result, FP (q 2 ) and GP (q 2 ) must have the pion-pole structure which should become dominant at\nlow q 2 [35]. Therefore, one can deduce that FP (q 2 ) and GP (q 2 ) are described by the following forms, at least, in the\nvicinity of the pole position q 2 = \u2212m2\u03c0 [35, 49].\n\nFPPPD (q 2 ) =\n\n2MN FA (q 2 )\n,\nq 2 + m2\u03c0\n\n2m\u0302GPPD\n(q 2 ) = 2MN FA (q 2 )\nP\n\nq2\n\n(75)\nm2\u03c0\n,\n+ m2\u03c0\n\n(76)\n\nwhich we call the pion-pole dominance (PPD) forms. Consequently, we realize that the ratio of GPPD\n(q 2 ) and\nP\nFPPPD (q 2 ) gives the low-energy constant B0 as\nGPPD\n(q 2 )\nP\n= B0 ,\nFPPPD (q 2 )\nwhere m2\u03c0 = 2m\u0302B0 .\n\n(77)\n\n\f20\n\n[1] For recent reviews, see K.

Remark that our \u03b35 definition, \u03b35 \u2261 \u03b3x \u03b3y \u03b3z \u03b3t = \u2212\u03b35M , has the opposite\nsign relative to that in the Minkowski convention (~\u03b3 M = i~\u03b3 and \u03b30M = \u03b3t ) adopted in the particle data group [22].\n[56] One might worry about the large scaling violation, which is observed for the axial-vector coupling gA in a quenched\ncalculation with overlap fermions at the same lattice spacing [38]. However, the previous quenched DWF studies reported\nthat there is no appreciate scaling violation in the kaon B-parameter BK [39] and proton decay matrix elements [40] at\n\n\f21\n\n[57]\n[58]\n[59]\n[60]\n[61]\n[62]\n\n\u03b2 = 0.87 (a \u2248 0.15 fm) and 1.04 (a \u2248 0.10 fm). We may deduce that no large scaling violation is ensured for other matrix\nelements as well in our DWF calculations.\nWe treat our data sets as 70 independent measurements after taking average of the multiple source results on each\nconfiguration.\nIt is worth mentioning that such consistency is not observed at L = 16, since the lowest q 2 point at L = 16 may suffer\nfrom the finite volume effect as we will describe in\u221aSec. V.\nHere we use a traditional convention as F\u03c0 = f\u03c0 / 2 \u223c 93MeV, while f\u03c0 is quoted in Ref.[20].\nStrictly speaking, the relativistic dispersion relation (18), which ensures that (ip\n/ + MN )uN (p) = 0, should be well satisfied\nin simulations.\nIn Ref. [7], the similar deviation from unity as \u03b1AWT > 1 can be read off from their Fig. 19 where an inverse of \u03b1AWT is\ngiven in the limit of q 2 \u2192 0.\nDetailed knowledge about the q 2 -dependence of the weak form factors in neutron beta decay is required for our lattice\nstudy of flavor SU (3) breaking effects in hyperon beta decays [50].\n\n\f22\nTABLE I: Experimental values of magnetic moments, electric charge and magnetization radii of the proton and neutron.\nObservable\n\u03bcp\n\u03bcn\np 2 1/2\nh(rE\n) i\nn 2\nh(rE\n) i\np 2 1/2\nh(rM\n) i\nn 2 1/2\nh(rM\n) i\n\nExperimental value\n+2.792847351(28)\n\u22121.91304273(45)\n0.8750(68) fm\n\u22120.1161(22) fm2\n0.855(35) fm\n0.873(11) fm\n\nReference\n[22]\n[22]\n[22]\n[22]\n[26]\n[27]\n\nTABLE II: Summary of available experimental data for the induce pseudo-scalar form factor FP (q 2 ).
