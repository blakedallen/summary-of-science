We measured the PV induced transition matrix\nelement to be 8.7 \u00b1 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 ea0 , which confirms the\ntheoretically anticipated PV enhancement in Yb [2] and\nconstitutes the largest atomic parity violation effect observed so far. However, the measurement accuracy is\nnot yet sufficient for the observation of the isotopic and\nhyperfine differences in the PV amplitude, the study of\nwhich is the main goal of the present experiments. Here\nwe describe the impact of the apparatus imperfections\nand systematic effects on the accuracy of the measurements and discuss ways of improving it.\nDuring the initial stage of the experiment, an effort\nwas invested into measuring various spectroscopic properties of the Yb system of direct relevance to the PV\nmeasurement, including determination of radiative lifetimes, measurement of the Stark-induced amplitudes, hyperfine structure, isotope shifts, and dc-Stark shifts of\nthe 6s2 1 S0 \u2192 5d6s 3 D1 transition [3]. In addition, the\n6s2 1 S0 \u2192 3 D2 transition at 404 nm has been observed,\nand the electric quadrupole transition amplitude and tensor transition polarizability have been measured [4]. The\nforbidden magnetic-dipole (M1) amplitude of the 408 nm\ntransition was measured to be 1.33 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03bcB using the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: tsigutkin@berkeley.edu\naddress: Department of Physics and Astronomy, Oberlin\nCollege, Oberlin, OH 44074\n\n\u2020 Present\n\nM1-(Stark-induced)E1 interference technique [5]. The\nytterbium atomic system, where transition amplitudes\nand interferences are well understood, has proven useful for gaining insight into the Jones-dichroism effects\nthat had been studied in condensed-matter systems at\nextreme conditions and whose origin had been a matter\nof debate (see Ref. [6] and references therein).\nAn experimental and theoretical study of the dynamic\n(ac) Stark effect on the 6s2 1 S0 \u2192 5d6s 3 D1 forbidden transition was also undertaken [7]. A model was developed to calculate spectral line shapes resulting from\nresonant excitation of atoms in an intense standing light\nwave in the presence of off-resonant ac-Stark shifts. A biproduct of this work was an independent determination\n(from the saturation behavior of the 408-nm transition)\nof the Stark transition polarizability, which was found to\nbe in agreement with the earlier measurement [4].\nThe present Yb APV experiment involves a measurement using an atomic beam. An alternative approach\nwould involve working with a heat-pipe-like vapor cell.\nVarious aspects of such an experiment were investigated,\nincluding measurements of collisional perturbations of\nrelevant Yb states [8], nonlinear optical processes in a\ndense Yb vapor with pulsed UV-laser excitation [9], and\nan altogether different scheme for measuring APV via\noptical rotation on a transition between excited states\n[10].\nThe present paper addresses the issues of sensitivity\nand systematics in the Yb APV experiment. In Sections II and III the experimental technique and its application in the present experiment are discussed. In\nSection IV a method of analyzing the impact of various\napparatus imperfections is described based on theoret-\n\n\f2\nical modeling of signals recorded by the detection system in the presence of imperfections. In Section V a detailed description of the experimental apparatus is given,\nalong with a discussion of the origins of the imperfections,\nwhich is followed by an account of the measurements of\nthe imperfections in Section VI. In Sections VII and VIII\nwe discuss measurements and analysis of the PV amplitude and systematic effects, and ways of improving the\naccuracy of the PV measurements to better than 1% in\norder to measure the difference in the APV effects between different isotopes and hyperfine components.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE FOR THE\nAPV MEASUREMENT\n\nStark interference. In addition, this effect is minimized\nby the use of a power-build-up cavity to generate a standing light wave. Since a standing wave has no net direction\nof propagation any transition rate which is linear in the\nM1 amplitude, will cancel out (see below).\nThe advantages of the present experimental configuration can be demonstrated by considering Yb atoms in the\npresence of static electric, E, and magnetic, B, fields interacting with a standing monochromatic wave produced\nby two counter-propagating coherent waves in an optical\ncavity. The electric field in the standing wave, E, is a sum\nof the fields of the two waves. For resonant atoms, the\ntransition rate from the ground state 1 S0 to the excited\nstate 3 D1 is (see e.g. [13], Eq. (3.127))\n4\n|AM |2 ,\n~2 \u0393\n\nRM =\nAs discussed in Ref. [1], the idea of the experiment is\nto excite the forbidden 408-nm transition (Fig. 1) with\nresonant laser light in the presence of a quasi-static electric field. The PV amplitude of this transition arises\ndue to PV mixing of the 5d6s 3 D1 and 6s6p 1 P1 states.\nThe purpose of the electric field is to provide a reference transition amplitude, which is due to Stark mixing\nof the same states interfering with the PV amplitude.\nIn such an interference method [11, 12], one is measuring the part of the transition probability that is linear in\nboth the reference Stark-induced amplitude and the PV\namplitude. In addition to enhancing the PV dependent\nsignal, the Stark-PV interference technique provides for\nall-important reversals that separate the PV effects from\nthe systematics.\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the natural linewidth of the transition, AM\nis the transition amplitude, and M = 0, \u00b11 is the magnetic quantum number of the excited state. Here and\nin the rest of this section it is assumed that the individual magnetic sublevels of the 3 D1 state are resolved. For\nconvenience, we set ~ = 1 henceforth and measure the\ntransition rate in units of \u0393.\nThe transition amplitude AM is the sum of the electric(E1) and magnetic- (M1) dipole transition amplitudes:\n(E1)\n\nAM = AM\n\n(M1)\n\n+ AM\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe E1 amplitude has two contributions corresponding\nto the Stark- and PV- mixing of the 3 D1 and 1 P1 states.\nThat is,\n(E1)\n\nAM\n\n(Stark)\n\n= AM\n\n(APV)\n\n+ AM\n\n= i\u03b2(\u22121)M (E \u00d7 E)\u2212M + i\u03b6(\u22121)M E\u2212M ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the vector transition polarizability, \u03b6 is related to the reduced matrix element of the Hamiltonian describing the weak interaction, and E0,\u00b11 are the\nspherical components of the vector E. Although Starkinduced transitions are generally characterized by scalar,\nvector, and tensor polarizabilities [4, 11], for the case of\na J = 0 \u2192 1 transition, only the vector polarizability\ncontributes. Equation (3) is derived in Appendix A.\nSimilarly, the M1 transition amplitude has two components: one for each of the two counter-propagating\nlaser beams. Let E + = E+ \u00ca and E \u2212 = E\u2212 \u00ca denote the\nelectric fields of the beams traveling in the k and \u2212k directions, respectively. Then E = E + + E \u2212 and the M1\namplitude is given by\nFIG. 1: (color online) Low-lying energy eigenstates of Yb and\ntransitions relevant to the APV experiment.\n\nEven though the APV effect in Yb is relatively large,\nand the M1 transition is strongly suppressed, the M1\ntransition amplitude is still three orders of magnitude\nlarger than the PV amplitude. As a result, the geometry\nof the experiment was designed to suppress spurious M1-\n\n(M1)\n\nAM\n\n= M(\u22121)M (k \u00d7 E + )\u2212M + M(\u22121)M (\u2212k \u00d7 E \u2212 )\u2212M\n\n= M(\u22121)M (\u03b4k \u00d7 E)\u2212M ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M is the reduced matrix element of the M1 transition and k is a unit vector in the direction of the\nwavevector. Here we have introduced \u03b4k = \u03b4k k with\n\u03b4k = (E+ \u2212 E\u2212 )/E. For a perfect standing wave, E+ = E\u2212\n\n\f3\nand hence \u03b4k = 0 and the M1 transition is completely\nsuppressed. In practice, E\u2212 = E+ \u2212 \u03b4E due to the small\nbut nonzero transmission of the back mirror in the cavity.\nSince |\u03b4E| \u226a E, |\u03b4k| \u2248 |\u03b4E/E| \u226a 1. Thus, although the\nM1 transition amplitude is not strictly zero, it is highly\nsuppressed.\nWithout loss of generality, the quantities \u03b2, \u03b6, and M\nare assumed to be real. In general, the rate RM given\nby Eq. (1) includes terms proportional to \u03b2M (Stark-M1\ninterference) and \u03b2\u03b6 (Stark-PV interference).\nA careful choice of field geometry allows for additional\nsuppression of undesirable Stark-M1 interference. From\nEq. (3), it is evident that the Stark-PV interference is\nproportional to the rotational invariant\n\nWith this field orientation (see Fig. 2), Eqs.

The first-harmonic signal due to Stark-PV interference has a characteristic signature: the sign of the\noscillating terms for the two extreme components of the\ntransition is opposite to that of the central component.\nThe second-harmonic signal provides a reference for the\nlineshape since it is free from interference effects linear\nin E (Fig. 3b). With a non-zero DC component present\nin the applied electric field, a signature identical to that\nin the second harmonic will also appear in the first harmonic, Fig. 3c. The latter can be used to increase the\nfirst-harmonic signal above the noise, which makes the\nprofile analysis more reliable.\nTo obtain the PV term from the measured firstand second-harmonic transition rates, we first normalize\n[1]\nthe first-harmonic signals RM by their second-harmonic\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: Discrimination of the PV effect by E-field modulation\nunder static magnetic field.

This\nmethod has the advantage that K is independent of Edc ,\nso that the E-field bias may be chosen based on technical\nrequirements of the experimental apparatus.\n\nof the out-of-phase AC components was analyzed within\na complete model of the systematics and found to be\nnegligible. The AC components are due to misalignments\nof the applied E-field with respect to the light wave axis\nas well as to the quantization axis \u1e91. The DC components\narise due to a misalignment of the DC-bias field and also\ndue to stray electric fields in the interaction region.\nThe magnetic-field imperfections are defined within\nthe same frame of reference by taking analogously\nB = B\u0303 + B\u2032 ,\nwhere\nB\u0303 = b\u0303x x\u0302 + b\u0303y \u0177 + B\u1e91\nB\u2032 = b\u2032x x\u0302 + b\u2032y \u0177 + b\u2032z \u1e91,\nwhere B\u0303 and B\u2032 are reversing and stray non-reversing\nmagnetic fields, respectively.\nEquations (1) through (4) apply when the quantization axis is along the magnetic field, thus a rotation D is\napplied to each of the vectors E, B, E, and k such that\nDB \u221d \u1e91.

PV SIGNATURE: IMPACT OF\nAPPARATUS IMPERFECTIONS\n\nD = D(\u2212\u03b1y , \u0177)D(\u03b1x , x\u0302).\n\nWhile the current Yb-APV apparatus has been designed to minimize systematic effects, the PV mimicking\nsystematics may be a result of a combination of multiple\napparatus imperfections. In order to understand the importance of these effects, the electric and magnetic field\nmisalignments and stray fields were included in a theoretical model of the transition rates as well as the excitation\nlight's deviations from linear polarization. In addition,\nwe relax the assumption that \u03b4k = 0 and include the\neffects of the residual M1 transition.\nThe quantization axis is defined along \u1e91, and following\nthe ideal case model, the axis of the standing light wave\nis collinear with x\u0302. We added a small ellipticity to the\nlight polarization by taking\ni\u03c6\n\nE = E(\u0177 sin \u03b8 + \u1e91 e cos \u03b8),\n\n(16)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a small phase. For |\u03c6| \u226a 1, the ellipticity\nof the light is 2\u03c6 sin(2\u03b8). The electric field imperfections\nare included by taking\nE = \u1ebc + E\u2032 ,\nwhere\n\u1ebc = (\u1ebc0 x\u0302 + \u1ebdy \u0177 + \u1ebdz \u1e91) cos(\u03c9t)\nE\u2032 = Edc x\u0302 + ey \u0177 + ez \u1e91,\nare the AC and DC components of the electric field. It is\nassumed that the y- and z-components of the AC field are\nin phase with the leading oscillating E-field.

Expressions for the lowest-order terms are summarized in the Table I.\nThe normalized-amplitude combination (14) has been\nchosen to determine the PV asymmetry.

In order to\ndetermine which terms could potentially mimic the PV\nasymmetry in K, we discriminate the PV contribution\nto K with respect to the B-field reversal and flip of the\npolarization angle, \u03b8. Switching to a different Zeeman\ncomponent of the transition is also a reversal, which is incorporated in the expression for the asymmetry, K. Analysis of the noise affecting the accuracy of PV-asymmetry\nmeasurements demonstrate that the highest signal-tonoise ratio is achieved when \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/4, and therefore,\nthe polarization flip is a change of the polarization angle by \u03c0/2. Thus, the normalized-amplitude combination (14) must be determined for four different combinations of the B-field directions and light-polarization angles: K(+B, +\u03c0/4), K(\u2212B, +\u03c0/4), K(+B, \u2212\u03c0/4), and\nK(\u2212B, \u2212\u03c0/4), so that terms having different symmetries\nwith respect to the reversals can be isolated:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nK1\n\u22121 \u22121 +1 +1\nK(+B, +\u03b8)\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef K2 \uf8fa 1 \uf8ef \u22121 +1 +1 \u22121 \uf8fa \uf8ef K(\u2212B, +\u03b8) \uf8fa\n\uf8fa= \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa*\uf8ef\n\uf8fa.\n\uf8f0 K3 \uf8fb 4 \uf8f0 +1 \u22121 +1 \u22121 \uf8fb \uf8f0 K(+B, \u2212\u03b8) \uf8fb\nK4\n+1 +1 +1 +1\nK(\u2212B, \u2212\u03b8)\n(20)\nThe result of this procedure is summarized in Table II.\n\nPV asymmetry, 16\u03b6/\u03b2 \u1ebc, is \u223c 4 * 10\u22124 , for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 and\n\u1ebc0 = 2 kV/cm. For a typical value of misalignments\nand \"parasitic\" fields, ey,z /\u1ebc0 and b\u0303x /B (on the order of\n10\u22123 in the present apparatus), the contribution of the\n\"parasitic\" terms may be up to a few percent of the total\nvalue of K1 . Ways of measuring the contribution of these\nimperfections are discussed in the following sections.\n\nV.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\n\nThe forbidden 408-nm transition is excited by resonant\nlaser light coupled into the power-buildup cavity in the\npresence of the magnetic and electric fields. The transition rates are detected by measuring the population of\nthe 3 P0 state, where 65% of the atoms excited to the\n3\nD1 state decay spontaneously (Fig. 1). This is done\nby resonantly exciting the atoms with 649-nm light to\nthe 6s7s 3 S1 state downstream from the main interaction region, and by collecting the fluorescence resulting\nfrom the decay of this state to the 3 P1 and 3 P2 states\nand subsequently, from the decay of the 3 P1 state to the\nground state 1 S0 (556 nm transition). As long as the 408nm transition is not saturated, the fluorescence intensity\nmeasured in the probe region is proportional to the rate\nof that transition.\nA schematic of the Yb-APV apparatus is shown in Fig.\n2. A beam of Yb atoms is produced (inside of a vacuum\nchamber with a residual pressure of \u2248 3\u00d710\u22126 Torr) with\nan effusive source: a stainless-steel oven loaded with Yb\nmetal, operating at 500 \u2212 600\u25e6 C. The oven is outfitted\nwith a multi-slit nozzle, and there is an external vane\ncollimator reducing the spread of the atomic beam in the\nhorizontal direction. The resulting Doppler width of the\n408-nm transition is \u2248 12 MHz [7].\n\nTABLE II: List of the lowest-order terms contributing to the\nasymmetry K for |\u03b8| = \u03c0/4 sorted with respect to their response to the reversals.

Up to 80 mW of light at the transition wavelength of 408.345 nm in vacuum is produced\nby frequency doubling the output of a Ti:Sapphire laser\n(Coherent 899) using the Wavetraincw ring-resonator\ndoubler. After shaping and linearly polarizing the laser\nbeam, \u2248 10 mW of the 408-nm radiation is coupled into a\npower buildup cavity (PBC) inside the vacuum chamber.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) Schematic of the optical setup. Light at 408-nm is produced by frequency doubling the output of a\nTi:Sapphire laser (Coherent 899) using the Wavetraincw ring resonator doubler. The laser is locked to the PBC using the\nFM-sideband technique. The PBC is locked to a confocal Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon. This scannable \u00e9talon provides the master\nfrequency. The 649-nm excitation light is derived from a single-frequency diode laser (New Focus Vortex). The diode laser is\nlocked to a frequency-stabilized He-Ne laser using another scanning Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon.\n\nThe cavity was designed to operate as an asymmetric cavity with flat input mirror and curved back mirror\nwith a 25-cm radius of curvature and 22-cm separation\nbetween the mirrors. The atomic beam intersects the\ncavity mode in the middle of the cavity, where the 1/e2\nradius of the mode in intensity is 172 \u03bcm. The asymmetric configuration has the advantage of larger mode radius\nat the interaction position compared to a symmetric cavity. A larger mode allows us to reduce the ac-Stark shifts,\nconsequently reducing the width of the 408 nm transition.\nAlternatively, the cavity can be modified to operate in the\nsymmetric confocal condition where multiple transverse\nmodes can be excited, thereby increasing the effective\n\"mode\" size. However, we were unable to obtain high\npower and stable lock for the confocal configuration.\nThe cavity mirrors were purchased from Research Electro Optics, Inc. For the flat input mirror the transmission\nis 350 ppm with the absorption and scattering losses of\n150 ppm total at 408 nm. The curved back mirror is designed to have a lower transmission of 50 ppm in order\nto additionally suppress the net light wave vector and,\ntherefore, the M1 transition amplitude. The absorption\nand scattering losses in the curved mirror are 120 ppm.\nThe finesse and the circulating power of the PBC are\nup to F = 9000 and P = 8 W. These parameters were\n\nroutinely monitored during the PV measurements. Details of the characterization of the PBC are addressed in\nAppendix B.\nWe found that the use of the 408-nm-PBC in vacuum\nis accompanied by substantial degradation of the mirrors.\nTypically after 6 hours of operation, the finesse drops by\na factor of two. This is a limiting factor for the duration\nof the measurement run. The degradation of the finesse\nis due to the increased absorption and scattering losses.\nThis effect is reversible: the mirror parameters can be\nrestored by operating the PBC for several minutes in\nair, which makes performing a number of runs possible\nwithout replacing the mirrors. However, it takes several\nhours with the present apparatus to reach the desired\nvacuum after exposing the PBC to air. Presently, this\neffect is under investigation aiming for longer-duration\nexperiments and shorter breaks in between.\nA schematic of the PBC setup is presented in Fig. 4.\nThe mirrors are mounted on precision optical mounts\n(Lees mounts) with micrometer adjustments for the horizontal and vertical angles and the pivot point of the\nmirror face. The mirror mounts are attached to an Invar\nrod supported by adjustable table resting on lead blocks.\nThe input mirror is mounted on a piezo-ceramic transducer allowing cavity scanning.\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) Schematic of the E-field electrodes assembly, and a result of the E-field modeling showing an X-Z\nslice of the amplitude of the E-field z-component, ez , in a\nmidplane (Y=0) of the assembly normalized by the total Efield amplitude, E. The voltage is applied to electrode 1, and\nelectrode 2 and the correction electrodes are grounded.\n\nThe laser is locked to the PBC using the FM-sideband\ntechnique [16]. In order to remove frequency excursions\nof the PBC in the acoustic frequency range, the cavity\nis locked to a more stable confocal Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon,\nonce again using the FM-sideband technique. This stable\nscannable cavity provides the master frequency, with the\npower-build-up cavity serving as the secondary master for\nthe laser. A schematic of the optical system is presented\nin Fig. 5.\nThe magnetic field is generated by a pair of rectangular coils designed to produce a magnetic field up to 100 G\nwith a 1% non-uniformity over the volume with the dimensions of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cm3 in the interaction region. Additional coils placed outside of the vacuum chamber compensate for the external magnetic fields down to 10 mG\nat the interaction region. The residual B-field of this\nmagnitude does not have an impact on the PV measurements since its contribution is discriminated using the\nfield reversals.\nThe electric field is generated with two wire-frame electrodes separated by 2.1 cm (see Fig. 6). The copper electrode frames support arrays of 0.2-mm diameter gold-\n\nplated wires. This design allows us to reduce the stray\ncharges accumulated on the electrodes by minimizing the\nsurface area facing the atomic beam, thereby minimizing\nstray electric fields. AC voltage of up to 10 kV at a\nfrequency of 76.2 Hz is supplied to the electrodes via a\nhigh-voltage amplifier. An additional DC bias voltage of\nup to 100 V can be added.\nThe result of the electric field non-uniformity calculations is shown in Fig. 6. These calculations demonstrate\nthat errors in the centering of the light beam with respect\nto the E-field plates may induce substantial parasitic\ncomponents as large as, for example, |ez | \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u1ebc0 ,\nproducing parasitic effects comparable to the PV asymmetry. In order to measure and/or compensate the\nimpact of the parasitic fields, additional electrodes designed to simulate stray E-field components were added\nto the interaction region. By applying high-voltage to\nthese electrodes (\"correction electrodes\" in Fig. 6), the\nparasitic-field components may be exaggerated and accurately measured as described in the following sections.\nLight at 556 nm emitted from the interaction region\nis collected with a light guide and detected with a photomultiplier tube. This signal is used for initial selection of the atomic resonance and for monitoring purposes. Fluorescent light from the probe region is collected onto a light guide using two optically polished\ncurved aluminum reflectors and registered with a cooled\nphotodetector (PD). The PD consists of a large-area\n(1 \u00d7 1 cm2 ) Hamamatsu photodiode connected to a 1-G\u03a9\ntransimpedance pre-amplifier, both contained in a cooled\nhousing (temperatures down to \u221215\u25e6C). The pre-amp's\nbandwidth is 1 kHz and the output noise is \u223c 1 mV\n(rms). The 649-nm excitation light is derived from a\nsingle-frequency diode laser (New Focus Vortex) producing \u2248 1.2 mW of cw output, high enough to saturate\nthe 6s6p 3 P0 \u2192 6s7s 3 S1 transition. Due to the saturation of this transition, \u223c3 fluorescence photons per\natom exited to the 3 P0 state are emitted at the probe\nregion. The natural width of the 649-nm transition is\n70 MHz, thus, its profile covers all transverse velocity\ngroups (vx ) in the atomic beam (\u2248 8 MHz Doppler width\nat 649 nm). A drift of the laser frequency (\u223c 100 MHz\nper minute) is eliminated by locking the diode laser to a\nfrequency-stabilized He-Ne laser using a scanning FabryP\u00e9rot \u00e9talon with the scanning rate of 25 Hz. The spectral distance between the \u00e9talon transmission peaks from\nthe two lasers is measured during each scan and maintained constant within an accuracy of \u00b13 MHz, good\nenough to eliminate any degradation of the probe-region\nsignal.\nThe signals from the PMT and PD are fed into lockin amplifiers for frequency discrimination and averaging.\nA typical time of a single spectral-profile acquisition is\n20 s. The signals at the first and the second harmonic of\nthe electric-field modulation frequency are registered simultaneously, which reduces the influence of slow drifts,\nsuch as instabilities of the atomic-beam flux. The modulation frequency is limited by several factors. Thermal\n\n\f8\ndistribution of atomic velocities in the beam causes a\nspread (of \u2248 2 ms) in the time of flight between the interaction region and the probe region. This, along with\nthe finite bandwidth of the PD, leads to a reduction of\nthe signal-modulation contrast (see below). The choice\nof the modulation frequency of 76.2 Hz is a tradeoff between this contrast degradation and the frequent E-field\nreversal.\n\nVI.\n\nRESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nIn Fig. 7 a profile of the B-field-split 408-nm spectral\nline of the 174 Yb is shown. The 649-nm-light-induced fluorescence was recorded during a single profile scan. Statistical error bars determined directly from the spread of\ndata are smaller than the points in the figure. The peculiar asymmetric line shape of the Zeeman components is\na result of the dynamic Stark effect [7].

In the first one, a DCvoltage was applied to the correction electrodes, and the\nex\nmeasurements were done reversing eex\ny and ez . These\nexperiments yield values of \u1ebdy and \u1ebdz + 2\u1ebc0 b\u0303x /B. In the\nsecond set, an AC-voltage modulated synchronously with\nthe main E-field is applied to the correction electrodes.\nIn order to reverse the sign of the parasitic terms a \u03c0ex\nphase-shift of \u1ebdex\ny and \u1ebdz with respect to the modulation\nsignal is employed by switching the wiring of the correction electrodes. Thus, values of the DC-imperfections, ey\nand ez , are determined. The magnitudes of the applied\nelectric fields and their distributions are calculated using\na 3D-numerical-model of the interaction region. The results of the experiments are presented in Table III.

Then,\nthe combination K of Eq. (14) is computed for each profile scan followed by averaging the result over all the scans\nat a given B-\u03b8 configuration. This procedure is repeated\nfor all four reversals, and all B-\u03b8 symmetrical contributions, K1\u22124 , are determined. In the present experiment,\nthe values of K2,3,4 -terms are found to be consistent with\n\nDC-Set\nAC-Set\nExaggerated imperfections (V/cm)\neex\n\u1ebdex\ny = \u2212140(2)\ny = \u2212120(2)\nex\nez = 20(2)\n\u1ebdex\nz = 30(2)\nMeasurements (mV/cm)\n\u1ebdex\neex\nz\n= 16(10)\ney z = 4(5)\n\u1ebdy\n2\u1ebc0\n2\u1ebc0\neex\n\u1ebdex\nb\u0303x\ny\ny\n(2\u1ebc0\n+ \u1ebdz )\n= 442(10)\nez\n= 40(5)\nB\n2\u1ebc0\n2\u1ebc0\nParasitic fields (V/cm)\n\u1ebdy = 3.2(2)\nb\u0303x\n(2\u1ebc0\n+ \u1ebdz ) = \u221212.6(0.3)\nB\n\ney = 0.5(0.6)\nez = \u22121.3(0.2)\n\nnet contribution of these imperfections to K1 in the absence of the exaggerated fields is found to be 2 :\n!\n\u1ebdy\nb\u0303x\n\u1ebdz\n+ ez\n+\n=\ney\nB\n2\u1ebc0\n2\u1ebc0\n= \u22122.6(1.6)stat.(1.5)syst. mV/cm.\n\n1\n\nIn the normalized rate calculations only data points having intensity higher that 1/3 of the respective Zeeman peak are used\nto avoid excessive noise from spectral regions with low signal\nintensity.\n\n2\n\n(21)\n\nCompare with the PV asymmetry parameter \u03b6/\u03b2 \u2248 40 mV/cm.\n\n\f9\nThe systematic uncertainty comes from a sensitivity of\nthe numerical model of the E-field, which is used for calculating the exaggerated fields in the interaction region,\nto an imperfect approximation of the electrode-system\ngeometry. These experiments suggest that this field's\nimperfection cannot mimic the PV-effect entirely, nevertheless, it appears to be a major source of systematic uncertainty impacting the accuracy of the PV-asymmetry\nmeasurements. The most prominent contribution is given\nby a combined effect of the parasitic components of the\nelectric field and the non-zero projection of the leading magnetic field on the direction of the electric field:\ney (\u1ebdz /2\u1ebc0 + b\u0303x /B). The PV-asymmetry parameter, \u03b6/\u03b2\nis obtained from the measured value of K1 by compensating for the influence of these magnetic- and electric-field\nimperfections, Eq. (21).\nThere is another effect that cannot, by itself, mimic\nthe PV-asymmetry, but needs to be taken into account\nfor proper calibration. This effect is related to the E-field\nmodulation implemented in the present experiment. The\natoms are excited to the metastable state, 6s6p 3 P0 , by\nthe light beam in the interaction region and then travel\n\u223c20 cm until they are detected downstream in the probe\nregion. Due to the spread in the time-of-flight between\nthe interaction and probe regions, the phase mixing leads\nto a reduction of the signal modulation contrast at the\nprobe region, and it depends on the signal-modulation\nfrequency. Since the signal comprises two time-scales of\ninterest, first- and second-harmonic of the E-field modulation, the contrast reduction is different for the two.\nTherefore, the ratio of the signal modulation amplitudes,\nrM , on which we base the PV-asymmetry observation,\nappear altered in the probe region compared to what it\nwould be at the interaction region. The amplitude combination, K, and, therefore, the PV-parameter, \u03b6/\u03b2, are\nsimilarly affected. In our data analysis, a correction coefficient, C0 , is introduced, which has been calculated\ntheoretically:\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n= C0\n.\n\u03b2 probe reg.\n\u03b2 real\nUnder present experimental conditions, this coefficient,\nC0 , is found to be 1.028(3), and the measured PV parameter is corrected accordingly. Principles of its derivation\nare given in Appendix C.\nIn Fig. 8, the PV interference parameter \u03b6/\u03b2 is shown\nas determined in 19 separate runs (\u223c60 hours of integration in total). Its mean value is 39(4)stat. (3)syst. mV/cm,\nwhich is in agreement with the theoretical predictions\n[14, 15]. The value of the PV parameter was extracted\nusing the expression given in the first column of Table II, taking into account the calibration correction\nC0 . Thus, |\u03b6| = 8.7 \u00b1 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221210 ea0 , which is the\nlargest APV amplitude observed so far (here we used\n\u22128\n|\u03b2| = 2.24+0.07\nea0 /(V/cm) [4, 7]).\n\u22120.12 \u00d7 10\nThe sign of the PV interference parameter \u03b6/\u03b2 is found\nby comparing the measurements with the theoretical\n\nFIG. 8: (color online) The PV interference parameter \u03b6/\u03b2.\nMean value: 39(4)stat.

The direction and, thus, the signs of\nthe electric and magnetic fields as well as the polarization\nangle \u03b8 were calibrated prior to the PV measurements.\nSpecial care was taken of detecting parasitic phase shifts\nin the lock-in amplifier. A signal from an arbitrary function direct digital synthesis (DDS) generator simulating\nthe output of the probe region photodetector was fed\ninto the amplifier. The signal is comprised of a sum of\ntwo sinusoidal waveforms, one frequency doubled, attenuated, and phase shifted with respect to the other. Results\nof the signal parameters measurement from the lock-in,\nsuch as the first-to-second harmonic amplitude ratio, relative phase shift and its sign, are compared to those used\nin the DDS generator to simulate the signal. The difference in the measured and generated amplitude ratio is\nfound to be below 0.01%, and the relative phase shift is\ndetected within \u00b11.5\u25e6 . No relative sign flips between the\nfirst- and second-harmonic amplitudes were detected.\n\nVII.\n\nERROR BUDGET\n\nThe present measurement accuracy is not yet sufficient\nto observe the isotopic and hyperfine differences in the\nPV amplitude, which requires an accuracy better than\n\u2248 1% for PV amplitude in a single transition [17\u201319]. In\nthe present apparatus the signal levels achieved values\nhigh\np enough to reach the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\n2/ \u03c4 (s) for the PV asymmetry if the noise were dominated by the fluorescence-photon shot-noise (\u03c4 is the integration time). This is good enough to reach the subpercent accuracy in a few hours of integration. However,\na number of additional factors limit the accuracy.\nOne of the most important noise sources is the fluctuations of the modulating- and DC-field parameters during\nthe experiment. The first- and the second-harmonic signals depend differently on the modulating electric field\namplitude, \u1ebc0 , and the DC-bias, thus, a noise in the\nelectronics controlling the fields contaminates the first-\n\n\f10\nto-second harmonic ratio directly. A substantial effort\nwas made to cope with this problem: a home-built highvoltage amplifier used in the first 13 runs was replaced\nby a commercial Trek 609B amplifier and a circuit controlling the DC-bias was upgraded. This allowed us to\ncontrol the DC-bias and \u1ebc0 with mV-scale accuracy that\nwould make the SNR to approach the shot-noise limit if\nthis were the only source of the noise. As seen in Fig. 8,\nthe last six measurements exhibit higher accuracy than\nthe rest. These are the runs after the HV-system\np upgrade. However, the present SNR of \u2248 0.03/ \u03c4 (s) is\nworse by almost two orders of magnitude than the shotnoise limit.\nThere are other fluctuations in the system parameters,\nsuch as light intensity fluctuations in the PBC, fluctuations of the spectral position of the PBC resonance with\nrespect to the frequency reference, and noise in the detection system. All of them contribute to the noise in\nthe first- and the second- harmonic signals but we found\nthat such noise largely canceled in the ratio rM .\nHowever, there is a noise source, which is not canceled\nin the ratio. The following experiments demonstrated\nthat this noise source is related to frequency excursions\nof the Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon serving as the frequency reference for the optical system. In these experiments the\nexcitation light was frequency tuned to a wing of the\natomic resonance, and the first- and second-harmonic signals were recorded without scanning over the resonance.\nThen, the same was done when the spectral position was\nset at the peak of the resonance, and a change of the SNR\nfor the harmonics ratio was determined. These experiments were performed using the upgraded HV-system.\nResults of the measurements are presented in Fig. 9. For\n\nFIG. 9: (color online) Impact of the frequency excursions of\nthe Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon on the noise level in the harmonics\nratio. A change in the noise level when the optical system\nwas tuned from the wing of the atomic resonance to its peak\nis shown. In the inserts above the excitation light spectral\nposition is shown schematically with respect to the atomic\nresonance. Arrows denote the fluctuations.\n\na shot-noise-limied signal, the SNR at the peak of the\n\n\u221a\nresonance is expected to be a factor of about 2 higher\nthan at the wing due to larger signal. It was found,\nhowever, that the SNR went up by a factor of 4 by tuning from the wing to the peak of the resonance. This\ndemonstrates that the main source of noise is not photon\nstatistics but fluctuations in the spectral reference. Indeed, the frequency excursions at the wing of the spectral\nline produces substantially more intensity noise due to a\nsteeper spectral slope than that at the peak, where the\nslope is nominally zero. It must be emphasized, that in\nthe case of slow frequency excursions (compared to the\nE-field modulation period), the noise in the first- and the\nsecond-harmonic channels would be canceled in the ratio.\nHowever, fast excursions can generate noise in the signal\nratio.\nThe factors affecting the measurement accuracy mentioned above have an impact on the statistical error of\nthe result. The present systematic errors (summarized in\nTable IV) has nearly the same significance as the statistical one and also comprises a number of factors.\nOne of the most significant factors is the uncertainty\nin the field-imperfection contributions, Eq. (21). This\nuncertainty is mostly due to statistical factors such as\nlaser drifts, nevertheless, it provides an offset to the PVparameter. Since the measurement of this contribution\nis actually the same measurement as the PV-effect, any\nimprovements of the stability reduces the overall systematic uncertainty. We would like to emphasize also that\nEq. (21) represents a mean value of the imperfection contribution over numerous experiments averaging over possible fluctuations of the field-imperfection contribution.\nThese fluctuations may be partially responsible for the\nvariance in the PV-parameter, and, thus, the statistical uncertainty of its value. This fact demonstrates that\nthe elimination of the field-imperfections is an essential\nrequirement for improving the overall accuracy of the experiments.\nAnother significant source of the systematic uncertainty is the uncertainty in the value of the electric field\nin the interaction region. While the voltage applied to\nthe E-field plates and the correction electrodes is controlled precisely, the actual E-field value used in the PV\nparameter determination depends on the accuracy of the\nnumerical modeling of the electric-field distribution in the\nparticular geometry. There are two factors in the model\ncontributing to the uncertainty: finite accuracy of measurements of the interaction region geometrical parameters, and the imperfect approximation of the geometry in\nthe numerical simulation.\nHowever, while this systematic uncertainty plays a significant role for measurements of the PV parameter of a\nsingle isotope, for the isotope ratios this uncertainty will\ncancel (or will be substantially reduced), if the measurements observing different isotopes are performed without\nchanging the E-field geometry. The same is true for the\ncalibration parameter, C0 , which also cancels in the isotope ratios.\nThere are other, rather minor, factors contributing to\n\n\f11\nthe systematic uncertainty, for example, a finite accuracy\nof the polarization angle flip, errors in the lock-in amplifiers, a finite dynamic range of the lock-ins etc. The net\ncontribution of these factors is found to be . 1%.\nA summary of the systematic error budget is presented\nin Table IV.\n\nE.

The net uncertainty of the PV parameter of a\nsingle isotope must be better than 1% based on the theoretical predictions. To this end, a program of the apparatus upgrades and improvements is developed. Besides\ngeneral improvements of the stability of the system parameters, increase of the signal levels, suppression of the\nelectronics noise etc., the main focus is on elimination\nof the frequency excursions of the frequency reference,\nwhich is a major source of the statistical noise. Improving\nthe statistical uncertainty will contribute to more precise\nmeasurement and control of the E-field-imperfection contribution to the systematic part of the uncertainty. The\nlatter is another high-priority improvement essential for\nreaching the goal.\nIn the future apparatus, the referencing of the optical system to the Fabry-P\u00e9rot \u00e9talon will be replaced\nby locking the system to a femtosecond frequency comb\nthat will be available shortly. The impact of the E-field\nimperfection is planned to be substantially suppressed\nby redesigning of the interaction region to provide more\nuniform and controlled electric field distribution. Until\nnow, no scientific or technical obstacles were discovered\npreventing us to improve the apparatus to the desired\nlevel of sensitivity.\n\nwhere \u03bc = \u2212g\u03bcB J is the magnetic dipole moment of the\natom, g is the Land\u00e9 factor, \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton,\nand J is the angular-momentum operator.

The laser beam is sent through a\nPockels cell (Cleveland Crystals Inc. QX 1020 Q-Switch)\nand a polarizer before entering the cavity. The polarizer\nis aligned with the laser polarization so that the light is\ntransmitted when there is no voltage applied to the Pockels cell. A high-voltage pulse generator is used to send\na fast step signal (30-ns wavefront) to the Pockels cell\nwhich rotates the polarization of the light so that it is not\ntransmitted through the polarizer. The laser frequency is\nlocked to the resonance frequency of the cavity, and then\nthe Pockels cell is switched into the non-transmitting\nstate, causing a fast interruption of the laser power. The\nsubsequent decay of the light inside the cavity is monitored with a fast photodiode (50-MHz bandwidth) measuring the power transmitted through the back mirror of\nthe cavity. The signal is fit to an exponential decay.

This places a limit on the modulation frequency:\nWe require that \u03c9 < v0 /d = 2\u03c0\u00d7 230 Hz in order to\navoid a significant decrease in signal.\nThe lock-in amplifier receives an input signal propor[2]\n[1]\ntional to RM and returns two output signals SM and SM\ncorresponding to the first and second harmonic components, respectively. This process can be modeled as\n[n]\n\nAtoms undergo the 6s2 1 S0 \u2192 5d6s 3 D1 transition\nin the interaction region where they are illuminated by\n408-nm light and are exposed to the static magnetic field\nand the oscillating electric field E(t). Excited atoms\nthen spontaneously decay from the 5d6s 3 D1 state to the\nmetastable 6s6p 3 P0 state. The population of 6s6p 3 P0\nis proportional to the transition rate RM for M = 0, \u00b11.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the constant\nof proportionality is equal to one.\nThe rate RM is measured in the probe region. The\nprobe region is located a distance d \u2248 20 cm away from\nthe interaction region. Therefore, an atom that arrives\nat the detection region at time t experienced an electric\nfield with magnitude E(t\u2212d/vz ) in the interaction region,\n\n(C2)\n\nSM (\u03c6n ; \u03b1) =\n=\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nRM (\u03c4 ; \u03b1) cos(n\u03c4 + \u03c6n ) d\u03c4\n0\n[n]\nRM |I(n\u03b1)| cos(Arg[I(n\u03b1)] + \u03c6n ),\n\n(C5)\n\nwhere the phases \u03c61,2 of the lock-in amplifier are chosen\n[1,2]\nto maximize the signals SM . That is,\n\u03c6n = \u03c6n (\u03b1) \u2261 \u2212Arg[I(n\u03b1)].\n\n(C6)\n\nOur measurement sM is the ratio of the first- and secondharmonic signals:\n[1]\n\n[1]\n\nsM =\n\nSM (\u03c61 ; \u03b1)\n[2]\n\nSM (\u03c62 ; \u03b1)\n\n=\n\nRM |I(\u03b1)|\n[2]\n\nRM |I(2\u03b1)|\n\n= rM \u00d7 C(\u03b1), (C7)\n\n\f14\nwhere C(\u03b1) \u2261 |I(\u03b1)|/|I(2\u03b1)| is the correction factor.\nTherefore, we must further divide the ratio sM of observed output signals by C(\u03b1) to measure the ratio rM .\nThe correction factor C(\u03b1) and the optimal lock-in\nphases \u03c61,2 (\u03b1) inherit dependence on the modulation frequency (\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 76.2 Hz), the distance between interaction and detection regions (d \u2248 20 cm), and the oven\ntemperature (T \u2248 873 K) through the parameter \u03b1:\n\u03c9d\n\n\u03b1= p\n= 0.33(2),\n2kB T /m\n\nwhere the uncertainty in \u03b1 is given by\np\n\u03b4\u03b1 = \u03b1 (\u03b4T /2T )2 + (\u03b4d/d)2 ,\n\n(C8)\n\n(C9)\n\n(C10)\n\nwith uncertainty given by \u03b4C0 = |C \u2032 (\u03b1)| \u03b4\u03b1.

The uncertainty in the correction factor becomes\n\n\u03b4C0 \u2192 \u03b4 C\u03030 =\n\nfor \u03b4T \u2248 50 K and \u03b4d \u2248 1 cm.

This choice\nis consistent with the magnitude of the uncertainty in\nthe optimal phases \u03c610 and \u03c620 . Therefore, we will take\n\u03b4\u03c6n = \u03b4\u03c6n0 to be the accuracy with which we can select\nthe lock-in phases. Then \u03b4\u03c61 = 0.02, \u03b4\u03c62 = 0.03, and\n\u03b4 C\u03030 = 0.0031 \u2248 0.0029 = \u03b4C0 .\n\n(C15)\n\nHence small deviations (on the order of 1\u25e6 ) have a negligible effect on the uncertainty in the correction factor.\n\n[11] M.
