INTRODUCTION\n\nVirialized cold dark matter halos grow hierarchically, by\nthe merging of smaller virialized halos. Galaxies, which\npopulate the halos, also grow hierarchically by the merging of pre-existing galaxies. Halo merger rates can be estimated analytically using the excursion-set theory (Bond et al.\n1991), which is commonly known as the Extended PressSchechter formalism (Press & Schechter 1974; Bower 1991;\nLacey & Cole 1993). The merger rates can also be extracted\nfrom large-scale cosmological simulations. Direct measurement of merger rates in galaxy groups and clusters, however,\nis challenging. While mergers can be identified by unrelaxed\nX-ray morphologies (e.g., Jeltema et al. 2005) or by the presence of radio halos produced by nonthermal particles associated with merger shocks (e.g., Ensslin & R\u00f6ttgering 2002),\nthese methods are not yet precise enough to yield accurate\nestimates of merger rates. We here show that a simple statistic, the luminosity gap, can be applied to large galaxy surveys\nsuch as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to test the predictions of the excursion-set merger probabilities.\nDark matter halos merge from the outside in. Mergers effectively begin when the components approach within a virial\nradius of each other; they conclude when the separate identities of the two halos have been erased, either by the merging\nof the halo centers or by the complete tidal disruption of the\nsmaller halo. The duration of the merger defined this way depends on the rate at which dynamical friction induces orbital\ndecay of the tidally truncated subhalos. If a galaxy is located\nat the center of each subhalo, the galaxies appear as separate\nobjects until the conclusion of the merger. The timescale of\norbital decay can exceed the age of the system; this is why\nthe number of galaxies in a groups or cluster (the \"occupation\nnumber\") exceeds unity.\n1 Theoretical Astrophysics, Mail Code 130-33, California Institute of\nTechnology, 1200 East California Boulevard, Pasadena, CA 91125.\n2 Hubble Fellow.\n3 Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory, NOAO, Casilla 603, La Serena, Chile.\n4 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Irvine,\nIrvine, CA 92617.\n\nA confirmation of this paradigm can be found in the existence of \"fossil\" groups of galaxies, which contain a single ultraluminous galaxy at the center and no other galaxy\nbrighter than L\u22c6 . The X-ray luminosity of fossil groups is\ncomparable to that of rich clusters and indicates dynamical\nmasses \u223c (1013 \u20131014 ) M\u2299 . Jones et al. (2003) selected fossil groups with the criterion \u2206mag12 > 2, where the luminosity gap \u2206mag12 is defined as the difference in photometric magnitude between the most and second most luminous\ngalaxies in the group; we adopt this definition as well. Fossil groups have been identified as cluster-sized systems old\nenough that any previous merger with a halo hosting a & L\u22c6\ngalaxy has completed so that all luminous galaxies have agglomerated onto the central galaxy. Their incidence rate is\n(8\u201320)% among observed systems in this mass range, at least\nif the mass is inferred from the X-ray luminosity (Jones et al.\n2003). Numerical simulations by D'Onghia et al. (2005) predict a larger fraction of fossil systems: (33 \u00b1 16)% for mass\n1014 M\u2299 . These investigations suggest that fossil groups, poor\nclusters, and rich clusters can be distinguished by the time\nelapsed since the last major merger. We show here that the\nincidence rate of fossil groups can be estimated analytically\nfrom excursion set theory.\nIn \u00a7 2, we compute the time scale on which dynamical friction drives orbital inspiral of a tidally truncated subhalo inside\nthe primary halo. In \u00a7 3, we estimate the subhalo mass distribution as a function of the subhalo mass and distance from the\ncenter of the primary halo. In \u00a7 4, we calculate the luminosity distribution of the most luminous satellite galaxy within\nthe cluster and the dependence of the luminosity gap on the\nhalo mass. We also derive the fraction of fossil systems in\ngroups and clusters as a function of mass. In \u00a7 5, we compare\nthe predictions of our model to the luminosity gap distribution in 730 clusters from the SDSS C4 Catalog (Miller et al.\n2005). Finally, in \u00a7 6, we show that the observed intrinsic\nscatter in the Lc \u2013M relation on cluster scales can be ascribed\nto dispersion in the merger histories. Throughout the paper\nwe assume the standard cosmological model consistent with\nthe results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(Spergel et al. 2003).\n\n\f2\n\nMILOSAVLJEVI\u0106 ET AL.\n2. DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION\n\nConsider a subhalo of mass Ms merging into a primary halo\nof mass Mh \u2265 Ms at redshift zm . We define a \"merger\" as the\ntime when the center of subhalo crosses the virial radius of the\nnew composite halo of mass M = Mh + Ms . After the halos coalesce, the subhalo spirals toward the center of the composite\nhalo. The effective dynamical mass of the subhalo decreases\nafter the merger because bound mass is tidally stripped as the\norbit of the subhalo decays. We denote the bound mass by\nMs (Rs ), where Rs is the tidal truncation radius. This is related\nto the separation r of the subhalo from the center of the composite halo via Ms (Rs )/R3s = M(r)/r3 , where M(r) is the mass\nof the composite halo contained within radius r. This relation\nyields Rs and Ms (Rs ) in terms of r.\nThe subhalo experiences a torque T = |r \u00d7 F|, where r\nis its position relative to the center of the composite halo\nand F is force of dynamical friction (Chandrasekhar 1943)\n|F| = 4\u03c0G2 Ms (Rs )2 \u03c1(r) ln(\u039b)/v2 . Here, \u03c1(r) is the density of\nthe composite halo at distance radius r, ln(\u039b) is the Coulomb\nlogarithm (which in principle depends on the orbit of the\nsubhalo and on the orbital phase space distribution of dark\nmatter), and v is the velocity of the subhalo. To simplify\nthe calculations we assume circular orbits. Then the velocity of the subhalo is the circular velocity in the composite\nhalo v = [GM(r)/r]1/2 . In numerical simulations of satellites\nin halos ln(\u039b) \u223c 2 (Velazquez & White 1999; Fellhauer et al.\n2000).\nThe galaxies spiral toward the center of the composite halo\nat the rate\n\u0012 \u0013\u22121\ndJ\nT\ndr\n=\n,\n(1)\ndt Ms (Rs ) dr\nwhere J = [GM(r)r]1/2 is the specific angular momentum\nassociated with the orbit of the subhalo. We assume\nthat the density profile of the halo follows the form of\nNavarro, Frenk, & White (1997), with the concentration parameter from the Bullock et al. (2001) fit. Equation (1) can be\nintegrated to find the distance of the subhalo from the center\nof the composite halo as a function of time.\n3. SUBHALO DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe would like the probability that a subhalo of mass Ms is\nlocated at distance r from the center of the composite halo of\nmass M. The extended Press-Schechter formalism does not\ndirectly yield such an expression because halos grow through\nan entire hierarchy of mergers. We present a variation of\none of the established models for the subhalo mass function\n(e.g., Nusser & Sheth 1999; Fujita et al. 2002; Sheth 2003;\nLee 2004; Oguri & Lee 2004). These models ignore a number of issues, such as halo triaxiality and the evolution of substructure within substructure. Our confidence in their validity\nstems from their success in reproducing subhalo statistics in\nlarge-scale numerical simulations (e.g., Zentner et al. 2005),\ngravitational lensing observations (e.g., Natarajan & Springel\n2004), and the cluster luminosity function (Cooray & Cen\n2005). Note that the known problems with the extended PressSchechter merger rates are not severe for the mass ratios of\ninterest (Benson et al. 2005).\nLacey & Cole (1993) give an expression for the fraction of\nmass of a halo with mass M at redshift z that lies in progenitors\nwith masses between Ms and Ms + dMs at redshift zm :\nf (Ms , zm |M, z) =\n\n\u03b4c (zm ) \u2212 \u03b4c(z)\n(2\u03c0)1/2 [\u03c3 2 (Ms ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (M)]3/2\n\nd\u03c3 2 (Ms )\ndMs\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n[\u03b4c (zm ) \u2212 \u03b4c(z)]2\n\u00d7 exp \u2212\n,\n2[\u03c3 2 (Ms ) \u2212 \u03c3 2 (M)]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3(M) is the mass variance on scale M and \u03b4c (z) is the\ncritical overdensity for collapse at redshift z. The progenitor\nmass function is obtained by multiplying f (Ms , zm |M, z) by\nthe halo multiplicity factor, dN/dMs = (M/Ms ) f .\nLacey & Cole (1993) define the formation redshift as the\ntime at which the most massive progenitor halo contains half\nof the mass of the final halo. Equation (2) is integrated with\nrespect to Ms and differentiated with respect to zm to obtain\nthe growth rate of the fraction of the halo mass in large objects; we interpret this as the probability that a halo at redshift\nz formed at a redshift between zm and zm + dzm ,\nZ M\ndP\nd\n(zm , M, z) =\nf (Ms , zm |M, z)dMs\n(3)\ndzm\ndzm Mmin\nwhere Mmin \u2265 21 M is a minimum mass cutoff.\nFollowing Oguri & Lee (2004), we multiply the subhalo\nmass function by the formation redshift distribution\nd2N\ndN\ndP\n\u223c\n\u00d7\n(4)\ndMs dzm\ndMs dzm\nand interpret the result as the probability that the halo acquired\na subhalo of mass Ms at redshift zm . This interpretation is\nonly heuristic; doing better requires integrating over merger\ntrees. Such a treatment would improve upon the imprecise\ndefinition of \"formation time\" (Cohn & White 2005) and its\nlikely correlation with subhalo properties, but we defer that to\nfuture work.\nThe probability that a subhalo of mass Ms lies a distance\nr from the halo center, as a function of the halo mass M and\nredshift of observation z, is given by (we suppress the dependence on M and z everywhere)\ndzm\nd2N\nd2N\n(Ms , zm )\n(Ms , r) =\n(Ms , zm )\n(5)\ndMs dr\ndMs dzm\ndr\nfor r < Rvir (M, z), where the average density of the halo is 200\ntimes the mean density of the universe within the virial radius,\nand dzm /dr is the inverse of the derivative of the separation at\nredshift z with respect to the merger redshift zm (from eq. [1],\nafter converting cosmic time to redshift).\nThe luminosity gap is independent of the subhalo position,\nso we integrate equation (5) with respect to radius to obtain\nZ zm (Ms ,0)\ndNR\nd2N\n(Ms ) =\n(Ms , zm )dzm ,\n(6)\ndMs\nzm (Ms ,R) dMs dzm\nwhere R \u2264 Rvir is a constant radius and zm (Ms , r) is implicitly\ndefined by the relation\nZ zm (Ms ,r)\ndr \u2032\ndzm .\n(7)\nRvir [zm (Ms , r)] \u2212 r =\n\u2032\ndz\nz\nm\nWe solve (7) approximately by evaluating the virial radius at z\nrather than zm and by evaluating dr/dzm at Rvir (z). The latter\napproximation is justified because dr/dzm depends on radius\nonly weakly, especially when r \u223c Rvir .\nThe number of subhalos with mass greater than Ms is\nZ M\ndNR \u2032\n(M )dM \u2032 .\n(8)\nNR (Ms ) =\n\u2032\nMs dM\nEquation (8) defines a one-to-one relation between Ms of a\nparticular subhalo and the expected number of subhalos above\n\n\fTHE LUMINOSITY GAP STATISTIC\n\nF IG . 1.- Probability distribution for the luminosity gap \u2206mag12 at z = 0\ncalculated using equation (14). From left to right, the curves correspond to\nhalos with mass M = (1012.5 , 1013.5 , 1014.5 , 1015.5 ) M\u2299 . We assumed ln \u039b =\n2, Mmin = 12 M, and R = Rvir (M) throughout. While the initial mass of the\nsatellite is always smaller than the mass of the primary, the luminosity of\nthe satellite galaxy may exceed that of the primary because of the scatter in\nthe Lc \u2013M relation (equation 12), leading to a negative luminosity gap; the\nmeasured quantity is |\u2206mag12 |.\n\nthis threshold. It is straightforward to show that the distribution of the most massive surviving subhalo mass, M2 , is\ndN\nd \u2212NR (M2 )\n=\u2212\ne\n.\n(9)\ndM2\ndM2\nSimilarly, the distribution of the second most massive surviving subhalo mass, M3 , is\nd\ndN\n=\u2212\n{[1 + NR(M3 )]e\u2212NR (M3 ) }.\ndM3\ndM3\n\n(10)\n\n4. THE LUMINOSITY GAP DISTRIBUTION\n\nWe next calculate the distribution of luminosities of the\nfirst and second most luminous satellites in a galaxy cluster. Thus we need to relate the initial mass of a subhalo to\nthe luminosity Lc of its central galaxy. At z \u2248 0, Lc in any\nhalo is tightly correlated with its mass (Vale & Ostriker 2004;\nCooray & Milosavljevi\u0107 2005a,b), with a functional form\nLc (M) = L0\n\n(M/M0 )a\n,\n[b + (M/M0)cd ]1/d\n\n(11)\n\nOur fit to the r-band luminosities in Seljak et al. (2005) yields\nL0 = 5.7 \u00d7 109L\u2299 , M0 = 2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 , a = 4, b = 0.57, c = 3.78,\nand d = 0.23. The relation possesses lognormal intrinsic scatter (Cooray & Milosavljevi\u0107 2005b)\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nlog[L/Lc (M)]2\ndN\n, (12)\n(L|M) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\ndL\n2\u03a32\n2\u03c0 ln(10)\u03a3L\nwhere in the r-band \u03a3 \u2248 0.17+0.02\n\u22120.01 in clusters (Cooray 2005).\nWe assume that the most luminous galaxy is located at the\ncenter of the composite halo. Then the remaining subhalos\ncannot contain the most luminous galaxy in the cluster; the\nmost luminous galaxy in a subhalo is the second most luminous member of the cluster. The distribution of galaxy luminosities associated with the kth most massive subhalo is then\nZ M\ndN\ndN\ndN\n=\ndMk .\n(13)\n(Lk |Mk )\ndLk\ndL\ndMk\n0\nThe luminosity gap \u2206mag1k is the (observed) magnitude\ndifference between the first and the kth most luminous galaxies in a cluster.

The curves assume ln \u039b = 1 and Mmin = 21 M (solid line), ln \u039b = 2\nand Mmin = 21 M (dashed line), and ln \u039b = 1 and Mmin = 34 M (dot-dashed line).\nThe shaded rectangle is the measurement of Jones et al.

In systems of mass M the gap is distributed as\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\ndN\ndN\ndN\n(\u2206mag1k |M) =\n(Lk , M)\n(L|M)\nd\u2206mag1k\ndLk\ndL\n0\n0\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\nLk\n5\ndLk dL,\n(14)\n\u00d7\u03b4 \u2206mag1k + log\n2\nL\nwhere \u03b4(x) is the Dirac delta-function. In Figure 1 we plot\ndN/d\u2206mag12 for halos of various masses; the median luminosity gap is larger in smaller halos.\nThe incidence rate Pf (M) of \"fossil\" systems (\u2206mag12 > 2)\ncan then be calculated by integrating equation (14). In Figure\n2 we plot Pf (M) for several combinations of input parameters.\nOn scales M \u223c 1014 M\u2299 , the probability that the system is fossil is \u223c (3\u20136)%, fairly close to the observed value (Jones et al.\n2003). It is, however, smaller than the same probability estimated from the simulations of D'Onghia et al. (2005, see \u00a7 1).\nThe three curves illustrate the errors we expect from our simplified treatment; they do not affect our qualitative results but\nmay be distinguishable with more extensive observations.\n5. THE LUMINOSITY GAP IN SDSS-C4 CLUSTERS\n\nWe measured the luminosity gap distribution on 730 clusters in the SDSS C4 Cluster Catalog (Miller et al. 2005)\nat mean redshift hzi = 0.087. The three brightest cluster members were identified from the SDSS photometry\nas being within a projected 500h\u22121 kpc radius of the center of the cluster. Additionally, these galaxies must have\nmr \u2212 mi colors that lie within 2\u03c3 of the E/S0 cluster ridgeline as determined by spectroscopically confirmed members\n(Visvanathan & Sandage 1977). We utilize extinction corrected model-fit magnitudes and apply z = 0 K-corrections\n(version 3.2, Blanton et al. 2003).\nThe masses of these clusters are estimated from the total\nr-band luminosities via log(h\u22121 M) \u2248 \u22122.46 + 1.45 log(h\u22122 Lr );\n95% lie in the range (0.5\u201310) \u00d7 1014(h/0.7)\u22121 M\u2299 . The total\nluminosity is a better mass estimator than the line-of-sight velocity dispersion or the richness of the cluster (Miller et al.\n2005; see also Lin, Mohr, & Stanford 2004, Popesso et al.\n2005, and references therein). A histogram of the luminosity\ngap distribution is shown in Figure 3. The mean luminosity\ngap is h\u2206mag12 i \u2248 0.75.\nTo predict the luminosity gap distribution of the C4 sample, we multiply dN/d\u2206mag12 of equation (14) at z = 0 by the\n\n\f4\n\nMILOSAVLJEVI\u0106 ET AL.\nIn Figure 3b we present the luminosity gap distribution relative to the third most luminous galaxy in the cluster (see eq.\n[10]). The model overpredicts the frequency of small \u2206mag13\nbecause it treats the luminosities of the second and third most\nluminous galaxy as independent, whereas the former must exceed the latter by definition.\n6. THE ORIGIN OF THE LC \u2013M SCATTER\n\nThe final accretion of a satellite halo at the center of the\nprimary halo is accompanied by an instantaneous increase\nof the central galaxy's luminosity. Therefore, the accretion\nhistory is a source of intrinsic scatter in the Lc \u2013M relation.\nWe estimate the dispersion \u03a3 of the central galaxy luminosity arising through the merger variance alone as the average\nluminosity of the most massive satellite galaxy, hL2 (M)i, assuming no intrinsic scatter in the mass-luminosity relation,\n\u03a3(M) \u223c hL2 (M)i/ ln(10)Lc(M).1 In our model,\nhL2 (M)i =\nF IG . 3.- r-band luminosity gap distribution from 730 clusters in the SDSS\nC4 Catalog (Miller et al. 2005). We evaluate the luminosity gap relative to,\n(a) the first and second most luminous galaxies, and (b) the first and the third\nmost luminous galaxies. We also show predictions of our model with ln \u039b = 1\nand Mmin = 21 M (thick line) and with ln \u039b = 1 and Mmin = 12 M (dot-dashed\nline). Fossil systems are located to the right of the dashed line; Pf \u2248 2.9% in\nthe data and 2.7% in the model.\n\nmass function of C4 clusters and integrate over mass. The resulting composite model luminosity gap distribution is shown\nby the thick solid and dot-dashed lines in Figure 3a. The\nagreement of the model and data is remarkable for the choice\nof the dynamical friction parameter ln \u039b = 1. For ln \u039b & 2, the\nmodel distribution develops a local minimum at \u2206mag12 = 0\nand its maximum shifts to \u2206mag12 \u223c 0.6 (dot-dashed line in\nFig. 3). Such behavior is not apparent in C4 clusters, but it has\nbeen detected in luminous red galaxies (LRG) in SDSS imaging data by Loh & Strauss (2005), who measured the luminosity gap within 1.0h\u22121 Mpc of LRGs and found that the peak\nmoved to positive values in underdense fields. These curves\nillustrate the sensitivity of the luminosity gap to the detailed\nproperties of mergers; clearly the qualitative fit is excellent,\nbut more detailed model-fitting may in the future enable tests\nof particular aspects of merger dynamics.\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nM\n\nLc (M2 )\n\ndN\n(M, M2 )dM2 .\ndM2\n\n(15)\n\nWe average the dispersion calculated this way over the mass\nfunction of clusters in our C4 sample; it is \u03a3\u0304 = 0.23 \u00b1 0.01, depending on the choice of ln \u039b. This is not far from our adopted\nvalue \u03a3r = 0.17 and from \u03a3 \u2248 0.168 measured by Yang et al.\n(2003). Therefore, the dispersion in the Lc \u2013M relation in clusters can be explained by the dispersion in accretion histories.\nIf this interpretation is correct, \u2206mag1k at fixed cluster mass\nwould be correlated with the central galaxy luminosity, implying that the factors of dN/dL(L|M) in equations (13) and\n(14) must be replaced by a single multivariate distribution in\n(L, Lk ); we defer this possibility to a more detailed treatment.\n\nWe are grateful to D.
