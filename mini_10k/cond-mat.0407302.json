These ILMs are generic to physical systems of interest, such as arrays of nonlinear\noptical waveguides[2], molecular crystals[3], biopolymers[4], arrays of Josephson junctions[5]\nand even Bose-Einstein condensates in magneto-optical traps[6].\nGiven the strictly local manner in which nonlinearity enters into the effective evolution\nequations in all these cases (see below), one is led to the idea that in the limit of strong\nnonlinearity, one could approximate a typical nonlinear system by a linear one containing a\nsmall cluster of nonlinear sites, or even a single nonlinear impurity. The system thus simplified is amenable to exact mathematical treatment, and the influence of other, potentially\ncompeting effects such as dimensionality, boundary effects, noise, etc., can be more easily\nstudied without losing the essential physics.\nFor a one-dimensional discrete system in the presence of a single nonlinear impurity,\nlocated at n = d, the dynamics is given by the well-known discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\n(DNLS) equation:\ni\n\ndCn\n= V (Cn+1 + Cn\u22121 ) \u2212 \u03c7|Cn |\u03b2 Cn \u03b4n,d ,\ndt\n\n(h\u0304 \u2261 1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Cn is the probability amplitude for finding the excitation on site n, V is the nearestneighbor transfer matrix element, \u03c7 is the nonlinearity parameter and \u03b2 is the nonlinearity\nexponent. Usually, but not always, \u03b2 = 2 which in a condensed mater context corresponds\nto an underlying harmonic oscillator degree of freedom 'enslaved' to the excitation (electron)\nat the impurity site. When this vibrational impurity is anharmonic in nature, other \u03b2 values\nare possible in principle, with \u03b2 < 2 corresponding to a \"hard\" vibrational impurity while\n\u03b2 > 2 corresponds to a \"soft\" case[7].\nBound states for single nonlinear impurities embedded in infinite lattices include\nchains[10, 11, 12], Cayley trees[14], triangular[16] and a cubic[15, 16] lattices. Now, since\nthe creation of a bound state, or the dynamical selftraping at the impurity site implies the\nlocalization of energy on a scale of the order of the lattice spacing, one might surmise that,\nby placing the nonlinear impurity at or near the surface of a semi-infinite lattice, the nonlinearity strength needed to effect localization would decrease, facilitating in this way its\ncreation and experimental observation. As an step in that direction, in this work we exam2\n\n\fV\n\nV\n0\n\n...\n\nV\n\nV\n\n...\n\nd\n\n2\n\n1\n\nV\n\n....\n\nFIG. 1: A nonlinear impurity near the surface of a one dimensional chain\n\nine a simple model consisting of an electron (or excitation) propagating in a semi-infinite,\nlinear chain, that contains a single nonlinear impurity at a distance d from the beginning\n('surface') of a semi-infinite chain (Fig. 1), and examine the conditions for the existence of\nbound state(s) and the dynamical selftrapping properties, and compare them to the results\nobtained for the infinite chain [11].\nBound States. We consider Eq.(1) for a semi-infinite lattice (n = 0, 1, * * * ) and normalize\nall energies to the half bandwidth of the infinite chain case. The Hamiltonian is given by\n\u221e\n\n1X\nH=\n(|nihn + 1| + |n + 1ihn|) + \u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 |dihd|\n2 n=0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere {|ni} are Wannier states and \u03b3 \u2261 \u03c7/(2V ). The dimensionless Green function G =\n\n1/(z \u2212 H) can be formally expanded as[18] G = G(0) + G(0) H1 G(0) + G(0) H1 G(0) H1 G(0) + * * * ,\n\nwhere G(0) is the unperturbed (\u03b3 = 0) Green function and H1 = \u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 |dihd|. The series\ncan be resumed to all orders to yield\n(0)\n\nGmn =\n\nG(0)\nmn\n\n+\n\n(0)\n\n\u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 Gmd Gdn\n\n(0)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 Gdd\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Gmn \u2261 hm|G|ni. Now, we cannot use Eq.(3) directly since we do not know Cd , but\nwe will determine it through an exact selfconsistent procedure: The energy of the bound\n(0)\n\nstate(s) is obtained form the poles of Gmn , i.e., by solving 1 = \u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 Gdd (zb ). On the other\nhand, the bound state amplitudes Cn are obtained form the residues of Gmn at z = zb . In\n(0) 2\n\n\u2032 (0)\n\nparticular, at the impurity site, |Cd |2 = Res{Gdd (z)}z=zb = \u2212Gdd (zb )/Gdd (zb ) Inserting\nthis back into the bound state energy equation leads to\n(0) \u03b2+1\n\n1\nGdd\n(zb )\n=\n.\n\u2032 (0)\n\u03b3\n[\u2212Gdd (zb )]\u03b2/2\n\n(4)\n\n(0)\n\nThe unperturbed Green function Gmn for the semi-infinite lattice, can be calculated by the\n(0)\n\nmethod of mirror images: Since there is no lattice to the left of n = 0, Gmn should vanish\n(0)\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nidentically at n = \u22121. Thus, Gmn (z) = G\u221e\nmn (z) \u2212 Gm,\u2212n\u22122 (z), where Gmn (z) is the Green\n\n3\n\n\f\u221a\n\u221a\n|n\u2212m|\n2\n2\nfunction for the infinite lattice, G\u221e\n, where\nmn (z) = sgn(z)(1/ z \u2212 1)[z \u2212 sgn(z) z \u2212 1]\nsgn(z) = +1(\u22121) for z > 0(< 0). Therefore,\n\u221a\n1\n[z \u2212 sgn(z) z 2 \u2212 1]|n\u2212m|\nz2 \u2212 1\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212sgn(z) \u221a\n[z \u2212 sgn(z) z 2 \u2212 1]|n+2+m| .\nz2 \u2212 1\n\nG(0)\nmn (z) = sgn(z) \u221a\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(5)\n\u2032 (0)\n\nFrom Eq.(5) we note the parity property Gdd (\u2212z) = \u2212Gdd (\u2212z), which implies Gdd (\u2212z) =\n\u2032 (0)\n\nGdd (\u2212z). This means, according to Eq.(4) that the change \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3, reverses the sign\nof zb . On the other hand, from Eq.(1), it is possible to deduce that the change \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3\n\nis equivalent to the change Cn \u2192 (\u22121)n Cn\u2217 . Since we are interested in a localized state,\nwhere the Cn can be chosen as real, we conclude that a change in sign of the nonlinearity\nparameter reverses both the \"staggered\" character of the bound state and the sign of the\nlocalized state energy.\nAfter inserting Eq.(5) into (4), the general structure for the number of bound states\nemerges: For any finite distance d from the surface and any positive value of the exponent\n\u03b2, there is a critical amount of nonlinearity \u03b3 below which there is no bound state, and above\nwhich there are two bound states. For \u03b2 exponents smaller than 2, and as d is increased, one\nof the bound states tends to merge with the band edge, so that in the limit of a very deep\nimpurity, there is only a single localized bound state. For \u03b2 > 2, however, as d is increased,\nboth bound states remain localized. In the special case of a linear impurity (\u03b2 = 0), there\nis a single bound state provided \u03b3 > 1/(d + 1). Thus, in the limit d \u2192 \u221e these results\nare consistent with the case of a completely infinite lattice[11]: A single bound state for\n\u03b2 < 2, and for \u03b2 > 2, a critical curve in nonlinearity strength-nonlinearity exponent space,\nseparating a region with no bound states from a region with two bound states. At the\nsurface (d = 0) the critical curve is given by\n\u03b3c =\n\n(1 + \u03b2)(1+\u03b2)/2\n2\u03b2 \u03b2/2\n\n(6)\n\nIn particular, for the DNLS case, \u03b3c = 33/2 /4 \u2248 1.3, larger than the value for the infinite\nchain (\u03b3c = 1). Figure 2 shows phase diagrams in \u03b3-\u03b2 space showing the number of bound\nstates, at different distances d between the impurity and the 'surface' of the system.\nAs to the stability of these bound states, it is easy to see from a graphical analysis of\nthe structure of Eq.(4) that, as nonlinearity \u03b3 is increased one of the bound states becomes\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: Phase diagram in \u03b3-\u03b2 space, showing the number of bound states, for different distances\nimpurity-surface (in units of the lattice constant).\n\n\u03b2=4\n\n1.5\n\n\u03b2=3\n\u03b2=2\n\nCritical nonlinearity\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\u03b2=0\n\n\u03b2=1\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\nDistance from surface\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: Scaled critical nonlinearity for onset of a bound state, as a function of the distance from\nthe nonlinear impurity to the 'surface' of the chain.\n\nmore and more localized, while the other becomes more and more delocalized. Since, in the\nlimit of high nonlinearity, the effective coupling among sites is negligible, one would expect\nthe bound state to become more and more localized. Therefore, the state with smaller\nlocalization length is stable, the other unstable. This qualitative argument is confirmed by\nthe more rigorous procedure of examining the Hamiltonian flow of the system around the\ntwo fixed points (bound states).\nFigure 3 shows the critical nonlinearity for the onset of a bound state, as a function of\nthe distance from the impurity to the lattice 'surface' (n = 0), for different nonlinearity ex-\n\n5\n\n\fponents. Significative differences from the infinite lattice case are apparent: As the impurity\nis placed closer and closer to the surface, the critical nonlinearity to create a bound state\nincreases or decreases, depending upon whether the nonlinear exponent is below or above,\napproximately two. In particular, for the all-important standard DNLS case, \u03b2 = 2, the\npresence of a surface increases the nonlinearity needed to create a bound state, contrary to\npopular belief that a surface would help localize the electron.\nFor a given value of exponent \u03b2 and any inclusion distance d, the bound state probability\np\nprofile |Cn |2 is given in closed form by |Cn |2 = A[ Q|n\u2212d| \u2212Q|n+d+2| ], where Q \u2261 zb \u2212 zb2 \u2212 1,\np\nA \u2261 (zb \u2212 Q)/(zb + (zb + 2(1 + d) zb2 \u2212 1)Q2(1+d) ) and zb is the solution of Eq.(4). Simple\n\nanalysis of this profile shows that |Cn |2 has always a single hump at n = d. This profile\nis shown in Fig.4 for the standard DNLS (\u03b2 = 2) and a nonlinearity strength \u03b3 just above\ncritical, at four different impurity locations under the surface. its general features are shared\nby other \u03b2 exponents. Below the surface, the probability profile converges quickly to the\n0.8\n\n|Cn|2\n\n0.6\n\nd=1\n\nd=0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.8\n\nd=3\n\nd=2\n|C n|2\n\n|C n|2\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n60\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 4: Probability profile for the stable bound state at different impurity positions (\u03b2 = 2,\n\u03b3 = 1.305).\n\ninfinite lattice case as d increases past 4.\nDynamical Seltrapping. We compute numerically the long-time average probability at\nRT\nthe impurity site, Pd = limT \u2192\u221e (1/T ) 0 dt|Cd |2 , for several distances d from the 'surface'\n(n = 0). As initial condition, we use a completely localized excitation on the impurity\nsite: Cn (0) = \u03b4nd . Figure 5 shows the critical nonlinearity for selftrapping (Pd > 0) as a\nfunction of the distance between the nonlinear impurity and the chain surface, for different\nnonlinearity exponent values. In general, the behavior is qualitatively similar to the one\nobserved for the onset of a bound state (Fig.3). In both cases, for a fixed distance, an\n6\n\n\fincrease of the nonlinear exponent \u03b2 results on an increase of the nonlinearity threshold for\nselftrapping. The same behavior was observed previously for an impurity in a completely\ninfinite chain[11]. This phenomenon is not hard to explain: Since |Cn | < 1, we see from\n\nEq.(1) that as \u03b2 > 0 is increased, |Cd |\u03b2 will necessarily decrease, which implies that a larger\n\u03b3 will be needed to keep the value of the effective impurity strength \u03b3|Cd |\u03b2 . Thus, at a fixed\n\nimpurity-surface distance, a higher \u03b2 implies a higher \u03b3c . Another interesting behavior we\nobserve from figs.5 and 3 is that for a fixed nonlinearity exponent, the critical nonlinearity\ndepends roughly on whether the exponent is below or above two, approximately: For \u03b2 < 2,\nan increase in the impurity-surface distance d results on a decrease of \u03b3c , while for \u03b2 > 2, an\nincrease in d increases \u03b3c . The explanation of this phenomenon seems to rest on the delicate\nbalance between kinetic and potential energies. If we assume an electronic bound state \u03a8\nwith localization length \u03bb, then on normalization grounds we have |\u03a8|2 \u223c 1/\u03bb. The kinetic\n\nenergy content is \u2206K \u223c h2 /2m\u03bb2 , while the average potential energy is in magnitude equal\nR\nR\nto \u2206V = dx V (x)|\u03a8(x)|2 = dx \u03b3|\u03a8(x)|\u03b2 |\u03a8(x)|2 \u223c \u03b3a/\u03bb[1+(\u03b2/2)] , where a is of the order\nof the lattice spacing. Thus,\n\u2206V /\u2206K \u223c \u03b3 \u03bb1\u2212(\u03b2/2) .\n\n(7)\n\nOn the other hand, as the impurity is brought closer to the surface, the wavefunction becomes\nmore 'compressed' (Fig.4), i.e., \u03bb decreases as d approaches zero. This implies, from Eq.(7)\nthat for \u03b2 > 2, a decrease in \u03bb increases \u2206V with respect to \u2206K, which means that less\nnonlinearity is needed to maintain a localized state. On the contrary, if \u03b2 < 2, an decrease\nin \u03bb decreases \u2206V with respect to \u2206K and now, more nonlinearity is needed to maintain\nthe localized state.\nCompletely nonlinear lattice. In the large nonlinearity limit where \u03b3 \u226b \u03b3cr , the single\nnonlinear impurity results should approximate those corresponding to a whole nonlinear\nlattice. For the particular case examined in this work, the \"extended\" problem consists of\nthe formation of an intrinsic localized mode (ILM) in a semi-infinite nonlinear latice. Due\nto the presence of a surface, the discrete translational invariance is broken and a natural\nquestion arises: where will the localized state be formed? Our single nonlinear impurity\nanalog can provide an answer. For each impurity position d, the bound state energy can\nbe computed as a function of d. The position corresponding to its minimum value will\ncorrespond to the position of the ILM. Also, the impurity energy and spatial probability\nprofile should approximate the ones corresponding to the ILM.
