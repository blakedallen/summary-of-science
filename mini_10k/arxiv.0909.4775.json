However,\nSUSY has also theoretical problems, and, in particular, a very important one is the socalled \u03bc -problem. This problem arises from the requirement of a SUSY mass term for\nthe Higgs fields in the superpotential of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM), \u03bc \u0124u \u0124d , which must be of the order of the electroweak scale to successfully\nlead to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the presence of a GUT and/or a gravitational\ntheory with typical scales 1016 and 1019 GeV, respectively, one should explain how to\nobtain a SUSY mass term of the order of 102 \u2212 103 GeV.\nOn the other hand, neutrino experiments have confirmed during the last years that\nneutrinos are massive. As a consequence, all theoretical models must be modified in\norder to reproduce this result.\nThe \"\u03bc from \u03bd \" Supersymmetric Standard Model (\u03bc\u03bd SSM) was proposed in the\nliterature [1, 2]1 as an alternative to the MSSM. In particular, it provides a solution to\nthe \u03bc -problem and explains the origin of neutrino masses by simply using right-handed\nneutrino superfields.\nThe superpotential of the \u03bc\u03bd SSM contains, in addition to the usual Yukawas for\nquarks and charged leptons, Yukawas for neutrinos \u0124u L\u0302 \u03bd\u0302 c , terms of the type \u03bd\u0302 c \u0124d \u0124u\nproducing an effective \u03bc term through right-handed sneutrino vacuum expectation values (VEVs), and also terms of the type \u03bd\u0302 c \u03bd\u0302 c \u03bd\u0302 c avoiding the existence of a Goldstone\nboson and contributing to generate effective Majorana masses for neutrinos at the elec1\n\nSeveral recent papers have studied different aspects of the \u03bc\u03bd SSM. See the works in [3, 4, 5, 6].\n\n\ftroweak scale. Actually, the explicit breaking of R-parity in this model by the above\nterms produces the mixing of neutralinos with left- and right-handed neutrinos, and as a\nconsequence a generalized matrix of the seesaw type that gives rise at tree level to three\nlight eigenvalues corresponding to neutrino masses [1]. It is worth noticing here that this\npossibility of using a seesaw at the electroweak scale avoids the introduction of ad-hoc\nhigh energy scales in the model.\nThe breaking of R-parity can easily be understood if we realize that in the limit where\nneutrino Yukawa couplings are vanishing, the \u03bd\u0302 c are just ordinary singlet superfields,\nwithout any connection with neutrinos, and this model would coincide (although with\nthree instead of one singlet) with the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(NMSSM) where R-parity is conserved. Once we switch on the neutrino Yukawas, the\nfields \u03bd\u0302 c become right-handed neutrinos, and, as a consequence, R-parity is broken.\nIndeed this breaking is small because, as mentioned above, we have an electroweak\nscale seesaw, implying neutrino Yukawas no larger than 10\u22126 (like the electron Yukawa)\n\u22122\nto reproduce the neutrino masses ( <\n\u223c 10 eV).\nSince R-parity is broken, one could worry about fast proton decay through the usual\nbaryon and lepton number violating operators of the MSSM. Nevertheless, the choice of\nR-parity is ad hoc. There are other discrete symmetries, like e.g. baryon triality which\nonly forbids the baryon violating operators [7]. Obviously, for all these symmetries Rparity is violated. Besides, in string constructions the matter superfields can be located\nin different sectors of the compact space or have different extra U (1) charges, in such\na way that some operators violating R-parity can be forbidden [8], but others can be\nallowed.\nOn the other hand, when R-parity is broken the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)\nis no longer stable. Thus neutralinos or sneutrinos, with very short lifetimes, are no\nlonger candidates for the dark matter (DM) of the Universe. Nevertheless, if the gravitino\nis the LSP its decay is suppressed both by the gravitational interaction and by the small\nR-parity violating coupling, and as a consequence its lifetime can be much longer than\nthe age of the Universe [9]. Thus the gravitino can be in principle a DM candidate\nin R-parity breaking models. This possibility and its phenomenological consequences\nwere studied mainly in the context of bilinear or trilinear R-parity violation scenarios in\n[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. In [11, 13, 14, 16] the prospects for detecting gamma\nrays from decaying gravitinos in satellite experiments were also analyzed. In a recent\nwork [18] we have discussed these issues, gravitino DM and its possible detection in the\nFERMI satellite, in the context of the \u03bc\u03bd SSM. In this talk I will summarize the results\nobtained in this work.\n\nTHE \u03bc\u03bd SSM\nThe superpotential of the \u03bc\u03bd SSM introduced in [1] is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb a c\nb a c\na b \u02c6c\na b c\nW = \u03b5ab Yui j \u0124u Q\u0302i \u00fb j +Ydi j \u0124d Q\u0302i d j +Yei j \u0124d L\u0302i \u00ea j +Y\u03bdi j \u0124u L\u0302i \u03bd\u0302 j\n1\n\u2212 \u03b5 ab \u03bbi \u03bd\u0302ic \u0124da \u0124ub + \u03ba i jk \u03bd\u0302ic \u03bd\u0302 cj \u03bd\u0302kc .\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fIn addition to terms from Lso f t , the tree-level scalar potential receives the D and F term\ncontributions. The final neutral scalar potential can be found in [1, 3]. In the following\nwe will assume for simplicity that all parameters in the potential are real. Once the\nelectroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken, the neutral scalars develop in general\nthe following VEVs:\nhHd0 i = vd ,\n\nhHu0 i = vu ,\n\nh\u03bd\u0303i i = \u03bdi ,\n\nh\u03bd\u0303ic i = \u03bdic .\n\n(2)\n\nFor our computation below we are interested in the neutral fermion mass matrix. As\nexplained in [1, 3], neutralinos mix with the neutrinos and therefore in a basis where\nT\n\u03c7 0 = (B \u03030 , W \u0303 0 , H\u0303d , H\u0303u , \u03bdRi , \u03bdLi ), one obtains the following neutral fermion mass terms\nin the Lagrangian \u2212 21 (\u03c7 0 )T Mn \u03c7 0 + c.c., where\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\nm\nMn =\n,\n(3)\nmT 03\u00d73\nwith M a 7 \u00d7 7 matrix showing the mixing of neutralinos and right-handed neutrinos,\nand m a 7 \u00d7 3 matrix representing the mixing of neutralinos and right- and left-handed\nneutrinos. Both matrices can also be found in [1, 3]. The above 10 \u00d7 10 matrix, Eq. (3),\nis of the seesaw type giving rise to the neutrino masses which have to be very small.\nThis is the case since the entries of the matrix M are much larger than the ones in the\nmatrix m. Notice in this respect that the entries of M are of the order of the electroweak\nscale while the ones in m are of the order of the Dirac masses for the neutrinos [1, 3].\nConcerning the low-energy free parameters of the \u03bc\u03bd SSM in the neutral scalar sector,\nusing the eight minimization conditions for the scalar potential, one can eliminate the\nsoft masses mHd , mHu , meLi , and m\u03bdec in favour of the VEVs vd , vu , \u03bdi , and \u03bdic . On the\ni\nother hand, using the Standard Model Higgs VEV, v \u2248 174 GeV, tan \u03b2 , and \u03bdi , one can\ndetermine the SUSY Higgs VEVs, vd and vu , through v2 = v2d +v2u + \u03bdi2 . We thus consider\nas independent parameters the following set of variables:\n\n\u03bb , \u03ba , tan \u03b2 , \u03bd1 , \u03bd3 , \u03bd c , A\u03bb , A\u03ba , A\u03bd ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have assumed for simplicity that there is no intergenerational mixing in the\nparameters of the model, and that in general they have the same values for the three\nfamilies: \u03bb \u2261 \u03bbi , \u03ba \u2261 \u03baiii , \u03bd c \u2261 \u03bdic , A\u03bb \u2261 A\u03bbi , A\u03ba \u2261 A\u03baiii , A\u03bd \u2261 A\u03bdii . In the case of neutrino\nparameters, following the discussion in [6, 3], we need at least two generations with\ndifferent VEVs and couplings in order to obtain the correct experimental pattern. Thus\nwe have choosen Y\u03bd1 6= Y\u03bd2 = Y\u03bd3 and \u03bd1 6= \u03bd2 = \u03bd3 .\nThe soft SUSY-breaking terms, namely gaugino masses, M1,2,3 , scalar masses,\nmQ\u0303,\u0169c ,d \u0303c ,\u1ebdc , and trilinear parameters, Au,d,e , are also taken as free parameters and\nspecified at low scale.\n\nGRAVITINO DARK MATTER\nLet us now show that the lifetime of the gravitino LSP is typically much longer than the\nage of the Universe in the \u03bc\u03bd SSM, and therefore it can be in principle a candidate for\n\n\fDM. In the supergravity Lagrangian there is an interaction term between the gravitino,\nthe field strength for the photon, and the photino. Since, as discussed above, due to the\nbreaking of R-parity the photino and the left-handed neutrinos are mixed, the gravitino\nwill be able to decay through the interaction term into a photon and a neutrino [9]. Thus\none obtains:\nm3\n1\n2 3/2\n,\n(5)\n\u0393(\u03a83/2 \u2192 \u2211 \u03b3\u03bdi ) \u2243\n| U\u03b3e\u03bd |\n32\u03c0\nMP2\ni\nwhere m3/2 is the gravitino mass, MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV is the reduced Planck mass, and\n|U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 determines the photino content of the neutrino\n3\n\n|U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 = \u2211 |Ni1 cos \u03b8W + Ni2 sin \u03b8W |2 .\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nHere Ni1 (Ni2 ) is the Bino (Wino) component of the i-neutrino.\nThe lifetime of the gravitino can then be written as\n!\n2 \u22121 \u0010\nm3/2 \u0011\u22123\nU\n\u03b3\u0303\u03bd\n.\n\u03c43/2 \u2243 3.8 \u00d7 1027 s\n10 GeV\n10\u221216\n\n(7)\n\nIf |U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 \u223c 10\u221216 \u2212 10\u221212 in order to reproduce neutrino masses, as we will show below,\nthe gravitino will be very long lived as expected (recall that the lifetime of the Universe\nis about 1017 s).\nFor the gravitino to be a good DM candidate we still need to check that it can be\npresent in the right amount to explain the relic density inferred by WMAP, \u03a9DM h2 \u2243 0.1.\nAs it is well known, adjusting the reheating temperature after the inflatinary period of\nthe Universe, one can reproduce the correct relic density for each possible value of the\ngravitino mass. For example for m3/2 of the order of 1 \u2212 1000 GeV, as expected from\nsupergravity scenarios, one obtains \u03a93/2 h2 \u2243 0.1 for TR \u223c 108 \u2212 1011 GeV, with gluino\nmasses of order 1 TeV. It is worth noticing here that even with a high value of TR there\nis no gravitino problem, since the next-to-LSP decays to standard model particles much\nearlier than BBN epoch via R-parity breaking interactions.\nLet us now show that |U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 \u223c 10\u221216 \u2212 10\u221212 in the \u03bc\u03bd SSM. We can easily make an\nestimation [18]. For a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix,\n\u0013\n\u0012\na c\n,\n(8)\nc b\n\nthe mixing angle is given by tan 2\u03b8 = 2c/(a\u2212b). In our case (see Eq. (3) and Refs. [1, 3])\nc \u223c g1 \u03bd \u223c 10\u22124 GeV (represents the mixing of Bino and left handed neutrino), a \u223c 1\nTeV (represents the Bino mass M1 ), and b = 0. Thus one obtains tan 2\u03b8 \u223c 10\u22127 , implying\nsin \u03b8 \u223c \u03b8 \u223c 10\u22127 . This gives |U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 \u223c 10\u221214 .

Constraints on lifetime versus mass for a decaying DM particle, as explained in the text.\n\nGAMMA RAYS FROM GRAVITINO DECAY\nSince in R-parity breaking models the gravitino decays producing a monochromatic\nphoton with an energy m3/2 /2, one can try to extract constraints on the parameter\nspace from gamma-ray observations [9]. Actually, model independent constraints on\nlate DM decays using the gamma rays were studied in [19]. There, the decaying DM\nwas constrained using the gamma-ray line emission limits from the galactic center\nregion obtained with the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL satellite, and the isotropic\ndiffuse photon background as determined from SPI, COMPTEL and EGRET data. These\nconstraints are shown in Fig. 1 (from Ref. [18]), where the region below the magenta\nline is excluded. A conservative non-singular profile at the galactic center is used.\nOn the other hand, the FERMI satellite [20] launched in June 2008 is able to measure\ngamma rays with energies between 0.1 and 300 GeV. We also show in Fig. 1 the\ndetectability of FERMI in the 'annulus' and 'high latitude' regions following the work\nin [13]. Below the lines, FERMI will be able to detect the signal from decaying DM.\nObviously, no signal means that the region would be excluded and FERMI would have\nbeen used to constrain the decay of DM [13].\nFinally, we show in the figure with black solid lines the values of the parameters\npredicted by the \u03bc\u03bd SSM using Eq. (7), for several representative values of |U\u03b3e\u03bd |2\ndiscussed in Eq. (9). We can see that values of the gravitino mass larger than 20 GeV\nare disfavored in this model by the isotropic diffuse photon background observations\n(magenta line). In addition, FERMI will be able to check important regions of the\nparameter space with gravitino mass between 0.1 \u2212 20 GeV and |U\u03b3e\u03bd |2 = 10\u221216 \u2212 10\u221212\n(those below the green line).\nLet us now discuss in more detail [18] what kind of signal is expected to be observed\nby FERMI if the gravitino lifetime and mass in the \u03bc\u03bd SSM (black solid lines) correspond to a point below the green line in Fig. 1\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 2. Expected gamma-ray spectrum for an example of gravitino DM decay in the mid-latitude\n2\n2\n= 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221215, (b) U\u03b3\u03bd\n= 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221215.\nrange in the \u03bc\u03bd SSM with m3/2 = 3.5 GeV and (a) U\u03b3\u03bd\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\nAs it is well known, there are two sources for a diffuse background from DM decay.\nOne is the cosmological diffuse gamma ray coming from extragalactic regions, and the\nother is the one coming from the halo of our galaxy.\nThe photons from cosmological distances are red-shifted during their journey to the\nobserver and the isotropic extragalactic flux can be found in [9, 13]. On the other hand,\nthe photon flux from the galactic halo shows an anisotropic sharp line. For decaying DM\nthis is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n2E\n1\n2\ndJhalo\n\u03b4 1\u2212\n\u03c1halo (~l)d~l ,\n(10)\n; Ahalo =\n= Ahalo\ndE\nmDM\nmDM\n4\u03c0\u03c4DM mDM los\nwhere the halo DM density is integrated along the line of sight, and we will use a NFW\n\u03c1h\n3\nprofile, \u03c1NFW (r) = r/r (1+r/r\n2 , where we take \u03c1h = 0.33 GeV/ cm , rc = 20 kpc, and\nc\nc)\nr is the distance from the center of the galaxy. The latter can be re-expressed using the\ndistance from the Sun, s, in units of R\u2299 = 8.5 kpc (the distance between the Sun and\nthe galactic center) and the galactic coordinates, the longitude, l, and the latitude, b, as\nr2 (s, b, l) = R\u2299 2 [(s \u2212 cos b cos l)2 + (1 \u2212 cos2 b cos2 l)].\nAs an example, let us compute with these formulae the expected diffuse gamma-ray\nemission in the mid-latitude range (10 \u25e6 \u2264 |b| \u2264 20 \u25e6 ), which is being analized by FERMI,\nfor the case of gravitino DM. Let us assume for instance a value of m3/2 = 3.5 GeV\n2\n\nand U\u03b3\u0303\u03bd = 8.8 \u00d7 10\u221215 (1.7 \u00d7 10\u221215 ) in the \u03bc\u03bd SSM, corresponding to \u03c43/2 = 1027\n(5 \u00d7 1027 ) s, using Fig. 1. We convolve the signal with a Gaussian distribution with the\nenergy resolution \u2206E/E = 0.09, between E = 1 \u2212 10 GeV, following [20], and then we\naverage the halo signal over the region for the mid-latitude range mentioned above.\n\n\fThe results for the two examples are shown in Fig. 2, where the green dashed line corresponds to the diffuse extragalactic gamma ray flux, the magenta solid line corresponds\nto the gamma-ray flux from the halo, and the black solid lines represent the conventional\nbackground. The total gamma-ray flux, including background, extragalactic, and line\nsignal, is shown with red solid lines. We can see that the sharp line signal associated\nto an energy half of the gravitino mass, dominates the extragalactic signal and can be a\ndirect measurement (or exclusion) in the FERMI gamma ray observation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI gratefully acknowledge the local organizers of DSU 09 for the wonderful atmosphere\nthat they created.
