This modern day scientific revolution was only\npossible through careful accounting of the various sources of foreground emission and\nabsorption that could have hidden the weak fluctuation signal from the distant past.\nPolarization of the CMB provides information about the universe that is not contained in\nthe temperature data alone. In particular, it offers a unique way to trace the primordial\nperturbations of a tensorial nature (e.g., cosmological gravitational waves), and allows\nbreaking important degeneracies that plague measurement of cosmological parameters\nwith intensity alone (see Zaldarriaga et al. 1997).\nThe polarization of CMB arising from the curl-free polarized E-modes, which required a\nfactor of 100 more sensitivity, has been also reported (Page et al. 2007). The next\nchallenge is the measurement of the signatures of primordial gravitational waves, which\nare predicted to leave a distinct divergence-free, or B-mode, pattern in the large-scale\nCMB polarization anisotropy. The expected signal is already constrained to be an order\nof magnitude smaller than the observed E-mode signal. This level of signal is potentially\ndetectable by the Planck satellite and ground and balloon-based experiments, provided\nthe polarized CMB foregrounds are carefully taken into account. Once B-modes are\ndetected, the research focus will shift to their detailed characterization, which would\nrequire even higher accuracy of the foreground removal process.\nFigure1. Polarized magneto-dipole\nemission from magnetic aligned\ngrains. Upper panel: Polarization of\nthermal emission from perfectly\naligned single domain grains of\nmetallic Fe (solid lines) or\nhypothetical magnetic material that\ncan account for the anomalous\nemission. Lower panel: Polarization\nfrom perfectly aligned grains with\nFe inclusions (filling factor is 0.03).\nGrains are ellipsoidal and the\nresults are shown for various axial\nratios. From Draine & Lazarian\n\nAmong different sources of polarized foregrounds, the one arising from aligned\ninterstellar dust is believed to be the most difficult to correct (see Lazarian & Finkbeiner\n2003, Dunkley et al. 2008). As the degree of dust alignment is known to depend both on\ngrain size and grain composition, this produces a frequency dependence to the dust\n2\n\n\fpolarization. Moreover, in addition to the \"classical\" power-law distribution of large\ngrains (see Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck 1977), dust has a population of tiny grains\n(Leger & Puget 1984), often called PAHs. These tiny grains have been identified by\nDraine & Lazarian (1998) as a source of anomalous emission (Kogut et al. 1996), which\nraises important questions about the possible polarization from this emission mode. In\naddition, aligned grains with inclusions of material with strong magnetic response, are\npredicted to emit polarized magneto-dipole emission with their own complex frequency\ndependent polarization. The polarization may also be very high, exceeding 40% (see\nFigure 1; Draine & Lazarian 1999).\nIn view of the vital importance of separating the CMB polarized signals from the various\npolarized foregrounds, coordinated efforts of observers and theorists are needed to\nestablish reliable constraints on the fraction of microwave polarization arising from the\nforeground dust. Such efforts need only small resources compared to those of a single\nNASA mission. Yet, the improvement in understanding of the properties of the polarized\ndust foreground can substantially improve the quality of modeling and lead to precision\nremoval of the foreground from the critical data from many different CMB experiments.\nThe time is ripe for a breakthrough in this area. First, dramatic improvements in the\nquantity and quality of measured ground-based interstellar polarimetry has been\nachieved from the UV though the submm. Second, there has been a substantial\nimprovement of our understanding of grain alignment (see Lazarian 2007). For the first\ntime, quantitative predictions of grain alignment are possible and are testable by\nobservations (see Whittet et al. 2007). Moreover, progress has been achieved in\nunderstanding the nature of foreground polarization fluctuations (see Fosalba et al.\n2002), for instance, through relating their spatial spectrum to the Kolmogorov-type\nspectrum of the underlying interstellar turbulence (Cho & Lazarian 2002, 2008).\nThese recent successes motivate a strong program of research aimed at quantitative\ndescription of the polarized radiation from dust. The program must combine better high\nsensitivity observations of the polarized emission from dust as well as further improved\nmodeling of polarized microwave emission from dust. The latter can be achieved by\ndedicated testing of the theoretical predictions available.\nExample Polarimetry Science Areas for the next decade\nWithin the area of CMB polarization studies, polarimetry from ground-based\nobservatories at different wavelengths needs to be combined with theoretical studies,\nnumerical modeling and laboratory studies to be able to address the following key\nquestions: What is the wavelength dependence of the foreground polarized microwave\nemission arising from aligned Galactic and Zodiacal dust? What are the statistical\nproperties of polarized emission from Galactic dust? How important is the polarized\nradiation arising from the magneto-dipole emission of strongly magnetic dust grains?\nWhat is the degree of polarization of the anomalous microwave emission? In the\nfollowing, example studies aimed at answering some of these questions are presented.\n\n3\n\n\f\u2022\n\nObservational studies of the wavelength dependency of polarization.\nUnpolarized emission has been well characterized using data from IRAS,\nallowing this emission to be removed from the CMB signal (e.g., Kogut et al. 2007).\nHowever, no all-sky polarization measurements exist to be used to remove Galactic\ndust polarization from CMB observations. In fact, extrapolation of percentage\npolarization from one frequency to another with high accuracy requires sophisticated\nmodeling that employs grain alignment theory. A direct extrapolation of the multitemperature dust model to microwave frequencies suggests a nearly constant\npolarization spectrum, but existing FIR polarization measurements are limited to dense\nclouds. These measurements do show rather complex dependences of polarization\nwith the wavelength, arising from grains at different temperatures aligning differently.\nFuture FIR through mm wavelength observations (especially SOFIA at 50 - 215\n\u03bcm near the dust emission peak, and Planck at 80 - 850 GHz) will target the diffuse\nregions of the ISM, providing valuable input for accurate modeling of microwave\npolarization from dust. The synergy of the ground-based and SOFIA observations with\nthe Planck mission, which uses a wider frequency range (80 - 850 GHz) should provide\npolarization radiation templates and important constraints for grain alignment theory.\n\u2022\n\nConstructing models of polarized microwave dust emission\nIf the composition of grains is known, their polarization depends on the grain\nshape and grain alignment. The latter is the more complex effect. One may expect\nvariations of alignment depending on grain environment, which can introduce\nsubstantial variations of the polarization with frequency. Therefore, it is essential to\nprovide extensive testing of grain alignment. This can be performed at many different\nwavelengths, including optical and near infrared.\nModern grain alignment theory is based on radiative torques. The efficiency of\nthose decreases as the grain size gets small compared to the radiation wavelength. As\na result, small grains are not expected to align well; the cut-off size of aligned grains\ndepends on the intensity, as well as the spectrum and degree of anisotropy of the\nradiation illuminating the dust grain. The measurements of polarization (Whittet et al.\n2008; Hildebrand et al. 2000) agree well with simple modeling. However, more detailed,\nmulti-frequency, measurements of polarization are required.\nTheoretical modeling also should be improved. For instance, an additional\ndependence, not yet included in any modeling of polarization to date, is on the angle\nbetween the direction of anisotropic flux of photons and the magnetic field (Lazarian &\nHoang 2007). Understanding how the aligned grains size distribution depends on\nenvironment is one of the key goals for quantitative modeling of dust polarization. The\ncorrect degree of polarization is another input parameter needing theoretical\nexploration. We discuss this below.\n\n\u2022\n\nDetermining Degree of Alignment and Presence of Strongly Magnetic Grains\n4\n\n\fThe theory predicts the degree of paramagnetic grain alignment as a function\nof the angle between the direction between the anisotropic flux of photons that align\ngrain and the magnetic field (Lazarian & Hoang 2007). However, if grains have strongly\nmagnetic inclusions (see above) the degree of alignment is 100% and does not change\nwith the aforementioned angle (Lazarian & Hoang 2008). A dedicated program of\nobservations and simulations can distinguish the two cases and provide constraints on\nthe presence of the strongly magnetic grains or strongly magnetic inclusions in\ninterstellar grains.\nIf grains are strongly magnetic they will exhibit 100% alignment and this will\nincrease the modeled polarization values for frequencies larger than 100 Ghz. However,\nthis will mean that in the range of 20-100~Ghz, additional polarized magneto-dipole\nemission is expected1.\nRecent observational probing of grain alignment (Andersson & Potter 2007)\nshows that observational testing of the predictions is feasible in the optical and infrared\nranges. A dedicated program of multi-frequency high-resolution observations, combined\nwith modeling of the 3D distribution of the radiation sources, i.e. stars, is required to test\ngrain alignment theory, solve this long-standing (60 years old!) puzzle, and provide an\naccurate model of dust polarization.\n\u2022\n\nFinding the polarization of spinning dust emission\nThe existing theory of PAHs alignment predicts marginal degrees of alignment for\ngrains rotating at higher than 30 Ghz frequencies (Lazarian & Draine 2000). Testing can\nbe performed in the microwave and in the IR, as the smallest grains will emit there. This\nrequires new instruments and new polarimetric studies. Laboratory studies of the\nparamagnetic response of the PAHs are also needed in order to test the effect of\nresonance paramagnetic relaxation predicted in Lazarian & Draine (2000).\n\u2022\n\nRole of Laboratory studies\nNot only the paramagnetic response of PAHs requires additional studies. The\npredictions of the magneto-dipole emission in Draine & Lazarian (1999) are based on\ndata on magnetic response at microwave frequencies that they could get from the\nliterature. The necessity of more precise predictions calls for dedicated laboratory\nstudies of microwave response of candidate magnetic materials.\n\u2022\n\nDetermining the statistics of interstellar dust polarization\nTo separate the CMB polarization signal and polarized foreground contribution\narising from aligned dust, it is important to know the expected statistical properties of\nthe foreground polarized emission. Those can be evaluated from the statistics of the\nstarlight polarization (Fosalba et al. 2002), provided that the difference in the sampling\nof volume with aligned grains by stars and the microwave emission is taken into\naccount. Multi-frequency observations of the polarized emission provide another way of\n1\n\nEven paramagnetic grains are expected to emit polarized magneto-dipole emission, although at a lower rate\n(Draine & Lazarian 1999). This emission in the range below 100 Ghz will become important as CMB polarization\nmeasurements get more precise.\n\n5\n\n\fseparating the CMB and foreground polarization. Studies of the statistics of the starlight\npolarization in Cho & Lazarian (2002, 2008) showed that the underlying spectrum of\nmagnetic fluctuations, those that have the largest influence on the variations of the\npolarization degree in diffuse media, is consistent with the Kolmogorov-type spectrum.\nThe deviation in the value of the spectral index of the polarization fluctuations obtained\nin Fosalba et al. (2004) from the standard 5/3 Kolmogorov value was shown to arise\nfrom the volume sampling by stars, the majority of which are close to the observer.\nBetter star polarization surveys, e.g. the one by Clemens et al. (2009) as well as farinfrared polarimetry studies of individual molecular clouds should allow for accurate\ntesting of the hypothesis of the Kolmogorov spectrum of dust polarization. The\nknowledge of the underlying spatial polarization spectrum of emission arising from dust\nshould help to separating its contribution from that of B-modes of CMB.\nBroad Impact: Synergy of studying CMB polarization and interstellar\nmagnetic fields\nWhile measuring the polarization of CMB B-modes is a challenging problem\nalong the path toward understanding the early universe, the detailed mapping of\nmagnetic fields is another challenging problem, but one needed for understanding the\nrole of the field in many astrophysical processes, including the propagation of cosmic\nrays, star formation, and heating of the interstellar gas. Tracing magnetic fields with\naligned grains provides a unique window for revealing magnetic fields in diffuse\ninterstellar gas and molecular clouds. Resolving the remaining uncertainties related to\ngrain alignment as well as obtaining high-density maps of magnetic fields in dense gas,\nand, importantly, in high latitude diffuse gas, will shed light on the many astrophysicallyimportant effects of magnetic fields.\n\nContext: Polarimetry as a cross-cutting enterprise\nPolarimetry is practiced across the full range of accessible wavelengths, from\nlong wavelength radio through gamma rays, to provide windows into phenomena not\nopen to photometry, spectroscopy, or their time-resolved variants. At some\nwavelengths, the U.S. leads the world in polarimetric capabilities and investigations,\nincluding ground-based radio, through the VLA and VLBA. At other wavelengths, the\nU.S. is currently competitive: in submm the CSO and the JCMT have historically\npursued similar science problems.\nIn ground-based O/IR, the situation is considerably worse, with no optical or NIR\npolarimeters available on Gemini (Michelle is MIR, only) or any NOAO-accessed 4 m\ntelescope, as the table below shows. Over the past decade and more, Canadian and\nEuropean astronomers have enjoyed unique access to state-of-the-art polarimeters and\nhave used this access to vault far past the U.S. in many science areas.\nPhotometry, spectroscopy, and polarimetry together comprise the basic toolbox\nastronomers use to discover the nature of the universe. Polarimetry established the\nUnified Model of AGN and continues to yield unique and powerful insight into complex\nphenomena. Polarimetry reveals the elusive magnetic field in the Milky Way and\nexternal galaxies, allows mapping of features of unresolved stars and supernovae,\n6\n\n\funcovers nearby exoplanets and faint circumstellar disks, and probes acoustic\noscillations of the early universe.\nTelescope\n\nAperture\n\nInstrument\n\nWaveband\n\nPolar.

Neither the Spitzer Space Telescope nor JWST provides,\nor will provide, any polarimetric capability.\nThe dwindling U.S. access to this crucial third leg of the light analysis tripod has\nalso become self-fulfilling, as students receive little exposure to polarimetric techniques\nand scientific advances as the number of practitioners able to teach students declines.\nFinal Thought\nThe U.S. astronomical community has lost opportunities to advance key science\nareas as a result of down-selects of instrument capabilities or lack of will to commission\npolarimetric modes on instruments. The investment is minor, the expertise is available\nin the community, and the rewards are tangible. We are excited by the recent\nmomentum favoring polarimetric studies and capabilities and believe the upcoming\ndecade will see the various polarimetric techniques together become a strong,\nnecessary component of astronomers' light analysis toolbox. In terms of achieving\nprogress in modeling polarized microwave emission, we argued above that dedicated\nefforts involving multi-frequency polarimetry, including optical and infrared polarimetry\nare required.\nBibliography and References\nAndersson, B.-G., & Potter, S.
