Baker 1\nSchool of Mathematics\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\nAtlanta, GA 30332-0160\nmbaker@math.gatech.edu\nThe game. Alice and Bob decide to play the following infinite game on\nthe real number line. A subset S of the unit interval [0, 1] is fixed, and then\nAlice and Bob alternate playing real numbers. Alice moves first, choosing\nany real number a1 strictly between 0 and 1. Bob then chooses any real\nnumber b1 strictly between a1 and 1. On each subsequent turn, the players\nmust choose a point strictly between the previous two choices. Equivalently,\nif we let a0 = 0 and b0 = 1, then in round n \u2265 1, Alice chooses a real number\nan with an\u22121 < an < bn\u22121 , and then Bob chooses a real number bn with\nan < bn < bn\u22121 . Since a monotonically increasing sequence of real numbers\nwhich is bounded above has a limit (see [8, Theorem 3.14]), \u03b1 = limn\u2192\u221e an\nis a well-defined real number between 0 and 1. Alice wins the game if \u03b1 \u2208 S,\nand Bob wins if \u03b1 6\u2208 S.\nCountable and uncountable sets. An set X is called countable if it is\npossible to list the elements of X in a (possibly repeating) infinite sequence\nx1 , x2 , x3 , . . . Equivalently, X is countable if there is a function from the set\n{1, 2, 3, . . .} of natural numbers to X which is onto. For example, every\nfinite set is countable, and the set of natural numbers is countable. A set\nwhich is not countable is called uncountable. Cantor proved using his famous\ndiagonalization argument that the real interval [0, 1] is uncountable. We will\ngive a different proof of this fact based on Alice and Bob's game.\nProposition 1. If S is countable, then Bob has a winning strategy.\n1\n\nSupported by NSF Grant DMS-0300784.\n\n1\n\n\fProof. Since S is countable, one can enumerate the elements of S as\ns1 , s2 , s3 , . . . Consider the following strategy for Bob. On move n \u2265 1, he\nchooses bn = sn if this is a legal move, and otherwise he randomly chooses\nany allowable number for bn . Since \u03b1 < bn for all n, it follows that \u03b1 6= bn\nfor any n \u2265 1, and thus \u03b1 6\u2208 S. This means that Bob always wins with this\nstrategy!\nIf S = [0, 1], then clearly Alice wins no matter what either player does.\nTherefore we deduce:\nCorollary 1. The interval [0, 1] \u2282 R is uncountable.\nThis argument is in many ways much simpler than Cantor's original proof!\nPerfect sets. We now prove a generalization of the fact that [0, 1] is uncountable. This will also follow from an analysis of our game, but the analysis\nis somewhat more complicated. Given a subset X of [0, 1], we make the following definitions:\n\u2022 A limit point of X is a point x \u2208 [0, 1] such that for every \u01eb > 0, the\nopen interval (x \u2212 \u01eb, x + \u01eb) contains an element of X other than x.\n\u2022 X is closed if every limit point of X belongs to X.\n\u2022 X is perfect if it is non-empty 2 , closed, and if every element of X is a\nlimit point of X.\nFor example, the famous middle-third Cantor set is perfect (see [8, \u00a72.44]).\nIf L(X) denotes the set of limit points of X, then a nonempty set X is closed\n\u21d4 L(X) \u2286 X, and is perfect \u21d4 L(X) = X. It is a well-known fact that\nevery perfect set is uncountable (see [8, Theorem 2.43]). Using our infinite\ngame, we will give a different proof of this fact. We recall the following basic\nproperty of the interval [0, 1]:\n2\n\nSome authors consider the empty set to be perfect.\n\n2\n\n\f(\u22c6) Every non-empty subset X \u2286 [0, 1] has an infimum (or greatest lower\nbound), meaning that there exists a real number \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1] such that\n\u03b3 \u2264 x for every x \u2208 X, and if \u03b3 \u2032 \u2208 [0, 1] is any real number with \u03b3 \u2032 \u2264 x\nfor every x \u2208 X, then \u03b3 \u2032 \u2264 \u03b3.\nThe infimum \u03b3 of X is denoted by inf(X).\nLet's say that a point x \u2208 [0, 1] is approachable from the right, denoted\nx \u2208 X + , if for every \u01eb > 0, the open interval (x, x + \u01eb) contains an element\nof X. We can define approachable from the left (written x \u2208 X \u2212 ) similarly\nusing the interval (x \u2212 \u01eb, x). It is easy to see that L(X) = X + \u222a X \u2212 , so that\na non-empty set X is perfect \u21d4 X = X + \u222a X \u2212 .\nThe following two lemmas tell us about approachability in perfect sets.\nLemma 1. If S is perfect, then inf(S) \u2208 S + .\nProof. The definition of the infimum in (\u22c6) implies that inf(S) cannot be\napproachable from the left, so, being a limit point of S, it must be approachable from the right.\nLemma 2. If S is perfect and a \u2208 S + , then for any \u01eb > 0, the open\ninterval (a, a + \u01eb) also contains an element of S + .\nProof. Since a \u2208 S + , we can choose three points x, y, z \u2208 S with a < x <\ny < z < a + \u01eb. Since (x, z) \u2229 S contains y, the real number \u03b3 = inf((x, z) \u2229 S)\nsatisfies x \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 y. If \u03b3 = x, then by (\u22c6) we have \u03b3 \u2208 S + . If \u03b3 > x, then\n(\u22c6) implies that \u03b3 \u2208 L(X) and (x, \u03b3) \u2229 S = \u2205, so that \u03b3 6\u2208 S \u2212 and therefore\n\u03b3 \u2208 S +.\nFrom these lemmas, we deduce:\nProposition 2. If S is perfect, then Alice has a winning strategy.\nProof. Alice's only constraint on her nth move is that an\u22121 < an < bn\u22121 .\nBy induction, it follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 that Alice can always choose\nan to be an element of S + \u2286 S. Since S is closed, \u03b1 = lim an \u2208 S, so Alice\nwins!\nFrom Propositions 1 and 2, we deduce:\nCorollary 2. Every perfect set is uncountable.\n3\n\n\fFurther analysis of the game. We know from Proposition 1 that Bob has\na winning strategy if S is countable, and it follows from Proposition 2 that\nAlice has a winning strategy if S contains a perfect set. (Alice just chooses\nall of her numbers from the perfect subset.) What can one say in general?\nA well-known result from set theory [1, \u00a76.2, Exercise 5] says that every\nuncountable Borel set 3 contains a perfect subset. Thus we have completely\nanalyzed the game when S is a Borel set: Alice wins if S is uncountable, and\nBob wins if S is countable. However, there do exist non-Borel uncountable\nsubsets of [0, 1] which do not contain a perfect subset [1, Theorem 6.3.7]. So\nwe leave the reader with the following problem:\nProblem: Do there exist uncountable subsets of [0, 1] for which: (a) Bob\nhas a winning strategy; (b) Alice does not have a winning strategy; or (c)\nneither Alice nor Bob has a winning strategy?\nRelated games. Our infinite game is a slight variant of the one proposed\nby Jerrold Grossman and Barry Turett in [2] (see also [6]). Propositions 1 and\n2 above were motivated by parts (a) and (c), respectively, of their problem.\nThe author originally posed Propositions 1 and 2 as challenge problems for\nthe students in his Math 25 class at Harvard University in Fall 2000.\nA related game (the \"Choquet game\") can be used to prove the Baire\ncategory theorem (see \u00a78.C of [5] and [3]). In Choquet's game, played in a\ngiven metric space X, Pierre moves first by choosing a non-empty open set\nU1 \u2286 X. Then Paul moves by choosing a non-empty open set V1 \u2286 U1 . Pierre\nthen chooses a non-empty open set U2 \u2286 V1 , etc., yielding two decreasing\nsequences Un and Vn of non-empty open sets with Un \u2287 Vn \u2287 Un+1 for all n,\nand \u2229Un = \u2229Vn . Pierre wins if \u2229Un = \u2205, and Paul wins if \u2229Un 6= \u2205. One\ncan show that if X is complete, then Paul has a winning strategy, and if X\ncontains a non-empty open set O which is a countable union of closed sets\n3\n\nA Borel set is, roughly speaking, any subset of [0, 1] that can be constructed by taking\ncountably many unions, intersections, and complements of open intervals; see [8, \u00a711.11]\nfor a formal definition.\n\n4\n\n\fhaving empty interior, then Pierre has a winning strategy. As a consequence,\none obtains the Baire category theorem: If X is a complete metric space, then\nno open subset of X can be a countable union of closed sets having empty\ninterior.\nAnother related game is the Banach-Mazur game (see \u00a76 of [7] and \u00a78.H\nof [5]). A subset S of the unit interval [0, 1] is fixed, and then Anna and\nBartek alternate play. First Anna chooses a closed interval I1 \u2286 [0, 1], and\nthen Bartek chooses a closed interval I2 \u2286 I1 . Next, Anna chooses a closed\ninterval I3 \u2286 I2 , and so on. Together the players' moves determine a nested\nsequence In of closed intervals. Anna wins if \u2229In has at least one point in\ncommon with S, otherwise Bartek wins. It can be shown that Bartek has\na winning strategy if and only if S is meagre (see Theorem 6.1 of [7]). (A\nsubset of X is called nowhere dense if the interior of its closure is empty, and\nis called meagre, or of the first category, if it is a countable union of nowhere\ndense sets.) It can also be shown, using the axiom of choice, that there exist\nsets S for which the Banach-Mazur game is undetermined (neither player has\na winning strategy).\nFor a more thorough discussion of these and many other topological games,\nwe refer the reader to the survey article [9], which contains an extensive\nbibliography. Many of the games discussed in [9] are not yet completely\nunderstood.\nGames like the ones we have been discussing play a prominent role in\nthe modern field of descriptive set theory, most notably in connection with\nthe axiom of determinacy (AD). (See Chapter 6 of [4] for a more detailed\ndiscussion.) Let X be a given subset of the space \u03c9 \u03c9 of infinite sequences of\nnatural numbers, and consider the following game between Alice and Bob.\nAlice begins by playing a natural number, then Bob plays another (possibly\nthe same) natural number, then Alice again plays a natural number, and so\non. The resulting sequence of moves determines an element x \u2208 \u03c9 \u03c9 . Alice\nwins if x \u2208 X, and Bob wins otherwise. The axiom of determinacy states\nthat this game is determined (i.e., one of the players has a winning strategy)\n5\n\n\ffor every choice of X.\nA simple construction shows that the axiom of determinacy is inconsistent\nwith the axiom of choice. On the other hand, with Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory plus the axiom of determinacy (ZF+AD), one can prove many nontrivial theorems about the real numbers, including: (i) every subset of R\nis Lebesgue measurable; and (ii) every uncountable subset of R contains a\nperfect subset. Although ZF+AD is not considered a \"realistic\" alternative\nto ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel + axiom of choice), it has stimulated a lot of\nmathematical research, and certain variants of AD are taken rather seriously.\nFor example, the axiom of projective determinacy is intimately connected\nwith the continuum hypothesis and the existence of large cardinals (see [10]\nfor details).\n\nReferences\n[1] K.
