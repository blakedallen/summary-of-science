In this short note, we give simple proofs of several results and\nconjectures formulated by Stolarsky and Tran concerning generating functions\nof some families of Chebyshev-like polynomials.\n\n1. Introduction\nStolarsky [5] observed that the discriminant of the product of the polynomials\nKs (x, y) = (1 + y)2s + xy s\n\nand fm (y) = (y 2m+1 \u2212 1)/(y \u2212 1)\n\nhas a very nice factorization:\n(s) 2s\u22121\n(s)\n\u2206y (Ks fm ) = Cm\nx\n(x + 22s )Hm\n(x)4 ,\n\n(1.1)\n\n(s)\n\n(s)\n\nwith Cm a rational constant and Hm (x) the following polynomial in Q[x]:\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\nm \u0012\nY\nk\u03c0\ns\n2s\n(s)\n.\n(1.2)\nHm (x) =\nx + 4 cos\n2m + 1\nk=1\n\nThis was obtained empirically for specific values of m and s. Moreover, Stolarsky\n(s)\nconjectured that the generating functions of the polynomials Hm for fixed positive\ninteger s are rational, with explicit empirical formulas for s = 1, 2, 3. In [6], Tran\n(s)\nproved Eq. (1.1) with the explicit value Cm = (\u22121)m (2m+1)2m\u22121 s2s and obtained\n(1)\n(2)\nthe generating function of the sequences of polynomials Hm (x) and Hm (x).\n(s)\nIndeed, for s = 1, the polynomials Hm (x) are related to the classical Chebyshev\npolynomials of the second kind Un (x).

We generalize these results by proving:\nP\n(s)\nTheorem 1. For any s \u2265 1, the generating function Fs (x, t) = m\u22650 Hm (x)tm\nbelongs to Q(x, t). Its denominator has degree at most 2s in t, and its numerator\nhas degree at most 2s \u2212 1 in t.\nMoreover, we give an algorithm that computes these rational functions explicitly.\nIn Section 2, we prove this theorem. In Section 3, we comment on the computational\naspects. We conclude with a few further observations in Section 4.\n2.

Polynomials, Recurrences and Hadamard Products. A consequence\n(1)\nof Proposition 1 is that the sequence of polynomials Gm (x) satisfies the linear\nrecurrence\n(2.2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nGm+2 (x) + (2 \u2212 x)Gm+1 (x) + G(1)\nm (x) = 0,\n\nG0 (x) = 1, G1 (x) = x \u2212 1.\n\nThe coefficients of this recurrence are constant, in the sense that they do not depend\n(1)\non the index m. The characteristic polynomial of the sequence Gm (x) is the\nreciprocal t2 + (2 \u2212 x)t + 1 of the denominator of its generating function.\nConversely, any sequence satisfying a linear recurrence with constant coefficients\nadmits a rational generating function and this applies in particular to the sequence\n(1)\nof polynomials Gm (\u03b5js x) for any j \u2265 0.\nThe product of sequences un and vn that are solutions of linear recurrences with\nconstant coefficients satisfies a linear recurrence with constant coefficients again\n(see, e.g., [7, \u00a72.4], [4, Prop. 4.2.5], [2, \u00a72, Ex. 5]). Its generating function, called\nthe Hadamard product of those of un and vn , is therefore rational. From Eq. (2.1),\nP\n(s)\nit follows that the generating function m\u22650 Gm (xs )tm is also rational (a priori\nbelonging to C(x, t)).\nMoreover, the reciprocal of the denominator of a Hadamard product of rational\nseries has for roots the pairwise products of those of the individual series. Thus, letting \u03b11 (x), \u03b12 (x) denote the roots of (1 + t)2 \u2212 xt, the reciprocal of the denominator\n(s)\nof the generating function of (\u22121)m(s\u22121) * Gm (xs ) is the characteristic polynomial\n\u0011\n\u0010\nY\nPs (x, t) =\nt \u2212 \u03b1i1 (x)\u03b1i2 (\u03b5s x) * * * \u03b1is (\u03b5ss\u22121 x) .\n1\u2264i1 ,...,is \u22642\n\nNote that, since \u03b11 * \u03b12 = 1, the polynomial Ps is self-reciprocal with respect to t.\nWe prove that the polynomial Ps (x, t) belongs to Q[xs , t] by showing that all the\n(Newton) powersums of the roots of Ps (x, t) belong to Q[xs ]. For any l \u2208 N, the\nl-th powersum is equal to the product\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2.3)\n\u03b1l1 (x) + \u03b1l2 (x) \u03b1l1 (\u03b5s x) + \u03b1l2 (\u03b5s x) * * * \u03b1l1 (\u03b5ss\u22121 x) + \u03b1l2 (\u03b5ss\u22121 x) ,\n\nand thus has the form Tl,s (x) = Ql (x)Ql (\u03b5s x) * * * Ql (\u03b5ss\u22121 x) for some polynomial\nQl (x) \u2208 Q[x]. The polynomial Tl,s (x) being left unchanged under replacing x by\n\u03b5s x, it belongs to Q[xs ], and so do all the coefficients of Ps . This can also be seen\nfrom the expression of Tl,s as a resultant: Tl,s (x) = Resy (y s \u2212 xs , Ql (y)).\n(s)\nIn conclusion, Gm (xs ) satisfies a recurrence with coefficients that are polynomiP\n(s)\nals in Q[xs ], thus the series m\u22650 Gm (xs )tm is rational and belongs to Q(xs , t),\nand thus Fs (x, t) belongs to Q(x, t). The assertion on the degree in t of (the denominator and numerator of) Fs (x, t) follows from the form of Ps (x, t). This concludes\nthe proof of Theorem 1.\n\n3. Algorithm\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is actually effective, and therefore it can be used to generate, for specific values of s, the corresponding rational function Fs , in a systematic\nand unified way.\n\n\f4\n\nA. BOSTAN, B. SALVY, AND K. TRAN\n\n3.1. New Proof for the Case s = 2. We illustrate these ideas in the simplest\ncase s = 2, for which the computations can be done by hand.\n(2)\n(1)\n(1)\nWe compute the generating function of km (x) := Hm (\u2212x2 ) = Gm (x)Gm (\u2212x)\n(2)\nfrom which that of the sequence Hm (x) is easily deduced. By Proposition 1, the\n(1)\n(1)\ngenerating functions of the sequences Gm (x) and Gm (\u2212x) have for denominators\ng1 (t) := (1 + t)2 \u2212 xt,\n\ng2 (t) := (1 + t)2 + xt,\n\nwhich are self-reciprocal. The polynomial whose roots are the products of the roots\nof g1 and g2 is obtained by a resultant computation:\nResu (g1 (u), u2 g2 (t/u)) = (t\u22121)4 +x2 t(1+t)2 = 1+(x2 \u22124)t+(2x2 +6)t2 +(x2 \u22124)t3 +t4 .\nIt follows that the sequence km (x) satisfies the fourth order recurrence\nkm+4 + (x2 \u2212 4)km+3 + (2x2 + 6)km+2 + (x2 \u2212 4)km+1 + km = 0.\nThe initial conditions can be determined separately\nk0 = 1, k1 = 1 \u2212 x2 , k2 = 1 \u2212 7x2 + x4 , k3 = 1 \u2212 26x2 + 13x4 \u2212 x6\nand used to compute the numerator of the generating function of the sequence of\n(2)\npolynomials Hm (x). In conclusion, we have just proven the identity\n(3.1)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(2)\nHm\n(x)tm =\n\nm=0\n\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n.\n(t \u2212 1)4 \u2212 xt(t + 1)2\n\nThis provides a simple alternative proof of [6, Prop. 4.1].\n3.2. General Algorithm. The computation of Hadamard products extends to\nlinear recurrences that can even have polynomial coefficients. It is implemented in\nthe Maple package gfun [3]. This makes it possible to write a first implementation\n(s)\nthat produces the generating function of the Hm (x) for small s.\nThe computation can be made more efficient by using recent algorithms specific\nto linear recurrences with constant coefficients [1] (or, equivalently, to rational functions). The central idea is to avoid the use of a general-purpose algorithm for the\ncomputation of bivariate resultants and recover the denominator from the (Newton) powersums of its roots, themselves obtained from the powersums of \u03b11 and \u03b12 .\nUsing very simple univariate resultants, computations in algebraic extensions can\nbe avoided. This is summarized in the following algorithm that follows the steps of\nthe constructive proof of Thm. 1, using efficient algorithmic tools.\nInput: an integer s \u2265 2.\nOutput: the rational function Fs (x, t).\n(1) Compute the powersums Ql (x) := \u03b11 (x)l + \u03b12 (x)l \u2208 Q[x] for l = 0, . . . , 2s ;\n(2) Compute the powersums Tl,s from Eq.

Further Remarks\n(s)\n\nWhile computing with the polynomials Hm we experimentally discovered the\nfollowing amusing facts.\nFact 1. For all s \u2265 1, we have:\n(s)\n\nH0 (x) = 1,\n(s)\n\nH1 (x) = x + 1,\n(s)\n\nH2 (x) = x2 + L2s x + 1,\nwhere Ln denotes the n-th element of the Lucas sequence defined by L0 = 2, L1 = 1\nand Ln = Ln\u22121 + Ln\u22122 for all n \u2265 2.\nThis is easy to prove.\n(s)\n\nFact 2. Hm (x) has only non-negative integer coefficients, for all m \u2265 0 and s \u2265 1.\n\n\f6\n\nA. BOSTAN, B. SALVY, AND K. TRAN\n\nNon-negativity is clear from (1.2), while the integrality follows from the generat(s)\ning function when s = 1 and from the resultant representation of Hm for higher s.\n(s)\n\nFact 2 suggests that the coefficients of the polynomials Hm (x) could admit a\nnice combinatorial interpretation.\n(s)\nFor instance, the coefficient of x1 in Hm (x) is equal to the trace of the matrix\nM 2s , where M = (ai,j )m\ni,j=1 is the m \u00d7 m matrix with ai,j = 1 for i + j \u2264 m + 1\nand ai,j = 0 otherwise.\nP\n(s)\nFact 3. The rational function Fs (x, t) = m\u22650 Hm (x)tm writes Ns (x, t)/Ds (x, t),\nwhere Ns (x, t) is a polynomial in Q[x, t] of degree 2s \u2212 1 in t and Bs\u22121 \u2212 1 in x,\nDs (x, t) is a polynomial in Q[x, t] of degree 2s in t and Bs\u22121 in x, and where Bn\nis the central binomial coefficient\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\nBn =\n.\n\u230an/2\u230b\nHere is the sketch of a proof. We only prove upper bounds, but a finer analysis\ncould lead to the exact degrees.\nFirst, it is enough to show that the degree in x of the polynomial Ps (x, t) defined\nin the proof of Theorem 1 is at most sBs\u22121 . Now, instead of considering Ps , we\nstudy the simpler polynomial\n\u0011\n\u0010\nY\nCs (x, t) =\nt \u2212 \u03b1i1 (x)\u03b1i2 (x) * * * \u03b1is (x) .\n1\u2264i1 ,...,is \u22642\n\nWe will prove the bound sBs\u22121 on the degree of Cs in x. Adapting the argument\nto the case of Ps is not difficult.\nThe starting point is that, when x tends to infinity, \u03b11 (x) grows like x, while\n\u03b12 (x) grows like x\u22121 . Therefore,\ns \u0010\n\u0011(ks)\nY\nCs (x, t) =\nt \u2212 \u03b11s\u2212k (x)\u03b1k2 (x)\nk=0\n\ngrows like Ls (x, t) =\n\nQs\n\nk=0\n\n\u0010\n\ns\u2212k\n\nt\u2212x\n\n\u22121 k\n\n(x\n\n)\n\n\u0011(ks)\n\n. The degree in x of Cs (x, t) is thus\n\nbounded by the degree in x of the Laurent polynomial Ls (x, t), which is equal to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u230as/2\u230b \u0012 \u0013\nX s\n\u0001\ns\ndegx (Ls ) =\n(s \u2212 2k) =\n* \u230as/2\u230b + 1 = sBs\u22121 .\nk\n\u230as/2\u230b + 1\nk=0\n\nAppendix: Maple Code\nFor completeness, we give a self-contained Maple implementation that produces\nthe rational form of the generating function Fs (x, t).\nrecipoly:=proc(p,t) expand(t^degree(p,t)*subs(t=1/t,p)) end:\nnewtonsums:=proc(p,t,ord)\nlocal pol, dpol;\npol:=p/lcoeff(p,t);\npol:=recipoly(pol,t);\ndpol:=recipoly(diff(pol,t),t);\n\n\fCHEBYSHEV-LIKE POLYNOMIALS\n\n7\n\nmap(expand,series(dpol/pol,t,ord))\nend:\ninvnewtonsums:=proc(S,t,ord) series(exp(Int((coeff(S,t,0)-S)/t,t)),t,ord) end:\nFs:=proc(s,x,t)\nlocal H, G, N, Q, T, ell, y, Ps, Ds, G1, Gs, m, Ns;\nH:=(1-t)/((1-t)^2-x*t);\nG:=subs(x=-x,t=-t,H);\nN:=2^s;\nQ:=subs(x=y,newtonsums(denom(G),t,N+1));\nT:=series(add(resultant(y^s-x,coeff(Q,t,ell),y)*t^ell,ell=0..N),t,N+1);\nPs:=convert(invnewtonsums(T,t,N+1),polynom);\nDs:=subs(t=(-1)^s*t,x=-x,Ps); # denominator\nG1:=subs(x=y,series(G,t,N));\nGs:=series(add(resultant(coeff(G1,t,m),x-y^s,y)*t^m,m=0..N),t,N);\nNs:=convert(series(Ds*subs(x=-x,t=-t,Gs),t,N),polynom); # numerator\ncollect(Ns/Ds,x,factor)\nend:\nReferences\n[1] Alin Bostan, Philippe Flajolet, Bruno Salvy, and \u00c9ric Schost.
