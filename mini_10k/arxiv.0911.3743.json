The source was monitored in the 20\u201360 keV energy band\nduring the first year of the mission from 2007 July 17 to 2008 August 31, covering about one whole orbital period and three more pre-periastron passages for a total net observation time of about 3.7 Ms. The SuperAGILE\ndataset represents one of the most continuous and complete monitoring at hard X-ray energies of the 41.5 day\nlong binary period available to date.\nThe source behavior was characterized at all orbital phases in terms of hard X-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin\nperiod history, pulsed fraction and pulse shape profile. We also complemented the SuperAGILE observations\nwith the soft X-ray data of the RossiXTE/ASM. Our analysis shows a clear orbital modulation of the spectral\nhardness, with peaks in correspondence with the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. The hardness peaks\nwe found could be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order to explain the orbital\nlight curve modulation of GX 301-2.\nTiming analysis of the pulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the \u223c680 s pulse period is consistent\nwith the previous observations, although there is evidence of a slight decrease in the spin-down rate. The\nanalysis of the hard X-ray pulsed emission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of the\norbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron, and a clear modulation of the\npulsed fraction, which appears in turn strongly anti-correlated with the source intensity.\nSubject headings: pulsars: individual: GX 3012 stars: neutron X-rays: binaries\n1.

The X-ray source was discovered in 1969 April\n(Lewin et al. 1971) with a balloon observation, subsequently\nWhite et al. (1976) discovered the 700 s X-ray pulsation. The\npulsar orbit has an eccentricity of 0.462 (Koh et al. 1997) and\na period of \u223c41.5 days (White et al. 1978; Sato et al. 1986;\nKoh et al. 1997; Doroshenko et al. 2008). The mass function of the system is 31.1 M\u2299 with a companion mass in the\nrange 39 < M < 53 M\u2299 , estimated by the measurement of\noptical radial velocity amplitude (Kaper et al. 2006). The radius of Wray 977 obtained by Kaper et al. (2006) by fitting\natmosphere model is 62 R\u2299 , while the effective temperature is\nabout 1.8 \u00d7 104 K.\nGX 301-2 shows regular X-ray flares about two days before\nthe periastron passage, while a secondary intensity peak was\nsometimes observed near the apastron passage (Pravdo et al.\n1995; Koh et al. 1997; Pravdo & Ghosh 2001). Assuming a\ndistance of 3 kpc, as derived by Kaper et al. (2006), the source\nluminosity during pre-periastron (PP) flares reaches values\nof \u223c 1037 erg s\u22121 , about 25 times larger than the luminosity\nshowed by the source in the other orbital phases.\nSince its discovery, GX 301-2 exhibited unpredictable\ntorque variations superimposed on a secular spin trend,\nwhich passed from a spin-up to a spin-down state between\nMJD 48500 and MJD 49500. Two rapid spin-up episodes\nwith \u03bd\u0307 \u223c 2\u20135 \u00d7 10\u221212 Hz s\u22121 were also found by Koh et al.\n(1997) analyzing BATSE data, thus confirming the erratic behavior of the pulsar spin period. Koh et al. (1997) suggested\nthat the long-term spin-up trend observed between 1984 and\n1994 might not be regular and continuous, but due to sev-\n\n\f2\n\nEvangelista et al.\n\neral rapid spin-up episodes, which in turn could be related to\nthe formation of a temporary accretion disk. Pravdo & Ghosh\n(2001), using BATSE data, found evidence that the hard X-ray\n(20-50 keV) intensity of the binary system during quiescent\norbital phases is correlated with the pulse period, suggesting\na possible relation between the spin period behavior and the\nmass accretion rate.\nSeveral wind accretion models were proposed to explain\nboth the regular PP and apastron flaring activities of the\nsource. A dense disk around Wray 977, which intercepts the\nneutron star (NS) orbit near the periastron and the apastron,\nwas proposed by Pravdo et al. (1995) and Pravdo & Ghosh\n(2001). However, this model seems unable to provide a\nsatisfactory modeling of the observed orbital X-ray light\ncurve of the source (Leahy 2002) and optical observations by\nKaper et al. (2006) found no confirmation of the presence of\na disc. The existence of a high density stream of matter in\naddition to the stellar wind was proposed by Haberl (1991);\nLeahy (1991, 2002); Leahy & Kostka (2008). The stream outflows from Wray 977 due to tidal interaction intercepts the NS\norbit near the periastron and the apastron, causing a large increase in the mass accretion rate with a sudden enhancement\nof the X-ray luminosity from the neutron star. Signatures of\nthe presence of such a stream were found by Saraswat et al.\n(1996) analyzing the low-energy excess in the ASCA spectrum of GX 301-2, and also by Kaper et al. (2006) from the\norbital modulation of the spectral lines detected in the stellar\nwind of the optical companion. The wind-plus-stream model\npredicts also a large variation in the column density as a function of the orbital phase. The NH is expected to change from a\nvalue of \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 at orbital phase 0.8 to values greater than\n1024 cm\u22122 during the PP flares and between orbital phases\n0.2\u20130.3.\nWe observed the HMXB GX 301-2 with the SuperAGILE\n(SA) experiment onboard the Astro-rivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero (AGILE) satellite during the first year of the\nmission. AGILE, launched on 2007 April 23, is a scientific\nmission of the Italian Space Agency dedicated to high-energy\nastrophysics (Tavani et al. 2009). In the following sections we\nreport on the analysis of the SuperAGILE data, in the energy\nrange 20\u201360 keV. In Section 2 we describe the SuperAGILE\nexperiment and the observations of GX 301-2 we performed,\nin Section 3 we present the timing analysis of the pulsar emission and in Section 4 we analyze the orbital light curve of\nGX 301-2 using the hard X-ray SuperAGILE and the soft Xray RXTE/ASM data and the orbital variability of the source\npulsed fraction. Discussion of the data analysis and the interpretation of the results are presented in Section 5, while in\nSection 6 we draw our conclusions.\n2. SUPERAGILE OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n2.1. The SuperAGILE Experiment\n\nSuperAGILE (see Feroci et al. 2007 for an extensive description of the experiment) is the hard X-ray monitor of the\nAGILE mission and is based on four one-dimensional codedmask instruments, each one equipped with a \u223c 360 cm2 silicon microstrip detector and a tungsten mask-collimator system. The experiment has \u223c1 sr field of view (FoV), 6 arcmin\nangular resolution, and a point source location accuracy better than 2 arcmin for intense sources. SuperAGILE is able\nto detect X-ray photons between 18 keV and 60 keV with a\nresolution of \u223c8 keV FWHM and an on-axis effective area of\n250 cm2 . The time resolution of the instrument is 2 \u03bcs while\n\nthe accuracy is about 5 \u03bcs. The dead time is negligible in normal operation conditions, except for the passages through the\nSouth Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly where the vetoes from\nthe AGILE anticoincidence systems reduce the SA live time\nto \u223c10% or less. In the standard analysis this fraction of the\norbit is usually removed from the data.\nIn standard operation mode SuperAGILE provides event by\nevent data, from which position and normalized count rates\nfor each source detected in the FoV are derived. The data are\ndownloaded from the spacecraft about every 100 minutes during the AGILE passage over the Malindi ground station, sent\nto the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) in Rome and then\nprocessed by the SuperAGILE Scientific Pipeline (SASOA)\ndeveloped by the SuperAGILE team at INAF/IASF Rome\n(Lazzarotto et al. 2008) and running both at the ASDC and\nat IASF. The automated analysis of the SuperAGILE data autonomously updates a source catalog and orbital light curves\nfor bright sources are then posted at the ASDC web site21 .\n2.2. SuperAGILE Observations of GX 301-2\n\nSuperAGILE observations of the HMXB GX 301-2 started\nin mid 2007 July, just after the end of the AGILE Commissioning Phase, as part of the Science Verification Phase. Indeed,\nGX 301-2 was the first light of the experiment. Due to the solar constraints and the AGILE pointing strategy22 the satellite\nis operated by performing long observations, typically of 2\u2013\n4 weeks duration, during which the pointing direction slowly\ndrifts (at a rate of \u223c1\u25e6 day\u22121 ). SuperAGILE performed six\nlong observations of GX 301-2, for a total net exposure time\nof about 3.7 \u00d7 106 s. Table 1 shows the journal of the observations. The first observation and part of the second one were\nperformed during the AGILE Science Verification Phase that\nstarted in mid 2007 July and ended on 2007 November 30.\nThe other observations were carried out during the AGILE\nAO1 program, which started on 2007 December 1 and lasted\none year. The last column in Table 1 shows the source offaxis angle in the SuperAGILE FoV for each observation. The\nconfiguration of SuperAGILE implies that the source counts\ncollected by the instrument strongly depend on the off-axis\nangle (see e.g. Feroci et al. 2007), and thus also the detection\nsignificance is dependent on the source position in the FoV.\nThe SuperAGILE observations took place in different segments of the GX 301-2 binary orbit. In Figure 1 we graphically show the orbital phases of our six observations: three\nof them covered a large fraction of a complete binary orbit\n(Observations ID II, III and V), while the other three were\nshorter, and covered the equivalent of one full binary orbit all\ntogether, but arranged over three different orbits. The SuperAGILE data thus allow for a often continuous monitoring of\nthe complete 41.5 days binary cycle. It is worth noting that\nthe monitoring of four different passages at the pre-periastron\norbital phase (0.95) was included in the SuperAGILE observations.\n2.3. Data Reduction and Analysis\n\nSuperAGILE data reduction was performed using the standard SASOA pipeline (Lazzarotto et al. 2008), which extracts\nhigh level products from the photon-by-photon SuperAGILE data. Production of source images was performed with\nthe SuperAGILE Enhanced Multi Imaging (EMI) procedure\n21\n22\n\nhttp://agile.asdc.asi.it/sagilecat sources.html\nhttp://agile.asdc.asi.it/current pointing.html\n\n\fTemporal properties of GX 301-2\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- Graphical representations of the GX 301-2 binary system.

For each AGILE orbit the source\ncount rate was automatically extracted in the energy range 20\u2013\n60 keV, excluding the time spent by the satellite in crossing\nthe South Atlantic Geomagnetic Anomaly and the time when\nthe Earth occulted the line of sight to the source. Normalized\ncount rates (in units of counts cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) were then obtained by\nconsidering the effective area of the exposed portion of the detectors and assuming a Crab-like spectrum (e.g. Frontera et al.\n2007). Fluxes in unit of the Crab flux were calculated by applying a normalization factor of 0.15 to the normalized count\nrates. Uncertainties on the flux measurements were estimated\nby adding to the statistical error a systematic error equal to\nthe 8% of the measured flux (Feroci et al. 2009). In order to\navoid the introduction of biases in the light curve we did not\nselect the source detections for significance but all the observations were used in the analysis. A detailed description of\nthe method used for the generation of the SuperAGILE light\ncurves can be found in Feroci et al. (2009). The resulting 20\u2013\n60 keV light curve of GX 301-2 with a \u223c 6 \u00d7 103 s binning is\nshown in Figure 2.\nSuperAGILE events are time-tagged with microsecond precision by the AGILE on-board Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) system, which is synchronized to UTC once a second by the\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS). In order to perform timing\nanalysis all the SuperAGILE events are converted on ground\nto the Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) reference system.\nThe photon arrival time (TOA) is then converted to Barycenter\nDynamical Time and the correction for the arrival delay at the\nSolar System Barycenter is calculated by using the JPL planetary ephemeris DE405. A more detailed description of the\ncorrection algorithm may be found in Pellizzoni et al. (2009).\nCorrection for the time delay introduced by the binary orbital\nmotion was performed using the Blandford-Teukolsky model\n(Blandford & Teukolsky 1976; Taylor & Weisberg 1989). To\nperform the TOA correction we used the orbital parameters\nprovided by Koh et al. (1997), except for the orbital period\n(Porb ) and the time of periastron passage (T 0 ), for which\nwe utilized the updated values derived by Doroshenko et al.\n(2008). These parameters are given in Table 2. The quoted\nuncertainties are given at 1 \u03c3 level throughout the paper, unless otherwise specified.\n3. ANALYSIS OF THE SPIN PERIOD\n3.1. Pulse-shape Profile\n\nA search for the pulsed emission from the NS was performed on the corrected events of all the SuperAGILE source\nobservations using the standard epoch folding technique\n\n\f4\n\nEvangelista et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Light curve of GX 301-2 as observed by SuperAGILE.

(1997) and by\nDoroshenko et al. (2008). The uncertainties are at the 3\u03c3 level both for the\nKoh and the Doroshenko parameters.\n\n(Leahy et al. 1983). Due to the different off-axis angles to\nwhich the source was observed in the different pointings (see\nTable 1), corresponding to significantly different exposed effective areas, for each orbital phase bin we selected the available data with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, in order to\nobtain the best determination of the pulse shape. In case of\npulse shape variability between different orbital cycles, this\nchoice biases the pulse shape to the specific selection. However, we verified that in the other SuperAGILE observations\nof the same orbital phase bin the pulse shape was consistent, within the statistical uncertainties. Following this approach, pulse shape profiles for orbital phases between 0.26\nand 0.64 and between 0.81 and 0.06 were obtained from data\ncollected during Observation I and II, while the other pulse\nshape profiles were built using data taken during Observation\nIII. The width of the phase intervals was chosen according to\nthe signal-to-noise ratio in the profiles. This implies to have\na phase bin equal to \u223c0.10 (\u223c4 days) for the orbital phase\ninterval 0.06\u20130.34, where the source flux is lower, while a\nphase bin size .0.05 was used for the other orbital phases\nwith higher signal-to-noise. We were not able to detect NS\npulsation in orbital intervals 0.16\u20130.26, 0.34\u20130.38, 0.43\u20130.49,\n0.54\u20130.59 and 0.64\u20130.71.\nDue to the erratic behavior of the spin period of the windfed pulsar even on short timescales, as reported by Nagase\n(1989), Bildsten et al. (1997), Pravdo & Ghosh (2001), and\ntaking into account the errors on period determination, we\nwere not able to determine the absolute phasing of the pulse\nshape profile. Hence, we cross-correlated each pulse profile with a template obtained in the orbital phase 0.96\u20130.01\n\n(lower-right panel in Figure 3), which represents the pulse\nshape with the highest signal-to-noise. The resulting phase\nshifts were then used to build the background subtracted\nphase-aligned folded light curves shown in Figure 3. Despite the different statistical quality of the curves, a variability\nalong the orbital cycle can be clearly identified. The main\npeaks change in duration, shape and height. The main peak,\nat spin phase 0.0, shows a significant double peak structure\nonly at orbital phases between 0.96 and 0.06, where the most\ndramatic flux evolution of the source occurs. Although these\nare the orbital phases where the statistical quality is higher,\nthe insurgence of the minor peak does not appear as an observational bias: the evolution is gradual and continuous in the\nthree panels between phases 0.91 and 0.06, all with comparable quality.\nAnother variability feature that is worth remarking is the\nbehavior of the interpulse regions. At spin phase around 0.7 a\nsmall peak appears at orbital phase 0.88-0.91. Its onset seems\nalready anticipated in the previous orbital phase intervals. The\nother interpulse region, around spin phase 0.3, shows instead\nan intensity variability. The source flux in this interval is significantly higher, with respect to the peaks, in the spin phase\ninterval between 0.96 and 0.06, the same where the small peak\nmentioned above appears.\n3.2. Secular Evolution of the Spin Period\n\nThe SuperAGILE long-term and nearly continuous monitoring of GX 301-2 allowed us to measure the spin period\nat different epochs and put it in the context of the secular timing evolution of the source, as available from the literature. Figure 4(a) shows the spin period P as a function of the time from the discovery of the pulsed emission by White et al. (1976) to the last SuperAGILE observation (MJD 54709.5). This plot confirms that GX 301-2\nis subject to unpredictable torque variations superimposed\non long-term smooth variations of the spin period. During the last \u223c30 years the spin period changed passing from\na spin-up state, during which P decreased from \u223c700.5 s\nto \u223c675.4 s, to a spin-down condition reaching the current\nvalue of P \u223c687.3 s. The Figure clearly shows the two\nrapid spin-up episodes identified by Koh et al. (1997) analyzing CGRO/BATSE observations between MJD 48440 and\n\n\fTemporal properties of GX 301-2\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- GX 301-2 pulse shape profiles.

Comparing BATSE23 , RXTE/PCA (Kreykenbohm et al. 2004), INTEGRAL (Doroshenko et al. 2008) and SuperAGILE data in\nFigure 4(a) we find evidence of at least two other spin-up\nepisodes, occurred between the observations at MJD 51830\nand MJD 52789, and around MJD 54000.\nFigure 4(b) displays the secular variation of the GX 301-2\npulse period during the SuperAGILE observations. P varies\nin the range 685.3\u2013688.0 s in about 410 days. We find a period evolution consistent with the constant spin down rate of\n4.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 s s\u22121 . However, the short term variability of\nthe period clearly shows significant timing noise around the\ngeneral trend, and the linear fit (dashed line in Figure 4(b)) is\nindeed a poor modeling of the period evolution, leading to a\nreduced \u03c72 value of 2.9 (34 dof).\n23\n\nhttp://gammaray.msfc.nasa.gov/batse/pulsar\n\n4. ORBITAL VARIABILITY\n4.1. SuperAGILE and RXTE/ASM Folded Light Curves\nUsing all the SuperAGILE data collected during the observations listed in Table 1, we obtained the complete, folded\norbital light curve of GX 301-2 shown in the top panel of Figure 5. The orbital parameters (Porb , T 0 ) used in the folding\nprocedure were the same used for the correction for the time\ndelay discussed in Section 3. The difference in the orbital\nsolution found by Doroshenko et al. (2008) and by Koh et al.\n(1997) results in a 5% phase shift of the PP flare in the orbital folding, while the shape of the folded light curve does\nnot change noticeably. In order to obtain a folded light curve\nin the soft X-ray band we used public data from the All\nSky Monitor onboard RXTE (Levine et al. 1996). ASM data\nfor GX 301-2 cover the time span from MJD 50087.285 to\nMJD 54720.745 and consist of source count rates for each\n\n\f6\n\nEvangelista et al.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFig. 4.- (a) Secular variations of GX 301-2 pulse period.

The dwell-by-dwell data were filtered according to\nthe criteria reported on RXTE/ASM web site24 and then a light\ncurve was built from the cleaned data. The ASM folded light\ncurve for GX 301-2 is displayed in the second panel of Figure 5 (solid line).\nBoth the SuperAGILE and the ASM light curves are\ngiven in units of mCrab. We used the standard value of\n1 Crab = 75 counts s\u22121 as a conversion factor for the\nASM count rates, while the SuperAGILE normalization is\n0.15 counts cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The two folded orbital light curves\nclearly show the PP flaring activity, with an intensity peak\nobserved at orbital phase between \u223c0.9 and \u223c0.0 and a full\nwidth at half maximum of about 0.1 in phase. Fitting the PP\nflare by using a Gaussian function plus a constant term, we\nobtained a value of orbital phase of 0.954\u00b10.005 for the flare\nposition, with a FWHM value of 0.109.

Variability of the pulsed fraction\n\nThe variability in the shape of the pulse as a function of\nthe orbital phase shown in Figure 3 motivated us to study the\npulsed fraction across the binary orbital cycle, to determine its\npossible variability and correlation with other source parameters, such as flux and hardness. We operationally define the\npulsed fraction (Pfrac ) as the ratio between the pulsed counts,\nas derived directly from folding the event list, including photons from the background and from other sources in the FoV,\nand the total counts determined by the imaging procedure, including the counts from GX 301-2 only. We performed the\nanalysis of the pulsed fraction as a function of the pulsar or-\n\n\fTemporal properties of GX 301-2\n\n7\n\nTABLE 3\nMean Hardness Ratio of the PP Flares\n\nMJD Start\n\nMJD Stop\n\nPhase Start\n\nPhase Stop\n\nHR\n\n54315.84\n54481.77\n54523.25\n54647.70\n\n54319.37\n54485.30\n54526.78\n54652.22\n\n0.91\n0.91\n0.91\n0.91\n\n0.99\n0.99\n0.99\n0.99\n\n10.4 \u00b1 0.6\n17.5 \u00b1 1.2\n21.8 \u00b1 1.7\n14.0 \u00b1 0.9\n\nbital phase for all the available SuperAGILE observations during which the pulsation was detected. The results are shown\nin the bottom panel of Figure 5, where Pfrac is plotted as a\nfunction of the orbital phase.\nPfrac exhibits large variations across the binary cycle, passing from a minimum of Pfrac = 0.15 \u00b1 0.02 at orbital phase\n\u223c0.0 to a maximum of Pfrac = 0.64 \u00b1 0.12 at orbital phase\n\u223c0.5. With the aim of quantifying the significance of the variability of the pulsed fraction, we took the average of Pfrac in\nthe phase intervals where it appears consistent with a constant value, that is 0.05\u20130.39, 0.39\u20130.86 and 0.86\u20130.05. Thick\nred points in the bottom panel of Figure 5 represent the mean\nPfrac values calculated during the three selected orbital intervals. The values in the three phase intervals are 0.188\u00b10.009,\n0.387\u00b10.025 and 0.556\u00b10.034, ordered by phase. This analysis shows that it is possible to identify three different \"states\"\nin the pulsed fraction as a function of the NS orbital motion,\nwith the intermediate one occurring just after the PP flares\nand lasting approximately up to the phase corresponding to\nthe superior conjunction of the binary system.\nThe bottom panel in Figure 5 shows that the pulsed fraction reaches its minimum at the phase when the large flare\noccurs, that is where the largest variations in the pulse shape\nare detected. We then investigated the possible dependence\nof Pfrac on the source flux. The results are shown in Figure 6(a), where the value of the pulsed fraction against the\nsource flux is displayed, independently of the orbital or spin\nphase of the source. A clear anti-correlation between these\ntwo quantities is found, confirming it as a general feature\nand not only an event occurring during the PP periodic flare.\nThe plot shows that the pulsed fraction decreases rapidly at\nincreasing fluxes, reaching a plateau for large fluxes corresponding to a pulsed fraction of 15%, approximately a factor\n4 smaller than the maximum value. A similar behavior was\nalso recently reported by Lutovinov & Tsygankov (2009) using INTEGRAL/IBIS data.\n4.3. Hardness Ratio Versus Orbital Phase\nGiven the different orbital flux modulation at soft and hard\nX-rays (Figure 5), we investigated the period-averaged time\nbehavior of the source hardness along the orbital light curve.\nTo this aim we computed an hardness ratio (HR) by using the\nflux measurements by SuperAGILE and ASM, that is between\nthe energy ranges 20\u201360 keV and 2\u201312 keV. The third panel\nin Figure 5 shows the result. Filled circles indicate the orbital\nphase-resolved hardness ratio obtained by using the complete\ntemporal data set from both experiments. Moreover, star-like\nsymbols provide the same quantity, but computed after selecting the ASM time intervals coeval with the SuperAGILE data\nsets (the ASM light curve with this selection is shown using\nthe same symbols in the second panel of the same figure).\nThe time profile of the HR computed using both time selections indicates a clear modulation of the source spectral\nhardness as a function of the orbital phase, where we identify the following features. A spectral hardening is detected\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nFig. 6.- (a) Pfrac as a function of the source intensity. The clear anticorrelation between pulsed fraction and source flux is ascribed to the different\namount of matter which accumulates near and accretes onto the neutron star.\n(b) and (c) Hardness ratio as a function of the source flux in the 20\u201360 keV\n(b) and 2\u201312 keV (c) energy bands.\n\nduring the pre-periastron flare: the hard X-ray flux rises faster\nthan the soft X-rays, and lasts longer. Then, when the soft\nX-ray flux drops at its minimum orbital level, around phase\n0.2, the hard X-rays hold their intensity level, indicating an\nincreasing hardness of the emitted radiation. Subsequently,\nthe rise of the soft X-ray flux after phase 0.5 (the apastron)\nis not accompanied by a corresponding increase at hard Xrays, indicating a softer emission in this part of the orbit. We\n\n\f8\n\nEvangelista et al.\n\nnote that using the simultaneous data only (stars in the HR\nplot), the above features are confirmed and, within the limits of the lower statistical quality, emphasized. Actually, the\nsource spectral hardness changes also from one binary orbit\nto another. In Table 3 we provide the HR values computed in\nthe orbital phases including the PP flare in the four available\nSuperAGILE observations. The value of the HR changes up\nto a factor of 2.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nThe pointing strategy of the AGILE mission offered SuperAGILE the opportunity of studying the temporal properties of GX 301-2 in the hard X-rays over repeated \u223cmonthlong stretches of time, covering six 41.5 days binary orbits\nat different phases. We observed a modulation of the hard\nX-ray flux along the orbit in general agreement with what\nreported over the past two decades by previous experiments\nin soft and hard X-rays. Fitting the source spectrum in the\n20\u201360 keV energy band with a cut-off power-law with photon index fixed to \u0393=1.05 (La Barbera et al. 2005), we obtain\n+0.7\nEcut =24.4+1.2\n\u22121.4 keV and E fold =7.8\u22120.7 keV for the PP flare occurred around MJD 54316. Using these parameters, and assuming a source distance of 3 kpc (Kaper et al. 2006), we convert the SuperAGILE counts to physical units obtaining a luminosity of \u223c2.3\u00d71037 erg s\u22121 . Under the same assumptions,\nthe luminosity during the quiescent orbital phases is approximately one order of magnitude smaller.\nThe only complete folded orbital light curve of GX 3012 at energies above 20 keV available in the literature, to\nwhich we can compare the SuperAGILE results, was built\nfrom the data of the BATSE experiment, using the Earth\noccultation technique (Pravdo et al. 1995; Pravdo & Ghosh\n2001) or the pulsed flux measurements (Koh et al. 1997).\nThe SuperAGILE data show significant differences. In contrast to the BATSE observations in the same energy range\n(Pravdo & Ghosh 2001), the SuperAGILE data do not show\nany secondary peak in the folded light curve near the passage\nat the apastron (orbital phase \u223c0.5). This second peak was indeed weakly detected in the BATSE measurements of the total\nsource flux (Pravdo & Ghosh 2001), while it was outstanding in the pulsed flux only (Koh et al. 1997). The different\nshape of the orbital light curve of the total flux as measured\nby BATSE and SuperAGILE may be ascribed to intrinsic time\nvariability between the different orbits and/or epochs of the\nobservations (1991\u20131997 for BATSE and 2007\u20132008 for SuperAGILE) and/or to the different effective bandpasses of the\ntwo experiments (harder for BATSE than for SuperAGILE despite their similar nominal energy range). Actually, hints toward time variability near the apastron phase were already\nprovided by the epoch-resolved BATSE folded light curves\nreported by Pravdo & Ghosh (2001), where only two out of\nfour curves show a broad hump around phase 0.5, although\nthe statistical quality of the data does not allow for a definite\nstatement. Also the recent Swift/BAT data of three orbital cycles reported by Pestalozzi et al. (2009) show bumps around\nphase \u223c0.5 in two contiguous orbital cycles around 2008 December (unfortunately these time periods were not covered by\nSA observations).\nInstead, the pronounced bump around the apastron phase\nfound by Koh et al. (1997) in the pulsed flux appears consistent with our results, when the behavior of the pulsed fraction along the binary orbit is considered. As we show in Figure 5, we found a large orbital variation of the pulsed fraction:\nwithin the statistical accuracy of our data, the pulsed fraction\n\nexhibits a step-like behavior along the orbit. The minimum\nvalue is reached at the periastron, while a broad maximum,\nnearly 3 times as high, is reached at phases between 0.4 and\n0.9. This implies that the pulsed flux increases in the phase\nrange corresponding to the apastron, coherently with what\nwas found in the BATSE pulsed data.\nInterestingly, the same orbital phases where the pulsed fraction is highest are also those where the emitted radiation is\nsoftest. In fact, we analyzed the behavior of the source hardness along the orbit by using the SuperAGILE data in combination with the public RXTE/ASM data. We found that the\nradiation emitted by the source is harder near the periastron\nand at phases around 0.2\u20130.3, while it becomes significantly\nsofter at phases 0.5\u20130.8 (Figure 5). The hardening around\nphase 0.2\u20130.3 was also detected by Pravdo & Ghosh (2001)\nthrough an analysis similar to ours, using the BATSE and\nASM data, but they did not report evidence for the hardening near the periastron, that is instead the main feature in our\ndata. More in general, our data suggest an anti-correlation between the hardness and the pulsed fraction at hard X-rays (as\nwell as between the pulsed fraction and the flux, Figure 6(a)).\nThe general behavior of the source is summarized in the\nsynoptic panels of Figure 7, where the parameters are graphically displayed along the binary orbit. These plots show that\neven if the only significant feature in the flux modulation observed by SuperAGILE occurs at the pre-periastron phase,\nthe emission mechanism undergoes important changes also\nin other parts of the orbit. The passage at the periastron is\naccompanied with a hardening of the radiation and with a\nsudden and large decrease of the pulsed fraction, as already\nreported by La Barbera et al. (2005), using the BeppoSAX observations, and Lutovinov & Tsygankov (2009) using INTEGRAL data. The pulsed fraction shows (Figure 6(a)) a clear\nanti-correlation with the source flux, thus presumably with\nthe accretion rate. Instead, the hardness ratio does not show\na clear dependence on the X-ray flux (and then the accretion\nrate), suggesting a more complex relation. It is interesting\nto note that the largest drop in the pulsed fraction is approximately a factor of 3, from \u223c0.55 to \u223c0.2, while the flux increase in the same phase interval is about a factor of 10. This\nimplies that the excess hard radiation emitted during the preperiastron flare does not represent a proportional luminosity\nincrease of the same regions emitting in the preceding orbital\nphases, that would leave the pulsed fraction unchanged, nor\nan unrelated emission from a site not subject to occultation by\nthe NS upon spinning, that would cause a larger drop in the\npulsed fraction. Thus, either the site of the excess emission is\nonly partially occulted to the line of sight as the NS rotates,\nor it is associated with an intervening radiative transfer mechanism able to smear the coherence of the photon arrival times\n(as proposed by Makino et al. 1985). Moving from the periastron to the apastron, the pulsed fraction seems to recover\ngradually to its maximum value. Instead, the hardness ratio\nshows a further, smaller peak at phases near 0.25 mostly due\nto a depression in the soft X-ray flux. Thus the cause intervening in obscuring or depressing the emission of soft X-rays\nwhere the NS approaches the apastron phase, leaves the persistent hard X-ray component unaffected, as witnessed by the\nunchanging flux level measured by SuperAGILE.\nLeahy (2002) (see also Leahy & Kostka 2008) quite convincingly modeled the orbital modulation of the soft X-ray\nemission in the GX 301-2 system as driven by wind accretion plus a mass stream, drawing an Archimedes spiral path\n\n\fTemporal properties of GX 301-2\n\n(a)\n\n9\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nFig. 7.- Summary of the orbital behavior of GX 301-2: hard X-ray flux (a), pulsed fraction (b) and hardness ratio (c). Units along the axis are in solar radii.\n\nand periodically intercepting the neutron star. The effect of\nthe spiral stream accretion on the orbital light curve is the\npre-periastron flare and the broad bump around the apastron\nphase, both caused by the sudden and large increase in the accretion rate. The larger density and narrower geometrical size\nof the intercepted accretion stream near the periastron phase\ncauses a flare shorter and more intense than at the apastron\nphase. In this scenario, the same matter that accretes is also\nresponsible for a very large absorption column (thus the hardening) and for scattering of the radiation from the neutron star,\nbringing loss of timing coherence (decrease in the pulsed fraction). This is indeed what the ASM data show at soft X-rays.\nIn the same model, the wind component determines a smooth\nvariation of the flux, peaking only at the pre-periastron phase.\nThis is what the SuperAGILE data show at hard X-rays.\nLeahy & Kostka (2008) show that around phase 0.25 the\nsoft X-rays are largely absorbed by a partial occultation of the\nneutron star by the atmosphere of the companion star. This is\nconsistent with both the ASM flux modulation and with the\nSuperAGILE/ASM hardness ratio. However, we observe an\n\neven more intense hardening peak of the emitted radiation at\nthe pre-periastron that is not shown in the model prediction by\nLeahy & Kostka (2008). In this case the hardness peak is not\ndue to a decrease in the soft X-ray flux, but to a larger increase\nin the hard X-rays than in soft X-rays, still in the presence of\na strong flare in both energy bands. If absorption is responsible for such an effect, this implies that the site of the large\nflare lies behind the absorbing material (thus the unabsorbed\nsoft X-ray flux would be far larger) and both the flare and absorption occur at the same orbital phase, suggesting that the\ntwo are related in origin. Large increases (factor of \u223c10) in\nthe absorption column near the periastron phase were indeed\nreported by early studies (Haberl 1991 using EXOSAT data,\nLeahy 1991 using TENMA data) while more recent studies,\nusing a partial covering absorber model, reported smaller variations (factor of \u223c2 with BeppoSAX, La Barbera et al. 2005)\nand rather scattered in orbital phase (Mukherjee & Paul 2004,\nwith RXTE/PCA).\nAs already mentioned, at this phase we detect a large decrease in the pulsed fraction, implying that the hard X-rays\n\n\f10\n\nEvangelista et al.\n\nhere are more loosely affected by the NS spinning than the soft\nX-rays. This may suggest that (at least) the hard X-ray emission at the pre-periastron peak may be associated with temporary conditions setting up when the NS crosses the accretion\nstream at its minimum distance from the companion star. It\nis also interesting to remind that just at this orbital phase, a\ndetection of non-thermal radio emission from GX 301-2 has\nbeen very recently reported by Pestalozzi et al. (2009).\nChanges of the properties or sites of the hard X-ray emission along the orbit are suggested also by our study of the\nneutron star pulse profile as a function of the orbital phase.\nSimilar to what found by La Barbera et al. (2005) using the\nBeppoSAX data, we detected a large variability in the pulse\nshape of the pulsar in the hard X-ray range. The main points\nof variability we detected are: the structure of the main peak,\nthe intensity at the interpulse and the amplitude of the pulsation (i.e., the pulsed fraction discussed above). As found\nby BeppoSAX, in the SuperAGILE data the pulse appears\nsmoothest at orbital phases near the pre-periastron. The shape\nwe obtained for the orbital phase interval 0.91\u20130.96 is reminiscent of the BeppoSAX/PDS curve. However, in approaching and leaving the phase of the large flare, the pulse shape\nshows transient features. A small peak structure (at spin phase\naround 0.1 in Figure 3) gradually appears on the rising and decaying phases of the flare (orbital phases from 0.91 to 0.06),\nbeing more prominent after the periastron. Simultaneously,\nthe flux level at the inter-pulse phase (around 0.25) becomes\nhigher. As the neutron star approaches the apastron and goes\nbeyond, the pulse shape at energies above 20 keV becomes\nincreasingly complex (although the smaller statistics does not\nallow us to identify individual substructures), with the main\npulses becoming alternately narrower and wider. Interestingly, approaching again the pre-periastron phase, a small\npeak appears in the interpulse region. This clearly shows up\nat orbital phase 0.88\u20130.91. All of these features, including the\nsmaller peak, are not in contrast with the BeppoSAX results,\nobtained by La Barbera et al. (2005) in their detailed analysis\nof the pulse shape in four short orbital phase intervals. Altogether these results seem to suggest that the emitting region\non the neutron star is significantly affected by the changing\naccretion pattern along the binary orbit.\nOne last consideration derives from the secular variation\nof the pulse period of the neutron star, collected in Figure 4.\nAs already commented and discussed by several authors (e.g.\nKoh et al. 1997), the spin history is complex and shows several changes in the spin-up and spin-down trends, sometimes\nalso very rapid. The major changes in the past were probably accompanied to important variations in the emission. In\nthe last \u223c15 years (from MJD 49500 onward), a general spindown trend is settled, perturbed only by few short and rapid\nspin-up episodes. In particular, despite some small-amplitude\ntiming noise that SuperAGILE detected (Figure 4(b)), in the\nlast \u223ctwo years the GX 301-2 system appears rather steadily\nevolving with a spin-down rate of about 1.3 s yr\u22121 , showing\nno rapid or large perturbations.\n6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe studied the long term behavior of the HMXB GX 301-2\nusing the hard X-ray data collected by SuperAGILE during\nthe first year of the AGILE mission. The observations, carried out in the 20\u201360 keV energy band, have a large net exposure, about 3.7 Ms, and cover all the orbital phases of the\nbinary system. The SuperAGILE data offer one of the most\ncomplete hard X-ray monitoring of the 41.5-day long binary\n\nperiod available to date. The data span covers large fractions\nof six orbital cycles. The secular trend of the \u223c680 s pulse\nperiod is consistent with the previous observations, although\nthe SuperAGILE data show a decrease in the spin-down rate\nwith respect to the observations reported by Doroshenko et al.\n(2008). The spin-down trend is approximately constant, but\nthere is indication of a significant timing noise, of the order of\n\u223c0.2%.\nComplementing the SuperAGILE data with those of\nRossiXTE/ASM, the source behavior was characterized at all\nthe phases of the binary orbit, in terms of its soft and hard Xray flux, spectral hardness, spin period history, pulsed fraction\nand pulse shape. Compared with the soft X-ray data, the hard\nX-ray lightcurve exhibits a smaller modulation of the emission during the orbital phases 0.1\u20130.8 and a larger intensity\nof the pre-periastron flare. This results in a spectral hardness\nwhich presents clear orbital modulation, with peaks in correspondence with the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25.\nThe timing analysis of the hard X-ray emission showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of the orbital phase, with\nsubstructures detected near the passage at the periastron, and\na clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in\nturn strongly anti-correlated with the source intensity.\nOverall, the scenario depicted by the SA data appears generally consistent with the model for this binary system proposed by Leahy & Kostka (2008). The predictions of the\nmodel are based on the variability in the accretion rate caused\nby the orbital motion of the NS in the environment of the matter outflow from the companion star. The model is suited to\nthe low energy observations by RXTE/ASM, for which it reproduces the peaked flare at the pre-periastron and the broader\npeak at the apastron. They both are related to the NS crossing\nof the accretion stream, the difference between the two being\nmostly in the local density and geometrical size of the stream\nat the crossing point. The higher accretion rate causes a soft\nX-ray brightening, and scattering of the radiation by the same\nmatter would cause loss of coherence and then a decrease in\nthe pulsed fraction. In the hard X-rays we do not detect the\nbroad peak at the apastron phase (although other hard X-ray\nobservations with BATSE and Swift/BAT suggest time variability for it). Also, our observation of the folded hardness\nratio (20\u201350 keV to 2\u201312 keV) along the orbit is not fully consistent with the model expectations. Indeed the model predicts\nan increase in the column density near the apastron phase, but\nit does not predict a similar increase near the pre-periastron,\nthat we instead clearly detect.\nMore in general, our results fit in the overall scenario of\nthe binary X-ray pulsars (e.g. Parmar et al. 1989), where the\ntiming properties are related to the source luminosity. As a\nmatter of fact, our analysis shows that the pulsed fraction is\nclearly anti-correlated with the source intensity, allowing us\nto attribute the accretion rate the role of driving parameter\nin the system. However, while the timing properties appear\nrather well correlated with the source intensity, the same is\nnot true for the hardness ratio, for which we cannot identify\na trend with the flux. This implies that the emitting process\nand/or geometry change along the orbit in a way that is not\nimmediately associated to the variation of the accretion rate\nonly.\nWe thank L. Stella, P.
