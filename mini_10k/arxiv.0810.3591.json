This allows us to address important questions concerning\nthe solar cycle and its effect on solar oscillations, such as: how consistent is\nthe acoustic behaviour from one cycle to the next? We have used the p-mode\nfrequencies observed in BiSON data from one solar activity cycle (cycle 22) to\npredict the mode frequencies that were observed in the next activity cycle (cycle\n23).

Methods have been developed to remove\nsolar cycle frequency shifts (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2004) to allow comparisons between the mode frequencies obtained from non-contemporaneous data and to\nenable accurate activity-independent structural inversions to be performed.\nThe Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) has been recording\ndata for over 30 yrs, and so observations span nearly three solar cycles. We\naim to take advantage of this to answer the following question: can the mode\nfrequencies observed in cycle 22 be used to predict the mode frequencies observed\nin cycle 23? In other words, is it possible to produce a model that can be used\nto predict the mode frequencies observed in cycle 23?\nEach 11 yr solar cycle is different from the previous one, for example, cycle 23 has been described as magnetically simpler than recent previous cycles\n(de Toma et al. 2004). Several different activity proxies can be used to measure the level of solar activity and, as each proxy responds to different physical\nprocesses, the amplitude and shape of each activity cycle depends upon which\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA.-M.

The\nobserved at different activity levels when four different\nactivity proxies were used to predict the frequency shifts.\n\nactivity proxy is considered. With this in mind we aim to determine whether\nthe acoustic behaviour of the Sun is predictable from one cycle to the next.\nWe begin this paper by describing how we used the mode frequencies, observed in cycle 22, to predict the mode frequencies observed in cycle 23 (Section\n2). Then, in Section 3, we compare these predicted frequencies with the actual\nfrequencies observed in cycle 23. Section 4 comprises a discussion of the results.\n\n2.\n\nPredicting frequency shifts\n\nAn 11 yr BiSON time series is available, which covers the whole of cycle 22.\nTo allow solar cycle frequency shifts to be examined this data set was split\ninto contiguous 108 d time series. A standard likelihood maximization method\nwas used to fit the power spectra of these time series (e.g. Chaplin et al. 1999),\nenabling the observed mode frequencies to be determined. The weighted mean\nactivity level, a, observed during each 108 d time period was also calculated for\nfour activity proxies, namely the 10.7 cm flux (F10.7 ), the HeI equivalent width\n(HeI EW), the Kitt Peak Magnetic Index (KPMI) and the International Sunspot\nNumber (ISN).\nA minimum activity reference set was determined by averaging the frequencies from five 108 d time series that were observed during the minimum activity\nepoch at the boundary between cycle 22 and cycle 23. We define the solar cycle\nfrequency shifts as the difference between the frequencies given in the minimum\nactivity reference set and the frequencies of the corresponding modes observed\nat different epochs and, consequently, different levels of activity. The size of\na frequency shift has a well-known dependency on frequency and mode inertia\nand these dependencies were removed in the manner described in Chaplin et al.\n(2004). We have, therefore, determined the mean frequency shift at a given\nactivity level. We now describe how these shifts were used to predict the mode\nfrequencies observed in cycle 23.\n\n\fAcoustic behaviour of p modes\nTable 1.\n\n3\n\nThe weighted mean \u03c72a for the different activity proxies\n\nProxy\nF10.7\nHeI EW\nKPMI\nISN\n\nWeighted mean \u03c72a\n1.18 \u00b1 0.06\n1.20 \u00b1 0.06\n1.30 \u00b1 0.06\n1.18 \u00b1 0.06\n\nDistance from \u03c72 = 1\n3.1\u03c3\n3.5\u03c3\n5.2\u03c3\n3.1\u03c3\n\nFor low-degree p modes, the relationship between activity and mean frequency shift is approximately linear. A linear least squares fit was performed to\ndetermine the coefficients of the relationship between the mean frequency shifts\nobserved during cycle 22 and the corresponding mean activity observed by each\nof the four activity proxies. These linear relationships were then used to predict\nthe size of the mean frequency shift at a given activity level, which corresponds\nto a particular time period from cycle 23.\nLet \u03b4\u03bd1 (a) be the mean frequency shift predicted by the linear relationship\nfor a given activity level, a. To determine the frequency shift for a particular\nmode, \u03b4\u03bdn,l (a), with degree, l, and radial order, n, it was necessary to scale\n\u03b4\u03bd1 (a) with mode frequency and inertia. This was done using equation 4 of\nChaplin et al. (2004). The resulting frequency shift, \u03b4\u03bdn,l (a), was added to the\ncorresponding mode frequency stored in the minimum activity reference set to\ngive a predicted frequency, and its associated errors, for a given epoch. The\npredicted frequencies were compared to the frequencies observed in BiSON data\nduring the same time span and we now go on to describe the results of this\ncomparison.\n3.\n\nAnalysis of results\n\nTo determine how accurate the prediction method is we have compared the predicted frequency of a mode at an activity level, a, with the frequency observed\nin BiSON data at the same activity level. The observed frequencies were determined by fitting the power spectrum of the corresponding 108 d time series\nusing the standard likelihood maximization method (Chaplin et al. 1999).\nThe reduced \u03c72 between the predicted and the observed frequencies at a\nparticular activity level was determined. Let \u03c72a be the reduced \u03c72 for all modes\nfor which accurate fits to the data were obtained in a 108 d time\np series, observed\nduring cycle 23. Errors on the reduced \u03c72 were taken to be 2/(N \u2212 1), where\nN is the number of data points used to calculate the reduced \u03c72 . Figure 1 shows\nthe variation of \u03c72a with activity, where each panel shows the results predicted\nby a different activity proxy. The vast majority of the observed \u03c72a are within\n3\u03c3 of unity, which is the expected value if the model is accurate. However, for\nall activity proxies, the observed \u03c72a are predominately greater than unity, which\nimplies there is some bias in the predicted results.\nTo determine whether there is any correlation between the level of activity\nand the accuracy of the predicted frequencies the Pearson's correlation coefficient\nbetween activity level and \u03c72a was calculated (see the values above the panels in\nFigure 1). None of the correlation coefficients are significant at a 95% confidence\n\n\f4\n\nA.-M.

However, the correlation coefficient for the 10.7 cm flux result is smaller\nthan for the other activity proxies. The results imply that the accuracy of\nthe predictions made using the HeI EW, the ISN and the KPMI are marginally\ndependent on activity. We propose that this is true for the following reason. The\nHeI EW is mainly sensitive to the weak magnetic field and the ISN and KPMI\nare most sensitive to the strong magnetic field, while the 10.7 cm flux shows\ngood sensitivity to both the strong and the weak magnetic flux. Therefore, we\nbelieve that to make accurate predictions at all activity levels it is necessary for\nthe activity proxy to be responsive to both the strong and weak flux.\nAs a measure of the overall accuracy of the predictions the weighted mean\n\u03c72a was determined, and the results are shown in Table 1. All of the weighted\nmean \u03c72a are more than 3\u03c3 from unity, indicating there is some bias in the\npredicted frequencies. The weighted mean \u03c72a is noticeably larger for the KPMI\nthan when the other proxies are used, which highlights the inadequacies of this\nproxy as a predictive tool.\nWe also investigated whether the accuracy of the predicted mode frequencies\nwas dependent on frequency (or n). Let \u03c72n,l be the reduced \u03c72 for individual\nn and l across all activity levels. The results are shown in Figure 2.

However, it should be noted that this is only\ntrue for the range of n examined here. Once we move outside this frequency\nrange (2200 \u03bcHz \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 3500 \u03bcHz) the quality of both the fitted frequencies and\nthe predictions deteriorates significantly.\n3.1.\n\nTime series of different lengths\n\nNext, we sought to determine whether the data observed in 108 d time series\nin cycle 22 could be used to predict the acoustic behaviour observed in longer\n(216 d, 432 d) data sets from cycle 23. Figure 3 shows the variation of \u03c72a with\nactivity when predictions were made for different length time series. The determined \u03c72a increases with the length of the time series, implying that the predictions for longer time series are less accurate. Additionally, the weighted mean\n\u03c72a , which are quoted in Table 2 (when the 108 d time series are used to make\nthe predictions), are found to be larger for the longer time series, indicating the\n108 d time series can not be used to predict the frequencies observed in longer\ntime series.\nFigure 4 shows the variation of \u03c72l,n with radial order, n, for different length\ntime series. The determined \u03c72l,n increase as n decreases, especially in the longer\ntime series, indicating that the predictions for low-n modes are less accurate\nin long time series. Quoted above each panel in Figure 4 are the Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficients, which become increasingly negative for the long time\nseries and is in fact significant at a 95% confidence level for the 432 d time series.\nThis is probably because it is more difficult to observe low-frequency modes in\n108 d time series than in longer data sets and so the predicted frequencies are\nbiased.\nFinally we ask whether more accurate predictions are made if the frequencies observed in longer time series are used to define the relationship between\nfrequency shift and activity. For example, we have used the mode frequencies\nobserved in time series of length 216 d during cycle 22 to make predictions of\nthe mode frequencies observed in 216 d time series in cycle 23.

The accuracy of the predictions made using the\n10.7 cm flux show least dependence on activity, probably because the 10.7 cm\nflux is sensitive to both the strong and the weak magnetic field. The predictions\nmade using the KPMI were not as accurate as those made using the other models\nand so this proxy should not be used as a predictive tool.\nThe accuracy of the predictions decreases when 108 d time series are used\nto predict mode frequencies for longer time series and so 108 d time series can\nnot be used to predict the acoustic behaviour observed in longer time series.\nThe predicted frequencies were more accurate when longer data sets were used\nto make the predictions and when the time series from cycle 22, which were used\nto make the predictions, and the cycle 23 time series were of the same length.\nNote that this analysis has been performed using the mode frequencies observed\nin 2 solar cycles only but would ideally use the data from more solar cycles.\nAcknowledgments.
