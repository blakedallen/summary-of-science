Here we introduce the\nmethods and use the LMC as a test case. The distribution\nof young stars in the LMC was first studied with objective\nalgorithms by Feitzinger & Braunsfurth (1984), who found\nthat the distribution was not random but had distinct patterns on all of the spatial scales probed (60 pc to 8 kpc).\nOther studies have come to similar conclusions, that young\nstars are distributed hierarchically within galaxies (e.g. Efremov 1984, Battinelli, Efremov, & Magnier 1996, Elmegreen\n& Salzer 1999, Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2003, Elmegreen et\nal. 2006, Bastian et al. 2005, 2007, S\u00e1nchez et al. 2007). This\npattern observed in the young stellar distribution is thought\nto originate from the distribution and fragmentation of gas\nwithin galaxies (e.g. Elmegreen & Efremov 1996; Elmegreen\n& Falgarone 1996).\nIt has been noted that many nearby star forming clusc 2008 RAS\n\nters also have hierarchical structure seemingly dictated by\nthe structure of the dense gas of natal molecular clouds (e.g.\nLada & Lada 2003). Using statistical techniques, Gutermuth\net al. (2005) studied three Galactic clusters of varying degrees of embeddedness and demonstrated that the least embedded cluster was also the least dense and the least substructured of the three. That result hinted at the idea that\nthe youngest clusters are substructured, but that dynamical\ninteractions and ejection of the structured gas contributes\nto the evolution and eventual erasure of that substructure\nin approximately the cluster formation timescale of a few\nMyr (Palla & Stahler 2000). By having an accurate model\nof the spatial evolution of stellar structures we can approach\na number of fundamental questions about star-formation, including what is the percentage of stars born in \"clusters\" and\nwhether this depends on environmental conditions. Using\nautomated algorithms on infrared Spitzer surveys of starforming sites within the Galaxy (e.g. Allen et al. 2007), such\nconstraints are now becoming possible.\n\n\f2\n\nBastian et al.\n\nIn addition to constraining models of star-formation on\ngalaxy and cluster scales, the spatial distribution of stars can\nhave important implications on a variety of other astrophysical problems. For example, the mixture of gas and stars can\naffect the temperature structure within Hii regions which in\nturn can influence metallicity determinations based on emission line spectra (Ercolano, Bastian, Stasinska 2007). Thus,\na small dependence on clustering properties of young stars\non galactocentric distance (i.e. if there is a slight preference\nto form more concentrated stellar groups in the central parts\nof galaxies compared to the outer regions as may be expected\nif gas pressure plays a dominant role in cluster formation)\ncould artificially enhance the metallicity gradient observed\nin spiral galaxies.\nPrevious works on stellar structures have mainly concentrated on the youngest stellar objects (OB stars), while\nthe evolution of these objects have remained largely unstudied. Efremov (1995) studied the distribution of Cepheids,\nwhose ages are significantly higher than OB stars, and\nfound evidence of huge stellar complexes which he suggested\nmay be made up of dissolved aged associations. Zaritsky\net al. (2004) showed the stark contrast between the spatial distribution of young and old stellar populations in the\nLMC using two colour-magnitude cuts through the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey (MCPS).\nThe goal of this paper is to quantify the timescale over\nwhich stellar structures within the LMC evolve. To this end,\nwe use two methods to estimate the evolution and analyse each method's strengths and weaknesses. Our primary\ndataset comes from the MCPS where we make cuts in colour\nand magnitude space in order to select differing stellar populations (quantifying the age through comparison with stellar isochrones with a given initial mass function) which we\ncompliment with catalogues of stellar clusters (Hunter et\nal. 2003) and embedded young stellar objects (Whitney et\nal. 2008).\nThe paper is organised in the following way. In \u00a7 2 we\nintroduce the observations and the methods used, while in\n\u00a7 3 we compare the properties (size and luminosity distributions) of the young star-forming groups between the LMC\nand M33. In \u00a7 4 we extract twelve samples of stars of varying\nmean ages in order to compare their clustering properties,\nwhich is carried out in \u00a7 5. In \u00a7 6 we discuss the implications\nof our results and present a series of simple models to aid in\nthe interpretation, and in \u00a7 7 we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND METHOD\n\nOur primary set of data comes from the Magellanic Cloud\nPhotometry Survey of Zaritsky et al. (2004). This dataset\nconsists of U, B, V, and I band imaging of essentially the\nentire optical extent of Large Magellanic Cloud. The original\nlist consists of over 24 million sources, far too many for our\nalgorithm, so we restrict our study to various cuts in colour\nand magnitude space.\nThe method that we employ to first study the distribution of star-forming sites is the same as was presented in\nBastian et al. (2007) for the study of the spatial distribution of OB stars in M33. We refer the reader to that work\nfor details and only provide a summary of the method here.\nUsing the photometry of individual stars we make colour\n\nand magnitude cuts in order to select young stars (see \u00a7 3\nfor details of the cuts). We then construct a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the spatial positions of stars which pass\nour criteria1 . The tree is then fractured (FMST) by applying a breaking distance, Dbreak , in which all edges of the\ntree, longer than Dbreak , are broken (i.e. removed), creating\nindependent groups. In order to avoid a selection bias which\nhas hampered previous studies, we apply multiple breaking\ndistances (20 in all) from pc to kpc scales. Throughout this\npaper, unless otherwise noted, we have used a value of five\nfor Nmin , which is the minimum number of sources used to\ndefine a group.\nIn \u00a7 4 we extend our study by not only looking at the\nyoungest stars, but also the distribution of stars of various\nages.\nThroughout this study we have assumed a distance to\nthe LMC of 50 kpc (e.g. Marconi & Clementini 2005). For\ncomparison with models (both fractal and uniform distributions) we will assume that the LMC is largely 2D - i.e.\nthat it is a disk-like face on galaxy. This assumption will be\njustified in \u00a7 5.1.\n\n3\n\nSIZE AND LUMINOSITY DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nAs a first step towards understanding the spatial distribution of star-forming regions in the LMC we perform a similar study as was carried out on M33 (Bastian et al. 2007).\nWe have used cuts in colour and magnitude space (namely\nB \u2212V < 0.5 and MV < \u22124.5 - uncorrected for extinction) in\norder to select young (massive) stars, resulting in 5093 stars\nwhich pass these criteria. The sample is then analysed using\nthe Fractured Minimum Spanning Tree method, selecting\n20 breaking distances between the effective resolution limit\nof 1.5 pc and 1 kpc (with equal steps in logarithmic space\nof 0.1485). We refer the reader to Bastian et al. (2007) for\ndetails on the method. This method produces a catalogue of\ngroups and their properties, namely size and luminosity, for\neach breaking distance applied. We also combined these catalogues into a 'total sample' from which we removed groups\nfound by multiple breaking radii (i.e. duplicate groups that\nhad the exact same position and radius) only retaining the\ngroups found by the smallest breaking radius. We note that\nin the individual catalogues we did not remove duplicates\n(i.e. groups that were found by other Dbreak ), as each breaking distance was treated seperately.\n3.1\n\nSize distribution\n\nWe first look at the size distribution of the groups found.\nIn Bastian et al. (2007) we found that for M33 there was\nnot a characteristic size for star-forming regions, contrary\nto what is often quoted in the literature. We showed that\nprevious claims of a characteristic size of \u223c 100 pc for OBassociations (e.g. Bresolin et al. 1998) was due to the selection of a single breaking distance or scale in which to carry\nout the analysis.\n1\n\nAn MST is formed by connecting all points (spatial positions\nin this case) in order to form a unified network, such that the\ntotal length (i.e. sum) of all of the connections, known as 'edges'\nor 'branches', is minimized, and no closed loops are formed.\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fThe evolution of structure in the LMC\n\nFigure 1. The size (radius) distribution of the groups for three\ndifferent breaking radii as well as for the total sample. Each distribution is well fit by a log-normal distribution whose peak depends\non the scale probed. The dashed (red) lines show the best fitting\nlog-normal function to each distribution.\n\nWe carried out a similar analysis for the LMC, and come\nto similar conclusions. Figure 1 shows the cumulative size\ndistribution of groups found with various breaking distances\nand for the total sample. The dashed (red) lines show the\nbest fitting log-normal function to each distribution, which\nprovides a good fit for each breaking distance. The total\nsample displays an excess tail at large radii (> 400 pc) relative to the best fitting analytical fit, however it is well fit up\nuntil this point. This break is similar, although at slightly\nsmaller scales (400 pc vs. 1 kpc) to that seen in the autocorrelation function of young stars in the LMC (Odekon 2008,\nher Fig. 3). It is also similar to the scale where a break in\nthe HI distribution is observed, 180 \u2212 290 pc (Padoan et\nal. 2001; Elmegreen et al. 2001; Kim & Park 2007). This\nfeature, seen in the HI and in the young stars, has been\nsuggested to relate to the scale height of the galaxy, where\nstructures begin to change from largely 3D to 2D objects. We\nnote that Odekon (2008) also found a break in the autocorrelation function for young stars in M33, whereas no similar\nscale was identified in the study of Bastian et al. (2007).\nWe confirm the results found for M33, that the turnover in the size-distribution depends on the breaking distance used in an almost one-to-one way, suggesting that\nprevious reports of a characteristic size in star-forming regions were due to the selection of a single breaking distance. Hence, we confirm that the LMC does not display evidence for a characteristic scale in the star-formation process.\nSimilar results were found for the spiral galaxy NGC 628\n(Elmegreen et al. 2006).\n\n3.2\n\nLuminosity distribution\n\nThe luminosity of each group was found by summing the\nV-band luminosity of all the stars found to be part of the\ngroup. For simplicity, we just concentrate on the 'total sample' (i.e. all of the derived groups with multiple detections\nremoved), although we note that the results for each breaking distance were similar. The cumulative luminosity distribution is shown in Fig. 2, along with a power-law fit to the\ndata of the form N dL \u221d L\u2212\u03b1 dL, shown as a solid (red) line.\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. The cumulative luminosity distribution of the total\nsample of groups. The solid line shows the best fit to the data of\nthe form N (dL) \u221d L\u2212\u03b1 dL, where the best fitting \u03b1 and error are\ngiven in the panel.\n\nWe find that the distribution is well fit by such an analytic\nform, with \u03b1 = 1.94 \u00b1 0.03. This is in excellent agreement\nwith what was found for the group luminosity function in\nM33 (Bastian et al. 2007). It is also in good agreement with\nthe study of groups of OB stars in the SMC based on the\nMST method by Oey, King & Parker (2004). The implications of this are discussed in detail in Bastian et al. (2007).\nWe note that the luminosity function may not directly relate\nto the mass function of the groups if there is a substantial\nage spread in the groups or if the initial mass function (IMF)\nof stars is dependent on environment (i.e. since we only sample the upper end of the stellar IMF we are insensitive to\nany fluctuations below our sample limits).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF\nSUBSAMPLES\nAge groups and galactic structure\n\nThe above sections dealt solely with young OB stars, however, using different colour and magnitude cuts in the CMDs\nof the LMC stars from the catalogue of Zaritsky et al. (2004),\nwe can select populations of different mean ages. This is\ndone by taking colour-magnitude regions (corrected for foreground extinction of 0.41, 0.32, 0.25, 0.15 mag for U, B, V,\nand I, respectively) along the main sequence and red-giant\nbranches of the CMD. In order to minimize the effect of\nlarger contamination in the outskirts of the galaxy, and to\nassure complete geometrical coverage, we limited our selection to the inner three degrees (in radius) of the LMC.\nFor selection of the age boxes we follow the same\nprocedure as Gieles, Bastian, & Ercolano (2008, hereafter\nGBE08). The adopted regions are shown in Figure 3, where\nthe sizes of the boxes were chosen such that they enclose\n2000 stars within their boundaries. In order to determine the\naverage age of each of the boxes, we constructed a synthetic\npopulation of stars, assuming a constant star-formation rate\nand a random sampling from a Salpeter initial mass function\n(1955). We used the Padova isochrones (Girardi et al. 2002\nand references therein, Z=0.008) to assign a magnitude and\n\n\f4\n\nBastian et al.\nTable 1.

We then find the number of stars at each age which\nfall into our colour-magnitude regions, and take the mean\nage of the stars which are contained within the designated\nregion. Two examples (boxes 2 and 6) are shown in Fig. 4.\nThe selection cuts and mean ages are shown in Table 1. We\nnote that using the median age of each box instead of the\nmean does not significantly change our conclusions. Since we\nare using a CMD to select stars, the primary parameter that\nwe are selecting is in fact stellar mass and not stellar age.\nWe implicitly assume that high and low mass stars (above\na few solar masses) have the same spatial distribution.\nOnce the boxes have been selected we can then look at\nthe spatial positions of the stars for each box. Six examples\nare shown in Fig. 5 where the box number and mean age are\ngiven in each panel. It is clear that the younger populations\ncontain considerably more substructure than the older populations. The LMC bar is clearly visable in the older boxes,\nnamely boxes 7, 9, and 12 in Fig. 5, and is clearly dominating the spatial distribution in box 12. In the next section we\nwill quantify these differences.\n\n5\n\nSPATIAL ANALYSIS - QUANTIFYING\nSTRUCTURES\n\nFigure 3. Colour-magnitude diagram used to select the boxes.\nThe size of the boxes was determined by requiring 2000 sources\nin each colour-magnitude box. Stellar isochrones from the Padova\ngroup (Girardi et al. 2002) are shown for logarithmic stellar ages\n(in years) of 7, 7.5, 8, 9, & 10 and Z=0.08 metallicity.\n\n5.1\n\nQ parameter\n\nCartwright & Whitworth (2004) have developed a formalism to quantify the structure of young star clusters. Their\nmethod uses the normalised mean MST branch length, m,\nand the normalised distance between all sources within a region, s. The ratio between these two quantities, m/s= Q, is\nable to distinguish between a power-law (centrally concentrated) profile and a profile with sub-structure (i.e. a fractal\ndistribution). Additionally, this parameter can quantify the\nindex of the power-law or the degree of sub-substructure,\nwhich, if one assumes is due to a fractal nature, its fractal\ndimension can also be estimated. Assuming a three dimensional structure, if Q is less than 0.79 then the region is\nfractal, larger than 0.79 refers to a power-law structure, and\na value of 0.79 implies a random distribution (a 3D fractal\nof dimension 3 is a random distribution). However, if the\ndistribution is two dimensional, as is approximately true if\none is looking at a disk-like galaxy face on (like the LMC),\nthen a random distribution has a Q value of 0.72.\nWhile this method was developed and has been applied\nto young embedded clusters (Cartwright & Whitworth 2004,\nSchmeja & Klessen 2006, Kumar & Schmeja 2007), it has\nalso recently been applied to full stellar populations within\nthe SMC (GBE08), finding that the Q parameter increases\nwith the mean stellar population age.\nDuring our analysis, we found an unexpected relation\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fThe evolution of structure in the LMC\n\n5\n\nFigure 5. The spatial positions of the stars in boxes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, & 12. Only the inner three degrees in radius are used in the analysis.\nThe bar of the LMC is clearly visable in older populations, and dominates in age box 12.\n\nbetween the measured Q value and the elongation parameter\nintroduced by Schmeja & Klessen (2006), in that more elongated clusters have a lower Q-value. We note here, that while\nthis does not affect our results (each box has an elongation\nless than 1.2) it may be a serious problem for young embedded clusters which often have a filamentary structure (e.g.\nGutermuth et al. 2008). This issue and a proposed solution\nare dealt with in more detail in Appendix A. Additionally, in\nAppendix B we discuss the effects of differential extinction\non the Q parameter.\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 6 we show the measured Qvalue for each of our 12 boxes (filled circles). The Q-value is\nclearly increasing with age, beginning at a value of Q = 0.57.\nIn order to measure the age at which the spatial distribution\nbecomes uniform, we fit the Q-value as a function of the logarithm of age (shown as a dashed line in the bottom panel\nof Fig. 6 and calculate when this function crosses that of a\nflat distribution (i.e. when the Q-value becomes constant).\nThis happens at \u223c 168 \u00b1 30 Myr, where the error was calculated by the uncertainty in the value of the flat region of\nthe diagram, with a value of 0.73.\nThis is similar to what is expected for a 2D slightly centrally concentrated stellar distribution (a 2D power-law distribution with index 0.3, decreasing outward; Cartwright &\nWhitworth 2004), as is our reference distribution (see \u00a7 5.2).\nThis indicates that the spatial distribution of the stars becomes more homogeneous as the populations age. However,\nbox 12 has a much larger Q-value, which we attribute to the\nLMC bar, a strongly centrally concentrated 3D structure\nin the galaxy. Errors were estimated by generating artificial\npopulations with the same number of sources, deriving their\nQ-value, and taking the standard deviation.\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n5.2\n\nTwo point correlation function\n\nThe second technique that we used to determine the\ntimescale for structures to be erased in the LMC is the twopoint correlation function (TPCF). This method determines\nthe distance between all possible pairs of stars (ds ), shown as\na histogram, which is then normalized to that of a reference\ndistribution, i.e. Nlinks (ds ) / Nreference (ds ). Here, Nreference\nis taken as taken to be a slightly centrally concentrated powerlaw with index 0.3, which is a good representation of the\ninner three degrees of the LMC for stars with V < 20. This\nis similar to that done by Gomez et al. (1993) who used the\nTPCF to study the distribution of pre-main sequence stars\nin Taurus, although these authors used a random distribution as their reference distribution. We are then left with\na histogram for each age box of the number of connections\nwith a certain distance, relative to the reference distribution. For each of the age boxes we fit the distribution (in a\nlogarithm of distance vs. logarithm of the number) with a\nlinear relation to get the slope and zero-point.\nIf the distributions are becoming more similar to the\nreference distribution, then the slope and zero-points should\ntend towards values of 0 (see Appendix C for a demonstration of this). The results for all age boxes are shown in the\ntop and middle panels of Fig. 6. Similar to the Q-parameter\nmethod, we find that the distribution for the boxes is approaching the reference distribution as the mean stellar age\nincreases, for both the zero-point and slope of the distributions. The fact that the values do not go precisely to zero\nis most plausibly due to a slight mis-characterization of the\nreference distribution. Errors on each of the points were calculated by randomly selecting 1100 stars in the age box and\nrepeating the analysis.\nAs can be seen by comparing all three panels in Fig. 6,\n\n\f6\n\nBastian et al.\n\nFigure 4. Examples of the age dating process. The histogram\nshows the fraction of stars which fall in our colour-magnitude\nselection box. The dashed line shows the mean age of all the stars\nwhich fall in the colour-magnitude box. See text for details.\n\nthe three measurements of the disappearance of substructure\nagree very well. For the two measurements provided by the\nTPCF, we fit the zero-point and slope as a function of the\nlogarithm of age (shown as dashed lines), and find that this\ncrosses the flat portion of the diagrams at 175 \u00b1 25 Myr,\nwhere the error indicates the uncertainty in defining the flat\nregion of the diagram.\n5.3\n\nComparison of the methods\n\nThe three measurements2 of the erasure of substructure\nwithin the galaxy (the Q-parameter, and the slope and zeropoint of the TPCF) are all in close agreement.\nThese results show that stars are formed with a large\namount of substructure in the LMC and that, as this population evolves, it becomes more uniform, becoming statistically\nindistinguishable from the background reference distribution\nwithin \u223c 175 Myr. Through the Q-parameter, and comparing with artificially generated distributions, as was done in\nCartwright & Whitworth (2004), we estimate that stars are\nborn with a fractal distribution, with a 2D fractal dimension\nof \u223c 1.8.\n2\n\nWhile we have three measurements, we caution that only two\nare independent, as the slope and zero-point of the TPCF are\nintimately related.\n\nFigure 6. The results of the three measurements (two techniques)\nof the erasure of substructure within the LMC. The top and middle panels show the measured zero points and slopes of the two\npoint correlation function for all age boxes. As the reference distribution we use a centrally concentrated power-law distribution\nwith index 0.3. Note the smooth transition from younger (more\nsubstructure) boxes to older ones. Both the zero point and slope\ndistributions become flat at \u223c 175 Myr, suggesting that most\nsubstructure has been erased by this age. The results of the Qparameter are shown in the bottom panel, which largely agree\nwith the results of the TPCF, i.e. that structure is erased in\n\u223c 170 Myr. Additionally, we show the evolution of Q for the\ncluster sample of Hunter et al. (2003).\n\nSuch evolution of stellar structures has also been seen\nin NGC 1313 (Pellerin et al. 2007) and NGC 4449 (Annibali et al. 2007) using HST-ACS data. Both studies found\nthat massive stars (OB stars) contain more structure than\nolder stellar populations. Pellerin et al. (2007) explain this\nevolution of structure as due to 'infant mortality', i.e. that\nyoung stars are often formed in dense clusters which then\n'pop' (Kroupa 2002) when the residual gas left over from\nthe star-formation process leaves the cluster (e.g. Bastian &\nGoodwin 2006). Due to our ability to quantify the timescale\nand degree of clustering we can rule out this scenario, which\nwe will return to in \u00a7 6.1.\nIn such statistical analyses as presented here, contaminating sources may potentially seriously affect the results. In\norder to estimate the magnitude of these effects we have run\na series of simulations where we generate artificial distributions with known parameters, and substitute random (or reference) distributions with a given percentage. The results of\nthese experiments are shown and discussed in Appendix C.\nIn particular, we note that young stars will contribute to\nall age boxes (with the exception of box 12), and since they\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fThe evolution of structure in the LMC\ndisplay a larger degree of substructure, some degree of substructure is expected to be present in all boxes. However,\nthe contamination is expected to be low (much less than\n30%), hence the statistical methods should not be affected\nby them, although they can be seen by eye in Fig. 5.\n\n6\n\nCOMPARISON OF OPTICAL GROUPS,\nYOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS AND\nSTELLAR CLUSTERS\n\nIn order to further understand the evolution of stellar structures within the LMC we take advantage of two recent surveys. The first is that of Whitney et al. (2008) who used the\nSAGE (Meixner et al. 2006) multi-band Spitzer survey of the\nLMC to select high probability young stellar objects (YSOs).\nThese populations are expected to trace the evolution of\nforming stars/clusters from the parent clouds, through the\nembedded phase to the point where they can be detected at\noptical wavelengths. The second survey was that of Hunter\net al. (2003) who catalogued the cluster population of the\nLMC, and measured spatial positions, magnitudes, and ages\nfor over 900 clusters.\nConstraining the YSO sample to the inner three degrees of the LMC (as was done for the optically selected\nsamples) we find QYSO = 0.68. This is significantly higher\nthan that found for the young optically selected (OB star)\nsample (QOB = 0.57). Since AGB stars and YSOs have similar colours even in the mid-IR (e.g. Whitney et al. 2008) it\nis possible that this difference is due to contamination of the\nYSO sample. If it is due to contamination (see Appendix C)\nthen this implies that the YSO sample has approximately\n40% contamination from stars which have a similar distribution to that of our reference distribution. This may be\nthe case if AGB stars are the main contamination. The alternative interpretation, is that the YSO sample is made up\nlargely of lower-mass stars than our OB star sample (Whitney et al. 2008), and that the distribution of star formation is\nmass dependent. Such extreme spatial dependence on mass\nappears to be at odds with observations of young Galactic\nstar-forming regions (as indicated by the similarity of the\nstellar IMF in different environments). Finally, we note that\nthe lower spatial resolution of the YSO sample may act as\nto raise the measured Q-value.\nFor the cluster distribution, we again limit the sample\nto the inner three degrees in order to draw useful comparisons with our optically selected samples, and additionally\nprovide a magnitude cut in the data of MV < \u22124.0 in order\nto avoid incompleteness effects in the central region. We then\nbreak the cluster sample up into 8 age bins, with each bin\ncontaining an equal number of clusters, namely 69. The resulting distribution of Q-parameters vs. cluster age is shown\nin the bottom panel of Fig. 6. As seen in the stellar distributions, the Q-parameter of the cluster populations increases\nwith mean age, and becomes flat between 100 \u2212 200 Myr.\nThe larger scatter in the cluster points relative to the stellar\nboxes is due primarily to the lower number of points used\nto calculate Q (69 vs. 2000). Overall, the cluster population\nloses structure in a similar way to the stellar population, and\nif anything, the structure removal is faster for the clusters.\nWe will return to this point in \u00a7 6.1.\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n6.1\n6.1.1\n\n7\n\nInterpretations: Infant mortality vs. general\ngalactic dynamics\nInfant Mortality\n\nIt has been shown that the majority of clusters that form become disrupted within the first few 10s of Myr of their lives\n(e.g. Lada & Lada 2003). The mechanism believed to be responsible for this is the rapid removal of gas, due to stellar\nwinds and/or supernovae, from the natal cluster. This gas\nremoval leaves the cluster in an unbound state due to the\nremoval of a large fraction of the gravitational potential of\nthe cluster, that leaves the remaining stars in a super-virial\nstate. If the star-formation efficiency is low (< 30%) the entire cluster may become unbound and expand rapidly. These\ntypes of clusters have been referred to as 'popping clusters'\n(Kroupa 2002) and evidence of their expanding nature has\nbeen seen in their low light-to-mass ratios for a given age\n(Goodwin & Bastian 2006). The clusters are predicted to\nexpand with a velocity close to their velocity dispersion and\nmay have a severe effect on the observed galactic structure.\nThe standard scenario for the 'popping' clusters is that\nthe stars and gas are in, or close to, virial equilibrium when\nthe natal gas is removed. Thus, we can use the virial equation\nto find the relation between a cluster's mass (gas+stars) and\nvelocity dispersion (e.g. Spitzer 1987). Due to the relatively\nlow star-formation rate in the LMC we do not expect a large\npopulation of massive clusters. Assuming a stochastically\nsampled power-law mass function of the clusters (gas+stars)\nwith index \u22122, lower mass limits of Mlow = 1, 10, & 100 M\u2299 ,\nand cluster radii of 1 pc, we can set up a simple model of the\nevolution of the structure of a galaxy due to infant mortality.\nWe start with a spatial distribution of clusters with the\nsame Q-value as the youngest observed clusters. At each of\nthese cluster centres we place a cluster of mass Mcl and radius 1 pc We then assign a number of stars to each cluster,\ndirectly proportional to its mass, with a gaussian spatial\ndistribution (stochastically sampled). The velocity dispersion of each cluster (gas+stars) is derived through the virial\nequation, assuming a given star-formation efficiency (SFE,\nc.f. Goodwin & Bastian 2006). The cluster expansion is mimicked by increasing Rcl , with Rcl = tdis \u03c3cl , where tdis is the\ntime since the cluster began expanding and \u03c3cl is the cluster\nvelocity dispersion. At each timestep, we select 1000 stars at\nrandom and calculate their Q-value. Only stars within the\ninner 3 degrees (the simulations were set up relative to the\nobserved LMC distribution) were selected.\nThe results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 7,\nwhere the top, middle and bottom panels represent simulations where the mass function of the clusters is sampled\ndown to 100, 10, & 1 M\u2299 respectively. Since we have used\nthe same number of clusters in each simulation, the horizontal shift in the simulations is related to the average velocity\ndispersion of the clusters, which decreases with decreasing\nMlow . If clusters start more compact (as suggested by observations of young clusters, e.g. Mackey et al. 2007, Bastian\net al. 2008), this would shift the curves to the left.\nThe cluster mass function is thought to be continuous\ndown to single stars (e.g. Oey et al. 2004), arguing for the\napplicability of the simulations with Mlow = 1 M\u2299 . This\nsuggests that the erasure of structures is not being driven\nby 'popping clusters'. However, a caveat to these simulations is that we have assumed that all clusters pop in the\n\n\f8\n\nBastian et al.\n\nsame manner, regardless of mass. This, however, may not\nbe true, as the number of O-stars (which drive the gas removal, and hence the 'popping') in the cluster may influence\nthe expansion properties (e.g. Baumgardt & Kroupa 2008).\nAdditionally, we have not taken the motion of the clusters\nthrough the galaxy into account which also destroys substructure (see \u00a7 6.1.2).\nWe can test the effect of infant mortality another way,\nnamely by looking at the evolution of the Q-value for stars\nand that for catalogued star clusters. If infant mortality was\na dominant cause of structural evolution within the galaxy,\nthen we would expect the Q-values of the stars to increase\nmore rapidly with age than that of clusters. This is because\nthe star clusters which survive the 'infant mortality' phase\nwill not have their positions changed, whereas the stars that\nformed in clusters that 'popped' will be expanding away\nfrom their natal positions. In other words, the stars will\nhave two components to their velocity, namely expansion\nand motions through the galaxy, whereas clusters will only\nhave one component, the velocity dispersion of the galaxy.\nFor the cluster catalogue we use the Hunter et al. (2003)\nsurvey presented in \u00a7 6. In the bottom panel (open circles) of\nFig. 6 we show the measured Q-value for each of the cluster\nsub-samples. In general we see the same behavior as found\nfor the stellar boxes, namely that the Q value increases with\nmean age, beginning with a highly fractal, or substructured\ndistribution and becoming flat near the same value as that\nfound for the stellar boxes. The evolution between the stars\nand clusters is quite similar, in fact the clusters seem to\nevolve slightly faster (although this does not appear to be\nstatistically significant given the small number of clusters\nper age bin) than the stars. Hence we conclude that the same\nmechanism is erasing the substructure seen in the stellar\nand cluster distributions, which eliminates the possibility\nthat 'popping clusters' are the dominant cause, although\nthis effect is likely taking place within the galaxy.\n6.1.2\n\n3 \u2212 4 kpc this translates to a crossing time (tcross = R/\u03c3) of\n\u223c 135\u2212180 Myr. This is remarkably similar to the timescale\nderived for the elimination of structure within the LMC.\nFrom this, we conjecture that structure will be erased on a\ncrossing-time, independent of spatial scale. This may explain\nwhy young lower-mass clusters often contain large amounts\nof substructure (e.g. Gutermuth et al. 2005), while many\nof the massive young clusters (such as Orion) have much\nsmoother central regions, where the crossing time is significantly lower than the outer regions (see Elmegreen 2008).\nIn GBE08 we show the same quantitative relationship\nbetween the stars and clusters in the SMC and reach a similar conclusion, namely that popping clusters are not driving\nthe evolution of substructure within the galaxy. In the SMC,\nsubstructure is removed in \u223c 80 Myr, which is again similar\nto the galactic crossing time. Note that the erasure of structure in the 'popping cluster' scenario (e.g. Fig. 7) is mainly\ndependent on the average internal velocity dispersion \u03c3mean\nof the clusters. Since \u03c3mean is independent of the number\nof clusters in a population (it only depends on the mass\nfunction index and lower mass limit of clusters - which we\nassume to be invariant) then all galaxies should have structure erases in approximately the same time. However, in the\ntimescale of structure erasure is twice as fast as in the LMC.\nAn interesting difference between the SMC and LMC\nstellar and cluster distributions is the Q-values which they\nattain when the become flat. For the SMC the Q-value of\nboth clusters and stars becomes flat at Q = 0.81 whereas\nfor the LMC, both distributions become flat at Q = 0.73.\nThis difference shows the ability of the method to quantify the structure of distributions, as the SMC is largely\nthree dimensional whereas the LMC is mostly disk-like, or\ntwo dimensional (both slightly centrally concentrated). The\nexpected Q-values for homogeneous 2D and 3D distributions are 0.71 and 0.79, respectively (Cartwright & Whitworth 2004), therefore explaining the observed difference\nbetween the Q-values in the LMC and SMC.\n\nGalactic Dynamics\n\nWe conclude that the dominating effect of structure evolution in the LMC is general galactic dynamics. It is the\nvelocity dispersion of the galaxy which eliminates substructures and pushes the stellar distributions toward a random,\nor background, distribution.\nThese results are consistent with the findings of the distribution of Cepheids in the Galaxy (Efremov 1995) and the\nLMC (Marconi et al. 2006). For the Galaxy, Efremov (1995)\nfound evidence for the presence of large 'Cepheid clouds'\nwith sizes of a few hundred parsecs, which, considering the\nage of Cepheids (a few 10s to 100s of Myr) is what is expected from our results. More directly, Marconi et al. (2004,\ntheir Figs. 4 & 5) found that young Cepheids (20 \u2212 80 Myr)\ndisplay much more substructure in their spatial distribution\nthan older Cepheids (> 80 Myr) whose distribution is becoming closer to random, in agreement to that found by\nElmegreen & Efremov (1996). Finally, we note that this is a\nsimilar timescale (\u223c 150 Myr) to that found by Efremov &\nElmegreen (1998) for the average separation between pairs\nof star clusters in the LMC to become constant, i.e. for the\ncluster population to become statistically uniform.\nThe LMC has a velocity dispersion of \u223c 22 km/s (Carrera et al. 2008), if we adopt a radius of the LMC of\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented an analysis of the spatial distribution\nof stellar structures within the LMC. By using the Zaritsky et al. (2004) Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey and\nsampling different parts of the stellar colour-magnitude diagram, we have selected stellar populations of varying mean\nage. This is supplemented with other datasets, namely the\nWhitney et al. (2008) Young Stellar Object (YSO) infrared\nsample and the star cluster catalogue of Hunter et al. (2003).\nBased on the analysis of the distribution of OB stars,\nwe confirm our earlier results on M33, namely that the starforming groups are well approximated by a power-law luminosity function with index of \u22122 and that there is no preferred size in the distribution of star-forming sites (e.g. that\nof the OB association). Instead, we find a continuous distribution of sizes, and find that previous reports of a characteristic size were due to resolution effects, along with choosing,\napriori, a single size-scale to probe.\nWe have used two methods to quantify the amount of\nsubstructure within a galaxy, the Q method (Carthwright\n& Whitworth 2004), and the two-point correlation function\n(TPCF). We found that stars are formed in a highly strucc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fThe evolution of structure in the LMC\n\n9\n\nof structural change. It is worth noting that our results are\nnot necessarily in contradiction with the 'infant mortality'\nscenario, but they show that this mechanism does not explain the observed evolution of stellar structure in galaxies.\nOnly a small fraction of stars are born in stellar clusters\nwhich will survive long enough to be able to be identified as\n'clusters' in optical surveys (e.g. Lada & Lada 2003, Gieles\n& Bastian 2008, Bastian 2008). Whether this is due to a high\nfraction of stars born in embedded 'clusters' which quickly\ndisrupt or due to a large fraction of stars forming outside\nclusters (or more likely, some combination of these two extremes) is still an open question at the moment.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully thank Simon Goodwin for discussions and help\nwith generating fractal distributions.

Simulated evolution of a galaxy due to infant mortality\nfor various star formation efficiencies (SFE), see text for details of\nthe simulations. Three values of the lower mass limit of the cluster\nmass function are given. All simulations begin with clusters with\nradii of 1 pc. The observed change in Q vs. time is shown as filled\ncircles.\n\ntured way (approximating the distribution as a 2D fractal we\nfind the fractal dimension to be \u223c 1.8) and that this distribution evolves rapidly, becoming indistinguishable from the\nbackground or reference distribution after \u223c 175 \u00b1 30 Myr.\nWe also found that the distribution of stellar clusters follows\nthat of the stars of similar age, adding confidence in our age\ndating method as well as our structural analysis.\nThus, our findings suggest that stars are formed in a\nhighly substructured distribution and that this distribution evolves rapidly, with small scale structures dispersing\nfirst, and that all of the original structure is removed in\n\u223c 175 Myr. This is approximately the crossing time of the\ngalaxy and as such, we suggest that structures in galaxies,\npresumably regardless of spatial scale, are eliminated in a\ncrossing time. Similar analysis done on the SMC (GBE08)\nfinds that substructure is erased on \u223c 75 Myr, which is comparable to the crossing time of that galaxy.\nBy comparing the observations to simple models, we\nconclude that infant mortality (or 'popping star clusters')\nhave a negligible effect on the stellar distribution in the\nLMC and that general galactic dynamics is the major driver\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\nAllen, L., et al. 2007, Protostars and Planets V, 361\nAnnibali, F., Aloisi, A., Mack, J., Tosi, M., van der Marel, R.

For consistency, we define\nthe elongation in the same way as Schmeja & Klessen (2006),\nnamely as the ratio of the derived radius when approximating the region as a circle to the radius when using the convex\nhull method. Schmeja & Klessen (2006) give the relation between the elongation and the major to minor axis ratio of\nan ellipse.\nIn order to test the effect we first create 3D spherical\nmodels of varying fractal dimensions, uniform distribution\nand various centrally concentrated profiles, similar to what\nwas done in Cartwright & Whitworth (2004). We then multiply one of the three principle axes by a factor and measure the Q value and elongation along the three projected\naxes. The results for two fractal models (fractal dimensions\nof 2.0 and 2.5), a uniform distribution and a centrally concentrated distribution with power-law radial index of -2 are\n\nshown in Fig. A1. It is clear that increasing the elongation\ndecreases the measured Q value. We have also fit each relation with a linear slope shown as a dashed line. The error\nbars represent the standard deviation of three realisations\nof the simulations (the fractal models begin with a random\nseed).\nWhile the slope of the change in Q as a function of the\nelongation is somewhat dependent on the starting Q value\n(i.e. what type of distribution is used) the overall trend is\nquite similar for all profiles considered. As such, we use the\naverage slope of the distributions in the left panel of Fig. A1\nin order to provide a correction function. For this we find\nQintrinsic = Qobs \u2212 (\u22120.208 \u2217 elongation) \u2212 0.229. The right\npanel of Fig. A1 shows the resulting values of the simulations\n(shown in the left panel) after this correction has been applied. Here the dashed lines represent the input Q value (i.e.\nthat determined for the profile where no elongation has been\napplied). While the given correction appears to correct well\nthe simulations we note that large errors can be expected\nfor systems with high elongations (> 1.5, i.e. major/minor\naxis ratios greater than 2).\n\nAPPENDIX B: FRACTAL MODELS:\nEXTINCTION EFFECTS ON Q\nAn additional affect which may influence the measured Q\nparameter is that of differential extinction. This can be realized conceptually by imagining a uniform stellar population\nand putting a highly sub-structured distribution of gas/dust\nin the line of sight. If the opacity is high enough, this will\nremove whole sections of the stellar distribution from sight,\ncreating the appearance of a non-uniform stellar population.\nHere, we we attempt to quantify this affect.\nFor the simulations we make 3D fractal distributions of\npoint sources with dimension 2.0 following the method presented in Goodwin and Whitworth (2004). For each simulation we create 20,000 gas particles and 1,000 stellar particles\nindependently. We then chose a line of sight and counted the\nnumber of gas particles between the observer and each star\nwithin some projected tolerance, i.e. we find the surface density of gas between the observer and each star. Stars which\nwere found to have gas surface densities above a certain\ncritical value were removed from the dataset. Finally, we\ncalculate Q for the original (non-extincted) and extincted\ndatasets and compare their values. Three projections of one\nof the simulations are shown in Fig. B1 where the contours\nrepresent the integrated column density of gas along the line\nof sight, red circles are stars which have been removed from\nthe original dataset (i.e. are found to be extincted), and\ngreen circles represent stars which were not extincted (i.e.\nthe red and green circles together make up the initial stellar\ndistribution).\nThe main result is that extinction from clouds tends to\nlower the value of Q, where the change is related to the number of stars removed (i.e. the opacity of the clouds). Typical\nchanges in the derived Q value, \u2206Q, are lowered by 0.04 to\n0.08 when 20% or 50% of the sources are extincted out of the\nsample, respectively. This makes the distribution appear to\nhave a lower fractal dimension than the actual distribution.\nWe have tested the effect of varying the number of particles\nused and the input fractal dimensions of the distribution\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\n\fThe evolution of structure in the LMC\n\n11\n\nFigure A1. The effect of elongation on Q. Right: To correct for the effect of elongation we have taken the average slope of the\nsimulations (shown in the left panel). Doing this we find Qintrinsic = Qobs \u2212 (\u22120.208 \u2217 elongation) \u2212 0.229.\n\nand found that both effects are minimal. Finally, we test\nthe effect of culling the stars randomly and find that this\ndoes not change the value of Q (\u2206Q < 0.015).\nSince an unphysically large number of stars must be\nextincted out of our sample before Q is affected, we conclude\nthat extinction does not significantly affect our results.\n\nAPPENDIX C: FRACTAL MODELS: EFFECTS\nOF CONTAMINATION\nDue to a variety of effects, some contamination may be expected to enter observational datasets. This could be due\nto field stars in the Galactic halo or young (lower-mass)\nstars which have colours and magnitudes which fall in the\nCMD boxes used to selected older age stars. In order to\nestimate the strength of these effects we have constructed\nthe following experiments. We start with a 2D projection\nof a 3D fractal model, chosen to have a similar Q-value as\nour youngest stellar age-box. We then replace a fraction of\nthe model stars, whose positions are chosen according to\nthe probability function of a background distribution. For\nthe background we chose three distributions (all 2D distributions); a stochastic distribution, and two centrally concentrated distributions, both power-laws, with indices 0.3\nand 1.0. We used the prescription in Cartwright & Whitworth (2004) to construct the background distributions. The\ncentrally concentrated distribution with index 0.3 was chosen as this matches the projected radial profile of the LMC,\nwhen restricted to the inner three degrees in radius.\nThe results of the simulations are shown in Fig. C1.\nIn each case, we see the Q-value increase rapidly with increasing contamination. In particular, the Q-value in the\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n\ncentrally concentrated case (with power-law index of 0.3)\nbecomes largely flat for contamination fractions above 0.6.\nThis explains why small amounts of fractal substructure\nin the older age boxes (due to young stars which enter our\nselection box) do not significantly affect the results, as a\nlarge fraction of these stars would need to be present.\nFigure C2 shows how the two-point correlation function\nanalysis is affected by the same contamination. As seen in\nthe Q-distribution, the slope and zero-point of the TPCF\nsmoothly transform from the value expected for a fractal\ndistribution, to that expected for the background or reference distributions.\nThus we conclude that while younger stars (which display more substructure) will contribute to all age boxes, this\neffect will not significantly alter our conclusions, as the expected contamination is low, their distribution will not significantly change the measured Q distribution or alter the\nTPCF.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/ LATEX file prepared\nby the author.\n\n\f12\n\nBastian et al.\n\nFigure B1. Three projections of a simulation on the effect of extinction on the measured value of Q. Both the gas particles and the\nstars are given a three dimensional fractal distribution of dimension 2.0. The (blue) contours represent the number density distribution\nof gas particles in the simulations (integrated along the line of sight) while the green and red circles represent stars (i.e. together they\nmake up the initial sample). The red circles are stars which have been extincted and hence are not 'detected' while the green circles are\nstars which are not extincted enough to be removed from the sample (see text for details). The full sample of stars has a Q value which\nis 0.07 \u00b1 0.03 higher than that of the detected sample.\n\nFigure C1.
