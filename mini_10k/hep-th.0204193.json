Although this duality allows to perform numerous explicit\ncalculations in the supergravity limit an honest proof of this conjecture directly from\nstring theory is still elusive. Therefore, the best we can do, is to take the results obtained\nfrom supergravity as predictions and make qualitative and, more desirably, quantitative\ncomparisons with field theory. Indeed, it is an interesting task in itself to study known\nphenomena of quantum field theories and try to understand how they are realized on\nthe dual string/gravity side. Most of the comparisons have been performed for the\nN = 4 SYM theory at the conformal point. Naturally, one may wonder whether the\nAdS/CFT correspondence can be checked away from conformality as well. This question\nhas been answered positively in [4] where we computed 2-point functions of currents in\nthe Coulomb branch of the N = 4 SYM theory and provided a non-trivial test of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence in the deep infrared of the theory. It is the purpose of this\npaper to review this work for the proceedings of the \"Corfu summer school on elementary\nparticle Physics\". Relevant literature on the Coulomb branch of N = 4 as well as other\nworks on current correlators within the AdS/CFT correspondence can be found in the\nreference list of our original paper [4] (particularly, in [5, 6]).\nIn order to study theories with less supersymmetry and/or broken conformal symmetry, which are closer to the theories realized in Nature, deformations of the original\nconjecture [1] have been studied extensively over the past years. In this paper we are\nconcerned with the simplest modification of N = 4 SYM by turning on vacuum expectation values (vevs) of scalar fields. The N = 4 vector multiplet contains, beside the vector\npotential and four adjoint Weyl fermions, six scalars in the adjoint representation of the\ngauge group U(N). These scalars transform in the 6 of the SO(6) R-symmetry group\nand maybe represented by the N \u00d7 N matrices \u03a6i , i = 1, 2, . . . , 6. The quartic scalar\nP\npotential of the theory i<j tr[\u03a6i , \u03a6j ]2 has flat directions that are parametrized by six\ndiagonal N \u00d7 N matrices\ni\nXvev\n\ni\n\n= h\u03a6 i =\n\ndiag(X1i , X2i , . . . , XNi )\n\n,\n\nN\nX\n\nXpi = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\np=1\n\nThe corresponding Coulomb branch is (R6 )N /SN and on points away from the origin\nthe conformal symmetry is broken. The action of N = 4 SYM contains the term\nP\ni 2\ni tr(D\u03bc \u03a6 ) which couples the gauge fields to the scalars. When the latter acquire\nvevs the gauge bosons become massive. It is convenient to choose the standard real basis\nfor the SU(N) generators Jpq = epq \u2212 1/N\u03b4pq IN \u00d7N , where the matrix elements of the\nmatrices epq are: (epq )rs = \u03b4pr \u03b4qs . Hence, according to (1), we give vevs to the scalars\n~ as \u03a6\n~ = hp X\n~ p , where hp = Jpp are the generrepresented by the six-dimensional vector \u03a6,\nators of the Cartan subalgebra of SU(N). The masses of the gauge fields arise from the\nP\nterm i tr[\u03a6i , A\u03bc ]2 . After some computation we find the (mass)2 matrix with elements\n1\n\n\f[7, 4]\n~p \u2212 X\n~ q |2 ,\n(M 2 )pq = |X\n\np, q = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n\n(2)\n\nup to a numerical factor of order 1. Hence, the masses have the geometrical interpretation\nas the distances between the various vev positions distributed in the scalar space R6 .\nEquivalently, they are given by the masses of the strings stretched between the D3branes located at these points. It is clear, that some of these masses may be degenerate,\ndepending on the specific distribution of vevs.\nLet us illustrate some of the features with the toy example of a discrete distribution\nof vevs in an polygon with N vertices located on a circle of radius r0 in the 1-2 plane [8]\n~ p = (r0 cos \u03c6p , r0 sin \u03c6p , 0, 0, 0, 0) ,\nX\n\n\u03c6p = 2\u03c0p/N ,\n\np = 1, 2, . . . , N .\n\n(3)\n\nIn this case we find from (2), that [7]\nMn = 2r0 sin(\u03c0n/N) ,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhich is an exact result for any N. The degeneracy for the zero mode is dN = N \u2212 1\nP\n2\nand for the rest dn = 2(N \u2212 n). It is easily seen that N\nn=1 dn = N \u2212 1. Hence, for\nlarge N there are W-bosons with masses of order r0 and W-bosons with light masses of\norder r0 /N. For more general distributions the same result holds with r0 being replaced\nby the average value for the distribution of vevs.\n\n2\n\nCorrelators from gauge theory\n\nSince the scalars carry non-trivial R-charge, the R-symmetry is in general broken on\nthe Coulomb branch. This is the well known phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of\na global symmetry in field theory, and, therefore, we expect massless poles in the Rsymmetry current correlators for every broken symmetry generator, which correspond\nto the massless Goldstone bosons.1 In order to investigate this issue we start with the\ncase of unbroken R-symmetry where the vev's corresponding to the six scalars of the\ntheory are turned off. The R-symmetry currents J\u03bca are bilinear in the scalar fields X i ,\ni = 1, 2, . . . , 6 and transform in the adjoint of SO(6)\nJ\u03bckl =\n\n1\n2\ngYM\n\nTijkl Tr(X i \u2202\u03bc X j ) + fermions ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Tijkl = \u03b4ki \u03b4lj \u2212 \u03b4kj \u03b4ki are the components of the 6 \u00d7 6 matrices T kl of SO(6). The\nscalars X i , being free fields, have the following two-point function (in our conventions\nthe field theory action has an overall factor of 1/gY2 M )\ni\nj\n2\nhXpq\n(x)Xrs\n(0)i = gYM\n\u03b4 ij (\u03b4qr \u03b4ps \u2212\n1\n\n1\n1\n\u03b4pq \u03b4rs ) 2 ,\nN\nr\n\np, q, r, s = 1, 2, . . . , N .\n\nSee also the pedagogical lectures on spontaneous symmetry breaking [9] during this school.\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fAfter performing the Wick contractions we find the two-point function of the currents\nhJ\u03bcij (x)J\u03bdkl (0)i \u223c N 2 (\u03b4ik \u03b4jl \u2212 \u03b4il \u03b4jk )(\u0003\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd )\n\n1\n,\nr4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have kept only the leading term in the 1/N-expansion.2 This is indeed the\ncorrect result for the two point function which also agrees with the AdS/CFT result [5].\nIn the case that the symmetry is broken by turning on non-zero scalar vev's, we\ni\ni\nreplace the X i by Xvev\n+ \u03b4X i , where Xvev\nis defined in (1) and the \u03b4X i have the same\nfree field two-point function as in (6). Besides the bilinear term (5) the current contains\nnow a term linear in fluctuating fields\n\u03b4J\u03bckl =\n\n1\n2\ngYM\n\ni\nTijkl Tr(Xvev\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b4X j ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nand the leading order correction to the conformal result (7) is\nh\u03b4J\u03bcij (x)\u03b4J\u03bdkl (0)i \u223c\n\n1\n2\ngYM\n\nH ij,kl\u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd\n\n1\n,\nr2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the group theoretical factor Hij,kl takes the form\nH\n\nij,kl\n\n= \u03b4ik Ajl \u2212 \u03b4jk Ail \u2212 \u03b4il Ajk + \u03b4jl Aik ,\n\nAij =\n\nN\nX\n\nXpi Xpj .\n\n(10)\n\np=1\n\nIt is clear that, in the ultraviolet where the vev's can be neglected, the conformal result\n(7) dominates, whereas in the infrared the dominant term is (9). The symmetric tensor\nAij is given in terms of the scalar vevs only and depends on their distribution. In the\ni\nfollowing we think of the vevs Xvev\nas defining N points in R6 . In the large N limit\nsuch a discrete distribution can often be approximated by a continuous one, as long as\nwe work with energies not too close to the vev values. Furthermore, we will consider\nsituations where the distribution spans only a lower dimensional submanifold embedded\nin R6 . From (9) we see that the tensor H ij,kl contains all the important information\nabout the zero mass poles. It is antisymmetric in the indices ij and kl separately and\nsymmetric under pairwise exchange. Note that Aij is non-zero only if both indices i, j\nare along the vev-distribution. That implies that H ij,kl = 0 if all indices correspond to\ndirections which are perpendicular to the distribution.\nFor the comparison with the dual supergravity that we will perform later, it is convenient to write down the general two point function of the currents in a particular form.\nIn x-space it is given in terms of a function Gij,kl(x) as\nhJ\u03bcij (x)J\u03bdkl (0)i\n\nN2\n(\u0003\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd )\u0003Gij,kl (x) ,\n=\n4\n32\u03c0\n\n2\n\n(11)\n\nFor finite N , the N 2 factor in (7) is replaced by N 2 \u2212 1 corresponding to the dimension of the\nSU (N ) group. We also note that the contribution of the fermions only affects the result by an overall\nN -independent numerical constant which is not important for our purposes.\n\n3\n\n\fwhere the projector ensures transversality of the correlator. In turn, the function Gij,kl (x)\ncan be used to define a function H ij,kl(k) in momentum space as\nZ\nZ\nij,kl\n1\n(k)\n1 \u221e\nij,kl\n4\nik*x H\nG (x) = 2 d ke\ndkH ij,kl(k)J1 (kr) ,\n(12)\n=\n4\u03c0\nk2\nr 0\nwhere the Bessel function J1 (kr) is a result of the integration over angular coordinates.\nWe cannot use H ij,kl(k) directly because the correlator in x-space is too singular to be\nFourier transformed to momentum space. However, by using differential regularization\none can make sense of such expressions by writing singular functions as derivatives of\nless singular ones and then defining the Fourier transform by formal partial integrations\n[10].\nWe also note that the momentum space version of (9) can be expressed in terms of a\nfunction H ij,kl(k) as\n1 H ij,kl\n,\n(13)\nH ij,kl(k) \u223c \u2212 2\ngYM N 2 k 2\nwhere H ij,kl on the r.h.s. is defined in (10). We emphasize that this is the interesting\npiece of the current correlator that potentially gives rise to massless poles, i.e. Goldstone\nbosons, depending on the details of H ij,kl.\nSome examples\nThe polygon: In this toy example we consider a discrete distribution of vevs in an Npolygon whose vertices lie on a circle of radius r0 in the 1-2 plane (3). Computing the\nmatrix elements Aij using the definition (10) is straightforward, and we find that the\nonly non-zero components are A11 = A22 = Nr02 /2. We note that in this case we obtain\nthe same result even if we approximate the discrete distribution by a continuous uniform\ndistribution of vevs on the circumference of the circle.\nWe now turn to the examples with vev distributions on a disc and on a three-sphere,\nwhich will be considered in section 3 (within a more general class of examples) from the\nsupergravity side using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In these cases a direct comparison\nwith the free field calculation can be performed and we will find precise agreement.\nThe three-sphere: For a uniform distribution on a three sphere of radius r0 embedded\nin the 1-2-3-4 hyperplane it is obvious that Aii = Nr02 /4, for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and zero\notherwise. These results are most easily derived in the continuous approximation of the\n2\ndistributions. Hence, using (10), (13) and the identities gYM\n= gs and R4 = 4\u03c0gs N, we\nobtain\nr2 \u03bb\n\u03bb\n(14)\nHsphere\n(k) \u223c \u2212 04 2 ,\nR k\nwhere the parameter \u03bb = 0, 21 and 1 corresponds to currents in the transverse directions\n(unbroken SO(2)), broken currents in the coset and directions along the distribution\n(unbroken SO(4)), respectively.\n4\n\n\fThe disc: For a uniform distribution on a disc in the 1-2 plane we have similarly that\nAii = Nr02 /4, for i = 1, 2 and zero otherwise. Using (10) and (13) we compute\n\u03bb\nHdisc\n(k) \u223c\n\nr02 \u03bb \u2212 1\n,\nR4 k 2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03bb = 0, 12 and 1 corresponds to currents along the distribution (unbroken SO(2)), broken currents in the coset and directions orthogonal to the distribution\n(unbroken SO(4)), respectively.\n\n3\n\nThe supergravity side\n\nOn the dual supergravity side it is straightforward to write down the relevant supergravity\nbackground for arbitrary points on the Coulomb branch. The reason is that the vevs of\nthe scalars are simply the positions of the D3-branes in the transverse six-dimensional\nspace [11]. Furthermore, this is a BPS configuration and the full solution is simply a\nsuperposition of single D3-branes given by\n6\n\n\u221a X 2\n1\nds2 = \u221a dx2|| + H\ndxi ,\nH\ni=1\n\nH = 4\u03c0gs ls4\n\nN\nX\np=1\n\n1\n~ p |4\n|~x \u2212 X\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere x|| denotes flat worlvolume directions of the D3-brane. While it is nice to have\nthe most general solution, for practical purposes of calculating e.g. current correlators,\nit is not very useful and we will study a subspace of the Coulomb branch that (i) can\nbe studied using gauged supergravity, (ii) corresponds to continuous distributions of D3branes [12, 8] which means that the sum in (16) over localized D3-branes has to be\nreplaced by an integral over a specific D3-brane density. This will allow us to make exact\ncalculations in several cases, which can be compared with the results discussed at the\nend of section 2. In that respect, we mention the case of the two center solution, where\nN D3-branes are distributed evenly in two stacks of branes. This case has been studied\nin [13] and although it might look simpler than the ones we will encounter here, it is\nactually difficult to perform any computation exactly.\nThe advantage of (i) is that we do not have to study the ten-dimensional supergravity\nbut we can restrict ourselves to a truncation of the full theory that describes only the fields\nrelevant for our problem. In our case the relevant tool is five-dimensional N = 8 gauged\nsupergravity [14] of which we actually only need a further truncation which includes the\nmetric, the SO(6) gauge field and scalars in the coset SL(6, R)/SO(6). The Lagrangian\nfor these fields is\nL = Lscalar + Lgauge ,\n(17)\nwhere Lscalar denotes the pure gravity plus scalar sector and Lgauge contains the kinetic\nterm of the gauge fields together with their interactions with gravity and the scalars.\n5\n\n\fThe explicit form of the gravity plus scalar Lagrangian is\n\nwith the potential\n\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a Lscalar = R \u2212 Tr \u2202\u03bcb MM \u22121 \u2202 \u03bcb MM \u22121 \u2212 P ,\ng\n4\n16\n\n(18)\n\n\u0003\ng2 \u0002\n(TrM)2 \u2212 2Tr(M 2 ) ,\n(19)\n32\nwhere g is a mass scale, which is related to the AdS5 radius via g = 2/R with R =\n(4\u03c0gs N)1/4 ls . The scalar fields sit in a symmetric traceless matrix M ij where the indices\nare in the fundamental representation of SO(6), i.e. these scalars transform in the 20\u2032 .\nSupersymmetric domain-wall solutions of (18) preserving 16 supercharges together with\nfour-dimensional Lorentz invariance correspond to states on the Coulomb branch of N =\n4 SYM [15]. In this case the matrix M can be diagonalized using an SO(6) gauge\ntransformation and can be parametrized by six scalar fields\nP =\u2212\n\nM = diag(e2\u03b21 , . . . , e2\u03b26 ) ,\n\n(20)\n\nP\nobeying the constraint 6i=1 \u03b2i = 0. Alternatively one could use five independent scalar\nP\nfields \u03b1I , I = 1, 2, . . . 5 which are related to the \u03b2i 's by \u03b2i = 5I=1 \u03bbiI \u03b1I , where \u03bbiI is a\n6 \u00d7 5 matrix, with rows corresponding to the fundamental representation of SL(6, IR).\nThe ansatz for the domain wall metric is\nds2 = e2A(z) (dz 2 + \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ) = dr 2 + e2A(r) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the relation between the coordinates z and r is such that dr = \u2212eA dz. The most\ngeneral solutions is expressed in terms of an auxiliary function F (g 2 z), in terms of which\nthe conformal factor and the profiles of the scalars are [16]\n2A\n\ne\n\n2\n\n\u2032 2/3\n\n= g (\u2212F )\n\n,\n\n2\u03b2i\n\ne\n\n6\nY\nf=\n(F \u2212 bi ) ,\n\nf 1/6\n=\n,\nF \u2212 bi\n\ni = 1, 2, . . . , 6 . (22)\n\ni=1\n\nThe constants of integration are ordered as b1 \u2265 b2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 b6 and the function F obeys\nthe differential equation\n(F \u2032)4 = f .\n(23)\nEquating n of the integration constants bi (or equivalently the associated scalar fields \u03b2i )\ncorresponds to preserving an SO(n) subgroup of the original SO(6) R-symmetry group.\nIn general the hypersurface F = b1 corresponds to a curvature singularity which, however,\nhas the physical interpretation as being the location of the distribution of D3-branes once\nwe lift the solution to a Type IIB background. Furthermore, we can make contact with\nthe disc and three-sphere distributions discussed in section 2. The disc corresponds to\nsetting the integration constants b1 = b2 = b3 = b4 and b5 = b6 in which case the\nunbroken R-symmetry group is SO(2) \u00d7 SO(4) and the Goldstone bosons corresponding\n6\n\n\fto the broken symmetries reside in the coset SO(6)/(SO(2) \u00d7 SO(4)).3 For the threesphere we have to choose b1 = b2 and b3 = b4 = b5 = b6 while the unbroken symmetry\ngroup and the coset are the same as for the disc. We note that the solutions (21), (22)\ncan be lifted to type IIB solutions of the form (16) and that, this class of solutions does\nnot include the uniform distribution of vevs on a circle.\nLet us now add the gauge fields to the Lagrangian (18). The partial derivatives in\nkj\nik\n(18) are replaced by gauge-covariant ones \u2202\u03bcb M ij \u2192 \u2202\u03bcb M ij + g(Aik\n+ Ajk\n\u03bc\nbM\n\u03bc\nb M ), and\nthe gauge kinetic term has to be added\n1\n1\n\u221a Lgauge = \u2212 (M \u22121 )ij (M \u22121 )kl F\u03bcbik\u03bdb F jlb\u03bc\u03bdb ,\ng\n8\n\n(24)\n\nij\nwhere Aij\n\u03bc\nb and F\u03bc\nb \u03bdb are anti-symmetric in ij. Since we are interested in two-point functions\nwe only keep terms in (17) and (24) which are quadratic in the fluctuations \u03b4Aij\n\u03bc\nb of\nthe gauge fields and the scalar fluctuations of the symmetric unimodular matrix \u03b4M ij .\nAlthough we are only interested in the two point functions of the gauge fields we have to\nkeep scalar fluctuations since the gauge fields couple to the off-diagonal scalar fluctuations\n\u03b4M ij . However, there are no couplings of the gauge fields to the metric and the diagonal\nscalar fluctuations \u03b4M ii at quadratic order. At this point it is crucial to distinguish\nbetween gauge fields that correspond to unbroken symmetries for which \u03b2i = \u03b2j and\ngauge fields corresponding to broken symmetries for which \u03b2i 6= \u03b2j .\n\nThe case of unbroken symmetries is easier since \u03b4Aij\n\u03bc\nb fluctuations do not couple to\nscalar fluctuations. We can choose a convenient gauge \u03b4Az = 0 and the components along\nthe world volume directions A\u03bc can be decomposed into a transverse and a longitudinal\n\u22a5\npolarization A\u03bc = A\u22a5\n\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03be. The equation of motion for the physical modes A\u03bc , which\nobey \u2202 \u03bc A\u22a5\n\u03bc = 0, takes the form of a field equation for a scalar field \u03a6:\n\u2202z (eB \u2202z \u03a6) \u2212 k 2 eB \u03a6 = 0 ,\n\n(25)\n\nB = A \u2212 2(\u03b2i + \u03b2j ) ,\n\n(26)\n\nwith the definition\nwhere we have omitted for notational convenience the i, j dependence of B. Note that\nwe have also performed a Fourier transform in the x\u03bc -directions with k 2 \u2261 k\u03bc k \u03bc .\nFor the broken symmetries \u03b2i 6= \u03b2j , however, there are couplings between scalars and\ngauge fields and things become more tricky. It is a highly non-trivial fact that we can\ndecouple the scalars via the field redefinition [4]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4Mij\n1\nij\nij\n,\n\u03b2i 6= \u03b2j ,\n(27)\nA\u03bcb \u2192 A\u03bcb + \u2202\u03bcb\ng\ne2\u03b2i \u2212 e2\u03b2j\nwhich has the form of an abelian gauge transformation. Of course, this is nothing but the\nHiggs mechanism. The Goldstone boson corresponding to the broken gauge symmetries\n3\n\nSee however the comments in the paragraph starting after (42).\n\n7\n\n\fare eaten by the gauge bosons which thereby obtain a mass. Since the gauge fields are\nmassive now we cannot eliminate degrees of freedom by gauge fixing. In order to calculate\n\u03bc\nb\nthe two-point function we couple the gauge field to an external current via Aij\n\u03bc\nb Jij and\nrequire the current to be covariantly conserved D\u03bcb Jij\u03bcb = 0. The Az component decouples\nfrom the other modes which in turn is related to the longitudinal component \u03be. Again,\nthe decoupled equation for the transverse modes A\u22a5\n\u03bc , takes the form of a massive scalar\nfield equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 2\n2 \u2212B\nB\n2 B\n\u03a6=0,\n(28)\n\u2202z (e \u2202z \u03a6) \u2212 k e + g (bi \u2212 bj ) e\n4\n\nwhere the scalar \u03a6 denotes any component of A\u22a5\n\u03bc . For \u03b2i = \u03b2j , which implies bi = bj , we\nrecover from (28) eq. (25) that describes the cases with unbroken symmetry. Hence (28)\nis the general equation that can be used to calculate all current-current correlators.\nLet us shortly pause here and admire the result. In the field theory we study the\nbreaking of a global symmetry, which is signalled by the appearance of Goldstone bosons.\nIn the supergravity dual the global R-symmetry becomes a local gauge symmetry and we\nobserve a different mechanism, namely the Higgs phenomenon. The would be Goldstone\nboson becomes an additional degree of freedom of the gauge field, i.e. the gauge field\nbecomes massive. Hence, we see that in the AdS/CFT correspondence spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking in the field theory corresponds to Higgsing of a local gauge symmetry\nin the dual supergravity/string theory. In the rest of these notes we complete the picture\nby showing how the massless poles in the examples of section 2 can be reproduced from\na supergravity calculation of the current correlators using (28).\n\nWe will follow the standard procedure of [2, 3] to determine the current-current correlators using (28). We will work in Euclidean signature unless stated otherwise. In\norder to proceed we need a complete set of eigenfunctions of (28), which can be found\nexplicitely only in a small number of examples, namely for the disc and three-sphere\ndistributions [15, 17]. Furthermore, we have to keep the solutions that blow up at the\nAdS boundary since they correspond to operator insertions [2, 3]. Finally, we have to\nR\nN2\nevaluate the on shell-value of the action \u03ba12 d5 xL with \u03ba12 = 16\u03c0\n2 for solutions \u03a6 of (28).\nThis yields the boundary term\nN2 B\ne \u03a6\u2202z \u03a6\n\u01eb\u21920 32\u03c0 2\n\n\u2212 lim\n\nzmax\nz=\u01eb\n\n\u2261\n\nN2 2\nk H(k) ,\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(29)\n\nwhere we have to normalize \u03a6|z=\u01eb = 1 and take the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 in (29), which corresponds\nto the AdS boundary. Re-introducing Lorentz and group theory indices properly, we can\npresent the current-current correlators in momentum space schematically as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN2\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\nij\nkl\nhJ\u03bc (k)J\u03bd (\u2212k)i = 2 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\nk 4 G\u0303ij,kl (k) ,\n(30)\n8\u03c0\nk\nwhere a group theory factor and the momentum space version of the projector, which\nguarantees that the amplitude is transverse, have been included. The expression (30) is\nof course nothing but the momentum-space analogue of (11).\n8\n\n\fFor the cases of D3-branes distributions over a disc and a three-sphere, which were\ndiscussed in section 2, (28) can be solved explicitly [4], but in general this is not possible.\nBut since we are mainly interested in the Goldstone bosons we will take a shortcut by\nsolving (28) for small k 2 in order to extract the massless poles. It is useful to rewrite the\nequation (28) in terms of the variable F\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb2ij\nd\u03a6\nd\n2 (F \u2212 bi )(F \u2212 bj )\n(F \u2212 bi )(F \u2212 bj )\n\u2212k\n\u03a6\u2212\n\u03a6 = 0 , (31)\ndF\ndF\nf 1/2\n4(F \u2212 bi )(F \u2212 bj )\nwhere F and bi were defined in equation (22) and bij = bi \u2212 bj . In order to extract the\nmassless poles it suffices to concentrate on the limit k 2 \u2192 0, where (31) can be solved\nexactly for any distribution. This will give the leading contribution to the two-point\nfunction of currents for large distances. At the AdS boundary F \u2192 \u221e we impose the\nusual boundary condition \u03a6 \u2192 1 corresponding to a point-like source. Furthermore, we\nrequire \u03a6 to be smooth at the singularity F = b1 in the interior. In the following we use\nunits where g = 2/R = 1.\nCorrelators and comparison with field theory\nIn order to make a comparison between field theoretical and supergravity results for the\nmassless poles arising in the current correlators, we need the group theoretical factor\nH ij,kl defined in (10). It can be shown that [4]\nAij = Nb1j \u03b4ij ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere we defined bij = bi \u2212 bj . Consequently, our distributions have a diagonal matrix\nAij . Hence, the only non-zero independent components of the group theoretical factor\nH ij,kl are H ij,ij . If all indices correspond to directions which are perpendicular to the\ndistribution then H ij,kl = 0, whereas if all directions are along the distribution H ij,ij =\nN(b1j + b1i ). If we are in the coset one index is along the distribution (say i) and one is\northogonal to it (say j), then one of the above terms is missing and therefore H ij,ij = Nb1i .\nThis agrees perfectly with the two special cases of the disc and sphere distribution that\nwe considered before.\nCurrents transverse to the distribution: In this case the indices of the current i, j are\nsuch that bi = bj = b1 . Demanding regularity at the singularity F = b1 and imposing the\nnormalization condition at the boundary gives\n\u03a6=1.\n\n(33)\n\nH(k) = 0 .\n\n(34)\n\nTherefore (29) gives\nAs expected this agrees with the field theoretical results for vev distributions on a threesphere (14) and on a disc (15).\n9\n\n\fCurrents longitudinal to the distribution: In this case the indices of the current are such\nthat bi , bj 6= b1 . Imposing regularity at the singularity at F = b1 and the normalization\ncondition at the boundary, we find\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n\u00131/2 !\n\u0012\n1\nF \u2212 bi\nF \u2212 bj\nb1j\n\u03a6=\n,\n(35)\n\u2212 b1i\nbij\nF \u2212 bj\nF \u2212 bi\nfrom which, using (29), we compute\nH(k) = \u2212\n\nb1i + b1j\n.\n4k 2\n\n(36)\n\nA particularly interesting case is when bi = bj 6= b1 . Then the above expressions reduce\nto\nF \u2212 b1\n(37)\n\u03a6=\nF \u2212 bi\nand\nb1i\n(38)\nH(k) = \u2212 2 .\n2k\nThe results for the sphere (14) and disc (15) distributions correspond precisely to that\nresult with b1i = r02 /4 (b1 can be put to zero by a shift of the coordinate F ), for i = 1, 2, 3, 4\nand i = 1, 2, respectively.\nCurrents in the coset: In this case the indices of the current are bi = b1 and bj =\n6 b1 .\nProceeding as before we find\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\nF \u2212 b1\n\u03a6=\n(39)\nF \u2212 bj\nand\n\nb1i\n.\n(40)\n4k 2\nSetting b1i = r02 /4, as above, one easily sees that the result (40) agrees with the field\ntheory calculations for the disc (15) and the three-sphere (14), respectively.\nH(k) = \u2212\n\nExact expressions for the sphere and disc distributions: In the case of a three-sphere distribution it is possible to compute exactly the two-point function for current correlators\nin the supergravity side [4], since (31) admits an appropriate solution in terms of a\nhypergeometric function. Here we denote for completeness the expression for\n\u0011\n1\u0010\nr02 1 \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03c8\n((1\n+\n\u2206)/2)\n+\n\u03c8\n((1\n\u2212\n\u2206)/2)\n+\n2\u03b3\n+\nR4 k 2\n4\n\u221e\nr2 \u03bb\n1X\n2n + k\u0303 2\n= \u2212 04 2 +\n,\nR k\n2 n=1 n(4n(n + 1) + k\u0303 2 )\n\n\u03bb\nHsphere\n(k) =\n\n(41)\n\nwhere k\u0303 2 \u2261 k 2 R4 /r02 and \u03c8(z) is the standard notation for the derivative of the logarithm\nof the Gamma function \u0393(z). This expression has the correct behaviour in the infrared\n10\n\n\ffor k 2 \u2192 0 that we have already exhibited. In addition it can be shown that it gives rise\nto the correct limit for the two-point function in the ultraviolet. The discrete spectrum\nof poles at k\u0303 2 = \u22124n(n + 1), n = 1, 2, . . ., corresponds precisely to the discrete mass\neigenvalues for the normalizable solutions of (31).4\nIn the case of distribution of vevs on a disc we also obtain [4]\n1\nr02 \u03bb \u2212 1\n+ (\u03c8 ((1 + \u2206)/2) + \u03b3)\n4\n2\nR k\n2\nZ\n\u2206+1\nr02 \u03bb \u2212 1\n1 \u221e e\u2212t \u2212 e\u2212 2 t\n=\ndt\n+\n,\nR4 k 2\n2 0\n1 \u2212 e\u2212t\n\n\u03bb\nHdisc\n(k) =\n\n(42)\n\np\nwhere \u2206 = k\u0303 2 + 1. This expressions also has the correct behaviour in the infrared\nand ultraviolet limits. The branch cut for k\u0303 2 = \u22121 corresponds to a mass gap of the\ncontinuous spectrum for the associated normalizable solutions (in the Dirac sense) of\n(31).\nWe close this section by explaining a subtlety of these results. In the case of the threesphere distribution we mentioned that the unbroken R symmetry is H = SO(2) \u00d7SO(4),\nhowever we found Goldstone bosons in the coset SO(6)/H, but also in the \"unbroken\"\nSO(4) sector. The resolution of this discrepancy is that the SO(4) symmetry is accidental and is caused by the approximation of a discrete distribution by a smooth distribution over a three-sphere. Clearly, the actual discrete distribution breaks this symmetry.\nHence, the Goldstone bosons live in the larger coset SO(6)/SO(2). Similar comments\napply to the disk case where the role of SO(2) and SO(4) have to be interchanged. It\nis quite interesting that the gravity dual seems to know about this and reproduces the\ncorrect set of Goldstone bosons.\nWe have shown that the field theory and supergravity calculations can be in excellent\nagreement even beyond the conformal limit. The Goldstone bosons are sensitive to the\ninfrared physics of the field theory, which on the dual supergravity side is captured by\nthe interior of the geometry. However, for states on the Coulomb branch the supergravity\nsolutions generically have naked singularities in the interior, hence such good agreement\nis better than one could expect. We have found that spontaneous breaking of global symmetries of the field theory translates on the supergravity side to the Higgs effect of local\ngauge symmetries. It sounds somewhat counter intuitive, but the massive bulk gauge\nfields corresponding to broken symmetries conspire to reproduce the correct spectrum of\nGoldstone bosons in the dual field theory.\n\nReferences\n4\n\nWe note that in general the dilaton, transverse graviton and gauge field fluctuations have degenerate\nspectra for our models [18, 4]. This can be traced back to the fact that the corresponding fields belong\nto the same N = 4 supermutliplet. For an explicit demonstration of this, in some related cases, see [6].\n\n11\n\n\f[1] J.
