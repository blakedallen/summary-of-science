Thus, open\nclusters are excellent tracers of Galactic disk properties and give insight into the formation\nof the disk (Janes & Adler 1982; Janes & Phelps 1994; Friel 1995; de La Fuente Marcos\n& de La Fuente Marcos 2004). Unfortunately, the fundamental properties of open clusters\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nare difficult to determine. Current estimates of these properties vary widely; there is only\nmarginal agreement in the literature about the age, metallicity, reddening, or Galactocentric\ndistance of any given open cluster. Part of the disparity between estimates is due to the\nvariety of methods used to determine these quantities. The published metallicity estimates\nof an open cluster are especially prone to disagreement because each technique has different\nsensitivities to metallicity patterns, and it is likely that none of the methods, with the possible\nexception of high-resolution spectroscopy, commonly used to estimate stellar metallicity is\nmeasuring the \"true\" metallicity of the stars. Additionally, the relationship between the\nmany different techniques is often unknown. The past few decades have yielded significant\nadvances in the study of open clusters, but there is still much work to be done toward\ndetermining the fundamental properties of the more than 1500 currently known Galactic\nopen clusters.\nNonetheless, open clusters are extremely useful objects to study because each cluster\nrepresents a homogeneous set of stars. All stars in an open cluster form at the same time\nand in the same circumstances, and thus are expected to have the same age, metallicity, and\nGalactocentric distance. For this reason, open clusters are good testbeds for many types of\nGalactic studies. For example, they may be ideal objects in which to search for extra-solar\nplanets (e.g., Gonzalez 1997). Furthermore, open clusters can be metal-rich objects. Metalrich environments have recently received attention due to the suggestion (e.g., Santos et al.\n2000; Gonzalez & Laws 2000) that extra-solar planets form more readily around metal-rich\nstars. If this is the case, metal-rich open clusters may be excellent places to search for extrasolar planets. This is the primary motivation for this work; planet searches will be conducted\nin metal-rich open clusters identified in this study. These programs will be carried out by the\nSurvey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS) program (e.g. Burke\net al. 2003).\nIn this paper we present new, accurate metallicity estimates for seven open clusters\nthat were presumed to be metal-rich based on literature searches. We have obtained moderate resolution spectroscopy of giants in the target-clusters and use spectrophotometric line\nindices to produce metallicity estimates for the target-clusters.\n\n2.\n\nObservational Procedure\n\nIn this work we follow the method of Friel (1987) to determine metallicities using spectrophotometric line indices as proxies for high-resolution metallicity estimates. This procedure was adopted in several subsequent papers, including Thogerson et al. (1993), Friel\n& Janes (1993), and most recently Friel et al. (2002). Here we quantitatively assess the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nprecision of this methodology, which is described below.\n\n2.1.\n\nSample Selection\n\nThe target-clusters were selected as a precursor to a search for extra-solar planets.\nClusters to be observed were chosen on the basis of a high metallicity estimate cited in the\nliterature, as well as their location in the Galaxy. We used the Lynga (1987) database to\nselect target-clusters, with selection criteria of [Fe/H] > \u22120.2 so as not to exclude metal-rich\nclusters with large errors in their metallicity determination. We required the target-clusters\nto have distances > 300 pc, so that the stars would be bright enough to observe on our 2-m\nclass telescopes, and to have declinations \u03b4 (1950) > \u221215o , so as to be observable from the\nnorthern hemisphere. We did not put any constraints on the ages of the clusters; indeed, the\nselected open clusters span a wide range of ages. These criteria yielded a set of 26 candidate\nopen clusters.\nThese target-clusters were observed with the MDM \"Echelle\" CCD imager at the 1.3\nm McGraw-Hill telescope of the MDM Observatory1 in a preliminary observing run. During\nthis run we obtained images of the target-clusters as well as instrumental color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of each cluster. We use these images and instrumental CMDs to select\ntarget-cluster stars.\nUsing these preparatory images, we further required the selected open clusters to be\noptically distinguishable as a cluster in the 1.3 m images (the imager has a 17\u2032 field of view).\nThis constraint ensures a large number of observable stars, both in the clump (for this work)\nand in the cluster in general (for use in the planet searches). The clusters were also explicitly\nrequired to have several giant stars in or near the clump, based on the instrumental CMD, in\norder to determine accurately the metallicity of each target-cluster. The seven target-clusters\nselected from these criteria are NGC 1245, NGC 2099, NGC 2324, NGC 2539, NGC 2682,\nNGC 6705, and NGC 6819. We select giants with (B \u2212 V )0 \u2248 1 (typically red clump giants)\nin each of the target-clusters. For reference, the names of the stars in each target-cluster\nused here are those given in the WEBDA open cluster database2 . We also give the references\nfor the identifications for each cluster in \u00a74.2\nWe also observed stars of known metallicity to use as calibrators. We took calibration\nstars mainly from the survey of Friel (1987), who presents a large sample of bright field stars\n1\n\nSee http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/obs/mdm/\n\n2\n\nSee http://obswww.unige.ch/webda/\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nand cluster giants with accompanying measured indices and previously derived metallicities.\nWe took bright metal-poor calibration stars from Cottrell & Sneden (1986), while additional\ngiant stars from the old open cluster NGC 2682 were taken from Friel & Janes (1993). In\norder to minimize calibration errors between target-cluster stars and the calibrators, we\nselected calibration stars from these papers that have a color of B \u2212 V = 1 \u00b1 0.1 mag,\nroughly the same (dereddened) color as the target-cluster stars. Additionally, we observed\na few calibration stars with B \u2212 V < 0.9, in order to ensure some overlap with the color of\nthe target-cluster stars.\n\n2.2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nThe spectral data were obtained at the MDM Observatory using the CCDS spectrograph3 . We obtained one night of data (2002 January 31) on the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope,\nwhile the other seven nights of data (during 2002 March 21 - April 01) were obtained on the\n1.3 m McGraw-Hill telescope. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3800-5400 \u00c5 with the\n350 l/mm (1.33 \u00c5/pix) grating. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of an unresolved\nemission line is \u223c3 pixels, yielding a spectral resolution (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb) of \u223c1150. All spectra on\nboth telescopes use an 87 \u03bcm slit for uniformity. This slit size translates to 1\u2032\u2032 on the 2.4 m\n>\nand 1.\u2032\u2032 8 on the 1.3 m. Most spectra have formal signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) \u223c100 per pixel.\nWe observed the target-cluster stars interspersed with calibration stars of known metallicity. Thirty-five observations of 33 target-cluster stars and 56 observations of 38 calibration\nstars were made. Figures 1 \u2013 7 show the reduced spectra of all of the stars observed in each\ntarget-cluster. Figure 8 shows a selected sample of the calibration stars observed. Multiple\nobservations of some stars were included in order to ensure reproduction of Friel's method,\nto check repeatability of the measurements between telescopes, and also to have many measurements on which to base the calibration.\nWe reduced the data using standard IRAF4 routines following the usual practice of\noverscan subtraction, division by a flat field, and extraction of the spectra. Flat fields and\ncomparison lamp spectra were obtained using lamps within the instrument. We correct the\nspectra for atmospheric extinction using the standard KPNO (Kitt Peak) extinction curves\nprovided by IRAF.\n3\n4\n\nSee http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/MDM/CCDS/\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science\nFoundation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nOn each night we observed a spectrophotometric standard star from Strom (1977). The\napplication of only one standard per night (regardless of the airmass of the observations)\nmay introduce a small color effect into the spectra since the airmass has a color term and\nwe do nothing to account for the airmass of the observations. Due to the nature of the measurements (indices with continuum bands on either side of the lines), this is not a significant\nconcern. No attempt was made to do spectrophotometry, i.e., we did not align the slit with\nthe parallactic angle at each telescope pointing. This seems to have had little effect on our\nresults.\n\n2.3.\n\nMeasurement of Spectrophotometric Indices\n\nSeveral recent papers (e.g. Strader & Brodie 2004) use spectrophotometric indices as\nan estimator for the metallicity and other properties of individual stars. The indices are\nmeasured for both the program stars as well as calibration stars with well-known metallicity; the calibration star data are fit to obtain a calibration for the metallicities of the\ntarget-cluster stars. This practice is desirable because the indices may be measured with\nmoderate resolution spectra to obtain a relatively accurate (i.e., generally good to \u223c 0.15 dex)\nmetallicity estimate for the star, and obviates the need for difficult-to-obtain high-resolution\nspectroscopy. Lick indices (Burstein et al. 1984) are commonly used in this technique and\nare applied to extragalactic sources for which it is often impossible to obtain high S/N, highresolution spectra. Friel (1987) slightly altered the Lick indices to account for differences\nbetween Galactic and extragalactic sources and applied them to giant stars in the Galaxy.\nThe indices are defined as a ratio between a bandpass that incorporates several strong\nmetal lines and continuum measurements on either side of this bandpass that include little\nflux from metal lines. The final measured indices (several per star) may then be combined\nto yield a metallicity estimate for each star. For example, the Fe4680 index is defined as\n\nFe4680 = \u22122.5log R 4636.00\n4606.00\n\nR 4723.00\n\nF\u03bb d\u03bb/87\u00c5\n.\nR 4773.00\nF\u03bb d\u03bb/30\u00c5 + 4736.00 F\u03bb d\u03bb/37\u00c5\n4636.00\n\n(1)\n\nThe line and continuum regions of the indices used in this work are given in Table 1, as\nwell as the species measured by each index. This table is reproduced from Friel (1987).\nFigure 9 shows a sample moderate resolution spectrum obtained on the MDM 2.4 m\ntelescope. The central bandpasses of each measured index are shown across the bottom of\nthe figure. Figure 10 shows an enlarged section of the same spectrum, showing the central\nbandpass and accompanying continuum bandpasses for the Fe4680 index.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMetallicities of Calibration Stars\n\nAlthough the calibration stars are selected from Friel (1987), Cottrell & Sneden (1986),\nand Friel & Janes (1993), many of these stars have more recent metallicity estimates than\nthose cited in these original references. In order to minimize errors introduced into our\nanalysis from the calibration stars, we selected only field giants from Friel (1987) that had\nmetallicity estimates from a single source. Specifically, we chose metallicity estimates from\nthe Cayrel de Strobel et al. (2001) (hereafter CdS) catalog. This catalog is a compilation\nof previously published atmospheric parameters determined from high-resolution, high S/N\nspectra from a variety of sources. The 2001 version of the catalog contains bright F, G,\nand K stars in the Galactic field as well as in certain associations. We selected thirty-eight\nmetallicity standards from Friel (1987) that had at least one metallicity determination in\nthe CdS catalog; we obtained 56 measurements of these 38 stars.\nFor stars with more than one entry in the CdS catalog we combine the available entries as\nfollows. If there are two entries we average the two quoted metallicities. For stars with three\nor more entries, we discard metallicity measurements more than one standard deviation away\nfrom the median of all the measurements. We then average the remaining measurements.\nWhen only one measurement was present in the catalog, we adopt it.\nMany of the entries in CdS do not have associated error estimates; those that do are\nof order 0.1 dex. We estimate errors by finding the standard deviation of the remaining\nmetallicities once spurious measurements are discarded as described above. For stars with\nonly one or two measurements, or those for which only two measurements remained, we\nassume an error of 0.1 dex. However, this may be an overestimate of these errors, as our\nmethod reproduces metallicities of most of these field stars to higher precision (see \u00a74.1).\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Indices: Reproducibility and Comparison to Previous Index\nMeasurements\n\nTable 2 gives the measured indices of the calibration stars observed in this work along\nwith their V mag and B \u2212V colors (from the Hipparcos Catalog, ESA 1997) and metallicities\n(derived from the CdS database, as described above). Table 3 shows these data for the\ntarget-cluster stars.\nWe obtained all of the spectra with the CCDS spectrometer, and we made most of\nthe observations with the MDM 1.3 m telescope. Since all measurements were obtained\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwith the same instrument, we do not expect large systematic differences between the data\nobtained on each telescope. Several stars were observed on both of the MDM Observatory\ntelescopes. We compared the indices for the stars observed on both telescopes; the results\nare shown in Table 4. The average difference between the target-cluster stars measured on\nthe two telescopes is 0.00 and the standard deviation between the stars measured on each\ntelescope is 0.03. This difference is well within the errors of the measurements and suggests\nno systematic difference in the indices measured on the two telescopes.\nWe also observed some stars twice on the 1.3 m run. We compare the indices for the\nstars observed twice on the 1.3 m run, as well as the indices of the stars observed multiple\ntimes over both runs. No stars were observed twice on the 2.4 m run. The results are\nagain shown in Table 4. Note that in both cases the average difference between any two\nmeasurements is 0.00. The standard deviation for the stars measured twice during the 1.3\nm run is 0.04 while that for all stars measured twice (over both runs) is 0.03.\nFinally, we compare our measured indices for the calibration stars to those given in Friel\n(1987). For all of the stars that were measured both by Friel (1987) and in this work, we\nfound the difference between Friel's value of each index and ours and computed the average\nand standard deviation for all of the indices. Our indices reproduce Friel's well; the average\ndifference of the indices is \u22120.012 and the standard deviation is 0.054.\n\n3.3.\n\nReddening\n\nIn order to determine quantitatively if the interstellar reddening to the target-clusters\naffects our results, we simulated the effects of reddening on a sample spectrum. We used\nIRAF utilities to redden artificially the spectra and measured the effect of reddening on\neach of the indices. We applied an E(B-V) of 1.0 (much more extreme than any of the\ntarget-clusters should actually have; see footnotes to Table 3), and re-calculated the index\nvalues. For some indices the difference in the index between the raw spectrum and the\ndereddened spectrum was higher than the others (Ca4226 and G-band were 0.05 and 0.11\nrespectively). For the remaining nine indices the difference was 0.03 or less (roughly the\nprecision of the index measurements). However, none of the target-clusters have nearly this\nhigh of a reddening value (see the footnotes to Table 3). At the approximate reddening\nvalues applicable to our target-clusters, the effect of reddening was well below the other\nsources of error. We conclude that reddening does not significantly affect our results.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.\n4.1.\n\nResults\n\nFit to Calibrators\n\nWe begin by writing the predicted metallicity as a linear function of the 11 observed\nP\nspectrophotometric line indices fi (i = 1 . . . 11), [Fe/H]pred = 11\ni=0 ai fi , where f0 = 1. We\ndetermine the coefficients ai by making a linear fit to 56 stars that have spectroscopically\ndetermined metallicities from CdS of [Fe/H]> \u22121.5.\nWe determine which of these 11 spectrophotometric line indices are redundant as follows.\nIn the fit we arbitrarily assign each index an error of unity. Since there are 56 \u2212 12 = 44\ndegrees of freedom (dof), the resulting \u03c72 /dof of the fit gives the (square of the) scatter about\nthe fit. We then try removing each of the 12 parameters in succession and find the parameter\nthat causes \u03c72 to increase by the least. Since the number of dof has also increased (by 1),\nthe \u03c72 /dof may have increased or decreased. If it has decreased, we regard the parameter\nas redundant, remove it, and then try removing each of the remaining 11 parameters. We\ncontinue this process until \u03c72 /dof begins to increase.\nWe derive the metallicities of the target-clusters using the 56 calibrator stars. We find\nthat the target-cluster stars all have [Fe/H]> \u22120.7. Further, we find that thirteen calibrator\nstars have extremely high scatter in this fit (\u03c3 >0.15), possibly due to large errors in their\nCdS metallicity determinations. We therefore repeat the entire procedure but restricted\nto the sample of 43 calibrator star measurements that have [Fe/H]> \u22120.7, discarding the\nhigh-scatter stars. In this case, we find 5 indices are removed (Fe4530, Fe5011, Mg, Fe5270,\nFe5335). The equation used to combine the indices and produce the metallicities of the stars\nis\n\n[m/H] =\n\u22123.180415 + 4.398434 \u00d7 Fe4065 + 1.105911 \u00d7 CN4216 +\n\n(2)\n\n\u22122.480848 \u00d7 Ca4226 + \u22120.725162 \u00d7 G-band +\n2.835423 \u00d7 Fe4680 + \u22121.620898 \u00d7 Fe4920.\nThe coefficients of the indices are also presented in Table 5.\np\nThe scatter about the relation is \u03c72 /dof = 0.0709. This number reflects the quadrature sum of the root-mean-square (rms) error in the spectroscopic metallicities and the\nintrinsic scatter of the method.\nEven though the target-cluster giants are selected to have approximately the same B \u2212V\ncolor as the calibration stars, we find that the derived metallicities of the target-cluster giants\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nhave a non-negligible dependence on color. This effect is due to the fact that some of the\nstars we observed were not in the red giant clump but rather were more evolved stars on the\ngiant branch. Thus these stars have different surface temperatures and gravities than the\nrest of our clump stars. This effect is readily calibrated by removing the color dependence\nof the metallicity.\nWe compare metallicity residual (relative to CdS metallicity) to B \u2212 V color for the\nfive calibrator stars and five target-cluster stars in NGC 2682 (the target-cluster with the\nmost well-determined metallicity in the literature). The B \u2212 V colors of these stars are\ndereddened using E(B-V)=0.05 (Montgomery et al. 1993). For the five program giants\n(with no literature metallicity values) we assume the average literature value for the cluster\nmetallicity of [Fe/H]=\u22120.05. The equation of the fit is\n[F e/H]CdS \u2212 [m/H]thispaper = 1.4937 \u00d7 (B \u2212 V ) \u2212 1.5858.\n\n(3)\n\nThe derived color correction is then applied to the 35 target-cluster stars individually\nto obtain the final metallicity of each star. We assume that the spread in ages of the targetclusters has a negligible effect on this fit. More explicitly, we assume the errors associated\nwith this assumption are smaller than our other sources of error. The data and the derived\nfit are shown in Figure 11.\nFigure 12 compares our derived metallicities (after applying the color correction) to\nthose of CdS. The scatter in this relation is \u223c0.08 dex, which is only 0.01 dex larger than the\nscatter in the derivation of the original relation. We therefore estimate the overall error in\nthe method to be \u223c0.08 dex. This implies that the technique of applying a color correction\nto the derived metallicities produces acceptable results.\nNote that we use the term [m/H] to refer to our metallicity estimates. Since each\nof the spectrophotometric line indices is selected to incorporate several metal absorption\nlines, our method must measure some aspect of the star's metallicity. But since the indices\ncomprise several different metal species, this method does not necessarily measure only the\niron abundance of the star.\n\n4.2.\n\nCluster Metallicities and Comparison to Previous Determinations\n\nTable 6 shows the metallicities determined for each of the target-cluster stars, the mean\nmetallicities of each target-cluster, and the scatter in the target-cluster star metallicities. We\nreport the error for each target-cluster as the error in the mean of the target-cluster giant\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nstars: the error in the method (0.08 dex) divided by the square root of the number of giant\nstars measured in each target-cluster.\nNote that our method differs in a significant way from previous papers using spectrophotometric line indices to derive metallicities: we combine all of the measured indices at once\nusing \u03c72 analysis, whereas others (e.g., Friel & Janes 1993; Thogerson et al. 1993; Friel et\nal. 2002) use each index individually to derive a metallicity for each star, then average the\nderived metallicities together. Our analysis indicates that several of the indices provide no\nadditional sensitivity to metallicity for the stars in our sample, and we do not use them at\nall.\nBelow we discuss the application of our fit to each target-cluster individually and compare the derived metallicity to existing values in the literature. Most of the open clusters\nstudied here do not have a large number of previous metallicity determinations.\nA new catalog of open clusters (Dias et al. 2002) improves upon and replaces the Lynga\n(1987) database and includes metallicity estimates for all of our target-clusters. Although\nthe on-line catalog does not include references for the metallicity estimates of the clusters,\nDias (2005, private communication) has provided the references used in the catalog. We cite\nthe references given to us by Dias for each of the clusters in the discussion below.\n\n4.2.1. NGC 1245\nNGC 1245 has a metallicity of [m/H]=\u22120.14\u00b10.04 derived from seven measurements\nof six stars. The scatter in the derived metallicities is 0.09 dex, close to what we expect\nbased on the error in the method. The identifiers used in Table 3 are taken from Chincarini\n(1964). The cluster has a well-defined red clump and all target-cluster stars were taken from\nthe clump. We observed seven of the 27 clump giants from out instrumental CMD of NGC\n1245. Unfortunately, WEBDA does not give membership probabilities for these stars.\nNGC 1245 is studied extensively by Burke et al. (2004) (hereafter referred to as Paper I);\nnew photometry is reported and fundamental properties of the cluster are derived, including\na new metallicity value based on color-magnitude diagram profile fitting. It was selected as\nthe first of several clusters for a targeted transiting planet search by the STEPSS program.\nPaper I reports a metallicity for NGC 1245 of [Fe/H]=\u22120.05\u00b1 0.03 (statistical) \u00b1 0.08\n(systematic). This value is derived from detailed isochrone fitting, using a \u03c72 fit to accurate\nphotometric observations to derive physical parameters of the cluster and quantifying the\nsystematic errors in the method. This method yields perhaps the most reliable derivation\nof cluster parameters of any of those referred to below, with the possible exception of the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy determinations.\nIt should be noted that in \u00a73.1 of Paper I a best-fit value of the total-to-selective extinction RV =2.3 is derived, yielding a metallicity of [Fe/H]=\u22120.26. This value was in fact\nnot used in the determination as it was assumed to be too low and the fiducial value of\nRV =3.2 is adopted. Our derived metallicity agrees equally well with both determinations\nof Paper I. The assumed total-to-selective extinction may often be a large source of error in\nthe determination of fundamental cluster parameters using isochrone fitting methods, since\nRV is not 3.2 uniformly throughout the Galaxy (see, e.g., Gould et al. 2001).\nWee & Lee (1996) also study the metallicity of NGC 1245 with Washington photometry. They derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]=\u22120.04\u00b10.05. Gratton (2000) cite a value of\n[Fe/H]=+0.1\u00b10.15, derived by applying corrections based on high-resolution spectroscopy\nto low-resolution metallicity determinations.\nThe metallicity of NGC 1245 derived here, [m/H]=\u22120.14\u00b10.04, is somewhat lower than\npreviously published metallicities for this cluster. In particular, our metallicity for NGC 1245\nreproduces the value cited in Paper I to only \u223c2 sigma. We agree with the Gratton (2000)\nmetallicity to 1.5 sigma and the Wee & Lee (1996) metallicity to 1.6 sigma.\n\n4.2.2. NGC 2099\nThe metallicity of NGC 2099 is [m/H]=+0.05\u00b10.05 and is derived from measurements\nof eight stars. The metallicity determinations of the target-cluster stars in NGC 2099 have\na scatter of 0.14 dex, about twice what we expect. Target-cluster names in Table 3 are\ntaken from van Zeipel & Lindgren (1921). We observed eight of the 23 clump giants in this\ncluster's instrumental CMD; all of the target-cluster giants in NGC 2099 are taken from the\nwell-populated clump. The observed stars all had membership probabilities of greater than\n75%, according to WEBDA.\nNGC 2099 is a relatively unstudied cluster with few metallicity measurements. It is\nalso the second cluster (after NGC 1245) to be observed by the STEPSS transiting planet\nsearch. Twarog et al. (1997) are some of the few to have studied NGC 2099. They use DDO\nphotometry to derive [Fe/H]=+0.089\u00b10.146. Our value of [m/H]=+0.05\u00b10.05 is consistent\nwith the metallicity cited by Twarog et al. (1997) to 0.2 sigma.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.3. NGC 2324\nWe derive a metallicity for NGC 2324 of [m/H]=\u22120.06\u00b10.04 from three measurements\nof four stars. The scatter in metallicity determinations among the stars observed in NGC\n2324, 0.07 dex, is close to the expected level given the error in the method. Identifiers for\nthese target-cluster stars are from Piatti et al. (2004). This cluster has a relatively welldefined clump; our target-cluster stars were selected from the seven giants in the clump.\nWEBDA reports very low membership probabilities for two of these stars; 0850 is given as\n35% and 1006 is 11%. The third star, 1552, does not have a membership probability reported\nin WEBDA. These numbers are surprising, since our results have low scatter and the stars\nfall within the region of the clump in the CMD.\nFriel et al. (2002) studied NGC 2324 with the spectrophotometric line index method used\nin this paper. They report a metallicity for NGC 2324 of [Fe/H]=\u22120.15\u00b10.16. Others have\nalso studied this cluster: Piatti et al. (2004) use their own reddening data with the Washington photometric data of Geisler et al. (1992) to derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]=\u22120.31\u00b10.04.\nGeisler et al. (1992) themselves derive [Fe/H]\u223c \u22121 for this cluster. Cameron (1985) uses UV\nexcess methods to derive [Fe/H]=-0.163.\nWe report [m/H]=\u22120.06\u00b10.04 for NGC 2324. Our derived metallicity is consistent with\nthe Friel et al. (2002) value to 0.5 sigma and with the Piatti et al. (2004) value to 4.4 sigma.\n\n4.2.4. NGC 2539\nThe metallicity of NGC 2539 is [m/H]=\u22120.04\u00b10.03, derived from four stars. The standard deviation of the metallicity estimates of the cluster stars observed in NGC 2539 is 0.05\ndex. We use the Lapasset et al. (2000) identifiers for the target-cluster stars in this cluster.\nOur instrumental CMD of NGC 2539 showed a small clump with only a few stars; we observed all four of these clump stars. WEBDA does not report membership probabilities for\nthis cluster, although due to the low scatter in metallicities we believe all of our target-cluster\nstars to in fact be members of the cluster.\nClari\u00e1 & Lapasset (1986) derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.2 from DDO data; they also\nderive a value of [Fe/H]=\u22120.2\u00b10.1 from iron lines. Twarog et al. (1997) publish an [Fe/H]\nof +0.137\u00b10.062 determined from DDO photometry.\nOur derived metallicity differs from that of Twarog et al. (1997) by 2.6 sigma. We agree\nwith the Clari\u00e1 & Lapasset (1986) metallicity derived from iron lines to 1.5 sigma.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n4.2.5. NGC 2682\nWe report a metallicity of [m/H]=\u22120.05\u00b10.02 for NGC 2682 from five measurements of\nfour cluster stars. The scatter is about half what we expect given the error in the method,\n0.04 dex. Fagerholm (1906) provides the identifications for the stars in this target-cluster.\nAll of our target-cluster stars have greater than 93% probabilities of being cluster members,\naccording to WEBDA. NGC 2682 has the most evolved giant branch of any of the targetclusters; in this cluster we selected four stars from the instrumental CMD that were located\nalong the giant branch.\nNGC 2682 (M67) is one of the oldest known open clusters in the Galaxy; it is also by\nfar the most-studied cluster in our sample, with many more metallicity determinations than\ndiscussed here. Previous studies agree that NGC 2682 has an approximately solar metallicity.\nCayrel de Strobel (1990) uses high-resolution spectroscopy to obtain a metallicity for NGC\n2682 of [Fe/H]=+0.039\u00b10.09. Hobbs & Thorburn (1991) use high-resolution spectroscopy\nof weak iron lines to find [Fe/H]=\u22120.04 \u00b1 0.12. Both Friel & Janes (1993) and Friel et\nal. (2002) derive the metallicity of this cluster from indices used in this paper; they obtain\nmetallicities of [Fe/H]=\u22120.09\u00b10.07 and [Fe/H]=\u22120.15\u00b10.05, respectively. Burstein et al.\n(1986) use a moderate resolution iron index to derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]=\u22120.1+0.12\n\u22120.04 .\nCameron (1985) uses the cluster's UV excess to derive [Fe/H]=\u22120.029. Twarog et al. (1997)\nuse DDO photometry to find [Fe/H]=+0.000\u00b10.092.\nOur derived metallicity for NGC 2682 agrees well with most metallicities given in the\nliterature. This metallicity agrees with Cayrel de Strobel (1990) to 0.96 sigma and with\nHobbs & Thorburn (1991) to 0.1 sigma. Our determination agrees with other metallicities\nderived from spectrophotometric line index methods as well: we reproduce the Friel & Janes\n(1993) value to 0.5 sigma and the Friel et al. (2002) value to 1.8 sigma. We agree with the\nlower error of Burstein et al. (1986) to 1.1 sigma; we agree with Twarog et al. (1997) to 0.5\nsigma.\n\n4.2.6. NGC 6705\nThe metallicity of NGC 6705 is [m/H]=+0.14\u00b10.08, derived from four stars. The stars\nhave a scatter of 0.16 dex. We use the identifiers of McNamara et al. (1977) for NGC 6705.\nThese stars all had membership probabilities in WEBDA of 98% or greater. This cluster\nhas a very sparse instrumental CMD; we observed four of the six giants in the well-defined\nclump.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nCameron (1985) also studied NGC 6705. For this cluster they derive [Fe/H]=+0.070\nwith UV excess methods. Twarog et al. (1997) give [Fe/H]=+0.136\u00b10.086, derived by shifting spectroscopic measurements made by Thogerson et al. (1993) onto a scale in common\nwith other literature values. Thogerson et al. (1993) derive [Fe/H]=+0.21\u00b10.09 using spectrophotometric line indices.\nWe derive a metallicity for NGC 6705 of [m/H]=+0.14\u00b10.08. This agrees very well with\nprevious estimates; it is within 0.03 sigma of the metallicity derived by Twarog et al. (1997),\nand agrees with Thogerson et al. (1993) to 0.6 sigma.\n\n4.2.7. NGC 6819\nNGC 6819 has a metallicity of [m/H]=+0.07\u00b10.12. This cluster has the largest scatter\nin metallicity determinations among cluster stars in our sample (0.24 dex). It is possible that\nsome of the stars in our sample are not in fact cluster members. Unfortunately, WEBDA\ndoes not report membership probabilities for any of our stars in NGC 6819. Furthermore, the\nfour stars selected in this cluster lie slightly below the giant branch of this evolved cluster.\nThis may also account for some of the scatter in the derived metallicities of these stars. The\nidentifiers for this target-cluster are taken from Auner (1974).\nNGC 6819 is another old open cluster that has been studied more than the younger\nclusters. The cluster's metallicity is derived in two papers using the index method: both\nFriel & Janes (1993) and Thogerson et al. (1993) derive [Fe/H]=+0.05\u00b10.11. Bragaglia et\nal. (2001) use high-resolution spectroscopy to measure metal lines in three red clump stars\nin NGC 6819; they derive a metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.09\u00b10.03. Twarog et al. (1997) give\n[Fe/H]=+0.074\u00b10.123, again obtained by shifting spectroscopic measurements made by Friel\n& Janes (1993) and Thogerson et al. (1993) onto a scale in common with other literature\nvalues.\nOur metallicity estimate for NGC 6819 is [m/H]=+0.07\u00b10.12, in excellent agreement\nwith existing literature values. We agree with Friel & Janes (1993) and Thogerson et al.\n(1993) to 0.12 sigma, with Twarog et al. (1997) to 0.02 sigma, and with Bragaglia et al.\n(2001) to 0.16 sigma.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have derived metallicity estimates for seven Galactic open clusters. We use moderateresolution spectroscopy to estimate metallicities of giants in these clusters, calibrating our\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nresults with high-resolution metallicity determinations of field giants. We reproduce the\nhigh-resolution determinations to 0.08 dex. Our derived metallicities generally agree with\nthose found in the literature; more importantly, we provide new metallicity estimates for\nseveral clusters that are not well studied.\nThis method is of interest because it requires little observing time, relatively small\ntelescopes, and the results are arrived at quickly compared to more complicated methods\n(such as those used in Paper I). This method is also more robust than many photometric\ntechniques, as it relies on quantitative spectroscopy and relative index measurements, not\non the generally unpredictable photometricity of the night sky. We have demonstrated that\nit reproduces the metallicities of calibration stars of known metallicity well. The measured\nindices are easily reproducible on different telescopes and even, as evidenced by comparison\nof our indices to the published indices of Friel (1987), by different instruments and observers.\nThe metallicity estimates given here will allow for selection of open clusters in which to\nconduct future transiting extra-solar planet searches.\nThe authors wish to thank W.
