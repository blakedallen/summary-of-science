We prove\nthat it is a q-deformation of the Weyl-Kac character formula. In particular this implies that the constant\nterm of the polynomial counting the number of absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver\nequals the multiplicity of a a certain weight in the corresponding Kac-Moody algebra, which was conjectured by Kac in 1982.\n\nLet \u0393 = (I, E) be a quiver that is an oriented graph on a finite set I = {1, . . . , n} with E \u2282 I \u00d7 I a finite\nmultiset of oriented (perhaps multiple but no loop) edges. Given two dimension vectors v = (vi ) \u2208 NI and\nw = (wi ) \u2208 NI Nakajima [13, 14] constructs, as holomorphic symplectic quotient, a complex variety M(v, w)\nof dimension 2dv,w , which we call a Nakajima quiver variety. In [15] Nakajima found a combinatorial\nalgorithm to determine the Betti numbers of these varieties.\nHere we prove and study the following generating function of Betti numbers of Nakajima quiver varieties.\n\u0010\n\u0011\nTheorem 1 Fix w \u2208 NI . Denote bi (M(v, w)) := dim H i (M(v, w)) .

It proceeds by counting points of M(v, w) over finite fields Fq using a Fourier transform\ntechnique, then showing that the mixed Hodge structure on H \u2217 (M(v, w)) is pure and concludes by applying Katz's result [6, Appendix, Theorem 6.2] connecting the arithmetic and the cohomology of so-called\npolynomial-count varieties.\nThe other theme of this paper is a combinatorial study of the formula (1). Using the main result of [14] we\nprove that the Weyl-Kac character formula is the q = 0 specialization of (1). We then interpret Hua's formula\n[7, Theorem 4.9] as a q-deformation of the Kac denominator formula for the denominator on the RHS of\n(1). This in particular implies for \u03b1 \u2208 NI that the constant term of Kac's A-polynomial counting absolutely\nindecomposable representations of a quiver of dimension \u03b1 over a finite field agrees with the multiplicity of\n\n1\n\n\f\u03b1 in the Kac-Moody algebra g(\u0393) associated to the quiver. This completes1 a proof of Kac's [10, Conjecture\n1]. This conjecture was known for finite and tame quivers [10], and for all quivers with \u03b1 indivisible [1] by\nstudy of similar quiver varieties, but was not fully known for any single wild quiver.\nAcknowledgment. I am grateful for Hiraku Nakajima for suggesting the possibility of the application of\n(1) for Kac's conjecture, for Fernando Rodriguez-Villegas for drawing my attention to Hua's work, for Nick\nProudfoot for introducing me to Kac's conjecture and an anonymous referee for useful comments.

Our proof is independent of [1] and gives a more general approach to calculate the Betti numbers of holomorphic\nsymplectic quotients of vector spaces by linear actions of reductive groups.\n\n2\n\n\fWe can think of an element v \u2208 V as a character v : b\nV \u2192 C\u00d7 given by v(\u03c7) := \u03c7(v), this way we can\nb\nidentify b\nV = V.

For \u03bb \u2208 K\u00d7 let \u03bb1v = (\u03bbIdV1 , . . . , \u03bbIdVn ) \u2208 gv . Further assume\nP\nP\nchar(K) \u2224 i=1 vi or equivalently 0K , 1K ( i=1 vi ). Then the equation \u03bcv,0 (v, w) = \u03bb1\u2217v has a solution if and\nonly if v = 0.\nProof. As w = 0 by (11) we have \u033av,0 (1v )(v) = 0. Now assume \u03bcv,0 (v, w) = \u03bb1\u2217v then by (12) we have\nX\n\u03bb\nvi = h\u03bcv,0 (v, w), 1v i = h\u033av,0 (1v )v, wi = 0,\ni\u2208I\n\nthus char(K) |\n\nP\n\ni\u2208I\n\nvi . \u0003\n\nProposition 4 Let w, v \u2208 NI arbitrary and char(K) = 0 or char(K) >\n\u03bcv,w (v, w) = \u03bb1\u2217v\n\nP\n\ni\u2208I\n\nvi . For \u03bb \u2208 K\u00d7 , and a solution\n(14)\n\nassume that for a x \u2208 gv\n\u033av,w (x)(v, w) = 0\nthen x = 0.\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fProof. Let Vi\u2032 := im(xi ) \u2264 Vi with dimension v\u2032i . As \u033av,w (x)(v, w) = 0 we have that Ji xi = 0 for all i \u2208 I and\nso Ji is zero on Vi\u2032 \u2264 Vi . On the other hand we also have that xt(e) Ae \u2212 Ae xs(e) = 0 which implies that Ae maps\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nV s(e)\n\u2264 V s(e) to Vt(e)\n\u2264 Vt(e) and similarly Be maps Vt(e)\n\u2264 Vt(e) to V s(e)\n\u2264 V s(e) . Finally \u03bb1\u2217v restricts to \u03bb1\u2217v\u2032 . Thus\na solution of (14) reduces to a solution of \u03bcv\u2032 ,0 (v\u2032 , w\u2032 ) = \u03bb1\u2217v\u2032 . By our assumption on the characteristic of K\nP\nand Lemma 3 we have that i\u2208I v\u2032i = 0 or equivalently x = 0. \u0003\nP\nCorollary 5 Let w, v \u2208 NI arbitrary and char(K) = 0 or char(K) > i\u2208I vi . Assume that a solution of (14) is\ninvariant under g \u2208 Gv , then g = 1v .\nProof. We have \u03c1v,w (g)(v, w) = (v, w) and so g \u2212 1v \u2208 gv satisfies \u033av,w (g \u2212 1v )(v, w) = 0 thus Proposition 4\nimplies g = 1v . \u0003\nP\nCorollary 6 Let w, v \u2208 NI arbitrary and either char(K) = 0 or char(K) > i\u2208I vi . Then the derivative\nT (v,w) \u03bcv,w : T (v,w) Mv,w \u2192 T \u03bcv,w (v,w) g\u2217v\n\n(16)\n\nis surjective if and only \u033av,w (x)(v, w) = 0 implies x = 0. In particular at a solution (v, w) of (14) the derivative\n(16) is surjective.\nProof. The map T (v,w) \u03bcv,w is not surjective if and only if there exists 0 , x \u2208 gv such that for all Y \u2208 T (v,w) Mv,w\n0 = T (v,w) \u03bcv,w (Y) f x = Y(\u03bcv,w \u25e6 f x ) = d f x (Y) = \u03c9(\u033a(x)(v, w), Y),\nwhich holds when \u033av,w (x)(v, w) = 0, \u03c9 being non-degenerate. Here f x is the function defined in (6) while the\nlast equation follows from the moment map property (7). This proves the first statement.\nThe second statement follows from the first and Proposition 4. \u0003\nNow we assume K is algebraically closed and either char(K) = 0 or\nX\nchar(K) >\nvi .\n\n(17)\n\ni\u2208I\n\nFor \u03bb \u2208 K we take \u03bb1v = (\u03bbIdV1 , . . . , \u03bbIdVn ) \u2208 (g\u2217v )Gv , and define the affine variety\nV\u03bb (v, w) = \u03bc\u22121\nv,w (\u03bb1v ).\nFor l \u2208 Z we define the character \u03c7l : Gv \u2192 K\u00d7 by \u03c7l (g) = \u03a0i\u2208I det(gi )l . With these we can define\nn\no\nl\nK [V\u03bb (v, w)]Gv ,\u03c7 := f \u2208 K [V\u03bb (v, w)] | f (g(x)) = \u03c7l (g) f (x) for all x \u2208 V\u03bb (v, w) ,\nL\nln\nK [V\u03bb (v, w)]Gv ,\u03c7 becomes an N-graded algebra and so we can define the Nakajima quiver variety\nso\nn\u2208N\n[14] as the GIT quotient:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ecM\nln \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nG\n,\u03c7\nMl,\u03bb (v, w) = Proj \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nK [V\u03bb (v, w)] v \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\nn\u2208N\n\nFor now we note that as an affine GIT quotient\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nM0,\u03bb (v, w) = Spec K [V\u03bb (v, w)]Gv = V\u03bb (v, w)//Gv\n\nis an affine variety. Exactly as in [14, Corollary 3.12] we get that M1,\u03bb (v, w) is non-singular of dimension\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ecX\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n2dv,w = 2 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed v s(e) vt(e) +\nvi (wi \u2212 vi )\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n(18)\ne\u2208E\n\ni\u2208I\n\nfor all \u03bb. We also have\n\nLemma 7 For \u03bb , 0 the variety M0,\u03bb (v, w) is non-singular of dimension 2dv,w and hence M1,\u03bb \u001b M0,\u03bb .\n6\n\n\fProof. First we note that by Corollary 6 at a solution of (14) the derivative (16) surjective. This shows\n\u2217\nthat V\u03bb (v, w) = \u03bc\u22121\nv,w (\u03bb1v ) is non-singular of dimension dim(Mv,w ) \u2212 dim(gv ). Now by Corollary 5 the action\nof Gv on V\u03bb (v, w) is free, and therefore the quotient M0,\u03bb = V\u03bb (v, w)//Gv is non-singular of dimension\ndim(V\u03bb (v, w)) \u2212 dim(Gv ) = 2dv,w .\nFinally by the GIT construction we have the map M1,\u03bb (v, w) \u2192 M0,\u03bb , which is proper and a resolution of\nsingularities. Consequently it is an isomorphism. \u0003\nTheorem 8 When K = C the mixed Hodge structure on the isomorphic cohomologies H \u2217 (M1,0 (v, w)) \u001b\nH \u2217 (M0,1 (v, w)) is pure.\nProof. The proof is similar to [5, Proposition 2.2.6]. We define the map \u03bc : Mv,w \u00d7 C \u2192 g\u2217v by\n\u03bc(v, w, z) = \u03bcv,w (v, w) \u2212 z1\u2217v .\nWe then take V := \u03bc\u22121 0 and define:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ecM\nn\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nG\n,\u03c7\nM1 := Proj \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nC [V] v \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nn\u2208N\n\nwhere we extended the Gv action trivially over C. The forgetful map f (v, w, z) = z induces a map f : M1 \u2192 C.\nNow, similarly to [14, Corollary 3.12], one can prove that M1 is non-singular. Also f is a submersion as\n\u2202z \u03bc = 1v . Finally we have the C\u00d7 -action\n\u03bb(v, w, z) = (\u03bbv, \u03bbw, \u03bb2z)\n\n(19)\n\ndescending to a C\u00d7 -action on M1 . We have the natural C\u00d7 -equivariant proper map M1 \u2192 M0 where M0 :\nSpec[V]Gv is the affine GIT quotient, with the C\u00d7 -action given by (19). It is clear that the fixed point set\n\u00d7\n(Mv,w \u00d7 C)C = {0} consists of the origin, and also that every C\u00d7 -orbit on Mv,w \u00d7 C will have the origin 0 in\nits closure. It follows that the C\u00d7 action on M0 will have a single fixed point - the image of 0 by the quotient\n\u00d7\nmap- and all C\u00d7 -orbits on M0 will have this single fixed point 0 in their closure. It follows that MC1 is proper\nand for any x \u2208 M1 the lim\u03bb\u21920 z\u03bb exists. The statement now follows from [5, Appendix B]. \u0003\nNow we can determine the Betti numbers of quiver varieties.\nProof of Theorem 1. The strategy of the proof is the following (cf. [6, \u00a72.1, Appendix], [5, \u00a72.5]). First we\nconstruct a spreading out of M0,1 (v, w)/C. In other words we construct a scheme Y over a finitely generated\nZ-algebra R together with a homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 C, such that the extension of scalars gives Y\u03c6 \u001b\nM0,1 (v, w)/C. Then for any homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 Fq to finite fields we will use Proposition 2 to count the\nnumber of rational points Y\u03c6 (Fq ) and find it is a polynomial E(q) in q. Then Katz's [6, Theorem 6.1.2.3] will\nimply that the so-called E-polynomial satisfies E(M0,1 (v, w); x, y) = E(xy). Combining Theorem 8 and [5,\nProposition 2.5.2] we can deduce that\nX\nE(q) =\nb2i (M0,1 (v, w)/C)qdv,w \u2212i ,\ni\n\nwhich will yield Theorem 1.\nP\n1\nSo let D = vi and let R := Z[ D!\n]. The choice of R will ensure that there is a homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 K\nif and only if char(K) satisfies (17). We can now construct everything Mv,w (R) Gv (R) and g\u2217v (R) over R, so\nthat we will have \u03bcv,w : Mv,w (R) \u2192 g\u2217v (R). The easiest is to think in terms of the explicit form (13) for \u03bcv,w .\nLet X be the closed affine subscheme of Mv,w (R) given by the equations \u03bcv,w (v, w) = 1v . This is clearly a\n7\n\n\fspreading out of V1 (v, w)/C. We can now define Y = Spec(R[X]Gv (R) ). As the natural map \u03c6 : R \u2192 C is a\nflat morphism [16, Lemma 2] implies that Y is indeed a spreading out of M0,1 (v, w)/C. Now if \u03c6 : R \u2192 Fq a\nhomomorphism then by Corollary 5 Gv (Fq ) acts freely on V1 (v, w)(Fq ) so we have (cf. [6, proof of Theorem\n3.5.1]) that\n|V1 (v, w)(Fq )|\n.\n|Y\u03c6 (Fq )| =\n|Gv (Fq )|\nFor w \u2208 I N we will determine the grand generating function\n\u03a6(w) =\n\nX X a\u033av,w (x)\u03a8(trv (x))\nX X a\u033av,w (x)\u03a8(trv (x))\nX |V1 (v, w)(Fq )| |gv |\nXv =\nXv =\nXv .\n|G\n(F\n)|\n|V\n|\n|G\n(F\n)|\n|C\n|\nv\nq\nv,w\nv\nq\nx\nN x\u2208g\nN [x]\u2208g /G\nN\nv\u2208I\n\nv\u2208I\n\nv\u2208I\n\nv\n\nv\n\n(20)\n\nv\n\nHere we first applied our main Proposition 2 to get\n\u22121\n\n|V1 (v, w)(Fq )| = |gv | |Vv,w |\n\nX\n\na\u033av,w (x)\u03a8(hx, 1\u2217v i),\n\nx\u2208gv\n\nand then rewrote the sum over gv /Gv the set of Gv orbits on gv with C x \u2282 Gv standing for the centralizer of x.\nWe also used the notation\nX v = \u03a0i\u2208I Xivi .\n\n(21)\n\nTo understand now (20) we should recall some basic linear algebraic facts for the collection x = (xi )i\u2208I of\nreg\nlinear endomorphisms. Any linear endomorphism xi \u2208 gl(Vi ) decomposes as xnil\non the decomposition\ni \u2295 xi\nreg\nvi\nvi\nVi = N(xi ) \u2295 R(xi ), where N(xi ) = ker(xi ) and R(xi ) = im(xi ). By construction xi will be a non-singular\ntransformation on R(xi ), while xnil\ni will be nilpotent on N(xi ). Similarly to [2, Lemma 1] it is straightforward to\ncheck that if \u03c6 \u2208 ker(\u033av,w (x)) \u2282 Vv,w then \u03c6 preserves the decomposition Vi = N(xi ) \u2295 R(xi ) and Wi = Wi \u2295 0.\nConsequently, we have a\u033av,w (x) = a\u033avnil ,w (xnil )a\u033avreg ,0 (xreg ), similarly \u03a8(trv (x)) = \u03a8(trvnil (xnil ))\u03a8(trvreg (xreg )) =\n\u03a8(trvreg (xreg )) as trvnil (xnil ) = 0, and clearly |C x | = |C xnil ||C xreg |. Finally observe that if x = xnil is nilpotent\n\u03a8(trv (x)) = 1.\nNow we can factor (20) as\n\u03a6(w) = \u03a6nil (w)\u03a6reg .\n\n(22)\n\nHere we used, for a dimension vector w \u2208 I N , the generating functions\n\u03a6nil (w) =\n\nX\n\nX\n\nv\u2208I N [x]\u2208(gv /Gv )nil\n\nand\n\u03a6reg =\n\nX\n\nX\n\nv\u2208I N [x]\u2208(gv /Gv )reg\n\na\u033av,w (x) v\nX\n|C x |\n\na\u033av,0 (x)\u03a8(trv (x)) v\nX .\n|C x |\n\nFinally we note, that when w = 0 Lemma 3 implies that \u03a6(0) = 1 and so (22) yields \u03a6reg =\nthe result\n\u03a6(w) =\n\n\u03a6nil (w)\n.\n\u03a6nil (0)\n\n1\n,\n\u03a6nil (0)\n\ngiving\n\n(23)\n\nWe are left with understanding \u03a6nil (w), which reduces to some explicit formulae for which we will need some\nnew notation.\nLet V1 and V2 be finite dimensional Fq vector spaces of dimension v1 and v2 respectively. Let \u03bbi =\n(\u03bbi1 , \u03bbi2 , . . . ) be a partition of vi , i.e. vi = \u03bbi1 + \u03bbi2 + . . . and \u03bbi1 \u2265 \u03bbi2 \u2265 . . . are positive integers. Let xi \u2208 gl(Vi )\n8\n\n\fbe a nilpotent endomorphism of type \u03bbi , in other words a nilpotent endomorphism with Jordan normal form\nconsisting of nilpotent Jordan blocks of size \u03bbij . If C xi = {g \u2208 GL(Vi )|gxi = xi g} denotes the centralizer of xi\nthen it follows from [7, Theorem 3.4]\n|C xi | = q\n\nh\u03bbi ,\u03bbi i\n\ni\nk (\u03bb )\nY mY\n(1 \u2212 q\u2212 j ),\n\nk\n\nj=1\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere mk (\u03bbi ) is the multiplicity of the part k in the partition \u03bbi , i.e. \u03bbi = (1m1 (\u03bb ) , 2m2 (\u03bb ) , . . . ) in the mul1\n1\ntiplicity notation of partitions. Furthermore for any two partitions \u03bb1 = (1m1 (\u03bb ) , 2m2 (\u03bb ) , . . . )) and \u03bb2 =\n2\n2\n(1m1 (\u03bb ) , 2m2 (\u03bb ) , . . . )) we use the notation\nX\nh\u03bb1 , \u03bb2i =\nmin(i, j)mi(\u03bb1 )m j (\u03bb2 ).\n(24)\ni, j\n\nThen it follows from [7, Lemma 3.3] that\n1\n\n2\n\n|{A \u2208 Hom(V1 , V2 )|AX1 = X2 A}| = qh\u03bb ,\u03bb i .\nIn particular when \u03bb2 = (1v2 ) i.e. X2 = 0, we get\n1\n\nv2\n\n|{A \u2208 Hom(V1 , V2 )|AX1 = 0}| = qh\u03bb ,1 i .\nThese results put together lead to the required combinatorial formula:\n\u0010Q\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\nh\u03bbs(e) ,\u03bbt(e) i Q\nh\u03bbi ,1wi i\nX\ne\u2208E q\ni\u2208I q\n\u0011 X |\u03bb| .\n\u03a6nil (w) =\nQ \u0010 h\u03bbi ,\u03bbi i Q Qmk (\u03bbi )\n\u2212\nj\nk\ni\u2208I q\n\u03bb\u2208PI\nj=1 (1 \u2212 q )\n\nVia (23) we obtain a formula for the generating function for |V1 (v, w)(Fq )|. This shows that |V1 (v, w)(Fq )| is\na rational function in q, but as it is an integer for any prime power q (satisfying (17)) it has to be a polynomial\nin q. Therefore Katz's [6, Theorem 6.1.2.3] applies and yields Theorem 2. \u0003\n\n3 Solution of Kac's conjecture\nA representation of \u0393 over a field K is a collection of finite dimensional K-vector spaces {Vi }i\u2208I and linear maps\n{\u03c6e }e\u2208E such that \u03c6e \u2208 HomK (V s(e) , Vt(e) ). The dimension vector \u03b1 \u2208 NI encodes the dimensions \u03b1i = dimK (Vi ).\nThe building blocks of representations of \u0393 are the indecomposable ones, that is ones that cannot be written\nas a non-trivial direct sum of two representations. Kac proved in [9, Theorems 1,2] that there exists an\nindecomposable representation of \u0393 of dimension vector \u03b1 if and only if \u03b1 is a root of a certain Kac-Moody\nLie algebra g(\u0393) associated to \u0393.\nWhen the field K is not algebraically closed, like the finite fields Fq we will focus in this paper, then\nit is natural to study absolutely indecomposable representations of \u0393, that is ones that are indecomposable\nover the algebraic closure K. Kac in [10] introduced the number A\u0393 (\u03b1, q) of indecomposable representations\nof \u0393 over the finite field K = Fq of dimension vector \u03b1. He proved [10, Proposition 1.5] that A\u0393 (\u03b1, q) is a\npolynomial in q with integer coefficients. He went on to conjecture [10, Conjecture 1] that the constant term\nof this polynomial A\u0393 (\u03b1, q) captures more information on the associated Kac-Moody Lie algebra:\nConjecture 1 (Kac) The constant term\nA\u0393 (\u03b1, 0) = m\u03b1\nequals the multiplicity of the weight \u03b1 in g(\u0393).\n9\n\n\fThe Kac-Moody algebra [8] is constructed from the Cartan matrix of the quiver as an analouge of a\nsimply-laced simple Lie algebra, which arise from the ADE Dynkin diagrams. Instead of giving details of\nthat construction we give a combinatorial definition of the numbers m\u03b1 . Let (\u03b1i )i\u2208I be the standard basis of ZI .\nb\nDefine a bilinear pairing on ZI by setting (\u03b1i , \u03b1 j ) = \u03b4i j \u2212 2i j , where bi j is the number of edges of \u0393 between i\nand j. One defines the reflections ri : ZI \u2192 ZI by ri (\u03bb) = \u03bb \u2212 2(\u03bb, \u03b1i )\u03b1i . The subgroup W = h(ri )i\u2208I i \u2282 Aut(ZI )\ngenerated by these reflections is the Weyl group. Extend now the action of W to the lattice ZI \u2295 Z\u03c1 by\nP\nri (\u03c1) = \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b1i . For any w \u2208 W we have \u03c1 \u2212 w(\u03c1) \u2208 NI \\ {0}. So if for an \u03b1 = i ki \u03b1i \u2208 ZI we write\nQ\nX \u03b1 = i\u2208I Xiki then we can write the product expansion of the following sum\nX\nY\ndet(w)X \u03c1\u2212w(\u03c1) =\n(1 \u2212 X \u03b1 )m\u03b1 ,\n(25)\nw\u2208W\n\n\u03b1\u2208NV\n\ndefining the integers m\u03b1 . When m\u03b1 is defined through the usual route as the multiplicity of the weight \u03b1 in\ng(\u0393), (25) is called the Kac denominator formula.\nThere is a similar generating formula encoding the coefficients of the A-polynomial due to Hua [7]. If\nP\nA\u0393 (\u03b1, q) = j t\u03b1j q j then we have [7, Theorem 4.9]\n\nTheorem 9 (Hua) If for a collection of partitions \u03bb = (\u03bbi )i\u2208I \u2208 PI we denote the vector |\u03bb| = (|\u03bbi |)i\u2208I \u2208 NI of\nthe sizes of the partitions, then\nQ\n\u221e Y\n\u221e\nh\u03bbs(e) ,\u03bbt(e) i\nX\nYY\n\u03b1\ne\u2208E q\n|\u03bb|\n\u0011X =\n(1 \u2212 qi+ j X \u03b1 )t j\n(26)\nQ \u0010 h\u03bbi ,\u03bbi i Q Qmk (\u03bbi )\n\u2212 j)\nq\n(1\n\u2212\nq\nI\nI\ni=0\nj=0\nk\ni\u2208I\n\u03bb\u2208P\n\u03b1\u2208N\nj=1\n\nAs Hua points out in [7][Corollary 4.10] if one could show that the q = 0 evaluation of the combinatorially\ndefined LHS of (26) would agree with the combinatorially defined LHS of (25) then one would have that\nXY\nY\n\u03b1\n(1 \u2212 X \u03b1 )m\u03b1 =\n(1 \u2212 X \u03b1 )t0\n(27)\n\u03bb\u2208PI \u03b1\u2208NV\n\n\u03b1\u2208NI\n\nthe q = 0 evaluation of the RHS of (26) agrees with the RHS of (25). In turn, by comparing coefficients, (27)\nimplies Kac's Conjecture 1 that m\u03b1 = t0\u03b1 . However the combinatorial expressions on the RHS of (25) and\n(26) are difficult to evaluate in practice [17, 11].\nIn this paper we take an alternative route to prove (27) and thus Conjecture 1 by relating the RHS of (25)\nand (26) to the denominator of the Weyl-Kac character formula. Recall the notation from [14, \u00a72]. Thus\nP denotes a finitely generated free Z-module, the weight lattice. Let P\u2217 = HomZ (P, Z) with natural pairing\nh, i : P \u00d7 P\u2217 \u2192 Z. Now \u03b1i \u2208 P (i=1..n) are the linearly independent simple roots. Let Q = ZI = Z[\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ]\nbe the root lattice, we have encountered above. Have a symmetric bilinear form (, ) on P such that the coroots\nb\nhi \u2208 P\u2217 given by hhi , \u03bbi = (\u03b1k , \u03bb) satisfy that hhi , \u03b1 j i = \u03b4i j \u2212 2i j . Thus the root lattice Q = ZI will inherit the\npairing we already introduced above. Finally we pick \u039bi \u2208 P for i = 1, . . . , n such that hh j , \u039bi i = \u03b4i j . For\nP\nw \u2208 NI we introduce \u039bw = i wi \u039bi . Finally we can define reflections ri : P \u2192 P given by ri (\u03bb) = \u03bb\u2212(\u03bb, \u03b1i )\u03b1i ,\nwhich then generate the Weyl group W. It is clear that the root lattice Q is left invariant and the induced action\nP\nof W is the one we encountered above. Note also that \u039b1 = i \u039bi plays the role of \u03c1 introduced above.\nNow the Weyl-Kac character formula [8, Theorem 10.4] says the following:\nTheorem 10 (Kac) Let L(\u039b) be an irreducible representation of g(\u0393) of highest weight \u039b \u2208 P. Let L(\u039b) =\n\u2295\u03b1\u2208NI L(\u039b)\u039b\u2212\u03b1 denote its weight space decomposition. Then\nX\ndet(w)X \u039b+\u03c1\u2212w(\u039b+\u03c1)\nX\nw\u2208W\ndim (L(\u039b)\u039b\u2212\u03b1 ) X \u03b1 = X\n(28)\n\u03c1\u2212w(\u03c1)\ndet(w)X\nI\n\u03b1\u2208N\nw\u2208W\n\n10\n\n\fNakajima in [14] gives a geometrical interpretation of the irreducible representation L(\u039b), and in turn to\nthe LHS of (28) using his quiver varieties. In the special case of x = 0 [14, Theorem 10.2] implies:\nTheorem 11 (Nakajima) Fix w \u2208 NI then\nX\nX\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\ndim H 2dv,w (M(v, w) X v =\ndim L(\u039bw )\u039bw \u2212\u03b1 X \u03b1\nv\u2208NI\n\n(29)\n\n\u03b1\u2208NI\n\nWe notice that the denominator of the RHS of (1) agrees with the LHS of Hua's (26). On the other hand\nby Theorem 1 and Nakajima's (29) we have\n(LHS of (1))q=0 = LHS of (29) = LHS of (28),\n\n(30)\n\nfor every \u039bw = \u039b. For m \u2208 N take in particular w = m1 then \u039bm1 = m\u03c1. Then by applying the Kac\ndenominator formula (25) for both the numerator and the denominator we get\nX\ndet(w)X (m+1)\u03c1\u2212w((m+1)\u03c1) Q\n(m+1)\u03b1 m\u03b1\nY\n)\nw\u2208W\n\u03b1\u2208NV (1 \u2212 X\nX\n= Q\n=\n(1 + X \u03b1 + * * * + X m\u03b1 )m\u03b1 .\n(RHS of (28))\u039b=m\u03c1 =\n\u03b1 )m\u03b1\n\u03c1\u2212w(\u03c1)\n(1\n\u2212\nX\nV\n\u03b1\u2208N\ndet(w)X\n\u03b1\u2208NV\nw\u2208W\n\nThus when we take the limit m \u2192 \u221e we get\n\u0011\n\u0010\nlim (RHS of (28))\u039b=m\u03c1 = Q\n\n1\n.\n\u03b1 m\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208NV (1 \u2212 X )\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n(31)\n\nBecause for a partition \u03bbi of n > 0 we have h\u03bbi , 1m i \u2265 m and so in the m \u2192 \u221e limit the numerator of the RHS\nof (1) tends to 1 therefore\nlim ((RHS of (1))w=m1 ) =\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nQ\n\nX\n\n1\ns(e)\n\nt(e)\n\nqh\u03bb ,\u03bb i\n\u0010\n\u0011 X |\u03bb|\nQ\ni ,\u03bbi i Q Qmk (\u03bbi )\nh\u03bb\n\u2212\nj\nk\ni\u2208I q\n\u03bb\u2208PI\nj=1 (1 \u2212 q )\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\ne\u2208E\n\nNow the combination of (32), (26), (30), (28), (31) yields (27), which, as explained there, implies Conjecture 1.\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1] W.
