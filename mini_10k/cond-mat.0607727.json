Also\nobserved is a Berry phase of \u03c0 2,3,6 which increases to\n2\u03c0 in bilayers8. These spectacular dc properties can be\ntraced to the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene\nwhich are massless Dirac fermions governed by 2 + 1\ndimensional quantum electrodynamics9,10 .\nOptical\nconductivity measurements play a central role in solid\nstate physics and have provided additional information\non the dynamics of charge carriers and its change\nunder external perturbations, not directly available in\ndc measurements. Here we present a theory of the\ndiagonal optical conductivity of Dirac quasiparticles in\nan external magnetic field and highlight several unusual\nfeatures, not present in a conventional two dimensional\nelectron gas, which bear directly on their unconventional\ndynamics. We also investigate an emerging new physics\nof graphene related to the sublattice symmetry breaking\nreported in Ref.4 .\nIn the presence of a magnetic field, Landau levels (LLs)\nform in the electronic density of states and transitions\nbetween these levels give rise to absorption lines in the\noptical conductivity. In this letter we find that the selection rules, which set the frequencies of the lines and\ntheir relative spectral weight, provide a distinct signature\nof the presence of the Dirac quasiparticles. Not only do\nthe positions\n\u221a and the intensities of the absorption lines\nscale with B rather than B, but the line corresponding\nto the transition from the lowest, n = 0 to the n = 1\n(Landau level) LL is anomalous due to the special Dirac\ncharacter of the n = 0 level. This level and no others can\nparticipate in both inter and intraband transitions. As\na consequence, the first absorption line always appears\nwith full intensity or is entirely missing, while all other\nlines can also be seen to have in addition half intensity\ndepending on the position of chemical potential \u03bc relative\nto the LL energies. The chemical potential \u03bc is tunable\n\nin experiments by application of a gate bias voltage to a\nfield effect device1,2,3,4 .\nExpressions for the absorptive part of the diagonal as\nwell as Hall conductivity on which our calculations are\nbased can be found in7,11,12 .

To include damping, the\nn'th delta function in Eq. (1) is replaced by a Lorentzian\nof width \u0393n + \u0393n+1 with \u0393n the width of n'th level. Also\nin Eq.

The field B is applied perpendicular to\nthe plane and for B = 1 T the energy scale M1 \u2248 420 K\nfor vF \u2248 106 m/s and \u2206 = 0. As for the conventional\ncase, the selection rules allow transitions only between\nadjacent LLs (see Ref.11 for details).\nOur numerical results for Re \u03c3xx (\u03a9) are given in\nFig. 1 (a), where it is plotted in units e2 /h as a function\nof \u03a9 for \u2206 = 0. The same constant electronic scattering rate \u0393 = 15K4 was used for all LLs, an assumption\nthat could easily be relaxed. Except for the long dashed\n(red) curve for which the magnetic field B = 10\u22124 T, and\nis shown only for comparison, B = 1T for other curves.\nThey differ only in value of chemical potential \u03bc.

As \u03bc is increased to cross the n = 1 LL [solid (blue) curve], the first\npeak in the dash-dotted (black) curve disappears and the\nintensity of the next higher peak drops to half its value,\nwhile all other peaks remain the same. In addition, a\nnew intraband peak appears at M2 \u2212 M1 and its intensity picks up the lost optical spectral weight from the\nmissing and/or reduced interband transitions. Comparing with the short-dashed (green) curve, the first two interband lines have disappeared, the third has halved and\nthe intraband transition is at M3 \u2212 M2 . The first line of\nthe interband series is different in that it never appears\nwith half intensity, while the others do. It is the only\none which can be considered as involving both interband\nand intraband transitions as can be seen in Fig. 1 (b).\nThe energy level schematic shown in this figure summarizes our results. It shows how the first interband line on\nthe far left appears alone, while all others come in pairs.\nThis transition exists only for values of the chemical potential less than M1 , while the others first drop to half\nintensity as another LL is crossed before disappearing\nat the next crossing.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2.

This arrangement guarantees that\nthe various interband\np lines will all fall at the same normalized value of \u03a9/ 2~eBvF2 /c and the intensity of the\nvarious lines follow the same pattern as in Fig. 1.\nTo understand the intensity that is to be assigned to\nthe various lines and their changes with \u03bc it is sufficient\nto take the limit T \u2192 0 in Eq. (1). For chemical potential\n\u03bc \u2208 [MN , MN +1 ] we find (\u03a9 > 0)\n\n\u039c=150K\n\nD=200K\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n\nRe \u03c3xx (\u03a9) =\n\nwhere the first and second terms give the interband and\nintraband transitions, respectively, at the energies indicated by the \u03b4-functions. The denominators come from\nthe 1/\u03a9 factor \u221ain Eq. (1). In units of (e2 /h)M1 (\u03c0/2)\nwhich goes like B, the optical spectral weight of various\nlines is given by the quantities multiplying \u03b4-functions in\nEq. (2). For N > 0 all interband lines below n = N are\nmissing\n\u221a and the\n\u221a intensity of the line at n = N is half of\n2/( n + 1 + n). The total optical spectral weight lost\nis\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n1\n1\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a = \u221a\n\u221a .\n\u221a +\u221a\nn+1+ n\nN +1+ N\nN +1\u2212 N\nn=0\n(3)\nThe right hand side is exactly the intensity of the corresponding intraband line given by the second term in (2).\nWe verified that the integrated optical spectral weight\nunder Re \u03c3xx (\u03a9) up to energy \u03a9max is linear in \u03a9max and\napproximately equal to (e2 /h)(\u03c0/2)\u03a9max provided \u03a9max\nis taken large enough for many LLs to be involved. This\nlinear in \u03a9max behavior which holds as well for B = 0 is\nanother signature of the existence of the Dirac cones. In\nordinary metals for B = 0 the optical sum would rapidly\nsaturate to a constant value as \u03a9max is increased beyond\nthe scattering rate \u0393. The above rules for the intensity\nas well as the peculiar behavior of the first inter- (intra) band line as \u03bc is increased from zero are specific to\ngraphene and as yet have not been verified experimentally, although some data exist as we now describe. The\nearly magneto-reflectance data16 in fields of order of 1\nto 10 T in graphite assigned LL lines to the H-point in\nthe Brillouin zone. Some of these have central frequencies which vary as the square root17 of B as expected in\ngraphene. More recent data by Li et al.19 who use high\nfields up to 20 T, show conventional linear in B behavior. However, very recently, infrared transmission data18\non ultrathin epitaxial graphite samples20 in fields up\u221ato\n4 T have become available and provide Re \u03c3xx (\u03a9).

Long dashed (red) \u2206 = 0K, dash-dotted (black)\n\u2206 = 100K, solid (blue) \u2206 = 150K, short dashed (green)\n\u2206 = 200K. (b) Possible optical transitions between LLs with\nan excitonic gap \u2206. Two pairs of cones at K and K\u2032 points in\nthe Brillouin zone are drawn. Only LLs with n = 0 with energies \u2212\u2206 (at K point) and \u2206 (at K\u2032 point), and n = 1 with\nenergies \u00b1M1 , respectively, are shown. Three values of chemical potential are considered |\u03bc| < \u2206 (green), \u03bc = \u2206 (blue)\nand |\u03bc| > \u2206 (black). For the case \u03bc = \u2206 the state at energy\nE0 = \u2206 is both occupied and unoccupied with probability\n1/2.\n\nscaling for both the energy and the intensity of the first\nline was taken as evidence for Dirac quasiparticles. In\nview of the known sensitivity of some properties to coupling between layers it is not obvious that the various\ncarbon sheets in the samples are sufficiently decoupled to\nbe treated as isolated graphene sheets17 . Further, to understand the results it is necessary to assume that there is\na variation in charging, i.e. each sheet can have different\nchemical potential. We have analyzed the intensities of\nthe one intraband and of the three interband transitions\nreported in18 . The intensity of the first interband line (B)\nin Fig. 1 of Ref.18 , which can occur only for |\u03bc| < M1 , is\n\n\f4\nthe largest and that of the intraband line (A) is smaller\nby a factor of 0.36. This can only be understood if there\nare at least three times more sheets for which the chemical potential falls below M1 than above. Further, the\nratio of the intensity of the second (C) and the third (D)\ninterband lines to the first (B) are 0.34 and 0.19, respectively. These values are somewhat smaller than 0.41 and\n0.32 expected from our theory, coming from the sheets\nwith |\u03bc| < M1 . Adding in the other sheets with |\u03bc| > M1\nonly increase the above discrepancy, because they add to\nthe second and third interband lines, but not to the first.\nWhile the above provides some indirect support of our\ntheory, further experiments are needed to verify the main\nfeatures described here. A case for further studies is a\nbilayer21 where it is known8 that the two lowest LLs both\nlie at zero energy and this should change the pattern of\nbehavior of the absorption lines described here.\nThe ac conductivity may also be used to get information on the opening of a possible gap related to the sublattice symmetry breaking in graphene4,13,14,22,23,24 . In\nFig. 3 (a) we show results for Re \u03c3xx (\u03a9) plotted using the\ngeneralization of Eq. (1) to finite \u0393. Four values of the excitonic gap \u2206 are considered. For \u2206 < |\u03bc| the single peak\nat 294 cm\u22121 has split into two of nearly equal intensity,\nfor |\u03bc| = \u2206 the lower peak has approximately 1/3 the intensity of the upper peak and for \u2206 > |\u03bc| a single peak is\nseen at the higher energy. Fig. 3 (b) gives a schematic of\nthe levels involved and shows the transitions. For convenience we have fixed the gap in the figure and considered\nthree values of chemical potential. For |\u03bc| < \u2206 the interband transition \u2212M0 to M1 (LHS cone) and \u2212M1 to M0\n(RHS cone) are both possible and have the same energy\nM1 + \u2206, so only one line is seen shifted to higher energy.\nFor |\u03bc| = \u2206 one needs to account for the fact that the\nstate at n = 0 (RHS cone) is occupied (unoccupied) with\nprobability 1/2. The possible interband transitions are\n\u2212M0 to M1 (LHS cone) with energy M1 + \u2206 and \u2212M1 to\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nK.S.

This gives a 3 to 1 ratio favoring\nthe higher energy line. Finally, for |\u03bc| > \u2206, the \u2212M0 to\nM1 interband transition (LHS) has energy M1 + \u2206 and\nthe intraband transition of M0 to M1 (RHS) has energy\nM1 \u2212 \u2206. The two lines have nearly the same intensity. It\nis clear that optics provides a useful probe for observing\nvarious kinds of gaps and here the excitonic gap is taken\nas an example.\nIn summary, we have found an anomaly in the first\nabsorption peak in the optical conductivity of graphene.\nWhen the chemical potential, tunable by the gate voltage, sweeps through the various LL energies, this peak\nnever halves its intensity before disappearing while the\nother lines do. This pattern of behavior is specific to the\nDirac nature of quasiparticles in graphene and should be\neasily observable in the experiments. It originates from\nthe special structure of LLs in graphene, where each positive energy level has its negative counterpart, except for\nthe zero energy lowest LL. For the Shubnikov de Haas\noscillations25 this structure of LLs resulted in a phase\nshift of \u03c0 used to identify these quasiparticles in the\ndc measurements2,3 . Furthermore, should an excitonic\ngap open in high magnetic field, its presence will lead\nto a specific signature in an ac optical experiment. For\n\u2206 < |\u03bc| < M1 , the n = 0 to n = 1 transition will split\ninto two lines of nearly equal intensity, while for |\u03bc| = \u2206\nthe intensity ratio of higher to lower energy line will be\nabout 3. For |\u03bc| < \u2206 the line will simply shift upward\nwithout splitting.\nThe work of V.P.G. was supported by the SCOPESproject IB7320-110848 of the Swiss NSF.
