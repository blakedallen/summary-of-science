Politecnico di Milano\nPiazza Leonardo da Vinci, 32. 20133 Milan, Italy\u2217\n(Dated: October 25, 2018)\nNematic liquid crystals possess three different phases: isotropic, uniaxial, and biaxial. The ground\nstate of most nematics is either isotropic or uniaxial, depending on the external temperature. Nevertheless, biaxial domains have been frequently identified, especially close to defects or external\nsurfaces. In this paper we show that any spatially-varying director pattern may be a source of biaxiality. We prove that biaxiality arises naturally whenever the symmetric tensor S = (\u2207n)(\u2207n)T\npossesses two distinct nonzero eigenvalues. The eigenvalue difference may be used as a measure\nof the expected biaxiality. Furthermore, the corresponding eigenvectors indicate the directions in\nwhich the order tensor Q is induced to break the uniaxial symmetry about the director n. We\napply our general considerations to some examples. In particular we show that, when we enforce\nhomeotropic anchoring on a curved surface, the order tensor become biaxial along the principal\ndirections of the surface. The effect is triggered by the difference in surface principal curvatures.\nPACS numbers:\n61.30.Gd - Orientational order of liquid crystals\n61.30.Hn - Surface phenomena: alignment, anchoring, . . . , surface-induced ordering, . . .\n61.30.Jf - Defects in liquid crystals\n\nNematic liquid crystals are aggregates of rod-like\nmolecules. Early theories [1, 2, 3] used a single order\nparameter, the director , a unit vector pointing along the\naverage microscopic molecular orientation. Most nematic\nphenomena fit well within the classical description. However, the transition from ordered to disordered states escapes the director theory. The classical microscopic description of defects and surface phenomena yields undesired results as well. The order-tensor theory put forward\nby de Gennes [4, 5] focuses on the orientational probability distribution, and introduces the measures of the\ndegree of orientation and biaxiality. Within this theory,\na nematic liquid crystal possesses three different phases,\nwhich can be identified through their optical properties,\nsince its Fresnel ellipsoid is closely related to the order\ntensor itself [6]. A isotropic liquid crystal is characterized\nby an isotropic order tensor, and optically behaves as an\nordinary fluid. A uniaxial nematic possesses a unique optic axis. Its order tensor has two coincident eigenvalues.\nFinally, in a biaxial nematic the eigenvalues of the order\ntensor are all different, and the Fresnel ellipsoid possesses\ntwo optic axes.\nWithin the Landau-de Gennes theory, the ground state\nmay be either isotropic or uniaxial, depending on the external temperature. However, biaxial domains have been\npredicted and observed, especially close to defects and external boundaries. Schopohl and Sluckin [7] analyzed in\ndetail the biaxial core of a + 12 nematic disclination. More\nrecent studied show that a biaxial cloud surrounds most\nnematic defects [8], and both analytic [9, 10] and numeric\n[11, 12] asymptotical descriptions of biaxial defect cores\nhave been derived. Other examples of defect-induced bi-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: paolo.biscari@polimi.it\n\naxiality involve integer-charged disclinations [13, 14, 15]\nand cylindrical inclusions [16]. The onset of surface biaxiality is closely related to the presence of a symmetrybreaking special direction, which coincides with the surface normal [17]. Indeed, biaxiality has been predicted\nclose to both external boundaries [18, 19] and internal\nisotropic-nematic interfaces [20, 21].\nIn this paper we show that biaxiality effects are closely\nrelated to, but not exclusively confined to, the examples above. In fact, within any spatially-varying director\ndistribution, the director gradient itself breaks uniaxial\nsymmetry about the director. We analyze in detail the\nstructure of the elastic free energy density and come up to\nthe result that, given the director distribution, it is possible to predict the onset of biaxiality, to determine the\ndirection of the secondary optic axis and to estimate the\nintensity of biaxiality effects. We then apply our general\nconsiderations to some specific examples, both within the\nbulk and close to an external boundary. We remark that\nwe are not dealing with intrinsically biaxial nematic liquid crystals, that is systems in which the ground state\nitself becomes biaxial. Such systems, first observed by\nYu and Saupe [22], deserve a different treatment [23, 24],\nsince in them uniaxial symmetry is broken already at a\nmolecular level.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections I and\nII we quickly review the order-tensor theory and the free\nenergy density we aim at minimizing. In Section III we\nderive and describe our main result, predicting a possible\nonset of biaxiality whenever the director is not uniform.\nIn the following Sections IV and V we apply the preceding results to some specific examples. In Section VI we\ncollect and discuss our main results, while some Appendices collect the technical details of the proofs.\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nII.\n\nORDER TENSOR\n\nThe orientation of a single nematic molecule may be\nrepresented by a unit vector n \u2208 S2 , where S2 is the unit\nsphere. Microscopic disorder is taken into account by introducing a probability measure fx : S2 \u2192 R+ , such that\nfx (m) describes the probability that a molecule placed\nin x is oriented along m. The probability measure fx is\neven, since opposite orientations are physically equivalent.\nNematic optics is determined by the variance tensor\nM = h m \u2297 m i, where the tensor product is defined\nin (A8) and the brackets denote averaging with respect\nto fx . By definition, M is symmetric and semidefinite\npositive. Since, in addition, the trace of M is equal to 1,\nwe define the traceless order tensor Q = M \u2212 13 I, where\nI is the identity.\nWe label the nematic as isotropic when all the eigenvalues of Q coincide, which implies Qiso = 0. When\nat least two eigenvalues are equal, the nematic is called\nuniaxial . Simple algebraic manipulations allow to write\nQuni\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n=s n\u2297n\u2212 I ,\n3\n\n(1)\n\nThe scalar parameter s is the degree of orientation [25],\nwhile the unit vector n is the director. The eigenvalues\nof Quni are 32 s (associated with n) and \u2212 13 s (with multiplicity 2). The director is then the eigenvector associated with the different eigenvalue. Equivalently, n could\nbe also identified as the eigenvector associated with the\neigenvalue whose sign is different from the other two.\nWhen the eigenvalues of the order tensor are all different, the nematic is labeled as biaxial . In this general case,\nwe can use the above remark, and still identify the director as the eigenvector of Q whose eigenvalue has a different sign with respect to the other two. This definition\nmay induce an artificial director discontinuity whenever\nthe intermediate eigenvalue crosses 0. In turn, it yields\nan operative definition that works well when the order\ntensor is possibly biaxial, but however close to being uniaxial. Once we have introduced the director, we again\ndefine the degree of orientation s = 32 \u03bbn , where \u03bbn is the\neigenvalue associated with n. The other two eigenvalues \u03bb\u00b1 can be finally written in terms of the degree of\nbiaxiality \u03b2: \u03bb\u00b1 = \u2212 31 s \u00b1 \u03b2. As a result we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nQbia = s n \u2297 n \u2212 I + \u03b2 (e+ \u2297 e+ \u2212 e\u2212 \u2297 e\u2212 ) . (2)\n3\nThe sign of \u03b2 is unessential, since it only involves an\nexchange between e+ and e\u2212 . The degree of biaxiality\ndoes always satisfy |\u03b2| \u2264 13 |s|. Indeed, when |\u03b2| = 31 |s|\none of the eigenvalues vanishes, and greater biaxiality\nvalues would in fact announce an abrupt change in the\ndirector (and in the degree of orientation as well).\n\nFREE ENERGY FUNCTIONAL\n\nEquilibrium states of nematic liquid crystals are identified as extremals of the free-energy functional whose\ndensity, in the absence of external fields, comprises two\nterms\n\u03a8(Q, \u2207Q) = \u03a8el (Q, \u2207Q) + \u03a8LdG (Q) .\n\n(3)\n\nThough all the calculations we report could be repeated in a more general framework, we will adopt the\n1-constant approximation for the elastic contribution \u03a8el\n\u03a8el (Q, \u2207Q) =\n\nK\n|\u2207Q|2 ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere K is an average elastic constant.\nThe Landau-de Gennes potential \u03a8LdG is a temperature-dependent thermodynamic contribution that takes\ninto account the material tendency to spontaneously arrange in ordered or disordered states:\n\u03a8LdG (Q) = A tr Q2 \u2212 B tr Q3 + C tr Q4 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe material parameter C must be positive to keep the\nfree-energy functional bounded from below. The potential (5) depends only on the eigenvalues of Q, and penalizes biaxial states [26]. Insertion of (2) into (5) returns\n\u0001\n2\nCs4 \u2212 Bs3 + 3As2\n9\n\u0001\n2\n+\n6Cs2 + 9Bs + 9A \u03b2 2 + 2C\u03b2 4 .\n9\n\n\u03a8LdG (s, \u03b2) =\n\n(6)\n\nLet \u03b1 = 3A/(Cs20 ). The absolute minimum of \u03a8LdG is\nlocated at the uniaxial configuration (s0 > 0, \u03b2 = 0),\nprovided\n\u03b1 \u2208 [\u22122, 1] and B =\n\n2\n3\n\nCs0 (\u03b1 + 2) .\n\n(7)\n\nWhen looking for minimizers of the free energy functional, we take into account that Landau-de Gennes' contribution usually dominates the elastic one. This approximation holds as long as we do not get too close to a nematic defect. Indeed, experimental observations confirm\nthat neither s nor \u03b2 depart easily from their preferred\nvalues (s0 , 0).\nWe then envisage a two-step minimization. In the first\nstep (s, \u03b2) are constrained to their optimal values. Minimization proceeds exactly as in Frank's director theory\nand yields an optimal distribution n(r). In the second\nstep, we fix the director distribution and determine the\nperturbative corrections it induces in the optimal values\nof the scalar order parameters. As a result, we prove\nthat non-uniform director configurations may induce a\nnonzero degree of biaxiality, and a reduction in the degree of orientation. As a by-product we determine how a\nnon-zero director gradient breaks the local axial symmetry induced by the director, and which direction is chosen\nby most molecules (among those orthogonal to n).\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nBULK BIAXIALITY\n\nWe collect in the present section our main result. In\norder to ease the reader we defer most of the technical\nproofs to the appendices below. We assume that a specific director distribution n(r) has been determined by\nminimizing Frank's free-energy functional, constrained\nby suitable boundary conditions. The director distribution may also take into account the effects of any possible\nexternal field.\nIn Appendix A we prove the following decomposition\nfor the director gradient\n\u0001\n\u2207n = \u03bb2 e2 \u2297 e2 + \u03bb3 e3 \u2297 e3 + curl n \u2227 n \u2297 n\n+\n\n1\n2\n\n(n * curl n) W(n) ,\n\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 )2 = (c22 \u2212 c23 + \u03bb23 \u2212 \u03bb22 )2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere W(n) denotes the skew tensor associated with n\n(see Appendix A). Furthermore, {\u03bb2 , \u03bb3 }, {e2 , e3 } are\nrespectively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the symmetric part of G = \u2207n\u2212(\u2207n)n\u2297n, the third eigenvector\nof sym G being n, with null eigenvalue. We remark that\ndiv n = tr \u2207n = \u03bb2 + \u03bb3 .\n\nthe term within brackets is maximized when {e+ , e\u2212 } coincide with the two eigenvectors of S that are orthogonal\nto n. If we denote by \u03bc+ , \u03bc\u2212 the correspondent eigenvalues, the linear term becomes simply proportional to\n(\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 ). We thus arrive at the following result. Consider the symmetric tensor S = (\u2207n) (\u2207n)T . It always\npossesses a null eigenvalue (with eigenvector n). Whenever its other two eigenvalues do not coincide, biaxiality is naturally induced in the system, and the optimal\neigendirections of Q coincide with those of S.\nIf we take into account expression (8) for \u2207n, we can\ngive the eigenvalue difference (\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 ) the following\nexpression (see (A7))\n\n(9)\n\nLet S be the symmetric tensor S = (\u2207n) (\u2207n)T . By\nvirtue of (A1) the director n is an eigenvector of S (with\nnull eigenvalue). In Appendix B we prove that the elastic\nfree energy density may be given the following form\nh\n\u03a8el = K 13 |\u2207s|2 + |\u2207\u03b2|2 + s2 |\u2207n|2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+\u03b2 2 |\u2207n|2 + 4|(\u2207e+ )T e\u2212 |2\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n(10)\n\u22122s\u03b2 e+ * Se+ \u2212 e\u2212 * Se\u2212 .\nLet us analyze in detail the different terms appearing in\n(10). The first two terms are trivial, since they simply penalize spatial variations of the scalar order parameters. They remind that, even in the presence\n\u0001 of\nspatially-varying preferred values sopt (r), \u03b2opt (r) , the\nequilibrium distribution may not imitate the optimal values. The third term is proportional to s2 |\u2207n|2 . This\nterm has been already extensively studied [25, 27]. Its\nnet effect is a decrease in the degree of orientation in\nplaces where the director gradient is most rapidly varying. In particular, it strongly pushes the system towards\nthe isotropic state s = 0 when the director gradient diverges. The second-last term is proportional to \u03b2 2 . Since\nit is positive-definite, it simply enhances the character of\n\u03b2 = 0 as optimal biaxiality value. Thus, were not for the\nfinal term we will next consider, biaxiality would never\narise naturally in a nematic liquid crystal.\nThe last term in (10) is linear in \u03b2. It shifts the optimal\nbiaxiality value away from \u03b2 = 0. In order to minimize\nthe complete free energy density it is worth to maximize\nthe multiplying factor depending on S. This condition\ndetermines the directions {e+ , e\u2212 } in which the order\ntensor Q is pushed to break uniaxial symmetry. Indeed,\n\n\u00012\n+ 4 c2 c3 + 21 cn (\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb2 ) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere curl n = cn n+c2 e2 +c3 e3 , and \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 are as in (8).\nIn the following sections we will apply the above results\nto some practical situations, in order to better interpret\ntheir implications.\nIV.\n\nSPLAY, BEND AND TWIST BIAXIALITY\nA.\n\nPure splay\n\nWe begin by considering the splay field n(r) = er ,\nwhere er is the radial unit vector in cylindrical coordinates. If we complete an orthonormal basis by introducing the tangential and axial unit vectors e\u03b8 , ez ,\nstandard calculations allow to prove that the relevant\nfields are given by\n\u2207n =\n\n1\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8\nr\n\nsym G = G = \u2207n =\n\n=\u21d2\n\ncurl n = 0\n\n1\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8\nr\n\n1\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8\nr2\n(\u2207e+ )T e\u2212 = (\u2207e\u03b8 )T ez = 0 .\nS = (\u2207n)2 =\n\n(12)\n\nThus, \u03bc+ = r\u22122 , \u03bc\u2212 = 0, and the elastic free energy\ndensity is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n(s \u2212 \u03b2)2\n2\n2\n\u03a8el = K\n.\n(13)\n|\u2207s| + |\u2207\u03b2| +\n3\nr2\nBiaxiality favours the tangential direction with respect\nto the axial direction. The r\u22122 factor implies that biaxiality (and the degree of orientation decrease as well) is\nexpected to show close to the symmetry axis. Figures 3\nand 5 of [13] exactly confirm this result.\nB.\n\nPure bend\n\nWe again consider the same cylindrical coordinate\nframe above, and analyze the bend field n(r) = e\u03b8 .

This\nresult turns out to be particularly challenging, if we consider that in Cladis-Kl\u00e9man's escape in the third dimension the tilt angle \u03c6 is given by\n\n1\nez\nr\n\nAgain, \u03bc+ = r\u22122 , \u03bc\u2212 = 0, and the elastic free energy\ndensity can given exactly the same expression (13). Biaxiality now favours the radial direction, and again concentrates close to the (disclination) symmetry axis.\nC.\n\nPure twist\n\nWe now introduce a Cartesian frame {ex , ey , ez } and\nconsider the twist field n(r) = cos kz ex + sin kz ey . If we\nintroduce the unit vector n\u22a5 (r) = \u2212 sin kz ex + cos kz ey ,\nwe obtain\n\u2207n = k n\u22a5 \u2297 ez\nG = \u2207n =\u21d2\nT\n\n(\u2207e+ ) e\u2212 = (\u2207n\u22a5 ) ez = 0 .\n\n(15)\n\nWe now have \u03bc+ = k 2 , \u03bc\u2212 = 0. Biaxiality favours n\u22a5 ,\nthat is, the (x, y) plane, with respect to the transverse\ndirection ez . The elastic free energy density does again\ncoincide with (13), with only a k 2 replacing the r\u22122 factor. However, this coincidence must not induce to guess\nthat \u03a8el does always depend on s and \u03b2 only through the\ncombination (s \u2212 \u03b2), as we will evidence below.\nD.\n\nThird-dimension escape\n\nAll the model cases analyzed above share a peculiar\nproperty. Indeed, the fields n(r) considered are all planar, in that they are all orthogonal to a fixed direction (z-axis). Therefore it is of no surprise that we\nalways find some degree of biaxiality which penalizes\nthe avoided direction. We now consider a less trivial example: the escape in the third-dimension. This\nfield was first determined by Cladis and Kl\u00e9man [28]\nas an everywhere continuous director field able to fulfill homeotropic boundary conditions on a cylinder. Let\nn(r) = cos \u03c6(r) er + sin \u03c6(r) ez be the director field, and\nlet n\u22a5 (r) = \u2212 sin \u03c6(r) er + cos \u03c6(r) ez . We obtain\ncos \u03c6\n\u2207n =\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8 + \u03c6\u2032 n\u22a5 \u2297 er\nr\ncurl n = \u2212\u03c6\u2032 cos \u03c6 e\u03b8\ncos \u03c6\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 sin \u03c6 n\u22a5 \u2297 n\u22a5\nsym G = G =\nr\ncos2 \u03c6\nS=\ne\u03b8 \u2297 e\u03b8 + \u03c6\u20322 n\u22a5 \u2297 n\u22a5 .\n(16)\nr2\n\nr\n\u03c0\n\u2212 2 arctan .\n2\nR\n\n(17)\n\nA simple calculation allows to show that (17) implies\n\u03c6\u20322 = cos2 \u03c6/r2 . Thus, the third-dimension escape turns\nout to be one of the few spatially-varying director fields\nwhich do not induce any biaxiality.

We consider separately the cases of\nhomeotropic and planar anchoring. Differential calculus formulae that turn out to be useful for both cases are\ncollected in Appendix C.\nA.\n\nHomeotropic anchoring\n\nWe first assume that the surface director is parallel to\nthe unit normal \u03bd to a given (smooth) surface \u03a3. We\nalso assume that the director keeps its normal direction,\nat least in a thin surface slab. To be more precise, we parameterize bulk points through a coordinate set (u, v, \u03be)\nsuch that\nP (u, v, \u03be) = P\u03a3 (u, v) + \u03be \u03bd(u, v) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere P\u03a3 is the projection of P onto \u03a3, \u03be is the distance\nof P from the fixed surface, and \u03bd is the unit normal at\nP\u03a3 (see Figure 1). If \u03a3 if smooth, the coordinate set is\nwell-defined in a \u0001finite neighborhood\nof \u03a3. We assume\n\u0001\nthat n P (u, v, \u03be) = n P\u03a3 (u, v) = \u03bd(u, v). Then, \u2207n\nturns out to be closely related to the curvature tensor. It\nis symmetric and can be written as (see (C2))\n\u2207n = \u2212\n\n\u03ba1\n\u03ba2\ne1 \u2297 e1 \u2212\ne2 \u2297 e2 ,\n1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be\n1 \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03be\n\n(20)\n\nwhere {\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 } and {e1 , e2 } denote respectively the principal curvatures and principal directions at P\u03a3 . From\nthem we obtain curl n = 0, G = \u2207n, and\nS=\n\n\u03ba22\n\u03ba21\ne\n\u2297\ne\n+\ne2 \u2297 e2 .\n1\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be)2\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03be)2\n\n(21)\n\n\f5\nP (u, v, \u03be)\n\u03be\ne2\n\u03bd\ne1\nP\u03a3 (u, v)\n\n\u03a3\n\nFIG. 1: Geometric setting for the surface parametrization\nintroduced in the text.\n\nEquation (21) shows that biaxiality arises naturally close\nto an external surface where homeotropic anchoring is enforced. This effect is triggered by the difference between\nthe principal curvatures. More precisely, the tangent direction preferred by the order tensor is the one along\nwhich the surface curves more rapidly. Close to a symmetric saddle, where \u03ba1 = \u2212\u03ba2 , the denominator of (21)\ninduces biaxiality along the direction which is convex towards the side occupied by the liquid crystal.\nB.\n\nPlanar anchoring\n\n\u03ba1\n\u03bd \u2297 e1\n1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be\n\nG=0\n\nand S =\n\n=\u21d2\n\ncurl n = \u2212\n\n\u03ba21\n\u03bd \u2297\u03bd .\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be)2\n\n\u03ba1 e 2\n1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be\n(22)\n\nThus, in the presence of planar anchoring, biaxiality\narises whenever the curvature along the prescribed direction is different from zero. When this is the case, the\nbiaxiality direction coincides with the unit normal.\nVI.\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n6Cs2 + 9Bs + 9A \u03b2 2 \u2212 2Ks\u03b2 \u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212\n9\n\u0001\n\u2248 2(2 + \u03b1)Cs20 \u03b2 2 \u2212 2Ks0 \u03b2 \u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212\n\u0001 \u0011\n2Ks0 \u0010 2\n2\n\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u03b2 ,\n(23)\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u03bc\n=\n+\n\u2212\nn\n\u03ben2\n\ng(\u03b2) =\n\nWhen planar anchoring is enforced on a curved surface, it is natural to assume that the chosen direction\ncoincides with one of the principal directions along \u03a3.\nWe then keep\nas above, and assume\n\u0001 the same notations\n\u0001\nn P (u, v, \u03be) = n P\u03a3 (u, v) = e1 (u, v). When this is the\ncase, by (C2) we obtain\n\u2207n =\n\nis closely related to the vector curl n and the eigenvalues\nentering in the decomposition (8) of the director gradient.\nIn Section IV we have applied the considerations above\nto some model cases. As it could be easily predicted\nthe pure splay, bend, and twist fields, being all planar, exhibit some degree of biaxiality which privileges\nthe director plane over the orthogonal director. A less\ntrivial result is that there are spatially-varying director configurations that do not induce biaxiality at all.\nCladis-Kl\u00e9man's escape in the third dimension yields a\nunexpected example of this phenomenon. Section V analyzes the onset of surface biaxiality both in the case of\nhomeotropic and planar alignment. In the former case,\nbiaxiality is ruled by the difference between the principal curvatures along the surface. In the latter, only one\ncurvature counts, and more precisely the one along the\nprescribed direction in the tangent plane.\nTo conclude our analysis we want to give a numerical\nestimate of the magnitude of the biaxiality phenomena\nwe are predicting. In all nontrivial cases, the free-energy\ndensity will contain a O(\u03b2)-term, which triggers the biaxiality onset. To obtain a rough estimate, we can neglect\nthe O(\u03b2 4 )-term in \u03a8LdG , and the O(\u03b2 2 )-term in \u03a8el , both\nwith respect to the dominant O(\u03b2 2 )-term, appearing in\n\u03a8LdG . When this is the case, the (local) preferred value\nof \u03b2 may be obtained by minimizing the function\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have shown that any spatially-varying director distribution may induce the onset in biaxial domains even\nin nematic liquid crystals whose ground state is strictly\nuniaxial. In particular, in Section III we have stressed\nthe crucial role played by S = (\u2207n)(\u2207n)T . The tensor\nS, which is symmetric and positive-semidefinite by construction, possesses always a null eigenvalue, with eigenvector n. Equation (10) shows that biaxiality arises naturally whenever the other two eigenvalues of S are different. Then, equation (11) shows that such eventuality\n\nwhere we have replaced s \u2248 s0 and introduced the nematic coherence length\n\u03ben2 =\n\nK\n.\nCs0 (2 + \u03b1)\n\n(24)\n\nThe (local) optimal value of the degree of biaxiality is\nthen\n\u0001\n\u03b2opt \u2248 21 \u03ben2 \u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 .\n(25)\n\nThough \u03b2opt may vary from point to point, we have to\nkeep in mind that in general the equilibrium configuration will not coincide with \u03b2opt because of the |\u2207\u03b2|2 term, and the boundary conditions. To make an explicit\nexample, let us consider a nematic cylindric capillary of\nradius R, with homeotropic conditions enforced at the\nsurface. Then, the difference between the eigenvalues of\nS at the surface is R\u22122 and the surface biaxiality is of\nthe order of (\u03ben /R)2 . Since the nematic coherence length\nhardly exceeds the tenths of a \u03bcm, we obtain \u03b2opt . 10\u22122\nfor a \u03bcm-capillary. The scenario changes completely close\nto a nematic defect, where at least one of the eigenvalues\nof S diverges. Both the pure-splay and the pure-bend\nexamples above yield (\u03bc+ \u2212 \u03bc\u2212 ) = r\u22122 , which implies\n\u03b2opt \u2248 (\u03ben /r)2 . The biaxiality cloud cannot be neglected\nif we come too close to the defect.\n\n\f6\nAPPENDIX A: DIRECTOR GRADIENT\n\nAPPENDIX B: ORDER TENSOR GRADIENT\n\nIn order to characterize the tensor \u2207n we begin by\nnoticing that\n\u0001\n1\n(A1)\n(\u2207n)T n = \u2207 n * n = 0 ,\n2\nsince n is a unit vector.

We\nparameterize points in the bulk through a coordinate set\n(u, v, \u03be) such that\nP (u, v, \u03be) = P\u03a3 (u, v) + \u03be \u03bd(u, v) ,\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere P\u03a3 is the projection of P onto \u03a3, and \u03be is the\ndistance of P from the same surface. Such coordinate set\nis well-defined in a finite neighborhood of \u03a3.\nLet us consider\nthe vector\u0001 field everywhere defined as\n\u0001\n\u03c4 P (u, v, \u03be) = \u03bd P\u03a3 (u, v) . The second-order tensor\n\n\f7\n\u2207\u03c4 is symmetric. It generalizes the curvature tensor\n\u2207\u03a3 \u03bd, which is defined only on the tangent bundle of \u03a3.\nThe eigenvectors of \u2207\u03c4 coincide with those of the curvature tensor, and are thus the unit normal (with null\neigenvalue) and the (tangent) principal directions on \u03a3.\nIf we introduce {\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 }, the principal curvatures on \u03a3,\nand their corresponding eigenvectors {e1 , e2 }, we have\n\u03ba1\n\u03ba2\ne1 \u2297 e1 \u2212\ne2 \u2297 e2\n(C2)\n1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be\n1 \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03be\n\u03ba2\n\u03ba1\n\u03bd \u2297 e1 and \u2207e2 =\n\u03bd \u2297 e2 .\n\u2207e1 =\n1 \u2212 \u03ba1 \u03be\n1 \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03be\n\u2207\u03c4 = \u2212\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nC.W.
