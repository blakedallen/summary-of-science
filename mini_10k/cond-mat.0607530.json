These studies are an extension of earlier research\nconcerning the closed version of such systems, where the\nmain question is their ergodicity. The pioneering work\nin this area is centered on the system called Sinai billiard, a circular billiard with a smaller circular exclusion\narea in its interior [6], which was shown to be ergodic.\nOther two-dimensional ballistic billiards are known to be\nergodic as well, such as the Bunimowitch stadium [4, 7].\nOne main interest in the studies of open billiards is the\ndecay dynamics for long times. Bauer and Bertsch [1]\nfound an exponential decay in an chaotic dynamics and\na power law decay for a system with regular dynamics.\nThese first results concerning the integrable case where\nlater questioned by Legrand and Sornette [2], but it became clear that the difficulty in settling this question\nusing numerical experiments is related to the high sensitivity of the results to initial conditions [3]. In a more detailed simulational study for the chaotic two-dimensional\nBunimovich stadium [4], algebraic tails were found at sufficiently long times, but the weight of the algebraic tail\ntends to zero in the limit where the size of the aperture\nvanishes.\nIn the classical circular billiard the (non-interacting)\nparticles undergo elastic specular collisions with the wall.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jstilck@if.uff.br\n\nSince two quantities are conserved (kinetic energy and\nangular momentum), the system is integrable and therefore non-ergodic [8]. A recent study of the open version of\nthis system was undertaken by Vicentini and Kokshenev\n[5], and the algebraic long time of the survival probability\nwas studied in detail, in the limit of a very small opening\n(weakly open billiard), using a coarse-grained description\nof the system. Here we study the problem making use of\na probabilistic approach: starting from a random initial\ncondition of the particles inside the vesicle, we calculate\nthe joint probability distribution (in the angular position\nof point where the border is reached and the angle of incidence) at successive times the border of the vesicle is\nreached. This approach is not limited to small openings,\nactually it allows a full analytical treatment when the\nopening \u03b4 is larger than \u03c0/2 (\u03b4 = \u03c0/2 corresponds to a\nsemi-circular vesicle). It will become clear below that for\nhigher number of collisions with the wall, those particles\nwhich are close to periodic orbits which will never leave\nthe vesicle will still survive, and thus a selection of these\norbits will occur with increasing number of collision n.\nThis selection of orbits according to the incidence angle\n(or, equivalently, to the angular momentum) was already\nfound in the numerical experiments performed in [5], and\nemerges in a simple way in the probabilistic calculations\nbelow. The algebraic decay of the probability that the\nparticle leaves the vesicle at the n'th collision is obtained\nanalytically for large openings (\u03b4 > \u03c0/2).\nLet us define the problem. The initial position of a\nparticle is distributed uniformly inside the circular vesicle\nof radius r0 . The particle has a velocity of modulus v0 ,\nwhose direction is also uniformly distributed. After some\n\n\f2\nn'th time the border is reached. The initial joint distribution function is given by:\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c10 (r, \u03b1, \u03b80 ) =\n\n\u03b81\n\n0\n\n\u03b4\n\nFIG. 1: Movement of a particle, depicted at its initial position.\nThis particle leaves the vesicle when it reaches the border for\nthe second time. The indicated variables are described in the\ntext.\n\ntime, this particle reaches the border of the vesicle for\nthe first time, at an angle \u03b81 . If |\u03b81 | < \u03b4, the opening\nangle, the particle leaves the vesicle, otherwise it collides\nwith the wall and performs the second straight part of\nits movement inside the billiard. If we use r0 as our unit\nof length and r0 /v0 as our unit of time we may reduce\nthe problem to the case of unitary radius and modulus\nof velocity.\nIn Sec. II we define the problem in more detail and\npresent the analytical approach we adopted. The numerical study of the problem is described in Sec. III,\nand the simulational results are compared with the analytical ones and discussed. Further discussions and the\nconclusion may be found in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\n(1)\n\nr\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b3\n\nr\n,\n2\u03c0 2\n\nDEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM AND\nANALYTICAL APPROACH\n\nAs discussed in Sec. I, we consider a particle inside a\ncircular vesicle of unitary radius. The probability of the\ninitial position, described by a radius r (0 \u2264 r \u2264 1) and\nan angle \u03b80 (\u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b80 < \u03c0 ), is uniformly distributed. The\nmodulus of the initial velocity is unitary and the angle\n\u03b1 (\u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b1 < \u03c0)between the position vector and the velocity is also uniformly distributed. Somewhat later, the\nparticle reaches the border of the vesicle for the first time.\nIf the angle \u03b81 where this occurs is such that \u2212\u03b4 \u2264 \u03b81 \u2264 \u03b4,\nthe particle leaves the vesicle. Otherwise, the particle\ncollides in a specular way with the border of the vesicle,\ncontinuing its movement until the border is reached for\na second time at an angle \u03b82 . In figure 1 the trajectory\nof a particle is illustrated.\nThe movement of the particle is deterministic, but the\ninitial conditions are randomly distributed, and we are\ninterested in the joint distribution of probabilities at the\n\nand this leads to the marginal distributions \u03c10 (r) = 2r\nand \u03c10 (\u03b1) = \u03c10 (\u03b8) = 1/2\u03c0, which are consistent with the\ninitial conditions stated above. Simple geometrical considerations allow us now to relate the variables \u03b31 and t1\nand \u03b81 at the first time the particle reaches the border\nwith the original variables r, \u03b1, and \u03b80 . Notice that t1 ,\nthe time of the first arrival at the border, is numerically\nequal to the distance between the initial position and the\nposition of first arrival at the border. The angle of incidence \u03b31 is defined in the interval \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b31 \u2264 \u03c0/2,\nand negative values correspond to particles moving clockwise in the vesicle. With this convention, the signs of \u03b1\nand \u03b3 are the same. The relations between the variables\nmay be found applying trigonometric considerations to\nthe initial segment of the trajectory illustrated in figure\n1. The result is:\nq\nr =\n(2a)\nt21 \u2212 2t1 cos(\u03b31 ) + 1\nsin(\u03b31 )\ncos(\u03b31 ) \u2212 t1\n= \u03b81 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b3 1\n\ntan(\u03b1) =\n\n(2b)\n\n\u03b80\n\n(2c)\n\nThe joint distribution at the first arrival at the border is\nrelated to the initial joint distribution as follows:\n\u03c11 (\u03b31 , t1 , \u03b81 ) = \u03c10 (r, \u03b1, \u03b80 )\n\n\u2202(r, \u03b1, \u03b80 )\n.\n\u2202(\u03b31 , t1 , \u03b81 )\n\n(3)\n\nThe jacobian may then be calculated using expressions\n2. The result is:\ncos(\u03b31 )\n|J| = p 2\n,\nt1 \u2212 2t1 cos(\u03b31 ) + 1\n\n(4)\n\nand using the initial distribution 1, we obtain the joint\ndistribution at the first arrival at the border\n\u03c11 (\u03b31 , t1 , \u03b81 ) =\n\ncos(\u03b31 )\n.\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(5)\n\nFrom the joint distribution 5 the marginal distributions\nmay then be calculated. The result for t1 is:\nZ \u03c0\nZ arccos(t1 /2)\n1\n\u03c11 (t1 ) =\nd\u03b8\ncos(\u03b31 ) d\u03b31\n1\n2\u03c0 2 \u2212\u03c0\n\u2212 arccos(t1 /2)\nq\n2\n(6)\n=\n1 \u2212 t21 /4\n\u03c0\n\nand the marginal distributions of the other two variables\nfollow in a similar way:\n2\ncos2 (\u03b31 ),\n\u03c0\n1\n\u03c11 (\u03b81 ) =\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c11 (\u03b31 ) =\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\f3\nAs expected, the distribution of \u03b81 is uniform. The probability that the particle leaves the vesicle at the first arrival at the border is given by:\nZ \u03b4\n\u03b4\n(9)\np1 =\n\u03c11 (\u03b81 ) d\u03b81 = .\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u03b4\nDue to angular momentum conservation, the incidence\nangle will be the same at each subsequent time the particle reaches the border. Also, the time interval between\nthe first and n'th times at the border will simply be\nt\u2032n = tn \u2212 t1 = 2(n \u2212 1) cos(\u03b3). We therefore consider\nthis interval in the subsequent collisions and reduce our\nparameter space to the variables \u03b3n and \u03b8n . Integrating\n\u03c11 (t1 , \u03b31 , \u03b81 ) over t1 , we will get:\n\u03c11 (\u03b31 , \u03b81 ) =\n\n1\ncos2 (\u03b31 ).\n\u03c02\n\nd\u03b32\ndt\u20322\n2\n2\u03c42 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4)\np\n=\n,\n\u03c0 2 1 \u2212 \u03c422\n\n\u03c12 (t\u20322 ) = 2\u03c12 (\u03b32 )\n\n(10)\n\nNow we may relate the variables at the first and second\ntimes the border is reached:\n\u03b31 = \u03b32 ,\n\u03b81 = \u03b82 \u2212 \u03c0 + 2\u03b32 .\n\nOne notices that the distribution in \u03b82 is no longer uniform if \u03b4 > 0, displaying a maximum at \u03b82 = 0. This may\nbe explained qualitatively by the effect that due to the\naperture, it will be more probable for a particle to have a\npositive than a negative horizontal component of the velocity after the first collision, since all particles which left\nthe vesicle would have negative horizontal components if\nthey had collided with the wall. Also, comparing the\nmarginal distributions \u03c11 (\u03b31 ) and \u03c12 (\u03b32 ), we notice that\nthey differ just by a factor 1 \u2212 \u03b4/\u03c0, which accounts for\nthe particles that left the vesicle at the first time the border was reached. The distribution of t\u20322 may be obtained\nfrom \u03c12 (\u03b32 ):\n\n(11a)\n(11b)\n\nThe jacobian of this transformation is unitary, and thus\nthe joint distribution at the second time the border is\nreached will be\n\nwhere we defined \u03c42 = t\u20322 /2, which is restricted to the\ninterval [0, 2]. The probability that the particle leaves\nthe vesicle at the second time it reaches the border will\nbe:\nZ \u03b4\n\u03c12 (\u03b82 )d\u03b82 =\np2 = 2\n0\n\n1\n[\u03b4(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4) + sin2 (\u03b4)].\n\u03c02\n\n2\n\n\u03c12 (\u03b32 , \u03b82 ) =\n\ncos (\u03b32 )\nf (\u03b81 , \u03b4),\n\u03c02\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the function f (\u03b81 , \u03b4) = 1 if |\u03b81 | > \u03b4, and vanishes\notherwise, so that only particles which did not leave the\nvesicle at the first time the border was reached do contribute. Actually \u03b81 in the right hand side of equation\n12 should be written as a function of \u03b82 and \u03b32 using the\nequations 11. It is now easy to generalize this result for\nthe n'th time the particle reaches the border:\nn\u22121\ncos2 (\u03b3n ) Y\n\u03c1n (\u03b3n , \u03b8n ) =\nf (\u03b8i , \u03b4).\n\u03c02\ni=1\n\n(13)\n\nWe remark that in the absence of the aperture, the joint\ndistribution will be the same at any collision, and therefore for the closed circular billiard, the joint distribution\n10 and the marginal distributions 7 and 8 are the same\nfor any value of n. For n > 1 and when the billiard is\nopen, the joint distribution 13 is not normalized, since\nparticles leave the billiard through the aperture.\nNext, we may calculate the marginal distributions at\nthe second time the particle reaches the border. The\nresults are\nZ\ncos2 (\u03b32 ) \u03c0\n\u03c12 (\u03b32 ) =\nf (\u03b82 \u2212 \u03c0 + 2\u03b32 , \u03b4) d\u03b82\n\u03c02\n\u2212\u03c0\n2\n(14)\n= 2 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4) cos2 (\u03b32 ),\n\u03c0\nand\n\u03c12 (\u03b82 ) =\n\n1\n[\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4 + cos(\u03b82 ) sin(\u03b4)].\n2\u03c0 2\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nAs expected, this probability is larger than the value we\nwould obtain for a uniform distribution in \u03b82 , which is\n\u03b4(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4)/\u03c0 2 .\nIn general, to calculate the marginal distributions at\nthe n'th time the particle reaches the border, we have\nto integrate the joint distribution 13. For the incidence\nangle we obtain:\n\u03c1n (\u03b3n ) =\n=\n\ncos2 (\u03b3n )\n\u03c02\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0 n\u22121\nY\n\nf (\u03b8i , \u03b4) d\u03b8n\n\n\u2212\u03c0 i=1\n\ncos2 (\u03b3n )\nIn (\u03b3n , \u03b4),\n\u03c02\n\n(18)\n\nwhile the expression for the marginal distribution in \u03b8n\nis:\nZ \u03c0/2\nn\u22121\nY\n1\n2\nf (\u03b8i , \u03b4) d\u03b3n\n\u03c1n (\u03b8n ) = 2\ncos (\u03b3n )\n\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0/2\ni=1\n=\n\n1\nJn (\u03b8n , \u03b4).\n\u03c02\n\n(19)\n\nThe distribution of the time t\u2032n may be found generalizing\nequation 16.

The\nregion where a particular function f (\u03b8n\u2212j , \u03b4) vanishes is\na set of j + 1 parallel stripes, as may be seen in figure\n2. In this figure, which corresponds to n = 4, the two\nwider stripes correspond to (\u03b84 , 2\u03b34 ) values such that\n|\u03b83 | < \u03b4, the three stripes of intermediate width correspond to |\u03b82 | < \u03b4 and points inside the four narrowest\nstripes are such that |\u03b81 | < \u03b4. The expressions for the\nstripes are obtained by a recursive application of equations 11 which relate the variables at successive times the\nparticle reaches the border.\nThe integrals In and Jn are continuous functions of\ntheir variables, but may display discontinuities in their\nderivatives. Their expressions are different in distinct\nranges of their arguments. Although the calculation of\nthese functions is rather straightforward, the identification of the ranges of integration becomes harder as the\nnumber of the collision n grows, the number of different\nexpressions increases quite fast with n. In the general\ncase, we performed the calculations up to n = 4. For\n\u03b4 \u2265 \u03c0/2, however, the calculation of the marginal distributions may be accomplished for any value of n.

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS AND\nCOMPARISON WITH SIMULATIONS\n\nInitially, we show results for \u03c11 (t1 ) obtained with a\nsimulation of 1011 particles starting at the initial condition, that is, initial position inside the unitary circle\nwith uniform probability density and the direction of the\ninitial velocity also uniformly distributed. In figure 3\nthe simulational results for the time of first arrival t1\nare shown and compared with the analytical expression\n(6). In the same figure the numerical results for \u03c11 (\u03b31 )\nare compared with expression (7). It is apparent that\nthe numerical results are compatible with the analytical\ncurves.\nAlthough we realized many simulations starting from\nthe initial condition, most of the numerical results shown\nhere were obtained starting the simulation at the first\ncollision of the particle with the wall (n = 1). With\nthe same computational effort, these simulations led to\nmuch better results than the ones starting from the initial\n\n\f5\n(a)\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c1(\u03b3)\n\n\u03c11(t1)\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nt1\n(b)\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0.6\n\n\u03c11(\u03b31)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-2\n\n0.4\n\n-1\n\n0\n\u03b3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03b31\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: Results from simulations for \u03c11 (t1 ) (graph a) and\n\u03c11 (\u03b31 .)

The numerical results are indicated by circles and the full lines are the corresponding analytical curves\n(equations 6 and 7, respectively).\n\ncondition, since only two variables define this condition\nnow, instead of the three we have if the simulation starts\nat the initial condition.The numerical procedure followed\nin these simulations for a particular value of \u03b4 was:\n1. N\u03b8 of values for \u03b81 , uniformly spaced in the interval\n[\u2212\u03c0, \u2212\u03b4] \u222a [\u03b4, \u03c0] are chosen.\n2. For each value of \u03b81 , N\u03b3 values for the incidence\nangle \u03b31 are generated randomly with the probability density 7, and the subsequent loci of arrival\nof the particle are calculated for n = 2, 3, . . ., up to\na maximum number nmax .\n3. At the n'th arrival at the border, the values of \u03b8n ,\n\u03b3n , and t\u2032n are recorded, so that estimates for the\nmarginal probability densities of these variables are\nobtained. If \u2212\u03b4 \u2264 \u03b8n \u2264 \u03b4, the counter of the number of particles leaving the vesicle at the n'th arrival\nat the border is increased by one and the simulation of a new particle starts. If n = nmax , the\nsimulation of a new particle is started, otherwise\nwe proceed to step n + 1.\nThe results shown below were obtained with the choices\nN\u03b8 = 105 , N\u03b3 = 105 , so that a total of 1010 particles are\nconsidered in each simulation. We chose nmax = 30.\nIn figure 4 we show simulational and analytical results\nfor the marginal distribution \u03c1(\u03b3) when \u03b4 = 0.5. One notices that the agreement between simulation and theory is\nvery good for the first four values of n, much better than\nthe one observed in figure 3. This is due to the reduction of the number of initial conditions mentioned above.\n\nFIG. 4: Results for \u03c1n (\u03b3n ) for n = 2, 3, . . . 8. For the same\nvalue of \u03b3, \u03c1n is a non-increasing function of n. For n =\n2, 3, 4 the numerical results are indicated by circles and the\nfull lines are the corresponding analytical curves (equation\n18). For larger values of n, the lines correspond to results of\nsimulations. Values of n increase downwards.\n\nAnother feature which is apparent in these data is that\nas n grows, peaks appear in the distribution at specific\nvalues of \u03b3. The first peak to appear is located at \u03b3 = 0\nand is already apparent in the analytical expression for\n\u03c14 (\u03b34 ). These peaks are associated to periodic orbits in\nthe vesicle, already discussed in [8]. Between two arrivals\nat the border, the angle \u03b8 changes as \u2206\u03b8 = \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b3. If the\norbit closes after p collisions and the particle performs q\nturns in the vesicle, we have p\u2206\u03b8 = 2\u03c0q. Thus, the angle\n\u03b3p,q for this periodic orbit is:\n\u03b3p,q =\n\np \u2212 2q\n\u03c0,\n2p\n\n(27)\n\nwhere p and q have no common divisors, p \u2265 2q and we\nconsidered only particles moving counterclockwise (\u2206\u03b8 >\n0). The periodic orbits may therefore be associated to the\nrational numbers q/p. For example, p = 2, q = 1, corresponds to \u03b3 = 0: the particle moves along a diameter. A\npolygonal orbit with p vertexes corresponds to (p, 1). A\nsimple star with 5 vertices's is described by (5, 2).\nIn an open vesicle, only those periodic orbits with\n\u03c0/p > \u03b4 will last, and the peak will develop when n > p.\nThis may be simply understood if we consider that a particle in a periodic orbit characterized by an index p will\nreach the border of the vesicle at p equally spaced points.\nIf the angle between two fist neighbors is larger that 2\u03b4,\nfor appropriate values of \u03b81 the particle never reaches the\naperture and therefore remains inside the vesicle forever.\nOf course these orbits are a set of zero measure in the\ninitial conditions. The four peaks visible in figure 4 at\nnon-vanishing \u03b3 may be identified as (5, 2) (\u03b3 = \u03c0/10),\n(3, 1) (\u03b3 = \u03c0/6), (4, 1) (\u03b3 = \u03c0/4), and (5, 1) (\u03b3 = 3\u03c0/10).\nThe hexagon (6, 1) still fulfils the condition above for the\naperture \u03b4 = 0.5 (\u03c0/6 > 0.5), but since it is quite close\n\n\f6\n0.2\n\n0.03\n\n0.025\n0.15\n\n\u03c1(\u03b8)\n\n\u03c1(\u03b3)\n\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.05\n0.005\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\u03b3\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 5: Results for \u03c1n (\u03b3n ) for n = 4, 5, 6 and \u03b4 = 1.6. For\nn = 6 the numerical results are indicated by circles. Full lines\nare the analytical curves (equation 18).\n\nto the limit the corresponding peak at \u03b36,1 = \u03c0/3 is very\nsmall and hard to identify in the plots above. It is visible, however, in the results for larger values of n. Once\na peak appears, it will narrow with increasing n. This\nmay be explained noting that, of the particles with the\ncorresponding angle \u03b3p,q , some will leave the vesicle, but\nonly when n \u2264 p. Thus, the maximum value at the peak\nis stationary for n > p. However, particles with a slightly\ndifferent incidence angle still leave the vesicle for n > p.\nAs n \u2192 \u221e the peak shrinks to just one point. The condition on the initial value of \u03b8 which assures that a particle\nwith \u03b3 = \u03b3p,q will never leave the vesicle is l|\u03b81 | > \u03b4,\nfor l = 1, 2, . . . p and reducing each angle to the interval\n[\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0[. In summary, the periodic orbits correspond to\nhorizontal segments in the (\u03b81 , \u03b31 ) space of initial conditions. The initial conditions for a periodic orbit labeled\nas (q, p) in a vesicle with aperture \u03b4 are p segments at\n\u03b31 = \u03b3p,q , with length \u2206\u03981 = 2(\u03c0/p \u2212 \u03b4) and endpoints\n|\u03b8| at (\u03b4 + 2l\u03c0/p, \u03b4 + l\u03c0/p + \u03b4\u03b8), for l = 0, 1, 2, . . . , p/2.\nIn figure 2 these segments were drawn for the star orbit\n(5, 2) and for the diagonal orbit (2, 1).\nFor \u03b4 > \u03c0/2, all periodic orbits are suppressed, and\nwe are able to calculate the marginal distribution for any\nn. In figure 5 results for \u03b4 = 1.6 are shown for n =\n4, 5, 6. The absence of peaks related to any periodic orbit\nis apparent, and for n = 6 the agreement between the\nanalytical result (line) and the simulations (circles) may\nbe appreciated. In this case, all particles with |\u03b3| < ((n+\n1)\u03b4 \u2212 2\u03c0)/(n \u2212 1) leave the vesicle at the n'th time the\nborder is reached or before.\nMarginal distributions for \u03b8 are shown in figure 6 and\ncompared with the analytical results for n \u2264 4, also for\nthe case \u03b4 = 0.5. Again some peaks are observed, but\nthey are much broader than the ones in \u03c1(\u03b3). If we consider only a periodic orbit with p vertexes, we would\nhave p equally spaced rectangular peaks, of width \u2206\u03b81\ndefined above. Thus, as p grows approaching the limit-\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 6: Results for \u03c1n (\u03b8n ) for n = 2, 3, 4 . . . 8 and \u03b4 = 0.5. For\nn = 2, 3, 4 the numerical results are indicated by circles and\nthe full lines are the analytical curves (equation 19). For n >\n4, only simulational results are shown. Values of n increase\ndownwards.\n\ning value \u03c0/\u03b4 the peaks become narrower. Therefore, for\n\u03b4 = 0.5 the narrowest peaks belong to hexagons, and it is\nthis peak we may identify for largest values of \u03b8, located\nclose to \u03b8 = 2.61. For lower values of \u03b8 we have the superposition of several peaks and identification is harder.\nHowever, for larger n a step like structure develops at\nsmaller \u03b8, as expected. Although we do not show results\nhere for \u03b4 > \u03c0/2, where we obtained \u03c1n (\u03b8n ) analytically\nfor any n, as expected smooth curves are found, since no\nperiodic orbits survive in this case. All particles with\n|\u03b8| <\n\n(n + 1)\u03b4 \u2212 2\u03c0\nn\u22121\n\nleave the vesicle at the n'th arrival at the border or before.\nIn figure 7 we show results for the marginal distributions in the time t\u2032n between the n'th and first arrival\nof the border. Again a good agreement between analytical end numerical results is found for n = 2, 3, 4. As\nexpected, peaks develop at values which correspond to\nsurviving periodic orbits, as may already be seen in the\nsimulational results for larger values of n. The largest\npeak located at \u03c4n = t\u2032n /2(n \u2212 1) = 1 corresponds to the\ndiagonal periodic orbit (2, 1), the other periodic orbits\noriginate peaks at lower times. For \u03b4 > \u03c0/2 again results\nfor general n may be found and their agreement with\nsimulational results is very good. Since just polygonal\npaths q = 1 survive after some collisions in this case, the\nmaximum time a particle may spend inside the vesicle is\n2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4). This result may be obtained from the general\nexpression of \u03c1n (t\u2032n ) in the limit n \u2192 \u221e.\nFigure 8 shows results for the probability pn that a\nparticle leaves the vesicle as the border is reached the\nn'th time, as a function of the aperture \u03b4 for the cases\nwhere analytic results are available.

As\nmentioned above, p2 is always larger than the value for\nan uniform distribution, but in general we observe that\nfor an intermediate range of n, the exponential values\nare larger than the numerical results, but at sufficiently\nlarge n they again become smaller. For \u03b4 > \u03c0/2, we may\nexpand the expression 26 in 1/n and find the asymptotic\npower law behavior:\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n#\n\u0012 \u00135\n4\n1\n1\n2\n4\npn+1 = \u03c0 (1 \u2212 \u03b4/\u03c0)\n+2\n\u2212 . . . , (29)\nn\nn\nso that in this case we may assure that pn is larger than\npn,u for sufficiently large values of n. It remains an open\nquestion if this conclusion extends to \u03b4 < \u03c0/2, but our\nnumerical results are consistent with this possibility. For\nn = 3, 4, pn is larger than pn,u for \u03b4 in the range ]0, p0 [\nand smaller in the range ]p0 , \u03c0[, where p0 = \u03c0/2 for n = 3\nand p0 = 0.919725 . . . for n = 4.\nIV.\n\nfound between numerical and analytical results.

In other approaches,\nas usual, the time appears as the variable in terms of\nwhich the probability distributions are calculated. Although we did discuss somewhat the distribution of times\nat the first collisions, we did not enter in much detail in\nthis question here. This is the subject of ongoing work.\nIn the simulations, we also did not record results beyond\n30 collisions with the wall, so that the question of the\nasymptotic decay of pn for \u03b4 < \u03c0/2 was not discussed in\ndetail. As stated above, we have indications of a power\n\n\f8\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n,\n\n\u03c120(t 20 )\n\nlaw behavior, but the exponent may be different from\nthe value 4 found exactly for larger apertures. One may\nimagine that the existence of orbits in which the particles are trapped forever inside the vesicle for \u03b4 < \u03c0/2\nmay lead to a slower decay, with exponents smaller than\n4 in this case. It is true, as may be seen above, that these\norbits are a set of zero measure in the initial conditions,\nbut particles in a finite region close to those orbits may\ntake a long time to exit.\nAs was shown, the calculation of marginal distributions\nin the general case becomes more difficult for increasing\nn and finite \u03b4 < \u03c0/2. There is, however, a simplification\nwhen \u03b4 \u226a 1, that is, if we consider the first terms in the\nexpansion of the distributions in powers of \u03b4. This is the\nrange where other approaches, such as the one in [5], are\neffective.\nThere is a promising possibility to access the asymptotic behavior at long times if we recall that, after a certain number of collisions with the wall, the particles remaining in the vesicle will have incidence angles close to\nthe values defined for the surviving periodical orbits. As\nanother illustration of this, in figure 10 numerical results\nfor the distribution of the time interval t\u203220 = t20 \u2212 t1\nare depicted in a logarithmic scale for a simulation with\n\u03b4 = 0.5. The most important peak at t\u203220 = 38 corresponds to the vicinity of the diagonal orbit (2, 1). The\nother peaks in order of decreasing values of t\u203220 are the\nsame mentioned in the discussion of figure 4 above, but\nnow the small peak corresponding to the hexagon (6, 1) is\nvisible centered at t\u203220 = 38 cos(\u03b36,1 ) = 38 cos(\u03c0/3) = 19.\nThe small continuous distribution at low times corresponds to particles in high p orbits (whispering gallery\nmodes), which still did not reach the aperture after 19\ncollisions. As discussed above, this distribution is located\nat times smaller than 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4) and does not contribute at\nlarger times. We are presently working on an approach\nwhere the neighborhood of the periodic orbits is treated\nin a approximate way, which is should be appropriate for\nthe discussion of the long time limit.\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n,\n\n30\n\n40\n\nt 20\n\nFIG. 10: Probability density of the time interval t\u203220 obtained\nfrom simulations with \u03b4 = 0.5.

As may be seen in\nfigure 2, the domains of integration are split into regions\nwhere the product of f functions is equal to unity. This\nregions change as the variables of the marginal distri-\n\nbutions are varied, so that these distributions are given\nby different expression in different areas of the domain\nof their arguments. It is convenient to use the variable\n\u03c6n = 2\u03b3n in the functions In . For I3 these areas are\nshown in figure 11.\nFor a particular value of the argument \u03c63 , I3 is equal\nto to the sum of the segments in white regions of the\ncorresponding horizontal line in figure 2, if we erase the\nnarrowest stripes which correspond to n = 4. For \u03b4 \u2264\n\u03c0/2, this total length is equal to 2\u03c0 \u2212 4\u03b4 if \u03c63 \u2264 \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b4\nand to \u03c0 + \u03c63 \u2212 2\u03b4 otherwise.

However, for n \u2265 2 and \u03b4 \u2265 \u03c0/2 a major simplification occurs and it is easy to perform the calculations of In+1 and Jn+1 , since in the diagram corresponding to figure 2 in this case the white area is reduced to only two triangles and two quadrangles. The\nvertexes of the first triangle are located at \u03b8 = \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0,\n\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0, \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0(1 \u2212 1/n), and \u03b8 = \u2212\u03b4, \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0. The second triangle may be obtained by transforming \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8\nand \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6. The vertexes of the quadrangle are located at \u03b8 = \u03c0, \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0, \u03b8 = \u03c0, \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0(1 \u2212 1/n),\n\u03b8 = \u03b4, \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0, and \u03b8 = (\u03b4(n + 1) \u2212 2\u03c0)/(n \u2212 1), \u03c6 =\n\u2212((n \u2212 3)\u03c0 + 2\u03b4)/(n \u2212 1).
