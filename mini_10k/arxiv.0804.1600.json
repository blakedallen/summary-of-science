Advances in experimental techniques of trapping, cooling,\nand manipulation of internal states of ions through interaction with external lasers [4, 5, 6] have made the generation\nof maximally entangled states [7] a reality. While single atoms and ions, with long-lived internal states, are suitable for\nstoring quantum information, the photonic qubits serve as fast and reliable carriers to transport quantum information\nover long distances. Cirac et al. [8] considered the possibility of using photonic channels to interconnect high finesse\ncavities with single trapped ions inside. It was shown in ref. [9], that the composite quantum system with a single\ntrapped two-level ion interacting with a quantized light field in single-mode cavity evolves into maximally entangled\nthree-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. A different scheme to generate three qubit maximally entangled\nGHZ state, using a trapped ion interacting with a resonant external laser and sideband tuned single mode of a\ncavity field has been proposed in ref. [10] and the decoherence process of this three qubit system examined [11].\nExperimentally successful efforts in this direction [12, 13, 14], have demonstrated coherent coupling of electronic and\nmotional states of a single trapped Ca+ ion to single field mode of a high finesse cavity. In the experiment of ref.\n[12], a Ca+ ion in a RF-Paul trap was placed with high precision at an arbitrary position in the standing wave field\nof a near-confocal resonator for several hours of interaction time. Since the size of the cavity is large compared to\nthe wavelength of standing wave, a large number of nodes and antinodes of the standing wave are formed inside the\ncavity. The electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) method used in the work of Morigi et. al. [15] and Roos\net al. [16], could make possible the initialization of motional states of ion strings in a cavity. These experiments open\nthe possibility that more than one trapped ions may be cooled down to their lowest vibrational states and interact\nwith the quantized cavity field. A string of ions in the same trap with the center of mass in a definite motional mode\nmay, likewise, be prepared inside a cavity. In this article, we propose a scheme in which three two-level trapped\nions are cooled inside a high finesse cavity to generate multipartite entangled states through coherent coupling of\ntheir electronic and vibrational states to the standing wave cavity field. For the cavity field initially prepared in a\nnumber state, we obtain conditions on the interaction parameters to generate states in which three ions in W like\nstate are entangled to cavity photons. Tessier et al. [17] have investigated the multipartite entanglement of two\ntwo-level atoms, generated by resonant coupling to a single mode of the electromagnetic field. The resulting physical\nsystem corresponds to the two-atom Tavis-Cummings model [18]. Our system is similar to that of ref. [17] in that the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: shelly@uel.br\n\n\f2\nentanglement between the ions arises not through direct interaction between the ions, but through their coupling to\nthe phonon-photon system. We have not considered the effects of spontaneous decay, decoherence of motional states\nand cavity losses in this article. The object of studying a closed system, without decoherence effects, is to have a\nclear picture of dynamics of quantum correlations. The entanglement of mixed multipartite states resulting due to\ndecoherence is not so well understood. The memory qubits (ionic internal states) are known to have a coherence time\nof the order of seconds and even minutes (magnetically insensitive transitions). The success of experiments with a\nsingle ion indicates, that the motional decoherence caused by trap fluctuations or environment noise is negligible on\nthe time-scale of state generation and photon qubit coherence of the order of milisecs. The decoherence caused by\nthe implementation of the scheme itself needs to be studied theoretically for the three ion case though such studies\nfor single ion case have been done in refs. [11, 19].\nMultipartite entanglement is a useful resource for implementation of quantum information processing protocols\n[20]. To retrieve information about the entanglement of a group of K (2 \u2264 K \u2264 4) subsystems of the composite\nsystem, we use the global negativity and the partial K\u2212way negativities. For analyzing the entanglement dynamics,\nwe have considered the vibrational phonons and cavity photons to constitute a single quantum system. Negativity\n[21, 22, 23], based on Peres Horodecki [24, 25] criterion, has been shown to be an entanglement monotone [26]. The\nK\u2212way negativity refers to the negativity of a partial transpose constructed by imposing specific constraints during\ntransposition. The coherences of a multipartite composite system having N subsystems can be quantified by K\u2212way\nnegativities [27] (2 \u2264 K \u2264 N ). Partial K\u2212way negativity is the contribution of a specific K\u2212way partial transpose to\nglobal negativity. For canonical states, the partial K\u2212way negativities measure the genuine K\u2212partite entanglement\nof the system [28, 29]. Genuine K\u2212partite entanglement refers to K\u2212partite entanglement due to correlations simlar\nto those present in a GHZ-like state of K subsystems. Loss of a single subsystem destroys this type of entanglement\ncompletely, leaving no residual entanglement. We have obtained analytical expressions for partial K\u2212way negativities\nwith respect to photon-phonon state and internal states of ions. The advantage of using partial K\u2212way negativities\nlies in the fact that the entanglement between parts of a composite system is obtained from the full state operator,\nwithout state reduction. With the cavity prepared initially in a Fock state, the entanglement of ionic internal states\ndepends strongly on the choice of phonon number at t = 0. Extra control on qubit state manipulation, gained by\ncoupling the vibrational modes to the cavity field [13, 14], is an advantage for successful implementation of quantum\ngates.\nThe vector space and system Hamiltonian are discussed in section II. Analytical expressions for the state of the\nsystem at current time, with the three ions prepared in their respective (i) ground states, and (ii) excited states, are\npresented in section III. The role of initial state center of mass quanta in state manipulation and the time evolution\nof W-state generation probabilities is also discussed in section III. In section IV, the entanglement dynamics of ions,\nphonons and photons is investigated. The Global and partial K\u2212way negativities, used to study the entanglement\ndistribution in the composite system, are defined and calculated analytically as well as numerically for special initial\nstate preparations of the system. We discuss, briefly, the information gained from the dynamics of global and partial\nK\u2212way negativities in section V, followed by the conclusions in section VI.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nConsider three two level trapped cold ions vibrating with trap frequency \u03bd inside a high finesse cavity. The frequency\nof standing wave cavity field is \u03c9c and ions are well separated from each other so that no dipole interaction takes\nplace between the ions. The free Hamiltonian of the system composed of internal states of ions, the vibrational state\nof center of mass and the state of standing wave cavity field is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n1\n~\u03c90 X (j)\n\u01240 = ~\u03bd \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 +\n+ ~\u03c9c b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 +\n\u03c3\u0302 ,\n2\n2 j=1 z\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u00e2\u2020 (\u00e2) and b\u0302\u2020 (b\u0302) are the creation(annihilation) operators for vibrational phonons and cavity field photons,\n(j)\nrespectively. Eigen states of Pauli operator \u03c3\u0302z model the internal states of the j th two-level ion (j = 1, 2, 3)\nP3\n(j)\nwith energy splitting ~\u03c90 . We define the total spin operators as \u03c3\u0302k = j=1 \u03c3\u0302k , where k = (z, +, \u2212) and use the\neigenvectors of \u03c3\nb2 and \u03c3\u0302Ez to represent the three ion internal states. The ionic internal states in product basis are\n(1) (2) (3)\n(j)\nlabelled as \u03c3z \u03c3z \u03c3z\n(\u03c3z = \u22121 or +1)). The coupled basis vectors are |\u03c3, \u03c3z i, where the label \u03c3(= 2s) refers to\n\nthe eigenvalue of \u03c3 2 given by \u03c3(\u03c3 + 2). The computational basis states, on the other hand, read as |i1 , i2 , i3 i , where\nij = 0 for atom in ground state and ij = 1 for atom in the excited state.\nThe interaction of cold ions, located at the node of the standing wave, with the quantized cavity field is given by\n\n\f3\n\n\u0124I = ~g(\u03c3\u0302+ + \u03c3\u0302\u2212 )(b\u0302\u2020 + b\u0302) sin[\u03b7(\u00e2\u2020 + \u00e2)],\n\n(2)\n\ng being the ion-cavity coupling constant and \u03b7 the Lamb-Dicke\nparameter.\nThe interaction picture Hamiltonian\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6\nobtained by applying the unitary transformation UI = exp \u2212i\u01240 t/~ is a complex looking operator [30]. However,\n\nwith the cavity coupled to red sideband of ionic vibrational motion (\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9c = \u03bd ), the relevant part of \u0124I in the\nrotating-wave approximation and Lamb-Dicke limit (\u03b7 \u226a 1) reduces to\n\u0124II = ~g\u03b7[\u03c3\u0302+ b\u0302\u00e2 + \u03c3\u0302\u2212 b\u0302\u2020 \u00e2\u2020 ].\n\n(3)\n\nThe possible values of \u03c3 for three ions are 3, 1, 1, there being two distinct internal configurations that allow \u03c3 = 1.\nThe matrix T that transforms from the computational basis to the coupled basis is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\n1\n1\n1\n\uf8ec0 \u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n3\n3\n3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1\n\uf8ec 0 0 0 \u221a1\n\u221a\n\u221a1 0 \uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n3\n3\n3\n\uf8ec0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nq\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2\nT = \uf8ec 0 \u221a1 \u221a1\n.\n(4)\n0 \u2212 3 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n6\n6 q\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121 \u221a\n\uf8ec0 0 0\n\u221a\n0\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n3\n6\n6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1\n\u22121\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2\n2\n\u22121\n\u221a1\n\u221a\n0\n0 0 0\n0\n0\n2\n2\nThe computational basis vectors are taken in the order |000i, |100i, |010i, |110i,|001i, |101i, |011i, and |111i, while\nthe ordering of coupled basis vectors is |3, \u22123i, |3, \u22121i, |3, 1i, |3, 3i, |1, \u22121i1 , |1, 1i1 , |1, \u22121i2 , |1, 1i2 . The subscript in\n|1, \u00b11i1,2 distinguishes the states with same value of \u03c3 but different internal configurations.\nThe product state of the composite system looks like |\u03c3, \u03c3z i\u2297|m, ni, where m is the number of center of mass\nvibrational quanta and n is the number of cavity field photons.

The initial state preparation in\nthis case involves cooling the center of mass motion to zero phonon mode with ions in ground state and the cavity in\nvacuum state.

Entangled cavity photons can transport information to a remote cavity in a fast\nand reliable way. For analyzing the entanglement dynamics, we consider the (m + 1 \u2212 i) phonons and (n + 1 \u2212 i)\nphotons to constitute a single quantum system in the space spanned by vectors |ii (i = 0 to 3), where |ii represents\nthe state |m + 1 \u2212 i, n + 1 \u2212 ii. Furthermore, the ground and excited state of an ion represent logical bits |0i and |1i ,\nrespectively. The composite state of Eq. (13), in logical basis, reads as\n\u0013\n|1001i + |0101i + |0011i\n\u221a\n\u03a8m+1,n+1 (t) = a0 (t)|0000i + a1 (t)\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|1102i + |1012i + |0112i\n\u221a\n+ a3 (t)|1113i.\n+a2 (t)\n3\n\u0012\n\n(31)\n\nLabelling the three ions as A, B, C and cavity field plus phonon state as subsystem D, the possible bipartite partitions\nof the system are A \u2212 BCD, B \u2212 ACD, C \u2212 ABD, D \u2212 ABC, AB \u2212 CD, AC \u2212 BD, and AD \u2212 BC. We notice\nthat the ionic state is symmetrical with respect to interchange of a pair of qubits. As such distinct partitions are\nreduced to A \u2212 BCD, D \u2212 ABC, and AB \u2212 CD. The state is in bi-orthogonal Schmidt form for qubits A, B, C\nand subsystem D. Quantifying or even detecting the entanglement of the composite system with four subsystems is a\nfairly complex task. The four subsystems may have four-partite GHZ state like correlations, or 4-partite entanglement\nresulting from bipartite entanglement between the subsystems. On tracing over anyone of the subsystems, 4-party\nGHZ like entanglement is destroyed, but the three remaining subsystems may have tripartite GHZ like entanglement\nor W-like entanglement. While the GHZ-like tripartite entanglement is completely destroyed on tracing over one\nsubsystem out of the three, the reduced bipartite mixed state may still have bipartite entanglement (provided that\nthe tripartite system had W-like entanglement). The entanglement distribution in the pure state of the composite\nsystem determines the entanglement available simultaneously to all the four parties, three selected parties or a pair\nof subsystems. In particular, the nature, distribution and dynamics of entanglement involving the memory qubits\n(trapped ions ABC) and photons is of special interest if the system is part of a quantum network.\nA. Peres [24] was the first to observe that a partial transpose of density matrix associated with a separable state of\na bipartite system is still a valid density matrix and thus positive (semi) definite. Horodecki et al. [25] proved that a\n\n\f9\npositive partial transpose (PPT) was a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of a state if the dimension\nof the Hilbert space does not exceed six. A negative partial transpose is a clear signature of entanglement. Negativity\n[21, 22, 23] based on Peres Horodecki PPT criterion has been shown to be an entanglement monotone [26]. In a\nrecent article [28], we introduced 2\u2212way and 3\u2212way negativities to discuss the entanglement of three qubit states.\nIn refs. [27, 29], a characterization of multipartite quantum states having N subsystems, based on partial K\u2212way\nnegativities has been proposed. The K\u2212way partial transpose with respect to a subsystem is constructed from the state\noperator by imposing specific constraints on the matrix elements involving the states of K subsystems of multipartite\ncomposite system. It has been shown that the partial transpose of density matrix of an N-partite system, with respect\nto a given subsystem, can be written as a sum of K\u2212way partial transposes where 2 \u2264 K \u2264 N . Contribution to\nnegativity due to a K\u2212way partial transpose is easily calculated. The K\u2212way negativity (2 \u2264 K \u2264 N ), defined as\nthe negativity of K\u2212way partial transpose, quantifies the K\u2212way coherences of the composite system. In contrast\nwith the entropic measures of entanglement, where a reduced state operator is used to obtain information about\nthe correlations between parts of a composite system, the partial K\u2212way negativities are calculated from the state\noperator of the composite system itself. The negativity of global partial transpose remains invariant under local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC), however, the partial K\u2212way negativities may increase or decrease\nunder LOCC at the cost of each other. The partial K\u2212way negativities show the entanglement distribution in different\nparts of the system in a given state. While the total entanglement in a composite system can not be increased by\nlocal operations, the entanglement distribution can be changed by local operations. In this section we investigate the\nentanglement dynamics of the composite system state by using the global negativity to detect the entanglement, and\npartial K\u2212way negativities to determine the entanglement distribution amongst different subsystems.\nA.\n\nDefinition of Global and K\u2212way negativities\n\nThe global partial transpose \u03c1bTGA of four-party state operator \u03c1bABCD = |\u03a8i h\u03a8| with respect to subsystem A is\nconstructed by using the condition\nhi1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bTGA |j1 j2 j3 j4 i = hj1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bABCD |i1 j2 j3 j4 i .\n\nThe K\u2212way partial transpose (2 \u2264 K \u2264 4) of state operator \u03c1bABCD with respect to subsystem A is defined as\nif\n\nand\n\nhi1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bTKA |j1 j2 j3 j4 i = hj1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bABCD |i1 j2 j3 j4 i\n\nif\n\nwhere\n\nhi1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bTKA |j1 j2 j3 j4 i = hi1 i2 i3 i4 | \u03c1bABCD |j1 j2 j3 j4 i\n\u0014\n\n\u03b4im ,jm = 1 for im = jm\n.\n\u03b4im ,jm = 0 for im 6= jm\n\nN\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4im ,jm ) = K,\n\nN\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4im ,jm ) 6= K,\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nm=1\n\nm=1\n\n(34)\n\nSimilar constraints are applied to construct global and K\u2212way partial transpose with respect to subsystems B, C or\nD.

(23))\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|1001i + |0101i + |0011i\n\u221a\n,\n(63)\n\u03a81,n+1 (t) = a0 (t)|0000i + a1 (t)\n3\nallows only bipartite entanglement. For m \u2265 2, the composite system may have genuine 4-partite, tripartite as well\nas bipartite entanglement. This is an interesting aspect unique to systems where vibrational motion of ions is coupled\nto cavity field.\n\n\f15\n\nAB\nFIG. 7: The global negativity NG\nversus \u03c4 (= g\u03b7t) for the initial states |0000i and |1113i.\n\nV.\n\nWHAT DO THE K\u2212WAY NEGATIVITIES ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE SYSTEM?\n\nFigures (3-7) show the entanglement distribution between possible entanglement modes available to the system in\nstates \u03a833 (t) and \u03a600 (t). Since analytical expressions for partial K\u2212way negativities are available for specific initial\nstate preparations, the rate of change of partial K\u2212way negativity for a particular mode can be easily obtained, if\nneeded. The two way partial negativity is seen to grow at the fastest rate being the first to reach it's peak value,\nfollowed by two peaks showing maxima of partial 3\u2212way and 4\u2212way negativities, respectively. Besides that a reversible\nentanglement exchange between different entanglement modes is observed. In Fig. (3) at the maxima of partial 4\u2212way\nnegativity, partial 2\u2212way and 3\u2212way negativities are rather small, whereas the minima of E4A correspond to a large\ncontribution to total entanglement from bipartite and genuine tripartite entanglement. Similar trend is seen in Figures\n(4-6). Figure (7) complements the information about entanglement distribution obtained from Figures (1-6). Once\nthe interaction is switched on, a typical qubit pair is found to be in an entangled state until the composite becomes\nseparable again. As seen from the global negativity plots, the period after which the composite system becomes\n3\u03c0\nseparable is given by T = 4g\u03b7\n.\nW2\n1\nIn particular, we look at the entanglement of states \u03a8W\nm+1,n+1 (Eq. (18)) and \u03a6m\u22122,n\u22122 (Eq. (22)). For both types\nD\nD\nof states NG = E3 , that is there no genuine four partite entanglement amongst the subsystems A, B, C and D. The\nglobal negativities are however finite for A, B, C, D as well as AB, pointing to four partite entanglement. Although\nfor qubits A, B, and C we get finite partial 2\u2212way negativities, four partite entanglement cannot be due to two-way\ncorrelations because E2D = 0. The 2\u2212way negativity of the partial transpose of W1 state or W2 state is 0.94, where\nas the three way negativity is zero. As such a W state is a state with maximal tripartite entanglement generated\nW2\n1\nby 2\u2212way correlations. In states \u03a8W\nm+1,n+1 and \u03a6m\u22122,n\u22122 ions in a W like state are entangled to subsystem D. We\nconclude that the four-partite entanglement of three ions with photon-phonon system is generated by 2\u2212way and\n3\u2212way correlations.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied the entanglement dynamics of spatially separated three two-level cold trapped ions in a high\nfinesse cavity with the cavity tuned to the red sideband of ionic vibrational motion. Analytical expressions for the\nstate of composite system as a function of interaction time are obtained for interaction Hamiltonian of Eq. 3 with\n\n\f16\nthe cavity prepared initially in different photon number states. With three ions initially in their ground state, the\nstate |000, m + 1, n + 1i evolves (i) for m = 0 and n \u2265 0, in a bi-dimensional subspace , (ii) for m = 1 and n \u2265 1\nin a tridimensional subspace, and (iii) for m \u2265 2 and n \u2265 2 in a four-dimensional subspace of the coupled basis\nionic states. The initial state |111, m + 1, n + 1i always evolves in a four-dimensional subspace independent of the\ninitial phonon and photon number. The number of initial state vibrational quanta offers a control mechanism for\nmanipulation of composite system states, when ions are in their ground state initially. This is an interesting aspect\nunique to systems where vibrational motion of ions is coupled to cavity field in contrast to the ions coupled only to\nquantized cavity field [33], [34] or only with the vibrational modes [35]. Useful practical applications to implement\ninformation processing and communication related tasks, can benefit from this special feature. The reduced three\nion state operator is obtained by tracing out the phonon and photon degrees of freedom. For cavity ion coupling\nstrength g = 8.95 MHz, Lamb Dicke parameter value \u03b7 = 0.01 and cavity prepared in single photon state at t = 0, the\nminimum interaction time needed generate a three ion W-state is found to be \u223c 10.133\u03bc sec. For the initial state in\nwhich three ions are in their ground state and center of mass in two phonon state, the W2 state generation probability\nincreases while the minimum interaction time to get the probability peak decreases, with increase in the number of\nphotons present in the cavity at t = 0.\nThe ionic qubits in W state are found to be entangled to cavity photons, that may be used to transport information\nto a remote cavity in a fast and reliable way. Multipartite entanglement dynamics of the composite system is examined\nusing global, four-way, three-way and two-way negativities. Analytical expressions for partial K\u2212way negativities\n(K = 2 to 4) are obtained. For the three ions prepared initially in their ground state or in their excited state, the partial\nK\u2212way negativities are calculated numerically and plotted as a function of interaction parameter. These plots show\nthe entanglement distribution as well as the rate of change with time of entanglement between possible entanglement\nmodes available to the system. Besides that reversible entanglement exchange between different entanglement modes\nis observed. For specific values of interaction parameter, the three ions and photon-phonon system are found to\nhave four partite entanglement, generated by 2\u2212way and 3\u2212way correlations. Three ions in W state are found to\nbe entangled to photons. We expect this analysis to add to the understanding of multipartite entanglement in the\ncontext of trapped ions interacting with photons in optical cavities.\n\nAcknowledgments\nS. S.
