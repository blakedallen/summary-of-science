On the one hand, it includes the\nseesaw mechanism, which postulates the existence of right-handed neutrino\nfields and has become the most popular framework to account for neutrino\nmasses. The seesaw is able to accommodate the experimental data on neutrino masses and mixing [1], explaining naturally the small neutrino mass\nscale. On the other hand, it embraces low energy supersymmetry, with its\nrich phenomenology and its well known virtues. In fact, the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model solves the hierarchy problem, achieves the\nunification of the gauge couplings, and contains a dark matter candidate:\nthe lightest supersymmetric particle.\nThe lightest sneutrino is a new dark matter candidate present in the\nsupersymmetric seesaw. Being a mixture of left-handed and right-handed\nsneutrino fields, the lightest sneutrino will have different properties depending on its composition in terms of interactions eigenstates. In general, three\ndifferent kind of sneutrinos can be envisioned: a dominantly left-handed one,\na mixed sneutrino, or a dominantly right-handed one. A dominantly lefthanded sneutrino is not a good dark matter candidate. They are ruled out\nby experimental searches [2] and tend to have a too small relic density [3]. A\nmixed sneutrino can be compatible with the observed dark matter density as\nwell as with present bounds from direct searches [4, 5]. The required mixing\nis obtained at the expense of a large neutrino trilinear coupling, which is not\nallowed in typical models of supersymmetry breaking. A dominantly righthanded sneutrino is the final possibility, the one we will be concerned with\nthroughout this paper. A right-handed sneutrino, being essentially sterile,\ninteracts with other particles mainly through the neutrino Yukawa coupling.\nCould such a sterile sneutrino account for the observed dark matter density?\nGopalakrishna, Gouvea, and Porod, in [6], studied that possibility within\nthe same scenario we are considering here. They showed that self-annihilations\nof right-handed sneutrinos as well as co-annihilations with other particles are\ntoo weak to keep the sneutrinos in equilibrium with the thermal plasma in\nthe early Universe. They also found that the production of sneutrinos in\nthe decay of other supersymmetric particles gives a too large contribution\nto the relic density. They concluded, therefore, that in the standard cosmological model right-handed sneutrinos cannot explain the dark matter of the\nUniverse.\n1\n\n\fEven though generally valid, that conclusion is not guaranteed if the\nmass difference between the Higgsino and the sneutrino is small. In that\ncase, inverse decays, such as \u00d1 + L \u2192 H\u0303, contribute to the annihilation of\nsneutrinos and therefore to the reduction of the sneutrino relic density. Such\npossibility was not taken into account in [6]. In this paper, we will focus\non models with a Higgsino NLSP and show that inverse processes cannot\nbe neglected, for they suppress the sneutrino relic density by several orders\nof magnitude. Then, we will reexamine whether the sterile sneutrino can\nexplain the dark matter of the Universe in the standard cosmological model.\nIn the next section we briefly review the supersymmetric seesaw model\nand show that sterile sneutrinos arise naturally in common scenarios of supersymmetry breaking. Then, in section 3, we will include inverse decays\ninto the Boltzmann equation that determines the sneutrino abundance. It\nis then shown that inverse decays are indeed relevant; they cause a significant reduction of the relic density. In section 4, we study the relic density\nas a function of the neutrino Yukawa coupling, the sneutrino mass, and the\nHiggsino-sneutrino mass difference. There, we will obtain our main result:\nthe suppression effect of inverse decays, though important, is not enough to\nbring the sneutrino relic density down within the observed range. In the final\nsection we will review our study and present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nWe work within the supersymmetric version of the seesaw mechanism, where\nthe field content of the MSSM is supplemented with a right-handed neutrino\nsuperfield N per generation. The superpotential then reads\n1\nW = WM SSM + MNIJ N I N J + Y\u03bdIJ Hu LI N J\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, as usual, we have assumed R-parity conservation and renormalizability. MN is the Majorana mass matrix of right-handed neutrinos and Y\u03bd is\nthe matrix of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Without loss of generality MN\ncan be chosen to be real and diagonal. Y\u03bd is in general complex but we will\nassume, for simplicity, that it is real. MN and Y\u03bd are new free parameters\nof the model; they are to be determined or constrained from experimental\ndata.\n\n2\n\n\fAfter electroweak symmetry breaking, the above superpotential generates\nthe following neutrino mass terms\n1\nL\u03bd mass = \u2212vu Y\u03bd \u03bdN \u2212 MN NN + h.c.\n2\n\n(2)\n\nIf MN \u226b vu Y\u03bd , the light neutrino mass matrix, m\u03bd , is then given by the\nseesaw formula\nm\u03bd = \u2212mD MN\u22121 mTD ,\n(3)\nwith mD = vu Y\u03bd being the Dirac mass. Since m\u03bd is partially known from\nneutrino oscillation data, equation (3) is actually a constraint on the possible\nvalues of Y\u03bd and MN . It is a weak constraint though; and it allows MN to\nvary over many different scales. In this paper we consider what is usually\nknown as a seesaw mechanism at the electroweak scale. That is, we assume\nthat MN \u223c 100 GeV. Thus, since the neutrino mass scale is around m\u03bd \u223c 0.1\neV, the typical neutrino Yukawa coupling is\nY\u03bd \u223c 10\u22126 ,\n\n(4)\n\nor around the same order of magnitude as the electron Yukawa coupling.\nNotice that this value of Y\u03bd is a consequence of the seesaw mechanism at the\nelectroweak scale. In other frameworks, such as Dirac neutrinos or seesaw\nat much higher energies, Y\u03bd takes different values. We will not consider such\npossibilities here.\nThe new soft-breaking terms of the supersymmetric seesaw model are\ngiven by\ni\nh\nI J\nh\nL\u0303\n\u00d1\n+\nh.c.\n.\n(5)\nLsof t = \u2212(m2N )IJ \u00d1R\u2217I \u00d1RJ + (m2B )IJ \u00d1RI \u00d1RJ \u2212 AIJ\nu\n\u03bd\nR\nThey include sneutrino mass terms as well a trilinear interaction term. For\nsimplicity, we will assume that m2N , m2B , and A\u03bd are real.\nTo study the sneutrino mass terms resulting from (1) and (5) it is convenient to suppress the generation structure; that is, to work with one fermion\ngeneration only. It is also useful to introduce the real fields \u03bd\u03031 , \u03bd\u03032 , \u00d11 and\n\u00d12 according to the relations\n\u0011\n1\n1 \u0010\n\u03bd\u0303L = \u221a (\u03bd\u03031 + i\u03bd\u03032 ) , \u00d1R = \u221a \u00d11 + i\u00d12 .\n(6)\n2\n2\n3\n\n\fIndeed, in the basis (\u03bd\u03031 , \u00d11 , \u03bd\u03032 , \u00d12 ) the sneutrino mass matrix takes a block\ndiagonal form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nm2LL\nm2RL + mD MN\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec m2RL + mD M\nm2RR \u2212 m2B\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\nM\u03bd\u0303 = \uf8ec\n2\n2\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\nmLL\nmRL \u2212 mD MN \uf8f8\n0\n0\nm2RL \u2212 mD MN\nm2RR + m2B\n(7)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere mLL = mL\u0303 + mD + 0.5mZ cos 2\u03b2, mRR = MN + mN + mD , and mLR =\n\u2212\u03bcvd YN + vu A\u03bd . This matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary rotation with\na mixing angle given by\n\u03bd\u0303\ntan 2\u03b81,2\n=\n\n2(m2RL \u00b1 mD M)\n,\nm2LL \u2212 (m2RR \u2213 m2B )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the top sign corresponds to \u03b81 \u2013to the mixing between \u03bd\u03031 and \u00d11 \u2013\nwhereas the bottom sign corresponds to \u03b82 .\nSince M\u03bd\u0303 is independent of gaugino masses, there is a region in the\nsupersymmetric parameter space where the lightest sneutrino, obtained from\n(7), is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and consequently the dark\nmatter candidate. That is the only region we will consider in this paper.\nThe lightest sneutrino is a mixture of left-handed and right-handed sneutrino fields. Depending on its gauge composition, three kinds of sneutrinos\ncan be distinguished: a dominantly left-handed sneutrino, a mixed sneutrino,\nand a dominantly right-handed sneutrino. A dominantly left-handed sneutrino is not a good dark matter candidate for it is already ruled out by direct\ndark matter searches. These sneutrinos also have large interactions cross sections and tend to annihilate efficiently in the early universe, typically yielding\na too small relic density. A mixed sneutrino may be a good dark matter candidate. By adjusting the sneutrino mixing angle, one can simultaneously\nsuppress its annihilation cross section, so as to obtain the right relic density,\nand the sneutrino-nucleon cross section, so as to evade present constraints\nfrom direct searches. A detailed study of models with mixed sneutrino dark\nmatter was presented recently in [5]. A major drawback of these models is\nthat the required mixing may be incompatible with certain scenarios of supersymmetry breaking, such as gravity mediation. The third possibility, the\none we consider, is a lightest sneutrino which is predominantly right-handed.\nThat is, a sterile sneutrino.\n4\n\n\fA sterile sneutrino is actually unavoidable in supersymmetry breaking\nscenarios where the trilinear couplings are proportional to the corresponding\nYukawa matrices, such as the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (CMSSM)[1]. In these models\nA\u03bd = a\u03bd Y\u03bd msof t\n\n(9)\n\nwhere msof t \u223c 100 GeV is a typical supersymmetry breaking mass and a\u03bd is\nan order one parameter. Because Y\u03bd is small, A\u03bd is much smaller than the\nelectroweak scale,\nA\u03bd \u223c 100keV .\n(10)\n\nHence, from equation (8), the mixing angle between \u03bd\u0303i and \u00d1i is also very\nsmall\nsin \u03b8i \u223c 10\u22126 .\n(11)\nThus, we see how in these models the small Y\u03bd translates into a small trilinear\ncoupling A\u03bd that in turn leads to a small mixing angle \u2013to a sterile sneutrino.\nSterile sneutrinos are also expected in other supersymmetry breaking mechanisms that yield a small A\u03bd at the electroweak scale.\nSince the mixing angle is small, we can extract the sterile neutrino mass\ndirectly from (7). It is given by\nm2\u00d1 = m2RR \u2212 m2B \u2248 MN2 + m2N \u2212 m2B\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we have neglected the Dirac mass term in the last expression. m\u00d1\nis thus expected to be at the electroweak scale. In the following, we will\nconsider m\u00d1 = mLSP as a free parameter of the model.\nTo summarize, the models we study consist of the MSSM plus an electroweak scale seesaw mechanism that accounts for neutrino masses. Such\nmodels include a new dark matter candidate: the lightest sneutrino. In common scenarios of supersymmetry breaking, the lightest sneutrino, which we\nassume to be the dark matter candidate, turns out to be a dominantly right\nhanded sneutrino, or a sterile sneutrino. In the following, we will examine\nwhether such a sterile sneutrino may account for the dark matter of the\nUniverse.\n\n3\n\nThe \u00d1 relic density\n\nTo determine whether the sterile sneutrino can explain the dark matter of\nthe universe we must compute its relic density \u03a9\u00d1 h2 and compare it with\n5\n\n\fthe observed value \u03a9DM h2 = 0.11[8]. This question was already addressed in\n[6]. They showed that, due to their weak interactions, sneutrinos are unable\nto reach thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. In fact, both the selfannihilation and the co-annihilation cross section are very suppressed. They\nalso noticed that sneutrinos could be produced in the decays of other supersymmetric particles and found that such decay contributions lead to a relic\ndensity several orders of magnitude larger than observed. Thus, they concluded, sterile sneutrinos can only be non-thermal dark matter candidates.\nThat conclusion was drawn, however, without taking into account inverse\ndecay processes. We now show that if the Higgsino-sneutrino mass difference\nis small1 , inverse decays may suppress the sneutrino relic density by several\norders of magnitude. To isolate this effect, only models with a Higgsino\nNLSP are considered in the following. We then reexamine the possibility\nof having a sterile sneutrino as a thermal dark matter candidate within the\nstandard cosmological model.\nIn the early Universe, sterile sneutrinos are mainly created through the\ndecay H\u0303 \u2192 \u00d1 + L, where H\u0303 is the Higgsino and L is the lepton doublet.\nAlternatively, using the mass-eigenstate language, one may say that sneutrinos are created in the decay of neutralinos (\u03c70 \u2192 \u00d1 + \u03bd) and charginos\n(\u03c7\u00b1 \u2192 l\u00b1 + \u00d1 ). These decays are all controlled by the neutrino Yukawa\ncoupling Y\u03bd . Other decays, such as l\u0303 \u2192 \u00d1 f f \u2032 via W \u00b1 , also occur but the\nHiggsino channel dominates. Regarding annihilation processes, the most important one is the inverse decay \u00d1 + L \u2192 H\u0303. In fact, the sneutrino-sneutrino\nannihilation cross section is so small that such process never reaches equilibrium. And a similar result holds for the sneutrino coannihilation cross\nsection. We can therefore safely neglect annihilations and coannihilations in\nthe following. Only decays and inverse decays contribute to the sneutrino\nrelic density.\nThe Boltzmann equation for the sneutrino distribution function f\u00d1 then\nreads:\nZ\n\u2202f\u00d1\n|p|2 \u2202f\u00d1\n1\nd 3 pL\nd3 pH\u0303\n\u2212H\n=\n|MH\u0303\u2192L\u00d1 |2\n(13)\n\u2202t\nE \u2202E\n2E\u00d1 (2\u03c0)3 2EL (2\u03c0)3 2EH\u0303\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b4 4 (pH\u0303 \u2212 pL \u2212 p\u00d1 ) [fH\u0303 \u2212 fL f\u00d1 ]\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter and fH\u0303 , fL respectively denote the H\u0303 and\nL distribution functions. Other dark matter candidates, including the neu1\n\nIf it is large the results in [6] would follow.\n\n6\n\n\ftralino, have large elastic scatterings cross sections with the thermal plasma\nthat keep them in kinetic equilibrium during the freeze out process. Their\ndistribution functions are then proportional to those in chemical equilibrium\nand the Boltzmann equation can be written as an equation for the number\ndensity instead of the distribution function [9]. For sterile sneutrinos, on\nthe contrary, the elastic scattering is a slow process \u2013being suppressed by\nthe Yukawa coupling\u2013 and kinetic equilibrium is not guaranteed. Hence, we\ncannot write (13) as an equation for the sneutrino number density n\u00d1 and\nmust instead solve it for f\u00d1 .\nIf the condition f\u00d1 \u226a 1 were satisfied, inverse processes could be neglected and a simple equation relating the sneutrino number density to the\nHiggsino number density could be obtained. That is the case, for instance, in\nsupersymmetric scenarios with Dirac mass terms only [7]. In such models, the\nneutrino Yukawa coupling is very small, Y\u03bd \u223c 10\u221213 , and sneutrinos never\nreach chemical equilibrium. But for the range of parameters we consider,\nY\u03bd \u223c 10\u22126 , the condition f\u00d1 \u226a 1 is not satisfied.\nSince equation (13) depends also on the Higgsino distribution function,\none may think that it is necessary to write the Boltzmann equation for fH\u0303\nand then solve the resulting system for f\u00d1 and fH\u0303 . Not so. Higgsinos, due to\ntheir gauge interactions, are kept in thermal equilibrium \u2013by self-annihilation\nprocesses\u2013 until low temperatures, when they decay into \u00d1 +L through the Y\u03bd\nsuppressed interaction. It is thus useful to define a freeze-out temperature,\nTf.o. , as the temperature at which these two reaction rates become equal.\nThat is,\nnH\u0303 h\u03c3H\u0303 H\u0303 vi|Tf.o. = \u0393(H\u0303 \u2192 \u00d1 + L)|Tf.o. ,\n(14)\nwhere nH\u0303 is the Higgsino number density and h\u03c3H\u0303 H\u0303 vi is the thermal average of the Higgsino-Higgsino annihilation rate into light particles. Tf.o.\nmarks the boundary between two different regimes. For T > Tf.o. Higgsinos\nare in equilibrium and annihilate efficiently. The Higgsinos produced in the\ninverse decays, in particular, easily annihilate with thermal Higgsinos into\nlight particles. The inverse process is thus effective. In contrast, for T < Tf.o.\nHiggsinos mostly decay into the LSP and inverse decays cannot deplete the\nsneutrino abundance. The final state Higgsinos simply decay back into sneutrinos: \u00d1 + L \u2192 H\u0303 \u2192 \u00d1 + L. Below Tf.o. , therefore, the total number of\nsneutrinos plus Higgsinos remains constant. Thus, we only need to integrate\nequation (15) until Tf.o. , a region in which Higgsinos are in equilibrium.\nAssuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, f (E) \u221d exp(\u2212E/T ), for\n7\n\n\fHiggsinos and leptons and neglecting lepton masses, the integrals in (13) can\nbe evaluated analytically to find\n\u0001\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202f\u03bd\u0303\n|p|2 \u2202f\u03bd\u0303\n|MH\u0303\u2192L\u00d1 |2 T \u2212E /T\ne \u00d1 \u2212 f\u00d1 e\u2212E\u2212 /T \u2212 e\u2212E+ /T\n\u2212H\n=\n\u2202t\nE \u2202E\n16\u03c0E\u00d1 |p\u00d1 |\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\nE\u00b1 =\n\nm2H\u0303 \u2212 m2\u00d1\n(E\u00d1 \u00b1 |p\u00d1 |).\n2m2\u00d1\n\n(16)\n\nIn the following we will solve equation (15) to obtain the sneutrino abundance, Y\u00d1 = n\u00d1 /s, and the sneutrino relic density, \u03a9\u00d1 h2 . The sneutrino\nabundance today will be given by\nY\u00d1 |T0 = Y\u00d1 |Tf.o. + YH\u0303 |Tf.o. ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the second term takes into account that the Higgsinos present at freezeout will decay into sneutrinos. The sneutrino relic density today is then\nobtained as\nm\u00d1\n.\n(18)\n\u03a9\u00d1 h2 = 2.8 \u00d7 1010 Y\u00d1\n100GeV\nThe only parameters that enter directly in the computation of the sneutrino\nrelic density are the Yukawa coupling, the sneutrino mass, and the Higgsino\nmass, which we take to be given by the \u03bc parameter \u2013mH\u0303 = \u03bc. All other\nsupersymmetric particles besides \u00d1 and H\u0303 are assumed to be heavier, with\nmsusy \u223c 1 TeV. To determine the freeze-out temperature, equation (14), we\nalso need to know the Higgsino annihilation rate into Standard Model particles. We use the DarkSUSY package [10] to extract that value. Regarding\nthe initial conditions, we assume that at high temperatures (T \u226b mH\u0303 ) the\nsneutrino distribution function is negligible f\u00d1 \u223c 0. Finally, we assume that\nthe early Universe is described by the standard cosmological model.\nOnce decays and inverse decays are included in the \u00d1 Boltzmann equation, two questions naturally come to mind. First, for what values of Y\u03bd are\ninverse decays relevant? Second, can decays and inverse decays bring the\nsneutrinos into equilibrium? To answer these questions we show in figure\n1 the sneutrino abundance as a function of the temperature for m\u00d1 = 100\nGeV, mH\u0303 = 120 GeV, and different values of Y\u03bd . Notice that for Y\u03bd = 10\u22128\ninverse processes are negligible and the sneutrino abundance simply grows\nwith temperature. In that region, for Y\u03bd . 10\u22128 , the sneutrino relic density\n8\n\n\f1\nmLSP = 100 GeV, \u2206m = 20 GeV\n0.01\n\nY\n\n0.0001\n\n1e-06\nEquilibrium\nY\u03bd = 1e-4\nY\u03bd = 1e-5\nY\u03bd = 1e-6\nY\u03bd = 1e-7\nY\u03bd = 1e-8\n\n1e-08\n\n1e-10\n\n1\n\n10\nTemperature (GeV)\n\n100\n\nFigure 1: The role of the neutrino Yukawa coupling on the sterile sneutrino abundance. The figure shows Y as a function of the temperature for different values of\nY\u03bd . The sneutrino mass is 100GeV while \u03bc = 120GeV.\n\nis proportional to Y\u03bd2 . From the figure we see that for Y\u03bd = 10\u22127 the inverse process leads to a reduction of the sneutrino abundance around T = 20\nGeV. The Yukawa interaction is not yet strong enough to bring the sneutrinos into equilibrium. For Y\u03bd = 10\u22126 sneutrinos do reach equilibrium and\nthen decouple at lower temperatures. For even larger Yukawa couplings,\nY\u03bd = 10\u22125 , 10\u22124, equilibrium is also reached but the decoupling occurs at\nhigher temperatures. In that region, the relic density also increases with the\nYukawas. Thus, for Y\u03bd \u223c 10\u22126 inverse decays not only are relevant, they are\nstrong enough to thermalize the sneutrinos.\nFigure 2 directly compares the resulting sneutrino abundance with and\nwithout including the inverse process. The full line corresponds to the correct\nresult, taking into account the direct and the inverse process. The dashed\nline, instead, shows the result for the direct process only, that is the sneutrino\nabundance according to [6].

Notice that the correct final\nabundance, and consequently the resulting relic density, is always several\norders of magnitude below the value predicted in [6]. Even for the case of a\nlarge mass difference, we find a suppression of 3 orders of magnitude in the\nrelic density. And as the mass difference shrinks the suppression becomes\nlarger, reaching about 6 orders of magnitude for \u03bc = 150 and about 7 orders\nof magnitude for \u03bc = 120GeV. We thus see that over the whole parameter\nspace the inverse process has a large suppression effect on the sneutrino relic\ndensity.\n\n10\n\n\fmLSP = 100 GeV\nmLSP = 200 GeV\nmLSP = 300 GeV\nmLSP = 400 GeV\n\n1e+06\n\n\u03a9h\n\n2\n\n10000\n\n100\n\n1\n\n\u2206m = 20 GeV\n\n1e-07\n\n1e-06\nNeutrino Yukawa Coupling\n\n1e-05\n\nFigure 3: The sneutrino relic density as a function of the neutrino Yukawa coupling\nfor different values of m\u00d1 and \u2206m = 20GeV.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\nSo far we have found that the inverse decay process \u00d1 + L \u2192 H\u0303 leads to a\nsuppression of the sneutrino relic density. It remains to be seen whether such\nsuppression is strong enough to bring the relic density down to the observed\nvalue. That is, we will now study the dependence of the relic density with\nthe sneutrino mass, the Higgsino-sneutrino mass difference, and the neutrino\nYukawa coupling to find the region of the parameter space that satisfies the\ncondition \u03a9\u00d1 h2 = \u03a9DM h2 .\nFigure 3 shows the sneutrino relic density as a function of the neutrino\nYukawa coupling and different values of the sneutrino mass. The Higgsinosneutrino mass difference (\u2206m = mH\u0303 \u2212m\u00d1 ) was set to 20 GeV. Larger values\nwould only increase the relic density \u2013see figure 2. Notice that, for a given\nsneutrino mass, the relic density initially decreases rather steeply reaching\na minimum value at Y\u03bd . 10\u22126 and then increases again.

As expected the smaller the mass\ndifference the smaller the relic density is.\n\nmH\u0303 = 400 GeV, that is, when the percentage mass difference is smaller. In\nany case, the relic density is always larger than 1, too large to be compatible\nwith the observations.\nThis result is confirmed in figure 4 when we display the relic density\nas a function of the sneutrino mass for Y\u00d1 = 10\u22126 and different values of\n\u2206m/m. In agreement with the previous figure, we see that the smaller\nthe percentage mass difference, the smaller the relic density is. Yet, \u03a9\u00d1 h2 is\nalways larger than 1. We have verified that this conclusion is robust. Neither\nlarger sneutrino masses nor different Yukawa couplings lead to the correct\nvalue of the relic density.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe studied the possibility of explaining the dark matter with a sterile sneutrino in a supersymmetric model consisting of the MSSM supplemented with\n12\n\n\fa seesaw mechanism at the weak scale. We showed that if the Higgsino\nis the NLSP inverse decays play a crucial role in the computation of the\nsneutrino relic density, suppressing it for several orders of magnitude. We\nwrote down and numerically solved the correct Boltzmann equation that\ndetermines the sneutrino abundance and studied the resulting relic density\nas a function of the sneutrino mass, the neutrino Yukawa coupling and the\nHiggsino-sneutrino mass difference. We found that the sterile sneutrino relic\ndensity, even though much smaller than previously believed, is still larger\nthan the observed dark matter density. In this scenario, therefore, the sterile\nsneutrino is not a thermal dark matter candidate.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am supported by the Juan de la Cierva program of the Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia of Spain, by Proyecto Nacional FPA2006-01105, and by\nthe Comunidad de Madrid under Proyecto HEPHACOS S-0505/ESP-0346.\nI would like to thank W.
