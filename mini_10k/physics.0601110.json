Introduction\nDuring this year, 2005, the HyperCP collaboration at Fermilab announced a new rare\nparticle at approximately 214 MeV that was found in their data [1]. This find allowed us to\nmodify our Spin Matrix geometry model of the organized part of the quantum vacuum that we\npresented in a previous paper to better fit existing data [2]. Starting with the rest mass energy of\na positron we predict the rest mass energies of the up and down quarks, the \u03c00 meson and now\nthis new X particle at 214 MeV using our geometrical model modified by a fitting function. We\nalso predict other energy states that don't directly relate to elementary particles of the Standard\nModel but they possibly do relate to higher resonances of composites.\nIn this paper we will discuss more details about our Spin Matrix geometrical model and how\nits basic linear geometrical configuration must be modified for higher energy non-linearities. We\nuse the term Dual Spacetime to imagine this concept and Spin Matrix for the organized part of\nthe quantum vacuum that is mostly hidden from us. Our model is much like a modified Dirac\nSea that involves two 3-branes connected by a common 2D surface boundary. This type of\nconcept has become popular in recent years with the advent of the Randall-Sundrum papers [3].\nAnother very important feature of our Spin Matrix geometry is chiral symmetry and how it\nis broken. And maybe a clue to how chiral symmetry is restored at higher energies. It will be\neasy to see that there is a mix of energy states that probably have chiral symmetry and some that\ndon't. But first we need to say that our energy states represented by the circular areas are\ncomposites of fermion / anti-fermion pairs resulting from our perspective that they are much like\nGoldstone bosons with zero overall spin and zero mass. However, we must also take heed to the\nAnyon hypothesis and that some of these energy states might be neither fermionic nor bosonic in\ncontent. Which leads to fractional statistics [4]. For the most part of this letter though, we will\nassume that the content of the energy states to be fermionic / anti-fermionic pairs which ought to\nbehave similar to Cooper pairs from BCS theory [5].\nAnd of course, this Spin Matrix geometry can explain why there is a mass gap in the first\nplace since it only allows certain energy states to exist due to its interactional equilibrium. We\ncan easily see from the geometry that e+e- pairs are the first to come out of the Spin Matrix into\n*\n\nE-mail addresses: fredifizzx@hotmail.com (Diether), inopin@yahoo.com (Inopin).\n\n1\n\n\four spacetime and then pions with respect to first generation particles. We must admit that we\ndon't seem to see the presence of 2nd or 3rd generation fermions in this scenario yet. But we\nexpect that a less trivial geometric scheme must produce them.\n\nII. The Spin Matrix Geometry\nIn the previous paper, we also presented the concept of quantum vacuum charge (QVC) =\n\n\u00b1\n\nc and we showed that it works very well for the bound charge of free space photons [2].\n\nThis is what led us to the concept of the Spin Matrix geometry. For QVC to be a reality, then\nthere must be some kind of quantum mechanism to support it. One naturally thinks of virtual\nfermionic pairs surrounding real charged elementary particles and QVC is an extension of that\nscreening. When we say \"fermionic pair\" we mean with a fermion and anti-fermion of the same\nparticle flavor.\nOur Spin Matrix geometrical model of the quantum vacuum is fairly simple and is based on\nthe idea that the quantum vacuum should have properties that dictate what we see as the real\nelementary particle spectrum. In other words, an organization amidst the quantum chaos. It is\nstrictly two-dimensional and can be seen in the figures that follow. It is basically a Dirac-like\nSea concept except that only certain energy states are allowed by the geometry instead of having\na continuum of possible energy states. Now in thinking of a Dirac Sea concept, we have to\nimagine that the \"Sea\" would have to be composed of \"less than virtual\" (LTV) fermionic pairs.\nOf course this presents the usual problem of where is this sea of LTV fermions? We think it is\nmostly hidden from us on the other side of an event horizon. In other words, there are two 3branes connected by a common 2D surface or event horizon. Our 2D Spin Matrix is the view of\nlooking from our brane into the brane on \"the other side of the looking glass\" on a very\nmicroscopic level. This concept of a sea of LTV fermionic pairs, immediately allows for virtual\nfermionic pairs to exist. Virtual fermionic pairs are simply the state of being between both\n\"worlds\". When we say \"less than virtual\" we mean the set of particles that are in the other\nbrane that we can have no direct contact with because they are beyond the event horizon. This is\nsimilar to the concept that we can have no direct contact with particles that might be in a black\nhole.\nThe dual space-time scenario that we are thinking of would have to be similar to a Dirac Sea\nonly modified so that it can work. And we must turn to cosmology for a more complete\ndescription to help with this. There is really good evidence that there was some kind of Big\nBang event that started our Universe so it is easy to imagine that there is an event horizon that is\nassociated with our Universe's \"now\". This event horizon must be physically moving at c right\nnow. This gives us a necessary boundary between the two spacetimes. And better allows for a\nmodified Dirac Sea concept to work.\nFigure1 shows a two dimensional hexagonal configuration of the Spin Matrix. We can see\nthat this produces areas that are \"isolated\" from each other in the space where the 3.3 MeV\nenergy states form and this immediately brings to mind regions where the \"weak\" and \"strong\"\ninteractions operate. And that higher energy states can form in the smaller spaces. The hexagon\noutlined in Fig.1 would be a \"cell\" of the Spin Matrix. We call this cell a zerton and it should\nhave the property of \u00b1 c for its overall charge. It can also be seen that the electromagnetic\ninteraction is not isolated and this can explain its \"infinite\" range. Whereas the smaller areas,\nbeing isolated from each other, have interactions that are limited in range. It looks like there is\n2\n\n\fthe possibility of tunneling between the isolated regions though. However, the mechanism of\nhow all of this works in our spacetime from the Spin Matrix spacetime needs more explanation.\n\n0.5110 MeV\nLTV e+e-\n\n3.3 MeV\nLTV u-ubar\n\nFig. 1. Hexagonal configuration of the 2D Spin Matrix boundary. If we take the larger areas to be\n0.511 MeV, then the smaller areas shown, geometrically come out to be 3.3 MeV.\n\nAll particles that we consider to be real in our spacetime have to have a connection to the Spin\nMatrix. This connection would be the cloud of virtual pairs that surround all fermions.\nIn Figure 2 we have zoomed in on one of the isolated regions. To calculate the energy of\nthe energy states, we set the radius of the LTV e+ e \u2212 state equal to 1 and then just divide mec2 by\nthe radius of the smaller circles that is calculated from the geometrical relationships to obtain an\nenergy value for them. Basically we are just making a relation of these states using the reduced\nmass formula,\nmred =\n\nm1m2\nm\n=\nwhen m1 = m2 ,\nm1 + m2 2\n\n(1)\n\nsimilar to how a bound state like positronium would be considered so that we can have a value of\nwhat this state might have in relation to a value in our spacetime to a single fermion of the pair.\nFrom our macroscopic perspective, these states really look to have zero energy so we must use a\nmicroscopic perspective by just starting with what the rest mass energy of an electron or positron\nwould be and scale the rest from that. In other words, this is what a real fermion might \"see\"\nwith respect to energy values. The LTV e+ e \u2212 from our perspective is the annihilated state of\npositronium. An example of obtaining the energy for the state of the next smaller circle is that\nwe can calculate the radius of the circle by geometry and we obtain 2 3 / 3 \u2212 1 \u2245 0.15470 . Then\n\nm e c2 /(2 3 / 3 -1) \u2245 3.303 MeV for the result of the next smaller circle. And so on as we go to\nsmaller and smaller sized energy states (actually higher energy). In theory it is possible to obtain\nexact geometrical results. However, because of the quantum nature of the Spin Matrix, we\nwould expect that what we are presenting are average values anywise.\nIn Figure 3, we obtain energy states that are close to a \u03c00 meson and then the HyperCP 214\nMeV X particle. The actual linear geometrical calculations for the \u03c00 meson area is 142.7 MeV\n3\n\n\f0.5110 MeV\n\n23.70 MeV\n14.93 MeV\n\n23.17 MeV\n8.111 MeV\n3.298 MeV\n\nFigure 2.

Further zoom in of small area between the LTV uu and dd quark areas.\n\nand for the HyperCP X is 235.7 MeV. At this point we make the conjecture that these energy\nstates do represent these particles and we apply a \"fitting function\" to adjust the values of the\nSpin Matrix geometry. We will discuss this function more later but basically we think it is\nnecessary because of higher energy non-linearities. So all of the values we have labeled on the\n\n4\n\n\ffigures are the adjusted values. We think this \"fitting\" is due to the concept that the lower\nenergy states are softer and higher energy states are harder so that in reality what we are\nshowing as perfect circles really aren't that perfect in the Spin Matrix quantum mechanism. Of\ncourse we also have the problem to figure out of why the 134.7 MeV state is \"picked out\" to\nrepresent the \u03c00 meson. There must be some defining reason why the uu and dd quarks pick\nthis current path when being excited into our spacetime from the Spin Matrix. We also note that\nwe have an unexplain state of 14.93 MeV in Figure 2. We think this state is a new lightest\nGoldstone state and is yet to be discovered.\n\nIII. The HyperCP 214 MeV X Particle\nRecently He, et al, has published results from HyperCP Collaboration [6]. The striking\nresult is the discovery of a new particle X, with mass of about 214 MeV. The authors claim an X\nto be narrow, short-lived particle, and non-hadronic. They find that existing data on\nK+ \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03bc + \u03bc- rule out a scalar particle or a vector particle as possible explanations. The\nauthors also explored all the existing constraints on pseudoscalar and axial vector particles, and\nconclude that these possibilities are still allowed. Another paper further constrains the HyperCP\nfind to be a pseudoscalar, which we tend to agree with [7].\nOne of the possible interpretations for new X-particle is to be an sgoldstino, a mystical\nobject, which arises in supersymmetrical schemes [1,6,7]. The sgoldstino has spin 0 and it can\nhave mass, although this mass can be quite arbitrary. The sgoldstino is the bosonic superpartner\nfor the goldstino. But there could be different scenarios for such physics, and we will suggest\none of them. We have used our Spin matrix model to calculate masses of inner energy states\noriginating from 2D structure in Figure 1 and found an energy state of the appropriate magnitude\nfor the HyperCP 214 MeV particle lying right next to an energy state that we associate with\npions as can be seen in Fig. 3. Our mass evaluations and predictions are essentially parameterfree.\n\nIV. X-particle Physics\nSome time ago the group of authors \u2013 Akers, Palazzi, and Mac Gregor came up with the socalled \"An Elementary Particle Constituent-Quark Model\"[8]. They compared meson and\nbaryon spectra and found a common mass-band structure, in which particles with a variety of\nquantum numbers are grouped together. These quantized mass values seemingly mandate a\nconstituent-quark (CQ) viewpoint. By studying the meson and baryon yrast states, the authors\ndeduced the masses and spin values of some of the constituent quarks. The authors' basic claim\nis that any baryon or meson mass could be simply expressed in terms of either X1 = 35 MeV or\nX2 = 70 MeV multiple quanta. One can see how nicely Mac Gregor's 70 MeV quanta fits in our\ngeometrical solution (see Fig.3).\nAnother novel model was devised recently by Walcher [9]. This model describes the\npossible existence of narrow excited states in the nucleon sector below the \u03c0N threshold. A\nmodel based on the excitation of collective states of the quark condensate is proposed explaining\nthese states as multiple production of a \"genuine\" Goldstone boson with a mass of \u2248 20 MeV.\nWalcher assumes that the \u03c0 observed in nature is not the Goldstone boson that it is normally\nidentified with, but a mixture of the \"genuine\" Goldstone boson \u03c0G, i.e. the light \u03c0 suggested\nabove consisting of light current quarks, with a \"constituent\" \u03c0c made of constituent quarks with\n5\n\n\fa mass of m\u03c0c = 2mc = 700 MeV. Despite many promises, this model suffers a few drawbacks in\nconsidering the dynamics of quarks and pions. We see how naturally Walcher's 22 MeV\nGoldstone arises in our Spin Matrix construction (see Figs 2, 3).\n\nIV.a \"Chiral Asymptote\"\nWe have obtained a universal fitting function from adjusting our linear Spin Matrix state\nvalues to fit the \u03c00 meson and the HyperCP 214 MeV energy, which works well for our purposes\nf ( x) =\n\nme c 2 x\n,\nme c 2 + 0.000213x\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x equals the energy of the state from the Spin Matrix to be adjusted. We can see that\neq.(2) is essentially a modification of the reduced mass eq. (1). We would like to note that our\nfactor of 0.000213 is close to 4\u03b12 though we have not made any definitive connection yet. Let\nus see Figure 4 for the detailed behavior of our f(x). It is a nearly linear function at 0 < x < 100\nMeV, then it gets some non-linearity which increases with energy and starts to flatten out in the\n200 MeV region. With energy increase, f(x) continues to behave this way further, until it is\ncompletely flattened out at about 2.4 GeV. But this is just a boundary of a region, which fits\nnicely into color screening or a partial confinement scenario. A few papers by Arbuzov [10],\nGoldman [11], Garcilazo [12], Jaffe [13], Stepanov [14] describe this rich phenomenon via\ndifferent models, but our 2.4 GeV value just fits in the overall parameter's window. Garcilazo et\nal used a screened potential of the Bhaduri-type [12] and explained the so-called missing\nresonance problem in N- \u2206 spectra with screening boundary of just about 2.4 GeV.\n\nFigure 4. Fitting Function\n\nRestoration of chiral symmetry can really be put on solid ground, which was done\nrecently in -expansion GNJL approach by Kalashnikova et al [15]. The grand result shown is \u2013\n\n6\n\n\fchiral symmetry is restored high in the spectrum of heavy-light mesons, and indeed, parity\ndoubling was demonstrated to occur above the scale of about 2.5 GeV, regardless of the explicit\nform of the confining potential. Kalashnikova [15] defines this scale of symmetry restoration\n\u039brest, as a scale at which splitting within a chiral doublet is much smaller than the BCS scale\n\u039bBCS = 250 MeV. They also conclude that chiral symmetry is restored in the spectrum if the\npionic wave function vanishes for given values of relative inter-quark momentum. But this is\npractically our asymptotic value of 2.4 GeV, which could be considered as a point of phase\ntransition in our framework. The authors [15] identified the following three regimes 1) chiral\nregime, p < \u039bBCS, with chiral symmetry breaking playing a dominant role in the interaction; 3)\nthe restoration regime, \u039brest < p (p-momentum), which realizes for highly excited states in\nspectrum, where parity doublets, and even chiral quartets appeared; 2) the intermediate regime,\nwhich interpolates regimes 1) and 3).\nOur asymptotical function f(x) can be mapped into their three regimes' domain or vice\nversa. The first will correspond to our e+, e-, u, d \u2013quarks, Walcher's (23 MeV), Mac GregorAkers-Palazzi (35 MeV, 70 MeV) goldstones, and a pion (135 MeV). The second regime will be\nhome for our new X (214 MeV) particle. Third regime will be started from the 2.4 GeV = \u039brest\nand will go all the way to E = . Many particles and resonances can live in II and III domains.\nLet's take a closer look at light unflavored mesonic sector (the biggest of all). We can\nforesee such possible parity doublets (PD) there:\n(1+ (J -- )) - a(1- (J ++ )) - they are vector-axial vector doublets (VAV)\nh(0- (J +- )) - (0+ (J -+ ))\nf(0+ (J ++ )) - (0- (J -- ))\nf(0+ (J ++ )) - \u03c6(0- (J -- ))\nb(1- (J +- )) - (1- (J -+ ))\n\n(3)\n\nWe can also create P-doublets via different symmetry principles. Now we have found the\npossible P-doublets in the light unflavored mesonic sector. These are f-\u03c9 and \u03c1-a -families.\nLet's consider the overlap value for different pairs in the quartets:\n- (1649)\n{ fa (1518)\n(1640) - (1723)\n(1955) - f (2048)\n{ (1994)\n- a (2070)\n(2250) - f (2303)\n{ (2186)\n- a (2310)\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n- 12% overlap\n- 71% overlap\n\n(4)\n\n- 100% overlap\n\nThe first quartet has Mave1 = 1633 MeV, the second quartet has Mave2 = 2017 MeV, and the third\nquartet has Mave3 = 2262 MeV. We are witnessing here an outstanding phenomenon, as we move\nhigher in the spectrum. An overlap is getting larger and reaches 100% for the highest two pairs.\nWhat is more is that high in the spectra, ALL parity doublets become degenerate and fused into\none state. This is exactly a harbinger for chiral symmetry restoration high in the mass spectrum!\nWe note in passing that the occurrence of our 1, 2, 3 quartets resembles nicely the leveling-off\nbehavior of our fitting function f(x).\n\n7\n\n\fNow we can combine these multiplets with so-called U(1)A pairs, originating from axial\nsymmetry,\n(2190) - f 0 (2197)\n(2303) - f 0 (2329)\n2 (2258) - f 2 (2231)\n4 (2250) - a 4 (2280)\n\n(5)\n\nFrom this set (5) one can see the creation of f-a-\u03c0-\u03b7 box with boundaries 2190-2329 MeV. Let\nus combine set (5) with vector-axial-vector \u03c1-a parity doublets, which will confine within a\n2186-2329 MeV box. As a result, we have a high-lying supermultiplet, exhibiting a perfect\nmatch between VAV parity doublets and U (1)A pairs, with box 2186-2329 MeV. This proves\ntotal degeneracy of states and restoration of the chiral symmetry high in the spectrum.\nOn the other hand our extensive research on hadronic Regge trajectories (RT) shows [16]\nthat our asymptotic fitting curve f(x) could be well matched by the bulk of the mesonic and\nbaryonic RT's in orbital space, i.e. M2 = M2(L, nr = fixed). Our asymptote boundary at M = 2.4\nGeV beautifully corresponds to the flattening out of RT's. We know that clearly light unflavored\nmesons and N - \u2206 - \u039b - \u03a3 baryonic spectra do terminate at 2.4 \u2013 2.5 GeV value (and most\ndefinitely by 3 GeV) [17].\n\nV. Conclusions\nTo this date, no one has been able to successfully explain the mass spectrum of all the\nknown particles. We don't pretend that we can fully explain it either but we expect the solution\nto be a geometrical one of some fashion. Our 2D Spin Matrix geometry is our first attempt for a\ngeometrical solution and it has some promising features that warrant further investigation.\nStarting with the rest mass energy of the electron or positron, our geometry generates energy\nstates that can be applied to the up and down quarks, pi zero mesons, the new HyperCP particle\nand many others. We have to stress that our scheme is parameter-free.\nWe can also see areas of chiral symmetry as well as areas of other symmetrical principles.\nA curious symmetry can be seen for the LTV dd quark areas (8.111 MeV) in one of the isolated\nregions. It seems that these three dd quark areas would have to have a three-way chirality with\nrespect to each other. Normally one thinks of left-handed and right-handed for chiral\nsymmetries, but we are wondering what would happen if a three-way chirality was applied to the\ngroup theories of particle physics. Another curious symmetry is that either the LTV e+ e- states\nor the LTV uu quark states can be the center of symmetry for our Spin Matrix geometry.\nIn presenting this geometrical model, it is easy to see why it has been so hard to find an\nexplanation and mathematical formulation for the particle spectrum. The particle spectrum is\ndependent on an equilibrium of complicated field interactions in the less than virtual sector of\nthe quantum vacuum. Perhaps our Spin Matrix is a start to finding the proper explanation.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] H. Park, et al., HyperCP Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005) 021801, hep-ex/0501014.\n[2] C.F.
