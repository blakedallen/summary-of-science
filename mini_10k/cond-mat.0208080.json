Two different\nregimes have been identified experimentally [1]. The\n\"solvophobic\" regime occurs for large solvent dielectric\nconstants that effectively turn off Coulombic interactions.\nConsequently, solvophobic phase transitions are primarily driven by unfavourable interactions between solute\nand solvent. This behavior is well described by the usual\ntheory of nonelectrolyte solutions with short range interactions, and clearly leads to Ising-like critical behavior.\nBy contrast, in the \"Coulombic\" regime the solvent has\na low dielectric constant and electrostatic interactions\nbetween the solute ions drive the phase separation. In\nthis case, the phase diagrams are quite asymmetric, and\napparently mean-field critical behavior has been claimed\n[2, 3, 4], although Ising-mean field crossover has also been\nseen within a narrower range of temperatures around the\ncritical than in non-ionic fluids [5, 6, 7, 8]. Some of these\nexperimental studies suggest that there exists a new characteristic length in these systems that competes with the\ncorrelation length for density fluctuations [7, 8].\nElectrolyte systems in the Coulomb regime are often\nmodelled as charged hard spheres embedded in a uniform\ndielectric continuum (primitive models). Most studied is\nthe \"restricted primitive model\" (RPM), in which the\nions are of equal size. A vapor-liquid phase transition at\nvery low temperatures and densities was predicted theoretically 25 years ago [9] and by early computer simulation studies [10]. Improvement of computer simulation\ntechniques has allowed an increasingly precise determination of the coexistence parameters [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor. Electronic address: enrome@us.es\n\nThere have also been recent studies of primitive models\nwith asymmetry in size [17, 18, 19] and charge [19, 20].\nVery recent results suggest that the critical behavior of\nthe RPM belongs to the Ising universality class [16].\nFrom a theoretical point of view, different approaches\nhave been used in order to explain the vapor-liquid transition of the primitive models. Integral equations such as\nthe mean spherical approximation (MSA) [21, 22], as well\nas the Debye-H\u00fcckel theory [21] and Poisson-Boltzmann\napproaches [23] have succesfully been applied to it. For\nthe RPM, the most succesful theories are the pairing theories, that consider the ionic fluid as a mixture of bound\npairs and free ions in chemical equilibrium [21, 24], in the\nspirit of the Bjerrum's ideas [25]. However, in all these\ntheories the transition is driven by the free ions, even\nwhen in same cases, as in the Debye-H\u00fcckel-Bjerrum approach, the associated pairs are the dominant species.\nAnalytical [26] and computer simulation [27] results, on\nthe other hand, show that the structure of the vapor\nphase is dominated by neutral clusters, mostly dimers\nand tetramers. Computer simulations have also demonstrated that the phase envelope of the RPM resembles\nthat of the charged hard dumbbell model [17, 28]. This\nresult has been confirmed by theoretical studies [29, 30].\nThe question that the present work examines in detail\nis the influence of ionic association on the vapor-liquid\ntransition of primitive model electrolytes. In contrast to\nan earlier study [17], which only considered tightly bound\ndimers, here we examine a range of models with varying\nvalues of Rc , the maximum separation between ions in\na dimer. Rc \u2192 \u221e corresponds to the Stillinger-Lovett\ndescription [31] of the free ion system.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section\nII, we examine the microscopic structure of the coexisting phases of the ionic fluid and compare the correlation\nfunctions to those of a tightly tethered dimer model. In\nSection III, an exact chemical representation of the ionic\nfluid as a mixture of associated pairs and free ions is in-\n\n\f2\ntroduced. The role of the associated pairs on the phase\ncoexistence is studied in detail in Section IV and the paper closes with discussion and conclusions.\n\nII. MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THE\nIONIC AND TETHERED DIMER SYSTEMS AT\nCOEXISTENCE\n\nIn this Section we analyse the role of pairing on\ngas-liquid coexistence of primitive model ionic fluids.\nWe have studied by computer simulation an 1:1 sizeasymmetric primitive model, in which the ions are modelled as hard spheres of diameters \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212 , and carrying charges +q and \u2212q, respectively, embedded on a\ndielectric continuum of dielectric constant D (D = 1 for\nthe vacuum). The interaction potential between two ions\nseparated by a distance rij is given by:\nuij (rij ) = uhs (rij ) +\n\nqi qj\nDrij\n\n(1)\n\nwhere uhs (rij ) is the hard-core potential that takes the\nvalue +\u221e if rij < 12 (\u03c3i + \u03c3j ) and 0 otherwise.\nThe size asymmetry is characterized by the parameter\n\u03bb, defined as:\n\u03bb=\n\n\u03c3\u2212\n\u03c3+\n\n(2)\n\nMonte Carlo simulations in the neutral grandcanonical ensemble were performed, characterized by a\ntemperature T and the configurational chemical potential for a pair of unlike ions \u03bc = 2\u03bcreal \u22123kB T ln (\u039b+ \u039b\u2212 ),\nwith \u03bcreal \u2261 (\u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212 )/2 and \u039b\u00b1 are the thermal de\nBroglie wavelengths of the ionic species:\ns\nh2\n(3)\n\u039b\u00b1 =\n2\u03c0m\u00b1 kB T\nAs usual, cubic boxes of length L under periodic boundary conditions are used. The long-ranged character of\nthe Coulombic interactions is handled by the use the\nEwald summation tecnique with conducting boundary\nconditions, with 518 Fourier-space wavevectors and realspace damping parameter \u03ba = 5. The relative error due\nto the infinite sums truncation in the electrostatic energy is less than 10\u22125 for random configurations in small\nsystems [32], and this choice has been also validated by\ndirect simulations of the RPM [15]. In order to speed up\nthe simulations, the basic steps of the simulations (insertion and deletions of pairs of unlike ions) are biased\nfollowing [11]. Moreover, a fine-discretization approximation is used: the positions available to each ion are the\nsites of a simple cubic lattice of spacing a. This methodology has succesfully been applied to the RPM [14], to\n1:1 size-asymetric primitive models [17] and to z:1 sizeasymetric primitive models [14], and allows a speedup\nrelative to the continuum calculations of a factor of 100\n\nfor small systems. The results are almost indistinguishable from the continuum ones for a discretization parameter \u03b6 \u2261 \u03c3\u00b1 /a = 10 [14, 17, 19], where \u03c3\u00b1 = 21 (\u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212 )\nis the unlike-ion collision diameter. This value of the discretization parameter (\u03b6 = 10) was used in the present\nstudy. Histogram reweighting techniques [33] and mixedfield finite size scaling methods [34] were used to obtain the vapor-liquid envelopes and the effective critical points, respectively. For the sake of comparison, we\nhave also studied tightly tethered dipolar dimer systems\n[17, 28], consisting of N pairs of a positive and negative ion restricted to remain at separations \u03c3d satisfying\n\u03c3\u00b1 \u2264 \u03c3d \u2264 1.02\u03c3\u00b1 . Simulation details and some preliminary results for a range of values of \u03bb are presented in\nRef. [17].\nThe unlike-ion collision diameter \u03c3\u00b1 provides the basic\nlength scale appropriate for defining both the reduced\ntemperature and reduced density via\nT \u2217 = kB T D\u03c3\u00b1 /q 2\n\n3\n/L3\nand \u03c1\u2217 = 2N \u03c3\u00b1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N+ = N\u2212 \u2261 N is the particle number of each ionic\nspecies [11, 17, 22]. The reduced simulation box length\nis defined similarly via L\u2217 = L/\u03c3\u00b1 , and the reduced energies and chemical potential as U \u2217 = U D\u03c3\u00b1 /q 2 and\n\u03bc\u2217 = \u03bcD\u03c3\u00b1 /q 2 .\nThe value of the asymmetry parameter considered in\nthis paper is \u03bb = 3. For that case, the gas-liquid coexistence of the ionic fluid shows a shift in both temperature and density respect to the tethered dimer fluid\n(see Fig. 1), which is a general feature when comparing\nionic and tethered dimer systems [17]. On the other hand\nthe asymmetry is not high so as to favor large chain-like\nneutral clusters, as occurs for bigger values of \u03bb [17, 18].\nThese features qualify this case to be a typical example\nfor moderately asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, including the\nRPM.\nFig. 1 makes the similarity between the phase diagram\nof the ionic and the tethered dimer fluids clear. It also\nsuggests in an indirect way that the pairing plays a decisive role on the gas-liquid coexistence in the ionic fluid.\nIn order to clarify such a role, we have studied the ion-ion\nradial distribution functions gij (r) corresponding to the\nionic systems, and the corresponding ones for the tethered dimer systems. For this purpose, we have considered\nthe gas and liquid states at coexistence for a temperature\nT \u2248 0.95Tc, with Tc the corresponding critical temperature. The ion-ion radial distribution functions of the\nionic systems, for T \u2217 = 0.0425 and the coexisting densities \u03c1\u2217 = 0.0076(15) and \u03c1\u2217 = 0.162(3) are plotted in\nFigs. 2 and 3, respectively. In both cases, the unlike-ion\nradial distribution function becomes very large close to\ncontact, indicating the association in bound pairs of unlike ions. Moreover, the like-ion radial distribution functions show maxima around r\u2217 = 1.5 (in the case of g\u2212\u2212 ,\nthis peak coincides with the contact value), and there is a\nsecondary maximum in g+\u2212 for r\u2217 \u2248 2.5. These observations allow us to conclude that there are high correlation\nbetween pairs of associated unlike ions. We recall that\n\n\f3\nthe range of densities in which the gas-liquid coexistence\noccurs prevents packing effects, so the structure is completely given by the Coulombic interactions.\nThe ion-ion radial distribution functions for the tethered dimer fluid are plotted on the Fig. 4 for the gas\nbranch (T \u2217 = 0.0405, \u03c1\u2217 = 0.0119(15)) and Fig. 5 for the\nliquid branch (T \u2217 = 0.0405, \u03c1\u2217 = 0.206(2)). The comparison between the ionic fluid and tethered dimer fluid\nmicroscopic structures confirms the qualitative similarity\nbetween both systems. A further test of this similarity\nis found in the comparison of the neutral cluster populations in the gas branch. We use Gillan's definition of a\ncluster [26]. Two ions i and j are directly bound when\nc\nthe distance between them is less than Rij\n. This condition defines mathematically an equivalence relationship,\nand the equivalences classes in which the ions group are\nthe clusters. As the interaction between like ions is rec\npulsive, the dependence of the cluster definition on R++\nc\nor R\u2212\u2212 should be very weak (if they are taken smaller\nthan the mean distance between two like ions). On the\nother hand, the cluster definition is not very sensitive to\nc\nthe value of R+\u2212\nif that value lies between the first minimum of g+\u2212 and the mean distance between aggregates.\nc\nc\nc\nIn this work we have used R++\n= R\u2212\u2212\n= R+\u2212\n= 1.5\u03c3\u00b1 .\nAs expected, the microscopic structure of the gas phase is\ndominated by the N -ion neutral clusters [17, 27]. Their\nfractions fN for the ionic and tethered ion systems at\nthe gas phase in coexistence for T = 0.95Tc are quite\nsimilar (see Fig. 6), although the tethered dimer systems\nhave slightly higher fractions of neutral clusters than do\nionic systems, specially for large N , in agreement with\nthe results previously reported [17].\nDespite the similarities found between the ionic fluid\nand the tethered dimer fluid, there are some differences\nthat can rationalize the quantitative differences between\ntheir phase diagrams. The unlike-ion radial distribution\nfunctions of the tethered dimer fluid differ qualitatively\nfrom the ionic counterparts close to the contact value,\nsince in the former there is a jump at the maximum allowed separation of two ions of a dimer, while the ionic\ng+\u2212 takes smoothly higher values on that range of values\nof r\u2217 . Consequently, the condition on the confinement of\nthe ions that compose a tethered dimer must be relaxed\nin order to refine the pairing concept in the ionic fluids. In the next Section we will introduce an appropriate\nframework for such a goal.\n\nIII.\n\nCHEMICAL PICTURE OF IONIC FLUIDS\n\nWe consider an ionic fluid (q+ = \u2212q\u2212 \u2261 q) be contained in a volume V and in equilibrium with a reservoir at a temperature T and chemical potentials \u03bc+ and\n\u03bc\u2212 . For simplicity, the neutral grand-canonical ensemble,\nin which only neutral configurations are allowed, will be\nconsidered. This ensemble has been shown to be equivalent to the usual grand-canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit [35]. The neutral grand-canonical par-\n\ntition function can be written as:\n\u221e \u0012 \u03b2\u03bc \u0013Ni \u0012 \u03b2\u03bc \u0013Ni\nX\ne\ne\n\u039e=\nZU (Ni , Ni )\n3\n\u039b+\n\u039b3\u2212\n\n(5)\n\nNi =0\n\nwhere Ni is the number of ions of each species, \u03b2 =\n1/(kB T ), \u03bc \u2261 (\u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212 )/2, \u039b+ and \u039b\u2212 are the thermal\nde Broglie wavelengths corresponding to each species,\nand ZU (Ni , Ni ) is the canonical configurational partition\nfunction corresponding to a fixed number of ions at the\ntemperature T and enclosed in the volumen V :\nZ\n1\n\u2212 \u2212\u03b2U\nZU (Ni , Ni ) =\ndr+ dr\u2212 . . . dr+\nNi drNi e\n(Ni !)2 V 2Ni 1 1\n(6)\nP\nwith U \u2261 U phys = Uhc + i<j qi qj /(Drij ) the total potential energy and Uhc the hard-core contribution, equal\nto +\u221e if two particles overlap, and 0 otherwise (other\ntempered potentials can be used, but the main results of\nthis Section will remain unchanged). If the fluid particles\nare strongly associated into bound (+, \u2212) pairs, as occurs\nin the low-temperature and low-density region in which\nthe vapor-liquid transition occurs for the ionic fluids, the\n\"physical\" representation described above will be inadequate, and it can replaced by a \"chemical\" picture, in\nwhich the fluid is composed by associated pairs and free\nions. First, a rule that unequivocally identifies bound\npairs for each configuration of the ionic fluid (up to a set\nof null measure in the configurational space) is needed.\nOnce such a rule is defined, we can write the canonical\nconfigurational partition function as:\nZU (Ni , Ni ) =\n\nNi\nX\n\nZU\u2217 (Nf , Nf , Np )\n\n(7)\n\nNp =0\n\nwhere Np is the number of bound pairs, Nf = Ni \u2212\nNp is the number of free ions of each species, and\nZU\u2217 (Nf , Nf , Np ) is the canonical configurational partition\nfunction corresponding to a system of Np associated pairs\nand Nf free ions of each species:\nZ\n1\n1\nZU\u2217 (Nf , Nf , Np ) =\nd(1) . . . d(Np )\nNp ! (Nf !)2 V 2(Np +Nf )\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212 \u2212\u03b2U\n\u00d7 dr+\n1 dr1 . . . drNf drNf e\n\n\u2217\n\n(8)\n\nwhere (i) \u2261 {r+ , r\u2212 }i are the positions of the ions that\n+(\u2212)\ncorresponds to\ncompose the associated pair i, and ri\nthe coordinates of a +(\u2212) free ion i, respectively. The potential energy U \u2217 \u2261 U chem does not coincide, in general,\nwith the physical potential energy U phys , since different\nconfigurations of the \"chemical\" mixture can be compatible with a given ionic configuration.\nSubstituting equation (7) into the equation (5) and\nrearranging the resulting expression, the neutral grandcanonical partition function can be written as:\n\u221e\n\u221e \u0012 \u03b2\u03bc \u0013Nf \u0012 \u03b2\u03bc \u0013Nf \u0012 \u03b2\u03bcp \u0013Np\nX\nX\ne\ne\ne\n\u039e =\n\u039b3+\n\u039b3\u2212\n\u039b6p\n\u00d7\n\nNf =0 Np =0\nZU\u2217 (Nf , Nf , Np )\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\np\nwith \u03bcp \u2261 2\u03bc and \u039bp =\n\u039b+ \u039b\u2212 . These last definitions correspond to the chemical equilibrium conditions\nbetween the free ions and the associated pairs [21, 36].\nWe remark that this derivation is independent of the criterion chosen to define the pairs. However, the choice\nmust be such that matches the microscopic structure of\nthe fluid. As we have seen in the previous Section, the vapor structure is dominated by neutral aggregates, mostly\ndimers and tetramers. This fact is consistent with the\nBjerrum ideas of pairing [25]. Consequently, a distancebased criterion seems to be the most appropriate: two\nunlike ions that are closer than Rc (Rc being a suitable\ncutoff distance) are considered as an associated pair. It is\neasy to see that such a criterion does not define uniquely\nthe associated pairs when the population of tetramers\nand higher order neutral clusters is not negligible, as it\ncan be seen from Fig. 7, since there are different arrangements of associated pairs that are compatible with the\nsame ionic configuration. Hence, a more systematic criterion is needed, in order to be able to define associated\npairs for almost every ionic configuration, while keeping\n\nU\n\nchem\n\n= U\n\nphys\n\n+\n\nNp\nX\ni=1\n\nNp Nf\n\n+\n\nXX\ni=1 j=1\n\nv p ({r+ , r\u2212 }i ) +\n\nv p+ ({r+ , r\u2212 }i , r+\nj )+\n\nthe intuitive definition of an associated pair as encompassing unlike ions that are at the closest distances. We\nuse a suitable modification of the Stillinger-Lovett pair\ndefinition on a given ionic configuration [31]. In this prescription, all the distances between two unlike ions are\ncomputed, and then the first pair is defined as the two\nunlike ions at closest distance. This step is repeated,\ntaking into account only ions that remain unpaired from\nprevious steps for the evaluation of (+, \u2212) distances. We\nstop when the minimum distance between two unlike ions\nis greater than Rc , considering the remaining ions as free\nions (no free ions were considered in [31], and consequently Rc \u2261 \u221e in that case). This protocol provides\nan unique configuration of associated pairs and free ions\nfor almost each ionic configuration, since the method is\nambiguous only in a subset of the ionic configurations in\nwhich at least two (+, \u2212) distances are equal, and the\nmeasure of such a set is null in the configurational space.\nObviously, different pairing prescriptions can be used.\nHowever, this protocol provides an explicit expression for\nthe \"chemical\" potential energy U chem :\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264Np\nNp Nf\nX\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere U phys is the physical potential energy due to the\nhard-core and eletrostatic interactions, and the other\nterms correspond to effective interactions of entropic origin needed to reduce the configurational space of the\n\"chemical\" system. The term v p ({r+ , r\u2212 }i ) depends only\non the positions of the ions that compose an associated\npair and confines them to be at a distance shorter than\nRc :\n\uf8f1\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n|r+\n\uf8f20\ni \u2212 ri | \u2264 Rc\n(11)\nv p ({r+ , r\u2212 }i ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3+\u221e |r+ \u2212 r\u2212 | > R\nc\ni\ni\n\nThe pairwise potential energy v pp ({r+ , r\u2212 }i , {r+ , r\u2212 }j )\ncorresponds to an steric hindrance condition between\ntwo associated pairs [31], since the distances between\ntwo unlike ions corresponding to different pairs cannot\nbe shorter than the minimum distance between the ions\nthat compose each pair:\n\uf8f1\n\u2213\n\u00b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2+\u221e |ri \u2212 rj | \u2264 dij\npp\n+ \u2212\n+ \u2212\nv ({r , r }i , {r , r }j ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\notherwise\n(12)\n\nv pp ({r+ , r\u2212 }i , {r+ , r\u2212 }j )\n\nv p\u2212 ({r+ , r\u2212 }i , r\u2212\nj )+\n\nNf Nf\nX\nX\n\n\u2212\nv +\u2212 (r+\ni , rj )\n\n(10)\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nwith dij \u2261 min(|r+\ni \u2212 ri |, |rj \u2212 rj |).\nThe interaction between the associated pairs and the\nfree ions is modified by the term v p\u00b1 ({r+ , r\u2212 }i , r\u00b1\nj ), that\nprevents the free ion to be closer to the unlike ion of the\nassociated pair than its partner:\n\uf8f1\n\u2213\n\u00b1\n+\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2+\u221e |ri \u2212 rj | \u2264 |ri \u2212 ri |\n\u00b1\np\u00b1\n+ \u2212\nv ({r , r }i , rj ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\notherwise\n(13)\n\nFinally, two unlike free ions cannot be at a shorter\n\u2212\ndistance than Rc due to the term v +\u2212 (r+\ni , rj ):\n\uf8f1\n+\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2+\u221e |ri \u2212 rj | \u2264 Rc\n\u2212\n(14)\nv +\u2212 (r+\ni , rj ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\n\u2212\n|r+\n\u2212\nr\n|\n>\nR\nc\ni\nj\n\nIt is not hard to see that a mixture of associated pairs\nand free ions with a potential energy given by the Eq.\n(10) is completely equivalent to the original ionic system. It is interesting to note that, except the term on\nvp that ties the ions that compose an associated pair,\nthe other terms are pairwise, short-ranged modifications\n\n\f5\nof the hard-core conditions, so the potential energy of\nan allowed mixture configuration is the same as in the\ncorresponding ionic configuration. Moreover, every configuration of associated pairs and free ions obtained from\nan ionic configuration by the pairing procedure described\nabove fulfil the constrains induced by the added potentials. Conversely, the mixture configuration is the same\nas the one obtained from the corresponding ionic configuration by the Stillinger-Lovett protocol.\nThis analysis provides an exact chemical representation of the ionic system as a mixture of bound pairs and\nfree ions in chemical equilibrium. The equivalence between representations of the system is not only at the\nlevel of thermodynamic properties, but also in the microscopic structure, unlike previous studies based on the\nmatching of the \"chemical\" and the \"physical\" free energies, e.g. via the virial coefficients [37, 38]. In those studies the effective potentials given by Eqs. (11) and (14)\ncould be guessed, but the other terms (that arise from\nmatching third and higher order virial coefficients) were\nnot clearly identified. Furthermore, they have not being\nused at all in pairing theories of electrolytes. We must\nstress the importance of the effective new term given by\nEq. (12) in the potential energy, that reduces the configuration space available to the associated pairs. This\neffect is specially important for high values of Rc . An\nextreme case case that illustrates the effect of missing the\nsteric hindrance term is the loosely tethered dimer fluid,\nin which the ions that compose the pair can be at any relative distance greater than \u03c3\u00b1 . In this case, the canonical\npartition function of the dimer fluid is Np ! \u00d7 ZU (Np , Np ),\nwhere Np is the number of dimers, ZU (Np , Np ) is given\nby Eq. (6) and the Np ! factor is the number of different\nways of pairing the unlike ions in each ionic configuration\nand lead to different dimer configurations. As a consequence, in the thermodynamic limit the Helmholtz free\nenergy per particle fd of the loosely tethered dimer fluid\ndiverges as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2fi\nfd\n\u223c \u2212 ln Np +\n+1\n(15)\nkB T\nkB T\nwhere fi is the ionic Helmholtz free energy per ion, that\nit is well-behaved in the case of neutral systems [35].\nThe association degree of the ionic fluid in the coexistence region has been studied by computer simulation in the framework of the previous analysis. In\nthe usual grand-canonical simulations, we have identified the\n\u221a associated pairs by the Stillinger-Lovett rule with\nRc = 3L/2, i.e. all the ions are associated, and the minimum image convention is used in order to calculate the\ndistances between unlike ions. The probability distributions p(r) of having a pair an internal separation distance\nr between ions is plotted in the Fig. 8 for the gas and\nliquid phases at T \u2217 = 0.0443. Surprisingly, both distributions are practically identical, despite the fact that the\ncorresponding densities are quite different. The distributions show a very pronounced peak for r = \u03c3\u00b1 , and a\nlocal maximum around r = 2.5\u03c3\u00b1 , approximately where\n\ng+\u2212 presents the second local maximum. For large values\nof r, the distributions p(r) decay to zero. These results\nconfirm the strong association in the ionic fluid at low\ntemperatures, and that the structure is weakly affected\nby variations in density, at least in the range in which the\ngas-liquid coexistence occurs. For values of r close to the\ncontact value, the distribution is well described by the\nnon-interacting pair fluid probability distribution, given\nby the following expression:\n\u0010 2 \u0011\nr2 exp DkqB T r\n\u0010 2 \u0011\npideal (r) \u2248 R R\nc\ny 2 exp DkqB T y dy\n\u03c3\u00b1\n\u0012\nh\u03c3\ni\u0013\nq 2 r2\nq2\n\u00b1\n\u22121\n(16)\n\u223c\n4 \u00d7 exp Dk T \u03c3\nDkB T \u03c3\u00b1\nr\nB\n\u00b1\nvalid for T \u2217 \u226a 1 and an internal cutoff Rc \u226b \u03c3\u00b1 . However, for r & 1.5\u03c3\u00b1 , p(r) deviates from the ideal expression as a consequence of the interaction between associated pairs. The local maximum showed by the distribution function indicates that the most bound pairs\nare solvated by less bound pairs, to form stable neutral\ntetramers (and higher order clusters, but their inclusion\ndoes not seem to affect the conclusions of this Section).\nThis fact is in agreement with the features observed in\nthe pair correlation functions in the previous Section. We\nmust stress that the structure that p(r) presents is only\ndue to the Coulombic interactions.\nIt is instructive to compare our results in the coexistence region to the higher temperature ones. We have\ncomputed p(r) at T \u2217 = 1 and the same range of densities\n(see Fig. 9). The qualitative behavior of p(r) at high\ntemperatures is similar to that predicted by Stillinger\nand Lovett [39]. First, it shows a maximum localized in\n1\nr \u223c \u03c1\u2212 3 . On the other hand, p(r) takes significant values in a wider range than the corresponding functions at\nlower temperatures, decaying for large values of r as r\u2212n ,\nwith n \u2248 3. The latter prediction differs from the value\nn = 4 given in Ref. [39] and requires further study to\nelucidate it.\nThe probability distribution pRc (r) of having a pair an\ninternal separation distance between ions when the cutoff\ndistance to define a pair is equal to Rc can be obtained\nfrom p(r) as:\npRc (r) =\n\np(r)\np(r)\n= R Rc\n\u2118(Rc )\np(t)dt\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c3\u00b1\n\nRr\nwhere \u2118(r) \u2261 \u03c3\u00b1 p(t)dt is the cumulant distribution corresponding to p(r). The density of associated pairs is\nequal to \u03c1\u2118(Rc )/2, and the total density of free ions is\n\u03c1[1 \u2212 \u2118(Rc )], where \u03c1 is the total density of ions in the\nphysical picture. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that for\nRc & 3\u03c3\u00b1 , more than 95% of ions are associated into\npairs in both vapor and liquid phases. So, if the associated pair fluid phase separate in the same (T, \u03c1) region\nas the ionic fluid, it is expected than the free ions do play\n\n\f6\na mere perturbative role in the phase coexistence. Actually, the free ionic subsystem is a non-additive binary\ncharged hard-sphere mixture, where Rc plays the role of\nthe unlike-ion collision diameter. However, the interactions between like ions are purely repulsive, and it is not\nexpected differences between the behavior of this mixture\nand the RPM as soon as \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212 are less than Rc .\nFurthermore, this system is in a polar environment given\nby the associated pair subsystem, and consequently the\neffective dielectric constant Def f of the background will\nbe increased. Then the free ion subsystem is expected\nto have the same behavior as the RPM at the effective\nreduced temperature T\u0303 :\nT\u0303 =\n\nDef f\nRc\nDef f kB T Rc\n=\n\u00d7 T\u2217\n\u00d7\n2\nq\nD\n\u03c3\u00b1\n\nthermore, we can analyse the role played by the associated pairs in the phase equilibrium by eliminating the free\nions. We have performed grand-canonical Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the associated dimer system for \u03bb = 3 and\ndifferent values of Rc . No free ions are allowed (Nf \u2261 0)\nand the potential energy of one configuration is given by\nthe Eq. (10). The grand-canonical free energies corresponding to these systems will consequently provide an\nupper bound to the ionic fluid grand-canonical free energy at the same temperature and pair chemical potential. As for the ionic system, a fine-discretization approach with a refinement parameter \u03b6 = 10, and Ewald\nsummation technique with conducting boundary conditions is used to take into account the long range character of the Coulombic interations. The basic steps are either insertion or deletion of associated pairs (chosen randomly with the same probability), biased with a Boltzmann distribution that depends on the separation between the ions that compose the dimer. An associated\npair is inserted in the following way: the negative ion\nis placed at a random place in the box, and its counterion is placed at a relative position r\u00b1 (\u03c3\u00b1 \u2264 |r\u00b1 | <\nRc ) following a \u0001probability distribution proportional to\nexp \u03b20 q 2 \u03c60 (r\u00b1 ) , where \u2212\u03c60 (r) is the Ewald potential\nenergy between two unlike ions of unit charge. On the\nother hand, a pair is deleted\nwith a probability propor\u0001\ntional to exp \u03b20 q 2 \u03c60 (r\u00b1 ) , being r\u00b1 the relative position\nof the positive ion of the pair with respect to the negative\none. The value of \u03b20 has been adjusted to improve the\nsampling during the simulation. In this work we have set\n\u03b20 = 8.\n\n(18)\n\nwhere T \u2217 is the reduced temperature. For Rc & 3\u03c3\u00b1 , the\ncritical temperature reduces at least to one third of the\nRPM reduced critical temperature. Consequently, any\npossible free ion-driven vapor-liquid transition should\nhappen at much lower temperatures, and thus the free\nion subsystem should play no role in the vapor-liquid\ntransition. In order to check this hypothesis, the phase\ndiagram of the associated pair fluid has to be obtained.\nThis issue will be addressed in the next Section.\nIV.\n\nPHASE BEHAVIOR OF THE ASSOCIATED\nPAIRS FLUID\n\nThe results obtained in the previous Section suggest\nthat the \"chemical\" picture introduced above is a very\nconvenient description of the ionic fluid structure. Fur-\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ee\n\nX\n\n\uf8ec\nWiji = min \uf8ed1, (L\u2217 )3 exp(\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 \u03b2\u2206U ) \uf8f0\n\nThe acceptance probabilities of a pair insertion Wiji\nand a pair deletion, Wijd are the following:\n\n\u03c3\u00b1 \u2264|r\u00b1 |<Rc\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ec exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 \u03b2\u2206U ) \uf8f0\nWijd = min \uf8ed1,\n(L\u2217 )3\n\nX\n\n\u03c3\u00b1 \u2264|r\u00b1 |<Rc\n\nwhere i and j are the initial and final configurations, respectively, Np is the number of pairs at the configuration\ni, \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ), \u03bc is the configurational chemical potential, and \u2206U is the \"chemical\" potential energy variation\nin the movement, including the steric hindrance terms\ngiven by Eq. (12). As it can be seen, the acceptance\nprobabilities reduce to the usual ones as \u03b20 \u2192 0.\nEffective critical points for different values of L\u2217 were\nestimated by using mixed-field finite-size scaling methods [34] and assuming Ising-like criticality. Although re-\n\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\nNp +1\n\n2\n\nexp(\u03b20 q \u03c60 (r\u00b1 )) \uf8fb \uf8f0\n\u03b63\n2\n\n\uf8f9\u22121 \uf8ee\n\nexp(\u03b20 q \u03c60 (r\u00b1 )) \uf8fb\n\u03b63\n\n\uf8f0\n\nX\n\nk=1\n\nNp\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\uf8f9\u22121 \uf8f6\n\uf8f7\nexp(\u03b20 q 2 \u03c60 (rk\u00b1 ))\uf8fb \uf8f8\n\n\uf8f9\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\nexp(\u03b20 q 2 \u03c60 (rk\u00b1 ))\uf8fb\uf8f8\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\ncent results [40] indicate that the pressure should also enter the field mixing, our approach should be satisfactory\nto discern the dependence of the critical parameters on\nRc . Moreover, a systematic study for the RPM case has\nshown that the assumed universality class is very likely to\nbe the right one [16]. We use histogram reweighting techniques [33] to combine the histograms from different runs\n(typically three) and estimate the critical parameters and\ntheir standard errors. Very long runs are needed in order to overcome the critical slowing down and the low\n\n\f7\nacceptance ratios due to the low temperatures involved.\nDefining a step as a try of a pair insertion/deletion, we\nhave performed simulations of about 2 \u00d7 107 \u2212 4 \u00d7 107\nequilibration steps and 2 \u00d7 108 \u2212 4 \u00d7 108 sampling steps\nfor L\u2217 = 12; 5 \u00d7 107 \u2212 2 \u00d7 108 equilibration steps ans\n6 \u00d7 108 \u2212 1.2 \u00d7 109 sampling steps for L\u2217 = 15; and\n2 \u00d7 108 equilibration steps and 1.2 \u00d7 109 \u2212 1.8 \u00d7 109 sampling steps for L\u2217 = 18, in order to get good statistics for\nthe histograms. The (effective) critical parameters are\nobtained by minimizing the deviation of the appropriately scaled mixed-field M \u221d \u03c1 \u2212 su marginal probability distribution (u is the potential energy density and s is\nthe mixing parameter) with respect to the corresponding\ncritical 3-dimensional Ising universal function [34, 41].\nAs also occurs in the ionic and tethered dimer systems,\nthe matching improves as L\u2217 increases (see Fig. 10). Our\nestimations of the critical parameters for different values\nof L\u2217 and Rc\u2217 \u2261 Rc /\u03c3\u00b1 are listed in Table I and plotted in Figs. 11 and 12. The smallest value of Rc\u2217 is the\nsame as the maximum allowed separation in the tethered\ndimer system, and as expected the results obtained for\nthe associated pairs fluid are practically indistinguishable\nfrom the tethered dimer system. As Rc\u2217 increases, it is\nobserved a sharp increase in the critical temperature but\nthe critical density remains almost unaffected. However,\nfor Rc\u2217 \u2248 3 \u2212 4 the critical temperature reaches a maximum and then decreases, converging towards the free\nion critical temperature. On the other hand, the critical density also decreases towards the free ion critical\ndensity, although the statistical uncertainties are bigger\nfor this parameter and the exact path of convergence is\nless defined. We must also point out that the statistical uncertainties are big enough not to make possible an\nestimation of correction-to-scaling effects.\nFor an heuristic explanation for such a behavior, we\nhave to consider the energetically favoured configurations. It is important to consider the interaction between\ntwo different associated pairs, that has its minimum energy configuration in a square ring conformation for low\nvalues of \u03bb, with a close-energy secondary minimum conformation for the linear (+, \u2212) chain [17]. If Rc is too\nsmall, by deforming the square it is possible to find energetically relevant configurations (i.e. the potential energy\ndifference per ion of such configurations with respect to\nthe minimum one is of the same order as the thermal\nenergy) in which one of the associated pairs has an internal ionic separation less than Rc , but the other one does\nnot fulfil such a condition. Consequently, a greater value\nof Rc also increases the number of energetically relevant\nconfigurations between two associated pairs. Then the effective interaction between associated pairs is enhanced,\nand thus an increase of the critical temperature should be\nexpected until all the relevant configurations are allowed\n(that occurs for Rc \u223c 3\u03c3\u00b1 ). On the other hand, the average size of the associated pairs and their aggregates is\nincreased, leading to a decrease on the critical density\n(in order to keep the reduced density in terms of the effective particle size constant). These arguments are not\n\nlonger valid for Rc\u2217 & 3. Our results show the inclusion\nof associated pairs with larger internal ionic separations\nare not crucial to the gas-liquid phase transition but also\nthat they bar the phase transition, as it can inferred from\nthe critical parameters decrease.\nAs for the ionic and tethered dimer models, histogram\nreweighting techniques [33, 41] allow us to obtain the\ncoexistence curve up to T . 0.98Tc. As the finite-size\neffects are not important far from the critical point, we\nhave considered L\u2217 = 15. Taking advantage of the wide\nrange of densities covered by near-critical histograms, we\ncombine them with liquid subcritical state histograms in\norder to extend the density range. The extra simulations\ninvolve shorter runs (typically 2 \u00d7 108 steps after equilibration). The gas-liquid coexistence curves for different\nvalues of Rc\u2217 are plotted in Fig. 13, showing the same\ntendency as the observed one in the critical parameters.\nIt is interesting to note that the vapor branches coincide\n(except close to the critical point) for Rc > 3\u03c3\u00b1 . We conclude from this observation that is in the liquid branch\nwhere the ionic fluid differs mostly from the associated\npair system.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, an exact \"chemical\" representation of the\nionic system as a mixture of (+, \u2212) associated ion pairs\nand free ions has been introduced. This representation,\nclosely related to the Stillinger-Lovett pairing procedure\nfor the RPM, has the advantage that not only provides\nan exact matching of between the physical and chemical\nrepresentation thermodynamics, but also from a microscopic point of view. It also avoids an entropy catastrophe that occurs for the tethered dimer model studied at\nlarge values of the tether length. The addition to the\nphysical hamiltonian of some new pairwise hard-core interactions between the \"chemical\" components provides\nthe suitable hamiltonian for the \"chemical\" representation. In the low temperature and low density regime\nin which the ionic vapor-liquid transition occurs, such a\nrepresentation provides a faithful characterization of the\nmicroscopic structure of the ionic fluid, and it can be the\nbasis of new theoretical approaches.\nThe analysis of the phase behavior of the system only\ncomposed by associated pairs indicates strongly that the\nionic fluid vapor-liquid transition is driven by them. For\nRc . 3\u03c3\u00b1 , the critical temperature increases with Rc , as\nmore energetically favoured configurations are allowed.\nFor Rc & 3\u03c3\u00b1 , the critical parameters converge smoothly\nfrom above towards the ionic fluid critical parameters as\nRc increases. This fact indicates not only that the free\nions do not drive the phase transition, but also have the\nopposite effect in the transition. The value of Rc \u2248 3\u03c3\u00b1\ncorresponding to the maximum on the critical temperature, can be regarded as the optimal size of the associated\npair.\nSome remarks on the limitations of the present work\n\n\f8\nare appropriate at this point. We have focussed only on\nthe effect of the associated pairs in the thermodynamical properties. However, the conducting character of the\nionic fluid is completely driven by the free ions. On the\nother hand, the remarkable success of pairing theories\n(even when the \"chemical\" representation they implicitly\nuse is not completely correct) remains unexplained. It is\npossible that the associated pair solvation, in addition to\nthe ion-ion correlations, can mimic the pair-pair interactions. Further studies are needed to completely solve the\norigin of the ionic fluid vapor-liquid phase transition.\n\n[1] M. E. Fisher, J. Stat. Phys. 75, 1 (1994); J. Phys.: Condens.
