For all details, proofs\nand further information we refer to the many excellent books on the subject\ne.g. [48, 7, 49, 31, 22, 3, 53, 58].\nLet us consider a completely general system of differential equations\nx \u2208 Rp , u \u2208 Rq , a = 1, . . . N,\n\nEa (x, u, ux , uxx , . . . unx ) = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere e.g. unx denotes all (partial) derivatives of order n. The numbers p, q, n\nand N are all nonnegative integers.\nWe are interested in the symmetry group G of the system (1), i.e. in the\nlocal Lie group of local point transformations taking solutions of eq. (1) into solutions. Point transformations in the space X \u00d7U of independent and dependent\nvariables have the form\nx\u0303 = \u039b\u03bb (x, u),\n\n\u0169 = \u03a9\u03bb (x, u),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb denotes the group parameters. We have\n\u039b0 (x, u) = x,\n\n\u03a90 (x, u) = u\n\nand the inverse transformation (x\u0303, \u0169) \u2192 (x, u) exists, at least locally.\nThe transformations (2) of local coordinates in X \u00d7 U also determine the\ntransformations of functions u = f (x) and of derivatives of functions. A group\nG of local point transformations of X \u00d7 U will be a symmetry group of the\nsystem (1) if the fact that u(x) is a solution implies that \u0169(x\u0303) is also a solution.\nThe two fundamental questions to ask are:\n1. How to find the maximal symmetry group G for a given system of equations (1)?\n2. Once the group G is found, what do we do with it?\nLet us first discuss the question of motivation. The symmetry group G allows\nus to do the following.\n1. Generate new solutions from known ones. Sometimes trivial solutions can\nbe boosted into interesting ones.\n2. Identify equations with isomorphic symmetry groups. Such equations may\nbe transformable into each other. Sometimes nonlinear equations can be\ntransformed into linear ones.\n3. Perform symmetry reduction: reduce the number of variables in a PDE\nand obtain particular solutions, satisfying particular boundary conditions:\ngroup invariant solutions. For ODEs of order n, we can reduce the order\n2\n\n\fof the equation. In this reduction, there is no loss of information. If we\ncan reduce the order to zero, we obtain a general solution depending on\nn constants, or a general integral (an algebraic equation depending on n\nconstants).\nHow does one find the symmetry group G? One looks for infinitesimal transformations, i.e. one looks for the Lie algebra L that corresponds to G. Instead\nof looking for \"global\" transformations as in eq. (2) one looks for infinitesimal\nones. A one-parameter group of infinitesimal point transformations will have\nthe form\nx\u0303i\n\n=\n\n\u0169\u03b1\n\n=\n\nxi + \u03bb\u03bei (x, u) |\u03bb| << 1\n\nu\u03b1 + \u03bb\u03c6\u03b1 (x, u)\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 p,\n\n(3)\n1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 q.\n\nThe functions \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 must be found from the condition that \u0169(x\u0303) is a solution\nwhenever u(x) is one. The derivatives \u0169\u03b1,x\u0303i must be calculated using eq. (3)\nand will involve derivatives of \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 . A K-th derivative of \u0169\u03b1 with respect\nto the variable x\u0303i will involve derivatives of \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 up to order K. We then\nsubstitute the transformed quantities into eq. (1) and request that the equation\nbe satisfied for \u0169(x\u0303), whenever it is satisfied for u(x). Thus, terms of order \u03bb0\nwill drop out. Terms of order \u03bb will provide a system of determining equations\nfor \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 . Terms of order \u03bbk , k = 2, 3, . . . are to be ignored, since we are\nlooking for infinitesimal symmetries.\nThe functions \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 depend only on x and u, not on first, or higher\nderivatives, u\u03b1,xi , u\u03b1,xi xk , etc. This is actually the definition of \"point\" symmetries. The determining equations will explicitly involve derivatives of u\u03b1 , up\nto the order n (the order of the studied equation). The coefficients of all linearly\nindependent expressions in the derivatives must vanish separately. This provides\na system of determining equations for the functions \u03bei (x, u) and \u03c6\u03b1 (x, u). This\nis a system of linear partial differential equations of order n. The determining\nequations are linear, even if the original system (1) is nonlinear. This \"linearization\" is due to the fact that all terms of order \u03bbj , j \u2265 2, are ignored.\nThe system of determining equations is usually overdetermined, i.e. there are\nusually more determining equations than unknown functions \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 (p + q\nfunctions). The independent variables in the determining equations are x \u2208 Rp ,\nu \u2208 Rq .\nFor an overdetermined system, three possibilities occur.\n1. The only solution is the trivial one \u03bei = 0, \u03c6\u03b1 = 0, i = 1, . . . p, \u03b1 = 1, . . . , q.\nIn this case the symmetry algebra is L = {0}, the symmetry group is G = I\nand the symmetry method is to no avail.\n2. The general solution of the determining equations depends on a finite\nnumber K of constants. In this case the studied system (1) has a finitedimensional Lie point symmetry group and we have dim G = K.\n3. The general solution depends on a finite number of arbitrary functions of\nsome of the variables {xi , u\u03b1 }. In this case the symmetry group is infinite\ndimensional. This last case is of particular interest.\n3\n\n\fThe search for the symmetry algebra L of a system of differential equations is\nbest formulated in terms of vector fields acting on the space X\u00d7U of independent\nand dependent variables. Indeed, consider the vector field\nX=\n\np\nX\n\n\u03bei (x, u)\u2202xi +\n\nq\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x, u)\u2202u\u03b1 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 are the same as in eq. (3). If these functions are\nknown, the vector field (4) can be integrated to obtain the finite transformations\n(2). Indeed, all we have to do is integrate the equations\ndx\u0303i\n= \u03bei (x\u0303, \u0169),\nd\u03bb\n\nd\u0169\u03b1\n= \u03c6\u03b1 (x\u0303, \u0169),\nd\u03bb\n\n(5)\n\n\u0169\u03b1 |\u03bb=0 = u\u03b1 .\n\n(6)\n\nsubject to the initial conditions\nx\u0303i |\u03bb=0 = xi\n\nThis provides us with a one-parameter group of local Lie point transformations\nof the form (2) with \u03bb the group parameter.\nThe vector field (4) tells us how the variables x and u transform. We also\nneed to know how derivatives like ux , uxx , . . . transform. This is given by the\nprolongation of the vector field X.\nWe have\nX\nX\u001aX\n\u03c6x\u03b1i \u2202uxi +\n\u03c6x\u03b1i xk \u2202uxi xk\n(7)\npr X = X +\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\ni,k\n\n+\n\nxiX\nxk xl\ni,k,l\n\n\u001b\n\u03c6\u03b1 \u2202uxi xk xl + . . . ,\n\nwhere the coefficients in the prolongation can be calculated recursively, using\nthe total derivative operator\nDxi = \u2202xi + u\u03b1,xi \u2202u\u03b1 + u\u03b1,xa xi \u2202u\u03b1 ,xa + u\u03b1,xa xb xi \u2202u\u03b1 ,xa xb + . . .\n\n(8)\n\n(a summation over repeated indices is to be understood).\nThe recursive formulas are\n\u03c6x\u03b1i\nxi xk\n\u03c6\u03b1\nxi xk xl\n\u03c6\u03b1\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nDxi \u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 (Dxi \u03bea )u\u03b1,xa\nDxk \u03c6x\u03b1i \u2212 (Dxk \u03bea )u\u03b1,xi xa\nDxl \u03c6x\u03b1i xk\n\n(9)\n\n\u2212 (Dxl \u03bea )u\u03b1,xi xk xa\n\netc.\nb acts on functions of x, u and all derivatives of\nThe n-th prolongation of X\nu up to order n. It also tells us how derivatives transform. Thus, to obtain\nthe transformed quantities \u0169x\u0303i we must integrate eq. (5) with conditions (6),\ntogether with\nd\u0169x\u0303i\n(10)\n= \u03c6xi (x\u0303, \u0169, \u0169x\u0303 ), \u0169x\u0303 |\u03bb=0 = ux .\nd\u03bb\n4\n\n\fWe see that the coefficients of the prolonged vector field are expressed in terms\nof derivatives of \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 , the coefficients of the original vector field. They carry\nno new information: the transformation of derivatives is completely determined,\nonce the transformations of functions are known.\nThe invariance condition for the system (1) is expressed in terms of the\noperator (7) as\npr(n) XEa |E1 =...=EN =0 = 0,\n\na = 1, . . . N,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere pr(n) X is the prolongation (7) calculated up to order n where n is the\norder of the system (1).\nIn practice the symmetry algorithm consists of several steps, most of which\ncan be carried out on a computer. For early computer programs calculating\nsymmetry algebras, see Ref. [56, 9]. For a more recent review, see [25].\nThe individual steps are:\nb This depends\n1. Calculate all the coefficients in the n-th prolongation of X.\nonly on the order of the system (1), i.e. n, and on the number of independent and dependent variables, i.e. p and q.\n2. Consider the system (1) as a system of algebraic equations for x, u, ux ,\nuxx , etc. Choose N variables v1 , v2 , . . . vN and solve the system (1) for\nthese variables. The vi must satisfy the following conditions.\n(i) Each vi is a derivative of one u\u03b1 of at least order 1.\n(ii) The variables vi are all independent, none of them is a derivative of\nany other one.\niii) No derivatives of any of the vi figure in the system (1).\n3. Apply pr(n) X to all the equations in (1) and eliminate all expressions vi\nfrom the result. This provides us with the system (11).\n4. Determine all linearly independent expressions in the derivatives remaining in (11), once the quantities vi are eliminated. Set the coefficients of\nthese expressions equal to zero. This provides us with the determining\nequations, a system of linear partial differential equations of order n for\n\u03c6\u03b1 (x, u) and \u03bei (x, u).\n5. Solve the determining equations to obtain the symmetry algebra.\n6. Integrate the obtained vector fields to obtain the one-parameter subgroups\nof the symmetry group. Compose them appropriately to obtain the connected component Go of the symmetry group G.\n7. Extend the connected component Go to the full group G by adding all\ndiscrete transformations leaving the system (1) invariant. These discrete\ntransformations will form a finite, or discrete group GD . We have\n\u2283 Go\nG = GD \u00d7\ni.e. Go is an invariant subgroup of G.\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fLet us consider the case when at Step 5 we obtain a finite dimensional Lie\nalgebra L, i.e. a vector field X depending on K parameters, K \u2208 Z> , K < \u221e.\nWe can then choose a basis\n{X1 , X2 , . . . , XK }\n\n(13)\n\nof the Lie algebra L. The basis that is naturally obtained in this manner depends\non our integration procedure, though the algebra L itself does not. It is useful\nto transform the basis (13) to a canonical form in which all basis independent\nproperties of L are manifest. Thus, if L can be decomposed into a direct sum\nof indecomposable components,\nL = L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 LM ,\n\n(14)\n\nthen a basis should be chosen that respects this decomposition. The components\nLi that are simple should be identified according to the Cartan classification\n(over C) or the Gantmakher classification (over R) [47, 24]. The components\nthat are solvable should be so organized that their nilradical [52,32] is manifest.\nFor those components that are neither simple, nor solvable, the basis should be\nchosen so as to respect the Levi decomposition [52, 32].\nSo far we have considered only point transformations, as in eq. (2), in which\nthe new variables x\u0303 and \u0169 depend only on the old ones, x and u. More general\ntransformations are \"contact transformations\", where x\u0303 and \u0169 also depend on\nfirst derivatives of u. A still more general class of transformations are generalized\ntransformations, also called \"Lie-B\u00e4cklund\" transformations [48, 4]. For these\nwe have\nx\u0303 =\n\n\u039b\u03bb (x, u, ux , uxx, . . .)\n\n\u0169 =\n\n\u03a9\u03bb (x, u, ux , uxx , . . .)\n\n(15)\n\ninvolving derivatives up to an arbitrary order. The coefficients \u03bei and \u03c6\u03b1 of the\nvector fields (4) will then also depend on derivatives of u\u03b1 .\nWhen studying generalized symmetries, and sometimes also point symmetries, it is convenient to use a different formalism, namely that of evolutionary\nvector fields.\nLet us first consider the case of Lie point symmetries, i.e. vector fields of the\nform (4) and their prolongations (7). To each vector field (4) we can associate\nits evolutionary counterpart Xe , defined as\nXe\n\n=\n\nQ\u03b1\n\n=\n\nQ\u03b1 (x, u, ux )\u2202u\u03b1 ,\n\u2202u\u03b1\n\u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bei\n.\n\u2202xi\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nThe prolongation of the evolutionary vector field (16) is defined as\npr Xe\nQx\u03b1i\n\n= Q\u03b1 \u2202ua + Qx\u03b1i \u2202u\u03b1,xi + Qx\u03b1i xk \u2202u\u03b1,xi xk + . . .\n= Dxi Q\u03b1 , Qx\u03b1i xk = Dxi Dxk Q\u03b1 , . . . .\n6\n\n(18)\n\n\fThe functions Q\u03b1 are called the characteristics of the vector field. Notice that\nXe and pr Xe do not act on the independent variables xi .\nFor Lie point symmetries evolutionary and ordinary vector fields are entirely\nequivalent and it is easy to pass from one to the other. Indeed, eq. (17) gives\nthe connection between the two.\nThe symmetry algorithm for calculating the symmetry algebra L in terms\nof evolutionary vector fields is also equivalent. Eq. (11) is simply replaced by\npr(n) Xe Ea |E1 =...=EN =0 , = 0,\n\na = 1, . . . N.\n\n(19)\n\nThe reason that eq. (11) and (19) are equivalent is the following. It is easy to\ncheck that we have\npr(n) Xe = pr(n) X \u2212 \u03bei Di .\n(20)\nThe total derivative Di is itself a generalized symmetry of eq. (1), i.e. we\nhave\nDi Ea |E1 =E2 =...=En =0 , = 0 i = 1, . . . p, a = 1, . . . N.\n(21)\nEq. (20) and (21) prove that the systems (11) and (19) are equivalent. Eq. (21)\nitself follows from the fact that DEa = 0 is a differential consequence of eq. (1),\nhence every solution of eq. (1) is also a solution of eq. (21).\nTo find generalized symmetries of order k we use eq. (16) but allow the characteristics Q\u03b1 to depend on all derivatives of u\u03b1 up to order k. The prolongation\nis calculated using eq. (18). The symmetry algorithm is again eq. (19).\nA very useful property of evolutionary symmetries is that they provide compatible flows. This means that the system of equations\n\u2202u\u03b1\n= Q\u03b1\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(22)\n\nis compatible with the system (1). In particular, group invariant solutions, i.e.\nsolutions invariant under a subgroup of G are obtained as fixed points\nQ\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(23)\n\nIf Q\u03b1 is the characteristic of a point transformation then (23) is a system of\nquasilinear first order partial differential equations. They can be solved, the\nsolution substituted into (1) and this provides the invariant solutions explicitly.\n\n1.2\n\nComments on Symmetries of Difference Equations\n\nThe study of symmetries of difference equations is much more recent than that\nof differential equations. Early work in this direction is due to Maeda [44, 45]\nwho mainly studied transformations acting on the dependent variables only. A\nmore recent series of papers was devoted to Lie point symmetries of differentialdifference equations on fixed regular lattices [40, 41, 42, 23, 34, 33, 46, 50, 51, 8].\nA different approach was developed mainly for linear or linearizable difference\nequations and involved transformations acting on more than one point of the\n\n7\n\n\flattice [20, 21, 39, 28, 36]. The symmetries considered in this approach are really\ngeneralized ones, however they reduce to point ones in the continuous limit.\nA more general class of generalized symmetries has also been investigated\nfor difference equations, and differential-difference equations on fixed regular\nlattices [26, 27, 29, 35].\nA different approach to symmetries of discrete equations was originally suggested by V. Dorodnitsyn and collaborators [11, 13, 12, 5, 15, 14, 19, 16, 18, 17].\nThe main aim of this series of papers is to discretize differential equations while\npreserving their Lie point symmetries.\nSymmetries of ordinary and partial difference schemes on lattices that are\na priori given, but are allowed to transform under point transformations, were\nstudied in Ref. [37, 38, 43].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOrdinary Difference Schemes and Their Point\nSymmetries\nOrdinary Difference Schemes\n\nAn ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order n is a relation involving one\n\u2032\nindependent variable x, one dependent variable u = u(x) and n derivatives u,\n\u2032\u2032\nu, . . . u(n)\n\u2202E\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n6= 0.\n(24)\nE(x, u, u, u, . . . , u(n) ) = 0\n\u2202u(n)\nAn ordinary difference scheme (O\u2206S) involves two objects, a difference equation and a lattice. We shall specify an O\u2206S by a system of two equations, both\ninvolving two continuous variables x and u(x), evaluated at a discrete set of\npoints {xn }.\nThus, a difference scheme of order K will have the form\nn+N\nEa ({xk }n+N\nk=n+M , {uk }k=n+M ) = 0, a = 1, 2\nK = N \u2212 M + 1, n, M, N \u2208 Z, uk \u2261 u(xk ).\n\n(25)\n\nAt this stage we are not imposing any boundary conditions, so the reference\npoint xn can be arbitrarily shifted to the left, or to the right. The order K of\nthe system is the number of points involved in the scheme (25) and it is assumed\nto be finite. We also assume that if the values of xk and uk are specified in\n(N \u2212 M ) neighbouring point, we can calculate their values in the point to the\nright, or to the left of the given set, using equations (25).\nA continuous limit for the spacings between all neighbouring points going to\nzero, if it exists, will take one of the equations (25) into a differential equation\nof order K \u2032 \u2264 K, another into an identity (like 0 = 0).\nWhen taking the continuous limit it is convenient to introduce different quantities, namely differences between neighbouring points and discrete derivatives\n\n8\n\n\flike\nh+ (xn ) =\nu,x\n\n=\n\nu,xx\n\n=\n\nxn+1 \u2212 xn , h\u2212 (xn ) = xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ,\nun+1 \u2212 un\nun \u2212 un\u22121\n, u,x =\n,\nxn+1 \u2212 xn\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121\nu,x \u2212 u,x\n2\n,...\nxn+1 \u2212 xn\u22121\n\n(26)\n\nIn the continuous limit, we have\nh+ \u2192 0,\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nu,x \u2192u,\n\nh\u2212 \u2192 0,\n\nu,x \u2192u,\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nu,xx \u2192u .\n\nAs a clarifying example of the meaning of the difference scheme (25), let\nus consider a three point scheme that will approximate a second order linear\ndifference equation:\nE1\n\n=\n\nE2\n\n=\n\nun+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121\n\u2212 un = 0,\n(xn+1 \u2212 xn )2\nxn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 = 0.\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nThe solution of eq. E2 = 0, determines a uniform lattice\nxn = hn + x0\n\n(29)\n\nThe scale h and the origin x0 in eq. (29) are not fixed by eq. (28), instead they\nappear as integration constants, i.e. they are a priori arbitrary. Once they are\nchosen, eq. (27) reduces to a linear difference equation with constant coefficients,\nsince we have xn+1 \u2212 xn = h. Thus, a solution of eq. (27) will have the form\nun = \u03bbxn .\n\n(30)\n\nSubstituting (30) into (27) we obtain the general solution of the difference\nscheme (27), (28) as\nu(xn ) =\n\u03bb1,2\n\n=\n\nc1 \u03bbx1 n + c2 \u03bbx2 n , xn = hn + x0 ,\n!1/2\n\u221a\n2 + h2 \u00b1 h 4 + h2\n.\n2\n\n(31)\n\nThe solution (31) of the system (27), (28) depends on 4 arbitrary constants c1 ,\nc2 , h and x0 .\nNow let us consider a general three point scheme of the form\nEa (xn\u22121 , xn , xn+1 , un\u22121 , un , un+1 ) = 0,\n\na = 1, 2\n\n(32)\n\nsatisfying\ndet\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202(E1 , E2 )\n\u2202(xn+1 , un+1 )\n\n\u0013\n\n6= 0,\n\ndet\n9\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202(E1 , E2 )\n\u2202(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\n\n\u0013\n\n6= 0,\n\n(33)\n\n\f(possibly after an up or down shifting). The two conditions on the Jacobians\n(33) are sufficient to allow us to calculate (xn+1 , un+1 ) if (xn\u22121 , un\u22121 , xn , un )\nare given. Similarly, (xn\u22121 , un\u22121 ) can be calculated if (xn , un , xn+1 , un+1 ) are\ngiven. The general solution of the scheme (32) will hence depend on 4 arbitrary\nconstants and will have the form\nun\n\n=\n\nf (xn , c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 )\n\n(34)\n\nxn\n\n=\n\n\u03c6(n, c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 ).\n\n(35)\n\nA more standard approach to difference equations would be to consider a\nfixed equally spaced lattice e.g. with spacing h = 1. We can then identify the\ncontinuous variable x, sampled at discrete points xn , with the discrete variable\nn:\nxn = n.\n(36)\nInstead of a difference scheme we then have a difference equation\nE({uk }n+N\nk=n+M ) = 0,\n\n(37)\n\ninvolving K = N \u2212 M + 1 points. Its general solution has the form\nun = f (n, c1 , c2 , . . . cN \u2212M )\n\n(38)\n\ni.e. it depends on N \u2212 M constants.\nBelow, when studying point symmetries of discrete equations we will see the\nadvantage of considering difference systems like the system (25).\n\n2.2\n\nPoint Symmetries of Ordinary Difference Schemes\n\nIn this section we shall follow rather closely the article [37]. We shall define the\nsymmetry group of an ordinary difference scheme in the same manner as for\nODEs. That is, a group of continuous local point transformations of the form\n(2) taking solutions of the O\u2206S (25) into solutions of the same scheme. The\ntransformations considered are continuous, and we will adopt an infinitesimal\napproach, as in eq. (3). We drop the labels i and \u03b1, since we are considering\nthe case of one independent and one dependent variable only.\nAs in the case of differential equations, our basic tool will be vector fields of\nthe form (4). In the case of O\u2206S they will have the form\nX = \u03be(x, u)\u2202x + \u03c6(x, u)\u2202u\n\n(39)\n\nwith\nx \u2261 xn ,\n\nu \u2261 un = u(xn ).\n\nBecause we are considering point transformation, \u03be and \u03c6 in (39) depend on x\nand u at one point only.\n\n10\n\n\fThe prolongation of the vector field X is different than in the case of ODEs.\nInstead of prolonging to derivatives, we prolong to all points of the lattice figuring in the scheme (25). Thus we put\nn+N\nX\n\npr X =\n\nn+N\nX\n\n\u03be(xk , uk )\u2202xk +\n\nk=n+M\n\n\u03c6(xk , uk )\u2202uk .\n\n(40)\n\nk=n+M\n\nIn these terms the requirement that the transformed function \u0169(x\u0303) should satisfy\nthe same O\u2206S as the original u(x) is expressed by the requirement\npr XEa |E1 =E2 =0 = 0,\n\na = 1, 2.\n\n(41)\n\nSince we must respect both the difference equation and the lattice, we have\ntwo conditions (41) from which to determine \u03be(x, u) and \u03c6(x, u). Since each\nof these functions depends on a single point (x, u) and the prolongation (40)\nintroduces N \u2212 M + 1 points in space X \u00d7 U , the equation (41) will imply a\nsystem of determining equations for \u03be and \u03c6. Moreover, in general this will be\nan overdetermined system of linear functional equations that we transform into\nan overdetermined system of linear differential equations [1, 2].\nTo illustrate the method and the role of the choice of the lattice, let us start\nfrom a simple example. The example will be that of difference equations that\napproximate the ODE\n\u2032\u2032\nu= 0\n(42)\non several different lattices.\nFirst of all, let us find the Lie point symmetry group of the ODE (42), i.e.\nthe equation of a free particle on a line. Following the algorithm of Chapter 1,\nwe put\npr(2) X\n\n=\n\n\u03be\u2202x + \u03c6\u2202u + \u03c6x \u2202 \u2032 + \u03c6xx \u2202\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c6x\n\n=\n\n\u03c6xx\n\nDx \u03c6 \u2212 (Dx \u03be) u= \u03c6x + (\u03c6u \u2212 \u03bex ) u \u2212\u03beu u2\n\n=\n\n(43)\n\nu\n\nu\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nDx \u03c6x \u2212 (Dx \u03be) u= \u03c6xx + (2\u03c6xu \u2212 \u03bexx ) u\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n+(\u03c6uu \u2212 2\u03bexu )u2 \u2212 \u03beuu u3 x + (\u03c6u \u2212 2\u03bex ) u\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\n\u22123\u03beu v uu .\nThe symmetry formula (11) in this case reduces to\n\u03c6xx |\u2032\u2032\n\nu=0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= 0.\n\n(44)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nSetting the coefficients of u3 , u2 , u and (u0 ) equal to zero, we obtain an 8\ndimensional Lie algebra, isomorphic to sl(3, R) with basis\nX1\n\n= \u2202x ,\n\nX2 = x\u2202x ,\n\nX4\nX7\n\n= \u2202u , X5 = x\u2202u , X6 = u\u2202u ,\n= x(x\u2202x + u\u2202u ), X8 = u(x\u2202x + u\u2202u ).\n11\n\nX3 = u\u2202x\n\n(45)\n\n\fThis result was of course already known to Sophus Lie. Moreover, any\nsecond order ODE that is linear, or linearizable by a point transformation has a\nsymmetry algebra isomorphic to sl(3, R). The group SL(3, R) acts as the group\nof projective transformations of the Euclidean space E2 (with coordinates x, u)).\nNow let us consider some difference schemes that have eq. (42) as their\ncontinuous limit. We shall take the equation to be\nun+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121\n= 0.\n(xn+1 \u2212 xn )2\n\n(46)\n\nHowever before looking for the symmetry algebra, we multiply out the denominator and investigate the equivalent equation\nE1 = un+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121 = 0.\n\n(47)\n\nTo this equation we must add a second equation, specifying the lattice. We\nconsider three different examples at first glance quite similar, but leading to\ndifferent symmetry algebras.\nExample 1. Free particle (47) on a fixed uniform lattice. We take\nE2 = xn \u2212 hn \u2212 x0 = 0,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere h and x0 are fixed constants (that are not transformed by the group (e.g.\nh = 1, x0 = 0).\nApplying the prolonged vector field (40) to eq. (48) we obtain\n\u03be(xn , un ) = 0\n\n(49)\n\nfor all xn and un . Next, let us apply (40) to eq. (47) and replace xn , using (48)\nand un+1 , using (47). We obtain\n\u0001\n\u03c6 h(n + 1) + x0 , 2un \u2212 un\u22121 \u2212 2\u03c6(hn + x0 , un )\n\u0001\n(50)\n+\u03c6 h(n \u2212 1) + x0 , un\u22121 = 0.\n\nDifferentiating eq. (50) twice, once with respect to un\u22121 , once with respect to\nun , we obtain\n\u22022\n\u03c6(xn+1 , un+1 ) = 0\n(51)\n\u2202un+1\nand hence\n\u03c6(xn , un ) = A(xn )un + B(xn ).\n\n(52)\n\nWe substitute eq. (52) back into (50) and equate coefficients of un , un\u22121 and 1.\nThe result is\nA(n + 1) = A(n),\n\nB(n + 1) \u2212 2B(n) + B(n \u2212 1) = 0.\n\n(53)\n\nB = B1 n + B0 = b 1 x + b 0\n\n(54)\n\nHence we have\nA = A0 ,\n\n12\n\n\fwhere A0 , B1 , B0 , b1 and b0 are constants. We obtain the symmetry algebra of\nthe O\u2206S (47), (48) and it is only three-dimensional, spanned by\nX1 = \u2202u ,\n\nX2 = x\u2202u ,\n\nX3 = u\u2202u .\n\n(55)\n\nThe corresponding one parameter transformation groups are obtained by integrating these vector fields (see eq. (5), (6))\nG1\n\n: x\u0303 = x\n\nG2\n\n\u0169(x\u0303) = u(x) + \u03bb\n: x\u0303 = x\n\nG3\n\n\u0169(x\u0303) = u(x) + \u03bbx\n: x\u0303 = x\n\n(56)\n\n\u0169(x\u0303) = e\u03bb u(x)\nG1 and G2 just tell us that we can add an arbitrary solution of the scheme to\nany given solution, G3 corresponds to scale invariance of eq. (47).\nExample 2. Free particle (47) on a uniform two point lattice.\nInstead of eq. (48) we define a lattice by putting\nE2 = xn+1 \u2212 xn = h,\n\n(57)\n\nwhere h is a fixed (non-transforming) constant. Note that (57) tells us the\ndistance between any two neighbouring points but does not fix an origin (as\nopposed to eq. (48)).\nApplying the prolonged vector field (40) to eq. (57) and using (57), we obtain\n\u03be(xn + h, un+1 ) \u2212 \u03be(xn , un ) = 0.\n\n(58)\n\nSince un+1 and un are independent, eq. (58) implies \u03be = \u03be(x). Moreover \u03be(xn +\nh) = \u03be(x) so that we have\n(59)\n\u03be = \u03be0 = const .\nFurther, we apply pr X to eq. (47), and put un+1 = 2un \u2212 un\u22121 , xn+1 = xn + h,\nxn\u22121 = xn \u2212h in the obtained expressions. As in Example 1 we find that \u03c6(x, u)\nis linear in u as in (52) and ultimately satisfies\n\u03c6(x, u) = au + bx + c.\n\n(60)\n\nThe symmetry algebra in this case is four-dimensional. To the basis elements\n(55) we add translational invariance\nX4 = \u2202x .\n\n(61)\n\nExample 3. Free particle (47) on a uniform three-point lattice.\nLet us choose the lattice equation to be\nE2 = xn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 = 0.\n13\n\n(62)\n\n\fApplying pr X to E2 and substituting for xn+1 and un+1 , we find\n\u03be(2xn \u2212 xn\u22121 , 2un \u2212 un\u22121 ) \u2212 2\u03be(xn , un ) + \u03be(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 ) = 0.\n\n(63)\n\nDifferentiating twice with respect to un and un\u22121 , we obtain that \u03be is linear in\nu. Substituting \u03be = A(x)u + B(x) into (63) we obtain\n\u03be(xn , un ) = Aun + Bxn + C.\n\n(64)\n\nSimilarly, applying pr X to eq. (47), we obtain\n\u03c6(xn , un ) = Dun + Exn + F.\n\n(65)\n\nwhere A, . . ., F are constants. Finally, we obtain a six-dimensional symmetry\nalgebra for the O\u2206S (47), (62) with basis X1 , . . ., X6 as in eq. (45). It has been\nshown [16] that the entire sl(3, R) algebra cannot be recovered on any 3 point\nO\u2206S.\n\u00bfFrom the above examples we can draw the following conclusions.\n1. The Lie point symmetry group of an O\u2206S depends crucially on both\nequations in the system (25). In particular, if we choose a fixed lattice, as\nin eq. (48) (a \"one-point lattice\") we are left with point transformations\nthat act on the dependent variable only.\nIf we wish to preserve anything like the power of symmetry analysis for\ndifferential equations, we must either go beyond point symmetries to generalized ones, or use lattices that are also transformed and that are adapted\nto the symmetries we consider.\n2. The method for calculating symmetries of O\u2206S is reasonable straightforward. It will however involve solving functional equations.\nThe method can be summed up as follows\n1. Solve equations (25) for two of the quantities entering there, to make the\nequations explicit. For instance, take the system (32), (33). We can solve\ne.g. for xn+1 and un+1 and obtain\nxn+1\n\n= f1 (xn\u22121 , xn , un\u22121 , un )\n\nun+1\n\n= f2 (xn\u22121 , yn , un\u22121 , un )\n\n(66)\n\n2. Apply the prolonged vector field (40) to eq. (25) and substitute (66) for\nxn+1 , un+1 . We obtain two functional equations for \u03be and \u03c6 of the form\n\u001a\n\u2202Ea\n\u2202Ea\n\u2202Ea\n\u03be(f1 , f2 )\n+ \u03be(xn , un )\n+ \u03be(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\n\u2202xn+1\n\u2202xn\n\u2202xn\u22121\n\u2202Ea\n\u2202Ea\n+\u03c6(f1 , f2 )\n+ \u03c6(xu , un )\n(67)\n\u2202un+1\n\u2202un\n\u001b\n\u2202Ea\n+\u03c6(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\na = 1, 2\nxn+1 =f1 = 0\n\u2202un\u22121\nun+1 =f2\n14\n\n\f3. Assume that the functions \u03be, \u03c6, E1 and E2 are sufficiently smooth and\ndifferentiate eq. (67) with respect to the variables xk and uk so as to obtain\ndifferential equations for \u03be and \u03c6. If the original equations are polynomial\nin all quantities we can thus obtain single term differential equations form\n(67). These we must solve, then substitute back into (67) and solve this\nequation.\nWe will illustrate the procedure on several examples in Section 2.3.\n\n2.3\n\nExamples of Symmetry Algebras of O\u2206S\n\nExample 4. Monomial nonlinearity on a uniform lattice.\nLet us first consider the nonlinear ODE\n\u2032\u2032\n\nu \u2212uN = 0,\n\nN 6= 0, 1.\n\n(68)\n\nFor N 6= \u22123 eq. (68) is invariant under a two-dimensional Lie group, the Lie\nalgebra of which is given by\nX1 = \u2202x ,\n\nX2 = (N \u2212 1)x\u2202x \u2212 2u\u2202u\n\n(69)\n\n(translations and dilations). For N = \u22123 the symmetry algebra is threedimensional, isomorphic to sl(3, R), i.e. it contains a third element, additional\nto (69). A convenient basis for the symmetry algebra of the equation\n\u2032\u2032\n\nu \u2212u\u22123 = 0\n\n(70)\n\nis\nX1 = \u2202x ,\n\nX2 = 2x\u2202x + u\u2202u ,\n\nX3 = x(x\u2202x + u\u2202u ).\n\n(71)\n\nA very natural O\u2206S that has (68) as its continuous limit is\nE1\n\n=\n\nE2\n\n=\n\nun+1 \u2212 2un + un\u22121\n\u2212 uN\nn = 0\n(xn+1 \u2212 xn )2\nxn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 = 0\n\nN 6= 0, 1\n\n(72)\n(73)\n\nLet us now apply the symmetry algorithm described in Chapter 2.2 to the\nsystem (72) and (73). To illustrate the method, we shall present all calculations\nin detail.\nFirst of all, we choose two variables that will be substituted in eq. (41), once\nthe prolonged vector field (40) is applied to the system (72) and (73), namely\nxn+1\nun+1\n\n= 2xn \u2212 xn\u22121\n\n= (xn \u2212\n\nxn\u22121 )2 uN\nn\n\n(74)\n+ 2un \u2212 un\u22121\n\nWe apply pr X of (40) to eq. (73) and obtain\n\u03be(xn+1 , un+1 ) \u2212 2\u03be(xn , un ) + \u03be(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 ) = 0\n15\n\n(75)\n\n\fwhere, xn , un xn\u22121 , un\u22121 are independent, but xn+1 , un+1 are expressed in\nterms of these quantities, as in eq. (74). Taking this into acccount, we differentiate (75) first with respect to un\u22121 , then un . We obtain successively\n\u2212 \u03be,un+1 (xn+1 , un+1 ) + \u03be,un\u22121 (xn\u22121 , un\u22121 ) =\n\n{N (xn \u2212\n\n\u22121\nxn\u22121 )2 uN\nn\n\n+ 2}\u03be,un+1 un+1 (xn+1 , un+1 ) =\n\n0\n\n(76)\n\n0.\n\n(77)\n\nEq. (77) is the desired one-term equation. It implies\n\u03be(x, u) = a(x)u + b(x)\n\n(78)\n\nSubstituting (78) into (76) we obtain\n\u2212 a(2xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) + a(xn\u22121 ) = 0.\n\n(79)\n\nDifferentiating with respect to xn , we obtain a = a0 = const. Finally, we\nsubstitute (78) with a = a0 into (75) and obtain\na = 0,\n\nb(2xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) \u2212 2b(xn ) + b(xn\u22121 ) = 0\n\n(80)\n\nand hence\n\u03be = b = b1 x + b0\n\n(81)\n\nwhere b0 and b1 are constants. To obtain the function \u03c6(xn , un ), we apply pr X\nto eq. (72) and obtain\n\u03c6(xn+1 , un+1 ) \u2212 2\u03c6(xn , un ) + \u03c6(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\n\u22121\n\u2212(xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )2 [N \u03c6(xn , un )uN\n+ 2b1 uN\nn\nn ] = 0. (82)\nDifferentiating successively with respect to un\u22121 and un (taking (74) into account) we obtain\n\u2212 \u03c6,un+1 (xn+1 , un+1 ) + \u03c6,un\u22121 (xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\n{N (xn \u2212\n\nxn\u22121 )2 uN\nn\n\n+ 2}\u03c6,un+1 un+1\n\n= 0\n\n(83)\n\n= 0\n\n(84)\n\nand hence\n\u03c6 = \u03c61 u + \u03c60 (x),\n\n\u03c61 = const .\n\n(85)\n\nEq. (82) now reduces to\n\u03c60 (2xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) \u2212 2\u03c60 (xn ) + \u03c60 (xn\u22121 )\n\u2212(xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )2 {(N \u2212 1)\u03c61 + 2b1 }uN\nn\n\u22121\n\u2212N (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )2 \u03c60 uN\n= 0.\nn\n\n(86)\n\nWe have N 6= 0, 1 and hence (86) implies\n\u03c60 = 0,\n\n(N \u2212 1)\u03c61 + 2b1 = 0.\n\n(87)\n\nWe have thus proven that the symmetry algebra of the O\u2206S (72) and (73) is\nthe same as that of the ODE (68), namely the algebra (69).\n16\n\n\fWe mention that the value N = \u22123 is not distinguished here and the system\n(72) and (73) is not invariant under SL(3, R) for N = \u22123. Actually, a difference scheme invariant under SL(3, R) does exist and it will have eq. (70) as its\ncontinuous limit. It will however not have the form (71) and the lattice will not\nbe uniform [16, 18].\nHad we taken a two-point lattice, xn+1 \u2212 xn = h with h fixed, instead of\nE2 = 0 as in (73), we would only have obtained translational invariance for the\nequation (72) and lost the dilational invariance represented by X2 of eq. (69).\nExample 5.

(88) and (89) is\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nu \u2212f (u) = 0\n\n(91)\n\nand is invariant under a two-dimensional group with Lie algebra\nX1 = \u2202x ,\n\nX2 = \u2202u\n\n(92)\n\n\u2032\n\nfor any function f (u). For certain functions f the symmetry group is threedimensional, where the additional basis element of the Lie algebra is\nX3 = (ax + bu)\u2202x + (cx + du)\u2202u .\nThe matrix\nM=\n\n\u0012\n\na b\nc d\n\n(93)\n\n\u0013\n\n(94)\n\ncan be transformed to Jordan canonical form and a different function f (z) is\nobtained for each canonical form.\nNow let us consider the discrete system (88) and (89). Before applying pr X\nto this system we choose two variables to substitute in eq. (41), namely\nxn+1\nun+1\n\n= 2xn \u2212 xn\u22121\n= 2un \u2212 un\u22121 + (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )2 f\n\n\u0012\n\nun \u2212 un\u22121\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n(95)\n.\n\nApplying pr X to eq. (89) we obtain eq. (75) with xn+1 and un+1 as in eq. (95).\nDifferentiating twice, with respect to un\u22121 and un respectively, we obtain\n\u03be,un+1 un+1 [1 + (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )f \u2032 ][2 + (xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )f \u2032 ] + \u03be,un+1 f \u2032\u2032 = 0.\n17\n\n(96)\n\n\fFor f \u2032\u2032 6= 0 the only solution is \u03be,un+1 = 0, i.e. \u03be = \u03be(x). Substituting back into\n(75), we obtain\n\u03be = \u03b1x + \u03b2\n(97)\nwith \u03b1 = const, \u03b2 = const.\nNow let us apply pr X to E1 of eq. (88) and (89) and replace xn+1 , un+1 as\nin eq (95). We obtain the equation\n\u03c6(xn+1 , un+1 ) \u2212 2\u03c6(xn , un ) + \u03c6(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 ) = 2\u03b1(xn \u2212 xn\u22121 )2 f (z)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6(xn , un ) \u2212 \u03c6(xn\u22121 , un\u22121 )\n2 \u2032\n+(xn \u2212 xn\u22121 ) f (z)\n\u2212 \u03b1z (98)\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121\nwith \u03b1 as in eq. (97). Thus, we only need to distinguish between \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b1 = 1. Eq. (98) is a functional equation, involving two unknown functions \u03c6\nand f . There are only four independent variables involved, xn , xn\u22121 , un and\nun\u22121 . We simplify (98) by introducing new variables {x, u, h, z}, putting\nxn\nun\n\n=\n=\n\nx,\n\nxn+1 = x + h,\n\nu,\n\nxn\u22121 = x \u2212 h\n\nun\u22121 = u \u2212 hz,\n\n(99)\n2\n\nun+1 = u + hz + h f (z),\n\nwhere we have used eq. (95) and defined\nz=\n\nun \u2212 un\u22121\nxn \u2212 xn\u22121\n\nh = xn+1 \u2212 xn .\n\n(100)\n\nEq. (98) in these variables is\n\u0001\n\u03c6 x + h, u + hz + h2 f (z) \u2212 2\u03c6(x, u) + \u03c6(x \u2212 h, u \u2212 hz)\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c6(x, u) \u2212 \u03c6(x \u2212 h, u \u2212 hz)\n2\n2 \u2032\n\u2212 \u03b1z . (101)\n= 2\u03b1h f (z) + h f (z)\nh\nFirst of all, we notice that for any function f (z) we have two obvious symmetry elements, namely X1 and X2 of eq. (92), corresponding to \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 1\nin (101) (and (97)) and \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = 1, respectively. Eq. (101) is quite difficult\nto solve directly. However, any three-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields in\n2 variables, containing {X1 , X2 } of eq. (92) as a subalgebra, must have X3 of\neq. (93) as its third element. Moreover, eq. (97) shows that we have b = 0 in\neq. (93) and (94). In (101) we put \u03b1 = a and\n\u03c6(x, u) = cx + du.\n\n(102)\n\nSubstituting into eq. (101) we obtain\n(d \u2212 2a)f (z) = [c + (d \u2212 a)z]f \u2032 (z).\n\n(103)\n\n\u00bfFrom eq. (103) we obtain two types of solutions:\nFor d 6= a we have\nf = f0 [(d \u2212 a)z + c](d\u22122a)/(d\u2212a) ,\n18\n\nc 6= 0.\n\n(104)\n\n\fFor d = a, we have\nf = f0 e\u2212(a/c)x .\n\n(105)\n\nWith no loss of generality we could have taken the matrix (94) with b = 0\nto Jordan cannonical form and we would have obtained two different cases,\nsimplifying (104) and (105), respectively. They are\nf\n\n=\n\nf0 z N ,\n\nf\n\n=\n\nf0 e\u2212z ,\n\nN \u22122\nu\u2202u,\nN \u22121\nX3 = x\u2202x + (x + u)\u2202u.\n\nX3 = x\u2202x +\n\nN 6= 1\n\n(106)\n(107)\n\nThe result can be stated as follows. The O\u2206S (88) and (89) is always invariant\nunder the group generated by {X1 , X2 } as in (92). It is invariant under a threedimensional group with algebra including X3 as in eq. (93) if f satisfies eq. (103),\ni.e. has the form (106), or (107). These two cases also exist in the continuous\nlimit. However, one more case exists in the continuous limit, namely\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nu= 1 + (u)2\nwith\n\n\u00013/2\n\n\u2032\n\nek arctan u\n\nX3 = (kx + u)\u2202x + (ku \u2212 x)\u2202u.\n\n(108)\n(109)\n\nThis equation can also be discretized in a symmetry preserving way [16], not\nhowever on the uniform lattice (89).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nLie Point Symmetries of Partial Difference Schemes\nPartial Difference Schemes\n\nIn this chapter we generalize the results of Chapter 2 to the case of two discretely\nvarying independent variables. We follow the ideas and notation of Ref. [38].\nThe generalization to n variables is immediate, though cumbersome. Thus,\nwe will consider a Partial Difference Scheme (P\u2206S), involving one continuous\nfunction of two continuous variables u(x, t). The variables (x, t) are sampled\non a two-dimensional lattice, itself defined by a system of compatible relations\nbetween points. Thus, a lattice will be an a priori infinite set of points Pi lying\nin the real plane R2 . The points will be labelled by two discrete subscripts Pm,n\nwith \u2212\u221e < m < \u221e, \u2212\u221e < n < \u221e. The cartesian coordinates of the point Pmn\nwill be denoted (xmn , tmn ) [or similarly any other coordinates (\u03b1mn , \u03b2mn )].\nA two-variable P\u2206S will be a set of five relations between the quantities\n{x, t, u} at a finite number of points. We choose a reference point Pmn \u2261 P\nand two families of curves intersecting at the points of the lattice. The labels\nm = m0 and n = n0 will parametrize these curves (see Fig 1). To define an\norientation of the curves, we specify\nxm+1n \u2212 xm,n \u2261 hm > 0,\nat the original reference point.\n19\n\ntmn+1 \u2212 tmn \u2261 hn > 0\n\n(110)\n\n\fFigure 1:\nThe actual curves and the entire P\u2206S are specified by the 5 relations\nEa ({xm+i,n+j , tm+i,n+j , um+i,n+j }) = 0\n1 \u2264 a \u2264 5 i1 \u2264 i \u2264 i2 ji \u2264 j \u2264 j2 .\n\n(111)\n\nIn the continuous limit, if one exists, all five equations (111) are supposed\nto reduce to a single PDE, e.g. E1 = 0 can reduce to the PDE and Ea = 0,\na \u2265 2 to 0 = 0. The orthogonal uniform lattice of Fig. 2 is clearly a special case\nof that on Fig. 1.\nSome independence conditions must be imposed on the system (111) e.g.\n|J| =\n\n\u2202(E1 , . . . , E5 )\n6= 0.\n\u2202(xm+i2 ,n , tm+i2 n , xm,n+j2 , tm,n+j2 , um+i2 ,n+j2 )\n\n(112)\n\nThis condition allows us to move upward and to the right along the curves\npassing through Pm,n . Moreover, compatibility of the five equations (111) must\nbe assured.\nAs an example of a P\u2206S let us consider the linear heat equation on a uniform\nand orthogonal lattice. The heat equation in the continuous case is\nut = uxx .\n\n(113)\n\nAn approximation on a uniform orthogonal lattice is given by the five equations\numn+1 \u2212 umn\num+1n \u2212 2umn + um\u22121n\nE1 =\n\u2212\n=0\n(114)\nh2\n(h1 )2\n20\n\n\ft\n\n\u2763\n\nn+1\n\nn\n\n\u2763\n\n\u2707\n\nm\n\nm\u22121\n\n\u2763\n\nm+1\n\nx\n\nFigure 2:\nE2\nE4\n\n=\n=\n\nxm+1,n \u2212 xm,n \u2212 h1 = 0\nE3 = tm+1,n \u2212 tm,n = 0\nxm,n+1 \u2212 xmn = 0\nE5 = tm,n+1 \u2212 tm,n \u2212 h2 = 0.\n\n(115)\n(116)\n\nEquations (115) can of course be integrated to give the standard expressions\nxmn = h1 m + x0\n\ntmn = h2 n + t0 .\n\n(117)\n\nNotice that h1 and h2 are constants that cannot be scaled (they are fixed in\neq. (115). On the other hand (x0 , t0 ) are integration constants and are thus\nnot fixed by the system (115), (116). As written, these equations are invariant\nunder translations, but not under dilations.\nFinally, we remark that the usual fixed lattice condition is obtained from\n(116) by putting x0 = t0 = 0, h1 = h2 = 1 and identifying\nx = m,\n\nt = n.\n\n(118)\n\nThough the above example is essentially trivial, it brings out several points.\n1. Four equations are indeed needed to specify a two-dimensional lattice and\nto allow us to move along the coordinate lines.\n2. In order to solve the P\u2206S (114), (115) for h1 and h2 given, we must\nspecify for instance {xmn , tmn , umn , um+1,n , um\u22121n }. Then we can directly\ncalculate {xm+1,n , tm+1n }, {xmn+1 , tm,n+1 } from eq. (115). In order to\ncalculate the coordinates of the fourth point figuring in eq. (114), namely\n{xmn\u22121 , tm,n\u22121 } we must shift eq. (115) down by one unit in m.\n3. The Jacobian condition (112) allowing us to perform these calculations, is\nobviously satisfied, since we have\n\u2202(E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 , E5 )\n= 1.\n\u2202(xm+1,n , tm+1,n , xm,n+1 , tmn+1 , umn+1 )\n21\n\n(119)\n\n\fA partial difference scheme with one dependent and n independent variables\nwill involve n2 + 1 relations between the variables (x1 , x2 , . . . xn , u), evaluated\nat a finite number of points.\n\n3.2\n\nSymmetries of Partial Difference Schemes\n\nAs in the case of O\u2206S treated in Chapter 2, we shall restrict ourselves to point\ntransformations\nx\u0303 = F\u03bb (x, t, u)\n\nt\u0303 = G\u03bb (x, t, u),\n\n\u0169 = H\u03bb (x, t, u).\n\n(120)\n\nThe requirement is that \u0169\u03bb (x\u0303, t\u0303) should be a solution, whenever it is defined and\nwhenever u(x, t) is a solution. The group action (120) should be defined and\ninvertible, at least locally, in some neighbourhood of the reference point Pmn ,\nincluding all points Pm+i,n+j involved in the system (111).\nAs in the case of a single independent variable we shall consider infinitesimal transformations that allow us to use Lie algebraic techniques. Instead of\ntransformations (120) we consider\nx\u0303\n\n= x + \u03bb\u03be(x, t, u),\n\nt\u0303\n\u0169\n\n= t + \u03bb\u03c4 (x, t, u),\n= u + \u03bb\u03c6(x, t, u) |\u03bb| << 1.\n\n(121)\n\nOnce the functions \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6 are determined from the invariance requirement, then the actual transformations (120) are determined by integration, as\nin eq. (5), (6).\nThe transformations act on the entire space (x, t, u), at least locally. This\nmeans that the same function F , G and H in eq. (120), or \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6 in eq. (121)\ndetermine the transformations of all points.\nWe formulate the problem of determining the symmetries (121), and ultimately (120), in terms of a Lie algebra of vector fields of the form\nb = \u03be(x, t, u)\u2202x + \u03c4 (x, t, u)\u2202t + \u03c6(x, t, u)\u2202u ,\nX\n\n(122)\n\nwhere \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6 are the same as in eq. (121). The operator (122) acts at one\npoint only, namely (x, t, u) \u2261 (xmn , tmn , umn ). Its prolongation will act at all\npoints figuring in the system(111) and we put\nX\npr X =\n[\u03be(xjk , tjk , ujk )\u2202xjk + \u03c4 (xjk , tjk , ujk )\u2202tjk\n(123)\nj,k\n\n+\u03c6(xjk , tjk , ujk )\u2202ujk ],\n\nwhere the sum is over all points figuring in eq. (111). To simplify notation we\nput\n\u03bejk\n\u03c6jk\n\n\u2261 \u03be(xjk , tjk , ujk ),\n\u2261 \u03c6(xjk , tjk , ujk ).\n22\n\n\u03c4jk \u2261 \u03c4 (xjk , tjk , ujk )\n\n(124)\n\n\fThe functions \u03be, \u03c4 , and \u03c6 figuring in eq. (122) and (123) are determined\nfrom the invariance condition\nb a |E1 =...=E5 =0 = 0 a = 1, . . . 5.\npr XE\n\n(125)\n\nIt is eq. (125) that provides an algorithm for determining the symmetry\nalgebra, i.e. the coefficients \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6.\nThe procedure is the same as in the case of ordinary difference schemes,\ndescribed in Chapter 2. In the case of the system (111), we proceed as follows:\n1. Choose 5 variables va to eliminate from the condition (125) and express\nthem in terms of the other variables, using the system (111) and the\nJacobian condition (112). For instance, we can choose\nv1\n\n=\n\nxm+i2 ,n ,\n\nv2 = tm+i2 ,n\n\nv3\n\n=\n\nxm,n+j2 ,\n\nv4 = tm,n+j2 ,\n\n(126)\nv5 = um+i2 ,j+i2\n\nand use (111) to express\nva = va (xm+i,n+j , tm+i,n+j , um+i,n+j )\ni1 \u2264 i \u2264 i2 \u2212 1,\n\nj1 \u2264 j \u2264 j2 \u2212 1.\n\n(127)\n\nThe quanties va must be chosen consistently. None of them can be a\nshifted value of another one (in the same direction). No relations between\nthe quantities va should follow from the system (111). Once eliminated\nfrom eq. (124), they should not reappear due to shifts. For instance, the\nchoice (126) is consistent if m + i2 and n + j2 are the highest values of\nthese labels that figure in eq. (111).\n2. Once the quantities va are eliminated from the system (125), using (127),\neach remaining value of xi,k , ti,k and ui,k is independent. Each of them\ncan figure in the corresponding functions \u03beik , \u03c4ik , \u03c6ik (see eq. (124)), in\nthe functions Ea directly, or via the expressions va , in the functions \u03be,\n\u03c4 and \u03c6 with different labels. This provides a system of five functional\nequations for \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6.\n3. Assume that the dependence of \u03be, \u03c4 and \u03c6 on x, t and u is analytic.\nConvert the obtained functional equations into differential equations by\ndifferentiating with respect to xik , tik , or uik . This provides an overdetermined system of differential equations that we must solve. If possible, use\nmultiple differentiations to obtain single term differential equations that\nare easy to solve.\n4. Substitute the solution of the differential equations back into the original functional equations and solve these. The differential equations are\nconsequences of the functional ones and will hence have more solutions.\nThe functional equations will provide further restrictions on the constants\nand arbitrary functions obtained when integrating the differential consequences.\nLet us now consider examples on different lattices.\n23\n\n\f3.3\n3.3.1\n\nThe Discrete Heat Equation\nThe Continuous Heat Equation\n\nThe symmetry group of the continuous heat equation (113) is well known [48].\nIts symmetry algebra has the structure of a semidirect sum\n\u2283 L1 ,\nL = L0 +\n\n(128)\n\nwhere L0 is six-dimensional and L1 is an infinite dimensional ideal representing\nthe linear superposition principle (present for any linear PDE). A convenient\nbasis for this algebra is given by the vector fields\nP0\nK\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2202t , D = 4t\u2202t + 2x\u2202x + u\u2202u\n4t(t\u2202t + x\u2202x ) + (x2 + 2t)u\u2202u\n\nP1\nS\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2202x , B = 2t\u2202x + xu\u2202u , W = u\u2202u\nS(x, t)\u2202u , St \u2212 Sxx = 0.\n\n(129)\n(130)\n\nThe sl(2, R) subalgebra {P0 , D, K} represents time translations, dilations and\n\"expansions\". The Heisenberg subalgebra {P1 , B, W } represents space translations, Galilei boosts and the possibility of multiplying a solution u by a constant.\nThe presence of Sb simply tells us that we can add a solution to any given soluc reflect linearity, Pb0 and Pb1 the fact that the equation is\ntion. Thus, Sb and W\nautonomous (constant coefficients).\n3.3.2\n\nDiscrete Heat Equation on Fixed Rectangular Lattice\n\nLet us consider the discrete heat equation (114) on the four point uniform\northogonal lattice (115), (116). We apply the prolonged operator (113) to the\nequations for the lattice and obtain\n\u03be(xm+1n , tm+1n , um+1n ) \u2212 \u03be(xmn , tmn , umn ) = 0\n\u03be(xm,n+1 , tm,n+1 , um,n+1 ) \u2212 \u03be(xmn , tmn , umn ) = 0\n\n(131)\n\nand similarly for \u03c4 (x, t, u). The quantities vi of eq. (126) can be chosen to be\nv1 = xm+1,n\n\nv2 = tm+1,n\n\nv4 = tm,n+1 ,\n\nv3 = xm,n+1 ,\n\nv5 = um,n+1 .\n\n(132)\n\nHowever, in (131) um+1,n and um,n+1 cannot be expressed in terms of umn ,\nsince eq. (114) also involves um\u22121,n . Differentiating (131) with respect to e.g.\numn . we find that \u03be cannot depend on u:\n\u2202\u03be(xmn , tmn , umn )\n= 0.\n\u2202umn\n\n(133)\n\nSince we have tn+1n = tmn and xmn+1 = xmn the two equations (131) yield\n\u2202\u03bemn\n= 0,\n\u2202tmn\n\n\u2202\u03bemn\n= 0,\n\u2202xmn\n24\n\n(134)\n\n\frespectively. The same is obtained for the coefficient \u03c4 , so finally we have\n\u03be = \u03be0 ,\n\n\u03c4 = \u03c40 ,\n\n(135)\n\nwhere \u03be0 and \u03c40 are constants.\nNow let us apply pr X to eq. (114). We obtain\n\u03c6mn+1 \u2212 \u03c6mn \u2212\n\nh2\n(\u03c6m+1n \u2212 2\u03c6mn + \u03c6m\u22121,n ) = 0.\n(h1 )2\n\n(136)\n\nIn more detail, eliminating the quantities va in eq (132) we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh2\n\u03c6 xmn , tmn + h2 , um,n + 2 (um+1,n \u2212 2um,n + um\u22121,n )\nh1\nh2\n\u2212\u03c6(xm,n , tm,n , um,n ) \u2212 2 [\u03c6(xmn + h1 , tmn , um+1,n ) \u2212 2\u03c6(xm,n , tm,n , um,n )\nh1\n+\u03c6(xmn \u2212 h1 , tmn , um\u22121,n )] = 0.\n(137)\nWe differentiate eq. (137) twice, with respect to um+1,n and um\u22121,n respectively.\nWe obtain\n\u2202 2 \u03c6mn+1\n= 0,\n(138)\n\u2202u2m,n+1\nthat is\n\u03c6mn = A(xmn , tm,n )umn + B(xm,n , tm,n ).\n\n(139)\n\nWe substitute \u03c6mn of eq. (139) back into eq. (137) and set the coefficients\nof um+1,n , umn , um\u22121n and 1 equal to zero separately. From the resulting\ndetermining equations we find that A(xmn , tmn ) = A0 must be constant and\nthat B(x, t) must satisfy the discrete heat equation (114). The result is that the\nsymmetry algebra of the system (114) - (116) is very restricted. It is generated\nby\nP0 = \u2202t , P1 = \u2202x , W = u\u2202u , S = S(x, t)\u2202u\n(140)\nand reflects only the linearity of the system and the fact that it is autonomous.\nThe dilations, expansions and Galilei boosts, generated by D, K and B of\neq. (129) in the continuous case are absent on the lattice (115) and (116). Other\nlattices will allow other symmetries.\n3.3.3\n\nDiscrete Heat Equation Invariant Under Dilations\n\nLet us now consider a five-point lattice that is also uniform and orthogonal. We\nput\num,n+1 \u2212 um,n\num+1n \u2212 2um,n + um\u22121n\n=\ntm,n+1 \u2212 tm,n\n(xm+1,n \u2212 xm,n )2\nxm+1n \u2212 2xmn + xm\u22121n = 0\nxmn+1 \u2212 xmn = 0\ntm+1n \u2212 tmn = 0\ntm,n+1 \u2212 2tm,n + tm,n\u22121 = 0.\n25\n\n(141)\n(142)\n(143)\n\n\fThe variables va that we shall substitute from eq. (141), (142) and (143) are\nxm+1,n , tm+1,n , xm,n+1 , tm,n+1 and um,n+1 . Applying pr X to eq. (142) we\nobtain\n\u03be(2xmn \u2212 xm\u22121,n , tmn , um+1,n ) \u2212 2\u03be(xmn , tmn , umn )\n\n+\u03be(xm\u22121,n , tmn , um\u22121,n ) = 0\n\u03be(xmn , 2tm,n \u2212 tmn\u22121 , um,n+1 ) \u2212 \u03be(xmn , tmn , umn ) = 0.\n\n(144)\n(145)\n\nIn eq. (145) umn and um,n+1 are independent. Differentiating with respect to\numn we find \u2202\u03bemn /\u2202umn = 0 and hence \u03be does not depend on u. Differentiating\n(145) with respect to tmn\u22121 we obtain \u2202\u03bem,n+1 /\u2202tm,n+1 = 0. Thus, \u03be depends\non x alone. Eq. (144) can then be solved and we find that \u03be is linear in x.\nApplying pr X to eq. (143) we obtain similar results for \u03c4 (x, t, u). Finally,\ninvariance of the lattice equations (142) and (143) implies:\n\u03be = ax + b,\n\n\u03c4 = ct + d.\n\n(146)\n\nLet us now apply pr X to eq. (141). We obtain, after using the P\u2206S (141) (143)\n\u03c6mn+1 \u2212 \u03c6mn\n\u03c6m+1n \u2212 2\u03c6mn + \u03c6m\u22121n\n\u2212\ntm,n+1 \u2212 tm,n\n(xm+1,n \u2212 xm,n )2\num+1,n \u2212 2umn + um\u22121,n\n= 0. (147)\n+(2a \u2212 c)\n(xm+1n \u2212 xmn )2\nNotice that um,n+1 (and hence \u03c6m,n+1 ) depends on um+1,n and um\u22121,n , whereas\nall terms in eq. (147) depend on at most one of these quantities. Taking the\nsecond derivative \u2202um+1,n \u2202um\u22121,n of eq. (147), we find\n\u2202 2 \u03c6m,n+1\n= 0, i.e. \u03c6 = A(x, t)u + B(x, t).\n\u2202um,n+1\n\n(148)\n\nWe substitute this expression back into (147) and find\nA(x, t) = A0 = const\n\n(149)\n\nand see that B(x, t) must satisfy the system (141)\u2013(143). Moreover, we find\nc = 2a in eq. (146). Finally, the symmetry algebra has the basis\nP0\nS\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2202t , P1 = \u2202x ,\nS(x, t)\u2202u.\n\nW = u\u2202u ,\n\nD = x\u2202x + 2t\u2202t\n\n(150)\n(151)\n\nThus, dilational invariance is recovered, not however Galilei invariance. Other\nsymmetries can be recovered on other lattices.\n\n3.4\n3.4.1\n\nLorentz Invariant Difference Schemes\nThe Continuous Case\n\nLet us consider the PDE\nuxx \u2212 utt = 4f (u).\n26\n\n(152)\n\n\fEq. (152) is invariant under the Poincar\u00e9 group of 1 + 1 dimensional Minkowski\nspace for any function f (u). Its Lie algebra is represented by\nP0 = \u2202t ,\n\nP1 = \u2202x ,\n\nL = t\u2202x + x\u2202t .\n\n(153)\n\nFor specific interactions f (u) the symmetry algebra may be larger, in particular\nfor f = eu , f = uN , or f = \u03b1u + \u03b2.\nBefore presenting a discrete version of eq. (152), we find it convenient to\npass over to light cone coordinates\ny = x + t,\n\nz =x\u2212t\n\n(154)\n\nin which eq. (152) is rewritten as\nuyz = f (u)\n\n(155)\n\nand the Poincar\u00e9 symmetry algebra (153) is\nP1 = \u2202y ,\n3.4.2\n\nP2 = \u2202z ,\n\nL = y\u2202y \u2212 z\u2202z .\n\n(156)\n\nA Discrete Lorentz Invariant Scheme\n\nA particular P\u2206S that has eq. (155) as its continuous limit is\num+1n+1 \u2212 umn+1 \u2212 um+1n + umn\n= f (umn )\n(ym+1n \u2212 ymn )(zmn+1 \u2212 zmn )\nym+1n \u2212 2ymn + ym\u22121n = 0 ymn+1 \u2212 ymn = 0\nzm+1n \u2212 zmn = 0 zmn+1 \u2212 2zmn + zmn\u22121 = 0.\n\n(157)\n(158)\n(159)\n\nTo find the Lie point symmetries of this difference scheme, we put\nX = \u03b7(y, z, u)\u2202y + \u03be(y, z, u)\u2202z + \u03c6(y, z, u)\u2202u .\n\n(160)\n\nWe apply the prolonged vector field pr x\nb first to eq. (158) and (159), eliminate\nym+1n , ym,n+1 , zm+1n and zm,n+1 , using the system (158), (159) and notice that\nall uik that figure in the obtained equations for \u03b7ik and \u03beik are independent.\nThe result that we obtain is that \u03b7 and \u03be must be independent of u and\nlinear in y and z, respectively. Finally we obtain\n\u03be = \u03b1y + \u03b3,\n\n\u03b7 = \u03b2z + \u03b4\n\n(161)\n\n(\u03b1, . . . , \u03b4 are constants). Invariance of eq. (157) implies that the coefficient \u03c6 in\nthe vector field (160) must be linear in u and moreover have the form\n\u03c6 = Au + B(y, z)\n\n(162)\n\nwhere A is a constant. Taking (161) and (162) into account and applying pr X\nto eq. (157), we obtain\n(A \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)f (umn ) +\n\nBm+1n+1 \u2212 Bmn+1 \u2212 Bm+1n + Bmn\n(ym+1,n \u2212 ymn )(zmn+1 \u2212 zmn )\n= (Aumn + Bmn )f \u2032 (umn ).\n27\n\n(163)\n\n\fDifferentiating eq. (163) with respect to umn we finally obtain the following\ndetermining equation:\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\n\ndf\nd2 f\n+ [Aumn + B(ymn , zmn )] 2 = 0.\ndumn\ndumn\n\n(164)\n\nFor f (umn ) arbitrary, we find \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1, A = B = 0. Thus for arbitrary f (u)\nthe scheme (157)\u2013(158) has the same symmetries as its continuous limit. The\npoint symmetry algebra is given by eq. (156), i.e. it generates, translations and\nLorentz transformations.\nNow let us find special cases of f (u) when further symmetries exist. That\nmeans that eq. (164) must be solved in a nontrivial manner. Let us restrict\nourselves to the case when the interaction is nonlinear, i.e.\nd2\nf (um,n ) 6= 0.\ndu2mn\n\n(165)\n\nB(ymn , zmn ) = B = const .\n\n(166)\n\nThen we must have\nThe equation to be solved for f (u) is actually eq. (163) which simplifies to\n(Au + B)f \u2032 (u) = (A \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)f (u).\n\n(167)\n\nFor A 6= 0 the solution of eq.

The PDE (155) in this case is conformally invariant. This infinite\ndimensional symmetry algebra is not present for the discrete case considered in\nthis section.\n\n28\n\n\f\u2710\n\n\u2710\nun\u22121\n\n\u2710\n\u2710\nu\nun\nn+1\n\n\u2710\n\nFigure 3: A monoatomic chain\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSymmetries of Discrete Dynamical Systems\nGeneral Formalism\n\nIn this chapter we shall discuss differential-difference equations on a fixed onedimensional lattice. Thus, time t will be a continuous variable, n \u2208 Z a discrete one. We will be modeling discrete monoatomic or diatomic molecular\nchains with equally spaced rest positions. The individual atoms will be vibrating around their rest positions. For monoatomic chains the actual position of\nthe n-th atom is described by one continuous variable un (t). For diatomic atoms\nthere will be two such functions, un (t) and vn (t).\nOnly nearest neighbour interaction will be considered. The interaction are\ndescribed by a priori unspecified functions. Our aim is to classify these functions\naccording to their symmetries.\nThree different models have been studied [42, 23, 34]. They correspond to\nFig. 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\nThe model illustrated on Fig. 3 corresponds to the equation [42]\n\u0001\n(173)\n\u00fcn (t) \u2212 Fn t, un\u22121 (t), un (t), un+1 (t) = 0.\nFig. 4 could correspond to a very primitive model of the DNA molecule. The\nequations are [23]\n\u0001\n\u00fcn = Fn t, un\u22121 (t), un (t), un+1 (t), vn\u22121 (t), vn (t), vn+1 (t) = 0\n\u0001\nv\u0308n = Gn t, un\u22121 (t), un (t), un+1 (t), vn\u22121 (t), vn (t), vn+1 (t) = 0.

(179) involves a prolongation to t-derivatives u\u0307n and\n\u00fcn , and to all values of n figuring in eq.

To do this we introduce a group of\n\"allowed transformations\", or a \"classifying group\". We define this to be a\ngroup of fiber preserving point transformations\nun (t) = \u03a9n (\u0169n (t\u0303), t\u0303, g),\n\nt\u0303 = t\u0303(t, g),\n\n\u00f1 = n,\n\n(185)\n\ntaking eq.

(188) and (189) \u03c4 (t), an , \u03b2n and Fn are given, whereas t\u0303(t), An and Bn (t)\nb\nare ours to choose. We use these quantities to simplify the vector field X.\nOur classification strategy is the following one. We first classify one-dimensional subalgebras. Thus, we have one vector field of the form (184). If \u03c4 (t)\nsatisfies \u03c4 (t) 6= 0 in some open interval, we use t\u0303(t) to normalize \u03c4 (t) = 1 and\nBn (t) to transform \u03b2n (t) into \u03b2n (t) = 0. If we have \u03c4 (t) = 0, an 6= 0, we use\nBn (t) to annul \u03b2n (t). The last possibility is \u03c4 (t) = 0, an = 0, \u03b2n (t) 6= 0. Then\nwe cannot simplify further. The same transformations will also simplify the\ndetermining equation (183) and we can, in each case, solve it for the interaction\nFn (t, un\u22121 , un , un+1 ).\nOnce all interactions allowing one dimensional symmetry algebras are determined, we proceed further structurally. We first find all Abelian symmetry groups and the corresponding interactions allowing them. We run through\nour list of one-dimensional algebras and take them in an already establlished\n\"canonical\" form. Let us call this element X1 (in each case). We then find all\nelements X of the form (184) that satisfy [X1 , X] = 0. We classify the obtained\noperators X under the action of a subgroup of the group of allowed transformations, namely the isotropy group of X1 (the group that leaves the subalgebra\nX1 invariant). For each Abelian group we find the invariant interaction.\n\u00bfFrom Abelian symmetry algebras we proceed to nilpotent ones, then to\nsolvable ones and finally to nonsolvable ones. These can be semisimple, or they\nmay have a nontrivial Levi decomposition.\nAll details can be found in the original article [42], here we shall present the\nmain results.\n\n4.2\n\nOne-Dimensional Symmetry Algebras\n\nThree classes of one-dimensional symmetry algebras exist. Together with their\ninvariant interactions, they can be represented by\nA1,1\n\nX = \u2202t + an un \u2202un\nFn (t, uk ) = fn (\u03ben\u22121 , \u03ben , \u03ben+1 )ean t\n\u03bek = uk e\n\nA1,2\n\n\u2212ak t\n\n,\n\nk = n \u2212 1, n, n + 1.\n\nX = an un \u2202un\nFn (t, uk ) = un fn (t, \u03ben\u22121 , \u03ben+1 )\n\u03ben\u00b11 =\n\nn\nuan\u00b11\nunan\u00b11 .\n\n32\n\n(190)\n\n(191)\n\n\fA1,3\n\nX = \u03b2n (t)\u2202un\n\u03b2\u0308n\nun + fn (t, \u03ben\u22121 , \u03ben+1 )\n\u03b2n\n= \u03b2n (t)un\u00b11 \u2212 \u03b2n\u00b11 (t)un .\n\nFn (t, uk ) =\n\u03ben\u00b11\n\n(192)\n\nWe see that the existence of a one-dimensional Lie algebra implies that the\ninteraction F is an arbitrary function of three variables, rather than the original\nfour. The actual form of the interaction in eq. (190), (191) and (192) was\nobtained by solving eq. (183), once the canonical form of vector field X in\neq. (190), (191), or (192) was taken into account.\n\n4.3\n\nAbelian Lie Algebras of Dimension N \u2265 2\n\nWithout proof we state several theorems.\n\nTheorem 1. An Abelian symmetry algebra of eq.

Consider\na Lie algebra L \u223c {X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn }, where the elements Xi form a basis. To\neach algebra L one associates two series of subalgebras.\n34\n\n\fThe derived series consist of the algebras\nL0 \u2261 L,\n\nL1 \u2261 DL = [L, L],\nL\n\nN\n\nL2 \u2261 D2 L = [DL, DL], . . .\n\n\u2261 DN L = [DN \u22121 L, DN \u22121 L].\n\n(202)\n\nThe algebra of commutators DL is called the derived algebra. If we have DL =\nL, the algebra L is called perfect. If an integer N exists for which we have\nDN L = {0}, the algebra L is called solvable.\nThe central series consist of the algebras\nL0 \u2261 L,\n\nL1 = L1 = [L, L],\n\nL2 = [L, L1 ], . . . LN = [L, LN \u22121 ], . . .\n\n(203)\n\nIf there exists an integer N for which we have LN = {0}, the algebra L is\ncalled nilpotent. Clearly, every nilpotent algebra is solvable, but the converse is\nnot true.\nLet us consider two examples\n1. The Lie algebra of the Euclidean group of a plane: e(2) \u223c {L3 , P1 , P2 }.\nThe commmutation relations are\n[L3 , P1 ] = P2 ,\n\n[L3 , P2 ] = \u2212P1 ,\n\n[P1 , P2 ] = 0.\n\n(204)\n\nThe derived series is\nL = {L3 , P1 , P2 } \u2283 DL = {P1 , P2 },\n\nD2 L = {0}\n\nand the central series is\nL \u2283 L1 = {P1 , P2 } = L2 = L3 = . . .\nHence e(2) is solvable but not nilpotent.\n2. The Heisenberg algebra H1 \u223c {X1 , X2 , X3 } where the basis can be reallized e.g. by the derivative operator, the coordinate x and the identity\n1:\nX1 = \u2202x , X2 = x, X3 = 1.\nWe have\n[X1 , X2 ] = X3 ,\n\n[X1 , X3 ] = [X2 , X3 ] = 0\n\n(205)\n\nand hence\nDL\nL1\n\n= {X3 },\n= {X3 },\n\nD2 L = 0.\nL2 = 0.\n\nWe see that the Heisenberg algebra is nilpotent (and solvable).\nAn Abelian Lie algebra is of course also nilpotent.\nWe shall need some results concerning nilpotent Lie algebras (by nilpotent\nwe mean nilpotent non-Abelian).\n35\n\n\f1. Nilpotent Lie algebras always contain Abelian ideals.\n2. All nilpotent Lie algebras contain the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra as a subalgebra.\nWe shall also use some basic properties of solvable Lie algebras, where by\nsolvable we mean solvable, non-nilpotent.\n1. Every solvable Lie algebra L contains a unique maximal nilpotent ideal\ncalled the nilradical N R(L). The dimension of the nilradical satisfies\n1\ndim(L) \u2264 dim N R(L) \u2264 dim(L) \u2212 1.\n2\n\n(206)\n\n2.

A simple Lie algebra L has no nontrivial\nideals, i.e.\nI \u2286 L, [I, I] \u2286 I, [L, I] \u2286 I\n(208)\nimplies I \u223c {0}, or I = L.\nA semisimple Lie algebra L is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras Li\nL \u223c L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Lp ,\n\n[Li , Lk ] = 0.\n\n(209)\n\nIf L is not simple, semisimple, or solvable, then it allows a unique Levi decomposition into a semidirect sum\nL\u223cS+\n\u2283 R,\n\n[S, S] = S,\n\n[R, R] \u2282 R,\n\n[S, R] \u2286 R\n\n(210)\n\nwhere S is semisimple and R is solvable; R is called the radical of L, i.e. the\nmaximal solvable ideal.\nLet us now return to the symmetry classification of discrete dynamical systems.\n\n4.5\n\nNilpotent Non-Abelian Symmetry Algebras\n\nSince every nilpotent Lie algebra contains the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra, we start by constructing this algebra, H1 \u223c {X1 , X2 , X3 }.

The only simple\nalgebra that can be constructed out of vector fields of the form (184) is sl(2, R).\nThe algebra and the corresponding invariant interaction can be represented as:\n1\nX2 = t\u2202t + un \u2202un\n2\nX3 = t2 \u2202t + tun \u2202un\nuk\n1\n.\nFn = 3 fn (\u03ben\u22121 , \u03ben+1 ), \u03bek =\nun\nun\n\nN S3,1 :\n\nX1 = \u2202t ,\n\n(224)\n\nThis algebra can be further extended to a four, five or seven-dimensional symmetry algebra.

(226), (220), (221) and (222),\nrespectively.\nA natural question to ask is: Where is the Toda lattice in this classification?\nThe Toda lattice is described by the equation\nun,tt = eun\u22121 \u2212un \u2212 eun \u2212un+1 .\n\n(229)\n\nThis equation is of the form (173). It is integrable [57] and has many interesting\nproperties. In our classification it appears as a special case of the algebra SN4,4 ,\ni.e.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nun+1 \u2212 un\n\u00fcn = exp \u22122\nfn (\u03be),\n(230)\n\u03b3n+1 \u2212 \u03b3n\n\nwith\n\nfn (\u03be) = \u22121 + e\u03be/2 ,\n\n\u03b3n = 2n.\n\n(231)\n\nThus, its symmetry group is four-dimensional. We see that the Toda lattice is\nnot particularly distinguished by its point symmetries: other interactions have\nlarger symmetry groups. Even in the SN4,4 class two functions have to be\nspecialized (see eq. (231) to reduce (230) to (229).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nGeneralized Point Symmetries of Linear and\nLinearizable Systems\nUmbral Calculus\n\nIn this chapter we take a different point of view than in the previous ones. Instead of purely point symmetries, we shall consider a specific class of generalized\nsymmetries of difference equations that we shall call \"generalised point symmetries\". They act simultaneously at several, or even infinitely many points of a\nlattice, but they reduce to point symmetries of a differential equation in the\ncontinuous limit.\nThe approach that we shall discuss here is at this stage applicable either to\nlinear difference equations, or to nonlinear equations that can be linearized by\na transformation of variables (not necessarily only point transformations).\nThe mathematical basis for this type of study is the so called \"umbral calculus\" reviewed in recent books and articles by G.G. Rota and his collaborators [55,54,10]. Umbral calculus provides a unified basis for studying symmetries\nof linear differential and difference equations.\nFirst of all, let us introduce several fundamental concepts.\nDefinition 1. A shift operator T\u03b4 is a linear operator acting on polynomials or\nformal power series in the following manner\nT\u03b4 f (x) = f (x + \u03b4),\n\n40\n\nx \u2208 R,\n\n\u03b4 \u2208 R.\n\n(232)\n\n\fFor functions of several variables we introduce shift operators in the same\nmanner\nT\u03b4i f (x1 , . . . xi\u22121 , xi , xi+1 . . . xn )\n= f (x1 , . . . , xi\u22121 , xi + \u03b4i , xi+1 , . . . , xn ).\n\n(233)\n\nIn this section we restrict the exposition to the case of one real variable\nx \u2208 R. The extension to n variables and other fields is obvious.\nDefinition 2. An operator U is called a \"delta operator\" if it satisfies the\nfollowing properties\n1) It is shift invariant;\nT\u03b4 U = U T\u03b4 ,\n\n\u2200\u03b4 \u2208 R\n\n(234)\n\nc = const\n\n(235)\n\n2)\nU x = c 6= 0,\n3)\nU a = 0,\n\n\u2200a\n\n(236)\n\nand the kernal of U consists precisely of all constant.\nImportant properties of delta operator are:\n1. For every delta operator U there exists a unique series of basic polynomials\n{pn (x)} satisfying\np0 (x) = 1\n\npn (0) = 0,\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\nU pn (x) = npn\u22121 (x).\n\n(237)\n\n2. For every umbral operator U there exists a conjugate operator \u03b2, such\nthat\n[U, x\u03b2] = 1.\n(238)\nThe operator \u03b2 satisfies\n\u2032\n\n\u03b2 = (U )\u22121 ,\n\n\u2032\n\nU = [U, x].\n\n(239)\n\nThe expression\n\u2032\n\nU \u2261 U \u2217 x \u2261 [U, x]\n\n(240)\n\nis called the \"Pincherle derivative\" of U [55, 54, 10].\nFor us the fundamental fact is that the pair of operators, U and x\u03b2, satisfies\nthe Heisenberg relation (238).\nBefore going further, let us give the two simplest possible examples.\nExample 6. The (continuous) derivative\nP0 = 1,\n\nU = \u2202x , \u03b2 = 1\nP1 = x, . . . , Pn = xn , . . .\n41\n\n(241)\n\n\fExample 7.

This correspondence will also take the set of basic\npolynomials related to {U, \u03b2} into the set related to the pair {\u0169, \u03b2\u0303}.\nWe shall use two types of delta operators. The first is simply the derivative\nU = \u2202x , for which we have \u03b2 = 1. The second is a general difference operator\nU = \u2206 that has \u2202x is its continuous limit.

Example: time translations.\nu\u03bb = ut = 0.\n52\n\n(317)\n\n\fThen u = u(x) and\nuxx + 2uux = 0 \u21d2 ux + u2 = K.\n\n(318)\n\n\u00bfFrom here, we obtain three types of solutions\nu=\n\n1\n,\nx\n\nu = k arctanh kx,\n\nu = k arctan kx.\n\n(319)\n\nSymmetry reduction in the discrete case. All flows have the form (309). The\ncondition u\u03bb = 0 hence implies\nS\u03c6 = K(t)\u03c6,\n\n(320)\n\nwhere K(t) is an arbitrary function. This equation must be solved together\nwith the discrete Burgers equation in order to obtain group invariant solutions.\nLet us here consider just one example, namely that of time translations, the\nfirst equation in (315). Eq. (320) reduces to\n\u2206t \u03c6 = K(t)\u03c6,\n\n(321)\n\nv = \u2206x u + uTx u = K(t).\n\n(322)\n\ni.e.\nWe rewrite the Burgers equation as\n\u2206t u =\n\n1 + \u03b4x u\n\u2206x v\n1 + \u03b4t v\n\nv \u2261 \u2206x u + uTx u.\n\n(323)\n\nHowever, from (322) we have v = K(t) and hence \u2206t u = 0, K(t) = Ko = const.\nSince \u03c6 satisfies the heat equation, we can rewrite (321) as\n\u2206xx \u03c6 = Ko \u03c6.\n\n(324)\n\nThe general solution of (324) is obtained for Ko 6= 0 by putting \u03c6 = ax and\nsolving (324) for a. We find\np\np\n\u03c6 = c1 (1 + K0 \u03b4x )x/\u03b4x + c2 (1 \u2212 K0 \u03b4x )x/\u03b4x .\n(325)\n\nFor Ko = 0 we have\n\n\u03c6 = c1 + c2 x.\n\n(326)\n\nSolutions of the discrete Burgers equation are obtained via the Cole-Hopf transformation\n\u2206x \u03c6\n.\n(327)\nu=\n\u03c6\nThe same procedure can be followed for all other symmetries. We obtain linear\nsecond order difference equations for \u03c6 involving one variable only. However,\nthe equations have variable coefficients and are hard to solve. They can be reexpressed as equations for u(x, t), again involving only one independent variable.\n53\n\n\fThus, a reduction takes place, but it is not easy to solve the reduced equations\nexplicitly.\nFor instance, Galilei invariant solutions of the discrete Burgers equation must\nsatisfy the ordinary difference equation\n\u0012\n2tTx u + x \u2212 K(t) + 2t\u03b4x uTx u + \u03b4t 27 Tx u + 27 \u03b4x uTx u\n\u0013\n(328)\n3\n+xuTx u + x\u2206x u \u2212 2 u + 23 \u03b4x \u2212 K(t)[\u03b4x u + \u03b4t (Tx \u2206x u\n+uTx2u \u2212 uTx u) + Tx uTx2 u + \u03b4x uTx uTx2 u] = 0\n\nwhere t figures as a parameter.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI thank the organizers of the CIMPA School for giving me the opportunity to\npresent these lectures.
