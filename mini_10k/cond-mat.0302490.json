Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS),\nNano Electro-Mechanical Systems (NEMS), or hard disk drives require an accurate control\nof friction, wear, and adhesion at the nanometer scale [1, 2, 3]. From a fundamental point of\nview the investigation of the influence of the chemico-physical condition of the surface at the\nnanoscale on the tribological behavior can provide important elements for the understanding\nof friction, wear, and lubrication phenomena.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is one of the most powerful techniques for the investigation of tribology and in particular of nano-friction [4, 5, 6]. An atomic force microscope\ncan simultaneously acquire topographic maps of surfaces with nanometric resolution, and\nfriction maps operating in the so-called Friction-Force mode. Friction Force Microscopy\n(FFM) is possible thanks to the simultaneous acquisition of the vertical deflections of the\nbeam supporting the AFM tip, related to changes in the topographic relief, and the lateral\ndeflections, proportional to the friction force between the tip and the sample surface [2, 7].\nIn order to perform quantitative friction measurements it is necessary to control and measure accurately the forces acting on the AFM tip. Parameters such as roughness, granularity,\npower spectrum of the surface play an important role. The effects of surface topography\non nano-friction measurements have been studied, although a general theory is still lacking [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In many cases, attention has been concentrated on flat crystalline\nsurfaces under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV), where the influence of surface topography is negligible [13, 14, 15, 16].\nOn the other hand, real surfaces in every-day conditions necessitate to take into account\nthe topographic contribution to lateral force maps in order to achieve quantitative tribological information. Actually, in the case of corrugated samples, that is of locally tilted surfaces,\nthe measured forces in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the AFM reference plane\ndo not necessarily coincide with the forces acting parallel and perpendicularly to the sample\nsurface, which actually define the friction coefficient and the friction vs. load characteristics of the interface under investigation [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. These effects related to surface\nmorphology depend on the ratio between the dimension of the sliding probe and that of the\nsurface asperities. In this sense friction is a scale-dependent phenomenon, and a tool such\n2\n\n\fthe AFM, which is able to provide morphological information on a wide range of scales, is\nvery attractive for such studies.\nIn this paper we consider the role of the topographic correction in a general way and\ninquiry whether it is possible to follow a model-independent approach, providing the friction\nvs. load characteristics of the system under investigation without the need of postulating\nany particular contact-friction model. We discuss the experimental limitations, which make\nthe model-independent approach unreliable and we solve the problem of the topographic\ncorrection in the particular case of the adhesive multi-asperity contact, which is of common\noccurrence in many experimental setups. To this purpose, we introduce a modified version\nof the Amonton's law for friction [17] (linear dependence of friction on the load), which\nshould better apply to the case of low loads and few asperities in contact. We present our\ntopographic correction procedure in the framework of a complete quantitative statistical\nprotocol based on the AFM for the characterization of frictional properties of materials at\nsub-micron scale. We discuss the limit of validity of this model and highlight the underlying\nassumptions.\nThe article is organized as follows: in sections II and III we present the theory of the\ntopographic correction of lateral force maps acquired with a standard beam deflection AFM;\nin section IV we discuss the multi-asperity adhesive contact regime typical of FFM experiments and present a friction model which should apply to FFM experiments in the presence\nof humidity; in section V we include this model in the topographic correction theory and\nderive the basic equations for interpreting the experimental data; in section VI we describe\nthe experimental setup and the characterization protocol; in section VII we discuss the\nvalidity of the topographic correction protocol via its application to a corrugated Polytetrafluoroethylene surface. Conclusions are reported in section VIII.\n\nII.\n\nFFM ON CORRUGATED SAMPLES: THE TOPOGRAPHIC CORRECTION\n\nIn a typical FFM experiment the cantilever is scanned across the surface in a direction\northogonal to the long cantilever axis. Using a segmented photodiode, with two upper and\ntwo bottom quadrants, it is possible to measure accurately not only the vertical cantilever\ndisplacements, but also the cantilever lateral torsion. The vertical deflection of the cantilever\nis proportional to the applied load, while fluctuations around the average position are due\n3\n\n\fto corrugations of the sample surface [2]. These vertical fluctuations represent the input of a\nfeedback loop, keeping the cantilever deflection, that is the applied load, constant. Recording\nthe relative displacements of the tip-sample assembly provides the AFM topographic map.\nThe torsion of the cantilever is in turn proportional to the friction force between the AFM\ntip and the sample surface. The acquisition of lateral cantilever deflections (the so-called\nlateral force signals) provides the friction map. Both topographic and friction maps can be\nrecorded simultaneously. Fig. 1 shows a typical friction loop, i.e. the lateral force signals\nT R and RET R (in arbitrary units) acquired in the two opposite directions during a single\nscan (these directions are usually called Trace and Retrace). The typical loop shape is due\nto the fact that the lateral signal changes sign when the motion of the tip is reversed. The\nramps at the beginning of the Trace and Retrace curves are due to a pivot effect during the\nreversal of the tip motion.\nIn order to achieve a quantitative understanding of the friction properties of a surface\none needs to consider closely the contact regime occurring during the experiment. Contact\nregimes in FFM and standard macroscopic friction tests can be very different [18, 19]. In\ntypical FFM measurements, the radius of curvature of the AFM tip can be comparable or\neven smaller to the size of morphological surface features (few nanometers). If \u03be is a measure\nof the average extension of morphological features of the surface (the correlation length of\nthe surface can be used [20]) and R is the AFM tip radius, the aforementioned situation\nis characterized by the condition \u03be/R \u2265 1 (Fig. 2, right). In this case a single-asperity\ncontact is to be expected [21]. The limiting case is represented by a sharp spherical or\nparabolic tip (as those prepared via electron beam deposition techniques [22]) sliding on an\natomically smooth surface (a situation which can be well realized in UHV-FFM apparatus).\nIn macroscopic friction experiments a slider, typically a ball or a disk, is scanned across\na surface with a geometric or apparent contact area as large as few cm2 [19]. As long as\nthe dimension of the slider is large compared to \u03be (\u03be/R \u2264 1, Fig. 2, left), a multi-asperity\ncontact is to be expected [21].\nThe friction coefficient \u03bc is defined as the ratio f /N, where f is the opposing friction\nforce acting on the slider in the direction perpendicular to the local surface normal and N is\nthe load applied along the surface normal. The presence of a global tilt of the surface, that\nis a tilt on a scale comparable or larger than that of the probe, can affect the measurement\nof the friction coefficient. This is because in typical friction apparatus the forces tangential\n4\n\n\fand perpendicular to the ideally flat laboratory reference plane are measured, say T and\nL. If the surface is tilted, T and L are no longer parallel to f and N, accordingly. A\ntopographic correction to the measured quantities T and L is thus necessary in order to get\nthe values of f and N and from these the value of the friction coefficient [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\nIn many experimental situations, typically in macroscopic friction tests, the sample surface\nis supposed to be flat on a length scale large compared to the slider dimension. In this case\nthe measured forces corresponds to the local normal and tangential components, and the\nabove definition of the friction coefficient readily applies. In FFM experiments on corrugated\nsurfaces however the probe is likely to be scanned on a locally tilted surface, as shown in\nFig. 2. The topographic correction is thus an essential part of any protocol devoted to the\nquantitative characterization of frictional properties of surfaces.\nA good parameter characterizing the flatness of the sample surface is the local slope\ntan(\u03b8)R . The pedex R means that the slope is calculated with resolution equal to the slider\ndimension. For the surface to be considered locally tilted, it is necessary that the tilt extends\non a length bigger than the slider dimension (i.e. tan(\u03b8)R 6= 0), as shown in Fig. 2, where\nthe local tilt of the surface, \u03b8\u2217 , is calculated with resolution equal to the radius of the bigger\nprobe. The map of local slopes is readily obtained from the topographic map. Because of\nthe possibility of acquiring simultaneously the topographic and the lateral force maps, FFM\nis the technique of choice to perform accurate friction measurements at those small scales\nwhere the topographic correction is required.\nIn order to consider the topographic correction, we show in Fig. 3 the forces acting on\nthe AFM tip sliding over a sloped surface. The negative sign indicates the retrace direction.\nNotice that \u03b8 \u2261 \u03b8R is the local surface tilt. The tip is forced against the object by two forces\nexerted by the cantilever: one is the applied load L[43], directed downward, the other is the\ntangential force T originating in the torsion of the cantilever, in the direction of motion.\nThree other forces act on the tip: the friction force f, perpendicular to the local normal and\nalways opposing the motion, the local surface adhesion A, directed as the local normal, and\na normal reaction \u03a6, equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the total applied load\nN. It should be noticed that while the applied load L, the adhesion force A and the surface\nreaction \u03a6 have always the same direction, the tangential and friction forces T and f invert\ntheir direction as the motion is reversed, from Trace to Retrace.\nProjecting the equilibrium condition T + f + L + \u03a6 + A = 0 for Trace (+) and Retrace\n5\n\n\f(-) along the local normal and tangential axes provides a system of four equations, which\nrepresents the topographic correction, providing f and N as a function of T , L, A and \u03b8:\nf+ = T+ cos(\u03b8) \u2212 L sin(\u03b8)\nN+ = L cos(\u03b8) + T+ sin(\u03b8) + A\nf\u2212 = T\u2212 cos(\u03b8) + L sin(\u03b8)\nN\u2212 = L cos(\u03b8) \u2212 T\u2212 sin(\u03b8) + A\n\n(1)\n\nGiven a number of (f, N) pairs, the model-independent friction vs. load curve of the interface\nconsidered is obtained. Depending on the mechanics of the contact (single or multi-asperity),\nboth a power law and a linear behavior can be observed [21]. Interesting physical parameters\nsuch as the friction coefficient, the surface energy, the true contact area etc. can in principle\nbe extracted fitting the experimental f vs. N curve.\nIn the above equations T is the force acting parallel to the AFM reference plane. In fact,\nwhat is measured are the true lateral force signals, T\u00b1 , plus an instrumental offset Tinstr\n(T R and RET R, which form the friction loop shown in Fig. 1). Assuming the instrumental\noffset to be independent on the direction of motion, we have:\nT R = T+ + Tinstr\nRET R = \u2212T\u2212 + Tinstr\n\n(2)\n\nWe can now reconsider more closely the friction loop in Fig. 1 in order to express the\nequations of the topographic correction in terms of measurable quantities. A vertical offset\n\u2206 is present in the friction loop, causing the loop having a non-zero average. The offset \u2206\nof the friction loop is calculated as:\n\u2206 = 1/2 * (T R + RET R)\n\n(3)\n\nAlso indicated in Fig. 1 is the average half width of the loop, W :\nW = 1/2 * (T R \u2212 RET R)\n\n(4)\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 2 into Eqs. 3 and 4 we obtain:\nT+ + T\u2212\n2\nT+ \u2212 T\u2212\n\u2206 = Tinstr +\n2\n\nW =\n\n6\n\n(5)\n\n\fWe see from Eqs. 5 that even if we were able to subtract point-by-point the instrumental\noffset from the friction loop, still the loop average would be non-zero, but equal to (T+ +\nT\u2212 )/2. This residual offset is intrinsically due to the presence of a local non-zero slope,\ncausing the local effective load N, and consequently the local friction f , and the lateral\nsignals T+ and T\u2212 to be different in Trace and Retrace (see Eqs. 1). Moreover, it turns\nout that W is an approximation of both the Trace and Retrace lateral force signals T+ and\nT\u2212 , i.e. an average lateral force. While the instrumental offset cancels out in Eq. 4 after\nthe subtraction[44], there are spurious contributions to lateral force which do not cancel,\nhaving the same sign (but generally different magnitudes) in Trace and Retrace. These\ncontributions are due to the ploughing and collision mechanisms reported for instance in\nRef. 12. These spurious contributions are related to sudden changes in surface slope, but\nthey can not be accounted for as we did for the other topographic contributions discussed\nabove in that there is not any analytic relation to parameters such as slope, applied load\nand scanning velocity. However, provided the scanning velocity is not very high and the\nfeedback loop of the AFM is properly adjusted, these spurious contributions to lateral force\nmaps can be smoothed out if a large number of points in the map are acquired, in that they\nrepresent only a small fraction of the lateral force map.\nFinally from Eqs. 5 we obtain:\nT+ = W + \u2206 \u2212 Tinstr\nT\u2212 = W \u2212 \u2206 + Tinstr\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 6 into Eqs. 1, the model-independent friction characteristics f vs. N in\nterms of the measurable quantities W and D and the instrumental offset Tinstr is obtained.\nIn the following section we will discuss the properties of the instrumental offset and highlight\nthe reasons why its measurement is not usually reliable.\n\nIII.\n\nINSTRUMENTAL OFFSET\n\nThe instrumental offset Tinstr is determined by thermal drifts of the cantilever, electronic\nnoise, laser intensity fluctuations and laser interference, changes in the environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity) and cross-talking effects, causing a spurious lateral\nsignal even in the absence of any true lateral force. The instrumental offset can vary from\n7\n\n\fscan to scan, and also during the same scan, and it is in general load-dependent. Crosstalking represents the most important contribution to the instrumental offset [23, 24]. It\nis caused by a bad alignment of the laser beam with respect to the photodiode array. If\nthe plane containing the beam is not perpendicular to the plane of the photodiodes, vertical\ndisplacements of the cantilever will cause a spurious lateral signal, even in the absence of any\napplied load and/or friction force. The alignment of the laser with respect to the cantilever\nand photodetector is thus a critical step in any FFM experiments. Some authors report\nabout correction of the cross-talking effect via electronic compensation [24], however this\nimply the risk of manipulating the true signal and it is in general not simple to perform,\nin that it requires an accurate measurement of the spurious lateral force signal versus the\napplied load.\nOne way to characterize the instrumental offset is to record the lateral force signals\nduring approaching-retracting cycles of the tip on the sample. Because the cantilever does\nnot move laterally during approaching-retracting cycles, any lateral deflection measured by\nthe photodiodes can be attributed to cross-talking effects. The force vs. distance curve and\nthe lateral force curve are in one-by-one correspondence: the first provide the applied loads,\nwhile the second provides the spurious lateral force offset corresponding to each applied\nload. In Fig. 4 the Tinstr vs. applied load curve acquired with the method described above is\nshown. The signals acquired in the approaching and retracting part of the cycle are different.\nMoreover, the spurious lateral force is not negligible, compared with typical frictional forces\nin FFM experiment (few nN). The presence of strong laser interference is visible.\nIt is definitely clear in Fig. 4 that the instrumental offset does depend in general on the\napplied load. This method is useful to qualitatively characterize the instrumental offset and\nits load dependence. However, it is not reliable. Even if one takes the average over many\napproaching-retracting cycles, the offset changes quickly, and the curve acquired before the\nFFM measurement is usually different from the one acquired after. Moreover, the bending\nand twisting of the cantilever during the approaching-retracting cycles does not mimic necessarily those occuring during the Trace and Retrace scans for any given applied load, if\nnot qualitatively. In principle, a more reliable method to characterize quantitatively the instrumental offset could be to measure the spurious lateral deflections during free oscillations\nof the cantilever, at different oscillation amplitudes, which would correspond to different\napplied loads in contact mode. The drawbacks of this method, not implemented here, are\n8\n\n\fthat only relatively small amplitudes can be set (i.e. low loads), and that the tip is not in\ncontact with the sample, that is, there could be contact-induced contributions to the offset,\nwhich are not taken into account when measuring the free oscillations of the cantilevers.\nThe topographic correction (Eqs. 1 and Eqs. 6) based on the direct measurement of the\ninstrumental offset is hampered by the difficulty in measuring reliably and accurately this\nessential parameter. A possible way to circumvent this problem is to fix, a priori, the friction\nregime (in fact, only the multi-asperity case can be worked out analytically, because of the\nsimple linear dependence of friction on load). Apart from difficulties in the calculations, even\nfor the simplest models, it must be pointed out that this strategy is not fully satisfactory,\nbecause it assumes the friction regime, while it would be better to infer it from experimental\ndata. However, the validity of the model adopted can be confirmed, a posteriori, from the\nshape of the lateral force vs. load curves, and the choice of the model can be supported by\nreasonable assumptions about the material to be investigated and the size and shape of the\nAFM tip.\n\nIV.\n\nADHESION AND THE MODIFIED AMONTON'S LAW\n\nIn this section we address the problem of the adhesive contact between two surfaces, in\norder to define and possibly justify a reasonable friction model to be used in the equations\nof the topographic correction developed in the previous paragraphs.\nA fundamental relation is the proportionality between the friction force f and the contact\narea a between two bodies [17]:\nf = \u03c4a\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c4 being the shear modulus, i.e. the friction force per unit area. Eq. 7 has been verified experimentally both directly (with the Surface Force Apparatus [25] or friction-current\nmeasurements [26]) for single-asperity contacts and indirectly, through the validity of the\ncontact mechanics models [15]. The shear modulus \u03c4 depends in general on the number and\nnature of bonds forming at the interface, while the contact area depends on the mechanical\nproperties of the interface, that is on the bulk properties of tip and sample materials.\nContact mechanics aims to provide for every contact regime the functional relation a(N)\nbetween the contact area a and the load N. Once the relation a(N) is established, the\nfriction vs. load characteristics f (N) for a particular system is given by Eq. 7. Classical\n9\n\n\fcontact mechanics for continuous elastic bodies was proved to be applicable to nanometersized contacts, as the ones occurring in FFM [13, 22, 26, 27].\nFFM offers a wide spectrum of contact regimes, depending on both interface properties (tip radius, surface corrugation, as well as elastic properties of tip and sample), and\nenvironmental properties, such as relative humidity. The load range is also important in\ndetermining the contact regime. During FFM experiments on flat surfaces using well characterized spherical or parabolic tips a single-asperity contact is likely to take place [22].\nWhen corrugated samples are investigated in ambient conditions, in the presence of humidity and contaminants, a multi-asperity contact is even possible, altough the smoothing\neffect of contaminants of tip and sample nano-corrugations, leading to a transition from a\nmulti- to a single-asperity contact, has also been observed [28]. The AFM allows indeed\nto investigate different contact regimes, provided a good characterization of the tip and\nsample morphology is given and the possibility of imaging under controlled environmental\nconditions.\nIn the case of non-adhering elastic and plastic multi-asperity contact, a linear dependence\nof friction on load L is expected, the so-called Amonton's law [17]:\nf = \u03bcL\n\n(8)\n\nGiven a load in the range [0-100] nN and a typical contact area from a few tens to a few\nthousands of nm2 , a pressure in the MPa-GPa range is applied to the sample. This range\nis comparable to those of macroscopic friction tests, where loads are in the Newton range\nand contact areas can be up to few cm2 [19]. However, in FFM, load can be comparable to\nadhesive forces (up to hundreds of nN). This implies that adhesion plays a fundamental role\nin every FFM experiment in ambient condition, and it is expected to strongly influence the\nfriction behavior.\nA considerable effort has been made in order to include adhesion in the models of multiasperity elastic contact [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. A definite model of roughness-dependent adhesion\nis still lacking. The available studies on adhesive multi-asperity contacts do not provide the\nrelation between the area of contact and the load, which would provide in turn the actual\nfriction law through Eq. 7 in the case of multi-asperity adhesive contacts. If adhesion is\nconsidered explicitly in Amonton's equations, setting N = L + A, where L is the external\n\n10\n\n\fapplied load and A is the adhesion force, Eq. 8 becomes:\nf = \u03bcN = \u03bc(L + A) \u223c\n= const + \u03bcL\n\n(9)\n\nThis form of the Amonton's law is also known as the Coulomb equation [17]. At zero external\napplied load (L = 0), Eq. 9 predicts a non-zero friction force, as in the case of both the\nJohnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) [34] and Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) [35] models for\nthe single-asperity adhesive contact. Unless the JKR model, however, the Coulomb law\ndoes not account for any finite frictional force in the limit of zero-total applied load, i.e. at\npull-off. Another limitation of the Coulomb law is that adhesion A is considered constant,\nwhile it is reasonable that it varies with load, expecially in the typical FFM conditions.\nThe contact mechanics of an FFM represents an intermediate case between the macroscopic multi-asperity case and the UHV single-asperity case, in that the contacting asperities,\nespecially in the low-load regime, can be really a few. The SPM case lies in the low load,\nfew asperities range where the asymptotic predictions of the different existing models fail.\nThis point makes the study of the multi-asperity adhesive regime in FFM experiments very\ndifficult. Without a complete contact theory, one may try to use reasonable models justifying them a posteriori with the experimental observations and theoretical results in the\nsingle-asperity limit. A possibility is to generalize Eq. 9 including an offset c in the linear\ndependence:\nf \u2217 \u2243 \u03bcN + c\n\n(10)\n\nThe linear dependence on load accounts for the fact that the contact is not single-asperity\n-like, especially when the AFM is operated on corrugated samples in humid air. The offset c\naccounts for the zero-total load friction force typical of many single-asperity contact, a limit\nnot too far from the actual experimental situation. Moreover, as pointed out by Schwarz et\nal., an offset in the Amonton's law accounts also for the uncertainty in the determination\nof the pull-off force [14, 36]. Whether the adhesive offset is due to uncertainty in the\nmeasurements of adhesion or is intrinsic, this can be proved a posteriori on the basis of its\nnumerical value (see discussion below). Eq. 10 can be thought as the low-load limit of a\nmore complex a \u2261 a(N) dependence. The choice of a modified Amonton's law represents an\nattempt to generalize the Coulomb law in order to interprete friction data acquired with the\nFFM in common experimental situations, where a multi-asperity adhesive contact is likely\nto occur, but with only a few asperities in the low load regime.\n11\n\n\fV.\n\nTHE TOPOGRAPHIC CORRECTION FOR THE MODIFIED AMONTON'S\n\nLAW\n\nWe will consider Eq. 10 in the general framework of the topographic correction developed\nin Section II. We remind that in Eq. 10 N represents the total applied load in the direction\nperpendicular to the surface, including the contribution of adhesion A. Substituting Eq. 10\nin Eqs. 1 we obtain a new set of equations giving the values of T+ , T\u2212 , N+ , N\u2212 as a function\nof the measured local slope tan(\u03b8)[45] and applied load L, and of the unknown parameters\n\u03bc and c:\n\u03bc + tan(\u03b8) + (c + \u03bcA)/(L cos(\u03b8))\n1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8) + (c + \u03bcA) tan(\u03b8)/(L cos(\u03b8))\n= L cos(\u03b8)\n+A\n1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n\u03bc \u2212 tan(\u03b8) + (c + \u03bcA)/(L cos(\u03b8))\n= L\n1 + \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8) \u2212 (c + \u03bcA) tan(\u03b8)/(L cos(\u03b8))\n+A\n= L cos(\u03b8)\n1 + \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n\nT+ = L\nN+\nT\u2212\nN\u2212\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting Eqs. 11 into Eqs. 5, we obtain a set of equations from whom we aim to extract\nthe values of the friction coefficient \u03bc and the offset c:\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8)\n(c + \u03bcA)/ cos(\u03b8)\n+\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03bc tan (\u03b8)\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\nL tan(\u03b8)(1 + \u03bc2 ) \u03bc(c + \u03bcA) tan(\u03b8)/ cos(\u03b8)\n+\n\u2206 = Tinstr (L) +\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n\nW = L\u03bc\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nHere we have three unknown (Tinstr , \u03bc and c) and only two equations. We may exploit\nthe linearity of Eq. 12 in the applied load, in the form:\nW \u2261 \u03bcapp L + capp\n\n(14)\n\nto extract the slope and the offset, both depending on the unknown \u03bc and c. The effect of\na local tilt of the surface is the introduction of an apparent friction coefficient \u03bcapp and an\napparent friction offset capp :\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8)\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n(c + \u03bcA)/cos(\u03b8)\ncapp (\u03bc, c, \u03b8, A) =\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n\u03bcapp (\u03bc, \u03b8) = \u03bc\n\n12\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\n\fThe linearity of Eq. 14 is a necessary condition for the validity of the assumption of the\nmodified Amonton's law (only a necessary, and not sufficient condition !). Notice that,\nbecause of the dependence of Tinstr on load L, we can not exploit Eq. 13 to extract the true\nvalues of \u03bc and c as for Eq. 12.\nIn the last equation we have explicitly indicated the dependence of Tinstr on the load L.\nIf the derivative of \u2206 with respect to L is computed, as in the calibration procedure for the\nlateral sensitivity \u03b1 described by Ogletree et al. [24], the residual term dTinstr /dL can make\nthe calibration procedure inaccurate (see discussion below).\nEq. 15 represents the well known topographic correction proposed by Bushan et al. [12]\nIt is a 2nd-order equation whose meaningful root is the true friction coefficient \u03bc. This\ntopographic correction holds under the assumptions that the friction is linearly dependent\non the load and that the instrumental offset does not change in Trace and Retrace.\nBecause of the residual offset due to adhesion, the apparent friction coefficient \u03bcapp must\nbe calculated via a fit of the W vs. L curve, and not simply as: \u03bcapp = W/L. This offset\nis present even in case a simple Coulomb-Amonton's law is assumed (i.e. c = 0), and\nfollows from considering explicitly the adhesion force in the decomposition of forces acting\non the AFM tip (see Fig. 3). In the case of a flat surface (\u03b8 = 0) Eq. 18 reduces to the\nAmonton's-Coulomb equation: f = \u03bc(L + A).\nWe end this section with some consideration about the application of the equations of\nthe topographic corrections in the case of adhesive multi-asperity contact for the calculation\nof the cantilever lateral sensitivity \u03b1 proposed by Ogletree et al. in Ref. 24. Omitting the\noffset c in Eqs. 11-13, the following set of equations is obtained:\n\u03bc + tan(\u03b8)\n\u03bcA/L cos(\u03b8)\n+\n1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8) 1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\nA\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8)\n+\n= L cos(\u03b8)\n1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8) 1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n\u03bc \u2212 tan(\u03b8)\n\u03bcA/L cos(\u03b8)\n= L\n+\n1 + \u03bc tan(\u03b8) 1 \u2212 \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\nA\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8)\n+\n= L cos(\u03b8)\n1 + \u03bc tan(\u03b8) 1 + \u03bc tan(\u03b8)\n\nT+ = L\nN+\nT\u2212\nN\u2212\n\n(17)\n\nand\nW = L\u03bc\n\n\u03bcA/ cos(\u03b8)\n1 + tan2 (\u03b8)\n+\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan (\u03b8) 1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n13\n\n(18)\n\n\f\u2206 = Tinstr (L) +\n\nL tan(\u03b8)(1 + \u03bc2 ) \u03bc2 A tan(\u03b8)/ cos(\u03b8)\n+\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)\n\n(19)\n\nOgletree et al. obtained a set of equations slightly different from our Eqs. 18 and 19,\nbecause of the neglecting of adhesion A in the decomposition of forces along the normal\ndirection. This however does not affect in principle the calculation of the lateral sensitivity\n\u03b1 because this is based on the derivatives of Eqs. 18 and 19 with respect to L. Derivation\nis supposed to clean off the offsets, as long as the dependence of Tinstr on load L in Eq. 19\nis weak. More precisely, in Eq. 19 the derivative of Tinstr versus L must be (much) smaller\nthan the term x = tan(\u03b8)(1 + \u03bc2 )/(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)). The procedure we have described in\nsection III for the measurement of the instrumental offset, can be used to inquiry whether\nthe method proposed by Ogletree et al. can be applied. If the derivative of Tinstr versus\nL is comparable to x, the laser alignment should be optimized. This procedure should be\nfollowed each time a new cantilever is used, in order to validate the goodness of the laser\nalinement and minimize the unwanted effects of cross-talking. The main drawback of this\nprocedure is that it requires a knowledge of both the tilt angle of the reference grating and\nthe friction coefficient of the tip-grating pair.\n\nVI.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nWe have developed a complete quantitative protocol for the quantitative characterization\nof the friction properties of corrugated surfaces using the AFM, based on the equations\nderived so far.\nWe have used a Nanoscope Multimode IIIa AFM, that can be housed in a sealed chamber\nconnected to a humidifier in order to work in controlled humidity and atmosphere (typically\nin dry and wet nitrogen). The deflection setpoint, determining the external applied load, is\nremotely controlled by a PC. The application of the load is synchronized with the end-line\nand end-frame triggers from the microscope, such that we can acquire a complete friction vs.\nload curve in a single AFM scan of typically 512 lines, 512 points per line. The experimental\ndata are exported and post-processed via dedicated routines. Cantilever force constant k\nand lateral sensitivity \u03b1 are calibrated using the thermal noise method [37, 38, 39, 40] and\nthe wedge method proposed by Ogletree et al. [24]. Our calibration methods do not require\nany analytical calculation based neither on the assumption of any oversimplified cantilever\n14\n\n\fgeometry nor on SEM measurements, nor on any knowledge of the elastic properties of the\ncantilever material.\nOur protocol requires the acquisition of four maps: the topographic map, the lateral\nforce maps acquired in trace and retrace (i.e. the T R and RET R maps in volts) and\nthe deflection setpoint map proportional to the external applied load L. These four maps\nshould be recorded simultaneously because they are strictly in one-by-one correspondence.\nHowever, only up to two independent signals apart from the topographic one can be recorded\nsimultaneously by our AFM controller. We record the topographic and lateral force maps\ntogether and the deflection setpoint map separately, because this is a quite stable and\nreproducible signal. We scan on the same line during one ramp, and repeat the ramp on\ndifferent points. Adhesion is extracted from force versus distance curves acquired on a flat\nregion of the sample. We repeat the adhesion measurement many times applying offsets in\nthe xy directions and then averaging, in order to reduce the errors coming from the local\ncorrugation of the surface. Assuming a constant adhesion across the whole scan window,\nan adhesion map A is readily obtained. Tip velocity is typically 1 \u03bcm/s, scan size is up to\n1 \u03bcm, and resolution is 512 points per line. In each lateral force map we can change the\napplied load up to 512 times. Load range is typically 0-100 nN.\nTopographic and lateral force maps are first smoothed using a one-dimensional kernel\nwhose size equals the tip size (in point units), in order to smooth out all the information\nthat are below the effective resolution limit. The map of local slopes tan(\u03b8) is calculated\nfrom the topographic map, with a resolution equal to the tip radius R, so that we have\ntan(\u03b8) \u223c tan(\u03b8)R (see section II). At this point we calculate W from T R and RET R\n(Eq. 4). The map of local slopes, the map of external loads L, and the W map are in oneto-one correspondence. Making a sampling of the slope map and exploiting the one-to-one\ncorrespondence with other maps, the family of sets {W, L}\u03b8 is obtained, each containing the\npairs {W, L} corresponding to points in the topographic map having the same slope. Each\nset gives a W vs. L characteristics (an example is shown in Fig. 5) that in turn can be\nfitted to extract the apparent friction coefficient \u03bcapp (\u03bc, \u03b8) and the apparent adhesive offset\ncapp (\u03bc, c, \u03b8, A).\n\nThe linear fit is weighted with errors on both W and L coming from the\n\nindetermination on the vertical force constant k, z -sensitivity z-sens, and lateral sensitivity\n\u03b1 (see Appendix ). From the apparent friction coefficient \u03bcapp , given the slope tan(\u03b8), the\ntrue friction coefficient \u03bc is extracted (Eq. 15). From the apparent adhesive offset capp , given\n15\n\n\fthe slope, the adhesion map, and the friction coefficient \u03bc, the adhesive offset c is extracted\n(Eq. 16). The propagation of errors is taken into account in order to determine the error\non both \u03bc and c (Eqs. A.7 and A.12). The errors calculated for \u03bc and c are in turn used to\nobtain the weighted distributions of measured values of \u03bc and c (Fig. 6). Finally, average\nvalues and standard deviations are obtained fitting the histograms with gaussian curves.\n\nVII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn order to illustrate the importance of the topographic correction for the measurement\nof the friction coefficient of corrugated surfaces with FFM, we compare the lateral force dispersion measured by FFM on a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sample with the theoretical\npredictions of Eq. 12, evaluated using the measured values of the friction coefficient and\nadhesive offsets.\nThe dispersion of the measured lateral force values is shown in Fig. 7.\n\nThe friction\n\ncoefficient and the adhesive offset, as measured with the topographic correction procedure,\nare \u03bc = 0.057 \u00b1 0.009 and c = 0.81 \u00b1 0.17 nN. Other parameters are: \u03b1 = 30 nN/V, k = 0.1\nN/m, zsens=116 nm/V and adhesion A = 7 nN. The lateral force dispersion of the PTFE\ncorrugated sample simulated using Eq. 12 is shown in Fig. 8 (the distribution of tilt angles\nof the PTFE sample is shown in the inset, together with a topographic profile). The effect\nof the presence of a distribution of tilt angles at the sample surface is the coexistance in\nFig. 8 of several linear trends, one stronger (corresponding to the intense peaks in the tilt\nangle distribution between -10 and -20 degs) and the others wicker. In the experimental\ndispersion we find qualitatively the same trend, although the statistical noise makes the\ndifferent linear trends mixing and broadening. The topographic correction would make all\nthe linear trends collapse into one. Neglecting the topographic correction would likely lead\nto inaccurate measurements of the friction coefficient. In order to quantify the error induced\nby the presence of a distribution of tilt angles at the sample surface, we plot in Fig. 9 the\nrelative error (\u03bcapp \u2212\u03bc)/\u03bc, calculated from Eq. 15, versus the tilt angle. In the calculation of\n(\u03bcapp \u2212 \u03bc)/\u03bc we assumed \u03bc = 0.05, although the result is largely independent on the value of\n\u03bc. It can be noticed that for tilt angles bigger than about 20 degs the discrepancy increases\nrapidly above 10% and becomes larger than 70% at 40 degs. The slopes in the region of\nthe leading trends in Fig. 7 span approximately from 0.056 to 0.061. The difference is of\n16\n\n\fthe order of 10%, which is the expected deviation induced by tilt angles below 20 degrees.\nThe topographic correction is required as long as the mean tilt is larger than about 15-20\ndegrees.\nThe presence of a distribution of tilt angles amplifies the statistical noise on the measured values of the lateral force. In addition, it must be considered that often additional\ntrends are present in the lateral force map, due to those contributions to friction which are\nnot accounted for by the topographic correction, such as the ploughing and the collision\neffect [12], etc... Even in the case of small tilt angles, the topographic correction procedure\ncan help in minimizing the effects of this noise.\nThe validity of the friction model that we have adopted in the topographic correction\nprocedure can be verified a posteriori from the linearity of the experimental W vs. L curves\nand from the values of the adhesive offset c. We have found that the modified Amonton's\nlaw is appropriate in describing the frictional behaviour of a number of systems in ambient\nconditions (nanostructured carbon films grown via Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition [41],\nPTFE-based coatings obtained through syntherization of nanoemulsions [42], and silicon) ,\nfor loads below 100 nN. The measured values of the adhesive offset c were always different\nfrom zero, in the limit of the experimental error. Typical values of the adhesive offset\nmeasured are up to few nanonewtons. If this offset was due to a mere uncertainty in the\nmeasurement of the adhesion force, we should assume a relative error in its measurement\nlarger than 100%. For smaller values of c, well below 1 nN, relative errors in A of the\norder 20-40% could in fact be compatible with the simple Coulomb equation (see Eq. 9).\nHowever, if the adhesion force is carefully extracted averaging over many force vs. distance\ncurves, we believe that the error associated can be of the order of 10%. We are thus\nconfident that our experimental data support the validity of the modified Amonton's law\nas an effective friction model, whose origin must be deeply investigated in the framework\nof adhesive contact mechanics. We finally notice that if wear takes place during scanning,\nthe tip-sample interface and, consequently, the adhesion force would change. This would\nrepresent an additional source of noise, in that the value of adhesion used in the fit would\nnot correspond to the actual ones. This effect can be minimized, if not avoided, operating\nthe microscope in the low-load regime.\nWe point out finally that the relative errors in the measured friction coefficients and\nadhesive offsets are typically comparable with that of the factor zsens * k/\u03b1, which basically\n17\n\n\fconvert the friction coefficient extracted from the experimental data in Volts into the true\none. This error is typically 15-30%, depending on the accuracy of the cantilever calibration\nprocedures. This error can be considered systematic and can be reduced only improving\nthe accuracy of the calibration methods (and this is actually one of the bottlenecks of\nnano-friction measurements). The statistical errors in the measured lateral force values are\ninstead efficiently smoothed out by our protocol, because of the large number of points that\nare processed in a single image, the large number of lateral force maps that can be acquired\nin a reasonable time.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have discussed the problem of the topographic correction of lateral force maps, which\nis necessary to obtain quantitative information on the tribological properties of corrugated\nsamples via FFM experiments. We have recognized that there are intrinsic instrumental\nlimitations which reduce the accuracy of these measurements. In particular, the unreliable measurement of the instrumental lateral force offset poses severe limitations to the\napplicability of the topographic correction and should be taken into account whenever the\ndecomposition of forces on a locally tilted surface is considered, such as in the procedure for\nthe calibration of the lateral sensitivity proposed in Ref. 24.\nAssuming that the friction behavior is well described by a modified Amonton's law, where\na constant offset is explicitly considered in order to account for the zero-load friction force\ntypical of single asperity adhesive friction, we have solved the problem of the topographic\ncorrection of FFM lateral force maps and developed a complete protocol, which provide\nquantitative and reliable characterization of frictional properties of corrugated materials.\nThe final error in the measurement is basically due to the uncertainty in the force constants\nof the cantilever and it is typically of the order of 15-30%. Neglecting the topographic\ncorrection on corrugated samples can lead to even larger errors.\nThe frictional model adopted is appropriate to describe the behavior of many systems\nin humid environment. The quantitative assessment of this offset is important in order to\ndetermine the total friction force, for comparison among different materials.\n\n18\n\n\fAPPENDIX: ERROR ANALYSIS\n\nWe extract an apparent friction coefficient \u03bcapp and an apparent offset capp via a linear\nfit of the W vs. L curve (Eq. 12). Notice that the original signals W and L, as well as\nthe adhesion force A, are given in Volts. They must be converted in nanoNewton using the\ncantilever vertical force constant k in N/m and sensitivity z-sens in nm/V , and the lateral\nsensitivity \u03b1 in nN/V . We assume a relative error of 10% for k and \u03b1 and of 2% for z-sens,\nwhich is calculated from the slope of force-vs.-distance curves taken on a hard flat surface,\naveraging over many acquisitions. The relative error for the applied load L is thus 12%,\nthat for the lateral force W is 10%. The linear fit of the W vs. L curve is weighted with the\nerrors of W and L. We use the error of A later in the error propagation analysis. Notice\nthat the relative error associated to adhesion (15%) comes from the force constant ( 10%)\nand from the statistical error associated to the extraction of the adhesion force from many\nforce vs. distance curves ( 5%). The error in z-sens does not contribute to the error of A\nbecause the depth of the pull-off region in the approaching-retracting curve is calculated on\nthe retraction length axis directly in nm with good accuracy. \u03bc and c are the true incognitae\nof the problem, while A, \u03b8, W and L are known or measured, each with its own error. From\nEqs. 15 and 16 we have:\n\u03bc(\u03bcapp , \u03b8) =\n\n2 (\u03b8)\n\u2212 1+tan\n\u03bcapp\n\n+\n\nr\n\n2\n\n(\u03b8) 2\n) + 4 tan2 (\u03b8)\n( 1+tan\n\u03bcapp\n\n2 tan2 (\u03b8)\nc(\u03bc, capp , \u03b8, A) = capp cos(\u03b8)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 tan2 (\u03b8)) \u2212 \u03bcA\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\nWe apply standard error propagation analysis to Eqs.
