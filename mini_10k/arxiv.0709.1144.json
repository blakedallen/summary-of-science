There are departures from homogeneity and isotropy that are now\nwell-quantified by measurements of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) and galaxy surveys. In current\ncosmological theory, the notions of homogeneity and\nisotropy have been superseded by the notions of statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The density of matter\nmay differ from one point in the Universe to another,\nbut the distribution of matter is described as a realization of a random field with a variance that is everywhere\nthe same and the same in every direction. This is generally the prediction of structure-formation models, and in\nparticular, of inflationary models.\nStill, statistical isotropy and homogeneity are assumptions that can be tested quantitatively, and the precision\nwith which they can be tested is improving rapidly with\nthe still-accumulating wealth of cosmological data. Preliminary (and controversial) indications for a preferred\ndirection in the CMB [1, 2, 3, 4] have recently motivated\nthe study of departures from statistical isotropy. Subsequent theoretical work has shown that although statistical isotropy is a generic prediction of inflation, inflation\nmodels can in fact be constructed to violate statistical\nisotropy [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Dark-energy\nmodels might also accommodate departures from statistical isotropy [15, 16]. These models provide useful straw\nmen against which the success of the standard inflationary predictions of statistical isotropy can be quantified.\nThe growing interest in such models motivates us to\nstudy generalized tests for statistical isotropy. In a statistically isotropic Universe, the primordial distribution of\nmatter is a realization of a random field in which Fourier\nmodes of the density field have variances, a power spectrum P (k), that depend only on the magnitude k of the\nwavevector k. If we drop the assumption of statistical\nisotropy, the power spectrum will depend on the direction k\u0302 as well. If \u03b4(k) is the Fourier amplitude of the\n\nfractional density perturbation, then the power spectrum\nis defined by\nh\u03b4(k)\u03b4 \u2217 (k\u2032 )i = \u03b4D (k \u2212 k\u2032 )P (k),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the angle brackets denote an average over all realizations of the random field, and \u03b4D is a Dirac delta\nfunction; note that we are still preserving the assumption that different Fourier modes are uncorrelated. The\nmost general power spectrum can then be written,\n\"\n#\nX\nP (k) = A(k) 1 +\ngLM (k)YLM (k\u0302) ,\n(2)\nLM\n\nwhere YLM (k\u0302) (with L \u2265 2) are spherical harmonics, and\ngLM (k) quantify the departure from statistical isotropy\nas a function of wavenumber k. Since the density field is\nreal, Fourier modes for k are related to those of \u2212k, in\nsuch a way that the multipole moment L must be even. In\nthe limit gLM (k) \u2192 0, we recover the usual statistically\nisotropic theory with power spectrum A(k). The implementation, Eq. (2), of power anisotropy is motivated in\npart by the inflationary model of Ref. [10], which predicts\ng2M (k) 6= 0.\nHere we consider several CMB tests for statistical\nisotropy. The first, which we refer to as \"power multipole moments,\" is a simple and intuitive estimator that\ninvolves measurement of the multipole moments of the\nsquare of the temperature/polarization fields.1 As an\nexample, we apply this statistic to an inflationary model\n[10] that predicts a quadrupole in the matter power spectrum.\n\n1\n\nThere has already been some evidence for a dipole in the CMB\npower [2, 4] that is analogous to the higher multipole moments that we are considering here, but which cannot be due\nto anisotropy in the primordial power spectrum because it has\nL = 1. There have also been searches [3] for anisotropy along the\nlines considered here, and Ref. [17, 18] discusses similar statistics.\n\n\f2\nAlthough power multipole moments provide a nice\nmodel-independent test for departures from statistical\nisotropy, more sensitive probes can be developed if the\nparticular form of the departure is specified. To illustrate, we thus construct the minimum-variance estimators for the anisotropy coefficients gLM (k) under the\nassumption that they are constants. The naive power\nmultipole moments, although intuitively simple, co-add\na number of modes with equal weight. The minimumvariance estimator co-adds modes with weights that depend on their signal to noise, so that (as the name suggests) the variance of the estimator is minimized. We\nshow that this statistic provides a far stronger probe for\nthe gLM s.\nThe plan of our paper is as follows: Section II reviews\nsome CMB basics. Section III calculates the correlations\nof CMB spherical-harmonic coefficients if there are departures from statistical isotropy. As we discuss there,\nthe power spectrum Cl , which describes the two-point\nCMB statistics if there is statistical isotropy, is generalized to a set of moments DllLM\nif statistical isotropy is\n\u2032\nbroken. In Section IV, we introduce and calculate the\npower multipole moments and calculate the standard errors with which these moments can be recovered. We\napply this statistic to a quadrupole in the matter power\nspectrum, calculating the sensitivities of several CMB\nexperiments to such a quadrupole. Section V discusses\nminimum-variance estimators for the quantities DllLM\n\u2032\nthat parametrize the departures gLM (k) from statistical\nisotropy. We then construct from these the minimumvariance estimators for the quadrupole moments of the\nprimordial power spectrum, calculate their variance, and\nevaluate their sensitivity to departures from statistical\nisotropy. We make some concluding remarks in Section VI. Throughout the main body of the paper, we\ndiscuss statistics for only a temperature map, in order\nto make the presentation clear. An Appendix generalizes to include the full temperature-polarization information. Our numerical results are for a full temperaturepolarization map, as well as for temperature or polarization alone.\n\nII.\n\ndent for different l and m: halm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i = Cl \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032 .2 The\nset of Cl s is the CMB temperature power spectrum. We\nwill see that when statistical isotropy is violated, there\nare correlations induced between alm s for different l and\nm [10]. If there is statistical isotropy, the two-point autocorrelation function is\nC(n\u0302, n\u0302\u2032 ) = hT (n\u0302)T (n\u0302\u2032 )i\nX 2l + 1\nCl Pl (n\u0302 * n\u0302\u2032 );\n= T02\n4\u03c0\n\ni.e., the correlation function depends only on the separation between the two points. If statistical isotropy is\nviolated, this is not necessarily true.\n\nIII.\n\nOFF-DIAGONAL CORRELATIONS FOR\nANISOTROPIC POWER\n\nConsider a primordial matter power spectrum P (k)\ngiven by Eq. (2).

[18],\nand they recover the results of Ref. [10] for L = 2.\nIf primordial perturbations are statistically isotropic\nand Gaussian, then the statistics of the CMB temperature map are specified fully by the power spectrum, the\nset of Cl s. If primordial perturbations have a departure\nfrom statistical isotropy that can be written in terms of\nspherical harmonics YLM (k\u0302), then the two-point statistics are described additionally by the set of multipole\nmoments DllLM\n\u2032 . These quantities are thus the generalization of the Cl s if there is statistical anisotropy.\nIV.\n\nPOWER MULTIPOLE MOMENTS\nA.\n\nTheoretical predictions\n\nIt is natural to expect that a spherical-harmonic pattern of anisotropy in the matter power spectrum manifests itself in a similar pattern in the CMB power. It is\nthus natural to consider a set of \"power multipole moments,\"\nZ\n1\n\u2217\nbLM = 2 dn\u0302 YLM\n(11)\n(n\u0302) T 2 (n\u0302),\nT0\nwhere T 2 (n\u0302) = C(n\u0302, n\u0302) is the expectation value of the\nsquare of the temperature at position n\u0302 in the sky; it\nis the autocorrelation function at zero lag. With this\nstatistic, we simply look for anisotropies in the power.\nThese statistics have several advantages. In addition\nto having a form familiar from similar statistics [e.g.,\nEq. (3)] for temperature fluctuations, they have simple\nanalytic expressions in terms of P (k). There are also\n(as we show below), relatively simple expressions for the\ncosmic-variance\u2013 and instrumental-noise\u2013induced errors\nin the measurement of these statistics.\nThe variance T 2 (n\u0302) as a function of position n\u0302 is\ngiven by\nX\nT 2 (n\u0302)\n=\nhalm a\u2217l\u2032 m\u2032 i Ylm (n\u0302)Yl\u2217\u2032 m\u2032 (n\u0302).\n2\nT0\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(12)\n\nlml m\n\nWe put this into Eq.

To do so, we consider a full-sky map T map (n\u0302) of the temperature in Npix\nequal-area pixels. The temperature in each pixel receives contributions from signal and from noise. Thus,\nin pixel i, T map = T (n\u0302i ) + Tin , where T (n\u0302i ) is the temperature measured in pixel i, which will be the signal\ntemperature smoothed by a Gaussian beam of full-width\nhalf maximum (fwhm) \u03b8fwhm , plus a noise Tin. We assume that the noise is isotropic and that the noises in\ndifferent pixels are uncorrelated with variance \u03c3T2 : i.e.,\nTin Tjn = \u03c3T2 \u03b4ij . The power spectrum for the map is\nthus Clmap = |Wl |2 Cl + Cln , where Cln = (4\u03c0/Npix )\u03c3T2 is\nthe noise power spectrum, and Wl is a window function\nthat takes into account the effects of beam smearing; for\na Gaussian beam \u221a\nof fwhm \u03b8fwhm , it is Wl = exp(\u2212l2 \u03c3b2 /2)\nwith \u03c3b = \u03b8fwhm / 8 ln 2 = 0.00742(\u03b8fwhm/1\u25e6 ).\nSince the instrumental noise is isotropic by assumption, we get an unbiased estimator for bLM (for L \u2265 2)\nfrom\nZ\n\u2217\nbbmap = 1\ndn\u0302 YLM\n(n\u0302) [T map(n\u0302)]2 .\n(15)\nLM\nT02\nCosmic variance and instrumental noise induce a variance\nin the bLM s, which we define as\nE\nD\n(16)\n\u039eLM \u2261 bbLM bbLM ,\n\nwhere we have assumed the null hypothesis, gLM = 0.\nFor this null hypothesis of a statistically isotropic Gaussian random map,\nZ\n2\nLM\n\u039e\n= 4 dn\u0302 dn\u0302\u2032 C map (n\u0302, n\u0302\u2032 )C map (n\u0302, n\u0302\u2032 )\nT0\n\u2217\n\u00d7YLM (n\u0302)YLM\n(n\u0302\u2032 )\nX\nmap map\n= 2\nGL\nCl\u2032\nll\u2032 Cl\nll\u2032\n\n(17)\n\nwhere C map (n\u03021 , n\u03022 ) is the two-point correlation function\nfor the map, obtained from the expression, Eq.

We assume only scalar\nperturbations and the current best-fit cosmological parameters.\nThe numerical results are given in Table 1, but before\nreviewing them, we provide some very rough estimates\nto get some feel for the numbers. To do so, ignore instrumental noise and suppose that Wl = 1 for all l \u2264 lmax .\nFor L = 2, Fll\u2032 6= 0 only for l\u2032 = l or l\u2032 = l \u00b1 2. Moreover,\nfor these combinations of ll\u2032 and for l \u226b 2, we approximate the numerical results (which we use for the numerical results in the Table) for Fll\u2032 as Fl,l+2 \u2243 \u22120.5 Cl .\n20 2\n20\nAlso, (Cl0l0\n) \u223c (5/8)l\u22121 for l \u226b 1, and (Cl0(l\u00b12)0\n)2 is\n1.5 times as large.\nP can then be approximated\nP Eq.

For example, using\n\u03c3g22M \u223c 128\u03c0lmin\nlmin = 2 and lmax = 1000 yields \u03c3g2M \u223c 1.23.\nOf course, there is nothing about the derivation of\nEq. (18) that is specific to a temperature map, and this\nresult can be applied equally well, e.g., to the E-mode\npolarization. If we approximate the polarization power\n\u22122\n,\nspectrum by Cl \u223c const, then we find \u03c3g22M \u2243 512\u03c0lmax\n\u22122\nor \u03c3g2M \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 for lmax \u2243 1000.\nWe now return to the numerical results for \u03c3g2M listed\nin Table 1 for the Wilkinson Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\n[20], which has now collected three years of data, the\nPlanck satellite [21], to be launched in 2008, and EPIC\n[22], a satellite mission currently under study. The parameters assumed for each model are listed, as well as results obtained using Eq. (14) assuming only TT is used or\nEE only. The Appendix generalizes Eq. (14) to the case\nwhere the full temperature-polarization is used (including the TE correlation), and we present numerical results\n\n3\n\np\nNote that our g20 is (2/3) 4\u03c0/5g\u2217 , where g\u2217 is the coefficient\nin Ref. [10] of (k\u0302 * \u1e91)2 if the preferred direction is taken to be \u1e91.\n\nfor this case in the Table as well. We also list results, labeled \"CVO\" (cosmic variance only), for a hypothetical\nexperiment that has perfect angular resolution and no\ninstrumental noise. These numbers are for hypothetical\nfull-sky experiments, but a realistic experiment will likely\nonly be able to use \u223c 65% of the sky for cosmology. If so,\nthen each estimate for \u03c3g2M must be increased by a factor (0.65)\u22121/2 , about 25%. We also note that the theory\ncannot specify the direction \u00ea of the quadrupole, and so\na search for a quadrupole would require evaluation of all\nfive g2M s. A \"3\u03c3\" detection would thus require that the\nsum of the squares of the g2M s need to exceed (3\u03c3g2M )2 ,\nwhich is independent of M .\nThe order of magnitude that we would expect for \u03c3g2M\n\u22121/2\n2\nis the number of resoluis \u223c Npix , where Npix \u223c lmax\ntion elements on the sky, comparable to the precision\nwith which one can measure the variance (the monopole)\nof the temperature-fluctuation amplitude. The numerical results listed in Table 1 for the error to g2M obtained\nfrom the power quadrupole moment bb2M are not quite as\n\u22121/2\ngood as this Npix expectation. The origin of this discrepancy can be traced to two sources. First of all, the\ntwo-dimensional CMB signal is degraded from the threedimensional power spectrum; a Fourier mode in the \u1e91\ndirection gives rise to some temperature fluctuation near\nthe north pole, and not just at the equator. This is manifest in the large coefficients (e.g., the factor of 512\u03c0) in\nour analytic estimates.\nHowever, another reason that the estimator bb2M does\nnot provide a sensitive probe of a quadrupole departure\nfrom statistical isotropy is that it is not an optimal estimator for g2M . This estimator sums the \"signals\" DllLM\n\u2032 ,\nbut it does not weight these signals properly. This can\nbe seen by noting that for a Cl \u221d l\u22122 power spectrum,\nfor example, the error obtained from Eq. (18) can be reduced by applying a low-pass filter: i.e., by increasing the\nminimum values of ll\u2032 in the sums. (A simple calculation\nshows that with the properly chosen lower-l limit, \u03c3g2M\ncan be reduced by a factor of 30.) If the precision of the\nresult is improved by removing data, then something is\nsub-optimal.\n\nV.\n\nTHE MINIMUM-VARIANCE ESTIMATOR\nA.\n\nThe estimator and its variance\n\nThe bbLM estimator is a simple and intuitive quantity\nthat can be measured to test for statistical isotropy in\na model-independent way. However, if one has a specific theory, defined by the functions gLM (k) or some\nquantities that parametrize the gLM (k), then there will\nbe estimators that can be constructed to measure optimally those parameters. For example, if the gLM s are\nall constants, then one can measure them better than\nthe numerical results for the power multipole moments\nbLM would suggest.

We return to\nEq. (14) and note that bmap\nLM can be written as a sum\nover DllLM,map\n\u2261 DllLM\n\u2032 Wl Wl\u2032 . We then return to Eq.

If l = l\u2032 , we sum only over m\u2032 \u2265 m to avoid\ndouble-counting pairs. However, the factor (1 + \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4mm\u2032 )\nthen weights the m = m\u2032 modes twice as much, if l = l\u2032 ,\nand thus allows us to re-write the sum over all m and\nm\u2032 .

We then sum\nthese, inversely weighted by their variance to obtain the\nminimum-variance estimator,\n\ngbLM =\n\n\u001c\u0010\n\u00112 \u001d\u22121\nLM,map\nLM,map\nb\nb\nDll\u2032\nl\u2032 \u2265l Fll\u2032 Wl Wl\u2032 Dll\u2032\n,\n\u001c\u0010\n\u00112 \u001d\u22121\nP\n2\nLM,map\nb\nDll\u2032\nl\u2032 \u2265l (Fll\u2032 Wl Wl\u2032 )\n\nP\n\n(23)\nobtained from the entire map.

Again, in this case, the only ll\u2032 combinations that\ncontribute are l\u2032 = l and l\u2032 = l \u00b1 2. We assume l, l\u2032 \u226b 1,\napproximate Fl,l+2 \u2243 \u22120.5 Cl , as above, and evaluate\nLM\nCl0l\n\u2032 0 as in Section IV C.

For the WMAP and\nPlanck temperature maps, lmax is roughly 650 and 2000,\nrespectively, implying \u03c3g2M \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 and 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nrespectively, implying very significant improvements in\nthe sensitivity over the power multipole moments.\nTable 1 lists the exact numerical results, obtained\nby evaluating Eq. (24) exactly, for both TT only and\nEE only. Again, the Appendix generalizes Eq. (24) for\nthe full temperature-polarization map, including the TE\n\n\f6\ncross-correlation, and numerical results for this case are\nalso included. The Table shows that by weighting the\nmodes correctly, we get an improvement of a factor of \u223c 2\nfor WMAP and Planck EE and more than an order-ofmagnitude improvement for WMAP and Planck TT; this\nis in accord with our arguments that the signal-to-noise in\nthe TT power multipole moments was particularly poorly\nchosen. Although EPIC will have vastly improved instrumental sensitivity, with its modest angular resolution, it\nis not particularly well suited to search for departures\nfrom statistical isotropy. Again, the minimum-variance\nnumbers in the Table must be increased by about 25%\nto account for partial-sky coverage. And again, since the\npreferred direction is not known a priori, the sum of the\nsquares of the g2M s must exceed (3\u03c3g2M )2 to claim a \"3\u03c3\"\ndetection of a departure of statistical isotropy.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe have considered CMB tests for the statistical\nisotropy of the primordial power spectrum. The power\nspectrum of Eq. (2) is the most general power spectrum\nif the assumption of statistical isotropy is dropped. In\nthe more general case, the CMB power spectrum Cl is\ngeneralized to a set of moments DllLM\n\u2032 , which are closely\nanalogous to the bipolar-spherical-harmonic coefficients\nof Refs. [17]. The power multipole moments bLM provide simple and intuitive statistics that can be used to\nsearch in a model-independent way for departures from\nstatistical isotropy. If, however, a particular model is\nintroduced by specifying a particular parametrization of\nthe functions gLM (k), then minimum-variance statistics\ncan be introduced to improve the precision with which\nthese parameters can be constrained. For example, we\nconstructed explicitly the minimum-variance estimators\nfor the coefficients gLM for the case in which they are\nk-independent. We applied these results to a model in\nwhich there is a quadrupole in the primordial power\nspectrum, and the results are shown in Table 1. We\nsee that the best probe of a primordial quadrupole moment will come from Planck TT, for which we anticipate \u03c3g2M = 0.0052. Multiplying this by 1.25 to account\nfor a 65% sky coverage, and then by the factor of 3 required for a \"3\u03c3\" detection, we find that the smallest\nquadrupole amplitude that will be detectable by Planck\nwill be around 2.0%.\nTo reduce clutter in the equations and to keep the main\nline of reasoning clear, we have derived equations in the\nmain body of the paper for the case where either the\ntemperature or the polarization is used, but not both.\nThe Appendix generalizes the analysis to allow the use of\nthe full temperature-polarization information, including\nthe TE cross-correlation.\nWhat about other probes? Consider, for example, the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey [23]. The volume and galaxy\ndensity of the main galaxy survey allows measurement,\nroughly speaking, of the amplitudes of Nmodes \u223c 105 in-\n\ndependent Fourier modes of the density field, in the linear regime, and these measurements are cosmic-variance\nlimited. Measurement of the quadrupole of the power\nspectrum can then simply be done by comparing the amplitudes of Fourier modes in different directions. The\nstandard error\nmoments will thus\npto the power multipole\n2/Nmodes \u223c 10\u22122 , comparable in order\nbe \u03c3gLM \u223c\nof magnitude to what can be achieved with the CMB.\nOf course, a realistic search will be hampered by the irregular volume of the survey, redshift-space distortions,\nand anisotropies (line-of-sight\u2013versus\u2013angular) inherent\nto the measurement technique. But then again, there\nwill be degradations (foregrounds, sky cuts, etc.) to the\nidealized CMB measurements we have considered. Of\ncourse, if gLM (k) varies with k, then the constraints provided by the CMB and galaxy surveys will be complementary, to the extent that the wavenumbers k probed\nby the CMB and galaxy surveys differ. Looking forward,\nthere is ultimately the possibility of accessing with 21-cm\nfluctuations approximately 1015 modes of the primordial\ndensity field [24], allowing values as small as gLM \u223c 10\u22127\nto be probed, but this is in the very far future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank D.

Considering both\nin tandem will provide some improvement in the result,\nbut given the temperature-polarization cross-correlation,\nthis improvement will be weaker than what would be obtained by simply adding the two results in quadrature.\nStill, to be complete, we include expressions for theory\nand estimators for a combined temperature-polarization\nmap. Assuming only primordial density perturbations\ncontribute to the temperature-polarization map, a map of\nthe sky will now provide the E-mode polarization E(n\u0302),\nconstructed in the usual fashion [25, 26] from the measured Stokes parameters Q(n\u0302) and U (n\u0302), in addition to\nthe temperature T (n\u0302).
