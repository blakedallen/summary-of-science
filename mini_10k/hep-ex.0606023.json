INTRODUCTION\nThe PIBETA experiment at the Paul Scherrer\nInstitute (PSI) is a collaboration of seven institutions that collected the world largest sample of\nrare pion and muon decays during the 1999-2001\nand 2004 beam periods [1].\nThe PIBETA detector system is based on a\nlarge acceptance 240-module pure CsI electromagnetic shower calorimeter. The detector includes with an active degrader AD, a segmented\nactive target AT, a 20-bar cylindrical plastic scintillator veto PV for particle identification, a pair\nof tracking cylindrical multi-wire proportional\nchambers MWPC1/2 and an active cosmic veto\nshield [2].\nA schematic drawing of the detector is shown\nin Fig. 1. The incident 114 MeV/c \u03c0 + beam with\na minimal e+ /\u03bc+ contamination was tagged with\na thin forward beam counter BC, slowed down in\nthe degrader and ultimately stopped in a tight\n\u03c3x,y \u2243 9 mm spot in the active target. The\n1999-2001 runs, optimized for the pion beta decay\nmeasurement, used beam fluxes of up to 1 MHz.\nBeam intensities of 50-200 \u03c0 + /s were used in the\n2004 for optimal acquisition of radiative decay\nevents.\nThe recorded data, comprising 2.2 * 1013 \u03c0 +\nstops, were obtained by a dedicated two-arm\nhigh-threshold trigger as well as 11 physics\n\u2217 for\n\n(i)\npure\n\nCsI\n\nPV\n\u03c0+\n\nAC1\n\nMWPC1\n\nbeam\n\nBC\n\nAD\nAC2\n\nAT\nMWPC2\n\n10 cm\n\n(ii)\n\nFigure 1. Pibeta detector: (i) cross-sectional view\nshowing the major detector sub-systems, and (ii)\n240-module pure CsI calorimeter geometry.\n\nthe PIBETA Collaboration\n\n1\n\n\f2\nfull extent of radiative corrections which stand at\n\u223c 3 % [8].\nThe fast analog hardware triggers were designed to accept nearly all non-prompt \u03c0\u03b2 and\nand a sample of prescaled \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd events with\nindividual shower energy exceeding the Michel\nendpoint (high threshold \u2243 52 MeV).\nThe data analysis provided clean distributions\nof 64,047 \u03c0\u03b2 decay events which agreed very well\nwith energy, angular and timing spectra predicted\nby the GEANT3 Monte Carlo detector simulations. The cosmic muon, prompt, radiative pion\nand accidental backgrounds were determined to\nbe < 1/700 of the \u03c0\u03b2 signal, Fig. 2.\nWe have chosen to normalize the \u03c0\u03b2 yield to\nthe yield of \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd events whose branching\nratio is known with 0.33 % uncertainty experimentally [9,10] and \u2264 0.05 % accuracy theoretically [11,12]. Using the PDG [13] recommended\nexp\nvalue of R\u03c0\u2192e\u03bd\n= 1.230(4)*10\u22124, we find the pion\nbeta branching ratio [14]:\nexp\nR\u03c0\u03b2\n= [1.036 \u00b1 0.004(stat) \u00b1 0.005(syst)]*10\u22128 .\n(1)\n\nWhen normalizing to the theoretical value\nthe\nR\u03c0\u2192e\u03bd\n= 1.2353 * 10\u22124 [11] we obtain:\nFigure 2. Representative pion beta decay experimental spectra: (i) Signal-to-background ratio,\nand (ii) measured life time for the \u03c0\u03b2 events.\n\nand calibration triggers, some of which were\nprescaled.\n2. PION BETA DECAY\nPion beta decay (\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bd) rate offers one\nof the most precise means of testing the conserved\nvector current hypothesis (CVC) [3] and studying the weak u-d quark mixing [4]. The Standard Model (SM) description of the \u03c0\u03b2 decay is\ntheoretically unambiguous within a 0.1 % uncertainty [5,6], but a small \u223c 1 * 10\u22128 branching ratio poses significant experimental chalenges. The\n3.9 % uncertainty of the previous most precise\nmeasurement, made using the \u03c0 0 spectrometer at\nLAMPF [7], was not accurate enough to test the\n\nexp\nR\u03c0\u03b2\n= [1.040 \u00b1 0.004(stat) \u00b1 0.005(syst)]*10\u22128 .\n(2)\nexp\nOur result for R\u03c0\u03b2\nis in excellent agreement with\nthe prediction of the SM:\nSM\nR\u03c0\u03b2\n= (1.038 \u2212 1.041) * 10\u22128 ,\n\n(3)\n\nand stands as the most accurate confirmation of\nthe CVC in a meson to date.\n3. RADIATIVE PION DECAY\nThe radiative pion decay \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3 contributes to the background of the \u03c0\u03b2 process, but\nis also interesting in its own right. Precise measurement of its absolute branching ratio provides\na consistency check of the data analysis, and new\nvalues of the weak axial and vector \u03c0 + form factors, together with limits on the non-(V \u2212A) contributions to Standard Model Lagrangian [15].\n\n\f3\nTable 1\nThe fitted and theoretical values of the absolute branching ratios for three experimentally accessible\nregions of the phase space in the radiative pion decay.\nexp\nmin\nmin\nthe\nEe+\n/E\u03b3min/\u03b8e\u03b3\nRRPD\nRRPD\n\u22128\nMeV/MeV/deg\n(\u00d710 )\n(\u00d710\u22128 )\n50/50/40\u25e6\n2.655(58)\n2.6410(5)\n\u25e6\n10/50/40\n14.59(26)\n14.492(5)\n50/10/40\u25e6\n37.95(60)\n37.90(3)\nexp\nThe fitted RRPD\nvalues are based on 2004 data set.\n\nWe have recorded the radiative pion events in\nthree overlapping phase space regions: (1) region\nA, restricted to e+ -\u03b3 coincident pairs for which\nboth measured energies in the calorimeter were\nEeC+ ,\u03b3 > 55.6 MeV, and for which the opening\nangle was \u03b8eC+ \u03b3 > 40.0\u25e6 (3.0 k events in 2004),\n(2) region B, with measured positron calorimeter energy EeC+ > 20.0 MeV, the photon energy\nE\u03b3C > 55.6 MeV and the relative angle \u03b8eC+ \u03b3 >\n40.0\u25e6 (6.9 k events), and (3) region C, with measured photon calorimeter energy E\u03b3C > 20.0 MeV,\nthe positron energy EeC+ > 55.6 MeV and the relative angle \u03b8eC+ \u03b3 > 40.0\u25e6 (9.1 k events).\nThe signal-to-background timing spectra for all\nthree regions are shown in Fig. 3.\nIn order to account properly for the detector\nenergy-angle resolutions, the experimental partial\nbranching ratios were calculated for larger regions\nlimited by the physical \"thrown\" kinematic variables as shown in Table 1. The integrated radiative corrections of \u22121.0 % (region A), \u22121.4 % (B),\nand \u22123.3 % (C) have been added to the theoretthe\nical RRPD\n[16].\nThe three-dimensional least chi-square (\u03c72 ) fit\nresulted in a new experimental value of the weak\nvector form factor:\nFV (q 2 = 0) = 0.0262 \u00b1 0.0015,\nFigure 3. Signal-to-background ratio for the radiative pion decay candidate events in three regions of the measured phase space (see text for\ndetails).\n\n(4)\n\nand the improved value of the weak axial form\nfactor:\nFA (q 2 = 0) = 0.0118 \u00b1 0.0003,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere q 2 stands for the momentum transfer to\nthe lepton pair.

(6)\nThe above-quoted fit had \u03c72 per degree of freedom of 0.6. The addition of a hypothetical tensor interaction term to the decay amplitude (see\n[17\u201319]) results in the upper limit of |FT (0)| \u2264\n5.1 * 10\u22124 at the 90 % confidence limit [20]. This\nlimit is more than an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the ISTRA collaboration re-analysis result\nreported by Poblaguev [21].\n4. RADIATIVE MUON DECAY\nThe radiative muon decay \u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 measurement provides another critical consistency\ncheck of overall analysis. In the Standard Model\n\nthis process is parameterized via Michel parameters all of which, save \u03b7\u0304, can be determined from\nthe ordinary muon decay [22]. A non-zero value\nof \u03b7\u0304 would imply the non-(V \u2212 A) structure of the\nelectroweak interaction.\nThe most recent direct measurement of \u03b7\u0304 can\nbe interpreted as an upper limit of 0.141 (at 90 %\nCL) [23].\nOur two-dimensional Michel parameter fit\n(\u03c1, \u03b7\u0304) of the 4.2 * 105 radiative muon events collected in 2004 (Fig. 4) corresponds to the upper\nlimit \u03b7\u0304 \u2264 0.060 and simultaneously yields the SM\nvalue \u03c1 = 0.751 \u00b1 0.010 [24]. The details are summarized in Table 2.\n5. RARE \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd DECAY\nWe have proposed to perform a new precise\nmeasurement of the \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd branching ratio\nat PSI using a suitably upgraded PIBETA detector system. The experiment has been approved\nwith high priority in 2006. The measurement is\nmotivated by the fact that at present accuracy of\nthat branching ratio lags behind the theoretical\n\n\f5\nTable 2\nThe optimal values of parameters \u03c1 and \u03b7\u0304 in the radiative muon decay: two-dimensional fit (the first\nline) and the fit with \u03c1 fixed at the Standard Model value (the second line).\n\u03b7\u0304\n\u22120.081 \u00b1 0.054(stat.) \u00b1 0.034(syst.)\n\u22120.084 \u00b1 0.050(stat.) \u00b1 0.034(syst.)\n\n\u03c1\n0.751 \u00b1 0.010\n0.75 (fixed at SM)\n\nexp\nThe fitted RRMD\nvalues are based on 2004 data set.\n\nprecision by an order of magnitude.\nWe will build on our past experience in exploiting the \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd decay for normalizing purposes\n(Fig. 5). We plan to rebuild the target region of\nthe detector and develop the new digitizing detector for the beam counters. The proposed accuracy of the new measurement is \u223c 5 * 10\u22124 or\nlower.\n6. CONCLUSION\nWe have reported new and improved absolute\nbranching ratios for the following rare decays: (1)\n\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+ \u03bd, (2) \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3, and (3) \u03bc+ \u2192\ne+ \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3. The yields of \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd and \u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03bd\ndecays that were used for normalization are also\ninternally consistent when compared to the total\nmeasured number of decaying \u03c0 + 's and \u03bc+ 's [25].\nOur results confirm the CVC hypothesis in the\n\u03c0 + system at 0.55 % level, rule out the tensor\ncontribution in the radiative \u03c0 + decay with the\nform factor |FT | \u2265 5.1 * 10\u22124 (90 % CL), and set\nthe new 90 % CL limit on the parameter \u03b7\u0304 \u2264 0.060\nin the radiative \u03bc+ decay.\nREFERENCES\n1.
