At that stage, the roughly hemispherical oocyte is bounded by a plasma membrane and an underlying cortex\ncomprised of an actin filament meshwork. Long microtubules, with minus ends attached to the cortex, have their\nplus ends free. Kinesin-1 motor proteins that walk along the microtubules toward plus ends generate opposing forces\non the microtubule and the surrounding viscous cytoplasm. Cytoplasm is thus moved toward plus ends, generating\nvigorous flows for mixing. Because minus ends are anchored, the equal but opposite force on a microtubule generates\ndynamic bending along its length. The results of this work have been used to understand this phenomenon in recent\nwork by the authors [1].\nWe begin with the equation for a microtubule with an applied force tangent to the direction of chain. The position\nof the microtubule at arclength s and at time t is denoted r(s, t). As is usual at small scales, all inertial effects are\nnegligible and the system is dominated by the drag coefficient per unit length \u03bd,\n\u03bd\n\n\u2202r\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u22024r\n\u2202r\n= \u2212C 4 +\n(T (s) ) \u2212 fk\n+ \u03bdvs k\u0302.\n\u2202t\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\n(1)\n\nC denotes the elastic bending constant of the microtubule. The tension T (s) enforces the inextensibility of microtubules which can be written as |\u2202r/\u2202s| = 1. Kinesin motors walking along the microtubule are assumed to be\ncarrying cargo that acts as an impeller pushing the surrounding cytoplasmic medium. By Newton's third law, this\nforce produces a drag on the impellers that transmits this force to the attached microtubule. Assuming a high density\nof kinesin walkers, the effective force on the microtubule will be in the direction of the local tangent to r(s) which is\n\u2202r/\u2202s. The coefficient fk gives the strength of the force. Lastly we add a uniform flow field representing the velocity\nof the cytoplasm vs in the vicinity of the microtubule which we take to be in the k\u0302 direction.\nWe rescale to dimensionless variables\n\u03c3 = s/\u03c10 , u = r/\u03c10 , \u03c4 = t\u03c90 , T \u2032 = T \u03c120 /C, and h = \u03bdvs /fk\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202u\n\u2202\n\u22024u\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\n=\u2212 4 +\n(T \u2032 (\u03c3) ) \u2212\n+ hk\u0302.\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202s\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c90 = fk /(\u03bd\u03c10 ), and \u03c130 = C/fk .\n\n(4)\n\nso that\n\nThis requires that\n\n\f3\n\u03c10 and \u03c90 are constants that make our new variables dimensionless.\nWe will consider solutions where one end (the minus end) is tethered to a point, say the origin, so that r(s = 0, t) = 0\nand is freely hinged at that point. The other end is free. The total arclength of the microtubule is denoted by L.\nThe general characteristic of all numerical solutions to Eq. 1 is that for large s the solutions appear to be travelling\nwaves. In fact, the form of solution becomes independent of L so in fact we could consider this problem in the limit\nL \u2192 \u221e. For example we find solutions that asymptotically become helical with a fixed path and radius for large s.\nOther solutions are planar and are periodic in s. In all these cases the solution has the form of a travelling wave that\nwe analyze in detail below.\n\nII.\n\nSTEADY STATE TRAVELLING WAVE SOLUTIONS\n\nNow we look for steady state travelling wave solutions. First we clarify what this means. The whole microtubule\nshould not be translating because one end, (far away from where the travelling wave solution is valid) is tethered.\nThe position averaged over one period of a monomer, hui, should be time independent. If the microtubule is stretched\nout in one particular direction, there should be a displacement ud of the microtubule about a straight line solution,\nu(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = ud (\u03c3 \u2212 v\u03c4 ) + \u03b1\u03c3 k\u0302.\n\n(5)\n\nThe term ud describes a displacement that travels along the backbone of the chain maintaining its shape. Therefore\nwe require\n\u2202hud i\n=0\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting Eq. 5 into Eq. 3 gives a left hand side of \u2212v\u2202ud /\u2202\u03c3 and a term of the form \u2212\u2202ud /\u2202\u03c3 on the right\nhand side. Choosing v = 1 and in addition \u03b1 = h, we are left with\n\n\u22024u\n\u2202\n\u2202u\n+\n(T \u2032 (\u03c3) ) = 0.\n\u2202\u03c3 4\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(7)\n\nWe define w = \u2202u/\u2202\u03c3 and note that the inextensibility requirement |\u2202r/\u2202s| = 1 implies that |w| = 1. We can write\nw=\n\n\u2202ud\n+ \u03b1k\u0302\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(8)\n\nNote that w(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) depends only on \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 . Because w is a function of only one variable \u03be \u2261 \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 , we can integrate\nEq. 7 with respect to \u03be obtaining\nd2 w\n\u2212 T \u2032 (\u03c3)w = \u2212g k\u0302.\nd\u03be 2\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\nThe integration constant on the right hand side \u2212g k\u0302 must lie in the k\u0302 direction by symmetry. This is the same\nequation as that of the classical mechanics of a particle of unit mass, with position w travelling on the surface of a\nunit sphere under the influence of gravity, with the variable \u03be being analogous to time. The term \u2212T \u2032 is a normal\nforce that constrains the particle to stay on the sphere's surface.\nFrom Eq. 6 and Eq. 8 we see that the motion is subject to the constraint\nhwi = \u03b1k\u0302\n\n(10)\n\nThe constant g and the initial conditions of the particle must be chosen so as to satisfy this constraint. There is an\ninfinite number of solutions satisfying these conditions leading to different steady state solutions for the microtubule.\nThe spherical pendulum Eq. 9 has been analyzed [2] in detail. In general the orbits will not be closed, but we will\nrelegate our discussion below to two cases where this is the case, circular motion in Eq. 9, corresponding to helical\nconformations of a microtubule, and motion in the x \u2212 z plane, corresponding to solutions similar in shape to cycloids.\n\nA.\n\nScale Invariant Family of Solutions\n\nOne important point to notice about the general structure of Eq. 9 is its invariance under change of \u03be, that is\n\u03be \u2192 \u03bb\u03be. A change in scale of \u03bb does not modify the solution, because T \u2032 (\u03be) and g are both constraints, and can\ntherefore be chosen arbitrarily. So that if w(\u03be) is a solution to Eq. 9, so is w(\u03bb\u03be). Furthermore all solutions of\nthis form will have the same hwi and hence the same \u03b1. Note that a length scale shift of w = w0 (\u03bb\u03be) corresponds\nto a displacement of u = (1/\u03bb)u0 (\u03bb\u03be), which changes scale because of the 1/\u03bb prefactor in this expression. This\nmeans that for every steady state conformation of the microtubule, there exists a family of steady state solutions with\nidentical shape but arbitrary size.\n\nB.\n\nCircular Orbits\n\nCircular orbits are solutions to Eq. 9. Eq. 10 requires that the vertical height of the orbit be at wz = \u03b1. Therefore\nthe radius perpendicular to k\u0302 (the wx , wy plane) is\nw\u22a5 \u2261\n\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b12 .\n\n(11)\n\nIt is first easiest to analyze this by direct analogy to the classical mechanical problem of a unit mass particle moving\non a unit sphere (the spherical pendulum). If the height above the sphere is \u03b1, then application of Newton's laws\n\n\f5\ngives that the tension must balance the force of gravity g and the centripetal acceleration v 2 /w\u22a5 giving\ng\n\u03b1\n\u2261\nv2\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(12)\n\nWhere v is not the real velocity of the microtubule but |dw\u22a5 /d\u03be|. This is the rate at which the tangent vector rotates\nin the x \u2212 y plane. Because |dud /d\u03be| = |wd | = rc is a constant, wd is a circle. Therefore according to Eq. 5, this will\ngive a helical conformation of the microtubule.\nIn the spherical pendulum analogy, the angular velocity of the particle is \u03a9p = v/w\u22a5 . The total arclength of the\nchain (in dimensionless units) of a single period of the chain is\n2\u03c0R\nS= \u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(13)\n\nand S\u03a9p = 2\u03c0 so that S = 2\u03c0/\u03a9p = w\u22a5 /v. Comparing this with Eq. 13 we obtain\nw\u22a5 p\n1 \u2212 \u03b12 .\nv\n\n(14)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n=\n\u22a5\nv\n| dw\nd\u03be |\n\n(15)\n\nR=\nUsing Eq. 11 this gives\nR=\n\nBecause g is a free parameter, v can be any positive number and therefore Eq. 15 implies that the radius of the helix\ncan be arbitrary.\nBecause the velocity of this travelling wave is unity, the spatial and temporal periodicities are equal. Therefore the\nperiod of rotation of the helix P \u2032 is equal to S in Eq. 13, in the dimensionless units that we are using. Therefore the\nrelationship between the period and the pitch is\n2\u03c0R\nP\u2032 = \u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(16)\n\nIn terms of our original units the period is\nP =\n\nC.\n\n2\u03c0R\u03bd\n\u221a\nfk 1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(17)\n\nTwo Dimensional Solutions\n\nWe now consider orbits in the x \u2212 z plane. This corresponds to a pendulum swinging around vertically through the\nbottom of the sphere. This is a standard introductory mechanics problem. Letting \u03b8 denote the angle with respect\nto the \u2212k\u0302 direction,\n\u03b8\u0308 = \u2212g sin \u03b8\n\n(18)\n\n\f6\nwhere the dots that normally represent a time derivative are really derivatives with respect to \u03be. Low energy solutions\nwhere the total energy E is less than g give \u03b8 oscillating between two bounds. In this case the curve for the\nmicrotubule will look sinusoidal. Beyond the separatrix where E > g, \u03b8 will increase without bound. This gives rise\nto microtubule conformations that look close to prolate cycloids. In other words, the microtubule forms a travelling\nwave that periodically loops backwards. This is shown in Fig. 1\n2.0\n\ny\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n7\n\n\u0001\n\n6\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n5\n\n\u0004\n\n4\n\n3\n\nz\n\n\u0005\n\n2\n\n\u0006\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1. A two dimensional travelling wave solution for a microtubule that looks close to a prolate cycloid but differs from it\nin functional form.\n\nSmall values of |\u03b1| correspond to low values of g/E. In this case, the particle spends almost equal times at all\npoints on the circle giving a small value of hwi = \u03b1. As g/E increases to 1, \u03b1 increases and the loops become tighter;\na situation that is very costly energetically. However this is not the only solution to these equations for a fixed value\nof \u03b1. If instead we consider solutions with E < g, then large g/E corresponds to small oscillations of w about \u2212k\u0302. In\nthis case, |\u03b1| is close to 1 and the curve has no tight loops. The shape of the microtubule is close to a sine wave.\nTo obtain the relationship between G \u2261 g/E and \u03b1 we use conservation of energy to obtain the period T ,\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n\np\n2E(1 + G cos \u03b8)\n\n(19)\n\nThe time average of w in the k\u0302 direction is\nR\u03c0\nhcos \u03b8i =\n\ncos \u03b8\nd\u03b8\n1+G cos \u03b8)\nR\u03c0\n\u221a 1\nd\u03b8\n0\n1+G cos \u03b8)\n0\n\n\u221a\n\n(20)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals as\nhcos \u03b8i =\n\nE(2G/(1 + G))\n1\n(1 \u2212 (1 + G)\n)\nG\nK(2G/(1 + G))\n\n(21)\n\nWhere E and K are the complete Elliptic integrals of the first and second kind respectively.

A plot of the value of \u03b1 as a function of 1/G.\n\nThe case of \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to the case of circular orbits discussed in Sec. II B. The cytoplasmic streaming\nvelocity is \u221d h (see Eq. 3). When h = 0, we have shown that the solutions are circular. If h is now made very small,\nwe expect that the solution will only be slightly perturbed from circular solutions. This corresponds to a small value\nof g/E. Therefore the value of G that is chosen for small enough h should correspond to the larger value of 1/G\nshown in Fig. 2. This corresponds to almost circular loops shifting slightly forward after every turn. As h increases\n\n\f8\nthe loops become tighter giving rise to a high elastic bending energy. At some point therefore, we expect a transition\nto another state. In fact, simulations discussed in Sec. III A show that near a flat surface, the microtubule transitions\nout of the plane to a helical shape at h \u2248 .385 for 128 links in a chain. For still larger h, the microtubule becomes\nflat again looking close to sinusoidal.\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FULL SOLUTIONS\n\nBy comparing the steady state solutions found above for large arclength s and time t, we will see that these solutions\nare physically realistic ones to consider. As we will see, the full equations of motions go to solutions of this type.\nHowever this is not a complete description of the problem, because of these solutions a particular one is selected\nfrom a whole family of solutions. The same behavior occurs in other problems in pattern selection such as dendritic\ngrowth [3, 4].\n\nA.\n\nComparison With Simulation\n\nEq. 1 was analyzed numerically using a method similar to that used earlier in the context of gel electrophoresis [5, 6].\nLink length drift was handled using a similar procedure to that implemented for chains with inertia [7] One end was\nconstrained to have coordinates at the origin, while the other was free.\nA Runge Kutta time step was 0.001, C = 20, fk = 2 and simulations were performed with N = 64 or N = 128\nlinks, as will be noted below.\nWe first consider the case of a microtubule with no wall or other external forces aside from the external velocity\nfield. As a function of the rescaled external velocity field h, the radius of curvature and period were calculated once the\nsystem had reached steady state. Using rescaled variables as defined by Eqs. 2 and 4 we can write the dimensionless\nradius of curvature as Rc\u2032 = Rc /\u03c10 , and the dimensionless period as P \u2032 = \u03c9P . The radius of curvature was calculated\nat the middle of the chain to reduce finite size effects. The results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The data for Rc , Fig.\n3 using 64 links, is very close to those of 128 links except for the highest h values. The data for the period, Fig. 4(a)\nshow good agreement for both chain sizes at all values of h studied.\nWe now test the analytic predictions that we made relating the period to the radius of the helix and \u03b1 given by\nEq. 16, and our conclusion that \u03b1 = h.

Therefore Eq. 16 gives\nP \u2032 = 2\u03c0Rc\u2032\n\np\n1 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n(23)\n\nWith this prediction and using the data for Rc in Fig. 3, we can independently calculate P \u2032 for 64 link chains. We\ncan only do this where finite size effects are not important and therefore omit the highest two h values from this\nanalysis. The data, Fig. 4(b), show excellent agreement to within the differences expected by finite size effects. This\ncorroborates our analytical analysis of steady state solutions.\nThe case of h = \u03b1 = 0 displayed in Fig. 3 can be written in terms of the original dimensional variables of Eq. 1\n\n\f18\n\n18\n\n17\n\n17\n\n16\n\n16\n\n15\n\n15\n\nP'\n\nP'\n\n10\n\n14\n\n13\n\n13\n\n12\n\n12\n\n11\n\n11\n\n10\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n10\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\nh\n\n(a)\nFIG. 4.\n\n14\n\n0.2\n\n(b)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nh\n\n(a)The rescaled period P \u2032 = P \u03c9 versus the rescaled velocity field h = \u03b1.

(b) The rescaled period P \u2032 = P \u03c9 versus the rescaled velocity field h = \u03b1 calculated\nby using Eq. 23 and data on the radius of the helix versus h shown in Fig. 3. The result is shown by the green triangles. The\nblue circles are the same data shown in Fig. 4 by directly measuring the period.\n\nusing Eq. 4\nRc = (C/(\u03b2fk ))1/3 .\n\n(24)\n\nFrom the numerical solution, this gives \u03b2 = 0.05 \u00b1 0.0005. This is useful in analyzing experimental data, as Rc is\nnearly constant for h < 0.7.\nNext we consider the presence of a wall. We introduced a force representing a wall in the y \u2212 z plane of the form\nfw =\n\nx2\n\u00ee\n(x + 1)2\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is only present for x < 0. The force is singular at x = \u22121 preventing the chain from crossing that plane. The\nperiod as a function of h is shown in Fig. 5 for C = 20 and chains with 128 links.\nFor small values of h, the period does not vary much. The shapes obtained are flat and appear to be the same as\nthose found in II C. However there is non-analytic behavior at h \u2248 0.385 corresponding to a transition to flattened\nhelical waves. Then at h \u2248 0.425 the solution becomes almost completely flat and showing waves that look closer to\nsine waves, corresponding to the flat sinusoidal-like solutions studied in II C.\nWe now consider the dependence of period and curvature on the length of chains L. Our analytical solutions have\nbeen in the limit that the chain length L \u2192 \u221e. For finite length chains, we expect corrections to this behavior. This\nis important to analyze in relationship to experiments using microtubule gliding assays [8]. In this case we consider\n\n\f11\n\n24\n\n22\n\n20\n\nP'\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\n10\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nh\n\nFIG. 5.

Fig. 6(a) shows the dependence\nof the radius of curvature measured halfway along the arclength, as a function of chain length. As usual, the rescaled\ndimensionless variables, see Eqs. 2 and 4 have been used. The curve shows a non-monotonic dependence on L that\nlevels off at L \u2248 20. Fig. 6(b) shows that the rescaled period is slightly non-monotonic as well but decreases to a\nconstant value at L \u2248 15. In comparison with gliding assays, we took [1] L = 14.0, where values of parameters are\nwithin 3% of their asymptotic values.\nNote that in Fig. 6(b) the period diverges for finite L \u2248 3. Below this point, the solution is a static straight line.\nThis is similar to the usual buckling transition for a finite length elastic rod. The microtubule needs to be sufficiently\nlong to undergo the dynamical instability analyzed here.\n\n\f12\n\n4.0\n\n50\n\n3.5\n\n45\n40\n\n3.0\n\nP\n\nR\n\n35\n2.5\n\n30\n2.0\n\n25\n20\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n0\n\n(a)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nL\n\n150\n\n40\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n(b)\n\n20\nL\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFIG. 6.

(b) The rescaled period versus the rescaled chain length in steady state for h = 0.\n\nB.\n\nSelection of Scale\n\nAs noted in section II A, there exists a continuous family of steady state solutions because if w(\u03be) is a solution,\nthen so is w(\u03bb\u03be) for arbitrary \u03bb. The general way that a particular value of \u03bb is selected is likely to be due to the\nsame mechanism as in other pattern formation problems [3, 4]. The travelling wave solutions ignore the boundary\nconditions at the ends s = 0 and s = L. Far from those ends, we have found a continuous family of solutions.\nHowever these solutions become invalid close to the ends. The travelling wave solutions are only valid in the limit of\n0 << s << L. The full solution must match to one of these travelling solutions in that region but will differ greatly\nnear the ends.\nAs an example, consider the circular solutions of Sec. II B with h = \u03b1 = vs = 0. There the steady state solution is\na rotating circle wrapped around on itself of arbitrary radius R. However near the end s = 0, the solutions goes into\nthe circle's center. Similarly it deviates from a circle at s = L. In analogy with other pattern growth problems such\nas the \"Geometric Model\" [3], where the mathematics have been analyzed in detail, we expect that the boundary\nconditions imposed on the ends, will only be satisfied for certain values of R. If there is more than one allowed value\nof R, the value picked out will be the most stable of these. In the Geometric Model the form of the equations is\nmuch simpler, making it possible to understand the overall structure of the problem more easily. In the present case,\na precise understanding of the numerical results will be the subject of future research.\n\n\f13\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have analyzed a model that describes a microtubule tethered at its minus end and subject to viscous drag and\nforces due to kinesin walking toward the plus end. The walkers provide a force tangent to the local direction of the\nmicrotubule and cause an instability that causes nonlinear waves to travel along its arclength. The scale of the wave\ncan be arbitrary. An open question now is to find an analytic model that predicts the precise scale that is selected.\nThere are many other questions that are interesting. What is the motion when there are obstacles that prevent free\nmotion of the microtubule? Do these lead to chaotic behavior? What happens in the case of many microtubules\ninteracting through steric and hydrodynamic interactions? This last question is difficult to answer and will be tied\ninto the question of large scale collective motion of forests of microtubules and the velocity flows that they produce.\nVelocity flows giving rise to micro-mixing have been studied in related systems [9\u201312] and it would be very interesting\nto understand the large scale cytoplasmic motion for Drosophila oocytes.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank Ian Carbone, and Bill Sullivan for useful discussions.
