Polosa\u2020\nLAPTH, 9, Chemin de Bellevue, BP 110, 74941 Annecy-le-Vieux Cedex, France\n(Dated: November 21, 2018)\nWe calculate the cross section for \u03b7b production at the Tevatron at next-to-leading order in the\nstrong coupling and find that more than two millions of \u03b7b 's are expected per inverse picobarn of\nintegrated luminosity. We discuss the decay modes into charmed states and suggest that the decays\ninto D\u2217 D(\u2217) mesons might be the most promising channels to observe the \u03b7b in Run II.\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Bx,13.25.Gv\n\nConsidering the rich phenomenology of the \u03a5\nstates, it is quite surprising that spin singlet bb\u0304\nstates, including the 1 S0 ground state, have not been\nobserved yet.\nFine and hyperfine splittings of the quarkonia spectra were calculated using phenomenological\nmodels for the heavy-quark potential [1, 2]. Recent\nprogress both in lattice and in perturbative QCD\nhas allowed the achievement of comparable precisions [3, 4]. Various approaches have been successfully adopted to describe the charmonium system\nand are believed to be even more reliable for the\nheavier bb\u0304 states, where relativistic effects are less\nimportant. Recent determinations lead to a mass\nsplitting between the \u03a5(1S) and the \u03b7b (1S) in the\n40\u201360 MeV range [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].\nSearches of the \u03b7b have been pursued in various\nexperiments. In e\u2212 e+ collisions, cross sections for\nproducing spin singlet states are generally small and\nthe signal is rate-limited. This is compensated by a\nclean environment, which allows for searches in the\ninclusive decay modes. Following an original suggestion by Godfrey and Rosner [8], the CLEO collaboration has looked for the \u03b7b in the hindered M1 decay\nof the \u03a5(3S) and found no signal [9]. At LEP II, the\nALEPH collaboration analysed the \u03b3\u03b3 interactions\ndata, basing their analysis on the QCD prediction\nof \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 partial width [10]: no evidence was found in\nthe four- and six-charged-particle decay modes [11].\nThe situation is exactly reversed in hadron collisions, where the production rates can be large, with\nmillions of events produced at the Tevatron per inverse picobarn of integrated luminosity, yet the intense hadronic activity makes any inclusive analysis\nunfeasible. In this case it is necessary to identify\ndecay modes that have triggerable signatures and\nallow for full invariant mass reconstruction of the decaying state. Such exclusive modes are believed to\nhave very small branching ratios. Braaten et al. [12]\n\nhave suggested that the \u03b7b at the Tevatron could be\nobserved via its decay into J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8, with the subsequent leptonic decay of the J/\u03c8's; experimental\nefforts have started in this direction [13]. This signature exploits the upgraded abilities of the CDF\ndetector of triggering on soft muons.\nThe purpose of this note is twofold. First, we\nprovide the prediction for the inclusive cross section of \u03b7b production at the Tevatron, based on the\n(NR)QCD calculation at the next-to-leading accuracy in the strong coupling [14]. We find that the\ncross section is about four times larger than the\nprevious available estimate [12]. Second, stemming\nfrom an estimate of the corresponding branching ratio, we suggest a new analysis based on the decay\nof the \u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D(\u2217) meson pairs. Thanks to secondary vertex trigger capabilities of CDF and to the\nhigh resolution achievable in the invariant mass reconstruction (\u223c 20 MeV), this could turn out to be\nthe most promising search channel at the Tevatron.\nAccording to the NRQCD factorization approach [15], the inclusive cross section for the \u03b7b in\npp\u0304 collisions can be written as:\n\u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 \u03b7b + X) =\nXZ\ndx1 dx2 fi/p fj/p\u0304 \u03c3\u0302(ij \u2192 \u03b7b ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\ni,j\n\nwhere\n\u03c3\u0302(ij \u2192 \u03b7b ) =\n\nCnij h0|On\u03b7b |0i .\n\nn\n\nThe short-distance coefficients Cnij , calculable in perturbative QCD, describe the production of a quark\u2013\nantiquark pair state with quantum number n, while\nthe h0|On\u03b7b |0i are the non-perturbative matrix elements that describe the subsequent hadronization of\nthe bb\u0304 pair into the physical \u03b7b state.

Hence, given that the nonperturbative matrix elements for the singlet production are extracted from \u03a5 decays, there are no unknown parameters (up to corrections of O(v 4 )) entering the estimate for \u03b7b production.\nThe leading-order cross section for gg \u2192 \u03b7b ,\nFig. 1(a), is\n\u03c3\u0302(gg \u2192 \u03b7b ) =\n\n4m2b\n\u03c0 3 \u03b12S\n\u03b4(1 \u2212\n)h0|O1\u03b7b (1 S0 )|0i. (3)\n3\n36mb \u015d\n\u015d\n\nNext-to-leading order corrections in the strong coupling have been calculated in Refs. [14, 16]. These\ninclude virtual corrections to the 2 \u2192 1 process,\nFig. 1(b), and real 2 \u2192 2 processes, such as gg \u2192\n\u03b7b g, gq \u2192 \u03b7b q, Fig. 1(c). The result for the total\ncross section in pp\u0304 collisions at 1.96 TeV of centerof-mass energy is\n\u03c3(pp\u0304 \u2192 \u03b7b + X) = 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcb ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have adopted CTEQ5M1 parton densities,\nthe corresponding two-loop evolution for \u03b1S (\u03bcR )\nand mb = 4.75 GeV. The quoted uncertainty has\nbeen estimated by summing (in quadrature) the errors coming from various sources. The first is associated to the choice of the renormalization and\nfactorization scales. Varying them independently in\nthe range mb < \u03bcR , \u03bcF < 4mb gives an uncertainty\nof 10%. For the non-perturbative matrix element we\nhave used the determination from \u03a5 leptonic decay,\nh\u03a5|O1 (3 S1 )|\u03a5i = 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 GeV3 , which can be related to the \u03b7b production matrix element by using\nspin-symmetry and vacuum saturation approximation, h0|O1\u03b7b (1 S0 )|0i = h\u03a5|O1 (3 S1 )|\u03a5i, up to O(v 4 )\ncorrections. Other determinations coming from potential models [17] and lattice calculations [18] fall\n\nin the range of the quoted error. Finally, we also\nincluded the effect of an uncertainty on the bottom\n(pole) mass of \u00b150 MeV on the cross section. The\nstrong correlation to the non-perturbative matrix element extraction has been exploited to reduce the\nuncertainty from this source. The result, quoted\nin Eq. (4), accounts for the \"direct\" contribution\nand does not include feed-downs from higher-mass\nstates, such as the hb .\nFor the experimental analysis it is important to\nknow the distribution of \u03b7b at small pT values.\nThis cannot be described accurately by a fixed-order\ncalculation. In this region of the phase space it\nis necessary to resum higher-order corrections involving soft-gluon radiation. To this aim, we use\nPYTHIA [19], matched with the exact matrix elements for ij \u2192 \u03b7b k describing the high-pT tail,\nas outlined in Ref. [20]. This procedure, which has\nbeen shown to work well for the analogous process\ngg \u2192 H, has the additional virtue that it can be\ndirectly used for simulation in experiments. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 2, where the differential\ndistribution in pT for the \u03b7b is shown (upper curve).\nHadronization and initial kT effects are not included.\nThe normalization of the inclusive \u03b7b distributions is\nobtained from the NLO result, Eq. (4).\nAs already stated above, the cross section for the\n\u03b7b in the central region is about four times larger\nthan was estimated in Ref. [12] by rescaling the \u03a5\ncross section at high transverse momentum. This\nprocedure is expected to provide an underestimate,\nsince it assumes that the pT spectra for \u03a5 and \u03b7b\nhave a similar shape at small pT . In fact \u03a5 colorsinglet production proceeds at LO through gg \u2192 \u03a5g\nand therefore vanishes at pT \u223c 0, where the largest\npart of the \u03b7b 's are produced.\nWith such a large number of events expected, it is\ninteresting to consider in detail the rare exclusive decays that might give triggerable signatures. It is easy\nto show that direct decays into photons or lepton\npairs give either too small branching ratios or very\ndifficult experimental signatures (such as \u03b7b \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nwhose branching ratio is O(10\u22125 )). In Ref. [12], the\nbranching ratio Br(\u03b7b \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8) was estimated\nthrough scaling from the analogous \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, finding\na value compatible with 7 \u00d7 10\u22124\u00b11 . This is probably an overestimate. As a simple upper bound, let\nus consider the inclusive decay rate of the \u03b7b into\nfour-charm states\n\u0393(\u03b7b \u2192 J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8) < \u0393(\u03b7b \u2192 cc\u0304cc\u0304).\n\n(5)\n\nThe inclusive rate can be calculated at leading order\nby considering the four Feynman diagrams, such as\n\n\f3\n\nc\nc\u0304\n\n\u03b7b\n\nc\nc\u0304\nc\n\n\u03b7b\n\ng\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nc\u0304\n\nFIG. 3: Representative Feynman diagrams for the \u03b7b\ninclusive decay into (a) two-charm (two diagrams) and\n(b) four-charm (four diagrams) states.\n\nFIG. 2: Differential cross sections for \u03b7b production at\nthe Tevatron (pp\u0304 at 1.96 TeV). The upper curve is normalized to the NLO total rate and describes the pT distribution for the \u03b7b . The lower curve is the corresponding distribution for the D mesons coming from the \u03b7b\ndecays, after requiring that they both have |\u03b7(D)| < 1\n(no branching ratio included). After the acceptance cut,\nthe rate drops to 15% of the total cross section.\n\nthe one shown in Fig. 3(b). The result is\n\u22125\nBr(\u03b7b \u2192 cc\u0304cc\u0304) = 1.8+2.3\n.\n\u22120.8 \u00d7 10\n\n(6)\n\nwhere mc = 1.45 GeV, mb = 4.75 GeV, \u03b1S (2mb ) =\n0.182 and the NLO expression for the inclusive total width [14, 21] have been used. The amplitudes\nhave been calculated analytically while the integration over the phase space has been performed numerically. The uncertainty has been estimated by varying the renormalization scale between mb < \u03bcR <\n4mb and the masses in the \u00b150 MeV range. The\nfour-charm branching ratio is very sensitive to the\nvalue of the charm mass, which dominates its uncertainty. The above result shows that the inclusive\nrate is already smaller than the lower bound obtained in Ref. [12]; further suppression is expected\nmainly because many other decay modes to charmed\nmesons (or other charmonium states) should contribute to the saturation of the inclusive rate.\nGiven the result in Eq. (6), a comment on the reliability of the estimate based on the scaling from\nBr(\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) is in order. To this aim we recall\nthat the decay of a scalar QQ\u0304 meson into two vector states is suppressed in perturbative QCD [22].\nA non-trivial check of this selection rule is that\nthe branching ratio Br(\u03b7b \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8) is exactly\nzero when calculated at LO in the NRQCD double expansion in \u03b1S and v 2 . For the same reason\none would expect the rate of \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 to be sup-\n\npressed, in contradiction with the measured value\nof about 1%. This entails that some other (nonperturbative) mechanism is responsible for this decay process [23]. Rescaling by (mc /mb )4 the branching ratio of \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 to obtain the branching ratio\nof \u03b7b \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8 amounts to rescaling by the same\nfactor also the effect of non-perturbative or higherorder contributions that are likely to be crucial in\ndetermining the \u03b7c decay, but less and less important as we pass from the \u03b7c to the \u03b7b system.\nFrom the phenomenological point of view, Eq. (6)\nimplies Br(\u03b7b \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ) < 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 , which\nmakes a search in this channel very hard. As an\nalternative, we propose to consider the decays into\ncharmed mesons, \u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D(\u2217) [28].\nA computation of the exclusive decay rates is\nmissing and does not seem to be feasible within\nthe framework of quark models or QCD sum rules.\nProbably, there is room to face such a problem using\nlattice techniques. Here we assume that the exclusive decays into D\u2217 D(\u2217) dominate the inclusive rate\ninto charm:\n\u0393(\u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D(\u2217) ) . \u0393(\u03b7b \u2192 cc\u0304 + X).\n\n(7)\n\nWe find that the largest contribution to the decay of\nthe \u03b7b into charmed states is given, Fig. 3(a), by\nBr(\u03b7b \u2192 cc\u0304g) = 1.5+0.8\n\u22120.4 % ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere we used the same input parameters and estimated the uncertainties as in the decay into the\nfour-charm states. It can now be argued that not\nmuch suppression is expected in passing from the\ninclusive to the exclusive decays. For example,\ndecay rates into charmonium states should be of\nthe same size \u03a5 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X, i.e., O(10\u22123 ) [24].\nEmission of extra pions should also be considered,\nbut some of these contributions would be automatically included in the experimental analysis, e.g.,\n\u03b7b \u2192 DD\u2217 \u2192 DD\u03c0, as non-resonant diagrams.\nHowever, to be conservative, we consider the range\n10\u22123 < Br(\u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D(\u2217) ) < 10\u22122 in the following\nphenomenological analysis.\n\n\f4\nThere are other decay modes leading to a twocharm final state that have not been included in our\nestimate of the branching ratio. One is the decay of\n\u03b7b \u2192 g \u2217 g \u2217 \u2192 cc\u0304 through a (box) loop, which proceeds at order \u03b14S and is further suppressed by loop\nfactors. Another is the decay \u03b7b \u2192 g \u2217 \u2192 cc\u0304, via\n[8]\na 3 S1 state, which is only, \u03b12S but it is suppressed\nby the color octet matrix element h\u03b7b |O8 (3 S1 )|\u03b7b i.\nAssuming a scaling O(v 4 ) for the non-perturbative\nmatrix element, this process gives a non-negligible\ncontribution to the branching ratio, about 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nHowever, this result is affected by a large uncertainty and could be much smaller as suggested by\nstudies [25, 26] about the size of color octect matrix\nelements in \u03a5 decays.\nResults for the pT distribution of the D mesons\nfrom the \u03b7b decay are shown in Fig. 2 (lower curve).\nNo branching ratio is included, the difference in\nrate coming only from the requirement that both\nD mesons be central, |\u03b7(D)| < 1. As expected, the\npT distribution peaks just below M\u03b7b /2. The efficiency for the geometrical acceptance of the detector\nis found to be about 15%. By adding the requirement that at least one D meson has pT > 5 GeV, one\nis left with only 4% of the total number of events produced. The above efficiency can be folded with our\nestimate of the branching ratio leading to 104 \u2212 105\nD\u2217 D(\u2217) triggerable events expected from the \u03b7b decay in 100 pb\u22121 of integrated luminosity at the Tevatron. The final number of reconstructed events will\ndepend on the decay modes of the D and D\u2217 mesons\nand on the associated experimental efficiencies. We\nleave this to more detailed experimental studies and\nonly add a few comments. First we note that, according to the arguments outlined above, perturbative QCD predicts the \u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D\u2217 decay to have\na smaller rate with respect to \u03b7b \u2192 D\u2217 D. In this\ncase, it is reasonable to expect that different charge\nassignments, such as D\u22170 D0 , D\u2217+ D\u2212 , D\u2217\u2212 D+ , will\noccur with the same probability of 13 . Finally, we recall that the cleanest signatures have small branching ratios, Br(D0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = 3.90% and Br(D+ \u2192\n0\nK \u03c0 + ) = 2.77% [24], leading to a factor of about\n10\u22123 drop in the rate if both D mesons are required\nto decay through these channels. We foresee that\nsizeable improvements could be achieved by requiring that just one of two D mesons decays through a\nvery clean signature, providing an efficient trigger.\nTo summarize, we have presented the NLO QCD,\nprediction for \u03b7b production at the Tevatron, including a resummed result for the pT spectrum obtained\nwith a dedicated implementation in PYTHIA. The\nproduction rate is large, of the order of a few \u03bcb,\nand allows for the search of the \u03b7b through rare ex-\n\nclusive decays. We argued that the branching ratio\ninto J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 is probably too small and we suggested\nto look for the \u03b7b through its decay into D\u2217 D(\u2217)\nmesons. Our results indicate that the \u03b7b could be\neventually observed during Run II at the Tevatron.\nWe have greatly benefited from conversations with\nM. Campanelli. We are grateful to T.
