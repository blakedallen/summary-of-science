We construct the CJT effective potential and the gap equation for general\nvalues of the noncommutative parameter \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd .

We argue that our result, is consistent with previous studies suggesting that a\nuniform ordered phase would be inconsistent with the infrared structure of canonical noncommutative\ntheories.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum field theories on canonical-noncommutative spacetime have been introduced in [1, 2]. Since\nthen, noncommutative field theories have been extensively studied in literature (for a review see [3, 4])\nespecially for their connection with string theory [5, 6, 7]. A key feature of canonical noncommutative\ntheories is the so-called IR/UV mixing which connects the high-energy degrees of freedom of the theory\nwith the low-energy degrees of freedom [8, 10, 9]. IR/UV mixing is a direct consequence of the nonvanishing commutations relation. Besides having strong implication for the phenomenological predictions\n(see e.g. [11, 12, 13]), IR/UV mixing renders the renormalizability and the infrared structure of noncommutative field theories highly non-trivial (and interconnected) issues, even in the case of massive\ntheories. Despite these mentioned infrared problems, in the \u03bb\u03c64 -theory case, one-loop renormalization\nwas explicitly carried out in [8]. In [14, 15] two-loop renormalization was obtained, and in [16], using the\nPolchinski method [17], renormalization was claimed to all orders of the perturbative expansion. The\nPolchinski method was also adopted in the discussion of the renormalizability of the O(N )-symmetric\nscalar theory reported in [18], where it was also argued that in order to achieve renormalizability of the\nordered phase it would be necessary to relax the hypothesis of translational invariance of the vacuum.\nThe idea that noncommutative scalar theory exhibits a transition to a non-uniform phase was first considered in some detail in [19] where, for the ordered phase, a \"stripe phase\" was proposed. Recently\nnumerical studies provided support for this hypothesis in lower dimensional cases [20, 21, 22]. Problems\nwith the renormalization in the translationally invariant ordered phase where also encountered in [23, 24]\nand [25] (however also see [26, 27]).\nIn this paper we want to investigate these issues pertaining to the translationally invariant vacuum\nby means of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism [28]. This formalism has proven to be a\npowerful non-perturbative approach for the study of phase transitions in QFT in commutative spacetime\n[28, 29], especially in those theories exhibiting severe infrared problems such as thermal field theories (see\ne.g. [29, 30, 31]). It is therefore natural to consider the application of the CJT formalism to canonical\nnoncommutative field theories, where severe infrared problems, as mentioned, are present. We consider\nthe scalar-\u03bb\u03c64 theory case. We construct the CJT effective potential and the gap equation for general\nvalues of the noncommutative parameter \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd . We observe that under the hypothesis of translational\ninvariance, which is assumed in the effective potential construction, differently from the commutative\ncase (\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd = 0), the renormalizability of the gap equation is incompatible with the renormalizability of\nthe effective potential. We argue that our result, is consistent with previous studies suggesting that a\nuniform ordered phase would be inconsistent with the infrared structure of canonical noncommutative\ntheories.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section-2 we review the CJT formalism in the commutative\nscalar \u03bb\u03c64 theory also discussing the bubble approximation. In Section-3 we apply CJT formalism to the\nnoncommutative scalar \u03bb\u03c64 theory. In Section-4 we calculate the gap equation and the effective potential\nand discuss their renormalizability. Then, in Section-5, we report our conclusions.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCJT formalism in commutative spacetime\n\nIn this section we briefly review the CJT formalism for the scalar-\u03bb\u03c64 theory1 the commutative case\n[28, 29]. The starting point is the definition of the partition function\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n4\n4\n4\nZ[J, K] = exp W [J, K] = D\u03c6 exp S (\u03c6) + dx J(x)\u03c6(x) +\ndy dx \u03c6(x)K(x, y)\u03c6(y) ,\n2\nin which two sources J(x) and K(x, y) are introduced.\nOne defines also \u03c6(x) and G(x, y) by the relations\n\u03b4W [J, K]\n= \u03c6(x),\n\u03b4J(x)\n1\n\u03b4W [J, K]\n= {\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y) + G(x, y)} .\n\u03b4K(x, y)\n2\nThen one performs a Legendre transform of W [J, K]:\nZ\nZ\n1\n4\n\u0393[\u03c6(x), G(x, y)] = W [J(x), K(x, y)] \u2212 dx \u03c6(x)J(x) \u2212\ndx4 dy 4 \u03c6(x)K(x, y)\u03c6(y)+\n2\nZ\n1\n\u2212\ndx4 dy 4 G(x, y)K(x, y),\n2\nwhich satisfies the relations\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nZ\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n= \u2212J(x) \u2212 dy 4 K(x, y)\u03c6(y),\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\n1\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n= \u2212 K(x, y).\n\u03b4G(x, y)\n2\n\nThe conditions for vanishing sources K(x, y) = 0 and J(x) = 0 (the physical point), corresponds to\nchoices of \u03c6(x) and G(x, y) such that they are solutions of the stationarity equations:\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n= 0,\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03c6, G]\n= 0.\n\u03b4G(x, y)\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nFrom (1) and (2) we see that, at the physical point, \u03c6(x) is the vacuum-expectation-value of \u03c6, while\nG(x, y) is the expectation value of the connected part of the two point function:\n\u03c6(x)|J=K=0 = h0|\u03c6(x)|0i,\nG(x, y)|J=K=0 = h0|\u03c6(x)\u03c6(y)|0i \u2212 h0|\u03c6(x)|0ih0|\u03c6(y)|0i.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nIt can be shown [28] that \u0393[\u03c6, G] so defined is the generating functional for the two-particle irreducible(2PI) Green's functions, with propagator given by G(x, y) and vertices given by Sint (\u03c6; \u03c6), where\nSint (\u03c6; \u03c6) is obtained from S(\u03c6) by retaining only cubic and higher \u03c6-terms in the expression of S(\u03c6 + \u03c6).\nOne can expand (3) to obtain\n\n1\n\n1\n1 \b\n\u0393(\u03c6, G) = S(\u03c6) \u2212 T rLnD0\u22121G + T r D \u22121 G \u2212 1 + \u03932 (\u03c6, G),\n2\n2\n\nIn this section, as well as in the rest of the paper, we will work in euclidean spacetime.\n\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere\nD \u22121 (x, y) =\n\n\u03b42 S\n,\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\u03b4\u03c6(y)\n\nD0\u22121 (x, y) = D \u22121 |\u03bb=0 ,\nand \u03932 (\u03c6, G) is the sum of the 2PI-vacuum diagrams with vertices given by Sint (\u03c6; \u03c6) and propagators\ngiven by G(x, y) (see Fig.1).\n\nFigure 1: 2PI vacuum diagrams contributing to \u03932 (\u03c6, G) up to the three loop level.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 2: Examples of bubble diagrams.\nUsing (8) the gap equation (5) may be rewritten in the form\nG\u22121 (x, y) = D \u22121 (x, y) + 2\n\n\u03b4\u03932 (\u03c6, G)\n.\n\u03b4G(x, y)\n\n(9)\n\nOne can also recover the usual 1PI-effective action \u0393(\u03c6) simply evaluating \u0393[\u03c6, G] at nonvanishing J(x)\nbut at vanishing K(x, y):\n\u03931P I (\u03c6) = \u0393[\u03c6, G0 ],\n(10)\nwhere G0 is solution of the gap equation (5).\nAs usual, if one is interested in the vacuum state of the theory (and the vacuum state preserves\ntranslational invariance), it is possible to adopt, in place of the effective action (10), the simpler effective\npotential V (\u03c6) defined by\nZ\n\u0393[\u03c6, G0 ] \u2261 \u2212\n\n3\n\ndx4 V (\u03c6).\n\n(11)\n\n\fThis CJT formalism which at first sight might appear more involved than the standard formalism, with\nonly the source J coupled to the field, turns out to be very useful in the so-called bubble resummation,\nwhich takes into account all the vacuum to vacuum diagrams of the type of Fig.2. In the CJT formalism\none obtains the whole bubble resummation [28] simply considering the \"eight\"-diagram (A in Fig.1)\ncontribution to \u03932 (\u03c6, G). We will use this approximation, also known as Hartree-Fock approximation, in\nthe following sections.\n\n3\n\nCJT formalism in noncommutative field theories\n\nHaving outlined the basic features of the CJT formalism we can proceed to apply it to the noncommutative\n\u03bb\u03c64 scalar theory. We recall [8] that the action is given by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\n\u03bb\n4 1 2 2\n\u03bc\nS = dx\nm \u03c6 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03c6 + \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 ,\n(12)\n2\n2\n4!\nwhere \u22c6 represents the Moyal product:\ni\n\n\u03c61 (x) \u22c6 \u03c62 (x) = \u03c61 (x)e 2 \u03b8\n\n\u2192\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2190\n\u2202\u03bc\u2202\u03bd\n\n\u03c62 (x),\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd coordinate-independent antisymmetric matrix.\nIn terms od the Moyal \u22c6-product (13) the quadratic part of the action remains unaffected by noncommutativity, while a \u03b8-dependence arises for the interaction term. No specific assumptions are made\nin the CJT formalism about the form of the interaction therefore procedure outlined in Section-2 (and\nin particular Eq.(8)) is still valid in this noncommutative context.\nIt is easily seen that in the case under consideration:\n\u03b42 S\n=\n(14)\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\u03b4\u03c6(y)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bb\b 4\n= \u2212 \u0003 + m2 x \u03b44 (x \u2212 y) \u2212\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 y) \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 + \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03b44 (x \u2212 y) \u22c6 \u03c6 + \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03b44 (x \u2212 y) ,\n3!\n\u0002\n\u0003\nD0\u22121 (x, y) = D \u22121 |\u03bb=0 = \u2212 \u0003 + m2 x \u03b44 (x \u2212 y).\n(15)\n\nD \u22121 (x, y) =\n\nAs expected D0\u22121 (x, y) is not modified by noncommutativity since the integrals of terms quadratic\nin the fields are not modified by the \u22c6-product (13), while D \u22121 (x, y) acquires the \u03b8-dependence. The\n\u22c6-products which appear in (14) can be easily calculated in momentum space.\nNext let us consider the Sint action. One can proceed in two steps. The first step is the translation of\nthe action S(\u03c6) \u2192 S(\u03c6 + \u03c6). The second step is the one of retaining from the shifted action only cubic,\nand higher, terms in \u03c6. So doing one obtains\nZ\nZ\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nSint (\u03c6; \u03c6) =\ndx4 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 +\ndx4 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6,\n4!\n6\nwhere the cyclicity of the \u22c6-product (13) under integration has been used.\nTo proceed further we now need to adopt an ansatz for the form of G(x, y). Since we intend to obtain\nthe CJT effective potential we must assume translational invariance, so that the more general ansatz we\ncan consider takes the form\nZ\nd\u03b14 exp i\u03b1(x \u2212 y)\nG(x, y) = G(x \u2212 y) =\n(16)\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b12 + M 2 (\u03b1)\n4\n\n\fwhere M 2 (\u03b1) is to be determined. Once the ansatz (16) has been done we can calculate the various terms\nin the left-hand-side of (8). The result is\nZ\nZ\n\b\n1\n\u03bb\n4\n2\n2 2\n\u0393(\u03c6, G) =\ndx (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6) + m \u03c6 +\ndx4 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6+\n(17)\n2\n4!\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\np2 + M 2 (p)\ndp4\n1\nln\n+\ndx4\n+\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\np 2 + m2\n\u03bb R dp41 dp42\n2\n2\nZ\nZ\ne 1 )\u03c6(p\ne 2)\n4 m \u2212 M (k) +\n8 F (p1 , p2 , k) exp ix(p1 + p2 )\u03c6(p\n1\ndk\n3!

F (p1 , p2 , k), using the notation pi \u03b8pj \u2261 p\u03bci \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd p\u03bdj , takes the\nform\ni\nF (p1 , p2 , k) = exp \u2212 (p1 \u03b8p2 + k\u03b8p1 + k\u03b8p2 ) +\n2\ni\n+ exp \u2212 (p1 \u03b8k + p1 \u03b8p2 + k\u03b8p2 ) +\n2\ni\n+ exp \u2212 (p1 \u03b8p2 + p1 \u03b8k + p2 \u03b8k) .\n2\n\n(18)\n\n\b\nThe first row in (17) is just S(\u03c6), the second row is T r ln(D0\u22121 G), the third is T r D \u22121 G \u2212 1 .\nNow we must evaluate \u03932 (\u03c6, G) with vertices given by Sint (\u03c6; \u03c6) and propagator given by G(x, y).\nAs a first application of the formalism one can recover the usual one-loop 1PI effective action [8] simply\nsetting \u03932 = 0. In this case the gap equation (9) trivially reduces to\nG\u22121 (x, y) = D \u22121 (x, y),\n\n(19)\n\nand (8) becomes\n\n1\n\u0393(\u03c6) = S(\u03c6) + T r ln D \u22121 (\u03c6)D0 .\n2\nThat is just the one-loop 1PI effective action.\nWhile neglecting \u03932 completely gives us back the one-loop 1PI effective action, a more interesting\nresult is obtained by approximating \u03932 (\u03c6, G) including only the \"eight\" diagram (A in Fig.1). In this\napproximation one has that\n\u001a\nZ\n\u2032 \u001b\n1\nd\u03b14 d\u03b1\u20324\n1\n1 4\n2\n2 \u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\n) .\n(20)\n\u0393 (\u03c6, G) = \u03bb\u03b4 (0)\n1 + 2 cos (\n4!\n(2\u03c0)8 \u03b12 + M 2 (\u03b1) \u03b1\u20322 + M 2 (\u03b1\u2032 )\n2\n\nWe observe that differently from the commutative case, where the momenta circulating in each of the\ntwo loops do not mix (so that \u03932 is evaluated as the products of two single-variable integrals), in the\ncommutative case this mixing occurs.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nThe CJT effective potential in noncommutative field theories\n\nFrom the effective action (17) and (20), assuming translational invariance of the candidate vacua \u03c6(x) =\n\u03c6, one can extract the effective potential (11):\n\u03bb\n1\nV (\u03c6) = m2 \u03c62 + \u03c64 +\n2\n4! \u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\np2 + M 2 (p)\ndp4\n+\nln\n+\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\np 2 + m2\n\u03bb 2\n2\n2\nZ\n1\ndk 4 m \u2212 M (k) + 2 \u03c6\n+\n+\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\nk2 + M 2 (k)\nZ\n\b\n1\nd\u03b14 d\u03b1\u20324\n1\n1\n2 + cos(\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u2032 ) .\n+ \u03bb\n4!\n(2\u03c0)8 \u03b12 + M 2 (\u03b1) \u03b1\u20322 + M 2 (\u03b1\u2032 )\nThe stationarity condition (5) in this case becomes\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nM (\u03b1) \u2212 m \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212\n2\n6\n2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2202V (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(21)\n\n= 0 which implies the gap equation\n\ndb4 2 + cos (b\u03b8\u03b1)\n= 0.\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 (b)\n\n(22)\n\nSubstituting equation (22) in the expression of the potential (21) we obtain\n\u001a 2\n\u001b\nZ\np + M 2 (p)\n1 2 2 \u03bb 4 1\ndp4\nV (\u03c6, G) = m \u03c6 + \u03c6 +\nln\n+\n2\n4!\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\np 2 + m2\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\ndk4\ndb4\n\u03bb\n{2 + cos (b\u03b8k)} .\n\u2212\n4\n2\n2\n24\n(2\u03c0) k + M (k)\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 (b)\n\n(23)\n\nThe term in the second row of the above expression is generated by the bubble summation. The terms\nappearing in the first row are already present at one-loop level but what is different here is that they now\nmust be evaluated for M 2 (p) solution of the gap equation (22) which involves a non-trivial \u03b8-dependence.\nClearly our CJT resummed effective potential has complicated \u03b8-dependence whereas the 1-loop effective\npotential is completely \u03b8-independent. We notice that \u03b8-dependence manifests in two different ways:\nthe tree-level and the one-loop like contributions depend on \u03b8 only through M 2 (p) whereas the term\ngenerated by the bubble summation (the last one in (23)) also exhibits an explicit \u03b8-dependence.\nBoth (22) and (23) are ultraviolet divergent and they both are considered to be regularized with a\ncutoff \u039b on the loop-momenta. In the next section we will deal with the problem of their renormalization\nbut first we recall the strategy of renormalization adopted in the commutative case (\u03b8 = 0).\n\n4.1\n\nRenormalization of the effective potential for \u03b8 = 0\n\nIn the commutative case (22) and (23) become respectively\nZ\n\u03bb 2 \u03bb\ndb4\n1\n2\n2\nM (\u03b1) = m + \u03c6 +\n4\n2\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) b + M 2 (b)\n\n(24)\n\nand\n1\n\u03bb\n1\nV (\u03c6, G) = m2 \u03c62 + \u03c64 +\n2\n4!\n2\n\nZ\n\ndp4\nln\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n\u001a\n\np2 + M 2 (p)\np 2 + m2\n\n6\n\n\u001b\n\n\u03bb\n\u2212\n8\n\nZ\n\n1\ndk 4\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0) k + M 2 (k)\n\nZ\n\n1\ndb4\n.\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0) b + M 2 (b)\n(25)\n\n\fWe immediately see, from Eq.(24), that in this case M 2 (\u03b1) does not depend on the loop-momentum\n\u03b1 so that one can set M 2 (\u03b1) \u2261 M 2 both in (24) and in (25).\nRenormalization of the effective potential for \u03b8 = 0 is a well-known result (see e.g. [30]). We recall\nthe procedure that one can use to renormalize (24) and (25) since we will use it widely in the rest of the\npaper. In order to renormalize this gap equation (24) it is convenient to introduce I1 , I2 , GR through the\nformula\nZ\ndb4\n1\n= I1 \u2212 I2 M 2 + GR (M ),\n(26)\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0) b + M 2\nwhere\nZ\ndb4 1\nI1 =\n,\n(27)\n(2\u03c0)4 b2\nZ\ndb4 1\n,\n(28)\nI2 =\n(2\u03c0)4 b4\nand GR (M ) is the finite part of G(M ). The gap equation can then be rewritten in the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1 1\nm2 1\n2\n+ I2 =\n+ I1 + \u03c62 + GR (M ).\nM\n\u03bb 2\n\u03bb\n2\n2\n3\n\n(29)\n\nIntroducing the renormalized parameters\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1\n1\n= lim\n+ I1 ,\n\u03bbR \u039b\u2192\u221e \u03bb 2\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nm2R\nm\n1\n= lim\n+ I2 ,\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n\u03bbR\n\u03bb\n2\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\none gets the renormalized gap equation\n\u03bbR 2 \u03bbR\n\u03c6 +\nGR (M ).\n2\n3\nNext one verifies that the conditions (30) and (31) also renormalize the effective potential. For this\nobjective one observes that using (24) one can write (25) as the sum of three contributions\nM 2 = m2R +\n\n1\n\u03bb\nV 0 = m2 \u03c62 + \u03c64 ,\n2\n4!\nZ\n4\n1\n1\ndk\nVI =\nln(k2 ) + I1 M 2 \u2212\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n1 4\n1 4\n1\nM \u2212\nm \u2212\nV II = \u2212 GM 2 +\n2\n2\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\n(32)\n1\nI2 M 4 + T (M )\n4\n1 2 2 \u03bb 4\nm \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 ,\n2\n8\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nthat gives\n\n\u03bb 4 1 M4 1 2\n\u03c6 +\n\u2212 M GR (M ) + T (M ),\n(35)\n12\n2 \u03bbR\n2\nwhere T (M ) is a finite contribution to V I (which of course is not significant for renormalizability) and\nthe field-independent terms have been discarded.\nWe observe that the CJT effective potential (35) in terms of the renormalized parameters, defined by\n\u03bb 4\n(30) and (31), is finite. One could be concerned with the unrenormalized contribution \u2212 12\n\u03c6 but since\n1\n\u03bb 4\n\u22121\nfrom Eq.(30) it follows that \u03bb(\u039b) \u2243 (\u03bbR \u2212 2 I2 ) the term \u2212 12 \u03c6 vanishes upon removal of the cutoff.2\nV = V II + V I + V 0 = \u2212\n\n2\n\nActually as emphasized in the literature (see e.g.[32]), for \u039b \u2192 \u221e with fixed-positive nonzero \u03bbR one finds from Eq.(30)\nthat \u03bb is vanishingly small but negative (\u03bb \u2192 0\u2212 ). This non-positive value of the bare coupling can be concerning [32] for\nthe stability of the theory. However it simply reflects the well known triviality of \u03bb\u03c64 theory (see e.g.[33]) and is usually\nhandled by considering a large but finite cutoff.\n\n7\n\n\fIn preparation for a key observation made in the following section let us also emphasize the exact\ncancellation of the potentially dangerous divergent terms of type m2 \u03c62 which appear with opposite signs\nin the tree level contribution V 0 and in the loop correction V II .\n\n4.2\n\nRenormalization of the effective potential for \u03b8 6= 0\n\nNow we want to address the problem of evaluating the effective potential for nonvanishing values of\nthe noncommutativity parameter \u03b8. In the analysis of the gap equation (22) one finds immediately an\nimportant complication due to nonvanishing \u03b8. In fact a constant M 2 clearly cannot be a solution of (22)\nand the gap equation must then be solved for a momentum-dependent function M 2 (p).\nWe start by defining M 2 (\u03b1) = M 2 + \u03a0(\u03b1) so that the gap equation (22) can be rewritten as\nZ\nZ\n\u03bb 2 \u03bb\n\u03bb\ndb4\ndb4\n1\ncos (b\u03b8\u03b1)\n2\n2\n\u03a0(\u03b1) = \u2212M + m + \u03c6 +\n+\n.\n2\n3\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 + \u03a0(b) 6\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 + \u03a0(b)\nWe use the freedom in the choice of the \"constant\" part of M 2 (\u03b1) to make it satisfy\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nM = m + \u03c62 +\n2\n3\n2\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\ndb4\n,\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0) b + M 2 + \u03a0(b)\n\n(36)\n\nand\n\u03a0(\u03b1) =\n\n\u03bb\n6\n\nZ\n\ndb4\ncos (b\u03b8\u03b1)\n.\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 + \u03a0(b)\n\n(37)\n\nWe notice that the integral in the right-hand-side of Eq.(37) is finite both in the ultraviolet sector and\nin the infrared sector so that Eq.(37) does not need to be renormalized. We also observe that \u03a0(\u03b1) \u2192 \u221e\nfor \u03b1 \u2192 0 and for \u03b8 \u2192 0, and that \u03a0(\u03b1) \u2192 0 for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e and for \u03b8 \u2192 \u221e.\nEquation (36), on the contrary, is not UV-finite. It can be renormalized by a procedure similar to\nthe one we have discussed previously. Introducing the renormalized parameters in the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 1\n1\n= lim\n+ I2 ,\n(38)\n\u03bbR \u039b\u2192\u221e \u03bb 3\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nm2R\nm\n1\n= lim\n+ I1 ,\n(39)\n\u039b\u2192\u221e\n\u03bbR\n\u03bb\n3\nwe get the renormalized gap equation\nM 2 = m2R +\n\n\u03bbR 2 \u03bbR\n\u03c6 +\nFR (M ),\n2\n3\n\nwhere FR (M ) is the finite part of the divergent integral in (36):\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\ndb4 1\n1\ndb4 1\ndb4\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212M\nFR (M ) =\n(2\u03c0)4 b2 + M 2 + \u03a0(b)\n(2\u03c0)4 b2\n(2\u03c0)4 b4\n\n(40)\n\nWe come now to the important issue of the renormalization of the effective potential. We have seen\nthat the way in which the gap equation renormalizes fixes uniquely the renormalization of the bare mass\nand the renormalization of the coupling. We must check if the same renormalization conditions provide\n\n8\n\n\fus a finite effective potential. We can use (36) and (37) in the expression (23) to obtain the effective\npotential as the sum of the three following terms:\n\u03bb\n1\nV 0 = m2 \u03c62 + \u03c64 ,\n2\n4!\nZ\n4\n1\n1\n1\ndk\nVI =\nln(k2 ) + I1 M 2 \u2212 I2 M 4 + T (M, \u03a0),\n4\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n4\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n2\n31\ndk4 \u03a0(k)[\u03a0(k) + 2k2 ]\nM\n1\nI2 +\n+\nV II = M 4\n2\n4\u03bb\n2\n(2\u03c0)4 k4 [k2 + \u03a0(k)]2\n\u001a\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\u03a0(k)\ndk 4\ndk4\n2\n+ M \u2212 I1 \u2212\n+\nR(k) +\n+\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\n4\n(2\u03c0)4 k2 + \u03a0(k) k2 + \u03a0(k) k2\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n3m4 3 2 2\n3\ndk4\ndk 4\n\u03a0(k)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03a0(k)R(k)\n\u2212\n\u2212 m \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c64 ,\n4\n2\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0) k + \u03a0(k) 4\n(2\u03c0)\n4\u03bb\n4\n16\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\nM2\nM4\ndk4\ndk 4\ndk4 1\ndk4 1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nln[k + M + \u03a0(k)] \u2212\nln[k ] +\n\u2212\n,\nT (M, \u03a0) =\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\n2\n(2\u03c0)4 k2\n4\n(2\u03c0)4 k4\nand\nR(k) =\n\n1\nk 2 +M 2 +\u03a0(k)\n\n\u2212\n\nn\n\n1\nk 2 +\u03a0(k)\n\n\u2212\n\nM2\n[k 2 +\u03a0(k)]2\n\no\n\n.\n\n(44)\n\nWe observe that in our CJT effective potential (V = V 0 + V I + V II ), thanks to the fact that \u03a0(k)\nvanishes exponentially in the limit k \u2192 \u221e, all the field-dependent terms, with the exception of m2 \u03c62 and\n\u03bb\u03c64 terms, are cutoff independent. The term in \u03bb\u03c64 is not divergent, it is similar to the \u03bb\u03c64 -term present\nin the commutative case and can be handled in the same way. The term in m2 \u03c62 , on the contrary, is\ngenuinely ultraviolet divergent. This is due to the fact that the corresponding contributions from V 0 and\nV II do not cancel each other (unlike the commutative case). This clearly originates from the well-known\nfact that nonvanishing \u03b8, by regularizing certain otherwise divergent diagrams, effectively changes the\nnumerical coefficients in front of some divergent terms.\nThe presence of this \u03c6-dependent contribution that diverges upon cutoff removal leads to conjecture\nthat it is impossible for this theory to be in an ordered translationally invariant phase3 .\n\n4.3\n\nRenormalization of the effective potential in the planar limit (\u03b8 \u2192 \u221e)\n\nIt is also interesting to consider the limit of strong noncommutativity (\u03b8 \u2192 \u221e). In this limit the strong\noscillations in the phases, which are present in the integrands of (22) and (23), induce the vanishing of the\ncorresponding integrals. In this limit the nonplanar contribution of the eight diagram becomes negligible\nand only the planar contribution survives. In this strong commutativity limit the effective potential is\ngiven by the sum of the terms\n1 2 2 \u03bb 4\nm \u03c6 + \u03c6 ,\n2\n4!\nZ\n4\n1\n1\ndk\n1\nln(k2 ) + I1 M 2 \u2212 I2 M 4 + T (M, 0),\nVI =\n2\n(2\u03c0)4\n2\n4\n3\n3\u03bb 4\n3 4 1 2\n3\nV II = \u2212 m4 \u2212\n\u03c6 +\nM \u2212 M G(M ) \u2212 m2 \u03c62 ,\n4\u03bb\n16\n4\u03bb\n2\n4\nV0 =\n\n3\n\n(45)\n(46)\n(47)\n\nThe fact that for \u03c6 = 0 this alarming divergence disappears might mean that instead a translationally invariant\ndisordered phase is possible.\n\n9\n\n\fso that one finds\nV =\n\n3 M4\n1\n1\n7\n\u2212 \u03bb\u03c64 \u2212 m2 \u03c62 \u2212 M 2 GR (M ) + T (M, 0).\n4 \u03bbR\n48\n4\n2\n\n(48)\n\nThis expressions for the effective potential is formally similar to the ones of the commutative case,\n(35). The crucial differences consist in the factors in front to the eight-diagram terms. It particular\nin this limit, as in the commutative case, the dressed mass M 2 (k) = M 2 + \u03a0(k) becomes momentum\nindependent since \u03a0(k) vanishes exponentially.\nAgain the cancellation between the m2 \u03c62 terms in (45) and (47) doesn't occur and the resulting\npotential doesn't renormalize.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWhereas in commutative spacetime the CJT effective potential can be renormalized and gives a satisfactory description of the vacua of a given field theory, in our canonical-noncommutativity analysis the\nCJT effective potential (in the bubble-resummation approximation) was found not to be renormalizable.\nFrom a conservative standpoint we should then assume that in this type of theories the CJT effective\npotential cannot provide reliable nonperturbative insight on the phase structure. This negative conclusion is also supported by the realization that canonical noncommutativity affects strongly the structure\nof the UV divergences of a field theory, and this might be particularly significant for those techniques\nthat effectively rely on resummations of contributions from all orders in the coupling constant. When we\nestablish that a field theory is renormalizable, we actually verify that it is \"perturbatively renormalizable\": the divergences at any given order in coupling-expansion perturbation theory can be reabsorbed\nin redefinitions of the parameters of the Lagrangian density. The fact that the CJT technique gives rise\nto a renormalizable effective potential in the commutative-spacetime case is highly nontrivial, since we\nare not consistently summing all contributions up to a given order in the coupling constant (a calculation\nwhich would be \"protected\" by perturbative renormalizability), we are instead selectively summing a\ncertain subset of the contributions at all orders in the coupling constant. It is therefore plausible that\nthe fact that our CJT effective potential cannot be renormalized is simply a sign of an inadequacy of this\ntechnique to the canonical-noncommutativity context.\nOn the other hand it appears reasonable to explore an alternative, more optimistic, perspective,\nwhich is based on the observation that the only contribution to the CJT potential that ends up not being\nexpressed in terms of renormalized quantities is the 41 m2 \u03c62 contribution. This term however will vanish in\na disordered phase \u03c6 = 0. In a certain sense we have a renormalizable effective potential in the disordered\nphase, and our results of nonrenormalizability in the translationally-invariant ordered phase \u03c6 = C could\nbe interpreted as a manifestation of the fact that this phase is not admissable for these theories in canonical\nnoncommutative spacetime. This hypothesis finds some support in the arguments presented in Ref. [19],\nwhich also concluded that the only admissible phases for these theories are the disordered phase and a\n(non-translationally-invariant) stripe phase with \u03c6\u0303(p) = C\u03b4(p \u2212 pc ) (where \u03c6\u0303(p) is the Fourier transform\nof \u03c6(x)) and pc is a characteristic momentum scale of the stripe phase). This argument of inadmissability\nof the translationally-invariant ordered phase might be related with the delicate IR structure of these\ntheories: \u03c6(x) = C means \u03c6\u0303(p) = C\u03b4(p), so the concept of a translationally-invariant ordered phase is\nclosely connected with the zero-momentum structure of the theory of interest.\n\n10\n\n\fThe fact that various lines of analysis appear to suggest that a non-translationally-invariant ordered\nphase should naturally be considered in these theories is rather intriguing. In fact canonical noncommutativity is naturally in conflict with invariance under space rotations and/or boosts, but, when analyzed as\na pure algebra of coordinates, appears to be perfectly compatible with classical translational invariance.\nIf a non translational invariant ordered phase emerges from field theories in canonical noncommutative\nspacetime it would mean that these theories might favour spontaneous breaking of their only residual\nspacetime symmetry4 (the one under spacetime translations).\nTo explore these issues it would be necessary to consider the CJT effective action, which explores\nthe more general class of candidate vacua \u03c6(x), rather than stopping, as we did here, at the level of the\nCJT effective potential (which assumes from the beginning a translationally-invariant vacuum). With\nthe CJT effective action one could investigate the renormalizability of the stripe phase (which is not\ntranslationally invariant, and therefore cannot be studied with the effective potential). Unfortunately\neven in commutative-spacetime theories the evaluation of the CJT effective action turns out to be very\ncomplex (basically intractable analytically and a troublesome calculation even numerically). It is likely\nthat in the canonical-noncommutativity context the evaluation of the CJT effective action may prove even\nmore troublesome, but from the indications that emerged from our analysis of the CJT effective potential\nit appears that such an analysis is well motivated, as it could provide insight for the understanding of\nsome key physical predictions of these theories.\n\nNote added\nThese results were first presented in Chapter 5, of my Ph.D. thesis [39]. As I was rewriting the discussion\nin a format more suitable for the article-style presentation here provided the study in Ref.[40] was\nannounced. The results reported in Ref.[40] are consistent (and partially overlap) with the ones presented\nhere and in Ref.[39].\n\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Giovanni Amelino-Camelia for the constant support during the whole period of preparation of this\npaper, for the enlightening discussions, for bringing to my attention Ref.[40] and for the careful reading\nof the manuscript.
