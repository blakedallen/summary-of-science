FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA, E. MUKHIN AND Y. TAKEYAMA\nAbstract. For a pair of positive integers (k, r) with r \u2265 2 such that k + 1 and r \u2212 1\nare relatively prime, we describe the space of symmetric polynomials in variables\nx1 , . . . , xn which vanish at all diagonals of codimension k of the form xi = tq si xi\u22121 ,\ni = 2, . . . , k + 1, where t and q are primitive roots of unity of orders k + 1 and r \u2212 1.\n\n1. Introduction: the wheel condition\nFix a finite set S of non-zero complex numbers called the wheel set. A symmetric polynomial f \u2208 C[x1 , * * * , xn ]Sn satisfies the wheel condition relative to S if f (x1 , . . . , xn ) =\n0 on all planes which have the form\nx2 = t1 x1 , x3 = t2 x2 , . . . , xl = tl\u22121 xl\u22121 , x1 = tl xl ,\n(1)\nQl\nwhere t1 , * * * , tl \u2208 S. Note that (1) implies that i=1 ti = 1. This condition is called\nthe resonance condition. We denote the space of all symmetric polynomials satisfying\nthe wheel condition associated to S by FS.\nNote that the space of symmetric polynomials in n variables satisfying the wheel\ncondition relative to S is an ideal in C[x1 , . . . , xn ].\nLet gnm be the dimension of the symmetric polynomials in n variables of degree m\nsatisfying the wheel condition. Then the character is given by\nX\n\u03c7(FSk ) =\ngnm z n v m .\nn,m\n\nThe basic question we are interested in is the computation of the character and a\nconstruction of an explicit basis in FS.\nThe study of the polynomials satisfying the wheel condition was initiated in [FJMM2].\nWe briefly describe the results of that paper.\nFor natural numbers k, r, r \u2265 2, we fix t, q \u2208 C such that the resonance condition\na\nq tb = 1 is valid if and only if a = (k + 1)s, b = (r \u2212 1)s for some s. Define the wheel\nset Sr (q, t) \u2282 C by\nSr (q, t) = {t, tq, . . . , tq r\u22121 }.\n\n(2)\n\nThe number of variable l in (1) in this case, can be a multiple of k + 1. However, it\nis easy to see that it is enough to impose the zero condition only for l = k + 1. This\nremark is also valid in the root of unity case which we will consider in this paper.\nDate: November 2, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nB. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA, E. MUKHIN AND Y. TAKEYAMA\n\nIt is proved in [FJMM2] that the space FSr (q,t) has a basis of Macdonald polynomials\n{P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; q, t)} where \u03bb ranges over the (k, r, n)-admissible partitions, satisfying\n\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbi+k \u2265 r\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 k).\n\nIn particular, the Macdonald polynomials corresponding to the admissible partitions\nare well defined. Admissible partitions appeared first in the work [P], a bosonic formula\nfor the corresponding character is given in [FJLMM].\nThe case k + 1 and r \u2212 1 are relatively prime is of special interest. In this case we\ncan assume\nt = ur\u22121 ,\nq = u\u2212(k+1) ,\nfor some u which is not a root of unity.\nThe Jack limit u \u2192 1 of the space FSkr (q,t) is spanned by the set of Jack polynomials\n{J\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; \u03b2)} where \u03b2 = \u2212(r \u2212 1)/(k + 1) and \u03bb ranges over (k, r, n)-admissible\npartitions. If (k + 1, r \u2212 1) = 1 then it is expected that the limiting space coincides with\nthe space of correlation functions of an abelian current in a vertex operator algebra,\nassociated with the minimal series (k + 1, k + r) of the Wk algebra, see [FJLMM].\n\u00bfFrom now on we assume k + 1 and r \u2212 1 are relatively prime. The present paper\ncould be viewed as the \"root of unity\" version of [FJMM2]. Namely, we consider the\ncase when u is a primitive root of unity of order (r \u2212 1)(k + 1). We have then\ntk+1 = 1 (a primitive root),\n\nq r\u22121 = 1\n\n(a primitive root).\n\n(3)\n\nWe denote the space of symmetric function satisfying the wheel condition related to the\nwheel set Sr\u22121 (q, t) with (3) by F (k,r) and the cooresponding character by \u03c7k,r (z, v).\n(k,l)\nWe also denote by Fn the subspace of F (k,l) consisting of the functions of n variables.\nr\u22121\nNote that q\n= 1, and the new wheel set with r \u2212 1 is thus related to the previous\none Sr (q, t). However, in the present case, it is not true that the resonance condition\nq a tb = 1 necessarily restricts to the case a = (k + 1)s, b = (r \u2212 1)s for some s. In other\nwords, not all vanishing planes (1) at the roots of unity case are limits of vanishing\nplanes for generic u. Therefore, we have new phenomenon in the root of unity case,\nwhich is independent of generic results of [FJMM2].\nThe plan of paper is as follows. In Section 2 we prepare some special polynomials\nfrom MacDonald's book [M]. In Section 3 we give a basis of the space F (k,2) . In Scetion\n4 we give the main results of this paper, Theorems 4.6 and 4.7, which give an explicit\nbasis in F (k,r) and the character \u03c7k,r (z, v), respectively.\n2. Macdonald polynomials\nIn this section we recall some facts we need about the theory of Macdonald polynomials and fix our notations.\n2.1. Partitions. We denote \u03c0n the set of partitions of length at most n. By this\nwe mean that an element \u03bb of \u03c0n is a nonincreasing sequence\nP of nonnegative integers\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ), \u03bb1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bbn \u2265 0. The sum |\u03bb| =\ni \u03bbi is called weight of \u03bb.\nWe denote the number of parts \u03bbj which are equal to i by mi = mi (\u03bb) and write\n\u03bb = (0m0 , 1m1 , 2m2 , . . . ).\n\n\fDIAGONAL SHIFTED BY ROOTS OF UNITY\n\n3\n\nA partition \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n is called (k, r, n)-admissible if \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbi+k \u2265 r for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 k.\nWe will use (k, 1, n)-admissibility in this paper. This is equivalent to the condition\nthat mi (\u03bb) \u2264 k for all i. In the below we simply call \u03bb is (non)-admissible with the\nunderstanding that it means the (non)-admissibility for (k, 1, n) with a prescribed value\nof k.\nThere is a partial dominance order of partitions. For two partitions \u03bb, \u03bc of the same\nweight we write \u03bb > \u03bc iff \u03bb 6= \u03bc, \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbi \u2265 \u03bc1 + * * * + \u03bci for all i.\nWe also use the total lexicographical order of partitions. For two partitions \u03bb, \u03bc of the\nsame weight we write \u03bb \u227a \u03bc iff for some i we have \u03bbi < \u03bci and \u03bbj = \u03bcj , j = 1, . . . , i \u2212 1.\n2.2. Macdonald polynomials. The Macdonald operators Dnr (q, t), 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n, are\nmutually commuting q-difference operators acting on the ring of symmetric polynomials\nC(q, t)[x1 , * * * , xn ]Sn :\nX\nAI (x; t)TI ,\nDnr =\n|I|=r\n\nwhere\n\nAI (x; t) = tr(r\u22121)/2\n\nY txi \u2212 xj\n,\nxi \u2212 xj\ni\u2208I\nj6\u2208I\n\nTI =\n\nY\n\nTq,xi ,\n\n(Tq,xi f )(x1 , * * * , xn ) = f (x1 , * * * , qxi , * * * , xn ),\n\ni\u2208I\n\nP\nand I \u2282 {1, * * * , n} runs over subsets of cardinality r. Let Dn (X; q, t) = nr=0 Dnr X r\nbe their generating function.\nFor a partition \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n the Macdonald polynomial {P\u03bb } is defined as a unique eigenvector of Dn (X; q, t) of the form\nX\nP\u03bb = m\u03bb +\nu\u03bb\u03bc m\u03bc\n(u\u03bb\u03bc \u2208 C(q, t)),\n\u03bc<\u03bb\n\nwhere\n\nm\u03bb =\n\nn\n\u0011\nY\n1 X \u0010 \u03bb1\nw x1 . . . x\u03bbnn\nmi !\ni=1\n\nw\u2208Sn\n\nis the monomial symmetric function. Here a permutation w \u2208 Sn acts on a function\nby permuting the arguments wf (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f (xw\u22121 (1) , . . . , xw\u22121 (n) ).\nSuch a polynomial is unique and the coefficients u\u03bb\u03bc are rational functions of q and\nt with possible poles of the form\nq a tb = 1\n\n(a \u2208 Z\u22650 , b \u2208 Z>0 ),\n\nsee [Int].\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are given by the formula:\nn\nY\n(1 + Xq \u03bbi tn\u2212i )P\u03bb ,\nDn (X; q, t)P\u03bb =\ni=1\n\nsee [M], VI,3,4.\nNote that the degree of P\u03bb is equal to the weight of \u03bb.\n\n\f4\n\nB. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA, E. MUKHIN AND Y. TAKEYAMA\n\n2.3. Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Let \u03bb be a partition of length n and let t \u2208 C.\nThe Hall-Littlewood polynomial P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; t) is defined by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nmi\nn Y\nY xi \u2212 txj\nY\n1 \u2212 t X \uf8ed \u03bb1\n\uf8f8.\nw x1 . . . x\u03bbnn\n(4)\nP\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; t) =\n1 \u2212 tj\nxi \u2212 xj\ni=1 j=1\n\nw\u2208Sn\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\n(k,2)\n\nWe will construct a basis of Fn\nby using these polynomials in Proposition 3.5.\nIt is well known that for generic t the function P\u03bb is a symmetric polynomial of the\nform\nX\nP\u03bb = m\u03bb +\na\u03bb\u03bc m\u03bc ,\na\u03bb\u03bc \u2208 C,\n(5)\n\u03bc<\u03bb\n\nsee [M], III 1,2.\nIt is also well known that the Hall-Littlewood polynomials are obtained from the\nMacdonald polynomials by setting q = 0: P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; t) = P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; 0, t), see\n[M], p.324. Although for r = 2 we are dealing with the case q = 1 in the wheel\ncondition, the solution is given in terms of the special case of MacDonald polynomials\nwith q = 0. This is not surprising because as we have already remarked the root of\nunity case is not a specialization of the generic case. (See Proposition 3.10.)\n3. The case r = 2\n3.1. Preliminaries. Let r = 2. Then we have q = 1, t a primitive root of unity of\norder k+1, the wheel set is {t}, and F (k,2) is the space of symmetric functions satisfying\na single condition:\nf (x, tx, t2 x, . . . , tk x, xk+2 , . . . , xn ) = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nThe condition (6) appears as the initial condition for the recurrence relation of \"deformed cycles\" in the construction of form factors in SU (k+1) invariant Thirring model\nwith values in tensor products of vector representations, see Proposition 7.2 in [T].\n(1,2)\nConsider the example k = 1 and r = 2. We have t = \u22121, and the space Fn\nconsists of polynomials of the form\nY\n(xi + xj )g(x1 , . . . , xn ),\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nwhere g is any symmetric function. In the generic case for k = 1 and r = 2 the wheel\nset is {t, t\u22121 } with t 6= \u22121. The functions satisfying the wheel condition have the form\nY\n(xi \u2212 txj )(xj \u2212 txi )g(x1 , . . . , xn ).\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\n(1,2)\n\nThe space Fn\nt = \u22121.\n\nis greater than the space of functions for the generic case in the limit\n\n\fDIAGONAL SHIFTED BY ROOTS OF UNITY\n(k,2)\n\n5\n(k,2)\n\n(k,2)\n\n3.2.

Then, the degree of e\u03bb is equal to the weight of \u03bb. For \u03bc \u2208 \u03c0m and \u03bd \u2208 \u03c0n\nwe define \u03bb = \u03bc \u222a \u03bd \u2208 \u03c0m+n by joining the parts of \u03bc and \u03bd.

The elements {\u0113\u03bb } with admissible partitions \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n , i.e., those satisfying\n(k,2)\nthe condition mi (\u03bb) \u2264 k for all i, span En .\nProof. We fix nonnegative integers d, n and work with a finite-dimensional space generated by e\u03bb with partitions \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n of weight d.\nWe claim that if \u03bb is nonadmissible, i.e., mi > k for some i \u2265 0, then \u0113\u03bb is a linear\ncombination of \u0113\u03bd such that \u03bd \u227b \u03bb.\nIndeed, if i = 0 then \u0113\u03bb = 0 and there is nothing to prove. Otherwise let \u03bb\u0303 \u2208 \u03c0n\u2212k\u22121\nbe a partition obtained from \u03bb by deleting k + 1 parts equal to i. Then we have\ne\u03bb = e(ik+1 ) e\u03bb\u0303 where e\u03bb\u0303 \u2208 En\u2212k\u22121 .\nWe use the relation \u01edi \u0113\u03bb\u0303 = 0 and get (see (7))\nX\nc\u03bc,i \u0113\u03bc\u222a\u03bb\u0303 .\n\u0113\u03bb = \u0113(ik+1 ) \u0113\u03bb\u0303 = \u2212(\u22121)ik\n\u03bc\u227b(ik+1 )\n\nand our claim is proved.\nNow the lemma follows. Indeed, we rewrite \u0113\u03bb in terms of \u0113\u03bd with larger \u03bd (with\nrespect to \u227b ordering). Then we rewrite nonadmissible \u0113\u03bd appearing in this sum in\nterms of \u0113\u03c1 with even larger partitions \u03c1 and so on. Since our space is finite-dimensional,\nafter finitely many repetitions we obtain a sum with only admissible partitions.\n\u0003\nIn fact we will show (see Corollary 3.7) that the elements {\u0113\u03bb } with admissible\n(k,2)\npartitions \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n are linearly independent and therefore form a basis in En .\n\n\fDIAGONAL SHIFTED BY ROOTS OF UNITY\n\n7\n\n3.4. A basis in F (k,2) . Let t be a primitive root of unity of order k + 1.\nProposition 3.5. The set of Hall-Littlewood polynomials {P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; t)}, where \u03bb\nranges over all admissible partitions is a basis of F (k,2) .\nProof. The admissibility of \u03bb is nothing but mi (\u03bb) \u2264 k. It implies that polynomials\n{P\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ; t)} have no pole when the variable t in (4) specializes to the root of\nunity, tk+1 = 1. Because of (5) they are linearly independent. It is also clear from the\ndefinition that they satisfy the condition (6), since every term in (4) satisfies it.\nOn the other hand, by Lemma 3.3, the dimension of the space of polynomials in\n(k,2)\n(k,2)\nFn\nof degree d is equal to the dimension of the subspace of degree d in En . By\nLemma 3.4 it is bounded from above by the number of admissible partitions in \u03c0n of\nweight d.\nSince we have as many linearly independent function P\u03bb of degree d as the number of\nadmissible partitions in \u03c0n of weight d, they form a basis and the bounds are actually\nequalities.\n\u0003\n3.5.

The corresponding character cannot be written in such a simple factored form.\nNow from the comparison of dimensions we also obtain:\nCorollary 3.7.

We describe the division with remainders of partition by positive integers.\nBy definition, the result of addition of two partitions \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 \u03c0n is a partition (\u03bb+\u03bc) \u2208\n\u03c0n with components \u03bbi + \u03bci , i = 1, . . . , n. In particular, the result of multiplication\nof a partition \u03bb by a positive integer r \u2212 1 is the partition (r \u2212 1)\u03bb with components\n(r \u2212 1)\u03bbi . A partition \u03bb is called divisible by a positive integer r \u2212 1 if all parts \u03bbi are\ndivisible by r \u2212 1.\nLet a symmetric polynomial f (x1 , . . . , xn ) be expressed in terms of monomial funcP\ntions f = \u03bb c\u03bb m\u03bb , c\u03bb \u2208 C. Then f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = f \u0303(x1r\u22121 , . . . , xnr\u22121 ) for some symmetric polynomial f \u0303 if and only if c\u03bb = 0 for all \u03bb which are not divisible by r \u2212 1.\nA partition \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n is called (r \u2212 1)-slim if \u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbi+1 < r \u2212 1 for i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 and\n\u03bbn < r \u2212 1. We denote the subset of \u03c0n consisting of all (r \u2212 1)-slim partitions by \u03c0ns .\nThe cardinality of \u03c0ns is N = (r \u2212 1)n .\nThe following lemma is straightforward.\nLemma 4.2. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n . There is a unique way to represent \u03bb in the form\n\u03bb = (r \u2212 1)\u03bc + \u03bd,\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 \u03c0n are partitions and \u03bd is (r \u2212 1)-slim. \u0003\nThe partitions \u03bc, \u03bd in the lemma are called the quotient and the remainder of partition\n\u03bb divided by integer r \u2212 1.\n4.3. Wheel condition is broken if the highest partition is slim. A symmetric\npolynomial f (x1 , . . . , xn ) is called of highest partition \u03bb if it has the form\nX\nf = c\u03bb m\u03bb +\nc\u03bc m\u03bc\n(c\u03bc \u2208 C),\n\u03bc<\u03bb\n\nwhere c\u03bb is a nonzero complex number.\n\n\f10\n\nB.

We\nclaim that g does not satisfy the wheel condition, that is g 6\u2208 F (k,r) . We prove a slightly\nstronger statement.\nProposition 4.3. Let \u03bc \u2208 \u03c0ns be an (r \u2212 1)-slim partition and let g\u03bc be of highest\npartition \u03bc. If n > k then for any non-zero complex number c there exist s1 , . . . , sk \u2208\n{0, 1, . . . , r \u2212 2} such that g(cq s1 , ctq s2 , . . . , ctk q sk+1 , xk+2 , . . . , xn ) 6= 0.\nProof. We fix a non-zero complex number c. Let CN (N = (r \u2212 1)n ) be the vector\nspace with basis {us } where the index s = (s1 , . . . , sn ) ranges over all sequences such\nthat si \u2208 {0, . . . , r \u2212 2}. Let m = n \u2212 k \u2212 1 \u2265 0. For y = (y1 , . . . , ym ) \u2208 Cm , define the\nevaluation map\n\u03bay :\n\nC[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn \u2192 CN\nX\nf 7\u2192\nf (cq s1 , ctq s2 , . . . , ctk q sk+1 , y1 q sk+2 , . . . , ym q sn )us .\ns\n\nWe need to show that there exists y such that \u03bay (g\u03bc ) 6= 0.\n(k,r)\nIf f \u2208 Fn\nthen \u03bay (f ) =P\n0 for all y. If f is in the image of the Frobenius homomorphism then \u03bay (f ) = a(y) s us for some a(y) \u2208 C.\nFor each \u03bb \u2208 \u03c0n choose a symmetric polynomial f\u03bb with highest partition \u03bb. Then\n{f\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u03c0n is a basis in C[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn . For each slim partition \u03bc \u2208 \u03c0ns choose a symmetric polynomial g\u03bc with highest partition \u03bc. Then {g\u03bc F(f\u03bb )}\u03bb\u2208\u03c0n ,\u03bc\u2208\u03c0ns is also a basis\nin C[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn .\nIn particular the algebra C[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn is a free module of rank N with generators\ng\u03bc over the image of the Frobenius homomorphism . Therefore, if \u03bay (g\u03bc ) = 0 for some\nslim partition \u03bc and all y, then for all y the map \u03bay is not surjective. We claim it is\nimpossible.\nIndeed, for generic choice of (y1 , . . . , ym ) \u2208 Cm , the images of the N evaluation\npoints (cq s1 , ctq s2 , . . . , ctk q sk+1 , y1 q sk+2 , . . . , ym q n ) in the quotient space A = Cn /Sn\nare all distinct. Therefore the algebra of polynomials C[A] = C[x1 , . . . , xn ]Sn separates\nthese points and the evaluation map is surjective.\n\u0003\n4.4. The main results. We still have t and q as in (3). Recall Macdonald's operators\nDnr .\n(k,r)\n\nLemma 4.4. If f \u2208 Fn\nsatisfies the wheel condition then Dnr (q, t\u0303)f satisfies the\nwheel condition for all r \u2208 Z>0 and t\u0303 \u2208 C.\nProof. If a function (not necessary symmetric) f satisfies the wheel conditions then\nTq,xi f also satisfies the wheel conditions for all i = 1, . . . , n. The statement follows\nfrom this observation.\n\u0003\nConsider a symmetric polynomial h(x1 , . . . , xn ) of the form\nh(x1 , . . . , xn ) =\n\ns\nX\ni=1\n\nfi gi ,\n\n(11)\n\n\fDIAGONAL SHIFTED BY ROOTS OF UNITY\n\n11\n\nwhere the highest partitions of gi are all slim and distinct and fi = F(f \u0303i ) are all in the\nimage of the Frobenius homomorphism.\n(k,r)\n\nProposition 4.5.

The \"if\" part of the Proposition is obvious.\nTo prove the \"only if\" part, we first assume that gi = P\u03bb(i) (q, t\u0303) are Macdonald\npolynomials with some t\u0303 \u2208 C which is not a root of unity and all \u03bb(i) are distinct and\nslim.

Since eigenvalues nj=1 (1+Xq \u03bbj t\u0303n\u2212j ),\ni = 1, . . . , s, are all distinct, we conclude that gi fi satisfies the wheel condition for all\ni. Now, since for gi the wheel condition is broken by Proposition 4.3, we get fi is zero\n(k,2)\non one of the vanishing planes and therefore f \u0303i \u2208 Fn .\nNow we prove the general case by induction on s. Let \u03bb(i) be the highest partitions\nof gi . Without loss of generality we assume that \u03bb(s) is maximal in the set {\u03bb(i) }. Then\nh can be written in the form\nX\nP\u03bc (q, t\u0303)f\u03bc\n(a \u2208 C, a 6= 0),\nh = aP\u03bb(s) (q, t\u0303)fs +\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere f\u03bc = F(f \u0303\u03bc ) are in the image of Frobenius homomorphism and the sum is over slim\npartitions \u03bc such that \u03bc 6= \u03bb(s) . Therefore, using the previous argument we conclude\nPs\u22121\n(k,r)\nthat fs \u2208 Rn .

The polynomials {f\u03bb g\u03bc }, where \u03bc ranges over all (r \u2212 1)-slim partitions\n(k,r)\nand \u03bb ranges over admissible partitions, form a basis in Fn .\u0003.\nAs a corollary we obtain a description of the character \u03c7k,r (z, v) of the space F (k,r) .\nTheorem 4.7. The character of the space F (k,r) is given by\n\u03c7k,r (z, v) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nn\nY\n1 \u2212 v s(r\u22121)\nr\u22121\nb(k)\n(v\n)\nn\n1 \u2212 vs\ns=1\n\nwhere the coefficients bn (v) are given by (9).\n\n!\n\nzn,\n\n\f12\n\nB. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA, E. MUKHIN AND Y. TAKEYAMA\n\nProof. The z n term of the character \u03c7k,r (z, v) is the product of the character of (r \u2212 1)slim partitions of length at most n and the z n term of the character \u03c7k,2 (z, v r\u22121 ).\n(k)\nThe character \u03c7k,2 (z, v) is computed in Proposition 3.6, it's zn term is bnQ(v) and\nthe character of the (r \u2212 1)-slim partitions in \u03c0n is equal to the product ns=1 (1 \u2212\nv s(r\u22121) )/(1 \u2212 v s ).\n\u0003\nAcknowledgments.
