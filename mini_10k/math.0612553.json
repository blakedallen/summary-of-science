The crucial point\nhere is to prove that X can be extended by adding a fixed point of S, thus\nallowing application of a semigroup version of the Arens-Eells linearization,\niff the orbits of S in X are bounded.\n\nIntroduction\nBy a well-known construction due to Arens and Eells [1], every metric space can\nbe isometrically embedded as a closed metric subspace of a normed (linear) space.\nUsing this construction (or other linear extensions like the free Banach space), one\ncan show [4, 3] that a non-expansive action \u03c0 of a topological semigroup S on\na metric space is linearizable, i.e. arises by restricting an action of S by linear\ncontractions on a normed space V to a metric subspace of V , if \u03c0 has a fixed point\nz (which then serves as the 0 of V ). The question of when an action \u03c0 is linearizable\nin general thus reduces to the question of when \u03c0 can be extended by adding a fixed\npoint.\nIt is trivial to observe that if X is bounded, then \u03c0 may be extended by adding a\nfixed point: introduce a new point z, make z a fixed point of S, and put d(z, x) = c\nfor all x \u2208 X, where c > diam(X). It is then easy to check that the distance\nfunction d thus defined on X \u222a {z} is a metric, and that the action of S on the\nextended space is non-expansive. Here, we improve on this construction by giving\na necessary and sufficient criterion: \u03c0 may be extended by adding a fixed point iff\nits orbits are bounded sets. We thus obtain an exact linearizability criterion: \u03c0 is\nlinearizable iff its orbits are bounded.\n\n1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nThroughout the exposition, fix a topological semigroup S. We shall generally be\nconcerned with non-expansive actions \u03c0 : S \u00d7 X \u2192 X, with \u03c0(s, x) denoted as s * x,\nof S on metric spaces (X, d), i.e. d(s * x, s * y) \u2264 d(x, y) for all s \u2208 S and all x, y \u2208 X.\nIn the special case that (X, d) is a real normed space V , we say that \u03c0 is linear if the\ntranslation maps s\u0306 : x 7\u2192 s * x are linear maps on V . In this case, non-expansivity\nof \u03c0 means that the s\u0306 are contracting, i.e. ks * xk \u2264 kxk for all x. We say that a\nmap f : X \u2192 Y is equivariant w.r.t. an action of S on Y if f (s * x) = s * f (x) for all\nx \u2208 X.\nWe note an observation from [3], omitting the (straightforward) proof:\n1\n\n\fLemma 1. For a non-expansive action \u03c0 : S \u00d7 X \u2192 X on a metric space (X, d),\nthe following are equivalent.\n1. The action \u03c0 is jointly continuous.\n2. The action \u03c0 is separately continuous.\n3. The restriction \u03c0 : S \u00d7 Y \u2192 X to some dense subspace Y of X is separately\ncontinuous.\nWe shall henceforth implicitly include the requirement that S \u00d7 X \u2192 X is\ncontinuous in the term non-expansive action (thus avoiding the term 'non-expansive\ncontinuous action', which is a bit of a mouthful). As an immediate consequence of\nthe preceding lemma, we obtain the following extension result [3]:\nLemma 2. A linear non-expansive action of S on a normed space V extends\n(uniquely) to a linear non-expansive action of S on the completion of V .\nWe denote the orbit {s * x | s \u2208 S} of x \u2208 X under S by S * x. Note that orbits\nneed not be disjoint, elements of an orbit need not have the same orbit, and x need\nnot be contained in its orbit S * x. In case S is a monoid, however, x \u2208 S * x for all\nx \u2208 X.\n\n2\n\nFixed Points and Linearizations\n\nWe now give the announced criterion for extendibility by a fixed point:\nTheorem 3. Let (X, d) be a metric space equipped with a non-expansive action of\nS. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. The space X can be extended by adding a fixed point of S, i.e. there exists a\nmetric space (Y, d) equipped with a non-expansive action of S that has a fixed\npoint, and an isometric and equivariant embedding of X into Y .\n2. The orbits S * x of S in X are bounded sets.\nThe following definition will be useful in the proof:\nDefinition 4. Let (X, d) be a metric space. For A \u2286 X and x \u2208 X, we put\nsupdist(x, A) = sup d(x, y) \u2208 [0, \u221e].\ny\u2208A\n\nProof. (Theorem 3) (1) =\u21d2 (2): We can assume that X is a subspace of Y . Let\nz \u2208 Y be a fixed point of S. Then we have, for x \u2208 X and s, t \u2208 S,\nd(s * x, t * x) \u2264 d(s * x, z) + d(z, t * x)\n= d(s * x, s * z) + d(t * z, t * x)\n\u2264 2d(x, z),\ni.e. diam(S * x) \u2264 2d(x, z).\n(2) =\u21d2 (1): To begin, we reduce to the case that S is a monoid, as follows.\nFor a semigroup S, we have the free monoid Se over S, constructed by taking\nSe = S \u222a {e}, where e \u2208\n/ S, and putting es = se = s for all s \u2208 Se . The action of S\non X is extended to a (non-expansive) action of Se by e * x = x for all x \u2208 X. The\norbits Se * x = {x} \u222a S * x are bounded (by d(x, s * x) + diam(S * x) for any s \u2208 S).\nBy the monoid case of the theorem, we obtain an extended space (Y, d) in which Se\n2\n\n\fhas a fixed point z; the action of Se restricts to an action of S on Y , and z trivially\nremains a fixed point of S.\nWhen S is a monoid, then x \u2208 S * x for all x \u2208 X. We can assume w.l.o.g. that\nthere exists a point x0 \u2208 X which is not fixed under S. We put Y = X \u222a {z}, where\nz\u2208\n/ X,\nd(z, x) = d(x, z) = supdist(x0 , S * x)\nfor x \u2208 X, and d(z, z) = 0. We have to check that this makes (Y, d) a metric\nspace. To begin, d(x, z) > 0 for x \u2208 X: we have supdist(x0 , S * x0 ) > 0 because\nx0 is not fixed under S, and for x 6= x0 , supdist(x0 , S * x) \u2265 d(x0 , x) > 0 (using\nx \u2208 S * x). Symmetry holds by construction. Moreover, for x \u2208 X, d(x0 , s * x) \u2264\nd(x0 , x) + d(x, s * x) \u2264 d(x0 , x) + diam(S * x) for all s \u2208 S (again using x \u2208 S * x) and\nhence d(x, z) \u2264 d(x0 , x) + diam(S * x) < \u221e by (2). It remains to prove the triangle\ninequality. There are only two non-trivial cases to prove:\n(a) d(x, z) \u2264 d(x, y) + d(y, z) for x, y \u2208 X, and\n(b) d(x, y) \u2264 d(x, z) + d(y, z) for x, y \u2208 X.\nAd (a): Let s \u2208 S. Then d(x0 , s*x) \u2264 d(x0 , s*y)+d(s*y, s*x) \u2264 d(x0 , s*y)+d(y, x).\nThus, supdist(x0 , S * x) \u2264 d(x, y) + supdist(x0 , S * y).\nAd (b): We have\nd(x, y) \u2264 d(x, x0 ) + d(y, x0 )\n\u2264 supdist(S * x, x0 ) + supdist(S * y, x0 )\n= d(x, z) + d(y, z),\nwhere the second inequality uses x \u2208 S * x.\nWe then extend the action of S to Y by letting z be fixed under S. It is clear that\nthis really defines an action of S; we have to check that this action is non-expansive.\nFor x \u2208 X and s \u2208 S, we have\nd(s * x, s * z) = d(s * x, z)\n= supdist(x0 , S * (s * x))\n\u2264 supdist(x0 , S * x)\n= d(x, z),\nwhere the inequality uses S * (s * x) \u2286 S * x.\nIt remains to prove that S \u00d7 Y \u2192 Y is continuous, i.e. by Lemma 1 that the\norbit maps S \u2192 Y, s 7\u2192 s * y, are continuous. For y \u2208 X, this follows from continuity\nof the action on X, and for y = z, the orbit map is constant.\nRemark 5. In case S is a group, one can identify the space Y constructed in the\nabove proof with the subspace {{x} | x \u2208 X} \u222a {S * x0 } of the space of bounded\nsubsets of X, equipped with the Hausdorff pesudometric\nd(A, B) := max{sup{d(a, B) : a \u2208 A}, sup{d(A, b) : b \u2208 B}}\nand the natural action taking A to s * A for s \u2208 S. For arbitrary semigroups S,\nhowever, orbits will in general fail to be fixed points under the natural action.\nRemark 6. Analogously as in the proof of (1) =\u21d2 (2) in the above theorem, one\nshows that for x, y \u2208 X, diam(S * y) \u2264 2d(x, y) + diam(S * x). Thus, for boundedness\nof all orbits it suffices to require that there exists a bounded orbit.\n3\n\n\fWe now briefly recall the Arens-Eells extension of a pointed metric space (X, d, z)\n(i.e. z \u2208 X). One constructs a real normed space (A(X), k k) by taking as the\nelements of A(X) the formal linear combinations\nn\nX\n\nci (xi \u2212 yi ),\n\ni=1\n\nwith xi , yi \u2208 X and ci \u2208 R and putting for u \u2208 A(X)\n)\n( n\nn\nX\nX\nci (xi \u2212 yi ) .\n|ci |d(xi , yi ) | u =\nkuk = inf\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nThe space (X, d) is isometrically embedded into A(X) (as a closed subspace) by\ntaking x \u2208 X to x \u2212 z. It is shown in [3] (Proposition 2.10) that a non-expansive\naction of S on X can be extended to a linear non-expansive action of S on A(X)\nby putting\nn\nn\nX\nX\nci (s * xi \u2212 s * yi ).\nci (xi \u2212 yi ) =\ns*\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n(A similar construction can be found already in [4]; moreover, the Arens-Eells extension may be replaced by other linear extensions [2], e.g. the free Banach space\nover X as in [4].)\nWe then immediately obtain the announced exact linearizability criterion.\nTheorem 7. For a non-expansive action of S on a metric space (X, d), the following are equivalent:\n1. There exists a Banach space V , equipped with a linear non-expansive action\nof S, and an equivariant isometric embedding of (X, d) into V .\n2. The orbits S * x of S in X are bounded sets.\nProof. (1) =\u21d2 (2): By the corresponding direction of Theorem 3, as 0 is a fixed\npoint of S in V .\n(2) =\u21d2 (1): By Theorem 3, we may assume that S has a fixed point z in X. By\nLemma 2, it suffices to construct V as a normed space. We thus may take V as the\nArens-Eells extension of (X, d, z), equipped with the S-action described above.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
