To improve the wavelength coverage we retrieved data\nfrom the SDSS and 2MASS and combined these with our data. Ionized gas is detected\nin 25 galaxies and shows in most cases a smooth morphology, although knots and filamentary structure are also observed in some objects. The extended gas distribution\nclosely follows the dust structure, with a clear correlation between the mass of both\ncomponents. An extinction law by the extragalactic dust in the dark lanes is derived\nand is used to estimate the dust content of the galaxies. The derived extinction law\nis used to correct the measured colours for intrinsic dust extinction and the data are\nfitted with a stellar population synthesis model. We find that the H\u03b1 emission and\ncolours of most objects are consistent with the presence of an \"old\" stellar population\n(\u223c 10 Gyr) and a small fraction of a \"young\" population (\u223c 10 \u2212 100 Myr). To check\nthis we closely examine NGC5363, for which archival Spitzer/IRAC and GALEX data\nare available, as a representative dust-lane E/S0 galaxy of the sample.\nKey words: galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; galaxies: ISM; dust, extinction.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFor many years elliptical galaxies (Es) were considered as\ngas-poor objects (see Schweizer 1987 for a review), which\nformed in a single burst and evolved with no further star\nformation (Eggen et al. 1962). However, improved detector sensitivity along with new discoveries of gas and dust\nof low column density in E/S0s brought fresh interest to\nthis field. We now know that E/S0s host a multi-phase gas\ncomponent with hot, X-ray emitting gaseous halos (Forman,\nJones & Tucker 1985; Canizares Fabbiano & Trinchieri 1987;\nO'Sullivan, Forbes & Ponman 2001), warm ionized gas (IG)\n(Demoulin-Ulrich, Butcher & Boksenberg 1984; Phillips et\nal. 1986), cold neutral-hydrogen (e.g., Knapp, Turner &\nCunniffe 1985) and molecular gas (e.g., Lees et al. 1991).\n\u22c6\n\nFull Tables 3, 6 and 7 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\n\u2020 E-mail: ido@wise.tau.ac.il (IF); noah@wise.tau.ac.il (NB);\njfunes@specola.va\n(JGB);\nakniazev@saao.ac.za\n(AYK);\npetri@saao.ac.za (PV)\n\nThe gas component in E/S0s is often morphologically\nassociated with the presence of dust. Evidence for the presence of dust includes optical observations of obscured regions\n(Van Dokkum & Franx 1995; Ferrari et al. 1999; Tomita et\nal. 2000; Tran et al. 2001) and the detection of far-IR emission from cold dust in a large fraction of E/S0s (Knapp et\nal. 1989; Roberts et al. 1991). The galaxies where dust obscuration produces well-defined dark lanes are known in the\nliterature as dust-lane E/S0s.\n\nThe growing number of E/S0s in which a multiphase\nISM is detected implies that the stellar population and abundances in this class of galaxies trace complex and varied star\nformation histories (SFHs). A recent burst of star formation\nin an E/S0 galaxy is expected to have a significant influence\non the broad-band colours of the galaxy, even if the mass\nfraction of the young population is relatively small (see Fig.\n4 in Schawinski et al. 2007). A recent analysis of optical\nspectra and of UV photometry in E/S0s shows that a significant fraction of these galaxies experienced low-level star\n\n\f2\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\n\nformation within the past few Gyr (e.g., Yi et al. 2005; Di\nMatteo et al. 2007; Kaviraj et al. 2007).\nThe star formation activity in a certain galaxy can\nalso be examined by studying emission-lines. The systematic\nsearch of IG in E/S0s with long-slit spectroscopic surveys\nallows the detection of various emission lines linked with excited and ionized gas (Caldwell 1984; Phillips et al. 1986;\nRampazzo et al. 2005; Sarzi et al. 2006; Serra et al. 2008).\nEmission-line gas imaging enables the detecting of low levels\nof star formation even in faint galaxies with relatively modest integration times on small telescopes, and is therefore\noften used to reveal the full spatial extent of the IG. In particular, observing a galaxy with a filter centered at the restframe H\u03b1 line can, under reasonable assumptions, provide\ninformation on the amount of ionizing radiation emitted by\nstars. Surveys focusing on H\u03b1 emission imaging (Kim 1989;\nShields 1991; Trinchieri & di Serego Alighieri 1991; Buson\net al. 1993; Goudfrooij et al. 1994a; Singh et al. 1995; Macchetto et al. 1996; Martel et al. 2004) detect IG in & 50%\nof the E/S0s, and reveal various IG morphologies such as\nflattened disk-like or ring-like structures, or a filamentary\nstructure.\nThis paper studies a sample of E/S0s where dust lanes\n(DLs) have been reported in the literature and focuses on\nthe dust and IG components and their interrelation, and on\nthe stellar population within the gaseous disks. The paper\nis organized as follows: \u00a7 2 gives a description of all the\nobservations and data reduction, \u00a7 3 details the broad-band\nand narrow-band flux calibration, and the data analysis is\npresented in \u00a7 4. The results are discussed in \u00a7 5 and a\nsummary of our conclusions is given in \u00a7 6.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nThe sample\n\nIn most studies of the multiphase ISM in E/S0s the sample is selected by the presence of a particular ISM component, inferred by known tracers, such as X-ray emission,\nFIR emission or radio emission. Similarly, our sample consists of galaxies identified as dust-lane E/S0 galaxies. Most\nof these galaxies are chosen from the Bertola (1987) compilation where a close inspection of the presence of DLs was\nmade. Other objects are selected from more recent studies\nof E/S0 with DLs, including the search for cold gas (Gregorini, Messina & Vettolani 1989; M\u00f6llenhoff, Hummel &\nBender 1992; Wang, Kenney & Ishizuki 1992) and the determination of the extragalactic dust extinction law in the\ndark lanes (Goudfrooij et al. 1994b; Patil et al. 2007; Finkelman et al. 2008). The sample galaxies are listed in Table\n1 with their coordinates, morphological classification, integrated blue luminosity, heliocentric velocity and optical size\ntaken from the RC3 catalog (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1992) or\nfrom the HyperLEDA data base (Paturel et al. 2003).\n\n2.2\n\n(WO). Observations with the 1.8m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) at the MGIO were performed in\ntwo runs in June 2004 and May 2006 using the Loral CCD\nat the aplanatic f/9 Gregorian focus. A second set of observations was performed at the SAAO 1.9m telescope in\nSutherland, South Africa, in November 2008. The images\nwere obtained with the 3:1 \"Shara\" focal reducer attached\nbetween the f/18 Cassegrain focal plane of the telescope and\nthe STE4 CCD. A third set of observations was performed\nwith the PI VersArray camera mounted on the WO 1m telescope.\nThe basic characteristics of the narrow-band filters used\nfor our sample galaxies, including the central wavelength,\nFWHM and peak transmission, are listed in Table 2. The\ndates of observations, the broad-band filters used in each\nrun, the exposure times and typical seeing are given in Table\n3.\n\n2.3\n\nData reduction\n\nImage reduction was performed with standard tasks within\nIRAF1 . These include bias subtraction, overscan subtraction\nand flatfield correction. Cosmic rays events were removed\nfrom single CCD exposures by using the L.A.Cosmic task\nin IRAF (van Dokkum 2001) while CCD hot pixels were\nremoved with the FIXPIX task in IRAF using an appropriate\nmask. Interference fringes, which showed in the WO I-band\nimages, were removed in a standard manner.\nThe reduced images are geometrically aligned by measuring centroids of several common stars in the galaxy\nframes and are then background-subtracted and combined\nwith median scaling to improve the S/N ratio and remove\ncosmic ray events. This alignment procedure involves IRAF\ntasks for scaling, translation and rotation of the images, so\nthat a small amount of blurring is introduced affecting the\naccuracy to be better than a few hundredths of a pixel.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nFLUX CALIBRATION\nMeasuring the line emission\n\nWe observed each galaxy using two filters, a narrow-band\nfilter (FWHM\u223c 70\u00c5) which covers the rest-frame H\u03b1+[NII]\nemission, and a broad R-band filter with a band-width of\n\u223c 1000\u00c5 (see Table 3). The H\u03b1 images include photons from\nthe H\u03b1 and the [NII] lines and from the continuum. Since we\nare interested in the H\u03b1 line, the continuum signal should be\nremoved. This is performed in several steps. The H\u03b1 and Rband images are first geometrically aligned, convolved to the\nsame resolution and background subtracted. The R image is\nlater scaled to match the stellar continuum in the narrowband image.\nThe intensity scaling factor (ISF) is determined by comparing the light from the underlying galaxy (see Macchetto\net al. 1996; B\u00f6ker et al. 1999) and the intensity of foreground\n\nObservations\n\nWe present broad-band U, B, V, R, I and H\u03b1 narrow-band\nobservations of 30 galaxies acquired at the Mt.

Since different foreground stars may have different colours, we also plot\nthe colour of the stars vs. their ISF to interpolate for the\nadequate ISF of a galaxy with a certain colour. The derived\nISF is then used to obtain a continuum-subtracted image.\nThe continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] images are then\nused to measure the emission within an elliptical aperture enclosing the apparent IG disk-like region of each\ngalaxy and within individual H\u03b1 knots, if present. The aperture limits are set to include resolution elements with net\n\nH\u03b1+[NII] emission \u223c 2\u03c3 above the noise as measured in the\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] images. For galaxies with\nno apparent extended emission structure, a circular aperture with a radius twice the FWHM seeing size around the\ngalactic center is examined in an attempt to detect inner\nline emission. Since the measured net H\u03b1+[NII] emission in\na galaxy may have high relative errors if the line emission is\ndiffuse or weak, the detection criterion for the presence of IG\nin our sample was arbitrarily set to relative errors smaller\nthan 75%.\n\n\f4\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\n\nTable 3.

These are compared with the stellar\nisophotal major axis diameter at the \u03bcB =25 mag arcsec\u22122\nisophote (taken from RC3 and HyperLEDA), D25 in arcmin,\nthe major axis position angle \u03b825 , and the axial ratio of the\nlimiting isophote (b/a)25 of the host galaxy. We also list the\nratio of the disk-to-galaxy isophotal diameter Ddisk /D25 to\nshow the extension of the IG region with respect to the\ngalaxy size. Uncertainties in the galaxy characteristics are\n\nof order \u00b110%, and the uncertainty in \u03b8disk , which is estimated by eye due to the clumpy morphology, is typically\n\u00b15 deg.\n\n3.2\n\nEmission-line flux calibration\n\nTo convert the measured H\u03b1+[NII] counts into physical\nunits we calibrate the set of single R-band exposures by using standard stars (Landolt 1992) and determine the R-band\nflux density, IR . The ratio between the H\u03b1+[NII] flux and\nthe R-band flux density is a measure of the effective equivalent width (EW ) of these lines, EWH\u03b1+[NII] , and reflects\n\n\fIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes\nthe power of ionization with respect to the stellar light of\nthe galaxy. Calculating this ratio should take into account\nnot only the measured H\u03b1+[NII] counts, but also the filters\ntransmission.\nIt can be shown that the calibrated H\u03b1+[NII] flux corresponds to\n\n3.3\n\nFigure 1.

The derivation of this\nrelation does not take into account possible variations due\nto subtle differences in the wavelength-dependent sensitivity\nof the two optical systems, nor any subtle variations due to\nthe wavelength-dependent atmospheric extinction. We also\nassume that the emission is concentrated entirely in a single line, \u03bbH\u03b1 . The measured H\u03b1+[NII] flux, luminosity and\nEW for each galaxy are listed in Table 5.\nMeasuring the continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] flux is\nsubject to various errors (see Macchetto et al. 1996). The\ndominant error source in deriving the line fluxes is the continuum subtraction, i.e., the uncertainty in determining the\nISF. Therefore, estimating the errors depends strongly on\nthe EW of the line emission. James et al. (2004) measured\nerrors of \u223c 15% for EW > 20\u00c5 and \u223c 35% for galaxies with\nEW < 20\u00c5 in their study of narrow-band H\u03b1+[NII] imaging\nof a large sample of nearby galaxies with different morphologies. These are in agreement with the flux errors derived in\nour study (see Table 5). A manifestation of the high uncertainty in determining the line emission flux in the literature\nis clearly shown for the case of NGC4374. Comparing the\nresults of the H\u03b1+[NII] measurements in five previous studies (Kim 1989; Trinchieri & di Serego Alighieri 1991; Shields\n1991; Goudfrooij et al. 1994a; Sarzi et al. 2006) we find a\nlarge scatter with values in the range (8 \u2212 38) \u00d7 10\u221214 erg\ns\u22121 cm\u22122 , where our measurement also lies. This large scatter is further illustrated in Macchetto et al. (1996) where a\ncomparison of the H\u03b1 measurements of their sample galaxies with the literature data shows differences up to a factor\nof 3.\n\n5\n\n14\n13\n12\n11\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nB25\n\n14\n\n15\n\nal. 2003). The measured B-band magnitudes are plotted vs.\nthe values from the HyperLEDA database in Fig. 1. We also\nmeasure the B-magnitude and colours within the aperture\nenclosing the apparent IG disk-like region of each galaxy. To\nimprove the wavelength coverage we retrieved data from the\nSDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) and 2MASS archives for galaxies where they are available. We then calculate the flux by\nmatching the apertures to those used for our observations\nand calibrating the data with the formal pipelines. The results are listed in Tables 6 and 7.\nIn addition we present in APPENDIX A a R-band contour map image, a continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] narrowband image and a B-R colour image for each galaxy.\n\n4\n\nANALYSIS\n\nIn this section we discuss the analysis of the dust and IG\ncomponents based on the imaging data and photometric results. We first study the ISM by deriving the extinction law\nin the dark lanes, and by estimating the mass of the dust and\nIG components. We then combine the extinction-corrected\ncolours with the measured H\u03b1+[NII] flux to determine an\napproximate SFH for each object.\n\nBroad-band flux calibration\n\nThe broad-band images were flux-calibrated using Landolt\n(1992) standard stars observed during the different runs. For\nsome targets, only short \u223c 60 \u2212 120 sec exposures were obtained during photometric weather conditions. These were\nlater used to calibrate the flux measured in longer exposure frames. This was done by measuring the ratio between\nthe intensities within a \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 wide elliptical aperture of\nboth long and short exposures, or by measuring the intensity ratio for many foreground stars which were used later\nas secondary standard stars to calibrate the galaxy flux.\nWe measure with the ELLIPSE task the B-magnitude\nand colours for an elliptical aperture with the semi-major\naxis as given in the literature (see HyperLEDA, Paturel et\n\n4.1\n\nDust extinction\n\nDark lanes are produced by the absorption and scattering\nof light by dust grains in the dusty structure. These processes depend strongly on the size distribution, structure\nand chemical composition of the grains. The attenuation of\nstarlight by the dust is wavelength-dependent and is often\nreferred to as the \"extinction law\" or \"reddening\".\nIn order to estimate the dust extinction in galaxies\nwhere the dust covering factor is relatively small, a dust-free\nmodel is constructed by fitting the unextinguished parts of\nthe galaxy with an underlying light distribution of a spheroid\nfollowing a S\u00e9rsic profile. This is done by fitting the galaxies\n\n\f6\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\n\nTable 5.

For\nthe chemical composition and the size of the dust grain we\nuse the Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck (1977) two-component\nmodel consisting of individual spherical silicate and graphite\ngrains with an adequate mixture of sizes. The dust mass is\nthen calculated by integrating the dust column density over\nthe image areas S occupied by DLs, yielding (see Finkelman\n\nZa+\n\n4 3\n\u03c0a \u03c1d n (a) da.\n3\n\n(2)\n\na\u2212\n\nwhere a represents a certain grain size; n (a) represents the\nsize distribution of dust grains; a\u2212 and a+ represent the\nlower and upper cutoffs of the size distribution, respectively;\n\u03c1d is the specific grain densities; ld represents the dust column length along the line of sight; and nH is the hydrogen\nnumber density.\nAlthough ld and nH cannot be directly measured from\nour data, the value of the product ld \u00d7 nH can be inferred\nfrom the measured total extinction and by calculating the\nextinction efficiency (Finkelman et al. 2008).

Therefore, estimating the dust mass from total\nextinction values provides only a lower limit to the true dust\ncontent of the host galaxies. We also note that uncertainties\nin the average grain size or in the lower and upper cutoffs\nresult in an uncertainty in dust mass, which can lead to an\nerror of tens of percent, depending on the deviation from\nthe Galactic extinction law.\nAn alternative method for estimating the dust mass is\nbased on the expected far-IR emission of the dust grains. Assuming thermal equilibrium, the relation between the dust\nmass and the observed far-IR flux density, I\u03bd , follows (Hilde-\n\nbrand 1983)\nMd =\n\n4\nI\u03bd\na\u03c1d D2\n3\nQ\u03bd B\u03bd (Td )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1d and D are the specific grain mass density and distance of the galaxy in Mpc (assuming H0 = 72 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 ), respectively; Q\u03bd and B\u03bd (Td ) are the grain emissivity and the Planck function for the temperature Td at\nfrequency \u03bd, respectively. The dust grain temperature can\nbe calculated from\n\u0010 the\u0011IRAS flux densities at 60 \u03bcm and 100\n0.4\n\n60\n(Young et al. 1989).

The quantity a\u03c1d /Q\u03bd can be calculated for\nthe silicate and graphite grains assuming it is independent\nof a for \u03bb \u226b a (see Hilderbrand 1983).\nThese dust mass estimates represent lower limits, since\nIRAS was not sensitive to dust cooler than about 20K, which\nemits mostly at \u03bb > 100 \u03bcm.

For a given electron temperature and density the mass\ncan be written as:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(4)\nMHII = LH\u03b1 mH /ne / 4\u03c0jH\u03b1 /ne np\n\nwhere mH is the mass of the hydrogen atom; ne and np are\nthe number of electrons and protons per cm3 and jH\u03b1 is\nthe emission coefficient of the H\u03b1 line. Assuming an electron temperature of \u223c 104 K the expression above can be\nsimplified as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012 3\nLH\u03b1\n10 cm\u22123\nMHII = 2.33 \u00d7 103\nM\u2299 . (5)\n1039 erg s\u22121\nne\nWe estimate the HII masses assuming a typical electron density of \u223c 103 cm\u22123 (see Goudfrooij et al. 1994a) and list the\nresults in the sixth column of Table 5.\nTo properly derive the H\u03b1 luminosity requires measuring the ratios of the [NII] and H\u03b1 lines, which are not available here. The HII masses are therefore upper limits, while\nthe true values are likely lower by a factor of \u223c 2 \u2212 3 (see\nGoudfrooij et al. 1994a; Macchetto et al. 1996);\n\nmass fraction of the young component. In addition, we allow for a variation of the stellar formation scenario of the\nyounger population, thus our model to fit consists of six independent parameters.\nWhile our observations focus on the optical regime, the\nspectral coverage of most of the objects does not always include the entire U, B, V, R & I broad-band filter set. To\nimprove the wavelength coverage, we retrieve 2MASS J, H\n& Ks band imaging (see Skrutskie et al. 2006) and data from\nSDSS DR7 for the galaxies for which they are available. This\nis done by matching the aperture to that used for our observations and calibrating the data with the formal pipelines.\nThis allows in most instances to determine fully the twocomponent stellar population of the galaxy. The average errors for the photometric calibration are typically 6 0.02 mag\nfor the SDSS and 2MASS observations, 6 0.05 mag for the\nVATT and SAAO observations, and 6 0.10 mag for the WO\nobservations, but may increase after correcting for extinction, most notably for the bluer bands.\nThe best fit to the observed colours is obtained by performing a \u03c72 test by minimizing the following expression:\n\u03c72 = \u03a3i\n\n(colouri,obs \u2212 colouri,mod )2\n.\n\u03c3i2\n\nStar formation histories\n\nIn order to determine the stellar population of each galaxy\nwe fit two-component star formation histories to the galaxy\nderived extinction-corrected colours. The old component,\nthe bulk of the stellar population, is modelled as an instantaneous starburst. We add to this a young component\nrepresented by either an instantaneous burst or an exponentially declining star formation rate with an e-folding time of\n100 Myr (see Schawinsky et al. 2007). By varying these parameters we take into account various star formation histories, including single bursts. The library model colours are\ncalculated based on the simple and complex stellar population generated by the galaxy evolution models (GEMs)\nof Bruzual & Charlot (2003, hereafter BC03). We use the\ndefault models pre-calculated in BC03 using the Padova\n1994 evolutionary tracks and the Salpeter (1955) initial mass\nfunction (IMF) with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 0.1M\u2299\nand 100M\u2299 , respectively. The models calculate spectra and\ngalactic colours at 220 time steps, which range from 0.1\nMyr and 20 Gyr, for six different metallicities in the range\n0.02Z\u2299 < z < 1.5Z\u2299 . Our library of models for each GEM\nis created from linear combinations of two bursts, where the\nvariables are the age and metallicity of each burst and the\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3i is the estimated error for the observed colouri . To\nenhance the fit reliability, the EWH\u03b1 is also derived from the\nmodels. Since BC03 essentially predicts the stellar spectra\nand not the nebular emission lines, we calculate the EWH\u03b1\nfrom the number of ionizing Lyman-continuum (NLyC ) photons predicted by the GEMs. Assuming a simple case B hydrogen recombination theory, the measured H\u03b1 luminosity is\nrelated to the LyC photon flux (Osterbrock 1989) as follows:\nNLyC = 7.43 \u00d7 1011 L (H\u03b1)\n\u22121\n\nwhere L (H\u03b1) is in erg s\n\n(7)\n\n. This leads to\n\nEWH\u03b1 = 1.13 \u00d7 10\u221252\n4.4\n\n9\n\nNLyC\nIR\n\n(8)\n\nwhere IR is calculated from the R-band absolute magnitude computed in the models so as to be consistent with the\nmethod described in \u00a7 3.2. We note that no extinction correction is applied to the observed EWH\u03b1+[NII] values. The\nmodel fitting results are listed in Table 10. In addition, to\nillustrate the agreement between the observations and models we plot in Fig. 3 the observed optical and near-IR colours\nand the EWH\u03b1 vs. the corresponding values obtained from\nthe adopted models.\n4.5\n\nAn example: stellar populations of NGC5363\n\nNGC5363 has by far the most extended spectral coverage among our sample galaxies including sufficiently deep\nGALEX and SST/IRAC observations to measure the flux\nin the IG region. We therefore use this galaxy as an example for our SFH fitting scheme for a case where an optimal\ndata set is available.\nPrevious studies of the stellar population of NGC5363\nassumed that it contains an almost coeval stellar population\nand therefore can be described by a simple stellar population (Denicol\u00f3 et al. 2005; Sansom et al. 2006; Annibali et al.\n2007).

However, the observed optical colours\nare degenerate with respect to the competing stellar population models in the sense that they cannot discriminate\nbetween them.\nOur fitting scheme for NGC5363 included the colours\n[(U-B), (B-R), (r-i), (i-z), (FUV-NUV), (NUV-U), (R-J),\n(J-H), (H-K), (R-3.6\u03bcm), (3.6\u03bcm-4.5\u03bcm)] and the EWH\u03b1\nproduced as described above. The average errors for the\nphotometric calibration of the SST/IRAC magnitudes are\napproximately \u223c 0.01 mag, and for the GALEX FUV and\nNUV magnitudes they are \u223c 0.25 mag and \u223c 0.15 mag,\nrespectively.\nThe old component that best fits this galaxy is an \u223c 8.5\nGyr population with Solar metallicity. This result is reproduced by both the double instantaneous burst scenarios and\nby the early burst followed by an exponential decay scenario,\nwith similar likelihood. However, while both formation scenarios clearly favour the existence of a younger population\nin the IG disk, the double instantenous burst scenario estimates its age at \u223c 12 Myr while the early burst followed by\nan exponential decay scenario estimates a \u223c 81 Myr population. Both scenarios agree that the metallicity of the younger\npopulation is \u223cSolar and that this population constitutes\n\u223c 2% of the overall stellar mass in the galaxy.\nTo verify that our analysis is not biased by the GEM we\n\nadopt, we computed also a similar model library based on\nthe PEGASE GEM (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997). The\nfitted results matches those of BC03, with an old population\nof \u223c 9 Gyr age given by both scenarios, and a young population of \u223c 5 Myr given by the double instantaneous bursts\nscenario and of \u223c 80 Myr given by the instantaneous burst\nfollowed by an exponential decay scenario.\nFig. 4 shows \u03c72 contour map representing the results\nof the \u03c72 minimum fitting with PEGASE (right) and BC03\n(left). The solid lines represent the fitting results to a model\nwith a second instantaneous burst, while the dashed lines\nrepresent the fitting results to a model with a second exponentially decaying burst with an e-folding time of 0.1 Gyr.\nThe \u03c72 minimum is marked with 'x' and we indicate the\n68% (1\u03c3), 95% (2\u03c3) and 99% (3\u03c3) confidence contours. The\nfigure implies that one cannot distingush with confidence\nbetween the two formation scenarios tested.\n\nThe deep GALEX observations also allow the extension of the measurements of the extinction law to the spaceUV region. Fig. 5 shows the NGC5363 extinction law compared with the Galactic, Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC)\nand Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC) extinction laws (see\nGordon et al. 2003).\n\n\fIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes\n\n11\n\nFigure 3.

The dust structures or DLs often lie along axes\ndifferent from those of the stellar body. We identify extended\nDLs along the minor-axis in 10 of the sample galaxies and\nmajor-axis DLs in six galaxies, while in five objects the DL\nappears to lie along intermediate-axes.

H\u03b1 emission was detected here in 25 of the 30\nstudied galaxies. Our sample galaxies typically show an IG\ndistribution characterized by strong central emission surrounded by a weak, extended diffuse emission component\nin the shape of an inclined disk. However, a close inspection of the line-emitting regions reveals differences in size\nand morphology. While the gas morphology appears to be\nrather smooth for most galaxies, some objects show individual knots, clumps and filamentary structures (NGC662,\nNGC3656 and NGC7625) where we detect strong H\u03b1 emission. These features coincide with the DLs and are known\nsites of current star formation believed to be triggered by a\nrecent merger event (see APPENDIX A).\nWe could not detect with confidence H\u03b1 emission in\nfive objects (UGC4449, NGC2968, NGC5311, NGC6314 and\nNGC7432). To check this, we compare our results with data\nfrom the SDSS/DR7 archive. The SDSS spectra, obtained\n\n\fIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes\nFigure 5.

Examining the\ndust and IG distributions shows that in objects where both\ndust and IG are detected, the two components lie in disks\nwith similar inclinations with respect to the galactic plane\n(see figures in APPENDIX A). It is therefore reasonable to\nassume that the extended DLs are, in most cases, projected\ndust disks or rings.\nWe find that the HII disks have mean radii of 3 kpc,\nand that the ratio of their size with respect to the galaxy\nsize has a large scatter (average 0.28 and median 0.22, see\nTable 4). This implies that ionization sources are typically\nrestricted to the inner regions of the galaxy, in agreement\nwith Macchetto et al. (1996) who found that 54% of the Es\nshowed IG disk structures with mean diameters < 4 kpc,\nwhile only 25% of the sample Es had a more extended gas\ndistribution.\n\n5.1.2\n\n5\n\nMass relation\n\nThe relation between the dust and IG components can also\nbe tested quantitatively by searching for a correlation between the mass of dust in the DLs and the estimated IG\nmass.\nOur method for measuring the extragalactic dust extinction restricted its derivation to only 21 of the sample\ngalaxies. The RB values derived in \u00a7 4.1 are close to the\nstandard Galactic value, RB = 4.1, at least for most of the\nderived extinction curves, with a mean value of 4.07 \u00b1 0.35.\nThe characteristic grain size responsible for the optical extinction in these galaxies is therefore similar to that in the\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nlog(Mdust)\n\nMW, as found for a large number of dust-lane E/S0s (Goudfrooij et al. 1994b; Patil et al. 2007; Finkelman et al. 2008).\nUsing the optical extinction values and considering MW-like\ngrains we evaluated the dust mass for each galaxy, and found\nit in the range \u223c 104 to 107 M\u2299 . This is in good agreement\nwith the earlier estimates for E/S0s with dark lanes (see\nFinkelman et al. 2008 and references therein).\nIn addition, we compared dust masses derived using reddening and optical extinction with those using IRAS flux\ndensities and found that the latter are up to one order of\nmagnitude higher than the first, also in agreement with previous studies (see Finkelman et al. 2008). As suggested by\nGoudfrooij & de Jong (1995), this discrepancy may indicate\nthe presence of a large component of diffuse dust distributed\nover the galaxy, or of DLs or dust rings that are optically\nthin in the visible and are located far from the galactic center.\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the logarithm of the dust mass measured within the DLs (not the diffuse component) vs. the\nlogarithm of the IG mass. Although the points are somewhat scattered, the correlation between the two components\nis clear, with a slope of \u223c 0.8. While the H\u03b1 luminosity is\nnot corrected for extinction, the scattering is also likely the\nresult of large uncertainties in estimating the electron densities and the [NII]/H\u03b1 line ratio values, not measured in this\nstudy.\nSince the gas-to-dust ratio in early-type galaxies is typically between a few hundred to a few thousand, the low\nMHII /Md values detected in the IG disks of the sample\ngalaxies imply that most of the gas in the disks is not ionized but in atomic or molecular form, as argued for other\nsuch galaxies by Oosterloo et al. (2002).\n\n\f5.2\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\nIonization mechanisms\n\nThe gas ionization and the distribution of the IG and dust\nwere investigated in many spectroscopic and imaging surveys. However, it seems that the question of what powers\nthe observed nebular emission in early-type galaxies is far\nfrom being solved. The current status of the study of IG in\nE/S0 galaxies suggests a large variety of mechanisms possibly responsible for the ionization in different objects and\nwithin single galaxies (see Macchetto et al. 1996; Sarzi et\nal. 2006; Sarzi et al. 2009). Below we discuss which of the\nmechanisms are likely to account for the apparent ionization\nin our sample galaxies. However, we note that disentangling\nwith confidence the relative importance of these mechanisms\nmay require more detailed observations than reported here,\nand a broader wavelength coverage.\n5.2.1\n\nThe effect of a central AGN\n\nAt least some of the sample galaxies host an active galactic nucleus (AGN; see Table 1). We therefore consider the\npossible effect of non-stellar continuum radiation from an\nAGN on the observed flux of a galaxy. A useful diagnostic\ntool to distinguish between different ionization sources and\nto probe AGN activity is the line-ratio diagram (Baldwin,\nPhillips, & Terlevich 1981; hereinafter BPT).\nExtracting SDSS/DR7 spectroscopic data for the central 3\u2032\u2032 of the galaxies from the publicly available MPA/JHU\ncatalogs we find in most cases line-ratios typical of LINERs\n(Ho 2008; see Fig. 7). In addition, we find that the central\n3\u2032\u2032 H\u03b1 flux measurements do not exceed \u223c 5% percent of the\ntotal emission line flux measured from the total IG aperture.\nWe therefore conclude that, at least for most of the objects,\nthe extended nature of the H\u03b1 line emission implies that\nan AGN, if present, cannot produce the bulk of the ionizing\nflux.\nNuclear emission from an AGN is also expected to affect\nthe observed colours of a galaxy. However, since we cannot\nproperly test this effect in our galaxies, there is no attempt\nhere to correct any of the colours.\n5.2.2\n\nNon-stellar ionization mechanisms\n\nHot gas can, in principle, ionize colder gas through thermal\nconduction (Sparks, Macchetto & Golombek 1989; de Jong\net al. 1990), emission of extreme-UV photons (see O'Connell\n1999 for a review), or by induced shocks (Ford & Butcher\n1979; Heckman et al. 1989). However, the conditions required for these to occur are not consistent with the observations for E/S0s (Sparks et al. 1989; Sarzi et al. (2009).\nIn addition, galaxies with strong X-ray emission do not necessarily show H\u03b1 emission and vice versa (Macchetto et al.\n1996).\nFurthermore, a detailed morphological comparison between X-ray and H\u03b1 emission has only been established for\na small number of E/S0s (Trinchieri & Goudfrooij 2002;\nSparks et al. 2004). The latter revealed highly asymmetric,\nclumpy and filamentary X-ray emission, remarkably similar\nto the IG and dust distribution, which does not resemble\nthe smooth distribution observed in our sample galaxies.\nAn alternative ionization source was suggested by Serra\net al. (2008) in their study of E/S0s with large HI masses.\n\nFigure 7. BPT diagram for the inner 3\u2032\u2032 of our galaxies. The\ndominant ionization source can be distinguished with sufficient\ninformation of the emission-lines, which enables to put the sample galaxies on the BPT diagnostic diagram. The data points\nwere taken from SDSS/DR7 and Ho et al. (1997). The demarcation between ionization by an AGN or starburst is taken from\nKauffmann et al. (2003).\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nlog([OIII]/H\u03b2)\n\n14\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nlog([NII]/H\u03b1)\nThe authors claimed that a low-level residual star formation\nprocess cannot produce the observed LINER-like line ratios,\nand suggested that, at least in some cases, the ionization\ncan be accounted for by the shocks experienced by cold gas\nflowing towards the inner stellar body.\n\n5.2.3\n\nStellar ionization mechanisms\n\nSeveral studies suggested that hot evolved stars provide an\nadequate number of Lyman continuum photons to account\nfor the EW of the H\u03b1 emission line and for the excitation\nof IG in Es (di Serego Alighieri, Trinchieri & Brocato 1990;\nBinette et al. 1994; Macchetto et al. 1996). The tight correlation in E/S0s between the detected emission-line flux and\nthe host galaxy blue luminosity implies that the ionization\nis dominated by a diffuse and old stellar component (Macchetto et al. 1996; Sarzi et al. 2009). Sarzi et al. further\nnoted that in most of their sample galaxies the correlation\nis a result of the IG emission following closely the stellar\nsurface brightness pattern.\nHowever, a young stellar component, even of minor\nmass, is expected to dominate the optical spectrum, thus\nthe observed blue luminosity of the IG region cannot be associated with the host galaxy alone. In addition, in many of\nour objects the extended structures of IG and dust do not\nfollow the stellar surface brightness pattern, arguing against\na correlation between the host galaxy and the source of ionization.\nSeveral studies of photoionization by hot young stars in\nE/S0s found it to be inconsistent with the optical colours\n(Goudfrooij et al. 1994a) and the integrated optical spectra (Sadler 1987; Heckman et al. 1989). However, a grow-\n\n\fIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes\ning line of recent evidence indicates that the presence of a\nyoung population in a significant fraction of E/S0 galaxies cannot be ruled out as previously thought. For instance,\nV\u0131\u0301lchez & Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo (1998) studied a sample of E/S0s\nin compact groups and detected enhanced H\u03b1 emission several times higher than expected from an evolved stellar population, supporting a recent star formation episode. Kaviraj\net al. (2007) and Schawinski et al. (2007) studied large samples of E/S0s with multiwavelength photometry from nearUV to near-IR and found in some galaxies evidence for current star formation contributing \u223c 1 \u2212 10% of the current\nstellar mass in these galaxies.\nFurthermore, a group of galaxies within the SAURON\nsample (de Zeeuw et al. 2002) shows extremely low\n[OIII]/H\u03b2 values and settled gaseous disks where on-going\nstar formation is occurring (Sarzi et al. 2006, 2009). These\nobjects, which constitute 4% of the sample, are characterized by regular disk-like gas distributions and by very regular and circularly symmetric DLs. Studies of cold gas content (Combes, Young & Bureau 2007) and PAH emission\n(Shapiro et al. 2009) in the SAURON sample suggested that\nthe low-level star formation in E/S0s may actually be even\nmore frequent than suggested by Sarzi et al. (2009).\n\n5.3\n\nThe stellar population\n\nThe observational evidence discussed above indicates that\nthe ionization of gas is probably dominated by stellar\nsources, although its nature is still debated. The [NII]/H\u03b1\nvalues of \u223c 1, together with the low EWH\u03b1 . 3\u00c5 measured\nfor some of our sample galaxies in SDSS/DR7, indicate that\nan old stellar population, rather than a current star formation episode, is more likely to dominate the ionization in the\ninner part of the galaxies (see Cid Fernandez et al. 2009).\nHowever, assuming [NII]/H\u03b1 \u223c 1 we find EWH\u03b1 > 3\u00c5 for\nthe total extended line emission. This result implies that the\npower of ionization with respect to the underlying galaxy is\nstronger on average than in the central galactic region.\nFitting our data with stellar population models clearly\nindicates the presence of a small fraction of a young population linked with the IG region, while the bulk of the stellar\ncomponent consists of a significantly older population. Such\na late low-level star formation episode in E/S0s was also\nfound in previous studies (e.g., Kaviraj et al. 2007; Schawinski et al. 2007).\nHowever, we cannot determine with confidence the age\nof the young population, since our fitting scheme for a secondary population produces similar minimal \u03c72 values for\nthe two adopted scenarios (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). An instantaneous burst would have produced a population of \u223c 1 \u2212 10\nMyr, while an exponentially-decaying star formation process, with an e-folding time of 100 Myr, would have produced a population ten times older (\u223c 10 \u2212 100 Myr). While\nfor most galaxies this uncertainty may be explained by the\nrestricted spectral coverage, which may be insufficient to\nfully constrain the models, we show that similar results are\nobtained for NGC5363 where deep UV and near-IR observations were combined with the optical information. This\nemphasizes the need to identify an observational parameter\nthat could distinguish between the alternatives.\n\n15\n\nIn addition, we use the Maraston (2005)2 models to calculate the number of Lyman continuum photons and the expected EWH\u03b1 values for a stellar population evolving from\nan instantenous burst. The Maraston et al. models account\nfor the late evolutionary stages of stars which has significant influence on the flux of \u223c 1Gyr old stellar population\n(Maraston et al. 2005). Comparing our measurements with\nthe model predictions indicates, in agreement with the BC03\nfitting, the presence of a young \u223c 10Myr stellar population.\nWhile the detection of a younger population seems real,\nthe relatively young age of \u223c 1 \u2212 5 Gyr found for the old\ncomponent in some of the galaxies is somewhat suspicious.\nThis can be explained if the intrinsic stellar population of\nthe galaxies does not follow the assumed model. Due to the\nobservational limitations we cannot rule out the presence of\na third population of \u223c 10 Myr stars within the gaseous\ndisks or, alternatively, a more complex continuous star formation scenario.\n5.4\n\nThe case of NGC5363\n\nPerhaps more puzzling is the discovery of a new and relatively rare class of Es with tightly wound star-forming spiral\narms. Known examples in the literature include NGC5128,\nIC1459 (Goudfrooij et al. 1990), NGC5173 (see Vader &\nVigroux 1990) and NGC3108 (Hau et al. 2008). IG in a\nloosely-wound spiral feature, similar to an integral sign, was\nalso found in four of the SAURON sample galaxies (Sarzi et\nal. 2009).\nNGC5363 is a known LINER and a strong radio galaxy\nwhich belongs to a group of seven galaxies (Garcia 1993).\nCarefully examining the continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII]\nimage of NGC5363, we note that the spatial distribution\nof the HII regions also resembles a barred spiral. The colour\nmap in Fig. A6 clearly shows the heavily obscured inner bar\nto be part of a more complex dust structure that follows the\nspiral structure and extends further along the major axis.\nMorphologically, the NGC5363 dust structure bears some\nresemblance to NGC5128, a prototype minor-axis dust-lane\nE, which appears as a barred spiral residing inside an elliptical (Mirabel et al. 1999).\nThe NGC5363 extinction law does not show a strong\n2174\u00c5 bump, but is otherwise in agreement with the MW\nextinction law (see Fig. 5). The 2174\u00c5 bump is generally\nbelieved to be linked with the presence of PAH particles\n(Li & Greenberg 2003), and although its absence may imply a low graphite abundance compared to that of the\nMW dust grains, the detection of near-IR dust emission in\nNGC5363 supports the presence of such particles (Pahre et\nal. 2004). Therefore, if the dust particles within the dust\ndisk of NGC5363 are truly similar to those in the MW, then\nthis deviation in the near-UV might be the consequence of\nthe spectral coverage of the GALEX NUV band. The NUV\nband is much broader than the 2174\u00c5 feature width and\ntherefore transmits photons at longer wavelength, where the\nextinction is significantly lower.\nAnalysis of SST/IRAC images shows that the stellar\nbody of NGC5363 matches a model consisting of a de Vaucouleurs bulge plus an exponential disk (Pahre et al. 2004).\n2\n\nhttp://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/ maraston\n\n\f16\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\n\nThe spiral-like spatial distribution shown by the 8.0\u03bcm image does not follow the stellar 3.6\u03bcm emission indicating\nthat most of the 8.0\u03bcm emission is probably non-stellar.\nThis also indicates that the dust is not produced by stellar\nmass loss from an AGB population (see also Shapiro et al.\n2009), implying that internal mechanisms could not account\nfor the observed dust mass (Patil et al. 2007). These findings, combined with the existence of shells and CO emission\n(Sanders & Mirabel 1985) and the orthogonal angular momentum of the gas and stars (Sharples et al. 1983), suggest\nthat this galaxy is the result of an interaction with another\ngalaxy by either accretion or merger, and provide strong\nevidence for the external origin of the ISM in NGC5363\nThe extended 8.0\u03bcm emission, which perfectly coincides\nwith the HII emission, rules out a significant contribution\nof non-stellar continuum emission from an AGN. The close\nrelation between the 8.0\u03bcm emission and the distribution of\nthe IG and dust implies that the near-IR non-stellar emission\nmay be dominated by PAH features. The UV radiation field\nrequired for the PAH excitation could be produced by a\nrecent star formation event (Peeters, Spoon & Tielens 2004;\nWu et al. 2005) or by post-AGB stars and planetary nabulae\n(Peeters et al. 2002).\nThe [NUV-r] colour of NGC5363, 5.40 \u00b1 0.15, is only\nmarginally consistent with a recent star formation episode\n(Kaviraj et al. 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez & Bruzual 2009) suggesting that UV colours alone may not indicate with confidence\nthe presence of a young population. In order to examine the\ncontribution of evolved stars, we measure the near-IR flux,\nwhere these stars are expected to dominate the spectrum,\nand compare the [3.6 \u2212 4.5] = \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.02 colour, measured within the IG region, with the expected values from\nthe Maraston et al. (2005) models. We conclude that this\nvalue can be accounted for by the presence of a \u223cMyr stellar population with a Solar-like metallicity, and not by an\nold population alone. For lower metallicities, the age determination is less decisive due to the minor variation of the\n[3.6-4.5] colour with age.\nFurthermore, fitting the UV to near-IR colours and the\ndetected H\u03b1 emission with the GEMs indicates the presence\nof a young stellar population in NGC5363, which constitutes\na few percent of the mass of the galaxy. We therefore conclude that it is highly likely that this galaxy experienced a\nrecent star formation episode triggered by accretion of external material.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe reported the properties of dust and ionized gas in a sample of 30 dust-lane E/S0 galaxies based on multicolour and\nH\u03b1 narrow-band imaging observations. For most galaxies,\nextended physically-associated dust and ionized gas structures are observed. The correlation between the dust and\nionized gas is further illustrated by the correlation between\nthe masses of these two components.\nThe extragalactic extinction law by the dust in the sample galaxies indicates similar properties to those canonical\nGalactic grains. This property is used to correct the flux\nmeasured within the ionized gas aperture for galactic extinction. The derived colours and H\u03b1 fluxes are fitted with\nstellar population synthesis models, with results indicating\n\nthe presence of a small fraction of \u223c 10 \u2212 100 Myr old stars\nwithin the old stellar bulge.\nWe also discussed in detail the case of NGC5363 where\nwe detected a unique spiral-like gas and dust distribution.\nThe ISM characteristics combined with the wide spectral\ncoverage available for this galaxy further support the late\nstar-forming episode often observed in E/S0s.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the anonymous referee for providing constructive\ncomments and help improving the content of this paper.\nIF wishes to thank Hagai Netzer, Oded Spector and Benny\nTrakhtenbrot for many useful discussions.

In\naddition we present in Figures A1-A8 a R-band contour\nmap image, a continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] narrow-band\nimage and a B-R colour image for each galaxy. The images\ncorrespond to the inner regions of the galaxies and are\ntypically \u223c 45\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 45\u2032\u2032 .\nIC 1575. This elliptical galaxy has an apparent DL along\nthe minor axis and stellar shells in the direction of the\nmajor axis. It was included in a study of the optical\nand morphology of elliptical DL galaxies (M\u00f6llenhoff et\nal. 1992). While the minor-axis DL may be an inclined\ndust disk, the colour image also reveals the presence of\nan off-center DL which is not aligned with either the\nminor or major axes but is at \u223c 30\u25e6 . As shown by the\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image, the extended IG\nregion follows the central dusty disk.\nNGC662. This galaxy is classified S peculiar in the RC3\ncatalog. The colour and H\u03b1+[NII] images show patches\nof dust which coincide with the line emission. Very weak\nradio emission was detected by Gregorini et al. (1989). This\ngalaxy was included in a search for molecular gas in Es\nwith DLs where 1.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 of cold molecular hydrogen\ngas were detected (Wang et al. 1992).\nESO 477-7. This galaxy is classified S0 in RC3. The\ncolour image shows an inner dust disk surrounded by\nan asymmetric and more diffuse dust structure. The\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an inclined\nextended disk \u223corthogonal to the stellar isophotes.\nNGC708. This E2 galaxy is the brightest in the Abell 262\ncluster. The object shows two orthogonal gaseous components with similar masses and a total mass of 3.2 \u00d7 104 M\u2299\n(Plana & Boulesteix 1997). The continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] image shows an inclined disk which follows the\ndust component.\n\n\fIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust lanes\nESO 197-10. This E galaxy has a strong minor-axis\nDL which is likely a dust disk observed edge-on. The\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image shows an extended\nIG disk with a diffuse faint structure that follows the DL.\nESO 355-8. The colour image of this S0 galaxy shows a\nstrong intermediate DL which may represent an edge-on\ndisk lying in the same plane as the IG disk.\nNGC 1199. This E galaxy is the brightest in a small\ngroup of galaxies. Its colour image reveals a barely resolved\ninner structure of a circumnuclear dust disk surrounded by\na ring, where both components are aligned with the major\naxis. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image shows\nan extended disk-like structure which follows the stellar\nisophotes.\nNGC 1297. This galaxy shows a faint outer envelope\nwhich classifies it as an S0 in RC3. The derived colour\nmap show a complex dust structure consisting of an inner\ncircumnuclear disk with several concentric arcs along the\nminor axis. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image\nshows the IG as an inclined extended disk along the minor\naxis.\nESO 118-19. This S0 galaxy has a strong DL along its\nminor axis. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image\nreveals an inclined IG disk which follows the dust structure.\nNGC 2534. This E1 galaxy was part of a study of molecular gas in E galaxies with DLs by Wang et al. (1992), where\n109 \u00d7M\u2299 of cold molecular hydrogen gas were detected. The\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals a gaseous\ndisk inclined with respect to the galactic plane, with its\nlong axis along the observed minor axis of the galaxy.\nThe apparent lack of emission at the center of the galaxy\nin the continuum-subtracted image is likely the result of\na problematic PSF matching of the H\u03b1+[NII] and the\nR-band images. The colour image reveals a circumnuclear\ndisk surrounded by a dusty arc. The arc might be part of\nan inclined dust ring/disk which follows the IG distribution\nto its detection limit.\nUGC4449. This galaxy shows an apparent DL along the\nminor axis of its inner body. Extended outer shells are\npresent in the direction of the minor axis. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image does not show an extended\nstructure and we did not detect significant line emission at\nthe center of the galaxy.\nNGC2968. The colour image shows a strong DL along\nthe minor axis of the galaxy, which may account for the\napparent rotation of the inner isophotes with respect to\nthe outer isophotes. While Gregorini et al. (1989) reported\nthat the DL is confined to the inner part of the galaxy, the\ncolour image clearly shows it following the luminous body\nalmost to the detection limit. The continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] image does not show an extended structure and\nwe did not detect significant line emission in the center of\nthe galaxy.\nMrk33. This elliptical blue compact galaxy is known to\ncontain dust and a conspicuous central star formation\nregion (Davidge 1989). The colour image shows that the\ngalaxy is extremely blue at its center and increasingly\nredder outwards. The off-center dust patches reported by\nM\u00f6llenhoff et al. (1992) are not seen in our images. H\u03b1\nimaging by M\u00e9ndez & Esteban (2000) showed the presence\nof at least three star-forming knots in the center of the\ngalaxy. These are not resolved in the disk shown in our\n\n19\n\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image. Summers, Stevens\n& Strickland (2001) suggested that the colour gradient\nand the distinct discontinuities in the stellar luminosity\nfunction of Mrk33 are evidence for multiple episodes of\nintense star-formation in the history of the galaxy.\nUGC5814. This E galaxy has a major-axis DL. The\nR-band reveals distorted outer isophotes and outer shells\nwith a minor axis perpendicular to that of the stellar body.\nThe continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an IG\ndisk which follows the dust component.\nNGC 3656. This peculiar galaxy shows nearly circular\nshells. The colour map reveals a minor DL with filaments\nextending towards the shells. The continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an inclined gaseous disk with\nfilaments and clumps, which coincide with the dust morphology and are known sites of on-going star formation\nwith a total rate of \u223c 0.1M\u2299 yr\u22121 (M\u00f6llenhoff et al. 1992;\nBalcells 1997). HI VLA observations reveal an edge-on,\nwarped, minor axis HI disk with a mass of \u223c 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\nextending up to 7 kpc from the center (see also Wang et al.\n1992). Balcells (1997) reported the discovery of two tidal\ntails, with a dwarf galaxy lying in one of the tails, and\nsuggested that a disk-disk major merger scenario is more\nlikely to account for the observed morphology than a minor\nmerger. HI gas is also found outside the optical images in\nthe two tails and in the shell (Balcells et al. 2001).\nNGC 3665. The colour image of this E galaxy reveals\na \u223ckpc wide dust ring along its major axis. The apparent colour variation along the dust ring is probably an\ninclination effect where the more distant part of the ring\nobscures less starlight and therefore appears bluer. The IG\nstructure revealed by the continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII]\nimage clearly shows an extended disk which becomes more\nluminous towards its center and which follows precisely the\ndust morphology. Radio observations reveal a continuum\nradio source with an elongated structure with the major\naxis nearly perpendicular to the DL (Kotanyi 1979).\nNGC 4370. This galaxy is known to host of a multiphase\nISM (see Huchtmeier & Richter 1988; Bettoni, Galletta &\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo 2003; Caldwell, Rose & Concannon 2003;\nPatil et al. 2009). The presence of a prominent DL along\nits major axis hinders the determination of its underlying\nmorphological classification; it is classified S0 in Binggeli,\nSandage & Tammann (1985) and Sa in the RC3 catalog.\nThe colour image reveals a major axis DL of a few kpc. The\nDL may be a disk observed edge-on, although the apparent\nbluer regions in its central parts are more suggestive of a\nring-like structure. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII]\nimage reveals a weak clumpy disk, possibly due to the\nheavily obscuring edge-on disk/ring. It is possible that the\ngaseous structure extends out to the limit of the DL, as\nobserved in other galaxies, but its luminosity is too faint to\ndetect due to the extinction.\nNGC 4374. This E1 galaxy is a strong radio continuum source. The colour image reveals a red core with\na slightly bluer surrounding region, which implies a circumnuclear dust disk denser towards the center. The\ncontinuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals a distorted\nIG structure, possibly a warped gaseous disk, which extends\nto the DL limit. The images imply that the DL and the\ngaseous disk do not lie on either the apparent long or short\naxes. HST images show two DLs within the central 5\" of the\n\n\f20\n\nIdo Finkelman et al.\n\ngalaxy oriented roughly parallel to a filamentary H\u03b1+[NII]\nemission of similar size (Bower et al. 1997). In addition,\nseveral studies reported no detection of HI or CO emission\n(Huchtmeier 1994, Knapp & Ruppen 1996, Combes et al.\n2007).\nNGC 4583. Although not apparent in the colour image, this galaxy has a minor axis DL which is revealed\nwhen fitting ellipse models to the broad-band images and\nsubtracting these from the actual images. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an IG disk-like structure\nwhich follows the DL morphology.\nNGC5249. The colour image of this galaxy shows an\ninner dust structure of a central disk surrounded by an arc,\nwhich might be a part of an inclined ring. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an inner IG disk which\ncoincides with the dust disk.\nNGC5311. This galaxy is classified S0 in the RC3 catalog.\nThe colour image clearly reveals a circumnuclear dust\ndisk surrounded by a dust ring. The continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] image shows traces of central line emission, but\nthe weak emission is below our detection limit, thus we\ncannot confirm the presence of an inner IG disk.\nNGC 5485. This galaxy is classified S0 in the HyperLEDA\ncatalog. The colour image reveals a minor axis DL which\nmight be a dust disk/ring observed edge-on and is better\nshown by the model-subtracted image. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image reveals an inclined IG disk\nwhich follows the DL.\nNGC 6251. This giant E2 hosts a powerful radio source.\nWhile our colour image reveals a core slightly redder\nthan its surroundings, implying the presence of dust, HST\nobservations clearly reveal the presence of a well-defined\nnuclear disk of gas and dust (see Ferrarese & Ford 1999).\nOur dust mass estimation, based on the HST images that\nhave better spatial resolution, is in agreement with the\nresult by Ferrarese & Ford (1999).\nNGC6314. The colour image of this galaxy shows a strong\nDL which might be part of an ring in addition to a compact\ninner dust disk. As implied by the continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] image we could not detect significant amounts of\nIG in this galaxy.\nNGC 6702. This is an E3 galaxy. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image shows an inclined disk with its\nmajor axis along the galaxy minor axis. The colour image\nreveals a thin DL extending towards the IG disk limit.\nNGC 7052. This galaxy is classified as an E4 radio galaxy\nfeaturing a core and jet, but no lobes (Morganti et al. 1987),\nand its dusty disk physical properties were discussed in the\nliterature (Nieto et al. 1990; de Juan, Colina & Golombek\n1996). The colour image reveals a circumnuclear DL along\nthe galaxy major axis. The continuum-subtracted H\u03b1+[NII]\nimage shows an IG disk following the dust structure. The\ndetailed structure of the nuclear gas and dust disk as\nobserved by HST are also discussed in van der Marel & van\nden Bosch (1998; see their Fig. 1).\nNGC7399. The colour and continuum-subtracted\nH\u03b1+[NII] images show an inclined disk of dust and\nIG along the major axis of the galaxy.\nNGC7432. Although small amounts of dust were found\nin the inner part of this galaxy by Patil et al. (2007) and\nGregorini et al. (1989), we could not detect significant\namounts of dust or IG in our images.\n\nNGC 7625. This galaxy is considered by some authors\nto belong to the polar-ring galaxy type (Whitmore et al.\n1990) and its morphology is considered to be an extended\nblue compact galaxy (Cair\u00f3s et al. 2001). The colour image\nshows a complex structure with multiple DLs and that\nthe galaxy is bluer in its northern part. The continuumsubtracted H\u03b1+[NII] image shows that the line emission\nis concentrated in a central disk surrounded by several\nHII regions (see Cair\u00f3s et al. 2001; Martinez-Delgado et\nal. 2007). The HII clumps are mostly spread along two\nantennae-like structure, which can be interpreted as signs\nof recent interaction. The HII filamentary structure clearly\ncoincides with the DLs.\n\n\f40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\narcsec\n\narcsec\n\nIonized gas in E/S0 galaxies with dust
