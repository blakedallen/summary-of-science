Computational advantages [26, 14] of quantum computers with many qubits have received the most attention but are difficult to\nimplement physically. On the other hand, technology for manipulating and\ncommunicating just a few qubits could be sufficient to create new economic\nmechanisms by altering the information security and strategic incentives of\nthe underlying game.\nExamples of quantum mechanisms include the prisoner's dilemma [10,\n11, 7, 8], coordination [17, 21] and public goods provisioning [3]. In particular, a quantum mechanism can significantly reduce the free-rider problem\nwithout a third-party enforcer or repeated interactions, both in theory and\npractice [2].\nIn this paper, we examine quantum mechanisms for another economic\nscenario: resource allocation by auction [28]. While traditional auction\nmechanisms can efficiently allocate resources in many cases, quantum auction protocols offer improvements in preserving privacy of the losing bids\nand dealing with scenarios in which bidders care about what other bidders\nwin when multiple items are auctioned. Specifically, using quantum superpositions to represent bids prevents the auctioneer and other bidders from\nviewing the bids during the auction without disrupting the auction process.\nFurthermore, the auction result reveals nothing but the winning bid and\nallocation.\nThe first part of the paper introduces a general quantum auction protocol\nfor various pricing and allocation rules, multiple unit auctions, combinatorial\nauctions and partnership bids. For simplicity, we focus on the sealed-bid\nfirst-price auction. In this auction, each bidder has one opportunity to\nsubmit a bid. The winner is the highest bidder, who pays the amount bid\nfor the item. This auction has been well studied both theoretically [28] and\nexperimentally [5, 4], and contrasts with iterative auctions in which bidders\ncan incrementally increase their bids depending on how others bid.\nIf the auction is not well-matched to the bidders preferences, it can introduce perverse incentives and result in poor outcomes, such as lost revenue\nfor the seller or economically inefficient allocations where items are not allocated to those who value them most. Thus it is important to examine\nincentives introduced with a proposed auction design. In particular, our\nauction protocol involves quantum search, which introduces incentive issues\n2\n\n\fbeyond those examined in prior quantum games [11].\nA full analysis of incentive issues is complicated, even for classical auctions. In this paper we focus on two incentive issues arising from the quantum auction protocol. The first incentive issue arises from the possibility\nof manipulating the search outcome by altering amplitudes associated with\ndifferent bids. We show how to revise an adiabatic search method to correct\nthis incentive problem, thereby preserving the classical Nash equilibrium.\nFrom a quantum algorithm perspective, this construction of the search illustrates how incentive issues affect algorithm design, in contrast to the\nmore common concern with computational efficiency in quantum information processing.\nSecond, the quantum search for the highest bid is probabilistic, i.e., does\nnot always return the highest bid. While the probability of finding the\ncorrect answer can be made as high as one wishes by using more iterations\nof the search, the small residue probability of awarding the item to someone\nother than the highest bidder may change bidding behavior. As a step\ntoward addressing the effect of probabilistic outcomes, we show that, with\nsufficient steps in the quantum search, altering choices from those of the\ncorresponding deterministic auction gives at most a small improvement for\nthat bidder.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 describes the quantum auction\nand the bidding language encoding bids in quantum states. Sec. 3 describes\nthe quantum search method to find the maximum bid. After these sections\ndescribing the auction protocol, in Sec. 4 we turn to strategic issues raised\nby the quantum nature of the auction beyond those in the corresponding\nclassical auctions. Then, in Sec. 5 we give a game theory analysis of some\nof these strategic possibilities and describe how simple modifications of the\nquantum search improves the auction outcome, in theory. Sec. 6 generalizes\nthe results to auctions of multiple items, including combinatorial auctions.\nSec. 7 describes scenarios for which the quantum protocol offers likely economic advantages in terms of information security and ability to compactly\nexpress complex dependencies among items and bidders. Finally, Sec. 8 summarizes the quantum auction protocol and highlights a number of remaining\neconomic questions.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nQuantum Auction Protocol\n\nIn our auction protocol, each bidder selects an operator that produces the desired bid from a prespecified initial state. The auctioneer repeatedly asks the\nbidders to apply their individual operators in a distributed implementation\nof a quantum search to find the winning bid. More specifically, the quantum\nauction protocol for sealed-bid auctions involves the following steps:\n1. Auctioneer announces conventional aspects of the auction: type of\nauction (e.g., first or second price and any reservation prices), the\ngood(s) for sale, the allowed price granularity (e.g., if bids can specify\nvalues to the penny, or only to the dollar), and the criterion used to\ndetermine the winner(s), e.g., maximizing revenue for the seller\n2. Auctioneer announces how quantum states will be interpreted, i.e., as\nspecifying a price if only one good is for sale, or a combination of price\nand a set of goods if combinations are for sale; and also announces\nthe initial quantum state. This state uses p qubits for each bidder.\nAuctioneer announces the quantum search procedure.\n3. Each bidder selects an operator on p qubits. Bidders keep their choice\nof operator private.\n4. Auctioneer produces a set of particles implementing p qubits for each\nbidder, initializing the set to the announced initial state.\n5. Auctioneer and bidders perform a distributed search for the winner\nFig. 1 illustrates this procedure for two bidders and repeating the steps\nof the search twice. Realistic search involves a larger number of steps. In\ncontrast with other quantum games, e.g., public goods, that involve just\none round of interaction, the search required to identify the winners involves\nmultiple rounds of interaction among the participants. The required number\nof iterations depends on the search method. In practice, the auctioneer could\npick the number of iterations based on prior experience with similar auctions,\nor from simulating several test cases using valuations randomly drawn from\na plausible distribution of values for the auction items. Alternatively, the\nauctioneer could repeat the procedure several times (possibly with steps\nfrom each repetition interleaved in a random order) and use the best result\nfrom these repetitions.\n\n4\n\n\fstart\nauctioneer\n\nbidder 1\n\nbidder 2\n\nauctioneer\n\nbidder 1\n\nbidder 2\n\nauctioneer\n\nmeasure state\nannounce result\n\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram of distributed search procedure, showing repeated interactions between auctioneer and bidders, in this case two bidders\nand two steps of the distributed search.\n\n5\n\n\fnumber of bidders\nnumber of items in auction\nnumber of qubits per bidder\nstate of qubits for bidder j\nstate of all qubits\n\nn\nm\np\n\u03c8j\n\u03a8 = \u03c81 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c8n\n\nTable 1: Notation for the quantum auction.\nThis auction protocol uses a distributed search so bidders' operator\nchoices remain private. Specifically, the search operation requiring input\nfrom the bidders is applied locally by each bidder, giving the overall operator\nU = U1 \u2297 U2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Un\n(1)\nwhere n is the number of bidders and Ui the operator of bidder i.\n\n3\n\nQuantum Auction Implementation\n\nA quantum auction requires finding the winning bid and corresponding bidder. This procedure has two components: the interpretation of the qubits\nas bids, and the search procedure to find the winner. The following two subsections discuss these components in the context of a single-item auction.\nSec. 6 generalizes this discussion to multiple items.\n\n3.1\n\nCreation and interpretation of quantum bids\n\nWe define a bid as the amount a bidder indicates he is willing to pay for\nthe item. An allocation is a list of bids, one from each bidder. The quantum auction protocol manipulates superpositions of allocations. We use an\nallocation rule to indicate how allocations specify a winner and amount paid.\nExample 1. Consider an auction of one item with three bidders, willing to\npay $1, $3 and $10 for the item, respectively. We represent these bids as\n|$1i, |$3i and |$10i, and the corresponding allocation as the product of these\nstates, i.e., |$1, $3, $10i with the ordering in the allocation understood to\ncorrespond to the bidders. A simple allocation rule selects the highest bidder\nas the winner, who pays the high bid. In this example, this rule results in\nthe third bidder winning, and paying $10 for the item.\n6\n\n\fEach bidder gets p qubits and can only operate on those bits. Thus each\nbidder has 2p possible bid values, and can create superpositions of these\nvalues. A superposition of bids specifies set of distinct bids, with at most\none allowed to win. The amplitudes of the superposition affect the likelihood\nof various outcomes for the auction. For a single-item auction, a bidder\nwill typically have only one bid. As discussed below, more complicated\nsuperpositions are useful for information hiding. Specifically, bidder j selects\nan operator Uj on p qubits to apply to the initial state for that bidder's\nqubits \u03c8init specified by the auctioneer. The resulting\nstate, \u03c8j = Uj \u03c8init ,\nE\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\nwhere bi is bidder j's\nis a superposition of bids, each of the form bi\nbid for the item. The subscript i indicates one of the possible bids that can\nbe specified with p qubits according to the announced interpretation of the\nbits.\n\nWe define the subspace used by bidder j as the set of states spanned by\nthe basis eigenvectors in \u03c8j . Only these basis vectors appear in allocations\nrelevant for the search. As bidders apply their operators during the search,\nthe superposition of allocations remains within the subspace of each bidder.\nIn this case, where each bidder applies an operator only to their own qubits,\nthe superposition of allocations is always a factored form, i.e., \u03a8 = \u03c81 \u2297\n. . . \u2297 \u03c8n . More generally, groups of bidders could operate jointly on their\nqubits, entangling their bids in the allocations as discussed in Sec. 7.\nTo exploit information hiding properties of superpositions, the state revealed at the end of the search should specify only the bidder who wins the\nitem and the corresponding bid. To achieve this, instead of a direct representation of bids, we interpret bids formed from the p qubits available to a\nbidder as containing a special null value, \u2205, indicating a bid for nothing.\nThis null bid has additional benefits in multiple item settings, as discussed\nin Sec. 6 and Sec. 7.\nExample 2. Consider bidder j with two qubits and the initial state \u03c8init =\n|00i corresponding to the vector (1, 0, 0, 0), which is interpreted as the null\nbid. The other bid states are |01i, |10i and |11i corresponding to vectors\n(0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1). These three states are interpreted as three\nbid values in some preannounced way, e.g., $1, $2 and $3, respectively.\nThe operator\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 1\n0\n1 0\n1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \u22121 0 \uf8f8\n1 0 \u22121\n\n1\n1 \uf8ec\n0\nUj = \u221a \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n2 1\n0\n7\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u221a\ngives the initial state \u03c8j = Uj \u03c8init as (|00i+|10i)/ 2 and specifies the search\nsubspace whose basis is the first and third columns of Uj in this example.\nThus the possible allocations involve only |00i and |10i for this bidder, corresponding to the null bid and a bid of $2, respectively.\nIn the presence of a null bid, we consider an allocation to be a feasible\nif it contains exactly one bid not equal to \u2205. The corresponding allocation\nrule assigns no winner to infeasible allocations and, for feasible allocations,\nthe winner is the single bidder in the allocation whose bid is not \u2205, and he\npays the amount bid. This allocation rule corresponds to a first-price singleitem auction, except there can be no winner, analogous to the situation in\nauctions with a reservation price when no bidder exceeds that price.\n\n3.2\n\nDistributed Search\n\nThe auctioneer must find the best state according to an announced criterion, e.g., maximum revenue. Specifically, the auctioneer has a evaluation\nfunction F assigning a quality value to each allocation. The function F\nassigns a lower value to infeasible allocations than to any feasible one. An\nexample is F equal to the revenue produced by the allocation (if feasible)\nand otherwise is \u22121.\n\nThe auctioneer uses quantum search to find the allocation in the subspace\nselected by the bidders giving the maximum value for F (e.g., a feasible\nallocation giving the most revenue to the auctioneer). This could be done via\nrepeated uses of a decision-problem quantum search [14, 1] as a subroutine\nwithin a search for the minimum threshold value of F giving a solution to the\ndecision problem, e.g., with a classical binary search on threshold values or\nusing results of prior iterations of the decision problem [9]. Alternatively, we\ncould use a method giving the maximum value directly (e.g., adiabatic [12]\nif run for a sufficiently long time or heuristic methods [15, 16] based on some\nprior knowledge of the distribution of bidders values). For definiteness, we\nfocus on the adiabatic method.\nThe adiabatic search is conventionally described as searching for the\nminimum cost state. We use this convention by defining a state's cost to be\nthe negative of the evaluation function F . The adiabatic search procedure,\nif run sufficiently slowly, changes the initial superposition into a final superposition in such a way that the amplitude in each initial eigenstate maps\nto the same amplitude in the corresponding final eigenstate, up to a phase\nfactor (for nondegenerate eigenstates). We refer to this mapping of initial\n8\n\n\fto final eigenstates as a perfect search. In practice, with a finite time for\nthe search, there will be some transfer of amplitude among the eigenstates\nso the search will not be perfect in the sense defined here. Instead the auction outcome is probabilistic: the auction will not always produce the best\noutcome when starting from the ground state. For example, an auction intending to find the highest bid could sometimes produce the second highest\nbid instead. Conventionally, the search operations are chosen so the uniform\nsuperposition is the lowest cost initial eigenstate. In our case, bidders are\nfree to choose their operators and need not create uniform superpositions.\nA discrete implementation of adiabatic search consists of the following\nsteps:\n\u2022 The auctioneer selects a number of search steps S and parameter \u2206.\nThese need not be announced to the bidders.\n\u2022 The auctioneer initializes the state of all np qubits to \u03a8init = \u03c8init \u2297\n. . . \u2297 \u03c8init = |0, . . . , 0i, with n factors of \u03c8init in the product, and\n\u03c8init = |0i is the initial state for the p qubits for a single bidder.\n\u2022 The auctioneer sends these initialized qubits to the bidders who use\ntheir individual operators and then return the qubits to the auctioneer,\njointly creating the state\n\u03a80 = U \u03a8init\n\n(3)\n\n\u2022 For s = 1, . . . , S, the auctioneer and bidders update the state to\n\u03a8s = U D(f )U \u2020 P (f )\u03a8s\u22121\n\n(4)\n\nwith f = s/S the fraction of steps completed. The bid operator U and\nits adjoint U \u2020 are performed by sending bits to the bidders as described\nin Sec. 2. The diagonal matrices D(f ) and P (f ) are described below.\n\u2022 The auctioneer measures the state \u03a8S , resulting in specific values for\nall the bits, from which the winner and prices are determined by the\nallocation rule described in Sec. 3.1.\nThe diagonal matrix P (f ) adjusts the phases of the amplitudes according\nto the cost associated with each allocation. In particular, using the cost\nc(x) = \u2212F (x) for allocation |xi, we have\nPxx (f ) = exp (\u2212if c(x)\u2206)\n9\n\n(5)\n\n\fSimilarly, the diagonal matrix D(f ) adjusts amplitude phases as defined by\na function d(x):\nDxx (f ) = exp (\u2212i(1 \u2212 f )d(x)\u2206)\n(6)\nThe key property of d(x) is assigning the smallest value, e.g., 0, to |0i,\nthereby making the first column of U the ground state eigenvector. Aside\nfrom this key property, the choice of d(x) is somewhat arbitrary. The conventional choice in the adiabatic method uses the Hamming weight of the\nstate, i.e., d(x) equal to the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of\nx. However, as described in Sec. 5, other choices for d(x) can improve the\nincentive properties of the auction.\nThe discrete-step implementation of the continuous adiabatic method [12]\ninvolves the limits \u2206 \u2192 0 and S\u2206 \u2192 \u221e, in which case the final state \u03c8S\nhas high probability to be the lowest cost state. In practice, this outcome\ncan often be achieved with considerably fewer steps using a fixed value of\n\u2206, corresponding to a discrete version of the adiabatic method [16].\n\n4\n\nStrategies with Quantum Operators\n\nIdeally, an auction achieves the economic objective of its design (e.g. maximum revenue for the seller). In practice, an auction design may not provide\nincentives for participants to behave so as to achieve this objective. Usually auction designs are examined under the assumption of self-interested\nrational participants. In conventional auctions, strategic issues include misrepresentation of the true value, collusion among bidders and false name\nbidding (where a single bidder submits bids under several aliases). Some\nof these issues can be addressed with suitable auction rules, e.g., second\nprice auctions encourage truthful reporting of values. Developing suitable\ndesigns of classical auctions in a wide range of economic contexts remains a\nchallenging problem [28].\nQuantum auctions raise strategic issues beyond those of classical auctions. In our case, every step of the adiabatic search requires each bidder\nto perform an operation on their qubits. Ideally, the bidder should use the\nsame operator U for creating \u03c8init as in every step of the search in Eq. (4). In\naddition, bidders should include the null bid in their subspaces. In the classical first-price sealed-bid auction, the bidder makes one choice: the amount\nto bid. In our quantum setting, this choice amounts to selecting the subspace to use with the quantum search. The remaining freedom to select U ,\n\n10\n\n\fand possibly a different U for each step in the search, are additional choices\nprovided by the quantum auction.\nBidders may be tempted to exploit the flexibility of choosing operators in\nseveral general ways. First, they could use a subspace not including the null\nbid. Second, they could use a different operator for creating \u03c8init than they\nuse in the rest of the search, thereby producing an altered initial amplitude\nthat is not the ground state eigenvector. Third they could change operators\nduring the search. If any such changes give significant probability for low\nbids to win, bidders would be tempted to make such changes and include\na low bid in their subspace, hoping to profit significantly by winning the\nauction with a low bid.\nThe remainder of this section describes some strategic issues unique to\nquantum auctions and possible solutions. We further discuss a game theory\nanalysis of some of these issues in Sec. 5.\n\n4.1\n\nSelecting the Subspace\n\nThe use of the null bid in our protocol raises the strategic issue illustrated\nin the following example:\nExample 3. Consider an auction of a single item with two bidders Alice\nand Bob. Using operators producing uniform amplitudes for the sake of\nillustration, they ought to apply operators that create\n\u221a1 (|\u2205i +\n2\n\n|bA i) and\n\n\u221a1 (|\u2205i +\n2\n\n|bB i)\n\nrespectively, where bA and bB are their desired bids. The initial superposition\nfor all the qubits is the product of these individual superpositions, i.e., \u03a80 is\n1\n(|\u2205, \u2205i + |bA , \u2205i + |\u2205, bB i + |bA , bB i)\n2\nIf bidders use these same operators during the search, the search algorithm\nfinds the highest revenue allocation, i.e., giving the item to the highest bidder. Suppose instead Bob picks an operator with a one-dimensional subspace,\nproducing an initial state |bB i rather than including \u2205. The product superposition is then\n1\n\u221a (|\u2205, bB i + |bA , bB i)\n2\nSince the search remains in this subspace and the second allocation is infeasible, the search will return |\u2205, bB i no matter what Alice bids. Thus Bob\nalways wins the item, and can win using the lowest possible bid.\n11\n\n\fThis example shows bidders have an incentive to exclude the null set\nfrom their subspace. If all bidders make this choice, there will be no feasible\nallocations in the joint subspace and the auction will always give no winner.\nFor auctions with more than two bidders, selecting subspaces excluding \u2205 is\na weak Nash Equilibrium for the quantum auction because any other choice\nby a single bidder still results in no feasible allocations.\n\n4.2\n\nAltering Initial Amplitudes\n\nStrategic choices for bidders also arise from the search procedure itself, even\nwhen using the correct subspace consisting of \u2205 and the desired bid. In\nparticular, the probabilistic outcome of the search means the optimal bid\naccording to the auction criterion (e.g., highest revenue) will not always win.\nFor the adiabatic search method, bidders could try to arrange for especially\ntiny eigenvalue gaps between the state corresponding to the best outcome\nand another state allowing them to win with a low bid. A sufficiently small\ngap could make the number of steps the auctioneer selects insufficient to give\nthe optimal state with high probability and instead give a significant chance\nof producing the more favorable outcome. However, because the eigenvalues\nare a complicated function of the operators of all bidders, and individual\nbidders do not know the choices made by others, it will be difficult for a\nbidder to determine how to make such especially small gaps and do so in a\nway that gives a favorable outcome. Nevertheless, even fairly small probabilities for not finding the optimal state could alter the strategic behavior\nof the bidders.\nA more direct way a bidder can arrange for a low bid to win is by altering\nthe initial state of the adiabatic search to start not in the ground state but\nin an eigenvector corresponding to one of the first few eigenvalues above\nthe ground state. The adiabatic search takes such eigenvectors, with high\nprobability, to an outcome in which a bid lower than the highest wins. While\na single bidder cannot create an arbitrary initial condition, one bidder can\nensure that it is not the ground state. For example, a bidder could chose an\noperator that\u221agives a nonuniform amplitude for the initial state,\n\u221a in particular\n(|\u2205i\u2212|bA i)/ 2, while using the uniform state (|\u2205i+|bA i)/ 2 as the ground\nstate through the remainder of the search in Eq. (4). This can result in\nsignificant probability for a low bid to win, and so a bidder is tempted to\ndeviate from the nominal operator choice.\nFig. 2 illustrates this behavior. Instead of starting in the ground state,\n\n12\n\n\f11\ninfeasible\n\n01 10\n00\nlow bid wins\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nhigh bid wins\n\nf\nFigure 2: Correspondence between initial basis and the possible allocations\nfor a single item auction with two bidders in the standard adiabatic search.\nDuring the search, as f increases from 0 to 1, the eigenvalues of the four\nstates change as shown schematically in the figure. The states for f = 0\ncorrespond to both bidders starting with the ground state, |00i, the two\nstates obtained if one of the bidders starts with a different superposition,\n|01i and |10i (\"single-bidder deviation states\"), and the state of both bidders\nstarting with different superpositions, |11i (\"2-bidder deviation state\").\nthe bidder's choice gives the initial state as a linear combination of the\nground state and the single-deviation state for that bidder, denoted as |01i\nor |10i for the two bidders in Fig. 2. Here a \"single deviation\" state is\none that a single bidder can create, i.e., by operating on just the qubits\navailable to that bidder. The adiabatic search splits the degeneracy, thereby\ngiving some probability for the lowest bid to win and some probability for\nan infeasible allocation.\nMore generally, bidder i uses this strategy by selecting two different\noperators Uiinit and Ui to use for forming the initial state and during the\nsearch, respectively. These choices result in different joint operators, in\nEq. (1), used in Eq. (3) and (4).\nAs with selecting a subspace without \u2205, if many or all bidders make\nthis choice, the initial state will have significant amplitude in eigenvectors\ncorresponding to large eigenvalues, which produce infeasible outcomes and\n13\n\n\f01 10\ninfeasible\n\n11\n00\nlow bid wins\nhigh bid wins\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nf\nFigure 3: Correspondence between the initial basis and the possible allocations for a single item auction with two bidders in the search with permuted\ninitial eigenvalues.\n\nhence a high probability for no winner. Thus with standard adiabatic search,\nif everyone uses the same operator for both initialization and search, then\neach bidder is tempted to use a different initialization operator and bid low,\ngaining a chance to win with a low bid. However, if multiple bidders attempt\nthis, the outcome will most likely be an infeasible state, with no winner.\nWe can address this problem by reordering the eigenvalues given by the\nd(x) function in Eq. (6) so that any change in initial operator by a single\nbidder increases probability of infeasible allocation but not the probability of\nany feasible allocation with a bid lower than the highest bid. This is possible\nbecause bidders only have access to their own bits, so can only form initial\nsuperpositions from a limited set of basis vectors. Fig. 3 illustrates the\nresulting situation. We give an analysis of this approach in Sec. 5.2.\n\n4.3\n\nChanging Operator During Search\n\nThe distributed search of Eq. (4) has each bidder using the same operator\nfor every step of the search. Thus bidders may gain some advantage by\naltering their operator during the steps of the search. Gradually changing\nthe operator during the search amounts to a different path from initial to\n\n14\n\n\ffinal Hamiltonian during the adiabatic search. Thus, provided the auctioneer uses enough steps, such changes will have at most a minor effect on the\noutcome probabilities unless the bidder can arrange for particularly small\neigenvalue gaps among favorable states. Such arrangement is difficult, particularly since the bidder does not know the choices of other bidders and\nthe auctioneer could treat the bits from the bidders in an arbitrary, unannounced order.\nMore significant changes in outcome is possible with sudden, large changes\nin the operator during search. Since the use of bidders operators gradually\ndecreases during the search (i.e., Dxx (f ) given in Eq. (6) approaches the\nidentity operator as f approaches 1), the most problematic situation is for\nan abrupt change in operator at the beginning of the search. After such\na change, the adiabatic search continues its gradual change of states, but\nnow instead of starting in the ground state, it will instead have a linear\ncombination of various states obtained by mapping the original basis onto\nthe basis after the change.\n\n5\n\nQuantum Auction Design\n\nIn this section, we focus on mechanism design to reduce incentive issues\narising from the quantum aspects of the auction. We analyze incentive issues with the Nash equilibrium (NE) concept commonly used to evaluate\nauctions [28]. A given set of behaviors for the bidders is an equilibrium\nif no single bidder can gain an advantage (i.e., higher expected payoff) by\nswitching to another behavior. Specifically, Sec. 5.1 describes an approach\nto encouraging bidders to include the null set in their bids. In Sec. 5.2 we\nshow that using the ground state eigenvector is a NE provided bidders do\nnot change the operators during the search. Sec. 5.3 then discusses how\nthe auctioneer can discourage bidders from changing operators. Sec. 5.4 describes how the auction can be made symmetric across the different bidders.\nWe focus on single-item auctions in this section, but the ideas extend to\nquantum combinatorial auctions, as described in Sec. 6.\n\n5.1\n\nChecking for the Null Set\n\nOne approach to the incentive to exclude the null set, described in Sec. 4.1,\nis for the auctioneer to perform a second search: for the allocation with the\nmost \u2205 values. This search uses the same distributed protocol of Eq. (4)\n15\n\n\fbut with separate qubits and a different cost function to define P (f ), i.e.,\nsetting c(x) to the number of non-\u2205 values in the allocation x. Interleaving\nthe additional search in a random order within the steps of the search for\nthe winning bid prevents bidders from knowing which search a given step\nbelongs to. So bidders could not consistently select different operators for\nthe two searches.\nIf all bidders include \u2205 in their selected subspace, this additional search\nreturns |\u2205, \u2205, . . .i. Any bidder found not to have included \u2205 could be excluded from winning the auction. At this point the auctioneer could either\nannounce there is no winner, or restart the auction for the remaining bidders without announcing this restart. The adiabatic search has a small but\nnonzero probability of returning the wrong result, which would then incorrectly conclude some bidder did not include \u2205. As long as the probability of\nsuch errors is smaller than the error probability of the search for the winner,\nthese errors should not greatly affect the incentive structure of the mechanism. Alternatively, the auctioneer could use a search completing with\nprobability one in a finite number of steps, i.e., with different choices of D\nand P in Eq. (4), the auctioneer could implement Grover's algorithm [14]\nto search for the allocation |\u2205, \u2205, . . .i in the joint subspace of the bidders.\nSince the auctioneer does not know the size of the subspaces selected by the\nbidders, the auctioneer would need to try various numbers of steps [1] before\nconcluding |\u2205, \u2205, . . .i is not in the selected subspaces. Unlike the adiabatic\nsearch, failure would only indicate some bidder had not included \u2205, but not\nwhich one. Thus the auctioneer's only alternative in this case is to announce\nthe auction has no winner.\nWhile this approach removes the immediate benefit of not including the\nnull bid, its affect on broader strategic issues in the full auction is an open\nquestion.\n\n5.2\n\nThe First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction\n\nIn this section we examine the incentive structure of the auction with permuted eigenstates described in Sec. 4.2. We first review how game theory applies to auctions. We then consider the quantum auction when the\nsearch runs long enough to give successful completion almost always (\"perfect search\"). Finally, we consider the more realistic case of search with\nsmall, but not negligible, probability for non-optimal outcomes.\n\n16\n\n\f5.2.1\n\nA Game Theory Approach to Auctions\n\nGame theory is a common approach to evaluating auctions [20, 28]. Consider n people bidding for an item, with person i having value vi for the\nitem. Unlike discrete choice games, such as the prisoner's dilemma, a strategy for a private value auction involves a bidding function b(v), mapping\na bidder's value to a corresponding bid. Theoretical analysis of auctions\nusually involves identifying a NE strategy, if any. This is a strategy for all\nplayers such that no bidder gains by changing this strategy given everyone\nelse is using it. This focus on possible changes by a single bidder assumes\nbidders do not collude.\nA primary issue for auction behavior is how much participants know\nabout other bidders' values. Such knowledge can affect the choice of bid.\nThe most popular model of such knowledge is independent private values,\nwhere the vi are independently drawn from the same distribution. Each\nbidder knows his own value, but not the values of other bidders. However,\nthe distribution from which values come is common knowledge, i.e., known\nto all bidders, each bidder knows the others know this fact, and so on. A\nfinal ingredient for the analysis is an assumption of bidders' goals. For\nillustration, we use the common assumption that bidders are risk neutral\nexpected utility maximizers, and within the context of the auction, utility\nis proportional to profit.\nWe illustrate this approach for a first-price sealed-bid auction, in which\neach bidder submits a single bid without seeing any of the other bids. This\ncorresponds to the auction scenario considered in this paper. The bidder\nwith the highest bid gets the item and pays the amount of his bid. Thus if\nbidder i bids bi , his profit is vi \u2212 bi if he wins the auction and zero otherwise.\nTo avoid possibly losing money, bidders should ensure bi \u2264 vi , and bids are\nrequired to be nonnegative.\nIn the symmetric case where bidders' values all come from the same\ndistribution, a NE is a bidding function b(v). A bidder's expected payoff\nis (v \u2212 b(v))P (b) where v is his value, b is his bidding function and P (b)\nis the probability of winning if he is using b(v) (which is also the function\nothers use in equilibrium). Let F be the cumulative distribution of values,\ni.e., probability a value is at most v, and n be the number of bidders. The\nequilibrium condition leads to a differential equation satisfied by b(v) [28].\nAs a simple example, when v is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1,\nF (v) = v and the NE is b(v) = (n \u2212 1)v/n. Thus, in the equilibrium\nstrategy, a bidder bids somewhat less than his value and the bid gets closer\n17\n\n\fto the value when there is more competition, i.e., larger n.\nIf bidders have differing value distributions, a NE involves a set of bidding\nfunctions, {bi (v)}. An auction may have multiple equilibria.\n5.2.2\n\nBehavior with Perfect Search\n\nWith perfect search and non-colluding bidders, if bidders use the same operators for every step of the search, including initialization, and pick a subspace\nwith the null bid then the adiabatic search described in Sec. 3.2 finds the\nhighest revenue state. We now show that the auctioneer can choose eigenvalues for the search so that bidders have no incentive to create an initial state\ndifferent from the ground state. This choice corresponds to the auctioneer\nselecting an appropriate function d(x) in Eq. (6).\nSuppose bidder i uses operator Ui , giving the overall operator U with\nEq. (1). Suppose all bidders except bidder 1 use the same operator to create\nthe initial state as they use for the subsequent search. But bidder 1 uses two\noperators: U1init to form the initial state and U1 for the search. Thus the\ninitial state produced by bidder 1, \u03c81 = U1init \u03c8init , i.e., the first column of\nU1init , is not necessarily equal to the first column of U1 that bidder 1 uses for\nthe subsequent search. Instead, \u03c81 may have contributions from all columns\nof U1 , i.e.,\np \u22121\n2X\n\u03b1i |ii\n(7)\n\u03c81 =\ni=0\n\nwhere |ii corresponds to column i, ranging from 0 to 2p \u22121, of\nPU1 . Combining\nwith the initial state of all other bidders, Eq. (3) gives \u03a80 = i \u03b1i |i, 0, . . . , 0i,\ninstead of the initial ground state |0, 0, . . . , 0i.\n\nSignificantly, because a bidder can only operate on the p qubits from the\nauctioneer and not on any of the qubits sent to other bidders, a single bidder\ncan only create a limited set of \"single-deviation\" initial states. In the case\nof bidder 1, these states all have the form |i, 0, . . . , 0i. Similarly, if bidder\nj is the one using different initial and search operators, the states all have\nthe form |. . . , 0, i, 0, . . .i, where only the j th position can be nonzero. Thus,\namong the 2np basis states in the full search space, aside from the correct\nground state, only n(2p \u2212 1) are possible states some single bidder can create\nwhen all other bidders use the same operator for initialization and search.\nMore generally, k bidders can create superpositions of (2p \u2212 1)k basis\nstates in which none of them use the ground state initially, by selecting\n18\n\n\fdifferent operators for initialization and search. Thus there are\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n(2p \u2212 1)k\nk\n\n(8)\n\nk-deviation states that some set of k bidders can create, while the other\nn \u2212 k bidders use the ground state.\n\nOur formulation has n(2p \u22121) feasible allocations, i.e., situations in which\nexactly one of the bidders has a non-\u2205 bid while all other bidders have \u2205.\nTo see this, each of the n bidders could have the non-\u2205 bid, and this bid\ncould have any of 2p \u2212 1 values (since the remaining value for the bidder's\nbits represents \u2205). The remaining n \u2212 1 bidders have only one choice each,\ni.e., \u2205.\nSuppose the auctioneer selects d(x) such that d(|0, . . . , 0i) = 0 is the\nlowest eigenvalue and d(x) for all single-deviation states x is the largest\nvalue, with intermediate values for all other states. Provided the number\nof infeasible allocations is at least equal to the number of single-deviation\nstates, a perfect search will then map every single-deviation state to an\ninfeasible allocation, resulting in no winner for the auction. This condition\namounts to\n2np \u2212 n(2p \u2212 1) \u2265 n(2p \u2212 1)\n(9)\nThe following claim shows that Eq. (9) always is true in an auction scenario.\nClaim 1. Eq. (9) is true for all integers n, p \u2265 1\nProof. When p = 1, Eq. (9) reduces to 2n\u22121 \u2265 n, which is true for all n \u2265 1.\n\nWe prove a stronger condition for p \u2265 2, namely there are enough infeasible states to handle up to n \u2212 1 bidders deviating. Using Eq. (8), this\nstronger condition is\nnp\n\n2\n\np\n\n\u2212 n(2 \u2212 1) \u2265\n\nn\u22121\nX\u0012\nk=1\n\n\u0013\nn\n(2p \u2212 1) = 2np \u2212 1 \u2212 (2p \u2212 1)n\nk\n\n(10)\n\nwith the k = 1 term in the sum corresponding to the right-hand side of\nEq. (9). Writing x \u2261 2p \u2212 1, Eq. (10) becomes f (x, n) \u2261 xn \u2212 nx + 1 \u2265 0.\n\nSince p \u2265 2, we have x \u2265 3. For this range of x and for n \u2265 1, f (x, n) is\nmonotonically increasing in both arguments. To see f is monotonic for x, the\nderivative of f (x, n) with respect to x is n(xn\u22121 \u2212 1) which is nonnegative\nsince n \u2265 1 and x > 1. Similarly, the derivative with respect to n is\n19\n\n\fx(xn\u22121 ln(x) \u2212 1) which is at least 3(ln(3) \u2212 1) > 0 since n \u2265 1 and x \u2265 3.\nThus for the relevant range of n and x, f (x, n) \u2265 f (3, 1) = 1 so Eq. (10) is\ntrue for all n \u2265 1 and p \u2265 2.\nCombining these cases for p = 1 and p \u2265 2 establishes the claim.\n\nUsing this claim, we demonstrate the permuted eigenvalue choices remove incentives to alter the initial amplitudes:\nTheorem 1. If (a) auctioneer chooses eigenvalues as described above, (b)\n{b\u2217i (v)}ni=1 is an equilibrium for the first-price classical auction, and (c) bidders include the null set as part of their bids and use the same operator in\neach step in the search except, possibly, for the initial state, then the strategy\nof using bidding functions {b\u2217i (v)}ni=1 and the same operator for their initial\nstate as they use in the search is a NE for corresponding quantum auction.\nProof. Without loss of generality, suppose only bidder 1 deviates and all the\nother bidders use {b\u2217i (v)}ni=2 and the same operator for initialization\nand\nP\nsearch. Then, as described above, the initial state \u03a80 is i \u03b1i |i, 0, . . . , 0i\nfor some choice of amplitudes \u03b1i , with i ranging from 0 to 2p \u2212 1.\n\nA perfect adiabatic search maps each of these states to a corresponding\nallocation. In particular, with d(|0, . . . , 0i) having the smallest value of\nthe function d(x), the lowest cost allocation is produced with probability\n|\u03b10 |2 . This allocation corresponds to the highest bid winning. Moreover,\neach |i, 0, . . . , 0i with i 6= 0 has the largest value of d(x), and so, because\nof Eq. (9), maps to an infeasible allocation, giving no winner and hence no\nvalue to bidder 1.\nHence the expected value for bidder 1 is |\u03b10 |2 V where V is the value of\nthe expected profit of the corresponding classical auction to bidder 1. Since\n|\u03b10 |2 V \u2264 V , bidder 1 cannot gain from such a deviation.\n\nFurthermore, there is no gain from deviating from the bidding function\nb\u22171 (v) since it will only decrease V , because, by assumption, {b\u2217i (v)}ni=1 is a\nNE for the corresponding classical auction.\nBecause of Eq. (9), this discussion applies to deviations by any single\nbidder, not just bidder 1. Thus, using bidding function {b\u2217i (v)}ni=1 and using\nthe same operator for their initial state as they use in the search is a NE.\n\nThe stronger condition, Eq. (10), shows that the number of infeasible\n20\n\n\fstates is enough to give no winner for any choice of initial amplitudes that\nup to n \u2212 1 bidders can produce, provided p \u2265 2. Thus if an auctioneer\nimplements a collusion-proof classical auction with the quantum protocol\nand assigns infeasible states as described then the resulting quantum auction\nis collusion-proof up to n \u2212 1 bidders for initial amplitude deviations.\n\nThe choice for d(x) satisfying the above requirements is not unique.\nAs one example, let x be the state index in the full search space, running\nfrom 0 to 2np \u2212 1. Consider x as written as a series of n base-2p numbers,\n|x1 , x2 , . . . , xn i. Define\nd(x) = \u2212r(x) (mod n + 1)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere r(x) is number of nonzero values among x1 , x2 , ..., xn . The mod operation gives all d(x) values in the range 0 to n. For the initial ground state,\nx = |0, . . . , 0i, r(x) = 0 so d(x) = 0, and this is the smallest possible value.\nSingle-deviation states have exactly one of the xi nonzero, giving r(x) = 1\nand d(x) = n, the largest possible value. More generally, all k-deviation\nstates have r(x) = k so d(x) = n + 1 \u2212 k. This function definition gives\nvalues directly from the representation of the state x, so, in particular, the\nauctioneer can implement it without any knowledge of the subspaces selected\nby the bidders.\nThe assumption of perfect search is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the proof of Theorem 1. The necessary conditions are more complicated because we only need that every single bidder deviation maps to a\nlinear combination of infeasible states. Thus mixing among different singledeviation states during search (e.g., due to small eigenvalue gaps among\nthose states), or among states corresponding to two or more bidders deviating, does not affect the proof.\n5.2.3\n\nBounded Number of Search Steps\n\nTheorem 1 shows the quantum auction has the same NE as the classical\nfirst price auction if the search is perfect and each bidder uses the same\noperator for every search step of Eq. (4). Since adiabatic search, run for a\nfinite number of steps, is not perfect we examine the effect on the NE of\nan imperfect search. We show that the NE for perfect search, i.e., bidding\nas in a classical first price auction and using the same operator initially\nand during the search, is an \u01eb-equilibrium for the auction with imperfect\nsearch. Furthermore, \u01eb converges to zero as the number of search steps goes\n21\n\n\fto infinity. A strategic profile is an \u01eb-equilibrium [24] if for every player,\nthe gains of unilateral defecting to another strategy is at most \u01eb. This\nweaker equilibrium concept is useful in our case because determining how to\nexploit imperfect search is computationally difficult. Specifically, with the\nsmall eigenvalue gaps and degeneracy it is hard to know whether imperfect\nsearch benefits a particular bidder. Thus computational cost will likely\noutweigh the small possible gain. In this situation, an \u01eb-equilibrium is a\nuseful generalization of NE.\nWe must prove that for any \u01eb there exists an N so that if the search\nprocess uses at least N steps, the equilibrium of the game with a perfect\nsearch is also an \u01eb-equilibrium when using the actual search. To do so,\nwe bound the possible gain from deviation based on prior knowledge of the\nrange of possible bidder values. That is, we assume the distribution of values\nhas a finite upper bound v\u0304. In our context, one such bound is the maximum\nbid value expressible by the announced interpretation of each bidders qubits.\nTheorem 2. If the conditions of Theorem 1 are met, and assuming the possible bidder values are bounded by v\u0304, for any \u01eb > 0, there exists an N so that\nthe NE in the quantum auction with a perfect search, shown in Theorem 1,\nis also an \u01eb-equilibrium of the same auction with an imperfect search using\nN search steps.\nProof. Let ph be the probability of the highest bid wins. Let pinf be the\nprobability of reaching an infeasible state. Then po = 1 \u2212 ph \u2212 pinf is the\nprobability of a bid other than the highest bid wins.\nWith the adiabatic search, with nonzero eigenvalue gaps, the probability\nof correctly mapping the initial to final states converges to one as the number\nof search steps increases. Thus for any \u03b4 > 0, there always exists a N where\npo is at most \u03b4.\nWe define an equilibrium expected payoff function for bidder i with value\nv as \u03c0i\u2217 (v), when all bidders use their equilibrium bidding functions.\nWithout loss of generality, from the perspective of bidder i with value\nv, the probability of achieving the equilibrium payoff, \u03c0i\u2217 (v), if that bidder\ndoes not deviate is 1 \u2212 \u03b4. Thus the expected payoff of deviating is at most\n\u03c0ideviate (v) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)\u03c0i\u2217 (v) + \u03b4v\u0304 because (a) the most any bidder can gain is\nbounded by v\u0304, and (b) with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4 the auction either produces no\nprofit (pinf ) or is identical to a classical auction (ph ).\nThe expected gain g from deviating is the expected payoff from deviating\n22\n\n\fminus the expected payoff with no deviation, i.e., g = \u03c0ideviate (v) \u2212 \u03c0i\u2217 (v) \u2264\n\u03b4(v\u0304 \u2212 \u03c0i\u2217 (v)), which in turn is at most \u03b4v\u0304. Thus for any choice of \u03b4, there\nalways exists an N where the maximum deviation benefit is at most \u03b4v\u0304.\nFor any \u01eb > 0, using \u03b4 = \u01eb/v\u0304 in the above discussion shows there always\nexists an N where the deviation is at most \u01eb.\n\n5.3\n\nTesting for Changed Operators During Search\n\nOne approach to the incentive issue of changing operators during search,\ndescribed in Sec. 4.3, is for the auctioneer to test the bidders by randomly\ninserting additional probe steps in the search.\nSpecifically, suppose at any step of the search the auctioneer, with some\nprobability, decides to check a bidder by sending a new set of qubits in a\nknown state |\u03c6i, while storing the qubits for the search until a subsequent\nstep. For the test step, the auctioneer sets D or P to the identity operator.\nThe state returned by the bidder is then Ui\u2032 Ui\u2020 |\u03c6i or Ui\u2032\u2020 Ui |\u03c6i, depending on\nwhich part of the search step in Eq. (4) the auctioneer is testing. Without\nloss of generality, we consider the former case.\nIdeally, the bidder uses the same operator, so Ui\u2032 = Ui and Ui\u2032 Ui\u2020 is the\nidentity. Suppose the test state is formed from some operator V , randomly\nselected by the auctioneer, |\u03c6i = V |0i. If Ui\u2032 Ui\u2020 is not the identity, the returned state has the form \u03b1 |\u03c6i+\u03b2 |\u03c6\u22a5 i, where |\u03c6\u22a5 i is some state orthogonal\nto |\u03c6i and |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. The auctioneer then applies V \u2020 , giving\n\u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |ai\n\n(12)\n\nfor some value a 6= 0. The auctioneer then measures this state, getting\n0 with probability |\u03b1|2 , indicating the bidder passes the test. Otherwise,\nthe auctioneer observes a different value, indicating the bidder changed the\noperator.\nHence the chance of getting caught depends on how often the auctioneer\nchecks, and how big a change the bidder makes in the operator. Larger\noperator changes are more likely to be caught. This testing behavior is\nappropriate as small changes are not likely to have much affect on the search\noutcome, and instead simply act as an alternate adiabatic path from initial\nto final states. This technique is especially useful for risk averse bidders\nsince then even a small chance to be caught might be enough to prevent\nbidders from wanting to change operators.\n23\n\n\f5.4\n\nAssigning Eigenvalues to Subspaces\n\nQuantum search acts on the full space of superpositions of the available\nqubits, i.e., in our case to all 2np configurations of items and bids. In the\nauction context, bidders choose operators to restrict the search to a subspace\nof possible bids, namely the ones they wish to make. Conceptually, the\nsearch described above is then restricted to the subspace selected by the\nbidders.\nThe search can also be viewed as taking place in the full space of 2np\nconfigurations. The operator U appearing in the search algorithm is block\ndiagonal (up to a permutation of the basis states), with only the block\noperating on the selected subspace relevant for the search outcome. This\nview of the search is that of the auctioneer, who has no prior knowledge\nof the subspace selected by each bidder. The operator U is not known\nto any single individual: instead its implementation is distributed among\nthe bidders, with each bidder implementing a part of the overall operator.\nThe auctioneer chooses the eigenvalues for the initial Hamiltonian and the\nordering for the qubits assigned to each bidder. These choices, which could\nchange during the search, affect the incentive structure of the auction as\ndescribed in Sec. 5.2.\nThis section describes how the auctioneer's choice of d(x) can give the\nsame eigenvalues when restricted to the subspace actually selected for the\nsearch. For simplicity, we suppose each bidder uses a 2-dimensional subspace, consisting of \u2205 and the desired bid for the single item. While not\nessential for the NE results discussed above, uniformity with respect to subspace choices means bidders are treated uniformly, so convergence of the\nsearch is independent of the order in which the auctioneer considers the\nbidders.\n5.4.1\n\nAn Example\n\nConsider n = 2 bidders, each with p = 2 bits, representing 4 values: \u2205\nand three bid values 1, 2, 3. A set of\n\u221a 2-bit operators to form a uniform\nsuperposition of the form (|\u2205i + |bi)/ 2 where b is the bid value, 1, 2 or 3,\n\n24\n\n\f\u221a\nis 1/ 2 times\n\uf8eb\n1 \u22121\n\uf8ec1 1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0 0\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n0 0\n1\n\uf8ec0\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n1 \u22121 \uf8f8 \uf8ed1\n1 1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 \u22121 0\n1 0 0 \u22121\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1 0 \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec0 1 1 0 \uf8f7\n0 1\n0 \uf8f8 \uf8ed0 \u22121 1 0 \uf8f8\n1 0\n1\n1 0 0 1\n\nwhich we can denote as A1 , A2 , A3 , respectively, with the first columns giving\nthe uniform superposition of the three possible bid values. If the bidders\nselect bids b1 , b2 , respectively, the overall operator for the search is U =\nAb1 \u2297 Ab2 , used in Eq. (4) to perform each step of the search. Thus in this\ncase there are 9 possible subspaces the two bidders can jointly select. Up to\na permutation, U is block diagonal with the block containing the nonzero\nentries of the first column, and hence all the nonzero amplitude during the\nsearch, equal to\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 \u22121 \u22121 1\n\uf8ec1 1 \u22121 \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nV =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed1 \u22121 1 \u22121 \uf8f8\n1 1\n1\n1\nThe search using U in the full 4-bit space is thus equivalent to one taking\nplace in the 2-bit subspace selected by the two bidders using this operator\nV.\nThe auctioneers' choice of eigenvalues, i.e., the function d(x) used in\nEq. (6) should ensure the uniform superposition within the subspace defined\nby the two bidders has the lowest value, say 0, and all other eigenstates have\nlarger values.\nOne possibility is the standard choice for the diagonal values d(x) when\nsearching in the full space of 24 states defined by the np = 4 bits, namely\nthe Hamming weight of each state, i.e., the number of 1 bits in its binary\nrepresentation, ranging from 0 to 4.\nAn alternative approach is picking d(x) so eigenvalues for the four states\nappearing in V have the same values as they would have with using the\nHamming weight for a 2-bit search, ranging from 0 to 2. Doing so requires\nselecting the eigenvalues to match the corresponding Hamming weights for\nany choices the bidders make among A1 , A2 , A3 . In this example, each bidder\nhas 2 qubits, so can represent 4 states, which we denote as |0i , . . . , |3i. The\nstates for both bidders are products of these individual states, |0, 0i , . . . , |3, 3i.\nExamining the 9 possible cases for U , shows a consistent set of choices is\nd(|x, yi) equal to the number of nonzero values among x, y. With this d(x),\n25\n\n\fthe adiabatic search in the subspace selected by the bidders is identical to\nthe standard adiabatic search for two bits. This choice treats both bidders\nidentically.\nIn this case we see the auctioneer can arrange the adiabatic search to\noperate symmetrically no matter what choice of subspace each bidder makes\n(i.e., no matter what value each bidder decides to bid). Thus from the point\nof view of the bidders, the search, in effect, takes place within the subspace\nof possible values defined by their bid selections.\n5.4.2\n\nGeneral Case\n\nFor arbitrary numbers of bidders n and bits p, we consider a single-item\nauction so each bidder would, ideally, pick an operator giving just two terms,\nwith b(j) the bid of bidder j for the single item and no bits needed to specify\nwhich item the bidder is interested in. The choice of b(j) corresponds to\nthe bidder picking a 2-dimensional subspace of the 2p possible states. The\nproduct of these subspaces gives a subspace S of all np qubits used in the\nauction. The subspace S has dimension 2n and its states xS can be viewed\nas strings of n bits. More specifically, we suppose bidder j implements the\noperator Uj such that the rows and columns corresponding to \u2205 and b(j)\nhave nonzero values only for positions \u2205 and b(j) . That is, the elements of\nUj for these two values form a 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix.\nIf the auctioneer knew the subspace S, the eigenvalue function d(x) used\nin Eq. (6) could be selected to match any desired function dS (xS ) of the\nstates in xS \u2208 S. Without such knowledge, this is possible only for some\nchoices for dS .\n\nTheorem 3. Provided dS (xS ) depends only on the Hamming weight of the\nstates xS , a single choice of d(x) in the full space corresponds to dS (xS ) in\nall possible subspaces the bidders could select that include the null set.\nProof. Consider the full operator U given by Eq. (1). For the element Ux,y ,\nexpress the np bits defining the states x and y as sequences of p-bit values,\nx1 , . . . , xn and y1 , . . . , yn , respectively, with each xi and yi between 0 and\n2p \u2212 1. From Eq. (1),\nn\nY\n(Ui )xi ,yi\nUx,y =\ni=1\n\nThe matrix U is of size\n\n2np\n\n\u00d7 2np\n\nwhile each Ui is of size 2p \u00d7 2p .\n26\n\n\fConsider the first column of U , i.e., y = 0. Ux,0 is nonzero only for those\nx such that all the (Ui )xi ,0 are nonzero. For this to be the case, each xi is\neither 0 (corresponding to |\u2205i for that bidder's superposition) or xi = b(i) ,\ni.e., the bid value. Similarly, for all columns with each yi equal to 0 or b(i) .\nThese values for x, y are precisely the states in the selected subspace of the\nbidders, S. For these choices of xi , yi , we can map 0 (i.e., p bits all equal to\nzero) to the single bit 0, and each b(i) (specified by values for p bits) to the\nsingle bit 1. This establishes a one-to-one mapping from states in the full\nspace, of np bits corresponding to the product of bidders' superpositions,\nto states in the subspace treated as n-bit vectors. Thus a function dS (xS )\napplied to the subspace that depends on the Hamming weight, i.e., the\nnumber of 1 bits in xS , is the same as a function on the full space depending\non the number of nonzero xi values in x = x1 , . . . , xn .\nWe must show that a single choice of function d(x) in the full space\nmaps to the desired dS (xS ) in any choice of bidder subspaces. To see this\nis the case, consider any state in the full space x = x1 , . . . , xn . Among\nthese xi , suppose h are nonzero, denoted by xa1 , . . . , xah . This state x\nwill appear in all selected subspaces in which bidder aj bids b(aj ) = xaj ,\nfor j = 1, . . . , h, and the remaining bidders have any choice of bid. That\nis, x appears in (2p \u2212 1)n\u2212h possible subspaces S. Since x has exactly h\nnonzero values, in each of these possible subspaces it maps to a state xS\nwith exactly h bits equal to 1, i.e., it has the same Hamming weight, h,\nin all possible subspaces in which it appears. Thus any choice of function\ndS (xS ) depending only on the Hamming weight of xS will have the same\nvalue in all these possible subspaces. This observation allows the auctioneer\nto select that common value as the value for d(x), consistently giving the\ndesired eigenvalue function for any possible subspace. Since this holds for\nall values of h, the auctioneer can operate in the full space with identical\nsearch behavior no matter what subspace the bidders select.\nFor the auctioneer to operate without knowledge of the actual subspace\nselected by the bidders and treat bidders identically, we need d(x) to map\nto the same function on any subspace selected. In this case, the search\nproceeds exactly as if the auctioneer did know the subspace choices made\nby the bidders. The theorem gives one type of function for in which this is\nthe case. In particular, Eq. (11) is an example of a function satisfying this\ntheorem.\n\n27\n\n\f6\n\nMultiple Items and Combinatorial Auction\n\nWhile the paper focuses on the single item first-price sealed-bid auction, the\nquantum protocol can apply to multiple items by changing the interpretation\nof the bids, i.e., the bidding language. Such changes affect the counting of\ndeviation and feasible states, so we must check the validity of Theorem 1.\nIn the single item case, each bidder uses the p qubits to specify the bid\namount. With multiple items, the bid must specify both the items of interest\nand a bid amount for the items. Various bidding languages can encode this\ninformation.\nFor multiple items, we divide the p qubits allocated to each bidder into\ntwo parts: pitem bits to denote a bundle of items and pprice bits to denote bid\nvalue (so p = pitem + pprice ). Since qubits are expensive, a succinct representation of items is best. Depending on the type of auction, we have various\nchoices with different efficiency in using bits. For example, the pitem item\nbits could indicate the item in the bid, allowing pitem qubits to specify up to\n2pitem different items. Another case is multiple units of a single item, so pitem\ncould specify how many units a bidder wants (with the understanding the\nbid is for all those units not a partial amount) so the bits could specify 2pitem\ndifferent numbers. In the general case, bids are on arbitrary sets of items or\nbundles, and we represent a bundle with m bits, 1 if the corresponding item\nis a part of the bundle and 0 otherwise, i.e., m = pitem . We focus on this\ngeneral case in the remainder of the section. Allowing bids on sets of items\nis called a combinatorial auction [6].\nWith multiple items, the bid\nE operator \u03c8j = Uj \u03c8init gives a superposition\n(j)\n(j) (j)\nwhere bi is bidder j's bid for a bundle of\nof bids of the form Ii , bi\n(j)\n\nitems Ii . In this notation, the null bid is |\u2205, bi, and the specified amount\nb is irrelevant so we take it to be zero in the examples. A superposition\nspecifies a set of distinct bids, with at most one allowed to win.\nExample 4. Consider a combinatorial auction with two items X, Y and\ninteger prices ranging from 0 to 3. With p = 4 bits for each bidder, using 2\nbits each to specify item bundles and prices, is sufficient to specify the bids.\nThe full space for a bidder has dimension 2p = 16, consisting of 4 possible\nitem bundle choices and 4 price choices. Suppose a bidder places a bid\n1\n\u221a (|\u2205, 0i + |X, 1i + |(X, Y ), 2i)\n3\ni.e., a bid of 1 for item X alone, and 2 for the bundle of both items. In this\n28\n\n\fcase, the bidder is not interested in item Y by itself. The dimension of the\nsubspace of this bid is 3. Another example is the bid\n1\n\u221a (|\u2205, 0i + |X, 1i + |X, 3i + |(X, Y ), 4i)\n4\nThe dimension of the subspace is 4. This superposition has multiple bids on\nthe same item X.\nThis bidding language is both expressive and compact. For instance, a\nsuperposition of bundles of items readily expresses exclusive-or preferences,\nwhere a bidder wants at most one of the bundles. It is also compact because\nsuperpositions allow the bidder to use exactly the same qubits to place\nno bid (i.e., \u2205) and to place all the exponential number of bundles in a\ncombinatorial auction.\nAn allocation, as defined in Sec. 3.1, is a list of bids, one from each\nbidder. With multiple items, an allocation is feasible if the item sets are\npairwise disjoint. As in the single item case, we consider the allocation\nwhen all item sets are empty as infeasible. The value of a feasible allocation\nis the sum total of the bid values of the different bids in the allocation. The\nnumber of feasible states is ((n + 1)m \u2212 1)2npprice . This is because we can\nassign m items among n bidders where all items need not be allocated in\n(n+1)m ways. The factor n+1 allows for some items to remain unallocated.\nSince the allocation when all bidders place the null bid is an infeasible state,\nwe subtract 1. Each bidder can specify 2pprice different prices for the bundle\ngiving 2npprice possible choices for n bidders. Note that the number of feasible\nstates for a single item, m = 1, is different from that in Sec. 5.2 because\nhere we have changed the bidding language to represent items also.\nThe null bid in our protocol simplifies the evaluation of allocations for\ncombinatorial auctions. To see this, consider a protocol without the null bid.\nIn a single item case, F (x) for any allocation vector x would be maximum of\nthe bids placed by the different bidders on the item, which is fairly easy to\ncompute. But in the case of multiple items, there could be several allocations\nfor a vector x. For example suppose Alice bids on the set {A, B} and Bob\nbids on {B, C}. Without the null set then both bids appear in the same\nstate and have to be evaluated by F (x). The possible allocation to the\nbidders are\n1. none to either\n2. {A, B} to Alice\n29\n\n\f3. {B, C} to Bob, and\n4. {A, B} to Alice and {B, C} to Bob (which is infeasible)\nF (x) will have to compute the maximum of the values in all these states.\nThis is computationally complex when there are many items. By contrast,\nthe bidding language with the null bid avoids this combinatorial evaluation\nwithin the search function F (x).\nAs in the case of single item auctions, we restrict ourselves to a one-shot\nsealed bid classical combinatorial auction that we implement in a quantum\nsetting. The total number of states is 2pn and the total number of single\nbidder deviations states is n(2p \u2212 1). These expressions are the same as the\nsingle item case. The condition for all single-deviation states to be mapped\nto infeasible allocations, resulting in no winner, is\n2np \u2212 ((n + 1)m \u2212 1)2npprice \u2265 n(2p \u2212 1)\n\n(13)\n\nThis condition holds for cases relevant for auctions as seen in the following\nclaim.\nClaim 2. Eq. (13) is true for all integers m, pprice \u2265 1 and n \u2265 2.\nProof. Recall p = m + pprice . We prove a stronger condition for integers\nn, m \u2265 2, i.e., there exists enough infeasible states to handle joint deviations\nup to n \u2212 1 bidders. The number of k-bidder deviation states is the same\nas the single-item case, i.e., Eq. (8). Thus this stronger condition, with the\nsame right-hand side as Eq. (10), is\n2np \u2212 ((n + 1)m \u2212 1)2npprice \u2265 2np \u2212 1 \u2212 (2p \u2212 1)n\nHence Eq. (14) is true if\n(2p \u2212 1)n \u2265 ((n + 1)m \u2212 1)2npprice\n\n\u21d4 2pprice n (2m \u2212 2\u2212pprice )n \u2265 ((n + 1)m \u2212 1)2npprice\n\u21d4 (2m \u2212 2\u2212pprice )n \u2265 (n + 1)m \u2212 1\n\nSince 2\u2212pprice \u2264 1, Eq. (14) is true if\n(2m \u2212 1)n \u2265 (n + 1)m \u2212 1\nwhich is true if\n\n1\n\n1\n\n(2m \u2212 1) m \u2265 (n + 1) n\n30\n\n(14)\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\nLet f (m) \u2261 (2m \u2212 1) m and g(n) \u2261 (n + 1) n . We establish the required\ninequality, f (m) \u2265 g(n), by showing f (m) is increasing in m \u221a\nwhen m \u2265 2,\ng(n) is decreasing in n when n \u2265 2 and noting f (2) = g(2) = 3.\nTaking the derivative of f (m) with respect to m, we get,\n1\n\n(2m \u2212 1) m\nm\n\n\u0012\n\n2m ln(2) ln(2m \u2212 1)\n\u2212\n2m \u2212 1\nm\n\n\u0013\n\nThis is positive if and only if\n2m\nm\n>1\nm\n2 \u2212 1 log2 (2m \u2212 1)\nThis is true because log2 (2m \u2212 1) < log2 (2m ) = m and hence both fractions\nin the expression are greater than 1. Thus, f (m) is increasing for all m \u2265 2.\n\nTaking derivative of g(n) with respect to n, we get,\n1\n\n(n + 1) n\nn\n\n\u0012\n\nln(1 + n)\n1\n\u2212\n1+n\nn\n\n\u0013\n\nThis is negative if and only if\nln(1 + n)\n\n1+n\n>1\nn\n\nThis is true for n \u2265 2. Thus g(n) is decreasing in n for n \u2265 2.\n\nThus we have shown that Eq. (13) is true for n, m \u2265 2. It can be easily\nchecked that Eq. (13), is not true for n = 1 and true when n = 2 and\nm = 1.\n\nThus, if a classical combinatorial auction has a NE then the corresponding quantum auction protocol also has a NE with respect to initial state\ndeviations. Also there is an \u01eb-equilibrium of the same auction with an imperfect search using N search steps. Moreover, the stronger condition of\nEq. (14) shows that in auctions with at least two bidders (n > 1), there are\nenough infeasible states to give no winner for any deviation of initial amplitudes that up to n \u2212 1 can produce. Thus no groups, up to size n \u2212 1, can\ncollude to benefit from initial amplitude deviations in the quantum auction.\n\n31\n\n\f7\n\nApplications of Quantum Auctions\n\nTwo properties of quantum information may provide benefits to auctioneers\nand bidders: the ability to compactly express complicated combinations of\npreferences via superpositions and entanglement and the destruction of the\nquantum state upon measurement. This section describes some economic\nscenarios that could benefit from these properties.\nAs one economic application, quantum auctions provide a natural way to\nsolve the allocative externality problem [18, 25]. In this situation, a bidder's\nvalue for an item depends on the items received by other bidders. For\nexample, consider companies bidding on a big government project requiring\nmultiple companies to work on different parts. Allocative externality refers\nto the issue that the costs for a company which wins a contract for one part\ndepends on which other companies win other parts. So company A may\nbe willing to bid more aggressively if it knows that company B will work\non related parts. Multiple simultaneous auctions for separate parts will not\nhandle these interdependencies and thus will be inefficient. One possible\nsolution is to let companies form partnership bids. That is joint bids that\nare accepted together or not at all. Quantum information processing allows\nfor a natural way of forming partnership bids via entanglement. With the\nprotocol described in Sec. 6, multiple bids can be entangled so they will\neither all be accepted together or none will be. Furthermore, quantum\nauctions may provide more flexibility with respect to information privacy of\npartnership bids than classical methods.\nSpecifically, with multiple items, groups of bidders could select joint operators on their combined qubits, allowing them to express joint constraints\n(e.g., where they either all win their specified items or none of them do)\nwithout any of the other bidders or auctioneer knowing this choice. The\nbidders do so by creating an entangled state instead of the factored form\nfor their qubits. Thus employing quantum entanglement provides bidders a\nnatural way for expressing any allocative externality. This possibility shows\nbidding languages based on qubits are highly expressive and compact because bidders can use the same bits to express their individual bids and joint\nbids via entanglement.\nExample 5. Alice and Bob could jointly form the state\n1\n\u221a (|\u2205, 0, \u2205, 0i + |IA , bA , IB , bB i + |IC , bC , ID , bD i)\n3\n\n(15)\n\nto represent the bidders willing to pay bA and bB for items IA and IB , or\n32\n\n\fto pay bC and bD for items IC and ID , but they are not willing to buy other\ncombinations, such as IA for Alice and ID for Bob.\nIn this scenario, a direct representation of bids, i.e., without a null bid,\nwould not guarantee the joint preferences are satisfied for all entangled bidders or none of them. That is, without null bids, the superposition could\nnot express the joint preference through entanglement.\nA group of k bidders operating jointly on their qubits to form entangled\nbids could also produce initial amplitudes involving up to k-bidder deviation\nstates. However the discussion with Eq. (14) on multiple item auctions shows\nour protocol can handle all deviation states a group of up to n\u22121 bidders can\nproduce, i.e., by mapping them to infeasible outcomes. Thus the additional\nexpressivity used for joint bids does not introduce additional opportunities\nfor collusion to change the outcomes via initial amplitude selection.\nA second economic application for quantum auctions arises from their\nprivacy guarantee for losing bids. This property is economically useful when\nbidders have incentives to hide information. An example is a scenario in\nwhich companies are bidding for government contracts year after year. A\ncompany's bid usually contains information about its cost structure. If there\nis reasonable expectation that the losing bids will be revealed, a company\nmay want to bid less aggressively to reduce the amount of information passed\nto its competition for use in future auctions. This will lead to a less efficient\nauction than if bidders reveal their true values. In this situation, a privacy\nguarantee on the losing bids enables bidders to bid with less inhibition.\nMore generally, this privacy issue is only relevant when there are additional\ninteractions between these companies after the auction is concluded, such as\nfuture auctions or negotiations where participants may be at a disadvantage\nif their values are known to others.\nThis strong privacy property is unique to quantum information processing. Privacy can be enforced via cryptographic methods for multi-player\ncomputation [13], and in an auction can keep losing bids secret [22]. However, the information on the bids, and the key to decrypt them, remains\nafter the auction completes. People who have access to the key may be\nlegally compelled to reveal the information or choose to sell it. So while\ncryptography can be secured computationally, it cannot guarantee the integrity of the person(s) who have the means to decrypt the information.\nOn the other hand, the quantum method destroys losing bids during the\nsearch for the winning one and it is physically impossible to reconstruct\nthe bids after the auction process. Similarly, some of the other properties\n33\n\n\fof quantum auctions, such as correlations for partnership bids, can be provided classically [19]. Moreover, quantum mechanisms are readily simulated\nclassically [27] (as long as they involve at most 20 to 30 qubits). However,\nthese classical approaches lack the information security of quantum states.\nMore study is needed to determine scenarios where the privacy property of\nthe quantum protocol is significant.\n\n8\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis paper describes a quantum protocol for auctions, gives a game theory\nanalysis of some strategic issues the protocol raises and suggests economic\nscenarios that could benefit from these auctions. These include the privacy\nof bids and the possibility of addressing allocative externalities. The search\nused in our protocol can use arbitrary criteria for evaluating allocations,\nthereby implementing other types of auctions with quantum states. Thus\nwhile we focus our attention on the first-price sealed-bid auction, the protocol is more general: it can implement other pricing and allocation rules,\nas well as multiple-unit-multiple-item auctions with combinatorial bids. For\nexample we can use this protocol in a multiple stage, iterative auction. In\nfact, the protocol supports general bidding languages.\nEncoding bids in quantum states raises new game theory issues because\nthe bidders' strategic choices include specifying amplitudes in the quantum\nstates. The auction is not only probabilistic, but the winning probability\nis not just a function of the amount bid. Instead a bidder can change the\nprobability of winning by altering the amplitudes of the quantum states\nencoding his bid. For example, in the context of the first-price sealed-bid\nauction, the auction does not guarantee the allocation of the item to the\nhighest bidder.\nWe show that the correct design of the protocol can solve a specific\nversion of this incentive problem. The salient design feature is an incentive\ncompatible mechanism so that bidders do not want to cheat, as opposed to\nan algorithmic secure protocol that prevents bidders from cheating. Thus,\nour design is an example of a quantum algorithm, in this case adiabatic\nsearch, tuned to improve incentive issues rather than the usual focus in\nquantum information processing on computation or security properties of\nalgorithms.\nIn addition, we show that the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding\n\n34\n\n\fclassical first-price sealed-bid auction is an \u01eb-equilibrium of the quantum\nauction and that \u01eb converges to zero when the quantum search associated\nwith the protocol uses an increasing number of steps, under the conditions\nlisted in Theorem 1. This result is with respect to changes in the initial\nstate of the search. It remains to be seen whether other bidder strategies\ngive some unilateral benefit, requiring further adjustments to the auction\ndesign.\nThere are multiple directions for future work. First, we plan a series\nof human subject experiments on whether people can indeed bid effectively\nin the simple quantum auction scenario described in this paper. As with\nprevious experiments with a quantum public goods mechanism [2], such experiments are useful tests of the applicability of game theory in practice,\nand also suggest useful training and decision support tools. In particular,\npeople's behavior in a quantum auction could differ from game theory predictions that people select a Nash equilibrium based on idealized assumptions\nof human rationality and full ability to evaluate consequences of strategic\nchoices with uncertainty.\nSecond, we plan to extend studies of quantum auctions to more complicated economic scenarios, such as one with allocative externality. Our\nanalysis considers a single auction. An interesting extension is to a series of\nauctions for similar items. If auctions are repeated, the game theory analysis is more complicated [28]. In particular, privacy concerns become more\nsignificant since information revealed by a bidder's behavior in one auction\nmay benefit other bidders in later auctions.\nThe quantum auction destroys all information about the losing bids. As\na result, it is not possible to conduct after-the-fact audits to verify that\nthe auction has been conducted correctly. Is there a way to modify the\nmechanism to enable audits while preserving some of the privacy guarantees? Security is another interesting issue. For example, there may be third\nparties, aside from the auctioneer and bidders who are interested in intercepting and changing bits in transit. Auctioneers may have incentives to\ndetect a bidder's bid or skew auction results. The question is whether we\ncan build security around the protocol to prevent or at least detect these\ntypes of attacks.\nSimilarly, many economics issues surrounding the protocol remain to be\nresolved. For example, people behave as if they are risk averse in auction\nsituations [5, 4] which can change the predictions of game theory. Another\nissue arises from the possibility of multiple Nash equilibria. We have only\n35\n\n\fshown that the desirable outcome is an equilibrium. The quantum protocol\ncan also have other equilibria. Since the Nash equilibrium concept alone\ndoes not indicate how people select one equilibrium over another, additional\nstudy is needed to determine when the desirable outcome is likely to occur.\nOur protocol makes only limited use of quantum states, in particular\nencoding bids in the subspace selected by the bidders but not using the\namplitudes separately. Thus it would be interesting to examine extensions to\nthe protocol exploiting the wider range of options for bidders. For example,\na protocol might use amplitudes of superpositions to indicate a bidder's\nprobabilistic preferences, say, as in constructing a portfolio of items with\nvarious expected values and risks. Such portfolios could be useful if bidders\nhave some uncertainty in their values (e.g., in bidding for oil field exploration\nrights) rather than the standard private value framework considered in this\npaper, where bidders know their own values for the items. With uncertain\nvalues, probabilistic bids could allow bidders to match their risk preferences\nalong with their value estimates within the auction process.\nAs a final note, the number of qubits necessary to conduct an auction is\nsmall compared to the requirement of complex computations such as factoring. For example, if each bidder uses 7 bits (corresponding to 27 or about\n100 bid values) and there are 3 bidders, about 25 qubits are needed, considerably less than thousands needed for factoring interesting-sized numbers.\nThus with the advancement of quantum information processing technologies,\neconomics mechanisms could be early feasible applications.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe have benefited from discussions with Raymond Beausoleil, Saikat Guha, Philip\nKuekes, Andrew Landahl and Tim Spiller.
