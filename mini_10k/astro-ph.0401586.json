Cygnus X-2 is a close binary comprising a 1.78 M\u2299 neutron star in a 9.84 day binary orbit with a\n0.6 M\u2299 sub-giant companion star (Orosz & Kuulkers 1999).\nSince its discovery in 1965 (Bowyer et al. 1965) there have\nbeen a host of observations in the optical (eg. van Paradijs\net al. (1990)), ultraviolet (eg. Vrtilek et al. (1990)) and X-ray\n(eg. Kuulkers, van der Klis & Vaughan (1996)) wavebands.\nThe optical counterpart of Cygnus X-2, V1341 Cygni, has\na spectral type A9III and contributes about 50% of the total visual flux (Casares, Charles & Kuulkers 1998). The reprocessing of X-rays in Cygnus X-2 is shown by the large\ncontribution of the disc to the UV continuum and emission\n\nline fluxes, which arise predominantly from the X-ray heated\naccretion disc (de Jong, van Paradijs & Augusteijn 1996).\nCygnus X-2 belongs to the sub-class of LMXBs known\nas Z-sources, whose X-ray spectral states trace a Z-shaped\npattern in X-ray colour-colour diagrams (see Hasinger & van\nder Klis 1989). In a similar manner to the colour-colour diagrams familiar to optical astronomers, whose colour indices\nare magnitude differences between two bands, X-ray colourcolour diagrams employ \"hardness ratios\", which are ratios\nof counts in a high-energy band to counts in a low-energy\nband. Typically a hard colour (hardness ratio for two highenergy bands) is plotted against a soft colour (hardness ratio\nfor to low-energy bands). The X-ray equivalent of a colourmagnitude diagram is a hardness-intensity diagram, which\nplots a hardness ratio against the X-ray intensity (count s\u22121 )\nin some band. The location of the source in these diagrams\nprovides information about changes in the shape of the X-\n\n\f2\n\nK. O'Brien et al.\n\nray spectrum and intensity, which arise for example from\nchanges in the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star.\nIn the case of the Z-sources, they seem to move smoothly\nalong three distinct tracks, from the Horizontal Branch, the\nupper-most stroke, through the Normal Branch, the diagonal stroke, and onto the Flaring Branch, the lowest stroke,\na sequence that until recently has been interpreted as a\nmonotonic increase in the mass accretion rate from below to\nabove the Eddington limit (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989).\nThere is however mounting evidence that this simple relationship is not the whole story and that a further parameter\nis needed to fully describe the X-ray behaviour. This has\nbeen demonstrated most noticeably with the \"parallel lines\"\nphenomena, where the relationship between the X-ray luminosity and QPO frequency is valid on short timescales only,\nbut changes on the duration of days to weeks, indicating a\nsecond parameter is needed to fully characterise the X-ray\nemission of LMXBs (see van der Klis (2001) for a discussion\nof this phenomenon).\nThe position of the Z in the X-ray colour-colour diagram and the shapes of the soft and hard colour-intensity\ndiagrams evolve on a timescale of weeks (Kuulkers, van der\nKlis & Vaughan 1996). During this time Cygnus X-2 varies\nbetween three levels; a high, medium and low level, as defined by Kuulkers, van der Klis & Vaughan (1996). The low\nintensity level is rare and only observed in the binary phase\nrange 0.8-0.2, indicating it may be linked to a grazing eclipse\nof the X-ray emitting region by the mass donor star. More\nnormally, the system appears to move slowly between the\nmedium and high intensity levels. This can be seen in the\nRXTE ASM lightcurve, a section of which is shown in Figure 1. The source can be seen to move slowly between the\nmedium level, with a count rate of \u223c 30 counts/sec and the\nhigh level where the count rate is \u223c 50 coutns/sec. However,\nlarge, short timescale deviations from these levels can also\nbe seen. These sudden drops in the count rate are caused\nby motion along the Z-curve and are not thought to be related to the longer timescale changes (the so-called \"secular\nvariations\"). The upper edge of this envelope represents the\ncount rate at the Hard Vertex, between the Horizontal and\nNormal Branches, where the count rate is highest.\nBoth the colour-colour diagrams and colour-intensity\ndiagrams for the medium and high intensity levels are very\ndifferent. In the high intensity level, the hard colour intensity diagram shows linear, almost horizontal Horizontal and\nFlaring Branches, whilst in the medium level these branches\nare more curved. The Flaring Branch is also truncated during the High level, which has been interpreted as obscuration\nby material in the binary, whereas in the medium level, the\nFlaring Branch intensity varies smoothly with the X-ray intensity. It is thought that the truncation is most noticeable\nduring the Flaring Branch as it coincides with the highest\nmass accretion rate, which causes the inner disc to swell and\nshield our view of the X-ray emitting regions (see Kuulkers,\nvan der Klis & Vaughan (1996) for a more detailed description).\nCygnus X-2 exhibits Type I X-ray bursts (eg. Kuulkers,\nvan der Klis & van Paradijs (1995)), confirming the presence of a neutron star, as seen in many other neutron star\nbinaries, including the Z-source GX 17+2 (Kahn & Grindlay (1984), Kuulkers et al. (1997)). These bursts typically\nhave rise times of 0.1-10 seconds and are thought to be\n\nFigure 1. The RXTE All Sky Monitor lightcurve for Cygnus X2. The vertical lines show the beginning and end of the Keck and\nRXTE observations used in our analysis.\n\ndue to thermonuclear burning of accreted material on the\nsurface of the neutron star (Smale 1998). Unlike neutron\nstars, black holes have no stellar surface and Type I X-ray\nbursts are not observed. There is also tentative evidence\nfor a third periodicity in Cygnus X-2 with a period of 78\ndays, although the interpretation of this is complicated by\nthe changes in X-ray flux as Cygnus X-2 moves around the\ncolour-colour diagram. The long-term quasi-periodicity can\nbe seen in Figure 1, where the peak-to-peak separation is\n\u223c 30 \u2212 40d. Wijnands, Kuulkers & Smale (1996) associate\nthis periodicity with that of a precessing accretion disk, as\nseen in Hercules X-1 (Giacconi et al. 1973).\nA previous multi-wavelength campaign on Cygnus X-2\nduring June and October 1988, involving X-ray (Hasinger\net al. 1990), UV (Vrtilek et al. 1990), optical (van Paradijs\net al. 1990) and radio (Hjellming et al. 1990) observations,\nrevealed many interesting features of the correlated variability, which are summarized schematically in Figure 9 of\nHasinger et al. (1990). They found that there was a direct\ncorrelation between the UV and optical fluxes and the position on the Z-diagram, although the sampling of the optical and UV data (\u223c 100's of seconds) only allowed general\ntrends to be observed. They also found a more complicated\nbehaviour between the X-ray intensity and the position on\nthe Z diagram. In this series of papers we will build upon\nthese observations, with higher time resolution optical data\n(\u223c seconds), which enables us to observe the previously observed trends in much more detail.\nIn this paper, the first in the series, we shall discuss the\nobservations of the X-ray and optical spectral variability of\nCygnus X-2 in terms of broadband variability on timescales\nof 102\u22125 seconds. We will also go into some depth into the\ndata reduction tasks performed, which will be abridged in\nsubsequent papers. In subsequent papers, we will discuss the\nvariability of narrow band features in the optical spectra\nand how this is affected by the X-ray spectral state. We\nwill also discuss a simultaneous timing analysis of the data\nand the nature of the rapid (\u223c seconds) correlated X-ray\nand optical variability in terms of the time delayed optical\nemission relative to the driving X-ray variability.\n\n\fOptical and X-ray Variability in Cyg X-2\n2\n\n3\n\nDATA\n\nSimultaneous Keck and RXTE observations of Cygnus X-2\nwere taken during UT 1998 July 2-6 as part of our campaign\nto search for correlated optical and X-ray variability in X-ray\nbinaries. In this paper, we will show the optical data from\nthe first and last nights of our campaign, where atmospheric\nconditions were most favourable. An analysis of the entire Xray dataset showed that using only this subset did not reduce\nour coverage of the different spectral states of Cygnus X-2.\n\n2.1\n\nOptical\n\nThe optical data were taken using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS; Oke et al. (1995)) on the 10-m Keck\nII telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. A summary of the observations is given in Table 1. The LRIS was used with a 5.2\narcsecond slit masked with aluminized mylar tape to form\na square aperture. The 300/5000 grating used has a mean\ndispersion of 2.55 \u00c5/pixel in the range 3600\u00c5 - 9200\u00c5.\nWe used a novel data acquisition system, which reads\nout the CCD continuously, to obtain more than 220,000\nspectra of Cygnus X-2, in the form of continuous byte\nstreams lasting typically 50 minutes. The mean integration\ntime was measured to be 72.075ms and there is no dead-time\nbetween individual spectra.\nIn addition to the 2048-pixel spectrum, 25-pixel underscan and 75-pixel over-scan regions were used to measure the\nCCD bias level, which we subtracted from each spectrum.\nThe noise for a given pixel was calculated using a readout\nnoise of 6.3 e\u2212 and a gain of 4.7 e\u2212 /ADU. Cosmic rays were\nrejected with a threshold of 10 sigma from the de-biased\nframes. A master flatfield image was created by finding the\nmedian of 700 individual flatfield spectra. This image showed\nno deviations above 0.3 % in all but 3 pixels. It was decided\nthat it was therefore not necessary to flatfield individual\nspectra. Calibration arc spectra and spectra of the sky in\nthe region of the object were taken at regular intervals.\nThe background spectrum, which accounts for \u223c 0.9%\nof the total flux, conains two components; one from scattered\nlight within the spectrograph and a second from the sky\nbrightness. The scattered light level was measured from the\ncounts in the pixels below 3400\u00c5, where both the GRISM\nand atmospheric transmission are negligable. This level was\nremoved from all spectra and then the sky spectrum was\nsubtracted using the best fit to spectra taken of a blank sky\nfield. These sky spectra were taken at the beginning and\nend of the exposure, so that long timescale variations could\nbe detected. The mean and variable components of these\nspectra were found by creating a lightcurve for each pixel\nand extracting the mean and gradient of this lightcurve. In\norder to supress the pixel-to-pixel variations, the mean and\ngradient were then averaged in wavelength, with a running\nmedian filter of width 101 pixels. The gradient in time of the\ndata was found to be consistent with zero, indicating that\nthe spectrum was constant for the duration of the exposure\n(\u223c 50 minutes). This spectrum is more than a simple sky\nspectrum and contains both the spectrum of the sky backgound and an additional component thought to be due to\nscattered light within the spectrograph.\nThe wavelength calibration was accomplished by fitting\na second-order polynomial to 7 lines in a median spectrum\n\nFigure 2.

Arc spectra from the\nbeginning and end of the run were used to take into account any drifts in the wavelength scale. The wavelength\ncalibration was applied using the MOLLY spectral analysis\npackage.\nThe individual spectra of Cygnus X-2 were flux calibrated using exposures taken of the standard star Feige 67\n(Oke 1990). We fitted a low-order polynomial to the median\nspectrum of the observations of this standard star. The resulting fit was used as a flux calibration and again applied\nusing MOLLY. The average spectrum from observation 'G'\nis shown in Figure 2. Several emission and aborption features can be cleary seen and will be described in detail in\nPaper II.\n\n2.1.1\n\nTime calibration\n\nDue to the nature of the continuous stream of data, it was\nimpossible to attach accurate timemarks to each individual spectrum. Individual time marks were placed after every\nother spectrum using the computer clock. In order to establish an absolute time reference, secondary timestamps were\nobtained on many occasions during the 5-night observing\nrun. To create these timestamps, an incandescent lamp that\nilluminated the CCD was modulated in synch with WWVH\ntime signals. From these timestamps we found an ephemeris\nfor the observation and the mean exposure time. These were\nchecked against the computer's time marks and found to be\nin excellent agreement.\nThe input times were corrected to the solar system\nbarycentre, using the subroutines supplied by the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) working group on \"Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy\" (SOFA\u22c6 ). Finally, these\ntimes were converted to seconds since JD 2450996.0, in order\nto make the numbers more manageable.\nIn order to increase the signal-to-noise of the individual\n\u22c6 http://www.iau-sofa.rl.ac.uk/\n\n\f4\n\nK. O'Brien et al.\n\nspectra and make the data-set more manageable, the spectra\nwere binned in time by a factor of 14 to give 1646 binned\nspectra with a time resolution of 1.01 seconds.\n2.2\n\nX-ray\n\nThe X-ray data taken with the PCA onboard the RXTE\nsatellite covered 42 ksec of exposure time during UT 1998\nJuly 2-6. We have used a subset of this data, which amounts\nto 20.3 ksec and represents the times of simultaneous coverage during favorable atmospheric conditions. During this\ntime all 5 PCUs were switched on. The data were analysed using the ftools v5.1 software suite. The Standard-2\nmode data were used with a time resolution of 16 seconds to\ncreate colour-colour and hardness-intensity diagrams, and\nto study the simultaneous variability. The lightcurves were\nextracted, using ftools package saextrct, in 4 energy\nranges, using the Standard-2 channels 1-5, 6-12, 13-21 and\n22-39. This corresponds to 1.94 - 3.72 keV, 3.72 - 6.22 keV,\n6.22 - 9.46 keV and 9.46 - 16.02 keV. The times were corrected to the solar system barycentre using the ftools package faxbary. The minimum count rate of 4000 count s\u22121\nimplies that background subtraction was not necessary. The\ndeadtime is estimated to be < 2%, which is smaller than the\nvariability we are studying and therefore a deadtime correction was not applied to the X-ray lightcurves. The average\nspectrum during observations 'G' is shown in Figure 2.\nThe broadband X-ray spectral variations of Z-sources\nare most clearly shown in an X-ray colour-colour diagram.\nThese are shown for Cygnus X-2 in, e.g., Wijnands & van\nder Klis (2001). The colour-colour and hardness intensity\ndiagrams presented by them contain data from the 5 nights\nof observations. In this paper we present a subset of this\ndata for which we have simultaneous optical observations.\nThe colour-colour diagram from our RXTE observation is\nshown in Figure 3. The soft colour is defined as the intensity\nin the range 3.72 - 6.22 keV, divided by the intensity in the\nrange 1.94 - 3.72 keV. The hard colour is similarly defined\nas the intensity in the range 9.46 - 16.02 keV divided by the\nintensity in the range 6.22 - 9.46 keV.\n\n3\n\nTHE BROADBAND X-RAY SPECTRAL\nCHANGES\n\nCygnus X-2 can clearly be seen in Figure 3 to trace out\nall three branches of the Z-curve, beginning on the Horizontal Branch during the first night, then moving onto the\nlower Normal Branch and the Flaring Branch during the last\nnight. If motion along the 'Z' is due to changes in the mass\naccretion rate (see Hasinger et al. (1990)), we would infer\nthat \u1e40 increases from night to night.\nThe hardness intensity diagrams, which plot the Xray colour changes as a function of intensity show that\nthe hard colour varies smoothly with intensity whilst on a\ngiven branch, as expected from previous observations of the\nsource. The transition between the Normal Branch and the\nFlaring Branch, referred to as the soft vertex, is clearly seen,\nbut the Horizontal Branch to Normal Branch transition region, referred to as the hard vertex, is not covered in any of\nour observations.\nThe soft colour-intensity diagram also shows a linear\n\ntrend on the Horizontal and Normal Branches. This is interpreted as changes in the X-ray production mechanism\nas a function of the increasing mass accretion rate. The\nsoft colour-intensity diagram deviates from the expected linear relationship (see eg. Kuulkers, van der Klis & Vaughan\n(1996)) whilst on the Flaring Branch. The colour-intensity\ndiagrams are characteristic of the high intensity level colourintensity diagram described by Kuulkers, van der Klis &\nVaughan (1996), exhibiting an almost horizontal FB in the\nhard colour-intensity diagram.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nTHE SIMULTANEOUS X-RAY AND\nOPTICAL VARIABILITY IN CYGNUS X-2\nGeneral features of Night 1, UT 01-02/07/98\n\nThe simultaneous X-ray and optical observations of\nCygnus X-2 from Night 1 of our observations are shown\nin Figure 4. The position in the X-ray colour-colour diagram (the pluses in Figure 3) show that Cygnus X-2 was on\nthe Horizontal Branch throughout the night. It began the\nnight near the Hard Vertex, but by the end of the night had\nmoved along the Horizontal Branch away from the Hard\nVertex, which coincides with the lowest X-ray and optical\nfluxes. During these observations there is a general correlation between the X-ray and optical flux. In contrast to the\nNormal and Flaring Branch lightcurves shown in Figure 5\nand described in the next section, no rapid (10 0\u22122 seconds)\ncorrelated variability is seen on the Horizontal Branch. Even\nthe X-ray burst observed around t = 93, 000 secs shows no\noptical counterpart. (Correlated, time-delayed variability on\nthese timescales will be analysed in a subsequent paper in\nthis series.)\n\n4.2\n\nGeneral features of Night 5, UT 05-06/07/98\n\nAt the beginning of Night 5, Cygnus X-2 was on the Flaring Branch. During the night it moved off the Flaring and\nonto the Normal Branch, finishing approximately half-way\nbetween the Soft and Hard Vertices. The overall X-ray intensity is now anti-correlated with the optical flux, as shown in\nFigure 5. Although this might seem surprising, it is in fact\nthe same behaviour as reported by Hasinger et al. (1990)\nbetween the X-ray intensity and UV flux. Their interpretation for this was that the reprocessing material in the disk,\nwhich gives rise to much of the observed optical/UV emission, intercepts X-rays from a number of different lines of\nsight, whereas our observations are limited to the line of\nsight from the neutron star to the detector. As these lines of\nsight may have quite different fluxes, averaging over many\nof them gives a better indication of the bolometric X-ray\nflux and hence \u1e40 . They note that the observed X-ray flux\nis sensitive to both the changing spectrum of the source and\nany anisotropy in the X-ray emission. Perhaps the existence\nof anisotropic emission could also explain the lack of an optical counterpart to the X-ray burst, as the burst is seen by\nthe observer, but not the region of the binary responsible for\nreprocessing the X-ray photons into optical/UV photons.\n\n\fOptical and X-ray Variability in Cyg X-2\nFilename\n\nObservation\n\nNight\n\nXTE window\n\nK0010\nK0013\nK4005\nK4007\nK4009\nK4011\n\nA\nB\nC\nD,E\nF\nG\n\n1\n1\n5\n5\n5\n5\n\n1\n2\n1\n2,3\n4\n5\n\nUT at start\n10:48,\n13:15,\n09:08,\n10:05,\n11:42,\n13:17,\n\n02/07/98\n02/07/98\n06/07/98\n06/07/98\n06/07/98\n06/07/98\n\nElapsed time\n(secs)\n\nNumber of unbinned\nspectra\n\n1654\n3930\n1460\n3890\n3746\n1710\n\n23268\n58086\n20230\n46942\n51926\n23842\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

Top left, X-ray colour-colour diagram for Cygnus X-2, based on the RXTE PCA data between UT 01/07/98 - 06/07/98. The\ndata are taken from the Standard-2 mode, with a time resolution of 16 seconds. The soft colour is defined as the ratio of the intensities\nin the ranges 1.94 - 3.72 keV and 3.72 - 6.22 keV. The hard colour is the ratio of the intensities in the ranges 6.22 - 9.46 keV and 9.46 16.02 keV (an increase in colour means the spectrum hardens). Bottom left, the hardness intensity diagram for the hard colour and the\ntotal intensity. Top right, the hardness intensity diagram for the soft colour and the total intensity.

The time is seconds elapsed since JD 2450096.0, the beginning of the night. The time\nresolution of the lightcurves is 16 seconds. The relative sizes of the left and right panels has been chosen to keep the scale the same for\nboth lightcurves. The X-ray burst can clearly be seen at t = 93, 000 secs, with no optical counterpart.\n\n5\n\nTHE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE\nX-RAY AND OPTICAL DATA\n\nIn Figure 6 we plot the X-ray intensity in the soft (top panel)\nand hard (bottom panel) bands as a function of the optical\ncontinuum flux. A striking feature is the significant range\nin X-ray intensity IX that occurs at each optical flux (the\nerror bars are typically smaller than the markers in the plot).\nThis indicates there is not a simple one-to-one relationship\nbetween the X-ray and optical fluxes of Cygnus X-2. The\nrange over which IX varies, at a given optical flux (F\u03bd ),\nremains rather small on the Horizontal Branch (shown as\npluses in Figure 6), but it then increases dramatically as\nthe system progresses up the Normal and Flaring Branches\n(marked by dots and open circles respectively). It appears\nplausible from Figure 6 to define smooth upper and lower\nenvelopes representing the extreme values of IX that occur\n\nat each optical flux. These envelopes are indicated by the\nsolid and dashed lines on Figure 6.\nOn the basis of the optical and X-ray variability exhibited in Figure 6, we investigate here a decomposition of\nthe X-ray intensity IX into three spectral components, IF ,\nIB and IA , where the subscripts stand for Flaring, Baseline\nand Accretion respectively (see Section 5.1). This decomposition can be expressed mathematically as\n\nIX (F\u03bd ) = \u03b1(t) IF (F\u03bd ) + IB (F\u03bd ) + IA (F\u03bd ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1(t) is a coefficient to describe the variability in IF ,\nwith 0 \u2264 \u03b1(t) \u2264 1. The three components are discussed below and shown schematically in the lower panel of Figure 6.\n\n\fOptical and X-ray Variability in Cyg X-2\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. Top panel, the total X-ray intensity during the 5 RXTE visits (labeled C-G) from night 5. Bottom panel, the optical continuum\nflux in the range 5000 - 5800 \u00c5. The time is seconds elapsed since JD 2450996.0, the beginning of the first night of the run. The time\nresolution of the lightcurves is 16-seconds.\n\n5.1\n\nThe three components\n\nThe first component, IF , with F for \"flaring\", is associated\nwith the rapid variation between the bounds of the envelope.\nThe variability of this component is mimicked in the optical\nlightcurve, as can be seen in the correlated flares and dips\nduring Observations C and D, shown in Figure 5. In other\nwords, on the Normal and Flaring Branches, the area between the full and dashed lines in Figure 6 is filled in by\nthe source performing diagonal (correlated) strokes on the\ntimescale of 101\u22122 seconds.\nA second interesting feature in Figure 6 is the lower envelope or \"baseline\" in the range of IX when F\u03bd > 4.8 mJy.\nThis baseline in X-ray intensity is visited repeatedly by the\nsystem during observations C and D in Figure 5, where it\nappears to represent a level below which IX never goes. We\nnotice in Figure 6 that this floor in IX decreases as the optical flux rises. Furthermore, if we extrapolate that slope to\n\nlower optical flux it appears to predict the lowest IX we\nobserved on the Horizontal Branch, at Sz = 0. We therefore\ndraw a line across the diagram, and identify the X-ray intensity of this baseline component as IB , B for \"baseline\",\nwhere IB decreases linearly as the optical flux rises.\nThe third component is simply the difference between\nthe baseline intensity IB and the lower envelope of IX at\neach optical F\u03bd . This component first increases along the\nHorizontal Branch, and then decreases along the Normal\nand Flaring Branches. We refer to the X-ray intensity of\nthis component that varies smoothly with the optical flux\nas IA , \"A\" for accretion, since we suggest that it is related\nto the accreted material (see discussion).\nOur decomposition is somewhat arbitrary. For example, we could combine IB and IA into a single component\nwith a more complex dependence on optical flux. However,\nas described above, we believe that the morphology of the\n\n\f8\n\nK. O'Brien et al.\nvariability can cause spurious correlations, as is the case\nhere.\nThe variability outside of the envelope at low optical\nfluxes F\u03bd = 2.1 \u2212 2.2mJy is not understood and more data\nwill be needed in order to determine the cause of the noncorrelated variability.\n5.2\n\nFigure 6. Top, a plot of the logarithm of the Soft X-ray intensity (1.94 - 6.22 keV) versus optical continuum flux. Bottom,\nthe same plot for the Hard X-ray intensity (6.22 - 16.02 keV). The\nsolid, dotted and dot-dashed lines represent the limits of the three\ncomponents described in the text. The Normal, Horizontal and\nFlaring Branch points are represented by pluses, dots and open\ncircles respectively.\n\noptical and X-ray variations, especially the apparent floor\nin the IX , provides sufficient motivation to further explore\nour proposed 3-component decomposition.\nThere are several deviations outside this envelope,\nwhich we will describe on a case-by-case basis. The most\nobvious of these deviations occurs around F\u03bd = 4.3mJy,\nwhere IX is below the lower edge of the envelope. This deviation can be seen in the X-ray lightcurve in Figure 5 around\nt = 434, 000 secs in the form of a dip in the X-ray lightcurve\nthat has no optical counterpart. Such \"non-correlated\" dips\nhave been seen previously in Cygnus X-2 (Kuulkers, van der\nKlis & Vaughan 1996) and interpreted as momentary obscuration by material along the line of sight to the neutron star.\nThey are not expected to have an analogue in the optical\nlightcurve as the line of sight from the X-ray emitting region\nto the reprocessing region is different from the direct line of\nsight for the observer. Similar non-correlated dips are seen\nin the Flaring Branch observations, which result in the dips\nseen around F\u03bd = 4.2mJy, where the X-ray intensity drops\nto the lower \"floor\" level (described in the next section).\nAnother deviation, seen at the highest optical fluxes is\nassociated with the reprocessed flares seen during Observation C in Figure 5. While we would expect such correlated\nflares to remain within the envelope, as they do appear to\nhave X-ray analogues, we have not taken into account the\ntime delay between the X-ray and optical emission. This\ntime delay, which will be quantified in another paper in this\nseries, is most noticeable when the amplitude of the variability is largest on timescales similar to the time resolution\nof the data, as is the case on the Flaring Branch. This rapid\n\nThe spectra of the components\n\nComparing the upper and lower panels of Figure 6, showing the relationship between the X-ray and optical fluxes for\nthe soft and hard X-ray bands respectively, we see how the\n3 components depend on the X-ray band. The most striking feature of this is how the hard X-ray intensity (lower\npanel) reaches its maximum at lower F\u03bd than the soft X-ray\nintensity.\nIn order to determine the spectrum of each component\nand how it varies with the optical flux, we have sub-divided\nthe X-ray band into a total of four bands. These bands are\nthe same as those chosen to create the hardness ratios shown\nin Figure 3, namely 1.94 - 3.72 keV, 3.72 - 6.22 keV, 6.22 9.46 keV and 9.46 - 16.02 keV. The results of this decomposition are shown in Figure 7. IB (Top Panel) is seen to\nhave a roughly constant soft X-ray flux, while the Hard Xray flux drops steadily, leading to an overall softening of the\nspectrum. This is in contrast to IF (Bottom Panel), where\nthe soft flux varies most. IA shows the least spectral variability, showing only a change between the transition from\nthe Horizontal Branch to the Normal Branch.\n\n6\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have obtained a unique dataset from Keck II and RXTE\nand used it to investigate the simultaneous X-ray and optical\nvariability in Cygnus X-2. We have found that on timescales,\n\u223c 102\u22125 seconds, the X-ray and optical variability show a\npositive-correlation on the Horizontal Branch, changing to\nan anti-correlation on the Normal and Flaring Branches.\nHowever, on short timescales, \u223c 100\u22122 seconds , the optical lightcurves show correlated, yet time-delayed features\nof the X-ray lightcurves. This is as expected in a linear reprocessing model. (The short timescale correlated variability\nwill be discussed in more detail in a later paper.) The simultaneous X-ray and optical fluxes show a complicated correlation. Initially, whilst on the Horizontal Branch they show\na fairly tight correlation. Then, when Cygnus X-2 is on the\nNormal Branch, the X-ray and optical flux changes become\nanti-correlated, whilst still exhibiting a strong correlation.\nThen, around the middle of the Normal Branch, the correlated variability changes again: the correlation becomes\nweaker with large changes in both the X-ray and optical\nvariability.\nWe have used the simultaneous X-ray intensity and\noptical flux measurements to characterise the spectrum in\nterms of the three components IB , IA and IF , corresponding\nto baseline, accretion and flaring components. It is clear that\nthere are different phases in the behaviour of Cygnus X-2,\nrepresented by the different branches of the colour-colour\ndiagram. This would appear to represent the complex interdependency of more than one component of the X-ray emission.\n\n\fOptical and X-ray Variability in Cyg X-2\n\n9\n\ndrops into this region during non-correlated X-ray dips it\ndoes vary on these timescales.\n(iii) Component IF :\nIF was defined such that it contains most of the 101\u22122 seconds variability, as expressed by \u03b1(t) in Equation 1. The\ninstantaneous X-ray intensity appears to change randomly\nwithin its envelope, except during X-ray bursts and noncorrelated dips, which we therefore do not associate with\nvariations in IF . The spectrum of this component shows a\nhighly variable soft intensity, so that the total spectrum softens with increasing Sz .\n\nFigure 7. The spectra of the three identified components in the\nX-ray spectra.The components are IB , IA and IF from top to\nbottom panel respectively. The spectra were calculated when the\noptical continuum flux equaled 2.3 (pluses, solid line), 2.8 (stars,\ndashed line), 3.7 (circles, dot-dashed line), 4.05 (crosses, dotted\nline), 4.4 (squares, dot-dot-dot-dashed line), 4.75 (triangle, solid\nline) and 5.1 (diamond, dashed line). The spectra for IA when F\u03bd\n= 2.3 & 5.1 are set to zero, as can be seen from Figure 6.\n\n(i) Component IB :\nAs we have said earlier, IB appears to describe the lowest\npossible X-ray intensity, or \"baseline\" as function of the rank\nnumber, Sz . The intensity is seen to fall to this level, but\nnot below it, at both extremes of the Z-curve and possibly\nwhen the neutron star is momentarily obscured by intervening material. Component B smoothly softens between the\nobservations on the Horizontal and Flaring Branches, as a\nresult of a drop in intensity, predominantly in the hardest\nenergy range.\n(ii) Component IA :\nThe spectral shape of IA remains constant while on the\nHorizontal Branch and also, with a different slope, on the\nNormal and Flaring Branches, only changing in flux while on\neither branch. The spectrum is seen to change between the\nHorizontal and Normal/Flaring Branches, when the sense of\nthe correlation changes, with a harder spectrum on the Horizontal Branch. Like IB , this component is relatively constant\non timescales of 102\u22123 seconds. However, when the intensity\n\nIF , which represents the rapidly varying material is the\nsoftest of the three components and could be associated with\nmaterial in a hot inner disc. At a given optical flux and\nhence inferred mass transfer rate, the flux in this component\nvaries rapidly and appears to drive much of the rapid optical\nresponse, as can be seen by the correlated X-ray and optical\nflares in observations C and D. Such rapid variability could\nbe associated with inhomogeneities in the accretion flow.\nIA , whose flux varies considerably, but with little change\nin the spectrum may be associated with the emission from\nthe surface of the neutron star. Such variability could then\nbe caused by the changing obscuration of the inner regions\nof the accretion flow by optically thick material.\nHowever, no complete physical interpretation of the decomposition is possible as yet. This is particularly evident\nwhen considering IB , which represents the lowest ('Baseline') level is the spectrum of the source when the accretion\nrate is at its lowest and highest levels. At these times there\nwill be contributions from many regions within the binary,\nleading to a complicated spectrum. This component may\ninclude the non-thermal emission, which has been observed\nto increase with decreasing \u1e40 . Observations of similar variability of the so-called hard-tail in Cygnus X-2 (Di Salvo\net al. 2002) and other Z-sources would appear to support the\nexistence of this variable hard component (Di Salvo et al.\n2000; Frontera et al. 1998). In addition to this, it has been\nobserved that the radio emission, which is linked to the mass\noutflow from the system, possibly in the form of a jet (Fender\n& Hendry 2000), is greatest at the lowest Sz (Penninx et al.\n1988) and hence optical flux, as seen in our observations.\nThe limited amount of data make it impossible to assess the importance of effects such as the binary phase and\nthe long-term periodicity on IA and indeed the other two\ncomponents. However, it is intriguing that such a simple\ndecomposition leads to three distinct components that are\nsuggestive of the three regions thought to affect the X-ray\nemission in neutron star X-ray binaries.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank John Cromer for writing, testing, and loading the\nsoftware that allowed the LRIS CCD to read out continuously, and Bob Leach for helpful discussions.
