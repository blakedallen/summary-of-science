Cuffaro\n\n1\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe significance of the phenomenon of quantum entanglement-wherein the most precise\ncharacterisation of a quantum system composed of previously interacting subsystems does\nnot necessarily include a precise characterisation of those subsystems-has been at the forefront of the debate over the conceptual foundations of quantum theory, almost since that\ntheory's inception. It is the distinguishing feature of quantum theory, for some (Schr\u00f6dinger,\n1935).1 For others, it is evidence for the incompleteness of that theory (Einstein, Podolsky, & Rosen,\n1935).2 For yet others, the possibility of entangled quantum systems implies that physical\nreality is essentially non-local (Stapp, 1997).3 For almost all, it has been, and continues to\nbe, an enigma requiring a solution.\nFor most of the history of quantum theory, serious investigation into the significance and\nimplications of entanglement has been conducted mainly by philosophers of physics and by\na few philosophically-minded theoretical and experimental physicists interested in foundational issues. With the advent of quantum information theory, this has begun to change. In\nquantum information theory, quantum mechanical systems are utilised to implement communications protocols and computational algorithms that are faster and more efficient than\nany of their known classical counterparts. Because it is almost surely the case that one or\nmore of the fundamental distinguishing aspects of quantum mechanics is responsible for this\n'quantum advantage', quantum information theory has precipitated an explosion of physical\nresearch into the traditionally foundational issues of quantum theory.\nOf the many and varied applications of quantum information theory, perhaps the most\nfascinating is the sub-field of quantum computation. In this sub-field, computational algorithms are designed which utilise the resources available in quantum systems in order to\ncompute solutions to computational problems with, in some cases, exponentially fewer resources than any known classical algorithm. A striking example of this so-called 'quantum\nspeedup' is Shor's algorithm (Shor, 1997) for factoring integers. A basic distinction, in computational complexity theory, is between those computational problems that are amenable\nto an efficient solution in terms of time and space resources, and those that are not. Easy\n(or 'tractable', 'feasible', 'efficiently solvable', etc.) problems are those which involve resources bounded by a polynomial in the input size, n (nc time steps, for instance, where c\nis some constant). Hard problems are those which are not easy; they are those problems\nwhose solution requires resources that are 'exponential' in n, i.e., that grow faster than any\npolynomial in n.4,5 The factoring problem is believed to be hard, classically, and indeed,\nmuch of current Internet security relies on this fact. Shor's quantum algorithm for factoring\n1\n\nFor some more recent speculation on the the distinguishing feature(s) of quantum mechanics, see, for\ninstance, Clifton et al. (2003); Myrvold (2010).\n2\nFor further discussion, and for Einstein's later refinements of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paper's\nmain argument, see Howard (1985).\n3\nFor responses to Stapp's view and for further discussion, see: Unruh (1999); Mermin (1998); Stapp\n(1999).\n4\nAs this class of problems includes those solvable in, for instance, nlog n steps, this convention abuses,\nsomewhat, the term exponential, hence my use of inverted commas.\n5\nAs we will discuss in more detail later, the easy-hard distinction is not meant to reflect any deep\nmathematical truth about the nature of computational algorithms, but is rather meant as a practical characterisation of what we normally associate with efficiency.\n\n1\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nintegers, however, makes the factoring problem efficiently solvable.\nWhile the fact of quantum computational speedup is almost beyond doubt,6 the source\nof quantum speedup is still a matter of debate. Candidate explanations of quantum speedup\nrange from the purported ability of quantum computers to perform multiple function evaluations simultaneously (Deutsch, 1997; Duwell, 2004; Hewitt-Horsman, 2009),7 to the purported ability of a quantum computer to compute a global property of a function without\nevaluating any of its values (e.g. Steane, 2003; Bub, 2010).\nIn most of these candidate explanations, the fact that quantum mechanical systems can\nsometimes exhibit entanglement plays an important role. On A.M. Steane's view, for instance, quantum entanglement allows one to manipulate the correlations between the values\nof a function without manipulating those values themselves. For proponents of the many\nworlds explanation, on the other hand, though they consider computational worlds to be\nthe main component in the explanation of quantum speedup, they nevertheless view entanglement as indispensable to its analysis (Hewitt-Horsman, 2009, 889). It is thus somewhat\ndisconcerting that recent physical research seems to suggest that entanglement, rather than\nbeing indispensable, may be irrelevant to the general explanation of quantum speedup.\nLogically, entanglement may play the role of either a necessary or a sufficient condition\n(or both) in an overall explanation of quantum speedup. I address the question of whether\nentanglement may be said to be a sufficient condition elsewhere (Cuffaro, 2013). As for the\nassertion that entanglement is a necessary component in the explanation of speedup, this\nseems, prima facie, to be supported8 by a result due to Jozsa & Linden (2003), who prove\nthat for quantum algorithms which utilise pure states, \"the presence of multi-partite entanglement, with a number of parties that increases unboundedly with input size, is necessary\nif the quantum algorithm is to offer an exponential speed-up over classical computation\"\n(2003, p. 2014). When we consider quantum algorithms which utilise mixed states, however,\nthen there appear to be counterexamples to the assertion that one must appeal to quantum\nentanglement in order to explain quantum speedup. In particular, Biham et al. (2004) have\nshown that it is possible to achieve a modest (sub-exponential) speedup using unentangled\nmixed states. Further, Datta et al. (2005, 2008) have shown that it is possible to achieve\nan exponential speedup using mixed states that contain only a vanishingly small amount of\nentanglement. In the latter case, further investigation has suggested to some that quantum\ncorrelations other than entanglement may be playing a more important role. One quantity\nin particular, quantum discord, appears to be intimately connected to the speedup that is\npresent in the algorithm in question. In light of these results, it is tempting to conclude that\nit is not necessary to appeal to entanglement at all in order to explain quantum computational speedup and that the investigative focus should shift to the physical characteristics of\n6\n\nJust as with other important problems in computational complexity theory, such as the P = NP\nproblem, there is currently no proof, though it is very strongly suspected to be true, that the class of\nproblems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer is larger than the class of problems efficiently solvable\nby a classical computer.\n7\nFor criticisms of the version of this view that takes this parallel computation to occur in many parallel\nuniverses, see, for instance, Steane (2003); Duwell (2007); Cuffaro (2012).\n8\nWhat I take to be supported by Jozsa & Linden's result is the claim that entanglement is required in\norder to explain quantum speedup. As we will discuss further in \u00a73.2, this is distinct from the claim that\none requires an entangled quantum state in order to achieve quantum speedup.\n\n2\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nquantum discord or some other such quantum correlation measure instead.\nIn this paper I will argue that this conclusion is premature and misguided, for as I will\nshow below, there is an important sense in which entanglement can indeed be said to be\nnecessary for the explanation of the quantum speedup obtainable from both of these mixedstate quantum algorithms.\nI will proceed as follows. After introducing the concept of entanglement and how it is\nquantified in \u00a72, I introduce the necessity of entanglement for explanation thesis in \u00a73.2.\nIn \u00a73.3, I show how what looks like a counter-example to the necessity of entanglement for\nexplanation thesis for pure states-the fact that certain important quantum algorithms can\nbe expressed so that their states are never entangled-is instead evidence for this thesis.\nThen, in \u00a74, I examine the more serious challenges to the necessity of entanglement for\nexplanation thesis posed by the cases of sub-exponential speedup with unentangled mixed\nstates (\u00a74.1) and exponential speedup with mixed states containing only a vanishingly small\nquantity of entanglement (\u00a74.3).\nStarting with the first type of counter-example, I begin by arguing that pure quantum\nstates should be taken to provide a more fundamental representation of quantum systems\nthan mixed states. I then show that when one considers the initially mixed state of the quantum computer as representing the space of its possible pure state preparations, the speedup\nobtainable from the computer can be seen as stemming from the fact that the quantum\ncomputer evolves some of these possible pure state preparations to entangled states-that\nthe quantum speedup of the computer can be seen as arising from the fact that it implements\nan entangling transformation.\nAs for the second type of counter-example, where exponential speedup is achieved with\nonly a vanishingly small amount of entanglement, and where it is held by some that another type of non-classical correlation, quantum discord, is responsible for the speedup of\nthe quantum computer: I argue that, first, it is misleading to characterise discord as indicative of non-classical correlations. I then appeal to recent work done by Fanchini et al.\n(2011), Brodutch & Terno (2011), and Cavalcanti et al. (2011) who show, respectively, that\nwhen one considers the 'purified' state representation of the quantum computer, there is\na conservation relation between discord and entanglement, and indeed that there is just as\nmuch entanglement in such a representation as there is discord in the mixed state representation; that entanglement must be shared between two parties in order to bilocally implement\nany bipartite quantum gate; and that entanglement is directly involved in the operational\ndefinition of quantum discord.\nGiven Jozsa & Linden's proof of the necessary presence of an entangled state for exponential speedup using pure states, and given the fundamentality of pure states as representations\nof quantum systems, the burden of proof is upon those who would deny the necessity of entanglement for explanation thesis to show either by means of a counter-example or by some\nother more principled method that it is false. Neither of the counter-examples discussed\nin this paper succeeds in doing so. We should conclude, therefore, that the necessity of\nentanglement for explanation thesis is true.\n\n3\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\n2\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nPreliminaries\n\n2.1\n\nQuantum entanglement\n\nConsider the following representation of the joint state of two qubits:9\n|\u03c8i = |0i \u2297 |0i + |0i \u2297 |1i + |1i \u2297 |0i + |1i \u2297 |1i.\nThis expression for the overall state of the system represents the fact that the two qubits\nare in an equally weighted superposition of the four joint states (a)-(d) below:\n\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nq1\nq2\n|0i |0i\n|0i |1i\n|1i |0i\n|1i |1i.\n\nThis particular state is a separable state, for it can, alternatively, be expressed as a product\nof the pure states of its component systems, as follows:\n|\u03c8i = (|0i + |1i) \u2297 (|0i + |1i).\nNot all quantum mechanical states can be expressed as product states of their component\nsystems, and thus not all quantum mechanical states are separable. Here are four such\n'entangled' states:10\n|00i + |11i\n\u221a\n2\n|00i \u2212 |11i\n\u221a\n|\u03a6\u2212 i =\n2\n|01i + |10i\n\u221a\n|\u03a8+ i =\n2\n|01i \u2212 |10i\n\u221a\n.\n|\u03a8\u2212 i =\n2\n|\u03a6+ i =\n\nThe skeptical reader is encouraged to convince himself that it is impossible to re-express\nany of these states as a product state of two qubits. They are called the Bell states, and\nI will refer to a pair of qubits jointly in a Bell state as a Bell pair.11 Maximally entangled\n9\n\nA qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit. It can be physically\nrealised by any two-level quantum mechanical system. Like a bit, it can be \"on\": |1i or \"off\": |0i, but unlike\na bit it can also be in a superposition of these values.\n10\nFrom now on, I will usually, for brevity, omit the tensor product symbol from expressions for states of\nmulti-particle systems; i.e., |\u03b1\u03b2i and |\u03b1i|\u03b2i should be understood as shorthand forms of |\u03b1i \u2297 |\u03b2i.\n11\nThese are also sometimes referred to as 'EPR pairs'. EPR stands for Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen.\nIn their seminal 1935 paper, EPR famously used states analogous to the Bell states to argue that quantum\nmechanics is incomplete.\n\n4\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nstates,12 such as these, completely specify the correlations between outcomes of experiments\non their component qubits without specifying anything regarding the outcome of a single\nexperiment on one of the qubits. For instance, in the singlet state (i.e., |\u03a8\u2212 i), outcomes of\nexperiments on the first and second qubits are perfectly anti-correlated with one another. If\none performs, say, a \u1e91 experiment on one qubit of such a system, then if the result is |0i,\na \u1e91 experiment on the other qubit will, with certainty, yield an outcome of |1i, and vice\nversa. In general, the expectation value for joint measurements on the two qubits is given\nby \u2212m\u0302 * n\u0302 = \u2212 cos \u03b8, where m\u0302, n\u0302 are unit vectors representing the orientations of the two\nexperimental devices, and \u03b8 is the difference in these orientations. Any single \u1e91 experiment\non just one of the two qubits, however, will yield |0i or |1i with equal probability.\nWe will put to one side the question of the physical significance of quantum entanglement.\nI discuss this at greater length in Chapters 4 and 5 of Cuffaro (2013). For the purposes of\nthis paper it is most appropriate to give as minimal and uncontroversial a characterisation\nof entanglement as possible.\n\n2.2\n\nEntangled mixed states\n\nThe concepts of separability and of entanglement are also applicable to so-called 'mixed\nstates'. To illustrate the concept of a mixed state, imagine that one draws a ball from an\nurn into which balls of different types have been placed, and that the probability of drawing\na ball of type i is pi . Corresponding to the outcome i, we then prepare a given system S\nin the pure state |\u03c8i i, representable by the density operator \u03c1Si = |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |. After preparing\n\u03c1Si , we then discard our record of the result of the draw. The resulting state of the overall\nsystem will be the mixed state:\nX\n\u03c1=\npi \u03c1Si .\n(2.1)\ni\n\nA mixed state is separable if it can be expressed as a mixture of pure product states, and\nentangled otherwise. In general, determining whether a mixed state of the form (2.1) is an\nentangled state is difficult, because in general the decomposition of mixtures is non-unique.\nFor instance, the reader can verify that a mixed state represented by the density operator\n\u03c1, prepared as a mixture of pure states in the following way:\n3\n1\n\u03c1 = |0ih0| + |1ih1|,\n4\n4\ncan also be equivalently prepared as:\n1\n1\n\u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| + |\u03c6ih\u03c6|,\n2\n2\nwhere\n|\u03c8i \u2261\n\nr\n\n3\n|0i +\n4\n\nr\n\n1\n|1i,\n4\n\n|\u03c6i \u2261\n\n12\n\nr\n\n3\n|0i \u2212\n4\n\nr\n\n1\n|1i.\n4\n\nNote that not all entangled states are maximally entangled states. We will discuss this in more detail\nshortly.\n\n5\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nThis is so because both state preparations yield an identical density matrix representation\n(in the computational basis); i.e.,:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3/4 0\n.\n0 1/4\nAs we will see in more detail later, a system that is prepared as a mixture of entangled\nstates will sometimes yield the same density operator representation as a system prepared\nas a mixture of pure product states.\n\n2.3\n\nQuantifying entanglement\n\nEntanglement is a potentially useful resource for quantum information processing. Masanes\n(2006) has shown, for instance, that for any non-separable state \u03c1, some other state \u03c3 is\ncapable of having its teleportation fidelity enhanced by \u03c1's presence.13 Given this, it is\nuseful to be able to quantify the amount of entanglement contained in a given state. In\norder to do this, we employ so-called entanglement measures. Using such measures, it is\neasy to see, for instance, that the state\nr\nr\n1\n2\n|01i +\n|10i,\n(2.2)\n|\u03c6i =\n3\n3\nthough entangled, is not a maximally entangled state (unlike the Bell states we encountered\nin \u00a72.1, which are maximally entangled). This is explained in more detail in Cuffaro (2013),\nwhere a description of various entanglement measures is also given. This can also be found\nin Plenio & Virmani (2007).\n\n2.4\n\nPurification\n\nEvery mixed state can be thought of as the result of taking the partial trace of a pure state\nacting on a larger Hilbert space. In particular,\nfor a mixed state \u03c1A acting on a Hilbert\nP\nspace HA , with spectral decomposition\np\n|kihk|\nfor some orthonormal basis {|ki}, a\nk k\npurification (in general non-unique) of \u03c1A may be given by\nX\u221a\n|\u03c8AB i =\npk |kA i \u2297 |kB i \u2208 HA \u2297 HB ,\nk\n\nwhere HB is a copy of HA . We then have \u03c1A = trB (|\u03c8AB ih\u03c8AB |), with |\u03c8AB i an entangled\nstate.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nEntanglement in the quantum computer\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm\n\nDeutsch's problem (Deutsch, 1985) is the problem to determine whether a given function\nf : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1} is constant or balanced.

Its quantum solution is given\nby the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (Deutsch & Jozsa, 1992). In Cleve et al.'s improved version\n(Cleve et al., 1998), the algorithm begins by initialising the quantum registers of the computer to |0n i|1i, after which we apply a Hadamard transformation14 to all n + 1 qubits, so\nthat:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n|0i \u2212 |1i\nH\nn\nn\n\u221a\n|0 i|1i \u2212\n\u2192\n(|0i + |1i)\n2n/2\n2\n!\u0012\nn \u22121\n\u0013\n2X\n|0i \u2212 |1i\n1\n\u221a\n.\n(3.1)\n=\n|xi\n2n/2 x\n2\nThe unitary transformation,\nUf (|xi|yi) =df |xi|y \u2295 f (x)i,\n\n(3.2)\n\nis then applied, which has the effect:15\nUf\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n1\n2n/2\n\nn \u22121\n2X\n\n(\u22121)\n\nf (x)\n\nx\n\n|xi\n\n!\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|0i \u2212 |1i\n\u221a\n.\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nIf f is constant and = 0, this, along with a Hadamard transformation applied to the first\nn qubits, will result in:\n!\n2n \u22121\n1 X\nH n \u2297I\n|xi\n|\u2212i\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2192 |0n i|\u2212i,\nf =0:\n2n/2 x\n\u221a\nwhere |\u2212i =df |0i\u2212|1i\n.

In\nsum, if the function is constant, then z = 0 with certainty, and if the function is balanced,\nz 6= 0 with certainty. In either case, the probability of success of the algorithm is 1, using\nonly a single invocation. This is exponentially faster than any known classical solution.\n\n3.2\n\nThe necessity of entanglement for explanation thesis\n\nIn the literature on quantum computation (cf. Ekert & Jozsa 1998; Steane 2003) it is often\nsuggested that entanglement, such as that present in states like (3.3), is required if a quantum\nalgorithm is to be capable of achieving a speedup over its classical alternatives. I will call\nthis the necessity of an entangled state thesis (NEST). I will call the related claim that\nentanglement is a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup the necessity\nof entanglement for explanation thesis (NEXT).17\nNote that although the NEXT is related to the NEST, these two claims are not strictly\nspeaking identical. As we will see in \u00a74.1, it is possible for the NEXT to be true even if\nthe NEST is false (in the technical sense of \u00a72.2), and it is not incoherent to argue that the\nNEXT is false by citing, as a counter-example, a quantum computer whose state is always\nentangled, as we shall see in \u00a74.3.\n\n3.3\n\nDe-quantisation\n\nAt first sight the following consideration seems problematic for both the NEST and the\nNEXT. Consider the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (cf. \u00a73.1) for the special case of n = 1. This\ncase is essentially a solution for Deutsch's problem. Deutsch's (1985) original solution to this\nproblem is regarded as the first quantum algorithm ever developed and as the first example\nof what has since come to be known as quantum speedup. If one considers the steps of\nthe algorithm as given in \u00a73.1, however, then the reader can confirm that, when n = 1, at\nno time during the computation are the two qubits employed actually entangled with one\nanother. The thesis that entanglement is a necessary condition for quantum speedup thus\nseems false. But the situation is not as dark for the NEST and the NEXT as it appears,\nsince for the case of n = 1, it is also the case that the problem can be 'de-quantised', i.e.,\nsolved just as efficiently using classical means.\n16\n\nTo illustrate, consider the case where n = 2. After applying Uf , the computer will be in the state:\n(|00i \u2212 |01i + |10i \u2212 |11i)|\u2212i. Applying a Hadamard transform to the two input qubits will yield:\n\u0010\n(|00i + |01i + |10i + |11i) \u2212 (|00i \u2212 |01i + |10i \u2212 |11i)\n\u0011\n+ (|00i + |01i \u2212 |10i \u2212 |11i) \u2212 (|00i \u2212 |01i \u2212 |10i + |11i) |\u2212i\n= (0|00i + . . .)|\u2212i.\n\n17\n\nThe attentive reader who has noticed that there is actually no entanglement in (3.3) when n = 1 will be\nsomewhat puzzled by both of these theses. In fact, as we will see, entanglement will only appear for n \u2265 3.\nIn what follows I will argue, however, that this turns out to be evidence for, not against, the NEXT, and\nindeed does not contradict the NEST. This will be clarified in the next section.\n\n8\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nOne method for doing this (cf. Abbott, 2012) is with a computer which utilises the\ncomplex numbers {1, i} as a computational basis in lieu of {|0i, |1i}. A complex number\nz \u2208 C can be written as z = a + bi, where a, b \u2208 R, and thus can be expressed as a\nsuperposition of the basis elements in much the same way as a qubit.18 The algorithm\nproceeds in the following way. We first note that the action of Uf on the first n qubits in\nEq. (3.3) can, for the case of n = 1, be expressed as:19\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u221a (\u22121)f (0) |0i + (\u22121)f (1) |1i\n2\n\u0011\n(\u22121)f (0) \u0010\nf (0)\u2295f (1)\n= \u221a\n|0i + (\u22121)\n|1i .\n2\nWe now define an operator Cf , analogously to Uf , that acts on a complex number as follows:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nCf (a + bi) = (\u22121)f (0) a + (\u22121)f (0)\u2295f (1) bi .\n\nWhen f is constant, the reader can verify that Cf (z) = \u00b1(a+ bi) = \u00b1z. When f is balanced,\nCf (z) = \u00b1(a \u2212 bi) = \u00b1z \u2217 . Multiplying by z/2 so as to project our output back on to the\ncomputational basis, we find, for the elementary case of z = 1 + i, that\nf constant :\nf balanced :\n\n1\nz\n2\n\n* \u00b1z = \u00b1i\n1\nz * \u00b1z \u2217 = \u00b11.\n2\n\nThus for any z, if the result of applying Cf is imaginary, then f is constant, else if the result\nis real, then f is balanced (indeed, by examining the sign we will even be able to tell which\nof the two balanced or two constant functions f is). This algorithm is just as efficient as its\nquantum counterpart.\nIt can similarly be shown (cf. Abbott, 2012) that no entanglement is present in (3.3)\nwhen n = 2, and that for this case also it is possible to solve the problem efficiently using\nclassical means. When n \u2265 3, however, (3.2) is an entangling evolution and (3.3) is an\nentangled state. Unsurprisingly, it is no longer possible to define an operator Cf analogous\nto Uf that takes product states to product states, and it is no longer possible to produce an\nequally efficient classical counterpart to the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (cf. Abbott, 2012).\nIndeed, for the general case, Abbott has shown that a quantum algorithm can always\nbe efficiently de-quantised whenever the algorithm does not entangle the input states. Far\nfrom calling into question the role of entanglement in quantum computational speedup, the\nfact that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm does not require entanglement to succeed for certain\nspecial cases actually provides (since in these cases it can be de-quantised) evidence for both\nthe NEST and the NEXT.\n18\n\nRegarding the physical realisation of such a computer, note that complex numbers can be used, for\ninstance, to describe the impedances of electrical circuits and that we can apply the superposition theorem\nto their analysis.\n19\nNote that, since f (0) = f (0), (\u22121)f (0)\u2295f (0)\u2295f (1) = (\u22121)f (1) .\n\n9\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\n4\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nChallenges to the necessity of entanglement for explanation thesis\n\nIn their own analysis of de-quantisation, Jozsa & Linden (2003) similarly find that, for pure\nquantum states, \"the presence of multi-partite entanglement, with a number of parties\nthat increases unboundedly with input size, is necessary if the quantum algorithm is to\noffer an exponential speed-up over classical computation.\"20 In the same article, however,\nJozsa & Linden speculate as to whether it may be possible to achieve exponential speedup,\nwithout entanglement, using mixed states. In fact, as we will now see, it is possible to achieve\na modest (i.e., sub-exponential) speedup using unentangled mixed states. As I will argue,\nhowever, entanglement nevertheless plays an important role in the computational ability of\nthese states, despite their being unentangled in the technical sense of \u00a72.2. Thus, while such\ncounter-examples demonstrate the falsity of the NEST, they do not demonstrate the falsity\nof the NEXT.\n\n4.1\n\nThe mixed-state Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm\n\nWe will call a 'pseudo-pure-state' of n qubits any mixed state that can be written in the\nform:\n{n}\n\n\u03c1PPS \u2261 \u03b5|\u03c8ih\u03c8| + (1 \u2212 \u03b5)I ,\nwhere |\u03c8i is a pure state on n qubits, and I is defined as the totally mixed state (1/2n )I2n .\nIt can be shown that such a state is separable (cf. \u00a72.2) and remains so under unitary\nevolution just so long as\n1\n\u03b5<\n.\n1 + 22n\u22121\nNow consider the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm once again (cf. \u00a73.1). This time, however, let\nus replace the initial pure state |0n i|1i with the pseudo-pure state:\n\u03c1 = \u03b5|0n i|1ih0n |h1| + (1 \u2212 \u03b5)I .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe algorithm will continue as before, except that this time our probability of success will\nnot be unity.\nTo illustrate: assume that the system represented by \u03c1 has been prepared in the way\nmost naturally suggested by (4.1); i.e., that with probability \u03b5, it is prepared as the pure\nstate |0n i|1i, and with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5, it is prepared as the completely mixed state I .\nNow imagine that we write some of the valid Boolean functions f : {0, 1}n \u2192 {0, 1} onto\nballs which we then place into an urn, and assume that these consist of an equal number of\nconstant and balanced functions. We select a ball from the urn and then test the algorithm\nwith this function to see if the algorithm successfully determines f 's type.\nConsider the case when f is a constant function. In this case, we will say the algorithm\nsucceeds whenever it yields the bit string z = 0. We know, from \u00a73.1, that the algorithm\n20\n\nFor some earlier results relating to specific classes of algorithms, see Linden & Popescu (2001);\nBraunstein & Pati (2002).

Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nwill certainly succeed (i.e., with probability 1) when the system is actually in the pure state\n|0n i|1i initially. Given our particular state preparation procedure, the system is in this state\nwith probability \u03b5. The rest of the time (i.e., with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5), the system is in the\ncompletely mixed state I . In this latter case, since there are 2n possible values that can be\nobtained for z, the probability of successfully obtaining z = 0 will be 1/2n . Thus the overall\nprobability of success associated with the system when f is constant is:\nP (z = 0|f is constant) = \u03b5 + (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/2n .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe probability of failure is:\n\n2n \u2212 1\n* (1 \u2212 \u03b5).\n(4.3)\n2n\nIn the case where f is balanced, a result of z 6= 0 represents success, and the respective\nprobabilities of success and failure are:\n2n \u2212 1\nP (z 6= 0|f is balanced) = \u03b5 +\n* (1 \u2212 \u03b5),\n(4.4)\n2n\nP (z = 0|f is balanced) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5)/2n .\n(4.5)\nP (z 6= 0|f is constant) =\n\nNote that as I mentioned in \u00a72.2, mixed states can in general be prepared in a variety of\nways. What I have above called the 'most natural' state preparation procedure associated\nwith (4.1), in particular, is only one of many possible state preparations that will yield an\nidentical density matrix \u03c1. For ease of exposition, and in order to see clearly why Eqs. (4.24.5) hold, it was easiest to assume, as I did above, that the system has been prepared in the\nway most naturally suggested by (4.1). But note that there is no loss of generality here; the\nidentities (4.2-4.5) do not depend on the fact that we have used this particular preparation\nprocedure.\nIn any case, consider the alternative to the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm of performing classical function calls on f with the object of determining f 's type. The reader should convince\nherself that a single such call, regardless of the result, will not change the probability of\ncorrectly guessing the type of the function f . Thus the amount of information about f 's\ntype that is gained from a single classical function call is zero.21 On the other hand, as we\nshould expect given (4.2-4.5), for the mixed-state version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm,\nit can be shown that the information gained from a single invocation of the algorithm is\ngreater than zero for all positive \u03b5, and that this is the case even when \u03b5 < 1+212n\u22121 ; i.e., the\nthreshold below which \u03c1 no longer qualifies as an entangled state. Indeed, this is the case\neven when \u03b5 is arbitrarily small (cf. Biham et al., 2004), although the information gain in\nthis case is likewise vanishingly small.\n\n4.2\n\nExplaining speedup in the mixed-state Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm\n\nThe first question that needs to be answered here is whether the sub-exponential gain in\nefficiency that is realised by the mixed-state Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm should qualify as quan21\n\nThis information gain is referred to as the mutual information between two variables (in this case,\nbetween the type of the function and the result of a function call). For more on the mutual information and\nother information-theoretic concepts, see Nielsen & Chuang (2000).\n\n11\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\ntum speedup at all. On the one hand, from the point of view of computational complexity\ntheory (cf. Papadimitriou, 1994; Aaronson, 2012), the solution to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem\nprovided by this algorithm is no more efficient than a classical solution: from a complexitytheoretic point of view, a solution S1 to a problem P is deemed to be just as efficient as\na solution S2 so long as S1 requires at most a polynomial increase in the (time or space)\nresources required to solve P as compared with S2 . From this point of view, only an exponential reduction in time or space resources can qualify as a true increase in efficiency. Clearly,\nthe mixed-state Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm does not yield a speedup over classical solutions,\nin this sense, when \u03b5 is small. In fact it can be shown (Vedral, 2010, 1148) that exponential\nspeedup, and hence a true increase in efficiency from a complexity-theoretic point of view,\nis achievable only when \u03b5 is large enough for the state to qualify as an entangled state.\nOn the other hand, there is a very real difference, in terms of the amount of information gained, between one invocation of the black box (4.1) and a single classical function\ncall-which is all the more striking since the amount of information one can gain from a single classical function call is actually zero. Further, one should not lose sight of the fact that\nthe complexity-theoretic characterisation of efficient algorithms is artificial and, in a certain\nsense, arbitrary. For instance, on the complexity-theoretic characterisation of computational\nefficiency, a problem, which for input size n, requires \u2248 n1000 steps to solve is polynomial\nin terms of time resources in n and thus tractable, while a problem that requires \u2248 2n/1000\nsteps to solve is exponential in terms of time resources in n and therefore considered to be\nintractable. In this case, however, the 'intractable' problem will typically require much less\ntime to compute than the 'tractable' problem, for all but very large n.22 Such extraordinary\nexamples aside, for most practical purposes the complexity-theoretic characterisation of efficiency is a good one. Nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that this is a practical\ndefinition of efficiency which does not reflect any deep mathematical truth or make any deep\nontological claim about what is and is not efficient in the common or pre-theoretic sense of\nthat term.\nBut let us come back now from this slight digression to our main discussion, and let us\nconsider the question of whether entanglement plays a role in the speedup exhibited by this\nmixed state. The strongest argument in favour of a negative answer to this question is, I\nbelieve, the following. Recall that what I have called the 'most natural' state preparation\nprocedure associated with (4.1) is only one of many possible ways to prepare the system\nrepresented by \u03c1. It is possible to prepare the system in an alternate way if we so desire.\nLikewise, when \u03b5 is sufficiently small, it is possible to prepare the final state of the computer,\n\u03c1f in , as a mixture of product states. This, in fact, is the significance of asserting that \u03c1f in is\nunentangled. Thus while the state preparation most naturally suggested by (4.1) may well\nfunction as a conceptual tool for finding mixed quantum states that display a computational\nadvantage (i.e., by enabling a facile derivation of the identities (4.2-4.5)), once found, it\nseems as though we may do away with this way of thinking of the system entirely. Hence\nthere seems to be no need to invoke entanglement in order to explain the speedup obtainable\nwith this state.\nI believe this line of reasoning to be misleading, however, for it emphasises the abstract\n22\n\nFor example, for n = 1, 000, 000, the easy problem requires (106 )1000 = 106000 steps to complete while\nthe hard problem requires 21000 steps.\n\n12\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\ndensity operator representation of the computational state at the cost of obscuring the nature of the computational process that is actually occurring in the computer. To the point:\nthe density operator corresponding to a quantum system should not be understood as a\nrepresentation of the actual physical state of the system. Rather, the density operator representation of a quantum system should be understood as a representation of our knowledge\nof the space of physical states that the system can possibly be in, and of our ignorance as\nto which of these physical states the system is actually in.\nFrom the point of view of quantum mechanics, it is pure states of quantum systems\nwhich should be seen as representations of the 'actual' physical states of such systems,\nfor pure states represent the most specific description of a system that is possible from\nwithin the theory. I have enclosed the word actual within inverted commas in the preceding\nsentence in order to emphasise the weakness of the claim I am making. This claim is\nnot intended to rule out that there may be a deeper physical theory underlying quantum\nmechanics, within which quantum mechanical pure states can be seen as merely derivative\nrepresentations. Nor is it intended to rule out that quantum mechanics only incompletely\n(as a matter of principle) specifies the nature of the physical world. I am only making what\nshould be the uncontroversial claim that relative to quantum mechanics itself, pure states\nshould be interpreted as those which are most fundamental, in the sense that they represent\na maximally specific description, within the theory, of the systems in question-i.e., they\nrepresent the best grasp available, from within that theory, of the real physical situation.\nPhysics is the science of what is real, in the very minimal sense that physical concepts\npurport to give us some idea of what the world is like. And if pure states represent the best\npossible, i.e., the most specific, representation of the physical situation from the point of\nview of a theory, then with right should they be treated as the more fundamental concepts\nof the theory. Mixed states, on the other hand, should be seen as derivative in the sense that\nthey are abstract characterisations of our knowledge of the space of pure states a system\nmay be possibly in,23 and of our ignorance of precisely which state within this space the\nsystem is actually in.\nIf the reader accepts this difference in fundamental status that I have accorded to pure\nand mixed quantum states,24 then she should agree that if it is an explanation of the physical process actually occurring in the computer that we desire, then it will not do to limit\nourselves to analysing the characteristics of the computer's 'black box' mixed state; rather,\n23\n\nIf one prefers, one can think of a mixed state as a statistical state, representing the mean values of a\nhypothetical ensemble of systems. The difference is inessential to this discussion.\n24\nMy claim is intended to be weak enough to be compatible with interpretations of the quantum state\nsuch as Spekkens's, in which quantum states are analogous to the state descriptions of his toy theory (cf.\nSpekkens 2007), in that they represent maximal, though in principle incomplete, knowledge of the system in\nquestion. It is also intended to be compatible with Fuchs's statement that \"... the quantum state represents a\ncollection of subjective degrees of belief about something to do with that system ...\" (Fuchs, 2003, 989-990).\nNevertheless, the compatibility of my claim with Fuchs's and Spekkens's views may be doubted by some. This\nis not the place to attempt to give a reading of either Fuchs's or Spekkens's opinions on the interpretation of\nthe quantum state description, however. While I may be incorrect as regards the compatibility of my claim\nwith their views, I hope that most readers will, regardless, appreciate the benign nature of and be agreeable\nto the claim that I am making here. In any case I will be assuming it in the remainder of this paper. (For\na more in-depth treatment of Fuchs's and Spekkens's interpretation of the quantum state description, see:\nTait 2012.)\n\n13\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nwe should attempt to give a more detailed 'white box' characterisation of the operation of\nthe computer in terms of its underlying pure states. Recall the fact-which we noted in\nour earlier discussion of de-quantisation-that the unitary evolution (3.2) is, in general, an\nentangling evolution; i.e., it will take pure product states, such as, for instance, |0n i|1i, to\nentangled states. Now imagine that the computer is initially prepared in the most natural way suggested by the pseudo-pure state representation (4.1). Call this 'most natural'\nstate preparation: sini . Imagine further that the computer evolves in accordance with the\nentangling unitary transformation Uf . This will yield the transformation\nUf\n\n|0n i|1i \u2212\u2192 |\u03c6i\nwith probability \u03b5, and the transformation\nUf\n\nI \u2212\u2192 I\nwith probability 1 \u2212 \u03b5, where |\u03c6i is an entangled state. Thus at the end of the computation,\nthe system will be in the state |\u03c6i with probability \u03b5 and in the state I with probability\n1 \u2212 \u03b5. Call this combination of possible states for the system sf in . Now at the end of the\ncomputation, the state of the computer will be expressible by means of the density operator\n\u03c1f in = \u03b5|\u03c6ih\u03c6| + (1 \u2212 \u03b5)I .\nThe most natural way that suggests itself for preparing the system represented by \u03c1f in is\nsf in . However, one may instead imagine a state preparation procedure s\u2032f in involving only\nproduct states that would result in an equivalent density operator representation. Because of\nthis, it is concluded by some that entanglement plays no role in the computational advantage\nexhibited by the computer in this case.\nThe significance of the fact that Uf is an entangling evolution, however, is that sini ,\nevolved in accordance with Uf , will not result in the combination of states s\u2032f in -rather, it\nwill result in the combination of states sf in . Since both state preparations, sf in and s\u2032f in ,\nyield the same density matrix representation, they are, from this point of view, equivalent,\nbut one cannot directly obtain s\u2032f in from an application of Uf to sini .25\nWhat of the fact, however, that \u03b5 in the state preparation sf in may be vanishingly small\nin principle and yet still lead to a computational advantage-does not this tell against\nattributing the speedup exhibited by the computer to entanglement? I do not believe it\ndoes. One must not lose sight of the fact that \"vanishingly small\" 6= 0. If \u03b5 were actually\nequal to zero, it is evident that there would, in fact, be no performance advantage.\nIt is interesting, nevertheless, to consider the question of what can happen in the quantum\ncomputer when \u03b5 = 0; i.e., when the state of the computer initially just is the totally mixed\n25\n\nI am indebted to Wayne Myrvold for suggesting this line of thought, and for helping to clear up the\nconceptual confusions regarding this issue that have plagued me to date. I am also indebted to the discussion\nin Jozsa & Linden (2003, \u00a75). I should note, also, that Long et al. (2002) make a similar point to the one\nmade here; but in making it they unnecessarily rely on interpreting the density matrix of a system as\nrepresenting the average values of a physical ensemble (i.e. of an actual collection of physical systems). The\nobjection is equally forceful, however, whether one thinks of the mixed state as representing a physical or a\nstatistical ensemble, and whether one thinks of the probabilities as ignorance probabilities or as representing\nrelative frequencies.\n\n14\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nstate I . Note that this does not signify that it is impossible for the computer to actually\nhave been prepared in the pure state |0n i|1i initially. Rather, it represents the circumstance\nwhere we are completely ignorant of the initial state preparation of the quantum computer;\nfor instance, if the computer has been prepared as an equally weighted mixture of the basis\nstates:\nn\n\n\u03c1ini\n\n2 \u22121\n1 X\n=I = n\n|xihx|.\n2 x=0\n\n(4.6)\n\nSuppose then, that the quantum computer, represented by the density operator \u03c1ini = I ,\nactually is in |0n i|1i at the start of the computation. Is a computational process occurring\nwhich would enable quantum speedup? From one point of view, the answer is yes, for the\nentangling unitary evolution Uf evolves the computer to an entangled state which is then\ncapable of being utilised in principle in order to solve the problem under consideration with\nfewer computational resources than a classical computer. In fact, it is not even necessary for\nthe computer to actually be in the state |0n i|1i initially to enable a performance advantage.\nAs long as we know, or at least are not completely ignorant of, the actual initial pure state\nof the computer, any of the basis states can, with suitable manipulation, be used to obtain\na performance advantage.\nFrom another point of view, however, the answer is no, for because we are completely\nignorant as to the actual initial state of the computer, we will be completely ignorant as\nto which operation to perform in order to take advantage of this resource. This sounds\nparadoxical, but I think it rather illustrates an important distinction: between what is\nactually occurring in a physical system, on the one hand, and the use which can be made\nof it by us, who are attempting to achieve some particular end. In the example we are\nconsidering here there assuredly is a process occurring in the computer that is of the right\nsort to enable a quantum speedup, but because we are completely ignorant of the computer's\ninitial state-i.e., because there is too much 'noise' in the computer-we are unable to\ntake advantage of it to achieve the end of solving the Deutsch-Jozsa problem using fewer\ncomputational resources than a classical computer.\n\n4.3\n\nDQC1: The power of one qubit\n\nIn the last subsection we saw that it is possible to achieve a sub-exponential speedup for\nthe Deutsch-Jozsa problem with an unentangled mixed-state. We concluded that while this\ndoes disprove the NEST, it does not constitute a counter-example to the NEXT, since the\ncomputational algorithm in question is successful only when the evolution of the state of the\ncomputer is an entangling evolution; therefore the underlying final state of the computer will\nalways contain some entanglement despite the fact that the density operator representation\nof the final state will be unentangled.\nWe now consider another purported counter-example to the NEXT. This is the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1) model of quantum computation, which\nutilises a mixed quantum state to compute the trace of a given unitary operator and displays\nan exponential speedup over known classical solutions. As we will see, the claim sometimes\nmade to the effect that the DQC1 achieves this speedup without the use of entanglement is\n15\n\n\fMichael E.

The NEXT, however, is not the claim that any state that displays quantum\ncomputational speedup must be entangled. That is the NEST. The NEXT is, rather, the\ndifferent claim that entanglement must play a role in any physical explanation of quantum\nspeedup. We saw in the last section how it is possible for the NEST to be false26 and the\nNEXT to be true. In this section I will address the objection that the NEXT is false even if\nit is the case that the state of the quantum computer is always entangled. Those defending\nsuch a view claim that another measure of quantum correlations, quantum discord, is far\nbetter suited for the explanatory role. In what follows I will argue that this conclusion is\nmisguided. Quantum discord is indeed an enormously useful theoretical quantity for characterising mixed-state quantum computation-perhaps even more useful than entanglement.\nNevertheless, more than just pragmatic considerations must be appealed to if one is to make\nthe case that a particular feature of quantum systems explains quantum speedup. Thus I will\nargue that when one looks deeper, and considers the quantum state from the multi-partite\npoint of view, one finds that entanglement is involved in the production, and even in the very\ndefinition, of quantum discord; indeed, there are some preliminary indications that quantum\ndiscord is, in fact, but a manifestation of and not conceptually distinct from entanglement.\nIn the DQC1, or as it is sometimes called: 'the power of one qubit', model of quantum\ncomputation (cf. Knill & Laflamme, 1998),27 a collection of n 'unpolarised' qubits in the\ncompletely mixed state In /2n is coupled to a single 'polarised' control qubit, initialised to\n1/2(I + \u03b1Z). When the polarisation, \u03b1, is equal to 1, the control qubit is in the pure state\n|0ih0| = 1/2(I + Z), otherwise it is in a mixed state. The problem is to compute the trace\nof an arbitrary n-qubit unitary operator, Tr(Un ). To accomplish this, we begin by applying\na Hadamard gate to the control qubit,28 which is then forwarded as part of the input to a\ncontrolled unitary gate that acts on the n unpolarised qubits (see Figure 1). This results in\nthe following state for all of the n + 1 qubits:\n1\n\n|0ih0| \u2297 In + |1ih1| \u2297 In + \u03b1|0ih1| \u2297 Un\u2020 + \u03b1|1ih0| \u2297 Un\n2n+1 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\nIn \u03b1Un\u2020\n.\n= n+1\n\u03b1Un In\n2\n\n\u03c1n+1 =\n\n26\n27\n28\n\n\u0001\n\n(4.7)\n\nI mean false in the technical sense explained in \u00a72.2.\nIn this exposition of the DQC1, I am closely following (Datta et al., 2005).\nH\n\nThis will yield, for instance, when the control qubit is pure, |0ih0| \u2212\u2192\n\n16\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n|0ih0| + |0ih1| + |1ih0| + |1ih1| .\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nThe reduced state of the control qubit is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b1Tr(Un )\u2020\n,\n\u03c1c =\n\u03b1Tr(Un )\n1\nthus the trace of Un can be retrieved by applying the X and Y Pauli operators to \u03c1c . In\nparticular, the expectation values of the X and Y operators will yield the real and imaginary\nparts of the trace, hXi = Re[Tr(Un )]/2n and hY i = \u2212Im[Tr(Un )]/2n , respectively; so in order\nto determine, for instance, the real part, we run the circuit repeatedly, measuring X on the\ncontrol qubit at the end of each run, while assuming that the results are part of a distribution\nwhose mean is the real part of the trace.\nClassically, the problem of evaluating the trace of a unitary matrix is believed to be hard,\nhowever for the quantum algorithm it can be shown that the number of runs required does\nnot scale exponentially with n, yielding an exponential advantage for the DQC1 quantum\ncomputer. When \u03b1 < 1, the expectation values, hXi and hY i, are reduced by a factor of\n\u03b1 and it becomes correspondingly more difficult to estimate the trace. However as long as\nthe control qubit has non-zero polarisation, the model still provides an efficient method for\nestimating the trace (and thus an exponential speedup over any known classical solution) in\nspite of this additional overhead.\nWe might ask whether, in a way analogous to the mixed-state Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm,\nwe can make \u03b1 small enough so that the overall state of the DQC1 is demonstrably separable.\nThe answer seems to be no. On the one hand, for any system of n + 1 qubits there is a ball\nof radius r (measured by the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and centred at the completely mixed\nstate), within which all states are separable (Braunstein et al., 1999; Gurvits & Barnum,\n2003). On the other hand, the state of the DQC1 is at all times at a fixed distance \u03b12\u2212(n+1)/2\nfrom the completely mixed state. Unfortunately the radius of the separable ball decreases\nexponentially faster than 2\u2212(n+1)/2 (Datta et al., 2005, 2).\nThus, as (Datta et al., 2005, 2) assert, there appears to be good reason to suspect that\nthe state (4.7) is an entangled state, at least for some Un ; but it is not obvious where\nthis entanglement is. On the one hand, there is no bipartite entanglement among the n\nunpolarised qubits. On the other hand the most natural bipartite split of the system, with the\ncontrol qubit playing the role of the first subsystem and the remaining qubits playing the role\nof the second, reveals no entanglement between the two subsystems, regardless of the choice\nof Un . When \u03b1 > 1/2, entanglement can be found when we examine other bipartite divisions\namongst the n+1 qubits (see Figure 2), however, besides being exceedingly difficult to detect,\nthe amount of entanglement in the state (as measured by the multiplicative negativity;\ncf. Plenio & Virmani 2007) becomes vanishingly small as n gets large. Commenting on\nthis circumstance, Datta et al. (2005, 13) write \"This hints that the key to computational\nspeedup might be the global character of the entanglement, rather than the amount of the\nentanglement. ... what happier motto can we find for this state of affairs than Multam ex\nParvo, or A Lot out of A Little.\"\nOthers have expressed a different viewpoint on the matter. In fact, both the DQC1 and\nthe mixed-state version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm have led many (see for instance,\nVedral 2010) to seriously question whether entanglement plays a necessary role in the explanation of quantum speedup. The result has been a shift in investigative focus from\n17\n\n\fMichael E.

No entanglement can ever occur\namongst the n unpolarised qubits (a) or between the polarised qubit and the rest (b); however, bipartite\nsplits such as (c), (d), and (e) can exhibit entanglement (Datta et al., 2005).\n\nentanglement to other types of quantum correlations. One alternative in particular, quantum discord (which I will explain in more detail shortly), has received much attention in the\nliterature in recent years (see, e.g., Merali, 2011).\nOn the one hand, the following facts all seem to run counter to the NEXT: there is\nno entanglement in the DQC1 circuit between the polarised and unpolarised qubits-the\nmost natural bipartite split that suggests itself-during a computation; tests to detect entanglement along other bipartite splits in the DQC1 when \u03b1 \u2264 1/2 have thus far been\nunsuccessful;29 and finally, even when \u03b1 is relatively large, only a vanishingly small amount\nof entanglement can be found in the state of the DQC1 (4.7). On the other hand, when\nwe consider the correlations between the polarised and unpolarised qubits from the point\nof view of quantum discord, it turns out that the discord at the end of the computation is\nalways non-zero along this bipartite split for any \u03b1 > 0 (Datta et al., 2008). Datta et al.\n(2008, 4) therefore write, and I agree, that \"for some purposes, quantum discord might be\na better figure of merit for characterizing the quantum resources available to a quantum\ninformation processor.\" All the same, as I will argue below, it is a mistake to conclude as\nthey and others do that the NEXT is false; i.e., that entanglement may play no role in the\nexplanation of the quantum speedup of the DQC1 (Datta et al., 2008; Vedral, 2010; Merali,\n2011); for the NEXT is compatible with all of these facts.\n29\n\nThe criterion used by Datta et al. (2005) to detect entanglement is the Peres-Horodecki, or Positive\nPartial Transpose\n(PPT) criterion (Peres, 1996; Horodecki et al., 1996). The partial transpose of a bipartite\nP\n|iihj|\n\u2297 |kihl| acting on HA \u2297 HB is defined (with respect to the system B) as:\nsystem, ijkl pij\nkl\n\u03c1TB \u2261 (I \u2297 T )\u03c1 =\n\nX\nijkl\n\nT\npij\nkl |iihj| \u2297 (|kihl|) =\n\nX\nijkl\n\npij\nkl |iihj| \u2297 |lihk|,\n\nwhere T is the transpose map on matrices. The PPT criterion states that, if \u03c1 is a separable state, then\nthe partial transpose of \u03c1 has non-negative eigenvalues. Satisfying the PPT criterion is a necessary (but\nnot sufficient) condition for the joint density matrix of two systems to be separable. While Datta et al.\nwere unable to detect entanglement in the DQC1 (along any bipartite split) for the case of \u03b1 \u2264 1/2, they\nnevertheless note that it is very likely that both entanglement and bound entanglement are present in the\nstate. A state exhibits bound entanglement (cf. Hyllus et al., 2004) when, in spite of the fact that it is\nentangled, no pure entangled state can be obtained from it by means of LOCC operations. One important\ncharacteristic of bound entangled states is that they (at least sometimes) satisfy the PPT criterion despite\nthe fact that they are entangled.\n\n18\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\n4.4\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nQuantum discord\n\nQuantum discord (Henderson & Vedral, 2001; Ollivier & Zurek, 2002)30 quantifies the difference between the quantum generalisations of two classically equivalent measures of mutual\ninformation,31\nIc (A : B) = H(A) + H(B) \u2212 H(A, B),\nJc (A : B) = H(A) \u2212 H(A|B).\n\n(4.8)\n(4.9)\n\nThese two expressions are not equivalent quantum mechanically, for while (4.8) has a straightforward quantum generalisation in terms of the von Neumann entropy S:\nIq (A : B) = S(A) + S(B) \u2212 S(A, B),\n\n(4.10)\n\nthings are more complicated for the quantum generalisation of (4.9). The quantum counterpart, S(A|B), to the conditional entropy requires a specification of the information content\nof A given a determination of the state of B. Determining the state of B requires a measurement, however, which requires the choice of an observable. But in quantum mechanics\nobservables are, in general, non-commuting. Thus the conditional entropy will be different\ndepending on the observable we choose to measure on B. If, for simplicity, we consider only\nperfect measurements, represented by a set of one dimensional projection operators, {\u03a0B\nj },\nthis yields, for the quantum version of (4.9), the expression:\nJq (A : B) = S(A) \u2212 S(A|{\u03a0B\nj }).\n\n(4.11)\n\nWe now define discord as the minimum value (taken over {\u03a0B\nj }) of the difference between\n(4.10) and (4.11):\nD(A, B) \u2261 min{\u03a0Bj } Iq (A : B) \u2212 Jq (A : B).\n\n(4.12)\n\nDiscord is, in general, non-zero for mixed states, while for pure states it effectively becomes\na measure of entanglement (Datta et al., 2008, 3); i.e., for pure states it is equivalent to the\nentropy of entanglement (cf. Plenio & Virmani, 2007).\nInterestingly, there are some mixed states which, though separable, exhibit non-zero quantum discord. For instance, consider the following bipartite state:\n1\n1\n\u03c1disc = (|0ih0|A \u2297 |0ih0|B ) + (|1ih1|A \u2297 |+ih+|B ).\n2\n2\n\n(4.13)\n\nThis state is obviously separable. Since |0i and |+i are non-orthogonal states, however,\nJq (A : B) will yield a different value depending on the experiment performed on system B;\nand thus this state will yield a non-zero quantum discord. Note that this is impossible for a\n30\n\nQuantum discord was introduced independently by both Henderson & Vedral and by Ollivier & Zurek,\nwith slight differences in their respective formulations (Henderson & Vedral consider not just projective measurements but positive operator valued measures more generally). These and other alternative formulations\nof quantum discord do not differ in essentials. The definition of discord I introduce here is Ollivier & Zurek's.\n31\nSee Nielsen & Chuang (2000) for an overview of the basic concepts of classical and quantum information\ntheory.\n\n19\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nclassical state: classically, it is always possible to prepare a state as a mixture of orthogonal\nproduct states.\nIn most of the literature on this topic, one is introduced to quantum discord as a quantifier\nof the non-classical correlations present in a state which are not necessarily identifiable with\nentanglement. Such an interpretation of the significance of this quantity is supported by the\nfact that, in the classical scenario at least, the mutual information contained in a system of\ntwo random variables is held to be representative of the extent of the correlations between\nthem. Since the quantum generalisations of the two classically equivalent measures of mutual\ninformation Ic (A : B) and Jc (A : B) are not equivalent, then, this is taken to represent the\npresence of non-classical correlations over and above the classical ones, some, but not all of\nwhich may be accounted for by entanglement, and some by 'quantum discord'.\nInterpreting discord as a type of non-classical correlation is nevertheless puzzling. Consider, for instance, a classically correlated state represented by the following probability\ndistribution:\n1\n1\n([+]l , [+]r ) + [\u2212]l [\u2212]r .\n(4.14)\n2\n2\nHere, let [*]l represent the circumstance that Linda (in Liverpool) finds a letter in her mailbox\ntoday containing a piece of paper on which is inscribed the specified symbol (+ or \u2212), and let\n[*]r represent the occurrence of a similar circumstance for Robert (in Ravenna). According\nto the probability distribution, it is equally likely that they both receive a letter today\ninscribed with + as it is that they both receive one inscribed with \u2212, but it cannot happen\nthat they each today receive letters with non-matching symbols. These correlations are\neasily explainable classically, of course. It so happens that yesterday I flipped a fair coin.\nI observed the result of the toss and accordingly jotted down either + or \u2212 on a piece of\npaper, photocopied it, and sent one copy each to Robert in Ravenna and Linda in Liverpool\n(by overnight courier, of course).\nA quantum analogue for classically correlated states such as (4.14) is a mixed state\ndecomposable into product states:\nX\npij |iihi| \u2297 |jihj|\n(4.15)\nij\n\nsuch that the |ii and |ji are mutually orthogonal sub-states of the first and second subsystem,\nrespectively. For such a state it is easy to provide a 'hidden variables' explanation, similar\nto the one above, that will account for the observed probabilities of joint experiments on the\ntwo subsystems.\nWe can equally give such a local hidden variables account of the discordant state \u03c1disc :\ntossing a fair coin, I prepare the state |0ih0|A \u2297 |0ih0|B if the coin lands heads, and |1ih1|A \u2297\n|+ih+|B if it lands tails. Let P r(X, Y |a, b, \u03bb) refer to the probability that Alice's a-experiment\nand Bob's b-experiment determine their qubits to be in states X and Y , respectively, given\nthat the result of the coin toss is \u03bb. Then (omitting bras and kets for readability):\nP r(0, 0|\u1e91, \u1e91, H) = P r(0, *|\u1e91, *, H) \u00d7 P r(*, 0|*, \u1e91, H) = 1,\nP r(1, 1|\u1e91, \u1e91, T ) = P r(1, *|\u1e91, *, T ) \u00d7 P r(*, 1|*, \u1e91, T ) = 1/2,\nP r(0, +|\u1e91, x\u0302, H) = P r(0, *|\u1e91, *, H) \u00d7 P r(*, +|*, x\u0302, H) = 1/2,\nP r(1, +|\u1e91, x\u0302, T ) = P r(1, *|\u1e91, *, T ) \u00d7 P r(*, +|*, x\u0302, T ) = 1,\n20\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nand so on. More generally, P r(X, Y |a, b, \u03bb) = P r(X, *|a, *, \u03bb) \u00d7 P r(*, Y |*, b, \u03bb). Thus once we\nspecify the value of \u03bb there are no remaining correlations in the system and the probabilities\nfor joint experiments are factorisable. This should be unsurprising. Given a specification of\n\u03bb, the state of the system is in a product state, after all.\nContrast this with an entangled quantum system such as, for instance, the one represented\nby the pure state\n|00i + |11i\n\u221a\n.\n|\u03a6+ i =\n2\nBell's theorem (Bell, 2004 [1964]) demonstrates that the correlations between subsystems\npresent in such a state cannot be reproduced by any local hidden variables theory in the\nmanner described above. These correlations are non-classical.\nThere is certainly something non-classical about a state such as \u03c1disc ; viz., a quantum state\nsuch as \u03c1disc , though separable, cannot be prepared as a mixture of orthogonal product states.\nYet it is always possible to so prepare classical states. As a result, the information one can\ngain about Alice's system through an experiment in the {+, \u2212} basis on Bob's system will be\ndifferent from the information one can gain about Alice's system through an experiment in\nthe computational basis on Bob's system. On the one hand, in the absence of a specification\nof a hidden parameter such as \u03bb, given an experiment on B in the computational basis which\ndetermines B to be in state |0i, it is still unclear, because of the way in which system B was\nprepared, whether the joint system is in the state |0i \u2297 |0i or in the state |1i \u2297 |+i. Given\nan experiment on B in the {+, \u2212} basis which yields |+i, on the other hand, it is perfectly\nclear which product state the joint system is in. But these facts by themselves are certainly\nnot indicative of the presence of non-classical correlations between the two subsystems.\nThere is one indirect sense, however, in which \u03c1disc can be said to contain non-classical\ncorrelations. Recall from \u00a72.4 that any mixture can be considered as the result of taking the\npartial trace of a pure entangled state on a larger Hilbert space. Given that, as I argued in\n\u00a74.2, the pure state representation of a quantum system should be taken as fundamental, we\ncan consider the bipartite state \u03c1disc as in reality but a partial representation of a tripartite\nentangled quantum system, where the third party is an external environment with enough\ndegrees of freedom to purify the overall system. And since entangled systems do not admit of a description in terms of local hidden variables, it follows that the system partially\nrepresented by \u03c1disc can legitimately be said to contain non-classical correlations.\nEven so it is unclear how these non-classical correlations per se can have anything to do\nwith the quantum discord exhibited by \u03c1disc , for it is also the case that a classically correlated\nmixture of orthogonal product states, i.e. one of the form (4.15), can be purified in just the\nsame way as a discordant one and hence also the case that it can be given a multi-partite\nrepresentation in which entanglement is present.\nAs we will now see, however, there is in fact a tight relationship between the amount of\ndiscord associated with a bipartite mixed state and the amount of entanglement associated\nwith a tripartite representation of that state. And, interestingly from our point of view,\nwhat emerges from this is a correspondingly tight relationship between the quantum speedup\nexhibited by the DQC1 and the amount of entanglement associated with its purified tripartite\nrepresentation, and thus a confirmation, not a refutation, of the NEXT.\n\n21\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\n4.5\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nExplaining speedup in the DQC1\n\nQuantum discord was introduced independently by Henderson & Vedral and by Ollivier & Zurek\nin 2001 and 2002, respectively; however, it was only recently given an operational interpretation, independently by Madhok & Datta (2011) and by Cavalcanti et al. (2011).32 On both\ncharacterisations, quantum discord is operationally defined in terms of the entanglement consumed in an extended version of the quantum state merging protocol (cf. Horodecki et al.,\n2005).\nIn the quantum state merging protocol, three parties: Alice, Bob, and Cassandra, share\na state |\u03c8ABC i. Quantum state merging characterises the process,\n|\u03c8ABC i \u2192 |\u03c8B\u2032 BC i,\nby which Alice effectively transfers her part of the system to Bob while maintaining its coherence with Cassandra's part. It turns out that in order to effect this protocol a certain\namount of entanglement must be consumed (quantified on the basis of the quantum conditional entropy, S(A|B); cf. Nielsen & Chuang 2000.). When we add to this the amount of\nentanglement needed (as quantified by the entanglement of formation; cf. Plenio & Virmani\n2007) to prepare the state |\u03c8ABC i to begin with, the result is a quantity identical to the\nquantum discord between the subsystems belonging to Alice and Cassandra at the time the\nstate is prepared.\nThe foregoing operational interpretation of discord has an affinity with an illuminating\nanalysis of the DQC1 circuit due to Fanchini et al. (2011). Fanchini et al. show that a relationship between quantum discord and entanglement emerges when we consider the DQC1\ncircuit, not as a bipartite system composed of polarised and unpolarised qubits respectively,\nbut as a tripartite system in which the environment plays the role of the third subsystem.\nFanchini et al. note that an alternate way of characterising the completely mixed state of\nthe unpolarised qubits, In /2n , is to view it as part of a bipartite entangled state, with the\nsecond party an external environment having enough degrees of freedom to purify the overall\nsystem. This yields a tripartite representation for the DQC1 circuit as a whole (see Figure\n3).\nFanchini et al. show that, for an arbitrary tripartite pure state, there is a conservation\nrelation between entanglement of formation and quantum discord. In particular, the sum\nof the bipartite entanglement that is shared between a particular subsystem and the other\nsubsystems of the system cannot be increased without increasing the sum of the quantum\ndiscord between this subsystem and the other subsystems as well (and vice versa). In the\nDQC1, after the application of the controlled not gate (see Figure 1), there is an increase in\nthe quantum discord between B and A. This therefore necessarily involves a corresponding\nincrease in the entanglement between A and the combined system BE. All of this accords\nwith what we would expect given the above operational interpretation of quantum discord:\nan increase in quantum discord requires an increase in the entanglement available for consumption in a potential quantum state merging process.\nNote also that from this tripartite point of view, there is just as much entanglement\n32\n\nI present here the definition given by Cavalcanti et al., although the conclusion I will draw is the same\nregardless of which definition is used.\n\n22\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\n(a)\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: A (pure) tripartite representation of the elements of the DQC1 protocol before (a) and after (b)\nthe application of the controlled not gate. Black and grey thunderbolts represent entanglement and discord,\nrespectively. After the application of the controlled not gate, there is an increase in the discord between A\nand B and a corresponding increase in the entanglement between A and the combined system BE.\n\nin the circuit as there is discord; in particular, exactly as for quantum discord, there is\nentanglement in the circuit whenever it displays a quantum speedup, i.e., for any \u03b1 > 0.\nFanchini et al. speculate that it is not the presence of entanglement or discord (however\nthe latter is interpreted) per se that is necessary for the quantum speedup of the DQC1,\nbut rather the ability of the circuit to redistribute entanglement and discord. This thought\nseems to be confirmed by a theoretical result of Brodutch & Terno (2011), who show that\nshared entanglement is required in order for two parties to bilocally implement33 any bipartite quantum gate-even one that operates on a restricted set L of unentangled input\nstates and transforms them into unentangled output states. This means, in particular, that\nentanglement is required in order to implement a gate that changes the discord of a quantum\nstate.\nBy themselves, these considerations already amount to confirmations of the NEXT, for\nentanglement appears to be involved in the very definition of discord, and it appears that\nwe require entanglement even for the production of discord in a quantum circuit. But in\naddition, there are indications that quantum discord need not be appealed to at all to give an\naccount of quantum speedup (though such a characterisation will of course be less practical,\nas I have already mentioned), in light of one other recent theoretical result. Devi et al. (2008;\n2011) have pointed out that more general measurement schemes than the positive operator\nvalued measures (POVM) used thus far exist for characterising the correlations present in\nbipartite quantum systems.\nPOVMs are associated with completely positive maps and are well suited for describing\nthe evolution of a system when we can view the system as uncorrelated with its external\nenvironment. When the system is initially correlated with the environment, however, the\nreduced dynamics of the system may, according to Devi et al., be 'not completely positive'.\nBut as Devi et al. show, from the point of view of a measurement scheme that incorporates not completely positive maps in addition to completely positive maps, all quantum\ncorrelations reduce to entanglement.\nIn sum, it is, I believe, unsurprising that on the standard analysis the DQC1 circuit\ndisplays strange and anomalous correlations in the form of quantum discord, for the DQC1\nis typically characterised as a bipartite system, and from the point of view of a measurement\nframework that incorporates only completely positive maps. As Fanchini et al. have shown,\nhowever, the DQC1 circuit is more properly characterised, not as an isolated system, but\nas a system initially correlated with an external environment. The evolution of such a\n33\n\nBilocal implementation means, in this context, an implementation in which Alice and Bob are limited\nto local operations and classical communications (cf. Plenio & Virmani, 2007).\n\n23\n\n\fMichael E. Cuffaro\n\nOn the Necessity of Entanglement\n\nsystem is best captured by a measurement framework incorporating not completely positive\nmaps, and within such a framework, the anomalous correlations disappear and are subsumed\nunder entanglement. From this point of view the equivalence of entanglement and discord\nfor pure bipartite states is also unsurprising, for it is precisely pure states for which the\ncorrelation with the environment can be ignored and for which a framework incorporating\nonly completely positive maps is appropriate.\nThe use of not completely positive maps to characterise the evolution of open quantum\nsystems is not wholly without its detractors. The question of whether such not completely\npositive maps are 'unphysical' is an interesting and important one, though I will not address\nit here.34 But regardless of the answer to this question, it should be clear, even without\nthe appeal to this more general framework, that entanglement has not been shown to be\nunnecessary for quantum computational speedup. Far from being a counter-example to the\nNEXT, the DQC1 model of quantum computation rather serves to illuminate the crucial\nrole that entanglement plays in the quantum speedup displayed by this computer.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nQuantum entanglement is considered by many to be a necessary resource that is used to\nadvantage by a quantum computer in order to achieve a speedup over classical computation.\nGiven Jozsa & Linden's and Abbott's general results for pure states, and given that, as I\nargued in \u00a74.2, a pure state should be considered as the most fundamental representation\nof a quantum system possible in quantum mechanics, the burden is upon those who deny\nthe NEXT to either produce a counter-example or to show, in some other more principled\nway, why the view is false. We examined two such counter-examples in this paper. Upon\ncloser examination we found neither of these, neither the sub-exponential speedup of the unentangled mixed-state version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, nor the exponential speedup\nof the DQC1 model of quantum computation, demonstrate that entanglement is unnecessary for quantum speedup; they rather make clearer than before the role that entanglement\ndoes play, and point the way to a fuller understanding of both entanglement and quantum\ncomputation.\n\nReferences\nAaronson, S.
