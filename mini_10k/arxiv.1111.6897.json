At this writing, there\nhave been no hints of supersymmetry, defying expectations based on the sensitivity of the Higgs\npotential to superpartner masses in many models, including the popular \"mSUGRA\" (minimal\nsupergravity) scenario. It is possible that the failure of SUSY to appear is simply due to the up\nand down squarks being very heavy, as their production otherwise gives the strongest bounds.\nAnother possibility is that the superpartners are not so heavy, but are difficult to detect because of\na compressed mass spectrum, leading to much smaller visible energy than in mSUGRA benchmark\ncases. For our purposes here, compressed SUSY refers to the situation in which the mass ratio\nbetween the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and the gluino is significantly smaller than the\nprediction mLSP /mg\u0303 \u223c 1/6 of mSUGRA.\nIn a previous paper [2], we investigated the reach of 2010 data from ATLAS, consisting of 35\n\u221a\n\u22121\npb of collisions at s = 7 TeV, for several classes of compressed SUSY models. In the present\nwork, we will update this analysis to correspond to the 1.04 fb\u22121 data set analyzed by ATLAS in\nref. [3]. Not only does this represent a huge increase in integrated luminosity, but also a revised set\nof signal regions compared to the 2010 data set analyses. The ATLAS analysis presents exclusion\nresults for mSUGRA models, and for simplified models containing only squarks and a gluino but\nwith the LSP mass held fixed at 0. In both cases the models tested are very far from the compressed\ncase in which the mass difference between the gluino and the LSP is smaller. Our aims here are\nto see how the exclusions found for mSUGRA and simplified models translate into exclusions on\ncompressed SUSY, for the various ATLAS signal regions, with particular attention to the exclusions\nthat can be made in the most difficult case of very high compression. Other recent studies that\ninclude compressed SUSY and other non-mSUGRA searches at the LHC in a similar spirit can be\nfound in [4]-[22].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the signal regions and our\nprocedures. Section III describes four classes of models, each of which depends on two parameters,\nthe gluino mass Mg\u0303 and a compression parameter c, which are independently and continuously\ndialed to vary the overall superpartner mass scale and the ratio of gluino to LSP masses. Section\nIV gives results for the acceptances for these models with the various signal regions, and estimated\nexclusions based on the 1.04 fb\u22121 data set. Section V contains some concluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nPROCEDURES AND SIGNAL REQUIREMENTS\n\nFor this paper, we used the same tools as in our earlier work [2]. MadGraph/MadEvent 4.4.62\n[23] was used to generate hard scattering events using CTEQ6L1 [24] parton distribution functions, Pythia 6.422 [25] for decays and showering and hadronization, and PGS 4 [26] for detector\nsimulation. In SUSY models with compressed mass spectra, it is important to correctly generate jets beyond the hard scattering event, by matching correctly (without overcounting) between\nmatrix-element and showering/hadronization software generation of additional jets.

Also shown on the last line are the ATLAS 95% CL bounds on the non-Standard\nModel contribution to the cross-section times acceptance in the five signal regions. (In the case of signal\nregion E only, the meff > 1100 GeV requirement involves a sum over all jets with pT > 40 GeV, but the\nmeff used in the ETmiss /meff cut is a sum over only the leading 4 jets.)\n\nby generating each lowest-order process together with the same process with one additional jet at\nthe matrix-element level, followed by MLM matching with PT -ordered showers with the shower-KT\nscheme with Qcut = 100 GeV, as described in [27] and implemented in the MadGraph/MadEvent\npackage. (It is much more time-consuming to include up to two extra jets at the matrix-element\nlevel. We found with some sample testing that it did not make a significant difference with our\nsetup even for very compressed superpartner mass spectra.) For the detector simulation, we used\nthe default ATLAS-like parameter card file provided with the PGS distribution, but with a jet cone\nsize of \u2206R = 0.4. Cross-sections were normalized to the next-to-leading order output of Prospino\n2.1 [28].\nTo define signals, we follow (a slightly simplified version of) the ATLAS cuts for multijets+ETmiss\nfrom ref. [3]. The signal requirements are summarized in Table I. Events are required to have at\nleast one jet with pT > 130 GeV. The signal regions A, B, C, and D also require at least 2, 3,\n4, and 4 jets with pT > 40 GeV, respectively, while signal region E requires at least 4 jets with\npT > 80 GeV. These jets must have |\u03b7| < 2.5. The leading three jets are required to be isolated\nfrom the missing transverse momentum according to \u2206\u03c6(~\npTmiss , j) > 0.4. The effective mass meff\nis defined as the scalar sum of the ETmiss and the pT 's of: the leading 2 jets for A; the leading 3\njets for B, the leading 4 jets for C, D; and all jets with pT > 40 GeV for E. Then meff is required\nto exceed 1000, 1000, 500, 1000, and 1100 GeV respectively for signal regions A, B, C, D, E. In\naddition, a cut is imposed on the ratio ETmiss /meff of 0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.2 for A, B, C, D,\nE respectively. (For signal region E, only the 4 leading jet pT 's are summed over in the meff used\nin the ETmiss /meff cut, even though the meff cut uses an inclusive sum over jets.) Note that these\ncuts automatically imply a lower limit on ETmiss of 300, 250, 125, 250 GeV for signals A, B, C, D,\nrespectively. For signal region E, a cut ETmiss > 130 GeV is imposed, although on an event-byevent basis this is usually superseded by the ETmiss /meff cut. There is a veto of events with leptons\nl = (e, \u03bc) with |\u03b7| < 2.4 and (2.47) for muons (electrons), and plT > 20 GeV that are farther than\np\n\u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2 > 0.4 from the nearest jet. Also shown on the last line of Table I are the\nATLAS 95% CL limits on non-Standard-Model contributions to the signal regions after acceptance\nand efficiency, as reported in ref. [3]. These will be used below to estimate the reach for compressed\nSUSY models. ATLAS also has searches requiring higher jet multiplicities [29], leptons [30], and\n\n\f4\nb tagging [31], but these searches give significantly less reach for the compressed SUSY models we\nconsider. Comparable searches by CMS have been reported in [32], [33], and [34]; we choose to use\nthe ATLAS results only for reasons of convenience and familiarity.\nBecause our tools for generating SUSY signal events and simulating detector response are not\nthe same as those used by ATLAS, the cross-section and acceptance results found below clearly\ncannot be interpreted in exact correspondence to the ATLAS ones. However, we have checked\nthat the results of our analysis methods correlate well to those in ref. [3] for a sample of mSUGRA\nmodels used there. For mSUGRA models with tan \u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0, m0 = 100 GeV, and m1/2 = 180,\n210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390, 420, 450, and 480 GeV, we found agreement with the ATLAS\nacceptance\u2217efficiency to be typically better than 15%, while for the same parameters but m0 = 660\nGeV, the agreement was usually at the 30% level or better. Keeping these inevitable differences\nin mind, at least an approximate estimate of the true detector response may still be gleaned from\nthe results below, and the general trends should be robust.\n\nIII.\n\nCOMPRESSED SUSY MODELS\n\nIn this section, we define the compressed SUSY models for our study. Following our earlier\nwork ref. [2], let us parameterize the electroweak gaugino masses at the TeV scale in terms of the\ngluino physical mass as\nM1 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 + 5c\n6\n\n\u0013\n\nMg\u0303 ,\n\nM2 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1 + 2c\n3\n\n\u0013\n\nMg\u0303 .\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere c parameterizes the degree of compression. The value c = 0 gives an mSUGRA-like mass\nspectrum with gaugino masses approximately equal at MGUT = 2.5 \u00d7 1016 GeV, and c = 1 gives a\ncompletely compressed spectrum in which the gluino, wino, and bino masses are equal at the TeV\nscale. The gluino mass Mg\u0303 is treated as the independent variable input parameter that sets the\nsuperpartner mass scale. We also select tan \u03b2 = 10 and positive \u03bc = Mg\u0303 + 200 GeV to compute\nthe physical masses of charginos C\u0303i and neutralinos \u00d1i . For our first class of models, we take the\nfirst- and second-family squark masses to be:\nm\u0169R = md \u0303R = m\u0169L = 0.96Mg\u0303 ,\n\nm2d \u0303 = m2\u0169L \u2212 cos(2\u03b2)m2W ,\nL\n\n(3.2)\n\nand sleptons are taken degenerate with the squarks (so too heavy to appear in chargino and\nneutralino two-body decays). The top squark masses are taken to be mt\u03031 = Mg\u0303 \u2212 160 + c(180 \u2212\n0.09Mg\u0303 ) and mt\u03032 = Mg\u0303 + 25, in GeV. The lightest Higgs mass is fixed at mh0 = 115 GeV, and\nthe heavier Higgs masses with mA0 = 0.96Mg\u0303 . These choices provide relatively smoothly varying\nbranching ratios as the compression parameter c is varied, although transitions of \u00d12 and C\u03031 decays\nfrom on-shell to off-shell weak bosons are inevitable as the compression increases. In particular,\nthe reason for the choice for the parameterization of the stop masses is to avoid suddenly turning\non or off any 2-body decay modes as the parameter c is varied within each model line, by making\nsure that the the gluinos cannot decay to stops by kinematics for any of these models.

We refer to the two-parameter class of models spanned by varying (Mg\u0303 , c) as\nmodels I.\nThe masses of the most relevant superpartners are shown in Figure 1 for the case Mg\u0303 = 700\nGeV, illustrating the effect of the compression parameter c on the spectrum. In this class of models,\ngluino and squark production dominate at the LHC. The gluino decays mostly by the two-body\nmode g\u0303 \u2192 qq\u0303 or q q\u0303, and right-handed squarks decay mostly directly to the LSP, q\u0303R \u2192 q \u00d11 , while\nleft-handed squarks decay mostly to wino-like charginos and neutralinos, q\u0303L \u2192 q \u2032 C\u03031 and q \u00d12 .\nThe latter decay through on-shell or off-shell weak bosons: C\u03031 \u2192 W (\u2217) \u00d11 and \u00d12 \u2192 Z (\u2217) \u00d11 ,\nor \u00d12 \u2192 h\u00d11 when it is kinematically allowed. The visible energy in each event from these\ndecays clearly decreases as the compression factor c increases, because of the reduction in available\nkinematic phase space.\nWe define a second class of \"heavy squark\" models, II, which are the same as above but with\nall squarks taken very heavy, MQ\u0303 = Mg\u0303 + 1000 GeV. Thus when c = 0, the model classes I and\nII correspond approximately to mSUGRA with small and large m0 , respectively. In these heavy\nsquark models, the most important production cross-section is from gluino pair production, with\nsubsequent gluino decays g\u0303 \u2192 C\u03031 q q\u0304 \u2032 and \u00d12 q q\u0304 and \u00d11 q q\u0304, with the first two typically dominating.\nThe wino-like states then decay through on-shell or off-shell weak bosons, depending on the mass\ndifference from the compression: C\u03031 \u2192 W (\u2217) \u00d11 and \u00d12 \u2192 Z (\u2217) \u00d11 or h\u00d11 , with the last dominating\nif kinematically allowed.\nOne motivation for compressed SUSY is that taking M3 /M2 much less than the mSUGRA\nprediction can significantly ameliorate [5, 35, 36] the supersymmetric little hierarchy problem.\nThis provides motivation to consider compressed SUSY models in which winos are heavier than the\ngluino. Therefore, we define a third and fourth class of models, III (\"heavy winos\") and IV (\"heavy\nwinos and squarks\"), to be the same as models I and II respectively, but with M2 = Mg\u0303 + 100 GeV\nin each case. In models III, all first- and second-family squarks decay directly to the LSP: q\u0303 \u2192 q \u00d11 ,\nwhile in models IV the squarks decouple from the discovery or best exclusion limit processes. The\n\n\f6\ngluino has direct two-body decays to quarks and squarks as before.\nThe model classes I, II, and III were exactly those we used in ref. [2] in the context of limits\nobtainable with 35 pb\u22121 at LHC, while the model class IV corresponds approximately to the heavy\nsquark limit of the simplified gluino/squark models in [3], but with neutralino LSP masses that\nare here non-zero and vary continuously with c. Thus the models that we discuss here provide a\nquite different slicing through the MSSM parameter space than those found in the experimental\ncollaboration papers. We now proceed to use them to examine how the ATLAS exclusions on\nnon-Standard Model cross-section times acceptance times efficiency impact the parameter space\nfor SUSY with compressed mass spectra.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS OF SIMULATIONS\n\nIn compressed SUSY models, the visible energy in jets is reduced compared to mSUGRA models, leading to a significant reduction in acceptance for signal events. In Figure 2, we show the\nfractional acceptances after all cuts for the models in class I with c = \u22120.1, 0, 0.1, . . . , 0.9 and\nMg\u0303 = 300, 400, . . . , 1300 GeV. Results are shown for each of the signal regions A, B, D, and E. (We\nfind that signal region C is not competitive for setting limits in any of the models we consider, see\nFigure 4 below, so it is not included in Figure 2.)\nFor fixed values of the mass difference Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP , the acceptance tends to approach a limit\nfor sufficiently large Mg\u0303 . Conversely, for sufficiently large Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP , the acceptance tends to be\nrelatively flat, but falls dramatically for Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP <\n\u223c 450 GeV for signal regions A, B, and D,\nand for an even larger range of the mass difference for the high-mass signal region E. For severe\ncompression Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP < 150 GeV, the signal regions A and B can be seen to retain acceptance\nmore than the signal regions D and E do, although in each case the acceptance declines to well\nbelow 1% for the most extreme compression, even when the gluino mass is very large.\nThe acceptances for the heavy squark models of class II are similarly shown in Figure 3 for\ngluino masses from 300 up to 1000 GeV. Here the acceptance tends to increase more steadily with\nincreasing Mg\u0303 . There is sometimes a notable decrease in acceptance for signal regions A and B\nas the mass difference Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP increases, so that the largest acceptances are achieved with\nnon-zero compression, that is, when Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP is not maximum. This perhaps surprising effect,\nstudied in [2], is due to the fact that as the compression increases, the meff distribution becomes\nsoft faster than the ETmiss distribution does, so that more events pass the ETmiss /meff cuts.\nThe acceptances for models in classes III (heavy winos) and IV (heavy squarks and winos) are\nqualitatively similar, and so are not shown.\nIn Figure 4, we show contours of cross-section times acceptance for all five signal regions, for\neach of the model classes I, II, III, IV in separate panels. The contours for each signal region are\nfor the corresponding ATLAS limits on non-Standard Model processes listed in Table I (taken from\n[3]), so that the regions to the left of each contour may be regarded as the approximate exclusion\nregions for that signal definition. In the panels for model classes I and II, the (orange) dotted line\nindicates the case c = 0 in which the ratio of gaugino masses at the TeV scale is approximately the\nsame as mSUGRA. For the light squark class of models I, the best signal regions for exclusion are\n\n\f1\n\nMsquarks = 0.96 MGluino\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\nMGluino=\n\n0.001\n0\n\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\nB (3 jets, meff>1000) acceptance\n\nA (2 jets, meff>1000) acceptance\n\n7\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\n1\n\nMsquarks = 0.96 MGluino\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\nMGluino=\n\n0.001\n0\n\n1\n\nMsquarks = 0.96 MGluino\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0\n\nMGluino=\n\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\nMGluino - MLSP (GeV)\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\nMGluino - MLSP (GeV)\nE (4 jets, meff incl>1100) acceptance\n\nD (4 jets, meff>1000) acceptance\n\nMGluino - MLSP (GeV)\n\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\n1\n\nMsquarks = 0.96 MGluino\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n0\n\nMGluino=\n\n1300\n1200\n1100\n1000\n900\n800\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n\nMGluino - MLSP (GeV)\n\nFIG. 2: Acceptances for the four signal regions A, B, D, E defined in Table I, for the class of models I\ndefined in the text.

Because the gluino and squark decays in this class of models do not pass through\nthe intermediate cascade step of winos, the visible energy per jet tends to be larger, leading to\nstronger exclusions as shown. In both of the model classes I and III with squarks slightly lighter\nthan the gluino, we find that even in the case of extreme compression one can still set a limit of\nbetter than Mg\u0303 > 600 GeV.\nIn models with heavy squarks, the limits are much worse, since the main SUSY production is\nonly gluino pairs.

The middle line in each case is the same result as in Figure\n4. The corresponding left and right contours show the impact of decreasing and increasing the total signal\nproduction rate by 25%. The two panels correspond to the models I (light squarks, left) and II (heavy\nsquarks, right).\n\nThe preceding results were all obtained using the Prospino NLO default renormalization and\nfactorization scale choices and without taking into account the possible systematic uncertainties in\nthe signal production cross sections. In general, uncertainties in QCD production cross-sections are\nnotoriously difficult to estimate. It is well-known that variation of renormalization and factorization\nscales and PDFs do not give reliable estimates of the production cross-section uncertainties. To\nillustrate the potential impacts of these uncertainties, we show in Figure 5 how the results vary\nwhen changing the assumed total signal cross-section by \u00b125% for the models of class I and II. Only\nthe two signal regions that give the strongest limits over the most significant ranges of Mg\u0303 \u2212 MLSP\nare shown in each case. This variation results in a change in the gluino mass limit in these models\nthat can exceed \u00b150 GeV, depending on the model parameters.\nV.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\n\u221a\nIn this paper, we have studied the reach of 1 fb\u22121 of LHC data at s = 7 TeV for compressed\nSUSY models, extending our earlier results for 35 pb\u22121 in [2]. We found that even in the most\ncompressed case studied, in which the gluino is only about 9% heavier than the LSP, the limit on the\ngluino mass should be about Mg\u0303 > 600 GeV for squarks that are slightly lighter than the gluino, and\nabout Mg\u0303 > 450 GeV when squarks are very heavy. The best limits (and discovery potential) come\nfrom signal regions which require 2 or 3 jets. In designing future searches for compressed SUSY,\nit is probable that the best reach will be obtained by increasing the cut on ETmiss as necessary\nto reduce the backgrounds, rather than by very hard cuts on meff (or HT ). This is because as\nthe compression increases, both the ETmiss and meff distributions get softer, but the latter more\n\n\f11\ndrastically. (A more precise quantitative statement about this is beyond the scope of this paper,\nsince it would require detailed background estimates including crucially detector response-specific\ninformation.) Future searches should take into account that signal regions optimized for mSUGRA\nand for simplified models with massless or light LSPs will therefore not do very well for compressed\nSUSY models, and this effect will become more significant as higher mass scales are probed.\nAcknowledgments: The work of TJL was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy,\nDivision of High Energy Physics, under Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.
