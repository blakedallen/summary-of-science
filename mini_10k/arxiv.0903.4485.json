Axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are two of\nthe leading candidates for dark matter. Axion detection experiments include ADMX [1],\nCAST [2], Germanium detectors [3], etc. WIMPs may be detected in a variety of ways, both\ndirectly and indirectly. Direct detection experiments include DAMA [4], CDMS [5], Zeplin\n[6], Edelweiss [7], etc. Indirect detection experiments include various accelerator and gamma\nray search experiments. WIMPs are also relevant to various astrophysical phenomena such\nas the formation of early stars [8], stellar evolution [9], etc.\nSupersymmetry provides a stable, neutral dark matter candidate called the neutralino.\nNeutralinos do not decay into standard model particles, but they annihilate in pairs, releasing\nphotons, neutrinos, and charged particles. The energy released by particle annihilation\nis proportional to the square of the dark matter density and hence, most of the energy\nis produced by annihilation in dark matter halos. The earliest WIMPy halos form at a\nredshift z \u223c 60, with masses M \u223c 10\u22126 M [10], and are thought to be compact and\nabundant. Accretion and mergers result in more massive halos, in a bottom-up approach.\nWe restrict ourselves to the case of thermally produced WIMPs with an annihilation cross\nsection determined by the relic density today.\nObservations of the CMB polarization complement information obtained from the temperature anisotropy spectrum. The absence of strong Ly-\u03b1 absorption lines (the Gunn-Peterson\ntest [11]) in the spectra of quasars for z < 6 implies that the Universe is nearly fully ionized\ntoday. The WMAP measured optical depth may be used to place constraints on reionization\nmodels. Sudden reionization models with full ionization at redshifts below z\u2217 \u223c 11 result\nin a peak in the CMB polarization power spectrum at low multipoles (large angles). The\npolarization power spectrum at large angles is sensitive to the assumed reionization model.\nFuture experiments such as Planck [12] and CMBPol [13] may be used to distinguish between\ndifferent reionization models [14]. In this article, we compare the dark matter reionization\nscenario with the simple case of the sudden reionization model.\nAnother powerful probe of the epoch of reionization, and the Universe prior to reionization, is the Hydrogen 21 cm line. Observations of the fluctuations in the H21 cm differential\nbrightness temperature serve as a probe of the Universe at redshifts z < 200 [15]. Before\nthe formation of the first luminous sources, the H21 cm signal is expected to be negligible\n< 30. This scenario is altered if dark matter annihilation provides a source of\nat redshifts z \u223c\nheating. Future experiments such as LOFAR [16] and the Square Kilometer Array [17] aim\nto study the fluctuations in the H21 cm temperature, and provide important information\nregarding reionization and the high redshift Universe. Several authors have studied the impact of particle annihilation on reionization [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and the Hydrogen 21 cm\nsignal [23, 24, 25, 26]. In this article, we investigate possible signatures of dark matter annihilation in the CMB and Hydrogen 21 cm power spectra at redshifts before the formation\nof the first luminous objects, i.e. between z \u223c 60 and z \u223c 10.\nIn Section II, we consider dark matter halos fitted with an NFW profile, and calculate\nthe luminosity of the halos. We then compute the energy absorbed by gas at any redshift z\ndue to particle annihilation in dark matter halos at redshifts z 0 > z. Some of the absorbed\nenergy results in ionization and heating. We include the effect of gas heating in computing\n2\n\n\fthe evolution of the ionized fraction, thus improving upon the calculation in [20].\nIn Section III, we calculate the optical depth due to scattering of free electrons with CMB\nphotons. Early ionization results in more scattering of free electrons with CMB photons, and\nhence a larger polarization signal. However, the partial ionization at high redshifts requires\na smaller ionization at low redshifts in order to keep the optical depth constant. Thus the\nlarge angle polarization power spectrum is modified. The effect is small, but detectable for\nsmall particle masses (m\u03c7 \u223c 2 GeV), and favorable halo parameters.\nIn Section IV, we study the Hydrogen 21 cm differential brightness temperature. We\nshow that the increase in gas temperature due to particle annihilation at high redshifts can\nhave an observable effect on the power spectrum of fluctuations, for certain light dark matter\nmodels (m\u03c7 \u223c 10 GeV). As the gas temperature T increases and becomes comparable to the\nCMB temperature T\u03b3 , the amplitude of fluctuations in the H21 cm differential brightness\ntemperature decreases and reaches a minimum. The amplitude of fluctuations then increases\nas T > T\u03b3 . We compare the power spectrum to the standard scenario that includes no dark\nmatter heating. Finally, we present our conclusions.\nII.\n\nPARTICLE ANNIHILATION IN DARK MATTER HALOS.\n\nConsider dark matter halos fitted with a Navarro-Frenk-White(NFW) density profile [27]:\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c1s\n.\n(r/rs ) [1 + r/rs ]2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c1s and rs are constants. We define the concentration parameter c200 = r200 /rs . r200 is\nthe radius at which the enclosed mean density equals 200 times the cosmological average\nmeasured at the redshift zF (M ) at which the halo formed:\n3M\n= \u03c1\u0304(M ) = 200\u03c1c \u03a9m [1 + zF (M )]3 .\n3\n4\u03c0r200\n\n(2)\n\nM = M (r200 ) is the mass of the halo. We set the mass in dark matter to be Mdm =\n(\u03a9dm /\u03a9m ) M . \u03c1c is the critical density, and \u03a9m is the matter fraction. c200 is thus measured\nat the time of halo formation. In this article, we treat c200 as a free parameter, independent\nof the halo mass. Particle annihilation in dark matter halos results in a luminosity (energy\nper unit time) per photon energy = dL/dE\u03b3 given by [28]:\ndN\u03b3\nh\u03c3a vi Z\ndL\ndr 4\u03c0r2 \u03c12 (r)\n=\nE\u03b3 \u00d7\n2\ndE\u03b3\ndE\u03b3\n2 m\u03c7\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ndN\u03b3\nh\u03c3a vi M \u03c1\u0304 \u03a9dm\nE\u03b3\ndE\u03b3\n2 m2\u03c7 3\n\u03a9m\n\n\u00132\n\nf (c200 ).\n\n(3)\n\nm\u03c7 is the particle mass. dN\u03b3 /dE\u03b3 = m\u22121\n\u03c7 dN\u03b3 /dx is the number of photons released per\nannihilation per photon energy. Following [29] for mixed gaugino-higgsino models , we choose\ndN\u03b3 /dx to have the form a e\u2212bx /x1.5 , where a and b are constants for a particular annihilation\nchannel. Averaging over the channels considered in [29], we find a = 0.9, b = 9.56. h\u03c3a vi is\nthe annihilation cross section of the WIMPs times the relative velocity, averaged over the\n\n3\n\n\fvelocity distribution. We set h\u03c3a vi = 3\u00d710\u221226 cm3 /s, assumed independent of v (i.e. s-wave\nannihilation). For the NFW density profile Eq. (1) , we have\nf (c200 ) =\n\nc3200 [1 \u2212 (1 + c200 )\u22123 ]\n.\n3 [ln(1 + c200 ) \u2212 c200 (1 + c200 )\u22121 ]2\n\n(4)\n\nf (c200 ) takes values 18, 45, 150, and 610, for c200 = 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 respectively. In this\npaper, we restrict ourselves to the density profile of Eq. [1]. The luminosity can be much\nlarger for halo profiles that are more cuspy. For density profiles with \u03c1 falling off faster than\nr\u22121.5 , the luminosity is divergent unless a lower cutoff radius is imposed [20].\nA.\n\nInteraction of photons with gas atoms.\n\nConsider dark matter annihilation at a location s0 .

The particle mass m\u03c7 = 50 GeV.\n\ngas contributes to ionization as well as heating. Monte Carlo simulations [35] suggest that\nabout a third of the absorbed energy goes into ionization, while a third goes into heating.\nWe therefore set the efficiency factors \u03b7ion = \u03b7heat = 0.3. Fig. 1(a) shows the average energy\nabsorbed per atom per unit time (E/n(1 + z)3 ), for particle masses m\u03c7 = 10, 50, and 100\nGeV.\nIt is instructive to compare E to the simple approximation E\u2217 :\nE\u2217 (z) =\n\nZ\n\ndM (1 + z)3\n\nZ\ndnh\ndL\n(z, M ) dE\u03b3\n(E\u03b3 , M ),\ndM\ndE\u03b3\n\n(12)\n\nwhich neglects the effect of propagation of photons, and unlike E, is a strictly local function\nof z. Fig. 1(b) compares E and E\u2217 . We see that for light dark matter particles (m\u03c7 \u2248 10\nGeV), about 20% of the energy released is absorbed at high redshifts, falling to \u2248 10% at\nlower redshifts. This is in agreement with the somewhat larger absorption fraction obtained\nby [19] at z = 50, for very light dark matter with mass m\u03c7 = 10 MeV. Assuming the\n< 0.3 \u00d7 0.2 = 6% of the generated energy\nefficiency factors \u03b7ion = \u03b7heat = 0.3, we find that \u223c\ngoes into ionization, and an equal amount into heating. The maximum absorbed fraction\n< 2% each for\nis lower (\u2248 6%) for 100 GeV dark matter particles, with a useful fraction \u223c\nionization and heating. Fig. 2 shows the effect of varying the assumed minimum halo mass\nMmin . The minimum halo mass is set by the free streaming scale which depends on the\nparticle physics of the model.

Assuming H is ionized at z = 6, He is singly ionized at z = 6, and doubly ionized\nat z = 3 [38], we find \u03c4 (z = 6) = 0.04. As this value if less than the WMAP measured [39]\nvalue of \u03c4 \u2248 0.087, we conclude that the Universe is at least partially ionized at redshifts\nz > 6. Let z\u2217 be the redshift below which xion = 1. The simplest model of reionization is one\nin which xion (z) = 0 for z > z\u2217 . In this model, the Universe is assumed to be instantaneously\nreionized at z = z\u2217 . Let us refer to this model as the \"sudden reionization\" scenario. While\nonly an idealization, this model gives us a rough idea of the epoch of reionization. Then, we\ncan rewrite Eq.

The increased scattering at\nhigh redshifts results in a transfer of power from low multipoles to higher multipoles in the\nlarge angle EE and TE polarization spectra, compared to the sudden reionization scenario.\nFig. 6 shows the EE and TE polarization power spectra computed using the CAMB software\n[40], for the two reionization histories considered in Fig. 5. The solid (red) line corresponds\nto the sudden reionization scenario in which xion = 1 for z < z\u2217 and 0 for z > z\u2217 . The\ndashed (blue) line corresponds to the reionization history with DM annihilation taken into\naccount, for a model with m\u03c7 = 2 GeV, c200 = 10. xion = 1 for z < z\u2217 . (compare with\nFig. 5). The scattering of electrons at high redshifts results in a reduced amplitude for\nthe first peak at l \u2248 4 and greater power at slightly higher l. For l > 30, there is very\n11\n\n\flittle difference between the spectra. It may be possible to distinguish these curves with\nfuture experiments such as Planck and CMBPol [13, 14]. However, differentiating between\nthe dark matter models and a model of gradual reionization by astrophysical sources (as\nopposed to the sudden reionization model) will be considerably more challenging. It was\nrecently shown [22] that in certain dark matter models with a large value of h\u03c3a vi, ionization\nby dark matter annihilation is substantially larger. This would result in large modifications\nto the CMB polarization power spectrum as well.\nIV.\n\nTHE HYDROGEN 21 CM LINE.\n\nHydrogen 21 cm cosmology is an important tool to study reionization and the early Universe [15].

At low temperatures, the\nionization fraction is very low, and we expect \u03baH to be the dominant term. \u03bae becomes\nrelevant for larger values of xion which are associated with higher T .

Following [24], we make the assumption that one half of the energy\nthat goes into collisional excitations results in the generation of Ly-\u03b1 photons. With the\nsimple ansatz that a third of the total energy absorbed goes into collisional excitations,\nwe have a fraction \u03b7\u03b1R = 1/6 of the total energy resulting in Ly-\u03b1 photons. \u03a6(\u03bd) is the\nline profile satisfying d\u03bd \u03a6(\u03bd) = 1. We will assume that \u03a6(\u03bd) is sharply peaked about\n\u03bd = \u03bd\u03b1 \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 1015 Hz.

The solid (red) curve shows Tb in\nthe absence of dark matter heating (c200 = 0). Let us refer to this temperature as Tb (no\nDM). The gas temperature with no dark matter heating is labeled T (no DM). For some\nvalues of c200 , the differential brightness temperature Tb starts out smaller than Tb (no DM),\nbut soon crosses this curve. This is caused by the gas temperature T being smaller than\nthe CMB temperature T\u03b3 , yet larger than T (no DM). Eventually T becomes larger than T\u03b3\n(compare with Fig. 4). For (c200 = 20, m\u03c7 = 10 GeV), Tb is larger than Tb (no DM) for all\nz. Conversely, for (c200 = 5, m\u03c7 = 50 GeV), Tb is smaller than Tb (no DM) for all z.

The energy absorbed by the gas at any redshift z depends on the halo\ndensity for redshifts z 0 > z, as seen in Eq. (11). The integration over redshifts in Eq. (11)\nresults in the perturbations averaging out as statistically, overdense regions are as likely to\nexist as underdense regions. As a first approximation, we may ignore perturbations\nin halo\n\u221a\ndensity. The fractional perturbation caused by the dark matter halos \u221d 1/ N where N is\nthe\nprovided\n\u221a number of halos in a mean free path volume.

The strong frequency\ndependence of the multi-frequency angular power spectrum may be used to separate the\nsignal from the much larger foregrounds which are expected to be highly correlated over\nsuch small frequency ranges [43].\nD.\n\nVariation with redshift.\n\nz=15\nz=20\nz=25\nz=30\n\nz=15\nz=20\nz=25\nz=30\n\nz=15\nz=20\nz=25\n1 z=30\n10\u22121\n\n10\u22122\n\nTb,0\n\n!\n\nl(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0 (mK)\n\nLet us now consider the variation of the amplitude of the power spectrum with redshift\nor equivalently, with frequency \u03bd = \u03bd0 /(1 + z).

Plots (a) and (b) are shown for m\u03c7 = 10 and 50 GeV respectively, for an assumed\nconcentration parameter c200 = 5. (c) shows the case of no dark matter heating. In (a) the\namplitude of the power spectrum of fluctuations decreases as z is increased from 15 to 25,\nand then increases from 25 to 30. The variation of Cl with z is due to the heating of the\ngas by dark matter annihilation. As the gas temperature increases, T approaches T\u03b3 , and\nhence the differential brightness temperature decreases, resulting in a loss of power. The\npower spectrum reaches a minimum when T = T\u03b3 and then increases again as T > T\u03b3 (the\n19\n\n\f21 cm background now appears in emission). This behavior is in contrast with (c) which\nshows a steady increase in power as the redshift is varied from 15 to 30. Thus observations\nof 21 cm fluctuations at different redshifts may be used to identify light dark matter models.\nThe curves in (b) do not show a minimum with change in redshift. This is because for\nc200 = 5 and m\u03c7 = 50 GeV, the gas temperature T never rises above the CMB temperature\n(see Fig. 4). Hence this effect is only visible with light dark matter models, or with large\nconcentration parameters.\nFig. 12 shows the effect of variation with redshift, for l = 1000, and for c200 = 2.5, 5, and\n7.5.

Thus, for model (b) we would expect the power spectrum\nto show a minimum at this redshift when m\u03c7 = 50 GeV, c200 = 7.5.

For redshifts z < 15, this\nassumption is bound to break down as luminous astrophysical objects heat up and ionize the\nUniverse. However, we expect that dark matter annihilation remains the dominant heating\nsource at redshifts z > 20. Let us now consider the effect of astrophysical sources on the\nbrightness temperature.\n20\n\n\fA.\n\nRegion around early stars\n\nLet us first consider the formation of the earliest stars. These stars are massive, hot,\nmetal-free, and form in dark matter halos with masses Mhalo > 7 \u00d7 105 M [44]. Each such\nstar is surrounded by a hot, ionized region (radius Ri ) which in turn is surrounded by a\nwarm neutral region (radius Rn ). After the star has exhausted its fuel in a short time\n\u2206z \u2248 0.1 (\u2206t/Myr) at z = 25, the gas surrounding the star cools adiabatically, while the\nionized region becomes partially neutral. In this simple estimate, we ignore the formation\nof supernovae, black holes, etc.\nLet us consider stars with mass Mstar \u223c 100 M and lifetime \u223c few Myr. The size and\ntemperature of the ionized and neutral regions surrounding Pop.III stars have been estimated\nin [45]. Following [45], we set a threshold temperature of 104 K for the central ionized region\nup to Ri = 3 kpc, at an assumed formation redshift zs = 25. The gas temperature drops\nquickly to the cosmological average of \u2248 10 K at Rn = 8 kpc. For simplicity, we approximate\nthe temperature dependence on radius of [45] by a power law T (r, z = 25) \u2248 104 K (Ri /r)7.13 .\nThe differential brightness temperature averaged over the sphere surrounding a single star\nis\nZ\nZ\nhTb i = N d\u03a9 ds Tb (s, \u03b8),\n(53)\n\nwhere the integrals are over the solid angle subtended by a single sphere when observed by an\ninstrument, and the line of sight passing through the sphere. N is a suitable normalization\nconstant. We have assumed here that single spheres are too small to be individually resolved.\n\u03bec and \u03be\u03b1 are computed from Eq. (27) and Eq. (28), with E being the thermal energy. We\nfind hTb i = +1.22 mK at z = 25, increasing to a peak value of +1.41 mK at z = 22.7, and\ndecreasing thereafter. The low value of hTb i is due to the high degree of ionization of the\ncentral core and the rapid decrease in temperature away from the core. The temperature\nobserved by an instrument = f hTb i + (1 \u2212 f ) Tother . f is a \"filling fraction\" which takes\ninto account that the individual spheres are in general, non-overlapping. Tother represents\nthe contribution due to other sources. Using the star formation rate of [46], we estimate\nf \u223c \u03c0Rn3 n\u2217 (z = 25) \u2248 0.3 where n\u2217 (z) is the number density of stars at z. Thus, if the dark\nmatter is light (m\u03c7 \u223c 10 GeV), we expect gas heating from early star formation to be only\na small correction to the heating caused by particle annihilation, at high redshifts. Heavier\ndark matter particles (m\u03c7 \u223c 50 GeV) with low concentration parameters c200 \u223c 5 may be\nharder to distinguish from early stars.\nB.\n\nGlobal evolution of the brightness temperature.\n\nThe hot bubble framework discussed in the previous subsection is not applicable at late\ntimes, when the bubbles coalesce. Let us briefly discuss the astrophysical models considered\nby Pritchard and Loeb [47] who compute the global evolution of the 21 cm brightness\ntemperature in the presence of astrophysical sources. Three models (named A,B, and C)\nare considered in [47] depending on the star formation efficiency, and the number of ionizing,\nLy-\u03b1, and X-ray photons produced by the sources. At a redshift z = 25, the spin temperature\nis nearly equal to the CMB temperature and the brightness temperature relative to the CMB\n\u223c -2 mK for all models (see Fig. 1 of [47]). For smaller redshifts, the spin temperature starts\nto follow the gas temperature again due to increased Ly-\u03b1 coupling, resulting in a minimum\nat z \u2248 17 with a H21 cm differential brightness temperature \u2248 \u2212100 mK for models A\n21\n\n\fand B and \u2248 -75 mK for model C. The ionized fraction is still very small. The differential\nbrightness temperature passes through zero, becoming positive at z \u2248 14 \u2212 15, as the gas is\nheated above the CMB temperature. A local maximum is reached at z \u2248 12 \u2212 14, quickly\nfalling off to zero at lower redshifts as the Universe reionizes.\nThese models based on gas heating by luminous sources also exhibit a minimum in the\namplitude of fluctuations at redshifts z \u2248 14 \u2212 15, when the gas temperature exceeds the\nCMB temperature (as long as xion is still small), as described in the previous section. Thus\ndetecting a minimum in the power spectrum at redshifts z < 15 cannot be interpreted as due\nto the presence of WIMP dark matter. For higher redshifts z > 20, astrophysical sources\nhave very little influence upon the global gas temperature and the average 21 cm differential\nbrightness temperature. We therefore expect our results based on dark matter heating to\nremain valid at these redshifts. The existence of a minimum in the amplitude of fluctuations\nat redshifts z > 20 would be a possible indication of heating by dark matter annihilation.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\n\nWe studied the effect of dark matter annihilation on the CMB polarization and the H21\ncm power spectra, for different values of the particle mass, and assumed halo concentration\nparameter. We considered dark matter halos fitted with an NFW profile, and computed\ntheir luminosity. We used the Press-Schechter theory to determine the number of dark\nmatter halos, and derived an expression for the energy absorbed by gas at a given redshift z.\nWe compared this value to the energy generated at z and found that only a small fraction\nof the generated energy is absorbed (Fig. 1, peak absorption \u223c 20% for 10 GeV WIMPs,\nand \u223c 6% for 100 GeV WIMPs). About 30% of the absorbed energy goes into ionization\nand an equal amount into heating. We also considered the effect of varying the minimum\nhalo mass which is determined by the particle physics model (Fig. 2). We did not include\nsecondary ionizations, bremsstrahlung processes, etc, nor did we account for the increase in\nhalo density with time. Thus, more accurate treatments could result in a larger absorption of\nenergy. We computed the evolution of the ionized fraction (Fig. 3) and the gas temperature\n(Fig. 4) with redshift, for different values of the dark matter particle mass m\u03c7 and assumed\nconcentration parameter c200 .\nWe then investigated the observable effects of ionization. We assumed a reionization\nmodel characterized by a redshift z\u2217 such that xion = 1 for z < z\u2217 . In models with dark\nmatter annihilation, xion 6= 0 for z > z\u2217 . We compared these models with the standard reionization model and calculated the value of z\u2217 for different particle masses and concentration\nparameters, for an optical depth \u03c4 = 0.087 (Table I). Figs. 5 and 6 show the reionization\nhistory and polarization power spectra for the model with m\u03c7 = 1 GeV, c200 = 10. The\nchange in the polarization power spectrum is small, but observable for very light (\u223c 1 GeV)\ndark matter particles, and for favorable halo parameters (c200 \u223c 10). Future CMB experiments such as Planck and CMBPol may be able to distinguish the two scenarios, and hence\ndistinguish light dark matter models from others. It will however be difficult to distinguish\nthe dark matter reionization scenario from another model with gradual reionization.\nWe also studied the effect of dark matter annihilation on the Hydrogen 21 cm power\nspectrum. In Fig. 7, we compared the collisional and Ly-\u03b1 coupling terms. Fig. 8 shows the\ndifferential brightness temperature of H21 cm radiation Tb , for m\u03c7 = 10 and 50 GeV and\nfor concentration parameters c200 = 5, 10, and 20. Also shown is the case of no dark matter\nheating (c200 = 0). We then considered perturbations to the baryon density (\u03b4n ), ionized\n22\n\n\ffraction (\u03b4x ), and gas temperature (\u03b4T ), and computed the multifrequency angular power\nspectrum of fluctuations Cl (\u03bd, \u2206\u03bd) in Tb . Fig. 9 shows the time evolution and the relative\namplitude of ionization and temperature fluctuations, assuming \u03b4x = \u03b4T = \u03b4n initially. It was\nshown that ionization and temperature fluctuations are not very significant at low redshifts\n(z < 30). We studied the variation of the power spectrum Cl (\u03bd, \u2206\u03bd) with frequency \u2206\u03bd.\n> 1 MHz, while for l = 5000, Cl falls off to \u2248 0 for \u2206\u03bd > 0.1\nFor l = 500, Cl \u2248 0 for \u2206\u03bd \u223c\n\u223c\nMHz. The frequency dependence of Cl (\u03bd, \u2206\u03bd) may be used to separate the Hydrogen 21\ncm signal from the foreground contaminants. Fig. 11 shows the H21 power spectrum for\ndifferent redshifts. Fig. 11(a) shows the case m\u03c7 = 10 GeV, c200 = 5. In this model, the\namplitude of fluctuations decreases as z is increased from 15 to 25, and then increases from\n25 to 30. This behavior is due to the gas temperature T approaching the CMB temperature\nT\u03b3 and then increasing beyond T\u03b3 . Fig. 11(b) (m\u03c7 = 50 GeV, c200 = 5) does not show a\nminimum at any redshift, and is a monotonous function of z. This is because for this model,\nthe gas temperature T never exceeds the CMB temperature at any redshift in the considered\nrange (compare Fig. 4(a) with Fig. 4(b)). Fig. 11(c) shows the power spectrum for the\nstandard scenario with no dark matter heating. Fig. 12 shows the variation of the power\nspectrum with redshift in the range 15 to 30, for l = 1000, for different values of c200 . In\n(a), the power spectrum shows a minimum with redshift for all values of c200 6= 0 (compare\nwith Fig. 11(a)). In (b), the models with c200 = 2.5 and 5 show no minimum (compare\nwith Fig. 11(b)), while the model with c200 = 7.5 shows a minimum at z = 16.4. Future\nHydrogen 21 cm experiments such as LOFAR and SKA may be able to distinguish light\ndark matter models (m\u03c7 \u223c 10 GeV) from the standard scenario by measuring the power\nspectrum at different redshifts. However, it would be difficult to distinguish models with\nlarger dark matter masses (m\u03c7 \u223c 50 GeV) from the standard scenario, except for favorable\nhalo parameters (c200 > 10). In certain dark matter models where the dark matter particle\nis produced by a non-thermal mechanism, the annihilation rate can be much larger than in\nthe standard scenario considered here. In such cases, the ionization and heating rates are\nsubstantially higher [22] which may make it easier to distinguish the effects of dark matter\nannihilation from other sources.\nFinally, we discussed the effect of astrophysical sources on our calculations. We found\nthat at high redshifts, heating by early stars is not a very large effect, especially for light\ndark matter particles. Later star formation at lower redshifts, and the formation of the first\ngalaxies will likely be larger contaminants. We discussed the evolution of the brightness\ntemperature at lower redshifts in the models of [47]. Heating by astrophysical sources\nalso results in a minimum in the amplitude of fluctuations at redshifts z < 15. However\nfor redshifts z > 20, we expect dark matter annihilation to be the relevant effect. Thus\ndetecting a minimum in the amplitude of Hydrogen 21 cm fluctuations at z > 20 would be\na possible indication of heating by dark matter annihilation.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for many comments which\nhelped improve the manuscript.
