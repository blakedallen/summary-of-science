This Anderson's work is shown to\ncontain a number of inaccurate and ungrounded statements. We point out, in\nparticular, that the total static dielectric function not only can be negative, but\ninevitably has a minus sign in many stable systems. We also demonstrate that in many\nmetals, the effective electron-phonon interaction is stronger than the direct Coulomb\nrepulsion, without taking into account the ladder-sum renormalization or pseudization\nof the Coulomb repulsion. Other issues touched in paper [1] are also discussed.\nRecently, P.W. Anderson has published the paper \"Do we need (or want) a bosonic glue to pair\nelectrons in high-Tc superconductors?\" [1], which, in our opinion, contains a number of\ninaccurate and ungrounded statements. One of these statements is related to the old discussion\nbetween P.W. Anderson and group of the Lebedev Physical Institute. It concerns possible signs\nof the static dielectric constant. Previously, Cohen and Anderson in their early paper [2] used the\nsimple expression for the electron-electron interaction in a metal:\nV (q, \u03c9 ) =\n\n4\u03c0 e 2\n,\nq 2\u03b5 tot (q, \u03c9 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5tot(q, \u03c9) is the momentum- and frequency-dependent total dielectric function. This\nfunction includes the screening due to the Coulomb interaction and a contribution of the\nelectron-phonon interaction (EPI). By considering that the static dielectric function \u03b5(q, 0)\nsatisfies the inequality\n(2)\n\u03b5 (q, \u03c9 ) > 0 ,\nthe authors of Ref. 2 have shown that this inequality results in a strong limitation on possible\nvalues of the critical temperature of superconducting transition Tc. This limitation is due to the\ninterrelation between the Coulomb repulsion constant \u03bc and the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant \u03bb, which follows from inequality (2):\n\u03bc>\u03bb .\n\n(3)\n\nThis means that an effective electron-electron interaction is repulsive. Superconductivity cannot\noccur in such a system. As Tolmachev has shown [3], there is a the ladder-sum renormalization\nor pseudization of the Coulomb repulsion to a smaller value,\n\n\u03bc* =\n\n\u03bc\n,\n1 + \u03bc ln (\u03b5 F / \u03c9 D )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5F, is the Fermi energy and \u03c9D is an average phonon energy. Thus, the effective\ninteraction can become attractive, \u03bb \u2013 \u03bc* > 0. The term \u03bb \u2013 \u03bc* appears in various approximate\nexpressions for Tc and at \u03bb = \u03bc the limitation on maximum value of Tc, that follows from those\nexpressions, leads to the inequality\n\n1\n\n\fTc \u2272 \u03b5 F exp(\u2212 1/ \u03bb ) \u2272 10 K (!)\nThe above arguments are mostly repeated in paper [1].\nWe discussed this problem in detail in our review [4]. Here, in order to solve at least this\nissue once and for all, we briefly repeat our results that demonstrate the existence of negative\nvalues of \u03b5(q, 0) in many simple systems just in their stability region. One of simple systems\nwith \u03b5(q, 0) negative at any momentum q is the Wigner crystal. The dielectric function \u03b5(q, \u03c9) of\nclassical Wigner crystal has been thoroughly considered by Bagchi [5] who showed that\n\n\u03c9 pl\n1\n= 1\u2212 2\n\u03b5 (q, \u03c9 )\nq\n2\n\n\u2211\u03bb \u03c9\n\n(qe )\n\n2\n\nq\u03bb\n\n2\n\n(q, \u03bb ) \u2212 \u03c9 2\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nHere, \u03c9pl is the plasma frequency of charged particles:\n4\u03c0 ne 2\n,\n\u03c9 =\nm\n2\npl\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m and n are the mass and density of the particles, respectively, eq\u03bb is the polarization\nvector of phonons, and \u03c9(q, \u03bb) is the phonon frequency.\nIn a cubic Wigner crystal with one atom per unit cell, there are three phonon modes, two\ntransversal modes with acoustic dispersions at small q vectors and one longitudinal mode whose\nfrequency \u03c9(q, \u03bb) approaches to \u03c9pl at q \u2192 0. The sum rule\n\n\u2211\u03bb \u03c9\n\n2\n\n(q, \u03bb ) =\u03c9 pl2\n\n(7)\n\nis valid for those frequencies. In the static case, expression (5) can be rewritten as\n\u23a7\u23aa\n\u23a1\n\u03c9 pl2 \u23a4 \u23ab\u23aa\n1\n2\n= \u2211 \u23a8(ne q\u03bb ) \u23a21 \u2212 2\n\u23a5\u23ac ,\n\u03b5 (q,0) \u03bb \u23aa\u23a9\n\u23a3\u23a2 \u03c9 (q, \u03bb ) \u23a6\u23a5 \u23aa\u23ad\n\n(8)\n\nwhere n = q/|q|. Here, we took into account that\n\n\u2211\u03bb (ne \u03bb )\n\n2\n\nq\n\n=1 .\n\n(9)\n\nWith the account for the sum rule (7), one can easily see that the right-hand side of expression\n(8) is always negative at any q vector. Notice that, according to expression (8), the inequality\n\u03b5(q, 0) < 0 is valid just in the stable phase of Wigner crystal, when all the quantities \u03c92(q, \u03bb) are\npositively defined, i.e., \u03c92(q, \u03bb) > 0.\nIt follows from the above that in the Wigner crystal, the negative values of \u03b5(q, 0) occur\nbecause the single mode of the plasma oscillations, that exists in gaseous and liquid states, is\nsplit to three modes in the solid state. This is due to the localization of charges and strong localfield effects in the crystal. Furthermore, as has been shown in Ref. 6, the negative values of\n\u03b5(q, 0) occur in the classical one-component plasma when the interaction parameter \u0393 = e2/(aT)\n[here, a = (4n/3)-1/3] is considerably smaller than its value at which the Wigner crystallization\ntakes place, \u0393 \u2248 170. As is shown in paper (6), the static dielectric function \u03b5(q, 0) is negative\nvirtually at all q vectors in the density range corresponding to \u0393 > 40. It is intriguing that at \u0393 >\n40 the plasma oscillations have the negative dispersion [\u03c9pl2(q) = \u03c9pl2(0) \u2013 \u03b1q2] and a finite\n2\n\n\flinewidth. It is also shown in Ref. 6 that the negative values of \u03b5tot(q, 0) exist not only in model\nsystems, but also in real systems, e.g., in melted table salt.\nThe above-considered systems possessing the negative static dielectric function \u03b5(q, 0)\nhave, of course, nothing to do with high-temperature superconductivity and with\nsuperconductivity in general. Within the 'folklore' approach, the negative values of \u03b5(q, 0)\nensure that the inequality \u03bb > \u03bc is fulfilled. The simple expression (1) can be applied as it is only\nfor a hypothetical highly-compressed metal where the parameter of Coulomb interaction rs\nsatisfies the condition rs << 1. Here, rs=(3n/4\u03c0aB3)1/3 and n and aB are the density and the Bohr\nradius of the electrons, respectively. In this case the dielectric function \u03b5tot(q, 0) can be written in\nthe form [7, 8]\n\u23a7\u23aa\n\u23a1\n\u03c9 jl2 (q) \u23a4 \u23ab\u23aa\n1\n4\u03c0e 2\n2\n(\n)\n= 2\n\u2212\nne\n1\n(10)\n\u2211 \u23a8 q\u03bb \u23a2 \u03c9 2 (q, \u03bb ) \u23a5 \u23ac\u23aa .\n\u03b5 tot (q,0) q \u03b5 el (q,0) \u03bb \u23aa\u23a9\n\u23a6\u23a5 \u23ad\n\u23a3\u23a2\nHere, \u03b5el(q, 0) is the static dielectric function of the electron gas, which can be expressed within\nRPA as\n\n\u03b5 el (q,0) = 1 +\n\n\u03c72\nq2\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c9(q, \u03bb) is the phonon frequency, and \u03c9jl2(q) is the plasma frequency of the jelly-like model:\n\n\u03c9 (q) =\n2\njl\n\n\u03c9 pl2\n\u03b5 el (q,0)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nIt is easy to show [7, 8] that for a stable phase of the highly-compressed metal the inequality\n\n\u03c9 2jl (q) \u2265 \u03c9 2 (q, \u03bb )\n\n(13)\n\nis valid. This inequality guarantees that in the highly-compressed metal the static dielectric\nfunction is negative at all q vectors and the inequality \u03bb \u2013 \u03bc* > 0 is satisfied. This means that,\nowing to the EPI, superconductivity can exist in this metal without any pseudization of the\nCoulomb repulsion. Certainly, at rs << 1 the EPI coupling constant \u03bb is small and Tc is low.\nIn our early work [7] we have calculated \u03b5tot(q, 0) for several simple metals (K, Al, Pb)\nand for hypothetical metallic hydrogen. We have shown [7] that for potassium, \u03b5tot(q, 0) is\npositive at all q vectors, while for Pb and metallic hydrogen it is negative at any q. The reason\nfor this is more or less the same as in the Wigner crystal. As follows from Eqs. (10) \u2013 (13), the\nphonon contribution to the dielectric function \u03b5tot(q, 0) is negative and exceeds the electron\ncontribution because of the strong local-field effects in the system of localized ions.\nEven for many conventional metals the electron-electron interaction that describes the\nsuperconducting state has a more complex form [8]. The main problem here is the successive\ncalculation of the contribution of Coulomb interaction \u03bc to the effective electron-electron\ninteraction. As for the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb, there are highly efficient densityfunctional methods (see, e.g., [9, 10]) for calculating \u03bb, at least for conventional metals.\nNumerous calculations and tunneling measurements show that in many conventional metals and\ntheir compounds, \u03bb \u2273 1. Moreover, as has been shown in Ref. 11, the coupling constant \u03bb in\nmetallic hydrogen can reach the value of 6. In all these metals, the relation \u03bb \u2273 1 is valid at\naverage electron densities corresponding to rs \u2248 1. In a homogeneous electron gas at rs < 1, the\nconstant \u03bc of the Coulomb electron-electron interaction can be written as [8]\n\n3\n\n\f\u03bc=\n\nrs\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nThis means that even at rs \u2248 1, the inequality \u03bc < 1 is still valid. We notice that the maximum\nvalue of \u03bc, as is said in Ref. 2, does not exceed \u03bc = 1/2. In ordinary metals, the Coulomb\nelectron-electron interaction is only weakly affected by the crystal lattice. This is evident, for\nexample, from the good coincidence of the plasma energy of electrons in a conventional metal\nand in a homogeneous electron gas with the same average density. In addition, the dispersion of\nplasma oscillations in the both systems is positive:\n\u03c9pl2(q) = \u03c9pl2(0) + \u03b1q2 ,\n\n(15)\n\n\u03a9 2pl\n3.01 2\nVie (q ) 2\nrs\n\u03c9\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b1 > 0.\nContrary to the Coulomb electron-electron interaction, the EPI in crystals differs\nessentially from the case of simple homogeneous jelly-like models. In such models, both the\nelectron-electron and electron-ion coupling are defined by the ordinary Coulomb interaction,\nhence \u03bb \u2248 \u03bc. In the simple approximation, the EPI constant can be expressed as [8]\n\n\u03bb=\n\n.\n\nHere, Vie2 (q ) is the average square of the electron-ion pseudopotential, \u03c9 is the phonon\nfrequency, and \u03a9pl is the ion plasma frequency:\n\u03a9 2pl =\n\n4\u03c0 NZ 2 e 2\n.\nM\n\n(17)\n\nThe average phonon frequencies in metals are considerably lower than the ion plasma frequency.\nThis results in relatively high values of \u03bb as compared to \u03bc. As is noticed above, the reason for\nthis is the correlations and local field effects in the ionic system, as well as an additional (relative\nto the Wigner crystal) screening of the frequencies of the ion vibrations by the conduction\nelectrons. In many cases, in particular in alkali metals, the smallness of the average square of the\nelectron-ion pseudopotential Vie2 (q ) is an essential factor that lowers the value of \u03bb.\nIt follows from our analysis that the static dielectric constant not only can be negative,\nbut must necessarily be negative in a number of systems, namely in their stable state. In some\nmodel metallic systems, for example, in highly-compressed metals with rs << 1, the EPI constant\n\u03bb inevitably exceeds the constant \u03bc of the Coulomb electron-electron interaction. There are,\nhowever, less rigorous, but quite plausible arguments [8, 12] in favor of the fact that in many\nconventional metals, \u03bb is actually larger than \u03bc and the pseudization of the Coulomb\ncontribution, i.e. the transition from \u03bc to \u03bc* = \u03bc/[1 + \u03bcln(\u03b5F/\u03c9\u0303)] is not important for the existence\nof the superconducting state.\nDoubts are cast upon some other statements in paper [1], in particular, classifying\ninteractions that exist in superconducting cuprates into mammoths, elephants, and mice.\nAccording to Ref. 1, the exchange interaction of the electrons at neighboring sites, as the\nstrongest one, is appointed mammoth. As is mentioned in Ref. 1, this interaction occurs\nperturbatively in 1/U, where U is the repulsion of the electrons at one site. Thus, the exchange\ncoupling constant is J ~ t2/U, where t is the overlap integral. We should take into account that J\ndescribes not the attractive interaction of the electrons at neighboring sites, but the attraction of\ntheir spins only. The latter attraction is sufficient for antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins. In\nthe framework of the simple Hubbard model, only with the repulsion of electrons at one site, the\nattractive exchange interaction is sufficient for the superconducting state to occur. In reality,\n4\n\n\fhowever, the Coulomb repulsion of electrons exists at neighboring sites, too. As the ARPES\nexperiments demonstrate [13], the holes in CuO2-planes, at least in the optimally doped samples,\nform a system of strongly interacting Fermi particles. Most likely this system cannot be\ndescribed as a Fermi-gas of weakly interacting quasi-particles. As is well known, in the system\nof strongly interacting Coulomb particles the interaction of holes at the average distance between\nthem is of the order of their kinetic energy. This means that the Coulomb repulsion of the holes\nat neighboring sites is V ~ t, i.e., it is substantially stronger than the exchange interaction of the\nspins. Certainly, there are no reasons why V might be much less than t. We do not know any\npublication on this subject, where such reasons are indicated. Likewise, there are no reasons for\nthe EPI in cuprates to be much less than the exchange interaction or direct Coulomb repulsion at\nneighboring sites. The available first-principle calculations of the EPI in cuprates give rather\ncontradictive results concerning the value of the EPI constant, but they do not indicate that the\nEPI is smaller than the exchange interaction [12].\nDoubts are also cast upon the attempt of P.W. Anderson to relate the low-energy\npeculiarities of high-Tc materials to the strong electron scattering caused by the large Hubbard\nrepulsion U. The problem at issue is the existence of so-called 'kinks' in the single-particle\nexcitation spectra of cuprates at 0.03\u20130.09 eV. Usually these peculiarities are ascribed to the\nelectron coupling with bosonic modes. The physical nature of these bosonic modes has long been\nunder discussion. Two possible candidates for these bosons are usually discussed, namely the\nphonons and the spin fluctuations. Sometimes this discussion looks curiously. Recently, two\npapers [14, 15] have been published concerning the calculation of the constant of electron\ncoupling with the spin fluctuations. In Refs. 14 and 15, the same t\u2013J Hamiltonian and the same\nexperimental data are used, but the obtained coupling constants differ by three orders of\nmagnitude. More recently, peculiarities in the cuprates electron spectra at 0.3\u20130.5 eV have been\nalso observed [16]. These high-energy anomalies are likely due to the Hubbard U and to the\nexchange-correlation effects.\nTo conclude, it is necessary to explore in more detail what the \"high-Tc refrigerator\"\ncontains in terms of mammoths, elephants, and mice. We believe that there are still many other\nunsolved problems in high-Tc materials.\nThe authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with many colleagues, first of all, with\nV.L. Ginzburg, M.R. Trunin, M.V. Sadovskii, and M. Kuli\u010d.\nReferences\n[1] P.W. Anderson, cond-mat/0609040; A short version of this article is published in\nScience 317 1705 (2007)\n[2] M.L. Cohen and P.W.
