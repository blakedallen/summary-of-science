Introduction\nClusters of galaxies are known to be the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe. The amplification\nof primordial density fluctuations by gravity is thought to\nbe the origin of structure formation, however the details\nof the formation process are not yet well understood and\nthe study of the structure and properties of dark matter\nhalos and of the intra cluster plasma in virialized systems\ncan give important clues to understand the physics involved in the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.\nNowadays, these studies have undergone great improvements with the developement of advanced observational\nfacilities and techniques, together with the progress of numerical simulations.\nMany works have been developed during the last\ndecades on this respect. Secondary infall and the effects of this process on the cluster structure were disSend offprint requests to: R. Demarco (demarco@iap.fr)\n\u22c6\nBased on data obtained from the public archive of ROSAT\nat the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik.\n\ncussed by Gunn & Gott (1972), and self-similar solutions\nfor dark matter halos and gas were studied in numerical simulations carried out e.g. by Fillmore & Goldreich\n(1984), Bertschinger (1985), Teyssier et al. (1997) and\nSubramanian (2000). Cold Dark Matter (CDM) studies\nbased on high-resolution N-body simulations performed\nby Navarro, Frenk & White (1996, 1997) suggest a cuspy\nand universal dark matter (DM) density profile in galaxies and clusters of galaxies, independent of mass scale\nand cosmology; this result is contradicted by Jing & Suto\n(2000). However, some important observational facts seem\nnot to be reproduced by these studies: numerical simulations based on the CDM scenario predict density profiles\nwith steep inner slopes which fail to reproduce the rotation\ncurves of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies (Flores &\nPrimack 1994; Moore et al. 1999). Although other works\nclaim that cuspy DM profiles are consistent with the available data for dwarfs and LSB galaxies (van den Bosch &\nSwaters 2001), microlensing studies towards the center of\nour galaxy also support the incompatibility between CDM\nsimulations and observational evidence (Binney & Evans\n\n\f2\n\nR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\n2001). To explain the discrepancy concerning the central\nslopes of DM halos (Navarro, Frenk & White 1997; Moore\net al. 1999), the lack of sufficient resolution in the central regions of simulated halos has been proposed; Point\nSpread Function (PSF) effects together with insufficient\nresolution on galaxy rotation curves (van den Bosch &\nSwaters 2001) may be also at the origin of the discrepancy between models and observations.\nObservations in the X-ray band provide valuable information on the hot Intra Cluster Medium (ICM). A\npopular model used to fit the spatial distribution of the\nX-ray gas is the so called \u03b2-model (Cavaliere & FuscoFemiano 1976; Sarazin 1988) which assumes an isothermal ICM. However, this model may not be good enough\nto describe the cluster gas component, since the isothermality of the ICM is still rather controversial. Cooling\nflows are known to produce a drop of the gas temperature towards the center of the cluster; besides, outside the\ncooling flow region things are still not clear. Temperature\nprofiles based on ASCA (White 2000) and ROSAT (Irwin,\nBregman & Evrard 1999) data were found to be consistent with the isothermal hypothesis. On the other hand,\nMarkevitch et al. (1998) found from ASCA observations\nthat cluster temperatures decrease significantly with radius. Irwin & Bregman (2000) analysed BeppoSAX data\nand claimed a slight rise in cluster temperature with radius, a result which is at odds with De Grandi & Molendi\n(2002), who found that for a set of 21 clusters the temperature profile has a clear isothermal core (excluding the cooling flow region) followed by a rapid radial decline. Note\nthat such a core is consistent with Chandra observations\nof cooling flow clusters, where the temperature profile rises\nrapidly with radius, then remains approximately constant\nout to \u223c 0.8 Mpc (Allen, Schmidt & Fabian 2001). Finally,\nXMM-Newton observations e.g. of Coma (Arnaud et al.\n2001) and Abell 1795 (Tamura et al. 2001) show small but\nsignificant radial variations of the temperature. Numerical\nsimulations seem to confirm a decline of temperature profiles with radius, but are not able to reproduce the flatness of these profiles in the innermost regions (Frenk et al.\n1999; Loken et al. 2002). This disagreement may be due\nto additional physical processes that must be taken into\naccount in future numerical simulations. Another point is\nthat a single \u03b2 value cannot always fit the X-ray surface\nbrightness profile of clusters (Allen, Ettori & Fabian 2001;\nAllen, Schmidt & Fabian 2001; Hicks et al. 2002).\nThe ICM density and temperature distributions are\nof fundamental importance because they can be used to\ndetermine the specific entropy distribution of the ICM,\nthus providing important information to understand nongravitational internal and external processes that may\ncontribute to the ICM thermal history, such as external\npreheating and energy injection supernova-driven galaxy\nwinds (Brighenti & Mathews 2001; Dos Santos & Dor\u00e9\n2002). Non-gravitational processes may be responsible for\nthe observed breaking of the self-similar relation between\nX-ray luminosity and temperature predicted by theory\n(Arnaud & Evrard, 1999; Rosati, Borgani & Norman 2002\n\nand references therein) and also the so called Entropy\nFloor (Ponman, Cannon & Navarro, 1999; Helsdon &\nPonman 2000; Lloyd-Davies et al. 2000).\nWith the assumption that the X-ray plasma in clusters of galaxies is weakly dissipative, clusters considered\nas self-gravitating systems are likely to verify properties\nsimilar to those recently found in elliptical galaxies, considered as self-gravitating systems. Namely, the optical\nsurface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies can be fit\nby a S\u00e9rsic law (S\u00e9rsic 1968; Caon et al. 1993; Ciotti &\nBertin 1999):\nh \u0010 s \u0011\u03bd i\n\u03a3(s) = \u03a30 exp \u2212\n(1)\na\ncharacterized by three parameters: \u03a30 (intensity), a (scaling) and \u03bd (shape). For a sample of 132 ellipticals belonging to three galaxy clusters, the S\u00e9rsic parameters\nwere found to be correlated two by two, and in the threedimensional space defined by these three parameters they\nare located on a thin line. These properties have been\ninterpreted as due to the fact that, to a first approximation, all these elliptical galaxies have the same specific\nentropy (entropy per unit mass) (Gerbal et al. 1997, Lima\nNeto et al. 1999, M\u00e1rquez et al. 2000), and that a scaling\nlaw exists between the potential energy U and the mass\nM for these galaxies: U \u221d M 1.72\u00b10.03 (M\u00e1rquez et al.\n2001). Each of these relations defines a two-manifold in the\n[log\u03a30 , loga, \u03bd] space. The thin line on which the galaxies\nare distributed in this space is the intersection of these\ntwo two-manifolds. Such relations are most probably a\nconsequence of the formation and evolution processes undergone by these objects, since theory predicts U \u221d M 5/3\nunder the hypothesis that energy and mass are conserved\n(M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001).\nInterestingly, numerical simulations of cold dark matter haloes in two different mass ranges lead to a similar\nscaling law between the potential energy and mass of the\nhaloes. In the mass range 4 \u00d7 105 \u2264 M \u2264 4 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\n(unvirialized clusters), Jang-Condell & Hernquist (2001)\nfind a relation consistent with U \u221d M 5/3 , while in the\nmass range 1012 \u2264 M \u2264 1015 M\u2299 (virialized clusters)\nLanzoni (2000) finds U \u221d M 1.69\u00b10.02 .\nIn this work, we present a study aimed at testing\nwhether results similar to those found in elliptical galaxies can also be obtained for galaxy clusters, based on an\naccurate modeling of the cluster X-ray surface brightness.\nWe use a de-projection of the S\u00e9rsic profile (Eq. 1) to obtain the gas and DM density distributions, temperature\nprofiles, dynamical mass distributions and estimations of\nthe integrated specific entropies of the gas and DM components for a set of 24 nearby galaxy clusters and a group.\nInteresting correlations between physical quantities are\nfound, comparable to those observed in elliptical galaxies, which can give important clues to understand better\nthe formation and evolution of galaxy clusters.

The sample\nWe have retrieved data taken with the PSPC-B camera\nof ROSAT from the ROSAT archive at MPE. The energy range considered is 0.44\u22122 keV, corresponding to\nthe four energy bands R4 to R7 (Snowden et al. 1994).\nThese bands were chosen in order to avoid the low signal\nto noise ratio in the lower bands due to the high absorption by the hydrogen column. The spatial resolution of\nthe PSPC is 25\" and its energy resolution corresponds\nto 0.43% at 0.93 keV. We selected observations with the\nlongest exposure times and where the cluster showed a regular shape, with no obvious mergers and a smooth light\ncurve (no strong scattered solar X-ray contamination). We\nthus built a sample of 24 clusters (see Table 1) with redshifts ranging between 0.01 and 0.3. Redshifts were taken\nfrom the SIMBAD data base (except for A2199 for which\nthe redshift was obtained from Wu, Xue & Fang 1999), and\ngas temperatures and luminosities from Wu, Xue & Fang\n(1999), except for A2034 and A2382 for which temperatures were taken from Ebeling et al. (1996). We assume\nH0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a90 = 1, and \u039b = 0 throughout this analysis. In order to increase the range in TX ,\nin particular to include cooler systems when drawing the\nLX \u2212 TX relation, we intended to add several groups to\nour sample of clusters. However, we only included in our\nsample the group HCG 62, the one with the longest exposure time and best signal to noise ratio (we also tried to\ninclude HCG 94, but discarded it because of its signal to\nnoise ratio). More groups will be considered in forecoming\nworks.\nThe data reduction was done using the software developed by Snowden et al. (1994). The routines in the software provide the best available modeling and subtraction\nof various non-cosmic background components and corrections for exposure, satellite wobbling, vignetting and\nvariations of detector quantum efficiency. A flat-field correction of the images was applied and the non-extended\nsources were masked, except the cluster centers. The whole\nprocedure was carried out only in clusters without strong\nscattered solar X-ray contamination; for each cluster, we\nchecked the light curves in the 4 energy bands considered,\nand all those with count rate peaks larger than 3 counts\nsec\u22121 in their light curves were excluded.\n\n3\n\ntional potential. Thus, in order to compare theory with observations, a description of the gas distribution is needed.\nUsing a parameter-dependent model for the gas density\nprofile, it is possible to re-construct the 3D X-ray emission of the cluster which, once projected and compared\nto the observations (Sect. 4), will allow us to derive the\nbest set of values for the model parameters. We have chosen a 3D deprojection of a S\u00e9rsic profile (S\u00e9rsic 1968) to\ndescribe the gas distribution in clusters. This choice was\nmotivated by the fact that we already used this profile to\nfit the optical surface brightness of elliptical galaxies, and\ncomputed all the physical quantities needed here, such as\nthe entropy, potential energy, etc., as a function of the\nthree S\u00e9rsic parameters (see M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001 and references therein). Note that from a mathematical point of\nview, since the S\u00e9rsic profile has three parameters instead\nof two (compared to other models as for instance the \u03b2model), the fitting process is more flexible. Besides, the\nfact that the volume integral of this profile does not diverge at large radii allows us to compute important quantities such as the total mass, potential energy and entropy\nof the system without any extra mathematical requirement such as a cutoff radius, for instance. Note also that\nthe S\u00e9rsic law (Eq. (1)) is a non-homologous generalization\nof the de Vaucouleurs R1/4 profile (de Vaucouleurs 1948).\nThe 3D deprojection of such a profile corresponds to a\ngeneralized form of the Mellier-Mathez profile (Mellier &\nMathez 1987) given by:\n\u2212p\n\n\u03c1gas (r) = \u03c10 (r/a)\n\n\u03bd\n\nexp[\u2212(r/a) ]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is the volume gas density associated to the central column density \u03a30 and the parameters p and \u03bd are\nrelated by the numerical approximation (M\u00e1rquez et al.\n2001):\np \u2243 1.0 \u2212 0.6097\u03bd + 0.05563\u03bd 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhich gives the best approximation to the S\u00e9rsic law when\nEq. (2) is projected. The S\u00e9rsic profile defined by Eq. (1)\ncorresponds to a surface mass density while Eq. (2) is the\nvolume mass density. The condition that the mass obtained by integrating Eq. (1) must be equal to the mass\nobtained by integrating Eq. (2) implies:\n\u03c10 =\n\n\u0393( \u03bd2 )\n1\n\u03a30\na\n2 \u0393( 3\u2212p\n\u03bd )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u0393(a)\nR \u221e is the complete gamma function defined by\n\u0393(a) = 0 xa\u22121 e\u2212x dx.\n\n3.2. Dark matter distribution and dynamical mass\n3. Estimating physical quantities\n3.1. Gas density profile\nThe observed X-ray emission of the ICM is directly related\nto the gas distribution in the dark matter halo gravita-\n\nOnce the gas distribution is known, a reasonable hypothesis can be used to derive the dark matter distribution\nin the cluster. Previous works on X-ray clusters suggest a\npower law relation between the distributions of dark matter and gas (e.g. Gerbal et al. 1992; Durret et al. 1994).\nWe will assume here a relative distribution of the DM and\n\n\f4\n\nR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\ngas of the form \u03c1DM /\u03c1gas = R(r), where R(r) is a power\nlaw of the form:\n\u0010 r \u0011\u2212\u03b1\n(5)\nR(r) = \u03ba\na\nUnder this hypothesis, the dark matter also follows\na S\u00e9rsic law: it decreases exponentially above a certain\nradius and its asymptotic behavior towards the cluster\ncentre is a power law of slope p\u2032 = \u2212(p + \u03b1). The values\nfor \u03ba, assuming \u03b1 = 0.25 are given in Table 2 (see Sect. 4).\nUsing Eqs. (5) and (2), the total amount of mass contained within a spherical region of radius r is given by the\nintegral:\nr\n\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0010 \u0011\nu \u2212\u03b1\n+ 1 \u03c1gas (u)4\u03c0u2 du =\n\u03ba\na\n0\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n4\u03c0\u03c10 a3\n3 \u2212 (p + \u03b1) \u0010 r \u0011\u03bd\n3 \u2212 p \u0010 r \u0011\u03bd\n\u03ba\u03b3\n+\u03b3\n,\n,\n(6)\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\na\n\u03bd\na\nMDyn (r, \u03ba, \u03b1) =\n\nZ\n\nwhere \u03b3(a, z)R is the incomplete gamma function defined\nz\nby \u03b3(a, z) = 0 xa\u22121 e\u2212x dx.\n\n3.3. Gas temperature profile\nAn important point in our study is to compute the temperature distribution of the ICM. This can be achieved\nby estimating the gas density profile, obtained by fitting\nthe observations, and assuming that clusters of galaxies\nare systems in a nearly hydrostatical equilibrium sate. A\nhypothesis on the state equation of the ICM gas is also\nneeded. An ideal gas state equation can be considered as\na good approximation, although its application to selfgravitating systems has been questioned in the past (see\nBonnor 1956 and references therein).\nTherefore, the equation of hydrostatical equilibrium:\n\u2207P (r) = \u2212G\n\nMDyn (r)\n\u03c1gas (r)\nr2\n\n(7)\n\nis then combined with the equation of state for the hot\nintra-cluster plasma:\nP (r) =\n\n\u03c1gas (r)\nkB Tgas (r)\n\u03bcmp\n\n(8)\n\nto provide the following equation from which the ICM\ntemperature as a function of radius Tgas (r) can be derived\nonce the gas number density as a function of radius ngas (r)\nis known:\n\nMDyn (r) = \u2212\ndTgas (r)\n+\ndr\n\n\u001b\n\n\u001a\nkB 2\nd ln[ngas (r)]\nr Tgas (r)\n+\n\u03bcmp G\ndr\n(9)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, kB is the Boltzman\nconstant, \u03bc is the plasma molecular weight (we assume\n\n\u03bc = 0.6 for the ICM) and mp the proton mass. The electron number density and the gas mass density are related\nby ngas (r) = \u03c1gas (r)/(1.14 mp ). The gas temperature profile can be obtained as a function of \u03ba and \u03b1 by replacing\nEqs. (6) and (2) into Eq. (9), and performing a GaussLaguerre integration of the latter. The solution is of the\nform:\n\u0010 w \u0011 \u0010 r \u0011p r \u03bd\nT (r, \u03ba, \u03b1) =\n(10)\ne( a ) t(r, \u03ba, \u03b1)\n\u03bda\na\n\u0010 3\u0011\n3\n\u03bcm\nwhere w \u2261 4\u03c0 G kBp \u03c10\u03bda = 1.54 \u00d7 1038 \u03c10\u03bda\nm keV,\nand\n\u0015\nZ \u221e \u001a \u0014\n3 \u2212 (p + \u03b1)\n\u03ba\u03b3\n,\nx\n+\nt(r, \u03ba, \u03b1) =\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n( ar )\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n(p+\u03bd+1)\n3\u2212p\n(11)\n+\u03b3\n, x x\u2212 \u03bd e\u2212x dx\n\u03bd\nEq. (10) will be used together with a model for the hot\nplasma spectrum to derive the best set of values for \u03ba and\n\u03b1, in agreement with quantities already observed in clusters of galaxies such as their mean X-ray temperature and\nluminosity and their baryonic mass fraction (see Sect. 5).\n\n3.4. Potential energy and specific entropy\nChanging the upper limit of the integral in Eq. (6) to \u221e\nwe obtain the total dynamical mass:\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n3 \u2212 (p + \u03b1)\n3\u2212p\n4\u03c0\u03c10 a3\n\u03ba\u0393\n+\u0393\n(12)\nMDyn =\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nThe total potential energy of the cluster is given by:\nUpot = G\n\n2\nMDyn\nRg\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the gravitational radius Rg is defined by Rg = aRg\u2217 ,\nwhere a is the scale parameter and Rg\u2217 is a dimensionless\nradius given by the numerical approximation:\nln(Rg\u2217 ) \u2243\n\n0.82032 \u2212 0.92446 ln(\u03bd)\n+ 0.84543\n\u03bd\n\n(M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001).\nIn spite of the X-ray emission, which is responsible in\nmany cases for cooling flow processes affecting the equilibrium state of the cluster in the inner regions, we may\nconsider clusters as structures where dissipating processes\nare negligible compared to their gravitational energy, thus\nsettling into a nearly thermodynamic equilibrium at large\nscale. This can be inferred by a simple order of magnitude calculation: the potential energy of a cluster of mass\n\u223c 1015 M\u2299 and radius \u223c 1 Mpc is about 8 \u00d7 1064 ergs.\nThe energy lost through X-ray emission during a Hubble\ntime (\u223c 2\u00d71017 s) by a cluster of X-ray luminosity \u223c 1045\nerg s\u22121 is around 3\u00d71062 ergs, a value which is almost 300\ntimes smaller than its potential energy. We can therefore\nestimate the gas entropy of such a configuration.\n\n\fR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\nThe specific entropy of the intra-cluster gas can be\ncomputed from the distribution function in the phase\nspace, f (x, v), of the gas particles using the microscopic\nBoltzmann-Gibbs definition:\nR\nf ln(f ) d3 x d3 v\n(14)\ns=\u2212 R\nf d3 x d3 v\n\nwhere the Boltzmann constant is kB = 1. Note that this\nexpresion gives us the specific entropy of the entire system\n(gas or DM) because the integration covers the total volume in phase space. This definition then corresponds to\nan integrated specific entropy, and it will be referred to as\n'global' specific entropy. It is important to say that when\nwe use the words 'integrated' or 'global' for the specific\nentropy, we are referring to this definition applied to the\ngas or DM separately and not to the sum of these two\ncomponents.\nTo find the distribution function some simplifying hypotheses are needed. The first one is that our system is\nspherically symmetric, and the second one is that the velocity dispersion of the gas particles is isotropic (we neglect any possible rotation of the gas). Thus the distribution function f , depending explicitly only on the total\nenergy, can be obtained from the density profile by an\nAbel inversion (Binney & Tremaine 1987). In this way,\nf = f (\u03c1) and the integrated specific entropy can be computed numerically as a function of the S\u00e9rsic parameters\nonly, providing a way to estimate the integrated specific\nentropy of the ICM from its surface brightness fit. It is\nimportant to emphasize here that the Boltzmann-Gibbs\ndefinition of the specific entropy makes no assumption on\nthe equation of state, in particular the ideal gas equation\nfor the ICM, and no assumption either on the validity of\na hydrostatic equilibrium state of the system; this definition is therefore a general one since it only assumes spherical symmetry and an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor.\nSince the method we present here, based on the cluster Xray surface brightness fitting, provides a good constrain\non the gas density profile, this density profile, together\nwith Eq. (14) can be used to obtain a good estimate of\nthe global ICM specific entropy.\nThe specific entropy can also be obtained from the\nfollowing set of equations (Balogh, Babul & Patton 1999):\n\u001a \u0014\n\u001b\n\u0015\n2\u03c0(\u03bcmp )8/3 K0 (r)\n5\ns(r) = cv ln\n+\nh2\n3\n\n(15)\n\nand\nK0 (r) =\n\nkB Tgas (r)\n\u03bcmp \u03c1gas (r)2/3\n\n(16)\n\nwhere cv is the specific heat capacity at constant volume\nof the plasma. These widely used equations require, however, the following assumptions on the ICM : the gas is\nconsidered to be monoatomic and the equation of state\nfor an ideal gas is supposed to hold. By knowing the ICM\ndensity and temperature distributions, Eqs. (15) and (16)\n\n5\n\ncan then be used (see Sect. 6.3) to compute the gas specific entropy profile for each cluster. Gas density profiles\nare obtained from the X-ray surface brightness fit (see\nSect. 4) while temperature profiles are derived by assuming both the hydrostatic equilibrium condition and the\nideal gas state equation for the ICM, as explained before.\nSince the physical quantities involved here are intensive,\nthese equations cannot be integrated to derive the integrated specific entropy of the gas, and Eq. (14) will have\nto be used for this purpose.\nThe entropy is of fundamental importance to understand the effects of non-gravitational processes on the\nthermodynamical history of clusters. Previous studies refer to the gas entropy at 0.1rvir , where rvir is the cluster virial radius (e.g. Ponman, Cannon & Navarro, 1999;\nLloyd-Davies, Ponman & Cannon 2000), while in this work\nwe estimate the gas specific entropy for the entire cluster. Our calculations take into account all possible sources\nof heating and cooling, regardless of the distance to the\ncentre, thus providing a good quantitative basis to which\nmodels can be compared in order to disentangle the different processes that affect the internal energy of the ICM\nduring its history since the earlier epochs of the cluster\nformation.\nWe also notice that our assumption concerning the\n\u03c1DM /\u03c1gas ratio (Eq. (5)) implies that the resulting DM\ndensity distribution is also S\u00e9rsic-like, with a central density distribution described by a power law varying as\nr\u2212(p+\u03b1) . Under the hypothesis already stated concerning\nthe distribution function of particles in phase space, we\ncan in principle also compute the integrated specific entropy of the DM halo by using Eq. (14) and the DM density profile. Therefore the DM specific entropy is calculated numerically from the equation:\nZ \u03a8(0)\n1\ndM\ns=\u2212\nlnf (\u01eb)d\u01eb ,\n(17)\nM 0\nd\u01eb\nwhich can be derived from Eq. (14), and where \u01eb represents\nthe binding energy, M the total halo mass, and \u03a8 the\nrelative gravitational potential (see Magnard 2002).\n\n4. Fitting method and density profile\nFinding the gas density profile amounts to deriving the\nbest set of values for the S\u00e9rsic parameters. This has\nrequired to fit the ROSAT images by a pixel-to-pixel\nmethod, which creates a three-dimensional model of the\nX-ray emission which is then projected by integration\nalong the line of sight, taking into account the energy response and the point spread function of the detector. The\nresult is a synthetical image which can be compared to the\nobservation, and the best set of S\u00e9rsic parameters is obtained by successive iterations. The gas density profile defined by Eq. (2) is used to model the bremsstrahlung emission, and the free-bound and bound-bound X-ray emissions are taken into account. The code computes the Xray emissivity \u01eb\u03bd in every point; it is then projected to obtain the surface brightness. This projected image is then\n\n\f6\n\nR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\nconvolved with the ROSAT point spread function (PSF),\nwhich varies as a function of position (and energy) on the\ndetector. We have used in our fits a FWHM of 2 pixels\nwhich corresponds to the central PSPC PSF.\nThe cluster redshift and the mean gas temperature are\nrequired as input parameters. To obtain an initial guess for\nthe free parameters in Eq. (2) we fit a S\u00e9rsic profile (Eq.\n(1)) to the X-ray surface brightness of each cluster. In order to stay as close as possible to our hypothesis of spherical symmetry, we selected clusters presenting the most\nround and uniform projected X-ray emission. However,\nthis emission is not perfectly circular and due also to the\nfact that what we observe is always a projection on the\nplane of the sky of a three dimensional structure, we decided to take into account during the fitting process the\nellipticity of the projected emission supposing also that\nall the clusters are oblate spheroids, i.e., that the third\naxis along the line of sight is a major axis. If a is the\nsemi\u2013major axis, which also corresponds to the scale parameter in the S\u00e9rsic profile, and b is the semi\u2013minor axis,\nwe define\np the ellipticity of the projected X-ray emission\nby e = 1 \u2212 (b/a)2 . The ellipticity and semi-major axis\nposition angle of the X-ray distribution are thus considered as free parameters for the fit and given as inputs for\nthe code. The gas was assumed to be isothermal as a first\napproximation.\n\nAfter obtaining the initial guesses for each free parameter, we use these values together with Eq. (2) to make\na new synthetic image, then compare it to the actual\nROSAT image. The parameter values are then changed\nand the comparison process is repeated iteratively, until\nit finds the 3D X-ray emission which best fits the surface\nbrightness profile of the observation when projected. The\nfitting process is carried out with the MIGRAD method in\nthe CERN MINUIT library (James 1994). In this process,\nthe gas temperature is kept constant, as a first approximation. The exact shape of the temperature profile is not\ncrucial when finding the set of values for the parameters,\nbecause the emissivity does not have a strong dependence\non temperature as compared to its dependence on density; indeed, we find that modifying the temperature profile changes the values of the S\u00e9rsic parameters by at most\na few percent, as explained in Sect. 5.\nThe fitting process directly gives us the best estimates\nfor the semimajor axis a and shape parameter \u03bd. However,\nthe central electronic number density ne0 given by the fit is\nnot accurate enough, and is estimated by another method\n(see Sect. 5).\nWe evaluated errors with the MINUIT error function\nMINOS, which calculates parameter errors taking into\naccount both parameter correlations and non-linearities.\nResulting errors correspond to a 1\u03c3 deviation.\nAll the equations presented in Sect. 3 refer to spherical symmetry, for which we had to define an equivalent\nscale parameter, aeq in order to go from the oblate geometry considered in the fit to the spherical geometry of the\nmodel. This new scale is defined as aeq = (a2 b)1/3 and will\nbe used instead of a to compute the specific entropy, the\ndynamical mass and the potential energy of a spherically\nsymmetric X-ray region.\nWe show in Fig. 1 a comparison of our best fit S\u00e9rsic\nmodel of A2597. The good fit of the cluster surface brightness can clearly be seen, confirming the capability of the\nS\u00e9rsic profile to reproduce the cluster X-ray emission.\n\n5. Gas temperature and dark matter to gas ratio\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of our best model of the X-ray surface brightness (dot-dashed ellipses) with the corresponding ROSAT image for the cluster A2597. The X-ray isocontours are 0.5, 1, 3, 10 and 100 times the background;\nthey were made after smoothing the original image with\na gaussian kernel of \u03c3 = 3.2 pixels.\n\nThe fitting process described above provides the best\nvalues of aeq and \u03bd for a given gas temperature profile, assuming as a first approximation that each cluster has an isothermal ICM, and then obtaining, through\nan iterative procedure, the best compatible gas density\nand non-isothermal temperature profiles, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry.\nIn order for the ne0 normalization to give the observed\nnumber of counts, we first computed the cluster flux F ,\nafter substraction of point sources and background (obtained by the 2D fit). The masked source pixel counts\nwere set to the mean value taken within ellipses. Then\nne0 was chosen so that a bremsstrahlung XSPEC model\nconvolved by a hydrogen column absorption would give\nthe same flux as seen by ROSAT:\n\n\fR.

(10) and (11) provide the ICM temperature profiles as families of solutions depending on the parameters\n\u03ba and \u03b1. Since these are found to be different from those\nassumed to estimate the S\u00e9rsic parameters, the fitting process must be repeated, using the new temperature profile,\nin order to obtain a new set of parameters for each cluster,\nuntil convergence.\nWe tested on one cluster (A2029) the effect of a temperature gradient on the gas density profile from distances\nclose to ref f /4 outwards, where ref f corresponds to an effective radius which contains half of the cluster gas mass\n(see Table 2). For this, we did a second fit of the surface brightness of A2029 using a new temperature profile\ngiven by a power law of the form T (r) = T0 (r/ref f )\u03b2\nwhere ref f \u2243 2800 kpc. T0 was set in order to have a\nnon-weighted mean temperature equal to the mean cluster temperature (Table 1) and we considered the cases\n\u03b2 = \u22120.5 and \u22121. After the first iteration, the values\nfound for ne 0 , aeq , and \u03bd remained almost unchanged for\nboth values of \u03b2: the scale and shape parameters changed\nby about 1%, and the central electronic density by 4%\nwith respect to the isothermal fit.\nWe therefore decided to keep the S\u00e9rsic values given\nby the original fit as the definitive ones. Eq. (10) can be\nre-written in the form T (r, \u03ba, \u03b1) = \u03baT1 (r, \u03b1) + T2 (r). We\nproduced a set of T1 (r, \u03b1) profiles corresponding to values of \u03b1 between 0 and 2 with steps of \u2206\u03b1 = 0.1. These\ncurves together with their corresponding T2 (r) profiles and\nan adequate set of values for \u03ba were used to find which\ncombination of \u03ba and \u03b1 gives the closest values to the observed global temperatures and luminosities (Ebeling et\nal. 1996; Wu, Xue & Fang 1999), and baryon mass fractions (Arnaud & Evrard 1999; Mohr, Mathiesen & Evrard\n1999; Schindler 1999). These quantities are evaluated as\nfollows. The two profiles ne (r) and T (r, \u03ba, \u03b1) plus the hypothesis of a gas metallicity equal to 0.3 Z\u2299 (see Renzini\n1997) and the emission process determine the cluster Xray emission. We used the XSPEC software to simulate\nthe corresponding spectra with a bremsstrahlung emission\nmodel (to be coherent with the emission model used in the\nfitting program). We summed up the spectra from shells of\nconstant electronic density and temperature over radius,\nconsidering only the volume intersected by the ROSAT\nobservation cylinder. The spectrum obtained is then convolved with a photoelectric absorption model and with the\nROSAT response function to produce the simulated spectrum. A fit is then performed on this spectrum to derive\nthe X-ray temperature and luminosity (the metallicity and\nhydrogen column density are fixed).\n\n7\n\nThe set of \u03ba and \u03b1 has to produce LX and T in agreement with the observed data within errors. Moreover, the\ngas mass fractions should stay inside the observed limits.\nSo we performed a minimization of the distance between\nthe observed data and the predictions from our model. We\nfound that the best \u03b1 is often very close to zero, which is\nnot in good agreement with results obtained from numerical simulations by Teyssier (2002) which show a \u03c1DM /\u03c1g\nratio varying globally as r\u22120.25 ; besides our values of \u03b1\nare not well constrained. We therefore chose to impose\n\u03b1 = \u22120.25; \u03ba was then recomputed to give luminosities\nand temperatures as close as possible to the observations.\nTo each temperature profile T (r, \u03ba, \u03b1) corresponds a\ncouple of simulated observational parameters (Tsim , Lsim ).\nThe value of \u03ba is constrained by imposing these parameters to be close (within error bars) to the real observational\nvalues. The gas mass fraction is checked to be compatible\nwith the isothermal hypothesis.\n\n6. Results\n6.1. Mass distributions and parameter correlations\nThe 3D gas density profiles were computed with Eq. (2)\nfor all the clusters in our sample, using the sets of parameters obtained from the surface brightness fitting process\n(described in Sect. 4) of the PSPC images and listed in\nTable 2. By means of Eq. (5), the corresponding DM distribution can be recovered. In Fig. 2 we show the 3D gas and\nDM density profiles for every cluster divided by the critical\ndensity of the Universe at the cluster redshift (e.g., Ettori,\nDe Grandi & Molendi 2002): \u03c1c (z) = 3H 2 (z)/(8\u03c0G),\nwhere the p\nHubble constant at redshift z is defined by\nH(z) = H0 \u03a9m (1 + z)3 + 1 \u2212 \u03a9m .\n\nBoth DM and gas distributions are S\u00e9rsic-like, implying that the corresponding profiles decrease exponentially\noutwards above a certain distance from the cluster centre; on the other hand, when r goes to zero they follow\na power law in radius with a logarithmic slope tending\nasymptotically to \u2212p(\u03bd) for the gas and to \u2212(p(\u03bd) + \u03b1)\nfor the DM.\nThe values for \u03ba, obtained as described in Sect. 5, are\nin most cases smaller than 10, while the value for \u03b1 was\nfixed to 0.25 (see above). Although DM halos are denser\nthan the ICM gas, as implied by the \u03ba factor and the\nasymptotic slope difference \u03b1, the general shapes of both\nprofiles look quite similar, implying that dark matter and\ngas are distributed in a comparable way. This effect is a\nnatural consequence of the hypotheses and conditions imposed to our model. However such a behaviour seems to\nbe the case for massive systems (like those in our sample see total masses in Table 3), as shown by observations of\ngalaxy clusters at moderate and high redshifts (Schindler\n1999). The gas would be accreted into the forming structure and once the system reaches a relaxed state, the gas\n\n\f8\n\nR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\nThis configuration would be the result of non-spherically\nsymmetric formation processes through hierarchical merging. Mass shells are continously mixed and the density\nprofiles tend to be shallower than the NFW profile at the\ncenter, converging to the \u03c1 \u221d r\u22120.75 distribution for maximal mixing (Taylor & Navarro 2001).\nOne important advantage of the S\u00e9rsic density profile\nis that its volume integral converges when integrated up\nto infinity, making it thus possible to determine the total\ncluster mass, and the potential energy and entropy of the\nsystem without introducing a cutoff radius, in contrast to\nthe popular \u03b2-model, for instance. Total dynamical masses\ncan thus be computed (see Eq. (12)) and the resulting\nvalues for all clusters are given in Table 3.\n\nFig. 2. 3D deprojected gas (full lines) and dark matter\n(dashed lines) density profiles divided by the critical density of the Universe at the cluster redshift.\n\njust accommodates into the halo potential. This is true\nat the scale of massive galaxy clusters where the potential well is deep enough to prevent the gas from expansion\ndue to non-gravothermal processes. In this case, both dark\nmatter and gas present similar distributions in contrast\nwith what is observed in smaller systems such as groups\nof galaxies and even galaxies, where the gas can produce\nextended cores as result of energy injection due to supernova explosions or shock winds (Bryan 2000, Bower et al.\n2001, Brighenti & Mathews 2001). It is also important to\nmention that Eq. (5), based on galaxy cluster observations, may no longer be valid for low mass systems such\nas groups of galaxies, in which case our DM model would\nbe inappropriate to describe groups.\nThe averaged gas density profile for our set of 24 galaxy\nclusters is well fit by a S\u00e9rsic profile with parameters:\n\u03c10 = 7.4\u00d710\u221224 kg m\u22123 , aeq = 367 kpc and \u03bd = 0.56. The\nlatter gives p(\u03bd) = 0.67 which makes the corresponding\nDM density profile vary as r\u22120.92 when r goes to zero. This\ncentral slope for the DM halo is shallower than the selfsimilar solution for spherical collapse in an expanding universe found by Bertschinger (1985) (\u03c1 \u221d r\u22122.25 ), than the\nasymptotic behaviour found by Moore et al. (1999) in their\nnumerical simulations (\u03c1 \u221d r\u22121.5 ) and than the NFW\n(Navarro, Frenk & White, 1996, 1997) universal density\nprofile. However it is steeper than the \u03c1 \u221d r\u22120.75 critical\nsolution found by Taylor & Navarro (2001) for galaxysized CDM halos based on the study of their phase-space\ndensity distribution. This critical solution can be interpreted as a maximally \"mixed\" configuration, where the\nphase-space distribution across the system is the most uniform one compatible with a monotonically decreasing density profile and with the power-law entropy distribution.\n\nFig. 3. Synthetic cumulative dynamical mass profiles normalized to the corresponding total integrated cluster mass\nMDyn . The radial coordinate is normalized to the cluster\nr200 radius.\n\nFig. 3 shows the resulting cumulative dynamical mass\nprofiles for every cluster as obtained by means of Eq. (6)\nwith the corresponding S\u00e9rsic parameters. Every profile\nhas been normalized to the corresponding cluster total\nmass, Mdyn (see Eq. (12)), and the radial coordinate has\nbeen normalized to the corresponding cluster r200 radius,\nwhich is defined as the radius within which the mean density is 200 times the critical density of the universe, \u03c1c , as\ndefined above. In general, we can define a radius r\u2206 within\nwhich the mean density is \u2206 times \u03c1c and r\u2206 can be ob3\ntained from the relation M (r < r\u2206 )/(4\u03c0r\u2206\n/3) = \u2206\u03c1c ).\nThe averaged cumulative dynamical mass distributions\nshow a logarithmic slope dlogM/dlogr \u223c 1 at r \u223c 0.7r200 .\nFurther out this slope decreases rather fast. According\nto our model, the cumulative mass profiles converge only\naround r \u223c 10r200 , but the mass variation is only of a\n\n\fR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\nfactor of two, going from M \u223c 1015 M\u2299 at \u223c r200 to\nM \u223c 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 at \u223c 10r200 .\nThe analysis by Ettori, De Grandi & Molendi (2002)\nof BeppoSAX data includes some clusters of our sample.\nThey estimate masses for \u2206 = 1000 and 2500, by using\neither a NFW or a King profile for the total mass distribution. Comparing our results with theirs for same clusters, we see that our mass estimates, derived from the\nS\u00e9rsic profile for these two values of \u2206 within same r\u2206\nradii as indicated in their Table 2 are in quite good agreement. In most cases, our masses differ by about 10% or\nless, with differences reaching about 20% for a few cases.\nThese differences are likely to be due to the use of different functional forms (the S\u00e9rsic, NFW and King models)\nto describe the mass profile. Moreover, from our sample\nwe find in average r200 \u223c 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 Mpc (see Table 2).\nThese values are about 78% of those found in numerical\nsimulations by Navarro, Frenk & White 1996 for cluster\nsized systems of comparable masses. Moreover, we note\nthat the values of our scale parameter aeq are comparable to those of the scale radius rs of the NFW profile\nfor similar mass ranges. In this way, we obtain in average aeq /r200 \u223c 0.12 in good agreement with the value of\nrs /r200 \u223c 0.14 (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996), the difference being of only 14%. We can therefore say that the\nS\u00e9rsic profile is able to describe the mass distribution in\nclusters in as much the same way as other models as the\nNFW and King models, the differences being due to the\nmathematical natures of the models.\nBased on a de-projected S\u00e9rsic model for the gas density profile, the best set of values of ne0 , aeq and \u03bd for\neach cluster is given in Table 2. These three parameters\nare displayed two by two in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. A clear correlation between the shape (\u03bd) and scale (aeq ) parameters is\nseen, while the correlations we find for \u03a30 \u2212 \u03bd and \u03a30 \u2212 aeq\n(\u03a30 being obtained from \u03c10 by using Eq. (4)), are clear but\nshow a somewhat larger scatter. Note that these three correlations have shapes similar to those found in elliptical\ngalaxies. This may indicate, as for ellipticals, the existence\nof an entropic line on which galaxy clusters lie, in which\ncase the correlation shown in Fig. 4 may just be the projection of this isentropic relation on the log(\u03bd) \u2212 log(aeq )\nplane. In the case of elliptical galaxies, this entropic line\nwas interpreted as the intersection of two surfaces in the\n[log \u03a30 , log a, log \u03bd] space : the Entropic surface and the\nEnergy-Mass surface (M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001). In this work,\nwe find that these two surfaces exist for our galaxy clusters as well, and these clusters are also located on a line\ncorresponding to the intersections of the two surfaces (see\nSect. 6.5). A complete discussion on this point will be presented in a forecoming paper (Magnard, in preparation).\nIt is worth noting that, although from the mathematical\npoint of view no correlation between the model parameters is expected, the fact that we observe such correlations\nprobably indicates that they are due to the physics underlying the X-ray emission distribution.\n\n9\n\nFig. 4.

Temperature profiles\nWe show in Fig. 7 the 3D non-weighted temperature profile for every cluster in our sample, calculated with the\nparameters given in Table 2 and normalized to the corresponding median temperature from the literature (see\nTable 1). As for the total mass profiles, the radial coordinate has been normalized to the corresponding cluster\nvirial radius. All the profiles are very similar: they slightly\nincrease from the center, then remain approximately constant to finally decrease at large radii. The mean temperature profile is consistent with an almost isothermal\ndistribution for radii smaller than 0.25r200 (\u223c 625 kpc),\nin agreement with other works (Allen, Schmidt & Fabian\n2001; De Grandi & Molendi 2002), followed by a rapid\ndecrease for radii larger than 0.25r200 , with a logarithmic\nslope of the order of \u22120.6 for radii around 0.63 r200 . This\ndecrease results to be quite similar to the slope of \u22120.64\nfound by De Grandi & Molendi (2002) at radii larger than\n\u223c 750 kpc for their mean temperature profile, taking into\naccount the cooling and non-cooling flow clusters of their\nsample. The results of Markevitch et al. (1998) based on\nASCA observations show similar trends for the temperature distribution. The characteristic central drop we obtain in our temperature profiles is due to the mathematical\nproperties of the density profile rather than to a real physical effect, but the lack of resolution of the PSPC impedes\nfrom properly addressing this issue, and we cannot tell\nanything about the temperature distribution within the\ncentral cooling flow region.\n\nIn Fig. 8 we show the re-projected emission weighted\ntemperature profile for every cluster, defined by :\nR 2\nn (r)T (r)dz\n(18)\nTew (R) = Re 2\nne (r)dz\n\nThe LX \u2212 TX relation derived from our calculations is\nshown in Fig. 9.

This shift is\nprobably due to the fact that we include the central region\nin our luminosity evaluation, while Markevitch excises it.\n\n6.3. ICM and DM specific entropies\nThe global specific entropy sgas of the ICM is given in\nTable 3. It is found to vary very little from one cluster\nto another, as for the specific entropy of stars in elliptical galaxies (M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001 and references therein).\n\nFig. 7. Synthetic 3 D temperature profiles calculated from\nEqs. (10) and (11) with the values of \u03b1 and \u03ba given in\nTable 2. The temperature is normalized to the global cluster temperature and the radial coordinate is normalized\nto the cluster r200 radius.\n\nFig. 9. Relation between LX and TX . The point at the\nlower left corner corresponds to the group HCG 62. The\nsolid line shows the best fit (see text) and the dotted line\nis the fit found by Markevitch (1998).\n\nThis is, however, a first order behavior. Numerical simulations of elliptical galaxies formed in a hierarchical merging scheme, show that their specific entropy varies a little\nwith mass, most probably due to merging processes (Lima\nNeto et al. 1999, M\u00e1rquez et al. 2000). The situation is not\ndifferent in galaxy clusters. We show in Fig. 10 that the\nglobal specific entropy of the ICM and the gas mass are\nindeed clearly correlated, although this is a second order\neffect (about 2%), small compared to the dominant relation sgas \u223c constant that we observe. The difference with\nelliptical galaxies is that the slope in Fig. 10 is steeper\nthan for ellipticals: if we write sgas = s0 + \u03b2 ln(Mgas ),\nour best fit to the data gives \u03b2 = 1.86 \u00b1 0.15 compared\nto \u03b2 \u2243 1 for ellipticals (with s0 constant). The error bars\ncorrespond to 1\u03c3 deviations and were computed from the\n\n\fR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\n11\n\nFig. 8.

Relation between the gas integrated specific entropy and the mean gas temperature taken from the literature (see text). The point at the lower left corner corresponds to the group HCG 62.\n\nparameter errors given by MINOS and by means of Monte\nCarlo simulations. Every parameter was modeled by a\ngaussian distribution with \u03c3 equal to the corresponding\n1\u03c3 deviation from MINOS. These distributions were then\nused to derive the total mass and specific entropy distributions and the corresponding 1\u03c3 errors for each cluster.\nFor the linear fit we used a linear least-squares approximation in one dimension, taking into account the error\nbars in both directions at the same time. A comparable\nrelation is found between the integrated specific entropy\nsgas of the ICM and the dynamical mass of the cluster,\nwith a somewhat steeper slope of 2.67 \u00b1 0.12. In our fitting of the cluster X-ray surface brightness we have also\ntaken into account the cluster center, thus our estimation\nof the gas specific entropy necessarily takes into account\nthe effects of the central cooling flow. This information is\n\nintegrated together with the other non-gravitational thermal processes affecting the intra cluster gas.\nThe integrated specific entropy of the X-ray gas is displayed in Fig. 11 as a function of the observed isothermal\ngas temperature. The entropy appears to increase with\nthe temperature, consistently with a linear increase (the\nbest fit to our data is shown in Fig. 11 and corresponds\nto sgas \u221d T 4.92 ). However, the dispersion is too large to\nassert a linear dependency. Note that such a relation has\nalready been observed by Ponman et al. (1999) and LloydDavies et al. (2000), and predicted by gravitational simulations (Borgani et al. 2001, Muanwong et al. 2002). The\nonly group shown in this plot does not exhibit a significant\nentropy floor, but other groups need to be added. It would\nbe important to get a good evaluation of this entropy floor\nas it is a strong constraint on the non-gravitational energy\ninjection (Lloyd-Davies et al. 2000).\n\n\f12\n\nR.

The best fit line is indicated (see\ntext).\nFig. 12. K0 profiles based on density and temperature\nmodels.\n\nThe derived gas density and temperature profiles can\nbe used to compute the gas specific entropy profile for\neach cluster by using Eqs. (15) and (16).\nThe K0 (r) profiles are shown in Fig. 12, where the radial coordinate is normalized to the r200 radius. All these\nprofiles are consistent with a gas specific entropy increasing with radius, indicating that the gas has been heated by\nshock fronts at successive epochs when collapsing into the\ncluster potential well, before being virialized. Thus, the\nspecific entropy profile provides useful information about\nthe ICM thermal history. Some of the profiles present a\nclear steepening with radius at about 0.8 r200 , while others correspond to power laws throughout. The average of\nthe profiles defined by Eq. (16) has a logarithmic slope\ndlogK0 /dlogr \u223c 1 at about 0.6 r200 and it is in agreement with results obtained by Tozzi & Norman (2001)\nwho studied the effect of an entropy excess in the ICM\ngas before accretion into the DM halo. No entropy core is\npresent, perhaps due to the effect of central cooling, although this could also be due to the mathematical nature\nof the profiles derived from the S\u00e9rsic model. In general\nour profiles are in agreement with external heating models\nfor rich clusters (Tozzi, Scharf & Norman 2000; Tozzi &\nNorman 2001). However, we notice that the K0 (r) profiles\nobtained from our density and temperature distributions\nare about a factor of 7 larger than those inferred by Tozzi\n& Norman (2001). This is probably just due to a normalization effect related to the way the density and temperature are computed; it is mainly the entropy variations\nthat are a reliable physical quantity.\nThe assumed relation (5) between the dark matter and\ngas densities allows us to also compute the global dark\nmatter entropy (see Table 3) numerically from Eq. (17),\nwhich comes out directly from the definition given in\n\nFig. 14. Relation between the dynamical mass and the\npotential energy. The solid line corresponds to the best fit\nto the data and the dashed line is the theoretical slope of\nI = 5/3 defined by the relation ln(Upot ) \u2212 I ln(Mdyn) =\nconst.\n\nEq. (14). The corresponding entropy\u2013mass relation thus\nfound for the dark matter is very close to that obtained\nfor the gas, with \u03b2 \u2243 1.90 \u00b1 0.17 as seen in Fig. 13.\n\n6.4. Potential energy \u2013 mass relation\nThe relation between the dynamical mass and potential\nenergy, previously shown for elliptical galaxies (M\u00e1rquez\net al. 2001) and in numerical simulations (Lanzoni, 2000;\nJang-Condell & Hernquist, 2001), is displayed in Fig. 14\nfor our set of clusters. If we write it as ln(Upot ) \u2212\nI ln(Mdyn ) = const, the best fit to our data imply I =\n\n\fR. Demarco et al.: Dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters\n\n1.68 \u00b1 0.08, in excellent agreement with the theoretical\nvalue of 5/3. The error bars and linear fit are computed\nin the same way as explained in the previous section.\n\n6.5. Discussion\nThe correlations presented in the previous sections between the mass, potential energy and integrated specific\nentropy, confirm the existence of an entropic surface,\ns(\u03a30 , a, \u03bd) \u2212 \u03b2 ln(M (\u03a30 , a, \u03bd)) = const (see Eq. (14)),\nand a potential energy-mass surface, ln(Upot (\u03a30 , a, \u03bd)) \u2212\nI ln(Mdyn (\u03a30 , a, \u03bd)) = const, in the S\u00e9rsic parameters\nspace, remarkably similar to the case of elliptical galaxies\n(M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001). Indeed, we observe the clusters in\nour sample to be located at the intersection of these two\nsurfaces, indicating the existence of an \"entropic line\" for\ngalaxy clusters (see Magnard 2002). We have checked by\nsimulations that this line is also recovered for a random set\nof values of the S\u00e9rsic parameters, suggesting the possibility that this relation could be a consequence of the model\nassumed to describe the final viralized system (in our case\na S\u00e9rsic profile). However, the fact that a S\u00e9rsic profile\nreproduces very well the X-ray surface brightness of clusters, and hence the gas distribution of the ICM, supports\nthe idea that the physical processes operating during the\nformation and evolution of galaxy clusters, which are of\ncourse responsible for the final structure reached by the\nICM and DM halo, are indeed at the origin of the entropic\nline. To confirm this, the same method as in this work, but\nwith different models for the gas density profile should be\nused. Moreover, the existence of both an entropic surface\nand a potential energy-mass surface for galaxy clusters\nimplies that these objects can be considered as a singleparameter family, described by one of the S\u00e9rsic parameters only (e.g. M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001). Interestingly, analogous correlations have been obtained for galaxy clusters by\nFujita & Takahara (1999). The importance of the above\nmentioned correlations resides in the fact that they are\nprobably the result of the physics ruling cluster formation.\nA correlation between the global specific entropy and the\nmass conserves information on the various events affecting the thermodynamical history of clusters. The observed\nvariation of sgas with dynamical mass in clusters suggests\nthat dissipating processes in clusters play an important\nrole as generators of entropy. These mainly correspond to\nBremsstrahlung emission (L \u221d M 4/3 ) and cooling flows.\nMerging processes between clusters are of importance in\nsuch a relation, because of their impact on the final total\nmass and on the amount of entropy produced during the\ncluster formation. Violent merger events can be accompanied by an important dissipation of energy and creation\nof entropy, while minor mergers can be translated in an\nadiabatic accretion of matter without a significant production of entropy. These energy losses, however, are all\nnegligible compared to the cluster gravitational energy.\nThus the value of the slope \u03b2 in the specific entropy-mass\nrelation reflects the impact of such processes on the clus-\n\n13\n\nter history. Clusters with higher global specific entropy\ncould have undergone more episodes of hierarchical merging through their histories, thus becoming more massive.\nOn the other hand, considering the collapse of matter\nto form a virialized gravitational system, the correlation\nbetween the potential energy and the total mass of the\nfinal structure is a natural consequence of the conservation\nof energy and mass during its formation. A self-similar\nrelation defined by U \u221d M 5/3 is expected from theory\n(see M\u00e1rquez et al. 2001) and we show that it is indeed\nalso followed by our observed galaxy clusters.\nAll these results strongly suggest that the formation\nprocesses affecting galaxies and clusters of galaxies are\nquite similar regardless the scale involved.\n\n7. Conclusions\nWe have shown in the present work that the S\u00e9rsic profile\ncan be used as a good tracer of the matter distribution\nin clusters, under the assumption that clusters are well\nrelaxed structures, as it was the case in elliptical galaxies.\nIts mathematical properties make it an interesting and\nuseful tool that can be employed to explore the physics\nof relaxed systems, although any other appropriate profile\ncan be used. The density profiles obtained here reproduce\nwell the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the ROSAT\nPSPC images. The asymptotic behaviour of these profiles towards the cluster center turns out to be shallower\nthan the NFW profile, but still within the limits predicted\nby numerical simulations concerning the central slope of\ngalaxy-sized DM halos. Temperature profiles derived here\n(considering the hydrostatical equilibrium hypothesis for\nthe cluster structure) are in agreement with other works.\nWe estimate the integrated specific entropy content for\ngalaxy clusters and our specific entropy profiles are consistent with the predicted shape of the entropy distribution\nfor massive clusters, obtained by simulations which take\ninto account pre-heating and cooling processes.\nWe have shown that both for the gas and for the dark\nmatter the integrated specific entropy and the potential\nenergy have behaviors comparable to those observed for\nstars in elliptical galaxies: the integrated specific entropy is\nconstant to first order and in reality increases slightly with\nmass as a logarithmic function, while the potential energy\nscales with mass as a power law. Note that the index of\nthis power law is close to the theoretical value of 5/3 for elliptical galaxies and clusters. This strongly suggests that\nall these self gravitating systems behave similarly, even\nthough they may have very different masses and thermodynamical histories. Elliptical galaxies could then be considered as scaled down versions of galaxy clusters (Moore\net al. 1999). Moreover, integrated specific entropy-mass\nand potential energy-mass correlations should be the result of the formation history of the clusters. Heating mechanisms and merger events play an important role here and\ntotal mass and energy are conserved during the whole formation process of the final virialized structure.\n\n\f14\n\nR.

The\nuse of Chandra and XMM-Newton data will be crucial in\nthese kinds of studies due to their higher resolution and\nsensitivity compared to ROSAT. We also note that a similar analysis could be carried out in samples of synthetic\nclusters derived from numerical simulations.\nAcknowledgements.
