If a set of\nqubits can be maintained in a coherent, controllable many-body state, certain very difficult computational problems\nbecome tractable. In particular, successful QC would mean a revolution in the areas of cryptography1 and data-base\nsearching2. In addition, it would mean a great advance in general technical capabilities, since the control of individual\nquantum systems and their interactions would represent a new era in nanotechnology.\nHowever, from a practical point of view, a dilemma presents itself immediately. On the one hand, one wishes to\ncontrol quantum degrees of freedom using external influences, since that is how a quantum algorithm is implemented,\nand to measure them, since that is the output step. On the other hand, the system must be isolated from the\nenvironment, since random perturbations will destroy the quantum coherence that is the whole advantage of QC.\nThis is the isolation-control dilemma, and it leads to a very rough figure-of-merit F for any quantum computer. If\nwe define the decoherence time \u03c4 as the time it takes to lose quantum coherence, and the clock speed s (roughly the\ninverse of the time to run a logic gate), then the figure of merit is F = s\u03c4 and a practical machine should satisfy\nF > 104 \u2212 105 at least. If the clock speed is limited only by standard electronics, then we may be able to achieve\ns \u2248 109 Hz. This would imply that \u03c4 = 1 ms is a lower limit for the decoherence time.\nThe dilemma has not yet been solved, though a number of solutions have been proposed. A particularly attractive\nsolution is to use spin degrees of freedom as qubits. Nuclear spins interact relatively weakly with their environment\nbecause the coupling, proportional to the magnetic moment, is small. Yet there has grown up a sophisticated\ntechnology (NMR) for the manipulation of the spins, and some rudimentary computations have been performed3 .\nReadout is the main difficulty with this approach, since the field created by a single moment is tiny, and pure states\ncannot be achieved in the macroscopic samples used.\nElectron spins also interact weakly with the environment in some circumstances: relaxation times in excess of 103 s\nhave been measured for donor bound states of phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P)4 . The corresponding manipulation\ntechnology (ESR) has also reached a high level of sophistication, but the magnetic moment of the electron exceeds\nthat of the nucleus by 3 orders of magnitude, which presents problems of isolation. Readout should be easier than\nfor nuclei, since detection of single electron charges is certainly possible5 , and spin-dependent detection is not far out\nof the reach of current technology.\nSolid-state implementations of QC are particularly attractive because of the possibility of using existing computer\ntechnology to scale small numbers of qubits up to the 105 or so that would be needed for nontrivial computations.\nThe first paper to propose using the electron spin in a quantum dot subjected to a strong DC magnetic field was that\nof Loss and DiVincenzo6 . Kane7 proposed employing the nuclear spin in the Si:P system as the qubit. A specific\nstructure consisting of silicon-germanium (SiGe) layers was proposed by Vrijen et al.8 . This structure incorporates the\nidea that the g-factor of an electron can be changed by moving it in a Ge concentration gradient, allowing individual\nelectron to be addressed by the external AC field. A different SiGe structure has been proposed by Friesen et al.9 .\nThis structure is designed so that the electron number on the dots, and the coupling between the dots, can be carefully\n\n\f2\ncontrolled.\nSolid-state implementations must also face the isolation-control dilemma. Decoherence times must exceed the 1 ms\nnumber in the actual physical structures that are needed for the operation of quantum algorithms. In this paper,\nwe examine whether this can be the case for some of the existing proposals based on electron-spin qubits. In the\nprocess, we hope to learn something about modifications to these structures that can increase \u03c4 . We shall focus on\nlow temperature operation, since, as we shall see, this will probably be necessary in order to obtain sufficiently large\n\u03c4.\nWe can build on a large body of work, both theoretical and experimental, from the 1950's and 1960's on ESR in\ndoped semiconductors. In a series of papers, Feher and collaborators4 investigated the relaxation time for the spin\nof electrons bound on donor sites in lightly doped Si. At sufficiently low temperatures, the relaxation time T1 is\ndominated by single-phonon emission and absorption. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), this can relax\nthe spin, causing decoherence. The theory was worked out by Hasegawa10 and Roth11 .\nIt must of course be recognized that this spin-lattice relaxation time is not necessarily to be identified with the\ndecoherence time. The decoherence time is the shortest time for any process to permanently erase the phase\ninformation in the wavefunction. This may mean the phase for a single spin, but it also means that the relative\nphases of the wavefunctions of different spins must also be preserved, so that processes that cause mutual decoherence\nmust also be taken into account. The actual decoherence time is the minimum of all of these times. A spin relaxation\ntime in excess of 1 ms is a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for the viability of a solid-state electron-spin QC\nproposal.\nA QC must have precise input as well as an accurate algorithm. Preparation of the spin state is often proposed\nto be done by thermalization of the spin system at a low temperature. The time to do this actually sets an upper\nlimit on the relaxation time of whatever processes thermalize the spins to the lattice. A limit of perhaps 1 \u2212 10 s is\na reasonable requirement.\nThis paper focuses on T1 , the time for relaxation of the longitudinal component of the magnetization, by spin-phonon\ninteractions. These processes cause real spin-flip transitions. They occur at random times and thus indubitably\ncause decoherence. In addition to these processes characterized fully by T1 , there are processes which introduce\nrandom phase changes in the spin wavefunctions. To characterize all such processes by a single \"dephasing time\"\nT2 will usually not be sufficient for understanding the operation of a multi-qubit system12 . Difficulties of definition\narise, and care must be taken to specify which phase is involved and to what extent it is randomized. For a single\nspin system there is no ambiguity. The 2 \u00d7 2 density matrix \u03c1ij for the qubit with cylindrical symmetry involves\nonly 2 independent parameters \u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 , and \u03c112 . The time dependence of \u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 after a system preparation is\nexponential with decay constant T1 and represents the return of the longitudinal component of the magnetization\nto its equilibrium value. The decay is due to inelastic transitions of the type calculated in this paper. \u03c112 on the\nother hand, is nonzero only if the preparation of the spin state has a transverse component: Sx (t = 0) 6= 0. The\ndecay of this quantity represents the irreversible conversion of this state to an incoherent mixure of \"up\" and \"down\"\nstates. Again, this is genuine decoherence of the spin state, since the phase information cannot be recovered. The\ntime dependence of \u03c112 when the spin is in a strong field has been calculated by Mozyrsky et al.13 using a Markovian\napproximate master equation. They find that the time scale of the decay due to spin-phonon coupling is very short,\nof the order of the time for a phonon to cross the electron's wavefunction, which is about 10\u221210 s. But the decay is\nincomplete, with \u03c112 retaining all but 10\u22128 of its original value. Their calculation was for Si:P, but a very similar\nresult should hold for the dot case. Decoherence at this level is certainly acceptable for quantum computing. These\nauthors also pointed out that the decay of the remainder of \u03c112 is due to the spin-flip processes computed in this\npaper. If T2 is defined as the dominant decay time of the off-diagonal density matrix element, then T1 = T2 for\nspin-phonon processes.\nA quite different source of decoherence is the hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins. The nuclear spins produce an\neffective random magnetic field on the electrons. Very recent calculations using semiclassical averaging techniques14\nhave obtained a very short relaxation time T\u2206 \u2248 1 ns for GaAs-based dot systems in a strong field. This represents the\ndecay of the transverse magnetization of an ensemble of dots. This is a dephasing time, but not a decoherence time.\nThe electrons spins precess in what is effectively the frozen field of the nuclei. This field is spatially random, and\nthe differential precession of the electron spins leads to the magnetization decay. However, this is not an irreversible\nloss of the phase information of the collective wavefunction. Spin echo exeriments are a very beautiful demonstration\nof precisely this point. This \"inhomogeneous broadening\" presents challenges for the calibration and operation of\nquantum computers, but does not destroy coherence.\nFinally, in any implementation based on electron spin qubits, there will certainly exist small interactions between\nthe spins themselves. The dipole-dipole interaction, for one, cannot be avoided, and there may be indirect spin-spin\ninteractions mediated by the gates. A recent paper suggests that these interactions set the fundamental time scale TM\nfor Si quantum dot implementations of QC15 . These interactions do produce experimental broadening of ESR lines in\nexperiments on bulk systems, and this might be taken as decoherence. In our view, however, these interactions do not\n\n\f3\ndestroy the coherence of a state. The system is the set of all the qubits. During the course of a quantum algorithm\nthey are collectively in a pure state (in principle). Any decoherence that destroys the purity of the state comes from\naveraging over the unknown states of the environment. The broadening that comes from dipole-dipole interactions\ncomes, in NMR and ESR calculations, from averaging over the states of the system itself, which is not an appropriate\nmethod for calculating decoherence. The effect of qubit-qubit interactions that cannot be turned off is to complicate\nthe quantum algorithm. A quantum algorithm is a unitary transformation that must always include the effect of the\nsystem Hamiltonian (including dipole-dipole interactions) in addition to external operations. In every case except for\nvery simple ones, this algorithm must first be computed, presumably with the help of a classical computer. This step\nin QC may be termed \"quantum compilation\". The issue that qubit-qubit interactions raise is not one of decoherence,\nbut rather whether the determination of the algorithm, the complation step, becomes prohibitively difficult. This\ncould happen for two reasons. One is that the interactions are so poorly known that they cannot be corrected for. It\nseems likely that quantum error correction can resolve this difficulty. A second and more interesting possibility that\nthe interactions convert the computation of the algorithm itself into a problem that grows exponentially with the size\nof the system. We regard this as an open question and a deep one, that combines many-body theory with algorithm\ndesign and error correction. We note that in NMR implementations the interaction between the qubits also cannot\nbe turned off, but it can be canceled by refocusing16 .\nIn this paper, our aim is to evaluate the importance of spin-phonon coupling as a source of decoherence in quantum\ndot qubits. Fundamentally, the issue is whether the long relaxation times T1 observed at low temperatures in bulk\nSi:P carry over to SiGe dots proposed for QC. In Sec. II we introduce the structures that we are interested in. In Sec.\nIII the physics of the spin-phonon relaxation mechanism is described qualitatively. In Sec. IV calculations and results\nfor pure Si systems are given as a function of the critical design and operating parameters. In Sec. V are found the\ncorreponding results for structures containing Ge. Sec. VI is the conclusion.\nII.\n\nTHE STRAINED SILICON QUANTUM WELL\n\nSi-Ge heterostructures are utilized widely in the digital electronics industry, and presently have the shortest switching times of any device. One reason for their success lies in the ability to engineer structures of near perfect purity,\nwith control over thicknesses and interfaces that approaches atomic precision \u2013 a technological tour-de-force. An\nequally key achievement has been the harnessing of strain as a tool to control band offsets in heterostructure devices.\nThis paper presents calculations of spin relaxation for real SiGe structures such as those proposed by Vrijen et al.8\nand Friesen et al.9 . Accordingly, we have calculated the electron wavefunctions in quantum wells, which is needed as\ninput for these calculations. Details of these calculations are presented in Ref.9 , and will not be repeated here. In\nthis section we only describe those aspects of the calculations that are germane to spin relaxation.\nQuantum wells are constructed by sandwiching a very thin layer of one material between two others. Electrons\ncan be confined in the quantum well layer when the conduction band offsets produce a potential well. The key to\nthis technology is therefore to understand the band structure of the various layers. In this section we will consider\na particular class of wells formed of pure Si, sandwiched between barrier layers of SiGe. We will find that this is\noptimal from the standpoint of spin coherence. Metallic gates or impurities create zero-dimensional bound states that\ndefine a quantum dot. We first review briefly effective mass theory for dots in pure, unstrained Si, then unstrained\nSiGe, and finally strained Si.\nIn pure Si, the \u2206 conduction band minima occur near the symmetry points X, in the directions {001}. In a perfect\nSi crystal these minima are six-fold degenerate, the valleys being equivalent. In the dot the electron feels a potential\nVg (~r) in addition to the atomic potential, which lifts the degeneracy, though the splittings are not large. The spatial\nvariation of Vg (~r) is on length scales generally much longer than the lattice spacing. For the moment, we shall assume\nthat the electron is in the ground state of Vg (~r) and ignore mixing with any excited states. To the extent that the\nscale of variation of Vg (~r) is much longer than the atomic spacing there are six nearly degenerate ground states. This\nis referred to as the \"valley degeneracy\". The wavefunctions can be written as17\n\u03a6n (~r) =\n\n6\nX\n\n\u03b1(j)\nr )\u03c6j (~r).\nn Fj (~\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nHere, \u03c6j is a Bloch function of the form\n~\n\n\u03c6j (~r) = uj (~r)eikj *~r ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ~kj are the six \u2206 minima {+k0 x\u0302, \u2212k0 x\u0302, +k0 \u0177, \u2212k0 \u0177, +k0 \u1e91, \u2212k0 \u1e91} (we shall always use this ordering), and uj (~r)\nare periodic functions with the same periodicity as the crystal potential Vp (~r). The F\u00b1z are envelope functions that\n\n\f4\nsatisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012 2\n\u0014\n~2\n\u22022\n\u2202\n~2 \u2202 2\n(\u2206)\n\u2212\n+ 2 + Vg (~r) F\u00b1z (~r)) = (E \u2212 Ekz )F\u00b1z (~r),\n\u2212\n2ml \u2202z 2 2mt \u2202x2\n\u2202y\n\n(3)\n\nand are independently normalized to unity, similar to wavefunctions. Analogous equations can be given for the \u00b1x\u0302\nand \u00b1\u0177 minima. We see that Fx = F\u2212x , Fy = F\u2212y , and Fz = F\u2212z , so only three independent envelope functions\nmust be computed. ml and mt are the longitudinal and transverse effective masses associated with the anisotropic\n(\u2206)\nconduction band valleys. Ekz is the \u2206 conduction band edge at kz . The splitting of the degeneracy comes from\n(j)\n\ncorrections to this envelope fuction approximation. Different choices of the constants \u03b1n determine the six states.\nTheir values will be discussed in Sec. III. This formalism is a good approximation for both dot and impurity bound\nstates, as the valley splitings are much smaller than the energy scales in 3.\nGermanium is completely miscible in Si, forming a random alloy. For variable Ge content x, Si1\u2212x Gex exhibits\nmaterials properties that vary gradually over the composition range. The alloy lattice constant, a0 (x), follows a linear\ninterpolation between pure Si and Ge, known as Vegard's law, quite accurately for all x: a0 (x) = (1 \u2212 x)aSi + xaGe 20 .\nElectronic properties show an abrupt change in behavior near x \u2243 0.85, where the Si-like \u2206 minima cross over to\nfour-fold degenerate, Ge-like, L minima. In this work we focus on the range x . 0.5, which is strictly Si-like, though\nwe will have some remarks below on Ge-rich structures. Throughout this range, properties such as effective mass and\nthe dielectric constant vary only slightly from pure Si values. For our calculations, the most important parameter is\nthe conduction band edge, E (\u2206) (x), which remains 6-fold degenerate in the range x . 0.5. The theory of the variation\nof E (\u2206) with x is not germane to the present work, and we simply quote the empirical result, linear in x, which is\nconsistent with Ref.18 :\n\u2206E (\u2206) (x) = E (\u2206) (x) \u2212 E (\u2206) (0) \u2243 0.23x(eV).\n\n(4)\n\n(We note, however, that Ref.19 suggests a slope for E (\u2206) (x) of opposite sign.) The relatively weak variations of the\neffective mass and the dielectric constant will be ignored here.\nWe consider thin Si wells in which the Si layer grows pseudomorphically. The in-plane lattice constant, ak , must\nbe the same for all the layers, causing a tetragonal distortion in the strained layer(s). Here we consider the case of\nstrained Si grown on the (001) surface of relaxed Si1\u2212x Gex . The in-plane Si lattice constant depends on x as\nak (x) = (1 \u2212 x)aSi + xaGe .\n\n(5)\n\nSince aGe > aSi , the Si is under tensile strain in the plane. Hence, the out-of-plane Si lattice constant, a\u22a5 , is reduced\naccording to continuum elastic theory:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nc12 ak (x) \u2212 aSi\na\u22a5 (x) = aSi 1 \u2212 2\n,\n(6)\nc11\naSi\nwhere c11 and c12 are elastic constants for pure Si.\nStrain produces shifts of the \u2206 band proportional to the strain variables\n\u03b5k (x) =\n\nak (x) \u2212 aSi\naSi\n\nand\n\n\u03b5\u22a5 (x) =\n\na\u22a5 (x) \u2212 aSi\n.\naSi\n\n(7)\n(\u2206)\n\n(\u2206)\n\nwith proportionality constants called the dilational and uniaxial deformation potentials, \u039ed and \u039eu , respectively.\nBecause of the anisotropic nature of the strain, the two \u1e91 minima are shifted down relative to the x\u0302 and \u0177 minima,\nresulting in a splitting of the \u2206 conduction band. The net shifts with respect to the unstrained Si \u2206 band are given\nby18\n1\n)(2\u03b5k (x) + \u03b5\u22a5 (x)) +\n+ \u039e(\u2206)\n3 u\n1\n(\u2206)\n\u2206E (\u2206k ) (x) = (\u039ed + \u039e(\u2206)\n)(2\u03b5k (x) + \u03b5\u22a5 (x)) \u2212\n3 u\n(\u2206)\n\n\u2206E (\u2206\u22a5 ) (x) = (\u039ed\n\n2 (\u2206)\n\u039e (\u03b5\u22a5 (x) \u2212 \u03b5k (x)),\n3 u\n1 (\u2206)\n\u039e (\u03b5\u22a5 (x) \u2212 \u03b5k (x)).\n3 u\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nThe first terms in Eqs. (8) and (9) are hydrostatic strain terms, which lower the conduction edge compared to\nunstrained Si. The second terms in Eqs. (8) and (9) produce the splitting, associated with uniaxial strain. To perform\nour calculations, we use the materials parameters given in Table I. However we note that the deformation potentials,\n(\u2206)\nparticularly \u039ed , are very difficult to measure experimentally. Considerable disagreement exists in the literature as\n\n\f5\n(\u2206)\n\nto the value and even the sign of \u039ed 21 . The value given in Table I was reported (but not endorsed!) in Ref.21 , and\nprovides energy band variations in general agreement with Refs.18 and19 . We arrive at the following strain-induced\nshifts of the conduction band edge for pure Si:\n\u2206E (\u2206\u22a5 ) = \u22120.86x\n\nand\n\n\u2206E (\u2206k ) = \u22120.16x.\n\n(10)\n\nThe corresponding shift in the relaxed barrier layers, due to the presence of Ge, was given in Eq. (4). Together, these\nresults describe the conduction band offsets for the quantum well that are used in our simulations.\nWe now apply our results to two specific quantum well designs of interest for quantum computing. Design (1),\nshown in the inset of Fig. 1, is a version of that proposed by Vrijen et al.8 , in which electrons are trapped on donor\nions (usually P), implanted in a semiconductor matrix. In that work, the quantum well is split into Ge-rich and\nSi-rich regions to facilitate single qubit operations. For simplicity, we consider here a uniform quantum well, formed\nof pure Si, with a single dopant ion located at the center of the well. In such a device, single qubit operations can\nbe accomplished using a coded qubit scheme22 . Design (2), proposed by Friesen et al.9 , is shown in Fig. 2. The\nconfinement potential for the electrons is much softer than in design (1). Electrons are trapped vertically by the\nquantum well, and laterally by the electrostatic potential arising from lithographically patterned, metallic top-gates.\nAdditionally, the quantum dot is tunnel-coupled to a degenerate doped back-gate. The dimensions for both designs\nare given in the figures.\nThe wave function of the bound electron is computed in the envelope function formalism, Eq. (3). Couplings\nbetween the different valleys are introduced through the perturbation theory described in Sec. IV. This procedure\n(i)\nprovides the specific values of \u03b1g for the ground state, which we use in our calculations.\nThe abrupt conduction band offsets are handled by matching the ground state wave function \u03a6g (~r) and \u2202z \u03a6g (~r)\nat the interfaces. (Remember that we have equated effective masses on both sides of interfaces.) Due to linear\nindependence of the Bloch functions, the boundary conditions do not cause mixing of the envelope functions. Solutions\nof Eq. (3) and the analogous Fx equation are obtained, using commercial 3D finite element software.\nAs will be seen in Sec. V, the key quantity for the computation of T1 is f 2 , which describes the probability for the\nbound electron to be on a Ge atom. Ge is associated with reduced coherence times, by virtue of its large spin-orbit\ncoupling. Referring to Eq. (1), one deduces that this probability may be expressed as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n2\n3\n2\n(z) 2\n3\n2\nf 2 = x 4(\u03b1(x)\n)\nd\nr\nF\n(r)\n+\n2(\u03b1\n)\nd\nr\nF\n(r)\n,\n(11)\ng\nx\ng\nz\n\u03a9b\n\n\u03a9b\n\nwhere \u03a9b is the volume outside the quantum well, if the well is pure Si. The subscript g refers to the ground state.\nThe term in square brackets reflects the probability of finding the bound electron in a barrier region, while x gives\nthe probability that the electron is on a Ge site.\nFig. 1 shows the results of our calculations for f 2 in design (1), as a function of the Ge concentration, x, in the\nSi1\u2212x Gex barriers. For x > 0.02, f 2 decreases with x for two reasons. First, as x increases, the conduction band offset\nat the quantum well also increases, allowing less of the wavefunction to penetrate the barrier. Second, the spatial\nextent the electron in the \u1e91 direction is greater for Fx than Fz , because of the anisotropic effective mass . However,\nless of Fx is mixed into the wavefunction for large x, since \u03b1x becomes very small. For x . 0.02, f 2 drops quickly to\nzero, due to the absence of Ge in the barriers. In the actual design of Vrijen et al.,8 there is Ge in the active layer.\nTo give an idea of the effect of this, we include an equivalent value of f 2 for such a structure.\nFig. 2 shows results of the f 2 calculation for design (2), as a function of the quantum well thickness, z. To perform\nthe calculations, we have considered a fixed Ge concentration, x = 0.05, and taken the limit of large strain, so that\n\u221a\n(\u00b1x)\n(\u00b1y)\n(\u00b1z)\n\u03b1g\n\u2243 \u03b1g\n\u2243 0 and \u03b1g\n\u2243 1/ 2 for the ground state. As z increases, less of the wavefunction penetrates the\nbarrier regions, causing f 2 to decrease.\nIII.\n\nSPIN RELAXATION DUE TO COUPLING TO PHONONS\n\nIn this section we give the method for calculating T1 , the spin-flip time of a spin qubit in the ground orbital state\ndue to emission or absorption of a phonon, following the logic used by Hasegawa10 and Roth11 for bulk Si.\nConsider a single impurity with a unit positive charge, such as a phosphorus atom, at the origin. In the absence\nof central cell corrections, there is a 12-fold degenerate ground state, including spin. This valley degeneracy of the\nground state is reduced to two by these corrections, and the splitting between the 2-fold spin-degenerate ground state\nand the higher states is of order \u2206E \u223c 10 meV. We shall discuss the detailed linear combinations (\u03b1-values) of the\nstates below, as the coefficients giving the various valley amplitudes play an important role in the calculation of matrix\nelements. These twelve states may all be thought of as hydrogenic 1s states. The splitting of 1s and 2s is about\n\n\f6\n30 meV , larger than the 10 meV valley splittings. Let us now split the 2-fold degenerate ground state by applying a\nDC magnetic field in the z-direction. The transition rates between these states are denoted by W\u2191\u2193 and W\u2193\u2191 . The\nrelaxation time T1 is defined by 1/T1 = W\u2191\u2193 + W\u2193\u2191 .\nThe transitions are caused by phonons, but there are important approximate symmetries that suppress these\ntransitions. These are: (1) spin rotation symmetry, meaning that the electron spin cannot be flipped by a phonon;\nthis symmetry is broken by SOC; (2) time-reversal symmetry, meaning that one state cannot be changed into its\ntime-reversed partner by emission or absorption of a phonon; this symmetry is broken by the external magnetic field;\n(3) point group symmetries; these are partially broken when strain is applied.\nThe spin rotation symmetry would rule out phonon-mediated transitions between the two states entirely if there\nwere no spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This means that the effects of SOC on the wavefunctions, even though these\neffects are small in relatively low-Z Si, must be taken into account. When we refer to a state as \u2191 or \u2193, these symbols\nmust be taken to refer to the majority spin content of the state, not to a pure spin state. Transition rates are roughly\nproportional to (g \u2212 2)2 , [more precisely (gl \u2212 gt )2 , where gt (gl ) is the transverse (longitudinal) g-factor, see below for\ndefinitions].\nThe time-reversal symmetry implies that transitions cannot take place directly between Kramers-degenerate states\neven in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The direct phonon-mediated transitions between the two states of interest\nto us are strongly suppressed by this approximate symmetry. It is broken only by the external field H. The fastest\nprocesses then involve virtual excitation to higher-energy states that are mixed into the ground state by H. Hence\n2\n1/T1 involves a factor (\u03bcB H/\u2206E) . There is an additional factor of H 2 from the phonon density of states, giving an\noverall rate 1/T1 \u223c H 4 in the limit of small H.\nThe point group symmetry is reduced from cubic to tetragonal under strain. This has complex effects that we will\nexplain below.\nBefore giving actual calculations, we summarize those differences between the electrons in donor impurity states\nand in an artificial dot that affect T1 . The most obvious is the single-particle potential that binds the electron. The\ngate potential is much smoother than the hydrogenic potential of the impurity. This implies that the corrections\nto the effective mass approximation are much weaker, and \u2206E will be much reduced. It is difficult to compute the\nenergy splittings precisely, but considerations based on the method of Sham and Nakayama23 give splittings in the\nrange \u223c 0.05\u22120.1 meV in the structure of Friesen et al.9 . This increases the relaxation rate. (In fact a naive estimate\nof the enhancement is a factor of 400.) On the other hand, the structures we consider have strong lattice strain. This\npartly lifts the valley degeneracy and also reduces the matrix elements, which decreases the rate. Another aspect of\nsome of the proposed designs is the presence of Ge with its much stronger SOC. This will act to decrease the spin\nrelaxation time.\nIV.\n\nPURE SI QUANTUM DOTS\n\nWe consider first the case of pure Si under uniaxial strain. The ingredients of the calculation are as follows.\nFrom Sec. II we have the solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation [H0 + Vg (~r)]\u03a6n0 (~r) = En \u03a6n0 (~r). H0 is the\nunperturbed crystal Hamiltonian without SOC and it has the full space group symmetry. Vg (~r) is the gate and/or\nimpurity potential.\nP\n~~ *S\n~ ~ . The\nTo calculate T1 , we must also include SOC, which we treat as a perturbation: HSOC = \u03bbSi R~ L\nR\nR\nresulting states \u03a6n (~r) are two-fold degenerate because of time-reversal symmetry. Let us denote these states as\n\u03a6n\u2191 (~r) and \u03a6n\u2193 (~r). They are not eigenstates of spin, so the arrows denote pseudo-spin. We may define the pseudoup state as that which evolves from the spin-up state as spin-orbit coupling is turned on adiabatically, and similarly\nfor the pseudo-down state. Because of valley and pseudospin degeneracy, there are 2 ground states \u03a6gs (~r) and 10\nexcited states \u03a6rs (~r). The 12-fold degeneracy in the effective mass approximation is broken by central-cell corrections\nin the impurity case and smaller corrections in the quantum dot.\n~ * (L\n~ + 2S).\n~ In the field \u03a6n\u2191 (~r) and \u03a6n\u2193 (~r)\nThere is also the Zeeman Hamiltonian of the external field HZ = \u03bcB B\n~\nare no longer degenerate. Note that the energy splitting may depend on the direction of B.\nFinally, we have the electron-phonon coupling Hamiltonian Hep . A phonon represents a time-dependent perturbation. This will create transitions whose rate is given by the Fermi golden rule. We are interested in the transitions\nbetween \u03a6g\u2191 (~r) and \u03a6g\u2193 (~r). However, h\u03a6g\u2191 (~r)|Hep |\u03a6g\u2193 (~r)i = 0 in the absence of the external field. Thus we need\nto calculate in next order in perturbation theory using an effective Hamiltonian\nH\u2032 =\n\nX\nrs\n\n1\n{[ HZ |\u03a6rs (~r)i h\u03a6rs (~r)|Hep ] + [ Hep |\u03a6rs (~r)i h\u03a6rs (~r)|HZ ]}\nEg \u2212 Er\n\nHere r runs over the excited states, r = 2, .., 6. s =\u2191, \u2193.\n\n(12)\n\n\f7\nP\n2\nThe relaxation time is given by 1/T1 = W\u2191\u2193 + W\u2193\u2191 , where W\u2193\u2191 = (2\u03c0/~) \u00d7 q~\u03bb | h\u03a6g\u2191 (~r)| H\u2032 |\u03a6g\u2193 (~r)i| \u03b4(Eg\u2193 \u2212\nEg\u2191 \u2212 ~\u03c9q~\u03bb ) [1 + n(\u03c9q~\u03bb )] is the rate for transitions from the higher-energy (pseudo-spin down) state to the lowerP\n2\nenergy (pseudo-spin up) state and W\u2191\u2193 = (2\u03c0/~) q~\u03bb | h \u03a6g\u2193 (~r) |H\u2032 | \u03a6g\u2191 (~r)i| \u03b4(Eg\u2193 \u2212 Eg\u2191 \u2212 ~\u03c9q~\u03bb ) n(\u03c9q~\u03bb ) is the rate\nfor transitions from the lower-energy (pseudo-spin up) state to the higher-energy (pseudo-spin down) state where the\nsum is over phonon modes ~\nq \u03bb with energies \u03c9q~\u03bb .

If the original g were isotropic, then g \u2032 = 0 and there would be no coupling\nbetween different states and no spin relaxation.\nIf the lattice is strained, then the \u03b1 coefficients become strain-dependent and the general expression for D from Eq.\n13 must be used. Uniaxial strain lifts the degeneracy of the valleys. We include this effect in the Hamiltonian and it\n(i)\ndetermines the proper combinations of the \u03b1n defined in Eq. 1. These then feed into Dgr .

The matrix elements of the electron-phonon interaction are\nonly nonzero within one valley and for a single phonon mode they are conventionally parametrized as:\nD\nE\n(i)\n(i)\n(~\nq\u03bb)\nk (i) ) * ~q + h.c.\n(20)\nk (i) b\n\u03a8 ~ (~r)|Hep\n|\u03a8 ~ \u2032 (~r) = ibq~\u03bb eb\u03bb (~q) * (\u039ed 1 + \u039eu b\ncks\n\nck s\n\nnear the ith valley, where ~q = ~k \u2212 ~k \u2032 and eb\u03bb is the polarization vector. bq~\u03bb destroys a phonon with wavevector ~q and\npolarization \u03bb. Once again, we see that the interaction can be characterized by just 2 parameters, in this case \u039ed and\n\u039eu , as already defined in Eq. 7.

This is our basic result, in a form very similar to that given by Hasegawa10.\nIn Fig. 3 the effect of strain on the lowest energy levels is shown. Here the zero-strain splittings are those of a P\nimpurity. A similar plot was given in Ref.4 , but at that time the correct zero-strain splittings were not known. In\nthe dot, the energy splittings for the unstrained case would be two to three orders of magnitude smaller (see below\nfor a discussion).\nIn Fig. 4, we show the effect of strain on the relaxation time of an electron in a P impurity potential. There are\ntwo effects: the overall increase of the energy denominators and the change of the ground state to a less symmetric\nvalley weighting. This leads to a non-monotonic dependence of T1 on strain, but in the region of interest, the effect\nof strain is to greatly increase T1 , since most proposed structures have s < \u22121. At large strain, only one energy\ndenominator remains small, that between the ground state, symmetric in the \u00b1z valleys, and the first excited state,\nantisymmetric in the \u00b1z valleys. The overlap matrix D is very small between these two state. This reduction of the\nmatrix element is the dominant effect.\n\n\f9\nAlso of interest is the dependence of T1 on the angle of the external field, since this may serve as a diagnostic tool\nin experiments to verify that the relaxation process is really due to spin-phonon coupling. As a function of strain,\nthis dependence becomes highly anisotropic, as seen in Fig. 5. This is due to the elimination of all but the \u00b1z valleys\nfrom the problem at high strain. We note that the limiting value T1 \u2192 \u221e when the external field is along a crystal\naxis is cut off by intervalley scattering effects not included in the present calculation4 .\nThe change in the confining potential reduces the corrections to the effective mass approximation, as discussed in\nSec. III which in turn reduces the energy denominators, leading to a decrease in T1 . In the Friesen et al. structure,\nwe have estimated the splitttings Er \u2212 Eg using the method of Sham and Nakayama23, and they range from 0.05 to\n0.1 meV, depending on the gate voltages that produce the potential. This may be incorporated into the calculation\n(i)\nof the \u03b1n by introducing a variable coupling \u2206c that mixes the \u00b1x and \u00b1y valley wavefunctions with the \u00b1z valley\nwavefunctions. For a precise definition of \u2206c , see Ref.4 . Approximately, however, \u2206c \u223c 0.2 (Er \u2212 Eg ) < 10\u22124 eV .\nThe results of the calculations are shown in Fig. 6. The graphs show the absolutely crucial role that strain plays in\nthe determination of T1 . Because of the small energy denominators in the dot, the rate is extremely fast at small \u2206c\nfor the unstrained case: 1/T1 \u223c \u2206\u22122\nc .\nWe also point out that in stuctures where T1 appears to be too long for efficient preparation of the spins (as discussed\nin Sec. I) the deficiency can be made up by increasing the temperature T . As seen in Fig. 7, T1 decreases very rapidly\nas T is increased. Actually, this calculation even underestimates the decrease, since multiphonon processes begin to\ncontribute at about 3K. However, it must be borne in mind that the temperature must be small enough that the\ninitial state is essentially pure (all spins up, for example). A more practical method of decreasing T1 if desired, would\nbe to increase the magnetic field.\nV.\n\nSTRUCTURES CONTAINING GE\n\nThe effect of alloying with Ge is to increase the SOC and hence to increase |g \u2212 2|. First principles calculations\nof Ge impurities in Si have shown that there is little effect on the states near the bottom of the conduction band,\nthough this is not necessarily the case for higher energy states in the band25 . This is in accord with the isoelectronic\ncharacter of the atoms in the alloy. It is then reasonable to employ the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). The\napproximation should be quantitatively accurate for small, (say < 10%) concentrations of Ge, but may be taken as a\ngood qualitative guide also to higher concentrations. The Bloch functions in the absence of SOC satisfy\nH0 \u03a8n~ks = En~k \u03a8n~ks ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\nNc X\n2\n3\nX\n1 X\n\u03a8n~ks = \u221a\nexp(i~k * rjl )\nalm (n~k) \u03c6ms (~r \u2212 rjl )\nNc j=1 l=1\nm=0\n\n(27)\n\nwhere Nc is the number of unit cells, j labels the unit cells, l labels the two positions in the unit cell, m labels the 4\natomic states, \u03c6ms are the atomic orbitals, and the coefficients alm (n~k) give the proper linear combination of atomic\norbitals (LCAO's) for the state at momentum ~k and band n.

Then we have\ngz (x) \u2212 2 = [gz (0) \u2212 2] [(1 \u2212 x) + x(\u03bbGe /\u03bbSi )] , where gz (0) is the value for pure silicon. The numbers, known from\natomic physics, are \u03bbGe /\u03bbSi = 0.295/0.044 = 6.71, so gz (x) \u2212 2 = [gz (0) \u2212 2] [(1 \u2212 x) + 6.71x] . Similarly, we have\ngy (x) \u2212 2 = [gy (0) \u2212 2] [(1 \u2212 x) + 6.71x] , etc. Only the overall scale of g changes, not the anisotropy in the VCA.\nThe presence of Ge in the lattice breaks the translation symmetry, an effect that is neglected in the VCA. Taking\nthis into account would lead to a g-factor that is averaged over momentum space rather than one that is evaluated\nonly at the Si conduction band minima. If we take the L-minimum of pure Ge as an example, we would expect that\nthe corrections to |g \u2212 2| would be greater if there is some averaging over momentum space. Thus a calculation going\nbeyond the VCA would give corrections that would reduce T1 .\nWe show the results for differing Ge concentrations in the active region of the well in Fig. 8. In the Ge-poor regime\nx < 0.85, the relaxation rate 1/T1 decreases fairly slowly. Thus designs with a Si-rich well will not suffer from very\nfast spin relaxation on the minority Ge sites.\nBy contrast, if we cross the critical point around x = 0.85 where the conduction band minima switch positions,\nthen there is a very rapid decrease of T1 . This is due to the much greater g-factor anisotropy of the [111] minima:\ng \u2032 \u2248 \u22120.4, (as compared to g \u2032 < 0.001 in Si). The results for the Ge-rich region are much simpler than in the Si-rich\nregion. Uniaxial strain does not affect the relative valley energies or the matrix elements parametrized by D. The\nonly effect of going to the dot from the impurity is to reduce corrections to the effective mass approximation, which\nwill strongly decrease the relaxation time. Indeed, if we take the impurity result for Ge:P from Ref.10 , which is\nT1 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 s and estimate the decrease in \u2206E as about a factor of 100, then we obtain T1 \u223c 10\u22126 to 10\u22127 s,\nwhich is vastly shorter than that of Si-rich structures. The physics is the same as that which governs the divergence\nof the rate in Fig. 6 for the unstrained case,namely the much smaller energy denominators.\nTo make contact with Sec. II note that if there is Ge in the barrier regions, as is the case in most SiGe designs, then\nwe will have\nP an envelope function that weights Si and Ge differently, then x in the VCA formulas must be replaced\nby f 2 = R~ |fR~ |2 , where |fR~ |2 is the amplitude that the electron is on a Ge site and the sum runs only over Ge\nsites, as described in Sec. II. This is the product of the Ge concentration in the layer, times the probability that the\nelectron is on the layer, summed over layers. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, we see that f 2 is always less than 10\u22123 for\nstructures that have pure Si active layers and Ge in the barrier layers. The effect on T1 is small so these structures\nare \"phonon-safe\".\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDecoherence due to spin relaxation by emission and absorption of single phonons does not pose a major obstacle to\nquantum computation in quantum dot SiGe heterostructures using spin qubits, if these qubits are properly designed.\nThis spin relaxation mechanism is the dominant one in the case of electrons in donor bound states, such as in Si:P.\nIn order that this source of decoherence be kept under control, however, certain conditions must be satisfied in the\ndesign of the structure. Unstrained SiGe alloys generally have relatively short spin relaxation times due to valley\n\n\f11\ndegeneracy. This degeneracy produces strong spin mixing in the Kramers-degenerate ground states of the quantum\ndot once the field is turned on. This in turn increases the electron-phonon matrix element that connects the two states\nand decreases the relaxation time. This effect, fundamentally due to spin-orbit coupling, is stronger in the quantum\ndot than in the impurity state. The corrections to effective-mass theory, stronger for the impurity potential, tend to\nlift the degeneracy.\nThe crucial role that strain plays, in Si-rich structures, is to lift the valley degeneracy. In this respect compressive\nuniaxial strain is the best, since the residual degeneracy is reduced to two valleys. The wavefunction for the ground\nstate is then symmetric in the valley index, and the first excited state, the only one with a small energy denominator,\nis antisymmetric in this index. This fact strongly suppresses the spin mixing effect of the external field. Thus a\nworkable design should include uniaxial strain that exceeds a critical value. This value is small enough that there will\nbe sufficient strain in most practical structures in which the active layer is Si rich and sandwiched between relatively\nGe-rich layers. The active layer must be thin enough to avoid dislocation-mediated relaxation.\nSpin-orbit coupling is stronger in Ge than in Si due to the higher atomic number. This suggests that Si-rich\nstructures are to be preferred, and the calculations bear this out. The relaxation time decreases with increasing x\nin a Si1\u2212x Gex alloy. In fact, if x increases beyond x = 0.85, decoherence becomes very strong, and quantum dots in\nthese Ge-rich structures, such as those proposed by Vrijen et al.8 , may well run into difficulties for this reason. A\nkey point for these structures is that uniaxial stress does not lift the valley degeneracy, since the valleys have moved\noff the crystal axes. Strain-induced suppression of spin relaxation cannot occur.\nBeyond design issues, fabrication quality is also important. Even a small concentration of magnetic impurities will\nnegatively impact the spin relaxation. In modern semiconductor technology, however, concentrations of magnetic\nimpurities much less than 0.1 ppm are routine. The impact of lattice imperfections is less clear. These will generally\nact to lower the symmetry of the system, and to lessen the accuracy of the effective-mass approximation. As we have\nseen in the context of the impurity calculations, these effects generally increase the spin relaxation time because of\nreduced degeneracy. On the other hand, localized bound states can form at such imperfections. If this results in\nfree electron spins, it could have seriously negative effects on the relaxation time. Similar effects would result from\nlattice defects that produce localized phonon modes.\nFinally, it appears that quantum dot designs will need rather low temperatures in order to operate. The impurity\nexperiments clearly indicate that multi-phonon relaxation increase rapidly with temperature26 , with a crossover to\nthis regime at about 3 K. We speculate that this crossover temperature is pushed up when the effects of strain are\nincluded, but we have not yet done the requisite calculations.\nWe would like to acknowledge useful discussions with our collaborators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison\nand with Xuedong Hu.

The rate is plotted\nfor varying the intervalley coupling constant \u2206c . \u2206c corresponds to 1/6th the energy splitting between the singlet (ground\nstate) and triplet (next excited state) valley energies in unstrained Si.

The magnetic field is set at 1 T along the [111] direction and the temperature is 3 K. Here we assume that the\naddition of germanium does not affect the strain within the bulk and only acts to increase the g-factor and spin orbit coupling.\nWe expect this approximation to hold for small concentrations of germanium and to break down with increasing concentration\nas the conduction band valley minima switch from the X type of silicon to the L type of germanium.\n\n\f"}
