Introduction\nAs said before, [24], the symmetric functions are an exceedingly fascinating object of study; they\nare best studied from the Hopf algebraic point of view (in my opinion), although they carry quite\na good deal more important structures, indeed so much that whole books do not suffice, but see\n[26, 27, 31, 33, 34].\nThe first of the two generalizations to be discussed is the Hopf algebra, NSymm, of\nnoncommutative symmetric functions (over the integers). As an algebra, more precisely a ring,\nthis is simply the free associative ring over the integers, Z , in countably many indeterminates\nNSymm = Z Z1 , Z2 ,L\n\n(1.1)\n\nand the coalgebra structure is given by the comultiplication determined by\n\u03bc : Zn a\n\n\u2211Z \u2297Z ,\n\ni+j =n\n\ni\n\nj\n\nwhere Z0 =1\n\nand i and j are in N \u222a {0} = {0,1,2,L} . The augmentation is given by\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n\u03b5(Zn ) = 0, n = 1,2,3,L\n\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\n(and, of course \u03b5(Z0 ) = \u03b5(1)= 1). The Hopf algebra NSymm is a noncommutative covering\ngeneralization of the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions,\nSymm = Z[z1 ,z2,L]\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere the zn are seen as either the elementary symmetric functions en or the complete\nsymetric functions hn . The interpretation of the zn as the hn seems to work out somewhat\nnicer, for instance in obtaining the standard inner product autoduality of Symm in terms of the\nnatural duality between NSymm and QSymm, the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions,\nsee [24], section 6. QSymm will be described and discussed later in this paper.\nThe projection is given by\nNSymm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm, Zn a zn\n\n(1.5)\n\nand is a morphism of Hopf algebras.\nThe systematic investigation of NSymm as a noncommutative generalization of Symm\nwas started in [14] and continued in a whole slew of subsequent papers, e.g. [7, 8, 9, 20, 21, 22,\n23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 46].\nIt is amazing how much of the theory of Symm has natural noncommutative analogues.\nThis includes Newton primitives, Schur functions, representation theoretic interpretations,\ndeterminental formulas now involving the quasideterminants of Gel'fand - Retakh, [12, 13]),\nCapelli and Sylvester identities, and much more. And, not rarely, the noncommutative versions\nare more elegant than their commutative counterparts.\nNote, however, that in most of these papers the noncommutative symmetric functions are\nstudied over a fixed field K of characteristic zero and not over the integers (or a field of positive\ncharacteristic). This makes quite a difference, see section 3 below. The papers [19, 20, 21, 22,\n23] focuss on the case over the integers, as does the present paper.\nIt should be stressed that NSymm attracts a lot of attention not only as a natural\ngeneralization of Symm. It turns up spontaneously. For instance in terms of representations of\nthe Hecke algebras at zero, [8, 24, 30, 46] and as the direct sum of the Solomon descent algebras\nof the symmetric groups, [1, 10, 14, 35, 43, 44] and [39], Ch. 9. Moreover there are e.g.\napplications to noncommutative continued fractions, Pad\u00e9 approximants, and a variety of\ninterrelations with quantum groups and quantum enveloping algebras, [2, 14, 29, 37]. Further,\nthe duals, the quasisymmetric functions, first turned up (under that name) in the theory of plane\npartitions and counting permutations with given descent sets, [15, 16, 45]. Actually, QSymm,\nprecisely as the graded dual of NSymm, goes back at least to 1972 in the theory of\nnoncommutative formal groups, [5]. See [20] for an outline of the role played by QSymm in that\ncontext. An application of NSymm to chromatic polynomials is in [11].\nGiven a Hopf algebra H , with multiplication m and comultiplication \u03bc , a primitive in H is\nan element P of H such that\n\u03bc(P) = 1\u2297 P + P \u22971\n\n(1.6)\n\nThe primitives of a Hopf algebra form a Lie algebra under the commutator product\n[P1,P2] = P1 P2 \u2212 P2 P1\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhich is denoted Prim(H). For any Hopf algebra there is strong interest ina description of its Lie\nalgebra of primitives. For instance because of the Milnor - Moore theorem, [36], that says that a\ngraded connected cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of characteristic zero is isomorphic\nto to the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra of primitives. Also, far from unrelated,\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n3\n\nlet Q(H ) = I(H)/ I(H)2 be the module of indecomposables of a graded Hopf algebra H. Here\nI(H) is the augmentation ideal of H . Then there is an induced duality between Q(H ) and\nPrim( H\u2217 ), and there is the (classical) Leray theorem that says that for a connected commutative\ngraded Hopf algebra H over a characteristic zero field any section of I(H)\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Q(H) induces\nan isomorphism of the free commutative algebra over Q(A) to H. This last theorem now has\nbeen considerably generalized to the setting of operads, see [38], and the references quoted there.\nThe first main topic that is treated in some detail (but without proofs) in this survey is an explicit\nand algorithmic description of a basis over the integers of Prim(NSymm).\nA divided power sequence in a Hopf algebra H is a sequence of elements\nd = (d(0) = 1,d(1),d(2),L)\n\n(1.8)\n\nsuch that for all n\n\u03bcH (d(n)) =\n\n\u2211d(i) \u2297 d( j)\n\ni, j \u2208{1,2,3,L}\n\n(1.9)\n\ni+ j =n\n\nNote that d(1) is a primitive. Is is sometimes useful to write a DPS (divided power sequence) as\na power series in a counting variable t:\nd(t) = 1+ d(1)t + d(2)t2 + d(3)t 3 + L\n\n(1.10)\n\nThat makes it easier to talk about the inverse of a DPS (inverse power series), the product of two\nDPS's (multiplication of power series) and shifted DPS's: d(t) a d(t n ), all operations that give\nnew DPS's from old ones. When written in the form (1.10) a DPS is often called a curve.\nIt turns out that each primitive of Prim(NSymm) can be extended to a divided power sequence.\nThis is important because it implies that as a coalgebra NSymm is the cocommutative cofree\ngraded coalgebra over the module Prim(NSymm).\nNow let QSymm be the graded dual Hopf algebra (over the integers) of NSymm. For an explicit\ndescription of QSymm, the Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions, see below in section 2.\nA most important question concerning QSymm is whether it is free polynomial as a\ncommutative algebra. This has been an important issue since 1972, since it is crucial for the\ndevelopment of certain parts of the theory of noncommutative formal groups, [5, 6, 17]. The\nmatter was finally settled in 1999, [21], in the positive sense that it is indeed free. A second proof\nfollows from the cofreeness of NSymm. However, both these proofs fail to produce explicit\ngenerators. This has now also been taken care of, [23], and is the second main topic that will be\ndiscussed in some detail below.\nOne most interesting and important aspect of the structure of Symm is the presence of two\nfamilies of Hopf algebra morphisms that are called Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms.\nThey satisfy a large number of beautiful relations. The third main topic of this survey is to what\nextent these can be lifted to NSymm, respectively, extended to QSymm. There are both positive\nand negative results. However, the matter has not yet been quite completely settled.\nThis paper is an expanded write-up of two talks that I gave on the subject: in Krasnoyarsk in\nAugust 2002 at the occasion of the International Conference \"Algebra and its applications\" in\nhonour of the 70-th anniversary of V P Shunkov and the 65-th anniversary of V M Busarkin, and\nat the Z. Borewicz memorial conference in Skt Petersburg in September 2002.\n2. The Hopf algebra QSymm of quasisymmetric functions.\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n4\n\nAbove, in the introduction, the graded Hopf algebra NSymm of noncommutative symmetric\nfunctions was defined. The grading is defined by\nwt(Zn ) = n\n\n(2.1)\n\nand, more generally, if \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] is a nonempty word over the positive integers\nN = {1,2,L} , let Z\u03b1 be the noncomutative monomial\nZ\u03b1 = Z a1 Za2 LZa m\n\n(2.2)\n\nwt(Z\u03b1 ) = wt(\u03b1 ) = a1 +L + am\n\n(2.3)\n\nthen\n\nLet Z[ ] = 1 , where [ ] is the empty word, then the Z\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208N\u2217 , the monoid of words over N\nform a basis of NSymm (as a graded Abelian group). The empty word, and also Z[ ] = 1 , has\nweight zero.\nAs a free Abelian graded group QSymm, the graded dual of NSymm can be taken to be the free\nAbelian group with as basis N\u2217 , the words over the set of natural numbers. The duality is then\n< Z \u03b1 ,\u03b2 >= \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe duality induced comultiplication is easy to describe. It is 'cut':\nm\n\n[a1 ,a2 ,L,am ] a \u2211 [a1 ,L,ai ] \u2297[ai +1,L,am ]\n\n(2.5)\n\ni =0\n\nwhere of course [a1 ,L,ai ] = [ ] =1 if i = 0 and [ai+1 ,Lam ] = [ ] = 1 if i = m . The duality\ninduced multiplication is more difficult to describe. It is the socalled 'overlapping shuffle\nmultiplication' which can be described as follows.\nLet \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] and \u03b2 = [b1,b2 ,L,bn ] be two compositions or words. Take a 'sofar\nempty' word with n + m \u2212 r slots where r is an integer between 0 and min{m, n},\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 min{m,n} . Choose m of the available n + m \u2212 r slots and place in it the natural numbers\nfrom \u03b1 in their original order; choose r of the now filled places; together with the remaining\nn + m \u2212 r \u2212 m = n \u2212 r places these form n slots; in these place the entries from \u03b2 in their\norginal order; finally, for those slots which have two entries, add them. The product of the two\nwords \u03b1 and \u03b2 is the sum (with multiplicities) of all words that can be so obtained. So, for\ninstance,\n[a,b] \u00d7osh [c,d] = [a,b,c,d]+ [a,c,b, d] + [a,c,d,b] +[c,a,b,d] +[c, a,d,b]+ [c,d,a,b] +\n+[a + c,b,d] +[a + c, d,b] + [c,a + d,b] +[a, b + c, d] + [a,c,b + d] +\n+[c,a,b + d] +[a + c, b + d]\n\n(2.6)\n\nand [1]\u00d7osh [1]\u00d7osh [1] = 6[1,1,1]+3[1,2]+3[2,1]+[3].\nThere is a concrete realization of QSymm much like the standard realization of Symm as the\nring of symmetric functions in infinitely many indeterminates x1,x 2,L. See [34], Chapter 1 for\nsome detail on how to work with infinitely many indeterminates in this context.\nLet X be a finite or infinite set (of commuting variables) and consider the ring of\npolynomials, R[X] , and the ring of power series, R[[X]] , over a commutative ring R with unit\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n5\n\nelement in the commuting variables from X. A polynomial or power series f (X) \u2208 R[[X]] is\ncalled symmetric if for any two finite sequences of indeterminates x1,x 2,L, x n and y1, y2 ,L,y n\nfrom X and any sequence of exponents i1,i2 ,L,in \u2208N , the coefficients in f (X) of x1i1 x2i2 Lx nin\nand y1i1 y2i2 Ly nin are the same.\nThe quasi-symmetric formal power series are a generalization introduced by Gessel, [15],\nin connection with the combinatorics of plane partitions. This time one takes a totally ordered set\nof indeterminates, e.g. V = {v1,v 2 ,L}, with the ordering that of the natural numbers, and the\ncondition is that the coefficients of x1i1 x2i2 Lx nin and y1i1 y2i2 Ly nin are equal for all totally ordered\nsets of indeterminates x1 < x2 <L < xn and y1 < y2 < L< yn . Thus, for example,\nx1x22 + x 2x 32 + x1 x32\n\n(2.7)\n\nis a quasi-symmetric polynomial in three variables that is not symmetric.\nProducts and sums of quasi-symmetric polynomials and power series are again quasisymmetric (obviously), and thus one has, for example, the ring of quasi-symmetric power series\nQSymm ^ in countably many commuting variables over the integers and its subring\nQSymm\n\n(2.8)\n\nof quasi-symmetric polynomials in finite of countably many indeterminates, which are the\nquasi-symmetric power series of bounded degree. The notation is justified. The quasisymmetric\nfunctions in {x1, x 2 ,L} in this sense are a concrete realization of the quasisymmetric functions as\nintroduced above as the graded dual of NSymm.\nIn detail, given a word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] over N, also called a composition in this context,\nconsider the quasi-monomial function\nM\u03b1 =\n\n\u2211x\n\ni 1 <L <im\n\na1 a2\ni1 i 2\n\nx Lx iamm\n\n(2.9)\n\ndefined by \u03b1 . It is now an easy exercise to verify that as power series in the {x1, x 2 ,L} the M\u03b1\nsatisfy\nM\u03b1 M\u03b2 = M\u03b1 \u00d7osh \u03b2\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u00d7 osh is the overlapping shuffle product of words just defined above (2.6).\n3. NSymm and QSymm over a field of characteristic zero.\nLet K be a field of characteristic zero, in particular the field of rational numbers Q. The Hopf\nalgebras of noncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions over K are\ndenoted\nNSymmK = NSymm \u2297 Z K, QSymmK = QSymm \u2297Z K\n\n(3.1)\n\nAs remarked in the introduction, working over a field of characteristic zero tends to simplify\nthings considerably. Not that then everything becomes clear and easy and straightforward. Very\nfar from it; witness the many papers quoted in the introduction. However, it is certainly true, that\nfor the three groups of questions which form the main topic of this paper: primitives of\nnoncommutative symmetric functions, freeness of the algebra of quasisymmetric functions,\nexistence of Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms, things either reduce to known things, or\nbecome fairly straightforward. At least up to fairly explicitly given isomorphisms. And in that\nconnection it is well to reflect that knowing something well up to an isomorphism can be not all\nthe same as really controlling things.\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n6\n\nTo start with, consider another Hopf algebra over the integers, the Lie Hopf algebra\nU = Z U1,U2 ,L , \u03bc(Un ) =1\u2297 Un + U n \u2297 1, \u03b5(Un ) = 0, n = 1,2,L\n\n(3.2)\n\nThat is, as an algebra U is the free algebra over the integers in the noncommuting variables Un\nand the coalgebra structure is given by requiring that the two right hand formulas of (3.2) are\nalgebra homomorphisms.\nThe primitives of U are called Lie polynomials and they form the free Lie algebra over Z\nin the alphabet {U1,U2 ,L}. Also the universal enveloping algebra of Prim(U) is U.\nNow, over the rationals (and hence over any field of characteristic zero or ring containing\nQ) NSymm 1 and U are isomorphic. One particularly beautiful isomorphism\n\u03c6\nNSymmQ \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\n\u2192 UQ is given by setting\n1 + Z 1t + Z 2t 2 + Z3 t3 +L = exp(U1t +U2 t 2 + U3t 3 +L)\n\u221e\n\n= \u2211 (U 1t + U2t 2 + U3 t3 +L)i\n\n(3.3)\n\ni= 0\n\nwhere t is a (counting) variable commuting with everything in sight. Equating equal powers of\nt on the left and right hand sides of (3.3) gives\nZn =\n\n\u2211\n\ni1 +Lik =n\ni j \u2208N\n\nUi1Ui 2 LUik\nk!\n\n(3.4)\n\nFor a proof that the algebra isomorphism defined by setting \u03c6 (Zn ) equal to the right hand side\nof (3.4) defines an isomorphism of Hopf algebras see [18].\nThus, up to the isomorphism \u03c6 , the matter of describing Prim(NSymm), comes down to\ndescribing Prim(U), or, equivalently writing down some explicit bases for the free Lie algebra\ngenerated by a countable set of indeterminates {U1,U2 ,L}. The matter of constructing bases for\nfree Lie algebras has had a lot af attention. There are many more or less different bases such as\nHall bases, Shirshov bases, Lyndon bases, see [3, 39, 41, 42, 47].\nHere, partly because most of the concepts will be needed below anyway, is a description of\nthe Lyndon basis (also callled Chen - Fox - Lyndon basis).\nConsider the free monoid N\u2217 of words on the alphabet N (or any other totally ordered alphabet\nfor that matter). The lexicographic order (also called dictionary order, or alphabetical order) on\nN\u2217 is defined as follows. If \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] and \u03b2 = [b1,b2 ,L,bn ] are two words of length\nm and n respectively, lg(\u03b1) = m, lg( \u03b2) = n ,\n\uf8f1 \u2203k \u2264 min{m,n} such that a1 = b1 ,L,ak \u22121 = bk \u22121 and ak > bk\n\u03b1 > lex \u03b2 \u21d4 \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 or lg(\u03b1) = m > lg(\u03b2) = n and a1 = b1 ,L, an = bn\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe empty word is smaller than any other word. This defines a total order. Of course, if one\naccepts the dictum that anything is larger than nothing, the second clause of (3.5) is superfluous.\nThe proper tails (suffixes) of the word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] are the words\n[ai ,ai+1 ,Lam ], i = 2,3,L,m . Words of length 1 or 0 have no proper tails. The prefix\ncorresponding to a tail \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 = [ai ,ai +1 ,Lam ] is \u03b1 \u2032 = [a1,L,ai \u2212 1] so that \u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2032 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 where \u2217\n1\n\nThe Hopf algebra NSymm is sometimes called the Leibniz Hopf algebra.\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n7\n\ndenotes concatenation of words.\nA word is Lyndon iff it is lexicographically smaller than each of its proper tails. For\ninstance [4], [1,3,2], [1,2,1,3] are Lyndon and [1,2,1] and [2,1,3] are not Lyndon.\nFor each Lyndon word \u03b1 of length >1 consider the lexicographically smallest proper tail\n\u03b1 \u2032\u2032 of \u03b1 . Let \u03b1 \u2032 be the corresponding prefix to \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 . Then \u03b1 \u2032 and \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 are both Lyndon and\n\u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2032 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 is called the canonical factorization of \u03b1 .\nA basis of the free Lie algebra on {U1,U2 ,L}, i.e. a basis of Prim(U) \u2282 U , is now obtained as\nfollows. For each word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] let U\u03b1 = U a1 Ua2 LUa m be the corresponding\nmonomial. Now, by recursion in length, define for a word of length 1\nQ[i ] = Ui\n\n(3.6)\n\nand for \u03b1 Lyndon and of length lg(\u03b1) \u2265 2 let \u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2032 \u2217 \u03b1 \u2032\u2032 be its canonical factorization and\nset\nQ\u03b1 = [Q\u03b1 \u2032 ,Q\u03b1 \u2032\u2032 ]\n\n(3.7)\n\nthen the {Q\u03b1 : \u03b1 Lyndon} form a basis of Prim(U) \u2282 U . For a proof see e.g. [39], p. 105ff.\nThe next topic to be taken up is the matter of the freeness of QSymm over the rationals. The\ngraded dual of U is the socalled shuffle algebra. As a free module over Z it has the words over\nN as a basis and the product is the shuffle product which is like the overlapping shuffle product\nexcept that the overlap terms, i.e. those which involve additions of entries are left out. Thus for\nexample\n[a,b] \u00d7sh [c, d] = [a,b,c,d] +[a,c,b,d] +[a,c,d,b]+ [c,a,b, d] + [c,a,d,b] + [c,d, a,b]\n(compare (2.6) above).\nIt is well known that the shuffle algebra is free polynomial with as generators (for example)\nthe Lyndon words. See, for example, [39]. p. 111 for a proof. Thus via the isomorphism \u03c6 ,or\nrather its graded dual, it follows that QSymmQ is a free commutative algebra. But the\ndescription of the generators is rather involved and they do not look very nice. Actually the\nsituation is rather better and a modification of the proof of the freeness of the shuffle algebra\n(using a different ordering on words) gives that in fact QSymmQ is commutative free\npolynomial on the Lyndon words. The ordering to be used is the wll-ordering. The acronym\nstands for weight first, than length, than lexicographic. See [20] for details.\nThe third main topic of this survey is the existence of Frobenius and Verschiebung type Hopf\nalgebra endomorphisms of NSymm and QSymm which lift, respectively extend, those on\nSymm. Again, over the rationals, this is a relatively straightforward matter. Though there are\nsome unanswered questions.\nRecall the situation for Symm, see [17, 24] for more details.\nOn Symm there are two families of Hopf algebra endomorphims, called Frobenius and\nVerschiebung morphisms, denoted fn , vn , n \u2208N , which among others have the following\nbeautiful properties:\n(i) f1 = v1 = id\n(ii) fn is homogeneous of degree n, i.e. fn (Symmk ) \u2282 Symmnk\nHere, for any graded Hopf algebra, H, Hn is the homogeneous part of of weight n of H.\n(iii) v n is homogenous of degree n \u22121 , i.e. v n (Symmk ) \u2282 Symn \u22121k if n divides k,\nand v n (Symmk ) = 0 if n does not divide k.\n(iv) fn fm = fnm for all n,m \u2208N\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n8\n\n(v) v nv m = vnm for all n,m \u2208N\n(vi) fn v m = v mfn provided n and m are relatively prime, gcd(m,n) =1\n(vii) v nf n = n , where n is the n-fold convolution of the identiy.\nNow there is the natural projection\nNSymm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm, Zn a hn\n\n(3.8)\n\nand the natural (graded dual) inclusion\nSymm \u2282 QSymm\n\n(3.9)\n\nobtained by regarding a symmetric function as a special kind of quasisymmetric function. The\nquestion is whether there are lifts, respectively extensions, on NSymm, respectively QSymm,\nwhich also have the properties (i) - (vii).\nRetaining property (vii) can be ruled out immediately for trivial reasons. The simple fact is\nthat n on either Qsymm or NSymm simply is not a Hopf algebra endomorphism. So it is\nnatural to concentrate on the other six properties. And then the answer over the rationals is yes.\nBut, as will be stated below, the answer over the integers is no. But there are interesting\nsubstitutes.\nLet\npn = x1n + x n2 + x 3n L\n\n(3.10)\n\ndenote the power sums in Symm. They are related to the complete symmetric functions by the\nrecursion relation\nnhn = pn + pn\u22121 h1 + pn \u2212 2h2 +Lp1hn \u22121\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms on Symm are characterized by\n\uf8f1npk / n if n divides k\nfn pk = pnk , v n pk = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 if n does not divide k\n\n(3.12)\n\nOn the polynomial generators hn this characterization of v n works out as\n\uf8f1 hk / n if n divides k\nv nhk = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 0 otherwise\n\n(3.13)\n\nDefine the (noncommutative) Newton primitives in NSymm by\nPn (Z) =\n\n\u2211 (\u22121)\n\nk +1\n\nr1 +Lrk = n\n\nrk Zr1 Z r2 LZ rk , ri \u2208 N = {1,2,L}\n\n(3.14)\n\nor, equivalently, by the recursion relation\nnZn = Pn (Z) + Z1 Pn \u22121 (Z) + Z2Pn \u22122 (Z) +L+ Z n\u22121 P1(Z)\n\n(3.15)\n\nNote that under the projection Zn a hn by (3.15) and (3.11) Pn (Z) goes to pn . It is easily\nproved by induction, using (3.15), or directly from (3.14), that the Pn (Z) are primitives of\nNSymm, and it is also easy to see from (3.15) that over the rationals NSymm is the free\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n9\n\nassociative algebra generated by the Pn (Z) . Thus over the rationals the Lie algebra of primitives\nof NSymm is simply the free Lie algebra generated by the Pn (Z) , giving a second description of\nPrim( NSymmQ ) .\nThere are obvious candidate lifts of the v n on Symm to Hopf algebra endomorphisms on\nNSymm., viz\n\uf8f1Zk / n if k is divisible by n\nv n (Zk ) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 otherwise\n\n(3.16)\n\nBy (3.14) or (3.15) this implies\n\uf8f1nPk /n if n divides k\nv n (Pk ) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 otherwise\n\n(3.17)\n\nNow on NSymmQ define the Frobenius morphisms as the algebra morphisms given by\nfn (Pk (Z)) = Pnk (Z)\n\n(3.18)\n\nIt is now easily checked that the v n and fn as defined by (3.16) and (3.18) are Hopf algebra\nendomorphisms of NSymmQ , that they satisfy (the analogues on NSymmQ of) properties (i)-(vi)\nand that they descend to the usual Frobenius and Verschiebung morphisms on Symm.\nA priori, the fn as defined by (3.18) are only defined over the rationals and indeed\nnontrivial denominators show up almost immediately. For instance\nf2 (Z1) = 2Z2 \u2212 Z12\nf2 (Z2 ) = 2Z4 \u2212 32 Z1 Z3 \u2212 12 Z3 Z1 + Z22 + 21 Z1 Z2 Z1 + 21 Z12Z 2\n\n(3.19)\n\nOn Symm a certain amount of coefficient magic sees to it that all coefficients become integral.\nBut of course over Symm there are much better definitions of the Frobenius morphisms that\nimmediately show that they are defined over the integers, see [24] or [17], \u00a717.\nAs we shall see later, over the integers there are even no algebra endomorphisms fn of\nNSymm that lift the fn on Symm such that together with the v n as defined by (3.16) they\nsatisfy (i)-(vi).\nNote there is nothing unique about this solution (3.18) of the Frobenius-Verschiebung lifting\nproblem over the rationals. For instance one could work instead with the seond set of Newton\nprimitives defined by\nPn\u2032(Z ) =\n\n\u2211 (\u22121)\n\nk +1\n\nr1 +Lr k = n\n\nr1 Zr1 Zr2 LZr k , ri \u2208N = {1,2,L}\n\n(3.20)\n\nand satisfying the recursion relation\nnZn = Pn\u2032(Z) + Pn\u2032\u2212 1(Z)Z1 + Pn\u2032\u22122 (Z)Z2 +L+ P1\u2032(Z)Zn \u22121\n\n(3.20\n\n4. The primitives of NSymm.\nAbove, some primitives of NSymm were already written down and they generate a free graded\nLie algebra contained in Prim(NSymm). Denote this Lie algebra by FrLie(P) and its\nhomogeneous part of weight n by FrLie(P) n . The Lie algebra Prim(NSymm) is also graded\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n10\n\nof course. Let Prim( NSymm)n \u2282 NSymmn be the homogeneous part of degree n of\nPrim(NSymm). Both Prim( NSymm)n and FrLie(P) n are free Abelian groups of rank \u03b2n , the\nnumber of weight n Lyndon words 2. The index of FrLie(P) n \u2282 Prim(NSymm)n as a function\nof n measures how large FrLie(P) is in Prim(NSymm). As it turns out FrLie(P) is only a\ntiny part. Indeed, the value of the index alluded to is\nIndex of FrLie(P)n in Prim( NSymm)n =\n\n\u220f\n\n\u03b1 \u2208LYN, wt( \u03b1 )=n\n\nk(\u03b1 )\ng(\u03b1)\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere for a word \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] over the natural numbers g(\u03b1) is the gcd (greatest\ncommon divisor) of its entries a1,a2 ,L,am and k(\u03b1) is the product of its entries. Thus the\nvalues of (4.1) for the first six n are 1, 1, 2, 6, 576, 69120.\nThus taking iterated commutators of the known Newton primitives is not nearly good\nenough. One can see this coming very quickly. Indeed [P1,P2] = 2(Z1 Z2 \u2212 Z2 Z1 ) . It also follows\nthat Prim( NSymm) is not a free Lie algebra over the integers. Rather it tries to be something\nlike a free divided power Lie algebra (though I do not know what such a thing might be).\nInstead of taking commutators of primitives it turns out to be a good idea to work with whole\nDPS's (divided power sequences, see (1.8)). Accordingly, the next thing to be described are\ntechniques for producing new divided power sequences from known ones. There are two more\ntechniques for this (besides the ones mentioned in the introduction, which do not suffice) coming\nfrom two socalled isobaric decomposition theorems.\nFor the first isobaric decomposition theorem consider the Hopf algebra\n2NSymm = Z\u3008X1 ,Y1 , X2 ,Y2 ,L\u3009, \u03bc(Xn ) =\n\n\u2211X \u2297X ,\n\ni+ j = n\n\ni\n\nj\n\n\u03bc(Yn ) =\n\n\u2211 Y \u2297Y\n\ni+ j =n\n\ni\n\nj\n\n(4.2)\n\nand the two natural curves\nX(s) = 1+ X1s + X2 s 2 +L, Y(t ) = 1 +Y1 t + Y2 t 2 +L\n\n(4.3)\n\nand consider the commutator product\nX(s) \u22121 Y(t) \u22121 X(s)Y (t)\n\n(4.4)\n\nOn the set of pairs of nonnegative integers consider the ordering\n(u,v) <wl ( u\u2032 , v \u2032) \u21d4 u + v < u\u2032 + v\u2032 or (u + v = u \u2032 + v\u2032 and u < u \u2032)\n\n(4.5)\n\n(Here the index wl on <wl is supposed to be a mnemonic for weight first, then lexicographic.)\n4.6. Theorem (first bi-isobaric decomposition theorem, Shay [40], Ditters).

The only thing needed is to observe that pure powers of s or\nt do not occur on the LHS of (4.8) and that each pair of nonnegative integers (u,v) occurs just\nonce in one of the factors on the right 0f (4.8). That gives the decomposition. The fact that the\nfactors are two curves then follows easily with induction from the observation that the LHS of\n(4.8) is a 2-curve.\nAlso (4.8) implies an explicit recursion formula for the Lu ,v (X,Y).\n4.13.

The essential\nfact is that if d1,d2 are two divided power sequences in some Hopf algebra H, than so is\nDa ,b (d1, d2 ) = (1, La ,b (d1, d2 ), L2 a,2 b(d1 ,d2 ),L)\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere, as the notation suggests, Lu ,v (d1,d2 ) is obtained from the Lu ,v (X,Y) of theorem 4.6 by\nsubstituting d1(k) for X k and d2 (l) for Yl .

Theorem. The P\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208LYN form a basis over the integers of Prim(NSymm). Each\nof the P\u03b1 is the first term of a DPS.\nThe second property of theorem 4.23 guarantees that NSymm is the cofree cocommutative\ngraded coalgebra over the graded module Prim(NSymm), see the appendix of [22] for a proof of\n3\n\nThe operations on curves defined by (4.19) and (4.20) are functorial. Thus assigning to a Hopf algebra\nH its group of curves gives a group valued functor with many operations on it, viz 2-ary operations La, b for every\npair a,b with gcd(a,b)=1, and also unary operations Na, b for any such pair. In addition there are the operations\nwhich come from the Verschiebung Hopf algebra endomorphisms on NSymm (see section 6) which commute with\nthe La, b and Na, b . And then there are also Frobenius type operations (see also section 6). It is almost totally\nuninvestigated whether some subset of all this structure can be used for classification purposes, say, of\nnoncommutative formal groups.\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n13\n\nthat. It follows that the graded dual QSymm is a free commutative algebra, and implicitly\nspecifies a set of generators for QSymm. However, this does not give a convenient description\nof such a set of generators.\nThe original proof of theorem 4.23, [22], is rather long and intricate. Fortunately there is\nnow a much shorter proof, which will be discussed in the next section.\nThe basis P\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208LYN of Prim(NSymm) has a number of nice properties, particularly with\nrespect to the Verschiebung endomorphisms v n of NSymm, see (3.16).\nConsider the following ordering on words: \u03b1 < wll \u03b2 if and only if ( wt(\u03b1) < wt(\u03b2) or\n(wt(\u03b1) = wt(\u03b2) and lg(\u03b1) < lg \u03b2) ) or (wt(\u03b1) = wt(\u03b2) and lg(\u03b1) = lg \u03b2 ) and \u03b1 <lex \u03b2 )). The\nacronym 'wll' stands for 'weight first, than length, then lexicographic'.\n4.24. Theorem.

The second property\ncomes from the fact that the curves \u2211 Lra ,rb (X,Y)sra t rb and \u2211 Nra ,rb (Z)sra t rb of the two\nisobaric decomposition theorems 4.6 and 4.13 are particularly nice curves in that\n\uf8f1 Ln \u22121u ,n \u22121v (X,Y) if n divides u,v\nv n (Lu, v(X,Y)) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 otherwise\n\n(4.27)\n\n\uf8f1 N n\u2212 1u ,n\u2212 1v (Z) if n divides u,v\nv n (Nu, v (Z)) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 otherwise\n\n(4.28)\n\nwhere v n is defined on 2NSymm just like (3.16) for both the X's and the Y's.\n5. Free polynomial generators for QSymm over the integers.\nAs in section 2 above, consider Symm and QSymm as symmetric functions in an infinity of\nideterminates\nSymm = Z[e1 ,e2,L] \u2282 QSymm \u2282 Z[x1 , x2 ,L]\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the ei are the elementary symmetric functions in the x j .

It follows that QSymm and Symm have induced \u03bb \u2212 ring structures. On\nSymm this is of course the standard one.\nIt follows immediately from (5.5) that\nfn ([a1, a2 ,L,am ]) = [na1,na2 ,L,nam ]\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhen \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,L,am ] is seen as a monomial quasisymmetric function as in the realization of\nQSymm described in section 2.\nIt is more customary to denote the Adams operations (power operations) associated to a\n\u03bb -ring structure by \u03a8 's. However, in the present case they coincide with the Frobenius\nendomorphisms on Symm ([17], section E.2, p.144ff), and their natural extensions to QSymm;\nso it seems natural to use f 's instead in this case.\nFor any \u03bb \u2212 ring R there is an associated mapping\nSymm \u00d7 R\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R , (\u03c6, a) a \u03c6(\u03bb1 (a),\u03bb2 (a),L,\u03bbn (a),L)\n\n(5.9)\n\nI.e. write \u03c6 \u2208Symm as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions e1,e2,L and then\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n15\n\nsubstitute \u03bbi (a) for ei , i = 1,2,L. For a fixed a \u2208R this is obviously a homomorphism of\nrings Symm \uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 R. We shall often simply write \u03c6 (a) for \u03c6 (\u03bb1 (a),\u03bb2 (a),L,\u03bbn (a),L).\nAnother way to see (5.9) is to observe that for fixed a \u2208R (\u03c6, a) a \u03c6(\u03bb1 (a),\u03bb2 (a),L) = \u03c6(a) is\nthe unique homomorphism of \u03bb \u2212 rings that takes e1 into a. (Symm is the free \u03bb \u2212 ring on one\ngenerator, see also [27].) Note that\nen (\u03b1 ) = \u03bbn (\u03b1), pn (\u03b1) = fn (\u03b1) = [na1 ,na2,L,nam ]\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe first formula of (5.10) is by definition and the second follows from (5.7) because the\nrelations between the en and pn are precisely the same as between the \u03bbn (a) and the fn (a).\nNow let P \u2208NSymm be a primitive. Then, by duality\nP,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bc(P),\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 = 1\u2297 P + P \u22971,\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 = 0\nfor any words of length\n\n(5.11)\n\n1. Using the Newton relations\n\npn (\u03b1) = pn \u22121 (\u03b1)e1(\u03b1) \u2212 pn\u2212 2 (\u03b1 )e2 (\u03b1) + L(\u22121)n \u2212 2 p1 (\u03b1)en \u22121 (\u03b1) + (\u22121)n \u22121 nen (\u03b1)\n\n(5.12)\n\nit follows that for any primitive in NSymm\nP, pn (\u03b1 ) = \u00b1n P,en (\u03b1)\n\n(5.13)\n\nNow for any \u03b1 \u2208 LYN , \u03b1 = [a1,a2 ,Lam ] let \u03b1red = [g(\u03b1)\u22121 a1,g(\u03b1 ) \u22121 a2 ,L, g(\u03b1)\u22121 am ] and\ndefine\nE\u03b1 = eg ( \u03b1) (\u03b1 red )\n\n(5.14)\n\n5.15. Theorem. The E\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208LYN form a free polynomial basis of QSymm over the\nintegers\nFor a rather simple direct proof of this (based on Chen - Fox - Lyndon factorization, [4]), see\n[23].\nSometimes it is useful to relabel the E\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208LYN a bit. Let eLYN be the set of\nelementary Lyndon words, i.e those Lyndon words \u03b1 for which g(\u03b1) = 1. Then the\nen (\u03b1 ), \u03b1 \u2208eLYN, n = 1,2,3,L\n\n(5.16)\n\nare a sometimes convenient relabeling of the free polynomial basis E\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208LYN . Note that for\na fixed \u03b1 \u2208eLYN , the en (\u03b1 ) generate a subalgebra of QSymm that is isomorphic to Symm.\nNow, for all weights n, consider the matrices of integers\n\n( P ,E )\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1 ,\u03b2 \u2208LYN n\n\n(5.17)\n\nwhere LYNn is the set of Lyndon words of weight n and the columns and rows of (5.17) are\nordered by increasing wll-order.\nClaim: this matrix is diagonal with entries \u00b11 on the main diagonal. The triangularity\nfollows from theorem 4.24 (ii). As to the diagonal part:\n\n\fNoncommutative symmetric functions and quasisymmetric functions II\n\n16\n\ng(\u03b1) P\u03b1 , E\u03b1 = g(\u03b1 ) P\u03b1 ,\u03bb g( \u03b1) (\u03b1 red ) by definition\n= \u00b1 P\u03b1 , pg (\u03b1 ) (\u03b1red )\n= \u00b1 P\u03b1 ,\u03b1\n\nby (5.13)\n\nby (5.10)\n\n= \u00b1g(\u03b1) by (4.25)\nUsing that there are precisely \u03b2n =# LYNn P\u03b1 's and E\u03b1 's with \u03b1 of weight n, the\ninvertibility (over the integers) of the matrix (5.17) immediately implies both that the P\u03b1 are a\nbasis of Prim(NSymm) and that the E\u03b1 are a free polynomial basis for QSymm over the\nintegers\n6. Frobenius and Verschiebung on NSymm and QSymm.\nTo fix notations let\nfnSymm and v Symm\nn\nbe the classical Frobenius and Verschiebung Hopf algebra endomorphisms over the integers of\nSymm, characterized by\n\uf8f1 npk/ n if n divides k\nfnSymm (pk ) = pnk , v nSymm (pk ) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 0 otherwise\n\n(6.1)\n\nNow NSymm comes with a canonical projection NSymm\uf8e7\n\uf8e7\u2192 Symm, Zn a hn and there is the\ninclusion Symm \u2282 QSymm (see section 2).

These two families are so natural and beautiful that nothing better can\nbe expected and in the following these are fixed as the Verschiebung morphisms on NSymm\nand Frobenius morphisms on QSymm. They are also dual to each other.\nThe question to be examined in this section is whether there are supplementary families of\nmorphisms fn on NSymm, respectively v n on QSymm, such that (6.2) holds. The first result is\nnegative\n6.6. Theorem. There are no (Verschiebung-like) coalgebra endomorphisms v n of QSymm\nthat extend the v n on Symm, such that parts (iii)-(vi) of (6.2) hold. Dually there are no\n(Frobenius-like) algebra homomorphisms of NSymm that lift the fn on Symm such that parts\n(i)-(iv) of (6.2) hold.\nIt is the coalgebra morphism property which makes it difficult for (6.2) (iii)-(vi) to hold. It is not\nparticularly difficult to find algebra endomorphisms of QSymm that do the job. For instance\ndefine the v n on QSymm as the algebra endomorphisms given on the generators (5.16) by\n\uf8f1ek / n(\u03b1) if n divides k\nv n (ek (\u03b1 )) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f30 otherwise\n\n(6.6)\n\nIt then follows from (5.12) that\n\uf8f1npk / n (\u03b1) if n divides k\nv n ( pk(\u03b1 )) = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3 0 otherwise\n\n(6.7)\n\nand all the properties (6.2) follow.\nThe last topic I would like to discuss is whether there are Hopf algebra endomorphisms of\nQSymm (and dually, NSymm) such that some weaker versions of (6.2) hold.\nTo this end we first discuss a filtration by Hopf subalgebras of QSymm.

Note that this does not mean that the elements of Fi (QSymm) are bounded in length.
