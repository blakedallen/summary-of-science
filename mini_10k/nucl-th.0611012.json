Despite these systems are rather simple\nthe study of two-particle bound states is challenging and still remains a source of progress in\nquantum theory. Last decade significant efforts were undertaken to describe such objects,\nand progress has been achieved in both, solving the corresponding equations [1]-[5] and\ncalculating the experimentally measured observables [6]-[10].\nThe homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation nowadays remains a powerful tool to\ninvestigate the relativistic bound state problem. Recently the problem of rigorous treating\nthe BS equations received renewed interest, and several successful attempts were made to\nreconsider solving algorithms for the BS equation [11] and to make its reduction to Light\nFront form more transparent [4]. A good example of a consistent study of this subject can\nbe found in Ref. [12].\nIn fact, our understanding of the mathematical properties of bound states within any\nrelativistic approach is far from perfection. The BS equation itself is a quite complicated\nmathematical object, and the technical problem of solving it is still of principal value. In\nthe present paper we propose an efficient and promising method to solve the BS equation\nfor fermions involving interaction kernels in the form of one boson exchange supplemented\nwith the corresponding form factors. It is based on employing the basis of hyperspherical\nharmonics for expanding the partial amplitudes and kernels. We show that this new technique allows one to utilize many advantages in understanding the BS approach. Basically,\nthe current study is inspired by the results reported in [3]. We explore the structure of 0+\nand 1+ bound states for different couplings studying in details the convergence of solutions\nand corresponding eigenvalues. In particular, on a basis of the introduced rigorous method\nto solve the BS equation it becomes possible to analyze in details the problem of stability\nof bound states within the BS approach. It is worth mentioning that this phenomenon\nwas also considered in [3] in the framework of Light-Front Dynamics, and it is completely\nsimilar to the bound state collapse in non relativistic quantum mechanics for potentials\nbehaving like \u223c 1/r 2 .\n\n2\n\nHomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation for fermions\n\nIn the present study, we generalize the method described in [11, 13, 14] to homogeneous BS\nequations for spinor particles. To provide a clear illustration, we present here the results of\n1\n\n\fsolving the equation for the vertex function\nG(p) = i\n\nd4 k\nV (p, k) \u0393(1) S(k1) G(k) S\u0303(k2 ) \u0393\u0303(2)\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\nin the 1 S0 channel with V (p, k) = g 2 /[(p \u2212 k)2 \u2212 \u03bc2 + i\u03b5] as one meson exchange interaction\nkernel for scalar, pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges with corresponding vertices\n\u0393(i), i = 1, 2. The meaning of the introduced quantities p, k, k1 , k2 is the following: k1,2 =\nP/2 \u00b1 k, k = (k0 , k), p = (p0 , p) are the relative 4-momenta, and P = (M, 0) is the total\n4-momentum of the bound state in its c.m.s. Spinor propagators of constituent particles\nwith equal masses m are\nS(k) =\n\nk2\n\nk\u0302 + m\n,\n\u2212 m2 + i\u03b5\n\nS\u0303(k) \u2261 CS(k)T C =\n\nk2\n\nk\u0302 \u2212 m\n,\n\u2212 m2 + i\u03b5\n\nwith C standing for charge conjugation matrix, C = i\u03b30 \u03b32 , k\u0302 = \u03b3\u03bc k \u03bc . In general, the\nvertices include the meson-nucleon form factor, which will be further considered as\nF (q 2 ) =\n\n\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bc2\n.\n\u039b2 \u2212 q 2\n\n(2)\n\nIn (1) the BS vertex function G(p) being the matrix 4 \u00d7 4 should be expanded over the\nproper set of matrices for the given channel. The standard choice for them is the set of\nthe \u03c1-spin angular momentum vector harmonics \u0393\u03b1 (p), where index \u03b1 includes not only\nLSJ momenta but also \u03c1\u2013spin quantum numbers, which are denoted by ++,\u2212\u2212, e and o\n[15]. For convenience in our further considerations we introduce another equivalent set of\nspin-angular matrices instead of \u03c1-spin basis. For 1 S0 channel the following functions may\nbe chosen:\n1\nT2 (p) = \u03b30 \u03b35 ,\n2\n\n1\nT1 (p) = \u03b35 ,\n2\n\nT3 (p) = \u2212\n\n(p, \u03b3)\n\u03b30 \u03b35 ,\n2|p|\n\nT4 (p) = \u2212\n\n(p, \u03b3)\n\u03b35 .\n2|p|\n\n(3)\n\nThis basis is orthonormal, i.e.\nZ\n\nd\u03a9p T r [Tm (p)Tn+ (p)] = \u03b4mn ,\n\nand the partial expansion can be written as\nG(p0 , p) =\n\nX\n\ngn (p0 , |p|) Tn (p),\n\ngn (p0 , |p|) =\n\nn\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a9p T r [G(p0 , p)Tn+ (p)].\n\n(4)\n\nAfter the partial expansion and upon performing the Wick rotation we can expand the\npartial vertex functions gn and the partial interaction kernels in hyperspherical functions\nusing the formula [11]\nVE (p, k) = \u2212\n\nX 1\n1\n2\n\u2217\n=\n\u22122\u03c0\nVn (p\u0303, k\u0303)Znlm (\u03c9p )Znlm\n(\u03c9k ),\n2\n(p \u2212 k)E + \u03bc2\nn\n+\n1\nnlm\n\n4\nVn (a, b) =\n(\u039b+ + \u039b\u2212 )2\n\n\u039b+ \u2212 \u039b\u2212\n\u039b+ + \u039b\u2212\n\n!n\n\nq\n\n,\n\n\u039b\u00b1 =\n\n(5)\n\nq\n\n(a \u00b1 b)2 + \u03bc2 ,\n\nwhere (k, p)E \u2261 k4 p4 + (k, p), k\u0303 = k42 + k2 is the 4-dimensional absolute value, and\n\u03c9k = (\u03c7, \u03b8, \u03c6) are the angles of vector k = (k4 , k) in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

This system will be explicitly shown and discussed in details separately [16]. What is important now, is that its numerical analysis does\nnot require large computer resources. This set can be easily transformed to the system of\nlinear equations. For this aim, firstly, the infinite summation over hyperspherical components should be limited to some finite value Nmax . Secondly, to calculate the integrals a\nreliable integration scheme is required.

For 0+ (1+ )\nstate we have Nc = 4 (Nc = 8). The matrix A is obtained as a product of partial kernels,\nthe Jakobian of the transition to the new variables, the weights of the Gaussian mesh etc.\nThe dimension of A is N \u00d7 N, where N = Nc NG Nmax .\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nIn this short communication we are able to present only the most indicative results of\nthe numerical treatment of the BS equations within our method.

This condition allows us to connect\nthe coupling constant g 2 and the mass of bound state M, i.e. for any given value of g 2 the\nmass M can be calculated, and vice versa. The results of such calculation for \u03b1 = g 2/4\u03c0 are\nshown in Fig. 1 for the case of scalar meson exchange. The solid curve corresponds to our\ncalculations in the BS approach, dashed curve represents the results obtained within Light\nFront Dynamics [3], dotted one \u2013 nonrelativistic calculations for the Yukawa potential.\nThe spectrum of bound states obtained in this way demonstrates the customary nonrelativistic features. Together with the ground states, the exited levels of the system can be\nfound (for an alternative method of calculation see e.g. Ref. [17]). Like in the nonrelativistic\npicture, solutions of the ground states (i.e. set of partial vertex functions g1 , . . . , g4) do not\nhave nodes in |p| whereas the excited levels are described by vertex functions having zeroes.\nBesides, for any given mass of exchanged meson \u03bc the bound state (at the ground level)\ncan appear in the considered system only starting from some finite value of the coupling\n2\n2\nconstant gmin\n. For example, at \u03bc = 0.15 GeV we have gmin\n= 4.023, which corresponds to\nsome minimal depth of the potential, where the bound state still exists.\nIt is obvious, that for weakly bound states for the fixed binding energies B of order\nof a few MeV coupling constants are approximately equal. Thus, for the value B = 1\nMeV \u03b1BS = 0.362, and \u03b1LF D = 0.331. But for B of order of hundreds MeV coupling\nconstants essentially differ. For example, for the value B = 100 MeV we have the ratio\n\u03b1BS /\u03b1LF D \u223c 1.3. The explanation of such a behaviour we found in the role of 1 S0\u2212\u2212\ncomponent in the total BS solution. It is seen from the Table 1 that its contribution to\nthe normalization condition is negligibly small for weakly bound states but increases very\nrapidly with the increasing B, in contrast to the contributions of other partial states. Thus,\nthe role of the 1 S0\u2212\u2212 component is repulsive, which leads to an increasing coupling constant\nfor the same bound mass M in comparison with the nonrelativistic or LFD formalisms,\nwhere \u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u2212\u2032\u2032 components are absent.\nAnother important question to be touched upon is the problem of stability of the bound\nstates within the BS approach. In the present context stability means the existence of the\nsolutions in (1) without any cut off in the vertices. In its turn, such a solution exists only if\n4\n\n\f2,0\n\n2,0\n2\n\ng =30\n\n2\n\ng =20\n\n2\n\ng =40\n\n1,6\n\n1,6\n\n2\n\ng =60\n\ng =42\n\nM, GeV\n\nM, GeV\n\n2\n\n1,2\n2\n\ng =45\n\n0,8\n\n2\n\ng =65\n\n1,2\n\n2\n\ng =70\n\n0,8\n\n2\n\ng =73\n\n2\n\ng =48\n\n0,4\n\n0,4\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n\u039b,\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nGeV/c\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n, GeV/c\n\nFigure 3: Masses of bound states in 1 S0 chan- Figure 4: Masses of bound states in 3 S1 -3 D1\nnel as functions of cut-off parameter \u039b.\nchannel as functions of cut-off parameter \u039b.\nit does not depend on the parameters of calculation like Nmax , NG , etc. In general, we found\nthat convergence of our method is quite rapid, and it becomes faster for smaller values of\nthe coupling constant. In particular, in the 1 S0 channel of the scalar meson exchange kernel\nit is sufficient to take into account Nmax \u223c 4 \u2212 5 terms in (6)-(7) for the values of meson\nmass \u03bc > 0.1 GeV and coupling constant g 2 < 40. In the direct calculations it also appears,\nthat the Gaussian mesh with NG = 64 is almost always enough, since an increase of NG\nbeyond this value practically does not change the results.\nNevertheless, it should be pointed out that at certain conditions convergence of the\nsolutions becomes poor or even breaks. In particular, it is lost at small meson masses \u03bc \u223c 0,\nand similar behaviour was found in [11] for the bound states of scalar particles. In this case,\nthe introduction of form factors allows one to improve the situation. However, in total, we\nfound that in general the equation (1) has stable solutions only for coupling constants g 2\n2\nbelow some critical value gcr\n, which depends on the type of interaction and the channel\nconsidered. It can be found from the numerical calculations, since at coupling constants\nabove some critical value the solution disappears, i.e. it becomes strongly dependent on\nNmax , NG and other numerical parameters.\nTo find the critical value of the coupling constant the dependence of the ground state\nmass on the cut-off parameter \u039b at fixed g 2 have been investigated. The obtained results\nare presented in Figs. 3 and 4 for 1 S0 and 3 S1 -3 D1 channels respectively. It is evident\nthat in the limit \u039b \u2192 \u221e and coupling constants g 2 < 40 the 1 S0 bound state mass does\nnot depend on \u039b. The same is valid for solutions (vertex functions). More exactly, the\n2\ncritical constant gcr\nfor 1 S0 state is found to be 40.3. Theoretical estimation of the critical\n2\ncoupling constant can also be performed, and it gives the value gcr\n= 4\u03c0 2 \u2248 40. As it is\nseen from Fig. 4, the similar situation holds for the 3 S1 -3 D1 channel, where the critical\n2\nvalue is gcr\n\u2248 65.\nIt can also be shown that g 2 is directly connected to the power of decrease of vertex\nfunctions at large p, which is shown at Fig. 2. The solid line there corresponds to the\nsolution below gcr with finite normalization, and the dashed one reproduces the solution\nbeyond critical coupling, which seems to have infinite normalization.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nConclusion and acknowledgements\n\nA new method of solving the BS equations for the bound states of spinor particles by\nusing the expansion of the vertex functions over the complete set of four-dimensional hyperspherical harmonics is suggested. Within this method the BS equation is treated in a\nladder approximation for the cases of scalar, pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges with\ncorresponding form factors. This method is shown to be effective and stable.\nWe are grateful to V.A. Karmanov for valuable discussions concerning the problem of\nstability.
