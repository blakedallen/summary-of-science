It is usually assumed that black hole solutions are the models of\nBHCs. Nevertheless there are various nonvacuum solutions in general relativity that are being studied as alternatives to black holes, sometimes called black hole mimickers. Among such alternative solutions are wormholes\n[1, 2], gravastars [1, 3\u20135], brane world solutions [6] and\nboson stars [7\u201310]. Predictions on phenomena related to\nblack hole mimickers are important, either because they\nmay rule out the mimicker or at least restrict the parameter space of mimicker configurations.\nOne of the most important properties of mimickers is\nthe stability. For wormhole solutions instability has been\nshown for basic wormhole solutions [11\u201314], destroying\nprevious hope on the possibility that these are stable\nas shown in [15]. The stability of gravastars has been\nexplored and it has been found that there are stability\nregions [3, 16\u201318]. In favor of boson stars the stability of the solutions has been exhaustively studied, using\nperturbative methods [19, 20] and using full nonlinear\nnumerical relativity, both in spherical symmetry [21, 22]\nand full three dimensions [23].\nIn the particular case of boson stars they have been\nstudied as sources of gravitational radiation, both as binary systems [24] and as perturbed boson stars [25] in the\nfull nonlinear regime. The study of gravitational wave\nsignatures has also been pursued in order to differentiate\nbetween a black hole and a gravastar [4]. Instead, in the\ncase of wormholes for example, simple solutions (supported by a phantom scalar field) would not stand the\nperturbative analysis and there is no hope for a study of\na binary system, because as shown in [13] the lifetime of\nthese solutions is rather short and they should either collapse and form black holes or explode before they could\nmerge (although in [14] it was shown that charged wormholes can have a longer lifetime if the charge parameter\nis adequately chosen). At the end of the day, if black\n\nhole mimickers are to be compared from all the angles\nwith black holes, mimickers should also be expected to\ndo what black holes can do: they collide and generate\ngravitational radiation with a given fingerprint.\nIn this paper we explore a simple but potentially fruitful problem: the evolution of a test massless scalar field\non the space-time of boson stars. It is well known that, in\nthe case of black holes, the solution of such an equation\nis related to the quasinormal modes of axial perturbations and electromagnetic test fields [26]. And even if\nthis equation is not the perturbation equation of boson\nstars (it would involve the perturbation of matter too)\nthe behavior of the massless scalar field would provide\nindications on which boson stars look more like black\nholes, among the big set of boson stars that are mimickers\nwhen the power emitted by accretion disks are compared\nto those due to black holes [9, 10]. We calculate the numerical solution for various boson star space-times and\ncompare to the solution for the space-time corresponding\nto a Schwarzschild black hole. We track the numerical\nsolution at the level of mode ringing and tail decay.\nOne of the important ingredients of this paper is that\nwe foliate our space-times with hyperboloidal slices, for\nwhich we develop the procedure to foliate a static spherically symmetric space-time with constant mean curvature slices. Following [27, 28], we compactify the boundary at J + (future null infinity) which allows one to measure the amplitude of the scalar field at almost arbitrary\ndistances from the source. The compactification of future\nnull infinity implies the physical metric to be singular at\ninfinity; this problem is fixed using a rescaling through\na conformal transformation [27]. Therefore, in order to\nachieve correct physical results, we solve the conformally\ninvariant wave equation. We proceed in this manner because we are interested in measuring the scalar field far\nfrom the source and at infinity; in this case it is natural\nto consider future null infinity as the boundary because it\nis the asymptotic boundary of a scalar field propagating\nat the speed of light.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we de-\n\n\f2\nscribe the construction of boson star space-times. In Sec.\nIII we develop the process of conformal compactification\nfor a spherically symmetric space-time, that we apply to\nthe Schwarzschild and boson star space-times. In Sec.\nIV we present the solution of a massless scalar field on\nthese space-times and compare the behavior by solving\nthe conformally invariant wave equation. Finally in Sec.\nV we present some conclusions.\nII.\n\nBOSON STARS\n\nBoson stars (BSs) arise from the Lagrangian density of\na complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, that\nis,\n\nL=\u2212\n\nR\n+ g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2217 \u2202\u03bd \u03a6 + V (|\u03a6|2 ),\n\u03ba0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03ba0 = 16\u03c0G in units where c = 1, \u03a6 is the scalar\nfield, the star stands for complex conjugate, and V the\npotential of self-interaction of the field [29, 30]. Notice\nthat this Lagrangian density is invariant under the global\nU (1) group, and the associated conserved charge is the\nquantity called the number of particles (defined below).\nWhen the action is varied with respect to the metric, Einstein's equations arise G\u03bc\u03bd = \u03ba0 T\u03bc\u03bd , where the resulting\nstress-energy tensor reads\n1\n1\n[\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2217 \u2202\u03bd \u03a6+\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2202\u03bd \u03a6\u2217 ]\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd [\u03a6\u2217,\u03b1 \u03a6,\u03b1 +V (|\u03a6|2 )].\n2\n2\n(2)\nBoson stars are related to the potential V = m2 |\u03a6|2 +\n\u03bb\n4\n2 |\u03a6| . The quantity m is understood as the mass of a boson and \u03bb is the coefficient of a two-body self-interaction\nmean field approximation. The Bianchi identity reduces\nto the Klein-Gordon equation\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0013\ndV\n\u03a6 = 0,\n(3)\n\u2737\u2212\nd|\u03a6|2\n\u221a\nwhere \u2737\u03a6 = \u221a1\u2212g \u2202\u03bc [ \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6].\nBoson stars are spherically symmetric solutions to the\nabove set of equations under a particular condition: the\nscalar field has harmonic time dependence \u03a6(r, t) =\n\u03c60 (r)e\u2212i\u03c9t , where r is the radial spherical coordinate.\nThis condition implies that the stress-energy tensor in\n(2) is time-independent, which implies through Einstein's\nequations that the geometry is also time-independent.\nThat is, there is a time-dependent scalar field oscillating\nupon a time-independent geometry whose source is the\nscalar field itself. It is possible to construct solutions for\nboson stars assuming that the metric can be written in\nnormal coordinates as\n\u0012\n\nds2 = \u2212\u03b1(r)2 dt2 + a(r)2 dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 .\n\n(4)\n\nFor these coordinates the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system\nof equations reads:\n\u2202r a\n1 \u2212 a2\n=\n+\na\n2r \u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1 2\n1\n2\n2 2\n2\n2 2a\n\u03ba0 r \u03c9 \u03c60 2 + (\u2202r \u03c60 ) + a \u03c60 (m + \u03bb\u03c60 ) ,\n4\n\u03b1\n2\n\u2202r \u03b1\na2 \u2212 1 \u2202r a 1\n1\n=\n+\n\u2212 \u03ba0 ra2 \u03c620 (m2 + \u03bb\u03c620 ),\n\u03b1\nr \u0012\na\n2\n2\n\u0013\na2\n2 \u2202r \u03b1 \u2202r a\n2\n+ \u03c9 \u03c60 2\n+\n\u2212\n\u2202rr \u03c60 + \u2202r \u03c60\nr\n\u03b1\na\n\u03b1\n\u2212 a2 (m2 + \u03bb\u03c620 )\u03c60 = 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThe system (5) is a set of coupled ordinary differential\nequations to be solved under the conditions of spatial flatness at the origin a(0) = 1, \u03c60 (0) finite and \u2202r \u03c60 (0) = 0\nin order to guarantee regularity and spatial flatness at the\norigin, and \u03c60 (\u221e) = 0 in order to ensure asymptotic flatness at infinity as described in [19, 21, 22, 31]; these conditions reduce the system (5) to an eigenvalue problem for\n\u03c9, that is, for every central value of \u03c60 there is a unique\n\u03c9 with which the boundary conditions are satisfied. In\npractice the system of equations is not integrated up to\ninfinity, instead the solution is calculated up to a large\nvalue of r where the boundary conditions are satisfied\nwith a given tolerance. Because the system (5) contains\nseveral constants, it is convenient to rescale the variables\nin such a way that they do not appear. In order to\npdo so,\nthe following transformation is convenient: \u03c6\u03020 = \u03ba20 \u03c60 ,\n2\u03bb\nr\u0302 = mr, t\u0302 = \u03c9t, \u03b1\u0302 = m\n\u03c9 \u03b1 and \u039b = \u03ba0 m2 [22]. The result\nis that the physical constants vanish from the equations\nand the radial coordinate has units of m and the time has\nunits of \u03c9. In fact the mass of the boson becomes the\nparameter that fixes the scale of the system. After substituting this transformation and removing the tildes from\neverywhere, the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon system\nof equations reads:\n\u2202r a\n1 \u2212 a2\n=\n+\na\n2r\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1\n1 4\n2\n2 2\n2a\nr \u03c60 2 + (\u2202r \u03c60 ) + a (\u03c60 + \u039b\u03c60 ) ,\n2\n\u03b1\n2\na2 \u2212 1 \u2202r a\n1\n\u2202r \u03b1\n=\n+\n\u2212 ra2 \u03c620 (1 + \u039b\u03c620 ),\n\u03b1\nr \u0012\na\n\u0013 2 2\n2 \u2202r \u03b1 \u2202r a\na\n\u2202rr \u03c60 + \u2202r \u03c60\n+ \u03c60 2\n+\n\u2212\nr\n\u03b1\na\n\u03b1\n\u2212 a2 (1 + \u039b\u03c620 )\u03c60 = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nNotice that the parameter \u03c9 now turns into the central\nvalue of the lapse \u03b1 due to the rescaling. This is the\nsystem that is being solved in practice using finite differences with an ordinary integrator (adaptive step-size\nfourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm in the present case)\nand a shooting routine that bisects the value of \u03c9.\n\n\f3\n1.6\n\n4\n\n1.4\n\n5\n\n1.2\n\n2\n\nM (Mpl /m)\n\nIII.\n\n\u039b=0\n\u039b = 20\nCritical point\nEB=0\nStable\nUnstable to BH\nUnstable explode\n\n1\n\n6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n\u03c60(0)\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFIG. 1: Sequences of equilibrium configurations for two values of \u039b are shown as a function of the central value of the\nscalar field \u03c60 (0); each point in the curves corresponds to a\nsolution of the eigenvalue problem and represents a boson star\nconfiguration.

In\neach of the curves two important points for each value\nof \u039b are marked: (i) the critical point, marked with a\nfilled circle, indicating the threshold between the stable\nand unstable branches of each sequence (that is, configurations to the left of this point are stable and those\nto the right are unstable) as found through the analysis of perturbations [19] and full nonlinear evolution of\nthe equilibrium solutions [21\u201323]; and (ii) the point at\nwhich the binding energy EB = M \u2212 N m = 0 marked\nwith an inverted filled triangle (see [19] forR this convention\nwhere N = j 0 d3 x =\nR i \u221a of\u03bc\u03bdthe\u2217 binding energy),\n\u2217 3\n2 \u2212gg [\u03a6 \u2202\u03bd \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u2202\u03bd \u03a6 ]d x is the number of particles; that is, the conserved quantity due to the invariance\nunder the global U (1) group of the Lagrangian density\n(1). M = (1 \u2212 1/a2)r/2 evaluated at the outermost point\nof the numerical domain is our best guess of the ArnowittDeser-Misner (ADM) mass [22]; the configurations between the instability threshold and the zero binding energy point (like configurations 2 and 5) have negative\nbinding energy (EB < 0) and collapse into black holes\nwhereas those to the right (like 3 and 6) have positive\nbinding energy and disperse away. Those configurations\nto the left of the threshold of instability like 1 and 4,\nthat is, stable configurations, possess a negative binding\nenergy. Boson stars as black hole mimickers are located\nin the stable branch [9, 10], and that is why in this paper\nwe only consider stable configurations.\n\nSCRI-FIXING CONFORMAL\nCOMPACTIFICATION\n\nWe want to solve for a test scalar field on a fixed\nbackground geometry corresponding to a boson star and\ncompare it with the one calculated on a Schwarzschild\nbackground. For this we choose hyperboloidal slices that\nshow important advantages. At present time, foliations\nwith boundaries at future null infinity are being used\nfor various applications, like the solution of perturbation\nequations [32\u201334] and the study of tails [35]. On the\nother hand, hyperboloidal foliations are useful because\nthey reach future null infinity and for asymptotically flat\nspace-times, the gravitational radiation and scalar field\nglobal properties are well defined at such a boundary\n[36, 37]. On the other hand, it is possible to compactify\nthe space-time in order to work on a numerical domain\nthat contains J + , for which it is necessary to compactify\nthe spatial coordinates in an appropriate way such that\nthe space-time is regular there, at future null infinity.\nUsually, when a spatial coordinate is being compactified, the metric is singular at the new spatial infinity,\nand the same happens when hyperboloidal slices are compactified. Among others [38, 39], a known way of fixing\nthis problem is the definition of a conformal metric that\nuses an ad hoc conformal factor that regularizes the singular terms resulting from the compactification [27, 38].\nThe idea behind scri-fixing conformal compactification\nfor spherically symmetric space-times is the following:\n(i) use hyperboloidal foliations whose slices reach J + ,\n(ii) compactify the radial coordinate and (iii) regularize\nthe metric with an appropriate conformal factor. In order to proceed, a new time coordinate is introduced as\nt = t\u0303 \u2212 h(r\u0303), where (t\u0303, r\u0303) are the original time and space\ncoordinates and h(r\u0303) is a function called the height function [27, 38, 40]. This last transformation has the advantage that it keeps the time direction invariant. That is,\nregardless of the choice of the h(r\u0303), the timelike Killing\nvector has the same form in both coordinate systems.\nA compactifying coordinate is introduced in the form\nr\u0303 = \u03a9r , where \u03a9 = \u03a9(r) is a function that compactifies r and at the same time is a non-negative conformal\nfactor that vanishes at J + [27]; in our case we choose\n\u03a9 = 1 \u2212 r for the black holes and \u03a9 = (1 \u2212 r2 )/2 for BSs.\nThen J + is located at r = 1, where the space-time can\nbe rescaled g = \u03a92 g\u0303 with the conformal factor so that\nthe conformal metric g is regular everywhere.\nOn the other hand, for the construction of h(r\u0303), constant mean curvature slices are used [40]. The mean extrinsic curvature k\u0303 of the initial slice t = 0 is given by\n[40]\n\u221a\n1\nk\u0303 = \u2207\u03bc n\u03bc = \u221a \u2202\u03bc ( \u2212gn\u03bc ),\n\u2212g\n\n(7)\n\nwhere n\u03bc is a timelike unit vector normal to the spatial\nhypersurface and positive k\u0303 means that the slices reach\nfuture null infinity. In this paper, we adopt the condition\n\n\f4\nthat the mean extrinsic curvature k\u0303 is constant. Such\ncondition allows the integration of the equation above.\nWe now develop the construction of the conformal compactification for a spherically symmetric space-time described by the type of metric we start up in the cases\nstudied here (Schwarzschild and the boson star):\nds\u03032 = \u2212\u03b12 (r\u0303)dt\u03032 + a2 (r\u0303)dr\u03032 + r\u03032 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ), (8)\nwhere a and \u03b1 are assumed to be known metric functions,\nand we proceed to construct a hyperboloidal foliation and\na scri-fixing compactification.\nBy introducing the change of coordinate t = t\u0303 \u2212 h(r\u0303)\nthe line element takes the form\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nds\u0303 = \u2212\u03b1 (r\u0303)dt \u2212 2h (r\u0303)\u03b1 (r\u0303)dtdr\u0303\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ a2 (r\u0303) \u2212 \u03b12 (r\u0303)(h\u2032 (r\u0303))2 dr\u03032 + r\u03032 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62(9)\n),\n\nwhere h\u2032 = dh\ndr\u0303 .

The space-time using scri-fixing conformal\ncompactification is finally given by the line element\nds2 = \u2212\u03b12 (r)\u03a92 (r)dt2 \u2212 2h\u2032 (r)\u03b12 (r)(\u03a9 \u2212 r\u03a9\u2032 )dtdr\n\u0003\n\u0002\ndr2\n+ a2 (r) \u2212 \u03b12 (r)(h\u2032 (r))2 (\u03a9 \u2212 r\u03a9\u2032 )2 2\n\u03a9 (r)\n\n+r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the functions \u03b1(r), a(r) and h\u2032 (r) are the functions\n\u03b1(r\u0303), a(r\u0303) and h\u2032 (r\u0303) evaluated in r\u0303 = r\u0303(r). The conformal\nfactor \u03a9 determines various properties of the resulting\nconformal metric.\nThe two cases we study here correspond to the\nSchwarzschild and the boson star space-times. In the\nfirst case, \u03b12 = a12 = (1 \u2212 2M\nr\u0303 ), with which our expression (14), using \u03a9 = 1 \u2212 r, is reduced to the expression\nfor h\u2032 (r\u0303) obtained by Malec and Murchadha [40], and the\nfinal version of the conformally rescaled metric reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2(k\u0303r3 /3 \u2212 C\u03a93 )\n2M \u03a9\n\u03a92 dt2 \u2212\ndtdr\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\nr\nP (r)\nr4\n+ 2 dr2 + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\n(17)\nP (r)\nwhere\n\nGiven a spacelike slice, we can drag it along the timelike Killing vector. This will give a slicing where the time\ntranslation is along the Killing vector. Now, the mean\ncurvature at the initial time slice, given by (7), takes the\nform\n\u0014\n\nand\n\n(14)\n\nv\n!2 \u0012\nu\n\u0013\nu k\u0303r3\n2M \u03a9\nt\n3\n3\nP (r) = \u03a9 P\u0303 (r) =\n+ 1\u2212\n\u2212 C\u03a9\n\u03a92 r 4 .\n3\nr\n\n(18)\nThe values of k\u0303 and the integration constant C are restricted such that P (r) is real. The values of these constants used in this paper are k\u0303 = 0.4 and C = 2 in all\nour calculations for the black hole.\nIn the Boson Star case: (i) we solve the eigenvalue\nproblem (6) for a given configuration with a given ADM\nmass; (ii) since such solution is only calculated up to a\nfinite -but large- radius, we match the solution to the\nSchwarzschild solution; (iii) then we foliate the resulting\nsolution using hyperboloidal slices with constant mean\ncurvature using (14); and (iv) finally we construct a conformal metric that contains a compactified spatial coordinate with the values k\u0303 = 3 and C = 0, which we have\nfound to be useful for space-times without horizons.\n\n\f5\nSince boson star space-times are regular everywhere\nand since we solve the conformally invariant wave equation where the Ricci scalar gets involved, it is useful\nto use an adequate conformal factor that allows such\nscalar to be regular at the origin. Following [41] we use\n\u03a9 = (1 \u2212 r2 )/2 which allows a finite value of the Ricci\nscalar at the origin for the Minkowski space-time and we\nfound this to be useful in the BS case too.\nIV.\n\nSOLUTION OF THE WAVE EQUATION\n\nFollowing our convention, the conformal metric is given\nby ds2 = \u03a92 ds\u03032 , meaning that the physical metric is the\none with the tildes. We decide to solve the wave equation\nusing the conformal metric because of various reasons: (i)\nthe slices are hyperboloidal and reach J + at infinity; (ii)\nthe spatial coordinate is compactified, and therefore the\nwave function reaches future null infinity at the boundary\nr = 1; (iii) such boundary is null and there is no need to\nimpose boundary conditions there.\nIn order to use these benefits it is necessary to solve\nthe conformally invariant wave equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2737 \u2212 R \u03c6T (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = 0,\n6\n\n(19)\n\nwhere R is the Ricci scalar of the conformal metric, \u2737 =\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc also corresponds to the conformal metric and the\nphysical scalar field \u03a6\u0303 is related to the conformal scalar\nfield by \u03a6\u0303 = \u03a9\u03a6. In order to study nonradial modes, we\nwrite separate \u03c6T (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03c6(t, r)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6) with Ylm\nthe spherical harmonics and solve the resulting equations.\nWe solve numerically this equation considering a domain\nr \u2208 [rmin , 1]. For the case of the black holes we choose\nrmin such that it lies inside the event horizon and satisfies\nthe need of P (r) being real. For the case of the boson\nstars, since such solutions are real everywhere we choose\nrmin = 0.\nWe solve (19) as an initial value problem using a first\norder variable formulation. In terms of the line element\n(16) we can read off again the gauge in terms of the ADMlike metric d\u015d2 = (\u2212\u03b1\u03022 + \u03b3\u0302 2 \u03b2\u0302 2 )dt2 + 2\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302 2 drdt + \u03b3\u0302 2 dr2 +\nr2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) and obtain the following gauge and\nmetric functions\n\u03b1\u03022 (r) = \u03b12 (r)\u03a92 + \u03b2\u0302 2 (r)\u03b3\u0302 2 (r),\n\u03b12 (r)h\u2032 (r)(\u03a9 \u2212 r\u03a9\u2032 )\n\u03b2\u0302(r) = \u2212\n,\n\u03b3\u0302 2 (r)\n(a2 (r) \u2212 \u03b12 (r)h\u20322 (r))(\u03a9 \u2212 r\u03a9\u2032 )2\n,\n\u03b3\u0302 2 (r) =\n\u03a92\n\n\u03c0 = \u03b1\u0302\u03b3\u0302 \u2202t \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b1\u0302\u03b3\u0302 \u03b2\u0302\u2202r \u03c6 and \u03c8 = \u2202r \u03c6. Then Eq. (19) is\ntransformed into the following system of equations:\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u0302\n\u03c0 + \u03b2\u0302\u03c8 ,\n\u2202t \u03c8 = \u2202r\n\u03b3\u0302\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b1\u0302\nl(l + 1)\n1\n2\n\u2202t \u03c0 = 2 \u2202r r (\u03b2\u0302\u03c0 + \u03c8) \u2212 \u03b1\u0302\u03b3\u0302\n(21)\n\u03c6 ,\nR\u03c6 +\nr\n\u03b3\u0302\n6\nr2\n\u0012\n\nwhere we have included the separation of the angular\npart of the scalar field in (19). Finally, we integrate the\nsystem of equations (21) numerically using a finite differences approximation on a uniformly discretized domain;\nwe use the method of lines with sixth-order accurate stencils along the spatial direction and a fourth-order RungeKutta time integrator.\nWe use initial data corresponding to an outgoing Gaussian profile for the scalar field:\n2\n\nwhich are the final metric functions we use to solve\nthe wave equation. We choose to solve (19) as a firstorder system, for which we define first-order variables\n\n(22)\n\nAt the boundary r = 1 we do not need to impose\nboundary conditions as mentioned above, however at r =\nrmin we do the following: (i) in the case of the black holes,\nsince this boundary is located inside the event horizon,\nwe do not need to impose boundary conditions given that\nthe cones point inward there and we only verify that no\nspurious signals propagate out of the horizon; and (ii) in\nthe case of boson stars, we have to deal with the origin\nr = 0, where we first stagger the origin, and second we\n\u2202f\nsubstitute the term r12 \u2202f\n\u2202r by 3 \u2202r 3 in (21).\n\nA.\n\nTests\n\nWe use the solution of the test massless scalar field\non the Schwarzschild solution in order to have a first\nvalidation of our implementations. For this we choose the\ncase of a Schwarzschild black hole solution with mass and\nshow the amplitude of the scalar field in Fig 2, where the\nquasinormal mode and the tail decay for l = 2 are shown\nand validated. From such result we fit the frequency of\nthe oscillation which is consistent with the results in [42].\n\nB.\n\n(20)\n\n2\n\n\u03c6(0, r) = Ae\u2212(r\u2212r0 ) /\u03c3 ,\n(r \u2212 r0 )\n\u03c8(0, r) = \u22122\n\u03c6(0, r),\n\u03c32\n!\n\u03c6(0, r)\n\u03b2\u0302\u03b3\u0302\n\u03c0(0, r) = \u2212\u03c8(0, r) \u2212\n1\u2212\n.\nr\n\u03b1\u0302\n\nSolution for Boson Stars\n\nIn order to compare the behavior of the scalar field on\na black hole space-time with the behavior on a boson star\nspace-time we choose boson star configurations that are\nstable, that is, potentially black hole mimickers [10].

The effect of self-interaction is that more mass can be\nmaintained by gravity at the price of a more expanded \u2013 less\ncompact \u2013 configuration [9], here configuration C is next to\nthe critical configuration and more compact than configuration D (see Fig. 1).\n\n-2.2\n\np\n\n-2.4\n-2.6\n-2.8\n-3\n-3.2\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nt\n\nFIG. 2: (Top) We show the absolute value of the scalar field\namplitude measured at a fixed radius r = 1000M , for various values of the foliation parameters for a black hole of mass\nM = 1/2, and mode l = 2. We found that the quasinormal\nmodes have a frequency \u03c9 = 0.749 \u00b1 0.004 which is consistent with previous studies than indicate \u03c9 = 0.7473 [42], and\nthe tail decay exponent are both independent of the foliation parameters. (Bottom) We show the tail decay exponent\nfor l = 0 to be of the form \u223c tp measured also at various\ndistances from the black hole's horizon. These results are\nconsistent with the predictions of measurements by timelike\nobservers (p = \u22123 [43]) and null observers at J + (p = \u22122\n[44]), and also with recent numerical calculations of the polynomial exponent [28]. The curves represent the measurment\nby detectors located at: infinity, 1000M , 250M , 110M , 50M ,\n24M and 5M , from top to bottom, respectively.\n\nalso choose two different values of the self-interaction parameter \u039b = 0, 20, so that we sample a representative sector of the parameter space of boson star configurations.\nFor this we choose the four configurations described in\nTable I.\nWe measure the amplitude of the scalar field at various fixed distances. The absolute value of the scalar field\nmeasured at various distances is shown in Fig. 3 for the\nfour configurations described in the table. It can be noticed in the figure that for the l = 0 mode, the scalar field\nsimply decays and does not show oscillations of any kind,\npretty much as also found for black holes. However, for\nthe mode l = 2 the pair of compact configurations (cases\n\nA and C) show a set of oscillations, whereas their diluted\ncounterparts (cases B and D) do not show a clear train of\noscillations and the amplitude of the scalar field simply\ndrops. This is an important fingerprint, and a property\nto cross-check the boson star parameters of boson mass\nand self-interaction (or compactness) used to construct\nblack hole mimickers [9, 10].\nAside from the oscillations, we track the tail-type of\nbehavior following the phase of oscillation of the scalar\nfield. What has been found for black holes, is \u2013 as shown\nin Fig. 2 \u2013 that the scalar field amplitude shows a polynomial tail decay of the type \u223c tp for large values of t,\nwhere p approaches a constant negative value, and also\nobservers located at various positions measure different\ntail decay exponents. We explore the same possibility\nfor boson star space-times. Our results for l = 0 are presented in Fig. 4. For this we calculate the exponent p\nusing the fact that assuming \u03c6(x, t) \u223c Ktp with K a constant for each position where the amplitude of the field is\n|\u03c6|\nmeasured, the exponent can be expressed by p = dd log\nlog(t) ,\nand this exponent may depend on position and time as\nshown for the black hole case in Fig 2. We found in all the\nBS cases that the exponent p does not stabilize around a\nconstant value, instead, the exponent remains decreasing\nup to amplitudes of the wave function near to round-off\nerror values. For l = 2 we found similar results, although\nthe amplitude of the scalar field approaches round-off error amplitudes very quickly.\nFinally, we have verified the convergence of our results\nand found that it ranges from fourth to sixth order of convergence when resolution is increased, as expected from\nthe accuracy of our numerical methods.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have solved the massless test scalar field equation\non space-times of Schwarzschild black holes and boson\nstar configurations.

In the first plot we show\nthe scalar field amplitude corresponding to the case of central scalar field value \u03c60 (0) = 0.25 measured at various distances\nfrom the center of the star; this boson star configuration is next to the most compact configuration which is the critical solution\ncorresponding to \u03c60 (0) = 0.254 [9]; for l = 2 we show a window where oscillations similar to those of quasinormal modes are\nobserved, whereas for l = 0 the field simple decays. (Second row) We show the same quantities for the case of a boson star with\n\u03c60 (0) = 0.1 which is less compact that the other configuration. (Third and fourth rows) Results corresponding configurations\nwith \u039b = 20 and \u03c60 (0) = 0.1 nearly the most compact for this value of self-interaction and \u03c60 (0) = 0.05 less compact.\n\n\f8\n-1.5\n\n-1.5\n\nCase A, l=0\n\n-2.5\n\n-2.5\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-3.5\n\n-3.5\n\nmeasured at 16 M\nmeasured at 20 M\nmeasured at 30 M\nmeasured at 50 M\nmeasured at 80 M\nmeasured at 160 M\nmeasured at infinity\n\n-4\n\nCase B, l=0\n\n-2\n\np\n\np\n\n-2\n\nmeasured at 19 M\nmeasured at 25 M\nmeasured at 35 M\nmeasured at 60 M\nmeasured at 92 M\nmeasured at 186 M\nmeasured at infinity\n\n-4\n\n-4.5\n\n-4.5\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\nt\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nt\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.5\n\nCase C, l=0\n\n-2\n\nCase D, l=0\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n-3.5\n\n-3.5\n\np\n\n-2.5\n\np\n\n-2.5\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\nmeasured at 7 M\nmeasured at 10 M\nmeasured at 14 M\nmeasured at 23 M\nmeasured at 35 M\nmeasured at 71 M\nmeasured at infinity\n\n-4.5\n\n-5\n\nmeasured at 12 M\nmeasured at 16 M\nmeasured at 23 M\nmeasured at 39 M\nmeasured at 59 M\nmeasured at 118 M\nmeasured at infinity\n\n-4.5\n\n-5\n\n-5.5\n\n-5.5\n\n-6\n\n-6\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n0\n\nt\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nt\n\nFIG. 4: We show the polynomial exponent p measured by various observers in time for l = 0. No signs of stabilization of p\nwere found.\n\nrestrictions on the boson star parameters acting as black\nhole mimickers. We have found that this test field has a\nvery different behavior when evolving on a Schwarzschild\nblack hole space-time and when it evolves on a boson star\nbackground.\nWe found oscillations of the test field and signs similar\nto a quasinormal mode ringing for compact configurations in the l = 2 case, whereas for diluted solutions\nsuch effect was not as clear. Since we are solving for the\nmassless scalar field and not for the perturbation master equation of boson stars \u2013 which has to include the\ncoupling of the matter the boson star is made of \u2013 we\ncannot claim that these are the quasinormal modes of\nboson stars. However we have an indication that not all\nthe stable BS configurations show clear oscillations for all\nthe potential configurations that may act as black hole\n\n[1] Jose P.S. Lemos, Oleg B.

We consider this to\nbe an very important fingerprint of gravitational radiation detected once tails can be measured.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank A.
