Capture of figures\n\n108\n109\n\nReferences\n\nOxychlorides Ca2 CuO2 Cl2 and Sr2 CuO2Cl2 are antiferromagnetic insulators with Neel\ntemperatures of 255K and 247K, respectively. The spectral intensity in angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the oxychlorides gives the information about the\nnature of a single hole in CuO2 - plane. Here, we are interested the only the low-energy exitations or so-called first electron-removal states. The spectral intensity of the first electronremoval state in the oxychlorides \u2013 amplitude quasiparticle peak (QP) shows a sudden drop\nalong a line in ~k - space which closely resembles the Fermi surface (FS) obtained in the\nband-structure calculation or ARPES data of the optimally or overdoped high temperature\nsuperconductors (HTSCs). Comparing the binding energies of the first electron-removal\nstates at ~k - wave vectors on the remnant FS one can formally define a gap [1]. The gap\ndispersion of the QP peak along ~k - contour of the remnant FS is close to the d- wavesuperconductivity gap in the optimal and overdoped HTSCs, i.e. there is a clear connection\nbetween all three energy gaps.\nThe recent ARPES \u2013 experiments for the oxychlorides have shown that there is a strong\ndependence of the amplitude of QP on a photon energy [2]. For 21eV - photon energy\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nthere is the clear QP at k = (\u03c0/2 + \u01eb, \u03c0/2 + \u01eb) . And the amplitudes of peak at k =\n\u2212\n\u2192\n(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u01eb, \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u01eb) and k = (\u03c0/2 + \u01eb, \u03c0/2 + \u01eb) are approximately equal each other. In really,\nit is a strange behavior of spectral intensity in a vicinity of the remnant FS where we\nhave the right to expect the asymmetry in the amplitudes of QP at these two ~k - points\nirrespective of the photon energy. A probable explanation is the matrix element effect in\nARPES- data [2]. The later, in turn, points out that there is the different nature of the\nfirst electron-removal state at the different ~k - wave vectors. However, according to the\ngenerally accepted conclusion, these states have A1g - symmetry of Zhang-Rice (ZR-) state\non all BZ. This statement is coordinated with the polarized ARPES \u2013 data [3]. In really, we\nneed to classify the valence states according to the small irreducible representations of ~k group at the specific ~k - point. Therefore, the admissible symmetries for the first removal\n102\n\n\fstate can be very different with regard for the nature of the partial contribution to the total\nspectral intensity and ~k - point symmetry. The generalized tight binding (GTB-) approach\n[4] represents an interesting opportunity to investigate the reasons resulting in the matrix\nelement effects in ARPES- spectrum from above wider view.\nAnalyzing ARPES-data from the oxychlorides we deal with a charge-transfer insulator\n[5] and the appropriate low-energy model is reduced to the one-band Habbard model or\nextended t \u2212 J-model only in the special case [4]. In this case there is the nondegenerate\nground singlet state. In HTSCs, as believe, the ground state is the ZR-state. The last\nstatement has basically the experimental character [1, 2]. In contrast, the theoretical investigations don't give the unequivocal conclusion about a nature of the ground state in\nHTSCs. In the ab-initio works [6] it was find that ZR-state competes with 3 B1g - triplet\nstate, especially, in the area of the doped HTSC-sructures. The calculations show the triplet\nlevel is situated on 0.5 \u2212 1eV above A1g - level [4, 7]. Moreover there is a crossover between\nthe singlet and triplet levels at some parameters of the calculations. The above magnitudes\nare approximately equal to a width of the valence bands in HTSCs and we think, that there\nis a problem to coordinate theoretical and recent experimental conclusions.\nIn the works [4, 8] we have calculated the dispersion, spectral intensity and parity of\nquasiparticle states along the high symmetric directions of BZ, within the frameworks dx\n, dz , px /py , pz - five orbital general tight binding (GTB-) approach. The calculations\nreproduce the partial contributions from out-of-plane states: dz and pz in \u0393 - and M symmetric points of BZ, due to a crossing and hybridization of the bands of ZR- and 3 B1g valence states. It is surprising, that, with regard for the magnitudes of partial contributions,\na calculated picture of the spectral intensity and its dependence on the polarization also are\ncoordinated with observed ones [8].\nIn present work we reproduce the partial contributions from the in-plane and out-of-plane\nstates to the total spectral intensity on all BZ and give a probable interpretation for the\nremnant FS in the oxychlorides as ~k -area for the in-plane contribution only. As well known,\nZR- states are A1g - symmetrized combination of 3dx , 2px /2py - in-plane orbitales and, in\nturn, the triplet states are 3 B1g - symmetrized combination of 3(2)pz , 3dz , - out-of-plane\norbitales on the whole. Let's notice also, that the partial contribution from 2px /2py - inplane orbitales to 3 B1g - triplet states is not zero but is small in the all BZ [8]. We believed\n\u2212\n\u2192\nthat in k -area for the basic contribution from the out-of-plane states the dependence of\n103\n\n\fthe spectral intensity on the photon energy will arise due to the possible three-dimensional\neffects (3D) (i.e. a monotonic kz -dependence). And in ~k - area for the basic contribution\nfrom the in-plane states the oscillations of spectral intensity at the different photon energies\nare possible only [2]. The oscillations are caused by the diffraction of an photoelectronic\nwave on the periodic structure of oxychlorides along c-axis. Namely in this mean we have\nused the term: \" effective dimension\" placed in a title of the work.\nWe will start from the recent results obtained at T = 0K within the framework of GTBapproach where alongside with A1g -state there is the 3 B1g - state in the two-hole sector of\nGilbert space. They may are briefly summarized as the following:\n- on the top of the valence band of oxychlorides in the antiferromagnetic (AFM-) phase\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2212\n\u2192\nthere is the pseudogap of the magnetic nature: ES k \u223c 0 \u00f7 0.4eV between the virtual\nlevel and valence band. The pseudogap converts into zero at ~k = M\u0304 . The virtual level has\nthe small spectral intensity, proportional to the concentration of the zero spin fluctuations\nn0 . The pseudogap disappears in the paramagnetic (PM-) phase, where the dispersion of\nthe valence band is similar to the dispersion of the optimally and overdoped HTSCs [9];\n- the valence band of the oxychlorides has no only two-dimensional character, and on BZ\nthere are the ~k - areas where the triplet contribution from dz - orbital of copper and pz orbital of the apical ions Cl or O isn't precisely equal to zero;\n- the experimental k-dependences of QP-amplitude in the spectral intensity of\noxichlorides[9] are satisfactorily described by the ~k - dependences of the partial contribution\nto the total spectral density obtained in the framework of GTB- approach. The feature of\nthese dependencies is the nonzero contribution from triplet states in \u0393 - and M - symmetric\npoints of BZ.\nThus, the presence of states with the symmetry of distinct from A1g - symmetry, namely\nof triplet 3 B1g - states, does not contradict the ARPES-data. Further we, with a help of the\nsimilar approach, will reproduce separately both the Aout (k, E) -contribution from the triplet\nout-of-plane states, and Ain (k, E) -contribution from the singlet in-plane states on all BZ.\nThe details of GTB-approach and magnitudes of parameters can be found in the works [4, 10,\n11]. The calculation was carried out in AFM- and PM- phases at T=0K. In Fig.1,2(a,b,c) the\namplitudes of the quasiparticle peak for the partial contributions: Ain (k, E) and Aout (k, E)\nto the total spectral intensity are showed. In Fig.1(d) the dispersion of the quasiparticle\npeak on all BZ is showed and well reproduces one observed in [9]. In PM-phase (Fig.2(d))\n104\n\n\fthe dispersion is similar to one in doped HTSCs. We have found, that Ain (k, E) - partial\n\ncontribution is distributed along ~k - contour close to the edge of the antiferromagnetic BZ\n(Fig.1(c)) in AFM-phase. In PM-phase (Fig.2(c)), ~k - contour loses the symmetry and to\nbecome more close to one of the remnant FS [1]. We can suppose that it is not simple\ncoincidence provided that the procedure of recovery of FS by integration on the fixed energy\ninterval is insufficient in the considered case.\nHere, both the dispersion, and spectral intensity are calculated without taking into\naccount the any processes of relaxation. There is only the phenomenological damping\n\u01eb = 10\u22123 eV to obtain a lorentzian form of curve of spectral intensity (Fig.3). Specificity\nof considered materials is that namely the strongly correlated nature of the quasiparticle\nstates in BZ result in ~k - dependence of the amplitude of QP. However, we think the specific\nsinglet-triplet character of the quasiparticle states means also the two-channel relaxation\nprocess.\nThe calculations of an effective speed of relaxation with the account for the strong cor105\n\n\frelated nature of the quasiparticle states within the framework of the impurity diagram\n\u0001\u22121\n2\n2\nv\u03c3\ntechnique [12] show [13], that in according to Matissen's rule \u03c4 \u03c3ef f\n= \u03c4uin\u03c3 + \u03b1\u03c4\u03c3out\n- the\nspeed of relaxation is additive function of the contributions with weights u2\u03c3 and v\u03c32 , a sense\n\nof which consists in the probability with which the carrier participates in the scattering on\nthe appropriate potential for in-plane and out-of-plane states. u2\u03c3 + v\u03c32 = 1 , and \u03b1\u03c3 depends\non the specific character of states and reflects a presence of strong correlations renormalizing\nthe hybridization effects of the states. The scattering potentials for these groups of states\ncan be different, because their spatial nature is different also. It may be effects nonstoichiometry along the in-plane and apical positions or fluctuations of the magnetic moment in\nand between CuO2 - planes. For example, we can account the nonstoichiometry effects by\nmeans of the following arguments. In the ~k - areas for only triplet contribution v 2 \u2248 1 and\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c4 \u03c3ef f \u2248\n\n\u03c4 out\n\u03b1\u03c3\n\n\u223c cout , where cout - concentration of the scattering centers for carriers in the\nout-of-plane states. Along the ~k -contour of the remnant FS accordingly \u03c4 \u03c3ef f \u2248 \u03c4 in \u223c cin .\nNote also, that at v\u03c32 , u2\u03c3 6= 0 due to the absence of the scattering in CuO2 - planes cin \u2192 0 it\n106\n\n\fcan be obtained \u03c4 \u03c3ef f\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n2\nv\u03c3\n,\n\u03c4 out\n\ni.e. the relaxation takes place even at absence of scattering\nprocesses in CuO2 - planes. Thus, crossing from one of ~k - areas BZ in another one we\n\u2248\n\nshould observe the widening or narrowing of the quasiparticle peak in according to relation\nbetween cout and cin . In the case cout >> cin the amplitude of qusiparticle peak in ~k -area\nfor the triplet states falls and to collect all intensity the much greater energy interval than\nin ~k -area for contribution only from the in-plane states is required.\nThe two-channel scattering of carriers on the spin fluctuations may be more actual in\nthe oxychlorides. In the experiments using a magnetic neutron scattering, in contrast the\nclassical K2 NiF4 where a transition to the 3D- Bragg peak observed in 2%- interval from\nTN , the dynamic scattering in La2 CuO4 transformed in the three-dimensional one from\nTN = 195K gradually. Even at the high temperatures \u223c 350K the low-energy spin fluctuations in La1.89 Sr0.11 CuO4 have still 3D\u2212 character [13]. According to empirical conclusions,\nthe lengths of spin correlations are equal to \u03be || \u2248 18 \u00b1 6\u00c5 and \u03be \u22a5 \u2248 5.5 \u00b1 2.2\u00c5. At the\nsame temperature the carrier in the out-of-plane state from 3 B1g \u2212 symmetrized combina107\n\n\ftion, situated at the more hot spot of BZ than the carrier in the in-plane state from A1g \u2212\nsymmetrized combination.\nThus, the method of integration with a constant interval is unacceptable at the presence\nof contributions to the total spectral intensity from so different states. There is a risk,\nthat the method of the integration used in [1] does not reproduce in particular not only\nthe remnant FS, but also one of the contributions to the total spectral intensity with least\nrelaxation time. Namely the contribution from dx -, px / py - orbitales.\nWe think, that as consequence of the scattering processes, the contribution from the\ntriplet states reproduces, in turn, a noncoherent part of the spectral intensity in ARPESspectra of oxychlorides. Therefore the effective dimension of the quasiparticle states can rise\n\u2212\n\u2192\nup to 3D in the vicinity of \u0393 - and M - symmetric points of BZ. In these k - areas we can\nexpect the monotonic dependence of the noncoherent part on the photon energy. Probably,\nthere is also an opportunity to observe not only oscillations of the coherent part as it was\nmade in work [14], but oscillations of the relation of the coherent and noncoherent parts of\nthe spectral intensity at the different photon energy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank S.G.Ovchinnikov for the discussion on this subject.
