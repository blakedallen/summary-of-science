The\nprincipal interest in the study on Bose\u2013Einstein condensation is its interdisciplinary nature. From the thermodynamic point of view, this phenomenon can be interpreted as a phase transition, and from the quantum mechanical point of view as a matter wave coherence arising from overlapping de Broglie waves of the atoms, in\nwhich many of them condense to the grown state of the\nsystem. In quantum field theory, this phenomenon is related to the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry\n[2]. Symmetry breaking is one of the most essential concepts in particle theory and has been extensively used\nin the study of the behavior of particle interactions in\nmany theories [3]. The concept with the accompanying\nwave function describing the condensate, was first introduced in explaining superconductivity and super fluidity [4]. Phase transitions are changes of state, related\nwith changes of symmetries of the system. The analysis of Symmetry breaking mechanisms have turn out to\nbe very helpful in the study of phenomena associated to\nphase transitions in almost all areas of physics. BoseEinstein Condensation is one topic of interest that uses\nin an extensive way the Symmetry breaking mechanisms\n[2], its phase transition associated with the condensation\nof atoms in the state of lowest energy and is the con-\n\n\u2020 Part\n\nof the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmolog\u0131\u0301a (IAC) collaboration\nhttp://www.iac.edu.mx/\n\u2217 Electronic address: ecastellanos@fis.cinvestav.mx\n\u2021 Electronic address: tmatos@fis.cinvestav.mx\n\nsequence of quantum, statistical and thermodynamical\neffects.\nOn the other hand, the results from finite temperature\nquantum field theory [5, 6] raise important challenges\nabout their possible manifestation in condensed matter\nsystems. By investigating the massive Klein\u2013Gordon\nequation (KG), in [7] we were able to show, that the\nKlein\u2013Gordon equation can simulate a condensed matter system. In [7] it was shown that the Klein\u2013Gordon\nequation with a self interacting scalar field (SF) in a\nthermal bath reduces to the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation\nin the no-relativistic limit, provided that the temperature of the thermal bath is zero. Thus, the Klein\u2013\nGordon equation reduces to a generalized relativistic,\nGross\u2013Pitaevskii equation at finite temperature. But a\nquestion remains open. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation with\na self interacting scalar field potential defines a symmetry\nbreaking temperature, at which the system experiments\na phase transition. However, this phase transition does\nnot necessarily means a condensation of the particles of\nthe system. Here, our aim is to study a model made up of\na real scalar field together with the possibility that this\nSF might undergo a phase transition as the temperature\nof the system is lowered. Nevertheless, the fact that the\nsystem breaks its original symmetry at some temperature\nis not a guarantee that the system undergoes a condensation at the same one. The main aim of the present\nwork is to obtain the temperature of condensation of a\nSF system of particles and compare it with the symmetry\nbreaking temperature, using realistic systems. Consider\nthe easiest case of a double-well interacting potential for\na real scalar field \u03a6(~x, t) that goes as\nm2 c2 2\n\u03bb\n\u03a6 + 2 2 \u03a64 .\n(1)\n2~2\n4~ c\nHere one important idea, to which we shall refer, is\nthat of identifying the order parameter which characV (\u03a6) = \u2212\n\n\f2\nterizes the phase transition with the value of the real\nscalar quantum field \u03a6. From quantum field theory we\nknow that the dynamics of a SF is governed by the KleinGordon equation, it is the equation of motion of a field\ncomposed of spinless particles. In this case we will add\nan external field that will interact with the SF to first\norder, such that the KG equation will be given by\n\n\u27372 \u03a6 \u2212\n\ndV (\u03a6)\nm2 c2\n\u2212 2 2 \u03a6\u03c6 = 0.\nd\u03a6\n~\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the D' Alambertian \u27372 is defined as\n\u27372 = \u22072 \u2212\n\n1 \u22022\n,\nc2 \u2202t2\n\n(3)\n\nand the external potential here is denoted by \u03c6. We suppose that the scalar field has a temperature T such that\nwe can consider that the scalar field is in a thermal bath\nof temperature T . In this case, the scalar field can be\ndescribed by the potential (1) up to one loop in corrections. The scalar field potential in a thermal bath at\ntemperature T is given by [5, 6]\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nm2 c2 2\n2 2 2\n\u03a6 + 2 2 \u03a64 + 2 2 kB\nT \u03a6 (4)\n2~2\n4~ c\n8~ c\n2\n\u03c0\n\u2212\nk4 T 4,\n90~2 c2 B\n\nV (\u03a6) = \u2212\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann's constant, and \u03bb is the selfcoupling constant.\nIt is convenient to consider the total potential VT\nadding the external one; using this fact, we are able to\nexpress (2) as follows\n\u27372 \u03a6 +\n\ndVT (\u03a6)\n= 0,\nd\u03a6\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nm2 c2 2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2 2 2\n\u03a6 + 2 2 \u03a64 + 2 2 kB\nT \u03a6 (6)\n2~2\n4~ c\n8~ c\nm2 c2 2\n\u03c02\n4 4\nk\nT\n\u2212\n\u03c6\u03a6 .\n\u2212\nB\n90~2 c2\n~2\n\npotential extended to one loop and immersed in a thermal\nbath (6). Neglecting the term proportional to T 4 , assuming that the temperature is sufficiently small, then, the\ncritical temperature where the minimum of the potential\n\u03a6 = 0 becomes a maximum is [8]\n\u00111/2\n2mc2 \u0010\nkB TcSB = \u221a\n1 + 2\u03c6\n.\n\u03bb\n\nThis is the temperature at which the symmetry of the\nsystem is broken. The fact that the field \u03a6 is a real\nscalar field, has as a consequence that the associated Lagrangian is invariant under the transformation \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6\n(this is the so\u2013called Z2 symmetry, which is a discrete\nsymmetry) [20], and the Klein-Gordon equation (5), is\nalso invariant under this symmetry. In this case, for\ntemperatures T > TcSB we have a minimum in \u03a6 = 0\nfor the potential (6), which is invariant under the symmetry \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6. For temperatures T < TcSB we have two\nminima in\n!\n\u0010 \u03ba T \u00112 1/2\nmc2\nB\n1 + 2\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb\n\u03a6min = \u00b1 \u221a\n,\n(8)\n2mc2\n\u03bb\nthese two minima are not invariant under the symmetry\n\u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6 (in fact it maps each of the two vacua into the\nother). In this case, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken [21]. Expression (8), allows us define the\ncritical temperature (7) at which the symmetry \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6\nof the two the minima of the potential (6) is broken.\nHowever, we must add that the TcSB is valid only close\nto the minimum \u03a6 = 0.\nLet us suppose that the external potential \u03c6 is time\nindependent and that can be described as a harmonic\noscillator type\u2013potential \u03c6 \u223c r2 . Clearly, this can be extended to a more general potentials. With these assumptions, the critical temperature TcSB near to the center of\nthe system (~r = 0) is given by\n2mc2\nkB TcSB = \u221a .\n\u03bb\n\nVT (\u03a6) = \u2212\n\nWhen the temperature T is high enough, one of the minimums of the potential (4) is \u03a6 = 0. On the other hand,\nwhen the temperature is sufficiently small, the term proportional to T 4 is not longer important, as for sufficiently\nlow T the term that goes as T 4 can be dropped out (see\n[7]).\nII. CRITICAL TEMPERATURE FROM THE\nSYMMETRY BREAKING OF KLEIN\u2013GORDON\nFIELDS\n\nLet us calculate the critical temperature associated to\nthe Klein\u2013Gordon equation (5), with the corresponding\n\n(7)\n\n(9)\n\nWe notice also, that in the case when \u03bb \u2192 0, the critical\ntemperature TcSB \u2192 \u221e.\nIn order to show how the Klein\u2013Gordon equation is a\ngeneralization of the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation, we perform the transformation\n\u0001\n1\n(10)\n\u03ba\u03a6 = \u221a \u03a8 e\u2212im\u0302ct + \u03a8\u2217 eim\u0302ct\n2\n\nwhere \u03ba is the scale of the system, which is to be determined by an experiment, and m\u03022 = m2 c2 /~2 .\nIn terms of function \u03a8, the Klein\u2013Gordon equation (2)\nreduces to,\ni~\u03a8\u0307 +\n\n~2 2\n\u03bbk 2 T 2\n3\u03bb\n|\u03a8|2 \u03a8 \u2212 mc2 \u03c6\u03a8 + B 2 \u03a8 = 0,\n\u2737 \u03a8+\n2\n2m\n2mc\n8mc\n(11)\n\n\f3\nand an equivalent equation for the complex conjugate.\nHere  \u0307 = \u2202/\u2202t and |\u03a8|2 = \u03a8\u03a8\u2217 = \u03c1. Let us to remark that (11) is the Klein\u2013Gordon equation rewritten\nin terms of the function \u03a8. However, the transformation (10) is not unique. For instance, we can change \u03a8\nto \u03a8\u2032 = \u03a8 + iF eim\u0302ct , with F a real field. If one inserts\nthis new transformation in (10) then, \u03a6 is unchanged and\ntherefore F is apparently undetermined. Nevertheless, if\nwe express \u03a8\u2032 in terms of a modulus n\u2032 and a phase S \u2032\nas\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u03ba\u03a8\u2032 = n\u2032 eiS .\n(12)\nthen, we obtain an expression for the particle density n\u2032\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nn =\u03ba \u03a8\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the scale associated to the system. From (13),\nwe obtain an expression for the density associated to \u03a8\u2032\nin function of \u03a8\n\n2\n\nand F 2 given by\n\n\u0010\nn\u2032 = \u03ba2 \u03a8\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n+ F 2 + iF Im{eim\u0302ct \u03a8} ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhich in terms of the corresponding densities can be rewritten as,\nn\u2032 = n + nF + J,\n\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nwhere J = n\u03baF sin(m\u0302ct \u2212 S), being Im{eim\u0302ct \u03a8} the\nimaginary part of eim\u0302ct \u03a8. If we assume that n and nF\nare particle densities associated to the fields \u03a8\n\n2\n\nand\n\nF 2 respectively, then we are able to interpreted the term\n\u221a\nJ = n nF sin(m\u0302ct \u2212 S) as an oscillation of the particle\n2\n\ndensity between these two fields, provided that \u03a8\u2032 fullfils the normalization condition over the total number of\nparticles\nZ\n2\nN = d3~r \u03a8\u2032 .\n(16)\n\nUsing these facts, we are able to determine the field F ,\nresorting to equation (13) or (16). On the other hand,\nobserve that when T = 0 and in the non-relativistic limit,\n\u27372 \u2192 \u22072 , eq. (11) becomes the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for Bose-Einstein Condensates, which is an approximate equation for the mean-field order parameter in the\nclassical theory [9]. Equation (11) can also be written as\ni~\u03a8\u0307 +\n\n~2 2\n3\u03bb\n|\u03a8|2 \u03a8 \u2212 mc2 \u03c6\u03a8\n\u2737 \u03a8+\n2m\n2mc2\n\u0012\n\u00132\nT\nmc2\n\u03a8 = 0,\n+\n2\nTcSB\n(17)\n\nwhich implies that if T << TcSB , the last term of equation (17) can be neglected. We expect that this equation is a good approximation for the condensation process close to the symmetry breaking temperature TcSB .\n\nThe static limit of equation (11) or (17) is known as the\nGinzburg-Landau equation. This is the reason why we\ninterpret (11) as a generalization of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation for finite temperatures and relativistic particles\n(see [8] for details). Nevertheless, the critical temperature for the break down of the symmetry is not necessarily a sign of condensation, TcSB could be different to the\ncritical temperature of condensation. The main goal of\nthis work is to compare both temperatures and to give\nsome ideas how to compare them with experiments in the\nlaboratory.\n\nIII.\n\nCONDENSATION TEMPERATURE\n\nIn order to calculate the condensation temperature associated to the aforementioned system and its relation\nwith the critical temperature TcSB , let us insert plane\nwaves in equation (2). This fact allows us to obtain the\nsingle\u2013particle dispersion relation between energy and\nmomentum [10], which we interpreted as the semiclassical energy spectrum associated to the Klein\u2013Gordon\nequation in a thermal bath, with the result (we considered here the low velocities limit)\n\nEp \u2243 mc2 +\n\n2\np2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03a6 +\n(\u03baB T )2 +mc2 \u03c6 (18)\n+\n2\n2m 2mc\n4mc2\n\nAdditionally, we interpreted \u03ba2 \u03a6(~r, t)\n\n2\n\nas the spatial\n\ndensity n(~r, t) of the cloud, where \u03ba is the scale of the\nsystem. Assuming static thermal equilibrium n(~r, t) \u2248\nn(~r) [11], then\n\n\u03a6\n\n2\n\n\u2261 \u03ba\u22122 n(~r).\n\n(19)\n\nUsing (19) and neglecting the rest mass, we can re\u2013\nwrite the semiclassical energy spectrum (18) as follows\n\nEp \u2243\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\u03ba\u22122\np2\nn(~r) +\n(\u03baB T )2 + mc2 \u03c6.\n+\n2\n2m 2mc\n4mc2\n\n(20)\n\nIs noteworthy to mention that if we set \u03bb \u2261 16\u03c0~2 c2 \u03ba2 a\nand \u03c6 \u2261 \u03b1r2 , with \u03b1 \u2261 1/2(\u03c90 /c)2 , where a is the s\u2013wave\nscattering length and \u03c90 is the frequency of an isotropic\nharmonic oscillator say (this can be generalized for different types of potentials), we obtain the semiclassical energy spectrum in the Hartree\u2013Fock approximation for a\nbosonic gas trapped in an external potential (an isotropic\nharmonic oscillator according to our previous assumptions), but with an extra term due to the contributions of\nthe thermal bath. The Hartree\u2013Fock approximation consists basically in the assumption that the constituents of\nthe gas behave like a non\u2013interacting bosons, moving in\na self\u2013consistent mean field and is valid when Ep >> \u03bc,\nbeing \u03bc the chemical potential [11, 14]. On the other\n\n\f4\nhand, within the semiclassical approximation, the spatial density n(~r) reads [11, 14]\nn(~r) =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0~)3\n\nZ\n\nd3 ~\np n(~r, p~),\n\n(21)\n\nwhere n(~r, ~p) is the Bose\u2013Einstein distribution function\ngiven by [11, 14]\nn(~r, ~\np) =\n\n1\ne\u03b2(Ep \u2212\u03bc)\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03b2 = 1/kB T , and Ep is\nthe semiclassical energy spectrum. The number of particles in the 3\u2013dimensional space obey the normalization\ncondition [11, 14]\nZ\nN = d3~r n(~r).\n(23)\nLet us analyze expression (23). From the grand canonical\nensemble formalism, one can derives the Bose-Einstein\ndistribution function (22) which is valid for bosons [15,\n16]. In this formalism the number of particles is a fixed\nquantity given by\nX\n1\nN=\n,\n(24)\n\u03b2(E\u2212\u03bc)\ne\n\u22121\nE\nwhere E is the single particle energy. Resorting to the\nconcept of thermodynamic limit [12], we can replace the\nsum by an integral, this is the so-called continuum approximation [15, 16],\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03a9(E)n(~r, p~)dE,\n(25)\nN = N0 +\n(2\u03c0~)3 0\nwhere N0 is the number of particles in the ground state\nand \u03a9(E) is the number of microstates per energy unit\n[15, 16]. Expression (25) is totally equivalent to (23).\nIn the grand canonical ensemble, the total number of\nparticles and the total energy associated to the system\nin question are fixed [15, 16], which means, a conserved\nquantities. Since the chemical potential \u03bc is not fixed,\nbut the total number of particles N and the total energy\nassociated to the system are conserved [15, 16] then, the\nvalue of the chemical potential \u03bc has to be determined\nusing the constraint that the number of particles is fixed.\nLet us calculate the condensation temperature. Integrating the spatial density (21) in the momentum space, using\nthe semiclassical energy spectrum (20) associated with\nthe KG equation (2), together with the Bose\u2013Einstein\ndistribution function (22) leads us to\n!3/2\nmkB T\nn(~r) =\ng3/2 (z(~r)),\n(26)\n2\u03c0~2\nwhere z(~r) is given by\n\u03bb\u03ba\u22122\n\n\u03bb\n\nz(~r) = e\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212 2mc2 n(~r)\u2212 4mc2 (\u03baB T )\n\n2\n\n\u2212mc2 \u03c6)\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nThe function g\u03bd (z) is the so\u2013called Bose\u2013Einstein function defined by [14, 15]\nZ \u221e \u03bd\u22121\n1\nx\ndx\ng\u03bd (z) =\n.\n(28)\n\u22121\nx\n\u0393(\u03bd) 0 z e \u2212 1\nWith the use of the harmonic oscillator\u2013type\u2013potential\n\u03c6 = \u03b1r2 , the function z(~r) can be re\u2013written as follows\n\u03bb\u03ba\u22122\n\n\u03bb\n\nz(~r) = e\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212 2mc2 n(~r)\u2212 4mc2 (\u03baB T )\n\n2\n\n\u2212mc2 \u03b1r 2 )\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nIf \u03bb = 0 and r = 0, z(~r) is just the fugacity z = exp(\u03b2\u03bc)\n[14, 15].\nExpanding (26) at first order in the coupling constant\n\u03bb, using the properties of the Bose\u2013Einstein functions,\n[15]\nx\n\n\u2202\ng\u03bd (x) = g\u03bd\u22121 (x),\n\u2202x\n\n(30)\n\nallows us to express the spatial density as follows\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2 2\n(31)\nn(~r) \u2248 n0 (~r) \u2212 \u03bb g1/2 e\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212\u03b1mc r )\n\"\n\u0010 k T \u00112 \u0010 m \u00113\n\u0011\n\u0010\nB\n\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212\u03b1mc2 r 2 )\n\u00d7\ng\ne\n3/2\n2\u03bac\n\u03c0~2\n\u0011\n\u0010\nr\n\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212\u03b1mc2 r 2 ) #\n5 T 5 m g3/2 e\nkB\n\u0011 ,\n\u0010\n\u2212\n2 5 \u03c0 3 ~6 c4 g\ne\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212\u03b1mc2 r2 )\n1/2\n\nwhere\n\nn0 (~r) =\n\nmkB T\n2\u03c0~2\n\n!3/2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2 2\ng3/2 e\u03b2(\u03bc\u2212\u03b1mc r ) ,\n\n(32)\n\nis the density for case \u03bb = 0.

If we set \u03bb = 0 in\nexpression (33), we may obtain the expression for the\nnumber of particles for the non\u2013interacting case. At the\ncondensation temperature in the thermodynamic limit in\n\n\f5\nthe case \u03bb = 0, \u03bc = 0 [14], and assuming that the number\nof particles in the ground state above the condensation\ntemperature is negligible, allows us obtain an expression\nfor the condensation temperature for the non\u2013interacting\ncase T0 , given by\n\u0010 N \u221a2\u03b13 \u00111/3\n~c,\n(35)\nkB T0 =\n\u03b6(3)\nwhere \u03b6(x) is the Riemann Zeta function. Additionally,\nsetting \u03b1 \u2261 1/2(\u03c90 /c)2 , we recover the condensation temperature for a bosonic gas trapped in an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential [14]. In order to obtain the\nleading correction in the shift for the critical temperature respect to T0 caused by the coupling constant \u03bb and\nthe thermal bath in our bosonic gas, let us expand the\nexpression (33) at first order in T = T0 , \u03bc = 0, and\n\u03bb = 0, T0 is the condensation temperature for the non\u2013\ninteracting case (35), with the result\n1\n\n\"\n\nN = \u221a\n\u03b6(3)(kB T0 )\n2\u03b13 (~c)3\n\n2\n\n+ 3\u03b6(3)(kB T0 ) kB [T \u2212 T0 ] + (kB T0 ) \u03b6(2)\u03bc\n\n\u0011\u22121 \u03ba\u22121 \u03b11/8 \u0010 mc \u00115/4\n\u0010\n2\u0398N 1/12 .\nTcSB = 1 \u2212 Tr\nkB\n2\u03c0~\n\n(40)\n\n\u0011\u22121 mc\u03ba\u22121 \u0010 5.2 \u00111/2\n\u0010\nTcSB = 1 \u2212 Tr\nN 1/12 .\n~kB\n8\u03c0aho\n\n(41)\n\nwhere Tr = Tc /T0 , and \u0398 is defined in expression (39).\nIn the case of a harmonic oscillator with \u03bb = 16\u03c0~2 c2 \u03ba2 a,\nand \u03b1 = 1/2(\u03c90 /c)2 expression (40) becomes\n\nwhere we used the usual definition for the characteristic\nlength of the oscillator\n(36)\n\u0010 ~ \u00111/2\naho =\n.\n(42)\nm\u03c90\n\n3\n\n2\n\n(37) at the condensation temperature.

A\n\nof the symmetry of the system and the critical temperature of the condensation are somehow related or whether\nthey are of the same order of magnitude. In this work\nwe have given an answer. We have analyzed the relation\nbetween the critical temperature associated to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar fields in a thermal\nbath characterized by a Klein\u2013Gordon equation and the\ncorresponding condensation temperature. We obtain the\nsemiclassical energy spectrum associated to this system,\nfrom which we deduced the spatial density, interpreting\n\u03ba2 as the scale that relates the usual definition of spatial density within the semiclassical approximation and\nthe density associated to the self\u2013interacting part of the\npotential in the Klein\u2013Gordon equation. We show that\nthe condensation temperature is independent of the thermal bath, with the aforementioned conditions, and we\nprove that TcSB > T0 > Tc , when the coupling constant\nis positive. Additionally, we estimate the order of magnitude of the scale \u03ba, which according to the definition\n(19) and the relation (46), is very small in typical experiments. These arguments shows us that, in principle,\nthe relevant thermodynamic properties associated to the\nsystem, in particular the healing length \u03be , could be used\nto provide bounds for the scale \u03ba, and consequently for\nTcSB and its relation with the condensation temperature.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by CONACyT\nM\u00e9xico under grants CB-2009-01, no. 132400, CB2011, no. 166212, and I0101/131/07 C-234/07 of the\nInstituto Avanzado de Cosmolog\u0131\u0301a (IAC) collaboration\n(http://www.iac.edu.mx/).\n\n54 (1996)\n[14] C.
