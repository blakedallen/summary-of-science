Introduction.\nAny detector for the studies of X-ray diffraction to large angles has to present essentially curved\ngeometry with conversion, readout and possibly amplifying structure that surrounds the scattering\nsource. The detector OD3 with angular aperture up to 30o for powder diffraction experiments has\nbeen already designed and constructed in Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics [1]. This detector\nhas been built on the basis of wire chamber. However further development of a detector with larger\nangular aperture and considerably curved cylindrical geometry is impossible on such basis. Thus\nin order to cover the wider range of diffraction angles the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [2] was\nproposed to be used as the multiplying element.\nGEM is a thin plastic foil double clad with copper layers from both sides and pierced with\nregular array of small diameter holes. Regular GEM is produced of 50\u03bc m thick kapton foil and\nhas 140\u03bc m holes pitch and 80\u03bc m holes diameter. Gas amplification occurs in the GEM holes\nwhen high voltage is applied between the two foil sides. GEMs can be cascaded and in a tripleGEM cascade can provide stable gain up to and higher than \u223c 105 in a regular gas mixures like\nAr \u2212CO2 (70-30) [3].\nFlat and flexible amplifying structure of GEM allows to prepare arc-shaped GEM cascade that\ncan surround the scattering source in a WAXS experiment. Such approach can solve the problem\nof large angular aperture for a gaseous detector.\nThe first measurements with the small prototype and simulations demonstrating feasibility of\nthis approach were described elsewhere ( [4], [5]). This paper presents the first results obtained\nwith full-size detector.\n\n2. Detector design and experimental set-up.\nThe detector for WAXS studies based on cascaded GEM (OD4) is shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nX-rays from the scattering source get into the gas box through the Be window and are absorbed\nin 5.5mm thick drift gap between the drift cathode and the top GEM. The triple-GEM stack with\nGEM to GEM distance of 1.5mm is attached on top of the multi-strip PCB at a distance of 2.5mm.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1. Schematic view of OD4 design.\n\nDrift cathode, GEMs and PCB have arc shape with the center at the scattering source. Strips of the\nPCB are positioned along radii of the circle with the center at the source. The PCB contains 2048\nstrips with the pitch of 0.2mm at the entrance side.\nThe detector is intended to work with soft X-rays in the range of 5keV to 15kev and is filled\nwith Ar \u2212CO2 (3:1) mixture at atmospheric pressure.\nThe OD4 electronics is implemented on the basis of preamplifier-shaper chip IC31A [6] developed for the electronics of PHENIX detector at RHIC (BNL, USA). Each strip of the PCB is\nconnected to an input of the preamplifier-shaper through the flexible cable. The outputs of preamplifiers are connected to the comparators with single and adjustable threshold and logical pulses\nafter the comparators are counted by scalers.\nAt present the final electronics is not yet ready and only 32 strips in the center of the detector\nhave been equipped with preamplifier-shapers and comparators. 64 strips from both sides of the\nequipped area have been connected to ground to ensure uniform field in the central region. The\ndetector during assembling is shown in Fig. 2 where triple-GEM cascade installed on top of the\nPCB can be observed. Fig. 3 demonstrates assembled detector.\nThe GEM electrodes and drift cathode have been powered through the single-line resistive\ndivider that was adjusted to minimize transverse diffusion and have reasonable GEM transparency\nduring electrons drift from drift gap to the PCB. The adjustment of the voltages across transfer\ngaps, induction gap and drift gap has been performed for the conditions when the voltages across\nGEMs provide total effective gain of the whole cascade around 10000.\nFor the measurements described in this paper the OD4 has been installed at one of synchrotron\nradiation lines at VEPP-3 electron ring. After monochromator the X-ray beam with 8.3 keV energy\nwas collimated by 20\u03bc m slit. Effective beam size at the entrance window of the detector was 20\u03bc m\nin horizontal and \u223c1mm in vertical. The detector was positioned with 3 stands that allow precise\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2. Photo of the detector during assembly.

With these stands the\nstrips equipped with the electronics could be aligned along the beam as the source was not at the\nfocus of the detector(350mm).\n\n3. Results and discussion\nWhen an X-ray photon is absorbed in the drift gap of the detector, after charge transport and am-\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fplification the final charge cluster occupies in average more than 1 strip. The charge distribution\nand its effect on spatial resolution was discussed in details in our previous paper( [4]) where the\nresults of simulations were compared to the measurements with the prototype of the present detector. However the important outcome of the charge distribution over several strips is that even\nif the detector is irradiated with the constant flux of photons, the counting rate will depend on the\ncomparators threshold, gas gain and the flux distribution in space. Fig. 4 demonstrates the counting\nrate as a function of voltage at the resistive divider in 1 arbitrary channel, coincidence between\n2,3 and 4 neighboring channels while the detector has been uniformly irradiated with Fe55 5.9keV\nphotons. The comparators threshold has been close to 150mV in this measurement that, according\nto the electronic calibration (measured amplifier gain was 14mV/fC), corresponded to the gas gain\nof \u223c300 for 5.9keV X-rays. Counting rate of a single channel is increasing in the whole range of\nvoltages as more channels get hit with increasing gas gain. Above Vd=2750V most of the rate is\nproduced by coincident hits of several channels.\nHowever the counting rate dependence on voltage looks differently if the detector is irradiated\nwith narrow X-ray beam. If all the photons are absorbed within one channel and no charge can\ncome from the neighboring areas, the counting rate becomes constant when all the signals induced\nby absorbed photons become larger than the threshold. In Fig. 5 the counting rate vs voltage\ndependence for several comparator thresholds are presented. The 20\u03bc m beam of 8.3 keV photons\nhits the center of the channel in this measurement. The starting points of counting rate plateau\ngive information about average signal value at a given voltage, thus the gain-voltage characteristic\ncan be derived from this data.

The gainvoltage dependence fits well to similar data from [3] and [4].\nFor the studies of spatial resolution the detector has been moved horizontally in such a way\nthat 20\u03bc m wide X-ray beam has scanned the area of several detector channels. Counting rate as\na function of beam position for each channel (channel response curve) has been used for characterization of the spatial resolution. The measurements have been performed at a different detector\nvoltages and different comparator thresholds in order to observe the dependence of resolution on\nthese parameters. An example of the set of channel response curves for Vd=2580V (VGEM \u223c360V,\nGain\u223c3000) and the threshold that provides 90% efficiency in the central channel is shown in\nFig. 7.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f380\n\n385\n\n390\n\nVGEM, V\n395\n\n400\n\n405\n\n410\n\n22000\n\n1 channel\n4 channels\n3 channels\n2 channels\n\n20000\n18000\n\nCounting rate, Hz\n\n16000\n14000\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n2700\n\n2750\n\n2800\n\n2850\n\n2900\n\n2950\n\nVd, V\n\nFigure 4.

The left channel has slightly higher gain and thus reach full efficiency already at\nthis voltage and threshold. The lower is the threshold the smaller signal can be detected and thus\nthe channel response curve is becoming wider. On the other hand when the threshold is too high\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fthe efficiency starts to drop. Fig. 8 demonstrates the dependence of spatial resolution (FWHM of\nchannel response curve) on the efficiency, derived from several measurements of channel response\ncurves. All these measurements have been done at Vd=2580V.\nThus spatial resolution can be tuned in a wide range by the adjustment of the comparator\nthreshold and/or the detector gain. At the level of 90% efficiency the resolution is close to 470\u03bc m\nand can be improved to FWHM\u223c330\u03bc m at the expense of the efficiency that drops down to 50%\nin the latter case.\nSpatial resolution obtained with 90% efficiency is good enough to allow separation of two\ndiffraction spots at angular distance of 0.1 degree that corresponds to \u223c0.6mm for this detector. The\nimage of two such spots positioned symmetrically with respect to the central channel is calculated\nusing the channel response curve from Fig. 7 and shown in Fig. 9.\nHigh rate capability is one of the advantages of GEM based detectors over wire chambers.\nSmaller amplifier cells (140\u03bc m distance between holes in GEM) allow faster charge removal and\nthus produce lower space charge that affects the gain. Rate capability of cascaded GEMs was\ndemonstrated up to the level of 105 Hz/mm2 of 8 keV photons ( [7]). In OD4 we have been aiming\nto get the counting rate capability of up to 100kHz per 0.2mm wide channel.\nThe measurement of rate capability of OD4 was performed with 20\u03bc m wide beam of 8.3keV\nphotons aligned at the center of a channel. The beam was attenuated with 50\u03bc m thick aluminum\nfoils. In each subsequent measurement 1 foil was removed to increase the rate. Every time when the\nmeasurement with reduced number of foils was completed the additional normalizing measurement\nwas performed with 12 foils. The normalizing measurement was necessary to correct the results\nfor beam intensity variations that happened due to monochromator movements and electron beam\ninstabilities. All the measurements have been done at Vd=2580V (gain\u223c3000) and the comparator\nthreshold adjusted to provide 90% efficiency of plateau level.\nAfter the completion of all the measurements and correction on the normalizing data, the\neffective absorption of the foil has been calculated for each subsequent pair of measurements. This\nvalue has included the absorption by itself and possible additional rate reduction due to limited rate\ncapability. Then the average effective foil absorption and its variance have been calculated using\nonly the set of measurements where foil absorptions have been constant (at lower rates). The linear\nrate scale has been calculated using the rate value in the first measurement at the lowest rate and\naverage foil absorption. The relative efficiency has been obtained as the ratio of the measured rate\nand the calculated linear rate. The variance of foil absorption value has been used to calculate the\nvariance of the linear rate and the corresponding variance of the relative efficiency.\nThe result of this study is shown in Fig. 10. Within the measurement errors that have been\nmainly determined with the beam instabilities, the detector efficiency does not depend on the photons rate up to \u223c100kHz/channel. Indeed we could expect this result because the effective area\nwhere charge is produced by the X-ray beam is spread over 0.2mm*30mm=6mm2 (0.2mm is channel width, 30mm is strip length) and maximum charge rate is equivalent to only \u223c20kHz/mm2 of\n8.3keV photons at gain\u223c3000.\n\n4. Conclusion.\nFull size detector for WAXS studies has been assembled and tested at the synchrotron radiation\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fline at VEPP-3. The detector has been partially equipped with electronics that included amplifiershaper, comparator and scaler in each channel. OD4 has demonstrated stable performance with 8.3\nkeV photons in the range of gains from \u223c500 to more than 10000.\nSpatial resolution of the detector can be tuned with the comparator threshold and gas gain and\nit appeared to be simple function of efficiency when the latter is lower than 100%. For 90% efficiency the spatial resolution is \u223c470\u03bc m (FWHM of the channel response curve). Such resolution\nis enough to separate clearly the diffraction spots at an angular distance of 0.1 degree, that was\ninitially established as a main requirement for OD4. The measurements of spatial resolution and\nefficiency in a wide range of gas gains and comparator thresholds have shown that the detector can\nwork at rather low gains (below 1000) and by threshold adjustment the resolution and efficiency\ncan be chosen at optimal level. We hope that for the operation at such gains the number of GEMs\nin the cascade can be reduced to 2 or even to 1 and this will be checked in future studies.\nRate capability of OD4 was tested up to the rate of \u223c150kHz/channel. No significant degradation of efficiency has been detected.\nThe electronics that have been used for the measurements was not final. The boards that contain the amplifier-shapers and comparators will be connected to the motherboard that will collect\ndata from all the 32-channel amplifier boards, control them and communicate with the computer.\nThe first version of the final electronics including the motherboard and amplifier cards for total\nnumber of 256 channels will be ready during 2008.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.M.
