Such modelling has\nproven highly successful in implementing inflation models in the early Universe. It has however met with much\nless success in the present Universe, primarily due to the\ndifficulty of obtaining equations of state close enough to\nthe cosmological constant value w = \u22121 to satisfy observational bounds [2]. One strategy is to ensure that the\nquintessence energy density starts at such a low value\nthat the field only begins evolving close to the present,\nbut such tuning is hardly more satisfactory than a cosmological constant. The alternative is for the field to evolve\nsignificantly, ideally exploiting a 'tracker' behaviour rendering the late-time evolution almost independent of initial conditions. Unfortunately however this is viable only\nfor very particular potentials: amongst monotonic potentials, exponentials do not give acceleration and powerlaws can give negative enough w only for exponents well\nbelow 2. Among the potentials regarded as giving satisfactory phenomenology, many in fact feature a minimum\ntuned to match the observed value of the cosmological\nconstant.\nIn this paper we investigate whether this situation\nmight be alleviated by allowing the quintessence to arise\nfrom several fields, which we assume to have the same\npotential energies. While our interest is primarily phenomenological, we note that such situations may arise\nfrom higher-dimensional theories; in fact there are many\ndynamical modulus fields in string theory corresponding\nto the size of compactified dimensions. In the context\nof early Universe inflation, such a set of fields has been\nshown to give the phenomenon of assisted inflation [3],\nwhereby they may collectively drive inflation even if each\nindividual field has too steep a potential to do so on its\nown, i.e. yielding an effective equation of state closer to\nw = \u22121. It is therefore worth considering the possi-\n\nastro-ph/0506076\n\nbility of assisted quintessence behaviour, in order to see\nwhether it may be better able to match observations. Assisted quintessence is particularly attractive in the context of tracking models, as each field will separately converge onto the tracking solution making it entirely natural that they all play a dynamical role.\nIn this paper we will investigate some aspects of assisted quintessence, mostly restricting ourselves to the\nsimplest case where each field has the same potential and\nalways assuming there are no interactions between fields.\nThe most closely-related paper is that of Blais and Polarski [4], who analyzed several multi-field quintessence\nmodels both analytically and numerically, though with\na different focus directed mainly at attempting to realize models where the acceleration is a transient phenomenon. We will primarily study the exponential and\ninverse power-law cases in detail, in the former case considering different exponents for the two potentials as already extensively analyzed by Coley and van den Hoogen\n[5]. In this paper we will also provide an algorithm for\nrelating assisted quintessence to an equivalent single-field\nmodel under more general circumstances.\nOur scenario is distinct from two types of scenario already extensively investigated in the literature. One is\nthe double exponential potential models of Refs. [6, 7],\nwhere there was only a single field (Ref. [6] briefly\nmentioned a multiple-field case but not with uncoupled\nfields). Another is the two-field models of dark energy\nwhich have received some attention recently as a way of\ncrossing the cosmological constant boundary (w = \u22121) to\ngive rise to a phantom behaviour at late times [8, 9, 10].\nUnlike our case, at least one of those fields must have a\nnegative kinetic energy.\n\nII.\n\nASSISTED QUINTESSENCE\n\nIf one accepts the possibility of multiple fields, particularly sharing the same form of potential V (\u03c6i ), then\n\n\f2\nthe idea of assisted quintessence emerges very naturally\nprovided the potentials have tracker solutions for at least\nsome values of the fields. Tracker solutions arise when the\nfields are initially sub-dominant as compared to a perfect\nfluid, the field contribution to the Friedmann equation\nthen being neglected to give equations of the form\nH2 \u2243\n\n8\u03c0\n\u03c1f ,\n3m2Pl\n\n\u03c6\u0308i = \u22123H \u03c6\u0307i \u2212\n\n(1)\ndV\n,\nd\u03c6i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H is the Hubble rate, mPl is the Planck mass and a\ndot denotes the derivative with respect to a cosmic time\nt. Here the fluid density \u03c1f might for instance be broken\nup into matter and radiation components \u03c1m and \u03c1r . In\nthis set-up, the scalar fields are completely unaware of\neach other's existence (their normal channel of communication being via the Friedmann equation), and hence\nseparately evolve onto the tracker solution in response to\nthe fluid. At sufficiently-late times one would therefore\nhave all the \u03c6i equal to each other, and hence of equal\npotential energy.\nFor an individual field \u03c6 with potential V (\u03c6), whether\nor not there is tracking behaviour can be determined from\nthe value of the function\nV V \u2032\u2032\n\u0393\u2261\n,\n(3)\nV \u20322\nwhere a prime represents the derivative in terms of \u03c6.\nSolutions converge to a tracker provided that it satisfies\n\u0393 > 1 \u2212 (2 \u2212 \u03b3)/(4 + 2\u03b3) where the equation of state is\npf = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1f , the interesting case however being \u0393 > 1\nwhich is required for the field energy density to grow\nrelative to the fluid allowing eventual domination [11].\nThe convergence of different fields to the same tracking solution does not in itself amount to assisted\nquintessence, as the fields are not generating any gravitational effect on the background evolution. The convergence does however set up the initial conditions for\nsuch a behaviour. What is mainly of interest is what\nhappens once the energy density of the fields, all evolving together, is no longer subdominant, and that is the\nsituation addressed in the rest of this paper. We will\ntherefore be considering the full Friedmann equation\n!\nX\n8\u03c0\n2\n(4)\n\u03c1\u03c6 i ,\n\u03c1f +\nH =\n3m2Pl\ni\nwhere \u03c1\u03c6i \u2261 Vi (\u03c6i ) + \u03c6\u03072i /2 and we assume spatial flatness\nthroughout.\nIII.\n\nEXPONENTIAL POTENTIALS\n\nWe consider two fields \u03c61 and \u03c62 each with a separate\nexponential potential\nV (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = Ae\u2212\u03bb1 \u03ba\u03c61 + Be\u2212\u03bb2 \u03ba\u03c62\n\u2261 V1 (\u03c61 ) + V2 (\u03c62 ) ,\n\nwhere \u03ba2 \u2261 8\u03c0/m2Pl . For generality, we will allow the\npotentials to have different slopes.\n\nA.\n\nAssisted quintessence solutions\n\nFor the case where no matter is present, this system is\nexactly the original assisted inflation scenario of Liddle et\nal. [3], where the multiple fields evolve to give dynamics\nmatching a single-field model with\n1\n1\n1\n= 2 + 2.\n2\n\u03bbeff\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb2\n\n(6)\n\nFor a single-field potential V (\u03c6) = V0 e\u2212\u03bb\u03ba\u03c6 the scale factor evolves as a \u221d tp , where p = 2/\u03bb2 . Then the multifield case Eq. (6) corresponds to\nP an effective power-law\nindex given by peff \u2261 2/\u03bb2eff = pi [3]. The expansion\nrate is therefore more rapid the more fields there are.\nA particularly comprehensive analysis of multiple fields\nin exponential potentials has been given by Collinucci et\nal. [12].\nAs it happens, this assisted behaviour continues to be\nvalid in the presence of a perfect fluid with equation of\nstate p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1. This was first noted by Coley and\nvan den Hoogen [5], who also allowed for the possibility\nof spatial curvature. This is because the method used to\nrelate multi-field dynamics to an equivalent single-field\ndynamics in Ref. [3] is a property of the scalar field sector\nalone, being valid in the presence of any other matter\nsources.\n\nB.\n\nCritical points and stability\n\nThe critical points for this system were classified by\nColey and van den Hoogen [5], and we will reiterate their\nresults only briefly before embarking on some numerical\nanalysis of the evolution towards them. In Ref. [5], spatial curvature was included as a degree of freedom and\nthe fluid assumed to have \u03b3 > 1, whereas we assume\nspatial flatness and \u03b3 in the wider range 0 to 2.\nTo study the critical point structure and stability of\nthe system, it is convenient to introduce the following\ndimensionless quantities [13]\n\u221a\n\u03ba Vi\n\u03ba\u03c6\u0307i\n, yi \u2261 \u221a\n,\nxi \u2261 \u221a\n6H\n3H\n\n(5)\nThen we obtain\n\ni = 1, 2 .\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: The properties of the critical points in the presence of a barotropic fluid with 0 < \u03b3 < 2.

It is straightforward to extend our analysis to\nthe case of a dynamically changing \u03bb as studied in singlefield models in Ref. [14].\nThe classification of critical points and their stability\nis given in Table I, and agrees with results in Ref. [5].1\n\n1\n\nWe note that a full analysis has also been carried out for the case\n\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\u03b3\u03c6\n0\nUndefined\n1\n2\n1\n\u03bb21 /3\n3\u03b3/\u03bb21\n\u03b3\n1\n\u03bb22 /3\n3\u03b3/\u03bb22\n\u03b3\n1\n\u03bb2eff /3\n\u03b3\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\n\n(8)\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nThere are eight types of critical point, seven being discrete points and one a circular locus of critical points.\nThey are readily compared to the five types of critical\npoint found for the single-field system in Ref. [13]. Our\ncases 1, 2 with \u03b8 = 0 and \u03c0, 3 and 4 correspond to the\nfive points in the single-field case for the field \u03c61 , with\n\u03c62 playing no role. Our cases 1, 2 with \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and\n3\u03c0/2, 5 and 6 are the same solutions for the \u03c62 field. Finally, cases 7 and 8 are critical points in which both fields\nplay a role, and which have no direct analogue with the\nsingle-field case.\nIn the single-field case, the stable late-time attractor\nis either scalar-field dominated (case 3 or 5) or a scaling\nsolution (case 4 or 6) depending on the relative values of \u03bb\nand \u03b3 [13]. Once a second field is added, the new degrees\nof freedom always render those solutions unstable. The\nlate-time attractors instead become either the assisted\nscalar-field dominated solution case 7 (for \u03bb2eff < 3\u03b3) or\nthe assisted scaling solution case 8 (for \u03bb2eff > 3\u03b3).\nTo compare our results with Ref. [5], we note that under their assumptions the curvature always dominates the\n\nwhere one of the fields is of phantom type (opposite sign of the\nkinetic energy) [9], where the late-time behaviour is domination\nby the phantom field.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: A numerical integration for the case \u03bb1 = 2, \u03bb2 = 1.8\nand \u03b3 = 1, with initial conditions chosen so that \u03c61 dominates. Field 1 is in solid and field 2 dashed. The solution\ninitially approaches the single-field scaling solution (case 4),\nbut this becomes unstable once the second field becomes important, the late-time attractor being the multi-scalar-field\ndominated accelerating solution (case 7, \u03bbeff = 1.34). The\ndotted line shows \u2212q = \u00e4/aH 2 , where q is the deceleration\nparameter.\n\nfluid at late times, and behaves like a \u03b3 = 2/3 fluid. Accordingly, they always find solutions with non-zero fluid\ndensity to be unstable to eventual curvature domination,\nwhereas our assumption of spatial flatness renders them\nstable. Otherwise, the classification and stability shown\nin our Table matches their Tables I and III. Additionally they correctly describe the spatially-flat case in their\ntext.\n\nC.\n\nMulti-field phenomenology\n\nFor the exponential potential, the assisted quintessence\nphenomenon does indeed exist, with the extra fields being equivalent to a flatter single-field potential. Unfortunately this result does not seem particularly useful phenomenologically, as the scaling solutions do not give acceleration as required by observations, while the scalarfield dominated solutions would long ago have made the\nmatter density negligible.\nThere is however one scenario that might be of interest, which is to imagine there are a large number of exponential potentials with different initial conditions. As\nthe Universe evolves, more and more fields would join\nthe assisted quintessence attractor, reducing \u03bbeff . Eventually, this could switch the attractor from the scaling\nregime \u03bb2eff > 3\u03b3 into the regime of late-time scalar field\ndominance \u03bb2eff < 3\u03b3 [5].\nFigure 1 shows a two-field example of such evolution,\nwith the single-field scaling solution becoming unstable\nas the second field becomes important, switching the\nevolution into late-time scalar field domination. From\nTable I the first scaling regime corresponds to case 4\n\nFIG. 2: A comparison of two-field evolution for \u03bb1 = 3 and\n\u03bb2 = 1 (top) and one-field evolution for \u03bb = 1 (bottom) . The\ndensity parameters \u03a9\u03c6i and \u03a9m are shown in solid lines and\nthe equation of state parameters w\u03c6i and w in dashed lines.\nThe region around 6 < N < 11 corresponds to the scaling\nregime in which the energy density of the field \u03c61 decreases\nproportionally to that of the fluid. The present epoch is defined in each simulation as the time when the matter density\ndrops to 0.3 of critical.\n\np\n(x1 = y1 = 3/8, x2 = y2 = 0) with no acceleration,\nwhereas the final stable attractor is case 7 (x1 = 0.365,\ny1 = 0.560, x2 = 0.406, y2 = 0.623) with acceleration.\nWe checked that the values of the fixed points agree very\nwell with numerical results.\nHowever even if the initial conditions were fine-tuned\nto bring this transition into the recent past, it is hard to\nsee how the equation of state w could reach a sufficientlynegative value to be observationally viable, current observations indicating roughly w \u2261 \u03b3 \u2212 1 < \u22120.8 [2]. In\nfact, if we compare the two-field scenarios with a singlefield scenario in which\nan accelerated expansion occurs at\n\u221a\nlate times (\u03bb < 2), we find that typically the two-field\nmodels give a larger present value of w (here w is the\n\n\f5\nequation of state of scalar fields including the contribution of both \u03c61 and \u03c62 ). Figure 2 compares a two-field\nmodel with \u03bb1 = 3 and \u03bb2 = 1 against a single-field\nmodel with \u03bb = 1, in both cases with the field with slope\n1 starting with a low value and coming to dominate only\nat the present epoch (the 'thawing' regime as according\nto Ref. [15]). We see that the equation of state of the\nthawing field alone is indeed closer to \u22121 at the present\n(identified as when the matter density is 0.3 of critical)\nthan in the single-field case, but the combined w of the\ntwo fields is larger.\n\nIV.\n\nINVERSE POWER-LAW POTENTIALS\n\nWe now consider the inverse-power law case V (\u03c6) =\nV0 \u03c6\u2212\u03b2 , where we will take the same exponent and normalization for each field. Here one might hope that\nthe assisted phenomenon would give rise to an effective \u03b2eff which is smaller than the individual \u03b2, so that\nobservationally-viable models can be achieved in steeper\npotentials than the single-field case. Unfortunately that\nturns out not to be true, as we now see.\nThese potentials are favoured because they exhibit\ntracker solutions, and it is therefore legitimate to suppose\nthat after some early time we can take \u03c61 = \u03c62 = . . . \u2261 \u03c6.\nThe Friedmann and scalar wave equations become\nH2\n\nn 2\u0011\n8\u03c0 \u0010\n\u2212\u03b2\n\u03c1\n+\nnV\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03c6\u0307 ;\n=\nf\n0\n3m2Pl\n2\n\n\u03c6\u0308 = \u22123H \u03c6\u0307 + \u03b2V0 \u03c6\u2212\u03b2\u22121 ,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhere n is the number of fields. This is not yet equivalent to a single-field model, but can be made so (loosely\nfollowing the method of Ref. [3]) by the redefinitions\n\u03c7=\n\n\u221a\nn\u03c6 ;\n\nW0 =\n\n\u221a\nn\u03b2 nV0 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich then gives the equations of a single-field model\nwith potential W (\u03c7) = W0 \u03c7\u2212\u03b2 .\nThis rescaling indicates that the assisted behaviour\nrenormalizes the amplitude of the potential in this case,\nbut does not renormalize its exponent. In such models\nthe amplitude has to be adjusted in order to give the\npresent-day value of the matter density \u03a9m , and having\ndone that the multi-field system then has identical dynamics to the single-field model, in particular predicting\nthe same present-day value of the equation of state w.\n\nV.\n\nASSISTED QUINTESSENCE DYNAMICS\n\nWe end with a more general construction for analyzing\nassisted quintessence, extending the analysis of the previous section to the case where the potential is arbitrary,\nbut the same for all fields. Again we assume tracking\n\nbehaviour so that we can take \u03c6i = \u03c6, giving\n8\u03c0 h\nn 2i\nH2 =\n\u03c1\n+\nnV\n(\u03c6)\n+\n\u03c6\u0307 ,\nf\n3m2Pl\n2\ndV\n\u03c6\u0308 = \u22123H \u03c6\u0307 \u2212\n.\nd\u03c6\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nTo find an equivalent single-field system, we first note\nthat the kinetic term in the Friedmann equation forces\nthe correspondence\n\u221a\n(19)\n\u03c7 = n\u03c6.\nThe equations can then be transformed into single-field\nform with potential\n\u221a\nW (\u03c7) = nV (\u03c7/ n) ,\n(20)\nwhich obviously has the desired effect in the Friedmann\nequation, but which also renders the fluid equation into\nsingle-field form. This formula therefore represents an\nalgorithm for finding a single-field potential W which will\ngenerate the same evolution as multiple fields evolving\ntogether in the potential V .\nFor simplicity, we henceforth consider the two-field\ncase, though the generalization is straightforward. The\ncorrespondence then is\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(21)\n\u03c7 = 2 \u03c6 ; W (\u03c7) = 2V (\u03c7/ 2) .\nThis allows us to ask what condition would have to be\nsatisfied in order to have no assisted behaviour, i.e. for\nW and V have the same functional form apart from an\noverall constant. This happens for potentials obeying the\ncondition\n\u221a\n(22)\nV (\u03c7) = 2CV (\u03c7/ 2) ,\nfor all \u03c7, where C is a constant. The general solution to\nthis equation is\nV (\u03c7) \u221d \u03c7\u2212\u03b2 \u00d7 f (\u03c7) ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere\n\u221a f (\u03c7) is any function periodic in ln \u03c7 with period\nln 2 (i.e. a Fourier series with this periodicity). While\nthis can be any of an infinite class of potentials, having\nsuch a periodicity is clearly artificial. The only interesting case therefore is f (\u03c7) equals a constant, giving\nthe power-law potential. This proves that the inverse\npower-law potentials are the unique monotonic potentials\nwhich do not exhibit assisted quintessence behaviour. In\nall other cases, the equivalent single-field potential has a\ndifferent functional form. In the exponential case this algorithm correctly reproduces Eq. (6) for the case \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 .\nAs a final point, we note that under the correspondence\nEq. (20), the tracking parameter \u0393W \u2261 W W \u2032\u2032 /W \u20322 is\nequal to \u0393V = V V \u2032\u2032 /V \u20322 (the primes here being derivatives wrt the arguments \u03c7 and \u03c6 respectively). As one\nwould expect, the tracking conditions on the multi-field\nmodel and its single-field dynamical equivalent are the\nsame.\n\n\f6\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have studied various aspects of assisted\nquintessence dynamics. Such dynamics arises naturally if there are several fields with the same potential,\nprovided the potential exhibits tracking behaviour for at\nleast some stage of its early evolution.\nOur most powerful result is Eq. (20), which provides a general algorithm for finding a single-field model\nwhich mimics the dynamics of a multi-field assisted\nquintessence model. Applied to inverse power-law models, it shows that they are the unique (monotonic) potentials for which there is no assisted behaviour, the collection of fields behaving as a single field in the same\npotential (up to overall normalization). All other potentials will exhibit assisted behaviour, the exponential\npotential being an explicit example.\nIt should be possible to extend our analysis to the case\nof more general dark energy models in which the Lagrangian includes non-canonical kinematic terms, such\nas the tachyon, k-essence and ghost condensate.
