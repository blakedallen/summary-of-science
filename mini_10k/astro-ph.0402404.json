The bulk properties and the\ninternal structure of these stars chiefly depends upon the equation of state (EOS) of dense\nhadronic matter. Different models for the EOS of dense matter predict a neutron star\nmaximum mass (Mmax ) in the range of 1.4 \u2013 2.2 M\u2299 , and a corresponding central density\n1\n\nDipartimento di Fisica \"Enrico Fermi\", Universit\u00e1 di Pisa, and INFN Sezione Pisa, via Buonarroti 2,\nI-56127 Pisa, Italy.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nin range of 4 \u2013 8 times the saturation density (\u03c10 \u223c 2.8 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 ) of nuclear matter (e.g.\nShapiro & Teukolsky 1983; Haensel 2003). In the case of a star with M \u223c 1.4 M\u2299 , different\nEOS models predict a radius in the range of 7 \u2013 16 km (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983; Haensel\n2003; Dey et al. 1998).\nIn a simplistic and conservative picture the core of a neutron star is modeled as a uniform\nfluid of neutron rich nuclear matter in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction (\u03b2stable nuclear matter). However, due to the large value of the stellar central density and to\nthe rapid increase of the nucleon chemical potentials with density, hyperons (\u039b, \u03a3\u2212 , \u03a30 , \u03a3+ ,\n\u039e\u2212 and \u039e0 particles) are expected to appear in the inner core of the star. Other exotic phases\nof hadronic matter such as a Bose-Einstein condensate of negative pion (\u03c0 \u2212 ) or negative kaon\n(K \u2212 ) could be present in the inner part of the star.\nAccording to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase should occur at a density of a few times nuclear matter\nsaturation density. Consequently, the core of the more massive neutron stars is one of the\nbest candidates in the Universe where such deconfined phase of quark matter (QM) could\nbe found. This possibility was realized by several researchers soon after the introduction of\nquarks as the fundamentals building blocks of hadrons (Ivanenko & Kurdgelaidze 1969; Itoh\n1970; Iachello et al. 1974; Collins & Perry 1975; Baym & Chin 1976; Keister & Kisslinger\n1976). Since \u03b2-stable hadronic matter posses two conserved \"charges\" (i.e., electric charge\nand baryon number) the quark-deconfinement phase transition proceeds through a mixed\nphase over a finite range of pressures and densities according to the Gibbs' criterion for\nphase equilibrium (Glendenning 1992; M\u00fcller & Serot 1995). At the onset of the mixed\nphase, quark matter droplets form a Coulomb lattice embedded in a sea of hadrons and in\na roughly uniform sea of electrons and muons. As the pressure increases various geometrical shapes (rods, plates) of the less abundant phase immersed in the dominant one are\nexpected. Finally the system turns into uniform quark matter at the highest pressure of\nthe mixed phase (Heiselberg et al. 1993; Voskresensky et al. 2003). Compact stars which\npossess a \"quark matter core\" either as a mixed phase of deconfined quarks and hadrons\nor as a pure quark matter phase are called Hybrid Neutron Stars or shortly Hybrid Stars\n(HyS) (Glendenning 1996; Drago & Lavagno 2001). In the following of this paper, the more\nconventional neutron stars in which no fraction of quark matter is present, will be referred\nto as pure Hadronic Stars (HS).\nEven more intriguing than the existence of a quark core in a neutron star, is the possible\nexistence of a new family of compact stars consisting completely of a deconfined mixture of\nup (u), down (d) and strange (s) quarks (together with an appropriate number of electrons\nto guarantee electrical neutrality) satisfying the Bodmer\u2013Witten hypothesis (Bodmer 1971;\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWitten 1984; see also Terazawa 1979). Such compact stars have been called strange quark\nstars or shortly strange stars (SS) (Alcock et al. 1986; Haensel et al. 1986) and their\nconstituent matter as strange quark matter (SQM) (Farhi & Jaffe 1984; Madsen 1999).\nPresently there is no unambiguous proof about the existence of strange stars, however, a\nsizable amount of observational data collected by the new generations of X-ray satellites,\nis providing a growing body of evidence for their possible existence (Bombaci 1997; Cheng\net al. 1998; Li et al. 1999a; Li et al. 1999b; Xu 2002; Drake et al. 2002). It is generally\nbelieved that the unambiguous identification of a strange star will imply that all pulsars must\nbe strange stars. In the present work we argue that the possible existence of strange stars\ndoes not conflict with the existence of conventional neutron stars (pure Hadronic Stars).\nPresent accurate determinations of compact star masses in radio pulsar binaries (Thorsett\n& Chakrabarty 1999) permit to rule out only extremely soft EOS, i.e. those giving Mmax\nless than about 1.45 M\u2299 . However, in at least two accreting X-ray binaries it has been\nfound evidence for compact stars with higher masses. The first of these star is Vela X-1,\nwith a reported mass 1.88 \u00b1 0.13M\u2299 (Quaintrell et al. 2003), the second is Cygnus X-2,\nwith a reported mass of 1.78 \u00b1 0.23M\u2299 (Orosz & Kuulkers 1999). Unfortunately, mass determinations in X-ray binaries are affected by large uncertainties (van Kerkwijk et al. 1995),\ntherefore the previous quoted \"high mass values\" should always be handled with care. In\naddition to mass determination, existing observational data on the spin frequency of millisecond pulsars and on the thermal evolution of neutron stars do not put severe constraints\non the EOS of dense matter. Fortunately, this situation is improving in the last few years.\nIn fact, the extraordinary spectroscopic capabilities of the instruments on board Chandra\nX-ray and XMM-Newton satellites, are giving the unique possibility to perform accurate\nmeasurements of the gravitational red-shift in the spectral lines of a few compact X-ray\nsources. This provide informations on the mass to radius ratio for compact stars and will\nhelp us to understand the true nature of these compact objects.\nIn this work we study the effects of the hadron-quark deconfinement phase transition in\nstellar compact objects. We show that when finite size effects at the interface between the\nquark- and the hadron-phase are taken into account, pure Hadronic Stars, above a threshold\nvalue of the central pressure (gravitational mass), are metastable to the decay (conversion)\nto hybrid neutron stars or to strange stars (depending on the properties of EOS for quark\nmatter). The mean-life time of the metastable stellar configuration is related to the quantum\nnucleation time to form a drop of quark matter in the stellar center, and dramatically\ndepends on the value of the stellar central pressure. We explore the consequences of the\nmetastability of \"massive\" pure Hadronic Stars and the existence of stable compact quark\nstars (hybrid neutron stars or strange stars) on the concept of limiting mass of compact stars.\nNext, we discuss the implications of our scenario in the interpretation of the mass-radius\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nconstraints extracted from the spectra of several X-ray compact sources. Finally, we discuss\nthe implications of our scenario for Gamma Ray Bursts.\n\n2.\n\nQuantum nucleation of quark matter in hadronic stars\n\nNucleation of quark matter in neutron stars has been studied by many authors. Most\nof the earlier studies on this subject (Horvath et al. 1992; Horvath 1994; Olesen & Madsen\n1994; Heiselberg 1995; Grassi 1998) have been restricted to the case of thermal nucleation in\nhot and dense hadronic matter. In these studies, it was found that the prompt formation of\na critical size drop of quark matter via thermal activation is possible above a temperature of\nabout 2 \u2013 3 MeV. As a consequence, it was inferred that pure hadronic stars are converted\nto strange stars or to hybrid stars within the first seconds after their birth. It was also\nsuggested that the large amount of energy liberated in this process could play a crucial role\nin type-II supernova explosions (Benvenuto & Horvath 1989).\nAll the studies on quark matter nucleation mentioned above, have neglected an important physical aspect which charecterizes dense matter in a newly born neutron star : the\ntrapping of neutrinos in the stellar core. Neutrino trapping has a sizeable influence on the\nstiffness of the EOS and, consequently, on the structural properties of the protoneutron star\n(Bombaci 1996; Prakash et al. 1997). In particular, it has been found that neutrino trapping\nsignificantly shifts the critical baryon density for the quark deconfinement phase transition\nto higher values with respect to the neutrino-free case (Prakash et al. 1997; Lugones &\nBenvenuto 1998). In addition, neutrino trapping decreases the value of the central density\nof the stellar maximum mass configuration with respect to the neutrino-free case (Prakash\net al. 1997). Thus, the formation of a metastable supercompressed phase of hadronic matter\nis strongly inhibited in a protoneutron star. A detailed study of quark matter nucleation in\nhot and dense hadronic matter with trapped neutrinos will be presented in a forthcoming\nwork (Bombaci et al. 2004).\nIn the present paper, we assume that the compact star survives the early stages of its\nevolution as a pure hadronic star, and we study quark matter nucleation in cold (T = 0)\nneutrino-free hadronic matter.\nIn bulk matter the quark-hadron mixed phase begins at the static transition point defined\naccording to the Gibbs' criterion for phase equilibrium\n\u03bcH = \u03bcQ \u2261 \u03bc0 ,\n\nPH (\u03bc0 ) = PQ (\u03bc0 ) \u2261 P0\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwhere\n\u03bcH =\n\n\u03b5 H + PH\n,\nnb,H\n\n\u03bcQ =\n\n\u03b5 Q + PQ\nnb,Q\n\n(2)\n\nare the chemical potentials for the hadron and quark phase respectively, \u03b5H (\u03b5Q ), PH (PQ )\nand nb,H (nb,Q ) denote respectively the total (i.e., including leptonic contributions) energy\ndensity, the total pressure and baryon number density for the hadron (quark) phase, in the\ncase of cold matter.\nLet us now consider the more realistic situation in which one takes into account the\nenergy cost due to finite size effects in creating a drop of deconfined quark matter in the\nhadronic environment. As a consequence of these effects, the formation of a critical-size\ndrop of QM is not immediate and it is necessary to have an overpressure \u2206P = P \u2212 P0 with\nrespect to the static the transition point. Thus, above P0 , hadronic matter is in a metastable\nstate, and the formation of a real drop of quark matter occurs via a quantum nucleation\nmechanism. A sub-critical (virtual) droplet of deconfined quark matter moves back and\nforth in the potential energy well separating the two matter phases (see discussion below)\non a time scale \u03bd0\u22121 \u223c 10\u221223 seconds, which is set by the strong interactions. This time scale\nis many orders of magnitude shorter than the typical time scale for the weak interactions,\ntherefore quark flavor must be conserved during the deconfinement transition. We will refer\nto this form of deconfined matter, in which the flavor content is equal to that of the \u03b2-stable\nhadronic system at the same pressure, as the Q*-phase. Soon afterwards a critical size drop\nof quark matter is formed the weak interactions will have enough time to act, changing the\nquark flavor fraction of the deconfined droplet to lower its energy, and a droplet of \u03b2-stable\nSQM is formed (hereafter the Q-phase). For example, if quark deconfinement occurs in \u03b2stable nuclear matter (non-strange hadronic matter), it will produce a two-flavor (u and d )\nquark matter droplet having\nnu /nd = (1 + xp )/(2 \u2212 xp ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nnu and nd being the up and down quark number densities respectively, and xp the proton\nfraction in the \u03b2-stable hadronic phase. In the more general case in which the hadronic\nphase has a strangeness content (e.g., hyperonic matter), the deconfinement transition will\nform a droplet of strange matter with a flavor content equal to that of the \u03b2-stable hadronic\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsystem at the same pressure, according to the relation:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\nxu\n2 1 1 2 1 0 1 0 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed xd \uf8f8 = \uf8ed 1 2 1 0 1 2 0 1 \uf8f8 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nxs\n0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nxp\nxn\nx\u039b\nx\u03a3+\nx\u03a30\nx\u03a3\u2212\nx\u039e0\nx\u039e\u2212\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(4)\n\nwhere xi = ni /nb are the concentrations of the different particle species.\nIn the present work, we have adopted rather common models for describing both the\nhadronic and the quark phase of dense matter. For the hadronic phase we used models which\nare based on a relativistic lagrangian of hadrons interacting via the exchange of sigma,\nrho and omega mesons. The parameters adopted are the standard ones (Glendenning &\nMoszkowski 1991). Hereafter we refer to this model as the GM equation of state (EOS).\nFor the quark phase we have adopted a phenomenological EOS (Farhi & Jaffe 1984) which\nis based on the MIT bag model for hadrons. The parameters here are: the mass ms of the\nstrange quark, the so-called pressure of the vacuum B (bag constant) and the QCD structure\nconstant \u03b1s . For all the quark matter model used in the present work, we take mu = md = 0,\nms = 150 MeV and \u03b1s = 0.\nIn the left panel of Fig. 1, we show the chemical potentials, defined according to Eq. (2),\nas a function of the total pressure for the three phases of matter (H, Q*, and Q) discussed\nabove. In the right panel of the same figure, we plot the energy densities for the H- and\nQ-phase as a function of the corresponding baryon number densities. Both panels in Fig. 1\nare relative to the GM3 model for the EOS for the H-phase and to the MIT bag model EOS\nfor the Q and Q* phases with B = 152.45 MeV/fm3 .\nTo calculate the nucleation rate of quark matter in the hadronic medium we use the\nLifshitz\u2013Kagan quantum nucleation theory (Lifshitz & Kagan 1972) in the relativistic form\ngiven by Iida & Sato (1997). The QM droplet is supposed to be a sphere of radius R and\nits quantum fluctuations are described by the lagrangian\nq\n2\nL(R, \u1e58) = \u2212M(R)c 1 \u2212 (\u1e58/c)2 + M(R)c2 \u2212 U(R) ,\n(5)\nwhere M(R) is the effective mass of the QM droplet, and U(R) its potential energy. Within\nthe Lifshitz\u2013Kagan quantum nucleation theory, one assumes that the phase boundary (i.e.\nthe droplet surface) moves slowly compared to the high sound velocity of the medium (\u1e58 <<\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nvs \u223c c). Thus the number density of each phase adjust adiabatically to the fluctuations of\nthe droplet radius, and the system retains pressure equilibrium between the two phases.\nThus, the droplet effective mass is given by (Lifshitz & Kagan 1972; Iida & Sato 1997)\n\u0010\nnb,Q\u2217 \u00112 3\nR ,\n(6)\nM(R) = 4\u03c0\u03c1H 1 \u2212\nnb,H\n\u03c1H being the hadronic mass density, nb,H and nb,Q\u2217 are the baryonic number densities at a\nsame pressure in the hadronic and Q*-phase, respectively. The potential energy is given by\n(Lifshitz & Kagan 1972; Iida & Sato 1997)\n4\nU(R) = \u03c0R3 nb,Q\u2217 (\u03bcQ\u2217 \u2212 \u03bcH ) + 4\u03c0\u03c3R2 + 8\u03c0\u03b3R ,\n(7)\n3\nwhere \u03bcH and \u03bcQ\u2217 are the hadronic and quark chemical potentials at a fixed pressure P and\n\u03c3 is the surface tension for the surface separating the quark phase from the hadronic phase.\nThe value of the surface tension \u03c3 is poorly known, and typical values used in the literature\nrange within 10\u201350 MeV/fm2 (Heiselberg et al. 1993; Iida & Sato 1997). The third term\nin Eq. (7), Ecurv = 8\u03c0\u03b3R, is the so called curvature energy. It has been shown that Ecurv\nplays an important role in the thermal nucleation process of quark matter in hot hadronic\nmatter (Horvath 1994; Olesen & Madsen 1994). Specifically, the curvature term increases\nthe minimum temperature for thermal nucleation with respect to the case \u03b3 = 0 (Horvath\n1994). Most of the results reported in the present study have been obtained taking \u03b3 = 0 in\nEq. (7). In a few cases (see Tab. 3), we considered \u03b3 6= 0 to investigate the influence of the\ncurvature energy on quantum nucleation in cold hadronic matter.\nIn the previous expression (7) for the droplet potential energy, we neglected the terms\nconnected with the electrostatic energy. Detailed calculations by Iida & Sato (1997) have\ndemonstrated that the contribution of these terms to Eq. (7) can be safely omitted since the\nscreening action by leptons nearly compensate the effect of the positive charged droplet.\nThe process of formation of a bubble having a critical radius, can be computed using a\nsemiclassical approximation. The procedure is rather straightforward. First one computes,\nusing the well known Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin (WKB) approximation, the ground state\nenergy E0 and the oscillation frequency \u03bd0 of the virtual QM drop in the potential well U(R).\nThen it is possible to calculate in a relativistic framework the probability of tunneling as\n(Iida & Sato 1997)\nh A(E ) i\n0\n(8)\np0 = exp \u2212\n~\nwhere A is the action under the potential barrier\nZ\n2 R+ \b\n[2M(R)c2 + E \u2212 U(R)] \u00d7 [U(R) \u2212 E]\nA(E) =\nc R\u2212\n\n1/2\n\ndR ,\n\n(9)\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nR\u00b1 being the classical turning points.\nThe nucleation time is then equal to\n\u03c4 = (\u03bd0 p0 Nc )\u22121 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Nc is the number of virtual centers of droplet formation in the innermost region of\nthe star. Following the simple estimate given in Iida & Sato (1997), we take Nc = 1048 . The\nuncertainty in the value of Nc is expected to be within one or two orders of magnitude. In\nany case, all the qualitative features of our scenario will be not affected by the uncertainty\nin the value of Nc .\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nTo begin with we show in Fig. 2 the typical mass-radius (MR) relations for the three\npossible types of compact stars discussed before. The curve labeled with HS represents\nthe MR relation for pure hadronic stars containing an hyperonic core obtained with the\nGM3 model for the EOS of dense matter. The curve labeled HyS depicts the MR relation\nfor hybrid neutron stars where the hadronic phase is described by the same GM3 model\nfor the EOS and the quark phase by the MIT-bag like model with B = 136.62 MeV/fm3 .\nFinally, if we assume, for example, B = 69.47 MeV/fm3 (with the remaining parameters for\nquark phase unchanged with respect to the previous case), SQM fulfils the Bodmer-Witten\nhypothesis and one has the strange star sequence depicted by the curve SS in Fig. 2. As it\nappears, stars having a deconfined quark content (HyS or SS) are more compact than purely\nhadronic stars (HS).\nIn our scenario, we consider a purely hadronic star whose central pressure is increasing\ndue to spin-down or due to mass accretion, e.g., from the material left by the supernova\nexplosion (fallback disc), from a companion star or from the interstellar medium. As the\ncentral pressure exceeds the threshold value P0\u2217 at the static transition point, a virtual drop\nof quark matter in the Q*-phase can be formed in the central region of the star. As soon as\na real drop of Q*-matter is formed, it will grow very rapidly and the original Hadronic Star\nwill be converted to and Hybrid Star or to a Strange Star, depending on the detail of the\nEOS for quark matter employed to model the phase transition (particularly depending on\nthe value of the parameter B within the model adopted in the present study).\nAs an illustrative example, we plot in Fig. 3 the potential energy U(R) for the formation\nof a quark matter droplet for different values of the stellar central pressure Pc above the static\ntransition point P0\u2217 . The curves in Fig. 3 are relative to a given set of EOS for the two phases\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nof dense matter (see figure caption), to a fixed value of the surface tension \u03c3 and to the case\n\u03b3 = 0.\nAs expected the potential barrier is lowered as central pressure increases.\nThe nucleation time \u03c4 , i.e., the time needed to form a critical droplet of deconfined\nquark matter, can be calculated for different values of the stellar central pressure Pc which\nenters in the expression of the energy barrier in Eq. (7). The nucleation time can be plotted\nas a function of the gravitational mass MHS of the HS corresponding to the given value of the\ncentral pressure, as implied by the solution of the Tolmann-Oppeneimer-Volkov equations for\nthe pure Hadronic Star sequences. The results of our calculations are reported in Fig. 4 and\nin Fig. 5 which are relative respectively to the GM1 and GM3 EOS for the hadronic phase.\nEach curve refers to a different value of the bag constant and the surface tension. As we can\nsee, from the results in Fig.s 4 and 5, a metastable hadronic star can have a mean-life time\nmany orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe Tuniv = (13.7 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 109 yr\n= (4.32 \u00b10.06) \u00d71017 s (Spergel et al. 2003). As the star accretes a small amount of mass (of\nthe order of a few per cent of the mass of the sun), the consequential increase of the central\npressure lead to a huge reduction of the nucleation time and, as a result, to a dramatic\nreduction of the HS mean-life time.\nTo summarize, in the present scenario pure hadronic stars having a central pressure\nlarger than the static transition pressure for the formation of the Q*-phase are metastable\nto the \"decay\" (conversion) to a more compact stellar configuration in which deconfined\nquark matter is present (i.e., HyS or SS). These metastable HS have a mean-life time which\nis related to the nucleation time to form the first critical-size drop of deconfined matter in\ntheir interior (the actual mean-life time of the HS will depend on the mass accretion or on\nthe spin-down rate which modifies the nucleation time via an explicit time dependence of the\nstellar central pressure). We define as critical mass Mcr of the metastable HS, the value of the\ngravitational mass for which the nucleation time is equal to one year: Mcr \u2261 MHS (\u03c4 = 1yr).\nPure hadronic stars with MH > Mcr are very unlikely to be observed. Mcr plays the role of\nan effective maximum mass for the hadronic branch of compact stars (see the discussion in\nsubsection 3.1). While the Oppenheimer\u2013Volkov maximum mass MHS,max (Oppenheimer &\nVolkov 1939) is determined by the overall stiffness of the EOS for hadronic matter, the value\nof Mcr will depend in addition on the bulk properties of the EOS for quark matter and on\nthe properties at the interface between the confined and deconfined phases of matter (e.g.,\nthe surface tension \u03c3).\nTo explore how the outcome of our scenario depends on the details of the stellar matter\nEOS, we have considered two different parameterizations (GM1 and GM3) for the EOS\nof the hadronic phase, and we have varied the value of the bag constant B. Moreover,\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nwe have considered two different values for the surface tension: \u03c3 = 10 MeV/fm2 and\n\u03c3 = 30 MeV/fm2 (taking \u03b3 = 0 in both cases). These results are summarized in Tab. 1\n(GM1 EOS) and in Tab. 2 (GM3 EOS)\nIn Fig. 6 and 7, we show the MR curve for pure HS within the GM1 and GM3 models\nfor the EOS of the hadronic phase, and that for hybrid stars or strange stars for different\nvalues of the bag constant B. The configuration marked with an asterisk on the hadronic\nMR curves represents the hadronic star for which the central pressure is equal to P0\u2217 . The\nfull circle on the hadronic star sequence represents the critical mass configuration, in the case\n\u03c3 = 30 MeV/fm2 and \u03b3 = 0. The full circle on the HyS (SS) mass-radius curve represents\nthe hybrid (strange) star which is formed from the conversion of the hadronic star with\nMHS = Mcr . We assume (Bombaci & Datta 2000) that during the stellar conversion process\nthe total number of baryons in the star (or in other words the stellar baryonic mass) is\nconserved. Thus the total energy liberated in the stellar conversion is given by the difference\nbetween the gravitational mass of the initial hadronic star (Min \u2261 Mcr ) and that of the final\nb\nhybrid or strange stellar configuration with the same baryonic mass (Mf in \u2261 MQS (Mcr\n) ):\nEconv = (Min \u2212 Mf in )c2 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe stellar conversion process, described so far, will start to populate the new branch\nof quark stars (the part of the QS sequence plotted as a continuous curve in Fig.s 6 and 7).\nLong term accretion on the QS can next produce stars with masses up to the limiting mass\nMQS,max for the quark star configurations.\nAs we can see from the results reported in Tab. 1 and 2, within the present model for\nthe EOS, we can distinguish several ranges for the value of the bag constant, which gives\na different astrophysical output for our scenario. To be more specific, in Fig. 8 we plot the\nmaximum mass of the QS sequence, the critical mass and the corresponding final mass Mf in\nas a function of B, in the particular case of the GM3 model for the EOS of the hadronic\nphase and taking \u03c3 = 30MeV/fm2 and \u03b3 = 0. Let us start the following discussion from\n\"high\" values of B down to the minimum possible value B V (\u223c 57.5MeV/fm3 for \u03b1s = 0) for\nwhich atomic nuclei will be unstable to the decay to a drop of deconfined u,d quark matter\n(non-strange QM) (Farhi & Jaffe 1984).\n(1) B > B I .\nThese \"high\" values of the bag constant do not allow the quark\ndeconfinement to occur in the maximum mass hadronic star either. Here B I denotes the\nvalue of the bag constant for which the central density of the maximum mass hadronic star\nis equal to the critical density for the beginning of the mixed quark-hadron phase. For these\nvalues of B, all compact stars are pure hadronic stars.\n(2) B II < B < B I .\n\nNow, in addition to pure HS, there is a new branch of compact\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nstars, the hybrid stars; but the nucleation time \u03c4 (MHS,max ) to form a droplet of Q*-matter\nin the maximum mass hadronic star, is of the same order or much larger than the age of\nthe Universe. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely to populate the hybrid star branch. Once\nagain, the compact star we can observe are, in this case, pure HS.\n(3) B III < B < B II .\nIn this case, the critical mass for the pure hadronic star\nsequence is less than the maximum mass for the same stellar sequence, i.e., Mcr < MHS,max .\nNevertheless (for the present EOS model), the baryonic mass M b (Mcr ) of the hadronic star\nb\nwith the critical mass is larger than the maximum baryonic mass MQS,max\nof the hybrid star\nsequence. In this case, the formation of a critical size droplet of deconfined matter in the\ncore of the hadronic star with the critical mass, will trigger off a stellar conversion process\nwhich will produce, at the end, a black hole (see cases marked as \"BH\" in Tab. 1 and Tab.\n2). As in the previous case, it is extremely unlikely to populate the hybrid star branch. The\ncompact star predicted by these EOS models are pure HS. Hadronic stars with a gravitational\nb\nb\nmass in the range MHS (MQS,max\n) < MHS < Mcr (where MQS,max\nis the baryonic mass of the\nmaximum mass configuration for the hybrid star sequence) are metastable with respect to a\nconversion to a black hole.\nb\n(4) B IV < B < B III . For these values of B one has Mcr < MHS (MQS,max\n) . There\nare now two different branches of compact stars: pure hadronic stars with MHS < Mcr , and\nb\nb\nhybrid stars with MQS (Mcr\n) < MQS < MQS,max (here MQS (Mcr\n) \u2261 Mf in is the gravitational\nmass of the hybrid star with the same baryoinic mass of the critical mass hadronic star).\n\n(5) B V < B < B IV . Finally, as B falls below the value B IV , the Bodmer-Witten\nhypothesis starts to be fulfilled. Now the stable quark stars formed in the stellar conversion\nprocess are strange stars.\nTo examine the influence of the curvature energy on the quantum nucleation process, we\nhave performed some calculations of the nucleation time taking \u03b3 6= 0 in Eq. (7). We have\nused the two values, \u03b3 = 10 MeV/fm and \u03b3 = 20 MeV/fm, according to the existing estimates\nof the curvature coefficient in the case of the quark-hadron phase transition (Madsen 1993;\nHorvath 1994; Olesen & Madsen 1994). As expected, for a fixed value of the stellar central\npressure, the curvature term suppresses quark matter nucleation. As a consequence, the\ncritical mass Mcr and the total energy released in the stellar conversion process are increasesd\nwith respect to the case \u03b3 = 0, as it can be seen looking at the results reported in Tab. 3.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.1.\n\nThe limiting mass of compact stars\n\nThe possibility to have metastable hadronic stars, together with the feasible existence\nof two distinct families of compact stars, demands an extension of the concept of maximum\nmass of a \"neutron star\" with respect to the classical one introduced by Oppenheimer &\nVolkoff (1939). Since metastable HS with a \"short\" mean-life time are very unlikely to\nbe observed, the extended concept of maximum mass must be introduced in view of the\ncomparison with the values of the mass of compact stars deduced from direct astrophysical\nobservation. Having in mind this operational definition, we call limiting mass of a compact\nstar, and denote it as Mlim , the physical quantity defined in the following way:\n(a) if the nucleation time \u03c4 (MHS,max ) associated to the maximum mass configuration for the\nhadronic star sequence is of the same order or much larger than the age of the universe Tuniv ,\nthen\nMlim = MHS,max ,\n(12)\nin other words, the limiting mass in this case coincides with the Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff maximum mass for the hadronic star sequence.\n(b) If the critical mass Mcr is smaller than MHS,max (i.e. \u03c4 (MHS,max ) < 1 yr), thus the\nlimiting mass for compact stars is equal to the largest value between the critical mass for\nthe HS and the maximum mass for the quark star (HyS or SS) sequence\nMlim = max[Mcr , MQS,max ] .\n\n(13)\n\n(c) Finally, one must consider an \"intermediate\" situation for which 1yr < \u03c4 (MHS,max ) <\nTuniv . As the reader can easely realize, now\nMlim = max[MHS,max , MQS,max ] ,\n\n(14)\n\ndepending on the details of the EOS which could give MHS,max > MQS,max or vice versa.\nIn Fig. 9, we show the limiting mass Mlim calculated in the case of the GM1+Bag model\n(dashed line) and in the case of the GM3+Bag model (continuous line) as a function of the\nbag constant B. In the same figure, we compare our theoretical determination for Mlim\nwith some of the \"measured\" masses of compact stars in radio pulsar binaries (Thorsett &\nChakrabarty 1999) and for the compact stars Vela X-1 (Quaintrell et al. 2003) and Cygnus\nX-2 (Orosz & Kuulkers 1999).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n4.\n\nMass-to-radius ratio and internal constitution of compact stars\n\nAn accurate measure of the radius and the mass of an individual \"neutron star\" will\nrepresent the key to open the safety deposit which contains the secrets of the internal constitution of these puzzling astrophysical bodies and to discriminate between different models\nfor the equation of state of dense hadronic matter. Unfortunately such a crucial information\nis still not available. A decisive step in such a direction has been done thanks to the instruments on board of the last generation of X-ray satellites. These are providing a large amount\nof fresh and accurate observational data, which are giving us the possibility to extract very\ntight constraints on the radius and the mass for some compact stars.\nThe analysis of different astrophysical phenomena associated with compact X-ray sources,\nseems to indicate in some case the existence of neutron stars with \"large\" radii in the range\nof 12 \u2013 20 km and in some other cases the existence of compact stars with \"small\" radii in\nthe range of 6 \u2013 9 km (Bombaci 1997; Li et al. 1999a; Poutanen & Gierlinski 2003; Bombaci\n2003). Clearly, this possibility is a natural outcome of our scenario, where two different\nfamilies of compact stars, the pure hadronic stars and the quark stars (HyS or SS), may\nexist in the universe.\nIn the following of this section, we will consider some of the most recent constraints on\nthe mass-to-radius ratio for compact stars extracted from the observational data for a few\nX-ray sources, and we will try make an interpretation of these results within our scenario.\nIn Fig. 10, we report the radius an the mass of the compact star RX J1856.5-3754\ninferred by Walter & Lattimer (2002) (see also Kaplan et al. 2002) from the fit of the\nfull spectral energy distribution for this isolated radio-quite \"neutron star\", after a revised\nparallax determination (Kaplan et al. 2002) which implies a distance to the source of 117 \u00b1\n12 pc. Comparing the mass-radius box for RX J1856.5-3754 reported in Fig. 10 with the\ntheoretical determination of the MR relation for different equations of state, one concludes\nthat RX J1856.5-3754 could be (see e.g. Fig. 2 in Walter & Lattimer, 2002) either an\nhadronic star or an hybrid or strange star (see also Drake et al. 2002).\nNext we consider the compact star in the low mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34. In a very\nrecent paper Shaposhnikov et al. (2003) (hereafter STH) have analyzed a set of 26 Type-I\nX-ray bursts for this source. The data were collected by the Proportional Counter Array\non board of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. For the interpretation of\nthese observational data Shaposhnikov et al. 2003 used a model of the X-ray burst spectral\nformation developed by Titarchuk (1994) and Shaposhnikov & Titarchuk 2002. Within this\nmodel, STH were able to extract very stringent constrain on the radius and the mass of the\ncompact star in this bursting source. The radius and mass for 4U 1728-34, extracted by STH\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nfor different best-fits of the burst data, are depicted in Fig. 10 by the filled squares. Each\nof the four MR points is relative to a different value of the distance to the source (d = 4.0,\n4.25, 4.50, 4.75 kpc, for the fit which produces the smallest values of the mass, up to the one\nwhich gives the largest mass). The error bars on each point represent the error contour for\n90% confidence level. It has been pointed out (Bombaci 2003) that the semi-empirical MR\nrelation for the compact star in 4U 1728-34 obtained by STH is not compatible with models\npure hadronic stars, while it is consistent with strange stars or hybrid stars.\nAssuming RX J1856.5-3754 to be a pure hadronic star and 4U 1728-34 an hybrid or a\nstrange star, we see from our results plotted in Fig. 10, that this possibility can be realized as\na natural consequence of our scenario. Thus, we find that the existence of quark stars (with\n\"small\" radii) does not exclude the possible existence of pure hadronic stars (with \"large\"\nradii), and vice versa.\nDecisive informations on the mass-to-radius ratio can be provided by measuring the\ngravitational redshift of lines in the spectrum emitted from the compact star atmosphere.\nVery recently, redshifted spectral lines features have been reported for two different X-ray\nsources (Cottam et al. 2002; Sanwal et al. 2002). The first of these sources is the compact\nstar in the low mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676. Studing the spectra of 28 type-I X-ray\nbursts in EXO 0748-676, Cottam et al. (2002) have found absorption spectral line features,\nwhich they identify as signatures of Fe XXVI (25-time ionized hydrogen-like Fe) and Fe XXV\nfrom the n = 2 \u2192 3 atomic transition, and of O VIII (n = 1 \u2192 2 transition). All of these\nlines are redshifted, with a unique value of the redshift z = 0.35. Interpreting the measured\nredshift as due to the strong gravitational field at the surface of the compact star (thus\nneglecting general relativistic effects due to stellar rotation on the spectral lines (\u00d6ezel &\nPsaltis 2003) ), one obtains a relation for the stellar mass-to-radius ratio:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nM/M\u2299 = 1 \u2212\nR/Rg\u2299 ,\n(15)\n(z + 1)2\n(Rg\u2299 = 2GM\u2299 /c2 = 2.953 km) which is reported in Fig.s 6 and 7 as a dashed line labeled\nz = 0.35. Comparing with the theoretical MR relations for differente EOS (see e.g. Fig. 6,,\nand also Xu 2003) it is clear that all three possible families of compact stars discussed in the\npresent paper are completely consistent with a redshitf z = 0.35.\nThe second source for which it has been claimed the detection of redshifted spectral lines\nis 1E 1207.4-5209, a radio-quite compact star located in the center of the supernova remnant\nPSK 1209-51/52. 1E 1207.4-5209 has been observed by the Chandra X-ray observatory. Two\nabsorption features have been detected in the source spectrum and have been interpreted\n(Sanwal et al. 2002) as spectral lines associated with atomic transitions of once-ionized\nhelium in the atmosphere of a strong magnetized (B \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1014 G) compact star. This\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ninterpretation gives for the gravitational redshift at the star surface z = 0.12 \u2013 0.23 (Sanwal\net al. 2002), which is reported in Fig.s 6 and 7 by the two dashed lines labeled z = 0.12 and\nz = 0.23.\nA different interpretation of similar data, collected by the XMM-Newton satellite, has\nbeen recently given by Bignami et al. (2003), who interpreted the absorption features in the\nspectrum of 1E 1207.4-5209 as electron cyclotron lines in the stellar magnetic field. Within\nthis interpretation and assuming the gravitational redshift of a \"canonical neutron star\"\nwith M = 1.4M\u2299 and R = 10 km Bignami et al. (2003) derived a magnetic field strength\nB = 8 \u00d7 1010 G for the compact star in 1E 1207.4-5209 .\nThe two values of the stellar magnetic field inferred in the above quoted papers (Sanwal\net al. 2002; Bignami et al. 2003) are in disagreement to each other and in disagreement\nwith the B field deduced from the 1E 1207.4-5209 timing parameters (P and \u1e56 ), which\ngive B = (2 \u2013 3) \u00d71012 G within the rotating magnetic dipole model. However, the latter\nvalue of the magnetic field strenght presents serious problems since the current values of the\ntiming parameters implies a characteristic pulsar age \u03c4c = P/(2\u1e56 ) \u223c 4.8 \u00d7 105 yr (Bignami\net al. 2003) which is not compatible with the age \u03c4SN R = (3\u201320) \u00d7 103 yr (Roger et al.\n1988). Clearly this source needs a more accurate study before any final and unambiguous\ninterpretations of the observed spectral features can be drawn. Here, we will assume that\nthe interpretation of the spectral feature given by Sanwal et al. (2002) and by Cottam et\nal. (2002) is correct. In that case, how it is possible to reconcile the gravitational redshift\nz =012\u20130.23 for 1E 1207.4-5209 with that (z = 0.35) deduced for EXO 0748-676? Within\nthe commonly accepted view, in which there exist in nature only one family of compact stars\n(the \"neutron stars\"), different values of the gravitational redshift could be a consequence\nof a different mass of the two stars. In our scenario, we can give a different interepretation:\n1E 1207.4-5209 is a pure hadronic star whereas EXO 0748-676 is an hybrid star or a strange\nstar. This is illustrated in Fig.s 6 and 7 by comparing our calculated MR relations with the\nredshifts deduced for the two compact X-ray sources.\n\n5.\n\nQuark Deconfinement Nova and GRBs\n\nA large variety of observational data are giving a mounting evidence that \"long-duration\"\nGamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with supernova explosions (Bloom et al. 1999;\nAmati et al. 2000; Antonelli et al. 2000; Piro et al. 2000, Reeves et al. 2002; Hjorth et al.\n2003; Price et al. 2003; Stanek et al. 2003; Lipkin et al. 2003). Particularly, in the case\nof the gamma ray burst of July 5, 1999 (GRB990705), in the case of GRB020813 and of\nGRB011211, it has been possible to estimate the time delay between the two events.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nFor GRB990705 Amati et al. (2000) evaluated that the supernova explosion (SNE)\nhas occurred about 10 years before the GRB, while Lazzati et al. (2001), giving a different\ninterpretation of the same observational data, deduced a time delay of about one year. In\nthe case of GRB020813 the supernova event has been estimated (Butler et al. 2003) to have\noccurred a few months before the GRB, while in the case of GRB011211 about four days\nbefore the burst (Reeves et al. 2002). If a time-delay between a SNE and the associated\nGRB will be confirmed by further and more accurate observations, thus it is necessary\nto have a two-step process. The first of these process is the supernova explosion which\nforms a compact stellar remnant, i.e. a neutron star. The second catastrophic event is\nassociated with the neutron star and it is the energy source for the observed GRB. These\nnew observational data, and the two-step scenario outlined above, poses severe problems for\nmost of the current theoretical models for the central energy source (the so called \"central\nengine\") of GRBs.\nIn a recent paper Berezhiani et al. (2003) have given a simple and natural interpretation of the \"delayed\" Supernova-GRB connection in terms of the stellar conversion model\n(hereafter the Quark Deconfinement Nova (QDN)) discussed in the present work. Here, with\nrespect to the work of Berezhiani et al. (2003), we have considered two different parameterizations (GM1 and GM3) for the EOS of the hadronic phase, and we have explored a\nlarger range for the bag constant in the EOS for the quark phase. Moreover, in the present\npaper the nucleation time has been calculated by considering the quantum tunneling of a\nvirtual drop of quark matter in the so called Q*-phase (see sect. 2), contrary to the work of\nBerezhiani et al. (2003) where quark flavor conservation during the deconfinement transition\nhas been neglected. We have verified that flavor conservation in computing the nucleation\ntime produces sizable differences in the value of the critical mass Mcr and on the energy\nreleased during the QDN which powers the GRB.\nAs we can see from the results reported in Tab.s 1 and 2, the total energy (Econv )\nliberated during the stellar conversion process is in the range 0.5\u20131.7\u00d71053 erg. This huge\namount of energy will be mainly carried out by the neutrinos produced during the stellar\nconversion process. It has been pointed out by Salmonson & Wilson (1999) that near the\nsurface of a compact stellar object, due to general relativity effects, the efficiency of the\nneutrino-antineutrino annihilation into e+ e\u2212 pairs is strongly enhanced with respect to the\nNewtonian case, and it could be as high as 10%. The total energy deposited into the electronphoton plasma can therefore be of the order of 1051 \u20131052 erg.\nThe strong magnetic field of the compact star will affect the motion of the electrons and\npositrons, and in turn could generate an anisotropic \u03b3-ray emission along the stellar magnetic\naxis. This picture is strongly supported by the analysis of the early optical afterglow for\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nGRB990123 and GRB021211 (Zhang et al. 2003), and by the recent discovery of an ultrarelativistic outflow from a \"neutron star\" in a binary stellar system (Fender et al. 2004).\nMoreover, it has been recently shown (Lugones et al. 2002) that the stellar magnetic field\ncould influence the velocity of the \"burning front\" of hadronic matter into quark matter.\nThis results in a strong geometrical asymmetry of the forming quark matter core along the\ndirection of the stellar magnetic axis, thus providing a suitable mechanism to produce a\ncollimated GRB (Lugones et al. 2002). Other anisotropies in the GRB could be generated\nby the rotation of the star.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the present work, we have investigated the consequences of the hadron-quark deconfinement phase transition in stellar compact objects when finite size effects between the\ndeconfined quark phase and the hadronic phase are taken into account. We have found that\nabove a threshold value of the gravitational mass a pure hadronic star is metastable to the\ndecay (conversion) to a hybrid neutron star or to a strange star 1 . We have calculated the\nmean-life time of these metastable stellar configurations, the critical mass for the hadronic\nstar sequence, and have explored how these quantities depend on the details of the EOS for\ndense matter. We have introduced an extension of the concept of limiting mass of compact\nstars, with respect to the classical one given by Oppenheimer & Volkov (1939). We have\ndemonstrated that, within the astrophysical scenario proposed in the present work, the existence of compact stars with \"small\" radii (quark stars) does not exclude the existence of\ncompact stars with \"large\" radii (pure hadronic stars), and vice versa.\nFinally, we have shown that our scenario implies, as a natural consequence a two stepprocess which is able to explain the inferred \"delayed\" connection between supernova explosions and GRBs, giving also the correct energy to power GRBs.\nThere are various specific features and predictions of the present model, which we briefly\nmention in the following. The second explosion (Quark Deconfinement Nova) take place in a\n\"baryon-clean\" enviroment due to the previous SN explosion. Is is possible to have different\ntime delays between the two events since the mean-life time of the metastable hadronic star\n1\n\nThe particular type of quark star (it i.e. hybrid star or strange star) formed at the end of the stellar\nconversion, will depend on the details of the quark matter EOS (see sect. 3). Here we want to stress that our\nscenario does not require as a necessary condition the fulfilment of the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis on the\nabsolute stability of strange matter and, thus the existence of strange stars. The delayed stellar conversion\nprocess described in this paper takes place also in the case a more \"traditional\" hybrid star is formed.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\ndepends on the value of the stellar central pressure. Thus the present model is able to\ninterpret a time delay of a few years (as observed in GRB990705 (Amati et al. 2000; Lazzati\net al. 2001)), of a few months (as in the case of GRB020813 (Butler et al. 2003)), of a few\ndays (as deduced for GRB011211 (Reeves et al. 2002)), or the nearly simultaneity of the\ntwo events (as in the case of SN2003dh and GRB030329 (Hjorth et al. 2003)).\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating discussions with David Blaschke, Alessandro\nDrago, Bennett Link, German Lugones, and Sergei B.
