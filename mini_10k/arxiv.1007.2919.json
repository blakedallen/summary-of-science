They also have been considered as potential dark\nmatter candidates [4]. In this note we point out that primordial black holes could be much\nshorter lived than usually assumed if there is a large hidden sector of particles that only\ninteract gravitationally with the particles of the standard model. There are two important\nphysical quantities which can affect the lifetime of black holes, given a large hidden sector.\nThe mass spectrum of the particles in the large hidden sector and the temperature of the\nlarge hidden sector determine if black holes can decay in that sector via Hawking radiation.\nA much shorter lifetime is expected if some of the masses of the hidden sector particles are\nsmaller than the temperature of the black hole when it is created and if the temperature of\nthe hidden sector is below that of the black hole.\nIt is now well accepted that a black hole can decay through the emission of Hawking\nradiation [5]. The time it takes for a black hole to decay is given in the standard model of\nparticle physics by (see e.g. [6])\nt=\n\n3\n5120\u03c0G2 MBH\n~c4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G is Newton's constant and MBH is the black hole mass. As we shall see shortly,\nthe lifetime of a black hole can be affected if the available phase-space is larger than in\nthe standard model. A black hole of one solar mass (i.e MBH \u2248 2 \u00d7 1030 kg will decay\nin 2.1 \u00d7 1067 years, which is much larger than the age of the universe (13.7 \u00d7 109 years).\nHowever, a black hole today can only evaporate if its temperature is above the temperature\nof the cosmic microwave background today i.e. 2.7 K. The temperature of a black hole is\nrelated to its mass by\nTH =\n\n~c3\n.\n8\u03c0GMBH kB\n\n(2)\n\nThis implies that only black holes with masses less than 0.8% of the earth mass can decay\ntoday. A black hole of 1011 kg would evaporate in 2.7 billion years. Exploding primordial\nblack holes could thus be discovered. However, if there is a large hidden sector of particles\nin nature that only interacts gravitationally with those of standard model, black holes could\nevaporate much faster. If the phase-space for the black hole to decay is increased by a factor\nN, where N stands for the number of new particles, one has approximatively\nt\u2248\n\n3\n5120\u03c0G2MBH\n1\n.\n~c4\nN\n\n(3)\n\nIf N is large, i.e., if there are some 109 and some of the masses of the particles of the\nhidden sector are below the temperature of the black hole, primordial black holes would\nhave decayed a long time ago and an observation of a primordial black hole exploding today\n1\n\n\fwould imply a tight bound on the number of fields in a hidden sector. Note that as the black\nhole decays the phase-space will open up to more massive particles in the hidden sector as\nthe temperature of the black hole will increase as its mass decreases.\nThis is of particular interest for models of particles physics which are addressing the\ngauge hierarchy problem by introducing a large number of fields. This mechanism effectively\nreduces the energy scale of quantum gravity to 1 TeV, see [7] for a review. This requires\nsome 1033 new fields with masses below 1 TeV. Note that the large hidden sector does not\nnecessarily need to be in thermal equilibrium with the visible universe since its particles\nonly interact gravitationally with the standard model fields and its temperature could be\nlower or higher than the CMB temperature. In any case, if there is a large hidden sector,\nprimordial black holes will decay invisibly from the standard model point of view. If the\ntemperature of the hidden sector is closer to absolute zero, more massive black holes could\ndecay via Hawking radiation in that sector, assuming that the mass spectrum of the hidden\nsector allows it.\nAn observation of an exploding primordial black hole today would allow us to constrain\nthe scale at which quantum gravity becomes strong which is defined by M\u0304 (\u03bc\u22c6 ) \u223c \u03bc\u22c6 where\nM\u0304(\u03bc\u22c6 ) is the running reduced Planck mass given by [8, 9]\nM\u0304 (\u03bc)2 = M\u0304 (0)2 \u2212\n\n\u03bc2\nNl\n96\u03c0 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we set ~ = c = 1, M\u0304 (0) is the reduced Planck mass measured over astrophysical\ndistances and Nl = NS + NF \u2212 4NV with NS , NF and NV respectively the number of real\nscalars, Weyl fermions and vector bosons in the theory. The true energy scale \u03bc\u2217 at which\nquantum gravity effects are large is one at which\nM\u0304P2 (\u03bc\u2217 ) \u223c \u03bc2\u2217 .\n\n(5)\n\nThis condition implies that fluctuations in spacetime geometry at length scales \u03bc\u22121\n\u2217 will be\nunsuppressed. One finds [8\u201310]:\n\u03bc\u22c6 = q\n\nM\u0304 (0)\n1+\n\nNl\n96\u03c0 2\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThis shows that the energy scale at which quantum gravitational effects become large, i.e.\nthe Planck scale, can be much lower than naively assumed. In an extreme case, the Planck\nscale physics could be relevant for the LHC. As in models with large extra-dimensions,\nthe Planck mass could be in the TeV region. If there is a large hidden sector consisting\nof 1033 particles of spin 0 and/or 1/2 which are only interacting gravitationally with the\nstandard model, the scale of quantum gravity is at 1 TeV and quantum black holes [11]\n2\n\n\for gravitons [12] could be produced at the LHC. Newton's potential has been probed up to\ndistances of (10\u22123 eV)\u22121 , the masses of the bulk of the particles of the hidden sector should be\nlarger than 10\u22123 eV otherwise the running of Newton's constant would have been observed\nin e.g. the E\u00f6t-Wash short-range experiment. Note that cosmic ray experiments set a bound\non the four-dimensional Planck mass of the order of 500 GeV [13] since small black holes\ncould form in the collision of cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere.\nThe temperature of a 0.8% earth mass black hole is 0.1 GeV. If a decaying primordial\nblack hole was observed, we would conclude that Nl \u223c N < 109 with at least some of the\nmasses below \u223c 0.05 GeV and thus \u03bc\u22c6 > 2.4 \u00d7 1015 GeV. We provide some more numerical\nexamples in Table 1. The mass of a primordial black hole in kg created in the early universe\nand decaying today as a function of the number of fields N in the hidden sector is shown\nin Figure 1. Note that the case of N \u223c 1033 particles of masses below 10\u221220 GeV is ruled\nout by probes of Newton's 1/r potential in the solar system. As the black hole decays, its\ntemperature will increase thus opening decay channels into heavier particles. The extreme\ncase would be that of a quantum black hole with a mass of the order of \u03bc\u22c6 which could\ndecay into two particles of masses \u03bc\u22c6 /2. It is thus not strictly speaking necessary that all\nparticles of the hidden sector are lighter than the original temperature of the black hole as\nlong as some of them are in order to allow the temperature to increase. Generically speaking,\nblack holes which are cooler than the CMB will evaporate into the hidden sector if the mass\nspectrum of the hidden sector particles allows for it.\n\nreduced Plank mass\nBH mass in kg\nTemperature in GeV\nlifetime in 109 yr, N = 0\nlifetime in 109 yr, N = 109\nlifetime in 109 yr, N = 5 \u00d7 1033\n\n6\n\n5 \u00d7 10\n2 \u00d7 103\n10\u221213\n10\u221222\n10\u221247\n\n11\n\n10\n0.1\n2.7\n10\u22129\n10\u221234\n\n30\n\n10\n10\u221220\n1057\n1048\n1023\n\n2.43 \u00d7 1018 GeV\n2.4 \u00d7 1015 GeV\n1000 GeV\n\nTable 1: N is the number of particles with masses below the final black hole temperature.\nClearly an observation of an exploding primordial black hole of mass \u223c 1011 kg would\nrule out a hidden sector of more than 109 particles with a mass spectrum starting below\n0.05 GeV. As the black hole decays, more massive particles would become accessible. We\nwould conclude that the Planck mass has to be larger than 2.4 \u00d7 1015 GeV. Note, however,\nthat it is possible to build a model with 109 particles and masses above 0.1 GeV or with a\ntemperature of the hidden sector higher than the CMB temperature in which case the lifetime\nof primordial black holes would be less drastically affected as the hidden sector particles only\nbecome relevant when the black hole mass has already sufficiently decreased.

This represents yet another strong motivation to search for\ndecaying primordial black holes.\nFinally let us conclude by pointing out that if the temperature of the hidden sector\nis very close to absolute zero, any black hole can decay today into the hidden sector via\nHawking radiation assuming that some of the particles in the hidden sector are light enough.\nThe lifetime of astrophysical black holes could be sizably affected by a large hidden sector.\nSimilar observations have been made in the framework of extra-dimensional models [14]\nwhich effectively also contain a large number of fields.\nAcknowledgments: It is my pleasure to acknowledge discussions with Stephen Hsu and\nClaus Kiefer.
