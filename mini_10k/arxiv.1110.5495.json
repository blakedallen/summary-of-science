First pointed out by Grinstein,4 the property\nwas shown to emerge from perturbation expansion to all\norders by Aharony et al.3 and Young.5 Finally, Parisi and\nSourlas, in a beautiful 2-page letter,6 related the critical\nbehavior of the RFIM to a supersymmetric scalar field\ntheory and showed that the supersymmetry leads to dimensional reduction. Phenomenological,1,7 numerical,2\nand rigorous studies8,9 have however established that the\ndimensional-reduction prediction is wrong, at least in low\ndimensions (d \u2264 3). It has also been understood that the\nsuperfield construction of Ref. [6] loses its validity when\nmultiple metastable states are present, which is the case\nin the region of interest.10 In addition, it has been shown\nthat dimensional reduction follows from supersymmetry\nnot only in perturbative expansions as in Ref. [6] but in\na nonperturbative manner.11\u201313\nDespite the elegance of the formalism, no steps beyond\nthe original superfield formulation have so far proven\nuseful,14 and the goal of the present work is to provide\na solution by combining superfield formalism and functional renormalization group (FRG). This is part of our\nongoing program16\u201319 to build a consistent and comprehensive theory of the long-distance physics of random\nfield models, and more generally of disordered systems,\nbased on the nonperturbative functional renormalization\ngroup (NP-FRG). In papers I18 and II19 of this series,\nwe showed that the breakdown of dimensional reduction\nis related to the appearance of a nonanalytic dependence\nof the effective action (or Gibbs free-energy functional\nin the terminology of magnetic systems) in the dimensionless fields. However, our approach, which was based\non a \"replica method\" for handling the average over the\n\nrandom field, could not address the pending question of\nsupersymmetry and its breaking. (In consequence, there\nwas no means to avoid explicit breaking of the supersymmetry in the regulators and in the approximation\nscheme.) As the effective Hamiltonian (or bare action)\nof the model in the presence of a random field has always\nmultiple minima in the region of interest (near the critical point), it would seem that a superfield approach and\nthe dimensional-reduction predictions can never be valid.\nOur objective is nonetheless to give a meaning to the superfield formalism even in cases where multiple minima\nare present and/or supersymmetry is broken, and to investigate the validity of the dimensional-reduction results\nas one varies spatial dimension. As will be shown, a resolution of the problem requires an FRG formulation.\nOur starting point is that the fundamental flaw of the\nParisi-Sourlas supersymmetric construction6 has in fact\na two-fold origin:\n(1) the presence of metastable states, which can be\ndescribed at zero temperature as the multiplicity of solutions of the stochastic field equation associated with\nthe extremization of the bare action of the RFIM, is not\ncounterbalanced by a means to select the ground state\nand\n(2) the use of a single copy of the original disordered\nsystem does not give access to the full functional dependence of the cumulants of the renormalized disorder and\nis thereby unable to account for the rare events, such as\navalanches and droplets, that characterize random-field\nsystems.\nThe second aspect has already been addressed in our\nprevious investigation through the NP-FRG and it requires introducing copies or replicas of the original system with the same disorder but different applied sources\n(resulting in an explicit breaking of the permutational\nsymmetry between replicas). We will show in the companion paper that the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry (more precisely of \"superrotational invariance\")\nthat comes with the breakdown of dimensional reduction is precisely linked to the emergence of a strong\n\n\f2\nenough nonanalytic dependence of the cumulants of the\nrenormalized disorder. Curing the first problem on the\nother hand implies a way to properly select the ground\nstate among all solutions of the stochastic field equation. We propose a resolution of this problem through\nthe introduction of a weighting factor and the construction of a superfield theory in a curved superspace. In\nthe present paper, we relate ground-state dominance to\na formal property that we call \"Grassmannian ultralocality\". This finding may have value for other problems in\nwhich a generating functional is built from the solutions\nof a stochastic field equation, as in other disordered or\nglassy systems,20 in turbulence21 or in nonabelian gauge\nfield theories.22\u201324\nThe outline of the article is as follows. In Sec. II\nwe introduce the superfield formalism for the T = 0\nequilibrium long-distance properties of the RFIM, as\nproposed by Parisi and Sourlas,6 and we discuss the\nsymmetries, supersymmetries and the associated WardTakahashi identities.\nIn Sec. III we discuss the property of \"Grassmannian\nultralocality\" and its connection to the fact that a unique\nsolution of the stochastic field equation is taken into account in the computation of the generating functionals;\nwe next formulate a procedure to properly select the\nground state, which is relevant for the T = 0 equilibrium long-distance properties of the RFIM, through the\ninsertion of a weighting factor and the consideration of a\ncurved superspace.\nWe show in Sec. IV that a complete description of\nthe renormalized random functional that describes the\nphysics of the RFIM, including rare events such as\navalanches and droplets, requires introducing copies of\nthe original system with independently controlled sources\nso that the hierarchy of cumulants with their full functional dependence can be generated. We then consider\nthe properties of the superfield theory with multiple\ncopies, its (super)symmetries and the associated WardTakahashi identites.\nIn the following section, Sec. V, we explore the formal\nconsequences of the property of \"Grassmannian ultralocality\".\nWe next describe in Sec. VI the generalization to superfields in a curved superspace of our previously developed\nNP-FRG approach in the effective action formalism. We\ncarefully discuss the issue of the infrared regulator and we\nderive the exact FRG equations for the cumulants of the\nrenormalized disorder; we also consider the implication\nfor these equations of the hypothesis of \"Grassmannian\nultralocality\".\nIn Sec. VII, we detail how our formalism allows one to\ndescribe ground-state dominance at long distance in the\nNP-FRG. We show that the limit of infinite curvature,\nwhich corresponds to a vanishing auxiliary temperature,\ngives back the FRG equations for the cumulants of the\nrenormalized disorder under the property of \"Grassmannian ultralocality\".\nWe finally conclude with a summary and a discussion.\n\nAdditional information is provided in several appendices.\nIn the companion paper, we apply the NP-FRG in\nthe superfield formalism to describe supersymmetry and\nits spontaneous breaking in the critical behavior of the\nRFIM. We introduce a nonperturbative approximation\nscheme to the exact FRG equations for the cumulants\nand solve the flow equations numerically to determine\nthe critical exponents and the fixed-point properties as\na function of space dimension d. This provides a resolution of the long-standing puzzles associated with the\nlong-distance physics of the RFIM.\nA short account of this work has appeared in Ref.[25].\nII.\n\nTHE PARISI-SOURLAS SUPERFIELD\nFORMALISM FOR THE RFIM\nA.\n\nModel and generating functionals\n\nThe starting point is the field-theoretical description\nof the RFIM in terms of a scalar field \u03c6(x) in a ddimensional space and a bare action S[\u03c6; h] given by\n\u001b\nZ \u001a\n1\n2\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x)) + UB (\u03c6(x)) \u2212 h(x)\u03c6(x) , (1)\nS=\n2\nx\nR d\nR\nwhere x \u2261 d x, UB (\u03c6) = (\u03c4 /2)\u03c62 +(u/4!)\u03c64 , and h(x)\nis a random source (a random magnetic field in the language of magnetic systems) that is taken with a Gaussian\ndistribution characterized by a zero mean and a variance\nh(x)h(y) = \u2206B \u03b4 (d) (x \u2212 y). A (ultra-violet) momentum\ncutoff \u039b, associated with an inverse microscopic lengthscale such as a lattice spacing, is also implicitly considered.\nThe Parisi-Sourlas construction goes as follows.6 Taking advantage of the fact that at long-distance the thermal fluctuations are negligible compared to those induced\nby disorder (formally, the critical behavior is controlled\nby a zero-temperature fixed point2,26,27 ), one can focus\non the ground-state configuration which is solution of the\nstochastic field equation\n\u03b4S[\u03c6; h]\n= J(x),\n\u03b4\u03c6(x)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we have added an external source (a magnetic\nfield) J conjugate to the \u03c6 field.\nProvided the solution of Eq. (2) is unique, the equilibrium (Green's) correlation functions of the \u03c6 field are\nobtained from appropriate derivatives of the generating\nfunctional\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n2\n\u02c6 J] = D\u03c6 \u03b4 \u03b4SB [\u03c6] \u2212 h \u2212 J det \u03b4 SB [\u03c6]\nZh [J,\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\nZ\n\u02c6\n\u00d7 exp J(x)\u03c6(x),\nx\n\n(3)\nwhere SB [\u03c6] = x {(1/2)(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x))2 +UB (\u03c6(x))}; the delta\nfunctional \u03b4[ ] enforces that \u03c6 is solution of Eq. (2)\nR\n\n\f3\nand the absolute value of the functional determinant of\n\u03b4 2 SB [\u03c6]/(\u03b4\u03c6(x)\u03b4\u03c6(y)) is the associated jacobian. Due to\nthe postulated uniqueness of the solution, the absolute\nvalue can be dropped and the functional can be built\nthrough standard field-theoretical techniques.24 One first\nintroduces auxiliary fields: a bosonic \"response\" field\n\u03c6\u0302(x) associated with the integral representation of the\ndelta functional and two fermionic \"ghost\" fields \u03c8(x)\nand \u03c8\u0304(x) [satisfying \u03c8 2 = \u03c8\u0304 2 = \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304+\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 = 0] to exponentiate the determinant.

(2).\nThe next step of the construction is to introduce a superspace by adding to the d-dimensional Euclidean space\n\nwith coordinates x = {x\u03bc } two anti-commuting Grassmann coordinates \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304 (satisfying \u03b82 = \u03b8\u03042 = \u03b8\u03b8\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304\u03b8 =\n0).24 By letting x = (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) denote the coordinates, the\nassociated (super)metric is given by\ndx2 = dx2 +\n\n4\nd\u03b8\u0304d\u03b8 = gmn dxm dxn ,\n\u2206B\n\n(8)\n\nwhere {m} \u2261 {\u03bc, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304}, dx2 = dx\u03bc dx\u03bc , and a summation over repeated indices is implied; the metric tensor\ngmn satisfies: g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd , g\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = \u2212g\u03b8\u0304\u03b8 = \u22122/\u2206B , with\nall other components equal to zero. With the notations\n\u2202m = \u2202/\u2202xm , \u2202\u03bc = \u2202/\u2202x\u03bc , \u2202\u03b8 = \u2202/\u2202\u03b8, etc..., one can\nexpress the corresponding \"super-Laplacian\" as\n\u2206ss = g mn \u2202m \u2202n = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + \u2206B \u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\u0304 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere g mp gpn = \u03b4nm . After introducing the superfield\n\u03a6(x) = \u03c6(x) + \u03b8\u0304\u03c8(x) + \u03c8\u0304(x)\u03b8 + \u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u03c6\u0302(x)\n\n(10)\n\nand the supersource\n\u02c6\nJ (x) = J(x) + \u03b8\u0304K(x) + K\u0304(x)\u03b8 + \u03b8\u0304\u03b8J(x),\nthe generating functional can be cast in the form6\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\nZ[J ] = D\u03a6 exp \u2212Sss [\u03a6] + J (x)\u03a6(x)\nx\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n= exp(W [J ])\n\nwith\n\nZ\n\n1\n[\u2212 \u03a6(x)\u2206ss \u03a6(x) + UB (\u03a6(x))],\n(13)\n2\nx\nR RR\nR\nd\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304. By a Legendre transform, one\nand with x \u2261 x\nintroduces the effective action \u0393[\u03a6] which is the generating functional of the 1-particle irreducible (1PI) correlation functions or proper vertices:24\nZ\n\u0393[\u03a6] = \u2212W [J ] + J (x)\u03a6(x),\n(14)\nSss [\u03a6] =\n\nx\n\nwhere the (classical) superfield \u03a6 and the supersource J\nare related through\n\u03a6(x) =\n\n\u03b4W [J ]\n\u03b4J (x)\n\n(15)\n\nJ (x) =\n\n\u03b4\u0393[\u03a6]\n,\n\u03b4\u03a6(x)\n\n(16)\n\nand\n\nwhich can also easily be expressed in terms of the components of the classical superfield, \u03c6, \u03c6\u0302, \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304, and of the\n\u02c6 J, K\u0304, K. (Note that for simplicity we keep\nsupersource, J,\nthe same notation for the superfield \u03a6 and its classical\nvalue, and similarly for the ghost fields \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304; we only\nmake a distinction for the bosonic fields, i.e. \u03c6 = h\u03c6i\nand \u03c6\u0302 = h\u03c6\u0302i.)\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nSymmetries, supersymmetries, and\nWard-Takahashi identities\n\nThe action Sss [\u03a6] is invariant under a large group of\ntransformations:\n(i) sign changes associated with a Z2 discrete symmetry \u03a6 \u2192 \u2212\u03a6 (the critical behavior we aim at describing\nis associated with a spontaneous breaking of this Z2 symmetry, i.e. a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition in\nthe language of magnetism);\n(ii) rotations and translations in the d-dimensional Euclidean space with infinitesimal generators L\u03bc\u03bd = x\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2212\nx\u03bd \u2202\u03bc and \u2202\u03bc , where \u03bc, \u03bd = 1, ..., d, respectively;\n(iii) transformations of the symplectic group with generators acting on the Grassmann subspace: t\u0304 = \u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03b8 ,\nt = \u03b8\u2202\u03b8\u0304 (associated with \"rotations\" in the 2-dimensional\nGrassmann subspace) and N = \u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8\u2202\u03b8 (corresponding to the \"ghost-number conservation\"); the generators\nsatisfy the commutation relations [t\u0304, t] = N , [N, t\u0304] = 2t\u0304,\nand [N, t] = \u22122t;\n(iv) translations in the 2-dimensional Grassmann subspace with generators \u2202\u03b8 , \u2202\u03b8\u0304 : these are linear, BRS-type,\nsymmetries;24\n(v) \"superrotations\" that preserve the supermetric and\ncan be represented by the generators Q\u0304\u03bc = \u2212x\u03bc \u2202\u03b8 +\n2\n2\n\u03bc\n\u2206B \u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03bc and Q\u03bc = x \u2202\u03b8\u0304 + \u2206B \u03b8\u2202\u03bc .\nThe last two sets of transformations mix bosonic and\nfermionic fields and for this reason represent \"fermionic\nsymmetries\".24 They are associated with supersymmetries: the translations in the 2-dimensional Grassmann\nsubspace (iv) form a supergroup and the Euclidean rotations (ii), the symplectic group (iii) and the superrotations (v) form another supergroup known as the orthosymplectic supergroup OSp(2, d).28\nThe linearly realized continuous symmetries and supersymmetries (ii)-(v) lead to a set of Ward-Takahashi\n(WT) identities that can be expressed either at the level\nof the generating functional of the Green's functions or\nthat of the effective action.24 For instance, the invariance\nof the action under the superrotations gives rise to the\nfollowing WT identities:\nZ\n\u03a6(x)Qx \u0393(1)\n(17)\nx [\u03a6] = 0\nx\n\nand for p > 1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQx1 + ... + Qxp \u0393(p)\nx1 ...xp [\u03a6]\nZ\n\u03a6(xp+1 )Qxp+1 \u0393(p+1)\n+\nx1 ...xp+1 [\u03a6] = 0,\nxp+1\n\n(18)\nwhere we have used the notation Qx to indicate a generic\ncomponent Q\u03bc of the generator of the superrotation acting on the superspace coordinate x; the proper (1PI) vertices are defined as\n\u0393x(p)\n[\u03a6] =\n1 ,...,xp\n\n\u03b4 p \u0393[\u03a6]\n.\n\u03b4\u03a6(x1 )...\u03b4\u03a6(xp )\n\n(19)\n\nSimilar identites are obtained with the generator Q\u0304x (and\nadditional ones with the generators \u2202\u03bc , L\u03bc\u03bd , \u2202\u03b8 , \u2202\u03b8\u0304 , t\u0304, t,\nand N ).\nAt this point, it is important to stress that it is the\nexistence of the superrotation invariance (v) which leads\nto the property of dimensional reduction in the critical\nbehavior of the RFIM, with the two Grassmann dimensions acting as negative dimensions.6,11 One should however keep in mind that the whole formal construction\ncollapses when the stochastic field equation, Eq. (2), has\nmore than one solution, which is usually the case in the\nregion of interest.10 In the following, we show how to\ngeneralize the Parisi-Sourlas construction in order to preserve the relevance of the superfield formalism.\n\nIII.\n\n\"GRASSMANNIAN ULTRALOCALITY\"\nAND GROUND-STATE DOMINANCE\n\nA. On the \"ultralocality\" of the random\ngenerating functional in the Grassmann subspace\n\nBefore presenting the method to select the groundstate configuration, which should dominate at T = 0,\nwe discuss an important property of the random generating functional in the superfield framework. To alleviate\nthe notations we consider the case of a d = 0 Euclidean\nspace, but the same considerations equally apply to any\nnumber of Euclidean dimensions. When the stochastic\nfield equation [Eq. (2)], which can be rewritten as\n\u2202SB (\u03c6)\n=h+J,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(20)\n\nhas a unique solution, say \u03c6\u2217 (h+J), the generating functional of the (Green's) correlation functions of the \u03c6 field\nis simply expressed as\n\u02c6\nZh (J\u02c6, J) = eJ\u03c6\u2217 (h+J) ,\n\n(21)\n\nor, after adding the fermionic sources K, K\u0304 and using the\nauxiliary fields [see Eq. (4)], as\n(2)\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u02c6 J, K\u0304, K) \u2261 Zh [J ] = eJ\u03c6\u2217 (h+J)\u2212K\u0304KSB\nZh (J,\n\n(\u03c6\u2217 (h+J))\u22121\n\n(22)\nwhere\nis the second derivative of the bare action\nand J is the supersource introduced in Eq. (11). As a\nconsequence, the (random) generating functional Wh =\nlog Zh is equal to\n(2)\nSB (\u03c6)\n\n(2)\n\nWh [J ] = J\u02c6 \u03c6\u2217 (h + J) \u2212 K\u0304K SB (\u03c6\u2217 (h + J))\u22121 . (23)\nIt is straighforward to show that this precisely corresponds to an \"ultralocal\" form in the Grassmann\nsubspace,29\nZ\nWh [J ] = Wh (J (\u03b8))\n(24)\n\u03b8\n\n\f5\nwhere\nthe two Grassmann coordinates \u03b8\u0304 and \u03b8\nRR\nR \u03b8 collects\nand \u03b8 \u2261\nd\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304; indeed,\nZ\n\n\u03b8\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nWh (J (\u03b8)) = J\u02c6 Wh (J) \u2212 K\u0304K Wh (J)\n\n(1)\n\n(25)\n\n(2)\n\nwith Wh (J) = \u03c6\u2217 (h + J) and Wh (J) = \u2202\u03c6\u2217 (h +\n(2)\nJ)/\u2202J = SB (\u03c6\u2217 (h + J))\u22121 as it should be. The whole\nformal construction is fully justified in this case.\nWhat happens when the stochastic field equation has\nseveral solutions ? Let us sort the solutions and label\nthem with an index \u03b1; \u03b1 = 0 denotes the ground state,\nwhich is unique for a continuous distribution of the random field, aside from exceptional values of h+J for which\na coexistence of several ground states may take place.\nThe sought-for generating functional that describes\nthe equilibrium situation at T = 0 only takes into account the contribution of the ground state. As a result, one has exactly the same relations as above, with\n\u03c6\u2217 (h+J) replaced by the ground-state solution \u03c60 (h+J).\nActually, the notation \u03c60 (h + J) is a little misleading\nas the ground state is generally a piecewise function\nof h + J with discontinuities occuring at special values of the latter. These discontinuities are known as\n\"avalanches\" (or \"shocks\") and have been observed for\ninstance in numerical computations of the ground state\nof the RFIM on 2- and 3-dimensional lattices.30\u201333 The\nground-state\nsolution \u03c60 (h + J) should rather be written\nP\nas i C0,i (h+ J)\u03c60,i (h+ J) with C0,i the characteristic of\nthe ith interval along the axis h + J in which the ground\nstate \u03c60,i is a continuous function of h + J (see also Appendix A). More generally, including a single solution in\n\u02c6 J, K\u0304, K), provided this\nthe generating functional Zh (J,\nsolution is piecewise defined for all values of h + J, also\nleads to the \"ultralocal property\" in the Grassmann subspace for Wh [J ], Eq. (24).\nOn the other hand, one easily realizes that this property cannot be true when several different solutions are\nincluded in the generating functional, no matter how one\nchooses to weigh these solutions. The weighting of the\nsolutions that corresponds to the above Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetric construction, Eq. (4), is given by the sign\n(2)\nof the determinant of the Hessian SB .34 Then, setting\nto zero the fermionic sources for simplicity, one has\nX\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 J) =\n(\u22121)n(\u03b1) C\u03b1,i (h + J)eJ\u03c6\u03b1,i (h+J) , (26)\nZh (J,\n\nP\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1 denotes i C\u03b1,i (h + J)\u03c6\u03b1,i (h + J), is not \"ultralocal\" in the Grassmann coordinates, i.e. cannot be\nput in the form of Eqs. (23-25) [observe in particular that\n\u02c6\nthe form in Eq. (23) implies a linear dependence on J,\nwhich is not satisfied by the above expression]. When\nJ\u02c6 = 0, one finds that Zh = 1 and Wh = 0, just as in\nthe case where a unique solution is taken into account.35\nHowever, the result now follows from the property that\nthe sum of all solutions weighted by the sign of the determinant of the Hessian is a topological invariant which\nis equal to 1 in the present case.36\nNote that contrary to the toy model discussed in\nRef. [34], in which the breakdown of the supersymmetric\nformalism is related to the fact that the stochastic equation has no solutions for a certain range of the random\nfield, the stochastic equation associated with the present\nscalar field theory in a Gaussian distributed random field\nhas always at least one solution (the ground state always\nexists).\nB.\n\nA natural procedure to select the ground state is to add\nin the generating functional, Eq.(3), a weighting factor\nthat strongly favors the solution with the smallest action. This can be done through a Bolzmann-like factor,\nnamely,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nZ\n\u03b4SB [\u03c6]\n\u03b4 SB [\u03c6]\n(\u03b2) \u02c6\nZh [J, J] = D\u03c6 \u03b4\n\u00d7\n\u2212 h \u2212 J det\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\u03b4\u03c6\u03b4\u03c6\n\u0012\n\u0013 Z\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u02c6\nexp \u2212 \u03b2 SB [\u03c6] \u2212 [J(x) + h(x)]\u03c6(x) + J(x)\u03c6(x)\nx\n\n\u03b1\n\nx\n\n(28)\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse of an auxiliary temperature (the\n(\u03b2)\nactual temperature is equal to zero). Note that Zh is\nnot the same as the partition function obtained from the\nequilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs measure at a temperature\nT = 1/\u03b2. Even if \u03b2 is large enough that only minima\ncontribute to Eq. (28), the latter expression only includes\nthe contribution of the minima whereas the BoltzmannGibbs measure also takes into account the contribution of\nthe basins of attraction of the minima (roughly speaking,\nthe thermal fluctuations around the minima).\nWith the above generating functional, one finds that\nthe average of the field \u03c6 is given by\n\n\u03b1,i\n\nwhere n(\u03b1) is the index of the \u03b1th solution, i.e. the\nassociated number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian\n(2)\nSB , and C\u03b1,i (h + J) is the characteristic function of the\nith interval over which \u03c6\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1,i is a continuous function\nof h + J [at the boundaries of C\u03b1,i (h + J) the solution\n\u03c6\u03b1 has a discontinous jump or possibly stops to exist].\nObviously,\nX\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 J) = log\nWh (J,\n(27)\n(\u22121)n(\u03b1) eJ\u03c6\u03b1 (h+J) ,\n\nSelecting the ground state\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nh\u03c6(x)i =\n\n\u03b4 log Zh\n\u02c6\n\u03b4 J(x)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n=\n\u02c6\nJ=0\n\n\u03b4Zh\n1\n(\u03b2) \u02c6\n\u02c6\nZ [J = 0, J] \u03b4 J(x)\nh\n\n.\n\u02c6\nJ=0\n\n(29)\nThe simplicity of the Parisi-Sourlas formalism is however\n(\u03b2)\nlost as Zh [J\u02c6 = 0, J] 6= 1. In consequence, simply con(\u03b2)\nsidering the average over the disorder of Zh is no longer\nsufficient to generate the \u03c6-field correlation functions of\nthe original problem.\nInterestingly, the superfield formalim can still prove\nuseful. After having introduced one bosonic and two\n\n\f6\nfermionic auxiliary fields as before, added two fermionic\nsources, grouped all the sources in a supersource as in\nEq. (11), and similarly grouped all the fields in a superfield as in Eq. (10), the generating functional can be\nrewritten as\n\u0012 Z Z\nZ\n(\u03b2)\nZh [J ] = D\u03a6 exp \u2212\nd\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304[1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8]SB [\u03a6(\u03b8)]\n\u0013\nZ Z Z\n+\nd\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304[1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8] [h(x) + J (x, \u03b8)] \u03a6(x, \u03b8)\nx\n\n=\n\n(\u03b2)\nexp(Wh [J ]).\n\n(30)\nThe construction may appear rather formal and untractable but it turns out that Eq. (30) can be expressed\nin a way which will prove efficient to study the symmetries of the theory and investigate its long-distance properties. It is convenient to introduce a superspace combining the d Euclidean and the 2 Grassmannian dimensions\nin which the Grassmann subspace is now curved. To be\nmore specific, we replace the metric tensor of the ParisiSourlas formalism (see section II-A) by\ng\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = \u2212g\u03b8\u0304\u03b8 = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8) ,\ng\u03b8\u03b8 = g\u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u0304 = 0 ,\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n\u02c6 J) =\nWh (J,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 \u03b2 SB [\u03c60 (h + J)] \u2212 (h + J)\u03c60 (h + J) + J\u02c6 \u03c60 (h + J)+\nX\n\u0001\n\u02c6\nlog 1 +\n(\u22121)n(\u03b1) e\u2212\u03b2\u2206S\u03b1,0 (h+J)+J[\u03c6\u03b1 (h+J)\u2212\u03c60 (h+J)] ,\n\u03b16=0\n\n(33)\nwhere \u2206S\u03b1,0 = (SB [\u03c6\u03b1 ] \u2212 SB [\u03c60 ]) \u2212 (h + J)(\u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c60 ).\nAssume first that the parameter \u03b2 can be taken sufficiently large for ensuring \u2206S\u03b1,0 \u226a 1/\u03b2 for all solutions\n\u03b1 6= 0, so that all contributions but that of the ground\nstate can be neglected in Eq. (33). It is then easy to show\nthat the random functional can be put in an \"ultralocal\"\nform appropriate for the curved Grassmann subspace,\nZ\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nWh [J ] = Wh [J (\u03b8)],\n(34)\n\u03b8\n\nwhere\n(\u03b2)\n\n(31)\n\nkeeping gmn = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd for the Euclidean sector and all crosscomponents between Euclidean and Grassmannian coordinates equal to zero. So long as we are not interested in\nmixing bosonic and fermionic directions (mixing occurs\nwhen considering superrotations, see section II-A), there\nis no need to introduce the factor 2/\u2206B in the supermetric as was done in the Parisi-Sourlas formalism above.\nThe properties of the curved superspace are discussed\nin Ref. [37]. In a nutshell, one has the usual prescriptions of Riemannian geometry that in order to satisfy the\nisometries of the curved Grassmann subspace, one should\n(i) contract Grassmann indices with either the metric\ntensor or its inverse, (ii) integrate\nover the Grassmann co\u221a\nordinates with a measure sdetg d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304 = (1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8) d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304,\nwhere sdetg = (1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)2 is the superdeterminant of the\nmetric tensor in the Grassmann sector, (iii) use, if necessary, covariant derivatives as well as the proper Laplacian\noperator \u2206\u03b8 = g mn (\u2202m \u2202n \u2212\u0393pmn \u2202p ), where m, n, p = \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304,\nsummation over repeated indices is implied, and the\n\u0393pmn 's are the Christoffel symbols with nonzero components \u0393\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = \u2212\u0393\u03b8\u03b8\u0304\u03b8 = \u03b2\u03b8 and \u0393\u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u03b8\u0304 = \u2212\u0393\u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u0304\u03b8 = \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304; the\nLaplacian for the Grassmann subspace is then explicitly\ngiven by\n\u2206\u03b8 = 2(1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)(\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03b8\u0304 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b8\u2202\u03b8 ).\n\nfermionic sources. The random generating functional\n(\u03b2)\nWh [J ] corresponding to the superfield construction in\nEqs. (29) and (30) is expressed as\n\n(32)\n\nIt is easy to show that the parameter \u03b2 (inverse of an\nauxiliary temperature) is up to a factor 1/6 equal to the\nRicci scalar curvature of the Grassmann subspace.37\nWe now come back to the discussion of the previous\nsubsection concerning \"ultralocality\" in the Grassmann\nsubspace. For ease of notation, we consider again a d = 0\nEuclidean subspace and we momentarily drop the two\n\nWh [J] = SB [\u03c60 (h + J)] \u2212 (h + J)\u03c60 (h + J)\n\n(35)\n\nis actually independent of \u03b2 and where the integralRover\n\u03b8 now involves the metric factor (1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8), i.e. \u03b8 \u2261\nRR\n(1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304.\nIn fact, no matter how large (but finite) \u03b2, the above\nassumption may not be valid for all realizations of the\nrandom field. Excited states with \u2206S\u03b1,0 . 1/\u03b2 may\nbe present. The vast majority of them involve only local changes of configuration with respect to the ground\n\u02c6 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c60 ) remains\nstate.38,39 As a result, the term J(\u03c6\nsmall in d Euclidean dimensions, provided J\u02c6 of course\nstays small or finite (here, we are ultimately interested\nin the limit J\u02c6 = 0). In addition, rare excitations, also\nknown as \"droplets\",40 may involve a large-scale reorganization of the ground-state configuration while satisfying \u2206S\u03b1,0 . 1/\u03b2 and therefore provide a significant\n(\u03b2)\ncontribution to Wh . In such a situation, the \"ultralocality\" in the curved Grassmann subspace is broken and\nthe random generating function has the general form\n(\u03b2)\n\nWh [J ] =\nZ\n\u03b2\n(\u03b2)\nWh [J (\u03b8), (1 + \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)\u2202\u03b8 J (\u03b8), \u2206\u03b8 J (\u03b8)],\n2\n\u03b8\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b8 is a short-hand notation for designating either\n\u2202\u03b8\u0304 or \u2202\u03b8 , and we recall that \u2206\u03b8 = 2(1+\u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)(\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\u0304 \u2212\u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03b8\u0304 \u2212\n\u03b2\u03b8\u2202\u03b8 ) is the Laplacian in the curved Grassmann subspace\n(see above). Note that the functional dependence on the\nEuclidean coordinates is completely general at this point.\nThe droplets being nonetheless rare events, and the\nother excitations being essentially local, we expect that\nthe deviation from \"ultralocality\" is small when \u03b2 is\nlarge, i.e.,\n(\u03b2)\n\nWh\n\n(\u03b2)UL\n\n\u2243 Wh\n\n[J (\u03b8)] + corrections,\n\n(37)\n\n\f7\n(\u03b2)UL\n\nwith the corrections going to zero (and Wh\ngoing to\na well defined limit) when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. In the following, we\nwill check the correctness of this behavior and show how\nin the FRG flow the contributions coming from errors in\nselecting the ground state actually become subdominant\nas one approaches the critical fixed point.\nIV. CUMULANTS OF THE RENORMALIZED\nDISORDER AND THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE\nCOPIES\nA.\n\nthe system is considered (see section II) and in the latter\nthe sources acting on the replicas are all taken equal. As\na consequence, in both cases, one has only access to cumulants in the specific configuration with all arguments\nequal. Quite differently in the present formalism, we consider multiple copies or replicas and supersources that explicitly break the (permutational) symmetry among these\nreplicas.50 We note in passing that, by construction, this\ntakes care of the problem coming from having to average the logarithm of the partition function over disorder\nwhen \u03b2 6= 0.\n\nWhy the need for multiple copies ?\n\nA central quantity is the random (\"free energy\") func(\u03b2)\ntional Wh [J ], introduced above. This random functional is characterized by its (functional) probability distribution or, alternatively, by the infinite set of its cumulants (if of course the cumulants exist). Dealing with\ncumulants has the advantage of involving an average over\nthe bare disorder: as a result, one recovers the translational (and rotational) invariance in Euclidean space\nwhich is otherwise broken by the space-dependent random field. In the following, we will therefore consider a\nformalism based on cumulants. However, a crucial point\nwhen working with such disorder-averaged quantities is\nthat one does not want to lose track of the rare events\nthat characterize systems with quenched disorder. For\nrandom-field models, these rare events are expected to\ntake the form of \"avalanches\" or \"shocks\" that are seen in\nthe dependence of the ground state on the applied source\nat zero temperature and of low-energy excitations known\nas \"droplets\" at nonzero temperature (see above). As\nshown in previous work,16\u201319,41\u201349 these phenomena show\nup in the cumulants of the renormalized disorder as a singular dependence on the arguments (for an illustration in\na simple zero-dimensional toy model, see Appendix A).\nDescribing such features therefore requires the functional\ndependence of the cumulants for generic arguments. For\ninstance, a complete characterization of the random func(\u03b2)\ntional Wh [J ] implies the knowledge of all its cumulants,\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nW1 [J1 ], W2 [J1 , J2 ], W3 [J1 , J2 , J3 ], ..., which are\ndefined as\n(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nW1 [J1 ] = Wh [J1 ]\n\n(38)\n\nB.\n\nMulti-copy superfield formalism\n(\u03b2)\n\nThe cumulants of Wh for generic arguments can be\nobtained from the average over the bare disorder of the\nextension of Eq. (30) to an arbitrary large number n\nof copies submitted to independently controllable (super)sources, namely,\n\nexp(W\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n\u2212\n\n(\u03b2)\nWh [J1 ]\n\n(\u03b2)\nWh [J2 ],\n\n(39)\n\netc. Generic, i.e. independently tunable, arguments require the introduction of several copies or replicas of the\noriginal system, each with the same bare disorder (random field) but coupled to different external supersources.\nIt is worth stressing that this is not what is done in the\nParisi-Sourlas supersymmetric approach nor in the conventional replica trick. In the former, a single copy of\n\n[{Ja }]) =\n\nn\nY\n\na=1\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nZh [Ja ]\n\nn\nX\n(\u03b2)\nWh [Ja ]).\n= exp(\n\n(40)\n\na=1\n\nWith the help of the curved superspace introduced above\nand by combining Eq. (30) and Eq. (40), we end up with a\nsuperfield theory associated with the following partition\nfunction:\nZ (\u03b2) [{Ja }] = exp(W (\u03b2) [{Ja }])\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ Y\nn\nn Z\nX\n=\nD\u03a6a exp \u2212 S (\u03b2) [{\u03a6a }] +\nJa (x)\u03a6a (x) ,\na=1\n\na=1\n\nx\n\n(41)\n\nwhere the multicopy action is given by\nS\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nn Z\nX\n1\n[ (\u2202\u03bc \u03a6a (x))2 + UB (\u03a6a (x))]\n[{\u03a6a }] =\n2\na=1 x\n(42)\nn\nn Z Z\n\u2206B X X\n\u03a6a (x, \u03b8 1 )\u03a6a2 (x, \u03b8 2 )\n\u2212\n2 a =1 a =1 x \u03b81 \u03b82 1\n1\n\nW2 [J1 , J2 ] =Wh [J1 ]Wh [J2 ]\n\n(\u03b2)\n\n2\n\nand it should be kept in mind that the integral over the\nGrassmann coordinates include\nR a Rmetric\nR R factor due to\nthe curvature \u03b2 (as a result, x \u2261 x\n(1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u0304\u03b8)d\u03b8d\u03b8\u0304).\nNote that for n \u2265 2 the first (kinetic) and last (disorderinduced) terms in the above expression of the multicopy\naction can no longer be combined and simply expressed\nwith the super-Laplacian, as it was the case for the 1copy action SSS [\u03a6] in the absence of curvature (\u03b2 = 0)\nwhich is defined in Eq. (13).\n(\u03b2)\n\nThe cumulants of Wh\n\ncan now be generated by the\n\n\f8\nexpansion in increasing number of sums over copies,\nW (\u03b2) [{Ja }] =\n\nn\nXX\n\n...\n\np\u22651 a1 =1\n\nn\nX\n1 (\u03b2)\nWp [Ja1 , ..., Jap ],\np!\na =1\np\n\n(43)\nis fully symmetric under\nwhere the pth cumulant\nany permutation of its arguments (and independent of\nn). As is obvious from the above equation, at least p\ndistinct copies must be considered to describe the pth\ncumulant with generic arguments, so that an arbitrary\nlarge number of copies (or replicas) are needed to generate all cumulants.\nBy using Eq. (36), the first cumulant can be formally\nrewritten as\nZ\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nW1 [1]\nW1 [J1 ] =\n(44)\n(\u03b2)\nWp\n\n\u03b81\n\n(\u03b2)\n\nwhere W1 [1] is a short-hand notation for indicating a functional of J1 (\u03b8 1 ), (1 + \u03b22 \u03b8\u03041 \u03b81 )\u2202\u03b81 J1 (\u03b81 ), and\n\u2206\u03b81 J1 (\u03b81 ) (the functional character comes from the Euclidean dependence that remains completely general at\nthis point); there is no additional explicit dependence on\n(\u03b2)\nGrassmann coordinates in W1 . The second cumulants\nreads\nZ Z\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nW2 [1, 2],\nW2 [J1 , J2 ] =\n(45)\n\u03b82\n\n\u03b81\n\nwith an obvious extension of the above notation, and similar expressions hold for the higher-order cumulants.

[37] that the above isometries\n(iii) and (iv) are the only possible ones in the presence\nof a nonzero curvature \u03b2. However, when the curvature\nis set to zero and, in addition, when restricting the supersources such that in all copies except a given copy a,\nthe components J\u02c6b = K\u0304b = Kb = 0 (b 6= a), the partition\nfunction in Eq. (41) is invariant under the superrotations\nconsidered in section III-B.

Invariance under the superrotations\nfollows directly.\nThe above continuous (super) symmetries imply a set\nof WT identities satisfied by the generating functionals\nW (\u03b2) [{Ja }] and \u0393(\u03b2) [{\u03a6a }].

EXPLORING THE FORMAL\nCONSEQUENCES OF \"GRASSMANNIAN\nULTRALOCALITY\"\nA.\n\nExpansion in \"ultralocal\" cumulants\n(\u03b2)\n\nAssume now that the random functional Wh is\n\"ultra-local\" in the Grassmann coordinates, which, as\ndiscussed before, implies that a unique configuration is\nincluded in the computation of the random generating\nfunctional for each realization of the random field. In\nthis case, the expansion of the generating functional\nW (\u03b2) [{Ja }] in increasing number of sums over copies,\n\nis known in the literature on disordered systems as \"connected\" correlation functions of the \u03c6 field. For instance,\nthe second derivative is related to the linear response of\nthe magnetization to a change of the applied magnetic\nfield.\nThe higher-order cumulants describe the distribution\nof the renormalized disorder. They generate through differentiation, and after setting all sources equal (J1 =\nJ2 = * * * = J), the so-called \"disconnected\" correlation\nfunctions of the original system. We introduce the notation\n(q1 ...qp )\n[J1 ...Jp ] =\nW p;x\n11 ..x1q1 ,...,xp1 ..xpqp\n\n\u03b4 q1 +...+qp Wp [J1 ...Jp ]\n.\n\u03b4J1 (x11 )..\u03b4J1 (x1q1 )...\u03b4Jp (xp1 )..\u03b4Jp (xpqp )\n\n(69)\n\n\f11\n(11)\n\nThen, for instance, W2;x1 ,x2 [J, J] is equal to the standard\ntwo-point \"disconnected\" correlation function defined in\nEq.

As before, the dependence on the Eu(\u03b2)\nclidean coordinates, which actually still makes the \u0393p 's\nnonlocal functionals of the superfields, is left implicit.\nThe proof is easily derived from the expression of the\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\n\u0393p 's in terms the Wq 's with q \u2264 p and the \"ultralocal\" property of the latter. A more specific discussion of\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\nthe relation between the \u0393p 's and the Wp 's is provided\nbelow.\nFrom the above property one can derive expressions\nfor the proper (1PI) vertices, defined as\n(\u03b2)\n\u0393p\n\n(p)\n\u0393(a1 ,x ),...,(ap,x ) [{\u03a6a }]\n1\np\n\n\u03b4 p \u0393(\u03b2) [{\u03a6a }]\n=\n,\n\u03b4\u03a6a1 (x1 )...\u03b4\u03a6ap (xp )\n\n(71)\n\nwhich will prove useful in the following.

It\nis however important to stress that our previous replica\napproach provides no obvious way to make the superrotational invariance (or lack of it) explicit and, therefore,\nek and\nneither to relate the two infrared cutoff functions R\nbk nor to provide guidance for devising nonperturbaR\ntive approximations to the ERGE's that do not explicitly\nbreak the underlying supersymmetry (see the companion\npaper).\n\nVII.\n\nand\n\n[0]\n[0]\n(11)\nek )Pb [0] [\u03c62 ], (113)\nPek [\u03c61 , \u03c62 ] = Pbk [\u03c61 ](\u0393k2 [\u03c61 , \u03c62 ] \u2212 R\nk\n\nwhich are obtained from Eqs.

Introducing the auxiliary temperature \u03b2 \u22121 has allowed us to\nplace the superfield formalism on a firm ground. However, being ultimately interested in studying the groundstate properties of the system, we would like to take\nthe limit \u03b2 \u22121 \u2192 0 in the exact flow equations derived\nabove. To make the dependence on \u03b2 explicit in the\nERGE's, we first rescale the Grassmann coordinates and,\naccordingly, the auxiliary fields: (\u03b8\u0304, \u03b8) = \u03b2 \u22121/2 (\u03c9\u0304, \u03c9),\n\u00ea\n\u0113 \u03c8),\ne and \u03c6\u0302 = \u03b2 \u03c6,\ne\nso that \u03a6(\u03b8) \u2261 \u03a6(\u03c9)\n(\u03c8\u0304, \u03c8) = \u03b2 1/2 (\u03c8,\n\u00ea\n\u0113 + \u03c9\u0304\u03c9 \u03c6.\ne\n= \u03c6 + \u03c9\u0304\u03c8e + \u03c8\u03c9\nwith \u03a6(\u03c9)\nThe cumulants associated with the effective average\naction can be formally written as\nZ\nZ\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\n...\n\u0393kp [1, ..., p],\n(116)\n\u0393kp [\u03a6a1 , ..., \u03a6ap ] =\n\u03b81\n\nwhere in the right-hand side, as in Eqs.

We will come back in more detail to the\nstructure of these flow equations in the following paper,\nbut we note for future reference that these equations are\n\n\u03b8p\n\n{\u03a6aq (\u03b8 q ), (1 +\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b8\u0304q \u03b8q ) \u2202\u03b8q \u03a6aq (\u03b8q ), \u2206\u03b8q \u03a6aq (\u03b8q )}.

This guarantees that the derivatives of the \"non-ultralocal\" contri(\u03b2)\nbutions to the \u0393kp 's do not come with increasing factors\nof \u03b2 which would completely spoil the limit of infinite\n\u03b2. We shall support this argument by studying the first\n\"non-ultralocal\" corrections (see below).\nThen, taking into account that an integral over a\n\n\f17\nGrassmann variable acts like a derivative leads to\nZ\nZ\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)\n...\n\u0393kp [1\u0303, ..., p\u0303].

Similar expressions are\nobtained for the higher-order cumulants.

The limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e allows\none to drop the terms in the above flow equations that\nhave an explicit factor of 1/\u03b2, namely the first term of\nthe right-hand sides. It should however be kept in mind\nthat as in the \"thermal\" case when T \u2192 0, the limit\n1/\u03b2 \u2192 0 is expected to be nonuniform in the (super)field\ndependence. This will be discussed further down and in\nthe following paper.\nHaving introduced the change of Grassmann coordinates and the formal way to study the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, we\ncan go one step beyond in the analysis of the ERGE's.\nTo do so, we consider superfields that are uniform in the\ne a = \u03c6a , and we genGrassmann subspace, i.e. \u03a6a = \u03a6\neralize the results of sections V-B and VI-B to the case\n(\u03b2)\nwhere the cumulants \u0393kp have a generic \"non-ultralocal\"\ncomponent,\nZ\nZ \u0012\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)UL e\ne\n\u0393kp [\u03a61 , ..., \u03a6p ] = \u03b2 p\n...\n\u0393kp [\u03a6\n1 (\u03c9 1 ), ..., \u03a6p (\u03c9 p )]\n\nZ\n\n(123)\n\n(\u03b2)N UL e\n\u0393kp\n[1, ..., pe]\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(124)\nwhere\ninvolves derivatives of the superfields in\nthe Grassmann directions and is equal to zero when the\nsuperfields are uniform in the Grassmann subspace: as a\n(\u03b2)\n(\u03b2)UL\nresult, \u0393kp [\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6p ] = \u03b2 p \u0393kp [\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6p ] .

This is an important piece in the resolution of the problem associated with the long-distance\nphysics of the model.\nB.\n\nIllustration of the RG flow for \"non-ultralocal\"\ncontributions\n\nWe now illustrate the structure of the FRG flow for the\n\"non-ultralocal\" components of the cumulants by looking\nat the lowest-order correction to the first cumulant, assuming that all other cumulants are purely \"ultralocal\".\nThis allows us to verify that this flow is well-behaved,\nthereby giving a direct confirmation to the arguments\nused in the previous subsection.

Scaling dimensions near a zero-temperature\nfixed point and asymptotic dominance of the ground\nstate\n\nTo search for the fixed point that controls the critical behavior of the RFIM associated with the spontaneous breaking of the (global) Z2 symmetry, the NPFRG flow equations must first be recast in a scaled form.\nThis can be done by introducing appropriate scaling\ndimensions.16,18 Near a zero-temperature fixed point, it\nis convenient to introduce a \"renormalized temperature\".\nAs shown in Refs. [16,18], this can be done by considering (i) the strength of the renormalized random field \u2206k ,\n(11)\nwhich can be defined from the vertex \u0393k2 evaluated for\na specific configuration of the fields and reduces to the\nbare value \u2206B at the UV scale \u039b, and (ii) the amplitude\nof the field renormalization constant Zk , which is as usual\n(2)\nobtained from \u0393k1 for a specific field configuration and\nis equal to 1 at the UV scale. Specifically,\n\nAn associated running exponent \u03b8k is defined from\n\u03b8k = \u2202t log Tk\n\nwhereas the (running) anomalous dimension \u03b7k is obtained as\n\u03b7k = \u2212\u2202t log Zk .\n\nZk k\n.\n\u2206k\n\n(140)\n\n(142)\n\nOne may also introduce a running exponent \u03b7\u0304k = 2 \u2212\n\u03b8k + \u03b7k from\n\u03b7\u0304k \u2212 2\u03b7k = \u2202t log \u2206k .\n\n(143)\n\nNote that the two anomalous dimensions \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 describe\nthe spatial decay of the pair \"connected\" and \"disconnected\" correlations functions (see section V) at criticality; this translates into\n[0]\n[0]\nPbk (q = 0) \u223c k \u2212(2\u2212\u03b7) , Pek (q = 0) \u223c k \u2212(4\u2212\u03b7\u0304) , (144)\n\nwith \u03b7 \u2264 \u03b7\u0304 \u2264 2\u03b7 2,55 .\nA systematic way to proceed is to introduce, on top of\nthe canonical scaling dimensions for the effective average\naction and the related cumulants and of a rescaling of the\nEuclidean momenta and coordinates (q\u0302 = q/k, x\u0302 = kx),\na rescaling of the Grassmann coordinates via a renormalized curvature \u03b2k \u221d 1/Tk , with Tk defined in Eq.

For instance, the term B\nk\n[0]\nb [\u03c6] is\nappearing in the definition of the propagator Q\nk\nexpressed as\nb [0] [\u03c6] = \u03b2k Zk k 2 b\u0302k [\u03c6].\nB\nk\n\n(151)\n\nThe dimensionless quantities will be systematically denoted by lower-case letters (except for the superfield and\nfor the coordinates, for obvious reasons).\nIn addition, and following the discussion in section VIB, the cutoff functions are chosen according to\nbk (q 2 ) = Zk k 2 s(q\u0302 2 ),\nR\n\n(152)\n\nek (q 2 ) = \u2212\u2206k s\u2032 (q\u0302 2 ),\nR\n\n(153)\n\nwith s(x) such that s(0) > 0 and s(x \u2192 \u221e) = 0 (see the\ncompanion paper and Refs.

Explicit expressions for the first cumulants are easily derived\nfrom Eqs. (134,135) and will be given in the following paper. Here, only the general structure is needed.\nFixed points are then found by setting the left-hand\nside of Eq. (154) to zero. This will be studied in detail in\nthe companion paper. At this point we would only like\nto stress that the \"non-ultralocal\" contributions to the\nflow of the dimensionless renormalized cumulants come\nwith a factor 1/\u03b2k . Even if \u03b2 \u22121 is not taken equal to\nzero, and provided the \"non-ultralocal\" contributions remain bounded (see following paper), the flow leads to\na fixed point characterized by the property of \"Grassmannian ultralocality\": one indeed expects 1/\u03b2k \u221d Tk\nto flow to zero, i.e. \u03b8k\u21920 > 0, as already shown in computer studies2 and in Refs. [17,19]. Ground-state dominance is thus found asymptotically as the flow goes to\n\nthe zero-temperature fixed point. Guided by our previous work17,19 and by that of Balents, Ledoussal and\ncoworkers on the random manifold model,44,46,47,49 we\nanticipate that when the fixed point is characterized by\na nonanalytic, cusp-like, dependence of the cumulants of\nthe renormalized random field, the approach to the k \u2192 0\nlimit (which coincides to the fixed point obtained by setting rightaway \u03b2 \u22121 = 0 in the ERGE's) involves a boundary layer, generically in |\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b |/Tk .56 This boundary\nlayer is physically associated with the presence of rare,\npower-law distributed, \"droplet\" excitations above the\nground state at the running scale k.57\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have extended our nonperturbative\nFRG approach of disordered systems, which was presented in the previous articles of this series.18,19 The objective was to discuss the property of dimensional reduction and its breakdown in the RFIM from the ParisiSourlas6 perspective of an underlying supersymmetry\nand its breaking. To this end, we have reformulated the\nFRG in a superfield formalism.\nWe have identified two sources of problems in the\nParisi-Sourlas supersymmetric formalism. One stems\nfrom the presence of metastable states which, due to the\nresulting multiplicity of solutions to the stochastic field\nequation that describes the long-distance physics of the\nRFIM, prevents the selection of the ground state in the\nrandom generating functional. The other one was already\ndiscussed in our previous papers and comes from the fact\nthat a single copy of the original system is considered. As\nsuch, the formalism is therefore unable to describe rare\nevents, such as avalanches and droplets, that manifest\nthemselves as nonanalyticities in the field dependence of\nthe cumulants of the renormalized disorder.\nWe have provided ways to cure both problems, through\nthe introduction of a weighting factor with an auxiliary\ntemperature and through the use of multiple copies. The\nresulting theory involves superfields in a curved superspace whose curvature is related to the inverse of the\nauxiliary temperature. The presence of metastable states\nleads to a breakdown of a formal property which we\nhave called \"Grassmannian ultralocality\" and is associated with the fact that a unique solution is incorporated in the random generating functional. On the other\nhand, as will be discussed in detail in the companion\npaper, nonanalyticities originating from the presence of\navalanches in the ground state as one varies the applied\nsource trigger a spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry,\nmore precisely of \"superrotational invariance\".\nThrough the introduction of an appropriate infrared\nregulator which guarantees that the stochastic field equation has a unique solution at the initial condition of the\nflow and which can be chosen to satisfy all (super) symmetries of the theory, we have derived exact RG flow\nequations for the cumulants of the renormalized disor-\n\n\f21\nder in the effective average action formalism. We have\nshown that in the limit of infinite curvature, i.e. of zero\nauxiliary temperature, the hierarchy of exact FRG equations coincides with that obtained under the hypothesis\nof \"Grassmannian ultralocality\". Through this procedure, the ground state is properly selected and is the\nonly solution that contributes to the random generating\nfunctional. We have moreover found that the corrections\nto \"ultralocality\" that are present for a finite curvature\nbecome subdominant at long distance as one approaches\nthe expected zero-temperature fixed point.\nIn the following paper, we investigate the exact FRG\nequations derived for the cumulants in the limit of infinite curvature and show that nonanalytic behavior of the\neffective average action in its field arguments is related to\nthe appearance of a spontaneous breaking of the superrotational invariance. We also devise and study a nonperturbative approximation scheme that does not break\nexplicitly the superrotational invariance and allows us to\nstudy the critical behavior of the RFIM and the breakdown of dimensional reduction as a function of the spatial\ndimension d.\n\nWe focus on a \"Green's function\" which, when a single solution is present and all constructions lead to the\nsame results, is obtained from the second derivative of the\n\u02c6 J), namely\nsecond cumulant of generating function W(J,\n[compare with Eq. (7)],\nh\u03c6(J1 + h)ih\u03c6(J2 + h)i\n\n\u2212 h\u03c6(J1 + h)i h\u03c6(J2 + h)i.\n\nAt T = 0, the thermal average h\u03c6i reduces to the ground\nstate \u03c60 , i.e. the absolute minimum of the action. In\nthe Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetric construction, h\u03c6i is\nreplaced by \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6\u2021 (in the range where the three\nsolutions coexit) and in the construction proposed in this\nwork (see section III-B), h\u03c6i is replaced by a Boltzmannlike weighted average with an auxiliary temperature \u03b2 \u22121 .\nAs we want to study the possible nonanalyticities in\nthe dependence on the sources J1 , J2 as J2 \u2192 J1 , we\nrewrite J1 = J \u2212 \u03b4J, J2 = J + \u03b4J and consider the limit\n\u03b4J \u2192 0. Moreover, we consider the difference between\nthe Green's functions\n\u03c6\u2217 (J + \u03b4J + h)\u03c6\u2217 (J \u2212 \u03b4J + h) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 (J + h)2 ,\n\nAppendix A: \"Metastable\" states and\nnonanalyticities in the zero-dimensional RFIM\n\nIn section III, we have introduced the property of\n\"Grassmannian ultralocality\" by considering the simple\ncase of the d = 0 RFIM at zero temperature. We use\nthis same toy model here to illustrate on the one hand\nthe different proposed ways to construct generating functionals when \"metastable\" states are present and on the\nother hand the nonanalyticities that may be present in\nthe field (or source) dependence of these functionals and\nof the associated Green's functions. In the d = 0 RFIM,\na variable \u03c6 is submitted to an interaction characterized\nby the action:\nS(\u03c6) = UB (\u03c6) \u2212 (J + h)\u03c6,\n\n(A1)\n\nwith, as in Eq.

This is a situation where one encounters\nmultiple solutions or \"metastable states\".\n\n(A3)\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere we have dropped the difference in the disconnected\npieces that is easily shown to be at least of O(\u03b4J 2 ) and\n\u03c6\u2217 is given by any of the three above definitions (ground\nstate, Parisi-Sourlas weighting, Boltzmann-like weighting). The expression in Eq.

It is easy to show that\n\u03c6\u2217 (J + \u03b4J + h)\u03c6\u2217 (J \u2212 \u03b4J + h) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 (J + h)2 is of order\nO(\u03b4J 2 ) everywhere except in a region centered around\nJ + h = 0 and of width 2\u03b4J, where the function is of\norder 1 (actually \u221212|\u03c4 |/u). Averaging over the disorder\ntherefore generates a linear cusp in \u03b4J,\n\u03c6\u2217 (J + \u03b4J + h)\u03c6\u2217 (J \u2212 \u03b4J + h) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 (J + h)2 =\n24\nJ2\n\u2212\u221a\nexp(\u2212\n)|\u03b4J| + O(\u03b4J 2 ).\n2\u2206B\n2\u03c0u\u2206B\nb.\n\n(A5)\n\nParisi-Sourlas weighting\n\nIf we use the prescription that \u03c6\u2217 = \u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u03c6\u2021 when\nthe three solutions coexist (i.e. for \u2212Jc < J +h < Jc ) and\n\u03c6\u2217 is given by the unique solution otherwise, the function\n\u03c6\u2217 (J + h) is now continuous but presents a nonanalytic\nbehavior around \u00b1Jc .

It is now easy to show that \u03c6+ +\u03c6\u2212 \u2212\u03c6\u2021 goes\nto zero as O(\u03b4J 2 ) everywhere except in regions of width\n\u03b4J around J +\u221ah = \u00b1Jc . In these regions, the function\nbehaves as O( \u03b4J).

However, this nonanalytic behavior originates\nfrom branches that are not absolute minima of the action\nand should therefore be discarded in studying equilibrium\nbehavior. It is an artifact of the Parisi-Sourlas construction.\n\nhowever must be larger than p to give access to the full\nfunctional dependence).\nFor instance, to relate the terms of the expansion of\nthe effective action \u0393[{\u03a6a }] [we omit the superscript (\u03b2)\nthroughout this appendix] to those of the expansion of\nW [{Ja }], i.e. the cumulant of Wh , one can use a pedestrian method that starts with the Legendre transform in\nEq.

Keeping the superfields\nP R {\u03a6a } as variables, we\nalso expand \u2212W[{Ja }] + a x Ja (x)\u03a6a (x) in number\nof sums over copies as\n\u0013\nZ\nX\u0012\n\u2212 W1 [Ja [{\u03a6f }]] + Ja (\u03b8; {\u03a6f })\u03a6a (\u03b8) \u2212\n\u03b8\n\na\n\nX 1\np! a\np\u22652\n\nc.\n\nBoltzmann-like weighting\n\u2212\u03b2S+\n\n1 =1\n\n..\n\nn\nX\n\nap =1\n\n(B1)\n\nWp [Ja1 [{\u03a6f }], .., Jap [{\u03a6f }]],\n\nwhere the supersource has the following expansion:\n\u2212\u03b2S\u2212\n\n\u2212\n+ \u03c6\u2212 e\nIn this case, one has \u03c6\u2217 = (\u03c6+ e\n\u03c6\u2021 e\u2212\u03b2S\u2021 )/(e\u2212\u03b2S+ + e\u2212\u03b2S\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2S\u2021 ) where S+ = S(\u03c6+ ),\netc, when the three solutions coexist and \u03c6\u2217 is given by\nthe unique solution otherwise. As in the Parisi-Sourlas\nweighting, \u03c6\u2217 (J + h) is continuous with a nonanalytic\nbehavior around \u00b1Jc . In this case however, the resulting nonanalyticity in |\u03b4J|3/2 in the difference of Green's\nfunctions, Eq. (A4), is exponentially damped by a factor\nexp(\u2212\u03b2\u2206S) where \u2206S is the difference of action between\nthe ground state and the first excited state.\nThe behavior of \u03c6\u2217 around J + h = 0 is continuous and\nregular, but with a rapid change of O(1) over a narrow\ninterval of width O(\u03b2 \u22121 ). After averaging over disorder,\nthis gives rise to a \"boundary layer\" in \u03b2|\u03b4J|, i.e.,\n\u03c6\u2217 (J + \u03b4J + h)\u03c6\u2217 (J \u2212 \u03b4J + h) \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 (J + h)2 =\n\n\u03b2 \u22121 f (J, \u03b2|\u03b4J|) + O(e\u2212\u03b2\u2206S |\u03b4J|3/2 , \u03b4J 2 ),\n\nn\nX\n\n(A7)\n\nwith f (J, y) = f2 (J)y 2 + * * * when y \u2192 0 and f (J, y) \u223c\nfc (J)y when y \u2192 \u221e.\nWhen \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, the spurious nonanalyticity in |\u03b4J|3/2\nvanishes exponentially fast whereas the boundary layer\nleads to a linear cusp in |\u03b4J|.

We\nrecall that the pth term of such an expansion involves\nexactly p copies and is a symmetric and continuous functional of either p copy superfields or p copy supersources\n(depending on whether one works with superfields or supersources as fundamental variables), the functional form\nbeing independent of the total number of copies (which\n\nn\nX\n(\u22121)p\n(p + 1)!\nap =1\np\u22651 a1 =1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(10..0)\n(0..01)\n\u0393p+1,\u03b8..

(47) and we symmetrize the output if\nnecessary. The first orders are easily derived and are\ngiven in Eqs. (51-55). Higher-order terms are similarly\nderived. One finds that the pth term \u0393p [\u03a6a1 , .., \u03a6ap ] is\nequal to (\u22121)p Wp [J [\u03a6a1 ], .., J [\u03a6ap ]], where J [\u03a6a ] is the\nnonrandom supersource defined in Eq. (54), plus terms\ninvolving cumulants Wq with q < p that are also functionals of the nonrandom supersource.\nWe also have to consider the expansion in increasing\nnumber of sums over copies of matrices, as in section\nVI-C. A generic matrix A(a1 x1 )(a2 x2 ) [{\u03a6a }] can then be\nexpressed as in Eqs. (103,104,105). Algebraic manipulations on such matrices can again be performed through\na term-by-term identification of the orders of the expansions. For instance, the inverse B = \"A\u22121 \" of the matrix\nA in the sense of Eq. (49), i.e.\nXZ\n(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03043 \u03b83 )\n(1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u03041 \u03b81 )\u03b4a1 a2 \u03b4x1 x2 =\nx3\n(B3)\na3\n\u00d7 B(a1 x1 )(a3 x3 ) [{\u03a6a }]A(a3 x3 )(a2 x2 ) [{\u03a6a }],\n\ncan also be put in the form of Eq. (103) and its components, Bba1 and Bea1 a2 , can be expanded in number of sums\nover copies. The term-by-term identification of both sides\nof Eq. (B3) leads to a unique expression of the various\norders, Bb[p] and Be[p] , of the expansion of B in terms of\nthe Ab[q] 's and Ae[q] 's with q \u2264 p. The algebra becomes\nrapidly tedious, but the first few terms are easily derived.\n\n\f23\nBb[0] is the inverse of Ab[0] , i.e.,\nZ\n(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03043 \u03b83 )Bbx[0]1 x3 [\u03a61 ]Ab[0]\nx3 x2 [\u03a61 ] = (1 + \u03b2 \u03b8\u03041 \u03b81 )\u03b4x1 x2 ,\nx3\n\nthe third cumulant by three filled circles joined by dashed\nlines\n\n2\n\n(B4)\n\nwhereas\n\nBex[0]1 x2 [\u03a61 , \u03a62 ]\n\n=\u2212\n\nand\nBb[1] [\u03a61 |\u03a62 ] = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nx3\n\nZ\n\nx4\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03043 \u03b83 )(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03044 \u03b84 )\n\nb[0]\nBbx[0]1 x3 [\u03a61 ]Ae[0]\nx3 x4 [\u03a61 , \u03a62 ]Bx4 x2 [\u03a62 ]\nZ\n\nx3\n\nZ\n\nx4\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03043 \u03b83 )(1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u03b8\u03044 \u03b84 )\n\n(B5)\n\nZ\n\nx\n\nZ\n\nx\n\nx1\nx2\n\n(B7)\n\nAppendix C: A graphical representation of the\nhierarchy of ERGE's for the cumulants\n\nIn this appendix we give a graphical representation of\nthe flow equations for the cumulants \u0393kp . We concentrate on the replica structure and remain general on the\nway the momentum and Grassmann coordinates must\nbe integrated over in the loops. Similarly, we use a notation with \"simple\" fields but superfields could be used as\nwell. In doing so, we obtain results which apply to the\ncurved space, to the \"ultralocal\" case (when curvature\ndrops out), but also in the replica formalism of papers I\nand II.18,19\nIt is convenient to represent the first cumulant by a\nfilled circle\n(C1)\n\nthe second cumulant by two filled circles joined by a\ndashed line\n\n2\n1\n\n\u2192\n\n\u0393k2 [\u03c61 , \u03c62 ]\n\n(q)\n\n\u2192\n\n\u0393k1,x\n\n1 ***xq\n\n[\u03c61 ]\n\n(C5)\n\nxq\nFor the second cumulant, we must specify on which\ncircle we extract the leg.

(24), i.e. where the integrand at some \"point\" \u03b8\ndepends on the superfield at this point but not on its\nderivatives in the Grassmann directions. However, this is\nan abuse of language as one should keep in mind that\nthe notions of locality and neighborhood in a Grassmann\nspace are not well defined. As a result, some properties that would seem obvious with bosonic coordinates\nare not satisfied with anticommuting coordinates. For\ninstance, even Rthough the action with the supersource\nterm, Sh [\u03a6] \u2212 \u03b8 J (\u03b8)\u03a6(\u03b8) is \"ultralocal\" in the Grassmann\nso for Wh [J ] =\nR subspace, this Ris not necessarily\n\u0001\nlog D\u03a6 exp Sh [\u03a6] \u2212 \u03b8 J (\u03b8)\u03a6(\u03b8) , as seen with Eq.
