In addition to stabilization, the\norganic shell and/or the presence of some specific\ngroups in the corona may also confer some\nfunctionality to the high surface area of the\nnanoparticles. Surface derivatization is crucial in\nbiomedical\napplications\nlike\ndrug\ndelivery,\nimmunoassay or cell imaging where the control of the\ninteraction between the nanoparticles and biomacromolecules, cells or living tissues drives\ntoxicity1,9,10.\n\nI \u2013 Introduction\nThe size\u2013dependent properties of nanoparticles have\ngenerated diverse scientific interests. Their high\nsurface area, shape, surface chemistry and intrinsic\nproperties (dielectric constant, radiation absorption,\nsensitivity to external field...) are currently fueling\ninnovations and driving technological breakthroughs in\nmany areas. These range from biotechnology1, 2,\noptics3, photonics4, electronics5, energy 6, 7 to materials\nscience8. Numerous synthesis routes of inorganic\nnanoparticles now exist in the literature and availability\nof small (< 10 nm), fairly monodisperse and\nnon-aggregated inorganic nanoparticle of various\nchemistries is no longer a constraint. The primary\nlimitation of \"solubility\" or inorganic nanosol stability to\nperturbation from their \"as synthesized\" state during\nprocessing represents the critical challenge for any\ngiven application. The sols are extremely sensitive to\nchanges in their physico-chemical environment such as\npH, ionic strength, temperature and concentration often\nleading to aggregation. The need to offset the attractive\nvan der Waals interaction that drives the aggregation of\nthe particles is particularly significant for dense\nnanoscale inorganic particles with low interparticle\nminimum radial separations. This has been addressed\nthrough the adsorption of an organic layer (corona,\nshell or adlayer) around the particle promoting an\nelectro-steric or steric stabilization of the sol. This\ncomplexation is prevalent in organic solvents in the\n\nMetal-oxide nanocrystals such as cerium (CeO2), iron\n(Fe2O3), zirconium (ZrO2) and titanium (TiO2) oxides\nrepresent a particularly important class of inorganic\nnanoparticle systems widely used in the diverse fields\nabove. Despite this diversity in chemistry and\napplication these particles share some common\nfeatures. Their synthesis usually occurs in very acidic\n(or basic) environments by precipitation of metallic\nsalts. The result is a stabilized sol at low pH (typically <\npH 2) via electrostatic repulsion between particles. The\nmain drawback is a very acute sensitivity to any\nvariation of physicochemical conditions in the aqueous\nsolution. In order to increase their stability range, low\nmolecular weight molecules or ligands like citric acid11\nor poly(acrylic acid)12 are generally used. The COOH\ngroups of the ligands form complexes with the surface\nhydroxyl groups of the nanoparticles. At sufficiently\nhigh pH where the carboxylic groups are ionized (> pH\n= 5), electrostatic stabilization of the sol occurs. The\n1\n\n\fdiameters are measured and plotted versus the mixing\nratio X (Figure 1). X = 10-4 corresponds to a solution\ncontaining PPEG oligomers only. X = 1000\ncorresponds to a solution containing bare nanoceria\nparticles only. When X decreases from 1000 to 0.01,\nthe size of the coated nanoceria increases gradually up\nto a critical value noted XP where it then saturates\naround DH = 13 nm. We interpret this result as the\nprogressive coating of the particles by the oligomers\nuntil full coverage occurring at XP. By further\ndecreasing X, the number of fully covered particles\ndecreases until their number is too low to be detected\nby DLS (around X ~ 0.01). The normalized Rayleigh\nRatio (normalization by the Rayleigh Ratio of the bare\nnanoceria RNP(X = \u0001), as measured by SLS, is also\nmonitored as a function of X. Here as well, one can\nclearly identify a critical ratio X equal to XP where the\nRayleigh Ratio starts to decrease progressively with X.\nWe interpret this result as the dilution of the fully\ncovered particles by the free oligomers present in the\nbulk, in agreement with DLS results.\n\nfundamental physical and chemical characteristics\nunderlining the formation of the complexations are not\nstraightforward since the complexations require some\nmechanical stress (shear, high energy ultrasounds)13,14\nto re-disperse the sol or a two step process (low pH\naggregation - high pH re-dispersion12). The electrosteric\nrepulsion conveyed via the ligands (eg. carboxylic\ngroups) though less sensitive to perturbations of pH\nand/ or ionic strength compared to the bare sols is still\nionic and serves only to extend utility for limited\napplication. Alternatively, the use of head-tail\narchitecture has been shown recently to be an efficient\nstrategy for the dispersion of alumina nanoparticles15\n(PEG tail and a gallol anchoring group) or the surface\nmodification of yttrium oxide nanoparticles16.\nWe report a facile complexation process giving rise to\nrobust and versatile hybrid metal oxide nanoparticle\nsols with a well anchored neutral corona for wide\napplicability. This process obviates the necessity for\nspecialized processing steps as precipitation\u2013\nredispersion. The choice of the complexing group(s),\nanchored on the particle surface, and the nature of the\noligomeric tail, in the solvent, is of paramount\nimportance. Among various anionic moieties it has\nbeen shown that phosphonic acid groups bind strongly\nto a variety of metal oxide surfaces at room\ntemperature in aqueous solution16,17.\nWe also chose polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups that\nare widely used in biomedical applications to prevent\nnon-specific adsorption of proteins18. An end grafted\nPEG layer may provide some biological stealth to the\nhybrid metal oxide nanosols19.\nAlong these lines, we highlight the potential and\nversatility of phosphonic acid terminated PEG\noligomers\nto\nfunctionalize\nrare\nearth\noxide\nnanoparticles. Cerium oxide is chosen to illustrate this\napproach due to its growing importance in science and\ntechnology ranging from material science (catalysis,\npolishing, optics...)20-24 to biomedical25-27 applications.\n\nFigure 1. Raleigh ratio and hydrodynamic radius DH vs. X\nat low pH (pH = 1.5). The continuous line is a fit to the\ndata using a non-stoichiometric model for adsorption (see\nthe analysis section). In the white region the fully covered\nparticles coexist with free PPEG oligomers.\n\nIn the following section, we describe, characterize and\nmodel the complexation process and the resulting\nnanostructure of the hybrid particles. We then\nunderscore two key attributes of the tailored sol: i)\nstrong UV absorption capability after functionalization\nand ii) ability to re-disperse after freeze-drying as\npowder in aqueous or organic solvents in varying\nconcentrations as singlet nanocolloids.\n\nTo confirm the existence of a critical volume ratio at XP\nbelow which particles are fully covered, the pH of the\nsolutions is raised (it should be recalled that bare\nnanoceria solutions start to aggregate at pH = 3 and\nprecipitate above pH = 5)28. At pH = 9, a solution made\nat X < XP remains stable suggesting that the steric\nrepulsion generated by the PEG layer is sufficient\nenough to prevent the destabilization of the sol. This\nresult is confirmed by a Rayleigh Ratio equal to the\nvalue found at pH = 1.5. Above XP, as expected, the\nsolution begins to aggregate due to the lack of\n\nResults and discussion\nLight scattering\nTo understand and model the adsorption of the\noligomers onto the nanoceria particles, hybrid solutions\nare prepared as a function of the volume ratio X\ndefined in equation 7 with an overall concentration c\nkept constant.

Using\nexpression (1) described in a former publication12 and\nvalues from Table 1 one finds 270 \u00b1 30 phosphonatePPEG per CeO2 particle.\n\nFurthermore, a comprehensive description of the\nbehavior of the coated particles as a function of pH and\nmixing ratio X is undertaken. A large number of\ndifferent experimental conditions are gathered in Figure\n3 representing the whole stability phase diagram of the\nCeO2-PPEG hybrid nanoparticles. As the pH is\nprogressively increased, the solutions become\ndestabilized at pH > 10.5. This critical upper stability\nlimit is identical to the pKa of the (110) and the (111)\nfacet of the ceria nanocrystal unit cell when the charge\nchanges from zwitterionic to negative28. We postulate\ndesorption of the phosphonated-PEG at this pH due to\nthe co-incidence of the transition to the aggregated\nstate (see section 3.3). Another feature of this phase\ndiagram is the existence of a general critical X = XP For\nall values of X > XP, the particle size increases\nprogressively at a lower pH leading to early phase\nseparation.\n\nFigure 3.

Careful\nDLS measurements are able to distinguish a different\nbehavior for coated and non coated particles. Using the\nStokes-Einstein relation, the hydrodynamic diameters\nDH of bare and PPEG coated nanoparticles were found\n\nThe two slopes are different because the Rayleigh\nRatio is proportional to K and MW, as shown in equation\n11. The slopes of the linear regressions for the CeO2PPEG and CeO2 Rayleigh ratios versus the CeO2\nweight fraction are 0.1284 and 0.0743, respectively.\nThe clear difference in the 2 slopes gives us the\n3\n\n\fPEG onto nanoceria particles. Below the critical volume\nratio XP, the particles are fully covered and in equilibrium\nwith a decreasing number of non-absorbed oligomers.\nAbove XP, the number of grafted oligomers progressively\ndecreases toward bare particles (X = \u0001). At Xp, all the\noligomers present in the initial solution are adsorbed onto\nthe particle.\n\nto be DH = 9.2 nm and DH = 12.3 nm respectively. One\ncan estimate a thickness of 1.6 nm for the PPEG\ncorona. The theoretical fully extended contour length of\nthe PPEG molecules is about 4.5 nm. The difference\nexpresses the grafting density of the PPEG onto the\nparticle (270 chains per particles or 1 chain/nm2) typical\nfor oligomers adsorbing onto nanoparticles15 (the non\nspherical shape of the particle might also play a role). A\nmonolayer of PPEG densely grafted (and fully\nstretched) would give a grafting density of 4 chains/nm2\nPPEG. The non-fully stretched configuration of the\nPPEG is however sufficient to provide a very good\nsteric stabilization.\n\nFrom a closer look to the data of Figure 1, and within\nthe experimental error of the light scattering technique,\nDH appears quite constant (around 13 nm) up to a\nvalue of X close to XP when it starts do drop smoothly\nuntil it reaches the value of the bare nanoceria particle\n(9.2 nm) at X = \u0001 (extreme point on the right). This\nbehavior suggests a NST model for the adsorption. In\naddition, no precipitation above XP is seen in the phase\ndiagram (Figure 2) for pH < 4. This result is in\ncontradiction with a ST model that would predict the\ncoexistence between bare and coated particles leading\nto the aggregation of a portion of the sol. Therefore, a\nnon-stoichiometric adsorption mechanism is selected to\nmodel the oligomer adsorption onto the nanoparticles.\nIn what follows, the X-dependence of the scattered\nintensity will be modeled accordingly.\nIn the experiments described previously, the total\nconcentration c of active matter (CeO2 + PPEG) is kept\nconstant. The respective nanoparticles and oligomers\nconcentration are given by equation 7 regardless of\nany interaction between them.

The scattered\nintensity I(q) of spherical objects can be decomposed\ninto a structure factor S(q) and form factor P(q) . At\nsufficiently low concentration (< 1wt. %), the structure\nfactor is equal to 1 (no interparticle interaction), the\nscattered intensity is proportional to the concentration\nand the q-dependence of the intensity reflects the form\nfactor P(q) of the aggregates. Figure 6 shows the form\nfactor of both bare and modified particles. Because the\nmeasurements of the scattered intensity are performed\nin H2O and D2O for the CeO2 and PPEG-CeO2 system\nrespectively, the curves at high q can not be\nsuperimposed. The extra contribution to the scattered\nintensity due to the presence of the organic layer is,\nhowever, clearly seen at low q in the Guinier\nrepresentation where Rgq < 1 (inset Figure 6). Here, the\nlogarithm of the intensity decreases linearly with q 2 and\nfrom the straight lines, we deduce a radius of gyration\nRg = 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 nm for the bare nanoparticles and Rg =\n4.4 \u00b1 0.1 nm for the PPEG coated ones. For\nhomogeneous and monodisperse spheres of radius R,\nR = RH = 1.29 Rg. In the present case, for the bare\nparticles, we find RH/Rg ~ 1.44. The discrepancy likely\nreflects the polydispersity in size of the cerium oxide\nparticles. In the Porod representation (I(q)\u0001q4, not\nshown here), the first oscillation of the form factor shifts\ntoward lower q after the coating (from 0.11 to 0.07)\nsupporting the presence of the organic layer. However,\ndue to polydispersity it is difficult to extract the radius R\nof the particles (qpeak R = 4.57). In addition, from\nexperiments performed with solutions having different\nH2O/D2O volume ratios it is possible to measure the\n\nFigure 6.

As seen in Figure 7, in both\nvalues of pH investigated the curves present a rather\nsharp increase of the adsorbed amount at very low\nconcentration. This rapid flattening out of the adsorbed\namount suggests a rather high affinity of the oligomers\ntoward cerium oxide surface.

Though the exact nature of the bond\nbetween PPEG and ceria is not known at this stage,\nthe measured free energies might indicate an\nadsorption mechanism controlled by electrostatic\ninteraction15. At pH = 1.5 the ceria nanoparticles are\ncationically charged (CeO-H2+) and the PPEG are only\nslightly anionic (3%, pK1 ~ 2.7). However, it has been\nreported 33, 34 in the literature that the presence of\noppositely\ncharged\nnanoparticles\ncan\naffect\nconsiderably the acid-basic properties of weak polyacid by making group or chain ionization easier.\nAlthough we do not know at this stage how to quantify\nsuch mechanism, it can possibly apply in our system\nand explain the presence of a larger charge on the\nweak phosphonic acid at low pH leading to the strong\nadsorption measured.\n\nAdsorption isotherms\n\n\u0001 (c ) =\n\nk\nm\nVwater\n\npH=6.5\n\n1.0\n\nwhere \u0001sat is the maximum adsorbed amount, c is the\n(equilibrium) concentration of oligomers in the aqueous\nsolution and k is the adsorption constant ( =\n\n0.5\n\nk adsorption\n). The fit gives values of \u0001sat = 1.8 mg/m2,\nk desorption\nk = 1.6 105 l/mol and \u0001sat = 0.8 mg/m2, k = 1.4 10 5\n\n0.0\n\nl/mol for pH = 1.5 and pH = 6.5 respectively. In both\ncase k is quite large leading to small values for kdesorption\n, consistent with a high affinity type of isotherm. The\nmagnitudes of the adsorbed amounts are typical for\norganic matter adsorbing onto inorganic surfaces. The\nadsorbed amount (at pH = 1.5) computed from light\nscattering results (DH = 9.2 nm, 270 oligomers/NP) is\nequal to 1.1 mg/m2 (assuming a spherical shape for the\nNP). Hence, both approaches agree reasonably well. In\naddition, due to a size comparable to a nanoparticle, an\noligomer adsorbing on top of the ceria model surface\ndoes not see a homogeneous layer, but rather a\ncompact set of nanoceria spheres with at most a 90 %\ncoverage (in the case of an hexagonal close-packing).\nThis layer develops a surface area of 2\u0001R2 \u0002 number of\nparticles (the surface area of hemispheres of radius R).\nThe renormalized adsorbed amount is ~ 1 mg/m2 in\nvery good agreement with the value found through light\nscattering experiments.\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0005\nc (mol/l)\n\n0.0010\n\nFigure 7. Adsorption isotherms \u0001( c) of PPEG oligomers\nonto model CeO2-coated substrates at low (1.5) and\nneutral pH (6). The solid curve is the Langmuir fit to the\ndata.\n\nAt pH = 6.5, close to its IEP, ceria nanoparticles are\nless cationic and PPEG oligomers are 50% anionically\ncharged (pK2 ~ 7.8). The lower amount measured at\nhigher pH may be due to electrostatic repulsion\nbetween the charged oligomers while adsorbing onto\nthe surface. At this pH, the presence of more than one\ncharged group in the phosphonated head could\npossibly force the oligomers into a flatter configuration\nleading to a lower adsorbed amount as well. The acidbasic interaction between the hydroxyl groups (Ce-OH)\nof the ceria and the remaining phosphonic acid groups\n(O = P-(OH)) of the PPEG might also favor adsorption\nleading possibly to a Ce-O-P = O bond with the release\nof a H2O molecule. The reactivity of phosphonic acid\ngroups toward metal oxide surfaces is known to\n6\n\n\fcorrelate with its basicity35. In the case of yttrium oxide\n(Y2O3) nanoparticles (yttrium and cerium are rare earth\nelements with similar electronegativity and ionic radii)36\nthe reaction (\u0001\u0002esterification\u0002\u0002) takes place at room\ntemperature16. Furthermore, the modified CeO2 sol was\nable to withstand a week-long dialysis against pure\nwater without aggregating, highlighting the robustness\nof the organic coating. It should be noted finally that at\nvery high pH (> 11), the sol precipitates, as can be\nseen in the phase diagram of Figure 2 indicating\npossible hydrolysis of Ce-O-P bonds in the aggressive\nalkaline environment as the ceria surface changes\ncharacter from zwitterionic to anionic28 . The adsorption\nresults give evidence of the specificity of a\nphosphonated oligomer to create a robust metal oxide\nhybrid sol.\n\nBenefits: UV\nNanopowders\n\nabsorption\n\nand\n\nconcentrated solutions was evaluated by drying the\nhybrid nanosol. A second important matter is the\npossibility to handle powders rather than solutions to\nimprove the shelf life expectancy or simply to prepare\nsolutions in a different solvent.\n\nRedispersible\n\nThe data and models offer a clear insight into the\nformulation process and the nanostructure of the\nmodified hybrid nanoparticles, and translate into two\nvaluable bulk properties of the new sol: UV absorption\nand the creation of redispersible nanopowders by\nfreeze drying the nanosol.\nOne of the well known characteristic properties of\ncerium oxide particles is strong UV absorbance with\nminimal absorbance in the visible regime. However,\ngiven the large surface area once covered with an\norganic layer and the possibility to form metal-ligand\ncharge transfer complexes this unique property may be\nadversely\naffected.\nWe\nundertook\nUV-visible\nmeasurements in order to rule out this hypothesis. As\nseen in Figure 8, both bare and coated nanoceria have\nthe same absorbance variation through the entire UVvisible region. This result is valuable because the\nrobustness of the PPEG-Ceria nanoparticle sol that has\nbeen investigated in this work has direct impact for\napplications where anti-UV protection is needed.\n\nFigure 9.

The inset\nshows the derived hydrodynamic radii DH distribution. a)\nid. hybrid sol. For sake of comparison, the diffusion\ncoefficients have been measured at a concentration of\n0.1%. They have not been extrapolated to zero\nconcentration leading to slightly smaller DH than in Table\n1.\n\nTo further investigate this idea, we freeze-dried\n(Freezone model, Labconco, Kansas City, MO) bare\nand hybrid nanoceria solutions for 48 hours to remove\nany trace of the water. The phosphonated-PEG ceria\nsolution was dialyzed (5K membrane) against DI water\nprior to freeze-drying, to remove any free PPEG\noligomers present in the bulk.\nAliquots of the freeze dried powders so prepared when\nadded to water showed a remarkable result that the\nhybrid nanosols appeared to readily redisperse to give\nclear solutions when compared to bare nanoparticles\nwhich evidenced a slightly milky appearance. Both\npowders were re-dispersed in aqueous solutions at pH\n= 1.5 for bare particles and DI water for stabilized\nparticles and stirred overnight. Figure 9 shows the\ncorrelation functions measured with dynamic light\nscattering (at 90o) of the original and modified sol\n\nFigure 8. UV-visible spectra of bare and coated\nnanoceria.\n\nAnother test for the robustness of the surface\nmodification and the ability to prepare stable\n7\n\n\fthe organic coating progressively diminishes,\nincreasing the sensitiveness of the sol toward\ndestabilization. In addition, the measurement of the free\nenergy of adsorption \u0001Gads (~ - 16 kT) has shown that\nelectrostatic interaction is likely the main driving force\nthe complexation which eventually increased the\naffinity of the phosphonate anchoring groups toward\nthe CeO2 surface.\n\nbefore and after re-dispersion. The distributions P(D) of\nthe hydration diameters DH are also shown (inset\nFigure 9). After re-dispersion, the correlation function of\nthe bare CeO2 solution is clearly shifted toward longer\ntimes. As a result, the mean DH is shifted toward larger\nvalues together with a clear broadening of the\ndistribution (DH = 26.8 \u00b1 11.4 nm) compared to the\nsmall and slightly polydisperse particles in the original\nsolution (DH = 8.5\u00b1 0.8 nm). Freeze drying the reactive\nbare CeO2 particles would likely have led to some\ncondensation between Ce-OH groups present on their\nsurfaces giving rise to larger aggregates. In the case of\npassivated PPEG-CeO2 particles, the freeze-drying\nprocess did not significantly change the original\ndistribution indicating no change in the surface\ncomplexation of PPEG during the drying process. Both\ncorrelation functions are almost superimposed giving a\nvery similar distribution of DH (DH = 12 \u00b1 0.1.4 and DH =\n12.7 \u00b1 1.5). This redispersibility is only possible for\ncompositions where X < XP. This hybrid metal oxide\nnanopowder has ability to overcome strong van der\nWaals attractions by hydration/solvation of the PPEG\ncorona yielding singlet nanocolloids while the formation\nof the barrier coating at the particle interface protects\nagainst interparticle chemical condensation. This has\nclear implications for the utility of nanoceria providing\nclear cost and processing advantages in allowing\nshipping of nanopowders rather than dilute solutions\nand in the preparation of stable concentrated solutions\nfor bulk applications.\n\nThe main specificities of the original sol are not altered\nduring the functionalization phase leading to nanometer\nsize cerium oxide particles covered with a well\nanchored layer of PEG chains. This solvating brush-like\nlayer is sufficient to solubilize the particles and greatly\nexpands the stability range of the original sol up to pH\n= 9. These results highlight the specificity of the\nterminus phosphonate group to create a robust metal\noxide hybrid sol. Furthermore, tailoring the oligomer\narchitecture with both a non interacting PEG tail and a\nmono-functional phosphonate head prevented colloidal\nbridging emphasizing the advantage of the current\nfunctionalization route over other ones using multisticker binding. Some direct benefits o f such hybrid\nsols are finally put forward. A fter functionalization,\nthe y maintain a strong UV absorption capabilit y, a\nver y valuable characteristic for applications where\nanti-UV protection is needed. Moreover, a fter freezedrying the h ybrid particle solution, the powder was\nable to re-disperse in dif ferent solvents without\nlosing any o f its features conferring a great\nversatilit y and ease o f use of the CeO2-PPEG\nnanoparticles in dr y or wet conditions. Beside their\nbulk properties described in this paper, the hybrid\nnanoparticles present some very interesting interfacial\nproperties that will be discussed in a forthcoming\npublication.\n\nThe sol stability and redispersability were further\nextended through the choice of the complexing\noligomer backbone. The hybrid metal oxide powder is\nalso re-dispersible in certain organic solvents like\nethanol, acetone or chloroform (not shown here) which\nis not the case for bare particles. These results may\neasily be extended to other nanoparticle systems. The\ncomplexation of nanoceria with end-functional PPEG to\ncreate true redispersible nanopowders in aqueous or\ncertain organic solvents provides the framework for\ndesigning a truly versatile hybrid metal oxide sol with\nclear utility in a range of applications.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nThe generation of robust and versatile phosphonatedPEG cerium oxide nanoparticles is highlighted through\na detailed series of complementary experiments. From\nquantitative light and neutron scattering data we are\nable to obtain the main features of the CeO2-PPEG\nhybrid core-shell nanostructure and to model the\nadsorption\nmechanism\n(NST\nmodel).\nThe\nmicrostructure is described in terms of molecular\nweight Mw, hydrodynamic diameter DH and number of\nadsorbed oligomers per particle Nads. The characteristic\nevolution of the Raleigh ratio as a function of the mixing\nratio is successfully described in term of non specific\nadsorption of oligomers onto nanoparticles. The NST\nmodel evidenced the presence of a critical ratio XP at\nwhich the particles are fully covered with an average\nnumber of chains Nads = 270. Beyond that threshold,\n8\n\n\for ionic strength (> 0.45 M) results in a reversible\naggregation of the particles, and destabilization of the\nsols leading eventually to a macroscopic phase\nseparation. Though the change in pH apparently\nreduces the effective surface charge of the particles, it\nalso reduces the range of the electrostatic repulsion.\nFor this system, the destabilization of the sols occurs\nwell below the point of zero charge of the ceria\nparticles, pzc = 7.9 28.

For the\noligomers and the nanoparticles in the dilute\nconcentration range (c < 1 wt. %), qRG << 1, equation\n(9) reduces to\n\noptical reflectometry40,41. Fixed angle reflectometry\nmeasures the reflectance at the Brewster angle on the\nflat substrate. A linearly polarized light beam is\nreflected by the surface and subsequently split into a\nparallel and a perpendicular component using a\npolarizing beam splitter. As material adsorbed at the\nsubstrate-solution interface, the intensity ratio S\nbetween the parallel and perpendicular components of\nthe reflected light is varied. The change in S is related\nto the adsorbed amount through:\n\n2\n\nR (c) = K M w,app c\n\n\u0002( t) =\n\n(10)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere S0 is the signal from the bare surface prior to\nadsorption. \u0001( c) is constructed by taking the plateau\n\nThis expression emphasizes the fact that for small\nsizes (< \u0001 /20), the Rayleigh ratio does not depend on\nthe wave-vector in the window 6\u000110-4 \u2013 4\u000110 -3 \u00c5-1,\ncharacteristic for light scattering.\n\nvalue \u0001Plateau of a given \u0001( t) curve at different\nconcentration c (c = 0.001 to 0.1 wt. %). A complete\ndescription of the stagnation point adsorption\nreflectometry device can be found in several\nreferences41-46.\n\nTo accurately determine the size of the colloidal\nspecies, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed\nwith concentration ranging from c = 0.01 wt. % \u2013 1 wt.\n%. In this range, the diffusion coefficient varies\naccording to: D(c) = D0(1 + D2c), where D0 is the selfdiffusion coefficient and D2 is a virial coefficient of the\nseries expansion. The sign of the virial coefficient, the\ntype of interactions between the aggregates, either\nrepulsive or attractive can be deduced. Here D2 is\npositive (+ 10-7 cm2*s -2), indicating a repulsive\ninterparticle interaction. From the value of D(c)\nextrapolated at c = 0 (noted D0), the hydrodynamic\nradius of the colloids is calculated according to the\nStokes-Einstein relation, DH = k BT 3\u0001\u0002SD0 , where kB is\nthe Boltzmann constant, T the temperature (T = 298 K)\nand \u0002S (\u0002S = 0.89\u000110-3 Pa.s) the solvent viscosity. The\nautocorrelation functions of the scattered light are\ninterpreted using both the method of cumulants and the\nCONTIN fitting procedure provided by the instrument\nsoftware.\n\nCeO2 model surfaces. A thin layer of polystyrene ~ 100\nnm\nis\ndeposited\non\ntop\nof\nan\nHMDS\n(hexamethyldisilizane) functionalized silicon wafer by\nspin-coating a toluene solution (25 g/l) at 5000 rpm47.\nThe surface is then dipped in a nanoceria solution (0.1\nwt. %) containing 0.1 M NaNO3 overnight. This results\nin the formation of a well packed nanoceria monolayer\non top of the PS surface as seen by AFM imaging (not\nshown here). Bare particle adsorption on plastic\nsurfaces will be described in a forthcoming publication.\nIt should be noted that the receding water contact angle\n\n\u0001r\n\non such model nanoceria surface was below 15o in\n\ncontrast with a\n\n\u0001r\n\n= 85 o for the original PS surface.\n\nSmall-Angle Neutron Scattering\nSmall-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) spectra are\nmeasured on PAXY spectrometer (Laboratoire Leon\nBrillouin-LLB, Saclay, France). Two configurations are\nused (D = 1.35 and 6.70 m, both at \u0001 = 6 \u00c5), covering a\nq-range from 5\u000210\u00013 \u00c5\u00011 to 0.2 \u00c5\u00011. Exposure times of 2\nh and 1 h for the small and large angle configuration\nrespectively are necessary to obtain a good statistics.\nRaw data are radially averaged. Standard corrections\nfor sample volume, neutron beam transmission, empty\ncell signal subtraction, and detector efficiency have\nbeen applied to get the scattered intensities in absolute\nscale using standard LLB software.\n\nUV-visible absorption spectrometry\nA UV-visible spectrometer (SmartSpecPlus from\nBioRad) is used to measure the absorbance of bare\nand coated nanoceria dispersion in water. The\nabsorbance is related to the nanoparticle concentration\nby the Beer-Lambert expression:\n\nAbs = \u0002 l cNP = \u0001logT\n\n1 S( t ) \u0001 S 0\nAs\nS0\n\n(11)\n\nwhere l ( = 1 cm), is the optical length of the cell, cNP\nthe nanoparticle concentration, \u0003 the molar absorption\ncoefficient (cm-1 \u03bcM-1), and T the transmission. In the\nfollowing, the nanoparticle concentration will be\nexpressed in wt. % or in \u03bcM of cerium oxide.\n\nOptical reflectometry\nThe adsorption isotherms \u0001( c) of PPEG oligomers\nonto a cerium oxide model surface is monitored using\n10\n\n\fnanoparticles with poly(acrylic acid): Toward stable\ndispersions.
