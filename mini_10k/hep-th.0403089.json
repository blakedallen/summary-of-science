Especially for the BTZ black hole [2], Strominger has shown that the correspondence (1.1)\nis \"precise\", from the knowledge of the asymptotic isometry group SO(2, 2), which generates\nthe two copies of the Virasoro algebra with the central charges [3, 4, 5]\n3l\n,\n2G\nand the Cardy's formula [6] for the density of states\nc\u0304 = c =\n\ns\n\ns\n\n \u0304 \u2212 c\u0304/24)\nc(\u2206 \u2212 c/24)\nc\u0304(\u2206\nln\u03c1 \u223c 2\u03c0\n+ 2\u03c0\n6\n6\n\n(1.2)\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhen the AdS3 vacuum, which corresponds to the mass eigenvalue of M = \u22121/8G, is chosen\n[7]: ZBTZ = Z\u2202(BTZ) \u223c exp{2\u03c0r+ /4G}. (r+ is the radius of the outer event horizon.) From\nthe frequent appearance of the BTZ black hole geometry in the many higher dimensional black\nholes in string theory, this result has been far reaching consequence in the higher dimensional\nAdS/CFT also [8].\nRecently, the generalization of the Strominger's result to the black holes coupled to a selfinteracting scalar field have been studied [9, 10, 11]. There it is found that the asymptotic\nsymmetry group and the algebra of the canonical generators remain the same as in pure gravity\neven though the fall-off of the fields at spatial infinity is slower than that of pure gravity such\nas the symmetry generators acquire non-trivial pieces from the scalar field. However, strangely,\nit is known that the statistical entropy from the Cardy's formula does not agree with the\nBekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy\n2\u03c0r+\n,\n(1.4)\n4G\nsuch as the usual AdS/CFT correspondence (1.1) is not favored; this has been first observed by\nNatsuume et al [9] and later by Henneaux et al [10] in a more general context; but no proper\nexplanation or resolution has been provided so far.\nIn this paper, I address this issue and I show that by a careful treatment of the vacuum\nstate in the canonical ensemble with a fixed temperature, which is the same as that of the BTZ\nblack hole without the scalar field, the BH entropy is exactly produced by the Cardy's formula.\nSBH =\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAsymptotic Symmetry of Three-Dimensional Gravity Coupled to\na Scalar Field\n\nIn this section I review the result of Ref.[10] on the asymptotic symmetry of three-dimensional\ngravity minimally coupled to a scalar field.

However, for a fixed temperature, apart\nfrom the above HMTZ black hole solution, the BTZ black hole can also be at equilibrium with\nthe heat bath.

This implies that there is a non-vanishing probability for the\ndecay of the HMTZ black hole into the BTZ black hole, induced by the thermal fluctuations:\nThe tunnelling amplitude is given by \u0393 \u2248 Ae\u2212\u2206IE [14] with some determinant A and the\ndifference between the Euclidean actions of the higher andrlower mass solutions at the same\n\nh\n\ntemperature \u2206IE = IE [\u1e21 BTZ ] \u2212 I[\u1e21 HMTZ] = \u03c0l 1 \u2212\nclassical solution of the Einstein equation.\n\n4\n\n3(1+\u03bd)\n\u03982\u03bd\n\ni\n\nM HMTZ \u03982\u03bd\n6G(1+\u03bd)\n\n> 0, where \u1e21 is the\n\nStatistical Entropy\n\nOnce one has the Virasoro algebra of (2.5), one can compute its statistical entropy S = ln\u03c1\nfor the density of states \u03c1 as follows [6, 15, 16]\ns\n\n \u0304 eff\nceff \u2206eff\nc\u0304eff \u2206\n+ 2\u03c0\n,\nS = 2\u03c0\n6\n6\ns\n\n5\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fwhere\nceff = c \u2212 24\u2206min , \u2206eff = \u2206 \u2212 c/24,\n \u0304 min , \u2206\n \u0304 eff = \u2206\n \u0304 \u2212 c\u0304/24 ,\nc\u0304eff = c\u0304 \u2212 24\u2206\n\n(4.2)\n\n \u0304 min ) is the minimum of L0 (L\u03040 ) eigenvalue \u2206(\u2206);\n \u0304 for \u2206min = \u2206\n \u0304 min = 0 this reduces\nand \u2206min (\u2206\nto the formula (1.3), which is the case for the BTZ black hole.

For 0 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 1 some abnormal phenomena happen: Another horizon r++ which looks like\na cosmological horizon appears outside the horizon r+ ; It is created at infinity for \u03bd = 0; as \u03bd\n3\n\nThere are some debates on this though. See for example [18, 19, 20, 21].\n\n6\n\n\fincreases from 0, it approaches to r+ until meets r+ for \u03bd = 1; r++ is located inside of r+ for\n\u03bd > 1 such as it behaves as an inner horizon. So, for 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1 the canonical ensemble with an\nequilibrium temperature does not exist, due to the different Hawking temperatures for the two\nhorizons, unless they meet at \u03bd = 1. Therefore, for 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 1 the black hole decay process in\nsection 3 and the entropy computation in the section 4 do not apply.\n2. Even though I obtained the BH entropy (3.9) precisely, by assuming (3.12) for the vacua\nBTZ\nHMTZ\nwith the negative mass eigenvalues Mmin\n= \u22121/8G and Mmin\n= \u2212\u03982\u03bd /24G(1 + \u03bd), the very\nHMTZ\nBTZ\nmeaning of (3.11) for the negative masses, where r+\nand r+\nare pure-imaginary, is not\nquite clear. But from the exact agreement with the BH entropy, the assumed formula (3.12)\nmust have some meaning. A possible explanation of this is to consider the black hole decay\nHMTZ\nthrough the process 'HMT Z \u2192 BT Z \u2192 BT Z vacuum' and the proper value of Mmin\n, which\nmight not be an apparently acceptable state, may be extrapolated by the analytic continuation\nof (3.12) due to some reasons, such as (3.12) might have more general meaning than (3.11).\n3. The Riemann tensor of the HMTZ metric (3.5) is singular at the origin as can be shown\nby computing the curvature invariant\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\ns\n\n213 l(GM)5/2\n\u221a\n+ O(r \u22124)\n5\n3 \u03bd + 1r\n\n(5.1)\n\nnear the origin. For M > 0, \u03bd > \u22121 this singularity is hidden inside the event horizon r+ . But,\nin contrast to the BTZ black hole, the particle states with M < 0 have the naked curvature\nsingularity at the origin; even more, (5.1), as well as the metric (3.5), becomes imaginary as\nM grows negative. Moreover, one can easily check that there is no conical singularity at the\norigin regardless of the sign of M.\nSo, there are some qualitative differences between the AdS3 vacuum of the BTZ black hole\nand the vacuum (4.5) of the HMTZ black hole: In contrast to the former, the latter has the\nnaked curvatures singularity as well as the complex metric and scalar field. The complexvaluedness might not be a problem if one assume the decay into the AdS3 vacuum 4 . However,\nit is unclear whether all the massive HMTZ black holes decay into their corresponding BTZ\nblack holes with the masses given by the relation (3.12) before reaching the particle states with\nM < 0, or there are some remnant transient states such as one of them decays into the AdS3\nvacuum.\n4. The potential V\u03bd (\u03c6) of (3.1) is unbounded below for \u03bd > \u22121, such as the weak energy\ncondition (WEC) is violated for outside the horizon, and the scalar field excitation around\n\u03c6 = 0 becomes \"tachyonic\" with the mass-squared m2 = \u22123/4l2 . So, the HMTZ black hole\n4\n\nThis is not forbidden in principle since both vacua satisfy the classical Einstein equation, which is required\nin identifying the transition amplitude \u0393, due to the absence of the conical singularities. But, in contrast to\nM > 0 case, the tunnelling probability becomes |\u0393|2 \u2248 |A|2 due to the imaginary valuedness of \u2206IE .\n\n7\n\n\fdeparts importantly from the assumptions of the \"no-scalar-hair\" theorems [22, 23]; departs\nfrom the old theorems [22] due to violation of \u03c6dV\u03bd (\u03c6)/d\u03c6 \u2265 0 and also due to the non-vanishing\nsurface integral at infinity, from the slower fall-off (2.2); and departs from the new theorem\n[23] due to violation of the W EC. 5 However, the decay of the HMTZ into the BTZ realizes\ndynamically the no-scalar-hair theorems.\n5. V\u03bd (\u03c6) satisfies the stability bound m2 \u2265 \u22121/l2 for the perturbations \"on\" AdS3 [25]. 6\nBut this does not necessarily guarantees the stability of the HMTZ solution since this solution\nis not \"globally\" AdS3 : It is already known, due to Mart\u00ednez, that \u03bd = 0 solution is unstable\nunder linear perturbations of the metric [26]; I suspect that \u03bd > 0 solutions would be also\nunstable since this is \"more\" tachyonic than the \u03bd = 0 solution, which is unstable already;\n\u22121 < \u03bd < 0 solutions \"might\" be stable though it is still tachyonic; an explicit computation on\nthis stability under linear perturbations would be certainly interesting.\n6. There is the mirror black hole solution with M\u0303 = \u2212M, 1 + \u03bd\u0303 = \u2212(1 + \u03bd) < 0 (\u03bd\u0303 = \u03bd = \u22121\nsolution corresponds to the massless black holes) with the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd and the scalar field\n\u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 [B\u0303 = B, H\u0303 = H, \u0398\u03bd\u0303 = \u0398, r\u0303+ = r+ , T\u0303 = T ] for\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n6\n6\n\u03c6\u0303\n= V\u03bd (\u03c6),\n\u03c6\u0303\n\u2212\n(\u03bd\u0303\n+\n2)\nsinh\ncosh\n8l2\n!\n3B\u0303 2 2B\u0303 3\nH\u0303 2\n+\n= F;\nF\u0303 = 2 + (1 + \u03bd\u0303)\nl\nl2\nl2 H\u0303\n\n\u1e7c\u03bd\u0303 (\u03c6\u0303) = \u2212\n\n(5.2)\n(5.3)\n\none can not distinguish this with the HMTZ black hole except for M\u0303 < 0, \u03bd\u0303 < \u22121. The role of\nthis mirror solution to the vacuum decay into the AdS3 vacuum is not clear.\n7. The higher order corrections in the bulk, due to the thermal fluctuations of black hole\ngeometry\u2013fluctuations of the metric\u2013 to the BH entropy is given by, following [27],\n\uf8ee\n\n3 4\n\n3\n1\n\u03c0 l (\u03b4E)\nS = SBH \u2212 lnSBH + ln \uf8f0\n2\n2\n2G2\n\n2\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n3(1 + \u03bd) \uf8fb\n\n\u03982\u03bd\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nOn the other hand, the corresponding correction to statistical entropy a\u2032 la Strominger is given\nby\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\u0398\u03bd\n64\u03c0 3 l2\n\uf8fb .\nq\nS = SBH \u2212 3 lnSBH + ln \uf8f0\n2\n(8G)\n3(1 + \u03bd)\n\n(5.5)\n\nThis result shows the factor of 2 disagreement with the bulk result (5.4) as in the BTZ black\nhole without a scalar field [27, 28].
