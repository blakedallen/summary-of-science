Galaxies: active \u2013 Galaxies: nuclei \u2013 X-rays: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nAmong the basic properties characterizing an Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) the flux variability, especially at X-rays, is\none of the most common. Previous multi-wavelength variability studies (e.g., Edelson et al. 1996; Nandra et al. 1998) have\nshown that AGN are variable in every observable wave band,\nbut the X-ray flux exhibits variability of larger amplitude and\non time scales shorter than any other energy band, indicating\nthat the X-ray emission originates in the innermost regions of\nthe central engine.\nHowever, even though the discovery of X-ray variability\ndates back more than two decades, its origin is still poorly\nunderstood. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that the\nvariability properties of AGN are an important means of probing the physical conditions in their emission regions. The reason is that using energy spectra alone it is often impossible to\ndiscriminate between competing physical models and thus the\ncomplementary information obtained from the temporal analysis is crucial to break the spectral degeneracy.\nOver the years, several variability models have been proposed, involving one or a combination of the fundamental components of an AGN: accretion disk, corona, and relativistic jet.\nThese models can be divided into two main categories: 1) intrinsically linear models, as the shot noise model (e.g., Terrel\n1972), where the light curve is the result of the superposition of\nSend offprint requests to: mario@physics.gmu.edu\n\nsimilar shots or flares produced by many independent active regions, and 2) non-linear models, which require some coupling\nbetween emitting regions triggering avalanche effects, as the\nself-organized criticality model (e.g., Mineshige et al.1994),\nor models assuming that the variability is caused by variations in the accretion rate propagating inwards (e.g. Lyubarskii\n1997). The \"rms-flux relation\" recently discovered by Uttley &\nMcHardy (2001), along with detection of non-linearity in different AGN light curves (i.e., in 3C 345 by Vio et al. 1992; in\n3C 390.3 by Leighly & O'Brien 1997; in NGC 4051 by Green\net al. 1999; in Ark 564 by Gliozzi et al. 2002), favors non-linear\nvariability models, but there is no general consensus on the nature of the X-ray variability yet.\nBecause of their brightness, the temporal and spectral properties of Galactic black holes (GBHs) are much better known\nand can be used to infer information on their more powerful,\nextragalactic analogues, the AGN. For example, it is well established that GBHs undergo state transitions (see McClintock &\nRemillard 2003 for a recent review), switching between \"low\"\nand \"high\" states, which are both unambiguously characterized\nby a specific combination of energy spectrum and power spectral density (PSD).\nEarly AGN PSD studies based on EXOSAT data (e.g.,\nLawrence & Papadakis 1993; Green et al. 1993) revealed a\nred-noise variability (i.e., a PSD described by a power law),\nsimilar to the one observed in GBHs, which in addition show\nbreaks in their PSD (i.e., departure from the power law) at\n\n\f2\n\nM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\nspecific frequencies depending on the spectral state. Recently,\npower-spectral analysis of high-quality light curves of a few\nAGN (obtained with RXTE and XMM-Newton e.g., Uttley, et\nal. 2002; Markowitz et al. 2003; McHardy et al. 2004) has\nled to the first unambiguous detection of \"frequency breaks\"\nin their power spectra, strengthening the similarity between the\nAGN and GBH PSDs. This similarity lends further support to\nthe hypothesis that the same physical process is at work in AGN\nand GBHs, regardless of the black hole mass.\nAlmost all methods employed in timing analysis (e.g.,\npower spectrum, structure function, auto-correlation analysis)\nrequire some kind of stationarity. Generally speaking, a system is considered stationary, if the average statistical properties of the time series are constant with time. More specifically,\nthe stationarity is defined as \"strong\" if all the moments of\nthe probability distribution function are constant, and \"weak\"\nif only the moments up to the second order (i.e., mean and\nvariance) are constant. Usually, non-stationarity is considered\nan undesired complication. However, in some cases the nonstationarity provides the most interesting information, as in the\ncase of GBHs switching from a spectral state to another.\nCompared to their scaled-down counterparts, the GBHs,\nthe study of non-stationarity in AGN is complicated by the\nfact that their flux variability is characterized by much longer\ntime-scales. This might be the reason why \"different\" states\nhave not been observed yet in AGN, even though a correspondence between GBH spectral states and some AGN classes\n(namely, between Seyfert 1 galaxies and the GBH low state,\nand between Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and the GBH high\nstate, respectively) has been hypothesized. Nonetheless, several\nmonitoring campaigns carried out by RXTE in the last decade\nhave produced archival data sets suitable for searching for nonstationarity in the AGN light curves. Such a detection of nonstationarity would suggest transitions of the source between\ndifferent states.\nWe use data from a two-year intensive RXTE monitoring\ncampaign of the broad-line radio galaxy (BLRG) 3C 390.3 to\nsearch for evidence of non-stationarity. Previous X-rays studies with ROSAT, and RXTE (Leighly & O'Brien 1997, Gliozzi\net al. 2003) demonstrated that 3C 390.3 is one of the most\nvariable AGN on time scales of days and months. In addition,\nthe ROSAT HRI monitoring campaign has shown evidence for\nnon-linearity and possibly non-stationarity (Leighly & O'Brien\n1997). In order to exploit all the information contained in the\ntime series, we employ a number of complementary methods.\nSpecifically, we investigate the stationarity in 3C 390.3 not only\nwith traditional linear techniques as the PSD in the Fourier domain, and the structure function (SF) and auto-correlation function (ACF) in the time domain, but also in pseudo-phase space,\nwith techniques borrowed from nonlinear dynamics, and finally\nwe probe directly the probability density function (PDF) associated with the physical processes underlying the signal.\n\n2. Observations and Data Reduction\nWe use archival RXTE data (PI: Leighly) of 3C 390.3. This\nsource was observed by RXTE for two consecutive monitoring\ncampaigns between 1999 and 2001. The first set of observa-\n\ntions was carried out from 1999 January 8 to 2000 February\n29, and the second one from 2000 March 3 to 2001 February\n23. Both campaigns were performed with similar sampling:\n3C 390.3 was regularly observed for \u223c 1000\u20132000 s once every three days. The observations were carried out with the\nProportional Counter Array (PCA; Jahoda et al. 1996), and the\nHigh-Energy X-Ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE; Rotschild\net al. 1998) on RXTE. Here we will consider only PCA data,\nbecause the signal-to-noise of the HEXTE data is too low for a\nmeaningful timing analysis.\nThe PCA data were screened according to the following\nacceptance criteria: the satellite was out of the South Atlantic\nAnomaly (SAA) for at least 30 minutes, the Earth elevation angle was \u2265 10\u25e6 , the offset from the nominal optical position was\n\u2264 0\u25e6.02, and the parameter ELECTRON-0 was \u2264 0.1. The last\ncriterion removes data with high particle background rates in\nthe Proportional Counter Units (PCUs). The PCA background\nspectra and light curves were determined using the L7 \u2212 240\nmodel developed at the RXTE Guest Observer Facility (GOF)\nand implemented by the program pcabackest v.2.1b. Since\nthe two monitoring campaigns span three different gain epochs,\nthe appropriate files provided by the RXTE Guest Observer\nFacility (GOF), were used to calculate the background light\ncurves. This model is appropriate for \"faint\" sources, i.e., those\nproducing count rates less than 40 s\u22121 PCU\u22121 . All the above\ntasks were carried out using the FTOOLS v.5.1 software package and with the help of the rex script provided by the RXTE\nGOF, which also produces response matrices and effective\narea curves appropriate for the time of the observation. Data\nwere initially extracted with 16 s time resolution and subsequently re-binned at different bin widths depending on the application. The current temporal analysis is restricted to PCA,\nSTANDARD-2 mode, 2\u201320 keV, Layer 1 data, because that\nis where the PCA is best calibrated and most sensitive. Since\nPCUs 1, 3, and 4 were frequently turned off (the average number of PCUs is 2.25 and 1.95 in the 1999 and 2000 observations, respectively), only data from the other two PCUs (0 and\n2) were used. All quoted count rates are for two PCUs.\nThe spectral analysis of PCA data was performed using the\nXSPEC v.11 software package (Arnaud 1996). We used PCA\nresponse matrices and effective area curves created specifically\nfor the individual observations by the program pcarsp, taking\ninto account the evolution of the detector properties. All the\nspectra were rebinned so that each bin contained enough counts\nfor the \u03c72 statistic to be valid. Fits were performed in the energy\nrange 4\u201320 keV, where the signal-to-noise ratio is the highest.\n\n3. The X-ray Light Curve\nFigure 1 shows the background-subtracted 2\u201320 keV count\nrate and hardness ratio (7\u201320 keV/2\u20135 keV) light curves of\n3C 390.3. Filled circles represent data points from the first\nmonitoring campaign, whereas open diamonds are used for the\nsecond campaign. A visual inspection of the light curve suggests the existence of different variability patterns during the\ntwo monitoring campaigns. In the first one, 3C 390.3 exhibits\nan initial smooth decrease in the count rate (a factor \u223c2 in 100\ndays) followed by an almost steady increase (a factor \u223c3.5 in\n\n\fM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. X-ray light curves of the background-subtracted count rate in the 2\u201320 keV band (top panel) and of the X-ray color 7\u201320\nkeV/2\u20135 keV (bottom panel) from RXTE PCA observations of 3C 390.3. Time bins are 5760s (\u223c 1 RXTE orbit). Filled circles\nrepresent data points from the first monitoring campaign from 1999 January 8 to 2000 February 29, whereas open diamonds are\ndata points from the second monitoring campaign from 2000 March 3 to 2001 February 23. The dashed lines in the top panel\nindicate the intervals used for the time-resolved spectral analysis (see \u00a79).\n100 days). After day \u223c 200 (from the beginning of the observation), the source shows significant, low-amplitude, fast variations. During the second monitoring campaign, the source does\nnot show any long-term, smooth change in count rate, but only\na flickering behavior with two prominent flares. This qualitative difference is supported by the difference of the two mean\ncount rates averaged over each campaign, 6.4 \u00b1 0.2\u221as\u22121 and\n9.0 \u00b1 0.1 s\u22121 respectively, where the uncertainties, \u03c3/ n, were\ncalculated assuming that the data distribution is normal and the\ndata are a collection of independent measurements. However,\nthe data points of AGN light curves are not independent but\ncorrelated and thus the apparent difference between the mean\ncount rates could simply result from the red-noise nature of the\nvariability process, combined with its randomness.\nAny AGN light curve is just one of the possible realizations of an underlying physical process, which can be linear\nstochastic, non-linear stochastic, chaotic, or a combination of\nthe three possibilities. The distinction between stochastic and\nchaotic processes is that the former are random, whereas the\nlatter are deterministic. A further difference is that chaotic processes are intrinsically non-linear, while stochastic processes\ncan be either linear or non-linear (in a mathematical sense linearity means that the value of the time series at a given time\ncan be written as a linear combination of the values at previous times plus some random variable). As a consequence, light\ncurves produced by the same process may appear different, but\nthe average statistical properties should in principle be con-\n\nstant, provided that the system is actually stationary, and the\nlight curves are longer than the characteristic time scale of the\nsystem. This indicates that only average statistical properties\ncan provide information on the physics underlying a variability\nprocess, whereas instantaneous properties (such as the visual\nappearance of the light curves) may be misleading. With this in\nmind, we carry out a number of tests for stationarity, which we\ndescribe in detail in the next section.\n\n4. Stationarity Tests\nIn previous temporal studies of AGN, no strong evidence for\nnon-stationarity has been reported. Indeed, AGN light curves\nare considered to be \"second-order\" stationary, due to their\nred noise variability. However, the absence of non-stationarity\nmight be partly due to the fact that previous works were based\nonly on a PSD analysis, which may not be the most appropriate\nmethod to detect non-stationarity in some cases, as we demonstrate below.\nHere, we adopt several complementary methods to investigate the issue of the stationarity in the 3C 390.3 light curve.\nFirst, we utilize the scaling index method, a technique borrowed from non-linear dynamics, useful for discriminating between time series. Secondly, the temporal properties are studied\nfirst with traditional linear techniques in the Fourier domain, by\nestimating the PSD, and in the time domain with structure function and auto-correlation function analyses. Finally, we probe\n\n\f4\n\nM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\ndirectly the probability density function associated with the\nphysical process underlying the signal. We demonstrate that all\nmethods, with the exception of the PSD, point very strongly to\nnon-stationarity.\n\n4.1. Non-linear Analysis: Scaling Index Method\nNon-linear methods are rarely employed in the analysis of\nAGN light curves, partly because these methods are less developed than the linear ones, partly because it is implicitly assumed that AGN light curves are linear and stochastic.\nHowever, non-linear methods can be useful not only to characterize the nature of chaotic deterministic systems, but also to\ndiscriminate between two time series, regardless of the fact that\nthey are linear or non-linear.\nThe scaling index method (e.g., Atmanspacher et al. 1989)\nis employed in a number of different fields because of its ability\nto discern underlying structure in noisy data. It was applied to\nAGN time series by Gliozzi et al. (2002) to show that the low\nand high states of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564,\nindistinguishable on the basis of linear methods, are actually\nintrinsically different. A detailed description of the method is\ngiven in Gliozzi et al. (2002) and references therein; here we\nsummarize its basic characteristics.\nWhen methods of nonlinear dynamics are applied to time\nseries analysis, the concept of phase space reconstruction represents the basis for most of the analysis tools. In fact, for\nstudying chaotic deterministic systems it is important to establish a vector space (the phase space) such that specifying\na point in this space specifies a state of the system, and vice\nversa. However, in order to apply the concept of phase space to\na time series, which is a scalar sequence of measurements, one\nhas to convert it into a set of state vectors.\nFor example, starting from a time series, one can construct a\nset of 2(3, 4, ...)-dimensional vectors by selecting pairs (triplets,\nquadruplets, ...) of data points, whose count rate values represent the values of the different components of each vector. The\ndata points defining the vector components are chosen such that\nthe second point is separated from the first by a time delay \u2206t,\nwhile the second is separated from the first by 2\u2206t, and so on.\nThis process, called time-delay reconstruction, can be easily\ngeneralized to any n-dimensional vector. In non-linear dynamics, where this technique is used to determine fractal dimensions and discriminate chaos from stochasticity, the choice of\nthe time delay is not arbitrary, but should satisfy specific rules\n(see Kantz & Schreiber 1997 for a review). In our case, however, this technique is used only to discriminate between two\nstates of the system (determining any kind of dimension would\nbe meaningless for non-deterministic systems). Thus the only\nrequirement here is that the results are statistically significant.\nNonetheless, we have used different values for \u2206t, and verified\nthat the results do not critically depend upon the choice of the\ntime delay.\nThe set of n-dimensional vectors, derived from the original light curve, are then mapped (or embedded) into an ndimensional vector space, producing a phase space portrait,\n\nFig. 2. Scaling index distributions of 3C 390.3 during the 1999\n(dashed line) and 2000 (solid line) monitoring campaign.\nwhose topological properties represent the temporal properties\nof the corresponding time series.\nIn order to quantify the difference between two phase space\nportraits, a suitable quantity is the correlation integral C(R)\n(Grassberger & Procaccia 1983), which basically counts the\nnumber of pairs of points with distances smaller than R. An\nexhaustive description of the correlation integral method and\nits application to X\u2013ray light curves of AGN is given by Lehto\net al (1993).\nThe scaling index method, which is based on the local estimate of the correlation integral for each point in the phase\nspace, characterizes quantitatively the data point distribution by\nestimating the \"crowding\" of the data around each data point.\nMore specifically, for each of the N points, the cumulative number function is calculated\nNi (R) = n{ j|di j \u2264 R},\n\n(1)\n\nIn other words, Ni (R) measures the number of points j,\nwhose distance di j from a point i is smaller than R. The function Ni (R), in a given range of radii (which are related to the\ntypical distances between the data points, that, in turn, depend\non the choice of the embedding space dimension), can be approximated by a power law Ni (R) \u223c R\u03b1i , where \u03b1i is the scaling\nindex. Explicitly, the scaling index for each point i is obtained\nby calculating the cumulative number function Ni (R) at two different radii, R1 and R2 , and by computing the logarithmic slope:\n\u03b1i =\n\nlog Ni (R1 ) \u2212 log Ni (R2 )\n.\n(log R1 \u2212 log R2 )\n\n(2)\n\nNote that for a purely random process the average scaling index\nh\u03b1i tends to the value of the dimension of the embedding space,\nwhereas for correlated processes and for deterministic (chaotic)\n\n\fM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\nprocesses the value of h\u03b1i is always smaller than the dimension\nof the embedding space and independent of that dimension.\n\n0.5\n\nWe have calculated the scaling index for all the points of\nthe two phase space portraits derived from the two monitoring campaigns, using embedding spaces of dimensions ranging between 3 and 10. There are no systematic prescriptions\nfor the choice of the embedding dimension. The discriminating\npower of the statistic based on the scaling index is enhanced using high embedding dimensions (this can be understood in the\nfollowing way: if the data are embedded in a low-dimension\nphase-space many of them will fall on the same position, losing in this way part of the information). On the other hand,\nthe choice of too high embedding dimensions would reduce\nthe number of points in the pseudo phase-space, lowering the\nstatistical significance of the test. In all cases a significant difference from the two light curves was found. The resulting histograms for a 5-dimensional phase space are plotted in Fig 2:\nthe dashed line represents data from the first monitoring campaign, whereas the continuous line indicates points from the\nsecond monitoring campaign.\n\n0\n\nThere is a remarkable difference between the two distributions, both in shape and location of the centroid. For this kind\nof analysis the most important quantity is the location of the\ncentroid of the histogram, which is related to the correlation\ndimension. Such a difference cannot be ascribed to the difference in mean count rates showed during the two monitoring\ncampaigns. In fact, the scaling index analysis is sensitive only\nto the relative positions of the data points within a distribution,\nnot to their absolute positions in the phase space. This has been\nverified applying the scaling index analysis to randomized light\ncurves, which were obtained by randomizing the temporal positions of the data points of each light curve. In this way, the\nstatistical properties (i.e., the mean, variance, and the statistical moments of higher order) of the light curves are unchanged,\nwhereas the timing structure is destroyed. As expected, the centroids of the histograms of the randomized distributions have\nlarger values and are nearly indistinguishable.\nWe conclude that, the intrinsic, timing properties of the\n1999 light curve are significantly different from the properties\nof the 2000 light curve. This result suggests that the X-ray emitting process in 3C 390.3 is non stationary.\n\n4.2. Analysis in the Fourier Domain: Power Spectral\nDensity\nWe followed the method of Papadakis & Lawrence (1993) to\ncompute the power spectrum of the 1999 and 2000 light curves,\nafter normalizing them to their mean. We used a 3-day binning (i.e., equal to the typical sampling rate of the source) for\nboth light curves. As a result, the light curves that we used are\nevenly sampled, but there are a few missing points in them; 30\nout of 140 and 15 out of 120 for the 1999 and 2000 light curves,\nrespectively. These points are randomly distributed over the\nwhole light curve, and we accounted for them using linear interpolation between the two bins adjacent to the gaps, adding\nappropriate Poisson noise.\n\n5\n\n-1\n\nLog Normalized Power (Hz )\n\n1999\n-0.5\n\n2000\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n\n-2\n\n-2.5\n\n-3\n-8\n\n-7.5\n\n-7\n\n-6.5\n\n-6\n\n-5.5\n\nLog.

The\nsolid and dashed lines show the best fitting power law models,\nincluding the effects of the experimental Poisson noise level.\nFigure 3 shows the PSD of the 1999 and 2000 light curves\n(filled circles, and open diamonds, respectively). Each point in\nthe estimated PSD represents the average of 10 logarithmic periodogram estimates. Both PSDs follow a power-law like form,\nwith no obvious frequency breaks. We fitted both spectra with\na simple power law. The model provides a good description of\nboth PSDs. The best fitting slope values are consistent within\nthe errors with the value of \u22122 \u00b1 0.3 in both cases. The best\nfitting power law models are also shown in Fig 3 (solid and\ndashed lines, for the 2000 and 1999 PSDs, respectively).\nA closer look at the PSD plot (Fig. 3) indicates a possible low frequency flattening of the 2000 PSD between log(\u03bd) =\n\u22126.5 and \u22127, corresponding to a time interval between \u223c35 and\n115 days. In order to investigate this issue further we split the\ntwo lowest frequency points into two (to increase the frequency\nresolution) and refitted the 2000 PSD with a broken power law\nmodel. We kept the slope below and above the frequency break\nfixed to the values \u22121 and \u22122, respectively, and kept as free\nparameters the break frequency and normalization of the PSD.\nThe model provides a good fit to the 2000 PSD, but statistically\nnot better than a simple power law according to an F-test. The\nbest fitting break frequency is 2.5\u00d710\u22127 Hz, which corresponds\nto a break time scale of \u223c 46 days. The 90%-confidence lower\nlimit to this time scale is 33 days, while, due to the limited coverage of the observed PSD at lower frequencies, the upper limit\nis effectively equal to the length of the 2000 light curve (i.e.\n\u223c 300 days). We also tried to fit the 1999 PSD with this model,\nbut without success: the best fitting break frequency turned out\nto be lower than the lowest frequency sampled by the 1999 light\n\n\f6\n\nM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\ncurve, indicating that there is no indication of any breaks in the\n1999 PSD. This power spectrum follows a \u22122 power law shape\ndown to the lowest sampled frequencies.\nIn order to quantify the comparison between the 1999 and\n2000 PSDs in a statistical way, we used the \"S\" statistic as defined by Papadakis & Lawrence (1995). To avoid the constant\nPoisson noise level, we considered the periodogram estimates\nup to frequencies \u223c 7 \u00d7 10\u22127 Hz. We find that S = \u22121.3, which\nimplies that the two light curves are not far away from the hypothesis of stationarity. Therefore, the differences suggested in\nthe previous paragraph by the broken power-law model fitting\nresults are not confirmed by this more rigorous statistical test.\nLight curves with denser sampling, which would result in a\nmuch higher frequency resolution at lower frequencies (where\nthe potential differences between the two PSDs are observed),\nwould be necessary for a more sensitive comparison between\nthe 1999 and 2000 power spectra.\nTo extend the power spectrum estimation to lower frequencies, and increase the frequency resolution, we then estimated the power spectrum of the combined 1999 and 2000\nlight curves. This combined PSD does not show any frequency\nbreak either. It is well fitted by a power law function, with a\nslope of \u223c \u22122. This result is consistent with recent results from\nthe power spectrum analysis of combined XMM-Newton and\nRXTE light curves of radio-quiet AGN (Markowitz et al., 2003;\nMcHardy et al. 2004). According to those results, the 2 \u2212 10\nkeV power spectrum of AGN follows a \u22122 power law form\ndown to a \"break\" frequency, below which it flattens to a slope\nof \u22121. This break time scale appears to scale with the black\nhole mass according to the relation: tbr (days) = MBH /106.5 M\u2299\n(Markowitz et al. 2003). Using the reverberation mapping technique, Peterson et al. (2004) estimate the black hole mass of\n3C 390.3 to be MBH \u223c 2.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . In this case, the characteristic break time scale of 3C 390.3 should be \u223c 95 days, which\ncorresponds to a break frequency of \u223c 10\u22127 Hz. This break frequency is entirely consistent with the broken power law model\nfitting results in the case of the 2000 light curve. Unfortunately,\nthough, even the combined 1999 and 2000 PSD does not extend\nto frequencies low enough for this break frequency to be firmly\ndetected. Longer and/or denser monitoring observations of this\nsource are needed for the detection of this PSD feature. It is\nworth noticing that the value assumed for the mass of the black\nhole harbored by 3C 390.3 is still a matter of debate. The value\nused in this work is the most recent and it is consistent within\nthe errors with the mass estimate given by Kaspi et al. (2000).\nHowever, based on another reverberation mapping experiment\non this source, Sergeev et al. (2002) find a longer reverberation\nlag and determine a higher mass of 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 using a different\nmethod. In that case, the putative break frequency in the PSD\nwould be located at a frequency of \u223c 1/yr, which could not be\nprobed with the current data set.\nWe conclude that the average, 2 \u2212 20 keV PSD of 3C 390.3\nfollows a power-law of the form form P( f ) \u221d f \u22122 at all sampled time scales from 3\u22121 \u2212100\u22121 days\u22121 , although the presence\nof a break cannot be excluded for the 2000 PSD. The 1999 and\n2000 PSDs are statistically consistent with each other, suggesting that the X-ray emitting process of the source is \"weakly\"\n(i.e., second-order) stationary.\n\nFig. 4. Structure function of 3C 390.3 during the 1999 (top\npanel) and 2000 (bottom panel) monitoring campaign. Time\nbins are 3 days.\n\n4.3. Analysis in the Time Domain: Structure Function\nAccording to the results from the Fourier analysis presented in\nSection 4.2, the \"similarity\" between the 1999 and 2000 PSDs\nsuggests that the auto-correlation function does not change\nwith time, i.e., the process is second-order stationary. On the\nother hand, the scaling index method results suggest significant\ndifferences in the statistical properties of the 1999 and 2000\nlight curves, i.e., the X-ray light curves of 3C 390.3 are nonstationary. Although this method shows clearly that the two\nlight curves are intrinsically different, it does not identify what\nthese differences are. This apparent difference can be explained\nin different ways: (a) the non-stationarity is related to variations\nof higher moments than those of second order, (b) the nonstationarity is related to the non-linear nature of the 3C 390.3\nvariability (see Leighly & O'Brien 1997) and linear methods,\nsuch as the PSD, are unable to detect it, or (c) the PSD is not\nsensitive enough, due to its intrinsic noise, which requires an\naverage over many data segments, reducing the length of the\ntime interval probed.\nIn order to verify whether the X-ray light curve of 3C 390.3\nis indeed second-order stationary, we performed an analysis\nbased on the structure function (e.g., Simonetti 1985), a linear method which works in the time domain and has the ability\nto discern the range of time scales that contribute to the variations in the data set. In principle, the SF should provide the\nsame information as the PSD, as both functions are related to\n\n\fM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\nthe auto-covariance function of the process R(\u03c4). The power\nspectrum is defined as the Fourier transform of R(\u03c4), while the\nintrinsic SF at lag \u03c4 is equal to 2\u03c32 \u2212 R(\u03c4), where \u03c32 is the\nvariance of the process (Simonetti et al., 1985). In fact, if the\nPSD follows a power law of the form P( f ) \u221d f \u2212a (where f is\nthe frequency), then SF \u221d \u03c4a\u22121 (Bregman et al., 1990).\nWe computed the structure functions for the first and second monitoring campaigns. The results are plotted in Fig 4: the\ntop panel (filled circles) refers to the 1999 light curve, whereas\nthe bottom panel (open diamonds) describes the 2000 SF. Both\nSFs have a power law shape of the form SF \u221d \u03c41 , which is consistent with the results of the PSD analysis, since P( f ) \u221d f \u22122\n(see \u00a74.2). Furthermore, the 2000 SF shows a flattening to SF\n\u221d \u03c40 , at a characteristic time lag of \u223c 4 \u2212 8 \u00d7 106 s, followed\nby an oscillating behavior. This value corresponds to a characteristic time scale of \u223c 50 \u2212 200 days, which corresponds\napproximately to the value expected on the basis of the black\nhole mass estimate (see discussion on \u00a73.1). The SF flattening\ncannot be attributed to the sampling pattern of the 2000 light\ncurve for the following reasons: 1) the 2000 SF is quite similar to the one derived by Leighly & O'Brien (1997) based on\na long monitoring campaign carried out by the ROSAT HRI,\nwith different duration and sampling; 2) the 2000 SF is indistinguishable from the one derived using evenly sampled data,\nobtained by interpolating linearly the 2000 light curve and removing any gap. In contrast with the 2000 SF, the 1999 SF\ndoes not show a slope flattening at a similar time lag (the flattening at the highest time lags, around 2 \u00d7 107 s, is expected; it\nis a property of the SF to approach a value of \u223c 2 \u00d7 \u03c32 at the\nlongest time lags).\nThe 1999 and 2000 SFs look qualitatively different.\nHowever, the statistical significance of this difference cannot\nbe assessed directly, since the the SF points are correlated and\ntheir true uncertainty is unknown. The errors shown in Fig. 4\nare representative of the typical spread of the points around\ntheir mean in each time-lag bin, hence they depend mainly on\nthe the number of points that contribute to the SFs estimation at\neach time lag. To investigate in a quantitative way whether the\ndifference between the two SFs can be simply ascribed to the\nintrinsic, red-noise randomness of the light curves or it actually reveals a non-stationary behavior, the use of Monte Carlo\nsimulations is necessary.\nOne possible way of assessing the significance of the apparent differences between the 1999 and 2000 SFs, is to perform a model-independent Monte Carlo experiment. To this\nend, we adopted the method used to assess the significance of\nthe observed delays in the cross-correlation functions of two simultaneous light curves (Peterson et al. 1998). This method is\nbased on the \"bootstrap\" technique (Press et al. 1992). Starting\nfrom our two observed light curves, we created two sets of\n104 synthetic light curves, by adding a random offset to each\npoint consistent with its error bar and then choosing points randomly from the light curve but with the correct temporal order.\nTypically, a synthetic light curve is similar by construction to\nthe original one, but contains 30% less data points. Considering\nthe synthetic light curves as multiple realizations of the processes that produced the two original light curves, the statistical significance of the difference between the 1999 and 2000\n\n7\n\nFig. 5. Autocorrelation function of the 3C 390.3 light curves\nduring the 1999 (filled circles) and 2000 (open diamonds) campaigns. Time bins are 3 days wide.\n\nSFs (and therefore the non-stationarity of the light curve) can\nbe assessed in the following way.\nFor each pair of synthetic light curves, the SF is calculated\nand a parameter quantifying the difference is computed. This\nquantity is the sum of the squares of the differences between\nP\nthe two SFs at each time lag, DSF \u2261 [S F1 (\u03c4i ) \u2212 S F2 (\u03c4i )]2 .\nThe method assumes that the differences between the SFs in\nthe 104 simulated pairs, DSF,sim , will be distributed around the\nobserved difference, DSF,obs , in a way similar to the distribution\nof the DSF,obs values around true value, DSF,true . If the differences in the observed SFs are the result of the red noise character of the light curves, we would expect that DSF,true = 0.\nBased now on the distribution of the DSF,sim values, we found\nthat the probability that the DSF,obs value would be as large as\nit is, under the assumption that DSF,true = 0, is less than 0.1%.\nWe conclude that the difference between the 1999 and 2000 SF\nis significant at a 99.9% level.\nThe model-independent Monte Carlo experiment on the SF\nindicates that the X-ray emitting process in 3C 390.3 is not\neven a second-order stationary process, with the main difference between the 1999 and 2000 light curves arising at longer\ntime scales. Up to time scales of the order of \u223c 100 days, the\n1999 and 2000 SFs resemble the structure function of red-noise\nprocess which has a power law PSD with slope \u223c \u22122, consistent with the PSD results (section 3.1). At lower frequencies the PSD cannot be computed accurately because the light\ncurves include less than three cycles of any variability pattern.\nAlthough the differences between the 1999 and 2000 PSDs are\nnot statistically significant, the two SFs differ significantly from\neach other on long time scales.\nThe SF results suggest that the power-law index of the 2000\nPSD probably changes from \u22122 to \u22121 at fbr \u223c 1/100 days,\nwhile this break frequency is much lower during the 1999 ob-\n\n\f8\n\nM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\nservations. This suggestion is entirely consistent with the PSD\nfitting results: there is a possibility of a break in the 2000\nPSD, but not in the 1999 PSD. This \"break-frequency\" variation could be the reason for the the detection of non-stationarity\nin the 2 light curves.\nIn order to investigate this further, we performed also\na model-dependent numerical experiment, assuming a given\nPSD function. The observed 1999 and 2000 PSDs (section 3.1)\nappear quite similar, but they extend to frequencies \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22127\nHz only, due to the binning necessary for a reliable PSD estimation. These frequencies correspond to a time scale of \u223c 5 \u00d7 106\ns, i.e. the time scale above which the most obvious differences in the observed SFs are evident (Fig. 4). As all modeldependent methods, the outcome of these Monte Carlo simulations based on an assumed \"model-PSD\" will depend on the\nassumptions made.\nWe assumed that both the 1999 and 2000 light curves are\na realization of a process with a power spectrum of power-law\nindex \u22122 down to a frequency of 1/(100 days), below which\nthe power-law index changes to \u22121. The break time scale of\n100 days was found using the Markowitz et al. (2003) relation\n(see section 3.1), and assuming as estimate of the BH mass\nfor 3C 390.3 the value obtained by Peterson et al. (2004) from\nthe reverberation mapping. Then, we created two sets of 5\u00d7103\nsynthetic light curves assuming this power spectrum model (using the method of Timmer & Koenig 1995). The length of the\nsynthetic light curves was 20 times longer than the length of the\nobserved light curves, and the points in them were separated by\nan interval of 3 days. In this way, we could simulate the effects\nof the red noise leakage in the estimation of the SF, although\nthe aliasing effects were not accounted for. This should not be\na serious problem though, as the steep power spectral slope (2) implies that these effects should not be very strong. Each\nsynthetic light curve was then re-sampled in such a way so that\nthey have the same length and sampling pattern as the observed\nlight curves. The light curves of the first (second) set had the\nsame sampling pattern, mean, and variance as the 1999 (2000)\nlight curve. The SF of each simulated light curve was computed, producing a \"synthetic model\" of the 1999 and 2000 SF.\nFinally, the observed 1999 and 2000 SFs were compared with\nthese synthetic model. The results indicate that the 2000 light\ncurve is consistent (at more than 10% confidence level) with\nthe \"synthetic model\", i.e., with the hypothesis that the power\nspectrum has a break at a time scale of approximately 100 days,\nwhile the 1999 light curve is not consistent with this model at\nthe 99% confidence level.\nThis result suggests that the PSD break moves to lower frequencies. Indeed, when we repeated the numerical experiment\nwith a break 1/400 days, the 1999 SF was now consistent with\nthe data (with a probability larger than 10%), while the 2000\nSF was not (at the 99% confidence level). However, if a PSD\nmodel with breaks at intermediate frequencies (e.g., 1/200 \u2013\n1/300 days) is considered, no conclusive results can be drawn,\nsince the synthetic SF is now marginally consistent with both\nthe 1999 and 2000 SFs.\nBased on the SF analysis and extensive simulations, we\nconclude that there is suggestive evidence that one of the differences between the 1999 and 2000 light curves is caused by a\n\nchange in the characteristic time scale of the system, although\nwe cannot firmly rule out that the 2 SFs could result from\nthe same red noise process (with a PSD showing a break at\n\u223c 1/200-1/300 days).\nThis conclusion (i.e., the detection of an intrinsic difference\nin the temporal properties of the two light curves) is supported\nby the the auto-correlation functions of the 1999 and 2000 light\ncurves (see Fig 5), estimated by using the Discrete Correlation\nFunction (DCF) method of Edelson & Krolik (1988). The rate\nat which the auto-correlation function decays to zero may be\ninterpreted as a measure of the \"memory\" of the process and\nthus Fig 5 indicates that the \"memory\" of the 2000 light curve\nis shorter than that of the first 1999 light curve.\n\n4.4. Time-independent Analysis: Probability Density\nFunction\nIn the previous two subsections, we found evidence for nonstationarity in the light curve of 3C 390.3, by utilizing methods\nwhich are based on the temporal order of the data points. For\nthe SF analysis, the dependence on the temporal position of the\ndata points is trivial, given the definition S F(\u03c4) = h[r(t) \u2212 r(t +\n\u03c4)]2 i, where r(t) and r(t + \u03c4) are the light curve data points at\ntimes t and t + \u03c4, respectively. For the non-linear method, this\ndependence can be easily recognized, by keeping in mind that\nthe relative positions of the data points forming a phase space\nportrait simply reflect the temporal separations between data\npoints in the light curve.\nHere we investigate the stationarity of 3C 390.3 with a\nmethod independent of the temporal order of the data points,\nthe probability density function (PDF), which is the histogram\nof the different count rates recorded during the monitoring campaign. Fig 6 shows the normalized distributions (r \u2212 hri)/hri\nof the 1999 (top panel) and 2000 (bottom panel) monitoring\ncampaigns. The first transformation (r \u2212 hri) brings both light\ncurves to zero mean, the second, normalizes the amplitudes to\nunit mean. This way, the relative amplitudes of the light curves\nare directly probed, and the PDF results can be directly compared to the power spectral ones, which use exactly the same\nconvention.\nFor a better visual comparison, we have used small time\nbins of 32 s in Fig. 6. However, for a quantitative comparison between PDFs (see below), we have used larger time bins\nto prevent any contamination from the Poisson noise. There\nis a clear qualitative difference between the two PDFs, with\nthe 1999 distribution characterized by two broad peaks and the\n2000 PDF having a bell shape. This qualitative difference is\nconfirmed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, which gives a\nprobability of 99.99% that the two distributions are different.\nOne may ask what are the effects on the PDF properties of\nthe light curve bin size, whether the PDF is really time independent (a question that is directly related to the length of the\nlight curve), and whether the K-S test is appropriate to quantify\nthe statistical difference between two PDFs or not. The answers\nto these questions are not clear. In all cases, the most important\nissue is the red-noise character of the AGN light curves (in all\nwavebands). As the size of the light curve bins decreases, the\n\n\fM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\n9\n\nwe constructed time-independent PDFs and used the K-S test\nto assess the significance of the difference.\nIn the first approach, we created 104 pairs of synthetic light\ncurves, utilizing the same model-independent method used for\nthe SF analysis, and computed their PDFs. We quantified their\ndifferences by computing their squared differences, DPDF \u2261\nP\n[PDF1 (i) \u2212 PDF2 (i)]2 , and assumed that the distribution of\nthe 104 synthetic DPDF values is representative of the \"true\"\ndistribution of this quantity, as if we had actually observed\n3C 390.3 for 104 times. If the process is stationary, we would\nexpect that DPDF,real = 0. Using the distribution of the 104 synthetic DPDF values, we found that the difference between the\n1999 and 2000 PDFs is significant at a confidence level of more\nthan 99.99%.\n\nFig. 6. Probability density function of count rates scaled and\nnormalized with respect to the average count rate hri, during\nthe 1999 (top panel) and 2000 (bottom panel) monitoring campaign. The time bins are 32 s wide.\nnumber of the points in the PDF increases, and the sampled\nPDF is better defined. However, as the points added are heavily correlated due to the red-noise character of the variations,\nno \"extra\" information is added to the PDF. On the other hand,\nsince the \"sensitivity\" of the K-S test increases with the number\nof points in the sampled PDF (which are assumed to be independent), there is a possibility that differences which are purely\ndue to the stochastic nature of a possible stationary process will\nbe magnified and the K-S test will erroneously indicate \"significant\" differences between two PDFs. Finally, one should also\nconsider the effects of the Poisson noise to the sampled PDFs.\nIn the cases where the source signal has a much larger amplitude than the variations caused by the experimental noise (as is\nthe case here), we should not expect this effect to be of any significance. In any case, the Poisson noise should produce similar\nPDFs (once they are normalized to their mean) so any significant differences cannot be due to this effect.\nTo assess the statistical difference between PDFs in a more\nrigorous way, we have used two different methods: 1) we constructed PDFs using small time bins (we used 160 s instead of\n32 s to limit the computational effort) and carried out Monte\nCarlo simulations in the same fashion as we did for the SF; 2)\n\nIn the second approach, the time independent PDFs were\nconstructed in the following way. First we binned the 1999 and\n2000 light curves at 512 s. In this way, each observation, which\nhas a typical duration of \u223c1000\u20132000 s, contains up to four\ncontiguous data points. Four different PDFs were constructed,\ncontaining respectively the first, the second, the third, and the\nfourth data point of each observation. This procedure was applied to both light curves, giving rise to PDF1a , PDF1b , PDF1c ,\nPDF1d for the 1999 light curve, and PDF2a , PDF2b , PDF2c ,\nPDF2d for the 2000 monitoring campaign. In a way, we can assume that the 8 PDFs are computed from the observations of 8\nindividual observers, half of them observing 3C 390.3 in 1999,\nand the other half in 2000, each one with a time difference of\n512 s from the other. When we use the K-S test, the four distributions from the 1999 observations, PDF1a,b,c,d, appear to be\nidentical to each other. The same result holds when we compare the four 2000 PDFs, i.e. PDF2a,b,c,d. This is not surprising,\nas consecutive points are strongly correlated, as we mentioned\nabove. However, when we compare any of the PDF1a,b,c,d functions with the respective 2000 function, the K-S test suggests\nhighly significant differences (with a confidence level higher\nthan \u223c 99.9% for PDF1a to be different from PDF2a , and a\nsomewhat lower confidence level for the other PDF pairs, due\nto the lower number of points of their respective distributions).\nOne possibility for this significant difference between the\n1999 and 2000 PDFs is that the one year period is shorter\nthan the \"characteristic\" time scale of the system. As we mentioned in Section 3.1, based on the BH mass estimate of the\nsource, we expect a characteristic time scale of the order of\n\u223c 100 days, shorter than the duration of the two light curves.\nHowever, a second, longer characteristic time scale must exist. This time scale will correspond to the frequency where the\nPSD should flatten to a slope of \u223c zero. This is necessary for\nthe PSD to have a finite value at zero frequency, otherwise we\nhave to assume an \"infinite\" memory for the system. Although\nthis time scale is probably longer than the length of the two\nlight curves, it is very unlikely that this effect can explain the\ndifferences between the 1999 and 2000 PDFs. The reason is\nthat we have subtracted the respective mean values from the\ntwo light curves, and we have normalized to the mean. In this\nway, all the long-term variations, which are not fully sampled\nby the present light curves, are suppressed. As a result, most\nof the variations present in the the zero-mean, normalized light\n\n\f10\n\nM.

Star symbols correspond to the first\n200 days of the 1999 light curve, the filled dots describe the\nsecond part of the 1999 campaign, and the open diamond the\n2000 light curve. For the sake of clarity, only a characteristic\nerror for each cluster of points has been plotted. All the errors\nassociated with the X-ray colors are reported in Fig 1 bottom\npanel. Time bins are 5760s (\u223c 1 RXTE orbit).\ncurves should be caused mainly by components that are fully\nsampled.\nOn the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the\nPDFs associated with the 1999 and 2000 light curves are significantly different, with the former characterized by a bimodal\ndistribution and the latter by a uniform distribution around the\nmean, and that the X-ray emission process in 3C 390.3 is indeed non-stationary.\n\nFig. 8.

The dashed line\nrepresents a linear least squares fit to all the data points.\n\nhardening towards low flux states. However, the scatter of the\nhardness ratio points is very large, and it seems that during this\nstate, the spectrum variations are more or less independent of\nthe source flux variations. So, based on the color\u2013count rate\nplot, it seems possible that during this period the X-ray emission mechanism may behave in a different way, although the\nerrors associated with the X-ray colors (see Fig 1 bottom panel)\nprevent us from reaching a firm conclusion.\nTable 1. Time Intervals Used for Time-Resolved Spectral\nAnalysis\n\n5. A Spectral Transition?\nIn order to investigate whether the changes of the statistical\ntiming properties are accompanied by spectral variations, and\nspecifically if 3C 390.3 is experiencing an actual state transition, we have performed two different kinds of analysis.\n1) The first (model-independent) method is based on the X-ray\ncolor \u2013 count rate plot, often used for GBHs to separate the\nspectral states. The plot of X-ray color (i.e., the ratio of the 7\u2013\n20 over the 2\u20135 keV count rate) versus the total 2\u201320 keV count\nrate is shown in Fig 7. The hardness ratio clearly decreases\nwith increasing flux, during the second part of the 1999 and the\nwhole of the 2000 campaigns. This trend is typical of type 1\nradio-quiet AGN, and has been observed many times in the past\n(e.g., Papadakis et al. 2002; Taylor et al. 2004, and references\ntherein). This supports the conclusions of Gliozzi et al. (2002),\nthat the X-ray emission in 3C 390.3 is not jet-dominated.\nDuring the first half of the 1999 campaign, the source was\nat its lowest flux state. The spectrum of the source also appears\nto be quite hard, consistent with the general trend of spectral\n\na\n\nStart Time\n(y/m/d h:m)\n\nEnd Time\n(y/m/d h:m)\n\nExposure\n(ks)\n\nFluxa\n\n\u0393\n\n99/01/08 00:26\n99/02/28 16:48\n99/05/14 00:58\n99/07/13 08:56\n99/09/14 18:07\n99/11/17 14:25\n00/01/06 11:50\n00/03/03 04:26\n00/05/14 08:41\n00/07/07 00:09\n00/09/05 5:52\n00/11/13 12:57\n01/01/03 08:53\n\n99/02/25 17:58\n99/05/11 01:05\n99/07/10 20:15\n99/09/11 16:03\n99/11/13 22:58\n00/01/03 08:00\n00/02/29 06:57\n00/05/11 12:43\n00/07/04 01:22\n00/09/01 22:29\n00/11/10 12:12\n00/12/31 03:12\n01/02/24 00:26\n\n17.90\n24.10\n21.20\n22.56\n23.38\n18.69\n15.26\n32.46\n22.50\n26.91\n32.22\n25.47\n24.45\n\n1.87\n1.68\n2.64\n3.86\n3.71\n4.71\n3.84\n4.90\n3.80\n4.10\n3.91\n5.03\n3.46\n\n1.550.08\n0.05\n1.540.03\n0.05\n1.640.03\n0.04\n1.680.02\n0.03\n1.670.02\n0.02\n1.740.02\n0.02\n1.660.02\n0.03\n1.700.01\n0.02\n1.610.03\n0.02\n1.630.02\n0.02\n1.620.01\n0.02\n1.670.02\n0.02\n1.610.02\n0.02\n\n2\u201310 keV flux in units of (10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), calculated assuming a\npower law plus Gaussian line model.\n\n\fM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\n2) More stringent constraints can be derived by using a second\n(model-dependent) method: the time-resolved spectral analysis. Since the data consist of short snapshots spanning a long\ntemporal baseline, they are well suited for monitoring the spectral variability of the source.\nWe divided the light curve of Figure 1 into thirteen intervals, of duration 50\u201360 days each, with net exposures times\nranging between 15 ks and 32 ks. this scheme represents a\ntrade-off between the necessity to isolate intervals with different but well defined average count rates and the need to reach a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) high enough for a meaningful spectral analysis. The dates, exposure times and mean fluxes in the\nnine selected intervals are listed in Table 1.\nWe fitted the 4\u201320 keV spectra with a model consisting of\na power-law, absorbed by the Galactic absorbing column, plus\na Gaussian Fe K\u03b1 line with a rest energy fixed at 6.4 keV. In all\nthe intervals, the line is statistically required at more than 99%\nconfidence level, according to an F-test. However, due to the\nlow S/N, the line parameters are characterized by large errors\n(\u223c 100% on the line flux and width) and thus their evolution\nin time cannot be investigated properly. On the other hand, the\nphoton indices are well constrained with uncertainties of the\norder of 1\u20133%. Figure 8 shows the plot of the photon index \u0393\nversus the 2\u201310 keV flux, with the filled dots representing intervals during the 1999 campaign and open diamonds during\nthe 2000 campaign. The photon index increases steadily with\nthe 2\u201310 keV flux, without any indication of a discontinuity between the \u0393 corresponding to the low state and the other photon\nindices. This result, which clearly argues against the presence\nof a bona fide state transition, is not totally unexpected if we\nconsider the time scales at play: in GBHs state transitions take\nplace on time scales of hours-days (e.g., Zdziarski et al. 2004),\nwhich translate into thousands of years for 3C 390.3, assuming\na linear scaling between the black hole masses.\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that 3C 390.3 is\nnot undergoing a transition between two distinct spectral states\nduring the RXTE monitoring.\n\n6. Discussion\nWe have studied two one-year long, well sampled X-ray light\ncurves of 3C 390.3 from the RXTE archive, in search of nonstationarity. This object is a broad-line radio galaxy, for which\na long-term ROSAT light curve has shown evidence for nonlinearity and possibly non-stationarity in the past at soft X-rays\n(Leighly & O'Brien, 1997). The light curves we have used are\nthe longest, and best sampled light curves on time scales of\ndays/months of this source to date. Hence, they offer a unique\nopportunity to investigate the important issue of stationarity in\nthe X-ray light curves of AGN.\nTests for stationarity of AGN light curves provide important insights into the physical connection between AGN and\nGBHs. In the past few years, the PSD analysis of long, high\nsignal-to-noise, well sampled X-ray light curves of a few AGN\nhave shown clearly that the X-ray variability properties of these\nobjects are very similar to those of GBHs (e.g. Uttley et al.,\n2002; Markowitz et al., 2003; McHardy et al., 2004). However,\none of the most interesting aspects of the X-ray variability be-\n\n11\n\nhavior of the GBHs is that they often show transitions to different \"states\". Even when in the same state, their timing properties, like the PSD, varies with time. For example, during the\n\"low/hard state\", the frequency breaks in the X-ray power spectrum of Cyg X-1 change with time (Belloni & Hasinger, 1990;\nPottschmidt et al., 2003). This is one example of \"stationarityloss\", which can offer important clues on the mechanism responsible for the observed variations. \"State\" transitions or, in\ngeneral, time variations of the statistical properties of the light\ncurve have not been observed so far in AGN.\n\n6.1. Multi-technique Timing Approach\nIn order to assess whether the light curve of 3C 390.3 is nonstationarity, we performed a thorough temporal analysis based\non different complementary timing techniques and extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations. The first advantage of this approach\nis that it leads to more robust results, not biased by the specific\ncharacteristics of a single method. In addition, since the diverse\nmethods employed probe different statistical properties, they\nprovide us with complementary pieces of information that can\nbe combined to constrain the physical mechanism underlying\nthe observed variability.\n1. The Scaling Index method, with the 1999 distribution peaking at a value lower than the 2000 one, indicates that the\ndegree of randomness was higher during the 2000 light\ncurve, which may lead to the speculation that the number of (coupled) active zones was larger in 2000 than in\n1999. However, since the nature (stochastic vs. chaotic) of\nthe time variability is still unknown, no further physical\ninsights can be derived from this non-linear tool. Indeed,\nas pointed out by Vio et al. (1992), a naive application of\nnon-linear methods may lead to conceptual errors, like the\ndetection of low-dimensional dynamics from signals produced by stochastic processes. Here the nonlinear statistics\nbased on the scaling index is used only as a statistical test\nto discriminate between two time series, not to determine\nany kind of dimension, which would be meaningless for\nnon-deterministic systems.\n2. The Power Spectral Density analysis is the only method\nthat does not indicate the presence of non-stationarity at\na high significance level. A difference between the results\nfrom PSD and those from the scaling index method and\nthe PDF may be expected, since the latter techniques probe\nhigher order statistical properties compared to the PSD.\nThe difference between the PSD and the SF analysis may\nappear more puzzling. However, since even the PSD analysis results suggest that the characteristic time scale of the\nsystem moves to lower frequencies in 1999, we believe that\nboth methods suggest similar trends. The main difference\ncan probably be ascribed to the necessity for the PSD to average over many data segments, which reduces the length\nof the time interval probed, degrades the frequency resolution, thus preventing the PSD from being a very sensitive\nmethod for detecting non-stationarity.\n3. At time scales shorter than \u223c 100 days the results from\nthe Structure Function analysis are consistent with the PSD\n\n\f12\n\nM. Gliozzi et al.: Non-stationary variability in AGN: the case of 3C 390.3\n\nanalysis: the power spectrum of the source follows a typical power-law form with an index of approximately \u22122. At\nlonger time scales though, the two SFs are different: while\nthe 2000 SF appears to flatten to a roughly constant level\n(showing several wiggles), the 1999 SF keeps rising up to\nthe largest time lags sampled. Model-independent Monte\nCarlo simulations suggest that these differences are significant, but no firm conclusions can be drawn from modeldependent simulations. On the the other hand, the periodograms of the two light curves are not significantly different (as shown by the \"S\" statistic). This result could be\ndue to the low number of periodogram estimates at these\nlong frequencies. It seems that the use of the SF analysis\ncan be useful for the detection of non-stationarity in two\nlight curves, provided that the results are thoroughly tested\nwith extensive simulations. Although the points in the sampled SFs are heavily correlated, these functions can still reveal the presence of significant structure more efficiently\nthan the sampled power spectrum.\nThe shape of the 1999 and 2000 SFs at long time scales\nreveals that the characteristic time scales are quite different during the two RXTE campaigns. These findings are\nconfirmed by the zero crossing time scale in the autocorrelation functions (Fig 5), showing that the characteristic time scale of the 2000 light curve is of the order of \u223c100\nd, whereas in the 1999 light curve it should be at least 2 \u2212 3\ntimes longer.\n4. Perhaps, the most telling difference between the timing\nproperties of the 1999 and 2000 light curves of 3C 390.3 is\nrevealed by the comparison of the two Probability Density\nFunctions (see Fig 6): the data points in the 1999 light curve\nfollow a bimodal distribution, whereas the points in the\n2000 light curve follow a uniform distribution. This may\nimply that the \"anomaly\" causing the non-stationarity occurs during the first campaign, when two different physical\nprocesses seem to be at work.\nThe results from the present work, which reveal the presence of non-stationarity in the X-ray light curves of 3C 390.3,\nsuggest, that the variability properties of the AGN light curves\nmay also vary with time, in the same way as they do in GBHs.\nTherefore, this similarity further strengthens the analogy between the X-ray variability properties of AGN and GBHs.\n\n6.2. Analogy between 3C 390.3 and Cyg X-1\nBased on the time-resolved spectral analysis described in \u00a75,\nwe have concluded that 3C 390.3 is not undergoing a genuine\ntransition between two distinct spectral states. Nontheless, it\nis instructive to compare the spectral and temporal behavior\nexhibited by 3C 390.3 with the rich phenomenology shown by\nGBHs on short time scales within a single spectral state.\nIndeed, from the comparison of the the X-ray spectral and\ntemporal properties of 3C 390.3 properties with those of Cyg\nX\u20131 in the hard state presented by Pottschmidt et al. (2003),\nwe can infer a qualitative similarity. In spite of the different\nmethods used to study Cyg X\u20131 and 3C 390.3, for both objects\nwe find evidence that both the spectral and temporal properties\n\nchange continuously and in a similar way: when the energy\nspectrum becomes harder, the temporal properties are characterized by longer time scales.\nWe can, therefore, conclude that the temporal and spectral\nbehavior of 3C 390.3, as seen by RXTE during the 1999 and\n2000 monitoring campaigns, qualitalively mimics the properties of the GBH Cyg X\u20131 during the low/hard state, provided\nthat the appropriate time scales are compared.\n\n7. Summary and Conclusions\nThe main results of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2013 For the first time, strong evidence of non-stationarity is observed in an AGN light curve. This is particularly important in view of the analogy hypothesized between AGN\nand GBHs, since a loss of stationary could correspond to\na change in the timing properties of the X-ray light curves\nin GBHs. Thus, our results reinforce the similarity between\nthe X-ray variability properties of AGN and GBHs.\n\u2013 One of the causes of the non-stationarity is likely to be the\nchange of the characteristic time scale between 1999 and\n2000, as suggested by the SF and ACF analyses. By analogy with GBH phenomenology, this loss of stationarity is\nlikely to correspond to a change in the frequency break observed in Cyg X-1 in the low/hard state (e.g., Pottschmidt et\nal., 2003), rather than a a transition between spectral states.\n\u2013 The PSD analysis, often considered the most reliable\nmethod to search for non-stationarity, in this case is probably not sensitive enough to detect it, although there are hints\nfor the presence of a frequency break in the 2000 PSD and\nnot in the 1999 PSD. On the other hand, a number of different timing techniques, such as the structure function analysis coupled with Monte Carlo simulations, the non-linear\nscaling index method, and the time-independent PDF, prove\nto be powerful tools to discriminate between two time series and therefore search for non-stationarity. The PDF, in\nparticular, offers a direct demonstration of non-stationarity,\nshowing a bimodal distribution in 1999, but a uniform distribution in 2000.\nAcknowledgements.
