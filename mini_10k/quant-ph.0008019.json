Introduction\nThe subject of operational quantum logic - lying somewhere at the crossroads of\nmathematics, physics and philosophy - has a long and complicated history, and\nhas generated a large, scattered and unruly literature. It is not an easy thing to\nexplain, in a few words, what it is supposed to be about! Our best attempt is to\nsay that operational quantum logic involves\n(a) the fact that the structure of the 2-valued observables in orthodox quantum\nmechanics may usefully be regarded as a non-classical propositional logic,\n(b) the attempt to give independent motivation for this structure, as part of a\ngeneral programme to understand quantum mechanics, and\n(c) the branch of pure mathematics that has grown out of (a) and (b), and now\nconcerns itself with a variety of \"orthomodular\" structures generalizing the\nlogic of 2-valued quantum observables.\nWhatever else it may be, quantum logic is a living, growing part of contemporary mathematics and theoretical physics - one that has continued to hold\nthe interest of a body of mathematicians, physicists and philosophers of science.\nThis sustained interest reflects in part the fact that the basic ideas and language\nof quantum logic inform most discussions of the vexing foundational problems\nof quantum mechanics (indeed, to a degree that is often not recognized even by\nthe discussants). It reflects also the fact that quantum logic has spawned an autonomous and fascinating branch of pure mathematics concerned with a variety\nof structures - orthomodular lattices and posets, orthoalgebras, partial Boolean\nalgebras, etc. - generalizing P(H). Finally, the recent advent of quantum computation and quantum information theory offers a field of practical applications\nfor quantum logic which has yet to be fully explored.\nHistorically, quantum logic derives from von Neumann's (more than casual)\nobservation that the 2-valued observables, represented in his formulation of quantum mechanics by projection operators, constitute a sort of \"logic\" of experimental\npropositions. This idea was further pursued by Birkhoff and von Neumann. After\ntwo decades of neglect, interest in quantum logic was revived, due in large part to\nMackey's analysis of the probabilistic calculus of standard quantum theory coupled with his theory of induced representations. The further development of the\nsubject has occurred at several levels and in a number of directions. Mackey's\nwork was extended significantly by Piron, whose representation theorem and axiomatic framework provided much impetus for further development. At the same\ntime, dissatisfaction with Mackey's axiomatic framework led to a search for more\nprimitive, and more concretely operational, foundations. Notable here is the work\nof Foulis and Randall, and also that of Ludwig and his colleagues at Marburg.\nWork in foundational physics has also stimulated, and been stimulated by, purely\nmathematical research, notably in the development of an abstract theory of orthomodular lattices and, in recent years, more general structures such as orthoalgebras and effect algebras. More recently still, the subject has seen the application\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n3\n\nof powerful category-theoretic techniques. Given the somewhat overwhelming variety of these developments, in this introductory essay, we are going to attempt\nan outline of quantum logic that will help readers who are not already experts in\nthe subject to understand the various papers that are produced - and also, to\nsee them as belonging to a common subject. We start by discussing the seminal\nwork of Birkhoff and von Neumann and its development by Mackey. We then turn\nto a brief exposition of Piron's representation theorem and his axiomatic framework, referring the reader to [Coecke and Moore 2000] and [Valckenborgh 2000]\nfor expositions in a more contemporary, categorical idiom. Next, we discuss the\nwork of Foulis and Randall, in particular their introduction of the notion of an\northoalgebra, and their observation that tensor products of orthomodular posets\ngenerally exist only as orthoalgebras. The Foulis-Randall formalism is discussed in\ndetail in [Wilce 2000]. We follow with a general exposition of the pure mathematical theory of orthomodular structures. For more details on orthomodular lattices\nwe refer to [Bruns and Harding 2000], for observables on orthomodular posets to\n[Ptak 2000] and for group representations on (interval) effect algebras to [Foulis\n2000]. Finally, we mention the notion of categorical enrichment and the theory of\nquantales, surveyed respectively in [Borceux and Stubbe 2000] and [Paseka and\nRosick\u00fd 2000], before introducing computational and linguistic aspects, treated\nrespectively in [Resende 2000] and [Gudder 2000].\n\n2. Von Neumann's quantum mechanics\nWhile precise mathematical treatments of quantum mechanics existed before Johann von Neumann's monumental treatise [1932], it may reasonably be argued\nthat this work fixed once and for all the theoretical framework of standard quantum theory, in which each quantum mechanical system is associated with a Hilbert\nspace H, each unit vector \u03c8 \u2208 H determines a state of the system, and each observable physical quantity associated with the system is represented by a self-adjoint\noperator A on H. The spectral theorem tells us that such an operator is associated\nwith a spectral measure\nPA : B(R) \u2192 P(H)\nassigning to each real Borel set B a projection operator PA (B) on H. For any\nunit vector \u03c8 \u2208 H, the quantity\n\u03bcA,\u03c8 (B) := hPA (B)\u03c8, \u03c8i\nthen defines a probability measure on the line, which von Neumann regards as\ngiving the probability that the observable (represented by) A has a value in the\nset B when the system's state is (represented by) \u03c8. If the identity function has\nfinite variance in \u03bcA,\u03c8 , then \u03c8 is in the domain of A, and the expectation value of\nA relative to \u03c8 is given by\nR\nExp(A, \u03c8) = R s d\u03bcA,\u03c8 (s).\n\n\f4\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nOne easily checks that this works out to Exp(A, \u03c8) = hA\u03c8, \u03c8i .\n\n2.1. THE LOGIC OF PROJECTIONS\nIf the Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik signalled the passage\ninto maturity of quantum mechanics, it also signalled the birth of quantum logic.\nEvidently, it is the projection-valued measure PA , more than the operator A, that\nmost directly carries the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics outlined\nabove. Now, as von Neumann notes, each projection P \u2208 P(H) itself defines an\nobservable - one with values 0 and 1. If P = PA (B) is the spectral projection\nassociated with an observable A and a Borel set B, we may construe this observable\nas \"testing\" whether or not A takes a value in B. Von Neumann regards P as\nrepresenting a physical property of the system (or rather, of the system's states).\nHe remarks that\n\"the relation between the properties of a physical system on the one\nhand, and the projections on the other, makes possible a sort of logical\ncalculus with these. However, in contrast to the concepts of ordinary\nlogic, this system is extended by the concept of 'simultaneous decidability' which is characteristic for quantum mechanics.\" [von Neumann\n1932, p.253]\nIndeed, if P and Q are commuting projections, then their meet P \u2227Q and join P \u2228Q\nin the lattice P(H) may be interpreted classically as representing the conjunction\nand disjunction of the properties encoded by P and Q; further, the projection\nP \u2032 = 1\u2212P serves as a sort of negation for P . If P and Q do not commute, however,\nthen they are not \"simultaneously decidable\", and the meaning of P \u2227Q and P \u2228Q\nis less clear. Nevertheless, P(H) retains many features of a Boolean algebra, and\nmay be regarded as an algebraic model for a non-classical propositional logic. In\nparticular, P(H) is orthocomplemented and so enjoys analogues of the de Morgan\nlaws; more sharply, the sub-ortholattice generated by any commuting family of\nprojections is a Boolean algebra.\n\n2.2. THE LOGIC OF QUANTUM MECHANICS\nIt is noteworthy that von Neumann speaks of the simultaneous \"decidability\"\n(i.e., testability) of properties, but does not distinguish between decidable and\nundecidable properties per se. Classically, of course, any subset of the statespace counts as a categorical property of the system, and nothing in principle\nprevents us from taking the same view in quantum mechanics. However, only those\nsubsets of the state space corresponding to closed linear subspaces of the Hilbert\nspace are associated with observables, and so \"decidable\" by measurement. If one\nadopts a rather severe positivism, according to which no un-decidable proposition\nis meaningful at all, one is led to the seemingly strange doctrine that, for a quantum\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n5\n\nmechanical system, the set of meaningful properties forms, not a Boolean algebra,\nbut rather the lattice P(H) of projections of a Hilbert space.\nThis idea was further developed by von Neumann in a joint paper with Garrett\nBirkhoff entitled The Logic of Quantum Mechanics [Birkhoff and von Neumann\n1936]. Birkhoff and von Neumann observe that P(H) retains a number of the\nfamiliar features of the algebra of classical propositional logic - in particular, it\nis orthocomplemented and hence satisfies de Morgan's laws. It is not, however,\nBoolean - that is, the distributive law fails. Birkhoff and von Neumann go so far\nas to suggest that\n\"whereas logicians have usually assumed that properties L71-L73 of\nnegation were the ones least able to withstand a critical analysis, the\nstudy of mechanics point to the distributive identities L6 as the weakest\nlink in the algebra of logic.\" [Birkhoff and von Neumann 1936, p.839]\nAs we shall see in section 7, this remark is rather deeper than one may imagine, being interpretable in terms of the fundamental difference between Heyting algebras\nand orthomodular lattices considered as generalizations of Boolean algebra.\nThis suggestion that the projection lattice may be viewed as a propositional\nlogic has been understood in a number of rather different ways. Some have seen\nit as calling into question the correctness of classical logic. Others have seen it as\nentailing a less drastic modification of classical probability theory. As we have seen,\nvon Neumann himself [1932 \u00a73.5] is rather cautious, remarking that the equivalence\nbetween subspaces and projections induces a sort of logical calculus. Similarly,\nBirkhoff and von Neumann [1936 \u00a70] conclude that by heuristic arguments one\ncan reasonably expect to find a calculus of propositions for quantum mechanical\nsystems which is formally indistinguishable from the calculus of subspaces and\nresembles the usual logical calculus.\nMore radical is the view of Finkelstein [1968, 1972] that logic is in a certain\nsense empirical, a view championed by such philosophical luminaries as Putnam\n[1968, 1976]. Finkelstein highlighted the abstractions we make in passing from\nmechanics to geometry to logic, and suggested that the dynamical processes of\nfracture and flow already observed at the first two levels should also arise at the\nthird. Putnam, on the other hand, argued that the metaphysical pathologies\nof superposition and complementarity are nothing more than artifacts of logical\ncontradictions generated by an indiscriminate use of the distributive law.\nThis view of the matter, which remains popular in some quarters,4 depends on\na reading of the projection P as encoding a physical property of the quantal system,\nand on the assumption that only physical properties are ultimately to count as\n4 For instance, Bamberg and Sternberg [1990, pp.833-835] write: \"In fact, [quantum mechanics] represents the most profound revolution in the history of science, because it modifies the\nelementary rules of logic. . . . [T]he distributive law does not hold in quantum logic. As we\nmentioned above, the validity of quantum mechanics has been experimentally demonstrated over\nand over again during the past sixty years. So experiment has shown that one must abandon\none of the most cherished principles of logic when dealing with quantum observables.\"\n\n\f6\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nmeaningful (or at any rate, as fundamental). There is, however, a different way\nof construing P , namely, that it encodes a statement about the possible result of\nsome \"measurement\". Thus, if A is the self-adjoint operator corresponding to the\nobservable A and P = PA (B) is the spectral projection of A corresponding to the\nBorel set B, we might construe P as encoding the proposition that a measurement\nof A would yield a value in E if made. This construal, usually dubbed operational,\nguided Mackey in his reconstruction of von Neumann's quantum mechanics, to\nwhich we now turn.\n\n3. Mackey's programme\nIn an influential paper [1957], subsequently expanded into the monograph [1963],\nGeorge Mackey argued (a) that one could reconstruct most if not all of the apparatus of von Neumann's quantum mechanics from the premise that the experimental\npropositions form an ortholattice isomorphic to P(H), and (b) that this premise\nitself could be independently motivated by very general considerations about how\nprobabilistic models of physical systems ought to look.\n\n3.1. QUANTUM MECHANICS AS A PROBABILITY CALCULUS\nMackey construed quantum mechanics as simply being a non-classical probability\ncalculus, in which the Boolean algebra of events of classical probability theory is\nreplaced by the lattice P(H). More exactly, Mackey stressed that both the states\nand the observables of a quantum mechanical system can be defined purely in\nterms of P(H). First, any statistical state W determines a probability measure on\nP(H), namely the mapping\n\u03c9W : P(H) \u2192 [0, 1]; P 7\u2192 tr(P W ).\nA deep theorem by Gleason [Gleason 1957; Dvure\u010denskij 1993] shows that, conversely, every \u03c3-additive probability measure on P(H) has this form. Second, an\nobservable with values in the measurable space (S, F) may be represented by a\nprojection-valued measure\nM : F \u2192 P(H)\nwhere, for each measurable set B \u2208 F, the projection M (B) is taken to encode the\n\"experimental proposition\" that a measurement of the observable yields a value\nin the set B. Evidently, we may pull probability measures on P(H) back along M\nto obtain a classical probability measure on F. We interpret M \u2217 (\u03c9) = \u03c9 \u25e6 M as\ngiving the statistical distribution of values of M (in S) when the system is in the\nstate represented by \u03c9. In other words,\n\u03c9W (M (B)) = tr(M (B)W )\nrepresents the probability that the observable represented by M will yield a value\nin the set B, when measured, when the state of the system is represented by W .\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n7\n\nThis connects with von Neumann's operator-theoretic representation of observables in a natural manner, as follows: if f : S \u2192 R is any bounded classical\nreal-valued random variable defined on S, we may define the self-adjoint operator\nR\nAf := S f (s) dM (s)\nin the usual way.5 Then, for any probability measure \u03bc on P(H), we have\nR\nEM \u2217 (\u03bc) (f ) = S f (s) dM \u2217 (\u03bc)(s) = tr(Af W )\nwhere W is the density operator corresponding to \u03bc. This view of quantum mechanics is strikingly powerful. Gleason's theorem, together with the spectral theorem, the classical results of Stone, Wigner, Weyl and von Neumann, and Mackey's\nown work on induced unitary representations, allow one essentially to derive the\nentire apparatus of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (including its unitary dynamics, the CCRs, etc.), from the premise that the logic of experimental propositions is represented by the projection lattice P(H). For an outline of this reconstruction, see [Mackey 1963] or [Beltrametti and Cassinelli 1981]; for a detailed\naccount, see [Varadarajan 1968].\n\n3.2. MACKEY'S AXIOMS\nIts success notwithstanding, Mackey's account of quantum mechanics as a probability calculus still rests on one undeniably ad hoc element: the Hilbert space\nH itself. Indeed, once one entertains the idea that the testable propositions associated with a physical system need not form a Boolean algebra, the door is\nopened to a huge range of other possibilities. It then becomes a matter of urgency\nto understand why nature (or we) should choose to model physical systems in\nterms of projection lattices of Hilbert spaces, rather than anything more general.\nMackey outlined an ambitious programme to do just this, by deducing the Hilbert\nspace model from a set of more primitive and, ideally, more transparently plausible\naxioms for a calculus of events.\nThe framework Mackey adopts is an abstract structure (O, S, p), where O\nis understood to represent the set of real-valued \"observables\" and S the set of\n\"states\" of a physical system. These are connected by a mapping\np : O \u00d7 S \u2192 \u2206 : (A, s) 7\u2192 pA ( * |s) ,\nwhere \u2206 is the set of Borel probability measures on the line. The intended interpretation is that pA ( * |s) gives the statistical distribution of values of a measurement\nof the observable A \u2208 O, when the system is in the state s \u2208 S. We may take the\npair (A, B), where A \u2208 O and B is a real Borel set, to represent the \"experimental\nproposition\" that a measurement of A yields (would yield, has yielded) a value\n5 If\n\nf is P\nnon-negative, then Af is given by the supremum of the operators Ag =\nwhere g = i gi \u03c7Bi is a simple random variable with 0 \u2264 g \u2264 f .\n\nP\n\ni gi M (Bi )\n\n\f8\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nin B. Mackey considers two such propositions equivalent iff they have the same\nprobability in every state - in other words, (A1 , B1 ) and (A2 , B2 ) are equivalent\niff the associated mappings PAi ,Bi := pAi (Bi | * ) are the same. The set L of such\nmappings PA,B , which he calls questions, is Mackey's quantum logic.\nNow, ordered pointwise on S, the set L is an orthocomplemented poset with\nunit 1 given by PA,R for any observable A, whose orthocomplementation is given by\n\u2032\nPA,B\n= 1 \u2212 PA,B = PA,R\\B . Let us say that the questions P, Q \u2208 L are compatible\niff P = PA,B and Q = PA,C for some common observable A and some pair of Borel\nsets B and C. Then we may consider P and Q to be \"simultaneously measurable\".\nFurther, let us say that the questions P, Q \u2208 L are orthogonal (or \"disjoint\", in\nMackey's language) iff P \u2264 Q\u2032 . In this case, we write P \u22a5 Q. Mackey at this\npoint imposes his\nAxiom V : If Pi is any countable family of pairwise orthogonal elements of P , then\nthere exists an element P \u2208 L with P1 + P2 + * * * = P .\nThis axiom guarantees that L is a \u03c3-orthomodular poset - that is, L satisfies the\ntwo conditions\n(a) Any countable family\nW of pairwise orthogonal elements Pi \u2208 L have a join\n(least upper bound) i Pi in L, and\n(b) If P \u2264 Q, then (Q \u2227 P \u2032 ) \u2228 P = Q.\nOn any such poset L, one can define probability measures on L to be mappings\n\u03bc : L \u2192 [0, 1] such that \u03bc(1) = 1Wand, for P\nany countable pairwise orthogonal family\nof elements Pi \u2208 L we have \u03bc( i Pi ) = i \u03bc(Pi ). We can also define, given any\ntwo \u03c3-OMPs L and M , an M -valued measure on L to be a mapping \u03b1 : L \u2192 M\nsuch that \u03b1(1\nW and, for any countable pairwise orthogonal family Pi \u2208 L\nW L ) = 1M\nwe have \u03b1( i Pi ) = i \u03b1(Pi ). For a general discussion of such maps in terms of\nobservables see [Pt\u00e1k 2000]. Returning now to the OMP L of questions, Mackey\nobserves that\n(a) Each state s \u2208 S defines a probability measure sb : L \u2192 [0, 1] by evaluation:\nsb(PA,B ) = PA,B (s) = pA (B|s).\n(b) Each observable A \u2208 O defines an L-valued measure PA : B(R) \u2192 L via\nPA (B) = PA,B on the real Borel sets (which, constituting a \u03c3-Boolean algebra, certainly constitute a \u03c3-OMP).\nConversely, suppose L is any \u03c3-OMP L, and that S is any order-determining\nset of probability measures on L - i.e., \u03bc(p) \u2264 \u03bc(q) for all \u03bc \u2208 S implies that\np \u2264 q. Let O be the set of all L-valued Borel measures on the line, and define\np : O \u00d7 S \u2192 \u2206(R) by p\u03b1 (B|\u03bc) = \u03bc(\u03b1(B)). Then the structure (O, S, p) satisfies\nMackey's axioms, and, furthermore, the OMP of questions constructed from it is\ncanonically isomorphic to L.\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n9\n\nAs remarked by [Foulis 1962; Gudder 1965], Mackey's axioms then define the\ntheory of the following class of structures: pairs (L, \u2206) where L is a \u03c3-OMP and \u2206\nis an order-determining family of probability measures on L. Such pairs (routinely\nreferred to as quantum logics in the mathematical literature in the 1960s and\n1970s) have been studied intensively by many authors. For detailed discussions of\northomodular posets in the quantum logical context see [Beltrametti and Cassinelli\n1981; Gudder 1985; Pt\u00e1k 2000; Pt\u00e1k and Pulmannov\u00e1 1991]. Of course such\nquantum logics are still a far cry from the standard quantum logic P(H). Among\nother things, the orthomodular poset P(H) is a complete lattice: arbitrary joins\nexist, not just countable orthogonal joins. Still, one might hope that a deeper\nanalysis - perhaps involving additional axioms - might lead to a meaningful\ncharacterization, and, ideally, a motivation for the standard quantum logics. This\nwas Mackey's expressed goal:\n\"Ideally, one would like to have a list of physically plausible assumptions from which one could deduce [the Hilbert space model]. Short\nof this, one would like a list from which one could deduce a set of\npossibilities ..., all but one of which could be shown to be inconsistent\nwith suitably planned experiments. At the moment, such lists are not\navailable...\" [Mackey 1963, p.72]\nThis topic lies at the heart of Piron's original axiomatization, to be discussed in\nthe next section. On the other hand, as we shall discuss in sections 5 and 6, the\nautonomous study of such structures leads naturally to further generalizations,\nnotably, to orthoalgebras and effect algebras.\nBefore turning to a rapid survey of some of the major developments which have\noccurred since Mackey's foundational work, let us make a few comments. First,\nand foremost, the major feature which separates Mackey's formalism from current\ntendencies in operational quantum logic is the former's reliance on probability as a\nprimitive concept. While important advances in this context have been made, for\nexample in [Pulmannov\u00e1 1986 a,b; Gudder and Pulmannov\u00e1 1987; Pulmannov\u00e1\nand Gudder 1987], most contemporary work relegates probability to a derived\nnotion.6 This is not to say that statistical states are unimportant in operational\nquantum logic. However, they have passed from the status of a rather vaguely\nconstrued primitive concept to that of a well defined structural tool. Here mention\nmay be made of the characterization of the state spaces of standard quantum\nlogics, culminating in Navara's proof of the independence of the automorphism\ngroup, center, and state space of a quantum logic [Navara 1992].\nA notable exception to this trend is the theory of decision effects introduced\n6 For\n\nexample, while in [Piron 1964 \u00a77] generalized probability is discussed as a useful physical\nheuristic, in [Jauch and Piron 1969 \u00a75] states are defined as maximal sets of actual properties\nof the system. Similarly, while the formalism introduced in [Randall and Foulis 1970; Foulis\nand Randall 1972; Randall and Foulis 1973] is explicitly concerned with operational statistics, in\n[Foulis, Piron and Randall 1983; Randall and Foulis 1983; Foulis, Greechie and R\u00fcttimann 1992,\n1993] emphasis is placed on the conception of states in terms of supports in the outcome space\nassociated to the system.\n\n\f10\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nby G\u00fcnther Ludwig during the revision of his classic text [1954, 1955]. This work\nis based on the classification of macroscopic notions into preparative and effective\nparts which both participate in measurement interactions mediated by action carriers. We shall not enter into the details of Ludwig's axiomatic scheme, successively\nrefined in [Ludwig 1964, 1967, 1968; D\u00e4hn 1968; Mielnik 1968, 1969; Stolz 1969,\n1971; D\u00e4hn 1972; Ludwig 1972] and codified in the monumental treatise [Ludwig\n1985, 1987], but will content ourselves with some general remarks. The primitive\nnotion in this theory is that of a probability relation defined on the Cartesian\nproduct of the set of ensembles and the set of effects, these two sets being taken\nas embedded in a suitable pair of Banach spaces. In some sense, then, the work\nof Ludwig and his collaborators runs parallel to the field of operational quantum\nlogic as we have introduced it, focussing more on the functional analytic structure of the problem than its ordered algebraic aspects. As such it perhaps bears\nmore formal relation to the algebraic quantum theory of Segal [1947] and Haag\nand Kastler [1964] than the operational theories of Piron and Foulis\u2013Randall to be\ndiscussed next. Nevertheless, an important physical feature of Ludwig's work is\nthat it attempts to deal with the notion of non-ideal measurements by exploiting\nsubprojective operators. Note that such operators appear naturally in discussions\nof generalized localisability [Jauch and Piron 1967; Amrein 1969]. For general surveys of the different approaches to operational quantum mechanics see [Gudder\n1977, 1979, 1981; Ludwig and Neumann 1981], for a detailed analysis of the model\nrelationship between the approaches of Piron and Ludwig see [Cattaneo and Laudisa 1994; Cattaneo and Nistic\u00f2 1993], and for an overview of the application of\nPOV-measures to questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics see [Busch,\nLahti and Mittelstaedt 1991; Schroeck 1996].\n\n4. The work of Piron\nSignificant progress at both ends of the problem of completing and extending\nMackey's programme was made by Constantin Piron [1964] and further developed\nin what has become known as the Geneva School approach to quantum physics.\nPiron characterized abstractly those complete orthomodular lattices representable\nas the lattices of closed subspaces of generalized Hilbert spaces. He also supplied\na deep analysis of the basic physical ideas of quantum mechanics that helped to\nmotivate the assumptions needed in his representation theorem as reasonable, general axioms. In this section we describe a formalized version of these axioms in the\nspirit of [Piron 1976], before making some remarks on more recent developments.\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n11\n\n4.1. THE REPRESENTATION THEOREM\nThe projection lattice P(H) has a much more regular structure than the general\nOMP provided by Mackey's axioms. In particular, P(H)\n(a) is a complete lattice - that is, the meet and join of any subset of L exist,\n(b) is atomistic - that is, every element of P(H) is the join of the atoms (here,\nthe one-dimensional projections) beneath it,\n(c) satisfies the atomic covering law: if P \u2208 P(H) is an atom and Q \u2208 P(H) is\narbitrary, then P \u2228Q covers Q, i.e., is an atom in the lattice {M \u2208 L|Q \u2264 M },\n(d) is irreducible - that is, it cannot be factored as a non-trivial direct product.\nEquivalently, no element of P(H), other than 0 and 1, commutes with all\nother elements.7\nIn his thesis [Piron 1964], Piron proved a partial converse, namely that all such\nlattices (of sufficient length) L may be realised as the set of biorthogonal subspaces\nof a generalized Hilbert space. Explicitly, by considering the (essentially) unique\nmeet and atom preserving embedding of L in a projective geometry, and exploiting\nthe standard vector space realization of projective geometries of dimension at least\nthree, he showed that the image of the original lattice could be characterised by a\ndefinite hermitian form.8\nNow, for an arbitrary inner product space V , the complete atomistic ortholattice L(V ) of biorthogonal subspaces need not be orthomodular. When it is, V\nis termed a generalized Hilbert space. This terminology is motivated by another\nstriking result, namely that if V is an inner product space over one of the standard\ndivision rings (i.e., R, C or H), then L(V ) is orthomodular iff V is complete. This\nwas first proved by Piron, using a hypothesis on measure extensions which turned\nout to be independent of ZF set theory; under prompting by Stone, a geometric\n7 Of course, not every quantum mechanical system is irreducible, but in general decomposes\ninto a family of purely quantum systems indexed by superselection rules. For example, [Piron\n1964] shows that each orthomodular lattice satisfying axioms (a)\u2013(c) is the direct union of a\nfamily of irreducible lattices, its corresponding projective geometry being the direct union of the\ncorresponding geometries. Abstractly, systems with discrete superselection rules may be treated\nby taking projection-valued measures with values in an appropriate von Neumann algebra A. If\nthe induced orthomodular lattice L(A) does not contain a summand of type I2 then Gleason's\ntheorem continues to apply: every \u03c3-additive probability measure on L(A) extends uniquely to\na normal state on A [Christensen 1982; Yeadon 1983]. For further discussion see, for example,\n[Bunce and Hamhalter 1994; Bunce and Wright 1994; Hamhalter 1993, 1995].\n8 This development has become much more physically transparent and mathematically elegant\nsince the seminal work of Faure and Fr\u00f6licher [1993, 1994, 1995], where the construction of\nlinear representations for projective geometries and their morphisms is carried through in a\ncategorically natural manner. For example, an orthogonality relation determines a morphism\nfrom the projective geometry to its dual and so a quasilinear map from the underlying vector\nspace to its dual. In this way the inner product of quantum mechanics finds a rigorous and neat\nfoundation.\n\n\f12\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nproof was later obtained by Amemiya and Araki [1965].9 Finally, let us remark\nthat the Geneva School formalism that was inspired by this theorem has been\nextensively applied to several problems of a more or less concrete nature, for example, symmetries [Emch and Piron 1962, 1963], superselection rules [Piron 1965,\n1969], observables [Piron 1971; Giovannini and Piron 1979; Giovannini 1981a,b,c],\nthe a priori probability [Piron 1972], and irreversible processes [Gisin and Piron\n1981; Gisin 1981, 1982a,b, 1983a,b].\n\n4.2. PIRON'S AXIOMS\nMackey's axioms produce only a \u03c3-complete orthomodular poset L - a far cry\nfrom the complete, atomistic OML figuring in Piron's Theorem. Piron was able to\nmotivate the necessary extra structure in the context of an axiomatic framework\nsimilar to Mackey's, but differing from it in taking as basic not the concept of\nprobability, but a concept of physical property based on the certainty of obtaining\nan experimental outcome. Here Piron consciously exploits the work of Dirac [1930\n\u00a71.2], who gives an operational discussion of light polarisation in terms of the certainty or otherwise of passage through an appropriate crystal, and the conception\nof Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [1935] that elements of reality are sufficient conditions that one be able to predict a physical quantity with certainty and without\ndisturbing the system.\nPiron begins with a primitive set Q of questions - understood to represent\ndefinite experimental projects having just two possible outcomes, which we designate as yes and no. For ease of presentation let us consider given a set P of\npreparation procedures.10 For P \u2208 P and \u03b1 \u2208 Q we write P \u000f \u03b1 to indicate that\nthe preparation P is such that the answer to the question \u03b1 can be predicted with\ncertainty to be yes. We can then associate, to every question \u03b1, the proposition\n[\u03b1] = { P \u2208 P | P \u000f \u03b1 } .\nLet L := { [\u03b1] | \u03b1 \u2208 Q } be the set of all such propositions, considered as a poset\nunder set inclusion. Note that [\u03b1] \u2286 [\u03b2] iff every preparation making \u03b1 certain\nalso makes \u03b2 certain. Piron proceeds to adduce several axioms the force of which\nis to make L a complete, atomistic OML satisfying the covering law.\nL is a complete lattice The first, and probably the most novel, of these axioms\n9 Note that necessary and sufficient conditions for the underlying division ring to be standard\nhave recently been found - one of the simplest statements in the infinite dimensional case being\nthat the vector space admit an infinite orthonormal sequence [Sol\u00e8r 1995; Holland 1995; Prestel\n1995]; for an example of a nonstandard generalized Hilbert space see [Keller 1980], for a detailed\ndiscussion of the geometry of generalized Hilbert spaces see [Gross 1979, 1990], and for a survey\nof other completeness results see [Dvure\u010denskij 1992].\n10 Note that this is not strictly necessary, but is just an expedient to avoid locutions such as 'if\nthe system is, or has been prepared, in such a way that . . . '. Similarly, the usual identification\nof propositions with equivalence classes of questions is made for ease of exposition and should\nnot be taken too seriously as a definition.\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n13\n\ninvolves the notion of a product question. Given a non-empty set A of questions, their product is the question \u03b1 = \u03a0A defined as follows: to pose \u03b1, one\nselects, in any way one will, a question \u03b2 \u2208 A and, posing this question, attributes\nto \u03b1 the answer obtained. Piron's first axiom requires that Q be closed under\nthe formation\nof arbitrary product questions. A moment's reflection reveals that\nT\n[\u03a0A] = \u03b2\u2208A [\u03b2]. Hence, L is closed under arbitrary intersections and thus a\ncomplete lattice.11\nOrthocomplementation If \u03b1 is any question, we may define an inverse question\n\u03b1\u223c by interchanging the roles of yes and no. Piron requires that Q be closed under\nthe formation of inverses. The intended interpretation requires us to suppose that\n[\u03b1] \u2229 [\u03b1\u223c ] = \u2205. In order to secure an orthocomplementation on L, Piron introduces\nanother axiom, namely, that for any question \u03b1, there exists some compatible\ncomplement \u03b2 \u2208 [\u03b1] satisfying [\u03b2 \u223c ] \u2228 [\u03b1] = 1.12\nOrthomodularity On the face of it, this does not rule out the possibility that\nthere may exist several inequivalent compatible complements for a given \u03b1. However, this is remedied by a third axiom, Piron's\nAxiom P : If b < c and b\u2032 and c\u2032 are compatible complements for b and c, respectively, then the sub-lattice of L generated by b, b\u2032 , c, c\u2032 is distributive.\nIt follows that compatible complements are unique, thereby defining an orthocomplementation. Moreover, Axiom P dictates that L be orthomodular: if b < c, then\n(c \u2227 b\u2032 ) \u2228 b = c by the distributivity of {b, c, b\u2032, c\u2032 }.\nAtomicity and the Covering Law Piron enforces the atomicity of the lattice\nwith an ad-hoc axiom (A1) requiring that L be atomic - i.e., every element\ndominates at least one atom. The covering law is also imposed directly (as axiom\nA2), but with some substantial motivation, as follows. Let us denote by \u03a3L the\nset of atoms of L. Now, in any orthocomplemented poset L, the Sasaki mapping\n\u03c6 : L \u00d7 L \u2192 L is given by \u03c6(a, b) = b \u2227 (b\u2032 \u2228 a). If b is fixed, we write \u03c6b : L \u2192 L\nfor the mapping \u03c6b (a) = \u03c6(a, b) = b \u2227 (b\u2032 \u2228 a). Note that L is orthomodular iff\n\u03c6b (a) = a for all a \u2264 b, in which case \u03c6b (a) \u2228 b\u2032 = a \u2228 b\u2032 . Using these remarks,\nit is not hard to prove that an OML L satisfies the atomic covering law iff, for\nall a \u2208 L, we have a \u2208 \u03a3L &b 6\u22a5 a \u21d2 \u03c6b (a) \u2208 \u03a3L . We then have an alternative\nformulation of the covering law, namely, that Sasaki projections map atoms either\nto atoms, or to 0.\nPiron defines the state of the system to be the set of all propositions p = [\u03b1]\n11 The product operation was first introduced in [Jauch and Piron 1969]. Earlier, the meet had\nbeen introduced via either semantic conjunction [Piron 1964] or limit filters [Jauch 1968].\n12 The fact that an axiom must be postulated guaranteeing the existence of an orthocomplementation is due to the fact that the inverses of equivalent questions need not themselves be\nequivalent. For example, 0 * I = 0 however (0 * I)\u223c = 0\u223c * I \u223c = I * 0 = 0 and 0\u223c = I. For a\ndiscussion of some confusions on this point see [Foulis and Randall 1984].\n\n\f14\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nthat are certain (at a given time, in a given situation). We naturally require that\nthe state be closed under intersection and enlargement, i.e., that it be a complete\nfilter in the lattice L. Such a filter is principal, and is generated by an atom.\nHence, states may be represented by atoms.13 Finally, call a, b in L compatible iff\n{a, b, a\u2032 , b\u2032 } is distributive, iff \u03c6b (a) = a \u2227 b. Piron calls the question\n(a) ideal iff every proposition compatible with [\u03b1] that is certain before a measurement of \u03b1 is also certain again afterwards when the result of that measurement is yes.\n(b) first-kind iff the answer to \u03b1 immediately after securing the answer yes is\ncertain to be again yes.\nIn the presence of axiom A2 (i.e., the covering law), one can then prove that, for\n\u03b2 an ideal first-kind measurement of b \u2208 L, if a is the state before measurement,\nthen the state after securing yes upon measurement of \u03b1 is \u03c6b (a).\nMany people have found the physical reasoning that motivates Piron's axioms\ncompelling. However, this framework turns out to have some sharp limitations. In\nparticular, a system consisting of two \"separated\" systems, in the sense of Aerts\n[1981, 1982], each of which individually obeys Piron's axioms, will as a whole conform to these axioms if and only if one of the systems is classical. To prove this key\nresult, Aerts exploited the notion of an orthogonality relation, where two states\nare orthogonal if there exists a question which is certain for the first and impossible for the second. The use of this relation has become central in more recent\naxiomatizations of the Geneva School approach, such as [Piron 1990; Moore 1999].\nFor a detailed analysis see [Valckenborgh 2000]. Note that in these works attention is focussed on complete atomistic ortholattices as models for the most direct\naxiomatizations based on the physical duality between the state and property descriptions of a physical system. Somewhat paradoxically, then, Piron's approach\nkeeps one axiom rejected in the OMP approach - namely completeness - and\nrejects another which the latter keeps - namely (some form of) orthomodularity.\nAs we shall see in the next section, this cleavage is symptomatic of the fact that\none should distinguish conceptually the property lattice of a system from its logic,\neven when they turn out to be isomorphic.\n\n5. The work of Foulis and Randall\nContemporary with these developments was the work of Dave Foulis and the late\nCharlie Randall on empirical logic, a happy synthesis of ideas coming from their\nrespective doctoral dissertations, on abstract lattice theory [Foulis 1958] and concrete operational statistics [Randall 1966]. Not only does this formalism provide\n13 Conversely, if p 6= 0, then p = [\u03b1] where \u03b1 is a question that is certain for at least one preparation. Hence, there exists at least one state (i.e., any state compatible with that preparation)\nthat contains p. Hence, there must be sufficiently many states so that for every p \u2208 L, there is\na state/atom a \u2264 p. But this easily implies that every atom is a state. Thus, states correspond\nexactly to atoms of L.\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n15\n\na powerful general heuristic, but as we shall see it has also laid the ground for\nseveral of the purely mathematical developments to be discussed in the following.\n\n5.1. TEST SPACES\nBoth Mackey and Piron begin with a primitive structure in which experimental\npropositions of the form \"observable A takes value in set B\" are unrelated for distinct observables. In effect, each observable A is associated with a Boolean algebra\nBA of possible events (isomorphic to the Borel field in Mackey's scheme, and to\n{0, 1} in Piron's), these Boolean algebras being initially disjoint from one another.\nIdentifications are then made between the Boolean algebras corresponding to different observables. In Mackey's scheme, the primitive propositions (A1 , B1 ) and\n(A2 , B2 ) are identified iff they are equiprobable in every state; in Piron's, iff they\nare certain in exactly the same situations. Both approaches to the construction of\nquantum logics have been the object of some criticism. In particular, as a number\nof authors point out, both become problematic when one considers compound or\niterated measurements.14\nIn a long series of papers (e.g., [Foulis and Randall 1972, 1974, 1978, 1981a;\nRandall and Foulis 1970, 1973, 1978, 1983a]), Foulis and Randall developed an\nextensive theory \u2013 which they termed empirical logic - in which such identifications are given a priori, with no prior reference to any concept of state or property.\nTheir formalism is based on the primitive notion of an operation or test - that\nis, a definite set of mutually exclusive alternative possible outcomes. The FoulisRandall theory focusses on test spaces, i.e., collections A of overlapping tests. The\nidentification of outcomes between distinct tests is understood to be given, i.e.,\nFoulis and Randall lay\nS down no doctrine as to how such identifications must be\nmade. Letting X = A stand for the outcome spacePof A, a statistical state on A\nis defined to be a mapping \u03c9 : X \u2192 [0, 1] such that x\u2208E \u03c9(x) = 1 for every test\nE \u2208 A, and a realistic state is represented [Foulis, Piron and Randall 1983] by a\ncertain kind of subset of X called a support, representing the totality of outcomes\npossible in that state. Note that, quite apart from its own merits, this notion can\nbe used to give a perspicuous mathematical treatment of Piron's axiomatics; see\n[Randall and Foulis 1983b] and [Wilce 1997].\nA number of algebraic, analytic and order-theoretic objects can be attached to\na test space A, each serving in a slightly different way as a sort of \"logic\". Under\nsimple normative conditions on the combinatorial structure of A, these turn out\nto coincide with more familiar structures. In particular, if A is \"algebraic\",15\none can construct from the events of A a rather well-behaved ordered partial\n14 A simple example is offered in [Cooke and Hilgevoord 1981]. The point is a familiar one -\neven in orthodox Hilbert space quantum mechanics, one must keep track of phase relations in\ndiscussing iterated experiments, and these are lost when one identifies experimental propositions\naccording to either the Mackey or the Piron scheme.\n15 A test space is algebraic if any two elements sharing a common complement share exactly\nthe same complements, where A and B are complements if they are disjoint and A \u222a B is a test.\n\n\f16\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nalgebraic structure \u03a0(A), called an orthoalgebra. These can be defined abstractly:\nan orthoalgebra is a pair (L, \u2295) where L is a set and \u2295 is a commutative, associative\npartial binary operation on L satisfying the three additional conditions:\n(a) There exists a neutral element 0 \u2208 L such that, for every p \u2208 L, p \u2295 0 = p,\n(b) There exists a unit element 1 \u2208 L such that, for every p \u2208 L, there is a\nunique q \u2208 L with p \u2295 q = 1,\n(c) If p \u2295 p exists, then p = 0.\nOrthoalgebras then generalize orthomodular posets, which can be defined as orthoalgebras in which, given that p \u2295 q, q \u2295 r and r \u2295 p all exist, the element\np \u2295 q \u2295 r also exists. This axiom, called orthocoherence, is in fact a finitistic version of Mackey's axiom V. Conversely, dropping condition (c) we obtain what is\ncalled an effect algebra, called generalized orthoalgebras by [Giuntini and Greuling\n1989] and D-posets by [K\u00f4pka 1992].\n\n5.2. ORTHOALGEBRAS\nOrthoalgebras and effect algebras are sufficiently regular objects to have an interesting mathematical theory (one that is only beginning to be explored). In\nparticular, nearly all of the conceptual apparatus of OMP-based quantum logic,\nsuch as centers [Greechie, Foulis and Pulmannov\u00e1 1995] and Sasaki projections\n[Bennett and Foulis 1998; Wilce 2000], can be rather easily extended to this more\ngeneral context. On the other hand, because of their simplicity, test spaces are\noften much easier to manipulate than their associated \"logics\". They also have\nthe heuristic advantage that the operational interpretation is, so to say, right on\nthe surface, with the logics serving only as useful invariants. In particular, while\nit is completely straightforward to combine test spaces sequentially, the various\n\"logics\" rarely respect such combinations. Finally, if A is algebraic, there exists a\ncanonical order-preserving mapping L \u2192 L from the logic of A into the property\nlattice associated with any entity (A, \u03a3) over A. In both classical and quantum\nmechanical examples, this mapping is in fact an isomorphism, so that L inherits\nfrom L the structure of a complete lattice, and L inherits from L an orthocomplementation and orthomodularity. This isomorphism is, however, the exception\nrather than the rule. As stressed by [Foulis, Piron and Randall 1983], the tendency\nto identify L and L \u2013 even when they are isomorphic - has caused a great deal\nof unnecessary confusion in discussions of the foundations and interpretation of\nquantum mechanics.\nBesides its awkwardness in dealing with sequential measurements, another\ndifficulty that arises with the Mackey scheme of quantum logic, again recognized\nfirst by Foulis and Randall [1979], is that it is not stable under the formation of\nany reasonable sort of tensor product. Given quantum logics (L, \u2206) and (L\u2032 , \u2206\u2032 ),\neach understood to represent some \"physical\" system, one wants to construct a\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n17\n\nmodel (M, \u0393) of the coupled system in which L and L\u2032 may display correlations,\nbut do not directly interact. Minimal requirements would be that\n(a) there exists a map L \u00d7 L\u2032 \u2192 M carrying p, q to some representative proposition p \u2297 q \u2208 M , and\n(b) for every pair of states \u03bc \u2208 \u2206, \u03bd \u2208 \u2206\u2032 , we be able to form a state \u03bc \u2297 \u03bd \u2208 \u0393\nsuch that (\u03bc \u2297 \u03bd)(p \u2297 q) = \u03bc(p)\u03bd(q).\nHowever, Foulis and Randall produce a simple example showing that this is in\ngeneral impossible: a small, finite OML L with a full set of states such that no\nsuch \"tensor product\" exists for two copies of L.\nThe culprit turns out to be Mackey's Axiom V - or, more precisely, orthocoherence. Indeed, one can show, under the very mild assumption that the\northoalgebras involved each carry a unital family of states, that tensor products of\northoalgebras can be formed in such a way that desiderata (a) and (b) are satisfied\n[Foulis and Randall 1981b; Randall and Foulis 1981]. However, as the example\njust discussed illustrates, orthocoherence is not stable under this tensor product.\nCombining these results with the above mentioned negative results of Aerts for\nproperty lattices, what emerges is that the isomorphism between logic and property lattice, characteristic of both quantum and classical systems, breaks down\nwhen one forms tensor products unless the systems in question are classical. This\nis not to say that the results were entirely negative. Later research into the structure of tensor products [Kl\u00e4y, Randall and Foulis 1987; Golfin 1987; Wilce 1990,\n1992; Bennett and Foulis 1993; Dvure\u010denskij and Pulmannov\u00e1 1994; Dvure\u010denskij\n1995] revealed that Foulis\u2013Randall tensor products of quantum-mechanical entities, while no longer strictly quantum, still retain a rich geometric structure.\nThese results gave substantial impetus to the study of orthoalgebras, test\nspaces and other structures more general than those considered by Mackey and\nPiron (some of which will be discussed below). The theory of test spaces, in\nparticular, has developed in several directions in the past decade. A number\nof authors (e.g., [Dvure\u010denskij and Pulmannov\u00e1 1994b; Pulmannov\u00e1 and Wilce\n1995; Gudder 1997]) have discussed generalized test spaces in which outcomes are\npermitted to occur with some multiplicity or intensity, and have used these to\nprovide an operational semantics for effect algebras that parallels the test-space\nsemantics for orthoalgebras. Measure theory on orthoalgebras has been discussed\nby [Habil 1993]. Nishimura [1993, 1995] has generalized the idea of a test space by\nreplacing discrete outcome sets by complete Boolean algebras and locales. [Wilce\n2000] gives an up-to-date survey of the Foulis-Randall theory; for a personal view\nof the historical development of this strand of operational quantum logic see [Foulis\n1998, 1999].\n6. Orthomodular structures\nThus far, we have focussed on quantum logic as a foundational or interpretive\n\n\f18\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\nprogramme in physics. But the subject has other, quite independent roots in pure\nmathematics. Von Neumann himself had stressed the importance of order theoretic methods in studying infinite-dimensional analogues of projective geometry.\nLoomis [1955] and Maeda [1955] independently recognized that a fair bit of the\ndimension theory of von Neumann algebras could be carried over into a purely\nlattice-theoretic setting, namely, that of an orthomodular lattice equipped with a\nsuitable equivalence relation. This stimulated a number of mathematicians to begin investigating orthomodular lattices in abstracto. It soon became apparent that\nsuch lattices occur with some naturality in a wide range of mathematical contexts.\nIf (S, \u2217) is any involutive semigroup, call an element e \u2208 S satisfying p = p2 = p\u2217\na projection. If S contains a (two-sided) zero element, the right annihilator of\nx \u2208 S is the right ideal { a \u2208 S | ax = 0 }. Foulis [1958, 1960, 1962] defined a Baer\n*-semigroup to be an involutive semigroup S with zero having the property that\nthe right-annihilator of any element x \u2208 S is the right ideal generated by a (necessarily, unique) projection x\u2032 . He showed that the set L(S) of closed projections\np = p\u2032\u2032 in S always forms an orthomodular lattice. Conversely, every orthomodular\nlattice can be represented as L(S) for some Baer *-semigroup. Indeed, while this\nrepresentation is not unique, there is a canonical choice for S, namely the semigroup S(L) of residuated self-mappings of L, i.e., mappings \u03c6 : L \u2192 L for which\nthere exists a mapping \u03c8 : L \u2192 L satisfying \u03c8(x) \u2264 y \u2032 \u21d4 x \u2264 \u03c6(y)\u2032 . Among\nthese mappings are the Sasaki projections \u03c6b , discussed in section 4, which turn\nout to be exactly the closed projections in S(L).\nOver the following decades, a substantial pure theory of orthomodular lattices\nwas developed by Foulis and others. The state of this theory as of the early 1980s\nis represented by the book of Kalmbach [1983]. [Bruns and Harding 2000] discuss\nmore recent developments, of which there have been many. Particularly striking\nis the recent discovery of Harding [1996, 1998] that one can organize the set of\ndirect-product decompositions of essentially any algebraic object into an orthomodular poset. On the other hand, the on-going work on Mackey's programme\nalso produced a variety of structures more general than orthomodular lattices and\nposets - orthoalgebras, the still more general effect algebras, and, in a different\ndirection, the partial Boolean algebras of Kochen and Specker [1967]. All of these\nare primarily partial algebraic, and only secondarily order theoretic, objects. All\nhave attracted, especially during the past few years, significant mathematical interest.16 The theory of effect algebras, much of which is due to the pioneering work\nof Foulis and the late M. K. Bennett [Bennett and Foulis, 1995, 1997; Foulis and\nBennett 1994], continues to develop rapidly. Of particular interest here is their\nrecent reformulation of a large part of the theory of effect algebras (and thus, of\nquantum logic) as a branch of the theory of ordered abelian groups, also discussed\nin [Foulis, Bennett and Greechie 1996; Foulis, Greechie and Bennett 1998; Wilce\n1995, 1998]. This is the subject of [Foulis 2000].\nFinally, orthomodular lattices have also been studied in detail in the purely\n16 One notable result is that of Kochen and Conway [Kochen 1996], that very small sets of\nprojections in P(H) generate a partial Boolean algebra that is dense in the full projection lattice.\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n19\n\nlogical context, and in particular the possibility of defining reasonable implication connectives. One of the basic results in this direction is that of Kalmbach [1974] who, exploiting the characterisation of free orthomodular lattices on\ntwo generators [Bruns and Kalmbach 1973], was able to show that there are exactly five lattice polynomials a \u2192 b satisfying the primitive implicative condition\na \u2264 b \u21d4 (a \u2192 b) = 1. Note that here orthomodularity is essential, a simple\nconsideration of the non-orthomodular \"benzene ring\" showing that such connectives do not exist in the non-orthomodular case [Moore 1993]. For an analysis of\nthe weaker exportation condition a \u2264 b \u21d2 (a \u2192 b) = 1 conjoined with modus\nponens see [Herman, Marsden and Piziak 1975], and for a detailed investigation of\nthe deduction theorem see Malinowski [1990, 1992]. On the other hand, defining\na Kripkean accessibility relation induced from non-orthogonality, an idea having\nits origins in Foulis and Randall's work on lexicographic orthogonality [1971], has\nallowed the introduction of modal quantum logic [Dalla Chiara 1977, 1983; Goldblatt 1974, 1975]. Of course there has been much other work on implications in\nquantum logic; for general overviews see, for example, [Dalla Chiara 1986; van\nFraassen 1981; Hardegree and Frazer 1981].\n\n7. Dynamical, categorical and computational aspects\nWe close by considering the categorical reformulation of the basic notions of order structures and its application to operational quantum theory, a subject with\nstrong links to various recent developments in enriched category theory and computational semantics. The basic tool of this theory is that of pairs f \u22a3 g , where\nf : L \u2192 M and g : M \u2192 L are isotone maps between posets, satisfying the\nadjunction condition f (a) \u2264 b \u21d4 a \u2264 g(b) . For a pedestrian development of the\ntheory of adjunctions with a particular focus on its operational applications we\nrefer to [Coecke and Moore 2000]. It is amusing to note that this notion may\nbe used to shed some light on Birkhoff and von Neumann's remark cited above\nthat while philosophers have tended to focus on the nature of negation in nonclassical logics, the study of quantum mechanics highlights the distributive law as\nthe weak link in operational quantum logic. To see this, let us note that Heyting\nalgebras, considered as models for intuitionistic logic, may be defined as those lattices admitting an implication connection \u2192 satisfying the adjunction condition\n(x \u2227 a) \u2264 b \u21d4 x \u2264 (a \u2192 b) [Birkhoff 1940 \u00a7161; Birkhoff 1942 \u00a727]. Since the condition f \u22a3 g implies that f preserves existing joins and g preserves existing meets,\nany Heyting algebra is distributive. On the other hand, much of the structure\ntheory of orthomodular lattices rests on the so-called Sasaki adjunction \u03c6a \u22a3 \u03c6a ,\nwhere\n\u03c6a (x) = a \u2227 (a\u2032 \u2228 x) and \u03c6a (x) = a\u2032 \u2228 (a \u2227 x)\n[Nakamura 1957; Sasaki 1955]. In a certain sense, then, we may consider Heyting algebras as a class of distributive lattices where those elements possessing a\ncomplement may be simply characterised, and orthomodular lattices as a class of\northolattices where the set of complements of any given element may be simply\n\n\f20\n\nCOECKE, MOORE AND WILCE\n\ncomputed. For discussions of Heyting algebras and the more general semicomplemented lattices, see [Curry 1963; Frink 1962; K\u00f6hler 1981; Nemitz 1965].\nOne of the earliest, and most important, applications of residuations in orthomodular lattices was Foulis' pioneering work on Baer \u2217 -semigroups, described\nabove. This research has not only led to a deeper understanding of the notion of\nresiduation [Blyth and Janowitz 1972; Derd\u00e9rian 1967], but was also crucial in the\ndevelopment of dynamical aspects of operational quantum logic. One of the first of\nthese developments was the work of Pool [1968a,b], who sought a phenomenological interpretation of Baer \u2217 -semigroups via the notion of conditional probability\nsupplied by the conventional quantum theory of measurement. A more distinctly\noperational approach to evolutions in general was provided by Daniel [1982, 1989]\nand extended by Faure, Moore and Piron [1995], the latter leading to a general\nstudy of the categories of state spaces and property lattices [Moore 1995, 1997].\nHere an externally imposed evolution is modeled by pulling back definite experimental projects defined at the final time to their images defined at the initial\ntime. By physical arguments, this map must preserve the product operation and\nso the lattice meet. Hence, under suitable stability conditions, its join preserving left adjoint then describes the propagation of the state of the system. These\nobservations have been generalized by Amira, Coecke and Stubbe [1998], who explicate the structure of operational tests derived from the notions of free choice\nand composition. Note that the latter of these notions in particular plays a fundamental role in the heuristics of Foulis and Randall mentioned above. Finally,\nthe abstract structure of operational resolutions has been analysed by Coecke and\nStubbe [1999a,b, 2000], allowing, for example, an analysis of the physical notions\nof compoundness [Coecke 2000] and the duality between causality and propagation\n[Coecke, Moore and Stubbe 2000].\nMathematically, the structure induced from operational resolutions is that of\na quantaloid, namely a category whose Hom-sets are join complete lattices such\nthat composition distributes on both sides over joins.17 One thus obtains a simple\nexample of an enriched category, in which Hom-sets are objects in some base category and composition is realised by natural transformations satisfying coherence\ncriteria. This has become a central notion in category theory, and is treated in the\nstandard text [Borceux 1994]; for a specialised treatment see [Kelly 1982] and for\na pedagogical development see [Borceux and Stubbe 2000]. Restricting attention\nto categories with a single object, we then recover quantales, introduced by Mulvey [1986] as a non-commutative generalization of locales.18 Here mention may\nbe made of the recent extension of the localic notions of simplicity and spatiality\nto the context of quantales [Kruml 2000; Paseka 1997; Paseka and Kruml 2000;\n17 The name quantaloid was introduced by Rosenthal [1991], although much of the basic conceptual development had already been made by Joyal and Tierney [1984] and Pitts [1988] in their\nstudies of Grothendieck topoi.\n18 Note that historical precedents for these notions can be traced back to the work of Ward\nand Dilworth [Ward 1937, 1938; Ward and Dilworth 1939a,b], who used such multiplications\nto study ideals in rings, a technique which has recently been applied to non-commutative C\u2217 algebras [Borceux, Rosick\u00fd and Van Den Bossche 1989; Rosick\u00fd 1989].\n\n\fOPERATIONAL QUANTUM LOGIC: AN OVERVIEW\n\n21\n\nRosick\u00fd 1995], a subject treated in some detail in [Paseka and Rosick\u00fd 2000]. It is\ninteresting to observe that similar structures have also been exploited in computer\nscience. An important example is the so-called observational logic of Abramsky\nand Vickers [Abramsky 1991; Abramsky and Vickers 1993; Vickers 1989]. Here it\nis observed that the possibility that observation induces a change of state formally\nleads to a passage from frames to quantales. This line of thought has been extended by Resende [1999, 2000], who describes general systems on the basis of their\nobservable behaviour independently of any supposed state space. For an overview\nsee the [Resende 2000]. It should be noted, however, that these considerations\nare rather different from the contemporary notion of quantum computation (see\nfor example [Gudder 2000]'s general theory of quantum languages, i.e., languages\naccepted by quantum automata).\n\nReferences\n[1] Abramsky, S.
