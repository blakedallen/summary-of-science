Bose-Einstein correlations in multiple particle production processes\nare a field of intense study. For recent reviews see [1]-[4]. An important\nsubfield is the study of multiparticle effects on multiplicity and momenta\ndistributions. Here exactly soluble models are a convenient starting point.\nA soluble model, which is particularly popular, is the Gaussian model [5] [13]. In this model all the integrations are Gaussian and consequently can\nbe performed analytically.

For simplicity we start with\nthe one-dimensional case. In the Gaussian model the transition to three\ndimensions is trivial. It is seen that the integrals Gn are Gaussian and consequently can be performed analytically. One needs, however, a closed formula\nvalid for any n. This is more difficult to obtain. Zim\u00e1nyi and Cs\u00f6rg\u00f6 [6, 7]\nfollowing some suggestions from Pratt [5] constructed a system of recurrence\nrelations for three series of parameters and after a rather lengthy calculation\ngot a formula for the integrals, which can be written in a fairly simple form\n[12]. Wiedemann [13] applied successfully the MATHEMATICA program directly to the integrals Gn . In the present note we point out that a very short\nderivation of the formula for the integrals Gn can be given, if a mathematical\nidentity for Hermite polynomials is made use of. This work is an extension\nof the method used in [8, 9].\n2. An identity, valid for |z| < 12 , is\nK=\n\nzn\nz(x2 + y 2 ) \u2212 xy\n1\n\u03a6(x, y, z) \u2261\nexp\n\u22124z\n.\nHn (x)Hn (y) = \u221a\n1 \u2212 4z 2\n1 \u2212 4z 2\nn=0 n!\n(4)\nA convenient starting point to check this formula is the definition of the\nHermite polynomials in the form [14]1\n\"\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2n\nHn (z) = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n2\n\n(z + it)n e\u2212t dt.\n\n#\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nAfter substituting it into (4) the summation over n gives an exponential and\nit is enough to perform a double Gaussian integral to get the right-hand side.\nThe function \u03a6(x, y, z) is defined by this formula.\n3.

In order to check the formula it is enough to expand the binomial into powers of z,\nintegrate term by term and compare the coefficients with the formulae given in [15].\n\n2\n\n\fthe function\n\u03c1(p, p\u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c8n (p)\u03bbn \u03c8n\u2217 (p\u2032 )\n\n(7)\n\nn\n\ncan be interpreted as a well-defined single-particle density matrix in the momentum representation. The functions \u03c8n are its eigenfunctions and the\nnumbers \u03bbn are the corresponding eigenvalues. Let us choose in particular\nfor the functions \u03c8n the energy eigenfunctions in the momentum representation of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and for the numbers \u03bbn a\ngeometric progression [8, 9]:\n\n\u03c8n (p) =\n\ns\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1 2 p2\n\u221a n exp \u2212\nHn (\u03b1p);\n\u03c02 n!\n2\n#\n\n\"\n\n\u03bbn = (1 \u2212 z)z n .\n\n(8)\n\nIt is assumed here that |z| < 1, so that the eigenvalues \u03bbn are correctly\nnormalized. The parameter \u03b1 is positive. Its interpretation in terms of the\nmechanical parameters of the oscillator is of no importance here. This choice\ncorresponds to a single particle density matrix which using (4) can be written\nin the form\nz\n\u03b1(1 \u2212 z) \u2212 1 \u03b12 (p2 +p\u20322 )\n\u221a\n(9)\n\u03a6(\u03b1p, \u03b1p\u2032, ),\ne 2\n\u03c0\n2\nor substituting the definition of the function \u03a6 and replacing the parameters\np, p\u2032 by the parameters K, q according to (3)\n\u03c1(p, p\u2032 ) =\n\n\u03b1\n\u03c1(K, q) = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\ns\n\n1\u2212z\n1 \u2212 z \u03b12 q 2 1 + z\n.\nexp \u2212\u03b12 K 2\n\u2212\n1+z\n1+z\n4 1\u2212z\n#\n\n\"\n\n(10)\n\nThis density matrix differs only by notation from the density matrix (2). The\ncorrespondence between the parameters is\ns\n\nv\u22121\nR\n;\nz=\n.\n\u2206\nv+1\nFollowing [12] we have introduced the notation\n\u03b1=\n\nv = 2\u2206R \u2265 1,\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the inequality follows from the uncertainty principle.\n4. In order to calculate the function Gn (p, p\u2032 ) let us note first that it is the\np, p\u2032 matrix element of the n-th power of the matrix \u03c1. Therefore, it has the\nsame eigenfunctions and its eigenvalues are n-th powers of the corresponding\neigenvalues of matrix \u03c1.

Let us add some comments.\n\n\u2022 As mentioned, the transition from the one-dimensional case to d-dimensions\nis very simple. The density matrix (2) gets replaced by a product\nd\nY\n\n1\nK2\nq\n\u03c1(~p, p~\u2032 ) =\nexp \u2212 i 2 \u2212 Ri2 q 2 .\n2\u2206i\n2\n2\u03c0\u22062i\ni=1\n\"\n\n1\n\n#\n\n(18)\n\nConsequently, the integrals Gm from (1) factorize and one obtains for\neach Gm a product of expressions (15), in general with different values\nof \u22062 and v for each factor.\n\u2022 For the harmonic oscillator the energy eigenfunctions in the momentum\nrepresentation and in the coordinate representation have the same form.\nBesides the replacement of p by x, the interpretation of the parameter\n\u03b1 changes, but this is irrelevant for the present analysis. Thus, the\nresults given in the present paper can be used, after some changes in\nnotation, also for the study of Bose-Einstein correlations in ordinary\nspace.\n4\n\n\f\u2022 Since the energy eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator are equidistant,\nthe corresponding Boltzmann factors form a geometrical progression.\nThus, formula (9) as well as the corresponding formula in the coordinate\nrepresentation, can be used to calculate the canonical density matrix\nfor the harmonic oscillator. According to Landau and Lifszyc [16],\nthis calculation for the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the\ncoordinate representation has been first performed by F. Bloch in year\n1932.\nThe author thanks Andrzej Bialas for collaboration and stimulating discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.Baym, Acta Phys. Pol. B29 (1998) 1839.\n[2] U.A. Wiedemann and U.
