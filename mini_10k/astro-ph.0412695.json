The rapid and seemingly random fluctuations in X-ray luminosity of\nSeyfert galaxies provided early support for the standard model in which Seyferts\nare powered by a supermassive black hole fed from an accretion disc. However, since\nEXOSAT there has been little opportunity to advance our understanding of the\nmost rapid X-ray variability. Observations with XMM-Newton have changed this.\nWe discuss some recent results obtained from XMM-Newton observations of\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. Particular attention will be given to the remarkable similarity\nfound between the timing properties of Seyferts and black hole X-ray binaries,\nincluding the power spectrum and the cross spectrum (time delays and coherence),\nand their implications for the physical processes at work in Seyferts.\n\n1. In the beginning...\nX-ray variability appears to be ubiquitous in Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN). The rapid and seemingly random fluctuations in the X-ray\nluminosity of Seyfert galaxies provided early support for the standard\nblack hole/accretion disc model (Rees, 1984) by implying compact\nemission regions and high luminosity densities (Barr & Mushotzky,\n1986).\n\n2. The EXOSAT era\nEXOSAT (1983\u20131986) was the first mission to provide long (\u223c 3 day),\nuninterrupted X-ray observations of Seyfert galaxies. From these observations the X-ray power spectra (see van der Klis, 1989) of Seyfert\ngalaxies were measured for the first time (Lawrence et al., 1987; Green\net al., 1993; Lawrence & Papadakis, 1993). The EXOSAT observations\nshowed that the power spectra of Seyferts above \u223c 10\u22125 Hz could be\napproximated by a power-law: P(f ) \u221d f \u2212\u03b1 where P(f ) is the power at\nfrequency f and \u03b1 is the power spectrum slope. The measured slopes\nfrom the EXOSAT observations were typically \u03b1 \u2248 1.5.

XMM-Newton light curve of Mrk 766 binned to 100 second resolution.\n\nlower frequencies, are called \"red noise\" (see Press, 1978). It was noted\nearly on (Lawrence et al., 1987) that this red noise variability of Seyferts\nis similar to that observed in Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs;\nBelloni & Hasinger, 1990; Nowak et al., 1999; Mc Clintock & Remillard,\n2004), perhaps suggesting that the same physical processes operate in\n5\nthese sources that differ in black hole mass by factors of >\n\u223c 10 .\n\n3. Low frequency power spectra from RXTE\nThe steep slopes found in the EXOSAT power spectra required there to\nbe a flattening at even lower frequencies (so that the integrated power\nremains finite). In recent years long RXTE monitoring observations\nhave detected these breaks (e.g. Uttley et al., 2002; Markowitz et al.,\n2003; see also the article by Ian Mc Hardy in these proceedings). Below\nthe break the slope is typically \u03b1lo \u2248 1 and at frequencies above the\nbreak the slope is \u03b1hi \u2248 2. (The EXOSAT power spectra spanned\nintermediate frequencies and often measured an intermediate slope\nover the break.) The breaks represent \"characteristic timescales\" in\nthe aperiodic variability of Seyferts and, significantly, appear to scale\nlinearly with the mass of the central black hole: fbreak \u221d 1/MBH .\n\n4. XMM-Newton results: high frequency power spectra\nUntil the launch of XMM-Newton (Jansen et al., 2001) high frequency\ntiming studies of Seyferts were not able to substantially improve on\nthe EXOSAT results. XMM-Newton's success is due to a combination\nof high throughput, broad energy bandpass and long (\u223c 2 day) orbit.\nFigure 1 shows an example of a broad-band (0.2 \u2212 10 keV) light curve\nfrom a single orbit observation.\n\nvaughan_edited.tex; 29/09/2018; 13:02; p.2\n\n\fRapid variability of Seyfert 1s\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. XMM-Newton power spectra of three Seyfert 1 galaxies. Shown are the\nbinned data (histograms) unfolded using the best-fitting broken power law continuum model (solid line). Note that the ordinate is in f \u00d7 P (f ) units (a slope\nof \u03b1 = 1 would appear flat). Note that the figure shows unfolded data, meaning\nthe data/model residuals multiplied by the best-fitting model. This is necessarily a\nmodel-dependent procedure and is not advisable if sharp features are present in the\nspectrum. However, for these rather broad, smooth spectra unfolding does provide\na clear, if slightly crude, impression of the shape of the underlying spectrum free\nfrom sampling effects.\n\nSeveral Seyfert 1 galaxies have been studied with long XMM-Newton\nobservations and yielded interesting power spectra. These include: NGC\n4051 (Mc Hardy et al., 2004), Mrk 766 (Vaughan & Fabian, 2003),\nMCG\u22126-30-15 (Vaughan et al., 2003), NGC 4395 (Vaughan et al., 2004)\n(and also Ark 564; Vignali et al., 2004). Figure 2 shows the power spectra for three of these. The XMM-Newton results clearly reveal similar\nhigh frequency breaks in the power spectra (also measured by RXTE in\nsome cases) but clearly show a substantial object-to-object differences\nin the normalisation of the power spectrum (which describes the overall\nvariability amplitude).\nThese XMM-Newton observations have also demonstrated the energy dependence of the power spectrum. Above the break frequency the\nslope \u03b1hi tends to be steeper at lower energies. This is clearly observed\nin MCG\u22126-30-15 (Vaughan et al., 2003) and NGC 4051 (Mc Hardy et\nal., 2004) but is not constrained by the other observations. This energy\ndependence was also measured in NGC 7469 using an intensive RXTE\nmonitoring campaign (Nandra & Papadakis, 2001).\n\nvaughan_edited.tex; 29/09/2018; 13:02; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nVaughan, Fabian & Iwasawa\n\n5. XMM-Newton results: high frequency cross spectrum\nIn addition to the energy dependence of the power spectrum, the excellent quality XMM-Newton light curves have allowed the cross spectrum\nto be investigated in several Seyfert 1s for the first time. Prior to XMMNewton only Papadakis et al. (2001) had measured the cross spectrum\nfor a Seyfert (NGC 7469 using RXTE).\nThe cross spectrum compares the variations in one band with those\nin another as a function of frequency. The amplitude of the cross\nspectrum gives the coherence (Vaughan & Nowak, 1997) while the\nargument gives the phase lag (time delay; Nowak et al., 1999). The\ncoherence quantifies any (linear) correlation between the variations\nin the two bands, irrespective of any time delays. The observations\ntypically show high coherence at the lowest frequencies (i.e. strong\ncorrelation) with a decrease at higher frequencies which implies there\nare independent variations between the two bands occurring on short\ntimescales (Vaughan et al., 2003; Mc Hardy et al., 2004; Vaughan et\nal., 2004). At low frequencies, where the coherence is high, the data\nalso exhibit small time delays, with the soft leading the hard variations\n(Vaughan et al., 2003; Mc Hardy et al., 2004). The magnitude of the\ntime delay decreases with increasing frequency (although the functional\nform of the relation is poorly constrained).\n6. Summary of results\nXMM-Newton has already made significant progress towards improving\nour understanding of the high frequency variability of Seyfert galaxies.\nThe timing studies have revealed:\n\u2212 Similar broken power spectra in Seyferts but object-to-object differences in normalisation (variability amplitude) and high frequency\nslope.\n\u2212 Energy-dependent high frequency power spectrum slope (steeper\nat lower energies).\n\u2212 High coherence at low frequencies, falling off at high frequencies.\n\u2212 Small (\u2206T \u223c 0.01/f ) soft-to-hard time delays\n\nvaughan_edited.tex; 29/09/2018; 13:02; p.4\n\n\fRapid variability of Seyfert 1s\n\n5\n\nFigure 3. The MBH \u2212 fbr relation for 11 Seyfert galaxies. The masses are from\nreverberation mapping experiments except for the four objects marked using dotted\nerror bars. Also shown are typical break frequencies for Cyg X-1 in both its low/hard\n(H) and high/soft (S) states. The dotted lines show example MBH \u221d 1/fbr relations\nconsistent with the Cyg X-1 points.\n\n7. Comparison with GBHCs\nThe frequencies of the breaks in the power spectra are broadly consistent with the long-held notion that the characteristic frequencies should\nscale as \u221d 1/MBH right down to stellar mass black holes. Figure 3\nshows the available data for 11 Seyferts. Although the uncertainties\nare rather large, the data seem consistent with an extrapolation of\nthe fbr \u221d 1/MBH relation from the well-studied GBHC Cygnus X1 (Belloni & Hasinger, 1990; Cui et al., 1996; Nowak et al., 1999;\nMc Clintock & Remillard, 2004). Note that the break frequency measurements come from a combination of XMM-Newton and RXTE observations. Long XMM-Newton observations are sensitive to breaks in\nthe range \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22122 Hz while the RXTE monitoring campaigns\nare sensitive to breaks at lower frequencies.\nThe connection between Seyferts and GBHCs is reinforced by the\nsimilarity between their cross spectra. It is well known that GBHCs\nshow highly coherent variations at low frequencies with the coherence fading away at the highest frequencies plus frequency dependent\ntime lags similar to those measured in Seyferts (Nowak et al., 1999;\n\nvaughan_edited.tex; 29/09/2018; 13:02; p.5\n\n\f6\n\nVaughan, Fabian & Iwasawa\n\nMc Clintock & Remillard, 2004). These all argue for a common mechanism responsible for producing the X-ray variability in Seyferts and\nGBHCs.\nOne may ask what advantage is gained by studying Seyferts in Xrays if GBHCs operate with the same physics but provide much higher\nquality data? One answer is that Seyferts can in fact provide data\nthat are in some senses better than that from GBHCs for studying\nthe highest frequencies. For example, comparing MCG\u22126-30-15 and\nCygnus X-1 we see the timescales are longer by \u223c 105 in the Seyfert, but\nthe X-ray flux is smaller by \u223c 103 . This means that per characteristic\ntimescale the Seyfert provides \u223c 102 more photons! Of course, GBHC\nenthusiasts can argue that GBHCs reclaim much of their advantage\neven here because one can always observe many (\u223c 105 ) more samples\nof a given timescale in a fixed amount of observing time, even if many\nless photons are recorded per timescale. Even so the power spectrum\nof MCG\u22126-30-15 could be measured up to \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz using the\nXMM-Newton data. This is equivalent to probing \u223c 500 Hz in Cygnus\nX-1, a challenge for even the best RXTE observations (Revnivtsev et\nal., 2000).\n\n8. Implications for the emission processes\nThe X-ray emission mechanism operating in Seyfert galaxies (and GBHCs) is usually thought to be inverse-Compton scattering. In the simplest models harder photons are expected to lag behind the softer\nphotons due to the larger number of scatterings required to produce\nharder photons; the delay should be of order the light-crossing time\nof the corona. The direction and magnitude of the observed time lags\nin Seyfert 1s are consistent with an origin in a Comptonising corona.\nHowever, if the lags are frequency dependent (as expected by analogy\nwith Cygnus X-1) the lags at lower temporal frequencies would become\nmuch longer than expected for a compact corona (see discussion in\nNowak et al., 1999). In addition, some models of Compton scattering\ncoronae predict the high frequency PSD should be steeper for higher\nenergy photons, due to the high-frequency fluctuations being washed\nout by multiple scatterings (Nowak & Vaughan, 1996), contrary to\nthe observations. Alternatively, the time delay between soft and hard\nbands could be due to the spectral evolution of individual X-ray events\n(Poutanen & Fabian, 1999) or propagation of accretion rate variations\nthrough a extended emission region (Kotov et al., 2001).\n\nvaughan_edited.tex; 29/09/2018; 13:02; p.6\n\n\fRapid variability of Seyfert 1s\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\nBased on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science\nmission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA\nMember States and the USA (NASA).
