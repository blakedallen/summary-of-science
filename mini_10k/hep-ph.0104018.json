First, we analyze these decay channels within factorization,\nshowing that, irrespectively of the value of \u03b3, it is not possible to reproduce the experimental data. Then, we discuss \u039bQCD /mB\ncorrections to these processes, and argue that there is a class of doubly Cabibbo enhanced non-factorizable contributions, usually\ncalled charming penguins, that cannot be neglected. Including these corrections, we obtain an excellent agreement with experimental\ndata. Furthermore, contrary to what is obtained with factorization, we predict sizable rate asymmetries in B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 0 and\nB \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0\u2213 .\n\n1\n\nof the operators Qc1 and Qc2 , usually referred to as charming penguins. Since the original publications, about three\nyears ago, several other decay channels have been measured 14,15,16 and the precision of the measurements is\nconstantly improving in time. With respect to the previous analyses, it is now possible to attempt a more quantitative study of charming penguin effects and of the corrections expected to the factorized predictions.\nIn this talka , we will focus on B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays, where\nthe effect of O(\u039bQCD /mQ ) corrections to factorization\nis most striking. The interested reader can find a more\ngeneral analysis, including also B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays, in ref. 17 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe theoretical understanding of non-leptonic two body\nB decays is a fundamental step for testing flavour physics\nand CP violation in the Standard Model and for detecting signals of new physics. 1,2,3 The increasing accuracy\nof the experimental measurements at the B factories 4,5\ncalls for a significant improvement of the theoretical predictions. In this respect, important progress has been\nrecently achieved by systematic studies of factorization\nmade by two independent groups. 6,7 These studies, while\nconfirming the physical idea 8 that factorization holds for\nhadrons containing heavy quarks, mQ \u226b \u039bQCD , give the\nexplicit formulae necessary to compute quantitatively the\nrelevant amplitudes at the leading order in \u039bQCD /mQ .\nAt this Workshop, many talks and posters 9 have discussed in detail the predictions for various nonleptonic\nB decay channels using the formalism of refs 6,7 . However, only perturbative corrections to factorization can\nbe computed using these two approaches. The question which naturally arises is whether in practice the\npower-suppressed corrections, for which quantitative estimates are missing to date, may be phenomenologically\nimportant for B decays. This problem was previously addressed in refs. 10,11,12 . In particular, the main conclusion\nof refs. 10 was that penguin contractions of the leading\noperators of the effective weak Hamiltonian, Q1 and Q2 ,\nalthough formally of O(\u039bQCD /mQ ), may be important in\ncases where the factorized amplitudes are either colour or\nCabibbo suppressed. The most dramatic effect of these\nnon-factorizable penguin contractions manifested itself in\nthe very large enhancement of the B \u2192 K\u03c0 branching\nratios, as was also emerging from the first measurements\nby the CLEO Collaboration 13 . In this case, the effect\nwas caused by Cabibbo-enhanced penguin contractions\n\n2\n\nFormalism\n\nThe physical amplitudes for B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays are more\nconveniently written in terms of RG invariant parameters built using the Wick contractions of the effective\nHamiltonian 18 . In the heavy quark limit, following the\napproach of ref. 7 , it is possible to compute these RG\ninvariant parameters using factorization. The formalism\nhas been developed so that it is possible to include also\nthe perturbative corrections to order \u03b1s . An alternative\napproach is provided by the formalism of ref. 6 . The two\nmethods differ in the treatment of the O(\u03b1s ) terms. We\npresent results obtained with the formalism of ref. 7 only,\nwith the addition of the non-perturbative \u039bQCD /mb corrections to factorization. A comparison with the formalism of ref. 6 will be presented elsewhere.\nIn the leading amplitudes, we have taken into account the SU(3) breaking terms by using the appropriate\ndecay constants, fK and f\u03c0 and form factors, fK (0) and\nf\u03c0 (0).

Alternatively we may take only |Vub | from the experiments\nand fit the value of \u03b3. In the first case, the results are\ngiven in table 2 labelled as \"\u03b3 UTA\" and show a generalized disagreement between predictions and experimental data. In the second case, the value of \u03b3 is fitted and the results are labelled as \"\u03b3 free\". In this\ncase the disagreement is reduced for BR(B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + )\nand BR(Bd \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ), but it remains important for\nBR(Bd \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 ) and BR(B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 ). The pattern BR(B + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + ):BR(Bd \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ):BR(Bd \u2192\nK 0 \u03c0 0 ):BR(B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 )=2:2:1:1, which is suggested by\nthe data, and is well reproduced when the contribution\nof the charming penguins is large, as discussed in the\nfollowing, is lost in this case. Moreover the fitted value\nof \u03b3 = (162 \u00b1 13)0 is in striking disagreement with the\nresults of the UTA. Although one may question on the\nquoted uncertainty of the UTA result, it is clearly impossible to reconcile the two numbers. Thus either there is\nnew physics or \u039bQCD /mb corrections are important. We\nnow consider the latter possibility.\n\nstead SU (3) symmetry and neglected Zweig-suppressed\ncontributions. In this approximation, all the Cabibboenhanced \u039bQCD /mb corrections to B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays can\nbe reabsorbed in a single parameter P\u03031 . This parameter includes not only the charming penguin contribution,\nbut also annihilation and penguin contractions of penguin operators. It does not include leading emission amplitudes of penguin operators (Q3 \u2013Q6 ) which have been\nexplicitly evaluated using factorization. Had we included\nthese terms, this contribution would correspond to the\nparameter P1 of ref. 18 . For simplicity, in the following\nwe will continue to refer to P\u03031 as the charming penguin\ncontribution.\nWe proceed with the usual likelihood method, by\nextracting the input quantities weighted by their distribution, which is assumed to be flat for theoretical errors and Gaussian for experimental ones.

Here and in\nall the other cases where |Vub | and \u03b3 are taken from the\nstandard Unitarity Triangle Analysis (UTA), we use as\nequivalent input parameters the values of \u03c1\u0304 and \u03b7\u0304 given\nin table 1 from the analysis of ref. 1 .

We will return on this point in the following. In table 3 we give the corresponding predicted\nvalues and uncertainties for the relevant branching ratios. We observe a remarkable improvement in the fit.\nOnce charming penguins are included, very little sensitivity to \u03b3 is left and therefore no information on \u03b3 can\nbe extracted from the study of B \u2192 K\u03c0 BRs. However,\nthe presence of a large phase in the charming penguin\ncontribution opens up the possibility of observing a large\nrate CP asymmetry,\nA=\n\n-0.4\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have studied B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays, taking as a starting\npoint the factorized amplitude as obtained in the approach of ref. 7 , and adding Cabibbo-enhanced nonperturbative \u039bQCD /mB corrections (charming penguins),\nwhich turn out to be dominant in these channels. We\nhave shown that\n\u2022 using factorization and the information on \u03b3 from\nthe UTA, all B \u2192 K\u03c0 BRs come out to be much\nsmaller than the experimental value;\n\n(5)\n\n\u2022 even treating \u03b3 as a free parameter, a sizable discrepancy between factorized predictions and experimental data remains present;\n\nin B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays. Indeed, while these asymmetries\ncome out to be always negligible if one uses the approach of ref. 7 , when charming penguins are included\nwe predict visible asymmetries in two B \u2192 K\u03c0 channels, as reported in table 3 and in figs. 2 and 3. Once\nthe sign of the asymmetry is determined experimentally,\nthe sign ambiguity in the charming penguin phase can\nbe resolved. With improved experimental data, in the\nfuture one might think of extracting informations on \u03b3\nfrom these asymmetries, exploiting the fact that they are\nproportional to sin \u03b3 sin \u03c6 (neglecting the very small perturbative strong phases).\n\n\u2022 the inclusion of charming penguins, which is\nmandatory in these channels where they are doubly\nCabibbo-enhanced, gives a perfect agreement with\ndata irrespectively of the value of \u03b3;\n\u2022 once charming penguins are included, no information on \u03b3 can be extracted from CP-averaged\nB \u2192 K\u03c0 BRs;\n\u2022 sizable rate asymmetries are predicted for Bd \u2192\nK + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 , and an experimental determination of the sign of the asymmetry can re3\n\n\fsolve the sign ambiguity on the charming penguin\nstrong phase;\n\u2022 in the future, with more precise measurements, one\nmight think of extracting informations on \u03b3 combining experimental values of CP-averaged BRs\nand rate asymmetries.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these issues, together\nwith a careful analysis of B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays, we refer the\nreader to ref. 17 .\n10.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank G.
