E-mail: sbandy@vcu.edu\n\n1\n\n\fIn 1990, Datta and Das proposed a spintronic analog of the electro-optic modulator [1].\nIt consists of a quasi one-dimensional semiconductor channel with ferromagnetic source and\ndrain contacts (Fig. 1(a)). Electrons are injected with a definite spin orientation from the\nsource, which is then controllably precessed in the channel with a gate-controlled Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction [2], and finally sensed at the drain. At the drain end, the electron's\ntransmission probability depends on the relative alignment of its spin with the drain's (fixed)\nmagnetization. By controlling the angle of spin precession in the channel with a gate voltage,\none can control the relative spin alignment at the drain end, and hence control the sourceto-drain current. This realizes the basic \"transistor\" action. Because of this attribute, the\nDatta-Das device came to be known as the ballistic Spin Field Effect Transistor (SPINFET).\nDespite the fact that the SPINFET was proposed more than a decade ago, it has never\nbeen experimentally realized. Recently, we found that one of the serious impediments to\nits realization is the presence of a magnetic field in its channel caused by the ferromagnetic\nsource and drain contacts. This field has been ignored in practically all past work, but has\ncrucial consequences. Based on available data for device configurations that are similar to\nthe SPINFET [3], we estimate that in a 0.2 \u03bcm long channel, the average magnetic field\nmay approach 1 Tesla. This field has many deleterious effects [4, 5]. First, it results in a\nZeeman spin splitting that affects the dispersion relations of the Rashba spin split subbands\nin the channel. Consequently, there is \"spin mixing\" in each subband, so that no subband\nhas a definite spin quantization axis [4]. As a result, non-magnetic scatterers can flip spin [5]\nthereby making spin transport non-ballistic in the presence of normal impurities, surface\nroughness, etc., which otherwise would not have affected spin transport. Second, the \"phase\nshift\" of the spintronic modulator will be no longer independent of energy [4, 5] (in ref. 1, it\nwas claimed to be independent of energy because the channel magnetic field was ignored).\nTherefore, ensemble averaging over electron energy will dilute the modulation effect. Suffice\nit to say then that it is important to eliminate the magnetic field in the channel.\nAlthough it is possible to engineer the Datta-Das device to reduce the channel field, it\n\n2\n\n\fcan never be completely eliminated (unless complicated spin filter devices [6] are employed)\nsince the magnetization in the source and drain contacts have to be always along the channel.\nThe only other solution is to find an alternate analogous device where the magnetic fields\ndue to the source and drain contacts are transverse to the channel. Here, we do precisely\nthat and propose an alternate device, based on the Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction [7]\nrather than the Rashba interaction. In this device, the source/drain magnetization will be\ntransverse to the channel, which vastly reduces the channel magnetic field. The only channel\nfield that could be present is the fringing field at the edges adjoining the source and drain\ncontacts. This is negligible.\nOur device is schematically shown in Fig 1(b) and 1(c). Since it has no structural inversion asymmetry, we can ignore the Rashba interaction. However, there is a bulk inversion\nasymmetry in the channel material that ensures the presence of a Dresselhaus interaction.\nWe will also assume a strictly one-dimensional (1-d) channel (only the lowest subband is\noccupied by carriers) in order to extract the best device performance. The need for one\ndimensionality was already elucidated in ref. 1. Furthermore, since there is no DyakonovPerel' spin relaxation in a strictly 1-d channel in the absence of a channel magnetic field [8],\nwe can expect nearly ballistic spin transport. Following usual procedure, the 1-d channel\nwill be defined by split gates [9] on the surface of a quantum well heterostructure.\nThe single-particle Hamiltonian describing an electron in the 1-d channel of this device\nis\n\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n\u03c0\nm\u2217 \u03c9\n~2 kx2\n+ 2a42 \u03c3x kx\n\u2212\nH =\u01eb+\n2m\u2217\n2~\nWy\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the lowest subband energy, a42 is the material constant associated with the strength\nof the Dresselhaus interaction [10], \u03c3 is the Pauli spin matrix, and Wy is the channel dimension in the y-direction. We assume the potential profile in the y-direction to be a square\nwell with hardwall boundaries and the potential profile in the z-direction is parabolic since\nconfinement in this direction is enforced by split gates. The curvature of the parabolic potential is \u03c9 which can be tuned by varying the applied voltage on the Schottky split gates.\n3\n\n\fHere, we have assumed a direct gap semiconductor. The Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction\nterm has a subtle dependence on the crystallographic orientation of the channel [11], but it\nis not qualitatively important in the present context. It may however assume importance in\ndevice optimization.\nThe rest of the analysis is fashioned after ref. 1. Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in\nEquation (1), we find that the eigenspinors in the channel are [1 1]\u2020 and [1 -1]\u2020 which are\n+x-polarized and -x-polarized states. They have eigenenergies that differ by 2\u03b2kx where \u03b2\n= 2 a42 [m\u2217 \u03c9/(2~) \u2212 (\u03c0/Wy )2 ]. Accordingly,\n2\nE(+x pol.) = \u01eb + ~2 kx+\n/2m\u2217 + \u03b2kx+\n2\nE(\u2212x pol.) = \u01eb + ~2 kx\u2212\n/2m\u2217 \u2212 \u03b2kx\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nAn electron incident on the channel with energy E will have two different wavevectors\nkx+ or kx\u2212 depending on whether its spin is +x or -x-polarized. Now, if we inject a +zpolarized electron into the channel from the source contact, it will couple equally to the +x\nand -x-polarized subbands since\n\u0014\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0015\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n1\n\n\u0015\n\n+\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u22121\n\n\u0015\n\n(3)\n\nAt the drain end, the eigenspinor will be [eikx+ L + eikx\u2212 L eikx+ L \u2212 eikx\u2212 L ]\u2020 , where L is\nthe channel length. If the drain is magnetized in the +z direction, then the transmission\nprobability (and therefore the source to drain current) will be proportional to |[1 0][eikx+ L +\neikx\u2212 L eikx+ L \u2212 eikx\u2212 L ]\u2020 |2 = 4 cos2 [(kx\u2212 \u2212 kx+ )L/2] = 4 cos2 [m \u2217 \u03b2L/~2 ], where we have used\nEquation (2) to arrive at the last equality.\nIt is obvious now that this device is an exact analog of the device in ref. 1. As in ref. 1, we\npoint out that the phase shift between the two orthogonal spin states (+x and -x polarized)\nis \u2206\u03c6 (= 2m\u2217\u03b2L/~2 ) which is independent of the electron wavevector (or energy). Therefore\nthe interference between the two spin states causing the conductance modulation survives\nensemble averaging over the electron energy at elevated temperatures. Actually, this is only\n4\n\n\fstrictly true if there is no channel magnetic field [4, 5]. In the Datta-Das device, this would\nnot have been strictly true because of the channel magnetic field, but in our case, it is.\nThe crucial difference between this device and that in ref. 1 is that here the contacts\nhave to be magnetized in the z-direction so that the magnetic field caused by the contacts\nis perpendicular to the channel which is in the x-direction. That is why, we can neglect\nany Zeeman spin splitting in the channel which we could not do for the device in ref. 1.\nAs mentioned before, this Zeeman spin splitting (or the channel magnetic field) would have\nbeen harmful to the device in many ways.\nBefore concluding, we can compare the minimum channel lengths Lmin required to cause\na phase shift of \u03c0 radians between the two spin states. The channel must be at least this\nlong in order to observe one complete cycle of switching from the maximum to the minimum\nconductance state. Comparing the two devices:\n\u03b2\na42 m\u2217 \u03c9/(2~)\nLmin |ref. 1\n= \u2248\nLmin |this device\n\u03b7\na46 E\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the strength of Rashba coupling as defined in ref. 1, a46 is a material parameter\nindicative of the degree of Rashba coupling and E is the interface electric field causing the\nRashba coupling. In GaAs, a42 is calculated to be 2.9\u00d710\u221229 eV-m3 [10], a46 is calculated\nas 9\u00d710\u221239 C-m2 [12], and E can be as high as 300 kV/cm. We will assume that ~\u03c9 = 25\nmeV (~\u03c9 \u2248 25 meV was achieved in ref. [9]). Based on these figures, Lmin |this device =\n0.36Lmin |ref. 1, so that the two lengths are comparable (of the same order).\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a device which is analogous to the spintronic modulator\nproposed in ref. 1, but has the additional advantage of being immune to spin mixing effects in\nthe channel, spin flip by non-magnetic scatterers, and dilution of the modulation by ensemble\naveraging over the electron energy. All this has been achieved by eliminating the channel\nmagnetic field. The fabrication of this device is no more difficult than fabricating the 1-d\nSPINFET of ref. 1; in fact, it may be somewhat simpler since we do not need a top gate\n(or back gate) to induce the Rashba effect. It is possible that this device may be easier to\nimplement, and may be somewhat more robust than the device of ref. 1.\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S. Datta and B. Das, Appl. Phys.
