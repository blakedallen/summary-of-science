Using this approach we provide a general\nframework for studying corrections to the entropy of black holes beyond semiclassical approximations. Applying the properties of exact differentials for three variables\nto the first law thermodynamics, we study charged rotating black holes and explicitly work out the corrections to entropy and horizon area for the Kerr-Newman and\ncharged rotating BTZ black holes. It is shown that the results for other geometries\nlike the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m and anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild spacetimes follow easily.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f1. Introduction\nHawking's ground-breaking work [1] on black hole evaporation and information loss\nis based on the idea that a pair of particles is created just inside the event horizon\nand from this pair the positive energy particle tunnels out of the hole and appears\nas Hawking radiation. The negative energy particle tunnels inwards and results in\ndecrease of the mass of the black hole. The energy of the particle changes sign\nas it crosses the horizon. These particles follow trajectories which cannot be explained classically. This process of particle evaporation from black holes is thus a\nphenomenon of quantum tunneling of particles through the event horizon [2]. This\ncontributes to the change in mass, angular momentum and charge of the black hole,\nwhich change its thermodynamics as well. The particle travels in time so that the\naction becomes complex and the dynamics of the outgoing particle is governed by the\nimaginary part of this action. This action has been calculated using the radial null\ngeodesics [2] or the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi method [3] for various spacetimes. Using the method of the radial null geodesics Hawking radiation as a tunneling process\nhas been analyzed for the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes [4]. They have done\nthe analysis using transformed forms of these metrics and they do not consider the\nquestion of quantum corrections at all. The Hamilton-Jacobi method has been used\nto calculate quantum corrections to the Hawking temperature and the BekensteinHawking area law for the Schwarzschild, anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild and Kerr black\nholes [3]. These corrections have been worked out for the uncharged BTZ black hole\nas well [5].\nIn this paper we extend this analysis to black holes that are not spherically\nsymmetric and are charged and rotating. For this purpose we set up a criterion for\nexactness of differential of black hole entropy, from the first law of thermodynamics\nfor three parameters (mass, angular momentum and charge), so that entropy can be\nwritten in a convenient form. Using this we provide a sufficiently general framework\nfor calculating quantum corrections beyond the semiclassical limit of entropy. As a\nresult of quantum effects the famous Bekenstein-Hawking area law is also modified.\nWe apply this to the Kerr-Newman and the charged rotating BTZ black holes, in\nparticular. We find that the leading correction term is logarithmic, which is consistent with the results found using quantum geometry techniques and field theoretic\nmethods. The other terms involve ascending powers of inverse of the area. Further, we show that the earlier investigations for finding (quantum) corrections are\nrecovered as special cases of the present study.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section we briefly provide motiva-\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\ftion for studying quantum corrections of black hole entropy. In Section 3 we set up\na criterion for exactness of differentials in three variables and apply this to the first\nlaw of thermodynamics. In Sections 4 and 5 we apply the above theory to the cases\nof the Kerr-Newman and charged rotating BTZ black holes, respectively. At the end\nwe give conclusions.\n\n2. Quantum corrections for entropy of black holes\nIn semiclassical treatment the radial trajectories of a massless particle in a spacetime\ndescribed by the metric, g\u03bc\u03bd , have the wave function\ni\n\n\u03c6(r, t) = e\u2212 ~ S(r,t) ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhich satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation\n\u0002 \u221a\n\u0003\n~2\n\u2212 \u221a \u2202\u03bc g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212g\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 = 0.\n\u2212g\n\n(2.2)\n\nWhen a particle with positive energy crosses the horizon and tunnels out, it\nescapes to infinity and appear as Hawking radiation. However, when a particle with\nnegative energy tunnels inwards it is absorbed by the black hole and as a result the\nmass of the black hole decreases. The essence of the quantum tunneling argument\nfor Hawking radiation is the calculation of the imaginary part of the action, which\nfor a black hole of radius r and momentum pr is defined by [2]\nrout\n\nZ\n\nImS = Im\n\nZrinrout\n\n= Im\n\nrin\n\npr dr\nZ pr\n\ndp\u2032r dr.\n\n(2.3)\n\n0\n\nIf we use Hamilton's equation\n\u1e59 =\n\ndH\ndpr\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\nr\n\nin the above action, we get\n\nImS = Im\n\nZ\n\nrout\n\nrin\n\nZ\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\nH\n0\n\ndH \u2032\ndr.\n\u1e59\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fFor the Schwarzschild spacetime, for example, rin = 2M and rout = 2(M \u2212 \u03c9), where\n\u03c9 denotes the energy. We expand the action S(r, t) in powers of ~\nS(r, t) = S0 (r, t) + ~S1 (r, t) + ~2 S2 (r, t) + . . . ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nsuch that S0 gives the semiclassical value and higher order terms correspond to\nquantum corrections. An analysis similar to the one done earlier [3] shows that the\ncorrection terms Si are of the order of ~i and are proportional to the semiclassical\ncontribution S0 . The Klein-Gordon equation and the dimensional analysis suggest\nthat the constants of proportionality for charged rotating black holes have the di2\nmensions of (r+\n+ a2 )\u2212i , where r+ represents the horizon. In order to make the\ncorrections dimensionless, we write the series expansion as\n\"\n#\nX\n\u03b1i ~ i\nS = S0 1 +\n.\n(2.7)\n2\n2 )i\n(r\n+\na\n+\ni\nThis expansion will be used later to work out quantum corrections in entropy and\nhorizon area in different geometries.\n\n3. Exact differentials in three variables and the first law of\nthermodynamics\nWe will be using the first law of thermodynamics in three parameters, for which we\nneed the analysis of differentials in three variables.

Or, we can rewrite as\ndS(M, J, Q) =\n\n1\n\u03a9\n\u03a6\ndM \u2212 dJ \u2212 dQ.\nT\nT\nT\n\n(3.6)\n\nWritten in this way the A, B, C of conditions (3.2) will be replaced by 1/T , \u2212\u03a9/T ,\n\u2212\u03a6/T , in which case M, J, Q will play the role of x, y, z, respectively. In other words,\nwe note that in order for dS to be an exact differential (3.6) the following conditions\nmust be satisfied\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u03a9\n1\n\u2202\n=\n\u2212\n,\n\u2202J T\n\u2202M\nT\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n1\n\u2202\n\u03a6\n=\n\u2212\n,\n\u2202Q T\n\u2202M\nT\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9\n\u2202\n\u03a6\n\u2202\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n.\n\u2202Q\nT\n\u2202J\nT\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\nNow we can use (3.4) to write entropy for the black hole in integral form as\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u03a9\n\u03a6\nS(M, J, Q) =\ndM \u2212\ndJ \u2212\ndQ\nT\nT\nT\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n\u2202\ndM\ndJ\n\u2212\n\u2202J\nT\nZ\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f\u0012Z\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0013\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1\n\u03a9\n\u2202\n\u2202\ndM\ndQ +\ndJ\ndQ\n\u2212\n\u2202Q\nT\n\u2202Q\nT\n\u0012Z \u0012\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\u0013 \u0013\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n+\ndM\ndJ dQ.\n\u2202Q\n\u2202J\nT\nZ \u0012\n\n(3.10)\n\nWe will see in the next sections that this provides a convenient way to calculate\nquantum corrections for entropy of charged rotating black holes.\n\n4. Entropy corrections for the Kerr-Newman black hole\nWe want to calculate quantum corrections to entropy beyond the semiclassical limit\nfor charged rotating black holes. The corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking area law\nwill also undergo corrections and will be modified. For this purpose, we will use the\ncriterion described above for exactness of differential of entropy.

It is\nnot difficult to verify these relations, for all orders, by using from (4.3)-(4.5). In\ngeneral, quantum corrections to the temperature are accompanied by corrections to\nthe angular velocity and the electrostatic potential, in which case they always make\ndS exact. It is interesting to note that in our case we do not require corrections for\n\u03a9 and \u03a6. This is due to the particular functional form of (4.11).

If we put\ncharge, Q = 0, we recover the corrections for the case of the Kerr black black hole\n[3]. Further, if the angular momentum is also put equal to zero we get results for the\nSchwarzschild black hole (a = Q = 0). In this case the proportionality constants in\nthe above series involve inverse powers of square of the mass, M. On the other hand\nif only the angular momentum vanishes (i.e. a = 0), we get corresponding corrections\nfor Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole, in which case the power series involve the charge\nQ also, in addition to M, which are the only two parameters for this object.\nIf we use the Bekenstein-Hawking area law relating entropy and horizon area, A,\nby\nS=\n\nA\n,\n4~\n\n(4.25)\n\nwhere, the area in our case is\n2\nA = 4\u03c0(r+\n+ a2 ),\n\nfrom (4.24) we obtain\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(4.26)\n\n\fS=\n\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b12 ~ 8\u03c0 3 \u03b13 ~2\nA\n+ \u03c0\u03b11 lnA \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 ***,\n4~\nA\nA2\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhich gives quantum corrections for the area law. Note that the first term is the usual\nsemiclassical area, the second term is the logarithmic correction found earlier [9] by\nfield theoretic arguments. The issue of the value of \u03b1i 's is highly disputatious. There\nare different interpretations found in the literature. The prefactor of the logarithmic\nterm, \u03b11 , for example, is given to be \u22123/2 in Ref. 10, and \u22121/2 in Ref. 11. Similarly,\nsome authors [12] take it to be a positive integer, while others find it even to be zero\n[13].\n\n5. Entropy corrections for the charged rotating BTZ black\nhole\nNext we consider the (1+2) Ba\u00f1ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole [14], when\nit is charged and rotating.

Here we will circumvent the difficulty of finding the roots\nby using the results obtained above on exactness of the entropy function for three\nparameters to work out the integrals involved in the corrections. Secondly, instead of\nsubstituting the value of r+ directly into different expressions we will be using chain\nrules of differentiation. Let us write\n\u2212M +\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fJ2\n\u03c0\nr2\n+\n\u2212 Q2 lnr.\n2\n2\nl\n4r\n2\nThe angular velocity of a rotating black hole is [16]\n\n(5.3)\n\nf (r) = \u2212M +\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03a9 = \uf8f0\u2212\n\ng\u03c6t\n\u2212\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n\ns\u0012\n\ng\u03c6t\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212\n\ng\u03c6t\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n\n=\nr=r+\n\ngtt \uf8fb\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(5.4)\n\nr=r+\n\nFor the BTZ black hole this becomes\n\u03a9=\u2212\n\n\uf8f9\n\nJ\n2r 2\n\n.\n\n(5.5)\n\nr=r+\n\nThe event horizon is related with temperature T by [6, 17]\n~f \u2032 (r)\nT =\n4\u03c0\n\n,\n\n(5.6)\n\nr=r+\n\nwhere f \u2032 (r) denotes the derivative of f with respect to r.

Therefore, the semiclassical entropy becomes\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n1\n8\u03c0l2\ndM =\nT\n~\n\nZ\n\n3\nr+\ndM\n.\n4\n2\n2\n2\n4r+ \u2212 J l \u2212 \u03c0Q2 l2 r+\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn order to evaluate this integral, we note that from (5.2) we can write\ndM =\n\n\u0012\n\n2r+\nJ2\n\u03c0Q2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n3\nl2\n2r+\n2r+\n\n\u0013\n\ndr+ .\n\n(5.9)\n\nUsing this in the integral in (5.8) we readily get\n4\u03c0r+\n,\n~\nwhich is the standard formula for entropy in this geometry.\nS=\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(5.10)\n\n\fNow we calculate quantum corrections to the entropy. We first note that for the\ncase of three dimensional BTZ black hole the correction terms are proportional to\n(r+ )\u2212i , so that the corrected action can be written as\n\u0014\nX \u03b1i ~ i \u0015\n.\nS = S0 1 +\n(r+ )i\n\n(5.11)\n\nWe use the differential of the entropy dS from (3.6) and using the exactness criteria\nobtain an integral expression of the form (4.16). This expression is simplified as\nbefore, so that we obtain the following form which includes quantum corrections to\nthe entropy as well.\n\u0012\nZ\nX \u03b1i ~ i \u0013\n1\nS(M, J, Q) =\n1+\ndM\nT\n(r+ )i\n= I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 + * * * ,\n(5.12)\nwhere the uncorrected semiclassical term I1 is given by (5.10). For the correction\nterms we proceed as follows. The integral I2 is given by\nZ\n1\nI 2 = \u03b11 ~\ndM.\n(5.13)\nr+ T\n\nUsing (5.6) and (5.9) this simplifies to\nZ\n1\nI2 = 4\u03c0\u03b11\ndr+ = 4\u03c0\u03b11 ln r+ .\nr+\n\nSimilarly,\n\nI 3 = \u03b12 ~\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\nr+\nT\n\ndM = \u2212\n\n4\u03b12 ~\u03c0\n,\nr+\n\n(5.14)\n\n(5.15)\n\nand so on.

Conclusion\nOne way to describe Hawking radiation is by the process of quantum tunneling\nthereby particles cross event horizons and traverse \"forbidden\" trajectories. The\npositive energy particles tunnel out of the event horizon, whereas, the negative energy particles tunnel in and result in black hole evaporation. Thus a system which\nis stable classically becomes unstable quantum mechanically, and this changes the\nthermodynamics of the system as well. We have used this analysis to study quantum\ncorrections in entropy for charged and rotating black holes. For this purpose we use\nthe criterion for exactness of differential of entropy. With the help of this procedure\nthe formidable integrals involving quantum corrections become manageable and we\nobtain power series for entropy and Bekenstein-Hawking horizon area of black holes\nfor a quite general framework. We first applied this to the Kerr-Newman black holes.\nThe first term obtained in the power series is the semiclassical value, while the leading correction term is logarithmic as has been found using other methods. The other\n2\n2 \u22121\nterms involve ascending powers of (r+\n+a2 )\u22121 . This reduces to (r+\n) for non-rotating\nobjects like Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black hole. If the charge and angular momentum\nboth become zero, we obtain results for the Schwarzschild black hole, in which case\nthe power series involve mass only as it is the only macroscopic parameter for this\nobject. This is true for the entropy corrections of the anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild\nspacetimes also. An important feature of our approach is that we have obtained the\ncorrections in entropy without requiring the corrections in the angular momentum\nand the electrostatic potential.\nAnother significant application of the procedure is for the three dimensional\nBTZ black hole, when it is charged and rotating. Here without having to find the\nhorizon we have been able to calculate quantum corrections beyond semiclassical\napproximation by using the exactness criterion for the entropy differential. In this\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fcase also the modified Bekenstein-Hawking area law has been derived. The leading\norder correction term is again found to be logarithmic in this case.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the organizers of the First NCP Scientific Spring, National Centre for Physics, Islamabad, April 6-9, 2009, where this work was presented.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.W.
