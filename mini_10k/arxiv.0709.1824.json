We include photons using both a fixed order\nand a resummation approach. In the latter, leading higher order corrections are automatically included. We present results for cross sections and event generation for both\nmethods [1].This is an updated version of the results presented in [2].\n\nPITHA 07/10, SFB/CPP-07-51\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn many GUT models, the masses of charginos tend to be near the lower edge of the superpartner spectrum, and they can be pair-produced at a first-phase ILC with c.m. energy of\n500 GeV. The precise measurement of their parameters (masses, mixings, and couplings)\nis a key for uncovering the fundamental properties of the MSSM [3]. Regarding the experimental precision at the ILC, off-shell kinematics for the signal process, the reducible and\nirreducible backgrounds [4], and NLO corrections need to be included. We here present the\ninclusion of NLO chargino production where corrections can be in the percent regime.\n\n2\n\nChargino production at LO and NLO\n\nThe total fixed-order NLO cross section is given by\n\u03c3tot (s, m2e ) = \u03c3Born (s) + \u03c3v+s (s, \u2206E\u03b3 , m2e ) + \u03c32\u21923 (s, \u2206E\u03b3 , m2e ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the cm energy, me the electron mass, and \u2206 E\u03b3 the soft photon energy cut\ndividing the photon phase space. The 'virtual' contribution \u03c3v is the interference of the\none-loop corrections [5] with the Born term. The collinear and infrared singularities are\nregulated by me and the photon mass \u03bb, respectively. The dependence on \u03bb is eliminated\nby adding the soft real photon contribution \u03c3s = fsoft \u03c3Born (s) with a universal soft factor\n\u2206E\nfsoft ( \u03bb \u03b3 ) [6]. We break the 'hard' contribution \u03c32\u21923 (s, \u2206E\u03b3 , m2e ), i.e., the real-radiation\n+\nprocess e\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\ni \u03c7\u0303j \u03b3, into a collinear and a non-collinear part, separated at a photon\nacollinearity angle \u2206\u03b8\u03b3 relative to the incoming electron or positron. The collinear part is\nm2\n\napproximated by convoluting the Born cross section with a structure function f (x; \u2206\u03b8\u03b3 , se )\n[7]. The non-collinear part is generated explicitely.\nThe total fixed order cross section is implemented in the multi-purpose event generator\nO'Mega/WHIZARD [8, 9] using a 'user-defined' structure function and an effective matrix\nelement |Meff |2 which contains the Born part, the soft-photon factor and the Born-1 loop\ninterference term. In the soft-photon region this approach runs into the problem of negative\n\u2217 Work supported by DFG SFB/TR9 \"Computational Particle Physics\" and German Helmholtz Association, Grant VH-NG-005.\n\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\f+\ne\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u03c7\u03031\n\nLO\n\n|Meff |2 (\u2212 + +\u2212)\n\u221a\n\nLO\n\n2\n|Mres\neff | (-++-)\n\n10\n0.5\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2206E = 10\n\ns = 1 TeV\n\n+\ne\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u03c7\u03031\n\ns = 1 TeV\n\n\u2206E = 0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\ncos \u03b8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\ncos \u03b8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n\nFigure 1: \u03b8 -dependence of effective squared matrix element ( s = 1 TeV).Left figure: fixed\norder effective matrix element; right figure: effective matrix element with the one-photon ISR part\nsubtracted.

To still obtain\nunweighted event samples, an ad-hoc approach is to simply drop events with negative events\nbefore proceeding further.\nNegative event weights can be avoided by resumming higher-order initial radiation using\nan exponentiated structure function fISR [11]. In order to avoid double-counting in the\ncombination of the ISR-resummed LO result with the additional NLO contributions [5],\nwe have subtract from the effective squared matrix element the soft and virtual photonic\n2\n2\ncontributions that have already been accounted for in \u03c3s+v . This defines |Mres\neff | = |Meff | \u2212\n2fsoft,ISR |MBorn |2 which is positive for even low \u2206E\u03b3 cuts for all values of \u03b8 (cf Fig. 1), such\nthat unweighting of generated events and realistic simulation at NLO are now possible in all\nregions of phase-space. Convoluting this with the resummed ISR structure function for each\nincoming beam, we obtain a modified 2 \u2192 2 part of the total cross section which also includes\nsoft and collinear photonic corrections to the Born/one-loop interference. This differs from\nthe standard treatment in the literature (cf eg. [5]) where higher order photon contributions\nare combined with the Born term only (\"Born+\").

LO:\nBorn cross section.\n\nresult is not exactly cutoff-independent, but exhibits a slight rise of the calculated cross\nsection with increasing cutoff (breakdown of the soft approximation). For \u2206E\u03b3 = 1 GeV\n(10 GeV) the shift is about 2 permil (5 permil) of the total cross section. The fully resummed\nresult shows an increase of about 5 permil of the total cross section with respect to the fixedorder result which stays roughly constant until \u2206E\u03b3 > 10 GeV. This is due to higher-order\nphoton radiation.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the binned distribution of the chargino production angle obtained using\na sample of unweighted events. It demonstrates that NLO corrections (which, for total cross\nsections, are in the percent regime and can reach 20% at the threshold) are important and\ncannot be accounted for by a constant K factor. Figure 4 shows the magnitude of second\nand higher order photonic effects in different schemes.\n\u221a Resummation effects are clearly in\nthe percent regime and cannot be neglected. For s > 500GeV, the convolution of the\ninterference term with fISR additionally changes the sign of the higher order corrections.\nFor more details, cf. [12, 13].\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have implemented NLO corrections into the event generator WHIZARD for chargino pairproduction at the ILC with several approaches for the inclusion of photon radiation. A\ncareful analysis of the dependence on the cuts \u2206 E\u03b3 , \u2206 \u03b8 reveals uncertainties related to\nhigher-order radiation and breakdown of the soft or collinear approximations. To carefully\nchoose the resummation method and cutoffs will be critical for a truly precise analysis of real\nILC data.The version of the program resumming photons allows to get rid of negative event\nweights, accounts for all yet known higher-order effects, allows for cutoffs small enough that\nsoft- and collinear-approximation artefacts are negligible, and explicitly generates photons\nwhere they can be resolved experimentally. Corrections for the decays of charginos and\nnon-factorizing corrections are in the line of future work.\nLCWS/ILC 2007\n\n\f2\u00d7104\n\n+\ne\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u03c7\u03031\n\n1000\n\nevt/bin\n500\n\n\u221a\n\nR\n\n1\u00d7104\n\n+\ne\u2212 e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n1 \u03c7\u03031\n\nevt/bin\n\ns = 1 TeV\nL = 1 ab\u22121\n\n0\n\u2212500\n\u22121000\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos \u03b8\n\n\u221a\nR\n\ns = 1 TeV\nL = 1 ab\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos \u03b8\n\nFigure 3: Polar scattering angle distribution for an integrated luminosity of 1 ab\u22121 at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 1 TeV.\nLeft: total number of events per bin; right: difference w.r.t. the Born distribution.
