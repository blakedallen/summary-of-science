We present CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) maps of the starburst/Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 2782 obtained with the\nIRAM interferometer, at 2.\u2032\u2032 1\u00d71.\u2032\u2032 5 and 0.\u2032\u2032 7\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 6 resolution respectively. The CO emission is aligned along the\nstellar nuclear bar of radius \u223c1 kpc, configured in an elongated structure with two spiral arms at high pitch angle\n\u223c 90\u25e6 . At the extremity of the nuclear bar, the CO changes direction to trace two more extended spiral features\nat a lower pitch angle. These are the beginning of two straight dust lanes, which are aligned parallel to an oval\ndistortion, reminiscent of a primary bar, almost perpendicular to the nuclear one. The two embedded bars appear\nin Spitzer IRAC near-infrared images, and HST color images, although highly obscured by dust in the latter.\nWe compute the torques exerted by the stellar bars on the gas, and find systematically negative average torques\ndown to the resolution limit of the images, providing evidence of gas inflow tantalizingly close to the nucleus of\nNGC 2782. We propose a dynamical scenario based on numerical simulations to interpret coherently the radio,\noptical, and molecular gas features in the center of the galaxy. Star formation is occurring in a partial ring at\n\u223c 1.3 kpc radius corresponding to the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) of the primary bar; this ring-like structure\nencircles the nuclear bar, and is studded with H\u03b1 emission. The gas traced by CO emission is driven inward by the\ngravity torques of the decoupled nuclear bar, since most of it is inside its corotation. N-body simulations, including\ngas dissipation, predict the secondary bar decoupling, the formation of the elongated ring at the \u223c1 kpc-radius\nILR of the primary bar, and the gas inflow to the ILR of the nuclear bar at a radius of \u223c200-300 pc. The presence\nof molecular gas inside the ILR of the primary bar, transported by a second nuclear bar, is a potential \"smoking\ngun\"; the gas there is certainly fueling the central starburst, and in a second step could fuel directly the AGN.\nKey words.

Introduction\n\nSend offprint requests to: hunt@arcetri.astro.it\n\u22c6\nBased on observations carried out with the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is supported by the\nINSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).\n\nMolecular gas is the dominant gas component in the inner\nregions of spiral galaxies, making CO lines unique tracers\nof nuclear gas dynamics. As such, they are also a powerful diagnostic for identifying how active nuclei (AGN)\nare fueled. To feed an AGN through accretion, there must\n\n\f2\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nbe an adequate supply of gas whose angular momentum\nhas been sufficiently reduced to enable inflow within the\nsmall spatial scales surrounding the black hole. Although\nthere is rarely a lack of circumnuclear fuel, it is not yet\nclear how angular momentum is removed to enable nuclear\naccretion.\nTo better understand how AGN are fed and maintained, we have been conducting for several years now\na high-resolution high-sensitivity CO survey (NUGA,\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2003) of galaxies at the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Altogether we\nhave observed 12 galaxies in two CO transitions with\nup to four configurations of the array, so as to achieve\nthe most sensitive (typically \u223c 2 \u2212 4 mJy beam\u22121 in\n10 km s\u22121 channels) and the highest resolution (1-2 \u2032\u2032 ) survey currently available. The results of the NUGA survey so far have been surprising: there is no single unambiguous circumnuclear molecular gas feature connected\nwith the nuclear activity. One- and two-armed instabilities\n(Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2003), well-ordered rings and nuclear spirals (Combes et al. 2004), circumnuclear asymmetries (Krips et al. 2005), and large-scale bars (Boone et al.\n2007) are among the variety of molecular gas morphologies revealed by our survey. Moreover, an analysis of\nthe torques exerted by the stellar gravitational potential on the molecular gas in four galaxies suggests that\nthe gas tends to be driven away from the the AGN\n> 50 pc), rather than toward it (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.\n(\u223c\n2005). Nevertheless, these dynamics do not correspond\nto the violent molecular outflows and superwinds predicted in AGN feedback models (e.g., Narayanan et al.\n2006; Hopkins & Hernquist 2006), because the observed\nvelocities are much too small.\nMuch of the explanation of this variety of morphologies\nappears to be related to timescales (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.\n2005). It is well established that large-scale bars transport gas inward very efficiently (e.g., Combes & Gerin\n1985; Sakamoto et al. 1999), and there is very little doubt\nthat bars can drive powerful starbursts (Knapen et al.\n2002; Jogee et al. 2005). However, no clear correlation\nbetween bars and nuclear activity has yet been found\n(e.g., Mulchaey & Regan 1997). This may be because\nthe timescales for bar-induced gas inflow and AGN\nduty cycles are very different. Bars drive inflow over\n>\ntimescales ( \u223c\n300 Myr) that are similar to the typical\ngas-consumption timescales of a few times \u223c 108 yr found\nin nuclear starbursts (e.g., Jogee et al. 2005). But AGN\naccretion-rate duty cycles are much shorter than this (\u223c110 Myr, Heckman et al. 2004; Hopkins & Hernquist 2006;\nKing & Pringle 2007), and there are several indications\nthat active accretion occurs only intermittently over the\nlifetime of a galaxy (Ferrarese et al. 2001; Marecki et al.\n2003; Janiuk et al. 2004; Hopkins & Hernquist 2006;\nKing & Pringle 2007). The resulting implication is that\nmost AGN are probably between active accretion episodes,\n\nand catching galaxies with nuclear accretion \"switched\non\" may be difficult.\nIn this paper, the ninth of the NUGA series, we present\nobservations that suggest that we have found one of these\npotentially rare AGN with possible gas inflow in the\ncurrent epoch. NGC 2782 is an early-type spiral galaxy\n[SABa(rs)] with peculiar morphology. In addition to a pronounced stellar tail or sheet \u223c20 kpc to the east, it shows\nthree optical ripples (e.g., Smith 1994) thought to be signatures of tidal interactions (Schweizer & Seitzer 1988).\nA massive Hi plume extends \u223c54 kpc to the northwest,\nand the neutral atomic gas in the inner disk is counterrotating with respect to the gas motions in the outer\nregions (Smith 1991). The central regions of NGC 2782\nhost a massive nuclear starburst, with a far-infrared\n(FIR) luminosity of 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , comparable to that in\nM 82 (Devereux 1989). Three-dimensional optical spectroscopy (Yoshida et al. 1999) shows evidence for a highspeed ionized gas outflow, with the bipolar structure in\nthe radio continuum indicative of a confined superbubble\n(Jogee et al. 1998). In the outflow, there are also highexcitation extranuclear emission lines thought to be due\nto shock heating (Boer et al. 1992).\nUntil recently, it was thought that the outflow and\nenergetics in NGC 2782 were powered by a starburst\nalone, but recent radio and X-ray observations reveal\nan optically-hidden AGN. MERLIN and EVN/VLBI observations show a high-brightness-temperature extremely\n\u2032\u2032\ncompact (<\n\u223c0. 05) radio source, unambiguous evidence of\nan AGN (Krips et al. 2007). NGC 2782 is also a Comptonthick X-ray source with a 6.4 keV iron feature coming from\nits innermost regions (Zhang et al. 2006). There is a bright\nunresolved X-ray core and extended emission roughly coincident with the radio morphology in the high-resolution\n(\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 ) image by Saikia et al. (1994).\nThe nuclear region of NGC 2782 has been observed previously in the 12 CO(1\u20130) line by Ishuzuki (1994) with the\nNobeyama Millimeter Array and by Jogee et al. (1999) using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. We reobserved\nNGC 2782 in 12 CO(1\u20130) at PdBI with better spatial resolution and a sensitivity roughly five times that of previous observations, and for the first time in the 12 CO(2\u20131)\nline. This enables a rigorous derivation of the torques acting on the molecular gas in NGC 2782, and a quantitative\nassessment of the infall of material to the nucleus. We\nfirst present our new observations in Section 2, together\nwith our multiwavelength imaging dataset. The morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas are discussed in\nSection 3, and we describe the stellar structure in Section\n4 and the starburst episode in Section 5. We then derive\nthe gravitational potential from the infrared image, and\ninfer the torques acting on the molecular gas in Section 6.\nFinally, we present numerical simulations which motivate\nour proposed scenario of decoupled double bars in this\ngalaxy. The molecular gas in NGC 2782 is apparently being driven inward by the nuclear bar, decoupled from the\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nprimary bar, since we detect azimuthally averaged torques\nwhich are negative down to the resolution limit of our images.\n\n2. Observations\nWe observed NGC 2782 with the IRAM PdBI in the\nABCD configuration of the array between December 2001\nand February 2003 in the 12 CO(1\u20130) (115 GHz) and the\n12\nCO(2\u20131) (230 GHz) rotational transitions. The PdBI receiver characteristics, the observing procedures, and the\nimage reconstruction are the same as those described in\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2003). The quasar 3C273 was used\nfor bandpass calibration and the quasar 0923+392 was\nused to calibrate both the phase and the atmospheric variations. We used uniform weighting to generate 2\u20131 maps\nwith a field of view of 21\u2032\u2032 and natural weighting to produce the 1\u20130 maps with a field of view of 42\u2032\u2032 . Such a\nprocedure maximizes the flux recovered in CO(1\u20130) and\noptimizes the spatial resolution in CO(2\u20131).\nThe rms noise \u03c3 in 10 km s\u22121 wide velocity channels is 2.0 mJy beam\u22121 and 5.2 mJy beam\u22121 , with beam\nsizes of 2.\u2032\u2032 1\u00d71.\u2032\u2032 5 and 0.\u2032\u2032 7\u00d70.\u2032\u2032 6 at 115 and 230 GHz,\nrespectively. At a level of \u223c 3\u03c3, no 3 mm (1 mm)\ncontinuum is detected toward NGC 2782 to a level of\n1 mJy beam\u22121 (3 mJy beam\u22121 ). The conversion factors between Jy beam\u22121 and K are 30 K Jy\u22121 beam at 115 GHz,\nand 58 K Jy\u22121 beam at 230 GHz. By default, all velocities are referred to the heliocentric recession velocity\nv0 = 2545 km s\u22121 and (\u2206\u03b1, \u2206\u03b4) offsets are relative to\nthe phase tracking center of the observations (RA2000 ,\nDec2000 )=(09h 14m 05.08s , 40d 06m 49.4s ). The displayed\nmaps are not corrected for primary beam attenuation.\nWe will assume a distance to NGC 2782 of D =35 Mpc,\nwhich is derived from the local velocity field model given\nin Mould et al. (2000) and a Hubble constant H0 =\n73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . At this distance 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to\n171 pc.\n\n2.1. Optical and infrared images\nWe retrieved HST archival images of NGC 2782 with\nWFPC2 in the F555W and F814W filters. Cosmic rays\nwere eliminated, and the images were calibrated and converted to V and I as described in Holtzman et al. (1995).\nWe performed an astrometric calibration using stars from\nthe U.S. Naval Observatory Astrometric Catalog B1.0\n(USNO-B1.0). Five stars from this catalogue appear in\nthe 1600\u00d71600 WFPC2 image of NGC 2782 and they were\nused to derive the astrometric solution with imwcs in the\nWCSTools package1 . The solution has an rms uncertainty\nof 0.\u2032\u2032 24, or 2.4 WFPC2 (mosaic) pixels, and differs from\n> 1\u2032\u2032 . We made V \u2212I color images\nthe original HST one by \u223c\n1\n\nAvailable from\nhttp://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools\n\n3\n\nby converting the flux units to magnitudes and subtracting the two magnitude images.\nIRAC images at 3.6 \u03bcm were retrieved from the\nSpitzer archive. We started with the Basic Calibrated\nData images, and aligned and combined them with\nMOPEX (Makovoz & Marleau 2005) which accounts for\ndistortion and rotates to a fiducial coordinate system.\n1.\u2032\u2032 20 pixels were imposed for the final image, roughly the\nsame as the original IRAC detector. Significant banding\nwas present from a bright star in the field, and this was\ncorrected for by interpolation over the affected rows before combination with MOPEX. Combination of these corrected images showed no discernible effect of the original\nflaw.\nThe infrared and optical images will be discussed in\nSections 4 and 5.\n\n3. Molecular gas results\nFigures 1 and 2 show the velocity-channel maps of\n12\nCO(1\u20130) and 12 CO(2\u20131) emission in the central region\nof NGC 2782. The kinematics show the typical signature of\na rotating disk, together with non-circular motions more\nprominent to the south. The western (eastern) side of the\nCO bar is red- (blue-) shifted relative to the systemic velocity Vsys , which is fitted to be at 2555\u00b110km s\u22121 . This\nagrees very well with the Hi heliocentric velocity of 2555\nkm s\u22121 (Smith 1994).\nThe dynamical center was derived from the center of\nsymmetry of the velocity field, and chosen to maximize\nthe velocity dispersion. It is determined to lie at (\u03b12000 ,\n\u03b42000 ) = (09h 14m 05.11s , 40\u25e6 06\u2032 49.24\u2032\u2032 ), not far from the\nphase-tracking center. The position of the dynamical\ncenter coincides almost exactly with the compact radio\nsource discovered by Krips et al. (2007): (\u03b12000 , \u03b42000 ) =\n(09h 14m 05.11s , 40\u25e6 06\u2032 49.32\u2032\u2032). Both are also within the errors of the position of the \"C\" component of the NGC 2782\nnucleus described by Saikia et al. (1994). Therefore we ascribe the position of the AGN and the dynamical center\nof NGC 2782 to the position derived here from the CO\nkinematics.\n\n3.1. CO morphology\nThe overall distribution of the molecular gas is illustrated in Figure 3 which shows the velocity-integrated\nCO intensity maps, achieved by integrating channels from\nv = \u2212230 to 230 km s\u22121 . The naturally weighted 12 CO(1\u2013\n0) map is shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, and the\nuniform-weight 12 CO(2\u20131) map in the bottom panel. After\ncorrecting for primary beam attenuation and considering\nonly measurements with a signal-to-noise of 3\u03c3 or greater\non the data cube, our naturally weighted (1\u20130) observations in the central 42\u2032\u2032 detect an integrated CO flux of\n150 Jy km s\u22121 . This corresponds to 65% of that in the Five\nCollege Radio Astronomy Observatory single dish mea-\n\n\f4\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nsurements (within 45\u2032\u2032 : 230 Jy km s\u22121 , Young et al. 1995),\nand roughly 78% of the flux measured by Jogee et al.\n(1999, 195 Jy km s\u22121 ). Our measurements are sensitive to\nsmall-scale structure but are missing some fraction of the\ndiffuse component. We use the short-spacing single dish\nobservations by Young et al. (1995) to derive the gas mass\nfor numerical simulations in Sect. 7.3.\n\n(1999). Our observations clearly delineate the diffuse spiral arms extending to the north and south. The spirals are\nnot symmetric, and there is substantially more emission\nto the southeast than to the northwest. The filaments at\n\u223c10\u2032\u2032 to the north and south in CO(1\u20130) correspond to\nthe spiral arms from the outer stellar oval (which we discuss in more detail below). Indeed, the CO \"spur\" labeled\n\"O2\" by Jogee et al. (1999) appears to be associated with\nthe extended southern spiral arm shown in our maps (see\nFig. 3).\nThe central structure in the 12 CO(2\u20131) map is clearly\nresolved; the higher resolution afforded by our new observations shows a clearly elongated structure with spiral\narms commencing at the ends of the elongation. The gas\nin the inner spiral arms is aligned along the elongation\nwith a pitch angle of \u223c 90\u25e6 , which makes the feature resemble more a bar than an inclined or edge-on disk. At\nthe end of the feature, the gas changes direction to follow\nthe outer spiral arms, which are situated at a lower pitch\nangle. Moreover, the molecular gas is clearly responding\nto the stellar oval/bar which we will discuss in Section 4.\nHence, we will refer to the circumnuclear molecular structure as the \"nuclear gas bar\", as distinct from the nuclear\nstellar bar (see below).\nThe molecular gas mass within the 42\u2032\u2032 PdB primary\nbeam field is MH2 = 1.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , assuming the CO-toH2 conversion factor X = 2.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121\ngiven by Solomon & Barrett (1991). Including the helium\nmass in the clouds (multiplying \u00d71.36) gives MH2 +He =\n1.9\u00d7109 M\u2299 . Most of the molecular gas mass in NGC 2782\nis in the nuclear gas bar+spiral, making it an extremely\nmassive structure. Indeed, the circumnuclear molecular gas component in NGC 2782 is particularly massive,\nroughly 3 times more so than most of the NUGA galaxies studied so far (NGC 4826: Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2003,\nNGC 7217: Combes et al. 2004, NGC 3718: Krips et al.\n2005 NGC 4579: Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2005, NGC 6951:\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2005 all have molecular masses on\nthe order of \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ). Only NGC 4569 (Boone et al.\n2007), with MH2 = 1.1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , is roughly comparable\nwith NGC 2782.\n\n3.2. Kinematics\n\n12\n\nFig. 3. Top panel: a) The natural-weight map in CO(1\u2013\n0) shown in grey scale with contours ranging from 0.5\nto 8.0 Jy km s\u22121 in 1 Jy km s\u22121 intervals.

The star marks the\nposition of the AGN (coincident with the dynamical center). The kinematic signature of a rotating disk is clearly\nseen in Fig. 4, and in the body of the circumnuclear molecular spiral, there are few non-circular motions. However,\nthe southern spiral arm in the CO(1\u20130) map (top panel of\nFig. 4) shows clear streaming motions, and appears to be\nsomewhat decoupled from the nuclear spiral because of the\nvelocity discontinuity toward the southeast. In the bottom\npanel of Fig. 4, systematic kinks appear in the CO(2\u20131)\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX.

Bottom panel:\nb) The same for 12 CO(2\u20131).\n12\n\nFig. 4. 12 CO(1\u20130) (a: top panel) and 12 CO(2\u20131) (b: bottom) isovelocities contoured over false-color velocity maps.\nThe AGN (dynamical center) position is marked with a\nstar.\nWe derive a kinematic major axis of PA = (75 \u00b1 5)\u25e6 ,\nconsistent with previous determinations (75\u25e6 , Jogee et al.\n1999). We will assume that the inclination angle of the\nnuclear spiral in NGC 2782 is \u223c30\u25e6 (see also Jogee et al.\n1999). A smaller inclination would result in sin i corrected\nvelocities which would be too large to be consistent with\neven the largest spiral galaxies and ellipticals. A larger\ninclination seems equally unlikely because of the relatively\nstraight extended spiral arms (see discussion in Sect. 5); if\n\nPosition-velocity (PV) diagrams along the major kinematic axis of NGC 2782 are shown in Fig. 5, and along\nthe minor axis in Fig. 6. In both figures, 12 CO(1\u20130) is\ngiven in the top panel, and 12 CO(2\u20131) in the bottom.\nThe top panel of Fig. 5 reveals regular circular rotation together with mild streaming motions in the molecular gas. However, the rough alignment of the molecular\nfeature at PA\u223c88\u25e6 with the line-of-nodes of the galaxy\n(PA\u223c 72 \u2212 73\u25e6 , see Sect. 4) inhibits a clear signature of\nnon-circular streaming motions. Consequently, the majoraxis PV diagram cannot provide conclusive evidence for\n\n\f6\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX.

The\nfinal RC is shown in Sect. 7.2 in the context of our numerical simulations.\nThe peak velocity is \u223c 170/ sin i km s\u22121 , or\n\u223c340 km s\u22121 for i = 30\u25e6 , obtained at a radius of 850 pc\n(5\u2032\u2032 ) to the south, but at \u223c1 kpc (\u223c6\u2032\u2032 ) in the RC obtained\nfrom averaging both lines and both sides of the major axis.\nFrom the peak velocity, we can derive a rough estimate of\nthe dynamical mass: M (R) = 2.32 \u00d7 105 R V 2 (R) where\nM (R) is in M\u2299 , R in kpc, and V in km s\u22121 . Assuming the\nmost flattened disk-like distribution (i.e., including a multiplicative constant of 0.6), at a radius of 1 kpc, we would\nfind Mdyn = 1.6\u00d71010 M\u2299 . Within a 1.7 kpc radius, where\nvirtually all of the observed molecular gas is located, assuming a flat rotation curve (see Sect. 7.2), we would infer Mdyn = 2.7 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . Comparing with the mass in\nmolecular gas including helium would give a molecular\nmass fraction of \u223c7% in this region, in agreement with\nJogee et al. (1999).\n\n4. Stellar structure\nFig. 6.

The\nkinematics shown by the minor-axis PV in Fig. 6 are quite\nregular in the extended regions, but show significant velocity dispersion close to the nucleus. This could reflect\nan unresolved rotational velocity component, suggesting\na large central dynamical mass (see below). Finally, Fig. 6\nshows no evidence for molecular gas outflow, as tentatively\nsuggested by Jogee et al. (1999).\n\n3.3. The rotation curve and dynamical mass\nWe have derived a rotation curve (RC) from the PV diagram taken along the kinematic major axis of NGC 2782\nat a PA = 75 \u25e6 . The terminal velocities were derived by\nfitting multiple Gaussian profiles to the spectra across\nthe major axis. The fitted velocity centroids, corrected\nfor sin i (i = 30\u25e6 ), give Vrot for each galactocentric distance. Although for both lines the RCs to the south (nega-\n\nFigure 7 shows the CO(1\u20130) and (2\u20131) total intensity maps\noverlaid on the IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image described in Sect. 2.1.\nThis wavelength traces very well the massive component\nof the stellar populations in galaxies, and has the added\nadvantage of very low extinction even compared to the\nK band. Two main inner structures can be seen in Fig.\n7: an inner stellar bar/oval with a PA\u223c88\u25e6 and diameter of \u223c15\u2032\u2032 , and an outer oval at PA\u223c10\u25e6 and diameter of \u223c30\u2032\u20322 . Previous K-band observations (Jogee et al.\n1999) identified similar features, but with slightly different\nPA's and a larger radius for the outer oval than we find\nhere (25\u2032\u2032 vs. \u223c15\u2032\u2032 ). Both structures are clearly present\nin NGC 2782, and as we shall see in Sect. 6, contribute to\nthe dynamical perturbations in this galaxy.\nA large-scale view of NGC 2782 at 3.6 \u03bcm is illustrated\nin (the left panel of) Fig. 8. The detached stellar sheet or\ntail outside the main galaxy disk is evident to the east,\nand the elongation or distortion of the disk to the west\nis clearly visible. There are also stellar arcs or \"ripples\"\n(Smith 1994; Jogee et al. 1999) about 25\u2032\u2032 to the west of\nthe nucleus. All these features are seen in optical images\n(Smith 1994; Jogee et al. 1999) and in Hi (Smith 1991).\nMoreover, in Hi, there is a long (\u223c 54 kpc) plume or tidal\ntail extending to the north, with its origin at the westernmost edge of the distorted disk (Smith 1991).\n2\n\nThese values have been derived by fitting elliptical\nisophotes to the image with the task ellipse in the\nIRAF/STSDAS package.\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX.

In both panels, the\nAGN (dynamical center) position is marked with a star.\n\n4.1. Bulge/disk decomposition\nTo better understand the mass distribution and investigate the non-axisymmetric structure in the stars, we performed a two-dimensional bulge/disk decomposition on\nthe IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image of NGC 2782 with galfit, the publicly available algorithm developed by Peng et al. (2002).\nThe MOPEX point-response function was used for convolution with the image, and the background sky level was\nfixed to the measured value rather than fit. Initial parameters for bulge and disk were guessed by using the scaling\n\n7\n\nrelations given by Moriondo et al. (1998) and Hunt et al.\n(2004). The final best fit was achieved with a generalized\nexponential (Sersic) bulge, an exponential disk, and a nuclear point source.\nWe ran several sets of fits, in order to experiment with\nmasking the stellar tails or sheets predominant to the east.\nFitting the whole image (\u223c3.4\u2032 diameter) results in a bulge\nwith shape index n = 3 (a de Vaucouleurs bulge has\nn = 4), an effective radius of 1.1 kpc and an apparent\ninclination of 32\u25e6 . This bulge contains about 60% of the\ntotal 3.6 \u03bcm light. The resulting disk, with a scalelength of\n2.9 kpc and an inclination of 41\u25e6 , together with a nuclear\npoint source contribute about 33% and 7%, respectively,\nto the total luminosity. The fitted aspect ratio of the disk\nis very close to that given for NGC 2782 in NED, which\ncorresponds to a system inclination of 42\u25e6 . The bulge PA\nof 19\u25e6 is ill-determined because of its low apparent flattening, but the fitted orientation of the disk (PA = 73\u25e6 )\nis consistent with the angle of the line-of-nodes estimated\nby Jogee et al. (1999) and with the kinematical major axis\nfound in Sect.3.2.\nMasking the stellar \"sheets\", and confining the fit to\nthe undisturbed portion of the outer regions (within a\n\u223c2.4\u2032 diameter, 24 kpc) gives a slightly different, probably\nmore reliable, fit. The bulge has a steeper shape index\n(n = 4), the nuclear point source is smaller, and the disk\nis less inclined. The fraction of bulge-to-total luminosity\nremains the same, \u223c60%. The masked fits give a disk inclination of 33\u25e6 , more similar to that of the bulge, and more\nconsistent with the visual aspect of the galaxy. Indeed, inspection of Fig. 8 suggests a strikingly round appearance,\nat least in the regular portion of the disk out to a radius of\n\u2032\u2032\n>\n\u223c50 (\u223c9 kpc). This impression is confirmed by fitting the\nisophotes to ellipses3 which shows that at galactocentric\ndistances as large as 12.5 kpc, the fitted system ellipticity\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nimplies an inclination of <\n\u223c 33 at PA = 72 . Hence, we\nconfirm \u223c30\u25e6 for the system inclination (as described in\nSect. 3.2), obtained with the masked bulge-disk decomposition.\nThe fit provides a convenient axisymmetric model for\nunsharp masking. The large-scale residuals from the fit described above are shown in the right panel of Fig. 8. The\ncorrespondence with the features in the unsharp masked\noptical images (Smith 1994) is excellent. The stellar sheet\nto the east, and the ripples and distortion of the disk to\nthe west, are clearly revealed. The small-scale residuals\nof the bulge/disk decomposition are shown in Fig. 9 with\nCO(1-0) (left panel) and CO(2\u20131) (right) overlaid in contours; both the \"masked\" fits and the fits to the entire image give virtually identical residuals in the circumnuclear\nregion. The large (1.\u2032\u2032 2) pixels of the IRAC image impede\ndetailed comparison, but the residuals from the fit have an\nm = 2 structure, and strongly resemble a stellar bar. Some\nsmall component of residuals could perhaps be hot dust\n3\n\nWith the task ellipse in the IRAF/STSDAS package.\n\n\f8\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nrather than stars, because of the red K \u2212 L color excess\nobserved in the center of NGC 2782 (Hunt & Giovanardi\n1992). Nevertheless, dust cannot contribute significantly\nto the structure of the residuals because the K \u2212 L color\nis redder outside the bar-like structure than within it. In\nfact, the position of the bar-like residuals coincides perfectly with the CO emission, and provides a classic illustration of the theoretical behavior of the spiral response\nof a gas component to bar forcing. In this case, the gas is\nphase shifted in advance relative to the bar (leading), as\ncan be seen to the northeast and the southwest in the \"S\"\nshape of the spiral.\n\n5. Star formation and dust in NGC 2782\nWhile stellar structure can be more readily inferred\nfrom near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, dust extinction\nand star formation are best investigated in the optical.\nFigure 10 shows the CO intensity maps overlaid on the\nHST/WFPC2 F814W image. The F814W emission of the\ncircumnuclear region shows a strong asymmetric excess\nto the northwest of the AGN (hereafter called the \"NW\nexcess\"), roughly coincident with the structure in the H\u03b1\nmaps (Jogee et al. 1999). This excess is contiguous with\nan entire arc of bright knots to the north running from east\nto west, again reflecting the H\u03b1 emission-line morphology.\nPart of this arc lies within the 12 CO(2\u20131) emission, while\nthe excess to the northwest is outside of it. There is also\nan extended F814W excess generally to the south, leading\nto a lopsided appearance at this wavelength.\nFigure 11 presents the CO intensity maps overlaid on\nthe HST/WFPC2 V \u2212 I image described in Sect. 2.1. The\nred V \u2212I color delineating the spiral arm to the northwest\nis neatly traced by the CO(1\u20130) emission. This red arm\nconnects to the CO spiral with a hook-like structure which\nwinds around the NW excess, following the CO emission\nto the nucleus. The blue V \u2212 I colors of the F814W arc to\nthe north of the AGN suggest that it is tracing the same\nstar-formation episode revealed by H\u03b1.\nThis northern arc of star formation was identified\nby Jogee et al. (1998) and Jogee et al. (1999), and occurs roughly cospatially with an outflow thought to be\ndriven by the starburst. The outflow is seen at radio wavelengths and in optical emission lines (Boer et al. 1992;\nSaikia et al. 1994; Jogee et al. 1998; Yoshida et al. 1999;\nJogee et al. 1999). It is relatively north-south symmetric\nin the 6 cm radio continuum (Saikia et al. 1994), but has\nthe form of a \"mushroom\" in the optical (clearly illustrated by Fig. 8 in Jogee et al. 1999). The arc defines the\n\"cap\" of the mushroom, and the slightly narrower \"stem\"\nextends southward, ending at the blue knot roughly \u223c7\u2032\u2032\nsouth and 1\u2032\u2032 east of the nucleus. This mushroom shape\nis not clearly seen in the V \u2212 I image. The roughly normal V \u2212 I colors (\u223c0.8\u20131) to the south of the CO(2\u20131)\nemission suggest that the unreddened stellar population\n\nFig. 10. Top panel: a) 12 CO(1\u20130) total intensity\ncontoured over a false-color representation of the\nHST/WFPC2 F814W image of NGC 2782. Bottom panel:\nb) The same for 12 CO(2\u20131). In both panels, the AGN (dynamical center) position is marked with a star.\n\nof the bulge is obscuring the star formation to the south,\na conclusion which we will motivate in the following.\nThe three-dimensional orientation of the galaxy disk\ncan be inferred on the basis of the red V \u2212 I colors in\nthe extended spiral arm in the northwest. The roughly\nsymmetric spiral arm to the southeast is not reddened,\nimplying that the spiral structure to the northwest is being seen through an obscuring dust lane, coplanar with\nthe inclined stellar disk. If this is true, then the north\nwould be the near side of the disk, and the south would\nbe the far side. This orientation would also mean that the\nspiral arms are trailing, which is the most probable configuration. The implication is that, toward the south, the\nstellar disk is seen through the intervening bulge. The rel-\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\n9\n\nfront of the intervening dust lane, while to the north, dust\nobscures more of the bulge because most of the bulge light\nis behind it. This interpretation would also help explain\nthe F814W image with its apparent lopsidedness to the\nsouth. In any case, the dust must be clumpy, and inhomogeneities in the dust distribution allow random regions\nbehind the dust to shine through.\nThe AGN (dynamical center) is located at the northwest border of a tiny red arc \u223c80 pc to the southeast (\"parachute\"-like, see Fig. 11). In this region, there\nare broad H\u03b1 lines which show considerable north-south\nasymmetry, unlike the narrow component of the emission\nlines which is relatively symmetric (Yoshida et al. 1999).\nInterestingly, this red arc in the color map is at the same\nposition as the velocity discontinuities in the CO(2\u20131) spider diagrams (see Sect. 3.2). Because of the feature's extremely small size, we can not make any reliable statements, but speculate that it could be the color (and kinematic) signature of a small-scale AGN outflow out of the\nplane of the disk.\n\n6. Gravitational torques on the molecular gas\n\nFig. 11. Top panel: a) 12 CO(1\u20130) total intensity\ncontoured over a false-color representation of the\nHST/WFPC2 V \u2212 I image of NGC 2782. The spiral arm\nto the northwest is clearly traced by the CO(1\u20130) emission. Bottom panel: b) The same for 12 CO(2\u20131). In both\npanels, the AGN (dynamical center) position is marked\nwith a star.\n\natively small bulge effective scalelength of 5\u2032\u2032 \u22126\u2032\u2032 means\nthat \u223c50% of the bulge light lies within the region of the\nCO emission. To the south, the bulge stars with normal\nV \u2212 I colors are overwhelming the young blue stars in\nthe star-formation event. Hence, the southern part of the\n\"mushroom\" structure is not observed in V \u2212 I, but in\nemission lines, since the bulge is not expected to contain\na significant amount of dust, nor does it emit contaminating line emission. To the south most of the bulge is in\n\nStreaming motions along the bar led Jogee et al. (1999) to\nconclude that there could be gas inflow feeding the starburst. However, streaming motions by themselves do not\nimply any transfer of angular momentum, nor can they be\nused to infer the direction of such transfer. Hence, we now\nexamine the torques exerted by the stellar potential on the\nmolecular gas in NGC 2782, in order to assess whether\nthe gas is, on average, flowing in or out. Although our\nPdBI map recovers \u223c65% of that from single-dish measurements, in the following analysis what matters is the\nstructured gas component. The diffuse large-scale molecular gas contributes equal quantities of positive and negative torques on the gas orbits; hence it does not influence\nthe net torque.\nThere is no clear evidence for non-coplanarity of the\nCO nuclear bar+spiral and the large-scale stellar disk.\nThe stellar bar is oriented at PA\u223c 88\u25e6 , and the kinematic major axis at \u223c 75\u25e6 , somewhat hampering the identification of non-circular motions. Nevertheless, were the\ntwo structures to be non-coplanar, we would expect to\nsee some kinematic evidence which is not seen. Hence,\nin disagreement with the schematic model presented by\nYoshida et al. (1999), in what follows, we assume that all\nthe flattened structures (nuclear CO spiral, nuclear stellar\nbar, and outer stellar oval) lie within the same disk plane.\nTo derive the torques exerted by the stars on the gas,\nwe adopt the method presented in Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al.\n(2005) which relies on a stellar potential \u03a6 derived from\na NIR image and on the gas response as inferred from the\nCO maps. We assume that the total mass is determined\nby the stars, essentially invoking an extreme \"maximum\ndisk\" solution (e.g., Kent 1987), in which the gas selfgravity and the dark matter halo are neglected. We fur-\n\n\f10\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nther assume that the measured gas column density N (x, y)\nderived from the CO total intensity maps is a reliable estimate of the probability of finding gas at (x, y) in the\ncurrent epoch. This is reasonable, namely that CO traces\nthe total gas content, since atomic gas in the nuclei of\ngalaxies is typically a very small fraction of the total gas\nmass.\nAs emphasized in Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2005), a single key assumption underlies the validity of our estimate\nof angular momentum transfer in the gas: we implicitly\nassume that the gas response to the stellar potential is\nroughly stationary in the reference frame of the potential\nover a few rotation periods. This would not be the case\nin the presence of strong self-gravity in the gaseous components. However, otherwise, even in galaxies with several stellar pattern speeds at different radii in the disk,\nnumerical simulations suggest that the gas response adjusts its response to the dominant stellar configuration at\na given radius (see Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2005, and references therein).\n\n6.1. The stellar potential\nThe stellar potential in NGC 2782 was derived from the\nIRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image by first rebinning to 0.\u2032\u2032 15 pixels, then\ndeprojecting with a PA = 75\u25e6 and an inclination of 30\u25e6 . To\naccount for the vertical mass distribution, the rebinned deprojected image was convolved with an isothermal plane\nmodel of constant scale height \u223c1/12th of the radial disk\nscalelength (e.g., Quillen et al. 1994; Buta & Block 2001).\nFigure 12 shows the deprojected IRAC image, with the\n12\nCO(1\u20130) and 12 CO(2\u20131) total intensity maps superimposed in contours. The orientations of the stellar outer\noval and the nuclear oval/bar are clearly visible even in\nthe deprojected image and are marked with a solid line.\nIn the absence of extinction and stellar population\ngradients, the mass-to-light ratio can be assumed to be\nconstant across this deprojected (face-on) galaxy image\n(e.g., Freeman 1992; Persic et al. 1996); the mass is therefore directly proportional to the 3.6 \u03bcm light distribution.\nWith this assumption, we derive the potential \u03a6 by solving\nthe Poisson equation: \u2206\u03a6 = 4 \u03c0 G \u03c1 using a Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) technique on a 256\u00d7256 Cartesian grid\nas in Combes et al. (1990). Beyond a radius of 3.4 kpc, \u03c1\nis set to 0, thus suppressing any spurious m = 4 terms\nin the derived potential. This is adequate to compute \u03a6\nin the central regions of the galaxy sampled by the PdB\nCO(1\u20130) primary beam.\nFollowing Combes & Sanders (1981), we then expand\nthe potential \u03a6 in Fourier components:\n\u03a6(R, \u03b8) = \u03a60 (R) +\n\nX\n\n\u03a6m (R) cos[m(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8m )]\n\n(1)\n\nm\n\nand use a polar Fourier transform method to isolate the\nvarious angular modes \u03a6m . It is convenient to represent\n\neach m-Fourier amplitude by the normalized ratio Qm (R):\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03a60 (R)\nm\n(2)\n\u03a6m (R)/\nQm (R) =\nR\n\u2202R\n= m\u03a6m /R|F0 (R)|\nwhich is the amplitude of the mth harmonic of the force\nrelative to the total axisymmetric component. These are\nessentially the harmonics of the angular derivatives of\nthe potential, expressed as normalized Fourier amplitudes. Figure 13 gives the radial run of the highest-order\nQm (R) coefficients. The nuclear (R\u22431 kpc) and the primary (R\u22432.6 kpc) bars are clearly evident as local maxima (see left panel); moreover, the phase angle changes as\nwould be expected for the \u223c 90\u25e6 transition from the nuclear to the primary bar (Q2 shown as a solid line, right\npanel).\n\n6.2. Derivation of the torques\nThe angular derivative of the potential \u03a6(R, \u03b8) gives at\neach location the torque field per unit mass \u03c4 (x, y) =\nxFy \u2212 yFx ; by definition \u03c4 (x, y) is independent of the\ngas distribution in the plane of the galaxy. The azimuthal average of \u03c4 , using N (x, y) as the weighting function, corresponds to the global variation of the specific\ngas angular momentum transfer occurring at this radius\n(dLs (x, y)/dt|\u03b8 ). The \u03b8 subscript indicates an azimuthal\naverage, evaluated at a given radius R(x, y). For convenience of calculation on a pixelized image, we express the\ntorques in Cartesian coordinates.\nThe rotation direction of the gas in the galaxy disk\ndetermines the sign of \u03c4 (x, y): positive (negative) if the\ntorque drives the gas outward (inward) at (x, y). To calculate the effective variations of angular momentum in the\ngalaxy plane, we then weight the torques by the gas column densities N (x, y) derived from the 12 CO(1\u20130) and 2\u20131\nlines: \u03c4 (x, y)N (x, y). Fig. 14 shows the normalized version\nof these maps \u03c4 \u2032 where we have divided \u03c4 (x, y)N (x, y) by\nthe azimuthal average of the gas density. The \u2032 superscript\nindicates this normalized \u03c4 , so that we can use dimensionless quantities (both in Cartesian coordinates and below\nin polar ones). Both panels in Fig. 14 show the typical\n\"butterfly\" diagram due to an m = 2 perturbation (e.g.\nButa & Block 2001; Laurikainen & Salo 2002).\nThe radial gas flow induced by the torques is estimated\nby azimuthally averaging the effective variations of angular momentum density in the plane:\nR\nN (x, y) \u00d7 (x Fy \u2212 y Fx )\n\u2032\nR\n(3)\n\u03c4 (R) = \u03b8\nN (x, y)\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c4 \u2032 (R), by definition, represents the azimuthally-averaged\ntime derivative of the specific angular momentum Ls .\nAzimuthal averages are derived with a radial binning commensurate with the 1.\u2032\u2032 2 resolution of the IRAC image.\nSimilarly to the torque maps (e.g., Fig. 14), the sign of\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\n11\n\n\u03c4 \u2032 (R) defines whether the gas is subject to a net gain (+)\nor loss (\u2212) of angular momentum. Specifically, we assess\nthe efficiency of the AGN fueling by estimating the average fraction of the gas angular momentum transferred in\none rotation period by the stellar potential. This is done as\na function of radius by defining the dimensionless function\n\u2206L/L:\ndL\n\u2206L\n=\nL\ndt\n\n\u00d7\n\u03b8\n\n1\nL\n\n\u00d7 Trot =\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c4 \u2032 (R)\n\u00d7 Trot\nL\u03b8\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Trot is the rotation period, and L\u03b8 is assumed to\nbe well represented by its azimuthal average, i.e., L\u03b8 =\nR \u00d7 vrot . The absolute value of L/\u2206L dictates how much\ntime the stellar potential will need to transfer the entirety\nof the total gas angular momentum. Assuming that the\ngas response to the stellar potential is stationary with respect to the potential reference frame during a few rotation periods, a small value of \u2206L/L implies that the stellar potential is inefficient at present. Figure 15 shows the\n\u2206L/L relative torques derived from CO(1\u20130) (top panel)\nand 2\u20131 (bottom). Because of the limited resolution in the\nIRAC image (1 pixel\u2243200 pc), we have masked the inner\npixel. Beyond a radius of \u223c1.9 kpc, the 12 CO(2\u20131) emission is less well sampled than 12 CO(1\u20130) because of the\nsmaller beam size (\u223c22\u2032\u2032 ). The two CO lines are thus complementary, as 12 CO(1\u20130) effectively traces the torques\nbeyond this radius, but at a more moderate spatial resolution than 12 CO(2\u20131). It is evident that both lines give\nsimilar results, in the sense that we see systematically negative average torques in the inner few kpc.\n\nFig. 15. Top panel: a) The relative torque in dimensionless units of dL/L derived using the potential obtained\nfrom the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image (1.2\u2032\u2032 pixels, undersampled beam). Bottom panel: b) The same for 12 CO(2\u2013\n1). The 12 CO(2\u20131) emission is less well sampled than\n12\nCO(1\u20130) beyond a radius of \u223c1.9 kpc, because of the\nsmaller beam size (FWHP\u223c22\u2032\u2032 ). Despite the relatively\npoor resolution of the gravitational potential image, both\nCO transitions give similar results; we see systematically\nnegative average torques within the entire region probed by\nour observations.\n\n7. Understanding the torques in NGC 2782\nThe other galaxies in the NUGA sample analyzed\nso far (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2003; Combes et al. 2004;\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2005; Boone et al. 2007) mainly show\npositive torques near the nucleus, with negative torques\nat varying amplitudes only for radii >\n\u223c500 pc. Only in\nNGC 4579 are the average torques negative down to\n200 pc, but the spatial resolution of the torque map for\nthat galaxy is sufficiently good that we can see that, inside that radius, the gas is flowing away from the nucleus.\nNGC 2782 is the first galaxy in our sample that shows systematically negative torques down to the resolution limit\nimposed by our torque image. Moreover, in the entire region probed by our CO maps, nowhere is the gas subjected\nto average positive torques. The relatively poor resolution\n(1.\u2032\u2032 2) of the potential map (IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm) makes it impossible to assess the torque amplitude inside a radius of\n200 pc4 . Indeed, the slightly positive torques in Fig. 15 are\nunreliable, and may simply be an artefact of insufficient\n4\nAs in Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. (2005), we attempted to use the\nHST WFPC2 F814W image corrected for extinction. However,\nin NGC 2782, the extinction correction proved to be unreliable,\nand we were forced to rely only on the Spitzer/IRAC image.\n\nspatial resolution. Nevertheless, the systematically negative trend of the average torques in NGC 2782 hints that\ngas is being transported tantalizingly close to the AGN.\nThis gas is certainly fuelling the nuclear starburst, and\nmay, subsequently, be feeding the AGN. In the following,\nwe develop a dynamical scenario which will explain why\nwe think this occurs in NGC 2782.\n\n7.1. Main features\nAlthough the outer parts of NGC 2782 show clear signs\nof a past interaction (tidal tails, distorted disk, stellar\nsheets), the inner parts appear dynamically relaxed, not\nunexpectedly since the dynamical timescale is shorter by\none or two orders of magnitude at r\u223c 1kpc, than at r\u223c\n20kpc.\nThe previous sections have shown that NGC 2782 contains many features of a double-barred galaxy. Although\nthe nuclear bar is unfortunately almost aligned with the\ngalaxy line of nodes, the disk is nearly face-on (30\u25e6 ), which\nhelps to distinguish the morphological features. In the\n\n\f12\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nnear-infrared, there is a nuclear stellar bar of radius \u223c\n1 kpc, embedded within an outer stellar oval of radius \u223c\n2.5 kpc. This outer oval, which we will call the primary\nbar, is oriented at PA \u223c10\u25e6 , misaligned (and not quite\nperpendicular) with the nuclear stellar bar at PA\u223c88\u25e6 .\nThe molecular gas distribution is mainly elongated along\nthe nuclear bar, and reveals two spiral features emerging\nfrom its ends, aligned with the conspicuous dust lanes already noted by Jogee et al. (1998, 1999). These dust lanes\nare strikingly straight, reminiscent of barred galaxies with\ndust lanes parallel to the bar, but located on the bar's\nleading edge on either side of the nucleus. We therefore interpret the large-scale CO(1\u20130) features corresponding to\nthe straight dust lanes as the gas response to the primary\nbar; they have indeed a similar orientation. The inner elongated molecular morphology, evident in both CO(1\u20130) and\nCO(2\u20131), constitutes the gas response to the nuclear bar.\nThe H\u03b1 morphology is more puzzling, because of a\nclumpy dust obscuration which masks part of it. As noted\nby Jogee et al. (1998), there are two main features in H\u03b1:\none is the outflow driven by the starburst, perpendicular to the nuclear stellar bar, and aligned with the radio\ncontinuum outflow (Saikia et al. 1994), and the other is\nthe elongated ring, of about 1 kpc in radius, encircling the\nnuclear bar. The ring is particularly demarcated on the\nnorthern side, where it forms a 180\u25e6 arc, making the structure resemble more a half-ring or what we called the \"cap\nof the mushroom\" in Sect. 5. But there is also a southern equivalent (dubbed the \"mushroom stem\"), largely\nobscured by dust. Toward the west, there is a remarkable\ndust finger, devouring the ring, which superposes quite\nwell with the CO distribution (see Fig. 11).\nThe two different H\u03b1 components are well distinguished by their different kinematics: large outflowing velocities in the north-south component (bubble to the south\nin front of the dust lane, and obscured flow in the north behind it), and a normally rotating ring around the nuclear\nbar (Yoshida et al. 1999). We interpret the low-velocity\nrotating component as the nuclear ring, associated with\nthe inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the primary bar,\nand encircling the nuclear bar, i.e. close to the corotation\n(CR) of the nuclear bar (more exactly at the UHR, or\n4:1 resonance). The dust features are more conspicuous\ntoward the north because the near side is the north side.\nThe bulge is more evident toward the south, masking the\ndust obscuration from the disk's far side. But this does\nnot imply that there is no dust and gas there, obscuring\nthe southern half-ring in H\u03b1: on the contrary, there is CO\nemission in this southern part, coinciding with holes in the\nH\u03b1 distribution.\nThe H\u03b1 emission is the most intense in the partial\nring, which lends support to our ILR interpretation, since\nit is well-known that resonances are locations where the\ngas is transiently stalled due to the torques provided by\nthe stellar bar. Thus, the gas has time to form young\nstars, as typically revealed in many barred galaxies, such\n\nas NGC 2997, NGC 4314, or NGC 4321 (Maoz et al. 1996;\nBenedict et al. 2002; Allard et al. 2006). In the case of\nNGC 2782, because of the secondary bar, gas is then driven\nfurther inward, as suggested by the CO straight spiral\narms (pitch angle close to 90\u25e6 ) aligned with the nuclear\nbar. This gas also forms stars, explaining the presence of\nH\u03b1 also in the nuclear disk.\n\n7.2. Dynamical interpretation\nThe dynamical scenario we propose to explain these main\nfeatures is the following: first a primary bar forms, most\nlikely triggered by the interaction that gave rise to the disturbed morphology in the outer parts of NGC 2782. The\ngravity torques from this primary bar drive the gas inward, and create a gaseous nuclear ring at its ILR. Intense\nstar formation gives rise to the H\u03b1 nuclear ring, seen now\nas a sharp half-ring arc. In the meantime, the gas inflow\nhas weakened the primary bar (e.g., Bournaud & Combes\n2002; Bournaud et al. 2005), and a nuclear bar has dynamically decoupled, rotating at a different pattern speed.\nThe two different pattern speeds are usually such that the\ncorotation of the nuclear bar corresponds to the ILR of the\nprimary bar, thus avoiding excessive chaos in the orbits\n(Friedli & Martinet 1993). The nuclear bar then governs\nthe gas inflow toward the center. Instead of being stalled\nat the primary ILR, now the gas is subject to the negative gravity torques of the secondary bar, between its CR\nand its own ILR. This explains why we see CO emission\ninside the ILR of the primary bar, and why the torques\ncomputation reveals that gas is flowing inward toward the\ncenter.\nThis scenario is slightly different from one where the\ngas decouples from the stars to form a gaseous nuclear\nbar with a faster (Englmaier & Shlosman 2004) or slower\n(Heller et al. 2001) pattern speed than the primary bar.\nWe propose here that the nuclear bar exists both in the\nstellar and gaseous components, and always with a higher\npattern speed than the primary.\n\n7.3. Numerical techniques\nTo better understand the physical mechanisms, and reproduce the observed morphology, we performed N-body\nsimulations with stars and gas, including star formation.\nWe believe that the nuclear bar decoupling is a disk phenomenon, occurring on short timescales, with little contribution of a slowly rotating spherical component, such\nas a bulge or dark matter halo, so we adopt the simplification of 2D simulations, with the spherical components\nadded analytically. Self-gravity is included only for the\ndisk (gas+stars).\nThe N-body simulations were carried out using the\nFFT algorithm to solve the Poisson equation, with two\nkinds of grids: Cartesian and polar, the latter optimizing the spatial resolution toward the center. The useful\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nCartesian grid was 256\u00d7256 (or 512\u00d7512 in total to avoid\nperiodic images), with a total radius of 8 kpc. The cell size\nis then 62 pc. The softening was taken as 250 pc, in order\nto roughly reproduce the actual effective softening from\nthe thickness of the disk. The polar grid is composed of\nNR= 80 radial, and NT= 96 azimuthal separations. The\nradial spacing of the grid is exponential at large scales,\nand linear at small scales, following the prescription by\nPfenniger & Friedli (1993). The polar-grid cell size ranges\nfrom 10 pc at the center to \u223c1 kpc at the outskirts (at\n22 kpc). The minimum softening is also fixed at 250 pc,\nand is larger in the outer regions. The two different kinds\nof simulations, polar and Cartesian, were performed separately, in order to gauge the effect of different spatial\nresolution on the results; both methods give similar outcomes.\nThe stellar component is represented by 120000 particles, and the gas component by 40000. Two rigid spherical\npotentials are added analytically, with a Plummer shape:\nGMb,h\n\u03a6b,h (r) = \u2212 q\n2\nr2 + rb,h\nwhere Mb and rb are the mass and characteristic radius\nof the stellar spherical component (bulge), and Mh and\nrh are the equivalent quantities for the dark-matter halo.\nThese parameters are selected to fit the rotation curve of\nNGC 2782, and are reported in Table 1.\nThe stellar disk is initially a Kuzmin-Toomre disk of\nsurface density:\n\u03a3(r) = \u03a30 (1 + r2 /rd2 )\u22123/2\nwith mass Md , rd = 3.25 kpc, and truncated at 7 kpc. It\nis initially quite cold, with a Toomre Q parameter of 1.2.\nThe gas distribution is initially similar to the stellar one,\nwith Qgas =1. The time step is 0.1 Myr. The initial conditions of the runs described here are given in Table 1.\nThe component subscripts refer to the bulge (\"b\"), and\nthe halo (\"h\") which are rigid, and the disk (\"d\") which\nis \"live\".\n\nTable 1.

The\ninitial gas-to-total mass ratio (Fgas ) ranges between 5\nand 10%. Star formation is included, with a conventional\nSchmidt-law recipe, although this will not be discussed\nhere, since the timescales are short enough that the gas depletion is not significant. At the present time, the observed\ngas mass in NGC 2782 within a \u223c3 kpc radius is about\n3 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 5 . The gas clouds are subject to inelastic collisions, with a collision cell size of 67 pc for the Cartesian\ncode, and 117 pc for the polar code (region where particles are selected to possibly collide). This corresponds to\na lower limit for the average mean free path of clouds between two collisions. The collisions are considered every\n2 Myr. In a collision, the sign of the relative cloud velocities is reversed and the absolute values are reduced:\nrelative velocities after the collision are only 0.65 times\ntheir original value. The dissipation rate is controlled by\nthis factor. All gas particles have the same mass.\nThe rotation curve corresponding to Run A is plotted in comparison to the empirical RC (see Sect. 3.3) in\nFig. 16. All other runs have similar rotation curves. In the\nfigure, we show the circular velocity Vcirc deduced from the\n2\npotential (d\u03a6/dr = Vcirc\n/r). In the range of 200\u2212800 pc,\nthere are non-circular streaming motions (see Sect. 3.2)\nwhich contribute to the derived empirical Vrot . Indeed,\nwe have calculated Vrot of the gas from the model, azimuthally averaged at a given radius, and find streaming\nmotions of amplitude similar to the observed discrepancies between the empirical RC as traced by CO and the\npredicted Vcirc 6 . Given the uncertainties, and the asymmetry of the two sides of the major axis (see Sect. 3.3), all\ntheoretical curves are compatible with the empirical ones.\nThe data points for the epicyclic frequency resonances,\nmarked by \u00d7 and + in Fig. 16, are calculated by numerically differentiating the smoothed empirical RC. These\ndata are also generally compatible with the predictions of\nthe numerical simulations.\n\n7.4. Simulation results\nSeveral runs have been carried out in order to test the\nvarious parameters, and evaluate the dependence of the\nresults on the central mass concentration and on the initial gas mass fraction. These parameters are crucial for\nthe nuclear bar decoupling. Only four of these models are\ndisplayed in Table 1.\nWe found that a high central mass concentration was\nnecessary to decouple the secondary bar, as already shown\nby Friedli & Martinet (1993). This can be understood be5\n\nAs derived from the short-spacing single-dish observations\nof Young et al. (1995), see Sect. 3.1.\n6\nAs noted in Sect. 3.3, the unfortunate coincidence of the\nPA of the bar and the disk line-of-nodes makes streaming signatures difficult to diagnose in PV and isovelocity diagrams.\n\n\f14\n\nHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\nAs seen in Fig. 17, between \u223c700 and 750 Myr the gas is\ninflowing. Moreover, the gas is always \"leading\" the stars,\nand thus is slowed down by them.\nThe Fourier analysis of the gravitational potential during the decoupling of the two bars clearly shows the development of the two modes. The Fourier analysis has been\nperformed as a function of radius, every 2 Myr, during\n100 Myr in this period. The Fourier transform of the results over the time axis gives the pattern speed as a function of radius, as shown in Fig 18, with a resolution in \u03a9p\nof 30 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . Of necessity, the temporal averaging\nmust be performed over the lifetime of the transient features; this averaging \"thickens\" the value of \u03a9p in the plot\nbecause of the time variation of the pattern speed of the\nnuclear bar.\nFig. 16. Rotation and derived frequency curves \u03a9, \u03a9\u2212\u03ba/2\nand \u03a9 + \u03ba/2 adopted for the simulations (Run A), together with the empirical curves derived from the CO(2\u2013\n1) and (1\u20130) PV diagrams. The (green) open circles trace\nthe empirical Vrot , coinciding with theoretical circular velocity Vcirc (traced by a solid line) at R = 1 kpc and at\nsmall radii. The remaining solid lines are the empirical\n(black) and theoretical (green) \u03a9 curves. The long-dashed\nline is the \u03a9\u2212\u03ba/4 curve, and the short-dashed ones are the\n\u03a9 \u00b1 \u03ba/2 ones. The corresponding data points are shown as\n\u00d7 and +; the data have been masked within 500 pc to minimize confusion. The two pattern speeds inferred from the\nsimulations are shown as horizontal dotted lines, and resonances are marked with filled circles. The vertical dashed\nlines correspond to the nuclear bar length (\u223c1 kpc) and\nthe ILR of the outer oval (\u223c1.3 kpc), also roughly equal\nto the nuclear bar's CR at \u223c1.1 kpc. The apparent mismatch of the empirical and theoretical RCs, in the range\nof 200\u2212800 pc, is due to non-circular streaming motions\n(Sect. 3.2) and asymmetry in the two sides of the rotation\ncurve (Sect. 3.3) which contribute to the inferred average\nVrot .\n\ncause the two pattern speeds are close to the precessing\nrates of the supporting orbits, which are traced by the\n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba/2 curve. A high mass concentration produces a\nmarked maximum of this curve in the center, with a large\nradial gradient favorable to the decoupling. Also, a high\ngas mass fraction of at least 5% of the total mass is required for the decoupling. The nuclear bar is even stronger\nwith a gas fraction of 10%. In Run B and D, with a scalelength of the bulge twice that of Run A and C, the mass\nconcentration was not enough to produce the decoupling\nof the nuclear bar.\nRun A, with a small bulge scalelength, and a high gas\nmass fraction, provides the best fit for NGC 2782. The\nstellar and gaseous morphologies are displayed in Fig. 17\nat three epochs, shortly after the second bar decoupling.\n\nFigure 18 lets us unambiguously isolate two bars in the\npotential, dominated by the stellar component:\n(a) The nuclear bar with \u03a9b \u223c270 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . Its corotation is at about 1.1 kpc, at a radius just slightly\nlarger than its size of 1 kpc.\n(b) The primary bar with \u03a9b \u223c 65 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 and an\nILR at \u223c1.3 kpc, roughly coincident with corotation\nof the nuclear bar; the primary bar CR is at \u223c5 kpc,\nand its UHR at \u223c3.6\u20133.8 kpc. In the gas morphology,\nthere is a (pseudo) inner ring coinciding with the UHR\nresonance (see Fig. 17).\nFrom these identifications, we can interpret the elongated nuclear ring as the ILR of the primary bar at R \u223c\n1 kpc, coinciding with the UHR/CR of the nuclear bar.\nThis ring corresponds to the H\u03b1 arc, or half-ring, encircling the NIR nuclear stellar bar. Inside the ILR ring (of\nthe primary bar), the gas morphology reveals two spiral\narms with large pitch angle, now aligned with the nuclear\nbar. These gas arms are leading with respect to the stellar\nbar, and this phase shift means that the gravity torques\nfrom the stars are negative, driving the gas inward. These\narms are winding up in a ring around the center, which\ncorresponds to the ILR of the nuclear bar. Indeed, it can\nbe seen from the frequency curves in Fig 16 that the pattern speed of the secondary bar (270 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ) crosses\nthe \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba/2 curve at about 300 pc7 . The two arms aligned\nalong the nuclear bar can be identified with the CO features, observed with the interferometer. There is also a\nhole in the center in the gas distribution, which could correspond to the ILR of the nuclear bar.\n7\n\nIndeed, the high maximum of the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba/2 curve is certainly overestimated by the epicyclic approximation, since the\norbits are very elongated. Hence, although in our simulations,\n\u03a9p of the secondary bar would indicate two ILRs, it is more\nlikely that there is only a single ILR, roughly in the middle at\n\u223c200 pc.\n\n\fHunt et al.: NUGA: IX. NGC 2782\n\n7.5. Decoupled bars: gas infall in NGC 2782\nThe previous simulations, adapted to the rotation curve of\nNGC 2782, support the scenario proposed in section 7.1. A\nprimary bar, perhaps triggered by the past interaction, has\ndriven gas toward its ILR, and while this bar was weakening, a secondary embedded bar has decoupled, prolonging\nthe gas inflow inside the ILR ring, which is now conspicuous in star formation and H\u03b1 emission. The gas has been\ndriven into two spiral arms, aligned with the nuclear bar,\nand is now winding up to the ILR of the nuclear bar, i.e.\nat about 200\u2013300 pc radius. This scenario allows a coherent interpretation of the low-velocity H\u03b1 component and\nthe entire CO morphology, as well as of our finding of\nnegative gravity torques. In NGC 2782, there seems to be\na \"smoking gun\", namely the presence of molecular gas\ninside the ILR of the primary bar, made possible by the\ndecoupling of a secondary nuclear bar from the primary\none. The gas there is certainly fueling the central starburst, at the origin of the ionized gas bubble, and in a\nsecond step should fuel directly the AGN. The timescales\nin this central region are quite short, about 6 Myr for the\ngas rotation period at 300 pc. Dynamical friction and viscous torques can then relatively quickly provide gas to fuel\nthe AGN (Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo et al. 2005, 2007), although the\npresent simulations do not have enough spatial resolution\nto simulate that realistically. Alternatively, the ILR of the\nnuclear bar suggested by our models could impede further\ngas inflow inside the resolution limit of our images.\nAccording to our simulations, there are two salient\ncharacteristics of NGC 2782 which lead to the secondary\nbar decoupling, and the ensuing negative torques. The\nfirst is its conspicuous stellar bulge, as suggested by the\nbulge-disk decomposition described in Sect. 4.1. This is\nthe biggest contributor to the central mass concentration,\nand the likely cause of the resonances that give rise to\nthe gas buildup in the rings, with the subsequent decoupling of the secondary nuclear bar. The second feature is\nthe particularly high gas mass fraction in NGC 2782. As\ndiscussed in Sect. 3.1, the mass of the molecular gas in\nNGC 2782 is the most extreme of all the NUGA galaxies\nobserved so far; within a region \u223c4 kpc in diameter, the\nmolecular gas comprises 7% of Mdyn . This centrally concentrated molecular gas could be the result of the interaction which NGC 2782 has undergone. A high gas mass\nfraction is a necessary condition for the decoupling of the\nsecondary bar, and thus promotes infall. Finally, we could\nbe observing NGC 2782 in a particularly favorable epoch\nfor the fueling of its AGN. Future work on our statistical\nsample will help understand duty cycles and timescales\nfor the creation and maintenance of active accretion in\ngalactic nuclei.\n\n8. Summary and conclusions\nWe summarize our main results as follows:\n\n15\n\n(a) High-resolution 12 CO observations of NGC 2782 obtained with the PdB interferometer show emission\naligned with the stellar nuclear bar of radius \u223c1 kpc.\nIn 12 CO(2\u20131), we clearly resolve two spiral arms at\nhigh pitch angle along the nuclear bar; in the 12 CO(1\u2013\n0) maps, the gas changes direction to form the beginning of two straight dust lanes, aligned with an outer\nstellar oval reminiscent of a primary bar.\n(b) From the stellar gravitational potential inferred from\nthe IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image and the gas density from\nthe 12 CO distributions, we compute the azimuthallyaveraged torques exerted by the stellar bars on the\ngas. This calculation reveals systematically negative\ntorques in NGC 2782, down to the resolution limit of\nour image.\n(c) The negative torques and the dynamics inferred from\nour observations are explained by a scenario which is\nconsistent with existing radio, optical, and moleculargas features in the circumnuclear region of the galaxy.\nStar formation occurs in an H\u03b1 ring-like structure encircling the nuclear bar at the ILR of the primary\nbar/oval. The gas traced by CO emission is infalling\nto the center as a result of gravity torques from the\ndecoupled nuclear bar. The two high-pitch angle CO\nspiral arms are winding up toward the center in a nuclear ring, corresponding to the ILR of the nuclear\nbar.\n(d) This scenario is supported by N-body simulations\nwhich include gas dissipation, and reproduce the secondary bar decoupling, the formation of the elongated\nring at the 1 kpc-radius ILR of the primary bar, and\nthe gas inflow to the 200-300 pc-radius ILR of the nuclear bar.\nThe average negative torques revealed by our analysis show that infall to the central regions in NGC 2782\nis occurring in the present epoch. Our numerical simulations suggest that the negative torques producing inflow\nare caused by the decoupling of the primary and nuclear\nbar. This is made possible by the high central mass concentration and large gas mass fraction in the galaxy, perhaps a result of the prior interaction which caused the\nstellar sheets, ripples, and Hi tidal tails in its outer regions. Future work will help understand what conditions\nare necessary for fueling an AGN, and how the gas distribution, its kinematics, and the stellar gravitational potential interact to set the stage for gas inflow.\nAcknowledgements.
