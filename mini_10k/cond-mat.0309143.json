D. Gujrati\nDepartment of Physics, Department of Polymer Science,\nThe University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325, USA\nNovember 20, 2018\nAbstract\nAssuming the existence of stationary metastable states (SMS's), and\nusing general thermodynamic arguments, we prove that a positive Kauzmann temperature exists for SMS's provided the ideal glass energy is\nhigher than the crystal energy at absolute zero. We confirm the general\npredictions by two exact calculations, one of which is not mean-field.\n\nGlass transition is a ubiquitous phenomenon1,2 which is believed to occur\nin a supercooled liquid (SCL), and has been investigated for at least over eight\ndecades since the earliest works of Nernst and Simon3 . Despite this, a complete\nunderstanding of the transition and related issues is still far from complete, although major progress has been made recently.4\u22127 Theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations invariably require applying (time-independent) thermodynamics\nto SCL to extract quantities like the entropy. This presumes, as we do here,\nthat there exists a stationary limit (SMS) of the metastable state (SCL) under\ninfinitely slow cooling in which the crystal is forbidden from nucleating.8 We\nfurther assume that SCL can be defined all the way down to absolute zero,\nwhich may not be the case always.7\nWe focus on the partition function (PF) determined by the configurational,\ni.e., the potential energy and the related entropy in this work due the central importance of the configurational entropy, a classical statistical mechanics\n(CSM) concept,9 for the ideal glass transition.1,2 Experimentally, the SCL configurational entropy exhibits a rapid drop near a temperature \u2243 two-thirds of\nthe melting temperature TM ,1,2 and its smooth low-temperature extrapolation\ngives rise to a negative entropy (the entropy crisis commonly known as the\nKauzmann paradox)1 below a non-zero Kauzmann temperature TK . There are\nseveral computational5 and theoretical6,7,10 results clearly demonstrating the existence of the entropy crisis. A positive TK is also conceptually necessary for the\nobserved Vogel-Fulcher behavior in fragile systems. However, the situation has\nbecome very confusing, as there have appeared several recent arguments11\u221213\n1\n\n\fagainst its existence. It is, therefore, extremely important to clarify the issue, which we do by proving in two different ways the existence of a non-zero\nTK using general but rigorous thermodynamic arguments, valid for classical or\nquantum systems. The proof assumes SMS- existence, so that thermodynamics\ncan be applied. Its stationary nature allows us to investigate SMS using the PF\nformalism in (1) below. We verify our conclusions by two exact calculations,\none of which is not a mean-field calculation.\nConsider a system composed of N particles for which E, V and S, which are\nhomogeneous functions of order 1 in N , denote the energy, the volume, and the\nentropy. The canonical PF for fixed V and N is given by\nZ \u2261 T rW (E) exp(\u2212\u03b2E),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T r stands for summation over the energy (eigenvalues) E \u2265 E0 up to\nits maximum, \u03b2 \u2261 1/T, T being the system temperature in the units of the\nBoltzmann constant kB , and W (E) = exp(S) \u2265 1 is defined suiatbly to represent the number of distinct microstates for a given E. The lowest allowed\nenergy E0 [W (E0 ) 6= 0] certainly represents the Helmholtz free energy and the\nenergy of the perfect crystal (CR) at T = 0. In equilibrium, Z must be maximized in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e, keeping E/N, V /N fixed. The\nentropy9 S(E) \u2261 ln W (E) must be non-negative so that the state is observable\nin Nature.14 This observability condition on S cannot be violated, even for a\nSMS if it is observable. Therefore, its violation (SSMS (T ) < 0 for T < TK > 0)14\nimplies that SMS cannot exist in Nature when the violation occurs, in which\ncase the SMS associated with the SCL must be replaced by a new state, commonly known as the ideal glass state below TK , whose energy at T \u2264 TK > 0\nis EK > E0 .1,2 The transition between the two states is called the ideal glass\ntransition.\nThe order parameter \u03c1 (see also below) is traditionally used to distinguish\nvarious phases of the system, with \u03c1 = 0 representing the disordered phase,\nthe equilibrium liquid (EL), containing the number of microstates Wdis consistent with \u03c1 = 0. The ordered phase CR has \u03c1 6= 0, and contains the number of microstates Word consistent with \u03c1 6= 0. We partition W (B) using \u03c1 :\nW (B) \u2261 Word (B) + Wdis (B). (Presence of other configurations will not affect\nour argument.) We introduce corresponding PF Z\u03b1 (\u03b1 = dis or ord) following\n(1) with W replaced by W\u03b1 . Above TM , Zdis >Zord , and below TM , Zdis <Zord\n. The PF along with the its maximization requirement allows us to describe\nCR and EL collectively. We describe SMS as the continuation of Zdis below\nTM by abandoning this requirement. This necessarily yields \u03c1 = 0 also for\nSCL. While W\u03b1 (E) \u2265 1 for physically observed states, there is no reason for it\nto hold everywhere for SMS states obtained by the above continuation; states\nwith W\u03b1 (E) < 1 are not realizable.14 Nevertheless, as long as W\u03b1 (E) \u2265 0, Z\u03b1\nis a sum of positive terms, so that \u03a9\u03b1 \u2261 ln Z\u03b1 (i) satisfies proper convexity\nproperties14 ,and (ii) is dominated by the maximum value of S\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2E in Z\u03b1 .\nExpressing\n(2)\nZ\u03b1 = W\u03b1 (E0 )e\u2212\u03b2E0 (1 + Z \u03b1 ),\n\n2\n\n\f\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere Z \u03b1 \u2261 T r [W\u03b1 (E)/W\u03b1 (E0 )]e\u2212\u03b2(E\u2212E0 ) , with T r restricted to all E > E0 ,\nwe find that T \u03a9\u03b1 = T S\u03b1 (E0 ) \u2212 E0 + T ln(1 + Z \u03b1 ). For all finite N , Z \u03b1 \u2192 0\nas T \u2192 0, provided W\u03b1 (E0 ) > 0. The last condition means that T S\u03b1 \u2192 0\nas T \u2192 0; hence, F\u03b1 \u2261 \u2212T \u03a9\u03b1 \u2192 E0 for CR and SMS at T = 0 : Both have\nidentical free energies at absolute zero, so that F\u03b1 /E0 \u2261 1. Now, we can take the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e without altering the conclusion F\u03b1 /E0 \u2261 1. However, it is known\nexperimentally that (1) the heat capacity of the glassy state can be substantially\ndifferent from that of the corresponding crystal at the same temperature,15 and\n(2) the energy of this state EK extrapolated to absolute zero is higher than that\nof the CR energy E0 .1,2 Consequently, the stationary limit of the glassy state is\ndifferent not only from the CR, but also from the SMS near absolute zero. Since\nSMS has a positve heat capacity, it achieves its energy EK > E0 at a positive\ntemperature TK , where it merges with the ideal glass. This is our first rigorous\nproof that an ideal glass transition must occur at a positive temperature if we\nidentify the stationary limit of the glassy state with the ideal glass noted above.\nWe now proceed to give an alternative rigorous proof independent of F\u03b1 /E0 \u2261\n1 at T = 0 derived in the canonical ensemble. We consider the microcanonical\nensemble in which the entropy functions S\u03b1 for fixed V ,N , are shown schematically as functions of E by OAB for the CR (OA) and its SMS extension (AB) for\nthe superheated CR, and DACK for the EL (DA), and its SCL extension (ACK)\nin Fig. 1. The corresponding Helmholtz free energies F\u03b1 vs T in the canonical\nensemble are shown schematically by BO and DACK in the inset. Since a SMS\nis not an equilibrium state, its entropy at some E cannot exceed the entropy\nof the corresponding equilibrium state at the same E. This explains the form\nof the entropy in Fig. 1, which is also supported by all known observations,1,2\nexact6,7,10b and numerical calculations,5 and from the arguments and the calculations presented below. We also show the entropy function for a non-stationary\nmetastable state by GF in Fig. 1, assuming that crystallization is forbidden.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nThe slope of HH gives 1/TM and of OO' gives the inverse temperature (see O\nin the inset) where FSMS = E0 .\nSince S, S\u03b1 and E are homogeneous functions of order 1 in N, (\u2202S/\u2202E)N,V\nand its analogue (\u2202S\u03b1 /\u2202E)N,V are homogeneous functions of order 0 in N so\nthat\n1/(\u2202S/\u2202E)N,V = T + O(1/N ), 1/(\u2202S\u03b1 /\u2202E)N,V = T\u03b1 + O(1/N ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T ,T\u03b1 represent the temperatures corresponding to S,S\u03b1 , respectively, as\nN \u2192 \u221e. The behavior in (3) is critical in understanding the entropy function\nslope at K, the Kauzmann point [SSMS = 0]. There are two distinct possibilities.\nThe slope at K is either finite, as shown explicitly in Fig. 1 and consistent with\nour rigorous analysis, or infinite. The former corresponds to a positive TK ,\nwhile the latter corresponds to an absence of a Kauzmann paradox. Almost all\nexplicit calculations show the former as the usual behavior, two of which are\npresented below.\nWe focus on the behavior of the growth function,16 which is adapted here\nwith a slight modification. We divide the almost continuum energy spectrum\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Schematic form of the generic entropy functions for various possible\nstates.\n\n4\n\n\fE into bins, each of width \u2206\u01eb > 0, and index the bins by an integer j, with\nj = 0 for the lowest energy bin, which contains all energies between E0 and\nE0 + \u2206\u01eb. We may take for \u2206\u01eb the average energy difference between any two\nconsecutive energy levels of a single particle spectrum corresponding to its bound\nstate; its actual choice is not important for our discussion. Let W (B) denote\nthe number of distinct configurations corresponding to energies lying in the bin\nwith index B. The growth function16 \u03bc(B) for fixed N, V is given by \u03bc(B) \u2261\nW (B +1)/W (B), and represents on an average the number of new configuration\neach older configuration generates as we add a quantum of energy to the system.\nIt is easy to see that \u03bc(B) is a homogeneous function of order 0 in N . Taking\nthe logarithm on both sides and expanding S(B + 1) about B for finite N , we\nimmediately recognize that\nln \u03bc(B) = (\u2202S/\u2202B) + O(1/N ) = \u2206\u01eb/T + O(1/N ) \u2265 0\n\n(4)\n\nfor non-negative T, where we have used (3). We immediately note that not only\n\u03bc(B) \u2265 1, but also that it is monotone decreasing function of B. It achieves\nits maximum value \u03bc(B) \u2192 \u221e at T =0, see point O in Fig. 1, and becomes\nfinite as soon as T is raised above zero, decreasing monotonically to 1 at infinite\ntemperatures. We similarly introduce the growth functions \u03bc\u03b1 using W\u03b1 , which\nsatisfy Eq. (4) except that T is replaced by T\u03b1 . To proceed further, we write\nW (B) \u2261 Word (B)[1 + Xdis (B)/Xord (B)], where X\u03b1 \u2261 W\u03b1 /W (0 \u2264 X\u03b1 \u2264 1). It\nis easy to see that\nln \u03bc \u2261 ln \u03bcord + ln[1 + Xdis (\u03bcdis /\u03bcord \u2212 1)].\n\n(5)\n\nWe emphasize that ln \u03bc and ln \u03bc\u03b1 take their limiting values \u2206\u01eb/T, and \u2206\u01eb/T\u03b1 ,\nrespectively, as N \u2192 \u221e; however, even for finite but large N , they are not\nfar from their limits as they are homogeneous functions of order 0. For finite\nN , Xdis is strictly non-zero but vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e. Let us apply (5) at\nB = BK , which corresponds to the bin containing E = EK > E0 . Since CR is\nthe equilibrium state at EK , we have, for N \u2192 \u221e, ln \u03bc \u2261 ln \u03bcord = \u2206\u01eb/Tord ,\nthe CR growth function (at EK ), which must be finite since EK corresponds to\na non-zero CR temperature. The effect of \u03bcdis is noticed only for finite N as we\ndiscuss below. For finite N , ln \u03bc must be close to \u2206\u01eb/Tord . This immediately\nimplies that \u03bcdis cannot diverge at EK . It must be finite, and must remain finite\neven as N \u2192 \u221e. For this to be so, it is clear that Tdis \u2261 TK cannot be zero\nat EK . Thus, as long as EK > E0 , \u03bcdis must remain finite as N \u2192 \u221e, and\nthere must exist a positive Kauzmann temperature TK . This constitutes the\nsecond rigorous proof of our central result. In CSM, S represents the classical\nconfigurational entropy.9 In QSM, S represents the total entropy.9 Thus, TK\ncorresponds to vanishing of different entropies in the two cases. Any attempt to\nestimate the classical configurational entropy in QSM, where it has no meaning,\nwill require some sort of approximation, which we do not consider here as we\nare interested in rigorous results. Therefore, we will not pursue this point further.\n\n5\n\n\fSince the minimum energy state E = EK in SMS corresponds to a positive\ntemperature, the SMS state cannot exist below it. Hence, an ideal glass transition must be invoked at this Kauzmann point (T = TK ). The discussion also\nestablishes that the Kauzmann point in the disordered phase exists only when\nthere exists another equilibrium state; otherwise, there will be no partitioning\nand, therefore, there will be no Kauzmann point; see also the explicit calculation\nbelow.\nWe consider two CSM models in which we obtain positive Kauzmann temperature. The calculations are carried out exactly\n1. One-dimensional Polymer Model. The example also shows how \u03c1 is\nused to distinguish different phases. Consider m-component spins Si located\nat site i of a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary condition (SN +1\n=S1 ). Each spin can point along or against the\n\u221a axes (labeled 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m)\nof an m-dimensional spin space and is of length m. The spins interact via a\nferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction of strength (\u2212J), with K \u2261 J/T >\n0. The high-temperature expansion of the PF is\nX\nZN (K, m) =\nK B mL ,\n(6)\nwhere m \u2265 0 can be taken as a real number, and describes polymers with\nmultiple bonds and loops, with K, and m denoting the bond and the loop\nactivity, respectively.17 The transfer matrix exp(KS * S\u2032 ) has eigenvalues [x \u2261\nexp(Km)]\n\u03bb1 = x + 1/x + 2(m \u2212 1), \u03bb2 = x \u2212 1/x, \u03bb3 = x + 1/x \u2212 2,\n\n(7)\n\nthat are 1-fold, m-fold, and (m \u2212 1)-fold, respectively.18 The eigenvalue \u03bb1 is\ndominant atP\nhigh temperatures\nand describes the disordered phase. Its eigenvec\u221a\ntor h\u03bedis | = i hi| / 2m, where h2k| ( h2k + 1|) denotes the spin state pointing\nalong the positive (negative) k-th spin-axis, has the correct symmetry to give\nzero magnetization (\u03c1 = 0). For m < 1, \u03bb2 becomes dominant at low temperatures [x \u2265 xc = 1/(1 \u2212 m)] and describes the ordered phase, with a phase\ntransition\nat xc . The corresponding m eigenvectors are given by the combination\nD\n\u221a\n(k)\n\u03beord = [h2k| \u2212 h2k + 1|]/ 2, which are orthogonal to h\u03bedis | . These eigenvectors have the symmetry to ensure \u03c1 6= 0. We note that both eigenvalues give\nthe same free energy again at absolute zero. This means that if the eigenvalue\n\u03bb1 is taken to represent the metastable phase above xc , its free energy must\nbecome equal to that of the equilibrium phase (given by \u03bb2 ) at absolute zero, in\nconformity with the proof given above. The bond and the loop densities \u03c6B \u2261\n\u2202 ln \u03bb1 /\u2202 ln K, and \u03c6L \u2261 \u2202 ln \u03bb1 /\u2202 ln m are used to calculate the entropy per\nsite s = ln \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03c6B ln K\u2212 \u03c6L ln m. The proper convexity requirements (\u2202\u03c6B /\n\u2202 ln K \u2265 0, \u2202\u03c6L / \u2202 ln m \u2265 0) for (6) are always satisfied for \u03bb1 ; see, for example,\nthe behavior of \u03c6B in Fig. 2, where we have taken m = 0.7. As the hightemperature disordered phase represents a physical system, it cannot give rise\nto a negative entropy; however, its metastable extension violates it as shown in\nFig. 2, where its entropy becomes negative below TK \u223c\n= 0.266, which is lower\n6\n\n\fthan the transition temperature Tc . As m \u2192 0, both TK and Tc (TK < Tc ) move\ndown to zero simultaneously, and there is no Kauzmann point since there is no\nordered state any more, as argued above. Thus, our exact calculation confirms\nour results.\nIt should be noted that the eigenvalues \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are independent of the size\nof the lattice. Therefore, they can be used to describe not only the disordered\nand ordered phases, but also the SMS, which is the continuation of the disordered phase, even for a finite N . Thermodynamic limit is not necessary. For\nfinite N , Z (\u03b1) (K, m) < Z(K, m) and the inequality becomes an equality only\nas N \u2192 \u221e for the proper choice of \u03b1 depending on the temperature.\n2. Binary Mixture Model. We now consider an anti-ferromagnetic Ising\nmodel (J > 0) in zero magnetic field on a Husimi cactus, which can be solved\nexactly.19 The cactus can be thought as an approximation of a square lattice,\nso that the exact Husimi cactus solution can be thought of as an approximate\nsolution of the square lattice model. The two spin states represent the particles\nof two species. There is a sublattice structure at low temperatures caused by\nthe anti-ferromagnetic interaction: particles of one species are found on one of\nthe two sublattices. We identify this ordered structure as a crystal. We allow\ntwo-, and three-spin (J \u2032 6= 0) interactions within the same square; the latter\nensures that the melting transition is first order. The interaction energy is\nX\nX\nE =J\nSS \u2032 + J \u2032\nSS \u2032 S \u2032\u2032 .\n(8)\nThe first sum is over nearest-neighbor spin pairs and the second over neighboring\nspin triplets within each square. We set J=1 to set the temperature scale. The\nmodel is solved recursively, as has been described elsewhere.19 We introduce\npartial PFs Zm (\u2191 or \u2193) depending on the states of the spin at the m-th cactus\nlevel. It represents the contribution of the part of the cactus above that level to\nthe total PF. We then introduce the ratio xm \u2261 Zm (\u2191)/[Zm (\u2191) + Zm (\u2193)],which\nsatisfies the recursion relation\nxm \u2261 f (xm+1 , xm+2 , v)/[f (xm+1 , xm+2 , v) + f (ym+1 , ym+2 , 1/v)], where\nf (x, x\u2032 , v) \u2261 x2 x\u2032 /u4 v 4 + 2xx\u2032 yv 2 + x2 yv 2 + u4 x\u2032 y 2 + 2xyy \u2032 + y 2 y \u2032 /v 2 with\n\u2032\nu \u2261 e\u03b2 , v \u2261 e\u03b2J , y \u2261 1 \u2212 x and y \u2032 \u2261 1 \u2212 x\u2032 . There are two kinds of fix-point\nsolutions of the recursion relation, which describe the bulk behavior.19\nIn the 1-cycle solution, xm = 1/2 is the same at all levels and exists at\nall temperatures. This solution corresponds to the disordered paramagnetic\nphase at high temperatures and the SMS below the melting transition. In the\n2-cycle solution, xm alternates between two consecutive sites. This solution\ncorresponds to the low temperature AF-ordered phase, which represents the\nCR at half occupation. For J \u2032 = 0.01, we find that TM \u223c\n= 2.753, where there is\na discontinuity in the entropy per site of 0.0168. The SMS below TM represents\nSCL, whose entropy density, see Fig. 2 vanishes at TK \u223c\n= 1.132, and whose\nspecific heat (not shown) remains positive with a maximum at T \u223c\n= 1.26. At\nabsolute zero, the entropy per site SSCL \u2243 \u22120.3466. The CR and SCL free\nenergies per site become identical (= 2J) at absolute zero in accordance with\nthe claim above. Thus, the free energy diagram we obtain in this case is similar\n7\n\n\fFigure 2: The bond and the entropy densities. Both models show an entropy\ncrisis at a positive temperature.\n\n8\n\n\fto that in Fig. 1.\nNote that the one-dimensional exact calculation is not a mean-field type\ncalculation. Hence, our results are not of mean-field nature. We also note that\nthere is no frustration in the Ising model, which shows the ideal glass transition.\nBoth calculations confirm the general predictions. In particular, we conclude\nthat if SMS exists, it gives rise to a positive Kauzmann temperature provided\nthe ideal glass energy EK > E0 , the ideal CR energy.\n\nReferences\n1. W. Kauzmann, Chem.

In general, the total PF can be reduced to a product of different PF's\ncorresponding to independent degrees of freedom (DOF's). Collisions between particles, which are not included in the PF, or weak quantum effects\nbring about a common temperature between these DOF's; otherwise their\ntemperatures need not be the same. The factorization implies that the\nentropy contribution due to each DOF must not only be additive, but also\nnon-negative individually to avoid the entropy crisis. We only consider\nthe irreduible PF in (1) containig the interaction energy in the rest of the\npaper. In quantum statistical mechanics (QSM) for a system at rest, the\ntotal Hamiltonian including the kinetic energy operator determines the\nPF in (1); thus, S represents the total entropy Stot including the kinetic\nenergy contribution. In classical statistical mechanics (CSM), the translational and configurational PF's with corresponding entropies SKE and\nS, respectively, are completely decoupled, with (1) describing the latter\nPF. In this case, S is the classical configurational entropy and the total\n9\n\n\fentropy is Stot = S + SKE . Although it is not the convention, S in QSM\nwill be called the quantum configurational entropy.\n10. (a) J. H. Gibbs, and E. A. DiMarzio, J. Chem. Phys. 28, 373 (1958). (b)\nB. Derrida, Phys. Rev.

Thus, it is possible for the SMS to have a negative\nentropy over some temperature range. This will only means that such\nstates are not observable in Nature.\n15. P. D. Gujrati and M. Goldstein, J.
