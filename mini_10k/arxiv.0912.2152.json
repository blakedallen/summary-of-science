We study the structure of Stanley\u2013Reisner rings associated\nto cyclic polytopes, using ideas from unprojection theory. Consider\nthe boundary simplicial complex \u2206(d, m) of the d-dimensional cyclic\npolytope with m vertices.

As an application, we use the Kustin\u2013Miller complex\nconstruction to identify the minimal graded free resolutions of these\nrings. In particular, we recover results of Schenzel, Terai and Hibi about\ntheir graded Betti numbers.\n\n1. Introduction\nGorenstein commutative rings form an important class of commutative\nrings. For example, they appear in algebraic geometry as canonical rings\nof regular surfaces and anticanonical rings of Fano n-folds and in algebraic\ncombinatorics as Stanley\u2013Reisner rings of sphere triangulations. In codimensions 1 and 2 they are complete intersections and in codimension 3 they\nare Pfaffians [2], but, to our knowledge, no structure theorems are known\nfor higher codimensions.\nUnprojection theory [11], which analyzes and constructs complicated commutative rings in terms of simpler ones, began with the aim of partly filling\nthis gap. The first kind of unprojection which appeared in the literature is\nthat of type Kustin\u2013Miller, studied originally by Kustin and Miller [8] and\nlater by Reid and the second author [9, 10]. Starting from a codimension\n1 ideal J of a Gorenstein ring R such that the quotient R/J is Gorenstein,\nKustin\u2013Miller unprojection uses the information contained in HomR (J, R) to\nconstruct a new Gorenstein ring S which is birational to R and corresponds\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

See Subsection 2.2 for a precise definition of Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection and the introduction of [3] for references\nto applications.\nIn the paper [3], the authors proved that on the algebraic level of Stanley\u2013\nReisner rings, stellar subdivisions of Gorenstein* simplicial complexes correspond to Kustin\u2013Miller unprojections and gave applications to StanleyReisner rings associated to stacked polytopes. In the present paper, we use\nunprojection theory to study the structure of Stanley\u2013Reisner rings associated to cyclic polytopes. This setting is different from the one studied in [3]\nsince here, except for some easy subcases, stellar subdivisions do not appear\nand the unprojection ideals are more complicated.\nOur main result, which is stated precisely in Theorems 3.3 and 4.4, can\nbe described as follows. Assume d \u2265 4 and d + 1 < m. Consider the cyclic\npolytope which has m vertices and dimension d, and denote by \u2206(d, m) its\nboundary simplicial complex. We show how to express the Stanley-Reisner\nring of \u2206(d, m + 1) in terms of the Stanley\u2013Reisner rings of \u2206(d, m) and\n\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1) via Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection. Moreover, a similar result is\nalso true for the remaining cases d = 2, 3 and m = d+ 1, see Subsections 3.1,\n3.2, 4.1 and 4.2. In Section 5 we give a combinatorial interpretation of our\nconstruction.\nAs an application, in Section 6 we inductively identify the minimal graded\nfree resolutions of the Stanley\u2013Reisner rings k[\u2206(d, m)]. We use this identification in Proposition 6.6 to calculate the graded Betti numbers of these\nrings, recovering results originally due to Schenzel [12] for d even and Terai\nand Hibi [13] for d odd. Our derivation is more algebraic than the one in\n[13], and does not use Hochster's formula or Alexander duality. Finally,\nSubsection 6.2 contains examples and a link to related computer algebra\ncode.\nAn interesting open question is whether there are other families of Gorenstein Stanley\u2013Reisner rings related by unprojections in a similar way as\ncyclic polytopes, compare also the discussion in [3, Section 6].\n2. Preliminaries\nAssume k is a field, and m a positive integer. An (abstract) simplicial complex on the vertex set {1, . . . , m} is a collection \u2206 of subsets of\n{1, . . . , m} such that (i) all singletons {i} with i \u2208 {1, . . . , m} belong to \u2206\nand (ii) \u03c3 \u2282 \u03c4 \u2208 \u2206 implies \u03c3 \u2208 \u2206. The elements of \u2206 are called faces and\nthose maximal with respect to inclusion are called facets. The dimension of\na face \u03c3 is defined as one less than the cardinality of \u03c3. The dimension of\n\u2206 is the maximum dimension of a face. Any abstract simplicial complex \u2206\nhas a geometric realization, which is unique up to linear homeomorphism.\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n3\n\nFor any subset W of {1, . . . , m}, we denote by xW the square-free monomial in the polynomial ring k[x1 , . . . , xm ] with support W , in other words\nxW is the product of xt for t \u2208 W . The ideal I\u2206 of k[x1 , . . . , xm ] which\nis generated by the square-free monomials xW with W \u2208\n/ \u2206 is called the\nStanley-Reisner ideal of \u2206. The face ring, or Stanley-Reisner ring, of \u2206\nover k, denoted k[\u2206], is defined as the quotient ring of k[x1 , . . . , xm ] by the\nideal I\u2206 .\nAssume R = k[x1 , . . . , xm ] is a polynomial ring over a field k with the\ndegrees of all variables xi positive, and denote by m = (x1 , . . . , xm ) the\nmaximal homogeneous ideal of R. Assume M is a finitely generated graded\nR-module. Denote by\n0 \u2192 Fg \u2192 Fg\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 F1 \u2192 F0 \u2192 M \u2192 0\nthe minimal graded free resolution of M as R-module, and write\nFi = \u2295j R(\u2212j)bij .\nThe integer bij is called the ij-th graded Betti number of M and is also\nP\ndenoted by bij (M ). For fixed i we set bi (M ) =\nj bij (M ). The integer\nbi (M ) is the rank of the free R-module Fi in the category of (ungraded)\nR-modules, and\n(2.1)\n\nbi (M ) = dimR/m TorR\ni (R/m, M ),\n\ncf. [7, Proposition 1.7]. For more details about free resolutions and Betti\nnumbers see, for example, [6, Sections 19, 20].\nAssume R is a ring. An element r \u2208 R will be called R-regular if the\nmultiplication by r map R \u2192 R, u 7\u2192 ru is injective. A sequence r1 , . . . , rn\nof elements of R will be called a regular R-sequence if r1 is R-regular, and,\nfor 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we have that ri is R/(r1 , . . . , ri\u22121 )-regular.\nAssume k is a field, and a, m, n three positive integers with m < n and\n2a \u2264 n \u2212 m + 2. We define the ideal Ia,m,n \u2282 k[xm , xm+1 , . . . , xn ] by\nIa,m,n = (xt1 xt2 . . . xta m \u2264 t1 , ta \u2264 n, tj + 2 \u2264 tj+1 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 a \u2212 1).\nThe assumption 2a \u2264 n \u2212 m + 2 implies that there exists at least one\nmonomial generator of Ia,m,n , namely xm xm+2 . . . xm+2(a\u22121) . For example,\nwe have I2,3,6 = (x3 x5 , x3 x6 , x4 x6 ).\n2.1. Cyclic polytopes. Recall from [1, Section 5.2] the definition of cyclic\npolytopes. We fix two integers m, d, with 2 \u2264 d < m, and define the cyclic\npolytope Cd (m) \u2282 Rd as follows: Fix, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, ti \u2208 R with t1 <\nt2 < * * * < tm . By definition, the cyclic polytope Cd (m) = Cd (t1 , . . . , tm )\nis the convex hull in Rd of the subset {f (t1 ), f (t2 ), . . . , f (tm )} \u2282 Rd , where\n\n\f4\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nf : R \u2192 Rd with f (t) = (t, t2 , . . . , td ) for t \u2208 R. We have that Cd (m) is a simplicial d-polytope, which up to combinatorial equivalence does not depend\non the choice of the points ti . We denote by \u2206(d, m) the boundary simplicial\ncomplex of Cd (m), by definition \u2206(d, m) has as elements the empty set and\nthe sets of vertices of the proper faces of Cd (m), cf. [1, Corollary 5.2.7].\nAssume W \u2282 {1, . . . , m} is a proper nonempty subset. A nonempty subset\nX \u2282 W is called contiguous if there exist i, j with 2 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 m\u22121 such that\ni\u22121\u2208\n/ W, j + 1 \u2208\n/ W , X = {i, i + 1, . . . , j}. A contiguous X \u2282 W is called\nodd contiguous if #X is odd. Assume W contains a contiguous subset,\nthis is equivalent to the existence of a \u2208 W and b1 , b2 \u2208 {1, . . . , m} \\ W\nwith b1 < a < b2 . Then, there exist a unique integer t \u2265 1 and a unique\ndecomposition\nW = Y1 \u222a X1 \u222a X2 \u222a * * * \u222a Xt \u222a Y2 ,\nsuch that Y1 is either empty or of the form {1, 2, . . . , i} for some i \u2265 1 with\ni+1 \u2208\n/ W , Y2 is either empty or of the form {j, j + 1, . . . , m} for some j \u2264 m\nwith j \u2212 1 \u2208\n/ W , each Xp , for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 t, is a contiguous subset of W , and\nfor p1 < p2 each element of Xp1 is strictly smaller than any element of Xp2 .\nFor a real number r we denote by [r] the integral value of r, i.e., the\nlargest integer which is smaller or equal than r. The following theorem\ncharacterizing the faces of \u2206(d, m) is proven in [1, Theorem 5.2.13], compare\nalso [13, Lemma 2.2].\nTheorem 2.1. Assume W \u2282 {1, . . . , m} is a nonempty subset with #W \u2264\nd. W is a face of \u2206(d, m) if and only if the number of odd contiguous subsets\nof W is at most d \u2212 #W . In particular, if #W \u2264 [d/2] then W is a face of\n\u2206(d, m).\n2.2. Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection. We recall the definition of Kustin\u2013\nMiller unprojection from [10]. Assume R is a local (or graded) Gorenstein ring, and J \u2282 R a codimension 1 ideal with R/J Gorenstein. Fix\n\u03c6 \u2208 HomR (J, R) such that HomR (J, R) is generated as an R-module by the\nsubset {i, \u03c6}, where i denotes the inclusion morphism. The Kustin\u2013Miller\nunprojection ring S of the pair J \u2282 R is the quotient ring\nR[T ]\n,\nS=\n(T u \u2212 \u03c6(u) u \u2208 J)\nwhere T is a new variable. The ring S is, up to isomorphism, independent\nof the choice of \u03c6. The original definition of Kustin and Miller [8] was using\nprojective resolutions, compare Subsection 2.3 below.\n2.3. The Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction. The following construction, which is due to Kustin and Miller [8], will be important in Section 6,\nwhere we identify the minimal graded free resolution of k[\u2206(d, m)].\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n5\n\nAssume R is a polynomial ring over a field with the degrees of all variables\npositive, and I \u2282 J \u2282 R are two homogeneous ideals of R such that both\nquotient rings R/I and R/J are Gorenstein and dim R/J = dim R/I \u2212 1.\nWe define k1 , k2 \u2208 Z such that \u03c9R/I = R/I(k1 ) and \u03c9R/J = R/J(k2 ), compare [1, Proposition 3.6.11], and assume that k1 > k2 . We fix a graded homomorphism \u03c6 \u2208 HomR/I (J, R/I) of degree k1 \u2212 k2 such that HomR/I (J, R/I)\nis generated as an R/I-module by the subset {i, \u03c6}, where i denotes the inclusion morphism, compare Subsection 2.2.

We denote the\nrank of the free R-module A1 by t1 , since CJ is self-dual t1 is also the rank\nof the free R-module Ag\u22121 . We fix R-module bases e1 , . . . , et1 of A1 and\n\u00ea1 , . . . , \u00eat1 of Ag\u22121 .

For an\nR-basis f1 , . . . ft of A we denote by f1\u2217 , . . . , ft\u2217 the basis of A\u2217 dual to it.\n\n\f6\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\n\u2217\nthe R-homomorphism with \u03b1\u0303dg\u22121 (\u00ea\u2217i ) =\nDenote by \u03b1\u0303dg\u22121 : A\u2217g\u22121 \u2192 R = Bg\u22121\n\u02c6li 1R for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t1 .

We denote by \u03b1\u0303 : CI \u2192 CJ\nthe chain map dual to \u03b1\u0303d . The map \u03b1\u03030 : B0 = R \u2192 R = A0 is multiplication\nby an invertible element, say w, of R, cf.

However, in the cases of stacked and cyclic polytopes it is minimal, see [3] and\nTheorem 6.1. In the following we will call CS the Kustin\u2013Miller complex\nconstruction. We refer the reader to Subsection 6.2 for explicit examples of\nthis construction.\n3. The main theorem for d even\nWe fix a field k, and assume that d, m are integers with d even and\n2 \u2264 d < m \u2212 1. (The case m = d + 1 is discussed in Subsection 3.2.) We\nset a = (d + 2)/2, and denote by k[\u2206(d, m)] the Stanley-Reisner ring of the\nsimplicial complex \u2206(d, m).\nThe following lemma is an almost immediate consequence of Theorem 2.1.\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n7\n\nLemma 3.1. We have\nk[\u2206(d, m)] \u223c\n= k[x1 , . . . , xm ]/(Ia,1,m\u22121 , Ia,2,m ).\nProof. Denote by A the set of minimal monomial generators of the ideal\n(Ia,1,m\u22121 , Ia,2,m ). We first show that if xV \u2208 A, then V is not a face of\n\u2206(d, m). Assume xV is a monomial generator of Ia,1,m\u22121 , the case xV is a\nmonomial generator of Ia,2,m follows by the same arguments. Since #V = a,\nwe have that the number of odd contiguous subsets of V is at least a \u2212 1.\nSince a \u2212 1 = d/2 > d/2 \u2212 1 = d \u2212 a, by Theorem 2.1 V is not a face of\n\u2206(d, m).\nAssume now W \u2282 {1, . . . , m} is a subset with #W \u2264 d. We will show\nthat if W is not a face of \u2206(d, m) then there exists a monomial generator\nxV \u2208 A with V \u2282 W . By Theorem 2.1 #W \u2265 a. We will argue by induction\non the cardinality of W .\nDenote by p the number of the odd contiguous subsets of W considered\nas a subset of {1, . . . , m}, and, for w \u2208 W , by pw the number of the odd\ncontiguous subsets of W \\ {w} also considered as a subset of {1, . . . , m}. By\nTheorem 2.1 p > d \u2212 #W . If #W = a, then p > d \u2212 #W implies that W\nhas at least d \u2212 a + 1 = a \u2212 1 = #W \u2212 1 odd contiguous subsets, and we set\nV = W.\nAssume for the rest of the proof that #W > a. By the inductive hypothesis it is enough to show that there exists w \u2208 W such that W \\ {w} is not\na face of \u2206(d, m). Hence, by Theorem 2.1 it is enough to show that there\nexists w \u2208 W with pw > d \u2212 #W + 1.\nWe call a nonempty X \u2282 W a gc-subset if there exist i \u2264 j with i\u22121 \u2208\n/ W,\nj+1 \u2208\n/ W such that X = {i, i + 1, . . . , j}. It is obvious that a contiguous\nsubset of W is a gc-subset, and that a gc-subset of W is contiguous if and\nonly if contains neither 1 nor m.\nIf W contains a gc-subset of even cardinality, say {i, i + 1, . . . , j} we set\nw = m if j = m, while if j 6= m we set w = i. In the first case, since i = 1\ncontradicts #W \u2264 d, we have that pw = p + 1, so pw > d \u2212 #W + 1 follows.\nSimilarly, for the second case again pw = p + 1 and pw > d \u2212 #W + 1 follows.\nAssume for the rest of proof that all gc-subsets of W are of odd cardinality.\nFirst assume that W contains a gc-subset {i, i + 1, . . . , j} of odd cardinality\nat least 3, and set w = i + 1. Since (i, j) = (1, m) is impossible by #W \u2264 d,\nit is clear that pw = p + 1, so again pw > d \u2212 #W + 1.\nSo we can assume for the rest of the proof that all gc-subsets of W are of\ncardinality 1. We either set w = m if m \u2208 W , or if m \u2208\n/ W we set w to be\nthe smallest element of W . If m \u2208 W and 1 \u2208 W we have pw = p = #W \u2212 2,\nand p > d \u2212 #W implies 2#W \u2212 2 > d, so since d is even 2#W > d + 3,\nhence pw > d \u2212 #W + 1. If m \u2208 W and 1 \u2208\n/ W , we have pw = p = #W \u2212 1,\n\n\f8\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nand pw > d \u2212 #W + 1 is equivalent to 2#W > d + 2, which is true by the\nassumption #W > a = (d + 2)/2. If m \u2208\n/ W and 1 \u2208 W the argument is\nexactly symmetric to the case m \u2208 W and 1 \u2208\n/ W . If m \u2208\n/ W and 1 \u2208\n/ W,\nwe have pw = p \u2212 1 = #W \u2212 1 and pw > d \u2212 #W + 1 is equivalent to\n2#W > d + 2, which is true by the assumption #W > a = (d + 2)/2. This\nfinishes the proof of Lemma 3.1.\n\u0003\nWe now further assume that d is an even integer with d \u2265 4, the case\nd = 2 is discussed in Subsection 3.1. We set R = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z], where we\nput degree 1 for all variables. We consider the ideals I = (Ia,1,m\u22121 , Ia,2,m )\nand J = (Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 , zIa\u22122,3,m\u22122 ) of R. (When we need to be more precise\nwe will also use the notations Id,m for I and Jd,m for J.) It is clear that I \u2282\n(Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 ), hence I \u2282 J. Moreover, using Lemma 3.1, R/I \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m)][z]\n\u223c\nand R/J = k[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)][x1 , xm ]. Consequently, both rings R/I and\nR/J are Gorenstein by [1, Corollary 5.6.5], and dim R/J = dim R/I \u2212 1.\nThe proof of the following key lemma will be given in Subsection 3.3.\nLemma 3.2. There exists unique \u03c6 \u2208 HomR/I (J, R/I) such that \u03c6(v) = 0\nfor all v \u2208 Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 and \u03c6(zw) = wx1 xm for all w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 . Moreover,\nthe R/I-module HomR/I (J, R/I) is generated by the set {i, \u03c6}, where i : J \u2192\nR/I denotes the inclusion homomorphism.\nTaking into account Lemma 3.2, the Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection ring S\nof the pair J \u2282 R/I is equal to\nS=\n\n(R/I)[T ]\n.\n(T u \u2212 \u03c6(u) u \u2208 J)\n\nWe extend the grading of R to a grading of S by putting the degree of the\nnew variable T equal to 1. By Lemma 3.2 S is a graded k-algebra. Our\nmain result for the case d even is the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.3. The element z \u2208 S is S-regular, and there is an isomorphism\nof graded k-algebras\nS/(z) \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m + 1)].\nProof. Denote by Q \u2282 R[T ] the ideal\nQ = (I, z) + (T u \u2212 \u03c6(u) u \u2208 J) \u2282 R[T ].\nBy the definition of S we have S/(z) \u223c\n= R[T ]/Q. By the definition of \u03c6 we\nhave Q = (Ia,1,m , T Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 , z). Hence, Lemma 3.1 implies that S/(z) \u223c\n=\nk[\u2206(d, m + 1)]. As a consequence, dim S/(z) = dim S \u2212 1, and since by\n[10, Theorem 1.5] S is Gorenstein, hence Cohen\u2013Macaulay, we get that z is\nS-regular.\n\u0003\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n9\n\nExample 3.4.

The case d = 2 and d + 1 < m. Assume d = 2 and d + 1 < m. It\nis clear that \u2206(d, m) is just the (unique) triangulation of the 1-sphere S 1\nhaving m vertices. Hence \u2206(d, m + 1) is a stellar subdivision of \u2206(d, m),\nand the results of [3] apply.\nIn more detail, set R = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z], with the degree of all variables\nequal to 1.

Proof of Lemma 3.2. We start the proof of Lemma 3.2. Recall that\nI = (Ia,1,m\u22121 , Ia,2,m ) and J = (Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 , zIa\u22122,3,m\u22122 ). Since J is a codimension 1 ideal of R/I and R/I is Gorenstein, hence Cohen\u2013Macaulay, there\ne\nexists b \u2208 J which is R/I-regular.

[6, p. 60]. We need the following lemma.\nLemma 3.5. (a) We have that x1 xm vw = 0 (equality in R/I) for all v \u2208\nIa\u22121,2,m\u22121 and w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 .\n(b) We have s0 zw = wx1 xm (equality in K(R/I)) for all w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 .\nProof. Proof of (a). It is enough to show that x1 xm xV xW = 0 in k[\u2206(d, m)],\nwhenever xV is a generating monomial of Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 and xW is a generating\nmonomial of Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 , with V \u2282 {2, . . . , m \u2212 1} and W \u2282 {3, . . . , m \u2212 2}.\nConsider the set A = {1, m} \u222a V \u222a W . If 2 \u2208\n/ V it is clear that x1 xV = 0\nand, similarly, if m \u2212 1 \u2208\n/ V we have xm xV = 0.\nHence for the rest of the proof we can assume that 2 \u2208 V and m \u2212 1 \u2208 V .\nDenote by A1 = {1, . . . , p} the initial segment of A, and by A2 the final\nsegment of A. Since 2, m \u2212 1 \u2208\n/ W , we necessarily have that all odd elements\nof A1 \\{1} are in W \\V , and all even elements of A1 are in V \\W . If the largest\nelement p of A1 is not in V , the monomial with support (V \\A1 )\u222a{1, 3, . . . , p}\nis in I, hence x1 xV xW = 0. By a similar argument, if the smallest element\nof A2 is not in V we get xm xV xW = 0. So we can assume that both the\nlargest element of A1 and the smallest element of A2 are in V . By the above\ndiscussion, this implies that #(A1 \u2229 V ) = #(A1 \u2229 W ) + 1 and #(A2 \u2229 V ) =\n#(A2 \u2229 W ) + 1, hence #Wa = #Va + 1, where we set Va = V \\ (A1 \u222a A2 ) and\nWa = W \\ (A1 \u222a A2 ). Hence there exists a contiguous subset of Va \u222a Wa , say\nA3 = {i, i+1, . . . , j}, which starts with an element of W \\V then either stops\nor continuous with an element of V \\ W and finally finishes with an element\nof W \\ V . The monomial with support in (V \\ A3 ) \u222a {i, i + 2, . . . , j} is in I,\nhence we get xV xW = 0 which finishes the proof of part (a) of Lemma 3.5.\nWe now prove part (b) of the lemma. It is enough to show that (b1 +\nzb2 )wx1 xm = zw(b2 x1 xm ), for all w \u2208 W . For that it is enough to show\nx1 xm b1 w = 0, which follows from part (a).\n\u0003\nUsing Lemma 3.5, multiplication by s0 , which a priori is only an R/Ihomomorphism R/I \u2192 K(R/I), maps J inside R/I, so defines an R/Ihomomorphism \u03c6 : J \u2192 R/I. By the same Lemma 3.5, we have that \u03c6(v) =\n0, for all v \u2208 Ia\u22121,2,m\u22121 , and \u03c6(zw) = wx1 xm , for all w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 . Since\nan R/I-homomorphism is uniquely determined by its values on a generating\nset, the uniqueness of \u03c6 stated in Lemma 3.2 follows.\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n11\n\nWe will now prove the part of Lemma 3.2 stating that the R/I-module\nHomR/I (J, R/I) is generated by the set {i, \u03c6}.

Consequently, since R/I \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m)][z], R/J \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)][x1 , xm ] we\nget\n(3.1)\n\n\u03c9R/I \u223c\n= (R/I)(\u22121)\n\nand\n\n\u03c9R/J \u223c\n= (R/J)(\u22122).\n\nCombining (3.1) with the short exact sequence ([10, p. 563])\n0 \u2192 \u03c9R/I \u2192 HomR/I (J, \u03c9R/I ) \u2192 \u03c9R/J \u2192 0,\nwe get the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 R/I \u2192 HomR/I (J, R/I) \u2192 (R/J)(\u22121) \u2192 0.\nAs a consequence, HomR/I (J, R/I) is generated as an R/I-module by the\nsubset {i, \u03c8}, whenever \u03c8 \u2208 HomR/I (J, R/I) has homogeneous degree 1\nand is not contained in the R/I-submodule of HomR/I (J, R/I) generated\nby the inclusion homomorphism i. Hence, to prove HomR/I (J, R/I) = (i, \u03c6)\nis enough to show that there is no c \u2208 R/I with \u03c6 = ci. Assume such c\nexists. Let w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22122 be a fixed monomial generator. We then have\nczw = \u03c6(zw) = wx1 xm (equality in R/I), and since R/I is a polynomial\nring with respect to z we get wx1 xm = 0, which is impossible, since I =\n(Ia,1,m\u22121 , Ia,2,m ). Hence HomR/I (J, R/I) = (i, \u03c6), which finishes the proof\nof Lemma 3.2.\n4. The main theorem for d odd\nAssume k is a fixed field, and d, m two integers with d odd and 5 \u2264 d <\nm \u2212 1, the cases d = 3 and m = d + 1 are discussed in Subsections 4.1 and\n4.2 respectively. We set a = (d + 1)/2. Combining Proposition 3.1 with [1,\nExerc. 5.2.18] we get the following proposition.\nProposition 4.1. We have\nk[\u2206(d, m)] \u223c\n= k[x1 , . . . , xm ]/(Ia,2,m\u22121 , x1 xm Ia\u22121,3,m\u22122 ).\nRemark 4.2. By Proposition 4.1 and [1, Exerc. 5.2.18], for d \u2265 5 odd the\nideal defining k[\u2206(d, m)] is related to the ideal defining k[\u2206(d \u2212 1, m \u2212 1)].\nWe will use this in what follows to reduce questions for d odd to the easier\ncase d even. A similar remark also applies when d = 3.\n\n\f12\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nWe set R = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z1 , z2 ], where we put degree 1 for all variables.\nConsider the ideals I = (Ia,2,m\u22121 , x1 xm Ia\u22121,3,m\u22122 ) and J = (Ia\u22121,2,m\u22122 ,\nz1 z2 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22123 ) of R. It is clear that I \u2282 (Ia\u22121,2,m\u22122 ), hence I \u2282 J.\nBy Proposition 4.1 we have that R/I \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m)][z1 , z2 ] and R/J \u223c\n=\nk[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)][x1 , xm\u22121 , xm ]. Consequently, both rings R/I and R/J\nare Gorenstein by [1, Corollary 5.6.5], and dim R/J = dim R/I \u2212 1. The\nfollowing lemma is the analogue of Lemma 3.2 for the case d odd.\nLemma 4.3. There exists unique \u03c6 \u2208 HomR/I (J, R/I) such that \u03c6(v) = 0\nfor all v \u2208 Ia\u22121,2,m\u22122 and \u03c6(z1 z2 w) = x1 xm\u22121 xm w for all w \u2208 Ia\u22122,3,m\u22123 .\nMoreover, the R/I-module HomR/I (J, R/I) is generated by the set {i, \u03c6},\nwhere i : J \u2192 R/I denotes the inclusion homomorphism.\nProof. Taking into account Proposition 4.1 and Remark 4.2, Lemma 4.3\nfollows by the same arguments as Lemma 3.2.\n\u0003\nTaking into account Lemma 4.3, the Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection ring S\nof the pair J \u2282 R/I is equal to\nS=\n\n(R/I)[T ]\n.\n(T u \u2212 \u03c6(u) u \u2208 J)\n\nWe extend the grading of R to a grading of S by putting the degree of the\nnew variable T equal to 1. Lemma 4.3 tells us that S is a graded k-algebra.\nOur main result for the case d odd is the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4. The sequence z1 , z2 \u2208 S is S-regular, and there is an isomorphism of graded k-algebras\nS/(z1 , z2 ) \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m + 1)].\nProof. Denote by Q \u2282 R[T ] the ideal\nQ = (I, z1 , z2 ) + (T u \u2212 \u03c6(u) u \u2208 J) \u2282 R[T ].\nBy the definition of S we have S/(z1 , z2 ) \u223c\n= R[T ]/Q.\nDenote by g : R[T ] \u2192 R[xm+1 ] the k-algebra isomorphism which is uniquely\nspecified by g(zi ) = zi for i = 1, 2, g(xi ) = xi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1,\ng(xm ) = xm+1 and g(T ) = xm . It is easy to see that g(Q) = (Id,m+1 , z1 , z2 ).\nSince g is an isomorphism, we have using Proposition 4.1 that\nR[T ]/Q \u223c\n= R[xm+1 ]/(Id,m+1 , z1 , z2 ) \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m + 1)],\nhence S/(z1 , z2 ) \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m + 1)]. As a consequence, dim S/(z1 , z2 ) =\ndim S \u2212 2, and since by [10, Theorem 1.5] S is Gorenstein, hence Cohen\u2013\nMacaulay, we get that z1 , z2 is an S-regular sequence.\n\u0003\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n13\n\n4.1. The case d = 3 and d + 1 < m. Assume d = 3 and d + 1 < m.\nCombining [1, p. 229, Exerc. 5.2.18] with the discussion of Subsection 3.1 we\nhave the following picture. Set R = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z1 , z2 ], where we put degree\n1 for all variables. Consider the ideals I = (I2,2,m\u22121 , x1 xm I1,3,m\u22122 ) and\nJ = (I1,2,m\u22122 , z1 z2 ) of R. Then k[\u2206(d, m)][z1 , z2 ] \u223c\n= R/I. Moreover, we have\nI \u2282 J, that J \u2282 R/I is a codimension 1 ideal of R/I with R/J Gorenstein,\nand that if we denote by S the Kustin\u2013Miller unprojection ring of the pair\nJ \u2282 R/I then z1 , z2 is an S-regular sequence and S/(z1 , z2 ) \u223c\n= k[\u2206(d, m+1)].\n4.2.

Combinatorial interpretation of our construction\nWe fix d \u2265 2 even and m \u2265 d + 1, and we will give a combinatorial\ninterpretation of the constructions of Section 3. We introduce the notation\nR(m) = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z]. Consider the ideals Id,m and Jd,m of R(m) as defined\nin Section 3 if d \u2265 4 and m \u2265 d + 2, as defined in Subsection 3.1 if d = 2\nand m \u2265 d + 2, and as defined in Subsection 3.2 if d \u2265 2 and m = d + 1.\nNote that Id,m is the Stanley\u2013Reisner ideal of \u2206(d, m). We will inductively\nidentify Jd,m . We set Pd,m = Id,m : (x1 xm ), then\nPd,m = Istar\u2206(d,m) ({1,m}) + (xi i is not a vertex of star\u2206(d,m) ({1, m})),\nIt is clear that the ideal Pd,m of R(m) is monomial, and that no minimal\nmonomial generator of it involves the variables x1 , xm and z. We denote by\nP\u0302d,m the ideal of k[x2 , . . . xm\u22121 , z] which has the same minimal monomial\ngenerating set.\nIf d = 2 we have Jd,m = (Pd,m , z). Assume now d \u2265 4. It is easy\nto see that the ideal P\u0302d,m is equal to the image of the ideal Id\u22122,m\u22122 of\nR(m\u22122) under the k-algebra isomorphism R(m\u22122) \u2192 k[x2 , . . . xm\u22121 , z] that\n\n\f14\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nsends z to z and xi to xi+1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 2, hence P\u0302d,m is the Stanley\u2013\nReisner ideal of a simplicial complex isomorphic to \u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 2). The\nunprojection constructions described in Section 3 and Subsections 3.1, 3.2\nallow us to pass from the ideal Id\u22122,m\u22122 of R(m\u22122) to the ideal Id\u22122,m\u22121\nof R(m\u22121) , which is the Stanley\u2013Reisner ideal of \u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1). Denote\nby Qd,m \u2282 k[x2 , . . . , xm , z] the image of the ideal Id\u22122,m\u22121 under the kalgebra isomorphism R(m\u22121) \u2192 k[x2 , . . . , xm , z] that sends z to xm , xi to\nxi+1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 2, and xm\u22121 to z. It is then easy to see that Jd,m\nis the ideal of R(m) generated by the image of Qd,m under the inclusion\nof k-algebras k[x2 , . . . , xm , z] \u2192 R(m) . In particular, R(m) /(Jd,m , x1 , xm ) \u223c\n=\nk[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)], as already observed above.\nAssume now d \u2265 3 is odd and m \u2265 d + 1. Consider the ideal J as defined\nin Section 4. Using Remark 4.2, a similar combinatorial interpretation exists\nfor J in terms of the \u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 2) related to the star of the face {1, m}\nof \u2206(d, m) when d \u2265 5, and an analogous statement when d = 3. We leave\nthe precise formulations to the reader.\n6. The minimal resolution of cyclic polytopes\nCombining the results of Sections 3 and 4, we have that for d \u2265 4 and\nd + 1 < m, the Stanley-Reisner ring k[\u2206(d, m + 1)] can be constructed from\nthe Stanley\u2013Reisner rings k[\u2206(d, m)] and k[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)] using Kustin\u2013\nMiller unprojection. Moreover, we showed that a similar statement is true\nalso for the cases d = 2, 3 and m = d + 1. Using the Kustin\u2013Miller complex\nconstruction discussed in Subsection 2.3, we can inductively build a graded\nfree resolution of S, hence using Proposition 6.3 below of k[\u2206(d, m + 1)],\nstarting from the minimal graded free resolutions of k[\u2206(d, m)] and k[\u2206(d \u2212\n2, m \u2212 1)]. The following theorem, which will be proven in Subsection 6.1,\ntells us that in this way we get a minimal resolution. Subsection 6.2 contains\nexamples demonstrating the theorem and a link to related computer algebra\ncode.\nTheorem 6.1. For d \u2265 4 and d + 1 < m, the graded free resolution of\nk[\u2206(d, m+1)] obtained from the minimal graded free resolutions of k[\u2206(d, m)]\nand k[\u2206(d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1)] using the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction is\nminimal. For d = 2 or 3 and d + 1 < m, the graded free resolution of\nk[\u2206(d, m+1)] obtained from the minimal graded free resolution of k[\u2206(d, m)]\nand the appropriate Koszul complex (see Subsections 3.1 and 4.1) using the\nKustin\u2013Miller complex construction is also minimal.\nWe remark that in the proof of Theorem 6.1 we do not use the calculation of the graded Betti numbers of k[\u2206(d, m)] obtained by Schenzel [12]\nfor even d, and by Terai and Hibi [13] for odd d. Not only that, but in\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n15\n\nProposition 6.6 we recover their results, without using Hochster's formula\nor Alexander duality.\n6.1.

([1, Proposition 1.1.5]). Assume R = k[x1 , . . . , xn ] is a\npolynomial ring over a field k with the degrees of all variables positive, and\nI \u2282 R a homogeneous ideal. Moreover, assume that xn is R/I-regular. Denote by cF the minimal graded free resolution of R/I as R-module. We then\nhave that cF \u2297R R/(xn ) is the minimal graded free resolution of R/(I, xn )\nas k[x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ]-module, where we used the natural isomorphisms R \u2297R\nR/(xn ) \u223c\n= R/(xn ) \u223c\n= k[x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 ].\nThe following proposition is an immediate consequence of Equation (2.1).\n\n\f16\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nProposition 6.4. Assume k is a field and R1 = k[x1 , . . . , xn ], R2 = k[y1 , . . . , yn ]\nare two polynomial rings with the degrees of all variables positive. Assume\nI1 \u2282 R1 is a monomial ideal, and denote by I2 the ideal of R2 generated by\nthe image of I1 under the k-algebra homomorphism R1 \u2192 R2 , xi 7\u2192 yi , for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Obviously I2 is a homogeneous ideal of R2 . We claim that for\nall i \u2265 0 we have bi (R2 /I2 ) = bi (R1 /I1 ) (of course the graded Betti numbers\nbij of R2 /I2 and R1 /I1 may differ).\nProposition 6.5. Assume k is a field, R1 = k[x1 , . . . , xn , T ] and R2 =\nk[y1 , . . . , yn , T1 , T2 ] are two polynomial rings with the degrees of all variables\npositive, deg xi = deg yi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and deg T = deg T1 +deg T2 . Assume\nI1 \u2282 R1 is a homogeneous ideal, and denote by I2 \u2282 R2 the ideal generated\nby the image of I1 under the graded k-algebra homomorphism \u03c6 : R1 \u2192 R2\nspecified by \u03c6(xi ) = yi , for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t, and \u03c6(T ) = T1 T2 . Denote by cF1\nthe minimal graded free resolution of R1 /I1 as R1 -module. Then I2 is a\nhomogeneous ideal R2 , and the complex cF1 \u2297R1 R2 is a minimal graded free\nresolution of R2 /I2 as R2 -module. In particular, the corresponding graded\nBetti numbers bij of R1 /I1 and R2 /I2 are equal.\nProof. It is clear that I2 is a homogeneous ideal of R2 . By [6, Theorem 18.16]\n\u03c6 is flat. As a consequence, [6, Proposition 6.1] implies that the natural map\nI1 \u2297R1 R2 \u2192 I2 is an isomorphism of graded R2 -modules. By flatness, tensoring the minimal graded free resolution of I1 as R1 -module with R2 we get\nthe minimal graded free resolution of I2 as R2 -module, and Proposition 6.5\nfollows.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.1 will follow from the following more precise statement. Notice\nthat, as we already mentioned before, the statements about the graded Betti\nnumbers have been proven before by different arguments in [12, 13], but we\ndo not need to use their results.\nProposition 6.6. Assume d \u2265 2 and d + 1 < m. Set bij = bij (k[\u2206(d, m)]).\nThen the statement of Theorem 6.1 is true for (d, m). Moreover, we have\nthat if d is even then bij = 1 for (i, j) \u2208 {(0, 0), (m \u2212 d, m)},\nbi,d/2+i = \u03b7(d + 1, m + 1, i) + \u03b7(d + 1, m + 1, m \u2212 d \u2212 i),\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 d \u2212 1, and bij = 0 otherwise. If d is odd, then bij = 1 for\n(i, j) \u2208 {(0, 0), (m \u2212 d, m)},\nbi,[d/2]+i = \u03b7(d, m, i),\n\nbi,[d/2]+i+1 = \u03b7(d, m, m \u2212 d \u2212 i),\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 d \u2212 1, and bij = 0 otherwise.\nProof. We use induction on d and m. If d \u2265 2 and m = d+2 then k[\u2206(d, m)]\nis a codimension 2 complete intersection and everything is clear.\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n17\n\nThe next step, is to notice that, for d = 2 and m \u2265 3, Proposition 6.6\nfollows from [3, Proposition 5.7], since \u2206(2, m) is equal to \u2206P2 (m) defined\nin [3, Section 5].\nNow assume that d is even with d \u2265 4 and d + 3 \u2264 m, and, by the\ninductive hypothesis, Proposition 6.6 holds for the values (d \u2212 2, m \u2212 1) and\n(d, m). An easy computation, taking into account Proposition 6.2, shows\nthat the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction resolving k[\u2206(d, m + 1)] has\nthe conjectured graded Betti numbers. Since no degree 0 morphisms appear\nit is necessarily minimal. This finishes the proof for d even.\nAssume now d \u2265 3 is odd. Combining [1, Exerc. 5.2.18] with Propositions\n6.4 and 6.5 we get that, for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 d,\n(6.2)\n\nbi (k[\u2206(d, m)]) = bi (k[\u2206(d \u2212 1, m \u2212 1)]).\n\n(Of course the graded Betti numbers bij can, and in fact are, different for\nk[\u2206(d, m)] and k[\u2206(d \u2212 1, m \u2212 1)].) So we can reduce the case d odd to\nthe case d \u2212 1, by doing an almost identical induction on (d, m) as in the\ncase (d \u2212 1, m \u2212 1), noticing that the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction\nfor k[\u2206(d, m + 1)] has to be minimal, since we proved that the one for\nP\nk[\u2206(d \u2212 1, m)] is minimal and the corresponding numbers bi = j bij are\nequal by Equation (6.2). This finishes the proof of Proposition 6.6.\n\u0003\n6.2. Examples and implementation. In this subsection we demonstrate\nthe construction of the cyclic polytope resolution with a sequence of two examples. First we carry out the Kustin-Miller complex construction described\nin Subsection 2.3 for the step passing from the codimension 4 complete intersection J2,5 and the Pfaffian I2,5 to the codimension 4 ideal I2,6 . In the\nsecond step we pass from J4,7 and the Pfaffian I4,7 to I4,8 , using that J4,7\nis equal to I2,6 after a change of variables. At the end of the subsection we\ngive a link to computer algebra code where we implement our constructions.\nUsing the notation of Subsection 2.3, we will explicitly compute for each\nstep the auxiliary data \u03b1i , \u03b2i , hi , u and hence the differentials fi from the\ninput data ai and bi . The ideals I2,5 and I4,7 are Gorenstein codimension\n3, hence Pfaffian, and we will fix below a certain resolution for each of\nthem. In addition, we will also fix below a certain Koszul complex resolving\nJ2,5 = (z, x2 , . . . , x4 ).\nAssume q \u2265 3 is an odd integer and M is a skew-symmetric q \u00d7 q matrix\nwith entries in a commutative ring. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 q, we denote by pf i M the\nPfaffian ([1, Section 3.4]) of the submatrix of M obtained by deleting the\ni-th row and column of M . The main property of pf i M is that its square is\nthe determinant of the corresponding submatrix.\n\n\f18\n\nJANKO B\u00d6HM AND STAVROS ARGYRIOS PAPADAKIS\n\nWe will use the notation R(m) = k[x1 , . . . , xm , z] introduced in Section 5.\nFor d \u2265 2 even, we denote by Md the (d + 3) \u00d7 (d + 3) skew-symmetric\nmatrix with entries in R(d+3) whose (i, j) entry for i \u2264 j is zero except that\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d + 2 we have (Md )i,i+1 = xi and that (Md )1,d+3 = \u2212xd+3 . It is\nan easy calculation that\nId,d+3 = (pf i (Md ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 d + 3).\nIn addition, according to the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud theorem [2], the minimal\ngraded free resolution of R(d+3) /Id,d+3 is given by\nvt\n\nv\n\nM\n\nd\nd\nd\nd+3\nd+3\n\u2212\u2192\nR(d+3)\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nR(d+3)\n0 \u2192 R(d+3) \u2212\u2192\nR(d+3)\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere vd denote the 1\u00d7(d+3) matrix with (1, i) entry equal to (\u22121)i pf i (Md )\nand vdt denotes the transpose of vd .\nWe set R = R(5) and fix the following Koszul complex resolution of R/J2,5\na\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0 \u2192 R \u2212\u2192\nR4 \u2212\u2192\nR6 \u2212\u2192\nR4 \u2212\u2192\nR\n\n(6.4)\nwhere\n\nx4\n\n\u0001\nx2 ,\n\n0\n\uf8ec x2\na3 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212x4\n0\n\n\u2212x2\n0\nx3\n0\n\na1 = z\n\nx3\n\n\uf8eb\n\nx3\n\uf8ec\u2212z\na2 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed0\n0\n\uf8eb\n\nx4\n\u2212x3\n0\n0\n\nz\n0\n0\nx3\n\n0\nz\n0\nx4\n\nx4\n0\n\u2212z\n0\n\nx2\n0\n0\n\u2212z\n\n\uf8f6t\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\nz\uf8f8\nx2\n\n0\n0\n\u2212x2\nx4\n\n0\nx2\n0\n\u2212x3\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212x4 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\nx3 \uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8f6\nx3\n\uf8ec x4 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\na4 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed x2 \uf8f8 .\n\u2212z\n\uf8eb\n\nWe now discuss the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction for the step\npassing from (I2,5 , J2,5 ) to I2,6 , which corresponds to the unprojection of\nJ2,5 \u2282 R/I2,5 . We will use as input for the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction the resolution (6.4) of R/J2,5 and the case d = 2 of (6.3), which is a\nresolution of R/I2,5 . Performing the computations we obtain, in the notation of Subsection 2.3, the complex CS specified by h1 = h2 = 0, u = \u22121\nand the maps\n\u03b11 : R5 \u2192 R4 ,\n\u03b12 : R5 \u2192 R6 ,\n\nP5\n\ni=1 ci ei\n\nP5\n\ni=1 ci ei\n\n7\u2192 x1 (c5 e2 + c3 e3 ) + x4 c1 e4 + x5 (c2 e2 + c4 e4 )\n7\u2192 x1 (c2 e4 + c4 e6 ) + x5 c3 e5\n\n\u03b13 : R \u2192 R4 , e1 7\u2192 x1 x5 e4\n\n\fSTANLEY-REISNER RINGS ASSOCIATED TO CYCLIC POLYTOPES\n\n19\n\nand\nP4\n\n\u03b21 : R4 \u2192 R,\n\ni=1 ci ei\n\n\u03b22 : R6 \u2192 R5 ,\n\u03b23 : R4 \u2192 R5 ,\n\nP6\n\n7\u2192 \u2212x1 x5 c1 e1\n\ni=1 ci ei\n\nP4\n\ni=1 ci ei\n\n7\u2192 \u2212x1 (c1 e2 + c3 e4 ) \u2212 x5 c2 e3\n7\u2192 \u2212x1 (c2 e3 + c1 e5 ) \u2212 x4 c3 e1 \u2212 x5 (c1 e2 + c3 e4 ) ,\n\nwhere (ei )1\u2264i\u2264q denotes the canonical basis of Rq as R-module. Substituting\nx6 for T and 0 for z in the differential maps of CS we get the minimal\ngraded free resolution of R(6) /I2,6 . Moreover, substituting z for x1 in the\ndifferential maps of the resolution of R(6) /I2,6 just constructed we get the\nminimal graded free resolution of R(7) /J4,7 .\nWe now set R = R(7) and discuss the Kustin\u2013Miller complex construction for the step passing from (I4,7 , J4,7 ) to I4,8 , which corresponds to the\nunprojection of J4,7 \u2282 R/I4,7 .

Applying the ideas of the present paper, it constructs the resolution of the ideal Id,m for d even and m \u2265 d + 1 starting\nfrom Koszul complexes and the skew-symmetric Buchsbaum-Eisenbud resolution (6.3) of Id,d+3 . The functions in the package provide the user with the\noption to output all the intermediate data ai , bi , \u03b1i , \u03b2i , hi , u, fi in addition\nto the final resolution.\nAcknowledgements.
