An r-matching in a graph G is a set of r edges, no two of which have a vertex in\ncommon. The number of r-matchings in G will be denoted by p(G, r). We set p(G, 0) = 1 and define\nthe matching polynomial of G by\n\u03bc(G, x) =\n\nX\n\n\u230an/2\u230b\n\n(\u22121)r p(G, r)xn\u22122r .\n\nr=0\n\nWe shall denote the multiplicity of \u03b8 as a root of \u03bc(G, x) by mult(\u03b8, G). Let u \u2208 V (G), the graph\nobtained from G by deleting the vertex u and all edges that contain u will be denoted by G \\ u.\nInductively if u1 , . . . , uk \u2208 V (G), G \\ u1 . . . uk = (G \\ u1 . . . uk\u22121 ) \\ uk . Note that the order of which\nvertex is being deleted first is not important, that is, if i1 , . . . , ik is a permutation of 1, . . . , k, we have\nG \\ u1 . . . uk = G \\ u11 . . . uik . Furthermore if X = {u1 , . . . , uk }, G \\ X = G \\ u1 . . . uk .\nThe followings are properties of \u03bc(G, x).\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.

(Theorem 1.1 on p. 2 of [1])\n(a) \u03bc(G \u222a H, x) = \u03bc(G, x)\u03bc(H, x) where G and H are disjoint graphs,\n(b) \u03bc(G, x) = \u03bc(G \\ e, x) \u2212 \u03bc(G \\ uv, x) if e = {u, v} is an edge of G,\nP\n(c) \u03bc(G, x) = x\u03bc(G \\ u, x) \u2212 i\u223cu \u03bc(G \\ ui, x) where i \u223c u means i is adjacent to u,\nX\nd\n\u03bc(G, x) =\n\u03bc(G \\ i, x) where V (G) is the vertex set of G.\ndx\n\n(d)\n\ni\u2208V (G)\n\nIt is well known that all roots of \u03bc(G, x) are real. Throughout, let \u03b8 be a real number and mult(\u03b8, G)\ndenote the multiplicity of \u03b8 as a root of \u03bc(G, x). In particular, mult(\u03b8, G) = 0 if and only if \u03b8 is not a\nroot of \u03bc(G, x). By Theorem 5.3 on p. 29 and Theorem 1.1 on p. 96 of [1], one can easily deduce the\nfollowing lemma.\nLemma 1.3. Let G be a graph and u \u2208 V (G). Then\nmult(\u03b8, G) \u2212 1 \u2264 mult(\u03b8, G \\ u) \u2264 mult(\u03b8, G) + 1.\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1.3, we can classify the vertices in a graph with respect to \u03b8 as follows:\nDefinition 1.4. (see [2, Section 3]) For any u \u2208 V (G),\n(a) u is \u03b8-essential if mult(\u03b8, G \\ u) = mult(\u03b8, G) \u2212 1,\n(b) u is \u03b8-neutral if mult(\u03b8, G \\ u) = mult(\u03b8, G),\n(c) u is \u03b8-positive if mult(\u03b8, G \\ u) = mult(\u03b8, G) + 1.\nFurthermore if u is not \u03b8-essential but it is adjacent to some \u03b8-essential vertex, we say u is \u03b8-special.\nIt turns out that \u03b8-special vertices play an important role in the Gallai-Edmonds Decomposition\nof a graph (see [3]). One of our main result is a characterization of the set of these vertices in terms\nof \u03b8-barriers.\nNote that if mult(\u03b8, G) = 0 then for any u \u2208 V (G), u is either \u03b8-neutral or \u03b8-positive and no\nvertices in G can be \u03b8-special. By Corollary 4.3 of [2], a \u03b8-special vertex is \u03b8-positive. Therefore\nV (G) = D\u03b8 (G) \u222a A\u03b8 (G) \u222a P\u03b8 (G) \u222a N\u03b8 (G),\nwhere\nD\u03b8 (G) is the set of all \u03b8-essential vertices in G,\nA\u03b8 (G) is the set of all \u03b8-special vertices in G,\nN\u03b8 (G) is the set of all \u03b8-neutral vertices in G,\nP\u03b8 (G) = Q\u03b8 (G) \\ A\u03b8 (G), where Q\u03b8 (G) is the set of all \u03b8-positive vertices in G,\n2\n\n\fis a partition of V (G). Note that there is no 0-neutral vertices. So N0 (G) = \u2205 and V (G) = D0 (G) \u222a\nA0 (G) \u222a P0 (G).\nDefinition 1.5. (see [2, Section 3]) A graph G is said to be \u03b8-critical if all vertices in G are \u03b8-essential\nand mult(\u03b8, G) = 1.\nThe Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem describes a certain canonical decomposition of V (G) with\nrespect to the zero root of \u03bc(G, x). In [3], Chen and Ku proved the Gallai-Edmonds Structure Theorem\nfor graph with any root \u03b8.\nTheorem 1.6. (Theorem 1.5 of [3]) Let G be a graph with \u03b8 a root of \u03bc(G, x). If u \u2208 A\u03b8 (G) then\n(i) D\u03b8 (G \\ u) = D\u03b8 (G),\n(ii) P\u03b8 (G \\ u) = P\u03b8 (G),\n(iii) N\u03b8 (G \\ u) = N\u03b8 (G),\n(iv) A\u03b8 (G \\ u) = A\u03b8 (G) \\ {u}.\nTheorem 1.7. (Theorem 1.7 of [3]) If G is connected and every vertex of G is \u03b8-essential then\nmult(\u03b8, G) = 1.\nBy Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.7, it is not hard to deduce the following whose proof is omitted.\nFor convenience, a connected component will be called a component.\nCorollary 1.8.\n(i) A\u03b8 (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) = \u2205, D\u03b8 (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) = D\u03b8 (G), P\u03b8 (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) = P\u03b8 (G), and N\u03b8 (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) =\nN\u03b8 (G).\n(ii) G \\ A\u03b8 (G) has exactly |A\u03b8 (G)| + mult(\u03b8, G) \u03b8-critical components.\n(iii) If H is a component of G \\ A\u03b8 (G) then either H is \u03b8-critical or mult(\u03b8, H) = 0.\n(iv) The subgraph induced by D\u03b8 (G) consists of all the \u03b8-critical components in G \\ A\u03b8 (G).\nLet G be a graph. The number of odd components in G is denoted by codd (G). Recall the following\nfamous Berge's Formula.\nTheorem 1.9. mult(0, G) = maxX\u2286V (G) codd (G \\ X) \u2212 |X|.\nDefinition 1.10. Motivated by the Berge's Formula, a barrier set is defined to be a set X \u2286 V (G) for\nwhich mult(0, G) = codd (G\\X)\u2212|X|. An extreme set is defined to be the set for which mult(0, G\\X) =\nmult(0, G) + |X|.\nProperties of extreme and barrier sets can be found in [4, Section 3.3]. In fact a barrier set is an\nextreme set. An extreme set is not necessary a barrier set, but it can be shown that an extreme set is\ncontained in some barrier set. In general the union or intersection of two barrier sets is not a barrier\nset. However it can be shown that the intersection of two (inclusionwise) maximal barriers set is a\nbarrier set. A0 (G) is a barrier and extreme set. It can be shown that A0 (G) is in fact the intersection\nof all the maximal barrier sets in G. Here we extend this fact to A\u03b8 (G):\nTheorem 1.11. Suppose N\u03b8 (G) = \u2205. Then A\u03b8 (G) is the intersection of all maximal \u03b8-barrier sets\nin G.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nProperties of \u03b8-barrier sets\n\nThe number of \u03b8-critical components in G is denoted by c\u03b8 (G). An immediate consequence of part\n(a) of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.7 is the following inequality which is used frequently.\n\nmult(\u03b8, G \\ X) \u2265 c\u03b8 (G \\ X)\n\nfor any X \u2286 V (G).\n\n(1)\n\nWe prove the following analogue of Berge's Formula.\nTheorem 2.1. [Generalized Berge's Formula]\nmult(\u03b8, G) = max c\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2212 |X|.\nX\u2286V (G)\n\nProof. We claim that, c\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2264 |X| + mult(\u03b8, G) for all X \u2286 V (G). Suppose the contrary. Then\nc\u03b8 (G \\ X) > |X| + mult(\u03b8, G) for some X \u2286 V (G). Recall that mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) \u2265 c\u03b8 (G \\ X). Together\nwith Lemma 1.3, we have mult(\u03b8, G) \u2265 mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) \u2212 |X| > mult(\u03b8, G), a contradiction. Hence\nc\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2264 |X| + mult(\u03b8, G) for all X \u2286 V (G).\nNow it is sufficient to show that there is a set X \u2286 V (G) for which mult(\u03b8, G) = c\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2212 |X|.\nBy (ii) of Corollary 1.8 and taking X = A\u03b8 (G), we are done.\nDefinition 2.2. Motivated by the Generalized Berge's Formula, we define a \u03b8-barrier set to be a set\nX \u2286 V (G) for which mult(\u03b8, G) = c\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2212 |X|.\nWe define a \u03b8-extreme set to be a set X \u2286 V (G) for which mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) = mult(\u03b8, G) + |X|.\nNote that the definitions of 0-extreme set and extreme set coincide. But the definitions of 0-barrier\nset and barrier set are different. Our next proposition shows that a 0-barrier set is a barrier set.\nProposition 2.3. A 0-barrier set is a barrier set.\nProof. Let X be a 0-barrier set. Then c0 (G\\X) = mult(0, G)+|X|. Note that c0 (G\\X) \u2264 codd (G\\X).\nUsing Theorem 1.9, we conclude that codd (G \\ X) = mult(0, G) + |X|. Hence X is a barrier set.\nThe converse of Proposition 2.3 is not true. In Figure 1, X = {u, v} is a barrier set in G but it is\nnot a 0-barrier set.\n\nu\n\nv\n\nG=\nw\n\nz\n\nFigure 1.\n4\n\n\fHowever we have a weak converse of Proposition 2.3.\nProposition 2.4. A (inclusionwise) maximal barrier set is a maximal 0-barrier set.\nProof. Let X be a maximal barrier set. Note that |X| + mult(0, G) \u2265 mult(0, G \\ X) \u2265 codd (G \\ X) =\n|X| + mult(0, G), where the first inequality follows from Lemma 1.3 and the last inequality follows\nfrom the fact that X is a barrier set. Therefore, equality holds throughout whence mult(0, G \\ X) =\ncodd (G \\ X) and 0 is a root of multiplicity 1 in each of the odd components in G \\ X.\nWe claim that an odd component in G \\ X is 0-critical. Suppose the contrary. Let H be an\nodd component in G \\ X and H is not 0-critical. Then A0 (H) 6= \u2205. Now mult(0, H) = 1. By\n(ii) of Corollary 1.8, c0 (H \\ A0 (H)) = |A0 (H)| + 1. Since c0 (H \\ A0 (H)) \u2264 codd (H \\ A0 (H)), by\nTheorem 1.9, we conclude that codd (H \\ A0 (H)) = |A0 (H)| + 1. Therefore codd (G \\ (X \u222a A0 (H)) =\ncodd (G\\X)\u2212 1+ codd (H \\A0 (H)) = |X|+ mult(0, G)\u2212 1+ |A0 (H)|+ 1 = |X \u222a A0 (H)|+ mult(0, G). But\nthen X \u222a A0 (H) is a barrier set in G, a contrary to the maximality of X. Hence an odd component\nin G \\ X must be 0-critical. This means that codd (G \\ X) = c0 (G \\ X) and X is a 0-barrier set. By\nProposition 2.3, we conclude that X must be a maximal 0-barrier set.\nNow we shall study the properties of \u03b8-barrier and \u03b8-extreme sets.\nLemma 2.5. A subset of a \u03b8-extreme set is a \u03b8-extreme set.\nProof. Let X be an \u03b8-extreme set and Y \u2286 X. Now mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) = mult(\u03b8, G) + |X|. By Lemma\n1.3, mult(\u03b8, G \\ Y ) \u2264 mult(\u03b8, G) + |Y |. If Y is not \u03b8-extreme then mult(\u03b8, G \\ Y ) < mult(\u03b8, G) + |Y |,\nand by Lemma 1.3 again, mult(\u03b8, G\\X) \u2264 mult(\u03b8, G\\Y )+ |X \\Y | < mult(\u03b8, G)+ |X|, a contradiction.\nHence a subset of an \u03b8-extreme set is \u03b8-extreme.\nLemma 2.6. If X is a \u03b8-barrier [\u03b8-extreme] set and Y \u2286 X then X \\ Y is a \u03b8-barrier [\u03b8-extreme] set\nin G \\ Y .\nProof. Note that c\u03b8 (G\\X) = |X|+ mult(\u03b8, G). By Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 1.3, c\u03b8 (G\\X) \u2264 |X \\Y |+\nmult(\u03b8, G\\Y ) \u2264 |X \\Y |+mult(\u03b8, G)+|Y | = |X|+mult(\u03b8, G). Hence c\u03b8 (G\\X) = |X \\Y |+mult(\u03b8, G\\Y )\nand X \\ Y is a \u03b8-barrier set in G \\ Y .\nLemma 2.7. Every \u03b8-extreme set of G lies in a \u03b8-barrier set.\nProof. Let X be a \u03b8-extreme set and T = A\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u222a X. Then\nc\u03b8 (G \\ T ) = c\u03b8 (G \\ (A\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u222a X))\n= c\u03b8 ((G \\ X) \\ A\u03b8 (G \\ X))\n\n= |A\u03b8 (G \\ X)| + mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) (by (ii) of Corollary 1.8)\n= |A\u03b8 (G \\ X)| + mult(\u03b8, G) + |X| (X is \u03b8-extreme)\n\n= |T | + mult(\u03b8, G),\nand hence T is a \u03b8-barrier set.\n\nLemma 2.8. Let X be a \u03b8-barrier set. Then X is a \u03b8-extreme set.\n5\n\n\fProof. Recall from (1) that mult(\u03b8, G\\X) \u2265 c\u03b8 (G\\X). Since c\u03b8 (G\\X) = |X|+ mult(\u03b8, G), by Lemma\n1.3, we have\nmult(\u03b8, G) \u2265 mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) \u2212 |X| \u2265 c\u03b8 (G \\ X) \u2212 |X| = mult(\u03b8, G).\nHence mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) = mult(\u03b8, G) + |X| and so X is a \u03b8-extreme set.\nNote that in general a \u03b8-extreme set is not a \u03b8-barrier set. In Figure 1, X1 = {u} is a 0-extreme\nset but it is not a 0-barrier set.\nLemma 2.9. Let X be a \u03b8-barrier set and H be a component of G \\ X. Then either H is \u03b8-critical\nor mult(\u03b8, H) = 0.\nProof. Note that c\u03b8 (G \\ X) = |X| + mult(\u03b8, G). By Lemma 2.8, X is a \u03b8-extreme set. Therefore\nmult(\u03b8, G \\ X) = mult(\u03b8, G) + |X| = c\u03b8 (G \\ X). Now if H is not \u03b8-critical and mult(\u03b8, H) > 0, then by\n(1), mult(\u03b8, G \\ X) > c\u03b8 (G \\ X), a contradiction. Hence either H is \u03b8-critical or mult(\u03b8, H) = 0.\nLemma 2.10. Let X be a maximal \u03b8-barrier set. Let H be a component of G \\ X and mult(\u03b8, H) = 0.\nThen for all u \u2208 V (H), u is \u03b8-neutral in H. Furthermore for all Y \u2286 V (H) and Y 6= \u2205, c\u03b8 (H \\ Y ) \u2264\n|Y | \u2212 1.\nProof. Suppose H has a \u03b8-positive vertex, say u. Then mult(\u03b8, H \\ u) = 1. By (ii) of Corollary 1.8,\nc\u03b8 ((H \\ u) \\ A\u03b8 (H \\ u)) = |A\u03b8 (H \\ u)| + mult(\u03b8, H \\ u) = |A\u03b8 (H \\ u)| + 1. But then\nc\u03b8 (G \\ (X \u222a {u} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ u)) = c\u03b8 (G \\ X) + c\u03b8 ((H \\ u) \\ A\u03b8 (H \\ u))\n= |X| + mult(\u03b8, G) + |A\u03b8 (H \\ u)| + 1\n\n= |X \u222a {u} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ u)| + mult(\u03b8, G),\nand so X \u222a {u} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ u) is a \u03b8-barrier in G, a contrary to the maximality of X. Hence for all\nu \u2208 V (H), u is \u03b8-neutral in H.\n\nSince Y 6= \u2205, there is a y \u2208 Y . Let Y \u2032 = Y \\ y and H \u2032 = H \\ y. Note that mult(\u03b8, H \\ y) = 0\nsince y is \u03b8-neutral in H. By Theorem 2.1, c\u03b8 (H \u2032 \\ Y \u2032 ) \u2264 |Y \u2032 |. Since H \\ Y = H \u2032 \\ Y \u2032 , we have\nc\u03b8 (H \\ Y ) \u2264 |Y | \u2212 1.\nLemma 2.11. Let G be \u03b8-critical. Then for all Y \u2286 V (G) and Y 6= \u2205, c\u03b8 (G \\ Y ) \u2264 |Y | \u2212 1.\nProof. Since Y 6= \u2205, there is a y \u2208 Y . Let Y \u2032 = Y \\ y and G\u2032 = G \\ y. Note that mult(\u03b8, G \\ y) = 0\nsince y is \u03b8-essential in G. By Theorem 2.1, c\u03b8 (G\u2032 \\ Y \u2032 ) \u2264 |Y \u2032 |. Since G \\ Y = G\u2032 \\ Y \u2032 , we have\nc\u03b8 (G \\ Y ) \u2264 |Y | \u2212 1.\nIn general the union or intersection of two \u03b8-barrier sets is not necessary a \u03b8-barrier set. In Figure\n1, X2 = {u, v, w} and X3 = {v, w, z} are two 0-barrier sets. But X2 \u2229 X3 and X2 \u222a X3 are not a\n0-barrier set. However the intersection of two maximal \u03b8-barrier sets is a \u03b8-barrier set.\nTheorem 2.12. The intersection of two maximal \u03b8-barrier sets is a \u03b8-barrier set.\n\n6\n\n\fProof. Let X and Y be two maximal \u03b8-barrier sets. Let G1 , G2 , . . . , Gk be all the \u03b8-critical components\nof G \\ X and H1 , H2 , . . . , Hm be all the components of G \\ Y . Note that k = |X| + mult(\u03b8, G). Let\nXi = X \u2229 V (Hi ), Yi = Y \u2229 V (Gi ) and Z = X \u2229 Y . By relabelling if necessary we may assume that\nX1 , . . . , Xm1 6= \u2205, Y1 , . . . , Yk1 6= \u2205, but Xm1 +1 = * * * = Xm = Yk1 +1 = * * * = Yk = \u2205, and also that\nk1 \u2264 m1 . Note that Gk1 +1 , . . . , Gk are \u03b8-critical components in (G \\ X) \\ Y . So each of them is\ncontained in a component of G \\ Y . Now let us count the number of Gi 's where k1 + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k that\nare contained in some Hj .\nSuppose m1 + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Then Hj is a component in (G \\ X) \\ Y . So if Gi \u2286 Hj , we must have\nGi = Hj . Furthermore Gi is a component of G \\ Z. By Theorem 2.1, the number of such Gi 's is at\nmost c\u03b8 (G \\ Z) \u2264 |Z| + mult(\u03b8, G).\nSuppose 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m1 . Let Gi1 , . . . , Git be all the Gi 's that are contained in Hj . Then Gi1 , . . . , Git\nare \u03b8-critical components in Hj \\ Xj . By Lemma 2.9, Hj is either \u03b8-critical or mult(\u03b8, H) = 0. If\nmult(\u03b8, H) = 0, we have, by Lemma 2.10, c\u03b8 (Hj \\ Xj ) \u2264 |Xj | \u2212 1. If Hi is \u03b8-critical, we have, by\nLemma 2.11, c\u03b8 (Hj \\ Xj ) \u2264 |Xj | \u2212 1. Therefore in either cases, we have t \u2264 |Xj | \u2212 1.\nThe number of Gi 's where k1 + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k that are disjoint from Y is at most\nc\u03b8 (G \\ Z) +\n\nm1\nX\nj=1\n\n(|Xj | \u2212 1) \u2264 |Z| + mult(\u03b8, G) + |X \\ Z| \u2212 m1\n= |X| + mult(\u03b8, G) \u2212 m1\n\n= k \u2212 m1\n\u2264 k \u2212 k1 .\n\nSince this number is exactly k \u2212 k1 , we infer that equality must hold throughout. Hence c\u03b8 (G \\ Z) =\n|Z| + mult(\u03b8, G) and Z is a \u03b8-barrier set.\n\n3\n\nCharacterizations of A\u03b8 (G)\n\nA characterization of A\u03b8 (G) is that it is the minimal (inclusionwise) \u03b8-barrier set (see Theorem 3.5).\nFurthermore if N\u03b8 (G) = \u2205, we have another characterization of A\u03b8 (G), that is, it is the intersection\nof all maximal \u03b8-barrier sets in G (see Theorem 3.6).\nLemma 3.1. If X is a \u03b8-barrier or a \u03b8-extreme set then X \u2286 A\u03b8 (G) \u222a P\u03b8 (G).\nProof. By Lemma 2.8, we may assume X is a \u03b8-extreme. Let x \u2208 X. By Lemma 2.5, {x} is a \u03b8extreme set. Therefore mult(\u03b8, G \\ x) = mult(\u03b8, G) + 1 and x is \u03b8-positive. So x \u2208 A\u03b8 (G) \u222a P\u03b8 (G) and\nX \u2286 A\u03b8 (G) \u222a P\u03b8 (G).\nLemma 3.2. Let X be a \u03b8-barrier set. If X \u2286 A\u03b8 (G) then X = A\u03b8 (G).\nProof. Note that c\u03b8 (G \\ X) = mult(\u03b8, G) + |X|. By Lemma 2.9, we conclude that A\u03b8 (G \\ X) = \u2205. By\nTheorem 1.6, A\u03b8 (G \\ X) = A\u03b8 (G) \\ X. Hence X = A\u03b8 (G).\nWe shall require the following result of Godsil [2].\n7\n\n\fTheorem 3.3. (Theorem 4.2 of [2]) Let \u03b8 be a root of \u03bc(G, x) with non-zero multiplicity k and let u\nbe a \u03b8-positive vertex in G. Then\n(a) if v is \u03b8-essential in G then it is \u03b8-essential in G \\ u;\n(b) if v is \u03b8-positive in G then it is \u03b8-essential or \u03b8-positive in G \\ u;\n(c) if u is \u03b8-neutral in G then it is \u03b8-essential or \u03b8-neutral in G \\ u.\nLemma 3.4. Let u \u2208 P\u03b8 (G). Then A\u03b8 (G) \u2286 A\u03b8 (G \\ u).\nProof. If A\u03b8 (G) = \u2205, then we are done. Suppose A\u03b8 (G) 6= \u2205. Let v \u2208 A\u03b8 (G). Then v is adjacent to a\n\u03b8-essential vertex w. By Theorem 3.3, w is \u03b8-essential in G \\ u and v is either \u03b8-positive or \u03b8-essential\nin G \\ u. Suppose v is \u03b8-essential in G \\ u. Then mult(\u03b8, G \\ uv) = mult(\u03b8, G). By Theorem 1.6,\nu \u2208 P\u03b8 (G) = P\u03b8 (G \\ v). Since v is \u03b8-special in G, v is \u03b8-positive in G (see Corollary 4.3 of [2]). So\nmult(\u03b8, G \\ uv) = mult(\u03b8, G) + 2, a contradiction. Therefore v is \u03b8-positive in G \\ u. Since v is adjacent\nto w, we must have v \u2208 A\u03b8 (G \\ u). Hence A\u03b8 (G) \u2286 A\u03b8 (G \\ u).\nTheorem 3.5. Let X be a \u03b8-barrier set in G. Then A\u03b8 (G) \u2286 X. In particular, A\u03b8 (G) is the minimal\n\u03b8-barrier set.\nProof. By Lemma 3.1, X \u2286 A\u03b8 (G) \u222a P\u03b8 (G). We shall prove the result by induction on |X \u2229 P\u03b8 (G)|.\nSuppose |X \u2229P\u03b8 (G)| = 0. Then X \u2286 A\u03b8 (G) and by Lemma 3.2, X = A\u03b8 (G). Suppose |X \u2229P\u03b8 (G)| \u2265 1.\nWe may assume that if X \u2032 is a \u03b8-barrier set in G\u2032 with |X \u2032 \u2229 P\u03b8 (G\u2032 )| < |X \u2229 P\u03b8 (G)|, then A\u03b8 (G\u2032 ) \u2286 X \u2032 .\n\nLet x \u2208 X \u2229 P\u03b8 (G). By Lemma 2.6, X \u2032 = X \\ x is a \u03b8-barrier set in G\u2032 = G \\ x. By Lemma 3.1 and\nLemma 3.4, we have X \u2032 \u2286 A\u03b8 (G\u2032 )\u222aP\u03b8 (G\u2032 ) and A\u03b8 (G) \u2286 A\u03b8 (G\u2032 ). Therefore |X \u2032 \u2229P\u03b8 (G\u2032 )| < |X \u2229P\u03b8 (G)|.\nBy induction A\u03b8 (G\u2032 ) \u2286 X \u2032 . Hence A\u03b8 (G) \u2286 X.\nIn general, A\n\u221a\u03b8 (G) is not the intersection of all maximal \u03b8-barrier sets in G.\n\u221a For instance, in\nFigure 2, mult( 3, G) = 0 and A\u221a3 (G) = \u2205. Now {u} is the only maximal 3-barrier set. But\nA\u221a3 (G) 6= {u}. However we can show that A\u03b8 (G) is the intersection of all maximal \u03b8-barrier sets in\nG if N\u03b8 (G) = \u2205.\n\nu\nG=\n\nFigure 2.\n\n8\n\n\fTheorem 3.6. Suppose N\u03b8 (G) = \u2205. Then A\u03b8 (G) is the intersection of all maximal \u03b8-barrier sets in\nG.\nProof. By Theorem 3.5, A\u03b8 (G) is contained in the intersection of all maximal \u03b8-barriers in G. It is\nsufficient to show that for each x \u2208 V (G) \\ A\u03b8 (G) there is a maximal barrier that does not contain x.\nIf x \u2208 D\u03b8 (G), by Lemma 3.1, x is not contained in any \u03b8-barriers and thus any maximal \u03b8-barriers.\nSuppose x \u2208 P\u03b8 (G). Then x is contained in a component H in G \\ A\u03b8 (G) with mult(\u03b8, H) = 0. Note\nthat |V (H)| \u2265 2, for x \u2208 P\u03b8 (G) = P (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) and mult(\u03b8, H \\ x) = 1 (see Theorem 1.6). By (c)\nof Theorem 1.2 and the fact that mult(\u03b8, H) = 0, we deduce that there is a vertex y \u2208 V (H \\ x) for\nwhich mult(\u03b8, H \\ xy) = 0. Now y \u2208 P\u03b8 (G) for N\u03b8 (G) = \u2205. Furthermore x is \u03b8-essential in H \\ y.\nTherefore x \u2208\n/ A\u03b8 (H \\ y) and by (ii) of Corollary 1.8, c\u03b8 ((H \\ y) \\ A\u03b8 (H \\ y)) = |A\u03b8 (H \\ y)| + 1. Hence\nc\u03b8 (G \\ (A\u03b8 (G) \u222a {y} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ y))) = c\u03b8 (G \\ A\u03b8 (G)) + c\u03b8 ((H \\ y) \\ A\u03b8 (H \\ y))\n= |A\u03b8 (G)| + mult(\u03b8, G) + |A\u03b8 (H \\ y)| + 1\n\n= |A\u03b8 (G) \u222a {y} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ y)| + mult(\u03b8, G),\nand so A\u03b8 (G) \u222a {y} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ y) is a \u03b8-barrier set not containing x. Let Z be a maximal \u03b8-barrier set\ncontaining Y = A\u03b8 (G) \u222a {y} \u222a A\u03b8 (H \\ y). By Lemma 2.6, Z \\ Y is a \u03b8-barrier set in G \\ Y . Using\nTheorem 1.6 and the fact that x is \u03b8-essential in H \\ y, we can deduce that x \u2208 D\u03b8 (G \\ Y ). By Lemma\n3.1, we conclude that x \u2208\n/ Z \\ Y and hence x \u2208\n/ Z. The proof of the theorem is completed.\nSince N0 (G) = \u2205, by Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 2.4, we deduce the following classical result.\nCorollary 3.7.
