This model features a homogeneous and isotropic spatially-flat universe comprised\nof approximately 5% baryons, 25% cold dark matter, and 70% vacuum energy, with a\nradiation energy density of about 10\u22124 at a temperature 2.7\u25e6 K. Along with a nearly scalefree spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations, these ingredients provide an accurate\n1\n\n\fmatch to observations of the recent expansion history [1], large-scale structure [2], the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) [3], and the abundances of light elements as predicted\nby Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [4].\nAs successful as the best-fit model has been, it falls short of achieving an aura of\ninevitability due to certain problems of naturalness. Foremost among these are the two\ncosmological constant problems: why the vacuum energy is so small in comparison to its\nexpected value, and why its precise magnitude is so close to that of the matter energy density\ntoday [5]. In addition to these unsolved problems, there are problems for which a popular\nsolution exists but is lacking a firm experimental footing: the flatness and horizon problems,\nwhich may be solved by inflation, and of course the nature of the dark-matter itself. Finally,\namidst the large successes there are small failures of the best-fit model in fitting the data,\nespecially in the detailed matching of structure on small scales to the predictions of cold\ndark matter [6]. Meanwhile, numerous alternatives to conventional cosmology have been\nstudied. To take one recent example, brane-world models with large extra dimensions can\ngive rise to a variety of departures from four-dimensional general relativity, with important\nconsequences for the early universe [7, 8].\nGiven this situation, it is worth examining as carefully as possible the theoretical assumptions of the standard cosmological model, if for no other reason than to reassure\nourselves that its apparent fine-tunings are not pointing toward a radically different underlying framework. In this paper we consider the empirical evidence relating to the Friedmann equation, the dynamical relation in general relativity between the expansion rate of\nthe Universe and the energy density in it.\nThe fundamental quantity in general relativity is the space-time metric. We have some\nempirical evidence for the form of the metric from astronomical observations. We know\nthat the Universe is expanding [9], i.e., the physical volume of the Universe is increasing\nwith time. We also know that the cosmic microwave background is isotropic to a part in\n105 [10]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the spatial metric is isotropic. If we\nfurther assume that all observers (matter) in this expanding isotropic Universe see the same\nCMB isotropy, then it follows [11] that the Universe is homogeneous (on scales much larger\nthan that of the largest collapsed structure). The metric is then uniquely determined. The\nform of this metric, called the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric, is\ndr 2\n+ r 2 d\u03a92\nds = \u2212dt + a (t)\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor and k \u2208 {\u22121, 0, +1} is the curvature parameter. The Fried2\n\n\fmann equation (derived from general relativity for the RW metric) is\nH2 =\n\n\u0012 \u00132\n\n\u0227\na\n\n=\n\n8\u03c0G\nk\n\u03c1\u2212 2 .\n3\na\n\n(2)\n\nH = \u0227/a is the Hubble expansion rate and \u03c1 the energy density of the universe. In fact\n(2) is only the 00 component of Einstein's equations applied to (1); we also have another\nindependent gravitational equation,\n4\u03c0G\n\u00e4\n=\u2212\n(\u03c1 + 3p) ,\na\n3\n\n(3)\n\nas well as an equation of energy-momentum conservation,\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u22123(\u03c1 + p)\n\n\u0227\n,\na\n\n(4)\n\nwhere p is the pressure. In seeking to test this framework, we might hope to seek consistency\nrelations among these equations, which could be compared with data. Unfortunately, it\nis always possible to find an energy density \u03c1(t) and pressure p(t) which satisfy (2-4).\nSpecifically, any given expansion history a(t) and curvature k is compatible with these\nequations if we choose\nk\n\u0227 2\n3\n+ 2\n\u03c1 =\n8\u03c0G a\na\n\"\n#\n\u0012 \u00132\n1\nk\n\u00e4\n\u0227\np = \u2212\n+ 2 .\n2 +\n8\u03c0G a\na\na\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\n#\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThe crucial point here is that a perfectly smooth component of energy and pressure cannot\nbe detected in any way except for its influence on the expansion rate, so we have no\nindependent constraint on such a source. While invoking a perfectly smooth component to\nfit an arbitrary behavior of the scale factor might seem like cheating, this is exactly what we\nmust do to reconcile the strong evidence in favor of spatial flatness with the similarly strong\nevidence that the amount of clustered matter falls far short of the critical density in the\ncurrent universe. In this sense, the set of equations (2-4) are, strictly speaking, untestable,\nwithout some prior expectation for the nature of \u03c1 and p.\nInstead, we can characterize what observations can tell us about the behavior of the\nscale factor in a model-independent way, so that any specific alternative theory can be\nstraightforwardly compared with the data. There are only two eras of the universe's history\nin which such a characterization is possible: the recent universe, and the BBN era. In the\nrecent universe, information about the behavior of the scale factor can be obtained in a\n3\n\n\fvariety of ways, most directly by comparing the distance of faraway objects to their redshifts,\nas is done in the supernova studies that first revealed the acceleration of the universe [1].\nDuring BBN, the expansion rate directly affects the relative abundances of light elements\nproduced (as reviewed below), so that the primordial abundances are a powerful constraint\non alternative expansion histories.\nOther important observable phenomena which are affected by the expansion rate do not\noffer such a direct test, since they typically involve the local behavior of gravity (evolution\nof perturbations) in addition to its cosmological behavior (evolution of the scale factor).\nExamples include the growth of large-scale structure and the imprinting of temperature\nanisotropies on the CMB. A theory which predicts deviations from the Friedmann equation\ncould generically predict deviations from the predictions of general relativity on other scales.\nConsequently, it is difficult to use the growth of structure and CMB anisotropies as modelindependent tests of the Friedmann equation, although any fully-specified alternative theory\nmight be tightly constrained by these phenomena. However, if one assumes that the local\nbehavior of gravity as predicted by general relativity is correct, then structure formation\nand CMB anisotropies are a powerful probe of the expansion history (and hence dark energy\nevolution) after the last scattering epoch [12].\nIn this paper we will study what kinds of expansion histories in the early universe are\ncompatible with the BBN explanation of the light element abundances. Other works have\nconstrained the energy density [13] or value of Newton's constant [14] during BBN, assuming\nthe Friedmann equation, or have derived BBN constraints on specific scalar-tensor theories\n[15, 16] or have put limits on alternative cosmologies under the assumption that the universe\nhas undergone a consistent power-law evolution from very early times [17]. An estimate of\nthe constraints imposed by BBN (by considering the change in the neutron-proton freezeout temperature) and structure formation on cosmologies where the energy density in the\nuniverse varies as some power of H has also been calculated [8]. Our approach will be not to\nassume any specific behavior of the scale factor over long periods, but instead to introduce a\ntwo-parameter family of evolution histories which we take to be valid only in the vicinity of\nBBN. We find that a variety of alternative cosmologies can be consistent with observations,\nalthough they comprise essentially a one-dimensional region in our two-dimensional space\nof possibilities.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nParameterizing the scale factor during BBN\n\nWe will consider theories in which the field equations for the metric may be different from\nthose of general relativity, but we assume that test particles will still follow geodesics of this\nmetric. From this assumption it follows that the energy of a relativistic particle redshifts\nas 1/a. The photon temperature will be proportional to 1/a in the absence of entropy\ncreation; however, e\u00b1 annihilation can act as a significant entropy source. We therefore use\nthe neutrino temperature T as a measure of the scale factor, since T \u221d 1/a to excellent\naccuracy during the epoch under consideration. Of course these statements rely on our\ndecision to only consider changes in the gravitational dynamics, not any particle-physics\nprocesses.\nThe process of conventional BBN spans temperatures between the freeze-out of weak\ninteractions, Tf = 1 MeV, and the synthesis of helium, TBBN = 60 keV; this corresponds to\na change in the scale factor by slightly more than one order of magnitude. It will therefore\nbe reasonable to approximate the expansion rate during this interval, so long as it is not\nwildly oscillating or somehow finely tuned, as a simple power law:\nT\nH(T ) =\n1 MeV\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u03b1\n\nH1 .\n\n(7)\n\nAny expansion history is parameterized by the coefficient H1 and the exponent \u03b1. (One\ncan view this as a Taylor expansion in log(H), to first order in log(T ).) We do not extend\nthis parameterization beyond the BBN epoch, nor are we proposing any models in which\n(7) is predicted (but note that all the models in [7, 8] are well described by this expansion\nlaw); this is a phenomenological study of the expansion rate during BBN. It should also\nbe noted that there might exist models which are not accurately described by power-law\nexpansion during the BBN era [16]; in such cases it would be necessary to examine each\nmodel individually.\nIn standard BBN weak interactions freeze out close to Tf = 1 MeV, at which point\nn/p(Tf ) \u2248 1/6. At temperatures lower than Tf , the only change in the neutron to proton\nratio occurs due to free decay of neutrons with a lifetime of \u03c4n = 887 sec. At temperatures\nmuch lower than freeze-out, it becomes possible to synthesize helium in appreciable quantities. This happens at a temperature of TBBN = 60 keV, and essentially all the remaining\nneutrons (one per seven protons) are bound into helium nuclei. It should be noted that\nthis temperature (TBBN ) is much lower than the binding energies of all the light elements.\nClearly, the large photon to baryon ratio (which implies a large photo-dissociating background) is partly responsible for this [18]. The rate at which n \u2192 4 He conversion occurs\n5\n\n\fdepends on the destruction rate of deuterium which in turn depends on the binding energy\nof deuterium, the formation rate of tritium and the baryon to photon ratio. In standard\nBBN, it turns out that the conditions for helium synthesis are just right when the helium\nformation rate is larger than 1/\u03c4n [19]. This picture breaks down in the unconventional\nexpansion histories we consider.\nAn understanding of how alternative models affect light-element abundances can be\nexpressed in terms of the behavior of three characteristic quantities: the freeze-out temperature Tf (which sets the initial neutron/proton ratio), the time interval between freeze-out\nand nucleosynthesis, \u2206tBBN = tBBN \u2212 tf (during which neutrons decay), and the Hubble\nparameter at nucleosynthesis, HBBN (which affects the efficiency with which neutrons are\nconverted to helium, and thus determines the deuterium and lithium abundances). Note\nthat \u2206tBBN \u2248 tBBN , since tf << tBBN ; this will continue to be true in the non-standard\nmodels we study. Assuming only that H is monotonically decreasing even prior to the\nepoch when this formula is relevant, we will have\ntBBN =\n\n1\n.\n\u03b1HBBN\n\n(8)\n\nThe predictions of Big-Bang nucleosynthesis are given as ratios of abundances of the\nlight elements \u2013 neutrons (n), protons (p or H), deuterium (D), 3 H, 3 He, 4 He and 7 Li. One\nquotes the ratio of the number density of the light elements to the number of protons,\nexcept in the case of helium where the accepted practice is to quote its mass fraction (YP ).\nThe absolute density of these light elements is set by the absolute density of baryons. The\nonly input parameter in standard BBN is the baryon density quoted as its ratio (\u03b7) to the\nnumber density of photons. It is useful to define \u03b710 = 1010 \u03b7 since the number density\nof baryons (compared to that of photons) is very small. Except for a brief period when\nelectrons and positrons annihilate, \u03b7 remains constant (provided no other entropy changing\ninteractions come into equilibrium).\nWe will adopt observationally allowed ranges of light elements ratios in keeping with\nthe inferences (but slightly on the conservative side) of Olive et al. [20]. The ranges are\n0.228 \u2264 YP \u2264 0.248, 2 \u2264 105 \u00d7 D/H \u2264 5, and 1 \u2264 1010 \u00d7 7 Li/H \u2264 3. The low deuterium\nvalue has been adopted since it seems to be favored by current data [21].\nThe baryon density is not as well constrained observationally as the ratios of light\nelement abundances. One reason for this is that we can only inventory the baryons that\nwe see and most of the baryons could be dark. Even putting a lower bound on the baryon\ndensity is a difficult task. Persic and Salucci [22] estimated the density of baryons in the\n6\n\n\fUniverse (in terms of \u03b710 ) to be \u03b710 \u2265 0.3. In converting the baryon density to \u03b7 we have\nassumed that \u03b7 has remained constant since BBN (as it does in the standard model), and\nthat H0 \u2265 60 km s\u22121 [23] where H0 is the present expansion rate of the Universe. Fukugita\net al. [24] also did a baryon inventory and their bound on the baryon density translates to\n\u03b710 \u2265 1.8, a much higher lower bound on the baryon density. We will use both these lower\nbounds as a way of showing how the allowed region changes with the bound on the baryon\ndensity.\nWithout recourse to a specific theory of gravity it is not possible to put an upper bound\non the baryon density. For our purposes, we will assume the following ranges for the\nbaryon density \u2013 a tight bound corresponding to 1 \u2264 \u03b710 \u2264 10 and a broader range with\n0.5 \u2264 \u03b710 \u2264 50. We will also comment on what happens if the upper bound on the baryon\ndensity is increased.\n\n3\n\nHelium constraints\n\nThe requirement that about 24% helium by mass be synthesized imposes severe constraints\non the expansion history for temperatures around TBBN . To understand these constraints,\nit proves useful to look at the effects of changes in the parameters H1 and \u03b1 of (7) in the\nvicinity of the standard model. We first concentrate on the effect of changing H1 at fixed\n\u03b1. As mentioned, the important considerations are the freeze-out temperature Tf , and\nthe time interval between freeze-out and nucleosynthesis \u2206tBBN \u2248 tBBN . (In the vicinity\nof standard BBN, small changes in the expansion rate HBBN will not be important, since\nessentially all neutrons are converted to helium.) Increasing H1 increases the expansion\nrate at every temperature; thus, freeze-out will occur earlier (Tf will be higher) leading to\na larger initial neutron/proton ratio. At the same time, the faster expansion rate leads to a\ndecrease in tBBN , leaving less time for neutrons to decay. Both these effects go in the same\ndirection and hence the neutron/proton ratio at TBBN increases with increasing H1 , leading\nto a higher helium abundance.\nOne can analyze the effect of changing \u03b1 at fixed H1 in a similar manner. Again, the\nrelevant considerations in the vicinity of standard BBN are the behaviors of Tf and \u2206tBBN .\nSince H1 corresponds to a temperature close to freeze-out and before helium synthesis, increasing \u03b1 means that the expansion rate will be lower during nucleosynthesis. In particular\nthis implies that HBBN will be lower (i.e., helium synthesis happens later), and hence that\nthe time interval \u2206tBBN \u221d 1/HBBN will be longer. Consequently, increasing \u03b1 at fixed H1\n\n7\n\n\fgives neutrons more time to decay between Tf and TBBN , working to decrease the helium\nabundance for values close to the standard ones.\nWe can therefore balance the effects of increasing H1 against those of increasing \u03b1,\nto obtain a constant helium abundance for small deviations from the standard picture.\nIn Figure 1 we plot contours of constant 4 He in the \u03b1-H1 plane. This figure reveals the\n18\n16\n14\n\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\u03b1\n\nFigure 1: Contours representing constant helium in the \u03b1-H1 plane, for YP = 0.24. We\nhave chosen \u03b7 = 10\u221210 (filled circles) and \u03b7 = 10\u22129 (squares) for purposes of illustration.\nexpected behavior in the vicinity of the standard model, but we see that the curves turn\nover, and at fixed \u03b1 there is a larger value of H1 for which the helium abundance is the\nsame. This feature has been previously noted in the context of exploring the effects of\nvery large numbers of light neutrino species (and thus H1 ) [25] and in the explorations of\nBBN constraints on scalar-tensor theories of gravity [26]. For very large H1 , the freezeout temperature is sufficiently high that n/p(Tf ) asymptotes to unity; \u2206tBBN continues\nto decrease as H1 increases, leading to an ever-larger neutron fraction at nucleosynthesis.\nHowever, HBBN also increases and eventually the expansion rate at nucleosynthesis is so\nlarge that there is not enough time to efficiently turn the neutrons into helium. Thus,\ngiven the success of standard BBN, there will be an additional larger value of H1 (at the\nstandard value \u03b1 = 2) for which the helium abundance is the same. This argument can be\ngeneralized not just to other values of \u03b1 but also to the other light element abundances.\n8\n\n\fOne expects (at fixed \u03b1) to get two values of HBBN which produce the same abundance.\n\n4\n\nDeuterium and Lithium constraints\n\nThe deuterium abundance provides an important additional constraint on the allowed parameter space. In the standard picture deuterium is a by-product of neutrons getting burnt\nto helium. Since the abundance of deuterium is set by its destruction rate and the time\navailable for this destruction, it is extremely sensitive to the expansion rate at temperatures\nclose to TBBN . Around the standard model, D/H increases with H1 for a fixed \u03b1, since the\ntime available for nucleosynthesis decreases. If one fixes H1 , the decrease in post-BBN\n< TBBN ) expansion rate causes D/H to decrease with increasing \u03b1. Once again we see\n(T \u223c\nthat there is a trade-off to be made between \u03b1 and H1 , and hence it is possible to increase\n\u03b1 and H1 simultaneously such that we end up with the same deuterium abundance. This is\nborne out by the contours of constant deuterium plotted in Figure 2. Note that one expects\nexactly the opposite behavior with respect to changes in \u03b1 (with H1 fixed), and H1 (with\n\u03b1 fixed) for the upper branch of contour plot. Essentially, the abundances in the upper\nbranch of the contour plot increase if the time available for nucleosynthesis goes up.\n18\n16\n14\n\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\u03b1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFigure 2: Contours of constant deuterium, D/H= 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 , at \u03b7 = 10\u221210 (filled circles) and\n\u03b7 = 10\u22129 (squares).\n\n9\n\n\fFrom Figure 2 it is clear that the lower branch of the contour plot turns over at large \u03b1.\nThis can be traced to the appearance of a new production channel. As \u03b1 increases without\na corresponding exponential increase in H1 , the time available for nucleosynthesis becomes\nvery large, and consequently deuterium is almost completely destroyed. In the lower branch\nthis implies that beyond a certain value of \u03b1 it would not be possible to produce a reasonable\nD/H abundance. However, if the age of the Universe gets large enough it becomes possible\nto produce deuterium by pp fusion, in a manner similar to what happens in the sun. This\npp burning explains the turn over towards smaller values of H1 in the lower branch of the\ndeuterium contour. For this solution to work, the age during nucleosynthesis has to be of\nthe order of billions of years. We, therefore, consider this solution highly unlikely and do\nnot include it in our analysis.\nFor our parameter space around the standard model we expect the same behavior with\nrespect to \u03b7 as in standard BBN. All other things being the same, increasing \u03b7 decreases\ndeuterium abundance while increasing YP due to more efficient nucleosynthesis. Thus at\nfixed \u03b1 if \u03b7 is increased, then one needs to decrease H1 to lower the helium abundance back\nto where it was. In the case of deuterium, if \u03b7 is increased at fixed \u03b1, then one needs to\nincrease H1 in order to increase D/H back to where it was.\nNote that for the upper branch one would have to increase H1 at fixed \u03b1 to compensate\nfor an increase in \u03b7 for both helium and deuterium, since both YP and D/H increase with \u03b7\nin the upper branch.\nWe can infer the primordial abundance of 7 Li very accurately from poor-metallicity stars\n[20]. Therefore, it provides an additional constraint on our parameter space. For most of\nthe parameter space, getting helium right automatically ensures that lithium is near the\nobserved abundance. Even so, with the very tight bounds on 7 Li/H that we impose, lithium\ndoes provide strong constraints. Figure 3 shows contours of constant lithium in the H1 \u2013\u03b1\nplane. Its behavior with respect to a change in \u03b7 follows that of helium.\nThe 7 Li iso-abundance contour has two interesting features not present in the helium\ncontour, which can be traced to the fact that 7 Li has two distinct production channels.\n7\nLi can be produced through the reaction 4 He(3 H,\u03b3)7 Li, and through 4 He(3 He,\u03b3)7 Be with\nthe subsequent beta-decay of 7 Be. Fixing our attention on the lower branch of the lithium\ncontour, as we move from low to high \u03b1, the dominant production channel changes from\nthe direct 7 Li channel to the indirect 7 Be one. The kink in the lower branch of the contour\nis at values of \u03b1 where this transition takes place. At large \u03b1 and H1 , there is a small\nclosed contour below the upper branch. For a fixed \u03b1 in the region spanning the width of\n\n10\n\n\f18\n16\n14\n\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\u03b1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFigure 3: Contours of constant lithium, 7 Li/H= 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 , at \u03b7 = 10\u221210 (filled circles) and\n\u03b7 = 10\u22129 (squares).\nthe small closed contour, there are three values of H1 which produce the required lithium\nabundance. The solution with the lowest value of H1 produces 7 Li through the indirect 7 Be\nchannel. In the upper branch of the contour 7 Li production is through the direct channel,\nfor all values of \u03b1. A larger H1 means shorter time for nucleosynthesis and since 3 H is easier\nto burn than 3 He, the direct channel dominates.\n\n5\n\nCombined constraints\n\nPutting together all of our constraints yields the allowed region shown in Figure 4. We note\nthat the allowed region is essentially one dimensional, and is characterized by an almost\nlinear relationship between log(H1 ) and \u03b1. This tells us that there must exist a temperature\nTc at which the expansion rate Hc is approximately fixed for all the models in the allowed\nrange. In other words, we must have\nH1 = Hc (Tc / MeV)\u03b1 ;\n\nHc = (0.039 \u00b1 0.013)/sec at Tc = 0.2 MeV .\n\n(9)\n\nThe range of Hc quoted in Eq. 9 corresponds to our conservative limits on the baryon\nto photon ratio. For the case with the tighter bound on baryon density, we obtain Hc =\n11\n\n\f(0.03\u00b10.004)/sec. The value of Tc reflects of the physics involved. 4 He is primarily sensitive\nto H1 (as well as to \u03b1), while the other elements (which can be viewed as by-products of the\nneutron to helium burning process) are mainly sensitive to HBBN . Thus, not surprisingly,\nwe have 1 MeV > Tc > TBBN .\n\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\u03b1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 4: Allowed values of \u03b1 and H1 which lead to acceptable light element abundances.\nUpper panel shows the allowed parameter space when we constrain \u03b710 to be between 1 and\n10. The lower panel shows the allowed parameter space for 0.5 \u2264 \u03b710 \u2264 50.\nThe coincidence that Tc is so close to the e\u00b1 annihilation temperature (\u2243 me /3 =\n0.17 MeV) implies that the expansion rate of the Universe during e\u00b1 annihilation must\nhave been close to the standard BBN value. This in turn implies that the cosmic microwave background will retain a black body spectrum through the annihilation epoch (as\nin standard BBN) in all the viable non-standard expansion histories we have identified.\nThe effect of a change in the assumed range of the baryon density on the bounds on \u03b1\nis visible in Figure 4. Decreasing the lower bound on \u03b7 increases the upper bound on \u03b1,\nwhile allowing for larger baryon densities implies a smaller lower bound on \u03b1. The reason\nbehind such behavior is not hard to understand. Given that the expansion rate at 0.2 MeV\nis approximately fixed, a viable expansion history with larger \u03b1 has lower HBBN . A lower\nHBBN (i.e., more time for nucleosynthesis) at fixed baryon density implies a lower deuterium\nabundance. Thus one requires a smaller baryon density to get deuterium abundance right\n12\n\n\fin the limit of large \u03b1. Similarly, decreasing the lower bound on \u03b1 requires larger baryon\ndensities.\nAs discussed before, we do not really have an observational upper bound on the baryon\ndensity of the Universe in the absence of a theory of gravity. The lower bound is on a more\nsound footing because we can count the visible baryons. Thus it seems pertinent to ask what\nhappens if one allows for larger cosmological baryon densities. From our arguments above\nwe would expect viable models with smaller values of \u03b1. However, increasing \u03b710 above 50\n(panel 2 of Figure 4) has no effect on the allowed range of \u03b1. The reason behind this result\nis best understood through the following qualitative picture. At smaller values of \u03b1, and\ntherefore larger HBBN , one has a higher deuterium abundance if the baryon density is fixed.\nTo lower the deuterium abundance to required levels one has to increase the baryon density.\nHowever, a larger baryon density (keeping \u03b1 fixed) will lead to a larger helium fraction.\nHence below a certain value of \u03b1 (which depends on the constraints on the abundances)\nit is not possible to simultaneously obtain the correct amounts of deuterium and helium.\nThis is also the reason why the allowed contour in the lower panel of Figure 4 does not\nappear to close.\n\n6\n\nNeutrino asymmetry\n\nOne of parameters in cosmology on which we have little handle is the neutrino asymmetry,\ni.e., the excess of neutrinos over anti-neutrinos or vice versa. This excess or deficit can\nbe quantified by the neutrino chemical potential, \u03bc, which enters into the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution function, given by 1/[1 + exp(p/T + \u03bc/T )]. The chemical potential of antineutrinos is \u2212\u03bc. The ratio \u03bc/T is an invariant, as long as there are no entropy-changing\nprocesses which involve neutrinos.\nThere are no compelling experimental or theoretical reasons to expect the neutrino\n(lepton) asymmetry (\u221d (\u03c0 2 + \u03bc2 /T 2 )\u03bc/T ) to be orders of magnitude different from the\nbaryon asymmetry. In fact, one might very well argue that it would only be natural for\nthe baryon and lepton asymmetries to be comparable if they were formed by the same\nprocesses. However, we have no concrete experimental hints to back up our theoretical\nprejudice. Moreover, in our framework, the value of \u03bc/T is virtually unconstrained (but for\nBBN) since the standard cosmological bounds [27] do not apply. Note that in order to probe\n\u03bc/T \u223c 1 regime, one would require experiments which are capable of measuring neutrino\nenergies down to 10\u22123 eV. As we shall shortly see, BBN even without the assumption of\n\n13\n\n\fstandard gravity provides us with constraints on the value of the electron neutrino chemical\npotential in the |\u03bc/T | = O(1) regime.\nChanging the neutrino chemical potential affects the neutrino number density. In standard BBN, a change in the neutrino number density affects the expansion rate and hence\nthe abundances. Clearly, this effect is non-existent in our study. The electron neutrino\nchemical potential also affects the n \u2194 p reaction rates. This is the effect we shall be concerned with in this section. From here on, \u03bc/T will implicitly refer to the electron neutrino\nchemical potential.\n> 1) on BBN have\nDetailed calculations of the effect of non-negligible \u03bc/T (i.e., |\u03bc/T | \u223c\nbeen performed [28]. The salient points are (1) the equilibrium value of n/p is modified by\na factor of exp(\u2212\u03bc/T ) from that when \u03bc = 0, (2) the neutrino decoupling and n-p freezeout temperatures are changed. The first point clearly implies the constraint, \u03bc/T < 2, if a\nhelium-4 mass fraction of 24% is to be synthesized. In Figure 5 we plot the allowed contours\nin \u03b1 \u2013 H1 plane. The contours are labelled by the value of \u03bc/T . We have restricted YP to\nbeing 24.4%. Allowing for our previously adopted range in YP will not change the result\nmuch as is apparent from the fact that the allowed contours in Figure 4 are practically\n1-dimensional. We note that if \u03b1 is set equal to 2, then we are back to standard cosmology;\nFigure 5 then provides us with the constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of\nfreedom (\u221d H1 ) [28].\nThe principal feature in Figure 5 is the trend of the required value of H1 being larger for\nlarger \u03bc/T . At larger \u03bc/T , the equilibrium value of n/p is smaller, and hence to compensate\nfor that tBBN must be smaller or H1 larger. For \u03bc/T < \u221210 no solutions were found, which\nowes to the fact that at the small values of H1 required to produce the right helium-4, tBBN\ngets so large that one cannot synthesize acceptable amounts of D/H.\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have shown that the viable (i.e., satisfying BBN abundance constraints) expansion\nhistories can be well approximated by the range of allowed values of \u03b1, for a fixed value\nof \u03bc/T . Lets concentrate on the more \"natural\" |\u03bc/T | << 1 (equivalent to \u03bc = 0) case.\nGiven the allowed range of \u03b1 one can generate the allowed range of expansion rates at any\ntemperature from about an MeV to 50 keV by using\nH(T ) = Hc (T /Tc )\u03b1 .\nWe have plotted the history of these viable non-standard Universes in Figure 6.\n14\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\n1.8\n\n3\n2\nLog(H1 x sec)\n\n1\n1\n0\n\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\n\u22128\n\n\u22123\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u03b1\n\nFigure 5: Allowed values of \u03b1 and H1 for YP = 0.244 and 0.5 \u2264 \u03b710 \u2264 50. The contours are\nlabelled by the value of \u03bc/T . No solutions consistent with our constraints were obtained\nfor \u03bc/T > 2 and \u03bc/T < \u221210.\nThe most interesting result of our study is that there is a range of expansion histories\nthat are compatible with the observed light-element abundances. There is therefore room for\nsubstantial deviation from the standard cosmological model at early times, while remaining\nconsistent with empirical evidence. On the other hand, it is encouraging to note that our\nallowed region (essentially one-dimensional) is only a small volume of the entire parameter\nspace. In this sense it would be unlikely to find that any particular model was both very\ndifferent from the standard picture, and consistent with the data.\nWe have also considered the effect of a large neutrino chemical potential. Independent\nof general relativity, BBN constrains the value of the electron neutrino chemical potential\nto \u221210 < \u03bc/T < 2. Of course, this increases the allowed range of H1 considerably, as can\nbe gauged from Figure 5.\nThroughout this discussion we have assumed tight but reasonable bounds [20] on the\nlight element abundances. Our quantitative results are sensitive to the assumed ranges. As\nobservations improve further, it will be possible to precisely pin down the expansion history\nof the Universe during the epoch of nucleosynthesis.\n\n15\n\n\f2\n\n\u22121\n\nlog(H/s )\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22124\n\n\u221210\n\n\u22129.5\n\n\u22129\n\n\u22128.5\n\nlog(a/a0)\nFigure 6: The expansion rate H as a function of scale factor a, for the family of allowed models in our parameterization (corresponding to our conservative limits on the baryon/photon\nratio and negligible electron neutrino asymmetry).
