These include Landau-Lifshitz (LL) and Krichever-Novikov (KN) equations, as well as elliptic Toda lattice (ETL) and elliptic Ruijsenaars-Toda lattice (ERTL).\nThe latter two systems are less known; they will be discussed in detail in this paper (the\nword \"elliptic\" in their names refers to their relation to an elliptic curve). We will explain\nhow all these models can be unified on the basis of a single equation introduced in [2] as\nthe nonlinear superposition formula for B\u00e4cklund transformations of the KN equation,\nand studied further in [6, 18]. We will denote it Q4 , following [6]. This discrete model\nplays the role of the \"master equation\" in the (sl2 part of) 2D integrability: most of\nother models in this area can be obtained from this one by certain limiting procedures.\nSome of the interrelations have been known for a while, but several important parts of\nthe picture were discovered only recently.

The first\nline contains totally discrete systems on planar graphs studied recently in [3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8],\nsee also [15, 19]. The link between Q4 and discrete ETL is a sort of reduction related\nwith black-white coloring of quad-graphs, which was discovered in [7]. The transition\n\u0393 \u2192 Z2 is just the specification of the general construction to the most important cases\nof regular lattices. Discrete equations in this more traditional setting were studied for a\nlong time, see e.g. [11, 20, 17, 23, 24, 25, 3, 4].\nThe arrows Z2 \u2192 Z \u00d7 R \u2192 R2 have a double meaning: a continuous system can be\nconsidered as a (non-classical) symmetry of the discrete one, or alternatively it can be\nobtained by a continuous limit. The amount of papers growths exponentially at each step\ndown the diagram. We mention only the classical sources [26, 10, 21] and classification\nresults on lattice systems due to the Siberian school [27, 22, 28, 1].\nThe contents of our paper correspond to the route along the arrows in the framed\npart of the above diagram (the rest part can be found, e.g. in [6, 4]). In the main text we\ndiscuss only the non-degenerate case related to an elliptic curve. Several more simple cases\ncan be obtained without additional efforts by some specification of the general formulae,\nfor example by substituting sinh(x) or x instead of the Weierstrass function \u03c3(x). This\ncorresponds to a degeneration of an elliptic curve into a rational one. All constructions\nof the present paper remain valid under such degenerations, which constitute the list\nQ1 \u2013Q4 of integrable discrete equations on quad-graphs placed in Appendix A. Actually,\nit contains six equations, since the parameter \u03b4 in equations Q1 and Q3 can be scaled\nto either 0 or 1. This list represents the most essential part of the classification result\nobtained in [6].\n\n2\n\nDiscrete equations on quad-graphs\n\nWe start with equations\nQ(u0 , u1 , u2, u3 ; \u03b1, \u03b2) = 0\n\n(1)\n\non quad-graphs (that is, planar graphs with quadrilateral faces). Here the \"fields\" uk \u2208\nCP1 are assigned cyclically to the vertices of any face of the graph and the parameters\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C are assigned to its edges. It is required that opposite edges of any face carry one\nand the same parameter (see Fig. 1). According to [7, 18], integrability of such equation\nis synonymous with 3D consistency, see below. The most important representative of\nintegrable equations (1) is the equation Q4 , which we give here in the nice form derived\nin [18]:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nA (u0 \u2212 b)(u3 \u2212 b) \u2212 (a \u2212 b)(c \u2212 b) (u1 \u2212 b)(u2 \u2212 b) \u2212 (a \u2212 b)(c \u2212 b)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+B (u0 \u2212 a)(u1 \u2212 a) \u2212 (b \u2212 a)(c \u2212 a) (u3 \u2212 a)(u2 \u2212 a) \u2212 (b \u2212 a)(c \u2212 a)\n= ABC(a \u2212 b),\n(Q4 )\nwhere the points\n(a, A) = (\u2118(\u03b1), \u2118\u2032(\u03b1)),\n\n(b, B) = (\u2118(\u03b2), \u2118\u2032 (\u03b2)),\n\n(c, C) = (\u2118(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), \u2118\u2032(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1))\n\nbelong to the elliptic curve E = {A2 = r(a)}, and r(a) = 4a3 \u2212 g2 a \u2212 g3 is the notation\nfor the Weierstrass polynomial used throughout the paper. So, in this case it is natural\n2\n\n\fu3\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2\n\nu0\n\nu2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\nu1\n\nFig. 1: The basic quadrilateral and D4 group of symmetry\n\nto assume that the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 belong to the period parallelogram of E rather than\nto C. A collection of formulas related to E and to the corresponding Weierstrass elliptic\nfunctions is put in Appendix B.\nIt is obvious that Q4 is invariant under reflections in the diagonals: u0 \u2194 u2 , \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2\nand u1 \u2194 u3 , \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2, as well as under reflections (u0 , u3 ) \u2194 (u1 , u2) and (u0 , u1) \u2194\n(u3, u2 ), so that this equation admits the symmetry group D4 of the square.\nActually, the symmetry of Q4 is even more rich. This will follow from another form\nof this equation, which is of a fundamental importance also for many other reasons, as\nwill be shown below.\nProposition 1. Equation Q4 is equivalent, under the point transformations ui = \u2118(xi ),\nto equation\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1)/F (x0 , x3 ; \u03b2) = F (x0 , x2 ; \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2),\n(2)\nwhere\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) =\n\n\u03c3(x0 + x1 + \u03b1)\u03c3(x0 \u2212 x1 + \u03b1)\n.\n\u03c3(x0 + x1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03c3(x0 \u2212 x1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(3)\n\nThis proposition was proved in [6]. Equation (2) is called the multiplicative three-leg\nform of (1) centered at x0 . Sometimes it is more convenient to use the additive three-leg\nform\nf (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) \u2212 f (x0 , x3 ; \u03b2) = f (x0 , x2 ; \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2),\n(4)\nwhere\n\n1\nlog F (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1).\n(5)\n2\nThe functions f for equations Q1 \u2013Q3 , as well as the corresponding point transformations\nof the fields and parameters are listed in Appendix A.\nProposition 1 is checked with the help of some identities for elliptic functions listed\nin Appendix B. With the help of (B.4) one sees immediately that the function (3) is\nfractional-linear in u1 = \u2118(x1 ) (but not in u0 = \u2118(x0 )):\nf (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) =\n\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) =\n\n\u2118(x1 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 + \u03b1) \u03c3 2 (x0 + \u03b1)\n*\n.\n\u2118(x1 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 \u2212 \u03b1) \u03c3 2 (x0 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, the formula (2) yields an equation which is already affine-linear in u1 , u2, u3 ,\nbut with a complicated dependence on x0 . Some additional transformations based on\n(B.1), (B.3) are needed in order to show that this equation coincides with Q4 up to some\n3\n\n\f123\nx0\n\n31\n23\n\n3\n\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12\n\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12\n\n\u03b13\n\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13\n\nx1\n\n12\n\n1\n\n2\n\nx3\n\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\nx2\nFig. 2: S4 symmetry of discrete KN\n\n0\n\nFig. 3: 3D consistency\n\nfactor depending on x0 . Note that eq. (2) defines, strictly speaking, a correspondence,\nsince each xi is defined up to a sign and up to shifts by periods of the function \u2118(x).\nThe function F has an obvious symmetry property\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) =\n\n1\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u2212\u03b1)\n\n(7)\n\nwhich implies one of the D4 symmetries x1 \u2194 x3 , \u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2. However, another symmetry\n(x0 , x3 ) \u2194 (x1 , x2 ) of the equation Q4 becomes hidden in its three-leg form (2) centered\nat x0 . Due to this symmetry the three-leg form can be centered at an arbitrary vertex.\nOn the other hand, three-leg form exhibits one more symmetry which remains hidden\nin the rational form Q4 , namely the fact that the diagonals of the quadrilateral are on\nthe equal footing with its edges. Indeed, denote \u03b1 = \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 , \u03b2 = \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 , then eq. (2)\ntakes the form\nF (x0 , x1 ; \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )F (x0 , x2 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 )F (x0 , x3 ; \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 ) = 1.\n\n(8)\n\nThis means that the full symmetry group of discrete KN equation is not the D4 group of\nthe square on Fig. 1, but the symmetric group S4 of the tetrahedron on Fig. 2. Probably,\nthere does not exist the form of equation, in which the whole group becomes apparent.\nIndeed, even in the simplest case of equation (Q1 )\u03b4=0 (see Appendix A) which reads\nCrossRatio (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) = \u03b1/\u03b2, this full group S4 is encoded in the transformation\nproperties of the cross-ratio.\nAs the first application of the three-leg form, we will prove that it (together with the\nabove mentioned symmetry properties) implies the fundamental property of 3D consistency, which can be accepted as the definition of integrability for equations of the form\n(1). Recall [7, 18] that equation (1) is called 3D-consistent, if the following holds. For\narbitrary initial data u0 , u1 , u2, u3 , define the values u12 , u23 , u31 (the enumeration, which\nis different from the one used elsewhere in this paper, is explained on Fig. 3) according\n\n4\n\n\fto the equations\nQ(u0 , u1 , u12 , u2; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 0,\nQ(u0 , u2 , u23 , u3; \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) = 0,\nQ(u0 , u3 , u31 , u1; \u03b13 , \u03b11 ) = 0,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhich correspond to three faces of the cube adjacent to the vertex 0. Then equations\nQ(u1 , u12 , u123 , u31 ; \u03b12 , \u03b13 ) = 0,\nQ(u2 , u23 , u123 , u12 ; \u03b13 , \u03b11 ) = 0,\nQ(u3 , u31 , u123 , u23 ; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) = 0,\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\ncorresponding to the rest faces, define one and the same value u123 .\nProposition 2. Suppose that equation (1) admits the D4 symmetry group and is equivalent, under some point transformation u = \u03c6(x), a = \u03c1(\u03b1), to the three-leg equation (2).\nThen it is 3D-consistent.\nProof. It is enough to show that if u123 is defined by equation (12), then (13) is fulfilled as\nwell. Rewrite equations (9), (11), (12) (corresponding to the faces adjacent to the vertex\n1) in the three-leg forms centered at x1 (recall that this is possible due to the symmetry\nproperties):\nF (x1 , x31 ; \u03b13 )/F (x1 , x0 ; \u03b11 ) = F (x1 , x3 ; \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 ),\nF (x1 , x12 ; \u03b12 )/F (x1 , x0 ; \u03b11 ) = F (x1 , x2 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 ),\nF (x1 , x12 ; \u03b12 )/F (x1 , x31 ; \u03b13 ) = F (x1 , x123 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ).\nFrom these there follows the equation relating the fields at the vertices of the dashed\ntetrahedron on Fig. 3:\nF (x1 , x2 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 )/F (x1 , x3 ; \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 ) = F (x1 , x123 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ).\nThis is nothing but the three-leg form of the equation\nQ(u1 , u2 , u3, u123 ; \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 ) = 0,\n\n(15)\n\ncentered at x1 . This can be centered at x2 , as well, resulting in the cyclic shift of indices:\nF (x2 , x3 ; \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b12 )/F (x2 , x1 ; \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 ) = F (x2 , x123 ; \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b11 ).\nThe latter equation, together with the three-leg forms of equations (9), (10) centered at\nx2 , leads to the three-leg form of (13), as required.\n\n3\n\nDiscrete Toda systems on graphs\n\nExistence of the three-leg form allows us to establish a direct link to discrete Toda systems\non graphs introduced in [5]. This link was discovered in [7] and is described as follows.\n5\n\n\fx4\n\nx4\n\nx3\nx5\n\u03b13\nx6\nx7\n\nx2\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b14\n\n\u03b11 x\n1\nx0 \u03b15\nx9\n\nx6\n\nx10\n\nx8\n\n2\n\u03b13 \u03b1\u03b1\n1\n\u03b14 \u03b15\n\n\u03b11 x2\n\u03b12\n\nx10\nx8\n\nFig. 4: Faces adjacent to the vertex x0 .\n\nFig. 5: The black graph star of the vertex x0 .\n\nSuppose that the quad-graph \u0393 is bi-partite, i.e. its vertices can be colored black and\nwhite so that the ends of any edge are of different colors. Consider the graph \u03930 whose\nset of vertices V (\u03930 ) consists of the black vertices of \u0393, and whose edges are diagonals\nof quadrilateral faces of \u0393. Consider a vertex x0 \u2208 V (\u03930 ) (for brevity we will identify\nvertices with the field variables sitting there), and let x0 be a common vertex of n adjacent\nquadrilateral faces (x0 , x2j\u22121 , x2j , x2j+1 ) \u2208 F (\u0393), j = 1, . . . , n, like shown on Fig. 4. Then,\nmultiplying the equations of the type (2) centered in x0 for all these faces, we see that\nthe white vertices x2j\u22121 cancel out and the black vertices x2j satisfy the equation on the\nstar of the vertex x0 :\nn\nY\nF (x0 , x2j ; \u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1j+1) = 1,\n(16)\nj=1\n\nor, in the additive form,\n\nn\nX\n\nf (x0 , x2j ; \u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1j+1 ) = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nj=1\n\nThis is a discrete Toda system on the graph \u03930 . (Of course, a similar Toda type system\nholds also for the white graph \u03931 which is dual to \u03930 .) The parameters \u03b1j which were\nassigned originally to the edges (x0 , x2j\u22121 ) \u2208 E(\u0393), label now the corners of the faces\nof \u03930 . Notice that only the differences of these parameters appear in equations (17), so\nthat simultaneous shifting all the parameters of the equations on the original quad-graph\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03bb leads to the same Toda system on \u03930 . This shift plays the role of the spectral\nparameter in the zero curvature representation of the Toda system.\nAs established in [7, 18], any 3D consistent equation (1) is its own zero curvature\nrepresentation. We will show that it plays this role not only for itself, but for a whole\nset of related systems, including discrete Toda systems. For this aim, rewrite eq. Q4 on\nthe quadrilateral (u0 , u1, u2 , u3 ) \u2208 F (\u0393) as\nk0 u0 u1 u2 u3 + k1 (u1 u2 u3 + u0 u2 u3 + u0 u1 u3 + u0 u1 u2 ) + k2 (u0 u2 + u1 u3 )\n+ k3 (u0 u1 + u2 u3 ) + k4 (u0 u3 + u1 u2 ) + k5 (u0 + u1 + u2 + u3 ) + k6 = 0.\n6\n\n\f(Concrete expressions of the coefficients ki in terms of (a, A) and (b, B) can be found in\nthe original paper [2].) The field u3 is a fractional-linear function (M\u00f6bius transformation)\nof u1 with coefficients depending on u0 , u2 and \u03b11 , \u03b12 . Denote the matrix of this M\u00f6bius\ntransformation as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212k1 u0 u2 \u2212 k3 u0 \u2212 k4 u2 \u2212 k5 \u2212k2 u0 u2 \u2212 k5 (u0 + u2 ) \u2212 k6\n,\nU(u0 , u2; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) =\nk0 u0 u2 + k1 (u0 + u2 ) + k2\nk1 u 0 u 2 + k4 u 0 + k3 u 2 + k5\nD\n(18)\nwhere D is the normalizing factor such that det U = 1. Considering now n quadrilateral faces (u0 , u2j\u22121, u2j , u2j+1) \u2208 F (\u0393) adjacent to u0 , we see that, according to the\ncancellation property leading to the Toda systems, the product\nx\nY\n\nU(u0 , u2j ; \u03b1j , \u03b1j+1)\n\n1\u2264j\u2264n\n\ngenerates an identical M\u00f6bius transformation and is therefore a scalar matrix. Moreover,\nthe latter property is equivalent to the discrete Toda equation at the vertex u0 \u2208 V (\u03930 ),\nformulated now in terms of the variables (u0 , u2j ). Thus, we see that the following holds.\nProposition 3. Discrete Toda equation (16) at the vertex u0 \u2208 V (\u03930 ) is rational in\nterms of u0 and u2j , j = 1, . . . , n. The discrete Toda system on an arbitrary graph \u03930\nadmits a zero curvature representation in the sense of [5], with the transition matrices\nacross the edge (u0 , u2) \u2208 E(\u03930 ) given by U(u0 , u2; \u03b11 + \u03bb, \u03b12 + \u03bb).\nThe fact that the Toda equation for the star of the vertex u0 is rational with respect\nto u2j = \u2118(x2j ), j = 1, . . . , n, is easy to see from (16), which can be rewritten with the\nhelp of the formula (6) as\nn\nY\n\u2118(x2j ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 + \u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1j+1 ) \u03c3 2 (x0 + \u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1j+1)\n*\n= 1.\n\u2118(x2j ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 \u2212 \u03b1j + \u03b1j+1 ) \u03c3 2 (x0 \u2212 \u03b1j + \u03b1j+1)\nj=1\n\nHowever, the rationality with respect to u0 = \u2118(x0 ) remains hidden in this representation.\nThis is a new manifestation of the fact that the original (polynomial in uj ) and the threeleg forms of the equation Q4 are complementary in showing and hiding various properties.\nThe next, Lagrangian property is better visible again in the variables x, with the help\nof the three-leg form. It is easy to see that the function \u2202f (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1)/\u2202x1 is symmetric\nwith respect to the flip x0 \u2194 x1 . Integrating this function with respect to x0 and x1 , we\nsee that there exists a symmetric function \u039b(x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) = \u039b(x1 , x0 ; \u03b1), such that\nf (x0 , x1 ; \u03b1) = \u2202\u039b(x0 , x1 ; \u03b1)/\u2202x0 .\nProposition 4. Let E(\u03930 ) be the set of the edges of the black graph \u03930 . Let the pairs\nof parameters be assigned to the edges from E(\u03930 ) according to Fig. 5, so that, e.g., the\npair (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) corresponds to the edge (x0 , x2 ). Then the discrete Toda equations (17) are\nEuler\u2013Lagrange equations for the action functional\nX\nS=\n\u039b(x0 , x2 ; \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 ).\n(x0 ,x2 )\u2208E(\u03930 )\n\n7\n\n\fFinally, we give the matrix formulation for the cancellation phenomenon which is the\nmain feature of the three-leg form.\nLemma 5.

According to (6), the formula (19) is equivalent to:\n\u2118(x3 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 + \u03b2) \u03c3 2 (x0 + \u03b2)\n\u2118(x1 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 + \u03b1) \u03c3 2 (x0 + \u03b1) \u22122q\n* 2\n=\n*\n*e .\n\u2118(x3 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 \u2212 \u03b2) \u03c3 (x0 \u2212 \u03b2)\n\u2118(x1 ) \u2212 \u2118(x0 \u2212 \u03b1) \u03c3 2 (x0 \u2212 \u03b1)\nNow it is a matter of a straightforward computation to represent this as the M\u00f6bius\ntransformation from \u2118(x1 ) to \u2118(x3 ) with the matrix L given by (20), (21).\nOf course, matrix L is defined only up to a scalar factor, which is chosen in (20), (21)\nso that det L = \u03c3(2\u03b1)\u03c3(2\u03b2) = const. The telescopic cancellation taking place by adding\nseveral equations of the type (19), is translated for the matrices L into the following\nproperty: if, additionally to (20), we have\nL1 = eq1 N(x0 ; \u03b3, \u03b2) \u2212 e\u2212q1 N(x0 ; \u2212\u03b3, \u2212\u03b2),\nthen\n\n\u0001\nL1 L = \u03c3(2\u03b2) eq1 +q N(x0 ; \u03b3, \u03b1) \u2212 e\u2212q1 \u2212q N(x0 ; \u2212\u03b3, \u2212\u03b1) .\n\nThis follows easily from the properties of the rank 1 matrices N, namely:\nN(x; \u03b3, \u03b2)N(x; \u03b2, \u03b1) = \u03c3(2\u03b2)N(x; \u03b3, \u03b1),\n\nN(x; \u03b3, \u03b2)N(x; \u2212\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1) = 0.\n\nNotice that the case q = f (x0 , x2 ; \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) in eq. (19) corresponds to the additive\nthree-leg form (4) of equation Q4 . In this case we obtain from Lemma 5 a new formula\nfor the transition matrices from Proposition 3:\nU(u0 , u2 ; \u03b11 , \u03b12 ) \u223c ef (x0 ,x2 ;\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) N(x0 ; \u03b12 , \u03b11 ) \u2212 e\u2212f (x0 ,x2 ;\u03b11 \u2212\u03b12 ) N(x0 ; \u2212\u03b12 , \u2212\u03b11 ),\nwhere symbol \u223c means equality up to a constant scalar factor. A direct verification of\nthis formula is actually equivalent to a proof of Proposition 1.\n\n8\n\n\f4\n\nLagrangian systems with discrete time\nand space-time slicing of regular lattices\n\nNow we consider the specification of the general scheme corresponding to the case of the\nshift-invariant graphs, or lattices. Recall the general construction of the discrete time\nLagrangian mechanics [16]. Let X be a vector space (the theory can be developed also\nin a more general setting, when X is a manifold, but we will not need this here). Let\nL : X \u00d7 X 7\u2192 R be a smooth function, called the discrete time Lagrange function. For\nan arbitrary sequence X : \u03b5Z \u2283 {a\u03b5, a\u03b5 + \u03b5, . . . , b\u03b5} 7\u2192 X one considers the discrete time\naction functional\nb\u22121\nX\nS=\nL(X(n\u03b5), X(n\u03b5 + \u03b5)).\nn=a\n\nThe sequences serving as critical points of the action functional (in the class of variations\npreserving X(a\u03b5) and X(b\u03b5)) satisfy the discrete time Euler-Lagrange equation, which we\nshall write in the index-free form as\ne\n\u2202L(X, X)/\u2202X\n+ \u2202L( X , X)/\u2202X = 0\n(22)\ne\ne stand for X(n\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5), X(n\u03b5), X(n\u03b5 + \u03b5), respectively.

(22). It defines a multi-valued\ne Pe) on T \u2217 X . More precisely, the first equation in (23) is an implicit\nmap (X, P ) 7\u2192 (X,\ne while the second one allows one to calculate Pe explicitly and uniquely,\nequation for X,\ne are known. The fundamental property of this multi-valued map is the\nonce X and X\nfollowing: each branch of the map T \u2217 X 7\u2192 T \u2217 X defined by (23) is symplectic with respect\nto the standard symplectic structure on T \u2217 X .\nThe continuous limit of this construction is as follows. Suppose that X(n\u03b5) approximates the smooth function X(t) at t = n\u03b5 with some small \u03b5 > 0. Suppose that by the\ne = (X, X + \u03b5\u1e8a + o(\u03b5)) there holds an asymptotic relation:\nsubstitution (X, X)\ne \u2248 \u03b5L(X, \u1e8a)\nL(X, X)\n\nwith some smooth function L : T X 7\u2192 R, where the sign \u2248 means equality up to additive\nterms o(\u03b5). Then we have:\ne\ne = Pe,\n\u2202L/\u2202 \u1e8a \u2248 \u2202L(X, X)/\u2202\nX\n\u0001\ne\ne\ne = \u03b5\u22121 (Pe \u2212 P ).\n\u2202L/\u2202X \u2248 \u03b5\u22121 \u2202L(X, X)/\u2202X\n+ \u2202L(X, X)/\u2202\nX\n9\n\n\fx\ne\u22121\nx\u22121\n\nx\ne\nx\n\nx1\n\nx\nx1\ne\ne\nFig. 6: Slice (4 + 2) on triangular lattice\nThus, the discrete Lagrangian equations (23) approximate (serve as a discretization of)\nthe continuous Euler\u2013Lagrange equations with the Lagrangian L(X, \u1e8a):\nP = \u2202L(X, \u1e8a)/\u2202 \u1e8a,\n\n\u1e56 = \u2202L(X, \u1e8a)/\u2202X.\n\nNow we can introduce the discrete time Lagrangian formalism for discrete Toda systems on some regular two-dimensional lattices. We will consider planar graphs \u0393 with\nthe set of vertices V (\u0393) = Z2 only. They will be distinguished by their sets of edges\nE(\u0393). It will be convenient to think of the vertices (k, n) \u2208 Z2 as representing the points\n(k, n\u03b5) \u2208 R2 with some (small) \u03b5 > 0. The first index k will enumerate the lattice sites,\nwhile the second index n has the meaning of the discrete\ntime t = n\u03b5. For a fixed t = n\u03b5,\nS\nt\nwe will write V = {(k, t) : k \u2208 Z}, so that V (\u0393) = t\u2208\u03b5Z V t .\nA slicing of a graph \u0393 consists in choosingSsubgraphs \u0393t so that V (\u0393t ) = V t\u2212\u03b5 \u222a V t ,\nthe sets E(\u0393t ) = E t are disjoint, and E(\u0393) = t\u2208\u03b5Z E t .\nThe configuration space of our discrete time systems is X = {X : Z 7\u2192 R} consisting\nof real-valued sequences X = (xk )k\u2208Z . An element P \u2208 TX\u2217 X is a sequence P = (pk )k\u2208Z .\nClearly, for any fixed t = n\u03b5, the set of functions on V t is identified with X . Functions on\nV (\u0393t ) are naturally identified with pairs of functions ( X , X) on V t\u2212\u03b5 and V t , respectively,\ne functions for our Toda systems\nand therefore belong to X \u00d7X . The discrete time Lagrange\nare of the form\nX\nL( X , X) =\n\u039b(x, x\u2032 ; \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2),\ne\n(x,x\u2032 )\u2208E t\ni.e. are obtained by summing up the elementary Lagrangians over the edges of one slice\nof the graph \u0393.\nThe pictures of the slicing for the graphs playing the main roles in our subsequent\npresentation are given below. Starting from this point, we use the following abbreviated\nnotation for the sequences like (xk )k\u2208Z: we write x, x\u00b11 for xk , xk\u00b11 , respectively. This\nnotation has not to be confused with indices used in the previous section.\nThe central role in what follows will play the discrete Toda system on the triangular\nlattice and on the square lattice. All vertices of the regular triangular lattice have valence\n6, so that the corresponding Toda system is a 7-point scheme. Similarly, the Toda system\non the regular square lattice is a 5-point scheme. The Hamiltonian properties of these\nsystems depend essentially on the slicing chosen. For the triangular lattice we will choose\ne is defined implicitly,\nthe slicing on Fig. 6. The corresponding map ( X , X) 7\u2192 (X, X)\ne\n10\n\n\fsince each equation contains two fields x\ne and x\ne\u22121 from the time level t = n\u03b5 + \u03b5). For the\nregular square lattice we will use two different slicings. The first one is shown on Fig. 7\nin a somewhat unusual way (by a standard drawing the slice would run diagonally). It\ncorresponds to an implicit discrete Toda system. Indeed, also in this case each equation\ncontains two fields x\ne and x\ne\u22121 from the time level t = n\u03b5 + \u03b5. Finally, the slicing shown on\nFig. 8 represents an explicit discrete Toda system, since each equation contains only one\nupdated field x\ne. These two types of 5-point equations can be obtained from the 7-point\none by reduction consisting in erasing some edges of the triangular lattice.\nx\ne\u22121\n\nx\ne\n\nx\ne\nx\u22121\n\nx\n\nx1\n\nx\ne\n\nx\nx1\ne\ne\nFig. 7: Slice (2 + 2) on square lattice\n\n5\n\nx\n\nFig. 8: Slice (3 + 1) on square lattice\n\nTriangular lattice\n\nTime discretizations of lattices of the Ruijsenaars\u2013Toda type [21] were introduced in\n[23, 24]. They were identified in [3] as discrete systems on the regular triangular lattice.\nThe regular triangular lattice T can be considered as the black subgraph of the quadgraph known as the dual kagome lattice (drawn on Fig. 9 in dashed lines). The latter graph\nhas vertices of two kinds, black vertices of valence 6 and white vertices of valence 3, and\nedges of three types, all edges of each type being parallel.

Consider the full system of the equations (1) on the dual kagome lattice and denote\nthe vertices of the white sublattice as shown on the Fig. 9. The auxiliary linear problem\n\u03a81 = L\u03a8 corresponds to crossing two edges (x, x) and (x, x1 ). Adding the three-leg\nequations on the quadrilaterals (x, \u03a8, x, \u03a61 ) and e\n(x, \u03a61 , x1 , \u03a8e1 ), and using the formula\ne\ne\n(28) we find:\n\nf (x, \u03a8; \u03bb) \u2212 f (x, \u03a81 ; \u03bb \u2212 \u03b2) = f (x, x; \u03b5) + f (x, x1 ; \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5) = p.\n(34)\ne\ne\ne = V \u03a8 corresponds to crossing two edges (x, x\u22121 )\nSimilarly, the auxiliary linear problem \u03a8\ne x\ne\nand (x, x\ne\u22121 ).

Now Lemma 5 applied to (34), (35), yields the formulas (30),\n(32), respectively.\n\nOf course, in the Hamiltonian framework the main role in the zero curvature representation belongs to Q\nL, the transition matrix along the lattice. For instance, the so-called\nmonodromy matrix k L(xk , pk , \u03b2k ; \u03bb) is a generating function of integrals of motion. In\nthis context it is important that Lk is local, i.e. depends on one pair of canonically conjugate variables xk , pk only. As for the matrix V , it specifies just one (discrete) flow of\nthe hierarchy. In the next section we will present another (continuous) commuting flow.\n\n6\n\nElliptic Ruijsenaars\u2013Toda lattice\n\nThe Lagrangian (25) has a well defined limit at \u03b5 \u2192 0, in the sense that L(X, X + \u03b5\u1e8a) \u2248\n\u03b5L(X, \u1e8a).

Therefore the flow (36), (37) shares the matrix L\nwith the map (27), (28). In other words, the latter is a B\u00e4cklund transformation of the\nformer.\nProposition 7.

Define a function y : V (T ) 7\u2192 C by equations\nF (x, x; \u03b5) = F (x, y; \u03b2)/F (x, x1 ; \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5).\ne\ne\nThen also the following equations hold:\n\nF (y, ye; \u03b5) = F (y, x; \u03b2)/F (y, e\ny\u22121; \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b5).\n\nMoreover, y is also a solution of the discrete Toda system (26).\n14\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\n\fx\ne\u22121\n\nx\u22121\n\nx\ne\n\nye\u22121\n\nx\n\nye\n\nx1\n\ny\nx\nx1\ne\ne\nFig. 10: Map x 7\u2192 y\nThe geometric description of equation (41) is the following: the variables y should be\nthought of as defined on the vertices of the new copy of triangular lattice which correspond\nto the half of the faces of the original one, namely those shaded on the Fig. 10 (so, y sits\non vertex dual to the triangle (x, x, x1 )). Then equation (42) reflects the fact that the\nvariables x are attached to the halfeofethe faces of the y-lattice. Moreover, equations (41),\n(42) are nothing but the three-leg forms (8) of the basic equation Q4 for the tetrahedra\n(x, x, x1 , y) and (y, ye, ye\u22121, x). In terms of u = \u2118(x), v = \u2118(y), the equations (41), (42)\ne e\nread:\nQ(u, u, u1 , v; \u03b5, \u03b2) = 0, Q(v, e\nv, e\nv\u22121 , u; \u03b5, \u03b2) = 0.\ne e\nProof. Consider the system on the cubic lattice Z3 = {(i1 , i2 , i3 )} consisting of equation\nQ4 on each square face, with the parameters \u03b1m attached to the edges of the direction\nim . This is possible due to the 3D consistency of equation Q4 established in Proposition\n2. Vertices of the x- and y-lattices can be interpreted as the points of the cubic lattice\nlying in the planes i1 + i2 + i3 = 0 and i1 + i2 + i3 = 2, respectively, see Fig. 11. Due to the\nthree-leg property, both fields x and y satisfy the discrete Toda system (26). Equations\n(41), (42) are nothing but the tetrahedron equations (15) for the corresponding cubes.\nConversely, it is easy to see that, given a solution x of (26), one reconstructs uniquely\nthe black sublattice of the cubic lattice, and then an arbitrary value at one white vertex\ndetermines the white sublattice uniquely.\nSo, equations (41), (42) can be considered as a sort of B\u00e4cklund transformation x 7\u2192 y\nof the discrete Toda system (26). On the other hand, they can be considered as a\ndiscrete time system (mapping) ( X , Y ) 7\u2192 (X, Ye ), where X = (xk )k\u2208Z , Y = (yk )k\u2208Z . In\nthis interpretation, this mapping eserves as discretization of the Shabat-Yamilov lattice\nconsidered in the next section.\nProposition 9.

This can be achieved by setting \u03b12 = \u03b13 . For\nour particular setting (24) this means that all parameters of the Toda lattice are equal:\n\u03b2k = \u03b5. The parameters of the corresponding quad-graph (finer square lattice shown by\ndashes on Fig. 14) are \u03b11 = \u03bb, \u03b12 = \u03bb \u2212 \u03b5.\n19\n\n\fx\ne\u22121\n\ne\n\u03a8\n\nx\ne\n\u03b12\nx\n\nx\u22121\n\u03a8\n\nx\u22121\ne\n\ne1\n\u03a8\n\nx\ne1\n\n\u03b11\n\nx1\n\u03a81\n\nx\ne\n\nx1\ne\n\nFig. 14: Fields and wave functions on a square lattice\n\nCorrespondingly, the results on the discrete Toda system on the square lattice are\nobtained from the results of Sect. 5 by putting \u03b2 = \u03b5.
