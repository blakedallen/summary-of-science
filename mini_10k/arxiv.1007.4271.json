Apart from the purely\nelectronic contributions, other degrees of freedom such\nas vibrational modes or local spins can be addressed and\nrevealed by point-contact spectroscopy3 (PCS) or by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS).4 These\ntechniques have been extensively used in the recent past\nto reveal inelastic features in the non-linear conductance\ndue to vibrations5\u201312 or local spin excitations,13\u201315 triggering an intense theoretical activity. So far most studies focused on the current-voltage characteristics, and\npresent day PCS/IETS theories,16\u201331 often based on abinitio calculations, allow to make detailed predictions for\nthe conductance that compare favorably with experimental results.\nElectronic current (shot) noise32,33 is another quantity of fundamental interest in transport, representing\nthe second cumulant of the current distribution within\nthe full counting statistics methodology.34 Although the\nmeasurement of higher order cumulants is experimentally\nchallenging, shot noise in atomic contacts and molecular\njunctions has been already measured in the small voltage\n(elastic) regime,35\u201337 and there are ongoing experimental efforts to address the inelastic noise signal as well.38\nThese progresses made the investigation of effects due to\nelectron-phonon (e-ph) interaction on the current noise\nan appealing task from the theoretical point of view, with\nthe ultimate goal of allowing for prediction for the noise\n\nin molecular junctions as reliable as those now available\nfor the non-linear conductance.\nSince the noise is technically represented by a twoparticle non-equilibrium correlation function, its direct\nevaluation poses a significant challenge compared to the\nmean current. For molecular junctions weakly coupled to\nleads, noise calculations based on one-level models have\nbeen put forward within the rate equation approach.39,40\nIn the opposite limit, pioneering works based on the nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism41,42 adopted a\nmean-field-like approximation for the noise, thus neglecting the contributions due to the vertex corrections. A\nvery convenient tool to overcome these limitations is the\nfull counting statistics,34,43 since it allows to address the\nnoise and other current cumulants, while taking consistently into account all contributions due to e-ph coupling\nup to a given order in perturbation theory. Simultaneously with other two groups,44,45 we exploited such an\napproach to analyze the transport properties of a simple\nmodel for molecular junctions consisting of a single resonant level symmetrically coupled to metallic leads and\nweakly interacting with a single phonon mode.46 Despite\nits simplicity, this model can be applied to the experimentally relevant case of junctions formed by a single\nhydrogen/deuterium molecule between platinum leads,7\nand in this case we predicted a significant inelastic contribution to the current noise.46\nIn this paper we go beyond such a simple model and we\nextend our theory for inelastic noise46 to more complex\nmolecular junctions and to atomic wires. In fact, we consider the case of a junction formed by multiple electronic\nlevels with asymmetric coupling to leads, and derive analytical formulas for the corrections to current and noise\ndue to weak electron-phonon coupling. We express our\nresult in terms of universal temperature- and voltagedependent functions and junction-dependent prefactors.\n\n\f2\nThese expressions, when supplemented with ab-initio calculations to estimate microscopically the prefactors characterizing a given junction, can serve as a basis to make\nrealistic predictions for the current noise in a relevant\nclass of molecular and atomic-size junctions. In this respect, our work can be viewed as a direct extension of\nthe corresponding lowest order expansion scheme developed for the non-linear conductance.18\u201320 In addition, we\nidentify the contributions to noise due to the vertex corrections and show that, even in limit of weak e-ph coupling, they need to be taken into account in order to obtain accurate results and to comply with the fluctuationdissipation theorem.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After a brief description of the model of a multi-level junction coupled\nto leads and weakly interacting with a number of vibronic\nmodes (phonons) in Sec. II, we introduce the methodology of the noise calculation via extended Keldysh Green's\nfunctions in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we consider the case of\nno interactions and recover the standard results for the\nelastic current and noise. Our original contribution is\npresented in Secs. V and VI, where we discuss the corrections to the current and noise due to the Hartree and\nthe Fock diagrams, respectively. In subsection VI C we\nthen illustrate our theory by a simple example of independent electronic levels which are coupled only via the e-ph\ninteraction. Finally, we conclude and give an outlook of\nopen issues and possible extensions of the present work\nin Sec. VII. More technical parts of the text are deferred\nto 5 appendices. In addition, we make use of the Electronic Physics Auxiliary Publication Service (EPAPS) to\nsupplement the paper with a Mathematica notebook with\nfull expressions for the lowest order corrections to current\nand noise due to e-ph coupling.

This implies that both mean\ncurrent and zero-frequency noise are constant throughout the whole circuit, in particular at both junctions between the device and the leads. Potential violations of\ncharge conservation can only occur in the next order, i.e.\nO(M 4 ), and can thus be safely neglected for any practical\npurposes in the considered weak coupling limit.\nFinally, we observe that to the lowest order in the eph coupling, Ieph and Seph are simply given by a linear superposition of contributions coming from different\nphonon modes. As a consequence, we can restrict ourselves to the case of coupling to a single phonon mode\nwith frequency \u03c90 , occupation N0 \u2261 (e\u03b2~\u03c90 \u2212 1)\u22121 and\ncoupling matrix M.\n\nD.\n\nThe extended wide band limit\n\nThe corrections to current (25) and noise (26) due\nto the e-ph coupling involve energy integrals which can\nbe evaluated in general only numerically. Analytical\nprogress can still be made if one assumes the electronic\nstructure to be slowly changing over few multiples of\na typical phonon energy around the Fermi level EF\nand approximate (i) the level broadening \u0393\u03b1 and (ii)\nthe non-interacting retarded/advanced Green's function\ngr(a) with their values at the Fermi energy18\u201320,23\n\u0393\u03b1 (\u03b5) \u2248 \u0393\u03b1 (EF ) \u2261 \u0393\u03b1 ,\n\ngr(a) (\u03b5) \u2248 gr(a) (EF ) \u2261 gr(a) ,\n\u2212+(+\u2212)\n\n\u2212\u2212\nwhere we took gr(a) \u2261 g\u03bb=0\n\u2212 g\u03bb=0\nas the definir(a)\ntion of g\n. This approximation, which we call \"extended wide-band limit\" (eWBL), is reasonable for systems where either the broadening due to tunneling is\nlarge (\u0393 \u226b eV, kB T , and ~\u03c90 ), or the closest reso-\n\nnance energy \u03b5res is far away from the Fermi energy\n(|\u03b5res \u2212 EF | \u226b \u0393, eV, kB T , and ~\u03c90 ).\nWithin the eWBL approximation, the integration over\nenergy of functions with compact support can be performed analytically, resulting in explicit results for the\nmean current and the noise as functions of the applied\nbias voltage and other system parameters. It should be\nnoted however, that approximation (ii) potentially leads\nto problems for integrals over infinite range and, in this\ncase, it might be necessary to lift it. Specifically, this\nhappens in the calculation of the electron density entering the Hartree term, see Appendix B, and in the evaluation of the real parts of the retarded/advanced Fock\nself-energy via Kramers-Kronig relations, see Appendix\nC.\n\nIV.\n\nELASTIC CURRENT AND NOISE\n\nFor sake of completeness, before discussing the corrections to I and S due to the e-ph coupling, we consider\nbriefly the results for the elastic current and noise.\nIn the eWBL approximation, the elastic current is simply proportional to the voltage\nIel =\n\ne\nTr{T}eV,\nh\n\n(27)\n\nwith T = \u0393L gr \u0393R ga , while the noise is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\ne2 2\n2\nTr{T } + Tr{T(1 \u2212 T)}U (eV ) ,\nSel =\nh \u03b2\n\n(28)\n\nwhere we have introduced the function U (x) =\nx coth(\u03b2x/2).\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix T give the \"PIN-code\"\nof transmission eigen-channels of the molecule connected\nto leads (without e-ph interaction), and Eqs. (27),\n(28) are indeed equivalent51 to the standard results for\ncurrent and noise in a non-interacting system derived\nwithin the scattering theory.33,52 However, T is not\nequal to the matrix product tt\u2020 of the transmission\namplitudes t of the scattering theory (it cannot be\nas T is in general non-hermitian, for example). The\ntwo matrices are related though by a similarity (nonunitary) transformation, which among others ensures\nTr{T} = Tr{tt\u2020 }.51 With this caveat in mind, for sake\nof simplicity we will nevertheless call T the transmission\nmatrix in the rest of this paper. The construction of\nthe scattering eigenstates within the NGF formalism is\ndescribed in detail in Ref. 53.\nWe now turn our attention to the corrections to the\ncurrent and noise induced by the e-ph interaction. In\norder to make the discussion as clear as possible, we will\nconsider the contributions coming from the Hartree and\nthe Fock diagrams separately.\n\n\f6\n\uf8ee\n\n(mf)\n\nSH\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n=\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n+2\n\n(vc)\n\nSH\n\n\u03bb=0\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n=\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n(mf)\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n\u03bb=0\n\n(vc)\n\nFIG. 3.

Finally, the dot\nrepresents the e-ph coupling constant M.\nV.\n\nCORRECTIONS DUE TO THE HARTREE\nDIAGRAM\nA.\n\nCurrent\n\nWe start by considering the contributions to the current IH coming from the Hartree diagram. After integrating Eq. (25) in the eWBL approximation we obtain\ne\n(qel)\nIH = Tr{TH }eV,\n(29)\nh\nwith\n(qel)\nTH\n\n2Tr{ne M}\n=\u2212\n\u0393L (gr MAR + h.c.)\n~\u03c90\n\n(30)\n\nwith ne the noninteracting electron density [ Eq. (22)]\nand A\u03b1 = gr \u0393\u03b1 ga . The correction IH is therefore a\nsmooth function of the voltage with no features at the\nphonon emission threshold. For this reason IH has been\noften discarded in previous works on the effects of e-ph\ninteraction on the current.17\u201320,23,26,42,54\nIt should be noticed, however, that IH is generally nonlinear in eV , since ne can be a (smooth) function of the\napplied bias voltage. Such a voltage dependence is nevertheless rather weak in the eWBL (see Appendix B),\nand in such a case it is possible to interpret Eq. (29) as a\nquasi-elastic correction to an effective transmission ma(qel)\ntrix T\u0303 = T + TH , i.e. because of the e-ph coupling,\nthe current is not proportional to the bare transmission\ncoefficient Tr{T} but rather to Tr{T\u0303}.\nB.\n\nNoise\n\nThe mean-field contributions and the vertex correction\nto noise due to the Hartree diagram can be schematically\nrepresented by the diagrams in Fig. 3, which are the result of inserting the Hartree self-energy from Fig. 1 into\n(mf)\nappropriate diagrams in Fig. 2.

This can be seen easily, as Eq. (31) corresponds\nexactly to the contribution of order M2 to the elastic\nshot-noise of a system with transmission matrix T\u0303:\nh\n2\nTr{T\u03032 } + Tr{T\u0303(1 \u2212 T\u0303)}U (eV ) = 2 Sel +\n\u03b2\ne\n4\n(qel)\n(qel)\n+ Tr{(1 \u2212 2T)TH }U (eV ) + Tr{TTH } + O(M4 ),\n\u03b2\nwhere Sel is given in Eq.

Contrary to SH , Eq. (32) has no\nsimple interpretation in terms of an effective transmission\ncoefficient and it represents a distinctive contribution to\nnoise coming from the Hartree term. From the physical\npoint of view, it stems from the coupling of occupations\nof the electronic levels with the current fluctuations.49,56\nWe note, however, that Im[Tr{Mn\u2032\u2212 }] = 0 in the case\nof a system with a single electronic level symmetrically\ncoupled to leads. Therefore in this particular case the\ncorrection to noise induced by the Hartree term is given\n(mf)\nby SH alone.\n\nVI.\n\nCORRECTIONS DUE TO THE FOCK\nDIAGRAM\nA.\n\nCurrent\n\nWe now turn our attention to the corrections to current\ninduced by the Fock diagram.

Eq. (33) is in agreement with\nthe result of Viljas et al.,19 while a term \u221d (1 +\n(qel)\n2N0 )Tr{TF }eV is missing in Refs. 18 and 23. Such\na discrepancy is further discussed in Appendix C.\nThe functions g(eV ) and h(eV ) give contributions to\ndI/dV which are even/odd in bias, respectively (see\nFig. 4). The term proportional to h(eV ) vanishes in the\ncase of symmetric coupling to the leads, and it is typically much smaller than the contribution proportional\nto g(eV ), even for asymmetric junctions.23,26 Moreover,\nexperimentally measured conductance curves are usually very weakly asymmetric under reversal of V and\nat present it is unclear if the asymmetry is caused by\nphonons or by other effects.\nAt low temperature (kB T \u226a ~\u03c90 , N0 \u2248 0), the main\ncontribution to IF is therefore given by the first two\nterms of Eq. (33) alone. The first of these terms, linear in eV , is a quasi-elastic correction that, similarly\nto IH , contributes to an effective transmission matrix\n(qel)\nT\u0303 = T + TF . The second one has instead a threshold\nbehavior at the phonon emission energy, see Fig. 4, and it\nis responsible for the jump in the conductance observed\nin IETS and PCS experiments.\nThe sign of the conductance step at the phonon emission threshold (positive or negative) depends on the coef(inel)\nficient Tr{TF }, and it has been discussed in detail in\n\n-1.0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\neV /~\u03c90\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4.

As a rule of thumb, in the case of a molecular junction with low (high) bare transmission Tr{T},\ninelastic e-ph scattering results in an increase (decrease)\nof the conductance above the phonon emission threshold.\nIn the case of a system with a single electronic level\nsymmetrically coupled to the leads via \u0393L = \u0393R \u2261 \u0393,\n(inel)\n(inel)\n= (M 2 T 2 /\u03932 )(1 \u2212 2T ), where\nreduces to TF\nTF\n2 r 2\nT = \u0393 |g | is the transmission coefficient. In this case,\nthe crossover from an increase to a decrease in the conductance is predicted to occur at T = 1/2.18,20 This behavior has been explored and confirmed experimentally\nin Ref. 9.\nB.\n\nNoise\n\nWe finally address the corrections to noise due to the\n(mf)\n(vc)\nFock diagram SF = SF +SF , which are schematically\nrepresented by the diagrams in Fig. 5.\nAfter lengthy but straightforward calculations, integration over energy in the usual eWBL approximation\n(mf/vc)\nleads to analytic results for SF\nas functions of the\napplied bias voltage.

Above the phonon emission threshold, |eV | > ~\u03c90 ,\ninelastic processes come into play and their contribution\nto the noise is given both by the second term of Eq. (37)\nand by the vertex correction Eq. (38). It is important to\nnotice that these two contributions are in general of the\nsame order (see below the Sec. VI C for a demonstrative\nexample), so that the latter cannot be discarded.\n\u2202S\nExperimentally, \u2202V\nis often measured directly by a\nlock-in technique. Such a quantity shows at the phonon\nemission threshold a sharp and distinguishable jump on\ntop of a featureless background due to the elastic and\nquasi-elastic contributions. Therefore, we define here the\ninelastic noise signal as the difference of the plateau values of the noise derivative just above and below the jump\n\n(41)\n\nis the zero temperature limit of Eq. (36). The cor(mf/vc)\nrections to noise SF\ncan then be divided into a\nsymmetric term, which is even in bias, and an antisymmetric one, which contains the Hilbert transform\nh(eV ) T =0 and yields an odd contribution. We notice\nthat, while h(eV ) T =0 is a continuous function, its derivative shows logarithmic divergencies at eV = \u00b1~\u03c90 .58,59\nThese zero-temperature divergencies are, however, an artifact of treating the phonons as non-interacting modes,\nand they are regularized either by finite temperature or\nif any broadening of the phonon spectrum is taken into\naccount.58,59 This issue, however, goes beyond the scope\nof this work.\nAt zero temperature, the symmetric contribution to\nSF is a piece-wise linear function of eV . At low voltages,\n|eV | < ~\u03c90 , it is given by the first term of Eq. (37) alone.\nFollowing the same reasoning as for Eq. (31), this linear\ncontribution can be directly interpreted in terms of the\n\nC.\n\nIndependent electronic levels\n\nWe now consider a toy model for molecular junctions,\nin which we assume the electronic levels to be mutually\ncoupled only via the e-ph interaction. In this case, the\nrelevant matrices in the system electronic space are given\nby\n[\u0393L(R) ]ij = \u03b4ij \u0393i,L(R) ,\n\n[gr ]ij =\n\n\u03b4ij\n,\n\u2206i + i(\u0393i,L + \u0393i,R )/2\n\nand [M]ij = Mij , where i, j = 1, . . . , N , and N is the\nnumber of electronic levels involved in the transport. Under the further assumption that each channel is symmetrically coupled to the leads (\u0393L = \u0393R = \u0393), the prefac(mf/vc)\ntors Tr{K1\n} vanish identically and Eqs.

For N = 1, Eqs. (44)\nreduce directly to the result of Refs. 44\u201346. The volt(mf)\n(vc)\nage dependence of SF\nand SF is presented in Fig. 6\nfor the case of a systems with only two levels. We no(vc)\ntice that SF < 0 (see also Eq.44b), meaning that the\nvertex corrections correspond to processes that lead to a\nPSfrag replacements\nsuppression of the noise through the system. Moreover,\nFig. 6 evidences that the contributions to the noise due to\nthe vertex corrections can be of the same order of magnitude as the mean-field ones, and that they generally\nneed to be taken into account in order to make accurate\npredictions for the phonon-assisted current noise.\nIn terms of the transmission coefficients of the different\nFIG.\nchannels, the inelastic noise signal \u2206S \u2032 is given by\nN\nX\ne3 X \b\n\u03b3ij \u03c6(Ti , Tj ) .\n\u2206S =\n\u03b3ii (1 \u2212 8Ti + 8Ti2 ) +\nh i=1\nj>i\n\u2032\n\n(45)\n\n\u0002\nwith \u03c6(Ti , Tj ) = 2 (1 \u2212 Ti \u2212 Tj )2 \u2212 Ti (1 \u2212 Ti ) \u2212 Tj (1 \u2212\np\n\u0003\nTj ) \u2212 2 Ti Tj (1 \u2212 Ti )(1 \u2212 Tj ) . Depending on the values\nof Ti and \u03b3ij , \u2206S \u2032 can be either positive or negative and\nit is in general very sensitive to the parameters of the\njunction as illustrated in Fig. 7, again for the case of a\nsystem with only two levels. Here we plot \u2206S \u2032 as a function of the transmission coefficients T1 , T2 for different\nvalues of the e-ph coupling matrix elements. As general features we notice that \u2206S \u2032 is always positive when\nT1 , T2 \u226a 1 or when they are both close to the full transmission. Vice versa, \u2206S \u2032 is always negative and close\nto maximum suppression for T1 , T2 \u2248 0.5. Interestingly,\nthe characteristics of \u2206S \u2032 depend strongly on the relative strength of the different matrix elements Mij , and\ntherefore the inelastic noise signal might provide a tool\nto extract important information on the e-ph coupling.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn conclusion, in this work we have studied the corrections due to weak electron-phonon coupling to the average current and the zero-frequency noise in a molecular\n\n(44b)\n\n0.3\n0.0\nM22 = M12 = M11\n\n-0.3\n0.4\n\nM22 = M11 , M12 = 0\nM12 = M11 , M22 = 0\n\nT1 = 0.4, T2 = 0.2\n\n0.0\n-0.4\n-0.8\n-1.2\n0\n\nT1 = 0.9, T2 = 0.8\n\n1\neV /~\u03c90\n\n2\n\n(mf)\n\n6.

Importantly, for the noise we were\nable to identify distinct terms representing the mean-field\ncontribution and the vertex corrections, respectively. We\nincluded in our calculations both the contributions due to\nthe Hartree and to the Fock diagrams and, under the assumption that the densities of states of the system and of\nthe leads depend weakly on energy (eWBL), we derived\nanalytic expressions for IH(F ) and SH(F ) as functions of\nthe applied bias voltage at arbitrary temperature. These\nexpressions can serve as a basis for ab-initio calculations\nto make realistic predictions for the current noise in an\nexperimentally significant class of molecular junctions.\nFinally, we considered a toy model for molecular junctions to elucidate the sensitivity of the inelastic phonon\nsignal to the parameters characterizing the junction.\nThroughout this paper we have assumed the phonon\nmode to be at equilibrium with an external thermal bath,\ni.e. we have taken the occupation N0 to be fixed according to the Bose-Einstein distribution N0 = (e\u03b2~\u03c90 \u2212 1)\u22121 .\nSuch an approximation is strictly consistent with the\n\n\fT2\n\n[ e3 |M11 |2 /h\u03932 ]\n\n[ e3 |M11 |2 /h\u03932 ]\n\n10\n\nT2\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nT2\n\nc)\n\n[ e3 |M12 |2 /h\u03932 ]\n\nT1\n\n[ e3 |M11 |2 /h\u03932 ]\n\nT1\n\nT2\n\nd)\n\nT1\n\nT1\n\nFIG. 7.

However, it turns out in practice that often heating effects cannot be disregarded and that they\ninfluence in turn the non-linear conductance.17,19,23,39\nFrom the theoretical point of view, the problem of nonequilibrium phonon heating can be addressed by extending the system Hamiltonian to include the coupling of the\nmolecular phonon to other degrees of freedom (typically\nbulk phonons in the leads). The value of the corresponding coupling constants can ultimately be obtained from\nab-initio calculations, which allow to asses the influence\nof the environment from a microscopical description.60\nIn the case of zero counting field \u03bb = 0, the nonequilibrium phonon occupation for weak e-ph coupling\ncan be equivalently obtained either by a full nonequilibrium calculation evaluating the phonon Green's\nfunction19,39,61,62 or by solving a master equation describing the heating of the device,17,23,39 which can be\nviewed as a kinetic-equation-like approximation to the\nfull non-equilibrium Green's functions studies. Knowing\nthe non-equilibrium phonon occupation allows to take\nconsistently into account the effects of phonon heating\nin the non-linear conductance. In our pilot study46 we\nused such an ingredient also to phenomenologically include heating effects in the noise through a single level.63\nHowever, for a fully microscopical calculation of the\nnoise, the situation is considerably more complicated because at finite counting field \u03bb 6= 0, heating effects cannot\nbe expressed solely in terms of the non-equilibrium occupation of the phonon mode. In fact, to include phonon-\n\nheating effects in the generalized Keldysh GF technique\none has to solve the Dyson equation for the phonon\nKeldysh Green's function \u010e\u03bb = d\u02c7 + d\u02c7\u03a0\u030c\u03bb \u010e\u03bb , with the\npolarization operator \u03a0\u030c\u03bb being given in the lowest order\nby the electron-hole bubble,19,39,64 see Fig. 8. Note that\n\u03a0\u030c\u03bb is explicitly \u03bb-dependent via the electronic Green's\nfunctions and so is consequently also the dressed phonon\nGreen's function \u010e\u03bb . At \u03bb 6= 0 the four Keldysh components of \u010e\u03bb are all independent and therefore, even in the\nkinetic limit (phonon line-width neglected), it is not possible to express the effect of heating just in terms of a single non-equilibrium occupation. It is important to notice\nthat substituting \u010e\u03bb for the free phonon Green's function in the expressions for the e-ph self-energies \u03a3\u030cH(F )\ngenerates extra (additive) contributions to the vertex cor(vc)\n(vc)\nrections SH and SF . These contributions, which are\nrelated to the influence of phonon fluctuations on the\nelectronic transport (\"feedback\"), are not included in our\nprevious phenomenological treatment of heating effects\non noise46 and they could possibly account for the discrepancy between our result and an unpublished one by\nJouravlev and coworkers,65 which predicts the noise to\ngrow with voltage above the phonon emission threshold\n(Ref. 65)\nas Seph\n\u223c V 4 , in contrast to the quadratic behav(Ref. 46)\n\nior of Ref. 46, Seph\n\u223c V 2 . The idea that phonon\nheating effects could be responsible for a nonlinear voltage dependence of \u2202Seph /\u2202V is further corroborated by\na recent work by Urban et al.,64 which, however, predicts\n(Ref. 64)\nSeph\n\u223c V 3 . An independent calculation is therefore\nrequired to settle this issue. Careful inclusion of phonon\nheating effects into the noise calculations then certainly\nrepresents a relevant extension of our studies, furthermore urged by the relevance of heating in several IETS\nand PCS experiments.\nVery recently, a lot of interest has been paid to the\nstudy of current-induced excitations of local spin degrees\nof freedom in spin-dependent IETS set-ups.13\u201315,66\u201370\nSeveral of these calculations66,68,69 rely on a perturbative approach analogous to the lowest order expansion of\nRef. 18, also used in this paper. So far, those studies have\ndealt exclusively with the non-linear conductance and the\nstudy of current noise in those spin systems would be a\nmost natural next step. Our method can be straightforwardly extended in this direction, as long as the occupation of spin states is described in a phenomenological way\nvia the master equation68 (or just by thermal distribution). However, possible further extensions to account for\nfluctuations of a non-equilibrated spin remain, even conceptually, an open question, because of the anharmonic\nnature of the free spin. Furthermore, the applicability\nof the lowest order expansion itself for the description of\nthe spin-dependent IETS experiments seems to be currently under debate and renormalized perturbation theories might be necessary for a proper description of observed phenomena. Addressing these problems in the\nnoise context constitutes an interesting future research\ndirection.\n\n\f11\n\n\u03a0\u030c\u03bb =\n\nFIG. 8. Diagram corresponding to the polarization bubble for\nthe phonon \u03a0\u030c\u03bb . The plain lines and the dots represent the\nelectronic Green's functions \u01e7\u03bb and e-ph coupling constant\nM, respectively.\n\nFinally, the calculation of arbitrary cumulants based\non the generalized Keldysh GF technique can be implemented numerically54,64 to address the cases of structured tunneling density of states and/or stronger e-ph\ncoupling, which go beyond our analytical treatment. On\nthe other hand, for the case of weak coupling addressed\nin this work, such numerical methods will face convergence/efficiency problems due to very sharp phonon lineshapes and unnecessary self-consistency loops. In this\nrespect, when complemented by ab-initio calculations for\n(qel)\nthe transport coefficients Tr{T}, Tr{TH }, . . . , our approach is designed to be a very efficient alternative to the\nfull numerics in the limit of weak coupling and slowly\nvarying electronic density of states. It uses the realistic static calculations of the electronic Green's functions,\nphonon modes, and their coupling as input parameters\nand yields reliable results for the dynamical effects in the\nelectronic noise.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank D.

(16) can be recast in the following form\nZ\n\u0001\n\b\nS (mf)\n=\nd\u03b5 Tr i\u0393L fL G> \u2212 (1 \u2212 fL )G<\n2\ne /h\n+ \u0393L G> \u0393L G< + \u0393L (Gr \u2212 Ga )\u0393L fL G> (A1)\n\u0001\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 fL )G< \u2212 fL (1 \u2212 fL ) Ga \u0393L Ga \u0393L\n\u0001\n+ Gr \u0393L Gr \u0393L ,\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212+\nr\na\nr \u2020\nwith G\u2276 \u2261 G\u2213\u00b1\n\u03bb=0 , G = G\u03bb=0 \u2212 G\u03bb=0 and G = [G ] .\n71\nSuch an expression corresponds exactly to Eq. (30) of\n\nRef. 50. We stress that their result was obtained by truncating the S-matrix expansion by breaking two-particle\nGreen's functions into products of one-particle Green's\nfunctions, see Refs. 50 or 72\u2013Sec. 13.8 for further details.\nThis procedure holds in a mean-field theory, but it misses\nthe contributions given by the vertex correction. For this\nreason we identified Eq. (16) with the mean-field contribution to noise.\nIt can be furthermore shown that Eq. (A1) is equivalent to Eq. (10) of Ref. 41 and to the zero-frequency\nlimit of Eq. (9) of Ref. 42, which therefore represent again\nsolely the mean-field contribution to the noise. We stress\nhowever that, as we will discuss in Appendix D, approximating the noise with the mean-field contribution\ngenerally leads to violation of the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem.\nAppendix B: Electronic density\n\nThe electronic density in the system is given by\nZ\nd\u03b5 \u2212+\nne = \u2212i\ng\n(\u03b5),\n(B1)\n2\u03c0 \u03bb=0\n\u2212+\na\nwhere g\u03bb=0\n= gr \u03a3\u2212+\nT g |\u03bb=0 is the lesser Green's function without the electron-phonon coupling. It should be\nnoticed that the integrand of Eq. (B1) does not have a\nfinite support and therefore in this case integration over\nenergy cannot be carried out in the eWBL approximation. Instead, the energy dependence of gr(a) has to be\ntaken into account while calculating the integral, and\nonly subsequently one is allowed to consider the limits\n\u0393 \u226b eV, ~\u03c90 , kB T or |\u03b5res \u2212 EF | \u226b \u0393, eV, ~\u03c90 , kB T corresponding to the eWBL.\nAs an example we consider here the case of a system\nwith a single electronic level symmetrically coupled to\nunstructured leads with constant \u0393L = \u0393R \u2261 \u0393.

In this\n\n\f12\ncase, it is meaningful to introduce the retarded and advanced self-energies by \u03a3rF \u2261 (\u03a3\u2212\u2212\n\u2212 \u03a3\u2212+\nF\nF )\u03bb=0 and\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2020\na\nr\n\u03a3F = \u03a3F .
