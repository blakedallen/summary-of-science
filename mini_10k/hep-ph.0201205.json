Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics\nState University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-3840, USA\nThis talk reviews some recent trends in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, with emphasis on higher orders\nin perturbation theory, resummation and power corrections.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis talk begins with a few general comments\nabout the place of QCD studies. I go on to give\na few words on the central role played by factorization and related concepts. A brief mention of\nsome important steps forward in multiloop calculations is followed by a description of progress\nin abstracting classes of corrections at arbitrary\norder in perturbation theory. I will argue that\nthe interplay of resummation with power corrections is a link between perturbation theory and\nthe nonperturbative degrees of freedom of QCD.\nA preliminary message in this talk is that QCD\nshould be thought of as the exemplary field theory, one which illustrates all of the paradigms\nof what might be called \"postmodern\" particle\nphysics, characterized by pairs of complementary\nconcepts, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nFigure 1. Dual concepts.\n\nQCD is the meeting ground of all the interactions of the standard model, and indeed, al\u2217 YITP-SB-02-02,\n\nbased on a talk at Light-Cone Physics,\nParticles and Strings, Trento, September 2001.\n\nthough it has only a single dimensional scale itself, \u039bQCD , the influence of electroweak scales,\nthrough the W, Z and quark masses, is profound.\nAt the same time, QCD generates its own secondary scales, though chiral symmetry breaking,\nconfinement and vacuum structure. In so doing, it provides a tapestry of effective theories,\neach fitting into an energy range appropriate to\na particular set of states. Among this list are\nperturbative QCD, heavy quark effective theory,\nnon-relativistic QCD, lattice QCD, and nuclear\nphysics. There is no doubt that QCD is \"correct\", at least the way classical electricity and\nmagnetism is correct, as itself an effective theory\nappropriate to a wide range of phenomena. Tests\nof QCD are, in this sense, tests of quantum field\ntheory itself.\nWe are in a \"golden age\" for hadronic data,\nboth in coverage and quality. The great accelerators of the nineteen nineties, HERA, the\nTevatron, SLC and LEP, brought about a veritable revolution in strong interaction data. Our\nstandards for judging success in fits to this data\nhave correspondingly tightened. In this light, we\ncan judge the experimental and theoretical successes and limitations of our description of deepinelastic structure functions, Fig. 2, side-by-side\nwith data on the transverse momentum distribution of b quarks, Fig. 3.\n2.

F2 data\n\none (or more) momentum scales much larger than\n\u039bQCD , up to corrections that can be estimated.\nFor the simplest cases, observables like e+ e\u2212 total\nand jet cross sections, it is convenient to choose\nthe (renormalization) scale of the QCD coupling\nto equal the hard scale, Q,\nQ2 \u03c3\u0302(Q2 , \u03bc2 , \u03b1s (\u03bc))\n\u0012 \u0013\nX\n1\n2\n2\nn\n=\ncn (Q /\u03bc ) \u03b1s (\u03bc) + O\np\nQ\nn\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n1\n=\ncn (1) \u03b1ns (Q) + O\n.\np\nQ\nn\n\n(1)\n\nIn the second form, the cross section is an expansion in a small parameter \u03b1s (Q), with dimensionless coefficients. Corrections are suppressed\nby powers of the large scale. There are two challenges in treating infrared safe cross sections: the\n\ncalculation of the cn , and the interpretation and\nestimation of power corrections.\nThe set of infrared safe observables is rather\nlimited. The applicability of perturbative methods is greatly expanded by factorization, which\ncan be applied whenever an observable can be\nwritten as a product, or a convolution (denoted \u2297), of a short-distance function, times one\nor more functions that absorb nonperturbative,\nlong-distance dynamics,\nQ2 \u03c3(Q, m)\n\n= \u03c9SD (Q/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) \u2297 fLD (\u03bc, m)\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n,\n(2)\n+O\nQp\n\nwhere \u03bc is the factorization scale, which separates\nthe short- and long-distance components. This\nsort of factorization is familiar from deep-inelastic\nscattering (DIS) inclusive cross sections, where\nthe f 's are parton distributions (PDFs), and from\nhard scattering cross sections at hadronic colliders, but it also applies, in varying forms, to amplitudes for exclusive processes, such as B decays\nand deeply-virtual Compton scattering, It also\napplies to jet cross sections in e+ e\u2212 annihilation,\n\n\f3\nfor events where the jets are very narrow, and\nwhere the cross section is sensitive to relatively\nlong-time behavior.\nDifferent processes demand different proofs for\ntheir factorizations, but there are a number of\ncommon themes. At the basis of all factorization\nis the quantum-mechanical incoherence between\nshort- with long-distance dynamics, and also between different sources of long-distance dynamics\nthat develop at spacelike separations. The first\nallows the operator product expansion in DIS,\nthe second justifies factorization for hadronic collisions.\nThe proverbial \"new physics\" is to be found in\n\u03c9SD ; the long-distance fLD 's are \"universal\", simply in the sense that they do not depend on what's\ngoing on at short distances. Factorization may\nbe regarded from complementary viewpoints. On\nthe one hand, we may think of \u03c9SD as the perturbation expansion in a theory with fLD an IR\nregulator. This would be a \"Wilsonian\" point of\nview, with \u03bc as an infrared cutoff. Another view\nis to describe fLD as a matrix element in an effective theory with \u03c3\u0302SD a matching coefficient, and\n\u03bc the renormalization scale.\nHowever we describe factorization, it can be\nuseful only when the factorization scale \u03bc is large\nenough that we can use perturbation theory to\ncompute the short-distance function. A consequence of this rather simple observation is that,\nwhenever there is factorization, there is a calculable evolution, which can be derived from the\nindependence of the physical cross section from\nthe factorization scale. Denoting infrared mass\nscales by m, we have\nd\nln \u03c3phys (Q, m)\nd\u03bc\nd\n=\u03bc\nln {\u03c9SD (Q/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) \u2297 fLD (\u03bc, m)} , (3)\nd\u03bc\n\n0=\u03bc\n\nso that, very schematically,\n\u03bc\n\nd ln \u03c9\nd ln f\n= \u2212P (\u03b1s (\u03bc)) = \u2212\u03bc\n,\nd\u03bc\nd\u03bc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the (splitting) function P (\u03b1s ) can depend\nonly on the variables held in common between\n\u03c9SD and fLD , which are the coupling and an appropriate convolution variable (or moment vari-\n\nable). For factorizations like Eq. (2), where corrections are power-suppressed, all orders in \u03b1s respect the form of the evolution equation. The solution to any evolution equation can be thought\nof as a resummation of the theory,\n)\n( Z\nQ\nd\u03bc\u2032\n\u2032\nP (\u03b1s (\u03bc )) .(5)\nln \u03c3phys (Q, m) \u223c exp \u2212\n\u03bc\u2032\nLet's first discuss examples of progress in the\ncalculations of the short-distance functions, and\nthen return to examples of what we have learned\nover the past few years from resummations.\n3. HIGHER LOOPS & JETS\n3.1. Toward a Two-loop Phenomenology\n\nThe perturbative running coupling is typically\nquoted at the scale of the Z mass, \u03b1s (MZ ) \u223c 0.12.\nIn a rough sense, then, we can estimate that corrections at \u03b12s are of order 1%. Now it so happens\nthat one percent accuracy in jet cross sections at a\nlinear collider would allow a much more accurate\nextrapolation of Standard Model scales through\ntheir logarithmic evolution to energies characteristic of grand unification. At the same time, one\npercent is roughly the level to which nonperturbative corrections have shrunk for inclusive jet cross\nsections at a few hundreds of GeV. The scales\nof the physics in which we are most interested\nstrongly invite us to two loops.\nReferring to Eq. (1), a summary of the status\nof cn 's is, they are known at next-to-leading order (NLO) up to four jets e+ e\u2212 , and up to NNLO\n\n\f4\nonly for one-scale problems: the e+ e\u2212 total cross\nsection and DIS structure functions. Two loops\nis the frontier of finite-order PQCD. The splitting function for DIS factorization (the DGLAP\nkernels), P (z) are themselves known at order \u03b12s ,\nalthough to make full use of two-loop calculations\nof short-distance functions, we should know them\nat three loops. Here, progress has been\nR made, and\nan increasing number of moments dzz n P (z),\nat \u03b13s have been reported [1,2]. Using these results, there is a budding phenomenology of DIS\nat NNLO [3].\nIn very recent and substantial progress, twoloop QCD corrections to 2 \u2192 2 quark and\ngluon scattering amplitudes have been computed\n[4,5]. These results are the first step along what\npromises to be a very steep path to the computation of cross sections, including phase-space integrals at NNLO. In the estimates of the experts,\nwe are still a number of years away from true\nNNLO jet cross sections, but it should be worth\nthe wait.\n3.2. Energy Flow\nOne fundamental use of the two-loop scattering\namplitudes that are beginning to appear, and the\ncorresponding 2 \u2192 3 and 2 \u2192 4 processes that\nwill follow, is in the computation of jet production\nin hadronic collisions, which will be a background\n(and signal) for new physics. Closely related calculations will also be applied to event shapes in\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation [6]. NLO inclusive jet cross\nsections are a familiar feature from the Tevatron.\nFor the most part, jet events are identified \"algorithmically\", by a series of steps that assigns\nparticles (or calorimeter towers) in an event to a\nlist of jets. Jet algorithms have become quite sophisticated, and are becoming more so [7]. Newer\nversions avoid some of the technical problems that\nhave been associated with previous implementations. The primary requirement of a jet algorithm\nis infrared safety, that is, it should specify cross\nsections that are factorizable into PDFs and a\npertrubative short distance function.\nHere, I would like to mention a class of observables that are supplements to jet algorithms,\nand which quantify the flow of energy [8,9]. One\nof the first, and still familiar, infrared safe cross\n\nsections in electron-positron annihilation is the\nenergy-energy correlation [10]. Energy flow variables are closely related to this concept. These\nobservables are weighted sums that are linear in\nthe momenta of final-state particles. In a notation2 based on the formalism of [8], they may be\nrepresented conveniently as\nJ\u03bc (m \u2261 {\u03b7, \u03c6})\nZ\n= dm\u2032 P\u03bc (m\u2032 ) \u00d7 W(m\u2032 \u2212 m) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the integral is over directions m\u2032 and W is\nthe weighting function, and where\nP\u03bc (m\u2032 ) \u2261\n\nN\nX\n\npi\u03bc \u03b4 (m\u2032 \u2212 mi ) ,\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nfor a state with N final state particles. Properly\nchosen, the weight function themselves can distinguish the gross features of jet events [8,9]. They\nmay also be readily treated with the techniques of\nresummation and, eventually, estimates of power\ncorrections, about which we shall say a bit more\nbelow.\nA feature of jet cross sections is that they discard much of event structure. It may be valuable to measure a variety of weighted energy flow\ncorrelations for events with large transverse momenta, to derive information that is complementary to differential jet cross sections in terms of\ntransverse momentum and rapidity. For example, correlations involving relatively soft particles\nmay well contain information on the flow of color\nat short distances.\nIn time, our understanding of QCD will\nprogress, and we would like to be able to go\nback to the data to ask new questions. Certainly, an ideal to be sought after is to free the\ndata from contemporary theory. This is a difficult\ntask, and complete archival accessibility may be\nan unattainable goal. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to try to keep the reported data as close\nas possible to the observables themselves, rather\nthan to report on secondary quantities. Thus, in\nDIS, it is important to make available measured\ncross sections, in addition to structure functions,\nand certainly to fitted parton distributions.\n2 Described\n\nto me by Walter Giele.\n\n\f5\n4. THRESHOLD RESUMMATION\n\na\n\nNow let us turn to an example that shows how\nit is sometimes possible to organize and compute\na class of corrections to all orders in perturbation\ntheory, in this case through threshold resummation [11].\n4.1. Refactorization and Evolution\nWe consider a short-distance cross section to\nproduce a final state F, of total invariant mass\nQ. Examples include Z production, with Q =\nmZ , and the production of a pair of jets of total\ninvariant mass mJJ = Q, in pp\u0304 collisions. The\nbasic factorization theorem is\nQ2 \u03c3AB\u2192F (Q) =\n\u2297 \u03c9ab\u2192F\n\nfa/A (xa , \u03bc) \u2297 fb/B (xb , \u03bc)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ2\nz=\n, Q, \u03bc .\n(8)\nxa xb S\n\nIn the short distance function \u03c9, the limit z \u2192 1,\nis special. At this point, the partons have only\njust enough energy to produce the observed system F, with nothing left over for radiation. Not\nsurprisingly, the short-distance function is singular at z = 1, although the singularities are integrable. Their integrability is guaranteed by the\nfactorization theorem itself. At order r, we encounter terms,\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011r 1 \u0014 ln2r\u22121 (1 \u2212 z) \u0015\ns\n(r)\n\u03c9ab\u2192F (z) \u223c\n, (9)\n\u03c0\nr!\n1\u2212z\n+\nwith \"plus\" distributions\", defined by their integrals with smooth functions (in this case the\nR1\nR1\nPDFs): 0 dzg(z)[f (z)]+ \u2261 0 (g(z) \u2212 g(1))f (z).\nIn general, the limit z \u2192 1 corresponds to \"elastic\" kinematics, in which the masses of final state\njets are bounded by m2 [Ji ] \u2264 (1 \u2212 z)S. In this\nlimit, bremsstrahlung gluons radiated by the partons involved in the hard scattering are forced to\nbe collinear to the parent parton, as pictured in\nFig. 4.\nNear z = 1, we can invoke the principles\nof quantum mechanical incoherence mentioned\nabove: that the evolutions of the final state jets\ndecouple, not only from the hard scattering, but\nalso from each other. This allows us to \"refactorize\" the hard scattering function \u03c9 in Eq. (8)\n\nd\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 4. Collinear radiation in the elastic limit.\n\ninto convolutions of functions involving the initial, and also the final state jets, as well as soft\nradiation between the jets. As announced above,\nsuch a refactorization leads to new equations for\nevolution, and to resummation, in this case of the\nsingular terms in 1 \u2212 z of Eq. (9). The result is\nmost easily exhibited for Mellin moments of \u03c9,\nwhich exponentiate, in terms of an anomalous dimension A(\u03b1s ):\n\u001aZ 1\n\u001b\nN \u22121\nln\ndzz\n\u03c9a\u0101\u2192F (z, \u03bc)\n0\n\n= \u22122\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndz\n\n0\n\n\u223c2\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2\n\nQ2 /N 2\n\n\u03bc2\n\ndm2\nAa (\u03b1s (m))\n2\n(1\u2212z)2 Q2 m\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndm2\nNm\n.\n(10)\nA\n(\u03b1\n(m))\nln\na\ns\nm2\nQ\nz N \u22121 \u2212 1\n1\u2212z\n\nZ\n\nThis turns out to produce an enhancement in\nthe cross section, which can be large in certain\ncircumstances, but which is often quite modest.\nIt shows how, even in the presence of singular corrections such as (9), next-to-leading order\ncalculations in factorized cross sections can still\ngive reliable answers. Another use of threshold\nresummation is that it automatically organizes,\nand hence reduces, factorization scale dependence\nfrom higher orders. We can see how this comes\nabout by recalling that, as in Eq. (4) above, evolution results from the complementary variations\nof the hard and soft functions in a factorized cross\nsection. Taking the derivative of the resummed\nhard function in Eq. (10), we find\nd ln \u03c9a\u0101 (z)\nd ln \u03bc2\n\n\u223c\n\n2Aa (\u03b1s ) ln N\n\n\f6\n\n\u223c\n\n\u2212\n\nd ln[f \u0303a/A f \u0303\u0101/B ]\n,\nd ln \u03bc2\n\n(11)\n\nin terms of moments of the PDFs, f \u0303. By consistency with Eq. (4), the function A that appears in\nthe resummation formula must be the same function that appears in the 1/[1 \u2212 z]+ term in the\nsplitting functions. At NLO, the left-hand relation in Eq. (11) holds only to order \u03b1s , the first\nterm in the expansion of ln \u03c9, while for the resummed cross section it holds to all orders. This\nleads to an important reduction in factorization\nscale dependence compared to NLO [12\u201314].\n4.2. Color Mixing\nThe result (10) shows only the leading logarithms organized by threshold resummation. Beyond leading log, threshold resummation also\nsheds an interesting light on the evolution of\ncolor from short to long distances. The evolution\nequations that lead to the resummation involve a\n\"refactorization scale\", \u03bc\u2032 , that separates the final state jets from the hard scattering. Like the\nstandard factorization scale, \u03bc\u2032 can vary, in this\ncase between the jet masses, m[Ji ] and the hard\nscale, Q, as illustrated in Fig. 5.\n\na\n\nb\n\nd\n\nc\n\nFigure 5. The refactorization scale.\n\nAs \u03bc\u2032 varies, virtual gluons near scale \u03bc\u2032 pass\nbetween the hard scattering, and the radiation\nfrom the jets. The hard scattering, however, involves color exchange in general, and as gluons\nmove in and out of the short-distance function,\nthe color exchange seen at long distances changes.\nThis leads to a matrix evolution equation beyond\n\nleading logarithm, which governs how color is radiated from short to long distances [15]. From the\neffective theory point of view, the hard scattering\nis an elementary vertex that requires renormalization, and the matrix in the evolution equation\nis the anomalous dimension matrix of that vertex.\nAs an example, we may consider quark pair annihilation into gluons, a reaction of importance\nfor high-pT jets at the Tevatron. Here a color basis for the reaction consists of s-channel singlet,\nand two s-channel octets, of the forms dijk Tk and\nf ijk Tk , where Tk is a (Gell-Mann matrix) generator of SU(3) in the fundamental (quark) representation, and where f and d are the antisymmetric\nand symmetric matrices of the SU(3) algebra, respectively. The T 's couple the color indices of the\nincoming quark pair, and d or f those of the outgoing gluons. The anomalous dimension matrix\nfor this vertex turns out to be\n\u0393S \u2032 =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\u00d7\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03b1s\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n0\n\n0\n\nU \u2212T\n\n0\n\nCA\n(U\n2\n\n2(U \u2212 T )\n\nN 2 \u22124\n(U\n2N\n\n+ T)\n\u2212 T)\n\nCA\n2\nCA\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(U \u2212 T ) \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f8\n(U + T )\n\n\uf8f7\n\nwith T and U defined in terms of the scattering\nangle \u03b8, by T, U \u223c ln(1\u2213cos \u03b8). The resummation\nof next-to-leading logarithms is best carried out\nby going to a diagonal basis for this matrix, with\na result of the form\n( Z\n)\nQ\ndm\nexp \u2212\n[\u03bbj (\u03b1s (m))] ,\n(13)\nQ/N m\nwhere j labels an eigenvector of the color exchange matrix, \u0393S , and where the \u03bb's are the corresponding eigenvalues. The same analysis may\nbe carried out for any partonic reaction, in particular, for g + g \u2192 g + g, where the coupling of the\noctet gluons leads to a 9\u00d79 matrix (which can be\nreduced to 8\u00d78 [15]). Precisely the same matrix\nof anomalous dimensions appears in the calculation of the two loop gluon scattering amplitude\n[5] mentioned above, where it controls poles in\ndimensional regularization of the gg \u2192 gg scattering amplitude, through the function [16]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b20\n1\n\u0393S .\n(14)\n+\nI (1) (\u01eb)(s = \u03bc2R ) \u223c\n\u01eb2\nNc \u01eb\n\n\f7\nThis connection strongly suggests that a combination of resummation analysis with explicit calculations can lead to further insights.\n\n1\n\n5. POWER CORRECTIONS:\nUNIVERSALITY AND BEYOND\n\nZ\n\nOne feature of threshold resummation that we\nhaven't yet emphasized is that, for z close enough\nto one, the m2 integral on the right-hand side of\nEq. (10) goes through \u039bQCD , where the perturbative running coupling that appears in function\nA become undefined. At m = \u039bQCD , the perturbative expression \u03b1s (m) \u223c 2\u03c0/b0 ln(m/\u039bQCD )\nactually has a pole, commonly referred to as its\n\"Landau pole\", by analogy to the corresponding\npole in the QED running coupling at very large\nmomentum. At this scale, perturbation theory\nis not self-consistent, but can be used to identify nonperturbative corrections that restore selfconsistency. In this talk, of course, I cannot do\njustice to the various approaches to the subject,\nbut I'll try to give something of the spirit.\n\n2\n\nFigure 6. Z decay into two jets.\n\n5.2. From the Resummed Cross Section\nto Power Corrections\nIn the resummed cross section of (16), the Landau pole appears in the limit y \u2192 0. The following form generalizes the leading logarithm result:\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5.1. Resummed Thrust\nThe approach I'll take starts with a resummed\ncross section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z\u2217 (Q) \u2192 F. In the\n\"elastic\" limit for F , with two jets of invariant\nmasses mi \u226a Q, we have\n1 \u2212 T \u223c (m21 + m22 )/Q2 \u2192 0 ,\n\n1 d\u03c3PT (1 \u2212 T )\n\u223c\n(16)\n\u03c3tot\ndT\n#\n\" Z\n2\nZ\n1\ndy yQ dm2\nd\nA(\u03b1s (m)) ,\nexp \u2212\ndT\ny y2 Q2 m2\nt\nwhere A(\u03b1s ) is the same function as in threshold\nresummation.\n\nZ\n\n2\n\u223c\ntQ\n\nyQ2\n\ny 2 Q2\n\nZ\n\ndm2\nAq (\u03b1s (m))\nm2\n\nQ2\n\ndm Aq (\u03b1s (m))\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\n\u0012 \u0013n\nZ Q2\n\u221e\nX\n1\ndm2 m\n+\nAq (\u03b1s (m))\nnn! 0\nm2 tQ\nn=2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere T is the thrust. The configuration is illustrated in Fig. 6.\nAs in our discussion of threshold resummation,\nlight-like relative velocities between the jets imply\nfactorization. This leads to evolution and thus to\na cross section resummed in logarithms of t \u2261\n1 \u2212 T,\n\ney/t \u2212 1\ndy\ny\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\u0013n\nZ Q2\n\u221e\nX\n1\ndm2 m2\nAq (\u03b1s (m)) .\nnn! 0\nm2 tQ2\nn=2\n\nIn this expanded form, the range of integration,\nm \u223c \u039bQCD , of each term is explicitly suppressed\nby a power of Q. The first term in the expansion\nis the only one that has the power Q\u22121 . From\nthis point of view, it is natural to think of the 1/Q\nterm as not only dominant, but also as reflecting\nuniversal properties of the strong coupling. Similar resummations can be carried out for a fairly\nlarge class of event shapes e = 1\u2212T, BT , C . . ., all\nconstructed to vanish in the limit of narrow jets.\nAs a minimal approach, we consider only the\nfirst term in the expansion (17), noting that the\ncoefficients of the integral over the running coupling may be different in other event shapes. Tak-\n\n\f8\n\n0.04\n\nAn interesting consequence is that the true nth\nmoments of event shape e are related to the perturbative predictions for the nth and n \u2212 1st moments by\n\u03bbe n\u22121\nhe\niPT .\nQ\n\n0.06\n\n0.06\n\n(20)\n\nObservations of a variety of event shapes [19] fit\nrather well with this picture for the first moments,\nas illustrated by Fig. 7. At the same time, there\nappear to be substantial 1/Q2 corrections in second moments, such as h(1 \u2212 T )2 (Q)i, and indeed,\npurely perturbative descriptions can be given for\nthe first moments [20].\n5.3. Shape Functions\nA natural generalization of (19), sensitive to\ncorrections beyond the first term of (17) is a convolution [21],\nZ eQ\nd\u03c3\nd\u03c3PT (e \u2212 \u01eb/Q)\n=\nd\u01eb fe (\u01eb)\nde\nde\n0\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n,\n(21)\n+O\neQ2\nwhere the nonperturbative \"shape function\" fe is\nindependent of Q. It is therefore sufficient to fit\nf at Q = mZ to derive predictions for all Q. Eq.\n(21) can incorporate all corrections like 1/(tQ)n\nin Eq.

The integral in (18) may be considered as a \"universal\" nonperturbative parameter.\nIts actual value, of course, depends on the upper limit, which serves as a factorization scale\nbetween perturbation theory and long distance\nphysics.\nThis approach predicts a simple shift of the\ncross section [18],\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03c3(e)\nd\u03c3PT (e \u2212 \u03bbe /Q)\n1\n.\n(19)\n=\n+O\nde\nde\ne2 Q2\n\nhen i = hen iPT + n\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\n<\u03c1>\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\n<(1-T)>\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n0.1\n\n0.08\n0.07\n\n0.08\n10\n\n2\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n0.06\n10\n\n2\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n0.4\n0.35\n\n<C>\n\ning this into account, we define [17],\nZ \u03bc0\n(e)\ndk \u03b1s (k) ,\n\u03bbe \u223c CPT Me\n\nL3 Data\n\n0.3\n\nFit\nPerturbative\ncomponent\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n10\n\n2\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\nFigure 7.

CONCLUSION\nThe finiteness of time limited the interesting\ntopics that I was able to cover at Trento, and\nmade it necessary to pass over developments in\nfactorization for exclusive B decay amplitudes\n[25], in high parton density [26], in hadronic spin\nstructure, and in uncertainties in parton distribution functions [27]. Many topics have gone unmentioned, but I hope that I have communicated\npart of the reason why many of us find perturbative QCD and its extensions of enduring interest.\nIt seems clear to me that there is much still to\nbe learned by studying nonperturbative corrections for observables like those discussed in this\ntalk. In some ways, event shapes related to jets\nare the ideal testing ground for the perturbativenonperturbative interface. Perturbation theory is\nthe dominant contribution, but nonperturbative\neffects are substantial and, more importantly, by\nvarying the energy, and studying moments of distributions, and correlations of the kind discussed\nabove, we should be able to \"dial\" the nonperturbative component. In this fashion, we may probe\nthe evolution of this most demanding of field theories in new ways, providing insight not only into\nQCD, but into the enterprise of quantum field\ntheory itself.\n\n\f10\nAcknowledgements\nMy thanks go to the organizers of Light Cone\nPhysics: Particles and Strings, for their invitation, and to the European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas for its hospitality.
