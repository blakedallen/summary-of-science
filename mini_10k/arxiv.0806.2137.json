INTRODUCTION\n\nvelocity \u03a9(\u031f) that is a density-weighted average over z:\n\nThe pioneering study by Blandford & Payne (1982,\nhereafter BP82; see also Chan & Henriksen 1980) opened\nthe door to a physical understanding of the highly collimated jets that emanate from magnetized disks accreting onto central gravitating masses. Pudritz & Norman\n(1983) made the first application to the disks in star formation, while Uchida & Shibata (1985) performed the\nfirst numerical simulations. Collectively, the disk-wind\ncommunity has contributed to much of what we know\nabout the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes of jet\nlaunching, acceleration, and collimation.\nInvoking strong magnetization to aid in the magnetohydrodynamics of the gas above the disk has serious\nconsequences for the gas contained within the disk. Wardle & K\u00f6nigl (1993, hereafter WK93), Ferreira & Pelletier (1995, FP95), Ferreira (1997, F97), Casse & Ferreira (2000, CF00), and Salmeron, K\u00f6nigl, & Wardle\n(2007, SKW07) performed the primary studies of some\nof the effects. The result has been a shrinkage of the\nviable parameter space to launch disk winds. In fact,\nunless the gas diffuses across magnetic field lines at dynamical rates, the sub-Keplerian rotation of the surfaces\nof realistic disks in young stellar objects (YSOs) may\nmake magnetocentrifugally-driven disk winds a severe\nchallenge if their surfaces are cold.\nIn \u00a72, we give the basic equations from the analysis\nof Shu et al. (2007, S07). In \u00a73, we use this analysis to demonstrate that fast disk winds that are more\nthan lightly loaded will not arise if they are thermally\nlaunched. In \u00a74, we review how WK93, FP95, F97,\nCF00, and SKW07 formally escape the conclusions of\n\u00a73 by assuming that the diffusion of gas across magnetic\nfield lines inside the disk occurs on dynamical time scales,\nand we discuss the astrophysical difficulties engendered\nby such a point of view. In \u00a75, we summarize how X-wind\ntheory surmounts the same difficulties.\n\n+\nGM\u2217 \u03a3\nBz B\u031f\n,\n(1)\n\u2212\n2\u03c0\n\u031f2\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant, \u03a3 is the\n+\nsurface density, and Bz and B\u031f\nare, respectively, the\nmidplane and upper surface values of the vertical and\nradial components of the magnetic field. From Amp\u00e8re's\n+\nlaw in cgs units, cB\u031f\n/2\u03c0 equals the vertically integrated\ncurrent density J\u03c6 , where c is the speed of light. Equation (1) then assumes that the Lorentz force per unit\narea, J\u03c6 Bz /c, associated with magnetic tension, provides\nthe only opposition, apart from inertia, to the attraction\nof stellar gravity. We have ignored the self-gravity of the\ndisk, which would additionally hinder the launching of\nmagnetocentrifugal winds. When integrating the divergence of the Maxwerll stress tensor over the disk thickness, we have also ignored terms like \u2212(1/8\u03c0)\u2202(B\u03c62 )/\u2202\u031f\nas being a factor of the disk aspect ratio \u226a 1 smaller than\nthe retained term (1/4\u03c0)\u2202(Bz B\u031f )/\u2202z for a spatially thin\ndisk. Retention of the effects of magnetic and gas pressure, which generally decrease with increasing radius \u031f,\nwould only worsen the problem of sub-Keplerianity detailed below.\nWith f \u0304 denoting the z-averaged fraction of Keplerian\nrotation at \u031f, \u03a9 \u2261 f \u0304\u03a9K where \u03a9K \u2261 (GM\u2217 /\u031f3 )1/2 , we\nobtain (S07, Appendix C)\n\n2.

We define a characteristic thermal velocity a such\nthat a2 \u2261 2z0 P (0)/\u03a3, where P (0) is the midplane gas\npressure. Integrating the equation of vertical hydrostatic\nequilibrium in z gives (S07, Appendix C):\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n+ 2\n2a\nGM\u2217 A\n(B\u031f\n)\n=\u03a3\n\u2212\n,\n(3)\n2\u03c0\nA\u031f\n\u031f2\nwhere we define A and A0 as, respectively, the actual and\nthermal aspect ratios of the disk,\n\u0012 2 \u00131/2\n2a \u031f\nz0\nA0 \u2261\n.\n(4)\nA\u2261 ,\n\u031f\nGM\u2217\n\n\f2\nIn the above, z0 is a vertical height of the disk defined so\nthat the z-integrated value of z\u03c1 from the midplane to\nthe surface \u221a\nof zero gas-pressure equals (z0 /2)(\u03a3/2). Note\nthat A0 = 2(a/\u031f\u03a9K ) \u226a 1 in a thin disk where \u031f\u03a9K\nis the Kepleran speed at radius \u031f.\nWK93, FP95, F97, CF00, and SKW07 never employ\nthe relation (2) to estimate f \u0304. Instead, they allow departures from hydrostatic equilibrium above the disk that\ninvolve advective accelerations in the radial and vertical directions that are O(A0 ) when measured in a nondimensional sense. Section 4 demonstrates that such departures occur only if there is a transonic diffusion of gas\nacross magnetic field lines that include a strong component of B\u03c6 not present in the analysis of S07.\n+\nDenoting B\u031f\n/Bz = Il with Bz \u221d \u031f\u2212(1+l) in selfsimilar models, and substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\nA0 A0\n2\n \u0304\n.\n(5)\n\u2212\n1\u2212f =\nIl\nA\nA0\nThe presence of a radial field B\u031f that increases from\n+\nzero in the midplane to B\u031f\nat the surface compresses\nthe disk and makes A smaller than A0 . In the process,\n1 \u2212 f \u03042 becomes greater than zero.\nTo make contact with disk-wind theory, let us follow\nFP95 in defining a \"magnetization,\"\n\u03bc\u2261\n\nB 2 z0\nBz2\n= z 2,\n4\u03c0P (0)\n2\u03c0\u03a3a\n\n(6)\n\nwhich also equals a quantity that WK93 call \u03b120 . Dividing\nequation (3) by equation (6) now yields Il2 = (2/\u03bc)(1 \u2212\n+\n/Bz by Il . Using\nA2 /A20 ), where we have replaced B\u031f\nthis relation to eliminate A/A0 from equation (5) now\ngives\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA0\n1\n1 \u2212 f \u03042 =\n\u2212 Cl (\u03bc) ,\n(7)\nIl Cl (\u03bc)\nwhere the positive quantity Cl (\u03bc) = A/A0 is Cl (\u03bc) \u2261\n(1 \u2212 Il2 \u03bc/2)1/2 \u2264 1.\nThe maximum value of \u03bc allowed mechanically in equation (7) comes by setting f \u0304 = 0. The aspect ratio then\nassumes the minimum value:\n\u0015\n\u0014q\nIl\n2\n(8)\nAmech =\n1 + 4 (A0 /Il ) \u2212 1 .\n2\nFrom Cl (\u03bcmech ) = Amech /A0 , we obtain \u03bcmech:\n\u0015\n\u0014q\n1\n2\n\u03bcmech = 2\n1 + 4 (A0 /Il ) \u2212 1 .\nA0\n\n(9)\n\nFor \u03bc > \u03bcmech , magnetic forces are too strong for centrifugal equilibrium to be possible. For \u03bc = \u03bcmech in thin\ndisks where A0 /Il \u226a 1, the roots (8) and (9) take the\napproximate forms, Amech \u2248 A20 /Il , \u03bcmech \u2248 2/Il2 .\nIn the model of BP82 and in cases where the wind is\nrelatively lightly loaded (e.g., F97), l = 1/4 or nearly\nso, i.e., Bz \u221d \u031f\u22125/4 . The magnetic configuration just\nabove the disk is then well approximated by a vacuum\nfield, where the analysis of S07 yields Il = 1.43. The\ncorresponding inclination angle of the field from the vertical is i = 55\u25e6 . With Il = 1.43, \u03bcmech \u2248 0.978. For \u03bc\nnot closely approaching \u03bcmech , say, \u03bc \u2248 0.731 where the\n\nmagnetic compression C(\u03bc) \u2248 0.5, the right-hand side\nof equation (7) is O(A0 ) \u226a 1. The analogous feature in\nnumerical calculations, combined with the ameliorating\neffects of rapid diffusion, led disk-wind theorists to assert that the departure from Keplerian rotation remains\nsmall enough for other effects to overcome the deficit.\n3. THERMAL LAUNCHING\n\nThermal pressure cannot do the requisite job in the\nabsence of fast (turbulent) diffusion (see \u00a74). Published\nmodels have the deficit of f from unity at the compressed\nsurface z = z0 both larger than average (e.g., Fig. 5 of\nFP95) and smaller than average (e.g., Fig. 1 of SKW07).\nAs a fiducial case, we assume the disk's surface to have\nthe z-averaged f obtained from equation (7). To have a\nsignificant pressure exhaust of gas onto open field lines,\nwe then require the thermal speed squared a2s at the surface of the disk to be (S07, eq. 31):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nGM\u2217\n1\n1\na2s = (1 \u2212 f \u03042 )\n=\n\u2212 Cl (\u03bc) a2 ,\n4\n\u031f\n2Il A0 Cl (\u03bc)\n(10)\nwhere we applied equations (4) and (7) in the last step.\nWithout external heating, the surface temperature of\nthe disk, \u223c 2\u22121/4 times the effective temperature, will\nbe lower than its characteristic interior value, i.e., a2s =\n\u0398s a2 where \u0398s is a fraction . 1. Equation (10) then\nyields a quadratic equation for Cl (\u03bctherm ) = Atherm /A0 ,\nwhose solution is\ni\nhp\n1 + (Il \u0398s A0 )2 \u2212 (Il \u0398s A0 ) .\n(11)\nAtherm = A0\nFrom Cl (\u03bctherm ) = Atherm /A0 , we obtain \u03bctherm :\ni\n\u0398s A0 hp\n\u03bctherm = 4\n1 + (Il \u0398s A0 )2 \u2212 (Il \u0398s A0 ) . (12)\nIl\nFor thin disks where Il \u0398s A0 \u226a 1, equations (11) and\n(12) give Atherm \u2248 A0 , \u03bctherm \u2248 4\u0398s A0 /Il . The righthand side of the second relation is, at most, several percent in the inner tenth of an AU in YSO disks. The\nmagnetization is then so weak that the associated departure from Keplerian rotation from equation (7), 1 \u2212 f \u03042\n\u2248 2\u0398s A20 , would be similar to that implied by the radial\ngradients of the thermal gas pressure, i.e., very small.\nBut weak magnetization, \u03bc \u2264 \u03bctherm , with good field\nloading, does not provide a long enough lever arm to\nlaunch fast disk winds even if f \u0304 = 1 (see \u00a73.5 of CF00).\nIf the disk magnetization \u03bc is chosen greater than\n\u03bctherm, but less than \u03bcmech, the actual departure 1 \u2212 f \u03042\n\u223c O(A0 ) exceeds the depth of the dimensionless effective\npotential 1 \u2212 f \u03042 \u223c O(A20 ) that the surface temperature\ncan offset. Because a2s may be less than 1% of GM\u2217 /\u031f\nin the inner disk, even f \u0304 = 0.99 may constitute a substantial barrier by these standards. As argued earlier,\nno room exists for a compromise \u03bc between \u03bctherm and\n\u03bcmech that will drive disk winds that both load and fling\nif one depends on thermal pressure to launch.\n4. DIFFUSIVE LOADING\n\nWK93, FP95, F97, CF00, and SKW07 differ with the\nanalysis of \u00a7\u00a72 and 3 because they do not invoke thermal\npressure to launch disk winds. Instead, they overcome\n\n\f3\nlocal deficits in f by diffusive loading onto magnetic-field\nlines coupled to magnetocentrifugal acceleration.\nFor an imperfectly conducting, lightly ionized, gas, sufficiently collisional to act as a single-component fluid of\nvelocity v, the induction equation reads\n\u2202B\n+ \u2207 \u00d7 (B \u00d7 v) = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 [\u03b7 * (\u2207 \u00d7 B)] ,\n\u2202t\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is a generalized tensor resistivity associated with\nOhm's law (Norman & Heyvaerts 1985, see especially\neq. 22). In a frame that corotates locally with the magnetic field, so that \u2202B/\u2202t = 0, we may \"uncurl\" equation\n(13) and obtain the balance of advection and diffusion,\nB\u00d7u = \u2212\u03b7*(\u2207\u00d7B), where u is the fluid velocity relative\nto the rotating field lines.\nKeeping only the dominant terms in a thin disk, we\nfollow WK93 and SKW07 in decomposing the advectiondiffusion balance into its \u03c6 and \u031f components:\nBz u\u031f \u2212 B\u031f uz = \u03b72\nr\n\nB\u03c6 uz \u2212 Bz (f \u2212 fB )\n\n\u2202B\u031f\n\u2202B\u03c6\n\u2212 \u03b71\n,\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(14)\n\nGM\u2217\n\u2202B\u03c6\n\u2202B\u031f\n= \u03b71\n\u2212 \u03b72\n, (15)\n\u031f\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nwhere the dimensionless rotation of the field fB is a function of z at fixed \u031f (in such an Eulerian description, we\nare not following a given field line). For WK93, \u03b71 is associated with the coefficient of ambipolar diffusion, and\n\u03b72 , with the inverse of the Hall conductivity. In F97, and\n\u2032\nCF00, \u03b71 is replaced by \u03bdm in equation (14) and by \u03bdm\nin equation (15), with the other, non-diagonal, coefficient\n\u03b72 set to zero.\nIn the disk proper (where uz is small) of both Figure\n1 of SKW07 and Figure 5 of FP95, the terms on the\nright-hand sides of equations (14) and (15) contribute,\nrespectively, negatively to the radial drift and positively\nto the tangential drift relative to the field lines. These\nrelative motions reverse as the gas climbs vertically into\nthe disk wind. Eventually, the right-hand sides vanish\nas ideal MHD is approached (\u03b71 and \u03b72 \u2192 0), with u\nbecoming parallel to B in the corotating frame. The\nphysical interpretation of the result is as follows.\nA field line rotates at a dimensionless angular velocity fB that is intermediate between the rotation rate f\nof the gas near the midplane layers of the disk and the\ngas in the upper atmosphere that blows into a disk wind.\nThis rate is fixed in steady state so that angular momentum balance is reached following a given field line\n(a condition not examined in this paper). In the WK93\ndescription, the neutral gas near the midplane would rotate at the Kepler speed except for collisions with ions\nand electrons that are tied to the more slowly rotating\nmagnetic field lines. The collisions therefore make the\nneutral gas lose angular angular momentum, which then\ncause the neutrals to drift radially inward relative to the\nradially stationary field lines and the ions and electrons\ntied to them.\nFreezing to field lines in the upper atmosphere of the\ndisk yields the familiar effect of a \"sliding bead on a\nrotating rigid wire\" (Chan & Henriksen 1980) that accelerates the gas through the slow MHD transition as\nit gains angular momentum at the expense of the matter in the deeper layers of the disk. Thus, the gas that\n\nparticipates in the disk wind ends up rotating at superKeplerian speeds. A similar phenomenon occurs in the\nFP95 description, except that the role of collisions between neutrals and ions/electrons is replaced by a mixing\nof fluid parcels created by MHD turbulence.\nWhen an outwardly bending field line rotates uniformly along its length, there will always be a point where\ncentrifugal effects on an electrically conducting test particle placed there counterbalances an opposing gravitational field. In Figure 5 of FP95 and Figure 1 of SKW07,\nthis point occurs at \u223c 2vT /\u03a9K , where vT is the thermal\nvelocity in the midplane. For a vertically isothermal\ndisk\n\u221a\n(the most optimistic case), where a = (2/ \u03c0)vT , this\npoint is \u223c 2.5z0 since z0 \u223c 0.5A0 \u031f \u223c 0.8vT /\u03a9K for typical parameters used to launch disk winds. The height z0\nis defined by where the condition of vertical hydrostatic\nequilibrium would have created a surface. As in any atmosphere, the gas density does not really drop abruptly\nto zero at z0 , but unless diffusion works very efficiently,\nthere cannot be much gas at 2.5z0 .\nTrouble on this point enters when numerical solutions\nare adjusted to give large rates of diffusion. In order\n+\nof magnitude, let us estimate \u2202B\u031f /\u2202z \u223c B\u031f\n/z0 and\n\u2202B\u03c6 /\u2202z \u223c B\u03c6+ /z0 in the disk proper. In the more successful cases considered by FP95, the quantities \u03b71 \u223c\n+\nz0 a \u223c \u03b72 . With B\u031f\n> 0 and \u2212B\u03c6+ > 0 comparable in\nmagnitude to Bz > 0, equations (14) and (15), with uz\nnegligible in the disk proper, now yield the estimates,\na\nu\u031f \u223c \u2212a,\nf \u2212 fB \u223c p\n\u223c A0 .\n(16)\nGM\u2217 /\u031f\n\nThe first deduction, that the inward drift speed in the\nbulk of the disk approaches sonic values, is verified, for\nexample, by Figure 4 of FP95 where u\u031f \u2248 \u2212vT . The\nsecond deduction, that the dimensionless rotation rate\nof the gas f can exceed that of the field fB by O(A0 ),\nwould produce favorable conditions for the launching of\ndisk winds if the field rotates slower than the gas in the\ndisk proper, but still within fraction O(A0 ) of Keplerian.\nIn the work of FP95, the diffusion coefficients \u03b71 and \u03b72\nare chosen large enough so that, unlike S07, the magnetic\nfield is not well coupled to the matter in the deep interior\nof the disk. With \u03b71 \u223c z0 a, the diffusive time scale to\nstraighten poloidal field lines that are bent on a scale z0\nis \u223c z02 /\u03b71 \u223c z0 /a, which is of order the inverse Kepler\nrate \u03a9\u22121\nK (or shorter, if the disk is severely magnetically\ncompressed). The dynamical slippage of the matter past\nthe field, both in the \u031f and \u03c6 directions, is a serious\nweakness of the models.\nRapid diffusion can carry gas to the slow MHD transition point beyond which magnetocentrifugal fling works\nin the outward direction to produce an outflowing wind.\nSuch a strategy generates, through equations (14) and\n(16), radial drift speeds inside the disk that are transonic\n\u223c \u2212vT . Consider what this implies if a disk wind were\nresponsbile for the primary accretion mechanism of the\ndisk all the way out to an outer disk radius \u223c 300 AU in\na low-mass YSO. The midplane temperature at 300 AU\nis unlikely to be much less than, say, 20 K, which corresponds to an isothermal sound speed in cosmic molecular\ngas of vT = 0.278 km s\u22121 . The whole disk would then\nshrink onto the star in 300 AU/(0.278 km s\u22121 ) \u223c 5,000\nyr, which is far too short a time scale to be realistic.\n\n\f4\nIf global magnetorotational instability is a viable alternative for YSO accretion disks, the analysis of S07\nand Shu et al. (2008) implies that the turbulent resistivity \u03b71 is smaller than estimated by FP95 or F97 by\nan additional factor \u223c \u03bcA \u226a 1. If we continue to as+\nsume that \u2212B\u03c6+ and B\u031f\nare comparable to Bz , with the\nformer holding only if disk winds can be launched, then\nequations (14) and (15) imply\nu\u031f \u223c \u2212\u03bcAa,\n\nf \u2212 fB \u223c \u03bcAA0 . A20 .\n\n(17)\n\nThe second relation above states that diffusion can now\nmake up deficits of fB only by amounts . A20 , where\nfB itself is given by f \u0304 to O(A20 ) in such circumstances.\nIn turn, f \u0304 departs from Keplerian rotation typically by\nO(A0 ) for strongly magnetized disks according to equation (7). A low (S07; see also Lubow et al. 1993) rather\nthan a high (FP95 or F97) rate of field diffusion yields\nequation (10) as, after all, the correct approximate criterion for wind loading and launching.\nThe numerical choices made by WK93 are more conservative than those of FP95, and the net results for\nu\u031f and f \u2212 fB are intermediate between the high- and\nlow-diffusion scenarios described above (see Appendix\nof WK93). Specifically, in the numerical\n\u221a case depicted\nin Figure 1 of SKW07, where \u03b10 \u2261 \u03bc = 0.95 and\na2s = vT2 = 0.01GM\u2217/\u031f, the dimensionless loading is\n\u03ba = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and the square of the lever arm is \u03bb = 395\n(these are \u03b2 \u22121 and Jw , respectively, in the notation of Xwind theory), corresponding indeed to a disk wind that\ncan fling, but is very lightly loaded. Such winds do not\ndescribe observed YSO jets well. The order of magnitude\nchanges (exponential sensitivity) in quantities like \u03ba and\n\u03bb when \u03b7 changes by a factor of a few gives powerful testimony to the crucial role that magnetic diffusivity plays\nin current theories of the launching of disk winds.\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nDisk winds have been invoked as a solution to the angular momentum problem in accretion disks (e.g., Pelletier\n\n& Pudritz 1992). The challenge of sub-Keplerian rotation facing magnetocentrifugally-driven, cold, disk winds\nfor much, if not most, of its radial span suggests that internal mechanisms other than the back reaction to disk\nwinds must account for the primary accretion mechanism\nof such disks. Examples of such mechanisms include spiral density waves for high-mass disks and the magnetorotational instability for low-mass disks.\nDisruption of the disk at an inner edge by a stellar\nmagnetosphere will drive an X-wind (Cai et al. 2008 and\nreferences therein) if the resistivity in the disk is appreciably smaller than the viscosity (for numerical simulations, see Romanova et al. 2008). How does X-wind theory escape the conundrum posed by equation (1)? Near\nthe inner edges of disks, the X field geometry involves a\nswing of outwardly bending field lines (right half of X) to\ninwardly bending field lines (left half of X) as accretion\ndisks are truncated by funnel flows through their interac+\ntions with a stellar magnetosphere. The swing of B\u031f\nBz\nfrom positive values through zero (vertical field lines that\nare \"dead\" to outflow or inflow) automatically promotes\na transition from sub-Keplerian to Keplerian rotation.\nIndeed, when the density decreases sharply inward on\na fractional radial scale \u223c A0 , the no-longer ignorable,\nextra, radial push of gas pressure toward the inner edge\nspeeds up disk rotation and makes the footpoints of some\nof the outwardly bending field lines exterior to the dead\nzone sufficiently close to Keplerian rotation as to enable\nthe thermal launching of X-winds (see the discussion of\nShu et al. 2008).\nWe thank Sylvie Cabrit, Jonathan Ferreira, Al Glassgold, Arieh K\u00f6nigl, Raquel Salmeron, and Mark Wardle\nfor comments that improved the presentation of the paper.
