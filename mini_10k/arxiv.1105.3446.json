Researchers have focused on two-level charge fluctuators3,4\nas candidate sources of energy- and coherence-loss in superconducting qubits5\u201311 . Superconducting resonators,\nwhich are sensitive probes of bulk two-level system (TLS)\nloss, are also useful for dispersive qubit readout using circuit QED12 , single artificial-atom lasing13 and single photon detection14 . Experiments focusing on dielectric loss\nin superconducting resonators have previously employed\na classical description of the resonator15,16 . However,\nmany of these experiments involve low microwave-photon\nnumbers and properly require a full quantum mechanical\nanalysis for their interpretation17,18 .\nIn this article we quantize the classical theory of loss\ndue to two-level systems (TLSs) to obtain the familiar Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) of quantum optics19 .\nAlthough the JCM has been studied thoroughly in both\natomic and solid-state physics, to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to explore the loss regimes\npresented here20,21 , nor has it specifically been used to\nevaluate loss tangents. (In a similar way, there has\nbeen recent renewed interest in the JCM arising from\nnanofabricated solid state systems that are beginning to\nbroach parameter regimes inaccessible to atomic physics\nexperiments22\u201325 ).\nIn this paper we use the JCM to analyse a simplified\nset-up designed to capture the essence of resonator loss :\na harmonic oscillator that can release quanta to a zerotemperature thermal bath only through a resonant TLS.\nWe neglect the fact that a resonator may interact with\nmany TLSs. Working with this minimal model allows us\nto establish the dynamics of decay and to demarcate various parameter regimes. This model can serve as a starting point for studies of quantum mechanical loss in more\ncomplex systems. It also allows us to generate transparent analytic expressions for the resonator photon number,\nTLS excitation and coherence, as well as system correlations, which are of interest not only in the context of res-\n\nonator loss but also for control and manipulation of the\nfull system8,21 . Our analysis shows agreement between\nthe quantum and classical theories for weak coupling between the resonator and the TLS. However in the case\nof strong coupling, we find the quantum theory predicts\na significantly lower loss than the classical theory when\nthe TLS is unsaturated. Also, in contrast to the classical\ncase, the photon number at which the loss saturates does\nnot depend on the resonator-TLS coupling.\nThe remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. In\nSection II we summarize the classical model of loss and\nproceed to quantize it, arriving at the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel; in Section III we describe two numerical approaches towards solving the problem, using the master\nequation and the Maxwell-Bloch equations respectively;\nin Section IV we present approximate analytical solutions to the Maxwell-Bloch equations which allow us to\nidentify loss regimes exhibiting qualitatively different behavior. Section V supplies a conclusion.\n\nII.\n\nCLASSICAL AND QUANTUM MODELS OF\nLOSS\n\nIn this section we briefly restate the TLS model that\ntreats the superconducting resonator classically and proceed to quantize it to obtain the JCM. This exercise allows us to directly relate the parameters of the two models.\n\nA.\n\nClassical model\n\nThe classical model consists of a defect with charge\nq that can tunnel between two spatially distinct sites\nseparated by a distance l inside the dielectric that is\npermeated by the electric field of the superconducting\nresonator26. The onsite energies of the two states |Li\nand |Ri are \u00b1\u2206/2 respectively and the height of the tunneling barrier is \u22060 . The defect is driven by an electric\nfield of magnitude F (t) which is directed at an angle \u03b8\n\n\f2\nwith respect to a line joining the two charge sites. The\nclassical Hamiltonian of this system may be written as\n\u0014\n\u0015\np cos \u03b8F (t)\u22060\nE\np cos \u03b8F (t)\u2206\nHC =\n\u03c3z +\n+\n\u03c3x + U,\n2\n2E\n2E\n(1)\nwhere E 2 = \u22062 + \u220620 , p = ql and the Pauli matrices \u03c3z\nand \u03c3x have been defined in the energy basis\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n|Li + sin |Ri\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n|\u2212i = sin |Li \u2212 cos |Ri,\n2\n2\n\n|+i = cos\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is of the form of the standard JCM, HJCM =\nh\u0304g(a\u03c3+ + a\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 ), with a coupling constant given by\ng=\n\nwhere \u01eb and \u03bc are the electric permittivity and magnetic susceptibility respectively and B(t) is the magnetic\nfield. The energy U is usually not included in the classical model since the fields are not dynamical variables\nin that case; however it is relevant to the quantization of\nthe problem below.\n\nB.\n\nQuantum model\n\nTo quantize the electromagnetic field in the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) we use the prescriptions29\n\u0002\n\u0003\nU \u2192 h\u0304\u03c9a\u2020 a, F (t) \u2192 F0\u2032 a(t) + a\u2020 (t) ,\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency of the resonator,\nr\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\u2032\nF0 =\n,\n2\u01ebV\n\n(5)\n\nis the 'electric field per photon', V is the effective mode\nvolume of the resonator and a(a\u2020 ) is an annihilation (creation) operator obeying the bosonic commmutation rule\n[a, a\u2020 ] = 1. We thus obtain the quantum Hamiltonian,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2206\nE\n+ p cos \u03b8F0\u2032\n(a + a\u2020 ) \u03c3z\nHQ = h\u0304\u03c9a\u2020 a +\n2\n2E\n\u2206\n0\n+p cos \u03b8F0\u2032\n(a + a\u2020 )(\u03c3+ + \u03c3\u2212 ),\n(6)\n2E\nwhere \u03c3\u00b1 are the TLS raising and lowering operators\nrespectively. Assuming the resonance condition h\u0304\u03c9 =\nE, transforming to the interaction picture with respect\nto H0 = h\u0304\u03c9(a\u2020 a + \u03c32z ) and making the rotating wave\napproximation, we arrive at\n\u2032\nHQ\n= p cos \u03b8F0\u2032\n\n\u22060\n(a\u03c3+ + a\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 ),\n2E\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nIn the remainder of the paper we will persist in using g\nfor the sake of avoiding lengthy expressions. Below we\nwill consider the evolution of the TLS-resonator system\nwhen it is connected to reservoirs that cause relaxation\nand dephasing.\nIII.\n\nwith tan \u03b1 = \u22060 /\u2206.

For simplicity, we have not included an external drive for the resonator. We have also assumed that\nthe resonator suffers no intrinsic loss since we wish to\nstudy loss via the TLSs15,16 . The typical frequencies of\nresonator operation correspond to energies much higher\nthan available in a cryogenic environment (h\u0304\u03c9 \u226b kB T ),\njustifying our assumption of a zero-temperature reservoir\nabove. Other regimes of the damped TLS-oscillator system have been addressed in, for example Ref. 17.\nThe numerical solutions to Eq. (9) will be discussed in\nthe context of the analytic results presented in Section\nIV below.\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nMaxwell-Bloch equations\n\nWhile Eq. (9) allows us to obtain a fully quantum\nmechanical solution to the problem, it can involve the\npopulation and coherence dynamics of a large number of\nstates, especially for high initial photon numbers in the\nresonator. In this case it is useful to have a less intensive,\nand only slightly less rigorous, numerical approach to the\nproblem. This route is provided by the Maxwell-Bloch\nequations28 which follow from Eq. (9),\nh\u0227i = \u2212igh\u03c3\u2212 i,\n\n(10)\n\n1\nh\u03c3\u2212 i,\n(11)\nT2\n\u0001\n1\nh\u03c3\u0307++ i = \u2212ig ha\u03c3+ i \u2212 ha\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 i \u2212 h\u03c3++ i, (12)\nT1\nh\u03c3\u0307\u2212 i = 2igha\u03c3++ i \u2212 ighai \u2212\n\nwhich form a set of four closed equations if the conjugate\nof Eq. (17) is included. The numerical solutions to these\nequations are substantially quicker to obtain compared\nto the master equation and will be discussed below with\nreference to their approximate analytic solutions.\nIV.\n\nIn order to identify the various regimes of loss and to\norganize the numerical solutions to the master equation\n[Eq. (9)], we now discuss the problem in terms of approximate analytical solutions to the equations of motion. It is\nwell known from previous studies that the JCM displays\nqualitatively different behavior in the regimes of weak\n(g < 1/T1 , 1/T2 ) and strong (g > 1/T1, 1/T2 ) coupling30 .\nWe now consider the two regimes separately.\n\nwhere \u03c3++ = (1 + \u03c3z )/2 is the population operator for\nthe upper TLS level |+i, and\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n.\nT2\n2T1\nT\u03c6\n\n(13)\n\nWe can also find from Eq. (9) the equation for the dynamics of the average photon number,\nh\u1e45(t)i =\n\n\u0001\nd \u2020\nha ai = ig ha\u03c3+ i \u2212 ha\u2020 \u03c3\u2212 i .\ndt\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nwhich represents the conservation of energy in the system. The LHS of Eq. (15) denotes the rate of change of\nthe the combined TLS-oscillator energy, while the RHS\nsignifies the rate at which the TLS releases quanta into\nthe bath. We will use Eq. (15) to generate simple analytical results below.\nIt can be seen that Eqs. (10)-(12) do not constitute a\nclosed set of equations. While the correlations in those\nequations are relevant to the full quantum solution of the\nproblem, they turn out to play a negligible role in two\ncases : a) when the oscillator excitation is very low, since\nthe TLS is then mostly in its ground state which then\nfactors from the resonator state, and b) when the oscillator excitation is very high, since in this case the TLS is in\na fully mixed state. We therefore assume decorrelations\nsuch as ha\u03c3+ i \u2243 haih\u03c3+ i, etc., so that Eqs. (10)-(12) now\nbecome\nh\u0227i = \u2212igh\u03c3\u2212 i,\n\nA.\n\nWeak coupling : g < 1/T1 , 1/T2\n\nFor weak coupling the JCM dynamics are dominated\nby relaxation and dephasing processes, allowing for little\ncoherence between the resonator and the TLS. Below we\nwill see that in this case the TLS may be considered as\nbeing driven by the resonator at a time-dependent Rabi\nfrequency\n\u03a9q = 2ghn(t)i1/2 .\n\nCombining Eqs. (12) and (14) we find,\n1\nd\n[hn(t)i + h\u03c3++ i] = \u2212 h\u03c3++ i,\ndt\nT1\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION : ANALYTICAL\nTREATMENT\n\n(16)\n\n1\nh\u03c3\u0307\u2212 i = 2ighaih\u03c3++ i \u2212 ighai \u2212 h\u03c3\u2212 i,\n(17)\nT2\n\u0001\n1\nh\u03c3\u0307++ i = \u2212ig haih\u03c3+ i \u2212 ha\u2020 ih\u03c3\u2212 i \u2212 h\u03c3++ i, (18)\nT1\n\n(19)\n\nTo find analytical solutions in this regime we consider the\nfollowing argument.\nIf the Rabi drive due to the resonator could be held\nconstant, we could obtain steady state solutions for the\nTLS variables. However the drive depends on the number\nof resonator quanta, and thus itself changes with time.\nNonetheless, if the photon number changes slowly compared to the rate at which the TLS relaxes to equilibrium,\nwe can assume the drive to be quasistatic, evaluate the\nTLS variables in the steady state, and then finally solve\nfor the resonator dynamics. The above scheme amounts\nto a Born-Oppenheimer approximation where the TLS\ndynamics are considered as fast and the resonator dynamics as slow.\nSolving Eqs.

However\nin the weak coupling regime this term is always larger\nthan T1 .\nAs shown in Fig. 1 the analytical expression of Eq. (24)\nagrees well with the numerical solutions of both the master equation and the Maxwell-Bloch equations. We note\nthat exponential decay of oscillator energy corresponds\nclassically to the motion of a pendulum damped by a\nviscous fluid such as air, and is often referred to as 'wet'\nfriction.\nThe analytical solution for the population h\u03c3++ (t)i can\nbe found self-consistently by using Eq. (24) in Eq. (23).\nThe dynamics of the population are shown in Fig. 2 and\nexhibit the validity of the analytical solution except for\nthe non-adiabatic behavior at early times when the TLS\nundergoes rapid excitation in our numerical simulations.\nIt can be seen in this regime that the TLS is far from saturation and transports quanta efficiently into the reservoir.\nWe note that our R(t) \u226a 1 theory agrees with the\nresult for a qubit coupled to a TLS9 .

The numerical solution to the master and\ndecorrelated Maxwell-Bloch equations match quite well. The\nanalytical Born-Oppenheimer solution of Eq. (26) is constant\nand approximates the fact that the TLS is saturated most of\nthe time.\n\nA plot of Eq. (27) shown in Fig. 3 matches well the numerical calculation in the regime of linear decay and gives\ncorrectly a slope of \u22121/2T1. The linearity of the decay is\nviolated only at very long times when the photon number\nbecomes very low and R(t) is no longer large compared\nto unity.\nWe note that linear decay of oscillator energy corresponds classically to the motion of an oscillator impeded\nby a frictional force always opposed to the oscillator's\nvelocity but constant in magnitude, and is referred to\nas 'dry' friction. An analytically solvable example is of\na mass on a spring, vibrating horizontally on a surface\nand damped by sliding friction proportional to the normal force31,32 . Clearly the frictional force 'saturates' at\na constant value in this instance. A comparison may be\nmade between Fig. 3 and that for the energy decay for a\nclassical oscillator under dry friction (Fig. 5 in Ref. 32),\nincluding the nonlinear decay towards the end.\nThe population dynamics of the TLS are shown in\nFig. 4. It can be seen that in this regime the TLS is\nalmost always saturated and therefore can only accept\nquanta from the resonator limited by the rate at which\nit can release them into the bath.\n\nfrom the classical model and could be carried out numerically by extending the quantum model that we consider\nhere.\nTo begin we recall the classical result, which follows\nfrom Eq. (1)26 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03a92\nh\u0304T2\n,\n(28)\n=\nQC\n2U 1 + \u03a92 T1 T2\n\n3.\n\nLoss tangent\n\nWe now consider the loss tangent, i.e. the behavior of\nthe resonator loss 1/Q where Q is the quality factor, as\na function of hn(0)i, the initial average photon number.\nTypically modelling dielectric loss requires including the\nloss model for many TLSs, due to a distribution in \u2206\narising from the amorphous nature of the material. This\nprocedure is usually performed by averaging the solutions\n\nwith the classical Rabi frequency given by\n\u03a9=\n\np cos \u03b8\u22060 F0\n,\n2h\u0304E\n\n(29)\n\nwhere F0 (6= F0\u2032 ) is the amplitude of the classical electric\nfield. In this model saturation of the loss occurs at the\ncritical Rabi frequency given by \u03a9c = (T1 T2 )\u22121/2 , which\nimplies, via Eq. (29), a critical electric field\nFc =\n\n2h\u0304E\n\u221a\n.\np cos \u03b8\u22060 T1 T2\n\n(30)\n\nFor a proper comparison to the quantum results the\nclassical field should be equated to the expectation value\nof the quantum field operator [see Eq.

(32) models a\nsteady state measurement of the loss when the resonator\nis driven so as to ensure hn(t)i \u2261 hn(0)i.\nNow we turn to the results of the quantum theory,\nkeeping in mind that there is no drive in our theory.\nWhen the TLS is unsaturated, the photon number decay is exponential, and the loss tangent may be defined\nas h\u1e45i = \u2212\u03c9hni/Q, or\n\n1000\n\n\u0393\n.\n\u03c9\n\n(35)\n\n2\nFor very weak coupling, Q\u22121\nR\u226a1 \u2243 2g T2 /\u03c9, which reproduces the classical result of Eq. (32) with R(0) \u226a 1.\nWhen the TLS is saturated the photon number decay\nis not exponential. In this case we find that the overall\ndecay is typically dominated by the linear regime, especially for hn(0)i \u226b 1 (see Fig. 3). Using Eq. (27),\n\n1\n1\n=\n,\nQR\u226b1\n2hn(0)iT1 \u03c9\n\n(36)\n\nwhich agrees with the classical result of Eq. (32) for\nR(0) \u226b 1, reproducing in particular the inverse scaling\nof loss with energy [\u221d hn(0)i\u22121 ].\nFrom the above analysis we may expect the onset of\nTLS saturation to occur at a critical number of quanta\nnw given by the intersection of the unsaturated [Eq.

When pure dephasing\nis included, our results do not agree exactly with the\nqubit-resonator predictions of reference 9.

(26) respectively.\nHowever we note two aspects with respect to which the\nstrong coupling dynamics differs from that in the weak\ncoupling case. First, superposed on the overall decay of\nphoton number and saturation of the TLS are oscillations\nof small amplitude which occur at early times as coherent\ntransients, and later as revivals familiar to the JCM30 .\nSecond, saturation of the TLS does not occur at R(t) \u2243\n1, in contrast to the case of weak coupling as discussed\nbelow.\n\n3.\n\nLoss tangent\n\nAlthough the qualitative shape of the loss tangent is\nsimilar to that of weak coupling, as can be seen from\nFig. 5 and Fig. 6 there are crucial physical differences\nbetween the two. First, the asymptotic value for strong\ncoupling when the TLS is unsaturated is found from the\nanalytic solution of Eqs. (12), (14) and (38) to be\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n. (42)\n+\n+\n=\nQn\u226ans\n3\u03c9 T1\nT2\n\u03c9 2T1\n3T\u03c6\nOur prediction, Eq. (42), indicates that for large g, the\nclassical theory overestimates the loss in the unsaturated\nregime. Furthermore the result of Eq. (42) can be used\nto show straightforwardly that the quantum theory predicts a much greater loss in the unsaturated regime for\nlarge g (strong coupling) than for small g (weak coupling). Physically, this is reasonable \u2013 loss is higher for\nthe resonator when it is strongly coupled to the TLS.\nComparing Eq. (42) to Eq. (25) we see that the pure dephasing plays opposite roles in the two cases : loss in the\nweak coupling case decreases with pure dephasing while\nit increases for strong coupling. In the saturated-regime\nall theories coincide, and follow Eq. (36), which holds\nfor strong as well as weak coupling. The loss curves are\nshown as a function of the dimensionless electric field of\nEq. (33) in Fig. 6, from which it can be seen that although\nthe saturation photon number for strong coupling is lower\nthan for weak coupling (Fig. 5), the critical electric field\nat which saturation occurs is higher (Fig. 6).\nLastly, from the above considerations the crossover between the two regimes can be estimated to occur at a\n\ncritical photon number ns given by the intersection of\nthe unsaturated [Eq. (42)] and saturated [Eq. (36)] loss\nasymptotes,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n3\nT1\nns =\n1+\n.\n(43)\n2\nT2\nWe note that Eq. (43) is valid for very strong coupling,\ng \u226b 1/T1 , 1/T2 . This explains the absence of g from\nEq. (43) : deep in the strong coupling regime g is responsible for the reversible dynamics, while loss arises from\nirreversible processes. This argument also implies that\nthe dimensionless quantity ns can then only depend on\nthe ratio T1 /T2 as verified by the final formula; for a large\nT1 the resonator easily saturates the TLS and a small T2\nimplies that the coherent oscillations via which the TLS\nreturns quanta to the resonator are quickly dephased. In\nthe absence of pure dephasing (T2 = 2T1 ) saturation begins to turn on at ns = 1; for T2 < 2T1 , ns < 1. However,\nsince it is difficult to transiently saturate the TLS with\nhn(0)i \u226a 1, ns does not take arbitrarily low values. A\nnumerical search yields the bound\nns,min \u2265 1/2.\nV.\n\n(44)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have quantized the classical model for dielectric\nloss in superconducting resonators due to two level charge\nfluctuators, arriving thus at the Jaynes-Cummings model\nof quantum optics. For both the strong and weak coupling scenarios of this model we have identified regimes\ncorresponding to nonsaturation and saturation respectively of the TLS. We have found that the quantum theory agrees with the classical in the regime of weak coupling. However for strong coupling, we find the quantum\ntheory prescribes a substantially greater loss than the\nclassical. Moreover, the photon number at which TLS\nsaturation occurs is independent of the resonator-TLS\ncoupling in the strong coupling quantum theory, in complete contrast to the classical theory.\nThe numerical and analytical results presented in this\npaper can be used as a starting point for including further\nparameters in the loss model in order to make it more\nrealistic, such as an external drive for the resonator, intrinsic resonator loss, and reservoirs at non-zero temperature. In addition, we have in this work only considered\nthe situation where the resonator is resonant with the\nTLS. The case of non-zero detuning is of interest since experiments typically include a distribution of many TLSs\nwith varying detunings. Usually distributions in the variables of orientation (\u03b8), energy (\u2206) and tunneling barriers (\u22060 ) also need to be considered in order to reach\nagreement with experiment16 . Clearly there can be several additional regimes of behavior of the quantum loss\nmodel, depending on the relative values of the parameters\nintroduced. While working in the time domain serves to\nillustrate the dynamics clearly, working in the frequency\n\n\f9\ndomain can yield additional insights, and is relevant to\nsome experiments; such a project is envisioned for the\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nM.
