We describe our NLTE codes which allow the computation of\nsynthetic spectra of hot stars and accretion disks. They can be combined\nto compute ionizing fluxes from the hot component in symbiotic stars.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSymbiotic stars are interacting binaries with a relatively large separation when\ncompared to cataclysmic variables. Their orbital periods are of the order of\nmonths up to many decades. Symbiotic binaries consist of a cool giant star and\na hot ionizing radiation source (see e.g. Kenyon 2001). The giant looses mass\nby a wind and not by Roche-lobe overflow (M\u00fcrset & Schmid 1999) at a rate\nof typically 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Only a few percent of this amount is accreted by the\ncompanion. The hot component (in quiescent symbiotics) is in most cases a hot\nwhite dwarf. Two known systems are hard X-ray sources and contain accreting\nneutron stars (Chakrabarty & Roche 1997, Masetti et al. 2002). It is not clear\nif an accretion disk is present in all systems. The possible formation of stable\ndisks is supported by hydrodynamic simulations (Mastrodemos & Morris 1998,\nDumm et al. 2000).\nThe observed high luminosity of the hot component is generated by mass\naccretion from the giant wind. An accretion rate of \u1e40 \u2248 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 onto a\nwhite dwarf yields a luminosity of 100 L\u2299 . It is believed that hydrogen shell\nburning of the accreted material can be sustained above the white dwarf core and\nin this case \u1e40 \u2248 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is sufficient to generate that amount of luminosity.\nThe white dwarf is dominating the hot component in those symbiotics\nwhere steep UV continua are observed. The derived white dwarf parameters\nare R \u2248 0.1 R\u2299 , M = 0.5\u20131 M\u2299 , and the effective temperatures range between\nTeff = 30 000 up to 200 000 K (see e.g. M\u00fcrset et al. 1991). The accretion disk is\nprobably dominant in about 10% of the systems with flat UV continua (Kenyon\n2001). The disk temperature reaches 100 000 K at the inner boundary layer and\ndecreases outwards.\nIt is obvious that the analysis of emission line spectra from symbiotic stars\nrequires a realistic modeling of the white dwarf and the disk. Occasionally, the\ncollision of winds from the white dwarf and the disk as well as jets can contribute\n1\n\n\f2\n\nWerner et al.\n\nsignificantly to the ionizing radiation. In the following we present our approach\nto calculate synthetic spectra of the hot component. In Sect. 2. we describe\nthe construction of white dwarf and neutron star NLTE model atmospheres,\nassuming planar geometry and hydrostatic equilibrium. Then we present our\nmethod to compute NLTE disk models, which assume a radial Keplerian \u03b1-disk\nstructure and a detailed vertical structure (Sect. 3.). Up to now we are neglecting\nstellar winds and disk winds. We also disregard jets which are observed in some\nsymbiotics and which could result from outbursts, disk instabilities, or very high\naccretion rates.\n2.\n\nStellar Atmosphere Models\n\nOur computer code calculates plane-parallel, hydrostatic NLTE models in radiative equilibrium. It uses an Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) technique and\nit is described in detail by Werner & Dreizler (1999) and Werner et al. (2002).\nThe code solves self-consistently the equations of radiation transfer, hydrostatic\nand radiative equilibrium, particle conservation, and the NLTE rate equations\nfor the atomic levels populations. Full NLTE line blanketing is possible. Iron\ngroup elements are included by a statistical approach (superlevels and -lines)\nand an opacity sampling method. Basic input parameters are Teff , log g , and\nthe chemical composition. The code computes the atmospheric structure and an\nemergent spectrum. It is routinely used for the spectral analysis in the X-ray to\nIR spectral regions of many objects: Central stars of planetary nebulae, white\ndwarfs, and subdwarfs. For white dwarfs element diffusion strongly affects the\n(E)UV flux, however, this is unimportant for accreting white dwarfs because of\nthe short diffusion time scales. This process could only play a role when accretion were shut off over a period of many years. We have successfully computed\nand applied such models (Dreizler & Wolff 1999, Schuh et al. 2002). Some symbiotic systems harbor a magnetic white dwarf. In these cases as well as in the\nsystems with neutron star components the magnetic field affects the emergent\nstellar spectrum. A polarized radiation transfer calculation is possible with an\nextension of our code (Deetjen et al. 2002). We already applied our code to the\nanalysis of UV and X-ray data from symbiotic stars (Jordan et al. 1994, 1996).\nAn extensive grid of stellar fluxes, also relevant for white dwarfs in symbiotic\nsystems, is available from http://astro.uni-tuebingen.de/~ rauch/ (Rauch\n2002). The data have been calculated for photoionization modeling, in particular\nwith the CLOUDY code (Ferland et al. 1998).\n3.\n\nNLTE Accretion Disk Models\n\nA new computer code, that has been developed from the stellar atmosphere code\ndescribed above, calculates disk spectra under the following assumptions (for\nmore details see Nagel et al. (2002) and in this volume). The radial disk structure is computed assuming a stationary, Keplerian, geometrically thin \u03b1-disk\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). This model is fixed by four global input parameters: Stellar mass M\u22c6 and radius R\u22c6 of the accretor, mass accretion rate \u1e40 , and\nthe viscosity parameter \u03b1. For numerical treatment the disk is divided into a\n\n\fModels for the Hot Component in Symbiotic Stars\n\n3\n\nnumber of concentric rings. For each ring with radius R our code calculates the\ndetailed vertical structure, assuming a plane-parallel radiating slab (in analogy\nto a stellar atmosphere).\nIn contrast to a (planar) stellar atmosphere, which is characterized by Teff\nand log g , a particular disk ring with radius R is characterized by the following\ntwo parameters, which follow from the global disk parameters introduced above.\nThe first parameter measures the dissipated and then radiated energy. It can\nbe expressed in terms of an effective temperature Teff :\n4\nTeff\n(R) = 3GM\u22c6 \u1e40 /8\u03c3\u03c0R3 * (1 \u2212 R\u22c6 /R)1/2 .\n\nThe second parameter is the surface mass density M of the disk ring:\nM (R) = [1 \u2212 (R\u22c6 /R)1/2 ] \u1e40 /3\u03c0 w\u0304.\n\u03c3 and G are the Stefan-Boltzmann and gravitational constants, respectively. w\u0304\nis the depth mean of viscosity w(z), where z is the height above the disk midplane. The viscosity is given by the standard \u03b1-parametrization as a function of\nthe total (i.e. gas plus radiation) pressure, but numerous other modified versions\nare used in the literature. We use a formulation involving the Reynolds number,\nas proposed by Kriz & Hubeny (1986) and Hubeny & Hubeny (1998).\nThe radiation transfer equations plus vertical structure equations are then\nsolved like in the stellar atmosphere case, but accounting for two basic differences. First, the gravitational acceleration (entering the hydrostatic equation)\nis not constant with depth, but increases with z. This is simply the vertical\ncomponent of the gravitational acceleration exerted by the central object (selfgravitation of the disk is negligible):\ng = z GM\u22c6 /R3 .\nSecond, the energy equation for radiative equilibrium balances the dissipated\nmechanical energy and the net radiative losses:\n3\n\n9/4 \u03c1w GM/R = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n(\u03b7\u03bd \u2212 \u03ba\u03bd J\u03bd )d\u03bd,\n\nwhere \u03c1, \u03b7, \u03ba, J denote mass density, opacity, emissivity and mean intensity,\nrespectively. In the case of a stellar atmosphere the left-hand side of this equation\nvanishes and we get the usual radiative equilibrium equation.\nThe total observed disk spectrum, which depends on the inclination angle,\nis finally obtained by intensity integration over all rings accounting for rotational\nDoppler effects.\n4.\n\nSummary and Outlook\n\nWe have modeling tools at hand which can be used to calculate ionizing spectra\nof the hot component in symbiotic stars. We can compute synthetic spectra\nemerging from the white dwarf (or neutron star) and from the accretion disk.\nOur immediate aim for the near future is the inclusion of irradiation effects of the\nstellar spectrum onto the disk. We also want to include effects of a disk wind\nonto the emergent spectrum. Wind models for the compact star are already\navailable (see e.g. Jordan et al. 1996) and must be utilized at least for analyses\nof those symbiotic systems where hot stellar winds are observed (Schmid 2000).\n\n\f4\n\nWerner et al.\n\nAcknowledgments.
