For example, the fundamental limit on the atom\nSagnac gyroscope signal-to-noise ratio is a factor of 1011\ngreater than its optical counterpart, given comparable enclosed\nareas and particle flux. Unlike their photon counterparts,\nhowever, atoms can be sensitive to electric and magnetic\nfields. In this respect, atom interferometry may be suited to a\nsubstantially larger set of sensor applications, though by the\nsame token, it is sensitive to a larger variety of detrimental\nnoise sources. Atom interferometry has been demonstrated\nusing both normal atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. On\nbalance, atom interferometry experiments have revealed\npromising and sometimes stunning measurement capabilities\n[1\u20135].\nEfforts to incorporate interferometry on an \"atom chip\" [6\u2013\n9] are motivated by the large physical size of a traditional\napparatus and a desire to better tailor interferometer\ngeometries. Most attempts to implement a coherent\nbeamsplitter/recombiner on a chip have used current-induced\nmagnetic fields, typically forming double potential wells that\nmerge and then split apart either in space, in time, or in both.\nVarious technical issues, such as noise coupled into the\ncurrent and roughness or impurities of the wires, have stymied\nattempts to demonstrate on-chip interference [10\u201313].\nThis work reports the demonstration of an on-chip atom\nMichelson interferometer employing a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC). An intrawaveguide optical standing wave\nserves to split, reflect, and recombine the BEC. We introduce\na differential phase shift between the two arms of the\ninterferometer that modulates the atom interference. This\ndifferential phase shift is introduced by a magnetic field\ngradient and alternatively by an initial condensate velocity in a\ntrap with a longitudinal frequency of 5 Hz. We observe\ninterference when the round-trip propagation time is relatively\nshort, i.e., less than about 10 ms and the maximum separation\nof the split wave packets is about 120 \u03bcm. The maximum\nseparation is greater than the results reported previously for\nconfined atom interferometers [14, 15].\nOur atom chip contains lithographically patterned wires and\na pair of prism-shaped mirrors, as shown in Fig. 1. The wires\ngenerate magnetic fields that are essential for the microtrap\nand magnetic waveguide. The inward-facing surfaces of the\ntwo prisms are mirror-coated and aligned to produce optical\nstanding waves. A 180-\u03bcm-high tunnel is created underneath\n\nthe prism located at the entrance side of the chip to allow for\nloading of the microtrap.\n(a)\n\nMirrors\n\nTunnel\n\nStanding\nlight wave\n\nWires\n\nLanding region Trapping and splitting region\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1. (a) Schematic drawing of the atom chip (not to scale). The\nprism-shaped mirrors are integrated with microfabricated wires on an\naluminum nitride substrate. The dimensions of the whole chip are 5\ncm by 2 cm. (b) A photo image of the atom chip glued onto a copper\nholder.\n\nA cold cloud of 87 Rb in the F = 1, m f = \u22121 state is\ncollected and precooled in adjoining vacuum chambers to\naround 0.45 \u03bcK [16]. The cloud is delivered through the\ntunnel and captured in the chip's trapping region, which is\nlocated between the prisms and sits 115 \u03bcm away from the\nsurface of the chip. After the cloud is loaded onto the chip, the\ntrapping currents are reduced to place the cloud to 250 \u03bcm\naway from the surface. Next, rf-forced evaporative cooling is\nused to form a condensate. The frequencies of the magnetic\n\n\ftrap in which the condensate is made are 177 Hz in the radial\nand 10 Hz in the axial direction. Once a condensate is formed,\nthe axial confinement is ramped down in 100 ms to release the\ncondensate to the waveguide.\nA tightly focused, linearly polarized laser beam with a waist\nof 110 \u03bcm is incident on and reflected by the mirror that is\noriented at 45 degrees with respect to the chip surface [see\nFig. 1]. The reflected beam is perpendicular to the surface of\nthe chip and is parallel to the direction of the waveguide. The\nbeam is retroreflected by the second mirror that is\nperpendicular to the waveguide and the surface of the chip.\nThe wave vector of the standing-wave light field needs to be\nparallel to the waveguide to minimize radial excitations of the\nBEC from photon scatterings. The prisms must be aligned\nwith respect to the waveguide to better than 2 degrees.\nAn interferometric measurement involves three standingwave light pulses: a splitting pulse, a reflection pulse, and a\nrecombining pulse. The frequency of the standing-wave light\nfield is 7.8 GHz red detuned from the atomic resonance to\nminimize spontaneous emission. The condensate cloud begins\nat rest in the guide. The splitting pulse actually consists of a\npair of subpulses, and each single subpulse diffracts atoms\nlike an optical diffraction grating in the Raman-Nath regime.\nAs a result the cloud is diffracted into different momentum\nstates. The momentum of the atoms diffracted into the nth\norder is changed by \u00b12nhk , where n is an integer number and\nk is the wave number of the photons [17].\nIn general, a single light pulse excites several different\ndiffraction orders, which implies a coupling efficiency less\nthan 100% into a particular order. To achieve a nearly ideal\n50/50 splitting ratio, we have developed the double subpulse\nscheme [18]. The condensate starts at rest. Then the first pulse\ncouples some of atoms into the p = \u00b12hk state while the\nothers stay in the p = 0 state. The phases of atoms with\ndifferent momenta evolve at different rates before the second\npulse mixes them again. The phase evolution of atoms in the\np = \u00b12hk state is faster than that of the ones in the p = 0\nstate. The differential phase shift between the atoms can be\nwritten as \u2206\u03c6 = 4\u03c9 r \u2206t , where \u03c9 r = hk 2 / 2m is the recoil\nfrequency, m is the mass of atoms, and the \u2206t is the delay\nbetween the raising edges of the two pulses. Atoms in the\ndifferent momentum states interfere as the second subpulse\nmixes them again. If the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 is a multiple of\n2\u03c0 , which corresponds to the delay \u2206t = n\u03c0 / 2\u03c9 r between\nthe two pulses, most atoms will populate in the p = \u00b12hk\nstate. On the other hand, if the phase difference is (2n + 1)\u03c0 ,\nwhich corresponds to the delay \u2206t = (2n + 1)\u03c0 / 4\u03c9 r , most\natoms will remain in the zero momentum state after the double\npulse. The contrast ratio of this interferometric splitting can be\nmade 100% by optimizing the power and the length of the\npulses [18]. In our experiment, splitting of the atoms into the\np = \u00b12hk states, with nearly zero population in the p = 0\nor p = \u00b14hk state, can be achieved; we find optimum\nsplitting when the two pulses are both 20 \u03bcs in duration with\npower around 5.5 \u03bcW and the delay between the two pulses is\n63 \u03bcs. The atoms in the different momentum states are\ndetected by absorption imaging when the wave packets are\nspatially separated after 10 ms propagation.\nA reflection pulse is used to reverse the direction of\npropagation of the two wave packets simultaneously. The\npulse is chosen to be 150 \u03bcs in duration with power 6.2 \u03bcW.\nThis relatively long pulse reverses the momenta of the wave\n\npackets through a Bragg scattering process [17]. In response\nto the reflection pulse, the clouds turn around and propagate\nback toward their origin.\nsurface\n\n(a)\n\np=0\n(b)\n\np=-2hk\n\np=2hk\n\np=2hk\n\np=-2hk\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nFIG. 2. (a) The beamsplitter pulse is turned on at t=0. (b) The\ncondensate is split into two wave packets that propagate in the\nopposite direction at 0<t<T/2. (c) The reflection pulse is turned on at\nt=T/2. (d) The wave packets propagate back toward to the center of\nthe waveguide at T/2<t<T. (e) The recombining pulse is turned on at\nt=T when the clouds are overlapped.\n\nUpon the return to their origin, a second pair of splitting\npulses serves to recombine the two condensate clouds. The\nschematic drawings in Fig. 2 show the whole sequence of\nsplitting, reflecting, and recombining the condensate atoms by\nusing standing-wave light fields. Like a simple optical\nbeamsplitter/recombiner, our atom recombiner has two output\nports. The first output port is represented by atoms having\nzero momentum while the second port is represented by atoms\nhaving p = 2hk . Since the splitting and recombining occur\nat the same spatial location, our atom interferometer is\nanalogous to an optical Michelson interferometer. The relative\nphase shift between the two counterpropagating wave packets\nwill change the fractional number of atoms in the two output\nports. If the potential is perfectly symmetric, the relative phase\nshift should be zero, and the atoms should all be in the zero\nmomentum state, as shown in Fig. 3(a). On the other hand, if\nthe waveguide potential is not symmetric, the nonzero relative\nphase shift should lead to the presence of atoms in the\np = \u00b12hk state. In a special case where the relative phase\nshift is \u03c0, the number of atoms in the p = 0 state should be\nnearly zero due to destructive interference, and all the atoms\nwill appear in p = \u00b12hk state, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The\n\n\fpopulations in the two momentum states are anticorrelated\nsince the total number is conserved.\n(a)\n\np = -2hk p = 0 p = 2hk\n\n(b)\n\np = -2hk p = 0\n\np = 2hk\n\n220 mm\nFIG. 3. Interference pattern of (a) phase shift = 2n\u03c0 and (b) phase\nshift = (2n+1)\u03c0. The absorption images are taken 10 ms after the\nrecombining pulse.\n\nTo demonstrate interference, a differential phase shift is\nintroduced by a magnetic gradient while the two wave packets\nare spatially separated after the splitting pulse.

The magnetic gradient is\nprovided by a single wire that is perpendicular to the\nwaveguide and 3.6 mm away from its center. The interference\ndue to the change of the magnetic gradient is shown in Fig.\n4(a). The total propagation time of condensates in the\nwaveguide is 1 ms, and the time between each pulse is 0.5 ms.\nThe magnetic gradient is switched on 0.25 ms before the\nreflection pulse for a duration of 0.5 ms. The maximum\nseparation of the two clouds is around 12 \u03bcm, which is small\ncompared to the full width at half maximum of the cloud size,\n~100 \u03bcm. The periodicity of the interference can be changed\nby varying the timing of the magnetic gradient pulse, which\nchanges the separation of the clouds when the magnetic\ngradient is turned on. The result of the interference with the\nmagnetic gradient switched on 0.05 ms before the reflection\npulse is also shown in Fig. 4(b). The maximum contrast ratio\nshown in the figure is as large as 100%.\nInterference is also observed after 10 ms propagation in the\nwaveguide. An initial velocity of the condensate is created in\nthe trap with a longitudinal frequency of 5 Hz, and the\ndifferential phase shift is observed by changing the total\npropagation time in the waveguide. The result of the\ninterference is shown in Fig 5. The best contrast ratio of the\ninterference at 10 ms, with maximum separation of the two\nclouds of about 120 \u03bcm, is 20%. The contrast ratio drops\nrapidly as we increase the propagation time in the waveguide.\nWe attribute this reduction of the contrast to the dispersion of\nthe wave packets. The dispersion might arise from atom-atom\ninteraction, an inhomogeneous guiding potential, or a nonzero\ncurvature of the applied magnetic gradient; this topic requires\nfurther study.\n\np = 2hk\nN/Ntot\n\nN/Ntot\n\n(a)\n\nt2 \u03bc\nB \u2032(t )\u2206x(t )\n\u2206H\ndt = \u222b Rb\ndt ,\nh\nt1 h\nt1\n\nt2\n\n\u2206\u03c6 mag = \u222b\n\np=0\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\nMagnetic gradient [G/cm]\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4.

Interference fringes after about 10 ms propagation in the\nwaveguide.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated an on-chip atom\nMichelson interferometer. This is the first on-chip observation\nof atom interference between external states. The coherence of\nthe wave packets has been observed up to 10 ms in the\n\n\fwaveguide with a corresponding contrast ratio of 20%. The\ncontrast ratio needs to be improved for a future interferometer\ndesign in which the cloud propagates for longer distances. The\noptical technique for splitting, reflecting, and recombining the\ncondensates enables us to study decoherence effects that may\naffect coherent atom-chip devices in general.\nThe authors would like to thank P.
