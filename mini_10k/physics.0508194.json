The hierarchy in the second hierarchical society is\nstronger than the hierachy in a no-preference society studied by Bonabeau et al\n[ Physica A217, 373 (1995)]\n\nPACS: 05.65.+b, 05.70.Fh, 64.60.Cn, 68.18.Jk\nKeywords: self-organization, hierarchy, phase transition\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe emergence of hierarchies is a common phenomenon in societies and animal groups.\nIn a pioneering work, Bonabeau et al.[1] have shown that a hierarchical society can\nemerge spontaneously from an equal society by a simple algorithm of fighting between\nindividuals diffusing on a square lattice. On the basis of results of Monte Carlo simulation and an analysis by a mean field theory, they concluded that subcritical or\nsupercritical bifurcations exist in the formation of the hierarchical structure as the\ndensity of individuals is varied. In their model, each individual is assumed to have\nsome wealth or power which increases or decreases by winninng or losing in a fight.\nThe essential processes of the model are diffusion, fighting and spontaneous relaxation\nof the wealth. Various societies can be modelled by specifying each process and the\nemergence of the hierarchy depends strongly on the specifications.[2, 3]\nIn this paper, we investigate a variation of the model introduced by Bonabeau et\nal.[1], where the diffusion algorithm is modified to include the effect of the trend of\nsociety. Namely, we study the emergence of hierarchies in a timid society, in which\nan individual always tries to avoid fighting and to fight with the weakest among the\nneighbors if he/she cannot avoid fighting. By Monte Carlo simulation, we show that\nthe emergence of the hierarchy is retarded in the timid society compared to the nopreference society investigated by Bonabeau et al. and that the transition to the\n\n1\n\n\fhierarchical state occurs in two successive transitions of a continuous and a discontinuous ones. Consequently, there exist three different states in the society, one equal\nand two hierarchical states. In the first hierarchical states, we see no winners but\nlosers and people in the middle class. In the second hierarchical states, many winners\nemerge from the middle class. We also show that the distribution of wealth in the second hierarchical state is wider compared to the hierarchical state of the no-preference\nsociety.\nIn Sec. 2, our model is explained in detail. Results of Monte Carlo simulation are\npresented in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 the characteristics of the hierarchical states is analyzed\nin detail. Section 5 is devoted to discussion.\n\n2\n\nA timid society\n\nWe consider N individuals diffusing on an L \u00d7 L square lattice, where every lattice\nsite accomodates at most one individual. An individual is to move to one of nearest\nneighbor sites according to the following protocol. When individual i tries to move to a\nsite occupied by j, i and j fight each other. If i wins, i and j exchange their positions,\nand if i loses, they keep their original positions. We associate each individual a quantity\nwhich we call power or wealth. The power increases by unity for every victory and\ndecreases by unity for every loss. The probability Qij that i wins the fight against j is\ndetermined by the difference of their powers Fi and Fj as\nQij =\n\n1\n,\n1 + exp[\u03b7(Fj \u2212 Fi )]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is introduced as a controlling parameter. When \u03b7 = \u221e, the stronger one\nalways wins the fight and when \u03b7 = 0, the winning probability of both ones are equal.\nWe also assume that the power of individuals relaxes to zero when they do not fight,\nnamely power Fi (t + 1) at time t + 1 is given by Fi (t) through[1]\nFi (t + 1) = Fi (t) \u2212 \u03bc tanh[Fi (t)].\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the unit of time is defined by one Monte Carlo step during which every individual\nis accessed once for move and \u03bc represents an additional controlling parameter. This\nrelaxation rule indicates that people lose their wealth of a constant amount when their\npower is large, and when their power is small, they lose it at a constant fraction,\nnamely they behave rather miserly. It also indicates that the negative wealth (debt)\ncan relax to zero in the similar manner. Note that this rerlaxation rule is critical to\nthe emergence of hierarchical society.[2]\nWe characterize the timid society by the preference of individuals in diffusion. In\nthe timid society, every individual favors not to fight and thus it moves to a vacant\nsite if it exists. If no vacant sites exist in the nearest neighbors, then it moves to a site\noccupied by an individual whose power is the smallest among the neighbors. When\nmore than two neighbors have the equal power, then an opponent is chosen randomly\nfrom them.\nWe characterize the static status of the society by an order parameter \u03c3 which is\ndefined by[1, 2]\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 X\nDi\n1 2\n\u03c32 =\n.\n(3)\n\u2212\nN i Di + S i 2\n2\n\n\fHere, N is the number of individuals, and Di and Si are the number of fights won and\nlost, respectively, by individual i. Note that \u03c3 = 0 corresponds to an egalitarian status\n\u221a\ni\nis distributed uniformly\nand \u03c3 = 1/ 12 \u2243 0.2887 when the chance for victory D D\ni + Si\nin [0, 1]. After sufficiently long Monte Carlo simulation, variation of \u03c3 is stabilized and\none can use it as an order parametrer.\nWe also monitor the population profile by focusing on the winning probability. We\nclassify individuals into three groups by the number of fights which an individual won;\nwinners are individuals who won more than 2/3 of fights and losers are individuals who\nwon less than 1/3 of fights. Individuals between these groups are called middle class.\n\n3\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\n\nMonte Carlo simulation was performed for N = 3500 individuals on the square lattice\nwith periodic boundary conditions from L = 60 to L = 180. We obtained the order\nparameter \u03c3 2 and other quantities for 106 Monte Carlo steps.\n0.16\n0.14\n0.12\n\n\u03c32\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03c1\n\nFigure 1: Order parameter \u03c3 2 as a function of \u03c1 = N/L2 with \u03bc = 0.1, for four different\nvalues of \u03b7: \u03b7 = 50(\u2737), 0.5(\u00d7), 0.05( ), 0.005(\u25b3). Error bars are much smaller than\nthe size of symbols.\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of the order parameter \u03c3 2 on the density \u03c1 = N/L2\nfor several values of \u03b7, where \u03bc is fixed to \u03bc = 0.1. We can see two clear transitions;\none at a lower critical density \u03c1C1 and the other at a higher critical density \u03c1C2 .\nThe transition at \u03c1C1 is continuous and the transition at \u03c1C2 is discontinuous. The\ndependence of the critical densities \u03c1C1 and \u03c1C2 on parameter \u03b7 is shown in Fig. 2.\nWe can identify three states for a given value of \u03b7; an egalitarian state for \u03c1<\u03c1C1 ,\na hierarchical society of type I for \u03c1C1 <\u03c1<\u03c1C2 and a hierachical society of type II for\n\u03c1C2 <\u03c1<1. In the egalitarian society, winners and losers lose their memory of previous\nfight before they engage in the next fight, and thus they changes their status in time.\n3\n\n\f0.75\n0.7\n\n\u03c1C2\n\n0.65\n0.6\n\n\u03c1C1\n\n0.55\n0.5\n0.45\n0.4\n0.35\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\n\u03b7\n\nFigure 2: The dependence of the critical densities \u03c1C1 (the circles) and \u03c1C2 (the crosses)\non parameter \u03b7, where \u03bc = 0.1. The curves are the guide for eyes.\nIn the hierarchical state, a winner keeps winning and a loser keeps losing. We discuss\nthe difference between type I and type II hierarchical society in the next section.\nThe results strongly depend on \u03bc. We show the phase boundary on the \u03c1-\u03bc plane\nfor \u03b7 = 0.05 in Fig. 3.\n\n4\n\nTwo hierarchical societies\n\nIn order to investigate the structure of the hierarchical states, we analyze profile of\npopulation. The dependence of the population of each class is plotted against the\ndensity in Fig. 4. Rapid changes of the populations signify emergence of different state\nof the hierarchical societies. In the egalitarian state \u03c1<\u03c1C1 , all individuals belong to\nthe middle class as expected. In the hierachical society I \u03c1C1 <\u03c1<\u03c1C2 , some individuals\nbecome losers whose number increases as the density is increased, but no winners are\nseen. In the hierachical state II \u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1C2 , many winners appear and the population in\nthe middle class is reduced significantly.\nFigures 5 (a), (b) and (c) show the spacial distribution of individuals after 106\nMonte Carlo steps in the egalitarian, the first hierarchical and the second hierarchical\nstates, respectively. No specific spatial inhomogeneity is observed in the timid society.\nIn order to see details of the hierarchical structure, we plot the population as a\nfunction of the density and the winning probablity in Fig. 6. From this plot, we\nconclude that (1) in the hierarichical state I, people in the middle class with slightly\nhigher winning probability increase, but no winners are seen and (2) in the hierarchical\nstate II, the most of winners have very high winning probability, while people in the\nlosers and the middle class are distributed in a wide region of the winning probability,\n\n4\n\n\f0.9\n\n\u03c1C2\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n\u03c1C1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03bc\n\nFigure 3: The dependence of the critical densities \u03c1C1 (the circles) and \u03c1C2 (the crosses)\non parameter \u03bc for \u03b7 = 0.05. The curves are the guide for eyes.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have investigated the emergence of self-organized hierarchies in the timid society.\nOur results show that the emergence of the hierarchical state in the timid society is\nretarded compared to the no-preference society. This delay is natural since individuals\nin the timid society tend to avoid fighting and thus the wealth is distriruted more or less\nevenly among individuals when the population is low. Furthermore, the emergence of\nthe hierarchical society in the timid society occurs in two steps, and the first transition\nis continuous and the second one is discontinuous. The strength of the hierarchy in\nthe high density region is stronger in the timid society compared to the no-preference\nsociety. For the same choice of \u03b7 = 0.05 and \u03bc = 0.1, \u03c3 2 for the former case is twice as\nlarge as the latter[1].\nTo understand these behaviors, we first remind the fact that the the hierarchical\nsociety emerges when the power cannot relax before the subsequet fight. In the timid\nsociety, an idividual can avoid fighting when the density is low, and thus the ealitarian\nstate is favored for low densities. In the timid society, weaker individuals have more\nchance to be challenged and thus to lose their power, and stronger ones has less chance\nto fight and their power stay near zero. This situation corresponds to the hierarchical\nstate I. When the density is increased above the upper critical density, all individuals\nhave more chance to fight and thus stronger individuals become much stronger.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. Bonabeau, G.
