Two diff erent types of vortex have\nbeen detected. The ou tward vortex fi rst penetrates the particle near its centerline then, on exiting\nthe particle, the flow-lines tu rn away from the centerline and enter a spiral trajectory. O u tward\nvortexes are seen for the wavelengths shorter then the plasmon resonance. For the wavelengths\nlonger that the plasmon resonance the vortex is inward: the power-flow lines pass arou nd the sides\nof the particle before tu rning towards the centerline and entering the particle to begin their spiral\ntrajectory.\n\nThe structures of optical fi elds around metallic nanoparticles are of special interest due to their role\nin nanophotonic and plasmonic devices and metawaveguides [1\u20133]. Here for the fi st time, we report that\nlight interacting with an absorbing metallic nanoparticle follows curly trajectories with curvatures on the subwavelength scale, creating whirlpool-like nanoscale optical vortices. These \"energy sink\" vortices with spiral\nenergy flow line trajectories are seen in the proximity of\nthe nanoparticle's plasmon resonance.\nO ptical vortices have been identifi ed as features\nin scalar wavefront dislocations of monochromatic\nlight fi elds and modal lines corresponding to nonmonochromatic light as well as in singularities in the\nmaps representing vectorial properties of light [4]. It is\nnow recogniz ed that singularities are often features of\nfi elds near sub-wavelength structures. A vortex structure in the streamlines of the Poynting vector has been\ndetected for S ommerfeld's edge diff raction with discussion of the eel-like motion of light at the edge dating back\nto Newtonian times [5]. Recently vortices were found in\nlight diff racted by narrow slits in silver and silicon [6, 7].\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, vortex fi eld structures have never been detected in the vicinity of metal\nnanoparticles.\nWe studied the interaction of light with homogeneous\nisotropic spherical nanoparticles using Mie theory [8] -\nan exact analytical wave theory giving time-harmonic\nelectromagnetic fi elds E and H at freq uency \u03c9 that satisfy the wave eq uations\n52 E + k 2 E = 0,\n\n52 H + k 2 H = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k 2 = \u03c9 2 \u03b5\u03bc. S olutions to these eq uations are presented in the form of a series of spherical B essel Functions inside the particle and spherical Hankel functions\noutside it. The nanoparticle is assumed to have a dielectric coeffi cient \u03b5 and permittivity \u03bc. Mie theory gives\nexact solutions of the vector wave eq uation for the internal and scattered fi elds of the particle and has generated\na massive body of literature in which fi eld patterns for\nangle-dependant scattering, modes of excitation, and in-\n\ntegral characteristics such as absorption and scattering\ncross-section have been calculated [9, 10]. It has been\nshown that light can bend near a nanoparticle [11], however it has never been determined that the interaction of\nlight with a nanoparticle can create a nanoscale vortex\nfi eld structure. Here we refer to vortices in the \"trajectory\" of light near the nanoparticle as defi ned by the\nlines of powerflow, i.e. lines to which the Poynting vector P = [E \u00d7 H] is tangential. In the vortex regime of\npropagation the lines of powerflow are wound around the\nnanoparticle to create a nanoscale \"whirlpool\", comparable in siz e to the particle itself, whereby light seems to\npass through the particle several times over.\nWe found that the vortex regime occurs in metallic\n(e.g. silver) nanoparticles in the vicinity of the plasmon\nabsorbtion resonance. We analyz ed the fi eld structure\naround a nanoparticle excited by a plane electromagnetic\nwave. To illustrate the vortex structures graphically, we\nplotted solutions in the plane of polariz ation of the incident light using powerflow lines and a color scale for the\nabsolute value of the Poynting vector (reg = high, blue =\nlow). In the fi eld maps presented below the incident light\nis polariz ed in the plane of the page and propagates from\nleft to right.\nTo relate the parameter fi eld for our calculations to\nobservable values we shall defi ne the dimensionless scattering \u03c3s and absorbtion \u03c3a cross-sections of the nanoparticle. In the Rayleigh approximation, cross-sections\nfor a particle much smaller than the wavelength are introduced via the particle's polariz ability \u03b1 and its geometrical cross-section S: \u03c3s = (k 4 /6\u03c0)|\u03b1|2 /S and \u03c3a =\nkIm(\u03b1)/S \u2212 \u03c3s , where k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb is the wave vector, and\npolariz ability is a function of the particle's shape and\nsiz e [12].\nWe found that the existence of the vortex structure\nand the topology of the fi eld maps depend on the values\nof the real and imaginary parts of the particle's complex\ndielectric coeffi cient \u03b5 = \u03b50 + i\u03b500 (see Fig. 2). Here and\nbelow we assume non-magnetic nanoparticles with \u03bc = 1.\nFigures 2(a) and (b) show the modifi cation of the fi eld\nstructure around a hypothetical nanoparticle for diff erent\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Map showing valu es of the real and imaginary parts\nof the dielectric constant (in red) at which vortex fi eld stru ctu res appear. T he dashed line at \u03b50 \u223c \u22122.2 indicates the\nposition of the plasmon resonance in a spherical nanoparticle with r \u2248 20 nm (\u03bb / r = 20). T he solid lines show the\ndispersion characteristics of the dielectric properties of silver.\n\nvalues of \u03b500 . In the case depicted in Fig. 2(a) the scattering and absorption cross-sections are much smaller than\nthe geometrical cross-section and the particle is almost\ninvisible to the external fi eld (\u03c3a = 0.47, \u03c3s = 0.03).\nM ost of the powerflow lines pass by the nanoparticle and\nonly handful of them terminate on the particle, indicating small losses. In the case depicted in Fig. 2(b) the\nabsorption cross-section approaches the plasmon resonance (\u03c3a = 3.6, \u03c3s = 0.24). M any flow-lines terminate\nat the nanoparticle (entering it from the front and the\nback), indicating high losses. When the absorbtion and\nscattering cross-sections increase even further the flow\nlines create vortex-like structures around the nanoparticle. Figures 2(c) and (d) show such vortices around\na silver nanoparticle at wavelengths of 354 nm (where\n\u03b5 = \u22122.0 + i0.28, \u03c3a = 5.8 and \u03c3s = 1.8) and 367 nm\n(where \u03b5 = \u22122.71 + i0.25, \u03c3a = 4.1 and \u03c3s = 2.0).\nFigure 1 shows the parameter fi eld where vortex structures can be observed. Two diff erent types of vortex have\nbeen seen. In the fi rst type, which we call an outward\nvortex, a bunch of powerflow lines fi rst penetrate the particle near its centerline then, on exiting the particle, they\nseparate, turn away from the centerline and enter a spiral trajectory. O utward vortices are seen to the \"left\"\nof the the plasmon resonance i.e. for \u03b50 > \u22122.2 (in a\nspherical nanoparticle with a radius of 20 nm the plasmon resonance occurs at \u03b50 \u223c \u22122.2). In the second type\nof vortex, which we call an inward vortex, the powerflow\nlines pass around the sides of the particle before turning\ntowards the centerline and entering the particle to begin\ntheir spiral trajectory. O utward vortexes are seen to the\n\"right\" of the the plasmon resonance i.e. for \u03b50 < \u22122.2.\nWe also found by numerical simulation that vortex\nfi elds can exist near non-spherical nano-objects. Nonspherical nanoparticles are of considerable interest for\n\napplications because flattened or elongated shapes tend\nto reduce the plasmon resonance freq uency, moving it\nfrom the blue-UV part of the spectrum to the more accessible visible-IR range. M ie theory is unsuitable for\nobjects without spherical symmetry but computational\nmethods provide an alternative to the analytical approaches and allow consideration of vortex fi elds around\ncomplex nanostructures. To analyz e the vortex fi elds\nnear spheroidal nanoparticles we used 64-bit software,\ndeveloped by C omsol Inc., which implements a true 3D\nfi nite element method [14] and applies Perfectly M atched\nLayer (PM L) [15] boundary conditions on all sides of\nthe computational domain. We investigated a homogeneous oblate spheroidal nanoparticle with an aspect ratio\nof 2. Figure 3 shows the modifi cation of the fi eld structure around a spheroidal nanoparticle for diff erent values of \u03b500 . Here again, one can see the weak interaction\nregime in Fig. 3(a) (\u03c3a = 0.42, \u03c3s = 0.02), the high-loss\nregime in Fig. 3(b) (\u03c3a = 3.7, \u03c3s = 0.3), the creation of\noutward vortexes in Fig. 3(c) (\u03c3a = 8.7, \u03c3s = 2.9), and\nthe creation of inward vortexes in Fig. 3(d) (\u03c3a = 2.9,\n\u03c3s = 1.3).\nThere are a number of intriguing q uestions that may be\nasked in relation to the nanoscale structuring of the energy flow near and inside the nanoparticle. For instance,\na vortex structure with light passing through a nanoparticle several times backwards and forwards, resembles\na standing wave in a dissipative Fabry-Perot resonator.\nO ne may therefore wonder if such a \"nano-resonator\"\ncould provide conditions for a hysteresis and bistability in\nthe nanoparticle's optical response if its dielectric properties depend on the intensity of light. The existence of\nvortex structures in nanoparticles could provide a graphical interpretation of the fact that the absorbtion crosssection of a particle can be much bigger that its geometrical cross-section. When a vortex is created, powerflow\nlines pass through the nanoparticle several times, \"multiplying\" the light-matter interaction and generating the\nhigh energy losses associated with the large optical crosssection.\nThe authors would like to thank M .V.B erry for important comments and useful references and K .F.
