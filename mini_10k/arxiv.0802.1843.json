In\nthe present investigation we perform a statistical characterization of strain\nbursts observed in stress-controlled compressive deformation of monocrystalline Molybdenum micropillars. We characterize the bursts in terms of\nthe associated elongation increments and peak deformation rates, and\ndemonstrate that these quantities follow power-law distributions that do\nnot depend on specimen orientation or stress rate.

We discuss our\nfindings in view of observations of deformation bursts in other materials,\nsuch as face-centered cubic and hexagonal metals.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn microscopic and mesoscopic scales, plastic deformation of crystalline solids\nproceeds as an intermittent series of strain bursts ('slip avalanches'). Indirect\nevidence of such bursts has been provided by systematic acoustic emission (AE)\nstudies of Weiss and co-workers on ice [1, 2], hcp metals [3], and fcc metals\n[4]. These studies indicate that the AE signals of plastically deforming crystals\nconsist of discrete bursts separated by quiescent intervals of low AE activity.\nThe energies E (amplitude square integrated over the duration of a burst) and\n1\n\n\fpeak amplitudes A of the AE bursts exhibit a huge scatter; their statistics is\ncharacterized by scale-free (power law) distributions, with probability density\nfunctions p(E) \u221d E \u2212\u03baE and p(A) \u221d A\u2212\u03baA that are well described as power laws\nwith material-independent exponents \u03baE \u2248 1.5 and \u03baA \u2248 2, extending over up\nto 8 decades with no apparent cut-off.\nDimiduk and co-workers confirmed temporal intermittency of plastic flow by\ndirect observation of strain bursts during compressive deformation of micropillars machined out of Ni single crystals [5]. In these experiments, the elongation\nvs. time curves observed under stress-controlled loading were characterized by\nan intermittent sequence of deformation jumps, with elongation increments \u2206l\nthat exhibited a scale-free distribution p(\u2206l) \u221d \u2206l\u2212\u03bal where \u03bal \u2248 1.5. Recently,\nNgan observed bursts with similar statistical characteristics in creep deformation\nof aluminum micropillars under constant stress conditions [6]. These findings\ncan be directly related to the acoustic emission results if one assumes that a\nfixed fraction of the work done by the external forces during an elongation jump\nis released in the form of acoustic energy.\nTheoretically, the formation of intermittent deformation bursts has been\nmodelled using two-dimensional [7] and three-dimensional [8] discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, as well as various types of continuum models\n[9, 10, 11, 12]. In the discrete simulations, the stochastic nature of the deformation process is directly 'inherited' from the statistical choice of the initial\ndislocation configuration, which in turn reflects the variability of the initial\nmicrostructure of real specimens. In the continuum models, statistical heterogeneity needs to be explicitly incorporated into the constitutive equations, e.g.\nin terms of fluctuations in the local flow stresses or energy dissipation rates.\nWhile less 'realistic' than discrete dislocation simulations, such models provide\na conceptual framework for understanding the origin of the scale-free avalanche\ndynamics which can be related to a depinning-like transition between an elastic and a plastically deforming phase ('yielding transition'). A comprehensive\noverview of experimental and theoretical results has been given by Zaiser [13].\nIn spite of all these investigations, open questions remain. The relations\nbetween different characteristics of strain bursts, such as the associated strain\nor elongation increments, the burst durations and the peak strain rates, have\nremained largely unexplored. Other open issues concern the statistics of stress\nincrements between bursts and the correlation between stress increments and\nburst sizes. Furthermore, practically all the experimental evidence has been\ngathered on materials (fcc and hcp metals, ice close to its melting point) where\nthe motion of dislocations is governed by their mutual interactions. Molybdenum (Mo), on the other hand, is a bcc metal where dislocation interactions with\nthe crystal lattice (Peierls stresses) may have a crucial influence on the deformation behavior: Below the so-called knee temperature (\u223c 500-550 K for Mo\n[14]), the plastic deformation of bulk bcc metals is controlled by the nucleation\nand motion of kinks on screw dislocations. These materials exhibit therefore a\nstrong temperature and strain-rate dependence of the flow stress (for a detailed\noverview of the deformation behavior of bcc metals, see [14, 15]). Since the motion of dislocations is at low temperatures governed by their interactions with\nthe crystal lattice, it has been argued that collective behavior, and hence strain\nbursts, may be suppressed in this temperature regime [4].\nIn the present paper, we adress these open questions by investigating strain\nbursts observed in Molybdenum (Mo) micropillars that are deformed at room\n2\n\n\ftemperature in compression under load control. In the following sections we first\ndescribe the experimental procedure and the methods used for characterizing\nthe strain bursts. We then discuss the results of our analysis in view of the\nstatistics of burst sizes and stress increments, and the relations between burst\nstrain and peak strain rate. We conclude with a comparison of our findings with\ntheoretical and experimental results on strain bursts in other materials.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nExperimental\nSpecimen preparation and mechanical testing\n\nZone refined Mo single crystals were oriented using Laue diffraction, and diskshaped samples of approximately 3 mm height and 10 mm diameter with disk\nnormals pointing along [100] and [235] lattice directions were cut by spark erosion. The disk surfaces were then mechanically polished using 6, 3 and 1 \u03bcm\ndiamond suspensions and subsequently electro-polished for 60 seconds using a\nmixture of 610 ml Methanol and 85 ml H2 SO4 at a current of 1-2 Amperes. The\nsamples were mounted on a custom machined aluminum holder for testing, and\ntheir orientation was confirmed by electron backscatter diffraction.\nThe specific process used in fabricating micropillars from the oriented samples is very similar to the method of Frick et al. [16]. Free-standing pillars\nof tapered shape were fabricated using a dual focused ion beam (FIB) and\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI Nova 600 NanoLab DualBeamTM ).\nThe as-machined pillars were deformed in compression at ambient pressure and\ntemperature by using a MTS XP nanoindenter system equipped with a sapphire\nconical indenter with a flat 10 \u03bcm diameter tip. The loading rates varied between 4 and 60 \u03bcN/sec, depending on pillar diameter. Geometrical parameters\n(top diameter dt , bottom diameter db , and length l of the analysed pillars) and\nloading rates are compiled in Table 1.\nDeformation experiments were performed at a control rate of 500 Hz with\na data storage rate of 25 Hz, i.e., data were recorded at intervals \u2206t = 0.04 s.\nTests were typically performed with two intermediate unloading and reloading\ncycles at about 2.5% and 5% strain in order to observe the linear elastic response\nand transient loading/unloading behavior of the pillars. The intermediate unloading may influence the strain burst statistics: Most of the deformation occurs\nduring the largest bursts (see Figure 1) and it is thus very likely that these are\ntruncated by unloading (in fact, sometimes the burst continued during unloading or burstlike deformation resumed at a reduced stress level upon reloading).\nTherefore, a set of [100] oriented pillars (labelled with the subscript 'nr' in Table\n1) were deformed without intermediate unloading. Analysing these separately\nallows us to assess the influence of unloading on the burst statistics.\nThe flow stresses of the investigated samples increase with decreasing sample\nsize. A study of this size effect has been published elsewhere [17]. Here, we\nfocus exclusively on the intermittent nature of the deformation process. As\ncan be seen from Figure 1, the deformation curves are characterized by an\nirregular sequence of large strain bursts visible as steps on the stress vs. strain\nor elongation vs. time curves. During the bursts, which typically lasted less\nthan a second, deformation rates were high (peak strain rates > 1 s\u22121 ). The\nelongation rate signals have the typical signature of a 'crackling noise' (Figure\n\n3\n\n\f3500\n\nTrue stress [MPa]\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nTrue strain [%]\n\nFigure 1: Stress-strain curves of [100] oriented Mo micropillars [17] (Specimens\n2nr , 5nr , 6nr , 7nr , 9nr , and 10nr in Table 1).\n2) [18], i.e., they are composed of discrete bursts of widely varying magnitude.\n\n2.2\n\nData analysis\n\nStrain bursts were characterized in terms of their size (defined as the elongation\nincrement between the beginning and the end of the burst), duration, and peak\nelongation rate. To define a burst, the elongation vs. time signals l(t) were first\nconditioned by performing a running average over an averaging time interval\n\u2206tav . This served to eliminate high-frequency noise resulting from the deformation setup. The averaged signals l\u0304(t) were then differentiated using a simple\ncentral difference scheme, and the resulting elongation rate signals dt  \u0304l(t) were\nbroken into bursts by thresholding: A strain burst was associated with a time\ninterval [ti1 , ti2 ] such that dt l\u0304(t) > l\u0307thresh for all t \u2208 [ti1 , ti2 ] and dt  \u0304l(t) < l \u0307thresh\nfor t = ti1 \u2212 \u2206t and for t = ti2 + \u2206t. The burst duration was then defined\nas T i := ti1 \u2212 ti2 , the burst elongation as S i = l(ti2 ) \u2212 l(ti1 ), the time-averaged\npeak elongation rate as L\u0307ipav := max [dt  \u0304l(t)] for t \u2208 [ti1 , ti2 ], and the true peak\nelongation rate as L\u0307ip := max [dt l(t)] for t \u2208 [ti1 , ti2 ]. The burst initiation stress\nwas defined as \u03c3 i := \u03c3(ti1 ), and the stress increment as \u2206\u03c3 i := \u03c3 i \u2212 \u03c3 i\u22121 . On\nsome rare occasions, bursts occurred during intermediate unloading or reloading, leading to negative stress increments. These bursts were discarded from\nthe stress increment statistics.\nIn our analysis we used the standard parameters \u2206tav = 0.8 s and l\u0307thresh =\n0.5 nm/s. For these parameters, a typical specimen of 0.5 \u03bcm diameter yielded\nbetween 50 and 100 bursts, most of them small.

Those [100] specimens that were deformed without intermediate stress relaxation are grouped\nseparately such that the influence of intermediate unloading on the strain burst\nstatistics can be assessed. The class partition is shown in Table 1. For the\nbursts obtained from all specimens in a given class, probability distributions\np(S) were determined by logarithmically binning the S i data. This is appropriate for power-law distributed data where logarithmic binning may significantly\nimprove the statistics in the regime of large events without introducing spurious cut-off effects. Stress increments, on the other hand, were found to be\nWeibull distributed. In this case, since the data scatter around a characteristic\nvalue, logarithmic binning makes little sense. Instead, we base our statistical\nanalysis on the cumulative distribution P> (\u2206\u03c3) as determined from the ordered\nsequence of the \u2206\u03c3 i : P> (\u2206\u03c3n ) \u2248 n/(N + 1) where N is the total number of\nstress increments and \u2206\u03c3n the nth member in the descending sequence.\nTo ensure that the burst statistics do not significantly depend on the signal conditioning and thresholding parameters \u2206tav and l \u0307thresh , we performed\na systematic parameter study by varying these parameters in the ranges 0.2 s\n\u2264 \u2206tav \u2264 2.4 s and 0.25 nm/s \u2264 l\u0307thresh \u2264 2.5 nm/s, and studying the corresponding changes in the p(S) probability distribution for 'small' [100] oriented\npillars (class [100]S, Table 1).\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nWe first investigate to which extent the statistics of strain burst sizes is influenced by the parameters used for smoothing and thresholding the raw elongation\nrate signals. Figure 3 shows distributions obtained for 'small' [100] crystals using three different sizes of the averaging window. For short averaging windows,\nthe distribution of burst sizes exhibits two distinct regimes: At small burst sizes,\nthe burst size distribution has a 'hump' which decays exponentially, whereas at\nlarge sizes, the exponential decay is replaced by a power-law tail. We may associate these two regimes with two different physical processes, viz on the one\nhand the high-frequency noise of the deformation setup which produces a large\nnumber of small 'bursts' \u2013 in fact, just irregular oscillations of the deformation\nmachine \u2013 and on the other hand the collective dynamics of the dislocation\nsystem which produces intermittent large bursts of plastic deformation activity\nwith a power-law size distribution. What is important is that the high-frequency\nnoise of the machine does not mask the power-law scaling since the amplitude of\nthe machine-induced elongation fluctuations is limited to values less than 1 nm.\nBy increasing the length of the averaging window, we can suppress this exponential 'hump' while the power-law part of the distribution remains unchanged\n\u2013 in fact, the length of the scaling regime increases and reaches a maximum at\na window length of 0.8 s which we choose as our default value. If the original\nsignal is averaged over even larger times, the size distribution of large bursts\nremains unchanged but the length of the scaling regime decreases again since\nsmaller bursts are 'washed out' as their peak elongation rates fall below the\nthreshold.\nFigure 4 shows the dependence of the burst size distribution on the imposed\nelongation rate threshold. For small thresholds, the distribution is practically\nindependent on threshold, while a threshold substantially above our default\nvalue of 0.5 nm/s eliminates small bursts but leaves the size distribution of\nlarge bursts practically unchanged. Crucially, neither the size of the averaging\nwindow nor the choice of the threshold seem to have any appreciable influence\non the power-law scaling of the burst size distribution in the large-burst regime\n(elongation increments larger than approximately 1 nm). This robustness of\nthe procedure indicates that it is indeed viable to envisage our elongation rate\nsignals as 'crackling noise' composed of discrete events.\nProbability distributions of strain burst sizes for the different specimen\nclasses are shown in Figure 5 (left).

To illustrate this point, we show on the\nright-hand side of Figure 5 simulated p(S) distributions determined from 6 sets\nof surrogate data, each consisting of 400 random numbers drawn independently\nfrom a distribution p(S) \u221d S \u22121.5 . As can be seen, the scatter of the exponents\ndetermined from these sets, the scatter in the data ranges, and the error of the\nlinear least-square fits are all comparable with the corresponding values for the\nexperimental datasets. This illustrates the intrinsic problems encountered in\ndetermining distribution parameters from limited sets of data.\nWe now proceed to investigate other burst characteristics, viz the burst durations and peak elongation rates. Unfortunately, the intrinsic burst durations\nmay be well below the size \u2206tav of our averaging window. As a consequence,\nall large bursts determined from the averaged elongation rate signal have approximately the same duration which is roughly proportional to \u2206tav . Hence,\nthe burst durations as determined from the averaged signals are no longer good\ncharacterizers of the bursts and, for evident reasons, the same is true for the peak\nrates of the time-averaged signals which decrease with increasing \u2206tav . The true\npeak elongation rate L\u0307p , on the other hand, represents an intrinsic property of\nthe bursts that is not affected by time averaging. There is a strong statistical\ncorrelation between L\u0307p and burst size S (correlation coefficient r > 0.9) but it\nit is not easy to establish a clear-cut mathematical relation between the two\nquantities. This is seen from Figure 6 which shows L\u0307p vs. S values for all large\n7\n\n\f2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\np(S) [nm\n\n-1\n\n]\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n\u03ba=1.5\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nthreshold 2.5 nm/s\nthreshold 0.5 nm/s\n\n-5\n\n10\n\nthreshold 0.25 nm/s\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nburst size\n\n1\n\n10\n\nS [nm]\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nFigure 4: Strain burst size distributions for 'small' [100] oriented Mo micropillars (class [100]S in Table 1), determined with different threshold values of the\nelongation rate and a window size of 0.8 s.\nbursts. While part of the observed bursts seem to exhibit peak rates that are\napproximately proportional to the burst sizes (L\u0307p \u221d s, upper straight line in\nFigure 6), other data seem to suggest a proportionality to the square root of the\nburst sizes L\u0307p \u221d S 1/2 , lower straight line in Figure 6). Fitting a power law to all\nthe data yields L\u0307p \u221d S 0.8 which badly represents either group. Interpretation\nof these findings is further complicated by the fact that the two behaviors do\nnot represent different specimen classes \u2013 rather, bursts from one and the same\nspecimen may be found both near the upper and the lower straight lines.\nTo assess the degree of correlation between the burst size and the magnitude\nof the preceding and following stress increments, the respective correlation coefficients were evaluated separately for the 6 datasets in class [100]S, and the mean\ncorrelation coefficient as well as the variance of the r values were determined.\nThe results (r = 0.03\u00b10.24 for the correlation coefficient between burst size and\nmagnitude of the preceding stress increment, and r = 0.11 \u00b1 0.28 for the correlation between burst size and magnitude of the following stress increment) do not\nindicate any statistically significant correlation. There is also no statistically\nsignificant correlation between the sizes of successive bursts (r = 0.02 \u00b1 0.05).\nThe statistics of stress increments differs substantially from the statistics\nof burst sizes: Instead of scale-free power laws we find distributions with a\ncharacteristic scale that depends on specimen size. Figure 7 shows cumulative\ndistributions P> (\u2206\u03c3) (probability to find a stress increment larger than \u2206\u03c3)\nfor the specimen classes [100]S, [100]M, [100]L, and [100]XL.

Parameters for the distributions are shown in the\nlegend; the Weibull modulus m which determines the width of the distribution is\napproximately the same for all distributions, but the stress parameter decreases\nwith increasing specimen size.\nThis is further illustrated in Figure 8 where parameters m and \u2206\u03c30 of stress\nincrement distributions obtained from individual specimens are plotted against\nspecimen size. It is clearly seen that the Weibull moduli m \u2248 0.75 do not depend significantly on specimen size, whereas the stress parameters \u2206\u03c30 (and,\naccordingly, the average stress increments between bursts) decrease approximately in inverse proportion with specimen diameter dt . This implies that, in\nlarger specimens, smaller stress increments are needed to trigger strain bursts\n\u2013 an obvious result since in larger specimens we expect to find a larger number\nof weak regions or sources that can be activated in any given stress interval. A\nmore quantitative analysis is, however, hampered by the fact that the characteristic stress increments depend on the averaging and thresholding parameters\nused in our data analysis: shorter averaging times \u2206tav and smaller threshold\nvalues l \u0307thresh lead to the identification of a larger number of small 'bursts' and\na proportional reduction of the characteristic stress increment \u2206\u03c30 .

For the burst sizes (elongation increments) we find a distribution\np(S) \u221d S \u22121.5 which is in line with experimental findings on Ni micropillars [5]\nas well as theoretical predictions based on continuum and discrete dislocation\nmodels [12]. The same theoretical models predict power-law relationships L\u0307p \u221d\nT \u221d S 1/2 to hold between the peak rate, duration, and size of strain bursts.\nUnfortunately, owing to the need for conditioning the signal by time averaging,\nno useful information about the burst durations could be obtained in the present\ninvestigation, while the information regarding the relationship between burst\nsize and peak elongation rate turned was found to be ambiguous.\nIn line with previous investigations, the power-law characteristics of strain\nbursts seem to be little affected by specimen orientation, size, or imposed deformation rate. While theoretical investigations [8, 19] suggest an intrinsic cut-off\nto the power-law scaling regime, no such cut-off could be identified in our inves11\n\n\ftigation. This may be due to the fact that establishing a cut-off requires good\nstatistics in the region of very large strain bursts, which could not be achieved\nin the present investigation as the total number of bursts obtained from each\nindividual specimen was small (< 100).\nThe distributions of stress increments between subsequent strain bursts differ\nsubstantially from the burst size distributions. Instead of scale-free power laws,\nwe find Weibull distributions with a characteristic stress scale (the stress parameter \u2206\u03c30 ) that decreases approximately in inverse proportion with specimen\nsize. However, the very presence of a characteristic scale makes the distribution\nparameters depend on the number of identified bursts. This dependency raises\nthe problem of distinguishing between the effects of collective dislocation motion\nand the effects of machine noise, which may increase the apparent burst number\nby adding spurious 'bursts' of small size into the statistics. For the same reason, any conclusions based upon the observed lack of correlation between burst\nsizes and strain increments, or between the sizes of subsequent bursts, must be\nregarded with caution.\nOur investigation demonstrates for the first time the occurrence of scale-free\nstrain bursts in a bcc metal deforming below the transition temperature, and\nwe find that the burst characteristics are similar to those in fcc metals. This\nimplies that even a significant Peierls stress, which is of crucial importance for\nthe deformation properties of bulk Mo at ambient tempeature, is not sufficient to\ninhibit burst-like deformation. In this sense, we may conclude that the Peierls\npotential is irrelevant as far as the dynamics and statistics of strain bursts\nare concerned, and that the observed behaviour constitutes a truly universal\nfeature of dislocation plasticity that can be observed in all kinds of crystal\nlattice structures. It may be mentioned that the same is not true for the size\ndependence of the flow stress: The size effects observed in fcc micropillars (for\nreference, see, e.g. [20]) differ substantially from those observed in the present\nsamples [17]. The universality of strain burst behavior is a key result of the\npresent study, and it would be desirable to obtain further corroboration of this\nresult from acoustic emission measurements on bulk bcc metals.\nAcknowledgements: We acknowledge support of the Commission of the\nEuropean Communities under contract NEST-2005-PATH-COM-043386 and of\nEPSRC under Grant No. EP/E029825.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
