Spectacular results from neutrino oscillation experiments have established\nbeyond doubt that neutrinos have mass and they mix [1]. For three neutrino generations the neutrino mass matrix at low energy is characterized by 9 parameters \u2013 the three\nmasses, the three mixing angles and the three phases. The mixing matrix, usually known\nas the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, is expressed in the standard\nparametrization as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b4\nV = \uf8ed\u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4\ns23 c13 \uf8f8 ,\n(1.1)\ni\u03b4\ni\u03b4\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 e\n\u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 e\nc23 c13\nwhere cij and sij stand for cos \u03b8ij and sin \u03b8ij . This matrix is to be multiplied from right\nby a diagonal phase matrix P = diag(1, e\u2212i\u03c1/2 , e\u2212i\u03c3/2 ) where \u03c1 and \u03c3 denote the Majorana\nphases, which disappears if the neutrinos are Dirac particles. Oscillation experiments, so far\nhave determined the two mass squared differences and two mixing angles and have provided\nan upper bound on the third mixing angle. The current data specify the 3\u03c3 values of the\noscillation parameters as presented in Table 1 [2].\nThus the data show that there are two independent mass scales with \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 | =\n0.032 at the best-fit. Unlike quark sector where all mixing angles are small in the neutrino\nsector there are two large mixing angles while the third one can be small. The solar\nneutrino data have established that \u2206m221 > 0. But the sign of the atmospheric mass scale\n\u2206m231 is not yet known. According to the sign of \u2206m231 the neutrino spectrum can have\ntwo hierarchies, normal hierarchy: m23 \u2243 \u2206m231 \u226b m22 \u2243 \u2206m221 \u226b m21 with \u2206m231 > 0 or\ninverted hierarchy: m22 \u2243 m21 \u2243 |\u2206m231 | \u226b m23 with \u2206m231 < 0. The three neutrinos can\nalso be quasi-degenerate with m23 \u2243 m22 \u2243 m21 \u226b \u2206m231 in which case there is no hierarchy.\nBut one can still ask what the sign of \u2206m231 is. Inverted hierarchy and quasi-degeneracy\nare very unlike to what is found in the quark sector. Even for normal hierarchy the mass\nratio is much weaker than that in quark sector.\nWhile, oscillation experiments can determine the mass squared differences and the mixing angles, information on absolute neutrino masses can come from tritium beta decay\nor neutrino-less double beta decay. The former gives the most direct bound on absolute\nneutrino masses from kinematics and the present bound is m\u03b2 < 2.3 eV (95% C.L.) coming\nfrom the Mainz tritium beta decay experiment [3]. In the standard parametrization (1.1),\nm\u03b2 can be expressed as\nm\u03b2 = (c212 c213 m21 + s212 c213 m22 + s213 m23 )1/2 .\n\n(1.2)\n\nNeutrino-less double beta decay violates Lepton number by two units and can occur if\nneutrinos are Majorana particles [4]. The best current limit on the effective mass, which is\nthe absolute value of the ee element of the mass matrix, mee :\nmee = c213 c212 m1 + ei\u03c1 c213 s212 m2 + ei(\u03c3+2\u03b4) s213 m3\n\n(1.3)\n\nis given by measurements of 76 Ge by the Heidelberg-Moscow and IGEX collaboration [5, 6]\n|mee | \u2264 0.35 \u03b6 eV ,\n1\n\n(1.4)\n\n\f\u2206m221 [10\u22125 eV2 ]\n|\u2206m231 | [10\u22123 eV2 ]\nsin2 \u03b812\nsin2 \u03b823\nsin2 \u03b813\n\nbest fit\n7.6\n2.4\n0.32\n0.50\n0.007\n\n3\u03c3 range\n7.1 - 8.3\n2.0 - 2.8\n0.26 - 0.40\n0.34 - 0.67\n\u2264 0.05\n\nTable 1: The present best-fit values and the 3\u03c3 ranges of oscillation parameters from [2].\n\nwhere \u03b6 = O(1) denotes the uncertainty coming from the nuclear physics involved in\ncalculating the decay width of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2.\nNon-zero neutrino masses and mixing imply physics beyond the standard model. The\nmost popular mechanism for giving small neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism in which\none adds heavy right-handed singlets (Type-I) [7, 8], scalar triplets (Type-II) [9] or fermion\ntriplets (type-III) [10] to generate small neutrino masses at low scale. In the context of the\ntype-I seesaw mechanism the light neutrino mass matrix is given as M = \u2212mD MR\u22121 mT\nD,\nwhere mD is the Dirac mass matrix and MR is the Majorana mass matrix of the heavy\nright-handed neutrinos. Apart from the effective neutrino mass matrix M, the low energy\nLagrangian of the lepton sector also contains the charged-lepton mass matrix Ml . The\nlepton flavor mixing matrix is defined by the two unitary matrices which diagonalize each\nmass matrix: V \u2261 Vl\u2020 V\u03bd . If one assumes the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal then\nVl = 1.\nOne way to understand the form of neutrino masses is through texture zeros in the\nMajorana mass matrix at the low scale [11, 12]. By texture zero we mean those entries\nwhich are vanishingly small as compared to some other elements. This approach had been\nadopted in quark sector [13] and therefore it seems plausible that this may work for the\nlepton sector also. The origin of such zero entries could be traced to symmetry or dynamics\nlying behind the Yukawa sector of the standard model, for example, the U (1) symmetry\nby Froggatt and Neilsen [14] with supersymmetry, or other flavor symmetries [15] which\ninclude either discrete or continuous groups. The stability of texture zeros in M against\nrenormalization group effects have been studied in [16].\nWithin the framework of the seesaw mechanism it is often considered more natural\nto study texture zeros appearing in the Yukawa coupling matrix mD and/or the righthanded Majorana mass matrix MR [17]. In general the seesaw framework contains more\nparameters compared to what can be obtained from measurements at low energy and it is\nnot possible to fix the high energy parameters entirely from low energy data. Texture zeros\nin the matrices mD and/or MR can help in reducing the number of parameters, and thus\nstrengthen the predictive power of the model.\nAnother way to increase the predictability and reduce the number of high scale parameters of the seesaw model is to reduce the number of right-handed neutrinos. The minimal\nnumber of right-handed neutrinos with which low energy phenomenology compatible with\ncurrent data can be obtained is two [18]. With one heavy neutrino after seesaw diagonalization the mass matrix at low scale is rank 1, that is, it contains two zero eigenvalues and\nhence is not consistent with the current data.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this paper we couple the two ideas and do an extensive and systematic analysis of\nall possible texture zeros in mD and MR in the framework of the minimal seesaw model\ncontaining two heavy right-handed neutrinos. There already exists exhaustive analysis of\npossible texture zeros in mD in the literature in the context of the minimal seesaw model\n[19]. But most analyses considered a diagonal form for the Majorana mass matrix MR .\nThe possibility of a non-diagonal MR and related constraints on seesaw parameters have\nbeen discussed in few papers but this discussion is not exhaustive. In addition, it is not\napparent that any mechanism leading to zeros in mD will necessarily require a diagonal\nform of MR . It is thus worthwhile to take into account the full generality of MR and\nperform an exhaustive classification of the textures according to the total number of zeros\nof mD and MR together. By this systematic analysis, we encounter not only the textures\nwhich have been discussed in the literatures [17, 18, 19] but also new viable textures arising\nout of the general treatment for MR , which have not been discussed.\nIt is important to keep in mind that, in a texture analysis, one should not fix the basis\nof the generation space in advance While it is true that one can always move from one basis\nto another by unitary transformations acting on the fields, without changing any physical\nconsequences, (for example, from some general basis to the one in which MR is diagonal\nby redefining the right-handed neutrinos) this does not mean that one can always find\nfull possibilities of textures by examination of the texture zeros in the MR diagonal basis.\nThe unitary transformation for fields is just a change of the coordinate which describes\na physical system, whereas the different (or independent) textures correspond to different\nsystems, namely, different Lagrangians. A texture zero in some basis can appear as definite\nrelations among matrix elements in other basis. For example, some texture zeros of mD\nand MR in MR non-diagonal basis is mapped to the specific relations among mass matrix\nelements of mD in MR diagonal basis. Thus the texture zeros are \"hidden\" in MR diagonal\nbasis, in the sense that one cannot reach the texture forms of the general basis as long as\none merely impose vanishing elements in mD .\nWe classify the textures by clarifying whether each combination of textures can fit the\nexperimental results or not. This is the only principle we will take. In particular, we do\nnot stand on any aesthetic discussion and as long as a certain texture can fit the data, we\nregard it as viable even if it needs fine tuning of parameters to reproduce the observable.\nSince a priori, we do not know what kind of symmetry is lying behind some fine tuning,\nwe believe this thorough analysis might bring useful results towards deeper understanding\nfor the generation structure.\nThroughout the analysis we assume that the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal.\nBecause of the observed mass hierarchy of the charged-lepton masses, it is likely that the\ncontribution to the PMNS matrix is small from the point of view of grand unification,\nthough there are interesting possibilities of highly asymmetric forms of the charged-lepton\nmass matrix [20]. In this paper we do not consider these possibilities and simply assume\nthat the neutrino sector is responsible solely for the structure of the lepton generation\nmixing.\nThe plan of the paper goes as follows. In the next section we discuss the rudimentary\nfeatures of the seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos. The following section discusses the number of possible texture zeros in the Dirac matrix mD and the Majorana mass\nmatrix MR and then does a detailed classification of the patterns based on the number of\ntexture zeros in mD and MR together. For each pattern we discuss the compatibility with\n3\n\n\fthe current oscillation data, prediction for the 1-3 leptonic mixing angle and the effective\nmass parameter constrained by neutrino-less double beta decay. We end in Section 4 by\nsummarizing our results.\n\n2\n\nThe model with two right-handed neutrinos\n\nThe leptonic part of the Yukawa interactions in presence of three left-handed and two\nright-handed neutrinos can be written as\n\u2212 L = (Y\u03bd )ij NRj \u03c6\u0303\u2020 lLi + (Yl )ij ERj \u03c6\u2020 lLi +\n\n1\nNRi c (MR )ij NRj + h.c,\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes SU (2) higgs doublet with \u03c6\u0303 = i\u03c3 2 \u03c6\u2217 , the lepton doublet of flavor i is\ndenoted by lLi , ERi are the right-handed charged-lepton singlets and NRi denote the righthanded neutrino fields which are singlets under the standard model gauge group. The\nYukawa coupling constants Y\u03bd and Yl are complex-valued 3 \u00d7 3 matrices. After the electroweak symmetry breaking one gets the charged-lepton mass matrix Ml = vYl and the\nDirac mass matrix for the neutrino as mD = vY\u03bd where v is the vacuum expectation value\nof the neutral component of the higgs doublet \u03c6. The Majorana mass matrix MR is 2 \u00d7 2\ncomplex symmetric matrix. The mass matrix for the neutral fermions can be written as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 mD\nM\u03bd =\n.\n(2.2)\nmT\nD MR\nThe light neutrino mass matrix after the seesaw diagonalization assuming MR \u226b mD is\ngiven by\n(2.3)\nM = \u2212mD MR\u22121 mT\nD.\nSince MR can be high the mass eigenvalues are naturally suppressed. In the 3+2 model\nmD is a 3 \u00d7 2 matrix and MR is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix while the light neutrino mass matrix M\nis 3 \u00d7 3. We note that the 3+2 model can be considered as the limiting case of a 3+3\nmodel where the heaviest neutrino is extremely heavy compared to the others so that the\ncontribution of the heaviest neutrino is negligibly small. In general for the 3 \u00d7 2 case there\nwill be 9 free parameters characterizing the Yukawa matrix mD and 4 parameters for MR\ngiving a total of 13 free parameters. Thus there is already a reduction from 24 to 13 as\ncompared to the 3+3 model. As we will see later for the cases of texture zeros in mD and\nMR the number of free parameters can be reduced even further.\nIn general the Majorana mass matrix MR is non-diagonal in the basis where the charged\ncurrent is flavor diagonal. It is thus written as\nUR\u2020 MR UR\u2217 = diag(M1 , M2 ).\n\n(2.4)\n\nOne can make a basis rotation so that the right-handed Majorana mass matrix MR becomes\ndiagonal by the unitary matrix UR . However in that case the Dirac mass matrix mD also\ngets modified to mD UR\u2217 . Let us denote the modified Dirac mass matrix as\nmD UR\u2217 \u2261 (a1 , a2 ) ,\n\n4\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fwhere a1 and a2 are column vectors which have three elements. With this notation we can\nwrite the seesaw formula (2.3) as\nM = \u2212\n\n2\nX\ni=1\n\nai * aT\ni\n\n1\n.\nMi\n\n(2.6)\n\nNote that the summation is stopped at 2 because we assume only two right-handed neutrinos take part in the seesaw mechanism. This expression highlights the most prominent\nfeature of the seesaw mechanism with two heavy neutrinos. That is, the rank of the induced\nMajorana mass matrix is at most 2, which means that we have at least one massless lefthanded neutrino. Since the renormalization group running does not affect the rank of the\nmass matrix, it is a scale independent feature of the two right-handed seesaw framework.\nThe Majorana mass matrix M is symmetric and can in general be diagonalized as\nV\u03bdT MV\u03bd = D\u03bd\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere D\u03bd is the diagonal (real and positive) mass eigenvalues for the left-handed neutrinos:\nD\u03bd = diag(m1 , m2 , m3 ), and V\u03bd is an unitary matrix which includes 3 angles and 6 phases\nin general. The charged-lepton mass matrix Ml is diagonalized as\nVlT Ml Ul\u2217 = Dl ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere Vl and Ul are unitary matrices which can be removed by unitary rotations of the\nleft and the right-handed charged-leptons. The diagonal matrix Dl denotes the observed\ncharged-lepton masses: Dl = diag(me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ). The generation mixing for leptons is\ndescribed by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, which is defined by\nthe product of the two unitary matrices;\nV \u2261 Vl\u2020 V\u03bd .\n\n(2.9)\n\nA general 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix can be parameterized by three 3 angles and 6 phases. Out\nof 6 phases, 3 phases can be removed by the redefinition of the left-handed neutrino fields.\nThus 3 angles and 3 phases can affect observables if the neutrinos are Majorana particle.\nIn the case where the neutrinos are Dirac particle, we can further remove 2 phases by using\nthe right-handed neutrinos, and there is only 1 phase which is responsible for CP violation,\njust as in the quark sector.\nIn the following discussion, we assume that the charged-lepton mass matrix is diagonal,\nso that Vl = I. While this treatment will not cover whole possible solutions in the lepton\nsector, it turns out that this is indeed a good first step to extract physics involved in\nthe seesaw mass matrices with two right-handed neutrinos. Against the diagonal chargedlepton mass matrix, we will perform texture analysis step by step from the most minimal\n(maximal number of zero) level. We discuss not only successful textures, but also the\ntextures which are not totally compatible with the experimental data. These textures can\nbecome viable with the inclusion of non-diagonal charged lepton matrices and from an\nunderstanding of which sector is inconsistent with data it will be possible to determine the\nform of the non-diagonal charged-lepton textures which are needed to make the \"close to\nviable\" seesaw texture acceptable.\n5\n\n\fFinally, we would like to note that the generation indices for the lepton doublet is\nthus fixed in any discussions below. In particular, it should be noted that any exchanging\noperation for the rows of mD do affect physical consequences (however small they are) so\nthat the textures which are related to each other by such exchange should be regarded as\nindependent textures.\n\n3\n\nTexture analysis\n\nIn this section we will first consider the texture zeros of mD and MR separately and then\ncheck the total number of texture zeros together in mD and MR . Here the number of the\nzero means the number of the independent vanishing elements in each matrix. For example,\nfor a symmetric matrix, \"1 zero\" means that a diagonal element or a pair of off-diagonal\ncomponents in symmetric positions are anomalously small compared to the other elements.\n\n3.1\n\nZeros of the Dirac mass matrix mD\n\nFirst of all, let us consider the minimality of mD , without taking into account the form of\nMR . The following cases may arise:\n\u2022 More than 3 zeros\n\nIt should be useful to note that if the number of vanishing elements in mD is \u2265 4, it\ncannot lead to viable forms of the effective Majorana matrix M. This is because if\nwe have 4 or more than 4 zeros in mD , there is at least one vanishing row in the Dirac\nmass matrix. This means that at least one left-handed neutrino is decoupled from\nthe right-handed states so that the neutrinos can be mixed only between the other\ntwo states which are coupled with the right-handed neutrinos. We can thus exclude\nmore than 3 zeros in mD .\n\n\u2022 3 zeros\n\nThe next possibility is to consider three zeros in mD . We have 6 C3 = 20 patterns of\nmatrices as the general possibilities of 3 zero textures in mD . They can be classified\ninto three categories. The first one includes the matrices which have one vanishing\nrow. There are 12 patterns of such matrices but none of them can reproduce observation, as we saw in the discussion above. The second one includes the matrices\nwhich have one vanishing column. The 2 patterns of such matrices are also not viable\nbecause the vanishing column implies that only one right-handed neutrino takes part\nin the seesaw mechanism, which leads to two massless states. The third category is\nformed by the other 6 patterns. We cannot exclude these patterns as long as we are\nconcerned with only Dirac mass matrix mD . An example in this category is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 d\nmD = \uf8ed b 0 \uf8f8 .\n(3.1)\nc 0\nThe other 5 patterns are obtained by permuting the rows and columns of (3.1). In the\nfollowing discussions, we will examine these 6 patterns of mD as general possibilities\nof the 3 zero mD .\n6\n\n\f\u2022 2 zeros\n\nThe next to minimal number of zeros is 2. In this case we have 6 C2 = 15 patterns\nof matrices as the general possibilities. They can be classified into three categories.\nThe first one includes the 3 matrices which have one vanishing row. As we saw in the\ndiscussion above, we need not to examine these three. The second one includes the 6\nmatrices which have two zero entries in the same column, for example\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na 0\nmD = \uf8ed b 0 \uf8f8 .\n(3.2)\nc f\nThe other five patterns are obtained by permuting the rows and the columns of (3.2).\nThe third category is formed by the other 6 patterns, which have two zero elements\nin different columns. For example,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na 0\nmD = \uf8ed 0 e \uf8f8 .\n(3.3)\nc f\n\nThe other five patterns are obtained by permuting the rows and the columns of (3.3)\n(or the permutations of the rows only). The 12 matrices which belong to the last two\ncategories are not excluded a priori. In the following discussions, we take these 12\npatterns as general possibilities of the 2 zero mD .\n\n3.2\n\nZeros of MR\n\nSince we have a 2 \u00d7 2 MR and we include the possibility of non-diagonal MR we can have\nthe following options\n\u2022 3 zeros\n\nThis gives a MR with all entries as zero and so this is excluded.\n\n\u2022 2 zeros\n\nIn this case there are two possibilities\n(i) The diagonal entries are zero\nMR =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0\nM12\n.\nM12\n0\n\n(3.4)\n\n(ii) One diagonal entry and the off-diagonal entries are zero\n\nMR =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n0\n0\n.\n0 M22\n\nor\n7\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fMR =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nM11 0\n.\n0\n0\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe last two options give vanishing determinants and give rise to a state which does\nnot receive seesaw suppression in mass. In this paper, we do not consider such exotic\nspectrum though it is an interesting possibility to accommodate more than two mass\ndifferences. We therefore conclude that only the option (i) can be viable.\n\u2022 1 zero\n\nThe possible options for this case are\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\nM12\n.\nMR =\nM12 M22\n\n(3.7)\n\nMR =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nM11 M12\n.\nM12\n0\n\n(3.8)\n\nMR =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nM11\n0\n.\n0\nM22\n\n(3.9)\n\nAll of these matrices have non-vanishing determinant. We thus regard these three\nmatrices as general possibilities in the following analysis.\n\n3.3\n\nZeros of mD and MR combined \u2013 almost viable forms \u2013\n\nSo far we have discussed the texture zeros for the Dirac mass matrix mD and the Majorana\nmass matrix MR separately. In this section we search for the combinations of mD and\nMR which are compatible with the present oscillation data, keeping the results of Section\n3.1 and 3.2 in mind. We classify the combinations of the two matrices according to total\nnumber of texture zeros to be distributed in mD and MR . We will find that at the 4 zero\nlevel, several textures appear to be close to perfectly viable.\nLet us consider total 6 zero elements in the mass matrices mD and MR as a starting\npoint of texture analysis. The maximum number of texture zeros admissible in mD is three.\nThis leaves us with the rest of the three zeros in MR which is excluded. Thus there are no\nviable textures in the case of the total 6 zeros.\nWe next consider the possibility of having total 5 zeros in mD and MR . According to\nthe discussion in Section 3.1 and 3.2, we can only have the case where mD has 3 zeros and\nMR has 2 zeros. Then M is given as,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0013\n0 d \u0012\n1 \u0013\u0012\n0\n0 b c\nM\n12\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nM =\nb 0\n1\n0\nd 0 0\nM12\nc 0\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 bd cd\n1\n.\n(3.10)\n= \uf8edbd 0 0 \uf8f8\nM12\ncd 0 0\n8\n\n\fIt should be noted that MR is invariant under the exchange of the generation label. By\nvirtue of this feature, the resultant Majorana mass matrices of the other possible combinations are obtained by permuting the rows and the columns of (3.10). It is interesting\nto note that the texture form (3.10) can be obtained from Le \u2212 L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 flavor symmetry.\nWhile naive bi-maximal structure can be produced with inverted hierarchy, it is clear that\nthe two nonzero masses are degenerate. Thus we conclude that there is no solution in the\nlevel of the total 5 zero texture.\nThe next step is the total 4 zero textures. In this case, there are two possibilities;\n(i) 3 zeros in mD and 1 zero in MR\n(ii) 2 zeros in mD and 2 zeros in MR\nIn the following we investigate the above cases in detail one by one.\n(i) 3 zero mD and 1 zero MR\nTo study this case, it is convenient to write down an example of the seesaw formula in\nterms of a most general 2 \u00d7 2 MR as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n0 d \u0012\nA B\n0 b c\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nM =\nb 0\nB C\nd 0 0\nc 0\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\nd C bdB cdB\n= \uf8edbdB b2 A bcA \uf8f8 ,\n(3.11)\ncdB bcA c2 A\nwhere we introduce the parameters A, B, C just to simplify the notation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nM22 \u2212M12\nA B\n\u22121\n.\n\u2261 (MR ) =\n2\n\u2212M12 M11\nB C\nM11 M22 \u2212 M12\n\n(3.12)\n\nIn the following, we examine 1 zero MR by taking A, B or C to be zero in turn. As we\nsaw in Section 3.1, there are 6 patterns of 3 zero mD which we should consider. Although\n(3.11) presents just an example of the 6 possible combinations of 3 zero mD and general\nMR , we can study the consequences of the other 5 patterns by careful observation of (3.11).\nKeeping A, B, and C to be non-zero, we have 12 real parameters characterizing mD\nand MR . All the 3 phases of mD and 2 phases of MR can be removed by redefining the\nfields and so for this case we have 7 parameters \u2013 3 real parameters for mD and 4 real\nparameters for MR (one of which is a phase). With no loss of generality, we can take the\nbasis in which the matrix element C has a phase. We thus regard only M11 as complex in\nwhat follows.\nThe most striking feature of the matrix (3.11)\u221ais that it has\nwhich is\n\u221a an eigenvector\nT\n2\n2\n2\n2\nassociated with the zero eigenvalue; that is, (0, \u2212c/ b + c , b/ b + c ) . Note that this\nvector does not depend on the phase of M11 . Since the zero element in this eigenvector\nmust be interpreted as the reactor angle, the mass ordering of the neutrinos is fixed to be\nthe inverted hierarchy. Since this matrix yields a vanishing \u03b813 it is characterized by a class\n9\n\n\fof the discrete Z2 symmetry [21]. The atmospheric angle is controlled by the elements b\nand c. By taking b \u2243(=)c, we have \u03b823 \u2243(=)45\u25e6 . This corresponds to \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 exchange\nsymmetry.\nWe have three options to take 1 zero texture in MR , that is, A = 0 , B = 0 or C = 0.\nIn these options, we find that C = 0 is the most promising texture and the other two cases\nare disfavored at the first glance:\n\u2022 B = 0: This case corresponds to a 3 zero mD with a diagonal MR . In this case, there\nis only one mixing \u2013 in the 2-3 sector and thus cannot reproduce two large mixing\nangles.\n\u2022 A = 0: There are three zeros in the Majorana mass matrix M which is not viable\nwith current data [11]. We note that in this case the 1-2 mixing angle will be given\nas\n1\n1\n\u221a + \u221a \u03b1,\n2\n8 2\n\nsin \u03b812 \u2243\n\n(3.13)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the small parameter \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 |. Thus the 1-2 angle is greater\nthan the maximal value of \u03c0/4 which is ruled out by solar neutrino data [22].\nNote that the logic which we have used to exclude A = 0 and B = 0 are also applicable to\nthe case of the other 5 patterns of mD because the Majorana mass matrix M for the other\n5 textures can be obtained by permuting rows and columns of (3.11).\nBy setting C = 0, we lose the sole matrix element which is responsible for the CP\nviolation. This means that there is no CP violating phase in the\nLagrangian.\n\u221a\n\u221a lepton Yukawa\nAs we have seen the above, there is an eigenvector (0, \u2212c/ b2 + c2 , b/ b2 + c2 )T . This\nfact forces the mass spectrum to be the inverted hierarchy. Moreover, we can see that it\nneeds b \u2243 c to produce the observation of the atmospheric neutrinos. The inverted mass\nspectrum is then realized in the region where M12 \u2243 M13 \u226b M22 \u2243 M23 \u2243 M33 is\nsatisfied. The magnitudes of the two nonzero mass eigenvalues m1 and m2 are controlled\nby the magnitude of M12 \u2243 M13 and the mass difference between these two states are\nruled by M22 \u2243 M23 \u2243 M33 . This means that the 1-2 rotation angle is controlled by\nthe ratio dB/bA in such a way that tan 2\u03b812 \u2243 2dB/bA \u226b 1. Thus the solar angle will be\npredicted as \u2243 45\u25e6 . In fact, we can write down the solar angle sin \u03b812 in terms of the mass\ndifferences as\nsin \u03b812 \u2243\n\n1\n1\n\u221a \u2212 \u221a \u03b1.\n2 8 2\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe prediction (3.14) is due to the absence of the 1-1 matrix element in the low energy\nMajorana mass matrix. Although the solar angle is predicted to be smaller than 45\u25e6 , the\ndeviation from maximal is too small to be compatible with the data.\nAs for the other possible combinations, we can see the consequences immediately from\nthe above one example. As we saw in Section 3.1, there are 6 patterns of 3 zero mD which\nwe should consider, and they are related each other by permutations of the rows and the\ncolumns. The one of them is just the texture which we took in (3.11). Thus the other 5\nresultant Majorana mass matrices are obtained by exchanging the rows and the columns\nof (3.11), and replacing the matrix element A with C. In the case of the 2 patterns of mD\n10\n\n\fwhich are obtained by permuting rows of mD in (3.11), it should be noted that we cannot\nreplace the first row with the other one, otherwise the zero element in the mixing matrix\ncomes in the wrong position. This means that these 2 patterns can be safely excluded.\nAs for the 3 patterns which are associated with exchanging the columns of mD in (3.11),\nwe can discuss in the same manner as the above by replacing A with C. We find that the\nDirac mass matrix obtained by a column exchange\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nd 0\n(3.15)\nmD = \uf8ed 0 b \uf8f8\n0 c\nis the most promising one. The Majorana mass matrix M for this case can be related to\nthe general case considered in (3.11) by exchange of label of the right-handed neutrinos\nA \u2194 C i.e.\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC B\n\u22121\nMR =\n(3.16)\nB A\nIt is clear from (3.11) that after the exchange A \u2194 C the promising texture in this case is\nobtained by putting A=0. In summary, in the case of 3 zero mD and 1 zero MR , we found\nthat the most promising texture, which can give one zero and two large mixing angles, is the\nC = 0 case in (3.11) and A = 0 with (3.15). However, these two combinations are related\neach other by the label exchange of the two heavy neutrinos so that these two solutions\ndescribe exactly the same physics. Over all, we conclude C = 0 case in (3.11) (or A = 0\nwith (3.15)) is the most promising texture. The predictions are very distinctive;\n\u2022 The inverted hierarchy with m3 = 0.\n\u2022 \u03b813 = 0.\n\u271f at all (at high energy as well as low energy).\n\u2022 No \u271f\nCP\n\n\u2022 sin \u03b812 \u2243\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u03b1.\n8 2\n\nThe atmospheric angle \u03b823 is well controlled, and we can reproduce the best fit value\n\u03b823 = 45\u25e6 . Thus this texture, which can be obtained since we have gone beyond the\nassumption of a diagonal MR , needs some correction to the 1-2 mixing angle. Such a\ncorrection can be traced to various sources. For example, it is clear that 1-2 mixing from\ncharged-lepton sector can ameliorate the problem immediately. As another example, it\nmight be possible to cure the problem by the renormalization group effect from some\n(high) energy scale (at which the texture zeros are imposed) to the electroweak scale [23].\n(i) 2 zero mD and 2 zero MR\nNext let us explore the case of 2 zero mD and 2 zero MR . As we have discussed in Section\n3.2, for two zero MR the only allowed possibility with non-vanishing determinant is the\none with zeros at the diagonal positions. Note that in a basis where MR is diagonal, the\nelements of mD in this basis are made out of the linear combinations of the elements in the\n11\n\n\foriginal basis. Therefore texture zeros for mD in the new basis imply particular relations\nbetween matrix elements of mD in the old basis, so that the texture analysis considering\nzeros of mD and a diagonal MR would not include this 2 zero mD and 2 zero MR case.\nAs we saw in Section 3.1, we should consider two types of 2 zero mD . Namely, the 6\npatterns represented by (3.2) with the two zero entries in the same column and the other\n6 patterns represented by (3.3) with the zero entries in different columns. A representative\nfor the 6 combinations which involve the former type of mD is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na d\n0\nB\n\u22121\nmD = \uf8ed b 0\uf8f8 , MR =\n,\n(3.17)\nB 0\nc 0\nHowever these mass matrices induce the same form of the left-handed Majorana mass\nmatrix as that of (3.11) with A = 0. We thus drop this combination from the list of\npromising texture. Furthermore, we can also drop the other 5 combinations because their\neffective Majorana mass matrices can be obtained by permuting rows and columns of that\nof (3.17). We thus conclude that there is no viable texture in this category.\nFor the group represented by (3.3), we have an example\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na 0\n0 B\n\u22121\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nmD = 0 e , MR =\n.\n(3.18)\nB 0\nc f\nAfter the seesaw integration, we have\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 ae af\nM = \uf8ed ae 0 ce \uf8f8B.\naf ce 2cf\n\n(3.19)\n\nThere remains two texture zeros at the low energy scale. We note that by the redefinition of\nthe fields, all the phase degrees of freedom can be moved away from the Yukawa Lagrangian\nof the lepton sector. Thus there is no CP violating phenomena with the texture (3.18) at\nhigh energy as well as low energy.\nThe texture combination (3.18) can accommodate both the normal and the inverted\nhierarchy. We study them individually.\nNormal hierarchy In the case\nthe neutrino masses m1 , m2 and\np\np of the normal hierarchy,\nm3 are fixed as m1 = 0, m2 = \u2206m221 and m3 = \u2206m231 . Since we have only 3 effective\nparameters after the seesaw operation, we have two weak eigen-basis invariant predictions;\ntan \u03b813\nsin \u03b812\n\n1\n\n= \u03b14,\n\n1\n1 1\nsin \u03b823 \u2243 \u03b1 4 \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 4 sin2 \u03b813 ,\n2\n\n(3.20)\n(3.21)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /\u2206m231 . Substituting 3\u03c3 lower bound of \u03b1 and sin \u03b812 into (3.20), we find\nsin \u03b813 = 0.20.\n12\n\n(3.22)\n\n\fThus with the marginal values of \u03b1 and sin \u03b812 we already reach just below the current\nupper bound on sin \u03b813 in (3.22). Moreover, from the relation (3.21), we can see that there\nis an anti-correlation between sin \u03b813 and sin \u03b823 in the sense that for a smaller sin \u03b813 ,\nsin \u03b823 will be larger. Hence a conservative upper bound of sin \u03b823 can be obtained in the\nlimit \u03b813 \u2192 0. Then we find\n1\n\nsin \u03b823 . \u03b1 4 = 0.42,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhere we used the best fit values of the mass differences on the right-hand side. While the\nsolar and the reactor angles are within present 3\u03c3 data, we need some corrections to fit the\natmospheric angle.\nAs we saw in 3.1, the other 5 patterns of Dirac mass matrices are obtained by permuting\nrows of (3.3). It is useful to note that the form of MR does not change if we exchange its\nrows and columns. Thus, the Dirac textures which are related with column exchange induce\nthe same predictions and they cannot be independent solution each other. This fact reduces\nthe number of the mass matrices which we need to examine 5 to 2, that is, it is enough to\nconsider 2 patterns which is obtained by exchanging 1-3 and 2-3 rows of (3.3).\nFor the 1-3 exchanging texture, the PMNS matrix element |V33 | for the case of (3.3)\nis identified as the reactor angle. However, we can see from (3.21) that this element is\napproximated as\n1 1\n|V33 | \u2243 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2 .\n2\n\n(3.24)\n\nThus the proper magnitude for the reactor angle cannot realized at all. We conclude that\n1-3 exchanging texture from (3.3) is excluded because of this large discrepancy in \u03b813 .\nOn the other hand, the 2-3 exchanging texture should be regarded as the same level\nas the texture of (3.3). The conservative upper bound (3.23) implies that the lower bound\nof |V33 | \u2265 0.82 from the normalization condition of the third column vector in the PMNS\nmatrix. Since the allowed range of the atmospheric angle is almost symmetric around the\nmaximal value 45\u25e6 , the deviations from the best fit value are the same in both textures.\nInverted hierarchy\nof the inverted hierarchy, the masses m1 , m2 and m3\np In the casep\nare fixed as m1 = |\u2206m231 |, m2 = |\u2206m231 | + \u2206m221 and m3 = 0. There are two relations\namong observables;\nsin \u03b813 \u2243\n\n1\n\u03b1,\n4 tan \u03b823\n\n(3.25)\n\nsin \u03b812 \u2243\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a \u2212 \u221a \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a sin \u03b813 ,\n2\n8 2\n2 2\n\n(3.26)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 |. From (3.25), we can see that sin \u03b813 is predicted to be small;\nsin \u03b813 \u223c O(10\u22123 ) (with the best fit values of \u03b823 and the mass differences, we have sin \u03b813 =\n8.0\u00d710\u22123 ). As for the solar angle, we can see from (3.26) that it becomes near the maximal\nvalue \u03b812 \u2243 45\u25e6 . Thus we see that the texture (3.18) predicts nearly bi-maximal mixing\nwith the inverted mass ordering. The deviation from the bi-maximal form is observed to\nbe small and it is characterized by the magnitude of the reactor angle sin \u03b813 \u223c O(10\u22123 ).\nThus this case also needs correction to the 1-2 mixing angle to become a perfectly viable.\n13\n\n\fAccording to the discussion in Section 3.1, there remains 5 textures which should be\nexamined. However, due to the 1-2 permutation invariance of MC\u22121 , we need not try the\n3 textures which are related with (3.3) by exchanging the columns. Thus it is enough to\ninvestigate the two textures which are obtained by exchanging the 1-3 and 2-3 rows of (3.3),\nas in the case for the normal hierarchy. For the Dirac mass matrix mD which is obtained\nby 1-3 row exchange of (3.3), the relation (3.25) implies that the small entry of O(10\u22123 )\nis sitting in V33 . Moreover, the element |V23 | must be near maximal to fit the atmospheric\nneutrino data. Thus the 1-3 element |V13 | is also near maximal, which is by no means\nviable. On the other hand the 2-3 exchanging texture is apparently viable because the\nbi-maximal mixing does not change physics under this exchange.\n\n3.4\n\nZeros of mD and MR combined \u2013 viable mass matrices \u2013\n\nIn this section, we explore the case where the neutrino Yukawa sector has total 3 vanishing\nelements. In this level, we will find textures which are totally compatible with the data\nand have one definite correlation among neutrino masses and mixings.\nFor total 3 zero case the different possibilities are\n(A) 3 zero mD and no zero MR\n(B) 2 zero mD and one zero MR\n(C) 1 zero mD and two zero MR\nBy exhausting all texture combinations in each category above, we found 7 combinations\nof mD and MR which are consistent with the present 3\u03c3 data for the three generation\nneutrino oscillation.\nTable 2. shows 7 solutions and their predictions. Besides the 7 patterns in the table,\nthere exist other 7 solutions which can be obtained by permuting 2-3 rows of mD for each\ntexture. Although these 14 patterns are independent in the sense that they are not related\neach other by the field rotation, the predictions are almost the same for both 7 textures.\nThus we present only 7 partners in Table 2. We would like to emphasize that we are not\ndropping any possibilities. The result is obtained partly by general considerations and\npartly by direct examination of each mass matrix combination.\nIn the following, we build up the whole picture by discussing each of the seven cases\npresented in Table 2.\n3.4.1\n\nA1. 3 zero mD and 0 zero MR\n\nHere we discuss the solution A1, where the Dirac mass matrix mD has 3 zeros while the\nMajorana mass matrix MR has no-vanishing entries;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 d\nA B\n\u22121\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nmD = b 0 , MR =\n.\n(3.27)\nB C\nc 0\nFor this case we have 12 real parameters characterizing mD and MR .

The column \"NH\" and \"IH\" means\nthe normal and the inverted hierarchy respectively. In these columns, the symbol \" \"\nmeans each texture can accommodate each mass ordering, and \"\u00d7\" means it cannot. For\nthe column \"sin \u03b813 \", we show the correlations between sin \u03b813 and other observables to\nthe leading order of \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 | and sin \u03b813 . For the column |mee |, we show a\ntypical magnitudes for the averaged neutrino masses responsible for neutrino-less double\nbeta decay.\n\n15\n\n\fhave 7 parameters \u2013 3 real parameters for mD and 4 real parameters for MR (one of which\nis a phase). As we discussed below (3.11), we can redefine the lepton fields in such a way\nthat only one parameter in MR has complex phase. Following the discussion below (3.11),\nhere also we put the phase to the matrix element C.\nWe note that this case has already been discussed as a part of the general discussion\nfor 2 zero mD and 1 zero MR (cf. eq. (3.11)) and the conclusions obtained i.e. \u03b813 = 0,\ninverted hierarchy and \u03b823 = \u03c0/4 for b = c are all applicable here. After this general\ndiscussion we proceeded with detailed calculation for the C = 0 case and found that the\n4 zero texture cannot give the correct solar mixing. In this section we study the effect\nof C 6= 0. In order to study the effect of the d2 C term, let us change the coordinate by\ne;\northogonal transformation U\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n\u2212c \uf8f7\nb\ne =\uf8ec\n(3.28)\nU\n\uf8ed0 \u221ab2 +c2 \u221ab2 +c2 \uf8f8 .\nb\nc\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0\nb2 +c2\nb2 +c2\nThen we find\nf = U\ne T MU\ne\nM\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2\nb2 + c2 dB 0\n\u221a d C\n= \uf8ed b2 + c2 dB (b2 + c2 )A 0\uf8f8 .\n0\n0\n0\n\n(3.29)\n\nNote that we are choosing the basis in which only the matrix element C has a complex\nphase. Thus we can regard only M11 as complex valued without loss of generality. In\nthis basis, the effect of C 6= 0 is clear. If the element C were vanishing, there would be\ncorrelation between the mass eigenvalues and the 1-2 mixing angle in the upper-left 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix of (3.29). However in this case the existence of d2 C term relaxes the constraint and\nwe can fit any mass eigenvalues and the 1-2 mixing by tuning the parameters in (3.29).\nWhile there is one complex phase in (3.27) and (3.29), we have no chance to observe\nCP violation in the oscillation experiments as \u03b813 = 0. However leptogenesis [24] is possible\nby this phase. In the limit \u03b813 = 0 the effective mass constrained by 0\u03bd2\u03b2 decay (|d2 C|)\ncan be expressed as\nq\nq\n(3.30)\n|mee | \u2243 |\u2206m231 | 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b812 sin2 (\u03c1/2)\nwhich gives \u2248 0.02 \u2212 0.05 eV, where the two limits correspond to \u03c1 = \u03c0 and \u03c1 = 0\nrespectively. Thus 0\u03bd2\u03b2 will be observed in future if this texture is realized in nature [25].\nAnother interesting feature of (3.27) is that it provides tri-bimaximal mixing [26] under\nthe condition where b = c and d2 C = 2b2 A \u2212 bdB hold. Although the latter condition\nimplies a nontrivial correlation between Dirac and Majorana mass matrix, to build models\nwhich realize these relations might be an interesting research direction.\nWe note that this texture, which can be consistent with low energy phenomenology,\nis obtained by the choice of a non-diagonal MR . In the MR diagonal basis the following relationships will hold between the elements of mD : \u2212mD11 /mD12 = mD22 /mD21 =\nmD32 /mD31 = tan \u03b8R , where, \u03b8R is the angle that parametrizes the matrix UR in (2.4) that\n\n16\n\n\fdiagonalizes MR and can in general be expressed as\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos \u03b8R sin \u03b8R\n,\nUR =\n\u2212 sin \u03b8R cos \u03b8R\n\n(3.31)\n\nHence if one considers texture zeros in mD with a diagonal MR this texture will not get\nincluded.\n3.4.2\n\nB1. Two zero mD and 1 zero MR\n\nHere we discuss the solution B1, where the Dirac mass matrix mD has 2 zero while the\nMajorana mass matrix MR has 1 zero entry;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na d\nA\n0\n\u22121\nmD = \uf8ed b 0\uf8f8 , MR =\n.\n(3.32)\n0 C\nc 0\nAfter the seesaw integration, we find\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\na ab ac\nd 0 0\nM = \uf8edab b2 bc \uf8f8 A + \uf8ed 0 0 0\uf8f8 C.\nac bc c2\n0 0 0\n\n(3.33)\n\nNote that we can take a basis in which only the parameter a or d have complex phase with\nno loss of generality. In spite of the existence of this un-removable phase, there is no CP\nviolation at the low\u221aenergy. One\n\u221a can understand this by noting that this matrix has an\neigenvector (0, \u2212c/ b2 + c2 , b/ b2 + c2 )T . Thus the same discussion holds as in the case\nof the solution A1 and the low energy predictions are similar.\nHowever, the texture A1 and B1 are indeed independent. They are not associated with\neach other by the unitary transformation of the fields. The physical difference can arise at\nsome high energy scale where the right-handed neutrinos are active. For example, leptogenesis or renormalization group effect-induced lepton flavor violation in supersymmetry can\nhave different implications in the two scenarios.\nIt is worth mentioning that the tri-bimaximal mixing is realized if c = b and a2 A+d2 C =\n2\n2b A \u2212 abA hold. By trying to build models which realize this relation, we might gain\ninsights into underlying symmetry or dynamical mechanism for the generation structure.\n3.4.3\n\nB2. Two zero mD and one zero MR\n\nWe now consider the case where the 2 zeros in mD are in different columns and the one\nzero in the Majorana Mass matrix is in the off-diagonal position i.e. the Majorana mass\nmatrix MR is diagonal;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na 0\nA 0\n\u22121\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nmD = b e , MC =\n.\n(3.34)\n0 C\n0 f\nThis texture has been extensively discussed in literatures from various point of view [18].\nSince the Majorana mass matrix is diagonal, only the Dirac mass matrix mD is responsible\n17\n\n\ffor the generation mixing. After the seesaw integration, we find\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb \u20322\na\na\u2032 b\u2032\n0\nM = \uf8eda\u2032 b\u2032 b\u20322 + c\u20322 c\u2032 d\u2032 \uf8f8 ,\n0\nc\u2032 d\u2032\nd\u20322\n\n(3.35)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere we re-defined the parameters as a\u2032 \u2261 a A, b\u2032 \u2261 b A, c\u2032 \u2261 e C and d\u2032 \u2261 f C.\nFor the above case there are in general 12 parameters (6 angles and 6 phases). 5 phases\ncan be absorbed in the neutrino fields. Therefore one eventually has 12 parameters (6 real\nparameters and 1 phase) . Note that we can take a basis in which only the parameter b or\ne have complex phase with no loss of generality.\nOne of the most striking feature of this texture is that it can accommodate the normal\nand the inverted hierarchy simultaneously. In Table 2, this is the only solution which has\nsuch a strong flexibility. In the following we shall discuss each case in detail individually.\nNormal hierarchy In the Majorana mass matrix (3.35), the large mixture for the atmospheric data and the normal mass ordering can be naturally accommodated by taking\nc\u2032 \u2243 d\u2032 and c\u2032 d\u2032 \u226b a\u2032 b\u2032 . The solar angle can be nicely fitted by tuning a\u2032 and b\u2032 . One of the\nmost interesting features for this texture is that there is a connection between CP violation\nphenomena at high energy and low energy. Also interesting is that the prediction for \u03b813\nwhich originates in the vanishing elements in 1-3 position;\nsin \u03b813\n\n\u2243\n=\n\n\u221a\n1\nsin 2\u03b812 tan \u03b823 \u03b1\n2\n0.050 \u2212 0.14,\n\n(3.36)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /\u2206m231 . In the last line, we substitute 3\u03c3 boundary values into each\nobservables. The predicted range is very encouraging for the next generation oscillation\nexperiments with artificial sources [27].\nThe effective mass |mee | governing neutrino-less double beta decay for normal hierarchy\ncan be expressed as\ni(2\u03b4+\u03c3\u2212\u03c1)\n\n|mee | = e\n\nq\nq\n2 2\n2\n\u2206m21 c13 s12 + \u2206m231 s213 .\n\n(3.37)\n\nFrom the relation (3.36), we can see that the contribution from the first term is dominant\nin (3.37). By substituting best fit values of the solar angle and the mass differences, we\nobtain |mee | \u223c 0.003 eV for the normal hierarchy.\nInverted hierarchy\nordering by taking\n\nOn the other hand, (3.35) can also accommodate the inverted mass\n\n\u20322\n\nq\n\n|\u2206m231 |,\nq\nq\n\u2032 \u2032\n2\n2\na b \u2243 |\u2206m31 | \u2212 \u2206m21 \u2212 |\u2206m231 |,\np\n|\u2206m231 |\n.\nb\u20322 + c\u20322 = c\u2032 d\u2032 = d\u20322 \u2243\n2\n\na\n\n\u2243\n\n18\n\n(3.38)\n(3.39)\n(3.40)\n\n\fAfter diagonalizing the 2-3 block\u221aof (3.35) by maximal mixing, we find the small 1-3 (and\n3-1) element appears as \u223c a\u2032 b\u2032 / 2. Thus we can naively estimate the prediction for the\nreactor angle to be\nsin \u03b813 \u2243\n\n1 \u2206m221\n\u221a\n\u223c 0.01,\n2 2 |\u2206m231 |\n\n(3.41)\n\nwhere we use the best fit values for the mass differences in the last line. Unfortunately\nthe predicted magnitude is small compared to the possible reach of the next generation\nexperiments.\nIt is interesting to notice that the sum of the matrix elements in each p\nrow in (3.35) is\n\u20322\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u20322\n\u20322\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u20322\nnearly the same.

This\nimplies that we can have a tri-maximal eigenvector (1/ 3 , 1/ 3 , 1/ 3)T by tuning the\nparameters. Thus, the mixing matrix must be made out of the product of the tri-bimaximal\nmixing and a perturbation matrix;\nV\n\n= Vtri O\u01eb\n\uf8eb \u22122\n\u221a\n\n=\n\n6\n\uf8ec \u221a1\n\uf8ed 6\n\u221a1\n6\n\n\u221a1\n3\n\u221a1\n3\n\u221a1\n3\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\ncos \u03b8\u01eb 0 sin \u03b8\u01eb\n\u22121 \uf8f7 \uf8ed\n\u221a\n0\n1\n0 \uf8f8,\n2\uf8f8\n1\n\u221a\n\u2212 sin \u03b8\u01eb 0 sin \u03b8\u01eb\n0\n\n(3.42)\n\n2\n\nwhere the angle \u03b8\u01eb is small as we will see in what follow. From this expression, we can infer\nthat some generation symmetry exists behind the mass matrix (3.35). For example, it is\nknown that the S3 flavor symmetry and its breakdown can naturally produce the mixing\nform of (3.42) [28]. If such a symmetric structure can account for the texture (3.35), the\nparameter set which is needed to produce the inverted hierarchy is no longer a group of\ntuned-parameters but rather unavoidable consequence of flavor symmetry and its breaking\nphenomena. Furthermore, we can use the expression (3.42) for more practical purposes.\nFor example, we can obtain more precise expression for \u03b813 than the rough estimation\n(3.41) by fixing the angle \u03b8\u01eb in (3.42). By reconstructing\np matrix in terms of the\np the mass\nV in (3.42) and the diagonal mass eigenvalues diag( |\u2206m231 | , |\u2206m231 | + \u2206m221 , 0), and\nimposing the texture zero condition for the 1-3 entry, we find\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm2\ncos \u03b8\u01eb sin \u03b8\u01eb\n2\n\u221a \u2212 \u221a\n\u2212\ncos \u03b8\u01eb\nm1 = 0,\n(3.43)\n3\n3\n6\n2\np\np\nwhere m1 = |\u2206m231 | and m2 = |\u2206m231 | + \u2206m221 . From this equation we can fix the\nperturbation \u03b8\u01eb as\nsin \u03b8\u01eb\n\n\u2243\n\n\u03b1\n\u221a ,\n2 3\n\n(3.44)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 |. Here we choose the smaller solution of the equation (3.43) for\n\u03b1\nwhich agrees well with (3.41).\nfitting the \u03b813 . From (3.44) we find that sin \u03b813 = 3\u221a\n2\nThe above prediction is interesting in the sense that it is associated with the tribimaximal mixing and its deviation. However we can expand (3.44) to more general\nformula. As we have done in the case of the normal hierarchy, we can write the Majorana mass matrix in terms of the mixing angles and the mass eigenvalues, and derive the\n19\n\n\fcondition for the 1-3 and 3-1 vanishing elements. Then we find\n\u2212 m1 c212 s13 cos \u03b4 + m1 c12 s12 t23 \u2212 m2 s212 s13 cos(\u03b4 + \u03c1) \u2212 m2 c12 s12 t23 cos \u03c1 = 0,\n\n(3.45)\n\n\u2212 m1 c212 s13 sin \u03b4 \u2212 m2 s212 s13 sin(\u03b4 + \u03c1) \u2212 m2 c12 s12 t23 sin \u03c1 = 0.\n\n(3.46)\n\nand\n\nwhere t23 \u2261 tan \u03b823 , \u03b4 is the Dirac phase and \u03c1 stands for the Majorana phase. From (3.46),\nwe can see that \u03b4 = \u03c1 = O(s13 ) must hold in order to keep the texture zero in 1-3 position.\nThen (3.45) gives\nsin \u03b813 =\n\n\u03b1\nsin 2\u03b812 tan \u03b823\n4\n\n(3.47)\n\nas\u221a a leading order relation in \u03b1 and sin \u03b813 . Note that at the tri-bimaximal limit sin 2\u03b812 \u2192\n2 2\n\u03b1\n\u221a\n3 and tan \u03b823 \u2192 1, we can reproduce the previous formula of sin \u03b813 = 3 2 . For inverted\nhierarchy, the effective mass mee measured in neutrino-less double beta decay can be expressed as in (3.30), which gives relatively large mass parameter |mee | \u223c 0.05 eV because\nof the small Majorana phase of \u03c1 = O(s13 ).\nThe CP violating phases and their connection to baryon number asymmetry of the\nuniverse for this texture was considered in literature in [18].\n3.4.4\n\nB3.

Thus the same discussion, as in the case of the solution\nA1 and B1, remain valid leading to similar low energy predictions.\nAs the solutions A1 and B1, this texture can also provide the tri-bimaximal mixing. It\nis realized if c = b and a2 A + 2adB = 2b2 A \u2212 (abA + bdB) hold.\nNote that in this case the MR diagonal basis implies the following relation between the\nelements mD22 /mD21 = mD32 /mD31 = tan \u03b8R where \u03b8R is the angle parametrizing UR as\nin (3.31). Thus in the MR diagonal basis the zeros of mD will not be visible.\n\n20\n\n\f3.4.5\n\nB4. Two zero mD and one zero MR\n\nHere we discuss the texture B4, where the Majorana mass matrix has texture zero in 1-1\nposition;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na 0\n0\nB\n\u22121\n.\n(3.50)\nmD = \uf8ed0 e \uf8f8 , MC =\nB C\nc f\nFor this case there are 8+4 = 12 real parameters characterizing mD and MR . The 2 phases\nin MR can be absorbed by redefining the fields and one can consider MR to be real. 3\nphases in mD can likewise be removed leaving 5 parameters one of which is a phase. Note\nthat we can take a basis in which only the parameter c or f have complex phase with no\nloss of generality. After the seesaw integration, we find the induced Majorana mass matrix\nto be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 a\u2032 e\u2032 a\u2032 f \u2032\n0 0\n0\nM = \uf8ed a\u2032 e\u2032\n0\nc\u2032 e\u2032 \uf8f8 + \uf8ed0 e\u20322 e\u2032 f \u2032 \uf8f8 ,\n(3.51)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u20322\na f c e 2c f\n0 ef f\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere the\nright-handed parameters are absorbed as e\u2032 \u2261 e C, f \u2032 \u2261 f C, a\u2032 \u2261 aB/ C,\n\u221a\nc\u2032 \u2261 cB/ C.\nFrom (3.51), we can see that 4 effective parameters a\u2032 , c\u2032 , e\u2032 , f \u2032 control the low-energy\nphysics. Thus there should be one relation among the 5 observables. As a consequence of\nthe fact that the 1-1 element is vanishing and m1 = 0, we have the prediction\n1\n\nsin \u03b813 \u2243 \u03b1 4 sin \u03b812 ,\n\n(3.52)\n\nwhich is the same as the prediction of the 4 zero textures (3.18). For the texture (3.18),\nwe have found that sin \u03b823 is predicted to be too small compared to the observed large\nmixture. However, in the texture (3.51), we have a correction matrix in 2-3 sector against\nthe first term which is the same form as (3.18). We already have one relation of (3.52) so\nthat sin \u03b823 can be fitted by tuning the original mass matrix parameters. The |mee | is \u223c\n0 in this case which is beyond the reach of the next generation neutrino-less double beta\nexperiments.\nAs we have discussed in the texture (3.18), the correlation (3.52) requires marginal\nvalues of the mass differences and the solar angle in order that the reactor angle is inside\nthe present 3\u03c3 allowed range. Together with the improvement of the data about \u03b813 , precise\nmeasurements for the mass differences and the solar angle can judge this texture in near\nfuture.\nIn this case the MR diagonal basis would imply the following relation between the\nelements \u2212mD21 /mD22 = mD12 /mD11 = tan \u03b8R where \u03b8R is the angle parametrizing UR as\nin (3.31).\n\n21\n\n\f3.4.6\n\nC1. One zero mD and two zero MR\n\nHere we discuss the texture C1, where the Dirac mass matrix has 1 zero and the Majorana\nmass matrix has 2 zeros;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na 0\n0\nB\n\u22121\nmD = \uf8ed b e \uf8f8 , MC =\n.\n(3.53)\nB 0\nc f\nIn this case there are 6 parameters (1 of which is phase) characterizing mD and 1 parameter\nfor MR . We can take a basis in which only b, e, c or f has complex phase with no loss of\ngenerality. After the seesaw integration, we find\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 a\u2032 e\u2032 a\u2032 f \u2032\n0\n0\n0\nM = \uf8ed a\u2032 e\u2032\n0\nc\u2032 e\u2032 \uf8f8 + \uf8ed0 2e\u2032 b\u2032 b\u2032 f \u2032 \uf8f8 ,\n(3.54)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\na f c e 2c\u2032 f \u2032\n0 b\u2032 f \u2032\n0\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere\u221athe right-handed parameters are absorbed as a\u2032 \u2261 a B, b\u2032 \u2261 b B, c\u2032 = c B,\ne\u2032 \u2261 e B\nIt is immediately seen that the texture zero in the 1-1 position leads to the same\nprediction as that of B4 for the normal hierarchy (3.52). Moreover, as in the texture B4,\nwe have a correction matrix in 2-3 sector against the Majorana mass matrix which is the\nresultant form of (3.18) after seesaw operation, though the structure of the correction is\ndifferent from that of B4. It turns out however that the second term (3.54) can also help\nto fit sin \u03b823 , so that there is no difference between the low energy predictions of B4 and\nC1.\nIn this case the MR diagonal basis would imply the following relation between the\nelements of mD : mD12 /mD11 = tan \u03b8R where \u03b8R is the angle parametrizing UR as in\n(3.31).\n3.4.7\n\nC2: One zero mD and two zero MR\n\nHere we discuss the texture C2, which is the last option in Table 2;\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\na d\n0 B\nmD = \uf8ed b 0 \uf8f8 , MC\u22121 =\n.\nB 0\nc f\n\n(3.55)\n\nThis texture is obtained by exchanging 1-2 rows of mD in (3.53), so that we can obtain the\nlow-energy Majorana mass matrix by permuting the 1-2 rows and the columns of (3.54)\nwith replacements b \u2192 a, a \u2192 b and e \u2192 d. As in the solution C1, we can take the basis\nin which the matrix element a, d, c or f has complex phase.\nIt turns out that this texture is viable only with the inverted hierarchy. Since the\neffective Majorana mass matrix is obtained by 1-2 exchange of the rows and the columns\nof (3.54), there is one texture zero in 2-2 position. We thus have one correlation among\nmasses and mixings. We find the sum rule\n1\n1\n1\nsin \u03b812 \u2243 \u221a \u2212 \u221a \u03b1 \u2212 \u221a tan \u03b823 sin \u03b813\n2\n8 2\n2\n22\n\n(3.56)\n\n\fholds. Here \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206m221 /|\u2206m231 | and this relation is given as the leading order approximation\nin powers of \u03b1 and sin \u03b813 . The phase parameters are to be fixed as \u03c1 = \u03c0 and \u03b4 = 0 up to\nthis order. Note that we can see this equation as a modified formula for (3.14) which leads\nto too large solar mixing. Now the problem is ameliorated by the existence of the third\nterm. If \u03b813 = 0 then this texture cannot give the correct solar angle.\nBy setting \u03b1 \u2192 0 and tan \u03b823 \u2192 1, we find (3.56) implies\n\u221a\nsin \u03b813 \u2243 1 \u2212 2 sin \u03b812 = 0.20+0.08\n(3.57)\n\u22120.1 .\nIn the right hand side we used the best fit and 3\u03c3 boundary values for the sin \u03b812 . The reactor angle must be just below the present 3\u03c3 upper bound. The future reactor experiment\nwill confirm sin \u03b813 of O(10\u22121 ) if this texture is realized.\nMoreover, it is interesting to note that 1-1 element of M is relatively large because of\nthe inverted mass spectrum:\nq\n(3.58)\n|mee | \u2243 |\u2206m231 | cos 2\u03b812 \u223c 0.02 eV.\nThus, with this texture form, we have a good chance to confirm that the neutrinos are\nindeed Majorana particles in near future [25]. The most prominent feature is that in both\nmeasurements \u2013 the reactor angle and neutrino-less double beta decay \u2013 we will find positive\nsignals simultaneously at the next generation facilities.\nFinally we would like to comment on the CP violation. As we mentioned above, there\nis one phase which cannot be removed by the redefinition of the fields. This one phase\ncontrols all CP violation phenomena at high energy as well as low energy. It is interesting\nto observe that the heavy neutrino masses are degenerate in (3.55). Although the lepton\nasymmetry vanish with exact degeneracy, the degeneracy may be relaxed, for example,\nby radiative corrections from the other sector. This fact may lead to enhanced lepton\nasymmetry by the contribution from the self-energy diagram [29]. The baryon number of\nthe universe will be proportional to Im(m\u2020D mD )212 = \u22122adX sin \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the phase (of\na or d) and X = |a|2 +|b|2 +|c|2 \u2212|d|2 \u2212|f |2 . On the other hand the weak basis invariant [30]\nresponsible for low energy CP violation is found to be proportional to (F cos \u03c6 + G) sin \u03c6\nwhere F and G are some functions of the elements of mD . The detailed analysis of CP\nviolation and the models which produce the texture (3.55) will be presented in a separate\npaper [31].\nIn this case the MR diagonal basis would imply the following relation between the\nelements of mD : mD22 /mD21 = tan \u03b8R where \u03b8R is the angle parametrizing UR as in\n(3.31).\n\n4\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this paper we analyze the texture zeros in the neutrino Yukawa Coupling matrix mD and\nthe heavy Majorana neutrino mass matrix MR in the context of the minimal seesaw model\nincluding 2 heavy right-handed neutrinos. We illustrate which textures are compatible with\nthe present neutrino oscillation data and discuss their implications for the future neutrino\nexperiments. We do not make the assumption that MR is diagonal.\nWe first consider the zeros in the neutrino Dirac mass matrix mD and show that it\ncannot have 4 or more zeros. Thus the maximum number of zeros mD can have is 3. For\n23\n\n\fthe Majorana mass matrix of the right-handed neutrinos MR , the maximum number of\nzeros can be 2. Except for the case where MR has vanishing determinant, the possible\ntexture in this case is zeros in the diagonal position. Thus the maximal number of zeros\nthat can be allowed in mD and MR taken together are 5 (3 zeros in mD and 2 zeros in\nMR ). But such a pattern give rise to a Majorana mass matrix with more than two zeros\nwhich is incompatible with data according to [11].\nIf we consider total 4 zeros in mD and MR then there are two possibilities :\n(i) 3 zeros in mD and 1 zero in MR\n(ii) 2 zeros in mD and 2 zeros in MR\nThe pattern (i) gives rise to the inverted mass ordering with m3 = 0, \u03b813 = 0 but the other\nangles are close to bimaximal mixing. The pattern (ii) can accommodate both normal\nand inverted hierarchy but it fails to predict one mixing angle. For the normal hierarchy,\nthe atmospheric angle \u03b823 is too large or too small. For the inverted hierarchy, it gives\nbi-maximal mixing which is not consistent with the current data which dictates \u03b812 to be\nclose to 33o . Thus at this level also there are no acceptable solutions.\nAt the next tier we consider total 3 zeros in mD and MR . The possibilities in these\ncases are\n(i) 3 zeros in mD and no zero in MR\n(ii) 2 zeros in mD and 1 zero in MR\n(iii) 1 zero in mD and 2 zeros in MR\nBy exhausting all texture possibilities in each category, we found seven patterns which\nare viable with the current data. This is summarized in Table 2. All these patterns\ncan accommodate either normal hierarchy or inverted hierarchy or both and gives definite\npredictions for \u03b813 which can be testable in the near future.\nFor case (i) with 3 zeros in mD and no zeros in MR it is possible to get inverted hierarchy\nwith \u03b813 = 0. It is also possible to get tri-bimaximal mixing under certain conditions on\nthe elements of mD and MR .\nFor case (ii) there are two classes of patterns \u2013 one in which both zeros in mD appear\nin the same column and the other in which the two zeros are placed in different columns.\nIn both cases assuming a diagonal MR it is possible to reproduce the current low energy\ndata. The pattern with zeros in same column of mD can accommodate only inverted hierarchy and predicts \u03b813 = 0. Again tri-bimaximal mixing is reproduced if certain equalities\ninvolving the elements of mD and MR are obeyed. The case where the zeros appear in different columns can accommodate both normal and inverted hierarchy. There are definite\npredictions for \u03b813 for both normal and inverted case which can be tested in near future\nexperiments. In this category, we also include the possibility where one of the diagonal\nentries of MR is zero. In this situation, for the case where the two zeros of mD appear in\nthe same column, one gets inverted hierarchy with sin \u03b813 = 0. Whereas for mD with the\n2 zeros in different columns one gets normal hierarchy with a definite non-zero prediction\nfor \u03b813 in terms of \u2206m221 /\u2206m231 and \u03b812 .\nFor case (iii) of 1 zero mD and 2 zero MR we find two allowed patterns viable with\ndata. Both these cases are for non-diagonal MR with definite non-zero predictions for \u03b813 .\nSummarizing, out of the 7 allowed patterns, 5 arise because we have relaxed the assumption of a diagonal MR . In a basis where MR is diagonal the zeros in mD for all these\n5 patterns get hidden as specific relations between the different elements of mD . To the\nbest of our knowledge, these textures which are viable with the current data, have escaped\n24\n\n\fattention since most analysis of texture zeros in literature had been done in a basis in\nwhich MR is diagonal, or avoided mentioning the mass textures which do not have definite\ncorrelations among observable parameters.\nThe mass matrix list of Table 2 presents the most economical extensions of the standard\nmodel. The 7 solutions are minimal solutions for neutrino physics known at present in terms\nof not only the number of the parameters but also the field content. It is rather surprising\nthat such simple economy solely leads to the rich predictions shown in Table 2. Although\nthe mass textures themselves can be discriminated only by precise measurements of the\nlow energy parameters, the mechanism which realizes particular texture might provide\nfurther predictions and/or new phenomena which can be targets of next generation neutrino\nphysics, collider physics, astrophysics and so on. We hope that the 7 possibilities and\npreceded almost viable forms provide a foundation of model building which yields testable\npredictions and deeper understanding of the generation structure.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge support from the neutrino project under the XI plan of the\nHarish-Chandra Research Institute.
