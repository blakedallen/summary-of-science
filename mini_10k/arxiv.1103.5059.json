These surface states have inspired numerous attractive proposals\nfor spintronics applications2 because they are strongly\nspin-orbit coupled and because they exhibit essential robusteness against non-magnetic perturbations. In addition, they have a linear energy-momentum dispersion at\nlow energies, they may display a half-quantized quantum\nHall effect when time-reversal symmetry is broken, and\nthey may host exotic particles such as Majorana fermions\nwhen placed in proximity to a superconductor.\nThus far both experimental and theoretical studies of\ntopological surface states have either ignored electronelectron interactions or treated them ad hoc through\nmean field3 theories. This omission is partly justified\nby the fact that weak, short-range interactions between\nmassless Dirac fermions are irrelevant in the renormalization group (RG) sense. Experimental support for the\nRG argument originates from the sizeable Fermi velocities (vF \u2243 5 \u00d7 105m/s) and the large static dielectric constants (\u01eb \u223c 50\u2212100) found in several well-established TIs,\nwhich considerably reduce the value of the bare Coulomb\ncoupling g \u2261 (e2 /\u01eb)/(2~vF ) (g . 0.05). However, there\nappears to be no fundamental principle that forbids the\nexistence of TIs with smaller4 dielectric constants and\nthereby more strongly interacting surface states. This\nexpectation is made more plausible by the ongoing and\nrapid expansion of experimentally confirmed TIs, which\ncurrently encompass a variety of bismuth compounds1 as\nwell as chalcogenides5. For instance TlBiSe2 , recently5\nidentified as a TI, has been previously reported6 to display a relatively small static dielectric constant of \u01eb \u2243 25\nin thin films. Likewise HgTe, which has been recently7\ncoaxed into a strong topological insulating state, has\n\n\u01eb \u2243 20 in bulk. Moreover, the irrelevance under RG\nof electron-electron interactions is questionable when the\nchemical potential of the topological surface states is located inside a magnetically generated energy gap (which\nintroduces an infrared cutoff in the RG flow equations).\nThis paper aims to initiate a systematic study of the\ninterplay between spin-orbit interactions, broken time reversal symmetry, and Coulomb interactions on surfaces\nof strong TIs. In particular, we focus on low-temperature\noptical properties of topological surface states whose\nchemical potential lies inside a magnetically generated\nenergy gap. The underlying microscopic mechanism for\nthis energy gap at the surface is an exchange field in\nthe direction perpendicular to the surface, which can be\nproduced by magnetic doping8 or else by deposition of\na ferromagnetic insulator with perpendicular anisotropy\n(the latter is yet to be realized experimentally). Of\ncourse, a magnetic gap may also be opened by the application of a perpendicular magnetic field; however, in\nthis case the surface states are modified qualitatively owing to the formation of Landau levels. Herein we disregard orbital effects9 and thus limit ourselves to exchangeinduced magnetic gaps.\nThe simplest interacting problem one can conceive in\nthis playground is that of a surface electron-hole excitation across the magnetic bandgap. Some of the peculiarities of this two-body problem are made apparent in Section II. On one hand, the relative motion of the electronhole pair is inextricably linked to its center-of-mass motion, which is conducive to phenomena like the spin-Hall\neffect of excitons. On the other hand, optically generated\nelectron-hole pairs have a nonzero center-of-mass group\nvelocity provided that the exchange field is particle-hole\nasymmetric. While the former property is also present\nin certain ordinary semiconductors,10 the latter trait is\nexclusive of topological surface states.\nIn Section III we consider a two dimensional surface\nwith translational and rotational symmetry. In this case,\nbroken time reversal symmetry and spin-orbit coupling\n\n\f2\nconspire to produce Coulomb interaction matrix elements\nthat favor a nonzero total angular momentum for the\nelectron-hole pairs. This skeweness of the Coulomb interaction is transferred to the binding energy of dilute\nexcitons, which becomes largest for the p-wave angular\nmomentum channel. When the surface is irradiated with\nlinearly polarized light, this p-wave exciton is optically\nbright and appears prominently in the absorption spectrum of systems with g > 0.05. In contrast, for circularly\npolarized light the dominant p-wave exciton is optically\ndark or bright depending on the handedness of the light\nas well as on the orientation of the exchange field.\nIn Section IV we turn to low dimensional TIs. Typically nanowires show more pronounced excitonic and\nelectric-field effects in their optical absorption spectrum.\nWe verify that, in presence of particle-hole asymmetry,\noptically generated excitons have a nonzero center-ofmass group velocity. Incidentally, we establish the appearance of electric-field-induced Franz-Keldysh oscillations. Nanostructures made of TIs are being routinely\nfabricated,11 which may motivate optical measurements\nthat test the effects discussed herein.\nOur quantitative results contain unknown parameters\nsuch as the surface dielectric constant and the lifetime\nof the excitons; it may be possible to extract these\nfrom photoluminescence experiments that are presently\nunderway12 in TIs.\nII.\n\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIn this section we consider an interacting electron-hole\npair located at the surface of a magnetized STI, and discuss some of its generic aspects. The Hamiltonian describing this problem is\nH = vF \u03c3e * (\u1e91 \u00d7 pe ) + \u2206e \u03a9\u0302 * \u03c3e\n\u2212 vF \u03c3h * (\u1e91 \u00d7 ph ) + \u2206h \u03a9\u0302 * \u03c3h \u2212\n\ne2\n\u2212 eE * r, (1)\n\u01ebr\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity, \u1e91 is the unit vector normal to the surface, pe(h) = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202re(h) is the momentum\nof the electron (hole), re(h) is the position of the electron\n(hole), r = re \u2212 rh is the relative coordinate, \u03c3e = \u03c3 \u2297 1\nis the spin operator acting on the electron (\u03c3 is a vector of Pauli matrices and 1 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix),\nand \u03c3h = 1 \u2297 \u03c3 is the spin operator acting on the hole.\n\u2206e(h) = \u2206e(h) \u03a9\u0302 is the exchange field sensed by the electron (hole), which can be generated either by magnetically ordered impurities doped in the STI bulk, sprinkled\non the surface8 or else by deposition of a ferromagnetic\ninsulator overlay. \u03a9\u0302 denotes the direction of the magnetization and is assumed to be spatially uniform. The\nexchange field originates from virtual transitions of the\nsurface fermions onto localized magnetic ions and need\nnot be the same for electrons and holes (i.e. \u2206e 6= \u2206h ).\nThe reasons for this asymmetry are twofold. On one\nhand, the exchange (or Kondo) coupling between itinerant fermions and localized magnetic moments is gener-\n\nally energy-dependent,13 i.e. \u2206 = \u2206(\u01eb) where \u01eb = ~vF k.\nOn the other hand, the magnetic impurities are generally not particle-hole symmetric, i.e. adding an electron\nto the local moment costs different energy from subtracting one. It follows that lim\u01eb\u21920 \u2202\u2206/\u2202\u01eb 6= 0. In Eq. (1)\nwe adopted \u2206(\u01eb) = \u2206e \u0398(\u01eb) + \u2206h \u0398(\u2212\u01eb) (where \u0398(x) is\nthe step function), which constitutes the simplest realization of broken particle-hole symmetry in the exchange\ncoupling. While often ignored for single-particle physical\nobservables, \u2206e 6= \u2206h may lead to potentially observable two-body effects as indicated below. Throughout\nthis work we assume \u03a9z 6= 0, which creates an energy\ngap of (\u2206e + \u2206h )\u03a9z for non-interacting particle-hole excitations. In addition, we assume that the Fermi energy\nof the surface states is located within this energy gap.\nThe attractive Coulomb interaction between the electron\nand the hole is screened by the static dielectric constant\n\u01eb, whose value is expected to be a weighted average of\nthe dielectric constants corresponding to the bulk TI and\nthe vacuum (or the ferromagnetic insulator). The larger\nweight is ascribed to the medium into which the surface\nstates decay more slowly. E is the in-plane electric field\nacting on the surface states.\nAdopting center-of-mass (COM) and relative coordinates, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\u2212\nH = vF (\u03c3e \u2212 \u03c3h ) * \u1e91 \u00d7 P +\n\u03a9\u0302\n(2)\nvF\n\u0013\n\u0012\nvF\ne2\n\u2206+\n+\n\u03a9\u0302 \u2212\n(\u03c3e + \u03c3h ) * \u1e91 \u00d7 p +\n\u2212 eE * r,\n2\nvF\n\u01ebr\nwhere p = pe \u2212 ph is the relative momentum, P = (pe +\nph )/2 is the COM momentum and \u2206\u00b1 = (\u2206e \u00b1 \u2206h )/2.\n\u03c3e + \u03c3h is the total spin operator for the electron-hole\npair, and it couples to the relative momentum. This can\nbe easily understood by recalling that, for a single Dirac\nfermion, the spin of an electron in the \"conduction\" band\nwith momentum k is perfectly antialigned with the spin\nof an electron with the same momentum in the \"valence\"\nband. The in-plane component of the exchange field can\nbe absorbed by a shift in the relative momentum of the\nelectron-hole pair, and therefore it is inconsequential.\nBecause both electric fields and Coulomb interactions\ncouple only to the relative coordinate, the COM momentum P is a good quantum number. Within the envelope function approximation, the conservation of P enables a factorization of the electron-hole wavefunction via\n\u03a8(R, r) = exp(iP * R)\u03c7(P, r), where R is the COM coordinate and \u03c7 is the \"relative\" wave function. The codependence of \u03c7 on P and r hints at the non-separability\nbetween the center-of-mass motion and the relative motion. In effect, the COM and relative parts in Eq. (2)\n(i.e. the first and second lines) do not commute with\none another. This observation applies to graphene and\ncarbon nanotubes as well;14 however, unlike in graphene\nand carbon nanotubes, in TIs momentum is coupled with\nspin rather than with a (less manipulable) sublattice degree of freedom. The coupling between COM and relative\n\n\f3\ndegrees of freedom creates prospects for spintronics applications, such as a spin-Hall effectR of excitons10 derived\nfrom the Berry connection Aj = i dr\u03c7\u2217 \u2202\u03c7/\u2202Pj .\nAside from P, the z-component of the electron-hole\npair's total angular momentum is also a good quantum\nnumber so long as P = E = \u2206\u2212 = 0. Indeed one can\nreadily verify that limP,E,\u2206\u2212 \u21920 R\u22121 HR = H for R =\nexp(isz \u03c6) exp(ilz \u03c6), where sz = \u03c3ez + \u03c3hz , lz = xpy \u2212 ypx\nand \u03c6 is an arbitrary angle of rotation. In Section III we\nshall take advantage of this U(1) symmetry in order to\nsimplify the calculation of the excitation spectrum.\nAn intriguing peculiarity of topological surface states is\nthat particle-hole asymmetry in the exchange field produces a fictitious electromagnetic vector potential a =\n\u2206\u2212 /vF \u1e91 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0302 for the center-of-mass coordinate. Therefore, the mechanical or physical COM momentum of the\nelectron-hole pair, \u03a0 = P\u2212a, is different from the canonical momentum P = \u2212i~\u2202R . Accordingly, optically excited electron-hole pairs (which are essentially vertical\nacross the bandgap and therefore have P = 0) contain\na nonzero mechanical momentum. As we show in Section IV, the group velocity of these excitons is given by\nvg \u2243 vF (\u2206\u2212 /\u03a9z \u2206+ )\u1e91 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0302 for vF |a| \u226a \u03a9z \u2206+ (which\nimplies vg << vF ), and consequently their motion may\nbe controlled by tilting the direction of magnetization\naway from \u1e91. Admittedly \u2206\u2212 itself is not easily tunable\nin a single topological surface. However, nanoribbons\nwith two Dirac cones (one on each surface) offer a platform wherein \u2206\u2212 is tunable (by changing the relative\nmagnetization of the two surfaces) for spatially indirect\nelectron-hole pairs. In this paper we limit ourselves to\ntopological surfaces with a single Dirac cone.\nIII. ELECTRON-HOLE PAIRS ON A\nTWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE\n\nThis section is devoted to the characterization of optically generated excitons and their photoluminescence on\na two dimensional topological surface with a magnetic\nenergy gap. For simplicity we assume \u2206e = \u2206h = \u2206\nand E = 0. Moreover we take \u2206 = \u2206\u1e91, which involves\nno loss of generality because the in-plane component of\nthe exchange field can be shifted away by redefining a\nnew origin in momentum space. These choices render the\nproblem more easily soluble in momentum space, where\nthe low energy effective Hamiltonian may be written as\nH = H0 + U, with\nX X\nH0 =\nE\u03b1,k \u03a8\u2020\u03b1,k \u03a8\u03b1,k\n\u03b1=c,v k\n\nU =\n\n1 X X 1 (A) \u2020\nV\u03b1 \u03a8\u03b1,k+q\u03a8\u2020\u03b1,k\u2032 \u2212q \u03a8\u03b1,k\u2032 \u03a8\u03b1,k\nL2 \u03b1\n2\n\u2032\nk,k ,q\n\n1 X (E) \u2020\nV \u03a8c,k+q\u03a8\u2020v,k\u2032 \u2212q \u03a8v,k\u2032 \u03a8c,k,\n+ 2\nL\n\u2032\nk,k ,q\n\n(3)\n\np\nEk,c = \u2212Ek,v \u2261 Ek = ~2 vF2 k 2 + \u22062 is the energy dispersion for non-interacting massive Dirac fermions (mass\n\u221d \u2206), and\nV\u03b1(A) = h\u03b1, k + q; \u03b1, k\u2032 \u2212 q|U|\u03b1, k; \u03b1, k\u2032 i\nV (E) = hc, k + q; v, k\u2032 \u2212 q|U|c, k; v, k\u2032 i\n\n(4)\n\nare the intraband and interband Coulomb matrix elements.

In the derivation of Eq. (6)\nwe have treated the interband Coulomb interaction\n(V (E) ) exactly while adopting a mean-field Hartree-Fock\napproximation15 for the intraband interaction (V (A) ).\nA more rigorous analysis requires solving the BetheSalpeter equation.16 Moreover, we have normal-ordered\nthe density operators (: \u03a8\u2020c \u03a8c := \u03a8\u2020c \u03a8c and : \u03a8\u2020v \u03a8v :=\n\u2212\u03a8v \u03a8\u2020v ), and have used \u03a8c |0i = 0 = \u03a8\u2020v |0i.\nThe interband Coulomb matrix element in Eq.

A proper microscopic theory of \u01eb requires the evaluation of a Lindhard function17\nthat includes contributions from both surface and bulk\nelectronic bands. In lieu of a detailed knowledge of the\nfull band structure, we hereafter regard \u01eb as an empirical, momentum-independent quantity. The assumption\nof momentum-independence will be justified a posteriori\n(Figs. (2) and (3)), when we find that \u03c7(k) is peaked at\nk \u2243 0. Due to this, the most important Coulomb matrix elements in Eq. (6) carry a small momentum transfer\n(|k \u2212 k\u2032 | \u2243 0) and accordingly the long-wavelength limit\nof the static dielectric constant furnishes a satisfactory\ndescription of screening.\nIn Eq. (7), the second and last terms within the brackets are unconventional in the sense that they depend on\nthe relative angle between the momenta of the interacting particles. In particular the last term is chiral, i.e.\nsensitive to the relative angular momentum of the interacting particles, and arises purely due to the broken timereversal symmetry (it changes sign under \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u2206.) For\n\u2206 = 0 the Coulomb matrix element agrees with that of\ngraphene. Note also that V (k, k\u2032 ) = V \u2217 (k\u2032 , k). Eq. (7) is\nthe two-particle analog of the skew scattering that contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic\nmetals.18 In that case the probability of scattering off\na nonmagnetic impurity is dependent on the chirality or\nhandedness between the initial and final momenta. In our\ncase, the strength with which an electron and a hole interact is skewed towards a particular sign of their relative\nangular momentum. This has important implications for\nthe exciton binding energies, as we discuss below.\nContinuing with Eq. (6), the renormalization of the\nband-gap in the Hartree-Fock approximation15 is given\nby the difference between self-energies of the conduction\nand valence band:\n\u03b4\u03a3k = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1 X 2\u03c0e2\n|hc, k|v, k\u2032 i|2 \u2212 |hv, k|v, k\u2032 i|2\n2\n\u2032\nL\n\u01eb|k \u2212 k |\n\u2032\nk\n\n1 X 2\u03c0e2 \u22062 + ~2 vF2 k * k\u2032\n= 2\n,\nL\n\u01eb|k \u2212 k\u2032 |\nEk Ek\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(8)\n\nk\n\nwhere a momentum cutoff kc must be introduced in\norder to regularize the ultraviolet divergence that reflects the breakdown of the low-energy effective theory. \u03b4\u03a3k does not depend on the direction of k, and\nthus preserves the rotational symmetry of the problem.\n\u03b4\u03a3k=0 = 2g\u2206 ln(2kc ~vF /\u2206) renormalizes the gap at the\nDirac point, and as expected it vanishes for \u2206 = 0. For\nk \u226b \u2206/(~vF ), \u03b4\u03a3k is generally nonzero even if \u2206 \u2192 0.\nIn order to capture the physical role of the self energy, it\n\n(7)\n\nis illustrative to represent it in operator language,\n\u03b4 \u03a3\u0302 =\n\nX \u03b4\u03a3k\nk\n\n2\n\n(\u03a8\u2020c,k \u03a8c,k \u2212 \u03a8\u2020v,k \u03a8v,k )\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\nX \u03b4\u03a3k \u0010 \u2020\nck,\u2191\n=\nck,\u2191 , c\u2020k,\u2193 \u03c3 * (\u2206\u1e91 + vF \u1e91 \u00d7 k)\n,\nck,\u2193\n2Ek\nk\n\nwhich indicates that Coulomb interactions increase the\nbare Fermi velocity and the bare magnetic gap via\nvF \u2192 vF (1 + \u03b4\u03a3k /2Ek )\n\u2206 \u2192 \u2206(1 + \u03b4\u03a3k /2Ek ).\n\n(9)\n\nFor k \u226a \u2206/(~vF ) this enhancement amounts to up to\n10% of the bare value. Eq. (9) suggests an explanation for\nwhy the Fermi velocity of the topological surface states\nin Bi2 Se3 has been found to decrease19 under Cu doping.\nIn effect, the Coulomb interaction becomes weaker due\nto increased \u01eb and onset of screening by doped carriers,\nand therefore the renormalized Fermi velocity is smaller\nthan for the undoped case.\n\nA.\n\nBound Electron-Hole Pairs\n\nEq. (6) is a hydrogen-like Schrodinger equation for an\nelectron-hole pair with zero COM momentum. As such\nwe expect a solution that will consist of a discrete set of\nbound states (excitons), as well as a continuum of scattering states. Because of the unconventional momentum\ndependence of the Coulomb matrix elements in Eq. (7),\nEq. (6) must be solved numerically. We begin by decomposing the wavefunction into angular momentum channels \u03c7(k) = \u03c7m (k) exp(im\u03c6), which leads to\nZ \u221e \u2032 \u2032\ndk k\n(2Ek +\u03b4\u03a3k )\u03c7m (k)\u2212\nVm (k, k \u2032 )\u03c7m (k \u2032 ) = \u01ebph \u03c7m (k),\n2\u03c0\n0\n(10)\nwhere\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03c6 im\u03c6\n\u2032\ne\nV (k, k\u2032 )\n(11)\nVm (k, k ) =\n2\u03c0\n0\nR\nP\nand we have used (1/L2 ) k \u2192 dk/(2\u03c0)2 . In Eq. (11)\n\u03c6 = \u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6k\u2032 is the angle between k and k\u2032 . While\nEq. (11) is physically meaningful only for k, k \u2032 < kc , the\nrapid decay of the electron-hole wavefunction in momentum space (see below) justifies taking the entire range\nof momenta. It is clear from Eq. (10) that m is a good\nquantum number for electron-hole pairs with vanishing\nCOM momentum. This is the U(1) symmetry identified\n\n\f5\nin the previous section, and accordingly m is the projection of the total angular momentum along the z-axis .\nWe solve Eq. (10) numerically using a modified quadrature method20 that carefully treats the singularity of the\nCoulomb matrix element at k = k\u2032 (see Appendix).\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n\u03c7 (k)\n\nMz\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n\u03b5ph/2\u2206\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\ng\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nk aB\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n1\n0.5\n\n3\nrenormalized bandgap\nm=-1\nm=0\nm=1\n\ng=0.1\ng=0.3\ng=0.4\n\n2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\ng\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nFIG. 1: Excitation energies as a function of the dimensionless Coulomb coupling g = (e2 /\u01eb)/(2~vF ), for an electron-hole\npair located at the surface of a TI with a magnetic gap. m\nis the quantum number for the projection of the total angular momentum along the z-axis and Eg = 2\u2206 + \u03b4\u03a3k=0 is the\nrenormalized energy gap. As derived in the text, the renormalized gap grows linearly with g, and its precise magnitude\ndepends logarithmically on an ultraviolet momentum cutoff.\nThe exciton binding energy is given by Eg \u2212 \u01ebph and is found\nto obey Eq. (13). For each m, only the lowest-lying bound\nstate is shown. In the weak coupling regime (which is relevant for most TIs discovered to date) the m = \u22121 exciton\nhas the largest binding energy. However, the m = 0 channel\nis most prone to an excitonic instability (at g \u2243 0.4). The\ncritical value of g for the instability can be roughly estimated\nfrom Eq. (13) via \u01ebb (g \u2192 gc ) \u2243 2\u2206, or else from dimensional\narguments outlined in the text.\n\nIn Fig. (1) we plot the energy of the lowest lying exciton states for different values of m. At weak Coulomb\ncoupling the binding energy is largest for m = \u22121, and\nthe excitation energies for m = 1 and m = \u22121 are\ndifferent. Such asymmetry in the sign of the angular\nmomentum stems from the aforementioned chirality of\nthe Coulomb matrix element (Eq. (7)), which enhances\nthe electron-hole attraction for angular momenta aligned\nwith the Zeeman field \u2206\u1e91. As such, m and \u2212m are interchangeable via \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u2206. This is all in stark contrast\nto conventional hydrogen-like excitons. In ordinary twodimensional excitons with a reduced effective mass meff ,\nthe binding energy is given by \u01ebb = E0 /(n + 1/2)2, where\nn = 0, 1, 2, ..., E0 = (meff /me \u01eb2 )13.6eV and me is the\nbare electron mass. It is instructive to write down the\nexpression for the largest binding energy of conventional\n\nFIG. 2: Momentum space wave function for the lowest-lying\nelectron-hole pair with m = 0. aB = ~vF /(\u2206g) is an effective Bohr radius (the effective mass in the parabollic band\napproximation\nis \u2206/2vF2 ). The wavefunction (normalized\nR\u221e\nthrough 0 d\u03ba\u03ba|\u03c7m (\u03ba)|2 = 1, where \u03ba = kaB ) is peaked at\nkaB \u223c O(1) (~vF k/\u2206 \u223c g \u226a 1), and its spread in momentum\nspace increases as interactions become stronger. Inset: the\nz-component of the spin density for the same exciton state.\nWeakly interacting particle-hole pairs are spin polarized along\nthe direction normal to the surface. This spin projection decreases abruptly in the vicinity of the excitonic instability.\n\nexcitons with a given value of the angular momentum m:\n\u01ebmax\nb,m =\n\nE0\n(ordinary 2D excitons).\n(|m| + 1/2)2\n\n(12)\n\nThe decrease in the binding energy of the strongest\nbound exciton with m may be interpreted by invoking\na centrifugal potential that reduces the effective attraction between the electron and the hole for higher angular\nmomentum channels. In contrast to Eq. (12), our numerical analysis for excitons on topological surfaces gives\n\u1ebc0\n(topological 2D excitons),\n(|m + 1| + 1/2)2\n(13)\n2\nwhere \u1ebc0 = \u03b1\u2206g and \u03b1 is a constant of order one. \u2206g 2\nis the Coulomb energy scale corresponding to electronhole pairs with a reduced effective mass \u2206/2vF2 . This\nmass agrees with the inverse of the non-interacting band\ncurvature at k = 0. The remarkable difference between\nEq. (12) and Eq. (13) is a shift in the angular momentum quantum number (i.e. m \u2192 m + 1), which is consistent with the nontrivial Berry phase of the topological\nsurface states. Given their maximal binding energy for\nm = \u22121 as well as their asymmetry under m \u2192 \u2212m,\nthe excitons occurring at topological surfaces with magnetic order can be described as \"p-wave\" and \"chiral\".\nAs we show below, these unconventional features may be\noptically detectable.\n\u01ebmax\nb,m =\n\n\f6\n\n3.5\n\nm=1\nm=-1\nm=0\n\n3\n2.5\n\n\u03c7\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nk aB\n\nFIG. 3: Momentum space wave function for the lowest-lying\nelectron-hole pair with g = 0.1 and m = 1, 0, \u22121. The m =\n\u22121 exciton wavefunction is more spread out in momentum\nspace, which is partly why the corresponding binding energy\nis larger.\n\nFor g \u2243 0.1 and \u2206 \u2243 20meV, the binding energy for\nthe lowest-lying exciton is about 1meV. Though small,\nthis binding energy is comparable to that of biexcitons in\nGaAs quantum wells, which have been seen in photoluminescence experiments.21 In the next subsection we show\nthat excitonic features in the optical absorption spectrum\ncan be noticeable even for g \u2243 0.05 and \u2206 \u2243 10meV.\nFor larger Coulomb coupling (g & 0.4), the binding energy for the m = 0 exciton surpasses that of the m = \u22121\nexciton, and leads to an excitonic instability towards an\n\"s-wave\" Bose condensate. The critical value of g for the\nonset of the excitonic instability can be estimated from\ndimensional analysis. At zero temperature and when\nthe Fermi energy is in the gap, the only lengthscale22\nfor non-interacting electrons is \u03be\u2206 = ~vF /\u2206, whereas\nthe only lengthscale related to Coulomb interactions is\n\u03bee = e2 /(\u01eb\u2206). The validity of our calculations is limited to the weakly interacting regime where \u03bee \u226a \u03be\u2206 . In\ncontrast, when \u03bee \u226b \u03be\u2206 the single-exciton approximation breaks down and the physics is governed by manybody interactions. Therefore the excitonic instability occurs at \u03bee \u2243 \u03be\u2206 , which yields gc \u2243 0.5. This value\nagrees well with the numerical results of Fig. (1). For\nvF \u2243 4 \u00d7 105 m/s, g = 2.72/\u01eb and thus the excitonic instability is reached at \u01eb \u2243 7. At present we are not aware\nof any TI that has such a small value of the dielectric\nconstant at its surface.\nFig. (2) illustrates the wavefunction for the m = 0\nexciton in momentum space. Most of its weight is concentrated at kaB . O(1), where aB = ~vF /(\u2206g) is an\neffective Bohr radius. For strongly interacting electronhole pairs, the wavefunctions become more delocalized\nin momentum space. This trend reflects the tendency of\nthe electron and the hole to stay close to one another\n\nin real space, so as to optimize the Coulomb interaction. The inset of Fig. (2) shows the spin density of the\nm = 0 exciton. In the non-interacting case, the spinor\nof the conduction band at momentum k is perfectly antialigned with respect to that of the valence band. Therefore, non-interacting particle-hole excitations are spinful.\nThe x- and y-components of the spin density vanish by\nsymmetry, while the z-component of the spin density for\nelectron-hole pair with angular momentum m is\nX Z dkk \u2206\n1\n|\u03c7nm (k)|2 , (14)\nMz = hxc|\u03c3ez +\u03c3hz |xci =\n2\n2\u03c0\nE\nk\nn\nwhere n labels the different eigenstates for a given value\nof m. As evidenced by Fig. (2), Mz varies little as a\nfunction of g up until g \u2243 gc . It is sensible that the spinpolarization of electron-hole pairs be largely immune to\nweak Coulomb interactions, because the latter are spinrotationally invariant.\nIn Fig. (3) we plot the momentum space wave functions for the m = 1, 0, \u22121 excitons. The m = \u22121\n(m = 1) eigenstate is most (least) delocalized in momentum space. This is a consequence of the chirality in\nthe Coulomb interaction, which makes the electron-hole\nattraction largest for m = \u22121 and smallest for m = 1.\nHence the m = \u22121 wavefunction is more delocalized in\nmomentum space.\nB.\n\nOptical Absorption\n\nThe knowledge of particle-hole excitation energies and\nwavefunctions at P = 0 provides a gateway for determining the optical conductivity23,24 of topological surface\nstates whose chemical potential is placed inside a magnetic energy gap. From Fermi's golden rule, the optical\nabsorption for photons of frequency \u03c9 is\nR(\u03c9) =\n\n2\u03c0 X\ne\n(\u03b1)\n|h\u03b1| A * v|0i|2 \u03b4(\u01ebph \u2212 ~\u03c9),\n~ \u03b1\nc\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the set of quantum numbers describing a\nparticle-hole excitation and |0i is the ground state in\nabsence of particle-hole excitations. Ignoring electric\nfields (which are included in the next section) we have\n\u03b1 \u2192 (n, m), where m refers to the angular momentum\nquantum number and n counts the different eigenstates\nfor a given m. v = \u2202H0 /~\u2202k = vF (\u03c3 \u00d7 \u1e91) is the velocity operator for non-interacting electrons (we neglect\nthe renormalization of the Fermi velocity due to interactions), A is the vector potential and\nX\nh\u03b1|v i |0i =\n\u03c7nm (k)eim\u03c6 hck|v i |vki\n(16)\nk\n\nis the electric dipole transition matrix element.\nBecause [v, H0 ] 6= 0, the velocity operator induces interband transitions and is able to produce magnetized\nexcitons. The optical absorption vanishes for A = A\u1e91\n\n\f7\n\n\u221a\n\u03b8k\nhck|v + |vki = \u2212 2ivF ei\u03c6k cos2\n2\n\u221a\n2 \u03b8k\n\u2212\n\u2212i\u03c6k\nhck|v |vki = \u2212 2ivF e\nsin\n,\n(18)\n2\n\u221a\nwhere v \u00b1 = (v x \u00b1 iv y )/ 2. Thus only the m = \u22121\n(m = 1) exciton is optically active for right- (left-) circularly polarized light. In Figs. (4) and (5) we plot the\noptical absorption for linearly and circularly polarized\nlight. We incorporate the finite lifetime of the excitons\nby broadening the Dirac delta function \u03b4(\u01ebn,m \u2212 ~\u03c9) into\na Lorentzian\n(n,m)\n\n\u03b4(\u01ebph\n\n\u2212 ~\u03c9) \u2192\n\n\u03b3/2\n(n,m)\n(\u01ebph\n\n\u2212 ~\u03c9)2 + \u03b3 2 /4\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the linewidth. We have taken \u03b3 \u2243 0.6meV,\nwhich is fairly small but commonly obtained in a variety\nof semiconducting quantum wells.26\nIn the non-interacting case the optical absorption increases linearly at frequencies above the gap; this is simply a manifestation of the Dirac-like density-of-states.\nFor frequencies in the vicinity of the gap, electron-hole interactions enhance the optical absorption. When the surface is irradiated with either linearly polarized or rightcircularly polarized light, an excitonic absorption peak is\nvisible even in samples with modest gaps (\u2206 \u2243 10meV)\nand weak interactions (g \u2243 0.05 or \u01eb \u2243 50). Part of the\nreason for this prominent excitonic peak is that the \"coherence factor\" cos2 (\u03b8/2) in Eqs.

It follows from Eqs. (16)\nand (17) that only m = 1 and m = \u22121 states are optically\nactive for linearly polarized light, whereas the m = 0\nexciton is dark. This selection rule differs from ordinary\nhydrogen-like excitons and even from excitons in many\ntopologically trivial spin-orbit coupled systems, wherein\nm = 0 is a bright exciton. It is likewise different from\n25\nthe optical selection rules in gated bilayer graphene.\n\u221a\nFor circularly polarized light (A = A(x\u0302 \u00b1 i\u0177)/ 2) we\nhave\n\n10\n\n10\n5\n0\n-6 -4 -2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n\u03c9-Eg (meV)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4: Optical absorption for linearly polarized light, as\na function of the dimensionless Coulomb coupling g. \u2206 =\n20meV, \u03b3 = 0.6meV, and R0 is the absorption coefficient for\nfree electron-hole pairs at \u03c9 = 2\u2206.

Consequently,\nthe absorption spectrum of left-circularly polarized light\nshows no significant excitonic peaks and the absolute intensity of absorption near the bandgap is much smaller\n(Fig. (5)). Such a large asymmetry between left- and\nright-circularly polarized light should be experimentally\ntestable. Keeping in mind that right- and left-circularly\npolarized absorption spectra map onto one another under \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u2206, one simple way to detect the asymmetry\nbetween them is by shining circularly polarized light and\nthen switching the direction of magnetization at the surface of the topological insulator by 180\u25e6.\nWe finalize this section with a few caveats on how to facilitate the experimental detection of the aforementioned\nphenomena. On one hand, the magnetic overlay must be\na charge insulator with an optical gap that is large compared to the energy gap of the surface states. This requirement is clearly fulfilled in magnetic ions (e.g. Fe3+ ,\nMn2+ ) or in magnetic semiconductors such as27 EuO,\nwhich have O(1eV) bandgaps. On the other hand, light\ncan excite spatially uniform magnons in the ferromagnetic overlay. However, the typical energy scale for these\ncollective excitations28 is 0.05meV \u226a 2\u2206, and therefore\nthe magnon absorption lines will be well separated from\nexcitonic features. Perhaps the most convenient system\nfor testing our predictions is Bi2 Se3 with Fe and Mn ions\ndoped in the bulk or at the surface.8 Bulk Mn doping\nleads to \u2206 \u223c 7meV at 1% doping; substantially larger\nmagnetic gaps have been reported through increase in\n\n\f8\n\n30\n\nR (\u03c9)/R0\n\nL-handed\nR-handed\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n\n20\n\n0.02\n-2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n\u03c9-Eg (meV)\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFIG. 5: Optical absorption for circularly polarized light.\ng = 0.12, \u2206 = 15meV and \u03b3 = 0.6meV.

For rightcircularly polarized light the most strongly bound exciton\n(m = \u22121) is optically bright.

ELECTRON-HOLE PAIRS ON A\nONE-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE\n\nThus far we have considered two dimensional surfaces\nwith translational and rotational symmetry. In this section we concentrate on a one-dimensional variant of the\ninteracting two-body problem (Eq. (1)), which is pertinent to the surface of a quasi-one-dimensional TI. The\nmotivation for this investigation lies in the well-known\nfact that excitonic effects are stronger in reduced dimensions. Besides, the one-dimensional model is numerically\nsimple enough to allow us to learn with relative ease how\nexcitonic effects are altered under external electric fields\nas well as in presence of a finite COM momentum for the\nelectron-hole pairs. In regards to the latter, some of the\nresults derived in this section (e.g. Eq. (22)) are relevant\nfor two dimensional surfaces.\nThe low-energy band structure for the surface states\nof a cylindrical TI nanowire29 is\nEk,m = \u00b1~vF\n\ns\n\nk2 +\n\n(m + 1/2 \u2212 \u03bd)2\n,\nr02\n\n(20)\n\nwhere k is the momentum along the axis of the cylinder, m is the azimuthal projection of the total angular\nmomentum, \u03bd is the magnetic flux (in units of the flux\nquantum) that threads the cross section of the nanowire,\nand r0 is the radius of the wire. For \u03bd = 0, the energy spectrum at the surface is gapped and all energy\nlevels are doubly degenerate (Ek,m=\u22121 = Ek,m=0 ). For\n\u03bd = 1/2, m = 0 constitutes a gapless, non-degenerate,\ntopological surface state. When \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1/2) the surface\nspectrum is gapped but the lowest-lying energy states\nare non-degenerate; this is the situation for which the\ncalculation of the present section applies. It follows from\nEq. (20) that the bandgap for non-interacting electrons\nis 2\u2206 = (2~vF /r0 )|\u03bd \u2212 1/2|, which is tunable by an external magnetic field along the axis of the cylinder. Another way to open a uniform energy gap is to coat the\nnanowire with a radially magnetized ferromagnet, though\nthis is experimentally cumbersome. \u03bd \u2243 1/2 is achievable\nwith magnetic fields B . 10T even for radii as small as\nr0 \u2243 10nm. When \u03bd \u2243 1/2, it is a good approximation\nto focus on the m = 0 state only, because it is well separated (at least near k = 0) from higher energy states.\nFor instance, Ek=0,m=\u22121 = 3Ek=0,m=0 for \u03bd = 1/4. For\n\u03bd \u2243 1/4 and r0 \u2243 10nm, \u2206 \u223c O(10meV) is comparable\nto the magnitude of the exchange field considered in the\nprevious section.\nWhen E 6= 0 the problem at hand contains no symmetries other than the conservation of the COM canonical momentum P . Hence it is more convenient to solve\nthe two-body Dirac equation in real space. Our starting\nmodel for the surface of a TI nanowire with radius r0 and\nlength L is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2206\nvF\n\u03a9\u0302\n(\u03c3e + \u03c3h ) * \u2212px\u0302 +\nH = \u2212vF (\u03c3ex \u2212 \u03c3hx ) P +\n2\nvF\n2\ne\n\u2212 eEy,\n(21)\n\u2212\n\u01eb(|y| + \u03b7r0 )\nwhere we have defined the axis of the cylinder to be\nthe y-axis and y \u2208 (\u2212L, L) is the relative coordinate\nalong the wire. The regularized form of the Coulomb\ninteraction in Eq. (21) can be derived by averaging the\nthree-dimensional Coulomb potential with radial envelope functions.24 \u03b7 is a positive fitting parameter that\ntakes the value of 0.3 in certain idealizations of wires.\nWe solve Eq. (21) as an eigenvalue problem in real\nspace, with the boundary conditions chosen so that the\nwavefunction vanishes at the ends of the wire. Starting\nfrom the non-interacting problem with P = E = e2 /\u01eb =\n0, we keep only a quarter of eigenvalues and eigenstates.\nThese correspond to particle-hole pairs with positive excitation energies \u01ebph \u2265 2\u2206, namely a hole in the valence\nband and an electron in the conduction band. Thereafter we analyze how these energy levels (and eigenstates)\nchange under Coulomb interactions, electric fields and\nCOM momenta. The eigenvalues and eigenstates we discard describe (i) a valence band hole and a valence band\nelectron, (ii) a conduction band electron and a conduc-\n\n\f9\ntion band hole, (iii) a conduction band hole and a valence\nband electron.\n0.35\n\n\u03b5ph (meV)\n\n14\n\n3\n\n\u03b5b / 2 \u2206\n\n\u03b7=0.3\n\u03b7=0.6\n\n16\n\n\u03b5ph/2\u2206\n\n4\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2\n\nvF P/ 2 \u2206\n\n2\n\n12\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n8\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nvF P / 2\u2206\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\ng\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 6: Lowest-lying particle-hole excitation energy for a TI\nnanowire of radius r0 = 10nm, length L = 100nm and ~vF =\n300meVnm. In our numerical calculation, each discrete step\nalong the wire equals 1 nm. The magnetic flux along the axis\nof the wire is \u03bd = 1/4 in units of the flux quantum, which leads\nto a non-interacting bandgap of 2\u2206 = 15meV. For smaller\nvalues of the fitting parameter \u03b7, the exciton binding energies\nbecome larger.\n\nIn Fig. (6) we plot the lowest lying particle-hole excitation energy as a function of g, for E = \u03a9x = \u03a9y = P = 0.\nNarrower wires show larger exciton binding energies: for\nwires of radius \u223c 10nm they may be \u223c 3 \u2212 5 times larger\nthan the binding energies of the two dimensional excitons\nstudied in the previous section.\nIn Fig. (7) we display the influence of P 6= 0 and radial\nexchange fields in the particle-hole excitation energy (azimuthal exchange fields amount to a shift in p and are inconsequential). The binding energy has a non-monotonic\ndependence on P ; this is markedly different from conventional systems wherein the COM and relative coordinates are decoupled and thus the exciton binding energy\nis independent of P (at least in absence of quantizing\nmagnetic fields). For P \u226a \u2206/vF , excitons are formed\npredominantly out of electrons (holes) located near the\nbottom (top) of the non-interacting conduction (valence)\nband. Accordingly we find \u01ebph (P ) \u2243 \u01ebph (0) + P 2 /(2M ),\nwhere the exciton mass is given by M = \u2206/(2vF2 ). As\nP increases, the particles and holes forming the exciton\nnecessarily explore the linear part of the non-interacting\nenergy-momentum dispersion. Thereby excitons become\nheavier; in fact for P \u226b \u2206/vF we obtain \u2202\u01ebph /\u2202P \u2243 2vF ,\nwhich translates to infinitely massive particle-hole pairs.\nThe observations from the preceding paragraph are\nalso applicable to the two-dimensional magneto-excitons\ndiscussed in Section II. Yet unlike in nanowires, in twodimensional topological surfaces the magnetic gap is generated by exchange interactions. These exchange in-\n\nFIG. 7: Lowest-lying particle-hole excitation energy as a function of the canonical COM momentum P . L = 100nm,\n\u2206\u2212 = 0 and g = 0.12. The dependence of the particle-hole energy on P is quadratic at P \u226a \u2206/vF (light excitons) and becomes linear as P \u226b \u2206/vF (heavy excitons). When \u2206\u2212 6= 0,\nthe dispersion is shifted. A nearly identical dispersion is obtained (not shown) as a function of a radial exchange field hy\nthat couples to \u03c3ey + \u03c3hy . The effect ofpthis exchange field is\nto renormalize the bandap via \u2206 \u2192 \u22062 + h2y . Azimuthal\nexchange fields (which couple to \u03c3ex + \u03c3hx ) amount to a redefinition of the origin in momentum space and do not change the\nparticle-hole excitation spectrum. Inset: The exciton binding\nenergy has a non-trivial dependence on P .\n\nteractions are generally asymmetric between electrons\nand holes. An interesting consequence of this asymmetry is that it introduces a mechanical COM momentum\n\u03a0 = P\u2212\u2206\u2212 /vF \u1e91\u00d7\u03a9, where \u2206\u2212 denotes the difference in\nthe exchange fields between electrons and holes (see Section II for the definition of \u2206\u00b1 ). When \u2206\u2212 6= 0, Fig. (7)\nremains valid insofar as P is replaced by \u03a0 in the horizontal axis. As a result optically generated excitons (i.e.\nP = 0 excitons) carry a nonzero COM group velocity in\npresence of in-plane exchange fields:\n\u2202\u01ebph (P)\n\u2206\u2212\n\u1e91 \u00d7 \u03a9\u0302.\n= vF\nP \u21920\n\u2202P\n\u03a9z \u2206+\n\nvg = lim\n\n(22)\n\nEq.

This nonzero group velocity of optically excited excitons, combined with their nonzero spin polarization along the z-axis (see Eq. (14) and the discussion\ntherein), opens prospects for creating excitonic spin currents and spin Hall effects. Similarly, by tilting \u03a9\u0302 away\nfrom \u1e91 one can map the excitonic dispersion relation\n(Fig. (7)) optically.30\nFinally, we investigate the photoluminescence\n(Eq.

Throughout this\nstudy we have encountered a number of potentially interesting properties. First, optically excited electronhole pairs are magnetized in the direction perpendicular to the topological surface. Second, the relative motion of an electron-hole pair is entangled to the center-ofmass motion. Accordingly, the excitonic Berry phase is\nnonzero and a spin-Hall effect of excitons ensues. Third,\nCoulomb interactions enhance both the Fermi velocity\nand the mass of Dirac fermions. Fourth, in two dimensional topological surfaces, the combination of spin-orbit\ninteraction and broken time reversal symmetry leads to\na skewness or chirality in the effective Coulomb interaction between an electron and a hole. The underlying cause for this chirality resides in the nonzero Berry\nphase of the topological surface states. Consequently, the\nstrongest bound state occurs for an electron-hole pair\nwhose total angular momentum has a projection ~ (or\n\u2212~, depending on the direction of magnetization at the\nsurface) along the normal to the surface. This \"p-wave\"\nand \"chiral\" exciton becomes optically bright upon shining circularly polarized light with the proper handedness,\nand is optically dark upon shining of circularly polarized\nlight with the opposite handedness. For fixed handedness\nof the impinging light, bright-to-dark transitions can be\ninduced by switching the direction of magnetization by\n\n\f11\n180\u25e6 . Fifth, so long as there is an electron-hole asymmetry in the exchange coupling between topological surface\nstates and magnetic ions, optically excited electron-hole\npairs have a nonzero center-of-mass group velocity that\nmay be tuned by tilting the magnetization away from the\nnormal of the surface.\nMany of the anticipated peculiarities may be experimentally accessible in topological surfaces that\nhost weak-to-moderate Coulomb interactions (g =\n(e2 /\u01eb)/(2~vF ) & 0.1), promote sufficiently long exciton\nlifetimes, and have their chemical potential in the energy\ngap (both in bulk and at the surface). If the chemical potential intersects the topological surface bands, an\noptical gap will certainly be still present. Nonetheless,\nexcitonic effects will be substantially weakened because\nexciton binding energies31 and lifetimes32 both decrease\nrapidly in the metallic regime.\nAside from the task of characterizing magneto-excitons\nthat form between Landau levels under perpendicular\nmagnetic fields, we can envision various directions along\nwhich the work presented here can be expanded. On\none hand, it will be interesting to consider ultrathin TI\nribbons, wherein two Dirac cones (one on each surface)\nand spatially indirect excitons might contribute to photoluminescence. On the other hand, full-fledged elec-\n\ntronic structure calculations of the topological surface\nstates will be crucial33 in order to make quantitative contact with optical measurements that are likely to be performed in the foreseeable future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI.G. acknowledges useful comments from I.

The first term in Eq. (A2) is evaluated numerically after shifting k\u0303 \u2032 so as to\nremove the Coulomb singularity. In the numerical evaluation of Eq. (A1) we take N = 256; higher values of N do not\nproduce any significant quantitative changes.\n\n1\n\nM.Z. Hasan and C.L. Kane, Rev. Mod. Phys. 82, 3045\n(2010); X.-L. Qi and S.-C.

The exciton binding energy is significantly depleted as soon as kF > 1/aB = g\u2206/~vF , where\nkF is the Fermi momentum of the doped surface states.\nThis is a consequence of the exciton wave function having\nmost of its weight near the bottom of the conduction band\nand the top of the valence band (kaB . 1).\nWhen the surface bands have a Fermi surface, excitons can\ndecay into low-energy particle-hole pairs near kF .
