In such systems,\nthe coexistence of superconducting and magnetic correlations may lead to a variety of interesting physical effects. The\nexchange splitting of the Fermi level3 in the ferromagnet breaks the spin degeneracy, and Andreev-reflected Cooper\npairs acquire a finite momentum, which produces oscillations of the Cooper-pair wave function. By tuning the geometric and electronic parameters, one can realize SFS junctions in which the superconducting order parameter is of\nopposite sign in the two S electrodes.4 Such a \u03c0 state manifests itself in a reversal of the sign of the critical current\nas the thickness of the ferromagnets is varied.1 The characteristic thickness at which the first 0\u2013\u03c0 transition occurs is\nof the order of the magnetic coherence length\np \u03beh . In the diffusive limit, which is realized in most experimentally fabricated SF heterostructures, \u03beh is given by D/h where D denotes the diffusion constant and h is the ferromagnetic\nexchange energy. Therefore, the experimental observation of such 0\u2013\u03c0 transitions in nanoscale devices requires a low\nexchange energy h. This stringent condition was achieved using weak ferromagnetic CuNi or PdNi alloys.5,6,7,8\nThe physics of single-domain SFS junctions (including the effect of spin-flip9,10,11 and spin-orbit scattering3,12,13 )\nis now well understood. However, in some experiments the 0\u2013\u03c0 transition points may deviate from standard\npredictions8,14 or even be absent.15,16 There is no consensus on the interpretation of such deviations. It may be\nattributed either to the presence of a magnetically dead layer at the interface between the superconductor and the\nferromagnet,8,17 or to a domain structure or inhomogeneities in the ferromagnetic layer. The domain structure crucially depends on the nature of the ferromagnet: strong ferromagnets consist of well-defined magnetic domains whose\nspatial extension may be reduced by the proximity effect18,19,20,21 . In weakly ferromagnetic alloys, on the other hand,\nthe magnetization may fluctuate on short length scales without forming domains.22\nTheoretically, SFS junctions with inhomogeneous magnetization have been studied recently in different\nsetups.23,24,25,26,27,28 However, in most works (except for Refs. 27,28) only domains along the junction were studied\n(quasi-one-dimensional geometry), while in the experimental realizations of SFS junctions with thin F layers the\ndomain structure is more likely to form in the plane of the F film.\nMotivated by the experimental progress on \u03c0 junctions, we study a model of a diffusive SFS junction with in-plane\ndomains (so that the domain walls are orthogonal to the S and F layers, see Fig. 1). This geometry has been studied\npreviously by Volkov and Anishchanka within the macroscopic approach of London equations.28 Our model is different\nfrom the one studied in Ref. 27: in that work, the Neel domain walls are considered, and the junction is brought to the\nregime with only the long-range triplet component contributing to the Josephson current. In our model, the domain\nwalls are taken to be sharp, and no long-range triplet component appears for domains with antiparallel magnetization.\nThe domain structure introduces an additional length scale: the domain size a. As one can expect, we find that the\neffect of inhomogeneous magnetization depends strongly on the relative magnitude of a and \u03beh . In the limit of small\ndomains, a \u226a \u03beh , the exchange field effectively averages out, and the critical current of a single nonmagnetic SNS\njunction is retrieved. In the opposite limit of large domains a \u226b \u03beh , the influence of domain walls is localized to their\nvicinity and produces only a small correction to the current of a single-domain SFS junction. Between those limits,\nthe supercurrent shows either a damped oscillatory behavior as a function of the junction thickness (for large domains\na > ac \u2248 0.83 \u03beh ), or a monotonic exponential decay (for smaller domains a < ac ). In the former case, the multidomain\n\n\f2\n\na\n\nF\n\nd\nh = -e z\n\nS\u03c7\ni\n\n\u0394e\n\nF\n\nS\u03c7\n-i\n\n\u0394e\n\nh = e z ey\nex\n\nFIG. 1: SFS junction with in-plane magnetic domains\n\njunction may be compared to a single-domain SFS trilayer with spin-flip scattering12 and a renormalized exchange\nfield, whereas in the latter case the junction behaves like a SNS junction with spin-flip scattering. The effective\nparameters are determined analytically in both limits of small and large domains. We also study the inhomogeneous\ndistribution of the current density and conjecture that at low temperatures such SFS junctions with domains may\nrealize the intermediate \u03c6 phase proposed by Buzdin.29\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we compute the superconducting Green functions and the Josephsoncurrent density for the multidomain SFS junction. Section III is devoted to the analysis of the total Josephson current.\nIn Section IV we discuss the spatial distribution of the current density. Finally, in Section V we summarize our\nconclusions.\nII.\n\nA MODEL FOR THE MULTIDOMAIN SFS JUNCTION\n\nWe assume that the ferromagnetic layer is strongly disordered, and the motion of electrons is diffusive. In this regime,\nthe Green functions are given by the solutions to the Usadel equations.30 To simplify the calculations, we further\nassume that the junction is close to the superconducting critical temperature Tc . In this case, the superconducting\ncorrelations are weak so that the Usadel equations can be linearized, and the current-phase relation is sinusoidal31\nJ = Jc sin \u03c6 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = 2\u03c7 is the superconducting phase difference across the junction and Jc is the critical current. The sign of\nJc determines if the junction is in the \"zero\" phase or in the \"\u03c0\" phase.\nIn this paper, we consider a SFS junction with in-plane ferromagnetic domains of opposite magnetization. We\nintroduce a coordinate system with the F layer in the yz plane (Fig. 1). The x axis is directed along the junction,\nand the SF interfaces correspond to the coordinates x = 0, d. The domain walls are taken to be normal to the y axis.\nThe origin of the y axis is chosen at the interface between two domains. The system is invariant under translation\nalong the z axis. Our further calculations will be equally applicable to either the system with two domains of width\na (see Fig. 1) or the 2a-periodic multidomain case (the same setup periodically repeated in the y direction).\nThe (nonlinear) Usadel equation in the ferromagnetic layer takes the form (we follow the conventions used in Ref.\n32)\nD\u2207 (\u01e7\u2207\u01e7) \u2212 \u03c9 [\u03c4\u03023 \u03c3\u03020 , \u01e7] \u2212 i [\u03c4\u03023 (h * \u03c3\u0302) , \u01e7] = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere D denotes the diffusion constant and the system of units with ~ = kB = \u03bcB = 1 is chosen. The Green function\n\u01e7 is a matrix in the Nambu \u2297 spin space, \u03c4\u0302\u03b1 and \u03c3\u0302\u03b1 denote the Pauli matrices respectively in Nambu (particle-hole)\nand spin space, \u03c9 = (2n + 1) \u03c0T are the Matsubara frequencies and h is the exchange field in the ferromagnet. The\nUsadel equation is supplemented with the normalization condition for the quasiclassical Green function\n\u01e7 2 = 1\u030c = \u03c4\u03020 \u03c3\u03020 .\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nFor simplicity, we assume that the superconductors are much less disordered than the ferromagnet, and then we can\nimpose the rigid boundary conditions at the SF interfaces,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c9\n\u2206e\u00b1i\u03c7\n\u2297 \u03c3\u03020 ,\n(4)\n\u01e7 = \u221a\n\u2213i\u03c7\n\u2212\u03c9\n\u03c9 2 + \u22062 \u2212\u2206e\nNambu\nwhere \u2206 denotes the superconducting order parameter, and the different signs refer respectively to the boundary\nconditions at x = 0 and x = d. At the (transparent) interface between the two ferromagnetic domains, we impose the\ncontinuity of the Green functions and of their derivatives.\nClose to the critical temperature Tc , we linearize the Usadel equations (2), (3) around the solution for the normal\nmetal state \u01e7 = \u03c4\u03023 \u03c3\u03020 sgn(\u03c9). The linearized Green function then takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c30 sgn(\u03c9)\nf\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1\n\u01e7 =\n,\n(5)\n\u2212f\u03b1\u2020 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u2212\u03c30 sgn(\u03c9)\nwhere the scalar f0 (respectively f0\u2020 ) and vector f (respectively f \u2020 ) components of the anomalous Green functions\nobey the linear equations\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u22022\n1(\u2020)\n1(\u2020)\n(6)\n+ 2 f\u00b1 \u2212 \u03bb2\u00b1 f\u00b1 = 0,\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y\nwith\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n|\u03c9| \u2213 ihsgn(\u03c9)\n\u03bb\u00b1 = 2\n.\nD\n\n(7)\n\nThe projections of the anomalous Green function along the direction of the exchange field (\"parallel\" components)\n(\u2020)\n(\u2020)\nare defined as f\u00b1 (x, y) = f0 \u00b1 f (\u2020) * ez (we assume that the ferromagnetic exchange field h is aligned in the direction\nez , see Fig. 1). Note that there is no perpendicular (\"long-range triplet\"33 ) component of the vector part of the Green\nfunction, since the magnetizations of the domains are collinear. We have used the invariance under translation along\nthe z direction. The superscript 1 refers to domains with field along ez and in the following we will use the superscript\n2(\u2020)\n2 for domains with the field along \u2212ez . Similar equations hold for f\u00b1 with \u03bb\u00b1 \u2194 \u03bb\u2213 .\nIt is convenient to write the solutions to those equations in the form\n(\u2020)1,2\n\nf\u00b1\n\n(\u2020)1,2\n\n(\u2020)1,2\n\n(x, y) = f\u00b1Bulk (x) + \u03b4\u00b1\n\n(x, y)\n\n(8)\n\n1,2\nwhere f\u00b1Bulk\nare the solutions of Eq. (6) for a single-domain SFS junction with the magnetization along ez (respectively \u2212ez ). Since the equations (6) are linear, the correction \u03b4(x, y) is also a solution to the same equations with the\nboundary conditions\n1,2\n\u2202y \u03b4\u00b1\n(x, y = \u2213a) = 0,\n\n1,2\n\u03b4\u00b1\n(x = {0, d}, y) = 0,\n2\n1\n\u03b4\u00b1 (x, y = 0) \u2212 \u03b4\u00b1\n(x, y = 0) = \u2206f\u00b1Bulk (x),\n1\n2\n(x, y = 0) = 0.\n[\u2202y ] \u03b4\u00b1 (x, y = 0) \u2212 [\u2202y ] \u03b4\u00b1\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n\n2\n1\nHere \u2206f\u00b1Bulk = f\u00b1Bulk\n(x) \u2212 f\u00b1Bulk\n(x) is the difference of the bulk Green functions in the two domains. For the twodomain junction, the first condition imposes zero current at the interface with vacuum, the second condition ensures\nthe continuity of the Green functions at the SF interfaces. Finally, the last two conditions reflect the continuity of the\nGreen function and its derivatives at the interface between the two domains.

Using the\nexpression for the Green functions (16) and (17), we can obtain a general expression for the current density (which is too\ncumbersome to be reproduced here). This expression involves two contributions. The first one is produced exclusively\nby the bulk Green functions (17) and corresponds to a homogeneous ferromagnetic interlayer. The second contribution\nis due to the correction (16) and reflects the influence of the domain structure.

Far from the interface between the domains (y \u226b min(\u03beT , \u03beh , d)), the\ncorrection (16) vanishes and we recover locally the single-domain SFS current. Thus we expect the properties of the\njunction to be very different in the two limits of small [a \u226a min(\u03beT , \u03beh , d)] and large [a \u226b min(\u03beT , \u03beh , d)] domains.\nIII.\n\nCRITICAL CURRENT\n\nExperimentally, in SFS hybrid junctions, the measurable quantity is the total current flowing through the junction,\nthat is along the x-axis.

The second term reflects the influence of the domain structure.\nThe critical current (20) depends on the three dimensionless parameters: a/\u03beh , d/\u03beh , and \u03beT /\u03beh . For some values of\nthe parameters, the critical current (20) computed numerically is plotted in Fig. 2. Depending on the values of the\nparameters, it shows either an exponential decay or an exponential decay with oscillations, as a function of d.\nNote that in most experimental situations \u03beT \u226b \u03beh , because the ferromagnetic exchange energy exceeds by far the\nsuperconducting critical temperature.

In this\nregime, the damped oscillations of the critical current at large d are determined by the solutions to the equation\np\np\np\np\nz 2 + i coth(\u03b1 z 2 \u2212 i) + z 2 \u2212 i coth(\u03b1 z 2 + i) = 0\n(27)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith the smallest positive imaginary part.

The dependence of the critical current on d is then purely decaying,\nwithout 0\u2013\u03c0 oscillations (Fig. 2, dotted line).\nC.\n\n0\u2013\u03c0 phase diagram\n\nBetween the two regimes of small and large domains, there is a phase transition as a function of a/\u03beh corresponding\nto a bifurcation of the real solution z02 to Eq. (27) at smaller a to complex solutions at larger a. For a/\u03beh smaller than\nthe critical value, the critical current decays as a function of d without oscillations (always in the 0 phase). For a/\u03beh\nlarger than the critical value, the dependence on d is damped oscillatory, qualitatively similar to a single-domain SFS\njunction.\nNumerically, we find the critical value ac /\u03beh \u2248 0.83. The full 0\u2013\u03c0 phase diagram in the high-field limit is plotted in\nFig. 3. Periodic 0\u2013\u03c0 transitions (as a function of d) above ac /\u03beh and zero phase below ac /\u03beh illustrate our discussion.\nThe absence of the 0\u2013\u03c0 transitions in the case of small domains may explain why in some experimental SFS junctions\nthe \u03c0 state is absent.15,16\nFor completeness, in Fig. 4 we also plot the locus of solutions z02 to Eq. (27) in the complex plane for all values of\n(eff)\n\u03b1 (in the units \u0393sf /h and h(eff) /h). The corresponding real and imaginary parts of \u03bb determining the d dependence\nof the critical current (24) are plotted in the inset.\nIV.\n\nLOCAL CURRENT DENSITY\n\nSince the system does not have a translational symmetry along the y direction, the Josephson current forms a\nnontrivial pattern in the x-y plane. In Fig. 5 we present plots of the current density (proportional to sin \u03c6) at two\ndifferent points of the phase diagram: in the zero phase and in the \u03c0 phase.\nThose inhomogeneous patterns may be qualitatively understood on the basis of interpreting the domain walls as\nproducing an effective spin-flip scattering.

The effective spin-flip processes renormalize the\ndecay coefficient \u03bb in (24) and, therefore, different parts of the junction experience 0\u2013\u03c0 transitions at different values\nof d. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 6 depicting the current density near a 0\u2013\u03c0 transition. While the neighborhood\nof the domain wall is in the 0 phase, the region near the free boundaries (at y = \u00b1a) are in the \u03c0 phase. This\nsituation resembles a model studied by Buzdin et al.29 : a system of alternating zero and \u03c0 junctions. In that work, an\nintermediate equilibrium phase difference was predicted, depending on the ratio between the junction widths and the\nmagnetic coherence length. Even though our model cannot lead to such a \u03c6-junction (we consider linearized Usadel\nequations and therefore obtain a purely sinusoidal current-phase relation with only two possible equilibrium phases 0\nor \u03c0), at low temperatures such a SFS system with domains could possibly produce a \u03c6-state.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this work we consider a Josephson SFS junction consisting of domains with opposite magnetization connected\n\"in parallel\". As a function of the junction thickness, the critical current may exhibit either a decaying oscillating\nor a purely decaying behavior, depending on the domain width. The effect of domain walls in this geometry may\nbe approximated as an effective spin-flip scattering, together with a renormalization of the effective magnetic field.\nThis behavior is different from that in SFF'S junctions with the domains connected \"in series\" studied in Ref. 26. In\nthat SFF'S setup, the domain structure lead to a gradual reduction of the \u03c0 phase (at a non-parallel configuration\n\n\f9\nof the two domains), so that the relative fraction of the zero phase increases as a function of the mismatch in the\nmagnetization directions. In the present work, however, we do not consider the case of an arbitrary angle between\nthe two magnetizations, because of the complexity of the problem.\nWe expect that in a realistic geometry of domains both effects of the spin-flip scattering and of the reduction of\nthe \u03c0 phase take place simultaneously, and our findings from this work and from Ref. 26 may help to qualitatively\ndescribe the 0\u2013\u03c0 phase diagram of real SFS junctions with inhomogeneous ferromagnets.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Foundation.
