We report preliminary results for charmonium-nucleon potential Vcc\u0304N (r) from quenched\nlattice QCD, which is calculated from the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter amplitude through the effective\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. Our simulations are performed at a lattice cutoff of 1/a=2.0 GeV in a spatial\nvolume of (3 fm)3 with the nonperturbatively O(a) improved Wilson action for the light quarks and\na relativistic heavy quark action for the charm quark. We have found that the potential Vcc\u0304N (r) is\nweakly attractive at short distance and exponentially screened at long distance.\nKeywords: Lattice QCD, Hadron-hadron interaction\nPACS: 11.15.Ha, 12.38.-t 12.38.Gc\n\nThe heavy quarkonium state such as the charmonium (cc\u0304) state does not share the\nsame quark flavor with the nucleon (N). This suggests that the heavy quarkoniumnucleon interaction is mainly induced by the genuine QCD effect of multi-gluon exchange [1, 2]. As an analog of the van der Waals force, two-gluon exchange contribution\ngives a weakly attractive, but long-ranged interaction between the heavy quarkonium\nstate and the nucleon. However, the validity of the calculation based on the perturbative\ntheory is questionable for QCD where the nature of the strong coupling appears in the\nlong distance region.\nThe cc\u0304-N scattering at low energies has been studied from first principles of QCD.\nThe s-wave J/\u03c8-N scattering length is about 0.1 fm by using QCD sum rules [4] and\n0.71\u00b10.48 fm (0.70\u00b10.66 fm for \u03b7c -N) by lattice QCD [5], while it is estimated as large\nas 0.25 fm from the gluonic van der Waals interaction [1]. All studies suggest that the\ncc\u0304-N interaction is weakly attractive. This indicates that the possibility of the formation\nof charmonium bound to nuclei is enhanced. In 1991, Brodsky et al. had argued that the\ncc\u0304-nucleus (A) bound system may be realized for the mass number A \u2265 3 if the attraction\nbetween the charmonium and the nucleon is sufficiently strong [3]. Therefore, precise\ninformation on the cc\u0304-N potential Vcc\u0304N (r) is indispensable for exploring nuclear-bound\ncharmonium state like \u03b7c -3 He or J/\u03c8-3 He bound state in few body calculations [6].\nWe recall a recent great success of the N-N potential from lattice QCD [7]. In this new\napproach, the potential between hadrons can be calculated from the equal-time BetheSalpeter (BS) amplitude through the effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Thus, the direct\nmeasurement of the cc\u0304-N potential is now feasible by using lattice QCD. It should be\nvery important to give a firm theoretical prediction about nuclear-bound charmonium,\nwhich is possibly investigated by experiments at J-PARC and GSI.\nThe method utilized here to calculate the hadron-hadron potential in lattice QCD is\nbased on the same idea originally applied for the N-N potential [7, 8]. We first calculate\n\n\fthe equal-time BS amplitude of two local operators (hadrons h1 and h2 ) separated by\ngiven spatial distances r = |x \u2212 y| from the four-point correlator Gh1 -h2 (r,t4 ,t3 ;t2 ,t1 ) =\n\u0001\u2020\n\u2211x0 ,y0 hO h1 (x,t4 )O h2 (y,t3 ) O h1 (x0 ,t2 )O h2 (y0 ,t1 ) i, which becomes asymptotically proportional to \u03c6h1 -h2 (r)e\u2212E(t3 \u2212t1 ) for |t3 \u2212t1 | \u001d 1 with fixed t2 and t4 , but keeping |t4 \u2212t2 | \u001d\n1. Here \u03c6h1 -h2 (r) = h0|O h1 (x)O h2 (y)|h1 h2 ; Ei with the total energy E for the ground state\nof the two-particle h1 -h2 state corresponds to a part of the BS amplitude and are called\nas the BS wave function [9, 10]. After an appropriate projection with respect to discrete\nrotation of the cubic group, which is now \"rotational symmetry\" on the lattice, one can\nget the BS wave function projected in the s-wave. Once the BS wave function \u03c6h1 -h2 (r)\nand the total energy E are calculated in lattice simulations, the hadron-hadron potential\ncan be obtained by\n1 \u22072 \u03c6h1 -h2 (r)\nVh1 -h2 (r) = E +\n(1)\n2\u03bc \u03c6h1 -h2 (r)\nwhere \u03bc is the reduced mass of the h1 -h2 state and \u22072 is defined by the discrete Laplacian\nwith nearest-neighbor points. More details of this method can be found in Ref. [8].\nIn this study, we only consider the low energy \u03b7c -N interaction, which doesn't possess\nthe spin dependent part. We have performed quenched lattice QCD simulations on two\ndifferent lattice sizes, L3 \u00d7 T = 323 \u00d7 48 and 163 \u00d7 48, with the single plaquette gauge\naction at \u03b2 = 6/g2 = 6.0, which corresponds to a lattice cutoff of a\u22121 \u2248 2.1 GeV. Our\nmain results are obtained from the data taken on the larger lattice (La \u2248 3.0 fm). A\nsupplementary data with a smaller lattice size (La \u2248 1.5 fm) are used for a test of the\nfinite size effect. The number of statistics is O(600) for L = 32 and O(200) for L = 16,\nrespectively.\nWe use non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson fermions for the light quarks\n(q) and a relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action for the charm quark (Q) [12]. The\nRHQ action is a variant of the Fermilab approach [11], which can remove large discretization errors for heavy quarks. The hopping parameter is chosen to be \u03baq =\n0.1342, 0.1339, 0.1333, which correspond to M\u03c0 = 0.64, 0.73, 0.87 GeV, and \u03baQ =\n0.1019 which is reserved for the charm-quark mass (M\u03b7c = 2.92 GeV) [13]. Each hadron\nmass is obtained by fitting corresponding two-point correlation functions with a single\nexponential form. We calculate quark propagators with wall sources, which are located\nat tsrc = 5 for the light quarks and at tsrc = 4 for the charm quark, with the Coulomb\ngauge fixing. The ground state dominance in the four point function is checked by the\neffective mass plot of the total energy of the \u03b7c -N system.\nThe left panel of Fig.1 shows a typical result of the projected BS wave function at the\nsmallest quark mass, which is evaluated by a weighted average of data in the time-slice\nrange of 16 \u2264 t \u2212tsrc \u2264 35. The wave function is normalized to unity at a reference point\nr = (16, 16, 16), which is supposed to be outside of the interaction region. As shown in\nFig.1, the wave function is enhanced from unity near the origin so that the low-energy\n\u03b7c -N interaction is certainly attractive. This attractive interaction, however, is not enough\nstrong to form a bound state as is evident from this figure, where the wave function is\nnot localized, but extended at long distances.\nIn the right panel of Fig.1, we show the effective central \u03b7c -N potential, which is\nevaluated by the wave function through Eq. (1) with measured E and \u03bc.

The wave function (left) and the effective central potential (right) in the s-wave \u03b7c -N system\nfor m\u03c0 = 0.64 GeV as a typical example. In the right panel, the solid and dotted curves represent a fit result\nwith the Yukawa form and the phenomenological potential adopted in Ref. [3], respectively.\n\nthe \u03b7c -N potential clearly exhibits the entire attraction between the charmonium and the\nnucleon without any repulsion at either short or long distance. It also can be observed\nthat the interaction is exponentially screened in the long distance region r & 1 fm. This\nis consistent with what we expected for the color van der Waals force in QCD theory,\nwhere the strong confining nature of the color electric field must emerge [14, 15].\nIn detail, the long-range screening of the color van der Waals force is confirmed by\nthe following analysis. We have tried to fit data with two types of fitting functions: i)\nexponential type function as \u2212 exp(\u2212rm )/rn , which includes the Yukawa form (m = 1\nand n = 1), and ii) inverse power law function as \u22121/rn , where n and m are not restricted\nto be integers. The former case can easily accommodate a good fit with a small \u03c7 2 /ndf\nvalue, while in the latter case we cannot get any reasonable fit. For examples, functional\nforms \u2212 exp(\u2212r)/r and \u22121/r7 give \u03c7 2 /ndf ' 2.5 and 34.3 for fittings, respectively. It is\nclear that the long range force induced by a normal \"van der Waals\" type potential based\non two-gluon exchange [15] is non-perturbatively screened.\nIf we adopt the Yukawa form \u2212\u03b3e\u2212\u03b1r /r to fit our data of Vcc\u0304N (r), we obtain \u03b3 \u223c 0.1\nand \u03b1 \u223c 0.6 GeV. These values should be compared with the phenomenological cc\u0304-N\npotential adopted in Refs. [3], where parameters (\u03b3 = 0.6, \u03b1 = 0.6 GeV) are barely\nfixed by a Pomeron exchange model. The strength of the Yukawa potential \u03b3 is six\ntimes smaller than the phenomenological one, while the Yukawa screening parameter\n\u03b1 obtained from our data is comparable to the corresponding one. The observed cc\u0304-N\npotential from lattice QCD is rather weak.\nWe next show the finite size dependence and the quark-mass dependence of the \u03b7c -N\npotential in Fig. 2. Firstly, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, there is no significant\ndifference between potentials computed from lattices with two different spatial sizes\n(La \u2248 3.0 and 1.5 fm). This observation is simply because of the fact that the \u03b7c -N\npotential is quickly screened to zero and turns out to be somehow short ranged. In\nprinciple, the short range part of the potential, which is represented by the ultraviolet\nphysics, should be insensitive to the spatial extent associated with an infrared cutoff.\nAs a result, it is assured that the larger lattice size is large enough to study the \u03b7c -N\nsystem. The appreciable quark-mass dependence is also not observed in the right panel\n\n\f10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-10\nV(r) [MeV]\n\nV(r) [MeV]\n\n10\n\n-20\n-30\n-40\n\n-30\n-40\n\n-50\n-60\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nr [fm]\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nm\u03c0=640 MeV\nm\u03c0=730 MeV\nm\u03c0=870 MeV\n\n-50\n\nm\u03c0=640 MeV L33xT=3233x48\nm\u03c0=640 MeV L xT=16 x48\n1.4\n\n-60\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\nr [fm]\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nFIGURE 2. The volume dependence (left) and the quark-mass dependence (right) on the \u03b7c -N potential.\n\nof Fig. 2. This is expected from the fact that the cc\u0304-N interaction is mainly governed by\nmulti-gluon exchange. However, it is worth mentioning that the ordinary van der Waals\ninteraction is sensitive to the size of the charge distribution. Indeed, it is reminded that\nour simulations are performed in quenched approximation and at rather heavy quark\nmasses. This suggests that the cc\u0304-N potential from the dynamical simulations would\nbecome more strongly attractive in the vicinity of the physical point, where the size of\nthe nucleon is much larger than at the simulated quark mass in this study.\nWe have studied the cc\u0304-N potential Vcc\u0304N (r) from quenched lattice QCD, which is\ncalculated from the equal-time BS amplitude through the effective Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nIt is found that potential Vcc\u0304N (r) is weakly attractive at short distance and exponentially\nscreened at long distance. In order to make a reliable prediction about nuclear-bound\ncharmonium, an important step in the future is clearly an extension to dynamical lattice\nQCD simulation. Such planning is now underway.\nS.S. is supported by JSPS Grants (No. 19540265 and No. 21105504).
