This extremely rare event exhibits a striking\nsimilarity to the two giant outbursts thus far observed, on 1979 March 5 from\nSGR 0526-66 (ref. 7) and 1998 August 27 from SGR 1900+14 (ref. 8,9,10). All\nthe three outbursts start with a short giant radiation pulse followed by a weaker\ntail. The tail pulsates with the period of neutron star rotation of \u223c5\u20138 s, to\ndecay finally in a few minutes. The enormous intensity of the initial pulse proved\nto be far above the saturation level of the gamma-ray detectors, with the result\nthat the most valuable data on the time structure and energy spectrum of the\npulse is lost. At the time of the December 27 outburst, a Russian spacecraft\nCoronas-F with a \u03b3-ray spectrometer aboard was occulted by the Earth and\ncould not see the outburst. It succeeded, however, in observing a weak reflected\nsignal due to the \u03b3-rays Compton scattered by the Moon (ref. 11). This has\nbeen the first observation of a cosmic gamma-ray flare reflected from a celestial\nbody. Here we report, that the detection of a weakened back-scattered initial\npulse combined with direct observations by the Konus \u03b3-ray spectrometer on the\nWind spacecraft permitted us to reliably reconstruct the intensity, time history,\nand energy spectra of the outburst.\n\n1\n\nIoffe Physico-Technical Institute, St Petersburg 194021, Russia\n\n2\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 661, Greenbelt, MD 20771\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nDuring the period elapsed since its launch in 1994, Konus-Wind has detected three\ngiant outbursts. The first of them came on 1998 June 18 from SGR 1627-41 (ref. 12). It\nwas weaker than the others and did not have a pulsating tail. The second giant outburst,\non 1998 August 27 (ref. 8,9,10), was associated with SGR 1900+14. It is to this event that\nthe giant outburst on 2004 December 27 from SGR 1806-20 is very similar.\nOn Wind, the record of this outburst was triggered by a preceding recurrent soft burst\nat T0 =21:27:58.447 s UT. This burst was the last but strongest of a series of 10 recurrent\nbursts which occurred on December 27 before the giant outburst. The strongly enhanced\nSGR recurrent activity at the end of 2004 could be an indication of an approaching giant\noutburst, as was the case with the 1998 August 27 event (ref. 13). Figure 1 presents a\nfragment of the time history of the giant outburst recorded with a 0.256-s resolution. The\nevent started at T \u2212 T0 =142.08 s with an extremely steep intensity rise to drive the gamma\ndetector far above the saturation level for \u223c0.5 s. On termination of the initial pulse and\nwith the detector having resumed operation, the burst tail became visible until its decay\nafter \u223c380 s. The burst tail intensity pulsates with the period of neutron star rotation\nP = 7.57 \u00b1 0.07 s. Each period exhibits a complex, three-peaked pulsation structure. The\ncount rate ratio of the G2 (65\u2013280 keV) to G1 (16.5\u201365 keV) energy windows is a measure of\nthe spectral hardness of the radiation. Within each period, the spectral hardness correlates\nwith the intensity structure. Most likely the variations in the intensity and spectral shape\nduring a period are caused by changing of the viewing angle on a rotating anisotropic source.\nFigure 2 displays an energy spectrum of the tail averaged over the pulsation period. The\nspectrum consists of two components, with the energy region of up to \u2243400 keV being\ndominated by a component falling off exponentially with energy, and at energies > 400 keV\nby a power law with a photon index of \u22121.8 \u00b1 0.2. Such spectra vary very little in shape as\nthe burst decays. Each of them contains a weak hard power-law component extending to as\nfar as 10 MeV. The total fluence in the outburst tail can be estimated as 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 erg cm\u22122\nin the 20 keV\u201310 MeV band. Estimation of the initial pulse fluence from complete detector\nsaturation during \u22480.5 s can yield only its lower limit > 10\u22122 erg cm\u22122 . Thus, direct\nobservation of an outburst does not permit one to obtain data on the intensity, time history,\nand energy spectrum of the initial pulse.\nA fortunate chance to gain this information has been provided by observation by the\nHelicon instrument on Coronas-F of a short gamma-ray burst on 2004 December 27 at\n21:30:29.303 s UT. Figure 3 presents a time history of this burst recorded in the energy\nwindows G1 (25\u2013100 keV) and G2 (100\u2013450 keV), and the G2/G1 ratio which exhibits\na strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution. Shown in Fig. 4 is an average energy spectrum\naccumulated over 128 ms after T0 . There are two grounds arguing for this burst to result\nfrom Compton scattering of the giant pulse by the Moon. First, it is consistent with the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndelay of its arrival to Coronas-F and Wind to be expected in this case (a schematic diagram\nof the flare wavefront propagation is shown on Fig. 5). Second, while the shape of the\nmeasured energy spectrum is far from typical of gamma-ray bursts, it fits quite well the\nso-called Compton backscattering peak at scattering angles of about 180\u25e6 , where the energy\nof singly scattered photons cannot exceed \u223c mc2 /2. The real angle through which the\nradiation incident on the Coronas-F detector was scattered lies in the range 159.5\u2013159.9\u25e6.\nThe right-hand wing of the observed spectrum derives primarily from scattering, multiple\nas well as single, of photons with energies in excess of \u223c200 keV striking the Moon. In\nthis energy region, the cross section of photoabsorption is substantially lower than that of\nCompton scattering. The left-hand wing covers a low energy region where photoabsorption\nbecomes strongly dominating over scattering, so that an ever decreasing fraction of photons\nis capable of escaping out of the lunar soil.\nTo determine the spectrum and intensity of the initial pulse, the burst radiation scattering from the Moon was numerically simulated by the Monte Carlo method using the\nwell-known GEANT code developed in CERN (ref. 14). A response matrix of the Moon for\nthe above-mentioned scattering angles was calculated for a broad photon energy range from\n20 keV to 12 MeV and folded then with the detector response matrix. The result of the\nspectrum simulation is also shown in Fig. 4. The best-fit model was found to be a power\nlaw function with an exponential cutoff, dN/dE = A (E/100)\u03b1 exp(\u2212E/E0 ) with \u03b1=-0.7\nand E0 =800 keV. The reflected energy flux seen by Coronas-F is weak being attenuated\nby a factor of \u2248 10\u22126 . The energy spectrum statistics is poor, particularly in the wings.\nTherefore, the confidence regions of 68 and 90% for the \u03b1 and E0 parameters shown in Fig. 6\nare fairly large. One readily sees, however, that the fitting parameters \u03b1 and E0 are in\nstrong anticorrelation. As a result, the estimates of the total energy in the pulse vary rather\nweakly. At a confidence level of 90% the fluence and the peak flux of the initial pulse in the\n\u22122\n\u22122 \u22121\n20 keV\u201310 MeV energy band are 0.61+0.35\nand 9.2+5.6\ns .\n\u22120.17 erg cm\n\u22123.1 erg cm\nPhotons scattered from different zones of a spherical target reach an observer with a\nrelative time delay whose maximum value is 2RM /c = 11.6 ms, where RM is the Moon's\nradius, and c is the velocity of light. This gives rise to a blurred time profile of the reflected\nsignal (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, the real front of the initial pulse should be shorter than\nobserved, \u224810\u201315 ms. Figure 7 displays a reconstructed time profile of the initial pulse. By\nWind's information, the giant outburst starts with a comparatively slow intensity rise, which\ntransforms in \u223c20 ms to an avalanche-type growth. The continuation of the time history was\nderived from Coronas-F data by introducing the corresponding corrections for attenuation\nand spreading of the signal as it is scattered and propagates to Coronas-F. As evident from\nthe figure, the intensity reaches a peak of \u223c 107 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . At Helicon sensitivity,\nthe initial pulse is detected over a background for \u223c150 ms. A saturation of the Konus lasts\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nlonger, about 600 ms.\nAssuming isotropic emission and a distance to SGR 1806-20 of 15 kpc (ref. 15), the\nenergy release and the maximal luminosity of the initial pulse are 1.6 \u00d7 1046 erg and 2.5 \u00d7\n1047 erg s\u22121 . The energy release in the tail of all the three giant outbursts in the SGRs is\n\u223c 1044 erg, and one may expect the energy confined in their initial pulses to be comparable,\nabout \u223c 1045 \u22121046 erg. This is consistent with our earlier assumption that the lower limit on\nthe energy released in the initial pulse of the giant outbursts from SGR 1900+14 is actually\nmany times smaller than its true value (ref. 9), because the referred value of > 7 \u00d7 1043 erg\nwas calculated for a minimum flux which is capable of saturating the Konus. The energy\nrelease of 1046 erg is comparable to the energy stored in the magnetosphere of a neutron\nstar with a surface magnetic dipole field of \u223c 1014 G. This may present serious difficulties\nfor the magnetar model of SGRs (ref. 16). Giant outbursts from SGRs at larger distances\nshould be observed as short (\u223c0.25 s) gamma-ray bursts with a hard spectrum (ref. 17).\nIt is conceivable that it is such events that make up part of the Konus-Wind catalog of\nshort gamma-ray bursts (ref. 18). Present-day gamma-ray spectrometers, which can reliably\nmeasure the time profile and energy spectrum of short gamma-ray bursts with fluences of\n\u223c 10\u22127 erg cm\u22122 , should be capable of recording the initial pulses of giant outbursts from\nSGRs at distances of \u223c30 Mpc. If such a burst is localized to within \u223c5\u201310 arc minutes, its\nidentification with a host galaxy may become possible.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Borkowski, J. et al. 2004, GCN Circ. 2920\n2.

Compared to the true profile of the initial pulse I(t), it is spread, and the rise\nis less steep because of the signal being delayed in reflection from different regions on the\nspherical Moon.
