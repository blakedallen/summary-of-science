GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\nAbstract. We consider a new class of linear codes, called affine Grassmann\ncodes. These can be viewed as a variant of generalized Reed-Muller codes and\nare closely related to Grassmann codes. We determine the length, dimension,\nand the minimum distance of any affine Grassmann code. Moreover, we show\nthat affine Grassmann codes have a large automorphism group and determine\nthe number of minimum weight codewords.\n\n1. Introduction\nReed-Muller codes are among the most widely studied classes of linear error correcting codes. Numerous generalizations and variants of Reed-Muller codes have\nalso been considered in the literature. (See, for example, [2], [12, Ch. 13\u201315], [14,\nCh. 1, \u00a713; Ch. 11, \u00a73.4.1; Ch. 16, \u00a73; Ch. 17, \u00a74] and the relevant references\ntherein). In this paper we introduce a class of linear codes that appears to be a\ngenuinely distinct variant of Reed-Muller codes. As explained in Section 7, this\nnew class of codes is intimately related to the so-called Grassmann codes, which\nhave been of much current interest (see, for example, [6, 7, 9, 13] and the relevant\nreferences therein), and with this in view we call these the affine Grassmann codes.\nRoughly speaking, affine Grassmann codes are obtained by evaluating linear polynomials in the minors of a generic l \u00d7 l\u2032 matrix at all points of the corresponding\naffine space over a finite field. Evidently, when l = 1, this gives the first order\ngeneralized Reed-Muller code RM(1, l\u2032 ). However, in general, the resulting code\nis distinct from higher order generalized Reed-Muller codes and determination of\nseveral of its properties appears to be rather nontrivial. Our main results include\nthe determination of the minimal distance (Theorem 16) and a characterization as\nwell as an explicit enumeration of the minimum weight codewords (Theorems 28\nand 32). Further, we show that affine Grassmann codes have a large automorphism\ngroup (Theorem 21); this result could be viewed as an extension of the work of\nDelsarte, Goethals and MacWilliams [2, Thm. 2.3.1], Kn\u00f6rr and Willems [11] as\nwell as Berger and Charpin [1] on the automorphisms of Reed-Muller codes. In\ngeometric terms, some of our results could be viewed as a generalization of elementary facts about hyperplanes over finite fields to \"determinantal hyperplanes\".\n(See Remark 11 for greater details.) The auxiliary results obtained in the course\nof proving the main theorems and the techniques employed may also be of some\nindependent interest.\n2. Preliminaries\nDenote, as usual, by Fq the finite field with q elements. Fix positive integers l\nand l\u2032 and a l \u00d7 l\u2032 matrix X = (Xij ) whose entries are algebraically independent\nindeterminates over Fq . By Fq [X] we denote the polynomial ring in the ll\u2032 indeterminates Xij (1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 ) with coefficients in Fq . For convenience, we\nDate: October 8, 2009; Revised: June 10, 2010. To appear in the IEEE Transactions of\nInformation Theory, Vol. 56, No. 7 (July 2010).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nintroduce the following notation for the rows and columns of the matrix X:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX1j\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nXi = (Xi1 * * * Xil\u2032 ) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l and Xj = \uf8ed ... \uf8f8 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 .\nXlj\n\nRecall that by a minor of X of order i we mean the determinant of an i\u00d7i submatrix\nof X. A minor of X of order i is sometimes referred to as an i \u00d7 i minor of X. But\nin any case, it should be remembered that the minors of X are not matrices, but\nare elements of the polynomial ring Fq [X].\nWe are primarily interested in the linear space generated by all the minors of\nX. This is unchanged if we replace X by its transpose. With this in view, we shall\nalways assume that l \u2264 l\u2032 . Further, we set\nm = l + l\u2032\n\nand \u03b4 = ll\u2032 .\n\nFor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 l, we let \u2206i (l, m) be the set of all i \u00d7 i minors of X, where, as per\nstandard conventions, the only 0 \u00d7 0 minor of X is 1. We define\n\u2206(l, m) =\n\nl\n[\n\n\u2206i (l, m).\n\ni=0\n\nDefinition 1. The linear space F (l, m) over Fq is the subspace of Fq [X] generated\nby \u2206(l, m).\nFor example, if l = l\u2032 = 2, then m = 4, \u03b4 = 4, and \u22060 (2, 4) = {1}, while\n\u22061 (2, 4) = {X11 , X12 , X21 , X22 } and \u22062 (2, 4) = {X11 X22 \u2212 X12 X21 }.\nThus a typical element of F (2, 4) looks like\n(1)\n\na + b1 X11 + b2 X12 + b3 X21 + b4 X22 + c (X11 X22 \u2212 X12 X21 )\n\nwhere a, b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , c \u2208 Fq . Observe that #\u2206(2, 4) = 6, where for a finite set D,\nwe denote by #D the cardinality of D. In general, we have the following.\n\u0001\nLemma 2. The cardinality of \u2206(l, m) is m\nl .\n\nProof. Since the entries of X are indeterminates, the number of minors of X of\norder i is the number of i \u00d7 i submatrices of X. An i \u00d7 i submatrix of X is obtained\nby choosing i rows among the l rows and i columns among the l\u2032 columns. Thus\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\nl l\n#\u2206i (l, m) =\nfor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 l.\ni\ni\nConsequently,\nX \u0012 l \u0013\u0012l\u2032 \u0013 \u0012m\u0013\n#\u2206(l, m) =\n=\n,\nl\u2212i\ni\nl\ni\u22650\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the so-called Chu\u2013Vandermonde summation\n(see e.g. [8, Sec. 5.1, (5.27)]).\n\u0003\nWe remark that an alternative proof of the above lemma can be obtained by\nobserving that the minors of X (of arbitrary orders) are in a natural one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the l\u00d7l minors of the l\u00d7m matrix (X|I) obtained by adjoining\nto X a l \u00d7 l identity matrix.\nThe following basic result can be viewed as a very special case of the standard\nbasis theorem or the straightening law of Doubilet, Rota and Stein (cf. [3], [5, Thm.\n4.2]). In the case we are interested in, a much simpler proof can be given and this\nis included below.\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n3\n\nLemma 3. The elements of \u2206(l, m) are linearly independent. In particular,\n\u0012 \u0013\nm\ndimFq F (l, m) =\n.\nl\nP\nProof. Suppose there is a linear dependence relation M\u2208\u2206(l,m) aM M = 0, where\naM \u2208 Fq for M \u2208 \u2206(l, m). We will show by finite induction on i (0 \u2264 i \u2264 l)\nthat aM = 0 for all M \u2208 \u2206i (l, m). First, by specializing all the variables to zero\n(i.e., by substituting Xrs = 0 for all r \u2208 {1, . . . , l} and s \u2208 {1. . . . , l\u2032 } in the linear\ndependence relation), we see that the desired assertion holds when i = 0. Next,\nsuppose i > 0 and aM = 0 for all M \u2208 \u2206j (l, m) and all j < i. Pick a minor\nM \u2208 \u2206i (l, m). By specializing all the variables except the ones occurring in M\nto zero, we obtain aM = 0. Repeating this procedure for each i \u00d7 i minor, we\nobtain the induction step. This proves that the elements of\u0001 \u2206(l, m) are linearly\nindependent. Consequently, dimFq F (l, m) = #\u2206(l, m) = m\n\u0003\nl .\n\nThanks to Lemma 3, every element of F (l, m) is a unique Fq -linear combination\nof the elements of \u2206(l, m). With this in view, we make the following definition.\nP\nDefinition 4. Given f = M\u2208\u2206(l,m) aM M \u2208 F (l, m), where aM \u2208 Fq for every\nM \u2208 \u2206(l, m), the support of f is the set\nsupp(f ) := {M \u2208 \u2206(l, m) : aM 6= 0}.\nNote that the the support of f is the empty set if and only if f is the zero polynomial.\n\nWe shall denote the space of all l \u00d7 l\u2032 matrices with entries in Fq by A\u03b4 (Fq ), or\nsimply by A\u03b4 . Indeed, for fixed positive integers l and l\u2032 , this space can be readily\nidentified with the \u03b4-dimensional affine space over Fq , where \u03b4 = ll\u2032 , as before. It is\nclear that for any f \u2208 Fq [X] (and in particular, any f \u2208 F (l, m)) and P \u2208 A\u03b4 , the\nelement f (P ) of Fq is well-defined. Now let us fix an enumeration P1 , P2 , . . . , Pq\u03b4\nof A\u03b4 .\nDefinition 5. The evaluation map of Fq [X] is the map\nEv : Fq [X] \u2192 Fqq\n\n\u03b4\n\ndefined by\n\n\u0001\nEv(f ) := f (P1 ), . . . , f (Pq\u03b4 ) .\n\nIt is clear that the evaluation map Ev defined above is a surjective linear map.\nAlso,\nof Ev is the ideal of Fq [X] generated by\n\b q it is well-known that the kernel\nXij \u2212 Xij : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 , and that this kernel contains no nonzero polynomial having degree < q in each of the variables. (See, for example, [10, p. 11].)\nIn particular, if 0 6= f \u2208 F (l, m), then f cannot be in the kernel of Ev because\ndegXij (f ) \u2264 1 for each variable Xij . Thus the restriction of the evaluation map Ev\nto F (l, m) is injective. We are now ready to define the codes that are studied in\nthe remainder of this paper.\nDefinition 6. The affine Grassmann code C A (l, m) is the image of F (l, m) under\nthe evaluation map Ev. The minimum distance of C A (l, m) := Ev (F (l, m)) will be\ndenoted by d(l, m).\nRecall that a code C is said to be degenerate if there exists a coordinate position\ni such that ci = 0 for all c \u2208 C. It turns out that affine Grassmann codes are\nnondegenerate and their length and dimension are easily determined.\nLemma 7. The affine Grassmann\ncode C A (l, m) is a nondegenerate linear code of\n\u0001\nm\n\u03b4\nlength q and dimension l .\n\n\f4\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nProof. It is obvious that C A (l, m) is a linear code of length q \u03b4 = #A\u03b4 (Fq ). Moreover, since the constant polynomial 1, being the only element of \u22060 (l, m), is in\nF (l, m), and since Ev(1) = (1, . . . , 1), it follows that C A (l, m) is nondegenerate.\nFinally, since the evaluation map is injective\non F (l, m), it follows from Lemma 3\n\u0001\nthat the dimension of C A (l, m) is m\n.\n\u0003\nl\n\nExample 8. Suppose l = l\u2032 = 2. Then m = \u03b4 = 4 and the elements of F (2, 4) are\nof the form (1). The affine space A\u03b4 consists of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices with entries in\nF2 = {0, 1}. There are 16 such matrices and, upon letting eij denote the 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix with 1 in (i, j)th position and 0 elsewhere, A\u03b4 (F2 ) may be enumerated as\n0, e11 , e12 , e21 , e22 , e11 + e12 , e11 + e21 , e11 + e22 , e12 + e21 , e12 + e22 , e21 +\ne22 , e11 + e12 + e21 , e11 + e12 + e22 , e11 + e21 + e22 , e12 + e21 + e22 , e11 + e12 +\ne21 + e22 , where 0 denotes the 2 \u00d7 2 zero matrix. Accordingly, the codewords of\nC A (2, 4) consist of the elements of F16\n2 of the form a1 + v, where 1 denotes the\n16-tuple all of whose coordinates are 1, whereas v denotes the 16-tuple given by\n(0, b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , b1 + b2 , b1 + b3 , b1 + b4 + c, b2 + b3 + c, b2 + b4 , b3 + b4 , b1 +\nb2 + b3 + c, b1 + b2 + b4 + c, b1 + b3 + b4 + c, b2 + b3 + b4 + c, b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 + c).\nHere a, b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , c vary over F2 . As such, there are 26 = 64 codewords, and it\nis clear that the code is nondegenerate and its dimension is 6; indeed, a F2 -basis\nof C A (2, 4) is obtained by setting exactly one of a, b1 , b2 , b3 , b4 , c to be 1 and the\nothers to be 0. Further, by listing the 64 codewords, it is easily seen that every\nnonzero codeword is of (Hamming) weight \u2265 6, and the codeword corresponding\na = b1 = b2 = b3 = b4 = 0 and c = 1 is of weight 6. Thus, at least in the binary\ncase, C A (2, 4) is a [16, 6, 6]-code.\nWe end this section by giving two lemmas on determinants that will be useful in\nthe sequel.\nLemma 9. Let Y = (Yij ) be a l \u00d7 l matrix whose entries are independent indeterminates over Fq and let B = (bij ) be a l \u00d7 l matrix with entries in Fq . Then there\nis h \u2208 F (l, 2l) such that\ndet(Y +B) = det(Y )+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+j bij det(Y ij )+h\n\nwith\n\nsupp(h) \u2286\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264l\n\nl\u22122\n[\n\n\u2206i (l, 2l),\n\ni=0\n\nwhere Y ij denotes the (l \u2212 1) \u00d7 (l \u2212 1) matrix obtained from Y by deleting the i-th\nrow and the j-th column.\nProof. For a subset S of {1, . . . , l}, denote by (Y, B)S the matrix obtained from Y\nby replacing for all j \u2208 S, the j-th column of Y by the j-th column of B. By the\nmultilinearity of the determinant, we readily see that\nX\ndet(Y + B) =\ndet((Y, B)S ),\nS\n\nwhere the sum is over all subsets S of {1, . . . , l}. Observe that if S is the empty\nset, then det((Y, B)S ) = det(Y ). Moreover, if S is singleton, say S = {j}, where\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 l, then by developing the determinant along the j-th column we find that\ndet((Y, B)S ) =\n\nl\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+j bij det(Y ij ).\n\ni=1\n\nFinally, if S \u2286 {1, . . . , l} with #S = s \u2265 2, then using Laplace expansion along\nthe columns indexed by the elements of S, we see that det((Y, B)S ) is a Fq -linear\ncombination of minors in \u2206l\u2212s (l, 2l). This yields the desired result.\n\u0003\nWe will also need the following well-known result whose proof can be found, for\nexample, in [4, Ch. I, \u00a72].\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n5\n\nLemma 10 (Cauchy-Binet). Let r and s be positive integers such that r \u2264 s, and\nlet A be a r \u00d7 s matrix and B a s \u00d7 r matrix with entries in a commutative ring.\nFor a subset I of {1, . . . , s} with #I = r, denote by AI the r \u00d7 r submatrix of A\nformed by the j-th columns of A for j \u2208 I, and denote by BI the r \u00d7 r submatrix\nof B formed by the i-th rows of B for i \u2208 I. Then\nX\ndet(AB) =\ndet(AI ) det(BI ),\nI\n\nwhere the sum is over all subsets I of {1, . . . , s} of cardinality r.\n\nRemark 11. As a warm-up for the results of the subsequent section, let us consider\nthe case of l = 1 even though it is rather trivial. Here F (1, m) corresponds to the\nspace of linear polynomials in l\u2032 variables of the form h = a0 + a1 X11 + * * *+ al\u2032 X1l\u2032 .\nFor any such h, the Hamming weight of the corresponding codeword Ev(h) amounts\n\u2032\nto finding the the number of Fq -rational points on a hyperplane in Al . Indeed,\nassuming that Ev(h) is nonzero, or equivalently that not all a0 , a1 , . . . , al\u2032 are zero,\nit is readily seen that\n( \u2032\nql\nif a1 = * * * = al\u2032 = 0,\nl\u2032\nwH (Ev(h)) = #A (Fq ) \u2212 #H =\nl\u2032\nl\u2032 \u22121\nq \u2212q\notherwise,\n\u2032\n\nwhere H denotes the affine hyperplane {P \u2208 Al (Fq ) : h(P ) = 0}. It follows that the\n\u2032\nminimum distance of C A (1, m) is q l \u22121 (q\u22121), and also that the number of minimum\n\u2032\nweight codewords is (q l +1 \u2212 q). In a similar manner, the general case corresponds\nto finding the maximum number of points on a \"determinantal hyperplane\", i.e.,\nthe zero-set of an arbitrary nonzero element of F (l, m), and finding the minimum\nweight codewords corresponds to finding those determinantal hyperplanes where\nthe maximum is attained.\n3. Minimum distance\nIn this section we will compute the minimum distance d(l, m) of the affine Grassmann code C A (l, m). We start by determining the Hamming weight of a maximal\nminor, obtaining thereby an upper bound for d(l, m). As usual we denote by wH (c)\nthe Hamming weight of a codeword c.\nLemma 12. Let M \u2208 \u2206l (l, m). Then\nwH (Ev(M)) = q \u03b4\u2212l\n\n2\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nIn particular,\nd(l, m) \u2264 q \u03b4\u2212l\n\n2\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nProof. Without loss of generality we shall assume that M is the leading maximal\nminor, i.e., M = det((Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l ). Let P \u2208 A\u03b4 (Fq ) and let (pij )1\u2264i\u2264l, 1\u2264j\u2264l\u2032 be\nthe l \u00d7 l\u2032 matrix with entries in Fq corresponding to P . It is clear that M(P ) 6= 0 if\nand only if the l \u00d7 l submatrix (pij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l is nonsingular. This happens for exactly\nQl\u22121 l\ni\n\u2032\n2\ni=0 (q \u2212 q ) values of pij with 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l. The remaining ll \u2212 l values pij\nwith j > l do not play any role in the evaluation of M at P . Hence wH (Ev(M)) =\n2 Ql\u22121\n\u0003\nq (\u03b4\u2212l ) i=0 (q l \u2212 q i ). This implies the desired inequality for d(l, m).\n\nWe will show that the upper bound for d(l, m) in the above lemma gives, in fact,\nthe true minimum distance. To this end, the specialization maps defined below will\nbe useful.\n\n\f6\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nDefinition 13. Let i, j be integers satisfying 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 , and let\n\u2032\na = (a1 , . . . , al\u2032 ) \u2208 Flq and b = (b1 , . . . , bl ) \u2208 Flq . The row-wise specialization map\nrelative to a and i is the map\ns(i)\na : F (l, m) \u2192 F (l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1)\n\ndefined by\n\ns(i)\na (f ) := f |Xi =a ,\n\n(i)\n\ni.e., sa (f ) is the element of F (l\u22121, m\u22121) obtained by substituting (Xi1 , . . . , Xil\u2032 ) =\n(a1 , . . . , al\u2032 ) in f (X11 , . . . , Xll\u2032 ). Further, if l\u2032 > l, then the column-wise specialization map relative to b and j is the map\n(j)\n\ntb : F (l, m) \u2192 F (l, m \u2212 1)\n\ndefined by\n\n(j)\n\ntb (f ) := f |Xj =b ,\n\n(j)\n\ni.e., tb (f ) is the element of F (l, m \u2212 1) obtained by substituting (X1j , . . . , Xlj ) =\n(i)\n(j)\n(b1 , . . . , bl ) in f . It may be noted that sa and tb are Fq -linear maps.\nLemma 14. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i, j be integers satisfying 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l and\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 . Then\nX\n\u0001\nwH Ev(s(i)\n(2)\nwH (Ev(f )) =\na (f )) .\na\u2208Flq\u2032\n\nMoreover, if l\u2032 > l, then\n(3)\n\nwH (Ev(f )) =\n\nX\n\nb\u2208Flq\n\n\u0001\n(j)\nwH Ev(tb (f )) .\n(i)\n\n\u2032\n\nProof. Given any a \u2208 Flq , the specialization sa (f ) is in F (l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1) and\n(i)\n\n\u2032\n\nhence the codeword Ev(sa (f )) has q \u03b4\u2212l coordinates; each of these coordinates\ncan be computed by evaluating f at those points P = (pij ) of A\u03b4 (Fq ) satisfying\n\u2032\n(pi1 , . . . , pil\u2032 ) = a. As a varies over Flq , all the q \u03b4 coordinates of Ev(f ) will be\naccounted for. Thus the codeword Ev(f ) can be partitioned into shorter codewords\n\u2032\n(i)\nEv(sa (f )), a \u2208 Flq . This implies (2). The proof of (3) is similar.\n\u0003\nWe shall now consider the special case l = l\u2032 , i.e., m = 2l. In this case, X has a\nunique maximal minor and whenever it occurs in a polynomial in F (l, 2l), all the\nsubmaximal minors occurring in that polynomial can be killed by a translation.\nLemma 15. Let f \u2208 F (l, 2l) be such that det(X) \u2208 supp(f ) and the coefficient of\ndet(X) in f equals 1. Then there exists a unique l \u00d7 l matrix A with entries in Fq\nsuch that\nl\u22122\n[\n\u2206i (l, 2l).\nf = det(X + A) + h, where h \u2208 F (l, 2l) with supp(h) \u2286\ni=0\n\nProof. If l = 1, then the desired result holds trivially with h = 0. Assume that\nl \u2265 2. For 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l, let X ij denote the (l \u2212 1) \u00d7 (l \u2212 1) submatrix of X obtained\nby deleting the i-th row and the j-th column, and let bij denote the coefficient of\ndet(X ij ) in f . Then there is h1 \u2208 F (l, 2l) such that\nf = det(X) +\n\nX\n\nbij det(X ij ) + h1\n\nand supp(h1 ) \u2286\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264l\n\nl\u22122\n[\n\n\u2206i (l, 2l).\n\ni=0\n\nNow define aij = (\u22121)i+j bij for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l and let A denote the l \u00d7 l matrix\n(aij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l . By Lemma 9, there is h2 \u2208 F (l, 2l) such that\ndet(X + A) = det(X) +\n\nX\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264l\n\nbij X ij + h2\n\nand\n\nsupp(h2 ) \u2286\n\nl\u22122\n[\n\n\u2206i (l, 2l).\n\ni=0\n\nThus f = det(X + A) + h, where h := h1 \u2212 h2 , and we have the desired result. \u0003\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n7\n\nWe are now ready to prove the main result of this section.\nTheorem 16. The minimum distance d(l, m) of the code C A (l, m) is given by\n\n(4)\n\nd(l, m) = q \u03b4\u2212l\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n2\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nProof. We prove the theorem by induction on m. Note that m \u2265 2 since 1 \u2264 l \u2264 l\u2032 .\nIf m = 2, then l = l\u2032 = 1 and \u03b4 = 1, and so (4) follows from the observations in\nRemark 11 in this case. Now suppose m > 2 and the theorem is true for all codes\nC A (l, m\u2212 1), with 1 \u2264 l \u2264 \u230a(m\u2212 1)/2\u230b. We will prove (4) by considering separately\nthe cases l < l\u2032 and l = l\u2032 .\nCase 1: l < l\u2032 . Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and suppose f 6= 0. Then supp(f ) is nonempty.\nChoose a minor M \u2208 supp(f ) of the maximum possible order, say r, in the sense\nthat M \u2208 \u2206r (l, m) and \u2206s (l, m) \u2229 supp(f ) = \u2205 for all s > r. Since r \u2264 l < l\u2032 ,\nthere exists a column Xj of X such that the variables X1j , . . . , Xlj do not occur\n(j)\nin M. In particular, tb (M) = M for any b \u2208 Flq . Since M is of maximum order\n(j)\n\nin supp(f ), this implies that tb (f ) is not the zero polynomial and therefore the\n(j)\ncodeword Ev(tb (f )) is nonzero for any b \u2208 Flq . Consequently, by Lemma 14 and\nthe induction hypothesis, we see that\n\nwH (Ev(f ))\n\n=\n\n(j)\n\nX\n\nwH (Ev(tb (f )))\n\nb\u2208Flq\n\n\u2265\n\nq l d(l, m \u2212 1)\n\n=\n\nq l q (l \u22121)l\u2212l\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i )\n\ni=0\n\n=\n\nq \u03b4\u2212l\n\n2\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nSince the above holds for any nonzero f \u2208 F (l, m), we obtain\n\nd(l, m) \u2265 q \u03b4\u2212l\n\n2\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nThis inequality together with Lemma 12 establishes the induction step.\nCase 2: l = l\u2032 . In this case m = 2l and X has only one l \u00d7 l minor, namely\nL := det(X). Let f \u2208 F (l, 2l) be a nonzero polynomial. We will distinguish two\nsubcases depending on whether or not the l \u00d7 l minor L occurs in f .\nSubcase 1: L 6\u2208 supp(f ). In this event, by a similar reasoning as in Case 1, there\n(i)\nexists a row, say the i-th row, such that sa (f ) 6= 0 for all a \u2208 Flq . Consequently,\n\n\f8\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nby Lemma 14 and the induction hypothesis, we see that\nX\nwH (Ev(f )) =\nwH (Ev(s(i)\na (f )))\na\u2208Flq\n\n\u2265\n\nq l d(2l \u2212 1, l \u2212 1)\n\n=\n\nq l q (l\u22121)l\u2212(l\u22121)\n\n2\n\nl\u22122\nY\n\n(q l\u22121 \u2212 q i )\n\ni=0\n\n=\n\nql\n\nl\u22122\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i+1 )\n\ni=0\n\n>\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nThus from Lemma 12, we conclude that Ev(f ) cannot be a minimum weight codeword of C A (l, m) if det(X) 6\u2208 supp(f ).\nSubcase 2: L \u2208 supp(f ). In this event, by Lemma 15 there exists a l \u00d7 l\nmatrix A with entries in Fq such that f = det(X + A) + h, where h is a Fq -linear\ncombination of i \u00d7 i minors of X with 0 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 2. If h = 0, then f = det(X + A)\nand since Ev(f ) is obtained by evaluating f at all points of A\u03b4 (Fq ), we see that\nwH (Ev(det(X + A))) = wH (Ev(det(X))); hence, by Lemma 12, we then find that\nQ\nl\ni\nwH (Ev(det(X + A))) = l\u22121\ni=0 (q \u2212 q ) = d(l, 2l). Now suppose h 6= 0. Then l \u2265 2\nand as in Case 1, we can choose a minor M \u2208 supp(h) of maximum order, say r\n(i)\nwith r \u2264 l \u2212 2, and find an integer i with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l such that sa (M) = M for all\n(i)\na \u2208 Flq . Since M is of maximum order in supp(h), we see that sa (h) 6= 0 for all\n(i)\n\na \u2208 Flq . Also, since r \u2264 l \u2212 2, the nonzero polynomial sa (h) is of (total) degree at\nmost l \u2212 2. On the other hand, by developing the resulting determinant along the\n(i)\ni-th row, we see that sa (det(X + A)) is either the zero polynomial or a nonzero\n(i)\npolynomial in Fq [X] of degree l \u2212 1. It follows that sa (f ) 6= 0 for all a \u2208 Flq . Now,\nQ\nl\ni\nproceeding as in Subcase 1, we see that wH (Ev(f )) > l\u22121\ni=0 (q \u2212 q ), and so from\nLemma 12 we conclude that Ev(f ) cannot be a minimum weight codeword.\nQl\u22121\nThus we have shown that d(l, 2l) = i=0 (q l \u2212 q i ) and therefore established the\ninduction step in Case 2. This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nQd\nUsing the q-factorial function [d]q ! := i=1 (q i \u2212 1), the formula (4) for the\nminimum distance of C A (l, m) can be more compactly written as follows.\n(5)\n\nl+1\n2\n\nd(l, m) = q \u03b4\u2212(\n\n) [l] !.\nq\n\nNote that if l = 1, then the formula (4) as well as (5) for d(l, m) is in agreement\nwith the observations in Remark 11.\nRemark 17. By analyzing the proof of Theorem 16 in greater detail, one can show\nthat if l = l\u2032 , then the minimum weight codewords of C A (l, m) arise precisely from\nnonzero constant multiples of translates of the unique maximal minor, i.e., from\npolynomials of the form \u03bb det(X + A), with 0 6= \u03bb \u2208 Fq and A an l \u00d7 l matrix\nwith entries in Fq . Consequently, the number of minimum weight codewords in\n2\nC A (l, 2l) is equal to (q \u2212 1)q l . A more general version of these results will be\nproved in Sections 5 and 6.\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n9\n\n4. Automorphisms\nRecall that the (permutation) automorphism group Aut(C) of a code C \u2286 Fnq is\nthe set of all permutations \u03c3 of {1, . . . , n} such that (c\u03c3(1) , . . . , c\u03c3(n) ) \u2208 C for all\nc = (c1 , . . . , cn ) \u2208 C. Evidently, Aut(C) is a subgroup of the symmetric group on\n{1, . . . , n}. In this section, we shall show that the automorphism groups of affine\u0001\nGrassmann codes are large; more precisely, we shall show that Aut C A (l, m)\ncontains a subgroup of order\n(6)\n\nq\u03b4\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ) = n\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n2\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ) = q l d(l, m),\n\ni=0\n\ni=0\n\nwhere n and d(l, m) denote the length and the minimal distance of C A (l, m).\nDenote, as usual, by GLr (Fq ) the set of all invertible r\u00d7r matrices with entries in\nFq and by Mr\u00d7s (Fq ) the set of all r\u00d7s matrices with entries in Fq .

Let A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ). Then \u03c3u,A \u2208 Aut C A (l, m) .\nProof. Let r be any integer with 0 \u2264 r \u2264 l. In view of Lemma 9, a r \u00d7 r minor\nof XA\u22121 + u is a Fq -linear combination of i \u00d7 i minors of X, where 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r.\nConsequently, if f = f (X) \u2208 F (l, m), then f (XA\u22121 + u) \u2208 F (l, m). Moreover,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c3u,A (Ev(f )) = f (\u03c6u,A (P )) P \u2208A\u03b4 (Fq ) = Ev f (XA\u22121 + u) .\nIt follows that \u03c3u,A \u2208 Aut(C), where C = C A (l, m) = Ev (F (l, m)).\n\n\u0003\n\nObserve that \u03c60,I is the identity transformation of A\u03b4 , where 0 denotes the zero\nmatrix in Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) and I the identity matrix in GLl\u2032 (Fq ). Moreover, given any\nA, B \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u, v \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ), we have\n(7)\n\n\u03c6u,A \u25e6 \u03c6v,B = \u03c6w,AB\n\nand \u03c6\u22121\nu,A = \u03c6u\u2032 ,A\u22121 ,\n\nwhere w := vA\u22121 + u and u\u2032 = \u2212uA. This leads to the following observation-cumdefinition.\nDefinition 19. The set {\u03c6u,A : A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq )} forms a group\nwith respect to composition of maps and this group will be denoted by G(l, m).\nWe determine the group structure of G(l, m) in the following proposition.\nProposition 20. As a group G(l, m) is isomorphic to the semidirect product\nMl\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) \u22ca\u03b8 GLl\u2032 (Fq ), where the homomorphism \u03b8 : GLl\u2032 (Fq ) \u2192 Aut(Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ))\nis defined by \u03b8(A)(B) := BA\u22121 .\nProof. Recall that if G and H are any groups, and if \u03b8 : H \u2192 Aut(G) is any group\nhomomorphism, then the semidirect product G \u22ca\u03b8 H of G and H relative to \u03b8 is\nthe group whose underlying set is G \u00d7 H and whose group operation is defined\nby (g, h)(g \u2032 , h\u2032 ) = (g\u03b8(h)(g \u2032 ), hh\u2032 ). In our case, G is the additive group Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq )\nand H is the multiplicative group GLl\u2032 (Fq ), while \u03b8 : H \u2192 Aut(G) is given by\n\u03b8(A)(u) := uA\u22121 . Now observe that \u03b8(A) \u2208 Aut(G) for all A \u2208 H and \u03b8(A1 A2 ) =\n\u03b8(A1 )\u03b8(A2 ) for all A1 , A2 \u2208 H. So \u03b8 is indeed a homomorphism of H into Aut(G).\n\n\f10\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\n\u0001\nMoreover, in view of (7), the group operation (u, A)(v, B) = u + vA\u22121 , AB in\nG \u22ca\u03b8 H is consistent with the group operation in G(l, m). Thus (u, A) 7\u2192 \u03c6u,A\n\u0003\ngives an isomorphism of Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) \u22ca\u03b8 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) onto G(l, m).\nTheorem 21. The automorphism group of the affine Grassmann code C A (l,\u0001m)\ncontains a subgroup isomorphic to G(l, m). In particular, #Aut C A (l, m) is\ngreater than or equal to the quantity in (6).\nProof. In view\u0001 of Lemma 18, \u03c6u,A 7\u2192 \u03c3u,A gives a natural map from G(l, m) into\nAut C A (l, m) . It is readily seen that this map is a group homomorphism. So it\nsuffices to show that this homomorphism is injective. To this end, suppose \u03c3u,A\nis the identity permutation for some A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ). Then\n\u03c3u,A (Ev(f )) = Ev(f ) for all f \u2208 F (l, m), i.e.,\nf (P A\u22121 + u) = f (P )\n\nfor all f \u2208 F (l, m) and all P \u2208 A\u03b4 (Fq ).\n\nBy choosing P to be the zero matrix and letting f vary over all possible 1 \u00d7 1\nminors, we find that u = 0. Further, by choosing P = eij , i.e., P to be the l \u00d7 l\u2032\nmatrix with 1 in (i, j)-th position and 0 elsewhere, and again letting f vary over all\npossible 1 \u00d7 1 minors, we see that A\u22121 is the identity matrix I. Hence A = I. \u0003\nWe leave the question of the complete determination of the automorphism group\nAut(C A (l, m)) open for future investigation.\n5. Characterization of minimum weight codewords\nIn Section 3, we have calculated the minimum distance d(l, m) of the affine\nGrassmann code C A (l, m). In this section, we will give an explicit characterization\nof all of its codewords of weight d(l, m). One of the tools utilized will be a concept\n(i)\ninvolving the specialization function sa from Definition 13, which is defined below.\nDefinition 22. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i be an integer between 1 and l. The i-th\nrow-vanishing locus of f is the set\n(i)\n\nVf\n\n\u2032\n\n:= {a \u2208 Flq : s(i)\na (f ) = 0}.\n\nIt turns out that if a polynomial in F (l, m) is changed by a translation of the\nunderlying matrix X to X + u, then its i-th row-vanishing locus is a translate of\nthe corresponding locus of the transformed polynomial by the i-th row of u.\nLemma 23. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i be an integer between 1 and l. Then\n(i)\n\nVf\n\n(i)\n\n= ui + V\u03c6u,I (f )\n\nfor every u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ),\n\nwhere I denotes the identity matrix in GLl\u2032 (Fq ).\n(i)\n\n\u2032\n\nProof. Let u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) and let g := \u03c6u,I (f ). Suppose a \u2208 Vf . Define b \u2208 Flq\nby the relation a = ui + b. Note that\n(i)\n\n(8)\n\nsb (g) = g(X)|Xi =b = f (X + u)|Xi =b .\n(i)\n\nNow sa (f ) = f |Xi =a = 0. In particular, the polynomial f |Xi =a evaluates to 0\nfor every specialization of the rows X1 , . . . , Xi\u22121 , Xi+1 , . . . , Xl to arbitrary vec\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ntors in Flq . Since translations by a fixed vector in Flq give a bijection of Flq into\nitself, this implies that g|Xi =b evaluates to 0 for every specialization of the rows\n\u2032\nX1 , . . . , Xi\u22121 , Xi+1 , . . . , Xl to arbitrary vectors in Flq . Hence by the injectivity of\n(l\u22121)l\u2032\n\n, we see that g|Xi =b is the zero\nthe evaluation map Ev : F (l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1) \u2192 Fq\n(i)\n(i)\npolynomial. Thus, in view of (8), b \u2208 Vg , i.e., a \u2208 ui + Vf . This proves that\n(i)\n\nVf\n\n(i)\n\n\u2286 ui + Vg . The reverse inclusion is proved similarly.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n11\n\nCorollary 24. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i be an integer between 1 and l. Then\nthe i-th row-vanishing locus is either empty or an affine linear space over Fq , i.e.,\n\u2032\n(i)\n(i)\neither Vf = \u2205 or Vf = a + V for some a \u2208 Flq and a Fq -linear space V .\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nProof. Suppose Vf 6= \u2205. Then there exists some a \u2208 Vf . Let u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) be\nsuch that ui = a and uj = 0 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l with j 6= i. Also let g := \u03c6u,I (f ).\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nThen by Lemma 23, Vf = a + Vg . It remains to show that Vg is a subspace of\n(i)\n\n\u2032\n\nFlq . To this end, first note that 0 \u2208 Vg , thanks to the choice of a. Now observe\n(i)\n\nthat for any minor M \u2208 \u2206(l, m), we have s0 (M) = 0 if M involves the i-th\n(i)\n(i)\nrow and s0 (M) = M otherwise. Since s0 (g) = 0, Lemma 3 implies that g is a\nFq -linear combination of minors of X that involve the i-th row. Hence using the\n(i)\nmultilinearity of the determinant, we readily see that Vg is closed under addition\nand scalar multiplication.\n\u0003\nThe following result is an analogue of Lemma 23 for homogeneous linear transformations of the underlying matrix.\nLemma 25. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i be an integer between 1 and l. Then\no\nn\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nfor every A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ),\nV\u03c60,A (f ) = Vf A := aA : a \u2208 Vf\n\nwhere 0 denotes the zero matrix in Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ).\n\nProof. Let A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ). Consider h := \u03c60,A (f )., i.e., h \u2208 F (l, m) given by\nh(X) = f (XA\u22121 ). Observe that if, as before, X1 , . . . , Xl denote the row vectors of\nX, then X1 A\u22121 , . . . , Xl A\u22121 are the row-vectors of XA\u22121 . Thus the specialization\nXi = aA in h corresponds to the specialization Xi = a in f . The rest of the proof\nis similar to that of Lemma 23.\n\u0003\nUsing the row-vanishing locus, one can obtain a useful estimate for the Hamming\nweight of a codeword from C A (l, m).\nProposition 26. Let f \u2208 F (l, m) and let i be an integer between 1 and l. Suppose\n(i)\nt = #Vf . Then\n\u2032\n\nwH (Ev(f )) \u2265\n\n(9)\n\nql \u2212 t\nd(l, m).\n\u2032\nl\nq \u2212 q l\u2032 \u2212l\n(i)\n\nProof. In view of Lemma 14 and the definition of Vf , we see that\nX\n\u0001\nl\u2032\n(10)\nwH (Ev(f )) =\nwH (Ev(s(i)\na (f ))) \u2265 q \u2212 t d(l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1).\n(i)\n\na\u2208Flq\u2032 \\Vf\n\nOn the other hand, by Theorem 16,\n\u2032\n\nd(l, m) = q l(l \u2212l)\n\nl\u22121\nY\n\n\u2032\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ) and d(l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1) = q (l\u22121)(l \u2212l)\n\nl\u22122\nY\n\n(q l\u22121 \u2212 q j ).\n\nj=0\n\ni=0\n\nl\u2032\n\nHence, by a direct computation, d(l, m)/d(l \u2212 1, m \u2212 1) = q \u2212 q\nthis with (10), we obtain the desired result.\n\nl\u2032 \u2212l\n\n. Combining\n\u0003\n\nProposition 26 has the following important corollary for minimum weight codewords, which will be the key to our characterization of minimum weight codewords.\nCorollary 27. Let f \u2208 F (l, m). If Ev(f ) is a minimum weight codeword of\n\u2032\n(i)\nC A (l, m), then #Vf \u2265 q l \u2212l for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}.\n\n\f12\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n(i)\n\n\u2032\n\nProof. If #Vf < q l \u2212l for some i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, then by Proposition 26, we obtain\nwH (Ev(f )) > d(l, m).\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to formulate and prove a characterization of minimum weight\ncodewords of C A (l, m). Recall that if Y = (Yij ) is any l \u00d7 l\u2032 matrix and, as before,\nl \u2264 l\u2032 , then the leading maximal minor\u0001 of Y is the minor formed by the first l\ncolumns of Y , namely, det (Yij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l .\n\nTheorem 28. Let f \u2208 F (l, m). Then f is a minimum weight codeword of C A (l, m)\nif and only if f is in the G(l, m)-orbit of the leading maximal minor of X. In other\nwords, wH (Ev(f )) = d(l, m) if and only if f is the leading maximal minor of Y ,\nwhere Y = XA\u22121 + u for some A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ).\n\u0001\nProof. Let L := det (Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l denote the leading maximal minor of X. Suppose f is in the G(l, m)-orbit of L. Then, as noted in Section 4, the codewords\nEv(f ) and Ev(L) differ from each other by a permutation of the coordinates. Hence\nwH (Ev(f )) = wH (Ev(L)) = d(l, m), thanks to Lemma 12.\nTo prove the converse, suppose wH (Ev(f )) = d(l, m). Then f must be a nonzero\npolynomial since d(l, m) < q \u03b4 . Further, since l\u2032 \u2212 l \u2265 0, Corollary 27 implies that\n(i)\n(i)\nVf is nonempty for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. Choose ui \u2208 Vf for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l. Let\n\u2032\nu \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) be the l \u00d7 l matrix whose i-th row vector is ui for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l, and\nlet g := \u03c6u,I (f ). Then g is in the G(l, m)-orbit of f and by Lemma 23,\n(i)\n\nVf\n\n= ui + Vg(i)\n\nand 0 \u2208 Vg(i)\n\nfor each i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}.\n\n(i)\n\nThus, s0 (g) = 0 for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. Now observe that for any M \u2208 \u2206(l, m)\n(i)\nand any i \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, we have s0 (M) = 0 if M involves the i-th row of X and\nP\n(i)\ns0 (M) = M otherwise. Consequently, if g = M\u2208\u2206(l,m) aM M, where aM \u2208 Fq\nfor M \u2208 \u2206(l, m), then by Lemma 3, we see that aM = 0 for all M \u2208 \u222al\u22121\ni=0 \u2206i (l, m).\nThis proves that g is a Fq -linear combination of l \u00d7 l minors of X. In particular,\nif l\u2032 = l, then L being the only l \u00d7 l minors of X, we obtain g = cL for some\nc \u2208 Fq with c 6= 0. Since L = \u03c60,D (cL), where D denotes the l\u2032 \u00d7 l\u2032 diagonal matrix\ndiag (c, 1, . . . , 1) in GLl\u2032 (Fq ), we see that f is in the G(l, m)-orbit of L when l\u2032 = l.\n(1)\nNow suppose l < l\u2032 . Consider the first row-vanishing space Vg . In view of\n(1)\n(1)\nCorollary 24 and the fact that 0 \u2208 Vg , we see that Vg is a linear space over\n(1)\nFq . Moreover, Corollary 27 implies that the dimension of Vg is at least l\u2032 \u2212 l.\n(1)\nHence we can choose linearly independent vectors b1 , . . . , bl\u2032 \u2212l \u2208 Vg . Let b be\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe (l \u2212 l) \u00d7 l matrix whose i-th row vector is bi for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 l \u2212 l. Since b has\nfull rank, there exists an invertible matrix A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 *** 0 1 0 ... 0\n\uf8f7\n\u0001 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 *** 0 0 1 ... 0 \uf8f7\n.\nbA = 0(l\u2032 \u2212l)\u00d7l | Il\u2032 \u2212l = \uf8ec .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. . .. \uf8f7\n.. ..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed ..\n0\n\n***\n\n0\n\n0 0\n\n...\n\n1\n\nIndeed, the matrix on the right is essentially the reduced column-echelon form of\nb. We now consider the function h = h(X) = \u03c60,A (g(X)) = g(XA\u22121 ). Clearly, h\nis in the G(l, m)-orbit of g and hence of f ; in particular, wH (Ev(h)) = d(l, m) and\nh is a nonzero polynomial. By the multilinearity of the determinant, it can, just as\ng, be written as a Fq -linear combination of l \u00d7 l minors of X. For 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l\u2032 , let ej\n\u2032\ndenote the vector in Flq with 1 in the j-th position and 0 elsewhere. Observe that\nif M \u2208 \u2206l (l, m) is the minor formed by the columns of X indexed by j1 , . . . , jl ,\n(1)\n(1)\nwhere 1 \u2264 j1 < * * * < jl \u2264 l\u2032 , then sej (M) = 0 if j 6\u2208 {j1 , . . . , jl }, whereas sej (M)\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n13\n\nis a nonzero polynomial (and, in fact, \u00b1M1 , where M1 is a (l \u2212 1) \u00d7 (l \u2212 1) minor\nof X) if j \u2208 {j1 , . . . , jl }. Now by the choice of A and by Lemma 25, we have that\nP\n(1)\nej \u2208 Vh for all j such that l < j \u2264 l\u2032 . Consequently, if h = M\u2208\u2206l (l,m) aM M,\nwhere aM \u2208 Fq for M \u2208 \u2206l (l, m), then by Lemma 3, we see that aM = 0 for\nall those M in \u2206l (l, m) that involve the j-th column of X for some j > l. But\nthe only l \u00d7 l minor of X that does not involve the j-th column of X for some\nj > l is L. Hence h = cL for some c \u2208 Fq with c 6= 0. It follows that f is in the\nG(l, m)-orbit of L.\n\u0003\nIn case l\u2032 = l, the above theorem simplifies to the statement in Remark 17.\n6. Enumeration of minimum weight codewords\nIn this section, we let d = d(l, m) denote the minimum distance of C A (l, m) and\nAd the number of minimum weight codewords of C A (l, m). Having characterized\nthe codewords of weight d in the previous section, we now proceed to compute\nAd . Equivalently, we determine the number of polynomials f \u2208 F (l, m) giving rise\nto minimum weight codewords. We have seen in Section 4 that the finite group\nG(l, m) acts naturally on F (l, m). With this in view, we can use standard group\ntheory together with Theorem 28 to obtain the following.\n\u0001\nLemma 29. Let L = det (Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l be the leading maximal minor of X. Then\nAd =\n\n#G(l, m)\n,\n#Stab(L)\n\nwhere Stab(L) denotes the stabilizer of the minor L.\nProof. By Theorem 28, the cardinality of the G(l, m)-orbit of L is equal to Ad . On\nthe other hand, for any finite group acting on a finite set, the cardinality of the\norbit of an element is equal to the index of its stabilizer.\n\u0003\nThanks to Lemma 29, the computation of Ad reduces\u0001 to the problem of finding\nthe cardinality of the stabilizer of L := det (Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l . To this end, let us begin\nby observing that if f \u2208 F (l, m) is in the G(l, m)-orbit of L, i.e., if f = \u03c6u,A (L)\nfor some A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ), then\n(11) f = det(XM + m) for some M \u2208 Ml\u2032 \u00d7l (Fq ) of rank l and m \u2208 Ml\u00d7l (Fq ).\nIndeed, it suffices to take M to be the l\u2032 \u00d7 l matrix formed by the first l columns of\nA\u22121 and m to be the l \u00d7 l matrix formed by the first l columns of u, and observe\nthat rank(M ) = l since A is nonsingular and that the leading maximal minor of the\nl \u00d7 l\u2032 matrix XA\u22121 + u is det(XM + m). We shall now analyze when a polynomial\nf given by (11) is in the stabilizer of L. As usual, we denote by SLl (Fq ) the special\nlinear group of l \u00d7 l matrices over Fq , viz., SLl (Fq ) := {A \u2208 GLl (Fq ) : det A = 1}.\n\u0001\nLemma 30. Let L = det (Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l be the leading maximal minor of X. Also\nlet M \u2208 Ml\u2032 \u00d7l (Fq ) be of rank l and m \u2208 Ml\u00d7l (Fq ). Then L = det(XM + m) if\nand only if m = 0 and there exists E \u2208 SLl (Fq ) such that the first l rows of M E\nform the l \u00d7 l identity matrix, while the last l\u2032 \u2212 l rows are zero. In this case, the\nmatrix E in SLl (Fq ) is uniquely determined by M .\nProof. We start by showing the uniqueness of the matrix E. Suppose\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIl\nM E1 =\n= M E2 for some E1 , E2 \u2208 SLl (Fq ),\n0\n\nwhere Il denotes the l \u00d7 l identity matrix and 0 the (l\u2032 \u2212 l) \u00d7 l zero matrix. Then\nM (E2 \u2212 E1 ) = 0. Since M has full rank, this can only happen if E1 = E2 .\n\n\f14\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nTo prove the equivalence, first suppose there exists E \u2208 SLl (Fq ) such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nIl\n,\n(12)\nME =\n0\nand also suppose m = 0. Then\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\nIl\n= L.\ndet(XM + m) = det(XM ) = det(XM E) = det X\n0\nConversely, suppose L = det(XM + m). Since M has full rank, there exists\nN \u2208 Ml\u2032 \u00d7l (Fq ) such that N M = m. Hence L = det(XM + m) = det((X + N )M ).\nUsing Cauchy-Binet formula (Lemma 10) and the notation therein, we now find\nX\n(13)\nL=\ndet((X + N )I ) det(MI ),\nI\n\nwhere the sum is over all subsets I of {1, . . . , l\u2032 } of cardinality l. For any such I,\nLemma 9 implies that det((X + N )I ) is the sum of det(X I ) and a Fq -linear combination of minors of X I of order < l. Hence, comparing terms of total degree l in\n(13), we obtain\nX\n\u2217\n(14)\nL = det(X I ) =\ndet(X I ) det(MI ), where I \u2217 := {1, . . . , l}.\nI\n\nConsequently, in view of Lemma 3, det(MI \u2217 ) = 1, while det(MI ) = 0 for every\nI \u2286 {1, . . . , l\u2032 } with #I = l and I 6= I \u2217 . Define E := MI\u22121\nIt is clear that\n\u2217 .\nE \u2208 SLl (Fq ). Moreover, by the choice of E, the first l rows of M E form the l \u00d7 l\nidentity matrix Il . We claim that for any i > l, the i-th row M Ei of M E is zero. To\nsee this, write M Ei = (b1 , . . . , bl ). Choose any j \u2208 I \u2217 and let I := (I \u2217 \u222a {i}) \\ {j}.\nThen I \u2286 {1, . . . , l\u2032 } with #I = l and det(MI ) = 0 since I 6= I \u2217 . On the other\nhand, det(MI ) = det(MI E). Now, since the first l\u22121 elements of I are contained in\n{1, . . . , l}, the first l \u2212 1 rows of the matrix MI E form the matrix obtained from Il\nby deleting its j-th row. This implies that 0 = det(MI E) = \u00b1(MI E)lj = \u00b1(M E)ij .\nBy varying j over I \u2217 , we obtain M Ei = (0, . . . , 0). This proves the claim. It remains\nto show that m = 0. We have noted earlier that there is N \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ) such that\nm = N M . Hence\nL = det(XM +m) = det((X+N )M ) = det((X+N )M E) = det((Xij +Nij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l ),\nwhere the penultimate equality follows since E \u2208 SLl (Fq ) and the last equality\nfollows since M E satisfies (12). Using Lemma 9 together with Lemma 3, by comparing the coefficients of (l \u2212 1) \u00d7 (l \u2212 1) minors, we find Nij = 0 for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 l.\nBut then mE = N (M E) = (Nij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l = 0, thanks to (12). Since E is invertible,\nthis implies that m = 0.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to compute the cardinality of the stabilizer of the leading\nmaximal minor.\n\u0001\nLemma 31. Let L = det (Xij )1\u2264i,j\u2264l be the leading maximal minor of X. Then\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nl\u22121\nl \u22121\nY\nq l(l \u2212l) Y l\u2032\n#Stab(L) =\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n(q \u2212 q i )\nq\u22121\nj=0\n\ni=l\n\nProof. Let A \u2208 GLl\u2032 (Fq ) and u \u2208 Ml\u00d7l\u2032 (Fq ). Suppose \u03c6u,A (L) = L. First we write\nA = (M | R) where M \u2208 Ml\u2032 \u00d7l (Fq ) and R \u2208 Ml\u2032 \u00d7(l\u2032 \u2212l) (Fq ) are matrices formed,\nrespectively, by the first l columns of A and the remaining l\u2032 \u2212 l columns of A.\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n15\n\nSimilarly, we write u = (m | r). Then, as in (11), L = det(XM + m). Hence by\nLemma 30, m = 0 and moreover, there exists a unique E \u2208 SLl (Fq ) such that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIl\nE\n0\nR ,\n= A (M | R) =\n(15)\nA\n0 Il\u2032 \u2212l\n0\n\nwhere 0 denotes the zero matrix of an appropriate size and, as before, Il denotes\nthe l \u00d7 l identity matrix. The matrices R and r do not have any effect on \u03c6u,A (L)\nand can therefore be chosen freely. However, R has to be chosen in such a way\nthat the matrix on the right hand side of (15) has full rank. This means that the\nlast l\u2032 \u2212 l rows of R must be linearly independent. It follows that #Stab(L) is the\nproduct of #SLl (Fq ) and the following terms:\n\u2032\n\nq l(l \u2212l) ,\n\u2032\nq l(l \u2212l) ,\nQl\u2032 \u2212l\u22121\n\nfor the choice of r,\nfor the choice of the first l rows of R, and\n\u2032\n(q l \u2212l \u2212 q i ), for the choice of the last l\u2032 \u2212 l rows of R.\ni=0\nQl\u22121\nSince #SLl (Fq ) = (q \u2212 1)\u22121 j=0 (q l \u2212 q j ), the lemma is proved.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now obtain the main result of this section concerning the number of codewords of C A (l, m) of weight d(l, m). The result is best formulated using the Gaussian binomial coefficient defined, for any integers k and n with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, as follows.\n\u0014 \u0015\n(q n \u2212 1)(q n \u2212 q) . . . (q n \u2212 q k\u22121 )\nn\n[n]q !\n= k\n.\n(16)\n:=\n[k]q ![n \u2212 k]q !\n(q \u2212 1)(q k \u2212 q) . . . (q k \u2212 q k\u22121 )\nk q\n\nIt is well-known that (16) is a monic polynomial\n\u0002 \u0003 in q of degree k(n \u2212 k) with\nnonnegative integral coefficients. In particular, nn q = 1.\n\nTheorem 32. The number Ad of codewords of weight d(l, m) of the affine Grassmann code C A (l, m) is given by\n\u0014 \u2032\u0015\nl2 l\nAd = (q \u2212 1)q\n.\nl q\nProof. Using Proposition 20 we see that\n#G(l, m) = #M\n\nl\u00d7l\u2032\n\n(Fq ) * #GL (Fq ) = q\nl\u2032\n\nll\u2032\n\n\u2032\nlY\n\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n(q l \u2212 q i ).\n\ni=0\n\nHence the desired result follows from Lemmas 29 and 31.\nl\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0003\nl2\n\nFor l = 1, we obtain Ad = q(q \u22121), whereas for l = l, we obtain Ad = (q\u22121)q .\nThis is in agreement with Remarks 11 and 17, respectively.\n7. Connection with Grassmann codes\nGrassmann codes, denoted by C(l, m), are [n, k]q -linear codes defined for any\npositive integers l, m satisfying 1 \u2264 l \u2264 m, where\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\nm\n(q m \u2212 1)(q m \u2212 q) . . . (q m \u2212 q l\u22121 )\nm\nn :=\n:=\nand\nk\n:=\n.\nl q\n(q l \u2212 1)(q l \u2212 q) . . . (q l \u2212 q l\u22121 )\nl\nThe case l = m is trivial and in general, there is a natural equivalence between\nC(l, m) and C(m \u2212 l, m). With this in view, we shall assume 1 \u2264 l < m and that\nm \u2212 l \u2265 l. Thus, if we set l\u2032 := m \u2212 l, then we have 1 \u2264 l \u2264 l\u2032 and l + l\u2032 = m,\nexactly as in the basic set-up of Sections 2 through 6.\nA quick way to define C(l, m) is to say that these are linear codes associated to\nthe projective system obtained from the Pl\u00fccker embedding of the Grassmann variety Gl,m in the projective space Pk\u22121 over Fq . Recall that the Grassmann variety\n(also known as the Grassmannian) Gl,m over Fq is the space of all l-dimensional\n\n\f16\n\nPETER BEELEN, SUDHIR R. GHORPADE, AND TOM H\u00d8HOLDT\n\nsubspaces of the m-dimensional vector space Fm\nq over Fq . The Pl\u00fccker embedk\u22121\nl m\nding maps Gl,m (Fq ) into P\n= P(\u2227 Fq ) by sending a l-dimensional subspace W\nspanned by w1 , . . . , wl to the class of w1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 wl . To obtain this a little more\nconcretely, one can proceed as follows. Let\nI(l, m) = {\u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1l ) \u2208 Zl : 1 \u2264 \u03b11 < * * * < \u03b1l \u2264 m}\nbe an indexing set [ordered, say, lexicographically] for the points of Pk\u22121 (Fq ). Given\nany \u03b1 \u2208 I(l, m) and any l \u00d7 m matrix A = (aij ), let\n\u0001\np\u03b1 (A) = determinant of the \u03b1-th submatrix of A := det ai\u03b1j 1\u2264i,j\u2264l .\n\nNow, for any W \u2208 Gl,m (Fq ), we can find a l \u00d7 m matrix AW whose rows give a\nbasis of W , and then\np(W ) = (p\u03b1 (AW ))\u03b1\u2208I(l,m) \u2208 Pk\u22121\n\nis called the Pl\u00fccker coordinate of W . It is easy to see that this depends only on W\nand not on the choice of AW . Moreover, The map W 7\u2192 p(W ) of Gl,m (Fq ) \u2192 Pk\u22121\nis precisely the Pl\u00fccker embedding; it is well-known that this is injective and its\nimage equals the zero locus of certain quadratic polynomials. Henceforth, we shall\nidentify W with p(W ). The definition of C(l, m) as the codes corresponding to the\nprojective system in Pk\u22121 given by Gl,m (Fq ) amounts to the following.\n\u2217\nl m\nLet G(l, m) = (\u2227l Fm\nq ) denote the space of linear forms on \u2227 Fq [this can\nm\u2212l m\nbe identified with (\u2227\nFq )] and let {Q1 , . . . , Qn } be (arbitrary, but fixed, lifts\nof) points in \u2227l Fm\ncorresponding\nto the elements of Gl,m (Fq ) in Pk\u22121 . Now the\nq\nevaluation map\nEv : G(l, m) \u2192 An (Fq ) defined by\n\nEv(g) := (g(Q1 ), . . . , g(Qn ))\n\nis injective (since the Pl\u00fccker embedding is nondegenerate) and its image is precisely\nthe Grassmann code C(l, m).\nTo relate C(l, m) to C A (l, m), let us first note that the projective space Pk\u22121 is\ncovered by affine spaces U\u03b1 \u2243 Ak\u22121 , where U\u03b1 := {p \u2208 Pk\u22121 : p\u03b1 = 1} and \u03b1 varies\nover I(l, m). It is a classical fact that the intersection B\u03b1 := Gl,m \u2229U\u03b1 is isomorphic\nto an affine space of dimension \u03b4 := ll\u2032 = l(m \u2212 l). This isomorphism is described\nexplicitly by the Basic Cell Lemma of [6]. In effect, if W \u2208 B\u03b1 , then the l \u00d7 m\nmatrix AW associated to W can be chosen in such a way that the \u03b1-th submatrix of\nAW is the identity matrix. Now if BW denotes the l\u00d7l\u2032 matrix formed by removing\nfrom AW its \u03b1-th submatrix, then the entries of BW can be viewed as variables.\nMoreover, the k-tuple p(W ) formed by the l \u00d7 l minors of AW corresponds to the\nk-tuple formed by arbitrary sized minors of BW . Thus, evaluating linear forms at\npoints of the affine open cell B\u03b1 of Gl,m corresponds to evaluating linear forms in\narbitrary sized minors of BW at the points of the \u03b4-dimensional affine space over Fq .\nIn other words, the evaluation map Ev : G(l, m) \u2192 An reduces to the evaluation\nmap on F (l, m) considered in Section 2.\nRemark 33. We hope that the above discussion clarifies the genesis of the terminology affine Grassmann for the codes C A (l, m) studied in this paper. Indeed, this\nterminology arises from the fact that in essence, we consider an affine open piece\nof the Grassmann variety instead of the full Grassmann variety. However, this terminology should not be confused with the so called affine Grassmannian, which is\nusually an infinite dimensional object obtained from the Laurent power series valued points of an algebraic group. Indeed, it appears unlikely that interesting and\nefficient codes could be built from the infinite dimensional affine Grassmannian,\nand hence there does not seem to be any harm in calling the codes C A (l, m) as\naffine Grassmann codes.\n\n\fAFFINE GRASSMANN CODES\n\n17\n\nIt may be worthwhile to compare the basic parameters of C(l, m) and C A (l, m).\nThis is done in Figure 1 below. While the results for C A (l, m) are proved in the\nprevious sections, those for C(l, m) can be found, for example, in [13] and [6].\n\nLength\nDimension\nMinimum\ndistance\n\nC(l, m)\n\nC A (l, m)\n\n\u0002m\u0003\n\nq\u03b4\n\nl q\n\nm\nl\n\nq\u03b4\n\n= q \u03b4 + q \u03b4\u22121 + 2q \u03b4\u22122 + * * *\n\nm\nl\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n2 Ql\u22121\nl\ni\nq \u03b4\u2212l\ni=0 (q \u2212 q )\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\u22121\n=q \u2212q\n\u2212 q \u03b4\u22122 + * * *\n\n\u0003\n2\u0002\n(q \u2212 1)q l m\u2212l\nl\nq\n= O(q \u03b4+1 )\n\n\u0002 \u0003\nNumber of\n(q \u2212 1) m\nl q\n= O(q \u03b4+1 )\nmin. weight\ncodewords\n\nFigure 1. A comparison of Grassmann and affine Grassmann codes\n\nIt may be noted that the two classes of codes are comparable. While the affine\nGrassmann codes are shorter than Grassmann codes and have a better rate, the\nGrassmann codes fare better in terms of the minimum distance and also the relative\ndistance. In spite of the connection between the two codes indicated above, there\ndoes not seem to be a straightforward way to deduce the properties of one code\ndirectly from that of the other. However, the growing literature on Grassmann\ncodes can provide pointers for further research on affine Grassmann codes, whereas\nthe analogy of affine Grassmann codes with Reed-Muller codes and results obtained\nin this paper concerning their automorphisms may provide further impetus for the\nstudy of Grassmann codes.\nAcknowledgments\nThe second named author would like to thank the Department of Mathematics of the\nTechnical University of Denmark for its warm hospitality during his visits in June 2008\nand April 2009 when some of this work was carried out.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
