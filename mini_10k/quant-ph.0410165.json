Two stabilizer\nstates are called LC equivalent if there exists a local Clifford operation which maps the first state to\nthe second. We present a finite set of invariants which completely characterizes the LC equivalence\nclass of any stabilizer state. Our invariants have simple descriptions within the binary framework\nin which stabilizer states are usually described.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a\n\nStabilizer states constitute a class of multipartite pure\nquantum states which is of considerable interest in quantum information theory (QIT) and quantum computing\n(QC). A stabilizer state on n qubits is defined as a simultaneous eigenvector of a maximal set of commuting observables in the Pauli group, where the latter is the group\ngenerated by all n-fold tensor products of the Pauli matrices and the identity. To name but two of their presently\nmost prominent applications, stabilizer states firstly appear as codewords of quantum stabilizer codes in the theory of quantum error-correction [1], and, secondly, they\nare the resources for QC in a computation model where\nonly single-qubit measurements are performed (the oneway quantum computer [2]). In order to understand the\nrole of stabilizer states in these and other QIT and QC\ntasks, the mathematical and physical properties of these\nstates have recently been studied in a number of accounts\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. One central problem in this research is\nthe classification of stabilizer states under local unitary\n(LU) equivalence. Indeed, next to the natural relevance\nof this issue in the study of the entanglement properties of\nstabilizer states, it is also of particular importance both\nin the development of the one-way quantum computer\nand in the coding theoretic aspect of stabilizer states. In\nthis paper we consider a restricted version of LU equivalence of stabilizer states, in that we consider only those\nlocal unitary operations which belong to the local Clifford\ngroup (LC). The local Clifford group consists of all local\nunitary operators which map the Pauli group to itself\nunder conjugation. We will call two stabilizer states LC\nequivalent if there exists a local Clifford operator which\nmaps the first state to the second.\nThe restriction of considering LC equivalence rather\nthan general LU equivalence has two main motivations.\nFirstly, the problem of general LU equivalence is difficult\nand it is therefore appropriate to first consider a more\nmanageable subproblem, for which LC equivalence is a\nsuitable candidate - given the very explicit connections\nbetween stabilizers states, the Pauli group and the (local) Clifford group. Secondly, this so-called 'subproblem'\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: maarten.vandennest@esat.kuleuven.ac.be\n\nmight in fact not be a subproblem at all, as the natural\nquestion exists whether every two LU equivalent stabilizer states are necessarily LC equivalent. Although this\nquestion is to date unanswered in general, our work [9],\nfollowing work performed in Ref. [10], shows that this\nassertion is at least true for some interesting subclasses\nof stabilizer states and a positive answer to this question\nis widely believed.\nIn the following we study LC invariants of stabilizer\nstates, i.e. functions in the entries of a stabilizer state\nwhich take on equal values in LC equivalent states. We\nconstruct a finite complete set of invariants, which characterizes the LC equivalence class of any stabilizer state.\nSuch a study of LC invariants primarily serves to obtain\na characterization of LC equivalence classes of stabilizer\nstates and to gain insight in the structure of these classes,\nand to a lesser extent to obtain algorithms which can\nrecognize LC equivalence of two given states. Indeed,\nan efficient algorithm to recognize LC equivalence of stabilizer states has recently been presented in our earlier\nwork and there is little hope that equally efficient algorithms can be constructed on the basis of invariants (see\nbelow). Therefore, we believe that the main merit of the\npresent result is, firstly, that it gives a finite characterization of the LC equivalence class of any stabilizer state\nand, secondly, that our invariants exhibit a very transparent structure in terms of the stabilizer formalism.\nLet us now start by recalling the basic notions concerning stabilizer states and the local Clifford group. A\nstabilizer state |\u03c8i on n qubits is the unique simultaneous\neigenvector with eigenvalue 1 of a set of n commuting and\nindependent observables in the Pauli group Gn . The latter consists of all operators of the form \u03b1\u03c3a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3an ,\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 {\u00b11, \u00b1i} is an overall phase factor and \u03c3ai\nis either the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix or one of the Pauli\nmatrices \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z , for every i = 1, . . . , n. The stabilizer S(\u03c8) of |\u03c8i is the set of all Pauli operators which\nhave |\u03c8i as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. It is well\nknown (see e.g. [11]) that the stabilizer formalism has\nan equivalent formulation in terms of algebra over the\nfield F2 = GF(2), where arithmetic is performed modulo\n2. The heart of this binary representation is an encoding\nof the Pauli matrices by pairs of bits, writing \u03c30 = \u03c300 ,\n\n\f2\n\u03c3x = \u03c301 , \u03c3z = \u03c310 and \u03c3y = \u03c311 and subsequently\n\u03c3w1 w1\u2032 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3wn wn\u2032 =: \u03c3(w,w\u2032 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere w := (w1 , . . . , wn ), w\u2032 := (w1\u2032 , . . . , wn\u2032 ) \u2208 Fn2\nare n-dimensional binary vectors. Note that the information about the ith qubit is distributed over the ith\ncomponents of the vectors w and w\u2032 . Identifying every\nPauli operator in an n-qubit stabilizer S(\u03c8) with its 2ndimensional binary index vector, one can show that S(\u03c8)\ncorresponds to an n-dimensional self-dual linear subspace\nS\u03c8 of F2n\n2 ; the self-duality of this subspace is with respect\nto a symplectic inner product on F2n\n2 .\nThe Clifford group C1 on one qubit is the group of all\n2 \u00d7 2 unitary operators which map \u03c3u to \u03b1u \u03c3\u03c0(u) under\nconjugation, where u = x, y, z, for some \u03b1u = \u00b11 and\nsome permutation \u03c0 of {x, y, z}. The local Clifford group\nCnl on n qubits is the n-fold tensor product of C1 with\nitself. In the binary stabilizer framework, local Clifford\noperations U \u2208 Cnl correspond to nonsingular 2n \u00d7 2n\nbinary matrices Q of the block form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nA B\n,\n(2)\nQ=\nC D\nwhere the n \u00d7 n blocks A, B, C, D are diagonal [5]. We\ndenote the diagonal entries of A, B, C, D by ai , bi , ci , di ,\nrespectively. The n submatrices\n\u0014\n\u0015\nai b i\nQi :=\n\u2208 GL(2, F2 )\n(3)\nci di\ncorrespond to the tensor factors of U . We denote the\ngroup of all such Q by Cnl . In the binary stabilizer framework, two n-qubit stabilizer states |\u03c8i, |\u03c8 \u2032 i are LC equivalent if and only if there exists an operator Q \u2208 Cnl such\nthat QS\u03c8 = S\u03c8\u2032 , i.e., Q maps the space S\u03c8 to the space\nS\u03c8 \u2032 .\nFinally, let us recall the definition of support in this\ncontext of stabilizers, which will be of considerable importance in the following. The support supp(v) of any\nvector v \u2208 F2n\n2 is the set\nsupp(v) = {i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} | (vi , vn+i ) 6= (0, 0)}.\nNote that supp(v) contains exactly those i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}\nsuch that the ith tensor factor of \u03c3v differs from the identity.\nWe are now in a position to state the first result of\nthis paper. In theorem 1 a finite set of invariants which\ncharacterizes the LC equivalence class of any stabilizer\nstate, is presented.\nTheorem 1 Let |\u03c8i be a stabilizer state on n qubits.\nLet r \u2208 N0 and consider subsets \u03c9 k , \u03c9 kl \u2286 {1, . . . , n}\nfor every k, l \u2208 {1, . . . , r} with k < l. Denote \u03a9 :=\n\u03a9\n(\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , . . . , \u03c9 12 , \u03c9 13 , . . . ) and let Tn,r\n(\u03c8) be the set con1\nr\nsisting of all tuples (v , . . . , v ) \u2208 S\u03c8 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S\u03c8 satisfying\nsupp(v k ) = \u03c9 k , supp(v k + v l ) = \u03c9 kl .\n\n(4)\n\n\u03a9\nThen (i) |Tn,r\n(\u03c8)| is an LC invariant and (ii) the LC\nequivalence class of |\u03c8i is completely determined by the\n\u03a9\nvalues of all invariants |Tn,n\n(\u03c8)| (i.e. where r = n).\n\nProof: Statement (i) is trivial. To prove (ii), let |\u03c8i\nand |\u03c8 \u2032 i be two stabilizer states on n qubits such that\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n|Tn,n\n(\u03c8)| = |Tn,n\n(\u03c8 \u2032 )| for every tuple \u03a9 as defined above.\nWe will show that this implies that |\u03c8i and |\u03c8 \u2032 i are LC\nequivalent. Fix a basis {v 1 , . . . , v n } of S\u03c8 and define the\ntuple of sets \u03a9\u2217 = (\u03c9\u22171 , . . . , \u03c9\u221712 , . . . ) such that\n\u03c9\u2217k = supp(v k ), \u03c9\u2217kl = supp(v k + v l ),\n\n(5)\n\nfor every k, l = 1, . . . , n with k < l. It follows that\n\u03a9\u2217\n\u03a9\u2217\n|Tn,n\n(\u03c8)| is nonzero, and therefore |Tn,n\n(\u03c8 \u2032 )| is nonzero\nas well, since these numbers are equal by assumption.\nTherefore, there exist vectors w1 , . . . , wn \u2208 S\u03c8\u2032 such that\nsupp(wk ) = \u03c9\u2217k , supp(wk + wl ) = \u03c9\u2217kl ,\n\n(6)\n\nfor every k, l. Expressions (5) and (6) show that\nk\nk\n) = (0, 0)\n) = (0, 0) iff (wik , wn+i\n(vik , vn+i\nk\nl\nk\nl\n(vik , vn+i\n) = (vil , vn+i\n) iff (wik , wn+i\n) = (wil , wn+i\n),\n\nfor every i, k, l = 1, . . . , n. This implies the existence of\nn operators Qi \u2208 GL(2, F2 ) such that\n\u0014 k \u0015 \u0014 k \u0015\nwi\nvi\n(7)\n=\nQi\nk\nk\nwn+i\nvn+i\nfor every i, k = 1, . . . , n, and the operators Qi consequently constitute an operator Q \u2208 Cnl such that\nQv k = wk for every k = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, the space\nQS\u03c8 is spanned by the vectors w1 , . . . , wn . Moreover,\nthese vectors are linearly independent, as they are the\nimages of a linearly independent set under an invertible\nlinear transformation. Therefore, {w1 , . . . , wn } is a basis\nof S\u03c8\u2032 (since the latter is an n-dimensional vector space)\nand we obtain QS\u03c8 = S\u03c8\u2032 . This proves the theorem. \u0003\nLet us briefly discuss this result. The invariants in\ntheorem 1 are presented as cardinalities of certain subsets\nof S\u03c8 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S\u03c8 , which are defined in terms of simple\nconstraints on the supports of their elements. Note that\nfor r = 1 these invariants simply count the number of\nelements in the stabilizer with a prescribed support, i.e.,\nfor every \u03c9 \u2286 {1, . . . , n} one has an invariant\n|{v \u2208 S\u03c8 | supp(v) = \u03c9}|.\n\n(8)\n\nThese invariants are in fact 'local versions' of the so-called\nweight distribution of a stabilizer, a well known concept\nin quantum (and classical) coding theory which is e.g.\nused to produce bounds on how good codes can be (see\ne.g. [12]). Our invariants for r \u2265 2 are in this respect\ngeneralizations of this well known notion.\nWhile the structure of the invariants in theorem 1 is\nindeed very transparent, a direct calculation of the num\u03a9\nbers |Tn,r\n(\u03c8)| is likely to be hard. It is in this context\ninteresting to consider the following variant of theorem\n1, which presents an alternative complete family of LC\ninvariants:\n\n\f3\nTheorem 2 Using the same notations as in theorem 1,\n\u03a9\nlet Vn,r\n(\u03c8) be the vector space consisting of all tuples\n1\n(v , . . . , v r ) \u2208 S\u03c8 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S\u03c8 satisfying\nsupp(v k ) \u2286 \u03c9 k , supp(v k + v l ) \u2286 \u03c9 kl .\n\n(9)\n\n\u03a9\nThen (i) the dimension of Vn,r\n(\u03c8) is an LC invariant\nand (ii) the LC equivalence class of |\u03c8i is completely de\u03a9\ntermined by the values of all invariants dim(Vn,n\n(\u03c8)).\n\nProof: Statement (i) is again trivial. We now prove\n(ii). Let \u03c9 \u2286 {1, . . . , n} and define the functions \u03b4\u03c9 , \u01eb\u03c9 :\nF2n\n2 \u2192 C, respectively, by \u03b4\u03c9 (w) = 1 if supp(w) = \u03c9 and\n\u03b4\u03c9 (w) = 0 otherwise, and \u01eb\u03c9 (w) = 1 if supp(w) \u2286 \u03c9 and\n\u01eb\u03c9 (w) = 0 otherwise. It is then straightforward to show\nthe following relations:\nX\n\u01eb\u03c9 =\n\u03b4\u03c9 \u2032\n\u03c9 \u2032 \u2286\u03c9\n\n\u03b4\u03c9 = (\u22121)|\u03c9|\n\n\u2032\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)|\u03c9 | \u01eb\u03c9\u2032 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c9 \u2032 \u2286\u03c9\n\nthe first of which is trivial and the second of which can be\nverified using straightforward combinatorics. Letting \u03a9\nbe a tuple of sets \u03c9 k , \u03c9 kl \u2286 {1, . . . , n}, with k, l = 1, . . . , r\nand k < l, it follows that\n(\n)(\n)\nX Y\nY\n\u03a9\n|Tn,r\n(\u03c8)| =\n\u03b4\u03c9k (v k )\n\u03b4\u03c9kl (v k + v l )\nk\n\n\u03a9\n|Vn,r\n(\u03c8)|\n\n=\n\n(\nX Y\nk\n\nk<l\n\nk\n\n)(\n\n\u01eb\u03c9k (v )\n\nY\n\nk<l\n\nk\n\nl\n\n)\n\n\u01eb\u03c9kl (v + v ) ,\n\nwhere the sums run over all r-tuples (v 1 , . . . , v r ) \u2208 S\u03c8\u00d7r .\n\u03a90\nUsing (10) one finds that every invariant |Tn,r\n(*)| is a lin\u03a9\near combination of the invariants {|Vn,r (*)|}\u03a9 with constant coefficients (and vice versa). The proof then readily follows after applying theorem 1 and noting that the\ndimension of any vector space V over F2 is given by\ndim(V) = log2 |V|.\n\u0003\n\u03a9\n(\u03c8))\nThe main advantage of the invariants dim(Vn,r\n\u03a9\nover the |Tn,r\n(\u03c8)|'s is that in the former case one is\ndealing with (dimensions of) vector spaces, which are\nmuch more manageable from a computational point of\nview. Let us illustrate this with a simple example: take\n\u03c9 \u2286 {1, . . . , n} as before and consider the invariant\n|{v \u2208 S\u03c8 | supp(v) \u2286 \u03c9}|,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is the counterpart of (8) in theorem 2. This invariant can indeed be calculated efficiently as follows: let\nv 1 , . . . , v n be a basis of S\u03c8 and let S = [v 1 | . . . |v n ] be\nthe 2n \u00d7 n binary matrix which has the vectors v j as its\ncolumns (the matrix S is generally referred to as a generator matrix of the stabilizer). Denoting by SiT the 2 \u00d7 n\nsubmatrix of S which is obtained by assembling the ith\nand the (n+i)th row of S, for every i = 1, . . . , n, one readily verifies that the invariant (11) is equal to the corank\n\n(i.e. the dimension of the kernel) over F2 of the matrix\nS\u03c9 := (SjT )j\u2208\u03c9\u0304 , where \u03c9\u0304 denotes the complement of \u03c9 in\n{1, . . . , n}. Note that the calculation of the (co)rank of a\nmatrix over any field indeed requires only a polynomial\nnumber of operations in the dimensions of this matrix.\nThis shows that the invariant (11) can easily be calculated when a generator matrix of the stabilizer is known\n(note that a stabilizer state in indeed usually presented in\nterms of a generator matrix). A straightforward continuation of the above argument shows that, e.g. for r = 2,\n\u03a9\nan invariant dim(Vn,2\n(\u03c8)), where \u03a9 = (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 12 ) with\n1\n2\n12\n\u03c9 , \u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2286 {1, . . . , n}, is equal to the corank of the\nmatrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nS\u03c9 1\n*\n\uf8f0 *\nS\u03c9 2 \uf8fb ,\n(12)\nS\u03c912 S\u03c912\n\nand analogous results hold for arbitrary degrees. This\n\u03a9\nshows that the invariants dim(Vn,r\n(\u03c8)) can indeed be\nevaluated efficiently; moreover, the information needed\nto perform the calculation (i.e., the matrices S\u03c9 ) can easily be extracted from a generator matrix of the stabilizer.\nThere is in fact a close relationship between the LC in\u03a9\nvariants dim(Vn,r\n(\u03c8)) and the polynomial LU invariants\nthat we considered in [6]. In both cases, invariants correspond to dimensions of certain subspaces of S\u03c8 \u00d7 * * *\u00d7 S\u03c8\nthat are defined in terms of constraints on the supports\nof their elements. In fact, if r equals 1 or 2 then the\nLC invariants in theorems 1 and 2 are also LU invari\u03a9\n(\u03c8)) and\nants; in other words, the invariants dim(Vn,r\n\u03a9\n|Tn,r (\u03c8)| take on equal values on LU equivalent stabilizer states. This property is well known (see e.g. [13])\nfor the invariants (8) and (11), corresponding to r = 1.\nIn order to prove this assertion for r = 2, let \u03a8 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\nbe (the projector associated with) a stabilizer state and\ntake \u03a9 = (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 , \u03c9 12 ). Then one can readily verify that\n\u03a9\n|Vn,2\n(\u03c8)| is, up to a multiplicative constant, equal to\nTr {(Tr\u03c9\u03041 \u03a8) (Tr\u03c9\u03042 \u03a8) (Tr\u03c9\u030412 \u03a8)} ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is manifestly invariant under the action of local\nunitary operators (the operation Tr\u03c9 denotes tracing out\nall qubits in the set \u03c9). Moreover, this also shows that\n\u03a9\nevery |Tn,2\n(\u03c8)| is an LU invariant, as it can be written as a linear combination with constant coefficients\n\u03a9\nof the |Vn,2\n(\u03c8)|'s. Summarizing the current discussion,\n\u03a9\nif r equals 1 or 2 then the invariants dim(Vn,r\n(\u03c8)) and\n\u03a9\n|Tn,r (\u03c8)| take on equal values on LU equivalent stabilizer\nstates. It is clear that this result is very interesting in\nrelation with the problem whether LC equivalence and\nLU equivalence of stabilizer states are identical notions.\nFinally, we wish to note that the two main results in\nthis paper are to be regarded as upper bounds on the\nmaximal r which needs to be considered in order to obtain a complete set of invariants. Indeed, it is likely that\nonly invariants corresponding to (substantially) lower r\nneed to be considered in order to recognize LC equivalence between two stabilizer states. One indication for\n\n\f4\nthis conjecture is the proof of theorem 1, which shows\nthat all the information of the LC equivalence class of a\ngiven state |\u03c8i is in fact contained within a single invari\u03a9\u2217\nant |Tn,n\n(\u03c8)|. A second state |\u03c8 \u2032 i is LC equivalent to |\u03c8i\nif and only if\n\u03a9\u2217\n\u03a9\u2217\n(\u03c8 \u2032 )|,\n(\u03c8)| = |Tn,n\n|Tn,n\n\nset of invariants. Our invariants have simple descriptions\nwithin the binary stabilizer framework, in that they are\nequal to dimensions of certain subspaces of S\u03c8 \u00d7 * * *\u00d7 S\u03c8 .\nFurthermore, we discussed the link with existing families\nof LU invariants.\n\n(14)\n\n\u03a9\u2217\n(in fact, even |Tn,n\n(\u03c8 \u2032 )| > 0 is sufficient) and the information in all other invariants is in fact redundant. It\nis not unlikely that there exist smaller complete lists of\ninvariants (i.e. of smaller r) which exhibit less redundancies. Secondly, our work shows examples of LC equivalence classes which are indeed characterized by invariants\nof small r: e.g., any stabilizer state is LC equivalent to\nthe GHZ state on n qubits if and only if the values of\nthe invariants (11) coincide for both states [9]. We are\ntherefore led to believe that the results in theorems 1\nand 2 can in principle be improved - if not for all stabilizer states then at least for some interesting subclasses of\nstates. It is in this context interesting to point out that\nit has been conjectured and later disproved in a graph\ntheoretical context that the list of LC invariants (11) are\nsufficient to characterize the LC equivalence class of all\nstabilizer states [3, 14]. Therefore, invariants where r is\nat least 2 must be taken into account. It is to date not\nclear whether also higher r are to be considered.\nSummarizing this paper, we have characterized LC\nequivalence classes of stabilizer states by means of a finite\n\n[1] D.
