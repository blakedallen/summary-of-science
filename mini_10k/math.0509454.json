On the other hand, in most cases the values of such\ncharacteristics can just give certain bounds on the asymptotics of F rather than recover it\ncompletely.\nThe transformation F 7\u2192 log |F | puts this into the context of pluripotential theory, which\nleads to a question of characteristics of singularities of plurisubharmonic functions and their\nrelations to the asymptotic behaviour of the functions. Since our considerations are local, we\nassume the functions to be defined on domains of Cn , n > 1.\nLet u be a plurisubharmonic function near a point \u03b6 of Cn , such that u(\u03b6) = \u2212\u221e.\nThe value \u03bdu (\u03b6) of the Lelong number of u at \u03b6 gives some information on the asymptotic\n1\n\n\fbehaviour near \u03b6: u(x) \u2264 \u03bdu (\u03b6) log |x \u2212 \u03b6| + O(1). A more detailed information can be\nobtained by means of its directional Lelong numbers \u03bdu (\u03b6, a), a \u2208 Rn+ , due to Kiselman:\nu(x) \u2264 \u03bdu (\u03b6, a) maxk a\u22121\nk log |xk \u2212 \u03b6k | + O(1).\nIn addition, these characteristics of singularity are well suited for the tropical structure of\nthe cone of plurisubharmonic functions, namely \u03bdu+v = \u03bdu + \u03bdv (tropical multiplicativity) and\n\u03bdmax{u,v} = min{\u03bdu , \u03bdv } (tropical additivity). These properties play an important role, for\nexample, in investigation of valuations on germs of holomorphic functions [6]. Note that the\ntropical operations u \u2295 v := max{u, v} and u \u2297 v := u + v, when applied to plurisubharmonic\nsingularities, can be viewed as Maslov's dequantization of usual addition and multiplication\nof holomorphic functions.\nA general notion of Lelong numbers \u03bd(u, \u03c6) with respect to plurisubharmonic weights \u03c6\nwas introduced and studied by Demailly [3], [5]. Due to their flexibility, the Lelong\u2013Demailly\nnumbers have become a powerful tool in pluripotential theory and its applications. They\nstill are tropically multiplicative, however tropical additivity is no longer true for \u03bd(u, \u03c6)\nwith arbitrary plurisubharmonic weights \u03c6, even if they are maximal outside \u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e). In\naddition, the value \u03bd(u, \u03c6) gives little information on the asymptotics of u near \u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e).\nThe good properties of the classical and directional Lelong numbers result from the fact\nthat they can be evaluated by means of the suprema of u over the corresponding domains\n(the balls and polydiscs, respectively). This makes it reasonable to study the asymptotics of\nthe suprema of u over the corresponding domains {\u03c6(x) < t} for a maximal weight \u03c6 with\nan isolated singularity at \u03b6 and consider the value \u03c3(u, \u03c6) = lim inf u(x)/\u03c6(x) as x \u2192 \u03b6, the\ntype of u relative to \u03c6. The relative type is thus an alternative generalization of the notion\nof Lelong number.\nUnlike the Lelong\u2013Demailly numbers, the relative types need not be tropically multiplicative, however they are tropically additive. Moreover, they are the only \"reasonable\"\ntropically additive functionals on plurisubharmonic singularities (for a precise statement, see\nTheorem 4.3).\nMaximality of \u03c6 gives the bound u \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c6)\u03c6 + O(1) near the pole of \u03c6. We are then\ninterested in best possible bounds on u, given the values of its types relative to some of (or\nall) the weights \u03c6 with fixed \u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e). Tropical additivity of the relative types makes them\na perfect tool for dealing with upper envelopes of families of plurisubharmonic functions, constructing thus extremal plurisubharmonic functions with prescribed singularities. In certain\ncases these Green-like functions coincide with known variants of pluricomplex Green functions. In particular, this gives a new representation of the Green functions with divisorial\nsingularities (Theorems 6.6 and 6.7). We study relations between such extremal functions;\none of the relations implies a complete characterization of holomorphic mappings f with\nisolated zero at \u03b6 of the multiplicity equal to the Newton number of f at \u03b6 (Corollary 6.5).\n\n2\n\n\fWe also prove that the upperlevel sets for the types relative to exponentially H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous weights are analytic varieties (an analogue to the Siu theorem). As an application,\nwe obtain a result on propagation of plurisubharmonic singularities (Corollary 7.3) that\nresults in a new representation of the Green functions with singularities along complex spaces\n(Corollary 7.5).\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls basic facts on Lelong numbers and\nGreen functions. In Section 3 we present the definition and elementary properties of the relative types. A representation theorem for tropically additive functionals on plurisubharmonic\nsingularities is proved in Section 4. In Sections 5 and 6 we consider extremal problems for\nplurisubharmonic functions with given singularities. An analyticity theorem for the upperlevel sets and its applications are presented in Section 7.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nLelong numbers\n\nThe Lelong number \u03bdT (\u03b6) of a closed positive current T of bidimension (p, p) at a point \u03b6 \u2208 Cn\nis the residual mass of T \u2227 (ddc log | * \u2212\u03b6|)p at \u03b6:\nZ\n\u03bdT (\u03b6) = lim\nT \u2227 (ddc log |x \u2212 \u03b6|)p ;\n(2.1)\nr\u21920 |x\u2212\u03b6|<r\n\n \u0304 dc = (\u2202 \u2212 \u2202)/2\u03c0i.\n \u0304\nhere d = \u2202 + \u2202,\nThe Lelong number \u03bdu (\u03b6) of a plurisubharmonic function u is just the Lelong number of\nthe current ddc u. It can also be calculated as\nZ\n\u22121\n\u03bdu (\u03b6) = lim r\nu(\u03b6 + xer ) dS1 (x),\n(2.2)\nr\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nS1\n\nwhere dS1 is the normalized Lebesgue measure on the unit sphere S1 , as well as\n\u03bdu (\u03b6) = lim r \u22121 sup{u(x) : |x \u2212 \u03b6| < er } = lim inf\nr\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nz\u2192\u03b6\n\nu(z)\n,\nlog |z \u2212 \u03b6|\n\n(2.3)\n\nsee [7]. Since the function sup{u(x) : |x \u2212 \u03b6| < er } is convex in r, representation (2.3) implies\nthe bound u(x) \u2264 \u03bdu (\u03b6) log |x \u2212 \u03b6| + O(1) near \u03b6.\nLelong numbers are independent of the choice of coordinates. Siu's theorem states that\nthe set {\u03b6 : \u03bdT (\u03b6) \u2265 c} is analytic for any c > 0.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nDirectional Lelong numbers\n\nA more detailed information on the behaviour of u near \u03b6 can be obtained by means of the\ndirectional Lelong numbers due to Kiselman [8]: given a = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 Rn+ ,\n\u03bdu (\u03b6, a) = lim r \u22121 sup{u(x) : |xk \u2212 \u03b6k | < erak , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n},\nr\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\n(2.4)\n\nor equivalently, in terms of the mean values of u over the distinguished boundaries of the\npolydiscs, similarly to (2.2). Namely, u(x) \u2264 \u03bdu (\u03b6, a)\u03c6a,\u03b6 (x) + O(1) with\n\u03c6a,\u03b6 (x) = max a\u22121\nk log |xk \u2212 \u03b6k |.\nk\n\n(2.5)\n\nAnalyticity of the upperlevel sets {\u03b6 : \u03bdu (\u03b6, a) \u2265 c} was established in [8], [9].\nDirectional Lelong numbers give rise to the notion of local indicators of plurisubharmonic\nfunctions [13]. Given a plurisubharmonic function u, its (local) indicator at a point \u03b6 is\na plurisubharmonic function \u03a8u,\u03b6 in the unit polydisc Dn such that for any y \u2208 Dn with\ny1 * . . . * yn 6= 0,\n\u03a8u,\u03b6 (y) = \u2212\u03bdu (\u03b6, a),\n\na = \u2212(log |y1 |, . . . , log |yn |) \u2208 Rn+ .\n\n(2.6)\n\nIt is the largest nonpositive plurisubharmonic function in Dn whose directional Lelong numbers at 0 coincide with those of u at \u03b6, see the details in [13], [14].\n\n2.3\n\nLelong\u2013Demailly numbers\n\nA general notion of Lelong numbers with respect to plurisubharmonic weights was introduced\nand studied by J.-P. Demailly [3], [5]. Let T be a closed positive current of bidimension (p, p)\non a domain \u03a9 \u2282 Cn , and let \u03c6 be a continuous plurisubharmonic function \u03a9 \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e),\n\u03c6\nsemiexhaustive on the support of T , that is, BR\n\u2229 supp T \u22d0 \u03a9 for some real R, where\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n:= \u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e) 6= \u2205.

In the case\nof non-isolated singularities, a variant of Green functions was introduced by L\u00e1russon\u2013\nSigurdsson [11] by means of the class of negative plurisubharmonic functions u satisfying\n\u03bdu (x) \u2265 \u03b1(x), where \u03b1 is an arbitrary nonnegative function on D. In [12] it was specified to\nthe case when \u03b1(x) = \u03bdA (x) is the Lelong number of a divisor A; then\nFA,D = {u \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) : \u03bdu (x) \u2265 \u03bdA (x) \u2200x \u2208 D},\n\n(2.12)\n\nGA,D (x) = sup{u(x) : u \u2208 FA,D }\n\n(2.13)\n\nand\nis the Green function for the divisor A. It was shown that if A is the divisor of a bounded\nholomorphic function f in D, then GA,D = log |f | + O(1) near points of |A| = f \u22121 (0).\nThis was used in [16], [17] for consideration of Green functions with arbitrary analytic\nsingularities. Given a closed complex subspace A on D, let IA = IA,D = (IA,x )x\u2208D be\nthe associated coherent sheaf of ideals in the sheaf OD = (Ox )x\u2208D of germs of holomorphic\nfunctions on D, and let |A| = {x \u2208 D : IA,x 6= Ox }. A Green function GA,D for the complex\nspace A on D was constructed as\nGA,D (x) = sup {u(x) : u \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D), u \u2264 log |f | + O(1) locally near |A|},\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere f = (f1 , . . . , fp ) and f1 , . . . , fp are local generators of IA . The function GA,D is\nplurisubharmonic and satisfies\nGA,D \u2264 log |f | + O(1)\n(2.15)\nlocally near points of |A|; if IA has bounded global generators, then GA,D = log |f | + O(1).\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nDefinition and elementary properties of relative types\n\nGiven \u03b6 \u2208 Cn , let P SH\u03b6 stand for the collection of all (germs of) plurisubharmonic functions\nu 6\u2261 \u2212\u221e in a neighbourhood of \u03b6.\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 P SH\u03b6 be locally bounded outside \u03b6, \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u2212\u221e, and maximal in a punctured\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nneighbourhood of \u03b6: (ddc \u03c6)n = 0 on BR\n\\ {\u03b6} for some R > \u2212\u221e; we recall that BR\n= {z :\n\u03c6(z) < R}. The collection of all such maximal weights (centered at \u03b6) will be denoted by\nM W\u03b6 . If we want to specify that (ddc \u03c6)n = 0 on \u03c9 \\ {\u03b6}, we will write \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 (\u03c9).\nGiven a function u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 , its singularity at \u03b6 can be compared to that of \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 ;\nthe value\nu(z)\n(3.1)\n\u03c3(u, \u03c6) = lim inf\nz\u2192\u03b6 \u03c6(z)\nwill be called the \u03c6-type, or the relative type of u with respect to \u03c6.\nBoth the Lelong\u2013Demailly numbers and the relative types are generalizations of the classical notion of Lelong number, however they use different points of view on the Lelong number:\nwhile the Lelong\u2013Demailly numbers correspond to (2.1) (and (2.2) in the case of functions),\nthe relative types are based on (2.3). As we will see, the two generalizations have much in\ncommon, however some features are quite different.\nNote that \u03c3(u + h, \u03c6) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) if h is pluriharmonic (and hence bounded) near \u03b6, so\n\u03c3(u, \u03c6) is actually a function of ddc u.\nThe following properties are direct consequences of the definition of the relative type.\nProposition 3.1 Let \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 M W\u03b6 and u, uj \u2208 P SH\u03b6 .

For example, let u1 , u2 and \u03c6 be as in Remarks 3.2 (1), and let u = max {2u1 , u2 }.\nThen \u03c3(u, \u03c6) = 1/3, \u03bd(u, \u03c6) = 3 and \u03c4\u03c6 = 6, so the right hand side of (3.16) equals 1/2 > 1/3.\n\n10\n\n\f4\n\nRepresentation theorem\n\nIt was shown in Section 3 that relative types \u03c3(u, \u03c6) are positive homogeneous, tropically\nadditive (in the sense \u03c3(max uk , \u03c6) = min \u03c3(uk , \u03c6)) and upper semicontinuous functionals on\nP SH\u03b6 that preserve ordering of the singularities, i.e., u \u2264 v + O(1) implies \u03c3(u, \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(v, \u03c6).\nHere we show that any such functional on P SH\u03b6 can be represented as a relative type,\nprovided it does not vanish on a function that is locally bounded outside \u03b6.\nLemma 4.1 Let D be a bounded hyperconvex neighbourhood of a point \u03b6, and let a function\n\u03c3 : P SH \u2212 (D) \u2192 [0, \u221e] be such that \u03c3(u) < \u221e if u 6\u2261 \u2212\u221e and\n(i) \u03c3(cu) = c \u03c3(u) for all c > 0;\n(ii) if u1 \u2264 u2 + O(1) near \u03b6, then \u03c3(u1 ) \u2265 \u03c3(u2 );\n(iii) \u03c3(maxk uk ) = mink \u03c3(uk ), k = 1, 2;\n(iv) if uj \u2192 u in L1loc , then lim sup \u03c3(uj ) \u2264 \u03c3(u);\n(v) \u03c3(w0 ) > 0 for at least one w0 \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) \u2229 L\u221e\nloc (D \\ \u03b6).\nThen there exists a unique function \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 (D), \u03c6(z) \u2192 0 as z \u2192 \u2202D, such that\n\u03c3(u) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6)\n\n\u2200u \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D).\n\n(4.1)\n\nIf, in addition, (v) is true with w0 (z) = log |z \u2212 \u03b6| + O(1), then \u03c6 \u2208 LM W\u03b6 .\nProof. Denote \u03c6(z) = sup {u(z) : u \u2208 M}, where M = {u \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) : \u03c3(u) \u2265 1}.\nBy the Choquet lemma, there exists a sequence uj \u2208 M increasing to a function v such\nthat v \u2217 = \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D). Properties (iii) and (iv) imply v \u2217 \u2208 M, so v \u2217 \u2264 \u03c6. Therefore,\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2217 \u2208 M. Evidently, \u03c3(\u03c6) = 1.\nIf v \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) satisfies v \u2264 \u03c6 outside \u03c9 \u22d0 D \\ {\u03b6}, then v \u2208 M and so, v \u2264 \u03c6 in D.\nTherefore, the function \u03c6 is maximal on D \\ {\u03b6}. Furthermore, \u03c6 \u2208 L\u221e\nloc (D \\ {\u03b6}) because\n\u03c6 \u2265 w0 /\u03c3(w0 ). It is not hard to see that \u03c6(\u03b6) = \u2212\u221e. Indeed, assuming \u03c6(\u03b6) = A > \u2212\u221e,\nthe maximality of \u03c6 on {\u03c6(z) < A} gives \u03c6 \u2265 A everywhere, which contradicts \u03c3(\u03c6) > 0 in\nview of (ii). So, \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 (D).\nStandard arguments involving a negative exhaustion function of D show that \u03c6(z) \u2192 0\nas z \u2192 \u2202D.\nBy Proposition 3.4, u \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c6)\u03c6 + O(1) and thus, by (i) and (ii), \u03c3(u) \u2265 \u03c3(u, \u03c6) for\nevery u \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D). This gives, in particular, \u03c3(u, \u03c6) = 0 if \u03c3(u) = 0. Let \u03c3(u) > 0, then\nu/\u03c3(u) \u2208 M, so u \u2264 \u03c3(u)\u03c6 and consequently, \u03c3(u, \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(u). This proves (4.1).\n11\n\n\fIf \u03c8 is another weight from M W\u03b6 (D) with zero boundary values on \u2202D, representing the\nfunctional \u03c3, then \u03c8 \u2264 \u03c6. On the other hand, the relation \u03c3(\u03c6, \u03c8) = 1 implies that for any\n\u01eb \u2208 (0, 1) we have \u03c6 \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03c8 + \u01eb on a neighbourhood of \u03b6 and near \u2202D and thus, by the\nmaximality of \u03c8 on D \\ {\u03b6}, everywhere in D.\nFinally, the last assertion follows from the relation \u03c6 \u2265 w0 /\u03c3(w0 ) \u2208 LM W\u03b6 .\n\u0003\nRemarks 4.2 (1) Note that for the functional \u03c3(u) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) with a continuous weight\n\u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , the function \u03c6 constructed in the proof of Lemma 4.1 is just the Green\u2013Zahariuta\nfunction for the (continuous) singularity \u03c6 (2.9). We will keep this name for the case of Green\nfunctions with respect to arbitrary singularities \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 ,\nG\u03c6,D (z) = sup{u(z) \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) : u \u2264 \u03c6 + O(1) near \u03b6}.\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe have thus G\u03c6,D \u2208 M W\u03b6 (D), G\u03c6,D = \u03c6 + O(1) because \u03c3(G\u03c6,D , \u03c6) = 1, and G\u03c6,D (z) \u2192 0\nas z \u2192 \u2202D if D is hyperconvex.\n(2) Let \u0016 be a natural partial ordering on M W\u03b6 : \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c8 if \u03c3(u, \u03c6) \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c8) for any\nu \u2208 P SH\u03b6 . It is easy to see that \u03c6 \u0016 \u03c8 \u21d4 \u03c3(\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2265 1 \u21d4 G\u03c6,D \u2264 G\u03c8,D for some (and,\nconsequently, for any) hyperconvex neighbourhood D of \u03b6.\nThe following representation theorem is an easy consequence of Lemma 4.1.\nTheorem 4.3 Let a function \u03c3 : P SH\u03b6 \u2192 [0, \u221e) satisfy conditions [i)\u2013(v) of Lemma 4.1 for\nu, uk \u2208 P SH\u03b6 and D a bounded hyperconvex neighbourhood of \u03b6. Then there exists a weight\n\u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 such that \u03c3(u) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) for every u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 . The representation is essentially\nunique: if two weights \u03c6 and \u03c8 represent \u03c3, then \u03c6 = \u03c8 + O(1) near \u03b6. If, in addition, (v) is\ntrue with w0 (z) = log |z \u2212 \u03b6|, then \u03c6 \u2208 LM W\u03b6 .\nProof. We may assume \u03c3(w0 ) = 1. Let \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 be the function constructed in Lemma 4.1.\nExactly as in the proof of the lemma, we get \u03c3(u) \u2265 \u03c3(u, \u03c6) for every u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 . To prove\nthe reverse inequality, take any u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 . The function v0 = max {u, \u03c3(u)w0 } can be\nextended from a neighbourhood of \u03b6 to a plurisubharmonic function v on a neighbourhood\nof D; by (iii), \u03c3(u) = \u03c3(v0 ) = \u03c3(v \u2212 supD v) = \u03c3(v \u2212 supD v, \u03c6) = \u03c3(v0 , \u03c6) \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c6), so\n\u03c3(u) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6).\nIf \u03c8 \u2208 M W\u03b6 is another weight representing the functional \u03c3, then \u03c3(\u03c6, \u03c8) = \u03c3(\u03c8, \u03c6) = 1\nand \u03c8 = \u03c6 + O(1) by Proposition 3.4.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.4 Recall that a valuation on the local ring R\u03b6 of germs of analytic functions f\nat \u03b6 is a nonconstant function \u03bc : R\u03b6 \u2192 [0, +\u221e] such that\n\u03bc(f1 f2 ) = \u03bc(f1 ) + \u03bc(f2 ),\n\n\u03bc(f1 + f2 ) \u2265 min {\u03bc(f1 ), \u03bc(f2 )},\n12\n\n\u03bc(1) = 0;\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fa valuation \u03bc is centered if \u03bc(f ) > 0 for every f from the maximal ideal m\u03b6 , and normalized\nif min {\u03bc(f ) : f \u2208 m\u03b6 } = 1. Every weight \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 generates a functional \u03c3\u03c6 on R\u03b6 ,\n\u03c3\u03c6 (f ) = \u03c3(log |f |, \u03c6), with the properties\n\u03c3\u03c6 (f1 f2 ) \u2265 \u03c3\u03c6 (f1 ) + \u03c3\u03c6 (f2 ),\n\n\u03c3\u03c6 (f1 + f2 ) \u2265 min {\u03c3\u03c6 (f1 ), \u03c3\u03c6 (f2 )},\n\n\u03c3\u03c6 (1) = 0.\n\n(4.4)\n\nSuch a functional is thus a valuation if the weight \u03c6 satisfies the additional condition\n\u03c3(u + v, \u03c6) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) + \u03c3(v, \u03c6)\n\n(4.5)\n\nfor any u, v \u2208 P SH\u03b6 \u2013 in other words, if u 7\u2192 \u03c3(u, \u03c6) is tropically linear (both additive and\nmultiplicative); \u03c3\u03c6 is centered if and only if \u03c6 \u2208 LM W\u03b6 , and normalized iff \u03b1\u03c6 = 1.\nThe weights \u03c6a,\u03b6 (2.5) satisfy (4.5), and the corresponding functionals \u03c3\u03c6a,\u03b6 are monomial\nvaluations on R\u03b6 ; they are normalized, provided mink ak = 1. It was shown in [6] that an\nimportant class of valuations in C2 (quasimonomial valuations) can be realized as \u03c3\u03c6 with\ncertain weights \u03c6 \u2208 LM W\u03b6 satisfying (4.5) and \u03b1\u03c6 = 1, and all other normalized valuations\nin C2 can be realized as limits of increasing sequences of the quasimonomial ones. We believe\nthe relative types with respect to weights satisfying (4.5) can be used in investigation of\nvaluations in higher dimensions.\n\n5\n\nGreenifications\n\nIn this section we consider some extremal problems for plurisubharmonic functions with singularities determined by a given plurisubharmonic function u. Solutions to these problems\nresemble various Green functions mentioned in Section 2 (and in some cases just coincide with\nthem), and we will call them greenifications of the function u. This reflects the point of view\non Green functions as largest negative plurisubharmonic functions with given singularities;\ndifferent types of the Green functions arise from different ways of measuring the singularities (or different portions of information on the singularities used). Note that the tropical\nadditivity makes relative types an adequate tool in constructing extremal plurisubharmonic\nfunctions as upper envelopes.\n\n5.1\n\nType-greenifications\n\nLet a bounded domain D contain a point \u03b6 and let u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 . Given a collection P of\nweights \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , denote\nMPu = MPu,\u03b6,D = {v(x) : v \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D), \u03c3(v, \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(u, \u03c6)\n\n13\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 P }\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fand define the function\nhPu (x) = hPu,\u03b6,D (x) = sup {v(x) : v \u2208 MPu,\u03b6,D }.\n\n(5.2)\n\nWe will write simply Mu,\u03b6,D and hu,\u03b6,D if P = M W\u03b6 . The function hPu,\u03b6,D will be called\nthe type-greenification of u with respect to the collection P , and hu,\u03b6,D will be called just the\ntype-greenification of u at \u03b6.\nConsideration of the functions hPu with P 6= M W\u03b6 can be useful in situations where\nthe only information on the singularity of u available is the values of \u03c3(u, \u03c6) for certain\nselected weights \u03c6. One more reason is that for some collections P , the functions hPu are\nquite easy to compute and, at the same time, they can give a reasonably good information\non the asymptotic behaviour of u (see Examples 2 and 3 after Proposition 5.2). Note that\nhPu \u2265 hQ\nu \u2265 hu if P \u2282 Q \u2282 M W\u03b6 .\nProposition 5.1 Let u \u2208 P SH(D) be bounded above in D \u220b \u03b6, and P \u2286 M W\u03b6 . Then\n(i) hPu,\u03b6,D \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D);\n(ii) u \u2264 hPu,\u03b6,D + supD u;\n(iii) \u03c3(u, \u03c6) = \u03c3(hPu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6) for any weight \u03c6 \u2208 P ;\n(iv) hPu,\u03b6,D is maximal on D \\ {\u03b6};\n(v) if D has a strong plurisubharmonic barrier at a point z \u2208 \u2202D (i.e., if there exists\nv \u2208 P SH(D) such that limx\u2192z v(x) = 0 and supD\\U v < 0 for every neighbourhood U\nof z) and if u is bounded below near z, then hPu,\u03b6,D (x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 z.\nProof. Let w denote the right hand side of (5.2), then its upper regularization w\u2217 is plurisubharmonic in D. By the Choquet lemma, there exists a sequence vj \u2208 MPu such that\nw\u2217 = (supj vj )\u2217 . Denote wk = supj\u2264k vj . By Proposition 3.1(ii), wk \u2208 MPu . Since the functions wk converge weakly to w\u2217 , Proposition 3.5 implies then \u03c3(w\u2217 , \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(wk , \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(u, \u03c6)\nfor any weight \u03c6 \u2208 P and so, w\u2217 \u2208 MPu , which proves (i) and gives, at the same time, the\ninequality \u03c3(u, \u03c6) \u2264 \u03c3(hPu , \u03c6). The reverse inequality, even for arbitrary weights \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 ,\nfollows from the (evident) assertion (ii) and completes the proof of (iii).\nIf a function v \u2208 P SH(D) satisfies v \u2264 hPu,\u03b6,D on D \\ \u03c9 for some open set \u03c9 \u22d0 D \\ \u03b6, then\nmax {v, hPu,\u03b6,D } \u2208 MPu and therefore v \u2264 hPu,\u03b6,D on \u03c9, which proves (iv).\nFinally, to prove (v), take a neighbourhood U of z \u2208 \u2202D such that u > t > \u2212\u221e on U \u2229 D\nand choose c > 0 such that v < t/c on D \\ U , so u > cv on \u2202U \u2229 D. Let\n\u001a\nmax{u(x), cv(x)}, x \u2208 D \u2229 U\nw(x) =\n(5.3)\nu(x),\nx \u2208 D \\ U,\n14\n\n\fthen w \u2208 MPu,\u03b6,D (u) and limx\u2192z w(x) = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nIf v \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D), then the relation \u03c3(v, \u03c6) \u2265 \u03c3(u, \u03c6) is equivalent to v \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c6)G\u03c6,D .\nTherefore, these Green-like functions hPu,\u03b6,D can be described by means of the Green\u2013Zahariuta\nfunctions G\u03c6,D (4.2) as follows.\nProposition 5.2 The function hPu,\u03b6,D , P \u2282 M W\u03b6 , is the largest plurisubharmonic minorant\nof the family {\u03c3(u, \u03c6)G\u03c6,D : \u03c6 \u2208 P }. In particular, if \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , then h\u03c6,\u03b6,D = h\u03c6\n\u03c6,\u03b6,D = G\u03c6,D .\nExamples 5.3 (1) If P consists of a single weight \u03c6, then hPu,\u03b6,D = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) G\u03c6,D . In particular, if \u03c6(x) = log |x \u2212 \u03b6|, then hPu,\u03b6,D = \u03bdu (\u03b6) G\u03b6,D .\n(2) Let A be a finite subset of Rn+ and let P be the collection of the weights \u03c6a = \u03c6a,0\n(2.5) with a \u2208 A. According to Proposition 5.2 and (2.4), the function hPu,0,D is the largest\nplurisubharmonic minorant of the family {\u03bdu (0, a)G\u03c6a ,D : a \u2208 A}. Using methods from [13]\nand [14], it can then be shown that the minorant is the Green\u2013Zahariuta function for the\nsingularity \u03c6u,A (x) = \u03c8u,A (log |x1 |, . . . , log |xn |), where\n\u03c8u,A (t) = sup {hb, ti : b \u2208 Hu,A },\nHu,A =\n\n\\\n\n{b \u2208 Rn+ :\n\na\u2208A\n\nt \u2208 Rn\u2212 ,\n\nX bk\n\u2265 \u03bdu (0, a)}.\nak\n\n(5.4)\n\nk\n\nThus, if the only information on u is that it is locally bounded on D \\ {0} and the values\n\u03bdu (0, a) for a \u2208 A, then its residual Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re mass at 0 can be estimated as\n(ddc u)n (0) \u2265 (ddc hPu,0,D )n (0) = (ddc \u03c6u,A )n (0) = n! V ol(Hu,A ).\n\n(5.5)\n\n(3) If P consists of all the directional weights \u03c6a,\u03b6 (2.5), then hPu,\u03b6,D = G\u03a8,\u03b6,D , the Green\nfunction (2.10) with respect to the indicator \u03a8 = \u03a8u,\u03b6 (2.6) of the function u at \u03b6.\n(4) Let u = log |z1 | in the unit polydisc Dn and let P be the collection of the weights\n\u03c6a,0 (2.5) with a1 = 1. Then the type of u with respect to any \u03c6a,0 \u2208 P equals 1 and thus,\nv \u2264 \u03c6a,0 for every v \u2208 Mu,0,Dn and any such direction a. Therefore hPu,0,Dn = u. (For a more\ngeneral statement, see Theorem 6.6.)\nRemarks 5.4 (1) As follows from Example 4, the functions hPu,\u03b6,D need not be locally\nbounded outside \u03b6.\n(2) The same example shows that the condition of strong plurisubharmonic barrier cannot\nbe replaced by hyperconvexity in general. However this can be done if u \u2208 L\u221e\nloc (\u03a9 \\ {\u03b6}), see\nProposition 5.6.\n15\n\n\f5.2\n\nComplete greenifications\n\nAnother natural extremal function determined by the singularity of u can be defined as\nfollows. Let u \u2208 P SH(\u03a9) be such that u(\u03b6) = \u2212\u221e for some \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9. Given a domain D \u2282 \u03a9,\n\u03b6 \u2208 D, consider the class\nFu,\u03b6,D = {v \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) : v(z) \u2264 u(z) + O(1), z \u2192 \u03b6},\n\n(5.6)\n\nthen the upper regularization of its upper envelope is a plurisubharmonic function in D; we\nwill call it the complete greenification of u at \u03b6 and denote by gu,\u03b6,D :\ngu,\u03b6,D (x) = lim sup sup{v(y) : v \u2208 Fu,\u03b6,D }.\ny\u2192x\n\n(5.7)\n\nIf \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , then g\u03c6,\u03b6,D = G\u03c6,D , the Green\u2013Zahariuta function (4.2).\nIt follows from the definition that if u is bounded above on D, then\nu \u2264 gu,\u03b6,D + sup u.\n\n(5.8)\n\nD\n\nIt is easy to see that the function gu,\u03b6,D need not belong to the class Fu,\u03b6,D (take, for example,\nu = \u2212| log |z||1/2 , then gu,\u03b6,D \u2261 0).\nProposition 5.5 If a plurisubharmonic function u is bounded above on D \u220b \u03b6, then\n(i) gu,\u03b6,D is maximal on any open \u03c9 \u2282 D such that gu,\u03b6,D \u2208 L\u221e\nloc (\u03c9);\n(ii) \u03bd(u, \u03c6) = \u03bd(gu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6) for any continuous weight \u03c6 with \u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e) = \u03b6;\n(iii) \u03c3(u, \u03c6) = \u03c3(gu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6) for any \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 ;\n(iv) if D has a strong plurisubharmonic barrier at a point z \u2208 \u2202D and if u is bounded below\nnear z, then limx\u2192z gu,\u03b6,D (x) = 0.\nProof. Take a sequence of pseudoconvex domains Dj such that Dj+1 \u22d0 Dj \u22d0 D, \u2229j Dj = {\u03b6},\nand let\nuj (x) = sup{v(x) : v \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D), v \u2264 u \u2212 sup u in Dj }, x \u2208 D.\n(5.9)\nD\n\nu\u2217j\n\nP SH \u2212 (D)\n\nSince its upper regularization\nbelongs to\nand coincides with u \u2212 supD u in Dj ,\n\u2217\nthe function uj = uj \u2208 Fu,\u03b6,D and is maximal on D \\ Dj . When j \u2192 \u221e, the functions uj\nincrease to a function v such that v \u2217 \u2208 P SH \u2212 (D) and is maximal where it is locally bounded.\nEvidently, gu,\u03b6,D \u2265 v \u2217 .\n16\n\n\fBy the Choquet lemma, there exists a sequence wk \u2208 Fu,\u03b6,D that increases to w such that\nw\u2217 = gu,\u03b6,D . Take any \u01eb > 0, then for each k there exists j = j(k) such that wk \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)uj\non Dj . Therefore wk \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)uj \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)gu,\u03b6,D in D, which gives gu,\u03b6,D \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)v \u2217 for all\n\u01eb > 0 and thus, gu,\u03b6,D = v \u2217 , and (i) follows now from the maximality of v \u2217 .\nTo prove (ii), consider again the functions uj (5.9), then \u03bd(uj , \u03c6) = \u03bd(u, \u03c6) for any \u03c6. By\nTheorem 2.1,\n\u03bd(gu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6) \u2265 lim sup \u03bd(uj , \u03c6) = \u03bd(u, \u03c6),\n(5.10)\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nwhile the reverse inequality follows from (5.8) by Theorem 2.3.\nSimilar arguments (but now using Propositions 3.5 and 3.1 (v) instead of Theorems 2.1\nand 2.3) prove (iii). Finally, (iv) can be proved exactly as assertion (v) of Proposition 5.1. \u0003\nMore can be said if u is locally bounded outside \u03b6. Note that then it can be extended\n(from a neighbourhood of \u03b6) to a plurisubharmonic function in the whole space, and none of\nits greenifications at \u03b6 depend on the choice of the extension.\nProposition 5.6 If D is a bounded hyperconvex domain, u \u2208 P SH(D) \u2229 L\u221e\nloc (D \\ \u03b6), then\nlim gu,\u03b6,D (x) = 0,\n\nx\u2192z\n\nz \u2208 \u2202D,\n\n(ddc u)n (\u03b6) = (ddc gu,\u03b6,D )n (\u03b6).\n\n(5.11)\n\nProof. The first statement follows exactly as in the case of the pluricomplex Green function\nwith logarithmic singularity.\nTo prove (5.11), observe first that relation (5.8) implies (ddc u)n (\u03b6) \u2265 (ddc gu,\u03b6,D )n (\u03b6). On\nthe other hand, the functions uj (5.9) belong to the Cegrell class F [1] and increase a.e.\nto gu,\u03b6,D . By Theorem 5.4 of [1], (ddc uj )n \u2192 (ddc gu,\u03b6,D )n . Therefore, (ddc gu,\u03b6,D )n (\u03b6) \u2265\nlim supj\u2192\u221e (ddc uj )n (\u03b6) = (ddc u)n (\u03b6), which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.7 In spite of the relations in Proposition 5.5 and (5.11), some important information on the singularity can be lost when passing to the function gu,\u03b6,D . For example, if we\n1\ntake u(z) = max{log |z1 |, \u2212| log |z2 || 2 }, then gu,0,D = 0 for any D \u2282 C2 containing 0, while\n\u03bd(u, log |z2 |) = 1 (note that the function log |z2 | is semiexhaustive on the support of ddc u).\n\n6\n\nGreenifications and Green functions\n\nNow we turn to relations between the extremal functions considered above. We will write\nL\nMSu,\u03b6,D and hSu,\u03b6,D if P = SM W\u03b6 (3.12), and ML\nu,\u03b6,D and hu,\u03b6,D if P = LM W\u03b6 (3.13); in\nS\nL\nview of (3.14), hu,\u03b6,D \u2265 hu,\u03b6,D .\n17\n\n\fAccording to Proposition 5.5, we have \u03c3(gu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6) for all \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , so\ngu,\u03b6,D \u2264 hu,\u03b6,D \u2264 hPu,\u03b6,D\n\n(6.1)\n\nfor any u \u2208 P SH(D) and P \u2282 M W\u03b6 .\nBy Proposition 5.2, the condition gu,\u03b6,D \u2261 0 implies hPu,\u03b6,D \u2261 0 for every P \u2286 M W\u03b6 . So\nlet us assume gu,\u03b6,D 6\u2261 0.\nWhen \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , the function g\u03c6,\u03b6,D is the Green\u2013Zahariuta function for the singularity\n\u03c6 in D; by Proposition 5.2, the same is true for h\u03c6,\u03b6,D , so g\u03c6,\u03b6,D = h\u03c6,\u03b6,D . More generally,\nwe have the following simple\nProposition 6.1 Let u \u2208 P SH\u03b6 be locally bounded outside \u03b6, then gu,\u03b6,D = hu,\u03b6,D . If, in\naddition, \u03bdu (\u03b6) > 0, then gu,\u03b6,D = hSu,\u03b6,D .\nProof. The equalities result from Proposition 5.2 and (5.8) because gu,\u03b6,D belongs to M W\u03b6\nand, in case of \u03bdu (\u03b6) > 0, to SM W\u03b6 .\n\u0003\nRemark 6.2 We do not know if gu,\u03b6,D = hSu,\u03b6,D when \u03bdu (\u03b6) = 0. The condition \u03bdu (\u03b6) = 0\nimplies, by (3.15), hSu,\u03b6,D \u2261 0. As follows from Theorem 6.4 below, for functions u locally\nbounded outside \u03b6 the relation gu,\u03b6,D = hSu,\u03b6,D is thus equivalent to (ddc u)n (\u03b6) = 0, and we are\nfacing the problem of existence of plurisubharmonic functions with zero Lelong number and\npositive Monge-Amp\u00e8re mass. It can be reformulated as follows: is it true that gu,\u03b6,D \u2261 0 if\nu is locally bounded outside \u03b6 and \u03bdu (\u03b6) = 0? Equivalently: is it true that SM W\u03b6 = M W\u03b6 ?\nTo study the situation with the type-greenifications with respect to arbitrary subsets P\nof M W\u03b6 , we need the following result on \"incommensurability\" of Green functions.\nLemma 6.3 Let D be a bounded hyperconvex domain and let v, w \u2208 P SH(D) \u2229 L\u221e\nloc (D \\ \u03b6)\nbe two solutions of the Dirichlet problem (ddc u)n = \u03c4 \u03b4\u03b6 , u|\u2202D = 0 with some \u03c4 > 0. If v \u2265 w\nin D, then v \u2261 w.\nProof. We use an idea from the proof of Theorem 3.3 in [21]. Choose R > 0 such that\n\u03c1(x) = |x|2 \u2212 R2 < 0 in D. Given \u01eb > 0, consider the function u\u01eb = max{v + \u01eb\u03c1, w}. Since\nu\u01eb = w near \u2202D, we have\nZ\nZ\n(ddc w)n = \u03c4.\n\n(ddc u\u01eb )n =\n\nD\n\n(6.2)\n\nD\n\nOn the other hand, u\u01eb \u2264 v and thus, by Theorem 2.3,\n(ddc u\u01eb )n (\u03b6) \u2265 (ddc v)n (\u03b6) = \u03c4.\n18\n\n(6.3)\n\n\fTherefore (6.2) implies (ddc u\u01eb )n = 0 on D \\ {\u03b6}. The functions v + \u01eb\u03c1 and w are locally\nbounded outside \u03b6, so\n(ddc u\u01eb )n \u2265 \u03c71 (ddc (v + \u01eb\u03c1))n + \u03c72 (ddc w)n\n\n(6.4)\n\non D \\ {\u03b6} ([4], Proposition 11.9), where \u03c71 and \u03c72 are the characteristic functions of the\nsets E1 = {w \u2264 v + \u01eb\u03c1} \\ {\u03b6} and E2 = {w > v + \u01eb\u03c1} \\ {\u03b6}, respectively. This gives\nZ\n\u01ebn\n(ddc \u03c1)n \u2264 \u03c71 (ddc (v + \u01eb\u03c1))n = 0.\n(6.5)\nE1\n\nHence, the set {w < v} has zero Lebesgue measure, which proves the claim.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 6.4 Let D be bounded and hyperconvex, u \u2208 P SH(D) \u2229 L\u221e\nloc (D \\ \u03b6), and let\nP \u2286 M W\u03b6 . Then gu,\u03b6,D = hPu,\u03b6,D if and only if\n(ddc u)n (\u03b6) = (ddc hPu,\u03b6,D )n (\u03b6).\n\n(6.6)\n\nProof. If hPu,\u03b6,D = gu,\u03b6,D , then (6.6) follows from Proposition 5.6. The reverse implication\nfollows from Lemma 6.3 (by Proposition 5.6 and (6.1), the functions v = hPu,\u03b6,D and w = gu,\u03b6,D\nsatisfy the conditions of the lemma).\n\u0003\nThis can be applied to evaluation of the multiplicity of an equidimensional holomorphic\nmapping by means of its Newton polyhedron. Let \u03b6 be an isolated zero of an equidimensional\nholomorphic mapping f . Denote by \u0393+ (f, \u03b6) the Newton polyhedron of f at \u03b6, i.e., the convex\nhull of the set E\u03b6 + Rn+ , where E\u03b6 \u2282 Zn+ is the collection of the exponents in the Taylor\nexpansions of the components of f about \u03b6, and let N\u03b6 denote the Newton number of f at\n\u03b6, i.e., N\u03b6 = n! Vol(Rn+ \\ \u0393+ (f, \u03b6)). Kouchnirenko's theorem [10] states that the multiplicity\nm\u03b6 of f at \u03b6 can be estimated from below by the Newton number,\nm\u03b6 \u2265 N\u03b6 ,\n\n(6.7)\n\nwith an equality under certain non-degeneracy conditions. An application of Theorem 6.4\ngives a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality to hold.\nAs was shown in [14] and [15], N\u03b6 = (ddc \u03a8u,\u03b6 )n (0), where \u03a8u,\u03b6 is the indicator (2.6) of the\nplurisubharmonic function u = log |f | at \u03b6. Let P consist of all the directional weights \u03c6a,\u03b6 ,\na \u2208 Rn+ , and let D be a ball around \u03b6. Then (see Example 3 after Proposition 5.2) the function\nhPu,\u03b6,D coincides with the Green function (2.10) with respect to the indicator \u03a8u,\u03b6 , which in\nturn equals the Green\u2013Zahariuta function G\u03c6,D (2.9) for the singularity \u03c6(x) = \u03a8u,\u03b6 (x \u2212 \u03b6).\nTherefore hPu,\u03b6,D = g\u03c6,\u03b6,D and\nN\u03b6 = (ddc hPu,\u03b6,D )n (\u03b6).\n(6.8)\n19\n\n\fSince m\u03b6 = (ddc u)n (\u03b6), the equality m\u03b6 = N\u03b6 is equivalent to (6.6) and thus, by Theorem 6.4,\nto gu,\u03b6,D = g\u03c6,\u03b6,D . Finally, as u, \u03c6 \u2208 M W\u03b6 , we have u = gu,\u03b6,D + O(1) and \u03c6 = g\u03c6,\u03b6,D + O(1)\nnear \u03b6, which gives u = \u03c6 + O(1). We have just proved the following\nCorollary 6.5 The multiplicity of an isolated zero \u03b6 of an equidimensional holomorphic\nmapping f equals its Newton number at \u03b6 if and only if log |f (x)| = \u03a8(x \u2212 \u03b6) + O(1) as\nx \u2192 \u03b6, where \u03a8 = \u03a8log |f |,\u03b6 is the indicator (2.6) of the function log |f | at \u03b6.\nThe situation with non-isolated singularities looks more complicated. Observe, for example, that hPu,\u03b6,D is maximal on the whole D \\ {\u03b6}, however we do not know if the same is true\nfor gu,\u03b6,D .\nWe can handle the situation in the case of analytic singularities. In this section, we\nprove the equality gu,\u03b6,D = hL\nu,\u03b6,D for u = log |f |, where f : D \u2192 C is a holomorphic\nL\nfunction; we recall that hu,\u03b6,D is the type-greenification with respect to the class LM W\u03b6\n(3.13). In this case, the greenifications coincide with the Green function GA,D (2.13) in the\nsense of L\u00e1russon\u2013Sigurdsson. Note that the function GA,D is defined as the upper envelope\nof functions u with \u03bdu (a) \u2265 \u03bdA (a) for all a \u2208 |A|. It turns out that one can consider only one\npoint (or finitely many ones) from |A|, but then an infinite set of weights should be used.\nThe case of mappings f : D \u2192 Cp , p > 1, will be considered in Section 7.\nTheorem 6.6 Let u = log |f |, where f is a holomorphic function on \u03a9. Given \u03b6 \u2208 f \u22121 (0),\nmk\n1\nsuch that aj are irreducible factors of f vanishing at \u03b6 and\nlet f = ab with a = am\n1 . . . ak\nb(\u03b6) 6= 0. Then for any hyperconvex domain D \u22d0 \u03a9 that contains \u03b6,\nhL\nu,\u03b6,D = gu,\u03b6,D = GA\u03b6 ,D ,\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere GA\u03b6 ,D is the Green function (2.13) for the divisor A\u03b6 of the function a. Moreover,\nthere exists a sequence P of continuous weights \u03c6j \u2208 LM W\u03b6 such that the Green\u2013Zahariuta\nfunctions G\u03c6j ,D decrease to hPu,\u03b6,D = GA\u03b6 ,D .\nProof. Let FA\u03b6 ,D be the class defined by (2.12) for A = A\u03b6 , then FA\u03b6 ,D \u2282 Fu,\u03b6,D \u2282 ML\nu,\u03b6,D ,\nso\n(6.10)\nGA\u03b6 ,D \u2264 gu,\u03b6,D \u2264 hL\nu,\u03b6,D .\nChoose a sequence of domains Dj such that Dj+1 \u22d0 Dj \u22d0 D, \u2229j Dj = {\u03b6}, and f a\u22121 does\nnot vanish in D1 , then the functions uj defined by (5.9) satisfy\nuj \u2264 log |a| + Cj\n\n20\n\nin Dj .\n\n(6.11)\n\n\fBy Siu's theorem, the set {x \u2208 D : \u03bd(uj , x) \u2265 ms } is analytic; by (6.11), it contains the\nsupport |As | of the divisor As of as . Therefore, \u03bd(uj , x) \u2265 \u03bd(log |a|, x) for all x \u2208 |A\u03b6 |. Since\nuj converge to gu,\u03b6,D , this implies \u03bd(gu,\u03b6,D , x) \u2265 \u03bd(log |a|, x) and thus, gu,\u03b6,D \u2208 FA\u03b6 ,D . This\nproves the second equality in (6.9).\nLet f2 , . . . , fn be holomorphic functions in a neighbourhood \u03c9 \u22d0 D of \u03b6 such that \u03b6 is the\nonly point of the zero set of the mapping (f1 , . . . , fn ) in \u03c9 and \u03a90 = {z \u2208 \u03c9 : |fk | < 1, 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 n} \u22d0 \u03c9, where f1 = 2a(sup\u03c9 |a|)\u22121 . Denote\n\u03c6j := sup{log |f1 |, j log |fk | : 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n},\n\nj \u2208 Z+ .\n\n(6.12)\n\nWe have \u03c6j \u2208 LM W\u03b6 (\u03a90 ) and \u03c6j = 0 on \u2202\u03a90 , so \u03c6j = G\u03c6j ,\u03a90 , the Green\u2013Zahariuta function\nL\nfor the singularity \u03c6j in \u03a90 . Since hL\nu,\u03b6,D < 0 in \u03a90 and \u03c3(hu,\u03b6,D , \u03c6j ) = \u03c3(u, \u03c6j ) = 1, we have\nL\nhL\nu,\u03b6,D \u2264 \u03c6j in \u03a90 for each j. Therefore hu,\u03b6,D \u2264 log |f1 | = limj\u2192\u221e \u03c6j in \u03a90 . This implies\nL\nhL\nu,\u03b6,D \u2208 Fu,\u03b6,D and thus, hu,\u03b6,D = gu,\u03b6,D .\nFinally, the Green\u2013Zahariuta functions G\u03c6j ,D dominate hL\nu,\u03b6,D and decrease to some func\u2212\ntion v \u2208 P SH (D). Since \u03c3(v, \u03c6k ) \u2265 lim supj\u2192\u221e \u03c3(\u03c6j , \u03c6k ) = 1, we get v \u2264 hL\nu,\u03b6,D , which\ncompletes the proof.\n\u0003\nOne can also consider the greenifications with respect to arbitrary finite sets Z \u2282 D,\nP (\u03b6)\n\nhPu,Z,D (x) = sup {v(x) : v \u2208 Mu,\u03b6,D , \u03b6 \u2208 Z}\n\n(6.13)\n\ngu,Z,D (x) = lim sup sup{v(y) : v \u2208 Fu,\u03b6,D , \u03b6 \u2208 Z}.\n\n(6.14)\n\nand\ny\u2192x\n\nThey have properties similar to those of the functions hPu,\u03b6,D and gu,\u03b6,D , stated in Propositions 5.1\u20135.6 (with obvious modifications). In particular, if \u03c6 \u2208 P SH(D) is such that\n\u03c6\u22121 (\u2212\u221e) = Z and the restriction of \u03c6 to a neighbourhood of \u03b6 belongs to M W\u03b6 for each\n\u03b6 \u2208 Z, then h\u03c6,Z,D = g\u03c6,Z,D = G\u03c6,D , the Green\u2013Zahariuta function with the singularities\ndefined by \u03c6.

We consider a continuous plurisubharmonic function \u03c6 : \u03a9\u00d7\u03a9 \u2192 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e)\nsuch that:\n21\n\n\f(i) \u03c6(x, \u03b6) < R(\u03b6) on \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9;\n(ii) {x : \u03c6(x, \u03b6) = \u2212\u221e} = {\u03b6};\n(iii) for any \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9 and r < R(\u03b6) there exists a neighbourhood U of \u03b6 such that the set\n{(x, y) : \u03c6(x, y) < r, y \u2208 U } \u22d0 \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9;\n(iv) (ddc \u03c6)n = 0 on {\u03c6(x, \u03b6) > \u2212\u221e};\n(v) e\u03c6(x,\u03b6) is H\u00f6lder continuous in \u03b6:\n\u2203\u03b2 > 0 : |e\u03c6(x,\u03b6) \u2212 e\u03c6(x,y) | \u2264 |\u03b6 \u2212 y|\u03b2 ,\n\nx, y, \u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9.\n\n(7.1)\n\nIt then follows that \u03c6\u03b6 (x) := \u03c6(x, \u03b6) \u2208 SM W\u03b6 (3.12). Similarly to (3.3) and (3.1) we\nintroduce the function \u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , r) and the relative type \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ). By Theorem 6.8 of [2],\n\u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , r) is plurisubharmonic on each connected component of the set {\u03b6 : R(\u03b6) > r}.\nAs was shown (in a more general setting) by Demailly [3], the sets {\u03b6 : \u03bd(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ) \u2265 c}\nare analytic for all c > 0. By an adaptation of Kiselman's and Demailly's proofs of Siu's\ntheorem, we prove its analogue for the relative types. Denote\nSc (u, \u03c6, \u03a9) = {\u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ) \u2265 c},\n\nc > 0.\n\n(7.2)\n\nTheorem 7.1 Let \u03a9 be a pseudoconvex domain in Cn , a function \u03c6(x, \u03b6) satisfy the above\nconditions (i)\u2013(v), and u \u2208 P SH(\u03a9). Then Sc (u, \u03c6, \u03a9) is an analytic subset of \u03a9 for each\nc > 0.\nProof. By Theorem 6.11 of [2], the function U (\u03b6, \u03be) = \u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , Re \u03be) is plurisubharmonic\nin {(\u03b6, \u03be) \u2208 \u03a9 \u00d7 C : Re \u03be < R(\u03b6)}. Fix a pseudoconvex domain D \u22d0 \u03a9 and denote R0 =\ninf {R(\u03b6) : \u03b6 \u2208 D} > \u2212\u221e. Given a > 0, the function U (\u03b6, \u03be)\u2212a Re \u03be is then plurisubharmonic\nand independent of Im \u03be, so by Kiselman's minimum principle [7], the function\nUa (\u03b6) = inf{\u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , r) \u2212 ar : r < R0 }\n\n(7.3)\n\nis plurisubharmonic in D.\nLet \u03b6 \u2208 D. If a > \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ), then \u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , r) > ar for all r \u2264 r0 < min {R0 , 0}. If\nr0 < r < R0 , then \u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , r) \u2212 ar > \u039b(u, \u03c6y , r0 ) \u2212 aR0 . Therefore Ua (\u03b6) > \u2212\u221e.\nNow let a < \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ). H\u00f6lder continuity (7.1) implies\n\u039b(u, \u03c6y , r) \u2264 \u039b(u, \u03c6\u03b6 , log(er + |y \u2212 \u03b6|\u03b2 )) \u2264 \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ) log(er + |y \u2212 \u03b6|\u03b2 ) + C\n\n22\n\n(7.4)\n\n\fin a neighbourhood of \u03b6. Denote ry = \u03b2 log |y \u2212 \u03b6|, then\nUa (y) \u2264 \u039b(u, \u03c6y , ry ) \u2212 ary \u2264 (\u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ) \u2212 a)\u03b2 log |y \u2212 \u03b6| + C1\n\n(7.5)\n\nnear \u03b6.\nFinally, let Za,b (a, b > 0) be the set of points \u03b6 \u2208 D such that exp(\u2212b\u22121 Ua ) is not\nintegrable in a neighbourhood of \u03b6. As follows from the H\u00f6rmander\u2013Bombieri\u2013Skoda theorem,\nthe sets Za,b are analytic.\nIf \u03b6 6\u2208 Sc (u, \u03c6, \u03a9), then the function b\u22121 Ua with \u03c3(u, \u03c6\u03b6 ) < a < c is finite at \u03b6 and so, by\nSkoda's theorem, \u03b6 6\u2208 Za,b for all b > 0. If \u03b6 \u2208 Sc (u, \u03c6, \u03a9), a < c, and b < (c \u2212 a)\u03b2(2n)\u22121 ,\nthen (7.5) implies \u03b6 \u2208 Za,b . Thus, Sc (u, \u03c6, \u03a9) coincides with the intersection of all the sets\nZa,b with a < c and b < (c \u2212 a)\u03b2(2n)\u22121 , and is therefore analytic.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.2 The result can be reformulated in the following way: under the conditions of\nTheorem 7.1, the set S(u, \u03c6, \u03a9) = {\u03b6 \u2208 \u03a9 : u(x) \u2264 \u03c6(x, \u03b6) + O(1) as x \u2192 \u03b6} is analytic.\nAs was noticed by the referee, condition (iv) is actually necessary. Take, for example, the\nfunction \u03c6(x, \u03b6) = max{log |x1 \u2212 \u03b61 | + log |(x1 \u2212 \u03b61 )x2 |, log |x2 \u2212 \u03b62 |} in C2 \u00d7 C2 ; it has all the\nproperties except for (iv), while the set S(log |x1 |, \u03c6, C2 ) = {(0, \u03b62 ) : \u03b62 6= 0} is not analytic.\nAs an application, we present the following result on propagation of plurisubharmonic\nsingularities. We will say that a closed complex space A is a locally complete intersection\nif |A| is of pure codimension p and the associated ideal sheaf IA is locally generated by p\nholomorphic functions.\nCorollary 7.3 Let a closed complex space A be locally complete intersection on a domain\nD \u2282 Cn , and let \u03c9 be an open subset of D that intersects each irreducible component of |A|.\nIf a function u \u2208 P SH(D) satisfies u \u2264 log |f | + O(1) locally in \u03c9, where f1 , . . . , fp are local\ngenerators of IA , then it satisfies this relation near every point of |A|.\nProof. Denote by Zl , l = 1, 2, . . ., the irreducible components of |A|, and\n[\nZk .\nZl\u2217 = (Reg Zl ) \\\n\n(7.6)\n\nk6=l\n\nEvery point z \u2208 Zl\u2217 has a neighbourhood V and coordinates x = (x\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 ) \u2208 Cp \u00d7 Cn\u2212p ,\ncentered at z, such that V \u2229 |A| = V \u2229 Zl\u2217 = V \u2229 {x\u2032 = 0} and f1 , . . . , fp are global generators\nof IA on V . Let U \u22d0 D be a pseudoconvex neighbourhood of z such that U \u2212 U \u2282 V . For\nany \u03b6 \u2208 U and N > 0, the function\n\u03c6N (x, \u03b6) = max {log |f (x \u2212 (\u03b6 \u2032 , 0))|, N log |x\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 |}\n23\n\n(7.7)\n\n\fsatisfies the conditions of Theorem 7.1 with \u03a9 = U . Therefore, S1 (u, \u03c6N , U ) is an analytic\nsubset of U . Note that S1 (log |f |, \u03c6N , U ) = U \u2229 |A|.\nLet {U j } be a denumerable covering of Zl\u2217 by such neighbourhoods, and let {\u03c6j,N } be the\ncorresponding weights. We may assume u \u2264 log |f | + O(1) near a point \u03b60 \u2208 U 1 \u2229 \u03c9 \u2229 |A|, so\n1,N\n1\n1\n\u03c3(u, \u03c61,N\n\u03b6 ) \u2265 \u03c3(log |f |, \u03c6\u03b6 ) = 1 for every \u03b6 \u2208 U \u2229 \u03c9 \u2229 |A| and thus for every \u03b6 \u2208 U \u2229 |A|.\nTake any \u03b6 \u2208 U 1 \u2229 Zl\u2217 and choose constants a, b > 0 such that\nV\u03b6 = {x \u2208 U 1 : a|f (x)| < 1, b|x\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 | < 1} \u22d0 U 1 .\n\n(7.8)\n\nj,N + C in V , where\nAssuming u \u2264 C in U 1 , the relation \u03c3(u, \u03c6j,N\n\u03b6\n\u03b6 ) \u2265 1 implies u \u2264 g\n\ngj,N (x) = max {log |af (x)|, N log b|x\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2032\u2032 |}\n\n(7.9)\n\nj,N decrease to\nis the Green\u2013Zahariuta function in V\u03b6 for the singularity \u03c6j,N\n\u03b6 . Observe that g\nlog |af | as N \u2192 \u221e, so u \u2264 log |f | + C1 near \u03b6. Therefore we have extended the hypothesis of\nthe theorem from \u03c9 to \u03c9 \u222a U 1 . By repeating the argument, we get u \u2264 log |f | + O(1) near\nevery point of Zl\u2217 (since it is connected) and so, of Reg |A|. Finally, the bound near irregular\npoints of |A| can be deduced by using Thie's theorem and the equation (ddc log |f |)p = 0\noutside |A| (see, for example, the proof of Lemma 4.2 in [17]).\n\u0003\n\nRemarks 7.4 (1) In particular, if F is a holomorphic function in D whose restriction to \u03c9\nbelongs to the integral closure \u012aA,\u03c9 of the ideal sheaf IA,\u03c9 on \u03c9, then F \u2208 \u012aA,D . This follows\nfrom Corollary 7.3 because F \u2208 \u012aA if and only if log |F | \u2264 log |f | + O(1).\n(2) Corollary 7.3 fails when the complete intersection assumption is removed. Take, for\nexample, f = (z12 , z1 z2 ) in C2 , then log |z1 | \u2264 log |f (z)| + O(1) near every point (0, \u03be) with\n\u03be 6= 0, but not near the origin.\nA consequence of Corollary 7.3 is the following analogue to Theorems 6.6 and 6.7 for the\nGreen functions (2.14) with singularities along complex spaces.\nCorollary 7.5 Let a closed complex space B be locally complete intersection on a pseudoconvex domain \u03a9 \u2282 Cn , and let A be the restriction of B to a hyperconvex domain D \u22d0 \u03a9.\nFurther, let F1 , . . . , Fm be global sections of IB generating IA , and u = log |F |. If a finite\nsubset Z of D is such that each irreducible component of |A| contains at least one point of\nZ, then\nhL\n(7.10)\nu,Z,D = gu,Z,D = GA,D ,\nwhere the functions hL\nu,Z,D and gu,Z,D are defined by (6.13) and (6.14), L denotes the collection of maximal weights with finite Lojasiewicz exponents (3.10) at the points of Z, and\nGA,D is the Green function (2.14) for the space A.\n24\n\n\fProof. We use the same arguments as in the proof of Theorems 6.6 and 6.7, the only difference\nbeing referring to Corollary 7.3 instead of Siu's theorem.\nBy (2.15), we have GA,D \u2264 gu,Z,D . Let Z = {\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6s }. For k = 1, . . . , s take a sequence\nof pseudoconvex domains Dk,j such that Dk,j+1 \u22d0 Dk,j \u22d0 D, \u2229j Dk,j = {\u03b6k }, and denote\nDj = \u222ak Dk,j . As in the proof of Proposition 5.5, the functions uj defined by (5.9) with\nsuch a choice of Dj are plurisubharmonic in D, the sequence increases to gu,Z,D a.e. in D,\nand uj \u2264 log |F | + Cj near each \u03b6k . Since log |F | = log |f | + O(1), where f1 , . . . , fp are local\ngenerators of IA , p = codim |A|, this gives, by Corollary 7.3, the relations uj \u2264 log |f | + O(1)\nlocally near |A| and thus, gu,Z,D \u2264 GA,D . This proves the second equality in (7.10).\nThe rest is proved as in Theorem 6.6.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement.
