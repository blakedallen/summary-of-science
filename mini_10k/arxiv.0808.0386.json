GURTAS\n\nAbstract. We discuss a connection between the lantern relation in mapping\nclass groups and the rational blowing down process for 4-manifolds. More precisely, if we change a positive relator in Dehn twist generators of the mapping\nclass group by using a lantern relation, the corresponding Lefschetz fibration\nchanges into its rational blowdown along a copy of the configuration C2 . We\nexhibit examples of such rational blowdowns of Lefschetz fibrations whose\nblowup is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the original fibration.\n\n1. Introduction\nLefschetz fibrations relate the topology of symplectic 4-manifolds to the combinatorics on positive relators in Dehn twist generators of mapping class groups.\nFuller introduced a substitution technique for constructing positive relators to obtain an example of non-holomorphic Lefschetz fibrations of genus three [15], [14].\nMany constructions of Lefschetz fibrations as positive relators can be interpreted\nas generalizations of his construction (cf. [5]), while it has been less investigated\nwhat such substitutions mean geometrically.\nIn this paper we study a particular substitution, the lantern substitution (or\nthe L\u00b11 -substitution in short), for positive relators of mapping class groups. The\ncorresponding surgical operation on Lefschetz fibrations turns out to be the rational\nblowing down process, which was discovered by Fintushel and Stern [6], along a copy\nof the configuration C2 (i.e. a \u22124-framed unknot in Kirby diagrams). Applying a\ntheorem of Usher [19], we give examples of such rational blowdowns of Lefschetz\nfibrations whose blowup is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the original\nfibration.\nIn Section 2 we review the lantern relation in mapping class groups and define\nthe lantern substitution for positive relators. We discuss a relation between lantern\nrelations and rational blowdowns in Section 3 and state the main theorem in Section\n4. We then exhibit some examples in Section 5 and end by observing other relations\nin Section 6.\nThe authors are grateful to K.

ENDO AND Y. Z. GURTAS\n\n2. Lantern relations and substitutions\nLet \u03a3g be a closed oriented surface of genus g (\u2265 2) and Mg the mapping class\ngroup of \u03a3g . We denote by F the free group generated by all isotopy classes S\nof simple closed curves on \u03a3g . There is a natural epimorphism \u031f : F \u2192 Mg\nwhich sends (the isotopy class of) a simple closed curve a on \u03a3g to the righthanded Dehn twist ta along a. We set R := Ker \u031f and call each element of\nR a relator in the generators S of Mg . A word in the generators S is called\npositive if it includes no negative exponents. We put W (c) := t\u03b5arr * * * t\u03b5a11 (c) \u2208 S\nfor c \u2208 S and W = a\u03b5rr * * * a\u03b511 \u2208 F (a1 , . . . , ar \u2208 S, \u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r \u2208 {\u00b11}), and put\nW V := W (c1 ) * * * W (cs ) \u2208 F for V = c1 * * * cs \u2208 F (c1 , . . . cs \u2208 S).\nWe begin with a precise definition of the lantern relation [2], [9].\nDefinition 2.1. Let a and b be simple closed curves on \u03a3g with geometric intersection number 2 and algebraic intersection number 0. We orient a and b locally\non a neighborhood of each intersection point p \u2208 a \u2229 b such that the intersection\nnumber (a * b)p at p is +1. Resolving all intersection points according to the local\norientations, we obtain a new simple closed curve c. A regular neighborhood of\na \u222a b, which can be chosen to include c, is a genus 0 subsurface \u03a3 of \u03a3g with four\nboundary components. We denote simple closed curves parallel to four boundary\ncomponents of \u03a3 by d1 , d2 , d3 , and d4 . The relation\ntd 1 td 2 td 3 td 4 = ta tb tc\n\u22121 \u22121\nis called the lantern relation. We put L := L(a, b) = abcd4\u22121 d\u22121\n3 d2 d1 \u2208 R.\n\nLet \u033a \u2208 R (\u033a 6= 1) be a positive relator of Mg . Let a, b, c, d1 , d2 , d3 , and d4\nbe curves as in Definition 2.1. Suppose that \u033a includes d1 d2 d3 d4 as a subword:\n\u033a = U * d1 d2 d3 d4 * V (U, V \u2208 F ). Since \u033a and U * L * U \u22121 are both relators of Mg ,\nthe positive word\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u033a\u2032 = U * abc * V (= U * abcd4\u22121 d\u22121\n3 d2 d1 * d1 d2 d3 d4 * V\n\n= U * L * U \u22121 * U * d1 d2 d3 d4 * V = U * L * U \u22121 * \u033a )\nis also a relator of Mg . The length of the word \u033a\u2032 is equal to that of \u033a minus one.\nDefinition 2.2. We say that \u033a\u2032 is obtained by applying an L-substitution to \u033a.\nConversely, \u033a is said to be obtained by applying an L\u22121 -substitution to \u033a\u2032 . We also\ncall these two kinds of operations lantern substitutions (cf. [5]).\nWe next recall a definition of Lefschetz fibrations (cf. [13], [8]).\nDefinition 2.3. Let M be a closed oriented smooth 4-manifold. A smooth map\nf : M \u2192 S 2 is called a Lefschetz fibration of genus g if it satisfies the following\nconditions:\n(i) f has finitely many critical values b1 , . . . , bn \u2208 S 2 and f is a smooth fiber\nbundle over S 2 \u2212 {b1 , . . . , bn } with fiber \u03a3g ;\n(ii) for each i (i = 1, . . . , n), there exists a unique critical point pi in the singular\nfiber f \u22121 (bi ) such that f is locally written as f (z1 , z2 ) = z12 +z22 with respect to some\nlocal complex coordinates around pi and bi which are compatible with orientations\nof M and S 2 ;\n(iii) no fiber contains a \u22121-sphere.\nRemark 2.4. A more general definition can be found in Chapter 8 of [8]. We treat\nalso Lefschetz fibrations with boundary in the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n\n\fLANTERN RELATIONS AND RATIONAL BLOWDOWNS\n\n3\n\nSuppose that g \u2265 2. According to theorems of Kas and Matsumoto, there exists a\none-to-one correspondence between the isomorphism classes of Lefschetz fibrations\nand the equivalence classes of positive relators modulo simultaneous conjugations\nc1 * * * * * cn \u223c W (c1 ) * * * * * W (cn ),\nand elementary transformations\nc1 * * * * * ci * ci+1 * * * * * cn \u223c c1 * * * * * ci+1 * c\u22121 (ci ) * * * * * cn ,\ni+1\n\nc1 * * * * * ci * ci+1 * * * * * cn \u223c c1 * * * * * ci (ci+1 ) * ci * * * * * cn ,\nwhere c1 * * * cn \u2208 R is a positive relator in the generator S and W \u2208 F . This\ncorrespondence is described by using the holonomy (or monodromy) homomorphism\ninduced by the classifying map of f restricted on S 2 \u2212 {b1 , . . . bn } (cf. [8], [13], and\n[3]). We denote (the isomorphism class of) a Lefschetz fibration associated to a\npositive relator \u033a \u2208 R by M\u033a \u2192 S 2 .\nLet \u033a, \u033a\u2032 \u2208 R be positive relators of Mg and M\u033a , M\u033a\u2032 the corresponding Lefschetz\nfibrations over S 2 , respectively. Suppose that the relator \u033a\u2032 is obtained by applying\nan L-substitution to the relator \u033a. The Euler characteristic and the signature of a\nLefschetz fibration M\u033a\u2032 \u2192 S 2 with monodromy \u033a\u2032 are computed as follows:\ne(M\u033a\u2032 ) = e(M\u033a ) \u2212 1,\n\n\u03c3(M\u033a\u2032 ) = \u03c3(M\u033a ) + 1\n\n([5], Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 3.12). We investigate relations between M\u033a and\nM\u033a\u2032 and several properties of them in the subsequent sections.\n3. Rational blowdowns via lantern relations\n\u2032\n\nLet \u033a, \u033a \u2208 R be positive relators of Mg and M\u033a , M\u033a\u2032 the corresponding Lefschetz\nfibrations over S 2 , respectively.\nTheorem 3.1. If \u033a\u2032 is obtained by applying an L-substitution to \u033a, then the 4manifold M\u033a\u2032 is a rational blowdown of M\u033a along a configuration C2 \u2282 M\u033a .\nProof. We take a subsurface \u03a3 of \u03a3g and curves a, b, c, d1 , d2 , d3 , and d4 on \u03a3 as in\nDefinition 2.1. Let N, N \u2032 be Lefschetz fibrations over D2 with fiber \u03a3 corresponding\nto the positive words d1 d2 d3 d4 , abc, respectively.\n\nFigure 1\nDrawing a Kirby diagram of N , sliding the central \u22121-framed unknot over other\nthree \u22121-framed unknots, and canceling three 1-handle/2-handle pairs, we obtain\na \u22124-framed unknot (Figure 1). Thus N is diffeomorphic to the total space of a\nD2 -bundle over S 2 with Euler number \u22124, which is denoted by C2 in [6] (see also\n[8], Section 8.5).\n\n\f4\n\nH. ENDO AND Y. Z. GURTAS\n\nFigure 2\nDrawing a Kirby diagram of N \u2032 and sliding and canceling handles as in Figure 2,\nwe obtain a pair of a dotted circle and a +1-framed unknot with linking number\n+2. This means that N \u2032 is diffeomorphic to a rational 4-ball with boundary L(4, 1),\nwhich is denoted by B2 in [6] (see also [8], Section 8.5).\nFrom construction, N (resp. N \u2032 ) can be considered a submanifold of M\u033a (resp.\nM\u033a\u2032 ). It is also easily seen that M\u033a \u2212 int N and M\u033a\u2032 \u2212 int N \u2032 are diffeomorphic to\neach other. Hence we have\nM\u033a\u2032 \u2248 N \u2032 \u222a\u2202N (M\u033a \u2212 int N ) \u2248 B2 \u222aL(4,1) (M\u033a \u2212 int C2 ).\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.1. \u0003\n4. Smooth structures\nLet \u033a, \u033a\u2032 \u2208 R be positive relators of Mg and M\u033a , M\u033a\u2032 the corresponding Lefschetz\nfibrations over S 2 , respectively. Suppose that \u033a\u2032 is obtained by applying k times Lsubstitutions (k \u2265 1), elementary transformations, and simultaneous conjugations\nto \u033a. Suppose also that e(M\u033a )+\u03c3(M\u033a ) \u2265 2. We choose a positive relator \u03c2 \u2208 R (\u03c2 6=\n1) such that M\u03c2 \u2212 \u03bdF is simply-connected and either the word \u03c2 includes at least\none separating curve as a factor, or \u03c3(M\u033a )+\u03c3(M\u03c2 ) is not divisible by 16. Here \u03bdF is\nan open fibered neighborhood of a regular fiber F of M\u03c2 . Taking a fiber sum of M\u033a\n(resp. M\u033a\u2032 ) with M\u03c2 , we obtain a new Lefschetz fibration M1 := M\u033a #F M\u03c2 (resp.\nM2 := M\u033a\u2032 #F M\u03c2 ) with monodromy \u033a * W \u03c2 (resp. \u033a\u2032 * W \u2032 \u03c2) for some W \u2208 F (resp.\nW \u2032 \u2208 F ). It is obvious that \u033a\u2032 * W \u2032 \u03c2 is obtained by applying k times L-substitutions,\nelementary transformations, and simultaneous conjugations to \u033a * W \u03c2.\nTheorem 4.1. The 4-manifold M1 is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a k\n2\ntimes blowup M2 #kCP of M2 . Moreover, both of these 4-manifolds do not dissolve.\nProof. Let j : Fi \u0592\u2192 Mi be the inclusion map from a general fiber Fi into the total\nspace Mi (i = 1, 2). The induced homomorphism j# : \u03c01 (Fi ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Mi ) is surjective\nand the kernel of j# includes the normal subgroup N of \u03c01 (Mi ) generated by the\nvanishing cycles of Mi (cf. [1], Lemma 3.2). Since M\u03c2 \u2212 \u03bdF is simply-connected\nand j# is the composition of homomorphisms \u03c01 (Fi ) \u2192 \u03c01 (M\u03c2 \u2212 \u03bdF ) \u2192 \u03c01 (Mi ),\nthe group \u03c01 (Mi ) must be trivial (i = 1, 2).\nM1 is a non-spin 4-manifold because either it has a component of a separating\nsingular fiber which represents a homology class of square \u22121, or \u03c3(M1 ) is not\ndivisible by 16. It is easily seen from the observation above that e(M2 ) = e(M1 ) \u2212 k\nand \u03c3(M2 ) = \u03c3(M1 ) + k. By virtue of Freedman's classification theorem, both of\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212\nM1 and M2 #kCP is homeomorphic to #b+\n2 (M1 )CP #b2 (M1 )CP because they\nare simply-connected, non-spin, and have the same Euler characteristic and the\nsame signature.\nM1 is a fiber sum M\u033a #F M\u03c2 of non-trivial Lefschetz fibrations M\u033a and M\u03c2 . By\nGompf's theorem ([8], Theorem 10.2.18), M1 admits a symplectic structure with\n\n\fLANTERN RELATIONS AND RATIONAL BLOWDOWNS\n\n5\n\nsymplectic fibers. It follows from a theorem of Usher [19] that M1 is a minimal\n+\n+\nsymplectic 4-manifold. Since b+\n2 (M1 ) = b2 (M\u033a ) \u2212 b1 (M\u033a ) + b2 (M\u03c2 ) + 2g \u2212 1 > 1,\nM1 does not contain any smooth \u22121-sphere as a consequence of Seiberg-Witten\n2\ntheory ([17], [18], cf. [8], Remark 10.2.4(a)). On the other hand, M2 #kCP has a\n2\nnatural smooth \u22121-sphere. Hence M1 and M2 #kCP can not be diffeomorphic.\n2\nBecause M1 and M2 #kCP admit symplectic structure and b+\n2 (M1 ) > 1, these\n2\n2\n\u2212\nmanifolds can not be diffeomorphic to #b+\n(M\n)CP\n#b\n(M\n)CP\n([16], [10], cf. [8],\n1\n1\n2\n2\nTheorem 10.1.14). \u0003\nRemark 4.2. We do not use any explicit property of rational blowdowns to prove\nTheorem 4.1. The proof above is rather similar to that of Theorem 4.8 of [3]. It\n2\nis likely that M\u033a is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to M\u033a\u2032 #kCP (without\ntaking fiber sums with M\u03c2 ) in a general setting. On the other hand, a certain\nrational blowdown along C2 happens to be diffeomorphic to an honest blowdown\n2\nof the original 4-manifold: E(1)2 (\u2248 E(1) \u2248 CP2 #9CP ) is a rational blowdown of\n2\n2\nE(1)#CP (\u2248 CP2 #10CP ) along C2 ([6], Proposition 3.2, cf. [8], Theorem 8.5.9\nand Theorem 8.3.11).\n5. Examples\nWe apply theorems in previous sections to explicit examples.\neven\neven\nExample 5.1. Let \u033a := F\u0304g\u2212h\u22121\nFh\u22121\nand \u033a\u2032 := Vh (2 \u2264 h \u2264 g \u2212 2) be the relators\nof Mg (g \u2265 4) constructed in Section 4 of [5] and \u03c2 := Q the positive relator of\nMg (g \u2265 2) constructed in Section 4 of [3]. Since \u033a\u2032 is obtained by applying an Lsubstitution to \u033a, it turns out from Theorem 3.1 that M\u033a\u2032 is a rational blowdown of\nM\u033a along a copy of C2 . The Euler characteristic and the signature of M\u033a\u2032 are equal\nto 12g 2 + 6g + 8gh \u2212 8h2 + 7 and \u22126g 2 \u2212 8g \u2212 4gh + 4h2 \u2212 3, respectively. M\u03c2 \u2212 \u03bdF is\nsimply-connected and \u03c2 includes one separating curve. The Euler characteristic and\nthe signature of M\u03c2 are 2g 2 + 7 and \u2212(g 2 + 2g + 3) for even g, and 2g 2 + 4g + 7 and\n\u2212(g + 2)2 for odd g, respectively. We set M1 := M\u033a #F M\u03c2 and M2 := M\u033a\u2032 #F M\u03c2 .\nIt follows from Theorem 4.1 that M1 is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to\n2\nM2 #CP and both of these do not dissolve. If we use Qn (n \u2265 2) instead of Q, we\nobtain infinitely many pairs of homeomorphic but non-diffeomorphic 4-manifolds\nfor a fixed g (\u2265 4).\n\nExample 5.2.

Since E is simply-connected\nand has the Euler characteristic 12 and signature \u22128, E is homeomorphic to E(1) =\n2\nCP2 #9CP from Freedman's classification theorem.\nProblem 5.4. Does E decompose into a non-trivial fiber sum of other Lefschetz\nfibrations? Is E isomorphic to a fiber sum of two copies of Matsumoto's fibration?\nIf E decomposes into a non-trivial fiber sum, then it is not diffeomorphic to\nE(1) by virtue of Usher's theorem [19]. Matsumoto's fibration (Example B of [13])\nis a Lefschetz fibration of genus 2 with 6 non-separating, 2 separating singular\n2\nfibers, and its total space is diffeomorphic to S 2 \u00d7 T 2 #4CP . It is easy to see\nthat an appropriately twisted fiber sum of two copies of Matsumoto's fibration is\nhomeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to E(1). Another possible way to examine\nthe manifold E would be to compute the Seiberg-Witten invariants of E by the\nformula [6] of Fintushel and Stern.\n6. Other relations\nWe finally observe effects of substitutions for other relations. Luo [11] improved\nGervais' infinite presentation [7] of Mg to show that the set R of relators is normally\ngenerated by all commutativity, all braid, all 2-chain, and all lantern relators. We\nbriefly review definitions of these relations but lantern relation.\n\n\fLANTERN RELATIONS AND RATIONAL BLOWDOWNS\n\n9\n\nLet a, b be disjoint essential simple closed curves on \u03a3g . The relation\nta tb = tb ta\nin Mg is called a commutativity relation. A regular neighborhood \u03a3 of a \u222a b is the\ndisjoint union of two annuli.\nLet a, b be simple closed curves on \u03a3g which intersect transversely at one point.\nThe relation\nta tb ta = tb ta tb\nin Mg is called a braid relation. A regular neighborhood \u03a3 of a \u222a b is a torus with\none boundary component. Let c be a simple closed curve parallel to the boundary\nof \u03a3. The relation\n(ta tb )6 = tc\nin Mg is called a chain relation of length 2, or 2-chain relation in short.\nBoth sides of each relation above correspond to Lefschetz fibrations over D2 with\nfiber \u03a3. It is not difficult to draw Kirby diagrams of those manifolds and find out\nwhat they are (cf. [8], Chapter 8). We actually obtain the following table.\nrelation\ncommutativity\nbraid\n2-chain\nlantern\n\nmanifold for LHS\nD4 \u2210 D4\nX(S 2 , \u22122)\nMc (2, 3, 6)\nC2\n\nmanifold for RHS\nD4 \u2210 D4\nX(S 2 , \u22122)\nX(T 2 , \u22121)\nB2\n\ncommon boundary\nS3 \u2210 S3\nRP3\n\u03a3(2, 3, 6)\nL(4, 1)\n\nThe symbol X(B, e) stands for the total space of a D2 -bundle over B with Euler\nnumber e.

Substitutions for commutativity and braid\nrelations do not change the original manifold (cf. [20], Figure 34 and [3], Appendix\nA), whereas those for 2-chain and lantern relations do.\nIt might be interesting to extend the table above to that for various other relations such as chain relations of length n (\u2265 3), the star relation, and Matsumoto's\nrelations [12]. No relation seems to be known to correspond to a rational blowing\ndown process along Cp for p \u2265 3.\nReferences\n[1] J. Amor\u00f3s, F. Bogomolov, L. Katzarkov, and T.
