The selection criteria and\nprocedure are given in detail. We present here an assortment of MERLIN and\nVLBI observations and make some general comments based on the morphologies\nof the sources presented.\n\nKeywords: surveys - radio continuum: general - quasars: general - galaxies:\nactive\n\n1\n\nSample Selection\n\nTo select weak compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources from the FIRST catalogue\n(White et al. 1997) we took the following steps:\na) From the source list based on Green Bank (GB) surveys at 21 and 6 cm (White\n& Becker 1992) we selected those lying within the limits of the very first release\nof the FIRST survey - it covered the area RA (J2000) = 6h 35m \u2212 17h 30m , dec\n(J2000) = 28\u25e6 \u2212 42\u25e6 at that time - having steep spectra (\u03b1 > 0.5, S \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 ) and\nbeing stronger than 150 mJy at 6 cm. This flux density limit was chosen in order\nto produce a sample of a manageable size. The above declination limits indicate\nthat the overlap between our sample and the B3\u2013VLA survey-based sample (Fanti\net al. 2001; Dallacasa et al. 2002a, 2002b) is not large.\nb) Thanks to a dramatic difference in the resolution, the majority of sources appearing as single in the GB survey turn out to be double or multiple on FIRST\nmaps. We rejected all such cases, i.e. we selected only those sources that are\nsingle entities in the FIRST catalogue, i.e. more compact than the FIRST beam\n(5.\u2032\u2032 4) and surrounded by an empty field. We adopted 1 arcmin as a radius of\n1\n\n\fthat field. Additionally we referred to NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) to check that,\nindeed, we picked up compact sources. Such a procedure allows us to make sure\nthat we deal with isolated objects and not parts of larger objects.\nc) We again checked whether our targets fulfill the spectrum steepness criterion:\ninstead of GB survey flux densities at 21 cm we used more accurate values from\nFIRST. We rejected candidates with flat spectra (\u03b1 \u2264 0.5).\nd) We rejected the GPS sources. For this purpose we identified our preliminary\ncandidates with objects listed in the 365 MHz Texas catalogue (Douglas et al.\n1996). We passed only those objects which have non-inverted spectra between\n365 and 1400 MHz. In other words the turnover frequencies of our sources lie\nbelow 365 MHz.\nFinally we selected 60 candidates for CSS sources.\n\n2\n\nThe Observations\n\nThe initial survey was performed with MERLIN at 5 GHz. Each of our targets was\nobserved six times in 10 minute scans spread evenly over a 12 hour track. Phase\ncalibrators from the MERLIN Calibrator List were observed twice per target scan for\n1\u20132 minutes.\nSix objects having sizes similar to classical CSS sources, yet being less luminous,\nwere followed up with MERLIN at 1.6 GHz - see Kunert et al. (2002).\nTwelve targets have either been misdetected or unresolved. The latter group of nine\nobjects have just been followed up with the global VLBI. If it turns out that there are\ncompact symmetric objects (CSOs) among them, this will be a very interesting result.\nNormally CSOs are GPS sources but our sources are not GPS by definition so they\ncould be interpreted as 'dying CSOs'. We comment on this group in Marecki, Spencer,\n& Kunert (2003, hereafter Paper II).\nThe whole set of MERLIN images is presented by A. Marecki et al. (in preparation).\nTwenty objects have been selected for higher resolution observations. Each of them\nwas observed with the VLBA at 18 cm and the EVN at 6 cm. Comprehensive results\nof those VLBI campaigns will be presented elsewhere. Here we draw some general\nconclusions based on the whole observational material and illustrate them with a small\nsubset of images.\n\n3\n\nSome General Conclusions\n1. Since our research was carried out at two frequencies and with three different interferometric arrays it enabled us to see our targets in several frequency/resolution\ncombinations. As a result we were able to locate cores in many objects and it\nappears that one-sided structures are not under-represented in our sample compared to other samples. In other words, it does not seem that CSS sources in\n2\n\n\fdeep samples like ours are predominantly symmetric objects. A single network,\nsingle frequency map can be very easily misinterpreted as an image of a symmetric object. The quasar 1148+387 is a good example of such a deceiving object:\nit appears as a compact (0.\u2032\u2032 2 separation of the components) and very symmetric\ndouble on the 6 cm MERLIN map but it is actually an asymmetric object according to our dual frequency VLBI surveys - the southern component has a\nflat spectrum so it must be a core (Figure 1). 1343+386 (also a quasar), which\nwas observed in parallel at 18 cm with the VLBA by Dallacasa et al. (2002a),\nis a similar case (Figure 2). According to our measurements, the component\nDallacasa et al. (2002a) denoted as N1 is the strongest one and features a flat\nspectrum.\n2. As in the case of other samples of CSS sources those which happen to be mediumsized symmetric objects (MSOs) are FR II-like - 1709+303 is a classical specimen\n- and it is very hard to find a mini-FR I; in our sample only 1601+382 resembles\nan FR I (Figure 3). We further comment on this fact in Paper II.\n3. A classical FR II object (Fanaroff & Riley 1974) is very clearly edge brightened\nthanks to the hot spots located at the source's extremities, and CSS sources,\nregardless of whether they are strong or weak, very often follow this pattern -\nsee e.g. 1709+303. However, we found a few sources which, although in principle\nmight be labelled FR II just because they are double-lobed but not FR Is, are not\nfeatured by well-defined hot spots. These are 1009+408, 1236+327, 1542+323,\n1656+391, and 1717+315 (Figures 4 and 5). Their lobes are diffuse and often\n'amoeba-shaped' - 1542+323 (Figure 4) serves as the best example here. We\nthink these are 'dying' sources, i.e. AGN where the central engine activity has\nstopped and the lobes are in the so-called 'coasting phase'. This subclass may be\ninterpreted as a dead end of the evolution. We discuss this phenomenon in detail\nin Paper II.\n\nReferences\nCondon, J.J., Cotton, W.D., Greisen, E.W., Yin, Q.F., Perley, R.A., Taylor, G.B., &\nBroderick, J.J. 1998, AJ, 115, 1693\nDallacasa, D., Tinti, S., Fanti, C., Fanti, R., Gregorini, L., Stanghellini, C., & Vigotti,\nM. 2002a, A&A, 389, 115\nDallacasa, D., Fanti, C., Giacintucci S., Stanghellini, C., Fanti, R., Gregorini, L., &\nVigotti, M. 2002b, A&A, 389, 126\nDouglas, J.N., Bash, F.N., Arakel Bozyan, F., & Torrence, G.W., 1996, AJ, 111, 1945\nFanaroff, B.L., & Riley, J.M. 1974, MNRAS, 167, 31P\nFanti, C., Pozzi, F., Dallacasa, D., Fanti, R., Gregorini, L., Stanghellini, C., & Vigotti,\nM. 2001, A&A, 369, 380\nKunert, M., Marecki, A., Spencer, R.E., Kus, A.J., & Niezgoda, J. 2002, A&A, 391,\n47\n3\n\n\fMarecki, A., Spencer, R.E., & Kunert, M. 2003, PASA, 20, in press (Paper II)\nWhite, R.L., & Becker, R.H. 1992, ApJS, 79, 331\nWhite, R.L., Becker, R.H., Helfand, D.J., & Gregg, M.D. 1997, ApJ, 475, 479\n\n4\n\n\fCONT: 1148+387 IPOL 1655.459 MHZ 1148+387.ICLN.38\n\nCONT: 1148+387 IPOL 4960.990 MHZ 1148+387.ICLN.62\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\nCONT: 1148+387 IPOL 4994.000 MHZ 1148+387.ICLN.7\n0.8\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n0.4\n\nARC SEC\n\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-0.4\n-100\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-150\n\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nARC SEC\nCenter at RA 11 51 29.40586 DEC 38 25 52.6989\nROT -0.01524\nCont peak flux = 5.9067E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-04 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\n-200\n\n-200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 11 51 29.36473 DEC 38 25 52.4450\nCont peak flux = 5.0787E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 1.000E-03 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 11 51 29.36473 DEC 38 25 52.4450\nCont peak flux = 5.0205E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 1.000E-03 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\nFigure 1: MERLIN (6 cm), VLBA (18 cm), and EVN (6 cm) maps of 1148+387.\n\nCONT: 1343+386 IPOL 4971.490 MHZ 1343+386.ICLN.10\n200\n\nCONT: 1343+386 IPOL 1655.459 MHZ 1343+386.ICLN.18\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\nCONT: 1343+386 IPOL 4994.500 MHZ 1343+386.ICLN.7\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n100\n0.6\n\n100\n\nMilliARC SEC\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n-0.2\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n-0.4\n\n-50\n\n-50\n\n-0.6\n-0.8\n\n-100\n-1.0\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\nARC SEC\nCenter at RA 13 45 36.95762 DEC 38 23 12.7367\nROT 0.15671\nCont peak flux = 2.4772E-01 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-04 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\n100\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 13 45 36.94445 DEC 38 23 12.4050\nCont peak flux = 2.7273E-01 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 1.000E-03 * (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512)\n\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 13 45 36.95100 DEC 38 23 12.6400\nCont peak flux = 8.5741E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 4.000E-04 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\nFigure 2: MERLIN (6 cm), VLBA (18 cm), and EVN (6 cm) maps of 1343+386.\n\nCONT: 1601+382 IPOL 4994.500 MHZ 1601+382.ICLN.9\nCONT: 1709+303 IPOL 1655.459 MHZ 1709+303.ICLN.33\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n150\n\n0.2\n100\n\n0.0\nMilliARC SEC\n\nARC SEC\n\nARC SEC\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-0.6\n-50\n\n-0.8\n-1.0\n\n-100\n\n1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 -0.4 -0.6\nARC SEC\nCenter at RA 16 03 35.15600 DEC 38 06 42.9814\nROT 0.30878\nCont peak flux = 4.4523E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 3.000E-04 * (-1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)\n\n100\n50\n0\n-50\n-100\n-150\nMilliARC SEC\nCenter at RA 17 11 19.94038 DEC 30 19 17.8360\nCont peak flux = 4.1910E-02 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 1.000E-03 * (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512)\n\n-200\n\n-250\n\n-300\n\nFigure 3: MERLIN (6 cm) map of 1601+382 (left);
