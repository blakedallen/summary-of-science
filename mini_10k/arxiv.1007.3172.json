Introduction and statement of the result\nLet x = (\u03be, \u03b6) \u2208 Rk \u00d7 RN \u2212k , with k, N \u2212 k \u2265 2. A function u : RN \u2192 R is termed biradial if\nit is invariant under the action of the subgroup SO(k) \u00d7 SO(N \u2212 k) of the group of rotations,\nnamely, if there exists \u03c6 : R+ \u00d7 R+ \u2192 R such that u(\u03be, \u03b6) = \u03c6(|\u03be|, |\u03b6|). Consider the equation\na\n(1)\n\u2212 \u2206u =\nu + f (|x| , u)\nin RN \\ {0},\n|x|2\nin this paper, we wonder under what circumstances it is possible to assert that a biradial\nsolution to (1) is actually radially symmetric.\nThis problem arises from [12], where the following symmetry breaking result is given for\nthe critical nonlinearity f (|x| , u) = u(N +2)/(N \u22122) : if a < 0 and |a| is sufficiently large, there\nare at least two distinct positive solutions, one being radially symmetric and the second\nnot. These solution are obtained by minimization of the associated Rayleigh quotient over\nfunctions possessing either the full radial symmetry or a discrete group of symmetries, namely,\nfor given k \u2208 Z, functions which are invariant under the Zk \u00d7 SO(N \u2212 2)-action on D1,2 (RN )\ngiven by\n\u0001\nu(\u03be, \u03b6) 7\u2192 v(\u03be, \u03b6) = u R\u03be, T \u03b6 ,\n\nT being any rotation of RN \u22122 and R a fixed rotation of order k. Once proved that the infimum\ntaken over the Zk \u00d7SO(N \u22122)-invariant functions is achieved, by comparing its value with the\ninfimum taken over the radial functions, one deduces the occurrence of symmetry breaking\n(see also [1]).\nIn order to obtain multiplicity of solutions, the first attempt is to increase the order k\nof the symmetry group and, eventually, to let it diverge to infinity, finding in the limit a\nminimizer of the Rayleigh quotient over the biradial functions. Now, will all these solutions\nbe distinct and different from the radial one? When examining this question, we need to take\nDate: November 23, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35J75, 35B06, 35B50, 35B51.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL. ABATANGELO AND S. TERRACINI\n\ninto account the construction due to Ding of an infinity of nontrivial biradial solutions to the\nLane\u2013Emden equation with critical nonlinearity (cfr [4]). In that case it is well known that\nthere is a unique family of radially symmetric solutions, which are the global minimizers of\nthe Rayleigh quotients, while in Ding's construction the nontrivial biradial solutions have a\nMorse index larger than 2.\nWe recall the following definition:\nDefinition 1.1. The (plain, radial, biradial) Morse index of a solution u is the dimension\nof the maximal subspace of the space of (all, radial, biradial) functions of C0\u221e (RN \\ {0}) on\nwhich the quadratic form associated to the linearized equation at u is negative definite.\nWe stress it is rather a geometric definition, so it is independent from any spectral theory\nabout the differential operator we are dealing with.\nThe recent literature indicates that, for general semilinear equations, solutions having low\nMorse index do likely possess extra symmetries. Following these ideas and questions, we\ninvestigated in particular the biradial solutions with a low Morse index, and we are able to\nprove the following\nTheorem 1.2. Let u \u2208 D1,2 (RN ) be a biradial solution to\na\nu + f (|x| , u)\n(2)\n\u2212 \u2206u =\n|x|2\n\u00012\nwith a > \u2212 N 2\u22122 and f : RN \u00d7 R \u2192 R being a Carath\u00e9odory function, C 1 with respect to z,\nsuch that it satisfies the growth restriction\n\u2217 \u22122\n\nfy\u2032 (|x| , y) \u2264 C(1 + |y|2\n\n)\n\nfor a.e. x \u2208 RN and for all y \u2208 C.\nIf the solution u has biradial Morse index m(u) \u2264 1, then u is radially symmetric.\nAn analogous result also holds for bounded domains having rotational symmetry, and for\nelliptic equations on the sphere. The following result holds in any dimension N \u2265 3:\nTheorem 1.3. Let f \u2208 C 1 (R; R): if u \u2208 C 2 (SN ) is a biradial solution to\n\u2212\u2206SN u = f (u)\n\nwith N \u2265 3, and it has biradial Morse index m(v) \u2264 1, then u is constant on the sphere SN .\nThe paper is organized as follows: the next section is devoted to introduce the main tools\nand facts which will play a key role within the proof; in section 3 we present the proofs of\nTheorems 1.2 and 1.3 splitting it according to solutions' Morse index. In section 4 we give\napplications to the estimate of the best constants in some Sobolev type embeddings with\nsymmetries. Finally section 5 is devoted to the discussion of the sharpness of the Theorems\nwith respect to the Morse index.\n2. Preliminaries\nHere we start the proof of Theorem 1.2. For the sake of simplicity, we will work in dimension\nN = 4. We devote the last part of the proof to discuss the validity of the result in higher\ndimensions.\n\n\fBIRADIAL SOLUTIONS TO ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS\n\nLet us consider the following three orthogonal vector fields in R4 :\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u2212x3\nx4\nx2\n\uf8ef x4\n\uf8ef x3 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u2212x1 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nX1 = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 x4 \uf8fb , X2 = \uf8f0 \u2212x2 \uf8fb , X3 = \uf8f0 x1\n\u2212x2\n\u2212x1\n\u2212x3\n\nThe related derivatives\n\nwi = \u2207u * Xi ,\n\n3\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\nrepresent the infinitesimal variations of the function u along the flows of the vector fields Xi\nrespectively. As the equation is invariant under the action of such flows, these directional\nderivatives are solutions to the linearized equation\na\n(3)\n\u2212 \u2206w \u2212 2 w = fy\u2032 (|x| , u)w .\n|x|\nWe can associate the singular differential operator\na\n(4)\nLu w = \u2212\u2206w \u2212 2 w \u2212 fy\u2032 (|x| , u)w .\n|x|\n\nRemark 2.1. The vector space of {X1 , X2 , X3 } generates the whole group of infinitesimal\nrotations on the sphere of R4 , which can be structured as a 3-dimensional manifold. In order\nto prove Theorem 1.2 it will be sufficient to show that every wi \u2261 0.\nObviously, we have w1 \u2261 0 because the vector field X1 generates the rotations under which\nthe function u is invariant for. Let us fix polar coordinates\n(\n(\nx1 = r1 cos \u03b81\nx3 = r2 cos \u03b82\n(5)\nx2 = r1 sin \u03b81\nx4 = r2 sin \u03b82 ;\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwe have r1 = x1 2 + x2 2 , r2 = x3 2 + x4 2 and \u03b81 = arctan xx12 , \u03b82 = arctan xx43 .\nTherefore, since u is biradial, we have\nwi = \u2207u * Xi = w(r1 , r2 )zi (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) ,\n\ni = 2, 3 ,\n\nwhere\nw(r1 , r2 ) =\n\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\nr2 \u2212\nr1 ,\n\u2202r1\n\u2202r2\n\nz2 = sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ),\n\nz3 = \u2212 cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ).\n\nRemark 2.2. According to Remark 2.1, to our aim it will be sufficient to prove that w \u2261 0.\nWe now focus our attention on a few fundamental properties of the functions wi . At first,\nas the zi 's are spherical harmonics and depend on the angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 only, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n+\nzi\nfor i = 2, 3.\n(6)\n\u2212 \u2206zi =\nr12 r22\nJoining this with the linearized equation (3) solved by the wi 's, we obtain the equation for w.\nProposition 2.3. The function w is a solution to the following equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\na\n\u2032\n+\nw = 0.\n(7)\n\u2212 \u2206w \u2212 2 w \u2212 fy (|x| , u)w +\nr12 r22\n|x|\n\n\f4\n\nL. ABATANGELO AND S.

Proofs\nWe will split the argument according to the Morse index of solution u: we denote it by\nm(u).\nIn order to complete our proof, we need a couple of preliminary results: the first one is\nabout the asymptotics of the solution and is contained in [7].\nLemma 3.1.

In this case Lemma 3.3 clearly contradicts the\nhypothesis m(u) = 0, unless w+ = w\u2212 \u2261 0, that is the only stable solution to (7) is the trivial\none.\nSecond case: Morse index m(u) = 1. In this case we infer that w has constant sign, say\npositive, and therefore w > 0 for r1 > 0 and r2 > 0 by the Strong Maximum Principle. Now\nwe show a contradiction. Consider a vector field of the form \u03b1X2 + \u03b2X3 . Along this vector\nfield, choosing \u03b1 = cos \u03b3 and \u03b2 = sin \u03b3, the derivative of u is\n\u0001\n\u2207u * (\u03b1X2 + \u03b2X3 ) = \u03b1w2 + \u03b2w3 = w \u03b1 sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ) \u2212 \u03b2 cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ) = \u2212w sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b3).\n\nNow we turn to the directional derivative of \u03b81 + \u03b82 along the vector field \u03b1X2 + \u03b2X3 . Using\nthe polar coordinates (5), it results\nx4\nx2\n,\n\u03b82 = arctan ;\n\u03b81 = arctan\nx1\nx3\n\nso that checking the motion along X2 we have\nr2\nr2\nx3 x1 \u2212 x2 x4\ncos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )\n= (cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 \u2212 sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 ) =\n\u2207\u03b81 * X2 =\n2\n2\nr1\nr1\nx1 + x2\n\u2212x3 x1 + x2 x4\nr1\nr1\n\u2207\u03b82 * X2 =\n= (\u2212 cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 + sin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 ) = \u2212 cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ),\n2\n2\nr2\nr2\nx3 + x4\nwhereas along X3\n\u2207\u03b81 * X3 =\n\u2207\u03b82 * X3 =\n\nx4 x1 + x2 x3\nr2\nr2\nsin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )\n= (cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 + sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 ) =\nr1\nr1\nx21 + x22\n\u2212x2 x3 \u2212 x1 x4\nr1\nr1\n= (\u2212 sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 \u2212 cos \u03b81 sin \u03b82 ) = \u2212 sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 );\n2\n2\nr2\nr2\nx3 + x4\n\n\fBIRADIAL SOLUTIONS TO ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS\n\n7\n\nand finally we obtain\n\u2207(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ) * (\u03b1X2 + \u03b2X3 ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nr2 r1\n\u2212\nr1 r2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0001\n\u03b1 cos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 ) + \u03b2 sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 )\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr2 r1\n\u2212\ncos(\u03b81 + \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b3).\n=\nr1 r2\n\nNow we are in good position to conclude. For a given point x of the sphere - located by angles\n\u03b81 and \u03b82 , we choose \u03b3 = \u03b3(x) = \u03b81 + \u03b82 \u2212 \u03c0/2, so that the quantity \u03b81 + \u03b82 is at rest for\nthe associated vector field cos \u03b3X2 + sin \u03b3X3 . With this choice the function u is monotone\nalong the flow \u03b1X2 + \u03b2X3 since u\u0307 = \u2212w sin(\u03b81 + \u03b82 \u2212 \u03b3) = \u2212w and the sign of w is constant\nby the previous discussion. Since the trajectory of the flow is a circle, we will reach again\nthe initial point in finite time, but with a strictly smaller value of u (if we consider the first\neigenfunction w positive). This is clearly a contradiction.\nGeneralization to higher dimensions. In dimension N \u2265 5 the argument is very similar.\nRelabeling we may always q\nassume u = u(\u03c11 , \u03c12 ), where we have fixed the notation \u03c11 = |\u03be|\nand \u03c12 = |\u03b6|, while |x| = |\u03be|2 + |\u03b6|2 , being x = (\u03be, \u03b6) \u2208 Rk \u00d7 RN \u2212k . Now we repeat the\nargument performed in the 4-dimensional space with respect to the variables xk\u22121 , xk , xk+1 ,\nxk+2 , considering the vector fields with\nas above and the other\nqthose same four components\nq\n\nones being zero. Hence we define r1 = x2k\u22121 + x2k and r2 = x2k+1 + x2k+2 . When discussing\nthe integrability properties, it can be worthwhile noticing that\n1 \u2202u\n1 \u2202u\n=\n.\nri \u2202ri\n\u03c1i \u2202\u03c1i\nArguing as above, we can prove that the solution u is actually radial with respect to those four\nvariables. We can imagine to iterate this proceeding for every hyperplane whose rotations the\nfunction u is supposed not to be invariant for. Finally, it follows that u is radial in RN .\nProof of Theorem 1.3.

Then u = (v \u25e6 f )\u03c6 is a\nR\n\u2217\ndVg = N |v|2 dVh .\n\nWe consider the inverse of the stereographic projection \u03c0 : SN \\ {p} \u2192 RN . We denote it\nby \u03a6 = \u03c0 \u22121 : RN \u2192 SN \\ {p}, moreover g0 will denote the standard metric on SN and \u03b4 the\nstandard one on RN .\nThe diffeomorphism \u03a6 is conformal between the two manifolds, since it results\n4\n.\ng = \u03a6\u2217 g0 = \u03bc(x) N\u22122 \u03b4 ,\nwhere\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 N\u22122\n2\n2\n\u03bc(x) =\n.\n2\n1 + |x|\nIn addition, we point out the manifold (RN , g) is the same as (SN , g0 ), in terms of diffeomorphic manifolds.\nWe recall the following\nDefinition 5.2. We define the conformal Laplacian on a differentiable closed manifold (M, g)\nof dimension N the operator\nN \u22122\nRg\nLg = \u2212\u2206g +\n4(N \u2212 1)\nwhere \u2206g denotes the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator on M and Rg the scalar curvature\nof the manifold.\nMoreover, this operator has a simple transformation law under a conformal change of\nmetric, that is\n\u0001\nN+2\n4\nif ge = \u03bc(x) N\u22122 g\nthen Leg * = \u03bc(x)\u2212 N\u22122 Lg \u03bc(x) * .\n\nIn our case we are dealing with the same manifold RN endowed with the two metrics \u03b4, the\nstandard one, and g = \u03a6\u2217 g0 . Thus in our case we have\n1\nL\u03b4 = \u2212\u2206\nLg = \u2212\u2206g + N (N \u2212 2)\n4\nso it is quite easy to check directly the correspondence between the equations stated in Lemma\n5.1 by calculations.\n5.2. Proof of the optimality of Theorem 1.2 with respect to the Morse index. In\nthis section we discuss the optimality of Theorems 1.3 with respect to the solutions' Morse\nindex. First of all, we consider the the equation on the sphere SN related to (2) through the\nweighted composition with the stereographic projection \u03c0 as conformal diffeomorphism from\nSN \\ {p} onto RN : it is immediate to check that it is\n1\ny \u2208 SN .\n\u2212\u2206SN v(y) + N (N \u2212 2)v(y) = f (v(y))\n4\n\n\fBIRADIAL SOLUTIONS TO ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS\n\n11\n\nIn his paper [4], Ding states the following result:\nLemma 5.3. There exists a sequence {vk } of biradial solutions to the equation\n4\n1\n(16)\n\u2212 \u2206SN v + N (N \u2212 2)v = |v| N\u22122 v\nv \u2208 C 2 (SN )\n4\nR\n2N\nsuch that SN |vk | N\u22122 dV \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThe choice of working in a space of biradial is motivated by the compact embedding of the\nspace of H 1 \u2013biradial functions on the sphere into L2N/(N \u22122) . In this way one can overcome\nthe lack of compactness due to the presence of the critical exponent and prove the result\nas an application of the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz symmetric Mountain Pass Theorem. We\nare interested in classifying the solutions according to their Morse index. We can state the\nfollowing\nLemma 5.4. Among the solutions {vk } in Lemma 5.3 there is also a constant one, which is\nunique and corresponds to the minimum of Sobolev quotient. All the other biradial solutions\nhave biradial Morse index at least 2, and there is at least one non constant biradial solution\nhaving Morse index exactly 2.\nProof. We can check directly there exists a unique constant solution:\n\u0012\n\u0013 N\u22122\n4\nN+2\n1\n1\nN\u22122\n=\u21d2 c =\n.\nN (N \u2212 2)c = c\nN (N \u2212 2)\n4\n4\n\nwhich corresponds to the Talenti functions on the sphere ([11]). We mean it is the image of\n\u0001 N\u22122\n4\nN (N \u22122)\n= \u03bc(x)c through the diffeomorphism \u03c0 \u22121 and\nthe function w(x) =\nN\u22122\n\u0001\n1+|x|2\n\n2\n\n\u0001\nN+2\nLg c = \u03bc(x)\u2212 N\u22122 \u2206 \u03bc(x)c .\n\nThen it reaches the minimum of Sobolev quotient inf v6=0\n\n\u0012\n\nR\n\nR\n\nSN |\u2207v|2\n2N\n\n|v| N\u22122\nSN\n\n\u00132/2\u2217 ,\n\nand therefore it is\n\nquite simple to prove it is the mountain pass solution, i.e. its (plain, radial, biradial) Morse\nindex is m(c) = 1. Now, thanks to Theorem 1.3, every other biradial solution having biradial\nMorse index at most 1 is constant, hence all the other solutions have biradial Morse index at\nleast 2. Now, it is well known that Talenti's solutions are unique among positive solutions\nof equation (2) on RN , so we can assert that the only biradial positive solutions of (16) are\nconstant. On the other hand, it can be proven for example using Morse Theory in ordered\nBanach spaces (see [2]), that the equation admits a biradial sign-changing solution having\nbiradial Morse index at most 2. Hence there is a biradial solution of (16) with Morse index\nexactly 2 which is not constant.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] L. Abatangelo and S.
