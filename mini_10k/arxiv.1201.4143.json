We used homology and cohomology in analogy with the theory of electromagnetism, since this is the most natural approach to this topic, before introducing more\nrefined instruments as K-theory. We have shown that, for p \u2265 0, the Ramond-Ramond\npotentials Cp+1 are the highest degree components of a connection on a p-gerbe with U(1)band (considering line bundles as 0-gerbes), while the associated field-strength Gp+2 is the\ncorresponding curvature, satisfying the Dirac quantization condition.\nThe geometry of abelian p-gerbes with connection can be described in a unitary way\nusing Deligne cohomology. A p-gerbe is topologically classified by its first Chern class, and\na connection is completely determined by its holonomy. The latter is a function from the\nspace of (p + 1)-submanifolds without boundary to U(1), and a section of a line bundle over\nthe space of (p + 1)-submanifolds with boundary: physically it corresponds to the WessZumino action, i.e. to the the minimal coupling of the local Ramond-Ramond potentials to\nthe D-brane world-volume.\n1\n\n\fThe geometry of these objects is clear for p \u2265 0, considering line bundles as 0-gerbes;\nin these cases the Ramond-Ramond field strength Gp+2 has degree at least 2. Actually, one\ncan encounter lower degree Ramond-Ramond fields: in IIB superstring theory there is also\nthe 1-form field-strength G1 , while in IIA superstring theory there is a 0-form field strength\nG0 , which corresponds in the semiclassical limit to the 0-form field-strength of the massive\n(or Romans) IIA supergravity [9]. A 0-form is a function, and actually G0 turns out to be\nconstant and integral. For G1 the local potentials are the functions C0 , while G0 does not\nhave any potential. The geometry of these objects is simple in itself, but it is interesting to\nexplicitly show the analogy with the higher degree cases, in order to have a unitary picture for\nthe Ramond-Ramond fields. We thus introduce the notion of (\u22121)-gerbes and (\u22122)-gerbes,\nand we show how to deal with connections, holonomies, curvatures and first Chern class for\nsuch gerbes. We show that in order to include also these low-degree gerbes it is better to\nintroduce a variant of the ordinary \u010cech cohomology, which we call hat-cohomology.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we briefly recall how to describe the\nRamond-Ramond fields using the language of p-gerbes with connection. In section 3 we\nshow how to describe the low-degree Ramond-Ramond fields, introducing a variant of \u010cech\ncohomology with is suitable to describe p-gerbes with U(1)-band for any p \u2208 Z. In section\n4 we include the cases p = \u22121 and p = \u22122 in the theory of connections, holonomies and\ncurvatures on p-gerbes, showing some simple examples. In section 5 we draw our conclusions.\n\nRamond-Ramond fields and p-gerbes\n\n2\n\nIf we consider the classical magnetic monopole in 3+1 space-time dimensions [8], it is wellknown that, because of the Dirac quantization condition, the field strength F\u03bc\u03bd can be\nconsidered as the curvature of a connection on a gauge bundle on R3 \\ {0}, whose first Chern\nclass, belonging to H 2(R3 \\ {0}, Z) \u2243 Z, corresponds to the magnetic charge fixed in the\norigin. If we argue in the same way for a monopole in a generic space-time dimension n + 1,\nwe need a gauge invariant integral (n \u2212 1)-form F\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn\u22121 , whose integral on an (n \u2212 1)dimensional sphere around the origin of Rn is the magnetic charge (up to a normalization\nconstant). Hence, because of the Dirac quantization condition, such a field strength can\nbe thought of as the curvature of a connection on a (n \u2212 3)-gerbe with U(1)-band, whose\nfirst Chern class, belonging to H n\u22121 (Rn \\ {0}, Z) \u2243 Z, corresponds to the charge fixed in\nthe origin. That's why p-gerbes naturally arise when dealing with monopoles in a spacetime of generic dimension. Since a D-brane, at a semiclassical level, can be thought of as\na generalized magnetic monopole, it follows that the Ramond-Ramond potentials C\u03bc1 ...\u03bcp+1\nand field strengths G\u03bc1 ...\u03bcp+2 can be thought of respectively as a connection and its curvature\non an abelian p-gerbe.\n\n2.1\n\nGerbes and Cech hypercohomology\n\nWe refer to [6] for an introduction to gerbes, and to [3] for a more formal discussion. The\nmain features of an abelian p-gerbe on a manifold X are:\n\u2022 the equivalence class (up to isomorphism) of the p-gerbe [G] \u2208 \u021e p+1 (X, U(1)), for U (1)\nthe sheaf of U(1)-valued smooth functions;\n2\n\n\f\u2022 the first Chern class c1 (G) \u2208 H p+2(X, Z), which completely determines the equivalence\nclass of the p-gerbe;\nd \u0303\n\n\u2022 the equivalence class of the couple gerbe+connection [(G, \u2207)] \u2208 \u021e p+1(X, U (1) \u2212\u2192\nd\nd\n\u03a91R \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR ) (we will recall in the following the definition of this group);\n\u2022 the holonomy of the connection Hol\u2207 : Lp+1 X \u2192 U(1), for Lp+1 X the space of (p + 1)dimensional submanifolds of X without boundary;\n\u2022 the curvature of the connection, which is a closed integral (p + 2)-form F \u2208 \u03a9p+2\nR (X)\nsuch that [F ]dR \u2243 c1 (G) \u2297Z R;\n\u2022 flat connections are classified by H p+1 (X, U(1)), for U(1) the constant sheaf, and the\nfirst Chern classes of the p-gerbes on which they can be defined belong to the torsion\nsubgroup of H p+2 (X, Z).\nLet us briefly comment these features. Since the equivalence class belongs to the (p + 1)cohomology group, with respect to a good cover U = {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I of X the transition functions\nare defined on the (p + 2)-intersections, thus they are functions g\u03b10 ...\u03b1p+1 : U\u03b10 \u2229 . . . \u2229 U\u03b1p+1 \u2192\nU(1). To compute the first Chern class, we use the Bockstein map of the sequence 0 \u2192\nZ \u2192 R \u2192 U (1) \u2192 1 in degree p + 1. Concretely, we write the transition functions as\ng\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 = e2\u03c0i\u03c1\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 , so that \u03b4\u030c{\u03c1\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 } = {c\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+2 } with c\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+2 \u2208 Z, and we get\nc1 (G) = [{c\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+2 }] \u2208 \u021e p+2(X, Z). A p-gerbe with connection is an element of the \u010cech\nhypercohomology group (called Deligne cohomology group):\nd \u0303\n\nd\n\nd\n\n\u021e p+1 (X, U(1) \u2212\u2192 \u03a91R \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR )\n\n(1)\n\n1\nfor d \u0303 = 2\u03c0i\nd \u25e6 log. To define this group, we consider the \u010cech double complex with respect\nto a good cover U associated to the complex U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR , and the group\n(1) is the (p + 1)-th cohomology group of the associated total complex. Hence, the group\np+1\nof (p + 1)-cochains is \u010c p+1 (U, U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\n(U, U (1)) \u2295 \u010c p (U, \u03a91R ) \u2295\nR ) = \u010c\n* * *\u2295 \u010c 0 (U, \u03a9p+1\nR ), and a representative hypercocycle of a gerbe with connection is a sequence\n(p)\n(g\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 , (C1 )\u03b10 ***\u03b1p , . . . , (Cp\u2032 )\u03b10 \u03b11 , (Cp+1 )\u03b10 ), satisfying the conditions:\n\n(Cp+1)\u03b2 \u2212 (Cp+1 )\u03b1 = (\u22121)p+1 d(Cp\u2032 )\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2032\u2032\n(Cp\u2032 )\u03b1\u03b2 + (Cp\u2032 )\u03b2\u03b3 + (Cp\u2032 )\u03b3\u03b1 = (\u22121)p d(Cp\u22121\n)\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n...\n(p)\n1\n\u03b4\u030c p (C1 )\u03b10 ...\u03b1p = 2\u03c0i\nd log g\u03b10 ...\u03b1p+1\np+1\n\u03b4\u030c g\u03b10 ...\u03b1p+1 = 1.\n\n(2)\n\nThe local forms dCp+1 glue to a gauge-invariant one Gp+2 , which is the curvature of the pgerbe, but the data of the superstring background must include a complete equivalence class\n(p)\nrepresented by (g\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 , (C1 )\u03b10 ***\u03b1p , . . . , (Cp\u2032 )\u03b10 \u03b11 , (Cp+1)\u03b10 ), not only the top-forms Cp+1 .\nAs for line bundles, the correspondence [Gp+2 ]dR \u2243 c1 (G) \u2297Z R holds, in particular the Dirac\nquantization condition applies for any p. From a physical point of view, Deligne cohomology\ndescribes gauge transformations. Conditions (2) specify how the local potentials glue on the\n3\n\n\f(p)\n\nintersections, and this concerns a single representative (g\u03b10 ***\u03b1p+1 , (C1 )\u03b10 ***\u03b1p , . . . , (Cp+1)\u03b10 )\nof the equivalence class. There are also possible gauge transformations consisting in the\naddition of a coboundary, the latter being of the form:\n(p\u22121)\n\n\u03b4{h\u03b10 ...\u03b1p , (C1\n\n)\u03b10 ...\u03b1p\u22121 , . . . , (Cp )\u03b10 } =\n(p\u22121)\n\n{\u03b4\u030c p h\u03b10 ...\u03b1p , d\u0303h\u03b10 ...\u03b1p + \u03b4\u030c p\u22121(C1\n\n(1)\n\n)\u03b10 ...\u03b1p\u22121 , . . . , (\u22121)p\u22121d(Cp\u22121)\u03b10 \u03b11 \u2212 (Cp )\u03b10 + (Cp )\u03b11 }.\n\nThere real data is not the single representative, but the cohomology class itself, since it is\ndetermined by the two real physical observables: the field strength (corresponding to the\nfield F in electromagnetism) and the holonomy of the connection or Wess-Zumino action\n(corresponding in electromagnetism to the phase difference measured in the context of the\nAranhov-Bohm effect).\nWe can define the holonomy (i.e. the exponential of the Wilson loop) for p-gerbes generalizing the definition for line bundles. For p = 1 we refer to [1], for p > 1 it becomes more\ncomplicated to write down, but the properties are the same: it is a well-defined function on\nthe space of (p + 1)-submanifolds without boundary, while it is the section of a line bundle\nover the space of (p + 1)-submanifolds with boundary. To obtain a geometrical intuition for\nsuch objects one must deal with sheaves of p-categories (for p = 1 a good reference is [3]),\nbut the language of Deligne cohomology is enough for our purposes.\n\n2.2\n\nWess-Zumino action and D-branes duality\n\nWe work in type II superstring theory on a 10-dimensional background X, with vanishing\nH-flux. The Ramond-Ramond field strength Gp+2 can be thought of as the curvature of a\nconnection on an abelian p-gerbe, while the local Ramond-Ramond potentials Cp+1 are the\nhighest degree components of the connection. There is a natural duality between Dp-branes\nand D(6 \u2212 p)-branes, because a D(6 \u2212 p)-brane minimally couples, via the Wess-Zumino\naction, to the potential of the Ramond-Ramond field whose source is a Dp-brane.1 In fact,\nlet us consider a Dp-brane with (p + 1)-dimensional world-volume W Yp , for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 6. The\nviolated Bianchi identity is:\ndG8\u2212p = qp * \u03b4(W Yp )\n\ndGp+2 = 0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere qp is the charge, or equivalently, the number of D-branes in the stack. To compute\nthe charge from the background data, we consider a linking manifold2 L of W Yp in S with\nlinking number l, so that, from (3), we get:\nZ\n1\nqp =\nG8\u2212p .\n(4)\nl L\nThus the Dp-brane is a charged source for the Ramond-Ramond field-strength G8\u2212p . Let us\nnow consider a D(6 \u2212 p)-brane with (7 \u2212 p)-dimensional world-volume W Y6\u2212p , moving in the\n1\n\nIn the democratic formulation of supergravity, Dp-branes and D(6 \u2212 p)-branes are also sources of Hodgedual Ramond-Ramond field-strengths G8\u2212p and Gp+2 .\n2\nA linking manifold is the boundary of a manifold intersecting W Yp transversally in isolated points of its\ninterior.\n\n4\n\n\fG8\u2212p -field generated by the Dp-brane. The Wess-Zumino action is:\nZ\nC7\u2212p\nSW Z = q6\u2212p\n\n(5)\n\nW Y6\u2212p\n\nwhere the integral (actually, its exponential) should be interpreted as the holonomy of the\n(6 \u2212 p)-gerbe connection on W Y6\u2212p [4]. Since dC7\u2212p = G8\u2212p , the D(6 \u2212 p)-brane minimally\ncouples to the connection associated to the field generated by the Dp-brane.\nThis duality between Dp-branes and D(6 \u2212 p)-branes is clear for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 6. Let us now\nconsider p \u2265 7. In this case, we need to consider D-branes of negative dimension [9]. For a\nD7-brane, the charge can be computed from (4) with p = 7, so that the generated field is\nG1 . Its potential is C0 , a locally-defined 0-form, thus a locally-defined function. The dual\nD(\u22121)-brane has 0-dimensional world-volume, thus it is a D-instanton, whose action is by\nanalogy with (5):\nSW Z = q\u22121 * C0 (W Y\u22121),\nwhere W Y\u22121 is a point in which we evaluate C0 . What is the analogy between C0 , which\nis a locally-defined function, and the other potentials, which are connections on a p-gerbe?\nMoreover, the connections on a p-gerbe are determined, up to gauge transformations, by\ntheir holonomy: what is the holonomy of C0 ? We will try to clarify this in the following\nchapters.\nFor a D8-brane, the charge can be computed from (4) with p = 8, so that the generated\nfield is G0 . Since it is already a function, it has no potential. As all the other field strengths\nit must be closed, hence constant. The Dirac quantization condition is usually interpreted\nas the requirement that G0 is an integer number, even if this not the most general case, as\nwe show in the following. The dual D(\u22122)-brane has (\u22121)-dimensional world-volume, thus\nit does not exist. This is coherent with the fact that there is no potential. In other words,\nthere are no branes minimally coupling to the field generated by a D8-brane: in fact, a\nD8-brane has a 9-dimensional world-volume which breaks in two pieces the space-time, and\nthe field generated is the locally constant field G0 whose variation across the world-volume is\nthe charge; each of the two parts is independent, thus it is impossible to find moving charges\nmeasuring such a difference since they cannot cross the wall.\nFinally, we should consider D9-branes, but, as is well-known, they have no charge: that's\nbecause, since they fill the whole space-time, there is no possibility for the fluxes to go\nat infinity. It is the analogue of an electron on a 2-sphere: we must put an anti-electron\nin another point, otherwise the theory is inconsistent. Actually, the Wess-Zumino action\nshould be (5) with p = \u22123, but C10 is a volume form which is non-dynamical and, as we\nhave already said, q9 has no meaning.\nSummarizing:\n\u2022 for 0 \u2264 p \u2264 6, the Ramond-Ramond field G8\u2212p generated by a Dp-brane is a curvature\nof a connection on a p-gerbe, whose holonomy is the Wess-Zumino action of a test\nD(6 \u2212 p)-brane;\n\u2022 for p = 7, the Ramond-Ramond field G1 generated by a D7-branes is a 1-form, whose\npotential is a locally defined function C0 ; the Wess-Zumino action of a D(\u22121)-brane,\nor D-instanton, is the value of C0 on the world-volume, which is a point;\n5\n\n\f\u2022 for p = 8, the Ramond-Ramond field G0 generated by a D8-branes is a constant integral\nfunction, without potential;\n\u2022 for p \u2265 9 there are no D-branes.\nThus, we should find a unitary description of abelian p-gerbes with connection (where 0gerbes are line bundles), leading for p = \u22121 to 1-forms with potential, for p = \u22122 to a\nconstant function without potential, and for p \u2264 \u22123 just to the trivial case. Moreover, we\nshould extend in a unitary way the definition of holonomy and first Chern class to these\ncases.\n\n2.3\n2.3.1\n\nThe low degree Ramond-Ramond fields\nThe Ramond-Ramond potential C0\n\nWe now consider in detail the case of C0 , that should correspond to the case of (\u22121)gerbes: we start with the topological description, while we will discuss later how to define\nconnections.\nBy analogy, it is natural to define a (\u22121)-gerbe (up to isomorphism) as a cohomology\nclass in \u021e 0 (X, U (1)), i.e. as a function f : X \u2192 U(1). We can define the first Chern class of\nsuch a function as a class in \u021e 1 (X, Z), computed via the Bockstein map in degree 0 of the\nsequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 U(1) \u2212\u2192 1.\n(6)\nWe concretely compute it as usual: we define f |U\u03b1 = e2\u03c0i\u03c1\u03b1 , so that \u03c1\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b2 = \u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z,\nand [{\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2 }] \u2208 \u021e 1 (X, Z) is c1 (f ). In string theory the local logarithms \u03c1\u03b1 are the RamondRamond potentials (C0 )\u03b1 , while the globally defined exponential f = e2\u03c0i(C0 )\u03b1 , which we will\ncall C\u03030 , is the path-integral measure corresponding to the Wess-Zumino action of a D(\u22121)brane. Can we give a more geometrical characterization of the Chern class of a function with\nvalues in U(1)? Since H 1 (U(1), Z) \u2243 Z, given a function f : X \u2192 U(1) we can consider the\npull-back of a generator f \u2217 (\u00b11) \u2208 H 1 (X, Z). This turns out to be the first Chern class of f\n[6], once that we have fixed an orientation of U(1) in order to distinguish 1 and \u22121:\nLemma 2.1 Let us give to U(1) \u2282 C the counter-clockwise orientation, so that we fix an\noriented generator 1 \u2208 H 1 (U(1), Z) \u2243 Z. Then, for f : X \u2192 U(1):\nc1 (f ) = f \u2217 (1) .\nThe proof is in the appendix A. We have thus seen that it seems natural to define (\u22121)gerbes on X as functions f : X \u2192 U(1), and that the first Chern class, computed in\nanalogy with higher degree gerbes, has a clear geometric interpretation. The problem is\nthat, since \u021e 0 (X, R) is non-zero, while \u021e p (X, R) = 0 for any p \u2265 1 (because of the existence\nof partitions of unity), the Bockstein map \u03b20 associated to the sequence (6) is not injective,\nalthough it is still surjective. This means that the first Chern class of a (\u22121)-gerbe does\nnot characterize the (\u22121)-gerbe up to isomorphism, even topologically. We see from the\nexactness of (6) that the kernel of \u03b20 is made by functions which admits a global logarithm,\ni.e. functions such that f = e2\u03c0i\u03c1 for some \u03c1 : X \u2192 R. Of course if we compute the\nChern class as above we obtain 0, since \u03c1\u03b1 = \u03c1\u03b2 for every U\u03b1\u03b2 . We can give a topological\ncharacterization of such functions, thanks to the following simple lemma.\n6\n\n\fLemma 2.2 A function f : X \u2192 U(1) admits a global logarithm if and only if it is homotopic to the constant map 1.\nProof: If f = e2\u03c0i\u03c1 , since R is contractible we can find a homotopy F between \u03c1 and the\nzero map: for example, we can link \u03c1(x) to 0 with the segment joining them. Then, e2\u03c0iF\nis a homotopy between f and 1. Viceversa, the result follows from the homotopy lifting\nproperties of coverings [5], but we can also prove it from lemma 2.1. In fact, since the pullback in cohomology is homotopy-invariant, if f is homotopic to 1 then c1 (f ) = 1\u2217 (1) = 0,\nthus, from the exactness of (6), we deduce that it admits a global logarithm. \u0003\nIt follows that c1 (f ) = c1 (g) if and only if f is homotopic to g, hence the first Chern\nclass of a function uniquely characterizes its equivalence class up to homotopy. Therefore,\nif we want to keep the analogy between (\u22121)-gerbes and p-gerbes for p \u2265 0, we are in the\nfollowing situation:\n\u2022 if we want to keep the classification of p-gerbes via classes in \u021e p+1(X, U (1)), we must\ndefine a (\u22121)-gerbe, even up to isomorphism, as a function f : X \u2192 U(1);\n\u2022 if we want to preserve the topological classification via the first Chern class in \u021e p+2(X, Z),\nwe must define a (\u22121)-gerbe, up to isomorphism, as a homotopy class of functions\n[f : X \u2192 U(1)].\nIn the following subsection we see that there is a good reason to prefer the second case,\nwhich will be confirmed studying connections and holonomies.\n2.3.2\n\nThe Ramond-Ramond field strength G0\n\nThe Ramond-Ramond field strength G0 , in IIA superstring theory, is a 0-form without\npotential. Thus, we must also consider (\u22122)-gerbes, although they are very simple. Hence:\n\u2022 if we keep the first analogy with p-gerbes, we must define a (\u22122)-gerbe as a class in\n\u021e \u22121 (X, U (1)), which is 0, so we would not be able to define non-trivial (\u22122)-gerbes;\n\u2022 if we keep the second analogy with p-gerbes, we must define a (\u22122)-gerbe as an object\nclassified up to isomorphism by \u021e 0 (X, Z), the latter being isomorphic to Z for X\nconnected: this is correct, since G0 is a pure quantized curvature, expressed as a Zvalued function, necessarily constant since Z is discrete.\nTherefore it is better to preserve the classification up to isomorphism via the first Chern class\nin H p+2(X, Z): we then introduce a suitable variant of \u010cech cohomology, in order to restore\nthe symmetry even for the cohomology of U (1), leading to a good definition of p-gerbes with\nU(1)-band also for p < 0.\n\n3\n\nHat-cohomology\n\nWe introduce a variant of \u010cech cohomology, starting from sheaves of functions with value\nin a fixed abelian Lie group G, even of dimension 0 as Z, and then generalizing it to any\n7\n\n\fsheaf of abelian Lie groups, or even topological groups.3 We denote this cohomology theory\nas \u0124 \u2022 (X, F ) for F a sheaf of groups, and we denote by G the sheaf of smooth G-valued\nfunctions.\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nSheaves of G-valued functions\nFirst attempt\n\nWe keep in mind the case of (\u22121)-gerbes. Since we want to define them as homotopy classes\nof functions, we require that \u0124 0 (X, U (1)) is isomorphic to \u021e 0 (X, U (1)) / homotopy. Hence\nfor a generic sheaf G, remembering that \u021e 0 (X, G) is the set of smooth functions f : X \u2192 G,\nwe look for cohomology groups \u0124 \u2022 (X, G) satisfying:\n\u0124 0 (X, G) \u2243 \u021e 0 (X, G) / homotopy\n\u0124 i (X, G) \u2243 \u021e i (X, G) \u2200i \u2265 1.\n\n(7)\n\nThis means that we want to consider as 0-coboundaries the functions homotopic to the\nconstant function 1. Thus, we could modify the \u010cech complex in the following way:\n\u0108 \u22121 (X, G) = {f : X \u2192 G | f \u2243 1}\n\u0108 i (X, G) = \u010c i (X, G) \u2200i \u2265 0\n(8)\n\u22121\n\n\u03b4\u0302 (f ) = f\n\u03b4\u0302 i = \u03b4\u030c i \u2200i \u2265 0.\nIn this way the corresponding cohomology groups \u0124 \u2022 (X, G) satisfy exactly (7), since functions homotopic to 1 becomes coboundaries by definition. Is this definition correct? Actually,\nthis is not the case. Let us consider the exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 U (1) \u2212\u2192 1\n\n(9)\n\nand the associated sequence in cohomology starting from degree \u22121:\n\u0124 \u22121 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 \u22121 (X, R) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 \u22121 (X, U(1)) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 0 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u0124 0 (X, R).\nSince \u03b4\u0302 \u22121 is injective, the only (\u22121)-cocycle is 0 for any sheaf, therefore the first three groups\nvanish. Since Z is discrete, the only Z-valued function homotopic to 0 is the constant function\n0, so that \u0124 0 (X, Z) \u2243 \u021e 0 (X, Z). Moreover, since R is contractible, every R-valued function\nis homotopic to zero, so that \u0124 0 (X, R) \u2243 0. That's why the previous sequence becomes,\nsupposing for simplicity that X is connected:\n\u03b2\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 0.\nThis sequence is not exact, otherwise \u03b2 should be an isomorphism. To identify the problem,\nwe recall what happens for the ordinary \u010cech cohomology. If we consider a short exact\n3\n\nWe remark that we do not construct a cohomology theory of sheaves in the ordinary sense, since the\ncanonical axioms are not satisfied [2].\n\n8\n\n\fsequence of pre-sheaves 0 \u2192 P1 \u2192 P2 \u2192 P3 \u2192 0, it immediately follows from the definition\nthat the corresponding sequence of \u010cech-cochain complexes 0 \u2192 \u010c \u2022 (X, P1 ) \u2192 \u010c \u2022 (X, P2 ) \u2192\n\u010c \u2022 (X, P3 ) \u2192 0 is exact, therefore, by a standard homological algebra argument [5], we get\na long exact sequence in cohomology. Then, for a paracompact space (a smooth manifold is\nparacompact), one shows that even an exact sequence of sheaves 0 \u2192 F1 \u2192 F2 \u2192 F3 \u2192 0\nproduces a long exact sequence in cohomology [2]. In fact, on such a space, if P is a presheaf and P \u266e its sheafification, the \u010cech cohomology groups of P and P \u266e are canonically\nisomorphic. Hence, if we consider the quotient pre-sheaf F2 /F1 , the cohomology of F3 is\nisomorphic to the one of F2 /F1, so that the long sequence resulting from 0 \u2192 F1 \u2192 F2 \u2192\nF3 \u2192 0 is the same that one would get from 0 \u2192 F1 \u2192 F2 \u2192 F2 /F1 \u2192 0, the latter being\nan exact sequence of pre-sheaves. Therefore, the long sequence is exact. In our case, we\nhave not defined the (\u22121)-degree cochains for a pre-sheaf (actually, we will define them in\nsuch a way that they are equal to the ones of the sheafification), hence we work directly\nwith sheaves. In particular, we must verity that, given an exact sequence of abelian groups\n0 \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 0, the associated sequence of cochains 0 \u2192 \u0108 \u22121 (X, A) \u2192 \u0108 \u22121 (X, B) \u2192\n\u0108 \u22121 (X, C) \u2192 0 is exact. With the present definition this is not the case. In fact, let us\nconsider the sequence in degree \u22121 associated to (9), i.e.:\n0 \u2212\u2192 \u0108 \u22121 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u0108 \u22121 (X, R) \u2212\u2192 \u0108 \u22121 (X, U(1)) \u2212\u2192 1\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is equal to:\nexp(2\u03c0i *)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 {f : X \u2192 R} \u2212\u2192 {f : X \u2192 U (1) | f \u2243 1} \u2212\u2192 0 .\nIt is not exact, since exp is not injective. A constant function f : X \u2192 R with integer\nvalue belongs to the kernel of exp, but it is not necessarily 0. Such a constant function is\nof course liftable to a Z-valued function, but, in order to lie in \u0108 \u22121 (X, Z), the lift must be\nhomotopic to the identity, which is the case only for the constant function 0. The problem\nis that a homotopy F : X \u00d7 I \u2192 R between f and 0 is not liftable to Z, since it assumes\ncontinuous values, so, although a non-vanishing integral function f is homotopic to zero as\na real function, it is not homotopic to zero as an integral function, coherently with the fact\nthat \u0108 \u22121 (X, Z) = 0.\nFrom the previous discussion we deduce that the lack of injectivity of exp is due to the\nfact that it destroys the information about the homotopy. Therefore, one possible solution\nis to include the homotopy itself in the definition. We can define, for I = [0, 1]:\n\u0108 \u22121 (X, G) = {f : X \u00d7 I \u2192 G such that f |X\u00d7{0} = 1}\n\u0108 i (X, G) = \u010c i (X, G) \u2200i \u2265 0\n(11)\n\u22121\n\n\u03b4\u0302 (f ) = f |X\u00d7{1}\n\u03b4\u0302 i = \u03b4\u030c i \u2200i \u2265 0 .\nIn this way the sequence (10) becomes:\nexp(2\u03c0i *)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 0 \u2212\u2192 {f : X \u00d7 I \u2192 R, f |X\u00d7{0} = 0} \u2212\u2192 {f : X \u00d7 I \u2192 U(1), f |X\u00d7{0} = 1} \u2212\u2192 1.\n9\n\n\fNow exp is bijective, as immediately follows from the homotopy lifting property [5], since R\nis a cover of U(1). We can see directly the injectivity: in fact, let us suppose that e2\u03c0if = 1.\nThen f is integral, thus constant, and, since f |X\u00d7{0} = 0, it follows that f = 0.\nThis definition solves the problems about (\u22121)-gerbes, since \u0124 0(X, R) = 0. In fact, if\nwe consider a cocycle f : X \u2192 R, it is homotopic to the 0-map being R contractible, for\nexample via the homotopy F (x, t) = tf (x). Thus, F \u2208 \u0108 \u22121 (X, R) and \u03b4\u0302 \u22121 F = f , so that\nevery f is a coboundary. This means that the Bockstein map \u03b20 : \u0124 0 (X, U (1)) \u2192 \u0124 1 (X, Z)\nis now an isomorphism.\nLet us now see what happens for (\u22122)-gerbes. In this case, we have the same problem\nthat we had about (\u22121)-gerbes with ordinary \u010cech cohomology: by definition \u0124 \u22121 (X, R) is\nthe set of real-valued homotopies between 0 and itself, and this group is not zero, thus the\nBockstein map \u03b2\u22121 : \u0124 \u22121(X, U (1)) \u2192 \u0124 0(X, Z) is not injective. In fact, for X connected,\n\u0124 0 (X, Z) = Z as for \u010cech cohomology; instead, \u0124 \u22121(X, U (1)) is the set of homotopies\nf : X \u00d7I \u2192 U(1) between 1 and itself, and this group is much larger than Z (it is continuous),\nunless we consider also f up to homotopy. What we need is that \u0124 i (X, R) = 0 for every i.\nThe right solution is to quotient out also the (\u22121)-cocycles up to homotopy, so that, being\nR contractible, even the cohomology in degree \u22121 vanishes. Thus, we can define \u0108 \u22122 (X, G)\nconsidering homotopies of homotopies, and so on for any degree.\n3.1.2\n\nThe correct definition\n\nWe use the notation I := [0, 1] and J i \u2282 I i defined as J i := I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0} \u222a \u2202(I i\u22121 ) \u00d7 I (in\nparticular J 1 = {0}, thinking of I 0 as a point). We define:\n\u0108 i (X, G) = \u010c i (X, G) \u2200i \u2265 0\n\u0108 \u2212i (X, G) = {f : X \u00d7 I i \u2192 G such that f |X\u00d7J i = 1} \u2200i \u2265 1\n\n(12)\n\nwith coboundaries:\n\u03b4\u0302 i = \u03b4\u030c i\n\n\u2200i \u2265 0\n\n\u03b4\u0302 \u2212i (f ) = f |X\u00d7I i\u22121 \u00d7{1}\n\n\u2200i \u2265 1.\n\n(13)\n\nFirst of all, let us now verify that, given an exact sequence of abelian groups:\ni\n\n\u03c0\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 A \u2212\u2192 B \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 1\n\n(14)\n\nwe obtain an exact sequence of cochain complexes at negative degrees:\ni\u2217\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\n1 \u2212\u2192 \u0108 <0 (X, A) \u2212\u2192 \u0108 <0 (X, B) \u2212\u2192 \u0108 <0 (X, C) \u2212\u2192 1.\n\n(15)\n\nWe verify the exactness in each of the three positions of the sequence:\n\u2022 Injectivity of i\u2217 . Let us fix f \u2208 \u0108 \u2212i (X, A). Then, i(\u2212i) f = i \u25e6 f for i defined in (14),\nhence, being i injective, also i(\u2212i) is injective.\n\u2022 Exactness in the middle. Since \u03c0 (\u2212i) f = \u03c0\u25e6f for \u03c0 defined in (14), from the exactness of\n(14) in the middle it follows that \u03c0 (\u2212i) f = 1 if and only if f can be lifted to \u0108 \u2212i (X, A).\n10\n\n\f\u2022 Surjectivity of \u03c0 \u2217 . This easily follows from the fact that, for Lie groups, the projection\non the homogeneous space \u03c0 : B \u2192 B/A is an A-principal bundle, therefore it has the\nhomotopy lifting property [5]. Thus, a homotopy F : X \u00d7 I i\u22121 \u00d7 I \u2192 C \u2243 B/A can\nbe lifted to a homotopy F : X \u00d7 I i\u22121 \u00d7 I \u2192 B, once that we fix the lift of the starting\nfunction, which is 1 : X \u00d7 I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0} \u2192 B in the present case. Moreover, it is always\npossible to choose the lifted homotopy in such a way that it is still relative to X \u00d7\u2202I i\u22121 :\nin fact, the homotopy lifting property is by definition the lift extension property [5]\nfor the couple (X \u00d7 I i , X \u00d7 I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0}), while its version relative to X \u00d7 \u2202I i\u22121 is the\nlift extension property for the couple (X \u00d7 I i , X \u00d7 I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0} \u222a X \u00d7 \u2202I i\u22121 \u00d7 I); since\nthe couples (I i , I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0}) and (I i , I i\u22121 \u00d7 {0} \u222a \u2202I i\u22121 \u00d7 I) are homeomorphic, the two\nproperties are equivalent.\nWe can now show the structure of cocycles and coboundaries:\n\u2022 a (\u2212i)-cocycle is a function f : X \u00d7 I i \u2192 G such that f |X\u00d7\u2202I i = 1; a 0-cocycle is a\nfunction f : X \u2192 G as for the \u010cech cohomology;\n\u2022 a (\u2212i)-coboundary is a cocycle f homotopic to the identity relatively to X \u00d7 \u2202I i , since,\nif F is such a homotopy between f and 1, then f = \u03b4\u0302 \u2212i\u22121 F ; for the same reason, a\n0-coboundary is a function f : X \u2192 G homotopic to 1.\nIt follows that the hat-cohomology groups are:\n\u0124 i (X, G) = \u021e i (X, G) \u2200i \u2265 1\n\u0124 0(X, G) = \u021e 0 (X, G) / homotopy\n\u0124 \u2212i (X, G) = {f : X \u00d7 I i \u2192 G, f |X\u00d7\u2202I i = 1} / homotopy relative to \u2202I i \u2200i \u2265 1.\n\n(16)\n\nSince I i /\u2202I i is homeomorphic to the sphere S i , with a marked point p0 corresponding to\n\u2202I i /\u2202I i , we can think of \u0124 \u2212i (X, G) as the set of functions from X \u00d7 S i to G which are equal\nto 1 on X \u00d7 {p0 }, up to homotopy relative to X \u00d7 {p0 }. In particular, if we call F (X, G)\nthe space of smooth functions from X to G, it follows that:\n\u0124 \u2212i (X, G) \u2243 \u03c0i (F (X, G), 1) \u2200i \u2265 1,\nwhere \u03c0i (F (X, G), 1) is the i-th homotopy group with base-point the constant function 1.\nHence, the long exact sequence in cohomology at negative degrees, associated to an exact\nsequence of groups 0 \u2192 A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 0, is the long exact sequence in homotopy associated\nto the fibration F (X, A) \u2192 F (X, B) \u2192 F (X, C) [5].\n\n3.2\n\nGeneralization\n\nWe can generalize the definition of hat-cohomology to any sheaf of topological groups. In\nparticular, we remark that a homotopy between two functions f, g : X \u2192 Y is a continuous\n(or smooth) path in the space of continuous (or smooth) functions from X to Y : in other\nwords, a homotopy F : X \u00d7 I \u2192 Y , can be thought of as a path \u03c6 : I \u2192 C 0 (X, Y ) such\nthat \u03c6(0) = f and \u03c6(1) = g, defined by \u03c6(t)(x) = F (t, x). For the case Y = G, where G is\na Lie group or topological group, it holds that C 0 (X, G) = G(X), where G(X) is the group\n11\n\n\fof global sections of the sheaf G. Therefore, we can generalize (12) to a generic sheaf of\ntopological groups F in the following way:\n\u0108 i (X, F ) = \u010c i (X, F ) \u2200i \u2265 0\n\u0108 \u2212i (X, F ) = {\u03c6 : I i \u2192 F (X) such that \u03c6|J i = e} \u2200i \u2265 1\n\n(17)\n\nwhere e is the unit of F (X), with coboundaries:\n\u03b4\u0302 i = \u03b4\u030c i\n\n\u2200i \u2265 0\n\n\u2212i\n\n\u03b4\u0302 (\u03c6) = \u03c6|I i\u22121 \u00d7{1}\n\n\u2200i \u2265 1.\n\n(18)\n\nIt follows that:4\n\u0124 i (X, F ) = \u021e i (X, F ) \u2200i \u2265 1\n\u0124 0 (X, F ) = \u03c00 (F (X))\n\n(19)\n\n\u0124 \u2212i (X, F ) = \u03c0i (F (X), e) \u2200i \u2265 1.\nFor pre-sheaves, we can use the same definition replacing F (X) with \u021e 0 (X, F ), which coincides up to isomorphism with F \u266e (X), for F \u266e the sheafification of F [2]. The problem with\nthis generalization is to find the correct hypotheses in order to verify the exactness of (15),\nbut we do not develop this problem here, since it is not needed in the following.\n\n3.3\n\np-Gerbes and hat-cohomology\n\nLet us now come back to the exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 U(1) \u2212\u2192 1.\nFirst of all we obtain the desired result that \u0124 i (X, R) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 Z, so that \u03b2 i : \u0124 i (X, U (1)) \u2192\n\u0124 i+1 (X, Z) is an isomorphism for every i \u2208 Z. Thus, we can give a good topological definition\nof abelian p-gerbe for every p \u2208 Z, in such a way that there is a natural bijection between\nisomorphism classes of p-gerbes and elements of \u0124 i+1 (X, U(1)). In particular, considering\nthe remark after equation (16), we define:\nDefinition 3.1 For p < 0:\n\u2022 a p-gerbe with U(1)-band is a function f : X \u00d7 S \u2212p\u22121 \u2192 U(1) such that f |X\u00d7{p0} = 1;\n\u2022 an isomorphism between two p-gerbes f, g : X \u00d7 S \u2212p\u22121 \u2192 U(1) is a homotopy F :\nX \u00d7 S \u2212p\u22121 \u00d7 I \u2192 U(1) between f and g relative to X \u00d7 {p0 };\n\u2022 a p-gerbe is trivial if it is isomorphic to the constant function 1.\n4\n\nIn the following equalities involving homotopy groups, we use the fact that, for a topological group A,\nthe multiplication on \u03c0n (A, e), as a homotopy group, coincides with the pointwise multiplication of functions\nfrom (S n , \u2217) to (A, e), up to homotopy relative to \u2217 [7].\n\n12\n\n\fFor p = \u22121 the definition leads to a function f : X \u00d7 S 0 \u2192 U(1) such that f |X\u00d7{p0 } = 1, but,\nsince S 0 is the disjoint union of two points, one of which is p0 , such a function is equivalent\nto a function f : X \u2192 U(1) without restrictions, therefore we recover the previous definition.\nThe first Chern class of a p-gerbe with U(1)-band belongs to H i+2 (X, Z), and it completely\ndetermines the p-gerbe up to isomorphism. Actually, the previous definition can be easily\ngeneralized to the non-abelian case, replacing U(1) with U(n), and, via the suspension\nisomorphism, we can define the Chern classes and the Chern characters of a non-abelian\np-gerbe for p < 0. Moreover, there are non-trivial non-abelian p-gerbes for any p \u2208 Z. We\ndo not develop this topic further, since abelian gerbes are sufficient in order to describe\nRamond-Ramond fields. Let us now classify the isomorphism classes of abelian p-gerbes for\np \u2264 \u22121:\n\u2022 For p = \u22121, as we have already said, isomorphism classes of (\u22121)-gerbes are homotopy\nclasses of functions with value in U(1), classified by H 1 (X, Z).\n\u2022 For p = \u22122, isomorphism classes of (\u22122)-gerbes are elements of \u0124 \u22121 (X, U(1)), i.e.\nhomotopies between 1 : X \u2192 U(1) and itself, up to homotopy relative to X \u00d7 {0, 1}.\nThey are classified by H 0 (X, Z), which is isomorphic to Z for X connected. What is\nthe explicit correspondence between classes of homotopies from 1 to itself and Z, i.e.\nthe Bockstein map \u03b2 (\u22121) ? Given a representative f , we lift it from U(1) to R: we\nobtain a homotopy between 1 and another lifting of 1 in R, which is an integer number\nn \u2208 Z. It is easy to see from the theory of coverings [5] that n depends only on the\nhomotopy class of f relative to the boundary, so that we obtain a well defined map\n\u03b2 (\u22121) f = n.\n\u2022 Since abelian p-gerbes are classified by H p+2(X, Z), any p-gerbe for p \u2264 \u22123 is trivial.\nWe thus obtain a picture suitable for type II superstring theory. In fact, as we have discussed\nin section 2, we need non-trivial p-gerbes exactly for p \u2265 \u22122, and it is what naturally comes\nfrom the definition of hat-cohomology.\n\n4\n\nDifferential geometry and hat-cohomology\n\nUp to now we have discussed only the topology of p-gerbes via hat-cohomology. We now\nstudy their differential geometry, discussing connections with associated curvature and holonomy.\n\n4.1\n\nConnections, holonomy and curvature\n\nFor p \u2265 0 a p-gerbe with connection corresponds up to isomorphism to an element of the\nDeligne cohomology group \u021e p+1 (X, U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR ). Let us start with (\u22121)gerbes: according to this definition, a (\u22121)-gerbe with connection corresponds to an element\nof \u021e 0 (X, U(1)). This definition seems correct. In fact, as we have seen, a (\u22121)-gerbe is\na function with value in U(1), and its class up to isomorphism is the homotopy class of\nthe function. Considering that, for p \u2265 0, the local potentials defining a connection are\nreal-valued forms, and that the local potentials for p = \u22121 must be 0-forms, we can give the\nfollowing definition:\n13\n\n\fDefinition 4.1 The only connection on a (\u22121)-gerbe f : X \u2192 U(1) is the function C0 :\nX \u2192 R/Z such that f = e2\u03c0iC , which can be represented by local potentials (C0 )\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 R\nwith respect to a good cover U = {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I .\nThe holonomy of such a connection must be a well-defined function from the space of 0submanifolds of X to U(1). Since the connected 0-submanifolds are the points (and it is not\nrestrictive to consider connected submanifolds), the holonomy must be a function from X\nto U(1), i.e. the (\u22121)-gerbe f itself. Thus, the holonomy of a connection on a (\u22121)-gerbe is\nthe gerbe itself, or equivalently the choice of a representative within the isomorphism class.\nTwo homotopic functions are isomorphic as topological (\u22121)-gerbes, but not geometrically\nas gerbes with connection.\nLet us now discuss the curvature. For p \u2265 0 it is defined considering the highest degree\nforms of the connection and computing the exterior derivative. For (\u22121)-gerbes, this is\nequivalent to consider the differential dC0 for C0 : X \u2192 R/Z the connection. Since f =\n1\n1\ne2\u03c0iC0 , it follows that dC0 = 2\u03c0i\nd log f = 2\u03c0i\nf \u22121 df . This is consistent, since, if we consider\np+1\n1\nthe complex U (1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9R , the first boundary is d \u0303 = 2\u03c0i\nd\u25e6log instead of d, thus,\nby analogy with the case p \u2265 0, it is also natural to define the curvature of a (\u22121)-gerbe as\n \u0303 = 1 f \u22121 df . One can prove that the de-Rahm cohomology class [ 1 f \u22121 df ]dR corresponds\ndf\n2\u03c0i\n2\u03c0i\n1\nto c1 ([f ]) \u2297Z R under the standard isomorphism HdR\n(X) \u2243 H 1 (X, R).\nFor (\u22122)-gerbes there is no holonomy, since it should be defined on the space of (\u22121)submanifolds. For what concerns the curvature, it must be a closed integral 0-form, i.e. a\nconstant integral function F , such that [F ]dR \u2243 c1 (G) \u2297Z R. Since c1 (G) \u2208 \u0124 0 (X, Z) \u2243 Z,\nwe deduce that the curvature of a (\u22122)-gerbe is simply its first Chern class.\nRemark: It seems natural to extend the definition of hat-cohomology to the one of hathypercohomology, in order to describe connections and holonomies in this way. Actually,\nthis extension can be defined, but it gives no interesting information, therefore, in order to\ndeal with connections, it is better to use Deligne cohomology as we did up to now. The\ndetails can be found in the appendix B.\nFor example, if we start with the trivial background X = R1,9 , every function f : X \u2192\nU(1) is homotopic to the constant function 1, since the domain is contractible. Thus\n\u0124 0 (X, U (1)) = 0 as we expect, so that every (\u22121)-gerbe is topologically trivial; this also\nfollows from the fact that H 1 (X, Z) = 0 and \u0124 0 (X, U (1)) \u2243 H 1 (X, Z). A connection on\nthe trivial gerbe is determined by its holonomy C\u03030 : R1,9 \u2192 U(1). We can choose only one\npatch, coinciding with the whole X, and a unique Ramond-Ramond potential C0 : X \u2192 R\nup to global gauge transformations C0 \u2192 C0 + n with n \u2208 Z: then G1 = dC0 is the field\nstrength and C\u03030 = e2\u03c0iC0 is the holonomy. Thus, all the (\u22121)-gerbes are topologically trivial,\nand they are geometrically classified by a function C\u03030 : R1,9 \u2192 U(1), or, equivalently, by an\nequivalence class of functions C0 : X \u2192 R up to the addition of an integer.\nRemark: We see even in this trivial example that in the gauge transformations C0 \u2192 C0 +n\nof the 0-degree Ramond-Ramond potentials it is necessary to impose the constraint that\nn \u2208 Z, otherwise the holonomy C\u03030 = e2\u03c0iC0 , which is the path-integral measure corresponding\nto the Wess-Zumino action for a D(\u22121)-brane, should not be well-defined. This seems to\n14\n\n\fbe in contrast with the gauge transformations of the higher-order potentials, which are\nCp \u2192 Cp + d\u039bp\u22121, without integrality conditions. We will discuss later the reason of this\napparent inconsistency. \u0003\nIf we compactify one dimension, so that X = R1,8 \u00d7 U(1), since X retracts on U(1), the\nhomotopy classes of functions f : X \u2192 U(1) coincide with the homotopy classes of functions\n\u03c6 : U(1) \u2192 U(1), in particular the class of f corresponds to the class of \u03c6 defined by\n\u03c6(u) := f (0, u). Thus \u0124 0 (X, U(1)) \u2243 \u03c01 (U(1)) \u2243 Z: this also follows from the fact that\nH 1 (X, Z) \u2243 Z and \u0124 0 (X, U(1)) \u2243 H 1 (X, Z). It is easy to find one representative for each\nequivalence class in \u0124 0 (X, U (1)): for n \u2208 Z, we consider the function C\u03030 (x, z) = z n , whose\nclass corresponds to n under the isomorphism \u0124 0 (X, U (1)) \u2243 \u03c01 (U(1)) \u2243 Z, as the reader\ncan verify. This classifies the (\u22121)-gerbes topologically. For a given superstring background,\nwith local Ramond-Ramond potentials (C0 )\u03b1 with respect to a fixed cover, one considers the\nglobally defined function C\u03030 = e2\u03c0i(C0 )\u03b1 , which is both the connection and the holonomy, that\nclassifies the (\u22121)-gerbe geometrically. Then, to catch the topological information, which is\nthe equivalence class up to homotopy, one computes the first Chern class as shown above: if\nthe latter corresponds to n under the isomorphism H 1 (X, Z) \u2243 Z, then the given C\u03030 will be\nhomotopic to f (x, z) = z n .\nIf we compactify two dimensions, so that X = R1,7 \u00d7 T 2 , we get that \u0124 0 (X, U (1)) \u2243\n1\nH (X, Z) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z, thus the (\u22121)-gerbes are topologically classified by this group. One\nrepresentative of the class corresponding to (n, m) \u2208 Z \u2295 Z is C\u03030 (x, z, w) = z n w m for x \u2208\nR1,7 and z, w \u2208 U(1). For other backgrounds the way of arguing is the same, considering\nthe topology of the internal manifold when computing the cohomology groups or finding a\nsuitable good cover for the local potentials.\n\n4.2\n\nFlat connections\n\nFor a p-gerbe with p \u2265 0, a connection is flat when its curvature is 0. In this case, the\nholonomy is quantized and, for p \u2265 0, flat p-gerbes are classified by H p+1(X, U(1)), for U(1)\nthe constant sheaf. What happens for (\u22121)-gerbes? They are classified by H 0 (X, U(1)),\ni.e. by locally constant functions f : X \u2192 U(1). This is correct since, for a function\n1\nf : X \u2192 U(1) thought of as (\u22121)-gerbe with connection, the curvature 2\u03c0i\nf \u22121 df is zero if\nand only if df = 0, i.e. f is locally constant. In this case the holonomy, which is f itself,\nis quantized and depends only on the connected component of the domain. We can make a\nremark: any locally constant function is homotopic to 1, since U(1) is pathwise connected\n(to realize a homotopy it is enough to consider for each component a path in U(1) from the\nvalue of f to 1). Thus, any flat (\u22121)-gerbe is topologically trivial. In particular, H 1 (X, Z)\ncannot have torsion. This is a topological fact: the more general way to prove it is to\nuse universal coefficient theorem [5], which implies that H 1 (X, Z) \u2243 Hom(H1 (X, Z), Z), so\nthat it cannot have torsion. But we can prove it also in a more concrete way. In fact,\nsince H i (X, R) \u2243 H i (X, Z) \u2297Z R, it follows that H i (X, Z) has no torsion if and only if the\nnatural map \u03b9 : H i (X, Z) \u2192 H i (X, R) is injective. We have a long exact sequence in \u010cech\ncohomology of constant sheaves:\n\u021e 0 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 0 (X, R) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 0 (X, U(1)) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 1 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 1 (X, R)\n15\n\n\fwhich is isomorphic to:\nexp\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b9\n\nZ \u2212\u2192 R \u2212\u2192 U(1) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 1 (X, Z) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 1 (X, R).\nThe map exp is surjective, thus, by exactness, \u03b2 = 0 and, again by exactness, \u03b9 is injective.\nAny flat (\u22121)-gerbe is topologically trivial, and, in fact, it can be represented by a global\nconstant function f , i.e. it can always be lifted to a globally defined potential belonging to\n\u021e 0 (X, R).\nFor (\u22122)-gerbes the situation is very simple. Since they are classified by Z, the only flat\ngerbe is the trivial one. Since the curvature completely determines the gerbe, this is not a\nsurprise.\n\n4.3\n\nGauge transformations of C0\n\nFor the gauge transformations of C0 , which we write as (C0 )\u03b1 \u2212(C0 )\u03b2 = n\u03b1\u03b2 , one must impose\nn\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z, otherwise the holonomy C\u03030 = e2\u03c0iC0 is not a well-defined function. Let us consider\nthe gauge transformations of the highest degree potentials for p \u2265 0: they are of the form\n(Cp+1 )\u03b1 \u2212(Cp+1 )\u03b2 = d(Cp\u2032 )\u03b1\u03b2 . One can ask why the condition on the transition forms is to be\nintegral when the degree is 0 and to be exact for higher degrees. It seems an unnatural jump.\nActually, this can be understood considering the so-called large gauge transformations. Let\nus consider a cover U = {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I which is not a good cover. In particular, let us suppose\nthat the open sets U\u03b1 are contractible, but that there exists a double intersection U\u03b1\u03b2 such\nthat Hp+1 (U\u03b1\u03b2 , Z) 6= 0. In this case:\n(Gp+2 )|U\u03b1 = d(Cp+1)\u03b1\n\u0001\nd (Cp+1)\u03b1 \u2212 (Cp+1 )\u03b2 = 0\n\nbut we cannot deduce that the form (\u039bp+1)\u03b1\u03b2 := (Cp+1)\u03b1 \u2212(Cp+1 )\u03b2 is exact on U\u03b1\u03b2 . Let us see\nthat nature of (\u039bp+1)\u03b1\u03b2 . We can consider a non-trivial (p + 1)-cycle \u0393p+1 \u2282 U\u03b1\u03b2 . Then, since\nU\u03b1 and U\u03b2 are contractible, we can find two (p + 1)-chains (\u0393p+2 )\u03b1 \u2282 U\u03b1 and (\u0393p+2 )\u03b2 \u2282 U\u03b2\nsuch that \u2202(\u0393p+2 )\u03b1 = \u0393p+1 and \u2202(\u0393p+2 )\u03b2 = \u2212\u0393p+1\nR . Hence, \u0393p+2 = (\u0393p+2)\u03b1 \u222a (\u0393p+2 )\u03b2 is a\n(p + 2)-cycle in U\u03b1 \u222a U\u03b2 . Since Gp+2 is integral, \u0393p+2 Gp+2 \u2208 Z. But the following identity\nholds:\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd(Cp+1 )\u03b1 +\nd(Cp+1)\u03b2\nGp+2 =\n(\u0393p+2 )\u03b2\n(\u0393p+2 )\u03b1\n\u0393p+2\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n(\u039bp+1 )\u03b1\u03b2\n(Cp+1 )\u03b1 \u2212 (Cp+1 )\u03b2 =\n=\n\u0393p+1\n\n\u0393p+1\n\ntherefore:\n\nZ\n\n(\u039bp+1)\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z.\n\n\u0393p+1\n\nThis implies that (\u039bp+1)\u03b1\u03b2 is an integral form. These kind of gauge transformations, involving\nnon-trivial open subsets, are large gauge transformations. Actually, we can argue in this\nway only for a cycle \u0393p+1 which, although non-trivial in U\u03b1\u03b2 , is trivial on the whole space,\notherwise it cannot be contained in the contractible chart U\u03b1 or U\u03b2 . In general it is anyway\n16\n\n\ftrue that (\u039bp+1 )\u03b1\u03b2 must be integral, otherwise the holonomy along \u0393p+1 would not be welldefined:R in fact, being \u0393p+1 contained\nin the charts U\u03b1 and U\u03b2 , the holonomy can be defined\nR\nas exp( \u0393p+1 (Cp+1 )\u03b1 ) or exp( \u0393p+1 (Cp+1 )\u03b2 ), and the difference must be zero.\nWe have thus shown that, for large gauge transformations, the variation is an integral\nform. If we work with a good cover, as usually happens for smooth manifolds, there are\nno large gauge transformations. Since the cohomology of a contractible set is trivial at any\nnon-zero degree, and since all of the integral forms must be closed, it follows that the only\nintegral forms are the exact ones. Instead, only in degree 0 there is a non-trivial cohomology\ngroup for contractible sets, in particular constant integral functions are integral non-exact\n0-forms, and this explains the apparent difference between the transition functions of C0 and\nthe one of higher degree potentials for good covers.\n\n4.4\n\nDirac quantization condition in low degree\n\nLet us analyze the meaning of the Dirac quantization condition for (\u22121)-gerbes and (\u22122)gerbes. We briefly recall what happens for p = 0, the case p > 0 being entirely analogous.\nWe consider a closed 2-form F on X, and a good cover U = {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I on X. We can now\napply Poincar\u00e9 lemma iteratively:\n\u2022 since dF = 0 and U\u03b1 is contractible, we can find local 1-forms {A\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I such that\nF |U\u03b1 = dA\u03b1 ;\n\u2022 since dA\u03b1 |U\u03b1\u03b2 = dA\u03b2 |U\u03b1\u03b2 , we can find local 0-forms f\u03b1\u03b2 such that A\u03b1 |U\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 A\u03b2 |U\u03b1\u03b2 =\ndf\u03b1\u03b2 ;\n\u2022 since d(f\u03b1\u03b2 +f\u03b2\u03b3 +f\u03b3\u03b1 ) = A\u03b1 \u2212A\u03b2 +A\u03b2 \u2212A\u03b3 +A\u03b3 \u2212A\u03b1 = 0, it follows that f\u03b1\u03b2 +f\u03b2\u03b3 +f\u03b3\u03b1 =\nf\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 constant.\n2\nIn this way realize the class [F ]dR \u2208 HdR\n(X) as a \u010cech cohomology class [{f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 }] \u2208 \u021e 2 (X, R).\n2\u03c0if\u03b1\u03b2\n, we obtain transition functions with values in U(1) such that\nIf we consider g\u03b1\u03b2 = e\ng\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03b2\u03b3 g\u03b3\u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 , with g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 constant. If g\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 1 they are transition functions of a line\nbundle L. In this case f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2208 Z so that they realize a class in \u021e 2 (X, Z) which is the\nfirst Chern class c1 (L). It follows that F is a curvature of the connection [{g\u03b1\u03b2 , \u2212A\u03b1 }] \u2208\n\u021e 1 (X, U (1) \u2192 \u03a91R ) and, as we have already said, c1 (L) \u2297Z R \u2243 [F ]dR . Only in this case\nholonomy is a well-defined function on the loop space of X. Vivecersa, for F integral we can\nalways choose f\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z. In fact, since [{f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 }] is integral, it follows that f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b4\u030c 2 {c\u03b1\u03b2 }\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith c\u03b1\u03b2 real constant. Hence, f\u03b1\u03b2\n= f\u03b1\u03b2 + c\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z, and, since df\u03b1\u03b2\n= df\u03b1\u03b2 , we can replace\n\u2032\nf\u03b1\u03b2 with f\u03b1\u03b2 . This proves that any integral form is the curvature of a connection on a line\nbundle.\n\nFor (\u22121)-gerbes, let us start from a closed 1-form F . Then:\n\u2022 since dF = 0 and U\u03b1 is contractible, we can find local functions {f\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I such that\nF |U\u03b1 = df\u03b1 ;\n\u2022 since df\u03b1 |U\u03b1\u03b2 = df\u03b2 |U\u03b1\u03b2 , it follows that f\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b2 = f\u03b1\u03b2 constant.\n\n17\n\n\fWe thus get that [F ]dR \u2243 [{f\u03b1\u03b2 }] \u2208 \u021e 1 (X, R). If we consider g\u03b1 = e2\u03c0if\u03b1 we obtain that\ng\u03b1\u22121 g\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2 constant. If g\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 we obtain a global function g : X \u2192 U(1), which is a\n(\u22121)-gerbe and coincides with its holonomy. This happens if and only if f\u03b1\u03b2 \u2208 Z, and in\n1 \u22121\nthis case [F ]dR is integral and F = 2\u03c0i\ng dg. Vicevesa one can prove that, for F integral,\n1 \u22121\nwe can always find g such that F = 2\u03c0i g dg. Thus, as for p \u2265 0, the Dirac quantization\ncondition is equivalent for the holonomy to be a globally defined function. In particular, this\nmeans that the Wess-Zumino action of a D-instanton has a well-defined exponential, the\nlatter being the path-integral measure: otherwise, on the intersection of two local charts,\nsuch an exponential should depend on the choice of the chart.\nSome comments are in order about the quantization of G0 . Such a field-strength arises\nfrom a D8-brane, with 9-dimensional world-volume, which breaks the space-time in two\ndisconnected components. The simplest example is a magnetic monopole in 0+1 space-time\ndimensions. In this case the space-time is R, and the magnetic monopole with charge q is\nfixed in the origin. Then, a linking manifold of the charge is the sphere S 0 , i.e. the disjoint\nunion of the two points \u22121 and 1. Therefore, the field-strength is a 0-form F , i.e. a function\nF : R \\ {0} \u2192 R. It must be closed, hence locally constant on R \\ {0}: this means that it\nassumes a constant value \u03b1+ on the set of positive numbers and a constant value \u03b1\u2212 on the\nset of negative numbers. Then:\nZ\nq=\nF = F (1) \u2212 F (\u22121) = \u03b1+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 ,\nS0\n\ntherefore the Dirac quantization conditions means in this case that \u03b1+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 \u2208 Z, up to\na normalization constant. It is not necessary that \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 are separately integral. In\n0\n(R \\ {0}) \u2243 R \u2295 R, it is not\nother words, considering the 0-degree de-Rham cohomology HdR\n0\nnecessary that F lies in the integral lattice H (R \\ {0}, Z) \u2243 Z \u2295 Z, but only in the subgroup\n{(\u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 ) | \u03b1+ \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 \u2208 Z}. In string theory, when we consider the field-strength G0 , we are\nconsidering a space-time which should be one of the two halves of a bigger space-time, which\nis split in two parts by a D8-brane. Therefore, it is not strictly necessary that G0 is integral:\nthis is true if we assume that, in the other half that we do not consider, it is set to 0.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown in this paper how to describe in a unitary way the geometry of RamondRamond field strengths and potentials, including the low-degree cases, and consequently the\ngeometry of D-brane charges and Wess-Zumino action including D-instantons. To achieve\nthis aim, we have introduced a variant of the ordinary \u010cech cohomology, which we have\ncalled hat-cohomology. With this language, we can define abelian p-gerbes with connection\nfor any p \u2208 Z:\n\u2022 topologically a p-gerbe up to isomorphism corresponds to an element of \u0124 p+1(X, U (1));\n\u2022 geometrically a p-gerbe with connection up to isomorphism corresponds to an element\nof \u021e p+1(X, U (1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR ).\n18\n\n\fIt follows that there exist non-trivial gerbes only for p \u2265 \u22122. The Ramond-Ramond field\nstrength Gp+2 is a curvature on a p-gerbe for p \u2265 \u22122, and the Ramond-Ramond potentials\nCp+1 are the local top-forms of a connection on the corresponding p-gerbe for p \u2265 \u22121.\nFor the case p = \u22121, the field strength is the integral 1-form G1 , whose holonomy\nis the globally defined function C\u03030 = e2\u03c0iC0 , where C0 : X \u2192 R/Z is the connection.\nThe topological data, i.e. the (\u22121)-gerbe up to isomorphism, is the equivalence class up to\nhomotopy [ C\u03030 ] \u2208 \u0124 0 (X, U (1)). The Dirac quantization condition for G1 is equivalent to the\nfact that C\u03030 is globally defined, i.e. that the Wess-Zumino action for a D-instanton:\nSW Z = q\u22121 * C0 (W Y\u22121 )\nhas a well-defined exponential, the latter being the path-integral measure.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is financially supported by FAPESP (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado\nde S\u00e3o Paulo).\n\nA\n\nChern class of a function\n\nWe prove the following lemma, which was stated in subsection 2.3.\nLemma A.1 Let us give to S 1 \u2282 C the counter-clockwise orientation, so that we fix an\noriented generator 1 \u2208 H 1 (S 1 , Z) \u2243 Z. Then, for f : X \u2192 S 1 :\nc1 (f ) = f \u2217 (1) .\n2\n\nProof: For w = e 3 i\u03c0 , let us consider the three points 1, w, w 2 \u2208 S 1 . We consider on S 1\nthe good cover U = {U0 , U1 , U2 } where U0 = {e2\u03c0i\u03b8 | 0 < \u03b8 < 32 }, U1 = {e2\u03c0i\u03b8 | 31 < \u03b8 < 1}\nand U2 = {e2\u03c0i\u03b8 | 32 < \u03b8 < 43 }: in this way, orienting S 1 counterclockwise, U0 = (1, w 2 ) and\nw \u2208 U0 , U1 = (w, 1) and w 2 \u2208 U1 , U2 = (w 2 , w) and 1 \u2208 U0 . We now compute the \u010cech\ncohomology of Z with respect to U. The double intersections are U01 , U12 and U02 , and there\nare no higher-order intersections. Thus:\n\u010c 0 (U, Z) = Z \u2295 Z \u2295 Z\n\u010c 1 (U, Z) = Z \u2295 Z \u2295 Z\n\u010c i (U, Z) = 0 \u2200i \u2265 2\n\u03b4\u030c 0 (a, b, c) = (b \u2212 a, c \u2212 a, c \u2212 b)\n\u03b4\u030c i = 0 \u2200i \u2265 1 .\nDenoting with \u017d the cocycles and with B\u030c the coboundaries, it follows that \u017d 1 (U, Z) =\n\u010c 1 (U, Z), while B\u030c 1 (U, Z) = {(n, m, m \u2212 n)}. Thus, in cohomology of degree 1, [(n, m, s)] =\n[(n, m, s)\u2212(n, m, m\u2212n)] = [(0, 0, s\u2212m+n)], thus every cohomology class can be represented\nas [(0, 0, k)]. Moreover, [(0, 0, k)] = [(0, 0, h)] if and only if k = h. Thus the isomorphism\n\u021e 1 (X, Z) \u2243 Z can be expressed as [(0, 0, k)] \u2243 k.\n19\n\n\fThe cohomology class 1 is thus represented as [(0, 0, 1)], thus, if we consider in X the open\ncover f \u22121 U = {f \u22121 U0 , f \u22121U1 , f \u22121 U2 }, the cohomology class f \u2217 1 \u2208 \u021e 1(X, Z) is represented\nby the cocycle with value 1 on f \u22121 U02 and 0 on f \u22121 U01 and f \u22121 U12 . Let us show that this\nclass corresponds to c1 (f ). In fact, let us choose the logarithms of f accordingly to the\ndefinition of U0 , U1 and U2 : we define f |f \u22121 U0 = e2\u03c0i\u03c10 with 0 < \u03c10 (x) < 23 for every x \u2208 U0 ,\nand similarly for \u03c11 and \u03c12 . We now see that in the definition of U0 and U1 the angle \u03b8 agrees\non U01 , and the same for U12 , while there is a difference of 1 on U02 . Thus, \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 = 0 and\n\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 = 0, while \u03c11 \u2212 \u03c12 = 1. That's why c1 (f ), computed via \u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1j , agrees with the\npull-back of [(0, 0, 1)], which is the class 1 in \u021e 1 (S 1 , Z). \u0003\n\nB\n\nHat-hypercohomology\n\nIt seems natural to extend the definition of hat-cohomology to the one of hat-hypercohomology,\nin order to describe connections and holonomies in this way. Actually, we show that the extension can be defined, but it gives no interesting information, therefore, in order to deal\nwith connections, it is better to use Deligne cohomology as we did up to now.\nWe can apply the general definition of hat-cohomology, given in subsection 3.2, to the\nsheaves of differential forms of a fixed degree on a manifold X. What are the cohomology\ngroups \u0124 \u2217(X, \u03a9pR )? The case is analogous to the one of the sheaf R = \u03a90R . In fact, since \u03a9pR\nadmits partitions of unity, it is acyclic, i.e. \u021e i (X, \u03a9pR ) = 0 \u2200i 6= 0. Thus, in \u010cech cohomology,\nthe only non-trivial group is \u021e 0 (X, \u03a9pR ), which is made by p-forms globally defined on X.\nWe now show that, in hat-cohomology, \u0124 0(X, \u03a9pR ) = 0 \u2200i \u2208 Z. In fact, e.g. for i = 0, it\nfollows from the definition that:\n\u0124 0 (X, \u03a9pR ) \u2243 \u021e 0 (X, \u03a9pR ) / homotopy,\nwhere a homotopy between two global forms is a path joining them. Actually, any p-form \u03c9\nis homotopic to zero, thanks to the following homotopy:\n\u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 \u039bp T \u2217 X\n\u03c6(t)(X1 , . . . , Xp ) := t * \u03c9x (X1 , . . . , Xp ).\nIt is easy to see that i\u22170 \u03a9 = 0 and i\u22171 \u03a9 = \u03c9, thus \u03a9 is a homotopy between \u03c9 and 0.\nAnalogous considerations show that \u0124 \u2212i (X, \u03a9pR ) = 0 for any i \u2208 N. In fact, given a cocycle\n\u03c6 : I i \u2192 \u039bp T \u2217 X, with \u03c6|J i = 0, it holds that \u03c6 = \u03b4\u0302 \u2212i\u22121 \u03a6 for \u03a6 homotopy between \u03c6 and 0\nrelative to the boundary.\nLet us now study the hypercohomology corresponding to the hat-cohomology. The hatdouble-complex associated to the complex of sheaves:\nd \u0303\n\nd\n\nd\n\nU (1) \u2212\u2192 \u03a91R \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR\n\n20\n\n\fwith respect to a good cover U is:\n***\n/\n\n\u0108 \u22121 (U, \u03a9p+1\nR )\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u22121\n\n/\n\n\u0108 0 (U, \u03a9p+1\nR )\n\nd\n\u03b4\u0302\u22121\n\nd\n\u03b4\u03020\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u22121\n\n/\n\n***\n\nO\nd \u0303\n\n\u0108 0 (U, U (1))\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03021\n\n\u0108 1 (U, \u03a91R )\n/\n\nd \u0303\n\n\u0108 \u22121 (U, U (1))\n\n***\n\n..\n.O\n\nO\n\nd \u0303\n\n/\n\nd\n\n\u0108 0 (U, \u03a91R )\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03021\n\nO\n\nd\n\n/ \u0108 \u22121 (U, \u03a91 )\nR\nO\n\n/\n\n\u0108 1 (U, \u03a9p+1\nR )\n\n..\n.O\n\n..\n.O\n\n***\n\n/\n\nd\n\nd\n\n***\n\n\u03b4\u03020\n\nO\nO\n\n\u03b4\u03020\n\n\u0108 1 (U, U(1))\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03021\n\n***\n/\n\nIt is infinite on the left and on the right. Let us compute \u0124 p+1(X, U (1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\nR ).\nWe consider for simplicity the case of line bundles, the others are analogous. Thus the\ncomplex is:\n/ \u0108 \u22121 (U, \u03a91 )\nR\nO\n\n***\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u22121\n\n/\n\n\u0108 0 (U, \u03a91R )\n\nd \u0303\n\n***\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03020\n\n/\n\n\u0108 1 (U, \u03a91R )\n\nO\nd \u0303\n\n\u0108 \u22121 (U, U (1))\n\n\u03b4\u0302\u22121\n\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03021\n\n/\n\n***\n\nO\nd \u0303\n\n\u0108 0 (U, U (1))\n\n\u03b4\u03020\n\n/\n\n\u03b4\u03021\n\n\u0108 1 (U, U(1))\n\n/\n\n***\n\nand the 1-cochains are the same as for \u010cech hypercohomlogy, i.e. \u0108 1 (U, U (1)) \u2295 \u0108 0 (U, \u03a91R ),\nwhich is equal by definition to \u010c 1 (U, U (1))\u2295 \u010c 0 (U, \u03a91R ). Since also the coboundaries are equal\nfor non-negative degrees, the cocycles are the same: they are of the form {g\u03b1\u03b2 , \u2212A\u03b1 } with\n1\ng\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03b2\u03b3 g\u03b3\u03b1 = 1 and A\u03b1 \u2212 A\u03b2 = 2\u03c0i\nd log g\u03b1\u03b2 . The difference can be seen in the coboundaries:\nthere are the usual coboundaries coming from the cochains in \u0108 0 (U, U (1)), but there are\nalso the coboundaries coming from cochains in \u0108 \u22121 (U, \u03a91R ). Thus the general coboundary\n1\nis of the form \u03b4({g\u03b1 }, \u03c6) = ({g\u03b1\u22121 g\u03b2 , 2\u03c0i\nd log g\u03b1 + \u03c6(1)}, for \u03c6 : I \u2192 T \u2217 X. This means\nthat there are new coboundaries of the form (1, A) for A a globally-defined 1-form: but\nthese are exactly the topologically trivial line bundles, with any connection. Thus, the\ncohomology class contains information only about the topology of the line bundle, i.e. there\nis an isomorphism \u0124 1 (X, U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R ) \u2243 \u0124 1 (X, U(1)). For higher degrees the situation is\nanalogous. In degree \u22121 it is even clearer since the double-complex has only one line and it\nreduces to the hat-complex, thus we get exactly \u0124 0 (X, U (1)). Thus, in general:\np+1\n\u0124 p+1 (X, U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 * * * \u2192 \u03a9p+1\n(X, U(1)) \u2200p \u2265 \u22121 .\nR ) \u2243 \u0124\n\nFor i \u2264 \u22122 the double complex is the 0-complex, thus, for i \u2264 \u22123, the isomorphism still\nholds, but not for i = \u22122, since \u0124 \u22121 (X, U(1)) \u2243 Z. Actually, one can also consider the\ninfinite complex of sheaves:\nd \u0303\n\nd\n\nd\n\nU(1) \u2212\u2192 \u03a91R \u2212\u2192 \u03a92R \u2212\u2192 * * *\nand prove in the same way that:\n\u0124 p+1 (X, U(1) \u2192 \u03a91R \u2192 \u03a92R \u2192 * * * ) \u2243 \u0124 p+1(X, U (1)) \u2200p \u2208 Z .\nNow the isomorphism holds also for p = \u22122.\n21\n\n\fReferences\n[1] L.
