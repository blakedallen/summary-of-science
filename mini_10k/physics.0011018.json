This suggests a\nreconsideration of no-slip boundary conditions, in which the vanishing of\nthe tangential velocity at a no-slip wall is replaced by a local wall-friction\nterm in the equation of motion.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt has long been the case that pressure determinations for incompressible flows,\nboth Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), are known to be highly\n\n1\n\n\fnon-local. Taking the divergence of the equation of motion\n\u2202v\nj\u00d7B\n+ v * \u2207v =\n\u2212 \u2207P + \u03bd\u22072 v,\n\u2202t\n\u03c1c\n\n(1)\n\nand using \u2207 * v = 0 leaves us with a Poisson equation for the pressure P , which\nis said to function as an equation of state:\n\u22072 P = \u2212\u2207 * (v * \u2207v \u2212\n\nj\u00d7B\n)\n\u03c1c\n\n(2)\n\nHere, v = v(x, t) is the fluid velocity field as a function of position and time, B is\nthe magnetic field, j = c\u2207\u00d7B/4\u03c0 is the electric current density, c is the speed of\nlight, \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity, assumed spatially uniform and constant, and\nP is the pressure normalized to \u03c1 the mass density, also spatially uniform. (1)\nand (2) are written for MHD. Their Navier-Stokes equivalents can be obtained\nsimply by dropping the terms containing B and j.\nIf we are to solve (2) for P , boundary conditions are required. In the immediate neighborhood of a stationary \"no-slip\" boundary, both the terms on\nthe left of (1) vanish and we are left with the following equation for \u2207P as a\nboundary condition:\nj\u00d7B\n(3)\n\u2207P = \u03bd\u22072 v +\n\u03c1c\nWe now focus on the Navier-Stokes case, where the magnetic terms disappear from (3), for simplicity. All the complications of MHD are illustrated\nby this simpler case. It is apparent that (3) must apply to all components of\n\u2207P , and that while the normal component of \u2207P is enough to determine P\nthrough Neumann boundary conditions, the tangential components of (3) at\nthe wall equally well determine P through Dirichlet boundary conditions. This\nis a problem which some inventive procedures have been proposed to resolve,\nusually by some degree of \"pre-processing\" or various dynamical recipes which\nseem to lead to approximately no-slip velocity fields after a few time steps (e.g.\n[Gresho 1991], [Roache 1982] and [Canuto et al. 1988] ). It is not our purpose\nto review or critique these recipes, but rather to focus on a set of velocity fields,\nrelated to Chandrasekhar-Reid functions [Chandrasekhar 1961], for which (2)\nis explicitly soluble at a level where the Neumann or Dirichlet conditions can\nbe exactly implemented. In \u00a7 2, we explore the difference between the two pressures so arrived at. Then in \u00a7 3, we propose a replacement for the long-standing\npractice of demanding that all components of a solenoidal v vanish at material\nwalls, in favor of a replacement by a wall friction term for which the above\nmathematical difficulty is no longer present. Of course, similar statements and\noptions will apply to all comparable incompressible MHD problems.\n\n2\n\nPressure determinations\n\nRestricting attention at present to the Navier-Stokes case, we consider twodimen- sional, solenoidal, velocity fields obtained from the following stream\n2\n\n\ffunction:\n\u03c8(x, y) = Ck\u03bb cos (kx)[cos (\u03bby) + Ak\u03bb cosh (ky)]\n\n(4)\n\nThe hyperbolic cosine term in (4) contributes a potential flow velocity component to v which makes it possible to demand that v obey two boundary conditions: the vanishing of both components at rigid walls [Chandrasekhar 1961].\nThe function in (4) is even in x and y, but can obviously be converted into an\nodd or mixed one by the appropriate trigonometric substitutions.\nThe velocity field v = \u2207\u03c8\u00d7\u00eaz has only x and y components and is periodic\nin x, with an arbitrary wavenumber k. Ck\u03bb is a normalizing constant, and the\nconstants \u03bb and Ak\u03bb can systematically be found numerically to any desired\naccuracy so that both components of v vanish at symmetrically placed no-slip\nwalls at y = a and y = \u2212a. In fact, for given k, an infinite sequence of such\npairs of \u03bb and Ak\u03bb can be determined straightforwardly. Thus any such v,\nor superposition thereof, is not only solenoidal, but has both components zero\nat y = \u00b1a, and all spatial derivatives exist. Moreover, the \"source\" term, or\n\u2207 * (v * \u2207v), from the right hand side of (2), is of a relatively simple nature for\nsuch a v, since every term in it can be written as a product of exponentials of\nkx, \u03bby and ky. It is straightforward to find an inhomogeneous solution for P ,\nwhich then is the same for all boundary conditions for a given v of the form\nstated. To this inhomogeneous part of P must be added a solution of Laplace's\nequation. This can be chosen so that the total P may satisfy either the normal\ncomponent of (3) at the walls, or the tangential component of it, but not both.\nThe determination involves only simple but tedious algebra.\nWe illustrate, in figure 1, an arrow plot of the velocity field given by choosing\nk = \u03c0/2, \u03bb = 2.6424 and Ak\u03bb = .3499, in units of a = 1. The two pressures resulting from the satisfaction of the normal and tangential components of (3) can\nbest be compared by comparing their respective values of \u2207P , since P itself is\nindeterminate up to an additive constant in both cases. In figure 2, we display, as\nan arrow plot, the difference between the pressure gradients associated with the\nvelocity field shown in figure 1. We have rewritten (1)-(3) in dimensionless units\nfor this purpose, with the kinematic viscosity being replaced by the reciprocal of\na Reynolds number, which may be defined as Re = (hv2 i/(k 2 + \u03bb2 ))1/2 /\u03bd. Here,\nthe angle brackets refer to the mean of v2 taken over the 2-D box, containing\none period in the x direction and from y = \u2212a to y = a. The value of Re used to\nconstruct figure 2 is Re = 2293, with the dimensionless version of Ck\u03bb = 5000\nin (4). The two pressures are similar but not identical.\nIn figure 3, a fractional measure of the difference between the \"Neumann\npressure\" PN and the \"Dirichlet pressure\" PD is exhibited as a contour plot of\nthe scalar ratio\n(\u2207PD \u2212 \u2207PN )2\n(5)\nh(\u2207PN )2 i\nThere is no absolute significance to the numerical value of this ratio. It initially\nincreases with Re approaching a maximum of about 2% near the wall for Re >\n\u223c\n10. It is considered interesting however, that the fractional difference is nearly\nx-independent where it is largest. That occurs formally because the algebra\n3\n\n\f1\n8\n6\n4\n\nY\n\n2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nX\nFigure 1: Velocity field: v = \u2207\u03c8\u00d7\u00eaz using \u03c8 from (4) with k = \u03c0/2, \u03bb = 2.6424\nand Ak\u03bb = .3499\n\nreveals it to be dominated by a term which varies as cosh (4ky) \u2212 cos (4kx) in a\nregion where ky >\n\u223c 1.\nIt is amusing but perhaps not significant to superpose the velocity field from\n(4) with a parabolic plane Poiseuille flow of a larger amplitude. The resulting\nflow field is shown in figure 4, and it bears a striking but perhaps not significant\nsimilarity to the flow patterns seen in two-dimensional plane Poiseuille flow\n[Jones & Montgomery 1994] when linear stability thresholds are approached.\nThe pressure gradient difference for this case will be fractionally smaller than\nin figure 3, since pure parabolic plane Poiseuille flow is a rare case where the\ntwo pressures happen to agree, and it quantitatively dominates the pressures\ndetermined from equation (2) in this example.\n\n3\n\nDiscussion and a possible modification\n\nAn alternative to the no-slip condition is the \"Navier\" boundary condition\n[Lamb 1932]: the slip velocity at the wall surface is taken to be proportional to\nthe rate of shear at the wall. This may be expressed \u2206V = Ls \u03b3\u0307 where \u2206V is the\nslip velocity of the fluid at the wall, \u03b3\u0307 is the rate of shear at the wall and Ls is a\n\n4\n\n\fgrad PN \u2212 grad PD\n1\n8\n6\n4\n\nY\n\n2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.8\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nX\n\nFigure 2: The difference between pressure gradients: \u2207PN \u2212 \u2207PD with Re =\n2293\n\nconstant with the dimensions length. Molecular dynamic simulations of Newtonian liquids under shear [Thompson & Robbins 1990] have shown this to be the\ncase under some circumstances. In fact recent work [Thompson & Troian 1997]\nhas shown that, in cases where the shear rate is large, there is a nonlinear\nrelationship between Ls and \u03b3\u0307.\nWe note that the velocity field shown in figure 1 does not lead to one which\nobeys the Navier boundary condition, after an initial time step, where the fluid\nhas been allowed to slip at the wall. If the velocity field determined by (4) is\nadvanced in time using (1) with the \"Neumann pressure\", the proportionality\nbetween the slip velocity and the rate of shear at the wall, after the initial time\nstep, varies sinusoidally with x.\nIt is to be stressed that we are concerned here only with initial conditions,\nnot with circumstances under which initial slip velocities might be coaxed dynamically into vanishing after some time.\nIt is difficult to see in what sense the velocity field obtained from (4) might\nbe an unacceptable one from the point of view of the Navier-Stokes or MHD\ndescriptions. It seems to have all the properties that are thought to be relevant. The family of functions of the same x-periodicity in (4) can be shown\nto be orthogonal, and is a candidate for a complete set, in which any v might\n\n5\n\n\f2\n\n( grad P \u2212 grad P )\nD\n\n1\n\nN\n\n0.021\n\n/ ( mean square grad P )\nN\n\n0.017\n\n0.013\n0.009\n\n0.8\n\n0.005\n\n0.6\n0.001\n\n0.4\n\nY\n\n0.2\n0\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\n0.001\n\n\u22120.6\n0.005\n\n\u22120.8\n\n0.009\n0.013\n\n0.017\n\n\u22121.6\n\n0.021\n\n\u22121.2\n\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\nX\n\nFigure 3: Normalized mean square pressure gradient difference: (\u2207PD \u2212\n\u2207PN )2 /h(\u2207PN )2 i with Re = 2293.

The\nmathematical question of which if any velocity fields, which are both solenoidal\nand vanish at the wall, would lead to Neumann and Dirichlet pressures that\nwere in agreement with each other, must remain open. Indeed, the question of\nwhether there are any, without some degree of \"pre-processing,\" must remain\nopen. This is an unsatisfactory situation for fluid mechanics and MHD, in our\nopinion, even if it is a not unfamiliar one. The search for alternatives seems\nmandatory.\nOne alternative that may be explored is one that seemed some time ago, in\na rather different context [Shan & Montgomery 1994a,b], to have worked well\nenough for MHD. Namely, we may think of replacing the requirement of the\nvanishing of the tangential velocity at a rigid wall with a wall friction term,\nadded to the right hand side of (1), of the form\n\u2212\n\nv\n\u03c4 (x)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the coefficient 1/\u03c4 (x) vanishes in the interior of the fluid and rises sharply\nto a large positive value near the wall.

Such a term provides a mechanism for momentum loss to the wall\nand constrains the tangential velocity to small values, but does not force it to\nzero. The Dirichlet boundary condition disappears in favor of a relation that\npermits the time evolution of the tangential components of v, while demanding\nthat P be determined solely by the Neumann condition (the normal component\nof (3) only). In a previous MHD application [Shan & Montgomery 1994a,b]\ndealing with rotating MHD fluids, the scheme seemed to perform acceptably\nwell, but was not intensively tested or benchmarked sharply against any of the\nbetter understood Navier-Stokes flows. This comparison seems worthy of future\nattention.\nThe work of one of us (D.C.M.) was supported by hospitality in the Fluid\nDynamics Laboratory at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
