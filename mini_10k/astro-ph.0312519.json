These studies have advanced our understanding of how galaxies evolved\ntowards the present epoch (Gallego et al. 1995; Madau et al. 1996; Lilly et al. 1996;\n1\n\nInstitute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa 277 8582, Japan\n\n2\n\nApache Point Observatory, Sunspot, NM 88349, U. S. A.\n\n3\n\nDepartment of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802,\nU. S. A.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nTreyer et al. 1998; Tresse & Maddox 1998; Steidel et al. 1999; Glazebrook et al. 1999;\nSullivan et al. 2000; Tresse et al. 2002). Despite its obvious importance, the estimate of\nthe star formation rate at zero redshift, which is the boundary value for the star formation\nhistory, still largely relies on the pioneering work of Gallego et al. (1995) which was based\non Schmidt objective prism plates searching for strong H\u03b1 emission galaxies with observed\nequivalent widths EW(H\u03b1+[NII])>10\u00c5. The evolution of galaxies is inferred by comparing\nthe global star formation rates at higher redshift with Gallego et al.'s value at z \u2248 0. Radio\ninvestigations have suggested star formation rates higher than Gallego et al.'s by a factor\nof two (Cram 1998; Serjeant, Gruppioni & Oliver 2002). The follow-up work for Gallego et\nal.'s sample by Gil de Paz et al. (2000) gave valuable information as to the nature of star\nforming galaxies, yet the question of when galaxies show star formation activity among their\nentire population remains uncovered. Also a poorly understood aspect is the star formation\nactivity as a function of morphology of galaxies, which constitutes another dimension of\ngalaxy formation.\nIn fact, there are a few pieces of work which studied the star formation rate as a function\nof morphologies of galaxies (Kennicutt & Kent 1983; Ryder & Dopita 1994; hereinafter\nRD94). These studies, however, were based on nearby galaxy samples, which were preselected\nby choice, while ideally one want to study homogeneous galaxy samples. The primary\ndifficulty of this approach for nearby galaxies is to obtain accurate spectroscopic information\nfor a homogeneous galaxy sample over a large area of the sky. The Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) overcome this difficulty with its spectroscopic data for a\nlarge number of homogeneously selected galaxies. The SDSS data also allow significantly\nmore accurate treatments as to the control over selection effects, such as those expected in\nline-selected samples, and systematic errors arising from stellar absorption, extinction, and\ncontamination from AGN.\nIn this paper we use the optically-selected and morphology-classified bright galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for the northern equatorial stripe. The sample is\nflux-limited with r \u2217 \u2264 15.9 mag after dereddening corrections, and morphological classification is given by visual inspections. This sample, with median redshift z = 0.05, has been\nused to derive luminosity functions (LF) of morphologically selected galaxies (Nakamura et\nal. 2003; hereinafter N03). The SDSS spectroscopy covers from 3900 to 9000 \u00c5 with the\nresolution of 2-5 \u00c5. Redshifts are identified and EWs are measured with the spectroscopic\npipeline. We use H\u03b1 as an indicator of star formation activity. The SDSS spectroscopy is\nsufficient to resolve H\u03b1 and [N II]\u03bb\u03bb6548,6583 doublet. The advantage of using H\u03b1 as the\nstar formation indicator is that this emission arises from the ionising flux that is produced\nby massive short-lived stars compared, for instance, to the indicators using the UV light at\n1500-2800\u00c5 which survives, or even increases, for a significant duration of time after stars\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nformed (e.g., Tresse & Maddox 1998; Glazebrook et al. 1999). Another advantage is that\nthe extinction correction is smaller and readily corrected for by using the Balmer line ratio.\nThis contrasts to UV emission, which suffers from large extinction but also an uncertainty\nin extinction laws (Calzetti et al. 1994). The most important disadvantage with the SDSS\nspectroscopy for our purpose is that it uses fibres of small apertures, and the aperture correction is essential. We circumvent this problem by using the empirical radial profile of H\u03b1\nobtained by RD94 to calculate the total H\u03b1 flux.\nOur prime purpose is to investigate the H\u03b1 emissivity distribution for each class of\nmorphological type of galaxies, and its contribution to global H\u03b1 luminosity in the nearby\nuniverse (z \u2264 0.12) using a well-defined optically flux-limited sample. We prefer to use\ntraditional morphological classification obtained by visual inspections, since spectroscopic or\ncolour indicators are too sensitive to small amounts of star formation activity, whereas visual\nmorphology reflects dynamical evolution of galaxies more faithfully. The drawback of this\napproach is the small size of the sample (1600 galaxies). Notwithstanding, we emphasise that\nthe present study is based on a galaxy sample with homogeneous morphological classification\nand accurate photometry; the resulting H\u03b1 emission sample is significantly larger than those\nused in previous studies.\nIn section 2 we describe the data and various corrections that are crucial to our study.\nThe H\u03b1 LF is derived in section 3 for each morphological class. A detailed comparison is\ngiven with the work of Gallego et al. (1995) for the total H\u03b1 luminosity density in this\nsection. Morphological-type and colour dependence of H\u03b1 emissivity is presented in section\n4, and implications of our results are discussed in section 5.\nWe adopt the cosmology \u03a9 = 0.3 and \u03bb = 0.7 throughout this paper, although the\nphysical parameters of our objects, being at such low redshift, depend little on \u03a90 and \u03bb0 .\nWe use the standard notation h = H0 /100km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 to demonstrate the dependence of\nquantities upon H0 .\n\n2.\n\nThe emission line galaxy sample\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nOur sample is derived from the photometric images (Gunn et al. 1998; Hogg et al.\n2001; Pier et al. 2003) of Run 752/756 of early SDSS observations [the area lies along the\ncelestial equator for 9h 40m 36s \u2264 \u03b1(J2000) \u2264 15h 43m 53s ]. The observations cover 229.7\ndeg2 in the five colour band photometric system (Fukugita et al. 1996), calibrated by the\nstandard star network established by the work at USNO (Smith et al. 2002). The bulk of\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndata were published in Early Data Release (Stoughton et al. 2002), and are also included in\nData Release One (DR1, Abazajian et al. 2003). Spectroscopic information is obtained for\ngalaxies that satisfy accurately defined selection criteria (Strauss et al. 2002; Blanton et al.\n2003b). The morphological classification was performed by visual inspections for all galaxies\nwith dereddened Petrosian magnitude of r \u2217 P \u2264 15.9 included in the rectangular area of Run\n752/7564. The morphological index T = 0 \u2212 6 is assigned to E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sc, Sd and Im.\nThe galaxies that show largely disturbed morphologies are given T = \u22121. The size of galaxy\nsample with spectroscopic information is 1600 (See Table 1 of N03).\nAmong 1600 galaxies, we drop 21 objects because of either low (< 85%) redshift confidence or misallocation of fibres to overlapping stars, 29 galaxies because of poor photometry\ndue to deblending of neighboring objects, and 59 galaxies that fall either z < 0.01 or z > 0.12.\nWe remove an additional 9 galaxies with r \u2217 P < 13.2, at which magnitude the spectroscopic\nsurvey completeness is lowered due to the SDSS target selection algorithms. These cuts leave\n1482 galaxies for our consideration. This data set is the same as the sample from which the\nmorphologically-dependent luminosity function was derived in N03 (sample 5 in Table 1 of\nN03), and is recapitulated in Table 1 below. These selections do not introduce any significant\nbias into the sample with respect to morphology or luminosity.\nThe SDSS spectroscopy was carried out using fibres of 3\u2032\u2032 diameter placed on the centre\nof each object with F/5 optics. The 2-5\u00c5 spectral resolution of the double spectrographs\nresolves H\u03b1 emission from [NII]\u03bb6548 and [NII]\u03bb6583. This contrasts to earlier works where\nH\u03b1 is often blended with nitrogen lines (e,g., Sullivan et al. 2000; Tresse & Maddox 1998).\nRedshifts and EWs are automatically measured by the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline and\nare catalogued. We use redshifts converted into the values in the Galactic standard of rest\naccording to de Vaucouleurs et al. (1991). There is little confusion in the measurement of\nH\u03b1 equivalent widths: visual inspection of spectra shows that emission lines with greater\nthan \u22480.5\u00c5 in the observed frame are accurately measured for the majority of galaxies.\nManual remeasurements of EWs for selected galaxies using IRAF show that the error is less\nthan 0.5\u00c5 for small EWs and less than 10% for larger EWs. The error mostly arises from\nthe fit to the continuum. We shall work with the rest-frame equivalent width (hereafter we\nalways refer to the rest-frame EW unless otherwise noted) with measurements at more than\n2.5\u03c3. A total of 30 galaxies have EW\u2265 1\u00c5 yet the detection confidence is less than 2.5\u03c3:\nthose galaxies are omitted from our main sample. We find that most cases this occurs when\nthe H\u03b1 line is too broad and/or emission of [NII] is much stronger than that of H\u03b1, and\n4\n\nAlthough new photometry is available in DR1, we use old photometry of EDR since the morphologically\nclassified catalogue is made using the sample based on old photometry and the completeness would be lost\nin faint magnitudes if new photometry is adopted.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nautomated deblending of the H\u03b1 lines is not properly executed. So, those that are missed\nby 2.5\u03c3 criterion for EW> 1\u00c5 are AGN like galaxies. Finally, we dropped one galaxy for\nwhich the fibre is centred on a HII region off the centre of galaxy. Thus, our emission line\ngalaxy sample contains 665 galaxies.\nWe show in Figure 1 the EW distribution of H\u03b1 for morphologically-classified sample,\nfrom the latest type (top panel) to earlier types. The bottom panel is the total sample.\nA negative EW signifies absorption. The solid lines correspond to our main sample with\nEW> 1\u00c5 and the detection at > 2.5\u03c3, and dotted are galaxies that do not satisfy these\ncriteria. Note that the ordinate is a logarithmic. The mean of emission line strengths for\neach morphological class is indicated by the diamonds. In this average (indicated by dotted\nhistogram), we include galaxies with EW< 1\u00c5 and with lower confidence detection, as well\nas those that do not show emission at all. AGN-like galaxies, as discussed in Sect. 2.4, are\ndenoted with shading. The numbers are presented in Table 1, where emission line galaxies\nare listed separately for non-AGN and AGN galaxies. The bottom panel shows that for\nEW> 5\u00c5 the galaxies that are excluded from the sample by 2.5\u03c3 detection are only a few,\nand the sample is virtually complete. The sample incompleteness for EW= 1 \u2212 5\u00c5 is about\n14%. We also try to include those galaxies which do not satisfy the > 1\u00c5 or the 2.5\u03c3\ncriterion in our analysis and examine how the results change.\n\n2.2.\n\nStellar Absorption Corrections\n\nThe measured Balmer emission line equivalent widths must be corrected for stellar\nabsorption. The absorption not only decreases H\u03b1 emission flux, but also significantly affects\nestimates of reddening corrections inferred from Balmer line ratios. Figure 2 shows the\nrelation between EW(H\u03b1) and EW(H\u03b2)\u00d7Fc (H\u03b2)/Fc (H\u03b1), where Fc is the continuum flux\ndensities at the two lines [Fc (H\u03b2)/Fc (H\u03b1) \u2243 1.0 for galaxies with EW(H\u03b1)\u2264 25\u00c5 in our\nsample]. The relation plotted in this figure is equivalent to that between the line fluxes,\nF (H\u03b1) and F (H\u03b2). Considering galaxies with EW(H\u03b1)>10.0\u00c5, for which corresponding\nEW(H\u03b2) is mostly larger than 1.0\u00c5 and hence the H\u03b2 measurement is reliable, we obtain\nwith a \u03c72 fit,\nFc (H\u03b2)\nEW(H\u03b2) \u00d7\n= \u22121.58 + 0.246 \u00d7 EW(H\u03b1),\n(1)\nFc (H\u03b1)\nwhere 3\u03c3 rejection is applied. The existence of a non-zero constant term indicates the\npresence of stellar absorption. If we take the H\u03b1 absorption to have an equivalent width\nof \u22121.8\u00c5, as indicated from the conspicuous clustering of non-emission line galaxies seen in\nthe figure, we obtain from eq. (1) EW(H\u03b2)abs = \u22122.0\u00c5, which is also consistent with the\nposition of EW(H\u03b2) for non-emission line galaxies.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nAn independent check of the effect of stellar absorption is carried out assuming EW(H\u03b3)abs\n=EW(H\u03b2)abs (e.g., McCall, Rybski & Shields 1985) for 168 galaxies with EW(H\u03b3) detection at > 2.5\u03c3 out of 665 emission line galaxies. After extinction corrections and assuming the standard Balmer line ratios, as we describe in the next subsection, we obtain\nEW(H\u03b3)abs \u2248 \u22121.5\u00c5. (see Figure 3) independent of EW(H\u03b1).\nIn our following analysis we take EWabs (H\u03b1)=\u22121.8\u00c5 and EWabs (H\u03b2)=\u22122.0\u00c5 for all\ngalaxies. We note that the estimate of extinction corrections depends little on the absolute\nvalue of the stellar absorption in so far as we use the H\u03b2/H\u03b1 line ratio from (1).\n\n2.3.\n\nExtinction Corrections\n\nThe extinction correction for the line flux is estimated from the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 Balmer line\nratio, which is written\nF (H\u03b1)\n= D 10\u2212c[f (H\u03b1)\u2212f (H\u03b2)] ,\nF (H\u03b2)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere D is the ratio of the intrinsic fluxes emitted in the nebula, f (\u03bb) = k(\u03bb)/k(H\u03b2), and c =\n0.4k(H\u03b2)E(B \u2212 V ) with k(\u03bb) the Whitford extinction curve that satisfies k(\u03bb) = A\u03bb /E(B \u2212\nV ). We take Seaton's (1979) law for k(\u03bb), which gives k(H\u03b2) = 3.68 and k(H\u03b2)/k(H\u03b1) =\n1.48. We also evaluate the extinction using O'Donnell (1994) extinction law with R =\n3.1 \u00b1 0.2 to investigate the systematic error. We set D = 2.86 assuming Baker-Menzel case\nB recombination for the electron temperature Te = 104 K and the density ne = 100 cm\u22123\n(Brocklehurst 1971). The change of the temperature by a factor of two modifies D only by\n5%; the change of ne affects D very little.\nFor galaxies with > 2.5\u03c3 detection of H\u03b2 [EW(H\u03b1)&10.0\u00c5], eq. (2) is applied to each\ngalaxy to derive AH\u03b1 . The distribution of extinction is shown in Figure 4 after converting\nit into V band extinction AV using AV /AH\u03b1 = 1.28. The mean value of extinction is\nhAV i = 1.10. This distribution is consistent with that obtained by Sullivan et al. (2000)\nfor hzi = 0.2 galaxies (hAV i = 0.97). The mean extinction also agrees with the value\nderived by Kennicutt (1983). If stellar absorption is not taken into account, the extinction\ncorrection would become erroneously large by 70%, as noted by Sullivan et al. (2000), and\nthe resulting extinction correction would also show an anticorrelation with the H\u03b1 equivalent\nwidth. For rather weak emitters, i.e., EW(H\u03b1)<10.0\u00c5 or the H\u03b2 detection below 2.5\u03c3, we\nadopt AH\u03b1 =0.81 (hAV i = 1.03) which is determined by the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 line ratio calculated from\neq. (1).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n2.4.\n\nAGNs\n\nSince we are primarily interested in the star formation activity, we must remove H\u03b1 contributions from AGN. We use the line diagnostic diagram employing [NII]\u03bb6583/H\u03b1 versus\n[OIII]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 to identify AGN (Baldwin, Phillips, & Terlevich 1981; Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987; see also Kewley et al. 2001). We require that four relevant lines be detected\nat more than 2.5\u03c3. Then, 363 galaxies out of 665 galaxies pass this criterion. The line\ndiagnostic we use is immune to dust extinction, since the lines of each pair are close enough\nin wavelength.\nWe use the criterion set by Kauffmann et al. (2003), which was applied to the SDSS\ngalaxy sample to select AGN:\nlog(\n\n[OIII]\u03bb5007\n0.61\n)\u2265\n+ 1.3,\n[NII]\u03bb6583\nH\u03b2\nlog( H\u03b1 ) \u2212 0.05\n\n(3)\n\nwhere H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 should be corrected for stellar absorption. 89 galaxies satisfy this criterion\nand are identified as Seyfert II or LINER. The frequency of AGN thus identified is 6%,\ncompared to 18% in the Kauffmann et al. sample. The difference arises from weak H\u03b2\nline emitters, for which special effort is made by Kauffmann et al. to measure weak lines\nwith higher signal-to-noise ratio. In our sample about 3% of galaxies with H\u03b2 emission of\nEW>1\u00c5 are missed by our 2.5\u03c3 criterion, but this fraction increases to 26% for EW=0.51\u00c5 and rapidly increases for EW< 0.5\u00c5 . Most of the difference in numbers of AGN between\nKauffmann et al. and this study arises from galaxies with EW(H\u03b2) < 0.5\u00c5, which are not\nimportant to us. If we use two-line diagnostic with only H\u03b1 and [NII] [log([NII]\u03bb6583/H\u03b1) >\n\u22120.3], the number of AGN increases to 235 galaxies which is 16% of the total number of\ngalaxies. In the next section we derive the H\u03b1 luminosity functions, the result of which only\nweakly depends on whether we reject 89 AGN or 235 'AGN'.\n\n2.5.\n\nAperture corrections\n\nSince the line flux is measured with fibres of a 3\u2032\u2032 aperture, aperture corrections are\nessential to estimate total H\u03b1 luminosity of galaxies. There is also a problem with spectrophotometric calibration, the error of which is about \u2248 20% (Stoughton et al. 2002),\nwhich we confirmed for our sample.\nThe aperture correction is made by using empirical radial profiles of H\u03b1 and broad band\nfluxes obtained by RD94. These authors studied H\u03b1 and I band surface brightnesses for 34\nnearby S0 and spiral galaxies. We show in Figure 5 the H\u03b1 flux versus i\u2032 band flux (I mag\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof RD94 is translated to i\u2032 system using Fukugita et al. 1995). The dashed (dotted) lines\nshow the trace of H\u03b1 and i\u2032 band fluxes of RD94 photometry: it moves left/upwards as the\naperture increases and the circle denoting their 'total' flux. Superimposed in the bundle of\ntraces are SDSS spectrophotometric data of H\u03b1 and i\u2217 -synthetic flux in the 3\u2032\u2032 aperture. We\nsee that the SDSS data overlap very well with the RD94 traces, except for several galaxies\n(denoted by dots) which deviates from the SDSS data points.\nWe construct a composite growth curve of the ratio of H\u03b1 to I band flux from 28\ngalaxies, rejecting 6 galaxies that are outliers of the SDSS data. We integrate the H\u03b1 and I\nband fluxes from the centre of galaxies outwards, and the integrated H\u03b1 fluxes are evaluated\nagainst the integrated I band fluxes, with both total fluxes normalised to unity. We do not\nobserve systematic trends in growth curves that depend on morphologies of galaxies5 . To\nobtain the broad band Petrosian flux defined by the SDSS, we extrapolate the measured\nflux assuming an exponential profile with the scale length determined by RD94 (this gives\n\u2248 8 \u2212 20% correction). For the H\u03b1 flux, there is a natural cutoff at \u03bcH\u03b1 \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 1038 erg\ns\u22121 kpc\u22122 , as shown by Kennicutt (1998), and the limit of RD94 measurement agrees with\nthis cutoff; the integration of the flux measured by RD94 gives the total H\u03b1 flux. The growth\ncurve thus constructed is shown in Figure 6, together with those of individual galaxies (the\nerror bars show one sigma at representative points). The composite growth curve shows that\nH\u03b1 emission activity is somewhat more active in the outer region of galaxies than in the\ncentral part, although for individual galaxies the growth curves show a variety. Note that\nour 3\u2032\u2032 aperture corresponds to (2.1 \u2212 3.9)h\u22121 kpc at z = 0.05 \u2212 0.10.\nWe first renormalise the spectrophotometric flux by adjusting i\u2032 band synthetic magnitude obtained from spectrophotometry to the corresponding 3\u2032\u2032 aperture photometric magnitude to remove the calibration error of spectrophotometry, and then apply the growth curve\nto find the total H\u03b1 flux from its spectrophotometric flux and i\u2032 band photometric fluxes at\nthe 3\u2032\u2032 and the Petrosian apertures. Our calculation takes into account the aspect ratio of\nthe galaxy images, which gives only a small correction.\nThe aperture correction amounts to 2.40\u00b10.83 mag for z \u2243 0.015, 2.14\u00b10.59 mag at z \u2243\n0.05 and 1.56\u00b10.44 mag at z \u2243 0.1 (the error stands for rms). The total H\u03b1 flux we estimate\nis shown in Figure 7. We do not see any systematic variations of the high luminosity edge\nas a function of redshift, suggesting that aperture corrections are properly done. Systematic\nerrors from this aperture correction are estimated by changing the composite growth curve\n5\n\nThis does not mean that the ratio of the total H\u03b1 to the total I band fluxes does not depend on\nmorphology. RD94 showed that such a ratio actually depends on morphology, whereas the growth curve is\nnearly universal.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nby \u00b11\u03c3. If we would apply aperture correction simply by scaling the synthetic H\u03b1 flux with\nthe broad band fluxes measured at two apertures, we underestimate the total H\u03b1 flux by\n20\u221225%.\n\n3.\n\nThe H\u03b1 luminosity function\n3.1.\n\nCalculation\n\nWe calculate the H\u03b1 luminosity function (LF) for five morphological classes and for the\ntotal sample. We treat E and E/S0-S0 separately, but when we compute LF we add the\ntwo together since the number of H\u03b1 emission E galaxies (Fukugita et al. 2003) is too small\nto derive a reliable LF for this type. The number of galaxies in each morphological type\nis given in Table 1 above. We reject 89 AGN from the sample. We employ the step-wise\nmaximum likelihood estimator of Mobasher, Sharples, and Ellis (1993), using the rP\u2217 band\nLF calculated by the maximum likelihood estimator in N03. The step-wise H\u03b1 LF is given\nby\nN (LH\u03b1 )\nX \u03c6(Mri\u2217 )\nP\n,\n(4)\n\u03c6(LH\u03b1 )\u2206LH\u03b1 =\ni\nn(M\n\u2217 )\nr\ni=1\nP\n\n\u03c6(MriP\u2217 )\n\nrP\u2217\n\nn(MriP\u2217 )\n\nis the number of objects that emit H\u03b1 luminosity\nis the\nband LF,\nwhere\nbetween (LH\u03b1 \u2212 \u2206L/2) and (LH\u03b1 + \u2206L/2) and whose r \u2032 band luminosity is in the MriP\u2217\nmagnitude bin. The function in the sum corresponds to the inverse of a survey volume\nin a given magnitude bin given by the maximum likelihood estimator. This estimate is\nnot affected by inhomogeneity of the sample, unlike the 1/V (max) estimator for which the\nfunction in the sum is simply the inverse volume of visibility. The results are given in Figure\n8.\nThe H\u03b1 LF we obtained shows that the Schechter (1976) function\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nLH\u03b1\nLH\u03b1 dLH\u03b1\n\u2217\n\u03c6(LH\u03b1 )dLH\u03b1 = \u03c6\nexp \u2212 \u2217\nL\u2217\nL\nL\u2217\n\n(5)\n\ngives a reasonable fit. We carried out a \u03c72 fit, rejecting data in the bins where the number\nof galaxies is one (we include such data, however for the LF of Im type, as this entire sample\nis very small). The Schechter function fit suffers a binning artefact. We, therefore, carry out\n10 fits shifting the binning by 1/10 the interval of bins, and smear the resulting parameters.\nWe also removed the data in the faintest bin, which may be affected by the binning. The\nresults are presented in Figure 8 and the parameters obtained are shown in Figure 9, where\nthe error contours are one and two standard deviations of the \u03c72 fit. The parameters and\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\none standard deviation errors are also given in Table 2. We attempt to estimate errors by\nthe jackknife method dividing the sky region into 20 segments. We find that those errors are\ncomparable to one standard deviation errors we quoted.\nWe calculate H\u03b1 luminosity density for each morphological class by integrating the\nSchechter function to zero luminosity. This is compared to the luminosity density directly\nP\ncalculated as log L(H\u03b1) = i Li /Vimax (eff) where Vimax (eff) = n(MriP\u2217 )/\u03c6(MriP\u2217 ) that appears\nin eq. (4). The two estimates show good agreement for late types, but the two differ by\n0.1 dex for E-S0 and Im, for which statistics are very small and the Schechter function fits\nare rather poor: for these cases the direct sum is probably more reliable, and the luminosity\ndensities from the direct sum are adopted for our discussion. The total luminosity density\nfrom the Schechter function is log L(H\u03b1)(erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 ) = (39.31 \u00b1 0.04) + log h, which\nagrees with 39.33+log h from the direct sum. The sum of the component luminosity densities\namounts to 98% of the total (when we discuss the composition of the luminosity densities\nwe renormalise the component sum to 100%). Note that the r \u2032 band luminosity density of\nN03 is 2.00 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 h(Mpc)\u22123 .\nWe note that the incompleteness of spectroscopic and/or photometric samples is already\ncorrected by the use of r \u2032 band LF. The final correction should account for the under or\noverdensity of the bright galaxies in the northern equatorial stripes. The r \u2032 band luminosity\ndensity of N03 has virtually no offset against the global value of Blanton et al. (2003a)6.\nBefore discussing the results we address the problem of systematic uncertainties. The\nfirst issue is the effect of the threshold set for H\u03b1 detection (EW(H\u03b1) >1\u00c5). In order to\ntest the effect we decrease the detection threshold to EW(H\u03b1)\u2265 \u22120.8(\u00c5) removing the 2.5\u03c3\ndetection criterion. The new threshold corresponds to selecting galaxies with EW(H\u03b1)em \u2265\n1.0(\u00c5) after absorption correction. With this change the numbers of galaxies increase to 51,\n158, 394, 337, and 10 for E, S0, early spiral, late spiral, and Im galaxies, respectively (for\nweak line emitters, we do not reject galaxies that possibly satisfy the AGN criterion). While\nthis change increases the number of emission line galaxies by 50%, it does not appreciably\naffect the H\u03b1 LF for the late-type and the total samples. The change is observed in the\nfainter bins for E and S0 galaxies, which are dominated by non or weak H\u03b1 emitters around\nthe threshold. The brighter part of the E plus S0 luminosity function is unchanged. The\neffect on the H\u03b1 luminosity density is only +4%.\n6\n\nIn N03 we noted that the luminosity density of bright (r\u2217 < 15.9) galaxy sample is lower than the\ntotal spectroscopic sample with r\u2217 < 17.88 (Blanton et al. 2001) by 29%. A further study (Blanton et\nal. 2003a), however, showed that what is overdense is the spectroscopic sample of the northern equatorial\nstrip compared to the global value. In the r\u2032 pass band, the global luminosity density is approximately\n2.0 \u00d7 108 L\u2299 h(Mpc)\u22123 .\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThere is some uncertainty in the estimate of the stellar absorption correction. A\n\u00b10.5\u00c5 uncertainty in the stellar absorption strength yields a \u22123 to +7% change in the\nluminosity density. A complete neglect of stellar absorption would affect the H\u03b2/H\u03b1 flux\nratio for weak emitters, and leads to a significant overestimate of extinction corrections: this\nresults in the H\u03b1 luminosity about 0.4 dex brighter, and the luminosity density 50% larger\nthan the true value (NB: \u03c6\u2217 decreases). The change of extinction law from the Seaton (1979)\nto the O'Donnell (1994) relations (with R = 3.1) does not significantly affect the results:\nthe luminosity density increases by only +2%. Allowing for R = 3.1 \u00b1 0.2, the uncertainty\nis \u22122% to +10%. We also allocate an uncertainty of \u00b110% from the error for the estimate\nof hAH\u03b1 i.\nIf we exclude additional 146 weak H\u03b2 'AGN' as discussed in sect. 2.4, the luminosity\ndensity decreases by 5%. The shape of the H\u03b1 LF changes very little. A complete inclusion\nof all AGN would increase the H\u03b1 luminosity density, but it is no more than by +18%.\nThe systematic uncertainties we considered are summarised in Table 3, expressed in the\nform of the change in the luminosity density. We also include the cases which, we believe,\nare unrealistic in order to show the effect if we ignore the relevant considerations, as are\noccasionally seen in some previous works. The systematic error is obtained by adding the\nentries with asterisk in quadrature: our estimate is +0.10 dex and \u22120.07 dex for L.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe results\n\nThe characteristics of our H\u03b1 LF are as follows.\n1. The H\u03b1 LF for the total sample is fitted well by a Schechter function with \u03b1 =\n\u22121.43 \u00b1 0.10 and log L\u2217 = 41.68 \u00b1 0.10. The H\u03b1 luminosity density derived from our LF,\nlog L(H\u03b1)(erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 ) = 39.31 \u00b1 0.04 + log h.\nWe estimate the systematic error to be\n\n(6)\n\n+0.10\n.\n\u22120.07\n\n2. Early- (1.5 \u2264 T \u2264 3) and late-type (3.5 \u2264 T \u2264 5) spirals are the dominant contributors to the total H\u03b1 LF. The H\u03b1 LFs for these two types of galaxies are similar, and they\ndetermine the shape of the total LF. The faint end slopes are somewhat steeper than those\nfor the r \u2032 band LF. Spiral galaxies (1.5 \u2264 T \u2264 5) produce 83% of the total H\u03b1 luminosity\ndensity.\n3. The contribution of early type galaxies (E and S0) is only 9% of the total luminosity\ndensity. In particular the luminosity density from E (8 galaxies) is only 6% that of all early\ntype (E to S0) galaxies. The characteristic luminosity of the H\u03b1 LF for the E-S0 types\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nis about 0.7 dex fainter than those for spiral galaxies. While our 'best fit' to the H\u03b1 LF\nindicates a decline towards the faint end, we are not able to conclude whether the H\u03b1 LF\nfor early type galaxies actually declines because of the small number of galaxies and the\nomission of very weak H\u03b1 emitters. The inclusion of weak emitters [EW(H\u03b1)\u2265 \u22120.8(\u00c5)]\nlifts the faint end slope, although \u03b1 is still larger than \u22121 (\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.5).\n4. The H\u03b1 LF for Im type galaxies shows a steep faint end slope. This result is similar\nto that found for the r \u2032 band LF. Im galaxies contribute 5% of the local H\u03b1 luminosity\ndensity. This is rather a significant fraction if we consider the fact that only 0.7% of galaxies\n(10 galaxies) in our sample are Im type and their broad band luminosity is fainter than that\nof normal galaxies. We also note in Figure 1 that all Im galaxies are strong H\u03b1 emitters.\n5. Most of the galaxies with unclassified morphology (6 out of 7 galaxies) are also strong\nH\u03b1 emitters [EW(H\u03b1) > 20\u00c5]. These unclassified galaxies contain mergers.\n\n3.3.\n\nComparison with Gallego et al.\n\nSince the work of Gallego et al. (1995) provides the current fiducial value for the star\nformation rate at zero redshift, we shall present a detailed comparison of their results and\nour H\u03b1 LF.\nThe luminosity function and luminosity density we derived are consistent with the findings of Gallego et al. who derived \u03b1 = \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.2, and log L\u2217 = 41.56 \u00b1 0.08 \u2212 2 log h.\nWhile this L\u2217 looks somewhat smaller than our value, L\u2217 and \u03b1 are correlated such that\n\u2206(log L) \u2248 \u22120.4\u2206\u03b1; so if we adjust \u03b1 = \u22121.43, then we have log L\u2217 = 41.61 \u00b1 0.08 \u2212 2 log h\nwhich is smaller than our log L\u2217 = 41.68 \u00b1 0.10 \u2212 2 log h only by 1 \u03c3. The luminosity density\nlog L(H\u03b1) = 39.38 \u00b1 0.04 + log h is larger than (6) by about 20% (0.07 dex). We consider,\nhowever, that these rather good agreements are fortuitous.\nGallego et al. did not take account of stellar absorption. The neglect of stellar absorptions leads to a substantial overestimate of extinction corrections (see section 2.3 above).\nWe find that their selective extinction E(B \u2212 V ) tabulated in the catalogue of Gallego et al.\n(1996) show a conspicuous decrease as the H\u03b1 equivalent width increases, which is the feature that occurs if stellar absorption is ignored. In fact their mean value of E(B \u2212 V ) \u2243 0.64\n(AV = 2.05) is 1.9 times as large as the extinction we obtained. This overestimate of the\nabsorption makes the luminosity density larger by 0.16 dex than the true value (see Table\n3). The inclusion of AGN also leads to an overestimate of the luminosity density by < 0.07\ndex.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nGallego et al. set the threshold EW(H\u03b1+[NII])>10\u00c5(effective H\u03b1 EW 7\u00c5); this selection would cause a 10% decrease in the H\u03b1 luminosity density. What gives a strong effect is\ntheir sample incompleteness, which compensates the significant overdensity seen above. The\nsurface density of H\u03b1 emitters with EW(H\u03b1+[NII])>10\u00c5 is 176/471=0.37 per sq. deg. This\nis compared with 306/230=1.33 per sq. deg. when we select emission line galaxies from the\nSDSS sample in a manner that satisfies the same EW threshold and z < 0.045 as in Gallego\net al. The EW distributions of the two samples are compared in Figure 10, which shows\nwhere Gallego et al.'s sample is incomplete. Note that we have applied aperture corrections\nfor the EW distribution of the SDSS sample so that the line flux represents that from the\nentire galaxy. It appears that the underestimate due to sample incompleteness cancels the\noverestimates from the neglects of stellar absorptions and contamination from AGN.\n\n4.\n\nCorrelation of H\u03b1 emissivity with galaxy properties\n4.1.\n\nH\u03b1 emissivity and galaxy morphology\n\nFigure 1 and Table 1 above show the clear trend that the fraction of H\u03b1 emission\ngalaxies increases as T moves from early to late types. If we set the threshold of EW> 1\u00c5,\nthe fraction of galaxies with H\u03b1 emission is 5% (4% if we remove galaxies with AGN activity)\nfor E galaxies, 15% (12%) for S0 galaxies, 54% (44%) for S0/a-Sb and 86% (80%) for Sbc-Sd\ngalaxies. We have seen that S0/a-Sb and Sbc-Sd contribute nearly the same amount to the\nluminosity density. This is due to a larger number of S0/a-Sb type galaxies than that of\nSbc-Sd (by a factor of 1.5), whereas the fraction of emitters in the former class is less by\n1.6 times than the latter; these changes in the two factors cancel and leave the luminosity\ndensity unchanged. In our sample, the fraction of H\u03b1 emitters is 100% for Im galaxies. A\nhigh fraction (\u2248 86%) is also recorded for galaxies of unclassified types. Conversely, 89% of\nemitters are spiral galaxies, and they contribute to 83% of the H\u03b1 luminosity density. Note\nthat elliptical galaxies are not necessarily inactive (Fukugita et al. 2003).\nGalaxies in each morphological class contain strong H\u03b1 emitters. If one makes a cut at\nhigh EW threshold, say at 10\u00c5, the average of EW for those emitters look nearly independent of morphology. The most important difference that varies with morphology is in the\nincreasing number of non-emission or weak emission galaxies towards early types. Therefore\nthe average EW decreases to early types when the average is taken over all galaxies including\nnon-emission galaxies. The 'average' emission equivalent width depends on how to set the\nthreshold for emission galaxies.\nKennicutt and Kent (1983) showed a clear correlation of EW(H\u03b1+[NII]) with morphol-\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nogy, notably the absence of strong emitters in earlier types (Sa or earlier). We consider this\nabsence of emitters being due to their small sample, and in particular to the fact that bona\nfide early-type galaxies are selected before the observation.\n\n4.2.\n\nH\u03b1 emissivity and galaxy colours\n\nThe natural assumption is that H\u03b1 emission galaxies, being hosts to vigorous star formation, should have bluer colours than galaxies that are bereft of H\u03b1 emission. Tresse &\nMaddox (1998) claimed, however, that there is no correlation between H\u03b1 luminosity L(H\u03b1)\nand (V \u2212 I) colour. We also find in our sample that the correlation between H\u03b1 luminosity\nand g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 colour is weak (Figure 11a). Also, we do not see correlations with other colour\nindices, e.g., u\u2217 \u2212 g \u2217. The correlation we should actually expect, however, is not between\ntotal H\u03b1 luminosity and colour, but between H\u03b1 emissivity per unit mass (or per broad band\nluminosity) and the colour. To see this point we plot in Figure 11b the correlation of the H\u03b1\nluminosity divided by i\u2032 band luminosity with gP\u2217 \u2212 rP\u2217 colour. The expected correlation is\nobserved: there is a 2 mag change in H\u03b1 luminosity normalised by i\u2032 band luminosity across\n0.5 mag change in g \u2217 \u2212 r \u2217 colour, though the scatter is significant, especially for strong H\u03b1\nemitters.\n\n5.\n\nImplications of our results\n\nWe have derived the H\u03b1 luminosity function for the nearby universe and have made\na break down into morphological types of galaxies. Our sample contain 665 emission line\ngalaxies, which are compared, for example, to 176 galaxies in Gallego et al. (1995), 159\ngalaxies in Sullivan et al. (2000), and 110 galaxies in Tresse & Maddox (1998); see Table 4,\nwhich gives a comparison of the present result with those of the earlier work made for low\nredshifts. Our observed range of L(H\u03b1) is 0.4 dex deeper than Gallego et al., although it is\nshallower by 0.4-0.8 dex than surveys of distant galaxies by Sullivan et al. (2000) and Tresse\n& Maddox (1998).\n+0.10\n\nThe local H\u03b1 luminosity density we have obtained is 1039.31\u00b10.04 \u22120.07 h erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 .\nThe central value is lower than that of Gallego et al. (1995) but only by 0.08 dex, although\nthis agreement is fortuitous.\nThe significant discrepancy between Tresse & Maddox (1998) and Sullivan et al. (2000)\nfor analyses at non-zero redshift hinders us from drawing a definitive conclusions as to the\nevolution of H\u03b1 emissivity. In comparing the characteristic luminosities we note that L\u2217\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nand \u03b1 are strongly correlated. Assuming an empirical law, d log L\u2217 /d\u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.4, Tresse &\nMaddox's value is (41.64 \u00b1 0.13 \u2212 2 log h) dex and Sullivan et al.'s is (42.03 \u00b1 0.14 \u2212 2 log h)\ndex if we adjust \u03b1 to our \u22121.43. Our value is in between the two. Our faint end slope is\nalso between the two groups of authors. On the other hand, the H\u03b1 luminosity density of\nthe two groups (1039.66\u00b10.04 , 1039.43\u00b10.06 )h erg s\u22121 Mpc\u22123 are larger than our value by 2.2\u22121.3\ntimes. We emphasize, however, that the samples at non-zero redshifts are too small, and\nthe uncertainty in the correction of the spectroscopically obtained flux to total flux might\nalso be significant; the definitive conclusion may not be drawn as to the evolution at low\nredshift. The evolution can be concluded, however, if we compare our results with those at\nhigh redshifts (e.g., Glazebrook et al. 1999; Tresse et al. 2002).\nThe conversion of H\u03b1 luminosity density to the global star formation rate per unit\nvolume depends further on models of star formation and absorption of the ionising flux in\nthe star-forming regions (Charlot & Longhetti 2001). If we adopt the conversion factor of\nGlazebrook et al. (1999) for the case BC96(kl96) Z/Z\u2299 = 1.0, and Salpeter IMF (with the\nlower mass cutoff at 0.1M\u2299 ): L(H\u03b1) = 1.35 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 for star formation rate of 1 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 , we obtain the global star formation rate \u03c8:\n\u03c8 \u2243 0.015hM\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 ,\n\n(7)\n\nignoring internal absorption of the ionising flux.\nSome early type galaxies, even elliptical galaxies, emit strong H\u03b1 by star formation\nactivity, almost as strong as that of late spiral galaxies. This contradicts the conventional\nwisdom that all ellipticals formed in the early universe. The fraction of H\u03b1 emitters, however,\nis quite small: it is only 1% if we take a threshold of EW(H\u03b1) >10\u00c5 (and 5% with EW(H\u03b1) >\n1\u00c5): the majority of elliptical galaxies no longer have significant star formation. On the other\nhand, there are many late spiral galaxies that do not show H\u03b1 emission (in our sample all Im\ngalaxies are H\u03b1 emitters). The presence of non star-forming spiral galaxies is consistent with\nthe view that star formation in disc galaxies is intermittent, but the fraction of star forming\ngalaxies with > 1M\u2299 yr\u22121 (\u2248 50%) indicates that in spiral galaxies such star formation\nactivity takes place about half the time. The quantity that shows a strong correlation with\nmorphology of galaxies is the fraction of H\u03b1 emitters, or the mean H\u03b1 luminosities, not the\nH\u03b1 luminosities of individual galaxies.\nAcknowledgements\nWe should like to thank Stuart Ryder for his useful communications and Christy Tremonti\nfor useful discussions and comments to the preliminary manuscript.
