The paradigm\nof a qubit coupled to a harmonic oscillator has also\nbeen analyzed by numerous authors over the past few\ndecades [1, 2]. Physical systems that can be described\nby this model include natural atoms coupled to optical\nor microwave cavities [2], superconducting qubits coupled\nto superconducting resonators [3\u20135], quantum dots or\nCooper-pair boxes coupled to nanomechanical resonators\n[6\u20138], electrons interacting with phonons in a solid [9] and\nsome models of chaotic systems [10].\nIn the early work on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in atomic systems, the achievable atom-cavity\ncoupling strengths were smaller than the atomic and cavity decay rates, usually limiting observations to only indirect signatures of the theoretically predicted phenomena.\nRecently, the strong-coupling regime, where the coupling\nstrength is larger than the decay rates in the system, has\nbeen achieved [11]. In addition to atomic systems, the\nstrong-coupling regime has been achieved in superconducting circuit-QED systems [3, 4], and superconductingqubit-nanomechanical-resonator systems are approaching this regime [7]. In fact, superconducting systems\nare suited for achieving the so-called ultrastrong-coupling\nregime, where the qubit-oscillator coupling strength is\ncomparable to the qubit and oscillator energy scales [12].\nOne can expect to find new phenomena in this regime\nthat are not present in the weak or moderately strong\ncoupling regimes. Indeed there have been a number of\ntheoretical studies on this system analyzing some of its\nrich static and dynamical properties [13\u201318].\nOne reason why superconducting systems are well\nsuited for the implementation of qubit-oscillator experiments is the flexibility they allow in terms of designing\nthe different system parameters. For example, in the\ntwo earliest experiments on circuit QED, Chiorescu et\n\nal. [3] used a low-frequency oscillator, while Wallraff et\nal. [4] realized a resonant qubit-oscillator system. Subgigahertz qubits have also been realized in recent experiments [19], and there should be no difficulty in fabricating high-frequency oscillators. Therefore, all possible\ncombinations of qubit and oscillator frequencies are accessible, in principle. One advantage of superconducting\nqubits over natural atoms is the additional control associated with the tunability of essentially all the qubit\nparameters [20], as will be discussed in more detail below. This tunability contrasts with the situation encountered with natural atoms, where the atomic parameters\nare essentially fixed by nature. This advantage can be\nseen clearly in the recent experiments where Fock states\nand arbitrary oscillator states were prepared in a superconducting qubit-oscillator system [21, 22]. We shall see,\nhowever, that the additional controllability comes at the\nprice of having to deal with additional coupling channels to the environment, and this unwanted coupling can\nincrease the fragility of nonclassical states.\nIn this paper we present analytical arguments and numerical calculations pertaining to the strongly coupled\nqubit-oscillator system from the point of view of the potential for preparing nonclassical states in this setup.\nThese states include squeezed states or superpositions\nof macroscopically distinct states (i.e. Schr\u00f6dinger-cat\nstate) in the oscillator, as well as qubit-oscillator entangled states [23]. In this study, we shall consider all the\ndifferent combinations of qubit and oscillator frequencies.\nWe shall also analyze in some detail the effect of the tunability in the qubit parameters on the behaviour of the\nsystem.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the Hamiltonian that we shall use throughout the\npaper. In Sec. III we discuss various analytical methods that can be used to study the system under different\nassumptions, and we compare the predictions of these\nmethods. In Sec. IV we present results of numerical\ncalculations that demonstrate the properties of the energy eigenstates of the system, including the nonclassical\n\n\f2\nproperties of the ground state. In Sec. V we discuss the\npossibility of preparing and detecting the three types of\nnonclassical states of interest. In Sec. VI we discuss the\neffect of decoherence on the robustness of nonclassical\nstates. Section VII contains some concluding remarks.\nII.\n\nIt is convenient for some calculations to express the\noscillator Hamiltonian using the creation (\u00e2\u2020 ) and annihilation (\u00e2) operators:\n\u00e2 = X\u0302 + iP\u0302\n\u00e2\u2020 = X\u0302 \u2212 iP\u0302\nr\nm\u03c90\nX\u0302 =\nx\u0302\n2h\u0304\n1\np\u0302,\nP\u0302 = \u221a\n2h\u0304m\u03c90\n\nHAMILTONIAN\n\n...\n\n(3)\n\nwhich give\n\nqubit\n\ncoupling\n\n1\n\u0124ho = h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + h\u0304\u03c90\n2\n\u0001\n\u0124int = \u03bb \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302z\nr\nh\u0304\n.\n\u03bb = g\n2m\u03c90\n\noscillator\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the system under consideration.\nA qubit with energy separation Eq between its ground and\nexcited states (|gi and |ei) is coupled to a harmonic oscillator\nwith characteristic frequency \u03c90 . The coupling strength is\ngiven by g or \u03bb, depending on the language used to describe\nthe oscillator.\n\nThe system that we consider here is a qubit coupled\nto a harmonic oscillator, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Rather\nthan worry about deriving the model from a microscopic\ndescription of an electric circuit (see e.g. Refs. [12, 24,\n25]), we shall assume that the description of the system\nas being composed of these two physical components with\na coupling term of the standard form is an accurate description of the system.\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is given by:\n\u0124 = \u0124q + \u0124ho + \u0124int ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\nThe coupling strength can therefore be quantified either\nthrough g or \u03bb.\nWe shall refer to the eigenstates of \u0124q as the qubit's\nground and excited states, denoted by |gi and |ei, keeping in mind the caveat that this identification becomes\nless meaningful for strong qubit-oscillator coupling. The\nenergies\nof these two states are \u00b1Eq /2, where Eq =\n\u221a\n\u22062 + \u01eb2 . It is also useful to define an angle \u03b8 that characterizes the relative size of the \u03c3\u0302x and \u03c3\u0302z terms in the\nqubit Hamiltonian: tan \u03b8 = \u01eb/\u2206. The eigenstates of \u0124ho\nare given by |ni, where n = 0, 1, 2, ..., with energies given\nby nh\u0304\u03c90 (up to the ground state energy h\u0304\u03c90 /2, which we\nignore from now on). The integer n represents the number of excitations, to which we shall refer as photons, in\nthe oscillator.\n\nIII.\n\n\u0124q\n\u0124ho\n\u0124int\n\n\u2206\n\u01eb\n= \u2212 \u03c3\u0302x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302z\n2\n2\n1\np\u03022\n+ m\u03c902 x\u03022\n=\n2m 2\n= g x\u0302\u03c3\u0302z ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c3\u0302x and \u03c3\u0302z are the usual Pauli matrices (with \u03c3\u0302z |\u2191i =\n|\u2191i , \u03c3\u0302z |\u2193i = \u2212 |\u2193i), and x\u0302 and p\u0302 are the position and\nmomentum operators of the harmonic oscillator. The\nparameters \u2206 and \u01eb are the gap and bias which characterize the qubit, m is the oscillator's effective mass, \u03c90\nis the oscillator's characteristic frequency, and g is the\nqubit-oscillator coupling strength. Note that in contrast\nto atomic cavity QED systems, where \u01eb = 0, this parameter is easily tunable in present-day experiments using\nsuperconducting qubits. We shall therefore treat \u01eb as\na tunable parameter (It is worth noting here that most\npast studies on the ultrastrong-coupling regime have focused on the case \u01eb = 0; however, see Ref. [17]). For\ndefiniteness, we shall take \u2206 and g to be positive.\n\n(4)\n\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT\nANALYTICAL METHODS\n\nIn this section we describe some analytical methods\nthat can be used to determine the properties and behaviour of the system based on different assumptions\n(which are valid in different parameter regimes), and we\ncompare the predictions of the different methods.\n\nA.\n\nWeak coupling\n\nThe simplest limit is probably the weak-coupling limit\n[2], where \u03bb \u226a Eq , h\u0304\u03c90 . Strictly speaking, one also\nneeds to consider the number of photons in the oscillator\nwhen determining whether the weak-coupling condition\nis satisfied. However, since in this paper we focus on\na system that remains close to its ground state, we assume a small number of photons in the oscillator. In the\nweak-coupling limit, one can think of the qubit and oscillator as being well-defined, separate physical systems\n\n\f3\nthat interact weakly and can exchange excitations with\none another [1].\nIn the limit of small \u03bb, one can treat \u0124int as a small\nperturbation in the total Hamiltonian. The energy eigenstates in the absence of this perturbation are given by\n|n, gi = |ni \u2297 |gi and |n, ei = |ni \u2297 |ei, with energies\nnh\u0304\u03c90 \u00b1 Eq /2 (recall that we ignore the h\u0304\u03c90 /2 term in\nthe oscillator's energy).\nWhen there are no degeneracies in the non-interacting\nsystem (i.e. in the Hamiltonian given by \u0124q + \u0124ho ), the\naddition of the perturbation \u0124int has only a small effect\non the behaviour of the system. This perturbation only\nslightly modifies the energy levels and eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian.\nWhen Eq \u2248 h\u0304\u03c90 , the states |n, gi and |n \u2212 1, ei are\nnearly degenerate (note that there is one such pair of\nnearly degenerate states for each value of n), and the\nperturbation term couples them. In particular, the relevant matrix elements are given by hn, g| \u0124int |n \u2212 1, ei =\n\u221a\n\u03bb n cos \u03b8, hn, g| \u0124int |n, gi = hn \u2212 1, e| \u0124int |n \u2212 1, ei =\n0 and hn \u2212 1, e| (\u0124q + \u0124ho ) |n \u2212 1, ei \u2212 hn, g| (\u0124q +\n\u0124ho ) |n, gi = Eq \u2212 h\u0304\u03c90 . In other words the effective\nHamiltonian that one needs to consider is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u03b4/2\n\u03bb n cos \u03b8\n\u221a\n\u0124eff =\n,\n(5)\n\u03bb n cos \u03b8\n\u2212\u03b4/2\nwhere \u03b4 = Eq \u2212 h\u0304\u03c90 . Using this Hamiltonian, one can\nanalyze the behaviour of the system. In particular, when\nEq = h\u0304\u03c90 , an excitation oscillates back and\n\u221aforth between\nthe qubit and oscillator with frequency 2\u03bb n cos \u03b8, which\nis commonly referred to as the Rabi frequency.\nDegeneracies also occur when Eq = kh\u0304\u03c90 , with k being\nany integer. In this case, one can go to higher orders in\nperturbation theory and obtain analytic, though sometimes cumbersome, expressions describing the properties\nand dynamics of the system. We shall not go any further\nin analyzing this situation here[26].\nNote that the same results as those explained above\n(for the case Eq \u2248 h\u0304\u03c90 ) can be obtained by taking the\nterm \u0124int in the Hamiltonian and replacing it by its\nrotating-wave-approximation (RWA) form:\n\u0001\n(6)\n\u0124int,RWA = \u03bb cos \u03b8 \u00e2\u03c3\u0302+ + \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 ,\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302\u00b1 are the qubit raising and lowering operators\n(\u03c3\u0302+ |gi = |ei etc.). This approximation therefore ignores\nthe so-called counter-rotating terms in \u0124int , which are\nproportional to \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302+ and \u00e2\u03c3\u0302\u2212 , as well as a term proportional to (\u00e2+\u00e2\u2020 )(|ei he|\u2212|gi hg|) that appears when \u01eb 6= 0.\nThese terms would change the number of excitations in\nthe system, thus mixing states that have a large energy\nseparation (assuming \u03bb \u226a Eq , h\u0304\u03c90 ), and energy conservation suppresses such processes. The RWA therefore\napproximates the original Hamiltonian by one where the\nstate |n, gi is coupled only to the state |n \u2212 1, ei, which\nwould lead to exactly the same algebra and results mentioned above. Some of the recent studies on ultrastrong\n\ncoupling have analyzed the effects of the counter-rotating\nterms on the system dynamics [16, 18].\n\nB.\n\nHigh-frequency, adiabatically adjusting\noscillator\n\nThe next limit that we consider is that where the oscillator's characteristic frequency \u03c90 is large compared\nto the qubit's energy splitting (i.e. h\u0304\u03c90 \u226b Eq ) and also\ncompared to the coupling strength (h\u0304\u03c90 \u226b \u03bb). In this\ncase one can say that the oscillator remains in its initial\nenergy eigenstate (i.e. ground state, first excited state,\netc.), and this state follows adiabatically any changes in\nthe qubit's state. This case was analyzed theoretically in\nRefs. [14, 15].\nThe procedure for adiabatically eliminating the highfrequency oscillator from the problem is straightforward.\nOne starts by noting that the qubit is coupled to the\noscillator through the operator \u03c3\u0302z . As a result, one can\nthink of the oscillator as always monitoring the qubit\nobservable \u03c3z and adjusting to be in the instantaneous\nenergy eigenstate that corresponds to that value of \u03c3z\n(Note here that if the qubit is in a superposition of two\ndifferent \u03c3z states, each part of the superposition \u2013 with\na well-defined value of \u03c3z \u2013 will have the oscillator in the\ncorresponding energy eigenstate).\nWe therefore start by assuming that the qubit has a\nwell-defined value of \u03c3z , equal to \u00b11. The oscillator now\nfeels the effective Hamiltonian (calculated from \u0124ho and\n\u0124int ):\n\u0124ho,eff\n\n\u03c3z =\u00b11\n\n\u0001\n= h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u00b1 \u03bb \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 .\n\n(7)\n\nThis Hamiltonian corresponds simply to the original oscillator Hamiltonian with a constant force term applied\nto it.

There will\ntherefore not be a qubit-state-dependent energy that we\nneed to take into account when we turn to analyzing the\nbehaviour of the (slow) qubit.

We\ntake any given value for the index n, which specifies the\noscillator's state, and we use it to construct an effective\nqubit Hamiltonian for that value of n. Since there are two\nqubit states for each value of n, the effective Hamiltonian\nwill be a 2n\u00d7 2 matrix\noperating\nin the space defined by\nE\nEo\ng\ng\nthe states n, \u2191 , n, \u2193\n(We use the tildes in order to\nemphasize that the oscillator's state is different from the\nstate |ni of the free oscillator). The four relevant matrix\nelements can be calculated straightforwardly as\nD\nE\nD\nE\ng\u2191 \u0124q n,\ng\u2191 = \u2212 n,\ng\u2193 \u0124q n,\ng\u2193 = \u2212 \u01eb\nn,\n2\nE\nE\nD\nD\ng\ng\ng\ng\nn, \u2191 \u0124q n, \u2193 = n, \u2193 \u0124q n, \u2191\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 #\n\u2206 \u22122\u03bb2 /(h\u0304\u03c90 )2 0\n2\u03bb\n= \u2212 e\n(13)\n.\nLn\n2\nh\u0304\u03c90\nThe qubit is therefore described by the effective Hamiltonian\n\u0013\n\u0012\n \u0303\n1\n\u01eb \u2206\n(14)\n\u0124eff = \u2212\n \u0303 \u2212\u01eb ,\n2 \u2206\n \u0303 is given by Eq. (13) and can be thought of as\nwhere \u2206\nthe renormalized value of the gap \u2206.\nThe exponential and Laguerre-function factors are\nboth slightly smaller than one for small values of \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ).\nThe qubit therefore experiences a small reduction in the\ncoupling (or 'tunnelling') between the states |\u2191i and |\u2193i\nin the weak-coupling limit (\u03bb \u226a h\u0304\u03c90 ). This decrease in\nthe renormalized value of \u2206 can be understood in terms\nof the qubit having to 'pull' the oscillator with it as it\ntunnels between the states |\u2191i and |\u2193i, which would slow\ndown the tunneling process. Note that the renormalized\ngap depends on the number of photons in the oscillator,\nwhich can lead to beating dynamics and other interest-\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\ning phenomena that occur when several values of n are\ninvolved [14, 15].\nIf we keep increasing \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ), without worrying about\nsatisfying the condition \u03bb \u226a h\u0304\u03c90 , we find that the Laguerre polynomial and therefore the renormalized qubit\ngap vanish at n different \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ) values (For example,\nfor n = 2 there are two values of \u03bb for which the renorE\ng\u2191\nmalized gap vanishes). At these points, the states n,\nE\ng\u2193 are completely decoupled. Apart from this\nand n,\nfeature, the renormalized gap decreases as a Gaussian\nfunction with increasing \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ). Note that while increasing \u03bb there is no point that can be seen as a 'critical\npoint' with a sudden change in behaviour. This situation\ncontrasts with what happens in the two calculations that\nwe shall discuss in the next two sections, and the meaning\nof the term critical point will become clearer there.\nOne might expect that the adiabatically-adjustingoscillator approximation would break down when \u03bb is\ncomparable to, or larger than, h\u0304\u03c90 (meaning that h\u0304\u03c90 is\nnot the largest energy scale in the Hamiltonian). The arguments in the previous paragraph might therefore seem\nof little significance. It turns out, however, that the results discussed above hold, even when \u03bb > h\u0304\u03c90 . The reason why the approximation of an adiabatically adjusting\noscillator is still valid in this case is that even though\nlarge changes in the oscillator's states can occur when\nthe qubit's state changes, these large changes involve very\nslow processes that are governed by the renormalized gap.\nThe oscillator can therefore adjust adiabatically to these\nslow processes. In other words, the condition that h\u0304\u03c90\nbe the largest energy scale in the Hamiltonian is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the validity of the\nadiabatically-adjusting-oscillator approximation.\n\nC.\n\nHigh-frequency, adiabatically adjusting qubit\n\nWe now take the limit where Eq is much larger than\nboth h\u0304\u03c90 and \u03bb (Some analysis of this case was given in\nRef. [15]). Similarly to what was done in Sec. III B, we\n\n\f5\nnow say that the qubit remains in the same energy eigenstate (ground or excited state), and this state changes\nadiabatically following the dynamics of the slow oscillator. We therefore start by finding the energy eigenstates\nof the (fast-adjusting) qubit for a given state of the (slow)\noscillator. Since the interaction between the qubit and\nthe oscillator is mediated by the oscillator's position operator x\u0302, we start the calculation by assuming that x has\na well-defined value and treat the effective Hamiltonian\n(obtained from \u0124q and \u0124int ):\n\u0124q,eff\n\nx\n\n\u01eb\n\u2206\n= \u2212 \u03c3\u0302x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302z + gx\u03c3\u0302z .\n2\n2\n\nEq,1|x = \u2212\n|gx i =\nEq,2|x =\n|ex i =\ntan \u03c6 =\n\n(16)\n\nWe can now take these results and use them to analyze\nthe behaviour of the oscillator. We note here that since\nthe variable x appears inside the square-root in the above\nexpressions, the operators x\u0302 and p\u0302 lead to a more transparent analysis than the operators \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 . We therefore use the operators x\u0302 and p\u0302 for the remainder of this\ncalculation.\nSince the qubit's energy depends on the oscillator's position x, the oscillator's effective potential now acquires\na new contribution (which depends on the qubit's state):\nVeff (x) =\n\n1\n1p 2\n\u2206 + (\u01eb \u2212 2gx)2 .\nm\u03c902 x2 \u00b1\n2\n2\n\nwhere\n\u03c9\u030302 = \u03c902 \u00b1 2\n\n(15)\n\nThe eigenvalues and eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are\ngiven by:\n1p 2\n\u2206 + (\u01eb \u2212 2gx)2\n2\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\ncos |\u2191i + sin |\u2193i\n2\n2\n1p 2\n\u2206 + (\u01eb \u2212 2gx)2\n2\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nsin |\u2191i \u2212 cos |\u2193i\n2\n2\n\u2206\n.\n\u01eb \u2212 2gx\n\nIn the limit Eq \u226b g|x| for the relevant values of x, the\neffective potential in Eq.

In addition to the above effect\nof the qubit on the oscillator, the qubit's state changes\nas the oscillator's position changes, and the oscillator's\nkinetic-energy term will also be modified in principle (this\neffect is similar to the renormalization of \u2206 encountered\nin Sec. III B). However, for a sufficiently high-frequency\nqubit, changes in the qubit's state will be small (see Appendix A), and consequently the change in the kineticenergy term can be neglected.\nWe now note that the effective potential in Eq. (17)\nis no longer a harmonic potential. The second term describes one of the two branches of a hyperbola, depending\non the qubit's state. It will therefore not be possible to\nderive general analytical results, and we have to start\nconsidering some special cases.\n\ng2\n.\nmEq\n\n(19)\n\nThe oscillator's effective potential is modified in two ways\ndepending on the qubit's state. Firstly, the location of\nthe minimum is shifted to the left or right by a distance\nproportional to \u01eb/Eq = sin \u03b8 (This effect is absent when\nthe qubit is biased at the degeneracy point, where \u01eb = 0).\nSecondly, the oscillator's frequency is renormalized: According to Eq. (19), the oscillator's effective frequency is\nincreased for the qubit's excited state and reduced for the\nqubit's ground state (This phenomenon is the basis of the\nso-called quantum-capacitance and quantum-inductance\nqubit-readout techniques [27]).\nAn interesting result appears when one considers the\ncase where the qubit is in its ground state and\n2g 2\n> 1,\nm\u03c902 Eq\n\ni.e.\n\n4\u03bb2\n> 1.\nh\u0304\u03c90 Eq\n\n(20)\n\nIn this case the renormalized frequency becomes imaginary. This result signals the presence of a critical point\nabove which there is an instability in the system. In particular, our expansion of the square-root in Eq. (18) is\nno longer valid, the reason being that x would increase\nindefinitely under this approximation and the condition\nEq \u226b g|x| would be violated.\nThe instability obtained above would raise questions\nabout the validity of the assumption of an adiabatically\nadjusting qubit above the critical point. Nevertheless, we\nshall not worry about this point now, and we continue\nthe calculation. As a first step, we note that Veff (x) in\nEq. (17) is well behaved at |x| \u2192 \u221e. In particular,\n1\n\u01eb\nm\u03c902 x2 \u00b1 gx \u2212\n2\n2\n\n\u2206 |\u01eb|\n, .\ng g\n(21)\nWe can therefore proceed with the calculation using the\neffective potential given in Eq. (17).\nIn order to make a few more statements about the\ncase of strong coupling (i.e. above the critical point), it\nis useful to start with the case \u01eb = 0 and include a finite\nbias afterwards. When \u01eb = 0, the oscillator's effective\npotential takes the form\n\uf8f1\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 21 m\u03c902 \u00b1 g\u2206 x2 \u00b1 \u2206\n2 , x \u226a \u2206/g\n(22)\nVeff (x) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1\n2 2\n, x \u226b \u2206/g\n2 m\u03c90 x \u00b1 |gx|\nVeff (x) =\n\nwhen\n\n|x| \u226b\n\n\f6\nFor the case with the qubit in its excited state (i.e. when\none has the plus signs in the above expressions), the\neffective potential is a slightly non-harmonic potential, and one can expect the oscillator states to look\nmore or less like the usual harmonic oscillator states.\nFor the case with the qubit in its ground state, and\nwhen 2g 2 /(m\u03c902 \u2206) \u226a 1, one also has a slightly nonharmonic potential. For the qubit's ground state and\n2g 2 /(m\u03c902 \u2206) > 1 (which implies crossing the critical\npoint), the oscillator's effective potential is a double-well\npotential. The locations of the minima can be obtained\nby setting dVeff /dx = 0 with Veff given by Eq. (17): the\nminima are located at \u00b1x0 , with\ns\ng2\n\u22062\nx0 =\n\u2212 2.\n(23)\n4\n2\nm \u03c90\n4g\nIf one goes well beyond the critical point, the above expression reduces to\nx0 \u2248\n\ng\n,\nm\u03c902\n\n(24)\n\nthe two wells. In order to cause localization in the energy\neigenstates, \u01eb has to be larger than the energy separation\nwithin one of the energy-level pairs discussed above, i.e. \u01eb\nneeds to be larger than a quantity that is exponentially\nsmall in g 2 /(m\u03c903 h\u0304). Clearly, this localization happens at\nsmaller values of \u01eb as one goes deeper into the bistability\nregion. This result means that the superpositions involving both wells become increasingly fragile with increasing\ncoupling strength.\nFinally we note that above the critical point, one finds\nthat the condition Eq \u226b g|x| can no longer be satisfied\nfor any of the energy eigenstates. Therefore, one might\nexpect that the present approximation cannot be trusted.\nAs we discussed in Sec. III B, however, the above results\nhold even when \u03bb > Eq . In that case the energy eigenstates are either localized close to one of the local minima\nor involve very slow tunneling between the two wells of\nthe effective double-well potential. The qubit can adjust\nadiabatically to such slow tunneling processes. It is worth\nmentioning here that when \u03bb is the largest energy scale\nin the Hamiltonian, the approximations of this section\nand Sec. III B are both valid, and either one of the two\napproaches can be used to answer any given question.\n\nwith minimum potential energy [measured relative to\nVeff (0)]\nVmin\n\ng2\n= Veff (\u00b1x0 ) \u2212 Veff (0) \u2248 \u2212\n,\n2m\u03c902\n\nD.\n\n(25)\n\nand curvature\nd2 Veff\ndx2\n\nx=\u00b1x0\n\n\u2248 m\u03c902 .\n\nSemiclassical calculation\n\n(26)\n\nNote that this curvature is identical to that of the free\noscillator (i.e. when g = 0).\nOne can use the above expressions to estimate the energy separation between the ground state and first excited state above the critical point. These two states\nwill be the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions\nof the ground states localized around the two minima in\nthe double-well potential. The distance between the two\nminima is given by 2x0 from Eq. (24), and the height\nof the energy barrier separating the two minima is given\nby \u2212Vmin from Eq. (25). Using the Wentzel-KramersBrillouin (WKB) formula, one finds that the energy separation between the two lowest states (and also within\nsimilar pairs of\u221ahigher energy levels) is exponential in\nthe parameter \u2212mVmin x0 /h\u0304, which is proportional to\ng 2 /(m\u03c903 h\u0304), or alternatively \u03bb2 /(h\u0304\u03c90 )2 . This scaling is\nthe same as the one obtained in Sec. III B.\nWe now introduce \u01eb to the problem. Far below the\ncritical point, the effect of \u01eb can be obtained easily from\nEq. (18): the location of the minimum in the single-well\neffective potential is slightly shifted to the left or right.\nMore care is required above the critical point, where one\nhas the double-well effective potential. In this case, a finite value of \u01eb breaks the symmetry between the left and\nright wells, thus giving an energetic preference for one of\n\nA semiclassical calculation can go as follows (alternative semiclassical calculations can be found in [10, 13,\n15]): The five different variables x, p, \u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z are\ntreated as classical variables whose dynamics obeys the\nHamiltonian in Eqs. (1) and (2), without the hats. These\nvariables obey the constraint C = \u03c3x2 + \u03c3y2 + \u03c3z2 = 1. One\ncan therefore find the ground state relatively easily by\nminimizing the Hamiltonian under the above constraint.\nMinimizing the function H\u0303 = H \u2212 \u03bcC, with \u03bc being a\nLagrange multiplier, results in the set of equations\ndH\u0303\n= m\u03c902 x + g\u03c3z = 0\ndx\np\ndH\u0303\n=\n=0\ndp\nm\n\u2206\ndH\u0303\n= \u2212 \u2212 2\u03bc\u03c3x = 0\nd\u03c3x\n2\ndH\u0303\n= \u22122\u03bc\u03c3y = 0\nd\u03c3y\n\n(27)\n\ndH\u0303\n\u01eb\n= \u2212 + gx \u2212 2\u03bc\u03c3z = 0,\nd\u03c3z\n2\nwhich are to be solved under the constraint \u03c3x2 +\u03c3y2 +\u03c3z2 =\n1. The first four equations lead to x = \u2212g\u03c3z /(m\u03c902 ),\np = 0, \u03bcp= \u2212\u2206/(4\u03c3x ), and \u03c3y = 0. The constraint gives\n\u03c3x = \u00b1 1 \u2212 \u03c3z2 . One is therefore left with the equation\n\u2212\n\n\u01eb\n\u2206\u03c3z\ng 2 \u03c3z\n= 0,\n\u00b1 p\n\u2212\n2\n2 m\u03c90\n2 1 \u2212 \u03c3z2\n\n(28)\n\n\f7\nwhich can be re-expressed as\n\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2206\n\n1\n2g 2\n\u00b1p\n2\nm\u03c90 \u2206\n1 \u2212 \u03c3z2\n\n(a)\n!\n\n(b)\n\nVeff\n\n\u01eb/\u2206\n\n\u03c3z = 0.\n\n(29)\n\nThe above equation cannot be solved in closed form, in\ngeneral. However, one can make some general statements about the solution (see Fig. 2). For the plus sign\n(Fig. 2a), the second term in Eq. (29) is a monotonically\ndecreasing function that approaches +\u221e when \u03c3z \u2192 \u22121\nand approaches \u2212\u221e when \u03c3z \u2192 1. There is therefore\none solution to the equation in that case. It turns out\nthat this solution does not correspond to the ground state\n(This fact can be seen as simply a result of comparing the\nenergies of the different solutions). The ground state is\nobtained when using the minus sign. In this case, there\nare three possibilities: The first possibility is to have\n2g 2 < m\u03c902 \u2206. In this case (Fig. 2c), we find that the\nsecond term in Eq. (29) is a monotonically increasing\nfunction that approaches \u2212\u221e when \u03c3z \u2192 \u22121 and approaches +\u221e when \u03c3z \u2192 1. There is therefore only one\nsolution to Eq. (29). The second and third possibilities\nfor the solutions of Eq. (29) occur when 2g 2 > m\u03c902 \u2206. In\nthis case (Figs. 2e and 2g), the second term in Eq. (29)\ndevelops a local maximum and a local minimum between\n\u03c3z = \u22121 and \u03c3z = 1. Depending on the value of \u01eb,\nthere can be either one or three solutions. In particular,\nwhen \u01eb = 0, the three solutions are given by \u03c3z = 0,\nwhich turns\np out to be an unstable stationary point, and\n\u03c3z = \u00b1 1 \u2212 (m\u03c902 \u2206/2g 2 )2 , which are two degenerate\nground states (It is easy to verify that this result agrees\nwith Eq. 23).\nOne can intuitively understand the effect of having a\nfinite value of \u01eb using the language of Sec. III C. For\n\u01eb = 0, one has an effective trapping potential for the variable x, and this potential has the shape of a harmonicoscillator-like single-well potential when 2g 2 < m\u03c902 \u2206\nand a double-well potential when 2g 2 > m\u03c902 \u2206. This situation explains the existence of one ground state when\n2g 2 < m\u03c902 \u2206 and two degenerate ground states when\n2g 2 > m\u03c902 \u2206. The effect of adding \u01eb to the problem is to\ncreate a tilt in the effective trapping potential; a positive\nvalue of \u01eb favours the negative-x solution (here we have\nin mind the ground-state solution). If the tilt is weak,\none has a global minimum in the deeper well and a local minimum in the shallower well. If the tilt exceeds a\ncertain critical value, the shallow well is eliminated, and\none recovers a single-well potential.\nWe make a final note on the fact that we started the\ncalculation by raising a question related to the ground\nstate but found multiple solutions. The reason for this result is the fact that Eq. (27) locates all stationary points,\nand not only the ground state. The calculation therefore identifies both the ground state and also high-energy\nstationary points that are either dynamically unstable\nor dynamically stable but can still relax to lower-energy\nstates.\n\nx\n\n\u03c3z\nf(\u03c3z )\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nVeff\n\n\u01eb/\u2206\nx\n\n\u03c3z\nf(\u03c3z )\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nVeff\n\n\u01eb/\u2206\nx\n\n\u03c3z\nf(\u03c3z )\n\n(g)\n\n(h)\n\n\u01eb/\u2206\n\nVeff\n\n\u03c3z\n\nx\n\nf(\u03c3z )\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Graphical solution of Eq.

The standard perturbation-theory procedure is well suited for the weak-coupling limit. One can\nuse it to systematically obtain accurate approximations\nfor the energy eigenstates and dynamics of the system.\nThe two approximations involving one subsystem, either\nthe qubit or the oscillator, adjusting adiabatically to the\nslow dynamics of the other one are based on the conceptual picture of the separation between different time\nscales in the problem. As formulated above, they involve only one level of approximation, in contrast to\n\n\f8\nthe order-by-order expansion involved in perturbation\ntheory. The time-scale-separation-based approximations\ncan, however, be constructed formally as the lowest-order\napproximation in a systematic procedure sometimes referred to as adiabatic elimination of fast variables [28]\nor Van Vleck perturbation theory [29]. The semiclassical\ncalculation treats the dynamical variables classically and\nis at first sight not related to any specific approximation\nrelated to the system parameters.\nThe weak-coupling approximation is suited for studying the excitation-exchange dynamics between the qubit\nand oscillator, but it does not give any hint of an instability in the system. The main result of the adiabaticallyadjusting-oscillator approximation is the renormalized\nqubit gap. Apart from the oscillatory behaviour in the\ngap, the Gaussian-function decrease at large \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ) values is a signature of the strong entanglement between the\nqubit and the oscillator in the energy eigenstates. Nevertheless, no 'critical point', i.e. a point that is associated with a sudden change in any of the effective qubit\nparameters (particularly the renormalized gap), is obtained in that calculation. The adiabatically-adjustingqubit approximation predicts a reduced effective oscillator frequency for weak coupling (and assuming that the\nqubit is in its ground state), and a qualitative change in\nbehaviour upon crossing the critical point\n4\u03bb2\n= 1.\nh\u0304\u03c90 Eq\n\n(30)\n\nAbove the critical point, the energy eigenstates can\nbe highly entangled qubit-oscillator states.\nAs in\nthe adiabatically-adjusting-oscillator approximation, the\nseparation between neighbouring energy levels is found\nto follow a Gaussian-function dependence in the parameter \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ). The adiabatically-adjusting-oscillator and\nadiabatically-adjusting-qubit approximations give different predictions regarding the typical value of \u03bb at which\nthe Gaussian-function decrease in energy separation\nstarts:\nthe former gives \u03bb \u223c h\u0304\u03c90 and the latter gives \u03bb \u223c\n\u221a\nh\u0304\u03c90 \u2206. The semiclassical calculation produces the same\ncritical-point condition as the adiabatically-adjustingqubit approximation. Even though the semiclassical calculation naturally cannot produce any entangled-state\nsolutions, its results can be used as a starting point for\nstudying quantum superpositions of the different semiclassical solutions.\nOne could understand the reason for the absence of a\ncritical point in the case of a high-frequency oscillator as\nhaving to do with the pairing of energy levels. In this\ncase, the energy levels form pairs all the way from \u03bb = 0\nto \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. In contrast, in the case of a high-frequency\nqubit the low-lying levels are equally spaced for small\nvalues of \u03bb. As \u03bb increases, the energy levels start approaching each other while remaining equally spaced, a\nsituation that corresponds to a decreasing renormalized\noscillator frequency. At the point where the energy levels are expected to collapse to a single, highly degenerate\nenergy level, they pair up and the different pairs start\n\nmoving away from each other. The energy levels now\nresemble those of an increasingly deep double-well potential. Thus the energy levels and energy eigenstates\nexhibit two qualitatively different structures below and\nabove the critical point.\nIt is worth mentioning that the adiabaticallyadjusting-oscillator and adiabatically-adjusting-qubit approximations start with similar, or symmetric, reasoning.\nThe asymmetry in the results is mainly due to the different dependence in the energy levels and energy eigenstates of the fast subsystem on the state of the slow subsystem. In the case of a fast qubit, the qubit's energy\nproduces the largest effect on the slow oscillator. In the\ncase of a fast oscillator, the oscillator's energy does not\ndepend on the state of the qubit, and only the changes\nin the energy eigenstates lead to effective changes to the\nbehaviour of the slow qubit.\nOne might wonder why the results of the semiclassical\ncalculation agree with those of the high-frequency-qubit\napproximation. This agreement can be understood by\nnoting first that the oscillator has continuous variables,\nsuch that it is conceivable that certain states will be described to a good approximation using classical variables\n(In this context one can think of coherent states, which\nto a good approximation behave classically). When the\nqubit's frequency is high, it is also conceivable that the\nqubit's state, which for example follows the instantaneous\nground state, can be described by the classical variables\nthat specify the instantaneous ground state. In this case,\none can expect the semiclassical calculation to give good\nresults. One can also use this argument to conclude that\na phase-transition-like singularity will occur in the limit\nh\u0304\u03c90 /Eq \u2192 0, where the semiclassical calculation can be\nexpected to give exact results. In contrast, in the limit\nof a low-frequency qubit, the dynamics will necessarily\nbe described by the coupling of two discrete quantum\nstates, and this situation cannot be described well using\na semiclassical approximation.\nIn the context of discussing the phase-transition-like\nbifurcation in this system, it is worth mentioning a related system with a true phase transition: the Dicke\nmodel [30]. If one replaces the single qubit by a large\nnumber of qubits with equal values of Eq , all coupled\nto the same cavity with the same value of \u03bb, then by\ntaking the appropriate thermodynamic limit (N \u2192 \u221e,\n\u03bb2 N = \u03bb\u03032 ) one finds a phase transition between states\nsimilar to those discussed above [31]. The critical point\nis given by the condition 4\u03bb\u03032 = h\u0304\u03c90 Eq , in analogy to the\ncritical-point condition discussed in Secs. III C and III D.\nIn contrast to the single-qubit case, however, the phase\ntransition now occurs regardless of the relation between\nthe qubit and oscillator frequencies. Note that the qubits\nbehave collectively as a single large spin in this case (and\nfor low-lying states a large spin behaves similarly to a\nharmonic oscillator), such that the entire system can be\napproximated by two coupled oscillators. Note also that\nthe semiclassical calculation arises naturally in this case:\nwhen the effective spin has an infinite number of allowed\n\n\f9\nstates, it is natural to make a classical approximation\nwhere fluctuations in the spin are small compared to the\ntotal size of the available state space.\n\nNUMERICAL CALCULATIONS\n\n2\nEn /h\u0304\u03c90\n\nIV.\n\n4\n\nIn this section we present results of numerical calculations that demonstrate the properties of the system in the\ndifferent parameter regimes. In particular, we perform\ncalculations for the resonant case, the high-frequencyoscillator case and the high-frequency-qubit case. We\nalso vary the qubit bias \u01eb, or alternatively the angle \u03b8, in\norder to analyze its effect on the properties of the system.\n\n(a)\n\n\u22126\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n2\n\n4\n2\nEn /h\u0304\u03c90\n\nEnergy-level spectrum\n\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the energies of the lowest ten levels as\na function of the coupling strength \u03bb in the resonant case\nh\u0304\u03c90 = Eq . When \u01eb = \u03bb = 0, the ground state is nondegenerate and each higher energy level is doubly degenerate. The separation between the levels is h\u0304\u03c90 , which\nis also equal to Eq . As \u03bb increases, the energy levels\nshift up or down, and several avoided crossings are encountered. In the large \u03bb limit, all energy levels become\ndoubly degenerate (i.e. they form pairs), including the\nground state. The separation between the different pairs\nof energy levels in this limit is again h\u0304\u03c90 . These results\nagree with the picture of the effective double-well potential of Sec. III C. For a small but finite bias \u01eb (i.e. small\nbut finite \u03b8) and small coupling strength \u03bb, the overall\nenergy level structure is similar to that in the \u01eb = 0 case,\nexcept that the levels do not approach each other as much\nat the avoided crossings. In the large \u03bb limit, there are\nno degeneracies: the energy levels are separated by the\nalternate distances \u01eb and h\u0304\u03c90 \u2212 \u01eb. This structure reflects\nthe small asymmetry in the double-well potential caused\nby a small tilt. For large \u03b8 (i.e. sin \u03b8 \u223c 1), all features\nin the spectrum are suppressed, except for the overall\ndecrease in the energy with increasing \u03bb.\nIn order to examine the strong-coupling limit more\nclosely, in Fig. 4 we plot the energy-level separation between the lowest two energy levels. The results agree with\nthe predictions of Eq. (13): deep in the strong-coupling\nregime, the separation within the pairs of energy levels\nis given by E2n+2 \u2212 E2n+1 \u223c (\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 )n exp{\u22122(\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 )2 }\nfor \u01eb = 0 and by \u01eb for \u01eb 6= 0.\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the energies of the lowest ten levels\nas a function of \u03bb in the case of a high-frequency oscillator, i.e. when Eq \u226a h\u0304\u03c90 . As explained in Sec. III B, if\none considers a pair of energy levels, e.g. the lowest two\nenergy levels, one has a modified effective qubit Hamiltonian. When \u03bb = 0, one recovers the bare qubit Hamiltonian. As \u03bb increases, the effective qubit gap \u2206 decreases\nand approaches zero in the limit \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ) \u2192 \u221e. In Fig. 6\nwe plot the separations within the four lowest pairs of\nenergy levels.

Note that\nthe location of the peaks does not change, but the effect of the gap on the energy levels becomes smaller with\nincreasing \u03b8.\nIn Fig. 7 we plot the energies of the lowest ten levels\nas a function of \u03bb in the case of a high-frequency qubit,\n\n\f10\n4\n2\nEn /h\u0304\u03c90\n\n(E2 \u2212 E1 )/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\u22122\n\n(a)\n\n\u22124\n0\n\nlog[\u2212 log(y)]\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n\u22126\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Lowest ten energy levels in the case of\na high-frequency oscillator; h\u0304\u03c90 /Eq = 10.

III (We could extend the range of agreement by plotting\nlog[log(\u2206/h\u0304\u03c90 )\u2212log(y)]; however, we are mostly interested in\ndemonstrating the agreement for large values of x, where this\nmodification would have little effect on the shape of the blue\ncurve). Similar figures can be generated for the other values\nof h\u0304\u03c90 /Eq . However, we do not show such figures here.\n\nOne obvious possibility for the preparation of squeezed,\nentangled or Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states in the case of ultrastrong coupling is to have a ground state that exhibits\none of these unusual properties. With this point in mind,\nin this section we analyze the oscillator's squeezing and\ncat-ness as well as the qubit-oscillator entanglement in\nthe ground state for different choices of system parameters.\nAs a first step, we plot the Q function and the Wigner\nfunction of the oscillator's state in the ground state of\nthe coupled system. The Q function is given by\nQ(X, P ) =\n\n1\nhX + iP | \u03c1osc |X + iP i ,\n\u03c0\n\nwhere \u03c1osc is the oscillator's reduced density matrix after tracing out the qubit from the ground state, \u03c1osc =\nTrq {|\u03a8GS i h\u03a8GS |} with |\u03a8GS i being the ground state of\nthe combined system, and the bra and ket in the above\nformula are coherent states:\n|\u03b1i = exp{\u03b1\u00e2\u2020 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u00e2} |0i .\n\ni.e. when Eq \u226b h\u0304\u03c90 . The most dramatic effects occur\nfor \u03b8 = 0. The ground-state energy\n\u221a remains essentially\nconstant between \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb = h\u0304\u03c90 \u2206/2. Beyond this\npoint the ground-state energy decreases indefinitely with\nincreasing \u03bb. Furthermore, below the critical point, the\nlow-lying energy levels approach each other with increasing \u03bb as if they were going to collapse to one point, as\nwould be expected for a vanishing \u03c9\u03030 . Above the critical\npoint, the energy levels form pairs whose intra-pair separation decreases with increasing \u03bb. The above scenario\nis suppressed as \u03b8 is increased. There is no longer any\nsign of a critical point, and the energy-level separations\nare independent of \u03bb.\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nThe state |0i represents the vacuum state with the oscillator in its ground state.

For small values of \u03bb,\nthe squeezing increases with increasing \u03bb. However,\nas \u03bb increases further and the ground state becomes\nmore and more entangled, the squeezing is lost. The\nmaximum achievable squeezing is largest for the case of\na high-frequency qubit, h\u0304\u03c90 \u226a \u2206. Indeed, as explained\nin Sec. III C, the oscillator's effective potential becomes\n\n\f13\n1\n(a)\n\nS\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n(b)\n\nS\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\n\n2\n\n1\n(c)\n\n0.5\n\nS\n\nflatter and flatter as one approaches the critical point,\nleading to a momentum squeezing parameter close to\n\u22121.\nAs |sp | increases, one can ask whether the oscillator's\nstate is a quadrature-squeezed, minimum-uncertainty\nstate or it deviates from this ideal squeezed state. The\nanswer to this question can be obtained by analyzing the\nparameter K. We do not show any plots of this parameter here. The main results are as follows: For the case\n\u01eb = 0, K increases slowly and remains close to h\u03042 /4 as\nsp increases, but near the maximum squeezing point, K\nstarts increasing rapidly and diverges for \u03bb/(h\u0304\u03c90 ) \u2192 \u221e.\nFor finite values of \u01eb, K increases slightly above h\u03042 /4,\nbut then turns and goes back to h\u03042 /4 as sp goes back to\nzero in the strong-coupling limit.\nWe have seen that squeezed states are obtained for\nweak to moderate coupling. The question now is what\nstates we have for strong coupling. The Q functions\nand the sp and K results discussed above do not distinguish between a Schr\u00f6dinger-cat state in the oscillator and a qubit-oscillator entangled state. The Wigner\nfunction has negative values for moderately strong coupling (Figs. 8d and 8f), indicating nonclassical states of\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger-cat type (Note that quadrature-squeezed\nstates have nonnegative Wigner functions). In order to\ndistinguish more clearly between Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states\nin the oscillator and qubit-oscillator entangled states, we\nnow analyze the entanglement properties in the ground\nstate.\nThe entanglement is quantified by the entropy S of the\nqubit's state. This quantity is obtained by calculating the\nground state of the combined system |\u03a8GS i, using it to\nobtain the qubit's reduced density matrix in the ground\nstate \u03c1q = Trosc {|\u03a8GS i h\u03a8GS |}, and then evaluating the\nentropy of that state S = \u2212Tr{\u03c1q log2 \u03c1q }.\nIn Fig. 10 we plot the qubit's ground-state entropy as a\nfunction of \u03bb. For \u01eb = 0 the entropy increases from zero\nto one as \u03bb increases from zero to values much larger\nthan all other parameters in the problem. Demonstrating the fragility of the entangled states in the large-\u03bb\nlimit, Fig. 10 shows that the entanglement drops rapidly\n(especially for large values of \u03bb) when \u01eb is increased.\nBy comparing Figs. 9 and 10, we can see that the rise\nin the qubit-oscillator entanglement is correlated with\nthe reversal of the squeezing. One therefore goes from a\nsqueezed state in the oscillator to a qubit-oscillator entangled state. We do not find any set of parameters where\nthe ground state contains an unentangled Schr\u00f6dingercat state in the oscillator.\nThe numerical results show that the case h\u0304\u03c90 \u226a Eq is\nmost suited for the preparation of squeezed states, as can\nbe seen by comparing the maximum achievable squeezing in the different parameter regimes. The opposite case\n(h\u0304\u03c90 \u226b Eq ) is most suited for the preparation of entangled states, as seen from the extreme fragility of these\nstates for the case h\u0304\u03c90 \u226a Eq . In fact, all the nonclassical properties of the ground state are suppressed as \u01eb\nis increased from zero to values larger than \u2206.

For\n\u01eb = 0 the qubit-oscillator entanglement increases from zero to\none as \u03bb is increased, regardless of the relation between h\u0304\u03c90\nand Eq . However, the entanglement drops rapidly (especially\nfor large values of \u03bb) as \u01eb is increased, i.e. when the qubit is\nmoved away from the degeneracy point.\n\ncome back to this point in Sec. VI.\nIn Fig. 11 we examine the value of \u03bb at which the\nqubit's ground-state entropy has the values 0.1 and 0.5.\nThese curves serve as indicators for the onset of qubitoscillator entanglement, which is related to the instability encountered in the semi-classical calculation.

PREPARATION AND DETECTION OF\nNONCLASSICAL STATES THROUGH IN-SITU\nPARAMETER AND STATE MANIPULATION\n\nWe have seen in Sec. IV that oscillator squeezed states\nand qubit-oscillator entangled states can occur naturally as ground states of the strongly coupled system.\nSchr\u00f6dinger-cat states in the oscillator, i.e. not involving entanglement with the qubit, do not occur as ground\nstates of this system.\nOne method that has been proposed for the generation\nof oscillator Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states in the context of cavity QED [2] can be considered here as well: One prepares\na qubit-oscillator entangled state of the form\n1\n\u221a (|\u03b1i \u2297 |q1 i + |\u2212\u03b1i \u2297 |q2 i) ,\n2\n\n(35)\n\nwith |q1 i and |q2 i being any two orthogonal qubit states\nand |\u00b1\u03b1i being coherent states of the oscillator with a\nlarge value of\u221a |\u03b1|. One now measures the qubit in the\n(|q1 i \u00b1 |q2 i)/ 2 basis. Depending on the outcome of the\nmeasurement, the state of the oscillator is projected into\none of the two states\n1\n\u221a (|\u03b1i \u00b1 |\u2212\u03b1i) ,\n2\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\nwith \u03b1 = x0 , the above procedure could also be implemented in the system under consideration (We shall also\ngive an alternative procedure below). Hence all three\ntypes of nonclassical states that we consider in this paper can be generated in principle.\nOne important question that arises in the case of strong\nqubit-oscillator coupling is whether it is possible to detect the nonclassical states in spite of the always-present\nstrong coupling. The answer is yes, in principle. An important point to note in this context is that, as shown\nin Secs. III and IV, the energy eigenstates of the system\nare approximately product states when the qubit is biased far from the degeneracy point, i.e. for large values of\n\u01eb. One could therefore say that, for certain procedures,\nthe qubit and oscillator can be made to effectively decouple from each other by biasing the qubit away from the\ndegeneracy point.\nWe now discuss some possible procedures for the experimental observation of the different nonclassical states.\nSince all three types of nonclassical states occur in the\ncase of a high-frequency, adiabatically adjusting qubit,\nwe focus on this case. An experiment could start by\npreparing the ground state with the qubit biased at the\ndegeneracy point. Under suitable conditions, this step\ncould be achieved by biasing the qubit at the degeneracy\npoint and letting the system relax to its ground state.\nThe state would then be either a squeezed state or an entangled state, depending on the coupling strength. One\ncould then move the qubit away from the degeneracy\npoint for measurement purposes. If the change is slow on\nthe timescales of both the qubit and the oscillator, the\nsystem will remain close to its ground state, adiabatically\nfollowing the bias-point shift (There might be substantial excitation out of the ground state in the double-well\nregime where the separation between the lowest energy\nlevels is small; however, this situation will come to an end\nwhen the double-well potential transforms into a singlewell potential). If the system follows its instantaneous\nground state during the bias-point sweep, the nonclassical state will be lost. The sweep therefore has to be\nfast at least compared to the period of the oscillator. If\nthe sweep is adiabatic with respect to the qubit but fast\nwith respect to the oscillator, the qubit will follow the\nchange adiabatically, while the oscillator will be frozen\nin its initial state. In the case where the initial ground\nstate is a squeezed state, one would achieve the effective\nqubit-oscillator decoupling while preserving the squeezed\nstate for the measurement step of the experiment. In the\ncase where the initial ground state is (approximately) the\nentangled state given in Eq. (37), the qubit will end up\nin its ground state at the final bias point, and this state\nwill be independent of the state of the oscillator. As a\n\n\f15\nresult, the oscillator is left in a Schr\u00f6dinger-cat state. If\nthe bias-point sweep is fast on both the qubit and oscillator timescales, both subsystems will be frozen in their\ninitial state during the sweep, such that one ends up with\nan entangled state at the end of the sweep.\nThe state of the oscillator can be reconstructed using\nWigner tomography, which could be implemented following the experiment in Ref. [21]. In that experiment, the\noscillator was put into resonance with a qubit that was\ninitialized in its ground state, and the excitation probability of the qubit as a function of time was determined by\nperforming an ensemble of measurements. By decomposing the signal into its Fourier components, it was possible to extract the occupation probabilities of the different\nphoton-number states. When combined with the ability\nto shift the oscillator's state (through the application of\na classical driving signal) before the measurement, full\nWigner tomography becomes possible. In the case of a\nlow-frequency oscillator, the transfer of excitations between the qubit and the oscillator can be induced by\ndriving the red or blue sideband, as was done in the experiment of Ref. [3]. Since, as explained above, the qubit\nis effectively decoupled from the resonator when \u01eb \u226b \u2206,\nthe exchange of excitations between the qubit and the\noscillator would not be efficient at the measurement bias\npoint, which seems to pose a dilemma for the proposed\nexperiment. This difficulty can be circumvented, however, by using a second, weakly coupled qubit for measurement purposes.\nWigner tomography can be used to demonstrate\nsqueezed and Schr\u00f6dinger-cat states in the oscillator.\nQubit-oscillator entangled states could be demonstrated\nby measuring the correlation between the states of the\nqubit and oscillator. Starting from the ground state, if\nthe qubit is measured and found to be in the state |\u2191i, the\noscillator must be in the state |\u2212\u03b1i, with \u03b1 = x0 . If the\nqubit is found to be in the state |\u2193i, the oscillator must\nbe in the state |\u03b1i. The observation of only these correlations, however, is not sufficient in order to establish\nthe presence of quantum correlations. For that purpose\none has to perform measurements in more than one set\n\u221aof\nbases. The additional qubit basis can be (|\u2191i \u00b1 |\u2193i)/\n2:\n\u221a\n2,\nthe\nIf the qubit is found to be in the state (|\u2191i + |\u2193i)/\n\u221a\noscillator must be in the state (|\u03b1i + |\u2212\u03b1i)/ 2, and a\nsimilar relation\n\u221aholds for the minus signs. The two states\n(|\u03b1i \u00b1 |\u2212\u03b1i)/ 2 can be distinguished through the fact\nthat the state with the plus sign contains only even photon numbers while the state with the minus sign contains\nonly odd photon numbers.\nFinally it should be noted that after the bias-point\nsweep, the resulting state would not be a stationary state\nand would therefore have a time dependence. This time\ndependence has to be taken into account in the measurement sequence. Furthermore, when the qubit is biased\nsuch that it is in one of the two \u03c3\u0302z eigenstates, say |\u2191i,\nthe effective oscillator potential will be shifted from the\npoint x = 0, and one must take into account this shift\nwhen analyzing the post-sweep dynamics.\n\nVI.\n\nDECOHERENCE\n\nWe now turn to the question of how coupling to the environment affects the prospects of preparing and observing nonclassical states in the system under consideration.\nFollowing a standard procedure [28, 32, 33], we analyze\nthe effects of the environment by first determining the\nenergy eigenstates of the system in isolation and then\nanalyzing the relaxation and dephasing rates that govern the decoherence between the different energy eigenstates. For our purposes it will be sufficient to consider\nMarkovian decoherence dynamics.\nSince the preparation of nonclassical states above required biasing the system at the point \u01eb = 0, we focus\non this case. In Secs. III and IV, we found two types\nof low-lying energy eigenstates, depending on the coupling strength. For small values of \u03bb, where the ground\nstate involves a squeezed state of the oscillator, the energy eigenstates are slightly modified from the energy\neigenstates in the absence of qubit-oscillator coupling.\nFor large values of \u03bb, the low-lying energy eigenstates\nare superpositions similar to that given in Eq. (37). As\nwe shall see below, there is a qualitative difference in how\nthese two types of states are affected by the environment.\nThe relaxation rate \u0393i\u2192j and the dephasing rate \u0393\u03c6,ij\ninvolving states i and j are given by [28, 32]\n\u0393i\u2192j =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0\nEi \u2212 Ej\n\u00d7 hi| \u00c2 |ji\nS\n2\nh\u0304\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0393\u03c6,ij = \u03c0S(0) \u00d7 hi| \u00c2 |ii \u2212 hj| \u00c2 |ji ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere S(\u03c9) is the environment's spectral density of the\nrelevant environment operator at frequency \u03c9, and \u00c2 is\nthe system operator through which the system couples\nto the environment.\nIn order to go further with the analysis, we need to\nspecify the operator \u00c2 that describes the coupling to the\nenvironment; there is one such operator for each decoherence channel. It was mentioned in the introduction that\nthe availability of the tuning parameter \u01eb can be seen\nas an advantage of solid-state qubits in comparison to\nnatural atoms in cavity QED. On the other hand, however, this property also opens an additional channel for\nnoise and the environment to couple to the system. The\noperator associated with the parameter \u01eb is \u03c3\u0302z , and the\ncoupling through this operator is typically the most detrimental for superconducting qubit circuits. We therefore\nstart by considering this decoherence channel.\nFor coupling through the operator \u03c3\u0302z , the relaxation\nand dephasing rates are proportional to the quantities\n2\n2\n|hi| \u03c3\u0302z |ji| and |hi| \u03c3\u0302z |ii \u2212 hj| \u03c3\u0302z |ji| , respectively. For\n\u01eb = 0 and small \u03bb (and avoiding the resonant case), the\nenergy eigenstates are approximately product states with\nthe qubit being in an eigenstate of \u03c3\u0302x , to which we refer\nas |\u00b1i, and the oscillator having a certain number of\nphotons n. The above quantities are then approximately\n\n\f16\ngiven by the corresponding values for the qubit states:\nhn, +| \u03c3\u0302z |n\u2032 , \u2212i = \u03b4n,n\u2032\nhn, +| \u03c3\u0302z |n\u2032 , +i = hn, \u2212| \u03c3\u0302z |n\u2032 , \u2212i = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nThese expressions suggest that the system relaxes with\na rate equal to that of the isolated qubit. The vanishing of the dephasing rate in this approximation has the\nsame origin as its vanishing for an isolated qubit at the\ndegeneracy point, namely the fact that the energies are\ninsensitive to variations in \u01eb to first order. This property points out an important requirement for the above\nexpressions to be valid: the energy-level separation must\nbe much larger than the transverse fluctuations in the\nHamiltonian. These fluctuations, which are transverse\nat the degeneracy point, are responsible for dephasing\naway from the degeneracy point. As a result, in order\nto obtain the degeneracy-point protection from dephasing, the energy-level separation must be large compared\nto the dephasing rate when the latter is calculated away\nfrom the degeneracy point:\n2\n\n\u0393\u03c6,ij = \u03c0S(0) \u00d7 |hn, \u2191| \u03c3\u0302z |n, \u2191i \u2212 hn\u2032 , \u2193| \u03c3\u0302z |n\u2032 , \u2193i|\n= 4\u03c0S(0).\n(40)\nThis parameter is typically of the order of 100 MHz,\nwhich corresponds to a dephasing time of 10 ns. At the\ndegeneracy point, an isolated qubit is protected from this\nnoise because the qubit's gap is typically larger than 1\nGHz, and the qubit-environment coupling is transverse to\nthe qubit Hamiltonian. Similarly, mildly squeezed states\n(whose energy-level separations are comparable to those\nof the simple product states of the uncoupled system)\nshould be protected from dephasing caused by the weak,\ntransverse coupling to the environment. The situation is\nquite different for large values of \u03bb, where the low-lying\nstates are highly entangled states with a very small separation within an energy-level pair. For example, when\n\u01eb = 0, the lowest two energy eigenstates are given by\n1\n\u221a (|\u03b1i \u2297 |\u2193i \u00b1 |\u2212\u03b1i \u2297 |\u2191i) ,\n2\n\n(41)\n\nwith \u03b1 = x0 . The energy separation between these states\ncan be obtained from the WKB calculation of Sec. III C.\nWhen \u01eb exceeds this (possibly very small) energy separation, the energy eigenstates are simply the product\nstates |\u03b1i \u2297 |\u2193i and |\u2212\u03b1i \u2297 |\u2191i. In order for the entangled states to be robust against fluctuations in \u01eb, their\nenergy-level separation (at \u01eb = 0) must be much larger\nthan the qubit's dephasing rate of about 100 MHz. Since\nthe qubit and oscillator frequencies can be of the order of\n1 GHz, one could obtain an entangled ground state that\nis separated from the first excited state by 100 MHz or\nmore. For example, taking \u03bb = h\u0304\u03c90 = \u2206 = 1 GHz, we\nobtain a qubit ground-state entropy of 0.85 and an energy separation of 138 MHz. However, it would be highly\ndesirable to reduce the qubit decoherence rates, and in\nprinciple this should be possible in the future using better\nmaterials and circuit designs.\n\nEven though superconducting harmonic oscillators\ngenerally have much higher quality factors than superconducting qubits, it is instructive to briefly discuss the\neffect of oscillator decoherence. The oscillator typically\ncouples to its environment through the same operator\nthat describes its coupling to the qubit. In the present\nproblem, this operator is x\u0302, or equivalently \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 . In a\nfree oscillator, the relevant matrix element for purposes\nof determining the decoherence rates is given by\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\nhn| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n\u2032 i = n\u03b4n\u22121,n\u2032 + n + 1\u03b4n+1,n\u2032 . (42)\n\nUsing the relations for the relaxation and dephasing rates\nin Eq. (38), one finds that at low temperatures the effect\nof the environment is to cause decay to the ground state\nthrough the loss of photons; photons are lost one by one,\nwith a rate that is proportional\nto the photon number\n\u0001\n(Note that since hn| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |ni = 0, no pure dephasing\noccurs in this system). The photon-loss process is described by the jump operator \u00e2. In the strongly coupled\nqubit-oscillator system with the double-well effective potential, the effect of the environment will be drastically\ndifferent from the simple photon-loss dynamics. Since\nthe effective potential near each one of the local minima\nhas the same shape as the free-oscillator potential, the\nenergy eigenstates |n, \u00b1i will be entangled states where\nthe qubit is either in the state |\u2191i or |\u2193i, correlated with\nan oscillator wave function that is given simply by the\nfree-oscillator state |ni shifted to the left or right by a\ndistance x0 . One therefore finds the matrix elements\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u221a\nhn, \u00b1| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n\u2032 , \u00b1i = n\u03b4n\u22121,n\u2032 + n + 1\u03b4n+1,n\u2032\n\u0001\n(43)\nhn, +| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n\u2032 , \u2212i = 0.\nThe fact that the matrix elements in the first line coincide with those of the free oscillator implies that the\nrelaxation rate will be equal to the free-oscillator relaxation rate. Note that this process is no longer described\nby the jump operator \u00e2, but\nprather by a properly shifted\nannihilation operator, \u00e2 \u00b1 m\u03c90 /(2h\u0304)x0 , depending on\nwhether one is dealing with the left or right well in the\neffective double-well potential. The relaxation process\ndoes not change the state of the qubit, or any superposition involving the left and right wells. Even though the\nrelation\n\u0001\n(44)\nhn, \u00b1| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n, \u00b1i = 0\nwould suggest that no dephasing should occur between\nthe different energy eigenstates, the alternative basis with\nlocalized states {|n, \u2191i , |n, \u2193i gives\n\u0001\n\u0001\nhn, \u2191| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n, \u2191i \u2212 hn, \u2193| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n, \u2193i\n\n8m\u03c90 2\nx0 .\nh\u0304\n(45)\nThis result implies that the coupling to the environment will cause dephasing in any quantum superposition involving the two wells, with a tendency to localize the wave function in one of the wells. The rate\nof this process will be proportional to the product of\n2\n\n=\n\n\f17\nthe environment's power spectrum at zero frequency and\nthe combination of matrix elements given above. This\nlast quantity is proportional to x20 , and it grows indefinitely with increasing coupling strength. If we assume\nthat the power spectrum at zero frequency is comparable to that at the oscillator frequency, the dephasing rate can be much larger than the decay rate of the\nfree oscillator because of the largeness of the quantity\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\nhn, \u2191| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n, \u2191i \u2212 hn, \u2193| \u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 |n, \u2193i . For example taking the oscillator's decay rate to be 0.1-1 MHz and\n\u221a\nconsidering states where \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are of typical size 5\n(i.e. about five virtual photons in the ground state), we\nfind that the dephasing rate can be of the order of 10-100\nMHz, which is comparable to the \u03c3\u0302z -mediated dephasing\nrate.\nWe finally discuss the question of temperature. We\nhave considered the possibility of preparing nonclassical\nstates by letting the system cool down to its ground state.\nOne must therefore make sure that the energy-level separation between the ground state and the first excited\nstate is larger than the ambient temperature. In superconducting circuits, the temperature is typically around\n20 mK, which can be converted to roughly 1 GHz in\nfrequency units. The ground state must be separated\nfrom the excited states by at least that amount in order to achieve high-fidelity preparation of the ground\nstate. Typical qubit and oscillator frequencies are in\nthe few-gigahertz range, not much higher than typical\ntemperatures. Squeezed ground states in the oscillator\nshould be separated from the excited states by an energy comparable to the one present in the uncoupled system, implying that the preparation of these states should\nbe possible. The entangled ground states that occur for\nstrong coupling, however, are separated from the first excited states by energy gaps that decrease rapidly with increasing qubit-oscillator coupling strength. If this energy\ngap becomes smaller than the 1 GHz temperature level,\none would not be able to prepare the entangled ground\nstate simply by letting the system cool down to such a\nstate. However, one could let the system cool down to its\nground state away from the degeneracy point and then\nadiabatically shift the bias point to one with an entangled\nground state. Provided that the thermalization rate is\nsufficiently low, it is not necessary to have a degeneracypoint energy-level separation that is larger than the temperature. The 1 GHz temperature level should therefore\nnot be seen as a fundamental obstacle to the preparation\nof entangled ground states.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have analyzed the properties of a strongly coupled qubit-oscillator system, focusing on the potential\nof this system for the preparation of nonclassical states.\nThese states include squeezed states and Schr\u00f6dinger-cat\nstates of the oscillator, as well as qubit-oscillator entangled states.\n\nWe have compared the predictions of four different analytical approaches: the weak-coupling approximation, the adiabatically-adjusting-oscillator approximation, the adiabatically-adjusting-qubit approximation\nand the semiclassical calculation. Each one of these four\napproaches is well suited for analyzing the behaviour of\nthe system under a certain set of assumptions. Thus\nthe combination of the results provides a rather thorough understanding of the qubit-oscillator system in the\nregime of ultrastrong coupling. We have also presented\nresults of numerical calculations that reinforce the results\nof the analytical derivations. These results demonstrate\nthe nonclassical properties of the energy eigenstates, and\nespecially the ground state, of the system.\nWe have discussed various possible experimental procedures for the preparation and observation of nonclassical states. All three types of nonclassical states that\nwe discuss in this paper can be prepared and detected in\nprinciple.\nWe have also analyzed the effect of coupling to the\nenvironment on the system. We have shown that the decoherence dynamics of the coupled qubit-oscillator system can be qualitatively different from the decoherence\ndynamics of the qubit or oscillator in isolation. We\nhave shown that nonclassical states, particularly highlyentangled states, are highly susceptible to changes or\nfluctuations in the bias parameters. These results lead\nto the conclusion that high degrees of control and low\nnoise levels will be required for the preparation of robust\nnonclassical states in the ultrastrong-coupling regime.\nWe would like to thank P. Forn-Diaz, J. R. Johansson, N. Lambert and S. Shevchenko for useful discussions.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Army Research Office (ARO),\nthe Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant No. 0726909.\nNote added in proof: Recently ultrastrong coupling\nbetween a superconducting flux qubit and a coplanar\nwaveguide resonator has been demonstrated [34].\nAppendix A: Oscillator's effective kinetic energy\nin the case of a high-frequency qubit\nIn this appendix we briefly discuss the modification\nto the oscillator's kinetic energy in the case of a highfrequency qubit (see Sec. III C). One could perform the\ncalculation by considering only the kinetic-energy term,\nwithout considering the specific form of the trapping potential, i.e. by using the completely delocalized momentum eigenstates as a basis for the calculation. Such a\ncalculation, however, turns out not to lead to simple,\ntransparent results. We therefore consider the corrections that one would need to add to the kinetic-energy\nterm in the effective oscillator Hamiltonian starting from\nthe eigenstates of the free-oscillator Hamiltonian.\nThe eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124ho can be expressed in the position basis as\nZ\n|ki = dx\u03c8k (x) |xi .\n(46)\n\n\f18\nTaking into account the high-frequency, adiabatically adjusting qubit, and for definiteness taking the case of the\nqubit's ground state, the above eigenstates are modified\nas follows:\nZ\nE\nk\u0303 =\ndx\u03c8k (x) |xi \u2297 |g(x)i\nZ\nX\n=\ndx\u03c8k (x)\n\u03c8k\u2217\u2032 (x) |k \u2032 i \u2297 |g(x)i , (47)\n\ncorrection to the kinetic-energy term in the Hamiltonian.\nThis factor can be estimated as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6(x1 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x2 )\n\u22121\nhg(x1 )| g(x2 )i \u2212 1 = cos\n2\n[\u03c6(x1 ) \u2212 \u03c6(x2 )]\n\u2248 \u2212\n8\n\u0012\n\u00132\ng(x1 \u2212 x2 )\n\u223c\nEq\n\nk\u2032\n\nwhere |g(x)i has the same meaning as |gx i from Sec. III C.\nOne can now obtain the correction to the kinetic-energy\nterm as:\nZZ\nD p\u03022 E\n2\nX\n \u0303l \u2212 hk| p\u0302 |li =\ndx1 dx2\nk\u0303\n\u03c8k\u2217 (x1 )\u03c8k\u2032 (x1 )\n2m\n2m\n\u2032 \u2032\nk l\n\n\u03c8l\u2217\u2032 (x2 )\u03c8l (x2 ) hk \u2032 |\n\n2\n\np\u0302\n|l\u2032 i (hg(x1 )| g(x2 )i \u2212 1) .(48)\n2m\n\nThe factor between parentheses represents the relative\n\n[1] E.
