The simple structure of these models has made possible a large\nnumber of links to other models and fields and has fascinated researchers ever since the early days of Ising [1]\nand Bethe [2].\nThe XY chain [3, 4] is an especially simple example\nsince it can be mapped to a system of noninteracting\nlattice fermions. Its dynamics are nevertheless nontrivial\nsince single-site spin operators are mapped to strings of\nFermi operators and hence two-spin correlation functions\ncorrespond to many-fermion correlation functions which\nmay become cumbersome to evaluate analytically.\nHowever, numerical calculations have been important\n\nH =\u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n\b \u0002\ny \u0003\nx\nJ (1 + \u03b3)Six Si+1\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b3)Siy Si+1\n+ hSiz ;\n\nwith anisotropy parameter 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1. The limiting\ncases \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 are the isotropic XX and transverse Ising (TI) chains, respectively.

An early example is the numerical calculation\nof Sur et al. [5] for up to nine spins, suggesting a Gaussian behavior of the infinite temperature x autocorrelation of the isotropic XY chain. That numerical evidence\nwas soon corroborated by independent rigorous proofs for\nthe general XY model from two groups [6\u20138]. Here we report numerical results for the long-time and long-distance\nasymptotic behavior of the x spin pair correlation functions of anisotropic XY chains. Analytical results for\nthese correlations were derived for the special case of the\nisotropic model only [9]. Our numerical results indicate\nthat the analytic formulae valid in the isotropic case possess natural extensions into the anisotropic regime.\nThe S = 1/2 XY model [3, 4] is defined by the Hamiltonian\n\n(2)\n\nPi\u22121 \u2020\nPi\u22121 \u2020\nSi+ = (\u22121) k=1 ak ak a\u2020i , Si\u2212 = ai (\u22121) k=1 ak ak , (3)\nbetween the spin-1/2 operators Siz , Si\u00b1 = Six \u00b1 iSiy at\nlattice sites i and the creation and annihilation operators\na\u2020i , ai of lattice fermions maps the spin Hamiltonian (1)\nto a Hamiltonian of noninteracting fermions:\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n1\nJh \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\na ai+1 + ai+1 ai + \u03b3 ai ai+1 + ai+1 ai + h ai ai \u2212\n.\n2 i\n2\n\nNote that for \u03b3 6= 0 the number of fermions is not con-\n\n(1)\n\n(4)\n\nserved. From (2),(3) it is evident that the spin corre-\n\n\f2\nlation functions hSiz (t)Sjz i are essentially fermion density correlation functions, while the correlation functions\nhSix (t)Sjx i are much more complicated when expressed in\nthe fermion representation. The fermionic identity\n\u2020\n\n(\u22121)ak ak = (a\u2020k + ak )(a\u2020k \u2212 ak )\n\n(5)\n\nconverts the string of signs appearing in (3) into an expectation value of 2(i + j \u2212 1) fermion operators, which\nmay be expressed as a Pfaffian [11] by Wick's theorem.\nPfaffians are close relatives of determinants and play a\nrole in several statistical mechanical problems [12]. Their\nnumerical evaluation proceeds along similar lines as that\nof determinants. The numerical calculations of this study\nwere all performed for spin chains with open boundary\nconditions. Periodic boundary conditions, while desirable from an aesthetic point of view, lead to additional\nboundary terms in the fermionic model [3, 4] which make\nnumerical calculations awkward, if not impossible. Of\ncourse, finite-size and boundary effects are a matter of\nconcern in any numerical calculation. They are also a\ntopic of research in their own right and have been studied earlier [11, 13, 14]. In the present study, however,\nwe focus on the asymptotic behavior of bulk spin correlations in the thermodynamic limit. To make sure that\nopen-chain numerical results pertain to that situation,\nonly spins sufficiently far from the boundaries of sufficiently long chains may be considered. We have checked\nthat the numerical results to be presented below are not\nsubject to finite-size or boundary effects during the time\nintervals shown.\nSeveral results about exact and asymptotic properties\nof the dynamic spin correlation functions have been obtained over the years. The asymptotic time dependence\n\nof the longitudinal correlation function hSiz (t)Sjz i is \u223c t\u22121\nfor all i and j in the bulk of the system at all temperatures [15\u201317]. This can be traced back to the properties\nof the one-particle density of states of the Jordan-Wigner\nfermions and the fact that hSiz (t)Sjz i is related to fermion\ndensity correlations. For i and j close to the boundary\nof a long open chain the situation is a little more complicated [13, 14].\nDue to its more complicated structure in the\nfermion representation, the transverse correlation function hSix (t)Sjx i is more sensitive to temperature variations. At infinite temperature it vanishes for i 6= j and\nshows Gaussian decay for i = j [5\u20138]. At zero temperature that correlation function exhibits an asymptotic\npower-law decay in both space and time for the isotropic\n(XX) chain. [18, 19]. For finite temperature and in\nthe isotropic case Its et al [9] showed that the decay\nof hSix (t)Sjx i is asymptotically exponential in both space\nand time; numerical calculations [11] could be used to assess the range of validity of the exponential asymptotics.\nSimilar exponential behavior at finite temperature was\nalso observed in the TI chain [20] and in rather general\none-dimensional gapless integrable models [21]. Asymptotic finite-temperature correlations of the TI chain were\nalso studied in [22, 23]; many interesting results on the\nzero-temperature correlations of that model were recently\nobtained by Perk and Au-Yang [24].\nBefore discussing our numerical results it is useful to\nrecapitulate what is known [25] about the ground state\nof the XY Hamiltonian (1) for general anisotropy \u03b3. Employing a Fourier transform followed by a Bogoljubov\ntransform, H can be brought into diagonal free-fermion\nform with the single-particle spectrum\n\nq\n\u03b5k = \u2212sign(h + J cos k) (h + J cos k)2 + \u03b3 2 J 2 sin2 k;\n\nThe spectrum (for |h| \u2264 |J|) has two branches with negative and positive one-particle\n\u221a energies, respectively, with\na gap of size \u2206\u03b5 = 2|\u03b3| J 2 \u2212 h2 at the critical wave\nvector given by cos kc = \u2212 Jh . The ground state in the\nfermionic picture has all negative-energy states occupied\nand all others empty. The spectral gap closes at the critical field strength |h| = |J| (for arbitrary \u03b3) and for the\nisotropic case \u03b3 = 0 and arbitrary h (the XX chain),\nthe case considered by Its et al [9]. For h 6= 0 the ground\nstate exhibits long-range order along the z axis; the magnetization hSiz i is known analytically [25]. For \u03b3 6= 0 and\n|h| < |J| the ground state also exhibits long-range order\n\n(\u2212\u03c0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u03c0)\n\n(6)\n\nin the xy plane [26] :\nh \u0010\n\u00012 \u0011i 18\n\u03b3 2 1 \u2212 Jh\nx\np\nlim |hSix Si+r\ni| =\n.\nr\u2192\u221e\n2(1 + \u03b3)\n1\n2\n\n(7)\n\nAt finite temperature the equilibrium spin correlation\n\u03b1\nfunctions hSi\u03b1 Si+r\ni were shown to decay exponentially\nwith r for all \u03b1 = x, y, z [26]. For the XX chain, \u03b3 = 0,\nand subcritical fields, |h| < |J|, the finite-temperature\nx\nasymptotics of hSix (t)Si+r\n(0)i were found to be exponential in both space and time [9]. The derivation of that result proceeded by mapping the correlation function to the\nsolution of a classical nonlinear integrable system related\nto the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

In the spacelike region,\nn > v0 t, the correlation is constant and equal to its stationary value. This is due to the fact that the two spins at\ndistance n have not been able to communicate with each\nother yet. Only later can the fermionic quasiparticles of\nk\nenergy \u03b5k transfer any information at group velocity d\u03b5\ndk\nbetween the two spins. For zero magnetic field, h = 0,\nthe maximum velocity v0 turns out [27] to be\nv0 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)J;\n\n(12)\n\nfor nonzero field there is no simple closed expression for\nv0 , but numerical evaluation is simple.\nThe crossover between spacelike and timelike regions\nis illustrated in Fig. 1. In that figure we show a logax\nrithmic plot of |hSix (t)Si+n\ni|2 for n=4, 9, 14, 19 at temperature T /J = 2 and anisotropy \u03b3 = 0.3. We observe\nthat each function is almost perfectly constant up to the\ntime v0 tn = n, where it bends smoothly into exponential decay with weak superimposed oscillations. The decay time does not show any significant dependence on n.\nThe inverse decay time predicted by (8) for the asymptotic regime of the uppermost curve is given by the slope\nof the dot-dashed line and matches our data very well.\nThe linear variation with n of the intercepts at t = 0\nin this logarithmic plot reflects the well-established exponential decay of the equal-time correlation function\nx\nhSix Si+n\ni \u223c exp[\u2212n/\u03be(T )].\nThe inset to Fig. 1 shows again the curve n = 19 of\nthe main plot along with curves for the same correlation\nfunction at different temperatures. Now the crossover\nbetween the space-like and the time-like regime occurs\nroughly at one common value of Jt.

Plotted is the logarithm of\n|hSix (t)Sjx i|2 . The marks on the curves denote the boundary\nbetween space-like and time-like regions, compare (8). The\ninset shows the same function in the same representation, but\nhere the sites are kept fixed (i = 30, j = 49) and the temperature is varied (T /J = 1, 10, 100, top to bottom). The slopes\nof the dot-dashed straight-line segments represent the decay\nrate inferred from the asymptotic expression (8).\n\nwhich reflects the T -dependence of the decay time, while\nthe variable intercept in the space-like regime reflects the\nT -dependence of the correlation length.\nIn Fig. 2 we show results for fixed spatial distance\nn = 14 and fixed temperature T /J = 10, for varying\nanisotropy \u03b3. For growing \u03b3 the decay time in the asymptotic regime grows, as does the crossover time between\nthe space-like and time-like regimes. For \u03b3 \u2192 1 the\ncrossover time diverges since the velocity v0 (12) vanishes. The decay time also diverges as \u03b3 \u2192 1. This is to\nbe expected, since in the absence of a magnetic field the\nmodel at \u03b3 = 1 (i.e. the transverse Ising chain) does not\ndisplay any dynamics. The \u03b3-dependence of the correlation length can be read off from the t = 0 intercepts of\nthe curves shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 3 shows the autocorrelation function (n = 0) over\na longer time interval, demonstrating very clearly how\nwell the conjectured formula (8) fits the numerical results.\nThe temperature dependence of the autocorrelation\nfunction is displayed in Fig. 4 for fixed anisotropy,\n\u03b3 = 0.5. Two regimes can be clearly distinguished: at\nshort times the autocorrelation is a Gaussian, crossing\nover to an exponential behavior at longer times. The\ncrossover time seems to grow roughly logarithmically\nwith temperature, so that at T \u2192 \u221e the well-known\nGaussian behavior [6\u20138] emerges.\nThe dependence of the spin correlation function on the\n\n\f4\n0\nI\n\n-100\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2\n\n-200\n\nx\n\nx\n\nln | <Si (t)Si >|\n\nln|<S\n\nx\nx\n2\n(t)S 49>|\n35\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-150\n\n-400\n\n-600\n-200\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n0\n\nJt\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nJt\n\nFIG. 2: Same as Fig. 1, for fixed distance n = 14 between the\ntwo spins, and fixed temperature, T /J = 10, at h = 0.
