We observed the HI line with the NRAO VLA and\nthe CO(1\u21920) transition with the OVRO millimeter interferometer at\n5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 6\u2032\u2032 angular resolution (750 pc linear resolution). These datacubes offer the required spatial and velocity resolution to determine whether the\nmass concentration near the tip of the tail is a genuine feature, and hence\na good TDG candidate, or an artefact caused by a fortuitous alignment\nof our line of sight with the direction of the tail. A preliminary analysis\nseems to confirm that Arp 245N is a self\u2013gravitating entity.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) are objects resembling actively star forming dwarf\ngalaxies and are assembled from the debris (tidal tails and bridges) launched\ninto the IGM by violent galaxy interactions in which at least one member is\na gas\u2013rich galaxy. They are composed of stars and gas from the outskirts of\none or both of the parent galaxies involved in the interaction. The recent surge\nof interest in TDGs started with papers by Mirabel, Lutz, & Maza (1991) on\nthe Superantennae and Mirabel, Dottori, & Lutz (1992) on the Antennae (see\nalso the review by Duc & Mirabel 1999). Several groups of authors have since\nembarked on the exciting topic of TDGs as witnessed by these proceedings (see\ne.g., the contributions by Duc et al. and by Braine et al. this volume).\nCurrently outstanding questions are: (i) Are TDGs really recycled objects\nmade of collisional debris or pre-existing galaxies involved in a three\u2013body interaction? (ii) Are TDG genuine density enhancements in the tidal tails or are they\nmerely due to projection effects along the line of sight? (iii) Do TDGs form self\ngravitating entities or are they simple transient condensations? (iv) Are TDGs\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBrinks, Duc & Walter\n\nDark Matter (DM) dominated, like galaxies in general, and dwarf galaxies in\nparticular, or are they nearly devoid of DM, as theory predicts? (v) Finally\ndo TDGs leave the potential well of their progenitors and hence constitute a\nsizeable fraction of the known dwarf galaxy population or do they eventually\nfall back and merge, leaving no trace?\nAll these questions have actually been raised for the particular TDG candidate identified in the northern tidal tail of Arp 245, an interacting system\ncomposed of two spiral galaxies, NGC 2992 and NGC 2993. Although Arp 245N\nwas observed at many wavelengths and is one of the best studied TDG candidates, its nature as a tidal object or as a real entity have been challenged.\nSmith & Struck (2001) argued that TDG Arp 245N could actually be a preexisting edge-on disk galaxy that is interacting with the other two galaxies. Hibbard\net al. (this volume) point out that this system is viewed from an unfavorable\nperspective, making the projection effects particularly severe.\nThe combination of high\u2013resolution kinematical and morphological data is\ncritical to tackle all these issues. We have therefore carried out HI and CO\ninterferometric observations of the system.\n2.\n\nThe Interacting System Arp 245 (= NGC 2992/3)\n\nNGC 2992/3 is a relatively nearby system, at an adopted distance of 31 Mpc\n(Vsys = 2311 km s\u22121 ). Its prominent northern tidal tail hosts a tidal dwarf\ngalaxy candidate which because of its proximity can be studied in detail (Fig. 1).\nThe system was observed by us in HI with the NRAO1 Very Large Array (VLA)\nat an intermediate angular resolution of 19\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 14\u2032\u2032 (Duc et al. 2000).\nToward NGC 2992, the HI shows a peak at the location of the tidal dwarf\ncandidate located at the tip of the tidal tail emanating from NGC 2992. HI is\nseen in absorption against the radio continuum from the nucleus. NGC 2992 is\nclassified as a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy and in the light of H\u03b1 a biconical structure can\nbe seen which extends out into the halo. Toward NGC 2993, the HI map has\na ringlike structure which in its western extension has no optical counterpart.\nWithin NGC 2993 and Arp 245N, HII regions are concentrated within HI clumps\nand trace star\u2013forming regions. Numerical simulations of the NGC 2992/3 collision indicate that we see the system \u223c 100 Myr after closest approach (Duc et\nal. 2000).\nAs reported by Braine et al. (2000, 2001), Arp 245 was detected with the\nIRAM 30\u2013m dish in both the CO(1\u21920) and the CO(2\u21921) transitions. The\nobservations also revealed that the CO emission is extended along the TDG.\nThe H2 mass, assuming the standard (Galactic) CO to H2 conversion factor of\nNH2 /ICO = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 /K km s\u22121 is \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 .\nAn oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=8.6 was measured in the HII regions\nof the TDG candidate. This high metallicity excludes the hypothesis that the\nTDG is in fact a preexisting dwarf galaxy. It is also unlikely that a more massive\ngalaxy was directly involved in the interaction. Indeed, the morphology of the\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation\noperated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\fHI and CO Interferometry of TDGs\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft: Optical R-band image of NGC 2992 with overlaid HI\ncontours from the high resolution VLA B\u2013array observations.

Data calibration and reduction followed standard procedures using the\nClassic AIPS data reduction package. The final data products have a resolution\nof 6\u2032\u2032 (at 5 km s\u22121 velocity resolution) and reach an rms noise of 0.5 mJy beam\u22121\nper channel.\n3.2.\n\nCO Observations\n\nWe observed the tidal dwarf near NGC 2992 in the CO(1\u21920) transition using\nthe Owen's Valley Radio Observatory's mm array (OVRO) in the E, C and\nL configurations for a total of 9 tracks from October 2001 through May 2002.\n\n\f4\n\nBrinks, Duc & Walter\n\nFigure 2.\nPosition\u2013velocity diagram taken through the high resolution HI data along a band connecting NGC 2992 and Arp 245N, along\nthe northern tidal tail.\nThe equatorial E configuration was needed to improve the beam shape for this\n\u03b4 = \u221214\u25e6 source. About 40 hours were spent on source. Data were recorded\nusing a correlator setup resulting in velocity resolutions of 5 km s\u22121 (after online\nHanning smoothing) with a total bandwidth of 320 km s\u22121 . A datacube was\nproduced using the miriad software package which was cleaned to a level of\nabout twice the rms noise (noise: 16 mJy beam\u22121 in a 5 km s\u22121 wide channel).\nThe final beam size is 7.2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4.0\u2032\u2032 .\n4.\n\nResults\n\nFigure 1 shows an integrated HI map of the B\u2013array VLA data only. It should\nbe noted that an interferometer acts as a spatial filter and that the B\u2013array is\nsensitive to structures with typical sizes of between 5\u2032\u2032 and 120\u2032\u2032 . As a result, applying a clean algorithm can leave some low level striping which will disappear\nonce the new data are incorporated with the intermediate resolution maps.\nThe right panel in Figure 1 shows as contours overlaid on the HI map, the\nCO and H\u03b1 emission. CO is clearly detected in the OVRO observations and is\nfound to be resolved. The total integrated flux is \u223c3 Jy km s\u22121 (\u223c 10 K km s\u22121 ),\ncorresponding to a total molecular gas mass, assuming a standard conversion\nfactor of NH2 /ICO = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 /K km s\u22121 , of MH2 \u223c 3.5 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . This is\nabout 25% of the single dish flux which implies that most of the molecular gas\nis distributed smoothly across the region.\n5.\n\nDiscussion and Summary\n\nArp 245N is a typical TDG candidate in the sense that it is a major HI concentration associated with recent star formation which resides near the tip of\nthe tidal tail. Because the latter is seen close to edge\u2013on, the question thus\narises whether the apparent concentration is a genuine feature (Hibbard & Mi-\n\n\fHI and CO Interferometry of TDGs\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.\nPosition\u2013velocity diagram taken through the high resolution HI data along a cross\u2013cut through the TDG Arp 245N and perpendicular to the tidal tail. Angular distances along the cross\u2013cut are\nin arcmin. The faint vertical stripe is an artefact (see text).\nhos, this volume). Bournaud et al. (2003, 2004; see also the contributions by\nAmram et al., this volume) have run extensive numerical models and shown the\ncharacteristic shape in position\u2013velocity space of a bona fide TDG and that of a\nspurious feature. They show that the kinematical signature of projection effects\nis a change in the sign of the velocity gradient along the tail before reaching its\napparent tip. For curved tails that are extended enough in 3D space, a loop-like\nfeature may even be seen in a position\u2013velocity (pV) diagram along the tails.\nFigure 2 shows such a pV diagram along the tidal tail connecting the TDG\ncandidate and NGC 2992 using the intermediate and high resolution VLA HI\ndata. The signal was actually integrated over a band with a width similar to\nthat of the tail. The loop expected for projection effects is clearly seen on the\nfigure. The part of the tail that is seen curving back towards NGC 2992 (as seen\nprojected on the sky) is actually consistent with our earlier numerical simulations\nof the system (Duc et al., 2000; see the face\u2013on view in their Fig. 10).\nThe HI morphology of the tidal tail, as seen at high resolution in Fig. 1,\nmay also give some clues as to the geometry of the system. Its U\u2013like shape\ncould be interpreted as being due to bending of the tidal tail near its apparent\ntip. The tail is actually not seen perfectly edge\u2013on (as indicated, in the optical,\nby the large width of the stellar tail). Thanks to the higher spatial resolution\nprovided by the VLA in its B\u2013configuration, we can hence 'resolve' the projection\neffects \u2013 which was impossible with the early C\u2013array data. On this map, the\nHI column density seems to peak in the part of the tail which points back to\nNGC 2992. This is where OVRO detected the bulk of the molecular gas and\nwhere the brightest HII regions in the tail are found. The velocities of all these\nphases match. The spatial and velocity coincidence between the CO, H\u03b1 and HI\nemission peaks at this location in the tail is a strong indication that a genuine\n\n\f6\n\nBrinks, Duc & Walter\n\ncondensation is present there and that this is likely the progenitor of a Tidal\nDwarf galaxy.\nAt the same position, a pV diagram perpendicular to the tidal tail shows\na small scale velocity gradient similar to that expected for a rotating body (see\nFig. 3). The peak\u2013to\u2013peak velocity range is 100 km s\u22121 . A word of caution is\nwarranted here, though. As Duc et al. (2000) mentioned, the simulated pV diagram along the same direction in the numerical model shows a similar gradient.\nFurther simulations are required to disentangle the embedded TDG from the\nrest of the tail. We should then be able to determine its dynamical mass and,\ncomparing it with the luminous mass (corresponding to the HI condensation\nin the B\u2013array), probe its dark matter content. Not taking into account the\nline of sight crowding, and considering all the matter present at the apparent\ntip of the tail, one derives a dynamical mass similar to the luminous one and\nequal to \u223c 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . For the above-mentioned reasons, these are most likely\noverestimates.\nIn summary, a first analysis of new high resolution HI and CO datacubes\ntends to support the existence of a bound entity within the northern tail of\nArp 245. However, they also show the kinematical signature expected when part\nof the tail is bending away along the line of sight, and eventually back to NGC\n2992. Because of these projection effects, the size and mass of the embedded\nTDG candidate derived from low resolution data are probably overestimates.\nAcknowledgments.
