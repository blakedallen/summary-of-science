T is geometric if it is pregeometric and eliminates\nthe quantifiers \u2203\u221e . We call a structure K (pre)geometric if its theory is\n(pre)geometric (thus, K is pregeometric iff there exists an \u03c9-saturated elementary extension K\u2032 of K such that acl satisfies EP in K\u2032 ).\nNote that a pregeometric expansion of a field is geometric ([DMS08, 1.18],\nsee also Lemma 3.46).\nIn the remainder of this introduction, all theories and all structures expand a field; in the body of the article we will sometimes state definitions\nand results without this assumption.\nGeometric structures are ubiquitous in model theory: if K is either ominimal, or strongly minimal, or a p-adic field, or a pseudo-finite field (or\nmore generally a perfect PAC field, see [CDM92] and [HP94, 2.12]), then K\nis geometric.\nHowever, ultraproducts of geometric structures (even strongly minimal\nones) are not geometric in general. We will show that there is a more general\nnotion, structures with existential matroids, which instead is robust under\ntaking ultraproducts. More in details, we consider structures K with a matroid cl that satisfies some natural conditions (cl is an \"existential matroid\").\n2\n\n\fA. Fornasiero\n\nDimensions, matroids, and dense pairs. V. 2.8\n\nUnder our hypothesis that K is a field, then there is at most one existential\nmatroid on K. An (almost) equivalent notion has already been studied by\nvan den Dries [Dries89]: we will show that, if M is a monster model, an existential matroid on M induces a (unique) dimension function on the definable\nsubset of Mn , satisfying the axioms in [Dries89], and conversely, any such\ndimension function, satisfying a slightly stronger version of the axioms, will\nbe induced by a (unique) existential matroid. Moreover, a superstable group\nK of U-rank a power of \u03c9 is naturally endowed by an existential matroid\n(van den Dries [Dries89, 2.25] noticed this already in the case when K is a\ndifferential field of characteristic 0).\nGiven a geometric structure K, there is an abstract notion of dense subsets\nof K, which specialises to the usual topological notion in the case of o-minimal\nstructures or of formally p-adic fields. More precisely, a subset X of K is dense\nin K if every infinite K-definable subset of K intersect X [Macintyre75]. If\nT is a complete geometric theory, then the theory of dense elementary pairs\nof models of T is complete and consistent (the proof of this fact was already\nin [Dries98], but the result was stated there only for o-minimal structures).\nWe consider here the more general case when T is a complete theory and\nsuch that a monster model of T has an existential matroid. We show that\nthere is a corresponding abstract notion of density in models of T . Given\nT as above, consider the theory of pairs hK, K\u2032 i, where K \u227a K\u2032 |= T and\nK is dense in K\u2032 ; the theory of such pairs will not be complete in general,\nbut we will show that it will become complete (and consistent) if we add the\nadditional condition that K is cl-closed in K\u2032 (that is, cl(K) \u2229 K\u2032 = K); we\nthus obtain the (complete) theory T d . Moreover T d also has an existential\nmatroid. This allows us to iterate the above construction, and consider dense\ncl-closed pairs of models of T d , which turn out to coincide with nested dense\ncl-closed triples of models of T ; iterating many times, we can thus study\nnested dense cl-closed n-tuples of models of T .\nOf particular interest are two cases of structures with an existential matroid: the cl-minimal case and the d-minimal one.\nA structure K (with an existential matroid) is cl-minimal if there is only\none \"generic\" 1-type over every subset of K; the prototypes of such structures\nare given by strongly minimal structures and connected superstable groups\nof U-rank a power of \u03c9. If T is the theory of K, we show that the condition\nthat K is dense in K\u2032 is superfluous in the definition of T d , and that T d is\nalso cl-minimal.\nAn first-order topological structure K (expanding a topological field) is\nd-minimal if it is Hausdorff, it has an \u03c9-saturated elementary extension K\u2032\nsuch that every definable (unary!) subset of K\u2032 is the union of an open set and\nfinitely many discrete sets, and it satisfies a version of Kuratowski-Ulam's\n3\n\n\f3. Matroids\ntheorem for definable subset of K2 (the \"d\" stands for \"discrete\"). Examples of\nd-minimal structures are p-adic fields, o-minimal structures, and d-minimal\nstructures in the sense of Miller. We show that a d-minimal structure has\na (unique) existential matroid, and that the notion of density given by the\nmatroid coincides with the topological one. Moreover, if T is the theory\nof a d-minimal structure, then T d is the theory of dense elementary pairs\nof models of T (the condition that K is a cl-closed subset of K\u2032 is superfluous); hence, in the case when T is o-minimal, we recover van den Dries'\nTheorem [Dries98]. However, if T is d-minimal, T d will not be d-minimal.\nMoreover, while ultraproducts of o-minimal structures and of formally p-adic\nfields are d-minimal, ultraproducts of d-minimal structures are not d-minimal\nin general.\nWe show that if K has an existential matroid, then K is a perfect field:\ntherefore, the theory exposed in this article does not apply to differential\nfields of finite characteristic, or to separably closed non-perfect fields.\n\n2\n\nNotations and conventions\n\nLet T be a complete theory in some language L, with only infinite models.\nLet \u03ba > |T | be a \"big\" cardinal.

If M expands a field, then M must be a perfect field. In\nparticular, the theory of separably closed and non-algebraically closed fields,\nand the theory of differentially closed fields of finite characteristic do not\nadmit an existential matroid.\nProof. Cf. [Dries89, 1.6]. If M is not perfect, then Mp is a proper definable\nsubfield of M, where p := char(M), and therefore dimcl (Mp ) = 0.

If a and B are real, then a \u2208 cleq (B) iff a \u2208 cl(B).\nRemark 6.3. If a is real a B is imaginary, then a \u2208 cleq (B) iff rkcl (\u039e(a/B)) <\n\u03ba.\nProof. Assume that rkcl (\u039e(a/B)) \u2265 \u05d00 ; we want to show that rkcl (\u039e(a/B)) \u2265\n\u03ba. For every \u03bb < \u03ba, consider the type in \u03bb variables p(x\u0304) over B, saying that,\nfor every i < \u03bb, xi \u2261B a, and the xi are cl-independent. By assumption, p(x\u0304)\nis consistent, and hence satisfied in M by \u03bb-tuple (ai )i<\u03bb ; thus, the ai are\n\u03bb-independent elements in \u039e(a/B). Therefore, rkcl (\u039e(a/B)) > \u03bb for every\n\u03bb < \u03ba; since \u03ba is a limit cardinal, we are done.\nRecall that M has geometric elimination of imaginaries if every for imaginary tuple \u0101 there exists a real tuple b\u0304 such that \u0101 and b\u0304 are inter-algebraic.\nIf M had geometric elimination of imaginaries, we could define \u0101 \u2208 cleq (B)\niff there exists a real tuple c\u0304 such that \u0101 \u2208 acleq (c\u0304) and c\u0304 \u2282 cleq (B). In\nthe general case, we need a more involved definition and some preliminary\nlemmata.\nLemma 6.4 (Exchange Principle [Gagelman05, 3.1]). cleq satisfies the Exchange Principle for real points over imaginary parameters. That is, for\na and b real elements and C imaginary, if a \u2208 cleq (bC) \\ cleq (C), then\nb \u2208 cleq (aC).\n25\n\n\f6. Extension to imaginary elements\nProof. Let a, b, and C as in the hypothesis, and assume, for contradiction,\nthat b \u2208\n/ cleq (aC). Let B be a real set (of cardinality less than \u03ba), such that\n\u039e(a/bC) \u2286 cl(B). By enlarging B, w.l.o.g. we can assume that C \u2286 dcleq (B).\nSince a \u2208\n/ cleq (C), \u039e(a/C) * cl(B), and therefore there exists \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(M/C)\nsuch that a\u2032 := a\u03c3 \u2208\n/ cl(B). Since b \u2208\n/ cleq (aC), we have b\u03c3 \u2208\n/ cleq (a\u2032 C), and\n\u2032\n\u03c3\n\u2032\n\u2032\ntherefore there exists b \u2261a\u2032 C b such that b \u2208\n/ cl(a B).\n\u2032 \u2032\nNotice that a b \u2261C ab; let \u03bc \u2208 Aut(M/C) such that a\u2032 = a\u03bc and b\u2032 = b\u03bc ,\nand define B \u2032 := B \u03bc . Since \u039e(a/bC) \u2286 cl(B), we have \u039e(a\u2032 /b\u2032 C) \u2286 cl(B \u2032 ).\nMoreover, since C \u2286 dcleq (B \u2032 ), we have \u039e(a\u2032 /b\u2032 B \u2032 ) \u2286 \u039e(a\u2032 /b\u2032 C) \u2286 cl(B \u2032 ).\nThus, a\u2032 \u2208 cl(b\u2032 B) \\ cl(B); hence, since a\u2032 , b\u2032 , and B are real, b\u2032 \u2208 cl(a\u2032 B),\nabsurd.\nIt is relatively easy to also prove the following:\nLemma 6.5 (Transitivity). cleq is transitive for real sets over imaginary\nparameters: that is, if A is a imaginary,b\u0304 is a tuple of reals, and c is real,\nsuch that b\u0304 \u2286 cleq (A) and c \u2208 cleq (Ab\u0304), then c \u2208 cleq (A).\ndef:rank\n\nDefinition 6.6.

Moreover, rkcl (\u0101/A) is a natural number, and coincides with\nthe one given in Corollary 6.7 when \u0101 is real. Finally, rkcl is a rank function\non Meq .\nProof. Let's prove that rkcl does no depend on the choice of b\u0304. Let b\u0304 and b\u0304\u2032\nbe real tuples, such t hat \u0101 \u2286 acleq (Ab\u0304) and \u0101 \u2286 acleq (Ab\u0304\u2032 ). W.l.o.g., b\u0304 \u2286 b\u0304\u2032\nand hence b\u0304\u2032 = hb\u0304, b\u0304\u2032\u2032 i. We must prove that rkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /A) \u2212 rkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /\u0101A) =\nrkcl (b\u0304/A) \u2212 rkcl (b\u0304/\u0101A). The above is equivalent to rkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /A) \u2212 rkcl (b\u0304/A) =\nrkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /\u0101A) \u2212 rkcl (b\u0304/\u0101A). But the left hand side is equal to rkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /b\u0304A),\nwhile the right hand side is equal to rkcl (b\u0304b\u0304\u2032\u2032 /\u0101b\u0304A). Since \u0101 \u2208 acleq (b\u0304A), the\ntwo sides are equal.\nLet's prove additivity. Let \u0101 and \u0101\u2032 be imaginary tuples and C be a set\nof imaginary elements. We want to prove that rkcl (\u0101\u0101\u2032 /C) = rkcl (\u0101/\u0101\u2032 C) +\nrkcl (\u0101\u2032 /C).

Consider the following\npartial L-type over b\u0304a:\nq(x) := (x \u22611b\u0304 a) & (x \u2323\n| a).\nb\u0304\n\nSince \u2323\n| satisfies Existence, q is consistent. Let d \u2208 B be any realisation of q.\nSince d \u2323\n| b\u0304 a, we conclude that either d \u2208\n/ cl(b\u0304a) or d \u2208 cl(b\u0304). However, the\n1\nlatter cannot happen, since d \u2261b\u0304 a \u2208\n/ cl(b\u0304); thus, d \u2208\n/ cl(b\u0304a), and therefore\ndim(q) = 1. Hence, since A is dense in B and hB, Ai is \u03c9-saturated, there\nexists a\u2032 \u2208 A satisfying q. Reasoning in the same way, we can show that\nthere exists (a2 , a3 , a4 , . . . ) a Morley sequence in q contained in A. By Corollary 8.19, ai \u22612b\u0304 a for every i. Let c1 , c2 , . . . , cm be all the L2 -conjugates of\nc over b\u0304 (there are finitely many of them), and let \u03c6(x, y, z\u0304) be an x-narrow\nL-formula without parameters such that B |= \u03c6(c, a, b\u0304). W\nThe L-formula (in y, with parameters in b\u0304c1 , . . . , cm ) i \u03c6(ci , y, b\u0304) is equivalent to an L2 -formula in y with parameters b\u0304; hence, every ai satisfies it\n(because ai \u22612b\u0304 a). Hence, w.l.o.g. c1 \u2208 cl(b\u0304a2 ) \u2229 cl(b\u0304a3 ) = cl(b\u0304) (because\na2 \u2323\n| b\u0304 a3 ). Therefore, c \u2208 cl(b\u0304).\nIt remains to show that c \u2208 acl1 (b\u0304). Let c2 \u2208 Beq such that c2 \u22611b\u0304 c. Since\nB is \u03c9-saturated, it suffices to prove that there are only finitely many such c2 .\nSince c \u2208 acl2 (b\u0304), it suffices to prove that c2 \u22612b\u0304 c. Let b\u03041 := b\u0304c, b\u03042 := b\u0304c2 ,\nand \u0101 := b\u0304 \u2229 A. By assumption, b\u03041 \u22611 b\u03042 . By Claim 6, we have b\u03041 \u2286 cl(b\u0304),\nand therefore, since b\u0304 \u2323\n| \u0101 A, b\u03041 is P -independent. Claim 6 also implies that\nb\u03042 \u2286 cl(b\u0304), and hence b\u03042 is also P -independent. It remains to show that b\u03041\nand b\u03042 have the same P -type. Assume e.g. that c \u2208 A. Since b\u0304 \u2323\n| \u0101 A, we\nB\nhave that c \u2208 cl(\u0101), and therefore c2 \u2208 cl (\u0101) \u2286 A.\nThe other assertions are proved in the same way.\n37\n\n\f8.

Notice that rk(B\u2217 /A\u2217 ) \u2265 \u03ba.\nDefinition 8.26. For every X \u2286 B\u2217 we define the small closure of X as\nScl(X) := cl(XA\u2217 ).\nFor lovely pairs (e.g., dense pairs of o-minimal structures), the small\nclosure was already defined in [Berenstein07].\nRemark 8.27. Scl is a definable matroid (on M\u2217 ).\nProof. Scl coincides with the operator clA\u2217 in Lemma 5.5.\nNotice that we can apply Lemma 5.6: SclB = (clB )A : we can \"compute\"\nthe small closure of a subset of B inside B using A instead of A\u2217 .\nWe want to prove that Scl is existential; we will need a preliminary lemma.\nLemma 8.28. Let b \u2208 B\u2217 \\ A\u2217 . Define M\u2217b the expansion of M\u2217 with a constant for b, and Sclb (X) := Scl(bX) = cl(XA\u2217 b). Then, Sclb is an existential\nmatroid on M\u2217b .\nProof. That Sclb is a definable matroid follows from Lemma 5.5, applied\nto Scl. Let X \u2286 M\u2217 , and Y := Sclb (X).\nClaim 7. Y \u227a M\u2217 (as an L2 -structure).\nBy Lemma 7.4, Y is an elementary L-substructure of B\u2217 . By Theorems 8.3, and 8.5 and, again, Lemma 7.4, it suffices to show that A\u2217 is a\ncl-closed, dense, and proper subset of Y , which is trivially true.\nThe lemma then follows from the above claim and Lemma 3.22; nontriviality follows from the fact that Zrk(B\u2217 /A\u2217 ) \u2265 \u03ba.\nlem:scl\n\nLemma 8.29. Scl is an existential matroid.\nProof. The only thing that needs proving is Existence. Define \u039e2 (a/C) as\nthe set of conjugates of a over C in M. Assume that \u039e2 (a/C) \u2286 Scl(CD). We\nwant to prove that a \u2208 Scl(C). Choose b, b\u2032 \u2208 B\u2217 which are cl-independent\nover A\u2217 C. By applying the previous lemma to Sclb and Sclb\u2032 , we see that\na \u2208 Sclb (C) \u2229 Sclb\u2032 (C) = cl(A\u2217 Cb) \u2229 cl(A\u2217 Cb\u2032 ) = cl(A\u2217 C) = Scl(C).\nHence, we can define the dimension induced by Scl, and denote it by Sdim.\nNotice that, by Theorem 3.47, Scl is the only existential matroid on T d .\n38\n\n\fA.

From cl \u2286 Scl follows immediately that Sdim(X) \u2264 dim(X). For\nthe opposite inequality, we proceed by induction on k := dim(X). Assume,\nfor contradiction, that Sdim(X) < k. W.l.o.g., dim(\u03a0nk (X)) = k; therefore,\nw.l.o.g. k = n. If k = 1, then Sdim(X) = 0, and therefore F 4 (X) 6= B\u2217 n ,\ncontradicting dim(X) = 1. For the inductive step, assume k = n > 1, and\nlet U := {a \u2208 Bn : dim(Xa ) = n \u2212 1}. U is definable in B, and therefore, by\ninductive hypothesis, Sdim(U) = dim(U) = n \u2212 1. By the case k = 1, for\nevery a \u2208 Kn\u22121 , dim(Xa ) = Sdim(X), and therefore Sdim(Xa ) = 1 for every\na \u2208 U. Thus, Sdim(X) = n.\nDefinition 8.31. Let X \u2286 (B\u2217 )n be definable in hB\u2217 , A\u2217 i. We say that X is\nsmall if Sdim(X) = 0. Let Y \u2286 Bn be definable in hB, Ai. We say that Y is\nsmall if Sdim(Y \u2217 ) = 0, where Y \u2217 is the interpretation of Y inside hB\u2217 , A\u2217 i.\nNotice that, if X \u2282 Bn is A-small (in the sense of Definition 8.6), then X\nis also small in the above sense.

We will show that for\nd-minimal structure the topology induces a canonical existential matroid,\nwhich we denote by Zcl. Moreover, the abstract notion of density introduced\nin \u00a77 coincides with the usual topological notion. Finally, if T is a complete\nd-minimal theory expanding the theory of fields, then in T d the condition\nthat the smaller structure is cl-closed is superfluous. Our definition of dminimality extends an older definition by C. Miller [Miller05], that applied\nonly to linearly ordered structures.\nLet K be a first-order topological structure in the sense of [Pillay87]. That\nis, K is a structure with a topology, such that a basis of the topology is given\nby {\u03a6(K, \u0101) : \u0101 \u2208 Km } for a certain formula without parameters \u03a6(x, \u0233); fix\nsuch a formula \u03a6(x, \u0233), and denote B\u0101 := \u03a6(K, \u0101). Examples of topological\nstructures are valued fields, or ordered structures. On Kn we put the product\ntopology.7 Let M \u0017 K be a monster model.

By assumption, w.l.o.g. \u03a021 (Z) is discrete and, for every x \u2208 K, Zx is\nalso discrete. Therefore, Z is discrete, and hence \u03b8(Z) has empty interior.\nDefinition 9.3.

A structure K is definably complete if it expands a linear\norder hK, <i, and every K-definable subset of K has a supremum in K \u2294\n{\u00b1\u221e}. C.

In particular, o-minimal structures and ultra-products of ominimal structures are d-minimal in Miller's sense. If K expands a field and\nis a d-minimal structures in the sense of Miller, then K is d-minimal in our\nsense (the proof will be given elsewhere).

Assume that T is cl-minimal. Then, T d is also cl-minimal.\nMoreover, T d coincides with T 2 .\nProof. Let hB\u2217 , A\u2217 i be a monster model of T d . Let C \u2282 B\u2217 with |C| < \u03ba.\nDefine A := cl(A\u2217 C), and qC (x) the partial L2 -type over C given by\nqC (x) := x \u2208\n/ A.\nIt is clear that every generic 1-T d-type over C expands qC . Hence, it suffices\nto prove that qC is complete. Let b and b\u2032 \u2208 B\u2217 satisfy qC . By Corollary 8.18,\nhB\u2217 , A\u2217 i \u0016 hB\u2217 , Ai. By assumption, b and b\u2032 are not in A; hence, since T is\ncl-minimal, they satisfy the same generic 1-T -type pA ; thus, by Corollary 8.20,\nb \u22612A b\u2032 .\n\n11\n\nConnected groups\n\nLet M be a monster model, and cl be an existential matroid on it.

We say that X is connected if, for every Y definable\nsubset of X, either dim(Y ) < n, or dim(X \\ Y ) < n.\nFor instance, if M is cl-minimal and X = M, then X is connected.\nRemark 11.2. If X is connected, then, for every l \u2265 0, X l is also connected.\nRemark 11.3. Let X \u2286 Mn be definable, of dimension m > 0. Then, X\nis connected iff for every A \u2282 M containing the parameters of definition\nof X, there exists exactly one n-type over A in X which is generic (i.e., of\ndimension m).\nlem:semigroup\n\nLemma 11.4. Let G \u2286 Mn be definable and connected. Assume that G is\na semigroup with left cancellation. Assume moreover that G has either right\ncancellation or right identity. Then G is a group.\nCf. [Poizat87, 1.1].\nProof. Assume not. Let m := dim(G). W.l.o.g., G is definable without\nparameters. For every a \u2208 G, let a * G := {a * x : a \u2208 G}. Since G has left\ncancellation, we have dim(a * M) = m.\nLet F := {a \u2208 G : a * G = G}. Our aim is to prove that F = G.\nIt is easy to see that G is multiplicatively closed.\nFirst, assume that G has a right identity element 1. The following claim\nis true for any abstract semigroup with left cancellation and right identity 1.\n50\n\n\fA. Fornasiero\n\nDimensions, matroids, and dense pairs. V. 2.8\n\nClaim 16. 1 is also the left identity.\nIn fact, for every a, b \u2208 G, a * b = (a * 1) * b = a * (1 * b). Since we have left\ncancellation, we conclude that b = 1 * b for every b, and we are done.\nObviously, 1 \u2208 F . For every a \u2208 F , denote by a\u22121 the (unique) element\nof G such that a * a\u22121 = 1.\nClaim 17. a\u22121 * a = 1.\nIn fact, a * (a\u22121 * a) = 1 * a = a * 1, and the claim follows from left\ncancellation.\nClaim 18. F is a group.\nWe have already seen that F is multiplicatively closed and 1 \u2208 F . Let\na \u2208 F . Then, for every g \u2208 G, a\u22121 * (a * g) = g, and therefore a\u22121 \u2208 F .\nClaim 19. dim(F ) < m.\nAssume, for contradiction, that dim(F ) = m. Let a \u2208 G \\ F . Then,\nF \u2229 (a * F ) 6= \u2205; let u, v \u2208 F such that u = a * v.\nSince u \u2208 F and F is a group, there exists w \u2208 F such that v * w = 1;\nhence, u * w = a * 1 = a, and therefore a \u2208 F , absurd.\nChoose a, b \u2208 G independent (over the empty set). Since dim(a * G) =\ndim(b * G) = m, we have a \u2208 b * G and b \u2208 a * G. Let u, v \u2208 G such that\nb = a * u and a = b * v. Hence, a = a * u * v.\nSince a * 1 = a * u * v, we have 1 = u * v. Hence, both u and v are in F .\nHowever, since dim(F ) < m and b = a * u, we have rk(b/a) \u2264 rk(u) < m,\nabsurd.\nIf instead G has right cancellation, it suffices, by symmetry, to show that\nG has a left identity. Reasoning as above, we can show that there exists a\nand b in G such that a * b = a. We claim that b is a left identity. In fact,\nfor every c \u2208 G, we have a * b * c = a * c, and therefore b * c = c, and we are\ndone.\nProviso. For the remainder of this section, hG, *i is a definable connected\ngroup, of dimension m > 0, with identity 1.\nIf G is Abelian, we will also use + instead of * and 0 instead of 1.\nHence, if G expands a ring without zero divisors, then, by applying the\nabove lemma to the multiplicative semigroup of G, we obtain that G is a\ndivision ring.\nRemark 11.5. Let X \u2286 G be definable, such that X * X \u2286 X. Then,\ndim(X) = m iff X = G.\nProof. Assume that dim(X) = m. Let a \u2208 G. Then, X \u2229 (a * X \u22121 ) 6= \u2205;\nchoose u, v \u2208 X such that u = a * v \u22121 . Hence, a = u * v \u2208 X * X = X.\n51\n\n\f11. Connected groups\n\nlem:homo\n\nLemma 11.6. Let f : G \u2192 G be a definable homomorphism. If dim(ker f ) =\n0, then f is surjective.\nCf. [Poizat87, 1.7].\nProof. Let H := f (G) and K := ker(f ); notice that H < G and K < G.\nMoreover, by additivity of dimension, m = dim(H) + dim(K). Hence, if\ndim(K) = 0, then dim(H) = m, therefore H = G and f is surjective.\nExample 11.7. hZ, +i cannot be cl-minimal, because the homomorphism\nx 7\u2192 2x has trivial kernel but is not surjective.\n\nlem:quotient\n\nLemma 11.8. Let H < G be definable, with dim(H) = k < m. Then, G/H\nis connected, and dim(G/H) = m \u2212 k.\nProof. That dim(G/H) = m \u2212 k is obvious. Let X \u2286 G/H be definable of\ndimension m\u2212k. We must prove that dim(G/H \\X) < m. Let \u03c0 : G \u2192 G/H\nbe the canonical projection, and Y := \u03c0 \u22121 (X). Then, dim(Y ) = m, and\ntherefore dim(G \\ Y ) < m. Thus, dim(G/H \\ X) = dim(\u03c0(Y )) < m \u2212 k.\nConjecture 11.9. If m = 1, then G is Abelian. Cf. Reineke's Theorem\n[Poizat87, 3.10].\n\ncl:conjugate\n\ncl:conjugate-2\n\nIdea for proof. Assume for contradiction that G is not Abelian. Let Z :=\nZ(G) and G := G/Z. Since Z < G and Z 6= G, we have dim(Z) = 0, and\ntherefore G is also connected and of dimension 1.\nFor every a \u2208 G, let Ua be the set of conjugates of a.\nClaim 20. If a \u2208\n/ Z, then dim(Ua ) = 1.\nBy general group theory, Ua \u2261 G/C(a), where C(a) is the centraliser\nof a. Since a \u2208\n/ Z, C(a) is not all of G; moreover, C(a) < G, therefore\ndim(C(a)) = 0, and thus dim(Ua ) = 1, and similarly for Ub .\nClaim 21. For every a, b \u2208 G \\ Z, a is a conjugate of b.\nIn fact, by connectedness and the above claim, Ua \u2229 Ub 6= \u2205, and thus\nUa = Ub .\nClaim 22. For every x, y \u2208 G \\ {1}, x is a conjugate of y.\nIn fact, x = \u0101 and y = b\u0304 for some a, b \u2208 G \\ Z. By Claim 21, a and b are\nconjugate in G, and thus x and y are conjugate in G.\nThus, G is a definable (in the imaginary sorts) connected group of dimension 1, such that any two elements different from the identity are in the\nsame conjugacy class (and therefore G is torsion-free and has trivial centre).\nOne should now prove that such a group G cannot exists.\nNotice that the above conjecture is false if m > 1.\n52\n\n\fA. Fornasiero\n\nDimensions, matroids, and dense pairs. V. 2.8\n\nLemma 11.10. Assume that m = 1 and G is Abelian. Let p be a prime\nnumber. Then, either pG = 0, or G is divisible by p.\nProof. Let H := pG and K := {x \u2208 G : px = 0}. If dim(H) = 1, then\nG = H and therefore G is p-divisible. If dim(H) = 0, then dim(K) = 1, thus\nG = K and pG = 0.\nNotice that the above lemma needs the hypothesis that m = 1. For\ninstance, let M be the algebraic closures of Fp , and let G := M \u00d7 M\u2217 (where\nM\u2217 is the multiplicative group of M).\nTheorem 11.11. Assume that G expands an integral domain (and hG, +i\nis connected). Then, G is an algebraically closed field.\nCf. Macintyre's Theorem [Poizat87, 3.1, 6.11].\nProof. Let hG\u2217 , *i be the multiplicative semigroup of G. By Lemma 11.4,\nhG\u2217 , *i is a group, and therefore G is a field. For every n \u2208 N, consider the\nmap fn : G\u2217 \u2192 G\u2217 x 7\u2192 xn . Since fn has finite kernel, Lemma 11.6 implies\nthat fn is surjective, and therefore every element of G has an nth root in G.\nIn particular, G is perfect.\nLet p := char(G). If p > 0, consider the map h : G \u2192 G, x 7\u2192 xp + x.\nNotice that h is an additive homomorphism with finite kernel; hence, h is\nsurjective.\nSince Gl is also connected for every 0 < l \u2208 N, the above is true not only\nfor G, but also for every finite-degree extension G1 of G.\nThe rest of the proof is the same as in [Poizat87, 3.1]: G contains all\nroots of 1 (because G\u2217 is divisible), and, if G were not algebraically closed,\nthere would exists a finite extension G1 and normal finite extension L of G1 ,\nsuch that the Galois group of L/G1 is cyclic and of prime order q. If q 6= p,\nthen L/G1 is a Kummer extension, absurd. If q = p, then L/G1 is an ArtinSchreier extension, also absurd.\nIn the above theorem it is essential that G is connected. For instance, if\nM is a formally p-adic field, then M itself is a non-algebraically closed field\n(of dimension 1). Notice also that the first step in the proofs of [Poizat87,\n3.1, 6.11] is showing that G is connected.\nQuestion 11.12. Can we weaken the hypothesis in the above theorem from\n\"G expands an integral domain\" to \"G expands a ring without zero divisors\"?\n53\n\n\f12.

By Remark 10.5.\nExamples 12.7. The ultraproduct K of strongly minimal structures is not\nstrongly minimal in general (it will not even be a pregeometric structure),\nbut if each structure expands a ring without zero divisors, then K will have\na (unique) existential matroid, and will \u0001be cl-minimal.\nIt is easy to find a family K = Ki i\u2208N of strongly minimal structures\nexpanding a field, such that any non-principal ultraproduct of K K is not\npregeometric, does satisfy the Independence Property, and has an infinite\ndefinable subset with a definable linear ordering. Moreover, one can also\nimpose that the trivial chain condition for uniformly definable subgroups\nof hK, +i fails in K [Poizat87, 1.3]. However, K will satisfy the following\nconditions:\n1. Every definable associative monoid with left cancellation is a group\n[Poizat87, 1.1];\n2. Given G a definable group acting in a definable way on a definable\nset E, if E is a definable subset of A and g \u2208 G such that g * A \u2286 A,\nthen g * A = A [Poizat87, 1.2].\nWe do not know if conditions (1) and (2) in the above example are true\nfor an arbitrary cl-minimal structure expanding a field.\nRemark 12.8. Assume that each Ki is a first-order topological structure,\nand that the definable basis of the topology of each Ki is given by the same\nfunction \u03a6(x, \u0233). Then, K is also a first-order topological structure, and\n\u03a6(x, \u0233) defines a basis for the topology of K.

If T is cl-minimal, then T n is complete for every n \u2265 1 (and\ntherefore coincides with T (n\u22121)d ).

By induction on n, we will prove T nd coincides with (. . . (T d )d . . . )d\niterated n times. This implies both that T nd is complete, and that it has an\nexistential matroid.\nIt suffices to treat the case n = 2. Notice that hK2 , K1 i \u227a hK3 , K1 i |= T d .\nIt suffices to show that K2 is Scl-dense in hK3 , K1 i.

If moreover\nM eliminates the quantifier \u2203\u221e , then M is geometric.\nIn this section we gather various results about (pre)geometric structures,\nmainly in order to clarify and motivate the general case of structures with\nan existential matroid.\nRemember that M has geometric elimination of imaginaries if every for\nimaginary tuple \u0101 there exists a real tuple b\u0304 such that \u0101 and b\u0304 are interalgebraic.\n58\n\n\f:geometric-density\n\nA. Fornasiero\n\nDimensions, matroids, and dense pairs. V. 2.8\n\nRemark 14.1. T is pregeometric iff T is a real-rosy theory of real \u00fe-rank 1.\nMoreover, if T is pregeometric and has geometric elimination of imaginaries,\nthen \u2323\n|\u00fe = \u2323\n|acl, and dimacl is equal to the \u00fe-rank: see [EO07] for definitions\nand proofs.\nRemark 14.2. The model-theoretic algebraic closure acl is a definable closure operator.\nFact. Let M be a definably complete and d-minimal expansion of a field.\nThen, M has elimination of imaginaries an definable Skolem functions; moreover, M is rosy iff it is o-minimal. In particular, an ultraproduct of o-minimal\nstructures expanding a field is rosy iff it is o-minimal.\nThe proof of the above fact will be given elsewhere.\nFor the remainder of this section, M is pregeometric (and T is its theory).\nRemark 14.3. acl is an existential matroid on M. The induced independence relation \u2323\n|acl coincides with real \u00fe-independence \u2323\n|\u00fe and with the Mdividing notion \u2323\n|M of [Adler05]. A formula is x-narrow (for acl) iff it is\nalgebraic in x.\nRemark 14.4. Let X \u2286 Mn be definable. dimacl (X) = 0 iff X is finite.\nRemark 14.5. M is geometric iff dimacl is definable.\nRemark 14.6. M is acl-minimal iff it is strongly minimal.\n \u0303 the extension of acl to the imaginary sorts.\nIn \u00a76 we defined acl,\n \u0303\nRemark 14.7. If a is real and B is imaginary, then a \u2208 acl(B)\niff a \u2208\neq\nacl (B).\nRemark 14.8. T.f.a.e.:\n1. acleq coincides with the extension of acl defined in \u00a76;\n2. T is superrosy of \u00fe-rank 1 [EO07];\n3. T is surgical [Gagelman05].\nRemark 14.9. X is dense in M iff for every U infinite definable subset of M,\nU \u2229 X 6= \u2205. If F \u0016 K, then F is acl-closed in K.\nRemark 14.10. Assume that T is geometric. Then, T 2 is the theory of pairs\nhK, Fi, with F \u227a K |= T , and T d is the theory of pairs hK, Fi |= T 2 , such that\nF is dense in K. For every X \u2286 K, Scl(X) = acl(FX) (cf. Question 8.38).\nFor more on the theory T d in the case when T is geometric, and in particular when T is o-minimal, see [Berenstein07].\n59\n\n\fReferences\n\nReferences\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank H.
