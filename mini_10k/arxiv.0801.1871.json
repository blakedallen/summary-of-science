In the field of the quantum state control by optical means,\nboth Rabi oscillation and quantum interference play the central roles. The exciton Rabi splitting\nwas observed in the luminescence spectrum of a single InGaAs quantum dot and the exciton\nRabi oscillation was also observed in the spectroscopy of a single GaAs or InGaAs quantum\ndot [6\u201312]. The two-qubit CROT (controlled rotation) gate operation was demonstrated using\ntwo orthogonally polarized exciton states and a biexciton state in a GaAs quantum dot [13].\nUnfortunately, however, the decoherence/dephasing times of excitons and biexcitons in these\nquantum dots are limited by the radiative lifetimes(\u223c 1 ns) even at low temperatures. Thus a\nqubit with a longer decoherence time is desirable for the application to the quantum information\nprocessing. Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are considered as one of the\nmost promising candidates of the building blocks for quantum information processing [14, 15]\ndue to their robustness against decoherence effects [16, 17]. In double QD systems, initialization and coherent manipulation of the electron spin have been realized, with coherence times\nextending to 1 \u03bcs [18, 19].\nRecently, a quantum media converter from a photon qubit to an electron spin qubit was\nproposed for quantum repeaters [20, 21]. Quantum information can take several different forms\n\n\fand it is preferable to be able to convert among different forms. One form is the photon polarization and another is the electron spin polarization. Photons are the most convenient medium\nfor sharing quantum information between distant locations. However, it is necessary to realize a\nquantum repeater in order to send the information securely over a very long distance overcoming\nthe photon loss. A quantum repeater requires two essential ingredients, namely, the quantum\nstate transfer between a photon and an electron spin and the correlation (Bell) measurement\nbetween two electrons created by the quantum state transfer from two different photons. Additionally it is desirable to have a long-lived quantum memory based on the nuclear spins. For the\nquantum state transfer, a strained InGaAs/InP quantum dot was proposed as a preferable device\nbased on the g-factor engineering [22]. In the actual operation, the photoexcited holes are to\nbe quickly swept out of the quantum dot to project the photon polarization onto the electron\nspin polarization, preserving the quantum coherence. We have analyzed the performance of this\noperation and clarified the conditions to be satisfied to achieve a high value of the purity of the\ntransferred quantum state or the fidelity of the quantum state transfer.\nAnother fundamental element for realizing the quantum repeater is the Bell (quantum correlation) measurement for the entanglement swapping. In our case this measurement is carried\nout for two electrons which are created by the quantum state transfer from two separate photons.\nHere we propose an optical method to do this Bell measurement based on the Faraday (in the\ntransmission geometry) or Kerr (in the reflection geometry) rotation and estimate the feasibility.\nThe electron spin decoherence time reported so far for low temperatures is about a few microsecond and is not sufficiently long for the secure quantum information processing. Thus\nthe nuclear spin quantum memory will be eventually required and the robust quantum state\ntransfer should be realized between the electron spin and the nuclear spins in order to store\nand retrieve the quantum information. For that purpose, the fundamental features of dynamics\nin the electron-nuclei coupled system should be investigated. Here we reveal a sequence of\nback-actions between the electron spin and the nuclear spins through the quantum state measurements and predict a couple of new phenomena. These findings will open the way to realize\nthe quantum state purification of nuclear spins, elongation of the electron spin decoherence time\nand the nuclear spin quantum memory.\n\n2 QUANTUM STATE TRANSFER\nIn the quantum state transfer between the photon qubit and the electron qubit, the one-to-one\ncorrespondence should be established between the photon polarization and the electron spin\npolarization. In other words, the one-to-one correspondence between the Poincare sphere for\na photon and the Bloch sphere for an electron spin should be realized as perfectly as possible.\nSince the photon energy is independent of the polarization direction, the electron energy should\nalso be independent of the spin direction. This can be realized by the g-factor engineering [22].\nThe light-hole exciton is preferable than the heavy-hole exciton because of the characteristic\noptical selection rule and the possible Zeeman splitting in the in-plane magnetic field. In order\nto have the light-hole states as the ground hole states, the strained quantum well (QW) structure\nis necessary and can be realized in InGaAs/InP QW structures. In these strained QW structures\nthe light-hole states are written as [23]\nr\nr\n31\n2\n1\n|10i|\u03b1i +\n|11i|\u03b2i ,\n(1)\n| i=\n22\n3\n3\nr\nr\n3 1\n1\n2\n| \u2212 i=\n|1 \u2212 1i|\u03b1i +\n|10i|\u03b2i ,\n(2)\n2 2\n3\n3\nwhere the usual angular momentum representation |j, mi is employed and |10i|\u03b1i indicates a\npz -like orbital with the up-spin, for example.

Assuming |lh1 i to be the ground\nhole state (namely, glh > 0), we have the optical selection rules:\n1\n|lhi1 \u2212\u2192 \u221a (|c \u2191i \u2212 |c \u2193i) = \u2212 |e1 i\n2\n\n(7)\n\nfor the x\u2212polarized light and\n\u2212i\n|lhi1 \u2212\u2192 \u221a (|c \u2191i + |c \u2193i) = \u2212i |e2 i\n2\n\n(8)\n\nfor the y\u2212polarized light, respectively, where |c \u2191 (\u2193)i represents the conduction band electron\nstate with the up (down) spin in the z direction and |e1 i(|e2 i) is the electron eigenstate with the\nspin aligned in the \u2212x (x) direction. The schematic energy levels are plotted in Fig. 1.\nAccording to these selection rules, we can excite a linear combination of exciton states\nwhich have a common hole state. When a linearly polarized light comes in with polarizaion\ngiven by\ncos \u03b8 x\u0302 + sin \u03b8 \u0177 ,\n(9)\nthe excited state can be written as\n\u2212 cos \u03b8|e1 i|lh1 i \u2212 i sin \u03b8|e2 i|lh1 i = \u2212 cos \u03b8|e1 , h1 i \u2212 i sin \u03b8|e2 , h1 i ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the direct product state |e1 i|lh1 i is simply denoted by |e1 , h1 i for example and the representation in the form of the electron-hole pair is used instead of the exciton representation. It is\nbeyond the scope of this article to discuss fully the exciton effect in the quantum state transfer.\n\n\f|e2>\n|e1>\n\n|h3>\n\n|h2>\n\n|h1>\n\nFig. 2. Schematic relaxation paths in the quantum state transfer from a photon to an electron spin. Curved\narrows indicate the transfer (tunneling) process of the photoexcited hole. |h3i represents symbolically the\nfinal destination of the extracted hole.\nNow we study influences of relaxation processes of the electron and the hole on the quantum\nstate transfer. In the case of a gate-controlled quantum dot, the electron is three-dimensionally\nconfined, whereas the hole is not confined and is absorbed into the negatively biased gate, leaving behind only the photoexcited electron. Thus the important issue is the quantum nature of\nthe electron state after extraction of the hole: How much is the electron spin coherence retained\nafter the process ? To answer this question, we will analyze the time evolution of the whole\nsystem based on the density matrix formalism. Just after the photoexcitation given by Eq. (10),\nthe density matrix of the electron-hole system is supposed to be given by\n\u03c1(t = 0) = cos2 \u03b8|e1 , h1 ihe1 , h1 | + sin2 \u03b8|e2 , h1 ihe2 , h1 |\n\n+i sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8|e2 , h1 ihe1 , h1 | \u2212 i sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8|e1 , h1 ihe2 , h1 | .\n\n(11)\n\nThen the hole is extracted into the negatively biased gate electrode. In order to simulate this\nprocess, we introduce a model consisting of three hole states as depicted in Fig. 2; one of\nthem is the hole state |h1 i created in a quantum dot by the photoexcitation, the second one is\nan intermediate hole state |h2 i representing a delocalized state around the gate electrode and\nthe third one is the swept-out state in the gate. The most important mechanism degrading the\nelectron spin coherence is the electron-hole exchange interaction which induces the spin state\nmixing. During the hole extraction to the negatively biased electrode the hole spin relaxation\noccurs and the electron spin states are mixed up, leading to the degradation of quantum state\ntransfer.\n\n2.1 Dynamics of quantum state transfer\nTo set up the equations of motion for the density matrix, we take into account six basis states\ncomposed of direct products of two electron states |e1 i and |e2 i and three hole states |h1 i , |h2 i\nand |h3 i:\n|e1 , h1 i, |e2 , h1 i, |e1 , h2 i, |e2 , h2 i, |e1 , h3 i, |e2 , h3 i .\n(12)\n\n\fIn this representation, the equation of motion for the density matrix is given by\ni\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212 [H, \u03c1] + \u0393\u03c1 ,\n~\nH = H0 + Hexch. ,\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nH0 = Ee (|e1 ihe1 | + |e2 ihe2 |) \u2212 Eh1 |h1 ihh1 | \u2212 Eh2 |h2 ihh2 | \u2212 Eh3 |h3 ihh3 | , (15)\n\u0393\u03c1 = t12 |h2 ihh1 |\u03c1|h1 ihh2 | + t23 |h3 ihh2 |\u03c1|h2 ihh3 | \u2212 t12 |h1 ihh1 |\u03c1|h1 ihh1 |\nX\nh\n\u2212t23 |h2 ihh2 |\u03c1|h2 ihh2 | \u2212\n\u03b3ij\n{|hi ihhi |\u03c1|hj ihhj | + |hj ihhj |\u03c1|hi ihhi |}\ni6=j\n\n+\u03b31e |e2 ihe1 |\u03c1|e1 ihe2 | \u2212 \u03b31e |e1 ihe1 |\u03c1|e1 ihe1 |\n\ne\n\u2212\u03b312\n{|e1 ihe1 |\u03c1|e2 ihe2 | + |e2 ihe2 |\u03c1|e1 ihe1 |} ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere tij is the transfer (tunneling) rate from the hole state |hi i to |hj i, \u03b31e the electron spin\ne\nrelaxation rate from the electron state |e1 i to |e2 i, \u03b312\nthe electron spin decoherence rate and\nh\n\u03b3ij is the dephasing rate of the hole state coherence between |hi i and |hj i. Concerning the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction we employ the following Hamiltonian:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n|e1 h1 i |e2 h1 i |e1 h2 i |e2 h2 i |e1 h3 i |e2 h3 i\n\uf8ec |e1 h1 i\n\uf8f7\n1\n0.9\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec |e2 h1 i\n\uf8f7\n0.9\n1\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 , (17)\n0.1\n0.05\n0.2\n0.18\n0\n0\nHexch. = W * \uf8ec |e1 h2 i\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec |e2 h2 i 0.05\n\uf8f7\n0.1\n0.18\n0.2\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed |e1 h3 i\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n|e2 h3 i\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nwhere the matrix elements associated with the hole state |h3 i is set to be zero because it is\nthe swept-out state into the gate. The short-range electron-hole exchange interaction is small\nsince the spatial overlap between the |h3 i state and other states is negligible and the long-range\nelectron-hole exchange interaction due to the dipole-dipole interaction may also be small. The\nnumerical values in Eq. (17) are given semi-empirically.\n\n2.2 Purity and fidelity of quantum state transfer\nThe time evolution of the whole system can be examined by the numerical integration of the\nequation (13). The initial state is supposed to be given by Eq. (11). After a sequence of\ntunneling processes, the hole is eventually settled into the state |h3 i. At this stage we are\nconcerned with the quantum coherence of the electron spin state. To examine the quantum\ncoherence we calculate the reduced density matrix of the electron by taking the trace over the\nhole states of the density matrix for the whole system :\n\u03c1electron = Trhole \u03c1 .\n\n(18)\n\nThen the purity of the electron state is estimated by\nP = Tr \u03c12electron .\n\n(19)\n\nWe compared the purity for two cases of favorable and unfavorable conditions for the quantum\nstate transfer. In the favorable case, the magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction\ndenoted by W is taken to be 3 \u03bceV and the hole transfer (tunneling) time (1/t12 = 1/t23 =1\nps) is short enough to suppress the spin state mixing by the electron-hole exchange interaction.\nResults are not sensitive to the polarization angle \u03b8 of the excitation light in Eq. (9) and are\nexhibited in Fig. 3. The purity is high enough (> 0.9999) over a nanosecond to guarantee\n\n\f(a)\n(b)\n\nPurity/Fidelity\n\n0.9999\n0.9998\n0.9997\n0.9996\n0.9995\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n600\nTime (ps)\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFig. 3.

Time evolution of the purity (a) of the electron spin state and the fidelity (b) of the quantum state\ntransfer after photoexcitation for the case of unfavorable conditions.\n\nthe secure quantum state transfer. The decay of the purity is determined by the electron spin\ndecoherence/relaxation times which are supposed here to be\nT1 = 1/\u03b31e = 100 \u03bcs ,\n\ne\nT2 = 1/\u03b312\n= 1 \u03bcs .\n\n(20)\n\nIn the unfavorable case, the magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (W = 20 \u03bc\neV) is rather large and the hole tunneling time (1/t12 = 1/t23 =10 ps) is not short enough\nto suppress the spin state mixing by the electron-hole exchange interaction. In this case also,\nresults are not sensitive to the polarization angle of the excitation light and are exhibited in Fig.\n4. The purity decreases rapidly within several tens of picoseconds after photoexcitation due to\nthe electron-hole exchange interaction. The characteristic time scale is given by ~/W and is 33\nps. Then the purity is decreasing slowly due to the electron spin decoherence itself (\u223c 1 \u03bcs).\nWe also examined the fidelity of the quantum state transfer. Ideally we want to prepare the\nelectron spin state corresponding to the photon polarization state in Eq. (9) as\n\u03c10electron = cos2 \u03b8|e1 ihe1 | + sin2 \u03b8|e2 ihe2 | + i sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8|e2 ihe1 | \u2212 i sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8|e1 ihe2 | . (21)\n\n\fThe fidelity is defined by\nF (t) = Tr \u03c10electron \u03c1electron(t) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c1electron(t) is the reduced density matrix of the electron defined in Eq. (18). This quantity\nindicates to what extent the actual state is close to the ideally prepared state. The results are\nexhibited by curves (b) in Figs. 3 and 4. Qualitative features are the same as in the case of\npurity.\nBased on these results, we can conclude that for the secure quantum state transfer we have to\nextract the photoexcited hole quickly before the spin state mixing sets in due to the electron-hole\nexchange interaction. The model used here has an empirical character and a more quantitative\nanalysis would be necessary for the definite design of experiments of quantum state transfer\n[24, 25].\n\n3 QUANTUM CORRELATION (BELL) MEASUREMENT BETWEEN TWO\nELECTRONS\nIn the scheme of quantum repeater, the primary elements are the quantum state transfer between a photon and an electron and the entanglement swapping through the Bell (correlation)\nmeasurement between two electrons which are created through the quantum state transfer from\ntwo photons. It is preferable to do the Bell measurement between electrons instead of photons because the mismatch between the photon arrival times can be compensated by the rather\nlong coherence time of electrons, whereas the storage of photons is rather difficult although the\ntechniques for the photon storage are progressing steadily. Thus we start the discussion assuming that two electrons are prepared in a semiconductor nanostructure, e.g., a quantum dot. We\npropose an optical method to measure the spin state of two electrons based on the Faraday or\nKerr rotation. Here we employ a linearly polarized off-resonant probe light and measure the\norientation of the transmitted (reflected) light. Thus the method can be non-destructive in the\nsame sense as demonstrated for the case of a single electron [26, 27].\nBefore going into details, let us review briefly the elementary processes of the Faraday\nrotation for the case of a single electron. We consider a III-V semiconductor quantum dot in\nwhich the hole ground state is the heavy hole state and a magnetic field is applied along the\ncrystal growth direction (namely, perpendicular to the quantum well plane). As is well known,\nthe right-circularly polarized light denoted by \u03c3+ excites a down spin electron from the valence\nband state |3/2, \u22123/2i creating a charged exciton or trion, while the left-circularly polarized\nlight denoted by \u03c3\u2212 excites an up spin electron from the valence band state |3/2, 3/2i, as\nexhibited in Fig. 5. When we probe the system with a linearly polarized light along the x\ndirection, i.e.,\n1\n(23)\n|xi = \u221a (|\u03c3+ i + |\u03c3\u2212 i) ,\n2\none of the circular components receives a phase shift and the Faraday rotation occurs. Thus we\ncan distinguish the two spin states of an electron by the sign of the Faraday rotation angle.\nNow we extend this argument to the case of two electrons and consider relevant elementary\nprocesses for four states of two electrons, namely, the singlet state(S) and the triplet states with\nthe magnetic quantum number 1, 0 and -1 (T1 , T0 , T\u22121 ). For the T1 state, spins of the two\nresident electrons are aligned in the same direction and a \u03c3+ polarized light excites a down spin\nelectron from the valence band creating a doubly negatively charged exciton X 2\u2212 , as shown in\nFig. 6, in which the lowest electron orbital state is occupied by a spin-singlet electron pair and\nthe spin direction of the electron in the second lowest orbital state is indicated in the superscript\nand the spin direction of the hole is depicted in the subscript. This T1 state is optically inactive\nfor the \u03c3\u2212 polarized light. For the T\u22121 state, a \u03c3\u2212 polarized light excites an up spin electron\nfrom the valence band creating another doubly negatively charged exciton. This T\u22121 state is\noptically inactive for the \u03c3+ polarized light. Thus these two states can be distinguished by the\n\n\fFig. 5. Elementary processes of the Faraday rotation for the case of a single resident electron. \u03c3+(\u2212)\ndenotes the right (left) circularly polarized light. The upper (lower) horizontal line indicates the electron\n(hole) level. A thin (thick empty) arrow represents an electron (a hole) with the spin direction along the\narrow.\n\nFig. 6. Elementary processes of the Faraday rotation for the triplet T1 and T\u22121 states of two resident\nelectrons.\n\nFig. 7. Elementary processes of the Faraday rotation for the singlet S state of two resident electrons.\nsign of the Faraday rotation angle. On the other hand, the S and T0 states are optically active\nfor both circular polarizations as exhibited in Figs. 7 and 8, and the sign of the Faraday rotation\nangle is determined by the competition between the phase shifts for each circular component.\nThe expression of the Faraday rotation angle is obtained in the perturbation theory and is\ncomposed of two terms:\n\u03c6\u221d\n\nX |hk|P\u03c3\u2212 |ii|2 (Ek,i \u2212 ~\u03c9)\nX |hj|P\u03c3+ |ii|2 (Ej,i \u2212 ~\u03c9)\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2 + (E\n2\n(~2 \u03b3j,i + (Ej,i \u2212 ~\u03c9)2 )\n(~2 \u03b3k,i\nk,i \u2212 ~\u03c9) )\n\nj(\u03c3+)\n\n(24)\n\nk(\u03c3\u2212)\n\nwhere i indicates the initial state of two electrons, j (k) the final state of the optical transition\nfor the \u03c3+ (\u03c3\u2212 ) component, Ea,b = Ea \u2212 Eb with Ea being the energy of the a state, \u03b3a,b\nthe dephasing rate corresponding to the a \u2194 b transition and ~\u03c9 denotes the photon energy of\nthe linearly polarized probe light. As mentioned before, for the T1 state only the \u03c3+ transitions\n\n\fFig. 8. Elementary processes of the Faraday rotation for the triplet T0 state of two resident electrons.\nX\u21d12\u2212\u2217 and X\u21d32\u2212\u2217 denote excited states of the doubly negatively charged exciton.\n\ncontribute, whereas for the T\u22121 state only the \u03c3\u2212 transitions contribute. Thus the two states can\nbe distinguished by the sign of the Faraday rotation angle. For the S and T0 states, both \u03c3+ and\n\u03c3\u2212 transitions contribute and thus more detailed arguments are necessary to determine the sign\nof the Faraday rotation angle. Now we examine the resonance position of the Faraday rotation\nangle with respect to the probe photon energy ~\u03c9. From the elementary processes exhibited in\nFigs. 6-8, it is seen that for the triplet states the resonance occurs at around the energy of the\ndoubly charged exciton states (E(X 2\u2212 )). On the other hand, for the singlet state the resonance\noccurs at a higher energy than E(X 2\u2212 ) because the lowest orbital state is already occupied by\na spin-singlet electron pair and the optical transition should occur to the higher orbital state.\nNow we discuss more details of the Faraday rotation angle for the case of T0 state. As\nmentioned before, both \u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212 circular components contribute to the Faraday rotation. The\nlowest-energy final state of the optical transition for each circular component is given by\nj(\u03c3+) = X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ,\n\nk(\u03c3\u2212) = X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 .\n\n(25)\n\nThe energies of these states are different in a magnetic field because the spin configuration is\ndifferent for these states. In terms of the electron g-factor gc(v) for the conduction (valence)\nband, these energies are given as\n1\nE(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ) \u223c\n= \u2212 (gc \u03bcB B \u2212 gv \u03bcB B) + E0 ,\n2\n1\nE(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 ) \u223c\n= (gc \u03bcB B \u2212 gv \u03bcB B) + E0 ,\n2\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhere E0 is the lowest energy of the interband transition. Then the energy difference |E(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 )\u2212\n\nE(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 )| is typically about one tenth of meV for a magnetic field about 1 Tesla and is comparable to the dephasing rate of the optical transitions. From the formula in Eq. (24) we see\nthat the dependence of the Faraday rotation angle on the probe photon energy is determined by\nthe difference between two dispersive curves with nearly equal resonance energies. Thus the\nprofile is given by the derivative of the dispersive curve as shown in Fig. 9, depending on the\nsign of the energy difference. The same situation holds for the singlet state S.\n\n\fFig. 9. Dependence on the probe photon energy (~\u03c9) of the Faraday rotation angle for the triplet T0 state\nand the singlet S state of two resident electrons. It depends on the sign of the energy difference; namely,\n(a) |E(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ) \u2212 E(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 )| > 0, (b) |E(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ) \u2212 E(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 )| < 0\n\nFig. 10. Dependence on the probe photon energy (~\u03c9) of the Faraday rotation angle for the three triplet\nstates T1 , T0 , T\u22121 and the singlet state S of two resident electrons. Those for T0 and S are exhibited for\nthe case of |E(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ) \u2212 E(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 )| > 0.\n\nSummarizing these considerations, we can show the schematic dependence of the Faraday\nrotation angle on the probe photon energy in Fig. 10. The triplet states T1 and T\u22121 exhibit\na typical dispersive lineshape. On the other hand, the profile for the triplet T0 and the singlet\nS states is given by the derivative of the dispersive curve, where the case of |E(X\u21d12\u2212\u2193 ) \u2212\n\nE(X\u21d32\u2212\u2191 )| > 0 is assumed. The resonance occurs at around the energy of the doubly charged\nexciton state denoted by E(X 2\u2212 ) for the triplet states, whereas for the singlet state it occurs\nat a higher energy than E(X 2\u2212 ) by the orbital excitation energy \u2206e . Thus when we choose\nthe probe photon energy at the downward arrow as shown in Fig. 10, the Faraday rotation\nangle is positive for the T1 state and is negative for the T\u22121 state. For the T0 state, the Faraday\nrotation angle is negative but the magnitude is small. For the singlet S state, the Faraday rotation\nangle would be vanishingly small because of the large off-resonance. Consequently, we can\ndistinguish between the four states of two electrons by the magnitude and the sign of the Faraday\nrotation angle.\n\n\fNow we discuss relevant parameters to optimize the Faraday rotation measurement. The\nessential requirement is the preparation of the lowest two orbital states which are energetically\nwell-separated from higher excited states. We consider a circularly symmetric GaAs quantum\ndot with parabolic lateral confinement under a magnetic field along the growth direction. Then\nthe orbital eigenstates are represented by the Fock-Darwin states [28, 29] whose eigenenergies\nare given by\n\nwith\n\nn\nE\u03bd,n = (|n| + 1 + 2\u03bd)~\u03a9 + ~\u03c9c\n2\nr\n2\n\u03c9\neB\n\u03a9 = \u03c902 + c , \u03c9c = \u2217 ,\n4\nm c\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nwhere \u03c90 is the frequency of the harmonic confinement in the lateral direction and m\u2217 is the\nelectron effective mass. When we employ the parameter values: ~\u03c90 = 5meV, B = 5T and\nm\u2217 = 0.067m0 with m0 being the free electron mass, we have ~\u03c9c = 8.7meV and ~\u03a9 =\n6.63meV. The lowest two orbital levels have the spacing of 2.3 meV and are well-separated\nfrom the higher orbital level by 8.7 meV. These parameter values would enable the Faraday\nrotation measurement to be carried out reliably.\n\n4 DYNAMICS IN ELECTRON-NUCLEI COUPLED SYSTEM\nAs mentioned in Sec. 1, the electron spin decoherence time reported so far for low temperatures\nis about a few microsecond and is not sufficiently long for the secure quantum information\nprocessing. Here the hyperfine (HF) interaction with the host nuclei [30, 31] is considered to be\nthe main decoherence mechanism, dominating over spin-orbit interactions which act on a time\nscale of tens of milliseconds [32,33] or even longer. Consequently there have been proposals to\nreduce the HF induced decoherence by measuring or polarizing the nuclear spins [34\u201338] and\nto use nuclear spins as a quantum memory [39].\nExtending these studies, we investigate the electron-nuclei spin coupling in quantum dots\n(QDs) and show that consecutive measurements of the electron spin state following the HF\ninteraction are correlated and lead to purification of the nuclear spin system. More specifically,\nstarting from an unknown initial state of nuclear spins, successive measurements of the electron\nspin state result in narrowing of the distribution of the nuclear spin field. We predict that the\npurification of the nuclear spin state would lead to the bunching of results of the electron spin\nstate measurements and also to the reduction in the electron spin decoherence induced by the HF\ninteraction. For the physical realization of the proposals we will in particular discuss a double\nQD occupied by two electrons, and a single QD occupied by one or two electrons. Under\nsufficiently high magnetic fields compared with the effective HF field (Overhauser field), these\nsystems provide the desired two-level system with a unidirectional HF field.\nFirst of all we consider an electrically gated double QD occupied by two electrons [18, 40].\nThe excited electronic orbitals of QDs have an energy much greater than the thermal energy\nand the adiabatic voltage sweeping rates, so that the electrons occupy only the ground state\norbitals. Under a high magnetic field where the electron Zeeman splitting is much greater than\nthe HF fields and the exchange energy, dynamics takes place in the spin singlet ground state\n|Si and triplet state of zero magnetic quantum number |T i. For the singlet state each electron\ncan be found in the different QD or both in the same QD, whereas for the triplet state electrons\ncan only be found in different QDs. In order to derive the effective Hamiltonian for the singlet\nand triplet states of two electrons each of which is lying in a different QD, we rewrite the HF\ninteraction for two electrons in the bases of singlet and triplet states and find that the mean HF\nfield induces mixing within triplet states and the difference of the HF fields in two QDs induces\ncoupling between the singlet and triplet states. When the Zeeman energy is much larger than\nthe HF fields, the coupling terms among the triplet states and those between |T\u00b1 i (triplet states\n\n\fwith the magnetic quantum number of 1 or -1) and the singlet state |Si can be neglected and the\nHF interaction reduces to\nVHF = \u03b4hz (|SihT | + h.c.)/2\n(30)\nwith \u03b4hz = hLz \u2212 hRz being the difference of the HF fields along the applied field direction\nin the left and right QDs. Including the exchange energy splitting J between |Si and |T i, the\neffective Hamiltonian is given as\nHe = JSz + r\u03b4hz Sx ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere S is the pseudospin operator with |T i and |Si forming the Sz basis and the parameter\nr characterizes the hybridization ratio of the singlet state whose two electrons are separated in\ndifferent QDs in the true singlet ground state. When both electrons are localized in the same\ndot, r \u2192 0 and J \u226b \u03b4hz . On the other hand, when they are located in different dots, the HF\ncoupling is maximized r \u2192 1 and J \u2192 0.\nIn the following we develop the arguments based on Eq. (31) assuming that the time scale\nof the nuclear spin variation is much longer than that of the electron spin measurements. Thus\nwe take into account only the static(inhomogeneous) distribution of the nuclear Overhauser\nfield but not the dynamical motion of the nuclear spin system itself due to the dipole-dipole\ninteraction which would induce additional decoherence of the electron spins.\n\n4.1 Bunching in electron spin measurements\nNow we show that by electron spin measurements in a double QD governed by Eq. (31), the\ncoherent behavior of nuclear spins can be demonstrated. Electron spins are initialized in the\nsinglet state and the nuclear spin states are initially in a mixture of \u03b4hz eigenstates:\nX\n\u03c1(t = 0) =\npn \u03c1n |SihS| ,\n(32)\nn\n\nwhere \u03c1n is a nuclear eigenstate with an eigenvalue hn :\nTr \u03c1n \u03b4hz = hn ,\n\nTr \u03c1n = 1 .\n\n(33)\n\npn is the probability of the hyperfine field \u03b4hz having the value hn . In the unbiased regime\nr = 1, the nuclear spins and the electron spins interact for a time span of t. The time evolution\nof the system is described as follows:\nX\nX\n\u03c1(t = 0) =\npn \u03c1n |SihS| \u2192 \u03c1(t) =\npn \u03c1n |\u03a8n ih\u03a8n | ,\n(34)\nn\n\nn\n\n|\u03a8n i = \u03b1n (t)|Si + \u03b2n (t)|T i ,\n\n(35)\n\n\u03b1n (t) = cos \u03a9n t/2 + iJ/\u03a9n sin \u03a9n t/2 , \u03b2n (t) = \u2212ihn /\u03a9n sin \u03a9n t/2 ,\np\n\u03a9n = J 2 + h2n .\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\nThen the gate voltage is swept adiabatically, switching off the HF interaction r \u2192 0, in a time\nscale much shorter than HF interaction time. Next a charge state measurement is performed\nwhich detects a singlet or triplet state. Probability to detect the singlet state is\nX\nPS (t) = Trnuc. hS|\u03c1(t)|Si =\npn |\u03b1n |2 ,\n(38)\nn\n\nwhere the nuclear states are traced out because they are not observed. In the same way the\nprobability to detect the triplet state is\nX\nPT (t) =\npn |\u03b2n |2 .\n(39)\nn\n\n\fAfter the first measurement, assuming that the outcome is the singlet, the system is in the state\ngiven by\n1 X\npn |\u03b1n |2 \u03c1n |SihS| ,\n(40)\nPS (t) n\nwhere PS (t) in the denominator is the normalization constant of the density matrix. In the\nsecond run we again initialize the system in the spin singlet state of the two electrons, preparing\nthe state:\n1 X\npn |\u03b1n |2 \u03c1n |SihS|\n(41)\n\u03c1\u2032 (t = 0) =\nPS (t) n\nand turn on the HF interaction. After the same period t as in the first run, the system evolves to\n\u03c1\u2032 (t) =\n\n1 X\npn |\u03b1n |2 \u03c1n |\u03a8n ih\u03a8n |\nPS (t) n\n\n|\u03a8n i = \u03b1n (t)|Si + \u03b2n (t)|T i ,\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\nwhere \u03b1n (t) and \u03b2n (t) are given in Eq. (36). Then the probability to detect the singlet state in\nthe second measurement PSS (t; t), where the first (second) subscript represents the outcome of\nthe first (second) measurement, is given by\nX\nPSS (t; t) = PS (t) * Trnuc. hS|\u03c1\u2032 (t)|Si =\npn |\u03b1n |4 ,\n(44)\nn\n\nwhere it is to be noted that the probability PS (t) of the first measurement cancels the normalization factor in Eq. (42). In the same way the probability to detect the triplet state in the second\nmeasurement PST (t; t) is given by\nX\nPST (t; t) =\npn |\u03b1n |2 |\u03b2n |2 .\n(45)\nn\n\nAfter the second measurement, assuming that the first (second) outcome is the singlet (triplet),\nthe system is in the state given by\nX\n1\npn |\u03b1n |2 |\u03b2n |2 \u03c1n |T ihT | ,\nPST (t; t) n\n\n(46)\n\nwhere PST (t; t) in the denominator is the normalization factor of the density matrix. In this\nway we can repeat many times of measurements.\nIn general over N measurements, the nuclear state conditioned on k (\u2264 N ) times singlet\nand N \u2212 k times triplet detection is\nN\u0001 X\n\u03c3N,k = k\npn |\u03b1n |2k |\u03b2n |2(N \u2212k) \u03c1n ,\n(47)\nn\n\nthe trace of which yields the probability of k times singlet outcomes\nPN,k = Tr \u03c3N,k =\n\nN\u0001\nh|\u03b1|2k |\u03b2|2(N \u2212k) i\nk\n\n,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere h. . .i is the ensemble averaging over the hyperfine field hn [31]. Hereafter, this case will\nbe referred to as the coherent regime.

These results are given particularly for J = 0. As J is increased\nthe probabilities approach each other and for J \u226b \u03c3 they become identical [41]. In Fig.\n\u2032\n11, for N = 20 measurements, PN,k and PN,k\nare shown for HF interaction times \u03c3\u03c4 =\n0.5, 1.5, and \u221e. For \u03c4 = 0, both probabilities are peaked at k = 20. However, immediately\nafter the HF interaction is introduced, the probability distributions show distinct behavior. The\nmeasurement results in the incoherent regime approach a Gaussian distribution. In the coherent\ncase the probabilities bunch at k=0 and 20 for J = 0, and when J/\u03c3 = 0.5 those bunch at\nk = 20 only. As J is increased above some critical value, no bunching takes place at k = 0\nsinglet measurement. When J is finite, the singlet state is energetically favored and the bunching of the singlet state outcome is more probable. Thus if the nuclear spins are coherent over\nthe span of the experiment, successive electron spin measurements are likely to be biased to all\nsinglet or triplet outcomes.\nWe discuss in brief the feasibility to observe the predicted phenomenon. The duration of the\ncycle involving electron spin initialization and measurement is about 10 \u03bcs [18]. The nuclear\nspin coherence time determined mostly by the nuclear spin diffusion is longer than about several\ntens of ms [42]. For a HF interaction of duration \u03c4 = 4\u03c3 \u22121 \u223c 40\u03bcs [18] in each step, the\nbunching can be observed for N successive measurements up to N \u223c 200.\n\n\f4.2 Purification of nuclear spin state and revival of the initial electron state\nThe nuclear spin state conditioned on the previous electron spin measurements is no longer\nrandom even if they are initially random. To be stated in more detail, the quantum correlation\nis built up in the nuclear spin system as a consequence of back-actions of the electron spin\nmeasurements. This quantum correlation affects in turn the outcomes of the electron spin measurements. In order to examine this situation, we consider the case: Starting from a random spin\nconfiguration, N successive electron spin measurements are performed, each following initialization of electron spins in the spin singlet state and a HF interaction of duration \u03c4i (i = 1 . . . N )\nand all the outcomes turn out to be the singlet. Then again the HF interaction is switched on for\na time t, and the (N + 1)-th measurement is carried out. The conditional probability to recover\nthe initial state, namely to observe again the singlet state, is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP QN +1 2 \u0001 \u2212 1 PN (sj \u22121)\u03c4\u0304j +(sN +1 \u22121)t\u0304 2\nj=1\n2\ne\ni=1\nsi\nP (t) =\n\u0003\n,\n(54)\n\u0002\nP QN 2 \u0001 \u2212 1 PN (sj \u22121)\u03c4\u0304j 2\nj=1\n2\n4\ne\ni=1 si\n\nwhere the sums run over si = 0, 1, 2 and \u03c4\u0304i = \u03c3\u03c4i . For the particular case of \u03c41 = \u03c42 = . . . =\n\u03c4N = \u03c4 \u226b 1/\u03c3, Eq. (54) can be approximated as\nP (t) \u2243 1/2 +\n\nN\nX\n\n(2N\ns )e\n\n\u2212\u03c32\n2\n\n(t\u2212(N \u2212s)\u03c4 )2\n\ns=0\n\n/2(2N\nN)\n\nfor \u03c4 \u226b 1/\u03c3 .\n\n(55)\n\nThis indicates a periodical recurrence of the initial state of the electron spin. Indeed the initial\nstate is revived at t = n\u03c4, (n = 1, 2, . . . , N ) with a decreasing amplitude:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n2N\n2N\n1/2 +\n/2\n.\n(56)\nN \u2212n\nN\nIn Fig. 12 the conditional probabilities in Eq. (54) are shown for \u03c3\u03c4 = 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 subject to\nN = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 times prior singlet measurements in each. Revivals or recurrences are observable only for \u03c3\u03c4 > 1, because the modulation period of the nuclear field spectrum characterized\nby 1/\u03c4 should be smaller than the variance \u03c3, as will be explained later.\nIn order to understand the mechanism of revivals, we examine the purity of the nuclear spin\nsystem. The purity of a system characterized by the density matrix \u03c1 is given by\nP = Tr \u03c12 .\n\n(57)\n\nWe consider the nuclear spin state prepared by N successive electron spin measurements in\nwhich all the outcomes are the singlet and the duration times of the HF interaction are \u03c41 , * * * , \u03c4N .\nThe purity of this nuclear spin state is calculated as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nQN 4 \u0001 \u2212 1 PN (sj \u22122)\u03c4\u0304j 2\nP4\nj=1\n2\n1\ni=1 si e\nsi =0\n\u0003\n\u0002\n,\n(58)\nP= \u0002\nQN 2 \u0001 \u2212 1 PN (sj \u22121)\u03c4\u0304j 2 \u00032\nD P2\nj=1\n2\ne\ni=1 si\nsi =0\n\nwhere D is the dimension of the Hilbert space for the nuclear spins. For a fixed ratio of \u03c41 :\n\u03c42 : . . . : \u03c4N , the purity in Eq. (58) is a monotonically increasing function of time. For\n\u03c4\u0304i = \u03c3\u03c4i \u226b 1, one can attain various asymptotic limits for the purity. For instance, for N = 2,\nthere are three asymptotic limits:\na) \u03c41 = 2\u03c42\nP = 11/4D ,\n(59)\n\n\f1\n\nP\n\nN=0\n\na)\n\nc)\n\nb)\n\nN=1\n\n0.8\n\nN=2\nN=5\n\n0.6\n0\n\nt\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\nt\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt\n\n15\n\nFig. 12.

Thus we can conclude that the mechanism of the revival phenomenon is\nthe purification of the nuclear spin system through the electron state measurements.\nPreviously, various methods have been proposed in order to control the nuclear spin system.\nA typical method is based on measurement of the HF field in a QD with some precision [36\u201338].\nIn the method proposed here, on the other hand, the nuclear spin state can be conditionally\npurified without determining the precise value of the HF field. Although the HF field is still\nassuming various values, the quantum correlation is built up, leading to the revival phenomenon.\nIn order to understand these features clearly, we simplify the situation by putting J = 0 in Eq.\n(36). Then the nuclear state density matrix, after N times electron spin measurements with all\nthe outcomes being the singlet, is given by\nX\n\u03c1nuc. \u221d\npn | cos hn \u03c4 /2|2N \u03c1n\n(64)\nn\n\nand the corresponding nuclear field spectrum or distribution function assumes a form of\np[h] = N e\u2212h\n\n2\n\n/2\u03c32\n\ncos2N [h\u03c4 /2] ,\n\n(65)\n\nwhere N is an appropriate normalization constant. Thus the modulation period of the nuclear\nfield spectrum is characterized by 1/\u03c4 . When this modulation period is larger than the width \u03c3\nof the initial Gaussian distribution, i.e., \u03c3\u03c4 < 1, the effect of modulation is not manifest. This\nexplains the absence of revivals in Fig. 12 a).\n\n\fSince the absolute value of a cosine function is less than unity, many times multiplication\nof the cosine function leads to sharpening of the distribution. Indeed, we can approximate for\nN \u226b 1 as\nX\n1\ncos2N \u03b8 =\n(1 \u2212 (\u03b8 \u2212 s\u03c0)2 + * * * )2N\n(66)\n2\ns\u2208Z\nX\nX\n=\n(1 \u2212 N (\u03b8 \u2212 s\u03c0)2 + * * * ) \u2243\nexp[\u2212N (\u03b8 \u2212 s\u03c0)2 ] .\n(67)\ns\u2208Z\n\ns\u2208Z\n\nThen Eq. (65) can be cast into a series of very narrow Gaussian functions\n2\n2\n2\n2 X\n2\n2\np[h] = N e\u2212h /2\u03c3 cos2N [h\u03c4 /2] \u2243 N e\u2212h /2\u03c3\ne\u2212(h\u2212hs ) /2\u03c3m\n\n(68)\n\ns\u2208Z\n\n\u22121\n\u03c3m\n=\u03c4\n\np\n\nN/2 , hs = 2s\u03c0/\u03c4 ,\n\n(69)\n\u221a\nwhere it is to be noted that the width of Gaussians is inversely proportional to N . Thus the\nnuclear field distribution function is squeezed by successive electron spin measurements and\nthis is the origin of increase in the purity of the nuclear state. Then the probability to have a\nsinglet outcome in the (N + 1)-th measurement after the HF interaction of period t is calculated\nas\nZ\n2\n2 X\n2\n2\nP (t) = hcos2 ht/2i = N dh cos2 (ht/2) e\u2212h /2\u03c3\ne\u2212(h\u2212hs ) /2\u03c3m\n(70)\ns\u2208Z\n\n2 2\n1 N X \u2212\u03c3m\nt /2 \u2212h2s /2\u03c32\n= +\ne\ne\ncos hs t .\n2\n2\n\n(71)\n\ns\u2208Z\n\nAt t = n\u03c4 , all cos hs t terms add up constructively leading to the revival phenomenon, namely,\na high probability to observe the spin singlet state periodically.\nSo far we have discussed the case in which the initial state of the electron pair is the singlet.\nBut these arguments can be extended to the case of an arbitrary initial state. When the initial\nstate of the electron pair is prepared as\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03a8(t = 0) = cos |Si + sin e\u2212i\u03c6 |T i ,\n2\n2\nthe probability to recover the initial state \u03a8(t = 0) at time t is calculated as\nF = Trnuc. h\u03a8(t = 0)|\u03c1(t)|\u03a8(t = 0)i\n= sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03c6)P (t)\n\n(72)\n\n(73)\n(74)\n\nwith P (t) given by Eq. (54). Thus the recurrence phenomenon can be observed for an arbitrary\ninitial state of the electron pair.\nFinally, as an example, we consider the case when the nuclear spin state is prepared by five\nHF interaction stages each of which has duration \u03c4 = 10/\u03c3 and is followed by a singlet detection of the electron spin state. This conditionally prepared nuclear spin state revives the initial\nelectron state at t = s\u03c4 (s = 1, 2, . . . , 5) with the probability of 11/12, 31/42, . . . , 253/504,\nrespectively. Success probability to prepare such a state is \u223c 1/32. Here preparation time is\nT = N (\u03c4 + \u03c4w ) where \u03c4w is the time needed for initialization and detection of the electron\nspin. During the HF interaction time \u03c4 , phonon-mediated interations which act on the time\nscale longer than millisecond [33] or any other electron spin decoherence mechanism except\nthe HF interaction should not take place. Furthermore the preparation time T should be smaller\nthan the nuclear diffusion time which is of the order of 10 ms [42]. Typically \u03c4w = 10 \u03bcs, and\nlet \u03c3 \u22121 = 10 \u03bcs [18]. For the discussed example (\u03c4 = 10/\u03c3, N = 5), the time needed for\npreparation of the desired nuclear spin state is T = 550 \u03bcs which is shorter than the nuclear\nspin diffusion time.\n\n\f4.3 Extension to general situations\nWe have so far discussed the bunching and revival phenomena only for two electrons in a double\nQD system. The same predictions can also be made for a single QD occupied by a single electron. Consider a single QD occupied by a single electron [43\u201345], under an external magnetic\nfield where the electron Zeeman energy is much greater than the HF energies. Then the system\nis described by the Hamiltonian:\nH \u2243 ge \u03bcB BSz + hz Sz ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere Sz is the z component of the electron spin operator, ge the electron g-factor, \u03bcB the\nBohr magneton and B is the external magnetic field applied in the z direction. Spin flips are\nsuppressed since\np\nge \u03bcB B \u226b hh2 i .\n(76)\nThe spin eigenstates along the x direction are given by\n\n\u221a\n|\u00b1i = (| \u2191i \u00b1 | \u2193i)/ 2 ,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere | \u2191i and | \u2193i are the eigenstates of Sz and they are coupled via the HF interaction. Thus\nthe relevant Hamiltonian in the basis of |\u00b1i is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n|+i\n|\u2212i\n0\n(ge \u03bcB Bz + hz )/2 \uf8f8 .\nH=\uf8ed\n(78)\n(ge \u03bcB Bz + hz )/2\n0\nThen the spin state measurement is carried out as follows. Each time the electron is prepared in\nthe |+i state. Next it is loaded onto the QD, then removed from the QD after some dwelling time\n\u03c4 . The spin measurement is performed in the |\u00b1i basis. Essentially the same predictions can\nbe made for this system as those for the case of double QD, namely the electron spin bunching\nand revival.\nWe can extend the arguments also to the case of a pair of electrons in a single QD [46,47] as\nthe Hamiltonian (31) can be used to describe the dynamics. Consequently, the same predictions\nas those for a double QD can be made [41]. Now we derive the Hamiltonian for an electron\npair in a single QD. Under a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the triplet states T\u00b1 with the\nmagnetic quantum number of \u00b11 are well separated from the triplet T0 state and the singlet state\nS. Thus the Hamiltonian within the subspace spanned by T0 and S states will be considered.\nThe wavefunctions for the S and T0 states are given, respectively, as\n1\n\u03a8S (r1 , \u03be1 , r2 , \u03be2 ) = \u03c6g (r1 )\u03c6g (r2 ) \u221a (\u03b1(\u03be1 )\u03b2(\u03be2 ) \u2212 \u03b2(\u03be1 )\u03b1(\u03be2 )) ,\n2\n1\n\u03a8T0 (r1 , \u03be1 , r2 , \u03be2 ) = (\u03c6g (r1 )\u03c6e (r2 ) \u2212 \u03c6e (r1 )\u03c6g (r2 ))\n2\n*(\u03b1(\u03be1 )\u03b2(\u03be2 ) + \u03b2(\u03be1 )\u03b1(\u03be2 )) ,\n\n(79)\n\n(80)\n\nwhere \u03c6g (\u03c6e ) is the ground (excited) orbital state in the QD and \u03b1 (\u03b2) denotes the spin up\n(down) state. The HF interaction for two electrons is given by\nX\nX\nS2 * Ii \u03b4(r2 \u2212 ri ) ,\n(81)\nS1 * Ii \u03b4(r1 \u2212 ri ) + Av0\nVHF = Av0\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere A is the HF coupling constant, v0 the volume of a unit cell, S (I) is the electron (nuclear)\nspin operator and the summation is carried out over nuclear spins at the location ri . Then we\nfind\nX\n1\n\u03c6\u2217e (ri )\u03c6g (ri )Iiz ,\n(82)\nh\u03a8T0 |VHF |\u03a8S i = \u2212 \u221a Av0\n2\ni\nh\u03a8S |VHF |\u03a8T0 i = h\u03a8T0 |VHF |\u03a8S i\u2217 , h\u03a8S |VHF |\u03a8S i = h\u03a8T0 |VHF |\u03a8T0 i = 0 . (83)\n\n\fThus the singlet-triplet mixing is induced by the HF interaction.

For the\nfirst element, we have analyzed the performance of the quantum state transfer and clarified the\nconditions to be satisfied to achieve a high value of the purity of the transferred quantum state\nor the fidelity of the operation. For the second element, we proposed an optical method to\ndistinguish between four states of two electrons based on the Faraday or Kerr rotation and confirmed the feasibility. For the third element, we studied the electron-nuclei coupled dynamics\nand predicted a couple of new phenomena related to the correlations induced by the hyperfine\ninteractions. The underlying mechanism is the squeezing or the increase in the purity of the\n\n\fnuclear spin state through the electron spin measurements. We can construct hopefully a secure and robust system of the quantum repeater combining these results, namely, the efficient\nquantum state transfer between a photon and an electron spin, the reliable Bell measurement\nof two electrons for the entanglement swapping based on the Faraday or Kerr rotation and the\nlong-lived quantum memory based on nuclear spins.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the financial supports from the CREST project of the Japan Science and Technology\nAgency, from the SCOPE program of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and\nfrom the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.
