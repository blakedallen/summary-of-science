Applications have been\nmade to bulk disordered alloys to benchmark our code.\n\n:\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this communication is to present and describe a computational\npackage to handle first-principles density functional (DFT) based studies of\nelectronic structure of systems without long-ranged lattice translational symmetry. Bulk disordered alloys and surfaces and interfaces which are either flat,\ncorrugated or rough fall under this category which our formalism should be\nable to take care of. The aim is also to go beyond the usual mean-field approaches like the coherent potential approximation (CPA) and be able to take\ninto account configuration fluctuations of the local environment. Lack of lattice\ntranslational symmetry means that the standard reciprocal space techniques\nbased on the powerful Bloch theorem can no longer be applicable and we shall\ndepend on alternative techniques based purely on real space approaches. Our\nformalism will be a marriage of three distinct methods which have been individually applied extensively : namely, the recursion method (RM) of Haydock\net.al. [1]-[2], the augmented space method proposed by one of us [3]-[4] (ASR)\nand the tight-binding, linear muffin-tin orbitals method (TB-LMTO) [5]. The\nlast mentioned provides us with a DFT self-consistent sparse representation of\n~ n Li} which spans the Hilbert\nthe Hamiltonian in a real-space minimal basis {|R\n1\n\n\f~ n labels the sites where the ion-cores sit and L = (lm\u03c3) are\nspace H. Here R\nthe angular momentum indexes. For a disordered system the matrix elements of\nthe Hamiltonian representation in this basis are random. This representation is\nthen taken over by the ASR to generate a modified Hamiltonian representation\nin the outer product space of H and the space C of configuration fluctuations\nof the random parameters. This modified Hamiltonian in the augmented space\nH \u2297 C represents a collection of all possible Hamiltonians for all possible configurations of Hamiltonian representations. Once this is done the RM allows\nus to obtain the matrix elements of the Green functions related to the KohnSham equation for the electronic states. The augmented space theorem (AST)\n[6] relates a specific matrix element of the Green function in the augmented\nspace H \u2297 C to the configuration averaged Green functions. The RM is a purely\nreal-space based technique, and therefore as applicable to a bulk system as one\nwith surfaces, interfaces or extended defects. In the following we shall describe\neach of the points raised above in some detail.\n\n2\n\nTight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals method\n\nThe TB-LMTO has been described in great detail earlier [5],[7]-[9]. We shall\nonly quote here the main results which will be relevant for setting up the ASR\nprogramme. The starting point is the Kohn-Sham equation with the muffin-tin\neffective crystal potential. The basis chosen for representation of the wave~ n Li} : If we expand the wave-function\nfunction are the muffin-tin orbitals {|R\nin terms of a linear combination of these muffin-tin orbitals and substitute the\nexpansion in the Kohn-Sham equation we obtain the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker\n(KKR) secular equation :\ndet k PR~ n L (E)\u03b4R~ n R~ m \u03b4LL\u2032 \u2212 SR~ n L,R~ n L\u2032 (\u03ba) k= 0\nEnergy linearization gives the eigen-type LMTO secular equation:\n(2)\n\u2032\n~\nn L,Rm L\n\ndet k E\u03b4R~ n R~ m \u03b4LL\u2032 \u2212 HR~\n\nk= 0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, the 'second order' Hamiltonian is given by :\n(2)\n\nH R~\n\n~\nn , Rm\n\n= E \u03bd \u03b4R~ n R~ m + hR~ n ,R~ m \u2212\n\nX\n\nhR~ n ,R~ k oR~ k hR~ k ,R~ m\n\n(2)\n\n~n\nR\n\nNote that each element is a matrix in the L space. In the screened representation the structure matrix S R~ n R~ m is short-ranged and the Hamiltonian is\nsparse :\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nhR~ n ,R~ m = (C R~ n \u2212 E \u03bd ) \u03b4R~ n R~ m + \u2206R~ S R~ n ,R~ m (0) \u2206R~\nn\n\n2\n\nm\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe expansion energies E\u03bdL are chosen suitably by us at the center of the\nenergy window of our interest and the potential parameters C, \u2206 and o are\ndiagonal in L space and are self-consistently generated. The structure matrix S\nis obtained from the geometry of the lattice. Note that the TB-LMTO basis is\nminimal and hence usually it is enough to take l \u2264 3 and in a majority of cases\none does not have to go beyond l = 2\nAt this point we should comment on several possible generalizations : we\nhave energy linearized the secular equation. In case we do not wish to do so,\nwe can still deal with a energy dependent \"Hamiltonian\" or \"secular matrix\"\nR(E) = P (E) \u2212 S(\u03ba). This is the TB-KKR. The subsequent recursion becomes\nenergy-dependent, however each recursion at each energy point can be parallely\ncarried out for efficiency. Such energy dependent recursion has been carried out\nby us earlier [10]. The assumption (a posteriori shown after calculations) was\nthat the recursion coefficients are weakly energy dependent, therefore recursion\nis carried out an equi-spaced \"seed\" points and the intermediate points found\nby interpolation. Further, if we allow for third-nearest neighbour sparsity in\nthe Hamiltonian we could start with the real-space full-potential LMTO (RSFPLMTO) of Eriksson et.al.[11].\n\n3\n\nThe Recursion method\n\nWhereas,the above formulation is general enough, we should stress on the fact\nthat the Hamiltonian representation is an infinite matrix. Lack of lattice translation symmetry means that we are unable to symmetry reduce the dimensionality\nof the matrix to essentially 2lmax + 1. We therefore have to resort to techniques\nwhich allow us to deal with infinite matrices. The Recursion method was exactly such a technique introduced by Haydock et.al.[1]-[2] to obtain the Green\nfunctions associated with the secular equation. This would give us the density\nof states from which we may obtain properties like the Fermi energy, the charge\nand magnetization densities, the magnetic moment and the band energy. A recent generalization also gives us correlation functions associated with response\nfunctions [12]-[13].\nThe RM begins by recursively changing the basis through a three term recurrence relation :\n~ i Li\n|1i = |R\n\n|n + 1i = H\n\n(2)\n\n|2i = H(2) |1i \u2212 \u03b11 |1i\n\nand\n\n|ni \u2212 \u03b1n |ni \u2212 \u03b2n2 |n \u2212 1i\n\nfor n > 1\n\n(4)\n\nMutual orthogonality of this new basis gives :\n\n\u03b1n =\n\nhn|H(2) |ni\nhn|ni\n\nand \u03b2n2 =\n\n3\n\nhn + 1|n + 1i\nhn|ni\n\n(5)\n\n\fTo understand how the above equations are efficiently operationally coded\non the computer, let us first describe the Hamiltonian as an operator H(2) .\nFrom Eqn.(2)\nH(2)\n\n=\n\nE\u03bd + h \u2212 h o h\n\nand\n\nh = C \u2212 E\u03bd + \u22061/2 S \u22061/2\n\n(6)\n\n1/2\nOf these operators fourPare 'diagonal' : EP\nand o. Their structure\n\u03bd , C, \u2206\nare all of the form : D = i Di |Ri ihRi | = i Di Pi .

The first step\nwould be to prepare the \"neighbour map\" (NM). The NM is a matrix N = Nij\nwhere Nij is the j-th neighbour of the i-th site on the lattice or network. We\nhave first to number the lattice/network points by integers. The near neighbour\nvectors point in different directions, while numbering this directionality has to be\n~ n and R\n~ m will depend\ncarefully recorded, since the structure matrix between R\n~\n~\nupon the direction of Rn \u2212 Rm . In figure 1 we show the geometry of a bulk\nsquare lattice, a square lattice with a plane surface (100), one with a corrugated\nsurface (110) and a network with four local bonds.\nSince the integer numbering increases always clockwise from a site, the directionality is preserved.

The space for these dummies may be dynamically allocated during\nthis procedure and released after the operation is over. The same is true for the\nvector |\u03a61 i in the Module REC.\nEqn. (5) indicates that in the new basis the Hamiltonian representation is\ntri-diagonal. It follows immediately that The Green function for the system is\ngiven by a continued fraction :\n\nGR~ i L,R~ i L (z) = h1|G(z)|1i =\n\n1\nz \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212\n\n\u03b212\nz \u2212 \u03b12 \u2212\n\n\u03b222\n..\n\n. z \u2212 \u03b1n0 \u2212 \u03b2n2 0 T (z)\n\n(7)\n\nThe asymptotic part of the Green function T (z) is called the Terminator.\nMany terminators are available in literature. The suitable one depends upon\nthe way in which the coefficients \u03b1n , \u03b2n2 behave as n \u2192 \u221e. The most commonly\nused is the square root terminator which is suitable when {\u03b1n , \u03b2n2 } \u2192 {\u03b1, \u03b2 2 }.\nLuchini and Nex [14] have suggested a modification when calculations up to a\nlarge n0 is not possible. If we carry out the terminator approximation after\nn0 steps the first 2n0 moments of the density of states are exact and it has\nbeen shown that the asymptotic moments are also accurately reproduced. Beer\nand Pettifor [15] have suggested an alternative way of obtaining the terminator. They note that T (z) = T (z, {\u03b1n , \u03b2n }, n \u2264 n0 ) so that the Beer-Pettifor\nprescription is a closed algorithm. It wins over the square-root terminator described above when the convergence of the coefficients is either oscillatory or\nslow. Viswanathan and Muller [16] have suggested several other terminators\nlike the terminator with an exponential tail, suitable when \u03b2n2 \u2192 n and the\nterminator with a Gaussian tail, suitable when \u03b2n2 \u2192 n2 .

The augmented space formalism [6] allows us to directly compute the\nconfiguration average of the Green function by constructing a Hamiltonian in\nthe augmented space of configurations of the random parameters. The formalism is based on ideas prevalent in quantum measurement theory : we associate\nwith each random parameter ni an operator Ni whose spectrum {n\u03bbi } are the\nmeasured values of the parameter. The configuration state of ni are the eigenkets {|n\u03bbi i} of Ni , which, therefore is an operator in the space Ci spanned by\nthe different configuration states. Given this, the probability density of the\nparameter is\np(ni ) = \u2212\n\n\u0001\u22121\n1\n|\u2205i i\nIm h\u2205i | (ni + i0)I \u2212 Ni\n\u03c0\n8\n\n\fwhere\n|\u2205i i =\n\nX p\np(\u03bb)|n\u03bbi i\n\u03bb\n\nThe augmented space theorem [6] then gives us the configuration average of\nany function of the random variables :\ne\n\u226a \u03a6({ni }) \u226b= h\u2205|\u03a6({N\ni })|\u2205i\n\nHere,\n\n(9)\n\nQ\u2297\n(i) |\u2205i = i |\u2205i i. It is a member of the basis set |{C}i = {|n\u03bb1 1 , n\u03bb2 2 , . . .i}\nwhich spans the configuration space \u03a8 of the set of random parameters\n{ni }.\nQ\u2297\ne\nCi . It is the\n(ii) \u03a6({N\ni }) is an operator in the configuration space \u03a8 =\nsame operator functional of {Ni } as \u03a6({ni }) was a function of {ni }.\n(iii) The expression is exact. The configuration average is done exactly first,\nthen the approximations may be carried out maintaining various physical\nconstraints. The philosophy is very different from the mean-field approximations like the CPA.\nIf we apply this to the configuration averaged Green function of a random\nHamiltonian H (2) ({ni }) :\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\ne (2) ({N\nei }\n\u226a GR~ i L,R~ i L (z, {ni }) \u226b= hRi \u2297 \u2205| z Ie \u2212 H\n|Ri \u2297 \u2205i\n\n(10)\n\nLet us take as an example the case of a disordered binary alloy : the Hamiltonian has the same form as Eqn.

(6)-(7) it becomes clear\nthat once we have defined the Hamiltonian in the space of configurations, the\nrecursion method may be directly used to obtain the configuration averaged\nGreen function. The approximation involved will then only be the \"termination\" approximation. Heine's \"Black-body theorem\" [17] indicates that most\nelectronic structure energetics is dominated by the immediate environment of a\nsite. This is a major justification of the termination approximation. Unlike the\nCPA which gives only the first eight moments of the density of states exactly\nand the asymptotic moments accurately, the augmented space recursion gives\n2n0 moments exactly (where the termination is done after n0 steps) and the\nasymptotic moments also accurately. In most of our calculations we can take\nn0 about 8-9 steps.\n\n5\n\nThe TB-LMTO-ASR Algorithm\n\nThe full package is divided into several modules. The first is the Preparation\nModule. This module has two branches, one each for each constituent of the\nalloy. Each branch runs parallely in two different slave processors. The structure\nmatrix is prepared in the master processor. This Module prepares the following\n:\n(i) It prepares the two control files for the different alloy constituents. This\npart is interactive with the user.\n10\n\n\f(ii) It carries out the simple Hartree calculation and prepares the atomic radii\nof the constituents and the initial charge density.\n(iii) It calculates the overlap between atomic spheres and inputs empty spheres\nmaintaining the symmetries.\n(iv) It calculates the structure matrix from the inputs of the control files.\nThe Preparation Module is followed by the main ASR-module. This module\nis called by the routine lmasr. This main module is divided into five smaller\nmodules :\n(i) Module A : This module reads the data generated by the Preparation\nModule. It checks the inputs for consistency. The routines in this module\nare again those in the Stuttgart LMTO47, but modified to read the inputs\nfor both the two constituents of the alloy.\n(ii) Module B: At the start of the DFT self-consistency loop, this module\ntakes the overlap of a simple Hartree atomic density calculation in the\nPreparation module and generates the Hartree and exchange-correlation\npotentials, spheridizes them and inputs them to the Atomic Module that\nfollows. In later steps of the self-consistency loop, this Module first mixes\nthe charge densities of the earlier steps and prepares the Hartree and\nexchange-correlation potentials,spheridizes them for input into the Atomic\nModule.\n- At this point there is a choice of using either the standard DFT exchangecorrelation potentials or, alternatively, there is a branch module HarbolaSahni which sets up the Harbola-Sahni potential for the study of excited\nstates [19].\n(iii) Module C: This is the Atomic Module. It takes the spheridized KohnSham potential generated in Module B and solves the radial Kohn-Sham\nequation numerically. The Kohn-Sham orbitals and energies then lead\nto the potential parameters for each constituent. Those for the two constituents are calculated on different processors. The parameters are first\ncalculated in the orthogonal representation. A new routine gtoa, not\npresent in the Stuttgart LMTO47 package, then transforms them to the\nmost screened tight-binding representation.\n(iv) Module D : This is the main ASR Module. The routines herein have\nbeen fully developed by us and form the main backbone of the package.\nThe input are the tight-binding Hamiltonian parameters from the Atomic\nModule. First they are combined with the alloy composition to prepare the\naugmented space Hamiltonian. The nearest neighbour map in augmented\nspace is then generated. Next, the recursion is carried out for each L\n11\n\n\fFigure 2: (Color Online) The TB-LMTO-Augmented Space Recursion package\nflowchart\n\n12\n\n\fvalue, terminators generated and the L projected density of states are\ncalculated. Each different recursion for each L value is carried out on a\ndifferent processor, thus vastly accelerating the calculations.\nWe then proceed to calculate the total density of states and the Fermi\nenergy. Again, branching out into different processors, we calculate the\nL-dependent moments and magnetic moments. Of all the Modules, this\nis the one amenable to maximum parallelization.\n- At this point we have the possibility of introducing short ranged order.The ASR for short-ranged order has been described in some detail\nearlier [20]. The branching for this choice occurs just before we set up\nthe augmented space Hamiltonian. The extra input is the Warren-Cowley\nshort ranged order parameter.\n- Also at this point we have the option to introducing disorder in the\nstructure matrix because of size mismatch between the two constituents\nof the alloy. The branching now takes place earlier in the Preparation\nModule where we generate not one, but three different structure matrices\nBB\nAB\n: S AA\nij , S ij and S ij . In the 'end point' approximation [21] the Eqn. (12)\nis now replaced by :\n\ne=\nS\n\nXn\nij\n\no\n(1)\n(2)\n\u226a S ij \u226b I + S ij (Ni + Nj ) + S ij Ni \u2297 Nj \u2297 Tij\n\n(14)\n\n\u221a\nBB\nwhere Ni = (y \u2212 x)P\u2193i + xyT\u2191i \u2193i , S (1) = S AB\nand S (2) =\nij \u2212 S ij\nAA\nBB\nAB\nS ij + S ij \u2212 2S ij . This modification will be available in this module.\nIt is in these last two options that the ASR really scores over the CPA,\nwhich cannot really deal with either short-ranged order or off-diagonal disorder as both involve more than one site. The competing methodology is\nthe special quasi-random structures (SQS) [22]. However, if we are dealing\nwith materials with many atoms per unit cell and non-stoichiometric compositions, the SQS required will be rather large and will involve use of huge\nunit cells. Here the TB-LMTO-ASR with the use of much smaller unit\ncells will score. We have shown earlier [23] that both these two methods\ngive virtually the same results for the density of states.\n(v) Module E : In this module the L-dependent moments are used to obtain the charge density. We also calculate the total energy, including the\nMadelung term. For the disordered alloy, the Madelung term is obtained\nfrom the procedure suggested by Skriver and Ruban [24]. Finally the old\nand new moments are mixed, the mixed charge density thus obtained is\ninput back in Module B. This is iterated till convergence in both energy\nand charge density is achieved.\n\n13\n\n\f30\n20\n10\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n1\n\n40\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\n40\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\n40\n\n-0.5\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\n100\n50\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n-0.75\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n-0.75\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\nFigure 3: (Top) DOS for Crx Fe1\u2212x for different compositions : (left) Cr7 Fe3 ;\n(middle) Cr5 Fe5 ; (right) Cr3 Fe7 ; (Bottom) DOS for Cux Zn1\u2212x for different compositions : (left) Cu24 Zn76 ; (middle) Cu50 Zn50 ; (right) Cu75 Zn25 . Energy(Ryd)\nis plotted along x-axis; y-axis is DOS (states/Ryd)\nFor the DFT part, our code depends heavily on Stuttgart-LMTO routines\ndeveloped by Anderson and co-workers [25] Two independent DFT codes run\nparallely to produce the potential parameters of the two constituent atoms of\nthe binary alloy. These potential parameters are used at the input point of our\nASR routines in Module D.\nOur present DFT modules deal only with collinear magnetism. For spin\ndependent calculations the Hamiltonian is separable in spin space. Thus the\nspin is merged with the label L which is now {l, m, \u03c3} and we have just to\ncarry out twice the number of recursions : for \u03c3 =\u2191 and \u2193. In case we wish\nto introduce spin-orbit coupling and possibility of non-collinear magnetism, we\nhave to replace the DFT module with one dealing with density matrices, rather\nthan densities [26] and the ASR module with one applying generalized or vector\nrecursion [12]-[13] which was designed to deal with Hamiltonians whose representation in spin-space or 'spinor' bases is not diagonal :\ne\n\u226b=\n\u226a n|H|m\n\n\u0012\n\nH \u2191\u2191\nnm\nH \u2193\u2191\nnm\n\nH \u2191\u2193\nnm\nH \u2193\u2193\nnm\n14\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\n150\n\n-0.75\n\n10\n0\n\n1\n\n200\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\nDOS(state/atom-ryd)\n\n0.5\n\n20\n\nEnergy(ryd)\n\n200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n30\n\nwhere |n \u226b=\n\n\u0012\n\n|n\u2191i\n|n\u2193i\n\n\u0013\n\n0\n\n\fThis new module is under preparation [27] and will be incorporated once\nthe basic checks are carried out. Here we mention this in order to bring out the\ndifferent possibilities and versatility of the package.\n\n6\n\nApplications and performance analysis\n\nWe have described the contents and commented upon the efficiency and versatility of the TB-LMTO-ASR package. We shall conclude by describing two\ndifferent applications : namely, the alloys Cux Zn1\u2212x where both the constituents\nare non-magnetic in the bulk and the d-band centres of Cu and Zn are well separated; and Fex Cr1\u2212x where both constituents are magnetic and their d-bands\noverlap.\nFor a single self-consistency loop\nOld TB-LMTO-ASR New TB-LMTO-ASR\n699 sec\n225 sec\n\u0011\n\nWall time\u0010\ncputime\nEfficiency walltime\n\n0.714\n\n0.97\n\nThe alloys have been studied earlier by us using the old version of the TBLMTO-ASR [4],[28]-[29] and TB-LMTO-CCPA1 [31], both introduced by us,\nand the KKR-ICPA2 [32] which is also based on the augmented space formalism,\nas well as through the KKR-CPA3 [34], PAW-SQS4 [22] and KKR-NL-CPA5 [35][36]. They are therefore ideal system for benchmarking the new TB-LMTO-ASR\npackage. Comparison of the densities of states shown in Fig. 3 with the results\nshown in the above references will convince us that for Fex Cr1\u2212x there is hardly\nanything to choose between the various techniques and the packages based on\nthem. However, for the split band alloy Cux Zn1\u2212x the TB-LMTO-ASR, TBLMTO-CCPA and KKR-NL-CPA scores over the CPA versions, as expected\nfrom earlier analysis.\nOne of our our main point of interest is the relative runtime and efficiency\nof this new version of the TB-LMTO-ASR, as compared to the several earlier\nversions proposed by us. To benchmark these characteristics we take a specific\ncalculation on Fex Cr1\u2212x .

The discontinuity between the cumulative time of spectral\nand splint is due to the machine routine which are not included here.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have presented here a computational package that combines three different\ntechniques to allow us to study the electronic properties of disordered systems.\nThe package can deal with bulk disordered alloys as well as surfaces and interfaces, both smooth, stepped and rough and also structurally distorted lattices.\nThe package can be generalized at many stages which have been clearly commented upon and the generalizations are being carried out step by step.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
