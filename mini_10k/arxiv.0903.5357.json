We rederive the luminosity function for the sample of DA white dwarfs from the\nKiso Schmidt ultraviolet excess survey (KUV stars) using the spectroscopic method where\nthe atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) and absolute visual magnitudes for each star are\nobtained from detailed model atmosphere fits to optical spectroscopic data. We compare the\nresult of our determination with that obtained by Darling (1994) based on empirical photometric\ncalibrations. Our luminosity function is also compared with that derived spectroscopically from\nthe PG survey. Misclassified objects are also briefly discussed.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Palomar Green (PG) survey has identified 1874 ultraviolet excess objects and it is estimated\nto be 84% complete (Green et al. 1986). The luminosity function of DA white dwarfs from the\nPG survey was determined from photometric calibrations by Fleming et al. (1986) and improved\nby Liebert et al. (2005; hereafter LBH05) using the spectroscopic method for measuring effective\ntemperatures, surface gravitites, and absolute visual magnitudes (see, e.g., Bergeron et al. 1992).\nSimilarly, Darling (1994) derived a luminosity function of all white dwarfs from the Kiso Schmidt\nultraviolet excess survey (KUV) - all spectral types included - using MV values obtained from\nphotometric calibrations. However, the B \u2212 V versus (photographic) color index relation used\nto derive the absolute visual magnitudes showed a considerable dispersion, and it is believed\nthat the estimated MV values probably reflect a similar dispersion (LBH05). LBH05 (see their\nFig. 10) made a detailed comparison of their luminosity function with those of Fleming et\nal. (1986) and Darling (1994). They evaluate the completeness of the PG survey to 75%, while\nDarling (1994) found a lower value of 58%. In this paper, we present preliminary results from\nour study aimed at improving the luminosity function by applying the spectroscopic method to\nthe DA stars in the KUV sample. One of our goals is to improve the comparison of the DA\nluminosity functions derived from the PG and KUV samples.\n2. White Dwarfs from the KUV Survey\nThe Kiso Ultraviolet Excess Survey (KUV) is a photometric search for UV-excess objects,\nperformed with the 105-cm Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory. The 1186 objects were found\nin 44 fields in a belt from the northern to the southern galactic pole at a galactic longitude of\n180 \u25e6 . The fields of the survey have a mean limiting magnitude of 17.7 and cover a total area of\n1400 square degrees (Noguchi et al. 1980, Kondo et al. 1984).\n\n\fWe have secured optical spectroscopic observations for all white dwarfs in the KUV survey.\nSpectra have been obtained with the Steward Observatory 2.3-m telescope equipped with the\nBoller & Chivens spectrograph and a Loral CCD detector. The 4.5 arcsec slit together with the\n600 l/mm grating in first order provided a spectral coverage of \u03bb\u03bb3200\u20135300 at an intermediate\nresolution of \u223c 6 \u00c5 FWHM and a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 50. We have reclassified\nseveral objects (see Table 1): 30 objects from Darling's sample turned out to be main sequence\nor subdwarf stars. Our analysis also includes seven new white dwarfs that have been identified\nin the KUV survey since 1994. Only DA stars are analyzed here, for a total of 172 white dwarfs\n(including the 5 magnetic DAs). Sample spectra are displayed in Figure 1.\nTable 1. Spectroscopic content of the KUV survey.\n\nThis work\nDarling\n\nDA\n\nDB\n\nDQ/DZ/DC\n\nDO\n\nMag DA\n\nTotal\n\n167\n192\n\n23\n25\n\n15\n15\n\n1\n0\n\n5\n2\n\n211\n234\n\nFigure 1. Optical spectra for a subset of DA stars from the KUV sample. The effective\ntemperature decreases from upper left to bottom right.\nWith our sample properly defined, we proceed to measure the atmospheric parameters (Teff\nand log g) of each star using the spectroscopic fitting technique and model atmospheres described\nat length in LBH05 and references therein. Our results for the KUV sample are summarized\nin Figure 2 in a log g vs log Teff diagram. Absolute visual magnitudes are then calculated\nfrom evolutionary models following the prescription of Holberg and Bergeron (2006). Our\nspectroscopic MV values are compared in Figure 3 with those derived by Darling (1994), which\nare based on empirical photometric calibrations. The differences observed are quite significant,\nwith the empirical estimates of Darling being generally fainter than the MV values determined\n\n\fspectroscopically. It is therefore expected that the luminosity function based on these absolute\nmagnitudes will be affected as well.\n\nFigure 2. Teff and log g values for all DA stars from the complete KUV sample. The solid lines\nrepresent carbon-core evolutionary models with thick hydrogen layers (see LBH05 and references\ntherein); numbers on the right hand side of the figure indicate the mass of each model in solar\nmasses.\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of the absolute visual\nmagnitudes obtained from the empirical\nphotometric calibration of Darling (1994) and\nfrom the spectroscopic method.\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of the luminosity\nfunctions of DA stars from the KUV survey\n(this work and Darling 1994) and from the\nPG survey (LBH05).\n\n\f3. The Luminosity Function\nThe luminosity function of white dwarf stars is a measure of the local density of this type of\nobject by interval of absolute magnitude. It contains information about the history of the local\ngalactic disk and stellar evolution. It represents also a direct measure of the space density of\nwhite dwarfs and of the stellar death rate in the local galactic disk. Compared to theoretical\nluminosity functions, it can lead to an estimate of the age of the local galactic disk, as discussed\nin Fontaine et al. (2001) for instance. We derive the luminosity function for the DA stars from\nthe KUV survey by adding the inverse of the contribution of each star to the space density\nfor each magnitude bin, following the well established 1/Vmax method (Schmidt 1968). The\ncompleteness of the sample is evaluated from the hV /Vmax i method described in Green (1980).\nUsing this technique, we obtain a limiting magnitude of 17.31 for our sample of DA stars.\nOur improved luminosity function for the KUV sample based on spectroscopic determinations\nof MV is compared in Figure 4 (filled circles) with the results of Darling (1994) based on empirical\nphotometric calibrations (open circles). Also shown is the luminosity function for the DA stars\nfrom the PG survey derived by LBH05 using the same spectroscopic technique as that used in\nour analysis (filled triangles). Our results for the KUV sample are systematically larger than the\nPG sample in each magnitude bin, which suggests that the KUV survey is more complete than\nthe PG survey. This is particularly true at the faint end of the luminosity function where the PG\nsample is known to be fairly incomplete (LBH05). We note, however, that the differences do not\nappear as large as previously estimated from the comparison with the results of Darling (see also\nLBH05, Fig. 10). Indeed, above MV \u223c 12, our spectroscopic determination of the luminosity\nfunction is systematically lower than that of Darling. This is explained by the fact that a lot\nof the objects in the fainter bins in Darling's analysis have been shifted to brighter magnitude\nbins as a result of his overestimates of the MV values (see Fig. 3). We must also mention that\nbecause of our spectral reclassification (see above), our sample contains fewer DA white dwarfs\nthan the original sample analyzed by Darling. According to Darling, the completeness of the\nPG survey is 58%, while the KUV survey is 75% complete. The total space density of DA\nstars based on our analysis of the KUV sample is 2.10 \u00d7 10\u22123 pc\u22123 . LBH05 obtained for the\nPG survey a value of 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc\u22123 for DA white dwarfs with MV < 12.75. For the same\nrange of MV , we derive a value of 7.58 \u00d7 10\u22124 pc\u22123 , i.e. a space density \u223c 15 times larger. The\nnext step in our analysis will be to include the DB stars observed in our survey to improve our\ndetermination of the complete luminosity function of white dwarf stars.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the director and staff of Steward Observatory for the use of their facilities.\nThis work was supported in part by the NSERC Canada and by the Fund FQRNT (Qu\u00e9bec).\nP.B. is a Cottrell Scholar of the Research Corporation for Science Advancement.\n4.
