This core field, evidenced and characterized using ab\ninitio calculations, corresponds to a biaxial dilatation, which we modeled within the anisotropic\nlinear elasticity. We show that this core field needs to be considered when extracting quantitative\ninformation from atomistic simulations, such as dislocation core energies. Finally, we look at how\ndislocation properties are modified by this core field, by studying the interaction between two\ndislocations composing a dipole, as well as the interaction of a screw dislocation with a carbon\natom.\nPACS numbers: 61.72.Lk, 61.72.Bb\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAb initio calculations have revealed that a h111i screw\ndislocation in \u03b1-iron creates a core field in addition to\nthe Volterra elastic field1 . This core field corresponds to\na pure dilatation in the {111} plane perpendicular to the\ndislocation line. It is responsible for a non negligible volume change per unit length of dislocation line. The core\nfield decays more rapidly than the Volterra field, as the\ndisplacement created by this core field varies as the inverse of the distance to the dislocation line, whereas the\ndisplacement caused by the Volterra field varies as the\nlogarithm of this distance. Such a dislocation core field\nis not specific to iron: a similar dilatation induced by the\ncore of the screw dislocation can be deduced from the\nanalysis of core structures obtained from first-principles\nin other body-centered cubic (bcc) metals, such as Mo\nand Ta2,3 . Atomistic simulations in other crystal structures have also led to such a core field4\u20138 .\nThe purpose of this paper is to characterize this core\nfield for a h111i screw dislocation in iron, and to see how\nit modifies the dislocation properties. In that purpose,\nab initio calculations have been used to obtain the dislocation core structure. Then the dislocation core field has\nbeen modeled within the linear anisotropic elasticity theory, using the approach initially developed by Hirth and\nLothe9 , and generalized in the preceding paper10 to incorporate the core field contribution into the dislocation\nelastic energy. This modeling allows extracting quantitative information from ab initio calculations, such as the\ndislocation core energy. Finally, the effect of the core field\non the interaction of a screw dislocation with a carbon\natom has been investigated, as well as on the properties\nof a screw dislocation dipole.\n\nII.\n\nATOMISTIC SIMULATIONS\nA.\n\nDislocation dipole\n\nFully periodic boundary conditions have been selected\nto study the h111i screw dislocation in \u03b1-Fe.

Screw dislocation periodic arrangements used for ab\ninitio calculations: (a) T and (b) AT triangular arrangements,\n(c) quadrupolar arrangement. u and v are the unit cell periodicity vectors, and A the dipole cut vector. In all cases,\nthe Burgers vector b = 12 a0 [111] for easy, and \u2212 12 a0 [111] for\nhard core configuration.\n\ncation dipole is introduced into the simulation box, using three different periodic distributions of dislocations.\nWithin the triangular arrangement, initially proposed\nby Frederiksen and Jacobsen3 , the dislocations are positioned on a honeycomb network [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]\nthat strictly preserves the threefold symmetry of the bcc\nlattice along the [111] direction. Two different variants,\nwhich are linked by a \u03c0/3 rotation, are possible for this\nperiodic arrangement: the twinning (T) [Fig. 1(a)] and\nthe anti-twinning (AT) [Fig. 1(b)] triangular arrangement. The name of the variant refers to the fact that\nthe dislocation dipole has been created by shearing a\n{112} plane either in the T or AT orientation. The third\nperiodic arrangement, represented in Fig. 1(c), is equivalent to a rectangular array of quadrupoles. The periodicity vectors u and v defining these different arrangements are given in Ref. 11. For all periodic arrangements,\nthe periodicity vector along the dislocation line is taken\nas the minimal allowed vector, i.e. the Burgers vector\nb = 21 a0 [111] where a0 is the lattice parameter. Thus\nthe number of atoms in the simulation box is directly\nproportional to the surface S of the unit cell perpendicular to the dislocation line.\nFor each periodic arrangement, the dislocations are positioned at the center of gravity of three neighboring [111]\natomic columns. Depending on the sign of the Burgers\n\n\f2\nvector, two types of cores can be obtained12 . In the easy\ncore configuration, the helicity of the lattice is locally\nreversed compared to the helicity of the perfect lattice.\nThis configuration has been found to be the most stable\nin all atomistic simulations in bcc transition metals. In\nthe hard core configuration, the three central neighboring [111] atomic columns are shifted locally so that these\natoms lie in the same (111) plane. This configuration\nactually corresponds to a local maximum of the energy\nof the dislocation arrangement. It can be nevertheless\nstabilized numerically by symmetry in the atomistic simulations. The three periodic arrangements sketched in\nFig. 1 allow us to simulate a dipole whose both dislocations are either in their easy or hard core configuration11.\nThe dislocation dipole is introduced into the simulation\ncell by applying the displacement field of each dislocation,\nas given by the anisotropic linear elasticity. A homogeneous strain is also applied to the periodicity vectors, to\nminimize the elastic energy contained within the simulation box1,13\u201316 . This homogeneous strain corresponds to\nthe plastic strain produced when the dislocation dipole\nis introduced into the simulation unit cell. It is given by\n\u03b50ij = \u2212\n\nbi Aj + bj Ai\n.\n2S\n\nThe orientations of the Burgers vector, b, and of the\ndipole cut vector, A, are defined in Fig. 1. Then\nthe atomic positions are relaxed so as to minimize the\nenergy of the simulation box computed by ab initio\ncalculations11 .\nTwo types of simulations have been performed in this\nwork: simulations at constant volume and at zero stress.\nOne can keep the periodicity vectors fixed and minimize\nthe energy only with respect to the atomic positions.\nWithin this constant volume simulation, the simulation\nbox is subject to a homogeneous stress. Within the zero\nstress simulation, the unit cell is allowed to relax its size\nand shape, so that the homogeneous stress vanishes at\nthe end of the relaxation. In both cases, the dislocation\ncore field can be identified.\n\nB.\n\nAb initio calculations\n\nThe present ab initio calculations in bcc iron have\nbeen performed in the density functional theory (DFT)\nframework using the Siesta code17 , i.e. the pseudopotential approximation and localized basis sets, as in\nRefs. 18 and 11. Comparison with plane-waves DFT\ncalculations19 has shown that this Siesta approach is\nreliable to study dislocations in bcc iron. The charge density is represented on a real space grid with a grid spacing\nof 0.06 \u00c5 that has been reduced after self-consistency to\n0.03 \u00c5. The Hermite-Gaussian smearing technique with\na 0.3 eV width has been used for electronic density of\nstate broadening. These calculations are spin-polarized\nand eight valence electrons are considered for iron. The\n\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme is used for exchange and correlation. A 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 16 k-point grid is used for the dislocation calculations with unit cells containing up to 361\natoms, and a 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 grid for the elastic constants.\nThe obtained Fe lattice parameter is a0 = 2.88 \u00c5, in\ngood agreement with the experimental value (2.85 \u00c5).\nThe DFT elastic constants are deduced from a fit on\na fourth order polynomial over the energies for different strains ranging from \u22122 to 2 %. This leads to the\nvalues of 248, 146 and 69 GPa for the elastic constants\nC11 , C12 and C44 respectively, expressed in Voigt notation in the cubic axes. These values are close to the\nexperimental ones, C11 = 243 and C12 = 145 GPa, except for the shear modulus C44 which is found stiffer\nexperimentally (116 GPa). As a consequence, the elastic\nanisotropy within DFT is less pronounced than experimentally: DFT calculations lead to an anisotropic ratio\nA = 2C44 /(C11 \u2212 C12 ) = 1.35 instead of 2.36.\nThe three ab initio elastic constants yield to a shear\nmodulus in {110} planes \u03bc110 = (C11 \u2212 C12 + C44 ) /3\nequal to 57 GPa, which is close to the experimental value,\n\u03bc110 = 71 GPa. This parameter is of major importance\nfor h111i dislocations as it controls their glide in {110}\nplanes. Another important quantity is the logarithmic\nprefactor K = \u03bcb2 /4\u03c0 controlling the main contribution\nto dislocation elastic energy. For a screw h111i dislocation, the shear modulus appearing in this prefactor is\nequal to 56 GPa for ab initio data and 64 GPa for experimental ones, thus in close agreement. The error between\nab initio and experimental elastic constants should therefore not affect too much our results. For consistency, all\nelastic calculations below are performed using ab initio\nelastic constants.\n\nIII.\n\nCORE FIELD CHARACTERIZATION\n\nThe dislocation core field can be modeled by an equilibrium distribution of line forces20 parallel to the dislocation and located close to its core4,9 . For the h111i\nscrew dislocation in iron, the center of this distribution\ncorresponds exactly to the position of the dislocation, i.e.\nto the center of gravity of three h111i neighboring atomic\ncolumns, for symmetry reasons. At long range, and at a\npoint defined by its cylindrical coordinates, r and \u03b8, this\ndistribution generates an elastic displacement given by a\nLaurent series (see preceding paper10 )\nu(r, \u03b8) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=1\n\nun\n\n1\n.\nrn\n\nThe main contribution of this series, i.e. the term n = 1,\nis completely controlled by the first moments Mij of the\nline force distribution. Knowing this second rank tensor\nMij , one can not only predict the elastic displacement\nand stress associated with the core field9 , but also the\ncontribution of the core field to the elastic energy and to\n\n\f3\n\n0\n\n600\n\n2\n\nM (GPa \u00c5 )\n\nStress (GPa)\n\n-1\n-2\n(a) T and AT triangular arrangements\n\u03c3xx\n\u03c3yy\n\u03c3zz\n\u03c3yz\n\u03c3xz\n\u03c3xy\n\n-3\n-4\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNumber of atoms\n\n300\n\n400\n\n(a) Easy core configuration\nT triangular: Mxx = Myy\nAT triangular: Mxx = Myy\nQuadrupolar: Mxx\nMyy\n\n200\n\n0\n400\n\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNumber of atoms\n\n300\n\n400\n\n600\n\n2\n\nM (GPa \u00c5 )\n\nStress (GPa)\n\n-1\n-2\n(b) Quadrupolar arrangement\n\u03c3xx\n\u03c3yy\n\u03c3zz\n\u03c3yz\n\u03c3xz\n\u03c3xy\n\n-3\n-4\n0\n\n100\n200\nNumber of atoms\n\n(b) Hard core configuration\nT triangular: Mxx = Myy\nAT triangular: Mxx = Myy\nQuadrupolar: Mxx\nMyy\n\n200\n\n0\n300\n\nFIG. 2.

The six\ncomponents of the corresponding stress tensor are shown\nin Fig. 2 for the three periodic dislocation arrangements,\nin the easy core configuration. The stress components\nare expressed in the axes ex = [1\u03041\u03042], ey = [11\u03040] and\nez = [111]. The main components of the stress tensor\nare \u03c3xx and \u03c3yy , and the other components can be neglected. The stress components \u03c3xx and \u03c3yy vary roughly\nlinearly with the inverse of the number of atoms, and so\nwith the inverse of the surface S of the simulation box.\nFor the two variants of the triangular arrangement, T and\nAT, the stress components \u03c3xx and \u03c3yy are exactly equal\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNumber of atoms\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFIG. 3. Moments Mxx and Myy of the line force dipoles for\nthe three periodic dislocation arrangements in the (a) easy\nand (b) hard core configuration.\n\n[Fig. 2(a)]. Indeed, the threefold symmetry along the\n[111] direction obeyed by this dislocation arrangement is\nalso imposed to the homogeneous stress. On the other\nhand, the quadrupolar arrangement breaks this symmetry. As a consequence, \u03c3xx and \u03c3yy slightly differ from\neach other in this case [Fig. 2(b)].\nThe two core fields of the dislocations composing the\ndipole are responsible for this homogeneous stress, as\nshown in Ref. 1. If Mij is the first moment tensor of\nthe line force distribution representative of the core field,\nthe homogeneous stress in the simulation box is given by1\n\u03c3ij = \u22122\n\nMij\n.\nS\n\n(1)\n\nThe factor of 2 in this equation arises from the fact that\ntwo dislocations constituting the dipole are introduced\nwithin the simulation box.\nAs the stress components other than \u03c3xx and \u03c3yy\ncan be neglected, the force moment tensor M will have\nonly two non-zero components, Mxx and Myy , as shown\nin Eq. (1). These two components deduced from the\nstress computed from DFT calculations are represented\nin Fig. 3(a) for the easy core configuration, and in\n\n\f4\nFig. 3(b) for the hard core configuration. Within the\ntwo triangular arrangements, the core field is a pure biaxial dilatation (Mxx = Myy ), whereas the core field has\na small distortion component (Mxx \u2212 Myy 6= 0) within\nthe quadrupolar arrangement. This distortion is associated with the broken threefold symmetry within the\nquadrupolar periodic arrangement. It may arise from a\npolarizability21\u201323 of the core field: the moments M characterizing the core field may depend on the stress applied\nto the dislocation core. Such a polarizability may also be\nthe reason why the moments obtained within the T variant of the triangular arrangement slightly differ from the\nmoments obtained within the AT variant (Fig. 3).\n\nsix components of the homogeneous strain are given by\n\u2032\n\n\u03b50xx =\n\nC33\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nC33 (C11 + C12 ) \u2212 2C13\n\u2032\n\n+\n\nC44\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nC44 (C11 \u2212 C12 ) \u2212 2C15\n\u2032\n\n\u03b50yy =\n\nC33\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nC33 (C11 + C12 ) \u2212 2C13\n\u2032\n\n\u2212\n\nC44\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nC44 (C11 \u2212 C12 ) \u2212 2C15\n\nMxx + Myy\nS\nMxx \u2212 Myy\n,\nS\nMxx + Myy\nS\nMxx \u2212 Myy\n,\nS\n\n\u2032\n\nOne can also observe a dependence of the moments\nwith the size of the simulation box. The cell size that\ncan be reached in DFT does not allow us to obtain wellconverged values for the moments. Nevertheless, the core\nfield of the screw dislocation in iron can be considered as\na pure biaxial dilatation of amplitude Mxx = Myy =\n650 \u00b1 50 GPa \u00c52 . Interestingly, the easy and the hard\ncore configurations are characterized by the same moments [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], although the atomic structures of the dislocation cores are completely different between these two configurations. This probably indicates\nthat the dislocation core field does not arise from perturbations due to the atomic nature of the core, but rather\nfrom the anharmonicity of the elastic behavior.\n\nB.\n\nSimulations with relaxed periodicity vectors\n\n\u03b50zz = \u2212\n\n2C13\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nC33 (C11 + C12 ) \u2212 2C13\n\nMxx + Myy\n,\nS\n\n\u03b50yz = 0,\n\u2032\n\n\u03b50xz = \u2212\n\u03b50xy\n\nC15\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nC44 (C11 \u2212 C12 ) \u2212 2C15\n\n= 0,\n\nMxx \u2212 Myy\n,\nS\n(2)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere the elastic constants Cnm are expressed in Voigt\nnotation, in the axes ex = [1\u03041\u03042], ey = [11\u03040], and\nez = [111]. This shows that, for positive moments Mxx\nand Myy , a dilatation perpendicular to the dislocation\nand a contraction parallel to the dislocation line are produced. This exactly corresponds to what we observe in\nthe ab initio calculations. Thus one can define a dislocation formation volume perpendicular to the dislocation\nline, \u03b4V\u22a5 = (\u03b50xx +\u03b50yy )S/2 and a formation volume parallel to the dislocation line, \u03b4Vk = \u03b50zz S/2, where the values\nof the formation volume are defined per unit of dislocation line. The DFT results are given in Table I. The\nexpressions of the homogeneous strain [Eq. (2)] also lead\nto a ratio between the two dislocation formation volumes\ndepending only on the elastic constants as\n\u2032\n\nAb initio simulations, in which the periodicity vectors\nare allowed to relax so as to minimize the energy, have\nalso been performed. In this case, a homogeneous strain,\n\u03b50ij , can be computed. This strain is related to the core\nfield of the two dislocations within the simulation box,\nthrough the relation1\n\n\u03b50ij = 2Sijkl\n\nMkl\n,\nS\n\nwhere the elastic compliances Sijkl are the inverse of the\nelastic constants24 .

We choose to derive Mxx and Myy from the components \u03b5xx and \u03b5yy of the strain, and the resulting values\nare given in Table I for the three arrangements. These\nvalues are in good agreement with those derived from\natomistic simulations with fixed periodicity vectors (Sec.\nIII A). For all periodic arrangements of dislocations, the\ndislocation core field can be considered as a pure biaxial dilatation, and we neglect the difference between Mxx\nand Myy .\n\n\f5\nTABLE I.

Then we show that the dislocation core energies can be extracted from these calculations when the\ncore field contribution is considered in the elastic energy.\n\nA.\n\nDislocation core energy\n\n2\n\nAtomic displacement\n\nRelaxation of atomic positions in ab initio calculations\nleads to the definition of atomic displacements induced\nby the periodic array of dislocation dipole. The displacement along the [111] direction, i.e. along the dislocation\nline, also called the screw component, is very close to the\nanisotropic elastic solution corresponding to the Volterra\nfield. There is no substantial contribution of the core\nfield on this displacement component.\nA displacement perpendicular to the dislocation line\ncan also be evidenced in atomistic simulations, i.e. an\nedge component (Fig. 4). Part of this displacement component corresponds to the dislocation Volterra field and\narises from elastic anisotropy. The dislocation core field\nalso contributes to the edge component. The Volterra\ncontribution is more long-ranged than the core field contribution, as the former varies with the logarithm of the\ndistance to the dislocation, whereas the latter varies with\nthe inverse of this distance. Nevertheless, both contributions evidence a similar amplitude in the simulations,\n\nThe screw dislocation core energy is deduced from\nDFT simulations by subtracting the elastic energy to the\nexcess energy of the unit cell computed by ab initio techniques. The elastic energy is calculated by taking into\naccount the elastic anisotropy and the periodic boundary conditions15 .\nIf only the Volterra contribution is considered in the\nelastic energy, the resulting core energies strongly depend\non the periodic arrangement (Fig. 5). As shown in Ref. 1,\none can not conclude on the relative stability of the two\ndifferent core configurations of the screw dislocation. The\nAT triangular geometry and the quadrupolar geometry\npredict that the easy core is the most stable configuration, whereas the T triangular arrangement leads to the\nopposite conclusion. Then if both the Volterra and the\ncore fields are considered in the elastic energy, the core\nenergies do not depend anymore on the periodic arrangement. A cell size dependence has been evidenced (Fig. 5),\nand in all geometries the easy core is more stable than the\nhard core configuration. The convergence is reached for\na reasonable number of atoms: E core = 219 \u00b1 1 meV \u00c5\u22121\nfor the easy core configuration, and 227 \u00b1 1 meV \u00c5\u22121 for\nthe hard core configuration. These core energies are given\nfor a core radius rc = 3 \u00c5, as this value of rc has been\nfound to lead to a reasonable convergence of the core\nenergy with respect to the cell size (cf. Appendix A).\nTo better understand how the core energy converges,\none can decompose the elastic energy into the different contributions, and look how these contributions vary\nwith the length scale. If one neglects the dislocation core\nfield, the elastic energy of the simulation box containing\na dislocation dipole is given by\nelas\n0\ninter\nEV\n= 2Ecelas + bi Kij\nbj ln (A/rc ) + EV\u2212V\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K 0 is a second rank tensor, which depends only on\nthe elastic constants, and rc is the dislocation core cutoff.\nThe two first terms on the right hand side define the\nelastic energy of the dipole contained in the simulation\nbox: Ecelas is the core traction contribution25 , and the\ninter\nsecond term corresponds to the cut contribution.

EV\u2212c\ninter\nand Ec\u2212c correspond to the interaction of the dislocation core field with respectively the Volterra field, and the\ncore field of the other dislocations, i.e. the second dislocation composing the dipole, as well as the image dislocations due to the periodic boundary conditions. When\nthe periodicity vectors, u and v, and the dipole cut, A,\ninter\nare scaled by the same factor \u03bb, EV\u2212c\nvaries as 1/\u03bb, and\ninter\n2\nEc\u2212c , as 1/\u03bb . The number N of atoms in the simulation box is proportional to \u03bb2 . The comparison of\nequations (3) and (4) shows then that the neglect of the\n\ncore field leads to a core energy that converges as N \u22121/2 .\nIn the case of dislocation periodic arrangements, which\nare centrosymmetric like the quadrupolar arrangement of\ninter\nFig. 1(c), EV\u2212c\nvanishes in Eq. (4). The core energy converges thus as N \u22121 when the core field is neglected. In\nall cases, this convergence is too slow to extract a meaningful core energy from ab initio calculations. Moreover,\nthe obtained value does not really correspond to the core\nenergy E core : it results from the summation of E core and\n2\nMkl 1/rc 2 .\nthe core field self elastic energy, Mij Kijkl\nAnother interesting feature comes from the linear deinter\npendency of EV\u2212c\nwith the Burgers vector. Going from\nthe easy to the hard core configuration of the dislocation\ndipole, i.e. inverting the sign of the Burgers vector, one\ninter\nonly changes the sign of EV\u2212c\n, whereas all other contributions to the elastic energy remain constant. The\neasy and the hard core configurations have indeed a core\nfield with the same amplitude (Fig. 3). The contribuinter\ntion EV\u2212c\nis positive for a dislocation dipole in its easy\ncore configuration within the T triangular arrangement\n[Fig. 1(a)]. Therefore, when the core field contribution is\nnot included into the elastic energy, one underestimates\nthe stability of the easy core configuration with respect\nto the hard core configuration within this geometry. The\nAT triangular arrangement leads to the opposite concluinter\nsion [Fig. 1(b)], since EV\u2212c\nbecomes negative for the easy\ncore configuration.\nThe underestimation or overestimation of the stability\nof the easy core illustrates the importance of considering the dislocation core field in the elastic energy, when\nextracting quantitative properties from atomistic simulations. This is especially true for ab initio calculations,\nin which the small cell size makes it difficult to obtain\nconverged values. Such a conclusion is not restricted to\nthe calculation of dislocation core energies. For instance,\nextraction from atomistic simulations of the Peierls energy barriers, and of the associated Peierls stresses, will\nalso require the complete modeling of the dislocation core\nfield.\nC.\n\nDislocation line energy and line tension\n\nIt is interesting to evaluate the different contributions\nto the dislocation line energy. Using the developed elastic model, the energy26 of a straight screw dislocation\ncontained in a cylinder of radius R\u221e is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nR\u221e\n0\nE = E core + Ecelas + bi Kij\nbj ln\n2\nrc\n1\n1\n2\nMkl 2 .

In view of the values obtained,\nit looks reasonable to neglect other elastic contributions,\nas usually done in line tension models27 . Nevertheless,\nsome other studies have obtained higher relative contributions of the core field4,5 , which may therefore have a\nmore important effect on the line tension.\n\n(b)\n4\n\nT(\u03b8) (eV \u00c5 )\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nE(\u03b8) (eV \u00c5 )\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\nbi Kij bj\n\n/ 2 ln(R\u221e/rc)\nelas\nEc\n2\n2\nMij Kijkl Mkl / 2 1/rc\n\n2\n\nV.\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\u221290\n\n3\n\n0\n\u03b8o\n\n90\n\n\u221290\n\n0\n\u03b8o\n\n90\n\nFIG. 6.

(5), is equal to 1.60 eV \u00c5\u22121 ,\nwhere we have assumed the ratio R\u221e /rc = 104 , which\ncorresponds to a characteristic dislocation density of\n1011 m\u22122 . Finally, the core field contribution to the elastic energy, which corresponds to the last term in Eq. (5),\nis equal to 42 meV \u00c5\u22121 . It is clear that most of the dislocation energy arises from the Volterra elastic field, and\nis associated with the cut contribution. Other contributions, which are all associated with the dislocation core,\naccount for about 14 % of the dislocation energy. In particular, the contribution of the core field is less than 3 %.\nThe dislocation line tension is actually more important\nthan the line energy as it controls the shape of dislocation\nloops and curved dislocations27 . It is defined as\nT (\u03b8) = E(\u03b8) +\n\nd2 E(\u03b8)\n,\nd\u03b82\n\nif E(\u03b8) is the dislocation line energy [Eq. (5)] written\nas a function of the dislocation character \u03b8, i.e. the dislocation orientation. We can evaluate this line tension\nby considering all elastic contributions entering in the\ndislocation line energy and neglecting the dependence\nof the dislocation core energy with \u03b8 which we do not\nknow. For the dislocation core field, we assume that the\ndipole tensor Mij does not depend on the dislocation\norientation as we do not have any information on such\na variation: the variation with the dislocation orientation of the associated line energy only arises from elastic\nanisotropy. The different elastic contributions to the dislocation line energy E(\u03b8) and the associated line tension\nT (\u03b8) are shown in Fig. 6 for a dislocation character going\nfrom an edge orientation (\u03b8 = \u00b190\u25e6 ) to a screw orientation (\u03b8 = 0). The most important contribution to the line\ntension arises, once again, from the cut contribution of\n\nDISLOCATION INTERACTION WITH A\nCARBON ATOM\n\nWe examine in this part how the dislocation core\nfield influences the dislocation properties by modifying\nthe way a dislocation can interact with its environment.\nFirst, we study the interaction between a h111i screw\ndislocation and a carbon atom in \u03b1-iron.\nIn Ref. 28, the binding energy between a carbon atom\nand a screw dislocation in iron as predicted by the linear\nanisotropic elasticity has been compared to the one calculated by atomistic simulations based on an empirical\npotential approach29 . A quantitative agreement between\nboth modeling techniques was obtained as long as the C\natom was located at a distance greater than 2 \u00c5 from the\ndislocation core. This result evidences the ability of linear elasticity to predict this interaction. The empirical\npotential for iron30,31 used in Ref. 28 does not lead to\nany core field for the screw dislocation, at variance with\nthe present ab initio results. It is interesting to include\nnow the core field contribution into the elastic field of\nthe screw dislocation, to investigate its influence on the\ninteraction between a carbon atom and a screw dislocation. Such a contribution to the interaction energy between a solute atom and a dislocation has already been\nconsidered in the case of a substitutional impurity by\nFleischer32 who showed that it partly contributes to the\nsolid solution hardening.\n\nA.\n\nCarbon atom description\n\nFirst we need to deduce from ab initio calculations a\nquantitative representation of a carbon atom embedded\nin an iron matrix. A solute atom is modeled in elasticity\ntheory by its dipolar tensor, Pij , which corresponds to the\nfirst moments of the equilibrated point force distribution\nequivalent to the impurity. This tensor is deduced from\natomistic simulations of one solute atom embedded in the\nsolvent (cf. Appendix B).\nCarbon atoms are found in the octahedral interstitial\nsites of the bcc lattice. The dipolar tensor, Pij , expressed\nin the cubic axes, is diagonal with only two independent\ncomponents, because of the tetragonal symmetry of the\noctahedral site. Three variants can be obtained, depending on the orientation of the tetragonal symmetry axis.\nFor the [001] variant of the C atom, ab initio calculations\nlead to Pxx = Pyy = 8.9 and Pzz = 17.5 eV (cf.

Binding energy between a 1/2[111](11\u03040) screw dislocation and a carbon atom for different positions x of the\ndislocation in its (11\u03040) glide plane. The C atom lies in a [100]\noctahedral site in the plane h = d110 \u2248 2.04 \u00c5 above the glide\nplane.

We consider that the core field is created by the\nline force moments Mxx = Myy = 650 GPa \u00c52 previously\ndeduced. In Fig. 7, we represent the variation of the\nbinding energy when the dislocation glides in a {110}\nplane, while the carbon atom remains at a fixed distance\nh from the glide plane. The first derivative of the plotted\nfunction gives the force exerted by the C atom on the\ngliding dislocation. When the C atom is close enough\nto the dislocation, the core field modifies the binding energy. In particular, the binding of the C atom is stronger\nin the attractive region when the dislocation core field is\nconsidered. Thus the pinning of the screw dislocation by\nthe C atom is enhanced by its core field. Conversely, the\ndislocation core field leads to a stronger repulsion in the\nrepulsive region.\nWhen the separation distance between the C atom and\nthe screw dislocation is high enough (& 20 \u00c5), the dislocation core field does not affect anymore the binding\nenergy. One can consider that the C atom interacts only\nwith the dislocation Volterra field.\n\n\u22122\n\nLinear elasticity theory predicts that the binding energy between the carbon atom characterized by its dipolar tensor, Pij , and the screw dislocation is given by\n\nFx (eV \u00c5 )\n\nB.\n\n0.01\n0\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.02\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\nx (\u00c5)\n\n10\n\n20\n\nFIG. 9. Variation of the elastic energy, \u2206E, and of the x\ncomponent of the force F acting on the dislocations, Fx , with\nthe distance between both dislocations, x, for a screw dipole\nof height h = 10 \u00c5.\n\nVI.\n\nPASSING PROPERTIES OF A SCREW\nDISLOCATION DIPOLE\n\nWe look in this part at how the dislocation core field\nmodifies the equilibrium properties of a screw dislocation\ndipole. Dislocation dipoles play a significant role in single\nslip straining, where they can control the material flow\nstress. Such a situation arises for instance in fatigued\nmetals, where dislocations are constrained to glide in the\nchannels between dislocation walls33,34 . The saturation\nstress of the persistent slip bands is then partly controlled\nby the critical stress needed to destroy the dislocation\ndipoles.\nWe consider a screw dislocation dipole in bcc iron. The\n\n\f10\n10\n\nVolterra only\nVolterra and core field\n\n\u03c3yz (GPa)\n\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n3\u03c0/8\n\n\u03b8max\n\ndipole is characterized by the height between each dislocation glide plane, h, and by the projection of the dipole\nvector on the glide plane, x, as sketched in Fig. 8. Then\nwe calculate the variation of the interaction energy between the two dislocations composing the dipole, \u2206E,\nwhen dislocations glide, i.e. h is kept fixed while x varies.\nThis dislocation interaction energy is computed using\nthe linear anisotropic elasticity10 , and considering that\nthe two dislocations composing the dipole interact only\nthrough the Volterra field, or through both the Volterra\nand the core fields. This variation of energy, \u2206E, is represented in Fig. 9 for a dipole height h = 10 \u00c5. The dipole\nequilibrium angle corresponds to the minimum of \u2206E,\ni.e. \u03b8 = 0. This value predicted by the anisotropic elasticity is equal to the one given by the isotropic elasticity.\nThis contrasts with what is found in fcc metals, where\nthe dipole equilibrium angle strongly depends on elastic\nanisotropy for a screw dislocation dipole35 . The dislocation core field does not modify the dipole equilibrium\nangle (Fig. 9). Nevertheless, when both the Volterra and\nthe core fields are included into the computation of the\ndipole elastic energy, the energy that defines the dipole\nequilibrium becomes steeper than when the dislocation\ncore field is omitted. Thus the attraction between both\ndislocations is stronger when the core field is taken into\naccount. This is obvious when looking at the glide component of the force exerted by one dislocation on the\nother one, Fx (Fig. 9). This force is the first derivative of\n\u2206E with respect to x. When the dislocation core field is\nincluded in the dislocation interaction, this force goes to a\nhigher maximum value than when only the Volterra elastic field is considered. To destroy the dislocation dipole,\none needs to exert on a dislocation a force that is higher\nthan the force arising from the interaction with the other\ndislocation. This shows that the dislocation core field\nleads to a more stable dipole.\nIf a homogeneous stress is applied, the gliding force on\neach dislocation is simply the Peach-Koehler force, b\u03c3yz .\nAs the applied stress is homogeneous, no force originates\nfrom the dislocation core field10 . Therefore the dipole\npassing stress, i.e. the applied stress needed to destroy\nthe dislocation dipole, is given by the maximum of the\nglide component Fx of the Peach-Koehler force divided\nby the norm of the Burgers vector. This passing stress\ndepends on the dipole height, h, as shown in Fig. 10. The\ninclusion of the core field into the dislocation interaction\nleads to a higher passing stress, especially for small dipole\nheights. But the effect is relevant at a spacing where the\ndipole would certainly have cross-slipped to annihilation.\nFor large dipole heights (h \u2265 20 \u00c5), the dislocation core\nfield does not influence too much the passing stress, and\none can consider that dislocations interact only through\nthe Volterra elastic field to calculate the passing stress.\nWithout the dislocation core field, the dipole passing angle, \u03b8max , does not depend on the dipole height\n(Fig. 10). The value given by the anisotropic elasticity is\nclose to the \u03c0/4 value predicted by the isotropic elasticity.\nThe core field leads to a passing angle, which depends on\n\n\u03c0/4\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nh (\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 10. Variation of the passing stress, \u03c3yz , and of the passing angle, \u03b8max , with the dislocation dipole height, h.\n\nthe dipole height, and which strongly deviates from \u03c0/4\nfor small dipole heights. Such a dependence of the passing angle with the dipole height has also been obtained by\nHenager and Hoagland for edge dislocation dipoles in fcc\nmetals7,8 . They obtained a stronger influence of the core\nfield on the dislocation interaction than in the present\nstudy. In their case, the core field contribution can be\nneglected only when the two dislocations are separated\nby more than 50b, i.e. more than 10 nm.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe approach developed in the preceding paper to\nmodel dislocation core field10 , has been applied here to\nthe h111i screw dislocation in \u03b1-iron. Using ab initio calculations, we have shown that a screw dislocation creates\na core field corresponding to a dilatation perpendicular\nto the dislocation line. The core field modeling within\nthe anisotropic linear elasticity perfectly reproduces the\natomic displacements observed in ab initio calculations.\nIt also allows to derive from atomistic simulations converged values of the dislocation core energies. The developed approach illustrates the necessity to consider the\ndislocation core field when extracting quantitative information from atomistic simulations of dislocations.\nThen the elastic modeling of the screw dislocation has\nbeen used to study the interaction energy between the\ndislocation and a carbon atom. The dislocation core field\nincreases the binding of the C atom when both defects\n\n\f11\n\nT triangular\nAT triangular\nQuadrupolar\n\n\u22121\n\n(meV \u00c5 )\n\n470\n\ncore\n\n465\n\nE\n\n(a) rc = 10 \u00c5\n460\nT triangular\nAT triangular\nQuadrupolar\n\n\u22121\n\n(meV \u00c5 )\n\n240\n\ncore\n\n230\n\nE\n\n(b) rc = 3 \u00c5\n220\nT triangular\nAT triangular\nQuadrupolar\n\n\u22121\n\n(meV \u00c5 )\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u2212200\n\ncore\n\nE\n\nare close enough (less than \u223c20 \u00c5). At larger separation\ndistances, the C atom interacts only with the dislocation\nVolterra elastic field.\nEquilibrium properties of a screw dislocation dipole\nare also affected by the dislocation core field. This additional elastic field increases the stability of the dipole: a\nhigher stress is needed to destroy the dipole. Nevertheless, when the two dislocations composing the dipole are\nsufficiently separated, one can consider that they only\ninteract through their Volterra field.\nThe amplitude of the dilatation corresponding to the\ndislocation core field does not depend on the dislocation\ncore configuration, i.e. either easy or hard core structure.\nThis indicates that the core field does not arise from\nthe atomic structure of the dislocation core, but may\nbe induced by anharmonicity. Our work, like previous\nsimilar studies4,5,7\u20139,36 , shows that such an anharmonic\neffect can be fully considered within linear elasticity theory with the help of a localized core field. One could\nhave also used non-linear elasticity theory to incorporate\nanharmonic contributions, either following the approach\nof Seeger and Haasen37 based on a Gr\u00fcneisen model for\nan isotropic crystal, or the iterative scheme proposed by\nWillis38,39 for an anisotropic crystal.\n\n(c) rc = 1 \u00c5\n\u2212300\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by EFDA MAT-REMEV\nprogramme, by the SIMDIM project under contract No.\nANR-06-BLAN-250, and by the European Commission\nin the framework of the PERFORM60 project under the\ngrant agreement number 232612 in FP7/2007-2011.

This core radius defines the cylindrical region\naround the dislocation line, where the strain is so high\nthat elasticity theory does not apply. It therefore partitions the dislocation excess energy into two contributions,\nthe core energy corresponding to the energy stored in\nthis core cylinder and the elastic energy in the remaining\nspace. Changing the value of rc modifies this partition\nbetween core and elastic energy without modifying the\ntotal excess energy [Eq. (5)]. In the present work, the\nchoice of rc affects the convergence of the core energy\nwith the size of the simulation box and the geometry of\nthe dislocation periodic array. This arises from the dislocation core field. The dislocation line energy created\nby this core field depends on rc through the contribution\n1/2 Mij Kijkl Mkl 1/rc 2 [Eq. (5)]. As the dipole moments\nMij have been found to depend on the size of the simulation cell (Fig. 3), changing the value of rc leads to a\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\nNumber of atoms\n\n300\n\n400\n\nFIG. 11. Core energy of the screw dislocation in the easy\ncore configuration for different core radii: (a) rc = 10 \u00c5, (b)\nrc = 3 \u00c5, and (c) rc = 1 \u00c5. Both the Volterra and the core\nfields have been considered in the elastic energy.\n\nshift of the core energy which also depends on this size.\nFigure 11 shows the core energies obtained for different\ncore radii. One sees that the value rc = 3 \u00c5 leads to a\ncore energy which does not depend on the geometry of\nthe dislocation periodic array and which converges reasonably with the size of the simulation cell. Moreover, it\nis close to the norm of the Burgers vector (b = 2.5 \u00c5) as\ntheoretically expected40 .\n\nAppendix B: Carbon dipolar tensor\n\nA solute C atom embedded in a Fe matrix is modeled\nwithin elasticity theory by a dipolar tensor41 Pij . As\nshown in Ref. 28, the value of this tensor can be simply deduced from the stress tensor measured in atomistic\nsimulations where one solute atom is embedded in the\nsolvent using periodic boundary conditions. One predicts\nthat the homogeneous stress measured in these simulations varies linearly with the inverse of the volume V of\n\n\f12\nNumber of Fe atoms\n432 250\n128\n0\n\nNumber of Fe atoms\n432 250\n128\n20\n\n(a) \u03c3xx = \u03c3yy\n\u03c3zz\nMoments (eV)\n\nStress (GPa)\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n16\n(b) Pxx = \u2212V \u03c3xx\nPzz = \u2212V \u03c3zz\n12\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22122\n0\n\n8\n\n2\u00d710\u22124 4\u00d710\u22124 6\u00d710\u22124\n1/V (\u00c5\u22123)\n\n0\n\n2\u00d710\u22124 4\u00d710\u22124 6\u00d710\u22124\n1/V (\u00c5\u22123)\n\nFIG. 12. Variation of the stress \u03c3ij and of the corresponding\ndipolar tensor Pij with the inverse of the volume V of a unit\ncell containing one C atom in a [001] variant embedded in an\nFe matrix. Symbols correspond to ab initio calculations and\nsolid lines to Eq. (B1) and (B2).\n\nthe unit cell,\n\u03c3ij = \u2212\n\nPij\n.\nV\n\nBecause of the small size of the unit cell used in ab\ninitio calculations, one has to take into account the\npolarizability21\u201323 of the C atom, i.e. the fact that the\ntensor Pij depends of the strain \u03b5C\nkl locally applied on the\nC atom. One can write to first order\n\u0001\n0\n1\nC\nPij \u03b5C\nkl = Pij + Pijkl \u03b5kl ,\n\nwhere Pij0 is the C dipolar tensor in an unstrained crystal\n1\nand Pijkl\nits first derivative with respect to the applied\nstrain. In our atomistic simulations, this applied strain\n\u03b5C\nkl arises from the periodic images of the C atom. The\nstrain created by a point defect varies linearly with the\ninverse of the cube of the separation distance and we use\nfor our atomistic simulations homothetic unit cells with\nthe same cubic shape. The dipolar tensor Pij should\ntherefore vary linearly with the inverse of the volume of\nthe unit cell,\nPij = Pij0 +\n\n\u03b4Pij\n,\nV\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere \u03b4Pij is a constant depending only on the shape of\nthe unit cell and not on its volume. As a consequence,\nthe stress measured in the atomistic simulations should\nvary like\n\u03c3ij = \u2212\n\nPij0\n\u03b4Pij\n\u2212 2 .\nV\nV\n\n(B2)\n\nWe performed ab initio calculations to obtain the values of the dipolar tensor, characterizing one carbon atom\nin the iron matrix. We chose a cubic unit cell which contains one C atom in an octahedral interstitial site. The\nsimulation boxes contain 128, 250, or 432 Fe atoms. The\nSiesta calculation details are the same as for dislocation\n\ncalculations, and 13 numerical pseudoatomic orbitals per\ncarbon atom are used to represent the valence electrons\nas described in Ref. 42. The k-point grids used for the\ncalculations are 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 for the 128 and 250 atom cells\nand 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 for the 432 atom cells.\nBecause of the tetragonal symmetry of the octahedral\ninterstitial site, the dipolar tensor characterizing the C\natom is diagonal with only two independent components.\nThis agrees with the symmetry of the stress tensor given\nby ab initio calculations. The variations of this stress\ntensor with the volume of the unit cell are in perfect\nagreement with Eq. (B2) (Fig. 12). This allows us to\ndeduce the elastic dipole Pij which is characterized by\nthe values Pxx = Pyy = 8.9 and Pzz = 17.5 eV for the\n[100] variant of the C atom in the dilute limit [V \u2192 \u221e\nin Eq. (B1)].\nPrevious ab initio calculations performed in smaller\nsimulation cells have led to the C atom dipolar tensor\ndeduced from Kanzaki forces43 . These values are consistent with the ones we have deduced from the homogeneous stress.\nTABLE II.

If all carbon atoms are located on the [001]\nvariant of the octahedral site,\na(xC ) = a0 (1 + \u03b4x xC ) , along the [100] or [010] axis,\nc(xC ) = a0 (1 + \u03b4z xC ) , along the [001] axis,\nwhere a0 is the pure Fe lattice parameter. The parameters \u03b4x and \u03b4z deduced from our DFT calculations are\ncompared to experimental data44\u201346 in Table II. The ab\ninitio calculations lead to a formation volume of carbon\nlarger than the experimental value, and to a larger tetragonal distortion expressed as (\u03b4z \u2212 \u03b4x ).\nOne can also deduce from the elastic dipole the variation of the solution enthalpy of C in bcc Fe with a volume\nexpansion,\nV0\nexc\n\n\u2202H exc\n\u2202V\n\nV =V0\n\n1\n= \u2212 Pii ,\n3\n\nwhere H\nis the excess enthalpy of a Fe crystal of equilibrium volume V0 containing one C atom.
