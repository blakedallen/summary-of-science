We discuss the relation between 'bare' cosmological parameters determining the\ncosmological model, and the parameters interpreted by observers with a \"Friedmannian bias\", which\nare 'dressed' by the smoothed\u2013out geometrical inhomogeneities of the surveyed spatial region.\nPACS numbers: 04.20 , 98.80 , 02.40 K\n\nA considerable body of researchers in cosmology holds\nthe attitude that, in view of ongoing and near future\nhigh\u2013precision experiments in observational cosmology,\nthe (to a large extent established) standard model of\ncosmology will be finally determined. In particular, this\nattitude is supported by the possibility of precisely and\nunambigously determining the three numbers that fix the\nobserver's position in the cosmic triangle and characterize the parameters of a FLRW cosmology [1]. Refinement\nof observational data, however, must be paraphrased by\na refinement of the theoretical cosmological model. In\nparticular, the widely hold working assumption that the\nstandard model idealizes in a dynamically consistent way\nthe real inhomogeneous Universe should be tested and\nquestioned. For instance, the conjecture that the standard model is equivalent to an averaged inhomogeneous\nmodel cannot be held (e.g., [11]). Indeed, in this context, the deviations of the average model from the standard model are condensed into a 'backreaction effect'. It\ncan be explored to understand the influence of structure\ninhomogeneities on the evolution of the standard model\nparameters regionally, but may not impair the robustness of the conceivably simplest cosmological model on\nthe largest scales.\nComplementary to this 'backreaction effect', we, in this\nLetter, want to elaborate on a key\u2013insight into the interpretation of cosmological parameters that, so far, escaped\nthe attention of researchers in cosmology. It adds a new\naspect to the discussion of the effect of inhomogeneites\non the standard model parameters, but \u2013 moreover \u2013 it\nprovides an answer to the fundamental problem of interpreting cosmological parameters in an inhomogeneous\nspacetime geometry.\nLet us develop a picture that may guide our thoughts.\nImagine a finite amount of material mass distributed inhomogeneously within some spatial domain. We simplify\nthe problem by assuming that the astronomical experiment is carried out in a sufficiently shallow survey region, so that the observed objects, within the approximation standards we want to imply, all lie in a 'spatial'\n\nsection and, referring to the space section itself, we assume that the theoretical model already gives us a suitable split into space and time, i.e., a foliation of spacetime. Suppose now that the observer would be able to\nquantify the observed objects by their amount of material\nmass, employing, of course, some theoretical considerations, so that the simplest quantity that the astronomical experiment returns is the total amount of material\nmass contained within the observed portion of the Universe. This in turn determines, up to the normalization\nby the \"Hubble\u2013constant\" to which we come later, one of\nthe standard cosmological parameters on the scale of the\nobserved region, the density parameter, if the amount of\nmass is divided by the surveyed volume. It is here, where\nthe 'interpretation problem' comes into the fore: the \"observer's Universe\", due to a lack of better standards, is\na constant curvature space section given by the standard\nmodel. Calculating the average density with the \"Friedmannian volume\" is, in this picture, considered as the\nactual source in Friedmann's equation.\nOne of the reasons for this commonly held view is that\nNewtonian cosmology is the familiar framework of structure formation models, and the standard (constant) curvature parameter is merely taken to determine the 'background' FLRW model, while structures are described\nwithin a Euclidean homogeneous space geometry. The\ncareful reader would object that the actual surveyed volume of the spatial domain is not the volume of a constant curvature FLRW domain, but \u2013 taking the curvature fluctuations due to the inhomogeneities into account\n\u2013 is rather the volume of the bumpy geometry of the surveyed region. There is an obvious difference between the\n'bare' density parameter (the actual material mass density source), and the parameter obtained with a \"Friedmannian bias\". We may say that the latter is 'dressed' by\nthe geometrical inhomogeneities, which the \"interpreter\"\nimagines to be smoothed\u2013out, so that the averaged material mass density field is actually considered as an average\nover a homogeneous geometry. We are going to focus on\nthe relation between 'bare' and 'dressed' parameters.\n\n\f2\nEFFECTIVE COSMOLOGICAL MODELS\n\nTo begin with let us recall a central result in connection with the averaging problem. It has recently been\nshown that a set of 'generalized Friedmann equations',\nwhich also incorporate structure inhomogeneities, govern\nthe effective cosmological evolution [2]. 'Effective' means\nthat the homogeneous\u2013isotropic variables of the FLRW\nmodel are replaced by their Riemannian volume averages\non some given spatial domain. In relativistic cosmology\nthe generalized Friedmann equations, restricted here to\nthe simplest matter model 'irrotational dust' (more general matter models are discussed in [3]), read:\n6HB2 0 \u2212 16\u03c0Gh\u033aiB0 \u2212 2\u039b + hRiB0 = \u2212QK\nB0 ; (1)\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\nd\n2/3\n\u22122/3 d\n2\n+ VB\u22122\nhRiB0 VB0\n= 0 , (2)\nQK\nVB0\nB0 VB0\n0\ndt\ndt\nwhere we have defined, on the averaging domain B0 , the\nregional Hubble parameter as 1/3 of the spatially averaged\nrate of expansion \u03b8:\nZ\nd\nVB\n1\n3HB0 := h\u03b8iB0 =\n(3)\n\u03b8 d\u03bcg = dt 0 .\nVB0 B0\nVB0\nR\nVB0 = B0 d\u03bcg is the volume of the domain of averaging, d\u03bcg the Riemannian volume element associated with\nthe 3\u2212metric gab of the hypersurface, R is the intrinsic\nis the average matter\nscalar curvature, h\u033aiB0 := MB0 VB\u22121\n0\nd\ndenotes the time\u2013\ndensity, where MB0 = const., and dt\nderivative in a comoving frame. (Note that the zero\u2013\nsubscript indicates that the averaging domain has the\noriginal non\u2013averaged geometry; we shall later also refer\nto the corresponding smoothed\u2013out domain.)\nThe explicit source term QK\nB0 , the kinematical backreaction, appearing in the above equations quantifies the\ndeviations of the average model from the standard FLRW\nmodel. It is composed of two positive\u2013definite fluctuation\nterms (see: [2]): first, shear fluctuations that tend to\nmimic the presence of a (kinematical) dark matter component decelerating the expansion and, second, expansion amplitude fluctuations that tend to mimic a time\u2013\ndependent positive cosmological term, an accelerating\ncomponent ('quintessence').\nEq. (2) shows that the averaged scalar curvature is coupled to the 'backreaction' dynamically, which is not the\ncase in the corresponding Newtonian set of equations [5].\nFor QK\nB0 = 0 the set of generalized Friedmann equations\n\u22122/3\n\nis closed, and we have from Eq. (2) hRiB0 \u221d VB0\nin\nagreement with the evolution of the spatially constant\ncurvature in the standard model.\nFurthermore, in the general model, we may define regional cosmological parameters as the following scale\u2013\ndependent functionals [2]:\n\u03a9M\nB0 :=\n\n\u039b\nhRiB0\n8\u03c0GMB0\n; \u03a9\u039b\n; \u03a9R\n, (4)\nB0 :=\nB0 := \u2212\n2\n3VB0 HB0\n3HB2 0\n6HB2 0\n\nand ,\n\nK\n\n\u03a9Q\nB0 := \u2212\n\nQK\nB0\n,\n6HB2 0\n\n(5)\n\nobeying by construction the relation:\nK\n\nQ\nR\n\u039b\n\u03a9M\nB 0 + \u03a9B 0 + \u03a9B 0 + \u03a9B 0\n\n= 1 .\n\n(6)\n\nIn contrast to the standard FLRW cosmological parameters there are four players. In the FLRW case there is by\ndefinition no kinematical backreaction, QK\nB0 = 0. Hence,\nthe 'effective cosmology' can be determined by a scale\u2013\ndependent and regional 'cosmic quartet' [4] rather than\nby a global 'cosmic triangle' [1].\nIt is generally agreed that quantitative investigations of\nthe (kinematical) backreaction effect point towards two\nresults: first, the contribution of QK\nB0 to the 'cosmic quartet' is quantitatively small in sufficiently large expanding\ndomains of the Universe (it may contribute significantly\non cluster scales and below [15] and may be attributed to\ncosmic variance on large scales); second, the dynamical\ninfluence of a non\u2013vanishing backreaction on the other\n(standard) cosmological parameters can \u2013 nevertheless \u2013\nbe large, in other words, the values of the standard parameters found on a given hypersurface at an evolved\ntime are, in general, not related to their initial values\naccording to the FLRW model (for an investigation in\nNewtonian cosmology see: [6]).\nDRESSING COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS\n\nEq. (6) forms the basis of a discussion of cosmological parameters as they determine the theoretical model.\nThey may not be, however, directly accessible to observations. Unlike in Newtonian cosmology, where the corresponding equations have a similar form [5], it is not\nstraightforward to compare the above relativistic average model parameters to observational data. The reason is that the volume\u2013averages contain information on\nthe actually present geometrical inhomogeneities within\nthe averaging domain. In contrast, the \"observer's Universe\" is described in terms of a Euclidean or constant\ncurvature model. Consequently, the interpretation of observations within the set of the standard model parameters, if extended by the backreaction parameter or not,\nneglects the geometrical inhomogeneities that (through\nthe Riemannian volume\u2013average) are hidden in the average characteristics of the theoretical cosmology. In other\nwords, an averaging procedure in relativistic cosmology\nis not complete unless we device a way to also average\nthe geometrical inhomogeneities. Since geometrical fields\nare tensorial variables for which possible strategies of averaging form the subject of considerable controversy in\nthe relativistic literature, there is some ambiguity in how\nsuch an averaging could be implemented.\nWe have suggested an answer to this problem in [7],\nand here we wish to exploit our results for comparing the\n\n\f3\noriginal averaged model of a surveyed region of the Universe with the geometrically smoothed\u2013out model which\ngoverns the interpretation of the observer's data. This\nturns out to be rather simple and physically clear, so\nthat we think that explaining the details of the smoothing procedure is not mandatory in this Letter. It suffices\nto say that the idea of smoothing\u2013out the geometrical\ninhomogeneities was implemented in [7] (see also [10] for\na preliminary attempt), by designing a smoothing flow\non the basis of the geometrical scaling properties of the\nmatter variables. Moreover, such a smoothing was implemented on a regional and Lagrangian basis, i.e., the metric and the matter variables are smoothed on a geodesic\ndomain in such a way as to preserve its material content.\nSuch requirements characterize in a natural way a Ricci\ndeformation flow for the metric [7]. It is perhaps interesting to note that such a flow is extensively studied in the\nmathematical literature (see, e.g.: [13], [8], [9]), where\nthe Ricci flow plays a basic role in mapping a bumpy\n3\u2212geometry into a homogeneous geometry.\nLet us highlight some results.\nAccording to [7], the picture discussed in the introduction strictly depends on the ratio between two density\nprofiles defined in the averaging domain: one is naturally associated with the actual matter content of the\ngravitational sources, whereas the other is the mass density corresponding to the matter content in the given region, but now thought of as averaged over a geometrically\nsmoothed\u2013out domain B with homogeneous geometry:\n\nfrom scalar invariants of the intrinsic curvature, appears\nto have a similar form as the 'kinematical backreaction'\nterm (that was built from invariants of the extrinsic curvature). It features two positive\u2013definite parts, the scalar\ncurvature amplitude fluctuations and fluctuations in metrical anisotropies. Depending on which part dominates\nwe obtain an under\u2013 or overestimate of the actual averaged scalar curvature, respectively. \u03b2 parametrizes integral curves of the smoothing flow for the metric, so that\nthe expression above indeed refers to the explicit form of\nthis flow. Notwithstanding, this term may be estimated\nby the actual curvature fluctuations, since the Ricci flow\nacts in a controllable way such that the maxima of the\ncurvature inhomogeneities are monotonically decreasing\nduring the deformation.\nFrom Eq. (9) we can understand the physical content\nof geometrical averaging. It makes transparent that, in\nthe smoothed model, the averaged scalar curvature is\n'dressed' both by the volume effect mentioned above, and\nby the curvature backreaction effect itself. The volume effect is expected precisely in the form occurring in (9), if\nwe think of comparing two regions of distinct volumes,\nbut with the same matter content, in a constant curvature space. Whereas the backreaction term encodes the\ndeviation of the averaged scalar curvature from a constant curvature model, e.g., a FLRW space section.\n\nh\u033aiB0 = MB0 /VB0 ; h\u033aiB = MB /VB .\n\nThe results discussed above allow us to relate the actual parameters (4) and (5) to the values of such parameters obtained as regional averages on a homogeneous geometry by the smoothing procedure. We have seen that\na \"Friedmannian bias\" in modelling the real observed region of the Universe with a smooth matter distribution\nevolving in a homogeneous and isotropic geometry, inevitably 'dresses' the matter density h\u033aiB , the Hubble parameter H B , and the scalar curvature RB with correction\nfactors. Correspondingly, an observer with a \"Friedmannian bias\" would interprete his measurements in terms of\nthe 'dressed' cosmological parameters:\n\n(7)\n\nOur assumption of the regional smoothing was such that\nthe total masses are the same, so that we infer from (7)\nthat the average density measured with a \"Friedmannian\nbias\" is dressed by a volume effect due to the difference\nbetween the volume of a smoothed region and the actual\nvolume of the bumpy region:\nh\u033aiB0 = h\u033aiB (VB /VB0 ) .\n\n(8)\n\nA further result that explicitly involves the geometrical\nsmoothing flows is formed by the relation between the\nconstant regional curvature in the smoothed model (e.g.,\na FLRW domain) and the actual regional average curvature in the theoretical cosmology:\nRB = hRiB0 (VB /VB0 )\u22122/3 \u2212 QR\nB0 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere we have introduced a novel measure for the 'backreaction' of geometrical inhomogeneities capturing the\ndeviations from the standard FLRW space section, the\nR\u221e\nVB\u03b2 (\u03b2)\nregional curvature backreaction: QR\nB0 := 0 d\u03b2\nVB *\ni\nh\n\u0001\n2\n1\nab\n,\ni\n\u2212\n2h\nR\u0303\n(\u03b2)\nR\u0303\n(\u03b2)i\nh\nR(\u03b2)\n\u2212\nhR(\u03b2)i\nB\nab\nB\nB\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n3\n\nwith R\u0303ab := Rab \u2212 31 gab R being the trace\u2013free part of\nthe Ricci tensor Rab in the hypersurface.

Introducing the dimensionless parameters\n\u03bd :=\n\nVB\nVB0\n\n2\n\n; \u03b1 :=\n\nQR\nHB\nB0\n;\n\u03bc\n:=\n,\nHB2 0\nRB\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nwe can formally study fractions of 'bare' and 'dressed'\nparameters (making sure that the denominators are non\u2013\nzero, which is the case in generic situations):\n\u03a9M\nB0\nM\n\n\u03a9B\n\u03a9R\nB0\nR\n\u03a9B\n\n= \u03b1\n\n= \u03b1\u03bd ;\n\n\u03a9\u039b\nB0\n\u039b\n\n\u03a9B\n\nhRiB0\n= \u03b1 \u03bd 2/3 (1 + \u03bc) ;\nRB\n\n= \u03b1 ;\nK\n\u03a9Q\nB0\nQK\n\u03a9B\n\n=\n\n(12)\nQK\n\u03b1 BK0\nQB\n\n.\n\nThe above listed relations appear to provide a formal\nrecipee for interpreting the cosmological parameters. Let\nus illustrate them by considering mixed fractions of various cosmological parameters in order to eliminate, say\nthe fraction of the Hubble parameters \u03b1, and conclude\non the values of the others:\nM\n\n\u03a9M\n\u03a9 \u03bd 1/3\nB0\n= BR\n;\nR\n\u03a9B 0\n\u03a9B 1 + \u03bc\n\nM\n\n\u03a9M\n\u03a9\nB0\n= B\u039b \u03bd .\n\u03a9\u039b\n\u03a9B\nB0\n\n(13)\n\nReflecting the contemporary view on the cosmological parameters, we may consider a region of the Universe on a\nsufficiently large scale of the order of 1 Gpc/h. The (possibly also 'dressed') observations of the first doppler peak\nin the CMB fluctuations at the \"Friedmannian scale\"\n\u2248 100 Mpc/h favour an approximately vanishing average\ncurvature RB \u2248 0. Let us, for simplicity, approximate\nboth the 'bare' and 'dressed' 'kinematical backreaction'\nparameters by zero. If, again for simplicity, we approximate also the 'curvature backreaction' parameter by zero,\n\u03bc \u2248 0 (in the sense that there are curvature fluctuations present, but the two positive\u2013definite parts compensate each other), we would have an approximately vanishing average curvature also in the actual cosmological\nmodel. Then, the standard argument requires compensation of the observed matter content (including dark baryonic and possibly dark nonbaryonic matter components),\nM\nobeying the commonly agreed upper bound \u03a9B \u2264 0.3\n\u039b\nwith a cosmological term \u03a9B \u2248 0.7. For the 'bare' pa0.3\nM\nrameters we then obtain \u03a9B0 /\u03a9\u039b\nB0 \u2248 0.7 \u03bd, which yields\nthe estimate:\n\u03a9M\nB0\n\n0.3\n0.3\nM\n\u2248\n\u03bd/(1 +\n\u03bd) ; \u03a9\u039b\nB 0 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03a9B 0 .\n0.7\n0.7\n\n(14)\n\nThis certainly oversimplified example shows that, instead\nof postulating the presence of a large cosmological term,\nthe 'bare' mass parameter could still acquire values close\nto one, if 'undressed', and if the volume fraction \u03bd is substantially greater than 1. The second relation in Eq. (12)\nthen shows, that the actual Hubble\u2013parameter would be\nlarger than the 'dressed' one.\nA quantitative estimate that gives us an idea of the order of magnitude of the volume effect has been worked out\nby Hellaby [14] comparing spherically symmetric with\nFLRW solutions. He employs \"volume matching\" as proposed by Ellis and Stoeger [12] which should, however,\n\namount to a similar effect as a comparison of the models\nat equal mass. He finds that the spatial averages of the\ndensity profiles as compared with the corresponding (fitted) FLRW parameters yield errors in the range 10\u221230%\nfor realistically modelled clusters and voids.\nIt appears that the interpretation of relativistic cosmological parameters is far from trivial, given that we\ndid neither touch on the issue of averaging on the observer's light\u2013cone in which case the discussed effect interacts with the time\u2013evolution of the model (compare\nthe detailed suggestion in [12]), nor did we study the\nsmoothing itself in a dynamical setting. As the present\ndiscussion shows, a thorough investigation of volumes of\nrealistic cosmological slices as the \"simplest\" quantity\nwould considerably enhance our theoretical background\nto approach observational data. As in other fields like\nsolid state physics, where the study of surface roughening is well\u2013developed, cosmology could face the necessity\nof understanding geometrical structure formation, as it\nwas facing the necessity of understanding structure formation on a homogeneous geometry.\nTB would like to thank Martin Kerscher and Yasushi\nSuto for constructive remarks.
