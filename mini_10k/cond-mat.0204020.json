Frustration generally suppresses the tendency towards the classical N\u00e8el ordering\nand leads to a wide variety of exotic phenomena such as a spontaneous breaking of the translational\nsymmetry in a one-dimensional (1D) system and spin-liquid states in 2D and 3D systems. Among\nthem, the possibility of a novel \"chiral\" phase in 1D frustrated quantum spin systems has been\nstudied intensively in recent years.\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n\nThis chiral phase is characterized by the absence\n\nof the helical long-range order (LRO),\nm(q) =\n\n1 X\nS l eiql = 0\nLS l\n\n(for \u2200 q),\n\n(1.1)\n\nand the non-zero value of the z-component of the total vector chirality,8)\nO\u03ba =\n\n1 X\n\u03bal 6= 0,\nLS 2 l\n\ny\nx\n= [S l \u00d7 S l+1 ]z ,\n\u2212 Sly Sl+1\n\u03bal = Slx Sl+1\n\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: HIKIHARA.Toshiya@nims.go.jp\n\n1\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fwhere S l is a spin-S operator at site l and L is the system size assumed to be even throughout this\npaper. The chiral phase breaks only the parity symmetry spontaneously with preserving the timereversal and translational symmetries. Using the bosonization method, Nersesyan et al. predicted\nthe appearance of the chiral phase in the frustrated antiferromagnetic S = 1/2 chain with nearestneighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings of easy-plane anisotropy.1) From the analytical2, 3)\nand numerical4, 5, 6) studies, it has been shown that the chiral phase appears in the frustrated chain\nwith the anisotropic couplings in general spin-S cases. The ground-state phase diagrams for the\nS = 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 cases have been determined numerically.5, 6)\nAnother interesting observation in the studies3, 4, 5, 6) is that there exist two different chiral phases\nin the integer-S cases. One of them is the \"chiral-Haldane\" phase where the chiral LRO coexists\nwith the string LRO9, 10)\nOstr\n\nl\u22121\nX\n1 X\n\u03c0\n=\ni Skz Slz ,\nexp\nLS l\nS\nk=1\n\n!\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich characterizes the well-known Haldane phase,11, 12) and the spin correlation function decays\nexponentially with a finite energy gap. The other is the \"gapless chiral\" phase where the chiral LRO\nexists and the spin and string correlation functions decay algebraically with gapless excitations.\nIt has been shown that for S = 1 and 2 the gapless chiral phase exists in a broad region of the\nground-state phase diagrams while the chiral-Haldane phase exists in a narrow region between the\nHaldane and gapless chiral phases. (See Fig. 1 in ref. 5 and Fig. 9 in ref. 6.) For S = 1/2 and 3/2,\non the other hand, the gapless chiral phase exists as in the integer-S cases while the chiral phase\nwith a finite energy gap has not been identified.\nAs the mechanism generating the chiral phases, easy-plane anisotropy plays an essential role\nas well as frustration does. The anisotropy lowers the symmetry of the system from SU (2) to\nU (1) \u00d7 Z2 and induces a two-fold discrete degeneracy according as the right- and left-handed\nchirality. In fact, the chiral phases do not appear in the isotropic case where the discrete chiral\ndegeneracy no longer exists. From the experimental viewpoint, the anisotropy in real materials\ncommonly takes the form of the uniaxial single-ion-type. It is therefore important to study the\neffect of the single-ion-type anisotropy on the chiral phases, for the sake of exploring experimental\nimplications of the theoretical results and stimulating an investigation into the chiral phases in real\nmaterials. Nevertheless, most of the theoretical findings on the chiral phases mentioned above have\nbeen obtained for the case of the anisotropic exchange couplings. Kolezhuk3) studied recently the\nfrustrated integer-S spin chain with the single-ion-type anisotropy by means of a large-S approach\nand presented a schematic phase diagram including the gapless chiral phase and a chiral phase with\na finite energy gap. However, systematic studies on the chiral phases in the case of single-ion-type\nanisotropy have been scarce so far.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the ground-state properties of the frustrated S = 1\n\n2\n\n\fHeisenberg chain with the uniaxial single-ion-type anisotropy. The model Hamiltonian is given by\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u03c1=1,2\n\n(\n\nJ\u03c1\n\nX\n\n)\n\nS l * S l+\u03c1 + D\n\nl\n\nX\n\n(Slz )2 .\n\n(1.4)\n\nl\n\nI concentrate on the case of the antiferromagnetic couplings (J1 > 0 and J2 > 0) and the easy-plane\nanisotropy (D > 0). Hereafter I denote j \u2261 J2 /J1 and d \u2261 D/J1 . The ground-state properties\nof the model (1.4) have been studied for some limiting cases. For j = 0 the phase transition\nbetween the Haldane and large-D (LD) phases have been studied intensively.13, 14, 15, 16) It has been\nfound that as d increases the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from the Haldane\nphase to the LD phase at d = 1.000 \u00b1 0.001.16) Meanwhile, it has been shown for d = 0 that as\nj increases the system undergoes a first order transition at j \u2243 0.747 from the Haldane phase to\nthe \"double Haldane\" (DH) phase,5, 17, 18) in which the next-nearest-neighbor coupling J2 becomes\ndominant so that the system is described as two Haldane subchains weakly coupled by the intersubchain coupling J1 . The string LRO vanishes discontinuously at the transition. Furthermore, the\nappearance of the gapless and gapped chiral phases has been predicted by the large-S approach.3)\nIn the present work, I determine numerically the ground-state phase diagram of the model (1.4) by\nemploying the same method as the one used in our previous works:4, 5, 6) I calculate the appropriate\ncorrelation functions associated with the order parameters characterizing each phase using the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method,19, 20) and then, analyze their long-distance\nbehaviors. From the obtained phase diagram, we find that the gapless chiral phase appears in a\nbroad region of the j-d plane while the chiral-Haldane phase appears in a narrow region between\nthe Haldane and gapless chiral phases, which are essentially the same as those in the case of the\nanisotropic exchange couplings. It is found further that, in addition to the gapless chiral and chiralHaldane phases, another novel chiral phase exists between the gapless chiral and LD phases. This\n\"chiral-LD\" phase is characterized by the chiral LRO and the exponential decay of both the spin\nand string correlation functions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72, I introduce the chiral, string, and spin correlation\nfunctions associated with each order parameter and explain the numerical method. The obtained\nphase diagram and numerical data are presented in \u00a73. The results are summarized in \u00a74.\n\u00a72.\n\nCorrelation Functions and Numerical Method\n\nThe method used to determine the phase diagram is essentially the same as those used in our\nprevious works.4, 5, 6) I have calculated the two-point chiral, string, and spin correlation functions\ndefined by\nC\u03ba (l, l\u2032 ) = h\u03bal \u03bal\u2032 i,\n\n(2.1)\n\uf8eb\n\nCstr (l, l\u2032 ) = hSlz exp \uf8edi\u03c0\n\n3\n\nl\u2032 \u22121\n\nX\nk=l\n\n\uf8f6\n\nSkz \uf8f8 Slz\u2032 i,\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fCsx (l, l\u2032 ) = hSlx Slx\u2032 i,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich are associated with the order parameters (1.2), (1.3), and (1.1), respectively. The notation\nz\nh* * *i represents the expectation value in the lowest energy state in the subspace of Stotal\n=\n\nP\n\nl\n\nSlz = 0\n\nwith even parity. It has been checked by the exact-diagonalization calculation that the ground state\nof the chain indeed belongs to the subspace. The calculation has been performed for various fixed\nvalues of d (j) with varying j (d). Then, I have estimated the transition points jc (dc ) by examining\nthe dependence of the correlation functions on r = |l \u2212 l\u2032 | at long distance.\nI have employed the infinite-system DMRG algorithm originally introduced by White19, 20) and\naccelerated it by making use of the recursion relation proposed by Nishino and Okunishi.21, 22) The\nnumber of kept states m is up to 350 if not otherwise mentioned. The convergence of the data\nwith respect to m has been checked by increasing m consecutively. Since the truncation error of\nthe DMRG calculation increases dramatically as j increases, the calculation is limited to rather\nsmall j. However, I consider that the region of j treated in this work, j <\n\u223c 1, is enough to study\nthe properties of the chiral phases which we wish to know. In the calculations, the open boundary\ncondition has been imposed for the sake of the best performance of the algorithm. Accordingly,\nin order to avoid the unwanted boundary effect, the two-point correlation functions have been\ncalculated for the sites l and l\u2032 near the center of the chain, i.e., l = l0 \u2212 r/2 and l\u2032 = l0 + r/2\nwhere l0 = L/2 for even r and l0 = (L + 1)/2 for odd r. By checking the convergence of the data\nwith increasing L typically up to 2000, I have confirmed that the data are free from the effect of\nthe open boundaries.\n\u00a73.\n\nPhase Diagram\n\nBy examining the long-distance behaviors of the chiral, string, and spin correlation functions\nintroduced in the previous section, I have determined the ground-state phase diagram of the model\n(1.4) in the j-d plane. The obtained phase diagram shown in Fig. 1 includes six different phases,\ni.e., the Haldane, LD, DH, gapless chiral, chiral-Haldane, and chiral-LD phases. The long-distance\nbehaviors of the correlation functions in each of the phases are summarized in Table I. We can\nsee in Fig.1 that the gapless chiral phase appears in a broad region of the phase diagram while\nthe chiral-Haldane phase appears between the Haldane and gapless chiral phases. Further we\nfind the chiral-LD phase, where the chiral LRO exists while the spin and string correlation decay\nexponentially, between the LD and gapless chiral phases. Two multi-critical points, at least, are\nobserved: One of them is at (jM 1 , dM 1 ) \u2243 (0.51, 0.76) among the Haldane, LD, gapless chiral,\nchiral-Haldane, and chiral-LD phases while the other is at (jM 2 , dM 2 ) \u2243 (0.75, 0.15) among the\nHaldane, gapless chiral, chiral-Haldane and DH phases. The numerical data for each transition line\nare discussed in the following subsections.\n\n4\n\n\f3.1\n\nHaldane-chiral transition\n\nFirst let us consider the phase transitions between the Haldane and chiral phases. Figures 2(a)(c) show the data of the chiral, string, and spin correlation functions in log-log plots for d = 0.5 and\nseveral typical values of j. The data of the spin correlation shown in Fig. 2 (c) are divided by the\nleading oscillating factor cos(Qr) where Q is the wavenumber characterizing the incommensurate\noscillation of Csx (r) in real space. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 (a) that the data of the chiral\ncorrelation function C\u03ba (r) are bent upward for j > jc1 \u2243 0.635 suggesting a finite chiral LRO while\nthey are bent downward for j < jc1 suggesting the absence of the chiral ordering. The transition\npoint where the chiral LRO sets in is estimated to be jc1 = 0.635\u00b10.005. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), the\nstring correlation function exhibits a finite LRO for j < jc2 \u2243 0.670 whereas it decays algebraically\nfor j > jc2 .23) Meanwhile, the data of the spin correlation function shown in Fig. 2 (c) are bent\ndownward for j < jc2 suggesting an exponential decay with a finite energy gap while they exhibit\na linear behavior for j > jc2 suggesting a power-law decay with gapless excitations. The transition\npoint jc2 where the string LRO and the energy gap vanish is estimated to be jc2 = 0.670 \u00b1 0.010.\nIt should be noticed that the estimate of jc2 is distinctly larger than that of jc1 . Accordingly,\nthe chiral-Haldane phase where the chiral and string LROs coexist and the spin correlation decays\nexponentially exists in a narrow but finite region between the Haldane and gapless chiral phases.\nThe existence of the chiral-Haldane phase can be clearly seen from the behavior of the correlation\nfunctions at j = 0.640 and 0.660 which lie between jc1 and jc2 . Thus, it is concluded that the system\nundergoes two successive transitions as j increases, first at j = jc1 from the Haldane phase to the\nchiral-Haldane phase, and then, at j = jc2 to the gapless chiral phase. The results are essentially\nthe same as the ones observed in the frustrated chain with anisotropic exchange couplings.4, 5)\nPerforming calculations in the same manner for various fixed d (j) with varying j (d), I have\ndetermined the transition points jc1 (dc1 ) and jc2 (dc2 ) plotted in Fig. 1. The figure may suggest that the transition lines connecting the estimated points run from the multi-critical point\n(jM 1 , dM 1 ) to the other multi-critical point (jM 2 , dM 2 ). The chiral-Haldane phase is identified for\nd = 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 while it is not for d = 0.2 within the calculation with varying j at intervals of 0.002. However, I note that it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the chiral-Haldane\nphase exists in a too narrow region to be detected. Thus it is not clear whether the transition lines\n\u2032 , d\u2032 ) with d\u2032\njc1 and jc2 merge at (jM 2 , dM 2 ) or at another multi-critical point (jM\n2 M2\nM 2 > 0.2. In the\n\u2032 between the Haldane and gapless chiral phases connects (j \u2032 , d\u2032 )\nlatter case, a transition line jc1\nM2 M2\n\nand (jM 2 , dM 2 ). For d = 0.1 and 0.05, on the other hand, the chiral LRO is not observed. In\nthese cases, it is also found that the string LRO vanishes discontinuously at the transition point\nand the spin correlation function exhibits an exponential decay for all calculated values of j. The j\ndependence of the string correlation function at r \u2192 \u221e for d = 0.1 is shown in Fig. 3 together with\nthe spin-correlation length \u03be estimated by fitting the data of Csx (r) to the form of an exponential\n\n5\n\n\fdecay, Csx (r) = A cos(Qr) exp(\u2212r/\u03be), where A is a numerical constant. These behaviors of the\nstring and spin correlation functions for d = 0.1 and 0.05 suggest a first-order transition between\ntwo gapful phases, i.e., the Haldane and DH phases. From the observations, it is concluded that\nbetween d = 0.2 and d = 0.1 there is a multi-critical point (jM 2 , dM 2 ) where the transition lines jc1\n\u2032 merges with the DH-chiral transition line discussed in \u00a73.4. The\nand jc2 or the transition line jc1\n\nfirst-order transition line between the Haldane and DH phases smoothly connects the multi-critical\npoint (jM 2 , dM 2 ) to the transition point in the isotropic case (d = 0), jc2 \u2243 0.747, estimated in the\nprevious works.5, 17, 18)\n3.2\n\nLD-chiral transition\n\nWe next consider the phase transitions between the LD and chiral phases. The data of the chiral,\nstring, and spin correlation functions for j = 0.8 and several typical values of d are shown in Figs.\n4 (a)-(c) in log-log plots. As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the chiral correlation function C\u03ba (r) exhibits a\nfinite LRO for d < dc3 \u2243 1.09 while it decays exponentially for d > dc3 . The transition point dc3\nwhere the chiral LRO vanishes is thereby estimated as dc3 = 1.09 \u00b1 0.01. Meanwhile, the string\nand spin correlations decay exponentially for d > dc4 \u2243 0.80 suggesting a finite energy gap whereas\nthey decay algebraically for d < dc4 suggesting gapless excitations.23) The transition point dc4 is\nestimated to be dc4 = 0.80 \u00b1 0.10. Unfortunately, the numerical error of the estimate of dc4 is\nquite large due to the truncation error of the DMRG calculation, which tends to underestimate the\nstring and spin correlation functions. Nevertheless, from the behaviors of the correlation functions\nfor 0.94 <\n\u223c d < dc3 , it can be clearly seen that there exists a intermediate region with a finite chiral\nLRO and a finite energy gap. In order to confirm the appearance of the intermediate phase, I have\nperformed a high-precision calculation with m up to 500 for d = 1.00 and 0.94. The data shown\nin Fig. 4, which are almost free from the truncation error, clearly suggest that the parameter\npoints d = 1.00 and 0.94 indeed belong to the chiral phase with a finite energy gap. It is therefore\nconcluded that the estimate of dc4 is distinctly smaller than that of dc3 and the system undergoes\ntwo successive transitions as d decreases, first at d = dc3 from the LD phase to the \"chiral-LD\" phase\ncharacterized by a finite chiral LRO and an exponential decay of the string and spin correlation\nfunctions, and then at d = dc4 to the gapless chiral phase. Here it should be noticed that the\nchiral-LD phase is distinct from the chiral-Haldane phase with respect to the absence of the string\nLRO. Hence the chiral-LD phase can be regarded as a new type of the gapped chiral phase.\nBy the same calculation for various fixed j (d), the transition points dc3 (jc3 ) and dc4 (jc4 ) are\nestimated. In particular, the appearance of the chiral-LD phase has been confirmed by the highprecision calculations with m up to 500 for the points plotted in Fig. 1 by crosses. As seen in Fig.\n1, the chiral-LD phase appears in a finite region between the LD and gapless chiral phases. The\ntransition lines dc3 and dc4 merge with the Haldane-chiral transition lines jc1 and jc2 around the\nmulti-critical point (jM 1 , dM 1 ) into the Haldane-LD transition line discussed in the next subsection.\n\n6\n\n\f3.3\n\nHaldane-LD transition\n\nIn this subsection, we see the results for the phase transition between the Haldane and LD phases.\nThe phase transition has been studied in detail in the case of no frustration (j = 0).13, 14, 15, 16) It\nhas been pointed out that there occurs a continuous phase transition accompanying the vanishing\nof the energy gap at d = 1.000 \u00b1 0.001. In Figs. 5 (a) and (b), I show the data of the string and\nspin correlation functions for j = 0.2 and several typical values of d. Here the m convergence of\nthe data has almost been achieved even at m = 180. We can see in Fig. 5 (a) that the string\ncorrelation function exhibits a finite LRO for d < dc5 \u2243 0.90 while it exhibits an exponential decay\nfor d > dc5 . In the meantime, the spin correlation function exhibits an exponential decay for\nd \u2264 0.89 and d \u2265 0.91 in accordance with the existence of a finite energy gap in both phases while\nit decays algebraically at d = 0.90 suggesting the vanishing of the energy gap at the transition.\nThe transition point between the Haldane and LD phases for j = 0.2 is thereby estimated to be\ndc5 = 0.90 \u00b1 0.01. The transition points dc5 estimated in the same way are plotted in Fig. 1. The\ntransition line connecting the estimates runs from the point dc5 = 0.96 \u00b1 0.02 at j = 0, which is\nslightly smaller than the previous estimate dc5 (j = 0) = 1.000 \u00b1 0.001, to the multi-critical point\n(jM 1 , dM 1 ).\n3.4\n\nDH-chiral transition\n\nHere we consider the phase transition between the DH and chiral phases. Figure 6 (a) shows the\nchiral correlation function C\u03ba (r) for d = 0.3 and several typical values of j around the DH-chiral\ntransition. As shown in the figure, C\u03ba (r) exhibits a finite LRO for j < jc6 \u2243 0.820 while it decays\nexponentially for j > jc6 . Thus, the transition point where the chiral LRO vanishes is estimated to\nbe jc6 = 0.820 \u00b1 0.010. Meanwhile, the data of the spin correlation function for d = 0.3 are shown\nin Fig. 6 (b) where the data are divided by the oscillating factor cos(Qr). It can be seen in the\nfigure that as j increases the spin correlation changes its behavior from an algebraic decay to an\nexponential decay at j = jc7 \u2243 0.780. Although the truncation error of the data prevents us from\ncarrying out the precise estimation, the transition point is estimated to be jc7 = 0.780 \u00b1 0.040.\nHere arises a question: Whether jc7 is equal to or smaller than jc6 ? If jc7 is equal to jc6 , there\noccurs only one phase transition at j = jc6 = jc7 between the gapless chiral phase and the DH phase.\nOn the other hand, if jc7 is smaller than jc6 , the system undergoes two successive transitions as j\nincreases, first at j = jc6 from the gapless chiral phase to an intermediate \"chiral-DH\" phase with a\nfinite chiral LRO and a finite energy gap, and then at j = jc7 to the DH phase. Unfortunately, the\nestimates of the transition points, particularly that of jc7 , are not accurate enough to determine\nwhich of the cases is realized. Here I note that the data of the spin correlation for j = 0.800 shown\nin Fig. 6 (b) are calculated with m up to 500 and still suffer from the truncation error which is not\nnegligible. This means that it is unpromising to achieve the sufficiently accurate estimate of jc7 in\nthe manner used in this work. The difficulty in identifying the intermediate phase in this case can\n\n7\n\n\fbe ascribed partly to the fact that no order parameter characterizing the DH phase has been found\nso far24) and partly to the fact that the intermediate phase, if any, appears only in a narrow region\nwhich can be concealed behind the error bar of jc7 . Hence, the situation here is different from that\nof the Haldane-chiral transition where we can utilize the string order parameter to estimate jc2 and\nthat of the LD-chiral transition where the region of the chiral-LD phase is so broad that we can\nidentify the chiral-LD phase even with rather rough estimates of dc4 . Since it is a subtle problem\nto estimate the point where the behavior of the spin correlation changes, it might be needed for\nthe settlement of the question to introduce an order parameter characterizing the DH phase. This\nproblem remains open for future studies.\nIn the same manner, I have estimated the transition points jc6 and jc7 for d = 0.2 and d = 0.4.\nThe chiral-DH phase has not been identified also in these cases. As shown in Fig. 1, the transition\nlines connecting the estimates seem to emerge from the multi-critical point (jM 2 , dM 2 ). The values\nof jc6 and jc7 become larger as d becomes larger suggesting that the DH phase becomes stable as\nj increases.\n3.5\n\nMulti-critical point\n\nLastly, I touch upon the region of the phase diagram around the multi-critical point (jM 1 , dM 1 ).\nIt can be seen in the obtained phase diagram Fig. 1 that the five transition lines run into a narrow\nregion around (jM 1 , dM 1 ). It might be useful to classify them into three groups, i.e., the transition\nlines jc1 and dc3 where the chiral LRO sets in, the lines jc2 and dc4 between gapful and gapless\nphases, and the line dc5 between the Haldane and LD phases. Here I note that the mechanism\ngenerating the chiral LRO is essentially distinct from the one generating the energy gap2, 3) and,\nto my knowledge, no definite relation between them has been known. Thus, the behavior of the\nchiral transition lines (jc1 and dc3 ) and the \"gapful-gapless\" lines (jc2 and dc4 ) around the multicritical point is still nontrivial. Looking at Fig. 1, two possibilities seem to be left: (i) The five\ntransition lines merge at one multi-critical point (jM 1 , dM 1 ). (ii) The transition lines jc1 and dc3\nmerge with the Haldane-LD transition line dc5 at (jM 1 , dM 1 ) while the lines jc2 and dc4 merge with\nthe transition line d\u2032c5 between the chiral-Haldane and chiral-LD phases at another multi-critical\n\u2032 , d\u2032 ). These scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 7 (a) and (b), respectively. Because of the\npoint (jM\n1 M1\n\nrather large error of the estimates of dc4 mentioned in \u00a73.2, we can not decide which of the cases is\nrealized from the present numerical results. More detailed studies might be needed to identify the\nuniversality class of the multi-critical point(s) and transition lines.\n\u00a74.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, the ground-state properties of the frustrated S = 1 Heisenberg spin chain with\nuniaxial single-ion-type anisotropy (eq. (1.4)) have been investigated numerically by the infinitesystem DMRG method. By calculating the chiral, string, and spin correlation functions and analyz-\n\n8\n\n\fing their long-distance behaviors, I have determined the ground-state phase diagram for 0 \u2264 j <\n\u223c1\nand d \u2265 0 (Fig. 1). It has turned out that there exist six different phases, namely, the Haldane,\nLD, DH, gapless chiral, chiral-Haldane, and chiral-LD phases. The gapless chiral phase appears\nin a broad region of the phase diagram while the chiral-Haldane phase appears in the narrow but\nfinite region between the Haldane and gapless chiral phases; these results are essentially the same\nas those found in the frustrated S = 1 chain with anisotropic exchange couplings.4, 5) Meanwhile,\nthe chiral-LD phase has been found between the LD and gapless chiral phases. Since the chiral-LD\nphase is characterized by a finite chiral LRO, the absence of the string LRO, and the short-range\nspin correlation function, it is distinct from either the gapless chiral or the chiral-Haldane phase\nand can be regarded as a new type of the gapped chiral phases. The question about the existence\nof the possible chiral-DH phase remains open.\nAfter the theoretical finding of the chiral phases, one of the most challenging tasks is the experimental observation of the phases in real materials. As seen in the obtained phase diagram,\nthe anisotropy d >\n\u223c 0.15 and the next-nearest neighbor coupling j within a suitable range around\nj \u2243 0.75 are required for a material realizing the chiral phases. These values of d and j are realistic so that there must be a good chance to find out a material in the parameter region. If\nsuch a material is prepared, the measurement of the vector chirality (1.2) is, in principle, possible\nby using polarized neutrons.25, 26, 27) I hope that the results of the present paper stimulate further\nexperimental studies.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is very grateful to M.

However, I note that the m convergence of the data for r >\n\u223c 40 has not\nbeen achieved yet and the string correlation is enhanced as m increases. Thus, from the behavior of the string\ncorrelation for r <\n\u223c 40 where the m convergence is almost achieved, I consider that the string correlations for the\nabove j's and d's exhibit an algebraic decay and the bend-downward behavior observed for larger r is an artifact\ndue to the truncation error eventually vanishing in the limit m \u2192 \u221e.\n[24] Since the system in the DH phase can be described as two Haldane subchains, one might expect that the\nstring correlation function on each subchains can be the order parameter of the phase. Contrary to the naive\nexpectation, however, the string correlation on a subchain does not exhibit a finite LRO but decays exponentially.\n(See refs.17 and 18.)\n[25] M. L. Plumer, H. Kawamura and A.
