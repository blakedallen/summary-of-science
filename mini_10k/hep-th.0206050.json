In particular, for a five-dimensional spacetime with a metric\ngiven by\nds25 = a2 (z)(\u2212dt2 + dx2i + dz 2 ),\n\n(1.1)\n\nthen for certain factors a(z), gravity can be localized on a four-dimensional Minkowski\nsurface of a domain wall with the directions t, xi . For example, the second Randall-Sundrum\nbraneworld scenario (RS2) used a warped five-dimensional metric that could be identified\nas a slice of AdS5 , for which a(z) = (1 + k|z|)\u22121 . The absolute value ensures Z2 symmetry\nabout the domain wall, which corresponds to a delta-function potential well which localizes\nthe massless graviton state1\nAdditional factors in the metric (1.1) can yield two types of deviations from fourdimensional Minkowski space embedded in five dimensions. Firstly, additional factors could\ndepend only on our four-dimensional spacetime, such as in the case of a cosmological spacetime on the braneworld. On the other hand, if additional factors depend only on the bulk\ndimension, then the spacetime on the braneworld will appear Minkowski for its inhabitants\nbut Lorentz invariance will be broken globally [4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The second case will\nbe the focus of this paper. The corresponding metric can be written as2\nds25 = a2 (z)(\u2212b2 (z) dt2 + dx2i + dz 2 ).\n\n(1.2)\n\nThus, the five-dimensional space is foliated by surfaces which exhibit Poincar\u00e9 invariance\nfor fixed z, leading to Lorentz-invariant Standard Model particle physics on the fourdimensional braneworld, located at z = 0. Gravitons, on the other hand, are not constrained to the braneworld. Therefore, gravitational processes may reflect the fact that\nfour-dimensional Lorentz symmetry is broken globally.\nIn particular, from (1.2) the local speed of gravitational propagation is given by b(z).3\nIf b(z) increases with z then gravitational effects may propagate from one region of our\nuniverse to another by bending in the extra dimension, thereby traveling faster than light\n1\n\nSince an M-theoretic origin for this source is not known, a braneworld scenario which does not require\n\nthis is proposed in [3].\n2\nWe do not include factors which would globally break rotational invariance, as this could be in contradiction with the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background [9].\n3\n\nOne can rescale t in order for the speed of light on the braneworld at z = 0 to be unity.\n\n1\n\n\fon the braneworld 4 . Thus, regions of the universe not within each others' lightcones may\nactually affect each other via gravitation, leading to an apparent violation of causality.\nThis suggested a non-inflationary solution to the cosmological horizon problem [4, 5, 6]. It\nis important to keep in mind that causality is still maintained from the five-dimensional\nvantage point.\nUsing Birkhoff's theorem, the metric (1.2) can always be transformed into that of a\nblack hole, assuming the simplest possible sources in the bulk [9]. In particular, in the case\nof a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in AdS5 , the graviton speed b(z) increases away from\nthe braneworld for a significant fraction of the charge-mass parameter space [9, 10, 11]. In\na certain coordinate frame, the surface of the braneworld is bent in the bulk due to the\npresence of the black hole, while the graviton geodesics are straight lines. This is another\nway of visualizing that the gravitons would go into the bulk in order to connect two points\nwhich are on the braneworld.\nWe now ask the question: what M-theoretic factors give rise to a braneworld which\nis bent in the bulk? Although M-theory motivates the consideration of extra dimensions,\nit could be that braneworld scenarios are theoretically complete within a five-dimensional\nframework. However, certain aspects of braneworlds scenarios may have natural M-theoretic\norigins. Bridging the gap between M-theory and braneworld phenomenology may bring to\nlight some connections with M-theoretic ideas, which may not be apparent from a fivedimensional vantage point. In this vein, we present various gravitational Lorentz-violating\nbraneworld scenarios which arise naturally from p-brane systems. Although such scenarios\ngenerally arise from five-dimensional black holes, a plethora of higher-dimensional origins\nemerge within the framework of M-theory.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider braneworld scenarios\nwhich lift to the near-horizon region of p-brane intersections. For the cases discussed, the\nspatial portion of the braneworld corresponds to relative transverse dimensions in the pbrane system, which results in Lorentz invariance being globally broken. In Section 3, we\nfind that a braneworld scenario resulting from the near-horizon region of an M5-brane in a\nconstant C-field also exhibits the global breaking of Lorentz invariance. For both scenarios,\nthe massless graviton is quasi-localized to the brane. In Section 4, we present an example\nof a globally Lorentz-violating braneworld scenario arising from the near-horizon region of\na p-brane which is perturbed from extremality, and show that the quasi-localized graviton\n4\n\nOne recent proposal for measuring the speed of propagation of gravity (over relatively short distances)\n\nwas given in [7].\n\n2\n\n\fis massive. In Section 5, we consider a braneworld scenario which arises from AdS5 , which\ncould be interpreted as the near-horizon region of a D3-brane reduced on S 5 . For global\nAdS, the breaking of global Lorentz invariance leads to gravitons on the braneworld which,\nfrom our vantage point, traverse distances faster than light. In section 6, we discuss some\nopen issues.\n\n2\n\nBraneworld from intersecting p-branes\n\nAlbeit the imposed Z2 symmetry about z = 0, five-dimensional gravity-trapping domain\nwalls arise from ten dimensions as sphere reductions of the near-horizon region of Dp-branes\nfor p = 3, 4, 5. The domain wall resulting from a D3-brane was originally used in the RS2\nbraneworld scenario while the D4 and D5 branes yield dilatonic domain walls. In addition,\nthe D4 and M5 branes dimensionally reduce to the same domain wall, as does the D5-brane\nand M5/M5-brane intersection [12].\nIn the aforementioned cases, the observed four-dimensional spacetime lies entirely within\nthe (overall) worldvolume of the p-brane(s). This is partially motivated by holography,\nsince the above cases for which gravity is localized all have a natural decoupling limit,\nwhich suggests that the localization of gravity may generally be realized within a Domainwall/QFT correspondence5 . For example, in the original RS2 scenario, the directions of\nthe effective four-dimensional universe correspond to the worldvolume of a D3-brane in\nten dimensions. If the worldvolume of the D3-brane is Minkowski, then so is that of the\nbraneworld, thus yielding an effective four-dimensional universe that is strictly Lorentz\ninvariant. However, one could envision a system of intersecting p-branes for which some of\nthe resulting braneworld directions do not lie within the overall worldvolume of the p-branes.\nIf all of the three observed spatial dimensions are relative transverse to a p-brane, the result\nmay be a braneworld scenario which globally breaks gravitational Lorentz invariance, while\nspatial rotational invariance is maintained.\n\n2.1\n\nBraneworld from NS1/D2 system\n\nOne way to achieve this is to add a pp-wave along the worldvolume of a D3-brane in type\nIIB theory. The near-horizon limit of the solution then becomes K5 \u00d7 S 5 , where K5 is the\ngeneralized Kaigorodov metric in D = 5, and the geometry is dual to a conformal field\n5\n\nThe delta-function domain-wall source due to the imposed\n\nin a dual quantum field theory.\n\n3\n\nZ2 symmetry provides an ultra-violet cut-off\n\n\ftheory in the infinite momentum frame [13]. T-dualizing along the direction of the pp-wave\nresults in the NS1/D2 system of type IIA theory. The corresponding metric is given by\n\u22123/4\n\nds210 = H1\n\n\u22125/8\n\nH2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2212 dt2 + H2 dx21 + H1 (dx22 + dx23 ) + H1 H2 (dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a925 ) ,\n\nwhere\nH1 = 1 +\n\nR14\n,\nr4\n\nR24\n,\nr4\n\nH2 = 1 +\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\nand R1 and R2 are the charges of the NS1 and D2 brane, respectively.

We use the following metric Ansatz for dimensional reduction over S n\nds2D = e\u22122\u03b1\u03c6 ds2d + g \u22122 e\nwhere \u03b1 = \u2212\n\nq\n\nn\n2(D\u22122)(d\u22122) .\n\n2(d\u22122)\n\u03b1\u03c6\nn\n\nd\u03a92n ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nReducing over S 5 in (2.3) using the Ansatz (2.5) we obtain\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds25 = (1 + k|z|)\u22122/3 \u2212 (1 + k|z|)\u22124 dt2 + dx2i + dz 2 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe fluctuations of the five-dimensional graviton satisfy the equation of a minimally-coupled\nscalar field in a gravitational background given by\n\u221a\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a6 = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nTaking \u03a6 = M (t, xi ) (1 + k|z|)3/2 \u03c8(z) we obtain a Schr\u00f6dinger-type wave equation,\n\u2212 \u2202z2 \u03c8 + V (z)\u03c8 = m2 \u03c8,\n4\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fwith an effective potential given by\nV (z) =\n\n15k2\n\u2212 3\u03b4(z).\n4(1 + k|z|)2\n\n(2.9)\n\n= m2 M (t, xi ),\n\n(2.10)\n\nNote that the mass m is defined by\n(4) M (t, xi )\n\nwhere\n\n(4)\n\nis the four-dimensional Laplacian.\n\nThe graviton wave equation (2.8) is the same as for a braneworld originating from the\nD3-brane near-horizon region, such as the original RS2 scenario. The massless graviton is\nlocalized on the braneworld, as can by seen by the fact that the corresponding wavefunction,\n\u03c8 = N (1 + k|z|)\u22123/2 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nis square-normalizable. The effective four-dimensional Newtonian potential is modified in\nthe same way, via the massive graviton modes, as for braneworld arising from a D3-brane.\nIn the present case, however, Lorentz invariance is globally broken, as can be seen from\nthe form of the metric (2.6). The speed of gravitons in the bulk is v(z) = (1 + k|z|)\u22122 ,\nwhere the speed of light on the braneworld is unity. Since v(z) decreases away from the\nbraneworld, the propagation of gravitons will not exhibit effects that appear to violate\ncausality. However, a Lorentz-violating effect, from the point of view of the braneworld, is\na modification of the dispersion relation, E 2 = m2 + c2 ~p2 , for which c now depends on the\nspread of the wave function in the extra dimension [9, 14, 15, 16].\nThe metric (2.6) is of the form (1.2) where b(z) \u2212\u2192 0 as |z| \u2212\u2192 \u221e. In addition, V (z)\ngiven by (2.9) tends to a constant for large |z|. This implies that the massless graviton is\n\nnow quasi-localized for p~ 2 > 0, that is, metastable against escape into the extra dimension.\nIn particular, the escape width \u0393(|~\np|) increases with |~\np| [17]. This is true also for massless\nparticles other than the graviton, provided that the corresponding fields have bulk modes.\nThis type of metastability may have phenomenological consequences, especially for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays [14, 18, 19].\n\n2.2\n\nOther examples\n\nWe find similar results if we add a pp-wave to the worldvolume of a D4 or D5-brane and\nthen T-dualize the solution. In the case of a D4-brane with a pp-wave, T-dualizing along\nthe direction of the wave yields the NS1/D3 system of type IIB theory. Note that this is\ndual to the type IIA D2/D2 system, by lifting up to eleven dimensions and the reducing\nalong a different direction.

However,\nas previously mentioned, the dispersion relation is modified and the massless graviton is\nquasi-localized.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nBraneworld from M5-brane with C-field\n\nConsider the M5-brane solution with a constant C-field [20]:\nds211 = K 1/3 H 1/3\n\n\u00101\n\nH\n\n(\u2212dt2 + dx24 + dx25 ) +\n\nH =1+\n\nR3\n,\nr3\n\n\u0011\n1 2\ndxi + dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a924 ,\nK\n\nK = sin2 \u03b8 + cos2 \u03b8 H,\n\n(3.1)\n\ndC(3) = sin \u03b8 dH \u22121 \u2227 dt \u2227 dx4 \u2227 dx5 + 3R3 \u03a9(4) cos \u03b8 \u2212 6 tan \u03b8 dK \u22121 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 ,\nwhere i = 1, 2, 3. This can be interpreted as a 2-brane lying within a 5-brane [21]. In the\nnear-horizon region we can neglect the \"1\" in H\n\n6.\n\nReducing over S 4 , x4 and x5 yields a\n\nfive-dimensional domain wall with the metric\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds25 = (1 + k|z|)\u221210/3 [cos2 \u03b8 + sin2 \u03b8 (1 + k|z|)\u22126 ](\u2212dt2 + dz 2 ) + dx2i ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere r/R = (1 + k|z|)\u22122 . Taking \u03a6 = M (t, xi )(1 + k|z|)5/2 \u03c8(z), we find that the graviton\nequation of motion can be expressed as\n\u2212 \u2202z2 \u03c8 +\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nsin2 \u03b8 \u0011\n35k2\n2\n2\n\u2212\n5k\n\u03b4(z)\n\u03c8\n=\nm\ncos\n\u03b8\n+\n\u03c8.\n4(1 + k|z|)2\n(1 + k|z|)6\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe massless case coincides with the braneworld scenario arising from the near-horizon\nof a D4-brane or M5-brane without a C-field, given by (2.13) and studied in [12]. The\ngraviton speed decreases away from the braneworld, so we would not observe causality\nviolations induced by bulk gravitational propagation. However, as with the intersecting\np-brane origins discussed in the previous section, the dispersion relation is modified and the\nmassless graviton is quasi-localized.\n\n4\n\nBraneworld from non-extremal p-brane\n\nThe gravitational breaking of Lorentz invariance may correspond to a perturbation away\nfrom extremality in the higher-dimensional p-brane origin of the braneworld scenario. A\ncase that is tractable with semi-analytical methods [22] is the 5-brane solution of heterotic\nor type II theories, whose metric is given by\nds210 = H \u22121/4 (\u2212f dt2 + dx2j ) + H 3/4 (f \u22121 dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a923 ),\nwhere\nH =1+\n6\n\nR2\n,\nr2\n\nf =1\u2212\n\ne2 R2\n,\nr2\n\nIn this decoupling limit, a holographic dual theory would be non-associative.\n\n7\n\n(4.1)\n\n(4.2)\n\n\f1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.002\n\n0.004 0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\nFigure 1: |\u03c8(z = 0)|2 versus m/k for e = .005, .01, .015, .02, .025, .03, and .035\nand j = 1, .., 5. The non-extremality parameter is e. We suppose that the brane is perturbed\nslightly from extremality so that e \u226a 1. In the near-horizon region we can neglect the \"1\"\nin H, and the metric (4.1) can be expressed as\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds210 = (e\u2212k|z| + e2 )1/4 f (\u2212dt2 + dz 2 ) + dx2j + R2 d\u03a923 ,\nwhere r/R =\n\n(4.3)\n\np\n\ne\u2212k|z| + e2 . Reducing this region of the 5-brane metric on T 2 \u00d7 S 3 with the\n\nAnsatz (2.5) yields a five-dimensional domain wall with the metric\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds25 = (e\u2212k|z| + e2 )2/3 (1 + e2 ek|z| )\u22121 (\u2212dt2 + dz 2 ) + dx2i ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2, 3. The speed of gravitons in the bulk is v(z) = (1 + e2 ek|z| )\u22121 . Since\nv(z) decreases away from the braneworld, this scenario will not exhibit characteristics that\nwould appear to violate causality from the four-dimensional perspective. However, as we\nshall see, one consequence of the global breaking of Lorentz invariance is that the effective\nfour-dimensional graviton is now a quasi-localized massive state. Considering a graviton\nfluctuation which obeys the equation of motion for a minimally-coupled scalar given by\n(2.7), we take \u03a6 = (e\u2212k|z| + e2 )\u22121/2 M (t, xi )\u03c8(z).

For\nthe massless mode, this reduces to a Schr\u00f6dinger-type wave equation with the solution given\nby\n\u03c8 = N (e2 + e\u2212k|z| )1/2 .\n8\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fFor the extremal case, this solution is square-normalizable and the massless graviton is\ntherefore bound to the braneworld [12]. Away from extremality, the solution diverges for\nlarge z and is no longer physical. However, there is a quasi-localized massive graviton mode,\nwhose mass increases away from extremality. This is illustrated numerically in Figure 2, by\na massive resonance on the braneworld. Notice that the wave function dissipates further\naway from the extremal case, which implies a decrease in the distance that the massive\ngraviton propagates on the braneworld before escaping into the extra dimension.\n\n5\n\nBraneworld from global AdS5\n\nThe RS2 braneworld model used a warped five-dimensional metric that could be identified\nas a slice of AdS5 . Albeit the imposed Z2 symmetry, this can be obtained from the nearhorizon region of the D3-brane reduced over S 5 .\nConsider the metric for AdS5 expressed in global coordinates, which is given by\nds25 = \u2212cosh2 \u03c1 dt2 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1 dx2i .\n\n(5.1)\n\nImposing Z2 symmetry about z we can express (5.1) as\nds25 =\n\n1\n(\u2212cosh2 (1 + k|z|)dt2 + dx2i + dz 2 ),\nsinh (1 + k|z|)\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere sinh \u03c1 = 1/sinh(1 + k|z|).\nWe shall show that there is a massless graviton mode localized on the braneworld. We\ninsert the graviton wavefunction \u03a6 = \u03c6(z)M (t, xi ) into (2.7) for the background given by\n(5.2) and find the radial wave equation to be\n\u2212\n\nsinh3 (1 + k|z|) cosh(1 + k|z|)\n\u2202z\n\u2202z \u03c6 = m2 \u03c6,\ncosh(1 + k|z|) sinh3 (1 + k|z|)\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere m is defined as in the previous sections. With the wave function transformation\n\u03c6=\n\n\u0010 cosh(1 + k|z|) \u0011\u22121/2\n\nsinh3 (1 + k|z|)\n\n\u03c8,\n\n(5.4)\n\nthe wave equation (5.3) can be expressed in Schr\u00f6dinger form,\n\u2212 \u2202z2 \u03c8 + V (z)\u03c8 = m2 \u03c8,\nwith\nV (z) =\n\n4 sinh4 (1 + k|z|) + 20 sinh2 (1 + k|z|) + 15 2\nk \u2212 \u03b1 k \u03b4(z),\nsinh2 (2(1 + k|z|))\n9\n\n(5.5)\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fwhere \u03b1 = 2(2sinh2 (1)+3)/sinh(2). This is a volcano-type potential. That is, the coefficient\nof the delta-function term is negative, and the k2 term is maximum at z = 0 and decreases\nto V (z \u2192 \u221e) = k2 . The latter property indicates that there is a mass gap of Mgap = k\nseparating the localized massless state from the massive modes which propagate in the extra\ndimension 7 .\nThe massless wavefunction solution is given by\n\u03c8=N\n\ns\n\ncosh(1 + k|z|)\n,\nsinh3 (1 + k|z|)\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere N is the normalization constant. Since this wavefunction is square normalizable, it\ncorresponds to a localized massless graviton state.\nIn order to see if the original RS2 scenario can arise within a certain limit of the present\nbraneworld scenario, we re-express the metric for global AdS5 (5.1) via the coordinate\ntransformation sinh \u03c1 = 1/sinh(\u03b3 + k|z|). Rather than setting \u03b3 = 1, we consider the case\nwhere \u03b3 is a small constant. In the limit \u03b3 + k|z| \u226a 1, the geometry asymptotes to a local\nslice of AdS5 . Therefore, in the vicinity of our braneworld, we expect the physics to be\nsimilar to that of the original RS2 scenario. Indeed, in this limit with \u03b3 replacing the \"1\"\nin the massless graviton wavefunction, (5.7) reduces to \u03c8 = N (\u03b1 + k|z|)\u22123/2 , which is the\nmassless wavefunction for the RS2 scenario for this particular choice of coordinates.\nFurther away from the braneworld, the present scenario differs quite drastically from\nthe RS2 scenario. This is demonstrated by the speed of gravitons in the bulk, which\nis v(z) = cosh(1 + k|z|)/cosh(1), after a rescaling of t. Since v(z) increases away from\nthe braneworld, there is an apparent violation of causality. That is, as discussed in the\nIntroduction, gravitational disturbances may bend into the bulk and arrive at a particular\nlocation on the braneworld earlier than does the light from the same source.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have found that the breaking of global Lorentz invariance for a braneworld may stem\nfrom various M-theoretic causes. One possibility is that the spatial dimensions of a braneworld\ncorrespond to relative transverse dimensions in the near-horizon region of a system of intersecting p-branes. Another higher-dimensional origin is an M5-brane in a constant C-field.\nFor such braneworld scenarios, the massless graviton, and any other massless particle with\n7\n\nNote that (5.6) is the same graviton wave equation as for D3-branes distributed uniformly over a disc\n\n[23].\n\n10\n\n\fcorresponding bulk modes, is quasi-localized with an escape width which increases with\nmomentum. Such metastability may have phenomenological consequences, for example, for\nultra-high energy cosmic rays. As we discussed, another consequence in such a scenario is\na modification of the dispersion relation.\nWe next discussed the braneworld scenario which results from the near-horizon region\nof a p-brane that is perturbed away from extremality. In particular, we considered the\nsemi-analytically tractable example of a 5-brane in heterotic or type II theories. The global\nbreaking of Lorentz invariance in the corresponding braneworld gives rise to a quasi-localized\ngraviton which is massive. As the corresponding 5-brane is perturbed further from extremality, the mass of the quasi-bound state increases, and the graviton propagates for a decreasing\ndistance on the braneworld before escaping into the bulk. Another odd consequence, which\nwas discussed in [22], is the presence of quasi-bound massive harmonic states, which travel\na relatively short distance on the brane before escaping.\nWe considered a braneworld scenario which arises from global AdS5 . Unlike the case of a\nlocal patch of AdS5 , which was used in the original RS2 scenario, Lorentz invariance is globally broken on the brane since the speed of gravitons increases away from the braneworld.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, the result of this is that gravitons can travel from one\npoint of the braneworld to another by bending into the bulk, and thus arriving apparently\nfaster than light.\nIt seems that, in order to take the Penrose limit of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , AdS must be expressed in\n\nglobal coordinates.8 Therefore, there may be an interesting connection with the braneworld\nscenario arising from AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , for which AdS is in global coordinates. In taking this\n\nlimit, one considers particles traveling fast around a coordinate in S 5 . Therefore, one would\nneed to consider gravitational modes which move fast around S 5 [28].\n\nLastly, since this falls under the category of gravitational Lorentz violations from Mtheory, we would like to make mention that five-dimensional AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black\nholes have the ten-dimensional interpretation of spinning D3-branes [29]. This enables us to\nplace previous work on gravitational Lorentz violations within the context of ten dimensions\nand holography, in particular with regards to the Coulomb branch of the dual gauge theory.\nFuture work will elaborate on this point.\n8\n\nThis results in a background on which the type IIB light-cone string action is exactly solvable [24, 25,\n\n26, 27].\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Malcolm Fairbairn for helpful conversations on cosmological issues and\nto Don Marolf for a useful discussion on lightcone structures.
