Introduction\nThe ceria-supported Pt-Rh bimetallic catalysts have been found to be very effective\nthree-way catalysts for simultaneous elimination of the CO , NO and the hydrocarbons\nfrom automobile exhaust gases [1-3]. These catalysts are increasingly used globally in\nthe catalytic converters of automobiles. It is important, therefore, to have a thorough\nunderstanding of the structural, electronic and catalytic properties of these catalysts.\nIn this work , we present the results of our theoretical investigations on the composition\nprofile of unsupported Pt-Rh bimetallic nanostructures as a function of temperature\nand adsorbates.\nThe structural and catalytic properties of the Pt-Rh alloy surfaces have earlier been\nexhaustively studied by several groups [4-11]. Van Delft et al. [4] used AES to investigate the Pt62 Rh38 and Pt10 Rh90 alloy systems. They found a surface enrichment with\nPt for both the systems. When studied as a function of temperature this surface enrichment showed a maximum at about 1000 K for both the systems. This phenomenon\nwas explained in terms of a vibration entropy contribution to the enthalpy. Tsong et\nal. [5] made a layer-by-layer analysis of a Pt-Rh alloy tip at 1000 K to show that the\ntopmost layer is Pt-enriched and the second layer is Pt-depleted. The distribution of\nPt and Rh atoms depend on the annealing temperature. Hirano et al. [6] , on the\nother hand, showed that the presence of adsorbates like oxygen and/or nitric oxide has\na more pronounced effect on the chemical restructuring process of the Pt-Rh surface\nlayers than the annealing temperature. While there have been a large number of theoretical studies on this segregation phenomenon in clean and gas-covered alloy surfaces\n[4-7], the number of segregation studies for supported particles are comparatively few.\nSome theoretical investigations for Pt-Rh particles have been made by Strohl and King\n[8], Schoeb et al. [9] and Yang et al [10]. These works are based either on rigid-lattice\nMonte-Carlo (MC) simulations or on molecular dynamics / Monte-Carlo-correlated ef2\n\n\ffective medium theory, where the interaction energies were generated from a simplified\nversion of the non-selfconsistent electron-density-functional correlated effective medium\n(CEM) theory [11]. For the fcc cubo-octahedral particles the atomic distribution at\nthe corner, edge and fcc(100) and (111)-like faces were obtained as a function of the\nparticle size and composition. A shell-by-shell composition profile of the particles were\nnot, however, studied in these works. It is the main purpose of the present work to\ninvestigate the shell-wise composition of Pt-Rh nanoparticles as a function of temperature and adsorbate coverage. For the 2406 fcc cubo-octahedral Pt-Rh nanoparticles a\nMonte-Carlo simulation has been carried out to analyse the atomic distribution in top\nfew layers . We show that the presence of adsorbate like oxygen drastically changes\nthe composition profile, while the effect of temperature from 700K-1300 K on the composition profile is relatively much small. These studies are useful in understanding\nthe structure and catalytic properties of ceria-supported Pt-Rh catalysts used in the\ncatalytic converter . The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2, the theoretical\nmodel developed earlier and used in the present work is briefly outlined. The results\nfor clean and oxygen-adsorbed Pt-Rh nanoparticles are presented in section 3. The\nconclusions are drawn in section 4.\n2. Theoretical model\nThe theoretical model used in this work is the MC simulation technique employed\nelsewhere in connection with surface segregation in presence and in absence of adsorbed\nspecies[12-16]. One determines the pair-bond energy between two nearest neighbour\natoms Eij in the form\n\nEij = wij /Z + Eci (n)/n + Ecj (m)/m\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the indices i and j are the component metals A or B of the bimetallic system AB\n\n3\n\n\f; and wij is the interchange energy for two dissimilar atoms. wij = 0 if i = j and this\ninterchange energy is related to the excess heat of mixing. Z is the bulk coordination\nnumber. Eic (n) is the partial bond energy of the i-atom with n nearest neighbours etc.\nUsually, the coordination-dependent partial bond energy , Ec i (n) ( for n = 2 - 12), is\ncalculated from an empirical formula like\n\nEci (n) = ai + bi n + ci n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ai , bi and ci are adjustable constants that can be derived from experimental data\nof dimer energy , surface energy and the cohesive energy of a metal corresponding to\nn=2, 8 and 12 respectively. Once the pair binding energy Eij is evaluated it is the usual\nMC procedure to compute the configuration energy for a particular distribution of A\nand B atoms in the nanoparticle. And from various such distributions an equilibrium\ndistribution may be found giving the shell-wise occupation of sites by A or B atoms. In\npresence of adsorbates, there are additional energy terms to describe the chemisorptive\nbond and the concomitant metal-metal pair-bond energy variations. King and Donnelly\n[12] showed that since in Monte-Carlo simulations only the differences in energies are\ncalculated, it is sufficient to add the difference in chemisorption energy of the adsorbate\non the two metals to the configuration energy. This has been done in this work to study\nthe role of adsorbed oxygen on the composition profile.\n3. Results and Discussions\nWe are interested in the composition profile of the outer shells of the Pt-Rh nanoparticles since it is only the outer shells which are important in catalysis and can be\ninfluenced by adsorbed atoms. For convenience, we avoid the usual description of shell\nstructure where the shells are constructed by atoms equidistant from the centre. As\nmay be found from the work of Yang and DePristo [10] that to describe a 200-atom\n\n4\n\n\ffcc cubo-octahedral particle one needs 11 shells. This concept may be very useful for\ndescribing the stability and morphological structure of a nanoparticle. However, for a\nlarge fcc cubo-octahedron particle of 2406 atoms as considered in this work this description would require a large number of shells which is very difficult to handle. In\nour treatment , the outermost shell (we also call it 'top shell') comprises all the atoms\nat the corner sites, bridge sites, fcc(100) and fcc(111)-type faces. The total number of\nsuch atoms is 752. If we peel off these atoms from the outermost shell, the second shell\nwould be exposed to the adsorbed gases. The number of atoms in the second shell\nis 582. In this way, we may have just eight shells with total number of atoms in the\nshells ( counting from the outermost shell inward) as 752, 582, 432, 302, 192, 102, 38\nand 6 respectively. The number of Pt and Rh atoms are counted in each shell and the\nfraction of these atoms in the shells are calculated. In this work we have calculated\nthe fraction of Pt and Rh atoms for a bulk Pt50 Rh50 particle.\nThe values of the parameters used for the present MC simulation are the following:\nPt: a = -0.4287398, b = -0.0474969, c = 0.0035483 , Ead (O) = 85 kcals/mole\nRh: a = -0.4744544, b = - .0341727, c = 0.0028138 , Ead (O) = 102 kcals/mole\nand wij /Z = -0.00691 eV. Ead (O) is the chemisorption energy of oxygen atom on the\nmetal.\nWe have calculated the composition profile for T = 700 K, 1000 K and 1300 K. The\nstudies at T = 700 K is of particular importance since the exhaust temperature at\nthe three-way catalyst is of this order. To study the effect of adsorbed gases we have\nconsidered one coverage ( = 0.25 ) of adsorbed oxygen. This is because it is the presence\nor absence of oxygen that controls the CO oxidation and NO reduction in three-way\ncatalysts. The calculation , however, can easily be repeated for other coverages and\nother adsorbed gases . The present work attempts to study the qualitative change of\ncomposition profile as a function of temperature and adsorbate coverage.\n5\n\n\fFigure 1 shows the % of Pt atoms in top four shells. The top shell ( shell number 1)\ncorresponds to the surface layer and shows Pt-enrichment for all the three temperatures;\nwhile the second and third shell shows Pt-depletion for the three temperatures. The\nno segregation line is represented by the dots. The behaviour from shell number 4 to\nhigher ( moving towards the core of the particle ) is divergent. However, for surface\nand catalytic properties the top 2-3 shells are of real interest since they constitute the\nsurface layers . Besides, the top shell for a 2406-atom particle represents 31% of total\natoms, sometimes known as dispersion; while the top 2 , top 3 and top 4 shells represent\n55% , 73% and 86% of total atoms for this particle respectively. If we compute the %\nof Pt atoms averaged over top 2, top 3 and top 4 shells, the results would be as shown\nin Figure 2. The results are computed for all the three temperatures. The results\naveraged over all the eight shells would ,of course, be the bulk Pt concentration which\nis 50%. This is why all the curves meet at shell number 8. It may be noted that for T\n= 700 K the top shell is Pt-enriched; but the averages over top 2, top 3 and top 4 shells\nshow Pt-depletion. For T = 1000 K and 1300 K, however, the averages over top 2, top\n3 and top 4 shells show Pt-enrichment. This signifies that the properties, that depend\non the composition of the top shell only, would not change with temperature, since the\nshell is Pt-enriched. However, the properties that depend on the average composition\nof top 2 , top 4 or top 4 shells will change with temperature. In Figure 3 we plot the\nsame shell-averaged Pt concentration as a function of temperature. In addition to the\nfeatures described above for Figure 2, an important feature becomes obvious in figure 3.\nIt is that the Pt-enrichment shows a maximum at T = 1000 K. This result agrees very\nwell with the experimental findings of Van delft et al. [4] for the polycrystalline alloy\nsurface. The authors [4] explained this behaviour with a surface segregation model\ncontaining both enthalpy and vibrational entropy contribution. It is likely that for\nthe present system of nano-sized Pt-Rh particles also the entropy contribution may\n6\n\n\fbe responsible for the temperature dependence of surface segregation. In Figure 4\nwe plot the % of Pt atoms in presence of 0.25 monolayer of adsorbed oxygen and\ncompare them with the results for clean system, shown already in Figure 1. It may\nbe noticed that the presence of 0.25 monolayer of oxygen has a very strong effect on\nthe composition of the top shell as well as on other shells. Because of higher binding\nenergy of oxygen on Rh compared to that on Pt the Rh atoms are pulled to the top\nshell at all the three temperatures. This segregation is so strong that the rest of the\nshells of the particle become Pt-enriched. On comparing the effect of temperature and\nadsorbates on the shell composition it may be noted from Figure 4 that the effect of\ntemperature on the composition profile is mild. This is obvious from the spreadth of\nthe composition for three temperatures in both the clean and adsorbed cases. However,\nthe large separation of the two sets of curves ( each set consisting of the results for\nthree temperature), one for the clean case and the other for the oxygen-adsorbed case,\nsignifies that the effect of adsorbates is much stronger on the composition. We believe,\nthese results can be exploited in the three-way catalyst where Rh acts as the main\ncomponent in reducing NO. Furthermore, it may be mentioned that the present study\nconsiders one bulk composition and one coverage of one adsorbed species. This may be\nrepeated for other compositions, adsorbates and coverages as the situation demands.\n4. Conclusions\nA Monte-Carlo procedure has been utilised to compute the atomic composition of a\nPt-Rh nanoparticle in the form of shells gradually peeled off from the outer layer.\nThe composition profile correctly predicts Pt segregation in the top layer ; but the\nvariation of the composition of the outer shells with temperature is small. In contrast,\nthe variation of the composition of the shells with presence of adsorbed oxygen is very\nlarge.\n\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K. C.
