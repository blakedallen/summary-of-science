The breakup cross sections in the reaction 6 He+12 C are calculated\nat about 40 MeV/nucleon using the high-energy approximation (HEA) and with\nthe help of microscopic optical potentials (OP) of interaction with the target\nnucleus 12 C of the projectile nucleus fragments 4 He and 2n. Considering the\ndi-neutron h=2n as a single particle the relative motion h\u03b1 wave function is estimated so that to explain both the separation energy of h in 6 He and the rms radius of the latter. The stripping and absorbtion total cross sections are calculated\nand their sum is compared with the total reaction cross section obtained within a\ndouble-folding microscopic OP for the 6 He+12 C scattering. It is concluded that\nthe breakup cross sections contribute in about 50% of the total reaction cross\nsection.\n\nIntroduction\nIn recent calculations [1], the data on elastic scattering of 6 He on 12 C at comparably large energies 38.3 and 41.6 MeV/nucleon [2], [3] were studied using\nthe microscopic optical potentials (OP) [4], whose depths of real and imaginary\nparts as well as the strength of the surface term were corrected by the three fitted\nre-normalization coefficients NR , NI and Nsf\nI . It was shown that because of the\nlimited set of experimental data the ill-posed problem reveals itself, and therefore not one but the number of sets of adjusted N's (and the respective OP's)\nwere obtained, each characterized by fairly small \u03c72 value. In this connection,\nthe study of physics of the process is desirable, namely the search of details of\nmechanism of the 6 He+12 C interaction in different channels. At this stage we\nintend to study constituents of a total reaction cross section \u03c3R , the breakup \u03c3b\nand absorption \u03c3a cross section, and compare them with \u03c3R obtained with the\nhelp of the aforementioned OP's in elastic channel.\n1 The model of 6 He\nWe consider the simplest breakup h\u03b1-model of 6 He, where it is suggested consisting of two clusters 4 He and h, the correlated pair of neutrons h=2n (the sim1\n\n\fE.V. Zemlyanaya, V.K. Lukyanov, K.V. Lukyanov\nilar model was also treated in [3]). The interaction between clusters is taken\nto be a WS potential with the adjusted geometrical parameters R = 1.45 f m,\na = 0.3 f m and the depth V0 = 28.3 M ev that reproduces the separation energy \u03b5 = 0.975M eV of h and yields the rrms radius 2.62 f m of 6 He. The\nobtained s-wave function \u03c6b (s) of relative motion of clusters defines the density\ndistribution\n\u033ab (s) = |\u03c6b (s)|2 = (1/4\u03c0)|\u03c6l=0 (s)|2\n(1)\nand will be used for the further calculations of the ground state matrix elements of breakup processes. Figure 1 exhibits that \u033ab (r), normalized to 1, coincides fairly well with \u033aL (s), the nucleon density distribution of 6 He obtained\nwithin the known large-scale shell-model [5] (LSSM-model) which also gives\nrrms = 2.586 f m. Thus, we may apply the 2-cluster h\u03b1-model for the further\ncalculations of elastic and breakup cross sections.\n2 Folding potentials\nIn the framework of the h\u03b1-model of 6 He one can estimate the 6 He+12 C OP as\nfolding of two OP's of interaction of clusters \u03b1 and h with 12 C:\n(b)\n\nUHeC (r) = V DF (b)n + iW (b) =\n\u0001o\n\u0001\nR\n=\n= d3 s \u033ab (s) U\u03b1 r \u2212 (2/3)s + Uh r + (1/3)s\n\u001a \u0010\n\u0011\n\u221e\n1\np\nR\nR\nr2 + (1/9)s2 \u2212 r(2/3)sx +\n= 2\u03c0 \u033ab (s)s2 ds dx U\u03b1\n0\n\u22121\n\u0010p\n\u0011\u001b\n+ Uh\nr2 + (4/9)s2 + r(4/3)sx\n.\n\n(2)\n\nHere the h-12 C potential is taken as the twice neutron-12C OP Uh = 2Un . In\nturn, potentials U\u03b1 and Un are calculated within the microscopic hybrid model\nof OP [4]. In the latter, the double-folding (DF) real part V DF is constructed as\nis done in [6], [7], while the imaginary part is derived using the optical limit of\na Glauber theory. So, the real and imaginary parts of OP are as follows:\nZ\nn\nD\nV DF (r) = V D (r) + V EX (r) = d3 sp d3 st \u033ap (sp ) \u033at (st ) vN\nN (s) +\nh\ns io\nEX\nd3 sp d3 st \u033ap (sp , sp + s) \u033at (st , st \u2212 s)vN\n, (3)\nN (s) exp iK(r) *\nM\nZ \u221e\n1 E\nj0 (qr)\u033ap (q)\u033at (q)fN (q)q 2 dq.\n(4)\nW H (r) = \u2212 2 \u03c3\u0304N\n2\u03c0 k\n0\nHere p and t are related to the projectile and target nucleus, s = r+st \u2212sp , M =\nAp At /(Ap + At ), K(r) is the local nucleus-nucleus momentum, and \u03c3\u0304N ,the\ntotal NN cross section, averaged over the isospins of colliding nuclei. The current calculations apply the vN N effective Paris nucleon-nucleon CDM3Y6 potentials (for details see in [6], [7]).

In this case, there were applied two kinds of OP, with\nimaginary parts W=WH (b) and W=VDF (b) , and the corresponding differential\ncross sections were numerically calculated using the code DWUCK4 [9]. Besides, we compare these results with cross sections given in [1] where the entire\ndouble-folding OP (3) was utilized accounting for the LSSM density for 6 He [5],\nand for the 12 C density from [8].

Also,\nFig.3 shows the resulting 6 He+12 C optical potentials, that correspond to the case\nof selection of the HEA ImOP (4) used in the h\u03b1-model and in the entire DFmodel. One sees that the ImOP for both models are rather similar. Nevertheless,\nwe note that the sharper slope in the periphery of the h\u03b1-model OP's leads to\nthe pronounced angular distributions as compared to those calculated within the\nsmooth DF-potential based on the 6 He LSSM density. As a whole the h\u03b1-model\nof 6 He seems to be reliable for the further evaluations of total breakup cross\nsections, that is the subject of our study in the paper.\n4 Testing the HEA(eikonal) method\nFor calculations of breakup cross sections, the analytic eikonal (HEA) method is\nutilized. As to our further applications of HEA approach at energies of about 40\nMeV/nucleon we should preliminary verify that this method is well working. For\nthis purpose we calculate the notably characteristic of a process, the differential\ncross section of the 6 He+12 C elastic scattering at 38.3 MeV/nucleon, within the\nnumerical code DWUCK4 and also using the HEA method. In both cases we apply the same microscopic double-folding OP U opt = (1.123 + i0.472)V DF (r)\nfrom [1]. For this OP the exact result for the angular distribution was already\nshown in Fig.2 by the dashed-dotted curve. As to the analogical eikonal calculations we first exhibit the explicit expression for the HEA amplitude of scattering\n(for details see ref.

One can see that both curves coincide fairly well, especially at\nsmall angles, in the region that yields the main contribution to the total cross\nsections. Thus we conclude that the HEA method may be applied for our further\nestimations of the total breakup cross sections.\n5 The HEA model for breakup reactions\nThe earlier HEA theory for the breakup processes were developed in refs. [11],\n[12] for investigations of stripping and dissociation of deuterons in nuclear col6\n\n\fEstimation of the breakup cross sections in 6 He+12 C...\nlisions. In recent papers (see, e.g., [13], [14] and refs therein) this method was\ngeneralized to study breakup reactions of lightest nuclei. For a brief review of\nthis method we begin with the conditions E \u226b |U |, \u03b8 \u226a (1/kR)1/2 when\nthe OP wave function of a high-energy particle can be considered in the eikonal\nform:\nZ z\n\u0010p\n\u0011\ni\nb2 + z 2\nikr \u2212\ndz U opt\n~v \u2212\u221e\n\u03a8(r) = e\n,\n(9)\nAfter scattering at z\u2192 +\u221e this function becomes\nZ \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010p\ni\nb2 + z 2\ndz U opt\n\u2212\n,\n\u03a8(r) = S(b) * eikr ,\nS(b) = e ~v \u2212\u221e\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S(b) is an analog of the partial Sl -matrix, and formulae defined by Sl may\nbe transformed\nexpressions with S(b) using relations l + 1/2 \u2192 kb\nR\nP to respective\nand (1/k) l \u2192 db. So, after the collision the probability that the particle\nwith an impact parameter b remains in the elastic channel is\nZ \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n2\n\u2212\nb2 + z 2\ndz Wi\n|Si (b)|2 = e ~v 0\n,\ni = \u03b1, h,\n(11)\nand the probability for the particle to be removed from the elastic channel is\n(1 \u2212 |S|2 ). (Here we denote W = |ImU |.) Thus, the common probability of\nboth h and \u03b1 particles to leave the elastic channel is (1 \u2212 |Sh |2 )(1 \u2212 |S\u03b1 |2 ).\nThen, one should average this latter by \u033ab (s) that characterizes the probability\nof h and \u03b1 to be at relative distance s. As a result, for the h\u03b1-model of 6 He the\ntotal absorbtion cross section is obtained as follows\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\ntot\n(12)\nbh dbh 1 \u2212 |Sh (bh )|2 (1 \u2212 I(bh )) ,\n\u03c3abs\n= 2\u03c0\n0\n\nwhere\nI(bh ) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 s\u033ab (s)|S\u03b1 (b\u03b1 )|2 ,\n\nb\u03b1 =\n\nq\ns2 sin2 \u03b8 + b2h \u2212 2sbh sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6\n\n(13)\nHere the relation is used of impact parameters b\u03b1 = bh \u2212 b with b = s sin \u03b8\nbeing the projection of the h \u2212 \u03b1 vector s on the plane normal to the 0z-axis\nalong the straight line trajectory of an incident nucleus.\nIn the case of the stripping reaction with removing h-particle from 6 He to the target nucleus, one should use the probability of h to leave the elastic channel (1 \u2212\n|Sh (bh )|2 ), and for \u03b1 to continue its elastic scattering with probability |S\u03b1 (b\u03b1 )|2 .\nThen the probability of the whole process is |S\u03b1 (b\u03b1 )|2 * (1 \u2212 |Sh (bh )|2 ), and to\nget the total stripping cross section one must average over \u033ab (s) as is done in\n(12),(13). In a similar manner the transfer of the \u03b1 particle can be constructed,\n7\n\n\fE.V. Zemlyanaya, V.K. Lukyanov, K.V. Lukyanov\nTable 2.

Firstly, we treated them as the NI Wh,\u03b1\npotential\ndone by eq.(4) of HEA, and also, in the other attempt, they were taken in the\ndouble-folding form NI V DF eq.(3) usually used for the real potentials. The renormalization coefficients {NI } are the same as they were fitted for the folded\npotentials (2) of the h\u03b1 model (Table 1, rows 2,3). Thereafter the respective\nprobabilities of scattering |Sh,\u03b1 |2 (11) were obtained and applied in calculations\nof the respective cross sections (12),(14),(15) shown in Table 2. One can see\ntot\nthat in this case the total reaction cross sections \u03c3R\n= 804, 830 mb turn out to\ntot\nbe about 20% lower than those \u03c3R = 1018, 1042 mb obtained within the code\n(b)\nDWUCK4 for the UHeC optical potential (2), the result of folding the Uh and\nU\u03b1 potentials with the h\u03b1-density function \u033ab (s). This 20% difference seems\nnot too large, but to get the more substantial conclusion one should make comparisons of results forfolded OPs calculated not within the code DWUCK4 but\nusing the eikonal expression for the total reaction cross section [11]\n\u001a\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0010p\n\u0011\u0015\u001b\n2\ntot\nb2 + z 2\ndz W\n.\n(16)\n\u03c3R\n= 2\u03c0\nbdb 1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n~v \u2212\u221e\n0\nOne should underline that here it is involved only the imaginary parts W of\n(b)\nthe UHeC optical potential (2), in our case they are W = 1.7W H and W =\n8\n\n\fEstimation of the breakup cross sections in 6 He+12 C...\ntot\n1.0V DF . So, using (16) we got the respective reaction cross sections \u03c3R\n= 952\nand 965 mb. Thus, the difference of these results from the preceding HEA results\ntot\n\u03c3R\n= 804 and 830 mb is only about 10%. The small rest discrepancy can arise\ndue to the additional role of the real part of OP in the DWUCK calculations,\nwhile the HEA expression (16) depends only on the imaginary part of OP. The\nother effect is ought to the difference in formulae (15) and (16). Indeed, in the\nfirst one the density \u033ab folds in eq.(13) probability function |Sh,\u03b1 |2 having the\nbare potential W in the exponent. Otherwise, the cross section (16) contains the\nalready folded potential in its exponent. By the way these effects occur to be not\ntoo significant, and one can conclude that the main mechanism of the absorbtion\nin elastic channel of the 6 He+12 C scattering is ought to existence of the power\ndissociation channels of the 6 He in two clusters h = 2n and \u03b1.\nAcknowledgments.
