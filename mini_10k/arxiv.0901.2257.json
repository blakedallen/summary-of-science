In spite of its\nformidable achievements, a number of longstanding challenges are still to be resolved. Perhaps the\nmost paradigmatic one concerns the ultimate nature of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB).\nEven though the Higgs mechanism provides an elegant description of EWSB within a perturbative\nquantum field theory framework, one is forced to postulate the existence of (at least) one scalar\n(J P = 0+ ) fundamental building-block of Nature, whose experimental confirmation is conspicuously missing for the time being. Nevertheless, with the recent start-up of the LHC operations\nat CERN, the prospects for the discovery of the Higgs boson are extremely encouraging and the\ncurtains may soon be drawn back to reveal this final player in the story of the SM. In fact, the\nLHC will be able to amply sweep the natural SM Higgs mass range (spanning from a few hundred\nGeV up to \u223c 1 TeV) and, in the most favorable scenarios, it could produce a copious number of\nHiggs boson events [1].\nDespite these optimistic prospects for the discovery of the SM Higgs boson, the upcoming\nLHC data might well reveal that the ultimate origin of EWSB is grounded somewhere beyond the\nminimal assumptions of the SM. For instance, a number of well-motivated (perturbative) extensions\nof the SM entail a two-Higgs-doublet structure, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM) [2] or the general (unconstrained) Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) [3]. From\nthe beginning, however, the quest for experimental signatures of Higgs boson physics beyond the\nSM concentrated its efforts mainly on the search for supersymmetric (SUSY) Higgs bosons [2,3]\u2013\nsee [4] for more recent developments, and [5] for fresh reviews of this subject. At the same time,\nvery detailed investigations were undertaken in the past on the SUSY quantum effects on the\ngauge boson masses [6] (cf. [7] for the current state of the art) and on the Z-boson and top quark\nwidths [8], in which virtual Higgs bosons may also play a significant role. Later on, outstanding\nnew sources of quantum corrections were identified in processes involving Higgs bosons, quarks\nand/or squarks as external particles. The possible new effects stemmed from the enhancement\ncapabilities associated to the supersymmetric Yukawa couplings between Higgs bosons and quarks\nor between quarks, squarks and chargino-neutralinos. In a variety of quite different processes, the\npotential effects were shown to be truly spectacular, see e.g. [9\u201312]. More recently, it has been\nshown that such an enhancement also applies to the loop-generated Yukawa couplings of additional\ngauge-singlet Higgs bosons in minimal extensions of the MSSM [13].\nSo far so good, but what about the non-SUSY Higgs boson extensions of the SM? Remarkably,\nthe crucial novelty here is that the most relevant effects could have an origin fundamentally different\nfrom the Yukawa couplings linked to the traditional SUSY sources of enhancement. This possibility\nhas recently been illustrated for the general 2HDM in [14] (see also [15] in a different domain). In\nthis letter, we dwell on another compelling (and complementary) example of this fact, which we\nencounter once more in the physics of the Higgs boson self-couplings at linear colliders. Assuming\nthat the LHC uncovers a neutral Higgs boson, a critical issue will be to discern whether this\nparticle is compatible with the SM and/or any of its extensions and, in the latter case, to which of\nthese extensions it belongs. The next generation of TeV-class linear colliders (based on both e+e\u2212\nand \u03b3\u03b3 collisions), such as the ILC and CLIC projects [16], will be invaluable in answering this\nfundamental question. Owing to its extremely clean environment, a linear collider should allow for\nprecise measurements of: i) the Higgs boson mass (or masses, if more than one); ii) the couplings\n2\n\n\fof the Higgs bosons to quarks, leptons and gauge bosons; and iii) the Higgs boson self-couplings\nmentioned above, i.e. the trilinear (3H) and quartic (4H) Higgs boson self-interactions. In a\nnutshell, it should allow us a keen insight into the physics lying beneath the EWSB mechanism\nand, ultimately, to reconstruct the Higgs potential itself.\nIn this work, we provide some complementary clues to this reconstruction process: specifically,\nwe focus on the effects of the trilinear Higgs boson couplings on the inclusive production of Higgs\nboson pairs induced by weak gauge boson fusion, i.e. e+e\u2212 \u2192 V \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 h h + X, where V = W \u00b1 , Z\nand h = h0, H0, A0 , H\u00b1 . We show that this mechanism could be the leading Higgs boson production\nchannel at TeV energies and, if so, it should furnish an intrinsic and totally unambiguous signal of\nnon-supersymmetric new physics. Therefore, while the physics of the top (and bottom) quark [17]\nis the natural playground for the study of the SM and MSSM Higgs boson interactions, we find\nthat in the case of non-SUSY theories there are comparable (if not better) opportunities in sectors\nof the theory not necessarily related to heavy quark flavors but to the very structure of the Higgs\npotential.\n\n2\n\nHiggs boson production induced by trilinear Higgs interactions\n\nOf cardinal importance is to understand in detail the phenomenology of the Higgs sector in the\ncontext of linear colliders (both within the SM and its renormalizable generalizations). Quite an\neffort has already been devoted to this goal in the literature. Exclusive double (2H) and multiple\nHiggs boson production, for instance, has been comprehensively investigated, although mainly\nwithin the MSSM [18\u201320]. The exclusive 2H case consists of the simplest Higgs boson production\nprocesses:\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 2H\n\n(2H \u2261 h0 A0; H0 A0; H+H\u2212) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nSimilarly, the two-body final states e+e\u2212 \u2192 Zh and e+e\u2212 \u2192 Ah (with h = h0 , H0) have been\nlong known to be complementary to each other in the MSSM [18]. Notice that processes with\nexclusively two identical neutral Higgs bosons in the final state cannot proceed at the tree-level\n(neither in the SM nor in the MSSM), and at one-loop they have very tiny cross-sections of order\n10\u22125 pb [14]. However, sizeable rates of two Higgs bosons in the final state in an e+e\u2212 collider\nmay arise from the processes like (2.1), whose detection would signify an unmistakable observation\nof physics beyond the SM. Nevertheless, let us highlight that none of the exclusive 2H channels\n(2.1) is sensible to the trilinear Higgs boson couplings at the leading order. Within such pairwise\nHiggs events, therefore, probing the structure of the 3H self-interactions would only be possible\nthrough the analysis of the radiative corrections. Indeed, one needs to include such quantum\neffects in the exclusive 2H boson processes (2.1) so as to disentangle the genuine imprints of a\nSUSY Higgs sector from a non-SUSY one. In this context, a rich literature exists on the one-loop\ncalculation of the cross-sections for the two-particle final states within the MSSM 1 . There are also\nstudies considering radiative corrections to charged Higgs production in e+e\u2212 collisions within the\n2HDM [25], and also on single, double and multiple Higgs production at the LHC but mostly\nfor the MSSM [26]. A complete 1-loop analysis of the exclusive 2H channels (2.1) in the general\n2HDM is missing, however, and will be presented elsewhere [27].\n1\n\nSee [21\u201323], and also the extensive report [24] and references therein.\n\n3\n\n\fOur main endeavor in this letter is to further investigate the foreseeable impact of these 3H\nself-couplings in a class of processes which critically depend on them already at the tree-level. This\nwas for instance the case of Ref. [14], in which the triple Higgs boson couplings were probed by\nperforming a systematic analysis of the exclusive production processes with three Higgs bosons in\nthe final state. There are three classes of processes of this kind compatible with CP-conservation,\nto wit:\n1) e+e\u2212 \u2192 H+H\u2212h ,\n\n2) e+e\u2212 \u2192 hhA0 ,\n\n3) e+e\u2212 \u2192 h0H0A0 ,\n\n(h = h0, H0, A0) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere, in class 2), we assume that the two neutral Higgs bosons h must be the same, i.e. the\nallowed final states are (h hA0) = (h0h0A0), (H0H0A0) and (A0A0A0). The cross-sections in the\n2HDM were shown in [14] to reach up to O(0.1) pb, i.e. several orders of magnitude over the\ncorresponding MSSM predictions [18]. Similar effects have also been recently reported in 2H\nstrahlung processes of the guise e+e\u2212 \u2192 Z0 h h [28], and also in the loop-induced 2H production\nthrough \u03b3\u03b3 interactions [29].\nIt is important to note that, in a CP-conserving theory, all the 3H final states in (2.2) contain\nat least one charged or pseudoscalar Higgs boson, and this has practical implications. In fact,\nlet us recall that there is an important distinction between the two basic types of generic 2HDM\nmodels [3]; namely, whilst light charged Higgs bosons are possible within a type-I 2HDM \u2013 in\nwhich only the \u03a62 field couples to fermions 2 \u2013, in type-II models there are important constraints\non the charged Higgs mass due to contributions to the flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC)\nprocess b \u2192 s\u03b3 [30, 31]. The Higgs pseudoscalar A0 is then also constrained to be relatively heavy\nMA \u223c MH \u00b1 , due to the limits on \u03b4\u03c1 \u2013 see e.g. Eq. (2.6) of Ref. [14].\nTriple Higgs boson couplings may drive different kinds of processes. The phenomenological\nimpact, however, may seriously depend on whether the underlying Higgs sector belongs to the\nMSSM or to the general 2HDM. In practice, this means that we should be ready to identify highly\ndistinctive signatures of the underlying model. We have mentioned above that the trilinear Higgs\nboson couplings are involved at the tree-level in processes with three Higgs bosons (3H) in the\nfinal state, see (2.2). But, in fact, they are also involved in inclusive processes with two Higgs\nbosons (indicated as 2HX) in the final state. For instance, the 3H-coupling has been investigated\nphenomenologically in TeV-class linear colliders in [19, 22, 23] through the double-Higgs strahlung\nprocess e+e\u2212 \u2192 HHZ or the WW double-Higgs fusion mechanism e+e\u2212 \u2192 H+H\u2212\u03bde\u03bde. These\nprocesses, which include vertices like ZZH, WWH, ZZHH, WWHH and HHH, are possible both\nin the SM and its extensions, such as the MSSM and the general 2HDM. Unfortunately, the crosssection turns out to be rather small both in the SM and in the MSSM, being of order 10\u22123 pb\nat most, i.e. equal or less than 1 fb [22]. Even worse is the situation regarding the 3H boson\nproduction in the MSSM, in which \u2013 except in the case of some particular resonant configuration \u2013\nthe typical cross-sections just border the value \u223c 0.01 fb or less [22]. In the latter reference it has\nbeen shown that, if the double and triple Higgs production cross-sections would yield sufficiently\nhigh signal rates, the system of couplings and corresponding double/triple Higgs production crosssections could in principle be solved for all trilinear Higgs self-couplings up to discrete ambiguities\nusing only these processes. But in practice these cross-sections are manifestly too small to be all\nmeasurable.\nIn stark contrast with the pessimistic situation in the MSSM, the unconstrained 2HDM may\nexhibit quite promising signatures.

In practice, the enhancement possibilities of the 2HDM couplings will be\npartially tamed by the aforementioned set of phenomenological and theoretical restrictions.\nIn the next section, we analyze the inclusive Higgs boson-pair production at linear colliders\nwithin the general 2HDM,\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 h h + X\n\n(h = h0, H0, A0, H\u00b1 ) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere X = (e+, e\u2212 ; \u03bd \u0304e , \u03bde ). At high energies (\u223cTeV) the vector boson fusion diagrams of the kind\ndisplayed in Fig. 1 constitute the dominant mechanism. Therefore, in practice the bulk mechanism\nof (2.4) is e+e\u2212 \u2192 V \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 h h + X. Notice that the fusion mechanism may trigger either one\nor no Higgs boson as a virtual intermediate state. There is also the possibility that a single real\nHiggs boson is produced on-shell and subsequently decays into two Higgs bosons of smaller mass.\nIn this respect, let us recall that, in the SM, the mechanism of single Higgs boson production via\ngauge boson fusion in e+e\u2212 collisions was already considered long ago [33] and was shown to be\ndominant with respect to the annihilation channels at high energy. Still, the cross-sections are\nvery small in the SM (of order 1 \u2212 10 fb) for masses MH \u223c 100 GeV and they were computed at\nthat time for the \"future\" LEP energies. Some enhancement can be achieved for charged Higgs\nproduction in extended Higgs models [34]. However, none of the last two sorts of processes involve\nthe Higgs boson self-couplings.\nIn the following, we concentrate on the computation of the cross-section for the processes (2.4),\nwhich do involve the 3H-couplings in some of their Feynman diagrams, see Fig. 1. It turns out that\nthese specific diagrams are responsible for the bulk of the cross-sections under the most favorable\nconditions for these processes. We will perform the calculation in the general 2HDM model and\nshall take the same set of phenomenological restrictions used in Ref. [14], to which we also refer\nthe reader for more details on the relevant pieces of the interaction Lagrangian.\n\n3\n\nDouble Higgs boson production from weak gauge boson fusion\n\nIn contrast to the simple 2H channels (2.1), the class of triple Higgs boson processes (2.2) and\nthe inclusive 2H processes (2.4) are both directly sensitive to the trilinear self-interactions, which\nimplies both a source of potential enhancement and a possible strategy to measure such couplings.\nIn Ref. [14] it was shown that, for Higgs boson masses & 100 GeV , the production cross-sections\n3\n\nThe complete list of trilinear Higgs boson couplings in the general 2HDM is presented in Table 1 of Ref.

Notice the presence of trilinear couplings of the sort h0h0h0 and H0h0h0. These Feynman\ndiagrams have been obtained with the help of the computational package FeynArts [32]. There are many other\ndiagrams contributing to the same final state, which are not of gauge fusion type and are not shown in this figure.\nOur cross-section calculation, however, includes the complete set.\n\ncorresponding to the 3H processes (2.2) could be remarkably high in the general 2HDM, lying\ntypically above the inclusive 2H cross-sections (2.1) at center-of-mass (CM) energies & 1 TeV.\nThis feature, which is impossible in the MSSM, is brought about by the enhanced Higgs boson\nself-couplings involved in the triple Higgs production mechanism (2.2).\nIn a similar way, when we move to the 2HX processes (2.4) and consider higher and higher\nenergy (typically at the \u223c TeV range of linear colliders), several opportunities for significant\nenhancement may appear. The leading mechanism behind these processes is the weak gauge-boson\nfusion mechanism\ne+e\u2212 \u2192 V \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 h h + X\n\n(V = W \u00b1 Z; h = h0, H0, A0, H\u00b1 )\n\n(3.1)\n\n(cf. Fig. 1 for the case h = h0). As a result, the three main sources of enhancement here are the\nfollowing: i) first, the t-channel gauge boson fusion is not so severely damped at high energies as\ncompared to s-channel annihilation; ii) second, the triple Higgs vertex is involved in some of the\ngauge boson fusion channels (see Fig. 1, first and second diagrams from the left in either row);\nand, finally, iii) in some cases, the virtual Higgs boson produced in the last sort of diagrams may\nnot be too far away from the resonance and, in such circumstance, the 2HX final state can be\nmore copiously produced. In particular, if the Higgs boson H 0 is heavy enough, the resonant\ndecay H 0 \u2192 h0 h0 will be kinematically allowed. Although this decay mode is also possible within\nthe MSSM, the production of the initial H 0 is mostly suppressed in this model, since its gauge\ncouplings are known to be complementary to those of the SM-like h0 . The rate for this process in\nthe MSSM is therefore not competitive with the 2HDM one. The upshot is that some of the gauge\nboson fusion processes (3.1) can become fully competitive, if not the leading mechanism of Higgs\nboson production, at high energy in the general 2HDM.\nLet us emphasize that the cross-sections for the processes (3.1) grow up to very high values of\n\u221a\nthe CM energy S. This is possible because, for the fusion diagrams, the weak gauge bosons V\ncan be quasi-real and hence have virtual momenta well-below the CM energy of the process, which\nmay satisfy S \u226b MV2 \u2013 the rest of the energy being carried away by the concomitant lepton final\nstates X = (e+, e\u2212 ; \u03bd \u0304e , \u03bde ). Therefore, while the exclusive 2H and 3H production cross-sections\n6\n\n\fare expected to decay irremissibly as \u223c 1/S owing to the Z-boson propagator that mediates the schannel diagrams, the energy behavior of the gauge fusion mechanism for 2HX production is quite\ndifferent. It is actually reminiscent of the cross-section for two-photon processes e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192\nY + e+e\u2212, which in the asymptotic limit goes roughly as \u223c (\u03b14 /M 2 ) ln2 (S/m2e ) lnn (S/M 2 ), where\nM is the threshold mass of the produced final state Y and the number n \u2265 1 depends on the high\nenergy behavior of \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 Y ) 4 . In our case, the situation is a bit more complicated because\nwe have massive gauge bosons V (rather than photons), and moreover the diagrams with triple\nHiggs vertex contain an intermediate virtual Higgs state emerging from the V V -fusion. Thus, the\ndependence of the cross-sections (2.4) with the threshold mass of the Higgs boson pair is not so\nsimple, but as in the two-photon case the cross-sections are expected to raise logarithmically with\nthe energy, rather than decaying quadratically with it. We shall confirm these expectations with\nthe numerical analysis in the next section.\nThe following comment is also in order. Even though the results on the inclusive Higgs bosonpair production (2.4) are overwhelmingly dominated by the gauge boson fusion mechanism (3.1),\nwe point out that we have computed the cross-section of the processes (2.4) with full generality,\ni.e. by including all the diagrams at order O(\u03b14ew ). This is actually necessary in order to insure\nthe gauge invariance of the overall result. Some subsets of diagrams are nonetheless completely\nirrelevant, such as e.g. those Z-mediated amplitudes where the Higgs bosons are radiated off the\nlepton legs. However, there are other more subtle subsets. In particular, there are annihilation\ndiagrams leading to the same final state (2.4) in which a pair (Z \u2217 , h\u2217 ) \u2013 consisting of a virtual\ngauge boson and a virtual Higgs boson \u2013 is produced and, subsequently, Z \u2217 decays into lepton\npairs and h\u2217 radiates a real Higgs boson. Although none of these topologies gives a dominant\neffect in front of the primary gauge boson fusion mechanisms, a careful treatment is nevertheless\nrequired in this case so as to preserve the consistency of the overall procedure. In particular, the\naforementioned Higgs strahlung process demands the introduction of a Breit-Wigner propagator\nfor the virtual bosons.\nThe above considerations suggest that large production cross-sections for the inclusive 2HX\nprocesses (2.4) should be possible at high energy regimes when both the exclusive 2H and 3H\nchannels (2.1) and (2.2) \u2013 all of them mediated by Z-boson exchange \u2013 are kinematically suppressed\nas \u223c 1/S. We have undertaken this calculation using the computational tool CompHEP [36]. In\nsome steps of the computation, we have also made use of FeynArts and FormCalc [32], which\nserved also for cross-checking purposes. Furthermore, to ease the comparison with the existing\nanalysis of the 3H processes (2.2), we present our numerical calculation on the basis of the same\nset of free parameters as in [14], i.e.\n(Mh0 , MH0 , MA0 , MH\u00b1 , tan \u03b1, tan \u03b2) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThis means that the general 2HDM Higgs potential is treated under the assumption that \u03bb5 = \u03bb6\n(in order not to depart too much from the the MSSM structure of the Higgs sector, see [14]\nfor details). For a realistic computation, one has to include all known existing constraints. For\nexample, there are strong limitations on the parameters of a type-II 2HDM coming from FCNC\nprocesses, mainly from the charged Higgs boson contributions to B(b \u2192 s\u03b3), which would overshoot\nthe allowed experimental range unless MH\u00b1 & 350 GeV [30]; and there are also the radiative\nThe corresponding analysis of the single Higgs production through photon-photon fusion, e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 h+X\nwithin the general 2HDM will be discussed in a forthcoming publication [35].\n4\n\n7\n\n\fcorrections to \u03b4\u03c1 from the 2HDM sector, which must not exceed the limit |\u03b4\u03c12HDM | \u2264 10\u22123 .\nFinally, there are of course the direct search limits from LEP and the Tevatron [31]. All these\nconstraints are integrated in our codes and, thus, the entire numerical analysis is consistent with\nthese bounds, along with the general unitarity constraints which apply to both type-I and type-II\n2HDM. More details on these constraints are discussed in [14], to which we refer the reader for\nadditional information. Let us also note that, in order to obtain more accurate results, a running\nvalue for the electromagnetic coupling constant \u03b1(MZ ) = 1/127.9 has been used.\n\n3.1\n\nNon-resonant double Higgs boson production\n\nFor the numerical analysis, we will consider five different sets (I-V) of parameters of the general\n2HDM Higgs sector, see Table 1. This should suffice to illustrate the enhancement possibilities of\nthe inclusive 2HX cross-section (3.1). Notice that sets I-II and V are compatible with the type-II\n2HDM (because the charged Higgs boson mass is sufficiently heavy to satisfy the aforementioned\nconstraints). These sets are actually possible for type-I models too. On the other hand, the\nrelatively light Higgs boson mass sets III-IV will be used (exclusively) for the less constrained type\nI models. Let us also remark that in the case of sets I-III the resonant decay H0 \u2192 h0 h0 is not\npossible, although for Sets I and III the mass threshold for such resonant mode is closer than for\nSet II. Finally, Sets IV and V explore the possibility of having some resonant Higgs boson decays\nand are mainly intended for type-I and type-II models, respectively. (Set V is also compatible with\ntype-I models, as remarked before, but we mainly aim at type-II ones for that set). We note that\nin the case of Set IV, actually all of the resonant decays H0 \u2192 h0h0, A0A0, H+ H\u2212 are kinematically\nallowed whereas for Set V only the first decay is available.\n2HDM\n\nSet I\n\nSet II\n\nSet III\n\nSet IV\n\nSet V\n\nMh0 [GeV]\nMH 0 [GeV]\nMA0 [GeV]\nMH \u00b1 [GeV]\n\n100\n190\n360\n350\n\n150\n250\n360\n350\n\n150\n290\n150\n150\n\n100\n225\n110\n105\n\n125\n280\n300\n350\n\nTable 1: Higgs boson mass parameters used to discuss phenomenologically relevant scenarios for the enhanced 2HX\nproduction cross-sections (see the text). Sets III and IV are possible only for type I models.\n\nWe consider first the numerical results obtained from the non-resonant scenarios, which are\nmore general. In doing so, we wish to compare the cross-sections for both the 3H and 2HX channels\n(2.2) and (2.4), respectively. In Fig. 2a, we show these production cross-sections as a function of\nthe CM energy for Set I of Higgs boson masses (full lines in that figure). The fixed value of the CPeven mixing angle in this figure (sin \u03b1 = \u22120.7) has been determined in combination with tan \u03b2 after\nmaximizing the cross-sections for the mass Set I under the various constraints discussed previously.\nThe relevant trilinear Higgs self-couplings h0h0h0 and H0h0h0, and hence the overall production\ncross-section, become maximally enhanced at tan \u03b2 \u2243 25. The main constraint that fixes the\naforementioned tan \u03b2 value is the unitarity bound of the trilinear Higgs couplings. In order to\nexplore the effect on the cross-sections after significantly increasing some masses (while respecting\nall the necessary bounds mentioned above), we also show the corresponding 2HX and 3H crosssections for MA0 = MH \u00b1 = 800 GeV, with all other parameters fixed as in Set I (dashed curves\nin that figure).

We fix sin \u03b1 = \u22120.7 and tan \u03b2 = 25, in which case the relevant 3H couplings, and hence\nthe production cross-section, are maximally enhanced. The 2HX and 3H cross-sections are also depicted (in dashed\nlines) as in the previous case but for MA0 = MH \u00b1 = 800 GeV; here, however, tan \u03b2 \u2243 4 in order to preserve the\nconsistency with the unitarity bounds.

Noteworthy in Fig. 2 is that the kinematical threshold for the overall 3H contribution shifts\nto higher energies when we boost MA0 up to 800 GeV. Let us clarify that the rise of further\n\u221a\nthresholds does not leave a visible footprint on \u03c3( S), provided one of the 3H channels (in the\npresent case h0h0A0) dominates over the remaining ones. The subdominant channels, although\nhave less enhanced 3H couplings and a larger phase-space suppression, contribute to smooth out\n\u221a\nsignificantly the damping of the total 3H cross-section as a function of S as compared to the\nindividual channels.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the numerical analysis of the 2HX cross-section for various values of tan \u03b2,\nwith the Higgs mass parameters taken as in Set I (Fig. 3a) and Set II (Fig. 3b). The corresponding\n3H production cross-sections are shown for comparison in the lower panels (Figs. 3c and 3d).\nLikewise, in Fig. 2b we display the corresponding results obtained for a lower enhancement of the\n3H couplings (viz. up to one half of the standard unitarity bound used in [14]). Notice that our\nenergy scan actually sweeps a wide range which reaches up to 5 TeV in order to better show the\nasymptotic trend of the cross-sections. In practice, the ILC will cover only the approximate range\n0.5 \u2212 1.5 TeV, whereas CLIC may reach 3 TeV [16].\nThe dominant effect on the inclusive 2HX amplitudes is proportional to the Higgs trilinear\ncouplings H0h0h0 and h0h0h0. These couplings are enhanced at large values of tan \u03b2, as can be\nseen from the first Eq. (2.3) and in general from Table 1 of Ref. [14]. Let us also emphasize that, in\norder to better appreciate the tan \u03b2-dependence, the maximum 2HX and 3H cases corresponding\nto tan \u03b2 = 25 are again included in Figs. 3a,c along with the other (smaller) tan \u03b2 values. Although\nthe overall production rates decrease with decreasing tan \u03b2, the 2HX channel remains dominant at\n\u221a\n(and above) S = 1 TeV for Set I. In this same energy range, but for Higgs boson masses as in Set\nII, the 2HX channel remains comparable to the 3H channel only for the largest allowed values of\ntan \u03b2.

As\nin the previous figure, we take sin \u03b1 = \u22120.7 and we study the behavior of the cross-section over different values of\ntan \u03b2. In the right axis of each plot, we track the predicted number of events per 100fb-1 of integrated luminosity.\n\nleading ones even at small values of tan \u03b2. To be sure, some of these gauge fusion processes furnish\na very competitive strategy to probe the 3H self-couplings. This strategy nicely complements the\nprospects that were singled out for the exclusive 3H channels in Ref. [14], particularly at very large\ncenter-of-mass energies, where the 3H signal is greatly suppressed whilst the 2HX one remains\nsustained and even logarithmically enhanced. Cross-sections for the remaining 2HX final states\ncontaining heavier Higgs bosons are not shown in Fig. 3 as they are found to have negligible\nproduction rates when compared to the corresponding 3H final states in this scenario. Explicitly,\nthe maximum production rates are found to be of the order 10\u22122 pb for the h0H0 case, and below\n10\u22123 pb for the rest of the 2HX final states.\nNotwithstanding, a starkly distinct panorama shows up for lighter H\u00b1 and A0 bosons. In\n\u221a\nFigure 4a, we display \u03c3( S) corresponding to Set III of Higgs boson masses (see Table 1), in\nwhich case sizable cross-sections are attained for a number of 2HX channels: H+ H\u2212 yields \u223c 1 pb;\nh0h0 and A0A0 give \u223c 0.1 pb, and h0H0 renders \u223c 0.01 pb.

Displayed are the Higgs\nboson-pair channels whose cross-sections lie above 0.01 pb, together with the corresponding triple-Higgs production\nrate, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 3H, for each scenario. The values chosen for sin \u03b1 and tan \u03b2 are quoted in the figures.\n\nFig. 4b we present the corresponding results for Set IV of Higgs boson masses, which also applies\nexclusively for type-I models, but refers to the resonant situation in which the on-shell decays\nH0 \u2192 h0h0, A0A0, H+ H\u2212 are all allowed. In the next section, we further dwell on the resonant\ncase, but we consider a scenario (valid for both type-I and type-II models) where only the final\nstate with two light CP-even Higgs bosons is permitted, i.e. H0 \u2192 h0h0, and we study it in more\ndetail.\n\n3.2\n\nResonant double Higgs boson production\n\nWe note that the scenarios considered above are proper of the general 2HDM. In the MSSM\ncase, where the masses of the CP-even light and heavy Higgs bosons h0, H0 are not independent\nparameters once tan \u03b2 and MA0 are given [3], the mass splittings indicated in Table 1 are not\npossible. For larger enough values of MH0 , there is a drastic change in the behaviour for the\nproduction cross-section of the inclusive channel e+e\u2212 \u2192 h0h0 + X since the on-shell decay H0 \u2192\nh0h0 becomes kinematically available. Indeed, with MH0 > 2Mh0 the cross-sections are somewhat\nless dependent upon the enhancement of the Higgs trilinear couplings, the reason being that highly\nenhanced trilinears now lead to a dramatic broadening of the H0 resonance with a branching ratio\nessentially of order one.\nIn Figures 5a-5d, we exhibit a panoply of 2HX and 3H production cross-sections for the Higgs\nboson masses as in Set V of Table 1. We explore the dependence with the CM energy and the\nmixing angles of the Higgs sector. In all cases, it corresponds to a situation where the on-shell\ndecay H0 \u2192 h0h0 is possible but, in contradistinction to Set IV considered in Fig. 4b, the alternate\ndecays H0 \u2192 A0A0, H+ H\u2212 are not allowed. The case under consideration is more along the line\nof type-II models, which are the the closest ones to the SUSY case. From these figures, it is\npatent that the inclusive cross-section exceeds the 3H channel for all energies above the TeV scale.\nFurthermore, there is a significant dependence of the 2HX cross-section on sin \u03b1, which enters\nthrough the vertex factor cos2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) associated to the on-shell production of H 0 from W + W \u2212\nand Z 0 Z 0 fusion (cf. Fig. 1). At the same time, the 2HX production cross-sections are now largely\nindependent of tan \u03b2, because changing this parameter just leads to small fluctuations of the H 0\n11\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\n1\n\nevents per 100 fb\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n0.01\nsin \u03b1 = 0.99\nsin \u03b1 = 0.3\nsin \u03b1 = 0.2\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\nEcm [GeV]\n\n4000\n\n1000\n\n5000\n\n2000\n\n3000\nEcm [GeV]\n\n4000\n\nd)\n\nc)\n0.01\n\n1000\n\nsin \u03b1 = 0.99\nsin \u03b1 = 0.3\nsin \u03b1 = 0.2\n\n-1\n\nSet V\nsin \u03b1 = 0.3\ntan \u03b2 = 5\ntan \u03b2 = 10\ntan \u03b2 = 15\n\nSet V\ntan\u03b2 = 10\n\n100\n\n0.001\n\n+ -\n\n\u03c3 (e e -> 3H) [pb]\n\n5000\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\nEcm [GeV]\n\n4000\n\n1000\n\n5000\n\nFigure 5: Cross-section (in pb) as a function of\n\n2000\n\n3000\nEcm [GeV]\n\n4000\n\nevents per 100 fb\n\n+ -\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c3 (e e -> h h + X) [pb]\n\n0.1\n\n-1\n\n1e+05\nSet V\nsin\u03b1 = 0.3\ntan \u03b2 = 5\ntan \u03b2 = 10\ntan \u03b2 = 15\n\nSet V\ntan\u03b2 = 10\n\n5000\n\n\u221a\n\nS (in GeV) for e+e\u2212 \u2192 h0h0 + X in the resonant case (upper\npanels) and for the sum of all the 3H channels e e \u2192 3H (lower panels).

At variance with this mild tan \u03b2 dependence of the 2HX processes,\nthe main enhancement source of the 3H final states still resides in the tan \u03b2 effective dependence\nof the Higgs trilinears, as can be seen in Figure 5d.\nInterestingly enough, let us emphasize that the potentially large values of the 2HX cross-sections\nstudied up to now, either with resonant or non-resonant configurations, are a kind of trademark\nprediction of the non-supersymmetric two-Higgs-doublet models. Of course, the collection of\ndiagrams shown in Fig. 1 also accounts for the corresponding 2HX processes within the MSSM.\nNonetheless, the 3H couplings are constrained by supersymmetry and are directly related to the\nelectroweak gauge couplings; there is therefore no possibility of enhancement. Furthermore, in the\nMSSM the region of parameter space where the relation MH0 > 2 Mh0 holds is dominant. As a\nconsequence, the inclusive 2HX production will be brought about predominantly by the production\nof on-shell H0 bosons via W+ W\u2212 fusion (cf. Fig. 1) and followed by their subsequent on-shell decay\nH0 \u2192 h0h0. As already mentioned, it is precisely the W+ W\u2212 H0 \u223c cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) coupling that limits\nthe resonant 2HX production in the MSSM because supersymmetry constrains the lightest CP-even\nHiggs boson h0 to have SM-like couplings when the remaining partners are heavy. Consequently,\nthe resulting cross-sections are expected to lie far below the optimal 2HDM yields.

In all of them we\nfind that the optimal cross-section value corresponds to tan \u03b2 & 2.\n\nthese features in a concrete way, in Table 2 we compute the predicted MSSM cross-sections for the\ninclusive production of a h0h0 pair, \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 h0h0 + X). Concerning the CM energies, we assume\n\u221a\nthe operation range that is scheduled for either the ILC ( S = 0.5 \u2212 1.5 TeV) and CLIC (up to\n\u221a\nS = 3 TeV), and take three different CP-odd Higgs boson masses MA0 = 200 , 300 and 500 GeV.\nThe value of tan \u03b2 is not shown, but it is determined such that to (approximately) optimize the\ncorresponding production rate. In calculating these values, we have taken all soft SUSY-breaking\nmasses equal to MSUSY = 1 TeV, along with \u03bc = 200 GeV and At = Ab = A\u03c4 = 1 TeV 5 .\nFrom Table 2, we see that the 2HX rates render a contribution of order of a few fb , at most, for\nMA0 > 300 GeV. Nevertheless, there is a narrow corner in the region of low MA0 /low tan \u03b2 (which\nis severely restricted by the LEP mass bounds [31]) wherein the W+ W\u2212 H0 coupling is not so much\nhampered and hence the cross-section climbs up to \u223c 10 fb. By comparing the (optimal) values in\nTable 2 to the most favorable scenarios displayed in Figures 2-5, we conclude that the 2HX signal\nin the 2HDM is typically a factor 10 \u2212 100 larger than its MSSM counterpart.\nFinally, we have also evaluated the \"SM background\", i.e. the cross-section for double Higgs\nproduction from gauge fusion in the SM for the same \u223cTeV energies under study. We find e.g.\nthat \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 V \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 H H + X) = 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22125 pb for SM Higgs boson masses in the range\nMH = 115 \u2212 300 GeV (see Table 3), which is relatively quite small as compared to our favorite\n2HDM scenarios. Furthermore, we note that the produced SM Higgs boson will predominantly\ndecay into gauge boson pairs W + W \u2212 , Z 0 Z 0 and (to a lesser extent) to bottom quark pairs bb\u0304\nand top quark pairs tt\u0304 (if kinematically possible). Subsequently, the gauge bosons will decay both\ninto leptonic and light quark channels. In contrast, in the 2HDM case, the very same conditions\nthat favor the fusion production of Higgs bosons do also favor the decay of the produced Higgs\nboson into other Higgs bosons and these into heavy quarks. So the kind of signature is very\ndistinct. Another source of background to the 2HDM signal could come from gauge boson fusion\ninto gauge bosons, essentially Z0 pairs. If these gauge bosons subsequently decay into quarks, this\nwould mimic the Higgs boson themselves decaying into quark pairs. However, explicit calculation\nshows that the cross-section \u03c3(e+e\u2212 \u2192 V \u2217 V \u2217 \u2192 Z0 Z0 X) reaches up to 0.1pb at most (Cf. Table\n3). Hence it lies one order of magnitude below the favorite 2HX cases. For the less favorable\nsituations, however, further studies on the final jet distribution might be necessary to disentangle\nthe corresponding signatures.\n5\n\nFor the determination of the MSSM Higgs sector and the mixing angle \u03b1 we make use of the FeynHiggsFast\ncode, which is included by default in the CompHEP setup [37].\n\n13\n\n\fBackground\n\u221a\n\u03c3( S = 1.5 TeV)[pb]\n\u221a\n\u03c3( S = 3 TeV)[pb]\n\nMHSM = 115 GeV\nHSM HSM Z0 Z0\n\nMHSM = 300 GeV\nHSM HSM Z0 Z0\n\n3.1 \u00d7 10\u22124\n1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123\n\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n0.02\n0.06\n\n0.06\n0.11\n\nTable 3: Cross-sections for the leading background processes within the Standard Model, these are the SM Higgs\nboson pair-production, e+e\u2212 \u2192 HSM HSM + X, and the Z0 boson pair production, e+e\u2212 \u2192 Z 0 Z 0 + X. The\ncorresponding production rates are computed for MHSM = (115, 300) GeV in order to account for phenomenologically\nrelevant scenarios.

We have found that the cross-sections for some of these processes can be several\norders of magnitude larger than their MSSM counterparts. Moreover, in contrast to the two-body\nfinal states (2.1), a tree-level analysis of the gauge fusion mechanism could reveal the general\n2HDM nature of the Higgs bosons involved, if the enhancement properties that we have explored\neffectively apply in the physical region of the parameter space. This was shown to be the case\nalso for the previously considered processes (2.2) with three Higgs bosons in the final state [14].\nHowever, the inclusive 2HX channels (3.1) could be by far the leading mechanism for Higgs boson\nproduction at the characteristic TeV energies of the planned ILC and CLIC colliders [16]. We\nfind remarkable opportunities whose threefold origin stems from: i) the sustained (logarithmic)\n\u221a\ngrowing of the weak gauge boson fusion channels with S at TeV energies; ii) the enhanced regime\nof the trilinear (3H) Higgs boson couplings in the 2HDM; and iii) the possible resonant (or near\nresonant) decay of an intermediate Higgs boson into the final Higgs boson-pairs.\nPhenomenologically interesting results are attained in large regions of the 2HDM parameter\nspace. In these domains, the maximum cross-section of the inclusive production of Higgs boson\npairs (2.4) can be far above (one to two orders of magnitude) the exclusive triple-Higgs boson\nevents (2.2). The possible sources of background (coming from SM Higgs- and gauge-boson pair\nproduction) are mostly negligible. In the case of type-II models, which are closer to the MSSM\nHiggs sector, two simultaneously of the inclusive processes (2.4) can have cross-sections above 0.01\npb (and one of them at the level of 1 pb), therefore with production rates at the level of 103 \u2212 105\nevents per 100 fb-1 of integrated luminosity. Let us note that type-I models may also lead to crosssections of order of 1 pb in particular channels, but here we may have up to four channels (2.4)\nsimultaneously having sizeable cross-sections of 0.01 \u2212 0.1 pb, thus amounting to production rates\nof 103 \u2212 104 events for the same segment of integrated luminosity. In contrast, the corresponding\nMSSM maximum cross-sections are typically of the order of (0.1\u22121) fb, and hence some 100\u22121000\ntimes smaller (similar to the fusion production of Higgs boson pairs in the SM).\nLet us also mention that for type-II models (characterized by a heavier spectrum of Higgs\nboson masses), the leading decay modes for each of the Higgs bosons in a typical final state will\nbe into heavy quarks. For example, if we take the channel (2.4) corresponding to the Higgs boson\npair h0 h0, each of the neutral Higgs bosons will mainly decay as h0 \u2192 bb. In this region of\nparameter space, the alternate Higgs boson decays into gauge bosons (such as h0 \u2192 W+W\u2212, ZZ)\nare either kinematically forbidden or simply not dominant. In practice we would therefore expect\n14\n\n\fto see a sizable number of 4-prong final states consisting of highly energetic (Mh0 /2 > 50 GeV )\nb b-jets (or t b-jets from charged Higgs decays from the H+ H\u2212 final state), which should be clearly\ndistinguishable in a linear e+e\u2212-collider.\nWe have also demonstrated that by exploring e+e\u2212 collisions at even higher energies (say, up\nto the characteristic 3 TeV range expected for CLIC) the opportunities could still be better. The\nmost favored channel may then reach a cross-section at the level of 5 pb, and thus producing\naround half million events in the same range of integrated luminosity. In general, this upgrading\nshould enable to perform accurate measurements of the cross-sections of several channels (2.4) and\ndisentangle enough correlations among the parameters of the model so as to be able to pin down\nthe corresponding Higgs boson masses and couplings at high precision. Needless to say, a truly\naccurate analysis demands the incorporation of quantum effects in the trilinear interactions. Such\nstudy, however, goes far beyond the scope of the present letter, whose main aim is only to show that\nclear signs of new physics can be highlighted already from an analysis of Higgs boson production\nthrough gauge boson fusion at leading order. Further investigation on these 2HX channels may\nalso be of interest in the context of the LHC. However, appropriate studies of the distribution of\nthe signal versus the background should be undertaken in order to ascertain whether the dominant\nsignatures of the 2HX events (in the form of heavy-quark jets) could be disentangled from the\nimportant QCD background inherent in the physics of that collider.\nIn summary, experiments at linear colliders such as the ILC and CLIC can provide the cleanest\nsignals of new physics and can be of paramount importance as a high precision tool to underpine\nthe most sensitive building blocks of the gauge theories, and most significantly the structure of the\nHiggs potential.\nAcknowledgments We thank J.
