To this spectrum are\nassociated \"eigen-directions\", called Lyapunov modes. We carefully analyze these modes\nand show how they are naturally associated with vector fields over the container. We also\nshow that the Lyapunov exponents, and the coupled dynamics of the modes (where it exists)\nfollow linear laws, whose coefficients only depend on the density of the gas, but not on aspect\nratio and very little on the boundary conditions.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn this paper, we study the Lyapunov spectra of two-dimensional hard-disk systems and, in particular, the associated \"Lyapunov modes\" [1, 2]. Recently, this topic has received considerable\nattention [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and a lot of progress has been made in the understanding of the issues\ninvolved. In the present work we synthesize and expand the results found earlier. In particular,\nwe completely classify these modes and give a simple interpretation of their dynamics, in particular for systems with arbitrary aspect ratio. We furthermore present new simulations in support\nof this classification.\nThe Lyapunov exponents describe the rates of exponential growth, or decay, of infinitesimal\nphase-space perturbations, and are taken to be ordered according to \u03bb(1) > \u03bb(2) > * * * > \u03bb(l) .1\n1\n\nl is at most the dimension of the phase space. Note that \u03bb(j) stands for different Lyapunov exponents, while we\nwill use \u03bbi when we consider them with multiplicity.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nI NTRODUCTION\n\nBecause of the Hamiltonian nature of the problem, they come in conjugate pairs,\n\u03bb(j) = \u2212\u03bb(l\u2212j+1) .\nAs is well-known, 0 is always a Lyapunov exponent for such systems and therefore, as a consequence, l is odd. At any point \u03be in phase space, the tangent space T X(\u03be) decomposes into a\nsum\nT X(\u03be) = E (1) (\u03be) \u2295 * * * \u2295 E (l) (\u03be) ,\nwhere E (j)(\u03be) is the (linear) space of those perturbations of the initial condition \u03be whose growth\nrate is \u03bb(j) for the forward dynamics, and \u2212\u03bb(j) for the time reversed dynamics. This decomposition is called the Oseledec splitting.\nWe say that the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(j) is d-fold degenerate if dim E (j)(\u03be) = d. It should be\nnoted that, when the Lyapunov exponents are d-fold degenerate, only the subspace corresponding\nto all d of them is well defined2 . The main idea of our full classification of Lyapunov exponents\nand their modes is based on this simple observation.\nThe Lyapunov modes are defined as follows: at time t = 0, we take n orthogonal tangent\nvectors at \u03be and, by applying to them the tangent-space dynamics3 for a long-enough time t,\nmap them onto n vectors which, generally, are not orthogonal but still span an n-dimensional\nsubspace Sn (t). If, instead of n, we consider only n \u2212 1 vectors, they similarly span an n \u2212 1\ndimensional subspace Sn\u22121 (t), such that Sn\u22121 (t) \u2282 Sn (t). The Lyapunov mode is a unit vector\nin Sn (t) which is orthogonal to the space Sn\u22121 (t). We will give a precise definition in the next\nsection, explain the algorithmic aspects in Sect. 3.1 and relate the modes to Oseledec's subspaces\nin Sect. 3.2\nThe study of Lyapunov modes [2, 8] has revealed interesting spatial structures which we\nwill define later but which come in two types: localized structures associated with the large\npositive and negative Lyapunov exponents, and smooth delocalized structures of wave-like type\nfor exponents close to zero [1, 8]. The exponents associated with the latter are degenerate and\ngive rise to a step-like appearance of the Lyapunov spectrum as is shown, for example, in Fig. 1.\nThe discovery of these structures has led to several studies [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] which go some way\nin explaining their origin and their dynamics. In this paper, we show how they are related to the\nsymmetries of the container in which the particles move (including the boundary conditions).\nAt the same time we obtain a classification of the degeneracies of the Lyapunov exponents near\nzero. This classification allows to view the so-called \"mode dynamics\" from a new geometrical\nperspective.\n2\n3\n\nIn this, and many other aspects, the theory of Lyapunov exponents is very similar to that of matrices.\nSee Section 2 for details.\n\n\fN OTATION\n\n3\n\nAND SUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\n7\n2\n\u03bb\n\n6\n1\n\n5\n0\n1520\n\n1540\nl\n\n1560\n\n\u03bb\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nl/2N\n\nFigure 1: Lyapunov spectrum for N = 780 hard disks at a density \u03c1 \u2261 N/(Lx Ly ) = 0.8 in a\nrectangular periodic box with an aspect ratio Ly /Lx = 0.867. The insert provides a magnified\nview of the mode regime. l is the Lyapunov index numbering the exponents.\n\nThe paper starts with a summary of results, passes through a precise definition of the Lyapunov modes, and then describes them as vector fields. In Sect. 4 these vector fields are classified,\nand their dynamics is studied in Sect. 5. The last sections deal with the density dependence and\nwith possible hydrodynamic aspects.\n\n2 Notation and summary of results\nWe consider a system of N hard disks of diameter \u03c3 and mass m moving in a two-dimensional\nrectangular container with sides of lengths Lx and Ly . At this point, we do not need to specify\nthe boundary conditions.4 The phase space of such a system is\nX = R2N \u00d7 ([0, Lx ] \u00d7 [0, Ly ])N ,\nand a phase point \u03be in X is\n\u03be = (p, q) = (p1 , . . . , pN , q1 , . . . , qN ) .\nWhen necessary, we will write qi = (qi,x , qi,y ) to distinguish the two position components of\nparticle i, and similarly for the momenta. The dynamics of the system is that of free flight, interrupted by elastic binary collisions. If \u03be0 is the state of the system at time 0, then \u03bet = \u03a6t (\u03be0 ) is\nthe state at time t, where \u03a6t : X \u2192 X defines the flow.\n4\n\nWe will consider reflecting and periodic boundary conditions.\n\n\f4\n\nN OTATION\n\nAND SUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\nApart from issues of differentiability, which will be addressed when we describe the numerical implementation in Section 3, we call D\u03a6t the tangent flow. Informally speaking, it is a\n4N \u00d7 4N matrix of partial derivatives and can be thought of as the first-order term (in \u03b5) in an\nexpansion of the perturbed flow,\n\u03a6t (\u03be0 + \u03b5\u03b4\u03be) = \u03a6t (\u03be0 ) + \u03b5 D\u03a6t |\u03be * \u03b4\u03be + O(\u03b52 ) .\n0\n\nThe vector \u03b4\u03be lies in the tangent space T X (at \u03be0 ) to the manifold X; in our case T X(\u03be0 ) = R4N .\nWe next invoke the multiplicative ergodic theorem of Oseledec [9, 10]. To do so, we need\nergodicity of the Liouville measure. Without further knowledge, we assume this for our case.\nTheorem: There exist an integer l and numbers \u03bb(j) , j = 1, . . . , l such that for almost every\n\u03be \u2208 X (with respect to the Liouville measure) the tangent space splits into\nT X(\u03be) = E (1) (\u03be) \u2295 E (2) (\u03be) \u2295 * * * \u2295 E (l) (\u03be) ,\nwith the property:\n\n1\nlog k D\u03a6t |\u03be \u03b4\u03bek = \u00b1\u03bb(j)\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e |t|\nlim\n\nfor \u03b4\u03be \u2208 E (j) (\u03be). The spaces E (j)(\u03be) are covariant: D\u03a6t |\u03be E (j)(\u03be) = E (j) (\u03a6t (\u03be)).\nThe dimension d(j) of E (j) (\u03be) is called multiplicity of the exponent \u03bb(j). In general the E (j) are\nnot orthogonal to each other.\nWe also use the notation\n\u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03bbi \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03bb4N\nto denote the Lyapunov exponents repeated with multiplicities, where the index is referred to as\nthe Lyapunov index. This notation is more adequate for describing numerical methods of measurement, in which tangent-space dynamics is probed by a set of vectors. With these notations\nthe relation between the \u03bb(j) and the \u03bbi is given by\n\u03bb(j) = \u03bbf (j\u22121) +1 = . . . = \u03bbf (j) ,\nwhere f (j) = d(1) + * * * + d(j). Choosing j \u2208 {1, . . . , l} and letting F (j) = E (1) \u2295 * * * \u2295 E (j) , we\ndefine the d(j) Lyapunov modes associated with \u03bb(j) as any orthogonal spanning set of the space\nM (j) \u2261 (F (j\u22121) )\u22a5 \u2229 F (j) .\n\n(1)\n\nA finer decomposition of this spanning set will be obtained when we describe the algorithm used,\nsee Sect. 3.1. The subspaces M (j) are very similar to the subspaces E (j) : they have the same dimension and also satisfy F (j) = M (1) \u2295 * * * \u2295 M (j) . However, they are not identical, because of\n\n\fN OTATION\n\n5\n\nAND SUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\nthe orthogonality constraint in (1). This will be explained in Sect. 3.2.\nIn this summary, we focus on rectangular boxes with periodic boundary conditions. Narrow\nsystems (Ly < 2\u03c3) or systems with reflecting boundaries have a very similar Lyapunov spectrum, but some exponents found in the periodic case are either absent, or appear with smaller\nmultiplicities. We shall treat such systems in Sect. 4.3 but concentrate, until then, on the \"general\" periodic case. However, it should be noted that systems with reflecting boundaries give\nimportant information on the relation between the vanishing and the small Lyapunov exponents\n(see Ex. 6 below).\nThe Lyapunov exponents near zero are found to be proportional to the wave numbers of the\nsystem,\nr\nk(nx ,ny ) =\n\n( L2\u03c0 nx )2 + ( L2\u03c0 ny )2 ,\nx\n\ny\n\nnx , ny = 0, 1, . . . .\n\n(2)\n\nRemark: This result, as well as all results mentioned below, are to be understood in the limit of\nan infinite number of disks, at fixed density. In particular, we omit higher order terms (in k) in\nmost of our statements.\nThe Lyapunov exponents have the following properties:\nLyapunov Spectrum: For gases of hard disks, the Lyapunov exponents near zero are fully determined by two (positive) constants, cL and cT . For small-enough n = (nx , ny ), these exponents\nlie on two straight lines.5\n1) Transverse branch (T) : \u03bb = \u00b1cT kn , with multiplicity 4 (2 if either nx or ny is zero)\n2) Longitudinal branch (L) : \u03bb = \u00b1cL kn , with multiplicity 8 (4 if either nx or ny is zero)\nThe multiplicities of both branches will be explained by simple geometric observations in Sect. 4.2.\nWhile the linear laws resemble the square roots of the eigenvalues of a Laplacian in the box, we\nhave no explanation beyond those already given in Ref. [3]. (The square root is related to the\nsymplectic nature of the problem.) Additional degeneracies arise in square systems and may\naccidentally appear also for specific aspect ratios Ly /Lx .\nWe next explain how to visualize a mode [11, 8]. Fix \u03be = (p, q) \u2208 X, and let \u03b4\u03be be a Lyapunov\nmode of T X(\u03be). The vector \u03b4\u03be = (\u03b4p, \u03b4q) has 4N components, 2N associated with the momenta\nand 2N with the positions. Consider, for example, the q components, \u03b4q1 , . . . , \u03b4qN , where each\n5\n\nFor both the longitudinal and transverse modes the linear k dependence of \u03bb is only the first term of an expansion\nin powers of k [8], \u03bb = ck + c2 k 2 . . .. For positive \u03bb, c2 is positive, but small. For a second order calculation in k,\nsee [7].\n\n\f6\n\nN OTATION\n\u03b4x(\u03bb1549)\n0\n\nAND SUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\n\u03b4x(\u03bb1535)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\ny\n\ny\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b4y(\u03bb1535)\n\n20\n\u03b4y(\u03bb1549)\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\nx\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nx\n\nFigure 2: Modes for the 780-disk system with periodic boundaries characterized in Fig. 1.

By\ndrawing the perturbation vectors \u03b4qj at the positions qj of the particles in the box, one obtains a\nfield of vectors as is shown in Fig. 2. For dense-enough fluids we obtain a vector field in every\npoint of the box by interpolating between the particles.\nIt has been observed that for those Lyapunov exponents close to zero, this vector field is well\napproximated by trigonometric functions of the spatial coordinates x and y [1, 8]. In particular,\nthe number of nodes (nx , ny ) of the vector field determines a wave number kn . We then say that\n\u03b4\u03be is a mode of wave number kn . Our second main result is:\nMode Classification: The subspaces M (j) (\u03be) (defined in (1)) belonging to Lyapunov exponents\n\u03bb(j) close to zero fall into two categories:\n1) Transverse branch: modes associated with a Lyapunov exponent \u00b1cT kn are divergence-free\nperiodic fields of wave number kn .\n2) Longitudinal branch: The modes associated with the Lyapunov exponent \u00b1cL kn are of two\ntypes:\n(i) Half of them are irrotational periodic vector fields of wave number kn (called L-modes);\n(ii) The others are scalar modulations with wave number kn of the momentum field, (called\nP or momentum modes).\nThe L and the P-modes turn out to be paired: the P-mode has components pi A(qi ) and the corresponding L-mode has components \u2207A(qi ), where A is a scalar function, see (9). In the following,\nwe refer to an L-mode and its corresponding P-mode as an LP pair. We will give more details\n\n\fTANGENT- SPACE\n\n7\n\nDYNAMICS\n\non this relation below. Results in this direction have been obtained in Refs. [4, 6, 7].\nAn interesting question, which is related to some hydrodynamic aspects of the fluid, is an\napparent propagation of the L and P-modes in physical space. It is a consequence of the motion\nof the tangent vectors in the subspaces M (j) (\u03bet ), to which we refer as mode dynamics. It will be\ndescribed in detail in Section 5. We note that this motion is not only determined by the tangent\nflow, but also by the re-orthonormalization process part of the algorithm for the simulation. Mode\ndynamics was observed early on [2, 11], but attempts to compute the propagation velocities are\nstill scarce and, at present, only work for low densities [5, 7]. Here, we give a more precise\ndefinition and provide numerical results.\nMode Dynamics: In an M (j) space of Longitudinal and P-modes, the mode dynamics couples\nLP pairs. When restricted to the two-dimensional subspace spanned by a given LP pair, it reduces\nto a rotation at constant angular velocity \u03c9n which is proportional to the wave number kn ,\n\u03c9n = v kn ,\nwhere v has the dimension of a velocity.\nIn the remainder of the paper we state these results more precisely and give details about\nhow they are obtained. They are of two types: First, a theoretical description of the modes,\nwhich is based on the symmetries of the system. Second, a detailed account of the numerical\nalgorithms necessary to substantiate our claims (the difficulty being the decomposition of the d(j)\ndimensional spaces M (j) (\u03be)).\n\n3 Tangent-space dynamics\nThe dynamics of hard disks consists of phases of free flight interrupted by instantaneous elastic\ncollisions. We denote the map for free flights of duration \u03c4 by F \u03c4 , and the collision map by C.\nThen, the evolution of an initial state, \u03be0 , is given by\n\u03bet = F \u03c4n \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 C \u25e6 F \u03c42 \u25e6 C \u25e6 F \u03c41 \u03be0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4n are the time intervals between successive collisions. The tangent-space dynamics of an infinitesimal perturbation \u03b4\u03be0 of \u03be0 is given by the tangent map of the flow (3) :\n\u03b4\u03bet = DF \u03c4n |\u03ben+ * * * DC |\u03be\u2212 * DF \u03c42 |\u03be+ * DC |\u03be\u2212 * DF \u03c41 |\u03be \u03b4\u03be0 ,\n2\n\n\u03bek\u2212\n\n1\n\nth\n\n1\n\n\u03bek+\n\n0\n\nC(\u03bek\u2212 )\n\nwhere\ndenotes the state just before the k collision, and\n=\nis the state immediately\n6\n\u03c4\nafter. Here, DF |\u03be and DC |\u03be are 4N \u00d74N symplectic matrices. For the sake of simplicity, the\nk\nk\nflow is also called \u03a6t : namely \u03a6t (\u03be0 ) = \u03bet , and we often write \u03b4\u03bet = D\u03a6t |\u03be * \u03b4\u03be0 . By convention,\n0\nif t is a collision time, \u03b4\u03bet denotes a tangent vector immediately before that collision.\n6\n\nWe disregard problems of differentiability which appear for the (rare) tangent collisions.\n\n\f8\n\nTANGENT- SPACE\n\nDYNAMICS\n\n3.1 Numerical procedure and Lyapunov modes\nExtensive numerical simulations are used to establish the classification and dynamics of the\nmodes. Here, we briefly summarize our algorithm described in detail in Refs. [12, 2] and provide\na precise definition of the Lyapunov modes we observe. It is well known that the exponential\ngrowth rate of a typical k-dimensional volume element is given by \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbk ,\n\u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbk = lim\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nlog k\u03b4\u03bet1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03b4\u03betk k.\nt\n\n(4)\n\nIf the tangent vectors \u03b4\u03be 1 , . . . , \u03b4\u03be k are linearly independent at time zero, they will remain so,\nbecause the tangent flow is time reversible. Orthogonality is not preserved by the tangent flow,\nbecause, generally, D\u03a6t is not an orthogonal matrix. However, (4) still holds if the vectors\n\u03b4\u03bet1 , . . . , \u03b4\u03betk are replaced by a (Gram-Schmidt) orthogonalized set of vectors \u03b4\u03b7t1 , . . . , \u03b4\u03b7tk .7 It\ntakes thus the simpler form\nk\n1X\nlog k\u03b4\u03b7ti k .\nt\u2192\u221e t\ni=1\n\n\u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbk = lim\n\n(5)\n\nSince (5) holds for every k \u2264 4N, the exponent \u03bbk turns out to be equal to the growth rate of the\nk th orthogonalized vector \u03b4\u03b7tk .\nThe numerical method of Benettin et al.[13] and Shimada et al.[14] \u2013 and indeed any algorithm \u2013 is based on this construction, although its basic objects are not the \u03b4\u03b7tk vectors. As\ntime increases, they all would get exponentially close to the most-unstable direction, become numerically indistinguishable, and diverge. Instead of orthogonalizing once at time t, the tangent\ndynamics is applied to a set of tangent vectors, which are periodically replaced by an orthogonalized set, that we denote by \u03b4\u03b3t1 , . . . , \u03b4\u03b3tk . The modified dynamics is therefore that of an\northogonal frame [12, 2]. One assumes that (5) is still valid if \u03b4\u03b7tk is replaced by \u03b4\u03b3tk . The k th\nLyapunov mode (or Lyapunov vector) at time t is, by definition, the vector \u03b4\u03b3tk , and it is associated with the exponent \u03bbk .\nOur study starts with the observation that we consider a system with non-trivial Lyapunov\nexponents. To guarantee the convergence of the numerical algorithm, additional properties of the\ndynamical system are needed: Namely, that the system has well-defined local stable and unstable subspaces associated with every Lyapunov exponent (close to zero). Results in this direction\nhave been obtained for hard-disk systems in [15, 16, 17]. A stronger property, hyperbolicity, has\nbeen recently proved for hard disk systems with randomly chosen masses in [18, 19, 20]. We assume here that these results hold for our system as well. As already advocated in Ref. [10], what\nmatters from a physicist's point of view is that the numerical studies behave as if this were true.\nUnder the above assumptions, the k th mode will align with the corresponding unstable subspace.\n7\n\n\u03b4\u03b7tj = \u03b4\u03betj \u2212\n\nPj\u22121\n\nj\ni=1 (\u03b4\u03bet\n\n* \u03b4\u03beti )/(k\u03b4\u03beti k2 )\u03b4\u03beti\n\n\fTANGENT- SPACE\n\n9\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nIn other words, measured modes will be orthogonal spanning sets of the M (j) subspaces defined\nin Eq. (1).\nThe algorithm we use in our numerical work [12, 2] is based on the principles just outlined.\nWe restrict our considerations to hard-disk systems without external interaction. Since there is\nno potential energy, the dynamics is the same at any (total) energy, up to a rescaling of time. The\nnatural unit of time of the system is ((m\u03c3 2 N)/K)1/2 . Throughout, reduced units are used, for\nwhich the particle mass m, the disk diameter \u03c3, and the kinetic energy per particle, K/N, are\nunity. The density, defined by \u03c1 = N/V and the aspect ratio, defined by A = Ly /Lx , are the only\nrelevant macroscopic parameters. Here, V = Lx Ly is the area of the (rectangular) simulation box\nwhose sides are Lx and Ly in the x and y directions, respectively. All our numerical examples\nare for densities \u03c1 \u2264 0.8 characteristic of dense or dilute (if \u03c1 < 0.1) hard disk gases. The results\nare insensitive to the time between successive Gram-Schmidt re-orthonormalization steps.\n3.2 Modes and Oseledec subspaces\nWe have remarked in Sect. 2 that the spaces E (j) of Oseledec' theorem are in general not identical\nto the spaces of the modes M (j) defined in the Eq. (1). Here, we explain this difference.\nThe covariant subspaces E (1) , . . . , E (l) of the Oseledec splitting are obtained as follows [10]:\nthe multiplicative ergodic theorem (for reversible systems) states that the matrices\n1\n\u00b1t\n2|t|\n\u039b\u00b1 (\u03be) \u2261 lim (D\u03a6\u00b1t |T\n\u03be D\u03a6 |\u03be )\nt\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nexist with probability one. The eigenvalues of \u039b+ are exp(\u03bb(1) ) > . . . > exp(\u03bb(l) ) and the\neigenvalues of \u039b\u2212 are exp(\u2212\u03bb(l) ) > . . . > exp(\u2212\u03bb(1) ). Since both \u039b+ and \u039b\u2212 are symmetric,\ntheir eigenspaces define two orthogonal decompositions of the tangent space\nT X = U\u00b1(1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U\u00b1(l) ,\nwhere U\u00b1(j) is the eigenspace of \u039b\u00b1 associated to exp(\u00b1\u03bb(j) ). Note that the U\u00b1(j) subspaces are\npairwise orthogonal but in general not covariant. However, for j \u2208 {1, . . . , l}, the subspaces\nU+(j) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U+(l)\n\nand U\u2212(1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U\u2212(j)\n\nare covariant. They are, respectively, the subspace of the l \u2212 j + 1 most stable directions of\n\u039b+ and the subspace of the j most unstable directions of \u039b\u2212 (or equivalently its j most stable\ndirections in the past). For every \u03be, the invariant subspaces E (j) are then given by\nE (j) = (U\u2212(1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U\u2212(j) ) \u2229 (U+(j) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U+(l) ) .\nThe E (j) spaces are covariant but in general not orthogonal. One can show that\nU\u2212(1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 U\u2212(j) = E (1) \u2295 . . . \u2295 E (j) \u2261 F (j) ,\nwhere F (j) was introduced in Sect. 2. Using the definition (1), one easily verifies that M (j) = U\u2212(j) .\n\n\f10\n\nTANGENT- SPACE\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nRemark 1 In our numerical method, the modes are obtained at the phase points \u03a6t (\u03be0 ) for\nlarge t, i.e., at the end of integrated trajectories. It is therefore consistent that they should contain\ninformation about the past and not the future, that is about \u039b\u2212 and not \u039b+ .\nIn general, U\u2212(j) , U+(j) and E (j) are different. Hard-disk systems have a special property: the\nthree spaces coincide for the Lyapunov exponent \u03bb(m) = 0, where m \u2261 21 (l + 1) is the middle\nindex. We shall denote by N the covariant subspace N = E (m) , also called the null subspace. In\nSect. 4.1, we give the explicit form of N . Using the explicit Jacobians for the particle collisions\nand for the free-streaming motion, as given in [12, 22, 2], one can check that the orthogonal\ncomplement to the null subspace, N \u22a5 , is also covariant. From this statement, one can show that\nN = U+(m) = U\u2212(m) . Our measured modes M (m) = U\u2212(m) therefore span the null space. Since this\nargument seems to fail for j 6= m, we can only conclude that modes of M (j) are perturbations\nwhose exponential growth rate is at least \u03bb(j) .\n3.3 Two simplifications\nTwo additional properties greatly simplify the classification of the modes: the symplecticity of\nthe tangent flow and an observed property \"\u03b4q is proportional to \u03b4p\". The symplecticity of the\ntangent flow means that\nt\nD\u03a6t |T\n(6)\n\u03be J D\u03a6 |\u03be = J ,\nwhere the 4N \u00d7 4N matrix J is defined as8\nJ:\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4p\n\u03b4q\n\n\u0013\n\n7\u2192\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03b4p\n\u03b4q\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03b4q\n\u03b4p\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nAs a consequence of (6), both \u039b+ and \u039b\u2212 are symplectic (see e.g., [21]) and, as is well known,\nLyapunov exponents of Hamiltonian systems come in pairs \u03bb(j), \u03bb(l\u2212j+1) = \u2212\u03bb(j) of equal multiplicity. The matrix J relates the U\u00b1(j) subspaces by\nU\u00b1(j) (\u03be) = JU\u00b1(l\u2212j+1) (\u03be) .\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore, it is sufficient to measure the Lyapunov exponents and the modes for the positive part\nof the spectrum. Note that J is not the (derivative of the) velocity reversal (\u03b4p, \u03b4q) 7\u2192 (\u2212\u03b4p, \u03b4q)\nand does not change the sign of time.\nThe simulations of our system exhibit an additional structure which considerably simplifies\nthe analysis of Lyapunov modes near zero. Unstable perturbations (\u03bb > 0) have the (approximate) form\n\u03b4p = C(\u03be, \u03bb) \u03b4q , C > 0 ,\nwhile the stable (\u03bb < 0) perturbations are of the form\n\u2212C \u2032 (\u03be, \u03bb) \u03b4p = \u03b4q ,\n8\n\nC\u2032 > 0 .\n\nWith the reduced units defined above, positions and velocities are dimensionless.\n\n\fTANGENT- SPACE\n\n11\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nHere, C and C \u2032 are numbers. In the left panel of Fig. 3 we demonstrate that the perturbations \u03b4q\nand \u03b4p associated with each Lyapunov mode are nearly parallel or anti-parallel for large N. The\nEquation (7) also suggest C = C \u2032 , which is well verified by the simulations.\n\n1\n\ncos(\u0398)\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nl\n\nFigure 3: Value of cos(\u0398) = (\u03b4q * \u03b4p)/(|\u03b4q| * |\u03b4p|), as a function of the Lyapunov index l\nfor an instantaneous configuration of the system characterized in Fig. 1. Here, \u0398 is the angle\nbetween the 2N-dimensional vectors of the perturbation components of all particle positions and\nvelocities for a Lyapunov vector \u03bel . For the small positive exponents, for which l < 2N \u2212 2 =\n1558, this angle vanishes, for the small negative exponents, for which l > 2N + 3 = 1563, it\nis equal to \u03c0. For the six zero modes, 1558 \u2264 l \u2264 1563, the angle lies between these limiting\nvalues.\nWe can therefore restrict our classification to the \u03b4q part of the modes corresponding to\npositive exponents. If we can associate every measured exponent \u03bb to a given \u03b4q, then we will\nknow that the exponents \u03bb and \u2212\u03bb correspond to the modes (\u03b4p, \u03b4q) with \u03b4p = C\u03b4q and \u03b4p =\n\u2212C \u22121 \u03b4q, respectively.\n3.4 Tangent vectors as vector fields\nThe components of a tangent vector \u03b4\u03be = (\u03b4p, \u03b4q) are the perturbation components of the positions and velocities of all particles. As a graphical representation of such a vector, we show\nin the left panel of Fig. 4 the instantaneous positional perturbations of all particles at their positions in physical space, where the arrows indicate the directions and strengths. It belongs to\na Lyapunov exponent \u03bb1546 indicated by the enlarged circle in Fig. 5. A qualitatively identical\nfigure is obtained, if the positional displacements of all particles are replaced by their momentum displacements, as explained in Sect. 3.3. Thus, this figure is a complete representation of\nthe Lyapunov vector \u03b4\u03be = (\u03b4p, \u03b4q) belonging to \u03bb1546 in Fig. 5. The transverse modes for \u03bb1549\non the left panel of Fig. 2, and for \u03bb1548 at the bottom left panel of Fig. 6, are other examples of\n\n\f12\n\nTANGENT- SPACE\n\nDYNAMICS\n\n\u03b4x(\u03bb1546)\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n1\n\nl =1546\n\n20\n\n\u03b4y\n\ny\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b4y(\u03bb1546)\n\n0.04\n0\n-0.04\n0.04\n\n10\n\n\u03b4x\n\n0\n0\n\n-0.04\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n20\n\n0\n10\n\nx\n\nx\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n\ny\n\n0\n\nFigure 4: The transverse mode T(1,1) for \u03bb1546 of Fig. 5.

For this reason, we assign the node\nx\ny\nnumbers (nx , ny ) = (1, 1) to this mode.\nTo be more precise, let r = (x, y) \u2208 [0, Lx ) \u00d7 [0, Ly ). We say that a two-dimensional smooth\nvector field \u03c6 = (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) over the position space, is sampled by the infinitesimal displacements\n\u03b4q of the N disks at their reference positions q, when\n\u03c6(qj ) = \u03b4qj , for all j = 1, . . . , N .\nThinking of a tangent vector in terms of an associated vector field is meaningful if there are \"sufficiently\" many particles to sample the field on a typical length scale of its variation. Once this\ncondition breaks down for larger exponents, as it will for large-enough k, the modes disappear9 ,\nand so do the steps in the Lyapunov spectrum. In the following we use a notation which does not\ndistinguish between tangent vectors and their two-dimensional vector fields.\n9\n\nand the sampled vector field is ill-defined.\n\n\fO BSERVATION\n\n1.4\n\nT (2,0)\n\n0.6\n\nL\n\n1.2\n\nLP(0,1)\nT (1,1)\nLP(1,0)\n\n1\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.8\n\n1.4\n\nLP(1,1)\n\n1.2\n1\n\n13\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\nT (0,1)\nT (1,0)\n\n0.8\n\nT\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n(1,0) (0,1)\n\n0\n1530\n\n(1,1)\n\n(2,0)\n\n0\n1535\n\n1540\n\n1545\nl\n\n1550\n\n1555\n\n1560\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n|k|\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 5: Lyapunov spectrum and \"dispersion relations\" for the 780-disk system characterized in\nFig. 1, and the density \u03c1 = 0.8.

The respective labels L and T\nrefer to the longitudinal and transverse branches.\n\n4 Observation and description of the modes\nIn this section, we describe the Lyapunov spectrum near 0 and the corresponding modes, as they\nare measured in numerical experiments. In the two following subsections, we will explain how\nthese modes can be understood on the basis of symmetry breaking of \"zero modes\".\nWe illustrate our assertions with the system already introduced in Fig. 1, which contains\nN = 780 particles in a rectangular periodic box with an aspect ratio Ly /Lx = 0.867. It corresponds to a hard-disk gas with a density \u03c1 = 0.8, slightly below the fluid-to-solid phase transition\ndensity [12]. The left panel of Fig. 5 provides a magnified view of the smallest positive Lyapunov\nexponents for this system.10 The exponents, ordered by size and repeated with their multiplicities, are plotted as a function of their index. Degenerate exponents with a multiplicity d \u2265 2\nappear therefore as \"steps\". To account for the wave-like appearance of the modes, we associate\nwith each Lyapunov vector a wave number k(nx ,ny ) , as in (2), where the non-negative integers\nn = (nx , ny ) count the nodes in the respective directions.11\nWhen the small Lyapunov exponents are plotted as a function of their corresponding wave\nnumber, they all lie on two curves, sometimes referred to as \"dispersion relations\" [2, 8]. This is\n10\n\nThe conjugate negative exponents are not shown, see [2, 8].\nIn many cases, the number of nodes is easy to determine, as in Fig. 4. To facilitate an objective identification of\nthe wave vectors modes associated with larger exponents, which are noisier, Fourier-transforms are used.\n11\n\n\f14\n\nO BSERVATION\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\ndemonstrated on the right panel of Fig. 5. On this plot, degenerate exponents are represented by\na single point. For reasons discussed below, the upper branch is called longitudinal (L), and the\nlower transverse (T). It is experimentally found that for a given wave number, the multiplicity of\nthe L branch is twice that of the T branch, as mentioned already in Sect. 2.\n4.1 Vanishing Lyapunov exponents\nWe start our description with the six modes associated with the six vanishing Lyapunov exponents, commonly referred to as zero modes. Four of them are induced by the homogeneity of\nspace, and two are consequences of the homogeneity of time. They span a six-dimensional subspace N (\u03be) of the tangent space, T X(\u03be), at any phase point \u03be.12 These 6 zero modes play a\nfundamental role in understanding the nature of the modes associated with Lyapunov exponents\nclose to zero.\nIn order to show which symmetries give rise to the zero modes, we list in Table 1 the six\ncorresponding elementary transformations. This defines the six zero modes \u03b4\u03be1 to \u03b4\u03be6 in a notation that separates the x and y components of \u03b4p and \u03b4q. The vectors \u03b4\u03be1 and \u03b4\u03be2 correspond to a\nperturbation of the total momentum in the x and y directions, \u03b4\u03be3 and \u03b4\u03be4 to an (infinitesimal) uniform translation of the origin, \u03b4\u03be5 to a change of energy, and \u03b4\u03be6 to a change of the origin of time.\n\nTransformation\n\nGenerator\n\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px + \u03b51, py , qx , qy )\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px , py + \u03b51, qx , qy )\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px , py , qx + \u03b51, qy )\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px , py , qx , qy + \u03b51)\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px + \u03b5px , py + \u03b5py , qx , qy )\n(p, q) 7\u2192 (px , py , qx + \u03b5px , qy + \u03b5py )\n\n\u03b4\u03be1\n\u03b4\u03be2\n\u03b4\u03be3\n\u03b4\u03be4\n\u03b4\u03be5\n\u03b4\u03be6\n\n= (1, 0, 0, 0)\n= (0, 1, 0, 0)\n= (0, 0, 1, 0)\n= (0, 0, 0, 1)\n= (px , py , 0, 0)\n= (0, 0, px , py )\n\nTable 1: Central subspace for the vanishing Lyapunov exponents.

It thus coincides with the null space N (\u03be) of\nSect. 3.2.\nRemark 2 The space N (\u03be) can be further decomposed into three covariant subspaces Nx =\nSpan{\u03b4\u03be1 , \u03b4\u03be3 }, Ny = Span{\u03b4\u03be2 , \u03b4\u03be4} and Np = Span{\u03b4\u03be5 , \u03b4\u03be6}, each of which independently\nsatisfies the properties listed for N (\u03be).

If only the x\ndirection is periodic [6], the space of zero modes is reduced to Nx \u2295 Np .\n4.2 Longitudinal, Transverse and P-modes\nFollowing our argument of Sect. 3.3, we need only describe the \u03b4q part of the modes. Therefore,\nwe consider the three transformations (see Table 1)\n\u03b4\u03be3 : (qx,j , qy,j ) 7\u2192 (qx,j + \u03b5, qy,j )\n\u03b4\u03be4 : (qx,j , qy,j ) 7\u2192 (qx,j , qy,j + \u03b5)\n\u03b4\u03be6 : (qx,j , qy,j ) 7\u2192 (qx,j + \u03b5px,j , qy,j + \u03b5py,j ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nassociated to zero modes, and claim the following :\nModes Classification I: Modes of wave number kn are scalar modulations of (8) with wave\nnumber kn . More precisely, they are obtained by replacing \u03b5 with \u03b5 A(qx,j , qy,j ) in (8), where the\nreal scalar function A is of the form\nA(x, y) =\n\nX\n\ncl,m exp (i(l kx x + m ky y)) .\n\n|l|=nx ,|m|=ny\n\nThe space of such modulations has dimension 4 in general and dimension 2 if either nx or ny\nvanishes.\nExample 3 We consider n = (1, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 1). We use the notation cx = cos(kx x),\nsx = cos(kx x), cy = cos(ky y) and sy = sin(ky y). A basis of the space of functions with wave\nnumber kn is shown in Table 2. Of course, this choice fixes a constant phase for the sine and\ncosine functions.\nn\n(1, 0)\n(0, 1)\n(1, 1)\n\nFunction A\ndim\ncx , sx\n2\ncy , sy\n2\ncx cy , sx cy , cx sy , sx sy 4\n\nTable 2: Functions with wave number kn\nIf the Lyapunov exponent were a function of kn only, we would expect 12-fold degeneracy\nin Fig. 5, (resp. 6-fold if either nx or ny = 0), since each of the three perturbations of (8) can be\nmodulated by the four (resp. two) functions of Table 2. However, this degeneracy is broken into\nan 8+4 (resp. 4+2) structure:\nMode Classification II: The Lyapunov vectors of wave number kn have two possible Lyapunov\nexponents: |\u03bb| = cT |kn | or |\u03bb| = cL |kn |, corresponding to the Transverse or Longitudinal\nbranch of Fig. 5. The modes for these two branches are obtained as follows:\n\n\f16\n\nO BSERVATION\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\n1) Transverse branch: transverse modes are obtained by combining the modulations of \u03b4\u03be3\nand \u03b4\u03be4 in a divergence-free vector field. We denote by T(n) the space of such vector fields.\n2) Longitudinal branch:\n(i) Longitudinal modes are irrotational vector fields one obtains by combining the modulations of \u03b4\u03be3 and \u03b4\u03be4 . We denote the corresponding space by L(n).\n(ii) P-modes are modulations of \u03b4\u03be6 , and we denote the corresponding subspace by P(n).\nThe three subspaces T(n), L(n) and P(n) have dimension 4 (or dimension 2 if either nx or ny\nvanishes). We denote by LP(n) \u2261 L(n) \u2295 P(n) the subspace corresponding to the Longitudinal\nbranch. It has dimension 8 (4 if either nx or ny vanishes).\nRemark 4 The divergence and curl of a vector field \u03c6 = (\u03c6x , \u03c6y ) are, of course,\n\u2207 * \u03c6 = \u2202x \u03c6x + \u2202y \u03c6y ,\n\n\u2207 \u2227 \u03c6 = \u2202x \u03c6y \u2212 \u2202y \u03c6x .\n\nSince every two-dimensional vector field uniquely decomposes into a sum of a divergence-free\nand an irrotational vector field, the spaces L(n) and T(n) span all possible two-dimensional\nvector fields of wave number kn .\nThere is a simple way to build P(n), L(n) and T(n) from the scalar modulations of Table 2.\nIf A is a modulation of wave number kn , then we have\npA \u2208 P(n) , \u2207A \u2208 L(n) , \u2207 \u2227 A \u2208 T(n) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere by definition\n\u2202 A\n,\n\u2207A = x\n\u2202y A\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2202y A\n.\n\u2207\u2227A=\n\u2212\u2202x A\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nThis construction is also useful because it naturally defines what we shall call LP pairs, by\nwhich we denote a field of L(n) and a field of P(n) originating from the same scalar modulation,\nas in (9). We show below that LP pairs play an important role. Indeed, when only some of the\nmodes are present because of the boundary conditions, LP pairs are never broken: both fields are\npresent, or both are missing (see Sect. 4.3). We shall also see in Sect. 5 that the dynamics of the\nmodes mostly takes place between LP pairs.\nExample 5 For the three modes of lowest wave number, Table 3 lists a basis of T(n), L(n) and\nP(n). Fields are given in a non-normalized form to keep notation short. Corresponding L(n)\nfields and P(n) fields are LP pairs. Fig. 6 provides examples for T and L-modes.\nModes of L(n) and T(n) are wavelike perturbations of the position space, and, therefore, are\nsimilar to the modes that appear in hydrodynamics (see Sect. 7). In particular, when either nx or\nny vanish, the fields of L(n) and T(n) are, respectively, longitudinal and transverse to the wave\n\n\fO BSERVATION\n\nBasis of T(n)\n\nn\n\n17\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\nBasis of L(n)\n\nBasis of P(n)\n\n(1, 0)\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n0\n,\nsx\ncx\n\u0013 \u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\ncx\ns\n, x\n0\n0\n\u0013 \u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\npx\np\nsx , x cx\npy\npy\n\n(0, 1)\n\n\u0012\n\ncy\ns\n, y\n0\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n0\n,\nsy\ncy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\npx\np\ns , x c\npy y py y\n\n(1, 1)\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nc s \u0013 \u0012 k1 sx cy \u0013\nkx x y\nx\n,\n\u2212 k1 sx cy\n\u2212 k1 cx sy\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nky\n1\nkx\n\n\u0012\n\npx\np\nsx sy , x cx cy\npy\npy\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nkx\n1\nky\n\n\u0012\n\n1\ns s \u0013 \u0012 k1 cx cy \u0013\nky x y\ny\n,\n\u2212 k1 cx cy\n\u2212 k1 sx sy\nx\nx\n\n\u0012\n\npx\np\nc s , x s c\npy x y py x y\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\ny\n\ny\n\nsx sy\n,\ncx cy\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\n1\nkx\n1\nky\n\ncx cy\nsx sy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\ncx sy \u0013 \u0012 k1 sx cy \u0013\n, 1y\nsx cy\ncx sy\nk\nx\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\nTable 3: Decomposition of n-modes for rectangular systems with periodic boundaries.\nvector. This observation is the reason for the names of the two branches in Fig. 5. To stay in line\nwith this now-accepted terminology, we keep it also for the case nx * ny 6= 0. P-modes are more\ncomplex than the other modes, because they depend not only on the positions of the perturbed\nparticles but also on their velocities.\nAt this point we are able to characterize the spectrum and its multiplicities with only two\nconstants, cL and cT , which have the physical dimension of velocities. We shall see in Sect. 6\nthat these velocities depend on the density of the system, but are insensitive to the system size,\nthe boundary type, and the aspect ratio. Therefore, it is tempting to think of cL and cT as thermodynamic velocities. However, as discussed in Sect. 6, no obvious interpretation could be found\nso far.\n4.3 Other aspect ratios and boundary conditions\nWe summarize here some observations which concern different boundary conditions and degeneracies.\ni) The Lyapunov spectrum is more degenerate for square systems, for which k(nx ,ny ) = k(ny ,nx ) .\nIn this case the multiplicities are doubled with respect to the general case, for which nx 6=\nny . Other \"accidental\" degeneracies may occur: for instance, parameters can be found for\nwhich cT |k(1,1) | = cL |k(1,0) |.\nii) Systems with reflecting boundaries [6] develop only a subset of the modes encountered so\nfar, which can be found by the following simple, and obvious, rules:\n\u2022 The fundamental wave vectors are kx =\n\n\u03c0\nLx\n\nand ky =\n\n\u03c0\nLy\n\n(not 2\u03c0).

This follows, since a vector field varying along the y axis cannot be\nsampled by a single particle. Therefore, the Lyapunov spectrum of such a system is greatly\nsimplified, since the modes are restricted to L(nx , 0) and T(nx , 0).\nExample 6 Table 4 shows which modes of Table 3 satisfy the Dirichlet condition and are thus\npresent in a system with reflecting boundaries.14 We stress that such a system has only two\nvanishing Lyapunov exponents which are associated with \u03b4\u03be5 and \u03b4\u03be6 of Table 1. Therefore,\nmodes appear which are not modulations of zero modes of the system. The crucial observation\nhere is that even if one of the fundamental symmetries is broken by the boundary condition,\nthe modulation, as defined in Eq. (9), may still satisfy that boundary condition. For example,\nif we have reflecting boundaries on the walls {x = 0} and {x = Lx }, then any perturbation\nA(x, y) = sin(mkx x)B(y) will be acceptable, whereas, of course, A(x, y) = cos(mkx x)B(y)\nwould not.\nSystems with reflecting boundaries and narrow systems are easier to study numerically, because the multiplicities of the L, P and T spaces are smaller than in the periodic rectangular case.\nIn particular, the LP(1,1) space has only dimension 2 when the boundaries are reflecting. For\nthat reason, we illustrate some of the issues below also with the \"reflecting-wall version\" of the\n780-disk system introduced in Fig. 8.\n13\n\nRecall that \u03c3 is the diameter of the disks.\nFor such a choice of basis vectors the origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom-left corner of the simulation box.\n14\n\n\f20\n\nO BSERVATION\n\nT(n)\n\nn\n\nL(n)\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\nP(n)\n\n(1, 0) none\n\n\u0012\n\nsx\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\npx\nc\npy x\n\n(0, 1) none\n\n\u0012\n\n0\nsy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\npx\nc\npy y\n\n\u0012\n\nsx cy\ncx sy\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\n(1, 1)\n\n\u0012\n\nsx cy\n\u2212cx sy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\npx\nc c\npy x y\n\u0013\n\nTable 4: Mode decomposition for rectangular systems with reflecting boundaries.\n4.4 How to measure P-modes\nContrary to L(n) and T(n), the tangent subspace P(n) depends on the state that it perturbs.\nMoreover, modes of P(n) are not really vector fields, because the velocities of the particles in a\ntypical configuration do not depend smoothly on position. In order to \"see\" a P-mode, we face\ntwo problems:\ni) A typical measured vector of an LP(n) space is a superposition of vectors of L(n) and P(n).\nii) Even when a mode of P(n) is isolated, it is not smooth and does not \"look like\" a vector\nfield over the box.\nWe explain our solution to the first problem with the simplest possible example: the LP(1, 0)\nspace for a rectangular system with reflecting boundaries (see Sect. 4.3). This space has dimension two and is defined by the two normalized spanning vectors\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6Lx\n\u03c6Ly\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n=\nz1\n\n\u0012\n\nsx\n,\n0\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6Px\n\u03c6Py\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n=\nz2\n\n\u0012\n\npx\nc ,\npy x\n\u0013\n\nkx =\n\n\u03c0\n,\nLx\n\n(10)\n\nwhere z1 and z2 are normalization constants. At any time t, we have two measured modes, \u03c8 1 and\n\u03c8 2 (vectors with 2N components, since only the \u03b4q part is observed), whose span is (numerically\nvery close to) LP(1, 0). Therefore, there are constants a, b, c, d with\n\u03c6L = \u03c8 1 a + \u03c8 2 b ,\n\u03c6P = \u03c8 1 c + \u03c8 2 d .\n\n(11)\n\nSince all these vectors are normalized, one should also have a2 + b2 = c2 + d2 = 1. However,\nEq. (11) is over-determined: four constants have to satisfy 4N equations. Numerically, we use\na least-square method to find the best values for a,b,c and d, which we denote by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4.15\n15\n\nIt is also possible to use a simple projection \u03b1 = \u03c6L * \u03c8 1 , etc. This method assumes that \u03c6L and \u03c6P are\northogonal vectors, which they only are approximately.\n\n\f21\n\nAND DESCRIPTION OF THE MODES\n\n0.06\n\n0.06\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\u03b4qy\n\n\u03b4qx\n\nO BSERVATION\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n20\n\n30\n\nqx\n\n0.06\n\n0.06\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\u03b4qy/py\n\n\u03b4qx/px\n\nqx\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.03\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.06\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n\nqx\n\nqx\n\nFigure 7: Example for the P-mode reconstruction for the 4-dimensional LP(1,0) space of a system\nwith periodic boundaries.

We take this case as an example to\nillustrate in Fig. 7 our method of mode reconstruction: from the four measured modes the\nanalogue to Eq. (11) generates four spanning vectors, namely two L-modes (one of which\nis shown at the top-right position of Fig. 4) and two P-modes. The x and y components\nof one of the P-modes, namely \u03c6\u0303P \u2248 psx , are shown in the top row of Fig. 7. No smooth\nfunctions are recognized. However, after dividing by the momentum components, px,j and\npy,j , as required by (12), the figures for the fields \u03c6\u0303Px /px and \u03c6\u0303Py /py in the bottom row of\nFig. 7 clearly display the expected sx -dependence.\nii) Division by px,j or py,j in (12) is numerically unstable when particle j has a very small\nmomentum along a coordinate axis. We avoid this by multiplying instead by px,j /(p2x,j + \u03b5),\nwhere \u03b5 \u226a 1. One could also ignore particle j in this case and only sample the field at those\npoints where both px,j and py,j are not too small.\n\n5 Dynamics of the modes\nRemark The interested reader can look up animated pictures on the web at the address\nhttp://theory.physics.unige.ch/modes/ .\nIn this section we turn to the \"dynamics of the modes\" and study what has been called the\nvelocity of the longitudinal modes [2, 5, 7]. This might clarify hydrodynamic theories [4, 5],\nwhich are mostly based on a partial classification of the modes. In numerical simulations, the\ntransverse modes are stationary in space and time: although the particles move, the vector-field\nof the mode does not. In other words, at any instant of time, the vector field of a T-mode does\nnot move (up to a small jitter due to numerical noise).\nFor longitudinal modes, however, one seems to observe [24] a propagation in the direction of\nthe wave vector.16 Using the geometrical picture developed above, we can interpret this motion\nand also explain why no propagation is observed for the LP dynamics in systems with reflecting\nboundaries as demonstrated in Fig. 8 below.\n16\n\nwhen either nx or ny vanish, for instance in the L(1, 0) or L(0, 1) space.\n\n\fDYNAMICS\n\n23\n\nOF THE MODES\n\n\u03c6P\n\u03c6L\n\nl=1553\n\nl=1554\n\nl=1553\n\nl=1554\n\nl=1553\n\nl=1554\n\nl=1553\n\nl=1554\n\n\u03c6L\n\n-\u03c6P\n\n-\u03c6L\n\n-\u03c6P\n\n\u03c6P\n-\u03c6L\n\nFigure 8: LP(1,1) dynamics for a system of 780 disks in a box with an aspect ratio 0.867, a\ndensity 0.8, and with reflecting boundaries. Left: coordinates of the measured fields in the\n\"standard basis\" of LP(1,1). The (unit) circle is nearly reached, showing that indeed \u03c8 1 and \u03c8 2\nspan the same subspace as \u03c6L and \u03c6P . Center and right: the measured fields \u03c8 1 (t) and \u03c8 2 (t).\nThe rows from top to bottom are consecutive snapshots separated by time steps of \u2206t = 3.20,\nwhich corresponds to a phase shift of \u03c0/2 in the LP(1,1) rotation.\n\n\f24\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nOF THE MODES\n\nSince multiplicities are not so essential here, we illustrate the interpretation for the (simpler)\nLP(1, 0) space of a rectangular system with reflecting boundaries (dimension 2). In Sect. 4.4 we\npointed out that at any given time t, where the state is \u03bet , the measured modes \u03c8 1 (t) and \u03c8 2 (t)\nare combinations of the two spanning vectors \u03c6L (\u03bet ) and \u03c6P (\u03bet ). We re-write Eq. (11) in matrix\nform, but now with explicit time dependence:\nL\n\nP\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(\u03c6 (\u03bet ), \u03c6 (\u03bet )) = (\u03c8 (t), \u03c8 (t)) * Q(t) ,\n\nQ(t) =\n\n\u0012\n\na(t)\nc(t)\n\nb(t)\nd(t)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nTherefore, the dynamics of the modes reduces to that of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix Q(t). In our simulations\nwe keep the spanning vectors orthonormal. Since (in the experiment) the two fields \u03c6L and \u03c6P\nare also (nearly) orthogonal17 , the matrix Q(t) is close to a rotation matrix (that is c \u2243 \u2212b,\nd \u2243 a, and a2 + b2 \u2243 1). Therefore, the dynamics in the two-dimensional subspace is well\ndescribed by a phase \u03c6(t) = arctan(b(t)/a(t)).\nLP-dynamics in 2 dimensions: The matrix Q(t) is a rotation with constant angular velocity\n\u03c9n . This velocity is proportional to the wave number kn , namely\n\u03c6(t) = \u03c9n t = v kn t .\nHere, v is the product of a frequency and a wavelength and, therefore, is a velocity. According\nto the simulations, v depends only on the density of the system.\n\nExample 7 In Fig. 8 we demonstrate this rotation in the LP(1,0) space of a system with reflecting\nboundaries. Snapshots of the two measured fields at consecutive times show the rotation of the\ntwo vectors between the L and the P direction.\nA similar rotation has been found in narrow systems in [6] and explained in [5, 7] in the low\ndensity limit using a Boltzmann-equation approach.\n\nRemark 8 The velocity v = \u03c9n /|kn | has been interpreted earlier [24] as the phase velocity of\na traveling wave in physical space. In Appendix B we demonstrate how the two interpretations\ncan be reconciled. The definitions given above allow us to apply the same concepts also to the\nLP-dynamics of systems with reflecting boundaries, although they do not show traveling but\nstanding waves.\n\n17\n\nThe scalar product \u03c6L * \u03c6P = \u03a3N\nj=1 cos(kx qj,x ) sin(kx qj,x )pj,x a priori does not vanish. However, as the\nsimulations show, it is of the same order as \u03a3N\nj=1 cos(kx qj,x ) sin(kx qj,x ), which is also small and non-vanishing due\nto the uneven spacing of the particles.\n\n\fI NFLUENCE\n\n25\n\nOF GEOMETRY AND SYSTEM SIZE\n\n300\n\n5\n\n250\n-5\n5\n\u2206phase[%]\n\nphase/|k|\n\n200\n\nLP(10)\n\n150\n\nLP(01)\n\n-5\n\n100\n5\n50\n\nLP(0,1)\nLP(1,0)\nLP(1,1)\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n-5\n25\n\nt\n\nLP(11)\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nt\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 9: Rotations of various LP pairs for the 780-disk system of Fig. 1.

For clarity, the phases for different modes are separated by multiples of 2\u03c0/|kn|.\nRight: The fluctuations around the constant velocity (in percent of 2\u03c0). For details we refer to\nthe main text.\n\nNext, we consider the dynamics for the general case of a 2d-fold degenerate LP(n) space.\nAs explained in Sect. 4, an LP(n) space is defined by a spanning set of d longitudinal modes,\n\u03c6L1 , . . . , \u03c6Ld , and d P-modes, \u03c6P1 , . . . , \u03c6Pd , where each pair (\u03c6Lk , \u03c6Pk ) is an LP pair. The following\ndescription is valid for any type of boundary conditions:\nDynamics in LP(n): The dynamics in LP(n), when restricted to a two-dimensional subspace\nspanned by an LP pair\nSpan{\u03c6Lk , \u03c6Pk },\nis a two-dimensional rotation at a constant angular velocity \u00b1\u03c9n , where \u03c9n = v kn , with v independent of n.\n\nExample 9 The LP dynamics for higher-dimensional spaces is illustrated in Fig. 9. In the following we concentrate on LP(1,1). This space has dimension 8, that is four LP pairs. Generically,\na measured mode has a non-vanishing projection onto all four LP pairs, and four different phases\ncan be defined. The four time series of phases for LP(1,1) in Fig. 9 belong to different projections\nof the same mode.\n\n6 Influence of geometry and system size\nIn this section we study what influence the density, aspect ratio, and boundary conditions have\non cT , cL , and v. The density dependence is significant.

The smooth lines are polynomial fits added to guide the eyes. Although\nthe fits have no theoretical basis, we provide the fit parameters for convenience: cL = 0.790 +\n0.970\u03c1 + 0.785\u03c12 + 6.24\u03c14 , and cT = 0.902 + 1.050\u03c1 \u2212 0.053\u03c12 + 3.85\u03c14 . Right: Almost linear\nrelations between all three quantities.\n\nexplanation for this fact. In particular, comparisons with the sound velocity [25], with the mean\nfree path, and with similar quantities, do not suggest simple relationships. Thus, these questions\nhave to await further studies.\nThe results of our simulations are summarized in Fig. 10. In the left panel, cL and cT , defined\nin Sect. 2, are shown as functions of \u03c1, and on the right panel v and cT are plotted as functions\nof cL . There are two observations which are of interest: First, as seen in the left panel, cT and cL\ncross for lower densities. Thus, the intuitively natural conjecture, cL \u2265 cT , is not supported by\nthe numerical evidence. Second, the three \"velocities\" cT , cL , and v are almost linearly related.\nIn particular, the phase velocity v agrees rather well with cL for fluid densities \u03c1 < 0.6 (see the\nfull line in the right panel of Fig. 10), thus lending support to referring to the curves \u03bb(k) as\n\"dispersion relations\".\nOn the left panel of Fig. 11 we plot the longitudinal and transverse dispersion relations for\na moderately-dense gas with a density \u03c1 = 0.4. The full and open points are for systems with\nperiodic and reflecting boundaries, respectively. In all cases, \u03bb was determined from the lowest\nstep of the Lyapunov spectrum for the system, for which the aspect ratio varied between 0.5 and\n1, and the particle number between 400 and 800. The figure demonstrates that periodic and reflecting boundary conditions give the same \u03bb(k). We have experimentally verified (but not shown\n\n\fI NFLUENCE\n0.3\n\n27\n\nOF GEOMETRY AND SYSTEM SIZE\n\n2\n\nreflecting\nperiodic\n\nreflecting\nperiodic\n\nL\n\n0.2\n\n1.6\nL\n\ncL,cT\n\n\u03bb\n\nT\n\nT\n0.1\n1.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n|k|\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nA\n\nFigure 11: Simulation results for a hard-disk gas with a density \u03c1 = 0.4.

Left: The smallest\npositive Lyapunov exponent for T and L-modes, respectively, as a function of the wave-number\nk. The curves for periodic and reflecting boundary conditions agree. To the second order in k,\na fit to the data gives cL = 1.422k + 0.55k 2 and cT = 1.412k + 0.086k 2. Right: The slopes, cL\nand cT , are plotted as a function of the aspect ratio A of the simulation box. For a given A we\ncompare points with the same k to eliminate the influence of the nonlinearity of the dispersion\nrelations. This means that for periodic boundaries the linear extensions of the simulation box,\nLx and Ly , are twice those of the respective reflecting box. The data for periodic and reflecting\nboundaries agree to within numerical accuracy.\n\nhere) that the same is true also for larger and lower densities.\nThe situation becomes a little more complicated when we consider the dependence of the\nslopes, cL and cT , on the aspect ratio A, as we do in the right panel of Fig. 11. The dispersion\ncurves are not strictly linear in k, as we have pointed out already in a footnote in Sect. 2. A fit\nto the points in the left panel of Fig. 11 reveals that the term proportional to k 2 is much larger\nfor L than for T. To eliminate this nonlinearity in a comparison of the slopes for reflecting and\nperiodic systems with a given A, modes with the same values for k 18 are used in the right\npanel of Fig. 11. With this precaution the figure demonstrates that the slopes of the dispersion\nrelations do not depend on the boundary conditions in any significant way, as long as the box\ndoes not degenerate to a narrow channel [23]. Except for this particular case, the nonlinearity\nof the dispersion curves has no noticeable influence on the classification and description of the\nLyapunov modes in this paper and has been accordingly ignored.\n18\n\nThe smallest wave number k for periodic boundaries is given by 2\u03c0/L, where L is a dimension of the box. For\nreflecting boundaries, k is given by \u03c0/L, where L is an effective box size, namely the size reduced by a particle\ndiameter \u03c3.\n\n\f28\n\nH YDRODYNAMIC\n\nEQUIVALENT OF THE MODES\n\n7 Hydrodynamic equivalent of the modes\nThere is a general expectation that the Lyapunov modes should be related to the hydrodynamic\nbehavior of the system, and several papers point in this direction [3, 4, 5, 6]. It should be noted,\nhowever, that none of these studies has reached a totally convincing interpretation, and, furthermore, it is obvious from this body of work that the LP-modes are more difficult to explain than\nthe T-modes. Here, we add to this a simple calculation which might be helpful in the future: we\ndetermine how the modes perturb the hydrodynamic fields or, in other words, what would be the\nhydrodynamic equivalent of the modes we measure. The results, given in Table 5, have quite a\nsimple form, but do not reproduce the usual modes of hydrodynamics.\nConsider a general transformation T of the one-particle phase space \u03bc \u2261 [0, Lx )\u00d7[0, Ly )\u00d7R2\ngiven by\n(\nr 7\u2192 r \u2032 = r + \u03b5 \u03b4\u03be(r, v)\nT :\n,\nv 7\u2192 v \u2032 = v + \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b7(r, v)\nand f a probability density over \u03bc.

Since we study equilibrium dynamics, we assume, furthermore, that f is the\nBoltzmann distribution19. By Sect. 3.3 we also have \u03b4\u03b7 = C\u03b4\u03be, and, therefore, (13) simplifies to\n\u03b4f = \u2212f (\u2207r * \u03b4\u03be + C\u2207v * \u03b4\u03be \u2212 Cv * \u03b4\u03be) .\nWe define the variations of the three hydrodynamic fields (density \u03c1, momentum u, and energy\nE) by\n\u03b4\u03c1(r) =\n\nZ\n\ndv \u03b4f (r, v) ,\n\n\u03b4u(r) =\n\nZ\n\ndv \u03b4f (r, v) v ,\n\n\u03b4E(r) =\n\nZ\n\ndv \u03b4f (r, v) |v|2 .\n\nmode\n\u03b4\u03be\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4u\n\u03b4E\nT\n\u2207\u2227A 0 \u2207\u2227A 0\nL\n\u2207A \u2206A \u2207A \u2206A\nP\nvA\n0\n\u2207A\nA\nTable 5: Modulations of the hydrodynamic fields (multiplicative constants are omitted)\nFor each of the three types of modes, one can compute these quantities as a function of the\nscalar modulation A introduced in (9). The results are given in Table 5. Since \u2206A = \u2212kn2 A, we\nnote that the scalar fields \u03b4\u03c1 and \u03b4E are proportional to the initial scalar modulation A. Note also\nthat the energy field is only affected by the L and P-modes but not by the T-mode.\n19\n\nwith kB T = 1 as in the simulations\n\n\fT RANSFORMATION\n\nOF THE ONE - PARTICLE DISTRIBUTION\n\n29\n\n8 Conclusions\nThe picture developed in this paper is for two-dimensional hard disks, but the method is sufficiently geometric and general to allow easy extensions to other systems:\nFor example, the generalization to three-dimensional hard disks is straightforward. The existence of L and T-modes for this case has been confirmed by computer simulation [25]. Recently,\nLyapunov modes were also found for two-dimensional soft-particle systems interacting either\nwith a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potential [26] or a Lennard-Jones potential [27, 28]. It would\nalso be interesting to extend the work to, say, circular geometries. Another extension concerns\nlinear molecules such as hard dumbbells in a periodic box [1, 11]. In this case two qualitatively\ndifferent degrees of freedom play a role, translation and rotation. The existence of modes has\nalready been demonstrated in this case.\nWe have ended our wanderings through the rich landscape of Lyapunov modes. To summarize, we have carefully identified and analyzed the modes, giving a beginning of a theoretical\nclassification. Furthermore, we have seen that the Lyapunov exponents and the phase velocity\nof the LP-modes seem to be functions of the density alone. In particular, they are practically independent of the aspect ratio of the box (and, where applicable, also insensitive to the boundary\nconditions).\n\n9 Acknowledgments\nFinancial support from the Austrian Science Foundation (FWF), project P15348, and the Fonds\nNational Suisse is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nA\n\nTransformation of the one-particle distribution\n\nLet f be a given distribution.
