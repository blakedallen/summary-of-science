Let X be a scheme and let g be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, both\ndefined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero and both equipped\nwith the action of a finite group \u0393 by automorphisms. The equivariant map algebra\nM = M (X, g)\u0393 is the Lie algebra of regular maps X \u2192 g which are equivariant with\nrespect to the action of \u0393. Denoting by A the coordinate ring of X, an equivariant\nmap algebra can also be realized as the fixed point Lie algebra M = (g \u2297 A)\u0393 with\nrespect to the diagonal action of \u0393 on g \u2297 A. The purpose of the current paper is\nto classify the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of such algebras.\nOne important class of examples of equivariant map algebras are the (twisted)\nloop algebras which play a crucial role in the theory of affine Lie algebras. The description of the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of loop algebras goes\nback to the work of Chari and Pressley [Cha86], [CP86], [CP98]. Their work has\nhad a long-lasting impact. Generalizations and more precise descriptions of their\nwork have appeared in many papers, for example in Batra [Bat04], Chari-FourierKhandai [CFK], Chari-Fourier-Senesi [CFS08], Chari-Moura [CM04], Feigin-Loktev\nReceived by the editors April 12, 2010.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 17B10, 17B20, 17B65.\nThe first and second authors gratefully acknowledge support from NSERC through their respective Discovery grants.

Other examples of equivariant map algebras whose irreducible finite-dimensional representations have been\nclassified are the Onsager algebra [DR00] and the tetrahedron algebra (or threepoint sl2 loop algebra) [Har07]. In all these papers it was proven, sometimes using\ncomplicated combinatorial or algebraic arguments and sometimes without explicitly stating so, that all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation\nrepresentations.\nIn the current paper, we provide a complete classification of the irreducible finitedimensional representations of an arbitrary equivariant map algebra. This class of\nLie algebras includes all the aforementioned examples, and we obtain classification results in these cases with greatly simplified proofs. However, the class of Lie\nalgebras covered by the results of this paper is infinitely larger than this set of examples. To demonstrate this, we work out some previously unknown classifications\nof the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of other Lie algebras such as\nthe generalized Onsager algebra.\nIf M = M (X, g)\u0393 is an equivariant map algebra, \u03b1 \u2208 M, and x is a k-rational\npoint of X, the image \u03b1(x) is not an arbitrary element of g, but rather an element\nof gx = {u \u2208 g : g * u = u for all g \u2208 \u0393x } where \u0393x = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g * x = x}. For\na finite subset x of k-rational points of X and finite-dimensional representations\n\u03c1x : gx \u2192 Endk Vx , x \u2208 x, we define the associated evaluation representation as the\ncomposition\nev\n\nx\nM \u2212\u2192\n\nL\n\nx\u2208x g\n\nx \u2297x\u2208x \u03c1x\n\nN\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Endk ( x\u2208x Vx ),\n\nwhere evx : \u03b1 7\u2192 (\u03b1(x))x\u2208x is evaluation at x. Our definition is slightly more general than the classical definition of evaluation representations, which require the\nVx to be representations of g instead of gx . We believe our definition to be more\nnatural, and it leads to a simplification of the classification of irreducible finitedimensional representations in certain cases. For instance, the Onsager algebra is\nan equivariant map algebra where X = Spec k[t\u00b11 ], g = sl2 (k), and \u0393 = {1, \u03c3},\nwith \u03c3 acting on X by \u03c3 * x = x\u22121 and on g by the Chevalley involution. For\nthe fixed points x = \u00b11 \u2208 X, the subalgebras gx are one-dimensional, in fact Cartan subalgebras, while gx = g for x 6= \u00b11. In the classification of the irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations of the Onsager algebra given in [DR00], not all\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations since\nthe more restrictive definition is used. Instead, a discussion of type is needed to\nreduce all irreducible finite-dimensional representations (via an automorphism of\nthe enveloping algebra) to evaluation representations. However, under the more\ngeneral definition of evaluation representation given in the current paper, all irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the Onsager algebra are evaluation\nrepresentations and no discussion of type is needed. Additionally, contrary to what\nhas been imposed before (for example in the multiloop case), we allow the representations \u03c1x to be non-faithful. This will provide us with greater flexibility. Finally,\nwe note that we use the term evaluation representation even when we evaluate at\nmore than one point (i.e. when |x| > 1). Such representations are often called\ntensor products of evaluation representations in the literature, where evaluation\nrepresentations are at a single point.\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nBy the above, the main question becomes: When does an irreducible finitedimensional representation of M factor through an evaluation map evx ? Surprisingly, the answer is not always. In particular, the Lie algebra may have onedimensional representations that are not evaluation representations. Any onedimensional representation corresponds to a linear form \u03bb \u2208 M\u2217 vanishing on\n[M, M]. In some cases, all such linear forms are evaluation representations, but\nin other cases this is not true. Our main result (Theorem 5.5) is that any irreducible finite-dimensional representation of M is a tensor product of an evaluation\nrepresentation and a one-dimensional representation.\nObviously, if M = [M, M] is perfect, then our theorem implies that every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of M is an evaluation representation.\nFor example, this is so in the case of a multiloop algebra which is an equivari\u00b11\nant map algebra M = M (X, g)\u0393 for X = Spec k[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ], g simple, and\n\u0393 = Z/(m1 Z) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Z/(mn Z) with the i-th factor of \u0393 acting on the i-th coordinate of X by a primitive mi -th root of unity. Note that in this case \u0393 acts\nfreely on X and therefore all gx = g. But perfectness of M is by no means necessary for all irreducible finite-dimensional representations to be evaluation representations. In fact, in Section 5 we provide an easy criterion for this to be the\ncase, which in particular can be applied to the Onsager algebra to see that all\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations in the\nmore general sense. On the other hand, we also provide conditions under which not\nall irreducible finite-dimensional representations of an equivariant map algebra are\nevaluation representations (see Proposition 5.19).\nAn important feature of our classification is the fact that isomorphism classes\nof evaluation representations are parameterized in a natural and uniform fashion.\nSpecifically, for a rational point x \u2208 Xrat , let Rx be the set of isomorphism\nclasses\nF\nof irreducible finite-dimensional representations of gx and set RX = x\u2208Xrat Rx .\nThen there is a canonical \u0393-action on RX , and isomorphism classes of evaluation representations are naturally enumerated by finitely-supported \u0393-equivariant\nfunctions \u03a8 : Xrat \u2192 RX such that \u03a8(x) \u2208 Rx . Thus we see that evaluation\nrepresentations \"live on orbits\". This point of view gives a natural geometric explanation for the somewhat technical algebraic conditions that appear in previous\nclassifications (such as for the multiloop algebras).\nWe shortly describe the contents of the paper. After a review of some results in\nthe representation theory of Lie algebras in Section 1, we introduce map algebras\n(\u0393 = {1}) and equivariant map algebras (arbitrary \u0393) in Sections 2 and 3 and\ndiscuss old and new examples. We introduce the formalism of evaluation representations in Section 4 and classify the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of\nequivariant map algebras in Section 5. We show that in general not all irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations, and we derive a\nsufficient criterion for this to nevertheless be the case, as well as a necessary condition. Finally, in Section 6 we apply our general theorem to some specific cases\nof equivariant map algebras, recovering previous results as well as obtaining new\nones.\nNotation. Throughout this paper, k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic\nzero. For schemes, we use the terminology of [EH00]. In particular, an affine scheme\nX is the (prime) spectrum of a commutative associative k-algebra A. Note that\nwe do not assume that A is finitely generated in general. We say that X is an\n\n\f4\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\naffine variety if A is finitely generated and reduced, in which case we identify X\nwith the maximal spectrum of A. For an arbitrary scheme X, we set A = OX (X),\nexcept when the possibility of confusion exists (for instance, when more than one\nscheme is being considered), in which case we use the notation AX . We let Xrat\ndenote the set of k-rational points of X. Recall ([EH00, p. 45]) that x \u2208 X is a\nk-rational point of X if its residue field is k. The symbol g will always denote a\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebra (but see Remark 5.3). All tensor products will be\nover k, unless indicated otherwise. If a group \u0393 acts on a vector space V we denote\nby V \u0393 = {v \u2208 V : g * v = v for all g \u2208 \u0393} the subspace of fixed points.\n1. Review of some results on representations of Lie algebras\nFor easier reference we review some mostly known results about representations\nof Lie algebras. Let L be a Lie algebra, not necessarily of finite dimension. The\nfirst items concern representations of the Lie algebra\nL = L1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Ln ,\n\nwhere L1 , . . . , Ln are ideals of L. Recall that if Vi , i = 1, . . . , n, are Li -modules,\nthen V1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Vn is an L-module with action\nn\nX\n(v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vi\u22121 \u2297 ui * vi \u2297 vi+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vn ).\n(u1 , . . . , un ) * (v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 vn ) =\ni=1\n\nWe will always use this L-module structure on V = V1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Vn . It will sometimes\nbe useful to denote this representation by \u03c11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1n , where \u03c1i : Li \u2192 Endk (Vi )\nare the individual representations. We call an irreducible L-module V absolutely\nirreducible if EndL (V ) = k Id. By Schur's Lemma, an irreducible L-module of\ncountable dimension is absolutely irreducible.\nWe collect in the following proposition various well-known facts that we will need\nin the current paper.\nProposition 1.1.\n(1) Let Vi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, be non-zero Li -modules and let V = V1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Vn . Then\nV is completely reducible (respectively absolutely irreducible) if and only if\nall Vi are completely reducible (respectively absolutely irreducible). For a\nproof, see for example [Bou58, \u00a77.4, Theorem 2] and use the fact that the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of L is U(L) = U(L1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 U(Ln ), or see\n[Li04, Lemma 2.7].\n(2) Let n = 2; thus L = L1 \u2295L2 , and let V be an irreducible L-module. Suppose\nthat V , considered as an L1 -module, contains an absolutely irreducible L1 submodule V1 . Then there exists an irreducible L2 -module V2 such that\nV \u223c\n= V1 \u2297V2 . The isomorphism classes of V1 and V2 are uniquely determined\nby V . For a proof in the case dimk V < \u221e see, for example, [Bou58, \u00a77.7,\nProposition 8] and observe that irreducibility of V2 follows from (1). For a\nproof in general see [Li04, Lemma 2.7].\n(3) Suppose L2 , . . . , Ln are finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras (note\nthat there are no assumptions on L1 ) and let V be an irreducible finitedimensional L-module. Then there exist irreducible finite-dimensional Li modules Vi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that V \u223c\n= V1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Vn . The isomorphism\nclasses of the Li -modules Vi are uniquely determined by V . This follows\nfrom (2) by induction.\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\n(4) Let L be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over k. Then:\n(a) L has a finite-dimensional faithful completely reducible representation\nif and only if L is reductive ([Bou71, \u00a76.4, Proposition 5]).\n(b) L has a finite-dimensional faithful irreducible representation if and\nonly if L is reductive and its center is at most one-dimensional ([Bou71,\n\u00a76, Exercise 20]).\n(5) We denote by L\u2217 = Homk (L, k) the dual space of L and identify (L/[L, L])\u2217 =\n{\u03bb \u2208 L\u2217 : \u03bb([L, L]) = 0}. Any \u03bb \u2208 (L/[L, L])\u2217 is a one-dimensional, hence\nirreducible, representation of the Lie algebra L, and every one-dimensional\nrepresentation of L is of this form. Two linear forms \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 (L/[L, L])\u2217 are\nisomorphic as representations if and only if \u03bb = \u03bc. The proof of these facts\nis immediate.\nWe combine some of these facts in the following lemma.\nLemma 1.2. Let L be a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra and let \u03c1 :\nL \u2192 Endk (V ) be an irreducible finite-dimensional representation. Then there exist\nunique irreducible finite-dimensional representations \u03c1i : L \u2192 Endk (Vi ), i = 1, 2,\nsuch that \u03c1 = \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 and\n(1) \u03c11 = \u03bb for a unique \u03bb \u2208 (L/[L, L])\u2217 as in Proposition 1.1(5) (hence V = V2\nas k-vector spaces) and\n(2) L/ Ker \u03c12 is finite-dimensional semisimple.\nProof. The representation \u03c1 factors as\n\u03c1\n/ Endk (V )\nL \u25bc\u25bc\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\nq8\nq\n\u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\nqq\nq\nq\nq\n\u03c0 \u25bc\u25bc\u25bc\n\u25bc\u25bc& & + qqqqq \u03c1\nL\u0304\n\nwhere L\u0304 = L/ Ker \u03c1, \u03c0 is the canonical epimorphism and \u03c1\u0304 is a faithful representation of L\u0304, whence L\u0304 is finite-dimensional. By Proposition 1.1(4), L\u0304 is reductive.\nIf L\u0304 is semisimple, let \u03bb = 0 and \u03c1 = \u03c12 . Otherwise, by Proposition 1.1(4) again,\nL\u0304 has a one-dimensional center L\u0304z . Let L\u0304s = [L\u0304, L\u0304] be the semisimple part of L\u0304.\nSince [\u03c1\u0304(L\u0304z ), \u03c1\u0304(L\u0304s )] = 0, it follows that \u03c1\u0304|L\u0304s is irreducible. By Burnside's Theorem (see for example [Jac89, Chapter 4.3]) the associative subalgebra of Endk (V )\ngenerated by \u03c1\u0304(L\u0304s ) is therefore equal to Endk (V ). Consequently, \u03c1\u0304(L\u0304z ) \u2286 k IdV .\nBecause \u03c1\u0304 is faithful, we actually have \u03c1\u0304(L\u0304z ) = k IdV . We identify k IdV \u2261 k and\nthen define \u03c11 (x) = \u03c1\u0304(x\u0304z ), where x\u0304z is the L\u0304z -component of x\u0304 = \u03c0(x) \u2208 L\u0304. By\nProposition 1.1(5), \u03c11 = \u03bb for a unique 0 6= \u03bb \u2208 (L/[L, L])\u2217 . Finally, we define\n\u03c12 : L \u2192 Endk (V ) by \u03c12 (x) = \u03c1\u0304(x\u0304s ) where x\u0304s is the L\u0304s-component of x\u0304. Since \u03c1\u0304|L\u0304s\nis faithful, it follows that Ker \u03c12 = \u03c0 \u22121 (L\u0304z ), whence L/ Ker \u03c12 \u223c\n= L\u0304s is semisimple.\nThis proves existence of the decomposition. Uniqueness follows from the construction above.\n\u0003\n2. Map algebras\nIn this and the next section we define our main object of study \u2013 the Lie algebra\nof (equivariant) maps from a scheme to another Lie algebra \u2013 and discuss several\nexamples. We remind the reader that X is a scheme defined over k and g is\na finite-dimensional Lie algebra over k. Then g is naturally equipped with the\n\n\f6\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nstructure of an affine algebraic scheme, namely the affine n-space, where n = dim g.\nAddition and multiplication on g give rise to morphisms of schemes g \u00d7k g \u2192 g,\nand multiplication by a fixed scalar yields a morphism of schemes g \u2192 g.\nDefinition 2.1 (Map algebras). We denote by M (X, g) the Lie algebra of regular\nfunctions on X with values in g (equivalently, the set of morphisms of schemes\nX \u2192 g), called the untwisted map algebra or the Lie algebra of currents ([FL04]).\nThe multiplication in M (X, g) is defined pointwise. That is, for \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 M (X, g),\nwe define [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2208 M (X, g) to be the composition\n(\u03b1,\u03b2)\n\n[*,*]\n\nX \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 g \u00d7k g \u2212\u2212\u2192 g.\n\nThe addition and scalar multiplication are defined similarly.\nLemma 2.2. There is an isomorphism\nM (X, g) \u223c\n=g\u2297A\n\nof Lie algebras over A and hence also over k. The product on g \u2297 A is given by\n[u \u2297 f, v \u2297 g] = [u, v] \u2297 f g for u, v \u2208 g and f, g \u2208 A.\nBecause of Lemma 2.2, whose proof is routine, we will sometimes identify M (X, g)\nand g \u2297 A in what follows.\n\nRemark 2.3. If \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y is a morphism of schemes, then \u03c6\u2217 : M (Y, g) \u2192\nM (X, g) given by \u03c6\u2217 (\u03b1) = \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c6 is a Lie algebra homomorphism. For example, if\n\u03b9 : X \u0592\u2192 Y is an inclusion of schemes, then \u03b9\u2217 : M (Y, g) \u2192 M (X, g) is the restriction\n\u03c6\u2217 : \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03b1|X . The assignments X 7\u2192 M (X, g), \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 are easily seen to define a\ncontravariant functor from the category of schemes to the category of Lie algebras.\nAnalogously, for fixed X, the assignment g 7\u2192 M (X, g) is a covariant functor from\nthe category of finite-dimensional Lie algebras to the category of Lie algebras.\nExample 2.4 (Current algebras). Let X be the n-dimensional affine space. Then\nA \u223c\n= k[t1 , . . . , tn ] is a polynomial algebra in n variables and M (X, g) \u223c\n= g\u2297\nk[t1 , . . . , tn ] is the so-called current algebra.\n\nExample 2.5 (Untwisted multiloop algebras). Let X = Spec A, where A =\n\u00b11\n\u223c\nk[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ] is the k-algebra of Laurent polynomials in n variables. Then M (X, g) =\n\u00b11\n\u00b1n\ng \u2297 k[t1 , . . . , tn ] is an untwisted multiloop algebra. In the case n = 1, it is usually\ncalled the untwisted loop algebra of g.\n\u223c\nExample 2.6 (Tetrahedron Lie algebra). If X is the variety k \\ {0, 1}, then A =\nk[t, t\u22121 , (t \u2212 1)\u22121 ] and M (X, sl2 ) \u223c\n= sl2 \u2297 k[t, t\u22121 , (t \u2212 1)\u22121 ] is the three point sl2 loop\nalgebra. Removing any two distinct points of k results in an algebra isomorphic to\nM (X, sl2 ), and so there is no loss in generality in assuming the points are 0 and 1.\nIt was shown in [HT07] that M (X, sl2 ) is isomorphic to the tetrahedron Lie algebra\nand to a direct sum of three copies of the Onsager algebra (see Example 3.9). We\nrefer the reader to [HT07] and the references cited therein for further details.\n3. Equivariant map algebras\nRecall that we assume g is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. We denote the group\nof Lie algebra automorphisms of g by Autk g. Any Lie algebra automorphism of g,\nbeing a linear map, can also be viewed as an automorphism of g considered as a\nscheme. An action of a group \u0393 on g and on a scheme X will always be assumed\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nto be by Lie algebra automorphisms of g and scheme automorphisms of X. Recall\nthat there is an induced \u0393-action on A given by\ng * f = f g \u22121 ,\n\nf \u2208 A,\n\ng \u2208 \u0393,\n\nwhere on the right hand side we view g \u22121 as the corresponding automorphism of\nX.\nDefinition 3.1 (Equivariant map algebras). Let \u0393 be a group acting on a scheme X\nand a Lie algebra g by automorphisms. Then \u0393 acts on M (X, g) by automorphisms:\n(3.1)\n\ng * \u03b1 = g\u03b1g \u22121 ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g),\n\ng \u2208 \u0393,\n\nwhere on the right hand side g and g \u22121 are viewed as automorphisms of g and X,\nrespectively. We define M (X, g)\u0393 to be the set of fixed points under this action.\nThat is,\nM (X, g)\u0393 = {\u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g) : \u03b1g = g\u03b1 \u2200 g \u2208 \u0393}\nis the subalgebra of M (X, g) consisting of \u0393-equivariant maps from X to g. We call\nM (X, g)\u0393 an equivariant map algebra.\nExample 3.2 (Discrete spaces). Suppose X is a discrete (hence finite) variety.\nLet X \u2032 be a subset of X obtained by choosing one element from each \u0393-orbit of X.\nThen\nY\nM (X, g)\u0393 \u223c\ng\u0393x , \u03b1 7\u2192 (\u03b1(x))x\u2208X \u2032 , \u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g)\u0393 ,\n=\nx\u2208X \u2032\n\nis an isomorphism of Lie algebras, where \u0393x = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g * x = x} is the stabilizer\nsubgroup of x.\nLemma 3.3. Let \u0393 be a group acting on a scheme X and a Lie algebra g. Suppose\n\u03c41 \u2208 Autk g and \u03c42 \u2208 Aut X. Then we can define a second action of \u0393 on g and X\nby declaring g \u2208 \u0393 to act by \u03c41 g\u03c41\u22121 on g and by \u03c42 g\u03c42\u22121 on X. Let M and M\u2032 be\nthe equivariant map algebras with respect to these two actions. That is,\nM = {\u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g) : \u03b1g = g\u03b1 \u2200 g \u2208 \u0393},\n\nM\u2032 = {\u03b2 \u2208 M (X, g) : \u03b2\u03c42 g\u03c42\u22121 = \u03c41 g\u03c41\u22121 \u03b2 \u2200 g \u2208 \u0393}.\n\nThen M \u223c\n= M\u2032 as Lie algebras.\n\nProof. One easily checks that \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03c41 \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c42\u22121 intertwines the two \u0393-actions and\nthus yields the desired automorphism.\n\u0003\nThe group \u0393 acts naturally on g\u2297A by extending the map g*(u\u2297f ) = (g*u)\u2297(g*f )\nby linearity. Define\n(g \u2297 A)\u0393 := {\u03b1 \u2208 g \u2297 A : g * \u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2200 g \u2208 \u0393}\nto be the subalgebra of g \u2297 A consisting of elements fixed by \u0393. The proof of the\nfollowing lemma is immediate.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u0393 be a group acting on a scheme X and a Lie algebra g. Then\nthe isomorphism M (X, g) \u223c\n= g \u2297 A of Lemma 2.2 is \u0393-equivariant. In particular,\nunder this isomorphism (g \u2297 A)\u0393 corresponds to M (X, g)\u0393 .\n\n\f8\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nRemark 3.5. Let V = Spec A, an affine scheme but not necessarily an affine\nvariety. By assumption, \u0393 acts on X, hence on A. Thus \u0393 acts on V by [EH00,\nI-40]. Since AV = AX = A, we have M (X, g)\u0393 \u223c\n= M (V, g)\u0393 . Therefore,\n= (g \u2297 A)\u0393 \u223c\nwe lose no generality in assuming that X is an affine scheme, and we will often do\nso in the sequel.\nLemma 3.6. If \u0393 acts trivially on g, then M (X, g)\u0393 \u223c\n= M (Spec(A\u0393 ), g), and hence\n\u0393\nM (X, g) is isomorphic to an (untwisted) map algebra.\nProof. The proof is straightforward.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet \u0393 be a finite group. Recall that any \u0393-module B decomposes uniquely as a\ndirect sum B = B \u0393 \u2295 B\u0393 of the two \u0393-submodules B \u0393 and B\u0393 = Span{g * m \u2212 m :\ng \u2208 \u0393, m \u2208 B}. WeP\nlet \u266f : B \u2192 B \u0393 be the canonical \u0393-module epimorphism, given\n1\n\u266f\nby m 7\u2192 m = |\u0393| g\u2208\u0393 g * m. If B is a (possibly nonassociative) algebra and \u0393\nacts by automorphisms, then\n(3.2)\n\n[B \u0393 , B \u0393 ] \u2286 B \u0393 ,\n\n[B \u0393 , B\u0393 ] \u2286 B\u0393 ,\n\n[m0 , m\u266f ] = [m0 , m]\u266f ,\n\nfor m0 \u2208 B \u0393 and m \u2208 B. Since g\u2297A = (g\u0393 \u2297A\u0393 )\u2295(g\u0393 \u2297A\u0393 )\u2295(g\u0393 \u2297A\u0393 )\u2295(g\u0393 \u2297A\u0393 ),\nwe get\nM = (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 ) \u2295 (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u0393\nand\n\n[g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 , g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 ] \u2286 g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 ,\n\n[g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 , (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u0393 ] \u2286 (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u0393 .\n\nLemma 3.7. We suppose that \u0393 is a finite group and use the notation above. Then\nwe have:\n(1) If [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] = g\u0393 , then\n\u0001\n[g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] \u2297 A\u0393 \u2286 [M, M] = [M, M] \u2229 (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 ) \u2295 (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u0393 .\n\nIn particular, if [g\u0393 , g] = g, then M is perfect.\n(2) If g is simple, g\u0393 6= {0} is perfect and the representation of g\u0393 on g\u0393 does\nnot have a trivial non-zero subrepresentation, then g = [g\u0393 , g], and hence\nM is perfect.\n\nProof.\n(1) The inclusion [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] \u2297 A\u0393 \u2286 [M, M] is obvious since g\u0393 \u2297 1 \u2286 M. For\nu0 \u2208 g\u0393 and v \u2208 g\u0393 we have, using (3.2), ([u0 , v] \u2297 f )\u266f = [u0 \u2297 1, (v \u2297 f )\u266f ] \u2208\n[M, M], whence (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u0393 = (g\u0393 \u2297 A\u0393 )\u266f \u2286 [M, M] by linearity of \u266f. The\nsame argument also shows that [g\u0393 , g] = g implies that M is perfect.\n(2) Since g\u0393 is reductive by [Bou75, VII, \u00a71.5, Proposition 14] and perfect\nby assumption, g\u0393 is semisimple. Thus the representation of g\u0393 on g\u0393 is\na direct sum of irreducible representations. If U \u2286 g\u0393 is an irreducible\ng\u0393 -submodule then [g\u0393 , U ] \u2286 U is a submodule, which is non-zero by assumption on (ad g\u0393 )|g\u0393 . Hence [g\u0393 , U ] = U and thus [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] = g\u0393 . Then\ng = [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] \u2295 [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] = [g\u0393 , g] follows, so that we can apply (1).\n\u0003\nExample 3.8 (\u0393 abelian). Since the groups in several of the examples discussed\nlater will be abelian, it is convenient to discuss the case of an arbitrary abelian\ngroup. We assume that the action of \u0393 on g and on A is diagonalizable \u2013 a condition\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nwhich is always fulfilled if \u0393 is finite. Hence, denoting by \u039e = \u039e(\u0393) the character\ngroup of \u0393, the action of \u0393 on g induces a \u039e-grading of g, i.e.,\nL\ng = \u03be\u2208\u039e g\u03be , [g\u03be , g\u03b6 ] \u2286 g\u03be+\u03b6 ,\n\nwhere\ng\u03be = {u \u2208 g : g * u = \u03be(g)u for all g \u2208 \u0393} and \u03be, \u03b6 \u2208 \u039e. Thus g0 = g\u0393 and\nL\n06=\u03be g\u03be = g\u0393 in the notation above. We have a similar decomposition for A. The\nfixed point subalgebra of the diagonal action of \u0393 on g \u2297 A is therefore\nL\n(g \u2297 A)\u0393 = \u03be\u2208\u039e g\u03be \u2297 A\u2212\u03be ,\nwhere \u2212\u03be corresponds to the representation dual to \u03be. The assumption [g\u0393 , g\u0393 ] = g\u0393\nmeans [g0 , g\u03be ] = g\u03be for all 0 6= \u03be, and if this is fulfilled we have\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nM\n[M, M] = \uf8ed [g\u03be , g\u2212\u03be ] \u2297 A\u03be A\u2212\u03be \uf8f8 \u2295\ng\u03be \u2297 A\u2212\u03be\n\u03be\n\n06=\u03be\n\nAs a special case, let \u0393 = {1, \u03c3} be a group of order 2. Then g = g0 \u2295 g1 is\na Z2 -grading where gs = {u \u2208 g : \u03c3 * u = (\u22121)s u} for s = 0, 1 \u2208 Z2 . Thus\nM = (g \u2297 A)\u0393 = (g0 \u2297 A0 ) \u2295 (g1 \u2297 A1 ), where A = A0 \u2295 A1 is the Z2 -grading of\nA induced by \u03c3. Hence\n[M, M] = ([g0 , g0 ] \u2297 A0 + [g1 , g1 ] \u2297 A21 ) \u2295 ([g0 , g1 ] \u2297 A1 ).\nIn particular, if g is simple and \u03c3 6= Id, then\ng = [g, g] = ([g0 , g0 ] + [g1 , g1 ]) \u2295 ([g0 , g1 ]).\nThis implies [g0 , g1 ] = g1 . Also, since g1 + [g1 , g1 ] is the ideal generated by g1 ,\nwhich must be all of g, we have [g1 , g1 ] = g0 . Thus\n(3.3)\n\n[M, M] = ([g0 , g0 ] \u2297 A0 + g0 \u2297 A21 ) \u2295 (g1 \u2297 A1 ) (|\u0393| = 2, g simple).\n\nTherefore, in this case M is perfect as soon as g0 is perfect, i.e., semisimple, or\nA0 = A21 , i.e., A = A0 \u2295 A1 is a strong Z2 -grading.\nExample 3.9 (Generalized Onsager algebra). Let X = k \u00d7 = Spec k[t, t\u22121 ], g be\na simple Lie algebra, and \u0393 = {1, \u03c3} be a group of order 2. We choose a set of\nChevalley generators {ei , fi , hi } for g and let \u0393 act on g by the standard Chevalley\ninvolution, i.e.,\n\u22121\n\n\u03c3(ei ) = \u2212fi , \u03c3(fi ) = \u2212ei , \u03c3(hi ) = \u2212hi .\n\nLet \u0393 act on k[t, t ] by \u03c3 * t = t\u22121 , inducing an action of \u0393 on X. We define the\ngeneralized Onsager algebra O(g) to be the equivariant map algebra associated to\nthese data:\n\u223c (g \u2297 k[t, t\u22121 ])\u0393 .\nO(g) := M (k \u00d7 , g)\u0393 =\nThese algebras have been considered by G. Benkart and M. Lau. The action of \u03c3\non g interchanges the positive and negative root spaces, and thus the dimension of\nthe fixed point subalgebra g\u0393 is equal to the number of positive roots. This fact,\ntogether with the classification of automorphisms of order two (see, for example,\n[Hel01, Chapter X, \u00a75, Tables II and III]) determines g0 = g\u0393 as follows:\n\n\f10\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nType of g (Type of) g0\nAn\nson+1\nBn (n \u2265 2) son \u2295 son+1\nCn (n \u2265 2) gln = k \u2295 sln\nDn (n \u2265 4)\nson \u2295 son\nE6\nC4\nE7\nA7\nE8\nD8\nF4\nC3 \u2295 A1\nG2\nA1 \u2295 A1\nSince so2 is one-dimensional, we see that g\u0393 is semisimple in all cases, except g = sl2\n(type A1 ), g = so5 (type B2 ) and g = spn (type Cn ).

One can consider the following situation, which is even more\ngeneral than Example 3.9. Namely, we consider the same setup except that we\nallow \u03c3 to act by an arbitrary involution of g. Again, by the classification of\nautomorphisms of order two, it is known that g0 is either semisimple or has a\none-dimensional center. Thus we have\n(\nif g0 is semisimple, and\n\u223c 0\n(3.6)\nM/[M, M] =\nA0 /A21 otherwise.\nRemark 3.11. For k = C it was shown in [Roa91] that O(sl2 ) is isomorphic to\nthe usual Onsager algebra. This algebra was a key ingredient in Onsager's original\nsolution of the 2D Ising model. The algebra O(sln ), k = C, was introduced in\n[UI96], although the definition given there differs slightly from the one given in\nExample 3.9. For g = sln , the Chevalley involution of Example 3.9 is given by\n\u03c3 * u = \u2212ut , while the involution used in [UI96] is given by Eij 7\u2192 (\u22121)i+j+1 Eji ,\nwhere Eij is the standard elementary matrix with the (i, j) entry equal to one\n\u22121\nand all other entries equal to\u221azero. This\n\u221a involution is equal to \u03c41 \u03c3\u03c41 , where\n\u22121\n\u03c41 (u) = DuD for D = diag( \u22121, +1, \u22121, . . . ). Furthermore, the involution of\nn \u22121\nX considered in [UI96] is\n\u221a x 7\u2192 (\u22121) x , which is equal to \u03c3 if n is even and to\n\u22121\n\u03c42 \u03c3\u03c42 , where \u03c42 * x = \u22121x, if n is odd. Therefore it follows from Lemma 3.3\nthat the two versions are isomorphic.\nExample 3.12 (Multiloop algebras). Fix positive integers n, m1 , . . . , mn . Let\n\u0393 = hg1 , . . . , gn : gimi = 1, gi gj = gj gi , \u2200 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 ni.\nThen \u039e = \u039e(\u0393) \u223c\n= Z/m1 Z \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Z/mn Z \u223c\n= \u0393. Suppose \u0393 acts on a semisimple\ng. Note that this is equivalent to specifying commuting automorphisms \u03c3i , i =\n1, . . . , n, of g such that \u03c3imi = id. For i = 1, . . . , n, let \u03bei be a primitive mi -th\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\nroot of unity. As in Example 3.8 we then see that g has a \u039e-grading for which the\nhomogenous subspace of degree k\u0304, k = (k1 , . . . , kn ) \u2208 Zn , is given by\ngk\u0304 = {u \u2208 g : \u03c3i (u) = \u03beiki u \u2200 i = 1, . . . , n}.\n\nLet X = (k \u00d7 )n and define an action of \u0393 on X by\n\ngi * (z1 , . . . , zn ) = (z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , \u03bei zi , zi+1 , . . . , zn ).\nThen\n(3.7)\n\nM (g, \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n , m1 , . . . , mn ) := M (X, g)\u0393\n\nis the multiloop algebra of g relative to (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n ) and (m1 , . . . , mn ). If all \u03c3i = Id\nwe recover the untwisted multiloop algebra of Example 2.5. If not all \u03c3i = Id, the\nalgebra M is therefore sometimes called the twisted loop algebra.\n\u00b11\nWith \u0393 and X as above, the induced action of \u0393 on A = k[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ] is given\nby\n\u03c3i * f (t1 , . . . , tn ) = f (t1 , . . . , ti\u22121 , \u03bei\u22121 ti , ti+1 , . . . , tn ),\n\n\u00b11\nf \u2208 k[t\u00b11\n1 , . . . , tn ].\n\nHence\n(3.8)\n\nM (g, \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n , m1 , . . . , mn ) \u223c\n=\n= (g \u2297 k[t1\u00b11 , . . . , tn\u00b11 ])\u0393 \u223c\n\nM\n\nk\u2208Zn\n\ngk\u0304 \u2297 ktk ,\n\nwhere tk = tk11 * * * tknn .\nLoop and multiloop algebras play an important role in the theory of affine KacMoody algebras [Kac90], extended affine Lie algebras, and Lie tori. The connection\nbetween the last two classes of Lie algebras is the following: The core and the\ncenterless core of an extended affine Lie algebra is a Lie torus or centerless Lie torus\nrespectively, every Lie torus arises in this way, and there is a precise construction of\nextended affine Lie algebras in terms of centerless Lie tori [Neh04]. Any centerless\nLie torus whose grading root system is not of type A can be realized as a multiloop\nalgebra [ABFP09].\nWhile most classification results involving (special cases of) equivariant map algebras in the literature use abelian groups, we will see that the general classification\ndeveloped in the current paper only assumes that the group \u0393 is finite. Therefore,\nfor illustrative purposes, we include here an example of an equivariant map algebra\nwhere the group \u0393 is not abelian. We will see in Section 6.4 that the representation\ntheory of this algebra is quite interesting.\nExample 3.13 (A non-abelian example). Let \u0393 = S3 , the symmetric group on\n3 objects, X = P1 \\ {0, 1, \u221e} and g = so8 , the simple Lie algebra of type D4 .\nThe symmetry group of the Dynkin diagram of type D4 is isomorphic to S3 , and\nso \u0393 acts naturally on g by diagram automorphisms (see Remark 4.12). Now,\ngiven points xi , yi , i = 1, 2, 3, of P1 , there is a unique M\u00f6bius transformation\nof P1 mapping xi to yi , i = 1, 2, 3. Thus, for any permutation \u03c3 of the points\n{0, 1, \u221e}, there is a unique M\u00f6bius transformation of P1 which induces \u03c3 on the set\n{0, 1, \u221e}. Hence each permutation \u03c3 naturally corresponds to an automorphism of\nX, which we also denote by \u03c3. Therefore we can form the equivariant map algebra\nM = M (X, g)\u0393 . Now, the subalgebra of g fixed by the unique order three subgroup\nof \u0393 is the simple Lie algebra of type G2 (see [Kac90, Proposition 8.3]). One easily\nchecks that this subalgebra is fixed by all of \u0393. Therefore g\u0393 is perfect. By [Kac90,\n\n\f12\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nProposition 8.3], the representation of g\u0393 on g\u0393 is a direct sum of two 7-dimensional\nirreducible representations. Thus, by Lemma 3.7, M is perfect.\n4. Evaluation representations\nFrom now on we assume that \u0393 is a finite group, acting on an affine scheme X\nand a (finite-dimensional) Lie algebra g by automorphisms. We abbreviate M =\nM (X, g)\u0393 .\nDefinition 4.1 (Restriction). Let Y be a subscheme of X. Then, as in Remark 2.3,\nwe have the restriction Lie algebra homomorphism\n\u0393\nResX\nY : M (X, g) \u2192 M (Y, g),\n\nResX\nY (\u03b1) = \u03b1|Y ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g)\u0393 .\n\n\u0393\nIf Y is a \u0393-invariant subscheme, the image of ResX\nY is contained in M (Y, g) .\n\nDefinition 4.2 (Evaluation). Given a finite subset x \u2286 Xrat , we define the corresponding evaluation map\nL\nevx : M (X, g)\u0393 \u2192 x\u2208x g, \u03b1 7\u2192 (\u03b1(x))x\u2208x , \u03b1 \u2208 M (X, g)\u0393 .\nDefinition 4.3. For a subset Z of X we define\n\n\u0393Z = {g \u2208 \u0393 : g * z = z \u2200 z \u2208 Z} and gZ = g\u0393Z .\n\nObviously, \u0393Z is a subgroup of \u0393 and gZ is a subalgebra of g. In particular, for any\nx \u2208 X, we put \u0393x = \u0393{x} and gx = g{x} .\nLemma 4.4.\n(1) Let Z be a subset of Xrat . Then \u03b1(Z) \u2286 gZ for all \u03b1 \u2208 M(X, g)\u0393 . In\nparticular, \u03b1(x) \u2208 gx for all x \u2208 Xrat .\n(2) Let Z be a \u0393-invariant subscheme of X for which the restriction AX \u2192 AZ ,\n\u0393\nf 7\u2192 f |Z , is surjective. Then the restriction map ResX\nZ : M (X, g) \u2192\n\u0393\nM (Z, g) is also surjective.\nProof. Part (1) is immediate from the definitions. In (2), finite-dimensionality\nof g implies that the restriction M (X, g) \u2192 M (Z, g) is surjective. Since \u0393 acts\ncompletely reducibly on M (X, g) and M (Z, g), the restriction is then also surjective\non the subalgebras of \u0393-invariants.\n\u0003\nDefinition 4.5. We denote by Xn the set of n-element subsets x \u2286 Xrat consisting\nof k-rational points and having the property that y 6\u2208 \u0393 * x for distinct x, y \u2208 x.\nL\nCorollary 4.6. For x \u2208 Xn the image of evx is x\u2208x gx .\nS\nProof. Let Z = x\u2208x \u0393 * x. Then Z is a \u0393-invariant closed subvariety. Hence AX \u2192\n\u0393\nM (Z, g)\u0393 is also surjective by\nAZ is surjective, and therefore ResX\nZ : M (X, g) \u2192 L\n\u0003\nLemma 4.4. It is immediate that evx : M (Z, g)\u0393 \u2192 x\u2208x gx is surjective.\nDefinition 4.7 (Evaluation representation). Fix a finite subset x \u2286 Xrat and let\n\u03c1x : gx \u2192 Endk Vx , x \u2208 x, be representations of gx on the vector spaces Vx .

We note some important distinctions between Definition 4.7 and\nother uses of the term evaluation representation in the literature. First of all, some\nauthors reserve the term evaluation representation for the case n = 1 and would\nrefer to the more general case as a tensor product of evaluation representations.\nFurthermore, traditionally the \u03c1x are representations of g instead of gx and are\nrequired to be faithful. In the case that gx = g for all x \u2208 X (for instance, if \u0393 acts\nfreely on X), this of course makes no difference. However, we will see in the sequel\nthat the more general definition of evaluation representation given above allows for\na more uniform classification of irreducible finite-dimensional representations.\nProposition 4.9. Let x \u2208 Xn , and for x \u2208 x let \u03c1x : gx \u2192 Endk Vx be an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of gx . Then the evaluation representation\nevx (\u03c1x )x\u2208x is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of M (X, g)\u0393 .\nProof. Since evx is surjective, this follows from Proposition 1.1(1).\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.10. If x is in X n (but not necessarily in Xn ), gx is semisimple for\nall x \u2208 x, and \u03c1x is an arbitrary finite-dimensional representation of gx for each\nx \u2208 x, then the evaluation representation evx (\u03c1x )x\u2208x is completely reducible.\nProof. This follows from Proposition 4.9 and complete reducibility of finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of each gx .\n\u0003\nBy abuse of notation, we will sometimes denote a representation of g by the\nunderlying vector space V . Then evx V , x \u2208 X, will denote the corresponding evaluation representation of M (X, g)\u0393 . Note that, with the notation of Definition 4.7,\nwe have\nO\n(4.1)\nevx (\u03c1x )x\u2208x \u223c\nevx Vx .\n=\nx\u2208x\n\nNote that Xrat is \u0393-invariant and that Xrat = X if X is an affine variety. Let\nx \u2208 Xrat and g \u2208 \u0393. Since \u0393g*x = g\u0393x g \u22121 we see that gg*x = g * gx . Hence if \u03c1 is a\nrepresentation of gx , then \u03c1 \u25e6 g \u22121 is a representation of gg*x . Let Rx denote the set\nx\nof isomorphism\nF classes of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of g , and\nput RX = x\u2208Xrat Rx . Then \u0393 acts on RX by\n\u0393 \u00d7 RX \u2192 RX ,\n\n(g, [\u03c1]) 7\u2192 g * [\u03c1] := [\u03c1 \u25e6 g \u22121 ] \u2208 Rg*x ,\n\nwhere [\u03c1] \u2208 Rx denotes the isomorphism class of a representation \u03c1 of gx .\nDefinition 4.11. Let E denote the set of finitely supported \u0393-equivariant functions\n\u03a8 : Xrat \u2192 RX such that \u03a8(x) \u2208 Rx . Here the support supp \u03a8 of \u03a8 \u2208 E is the set\nof all x \u2208 Xrat for which \u03a8(x) 6= 0, where 0 denotes the isomorphism class of the\ntrivial representation.\nFor isomorphic representations \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 of gx , the evaluation representations\nevx \u03c1 and evx \u03c1\u2032 are isomorphic. Therefore, for [\u03c1] \u2208 Rx , we can define evx [\u03c1] to\nbe the isomorphism class of evx \u03c1, and this is independent of the representative \u03c1.\nSimilarly, for a finite subset x \u2286 Xrat and representations \u03c1x of gx for x \u2208 x, we\ndefine evx ([\u03c1x ])x\u2208x to be the isomorphism class of evx (\u03c1x )x\u2208x .\nRemark 4.12. Suppose g is a semisimple Lie algebra. In the case that \u0393 is cyclic\nand acts on g by admissible diagram automorphisms (no edge joins two vertices in\nthe same orbit), there exists a simple description of E which can be seen as follows.\n\n\f14\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nLet I be the set of vertices of the Dynkin diagram of g. An action of \u0393 on this\nDynkin diagram gives rise to an action of \u0393 on g via\ng * hi = hg*i ,\n\ng * ei = eg*i ,\n\ng * fi = fg*i ,\n\ng \u2208 \u0393,\n\nwhere {hi , ei , fi }i\u2208I is a set of Chevalley generators of g. We then have a natural\naction of \u0393 on the weight lattice P of g given by\ng * \u03c9i = \u03c9g*i ,\n\ng \u2208 \u0393,\n\nwhere {\u03c9i }i\u2208I is the set of fundamental weights of g. Now, isomorphism classes\nof irreducible finite-dimensional representations of g are naturally enumerated by\nthe set of dominant weights P + by associating to \u03bb \u2208 P + the isomorphism class\nof the irreducible highest weight representation of highest weight \u03bb. Let \u1ebc denote\nthe set of \u0393-equivariant functions Xrat \u2192 P + with finite support. It follows that\nfor \u03a8 \u2208 \u1ebc and x \u2208 Xrat we have \u03a8(x) \u2208 (P + )\u0393x , where (P + )\u0393x denotes the set of\n\u0393x -invariant elements of P + . There is a canonical bijection between (P + )\u0393x and\nthe positive weight lattice of gx (see [Lus93, Proposition 14.1.2]), and so we can\nassociate to \u03a8(x) the isomorphism class of the corresponding representation of gx .\nThus, we have a natural bijection between \u1ebc and E. Therefore, in the case that\n\u0393 acts on g by admissible diagram automorphisms, the evaluation representations\nare naturally enumerated by \u0393-equivariant maps from Xrat to the positive weight\nlattice P + of g. In the case that \u0393 acts freely on X, we can drop the assumption\nthat the diagram automorphisms be admissible.\nLemma 4.13. Suppose \u03a8 \u2208 E and x \u2208 supp \u03a8. Then for all g \u2208 \u0393,\nevx \u03a8(x) = evg*x (g * \u03a8(x)) = evg*x \u03a8(g * x).\nProof. For any g \u2208 \u0393 and representation \u03c1 of gx , the following diagram commutes:\nx\n\n: g \u274d\u274d\ntt\n\u274d\u274d \u03c1\nt\nevx tt\n\u274d\u274d\ntt\n\u274d\u274d\nt\n\u274d#\ntt\n\u0393\ng\nEnd\nM (X, g)\n; kV\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2708\u2708\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2708\n\u2708\n\u274f\u274f\n\u2708\u2708\nevg*x \u274f\u274f\n\u274f$ \u000f \u2708\u2708\u2708 \u03c1\u25e6g\u22121\ngg*x\nThus, evx \u03c1 = evg*x (\u03c1 \u25e6 g \u22121 ) and the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 4.14. For \u03a8 \u2208 E, we define ev\u03a8 = evx (\u03a8(x))x\u2208x , where x \u2208 Xn\ncontains one element of each \u0393-orbit in supp \u03a8. By Lemma 4.13, ev\u03a8 is independent\nof the choice of x. If \u03a8 is the map that is identically 0 on X, we define ev\u03a8 to be\nthe isomorphism class of the trivial representation of M. Thus \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 defines a\nmap E \u2192 S, where S denotes the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible finitedimensional representations of M.\nProposition 4.15. The map E \u2192 S, \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 , is injective.\nProof. Suppose \u03a8 6= \u03a8\u2032 \u2208 E. Then there exists x \u2208 Xrat such that \u03a8(x) 6= \u03a8\u2032 (x).\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume \u03a8(x) 6= 0. Let\nm = (dim ev\u03a8 )/(dim \u03a8(x)),\n\nm\u2032 = (dim ev\u03a8\u2032 )/(dim \u03a8\u2032 (x)),\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\nwhere the dimension of an isomorphism class of representations is simply the dimension of any representative of that class and m\u2032 = dim ev\u03a8\u2032 if \u03a8\u2032 (x) = 0. By\n(4.1), m and m\u2032 are positive integers. By Corollary 4.6, there exists a subalgebra a\nof M such that evx (a) = gx and evx\u2032 (a) = 0 for all x\u2032 \u2208 (supp \u03a8 \u222a supp \u03a8\u2032 ) \\ {\u0393 * x}.\nThen\nev\u03a8 |a = \u03a8(x)\u2295m ,\n\n\u2032\n\nev\u03a8\u2032 |a = \u03a8\u2032 (x)\u2295m .\n\nSince \u03a8(x) 6= \u03a8\u2032 (x), we have ev\u03a8 6= ev\u03a8\u2032 . In the above, we have used the convention that the restriction of an isomorphism class is the isomorphism class of the\nrestriction of any representative and that a direct sum of isomorphism classes is the\nisomorphism class of the corresponding direct sum of representatives.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.16. Let K be an ideal of M. If M/K does not contain non-zero solvable\nideals, e.g. if M/K is finite-dimensional semisimple, then K is an A\u0393 -submodule of\nM.\nProof. Let f \u2208 A\u0393 .

It suffices to show that for i = 1, . . . , s, f \u2208 A\u0393 and \u03b1 \u2208 M we have \u03c0i (f \u03b1) =\nf (xi )\u03c0i (\u03b1) for some xi \u2208 X. Since Ni is simple, the action of M on Ni induced by\nthe adjoint action is irreducible. By Lemma 4.16, Ni is an A\u0393 -module and \u03c0i is an\nA\u0393 -module homomorphism. Since the action of A\u0393 commutes with the action of\nM, we have that A\u0393 must act by scalars and thus as a character \u03c7 : A\u0393 \u2192 k. This\ncharacter corresponds to evaluation at a point x\u0303i \u2208 X//\u0393 := Spec A\u0393 . Choosing\nany xi in the preimage of x\u0303i under the canonical projection X \u2192 X//\u0393, the result\nfollows.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.18. If s = 1, then in the graded setting these types of maps have been\nstudied extensively in [ABFP08]. There \u03c1 is a character of the full centroid of M,\nwhile in the above A\u0393 is a priori only a subalgebra of the centroid of M.\nProposition 4.19. If supp \u03a8 \u2286 {x \u2208 X : gx = g}, then any evaluation representation in the isomorphism class ev\u03a8 of M (X, g)\u0393 is obtained by restriction from\nan evaluation representation of the untwisted map algebra M (X, g). In particular,\nthe restriction map from the set of isomorphism classes of evaluation representations of M (X, g) to the set of isomorphism classes of evaluation representations of\nM (X, g)\u0393 is surjective if gx = g for all x \u2208 X.\nProof. The proof is immediate.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\n5. Classification of irreducible finite-dimensional representations\nWe consider a finite group \u0393, acting on a finite-dimensional Lie algebra g and\nan affine scheme X. We put M = M (X, g)\u0393 .\nLemma 5.1. ([Bou70, II, Corollaire 2 de la Proposition 6, \u00a73.6]) Let S be a subring\nof a ring R and I an ideal of S. Then R \u2297S (S/I) \u223c\n= R/(RI).\nNote that A\u0393 is the coordinate ring of the quotient X//\u0393. For a point [x] \u2208 X//\u0393,\nlet m[x] denote the corresponding maximal ideal of A\u0393 and define A[x] = A \u2297A\u0393\n(A\u0393 /m[x] ). We will sometimes view [x] as an orbit in X.\nProposition 5.2. Suppose K is an ideal of M such that the quotient algebra M/K\nis finite-dimensional and simple. Then there exists a point x \u2208 Xrat such that\nthe canonical epimorphism \u03c0 : M \u2192 M/K factors through the evaluation map\nevx : M \u2192 gx .\nProof. We have shown in Proposition 4.17 that there exists a character \u03c7 : A\u0393 \u2192 k\nsuch that \u03c0(\u03b1f ) = \u03c0(\u03b1)\u03c7(f ) holds for all \u03b1 \u2208 M and f \u2208 A\u0393 . Let n = Ker \u03c7 \u2208\nSpec(A\u0393 ) be the corresponding k-rational point. Temporarily viewing M as a A\u0393 module, it follows that n annihilates M/K, whence nM \u2286 K, and we can factor \u03c0\nthrough obvious maps:\n\u03c0\n/ / M/K\nM\n\u2708: :\n\u2708\u2708\n\u2708\n\u2708\n\u2708\u2708\n\u000f\u000f \u2708\u2708\nM/nM\nObserve\n\u0001\u0393\n(5.1) M/nM \u223c\n= M \u2297A\u0393 (A\u0393 /n) = (g \u2297k A)\u0393 \u2297A\u0393 (A\u0393 /n) = g \u2297k A \u2297A\u0393 (A\u0393 /n) ,\n\nwhere in the last equality we used that \u0393 acts trivially on A\u0393 /n. Also note, by\nLemma 5.1,\n\u223c A/I for I = An.\n(5.2)\nA \u2297A\u0393 (A\u0393 /n) =\n\nHence, putting these canonical isomorphisms together, we get a new factorization:\n\u03c0\n\nM\n\n/ / M/K\nOO\n\u03c8\n\n\u000f\u000f\nM/nM\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u0001\n/ (g \u2297k A/I) \u0393\n\nIt now remains to show that \u03c8 factors through evx for an appropriate x \u2208 X.\nTo this end, let [n] = {m \u2208 Spec A : m \u2229 A\u0393 = n}. One knows ([Bou85, V, \u00a72])\nthat [n] is a non-empty set of k-rational points on which \u0393 acts transitively. Let\n[n] = {m1 , . . . , ms }. We claim\n\u221a\nI = m1 \u2229 * * * \u2229 ms .\n(5.3)\nIndeed, any p \u2208 V (I) \u2286 Spec A satisfies p \u2229 A\u0393 = n so that V (I) = [n]. Now (5.3)\nfollows from [Bou61, II, \u00a72.6, Corollaire de la Proposition 13].\nWe have an exact sequence of algebras and \u0393-modules\n\u0001\nT\nT\n(5.4)\n0 \u2192 g \u2297k ( i mi )/I \u2192 g \u2297k (A/I) \u2192 g \u2297k (A/ i mi ) \u2192 0,\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nwhere\ng \u2297k (A/\n\nT\n\nmi ) \u223c\n=\n\nL\n\ni g \u2297k (A/mi ))\nL\nsince A/ i mi \u223c\n=\ni A/mi . Now observe that the summands on the right hand\nside of (5.5) are permuted by the action of \u0393. Thus, if we fix x = m \u2208 [n] we have\n\u0001\u0393\nT\ng \u2297k (A/ i mi ) \u223c\n= (g \u2297k (A/m))\u0393x = gx .\n\n(5.5)\n\nT\n\ni\n\nTherefore, taking \u0393-invariants in (5.4) we get an epimorphism\n\u0001\u0393\n\u03b6 : g \u2297k (A/I) \u0589 gx\n\u0001\u0393\nT\nwith kernel g \u2297k ( i mi )/I .\nT\nP\n \u0304\n \u0304\nAny \u03b1 \u2208 Ker \u03b6 is a finite sum \u03b1 =\nj uj \u2297 fj , where every fj \u2208 ( i mi )/I\n\u0001\u0393\nis nilpotent by (5.3). The ideal J of g \u2297k (A/I) generated by \u03b1 is therefore\nnilpotent. Since M/K is simple, it does not contain a non-zero nilpotent ideal. Thus\n\u03c8(J) = 0.

Proposition 5.2 remains true for k an arbitrary algebraically closed\nfield whose characteristic does not divide the order of \u0393 and for g an arbitrary\nfinite-dimensional (not necessarily Lie or associative) algebra.\nCorollary 5.4.\n(1) Suppose \u03c6 : M \u2192 Endk V is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation such that M/ ker \u03c6 is a semisimple Lie algebra. Then \u03c6 is an irreducible finite-dimensional evaluation representation.\n(2) The irreducible finite-dimensional representations of M are precisely the\nrepresentations of the form \u03bb \u2297 \u03c6 where \u03bb \u2208 (M/[M, M])\u2217 and \u03c6 is an irreducible finite-dimensional evaluation representation with M/ Ker \u03c6 semisimple. The factors \u03bb and \u03c6 are uniquely determined.\nProof. Part (1) follows from Proposition 5.2 and the results of Section 1. Part (2)\nis then a simple application of Lemma 1.2.\n\u0003\nWe now state our main theorem which gives a classification of the irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations of an arbitrary equivariant map algebra. Recall\nthe definitions of E (Definition 4.11) and S (Definition 4.14).\nTheorem 5.5. Suppose \u0393 is a finite group acting on an affine scheme X and a\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebra g. Then the map\n(M/[M, M])\u2217 \u00d7 E \u2192 S,\n\n(\u03bb, \u03a8) 7\u2192 \u03bb \u2297 ev\u03a8 ,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 (M/[M, M])\u2217 ,\n\n\u03a8 \u2208 E,\n\nis surjective. In particular, all irreducible finite-dimensional representations of M\nare tensor products of an evaluation representation and a one-dimensional representation.\n\n\f18\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nFurthermore, we have that \u03bb \u2297 ev\u03a8 = \u03bb\u2032 \u2297 ev\u03a8\u2032 if and only if there exists \u03a6 \u2208 E\nsuch that dim ev\u03a6 = 1, \u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb \u2212 ev\u03a6 and ev\u03a8\u2032 = ev\u03a8\u2297\u03a6 . Here \u03a8 \u2297 \u03a6 \u2208 E is given by\n(\u03a8 \u2297 \u03a6)(x) = \u03a8(x) \u2297 \u03a6(x), where \u03a8(x) (respectively \u03a6(x)) is the one-dimensional\ntrivial representation if x 6\u2208 supp \u03a8 (respectively x 6\u2208 supp \u03a6). In particular, the\nrestriction of the map (\u03bb, \u03a8) 7\u2192 \u03bb \u2297 ev\u03a8 to either factor (times the zero element of\nthe other) is injective.\nProof. This follows from Corollary 5.4 and Lemma 1.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.6. Since \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 (M/[M, M])\u2217 are isomorphic as representations if and\nonly if they are equal as linear functions, in Theorem 5.5 we have identified elements\nof (M/[M, M])\u2217 with isomorphism classes of representations.\nRemark 5.7. Note that the evaluation representations of M (Spec A, g)\u0393 are the\nsame as the evaluation representations of M (Spec(A/ rad A), g)\u0393 since one evaluates\nat rational points. However, the one-dimensional representations of these two Lie\nalgebras can be different in general. Thus, we do not assume that the scheme X is\nreduced.\nCorollary 5.8. If M is perfect, then the map \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 is a bijection between E\nand S. In particular, this is true if any one of the following conditions holds:\n(1) [g\u0393 , g] = g,\n(2) g is simple, g\u0393 6= {0} is perfect and acts on g\u0393 without a trivial non-zero\nsubmodule, or\n(3) \u0393 acts on g by diagram automorphisms.\nProof. If M is perfect, then [M, M] = M, and the first statement follows immediately from Theorem 5.5. Conditions (1) or (2) imply that M is perfect by\nLemma 3.7. It remains to show that condition (3) implies that g\u0393 is perfect. It\nsuffices to consider the case where g is simple. If \u0393 acts on g by diagram automorphisms, then there are two possibilities: either \u0393 is a cyclic group generated by a\nsingle diagram automorphism or g is of type D4 and \u0393 \u223c\n= S3 . If \u0393 is generated by a\nsingle diagram automorphism, it is well known that g\u0393 is a simple Lie algebra and\nhence perfect (see [Kac90, \u00a78.2]). The case \u0393 \u223c\n= S3 was described in Example 3.13,\nwhere it was shown that g\u0393 is simple as well.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.9. Note that the three conditions in Corollary 5.8 depend only on the\naction of \u0393 on g and not on the scheme X or its \u0393-action.\nRemark 5.10 (Untwisted map algebras). If \u0393 is trivial (or, more generally, acts\ntrivially on g), we have g\u0393 = g. Thus the map E \u2192 S, \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 , is a bijection\nif and only if g is perfect. In the case when \u0393 is trivial, g is a finite-dimensional\nsimple Lie algebra, and A is finitely generated, a similar statement has recently\nbeen made in [CFK].\nCorollary 5.11. Suppose that all irreducible finite-dimensional representations of\nM are evaluation representations (e.g. M is perfect) and that all gx , x \u2208 Xrat , are\nsemisimple. Then a finite-dimensional M-module V is completely reducible if and\nonly if there exists x \u2208 Xn for some n \u2208 N, n > 0, such that Ker evx \u2286 AnnM V :=\n{\u03b1 \u2208 M : \u03b1 * v = 0 \u2200 v \u2208 V }.\nFor the case of the current algebra M = g \u2297 C[t], this corollary is proven in\n[CG05, Prop. 3.9(iii)].\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\nProof. Let V be a completely reducible M-module, hence a finite direct sum of\n(i)\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations V (i) . By assumption, every\nT V is an\n(i)\nevaluation representation, given by some x \u2208 Xni . Then AnnM V = i AnnM V (i) \u2287\nS (i)\nT\ni x . Since Ker evx = Ker evg*x , we can replace\ni Ker evx(i) = Ker evy for y =\ny by some x \u2208 Xn satisfying Ker evy = Ker evx .\nConversely, if Ker evx \u2286 AnnM (VL\n), then the representation of M on V factors\nthrough the semisimple Lie algebra x\u2208x gx and is therefore completely reducible.\n\u0003\nWhile Theorem 5.5 classifies all the irreducible finite-dimensional representations\nof an arbitrary equivariant map algebra, in case M is not perfect it leaves open the\npossibility that not all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation\nrepresentations. We see that M has irreducible finite-dimensional representations\nthat are not evaluation representations precisely when it has one-dimensional representations that are not evaluation representations. We therefore turn our attention\nto one-dimensional evaluation representations. Let\nX\u0303 = {x \u2208 Xrat : [gx , gx ] 6= gx }.\nNote that X\u0303 is a \u0393-invariant subset of X (i.e. X\u0303 is a union of \u0393-orbits).\nLemma 5.12. If ev\u03a8 is (the isomorphism class of ) a one-dimensional representation, then supp \u03a8 \u2286 X\u0303.\n\nProof. This follows easily from the fact that for x \u2208 X \\ X\u0303 we have that gx is\nperfect and thus the one-dimensional representations of gx are trivial.\n\u0003\nLet\nMd = {\u03b1 \u2208 M : \u03b1(x) \u2208 [gx , gx ] \u2200 x \u2208 Xrat } = {\u03b1 \u2208 M : \u03b1(x) \u2208 [gx , gx ] \u2200 x \u2208 X\u0303}.\n\nThen it is easy to see that [M, M] \u2286 Md . The proof of the following lemma is\nstraightforward.\nLemma 5.13. The Lie algebra M is perfect if and only if Md = [M, M] and X\u0303 = \u2205.\nNow assume that |X\u0303| < \u221e. Let x be a set of representatives of the \u0393-orbits\ncomprising X\u0303 and consider the composition\nevx\n\u03c0 / / L\nx\nx\n//L\nzx := gx /[gx , gx ],\n(5.6)\nM\nx\u2208x g\nx\u2208x z ,\n\nwhere the x-component of \u03c0 is the canonical projection gx \u2192 gx /[gx , gx ]. If g is\nreductive, then so is every gx , and we can identify zx with the center Z(gx ) of gx .\nHowever, we will not assume that g is reductive. The kernel of (5.6) is precisely\nMd , and thus the composition factors through M/[M, M], yielding the following\ncommutative diagram:\nevx\n\u03c0 / / L\nx\n//L\n(5.7)\nM\u25a0\ngx\nx\u2208x z\nx\u2208x\n\u25a0\u25a0\n8\n8\nq\n\u25a0\u25a0\nq\n\u25a0\u25a0\nqqq\nq\n\u25a0\u25a0\nq\n\u03b3\n\u25a0$ $\nqqq\nM/[M, M]\nWe then have an isomorphism of vector spaces,\nL\n(5.8)\n(M/[M, M])\u2217 \u223c\n= (ker \u03b3)\u2217 \u2295\n\n\u0001\nx \u2217\nx\u2208x z\n\n.\n\n\f20\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\nProposition 5.14.

Then [M, M] = Md if and only if all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations.\nProof. By Theorem 5.15, all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations if and only if \u03b3 is injective (and hence an isomorphism, since\nit is surjective). Then the result follows from the commutative diagram (5.7) since\nthe kernel of (5.6) is Md .\n\u0003\nRemark 5.17. Note that if g is perfect and \u0393 acts on X in such a way that there\nare only a finite number of points of X that have a non-trivial stabilizer, then\n|X\u0303| < \u221e, and so the hypotheses of Theorem 5.15 are satisfied.\n\nRemark 5.18. In Section 6.3 we will see that the Onsager algebra is an equivariant\nmap algebra which is not perfect but for which \u03b3 is injective, and thus all irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations are nonetheless evaluation representations.\nHaving considered the case when all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations, we now examine the opposite situation: Equivariant map algebras for which there exist irreducible finite-dimensional representations that are not evaluation representations.\n\nProposition 5.19. Suppose X is a Noetherian affine scheme and X\u0303 is infinite.\nThen M has a one-dimensional representation that is not an evaluation representation.\nProof. We first set up some notation for one-dimensional evaluation representations.\nLet x \u2208 Xn and let \u03c1x : gx \u2192 Endk (Vx ), x \u2208 x, be representations such that\nevx (\u03c1x )x\u2208x is N\na one-dimensional representation.\nNecessarily dim Vx = 1, say Vx =\nN\nkvx , so V =\nx\u2208x vx . We can assume that all \u03c1x 6= 0,\nx\u2208x Vx = kv for v =\nx \u2217\nx\nwhence\nP x \u2286 X\u0303. Let \u03c1\u0303x \u2208 (g ) be defined by \u03c1x (u)(vx ) = \u03c1\u0303x (u)vx for u \u2208 g .

Because X H has only finitely many\nirreducible components, there exists an irreducible component Y of X H such that\n\u1ef8 = Y \u2229 XH is infinite.\nLet R : A\u0393X \u2192 AY be the restriction map. Choose an infinite set {y1 , y2 , . . . }\nof points of Y , no two of which are in the same \u0393-orbit. It follows as in the proof\nof Corollary 4.6 that for all j \u2208 N there exists fj \u2208 A\u0393X such that fj (yj ) 6= 0 and\nfj (yi ) = 0 for i < j. Since the set {R(fj ) : j \u2208 N} is linearly independent, the image\nof R is infinite-dimensional. Because A\u0393X is finitely generated, so is the image of R.\nTherefore, by the Noether normalization lemma, this image contains an element fY\nsuch that the set {1, fY , fY2 , . . . , } is linearly independent. Choose f \u2208 R\u22121 (fY ).\nIt follows that {1, f, f 2 , . . . , } is also linearly independent. Since \u1ef8 is open in the\nirreducible Y we can choose \u1ef9 \u2208 \u1ef8 such that f (\u1ef9) 6= 0.\nH\nLet {ui }li=1 be a basis of [gH , gH ], and complete it to a basis {ui }m\ni=1 of g .\nn\nThen complete this to a basis {ui }i=1 of g. Again by Corollary 4.6 there exists\n\u03b1 \u2208 MP\nsuch that \u03b1(\u1ef9) = um . Observe that \u03b1Y = \u03b1|Y can be written in the form\nm\n\u03b1Y =\ni=1 ui \u2297 fi for some fi \u2208 AY . Since \u03b1(\u1ef9) = um , we have fm (\u1ef9) = 1.\nTherefore fm (y) 6= 0 for all y in some dense subset of Y . Now suppose\n\u221e\nX\nj=0\n\ndj \u03b1f j \u2208 [M, M]\n\nfor some dj \u2208 k with dj = 0 for all but finitely many j.

Because\n{1, fY , fY2 , . . . } is linearly independent, we must have dj = 0 for all j. Therefore\nSpan{\u03b1f m : m \u2208 N} \u2229 [M, M] = 0.\nNow observe that the preceding\nalso shows that {\u03b1, \u03b1f, \u03b1f 2 , . . . } is linP\u221e argument\nj\nearly independent: Suppose j=1 cj \u03b1f = 0 for some cj \u2208 k with cj = 0 for all but\nfinitely many j. Then, since 0 \u2208 [M, M], all cj = 0 by what we have just shown.\nThus (\u2217) holds, finishing the proof of the proposition.\n\u0003\nExample 5.20. We give an example in which the assumptions of Proposition 5.19\nare fulfilled. Let \u0393 = {1, \u03c3} be the group of order two acting on g = sl2 (k) by the\nChevalley involution with respect to some sl2 -triple and let X be the affine space k 2\nwith \u03c3 acting on X by fixing the first coordinate of points in X while multiplying\nthe second by \u22121. For points (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 X with x2 6= 0, the isotropy subalgebra\ngx = g, while for (x1 , 0) \u2208 X, the subalgebra gx is the fixed point subalgebra of \u03c3,\nwhich is one-dimensional. Therefore X\u0303 = {(x1 , 0) \u2208 X} is infinite.\nProposition 5.19 says that when X is an affine variety, a necessary condition for\nall irreducible finite-dimensional representations to be evaluation representations is\nthat X\u0303 be finite. We now show that this condition is not sufficient.\nExample 5.21. Let g = sl2 (k) and\nX = Z(y 2 \u2212 x3 ) = {(y, x) : y 2 = x3 } \u2286 k 2 ,\nan affine variety. Then A = k[y, x]/(y 2 \u2212 x3 ). Let \u0393 = h\u03c3i = Z2 act on k 2 by\n\u03c3 * y = \u2212y and \u03c3 * x = x. Since this action fixes y 2 \u2212 x3 , we have an induced action\nof \u0393 on X and the only fixed point is the origin. In particular, X\u0303 only contains the\norigin and thus is finite. We let \u03c3 act on g by a Chevalley involution. We have\nA1 = yk[y 2 , x]/(y 2 \u2212 x3 ),\nand so\nA21 = y 2 k[y 2 , x]/(y 2 \u2212 x3 ) \u223c\n= x3 k[x],\nwhile\nA0 = A\u0393 = k[y 2 , x]/(y 2 \u2212 x3 ) \u223c\n= k[x].\nRecall that g0 is one-dimensional. Then\n\u0001\n[M, M] = ([g0 , g0 ] \u2297 A0 + g0 \u2297 A21 ) \u2295 (g1 \u2297 A1 ) = g0 \u2297 x3 k[x] \u2295 (g1 \u2297 A1 ) ,\n\nwhile\n\nMd = (g0 \u2297 xk[x]) \u2295 (g1 \u2297 A1 ) .\nTherefore\nMd /[M, M] \u223c\n= xk[x]/(x3 ),\nand by Theorem 5.15, M has irreducible finite-dimensional representations that are\nnot evaluation representations.\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n23\n\n6. Applications\nIn this section we use our classification to describe the irreducible finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of certain equivariant map algebras. The classification of these representations for the multiloop, tetrahedron, or Onsager algebra O(sl2 ) by the results\nobtained in Section 5 provide a simplified and unified interpretation of results previously obtained. For example, the classification of the irreducible finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of L\u03c3 (g) (as found in [CP01] and [CFS08]) via Drinfeld polynomials\nrequires two distinct treatments for the untwisted (\u03c3 = Id) and twisted (\u03c3 6= Id)\ncases \u2013 for these twisted cases, the twisted loops L\u03c3 (g) with g of type A2n require\nspecial attention. The classification resulting from our approach, however, is uniform. As we will see, the identification of isomorphism classes of representations\nwith equivariant maps Xrat \u2192 RX also provides a simple explanation for many of\nthe technical conditions appearing in previous classifications.\nWe first note that from Remark 5.10 we immediately obtain the classification of\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations of the current algebras (Example 2.4),\nof the untwisted loop and multiloop algebras (Example 2.5), and of the n-point algebras M (X, g), where X = P1 \\ {c1 , . . . , cn }. This includes the tetrahedron\nalgebra,\u0003\n\u0002\nwhich is isomorphic to the three-point sl2 loop algebra sl2 \u2297 C t, t\u22121 , (t \u2212 1)\u22121\n(Example 2.6), and we recover the classification found in [Har07]. In particular,\nwe easily recover in all of these cases the fact that for x = {x1 , . . . , xl } \u2286 X and\nirreducible representations V1 , . . . , Vl of g, the evaluation representation evx (\u2297Vi )\nis irreducible if and only if xi 6= xj for i 6= j.\n6.1. Multiloop algebras. If M = M (g, \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n , m1 , . . . , mn ) is a multiloop algebra (Example 3.12), then M is perfect (M is an iterated loop algebra; see [ABP06,\nLemma 4.9]). Therefore, by Corollary 5.8 we have the following classification:\nCorollary 6.1. The map E \u2192 S, \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 , is a bijection. In particular, all\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation representations.\nThe irreducible finite-dimensional representations of an arbitrary multiloop algebra have been discussed in [Bat04] and [Lau]. With Corollary 6.1 we recover\nthe recent results in [Lau], which subsume all previous classifications of irreducible\nfinite-dimensional representations of loop algebras. We note that these previous\nclassifications involved some rather complicated algebraic conditions on points of\nevaluation (see, for example, [Lau, Theorem 5.7]). However, in the approach of\nTheorem 5.5, such conditions are not necessary. In fact, we see that the presence\nof these algebraic conditions arises from the description of evaluation representations in terms of individual points rather than as equivariant maps (i.e. elements\nof E). For instance, if M = M (g, \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n , m1 , . . . , mn ) is an arbitrary multiloop algebra and \u03a8 \u2208 E, then ev\u03a8 is the isomorphism class evx (\u03a8(xi ))li=1 , where\nx = {x1 , . . . , xl } \u2208 Xl contains one element from each \u0393-orbit in supp \u03a8 and this\nclass is independent of the choice of x (Definition 4.7). It is immediate that such\nmn\nm1\nm\nm\nan x must satisfy the condition that xm\n1 , . . . , xl (where xi = (xi1 , . . . , xin ) for\n\u00d7 n\nxi = (xi1 , . . . , xin )) are pairwise distinct in (k ) . We therefore recover the conditions on the points xi found in [Lau, Theorem 5.7] which are necessary and sufficient\nfor evx1 ,...,xl (\u2297Vi ) to be irreducible. The other conditions found there are similarly\nexplained.\n\n\f24\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\n6.2. Connections to Drinfeld polynomials. In [CP01], [CM04], [CFS08] and\n[Sen10a], the isomorphism classes of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of\nloop algebras L(g), L\u03c3 (g) are parameterized by certain collections of polynomials,\nsometimes referred to as Drinfeld polynomials. Here we explain the relationship\nbetween this parametrization and ours. For better comparison with the existing\nliterature, we assume in this subsection that k = C.\nDenote by P the set of of n-tuples of polynomials with constant term 1:\nP = {\u03c0 = (\u03c01 (u), . . . , \u03c0n (u)) : \u03c0i \u2208 C [u] , \u03c0i (0) = 1} .\n\nThen the set P is in bijective correspondence with the isomorphism classes of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of L(g) ([CP01, Proposition 2.1]). To the\nelement \u03c0 \u2208 P we associate an irreducible representation V (\u03c0) (the construction\nof V (\u03c0) is given in [CP01]). We describe this correspondence.\nFix a simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra g, denote by n its rank,\nLn and fix a\nCartan decomposition gL\n= n\u2212 \u2295 h \u2295 n+ with Cartan subalgebra h = i=1 Chi \u2286 g\nn\nn\nand weight lattice P = i=1 Z\u03c9i , with fundamental weights {\u03c9i }i=1 , \u03c9i (hj ) = \u03b4ij .\nSn \b\nl\nLet \u03c0 = (\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0n ) \u2208 P and {xi }i=1 = j=1 z \u2208 C\u00d7 : \u03c0j (z \u22121 ) = 0 .

For i = 1, . . . , l, define \u03bbi \u2208 P + by \u03bbi (hj ) = Nij , and\nlet \u03c1i : g \u2192 Endk (V (\u03bbi )) be the corresponding irreducible finite-dimensional representation of g.

This fact follows immediately from Proposition 4.19\n\n\fREPRESENTATIONS OF EQUIVARIANT MAP ALGEBRAS\n\n25\n\nonce we note that in the setup of multiloop algebras, the action of \u0393 on X = C\u00d7 is\nvia multiplication by roots of unity and hence is free. Thus gx = g\u0393x = g{Id} = g\nfor all x \u2208 X. Of course, the approach of the current paper yields an enumeration\nby elements of E. The induced identification of E with P \u03c3 is somewhat technical\nand will not be described here, but can found in [Sen10b].\n6.3. The generalized Onsager algebra. Our results also provide a classification\nof the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the generalized Onsager algebra O(g) introduced in Example 3.9 (in fact, for the more general equivariant map\nalgebra of Example 3.10). For g 6= sl2 this classification was previously unknown.\n\nProposition 6.2. Let g be a simple Lie algebra, X = Spec k[t\u00b11 ], and \u0393 = {1, \u03c3}\nbe a group of order two. Suppose \u03c3 acts on X by \u03c3 * x = x\u22121 , x \u2208 X, and on g\nby an automorphism of order two. Then the map E \u2192 S, \u03a8 7\u2192 ev\u03a8 , is a bijection. In particular, all irreducible finite-dimensional representations are evaluation\nrepresentations. In particular, this is true for the generalized Onsager algebra O(g).\n\nProof. Recall that g0 = g\u0393 is either semisimple or has a one-dimensional center.\nIn the case when g0 is semisimple, the result follows from Corollary 5.8 and (3.6).\nWe thus assume that Z(g0 ) \u223c\n= g0 /[g0 , g0 ] is one-dimensional. By (3.6), we have\nM/[M, M] \u223c\n= A0 /A21 , a Lie algebra with trivial Lie bracket. Now, A0 = k[t + t\u22121 ]\nand A1 = (t \u2212 t\u22121 )A0 . Thus, setting z = t + t\u22121 , we have\nA0 /A2 \u223c\n= k[z]/hz 2 \u2212 4i,\n1\n\nwhich is a two-dimensional vector space. The points 1 andL\n\u22121 are each \u0393-fixed\npoints, and so we must take x = {\u00b11} in (5.7). Therefore x\u2208x Z(gx ) is also a\ntwo-dimensional vector space, and so the map \u03b3 in (5.7) is injective (since it is\nsurjective). The result then follows from Theorem 5.15.\n\u0003\n\nIn the special case g = sl2 , k = C, the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of O(sl2 ) were described in [DR00] as follows. Let {e, h, f } be an sl2 -triple\nand define X = (e + f ) \u2297 1 and Y = e \u2297 t + f \u2297 t\u22121 . Then O(sl2 ) is generated\nby X, Y . Furthermore, if V is an irreducible finite-dimensional representation of\nO(sl2 ), then X and Y are diagonalizable on V , and there exists an integer d \u2265 0\nand scalars \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2217 \u2208 k such that the set of distinct eigenvalues of X (resp. Y ) on V\nis {d \u2212 2i + \u03b3 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d} (resp. {d \u2212 2i + \u03b3 \u2217 : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d}) [Har07, Corollary 2.7].\nThe ordered pair (\u03b3, \u03b3 \u2217 ) is called the type of V . Replacing X, Y by X \u2212 \u03b3I, Y \u2212 \u03b3 \u2217 I\n(in the universal enveloping algebra U (O(sl2 )) of O(sl2 )) the type becomes (0, 0).\nLet evx1 V1 , . . . , evxn Vn denote a finite sequence of evaluation modules for O(sl2 ),\nand V the evaluation module evx1 V1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 evxn Vn . Any module that can be obtained from V by permuting the order of the factors and replacing any number of\nthe xi 's with their multiplicative inverses will be called equivalent to V . The classification of irreducible finite-dimensional O(sl2 )-modules of type (0, 0) is described\nin [DR00] as follows.\nProposition 6.3.\n(1) [DR00, Theorem 6] Every non-trivial irreducible finite-dimensional O(sl2 )module of type (0, 0) is isomorphic to a tensor product of evaluation modules.\n(2) [DR00, Proposition 5] Let evx1 V1 , . . . , evxn Vn denote a finite sequence of\nevaluation modules for O(sl2 ), and consider the O(sl2 )-module evx1 V1 \u2297\n\n\f26\n\nERHARD NEHER, ALISTAIR SAVAGE, AND PRASAD SENESI\n\u22121\n* * * \u2297 evxn Vn . This module is irreducible if and only if x1 , x\u22121\n1 , . . . , xn , xn\nare pairwise distinct.\n(3) [DR00, Proposition 5] Let U and V denote tensor products of finitely many\nevaluation modules for O(sl2 ). Assume each of U , V is irreducible as an\nO(sl2 )-module. Then the O(sl2 )-modules U and V are isomorphic if and\nonly if they are equivalent.\n\nThese results are immediate consequences of Proposition 6.2. The type (0, 0)\nrepresentations are precisely the evaluation representations ev\u03a8 such that {\u00b11} \u2229\nsupp \u03a8 = \u2205. We note that under the previous definition of evaluation representations appearing in the literature (see Remark 4.8), only type (0, 0) representations\nare evaluation representations. However, using Definition 4.7, all irreducible finitedimensional representations (of arbitrary type) are evaluation representations. The\nkey is that we allow one-dimensional representations of gx for x \u2208 {\u00b11}, where gx\nis one-dimensional. Thus our definition allows for a more uniform description of\nthe representations. The condition that the points x1 , x1\u22121 , . . . , xn , x\u22121\nn be pairwise\ndistinct also follows automatically as in the case of multiloop algebras.\n6.4. A non-abelian example. Let g = so8 , X = P1 \\ {0, 1, \u221e} and \u0393 = S3 as\nin Example 3.13, and let M = M (X, g)\u0393 . Since M is perfect, by Corollary 5.8 all\nirreducible finite-dimensional representations of M are evaluation representations\nand these are naturally enumerated by E. We identify \u0393 = S3 with the permutations\nof the set {0, 1, \u221e} and use the usual cycle notation for permutations. For instance,\n(0 \u221e) denotes the permutation given by 0 7\u2192 \u221e, \u221e 7\u2192 0, 1 7\u2192 1. A straightforward\ncomputation shows that the points with non-trivial stabilizer are listed in the table\nbelow (note that {0, 1, \u221e} 6\u2208 X). Each gx is the fixed point algebra of a diagram\nautomorphism of g and thus a simple Lie algebra of type B3 or G2 .\nx\n\u22121\n2\ne\n\n1\n2\n\u00b1\u03c0i/3\n\n\u0393x\n{Id, (0 \u221e)} \u223c\n= Z2\n{Id, (1 \u221e)} \u223c\n= Z2\n{Id, (0 1)} \u223c\n= Z2\n{Id, (0 1 \u221e), (0 \u221e 1)} \u223c\n= Z3\n\nType of gx\nB3\nB3\nB3\nG2\n\nFurthermore, the sets {\u22121, 2, 12 } and {e\u03c0i/3 , e\u2212\u03c0i/3 } are \u0393-orbits. We thus see\nthat the representation theory of M is quite rich. Elements of E can assign to\nthe three-element orbit (the isomorphism class of) any irreducible representation\nof the simple Lie algebra of type B3 , to the two-element orbit any irreducible\nrepresentation of the simple Lie algebra of type G2 and to any of the other (sixelement) orbits, any irreducible representation of the simple Lie algebra g of type\nD4 .\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Michael Lau for having explained the results of a preprint\nof [Lau] to them before it was posted, and Oliver Schiffmann and Mark Haiman\nfor helpful discussions concerning the geometry of algebraic varieties.
