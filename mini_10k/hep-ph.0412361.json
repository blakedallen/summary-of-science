The relativistic flux tube model (RFTM) is a\nphenomenological model based on this picture [1, 2]. More recently, the rotating string\nmodel (RSM) has been derived from the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian as an effective model\nwhich also describes a meson as a quark and an antiquark linked by a string [3, 4]. The\nphysical content of these models is very similar, and it has been shown that they are actually\nclassically equivalent once the auxiliary fields appearing in the RSM are completely eliminated [5, 6]. A rather good description of the experimental meson spectrum can be obtained\nwith the original RFTM supplemented by a Coulomb term [7]. But unfortunately, a strong\ncoupling constant larger than what it is expected from experimental analysis and lattice\nsimulations must be considered. The necessity of finding new contributions arising from\nneglected physical mechanisms is thus clear. Recently, a quark self energy (QSE) contribution was introduced, which is due to the color magnetic moment of the quark propagating\nthrough the vacuum [8]. The QSE brings a negative contribution to the hadron masses,\nand seems to be an interesting way of reproducing the experimental data with a smaller\nCoulomb term.\nOur purpose here is to study the influence of the QSE on the meson masses, especially\nusing the RFTM. Our paper is organized as follows. The Sec. II is a short presentation of\nboth classical RFTM and RSM, where we also underline their classical equivalence. Since\nthe equations describing these models are quite complicated, approximate equations are\ndeveloped in Sec. III, from which an analytical mass formula is derived in Sec. IV. In\nSec. V, the quality of the approximate equations are compared with the original quantized\nRFTM. We then introduce the QSE in Sec. VI and discuss its effects on the meson spectrum\nin Sec. VII. A comparison with experimental data is performed in Sec. VIII. Finally, some\nconcluding remarks are outlined in Sec. IX.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nROTATING STRING AND RELATIVISTIC FLUX TUBE\n\nWe will present in this section two effective meson models : the rotating string model\n(RSM) and the relativistic flux tube model (RFTM). Our purpose is to give a presentation\nof the principal features of these models, and to underline their classical equivalence.\nIt has been shown in Ref. [3] that starting from the QCD Lagrangian, the Lagrange\nfunction of a meson with spinless quarks can be built from the Nambu-Goto action. For two\nquarks with masses m1 and m2 , and a string with tension a, this action has the well-known\nform\nL = \u2212m1\n\nq\n\n\u1e8b21\n\n\u2212 m2\n\nq\n\n\u1e8b22\n\n\u2212a\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nq\nd\u03b2 (\u1e87w \u2032)2 \u2212 \u1e87 2 w \u2032 2 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn this action, xi is the coordinate of quark i and w is the coordinate of the string. w depends\non two variables defined on the string worldsheet : one is spacelike \u03b2 and the other timelike\n\u03c4 . We have also defined w \u2032 = \u2202\u03b2 w and \u1e87 = \u2202\u03c4 w. Introducing auxiliary fields (also known\nas einbein fields) to get rid of the square root in (1) and making the straight line ansatz to\ndescribe the string connecting the quark and the antiquark, an effective Hamiltonian can be\nderived, which reads [9]\n\u0014\n1 p2r + m21 p2r + m22\n+\n+ \u03bc1 + \u03bc2\nH(\u03bci , \u03bd) =\n2\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc2\n#\nZ 1\nZ 1\n2\n2\nd\u03b2\nL /r\n+a2 r 2\n+\nd\u03b2\u03bd +\n.\nR1\n2\n\u03bd\n[\u03bc1 (1 \u2212 \u03b6) + \u03bc2 \u03b6 2 + d\u03b2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b6)2 \u03bd]\n0\n0\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\npr is the common radial quark momentum. The parameter \u03b6 defines the position R of the\ncenter of mass: R = \u03b6x1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b6)x2 , and L is the orbital angular momentum of the system.\nThe auxiliary fields \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 are seen as effective masses of the quarks whose current masses\nare m1 and m2 . The last auxiliary field, \u03bd, can be interpreted in the same way as an effective\nenergy for the string whose \"static\" energy is ar. One can get rid of these auxiliary fields\nby a variation of the Hamiltonian (2). Their extremal values, denoted as \u03bci 0 and \u03bd0 , are the\nsolutions of\n\u03b4H(\u03bci , \u03bd)\n\u03b4\u03bci\n\u03b4H(\u03bci , \u03bd)\n\u03b4\u03bd\n\n3\n\n= 0,\n\n(3a)\n\n\u03bci =\u03bci 0\n\n= 0.\n\u03bd=\u03bd0\n\n(3b)\n\n\fThe equations of the RSM can be derived from the Hamiltonian (2) by the elimination\nof \u03bd thanks to the condition (3b) [4]. We will consider in this paper the symmetrical case,\nwhere m1 = m2 = m and \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = \u03bc:\np\np\nl(l + 1)\n\u03bcy\n1\n=\n+ 2 (arcsin y \u2212 y 1 \u2212 y 2),\n2\nar\nar 4y\nH RS(\u03bc) =\n\n(4a)\n\nar\npr2 + m2\n+\u03bc+\narcsin y + \u03bcy 2 .\n\u03bc\ny\n\n(4b)\n\nIn the general case, where m1 6= m2 , a third equation has to be taken into account, which\nexpresses the cancellation of the total momentum in the center of mass frame [6]. If one\nconsiders \u03bc as a number, one can directly solve Eqs. (4) and find the meson mass, after a\nminimization of this mass with respect to \u03bc [4].\nSince the RSM equations contain the remaining auxiliary field \u03bc and a variable y whose\nphysical interpretation is not a priori clear, it appears interesting to go a step further and\nto get rid of \u03bc. As it is shown in Ref. [5], the elimination of \u03bc with the condition (3) leads\nto the extremal value\n\u03bc0 =\n\ns\n\np2r + m2\n.\n1 \u2212 y2\n\n(5)\n\nMoreover, the replacement of \u03bc by \u03bc0 in Eqs. (4) leads to the following expressions\nL\n1\n= v\u22a5 \u03b3\u22a5 Wr + f (v\u22a5 ),\n2\nar\nar\n\nH RS (\u03bc0 ) = H RFT = 2\u03b3\u22a5 Wr + ar\n\n(6a)\n\narcsin v\u22a5\n,\nv\u22a5\n\n(6b)\n\nwhere we have defined\ny = v\u22a5 ,\n\n1\n,\n\u03b3\u22a5 = p\n2\n1 \u2212 v\u22a5\n\nf (v\u22a5 ) =\n\narcsin v\u22a5\n1\n\u2212\n2\n4v\u22a5\n4v\u22a5 \u03b3\u22a5\n\nand Wr =\n\np\np2r + m2 .\n\n(7)\n\nEqs. (6) are precisely those of the RFTM as they appear in Ref. [1]. The mysterious variable\ny is now simply interpreted as the transverse velocity v\u22a5 of the quarks, and the physical\ncontent of \u03bc is clarified. Using definitions (7), we can rewrite (5) in the form\n\u03bc0 = Wr \u03b3\u22a5 .\n\n(8)\n\nOriginally, the RFTM was built on phenomenological arguments. But our derivation of\nthe RFTM shows that it can be derived from the Nambu- Goto Lagrangian. We also clearly\n4\n\n\fsee the equivalence of the RSM and RFTM, when the auxiliary fields are eliminated. Let\nus note that this equivalence is also true in general, with m1 6= m2 [6].\nBy application of the usual correspondence rules\np2r \u2192 \u2212\n\n1 \u22022\nr\nr \u2202r 2\n\nand L \u2192\n\np\n\nl(l + 1),\n\nthe quantized equations of the RFTM are given by [1]\np\n2 l(l + 1)\n= {v\u22a5 \u03b3\u22a5 , Wr } + a{r, f (v\u22a5 )},\nr\narcsin v\u22a5\na\n}.\nH RFT = {\u03b3\u22a5 , Wr } + {r,\n2\nv\u22a5\n\n(9)\n\n(10a)\n\n(10b)\n\nThe anticommutators {A, B} = AB + BA arise because v\u22a5 , r, and pr are non commuting\noperators.\nThe quantized equations of the RSM, which are not used here, are given in Ref. [10]. The\ndiagonalization of Hamiltonian H RFT directly provides the physical masses M RFT . Equations (10) can be numerically solved, as it is done in Refs. [7, 10]. Supplemented by an\nappropriate short range potentials, like a Coulomb term, the quantized RFTM can rather\nwell reproduce the meson spectra [7].\n\nIII.\n\nSTRING AS A PERTURBATION\n\nWhen l = 0, the RFTM reduces to a spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian (SSH) with a linear\nconfinement potential ar [1]. If l is small, the contribution of the string is also small, and\nthen it can be treated as a perturbation of the SSH. We will show that the contribution of\nthe string can be obtained by two different procedures, that lead to different definition of\nthe auxiliary field \u03bc0 .\nLet us start with the RSM and consider that the transverse velocity of the quarks is\nsmall: y \u226a 1. We can develop formulas (4) at the second order in y.

We see that H A (\u03bc) is\nthe sum of an usual SSH with linear confinement in the auxiliary field formalism [5]\nH SS (\u03bc) =\n\np~ 2 + m2\n+ \u03bc + ar,\n\u03bc\n\n(13)\n\nand a specific contribution of the string, which reads\n\u2206Hstr (\u03bc) = \u2212\n\nal(l + 1)\n.\nr\u03bc(6\u03bc + ar)\n\n(14)\n\nSince we want to treat \u2206Hstr (\u03bc) as a perturbation, we will eliminate \u03bc with the condition (3a)\napplied for the Hamiltonian H SS (\u03bc). This leads to the extremal value\n\u03bc0 =\n\np\n\np~ 2 + m2 ,\n\n(15)\n\nand after replacement in (13), to the spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian\np\nH SS = 2 p~ 2 + m2 + ar.\n\n(16)\n\nLet us note that formula (15) is different from the extremal value (8).

This string contribution\nwas previously obtained in Ref. [11], where it is shown that its accuracy is better than 3%.\nWe can now invert the order of the operations: Firstly to eliminate \u03bc in the RSM and\nobtain the RFTM, then make the same approximation as before. When v\u22a5 \u226a 1, the RFTM\nequations can be developed at the second order in v\u22a5 and we have\np\nl(l + 1)\n\u0001,\nv\u22a5 \u2248\nr Wr + ar\n6\nH\n\nRFT\n\n\u2248 2Wr + ar +\n6\n\n2\nv\u22a5\n\n\u0010\n\nar \u0011\nWr +\n.\n6\n\n(18a)\n\n(18b)\n\n\fReplacing Eq.

We immediately\nsee that formulas (17) and (25) are different. In Sec. V, we will study the qualities of both\ncorrections.\n\nIV.\n\nA MASS FORMULA\n\nIn the following, we will specially focus on the massless case, m = 0, for which we can\nexpect the largest contributions of the flux tube (\u03bc increases with the quark mass). In this\n7\n\n\fcase, it is possible to find an approximate analytical mass formula. This will allow a better\nunderstanding of the effects of the QSE (see Sec. VI C). Starting from the Hamiltonian (12),\nwe define dimensionless conjugate variables ~x and ~q by the following scaling\n~r =\n\n~x\n(\u03bca)1/3\n\nand ~p = (\u03bca)1/3 ~q.\n\n(26)\n\nIn this section, we treat the auxiliary field \u03bc as a number [8, 11]. We can write the Hamiltonian (12) in the form\nSS\n\nH (\u03bc) =\n\n\u0012\n\na2\n\u03bc\n\n\u00131/3\n\n\u0001\n~q 2 + x + \u03bc,\n\nwith x = |~x |. Its eigenvalues are consequently\n\u0012 2 \u00131/3\na\nSS\nM (\u03bc; nl) =\n\u01ebnl + \u03bc,\n\u03bc\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u01ebnl is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian (~q 2 + x), which is easy to solve numerically.\nSimple analytical approximate expressions of \u01ebnl can be found for \u01ebn0 [5] and \u01eb0l [12]\n\u0013\u00152/3\n\u0014 \u0012\n3\n3\u03c0\n2n +\n\u01ebn0 \u2248\n,\n(29a)\n4\n2\n\u01eb0l \u2248\n\n3\n22/3\n\n#2/3\n\u00131/3 \"\n\u0012\n3\n\u0393(l + 2)\n\u0001\nl+\n.\n2\n\u0393 l + 32\n\n(29b)\n\nA more complicated approximate formula exists also in the general case [13].\nAssuming that the quantities \u01ebnl are known, we can compute the extremal value of \u03bc by\na minimization of relation (28), which leads to\n\u221a \u0010 \u01ebnl \u00113/4\n,\n\u03bc0 nl = a\n3\n\n(30)\n\nand\n\nSS\nMnl\n(\u03bc0 nl ) = 4\u03bc0 nl .\n\n(31)\n\nWe will now drop the explicit dependence in n and l of the different terms to simplify the\nnotations. The perturbation theory tells us that the total energy is\nM A (\u03bc0 ) = 4\u03bc0 \u2212\n\nal(l + 1)\n,\nhri\u03bc0(6\u03bc0 + ahri)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere h1/ri is replaced by 1/hri. The next step is to use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem\n[5, 14], which states that\nM SS (\u03bc0 ) = 4\u03bc0 = 2\u03bc0 + ahri.\n8\n\n(33)\n\n\fExtracting hri from relation (33) and replacing it in relation (32), we finally obtain the mass\nformula\nM A (\u03bc0 ) \u2248 4\u03bc0 \u2212\n\na2 l(l + 1)\n,\n16\u03bc30\n\n(34)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is given by formula (30).\nThe mass formula (34), even approximate, exhibits Regge trajectories. This can be easily\nchecked when n = 0. Using the fact that\nlim \u01eb0l \u2248 3\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0012\n\nl+\n2\n\n3 \u00132/3\n2\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwith formula (30), we obtain the following expression for the extremal value of the auxiliary\nfield at large values of l\n\u03bc0 \u2248\n\nr\n\nal\n.\n2\n\n(36)\n\nReplacing Eq. (36) into Eq. (34), we get\nM A (\u03bc0 )\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2248\n\n225\nal.\n32\n\n(37)\n\nThis linear relation between the squared mass and the angular momentum reproduces qualitatively the Regge trajectories. The Regge slope is here 7.03 a, a higher value than the one\npredicted by the RFTM, which gives a slope equal to 2\u03c0a [1]. Finally, we can observe that\nlim\n\nl\u2192\u221e\n\na2 l(l+1)\n16\u03bc30\n\n4\u03bc0\n\n=\n\n1\n.\n16\n\n(38)\n\nWhen l = 0, this ratio is vanishing. This justifies to treat the contribution of the string as\na perturbation.\n\nV.\n\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN EXACT AND APPROXIMATE STRING CON-\n\nTRIBUTION\n\nBefore studying the contribution of the QSE to the RFTM, it is interesting to examine\nthe relevance of the approximate treatment for the flux tube developed in Sec. III. For this\npurpose, we compare here some masses computed with the \"exact\" RFTM by numerically\nsolving Eqs. (10), as it is done for example in Ref. [10], with masses computed in the\nframework of the PFTM with both string corrections (17) and (25).\n\n9\n\n\fThe symbol ME designs a mass computed with the RFTM, and MP 1 , MP 2 the corresponding PFTM masses evaluated with the string corrections (17) and (25) respectively.\nThe quantities\n\u2206ME,P i =\n\nME \u2212 MP i\nME\n\n(39)\n\nmeasure the differences between the RFTM and its approximations.\nTABLE I: \u2206ME,P 1 (correction (17)) in %, for different states, with m = 0. l is the orbital angular\nmomentum of the state and n is the number of nodes at finite distance.\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nn=0\n\n3.26\n\n3.78\n\n4.01\n\n4.17\n\n4.29\n\n1\n\n1.08\n\n1.31\n\n1.53\n\n1.74\n\n1.94\n\n2\n\n0.68\n\n0.86\n\n1.04\n\n1.22\n\n1.40\n\n3\n\n0.46\n\n0.56\n\n0.68\n\n0.81\n\n0.95\n\n4\n\n0.36\n\n0.43\n\n0.52\n\n0.64\n\n0.76\n\n5\n\n0.29\n\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.49\n\n0.58\n\nl\n\nTable I presents the difference between the RFTM and the PFTM with correction (17).\nAs the basis of the approximation was to consider a small v\u22a5 , it is not surprising to see\nthat \u2206ME,P 1 increases with l. On the contrary, \u2206ME,P 1 decreases for an increasing radial\nquantum number n. This can be understood by the presence of the operator p2r in the\ndenominator of Eq. (17). This term becomes larger with n, and makes the contribution\nof the string smaller, leading to a decreasing of \u2206ME,P 1. Globally, the approximation\nconsidered in Table I is rather good, in particular when n \u2265 l.\nTable II presents the difference between the RFTM and the PFTM with correction (25).\nWhen n = 0, we immediately see that this approximation is not so good, because \u2206ME,P 2\nbecomes large very quickly with l. The situation is better for larger values of n, when\np\nour approximation Wr \u226b l(l + 1)/r, is particularly justified. But the evolution is less\n\nmonotonic than in Table I. In particular, for a fixed value of n, \u2206ME,P 2 decreases to a\nminimal value, and then increases again with l. In conclusion, in the framework of the\nPFTM, the correction (17), proposed in Ref. [11], seems preferable (even if the other one\ncan sometimes give a better result). It provides quite globally good results.\n\n10\n\n\fTABLE II: Same as in Table I but for \u2206ME,P 2 (correction (25)).\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nn=0\n\n1.03\n\n7.81\n\n15.21\n\n22.52\n\n29.54\n\n1\n\n0.44\n\n0.88\n\n2.55\n\n4.41\n\n6.36\n\n2\n\n0.40\n\n0.67\n\n0.73\n\n1.62\n\n2.64\n\n3\n\n0.35\n\n0.14\n\n0.23\n\n0.72\n\n1.30\n\n4\n\n0.31\n\n0.19\n\n0.02\n\n0.30\n\n0.66\n\n5\n\n0.26\n\n0.19\n\n0.06\n\n0.13\n\n0.37\n\nl\n\nVI.\nA.\n\nTHE QUARK SELF-ENERGY\nDefinition\n\nRecently, it was shown that the QSE contribution, which is created by the color magnetic\nmoment of the quark propagating through the vacuum background field, adds a negative\nconstant to the hadron masses [8]. Its negative sign is due to the paramagnetic nature of\nthe particular mechanism at work in this case. Using the Fock-Feynman-Schwinger representation of the quark Green's function, one can obtain the QSE contribution as a shift of\nthe squared mass of the quark [8, 15] which reads\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u2206m = \u22123m\ndz z 2 K1 (mz) (D(z) + D1 (z)) ,\n\n(40)\n\n0\n\nwhere D and D1 are quark correlators and K1 the Mac-Donald function. The properties\nof these correlators were studied by lattice simulations in the quenched case [16]. One has\nthen\nD(z) \u2248 3D1 (z) = D(0) exp(\u2212 |z| \u03b4),\n\n(41)\n\nwith \u03b4 = 1/Tg . Tg is the gluonic correlation length, whose value is estimated at about\n0.15-0.2 fm. This locates \u03b4 in the interval 1.0-1.3 GeV. The results (41) allow us to find an\nanalytic form for the integral (40)\n\u2206m2 = \u22124mD(0)\u03c6(m/\u03b4),\n\n11\n\n(42)\n\n\fwhere, defining \u01eb = m/\u03b4, we can write \u03c6(\u01eb) as\n\uf8f1\n#\n\"\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n1\n1\n+\n1\n\u2212\n\u01eb\n1\n+\n2\u01eb\n1\n\u22123\u01eb\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nln\n+\n= 3 \u03c61 (\u01eb) (\u01eb < 1)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b43\n5/2\n2\n2\n2\n\u01eb\n\u01eb (1 \u2212 \u01eb ) )\n\u03b4\n#\n\" (1 \u2212 \u01eb )\n\u03c6(\u01eb) =\n\uf8f4 1\n\u221a\n\u0001\n1\n\u22123\u01eb\n1 + 2\u01eb2\n\uf8f4\n2 \u22121 +\n\uf8f4\n= 3 \u03c62 (\u01eb) (\u01eb > 1).\n\u01eb\narctan\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b43\n5/2\n2\n2\n\u01eb (1 \u2212 \u01eb ) )\n\u03b4\n(\u01eb2 \u2212 1)\n\n(43)\n\nOne can check that \u03c61 (1) = \u03c62 (1) = 2/5, and that\n\n1\nlim \u03c61 (\u01eb) = .\n\u01eb\u21920\n\u01eb\n\n(44)\n\nFor a purely exponential correlator, as it is the case here, D(0) is connected with the\nstring tension a by the relation\n1\na=\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 x D(x) =\n\nso we find\n\u2206m2 = \u2212\n\n\u03c0D(0)\n,\n\u03b42\n\n4am\u03b4 2\n\u03c6(\u01eb).\n\u03c0\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nFor convenience, we define a new dimensionless function, \u03b7(\u01eb), by\n\u03b7(\u01eb) = \u03b4 3 \u01eb\u03c6(\u01eb).\n\n(47)\n\nWe see in Fig. 1 that \u03b7(0) = 1 and that \u03b7(\u01eb) rapidly decreases for increasing values of \u01eb.\n\nFIG. 1: Plot of \u03b7(\u01eb).\n\nThanks to the definition (47), Eq. (46) takes its final form [8]\n\u2206m2 = \u2212\n12\n\n4a\n\u03b7(\u01eb).\n\u03c0\n\n(48)\n\n\fAn important ingredient we have used to get the contribution (48) of the QSE is the relation (41), derived in the quenched case. In Ref. [15], the results obtained in the unquenched\ncase are quite different: the exponential form of D remains the same, but now D1 is small\nenough to be neglected. This approximation leads us, after the same calculations as before,\nto\n\u2206m2 = \u2212\n\n3a\n\u03b7(\u01eb).\n\u03c0\n\n(49)\n\nThe two formulas (48) and (49) only differ by a constant factor: 4 in the quenched case, 3\nin the unquenched one. Since this factor does not seem to be presently known with a great\naccuracy, we will finally use the following expression for the quark self energy\n\u2206m2 = \u2212\n\nfa\n\u03b7(m/\u03b4),\n\u03c0\n\n(50)\n\nwith f \u2208 [3, 4] and \u03b4 \u2208 [1.0, 1.3] GeV.\nB.\n\nInsertion of QSE in effective meson models\n\nIn the previous section, we showed how the QSE contribution acts as a shift of the squared\nmass of the quarks. We have now to insert this new term in the models we described in\nSecs. II and III. If we make the substitution m2i \u2192 m2i + \u2206m2i in the Hamiltonian (2), we\nfind\nH \u2192 H + \u2206HQSE ,\nwhere\n\u2206HQSE =\n\n2\nX\n\u2206m2\ni\n\ni=1\n\n2\u03bci\n\n(51)\n\n2\n\nf a X \u03b7(mi /\u03b4)\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03c0 i=1 2\u03bci\n\n(52)\n\nEquation (52) is the total contribution of the QSE to the RS Hamiltonian. This term has\nto be considered as a perturbation of the original Hamiltonian, and thus one has not to give\nmuch sense to the fact that for light quarks the total mass m2 + \u2206m2 is negative [8]. Since\nthe QSE is a perturbation of the Hamiltonian, it has not to be included in the elimination of\nthe auxiliary field \u03bc. To take into account the QSE in the RFTM, we suggest the following\nprocedure, inspired from Ref. [8]:\n1. To find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the RFTM Hamiltonian.\n2. To compute the mean value h\u03bc0 i of the extremal field \u03bc0 with the eigenfunctions.\n13\n\n\f3. To add to each eigenvalue the corresponding QSE contribution (52) which reads, in\nthe symmetrical case,\n\u2206MQSE = \u2212\n\nf a \u03b7(m/\u03b4)\n.\n\u03c0 h\u03bc0 i\n\n(53)\n\nThe problem is to choose the value \u03bc0 of the extremal field. Within the PFT, this value\nis given by Eq. (15), and the resulting QSE correction is given by\nPFT\n\u2206MQSE\n=\u2212\n\nf a \u03b7(m/\u03b4)\np\n,\n\u03c0 h p~ 2 + m2 i\n\n(54)\n\nas it is done in Ref. [11]. On the other hand, if the equations of the RFTM are not treated\nin perturbation, it seems natural to take Wr \u03b3\u22a5 for \u03bc0 (see Sec. II). Within this framework,\nthe QSE contribution is expected to be given by\nRFT\n\u2206MQSE\n=\u2212\n\nf a \u03b7(m/\u03b4)\n.\n\u03c0 hWr \u03b3\u22a5 i\n\n(55)\n\nActually, we have to replace Wr \u03b3\u22a5 by {Wr , \u03b3\u22a5 } /2 in order to keep the operator hermitian.\nWe can expect that both procedures will lead to different results, as in the case of the\ncontribution of the string as a perturbation (see Sec. III).\n\nC.\n\nRegge trajectories\n\nAs mentioned in Ref. [8], the QSE correction preserves the Regge trajectories. We can\nqualitatively understand this thanks to the mass formula (34), to which we add the QSE\ncontribution (52). We have\nM A (\u03bc0 ) = 4\u03bc0 \u2212\n\nal(l + 1) f a \u03b7(m/\u03b4)\n\u2212\n.\n16\u03bc30\n\u03c0\n\u03bc0\n\n(56)\n\nFor large angular momentum, \u03bc0 becomes large. Keeping only the dominant terms, we find\nthe approximate mass formula\nM A (\u03bc0 )\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2248 16\u03bc20 \u2212 8\n\nfa\n\u03b7(m/\u03b4).\n\u03c0\n\n(57)\n\nIt appears that the Regge trajectories are preserved, since the QSE only causes a global\nshift of the squared masses and preserves the dominant 16\u03bc20 term, which grows like l. This\nis particularly clear when n = 0 (see Eq. (36)).\n\n14\n\n\fVII.\n\nADDING THE QSE\n\nIn this section, we compute numerically the contributions of the QSE for both the RFTM\nand the PFTM. We will focus on the massless case, for which we expect the largest effect\nsince \u03b7(0) = 1 and the extremal field \u03bc0 is minimal. In this special case, we are able to\nperform a universal analysis of our results, since the meson mass are then just scaled by\n\u221a\nthe factor a. We will use in this section f = 3.0, which is the value computed in the\nunquenched case.\n\nFIG. 2: Main : Regge trajectories for n = 0 with (circle) and without (triangle) QSE, computed\nwith the RFTM. Small box: Same Regge trajectories computed with the PFTM. Lines are used\nto guide the eyes.\n\nWe noticed in Sec. VI C that adding the QSE contribution did not destroy the Regge\ntrajectories and the Regge slope. This result was obtained using a mass formula, itself an\napproximation of the PFTM. Since we are able to numerically solve the RFTM without\nmaking approximations [10], we can directly study the influence of the QSE correction on\nthe Regge trajectories. The main graph of Fig. 2 immediately shows the negative shift\nof the squared masses when the QSE is added, as expected. If the linearity of the Regge\ntrajectories is well preserved with the RFTM, the Regge slope is not. In this figure, \u03b2 is\nthe Regge slope with QSE and \u03b1 is the corresponding one without QSE. Both are rather\ndifferent, and we obtain \u03b2/\u03b1 = 0.88. This diminution of the slope is caused by the QSE\nterm (55). The small box shows that when one is working with the PFTM and the QSE\n\n15\n\n\fterm (54), as it is the case in [11], the Regge slope is not affected, or a very little bit. We\nfind indeed \u03b1 = 7.00 and \u03b2 = 6.95.\n\nFIG. 3: QSE contributions, for n = 0, versus l. The QSE contributions in the RFTM (filled circle)\nand with the PFTM (open circle) are computed for different quark masses. Note that when m 6= 0,\nthe scaled results are not independent of a, which is taken here equal to 0.19 GeV2 .\n\nWe have now to understand why the QSE affects the Regge slope in the RFTM and not\nin the PFTM. Fig. 3 illustrates the differences between the QSE contributions (54) and (55).\nWhen l = 0 both contributions are equal since the PFTM and the RFTM reduce to the same\nspinless Salpeter equation. In the massless case, the two contributions considerably differ\nfor l 6= 0. The QSE coming from the RFTM is always the smaller one, and this causes the\nRegge slope to be smaller when one solves the RFTM. As expected, the difference between\nthe two contributions decreases when the quark mass increases. With a large quark mass,\nboth RFTM and PFTM have a common non relativistic limit (when the approximation\nv\u22a5 \u226a 1 is the most justified). The conclusion to draw from Fig. 3 is that hWr \u03b3\u22a5 i is not\np\neven approximately equal to h p~ 2 + m2 i for light quarks. Moreover, the second expression\n\nleads to a QSE term which preserves the Regge slope, while the first one does not. We show\n\nin Fig. 4 the effect of adding to the RFTM solutions a \"theoretically justified\" QSE term\n(55) and a \"PFTM-like\" one (54). As expected, the contribution (54) causes no diminution\nof the Regge slope.\n\n16\n\n\fFIG. 4: Regge trajectories, with n = 0, for the genuine RFTM (filled circle), the RFTM with\nRFT (open circle) and with a QSE term inspired by the\na theoretically expected QSE term \u2206MQSE\nPFT (triangle).\nPFTM \u2206MQSE\n\nVIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DATA\n\nSince the RFTM includes neither the spin (S) nor the isospin (I) of the mesons, the\nexperimental data we will try to reproduce here are the spin and isospin averaged masses,\ndenoted Mav . These are given by [17]\nP\nI,J (2I + 1)(2J + 1)MI,J\nMav = P\n,\nI,J (2I + 1)(2J + 1)\n\n(58)\n\n~ +S\n~ and MI,J are different masses of the states with the same orbital angular\nwith J~ = L\n\nmomentum l. The first three columns of Table IV show the experimental data concerning\nnn\u0304 (n means u or d) states used to compute the spin-isospin averaged masses. These data\nare taken from Ref. [18].\nRealistic masses cannot be computed with the genuine flux tube Hamiltonian (10b). It\n< 0.2 GeV, but the absolute values of the\ncan indeed give the right Regge slope with a \u223c\nmasses are always too high. An attractive Coulomb potential, simulating the one-gluon\nexchange process, must be added\nV (r) = \u2212\n\n4 \u03b1S\n,\n3 r\n\n(59)\n\nwhere \u03b1S is the strong coupling constant. Theoretical arguments as well as lattice calculations agree with a value \u03b1S \u2264 0.4 [19]. However, even such a Coulomb term does not shift\n17\n\n\fthe masses enough to reproduce the data (see for example Ref. [7]), except if unrealistic too\nhigh values are chosen for \u03b1S . This means that other contributions coming from neglected\nphysical mechanisms are still needed. The QSE seems to be an interesting one, because its\ncontribution to the mass is negative, and rather large. This should allow to reproduce the\nexperimental data with an acceptable value for the Coulomb term.\nTABLE III: Two sets of possible physical parameters.\nType 1\n\nType 2\n\na (GeV2 )\n\n0.245\n\n0.195\n\nmn (GeV)\n\n0.0\n\n0.073\n\n\u03b1S\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nf\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n\u03b4 (GeV)\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\nRFT\n\u2206MQSE\n\nPFT\n\u2206MQSE\n\nQSE term\n\nIn Table III, we give the two sets of parameters we use to compute the masses of some nn\u0304\nstates. Both have the same value of f , \u03b4 and \u03b1S but differ for the other parameters. In the\ntype 1, we make the usual choice mn = 0 and take formula (55) as QSE term. This is the\ncontribution that one can theoretically expect. As we have seen that it causes a diminution\nof the Regge slope, we have to take a = 0.245 GeV2 in order to obtain a final slope in\nagreement with the experiment. Choosing a = 0.2 GeV2 is no longer possible as it is the\ncase with the PFTM [11]. This is the unconventional aspect of type 1 set of parameters.\nOn the other side, with the type 2 set, it is possible to keep for a the standard value, about\n0.2 GeV2 . The price to pay is to take formula (54) as QSE term, an only \"empirically\"\njustified choice, and to give a small mass to the quark n. The comparison between the\nexperimental averaged masses and our results is given in Table IV. We see that both types\nlead to masses close to the spin-isospin averaged ones, our results being located inside the\nerror bar in almost every case.\n\n18\n\n\fTABLE IV: Comparison between the spin averaged masses Mav of the nn\u0304 states and the results\nof the RFTM plus a QSE term.

The equivalence between\nthis phenomenological model and the more QCD based rotating string Hamiltonian is used\nas a guide to perform the calculations.\nThe equations defining the relativistic flux tube model being rather complicated to solve,\nit seems interesting to treat the flux tube contribution as a perturbation. Two procedures\nhave been studied: To eliminate firstly the auxiliary field from the rotating string Hamiltonian, or to make firstly the approximation of small transverse velocities in the rotating\nstring Hamiltonian. We arrived in Sec. III at two non equivalent terms for the flux tube\n19\n\n\fcorrection: the first one, obtained in the auxiliary field formalism, was already known [11],\nand the second, obtained directly from the relativistic flux tube equations, is a new one.\nThe results of both contributions are quite similar, but we showed in Sec. V that the first\napproach is globally the best one.\nStarting from the rotating string Hamiltonian and considering the auxiliary field associated with the quark mass \u03bc as a simple number, an approximate but analytical mass\nformula is established. It enables to understand at least qualitatively why the quark self\nenergy preserves the linearity of the Regge trajectories and decreases the squared masses by\na constant quantity (see Secs. IV and VI C).\nThe addition of the quark self energy to the relativistic flux tube model (Sec. VII) preserves the linearity of the Regge trajectories. But, for massless quarks, the Regge slope is\nsmaller by a factor 0.88 with the quark self energy than without it (this value tends toward\nunity when the quark masses increase). This effect does not exist when one works within the\nframework of a perturbation theory, in which the relativistic flux tube Hamiltonian reduces\nto a spinless Salpeter Hamiltonian. It is due to the fact that different extremal values of the\np\nfield \u03bc are found, p~ 2 + m2 or Wr \u03b3\u22a5 , considering the perturbation scheme or not.\n\nIn the framework of the relativistic flux tube model, it is possible to reproduce the\n\nexperimental data with the theoretically expected quark self energy term (\u03bc = Wr \u03b3\u22a5 ) and\nan realistic Coulomb term, if larger value than usual, 0.245 GeV2 , is chosen for the string\ntension a. It is possible to keep the well known value a = 0.2 GeV2 by using a quark self\np\nenergy term coming from a perturbation approach (\u03bc = p~ 2 + m2 ). This leads us to two\npossible conclusions. Within the relativistic flux tube model:\n\n\u2022 It is necessary to use a quark self energy term in which the extremal field \u03bc is given\np\nby p~ 2 + m2 in order to keep a value of the string tension around 0.2 GeV2 .\n\n\u2022 It is necessary to use a quark self energy term in which the extremal field \u03bc is given by\nWr \u03b3\u22a5 , the natural value associated with the relativistic flux tube model; But another\nphysical mechanism has to be taken into account in order to keep a value of the string\ntension around 0.2 GeV2 .\nIt seems hard to justify the first proposal by any theoretical argument. The mentioned new\nmechanism could be due to retardation effects or deviations from the straight line for the\nflux tube. Such a work is in progress.\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nC. S.
