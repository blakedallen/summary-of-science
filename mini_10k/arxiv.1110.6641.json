On the one\nhand, the simple fact that particles cannot avoid each other means that the nature of quantum\ndynamics is complicated in one dimension. The inevitability of particle interactions means that all\nexcitations are collective ones. In particular, the quasi-free excitations of Fermi liquids in higher\ndimensions are replaced by the non-perturbative excitations described at low energies by the theory\nof Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in one dimension. On the other hand, the tools for dealing with nonperturbative systems are far more sophisticated for one dimension than for higher dimensions. For\nthe class of systems that are quantum integrable, the mathematical toolbox is particularly full.\nThe most studied interacting, one-dimensional quantum integrable system is the Heisenberg, or\nXXZ, quantum spin chain [2, 3]\nHXXZ = \u2212\n\nN\nJX x x\ny\nz\n(\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 + \u03c3iy \u03c3i+1\n\u2212 \u2206\u03c3iz \u03c3i+1\n)\n4\ni=1\n\n1\n\n(1.1)\n\n\fwith \u2206 = cos(\u03c0/(\u03be + 1)). This model has two nice properties: many exact non-perturbative results\nexist for both finite and infinite N (see for example [4, 5] and the many references they contain); and\nit is experimentally realised. When J > 0, the XXZ chain has a massive antiferromagnetic phase\nfor \u2206 > 1 and is realised for example by CsCoCl3 [6]. When |\u2206| \u2264 1 the model has a massless\ndisordered phase and has been realised experimentally by frustrated spin ladder systems [7, 8, 9] and,\nvery recently, has become in principle accessible using optical lattices [10]-[14].\nIn paper [15], we have considered the N \u2192 \u221e limit of the Hamiltonian (1.1) in the massless phase\nwith 0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 1 (the change in gauge from HXXZ to the Hamiltonian H considered in [15] is given\nin Section 4 of the current paper). In this phase, the system is a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid [16, 17]\nwhose fundamental particles are 'spinons': spin-1/2 excitations that can be viewed as domain walls\ndressed with quantum fluctuations [18]. When \u2206 = 0 these excitations are non-interacting and are\ndescribed by free fermions. Away from \u2206 = 0 the spinons are shaped by the interactions in the bulk,\nand these interactions can be probed by determining how spinons contribute to correlation functions.\nThe correlation function we have considered in detail in [15] is the longitudinal structure factor (LSF)\nZ \u221e\nX\ndtei\u03c9t hvac|Sjz (t)S0z (0)|vaci\n(1.2)\nS zz (k, \u03c9) =\ne\u2212ikj\nj\u2208Z\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere S z = 12 \u03c3 z . The LSF can be measured directly in neutron scattering experiments (see [19] and\nreferences therein). S zz (k, \u03c9) can be computed by resolving the identity in terms of a complete set of\nP\nspinon states I =\n|\u03b1ih\u03b1| and inserting into (1.2) to give the spectral decomposition\n\u03b1\n\nS zz (k, w) =\n\nX\n\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03b4(k \u2212 K(\u03b1))\u03b4(w \u2212 W (\u03b1) |hvac|S0z |\u03b1i|2 ,\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere K(\u03b1) and W (\u03b1) are the momentum and energy of the state |\u03b1i. In our paper [15], we have\npresented the result for the exact two-spinon contribution to this sum and shown that this contribution\nis a highly accurate truncation, saturating two independent sum rules to around 99% at \u2206 = 0.5.\nThe main purpose of the current paper is to explain the derivation of the results presented in brief\nin [15]. In particular, we show how the relevant two-spinon form factors hvac|S0z |\u03b1i are obtained for\nthe massless phase of the XXZ model. The general method that we follow to obtain massless XXZ\nform-factors is usually called the vertex operator approach (VOA). The VOA for the antiferromagnetic\nXXZ model is described in detail in [20], where the representation theory of the quantum affine algebra\nb 2 ) plays an essential role. This theoretical framework has been exploited to offer results on\nUq (sl\ndynamical correlation functions of the Heisenberg chain both at the isotropic antiferromagnetic point,\nwhere two [21, 22] and four-spinon [23, 24] contributions have been obtained, and for the gapped\nantiferromagnet, where two-spinon contributions to the transverse correlator were given [25, 26]. In\norder to extend this approach to deal with the massless regime we follow the strategy proposed in\n[27]: we use the VOA for the XYZ spin chain in the principal regime, map it to the XYZ disordered\nregime, and then take a massless limit to the XXZ model.\nThe XYZ model Hamiltonian is given by\n1X\ny\nx\nz\nHXY Z = \u2212\n(Jx \u03c3ix \u03c3i+1\n+ Jy \u03c3iy \u03c3i+1\n+ Jz \u03c3iz \u03c3i+1\n).\n(1.3)\n4\ni\u2208Z\n\nb 2 ) in the XXZ model is taken\nThe VOA for the XYZ model was developed in [28, 29]. The role of Uq (sl\nb 2 ) [30, 31, 32].\nin the more general XYZ case by the elliptic quantum group of vertex type Aq,p (sl\n2\n\n\fThe VOA is directly valid in the principal regime of the XYZ model for which |Jy | \u2264 Jx \u2264 \u2212Jz .\nHowever, as demonstrated in [33], is is possible to map the principal regime to any other region in\nthe phase diagram of the XYZ model. In particular, we can map to the disordered region for which\ndisord = G H princ G\u2020 , where\n|Jz | \u2264 Jy \u2264 Jx . A transformation which achieves this is HXY\nZ\nXY Z\n!\n!\n1\n\u22121 i 1\n1 i\n, U1 = \u221a\n.\n(1.4)\nG = * * * \u2297 U1 \u2297 U0 \u2297 U1 \u2297 U0 \u2297 * * * , U0 = \u221a\n2 i \u22121\n2 \u22121 i\nIn this way, it is possible to use the VOA results in the principal regime in order to find form-factors in\nthe disordered region. It remains only to take the limit Jx \u2192 Jy limit, in order to obtain form-factors\nfor the massless XXZ model.\nHowever, things are not quite so simple: while it is true that the VOA to the XYZ model parallels that of the XXZ model, it does differ in one important respect. The explicit multiple-integral\nexpressions for form-factors in the XXZ case are obtained by using a Bosonization technique - more\nb 2 ). The problem is that such a\nprecisely a free-field-representation of the quantum affine algebra Uq (sl\nb 2 ) relevant to\nfree-field representation has not yet been found for the quantum elliptic algebra Aq,p (sl\nthe XYZ model. The reason for this technical problem is ultimately linked to the absence of charge\nconservation around a vertex in the 8-vertex model associated with the XYZ chain.\nThis problem has been considered before in the literature, and there are two ways to get around\nit. The first approach involves mapping the XYZ model to a solid-on-solid (SOS) model, for which a\nfree-field realisation does exist (and for which the relevant algebraic structure is the elliptic quantum\nb 2 )[34, 35, 36]). This was the method developed and used by Lashkevich and\ngroup of face type Uq,p (sl\nPugai to obtain expressions for both form-factors and correlation functions in the principal regime\nXYZ model [37, 38]. The method was extended to higher spin analogues of the XYZ model in [39].\nThe second approach is applicable specifically to the massless XXZ model; the idea here is to derive\nand solve a difference equation (a deformed KZ-equation) for correlation functions from the analogous\nequation for the XYZ model [40], or to construct a field realisation only after having already mapped\nto the disordered regime and taken the massless limit [27].\nIn this paper, we take the first approach, the main reason being that simplified expressions for\nthe resulting XYZ two-particle form-factors mapped to the disordered regime are already present in\nthe literature [41]. Our contribution is to take the appropriate massless XXZ scaling limit of these\nexisting results, and to use them to compute the exact two-particle contribution to the longitudinal\nstructure factor.\nIn Section 2 of this paper, we describe the key components of the VOA to the XYZ model in\nthe principal regime, the map to the disordered regime, and the limit from the existing disorderedregime XYZ form-factor results to our new massless XXZ form-factor expressions. In Section 3, we\ngive the derivation of expression (3.4) for the two-spinon contribution to the longitudinal structure\nfactor S zz (k, w). This was the key result quoted in the earlier paper [15]. In Section 4, we present a\ndetailed quantitative analysis of the structure factor, an analytic derivation of the asymptotic threshold\nbehaviour close to the upper and lower w limits of the two-particle (w, k) continuum, and an analysis\nof the region of the (w, k) band over which this threshold behaviour is a good practical approximation\nfor different \u2206 values. We present some concluding remarks in Section 5. Finally, in Appendices A\nand B, we give the definitions and required properties of elliptic functions, and present an alternative\nderivation of the mapping of principal form factors to disordered ones.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nFrom XYZ to Massless XXZ\n\nA general multiple-integral expression for principal regime XYZ form-factors can be constructed by\nfollowing the approach of [37, 38]. The case of the form-factor of the operator \u03c3 z is considered in detail\nin the paper [38], and the author demonstrates a technique that enables him to obtain an expression\nfor this form-factor which involves no integrals. This approach is extended to \u03c3 x and \u03c3 y form-factors\nby Lukyanov and Terras in [41]. Using the mapping mentioned in the previous section these authors\npresent results directly in the disordered region of the XYZ model. In this section, we review these\nresults and take the appropriate scaling limit to the massless XXZ model. This limit is different to\nthe sine-Gordon limit considered in [41].\n\n2.1\n\nThe XYZ model in the principal regime\n\nThe XYZ Hamiltonian is derived from the 8-vertex model elliptic R matrix [33] given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na(u)\nd(u)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nb(u) c(u)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nR(u) = \u03c1(u) \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nc(u) b(u)\nd(u)\na(u)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwith\na(u) = snh(\u03bb(1 \u2212 u)), b(u) = snh(\u03bbu), c(u) = snh(\u03bb), d(u) = ksnh(\u03bb(1 \u2212 u))snh(\u03bbu)snh(\u03bb).\nHere snh(u) = \u2212isn(iu) is the Jacobi elliptic function with modulus k. The definitions, relations\nbetween and required properties of all elliptic functions used in this paper can be found in Appendix\nA. Let K, K 0 be the corresponding complete elliptic integrals given in Appendix A. We use the variables\nx2r = e\u2212\n\n\u03c0K 0\nK\n\n,\n\n\u03c0\u03bb\n\nx = e\u2212 2K ,\n\n\u03b6 = xu ,\n4\u03c0K\n\n\u03bb\nfrom which definition it follows that \u03bb = K 0 /r. We also define p = e\u2212 K 0 and \u03b4 = K\n, and sometimes\nuse \u03be = r \u2212 1 when connecting to the results of [41]. The principal regime is given by 0 < xr < x <\n\u03b6 < 1.

This approach was then extended to the\nprincipal regime XYZ model in [28]-[32]. The essence of the approach is to identify the transfer matrix,\nthe space on which it acts, and local operators in terms of the representation theory of the underlying\n\u0001\nb 2 ; in the XYZ\nsymmetry algebra. In the XXZ case, this algebra is the quantum affine algebra Uq sl\nb 2 ) (beware that the (q, p) indicated in the name Aq,p (sl\nb 2 ) do not\ncase it is the elliptic algebra Aq,p (sl\n2r\ncorrespond directly to the notation of the current paper - in fact we have (q, p) = (\u2212x, x )). In this\nsection and Appendix B, we give a brief outline of the key features of the approach relevant to the\npresent work. We refer the interested reader to the original articles cited above and [39] for further\ndetails.\nThe lattice transfer matrix of the infinite-size principal-regime XYZ model acts on the infinite\ntensor product space * * * \u2297 V \u2297 V \u2297 V \u2297 V \u2297 * * * with antiferromagnetic boundary conditions at plus\nand minus infinity. Let us choose to label the position of our spin-chain sites as * * * , 2, 1, 0, \u22121, \u22122, * * * .\n5\n\n\fThen the two antiferromagnetic boundary conditions we consider are labelled by j = 0 or j = 1 and\ncorrespond to considering only those states which have the spin at site i, denote \u03b5(i), restricted to\n\u03b5\u0304(j) (i) = (\u22121)i+j+1 for |i| >> 0. More precisely, we introduce the space of states H(j) (j = 0, 1) as a\nhalf of the infinite tensor space with the antiferromagnetic boundary condition j. Namely\nn\no\nH(j) := SpanC * * * \u2297 v\u03b5(1) \u2297 v\u03b5(0) | \u03b5(i) = \u00b1, \u03b5(i) = \u03b5\u0304 (j) (i) for i \u001d 0 ,\n(2.4)\n!\n1\n, v\u2212 =\n0\n\n!\n0\nwhere v+ =\n.

This\nlocal operator is realised as an operator on H(j) in the vertex operator approach as\n(j,1\u2212j)\n\nO(E\u03b5\u03b50 )(j) = \u03a6\u2212\u03b5\n\n(1\u2212j,j)\n\n(u \u2212 1)\u03a6\u03b50\n\n(u)\n\nu=0\n\n.\n\n(2.9)\n\nThen the spin operator \u03c3 x for example is realised as O(\u03c3 x )(j) = O(E+\u2212 )(j) + O(E\u2212+ )(j) .\nThe vacuum eigenvector of the transfer matrix T (u) is denoted by |vac; pri(j) \u2208 F (j) and defined\nby\nT (u)|vac; pri(j) = |vac; pri(1\u2212j) .\n\n6\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fThis eigenvector1 has a very simple form in the vertex operator picture, and is constructed in terms\nof a certain grading operator H (j) that acts on H(j) . More precisely, we define H (j) = \u2212 12 \u03c1 + 4j , where\n\u03c1 = \u039b0 + \u039b1 , and identify\n|vac; pri(j) =\n\n1\n(Z (j) )\n\n(j)\n\n1\n2\n\nx2H ,\n\nwhere we are regarding F (j) ' End(H(j) ).

Here the inner product of two elements f, g \u2208\nEnd(H(j) ) is defined by (f, g) = TrH(j) (f \u25e6 g). We denote a vector in F (j) = H(j) \u2297 H\u2217(j) by a ket\nvector in this section, but it should be understood that it is identified with an operator in End(H(j) )\nwhenever one considers an action of the vertex operators on it. In what follows, we refer to arguments\nbased on the identification F (j) \u223c\n= End(H(j) ) as the 'vertex operator picture'.\nThe reader may at this point be thinking that the vertex operator approach is wholly algebraic and\nformal, but in fact H (j) , \u03a6\u03b5 (u) and Z (j) have a direct lattice interpretation in terms of the 8-vertex\nmodel: the operator H (j) is identified with Baxter's corner-transfer-matrix Hamiltonian, \u03a6\u03b5 (u) with\nthe half-transfer matrix, and Z (j) with the partition function. In fact, it was Baxter's observation [33]\nthat it it possible to express the partition function in terms of the corner-transfer-matrix Hamiltonian\nas in Equation (2.12), and the subsequent observation that this partition function was related to\nb 2 principal character, that were the starting points for the development of the vertex operator\nthe sl\napproach.\nIn order to construct other eigenstates of the operator (2.7) it is necessary to introduce a new 'type\nII' vertex operator \u03a8\u2217(1\u2212j,j) (u), defined as the map\n\u03a8\u2217(1\u2212j,j) (u) : Vu \u2297 H(j) \u2212\u2192 H(1\u2212j) ,\n\u2217(1\u2212j,j)\n\nwith components \u03a8\u00b1\n\n(u) specified by\n\u03a8\u2217(1\u2212j,j)\n(u) = \u03a8\u2217(1\u2212j,j) (u) (v\u03b5 \u2297 *) .\n\u03b5\n\nThe full list of properties of both type I and type II vertex operators can be found in [38].

More precisely, the\n\u2217(1\u2212j,j)\ntype II vertex operators \u03a8\u03b5\n(u) are identified with the creation operators of quasi-particle (spinon)\nexcitations with rapidity \u03b8 = \u2212i\u03c0u and spin \u03b5.

Noting the duplication (2.23), we have a new vacuum vector |vaci(j) in Fdis\nexpressed in two ways as\n|vaci(j) = Gj+` |vac; pri(1\u2212`)\nwith ` = 0, 1.\n\n2.4\n\nThe massless XXZ limit\n\nThe massless XXZ Hamiltonian is obtained by taking the limit x \u2192 1 (K \u2192 +\u221e) of the disordered\ndis\nHamiltonian HXY\nZ while keep r fixed. This corresponds to the following limits of the various elliptic\nparameters:\nK0 \u2192\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n, k \u2192 1, k 0 \u2192 0, \u03b4 \u2192 0+ , \u03bb \u2192 .\n2\n2r\n\nCorresponding to this limit, we have\nJx \u2192 J,\nDefining \u2206 = cos\n\n\u03c0\nr\n\n\u0001\n\nJy \u2192 J cos\n\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\nr\n\n,\n\nJz \u2192 \u2212J.\n\n, we then have\ndis\nHXY\nZ \u2192\u2212\n\nJX x x\ny\nz\n(\u03c3i \u03c3i+1 + \u03c3iy \u03c3i+1\n\u2212 \u2206\u03c3iz \u03c3i+1\n),\n4\ni\u2208Z\n\nwhich is the Hamiltonian of the massless XXZ model.\nIn order to obtain the dispersion relation for the massless XXZ model, let us set \u03b8+ = \u03b2 and\nr\n\u2212 \u03c0\u03b4\n4\n\u03b8\u2212 = \u03b2 \u2212 2\u03c0\n.

However, as we shall discuss in Section 3, spinons come only in pairs, and\nright-moving spinons are alone sufficient to span the complete Hilbert space of the quantum spin chain.\n2.4.1\n\nThe sine-Gordon Limit\n\nIn [41], the sine-Gordon theory is discussed by taking a similar x \u2192 1 scaling limit of the XYZ\nmodel. It is interesting to compare our massless XXZ limit with this relativistic field theory limit.\nThe approach of [41] involves shifting the rapidity in a different way: as \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0\u03b4 (we here use \u03b8\nto indicate the parameter denoted by \u03b8 in [41]). Then, with a slightly different normalisation of the\nHamiltonian, the momentum p and the excitation energy \u03b5 of the quantised soliton are given in [41]\nby\n\u0011\n\u0010\nr\ni\u03b8\n, p4\n\u03b84 41 + 2\u03c0\n\u0010\n\u0011,\neip(\u03b8) = \u03c4 (\u2212i\u03b8/\u03c0 + i/\u03b4) =\nr\ni\u03b8\n\u03b84 14 \u2212 2\u03c0\n, p4\n\u03b5(\u03b8) =\n\n\u2202\np(\u03b8).\n\u2202\u03b8\n\nThen in the same scaling limit x \u2192 1 as above together with the limit that the lattice spacing \u000f \u2192 0,\nthe dispersion relation for massive relativistic particles is given in [41] as\np(\u03b8)\n\u000f\n\u03b5(\u03b8)\nlim\n\u000f\n\nlim\n\n= M sinh \u03b8,\n= M cosh \u03b8,\n\n11\n\n\fwhere the mass M is given by\n\u03c0\n\n2e\u2212 \u03b4\nM = lim\n.\n\u000f\nThis sine-Gordon limit is different to our massless XXZ limit and was used in [41] in order to connect\nlattice and field theory operators.\n\n2.5\n\nForm factors in the disordered regime\n\nIn the same way that vacuum vectors in the disordered regime were constructed in Section 1.3, excited\ndis\nstates of HXY\nZ are given by\n(1\u2212`)\n\n(j)\n\n|\u03b81 , * * * , \u03b82n i\u03b51 ,*** ,\u03b52n = Gj+` |\u03b81 , * * * , \u03b82n ; pri\u03b51 ,*** ,\u03b52n\n(j)\n\nin Fdis with ` = 0, 1.

Furthermore, this integral was there\nperformed explicitly in the case when the local operator was \u03c3 z - see (3.14)-(3.16) of [38]. This same\nmethod was then used to compute the integrals associated with the other Pauli operators in [41] and\na summary of all cases can be found in Appendix A of [41] (where the results are presented directly\nin the disordered regime).

Note also that the apparent \u03c0\u03b4 shifts in the arguments of the\nfunctions f relative to [41] are again due to the fact that that our \u03b8 and the corresponding symbol\n12\n\n\fin [41], which we here denote \u03b8, are related by \u03b8 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0\u03b4 .

Note however, that there is a slight but important difference to [20]. In considering XXZ\nsingle spinons in Section 2.2, we have characterised right-moving spinons as having momentum in the\nrange (0, \u03c0) and left-moving spinons as having momentum in the range (\u2212\u03c0, 0). In (3.1) however, we\nonly include even spinon states consisting of right-moving spinons. The reason for this are two-fold:\nfirstly, that right-left moving pairs are simply absent from the Bethe Ansatz states, and secondly that\na right-right pair already spans the entire (0, 2\u03c0) Brillouin zone - to include the left-left pair would\nbe to double count. This point is discussed in some detail in [26] for the massive antiferromagnetic\nphase of the XXZ model. Independent numerical justification that we have made the correct choice\nof normalisation is given by the sum rule calculations in Section 4.\nIn writing (1.2) we have not specified to which vacuum we are referring. However, the result is\nthe same whether we choose to use |vaci(0) , |vaci(1) or the linear combinations |vaci\u00b1 = \u221a12 (|vaci(0) \u00b1\n|vaci(1) ) considered in [41].

The two-spinon part of the LSF is given by Equation (3.4) in which the parameter\n\u03b2(k, \u03c9) =: 2\u03c0\u03c1(k, \u03c9) is obtained from the constraint\nv\nu 2\n2 (k)\nu \u03c92,u (k) \u2212 \u03c92,l\ncosh(\u03c0\u03c1(k, \u03c9)) = t\n(4.2)\n2 (k) .\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c92,l\n\n4.1\n\nFull Brillouin zone\n\nIn Figures 1 and 2, we present plots of the two-spinon longitudinal structure factor for different\nvalues of anisotropy, starting at the XX limit and going up to the isotropic antiferromagnetic point\n\u2206 = 1. All plots cover a full Brillouin zone and clearly show the continuum over which the two-spinon\ncorrelation is non-vanishing. This continuum in the k-\u03c9 plane is located between the lower and upper\nboundaries (3.3). In fact, for zero magnetic field, the full LSF vanishes beneath the lower boundary,\ni.e., for \u03c9 < \u03c92,l (k). All 2, 4, 6, ... spinon states share the line \u03c9 = \u03c92,l (k) as their lower boundary, and\nthe LSF is strictly positive for all \u03c9 > \u03c92,l (k). Above the upper two-spinon boundary \u03c9 > \u03c92,u (k),\nthe two-spinon contribution of course vanishes, but higher-spinon states can contribute.\nStarting at small \u2206, the top left panel of Figure 1 clearly illustrates the fact that the LSF diverges\nat the upper boundary (we will quantify all threshold behaviour in Section 4.5), and tends to a\nconstant at the lower one. This is easily understood [46, 47] by mapping to a system of free fermions\nusing the Jordan-Wigner transformation, under which the S z operator becomes a fermionic density\noperator. Since the fermionic density operator in Fourier space takes the form of a convolution product\nP \u2020\nof creation-annihilation operators, \u03c1k = q \u03c8k+q\n\u03c8k , and since the ground state is a simple Fermi sea\nof the Jordan-Wigner fermions, all form factors of the S z operator are energy independent, and vanish\nfor all but the two-spinon states. The LSF is thus simply a representation of the two-spinon density\n15\n\n\fFigure 1: Two-spinon part of the longitudinal structure factor of the infinite Heisenberg chain, for\ndifferent values of the anisotropy parameter \u2206 (see also Figure 2). For \u2206 \u2192 0, the correlation follows\nthe density of states, and has a square root singularity at the upper threshold for all values of momenta.\nof states, which has a square-root divergence at the upper threshold (see, e.g., [48] for details) and is\nconstant at the lower one.\nTurning the anisotropy up leads rapidly to the loss of the divergence at the upper threshold,\nstarting from the region k ' \u03c0, as can be seen in the top right panel of Figure 1. The presence of\na finite \u2206 is most importantly felt in the form factors: while the density of states still diverges, the\nform factors now decrease sufficiently rapidly to kill off this divergence. Once \u2206 has attained values of\naround 0.4, the remains of the divergence at the upper threshold have been completely erased for all\nvalues of momentum away from the zone boundary, and the lower threshold starts to feel the effects\nof the antiferromagnetic correlations, the peak at k = \u03c0, \u03c9 = 0 starting to develop.\nAs \u2206 is increased further (see Figure 2, the cascade of correlation weight towards the low-energy\nsector continues until the isotropic limit is attained, at which point which most of the signal is concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the lower threshold.\nThroughout this series of plots (which are presented in a uniform \u03c9 and intensity scale for convenience of comparison), the slow increase of the Fermi velocity and of the reach of the two-spinon\ncontinuum can be seen.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 2: Two-spinon part of the longitudinal structure factor of the infinite Heisenberg chain, for\ndifferent values of the anisotropy parameter \u2206 (see also Figure 2). Increasing the anisotropy shifts the\nweight progressively towards the lower boundary. The lower boundary becomes increasingly sharp as\nthe \u2206 \u2192 1 limit is approached.\n\n17\n\n\f4.2\n\nFixed momentum\n\nIn Figures 3 - 6, we provide a number of fixed-momentum cuts of the two-spinon part of the longitudinal\nstructure factor. We organise the plots in each figure by increasing anisotropy at fixed momentum.\nEach individual plot also gives the \u2206 = 0 and \u2206 = 1 curves as a reference; the effects of tuning the\nanisotropy continuously between these two values can thus be easily visualised.\nAt k = \u03c0/4, as shown in Figure 3, the two-spinon continuum is quite narrow but its position\nis steadily increasing in energy as the anisotropy is turned up, since the Fermi velocity vF (2.24) is\nsteadily increasing with increasing anisotropy. The upper-threshold singularity at \u2206 = 0 disappears\nquickly as a function of \u2206, being replaced by a square-root cusp (see the discussion in Section 4.5).\nThe singularity at the lower threshold appears immediately but takes on a significant weight only for\naround \u2206 \u223c 0.3 and above. The picture is very similar for the other momenta presented, namely\nk = \u03c0/2 (Figure 4), k = 3\u03c0/4 (Figure 5) and \u03c0 (Figure 6).\n\n4.3\n\nSum rules\n\nThe full Hilbert space of the model in the zero magnetisation sector contains many more states than\nthe simple two-spinon states we have considered. Two-spinon states in fact represent only a vanishingly\nsmall fraction of the total number of states when the system size goes to infinity. It is thus a remarkable\nfact that these simple states can carry a non-vanishing fraction of any correlation function.\nTo quantify the importance of the two-spinon contribution to the longitudinal structure factor, we\nconsider two sum rules. First of all, we use the integrated intensity\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ\ndk \u221e d\u03c9\n1\nI zz =\nS(k, \u03c9) = ,\n(4.3)\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n4\n0\n0\nobtained from the simple real space-time correlator hSjz0 =j (t = 0)Sjz (0)i = 41 . A less trivial sum\nrule comes from considering the integrated first frequency moment of the structure factor, giving the\nso-called f-sumrule (at fixed momentum) [49],\nI1zz (k)\n\nZ\n=\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0003 z \u0003\nd\u03c9\n1 \u0002\u0002\n\u03c9S(k, \u03c9) = \u2212 h H, Sqz , S\u2212q\ni = \u22122X x (1 \u2212 cos k),\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\nP\nwhere Sqz := \u221a1N j eiqj Sjz is the Fourier transform of the local magnetisation operator and X x :=\nx i is the ground state expectation value of the in-plane exchange term. The explicit value of\nhSjx Sj+1\nthe right-hand side of this identity can be obtained from the ground-state energy density e0 [50] and\n1\n\u2202\nits derivative using the Feynman-Hellman theorem, namely X x = 2J\n(1 \u2212 \u2206 \u2202\u2206\n)e0 , with\n\u0014\n\u0015Z \u221e \u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212J(\u03be + 1)\n\u03c0\ntanh t\ndt 1 \u2212\ne0 =\nsin\n.\n(4.5)\n2\u03c0\n\u03be +1 \u2212\u221e\ntanh[(\u03be + 1)t]\nThe level of saturation of the two sum rules coming from two-spinon intermediate states is inevitably anisotropy dependent. We provide the explicit values of the sum rule saturations coming\nfrom two-spinon contributions in Table 2 (for the f-sumrule, the saturation turns out to be exactly\nthe same at all momenta). Two-spinon states carry the totality of the correlation at \u2206 = 0, a result\nwhich can be understood by considering the mapping to free fermions using the Jordan-Wigner transformation mentioned previously. Two-spinon states are the only intermediate states contributing to\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 3: Fixed momentum cuts at k = \u03c0/4 of the two-spinon part of the longitudinal structure factor\nof the infinite Heisenberg chain, for different values of the anisotropy parameter \u2206.

Our results are of course\nconsistent with this fact.\nA more remarkable fact is that the subset of two-spinon states continues to play such a determinantal role in carrying the longitudinal structure factor even when the anisotropy has been turned on\nto significant values. As our results show, two-spinon states carry essentially all the correlation weight\nup to surprisingly large values of interactions \u2206 \u223c 0.8, above which four, six, ... spinon states become\nharder to neglect. This is quite surprising since, reasoning again in the fermionic language obtained\nfrom the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the interaction should be able to create multiple particle-hole\nstates quite easily, and arbitrarily complicated higher-spinon states should therefore participate in the\ncorrelation, leaving two-spinon states only negligible contribution. While true in the generic finite\nmagnetic field case, it turns out that for zero magnetic field, the available particle phase-space shrinks\nto zero, and only the hole (spinon) part can disperse. The longitudinal structure factor thus possesses\na finite two-spinon contribution, which is not true for example of the transverse structure factor.\n\u2206\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\nzz /I zz\nI2sp\n1\n0.9997\n0.9986\n0.9964\n0.9927\n0.9869\n\nzz /I zz\nI1,2sp\n1\n1\n0.9997\n0.9984\n0.9959\n0.9917\n0.9849\n\n\u2206\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n0.99\n0.999\n\nzz /I zz\nI2sp\n0.9778\n0.9637\n0.9406\n0.8980\n0.7918\n0.7494\n\nzz /I zz\nI1,2sp\n1\n0.9743\n0.9578\n0.9314\n0.8844\n0.7748\n0.7331\n\nTable 2: Sum rule saturations as a function of anisotropy: two-spinon contribution to the integrated\nintensity I zz (4.3) and first frequency moment I1zz (4.4).\n\n4.4\n\nCorrespondence with finite size results\n\nThe longitudinal structure factor can also be obtained at finite size using explicit summations over\nintermediate states, as performed in [51, 52]. At finite size (i.e., when the chain is made of N sites; we\ntake N even to ensure a non-degenerate ground state at zero field), two-spinon states in zero field are\nthose eigenstates obtained using N/2 \u2212 1 real rapidities and a single negative-parity one-string (those\nreaders unfamiliar with this nomenclature are referred to the explanations in [52]). The total number\nof such states then corresponds to the number of ways of choosing two hole quantum numbers from\nN/2 + 1 available ones, and thus equals N (N + 2)/8. We can thus, at a fixed size N , sum over the\ncontributions to (1.2) coming from these two-spinon states, and compare with our infinite-size result.\nFigure 7 presents such a comparison, done at a representative value of anisotropy \u2206 = 0.7 and\ntwo values of momentum, k = \u03c0/2 and k = \u03c0. Other values of anisotropy and momenta give qualitatively similar plots. Besides the thermodynamic limit curve obtained from plotting the two-spinon\ncontribution we have obtained, we also present the equivalent curves for three different system sizes,\nN = 256, 512 and 1024. The finite-size results must be smoothed with a gaussian, since the correlation\nfunction is then a sum of delta-function peaks split in energy by the mean energy level spacing. This\nsmoothing can be sharpened at increasing system size, and this increasing sharpness can be clearly\nseen, e.g., at the lower boundary of the k = \u03c0/2 plot. It is clear that the finite-size curves tend to the\n\n23\n\n\fFigure 7: Comparison between the two-spinon longitudinal structure factor for \u2206 = 0.7 and momentum k = \u03c0/2 (left) and k = \u03c0 (right), in the thermodynamic limit (solid curve) and at finite size.\nThe finite size results are obtained by summing exactly over the set of N (N + 2)/8 two-spinon states\nat chain length N , and are plotted after gaussian smoothing of the delta function contributions.

See main text for more details.\nIn Table 3, we provide quantitative results for the sum rule contributions for the representative\nvalue of anisotropy \u2206 = 0.7. Similarly to Table 2, we provide both the integrated intensity sum rule\ncontribution (4.3) as well as the f-sumrule one (4.4), coming from two-spinon states. The results at\nfinite size are clearly seen to tend to their infinite-size limit. For completeness, we have extrapolated\n\u221a\nthe finite-size results using data at N = 256, 512, 768 and 1024, fitting with a polynomial in 1/ N .\nWithin the accuracy of the extrapolation, these results coincide with the ones obtained from the\nanalytical form.\n\n24\n\n\f4.5\n\nThreshold behaviour\n\nThe investigation of the precise form of the longitudinal structure factor near the upper and lower\nboundaries of the two-spinon continuum, which our results render possible, is of considerable theoretical interest in view of recent developments in the general phenomenology of one-dimensional quantum\nliquids [53, 54, 55] coming from efforts to calculate dynamical correlations away from the low-energy\nlimit [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. For the special case of the longitudinal structure factor of the zero-field\ngapless XXZ antiferromagnet we are considering, which is equivalent to the density-density correlator\nof spinless interacting fermions obtained via a Jordan-Wigner transformation, the field theory predictions of [61, 62] yield a singular LSF in the vicinity of the lower/upper thresholds of the two-spinon\ncontinuum. In the vicinity of the upper threshold, for 0 < \u2206 < 1, this singularity is shown to be of the\np\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c92,u (k) \u2212 \u03c9.

In terms of the parameter \u03be, the\n\u03c0\n1\n1\nLuttinger parameter becomes K = 2 (1 + \u03be ). Our discussion here has two aims: firstly, to reproduce\nand possibly refine the determination of this threshold behaviour; secondly, to quantify its region of\nvalidity, which is very difficult to achieve within nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory.\nLet us thus consider evaluating the two-spinon part of the longitudinal structure factor in the\nvicinity of the excitation thresholds, starting from our exact representation (3.4).

For the generic 0 < \u2206 < 1 case, the obtained threshold exponents would remain unchanged\nupon the addition of these contributions, since the power series in the energy distance \u03b4\u03c9 to the\nsingularity cannot contain any logarithmic terms which could re-exponentiate into a different power\nlaw. The prefactor might however be corrected.\n4.5.3\n\nRegion of validity of threshold behaviour\n\nWe now compare the behaviour at the lower and upper thresholds with the numerical evaluation of\nexpression (3.4) in order to see over what range of frequencies these threshold formulae are valid.\nzz at fixed\nWe do this in two different ways. The first way consists in evaluating the ratio S2zz /Sthr\nzz represents the relevant threshold behaviour in equations\nmomentum as a function of \u03c9, in which Sthr\n(4.9,4.18) (the prefactors fu,l (\u03be) being obtained numerically directly from the exact representation\n(3.4)), and to find the region of \u03c9 near the singularity for which this ratio remains one within the\nrequired accuracy. The second way consists in actually fitting a plot of the exact expression (3.4) with\nthe expected threshold power law over a finite but small frequency region near the singularity, and to\nthen check over which interval in frequency this fit remains consistent. The latter method emulates\nthe kind of fitting one might do starting from approximate ab-initio numerical data for the structure\nfactor, and gives an overestimate of the region of validity. The two methods give results consistent\n\n28\n\n\fwith each other when the region of validity is at least of a few percent of the available continuum.\nOtherwise the stricter first way gives a much smaller region of validity.\nTables 4 , 5 and 6 summarise where the difference between the threshold formula and the numerics\nbecomes more than 1% and 10%, as a percentage of the numerical result, using the first criterion.\nThe entries in the final four columns of these tables show the approximate percentage of the \u03c9 range\n(\u03c9u \u2212 \u03c9l ) that the threshold behaviour is valid for (within 1% and 10%). For example, for \u2206 = 0.5\nand k = 0.125 (the first row in Table 5), the formula for the upper threshold is within 1% of the result\nfor \u223c 7% of the \u03c9 range, and within 10% of the result for \u223c 47% of the \u03c9 range.\nIt is immediately obvious that the region of validity of the lower and upper threshold behaviours\ndepends strongly on the anisotropy. For low anisotropy, the upper threshold is not fitted well, the\nlower one being better described. For intermediate anisotropy the fitting is very reasonable, and covers\na substantial range (over half) of the continuum. At high anisotropy, the lower threshold is not well\nfitted, whereas the upper one is rather well approximated. One point to notice is that the range of\ncorrespondence between the lower threshold behaviour and the exact structure factor for momenta\nat or near \u03c0 is very narrow: in this case, subleading terms correcting the theshold behaviour should\nnot be neglected (the very low percentages presented in some entries in the tables should however\nbe considered as indicative only, in view of numerical difficulties in evaluating the structure factor\nin the immediate vicinity of thresholds). On the other hand, the less sensitive second way of fitting\ngives acceptable fits over a wider range of frequencies. Plots for the structure factor accompanied by\nthe threshold fits using this second way are given for these three values of anisotropy and momentum\nvalues in Figures 8-10.\n\nk/(2\u03c0)\n\nwl\n\nwu\n\nLower\n< 1%\n\n0.125\n0.25\n0.375\n0.5\n\n0.751\n1.06\n0.751\n0\n\n0.813\n1.50\n1.96\n2.13\n\n\u223c 1%\n\u223c 1.2%\n\u223c 1.8%\n< 0.1%\n\nLower\n< 10%\n\nUpper\n< 1%\n\nUpper\n< 10%\n\n\u223c 12%\n\u223c 14%\n\u223c 20%\n\u223c 0.9%\n\n< 0.1%\n< 0.1%\n< 0.1%\n< 0.1%\n\n\u223c 0.6%\n\u223c 0.5%\n\u223c 0.4%\n\u223c 0.3%\n\nTable 4: Approximate validity of threshold results for anisotropy \u2206 = 0.1.

Our results extend to this region previous results\nfor the isotropic or gapped antiferromagnet.\nThe question of the transverse structure factor remains difficult for the methods presented here.\nIn the basis we are using, all transverse spin operator form factors vanish upon taking the gapless\nlimit, and this points to the need for a resummation over states including macroscopic numbers of\nspinons, something which goes beyond current capabilities. Extending these results to the case of a\nfinite magnetic field faces similar issues; the restriction to zero temperature is even more severe. We\nleave these questions open for the moment.\nAnother important (but now feasible) extension to our work would be to consider higher-spinon\ncontributions to the longitudinal structure factor. This was actually performed for the isotropic\nXXX antiferromagnet in the recent past [24]; one can expect that such a calculation would yield\nthe longitudinal structure factor to around 1% accuracy for any value of anisotropy in the gapless\nantiferromagnetic regime in zero field. It would also allow us to further refine the determination of\nthe threshold behaviour and of its limit of applicability. We will investigate these and other issues in\nthe future.\n\nAcknowledgements\nJ.-S.

(A.9)\n\nB\n\nDerivation of (2.25) in the Vertex Operator Picture\n\nA key observation is an identification of the type I vertex operators with the half-transfer matrices on\nthe lattice. Then applying the gauge transformations (2.21) to each R matrix constituting the halftransfer matrix, one can reach the following definition of the type I vertex operators in the disordered\nregime.\nX\n(`,1\u2212`)\n\u22121\ne (j) (u) :=\n\u03a6\n(Uj+` )\u03b5\u03b50 Gj+`+1 \u03a6\u03b50\n(u)Gj+`\n: Gj+` H(1\u2212`) \u2192 Gj+`+1 H(`) .\n(B.10)\n\u03b5;`\n\u03b50 =\u00b1\n\n34\n\n\f(j)\n\nNote that from (2.23) these are linear operators on Hdis . Accordingly, one can realise a local operator\n(j)\nas an operator on Hdis = Gj+` H(1\u2212`) by\n(j)\ne (j)\ne (j)\nO0 (E\u03b5\u03b50 )` := \u03a6\n\u2212\u03b5;1\u2212` (u \u2212 1)\u03a6\u03b50 ;` (u)\n\nu=0\n\n.\n\nThen it follows from (2.9) and (B.10) that we have the gauge transformation of the spin operators as\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n\u22121\nO0 (\u03c3 x )` = (\u2212)j+` Gj+` O(\u03c3 z )(1\u2212`) Gj+`\n,\n\n\u22121\nO0 (\u03c3 y )` = Gj+` O(\u03c3 x )(1\u2212`) Gj+`\n,\n\n\u22121\nO0 (\u03c3 z )(j) = (\u2212)j+` Gj+` O(\u03c3 y )(1\u2212`) Gj+`\n.\n\n(B.11)\n\nThis is consistent to the transformation of \u03c3 \u03b1 as a 2\u00d72 matrix: AdUj\u22121 : \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z 7\u2192 (\u22121)j \u03c3 z , \u03c3 x , (\u22121)j \u03c3 y .\nIn the vertex operator picture, the gauge transformation of the vacuum vectors |vac; pri(j) =\n(j)\n(j)\n2H\nx\n/(Z (j) )1/2 \u2208 F (j) \u223c\n= End(H(j) ) follows from the fact that x2H originates as the product of two\ncorner transfer matrices. Hence the vacuum vectors as well as other physical 2n-spinon excited states\nshould have the same transformation property as the corner transfer matrix. Therefore we identify\nnew vacuum vectors as\n|vaci(j) = Gj+`\n(j)\n\n1\n(Z (1\u2212`) )1/2\n\nx2H\n\n(1\u2212`)\n\n\u22121\nGj+`\n\n(` = 0, 1)\n\n(B.12)\n\u2217(1\u2212j,j)\n\n(j)\n\nin Fdis \u223c\n= End(Hdis ). Similarly to the type I case, the type II vertex operators \u03a8\u03b5\n(j)\nprincipal regime are mapped to linear operators on Hdis by\n\n(i\u03b8/\u03c0) in the\n\n\u22121\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b8) = Gj+`+1 \u03a8\u2217(`,1\u2212`)\n: Gj+` H(1\u2212`) \u2192 Gj+`+1 H(`) .\n\u03a8\n(i\u03b8/\u03c0)Gj+`\n\u03b5\n\u03b5;`\n\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b8) commute with the new type I vertex\nOne should note that the new type II vertex operators \u03a8\n\u03b5;`\n(j)\ne\noperators \u03a6 (u) in pairs. Namely,\n\u03b5;`\n\ne (j) (u)\u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b82 )\u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b81 ) = \u03c4 (u \u2212 i\u03b81 /\u03c0)\u03c4 (u \u2212 i\u03b82 /\u03c0)\u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b82 )\u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b81 )\u03a6\ne (j) (u).\n\u03a6\n\u03b5;`\n\u03bc2 ;1\u2212`\n\u03bc1 ;`\n\u03bc2 ;`\n\u03bc1 ;1\u2212`\n\u03b5;`\nHence we obtain the following identification of the disordered 2n-spinon states\n(j)\n\n|\u03b81 , \u03b82 * * * \u03b82n i\u03b51 ,\u03b52 ,*** ,\u03b52n\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b82n ) * * * \u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b82 )\u03a8\ne \u2217(j) (\u03b81 )|vaci(j)\n=\u03a8\n\u03b52n ;1\u2212`\n\u03b52 ;1\u2212`\n\u03b51 ;`\n= Gj+` \u03a8\u2217(1\u2212`,`)\n(i\u03b82n /\u03c0) * * * \u03a8\u2217(1\u2212`,`)\n(i\u03b82 /\u03c0)\u03a8\u03b5\u2217(`,1\u2212`)\n(i\u03b81 /\u03c0)\n\u03b52n\n\u03b52\n1\n\n1\n(Z (1\u2212`) )1/2\n\nx2H\n\n(1\u2212`)\n\n\u22121\nGj+`\n.
