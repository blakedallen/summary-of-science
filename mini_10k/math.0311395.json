In this article we construct a new family of simply connected symplectic\n2\n4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1 and c1 = 2 which are not diffeomorphic to rational surfaces by\nusing rational blow-down technique. As a corollary, we conclude that a rational surface\n2\nCP 2 \u266f7CP admits an exotic smooth structure.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the fundamental problems in the topology of 4-manifolds is to determine\nwhether a given topological 4-manifold admits a smooth structure and, if it does, whether\nsuch a smooth structure is unique or not. Though the complete answer is far from reach,\ngauge theory makes us to answer partially these questions ([FS1], [FS2], [G], [Sz], [T]).\nBut most known results are in the case of simply connected 4-manifolds with either b+\n2 >1\n2 \u2264 0. In the case when b+ = 1 and c2 > 0, a theorem of D. Kotschick\nodd or b+\n=\n1\nand\nc\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\nis the only known result that the Barlow surface is not diffeomorphic to CP 2 \u266f8CP ([K1]).\nSince then, there was little progress on the problems.\n2\nIn this paper we investigate exotic smooth structures on a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP .\nAccording to a convention, we say that a smooth 4-manifold admits an exotic smooth\nstructure if it has more than one distinct smooth structure. One way to get an exotic\nsmooth structure on a given smooth 4-manifold X is to construct a new smooth 4-manifold\nX \u2032 which is homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to X. Hence the problem of finding\n2\nexotic smooth structures on a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP is equivalent to find a new\n2\nfamily of simply connected smooth 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1 and c1 = 2. Note that the\n+\nonly known simply connected closed smooth 4-manifolds with b2 = 1 and c21 \u2265 2 are\n2\nrational surfaces such as CP2 , S 2 \u00d7 S 2 and CP 2 \u266fnCP (n \u2264 7). Despite the fact that it\nis no constraint on the existence of simply connected smooth 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1\nand c21 \u2265 2 which are not rational surfaces, no such 4-manifolds have been known. Thus\nit has long been an interesting question to find such 4-manifolds (refer to Problem 4.45\nin the Kirby list appeared in [Ka]). In Section 3 we construct a new family of simply\n2\nconnected symplectic 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1 and c1 = 2 which are homeomorphic, but\nnot diffeomorphic, to rational surfaces by using rational blow-down technique introduced\nby R. Fintushel and R. Stern in [FS1]. As one of our main results, we get the following\nTheorem 1.1. There exists a simply connected symplectic 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 and\n2\n2\nc1 = 2 which is homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP .\nDate: Revised: March 23, 2004.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Furthermore, by blowing up of a symplectic 4-manifold constructed in Theorem 1.1\n2\nabove, we also conclude that a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP admits at least three distinct\nsmooth structures - an Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature, an Einstein metric\nwith negative scalar curvature and no Einstein metric.\nAcknowledgements.

Preliminaries\nIn this section we briefly review the Seiberg-Witten theory and a rational blow-down\nsurgery which will be the main technical tools to get our results.\nFirst we briefly introduce the Seiberg-Witten theory for smooth 4-manifolds. In particular, we pay attention to the Seiberg-Witten invariant of 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1 ([M]\nfor details). Let X be a closed, oriented smooth 4-manifold with b+\n>\n0\nand\na fixed\n2\nmetric g, and let L be a characteristic line bundle on X, i.e. c1 (L) is an integral lift of\nw2 (X). This determines a Spinc -structure on X which induces a complex spinor bundle\nW \u223c\n= W + \u2295 W \u2212 , where W \u00b1 is the associated U (2)-bundles on X such that det(W \u00b1 ) \u223c\n= L.\nNote that the Levi-Civita connection on T X together with a unitary connection A on L\ninduces a connection \u2207A : \u0393(W + ) \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 X \u2297 W + ). This connection, followed by Clifford\nmultiplication, induces a Spinc -Dirac operator DA : \u0393(W + ) \u2192 \u0393(W \u2212 ). Then, for each\nself-dual 2-form h \u2208 \u03a92+g (X : R), the following pair of equations for a unitary connection\nA on L and a section \u03a8 of \u0393(W + ) are called the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations:\n\u001a\nDA \u03a8 = 0\n(1)\n(SWg,h )\n+\nFA g = i(\u03a8 \u2297 \u03a8\u2217 )0 + ih .\n+\n\nHere FA g is the self-dual part of the curvature of A with respect to a metric g on X and\n(\u03a8 \u2297 \u03a8\u2217 )0 is the trace-free part of (\u03a8 \u2297 \u03a8\u2217 ) which is interpreted as an endomorphism of\nW + . The gauge group G := Aut(L) \u223c\n= M ap(X, S 1 ) acts on the space AX (L) \u00d7 \u0393(W + ) by\ng * (A, \u03a8) = (g \u25e6 A \u25e6 g \u22121 , g * \u03a8)\nSince the set of solutions is invariant under the action, it induces an orbit space, called\nthe Seiberg-Witten moduli space, denoted by MX,g,h (L), whose formal dimension is\n1\ndimMX,g,h (L) = (c1 (L)2 \u2212 3\u03c3(X) \u2212 2e(X))\n4\nwhere \u03c3(X) is the signature of X and e(X) is the Euler characteristic of X. Note that\nif b+\n2 (X) > 0 and MX,g,h (L) 6= \u03c6, then for a generic self-dual 2-form h on X the moduli\nspace MX,g,h (L) contains no reducible solutions, so that it is a compact, oriented, smooth\n\n\f2\nSIMPLY CONNECTED SYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS WITH b+\n2 = 1 AND c1 = 2\n\n3\n\nmanifold of the given dimension.\nDefinition The Seiberg-Witten invariant (for brevity, SW-invariant) for a smooth 4c\nmanifold X with b+\n2 > 0 is a function SWX : Spin (X) \u2192 Z defined by\n\u001a\n< \u03b2 dL , [MX,g,h ] > if dimMX,g,h (L) := 2dL \u2265 0 and even\n(2)\nSWX (L) :=\n0\notherwise .\n\u2217 (L); Z) which is the first Chern class of the S 1 -bundle\nHere \u03b2 is a generator of H 2 (BX\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(L) = AX (L) \u00d7 (\u0393(W + )\u2212{0})/Aut0 (L) \u2212\u2192 BX\n(L)\nBeX\n\nwhere Aut0 (L) consists of gauge transformations which are the identity on the fiber of L\nover a fixed base point in X. Note that if b+\n2 (X) > 1, the Seiberg-Witten invariant, denoted\nP\nc\n(L)\n1\nby SWX =\nSWX (L) * e\n, is a diffeomorphism invariant, i.e. SWX does not depend\non the choice of a metric on X and a generic perturbation of Seiberg-Witten equations.\nFurthermore, only finitely many Spinc -structures on X have a non-zero Seiberg-Witten\ninvariant. We say that the characteristic line bundle L, equivalently a cohomology class\nc1 (L) \u2208 H 2 (X; Z), is a SW-basic class of X if SWX (L) 6= 0.\nWhen b+\n2 (X) = 1, the SW-invariant SWX (L) defined in (2) above depends not only\non a metric g but also on a self-dual 2-form h. Because of this fact, there are several\ntypes of Seiberg-Witten invariants for a smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 depending on\nhow to perturb the Seiberg-Witten equations. We introduce two types of SW-invariants\nand investigate how they are related. First we allow all metrics and self-dual 2-forms to\nperturb the Seiberg-Witten equations. Then the SW-invariant SWX (L) defined in (2)\nabove has generically two values which are determined by the sign of (2\u03c0c1 (L) + [h]) * [\u03c9g ],\nwhere \u03c9g is a unique g-self-dual harmonic 2-form of norm one lying in the (preassigned)\n2 (X; R). We denote the SW-invariant for a metric g and a\npositive component of H+\ng\ngeneric self-dual 2-form h satisfying (2\u03c0c1 (L) + [h]) * [\u03c9g ] > 0 by SWX+ (L) and denote\nthe other one by SWX\u2212 (L). Then the wall crossing formula tells us the relation between\nSWX+ (L) and SWX\u2212 (L).\nTheorem 2.1 (Wall crossing formula, [M]). Suppose that X is a closed, oriented smooth\n4-manifold with b1 = 0 and b+\n2 = 1. Then for each characteristic line bundle L on X such\nthat the formal dimension of the moduli space MX,g,h (L) is non-negative and even, say\n2dL , we have\nSWX+ (L) \u2212 SWX\u2212 (L) = \u2212(\u22121)dL .\nBy the way, C. Taubes' result on the SW-invariant of a symplectic 4-manifold with\nb+\n>\n1 can be easily extended to the b+\n2\n2 = 1 case.\nTheorem 2.2 ([T], [LL1]). Suppose X is a closed symplectic 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 and\n\u2212\na canonical class KX . Then SWX (\u2212KX ) = \u00b11.\nSecond one may perturb the Seiberg-Witten equations by adding only a small generic\nself-dual 2-form h \u2208 \u03a92+g (X; R), so that one can define the SW-invariants as in (2) above.\nIn this case we denote the SW-invariant for a metric g satisfying (2\u03c0c1 (L)) * [\u03c9g ] > 0 by\nSWX\u25e6,+ (L) and we denote the other one by SWX\u25e6,\u2212 (L). Note that SWX\u25e6,\u00b1 (L) = SWX\u00b1 (L).\nBut it sometimes happens that the sign of (2\u03c0c1 (L))*[\u03c9g ] is the same for all generic metrics,\n\n\f4\n\nJONGIL PARK\n\nso that there exists only one SW-invariant obtained by a small generic perturbation of the\nSeiberg-Witten equations. In such a case we define the SW-invariant of L on X by\n\u001a\nSWX\u25e6,+ (L) if 2\u03c0c1 (L) * [\u03c9g ] > 0\n\u25e6\nSWX (L) :=\nSWX\u25e6,\u2212 (L) if 2\u03c0c1 (L) * [\u03c9g ] < 0 .\nIf SWX\u25e6 (L) 6= 0, we call the corresponding c1 (L) (or L) a SW-basic class of X. Then\nP\nthe Seiberg-Witten invariant of X, denoted by SWX\u25e6 =\nSWX\u25e6 (L) * ec1 (L) , will also be a\ndiffeomorphism invariant. Furthermore we can extend many results obtained for smooth\n4-manifolds with b+\n2 > 1 to this case. For example, we have\nTheorem 2.3. Let X be a simply connected closed smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 and\nb\u2212\n\u2264\n9.\nThen\n2\n(i) There are only finitely many characteristic line bundles L on X such that SWX\u25e6 (L) 6= 0.\n(ii) If X admits a metric of positive scalar curvature, then the SW-invariant of X vanishes,\nthat is, SWX\u25e6 (L) = 0 for any characteristic line bundle L on X.\nProof : Proofs of (i) and (ii) are exactly the same as the proofs of case b+\n2 > 1 as long as\nthe SW-invariant SWX\u25e6 is well defined, i.e. it is independent of metrics on X. Let L be a\ncharacteristic line bundle on X such that the formal dimension, 41 (c1 (L)2 \u22123\u03c3(X)\u22122e(X)),\n\u2212\nof the moduli space is non-negative and even. The condition b+\n2 = 1 and b2 \u2264 9 imply\nthat c1 (L)2 \u2265 3\u03c3(X) + 2e(X) \u2265 0. Furthermore, since X is simply connected and c1 (L)\nis characteristic, c1 (L) 6= 0 (Otherwise, X has b\u2212\n2 = 9 and it is spin which contradicts the\nRohlin's signature theorem.) Thus, for any metric g on X, the light cone lemma implies\nc1 (L) * [\u03c9g ] 6= 0, so that the sign of (2\u03c0c1 (L)) * [\u03c9g ] is the same for all generic metrics.\nHence the SW-invariant SWX\u25e6 (L) is well defined. \u2737\nNext we briefly review a rational blow-down technique introduced by R. Fintushel and\nR. Stern and state related facts ([FS1] for details).\nLet Cp be a smooth 4-manifold obtained by plumbing the (p \u2212 1) disk bundles over the\n2-sphere instructed by the following diagram\n\u2212(p + 2)\nr\nup\u22121\n\n\u22122\nr\nup\u22122\n\n******\n\n\u22122\nr\nu1\n\nwhere each vertex ui represents a disk bundle over the 2-sphere with Euler class labelled\nabove and an interval between vertices indicates plumbing the disk bundles corresponding to the vertices. Label the homology classes represented by the 2-spheres in Cp by\nu1 , . . . , up\u22121 so that the self-intersections are u2p\u22121 = \u2212(p+2) and u2i = \u22122 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p\u22122.\nFurthermore, orient the 2-spheres so that ui * ui+1 = +1. Then a configuration Cp has the\nfollowing topological properties:\n(1) It is a negative definite simply connected smooth 4-manifold whose boundary is\nthe lens space L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p), and the lens space L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p) = \u2202Cp bounds a rational\nball Bp with \u03c01 (Bp ) \u223c\n= Zp .\nLp\u22121\nZ\n(2) H2 (Cp ; Z) \u223c\n= i=1 has generators {ui : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1}, where each ui can be\nrepresented by the zero-section Si2 of the disk bundle ui over S 2 (We use ui for\nboth a generator and the corresponding disk bundle).\n\n\f2\nSIMPLY CONNECTED SYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS WITH b+\n2 = 1 AND c1 = 2\n\n5\n\n(3) Let P be a plumbing matrix for Cp with respect to the basis {ui : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 1}.\nThen the intersection form on H 2 (Cp ; Q) with respect to the dual basis {\u03b3i : 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 p \u2212 1} (i.e. < \u03b3i , uj >= \u03b4ij ) is given by\nQ := (\u03b3i * \u03b3j ) = P \u22121 .\nFor example, when p = 7, we have the following intersection form on H 2 (C7 ; Q)\nwith respect to {\u03b3i : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6}:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n41 33 25 17 9 1\n\uf8ec 33 66 50 34 18 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u22121 \uf8ec\n25 50 75 51 27 3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nQ7 =\n\uf8f7\n49 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 17 34 51 68 36 4 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed 9 18 27 36 45 5 \uf8f8\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nDefinition Suppose X is a smooth 4-manifold which contains a configuration Cp . Then\nwe construct a new smooth 4-manifold Xp , called the rational blow-down of X, by replacing\nCp with a rational ball Bp . We call this a rational blow-down technique. Note that this\nprocess is well-defined, that is, a new smooth 4-manifold Xp is uniquely constructed (up\nto diffeomorphism) from X because each diffeomorphism of \u2202Bp = L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p) extends\nover the rational ball Bp . Furthermore, M. Symington proved that a rational blow-down\nmanifold Xp admits a symplectic structure in some cases.\nTheorem 2.4 ([Sy]). Suppose X is a symplectic 4-manifold containing a configuration\nCp with a symplectic 2-form \u03c9. If all 2-spheres ui in Cp are symplectically embedded and\nintersect positively, then the rational blow-down manifold Xp = X0 \u222aL(p2 ,1\u2212p) Bp admits a\nsymplectic 2-form \u03c9p such that (X0 , \u03c9p |X0 ) is symplectomorphic to (X0 , \u03c9|X0 ).\nRemark 1. Suppose X = X0 \u222aL(p2 ,1\u2212p) Cp is a symplectic 4-manifold with a canonical\nclass K and a compatible symplectic 2-form \u03c9. In the case when Xp = X0 \u222aL(p2 ,1\u2212p)\nBp admits a symplectic structure as in the Theorem 2.4 above, let \u03c9p be the induced\nsymplectic 2-form on Xp such that \u03c8p : (X0 , \u03c9p |X0 ) \u2192 (X0 , \u03c9|X0 ) is a symplectomorphism.\nWe also let Kp be the canonical class on Xp which is induced from the symplectic 2-form\n\u03c9p on Xp . Then, since H 1 (L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p); Q) = H 2 (L(p2 , 1 \u2212 p); Q) = 0, if we decompose\nK and \u03c9 as\nK = K|X0 + K|Cp and [\u03c9] = [\u03c9|X0 ] + [\u03c9|Cp ]\nwith K|X0 , [\u03c9|X0 ] \u2208 H 2 (X0 ; Q) and K|Cp , [\u03c9|Cp ] \u2208 H 2 (Cp ; Q), we can also decompose\nKp and \u03c9p as\nKp = Kp |X0 + Kp |Bp and [\u03c9p ] = [\u03c9p |X0 ] + [\u03c9p |Bp ].\nLemma 2.1. Under the same hypothesis on (X, K, \u03c9) and (Xp , Kp , \u03c9p ) as above, we have\nKp * [\u03c9p ] = K * [\u03c9] \u2212 K|Cp * [\u03c9|Cp ].\nProof : Since Kp |Bp and [\u03c9p |Bp ] are zero elements in H 2 (Bp ; Q), we have\nKp * [\u03c9p ] = Kp |X0 * [\u03c9p |X0 ] = \u03c8p\u2217 (K|X0 ) * \u03c8p\u2217 ([\u03c9|X0 ])\n= K|X0 * [\u03c9|X0 ] = K * [\u03c9] \u2212 K|Cp * [\u03c9|Cp ].\n\n\u2737\n\n\f6\n\nJONGIL PARK\n\n3. A Main Construction\nIn this section we construct a new family of simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds\n2\nwith b+\n2 = 1 and c1 = 2 which are homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to rational\nsurfaces by using rational blow-down technique introduced by R. Fintushel and R. Stern\nin [FS1].\n2\nLet us start with analyzing a simply connected rational surface E(1) = CP 2 \u266f9CP .\nThere are several ways to describe E(1). One way to construct E(1) is to take two generic\ncubic curves in CP 2 which intersect each other at 9 points and then blow up 9 times at\n2\nthese points in CP 2 . This viewpoint makes us to see E(1) = CP 2 \u266f9CP as a Lefschetz\nfibration over CP 1 whose generic fiber is an elliptic curve, say f , and which also has 6\nsingular cusp fibers (or, equivalently, 12 singular fishtail fibers). Since 4 singular cusp\nf6 -singular fiber, E(1) can also be described as an\nfibers in E(1) can be deformed to an E\n1\nf6 -fiber and two cusp fibers. Note\nelliptic fibration over CP with 3 singular fibers, one E\nf\nthat a neighborhood of the E6 -fiber in E(1) is a smooth 4-manifold obtained by plumbing\ndisk bundles over the holomorphically embedded 2-spheres Si (1 \u2264 i \u2264 7) of square \u22122\nf6 ([HKK] for details).\ninstructed by the Dynkin diagram of E\nS7 r \u22122\nS6 r \u22122\n\u22122\nr\nS1\n\n\u22122\nr\nS2\n\nr\u22122\n\nS3\n\n\u22122\nr\nS4\n\n\u22122\nr\nS5\n\nf6 -singular fiber\nFigure 1. E\n\nLemma 3.1 ([A], [F]). The second (co)homology classes [Si ] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 7) of the 2-spheres\nf6 can be represented by [S1 ] = e4 \u2212e7 , [S2 ] = e1 \u2212e4 , [S3 ] = h\u2212e1 \u2212e2 \u2212e3 ,\nSi embedded in E\n[S4 ] = e2 \u2212e5 , [S5 ] = e5 \u2212e9 , [S6 ] = e3 \u2212e6 and [S7 ] = e6 \u2212e8 , where h denotes a generator of\nH2 (CP 2 ; Z) and each ei denotes the (co)homology class represented by the ith exceptional\n2\n2\ncurve in CP \u2282 E(1) = CP 2 \u266f9CP .\nProof : Note that E(1) can be constructed as follows: First choose a generic cubic\ncurve C (represented homologically by 3h) which intersects with a line (represented by\nh) at 3 points in CP 2 . And then blow up at these 3 points, so that we get an embedded 2-sphere S3 , represented by h \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 e3 , of multiplicity 3 and of square\n2\n\u22122 in CP 2 \u266f3CP . Again blow up 3 times at the intersection points between the curve\nC \u2212e1 \u2212e2 \u2212e3 and 3 exceptional curves e1 , e2 and e3 respectively, so that we get embedded\n2-spheres S2 = e1 \u2212 e4 , S4 = e2 \u2212 e5 and S6 = e3 \u2212 e6 of multiplicities 2 and of squares\n2\n\u22122 in CP 2 \u266f6CP . Finally blow up 3 times at the intersection points between the curve\nC \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 e6 and 3 new exceptional curves e4 , e5 and e6 respectively, so that we\nget again embedded 2-spheres S1 = e4 \u2212 e7 , S5 = e5 \u2212 e9 and S7 = e6 \u2212 e8 of multiplicities\n2\n1 and of squares \u22122 in CP 2 \u266f9CP . Then the embedded 2-spheres {S1 . . . S7 } consists of\nf6 -singular fiber in E(1). \u2737\nE\n\n\f2\nSIMPLY CONNECTED SYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS WITH b+\n2 = 1 AND c1 = 2\n\n7\n\nNote that the standard canonical class KE(1) \u2208 H 2 (E(1); Z) of E(1) is represented\nby KE(1) = \u22123h + (e1 + * * * + e9 ) = \u2212[f ]. Furthermore, there is a relation between the\ncanonical class and a compatible symplectic 2-form on a non-minimal rational surface\nwhich will play an important role in the proof of our main results. Explicitly, we have\n2\n\nLemma 3.2. For each integer k \u2265 1, there exists a symplectic 2-form \u03c9 on E(1)\u266fkCP\nwhich is compatible with the standard canonical class KE(1)\u266fkCP 2 = \u22123h + (e1 + * * * + e9+k )\nsuch that its cohomology class [\u03c9] can be represented by ah \u2212 (b1 e1 + * * * + b9+k e9+k )\nfor some rational numbers a, b1 , . . . , b9+k satisfying a \u2265 b1 \u2265 b2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 b9+k \u2265 0 and\n3a > b1 + * * * + b9+k .\n2\n\nProof : Since E(1)\u266fkCP is a rational surface, there exists a symplectic 2-form \u03c9\n2\non E(1)\u266fkCP which is compatible with the standard canonical class KE(1)\u266fkCP 2 =\n\u22123h + (e1 + * * * + e9+k ) satisfying KE(1)\u266fkCP 2 * [\u03c9] < 0 (refer to Corollary 1.4 in [MS]). Furthermore, Lemma 4.7 in [LL2] guarantees that the cohomology class [\u03c9] of the symplectic\n2-form \u03c9 can be represented by ah \u2212 (b1 e1 + * * * + b9+k e9+k ) for some rational numbers\na, b1 , . . . , b9+k satisfying a \u2265 b1 \u2265 b2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 b9+k \u2265 0. The inequality 3a > b1 + * * * + b9+k\nfollows from the fact that KE(1)\u266fkCP 2 * [\u03c9] < 0. \u2737\nIn fact, T. Li and A. Liu obtained many results regarding symplectic structures and\ncanonical classes on symplectic 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1. For example, they proved\n2\n\nLemma 3.3 ([LL1]). There is a unique symplectic structure on CP 2 \u266fkCP for 2 \u2264 k \u2264 9\nup to diffeomorphisms and deformation. For k \u2265 10, the symplectic structure is still\n2\nunique for the standard canonical class. In particular, CP 2 \u266fkCP (2 \u2264 k \u2264 9) does not\nadmit a symplectic 2-form \u03c9 for which c1 (K) * [\u03c9] > 0.\n2\n\nProposition 3.1. There exists a configuration C7 in a rational surface E(1)\u266f4CP such\nthat all 2-spheres ui lying in C7 are symplectically embedded.\nf6 -singular fiber\nProof : Note that E(1) can be viewed as an elliptic fibration with an E\nand 2 cusp singular fibers (equivalently, 4 singular fishtail fibers). Since the homology\nclass [f ] of the elliptic fiber f in E(1) can be represented by an immersed 2-sphere with\none positive double point (equivalently, a fishtail fiber) and since E(1) contains at least\n4 such immersed 2-spheres, we blow up 4 times at these double points so that there exist\n2\nembedded 2-spheres, f \u2212 2e10 , . . . , f \u2212 2e13 , in E(1)\u266f4CP which intersect a section e9 of\nE(1) positively at points, say p1 , . . . , p4 , respectively. And then, resolving symplectically\nthe intersection points p1 , . . . , p4 between f \u2212 2e10 , . . . , f \u2212 2e13 and e9 , we have a symplec2\ntically embedded 2-sphere, denoted by S, in E(1)\u266f4CP which represents a homology class\n(f \u2212 2e10 ) + * * * + (f \u2212 2e13 ) + e9 = 4f + e9 \u2212 2(e10 + * * * + e13 ) with square \u22129. Now, using\na linear plumbing manifold consisting of 5 disk bundles {S1 , S2 , . . . , S5 } lying in a neighf6 -singular fiber (Figure 1), we obtain a configuration C7 \u2282 E(1)\u266f4CP2\nborhood of an E\nby setting u1 = S1 , u2 = S2 , . . . , u5 = S5 and u6 = S (Figure 2). Note that all 2-spheres\nui lying in the configuration C7 are symplectically embedded. \u2737\n2\n\nRemark 2. Note that there are other candidates for a configuration C7 in E(1)\u266f4CP\nf6 -singular\nby choosing a different linear plumbing manifold lying in a neighborhood of an E\n\n\f8\n\nJONGIL PARK\n\n\u22129\nr\nu6\n\n\u22122\nr\nu5\n\n\u22122\nr\nu1\n\n******\n\nFigure 2.

For example, one may choose a linear plumbing manifold consisting of 5 disk bundles {S1 , S2 , S3 , S6 , S7 } in Figure 1 to get a configuration C7 .\nTheorem 3.1. There exists a simply connected symplectic 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 and\n2\n2\n2\nc1 = 2 which is homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to CP \u266f7CP .\nProof : Construction - By Proposition 3.1 above, we have a symplectically embedded\n2\nconfiguration C7 in a rational surface X := E(1)\u266f4CP . Hence we get a new smooth\n4-manifold, denoted by X7 = X0 \u222aL(49,\u22126) B7 , by rationally blowing down along the\nconfiguration C7 in X = X0 \u222aL(49,\u22126) C7 . Furthermore, Theorem 2.4 guarantees the\nexistence of a symplectic structure on X7 .\nProperties of X7 - Since a circle representing a generator of \u03c01 (L(49, \u22126)) bounds\nf6 -singular fiber, \u03c01 (X0 ) = 1. Hence the\na disk which is a hemisphere of S6 lying in E\nsimple connectivity of X7 follows from Van-Kampen's theorem. Furthermore, it satisfies\n2\nc21 (X7 ) = c21 (X) + 6 = 2, so that it is homeomorphic to CP 2 \u266f7CP due to M. Freedman's classification theorem of simply connected closed topological 4-manifolds. It only\n2\nremains to show that X7 is not diffeomorphic to CP 2 \u266f7CP . For this, we first claim that\nthe canonical class K7 on X7 and the corresponding symplectic 2-form \u03c97 on X7 satisfy\nK7 * [\u03c97 ] > 0. Then, since b\u2212\n2 (X7 ) \u2264 9 and (\u2212K7 ) * [\u03c97 ] < 0, the Seiberg-Witten invariant\nSWX\u25e6 7 is well defined and we have SWX\u25e6 7 (\u2212K7 ) = SWX\u25e6,\u2212\n(\u2212K7 ) = SWX\u22127 (\u2212K7 ) = \u00b11,\n7\nwhere the last equality follows from Theorem 2.2. Note that the non-triviality of SWX\u25e6 7\nmeans that X7 does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature, equivalently, it is not\ndiffeomorphic to a rational surface. Hence we are done.\n2\nProof of K7 * [\u03c97 ] > 0 - Note that the canonical class K of X = E(1)\u266f4CP is represented by K = \u22123h + (e1 + * * * + e13 ) = \u2212[f ] + (e10 + * * * + e13 ) and, by modifying B.\nLi and T. Li's symplectic cone argument in [LL2], we may assume that the cohomology\nclass [\u03c9] of a symplectic 2-form \u03c9 on X compatible with a canonical class K can be represented by ah \u2212 (b1 e1 + * * * + b13 e13 ) for some rational numbers a, b1 , . . . , b13 satisfying\na \u2265 b1 \u2265 b2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 b13 \u2265 0 and 3a > b1 + * * * + b13 (refer to Lemma 3.2). Now, remembering that u6 = S = 4f + e9 \u2212 2(e10 + * * * + e13 ) = 12h+ e9 \u2212 4(e1 + * * * + e9 )\u2212 2(e10 + * * * + e13 )\nin Proposition 3.1 and the canonical class K does not intersect with holomorphic 2-spheres\nui (1 \u2264 i \u2264 5) of square \u22122, let us express two cohomology classes K|C7 and [\u03c9|C7 ] using\na dual basis {\u03b3i : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6} (i.e. < \u03b3i , uj >= \u03b4ij ) for H 2 (C7 ; Q):\nK|C7\n\u03c9|C7\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(K * u1 )\u03b31 + (K * u2 )\u03b32 + * * * + (K * u6 )\u03b36\n7\u03b36 and\n([\u03c9] * u1 )\u03b31 + ([\u03c9] * u2 )\u03b32 + * * * + ([\u03c9] * u5 )\u03b35 + ([\u03c9] * u6 )\u03b36\n(b4 \u2212 b7 )\u03b31 + (b1 \u2212 b4 )\u03b32 + (a \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2 \u2212 b3 )\u03b33 + (b2 \u2212 b5 )\u03b34\n+(b5 \u2212 b9 )\u03b35 + {12a \u2212 4(b1 + * * * + b9 ) \u2212 2(b10 + * * * + b13 ) + b9 }\u03b36 .\n\n\f2\nSIMPLY CONNECTED SYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS WITH b+\n2 = 1 AND c1 = 2\n\n9\n\nThen, using the intersection form Q7 on H 2 (C7 ; Q), we have\nK|C7 * [\u03c9|C7 ] =\n\n=\n\n\u22121\n{(b4 \u2212 b7 ) + 2(b1 \u2212 b4 ) + 3(a \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2 \u2212 b3 ) + 4(b2 \u2212 b5 )\n7\n+5(b5 \u2212 b9 ) + 6(12a \u2212 4(b1 + * * * + b9 ) \u2212 2(b10 + * * * + b13 ) + b9 )}\n\u22121\n{75a \u2212 25b1 \u2212 23b2 \u2212 27b3 \u2212 25b4 \u2212 23b5 \u2212 24b6 \u2212 25b7 \u2212 24b8\n7\n\u221223b9 \u2212 12(b10 + * * * + b13 )}.\n\nHence, by Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 3.2, we have\nK7 * [\u03c97 ] = K * [\u03c9] \u2212 K|C7 * [\u03c9|C7 ]\n= {\u22123a + (b1 + * * * + b13 )} \u2212 K|C7 * [\u03c9|C7 ]\n1\n=\n{54a \u2212 18b1 \u2212 16b2 \u2212 20b3 \u2212 18b4 \u2212 16b5 \u2212 17b6 \u2212 18b7 \u2212 17b8\n7\n\u221216b9 \u2212 5(b10 + * * * + b13 )}\n1\n{2b2 \u2212 2b3 + 2b5 + b6 + b8 + 2b9 + 13(b10 + * * * + b13 )}\n>\n7\n\u2265 0. \u2737\nRemark 3. Since the canonical class K7 induced from a symplectic structure \u03c97 on\nthe symplectic 4-manifold X7 constructed in the proof of Theorem 3.1 above satisfies\nK7 * [\u03c97 ] > 0, one can also conclude directly from Lemma 3.3 that X7 is not diffeomorphic\n2\nto a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP .\n2\n\nRemark 4. Similarly, using various different configurations C7 lying in E(1)\u266f4CP\n(refer to Remark 2) and the same technique as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 above, we can\n2\nconstruct a family of simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1 and c1 = 2\n2\nwhich are all homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP . But\nwe do not know whether all these symplectic 4-manifolds are mutually diffeomorphic to\neach other.\nRemark 5. There are still some important questions to be solved regarding on the\nsymplectic 4-manifold X7 . For example, though it is likely to be minimal, it is not easy to\ndetermine whether X7 is minimal. Furthermore, it is a very intriguing question whether\nX7 admits a complex structure.\nRemark 6. Theorem 3.1 above enables us to confirm that a rational surface CP 2 \u266f7CP\nadmits an exotic smooth structure.\n\n2\n\n2\n4.

In this section, using the same technique as in the proof\nof Theorem 3.1 above, we construct simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds which are\n2\nhomeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP .\n\n\f10\n\nJONGIL PARK\n2\n\nProposition 4.1. There exists a configuration C5 in a rational surface E(1)\u266f3CP such\nthat all 2-spheres ui lying in C5 are symplectically embedded.\nProof : As in the proof of Proposition 3.1, we blow up 3 times at the double points\nof singular fishtail fibers so that there exist embedded 2-spheres, f \u2212 2e10 , . . . , f \u2212 2e12 ,\n2\nin E(1)\u266f3CP which intersect a section e2 of E(1) positively at points, say p1 , . . . , p3 ,\nrespectively. And then, resolving symplectically the intersection points p1 , . . . , p3 between\nf \u2212 2e10 , . . . , f \u2212 2e12 and e2 , we have a symplectically embedded 2-sphere, denoted by\n2\nS, in E(1)\u266f3CP which represents a homology class (f \u2212 2e10 ) + * * * + (f \u2212 2e12 ) + e2 =\n3f +e2 \u22122(e10 +* * *+e12 ) with square \u22127. Now, using a linear plumbing manifold consisting\nf6 -singular fiber (Figure 1),\nof 3 disk bundles {S1 , S2 , S3 } lying in a neighborhood of an E\n2\nwe obtain a configuration C5 \u2282 E(1)\u266f3CP by setting u1 = S1 , u2 = S2 , u3 = S3 and\nu4 = S. \u2737\nTheorem 4.1. There exists a simply connected symplectic 4-manifold with b+\n2 = 1 and\n2\n2\nc1 = 1 which is homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP .\nProof : By Proposition 4.1 above, we have a symplectically embedded configuration\n2\nC5 in a rational surface X := E(1)\u266f3CP . Hence we get a new smooth 4-manifold,\ndenoted by X5 = X0 \u222aL(25,\u22124) B5 , by rationally blowing down along the configuration\nC5 in X = X0 \u222aL(25,\u22124) C5 . Then the rest of proof is exactly the same as the proof of\nTheorem 3.1 above except a computation of K5 * [\u03c95 ] > 0, which is the following:\nIn this case, we have K = \u22123h + (e1 + * * * + e12 ) and [\u03c9] = ah \u2212 (b1 e1 + * * * + b12 e12 )\nfor some rational numbers a, b1 , . . . , b12 satisfying a \u2265 b1 \u2265 b2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 b12 \u2265 0 and\n3a > b1 + * * * + b12 . Now, using u4 = S = 3f + e2 \u2212 2(e10 + * * * + e12 ) = 9h + e2 \u2212 3(e1 +\n* * * + e9 ) \u2212 2(e10 + * * * + e12 ), we have\nK|C5\n\u03c9|C5\n\n= (K * u1 )\u03b31 + * * * + (K * u4 )\u03b34 = 5\u03b34 and\n= ([\u03c9] * u1 )\u03b31 + * * * + ([\u03c9] * u4 )\u03b34\n= (b4 \u2212 b7 )\u03b31 + (b1 \u2212 b4 )\u03b32 + (a \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2 \u2212 b3 )\u03b33\n+{9a \u2212 3(b1 + * * * + b9 ) \u2212 2(b10 + * * * + b12 ) + b2 }\u03b34 .\n\nHence, by Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 3.2, we get\n\u22121\nK|C5 * [\u03c9|C5 ] =\n{(b4 \u2212 b7 ) + 2(b1 \u2212 b4 ) + 3(a \u2212 b1 \u2212 b2 \u2212 b3 )\n5\n+4(9a \u2212 3(b1 + * * * + b9 ) \u2212 2(b10 + * * * + b12 ) + b2 )}\n\u22121\n{39a \u2212 13b1 \u2212 11b2 \u2212 15b3 \u2212 13b4 \u2212 12(b5 + b6 ) \u2212 13b7\n=\n5\n\u221212(b8 + b9 ) \u2212 8(b10 + * * * + b12 )},\nK5 * [\u03c95 ] = K * [\u03c9] \u2212 K|C5 * [\u03c9|C5 ]\n1\n{24a \u2212 8b1 \u2212 6b2 \u2212 10b3 \u2212 8b4 \u2212 7(b5 + b6 ) \u2212 8b7\n=\n5\n\u22127(b8 + b9 ) \u2212 3(b10 + * * * + b12 )}\n1\n{2b2 \u2212 2b3 + b5 + b6 + b8 + b9 + 5(b10 + * * * + b12 )}\n>\n5\n\u2265 0.\n\u2737\n\n\f2\nSIMPLY CONNECTED SYMPLECTIC 4-MANIFOLDS WITH b+\n2 = 1 AND c1 = 2\n\n11\n2\n\nRemark 7. Similarly, using various different configurations C5 lying in E(1)\u266f3CP ,\nwe can also construct a family of simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds with b+\n2 = 1\n2\nand c1 = 1 which are all homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to a rational surface\n2\nCP 2 \u266f8CP . But we do not know whether one of these symplectic 4-manifolds is diffeomorphic to a Barlow surface.\n2\n\nFinally, we also investigate exotic smooth structures on a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP .\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, Barlow surface, denoted by B, is homeomorphic, but\n2\n2\nnot diffeomorphic, to a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP . Furthermore, whereas CP 2 \u266f8CP\nadmits an Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature, B admits an Einstein metric\nwith negative scalar curvature. Now, since a symplectic 4-manifold X7 constructed in\nTheorem 3.1 has a nontrivial SW-basic class K7 obtained by a small generic perturbation,\n2\nso that its blow-up manifold X7 \u266fCP has at least two (up to sign) SW-basic classes,\nK7 + E and K7 \u2212 E (E is an exceptional curve obtained by a blowing up), we conclude\n2\nthat the blow-up manifold X7 \u266fCP is also homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic, to both\n2\n2\nB and CP 2 \u266f8CP . Furthermore, D. Kotschick pointed out that X7 \u266fCP does not admit\nan Einstein metric, which can be deduced from his result regarding on the existence\nof Einstein metrics (Theorem 4.3 below for details). Hence we get the following useful\n2\ninformation about exotic smooth structures on a rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP . Before we\nstate our final result, we first quote a theorem of D. Kotschick:\nTheorem 4.2 ([K2]). Let X be a smooth 4-manifold with a monopole class c. If X\n2\nadmits an Einstein metric, then the maximal number k of copies of CP that can be split\noff smoothly is bounded by\n1\nk \u2264 {2e(X) + 3\u03c3(X) \u2212 8d}\n2\nwhere d is the dimension of moduli space of the solutions of Seiberg-Witten equations\ncorresponding to a monopole class c.\n2\n\nTheorem 4.3. A rational surface CP 2 \u266f8CP admits at least three distinct smooth structures - an Einstein metric with positive scalar curvature, an Einstein metric with negative\nscalar curvature and no Einstein metric.\n2\n\n2\n\nProof : Since X7 \u266fCP , B and CP 2 \u266f8CP are not mutually diffeomorphic to each\n2\nother, and since B and CP 2 \u266f8CP have desired Einstein metrics, it only suffices to show\n2\nthat X7 \u266fCP does not admit an Einstein metric. For this, suppose that a symplectic\n2\n2\n4-manifold X7 \u266fCP has an Einstein metric and apply Theorem 4.2 above to X7 \u266fCP .\nThen we have 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12 {2e(X) + 3\u03c3(X) \u2212 8d} = 12 , which is a contradiction. \u2737\n\nReferences\n[A]\nD.
