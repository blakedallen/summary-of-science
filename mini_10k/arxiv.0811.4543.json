Finally, we demonstrate the realization of the \"non-standard scenario\" for the critical\nsurface in a three-flavor PNJL model with a \u03bc-dependent determinant interaction.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe investigation of the QCD phase transition and the structure of the phase diagram is certainly one\nof the most exciting areas in the field of strong interaction physics. A theoretical approach to these\nquestions requires non-perturbative methods, which also provide a proper understanding of the chiral\nquark dynamics and the confinement mechanism. Until now, the only method which is directly based\non QCD and which meets these requirements is lattice gauge theory. Unfortunately, the application\nof lattice results to experimental data is complicated by the fact that most lattice calculations are\noften performed with rather large quark masses, leading to unphysically large pion masses. Even more\ndifficult is the extension of lattice calculations to nonvanishing chemical potentials, where the standard\nimportance sampling techniques are spoiled by the \"sign problem\". To bridge this gap between existing\nlattice data and phenomenologically interesting regimes which are not yet accessible by first principles,\neffective models which share the relevant symmetries with QCD can deal as useful tools. In this context,\nthe Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is probably the most popular example. More recently, the\nPolyakov-loop extended Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) [1, 2] has received increasing interest, as it allows\nto investigate both, the chiral and the deconfinement phase transition by studying the corresponding\norder parameters. Moreover, the coupling of the quark dynamics to the Polyakov loop cures, at least\nto a large extent, one of the most disturbing features of the NJL model, namely the contribution of\nunconfined quarks to the pressure at low temperatures and densities.\nIn the following, we will discuss three applications of NJL and PNJL-models to issues related to the\nphase diagram.\n1\n\n\f0.8\n\n0.7\nT =202 MeV\nC\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\nm/T=0.4\nmean field(MF)\n\n0.6\n\n,\n\n(ideal)\n\n,\n\n(in-medium)\n\nMF+\n0.4\n\nMF+\n\nRef.

Red dashed line: Lattice data for two-flavor QCD with\nstaggered quarks [5]. Points: Lattice data for two-flavor QCD with Wilson-type quarks [6]\nfor Nt = 6 (open symbols) and Nt = 4 (green filled symbols). The data for the pressure [6]\nhave been divided by the Stefan-Boltzmann limit for Nt = 6 and Nt = 4, respectively, as\ngiven in Ref. [6]. Figures adapted from Ref. [4].\n\n2\n\nEffects of mesonic correlations\n\nIn spite of the simplicity of the PNJL model, a remarkable agreement with the results of lattice QCD\nthermodynamics have been obtained in Ref. [3]. However, that comparison was not entirely consistent:\nWhereas unphysically large values of the current quark masses have been used in the lattice simulations,\nphysical values have been employed in the PNJL model analysis of Ref. [3]. Moreover, after successfully\nremoving (most of) the unphysical quark degrees of freedom from the confined phase, the PNJL model\ntreated in mean-field approximation as in Ref. [3] does not contain any degree of freedom in this regime.\nObviously, this is a rather poor description of the hadronic phase at finite temperature where mesons are\nexpected to become relevant. Hence, the good agreement of the PNJL results with the lattice data could\nbe partially accidental in that mesonic correlations have been neglected in the PNJL analysis, while\nin the lattice calculations they are suppressed by the large current quark masses. To get a consistent\npicture one should thus go beyond the mean-field approximation and include mesonic correlations.\nHere we briefly discuss the main results of Ref. [4], where we have done this in the framework of a\n1/Nc expansion to next-to-leading order. Up to an additive constant, the thermodynamic potential at\n\u03bc = 0 is then given by \u03a9(T ) = \u03a9mean field (T ) + \u03a9corr (T ) where the correlation part\n\u03a9corr (T ) =\n\nX\n\nM =\u03c0,\u03c3\n\ndM\n\nT X Z d3 p\nln [1 \u2212 G\u03a0M (~p, \u03c9m )]\n2 m\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(1)\n\ncorresponds to the ring-sum of RPA-like polarization loops \u03a0M in the mesonic channel M with degeneracy factor dM . These terms are worked out within a two-flavor PNJL-type model with a nonlocal\n4-point interaction in the quark sector with a Gaussian form factor. This interaction has the advantage\nthat all diagrams are finite. Further details of the model can be found in Ref. [4].\nOur main results are shown in Fig. 1. On the left hand side, the pressure p(T ) = \u2212\u03a9(T ), divided\n2\n\n\fby the Stefan-Boltzmann limit, is displayed as a function of the temperature. For comparison with\nthe full result we also show the mean-field result and the mean-field plus pion contribution as well\nas the result for an ideal pion and sigma gas with the masses fixed at their vacuum values. We find\nthat at low temperatures the mean-field (i.e., quark) contribution is suppressed and the pressure can\nbe well described by a free pion gas. Near the critical temperature the \u03c3 meson gives an additional\nvisible contribution whereas already for T > 1.5 Tc the mesonic contributions are negligible and the\nquark-gluon mean-field dominates the pressure.\nThe results shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 have been obtained using realistic parameters with a\ncurrent quark mass m = 5.8 MeV, corresponding to the physical pion mass of 140 MeV in vacuum.\nOn the other hand, in most lattice calculations the masses are considerably larger. Thus in order to\nperform a meaningful comparison with lattice results, we should repeat our model calculations using\nquark masses similar to the lattice ones. To be specific, we choose the current quark mass to scale with\nthe temperature as m = 0.4 T , mimicking the situation in the lattice calculation of Ref. [5], where the\nup and down quark masses behave in this way. The resulting pressure is displayed by the blue dotted\nline in the right panel of Fig. 1. For comparison we show again the result obtained with m = 5.8 MeV\n(black solid line). With m = 0.4 T the qualitative behavior remains unchanged. Quantitatively, the\nmeson contributions are of course suppressed by their higher masses, but they are still visible.\nThe red dashed line indicates the result of Ref. [5] obtained on a 163 \u00d7 4 lattice with improved\nstaggered fermion actions for two flavors. As mentioned above, in this calculation the quark mass scales\nwith the temperature, mu,d /T = 0.4 and should therefore be compared with the blue dotted line. In the\nfigure, we also show the lattice results of Ref. [6] for Wilson fermions. Although these data have been\nextracted for T -independent quark masses and are therefore not entirely comparable to the staggered\nfermion data (and to our calculations), they show a similar tendency.\nWhereas in our model, even for m = 0.4 T , there remains a visible pion contribution to the pressure\ndown to T /Tc \u2248 0.2, the lattice pressure of [5] vanishes at T /Tc = 0.6. This discrepancy has a trivial\nexplanation by the fact that the lattice pressure has been obtained by the \"integral method\" which\nleaves one integration constant undetermined. In Ref. [5], this constant has been fixed by the choice\nthat the pressure vanishes at T /Tc = 0.6. On the other hand, chiral perturbation theory predicts that\nat very low temperature the pressure is well described by an ideal pion gas, in good agreement with our\nmodel. Hence, if the integration constant on the lattice had been fitted to \u03c7P T , rather than setting\nthe pressure at T = 0.6 Tc equal to zero, there would be good agreement with our results at this point.\nOn the other hand, our approach underestimates the lattice data in the region between about 0.9 and\n1.6 Tc . The missing pressure would be even larger if we shift the lattice pressure upwards to obtain\nagreement at T = 0.6 Tc . This indicates that hadronic resonances, other than pion and sigma become\nimportant in this regime and should be taken into account in improved versions of the model.\n\n3\n\nAssessing the phase diagram via Taylor expansion\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction a straight forward application of standard lattice techniques to\nthe regime of non-vanishing quark number chemical potential \u03bc is not possible. In this context various\nmethods have been suggested to circumvent these problems. One of these methods consists in performing\na Taylor expansion of the pressure in powers of \u03bc/T , with the Taylor coefficients evaluated at \u03bc = 0,\n\u221e\nX\np\n\u03bc\ncn (T )\n(T,\n\u03bc)\n=\n4\nT\nT\nn=0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013n\n\n,\n\ncn (T ) =\n\n1\n\u2202\nn! \u2202(\u03bc/T )n\n\n\u0012\n\np\n(T, \u03bc)\nT4\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bc=0\n\nOne may also consider different chemical potentials for up, down, and strange quarks or, equivalently,\nfor baryon number, electric charge and strangeness, but here we want to restrict ourselves to the case of\na single chemical potential.

Also shown are lattice results for cn from Ref. [8] (points).\nAdapted from Ref. [9].\n\nIn recent lattice calculations coefficients up to n = 8 have been calculated [7], but most studies so far\nwere restricted to n \u2264 6 [8]. It is then a natural question, how reliably this information can be used\nto reconstruct the phase boundary at non-zero \u03bc. It would also be interesting to know whether one\ncould find signatures of a critical endpoint in this way. Such questions can be addressed by performing\na Taylor expansion in a model where the phase boundary and the location of the critical endpoint are\nknown \"exactly\" (in the sense of the model).\nHere we want to discuss some results of Ref. [9], where the Taylor expansion has been studied\nwithin a two-flavor NJL model without Polyakov loop in mean-field approximation. The \"exact\" phase\ndiagram of that model is shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. At large chemical potentials we find a\nfirst-order phase boundary (solid line), which ends at a critical point at \u03bc/T \u2248 4. For lower values of\n\u03bc/T , there is a smooth crossover, which is indicated by the dotted line. This crossover line has been\ndefined as the maxima of the reduced chiral susceptibility,\n\u03c7mm (T, \u03bc)\n1 \u2202 2 p(T, \u03bc)\n=\n,\nT2\nT 2 \u2202m2\n\n(3)\n\nalong lines of constant \u03bc/T .

Our model results are indicated by the lines. For the cn we also\nshow the lattice results of Ref. [8] for illustration. We see that the qualitative behavior is similar, but\nthere are quantitative differences. In particular the Stefan Boltzmann limits, which are also indicated\nin the figure, are reached much faster in the model. This is an artifact of the NJL model which can be\nimproved considerably by including the Polyakov loop [10].\n4\n\n\f200\n\n210\n\n0.1\n\n1st order\ncrossover\nCEP\n\n150\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\nexact\n2nd order\n4th order\n\n200\n\nT in MeV\n\nT in MeV\n\n6th order\n\u03bc/T=1.0\n\n100\n\n2.0\n3.0\n50\n\n190\n180\n1.0\n170\n\n3.92\n\n0\n\n160\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n0\n\n\u03bc in MeV\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n\u03bc in MeV\n\nFigure 3: Phase diagram of the 2-flavor NJL model. Left: exact mean-field result for the\ncrossover line (dotted) and the first-order phase boundary (solid). Right: comparison of\nthe exact crossover line at small chemical potential with the reconstructed results from the\nTaylor expansion of the chiral susceptibility to 2nd, 4th, and 6th order. In both figures, the\nradial lines are lines of constant \u03bc/T , as indicated. Adapted from Ref. [9].\n\nHowever, our present focus is not on a comparison between model and lattice calculations but on\na comparison within the NJL model between the \"exact\" phase boundary and the reconstructed result\nobtained from the chiral susceptibility calculated with the first few Taylor terms. This comparison is\nshown in the right panel of Fig. 3. As one can see, even with the 6th-order terms included, the crossover\nline starts to deviate from the exact result already below \u03bc/T \u2248 0.6. This limit cannot be pushed much\nfurther by including more Taylor terms: As obvious from Fig. 2, higher-order Taylor terms become\nmore and more oscillatory. As a consequence, the reconstructed chiral susceptibility does not have one,\nbut several maxima above a certain value of \u03bc/T and the crossover line is no longer unique.\n\n4\n\nThe critical surface\n\nIt is now widely accepted that the finite-temperature QCD \"phase transition\" at \u03bc = 0 is in fact a\nrapid, but smooth crossover. More precisely, this is expected to be the case in the \"real world\" with\nphysical masses for up, down, and strange quarks. For three massless flavors, on the other hand, the\nphase transition is known to be first order. Thus, if we take the nonstrange and strange quark masses as\ntwo independent variables, there is a critical line in the mud \u2212 ms plane, which separates the first-order\nregime at low masses from the crossover regime at higher masses (see right panel of Fig. 5). On this\nline, the phase transition is second order.\nWhen we now introduce the chemical potential as a third dimension, the critical line becomes a\ncritical surface. Until recently, it was generally expected that the critical surface is curved towards\nhigher masses, so that the real world, which is located in the crossover regime at \u03bc = 0, may enter the\nfirst-order regime above some critical value of \u03bc. A behavior like this is, for instance, seen in the NJL\nphase diagram of Fig. 3 and in many other model calculations. It is therefore often called the \"standard\nscenario\". There are, however, indications from the lattice for a \"non-standard scenario\", where the\ncritical surface is curved towards smaller masses [11]. If this was confirmed, it would mean that the real\nworld always stays in the crossover regime when \u03bc is increased. This by itself does not look unusual and\ncan be realized easily in NJL and PNJL models (see below). On the other hand, at very small quark\nmasses, where the phase transition is first order at \u03bc = 0, the non-standard scenario would have the\n5\n\n\f200\n\n200\n\ng\n\nD\n\n= g\n\n200\n\n180\n\nD0\n\ng\n\nD\n\nD0\n\n160\n\n140\n\n140\n\n140\n\n120\n\n120\n\n120\n\n80\n\nT [MeV]\n\n160\n\n100\n\n100\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n100\n\n150\n\n\u03bc\n\n[MeV]\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n= 0.2 g\n\nD0\n\n80\n\n60\n\n50\n\nD\n\n100\n\n60\n\n0\n\ng\n\n180\n\n= 0.6 g\n\n160\n\nT [MeV]\n\nT [MeV]\n\n180\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n\u03bc\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n0\n\n[MeV]\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n[MeV]\n\nFigure 4: Phase diagrams of the 3-flavor PNJL model for unphysically small current quark\nmasses mu = md = ms = 0.5 MeV and different values of the six-point coupling constant:\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\ngD = gD (left), gD = 0.6 gD (center), and gD = 0.2 gD (right). The solid and dotted lines\nindicate first-order phase transitions and crossovers, respectively.\n\ninteresting consequence that there is a first-order phase transition at low values of \u03bc which turns into a\ncrossover above some critical value \u03bc. Thus the question arises, whether such a \"reversed\" behavior is\nsomething really exotic or whether it can be realized in a simple model as well. In this context, it was\nrecently suggested by Fukushima that the non-standard scenario could be realized within a PNJL model\nif a \u03bc-dependent determinant interaction is introduced [12]. Below, we work out this idea explicitly.\nFollowing Ref. [12] we consider a three-flavor PNJL model, given by the Lagrangian\nL = \u03c8\u0304(iD\n/ \u2212 m\u0302)\u03c8 + L4 + L6 \u2212 U(\u03a6, \u03a6\u0304) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is a quark field which is coupled through the covariant derivative to the Polyakov loop. The\nterms L4 and L6 denote local 4-point and 6-point interactions, while U(\u03a6, \u03a6\u0304) is the Polyakov loop\npotential. Most details of these terms are not important for the following discussion and can be found in\nRef. [12]. At this point we just mention that L6 is a determinant in flavor space (\" 't Hooft interaction\"),\nwhich is proportional to a coupling constant gD .\nStarting with a physical parameter set [12] one finds a phase diagram which is qualitatively similar\nto Fig. 3, indicating that the model supports the standard scenario. In the next step we strongly\ndecrease the current quark masses to enter into the first-order regime at \u03bc = 0. The resulting phase\ndiagram for mu = md = ms = 0.5 MeV is shown in the left panel of Fig. 4. In this case, the phase\ntransition is first order everywhere. Next, we decrease the value of the determinant coupling from the\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\noriginal value gD to smaller values. The resulting phase diagrams for gD = 0.6 gD and gD = 0.2 gD\nare shown in the two other panels of Fig. 4. Obviously, with decreasing gD the first-order transition\nbecomes gradually replaced by a crossover and eventually disappears completely. However, in particular\nthe phase diagram in the center still looks \"normal\", with a first-order transition at higher \u03bc and a\ncrossover at lower \u03bc. Nevertheless, the series of phase diagram displayed in Fig. 4 shows that the\nreversed situation could be realized if we introduce a coupling which drops sufficiently fast with \u03bc [12].\nThis is explicitly demonstrated in the left part of Fig. 5, where we have chosen an exponentially dropping\n(0)\ncoupling constant, gD (\u03bc) = gD exp(\u2212\u03bc2 /\u03bc20 ). The constant \u03bc0 = 168 MeV was simply introduced by\nhand to see the desired effect and has no deeper meaning so far.\nAs argued above, the reversed form of the phase diagram shown in the left part of Fig. 5 is a hint\nfor a non-standard critical surface. This is confirmed by the results shown in the right part of Fig. 5,\nwhere the critical lines in the mud \u2212 ms plane are shown for \u03bc = 0, 100 MeV and 200 MeV. We see that\nthe critical surface is indeed curved towards lower masses in this case. This example demonstrates that\nthe non-standard scenario can be realized in a relatively simple model.

Of course, it remains to be investigated whether\nour parameterization of gD (\u03bc) makes sense also quantitatively. Furthermore, we should introduce a\nT -dependence of gD as well. In fact, this could have the opposite effect.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis talk was partially based on common work with D. Blaschke, M.K. Volkov, and J.
