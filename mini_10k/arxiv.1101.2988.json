[1]. They studied\nthe fidelity of teleportation between relative accelerated partners. Afterwards, a number of authors\nhave focused on the topic of the quantum information in a relativistic setup [2-8]. Schuller et al.\n[9] have studied how the Unruh effect changes the degree of quantum entanglement. However,\nall the investigations in non-inertial frames were confined to the studies of quantum information\nin an isolated system except [10, 11], where the authors have analyzed the decoherence effects in\nnon-inertial frames.\nSince in a realistic quantum system, the interaction between the quantum system and the\nsurrounding environment is inevitable, it is therefore, important to study the effect of environmental\ninfluences on the entanglement dynamics of a system. Quantum channels can be implemented by\n\n\f2\nsuitable quantum devices consisting of intrinsic degrees of freedom associated with the environment\nand acting on the system via particular interactions between the system and the environment. The\nassumption that noise is uncorrelated between successive uses of a channel is not realistic. Hence\nmemory effects need to be taken into account. Quantum channels with memory [12-14] are the\nnatural theoretical framework for the study of any noisy quantum communication system where\ncorrelation time is longer than the time between consecutive uses of the channel. A more general\nmodel of a quantum channel with memory was introduced by Bowen and Mancini [15] and also\nstudied by Kretschmann and Werner [16].\nIn this paper, we investigate the effect of quantum memory on the entanglement of Dirac fields\nin non-inertial frames. We consider the amplitude damping, depolarizing, phase flip and bit-phase\nflip channels. We assume that two observers, Alice and Rob, share an entangled initial state at\nthe same point in flat Minkowski spacetime. After that Alice stays stationary while Rob moves\nwith uniform acceleration. We assume that Alice and Rob have detectors that are sensitive only\nto their respective modes and both the observers share the following maximally entangled initial\nstate\n1\n|\u03a8iAR = \u221a (|0iA |0iR + |1iA |1iR )\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the two modes of Minkowski spacetime that correspond to Alice and Rob are |\u03b7iA and |\u03b7iR\nrespectively. From the perspective of Rob, the Minkowski vacuum is found to be a two-mode\nsqueezed state [4]\n|0iM = cos r|0iI |0iII + sin r|1iI |1iII\n\n(2)\n\nwhere cos r = (e\u22122\u03c0\u03c9c/a + 1)\u22121/2 . The constants \u03c9, c and a, in the exponential stand for Dirac\nparticle's frequency, light's speed in vacuum and Rob's acceleration respectively. The subscripts\nI and II of the kets represent the Rindler modes in region I and II, respectively, in the Rindler\nspacetime diagram (see Ref. [10], Fig. (1)). The excited state in Minkowski spacetime is related\nto Rindler modes as follows [4]\n|1iM = |1iI |0iII\n\n(3)\n\nUsing equations (2) and (3), equation (1) can be written in terms of Minkowski modes for Alice\nand Rindler modes for Rob as\n1\n|\u03a8iA,I,II = \u221a (cos r|0iA |0iI |0iII | + sin r|0iA |1iI |1iII + |1iA |1iI |0iII )\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\nSince Rob is causally disconnected from region II, therefore, by tracing over all the modes in region\nII leaves the following mixed density matrix between Alice and Rob\n\u03c1A,I =\n\n\u0001\n1\ncos2 r|00i h00| + cos r(|00i h11| + |11i h00|) + sin2 r|01i h01| + |11i h11|\n2\n\n(5)\n\nWe study the entanglement of Dirac fields in non-inertial frames influenced by different memory\nchannels, such as amplitude damping, depolarizing, phase flip and bit-phase-flip channels, parameterized by decoherence parameter p and memory parameter \u03bc. Here p \u2208 [0, 1] and \u03bc \u2208 [0, 1]\nrepresent the lower and upper limits of decoherence parameter and memory parameter respectively. It is seen that depolarizing channel influences the entanglement of Dirac fields heavily in\ncomparison to the amplitude damping and flipping channels. Therefore, the entanglement of Dirac\nfields is strongly dependent on degree of correlations of the noisy channels.\n\nII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT IN A CORRELATED ENVIRONMENT\n\nSince noise is a major hurdle while transmitting quantum information from one party to other\nthrough classical and quantum channels. This noise causes a distortion of the information sent\nthrough the channel. If multiple uses of a channel are not correlated, there is no advantage in using\nentangled states. Correlated noise, also referred as memory in the literature, acts on consecutive\nuses of the channel. However, in general, one may want to encode classical data into entangled\nstrings or consecutive uses of the channel may be correlated to each other. Hence, we are dealing\nwith a strongly correlated quantum system, the correlation of which results from the memory of\nthe channel itself. In Ref. [12], a Pauli channel with partial memory was studied. The action of\nsuch a channel on two consecutive qubits is given in Kraus operator form as\nAij =\n\nq\n\npi [(1 \u2212 \u03bc)p\u03b1j + \u03bc\u03b4 ij ]\u03c3 i \u2297 \u03c3 j\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 i (\u03c3 j ) are usual Pauli matrices, pi (pj ) represent the quantum noise and indices i and j runs\nfrom 0 to 3. The above expression means that with probability \u03bc the channel acts on the second\nqubit with the same error operator as on the first qubit, and with probability (1 \u2212 \u03bc) it acts on\nthe second qubit independently. Physically the parameter \u03bc is determined by the relaxation time\nof the channel when a qubit passes through it. In order to remove correlations, one can wait until\nthe channel has relaxed to its original state before sending the next qubit, however this lowers the\nrate of information transfer. Thus it is necessary to consider the performance of the channel for\narbitrary values of \u03bc to reach a compromise between various factors which determine the final rate\n\n\f4\nof information transfer. Thus in passing through the channel any two consecutive qubits undergo\nrandom independent (uncorrelated) errors with probability (1 \u2212 \u03bc) and identical (correlated) errors\nwith probability \u03bc. This should be the case if the channel has a memory depending on its relaxation\ntime and if we stream the qubits through it. A detailed list of single qubit Kraus operators for\ndifferent quantum channels with uncorrelated noise is given in table 1. The action of such a channel\nif n qubits are streamed through it, can be described in operator sum representation as [17]\n\u03c1f =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(Akn \u2297 .....Ak1 )\u03c1in (A\u2020k1 \u2297 .....A\u2020kn )\n\n(7)\n\nk1, ....,.kn=0\n\nwhere \u03c1in represents the initial density matrix for quantum state and Akn are the Kraus operators\nexpressed in equation (6). The Kraus operators satisfy the completeness relation\nn\u22121\nX\n\nA\u2020kn Akn = 1\n\n(8)\n\nkn =0\n\nHowever, the Kraus operators for a quantum amplitude damping channel with correlated noise are\ngiven by Yeo and Skeen [13] as given as\n\uf8ee\ncos \u03c7 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n1\nAc00 = \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef0\n0\n\uf8f0\n0\n0\n\n0 0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8fa\n1 0\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n0 1\n\nAc11\n\n0\n\n0 0 0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n=\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nsin \u03c7 0 0 0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, 0 \u2264 \u03c7 \u2264 \u03c0/2 and is related to the quantum noise parameter as\nsin \u03c7 =\n\n\u221a\n\np\n\n(10)\n\nIt is clear that Ac00 cannot be written as a tensor product of two two-by-two matrices. This gives\nrise to the typical spooky action of the channel: |01i and |10i, and any linear combination of them,\nand |11i will go through the channel undisturbed, but not |00i . The action of this non-unital\nchannel is given by\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c1 = \u03a6(\u03c0) = (1 \u2212 \u03bc)\n\n1\nX\n\nAuij \u03c0Au\u2020\nij + \u03bc\n\ni,j=0\n\n1\nX\n\nAckk \u03c0Ac\u2020\nkk\n\n(11)\n\nk=0\n\nThe action of the super-operators provides a way of describing the evolution of quantum states\nin a noisy environment. In our scheme, the Kraus operators are of the dimension 22 . They\nare constructed from single qubit Kraus operators by taking their tensor product over all n2\ncombinations\nAk = \u2297 Akn\nkn\n\n(12)\n\n\f5\nwhere n is the number of Kraus operator for a single qubit channel. The final state of the system\nafter the action of the channel can be obtained as\n\u03c1f = \u03a6p,\u03bc(\u03c1A,I )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03a6p,\u03bc is the super-operator realizing the quantum channel parametrized by real numbers p\nand \u03bc.

It can be easily checked from equations\n(20-23) that the concurrence becomes cos r if we set p = \u03bc = 0, which reproduces the results of\nRef. [4]. Similarly the results of Ref [10-11] can be reproduced by setting \u03bc = 0.\n\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have computed the mathematical relations for concurrence in case of amplitude damping,\ndepolarizing, phase flip and bit-phase flip channels. However, due to very lengthy mathematical\nexpressions, we have only plotted it for different parameters such as p, r, \u03bc respectively.\nIn figures 1 and 2, we plot the concurrence as a function of memory parameter \u03bc for different\nvalues of Rob's acceleration, r for decoherence parameter p = 0.5 for amplitude damping, depolarizing channels respectively. In figures 3 and 4, we plot the concurrence as a function of memory\nparameter \u03bc with others parameters similar as in figures 1 and 2 for bit-phase flip and phase flip\nchannels respectively. It is seen that quantum memory enhances the entanglement of Dirac fields\nin contrast to the effect of decoherence. It is also seen that the depolarizing channel influences\nthe entanglement more heavily in comparison to the other channels. The depolarizing channel\nenhances the degree of entanglement upto 1 even with 50% decoherence (see figure 2). It is clear\nfrom figure 3 that for lower values of memory parameter, the decoherence dominates and ESD\nbehaviour can be seen. However for higher values of memory, the ESD can also be avoided for\nflipping channels (see figures 3 and 6).\nIn figure 5, we plot the concurrence as a function of Rob's acceleration r for p = \u03bc = 0.5\nfor amplitude damping, depolarizing, bit-phase flip and phase flip channels. It is seen that the\nentanglement degradation is controlled due to the presence of quantum memory even at 50%\ndecoherence. It is also seen that entanglement is heavily degraded by amplitude damping channel\nas compared to other channels. In figure 6, we plot the concurrence as a function of decoherence\nparameter p for \u03bc = 0.5 and r = \u03c0/6 for amplitude damping, depolarizing, bit-phase flip and\nphase flip channels. It is seen that the maximum entanglement degradation occurs for amplitude\ndamping channel as compared to other channels. Furthermore, the symmetric behaviour of flipping\n\n\f10\nchannels is seen with maximum degradation for 50% decoherence. In order to check the validity of\nour calculations, we plot in figure 7, the concurrence as a function of decoherence parameter p for\n\u03bc = 0 and r = \u03c0/10 for amplitude damping, depolarizing, bit-phase flip and phase flip channels. It\nis seen that the maximum entanglement degradation occurs for bit-phase flip channel as compared\nto other channels. It is clear from the figure that the graphs of Ref. [10, 11] are reproduced in the\nabsence of memory.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe study the effect of quantum memory in non-inertial frames for amplitude damping,\ndepolarizing, phase flip and bit-phase flip channels. It is shown that the entanglement of initial\nstate is heavily influenced by quantum correlations. It is seen that quantum memory compensates\nthe loss of entanglement generated by the Unruh effect and decoherence. It is interesting to\nnote that the sudden death of entanglement disappears for any acceleration for higher degree of\nmemory. Furthermore, the entanglement of Dirac fields increases as we increase the degree of\nmemory. In conclusion, we can say that quantum memory can avoid ESD caused by Unruh effect\nfor all the channels considered.\n\n[1] P. M. Alsing and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 180404 (2003).\n[2] A.
