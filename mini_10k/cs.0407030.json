In addition, the search for an optimal schedule normally leads to very\ndifficult problems (NP-hard problems in the complexity theoretical sense), which\ncannot be solved efficiently.\nWith the intent to minimize these problems, the introduced heuristic method combines standard scheduling methods with fuzzy methods to get a nearly optimal\nschedule within an appropriate time considering vagueness adequately.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nScheduling is a fundamental part of production planning and control. The\ntask of scheduling is the allocation of activities over time to limited resources,\nwhere a number of conditions must be preserved. Resources represent objects,\nwhich can be allocated by activities. Using ordered sequences of activities,\nbasic production flows can be specified. These sequences, which are mainly\npredetermined by technical or organizational requirements, are specified by\njobs. Jobs can also specify supplementary conditions, as for example deadlines. In manufacturing, a job usually models an order.\n\n2\n\nBasic Approaches\n\nBefore the method presented in this paper is sketched, the fundamental basic\napproaches are considered which led to its development.\nAt first, reasons for conceptualizing the method as heuristic are given (Section 2.1). After showing that the consideration and processing of vague data,\nconditions and objectives are necessary (Section 2.2), it is shown how the integration of such information can by achieved in a common way (Section 2.3).\nUsing this potential, it is also possible to integrate varying, partly vague conditions into the scheduling process (Section 2.4). Based on this possibility of\nintegration, allocation recommendations can be derived (Section 2.5) which\ncan be finally transferred into an allocation decision (Section 3.6).\n\n\f2\n\n2.1\n\nWolfgang Anthony Eiden\n\nUsage of a heuristic method\n\nNowadays, many manufacturing industries are confronted with large variety\nin jobs and activities whose processing can be very complex to coordinate\nor schedule. In practice, the determination of optimal schedules normally\nleads to NP-hard problems in the complexity theoretical sense, for which\nno efficient algorithms are known [3]. Nevertheless the theoretically optimal\nschedule has mostly only a short time of validity [5].\nConsidering the cost-benefit calculation, it is advisable to use a heuristic\nmethod generating an approximately optimal schedule in appropriate time.\n2.2\n\nThe necessity for integration of vagueness\n\nThe considered input variables and parameters in scheduling \u2013 such as times,\nlengths of times, quantities and restrictions \u2013 usually possess an inherent\nvagueness [5]. Often, sharpened data is not available or can only be expensively acquired. In addition, dependences between relevant variables are only\nknown approximately [2].\nAs a rule, there is a continuous transition between permissible and nonpermissible conditions [8]. Frequently this fact is ignored. Instead vague data\nor conditions are often sharpened artificially. However, artificial sharpening\nof data or conditions should usually be advised against. An artificial sharpening leads sometimes to a distorted image of the reality. In the worst case\nthis leads even to a complete loss of reality [6]. Since it is closer to reality,\nthe consideration of vague information is better than the consideration of\nartificial sharpened information.\nAs logical consequence, it is necessary to integrate the vagueness of naturally\nvague information into the scheduling process.\n2.3\n\nIntegration of vagueness with fuzzy methods\n\nNaturally vague information conveys in their basic form (but also in a nearly\nbasic form) a more exact conceivability of its accuracy than in an artificially\nsharpened form. It usually can be assumed that the scheduling results will be\nmore realistic when using information with a form as close to its basic form\nas possible [8].\nA computer-aided interpretation and processing is only attainable if the underlying modeling and processing are both well defined and equally suitable\nfor sharp and for vague information. Vagueness must be processed precisely.\nFor this reason, both the modeling language and the kind of processing must\nbe from a strictly mathematical nature. As a premise, both high comprehensibility and transparency of decision must be ensured [5].\nIn this context, the fuzzy set theory is particularly suitable. With the fuzzy\nset theory it is possible to map and precisely process both sharp information\nand not exact quantifiable information (and vague information respectively)\nin a uniform way [5].\n\n\fScheduling with Fuzzy Methods\n\n2.4\n\n3\n\nIntegration of varying, partly vague, basic conditions and\nobjectives\n\nScheduling processes are subjected to varying, partly vague conditions and\nobjectives. It concerns production internal conditions as well as production\nexternal conditions. For instance, job- and resource-specific conditions (production internal conditions) are regarded as well as politically and strategically characterized conditions (production external conditions).\nA fundamental approach of the presented method is to provide a possibility to integrate the varying, partly vague, basic conditions directly into the\nscheduling process and therefore to minimize manual intervention.\nFor this purpose, it is necessary to interlink the context relevant conditions\nadequately and to use them as a decision basis whenever decisions must be\nmade in the scheduling process.\nThe fuzzy theory offers the possibility to put that into practice using fuzzy\napproximate reasoning methods \u2013 as for instance the fuzzy decision support\nsystem of Rommelfanger and Eickemeier [9]. With this method, it is possible\nto map and precisely process sharp information and not exact quantifiable\ninformation (and vague information respectively) \u2013 such as data, conditions\nand assessments \u2013 in a uniform way [5].\nHuman decision-making processes can also be integrated into the scheduling\nprocess. The feature of human decision-making processes is to get a good solution even if the decision circumstances are complex or poorly structured [10].\nThat applies also if the underlying information is incomplete, vague or even\ncontradictory [11].\nOn account of these possibilities, varying, partly vague, basic conditions and\nobjectives can be uniformly integrated into the scheduling process independently of their degree of vagueness. In this way, it is guaranteed that their\nsubstantial influence also appears in the scheduling process.\n\n2.5\n\nUsage of resource-specific and resource-comprehensive\nrecommendations for allocations\n\nThe allocation of a job is performed by allocation of all its activities to resources \u2013 and thereby, the conditions must be considered.\nA fundamental idea of the presented method is to keep up a greatest possible\ndegree of flexibility as long as possible to be able to generate an approximately optimal schedule.\nThe approach is to first determine the resource-specific optimal sequence of\nall activities to be allocated. In doing so, a detailed perception of the preferred allocation sequence of every resource is gained. Equipped with this\ninformation, resource-comprehensive recommendations for allocations can be\ndetermined. After all, an explicit allocation decision can be derived from these\nrecommendations.\n\n\f4\n\nWolfgang Anthony Eiden\n\nWhile determining the recommendations (both the resource-specific recommendations and the resource-comprehensive recommendations), the conditions and objectives described in Section 2.4 must be considered. Since these\nconditions and objectives can be handled by fuzzy methods in an adequate\nmanner, it is advisable to also determine the recommendations with fuzzy\nmethods.\n\n3\n\nThe method for scheduling under vagueness\n\nBased on the fundamental approaches previously discussed, the initial idea\nfor the following new method was developed. The purpose of this method is\nto get a nearly optimal schedule within an appropriate time considering the\nvagueness in the scheduling process adequately. The method itself is designed\niteratively using a rolling allocation decision mechanism (see figure 1).\nSince a specific activity is in the following always clearly assigned to a job,\na job is an outer wrapper of its activities specifying activity-comprehensive\nconditions.\n\nStart\n\n1\n\nGeneration of a rough temporal\nrelative arrangement of activities\n\n2\n\nTime window based selection\n\n3\n\nJob-oriented prioritization of\nactivities\n\n4\n\nActivity-orientated resource-specific\nrecommendations for allocations\n\n5\n\nResource-comprehensive\nrecommendations for allocations\n\n6\n\nPartial allocation\n\nStop\n\nFig. 1. The scheduling method (Overview)\n\n\fScheduling with Fuzzy Methods\n\n3.1\n\n5\n\nGeneration of a rough temporal relative arrangement of\nactivities\n\nStarting from the jobs and their activities to be allocated, a rough temporal\nrelative arrangement of activities is generated. The generation of this arrangement is based on a fuzzy version of a retrograde scheduling method1 . In\nliterature, a retrograde scheduling method is sometimes also called backward\nscheduling method.\nWith this method, the course of scheduling occurs contrary to the technological course; starting from the deadline of a job, the latest possible allocation\nof its activities is realized [7]. Since dates, times, and duration of times are\noften vague, the retrograde scheduling method is extended to be capable of\nhandling fuzzy representations of these temporal parameters.\nThe generated rough temporal relative arrangement is used as optimized input for the following time window based selection.\n3.2\n\nTime window based selection\n\nStarting from the generated rough temporal relative arrangement of the activities to be scheduled, the activities, which should be considered in a forwardshifted horizon of fixed size, are taken into account by a time window based\nselection. In this way, a quantitative restriction of the activities observed by\nthe succeeding steps of the method is performed.\nThis way of proceeding is ostensibly comparable with the load-oriented order\nrelease scheduling method, but the concept is different. The load-oriented\norder release scheduling method is based on the proposition, that a reduction\nof the average machining time is only possible with a lowering of the average\nquantity of the prior activity queue; the presented method uses the time window based selection only to reduce the complexity of the succeeding steps.\nUsually, no complete jobs are represented by the time window based selection of activities. However, manufacturing is primarily job-oriented. For this\nreason, the list of the selected activities is extended with all unscheduled activities assigned either to the same jobs as the activities picked up by the\ntime window based selection or to only partial allocated jobs of a prior run.\nIn this way, a list of activities is generated which contains all unscheduled activities of jobs which are referenced either by the time window based selection\nor by a prior run.\n3.3\n\nJob-oriented prioritization of activities\n\nConsidering job-specific and comprehensive conditions, all activities of the\nactivity list generated in the previous step are prioritized. Amongst other\n1\n\nFor detailed information about the retrograde termination method, please see [11]\nor [1].\n\n\f6\n\nWolfgang Anthony Eiden\n\nthings, the activities belonging to important jobs are emphasized in contrast\nto activities of less important jobs. The prioritization is made by a fuzzy rating method basing on the fuzzy decision support system introduced by Rommelfanger and Eickemeier [9].

Rating method based on a fuzzy decision support system\n\nThe priorities assigned to the activities induce a partial order. This partial ordered activity list is used as an initial list for the following activity-orientated\nresource-specific allocation recommendations.\n3.4\n\nActivity-orientated resource-specific recommendations for\nallocations\n\nConsidering the given partial order as much as possible, the activities given\nby the partial ordered activity list are prioritized resource-specific. In order to\nprovide an evaluation process, the method for the resource-specific allocation\nrecommendation also pays attention to several recently scheduled activities.\nFor this purpose, overlapping resource-specific time windows are used within\nthe rolling planning process. The activities given by the partial ordered activity list and any recently scheduled activities to consider are aggregated to\na new activity list which is then prioritized resource-specific by a fuzzy rating\nmethod.\n\n\fScheduling with Fuzzy Methods\n\n7\n\nIf an activity cannot be allocated by a specific resource, it is not a member of\nthe corresponding resource-specific activity list to be prioritized; if an activity can be allocated by several resources it is a member of all corresponding\nactivity lists but usually with different priorities depending on the specific\nresource. Thereby, the resource-specific situation and conditions are considered as well as comprehensive conditions, hard restrictions and objectives.\nIn doing so, a detailed perception of the preferred allocation sequence of every resource is gained. In this way, resource-specific allocation recommendations can be derived. Equipped with this information, an optimized resourcecomprehensive recommendation for allocations can be determined.\n3.5\n\nResource-comprehensive recommendations for allocations\n\nFrom the resource-comprehensive viewpoint the resource-specific allocation\nrecommendations generated in the last step are not necessarily redundancyfree. The corresponding ordered lists may contain activities which are elements of above one of these lists. Since every activity must be allocated at\nmost one time, a method for redundancy removal is accomplished. Thereby,\nthe consideration of the outer conditions (the strategic conditions in particular) is guaranteed by a fuzzy rating method.\nIn order to achieve a preferably balanced utilization simultaneously, a rolling\nallocation rating process is employed, which use resource-specific time windows. This rating process will be repeated until no changes or no more significant changes will occur. In doing so, resource-comprehensive recommendations for an allocation are derived for every resource. These recommendations\nare limited by the resource-specific sliding time windows.\n3.6\n\nAllocation and Continuation\n\nThe resource-comprehensive allocation recommendations determined in the\nlast step are transformed to allocation determinations for the considered activities. Subsequently, the allocations are performed.\nAfterwards, all activities that are not allocated are brought into a further\nscheduling process again. Thereby, all allocated activities are no longer considered in the further scheduling process; if all activities of a job are allocated,\nthis applies also to the corresponding job. In this way, the final schedule containing all activities and jobs is constructed step-by-step.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, a new method was presented, which integrates the vagueness\nof naturally vague information in specified shape into the scheduling process\nconsidering varying, partly vague, basic conditions and conditions.\nIt was shown how it is possible to integrate that important, but usually hardly\n\n\f8\n\nWolfgang Anthony Eiden\n\nused, source of information using the fuzzy theory and the techniques developed from it. It was also shown the possibility of the integration of human\ndecision and human assessment processes into the scheduling process.\nBy the conscious use of vague information and the avoidance of over specification, even a complexity reduction can be achieved [6]. For not going beyond\nthe scope of this paper, the approach of self-organizing activities [4] was not\nconsidered.\n\nReferences\n1. Adam, D.
