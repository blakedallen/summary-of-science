Electron-electron (e-e) interactions\ndrive the 1D system into a non-Fermi liquid state known\nas the Luttinger liquid (LL) (for review see, e.g., Refs. 1,\n2,3,4,5,6,7). In recent years, progress in nanofabrication\ntechnologies has made it possible to manufacture a variety of single- and few-channel quantum wires connected\nto the electric leads and to perform systematic transport measurements on the very narrow wires. The latter include single\u2013wall carbon nanotubes8,9,10,11,12,13,14 ,\nsemiconductor-based15,16,17,18 and metallic19 quantum\nwires, polymer nanofibers20 , as well as quantum Hall\nedge states.21,22 The LL nature of these strongly correlated quantum wires has been supported by a wealth of\nexperimental findings.8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,19,20,21,22 Another class of strongly-correlated quantum wires that has\nrecently attracted a lot of interest is ultracold atomic\ngases confined to 1D geometry, for review see Ref. 23.\nMesoscopic physics of strongly correlated electrons is\none of the most important and promising directions of\ncurrent research on 1D electron systems. Recent transport measurements on carbon nanotubes24 reported both\nsample-dependent conductance fluctuations and strong\nmagnetoconductivity, in qualitative similarity to the\nmesoscopic phenomena in higher-dimensional disordered\nelectron systems. In Ref. 24, the sample size \u223c 1 \u03bcm\nwas of the order of the mean free path limited by impurity scattering. Electron transport through the nanotubes displayed, therefore, features characteristic of\n\nthe crossover from ballistic conduction to a disorderdominated regime. On the other hand, in the past few\nyears techniques to grow nanotubes of size up to the millimeter scale25,26 -much larger than the typical value of\nthe disorder-induced mean free path-have been developed. First transport measurements25,26 on the ultralong nanotubes provided evidence for disorder-induced\ndiffusive motion of electrons in a wide range of temperature. Altogether, these advances have paved the way for\nsystematic experimental study of interference-induced localization phenomena in 1D.\nThe theory of weak localization (WL) in a disordered\nLL of spinless electrons was developed in Refs. 27 and\n28 (for recent advances in the ballistic \u03c3-model framework, see also Ref. 29). In the limit of weak interaction between electrons, the phase breaking length l\u03c6 that\nsets up the infrared cutoff of WL was shown to obey\nl\u03c6 \u223c \u03b1\u22121 (lT l)1/2 , where \u03b1 \u226a 1 is the dimensionless interaction constant, lT \u223c v/T the thermal length, v the\nFermi velocity, T the temperature, l the elastic mean free\npath. At sufficiently high temperatures, when l\u03c6 \u226a l,\nthe system is in the WL regime.30 The WL correction\n\u2206\u03c3WL to the Drude conductivity \u03c3D behaves then as\n\u2206\u03c3WL /\u03c3D \u223c \u2212(l\u03c6 /l)2 ln(l/l\u03c6 ) \u223c \u2212\u03b1\u22122 (lT /l) ln(\u03b12 l/lT ).\nNote that the WL dephasing length of spinless electrons\noriginates from the interplay of interaction and disorder:\nboth ingredients are necessary to establish a nonzero dephasing rate. As a result, l\u03c6 in the WL regime is much\nlonger than the total decay length of fermionic excitations\nlee \u223c \u03b1\u22122 lT . The latter is the dephasing length relevant\nto the damping of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations27,28,31,32\nand to the smearing of a zero-bias anomaly in the tunnelling density of states.33\n\n\f2\nIn a spinful LL, the most prominent spin-related manifestation of non-Fermi liquid physics is a phenomenon of\nspin-charge separation (SCS) (see, e.g., Refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,\n7). The essence of the SCS in the LL model is that the\nspin and charge sectors of the theory in a bosonic representation are completely decoupled from each other and\ncharacterized by different interaction coupling constants.\nCorrespondingly, the elementary bosonic excitations carrying spin and charge propagate with different velocities, independently of each other. Experimentally, the\neffect of the SCS on the spectral properties of a LL (as\nmeasured in electron tunnelling experiments) has been\nstudied in Refs. 15,17. In the last few years, much attention has been given to the so-called \"spin-incoherent\nregime\"34 in 1D systems with strongly different spin and\ncharge velocities.35,36,37 For recent transport measurements in ballistic quantum wires which show signatures\nof the spin-incoherent behavior, see Ref. 18 and references therein.\nWhile the difference in the spectral properties of spin\nand charge collective modes is not at all specific to 1D\nand is also characteristic of higher-dimensional Fermi\nliquids,38 the peculiarity of 1D is that the \"factorization\" of the bosonic modes modifies the single-particle\nfermionic properties in an essential way.39 Our purpose\nis to investigate how the SCS affects the quantum interference phenomena in a disordered LL. In particular, we\nanalyze the dynamical properties of fermionic excitations\nat finite temperature and employ the results of this analysis to calculate the WL correction to the conductivity\nof a spinful LL. The problem is rather nontrivial conceptually since the spin and charge degrees of freedom\nthat constitute the electron in a LL acquire different velocities and the very notion of a specific quasiclassical\nelectron trajectory characterized by a certain velocity-\nconventionally invoked in a description of WL-becomes\nambiguous.\nWe show below that, despite the intricate nature of\na single-electron motion in a spinful LL, the basic notions of WL remain applicable even when the SCS is\nincorporated in the calculation. However, the spin degree of freedom has dramatic consequences for the effects\nof e-e scattering. Most importantly, the decay rate of\nfermionic excitations is strongly enhanced in the presence\nof spin: the single-particle length lee \u223c \u03b1\u22121 lT becomes\nparametrically shorter than for spinless (spin-polarized)\nelectrons. Moreover, in contrast to the spinless case, the\nWL dephasing length l\u03c6 \u223c \u03b1\u22121 lT becomes of the order of lee . As a result, also the WL dephasing turns\nout to be much stronger than without the SCS being\nincluded. The temperature at which spinful electrons\nget strongly localized (lT /l \u223c \u03b1) is therefore much lower\n(for small \u03b1) than for spinless electrons. Furthermore,\nwe find that the WL correction to the conductivity is\ngiven by \u2206\u03c3WL /\u03c3D \u223c \u2212(l\u03c6 /l)2 \u223c \u2212\u03b1\u22122 (lT /l)2 , showing\na much faster temperature dependence of \u2206\u03c3WL than in\nthe spinless case.\nWe also demonstrate that a classical \"memory effect\"\n\n(ME) in the electron scattering off disorder contributes to\nthe T dependence of the conductivity. Moreover, it gives\nthe leading (larger than \u2206\u03c3WL ) correction to the Drude\nconductivity in the limit of high T . The obtained ME\ncontribution \u2206\u03c3ME /\u03c3D \u223c \u2212lT /l is essentially not related\nto e-e interactions and exceeds \u2206\u03c3WL only when the latter is sufficiently suppressed by the interaction-induced\ndephasing. Specifically, |\u2206\u03c3ME | \u226b |\u2206\u03c3WL | for lT /l \u226a \u03b12\n(i.e., for l\u03c6 /l \u226a \u03b1). Otherwise, |\u2206\u03c3WL | \u226b |\u2206\u03c3ME |.\nTechnically, the ME manifests itself in the same set of\nFeynman diagrams for the conductivity as the WL, so\nthat we actually treat the two effects-the essentially\nclassical ME and the essentially quantum WL-on an\nequal footing. What distinguishes them from each other\nis that the main contributions to \u2206\u03c3WL and \u2206\u03c3ME come\nfrom scattering on different impurity configurations. The\nWL correction stems from scattering on rare, compact\nthree-impurity complexes in which the characteristic distance between all three impurities is of the order of the\nsingle-particle length lee . The ME correction is associated with impurity configurations in which two of impurities are located very close to each other, with a characteristic distance between them of the order of the thermal\nlength lT .\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In\nSec. II we formulate the model of a disordered LL, discuss\nthe basic physics of the SCS relevant to the e-e scattering,\nand describe the method of functional bosonization used\nin our calculation. Section III is devoted to an analysis of\nthe spectral properties of fermionic excitations in various\nrepresentations; in particular, in a \"space-energy representation\" employed for the calculation of the conductivity. In Secs. IV and V we evaluate the WL and ME corrections to the conductivity, respectively, by means of the\nfunctional bosonization method. In Sec. VI we present a\ncomplementary analysis based on the more conventional\npath-integral approach. Our results are summarized in\nSec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nWe begin by formulating the model of a disordered\nspinful LL in Sec. II A. In Sec. II B we present a simple\nargument which demonstrates the peculiarity of 1D geometry in that the spin degree of freedom affects the rate\nof e-e scattering in the LL in a crucial way. Section II C\nis devoted to an overview of the functional bosonization\nmethod.\n\nA.\n\nDisordered Luttinger liquid\n\nThroughout the paper we consider a single-channel infinite quantum wire. Linearizing the dispersion relation\nof electrons about two Fermi points at the wavevectors\nk = \u00b1kF with the velocity v, the Hamiltonian of a clean\n\n\f3\nLL is written as (~ = 1)\nHLL =\n\nX\nk\u03bc\u03c3\n\n+\n\nv(\u03bck \u2212 kF )\u03a8\u2020\u03bc\u03c3 (k)\u03a8\u03bc\u03c3 (k)\n\nZ\n\u0001\n1 X\ndx n\u03bc\u03c3 g4 n\u03bc\u03c3\u2032 + n\u03bc\u03c3 g2 n\u2212\u03bc,\u03c3\u2032 .\n2\n\u2032\n\u03bc\u03c3\u03c3\n\nwhere the backscattering amplitudes Ub (x) are correlated\nas hUb (x)Ub\u2217 (x\u2032 )i = hU (x)U (x\u2032 )i and hUb (x)Ub (x\u2032 )i = 0.\nForward scattering off impurities can be gauged out in\nthe calculation of the conductivity7,43 and will therefore\nbe neglected from the very beginning. The total Hamiltonian H that defines our model of a disordered spinful\nLL is thus\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere \u03a8\u03bc\u03c3 (k) are the electron operators at the wavevector\nk, the index \u03bc = \u00b1 denotes two branches of chiral excitations (right and left movers), and \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 stands for\ntwo spin projections. The e-e interaction enters Eq. (2.1)\nthrough the coupling constants g4 and g2 . These describe\nforward e-e scattering with small momentum transfer\n(much smaller than kF ) between electrons from the same\n(g4 ) or different (g2 ) chiral branches. We assume that the\ne-e interaction is short-ranged and represent the interaction part of the Hamiltonian in terms of the local in space\n\u2020\nelectron density operators n\u03bc\u03c3 (x) = \u03c8\u03bc\u03c3\n(x)\u03c8\u03bc\u03c3 (x). The\nparameters of the Hamiltonian with the linearized dispersion should be understood as effective (phenomenological) couplings of the low-energy theory, which include\npossible high-energy renormalization effects, similar to\nFermi-liquid theory.\nThe LL Hamiltonian (2.1) does not contain the term\nZ\n1 X\n\u2020\n\u2020\nHbs =\ndx \u03c8\u03bc\u03c3\n\u03c8\u2212\u03bc,\u03c3 g1 \u03c8\u2212\u03bc,\u03c3\n(2.2)\n\u2032 \u03c8\u03bc\u03c3 \u2032 ,\n2\n\u2032\n\u03bc\u03c3\u03c3\n\nwhich describes backward e-e scattering with large momentum transfer resulting in a change of chirality \u03bc. If\none begins with a microscopic model of electrons interacting via a finite-range externally screened Coulomb potential, the constants g2,4 in Eq. (2.1) and g1 in Eq. (2.2)\nare related to the Fourier transforms of this potential\nat zero and 2kF momenta, respectively. The forward\nscattering dominates provided that the radius of external\nscreening d (e.g., the distance to a metallic gate) is much\nlarger than kF\u22121 . We assume that this is the case and\nneglect Hbs throughout the paper below.40 Treating the\nCoulomb potential in Eq. (2.1) as short-ranged is legitimate for scattering processes with momentum transfer\nmuch smaller than d\u22121 . This same scale d\u22121 fixes the\nultraviolet momentum cutoff in our formulation of the\nlow-energy theory.\nThe only source of electron backscattering in our model\nis thus a static random potential U (x) due to the presence\nof impurities. We assume that fluctuations of U (x) are\nGaussian and characterized by the correlation function\nhU (x)U (x\u2032 )i = \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )v 2 /2l0 (\"white noise\").

The\nplasmon velocity u for the spinful case then reads\nu = v/K\u03c1 = v(1 + 2g/\u03c0v)1/2 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwith K\u03c1 being the Luttinger constant in the charge sector, whereas the velocity of elementary spin excitations is\nequal to v. It is convenient to characterize the strength of\ne-e interaction by the dimensionless coupling constant28\n\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 K\u03c12 )/(1 + 3K\u03c12 ), which in the limit of weak\ninteraction \u03b1 \u226a 1 is written as\n\u03b1 \u2243 (1 \u2212 K\u03c1 )/2 \u2243 g/2\u03c0v .\nB.\n\n(2.6)\n\nWhy spin matters\n\nTo qualitatively understand the nature of dephasing of\nfermionic excitations in a spinful LL, it is instructive to\nrecall the perturbative expansion6,27 of the self-energy of\nthe single-particle Green's function in the limit of weak\ninteraction \u03b1 \u226a 1 and discuss the e-e scattering rate at\nthe Golden-rule level, first in the absence of disorder. For\nthe spinless case, such an analysis has been performed\nin Refs. 27,28, and 32-see also Refs. 27,28,31,32 and\nRefs. 27,32 for a closely related calculation of the temporal decay of the single-particle Green's function for spinless and spinful electrons, respectively. Since the physics\nof dephasing is governed by inelastic e-e scattering, a natural first step is to calculate at lowest (second) order in\n\u22121\n\u03b1 the e-e scattering rate \u03c4ee\ngiven by the imaginary part\nof the self-energy.\nThe Golden-rule expression for the e-e collision rate\nreads\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nh\n= d\u03c9d\u03b5\u2032 K(\u03c9) f\u03b5\u2212\u03c9\nf\u03b5\u2032 f\u03b5h\u2032 +\u03c9 + f\u03b5\u2212\u03c9 f\u03b5h\u2032 f\u03b5\u2032 +\u03c9 ,\nGR (\u03b5)\n\u03c4ee\n(2.7)\nwhere\nH\nH\nK(\u03c9) = \u03b7s [ K++\n(\u03c9) + K+\u2212\n(\u03c9) ] + K F (\u03c9)\n\n(2.8)\n\nis the kernel of the e-e collision integral and f\u03b5 is the\nFermi distribution function, f\u03b5h = 1 \u2212 f\u03b5 . In Eq. (2.8),\nH\nH\nthe Hartree terms K++\n\u221d g42 and K+\u2212\n\u221d g22 are related\nto scattering of two electrons from the same (++) or difH\nferent (+\u2212) chiral branches, respectively, K F = \u2212K++\n\n\f4\nH\nis the exchange counterpart of K++\n, \u03b7s is the spin degeneracy, \u03b7s = 1 for the spinless case and \u03b7s = 2 for the\nspinful case.\nTo order O(\u03b12 ), the Golden-rule scattering rate and\nthe self-energy on the mass shell coincide with each other.\nAt the Fermi level (\u03b5 = 0) we have\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\nH\nF\n, (2.9)\n= \u22122 \u03b7s (Im\u03a3H\n++ + Im\u03a3+\u2212 ) + Im\u03a3\nGR\n\u03c4ee (0)\n\nwhere the Hartree terms are given by\nZ\n\u0010\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u0011\n\u03c0 2\n\u03b1\nv\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 coth\n\u2212 tanh\nIm\u03a3H\n=\n\u2212\n+\u00b1\n2\n2T\n2T\nZ\n\u00d7\ndq \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 vq)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2213 vq)\n(2.10)\n\nand the exchange term \u03a3F = \u2212\u03a3H\n++ . Peculiar to 1D are\nhighly singular contributions to K(\u03c9) related to scattering of electrons moving in the same direction. One\nsees that the contribution of \u03a3H\n++ contains a \u03b4-function\nsquared and thus diverges.6,27,28 The divergency of the\nperturbative expression for the probability of scattering\nof two electrons of the same chirality simply means that\nthe energy and momentum conservation laws for this kind\nof scattering give a single equation \u03c9 \u2212 vq = 0.\nFor spinless (spin-polarized) electrons, the divergency\nin Im\u03a3H\n++ is canceled by the same divergency in the ex27,28,32\nchange term. The remaining term Im\u03a3H\n+\u2212 yields\n1\n= \u03b12 \u03c0T .\nGR (0)\n\u03c4ee\n\n(2.11)\n\nNote that for scattering of electrons from different chiral branches on each other, the energy and momentum\nconservation laws lead to two equalities: \u03c9 \u2212 vq = 0 and\n\u03c9 +vq = 0, which combine to give \u03c9, q = 0 for allowed energy and momentum transfers. This \"quasi-elastic\"27,28\ncharacter of e-e scattering is a peculiarity of 1D: in higher\ndimensionalities, the characteristic energy transfer that\n\u22121\ndetermines \u03c4ee\nin a clean system is of order T .\nFor spinful electrons, the Fock contribution cancels\nonly the part of the Hartree term Im\u03a3H\n++ that comes\nfrom interaction between electrons with the same spin.\nThe divergent second-order Hartree term that arises from\ninteraction between electrons with opposite spins remains\nuncompensated. This indicates that the main contribu\u22121\ntion to \u03c4ee\nis now related to scattering of electrons from\nthe same chiral branch. Thus, already the perturbative\nexpansion demonstrates6,27,28 a qualitative difference between the cases of spinless and spinful electrons.\nIn fact, for spinful electrons, the perturbative expan\u22121\nsion of \u03c4ee\nin powers of \u03b1 is diverging in the clean limit\nat each order. We will analyze the finite-T damping of\nthe single-particle Green's function for \u03b1 \u226a 1 in Sec. III.\nGR\nHere, we stick to the calculation of 1/\u03c4ee\nwithin a \"generalized Golden-rule\" scheme. The term \"generalized\"\nmeans that we go beyond second order in \u03b1 by introducing the dynamically screened e-e interaction V (\u03c9, q)-\nwhich is exactly44 given by the random phase approximation (RPA) [see Eq. (2.25) below]. The second \u03b4-function\n\nin the integrand of Eq. (2.10) comes precisely from the\nimaginary part of the retarded propagator ImV (q, \u03c9) if\none takes the propagator at second order in \u03b1,\nImV (q, \u03c9) \u2243 \u2212(2\u03c0\u03b1)2 \u03c9v[ \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 vq) + \u03b4(\u03c9 + vq) ] .\n(2.12)\nUsing the full RPA propagator ImV (q, \u03c9) \u221d [ \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 uq) +\n\u03b4(\u03c9 + uq) ], the leading at \u03b1 \u226a 1 Golden-rule expression\nfor the e-e scattering rate of spinful electrons is written\nas\nZ\nZ\n1\n2\n\u2243\n2\u03c0\u03b1\nvT\nd\u03c9\ndq \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 vq)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 uq) , (2.13)\nGR (0)\n\u03c4ee\nwhich only differs from \u22122Im\u03a3H\n++ in Eq. (2.10) in that\none of the \u03b4-functions has a shifted velocity v \u2192 u. Note\nGR\nthat, similarly to the spinless case, 1/\u03c4ee\n(0) in Eq. (2.13)\nis determined by \u03c9, q = 0. The relative shift between the\narguments of the \u03b4-functions makes the expression for\nGR\n1/\u03c4ee\n(0) finite:\n1\nv\n\u2243 2\u03c0\u03b12 T\n\u2243 |\u03b1|\u03c0T ,\nGR (0)\n\u03c4ee\n|u \u2212 v|\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere we used Eq. (2.5) for u \u2212 v \u2243 2\u03b1v for small \u03b1.\nRemarkably, the e-e scattering rate for spinful electrons\nturns out to be of first order in \u03b1, in contrast to the\nspinless case (2.11), where it is of order \u03b12 .\nAs we will see below in a more consistent treatment\nwhich does not rely on the generalized Golden-rule apGR\nproach, the scattering rate 1/\u03c4ee\n(0) gives a characteristic decay rate for single-particle excitations and also the\ncharacteristic dephasing rate for WL. What the above\nconsideration teaches us is that in 1D the spin degree\nof freedom strongly enhances the e-e scattering rate for\nweakly interacting electrons. The parametric difference\nbetween the spinless and spinful cases is in stark contrast to higher dimensionalities, where taking spin into\naccount typically yields for relaxation rates in a clean\nsystem only numerical factors of order unity.\nC.\n\nFunctional bosonization\n\nThe method we use here to study the quantum interference in a disordered spinful LL is functional bosonization.\nIt was introduced for the clean LL model in Refs. 45,46\nand further developed in Refs. 47,48,49,50. In the earlier work27,28 by three of us, the functional bosonization\nframework was extended to deal with disordered problems and applied to study the transport properties of\na disordered spinless LL. In this subsection we present\na brief outline of the formalism (for more details see\nSec. VII in Ref. 28), highlighting the differences between\nthe spinless and spinful cases.\nIn contrast to \"full bosonization\", conventionally used\nfor a theoretical description of the LL, the functional\nbosonization technique preserves both fermionic (electrons) and bosonic (collective excitations \u2013 plasmons,\n\n\f5\nspinons) degrees of freedom.\nThis feature of the\nmethod is of great advantage when one has to deal\nwith interacting problems which are most naturally described in terms of fermionic excitations, e.g., quantum interference (Refs. 27,28 and the present work) or\nnonequlibrium33,51,52 phenomena in a LL. In particular, the functional bosonization allows for a straightforward treatment of e-e interaction while residing in the\nfermionic basis, which is especially cost-efficient in the\ndisordered case.\nThe key steps in setting up the formalism for a LL at\nthermal equilibrium are as follows:\n\u2022 a conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling of\nthe four-fermion interaction term in the Matsubara action is performed by means of introducing a\nbosonic field \u03c6(x, \u03c4 );\n\u2022 interaction of fermions with the field \u03c6 is gauged\nout by means of a local transformation (\u03bc = \u00b1)\n\u03c8\u03bc\u03c3 (x, \u03c4 ) \u2192 \u03c8\u03bc\u03c3 (x, \u03c4 ) exp [ i \u03b8\u03bc (x, \u03c4 )],\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere the phase \u03b8\u03bc (x, \u03c4 ) obeys\n(\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 i \u03bc v \u2202x ) \u03b8\u03bc (x, \u03c4 ) = \u03c6(x, \u03c4 ).\n\n(2.16)\n\nThis transformation completely eliminates the coupling between the fermionic and bosonic fields from\nthe action (this property is peculiar to 1D);\n\u2022 upon this transformation, the bosonic part of the\naction remains Gaussian. It is this point at which\nthe peculiarity of the LL model-the exactness of\nthe RPA-comes into play. The correlation function of the field \u03c6 is given by\nh\u03c6(x, \u03c4 )\u03c6(0, 0)i = V (x, \u03c4 ),\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere V (x, \u03c4 ) is the dynamically screened interaction [see Eq. (2.25) below];\n\u2022 an arbitrary time-ordered fermionic average is expressed through a product of free electron Green's\nfunctions and Gaussian averages of the phase factors exp[i\u03b8\u03bc (x, \u03c4 )] (taken at different space-time\npoints). The bosonic averages are represented in\nterms of the correlation functions\nB\u03bc\u03bd (x, \u03c4 ) = h [\u03b8\u03bc (0, 0) \u2212 \u03b8\u03bc (x, \u03c4 )] \u03b8\u03bd (0, 0) i\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhich are related to the Fourier component\nV (q, i\u03a9n ) of the interaction propagator (2.17) as\nX Z dq\n\u0001\nB+\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ) = T\neiqx\u2212i\u03a9n \u03c4 \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\nn\nV (q, i\u03a9n )\n,\n(vq \u2212 i\u03a9n )(\u00b1vq \u2212 i\u03a9n )\nB\u2212\u2212 (x, \u03c4 ) = B++ (\u2212x, \u03c4 ) ,\nB\u2212+ (x, \u03c4 ) = B+\u2212 (x, \u03c4 ) .\n\u00d7\n\n(2.19)\n\nHere \u03a9n = 2\u03c0nT is the bosonic Matsubara frequency;\n\u2022 while calculating observables (closed fermionic\nloops), e-e interaction is completely accounted\nfor by attaching the fluctuating gauge factors to\nbackscattering vertices. If the number of fermionic\nloops is larger than one, each of them has to contain\nat least one pair of backscattering vertices in order not to be disconnected (Wick's theorem for the\nfunctional bosonization diagrammatic technique).\n\ne\n\n-i\u03b8+(1)\n\ne\n\n+i\u03b8+(2)\n\ne-B++(x2-x1,\u03c42-\u03c41)\n\n+\n1\n\n+\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: The Green's function of a right mover propagating\nbetween space-time points 1 = (x1 , \u03c41 ) and 2 = (x2 , \u03c42 ) before (a) and after (b) averaging over fluctuations of the gauge\nfactors.

Upon\ngauge transformation (2.15), one gets the free Green's\nfunction g+ (x, \u03c4 ) dressed by two phase factors as shown\nin Fig. 1(a).

This\nshould be contrasted with the spinless case, where the\ndephasing of localization effects is absent altogether unless the disorder-induced damping of V (q, i\u03a9n ) is taken\ninto account27,28 (\"dirty RPA\").\nSubstituting Eq.

If \u03b1 \u226a 1, the first two cuts are much different from the third one. In the limit of small \u03b1, the cut\nthat connects the points \u03c4 = ix/u and ix/v corresponds\nto an almost square-root singularity, so that the main\nchange the Green's function experiences when crossing\nthis cut is a change of sign (\"strong cut\"). On the other\nhand, the cut that goes from \u2212ix/u to \u2212i\u221e is \"weak\" in\nthe sense that the discontinuity of G+ (x, \u03c4 ) across this\ncut is proportional to \u03b1b \u223c \u03b12 \u226a 1. Similarly, crossing the axis of imaginary \u03c4 between \u03c4 = ix/v and i\u221e is\nassociated with a weak discontinuity.\nThe main approximation we make in this paper consists in sending \u03b1b to zero everywhere in the calculation\nwhile keeping the effects of leading (linear) order in the\ninteraction strength. That is, below we retain the difference between u and v, Eq. (2.5),\nu \u2243 v(1 + 2\u03b1) ,\n\n\u03b1\u226a1,\n\n(3.3)\n\nas the only effect of e-e interaction.53 The Green's function G+ (x, \u03c4 ) then reads\nG+ (x, \u03c4 ) \u2243 \u2212\n\u00d7\n\n\u001a\n\ni\n\u221a\n2\u03c0 uv\n\n\u03c0T\n\u03c0T\nsinh[\u03c0T (x/v + i\u03c4 )] sinh[\u03c0T (x/u + i\u03c4 )]\n\n\u001b1/2\n\n.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe velocities u and v in Eq. (3.4) coincide with the velocities of the elementary collective excitations (plasmons\nand spinons). The appearance of the two velocities in the\nsingle-particle correlator signifies SCS. Within the approximation (3.4), the two velocities enter the fermionic\nGreen's function in a symmetric way. The analytical\nstructure of G+ (x, \u03c4 ) in Eq. (3.4) is simplified to a single\nsquare-root cut between the points \u03c4 = ix/u and ix/v,\nas illustrated in the center top panel of Fig. 4. We will\n\nFIG. 4: Left top panel: the analytical structure of the rightmover Green's function G+ (x, \u03c4 ) in the complex plane of the\nMatsubara time \u03c4 . The bold solid and the dashed lines represent \"strong\" and \"weak\" branch cuts, respectively [see the\ntext below Eq. (3.2)]. Central top panel: within the approximation (3.4), only the square-root branch cut between the\npoints \u03c4 = ix/u and ix/v survives. Last three panels: the\ncontour transformation used to calculate the Green's function in the space-energy representation in Sec. III B.\n\nuse the approximation (3.4), which captures the essential\nphysics of SCS, throughout the paper below.\nIt is instructive to compare Eq. (3.4) with the Green's\nfunction of spinless electrons Gsl\n+ (x, \u03c4 ) (see, e.g., Refs. 1,\n2,3,4,5,6,7,28). Since the correlator B++ (x, \u03c4 ) in the\nspinless case is twice as large, Gsl\n+ (x, \u03c4 ) is given by\nGsl\n+ (x, \u03c4 ) = \u2212\n\u00d7\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03c0T\ni\n2\u03c0u sinh[\u03c0T (x/u + i\u03c4 )]\n\n\u03c0T /\u039b\n\u03c0T /\u039b\nsinh[\u03c0T (x/u + i\u03c4 )] sinh[\u03c0T (x/u \u2212 i\u03c4 )]\n\n\u001b\u03b1b /2\n\n.\n\n(3.5)\n\nOne sees that in the absence of spin, interaction leads to\na replacement of the velocity v \u2192 u in the bare Green's\nfunction and generates two brunch cuts: one with an exponent close to 1 and the other with the small exponent\n\u03b1b /2. It follows that for spinless electrons the approximation \u03b1b \u2192 0, analogous to Eq. (3.4), would eliminate\nall dephasing effects-since the latter only originate from\nthe factors in the second line of Eq. (3.5). By contrast,\ndephasing in the spinful case arises already at order O(\u03b1),\nas will be shown below. Consequently, the approximation (3.4) allows us to obtain-in a controllable way-\nanalytical results valid in the limit \u03b1 \u226a 1.\nLet us now identify two important spatial scales. For\nthis purpose, we perform the Wick rotation \u03c4 \u2192 i(t + i0)\nin Eq. (3.4). For large |x/u\u2212t|, |x/v\u2212t| \u226b 1/T , Eq. (3.4)\nyields\nG+ (x, it) \u221d exp [\u2212\u03c0T (|x/u \u2212 t| + |x/v \u2212 t|) /2] . (3.6)\n\n\f8\nWithin the interval x/u < t < x/v, the Green's function\ngiven by Eq. (3.6) decays as\nG+ (x, it) \u221d exp (\u2212x/2lee ) ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nindependently of t, whereas outside this interval the\nGreen's function is suppressed much more strongly; in\nparticular, at t = 0:\nG+ (x, 0) \u221d exp (\u2212x/2lT ) ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nmerely due to the thermal smearing. Here we have introduced\nu\u2212\n(3.9)\nlee =\n2\u03c0T\nand\nlT =\n\nu+\n,\n2\u03c0T\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich are the length scale of spatial decay of fermionic excitations due to e-e interaction and the \"thermal smearing length\", respectively. The velocities u\u00b1 are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 1\n1\n.\n(3.11)\n=\n\u00b1\nu\u00b1\n2 v u\nThe length lee has also been termed the Aharonov-Bohm\ndephasing length.27,28,31,32 Note that this length agrees\nwith the Golden-rule estimate (2.14), up to a numerical\nfactor.\nFor \u03b1 \u226a 1 we have\nlT \u2243 v/2\u03c0T,\n\nlee \u2243 lT /\u03b1,\n\n(3.12)\n\ni.e., lee for weak interaction is much longer than lT . In\nSecs. IV and V, when considering the system in the presence of disorder, there will appear one more characteristic length scale: the electron mean free path due to\nbackscattering off impurities l. We will assume that T is\nsufficiently large, so that lee \u226a l. As will be seen below,\nthis condition means that the disordered system is in the\nWL regime. For lower temperatures, strong localization\nsets in.30 Altogether, the hierarchy of length scales in our\nproblem is\nlT \u226a lee \u226a l .\n\n(3.13)\n\nand x positive, we transform the contour of integration\nas shown in Fig. 4. Closing the contour upwards, the\nintegral along the real axis of \u03c4 is represented as a sum of\ntwo integrals along the imaginary axis at \u03c4 = +0 and \u03c4 =\n1/T \u2212 0. In view of the periodicity of G+ (x, \u03c4 ) in \u03c4 , the\nsum gives the integral along the contour around the cut.\nClosing similarly the contour of integration downward if\nboth \u03b5n and x are negative, we get\nZ\n\n0\n\n1/T\n\nd\u03c4 exp(i\u03b5n \u03c4 ) G+ (x, \u03c4 ) = Gr+ (x, i\u03b5n ) \u2212 Ga+ (x, i\u03b5n ) .\n\n(3.14)\nHere \u03b5n = 2\u03c0(n + 12 )T is the fermionic Matsubara frequency,\nGr+ (x, i\u03b5n ) = \u03b8(\u03b5n )\u03b8(x)G (x, \u03b5n ) ,\nGa+ (x, i\u03b5n ) = \u03b8(\u2212\u03b5n )\u03b8(\u2212x)G (x, \u03b5n ) ,\n\n(3.15)\n\nand the function G (x, \u03b5n ) depends on the absolute values\nof the coordinate and energy:\nZ 2|x|/u\u2212\nT\n\u221a\ndt\nexp(\u2212|\u03b5n x|/u)\ni uv\n0\nexp(\u2212|\u03b5n |t)\n\u00d7\n.\n[ sinh(\u03c0T t) sinh(2\u03c0T |x|/u\u2212 \u2212 \u03c0T t) ]1/2\n(3.16)\n\nG (x, \u03b5n ) =\n\nr,a\nFor left movers, Gr,a\n\u2212 (x, i\u03b5n ) = G+ (\u2212x, i\u03b5n ). Integration\nin Eq.

Within\nthe small-\u03b1 approximation (3.4), the only singularity of\nG+ (x, \u03c4 ) is a branch cut between \u03c4 = |x|/u and |x|/v in\nthe upper or lower half-plane of \u03c4 depending on the sign\nof x. Since G+ (x, \u03c4 ) in this approximation is analytical in\none of the half-planes of \u03c4 , its Fourier transform vanishes\nfor \u03b5n < 0 if x > 0 or for \u03b5n > 0 if x < 0. For both \u03b5n\n\nwhere \u0393(z) is the gamma-function. After the analytical\ncontinuation to real energies i\u03b5n \u2192 \u03b5 + i0, Eq. (3.19)\nreveals oscillations of Gr+ (x, \u03b5) as a function of \u03b5x/u\nand an exponential decay as a function of x/lee . Using\nEq. (3.19) for the analytical continuation is only accurate\nfor (|\u03b5|/T )(x/lee ) \u226b 1. In the opposite limit, one has to\nanalytically continue already in Eq. (3.17), which yields\nthe \"static limit\" for the Green's function with\nG (x, 0) \u2243\n\n\u0003\n2 exp(x/2lee ) \u0002\n\u221a\nK \u03c7(x) ,\ni\u03c0 uv\n\n(3.20)\n\n\f9\nwhere K(z) is the complete elliptic integral.

(3.19) and (3.21) match\nonto each other at (|\u03b5|/T )(x/lee ) \u223c 1. Finally, the highenergy short-distance asymptotic behavior of the Green's\nfunction is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nexp(\u2212\u03b5n x/u+ )\n\u03b5n x\n\u221a\n,\nG (x \u226a lee , \u03b5n \u226b T ) \u2243\nI0\nu\u2212\ni uv\n(3.22)\nwhere I0 (z) is the Bessel function of the imaginary argument.\nThe imaginary part of Gr+ (x, \u03b5) [obtained as an analytical continuation of Gr+ (x, i\u03b5n ) onto the real axis of\nenergy from the upper half-plane] as a function of x for\nsmall and large \u03b5/T is shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. While in the former case there are only simple oscillations which are suppressed exponentially on the scale\nof lee [cf. Eq. (3.19)], the behavior of Gr+ (x, \u03b5) in the latter case is richer. Specifically, Fig. 6 exhibits beatings\nand an intermediate power-law decay, in agreement with\nEq. (3.22). The real part of Gr+ (x, \u03b5) behaves similarly.\n\nFIG. 6: Imaginary part of the Green's function Gr+ (x, \u03b5) as\na function of x for large energies \u03b5 \u226b T . One sees oscillations with a period 2\u03c0u+ /\u03b5, beatings with a period 2\u03c0u\u2212 /\u03b5,\nand a power-law decay x\u22121/2 (taking place up to x \u223c lee ).\nThe asymptotic behavior for large x \u226b lee at which Gr+ (x, \u03b5)\nis suppressed exponentially is not shown in the figure.

(3.14) with respect to x, and\nanalytically continuing the result onto the real axis of\n\u03b5 from the upper half-plane, i\u03b5n \u2192 \u03b5 + i0, we get the\nretarded Green's function GR\n+ (q, \u03b5) in the (q, \u03b5) representation.

The pole that is closest to the real axis [corresponding to complex \u03b5 = uq\u2212iu/2lee and \u03b5 = vq\u2212iv/2lee\nin Eq. (3.23)] determines the spatial/temporal decay of\nthe Green's functions considered in Secs.

(3.26)\u2013(3.28) correspond to the retarded and advanced functions, respectively.\nNote that the influence of interaction on the behavior\nof GR,A\n+ (q, \u03b5) is twofold. Firstly, it factorizes the singleparticle fermionic Green's function into two parts characterized by different velocities-v for the spin factor and\nu for the charge factor. This is the essence of the SCS.\nSecondly, at finite T , interaction leads to a broadening\nof the singularities in the spectral weight, i.e., to a shift\nof the singularities of GR,A\n+ (q, \u03b5) into the complex plane.\nIn the (x, \u03b5) representation, this shift manifests itself in\nthe exponential damping of the Green's function on the\nspatial scale of lee , as discussed in Sec. III B.\nFigures 7 and 8 illustrate how the imaginary and real\nparts of GR\n+ (q, \u03b5) as a function of \u03b5 evolve with varying\ntemperature. At T = 0 one gets:54\n1\n\u221a\nGR\n+ (q, \u03b5) = \u221a\n\u03b5 \u2212 uq \u03b5 \u2212 vq\n\nFIG. 7: Spectral weight ImGR\n+ (q, \u03b5) (arbitrary units) for right\nmovers as a function of energy for different temperatures and\nu/v = 1.1. At low T , the SCS manifests itself in the doublepeak structure, with two peaks located at \u03b5 = vq and \u03b5 = uq.\nWhen T increases (T /vq = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1) the singularities are rounded off and eventually a single peak emerges.\n\n(3.29)\n\n(for u \u2192 v, \u03b5 is understood as \u03b5 + i0). At low T , there\nis a double-peak structure which represents the SCS,\nwith square-root singularities at \u03b5 = vq and \u03b5 = uq,\nweakly smeared by temperature. With increasing T ,\nthe broadening becomes more pronounced and eventually two peaks in the spectral weight merge into a single\npeak of width \u223c \u03b1T .\nAt this point, it is worth recalling that we have neglected effects of interaction which are related to the\nexponent \u03b1b \u223c O(\u03b12 ) in Eq. (3.2). Retaining \u03b1b , i.e.,\nincluding the last factor in Eq. (3.2) would only lead\nto the following two effects, both of which are of minor importance in our consideration at weak interaction.\nFirstly, there will be an additional small asymmetry between two peaks in Figs. 7 and 8. Secondly, an additional,\nweak singularity (characterized by the exponent \u03b1b ) will\narise at \u03b5 = \u2212uq (cf. Refs. 55 and 54, where the singleparticle Green's function in a spinful LL was investigated\nat T = 0 beyond the weak-interaction limit).\nTo conclude, in Sec. III we have analyzed the behavior of single-particle excitations in a spinful LL at finite\nT . We have demonstrated that, because of the SCS, it is\ndramatically modified as compared to the spinless case.\nIn particular, the decay length lee turned out to be parametrically shorter than for spinless electrons. However,\na priori it is not immediately clear to what extent the\nmodification of the single-particle properties will affect\nthe transport (i.e., two-particle for fermions) properties\nof a spinful LL. Indeed, as shown in Refs. 27,28 for the\nspinless case, the WL dephasing length l\u03c6 is parametrically longer than lee . Calculation of the conductivity of\na disordered quantum wire in the presence of spin is a\nsubject of the next section.\n\nFIG. 8:\nReal part of the right-mover Green's function\nGR\n+ (q, \u03b5) as a function of energy. Parameters are the same\nas in Fig. 7. The singularities are smoothened and the peakdip structure broadened with increasing temperature.\n\nIV.\n\nWEAK LOCALIZATION\n\nSo far we have analyzed the single-particle properties\nof a spinful LL at finite T in the absence of disorder.\nNow we introduce disorder and turn to the calculation\nof a two-particle quantity, namely, the conductivity. At\nhigh T , the leading term in the conductivity is given by\nthe Drude formula,\n\u03c3D =\n\n2e2\nl,\n\u03c0\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith a renormalized56,57,58,59 by interaction-therefore\ntemperature dependent-mean free path l \u221d T \u03b1r .\nWe consider now a correction \u2206\u03c3 to the Drude conductivity, associated with the quantum interference of\nelectron waves multiple-scattered off disorder. In 1D,\nthe leading contribution to \u2206\u03c3 comes from a Cooperontype scattering process which, in contrast to higher dimensionalities, involves a minimal possible number of\n\n\f11\n\n(a)\n\nCooperon\").27,28 The peculiarity of 1D in this respect is\nthat a single-channel quantum wire is in the WL regime-\nnot strongly localized-only if the dephasing length l\u03c6\nthat cuts off the WL correction is shorter than the mean\nfree path l. That is, the WL correction is accumulated\non ballistic scales-hence the shortest possible Cooperon\nladder with three impurity legs.\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\nA.\n\nFIG. 9: Diagrams giving the leading contribution to the interference correction to the conductivity. The dashed lines\nrepresent the impurity scatterings and the solid lines denote\nthe electron Green's functions (with the disorder effects incorporated at the self-energy level) and the dashed lines represent the impurity-induced backscattering.

Note also\nthat Eq. (4.2) is written in terms of the contribution of\nthe Cooperon with chiralities of the current vertices as\nshown in Fig. 10. The numerical coefficient in Eq. (4.2)\ntakes into account that \u2206\u03c3WL is a factor of 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8\nlarger than the contribution of the diagram in Fig 10 [one\nof the factors of 2 comes from the spin, another from a\nsummation over chiralities of the current vertices and the\nthird one from diagrams (b) and (c) in Fig. 9].\nThe approximation (3.4) means that the terms in the\nexponent of Q(x, \u03c4 ) [Eqs. (2.21),(2.22), and(2.26)] that\ncome from B++ (x, \u03c4 ) and B\u2212\u2212 (x, \u03c4 ) and are proportional\nto \u03b1b are neglected. As for the term that comes from\nB+\u2212 (x, \u03c4 ) and is proportional to \u03b1r , it leads to a renormalization of the impurity strength (see Ref. 28 for details) but does not contribute to the dephasing rate to\nfirst order in \u03b1, similarly to the spinless case. Therefore,\nin the calculation below we put both \u03b1b and \u03b1r in Q(x, \u03c4 )\nequal to zero, while l0 is replaced by l which is understood\nas the renormalized mean free path.

This corresponds to retaining only those\nCooperon diagrams that contain an equal number of the\nretarded and advanced Green's functions, even with e-e\ninteraction included.\nWe are thus left with the functions G\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ), Q(x, \u03c4 ),\nand C\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ) that are all given\np by various combinasinh[\u03c0T (x/u \u00b1 i\u03c4 )] and\ntions\nof\nsquare-root\nfactors\np\nsinh[\u03c0T (x/v \u00b1 i\u03c4 )]. Note that G\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ) and C\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 )\nenter Eq. (4.10) only in the combination G\u00b1 C\u00b1 with the\nsame arguments. Equation (4.10) will be analyzed in the\nnext two subsections.\nB.\n\nRegular impurity configurations: Weak\nlocalization\n\nIn Eq. (4.10), we transform the integration contours\nfor each of the time variables similarly to Fig. 4. As\na result, we obtain integrals along square-root branch\ncuts in the vertical direction, each of which connects two\npoints whose coordinates can be written as \u03c4 + ix/u and\n\u03c4 + ix/v with different \u03c4 and x. For example, let us\nassume, here and throughout the paper below, that in\nEq. (4.10) all\nxa , xb , xc > 0\n\n(4.14)\n\n(the region of integration xa < 0 and xb , xc > 0 gives the\nsame contribution to \u2206\u03c3WL ). Then, starting with the\nintegration over \u03c4a and closing the contour upwards, we\nrepresent the integral along the real axis of \u03c4a as a sum of\nthree integrals around vertical cuts: between ixa /u and\nixa /v, between \u2212\u03c4\u0304b + ixc /u and \u2212\u03c4\u0304b + ixc /v, and between \u2212\u03c4\u0304c + ixb /u and \u2212\u03c4\u0304c + ixb /v. The first cut comes\n\n(4.12)\n\nfrom the Green's function G+ (xa , \u03c4a ), whereas the last\ntwo from the factors Q(xb , \u03c4a + \u03c4c ) and Q(xc , \u03c4a + \u03c4\u0304b ), respectively. Since G+ (x, \u03c4 ) as a function of x for a given\n\u03c4 falls of on the scale of lT , while Q(x, \u03c4 ) on the scale of\nlee , one sees that in the limit of small \u03b1 the main contribution to \u2206\u03c3WL comes from the branch cuts that are\nassociated with the Green's functions. The cuts related\nto the factors Q(x, \u03c4 ) can be neglected.\nThe selection of singularities at \u03b1 \u226a 1 is closely analogous to that in the spinless case, see Appendix F of\nRef. 28. For spinless electrons, the main contribution to\n\u2206\u03c3WL stems from singularities (\"nearly poles\" for weak\ninteraction) of the single-particle Green's functions at the\nclassical trajectory of an electron moving with the velocity u. Other close-to-pole singularities (those in the factors Q and C), which are related to \"nonclassical trajectories\", yield subleading corrections small in the parameter lT /l\u03c6 \u226a 1. The spinful problem is very much similar\nin this respect. The main difference is that the dominant\nsingularities are now pairs of close square-root branching\npoints rather than the poles. The transformation of the\npoles into the branch cuts, induced by the SCS, can be\nviewed as a \"smearing\" of the classical trajectories: all\nvelocities between v and u become accessible.\nLet us first consider the contribution to Eq. (4.10) from\ntypical impurity configuration for which the characteristic scale of\nxa \u223c xb \u223c xc\n\n(4.15)\n\nis of the order of l\u03c6 \u226b lT .

ANOMALOUS IMPURITY\nCONFIGURATIONS: MEMORY EFFECTS\n\nThe WL contribution to the conductivity, calculated\nin the preceding section, is associated with scattering on\ncompact three-impurity configurations which are \"regular\" in the sense that the characteristic distances between\nall three impurities are the same. Below, we will see\nthat \"anomalous\" (strongly asymmetric) configurations\nin which two of the impurities are anomalously close to\neach other, i.e., xa \u226a xb or xb \u226a xa (see Fig. 11b),\ngive rise to a conductivity correction which is larger than\n\u2206\u03c3WL if T is sufficiently high. As mentioned already in\nSec. I, the relevance of the asymmetric configurations is\nrelated to the classical ME60 in electron kinetics, in contrast to the quantum interference of scattered waves that\nyields \u2206\u03c3WL .\nA.\n\nQualitative consideration: Identifying scales\nand parameters\n\nTo demonstrate the peculiarity of the asymmetric impurity configurations, it is instructive to consider first\n\n(a)\nl ee\n\nl ee\n\n(b)\nlT\n\nl\n\nFIG. 11: Three-impurity configurations that give the main\ncontribution to the (a) quantum (WL) and (b) classical (ME)\ncorrections to the conductivity. The characteristic distances\nbetween the impurities are shown.\n\nthe limit of two scattering events occurring at the same\npoint, by setting\nx1 = x3\n\n(5.1)\n\nin Eq. (4.2). As discussed at the beginning of Sec. IVB,\nfor typical impurity configurations (4.15) the main contribution to the correction (4.2) comes from \"smeared\"\nclassical trajectories, meaning that all trajectories with\nvelocities between v and u contribute to \u2206\u03c3WL . The\ncase (5.1) is, however, special in that only one velocity\nremains and that is the velocity of noninteracting electrons v. Indeed, at x1 = x3 the four Q factors that depend on x1 \u2212 x3 drop out of the integration over times-\nsince Q(0, \u03c4 ) [Eq. (4.5)] does not depend on \u03c4 . After\nthis, the integrals in Eq. (4.2) over \u03c41 and \u03c4\u03041 are dominated by the poles of the noninteracting Green's functions g+ (0, \u03c41 \u2212 \u03c4\u03043 ) and g\u2212 (0, \u03c4\u03041 \u2212 \u03c43 ), which yields\n\u03c41 = \u03c4\u03043 ,\n\n\u03c4\u03041 = \u03c43 ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nand then all the remaining factors Q compensate each\nother. We thus end up with a product of six bare Green's\nfunctions g\u00b1 multiplied by the factors W\u00b1 , which constitutes the noninteracting limit of the problem.61\nIn fact, the compensation of the dephasing factors\nis evident even before the averaging over the fluctuating fields \u03b8\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ) (Fig. 10). Indeed, the factors\nexp{\u00b1i[\u03b8+(x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b8\u2212 (x, \u03c4 )]}, dressing two impurity vertices, cancel each other when taken at the same spacetime point [Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2)]. As a result, the third\nimpurity located at x2 becomes decoupled with respect\nto e-e interaction from the two-impurity complex at\nx1 = x3 .\nIn the cyclic variables (4.7), Eq. (5.1) means xa = 0.\nSince interaction completely drops out of the problem at\nxa = 0, the integration over the remaining spatial coordinate xb = xc in Eq. (4.10) is not cut off by dephasing, in\ncontrast to the regular impurity configurations, for which\nit is restricted to xc . lee \u226a l. In this situation, we\nhave to take into account a disorder-induced damping\nof the single-particle Green's functions g\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ), which\nresults in an additional factor exp(\u2212|x|/4l) attached to\n\n\f16\n\n(a)\n\nxa ~\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\nxb\n\n~\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n2 3\n\nlT\nlT\n3 2\n\n(b)\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\nlT\nxa ~\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\nxb\n\n~\n\nlT\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(c)\n\nxa ~\n\nlT\n3\n\n1\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\nxb\n\n3\n\n2\n\n~\n\nlT\n\n+\n\n+\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\nmote third impurity in the three-impurity Cooperon diagram happens to be in the crossover region between the\nballistic and diffusive motion, we should extend the single\nscattering on the third impurity to an infinite sequence\nof scatterings on other impurities,62 i.e., to a diffuson\nladder, as shown in Fig. 12. One sees that the diagram\ntakes the form characteristic of a quasiclassical ME:60 an\nelectron is scattered at x1 \u2243 x3 , then moves around diffusively, and returns to x1 \u2243 x3 where it is scattered once\nagain. Clearly, this is a non-Markovian process which is\nbeyond the conventional Boltzmann description. However, the non-Boltzmann type of kinetics associated with\nthe return processes is classical in origin: as discussed\nabove, when the points x1 and x3 are sufficiently close to\neach other, dephasing becomes irrelevant. We will first\nanalyze the simplest three-impurity diagram at finite but\nsmall xa and include the diffusive returns (which will only\nrenormalize the numerical prefactor) later in the end of\nthis section.\nIt is instructive to begin with a semi-quantitative analysis which will give correctly the parametric dependence\nof the result but not the numerical coefficient. To this\nend, we replace all hyperbolic sines in both the Green's\nfunctions G\u00b1 and the Q and C\u00b1 factors in Eq. (4.10) by\ntheir exponential asymptotics, Eq. (4.16). This approximation is parametrically correct, since all integrals in\nEq. (4.16) are determined by the regions of integration\nin which the arguments of the hyperbolic sines are of the\norder of or larger than 1. Within the \"exponential\" approximation, the product C of six factors C\u00b1 is given by\nEq. (4.17), while the product G of six Green's functions\nin Eq. (4.16) becomes\nG \u221d exp(\u22122xc /lee ) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nFIG. 12: Each diagram for \u2206\u03c3 in Fig. 9 has two ME contributions, coming from xa \u223c lT (3\u0304 \u2192 1, 1\u0304 \u2192 3) and xb \u223c lT\n(2 \u2192 3, 2\u0304 \u2192 3\u0304). The remote-impurity line should be replaced\nby the full diffuson ladder.\n\nso that the exponential factors in G and C cancel each\nother, similarly to the regular impurity configurations\nin Sec. IV B. What is different, however, is that when\ncalculating the factor Q [Eqs. (4.18)\u2013(4.20)] one can no\nlonger omit the moduli in Eq. (4.20) if\n\neach g\u00b1 (x, \u03c4 ). On the Cooperon loop, these combine\nto give the overall factor exp(\u2212xc /l) in the integrand\nof Eq. (4.2), so that xb = xc is then limited by the mean\nfree path, see Fig. 11b.\nSince at xa = 0 the characteristic distance to the re-\n\nxa < 2\u03b1xc\n\n(5.4)\n\n[or xb < 2\u03b1xc -we will proceed with the estimate for the\ncase of Eq. (5.4)]. For the strongly asymmetric configurations (5.4), Eq. (4.20) is rewritten as\n\nq \u2243 \u22128xc /u\u2212 + 2xa /u \u2212 tb \u2212 2xa /u \u2212 tb + 2xc /u\u2212 + 2xa /u \u2212 t\u0304b \u2212 2xa /u \u2212 t\u0304b + 2xc /u\u2212\n+ 2xa /u + tc \u2212 2xa /u + tc \u2212 2xc /u\u2212 + 2xa /u + t\u0304c \u2212 2xa /u + t\u0304c \u2212 2xc /u\u2212 ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere we have neglected terms of second order in \u03b1. In particular, the integration over ta and t\u0304a goes along very\nshort branch cuts of length \u221d \u03b1xa \u223c \u03b12 xc . To our accuracy, the cuts reduce to poles. For this reason, we have set\nta = t\u0304a = 0 in Eq. (5.5).\nThe integrals over remaining time variables in Eq. (4.10) decouple from each other and can be easily calculated\n(note that the integrals over tb and tc are identical-in the dc limit-to those over t\u0304b and t\u0304c , respectively). Let us\n\n\f17\ndenote \u2206\u03c3asym the contribution to the conductivity that comes from the strongly asymmetric impurity configurations\nwith |xa,b | < 2\u03b1xc .

(5.6),\nwhich yields a contribution to \u2206\u03c3asym /\u03c3D of the order of \u2212lee lT /l2 . This is much smaller than the contribution of\nthe regular impurity configurations [Eq. (4.22)] and can be neglected. However, the situation is qualitatively different\nfor the interval (5.8). Indeed, for 1, x \u226a y, the functions |f2 (x, y, z)|2 and |f3 (x, y, z)|2 take the form\n1\nexp(izx) \u2212 1\n+\nz\n1 + iz\nexp[2(y \u2212 x)]\n\u2243\n.\n(z 2 + 1)\n\n|f2 (x, y, z)|2 \u2243\n|f3 (x, y, z)|2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n\nAs a result, the factor exp(\u22122xc /lee ) from the first line of Eq.

(5.10).\nThe remaining integral over xc is no longer restricted to xc . lee but rather extends to xc \u223c l, in agreement with our\nqualitative consideration of the ME effect for xa = 0 at the beginning of this section. The ME contribution \u2206\u03c3ME\nto the conductivity thus arises from the impurity configurations obeying Eq. (5.8) and is given by the second term in\nEq. (5.6).

For comparison, an analogous plot for the spinless problem is presented in Fig. 13b. One\nsees that in the spinful case the \"quantum\" and \"classical\" domains are parametrically separated from each other.\n2\nAs a result, their areas lee\n\u221d T \u22122 and llT \u221d T \u22121 , respectively, can \"compete\" with each other. On the contrary, in\nthe spinless case, the ME strips of area \u223c llee are directly adjacent to the WL domain, whose area \u223c llee ln(l/lee )\nsl\nis (logarithmically) larger. It follows that for spinless electrons the ME correction \u2206\u03c3ME\ngives only a subleading\nsl\ncontribution as compared to the WL correction \u2206\u03c3WL [Eq.

This allowed us to identify the relevant scales and obtain the\nparametric dependence of the result. Here, we calculating the integrals over the temporal variables tb , t\u0304b , tc , and t\u0304c\nmore accurately and find the numerical prefactor in Eq. (5.11). The estimate in Sec. V A teaches us that the dominant\ncontribution to \u2206\u03c3ME comes from xa \u223c lT and xb \u2243 xc \u223c l, while the integrals over tb,c and t\u0304b,c are determined by\nthe upper limit of integration, i.e., by the time scale \u03b1xc /v \u223c \u03b1l/v. In the WL regime, this time scale is much larger\nthan 1/T .\nSimilarly to the case of regular impurity configurations, we observe that the product of all the C factors can always\nbe approximated by Eq. (4.17), whereas the hyperbolic sines should be retained in the Green's functions G\u00b1 . As\nfor the factors Q, in contrast to the regular configurations, not all of them can be replaced by their asymptotics.\nSpecifically, those hyperbolic sines in the Q factors that correspond to the moduli in Eq. (5.5) (i.e., all terms in q\nexcept for the first one) should retain their form and not be replaced by the exponentials. Importantly, within this\n\"partially exponential\" approximation, all integrals over times are still decoupled. Thus, we replace the exponential\nfactor depending on tc in Sec.

Firstly,\nsimilarly to the WL correction, the contribution of diagram (a) in Fig. 12 should be multiplied by a factor of\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 due to (i) two possible chiralities of the\ncurrent vertices; (ii) diagrams (b) and (c) in Fig. 12; and\n(iii) two possible anomalous configurations for each diagram: xa \u223c lT \u226a xb and xb \u223c lT \u226a xa . Secondly,\nas mentioned above, not only the return after one single\nbackscattering but rather the entire diffuson ladder contributes to \u2206\u03c3ME [Fig. 12]. The insertion of the diffuson\ninto the three-impurity diagram effectively generates an\nadditional velocity-vertex correction, which yields a factor of 1/2 (the ratio of the transport and total scattering\ntimes for the backscattering impurities).\n\nVI.\n\nPATH-INTEGRAL METHOD\n\nSo far, we have been treating the conductivity correction within the formalism of Matsubara functional\nbosonization. This powerful method treats on an equal\nfooting28 the real inelastic scattering processes responsible for dephasing and the virtual transitions responsible\nfor the renormalization effects. An alternative approach,\nformulated for the spinless case in Refs. 27 and 28, consists of two steps. Firstly, disorder is renormalized by virtual processes with characteristic energy transfer larger\nthan T . What is obtained after the renormalization is\nan effective \"low-energy\" theory which is free of ultraviolet singularities characteristic of a LL. The low-energy\ntheory is treated by means of a path-integral approach,\nanalogous to the one developed in Ref. 63 for higherdimensional systems. This method is particularly convenient for an analysis of inelastic scattering (dephasing) in problems with a nontrivial infrared behavior. In\nRef. 28, the WL correction to the conductivity was calculated both within the path-integral and the functionalbosonization schemes, with identical results. The path-\n\nintegral calculation also allows one to \"visualize\" the origin of the dephasing processes in terms of quasiclassical\ntrajectories.\nIn this section, we present a path-integral analysis of\nthe conductivity correction in the spinful problem. It\nturns out that the situation here is more intricate than\nin the spinless case, for two reasons: (i) the characteristic energy transfer in the path-integral calculation is\nof the order of T (while it was much smaller than T for\nspinless electrons); (ii) because of the SCS, the velocity of\nthe quasiclassical trajectories is not uniquely defined: the\nwhole interval of velocities between v and u contributes\nto \u2206\u03c3WL , see Sec. III. As a result, we will only be able\nto reproduce the parametrical dependence of the conductivity correction but not the numerical prefactor. Nevertheless, this analysis is useful, since it yields a physically\ntransparent picture of the quantum interference and dephasing in the spin-charge separated system.\nSince the dominant contribution to the dephasing rate\nis given by the g4 \u2013processes of scattering between electrons from the same chiral branch, we will set g2 = 0\nwhich is consistent with our central approximation \u03b1b \u2192\n0. Furthermore, it is convenient to introduce different\nk\ncoupling constants,1,2 g4 and g4\u22a5 , for interaction between\nelectrons with equal and opposite spins, respectively (at\nk\nthe end, we set g4 = g4\u22a5 = g \u2243 2\u03c0v\u03b1). In view of the\nk\nPauli principle, the g4 \u2013interaction does not lead to any\nreal scattering but only renormalizes the velocity of electrons:\nk\n\nv \u2192 v \u2217 = v(1 + g4 /2\u03c0v) .\n\n(6.1)\n\nk\n\nThis allows us to put g4 = 0, simultaneously replacing v\nby v \u2217 . All the nontrivial interaction-induced physics is\ndue to g4\u22a5 \u2013processes.\nSolving the corresponding RPA equations for the interaction propagators, we get for parallel (V k ) and anti-\n\n\f20\n\n(a)\nx(t)\nbackward\n\nxa\no\n\nt\n\nwhere u = v(1 + 2\u03b1) and v \u2217 = v(1 + \u03b1). We note that\nV \u22a5 does not enter the path integral, since electron spin\nis conserved.\nThe general expression for the WL dephasing action acquired on the exactly time-reversed trajectories\nxb (t) = xf (tC \u2212 t) for the three-impurity Cooperon\nreads27,28\nZ\nZ tC\nZ tC\nZ\nd\u03c9\ndq\ndt2\ndt1\nSij (tC , {x(t)}) = \u2212T\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\nk\n\nImV\u03bc\u03bd (q, \u03c9)\nexp {iq[ xi (t1 ) \u2212 xj (t2 )] \u2212 i\u03c9[t1 \u2212 t2 ]}\n\u03c9\nZ tC\nZ tC\nk\ndt2 F\u03bc\u03bd\n[xi (t1 ) \u2212 xj (t2 ), t1 \u2212 t2 ] ,\ndt1\n= \u2212T\n\nforward\n\n\u2212xb\n\n\u00d7\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(6.4)\n\n(b)\nx(t)\nbackward\n\nxa\n\nt\n\no\nforward\n\nwhere each of the indices i, j takes one of the values \"f\"\n(for the forward path of the Cooperon) or \"b\" (for the\nk\nbackward path), \u03bc = sgn\u1e8bi and \u03bd = sgn\u1e8bj , and F\u03bc\u03bd (x, t)\nk\nis the Fourier transform of \u03c9 \u22121 ImV\u03bc\u03bd (q, \u03c9). The main\ncontribution comes from the diagonal terms with i = j\nand t1 = t2 , for which \u03bc = \u03bd, see Fig. 14a. The imaginary part of the corresponding interaction propagator is\nwritten as\n\u03c9\nuv\n\u00d7 [ u \u03b4(vq \u2213 \u03c9) + v \u03b4(uq \u2213 \u03c9)] , (6.5)\n\nk\n\nIm V\u00b1\u00b1 (q, \u03c9) = (\u03c0v \u2217 \u03b1)2\n\n\u2212xb\n\nwhich gives\nFIG. 14: World lines corresponding to the time-reversed trajectories (solid and dashed lines) with velocity v \u2217 in the threeimpurity Cooperon.

Here Nf,b is the number of the\nsmall-angle intersections (black dots) of a plasmon line with\nthe forward (f ) and backward (b) paths. The intersections at\na large angle (the plasmon and electrons moving in opposite\ndirections, unfilled circles) contribute to the dephasing only\nat second order in \u03b1 and hence are neglected.

There, we show by the circles\nand black dots the space-time coordinates for which the\narguments of the \u03b4-functions in Eq. (6.6) are zero. The\nmain contribution to S comes from small-angle intersections (black dots).

Eq. (2.14)]. As\na result, the action for typical impurity configurations\n(Fig. 14a) reads\nS \u223c \u03b12 T tC /|\u03b1| \u223c |\u03b1|T tC .\n\nparallel (V \u22a5 ) spins :\n\u22a5\nV++\n(q, \u03c9)\n\nk\n\nF\u00b1\u00b1 (x, t) = \u2212\u03c0\n\n\u22a5(k)\n\nV\u2212\u2212 (q, \u03c9) = V++ (\u2212q, \u03c9) ,\n\n(6.3)\n\n(6.7)\n\nFor comparison, in the spinless case27,28 , intersections\nbetween the interaction and particle propagators running in the same direction give zero dephasing because of\nthe cancellation between the Hartree and exchange terms\n(Sec. II B). On the other hand, at large angles the ballistic (straight line) interaction propagator always intersects\na pair of (forward and backward) electron trajectories,\nwhich gives zero dephasing as well. As a result, only the\nintersections at large angles that arise from scattering of\n\n\f21\nthe interaction propagator off disorder contribute to the\ndephasing rate.27,28\nMore rigorously, substituting Eq.

Any other velocity between v and u yields a qualitatively similar action, but\nwith different numerical factors. This is another indication of the previously discussed fact that all velocities\nfrom this interval contribute to the conductivity correction.\n\nS\nWL\n\nME\n\n1\n\nME\n\nxa /xc\n0\n\n\u03b1/2\n\n1\u2212\u03b1/2\n\n1\n\nFIG. 15: Dephasing action S (in units of 2xc /lee ) corresponding to the velocity v \u2217 , Eq.

V.\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo conclude, we have analyzed, within the functional\nbosonization formalism, the quantum interference of interacting electrons in a disordered spinful LL. Our results\nare summarized in Table I and in Fig. 16.\nThe single-particle properties of fermionic excitations\nin this model have been studied in Sec. III in several\nrepresentations. Two most important and interrelated\n\nfeatures of the single-particle spectral characteristics are:\n(i) the SCS, as a result of which the whole range of velocities between the charge velocity u and the spin velocity\nv contributes to the spectral function, and (ii) the singleparticle decay on the spatial scale of lee , Eq. (3.9).\nIn Sec.IV we have calculated the leading quantum interference correction to the conductivity, Eq. (4.25). The\ncorresponding dephasing length l\u03c6 is given by Eq. (4.28).\nTwo qualitative differences as compared to the spinless\ncase should be emphasized in this context. Firstly, for\nspinful electrons, the decay length of single-particle excitations is inversely proportional to the first order in the\ninteraction strength \u03b1, lee \u223c \u03b1\u22121 lT , whereas lee \u223c \u03b1\u22122 lT\nin the absence of spin. Secondly, the WL dephasing\nlength l\u03c6 is equal to the single-particle dephasing length\nlee in the spinful model,\u221awhereas l\u03c6 depends on the\nstrength of disorder, l\u03c6 \u223c lee l, for spinless electrons.\nIn Sec. V we have analyzed the contribution to the\nCooperon diagrams of \"nontypical\" configurations of disorder with two impurities being anomalously close to\neach other. We have shown that this contribution,\nEq. (5.16), describes the quasiclassical ME. It is parametrically smaller than the WL term at sufficiently low\nT and gives the leading correction to the conductivity in\nthe limit of high T .\n\n\u03c3(\u03a4)\n\nDrude\n\nME\n\nstrong\nlocalization\n\nWL\n\u03a4\n\nv/l\n\nv/\u03b1 l\n\nv/\u03b1 l\n2\n\nFIG. 16: Schematic plot (log-log scale) of the T dependence\nof the conductivity \u03c3(T ) of spinful electrons.\n\nOur findings, demonstrating the strong dependence of\nthe quantum interference effects on spin in a LL, imply\nthat the Zeeman splitting by magnetic field should lead\nto strong effects in the conductivity of a single-channel\nquantum wire.

First, in the presence of spin, g1 processes \"added\" to the clean LL model are a \"marginally\nrelevant\" or \"marginally irrelevant\" perturbation in the\nrenormalization-group sense, depending on the sign of the\nbare g1 (see, e.g., Refs. 1,2). For repulsive Coulomb interaction (g1 > 0), weak backward e-e scattering is marginally\nirrelevant, i.e., only leads to a small renormalization of\nthe effective couplings of the LL theory on (exponentially) large spatial scales. We neglect the weak renormalization due to g1 -processes altogether. Second, there\nexist phenomena which are entirely due to g1 -processes.\nOne of these is the spin-related magnetoresistance of a\nsingle-channel quantum wire,41,42 which we will consider\nelsewhere.42 However, for the effects studied in the present\npaper, it suffices to deal with forward e-e scattering only.\nK.A.
