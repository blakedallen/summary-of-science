This was first proved by Thurston.\nA direct proof was given by Bestvina and Feighn [BF92]. Using their idea, Mosher\n[Mos97] proved the following theorem.\nConsider an oriented closed hyperbolic surface S. Let \u03a61 , * * * , \u03a6m \u2208 MCG(S)\nbe an independent set of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes of S, and let \u03c61 , * * * , \u03c6m \u2208\nHomeo(S) be pseudo-Anosov representatives of \u03a61 , * * * , \u03a6m respectively. If i1 , * * * , im\nare large enough positive integers, then the fundamental group of the graph of spaces\nG, as shown in Figure 1, is a hyperbolic group. In the statement of this theorem, by\nS\n\u03c6i22\n\nid\n\nS\n11\n00\n00\n11\n\n\u03c6i11\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nid\n\nS\nid\n\n\u03c6imm\n\nS\n\nFigure 1:\nsaying a set B of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes is independent, we mean the sets\nF ix(\u03a6) are pairwise disjoint for \u03a6 \u2208 B, where F ix(\u03a6) consists of the attractor and\nthe repeller of \u03a6 on the space of projective measured foliations PMF (S).\nA graph of surfaces S\u0393 consists of an oriented connected finite underlying graph \u0393,\na function which assigns to each vertex a closed hyperbolic surface or orbifold, to each\nedge a closed hyperbolic surface, and another function which assigns to each oriented\nedge a covering map from the edge surface to the vertex surface of the origin of the\nedge. In the cases studied in this paper, we change the canonical graph of surfaces\nby cutting along the edge surfaces, then choosing pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms\nof the edge surfaces, then regluing. We call it a graph of surfaces with pseudoAnosov regluing. Thus the mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism can\nbe considered as this type of space whose underlying graph consists of only one vertex\nand one edge, and the vertex and edge spaces are the same hyperbolic surface. The\ncase studied by Mosher is another reglued graph of surfaces with the underlying\ngraph consists of only one vertex, in addition the vertex and edge spaces are the same\nhyperbolic surface S.\nWe shall extend Mosher's theorem to the general graphs of surfaces with pseudoAnosov regluing. Theorem 1 says that if the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms are\n\n\f2\nchosen to satisfy an appropriate independence condition, then the fundamental group\nof the reglued graph of surfaces is word hyperbolic, when these homeomorphisms are\nreplaced with sufficiently high powers of themselves.\nWe shall describe this cutting and regluing process with more details. Let S\u0393\nbe a graph of surfaces with the underlying graph \u0393, let E be the set of oriented\nedges of \u0393, and let V be the set of vertices of \u0393. For each e \u2208 E, let Se be the\ncorresponding edge surface. For each oriented edge e, there is a finite covering map\npe : Se \u2192 Fo(e) , where Fo(e) is the vertex surface of the origin o(e) of the edge e. For\neach inverse pair of oriented edges e, e, there is an inverse pair of homeomorphisms\nge : Se \u2192 Se , ge\u22121 : Se \u2192 Se . Let \u03c6 = {\u03c6e | e \u2208 E}, where \u03c6e : Se \u2192 Se is a pseudoAnosov homeomorphism of Se . Let S\u0393\u03c6 be the graph of surfaces with pseudo-Anosov\nregluing obtained from S\u0393 by cutting along each Se and regluing using \u03c6e , i.e., in the\nreglued graph of surfaces, the effect is to replace the map ge : Se \u2192 Se by the map\nge \u25e6 \u03c6e , for e \u2208 E. Moreover, let m = {me | e \u2208 E}, where me are positive integers,\ne\nand let S\u0393\u03c6m be the graph of surfaces obtained from S\u0393 by regluing using \u03c6m\nfor\ne\neach e \u2208 E.\nGiven a vertex v of the underlying graph \u0393, let Fv be the corresponding vertex surface (or orbifold). For each v \u2208 V , denote Iv = {i| ei is an oriented edge such that the\norigin of ei is v}. For each v \u2208 V and each i \u2208 Iv , there is a finite index covering\nmap pi : Si \u2192 Fv , where Si is a shorthand notation of Sei . For an oriented edge\npi\nei has the vertex v as both of its origin and terminal, the covering maps Si \u2212\n\u2192 Fv\npi\ngi\nand Si \u2212\n\u2192 Si \u2212\n\u2192\nFv might be different, where gi is a shorthand notation of gei . The\nportion of S\u0393\u03c6m around a vertex space Fv could look like in Figure 2\nm\n\nSj\n\ngj \u25e6 \u03c6j j\nSj\u0304\n\npj\n\npj\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nm\n\nS \u0304\n\nS\n\n1\n\ni\n\nm\n\n \u0304\n\u03c61 S1\n\ngi\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\ng1\n\ni\n\nS1\n\n\u03c6\n\np1\n\np \u0304\n\nFv\n\nFigure 2:\nFor the purpose of Theorem 1, fix a hyperbolic structure on each vertex surface\nFv . For each v \u2208 V and each i \u2208 Iv , suppose Si equipped with the pullback metric by\nthe covering map pi : Si \u2192 Fv . Hence for each covering map pi , there is the derivative\nmap Dpi : P Si \u2192 P Fv , where P Si , P Fv are the projective tangent bundles of Si and\n\n\f3\nm\n\nFv respectively. For an oriented edge ej , let \u03c6j j : Sj \u2192 Sj be the pseudo-Anosov\nhomeomorphism for the edge ej , with the stable geodesic lamination \u039bsj \u2282 Sj ; the\nm\n\u2212m\nstable geodesic lamination \u039bjs \u2282 Sj of (\u03c6j j ) = gj \u03c6j j gj\u22121 is homotopic to the image\nm\nunder gj of the unstable geodesic lamination of \u03c6j j . The geodesic laminations \u039bsj\nand \u039bjs are independent of the choice of the exponent mj . In the following, let T \u039bsi\ndenote the unit tangent vector space of \u039bsi .\nThe main theorem of this paper is\nTheorem 1. Let S\u0393\u03c6m be a graph of surfaces with pseudo-Anosov regluing. Let \u0393\nbe its underlying graph . If for each vertex v \u2208 \u0393, and for each i \u2208 Iv , the derivative\nmaps Dpi |T \u039bsi are injections, and their images are disjoint compact subsets of P Fv ,\nthen the fundamental group of S\u0393\u03c6m is hyperbolic, when mi \u2208 m are sufficiently\nlarge.\nThe proof of the hyperbolicity of S\u0393\u03c6m depends ultimately on the Combination\nTheorem of [BF92]. The Combination Theorem says that if the quasi-isometrically\nembedded condition (which is automatically satisfied in the cases studied in this\npaper) and the hallways flare condition (which is much more difficult to check) both\nhold, then S\u0393\u03c6m is a hyperbolic space. In order to check the satisfaction of the\nhallways flare condition, we need to extend the parallel corresponds lemma [Mos97],\nthe key in that paper, to a new version of the parallel corresponds lemma.\nThe idea of the proof of Theorem 1 is: by applying the new version of parallel\ncorresponds lemma, if the hypothesis of Theorem 1 is satisfied, then the hallways flare\ncondition is satisfied. Therefore the fundamental group of S\u0393\u03c6m is hyperbolic.\nHere are some applications of this theorem.\nFirst: let S be a closed hyperbolic surface, let G, H be finite subgroups of the\nmapping class group MCG(S), and let \u03a6 \u2208 MCG(S) be a pseudo-Anosov mapping\nclass. Suppose G, H each have trivial intersection with the virtual centralizer of h\u03a6i\nin MCG(S), then for sufficiently large n, the subgroup A of MCG(S) generated by\nG, \u03a6n H\u03a6\u2212n is isomorphic to the free product of these subgroups. Even more, A is a\nvirtual Schottky subgroup of MCG(S), in the sense of [FM02a].\nSecond: let G\u03c6m be a graph of surfaces with regluing as in Figure 3, where S, F\n\u03c6m\nS\n\nG\u03c6m =\n\nS\n\np\n\nq\n\n1\n0\nF\n\nFigure 3:\nare genus 3 and 2 tori, \u03c6 : S \u2192 S is a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. Suppose\nthere exist simple closed curves a \u2282 F and c \u2282 S, as shown in Figure 4, such that\n\n\f4\np\u22121 (a) = c, c \u2282 q \u22121 (a), and q \u22121 (a) is disconnected. In addition, suppose that in the\ngroup MCG(S), the virtual centralizer of h\u03a6i has trivial intersection with the deck\ntransformation groups of p and q, where \u03a6 is the mapping class of \u03c6. Then \u03c01 (G\u03c6m )\nis hyperbolic when m is sufficiently large.\n\nc\n\na\nF\n\nS\n\nFigure 4:\nMore interesting, we will see that there exists a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism\n\u03c6 of S, such that \u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is not commensurate to \u03c01 (S \u2032 ) \u22ca K, for any oriented, closed\nhyperbolic surface S \u2032 , and for any free group K, where G\u03c6m as the above. More than\nthat, \u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is not even quasi-isometric to any surface-by-free group. Therefore\n\u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is different from all the hyperbolic groups constructed in [Mos97].\nProblems. Do there exist some reducible homeomorphisms of the edge surfaces,\nsuch that the graph of surfaces with reducible homeomorphism regluing are hyperbolic?\nIs Theorem 1 still true when the vertex and edge groups are free groups?\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn this section, we recall some preliminaries about combinatorial and geometric group\ntheory, and some facts of hyperbolic geometry which will be used later.\nGraphs of surfaces (The material in this subsection can be found in [SW79] and\n[Ser80])\nLet \u0393 be a connected finite graph, let e be an oriented edge of \u0393, and let e be the\ninverse edge of e. The vertex o(e) is called the origin of e and the vertex t(e) is called\nthe terminal of e, obviously o(e) = t(e).\nA graph of surfaces S\u0393 consists of a connected finite graph \u0393 and a function\nwhich assigns to each vertex v \u2208 \u0393 a closed hyperbolic surface or orbifold Fv , to\neach pair of oriented edges e, e closed hyperbolic surfaces Se , Se and an inverse\npair of homeomorphisms Se \u2192 Se , Se \u2192 Se , and to each edge e a continuous map\npe : Se \u2192 Fo(e) , such that pe induces an injection on the fundamental groups. In most\nof our cases pe are covering maps for every edge e of \u0393.\nGiven a graph of surfaces S\u0393, we can\nS define the total space S\u0393 as the quotient\nof the disjoint union (\u222a{Fv |v \u2208 V (\u0393)}) (\u222a{Se \u00d7 I|e \u2208 E(\u0393)}) by identifying the\nequivalent classes: (s, 0) \u223c pe (s) for (s, 0) \u2208 Se \u00d7 0, pe (s) \u2208 Fo(e) ; (s, 1) \u223c pe (s) for\n\n\f5\n(s, 1) \u2208 Se \u00d7 1, pe (s) \u2208 Ft(e) . The fundamental group of the graph of surfaces \u03c01 (S\u0393)\nis defined to be the fundamental group of the total space S\u0393 . There is a projection\nmap \u03c0 : S\u0393 \u2192 \u0393 such that each vertex surface Fv maps to the vertex v and each\nSe \u00d7 I maps to the edge e, \u03c0 is an onto map.\nf of S\u0393 is a union of copies of the universal covers See \u00d7I and\nThe universal cover S\u0393\nfv . In S\u0393,\nf if we identify each copy of F\nfv to a point and each copy of See \u00d7 I to a copy\nF\nf \u2192 t. It\nof I, then we obtain a graph t and there is a canonical projection map \u03c0\ne : S\u0393\nis not hard to see that t is a tree, called the Bass-Serre tree. The action of \u03c01 (S\u0393) on\nf descends to an action of \u03c01 (S\u0393) on t, where the quotient graph coincides with the\nS\u0393\noriginal graph \u0393, and the stabilizers of each vertex and each edge of t are conjugates\nof corresponding fundamental groups of Fv and Se .\nThe Bestvina \u2013 Feighn Combination Theorem (The material in this subsection\ncan be found in [BF92])\nFor the purpose of this paper, instead of the original combination theorem, we\nshall state the tailored Bestvina-Feighn Combination Theorem in the context of the\ngraphs of surfaces only.\nLet S\u0393 be a graph of surfaces with the underlying graph \u0393, and let \u03c0 : S\u0393 \u2192 \u0393\nbe the projection map. Denote the preimage of the midpoint of an edge e \u2208 \u0393 under\np by Se . For a vertex v \u2208 \u0393, we consider the component containing v of \u0393 cut open\nalong the midpoints of edges. Let Xv denote the preimage of this component under\np, called vertex space. For any vertex v \u2208 \u0393, the vertex surface Fv is a deformation\nretract of the vertex space Xv .\nFor each edge e of \u0393, the lift to the universal covers of the finite index covering\nmap pe : Se \u2192 Fo(e) is a quasi-isometry. This is precisely the 'quasi-isometrically\nembedded condition' in [BF92]. We may omit this condition from the hypothesis of\nthe combination theorem for the cases of the graphs of surfaces.\nf to be a hallway of length 2k,\nDefine a continuous function \u2206 : [\u2212k, k] \u00d7 I \u2192 S\u0393\nif for any i from \u2212k to k, \u2206({i} \u00d7 I) is a geodesic in See(i) , and \u2206((i, i + 1) \u00d7 I)\nev(i) .

The girth\nof \u2206 is the length of \u2206({0} \u00d7 I). Let \u03bb > 1.

(Combination Theorem) Let S\u0393 be a graph of surfaces. Suppose that S\u0393\nsatisfies the hallways flare condition, then the fundamental group of S\u0393 is hyperbolic.\nRemarks: 1. Notice that in the Bestvina-Feighn's combination theorem, the vertex\nspaces are used in defining the hallways; but in the proof of Theorem 1, we use the\nvertex surfaces instead. We are allowed to do so, because the vertex surface is a\n\n\f6\nretraction of the corresponding vertex space, and their universal covers are quasiisometric to each other.\n2. The hallways in the combination theorem are 'edge hallways', i.e., the rungs\n\u2206(i) \u00d7 I of the hallway \u2206 are geodesics in the edge surfaces. In Theorem 1, the\nhallways are 'vertex hallways', i.e., \u2206(i)\u00d7I are geodesics in the vertex surfaces. Since\nthe covering map from an edge surface to a vertex space is a quasi-isometry, and the\nvertex spaces and the vertex surfaces are quasi-isometric, if the vertex hallways flare\ncondition is satisfied then the edge hallways flare condition is satisfied.\n3. For the cases studied in this paper, we will prove the hallways flares condition\nfor length 2 hallways only.\nConstruction of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms (The materials is covered\nby [Pen88])\nIn a surface S, C is an essential curve system, if C = {c1 , * * * , cn }, where\nc1 , * * * , cn are non-trivial simple closed curves on S which are pairwise disjoint\nand pairwise non-homotopy.\nLet C and D be two disjoint essential curve systems, C hits D efficiently if C\nintersect D transversely, and no component on S\\(C \u222a D) is a bigon, an interior of a\ndisc whose boundary consists of one arc of C \u2208 C and one arc of D \u2208 D. We say that\nC \u222a D fills S if the components of the complement of (C \u222a D) are disks.\nThe following shows how to construct pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.\nTheorem 3. ([Pen88]) Suppose that C and D are essential curve systems in an\noriented surface F so that C hits D efficiently and C \u222a D fills F . Let R(C + , D \u2212 )\nbe the free semigroup generated by the Dehn twists {\u03c4c+ : c \u2208 C} \u222a {\u03c4d\u22121 : d \u2208 D}.\nEach component map of the isotopy class of \u03c9 \u2208 R(C + , D \u2212 ) is either the identity or\npseudo-Anosov, and the isotopy class of \u03c9 is itself pseudo-Anosov if each \u03c4c+ and \u03c4d\u22121\noccur at least once in \u03c9.\nSurface group extensions (The materials is covered by [Mos] and [FM02c])\nA surface group extension is a short exact sequence of the form\n1 \u2192 \u03c01 (S, x) \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 G \u2192 1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S is a closed, oriented surface of genus g \u2265 2.

We are\nmore interested in the case where \u03b1 is an inclusion.\nVirtual centralizer of \u03a6 (The material is covered by [Mos])\nGiven a subgroup H of a group G, the virtual centralizer V C(H) of H in G is\nthe subgroup of all g \u2208 G which commute with a finite index subgroup of H. The\nvirtual centralizer of an infinite cyclic pseudo-Anosov subgroup has a nice geometric\ndescription. Let PML(S) denote the space of projective measured laminations of\nthe surface S. Let \u039bs , \u039bu \u2282 PML be the fixed points of a pseudo-Anosov mapping\nclass \u03a6, and let F ix{\u039bs , \u039bu } denote the subgroup in MCG(S) whose elements fix\n\u039bs , \u039bu point wise. [Mos] shows that F ix{\u039bs , \u039bu } = V Ch\u03a6i.\nFacts of hyperbolic geometry (The material is covered by [BH99] and [CB])\nOur proofs make heavy use of the following facts of hyperbolic space, H 2 , geometry:\nFact 1. For any 0 < \u03b4 < 1, and D > 0, there exists l(\u03b4, D), such that if \u03b3, \u03b1 are\ngeodesic segments of length at least l(\u03b4, D), and the end points x, y of \u03b3 have distance\nat most D from the end points x\u2032 , y \u2032 of \u03b1 respectively, then there exist subsegments\n\u03b3 \u2032 \u2282 \u03b3, \u03b1\u2032 \u2282 \u03b1 of lengths at least (1 \u2212 \u03b4)Length(\u03b3) and (1 \u2212 \u03b4)Length(\u03b1) respectively,\nsuch that the Hausdorff distance between \u03b3 \u2032 and \u03b1\u2032 is less than \u03b4.\nRoughly speaking, for any two geodesic segments, if their end points have bounded\ndistances from each other, then most part of them can be arbitrarily close to each\nother as long as the segments are long enough.\nFact 2. Given k \u2265 1, c \u2265 0, there exists a constant N0 (k, c), such that any (k, c)\nquasi-geodesics line or segment in H 2 has Hausdorff distance at most N0 (k, c) from a\ngeodesic line or segment with the same end points.\nFact 3. Let \u039b1 and \u039b2 be two minimal geodesic laminations filling a hyperbolic\ne 1 and \u039b\ne 2 on the universal cover of Se have at least one end\nsurface S. If their lifts \u039b\npoint in common, then \u039b1 = \u039b2 . A geodesic lamination \u039b is minimal if every leaf L\nis dense, that is, L = \u039b. A geodesic lamination \u039b \u2282 S is a filling lamination if no\nsimple closed curve in S is disjoint from \u039b.\nThe reason is that two minimal filling surface geodesic laminations either transversely intersect with each other or are equal to each other.\nFrom [FLP+ 79], we know that the stable and unstable geodesic laminations of a\npseudo-Anosov homeomorphism are minimal and filling.\n\n3\n\nMain Theorem\n\nWe will give a new version of Mosher's parallel corresponds lemma and use it to prove\nTheorem 1. Moreover we will reformulate the hypothesis of Theorem 1. The original\ncorresponds lemma of Mosher is in [Mos97].\n\n\f8\n\n3.1\n\nNew version of the parallel corresponds lemma\n\nConsider a pseudo-Anosov mapping class \u03a6 \u2282 MCG(S), let \u03c6 \u2208 Homeo(S) be a\npseudo-Anosov representative with the stable and unstable measured foliations f\u03c6s , f\u03c6u .\nRecall that the transverse measures on f\u03c6s and f\u03c6u define a singular Euclidean structure\non S, with isolated cone singularities. We call the leaves of f\u03c6s the horizontal leaves\nand the leaves of f\u03c6u the vertical leaves. The singular Euclidean structure determines\na metric d\u03c6 on S for which each path can be homotopic to a unique geodesic rel end\npoints. The lifts to the universal covers of the hyperbolic metric and the singular\nEuclidean metric are quasi-isometric equivalent.\nIn the following, for a homotopy class \u03b3 of a curve rel. end points, let \u03b3 h denote\nthe hyperbolic geodesic segment in the homotopy class of \u03b3, and let \u03b3 E denote the\nsingular Euclidean geodesic segment in the same homotopy class. Let | * | denote\nthe hyperbolic metric, and let | * |E denote the singular Euclidean metric. For a\nhomotopy class \u03b3, let |\u03b3| denote the hyperbolic length of \u03b3 h , let |\u03b3|E denotes the\nsingular Euclidean length of \u03b3 E .\nGiven 0 < \u03b7 < 1, define slope\u03b7\u03c6 to be the set of all homotopy classes \u03b3, such that\nthe (unsigned) Euclidean angle between \u03b3 E and f\u03c6s is at least \u03b7, on a subset of \u03b3 E of\nlength at least \u03b7 * Length \u03b3 E . Given \u03bb > 1, let stretch\u03bb\u03c6 = {\u03b3 | |(\u03c6(\u03b3))| > \u03bb|\u03b3|}. Let\nn be a large enough integer, such that if the vector v \u2208 E 2 has an angle at least \u03b7\nwith the horizontal axis, then the matrix\n\u0012 \u2212n\n\u0013\n\u03bb\u03c6\n0\n0 \u03bbn\u03c6\nstretches v by a factor of at least \u03bb/\u03b7, where \u03bb\u03c6 = limi\u2192\u221e |\u03c6i (\u03b1)|1/i is the stretching\nfactor of \u03c6, \u03b1 is a simple closed geodesic on S. Since the singular Euclidean metric\nis quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic metric, it follows that given \u03c6, 0 < \u03b7 < 1, and\n\u03bb > 1, there exists N such that if n \u2265 N, then slope\u03b7\u03c6 \u2282 stretch\u03bb\u03c6n .\nAn \u03b7-lever is a homotopy from a singular Euclidean geodesic segment \u03b1 to a horizontal segment \u03b2, where \u03b2 is a segment of a nonsingular leaf of the horizontal foliation\nf\u03c6s , such that each track of the homotopy is a vertical geodesic segment, maybe degenerate, and each point of int(\u03b1) is disjoint from singularities during the homotopy,\nand int(\u03b1) makes an angle at most \u03b7 with the horizontal leaves. In [Mos97], \u03b2 is not\nnecessary to be a segment of a nonsingular leaf. But we can always make \u03b2 be a segment of a nonsingular leaf, because there exist nonsingular leafs which are arbitrary\nclose to a singular leaf. Notice that the angle between a singular Euclidean geodesic\nand the horizontal leaves changes only when the singular Euclidean geodesic passes a\nsingularity. Therefore the interior of \u03b1 has a constant angle with the horizontal leaf.\nA lever is denoted by (\u03b1, \u03b2), where \u03b1 is called the inclined edge of the lever, and \u03b2\nis called the horizontal edge of the lever. A lever is maximal if and only if a singularity\ncontained in the track of each end point of \u03b1. The length of the lever is |\u03b1|E , the\nheight of the lever is the maximum length of the tracks of the points of \u03b1, which is\nachieved at the endpoints.\nProposition 4. For any l, H > 0, there exists \u03b7(l, H) > 0, so that every maximal\n\u03b7-lever has length at least l and height at most H.\n\n\f9\nThe proof is given in the first seven paragraphs of the proof of the sublemma on\npage 3451 in [Mos97]. This proposition will be used in the proof of the following\nlemma.\nIn the proof of the following lemma, we need some facts. It is well known that the\nmeasured foliations f\u03c6s , f\u03c6u can be straightened to measured geodesic laminations l\u03c6s ,\nl\u03c6u . Actually, there is a 1-1 correspondence between leaves of l\u03c6s and smooth leaves of\nf\u03c6s , where a smooth leaf is either a nonsingular leaf or the union of two singular halfleaves meeting at a singularity with angle 1800 . Similarly for f\u03c6u . The singularities\nare discrete, so the length of any geodesic between them has a positive lower bound.\nLemma 5. (New version of Parallel Corresponds lemma) Given any pseudo-Anosov\nhomeomorphism \u03c6 and 0 < \u01eb < 1, there exist 0 < \u03b7 < 1 and L > 0 such that for\nany homotopy class \u03b3, if \u03b3 \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6 and |\u03b3|E \u2265 L, then on a subset of \u03b3 h of length\nat least (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Length(\u03b3 h ), the distance between the tangent line of \u03b3 h and the set l\u03c6s ,\nmeasured in P S, is at most \u01eb.\nThe differences between the Parallel Corresponds lemma in [Mos97] and this new\nversion are as follows. In [Mos97], the Parallel corresponds lemma works only for\nclosed based geodesics, and the word metric is used to define the stretching factor; in\nthis paper, the new version of the parallel corresponds lemma works for non closed\ngeodesics as well, and the hyperbolic metric is used to define the stretching factor.\nProof. The first step is to find long subsegments \u03b1i \u2282 \u03b3 E and segments \u03b2i of leaves\nof f\u03c6s , such that \u03b1i is homotopic to \u03b2i by homotoping through short paths. Then we\nshall project \u03b1i to a subsegment of \u03b3 h and project \u03b2i to a segment of a leaf Bih of l\u03c6s ,\nand show that a big portion of these projections are very close to each other. Finally\nwe shall prove most part of \u03b3 h are covered by big portion of these projections.\nFor \u03b3 \u2208\n/ Slope\u03b7\u03c6 , let {(\u03b1i , \u03b2i )} be the set of all maximal \u03b7-levers of \u03b3 E , where the\ninclined edge \u03b1i is a subsegment of \u03b3 E and the horizontal edge \u03b2i is a segment of\nsome non-singular leaf BiE of f\u03c6s .\nStep 1: first, let H = 1, by proposition 4, we know that for any l > 0, there exists\n\u03b7 > 0 such that every maximal \u03b7-lever {(\u03b1i , \u03b2i )} has length at lest l and height at\nmost H = 1. The first step is proven.\nStep 2: we shall construct long subsegments of \u03b3 h from the inclined edges \u03b1i \u2282 \u03b3 E\nof the maximal levers, such that these long subsegments of \u03b3 h have small distance\nwith l\u03c6s measured in P S. In the rest of this lemma, the distance and length mean\nhyperbolic distance and length, otherwise we will use the notations Euclidean distance\nand length. I will use the notation \"E\" to represent the Euclidean distance and length.\nWe know that any non-singular leaf BiE of f\u03c6s is a k, c quasi-geodesic under the\nhyperbolic metric, and it can be straightened to a unique leaf Bih of l\u03c6s . Let \u03b4i \u2282 \u03b3 h\nand \u03c3i \u2282 Bih denote the closest point projections from \u03b1i \u2282 \u03b3 E to \u03b3 h , and from\n\u03b2i \u2282 BiE to Bih respectively. We shall see that most portion of \u03b4i has small distance\nwith \u03c3i , for all i.\nSince \u03b3 E is a k, c quasi-geodesic segment contained in the N0 (k, c) neighborhood\nof \u03b3 h , and \u03b4i , \u03b1i are subsegments of \u03b3 h , \u03b3 E respectively, it follows that the distances\n\n\f10\nbetween the end points of \u03b4i and \u03b1i are not greater than N0 . For the same reason, the\ndistance between the end points of \u03c3i and \u03b2i are not greater than N0 . The singular\nEuclidean distances between the end points of \u03b2i and \u03b1i is less than the height H = 1.\nThe hyperbolic distances between the end point of them are at most mk for some\nm > 0, because the singular Euclidean and hyperbolic metric are k, c quasi-isometric\nto each other. Therefore the distances between the end points of \u03b4i and \u03c3i are less\nthan 2N0 + mk. According to Fact 1, for any \u01eb1 > 0, there exists L1 depending on\n2N0 + mk and \u01eb1 , if the length of \u03b4i is greater than L1 , then more than (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )|\u03b4i |\npart of \u03b4i has distance less than \u01eb1 with \u03c3i .\nThe condition on the length of \u03b4i greater than L1 is easy to satisfy. Since \u03b1i is\na quasi-geodesic segment whose end points have distances less than N0 with the end\npoints of \u03b4i , there exists l1 > 0, such that if the Euclidean length of \u03b1i is greater\nthat l1 , then the length of \u03b4i is greater than L1 . By applying the step 1, we may now\nchoose \u03b7 small enough, so that the Euclidean length of \u03b1i is greater than l1 for any i.\nTherefore more than (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )|\u03b4i | part of \u03b4i has distance less than \u01eb1 with \u03c3i .\nSo far, we have proved that for any \u01eb1 , there exists \u03b7, such that if \u03b3 \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6 , then\nwe can locate long subsegments \u03b4i of \u03b3 h , such that more than (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) of the length\nof \u03b4i has distance less than \u01eb1 with \u03c3i \u2282P\nBih , for any i.\nStep 3: we will prove\nmost part of \u03b3 h .\nP that (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) i |\u03b4i | part of \u222ai (\u03b4i ) covers\nh\nWe call this (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) i |\u03b4i | part of \u222ai (\u03b4i ) the 'good' part of \u03b3 .\nSince \u03b3 \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6 , on a subset of \u03b3 E of length at least (1 \u2212 \u03b7)|\u03b3|E , the angle\nbetween \u03b3 E and f\u03c6s is less than \u03b7, i.e., the \u03b7-levers cover more than (1 \u2212 \u03b7) part of \u03b3 E .\nThe worst situation is that the two end subsegments of \u03b3 E are covered by \u03b7-levers\nwith lengths less than l1 . In this case, after straightening, the end subsegments of \u03b3 h\nmay not have distances less than \u01eb1 with B h . We will only prove this lemma for the\nworst situation, i.e., more than (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )|\u03b3|E part of \u03b3 E is covered by the union of the\nmaximal \u03b7-levers (\u03b1i , \u03b2i ) and two end \u03b7-levers which cover the two end segments of\n\u03b3 E respectively and with lengths less than l1 .\nIn the following the quasi-isometries will be replaced by bi-Lipschitz maps when\ndealing with long segments. In the rest of this proof, let |\u03b1i | denote the length of the\nhyperbolic geodesic which is homotopic to \u03b1i rel. end points, and let |\u03b1i |E denote the\nEuclidean length of the singular Euclidean geodesic \u03b1i . Keep in mind that none of\nthe following \u03b4i is the projection of an end subsegment of \u03b3 E .\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\n\nX\n\n|\u03b4i | \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )(\n\ni\n\nX\n\n(|\u03b1i | \u2212 2N0 ))\n\ni\n\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )(\n\nX |\u03b1i |E\n(\n\u2212 2N0 ))\nk\ni\n\nAccording to Proposition 4, we can take \u03b7 to be small enough, so that |\u03b1i |E \u2265 l2 =\n4kN0 for any i\nP\n|\u03b1i |E\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) i\n2k\n\n\f11\nSince the union of the \u03b7-levers-the maximal \u03b7-levers and the two end \u03b7-levers, covers\nmore than (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )|\u03b3|E part of \u03b3 E , and we suppose that the two end \u03b7-levers have\nlengths less than l1 ,\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\n\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )|\u03b3|E \u2212 2l1\n2k\n\nTake |\u03b3|E to be long enough, so that |\u03b3|E \u2265 L2 =\n\n2l1\n\u01eb1\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u01eb1 )|\u03b3|E\n2k\n2\n(1 \u2212 2\u01eb1 ) |\u03b3|E\n\u2265\n2k\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\n\nP\n2\n1 ) |\u03b3|E\nHence, (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) i |\u03b4i | \u2265 (1\u22122\u01eb2k\n.\nThe 'bad' parts of \u03b3 h are of three kinds. The first kind of bad part is the two end\nsubsegments of \u03b3 h which have lengths less than L1 . The sum of the lengths of the\nend subsegments of \u03b3 h is at most 2L1 . We can take |\u03b3|E to be big enough such that\n2L1 \u2264 \u01eb1 |\u03b3|E .\nThe second kind of bad part of \u03b3 h is the \u01eb1 |\u03b4i | part of \u03b4i 's which may be out of\nthe \u01eb1 neighborhood of \u03c3i . Since the projection map can not prolong length, and the\ndistances between the ends of \u03b1i and \u03b4i are not greater than N0 ,\nX\n\n\u01eb1 |\u03b4i | \u2264 \u01eb1\n\ni\n\nX\n\n(|\u03b1i | + 2N0 )\n\ni\n\nWe can take \u03b7 to be small enough, so that |\u03b1i |E \u2265 l2 = 4kN0 for any i. The\nsingular Euclidean metric and the hyperbolic metric are k bi-Lipschitz shows that\n|\u03b1i |E \u2264 k|\u03b1i |. Therefore 2N0 \u2264 2kN0 \u2264 |\u03b12i |\n3X\n|\u03b1i |\n2 i\n3 X\n\u2264 \u01eb1 k\n|\u03b1i |E\n2 i\n\n\u2264 \u01eb1\n\n\u2264 \u01eb1 2k|\u03b3|E\nThe third kind of bad part of \u03b3 h are the projections of \u01eb1 |\u03b3|E part of \u03b3 E which has\nslope greater than \u01eb1 with f\u03c6s . Let \u03bei denote this kind of subsegment of \u03b3 E . There is a\nlower bound b of the Euclidean lengths of \u03bei for all i, which equals the minimum of the\nEuclidean distances between\nP singularities. The\nP sum of the lengths of the\nPprojections\nh\nfrom \u03bei to \u03b3 is at most i (k|\u03bei |E + c) \u2264 i (k|\u03bei |E + (n \u2212 1)kb) \u2264 n i (k|\u03bei |E ) \u2264\nnk\u01eb1 |\u03b3|E , for some n satisfies c \u2264 (n \u2212 1)kb.\n\n\f12\nTherefore, the length of the 'bad' part of \u03b3 h is at most the sum of the above three\nkinds, which is (2k + 1 + nk)\u01eb1 |\u03b3|E . Hence the ratio of the 'good' part of \u03b3 h to the\n(1\u22122\u01eb1 )2\n. It is easy to see, for any constant \u01eb there\n'bad' part of \u03b3 h is at least 2k(1+2k+nk)\u01eb\n1\nexists a small enough \u01eb1 , such that the ratio of the 'good' part of \u03b3 h to \u03b3 h is at least\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb).\n(1\u22122\u01eb1 )2\nis\nTo recap: for any \u01eb > 0, we can choose small enough \u01eb1 , so that 2k(1+2k+nk)\u01eb\n1\nh\ngreater than 1 \u2212 \u01eb, therefore the 'good' part of \u03b3 covers more than (1 \u2212 \u01eb) of the\ntotal length of \u03b3 h . Then choose \u03b7 small enough so that if \u03b3 E \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6 , then more\nthan (1 \u2212 \u01eb)|\u03b4i | part of \u03b4i has distance less than \u01eb1 with \u03c3i . In addition, take |\u03b3|E to\nbe at least L, where L = max{L2 , 2L1 /\u01eb1 }. Hence if \u03b7 is small enough, \u03b3 \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6\nand |\u03b3|E \u2265 L, then most part of \u03b3 h has distance at most \u01eb to l\u03c6s , measured in P S.\nGiven a geodesic lamination \u039b and 0 < \u01eb < 1, let W N\u01eb (\u039b) denote the set of all\nthe homotopy class \u03b3, so that on a subset of \u03b3 h of length at least (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Length(\u03b3 h ),\nthe distance from the tangent line of \u03b3 h to the set \u039b, measured in P S, is at most \u01eb.\nUsing this notation, the parallel corresponds lemma says that for any 0 < \u01eb < 1, there\nexists 0 < \u03b7 < 1 and L > 0, such that if \u03b3 \u2208\n/ slope\u03b7\u03c6 and |\u03b3|E \u2265 L, then \u03b3 \u2208 W N\u01eb (\u039bs ),\nwhere \u039bs is the measured stable geodesic lamination of \u03c6.\n\n3.2\n\nProof of the main theorem\n\nProof of Theorem 1. We shall prove that there exist \u03bb > 1 and C > 0, so that for\nany vertex w \u2208 \u0393, if a based geodesic segment \u03b3wh \u2282 Fw has length at least C, then\ni\nall but at most one preimages of it are stretched by corresponding \u03c6m\nby a factor of\ni\nat least \u03bb, for any i \u2208 Iw , where Iw = {i| ei is an oriented edge such that the origin\nof ei is w}. Hence the hallways flare condition is satisfied. Therefore S\u0393\u03c6m is a\nhyperbolic surface.\nLet vSbe a vertex of \u0393, let \u03b3vh \u2282 Fv be a based geodesic segment. Consider the\n\u22121 h\nh\nh\nset \u03a3 = i\u2208Iv p\u22121\ni (\u03b3v ), where pi (\u03b3v ) is the set of all preimages of \u03b3v under the map\npi . Notice that all the elements of \u03a3 are based geodesics, since the edge surfaces of\nS\u0393\u03c6m equipped with the pullback metrics.\nFirst, we claim that there exist 0 < \u01eb0 < 1 and H0 > 0, such that if the length\nh\nof \u03b3vh is greater than H0 , then at most one of the elements of \u03a3, say \u03b2 \u2208 p\u22121\ni0 (\u03b3v ),\ns\nsuch that \u03b2 \u2208 W N\u01eb0 (\u039bi0 ), for some i0 \u2208 Iv ; all other elements of \u03a3 are not contained\nin W N\u01eb (\u039bsi ) for corresponding \u039bsi . Second, according to Lemma 5, for this \u01eb0 , there\nexist 0 < \u03b7(\u01eb0 ) < 1 and L(\u01eb0 ) > 0, such that any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a3 with length |\u03b1| = |\u03b3vh | greater\nm\n\u03b7(\u01eb )\nthan L(\u01eb0 ), if \u03b1 \u2208\n/ W N\u01eb0 (\u039bsj ), then \u03b1 \u2208 slope\u03c6j 0 . Therefore \u03b1 is stretched by \u03c6j j by\na factor of at least \u03bb for sufficiently large mj . Combining these, we know that for any\n\u03b3vh with length greater C = max{H, L(\u01eb0 )}, all but at most one preimages of \u03b3vh are\ni\nstretched by corresponding \u03c6m\nby at least a factor \u03bb.\ni\nSuppose the claim is not true. Namely for any \u01ebn \u2192 0, and any Hn \u2192 \u221e, there\nexist based geodesic segments \u03b3nh \u2282 Fv with lengths at least Hn , by passing to a\n\u22121 h\nh\nh\nsubsequence, without loss of generality, suppose Ahn \u2208 p\u22121\n1 (\u03b3n ) and Bn \u2208 p2 (\u03b3n ),\n\n\f13\nsuch that Ahn \u2208 W N\u01ebn (\u039bs1 ) and Bnh \u2208 W N\u01ebn (\u039bs2 ). Project Ahn and Bnh to \u039bs1 and\n\u039bs2 respectively, there exist long subsegments \u03bdn \u2282 \u039bs1 and \u03c9n \u2282 \u039bs2 , such that |\u03bdn |,\n|\u03c9n | \u2192 \u221e, and the distance between Dp1 |T \u03bdn and Dp2 |T \u03c9n converges to zero. This\nconflicts with the fact that Dp1 |T \u039bs1 and Dp2 |T \u039bs2 are disjoint.\n\n3.3\n\nReformulation of Theorem 1\n\nNotations here are the same as in the introduction.

(Farb & Mosher [FM02a],Theorem 1.2) Let \u03c01 (S) be the fundamental\ngroup of a surface S, and let \u0393\u03b1 be the surface group extension of a group G. If \u0393\u03b1 is\nword hyperbolic then the homomorphism \u03b1 : G \u2192 MCG has finite kernel and convex\ncocompact image.\n\nCorollary 8. Let G, H be finite subgroups of MCG(S), and let \u03a6 \u2208 MCG(S)\nbe a pseudo-Anosov mapping class. If the virtual centralizer of h\u03a6i has trivial intersection with G and H, then hG, \u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M i is a free product in MCG(S), i.e.,\nhG, \u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M i \u223c\n= G\u2217\u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M , and its extension group is hyperbolic, for sufficiently\nlarge M.\nRemark: if G is a finite subgroup of MCG(S), then G has a faithful representation, still called G \u2282 Homeo(S). The quotient S/G, called F0 , is a hyperbolic\nsurface or orbifold. There exists a canonical embedding i : PML(F0 ) \u0592\u2192 PML(S),\nwhere PML is the projective measured geodesic laminations space.

Therefore, it is very easy to find \u03a6 \u2282 MCG(S) which satisfies the hypothesis of\nthis corollary.\nProof. Let the symbols G, H denote both the finite groups of MCG(S) and their\nfaithful representations in Homeo(S). Let F0 = S/G, F1 = S/H.

Since G and \u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M are finite groups,\nby applying Theorem 3.11 of Scott and Wall [SW79], a normal subgroup of G \u2217\n\u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M must be trivial or finite index. Therefore \u03b4 is an injection, which tells us\nthat hG, \u03a6M H\u03a6M i \u223c\n= G \u2217 \u03a6M H\u03a6\u2212M .\nIn order to prove \u03c01 (G\u0393) is word hyperbolic, we only need to show that S\u0393 is a\nhyperbolic graph of surfaces.\n\n\f15\nLet y \u2208 F0 be the base point, let {x1 , * * * , xr } = p\u22121 (y) denote the preimages\nof y under the covering map p, and let x\nei \u2208 Se be a covering point of xi for i \u2208\ne\ne\n{1, * * * , r}.

Denote the lift of \u03c6m : S \u2192 S through i as \u03b6 : G \u2192 G, and the\nlift of \u03c6\u2212m through j as \u03c3 : G \u2192 G. Notice that Ls is the stable geodesic lamination\nof \u03b6, Lu is the stable geodesic lamination of \u03c3. Since Ls = Lu , there exist positive\nintegers k1 , k2 , such that \u03b6 k1 is homotopic to \u03c3 k2 .\nSince \u03b6 k1 is homotopic to \u03c3 k2 and pi = qj, we know: pi\u03b6 k1 is homotopic to qj\u03c3 k2 .\np\u03c6k1 m i is homotopic to q\u03c6\u2212k2m j, because \u03c6k1 m i = i\u03b6 k1 and \u03c6\u2212k2 m j = j\u03c3 k1 .\np(c) is a notation for the closed curve p(c) : S 1 \u2192 F which is the composition of\nc : S 1 \u2192 S with the covering map p : S \u2192 F . Similar notations are used for other\ncompositions of closed curves with covering maps. c2 : S 1 \u2192 S is defined to be the\ncomposition of the map z \u2192 z 2 on the unit circle S 1 with map c : S 1 \u2192 S. Let [a],\n[c] denote the conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of F which represented by\nthe simple closed curve a, c.\nSince p(c) is homotopic to a2 and q(c) is homotopic to a, it tells us that [a] \u2208\n/\n2\np\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)), [a] \u2208 q\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)), and [a] \u2208 p\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)) \u2229 q\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)). Hence there exists\n\u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 G which is homotopic to a simple closed curve, such that i(\u03b3) is homotopic\nto c and j(\u03b3) is homotopic to c2 . Therefore p\u03c6k1 m (c), p\u03c6k1 m i(\u03b3), q\u03c6\u2212k2 m j(\u03b3) and\nq\u03c6\u2212k2 m (c2 ) are homotopic to each other.\n\n\f17\nWe claim that q\u03c6\u2212k2 m (c) is homotopic to a simple closed curve on F . Let \u03b2 be the\nclosed geodesic on F which is homotopic to q\u03c6\u2212k2 m (c). If \u03b2 is not simple, then there\nexits a point z \u2208 \u03b2(S 1), and a simple closed curve \u03b1 : S 1 \u2192 S which is homotopic to\n\u03c6\u2212k2 m (c), such that q(\u03b1) = \u03b2, and there exit two points x1 6= x2 \u2208 \u03b1(S 1 ) such that\nq(x1 ) = q(x2 ) = z. Since p\u03c6k1 m (c) is homotopic to q\u03c6\u2212k2m (c2 ), there exists a simple\nclosed curve \u03b7 from S 1 to S which is homotopic to \u03c6k1 m (c), and whose image under\nthe map p goes around \u03b2 twice, to be more precise, p(\u03b7) = \u03b2 2 . It follows that there are\nfour different points y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 \u2208 \u03b7(S 1 ) such that p(y1 ) = p(y2 ) = p(y3 ) = p(y4 ) = z,\nwhich conflicts with the fact that p : S \u2192 F is an index 2 covering map.\nBy iterating, we have:\npi\u03b6 nk1 is homotopic to qj\u03c3 nk2 , for all n \u2208 N\np\u03c6nk1 m i(\u03b3) is homotopic to q\u03c6\u2212nk2 m j(\u03b3), for all n \u2208 N\np\u03c6nk1m (c) is homotopic to q\u03c6\u2212nk2m (c2 ), for all n \u2208 N\nBy using the same argument, we know q\u03c6\u2212nk2 m (c) is homotopic to a simple closed\ncurve on F , for all n \u2208 N. Let \u03b1n denote the geodesics in the free homotopy class of\n\u03c6\u2212nk2 m (c), there exists a subsequence of \u03b1n , without loss of generality, still call it \u03b1n ,\nsuch that \u03b1n \u2192 \u039bu as n \u2192 \u221e. Since q\u03c6\u2212nk2 m (c) is homotopic to a simple closed curve\non F for all n, the geodesics in the free homotopic classes of q\u03c6\u2212nk2 m (c) converge to\na geodesic lamination \u0398 \u2282 F , by passing to a subsequence. It follows that q(\u039bu ) is a\ngeodesic lamination.\nNotice that in the proof, we can only lift \u03c6m : S \u2192 S by i and j to homeomore s ) and \u2202e\ne u ) for any i, j \u2208\nphisms of G for some m \u2208 N, but the end points of \u2202e\npi ( \u039b\nqj (\u039b\ne s ), \u2202e\ne s ), \u2202e\ne u ),\n{1, 2} do not depend on m. Therefore we have proved that {\u2202e\np1 ( \u039b\np2 ( \u039b\nq1 (\u039b\ne u )} is a pairwise disjoint set. According to Theorem 6, we know \u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is hy\u2202e\nq2 (\u039b\nperbolic for sufficiently large m.\n\n5\n\nAn example which is not abstractly commensurate to a surface-by-free group\n\nIn this section, we will show that there exist a graph of surfaces whose fundamental\ngroup is hyperbolic, but is not abstractly commensurate to any surface-by-free group,\nfor any closed hyperbolic surface or orbifold S \u2032 and any free group K. Therefore this\ngroup is different from all the groups constructed in [Mos97]. By applying Theorem\n1.1 in [FM02b], it follows that the example constructed here is not even quasi-isometric\nto any surface-by-free group.\nRecall that, groups G and H are called abstractly commensurate, if there exist\nfinite index subgroups G1 < G and H1 < H, so that G1 is isomorphic to H1 . A group\nG is called a surface-by-free group, if there is a hyperbolic surface or a hyperbolic\norbifold S, and a free group K, such that there exists a short exact sequence:\n\n\f18\n\n1 \u2192 \u03c01 (S) \u2192 G \u2192 K \u2192 1\nFirst, we shall give a necessary and sufficient condition for a group to be abstractly commensurate to a surface-by-free group. Second, we shall construct a nonhyperbolic graph of surfaces G, by applying the condition, whose fundamental group\nis not abstract commensurate to any surface-by-free group. Finally, we shall construct a hyperbolic graph of surfaces G\u03c6m from G such that \u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is not abstractly\ncommensurate to any surface-by-free group.\nLet t denote the Bass-Serre tree of a graph of surfaces S\u0393, and let V, E denote\nthe set of all the vertices and edges of t respectively. \u03c01 (S\u0393) acts on t with subgroups\nstab(v) and stab(e), which stabilize the vertex v \u2208 V and the edge e \u2208 E respectively.\nLemma 10. The fundamental group of a graph of surfaces S\u0393 is abstractly commensurate to a surface-by-free group if and only if [stab(v) : \u2229w\u2208V stab(w)] < \u221e, for any\nv \u2208 V.\nProof. According to [FM02b], a finite index subgroup of a surface-by-free group is\na surface-by-free group. If \u03c01 (S\u0393) is abstractly commensurate to a surface-by-free\ngroup, then there exists a finite index subgroup of H of \u03c01 (S\u0393) which is isomorphic\nto a surface-by-free group.\nH acts on t, and [stab(v) : H \u2229 stab(v)] \u2264 [\u03c01 (S\u0393) : H] is finite. H acts on t\nwith compact quotient, t may be identified with the Bass-Serre tree of H. Since H is\nisomorphic to a surface-by-free group \u03c01 (S \u2032 ) \u22ca F , where S \u2032 is a hyperbolic surface, F\nis a finite rank free group, there exists a normal subgroup N of H which is isomorphic\nto \u03c01 (S \u2032 ), such that N acts trivially on t.\nLet N denote \u2229w\u2208V (stab(w) \u2229 H) which is a finite index subgroup of stab(v) \u2229 H\nfor any vertex v \u2208 t, i.e., [stab(v) \u2229 H : \u2229w\u2208V (stab(w) \u2229 H)] < \u221e. Therefore:\n[stab(v) : \u2229w\u2208V stab(w)] < [stab(v) : \u2229w\u2208V (stab(w) \u2229 H)]\n= [stab(v) : H \u2229 stab(v)][H \u2229 stab(v) : \u2229w\u2208V (stab(w) \u2229 H)] < \u221e.\nWe have finished the proof for one direction.\nNow we will prove the other direction. The action of \u03c01 (S\u0393) on t induces a\nhomomorphism \u03c3 : \u03c01 (S\u0393) \u2192 Aut(t). Let K = \u2229w\u2208V stab(w), K = ker(\u03c3). Since K\nis a finite index subgroup of stab(v) for any v \u2208 V , \u03c01 (S\u0393)/K acts on t with finite\nedge and vertex stabilizers. In addition \u03c01 (S\u0393)/K acts on t cocompactly. Therefore\nt/(\u03c01 (S\u0393)/K) is a finite graph of finite groups. Applying Theorem 7.3 in [SW79], it\nfollows that \u03c01 (S\u0393)/K is virtually free. Hence \u03c01 (S\u0393) is abstractly commensurate to\na surface-by-free group.\nIn the rest of this paper, let G denote a graph of surfaces as in Figure 5, where S,\nF , p, q and the simple closed curves c \u2282 S, a \u2282 F are as described in Corollary 9.\nThe conclusion of the following lemma that \u03c01 (G) is not commensurate to a\nsurface-by-free group was discovered and proved independently by Chris Odden in\nhis thesis, and by Lee Mosher. I will give a different proof which will generalize to\nmy later examples.\n\n\f19\nS\n\nq\n\np\n\n1\n0\nF\n\nFigure 5:\nDefine subgroups Li , Ri , Gi of \u03c01 (S), and subgroups Hi of \u03c01 (F ) by induction as\nfollows:\n\u2022 let H0 = \u03c01 (F ), G0 = \u03c01 (S),\n\u22121\n\u2022 let H1 = p\u2217 (G0 ) \u2229 q\u2217 (G0 ), L1 = p\u22121\n\u2217 (H1 ), R1 = q\u2217 (H1 ), G1 = L1 \u2229 R1 ,\n\u22121\n\u2022 let Hi+1 = p\u2217 (Gi ) \u2229 q\u2217 (Gi ), Li+1 = p\u22121\n\u2217 (Hi+1 ), Ri+1 = q\u2217 (Hi+1 ), Gi+1 =\nLi+1 \u2229 Ri+1 .\n\nFrom p\u2217 ([c]) = q\u2217 ([c2 ]) = [a2 ], we know [a2 ] \u2208 H1 but [a] \u2208\n/ H1 , [c] \u2208 L1 , [c2 ] \u2208 R1\nbut [c] \u2208\n/ R1 .\nTherefore L1 6= R1 , [c2 ] \u2208 G1 , [c] \u2208\n/ G1 .\n2\n4\nSimilarly, from p\u2217 ([c ]) = [a ], q\u2217 ([c2 ]) = [a2 ], we know p\u2217 (G1 ) 6= q\u2217 (G1 ), [c2 ] \u2208 L2 ,\n4\n[c ] \u2208 R2 , but [c2 ] \u2208\n/ R2 , [c4 ] \u2208 G2 .\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nInductively, we have [c2 ] \u2208 Gn , p\u2217 ([c2 ]) = [a4 ], q\u2217 ([c2 ]) = [a2 ],\nn\nn+1\nn\nso p\u2217 (Gn ) 6= q\u2217 (Gn ), [c2 ] \u2208 Ln+1 , [c2 ] \u2208\n/ Rn+1 , but [c2 ] \u2208 Rn+1 .\nHence we get two sequences {Li } and {Ri } of finite index normal subgroups of\n\u03c01 (S), the indexes of [\u03c01 (S) : Li ] and [\u03c01 (S) : Ri ] \u2192 \u221e as i \u2192 \u221e.\nLemma 11. Suppose the edge group \u03c01 (S) of \u03c01 (G) contains two nested sequences\nof finite index normal subgroups L1 > L2 > * * * and R1 > R2 > * * * which are\nconstructed inductively as follows:\n\u22121\n1. H1 = p\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)) \u2229 q\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)), L1 = p\u22121\n\u2217 (H1 ), R1 = q\u2217 (H1 ), G1 = L1 \u2229 R1\n\n2. Hi+1 = p\u2217 (Gi ) \u2229 q\u2217 (Gi )\n\u22121\n3. Li+1 = p\u22121\n\u2217 (Hi+1 ), Ri+1 = q\u2217 (Hi+1 ), Gi+1 = Li+1 \u2229 Ri+1\n\nIf Li 6= Ri for all i, then \u03c01 (G) is not commensurate to a surface-by-free group.\nProof. It is known that every edge or vertex stabilizer in the Bass-Serre tree t is\nisomorphic to some edge or vertex group of the graph of groups. Let e1 be an edge of\nthe Bass-Serre tree t such that the stabilizer stab(e1 ) = \u03c01 (S). Let g be the generator\nof the underlying graph \u0393 of the graph of spaces G; [SW79] says that if \u03c01 (S) is\nidentified with p\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)), then q\u2217 (\u03c01 (S)) = g \u22121 \u03c01 (S)g. There exists a unique edge\n\n\f20\ne2 \u2208 t, such that e2 = ge1 . It is easy to see that R1 = q\u2217\u22121 (p\u2217 (\u03c01 (S) \u2229 q\u2217 (\u03c01 (S))) =\nstab(e1 ) \u2229 stab(e2 ). Let ej = gej\u22121 for a positive integer j, let \u03b1i be the oriented path\ne1 \u2217 * * * \u2217 ei in the Bass-Serre tree t. \u2229\u01eb\u2208\u03b1i stab(\u01eb) = \u2229ij=1 stab(ej ) = Ri . Similarly,\nthere exists another sequence of oriented paths {\u03b2k } in t such that \u2229\u01eb\u2208\u03b2k stab(\u01eb) = Lk .\nTherefore [\u03c01 (S) : Li ] \u2192 \u221e and [\u03c01 (S) : Ri ] \u2192 \u221e imply [stab(e) : \u2229\u01eb\u2208E stab(\u01eb)] = \u221e.\nFor the case studied here, every edge stabilizer is a finite index subgroup of some vertex\nstabilizers, if the vertex is an end point of that edge. So [stab(e) : \u2229\u01eb\u2208E stab(\u01eb)] =\n\u221e implies [stab(v) : \u2229w\u2208V stab(w)] = \u221e. According to Lemma 10, \u03c01 (G) is not\ncommensurate to a surface-by-free group.\nIn order to construct a group which is not abstractly commensurate to a surfaceby-free group, our first strategy is to find a pseudo-Anosov mapping class \u03a6 which\nfixes all the finite index normal subgroups of \u03c01 (S). But unfortunately, the theorem\nbelow tells us that there does not exist such a pseudo-Anosov mapping class.\nTheorem 12. Let Sn be a closed surface with genus n, where n \u2265 2. For any\n\u03a6 \u2208 Aut(\u03c01 (Sn )), if \u03a6 fixes all the finite index normal subgroups of \u03c01 (Sn ), then\n\u03a6 \u2208 Inn(\u03c01 (Sn )).\nBefore proving this theorem, we introduce some related history and preliminaries\nfirst.\nIn [Lub80], Lubotzky proved that for any free group Fn , n \u2265 2, if \u03a8 \u2208 Aut(Fn )\nfixes all the finite index normal subgroups of Fn , then \u03a8 \u2208 Inn(Fn ). In particular,\nevery normal automorphism of Fn is inner. Bogopolski, Kudryavtseva and Zieschang\nin [BKZ04] proved that for any closed hyperbolic surface Sn with genus n not less than\n2, if \u03a6 \u2208 Aut(\u03c01 (Sn )) fixes all the normal subgroups of \u03c01 (Sn ), then \u03a6 \u2208 Inn(\u03c01 (Sn )).\nThe main theorem in that paper says for any non-separating simple closed curve \u03b1\non S, up to conjugate equivalent, \u03b1 is the only non-separating simple closed curve in\nits normal closure. The theorem in [BKZ04] says:\nTheorem 13. Let S be a closed orientable surface and g, h are non-trivial elements\nof \u03c01 (S) both containing simple closed two-sided curves \u03b3 and \u03ba, resp. The group\nelement h belongs to the normal closure of g if and only if h is conjugate to g \u01eb or\nto (gug \u22121u\u22121)\u01eb , \u01eb \u2208 {1, \u22121}; here u is a homotopy class containing a simple closed\ncurve \u03bc which properly intersects \u03b3 exactly once.\nI would like to thank Jason Deblois for help with Lemma 14.\nLemma 14. For any two non trivial, non freely homotopic, non-separating simple\nclosed curves a and b on S, let [a], [b] denote the homotopy class of them in \u03c01 (S).\nThere exists a finite index normal subgroup N \u2208 \u03c01 (S), such that [a] \u2208 N and [b] \u2208\n/ N.\nA group G is said to be residually finite, if for any element g \u2208 G, g 6= 1, there\nexists a finite group K and a homomorphism h : G \u2192 K, such that h(g) 6= 1.\nA Haken manifold is a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold which contains\na 2-sided incompressible surface.\n\n\f21\nProof. : Let M = S \u00d7 I, where I is the interval [0, 1]. \u03c01 (M) is isomorphic to \u03c01 (S).\nSince a is a simple closed curve on S, attach a 2-handle B to M along a\u00d7{0}\u222aa\u00d7{1}\nobtain a Haken manifold M \u2032 . This attachment gives a surjective homomorphism\n\u01eb : \u03c01 (M) \u2192 \u03c01 (M \u2032 ), and the kernel is the normal closure of [a]. Since a is the only\nnon-separating simple closed curve in the normal closure of [a], by applying Theorem\n13, it follows that [b] does not belong to the kernel of \u01eb.\nAccording to Theorem 1.1 in [Hem72], \u03c01 (M \u2032 ) is residually finite. So for [b] \u2208\n\u03c01 (M), there exist a finite group K and a homomorphism \u03b4 : \u03c01 (M \u2032 ) \u2192 K, such that\n[b] \u2208\n/ ker(\u03b4).\nLet N denote the kernel ker(\u03b4 \u25e6 \u01eb). Obviously, N is a finite index normal subgroup\nof \u03c01 (S), and [a] \u2208 N, but [b] \u2208\n/ N.\nProof of Theorem 12: Let \u03a6 be an element of Aut(\u03c01 (S)), and let \u03c6 be a representative of it in Homeo(S). According to [BKZ04], if \u03a6 \u2208\n/ Inn(\u03c01 (S)), then there exists\na non-separating simple closed curve a on S, such that a and \u03c6(a) are not freely\nhomotopic to each other. According to Lemma 14, there exist a finite index normal\nsubgroup N \u22b3\u03c01 (S), such that [a] \u2208 N and [\u03c6(a)] \u2208\n/ N. It follows that \u03a6(N) 6= N.\nIn the following, we shall construct a pseudo-Anosov mapping class which does\nnot fix all the finite index normal subgroups of \u03c01 (S), but fixes Li and Ri as in Lemma\n11.\nIn the following, let G\u03c6m be a graph of surfaces as in Figure 3, where F, S, p, q\nas described in Corollary 9.\nTheorem 15. There exists a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Homeo(S), so\nthat \u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is hyperbolic but is not commensurate to a surface-by-free group.\n\u03b1\u2032\nd\n\nc\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\nS\nFigure 6:\nProof. If there exists a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6, such that \u03c6\u2217 (Li ) = Li and\n\u03c6\u2217 (Ri ) = Ri , according to Lemma 11, then [stab(e) : \u2229stab\u01eb\u2208E (\u01eb)] = \u221e. Therefore\n\u03c01 (G\u03c6m ) is not commensurate to a surface-by-free group.\n\n\f22\n\na\np(\u03b2) \u223c q(\u03b2)\n\np(\u03b1) \u223c q(\u03b1)\n\nF\nFigure 7:\nCurves mentioned in this theorem are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, these two\nfigures are a refinement of Figure 4.\nFirst, we will describe the covering maps p and q with more details. Let p\u22121 (a2 ) =\nc, q \u22121 (a) = c \u222a d. It is easy to see that p(\u03b1) is homotopic to q(\u03b1) \u2282 F and p(\u03b2) is\nhomotopic to q(\u03b2) \u2282 F , where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2282 S as in Figure 6. Therefore [\u03b1], [\u03b2] \u2208 Li \u2229 Ri\nfor all i.\nSecond, we claim that if \u03b3 is a simple closed curve in S, such that [\u03b3] \u2282 Li for\nsome i, then (\u03c4\u03b3 )\u2217 of the Dehn-twist \u03c4\u03b3 fixes Li . Note that Li is a finite index normal\nsubgroup of \u03c01 (S) if and only if there exists a finite group K and a homomorphism\nf : \u03c01 (S) \u2192 K such that Li = ker(f ). We shall see that \u03c4\u03b3 maps every element in\nthe kernel of f to an element in the kernel of f , i.e., (\u03c4 )\u2217 fixes Li . Let [g] \u2208 \u03c01 (S)\nbe an element in Li . Decompose [g] = [h1 ] * * * [hn ], so that [hj ] \u2208 \u03c01 (S) is represented\nby a closed loop in S which has only one transverse intersection point with \u03b3, for\nall j \u2208 {1, * * * , n}. Depending on how hi intersects with \u03b3, [\u03c4\u03b3 (hi )] is one of the\nfollowing four kinds: [hi \u03b3], [\u03b3hi ], [\u03b3hi \u03b3 \u22121 ], [\u03b3 \u22121 hi \u03b3]. The trivial case is g \u2229 \u03b3 = \u2205, so\nf ([\u03c4\u03b3 (g)]) = [g]. Otherwise,\nf ([\u03c4\u03b3 (g)]) = f ([\u03c4\u03b3 (h1 )] * * * [\u03c4\u03b3 (hn )])\n= f ([\u03c4\u03b3 (h1 )]) * * * f (\u03c4\u03b3 (hn ))\n= f ([h1 ]) * * * f ([hn ]) = f ([h1 * * * hn ]) = f ([g]) = Ik\nwhere Ik is the identity of K. It shows that (\u03c4\u03b3 )\u2217 fixes Li .\n\nIf we can find disjointly essential curve systems C and D which satisfy the conditions in Theorem 3, and if all the homotopy classes of the elements of C and D belong\nto Li and Ri for all i, then we can construct a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6 as\ndescribed in Theorem 3, such that \u03c6\u2217 fixes Li and Ri for all i.\nIn the following, we will prove that there exist disjointly essential curve systems\nb such that C \u222a D fills S, where \u03b1, \u03b2 as in Figure 6. In\nC = \u03b1\u222a\u03b1\nb, and D = \u03b2 \u222a \u03b2,\nb \u2208 \u2229i (Li \u2229 Ri ).\naddition, [\u03b1], [b\n\u03b1], [\u03b2] and [\u03b2]\nIn order to find a simple closed curve \u03b1\nb satisfying the above conditions, first, we\nwill show that there exists a simple closed curve \u03b1\u2032 such that [\u03b1\u2032 ] \u2208 \u2229i (Li \u2229 Ri ). Since\nLi and Ri are finite index normal subgroups of \u03c01 (S) , and [\u03b1] \u2208 \u2229i (Li \u2229 Ri ), the\n\n\f23\nnormal closure N\u03b1 of [\u03b1] is a subgroup of \u2229i (Li \u2229 Ri ). Recall that the normal closure\nN\u03b1 of [\u03b1] is the smallest normal subgroup of \u03c01 (S) contains [\u03b1]. Applying Theorem\n13, we only need the easy direction of this theorem, the separating curve \u03b1\u2032 as in\nFigure 6 represents an element in N\u03b1 .\nSecond, we shall construct a simple closed curve \u03b1\nb on S from the simple closed\n\u2032\ncurve \u03b1 .\nFrom [Mos03], we know there exists a short exact sequence:\n1 \u2192 hT\u03b1 i \u2192 stab(\u03b1) \u2192 MCG(S \u2212 \u03b1) \u2192 1\nwhere hT\u03b1 i is a cyclic subgroup of MCG(S) generated by the mapping class T\u03b1 of\nthe Dehn-twist \u03c4\u03b1 around \u03b1, stab(\u03b1) is a subgroup of MCG(S) which fixes \u03b1, S \u2212 \u03b1\nis a surface by cutting S along \u03b1. The homomorphism \u03b9 : stab(\u03b1) \u2192 MCG(S \u2212 \u03b1) is\ndefined as \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6|S\u2212\u03b1 , for \u03a6 \u2208 stab(\u03b1).\nChoose a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c8 \u2208 Homoeo(S \u2212 \u03b1), maybe need pass\nto a high enough power of \u03c8, such that \u03b1\nb = \u03c8(\u03b1\u2032 ) is very close to the stable geodesic\nlamination \u039bS\u03c8 of \u03c8, therefore \u03b1\nb \u222a \u03b2 fills S \u2212 \u03b1. Also \u03b1\nb is disjoint with \u03b1 because \u03b1\u2032\nis disjoint with \u03b1.\nUsing the same method, we can find a simple closed curve \u03b2b which is disjoint with\n\u03b2 and \u03b2b \u222a \u03b1 fills S \u2212 \u03b2.\nb it is easy to see that C \u222a D fills S. According to\nLet C = {\u03b1, \u03b1\nb}, D = {\u03b2, \u03b2},\nTheorem 3, if \u03c60 is a homeomorphism of S, such that \u03c4\u03b1+ , \u03c4\u03b1b+ , \u03c4\u03b2\u2212 and \u03c4\u03b2b\u2212 appear at\nleast once in \u03c60 , then \u03c60 is a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. Since [\u03b1],[\nb \u2208 \u2229i (Li \u2229 Ri ), (\u03c60 )\u2217 fixes Li and Ri for all i.\nwidehat\u03b1], [\u03b2], [\u03b2]\nIn order to finish the proof of this theorem, according to Corollary 9, we only\nneed to show that there exists some pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism \u03c6 constructed\nas above, so that the virtual centralizer V Ch\u03a6i of h\u03a6i has trivial intersection with\nthe mapping classes of the deck transformation groups of the covering maps p and\nq respectively, where \u03a6 \u2208 MCG(S) is the mapping class of \u03c6. Abusing of notation,\ndenote both the deck transformations and the mapping classes of the deck transformations by Dp and Dq . The deck transformation group of p has only two elements\nDp and the identity.\nLet \u03c60 be a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of S constructed above, and let \u03a60 be\nits mapping class. Let \u039bs\u03c60 and \u039bu\u03c60 be the stable and unstable geodesic laminations\nof \u03c60 respectively. It is known that \u03a60 fixes Li and Ri for all i.\nSuppose the deck transformation group of p has nontrivial intersection with the\nvirtual centralizer of h\u03a60 i, i.e., Dp (\u039bs\u03c60 ) = \u039bs\u03c60 . We claim that Dp (T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 )) 6= T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ),\nwhere T\u03b1 is the mapping class of the Dehn-twist \u03c4\u03b1 . Notice that T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) is the stable\ngeodesic lamination of the pseudo-Anosov mapping class T\u03b1 \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22121 , and T\u03b1 \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22121 fixes\nLi and Ri for all i. If the claim is true, let \u03a61 = T\u03b1 \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22121 , then V Ch\u03a61 i has trivial\nintersection with Dp .\nWe shall prove the claim. Notice that there exists a simple closed curve \u03b3 on\nS is disjoint with \u03b1, such that Dp (\u03b1) = \u03b3. According to Lemma 4.1.C in [Iva02],\nDp T\u03b1 Dp\u22121 = TDp (\u03b1) = T\u03b3 .\n\n\f24\nSuppose Dp T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) = T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ), then:\nDp T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) = Dp T\u03b1 \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22121 (T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ))\n= T\u03b3 Dp \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22121 (T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ))\n= T\u03b3 Dp \u03a60 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) = T\u03b3 (\u039bs\u03c60 )\nTherefore T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) = T\u03b3 (\u039bs\u03c60 ).\n\nIt follows that T\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b3 \u2208 V Ch\u03a60 i, but from Theorem 3.5 in [Mos], we know that\nV Ch\u03a60 i has h\u03a60 i as a finite index subgroup. Hence up to some power m, (T\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b3 )m \u2208\nh\u03a60 i, but obviously (T\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b3 )m is neither pseudo-Anosov nor the identity, so it is not\nan element of h\u03a60 i. Therefore Dp T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) 6= T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ).\nIf in addition Dq T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) 6= T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ), then take \u03a6 = \u03a61 , this theorem is proved.\nIf Dq T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ), then we claim Dq T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) 6= T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ). If the claim is not\ntrue, then\nDq T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 )\n= T\u03b1 (Dq T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ))\n= Dq T\u03b8 (T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 )),\n\nwhere \u03b8 = Dq (\u03b1) is a simple closed curve on S disjoint from \u03b1. Therefore\nT\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b8\u22121 Dq\u22121 Dq T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = \u039bu\u03c60\nIt follows that T\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b8\u22121 T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = \u039bu\u03c60 . Since \u03b8, \u03b1 are disjoint simple closed curves,\nT\u03b1 T\u03b8\u22121 = T\u03b8\u22121 T\u03b1 . Hence T\u03b1\u22121 T\u03b8\u22121 T\u03b12 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = T\u03b8\u22121 T\u03b1 (\u039bu\u03c60 ) = \u039bu\u03c60 . By the same reason\nin the above argument, it is impossible.\nReplacing T\u03b1 , T\u03b3 by T\u03b12 , T\u03b32 in the above proof of Dp T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) 6= T\u03b1 (\u039bs\u03c60 ), we can\nsee Dp T\u03b12 (\u039bs\u03c60 ) 6= T\u03b12 (\u039bs\u03c60 ). Take \u03a6 = T\u03b12 \u03a60 T\u03b1\u22122 , then this theorem is proved.\n\n\f25\n\nReferences\n[BC88]\n\nS. Bleiler and A.
