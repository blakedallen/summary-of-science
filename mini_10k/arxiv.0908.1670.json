Given\na positive integer n and a R\u2212algebra A one can consider three functors of\npoints from the category CR of commutative R\u2212algebras to the small category\nof sets. All these functors are representable, namely\n\u2022 RepnA represents the functor induced by B \u2192 homR (A, Mn (B)), where\nMn (B) are the n \u00d7 n matrices over B, for all B \u2208 CR .\n\u2022 the non-commutative Hilbert scheme HilbnA represents the functor induced by\nB \u2192 { left ideals I \u2282 A\u2297k B : A\u2297k B/I is a projective R\u2212module of rank n}\nfor all B \u2208 CR .\n\u2022 Spec \u0393nR (A)ab represents the functor induced by\nB \u2192 { multiplicative polynomial laws homogeneous of degree n from A to B }\nfor all B \u2208 CR .\n\n1\n\n\fWhen A is commutative HilbA\nn is the usual Hilbert scheme of n\u2212points\nof X = Spec A. A polynomial law is a kind of map generalizing polynomial\nmapping and coinciding with it over flat R\u2212modules. The typical example\nof multiplicative polynomial law homogeneous of degree n is the determinant\nof n \u00d7 n matrices. The R\u2212algebra \u0393nR (A)ab is the quotient of the R\u2212algebra\n\u0393nR (A) of the divided powers of degree n on A by the ideal generated by commutators . When A is flat as R\u2212module this coincides with the symmetric\ntensors of order n that is \u0393nR (A) \u223c\n= (A\u2297n )Sn , where Sn is the symmetric group.\nTherefore when A is commutative and flat we have Spec \u0393nR (A)ab \u223c\n= X (n) , the\nn\u2212th symmetric product of X = Spec A.\nWe discuss the connections between the coarse moduli space RepnA //GLn\nof the n\u2212dimensional representations of A, with HilbnA and the affine scheme\nSpec \u0393nR (A)ab . We build a norm map from HilbnA to \u0393nR (A)ab which specializes to the Hilbert-Chow morphism on the geometric points when A is\ncommutative and k is an algebraically closed field. This generalizes the construction done by Grothendieck, Deligne and others. When k is an infinite\nfield and A = k{x1 , . . . , xm } is the free k\u2212associative algebra on m letters, we\nuse the isomorphism Spec \u0393nk (A)ab \u223c\n= RepnA //GLn following from Theorem 1\nin [35] to give a simple description of this norm map.\nA field of application of our construction can be the extension to the positive characteristic case of some of the results due to L. Le Bruyn on noncommutative desingularization which can be found in [16]. Another intriguing\npossibility is to use our construction to extend the work done by C.H.Liu\nand S.T.Yau on D-Branes in [17] to the more recent non commutative case\nin [18].\nThis survey paper is based on [9, 33, 34, 35, 36].\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the organizers for their invitation.

If f : B \u2192 C\nis a ring homomorphism we denote with Mn (f ) : Mn (B) \u2192 Mn (C) the\nhomomorphism induced on matrices.\nDefinition 2.1. By an n-dimensional representation of A over B we mean\na homomorphism of R\u2212algebras \u03c1 : A \u2192 Mn (B).\nThe assignment B \u2192 NR (A, Mn (B)) defines a covariant functor NR \u2192\nSets. This functor is represented by a commutative R\u2212algebra. We report\nhere the proof of this fact to show how this algebra comes up using generic\nmatrices. These objects will be also crucial in the construction of the norm\nmap in Section 4.\nLemma 2.1. [4, Lemma 1.2.] For all A \u2208 NR there exist a commutative\nR\u2212algebra Vn (A) and a representation \u03c0A : A \u2192 Mn (Vn (A)) such that \u03c1 7\u2192\nMn (\u03c1) * \u03c0A gives an isomorphism\n\u223c\n=\n\nCR (Vn (A), B) \u2212\n\u2192 NR (A, Mn (B))\n\n(1)\n\nfor all B \u2208 CR .\nProof. Let A be an arbitrary R\u2212algebra and suppose that there exist \u03c0A and\nVn (A) as in the statement. Let I \u2282 A be a bilateral ideal of A. Let J be\nthe ideal generated by \u03c0A (I) in Mn (Vn (A)). There exists then an ideal K \u2282\n3\n\n\fVn (A) such that J = Mn (K). It should be clear that Vn (A/I) = Vn (A)/K\nand that \u03c0A/I : A/I \u2192 Mn (Vn (A/I)) is given by\n\u03c0A\n\nA\n\u000f\n\nA/I\n\n\u03c0A/I\n\n/\n\n/\n\nMn (Vn (A))\n\u000f\n\nMn (Vn (A/I)) = Mn (Vn (A))/J\n\nIt is enough now to prove the statement for A = R{x1 , . . . , xm } = R \u2297k\nF the free associative R\u2212algebra on m letters. Let Vn (A) = R[\u03bekij ] be\nthe polynomial ring in variables {\u03bekij : i, j = 1, . . . , n, k = 1, . . . , m} over\nthe base ring R. To every n\u2212dimensional representation of A over B it\ncorresponds a unique m\u2212tuple of n \u00d7 n matrices, namely the images of\nx1 , . . . , xm , hence a unique \u03c1\u0304 \u2208 CR (R[\u03bekij ], B) such that \u03c1\u0304(\u03bekij ) = (\u03c1(xk ))ij .\nFollowing C.Procesi [23, 4] we introduce the generic matrices. Let \u03bek = (\u03bekij )\nbe the n \u00d7 n matrix whose (i, j) entry is \u03bekij for i, j = 1, . . . , n and k =\n1, . . . , m. We call \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bem the generic n \u00d7 n matrices. Consider the map\n\u03c0A : A \u2192 Mn (Vn (R)),\n\nxk 7\u2212\u2192 \u03bek ,\n\nk = 1, . . . , m .\n\nIt is then clear that the map CR (Vn (A), B) \u220b \u03c3 7\u2192 Mn (\u03c3)*\u03c0A \u2208 NR (A, Mn (B))\ngives the isomorphism (1) in this case.\nRemark 2.1. It should be clear that the number of generators m of A is immaterial and we can extend the above isomorphism to an arbitrary R\u2212algebra.\nDefinition 2.2. We write RepnA to denote Spec Vn (A). It is considered as\nan R\u2212scheme.\nThe map\n\u03c0A : A \u2192 Mn (Vn (A)), xk 7\u2212\u2192 \u03bek .\n(2)\nis called the universal n-dimensional representation.\nGiven a representation \u03c1 : A \u2192 Mn (B) we denote by \u03c1\u0304 its classifying map\n\u03c1\u0304 : Vn (A) \u2192 B .\nExample 2.1. For the free algebra one has RepnA \u223c\n= Mnm the scheme whose\nB\u2212points are the m\u2212tuples of n \u00d7 n matrices with entries in B.\nExample 2.2. Note that RepnA could be quite complicated, as an example,\nwhen A = C[x, y] we obtain that RepnA is the commuting scheme i.e. the\ncouples of commuting matrices and it is not even known (but conjecturally\ntrue) if it is reduced or not, see [34].\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nGLn \u2212action\n\nDefinition 2.3. We denote by GLn the affine group scheme whose group of\nB\u2212points form the group GLn (B) of n \u00d7 n invertible matrices with entries\nin B, for all B \u2208 CR .\nDefine a GLn -action on RepnA as follows. For any \u03c6 \u2208 RepnA (B), g \u2208\nGLn (B), let \u03c6g : Vn (A) \u2192 B be the R\u2212algebra homomorphism corresponding to the representation given by\nA \u2192\nMn (B)\na 7\u2212\u2192 g(Mn (\u03c6) * \u03c0A (a))g \u22121 .\n\n(3)\n\nNote that if \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 are B\u2212points of RepnA , then the A\u2212module structures\ninduced on B n by \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2032 are isomorphic if and only if there exists g \u2208\nGLn (B) such that \u03c6\u2032 = \u03c6g .\nDefinition 2.4. We denote by RepnA //GLn = Spec Vn (A)GLn (R) the categorical quotient (in the category of R\u2212schemes) of RepnA by GLn . It is the\n(coarse) moduli space of n\u2212dimensional linear representations of A.\n2.2.1\n\nDeterminant\n\nDefinition 2.5. We denote by Cn (A) the k\u2212subalgebra of Vn (A) generated\nby the coefficients ei (\u03c0A (f )) of characteristic polynomials\ndet(t \u2212 \u03c0A (f )) = tn +\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u22121)i ei (\u03c0A (f ))tn\u2212i\n\ni=1\n\nas f varies in A.\nRemark 2.2. Let B \u2208 CR and let b \u2208 Mn (B) and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that ei (b)\nis the trace of \u2227i (b). Obviously e1 (b) is the trace of b and en (b) = det(b) is\nthe determinant of b.\nRemark 2.3. We have just seen that the general linear group GLn (R) acts on\nVn (A). It is clear that Cn (A) \u2282 Vn (A)GLn (R) for all k, R \u2208 Ck and A \u2208 Nk .\nIt has been shown in [6, 25, 39] that Cn (F ) = Vn (F )GLn (k) when k is Z\nor an infinite field. When k is a characteristic zero field it follows that\nCn (A) = Vn (A)GLn (k) for all A \u2208 Nk because GLn (k) is linear reductive in\nthis case.\n5\n\n\f3\n\nSymmetric products and divided powers\n\nIn this part of the paper we introduce a representable functor whose representing scheme will play the same role played by the symmetric product in\nthe classical Hilbert-Chow morphism.\n\n3.1\n\nPolynomial laws\n\nWe first recall the definition of polynomial laws between k-modules. These\nare mappings that generalize the usual polynomial mappings between free\nk-modules. We mostly follow [27, 28, 36, 38] and we refer the interested\nreader to these papers for detailed descriptions and proof.\nDefinition 3.1. Let M and N be two k-modules. A polynomial law \u03c6 from\nM to N is a family of mappings \u03c6A : A \u2297k M \u2192 A \u2297k N, with A \u2208 Ck such\nthat the following diagram commutes\nA \u2297k M\n\n\u03c6A\n\n/\n\nA \u2297k N\n\nf \u2297idM\n\n(4)\n\nf \u2297idN\n\n\u000f\n\nB \u2297k M\n\n\u03c6B\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nB \u2297k N\n\nfor all A, B \u2208 Ck and all f \u2208 Ck (A, B).\nDefinition 3.2. Let n \u2208 N. If \u03c6A (au) = an \u03c6A (u), for all a \u2208 A, u \u2208 A \u2297k M\nand all A \u2208 Ck , then \u03c6 is called homogeneous of degree n.\nDefinition 3.3. If M and N are two k-algebras and\n(\n\u03c6A (xy)\n= \u03c6A (x)\u03c6A (y)\n\u03c6A (1A\u2297M ) = 1A\u2297N\nfor A \u2208 Ck and for all x, y \u2208 A \u2297k M, then \u03c6 is called multiplicative.\nWe need the following\nDefinition 3.4. For S a set and any additive monoid M, we denote by M (S)\nthe set of functions f : S \u2192 M with finite support. P\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 M (S) , we denote by | \u03b1 | the (finite) sum s\u2208S \u03b1(s),\n6\n\n\fLet A and B be two k\u2212modules and \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a polynomial law.\nThe following result on polynomial laws is a restatement of Th\u00e9or\u00e8me I.1 of\n[27].\nTheorem 3.1. Let S be a set.\n1. Let L = k[xs ]s\u2208S and let as be elements of A such that as is 0 except for\na finite number of s \u2208 S, then there exist \u03c6\u03be ((as )) \u2208 B, with \u03be \u2208 N(S) ,\nsuch that:\nX\nX\n\u03c6L (\nxs \u2297 as ) =\nx\u03be \u2297 \u03c6\u03be ((as ))\n(5)\nwhere x\u03be =\n\nQ\n\ns\u2208S\n\ns\u2208S\n\n\u03be\u2208N(S)\n\nx\u03bess .\n\n2. Let R be any commutative k\u2212algebra and let rs \u2208 R for s \u2208 S, then:\nX\nX\n\u03c6R (\nrs \u2297 as ) =\nr \u03be \u2297 \u03c6\u03be ((as ))\n(6)\ns\u2208S\n\nwhere r \u03be =\n\nQ\n\ns\u2208S\n\n\u03be\u2208N(S)\n\nrs\u03bes .\n\n3. If \u03c6 is homogeneous of degree n, then one has \u03c6\u03be ((as )) = 0 if |\u03be| is\ndifferent from n. That is:\nX\nX\n\u03c6R (\nrs \u2297 as ) =\nr \u03be \u2297 \u03c6\u03be ((as ))\n(7)\ns\u2208S\n\n\u03be\u2208N(S) , |\u03be|=n\n\nIn particular, if \u03c6 is homogeneous of degree 0 or 1, then it is constant\nor linear, respectively.\nRemark 3.1. The above theorem means that a polynomial law \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is\ncompletely determined by its coefficients \u03c6\u03be ((as )), where {as : s \u2208 S} is a\nset of linear generator of A and \u03be \u2208 N(S) .\nRemark 3.2. If A is a free k\u2212module and {at : t \u2208 T } is a basis of A, then \u03c6\n(T )\nis completely determined by its coefficients \u03c6\u03be ((at )), with \u03be \u2208 N\nP . If also B\nis a free k\u2212module\nwith basis {bu : u \u2208 U}, then \u03c6\u03be ((at )) = u\u2208U \u03bbu (\u03be)bu .\nP\nLet a =\n\u03bc\na\nt\u2208T t t \u2208 A. Since only a finite number of \u03bct and \u03bbu (\u03be) are\ndifferent from zero, the following makes sense:\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u03c6(a) = \u03c6(\n\u03bct at ) =\n\u03bc\u03be \u03c6\u03be ((at )) =\n\u03bc\u03be (\n\u03bbu (\u03be)bu )\nt\u2208T\n\n\u03be\u2208N(T )\n\n\u03be\u2208N(T )\n\nu\u2208U\n\nX X\n=\n(\n\u03bbu (\u03be)\u03bc\u03be )bu .\nu\u2208U \u03be\u2208N(T )\n\n7\n\n\fHence, if both A and B are free k\u2212modules, a polynomial law \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is\nsimply a polynomial map.\nDefinition 3.5. Let k be a commutative ring.\n(1) For M, N two k\u2212modules we set Pnk (M, N) for the set of homogeneous\npolynomial laws M \u2192 N of degree n.\n(2) If M, N are two k\u2212algebras we set MPnk (M, N) for the multiplicative\nhomogeneous polynomial laws M \u2192 N of degree n.\nThe assignment N \u2192 Pnk (M, N) (resp. N \u2192 MPnk (M, N)) determines a\nfunctor from Modk (resp. Nk ) to Sets.\nExample 3.1.\n1. For all A, B \u2208 Nk it holds that MP1k (A, B) = Nk (A, B).\nA linear multiplicative polynomial law is a k\u2212algebra homomorphism.\n2. For B \u2208 Ck the usual determinant det : Mn (B) \u2192 B belongs to\nMPnk (Mn (B), B)\n3. For B \u2208 Ck the mapping b 7\u2192 bn belongs to MPnk (B, B)\n4. For B, C \u2208 CB consider p \u2208 MPnB (B, C), since p(b) = p(b 1) = bn p(1) =\nbn 1C it is clear that in this case raising to the power n is the unique\nmultiplicative polynomial law homogeneous of degree n.\n5. When A \u2208 Nk is an Azumaya algebra of rank n2 over its center k, then\nits reduced norm N belongs to MPnk (A, k).\n\n3.2\n\nDivided powers\n\nThe functors just introduced in Def. 3.5 are represented by the divided\npowers which we introduce right now.\nDefinition 3.6. For a k-module M the divided powers algebra \u0393k (M) (see\n[27, 28]) is an associative and commutative k-algebra with identity 1k and\nproduct \u00d7, with generators m(k) , with m \u2208 M, k \u2208 Z and relations, for all\nm, n \u2208 M:\n1. m(i) = 0, \u2200i < 0;\n2. m(0) = 1k , \u2200m \u2208 M;\n8\n\n\f3. (\u03b1m)(i) = \u03b1i m(i) , \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 k, \u2200i \u2208 N;\nP\n4. (m + n)(k) = i+j=k m(i) \u00d7 n(j) , \u2200k \u2208 N;\n\u0001 (i+j)\n5. m(i) \u00d7 m(j) = i+j\nm\n, \u2200i, j \u2208 N.\ni\n\n(\u03b1 )\n\nThe k-module \u0393k (M) is generated by finite products \u00d7i\u2208I xi i of the\nabove generators. The divided powers algebra \u0393k (M) is an N-graded algebra\nwith homogeneous components \u0393nk (M), (n \u2208 N), the submodule generated\nP\n(\u03b1 )\nby {\u00d7i\u2208I xi i : | \u03b1 |= i \u03b1i = n}. One easily checks that \u0393k is a functor\nfrom Modk to Ck .\nRemark 3.3. Suppose n! is invertible in k e.g. k \u2283 Q. The map given by\nx(n) 7\u2192 xn /n! induces an isomorphism of k\u2212algebras between \u0393k (M) and the\nsymmetric algebra over M. Whence the name divided powers.\n\n3.3\n3.3.1\n\nUniversal properties\nFunctoriality and adjointness\n\n\u0393nk is a covariant functor from Modk to Modk and one can easily check that\nit preserves surjections. The map \u03b3 n : r 7\u2192 r (n) is a polynomial law M \u2192\n\u0393nk (M) homogeneous of degree n. We call it the universal map for the following reason: consider another k\u2212module N and the set Modk (\u0393nk (M), N) of\nhomomorphisms of k\u2212modules between \u0393nk (M) and N, we have an isomorphism\n\u223c\n=\n\u2192 Pnk (M, N)\n(8)\nModk (\u0393nk (M), N) \u2212\ngiven by \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3 n .\n3.3.2\n\nThe algebra \u0393nk (A)\n\nIf A is k\u2212algebra then \u0393nk (A) inherits a structure of k\u2212algebra by\na(n) \u22c6 b(n) = (ab)(n)\n\n(9)\n\nThe unit in \u0393nk (A) is 1(n) . It was proved by N.Roby [28] that in this way A \u2192\n\u0393nk (A) gives a functor from k\u2212algebras to k\u2212algebras such that \u03b3 n (a)\u03b3 n (b) =\n\u03b3 n (ab), \u2200a, b \u2208 A. Hence\n\u223c\n=\n\nNk (\u0393nk (A), B) \u2212\n\u2192 MPnk (A, B)\nand the map given by \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3 n is an isomorphism for all A, B \u2208 Nk .\n9\n\n(10)\n\n\f3.3.3\n\nBase change\n\n[27, Thm.

Let M be a k\u2212module and consider the n\u2212fold tensor power\nM \u2297n . The symmetric group Sn acts on M \u2297n by permuting the factors and\nwe denote by TSnk (M) or simply by TSn (M) the k\u2212submodule of M \u2297n of\nthe invariants for this action. The elements of TSn (M) are called symmetric\ntensors of degree n over M.\nRemark 3.4. If M is a k\u2212algebra then Sn acts on M \u2297n as a group of\nk\u2212algebra automorphisms. Hence TSn (M) is a k\u2212subalgebra of M \u2297n .\n3.4.1\n\nFlatness and Symmetric Tensors\n\nSuppose M \u2208 Nk (resp. M \u2208 Ck ). The homogeneous polynomial law M \u2192\nTSnk (M) given by x 7\u2192 x\u2297n gives a morphism \u03c4n : \u0393nk (M) \u2192 TSnk (M) which\nis an isomorphism when M is flat over k. Indeed one can easily prove that\n\u03c4n is an isomorphism in case M is free. The flat case then follows because\nany flat k\u2212module is a filtered direct limit of free modules and both \u0393n and\nT S n commute with filtered direct limits.\nRemark 3.5. Divided powers and symmetric tensors are not always isomorphic. See [19] for counterexamples.\n\n3.5\n\nGenerators\n\nFollowing [35] we give here a generating set for \u0393nk (A).\nWe need a Lemma.\n\n10\n\n\fLemma 3.2. Suppose M \u2208 Modk is generated by {mi }i\u2208I then \u0393nk (M) is\nP\n(\u03b1 )\ngenerated by {\u00d7i\u2208I mi i : | \u03b1 |= i \u03b1i = n} for all n \u2208 N. In particular if\nP\n(\u03b1 )\n{mi }i\u2208I is a basis of M then {\u00d7i\u2208I mi i : | \u03b1 |= i \u03b1i = n} is a basis of\n\u0393nk (M) for all n \u2208 N.\nProof. The first assertion follows directly from the definition.\nSuppose M is free of finite rank p. By Remark 3.2 it follows that any\npolynomial law M \u2192 k homogeneous of degree\nn can be identified with\nP\nh\nan homogeneous polynomial in p variables h1 +***+hp =n ah1 ,...,hp xh1 1 * * * xp p \u2208\nk[x1 , . . . , xp ]. This means that one can find a linear form taking arbitrary\n(\u03b1 )\n(\u03b1 )\nvalues on the m1 1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 mp p . This argument easily extends to not\nfinitely generated free k\u2212modules by applying it to arbitrary finite subsets\nof a basis.\nDefinition 3.8. Let M denote the set of monomials in F . There is a natural\ndegree d on F given by d(xi ) = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , m and d(1) = 0 . We\ndenote by M+ the set of monomials of positive degree. Thus M = M+ \u222a{1} .\nWe set F + for the ideal of F generated by M+ .\nIt is clear that M is a basis of F so that Mn = {\u00d7\u03bc\u2208M\u03bc(\u03b1\u03bc ) : | \u03b1 |= n}\nis a basis of \u0393nk (M) for all n \u2208 N by Lemma 3.2.\nProposition 3.3 (Product Formula).

It follows from Corollary 3.5 and Lemma 3.6.\n14\n\n\f3.6\n\nThe abelianization\n\nIn this paragraph we introduce the abelianization functor and we prove some\nof its properties. Then we deduce the fact that the abelianization of divided\npowers commutes with base change.\nDefinition 3.10. Given a k\u2212algebra A we denote by [A] the two-sided ideal\nof A generated by the commutators [a, b] = ab \u2212 ba with a, b \u2208 A. We write\nAab = A/[A]\nand call it the abelianization of A.\nWe denote by abA the surjective homomorphism abA : A \u2192 Aab .\nFor A, B \u2208 Nk and f \u2208 Nk (A, B) we denote by f ab \u2208 Ck (Aab , B ab ) the\nabelianization of f .\nWe collect some facts regarding this construction.\nProposition 3.8.\n1. For all B \u2208 Ck there is an isomorphism Ck (Aab , B) \u2192\nNk (A, B) by means of \u03c1 7\u2192 \u03c1 * abA . Equivalently for all \u03c6 \u2208 Nk (A, B)\nthere is a unique \u03c6 : Aab \u2192 B such that the following diagram commutes\nabA\n\n/ Aab\nBB\nB\n\u03c6\n\u03c6 BBB\n! \u000f\n\nA BB\n\nB\n\n2. The assignment A \u2192 Aab induces a covariant functor Nk \u2192 Ck that\npreserves surjections.\nProof. The first point is obvious. For A, B \u2208 Nk and f \u2208 Nk (A, B) we have\nthat f ([A]) \u2282 [B]. This proves the functoriality. Let A, B \u2208 Nk and suppose\nf \u2208 Nk (A, B) to be surjective. We have that [B] = f ([A]).\nDefinition 3.11. We call the just introduced functor the abelianization functor .\nProposition 3.9. For all A \u2208 Nk and all R \u2208 Ck it holds that\n(R \u2297k A)ab \u223c\n= R \u2297k Aab\n\n15\n\n\fProof. The homomorphism idR \u2297 abA : R \u2297k A \u2192 R \u2297k Aab of R\u2212algebras\ninduces a unique one \u03b1 : (R\u2297k A)ab \u2192 R\u2297k Aab making the following diagram\ncommutative\nidR \u2297abA\n/ R \u2297 Aab\nR \u2297k AM\nkO\nMMM\nMMM\nM\nabR\u2297A MMM&\n\n\u03b1\n\n(R \u2297k A)ab\n\nOn the other hand the homomorphism of k\u2212algebras given by the composition\nabR\u2297A\nA \u2192 R \u2297k A \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 (R \u2297k A)ab\ninduces a unique one \u03b2 : Aab \u2192 (R \u2297k A)ab . This \u03b2 extends to a homomorphism of R\u2212algebras \u03b2\u0303 : R \u2297k Aab \u2192 (R \u2297k A)ab that is the inverse of \u03b1 as\ncan be easily checked.\nCorollary 3.10. With the notation of Proposition 3.9 we have\n\u0393nR (R \u2297k A)ab \u223c\n= R \u2297k \u0393nk (A)ab\nProof. It follows from (12) and Proposition 3.9.\nRemark 3.9. Corollary 3.10 remain true by replacing \u0393n with TSn when A is\nflat. In particular when R is a field.\nDefinition 3.12. We denote by SAn the affine R\u2212scheme Spec \u0393nR (A)ab .\nProposition 3.11. Suppose A = R \u2297 F/J \u2208 Nr then the induced morphism\nn\n\u223c\nSAn \u2192 SR\u2297F\n= SFn \u00d7k Spec R is a closed immersion.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 3.8 and 3.3.3.\nRemark 3.10. In view of Definition 3.12 all the results of this section can be\nrephrased in terms of R\u2212schemes. In particular Corollary 3.10 means that\nSAn base-changes well.\nRemark 3.11. When A is flat (see paragraph 3.4.1) and commutative one\nsees that\nSAn \u223c\n= X n /Sn = Spec TSnR (A)\nthe n\u2212fold symmetric product of X =Spec A.\nIn particular it follows that SFn \u223c\n= Spec TSnk (F )ab .\n16\n\n\f3.7\n\nGenerators II\n\nWe extend here the results of Section 3.5 to the abelianization \u0393(A)ab .\nDefinition 3.13. Consider M+ / \u223c the set of the equivalence classes of\nmonomials \u03bc \u2208 M+ where \u03bc \u223c \u03bc\u2032 if and only if there is a cyclic permutation\n\u03c3 such that \u03c3(\u03bc) = \u03bc\u2032 . We set \u03a8 to denote the set of equivalence classes in\nM+ / \u223c made of primitive monomials\nTheorem 3.12. The ring \u0393nk (F )ab is generated as a ring by ab(1(n\u2212i) \u00d7 \u03bc(i) )\nwhere 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and \u03bc varying in a complete set of representatives of \u03a8.\nProof. Using (15) it easy to see that\nab(1(n\u2212i) \u00d7 (rs)(i) ) = ab(1(n\u2212i) \u00d7 (sr)(i) )\n\n(21)\n\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and r, s \u2208 F + . The result then follows from Theorem 3.7\nand the surjectivity of ab.\nCorollary 3.13. Let A be a k\u2212algebra generated by {ai }i\u2208I then\n1. \u0393nk (A) is generated by 1(n\u2212j) \u03bc(j) where 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and \u03bc varies in the\nset of primitive monomials in {ai }i\u2208I\n2. (\u0393nk (A))ab is generated by ab(1(n\u2212j)\u03c5 (j) ) where \u03c5 varies in a complete\nset of representative of equivalence classes (under cyclic permutations)\nof primitive monomials in the {ai }i\u2208I .\nProof. Given the k\u2212algebra A and a set {ai }i\u2208I of its generators we have a\nsurjective homomorphism FI = k{xi }i\u2208I \u2192 A hence another surjective one\n\u0393nk (FI ) \u2192 \u0393nk (A) and the result follows from Theorem 3.7. The result on the\nabelianization follows from Theorem 3.12 since the abelianization functor\npreserves surjections.\nRemark 3.12. Corollary 3.13(1) is a refinement of Cor.(4.5) in [38].\nCorollary 3.14. The following hold\n1. The ring TSnk (k[x1 , . . . , xm ]) \u223c\n= k[x11 , x12 , . . . , xm1 , . . . , xmn ]Sn of the\nmultisymmetric functions also known as the ring of the vector invariants of the symmetric group is generated by the 1(n\u2212i) \u00d7 \u03c5 (i) with \u03c5 =\nx\u03b11 1 * * * x\u03b1mm such that \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m are coprime.\n17\n\n\fn\n2. Let A be a commutative k\u2212algebra\nby {ai }P\ni\u2208I then \u0393k (A) is\nQ generated\n\u03b1i\n(n\u2212j) (j)\ngenerated by 1\n\u03c5 where \u03c5 = i ai is such that i \u03b1i is finite and\nthe \u03b1i are coprime.\n\nProof. It follows from Theorem 3.12 since \u0393n preserves surjections. Write\nP = K[x1 , . . . , xm ], then P is a free k\u2212module hence the surjection F \u2192 P\ninduces another surjection T Skn (F )ab \u2192 T Skn (P ). Use Theorem 3.12.\nRemark 3.13. This gives another proof of Th.1 in [32]\nRemark 3.14. A minimal generating set for \u0393nk (k[x1 , . . . , xm ]) has been found\nby David Rydh [29] improving Corollary 3.14.\n\n4\n\nThe norm map\n\nIn this section we introduce a morphism which connect RepnA //GLn and SAn .\nLet \u03c1 \u2208 NR (A, B) be a representation of A over B \u2208 CR . The composition det *\u03c1 is a multiplicative polynomial law homogeneous of degree n\nbelonging to MPRn (A, B). We denote by det\u03c1 the unique homomorphism in\nCR (\u0393nR (A)ab , B) such that det *\u03c1 = det\u03c1 *\u03b3 n , see (10). The correspondence\n\u03c1 7\u2192 det\u03c1 is clearly functorial in B giving then a morphism \u0393nR (A)ab \u2192 Vn (A)\nby universality and henceforth a morphism of R\u2212schemes\ndet : RepnA \u2192 SAn\n\n(22)\n\nLet \u03c1\u0304 : Vn (A) \u2192 B be the unique B\u2212point of RepnA such that \u03c1 = Mn (\u03c1\u0304)*\u03c0A ,\nsee Definition 2.2. It is easy to check that\n\u03c1\u0304 * det *\u03c0A = det *Mn (\u03c1\u0304) * \u03c0A = det *\u03c1\nso that the following commutes\nA\n\n\u03c0A\n\n/\n\nMn (Vn (A))\n\ndet\n\n/\n\nVn (A)\n\u03c1\u0304\n\nMn (\u03c1\u0304)\n\nA\n\n\u03c1\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nMn (B)\n\n(23)\n\ndet\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nB\n\nIt follows that det is the affine morphism corresponding to the composition\nof the universal map \u03c0A introduced in (2.2) with the determinant i.e. to the\ntop horizontal arrows of diagram (23).\n18\n\n\fThe determinant is invariant under basis changes and RepnA //GLn is a\ncategorical quotient. Hence there exists a unique morphism det : RepnA //GLn \u2192\nSAn such that the following commutes\nRepnA K\n\n(24)\n\nKKK\nKdet\nKKK\nKKK\n\u000f\n% n\nn\n/S\nRep //GLn\nA\n\ndet\n\nA\n\nWe have the following result.\nTheorem 4.1. The morphism det : RepnA //GLn \u2192 SAn has the following\nproperties.\n1. If A = k{x1 , . . . , xm } then det is an isomorphism when k = R is an\ninfinite field or k = R = Z.\n2. Suppose k = R is an infinite field. If A \u2208 Ck then det induces an\nisomorphism between the associated reduced schemes.\n3. Suppose k = R is a characteristic zero field then\nwhen A \u2208 Nk then det is a closed embedding,\nwhen A \u2208 Ck then det is an isomorphism.\n4. When A is commutative and flat as R\u2212module then \u0393R (A) \u223c\n= TSnR (A) \u2192\nVn (A) is an injective homomorphism.\nProof. First of all observe that det gives 1(n\u2212i) \u00d7 a(i) 7\u2192 ei (\u03c0A (a)) for all\ni = 1, . . . , n and a \u2208 A. Therefore by Corollary 3.13 we have that det is a\nsurjection \u0393k (A) \u2192 Cn (A) \u2282 Vn (A)GLn (R) by Remark 2.3.\n1. When A is the free k\u2212algebra \u0393k (A)ab \u223c\n= Cn (A) = Vn (A)GLn (k) by\nTheorem 1.1 in [35]. This is obtained by showing that \u0393k (A)ab and Cn (A) =\nVn (A)GLn (k) shares a common presentation by generators and relations.\n2. and 4. When A is commutative and flat as k\u2212module the above\nmapping has an inverse Cn (A) \u2192 TSnk (A) \u223c\n= \u0393nk (A) given by the restriction\nto Cn (A) of the unique homomorphism Vn (A) \u2192 A\u2297n that corresponds to\nthe linear representation A \u2192 Mn (A\u2297n ) defined by mapping a \u2208 A to the\ndiagonal matrix whose diagonal is (a \u2297 1\u2297n\u22121 , 1 \u2297 a \u2297 1n\u22122 , . . . , 1\u2297n\u22121 \u2297 a).\nThis gives \u0393nk (A) \u223c\n= Cn (A). In this way it is obvious that det corresponds\n19\n\n\fto the restriction to diagonal matrices. It is also clear that this gives a\nsurjection Vn (A)GLn (k) \u2192 \u0393nk (A). When k = R is an infinite field we have\nan isomorphism of the associated reduce schemes. Indeed the surjection\nVn (A)GLn (k) \u2192 \u0393nk (A) induced by the restriction to diagonal matrices is also\ninjective because any orbit has in its closure a tuple of diagonal matrices, i.e.\na semisimple representation.\n3.The fact that det is a closed embedding in characteristic zero follows\nconsidering the following diagram\nRepnF //GL\nn\nO\nRepnA //GLn\n\ndet\n\n/\n\n\u223c\n=\ndet\n\n/\n\nSnFO\nSAn\n\nrecalling Proposition 3.11 and the fact that GLn in this case is linear reductive. This fact together with the isomorphism of reduced structures give the\nisomorphism for A \u2208 Ck when k is a characteristic zero field.\n\n5\n\nThe non commutative Hilbert scheme\n\nFor A \u2208 NR we recall the definition and the main properties of a representable\nfunctor of points whose representing scheme is the usual Hilbert scheme of\npoints when A is commutative. For references see for example [2, 9, 22, 26,\n30, 31, 37].\nDefinition 5.1. For any algebra B \u2208 CR we write\nHilbnA (B) := {left ideals I in A \u2297R B such that M = A \u2297R B/I is projective\nof rank n as a B-module}.\nProposition 5.1. The correspondence CR \u2192 Sets induced by B 7\u2192 HilbnA (B)\ngives a covariant functor denoted by HilbnA .\nProof. Straightforward verification.\nProposition 5.2. [37, Proposition 2] The contravariant functor R\u2212Schemes \u2192\nSets induced by HilbnA is representable by an R\u2212scheme denoted by HilbnA .\nProof. The functor HilbnA is a closed subfunctor of the grassmanian functor.\n\n20\n\n\fLet now B be a commutative k\u2212algebra. Consider triples (\u03c1, m, M) where\nM is a projective B\u2212module of rank n, \u03c1 : A \u2192 EndB (M) is a k\u2212algebra\nhomomorphism such that \u03c1(R) \u2282 B and \u03c1(A)(Bm) = M.\nDefinition 5.2. The triples (\u03c1, m, M) and (\u03c1\u2032 , m\u2032 , M \u2032 ) are equivalent if there\nexists a B\u2212module isomorphism \u03b1 : M \u2192 M \u2032 such that \u03b1(m) = m\u2032 and\n\u03b1\u03c1(a)\u03b1\u22121 = \u03c1\u2032 (a), for all a \u2208 A.\nThese equivalence classes represent B\u2212points of HilbnA as stated in the\nfollowing\nLemma 5.3. If B is a k\u2212algebra, the B\u2212points of HilbnA are in one-one\ncorrespondence with equivalence classes of triples (\u03c1, m, M).\nProof. Let I \u2208 HilbnA (B). Choose M = A \u2297R B/I and \u03c1 : A \u2192 EndB (M)\ngiven by the composition of the left regular action of A on itself and the\nB\u2212module homomorphism A \u2297R B \u2192 M. Finally let m = 1M .\nOn the other hand, let (\u03c1, m, M) be as in the statement, we consider the\nmap\nA \u2297R B \u2192 M,\na \u2297 b 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c1(a)(bm).\n(25)\nThis map is surjective and its kernel I is a B\u2212point in HilbnA . If we consider\na triple (\u03c1\u2032 , m\u2032 , M \u2032 ) in the same equivalence class of (\u03c1, m, M), we have that\nX\nX\nX\n\u03c1\u2032 (a)(b\u03b1(m)) =\n\u03b1\u03c1(a)(b\u03b1\u22121 \u03b1(m)) = \u03b1\n\u03c1(a)(bm)\n\nso that I \u2032 = I and the two triples define the same B\u2212point in HilbnA . (See\nalso [30, Lemma 0.1], and [37, Lemma 3]).\n\nRemark 5.1. If the triple (\u03c1, m, M) represents a B\u2212point of HilbnA , then the\nhomomorphism \u03c1 induces an R\u2212algebra structure on B. Moreover a homomorphism \u03c1\u2032 where (\u03c1\u2032 , m\u2032 , M \u2032 ) is in the same equivalence class of (\u03c1, m, M),\ninduces the same R\u2212algebra structure on B.\n\n5.1\n5.1.1\n\nExamples\nFree algebras\n\nAny A \u2208 NR is a quotient of an opportune free R-algebra R{x\u03b1 } and in\nthis case it is easy to see that the scheme HilbnA is a closed subscheme of\nHilbnR{x\u03b1 } .\n21\n\n\f5.1.2\n\nVan den Bergh's results\n\nIn [37] HilbnA was also defined by M. Van den Bergh in the framework of\nBrauer-Severi schemes. He proved that the scheme HilbnF is irreducible and\nsmooth of dimension n + (m \u2212 1)n2 if k is an algebraically closed field (see\n[37, Theorem 6]).\n5.1.3\n\nCommutative case: Hilbert schemes of n-points.\n\nLet now R = k be an algebraically closed field and let A be commutative. Let X = Spec A, the k\u2212points of HilbnA parameterize zero-dimensional\nsubschemes Y \u2282 X of length n. It is the simplest case of Hilbert scheme\nparameterizing closed subschemes of X with fixed Hilbert polynomial P, in\nthis case P is the constant polynomial n. The scheme HilbnA is usually called\nthe Hilbert scheme of n\u2212points on X (see for example [3, 14]).\n\n5.2\n\nA principal bundle over the Hilbert scheme\n\nFor any B \u2208 CR identify B n with AnR (B), the B\u2212points of the n\u2212dimensional\naffine scheme over R. We introduce another functor that is one of the cornerstones of our construction.\nDefinition 5.3. For each B \u2208 CR , let UnA (B) denote the set of B\u2212points\n(\u03c1\u0304, v) of RepnA \u00d7R AnR such that \u03c1(A)(Bv) = B n , i.e. such that v generates\nB n as A\u2212module via \u03c1 : A \u2192 Mn (B).\nRemark 5.2. It is easy to check that the assignment B 7\u2192 UnA (B) is functorial\nin B. Therefore we get a subfunctor UnA of RepnA \u00d7R AnR that is clearly open\nand we denote by UnA the open subscheme of RepnA \u00d7R AnR which represents\nit.\nWe can define an action of GLn on RepnA \u00d7R AnR similar to the one on\nRepnA , namely for any B \u2208 CR let\ng(\u03b1, v) = (\u03b1g , gv), g \u2208 GLn (B), \u03b1 \u2208 RepnA (B), v \u2208 AnR (B).\n\n(26)\n\nIt it is clear that UnA is stable under the above action. Therefore we have\nthat UnA is an open GLn \u2212subscheme of RepnA \u00d7R AnR .\nProposition 5.4. For the action described above, UnA \u2192 UnA /GLn is a\nlocally-trivial principal GLn \u2212bundle which is a universal categorical quotient.\n22\n\n\fProof. In [22, Proposition 1] the proposition is proved for the case A = F\nand k = R = Z. It has been extended in [2, Theorem 7.16] for arbitrary\nR. The statement then follows by observing that RepnA \u00d7R AnR is a closed\nGLn \u2212subscheme of RepnF \u00d7R AnR .\nWe have the following result.\nTheorem 5.5. The scheme UnA /GLn represents HilbnA and UnA \u2192 HilbnA is\na universal categorical quotient and a GLn \u2212principal bundle.\nProof. In [22, Proposition 1] the proposition is proved for the case A = F\nand k = R = Z. It has been extended in [2, Theorem 7.16] for arbitrary\nR. The statement then follows by observing that RepnA \u00d7R AnR is a closed\nGLn \u2212subscheme of RepnF \u00d7R AnR .\nRemark 5.3. Madhav Nori gave a direct proof of the representability of HilbnA\nfor k = R = Z and A = F in [22]. In this case Lemma 5.3 says that B\u2212points\nin HilbnF are represented by equivalence classes of triples (\u03c1, v, k n ) where\n\u03c1 : F \u2192 Mn (k)\nis an n\u2212dimensional representation of the algebra F over k and v \u2208 k n is such\nthat \u03c1(F )v = k n . It is then easy to see that UnA \u2192 UnA /GLn is a principal\nGLn \u2212bundle and that the above equivalence classes are in bijection with\nthe GLn \u2212orbits of UnA (see the proof of Lemma 5.3). The isomorphism\nUnA /GLn \u223c\n= HilbnA is then obtained by proving that HilbnA is Proj P where\nP = \u2295d Pd with\nPd = {f : f (g(a1, . . . , am , v)) = (det g)d f ((a1 , . . . , am , v)), for all g \u2208 GLn (k)}.\nExample 5.1. Let A = C[x, y] then HilbnA (C) is described by the above Theorem as\n{(X, Y, v) : X, Y \u2208 Mn (C), XY = Y X, C[X, Y ]v = Cn }.\nThis description of the Hilbert scheme of n\u2212points of C2 is one of the key\ningredients of the celebrated Haiman's proof of the n!

The image of the non commutative Hilbert-Chow morphism\nis isomorphic to the one of the forgetful map in the following cases\n1. when A is the free algebra and k = R = Z or it is an infinite field.\n2. when A is commutative and k = R is a characteristic zero field.\nProof. In the listed cases we have that det is an isomorphism hence we have\nan isomorphism between the image of hc with the one of the forgetful map.\nExample 6.1. Suppose A = F the free algebra. In this case RepnA //GLn =\nMnm (k)//GLn the coarse moduli space of m\u2212tuples of n \u00d7 n matrices modulo\nthe action of GLn by simultaneous conjugation. The scheme HilbnA is in this\ncase identified with the quotient by the above action of the open of RepnA \u00d7R\nAnR of the tuples (a1 , . . . , am , v) such that v is cyclic i.e. {f (a1 , . . . , am )v :\nf \u2208 A} linearly generates k n . In this case the Hilbert-Chow morphism can\nbe identified with the map induced by (a1 , . . . , am , v) 7\u2192 (a1 , . . . , am ).\nThis picture works for A = k[x1 , . . . , xm ] adding the extra condition that\nai aj = aj ai for all i, j.\n\nReferences\n[1] Artin, M.: On Azumaya algebras and finite-dimensional representations\nof rings .
