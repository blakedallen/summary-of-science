INTRODUCTION\nCoin \u001dipping (CF) is a\n\nryptographi\n\nproblem in whi h a pair of remote distrustful parties, usually referred to as\n\nAli e and Bob, must generate a random bit that they agree on. There are two types of\n\noin \u001dipping proto ols. In\n\nweak CF one of the parties prefers one of the out omes and the other prefers the opposite, whereas in strong CF ea h\n(i)\n(i)\nparty does not know the other's preferen e. The se urity of a CF proto ol is quanti\u001ced by the biases \u01ebA and \u01ebB\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(i)\n(i)\n(i = 0, 1); if PA\nand PB\nare the maximal probabilities that a dishonest Ali e or Bob an for e the out ome i,\nthen\n\n(i) \u2217\n\n(i)\n\n\u02c6 Pj\n\u01ebj =\n\nThe biases tell us to what extent ea h of the parties\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n,\n2\n\ni \u2208 {0, 1} .\n\n(1)\n\nan in rease beyond one half their\n\nhan es of obtaining ea h of\n\nthe out omes. In weak CF we asso iate ea h of the out omes with a win of one party over the other. Hen e, we are\nnot interested in bounding the maximal losing probability and we onsequently onsider only two biases: \u01ebi =P\n\u02c6 i\u2217 \u2212 1/2,\n(1) \u0001\n(0)\n(1)\n(0)\n\u2217\n\u02c6 max (\u01ebA , \u01ebB ), or \u01eb=\n\u02c6 max \u01ebA , \u01ebA , \u01ebB , \u01ebB in the\nwhere Pi is dishonest party i's maximal winning probability. \u01eb=\nase of strong CF, is often referred to as the bias of the proto ol.\nThe problem of CF was \u001crst introdu ed by Blum in 1981, who analyzed it in\nsubsequently shown that if there are no limitations on the parties'\nfor e any out ome they desire [2\u2104.\n\nlassi al settings [1\u2104.\n\nomputational power a dishonest party\n\nIt was\n\nan always\n\nWith the publi ation of the quantum key distribution proto ol of Bennett and\n\nBrassard in 1984 [3\u2104, it was realized that many\n\nommuni ation tasks that are impossible in a\n\nlassi al setting may\n\nbe possible in a quantum setting. In 1999 Goldenberg et al. introdu ed a quantum gambling proto ol [4\u2104, whi h is a\nproblem\n\nlosely related to weak CF (see [5\u2104). The \u001crst quantum (strong)\n\nby Aharonov et al.\n\nin 2000 [6\u2104.\n\noin \u001dipping proto ol per se was presented\n\u221a\n2/4 \u2243 0.354 [7\u2104.

As regards weak CF, in 2002 Spekkens and Rudolph introdu ed a family\nmust satisfy PA\n\nof three rounds of\n\nommuni ation proto ols in whi h both dishonest parties have a bias of\n\nMo hon then improved upon Spekkens and Rudolph's result by\nnumber of rounds [12, 13\u2104.

Similalry, also in the weak\n\nase, optimal proto ols exist for every degree of imbalan e [15\u2104, thereby generalizing\n\nMo hon's aforementioned result.\nSomewhat surprisingly, CF has yet to be generalized to many out omes.\nproblem is nontrivial, as a dishonest party\n\nan no longer for e with\n\nIndeed, even in\n\nshall fo us on two problems.

In the se ond, whi h we term\n\n1\n\nand\n\nN\n\nwithout any party being aware\n\nof any other's preferen e.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In se tion II we prove that, using quantum resour es, weak\nwith arbitrarily small bias is possible for any value of\nwhere, under\n\nertain\n\nN.\n\nThis result stands in marked\n\nN -sided\n\nontrast to the\n\ndi e rolling\n\nlassi al\n\nase,\n\nonditions, an honest party always loses. Furthermore, to gain insight as to what biases are\n\na hievable with a minimal number of rounds of\n\nommuni ation, we present a six-round weak three-sided DR proto ol,\n\nwhi h in orporates a three-round weak imbalan ed CF proto ol that generalizes the results of Spekkens and Rudolph\nto the imbalan ed\n\nase. In se tion III we generalize Kitaev's bound to any number of parties,\n\nM,\n\nand out omes,\n\nN,\n\nand present a family of two-party proto ols that saturate it for any value of N . We then make use of this family\nm\nto extend this result to 2m-party n -sided DR any for value of m and n. In the pro ess, we generalize Chailloux\nand Kerenidis' optimal strong CF proto ol to\ntwo-party strong\n\nN -sided\n\nover the imbalan ed\n\nDR proto ols for any value of\n\nase. Finally, we analyze a family of three-round\n\nN.\n\nII. WEAK DICE ROLLING WITH ARBITRARILY SMALL BIAS\nThe purpose of weak CF is to de ide between two parties.

Similar expressions obtain for the probabilities of all other out omes. Hen e, we have shown that the\nthis\n\nonstru tion saturates the generalization of Kitaev's bound, eq. (18), for\n\nM =2\n\nand any\n\nN.\n\nC. A family of optimal multi-party strong di e rolling proto ols\nThe above\n\nonstru tion readily allows for the introdu tion of a family of\n\n2m-party\n\nstrong\n\nnm -sided\n\nDR proto ols\n\nsaturating the generalization of Kitaev's bound, eq. (18). The idea is to sequentially have distin t pairs of parties\nstrongly roll a di e to eliminate some of the out omes, until a single out ome is obtained. Thus, in the\n\nase of four\n\nparties and nine out omes, in the \u001crst stage the \u001crst and se ond parties strongly roll a three-sided di e. If its out ome\n\n4 to 9 are eliminated, while if its out ome is 2, out omes 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 are eliminated, et . Suppose,\n1 to 6 are eliminated. Then in the se ond stage parties three and four strongly roll a\nthree-sided di e, where if its out ome is 1, then the \u001cnal out ome of the proto ol is 7, while if its out ome is 2, then\nm\nthe \u001cnal out ome is 8, et . In general, for 2m-parties and an n -sided di e, the proto ol onsists of n stages. In ea h\nstage a di\u001berent pair of parties strongly rolls an n-sided di e. As there are a total of 2m parties, ea h party strongly\nparti ipates in a di e roll on e. In order to for e the out ome they desire, the 2m \u2212 1 dishonest parties must bias the\nis\n\n1, out\n\nomes\n\nfor example, that out omes\n\nresult of the di e roll in whi h the honest party parti ipates, and sin e at any stage there is only a single out ome\n\nthat\n\nan lead to the desired out ome, the dishonest parties an maximally bias the out ome with a probability of\n1/2\n+ \u01ed, whi h saturates the generalization of Kitaev's bound, eq. (18).\n\n(1/n)\n\nIt is not straightforward to generalize this s heme to any number of parties and out omes. The problem is that we\nhave introdu ed an ordering, whi h dependent on it, may in general render the proto ol asymmetri\n\nin the biases, or\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 1: Two-party strong \u001cve-sided DR proto ol saturating Kitaev's bound.

The fra tions beside ea h bran h give the probability for\n\nonditional on the out omes in the box above. Thus, for the leftmost bran h we have that\n\nthe probability for the out ome equals\n\n1/2 * 2/3 * 3/5 = 1/5,\n\net .\n\neven trivial by allowing the dishonest parties to for e the out ome that they desire. This\nof optimal weak DR to de ide the ordering. Unfortunately, this\n\nan be \u001cxed by making use\n\nomes at the expense of optimality, i.e. eq. (18) is\n\nno longer saturated. Nevertheless, proto ols in orporating optimal weak and strong DR proto ols may give rise to\nbiases remarkably\nDR proto ol.\n\nlose to the inherent bounds. As an example,\n\nonsider the following three-party strong three-sided\n\nIn the \u001crst round Ali e, Bob and Clare weakly roll a three-sided di e.\n\na \u2208 {1, 3} and informs the two losers of his/her hoi e.

That is, a di\u001beren e of 0.027 %. Similarly, to the optimal 2m-party nm -sided DR\nn\nproto ols des ribed above, this proto ol an be generalized to a family of 3n-party 3 -sided DR proto ol, with ea h\n\neq. (19)\n\ngiving rise to the same bias.\nTo\n\nomplete the dis ussion we should mention that strong DR is nontrivial also in\n\nlassi al settings. Indeed, the\n\nN -sided DR are onstrained by the following set of inequalities [10\u2104\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011 N \u22122\n1\n(i) \u2217\n(j) \u2217\n+ \u03b4i, j ,\ni, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N } .\n1 \u2212 P\u0304A\n1 \u2212 P\u0304B\n\u2264\nN\nN\n\nlassi al biases for two-party\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that these inequalities are \u0010weaker\u0011 than the\n\n(37)\n\norresponding Kitaev bound, and hen e\n\nallow for higher biases.\n\nD. A family of three-round two-party strong di e rolling proto ols\nIn this subse tion we introdu e a family of three-round strong DR proto ols,\n\nwhi h generalizes Colbe k's\n\nentanglement-based strong CF proto ol [18\u2104 to any number of out omes. Suppose Ali e and Bob want to strongly\nroll an\n\nN -sided\n\ndi e using a minimal number of rounds of\n\nommuni ation. Then they may pro eed as follows. Ali e\nPN\n|\u03c8N i = \u221a1N i=1 |ii \u2297 |ii, and sends the se ond half of\nea h system to Bob. Bob randomly sele ts one of the systems to serve as the di e and informs Ali e of his sele tion.\nprepares a pair of systems in the state\n\n|\u03c8N i \u2297 |\u03c8N i,\n\nwhere\n\nAli e and Bob then measure their half of the sele ted system in the S hmidt basis. The out ome of this measurement\nis the out ome of the di e roll. Finally, Ali e sends Bob her half of system that was not sele ted, and he veri\u001ces it\nwas indeed prepared in the state\n\n|\u03c8N i.\n\nFollowing a similar argument to Colbe k's, Ali e's and Bob's maximal probabilities of biasing to any of the out omes\nare given by\n\n(i) \u2217\n\nPA\n\n=\n\nN +1\n,\n2N\n\n(i) \u2217\n\nPB\n\n=\n\n2N \u2212 1\n,\nN2\n\n{i = 1, . . . , N }\n\n(38)\n\n\f9\n\n(i)\n(i) \u2217\n(i)\n(i) \u2217\nThus, for N = 3 \u01ebA = PA\n\u2212 1/3 = 1/3 and \u01ebB = PB \u2212 1/3 = 2/9. Interestingly, in the limit where N \u2192 \u221e,\n(i) \u2217\n(i) \u2217\n(i) \u2217\n(i) \u2217\nPA \u2192 1/2 , PB \u2192 2/N , so that PA * PB \u2192 1/N . Hen e, in this limit Kitaev's bound is nontrivially saturated\nin a \u001cnite number of rounds, albeit at a ost of a high asymmetry of the biases.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have de\u001cned a novel mutli-out ome generalization of quantum CF, whi h we have termed quantum DR. We\nhave analyzed both its weak and strong variants.

In addition, we also made use of this last result to introdu e a family of optimal\n2m-party strong nm -sided DR proto ols for any value of m and n. The question of whether this is also possible in\nthe general\n\nase of any number of parties and out omes remains open for now.\n\nA knowledgments\nWe thank Lev Vaidman and Oded Regev for useful\n\nomments.
