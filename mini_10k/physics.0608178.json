The two models generally agreed in simulations of\nrealistic swell propagation in the Southern California Bight.\nHowever, both models assume a gently sloping bottom, and\ntheir limitations in regions with steep topography are not\nwell understood. Booij [1983], showed that the MSE is\nvalid for bottom slopes as large as 1/3 for normal wave incidence. To extend its application to steeper slopes, Massel [1993 ; see also Chamberlain and Porter, 1995] modified\nthe MSE by including terms of second order in the bottom\nslope, that were neglected by Berkhoff [1972]. This modified\nmild slope equation (MMSE) includes terms proportional to\nthe bottom curvature and the square of the bottom slope.\nChandrasekera and Cheung [1997] observed that the curvature terms significantly change the wave height behind a\nshoal, whereas the slope-squared terms have a weaker influence. Lee and Yoon [2004] noted that the higher order\nbottom slope terms change the wavelength, which in turn\naffects the refraction. In spite of these improvements, an\nimportant restriction of these equations is that the vertical\nstructure of the wave field is described by the Airy solution of waves over a horizontal bottom. Hence the MMSE\ncannot describe the wave field accurately over steep bottom topography. Thus, Massel [1993] introduced an additional infinite series of local modes ('evanescent modes' or\n'decaying waves'), that allows a local adaptation of the wave\nfield [see also Porter and Staziker, 1995], and converges to\nthe exact solution of Laplace's equation, except at the bottom interface. Indeed, the vertical velocity at the bottom\nis still zero, and is discontinuous in the limit of an infinite\nnumber of modes. Recently, Athanassoulis and Belibassakis\n[1999] added a 'sloping bottom mode' to the local mode series expansion, which properly satisfies the Neuman bottom\nboundary condition. This approach was further explored by\nChandrasekera and Cheung, [2001] and Kim and Bai, [2004].\nAlthough the sloping-bottom mode yields only small corrections for the wave height, it significantly improves the accuracy of the velocity field close to the bottom. Moreover, this\n\n1. Introduction\nWaves are strongly influenced by the bathymetry when\nthey reach shallow water areas. Munk and Traylor [1947]\nconducted a first quantitative study of the effects of bottom\ntopography on wave energy transformation over Scripps and\nLa Jolla Canyons, near San Diego, California. Wave refraction diagrams were constructed using a manual method, and\ncompared to visual observations. Fairly good agreement was\nfound between predicted and observed wave heights. Other\neffects such as diffraction were found to be important elsewhere, for sharp bathymetric features (e.g. harbour structures or coral reefs), prompting Berkhoff [1972] to introduce an equation that represents both refraction and diffraction. Berkhoff's equation is based on a vertical integration\nof Laplace's equation and is valid in the limit of small bottom slopes. It is widely known as the mild slope equation\n(MSE). A parabolic approximation of this equation was proposed by Radder [1979], and further refined by Kirby [1986]\nand Dalrymple and Kirby [1988].\n\n1 Centre Militaire d'Oc\u00e9anographie, Service\nHydrographique et Oc\u00e9anographique de la Marine, 29609\nBrest, France.\n2 Department of Naval Architecture and Marine\nEngineering, National Technical University of Athens, PO\nBox 64033 Zografos, 15710 Athens, Greece.\n3 Department of Oceanography, Naval Postgraduate\nSchool, Monterey, CA 93943, USA.\n4 Integrative Oceanography Division, Scripps Institution of\nOceanography, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.\n5 Laboratoire de Sondages Electromagn\u00e9tique de\nl'Environnement Terrestre, Universit\u00e9 de Toulon et du Var,\nLa Garde, France.\n\nCopyright 2018 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227/18/$9.00\n\n1\n\n\fX-2\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\nmode enables a faster convergence of the series of evanescent\nmodes, by making the convergence mathematically uniform.\nAs these steep topography models are becoming available,\none may wonder if this level of sophistication is necessary to\naccurately describe the transformation of ocean waves over\nnatural continental shelf topography. It is expected that if\nsuch models are to be useful anywhere, it should be around\nsteep submarine canyons. Surprisingly, a geometrical optics\nrefraction model that assumes weak amplitude gradients on\nthe scale of the wavelength, usually corresponding to gentle\nbottom slopes, was found to yield accurate predictions of\nswell transformation over Scripps canyon [Peak, 2004]. The\npractical limitations of mild slope approximations for natural seafloor topography are clearly not well established.\nThe goal of the present paper is to understand the propagation of waves over a submarine canyon, including the\npractical imitations of geometrical optics theory for the associated large bottom slopes. Numerical models will be\nused to sort out the relative importance of refraction, and\ndiffraction effects. Observations of ocean swell transformation over Scripps and La Jolla Canyons, collected during\nthe Nearshore Canyon Experiment (NCEX), are compared\nwith predictions of the three-dimensional (3D) coupledmode model. This model is called NTUA5 because its\npresent implementation will be limited to a total of 5 modes\n[Belibassakis et al., 2001]. This is the first verification of\na NTUA-type model with field observations, as previous\nmodel validations were done with laboratory data. This application of NTUA5 to submarine canyons is not straightforward since the model is based on the extension of the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) model of Athanassoulis and Belibassakis [1999], and requires special care in the position of the\noffshore boundary and the numerical damping of scattered\nwaves along the boundary. Further details on these and software developments, and a comparison with results of the\nSWAN model [Booij et al., 1999] for the same NCEX case\nare given by Gerosthathis et al. [2005].\nHere, model results are compared with two earlier models which assume a gently sloping bottom. These are the\nparabolic refraction/diffraction model REF/DIF1 (V2.5)\n[Kirby, 1986], applied in a spectral sense, and a spectral\nrefraction model based on backward ray tracing [Dobson,\n1967 ; O'Reilly and Guza, 1993]. A brief description of the\ncoupled-mode model and the problems posed by its implementation in the NCEX area is given in section 2. Although\nour objective is the understanding of complex 3D bottom\ntopography effects in the NCEX observations, this requires\nsome prior analysis, performed in section 3, of reflection and\nrefraction patterns over idealized 2D canyons. Results are\npresented for realistic transverse canyon profiles, including a\ncomparison with the 2D analysis of infragravity wave observations reported by Thomson et al. [2005]. Comparisons of\n3D models with field data are presented in section 4 for representative swell events observed during NCEX. Conclusions\nfollow in section 5.\n\n2. Numerical Models\nThe fully elliptic 3D model developed by Belibassakis et\nal. [2001] is based on the 2D model of Athanassoulis and\nBelibassakis [1999]. These authors formulate the problem\nas a transmission problem in a finite subdomain of variable\ndepth h2 (x) (uniform in the lateral y-direction), closed by\nthe appropriate matching conditions at the offshore and inshore boundaries. The offshore and inshore areas are considered as incidence and transmission regions respectively, with\nuniform but different depths (h1 , h3 ), where complex wave\npotential amplitudes \u03c61 and \u03c63 are represented by complete\nnormal-mode series containing the propagating and evanescent modes.\nThe wave potential \u03c62 associated with h2 (region 2), is\ngiven by the following local mode series expansion:\n\u03c62 (x, z) = \u03c6\u22121 (x)Z\u22121 (z; x) + \u03c60 (x)Z0 (z; x)\n\n+\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c6n (x)Zn (z; x),\n\n(1)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere \u03c60 (x)Z0 (z; x) is the propagating mode and\n\u03c6n (x)Zn (z; x) are the evanescent modes. The additional\nterm \u03c6\u22121 (x)Z\u22121 (z; x) is the sloping-bottom mode, which\npermits the consistent satisfaction of the bottom boundary\ncondition on a sloping bottom. The modes allow for the local adaptation of the wave potential. The functions Zn (z; x)\nwhich represent the vertical structure of the nth mode are\ngiven by,\ncosh[k0 (x)(z + h(x))]\n,\ncosh(k0 (x)h(x))\n\n(2)\n\ncos[kn (x)(z + h(x))]\n, n = 1, 2, ...,\ncos(kn (x)h(x))\n\n(3)\n\nZ0 (z, x) =\n\nZn (z, x) =\n\nZ\u22121 (z, x) = h(x)\n\n\"\u0012\n\nz\nh(x)\n\n\u00133\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\nz\nh(x)\n\n\u00132 #\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere k0 and kn are the wavenumbers obtained from the\ndispersion relation (for propagating and evanescent modes),\nevaluated for the local depth h = h(x):\n\u03c9 2 = gk0 tanh k0 h = \u2212gkn tan kn h,\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03c9 the angular frequency\nAs discussed in Athanassoulis and Belibassakis [1999], alternative formulations of Z\u22121 exist, and the extra slopingbottom mode controls only the rate of convergence of the\nexpansion (1) to a solution that is indeed unique. The modal\namplitudes \u03c6n are obtained by a variational principle, equivalent to the combination of Laplace's equation, the bottom\nand surface boundary conditions, and the matching conditions at the side boundaries, leading to the coupled-mode\nsystem,\n\u221e\nX\n\namn (x)\u03c6\u2032\u2032n (x) + bmn (x)\u03c6\u2032n (x) + cmn (x)\u03c6n (x) = 0,\n\nn=\u22121\n\nfor\n\n(m = \u22121, 0, 1, ...)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere amn , bmn and cmn are defined in terms of the Zn\nfunctions, and the appropriate end-conditions for the mode\namplitudes \u03c6n ; for further details, see see Athanassoulis\nand Belibassakis [1999]. The sloping-bottom mode ensures\nabsolute and uniform convergence of the modal series. The\nrate of decay for the modal function amplitude is proportional to (n\u22124 ). Here, the number of evanescent modes is\ntruncated at n = 3, which ensures satisfactory convergence,\neven for bottom slopes exceeding 1.\nThis 2D solution is further extended to realistic 3D bottom topographies by Belibassakis et al. [2001]. In 3D, the\ndepth h2 is decomposed into a background parallel-contour\nsurface hi (x) and a scattering topography hd (x, y). The\n3D solution is then obtained as the linear superposition of\nappropriate harmonic functions corresponding to these two\ntopographies. There is no limitation on the shape and amplitude of the bottom represented by hd (x, y) except that\nhd > 0, which can always be enforced by a proper choice of\nhi , for further details see Belibassakis et al. [1999]. The wave\npotential solution over the 2D topography (hi ) is governed\nby the equations described previously. The wave potential\nassociated with the scatterers (hd ) is obtained as the solution of a 3D scattering problem. The decomposition of the\n\n\fX-3\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\ntopography in hd and hi is not uniquely defined by the constraints that hi is invariant along y and hd > 0, and there is\nthus no simple physical interpretation of the scattered field\nwhich corresponds to both reflection and refraction effects.\nThe main benefit of this decomposition is that the scattered\nwave field propagates out of the model domain along the\nentire boundary, which greatly simplifies the specification of\nthe horizontal boundary conditions.\nIn practice we chose\nhi (x) = min {h(x, y)\n\nfor\n\ny \u2208 [ymin , ymax ]} .\n\n(7)\n\n3.

Oblique incidence will not be considered for\nthis canyon because the results are similar to those obtained\nfor Scripps Canyon (discussed below).\n\nFurther, the bathymetry hi + hd is modified by including\na transition region for y < ymin and y > ymax in which hd\ngoes to zero at the model boundary, so that no scattering\nsources are on the boundary and waves actually propagate\nout of the domain. This modification of the bathymetry does\nnot change the propagation of the incoming waves, provided\nthat the offshore boundary is in uniform water depth, as in\nthe cases described by Belibassakis et al. [2001], or in deep\nenough water so that a uniform water depth can be prescribed without having an effect on the waves. Solutions\nare obtained by solving a coupled-mode system, similar to\nEq.(5), but extended to two horizontal dimensions (x, y),\nand coupled with the boundary conditions ensuring outgoing\nradiation. The spatial grid for the scattered field is extended\nwith a damping layer all around the boundary [Belibassakis\net al., 2001].\nBoth 2D and 3D implementations of this NTUA5 model\nare used here to investigate wave propagation over a submarine canyon. If we neglect the sloping-bottom mode and\nthe evanescent modes, and retain in the local-mode series\nonly the propagating mode \u03c60 (x, y), this model (NTUA5)\nexactly reduces to MMSE [e.g. Chandrasekara and Cheung,\n1997],\n\u2207(CCg )\n*\u2207\u03c60 (x, y)\nCC\n\u0002 2 g 2\n\u0003\n+ k0 + f1 \u2207 h + f2 (\u2207h)2 \u03c60 (x, y) = 0,\n\n\u22072 \u03c60 (x, y) +\n\n(8)\nFigure 1. Bathymetry around La Jolla and Scripps\ncanyons, and definition of transverse sections for idealized calculations.\n\n0\n20\ndepth (m)\n\nwhere f1 = f1 (x, y) and f2 = f2 (x, y) are respectively functions dependent on the bottom curvature and slope-squared\nterms. From Eq.(7), the MSE is obtained by further neglecting the curvature and slope-squared terms.\nIn the following sections, these two formulations (MSE\nand MMSE) will be compared to the full 5-mode model\nto examine the importance of steep bottom slope effects,\nwhich are fully accounted for in this model. The MSE and\nMMSE solutions are obtained by exactly the same scattering method described above with the same computer code\nin which the high order bottom slope terms and/or evanescent modes are turned off. For 3D calculations, our use of\na regular grid sets important constraints on the model implementation due to the requirements to have the offshore\nboundary in deep water and sufficient resolution to resolve\nthe wavelength of waves in the shallowest parts of the model\ndomain. These constraints put practical limits on the domain size for a given wave period and range of water depths.\nHere a minimum of 7 points per wavelength in 10 m depth\nwas enforced, in a domain that extends 4\u20136 km offshore.\nSuch a large domain with a high resolution leads to memory\nintensive inversion of large sparse matrices. However, the\nNTUA, MSE and MMSE models are linear, and thus the\npropagation of the different offshore wave components can\nbe performed separately, sequentially or in parallel.\nBefore considering the full complexity of the 3D ScrippsLa Jolla Canyon system, we first examine the behavior of\nthese models in the case of monochromatic waves propagating over 2D idealized canyon profiles (transverse sections\nof the actual canyons). We consider both the relatively\nwide La Jolla Canyon where infragravity wave reflection\nwas reported recently [Thomson et al. 2005], and the narrow Scripps Canyon, that was the focus of the NCEX swell\npropagation study.\n\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\nx (m)\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nFigure 2. Water depth across the La Jolla canyon section.\nReflection coefficients R for the wave amplitude are computed using the MSE, the MMSE, and the full coupled-mode\nmodel NTUA5. R is easily obtained using the natural decomposition provided by the scattering method, and is defined as the ratio between the scattered wave potential amplitude, up-wave of the topography, and the amplitude of\n\n\fX-4\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\nthe imposed propagating wave. In addition, a stepwise bottom approximation model developed by Rey [1992], based on\nthe matching of integral quantities at the boundaries of adjacent steps, is used to evaluate R [see Takano, 1960; Miles,\n1967; Kirby and Dalrymple, 1983]. This model is known\nto converge to the exact value of R, and will be used as a\nbenchmark for this study.\n\n.\nFigure 3. Amplitude reflection coefficient R for waves\npropagating at normal incidence over the La Jolla canyon\nsection (figure 2) using several numerical models, and observed infragravity reflections for near-normal incidence\nangles [Thomson et al., 2005]\n\nFigure 4. Water depth across the Scripps canyon section.\nThe canyon profile is resolved with 70 steps which was\nfound to be sufficient to obtain a converging result. The\npredicted values of R as a function of wave frequency f\n(Figure 3), are characterized by maxima and minima, which\nare similar to the rectangular step response shown in Mei\nand Black [1969], Kirby and Dalrymple [1983a], and Rey et\nal. [1992]. The spacing between the minima or maxima is\ndefined by the width of the step or trench, which imposes\n\nresonance conditions, leading to constructive or destructive\ninterferences. Both the MSE and MMSE models are found\nto generally overestimate the reflection at high frequencies,\nwhereas the NTUA5 model is in good agreement with the\nbenchmark solution. The sloping-bottom mode included in\nNTUA5 has a negligible impact on the wave reflection in\nthis and other cases discussed below. The only other difference between the NTUA5 and the MMSE models is the\naddition of the evanescent modes which, through their effect\non the near wave field solution modify significantly the far\nfield, including the overall reflection and transmission over\nthe canyon.\nThomson et al. [2005] investigated the transmission of\ninfra-gravity waves with frequencies in the range 0.006\u2013\n0.05 Hz across this same canyon. Based on pressure and\nvelocity time series at two points located approximately at\nthe ends of the La Jolla section these authors estimated energy reflection coefficients as a function of frequency. In a\ncase of near-normal incidence they observed a minimum of\nwave reflection at about 0.04 Hz, generally consistent with\nthe present results (figure 3). Thomson et al. [2005] further\nfound a good fit of their observations to the theoretical reflection across a rectangular trench as given by Kirby and\nDalrymple [1983] in the limit of long waves, and neglecting\nevanescent modes. This approximation is appropriate for\nthe long infragravity band for which the effects of evanescent\nmodes are relatively weak. The observations of Thomson\net al. [2005] also agree well with the various models applied\nhere to the actual canyon profile (figure 3). At higher swell\nfrequencies (f > 0.05 Hz), the MSE, MMSE and NTUA\nmodel results diverge for normal incidence (figure 3). However, contrary to the beach-generated infragravity waves,\nswell arrives from the open ocean and thus always reaches\nthis canyon with a large oblique angle, for which the differences between these models are small (not shown).\n3.2. Transverse section of Scripps Canyon\n3.2.1. Normal incidence\nThe north branch of the canyon system, Scripps Canyon,\nprovides a very different effect due to a larger depth (145\nm) and a smaller width (250 m). Scripps Canyon is also\nmarkedly asymmetric with different depths on either side.\nA representative section of this canyon is chosen here (Figure 4). The bottom bottom slope locally exceeds 3, i.e. the\nbottom makes an angle up to 70\u25e6 with the vertical. Reflection coefficient predictions for waves propagating at normal\nincidence over the canyon section are shown in Figure 5. R\ndecreases with increasing frequency without the pronounced\nside lobe pattern predicted for the La Jolla Canyon section.\nAgain, the NTUA5 results are in excellent agreement with\nthe exact solution. The MSE dramatically underestimates R\nat low frequencies, and overestimates R at high frequencies.\nHowever, the MMSE is in fairly good agreement with the\nbenchmark solution in this case, suggesting that the higher\norder bottom slope terms are important for the steep Scripps\nCanyon profile reflection, while the evanescent modes play\nonly a minor role.\n3.2.2. Oblique incidence\nThe swell observed near Scripps Canyon generally arrives\nat a large oblique angle at the offshore canyon rim. To examine the influence of the incidence angle \u03b8i , a representative\nswell frequency f = 0.067 Hz was selected, and the reflection\ncoefficient was evaluated as a function of \u03b8i . The amplitude\nreflection coefficient R is very weak when \u03b8i is small, and\nas \u03b8i increases, R jumps to near-total reflection within a\nnarrow band of direction around 35\u25e6 (Figure 6).\n\n\fX-5\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\ngle \u03b8B , all the wave energy is trapped, and no energy goes\nthrough the canyon. This sharp transition does not depend\non the magnitude of the gradient which may even be infinite. For a shelf depth H1 and maximum canyon depth\nHmax , this threshold angle is given by\n\u03b8B = arcsin\n\nFigure 5. Reflection coefficient for the Scripps Canyon\nsection as a function of frequency predicted by various\nmodels. (a) normal incidence \u03b8i = 0\u25e6 , (b) \u03b8i = 45\u25e6 . All\nmodels collapse on the same curve in (b).\n\nFigure 6. Reflection coefficient for waves of period\nT = 16 s propagating over the Scripps Canyon section as\na function of the wave incidence angle \u03b8i (0 corresponds\nto waves travelling perpendicular to the canyon axis).\nIndeed, for a wave train propagating through a medium\nwith phase speed gradient in one dimension only, geometrical optics predicts that beyond a threshold (Brewster) an-\n\n\u0010 C \u0011\n1\nCmax\n\n(9)\n\nwhere C1 and Cmax are the phase speeds for a given frequency corresponding to the depths H1 and Hmax . Thus \u03b8B\nincreases with increasing frequency as the phase speed difference diminishes at high frequencies. For Scripps Canyon,\nH1 = 24 m, and Hmax = 145 m. At f = 0.067 Hz this gives\n\u03b8B = 38\u25e6 . As a result, for \u03b8i < \u03b8B , no reflection is predicted by refraction theory (dashed line), and all the wave\nenergy is transmitted through the canyon. This threshold\nvalue separates distinct reflection and refraction (trapping)\nphenomena, respectively occurring for \u03b8i < \u03b8B and \u03b8i > \u03b8B .\nThe elliptic models that account for diffraction predict\na smoother transition. For \u03b8i < \u03b8B , weak reflection is predicted. For \u03b8i > \u03b8B , a fraction of the energy is still transmitted through the canyon. This transmission of wave energy\nacross a deep region where sin \u03b8i /C1 exceeds 1/Cmax , violates the geometrical optics approximation. This transmission is similar to the tunnelling of quantum particles through\na barrier of potential in the case where the barrier thickness\nis of the order of the wavelength or less [Thomson et al.,\n2005]. The wave field near the turning point of wave rays in\nthe canyon decays exponentially in space on the scale of the\nwavelength [e.g. Chao and Pierson, 1972], and that decaying wave excites a propagating wave on the other side of the\ncanyon. This coupling of both canyon sides generally decreases as the canyon width or the incidence angle increase\n[Kirby and Dalrymple, 1983; Thomson at al., 2005]. The significant differences between MSE and MMSE at small angles\n\u03b8i < \u03b8B are less pronounced for \u03b8i > \u03b8B .\nThese two regimes are illustrated by the evolution of the\nwave potential amplitude over the Scripps canyon section.\nIn figure 7, results of various elliptic models (MSE, MMSE\nand NTUA5) are compared with a parabolic approximation of the MSE (the REF/DIF1 model of Dalrymple and\nKirby [1988]). It should be noted that the model grid orientation is chosen with the main axis along the incident\nwave propagation direction, in order to minimize large angle errors in the parabolic approximation. In that configuration, the parabolic approximation (REF/DIF1 a) does\nnot predict any reflection, but gives an indication of the\nexpected shoaling of the incident waves across the canyon.\nFor \u03b8i = 30\u25e6 < \u03b8B , weak reflection (about 10%) is predicted\nby the MMSE and NTUA5 (figure 7.a). MSE considerably\noverestimates the reflection, and thus underestimates the\ntransmitted energy down-wave of the canyon section. A\npartial standing wave pattern is predicted up-wave of the\ncanyon as a result of the interference of incident and reflected waves. The largest amplitudes, about 20% larger\nthan the incident wave amplitude, occur in the first antinode near the canyon wall.\nFor a larger wave incidence angle (e.g. 45\u25e6 > \u03b8B ), an almost complete standing wave pattern is predicted by the elliptic models up-wave of the canyon, with an exponential tail\nthat extends across the canyon to a weak transmitted component (see also Figure 5.b for the reflection coefficient pattern). Finally, transmission is extremely weak for \u03b8i = 70\u25e6\n(figure 7.c). A good estimate of the reflection coefficient can\nalso be obtained with the parabolic model REF/DIF1 b by\nchoosing the x-axis to be aligned with the canyon trench\n(figure 7b,c thick dashed lines).\n\n\fX-6\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\nrotated 45\u25e6 relative to North to place the offshore boundary\nin the deepest region of the domain. Models were run for\nmany sets of incident wave frequency and direction (f , \u03b8).\n\nFigure 7. Wave amplitude over the Scripps Canyon\nsection, for T = 16 s and different incident angles (a)\n\u03b8i = 30\u25e6 , (b) \u03b8i = 45\u25e6 , and (c) \u03b8i = 70\u25e6 . The canyon\ndepth profile is indicated with a thin dashed line. The\nMMSE result is in distinguishable from that of NTUA5\nin all panels, and all models except for REF/DIF1 give\nthe same results in (b) and (c).\n\n4. West Swell Over Scripps Canyon\nThe models used in the previous section (MSE, MMSE,\nNTUA5, REF/DIF1, refraction) are now applied to the real\n3D bottom topography of the Scripps-La Jolla Canyon system, and compared with field data from directional wave\nbuoys deployed around the rim and over Scripps Canyon\nduring NCEX.\n4.1. Models Set-up\nThe implementations of MSE, MMSE, NTUA5, and\nREF/DIF1 use two computational domains with grids of\n275 by 275 points (Figure 8). The larger domain with a grid\nresolution of 21 m is used for wave periods longer than 15 s.\nThe smaller domain, with a higher resolution of about 15 m,\nis used for 15 s and shorter waves. The y-axis of the grid is\n\nFigure 8. Computational domain for (a) T > 15 s, and\n(b) T \u2264 15 s. Also shown are the NTUA5 solutions for\nthe real part of the wave potential amplitude for waves\narriving from 270\u25e6 with periods (a) T = 16 s, and (b)\nT = 15 s, superimposed on the 10, 30, 100, 200, and\n300 m depth contours.\n\n\fMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\nThe CPU time required for one (f, \u03b8) wave component\ncalculation with the NTUA5 model (with 3 evanescent\nmodes) is about 120 s on a Linux computer with 2Gb of\nmemory and a 3 GHz processor. The wave periods and offshore directions used in the computation range from 12 to\n22 s and 255 to 340 degrees respectively, with 0.2 s and 2\u25e6\nincrements. The minimum period 12 s corresponds to the\nshortest waves that can be resolved with 7 points per wavelength in 10 m depth. Shorter waves are not considered here\nbecause they may be affected by local wind generation, not\nrepresented in the models used here, and are also generally\nless affected by the bottom topography.\n\nX-7\n\ndirection bin (bandwidth 0.005 Hz by 5 degrees), computed\nover the finest available bathymetry grid, with 4 m resolution. The model is identical to the CREST model described\nby Ardhuin et al. [2001], and validated by Ardhuin et al.\n[2003] on the U.S. East coast. The energy source term set\nto zero here. This propagation-only version of the model is\nalso called CRESTp, and is similar to the model used by\nO'Reilly and Guza [1993] and Peak [2004]. It was further\nvalidated on the West coast of France [Ardhuin, 2006].\n4.2. Model-Data Comparison\nLong swell from the west was observed on 30 November 2003, in the absence of significant local winds. In the\npresent analysis we use only data from Datawell Directional\nWaverider buoys. The Torrey Pines Outer Buoy is permanently deployed by the Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP), and located about 15 km offshore of Scripps\nCanyon. That buoy provided the deep water observations\nnecessary to drive the wave models. The directional distribution of energy for each frequency was estimated from\nbuoy measurements of displacement cross-spectra using the\nMaximum Entropy Method [Lygre and Krogstad, 1986]. The\nNCEX observations were made at six sites around the head\nof Scripps Canyon (figure 9).\nAll spectra used in the comparison, including the offshore boundary condition, were averaged from 13:30 to 16:30\nUTC, so that the almost continuous record yields about 100\ndegrees of freedom for each frequency band with a width of\n0.005 Hz. On that day the wind speed close to the coast did\nnot exceed 3 m s\u22121 , as measured by the CDIP Torrey Pines\nGlider port anemometer, and the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 46086, located 70 km West of San Diego\nand representative of the entire modelled area.\nThe observed narrow offshore spectrum has a single peak\nwith a period of 14.5 s, and a mean direction of 272 degrees, corresponding to an incidence angle \u03b8i (relative to\nthe Scripps Canyon axis) of 65\u25e6 (Figure10).\n\nFigure 9. Location of directional wave buoys at the\nhead of the Scripps canyon, and wave rays for an offshore direction of 272\u25e6 and a period of 15.4 s, corresponding to a frequency just below the peak of the observed\nswell on November 30. Contrary to the backward ray\ntracing model used for estimating the wave spectrum at\nnearshore sites, rays were integrated forward from parallel directions and equally spaced positions at 15 m intervals along the offshore boundary at x = 0, 10 km to the\nWest of the buoys, practically in deep water.\nTransfer functions between the local and offshore wave\namplitudes were evaluated at each of the buoy locations\nand used to transform the offshore spectrum. The backward ray-tracing refraction model directly evaluates energy\nspectral transfer functions between deep water, where the\nwave spectrum is assumed to be uniform, and each of the\nbuoys located close to the canyon, based on the invariance\nof the wavenumber spectrum along a ray [Longuet-Higgins,\n1957]. A minimum of 50 rays was used for each frequency-\n\nFigure 10. Directional wave spectrum at Torrey Pines\nOuter Buoy at 15:00 UTC on 30 November 2003.\nThe model hindcasts are compared with observations in\nFigure 11. While the local amplification of the wave height\nat the head of canyon varies with the incident wave direction, a dramatic reduction of the wave height downwave of\nthe rim of this canyon is predicted for all directions. Thus\n\n\fX-8\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\nthe selected west swell case (Tp = 14.5s, \u03b8 = 272\u25e6 ) is representative of the general wave transformation in this area,\nfor low frequency swells arriving a large range of directions.\nSignificant wave heights Hs were computed from the measured and predicted wave spectra at each instrument location, including only the commonly modelled frequency range\n(f1 = 0.05 Hz, f2 = 0.08 Hz). The predicted Hs is given by\nHs = 4\n\n\u0012Z\n\nf2\n\nf1\n\nZ\n\n\u03b82\n\n\u03b81\n\nM (f, \u03b8)E(f, \u03b8)df d\u03b8\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\nin figure 12.a-b with NTUA5 predictions at sites 34 at the\nhead of the canyon, and 37 behind the canyon.\n\n(10)\n\nwhere E(f, \u03b8) is the observed offshore frequency-directional\nspectrum and M (f, \u03b8) is the model prediction of the ratio\nbetween the local and offshore wave energies for the frequency f and offshore direction \u03b8, obtained by squaring the\nsea surface elevation transfer function.\nObservations show a dramatic variation in wave height\nacross the canyon (figure 11).\n\nFigure 11. Comparison of predicted and observed significant wave height (12s < T < 22s) for the 30 November 2003 swell event. Instrument locations are shown in\nfigure 9.\n\nFigure 12. Amplitude transfer functions at site 34 (a)\nand site 37 (b), defined as the ratio of the local and\noffshore wave amplitude modulus and computed with\nNTUA 5.\n\nThe offshore wave height is slightly enhanced at sites 33\nand 34, in water depths of 34 and 23 m respectively, along\nthe north side of the canyon, and slightly reduced on the\nshelf north of the canyon at site 35, in 34 m depth. A dramatic reduction in wave heights is observed at sites 36, 37\nand 32, over the Canyon and on the south side, where the\nwater depths are 111, 49 and 24 m, respectively. Between\nbuoys 34 and 36 the wave height drops by a factor 5 over\na distance of only 150 m, that is less than the 216 m wavelength at the peak frequency (at the shallowest of the two\nsites). Such a pattern is generally consistent with refraction theory as illustrated by forward ray-tracing in figure 9.\nWhereas rays crossing the shelf north of the canyon show the\nexpected gradual bending towards the shore, rays that reach\nthe canyon northern wall are trapped on the shelf, and reach\nthe shore in a focusing region north of the canyon (Black's\nbeach). From that offshore direction, and an offshore ray\nspacing of 15 m, no rays are predicted to cross the canyon,\nso that the south side of the canyon is effectively sheltered\nfrom 16 s Westerly swells, in agreement with the observed\nextremely low wave heights (figure 11, see also Peak [2004]).\nThe amplitude transfer functions (M (f, \u03b8)1/2 ) are not overly\nsensitive to the wave frequency and direction, as illustrated\n\nUp-wave of the canyon (instruments 33, 34, 35), all models are found to be in fairly good agreement with the observations. However, REF/DIF1 underestimates the wave\nheight at site 34. At this site, wave energy is strongly focused by refraction, with rays turning by more that 90\u25e6 (figure 9). The parabolic approximation does not allow such a\nlarge variation in wave direction. Over and down-wave of\nthe canyon (instruments 32, 36, 37), the wave heights predicted by MSE, MMSE and NTUA5 agree reasonably well\nwith the observations, whereas REF/DIF1 slightly overestimates the wave height. For f < 0.06 Hz few rays cross the\ncanyon and the energy predicted by the refraction model is\nextremely low, about 5% of the offshore energy the total energy. This strong variation in wave energy across the canyon\nis reduced by diffraction, which is not taken into account in\nthis refraction model, resulting in an under-prediction of the\nwave height at the sheltered sites 32, 36, and 37.\nThe sea state at that time also include an important\ncontribution from higher frequencies (figure 13). Significant wave heights computed over a wider frequency range\n(0.05 < f < 0.2Hz), by adding the refraction model results\nto the low-frequency results of other models, vary little between the models, now dominated by short wave energy.\n\n\fMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\nX-9\n\nference in offshore and local spectra on figure 13), while\ndiffraction effects are significant, in that area, only up to\n0.07 Hz. Further confirmation of the trapping of low frequency waves is provided by another case observed on 12\nDecember 2003 (Figure 14), which we analyze with the same\nmethod. The observed spectra are averaged from 12:00 UTC\nto 15:00 UTC.The observed spectrum has three peaks with\na period of 20, 12.5 and 9 s, a mean direction of 270, 270\nand 285 degrees respectively and a significant wave height\nof 1.9m.\n\nFigure 13. Comparison of predicted and observed frequency spectra at (a) site 35, and (b) site 37, for the 30\nNovember 2003 swell event.\n\nFigure 14. Directional wave spectrum at Torrey Pines\nOuter Buoy at 12:00 UTC on 12 December 2003.\nHowever, wave heights are still markedly different between the buoys. It thus appears that refraction plays an\nimportant role for frequencies up to 0.14 Hz (see the dif-\n\nFigure 15. Comparison of predicted and observed significant wave height (12s < T < 22s) for the 12 December 2003 swell event. Instrument locations are shown in\nfigure 9.\nThe model hindcasts are compared with observations in\nFigure 15. Significant wave heights Hs were computed from\nthe measured and predicted wave spectra at each instrument\nlocation, including only the commonly modelled frequency\nrange (f1 = 0.05Hz, f2 = 0.08Hz). On that day the wind\nspeed did not exceed 7 m s\u22121 , as measured by the CDIP\nTorrey Pines Glider port anemometer, but reached 13.5 m,\nblowing from the North West, at NDBC buoy 46086. Such a\nwind is capable of generating a local wave field with frequencies down to 0.095 Hz for fully-developed wave conditions.\nAs in the previous case, a large variation in wave height\nwas observed across the Canyon (Figure 15). Again, that\nvariation remains limited to a factor 10 difference for any\nwave frequency (compare Figure 16a and b), whereas the\ngeometrical optics approximation predicts much larger gradients. We note a general agreement of the predicted wave\nheight by the models, with an underestimation of the refraction model for sites located down-wave of the Canyon.\nThe predicted frequency spectra are represented on Figure\n16a,b at sites 35 and 37. At site 35, located up-wave of the\nCanyon wall, NTUA5 and REF/DIF1 models are in a good\nagreement with the measurement for the low frequency peak\n(0.05 Hz), but underestimate the 0.08Hz peak. The refraction model overestimates the low frequency peak, but is in\ngood agreement with the 0.08Hz peak. At site 37, located\ndown-wave of the Canyon, NTUA5 and REF/DIF1 predict\na strongly attenuated low frequency peak, as is observed,\nwhereas the refraction model predicts no energy transmission across the canyon. Below a cut-off frequency of about\n0.065 Hz, the canyon acts as a complete barrier in the geometrical optics approximation. The energy in the second\npeak at 0.08 Hz is only reduced by a factor 4 across the\ncanyon, an effect well described by all models, and thus attributable to refraction. All models generally agree with the\n\n\fX - 10\n\nMAGNE ET AL.: WAVES OVER SUBMARINE CANYONS\n\nobservations for 0.07 < f < 0.2, within the spectrum measurement confidence interval, except for an overestimation\nof the refraction model for the high frequency peaks (0.11\nand 0.14 Hz) of the spectrum. However, due to the local\nwind sea generation between the offshore buoy and locations around the canyon, these propagation models are not\nreliable for f > 0.095 Hz.\n\nFigure 16. Comparison of predicted and observed frequency spectra at (a) site 35, and (b) site 37, 12 December 2003 swell event.\nIn the two events most of the wave evolution is accounted\nfor by refraction. However, diffraction is included in the\nmodels based on the MSE and its extensions, and this effect\nallows for a tunnelling of wave energy across the canyon.\nIn these models, wave heights across the canyon are thus\nlarger, in better agreement with observed wave heights and\nwave spectra at the sheltered sites 32, 36 and 37 (figures 11,\n13, 15).\nThe differences between NTUA5, MSE and MMSE model\npredictions are very small and thus only NTUA5 results are\nshown in figure 13. It may appear surprising that the wave\nheight behind the canyon is still 20% of the offshore wave\nheight whereas the 2D simulations with comparable incidence angles yield wave heights much less than 5%. However, the Scripps Canyon is neither infinitely long nor uniform along its axis. The three-dimensional topography apparently reduces the blocking effect of long period swells\nthat was found over two-dimensional canyons.\n\n5. Summary\nObservations of the evolution of swell across a submarine canyon obtained in the nearshore canyon experiment (NCEX), were compared with predictions of refraction and combined refraction-diffraction models including\nthe coupled-mode model NTUA5 valid for arbitrary bottom\nslope [Athanassoulis and Belibassakis, 1999; Belibassakis et\nal., 2001]. Predictions of a spectral refraction model are\nin good agreement with observations [see also Peak, 2004\nfor the entire experiment], demonstrating that refraction is\nthe dominant process in swell transformation across Scripps\nCanyon. The geometrical optics approximation, on which\nthe refraction model is based, turned out to be very robust.\nAccurate spectral predictions were obtained with taht model\neven in cases where the wave energy changes by a factor of\n10 over three quarters of a wavelength.\nFor waves longer than 12 s, even larger gradients are predicted by the refraction model, but these gradients are not\nobserved. At those frequencies, accurate results were obtained with the NTUA5 model and elliptic mild slope equation models that include diffraction, which acts as a limiter on the wave energy gradients. Differences between the\nmodels were clarified with 2D simulations using representative transverse profiles of La Jolla and Scripps Canyons,\nshowing the behavior of the far wave field as a function of\nthe incidence angle. The underestimation by the refraction\nmodel may be interpreted as the result of wave tunnelling,\ni.e. a transmission of waves to water depths greater than\nallowed by Snel's law, for obliquely incident waves [see also,\nThomson et al., 2005 ]. This tunnelling effect cannot be\nrepresented in the geometrical optics approximation, and\nthus the refraction model predicts that all wave energy is\ntrapped for large incidence angles relative to the depth contours, while a small fraction of the wave energy is in fact\ntransmitted across the canyon. Although different from the\nclassical diffraction effect behind a breakwater [e.g. Mei\n1989], this tunnelling is a form of diffraction in the sense\nthat it prevents a sharp spatial variation of wave amplitude,\nand induces a leakage of wave energy in areas forbidden by\ngeometrical optics.\nObservations were also compared with a parabolic\nrefraction-diffraction model that is known to be inaccurate\nfor large oblique wave directions relative to the numerical\ngrid, and is shown here to overestimate the amplitude of\nwaves transmitted across the canyon and underestimate the\namplitude of waves focused at the head of the canyon. Finally, depending on the bottom profile and incidence angle, higher order bottom slope and curvature terms (incorporated in modified mild slope equations and NTUA5), as\nwell as evanescent and sloping-bottom modes (included in\nNTUA5) can be important for an accurate representation of\nwave propagation over a canyon at small incidence angles.\nFor large incidence angles, that are more common for natural canyons across the shelf break, the standard mild slope\nequation (MSE) gives an accurate representation of the variations in surface elevation spectra that is similar to that of\nthe full NTUA5 model. Yet, further analysis of NCEX bottom velocity and pressure measurements may show that the\nMSE or other mild slope models may not accurately represent near bottom wave properties, as also discussed by\nAthanassoulis et al. [2003].\nAcknowledgments.
