The conventional\ndefinition of NLS1s consists of two criteria: 1) a narrow width of the broad Balmer emission\nline (F W HM(H\u03b2) < 2 000 km s\u22121 ); and 2) weak forbidden lines ([OIII]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 < 3).\nSubsequent studies revealed their other unusual properties, such as 1) strong FeII multiplet\nemission (e.g., Boroson & Green 1992; Grupe et al. 1999; Veron et al. 2001; Zhou et al.\n2006); 2) steep soft X-ray spectra (Wang et al. 1996; Boller et al. 1996; Grupe et al. 1998);\n3) rapid and large amplitudes of X-ray variability (e.g., Leighly 1999; Komossa et al. 2000);\nand 4) commonly blue shifted UV line profiles (e.g., Leighly & Moore 2004). These unusual\nproperties are in fact an extension to the extremity of a set of correlations between H\u03b2 line\nwidth and the other observables. These correlations form the so-called eigenvector 1 (E1,\nBoroson & Green 1992; Sulentic et al. 2000). E1 is considered as the manifestation of the\nvariation of one or a certain combination of several fundamental parameters of AGNs, such\nas the black hole mass and/or accretion rate.\nNLS1s are usually radio-quiet (RQ) with radio loudness R < 10 (defined as radio to\nB-band optical flux ratio, R \u2261 f5GHz /fB ). The last decade has witnessed the identification\nof about two dozen radio-loud (RL) NLS1s (Grupe et al. 2000; Zhou & Wang 2002; Zhou et\nal. 2003; Zhou et al. 2005; Komossa et al. 2006a,b; Zhou et al. 2006). Given the intriguing\nfact that RL AGNs and \"normal\" NLS1s occupy the opposite extremes of the E1 parameter\nspace (Boroson 2002), the study of RL NLS1s may provide important clues to understanding\nthe physical drivers of E1.\nFirst proposed by Spiegel in 1978 to refer to rapidly variable AGNs, blazars, including\nBL Lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ), are another small distinct subset of\nAGNs. An operational definition is: flat radio spectrum above 1 GHz, fast variability, high\nand variable polarization, superluminal motion, and high brightness temperature (Urry &\nPadova 1995). Blazars are believed to be radio loud AGN viewed (almost) along the direction\nof their radio jets; so that non-thermal jet emission is relativistically boosted. In our recent\nwork, we found that the two radio loudest NLS1s, SDSS J094857.3+002225 (Zhou et al. 2003)\nand 0846+51W1 (Zhou et al. 2005), both show blazar-like behavior. These results suggest\nthat relativistic beaming may play an important role in very radio loud (VRL) NLS1s.\nIn this letter, we report the discovery of an appealing NLS1\u2013blazar composite object,\nJ032441.19+341045.9 (hereafter 2MASX J0324+3410), an extreme and the best example so\nfar in the line of the NLS1-blazar connection. This object was first observed spectroscopically\nby Remillard et al. (1993) as an optical counterpart of an X-ray source detected in the HEAO-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1 X-ray survey, and was classified as a Seyfert 1 galaxy. It was subsequently observed by\nMarch\u00e3 et al. (1996) but was (mis-)classified as a narrow line radio galaxy (NLRG). Here\nwe present our new spectroscopic observation and classification, along with its broad band\nproperty; we defer to a future paper for detailed analyses of its full data set from both\narchives and our on-going monitoring observations. Throughout this paper, we assume a\ncosmology with H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.\n\n2.\n\nObservations, data analysis, and broad band properties\n2.1.\n\nOptical Spectroscopy and NLS1 classification\n\nWe took spectra of 2MASX J0324+3410 with the OMR spectrograph attached to the\nCassegrain focus of the 2.16m telescope at Xinglong Station of National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC) on Nov 25, 2005. A 1200 line mm\u22121 grating (50 \u00c5 mm\u22121\ndispersion) and a Tek 1300 \u00d7 1024 CCD were used to cover a wavelength range of 1200\n\u00c5 centered at 5100 \u00c5. Four exposures of 60 minutes each were taken. KPNO standard\nstars were observed for absolute flux calibration. A slit width of 2.\u2032\u2032 5 was chosen to match\nthe seeing disk. The spectral resolution as measured from the night-sky lines was 2.75\u00c5 at\nFWHM. The CCD reduction, including bias subtraction, flat-field correction, and cosmic-ray\nremoval were accomplished following the standard procedures using IRAF. The spectra were\nextracted and combined into a 1-D spectrum with the Galactic extinction E(B\u2212V ) = 0m .213\ncorrected.\nWe fit the spectrum with the following model components: 1) a power law continuum;\n2) two Gaussians for the [OIII]\u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007 doublet; 3) two Lorentzians for H\u03b2 and H\u03b3,\nrespectively; and 4) the optical FeII multiplets of V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. (2004). The redshifts\nand profiles of the [OIII] doublet are taken to be the same, and their flux ratio is fixed\nto the theoretical value. We also assume that the broad component of H\u03b2, H\u03b3, and the\nFeII multiplets have the same redshifts and line profiles; and the same assumption is for the\nnarrow component of these lines1 . The result is displayed in Figure 1. We also tried to fit the\nbroad component of the Balmer lines with Gaussian, and found that they cannot be fitted\nwith a single Gaussian but two Gaussians are needed. This latter model yields somewhat\nbroader FWHM but similar line strength compared to the former Lorentzian model for both\nthe FeII and Balmer lines.\nThe redshift of 2MASX J0324+3410 as determined from [OIII] is z = 0.0629 \u00b1 0.0001,\n1\n\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty's FeII model includes forbidden FeII lines.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nconsistent with that of the Balmer lines within the measurement uncertainties. The Balmer\nline width, FWHM = 1 520 km s\u22121 for a Lorentzian model and 1 650 km s\u22121 for a double\nGaussian model (after correction for instrumental broadening), is narrower than that of\nnormal Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars, but typical of NLS1s. The line ratio [OIII]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2\nis \u2243 0.12 and is almost independent of the choice of the line profiles. This value indicates\nthat the bulk of the Balmer emission lines do not originate from the narrow line region\n(NLR) and hence excludes the possibility that 2MASX J0324+3410 is a type 2 AGN, e.g. a\nNLRG, as was claimed in March\u00e3 et al. (1996).\nThe optical FeII complexes are rather strong with EW (F eII\u03bb4570) \u223c 130\u00c5 and R4570 \u2261\nF eII\u03bb4570/H\u03b2 \u223c 2.0, where the FeII blend is integrated from 4434 to 4684 \u00c5 for both\nbroad and narrow components with larger EW(FeII) and R4570 for the Lorentzian model.\nRemillard et al. (1993) reported a R4570 = 1.54. In summary, our optical spectrum clearly\nshows that 2MASX J0324+3410 is a classic NLS1.\n\n2.2.\n\nBroad Band Properties and SED\n\nRadiation from 2MASX J0324+3410 was detected in a wide wavelength range across\nalmost the whole electromagnetic spectrum, in the radio, infrared (IRAS and 2MASS),\noptical band (e.g., Swift UVOT), X-ray and possibly \u03b3-ray bands. It is a strong radio source\nwith a flux density 304\u2212581 mJy at 5 GHz, and shows a flat radio spectrum up to at least\n10 GHz and significant flux variations. Using simultaneous observations at 2.695, 4.75, and\n10.55 GHz, Neumann et al. (1994) found a flat spectral index, \u03b1 \u2243 0.1, and detected\npolarization at the 3%, 5%, and 4% level, respectively. A factor of 1.3 variation ( 4\u03c3 level)\nin its 1.4 GHz flux on time-scales of ten years was found by comparing the Green Bank 1.4\nGHz Northern Sky Survey (GBNSS, White & Becker 1992) and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey\n(Condon et al. 1998). Even larger amplitude variations (a factor of 1.6 and 1.9) on shorter\ntime scales (3.5 and 3.3 yrs) were observed at 5 GHz (Neumann et al. 1994; Griffith et al.\n1991; Laurent-Muehleisen et al. 1997). These variations are significant at the 3\u20136 \u03c3 level,\nand cannot be attributed to source contamination as the beam sizes for observations at the\nhigher flux states are (fortunately) smaller than those at the lower states. Assuming the flux\nvariability is intrinsic, we can derive a lower limit on the brightness temperature of 5\u00d71011 K\n(c.f., Zhou et al. 2006). This value is an order of magnitude higher than the equipartition\nvalue \u223c 5 \u00d7 1010 K (e.g., Readhead 1994) but close to the inverse Compton limit of 1012 K\n(Kellermann & Pauliny-Toth 1969).\nThe source was also observed by the VLBA in the VLBA calibrator survey (VCS). High\nresolution images at 2.2 GHz and 8.4 GHz reveal a core and a weak extended south-west\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ncomponent 6.8 mas (8.2 pc) away from the core (Beasley et al. 2002). We have re-processed\nthe VLBA data. The core is further resolved into a brightest component in the north-east\nand an extension towards the south-west, reminiscent of a core\u2013jet structure. The brightest\ncompact component has a deconvolved size of about 0.1 mas (0.12 pc) and a flux of 0.165\nJy at 8.4 GHz, leading to a brightness temperature of about 4\u00d71011 K, consistent with the\nestimate from the variability analysis above. The south-west component has a steep radio\nspectrum and seems to have no proper motion (< 0.05c; Yuan W. et al. in preparation),\nand therefore is possibly a weak radio lobe.\nThe radio loudness of 2MASX J0324+3410 is estimated to be R = f5GHz /fB = 38 \u2212 71\nusing the HST magnitude and assuming \u03b1opt = 0.5 for the nucleus. If we adopt the swift\nUVOT B magnitude of B=16.11 mag, we obtain R \u224389-151, after correction for Galactic\nextinction. Note that the Swift B magnitude may include some contamination of the galactic\nlight (see last section), so there can be a significant variation between the Swift and HST\nobservations. Since the 5 GHz radio emission is likely subject to substantial enhancement\ndue to the Doppler beaming effect, we try to estimate its 'intrinsic radio loudness' using\na low-frequency flux, which is thought to be less affected by Doppler boosting. Assuming\ntypical spectral indices \u03b1r = 0.7\u22121.0 for the extended radio components, we find an 'intrinsic\nradio loudness' 4\u201325 from the radio flux 1.02 Jy at 151 MHz (Hales, Baldwin & Warner 1993).\nThis puts 2MASX J0324+3410 in the class of radio intermediate quasars. Its radio power,\nat 178 MHz, P178MHz . 8 \u00d7 1024 W Hz \u22121 , as interpolated from the one at 151 MHz, is below\nthe dividing line separating the FR II and FR I types.\nX-ray emission as well as hard X-ray (and perhaps even \u03b3-ray) flares have been detected\nfrom 2MASX J0324+3410 by various instruments. For observations with ROSAT and Swift,\nwe reduced the publicly available data to derive the X-ray spectra and fluxes; for the rest\nof the data sets (mainly sky monitor type instruments), we made use of the X-ray count\nrates provided as available from NED. Hard X-ray emission was detected with the HEDs\n(High Energy Detectors, 2.6\u201360 keV) on-board HEAO-1 at three epochs over a time span\nof one year, when it showed decreasing averaged count rates from 1.25 \u00b1 0.39 cts s\u22121 to\n0.01 \u00b1 0.26 cts s\u22121 . It was also detected in the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS), with\na 0.1\u20132.4 keV flux of 3.1\u00b10.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the observed frame and corrected\nfor the Galactic absorption (NHG = 1.45 1021 cm\u22122 , (Dickey & Lockman 1990). 2MASX\nJ0324+3410 has been monitored by the All Sky Monitor (ASM) on-board Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer (RXTE) since June 1996. The average ASM count rate over the last ten years is\n0.0343\u00b10.0065 cts s \u22121 , converting to a 2\u201310 keV flux of FX = 9.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nThe most recent X-ray observation was done by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) in July\n2006. The spectrum in the 0.3-10 keV band can be well fitted with a power-law of a photon\nindex 2.02\u00b10.06 with Galactic absorption. X-ray flux variations up to a factor of two on\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ntime-scales less than 1 ks have been detected in the Swift data. The average flux in the\n0.2\u20132.4 keV band was 3 times brighter than that measured in the RASS. Detailed analysis of\nthe X-ray data-sets will be presented in a future paper (Yuan W. et al. in preparation). Of\nparticular interest, a TeV flare was claimed to be marginally detected at a significance level\nof \u223c 2.5 \u2212 3.3 \u03c3 on October 10, 2001 with the Whipple imaging air Cerenkov telescope at the\nWhipple Observatory (Falcone et al. 2004). The average \u03b3-ray count rate was 0.46 \u00b1 0.14\ntimes that of the Crab, with a peak rate 0.62 \u00b1 0.19 Crab.\nThe broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) for the nucleus of 2MASX J0324+3410\nis plotted in Figure 2, using the results of our own data as well as data collected through the\nHEASARC web browser. For comparison, the SED for IZw 1 and Mrk 421-a well known\nNLS1 and blazar, respectively\u2013are over-plotted. It can be seen that 2MASX J0324+3410\nresembles Mrk 421 in terms of the broad band, non-thermal continuum in the radio and possibly X-ray bands, whereas it resembles IZw 1 in the infrared\u2013optical regime where thermal\nemission is dominant.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe host galaxy - a one-armed spiral?\n\nTwo snapshot images of 2MASX J0324+3410, each of 200 s exposure, were taken with\nthe second Wide Field and Planetary Camera (HST/WFPC2) of the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) with the F702W filter (\u03bbef f = 6919 \u00c5). The data were retrieved from the HST\narchive. The two exposures were combined to create a single image with a better S/N ratio.\n\u2032\u2032\nA ring-like structure of \u223c 15 diameter can be clearly seen, which corresponds to \u223c 15.6 kpc\nat redshift 0.0629. A nuclear source with high surface brightness is apparently displaced\nfrom the symmetric center of the host galaxy. Thanks to the superb spatial resolution of\n\u2032\u2032\n. 0 .1 of HST, we were able to extract the surface brightness profile of the galaxy and\ndecompose it into two components: an unresolved point-like source as the NLS1 nucleus,\nand a S\u00e9rsic model for the host galaxy (detailed analysis is to be presented in a later paper).\nWe find mN LS1,F 702 = 15.15 mag for the active nucleus, and mbulge,F 702 = 15.22 mag for\nthe host galaxy. After correcting for the Galactic extinction E(B-V)=0.213 Mag we get\nmN LS1,F 702 \u2248 14.70 mag. The residual looks like a one-armed spiral (see Fig 1b).\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion: a NLS1\u2013blazar composite\n\nThe spectral and temporal properties of 2MASX J0324+3410 in the radio and X-ray\nbands, as presented in Sect. 2.2, are characteristic of blazars: a flat radio spectrum and flux\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nvariability, a compact and bright radio core on milli-arcsec scale, hard X-ray emission and\nflares, short timescale variations in X-rays, and a broad band, non-thermal continuum. In\nparticular, its SED and possible TeV \u03b3-ray emission resemble those of a high-energy peaked\nblazar (HBL). On the other hand, its optical properties fulfill all criteria for classification\nas NLS1. These observational facts thus make 2MASX J0324+3410 a composite of a NLS1\nand a blazar. We note that the rest frame H\u03b2 equivalent width EW (H\u03b2) = 58 \u00b1 4\u00c5 is only\nslightly below the median value (\u22cd 80 \u00c5) for a large sample of NLS1s (Zhou et al. 2006),\ni.e. the contribution from a potential non-thermal continuum is small in the optical. If the\nX-ray to optical spectral slope is similar to that of I ZW 1 for the NLS1 component, the\nNLS1 accounts for only \u223c1/3 of the observed X-ray emission, which also has a flat spectrum\ncompared with other NLS1s. Its radio and most likely X-ray radiation can be naturally\nexplained as being from a jet (via synchrotron emission), while the infrared and optical light\nis dominated by thermal emission from a Seyfert nucleus.\nWe estimate the central black hole (BH) mass using a few methods. Using the width\nand luminosity of the H\u03b2 line and the empirical scaling relations as in Greene & Ho (2005),\nwe find a BH mass of 107 M\u2299 . While the empirical relations of Vestergaard & Peterson (2006)\ngive BH masses of 3\u00d7107 M\u2299 using the continuum luminosity at 5100\u00c5and 1.8\u00d7107 M\u2299 using\nthe H\u03b2 luminosity. These BH mass estimates2 are consistent within their uncertainties,\ngiving MBH \u223c 107 M\u2299 . Interestingly, this value falls into the overlapping region in the BH\nmass distributions for NLS1s and blazars, which have the bulk lying within 106\u22127 M\u2299 (e.g.,\nWang & Lu 2001; Grupe & Mathur 2004; Zhou et al. 2006) and 107\u22129 M\u2299 (e.g., Woo et al.\n2005, Falomo et al. 2002), respectively.\nWe estimate the bolometric luminosity from the 5100\u00c5luminosity using the correction\nfactor for quasars given by Elvis et al. (1994). This gives Lbol \u2248 1.2 1045 erg s\u22121 . We\nthus obtain a rough estimate of the Eddington ratio \u1e41 \u2261 Lbol /LEdd \u2248 0.1 for 2MASX\nJ0324+3410. The Eddington ratio is typical of NLS1s, and resembles FSRQ as far as its\nblazar property is concerned; however, the SED of its jet emission is more like HBLs, which\nhave, on the contrary, generally low accretion rates. The one-armed spiral may provide such\nfueling to the active nucleus, though it cannot be completely ruled out that the HST image\nwe see is a structure made up by dust lanes or even a ring galaxy.\n2MASX J0324+3410 is not unique, but is the most representative object of its kind,\nwhich seem to be rare. The optical spectrum of the BL Lac object 0846+51W1 showed\ntypical NLS1 characteristics at low states (Zhou et al. 2005). The radio-to-optical SED\n2\n\nWe note that a higher black hole mass of 8 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 is estimated if one uses the line dispersion instead\nof the FWHM, following Collin et al. (2006).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nof the radio loud NLS1 J094857.3+002225, for which beaming is required to explain the\nhigh brightness temperature, is also similar to that of 2MASX J0324+3410 (Zhou et al.\n2004; also Doi et al. 2006). A third example is RXJ 16290+4007 (Zhou & Wang 2002; also\nKomossa et al. 2006b), a flat-spectrum radio quasar with NLS1 characteristics in the optical.\nFurthermore, 8 out of the 9 very-radio-loud (VRL, R1.4 \u2261 f1.4GHz /fB & 250) NLS1s currently\nunder study (Zhou et al. 2006b in preparation) show flat radio spectra: 3 , \u03b11.4\u22125GHz . 0.5,\nf\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 , which is remarkable. Thus, it is probably true that most VRL NLS1s are actually\nradio intermediate (RI) NLS1s with boosted jet emission (Zhou et al. 2006b). If so, they\nare similar to a population of boosted RI quasars recently identified by Wang et al (2006)\nfrom their high radio brightness temperature, but with more extreme optical properties.\nThey may be an analog to the radio-bright, very high soft states in black hole binaries (e.g.,\nFender, Belloni & Gallo 2004).\nThe hybrid state of 2MASX J0324+3410 raises questions to the current understanding\nof TeV/high-energy peaked blazars. It is widely accepted that this type of blazar have very\nlow accretion rates, but 2MASX J0324+3410 is doubtlessly an exception. A common notion\nis that the intensive radiation field of the accretion disk prevents electrons from gaining the\nhigh energies that are required for TeV \u03b3-ray production or the formation of high frequency\nsynchrotron peaks in the SED. This is certainly not the case for 2MASX J0324+3410.\nWe thank Jianyan Wei and Jing Wang for help in our spectroscopic observations, and\nDirk Grupe and Binbin Zhang in the analysis of the swift data.
