Observational features are briefly discussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrediction of antimatter by Dirac 1 (1928) and quick subsequent discovery of the first antimatter\nparticle, positron, by Anderson 2 (1933) are among greatest scientific achievements of XX century. Discovery of antiproton 22 years later 3 was the next step which had opened a whole new\nworld of antiparticles. Now for (almost) every elementary particle a corresponding antiparticle\nhas also been observed. The latter have opposite signs of all associated charges and, according\nto CPT theorem4 , the same masses and, if unstable, life-times. Such symmetry between particles and antiparticles naturally leads to suggestion that the universe as a whole may be also\nsymmetric with respect to transformation from particles to antiparticles and there should exist\nastronomically large regions consisting of antimatter: anti-stars, clouds of diffuse antimatter,\nwhole anti-galaxies, or even large clusters of anti-galaxies. As Dirac 5 said in his Nobel lecture a :\n\"... we must regard it rather as an accident that the Earth (and presumably the whole solar\nsystem), contains a preponderance of negative electrons and positive protons. It is quite possible\nthat for some of the stars it is the other way about, these stars being built up mainly of positrons\nand negative protons. In fact, there may be half the stars of each kind.\"\nIn reality, at least in our neighborhood, the picture is different. One sees that the nearest\npart of the universe is strongly matter dominated. Our Galaxy is definitely made of matter\na\n\nI have found this quotation in the recent review 6 on experimental search for cosmic antimatter\n\n\fand only a minor fraction of antimatter is allowed by astronomical observation. In the case of\ndistant galaxies, either colliding or situated in a common cloud of intergalactic gas, an absence of\nproton-antiproton annihilation features makes one to conclude that these objects are made of the\nsame form of matter (or antimatter). So the simplest conclusion is that all the universe consists\nof matter only and there is no cosmologically significant antimatter, despite CPT-symmetry\nbetween particles and antiparticles. The mechanism that explained the observed picture and\ncould lead to 100% baryonic universe (possibly without any antimatter) was proposed in 1967\nby Sakharov 7 .\nStill there persists the question, if there may exist astronomically large domains or objects\nof antimatter? Where are they? How much antimatter are in the universe? These problems\npresent an interesting and important challenge to astronomy of XXI century and to cosmology\nof the early universe.\nUp to the present day no traces of cosmological antimatter have been seen. A small amount\nof antiprotons and positrons observed in cosmic rays may be explained by their secondary origin\nin collisions of energetic cosmic particles or in catastrophic stellar processes. Not a single, antinuclei, even as light as anti-deuterium, has ever been registered. According to the analysis of\nthe data on gamma-ray background with energy around 100 MeV, made in the review 8 , the\nnearest anti-galaxy should be away at least at 10 Mpc:\nlB > 10 Mpc\n\n(1)\n\nA much stronger limit was obtained relatively recently by Cohen, De Rujula, and Glashow 9 who\nconcluded that the nearest part of the universe dominated by antimatter should be at least at\nGigaparsec distance scale. The result was obtained for baryo-symmetric universe (equal amount\nof matter and antimatter) and for the so called adiabatic density perturbations. Lifting these\nconstraints may allow to weaken this very restrictive limit (see discussion below).\nDespite these bounds, an existence of astronomically large objects of antimatter (gas clouds,\nanti-stars, antigalaxies,...) is not excluded and even theoretically natural. They may be as close\nas halo of the Galaxy and rich of heavy anti-nuclei, e.g. C\u0304, N\u0304 , \u014c, ... and maybe F\u0304 e. It is\nevidently very interesting to look for such anti-objects. Their discovery would lead to better\nunderstanding of the nature of C and CP violation in cosmology, would allow to get an insight\ninto mechanisms of baryonic charge non-conservation, and may give another proof (or evidence)\nof inflation.\n2\n\nThe problems to think about\n\nThe excess of baryons over antibaryons is usually presented as the dimensionless ratio:\n\u03b2=\n\nNB \u2212 NB\u0304\n\u2248 6 * 10\u221210\nN\u03b3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere NB,B\u0304,\u03b3 are the cosmological number densities of baryons, antibaryons, and photons in\ncosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). The last number is precisely determined from\ndirect observations, N\u03b3 = 410/cm3 , while the baryon number density is independently found\nfrom big bang nucleosynthesis (see e.g. 10 ) and from relative positions and heights of acoustic\npeaks in angular spectrum of CMBR (see e.g. 11 ).\nAt the present day NB\u0304 \u226a NB , but in the early universe when the temperature was above\nQCD phase transition, T > 100 MeV, number of baryons was very close to the number of the\nantibaryons, NB\u0304 = NB (1 \u2212 \u03b2). The quantity \u03b2 is often called baryon asymmetry of the universe.\nThere are a few \"five-star\" questions to be addressed in connection with baryon asymmetry:\n1. Is \u03b2 = const or it may change in different space points, i.e. baryon asymmetry may be\ninhomogeneous?\n\n\f2. Is \u03b2 > 0 and the universe is dominated by matter everywhere or somewhere \u03b2 < 0 and\nthere are regions of antimatter?\n3. Is total baryonic charge of the universe:\nBtot =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2 dV\n\n(3)\n\npositive, negative, or exactly zero? The last case is particularly appealing because it means\nthat the universe is globally charge symmetric, while locally and at a very large scale it is\nstrongly asymmetric.\n4. If baryon asymmetry is not homogeneous, i.e. \u03b2 = \u03b2(x), then what is the characteristic\nscale of its variation, lB ?\n5. What kind of anti-objects may exist?\nData possible exclude Btot = 0 inside horizon, lhor \u223c 3 Gpc, as was mentioned above, but\nall other questions remain unanswered.\n3\n\nPrinciples of baryogenesis\n\nThe idea of dynamical generation of baryon asymmetry of the universe based on possible nonconservation of baryon number was pioneered by Sakharov 7 . Two years later another suggestion\nwas put forward by Omn\u00e9s 12 that the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry is only local\nand that it was created by spatial separation of baryons and antibaryons on astronomically large\nscales. It can be realized if baryons are conserved. However it seems impossible to create such\nseparation and the Omn\u00e9s idea is abandoned now. Maybe it may revive in a modified form if one\nfinds a mechanism for spatial separation of baryons and antibaryons along orthogonal direction\nto our 3-dimensional space, into higher dimensions, but at the moment it looks too far-fetched.\nAccording to Sakharov three basic principles of baryogenesis are the following:\n1. Non-conservation of baryons.\nIt was the weakest point in 1967 when the common belief was that baryons are conserved:\n\"we exist, hence protons must be stable\". Since that time our understanding became\nopposite: \"we exist, hence protons must be unstable\", because most probably the universe\nsuitable for life could not be created if baryonic charge is conserved. Present day theory has\na favorable attitude to non-conservation of baryons: both electroweak theory and grand\nunification ones predict that baryonic charge is not conserved.\n2. Violation of charge symmetry, both C and CP.\nBoth C and CP breakings are well established in experiment and though the concrete mechanism of CP-breaking is unknown it can be easily implemented into theory by introducing\ncomplex mass matrices of particles or complex Yukawa coupling constants.\n3. Deviation from thermal equilibrium.\nIn thermal equilibrium occupation number in phase space is given by Bose or Fermi (depending on particle spin) distribution functions:\n\u0010\n\nf = 1 \u00b1 eE/T\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n(4)\n\nwhere E is the particle energy and T is the temperature. Chemical potentials must vanish\nin equilibrium if the corresponding charge is not conserved. Due to CPT-theorem the\nmasses of particles and antiparticles are equal and thus for equal values of particle momenta\n\n\ftheir energies must be equal too. Correspondingly f = f \u0304 and in thermal equilibrium\nnumbers of particles and antiparticles must be the same. If CPT is broken then charge\nasymmetry may appear even in thermal equilibrium 13 .\nHowever breaking of CPT is not necessary because the universe is non-stationary, it expands and for massive particles some deviations from equilibrium are always present. Also\na noticeable breaking of thermal equilibrium could arise as a result of possible first order\nphase transitions in the primeval cosmic plasma in the process of expansion and cooling\ndown.\nThus all necessary conditions for baryogenesis are naturally fulfilled and one may expect that\nsome asymmetry between particles and antiparticles should be created in the universe. Moreover,\nnone of three formulated above conditions are obligatory and in some (possibly rather exotic)\nmodels cosmological baryon asymmetry might be generated even in thermal equilibrium, or with\nconserved baryonic charge in particle physics, or in CP-invariant particle theory - examples of\nsuch scenarios are given below.\n4\n\nMechanisms of CP-breaking in cosmology\n\nThere are three possible ways of breaking symmetry between particles and antiparticles in cosmology. One is a standard explicit mechanism when CP-breaking is achieved by complex constants in the Lagrangian. In this case baryon asymmetry in the universe would be directly\nrelated to CP-violating processes in elementary particle physics. Baryon asymmetry in this case\nwould be the same homogeneous one over all the universe, \u03b2 = const.\nAnother mechanism is spontaneous CP-breaking, proposed by T.D. Lee 14 . It can be achieved\nby vacuum condensate of a complex scalar field, h\u03c6i, which introduces complex constants into\nLagrangian over the vacuum state with a certain non-zero value of h\u03c6i. For example, the Yukawa\ninteraction term g\u03c6\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 gives rise to the complex mass term m\u03c8 = gh\u03c6i. One needs, of course,\nseveral different terms with \u03c6 in the Lagrangian so that the phase of h\u03c6i could not be rotated\naway by redefinition of the fields.\nAlso in this case CP-violation observed in particle physics can be related to the cosmological\ncharge asymmetry but now \u03b2 cannot be spatially constant. Spontaneous breaking of a discrete\nsymmetry (as e.g. CP) would give rise to domain structure of the universe with a different\nsigns of h\u03c6i in different domains. This might lead to cosmological disaster, as was shown by\nKobzarev, Okun and Zeldovich 15 . The problem is that domains with different sings of CPbreaking amplitude h\u03c6i must be separated by domain walls with a huge surface energy density\nand even a single domain wall per horizon would destroy the observed isotropy of the universe.\nIf there are too much walls per horizon the universe would be over-closed. To solve the domain\nwall problems one should either invent a mechanism enlarging the size of the domains beyond\nthe present day cosmological horizon or to destroy the walls at an early stage of cosmological\nevolution.\nEvidently in the domains with different signs of h\u03c6i the sign of CP-violation would be\ndifferent and correspondingly either an excess of matter over antimatter would be created or,\nanother way around, antimatter over matter 15,16 . With such mechanism of CP-breaking the\nuniverse would be globally charge symmetric, Btot = 0. However in a simple version of the model\nthe size of the domains should be much smaller than galactic size in evident contradiction with\nthe data. A way out was suggested by K. Sato 17 who assumed that there could be a moderate\nexponential expansion to inflate the domains to astronomically interesting scales. However, the\nproblem of domain wall still has to be solved. Even if the walls are eliminated by one or other\nmechanism, matter and antimatter remain in close contact and according to the arguments of\nref. 9 the nearest antimatter region should be practically at the horizon distance, around Gpc.\n\n\fThere could be another mechanism of CP-violation which operated only in the early universe\nand is absent in the particle physics. This mechanism may be called stochastic breaking of charge\nsymmetry 18 . In a sense it is similar to spontaneous one but does not suffer from the domain wall\nproblems and not necessary leads to globally charge symmetric universe. Such mechanism could\nbe realized if a complex scalar field did not relax down to its equilibrium value at some stage of\ncosmological evolution. It maybe be a result of a phase transition or of infrared instability of light\nscalars in De Sitter (inflationary) stage 19 . If such a field remains non-zero during baryogenesis\nits amplitude would give rise to CP-breaking in particle interactions, while later it would relax\ndown to zero and would not contribute to CP-breaking. Since we know that CP is broken in\nparticle physics, then both stochastic and explicit mechanisms might operate at baryogenesis.\n5\n\nModels of Baryogenesis\n\nI will briefly describe below possible models of baryogenesis that exist in the literature. More\ndetailed discussion can be found e.g. in the review papers 18,20 .\n5.1\n\nGUT-baryogenesis or heavy particle decays\n\nThis is historically first model of baryogenesis, it was practically proposed in the pioneering\npaper 7 and renewed interest to it was stimulated by the paper 21 a decade later. According to\nGrand Unified Theories (GUT) 22 there exist superheavy gauge of Higgs bosons whose decay do\nnot conserve baryonic charge. For example such bosons can decay into the channels X \u2192 qq or\nX \u2192 q\u0304l, where q is a quark and l is a lepton. Due to possible CP-nonconservation the decay\nbranchings B(X \u2192 qq) and B(X\u0304 \u2192 q\u0304 q\u0304) could be different and in out-of-equilibrium situation\nsuch decays would produce an excess of baryons over antibaryons (or vice versa - the sign of CP\nbreaking at GUT scale is unknown).\nThe deviation from equilibrium is determined by the ratio of the universe expansion rate,\nwhen the temperature was close to X-bosom mass, mX , to the decay width of X-bosons:\n\u01eb=\n\nmX\nmX\nH(T = mX )\n\u2248\n\u2248 17\n\u0393X\n\u03b1 mP l\n10 GeV\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u223c 10\u22122 is the gauge coupling constant. Thus, if X-bosons are as heavy as 1016 GeV,\nas we believe now, the deviation from equilibrium could be quite large to produce significant\nbaryon asymmetry even with entropy dilution by approximately two orders of magnitude in the\ncourse of cosmological cooling down from 1016 GeV to the present state.\nIn simple versions such mechanism naturally gives \u03b2 = const and no antimatter. A problem\nwith its realization is that probably the universe was never at very high temperatures about\n1016 GeV, since normally after inflation the universe was heated to much lower temperature.\n5.2\n\nElectro-weak baryogenesis\n\nIt was suggested by Kuz'min, Rubakov, and Shaposhnikov 23 that baryon asymmetry might be\ngenerated at much lower temperatures, \u223cTeV, by the usual electro-weak interactions. Indeed,\nall the necessary ingredients are present in the standard low energy physics. It is known that\nCP is broken, baryonic charge is non-conserved due to quantum chiral anomaly 24 , and thermal\nequilibrium would be broken if the electro-weak phase transition is first order. It is evident from\neq. (5) that deviation from equilibrium due to non-zero masses of W and Z bosons is negligibly\nsmall. Generation of baryon asymmetry in this model takes place not in massive particle decays\nbut on the boundary between two phases with unbroken and broken SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)-symmetry of\nweak interactions respectively. In the high temperature phase, where the symmetry is unbroken,\nsphaleron 25 transitions, which break baryon conservation, are believed to be very active, so\n\n\fequilibrium with respect to B-nonconserving processes is quickly established. To be more exact,\nanomalous electroweak interactions conserve the difference between leptonic and baryonic charge,\n(B \u2212 L), while (B + L) is non-conserved. So (B \u2212 L) remains constant in comoving volume\nand equal to its initial value, while non-conserved (B + L) may evolve. In low temperature\nphase the baryonic charge is practically conserved but if the phase transition was first order and\nphases coexisted, in the boundary between them both baryon non-conservation and deviation\nfrom equilibrium could be strong enough to generate the observed asymmetry.\nHowever, as we now know from the LEP data (see e.g. 26 ), the lower limit on the Higgs boson\nmass is higher than 100 GeV and this makes first order phase transition quite problematic.\nThere exist many modifications of the minimal scenario of electroweak baryogenesis but the\nmodel became much less popular now. For review one can see refs. 20,27 ; a discussion of the\nlatest development and an impressive list of references can be found in the recent papers 28 .\nNormally electroweak models do not lead to creation of antimatter domains in the universe\nbut with a simple modification they could do that.\n5.3\n\nBaryo-thru-lepto-genesis\n\nThis mechanism presents a combination of the two discussed above (subsections 5.1 and 5.2)\nand was proposed by Fukugita and Yanagida 29 . Initially lepton asymmetry, Lin , was generated by decays of heavy Majorana neutrino, \u03bdM , and later this asymmetry was redistributed\nbetween baryonic and leptonic ones by electro-weak interactions at equilibrium stage due to\nnon-conservation of (B + L). Final baryon asymmetry would be roughly equal to Lin /2 (the\nexact value of the coefficient depends upon the particle content of the theory 30,18 ). This scenario\nis very popular now, one can find detailed discussion of different versions and a list of references\nin the reviews 31 .\nLepton asymmetry generated by the decays of \u03bdM can be roughly estimated as:\nL = \u01ebM\n\nN\u03bdM \u2206\u0393\nNtot \u0393\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01ebM = m\u03bdM /(\u03b1M mP l is the parameter characterizing deviation from thermal equilibrium\n(5), Na are number densities of the corresponding particles, \u0393 \u223c \u03b1M m\u03bdM is the total decay width\nof \u03bdM , and \u2206\u0393 \u223c \u03b12M m\u03bdM \u03b4 is the difference of lepton non-conserving decay rates of \u03bdM into\ncharge conjugated channels with \u03b4 being the amplitude of CP-breaking. With m\u03bdM \u223c 1010 GeV\nthe lepton asymmetry seems to be too small but experts in the field are more optimistic and\naccording to majority of the works on the subject, the discussed mechanism may successfully\ngenerate observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.\nRecently a modification of \"lepto-thru-baryo\" scenario was proposed in ref. 32 . It was suggested that (B + L)-asymmetry was generated at GUT scale by heavy particle decays, while\n(B \u2212 L) remained zero since it is conserved in simple models of grand unification. Lepton asymmetry was washed out in equilibrium reactions with Majorana neutrino at a later stage and\nremaining baryon asymmetry cannot be completely destroyed by sphaleron processes since they\nconserve (B \u2212 L).\nAll these models are not particularly good for creation of cosmic antimatter but one can\neasily modify them to this end by introducing e.g. stochastic CP-violation (see sec. 4). Still it\nlooks rather unnatural.\n5.4\n\nBlack hole evaporation\n\nCosmological baryon asymmetry might be created by the evaporation of primordial black holes\nwith low mass 33,34,35 . A concrete mechanism was suggested in the paper 35 and the calculations of\nthe effect were performed in ref. 36 . This mechanism does not demand direct non-conservation\n\n\fof baryonic charge in particle physics. On the other hand, according to estimates made by\nZeldovich 35 proton may decay through formation of virtual black hole with life-time about\nm4P l /m5p \u223c 1052 sec. If this estimate is correct then in the high dimensional models with TeVscale gravity 39 the proton life-time would be catastrophically short, \u223c 10\u22128 sec. A lower bound\non quantum gravity scale based on the analysis of proton decay through formation of virtual\nblack holes has been recently done in the paper 37 .\nIn the process of evaporation black hole emits all kind of particles with the mass smaller than\nblack hole temperature, TBH = m2P l /(8\u03c0MBH ). A massive meson, still in gravitational field of\nblack hole, could decay into a light baryon and a heavy antibaryon (e.g. u and t\u0304 quarks) or vice\nversa. The decay probabilities may be different because of C(CP) violation. Since back capture\nof heavy particles by the black hole is more probable then that of light ones, such process could\ncreate a net flux of baryonic charge into external space, while equal anti-baryonic charge would\nbe hidden inside disappearing black hole. This mechanism could explain the observed value\nof the baryon asymmetry of the universe if at some early stage the total cosmological energy\ndensity was dominated by those black holes 36,38 .\nWithout special efforts this model is also inefficient for creation of cosmologically significant\namount of antimatter.\n5.5\n\nSpontaneous baryogenesis\n\nThe mechanism was proposed by Cohen and Kaplan 40 and is based on the assumption that\nthere exists a U (1)-symmetry, related to baryonic or some other non-orthogonal charge, which\nis spontaneously broken. A toy-model Lagrangian can be written as:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nL = \u2212|\u2202\u03c6|2 + \u03bb |\u03c6|2 \u2212 f 2 +\n\nX\na\n\n\u03c8\u0304a (i\u2202/ + ma ) \u03c8 +\n\nX\na,b\n\n\u0001\n\ngab \u03c6\u03c8\u0304b \u03c8a + h.c.\n\n(7)\n\nwhere some fermionic fields \u03c8b possess non-zero baryonic charge, while some other do not. The\ntheory is invariant with respect to simultaneous phase rotation:\n\u03c6 \u2190 \u03c6 exp(i\u03b8) and \u03c8b \u2192 \u03c8b exp(i\u03b8)\n\n(8)\n\nwhich ensures conservation of \"baryonic\" charge. In the broken symmetry phase where |\u03c6| = f\nthe conservation of baryonic current of fermions also breaks down (due to presence of the last\nterm in the Lagrangian above) and the Lagrangian takes the form:\nL = \u2212f 2 (\u2202\u03b8)2 + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 \u03c8\u0304b \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8b + ...\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the massless Goldstone field induced by the breaking of the global Ub -symmetry. If\nthere are some additional terms in the Lagrangian producing an explicit symmetry breaking\nthen \u03b8 would be massive and is called pseudo-Goldstone field. Baryogenesis would be much\nmore efficient in the latter case.\nIn the homogeneous case when \u03b8 = \u03b8(t) the second term in expression (9) looks like \u03b8\u0307nb\nwhere nb is the baryonic charge density. So it is tempting to identify \u03b8\u0307 with chemical potential\nof baryons 40 . Though it is not exactly so 41 , still this term shifts equality between number\ndensities of quarks and anti-quarks even in thermal equilibrium, allowing baryogenesis without\ndeviation from thermal equilibrium. In a sense this mechanism is equivalent to breaking of CPT\nbecause the process goes in time dependent background.\nThe sign of the created baryon asymmetry is determined by the sign of the \u03b8\u0307 and could be\nboth positive or negative producing baryons or antibaryons. To create the matter/antimatter\ndomain of astronomically large size the U (1)-symmetry should be broken during inflation and in\nthis case the sign of \u03b8\u0307 would be determined by the chaotic quantum fluctuations at inflationary\nstage. The analysis of density perturbations created by the fluctuating field \u03b8 was done in ref. 42 .\n\n\fIn this scenario C(CP)-violation is not necessary for generation of baryon asymmetry. As\na whole the universe could be charge symmetric. We know however that an explicit C(CP)violation is also present. If it also participates in creation of baryon asymmetry, then the\namount of matter and antimatter in the universe would be unequal with unknown ratio that\nshould be determined from observations.\n5.6\n\nSUSY condensate baryogenesis\n\nAll known baryons are fermions but if there is supersymmetry then scalar superpartners of\nbaryons should exist. Such scalar fields might form a condensate in the early universe and\naccumulate a large baryonic charge. A very efficient scenario of baryogenesis based on this\nobservation was proposed by Affleck and Dine 43 . In many supersymmetric models self-potential\nof scalar fields has so called flat directions along which it does not rise. As a toy model we can\nconsider the potential of the form:\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ni\n\nU (\u03c7) = \u03bb |\u03c7|4 \u2212 \u03c74 + \u03c7\u22174 /2 = \u03bb|\u03c7|4 (1 \u2212 4 cos \u03b8)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = |\u03c7| exp(i\u03b8). This potential has four valleys \u03b8 = \u03c0n/2 with n = 0, 1, 2, 3 and is not\ninvariant with respect to rotation in two-dimensional (Re\u03c7, Im\u03c7)-plane. This leads to nonconservation of baryonic current of \u03c7. The latter is defined as\nJ\u03bcB (\u03c7) = (\u2212i/2) (\u03c7\u2217 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\u2217 \u03c7) = \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 |\u03c7|2\n\n(11)\n\nInitially the field \u03c7 could be far away from the origin along one of the valleys, either by unspecified\ninitial conditions or due to rising quantum fluctuations at inflationary stage 19 , which lead to\nh\u03c72 i = H 3 t/2\u03c0. When inflation is over and due to some symmetry breaking, \u03c7 acquires mass,\nit starts to move down to the origin with baryonic charge accumulated in its angular motion,\nB\u03c7 = \u03b8\u0307 |\u03c7|4 . There is a convenient mechanical analogy in the case of homogeneous \u03c7 = \u03c7(t). Its\nequation of motion\n\u03c7\u0308 + 3H \u03c7\u0307 + U \u2032 (\u03c7) = 0\n\n(12)\n\ndescribes classical mechanical motion of a point-like particle in the potential U (\u03c7). The second\nterm, induced by the cosmological expansion, presents liquid friction force. In this language\nthe baryonic charge of \u03c7 is simply angular momentum of the particle in this potential. If the\npotential is spherically symmetric (in two dimensions: [Re\u03c7, Im\u03c7] ) then baryonic charge is\nconserved, otherwise not.\nWhen \u03c7 approaches zero it decays into quarks and transfers baryonic charge of its angular\nmotion to baryonic charge of quarks. The sign of the asymmetry depends upon the direction\nof the rotation. The latter may be determined by chaotic initial fluctuations in the directions\northogonal the the valley, in this case CP-violation is unnecessary, or by explicit CP-breaking\nterms in the potential, e.g.\nU (\u03c7) = \u03bb|\u03c7|4 (1 \u2212 cos 4\u03b8) + m2 |\u03c7|2 [1 \u2212 cos (2\u03b8 + 2\u03b3)]\n\n(13)\n\nwhere a non-zero phase \u03b3 induces explicit CP-violation.\nIf \u03c7 condensed along the valley with \u03b8 = 0 it would start rotating clock-wise when it\napproaches zero and starts to feel mass valley (for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03c0/2). If \u03c7 \"lived\" in \u03c0/2-valley it\nwould start rotating anti-clock-wise. Thus, depending upon initial position of \u03c7, both baryons\nand antibaryons may be created with the same sign of CP-violating phase \u03b3. In this model\nthe universe most probably would be globally charge asymmetric because the magnitude of\nthe angular momentum depends upon the relative angles between \u03c74 and \u03c72 valleys. The size\n\n\fof baryonic and anti-baryonic domains are expected to be very large, maybe even larger than\nhorizon, because the regions of initial values of \u03c7 in different valleys could be strongly separated\nduring inflation.\nOn the other hand, if all the observed part of the universe originated from the same \u03c7\nvalley the size of regions with definite sign of baryon asymmetry could be much smaller. Such\nsituation could be realized in the model with potential (13) with \u03b3 = 0, i.e. with conserved CP.\nIf \u03c7 evolves down along the valley with \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2, then for sufficiently small |\u03c7| this direction\nbecomes unstable and \u03c7 would go down to \u03b8 = 0 or \u03b8 = \u03c0 rotating either clock-wise or anti-clockwise. So in this model there would be equally probable baryonic and anti-baryonic domains.\nSlightly changing direction of mass valley, taking a non-zero \u03b3 would allow to create the universe\nwith arbitrary fraction of baryons with respect to antibaryons.\n6\n\nCreation of domains or objects of antimatter\n\nAs we have seen above, antimatter could be quite naturally created in the universe in astronomically interesting amount. Probably the most efficient mechanisms for creation of cosmic\nantimatter are spontaneous baryogenesis (sec. 5.5) and Affleck-Dine one (sec. 5.6). If the scalar\nbaryon of SUSY model is coupled to the inflaton field \u03a6 by the following general renormalizable\ncoupling\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nL = \u03bb\u03c72 + h.c. (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a61 )2\n\n(14)\n\na very interesting and unusual features in generation of baryon asymmetry may appear 44 .\nBecause of this interaction favorable conditions for baryogenesis might be created only for a\nshort time and correspondingly in relatively small fraction of space. As a result there would be\nseparate bubbles with very large baryon asymmetry, even of order unity which would be floating\nin the usual cosmological baryo-asymmetric background with \u03b2 = 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 . This baryon-rich\nbubbles would be with practically equal probability baryonic or anti-baryonic and many of them\nwould form primordial black holes and because of that would be indistinguishable. Some of them\nwould survive collapse and form disperse clouds of matter and antimatter with unusually high\nbaryonic number. Some of this objects may form unusual stars and anti-stars with a high initial\nfraction of heavy nuclei (or anti-nuclei). The mass distribution of (anti)baryon-rich regions,\naccording to ref. 44 , is\nM\ndN\n\u223c exp \u2212C ln2\ndM\nM1\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(15)\n\nwhere M1 is unknown mass parameter which could be a fraction of solar mass up to many solar\nmasses and C is a constant.\nIt is an interesting possibility that such primordially formed black holes constitute dark\nmatter in the universe. It would be a cold dark matter but, in contrast to the standard one,\nhaving a disperse mass distribution. With a small probability there could be even very heavy\nblack holes with the masses up to 106 \u2212 109 M\u2299 , where M\u2299 is the solar mass. Most of these\nblack holes might have mass near solar mass and could live in galactic halos. Their non-captured\natmospheres may be anti-baryonic and, if so, considerable amount of antimatter could be even\nin halo of the Galaxy. The model naturally predicts early formation of quasars and evolved\nchemistry in their atmospheres because in the (anti)baryon-rich regions primordial nucleosynthesis would not stop at 7 Li. Regions with a smaller \u03b2 might survive collapse and form either\nclouds of antimatter or anti-stars. Encounter of a star and anti-star could be a very spectacular\nphenomenon. More details about this model can be found in refs. 45 .\n\n\fStill a few comments about formation and properties of such antimatter black holes may\nworth making. They were formed when the density contrast inside horizon was of order unity,\n(\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1)hor \u223c 1. One can simply estimate this ratio as\nm p NB\n1 mp\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2248\n= \u03b2\n\u03c1\n3T N\u03b3\n3 T\n\n(16)\n\nwhere mp is the proton mass and T is the cosmological temperature. The mass inside horizon\nis given by:\nMhor\n\n8\u03c0\n(2t)3 \u03c1 = 5 * 104 M\u2299\n=\n3\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nsec\n\n\u0013\n\n(17)\n\nBlack holes formed in antibaryon rich regions could possess atmosphere of antimatter. Before\nhydrogen recombination diffusion is slow and the atmosphere might survive. Recombination in\nhigh |\u03b2| regions occurs earlier, at temperatures in eV range, instead of normal 0.1 eV. Hence\natmosphere would not be stripped by CMBR at the onset of structure formation. Annihilation\non the boundary could heat the plasma and create secondary ionization. All these phenomena\ndeserve more detailed investigation.\nAn efficient way to create cosmic antimatter in any model of baryogenesis is based on stochastic CP-breaking (sec. 4). If some complex scalar field was nonvanishing during baryogenesis then\neffective CP-breaking induced by this field would participate in creation of cosmological charge\nasymmetry and if the field changed sign as a function of space point the sign of asymmetry might\nalso be different. For example, if the field \u03c6(t, x) was a slowly varying function of x and its potential was not strictly harmonic, i.e. contained e.g. quartic terms, \u03bb\u03c64 , and since frequency of\noscillations in non-harmonic potential depends upon the amplitude, then smooth \u03c6(x, t) would\nturn into an oscillating (and quasi-periodic) function of space point. Depending upon the ratio\nbetween amplitudes of explicit and stochastic CP-violation astronomically interesting antimatter\ndomains might be formed 46 .\nDiscussion of some other models of antimatter creation, can be found in the papers 18,47 .\nThis subject is also actively discussed in this conference 48 .\n7\n\nBounds on existence of antimatter\n\nLet us first discuss the most stringent lower bound on the distance to antimatter domains in\nbaryo-symmetric cosmology found by Cohen, De Rujula, and Glashow 9 . Matter and antimatter\ncannot be separated by the distance, lB , larger than 20 Mpc (at the present day scale) because\nin the boundary region with deficit of both matter and antimatter density contrast would be\nincompatible with measurements of angular fluctuation of CMBR accessible at such scales. If\nlB < 20 Mpc diffusion of protons and antiprotons would bring them into contact and they would\nannihilate. Naively one would expect that the excessive pressure created by annihilation would\nforce matter and antimatter apart inhibiting the annihilation. However the picture is opposite.\nThe energetic products of annihilation have a large mean free path so they transfer their energy\n(and pressure) to the plasma far away and the excessive pressure pushes matter and antimatter\ntogether and enhances annihilation. Thus the CDRG 9 limit lB > (\u223c Gpc) was obtained. As it\nwas already mentioned it is valid in the case of baryo-symmetric cosmology when the universe is\nequally rich of baryons and antibaryons. If however, the fraction of antibaryons is much smaller\nthan that of baryons (or vice versa) the limit would be weaker, roughly by the same amount.\nAnother assumption made in the derivation of CDRG bound is adiabatic density perturbations, i.e. the same perturbations in all forms of matter. The limit may be invalid for\nisocurvature perturbations, when initially \u03b4\u03c1 = 0 but chemical content of plasma varies in different space points. Now let us consider three regions: one with baryonic excess, another with\n\n\fequal anti-baryonic excess and some boundary between them with no baryons. By assumption\nthe energy density of all three regions were initially the same. The plasma in baryonic and\nanti-baryonic regions would be less relativistic and thus, when the temperature drops, their\nenergy density would be higher than the energy density of the baryon-free part. On the other\nhand, nonrelativistic matter cools faster and the temperature of radiation in baryon free region\nwould be higher. Hence the pressure of photons would be higher and it may prevent baryons\nand antibaryons from close contact and annihilation. This mechanism may significantly relax\nCDRG bound, but accurate calculations are needed.\nMatter-antimatter annihilation on the domain boundaries might distort energy spectrum of\nCMBR if the annihilation takes place before recombination 49 . The effect would be noticeable\nfor large size domains. At the present time this phenomenon does not permit to obtain any\ninteresting limit.\nOf course an unambiguous proof of existence of cosmic antimatter would be an observation\nof anti-nuclei in cosmic rays, especially heavier than anti-deuterium because the latter might\nbe produced in secondary processes 50 with small but not vanishingly small probability. Some\nindication for antimatter could be anomalies in the spectrum of antiprotons in cosmic rays but\nthe data may have an ambiguous interpretation. Earlier works on search of cosmic antiprotons\nand their relation to cosmological antimatter can be found in refs. 51 . Program of search and\nexisting limits are discussed in many talks at this Conference, too many to mention them all,\nbut for reviews one can see refs. 6,52 .\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nSimplest models of baryogenesis predict charge asymmetric universe with Btot 6= 0. Normally,\nwithout additional assumptions, they do not lead to cosmological antimatter domains or astronomically large objects. On the other hand, they generally meet some problems with explanation\nof the observed value of baryon asymmetry, \u03b2.\nSpontaneous baryogenesis or Affleck-Dine scenario can successfully explain the observed\nasymmetry and naturally predict existence of astronomically interesting antimatter.\nIn a version of Affleck-Dine model with coupling between the scalar baryon and inflaton\nfields relatively small regions with very high \u03b2, both positive and negative, can be created. Such\nobjects would mostly form primordial black holes. They may be abundantly present even in\nhalo of our Galaxy. An interesting possibility is that they form all dark matter in the universe.\nAround such black holes heavy (anti)nuclei should be present and, though one cannot distinguish\nbetween black hole and anti-black-hole, anti-nuclei stripped from the neighborhood of the latter\nmay be registered. Thus one may hope to discover anti-nuclei in cosmic rays and not only 4 H\u0304e\nbut also (and quite probably more abundant) heavier anti-nuclei, C\u0304, N\u0304 , \u014c and maybe even F\u0304 e.\nOther models give less optimistic scenarios for possibility of registration of anti-nuclei. But\nthere are no iron-strong predictions and one should rely on future observations and detailed\ntheoretical calculations to make more definite conclusions. At the present day our knowledge\nis too scarce and one even cannot exclude that we live in antimatter dominated universe with\nminor domains of matter as e.g. our group of galaxies inside 10 Mpc.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nP.A.M.
