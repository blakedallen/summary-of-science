Recent measurement of Bs -B\u0304s mass difference,\n\u2206Ms = 17.77 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.07 ps\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nby D\u00d8 and CDF collaborations [2] can impact on the flavor structure of new physics beyond the standard model\n(SM) [3, 4]. The experimental constraints for new physics\nare not very severe yet since deviations from the SM prediction can be buried in the errors of CKM parameters\nand lattice calculation. In other words, there is still room\nfor new physics. However, the parameters are expected\nto be determined more accurately in the near future. Besides, the CP asymmetry of Bs decay can be observed by\ndirect measurements, and we will get important information of new physics.\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most promising\ncandidates of new physics. SUSY can provide a natural\nprospect to have a large hierarchy in the theories, and\nin the minimal SUSY standard model (MSSM), gauge\nforces can unify at a high scale, which leads to a successful realization of grand unified theories (GUTs). However, the flavor sector has not yet been well accepted in\nthe MSSM due to the fact that SUSY breaking terms\ncan induce large flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs). Actually, the experimental constraints of FCNCs\nintroduce flavor degeneracy of the SUSY particles, especially in first and second generations, if SUSY particles\nare lighter than around 2-3 TeV [5].\nIn order to suppress the SUSY FCNCs, the squarks\nand sleptons are assumed to be degenerate at the GUT\nscale as a nature of the SUSY breaking. Even though\nthe degeneracy is realized at a scale, the renormalization\ngroup equation (RGE) flow induces flavor violation for\nsquarks and sleptons at low energy. In this scenario,\nthe flavor violating effects in SUSY breaking terms are\nsmall at the weak scale and satisfy the current FCNC\nconstraints. The small flavor violations originate from\nmixings in the Yukawa couplings characterized by the\n\nCKM mixings as well as the neutrino mixings. In the\nMSSM, the induced FCNCs in the quark sector are not\nlarge since the CKM mixings are small. In the lepton\nsector, on the other hand, sizable FCNC effects can be\ngenerated and a testable amount of flavor violating lepton\ndecay can be obtained [6], which is related to the large\nmixings for the neutrino oscillations.\nIn the grand unified models, the flavor violation at the\nweak scale can be related to the GUT scale physics. Actually, as a consequence of the quark-lepton unification,\nthe large neutrino mixings not only introduces flavor violations in the lepton sector, but also in the quark sector\nas well. The relation of flavor violation in the quark and\nthe lepton sectors depends on unification of matters and\nhow to obtain light neutrino masses. Therefore, investigating the FCNC effects, we may obtain a footprint of\nthe GUT models.\nThe new result on Bs -B\u0304s mixing can restrict the flavor\nviolation in the quark sector involving b and s quarks. In\ngrand unified models, the Bs -B\u0304s oscillation can be correlated to the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 decay. Since Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) is being\nmeasured at the B factories, the future results will be\nable to probe new contributions from the GUT models.\nIn this letter, we calculate Bs -B\u0304s mixing and Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3)\nin SU(5) and SO(10) GUT models, and study the implication of the correlation between Bs -B\u0304s mixing and\nBr(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) decay in the CP asymmetry of Bs -B\u0304s mixing\n(which is under experimental investigation) to decipher\nGUT models.\nThe existence of second-third generation (23) mixing\nelements in squarks and slepton mass matrices generate\nBs mixing and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 decay respectively. We first investigate the arise of 23 elements in squark and slepton\nmass matrices in the grand unified theories.\nSU(5) model: In a SU(5) grand unified model, the\nsuperpotential involving the Yukawa \u221a\ncouplings is as follows: WY = Yu ij /4 10i 10j H5 + 2 Yd ij 10i 5\u0304j H\u03045\u0304 +\nY\u03bd ij 5\u0304i Nj H5 + M\u03bd ij /2 Ni Nj , where 5\u0304 contains the righthanded down-type quarks (Dc ) and left-handed lepton\ndoublets (L), and i, j denote the generation indices. The\nleft-handed quark doublets (Q), right-handed up-type\n\n\f2\nquarks (U c ), and right-handed charged-leptons (E c ) are\nunified in 10 multiplet, and N is the right-handed neutrino. Since two large neutrino mixings have been observed in nature, the Y\u03bd coupling is expected to have large\noff-diagonal elements, which will generate off-diagonal\nterms in the SUSY breaking scalar mass matrices for\nthe scalar 5\u0304 multiplet via H\u03045\u0304 and N loops [6]. One,\nthus, expects a large 23 element in the SUSY breaking\nscalar mass matrices for D\u0303c and L\u0303 due to the large atmospheric mixing and possibly large \u03bd\u03c4 Dirac Yukawa\ncoupling. Therefore, the SUSY contribution for the amplitude of Bs -B\u0304s mixing can be enhanced along with the\nbranching ratio of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3.\nSince our purpose is to investigate the flavor violation\nin the 23 sector of squark and sleptons and to probe how\nit relates the Bs -Bs mixing and flavor violating \u03c4 decay, we are only discussing the 23 element and its effects\nin quark and lepton flavor violation in this letter. For\nthis purpose, we consider the following simplified SU(5)\nboundary condition for the SUSY breaking scalar mass\nmatrices at the GUT scale where SU(5) is broken to the\nSM:\n2\n2\n= M\u01682 c = M\u1ebc2 c = m20 1,\nM10\n= MQ\u0303\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n2\n2\n\uf8ed 0 1 \u03b4 \uf8f8 m20 .\nM5\u03042 = MD\u0303\nc = ML\u0303 =\n0 \u03b4\u2217 1\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe \u03b4 denotes the flavor mixing term arising from the\nneutrino Yukawa couplings discussed above. We assume the above boundary condition in the basis where\nthe down-type quark Yukawa matrix is diagonal (at the\nT\nGUT scale): Yd = Yddiag , Yu = VCKM\nYudiag Pu VuR , Ye =\n\u2020\nVeL Yediag Pe VeR\n, where the up- and down-type quarks\ndiag\nand the charged-lepton Yukawa couplings Yu,d,e\nare real\n(positive) diagonal matrices and Pu,e are diagonal phase\nmatrices. In a minimal SU(5) GUT, in which only H5\nand H\u03045\u0304 couple to matter fields, we have VuR = VCKM ,\nVeL = VeR = 1, and Yddiag = Yediag . We do not assume\nthe minimal choice of Higgs fields, but assume VeL \u2243 1\nto keep the relation of flavor violation between the quark\nand the lepton sectors.\nWe note that one can also have first-second and firstthird generations mixings in squarks and sleptons. However, they can be small by the choice of 13 mixing in Y\u03bd\nand the hierarchical pattern of the neutrino coupling. If\nthese elements are large, \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 will become large.\nSO(10) model: In a SO(10) model, the flavor violations can be more enhanced compared to the SU(5)\ncase since all matters are unified in spinor representation and couple to 10 and 126 Higgs fields [7], e.g.,\nWY = 12 hij 16i 16j 10 + 12 fij 16i 16j 126. The mixings in\nthe neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling may be small since\nright-handed neutrinos are also unified with other quarks\nand leptons. In a SO(10) model, however, there could be\nsources for large flavor violations in Majorana couplings\n\nfor both left- and right-handed neutrinos in the type II\nseesaw scenario [8]. The Majorana couplings are unified\nto the 16 * 16 * 126 coupling, and also affect the quark\nfields. The couplings will give rise to observable amount\nof flavor violations to the sparticle mass matrices via the\nGUT particle loops. Based on the above discussions, the\nfollowing mass terms can arise in a SO(10) model at the\nGUT scale:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n2\nM16\n= \uf8ed 0 1 \u03b4 \uf8f8 m20 .\n(4)\n0 \u03b4\u2217 1\nWhen the matters couple to only 10 and 126\nHiggs fields, the Yukawa matrices are symmetric and\nthe boundary condition is Yd = Yddiag Pd , Yu =\nT\nVCKM\nYudiag Pu VCKM , Ye = Vql Yediag Pe VqlT . We do not assume the minimal choice of Higgs fields but assume\nVql \u2243 1. It needs to be noted that the diagonal phase matrices Pu,d,e can not be rotated away for this boundary\ncondition and these parameters enter into our calculations which we will see later.\nIt appears that in order to suppress the proton decay and to obtain the correct fit to fermion masses one\nneeds to extend the above minimal SO(10) model. The\nnew superpotential includes 120 Higgs field: WY =\n1\n1 \u2032\n1\n2 hij 16i 16j 10 + 2 fij 16i 16j 126 + 2 hij 16i 16j 120. In\nthis case, the symmetric nature of the Yukawa matrices is lost since 120 Higgs coupling h\u2032 is antisymmetric.\nIn this context, the Hermitian Yukawa matrices can be\nconsidered with 120 Higgs and a parity symmetry to reduce the number of parameters and to solve SUSY CP\nproblem [9]. The SO(10) symmetry is broken in the basis where Yd is diagonal, since the left- and right-handed\nfields are rotated by conjugated unitary matrices, e.g.\nQ \u2192 V Q and U c \u2192 V \u2217 U c . In the original SO(10) basis,\nthe SUSY breaking mass matrices are real by the parity\nsymmetry. As a result, in the basis where the down-type\nquark Yukawa matrix is diagonal, the squarks and slepton masses at the GUT scale are related by the following\nrelation\n2\n2\u2217\n2\n2\u2217\nMQ\u0303\n= M\u01682\u2217c = MD\u0303\nc = ML\u0303 = M\u1ebc c .\n\n(5)\n\nSo we see that two mass relations are possible in a SO(10)\nmodel at the GUT scale. We call one of them symmetric (since the Yukawa couplings are symmetric) and the\nother one hermitian (since the Yukawa couplings are hermitian).\nWe use the above mass matrices for the boundary condition at the GUT scale and then calculate the masses\nat the weak scale by using RGEs to calculate the mixing of Bs -B\u0304s and Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3). In calculating the mass\ndifferences of mesons, one encounters non-perturbative\nfactors originating from strong interaction. In the ratio\nof Bs and Bd mass differences, many common factors\ncancel, and the ratio can be calculated more accurately\n\n\f3\nrather than the respective mass differences. We have\n2\n\nCBs e2i\u03c6Bs\n\nM12 (Bs )\n,\n\u2261\nM12 (Bs )SM\n\n(7)\n\nwhere M12 (Bs ) = M12 (Bs )SM + M12 (Bs )SUSY denotes\nthe off-diagonal element of Bs -B\u0304s mass matrix. Superscript SM (SUSY) stands for SM (SUSY) contribution.\nThe mass difference is given as \u2206Ms = 2|M12 (Bs )|.\nWe now discuss the SUSY contributions in Bs -B\u0304s mixing. When the flavor degeneracy is assumed in the\nMSSM, the chargino diagram dominates the SUSY contributions of M12 (Bs,d ). In this case, \u03c6Bs \u2243 0 in Eq.(7),\nand the ratio of mass differences in the MSSM is almost\nsame as in the SM. In the general parameter space for the\nsoft SUSY breaking terms, the gluino box diagram dominates the SUSY contribution of M12 (Bs ). The gluino (g\u0303)\ncontribution can be written naively in the following mass\ninsertion form\ng\u0303\nM12\nd\nd\nd\nd\n\u2243 a [(\u03b4LL\n)232 + (\u03b4RR\n)232 ] \u2212 b (\u03b4LL\n)32 (\u03b4RR\n)32 , (8)\nSM\nM12\n\nwhere a and b depend on squark and gluino masses,\nd\nand \u03b4LL,RR\n= (Md\u03032 )LL,RR /m\u03032 (m\u0303 is an averaged squark\nmass). The matrix Md\u03032 is a down-type squark mass matrix (Q\u0303, D\u0303c\u2020 )Md2 \u0303(Q\u0303\u2020 , D\u0303c )T in the basis where down-type\nquark mass matrix is real (positive) diagonal. When\nsquark and gluino masses are less than 1 TeV, a \u223c O(1)\nand b \u223c O(100). We also have contributions from\nd\n\u03b4LR\n, but we neglect them since they are suppressed by\n(mb /mSUSY )2 . It is worth noting that the SO(10) boundary condition gives much larger SUSY contribution of\nM12 (Bs ) compared to the SU(5) case since both offdiagonal elements for LL and RR are large and b \u226b a in\nthe formula, Eq.(8).\nFor the calculation of observables at weak scale, we\nneed to use the basis where Yd,e are real (positive) diagonal matrix. In this basis, the boundary condition is given\n\u2020\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2020\nas MQ\u0303\n= Pd MD\u0303\nc Pd , ML\u0303 \u2243 Pe M\u1ebc c Pe . Since the decay\nwidth is proportional to the squared absolute values of\ndecay amplitudes, the phase of \u03b4 in the SUSY breaking\nmass matrix at the GUT scale and the phase of Pe in the\nYukawa couplings are less important for Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3).\nOn the other hand, the phases of \u03b4 and Pd are important\nfor M12 (Bs )SUSY . Due to those phases, the argument of\nM12 (Bs )SUSY can be completely free.\n\n-7\n\n)\n\n10\n\nBr(\n\nMBs 2 Vts\n\u2206MsSM\n=\n,\n(6)\n\u03be\nSM\nMBd\nVtd\n\u2206Md\np\np\nwhere \u03be \u2261 BBs fBs /( BBd fBd ) = 1.23 \u00b1 0.06 [10] is a\nratio of decay constants fBs(d) and bag parameters BBs(d)\nfor Bs(d) mesons.\nIt is convenient to parameterize the SUSY contribution by two real parameters CBs and \u03c6Bs in modelindependent way as [11]\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n42\n\n44\n\nMs Md\n\nSU(5)\n\n(m =200 GeV)\n\nSO(10)\n\n(m =200 GeV)\n\nSO(10)\n\n(m =400 GeV)\n\n46\n\n48\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n52\n\n54\n\n/\n\nFIG. 1: Minimal and maximal values for ratio of mass differences versus Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) under SU(5) and SO(10) boundary\nconditions. We show |\u03b4| = 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 points. The dotted\nlines show 90% CL region of the experimental data.\n\nIn Fig.1, we plot the maximal and minimal values of\nthe ratio of mass differences versus branching ratio of\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 in the case of tan \u03b2 = 10 where tan \u03b2 is a ratio\nof up- and down-type Higgs vacuum expectation values.\nIn the plot, we use M1/2 = 300 GeV and A0 = 0 for the\nuniversal gaugino mass and the universal trilinear scalar\ncoupling coefficient at GUT scale. The universal scalar\nmass at the GUT scale is m0 = 200 for the SU(5) plot,\nand m0 = 200, 400 GeV for the SO(10) plots. We use\n|Vtd /Vts | = 0.192 \u00b1 0.009 which is obtained by the global\nCKM parameter fit without using experimental data for\n\u2206Ms [11]. The ratio of mass differences is proportional\nto \u03be 2 /|Vtd |2 . The Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) is almost proportional\nto tan2 \u03b2, while \u2206Ms /\u2206Md does not depend on tan \u03b2\nmuch. We find that Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) does not have much\ndependence on m0 (for m0 <\n\u223c 500 GeV), while the SUSY\ncontribution of \u2206Ms depends on m0 .\nIn order to illustrate that any phase is possible for\nM12 (Bs )SUSY , we plot the real and the imaginary part\nof M12 (Bs ) in the case where Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22128\n[12] for tan \u03b2 = 10 in Fig.2. We use the same values for\nM1/2 and A0 as in Fig.1 and m0 = 500 GeV. Using SU(5)\nand SO(10) (hermitian) boundary mass values, we vary\nthe phase of \u03b4. With SO(10) symmetric boundary conditions, we fix \u03b4 to be real (positive) and vary the phase in\nthe diagonal phase matrix Pd . In the case of SO(10) with\nhermitian boundary conditions, the plot is a double-circle\ndue to the gluino contribution as shown in Eq.(8). Due to\nthe RGE effect, the double-circle does not overlap completely. We note that even if the radius of circle becomes\nlarge, \u2206Ms = 2|M12 (Bs )| has experimentally allowed\nSM\nsolutions, as long as |M12 (Bs )SUSY | <\n\u223c 2|M12 (Bs ) |,\nthough one needs to adjust the phases in boundary conditions.

The\ndotted lines show 90% CL region of the experimental data.\n\n-7\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the correlation between\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and Bs -B\u0304s mixing using SU(5) and SO(10) models. The SO(10) GUT models can have larger effects on\nBs -B\u0304s mixing compared to the SU(5) boundary conditions. We find that when Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) is enhanced around\nthe current experimental bound, Bs -B\u0304s mixing may also\ncontain large contribution from SUSY. Consequently, the\nphase of M12 (Bs ) is large for a SO(10) model and can be\ntested by measuring CP asymmetries of the Bs decay\nmodes. It is interesting to note that the phase of Bs -B\u0304s\nmixing can be large for smaller tan \u03b2 and large scalar\nmass m0 at the GUT scale.\n\nBr(\n\n)\n\n10\n\nBr(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3). In order to obtain a large phase, large m0\nand small tan \u03b2 are needed, which leads to an important\nimplication. The Higgs mass bounds for MSSM restricts\nthe lower values of tan \u03b2 and M1/2 . In the minimal supergravity model, the scalar mass m0 is restricted to be\nless than around 200 GeV (for m0 < 1 TeV) [13] for\ntan \u03b2 = 10 by the WMAP data [14], and as a result, the\nphase |\u03c6Bs | can not be very large. Interestingly, the large\nm0 solution (m0 > 1 TeV) for dark matter content [15]\nmay generate large \u03c6Bs \u223c 90o which is allowed by the\nexperimental data. However, the muon g \u2212 2 [16] (using\nthe e+ e\u2212 data) restricts m0 <\n\u223c 500 GeV at the 2 sigma\nlevel when tan \u03b2 = 10.\n\n-8\n\n10\n\nSO(10) (m =500 GeV, tan\n\n=10)\n\nSO(10) (m =200 GeV, tan\n\n=10)\n\nSO(10) (m =500 GeV, tan\n\n=30)\n\nSU(5)\n\n=10)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n(m =500 GeV, tan\n0\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nBs\nFIG. 3: max(2 |\u03c6Bs |) (degree) versus Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3).\nmax(2 |\n\n|)\n\nIn order to see the maximum allowed phase in the\nBs -B\u0304s mixing, we plot the maximal value of 2 |\u03c6Bs |\nversus Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) in Fig.3. We use the same values for M1/2 and A0 as in Fig.1. When \u03b4m20 in\nthe boundary condition becomes large, the radius of\nthe circle in Fig.2 becomes large, and |\u03c6Bs | can be\nlarge consequently.\nOne can approximately obtain\ng\u0303\nSM\n/M12\n|. When the |\u03c6Bs | is maxmax(sin 2 |\u03c6Bs |) \u2243 |M12\nimized, we find CBs \u2243 cos max(2 |\u03c6Bs |). The model\nindependent constraints for CBs and \u03c6Bs are CBs =\n0.97 \u00b1 0.27 and 2\u03c6Bs = (\u22124 \u00b1 30)o \u222a (186 \u00b1 30)o [11]. The\nphase \u03c6Bs can be measured by CP asymmetry of the decay Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and the semi-leptonic decay Bs \u2192 l\u2212 X.\nThe phase \u03c6Bs in the SO(10) case can be larger than\nin the SU(5) case since both LL and RR elements can\nbe large in the SO(10) case. As depicted in Fig.3, there\nis a chance for 2\u03c6Bs to be around 20o in the SO(10)\ncase before the parameter space gets ruled out by the\n\n[1] M. Kobayashi and T. Maskawa, Prog. Theor.
