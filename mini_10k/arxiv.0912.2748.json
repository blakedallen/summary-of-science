INTRODUCTION\n\nUltraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are characterized by a spectral energy distribution dominated by\ninfrared emission, and an absolute infrared luminosity\nwith LIR > 1012 L\u2299 (Sanders et al. 1988a; Sanders &\nMirabel 1996). This means that in ULIRGs, (1) very\nluminous energy sources with L > 1012 L\u2299 are present,\n(2) the energy sources are hidden by dust, which absorbs\nmost of the primary radiation, and (3) the heated dust\ngrains then radiate this energy as infrared dust emission. The dust-obscured energy sources are nuclear fusion occurring inside rapidly formed stars (starbursts)\nand/or the release of gravitational energy generated by\nspatially compact, mass-accreting, supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs) (i.e., AGN activity). Because the ULIRG\npopulation becomes very important at z > 1, in terms\nof cosmic infrared radiation density (Caputi et al. 2007),\nunderstanding the hidden energy sources of ULIRGs is\nclosely coupled with clarifying the connection between\nstar formation and SMBH growth in the dust-obscured\ngalaxy population of the early universe. Because distant\nULIRGs are generally faint, detailed studies of nearby\n(z < 0.3) ULIRGs continue to play an important role in\nunderstanding the nature of the ULIRG population of\nthe universe.\nElectronic address: masa.imanishi@nao.ac.jp\n1 Department of Astronomy, School of Science, Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588\n\nNearby ULIRGs have two important observational\nproperties. First, the fraction of optical Seyferts (optically identified AGNs) is known to be substantially\ngreater in ULIRGs, compared with galaxies with lower\ninfrared luminosities (LIR < 1012 L\u2299 ) (Veilleux et al.\n1999; Goto 2005). Second, although galaxies with LIR\n< 1012 L\u2299 generally exhibit strong, spatially extended\ninfrared emission originating from stars distributed inside them, the infrared dust emission of nearby ULIRGs\nis dominated by a spatially compact feature (Soifer et\nal. 2000, 2001), suggesting that a large amount of dust\nis concentrated in the nuclear regions of ULIRGs, and\nheated by spatially compact energy sources.\nBecause the nuclear dust concentration increases in\nULIRGs (Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Soifer et al. 2000),\nthe putative AGNs in ULIRG's cores are surrounded by\na large amount of gas and dust, and ionizing UV radiation from the AGN can be blocked at the inner part\n(<10 pc) in virtually all lines-of-sight (Hopkins et al.\n2005; Imanishi et al. 2006, 2007). Such buried AGNs\nlack well-developed narrow-line-regions (NLRs) at 10\u2013\n1000 pc scale, the primary sources of forbidden emission\nlines, and so are elusive through the conventional optical and infrared spectroscopic classification, looking for\nhigh-excitation forbidden emission lines from the NLRs\n(Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987; Kewley et al. 2006; Armus\net al. 2007; Farrah et al. 2007). Low-resolution infrared\n2.5\u201335 \u03bcm spectroscopy is an effective tool for studying\n\n\f2\n\nImanishi\n\nsuch elusive (Maiolino et al. 2003) buried AGNs, for the\nfollowing reasons. First, the effects of dust extinction are\nsufficiently small (<0.06AV Nishiyama et al. 2008; 2009)\nthat buried AGNs are detectable. Second, in a normal\nstarburst with moderate metallicity (>0.3 solar), consisting of UV-emitting HII regions, molecular gas and dust,\nand photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), the PAHs in the\nPDRs are excited by far-UV photons from stars without\nbeing destroyed, so strong PAH emission is usually detected (Sellgren 1981; Wu et al. 2006). However, PAHs\nin close proximity to an AGN are destroyed by the highenergy X-ray radiation of the AGN (Voit 1992), so that\nPAH emission is virtually absent from a pure AGN, as\ndemonstrated from observations (Moorwood 1986; Roche\net al. 1991; Genzel et al. 1998; Imanishi & Dudley 2000).\nIn a galaxy hosting an AGN, strong PAH emission can\nbe observed, if PAHs survive in the regions shielded from\nthe high-energy radiation of the AGN, and PAH-exciting\nfar-UV photons from local energy sources (i.e., stars) are\navailable there. Finally, in a normal starburst, stellar energy sources and gas/dust are spatially well mixed (Puxley 1991; McLeod et al. 1993; Forster Schreiber et al.\n2001), so that the absolute optical depths of dust absorption features in the infrared spectra cannot exceed\ncertain thresholds, whereas the optical depths can be\narbitrarily large in a buried AGN, because the energy\nsource (a compact mass-accreting SMBH) is more centrally concentrated than dust/gas (Imanishi & Maloney\n2003; Imanishi et al. 2006, 2007). Thus, in principle, starbursts and buried AGNs are distinguishable on the basis\nof the strengths of PAH emission and dust absorption\nfeatures in the infrared spectra.\nFrom the low-resolution infrared 2.5\u201335 \u03bcm spectra of\na large number of nearby ULIRGs, obtained with ISO,\nSpitzer and AKARI infrared satellites, the detectable\nburied AGN fraction has indeed been found to increase\nin ULIRGs, compared with galaxies with lower infrared\nluminosities (Tran et al. 2001; Imanishi et al. 2008; Imanishi 2009; Veilleux et al. 2009; Nardini et al. 2009). However, because the sample is not statistically complete,\nsome bias and ambiguity could remain. Observations of\na complete sample will clearly lead to a better understanding of the true nature of the nearby ULIRG population.\nIn this paper, we present the Spitzer IRS low-resolution\ninfrared 5\u201335 \u03bcm spectra of previously unobserved, optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs at z < 0.3. By combining these data with our previous results (Imanishi et\nal. 2007; Imanishi 2009), we can carry out a systematic investigation of the energetic importance of buried\nAGNs in nearby ULIRGs, based on the complete sample.\nThroughout this paper, H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M =\n0.3, and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 are adopted for the sake of consistency\nwith our previously published papers.\n2. TARGETS\n\nThe ULIRGs in the IRAS 1 Jy sample (Kim & Sanders\n1998) are our targets. This sample consists of 118\nULIRGs at z < 0.3, whose IRAS 60 \u03bcm fluxes are larger\nthan 1 Jy. Of these, 33 are optically classified as Seyferts,\nand 85 as non-Seyferts (Veilleux et al. 1999). The investigation of optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous,\nburied AGNs in the 85 optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs is\nour main objective. The 85 sources consist of 43 opti-\n\ncally LINER, 32 optically HII-region, and 10 optically\nunclassified ULIRGs (Veilleux et al. 1999).\nImanishi et al. (2007) investigated the buried AGN\nfraction in the complete sample of 48 ULIRGs at z <\n0.15, classified optically as LINERs and HII-regions, in\nthe IRAS 1 Jy sample, on the basis of Spitzer lowresolution infrared 5\u201335 \u03bcm spectra. These authors\nfound strong signatures of luminous buried AGNs in a\nsizable fraction (16/48; 33%) of the observed ULIRGs.\nFour optically unclassified ULIRGs at z < 0.15 were not\nstudied.\nImanishi (2009) extended the Spitzer IRS lowresolution infrared spectroscopic study to ULIRGs at\nz > 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts (LINERs,\nHII-regions, and unclassified), in the IRAS 1 Jy sample, by analyzing the spectra of 20 sources available at\nthat time. As a result of this extension, a large number of ULIRGs with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 are now included,\nso that a meaningful investigation of the buried AGN\nfraction as a function of galaxy infrared luminosity has\nbecome possible, by dividing galaxies into different infrared luminosity classes. Specifically, the classes are defined by LIR < 1012 L\u2299 , 1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 , and\nLIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 . Imanishi (2009) found a trend that the\ndetectable buried AGN fraction systematically increases\nwith increasing galaxy infrared luminosity. However, the\nULIRG sample was not statistically complete, because\nunobserved, optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs remained in\nthe IRAS 1 Jy sample.\nAmong 33 ULIRGs at z > 0.15 optically classified as\nnon-Seyferts in the IRAS 1 Jy sample, five LINER, six\nHII-region, and two optically unclassified ULIRGs were\nnot studied in Imanishi (2009). Additionally, four optically unclassified ULIRGs at z < 0.15 were not investigated by Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009). In\ntotal, there were 17 (20% of the total 85 sources) optically\nnon-Seyfert ULIRGs without published Spitzer IRS 5\u201335\n\u03bcm low-resolution spectra in the IRAS 1 Jy sample. Because Spitzer IRS 5\u201335 \u03bcm low-resolution spectroscopy of\none source (IRAS 08474+1813) was scheduled in Cycle 3,\nwe observed the remaining 16 ULIRGs on our own, during Spitzer Cycle 5. Table 1 summarizes the properties\nof these 17 ULIRGs.\n3. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nObservations of all 17 ULIRGs were performed with\nthe Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et al. 2004) on\nboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004).\nAll four modules, Short-Low 2 (SL2; 5.2\u20137.7 \u03bcm) and\n1 (SL1; 7.4\u201314.5 \u03bcm), and Long-Low 2 (LL2; 14.0\u201321.3\n\u03bcm) and 1 (LL1; 19.5\u201338.0 \u03bcm) were used to obtain the\nfull 5\u201335 \u03bcm low-resolution (R \u223c 100) spectra. Table\n2 contains details of the observation log. The slit width\nwas 3.\u2032\u2032 6 or two pixels for SL2 (1.\u2032\u2032 8 pixel\u22121 ) and 3.\u2032\u2032 7 or \u223c2\npixels for SL1 (1.\u2032\u2032 8 pixel\u22121 ). For LL2 and LL1, the slit\nwidths were 10.\u2032\u2032 5 and 10.\u2032\u2032 7, respectively, corresponding\nto \u223c2 pixels for both LL2 (5.\u2032\u2032 1 pixel\u22121 ) and LL1 (5.\u2032\u2032 1\npixel\u22121 ).\nThe latest pipeline-processed data products available\nat the time of our analysis were used. Frames taken at\nposition A were subtracted from those taken at position\nB to remove background emission, consisting mostly of\nzodiacal light. The spectra were then extracted in the\nstandard manner. Apertures with 4\u20136 pixels were em-\n\n\fBuried AGNs in a complete sample of nearby ULIRGs\nployed for SL and LL data. All sources were dominated\nby spatially compact emission whose size is similar to\nthe PSF of SL and LL. The spectra extracted for the\nA and B positions were then summed. Wavelength and\nflux calibrations were made on the basis of the Spitzer\npipeline-processed data. For the SL1 spectra, the data\nat \u03bbobs > 14.5 \u03bcm in the observed frame are invalid (Infrared Spectrograph Data Handbook, version 1.0), and\nthus they were removed. For the LL1 spectra, the data\nat \u03bbobs > 35 \u03bcm were not used, because they are noisy\nand not necessary for our scientific discussions.\nFor the flux calibration, we did not re-calibrate our\nspectra using the IRAS measurements at 12 \u03bcm and 25\n\u03bcm, because the IRAS 12 \u03bcm and/or 25 \u03bcm fluxes are\nonly upper limits in many sources (Table 1). Hence, the\nabsolute flux calibration is dependent on the accuracy of\nthe pipeline-processed data, which is taken to be better\nthan 20% for SL and LL (Infrared Spectrograph Data\nHandbook). This level of flux uncertainty does not significantly affect our main conclusions. For ULIRGs with\nIRAS 25 \u03bcm detection, we confirmed that the Spitzer\nIRS 25 \u03bcm flux agrees with the IRAS 25 \u03bcm data within\n30%. For ULIRGs with IRAS 25 \u03bcm non-detection, the\nmeasured Spizter IRS 25 \u03bcm flux is always smaller than\nthe IRAS 25 \u03bcm upper limits.\nFor all ULIRGs, flux discrepancies between SL1 and\nLL2 were discernible, ranging from 40% to a factor of\n\u223c2, and the SL1 flux (3.\u2032\u2032 7 wide slit) was always smaller\nthan the LL2 flux (10.\u2032\u2032 5). The discrepancies were generally large in double-nuclei ULIRGs with separations of\na few to several arcsec (marked sources in the column 1\nof Table 2), possibly because the LL2 spectra cover the\nemission from both nuclei and a diffuse component, while\nthe SL1 spectra only probe the emission from a brighter\nnucleus. We adjusted the SL1 (and SL2) flux to match\nthe LL2 flux, to minimize missing PAH fluxes. Appropriate spectral binning with 2, 4, or 8 pixels was applied to\nreduce the scattering of data points particularly at SL2\n(5.2\u20137.7 \u03bcm) and LL2 (14.0\u201321.3 \u03bcm) for faint ULIRGs,\nand at \u03bbobs \u223c 10 \u03bcm for ULIRGs that show deep 9.7 \u03bcm\nsilicate dust absorption features.\n4. RESULTS\n\nThe infrared 5\u201335 \u03bcm low-resolution spectra of the 17\nobserved ULIRGs are shown in Figure 1. The full 5\u201335\n\u03bcm spectra of these ULIRGs are published here for the\nfirst time.\nThe spectra in Figure 1 are useful for observing the\noverall 5\u201335 \u03bcm spectral shapes and broad 9.7 \u03bcm and\n18 \u03bcm silicate dust absorption features, but not for observing PAH emission. Following Imanishi et al. (2007)\nand Imanishi (2009), Figure 2 presents enlarged spectra\nat \u03bbobs = 5.2\u201314.5 \u03bcm to better exhibit the PAH emission\nproperties.\n4.1. PAH emission\n\nAll ULIRGs in Figure 2 show clear signs of PAH emission at \u03bbrest = 6.2 \u03bcm, 7.7 \u03bcm, and 11.3 \u03bcm in the rest\nframe. To estimate the strengths of these PAH emission, we adopted a linear continuum, following Imanishi\net al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009). Data points at slightly\nshorter and longer wavelengths than the 6.2 \u03bcm, 7.7 \u03bcm,\nand 11.3 \u03bcm PAH emission were used to determine linear\ncontinuum levels, which are shown as solid lines in Figure\n\n3\n\n2. PAH emission features above the adopted continuum\nlevels were fitted with Gaussian profiles. The estimated\nrest-frame equivalent widths (EWPAH ) and luminosities\nof the 6.2 \u03bcm, 7.7 \u03bcm, and 11.3 \u03bcm PAH emission are\nsummarized in Table 3.\nAs noted by Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009),\nwe estimated the strength of the 7.7 \u03bcm PAH emission in such a way that the uncertainty caused by the\nstrong, broad 9.7 \u03bcm silicate dust absorption feature is\nminimized. This definition of the 7.7 \u03bcm PAH emission\nstrength is significantly different from that used in previous papers (e.g., Genzel et al. 1998). We will not use\n7.7 \u03bcm PAH emission strengths in our main discussions,\nbecause of the difficulty of comparing our data with data\nin the literature, as well as possible large uncertainties in\nthe 7.7 \u03bcm PAH strengths.\n4.2. Silicate absorption\n\nTo estimate the strengths of the silicate dust absorp\u2032\n\u2032\ntion features, we use \u03c49.7\nand \u03c418\n, defined by Imanishi et\n\u2032\nal. (2007). The value of \u03c49.7\nis the optical depth of the\n9.7 \u03bcm silicate absorption feature, relative to a powerlaw continuum, determined from data points at \u03bbrest =\n7.1 \u03bcm and 14.2 \u03bcm, to minimize the effects of PAH\n\u2032\nis the optical depth of the\nemission. The value of \u03c418\n18 \u03bcm silicate absorption feature, relative to a powerlaw continuum determined from data points at \u03bbrest =\n14.2 \u03bcm and 24 \u03bcm. These continua are shown as dotted\nlines in Figure 1. Because these continuum levels are determined using data points just outside the 9.7 \u03bcm and\n18 \u03bcm features, and close to the absorption peaks, the\nmeasured optical depths are taken as true dips caused\n\u2032\n\u2032\nby the silicate dust absorption feature. The \u03c49.7\nand \u03c418\nvalues were estimated from several data points, close to\n\u2032\nvalues for all the ULIRGs\nthe absorption peaks. The \u03c49.7\n\u2032\nare shown in Table 4 (column 2). The \u03c418\nvalues are also\nshown in Table 4 (column 3) for ULIRGs with clearly\ndetected 18 \u03bcm silicate absorption features.\n4.3. Ice absorption\nMany ULIRGs display dips on the shorter wavelength\nside of the 6.2 \u03bcm PAH emission, which we ascribe to\nthe 6.0 \u03bcm H2 O ice absorption feature (bending mode).\nFigure 3 presents enlarged spectra at \u03bbobs = 5.2\u20139 \u03bcm\nfor ULIRGs with clearly detected ice absorption features.\nThe spectrum of IRAS 14202+2615 is also included, as an\nexample of non-detection. The observed optical depths\n(\u03c46.0 ) are summarized in Table 5 for detected sources.\nThe detection rate of this 6.0 \u03bcm ice absorption feature\nis substantially higher in optically LINER ULIRGs (5/5;\n100%) than in HII-region ULIRGs (1/6; 17%).\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nFor the sake of consistency, we use the criteria employed by Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009) to\nstudy buried AGNs in optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs. We\nfirst search for ULIRGs with luminous buried AGN signatures in infrared 5\u201335 \u03bcm spectra, and then estimate\nthe extinction-corrected intrinsic luminosities of buried\nAGNs, based on the observed fluxes at \u223c10 \u03bcm and dust\nextinction toward the 10 \u03bcm continuum emitting regions\n(Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi 2009).\nSeveral other methods of evaluating the energetic importance of buried AGNs, based on Spitzer IRS infrared\n\n\f4\n\nImanishi\n\nlow-resolution spectra, have been proposed in the literature (Veilleux et al. 2009; Nardini et al. 2009). In the\nmethods of Veilleux et al. (2009), AGN and starburst\nzero-points were derived from unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies, respectively. Then, relative buried\nAGN contributions to the observed fluxes of continuum\nand line emission at infrared 5\u201335 \u03bcm were derived. No\ndust extinction correction was applied to estimate buried\nAGN luminosities. Even though dust extinction at 5\u2013\n35 \u03bcm is smaller than that at shorter wavelengths, using the observed fluxes could underestimate the intrinsic\nburied AGN luminosities, because emission from buried\nAGNs is more highly flux-attenuated than the surrounding starbursts in individual ULIRGs, as well as unobscured AGNs used to determine the AGN zero-points.\nNardini et al. (2009) applied dust extinction correction\nto estimate the intrinsic buried AGN luminosities, but\ntheir modeling utilized only 5\u20138 \u03bcm spectra. Our methods use a wider-wavelength range (5\u201335 \u03bcm) of Spitzer\nIRS spectra, and dust extinction is also taken into account to estimate the buried AGN luminosities.\n5.1. Detected modestly obscured starbursts\n\nAside from the strong 9.7 \u03bcm silicate absorption peak,\nthe flux attenuation of the continuum emission at \u03bbrest\n> 5 \u03bcm is small (<0.5 mag) for dust extinction with AV\n< 20 mag (Nishiyama et al. 2008, 2009). Thus, the observed PAH emission luminosities at \u03bbrest > 5 \u03bcm can\nbe used to roughly estimate the intrinsic luminosities of\nmodestly obscured (AV < 20 mag) PAH-emitting normal\nstarbursts (with PDRs and modest metallicity), provided\nthat the PAH emission and infrared luminosities proportionally correlate in the starbursts (Peeters et al. 2004;\nSoifer et al. 2002). Since the metallicity of ULIRGs is\nestimated to be solar or even higher (Rupke et al. 2008;\nVeilleux et al. 2009), the assumption of PAH-emitting\nstarbursts is valid in ULIRGs (Wu et al. 2006; Madden et\nal. 2006; O'Halloran et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2007). Table\n3 (columns 8 and 9) lists the values of the 6.2 \u03bcm PAH to\ninfrared luminosity ratio, L6.2PAH /LIR , and the 11.3 \u03bcm\nPAH to infrared luminosity ratio, L11.3PAH /LIR . In normal starburst galaxies with modest dust obscuration (AV\n< 20 mag), the ratios are estimated to be L6.2PAH /LIR\n\u223c 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 (Peeters et al. 2004) and L11.3PAH /LIR \u223c\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 (Soifer et al. 2002) 2 . Figure 4 compares the\n6.2 \u03bcm and 11.3 \u03bcm PAH luminosities with the observed\ninfrared luminosities.\nThe observed L6.2PAH /LIR ratios are (0.3\u20132.4) \u00d7 10\u22123\n(Table 3), or 9\u201371 % of 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for modestly obscured starburst galaxies. In the majority of the observed ULIRGs, the ratios are <1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 , or <50\n% of 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 (see also Figure 4). Taken at face\nvalue, the modestly obscured starbursts detected in these\nULIRGs account for 9\u201371 % (mostly <50 %) of their infrared luminosities. The same argument can be applied\nto the observed L11.3PAH /LIR ratios for the ULIRGs. The\nL11.3PAH /LIR ratios are (0.3\u20131.8) \u00d7 10\u22123 (Table 3), or\n21\u2013100 % of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 for modestly obscured starburst\ngalaxies. On the basis of the L11.3PAH /LIR ratios, there\n2 Smith et al. (2007) derived high PAH to infrared luminosity\nratios, by including underlying plateau components as PAH fluxes.\nWe employ the ratios obtained by Peeters et al. (2004) and Soifer\net al. (2002), because of their similar continuum choices to ours.\n\nare some ULIRGs whose infrared luminosities can be explained by the detected modestly obscured (AV < 20\nmag) starbursts. However, for ULIRGs with <0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(<50 % of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 ), additional energy sources would\nbe required. The 11.3 \u03bcm PAH emission tends to provide higher contributions from modestly obscured starbursts to the infrared luminosities of ULIRGs, than the\n6.2 \u03bcm PAH emission (Figure 4), possibly because the\n11.3 \u03bcm PAH emission originates in larger-sized PAHs\nwhich may be less susceptible to destruction by the energetic radiation from AGNs and intense starbursts in\nULIRGs (Smith et al. 2007). Luminosities that are not\naccounted for by the detected modestly obscured starbursts might originate from (1) highly obscured (AV >>\n20 mag) starbursts, in which the PAH emission flux is\nsubstantially attenuated by dust extinction, and/or (2)\nburied AGNs that produce strong infrared radiation, but\nvirtually no PAH emission.\nWe note that emission from extreme starbursts, which\nconsist of HII-regions only, without PDRs and molecular gas, can be PAH-free, because PAH molecules can\nbe destroyed inside the HII-regions themselves (Sellgren\n1981). If starbursts are exceptionally more centrally concentrated than the surrounding molecular gas and dust\n(Figure 1e of Imanishi et al. 2007), such HII-region-only\nstarbusts could happen. However, in the case of ULIRG's\ncores, such extreme starbursts require extremely high\nemission surface brightnesses, and so are unlikely (Imanishi et al. 2007), if not completely ruled out. We thus use\nthe term \"buried AGN signatures\", rather than \"buried\nAGN evidence\" throughout this manuscript.\n5.2. ULIRGs that could contain luminous buried AGNs\n5.2.1. Low equivalent width PAH emission\n\nHighly-obscured normal starbursts and buried AGNs\nare basically distinguishable, based on the equivalent\nwidth of the PAH emission. A PAH equivalent width\n(EWPAH ) must always be large in a normal starburst\n(with PDRs) with a mixed dust/source geometry, regardless of the amount of dust extinction, because both\nthe PAH and nearby continuum emission are similarly\nflux-attenuated. Thus, a small EWPAH value suggests a\ncontribution from a PAH-free continuum-emitting energy\nsource, namely an AGN (Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi\n2009).\nFollowing Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009),\nwe classify ULIRGs with EW6.2PAH < 180 nm and\nEW11.3PAH < 200 nm as sources displaying clear signatures of luminous AGNs, because a considerable contribution from a PAH-free continuum would be required\nfor these sources. Figure 5 is a plot of the distribution of\nEW6.2PAH and EW11.3PAH values. Table 6 (columns 2\u20133)\nrecords the detection or non-detection of buried AGN signatures in terms of the PAH equivalent width threshold.\nThe EW6.2PAH method provides a much larger buried\nAGN fraction (7/17; 41%) than the EW11.3PAH method\n(2/17; 12%), as seen in Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009). An explanation for this is that the 11.3 \u03bcm\nPAH emission feature is inside the strong 9.7 \u03bcm silicate\ndust absorption feature. Thus, the buried AGN continuum emission at \u03bbrest \u223c 11.3 \u03bcm is severely attenuated,\nand has little effect on the equivalent widths of the 11.3\n\u03bcm PAH emission from less obscured starburst regions\n\n\fBuried AGNs in a complete sample of nearby ULIRGs\noutside the AGNs (Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi 2009).\n5.2.2. Optical depths of dust absorption features\n\nBased on the low EWPAH method, a buried AGN with\nvery weak starbursts is easily detectable. If strong starburst activity is present, AGN detection becomes difficult, but a weakly obscured AGN is still detectable, because dilution of the PAH emission by the AGN's PAHfree continuum can be significant. However, a deeply\nburied AGN with strong starbursts is very difficult to\ndetect. Even if the intrinsic luminosity of a buried AGN\nis large, the AGN flux will be more highly attenuated by\ndust extinction than the surrounding starburst emission,\nkeeping the observed EWPAH value quite large.\nTo determine the presence of a deeply buried AGN\nwith strong starbursts, we use the optical depths of the\nsilicate dust absorption features. Specifically, these values can be used to distinguish whether the energy sources\nare spatially well mixed with dust (a normal starburst),\nor are more centrally concentrated than the dust (a\nburied AGN) (\u00a71). Imanishi et al. (2007) obtained a\n\u2032\nmaximum value of \u03c49.7\n= 1.7 for a normal starburst with\na mixed dust/source geometry. Considering the possible\n\u2032\nestimate, coming from continuncertainties of the \u03c49.7\nuum determination ambiguities and statistical errors of\n\u2032\n\u2265\nindividual data points, we classify ULIRGs with \u03c49.7\n2 as potential locations of luminous, but deeply buried\nAGNs with centrally concentrated energy source geome\u2032\n\u2265 2 (Tables 4 and 6).\ntries. Five ULIRGs have \u03c49.7\nAs noted by Imanishi (2009), although this large \u03c49.7\nmethod is sensitive to deeply buried AGNs, it is obviously insensitive to weakly obscured AGNs, which are\nbetter probed with the low EWPAH method. Thus, the\nlow EWPAH and large \u03c49.7 methods are complementary to\neach other. At the same time, a normal starburst nucleus\nwith a mixed dust/source geometry and a large amount\nof foreground screen dust in an edge-on host galaxy (Figure 1d of Imanishi et al. 2007), and an exceptionally\ncentrally-concentrated starburst (Figure 1e of Imanishi\n\u2032\nvalues.\net al. 2007), are capable of producing large \u03c49.7\nHowever, it is unlikely that the majority of the ULIRGs\n\u2032\nwith \u03c49.7\n\u2265 2 fit these non-AGN cases (Imanishi et al.\n2007; Imanishi 2009).\n5.2.3. Strong dust temperature gradients\n\nAs explained by Imanishi et al. (2007), a buried AGN\nwith a centrally concentrated energy source geometry\nshould have a strong dust temperature gradient, because\nthe inner dust (close to the central energy source) has a\nhigher temperature than the outer dust, whereas a normal starburst nucleus with a mixed dust/source geometry does not exhibit this behavior. The presence of a\nstrong dust temperature gradient could be detected by\ncomparing the optical depths of the 9.7 \u03bcm and 18 \u03bcm\nsilicate dust absorption features, as long as the contaminations from weakly obscured starbursts to observed in\u2032\n\u2032\nfrared fluxes are not severe. \u03c418\n/\u03c49.7\n< 0.3 could be taken\nas the signature of a strong dust temperature gradient\n(Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi 2009). This could provide an additional signature for a buried AGN. Although\nthis was the case for 12 sources studied by Imanishi et\nal. (2007) and Imanishi (2009), no such case was found\namong the 17 newly observed ULIRGs (Table 4, column\n\n5\n\n4). Because of the contamination from weakly obscured\nstarburst activity, as well as other possible ambiguities\n(Imanishi et al. 2007), not all buried AGNs actually sat\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nisfy \u03c418\n/\u03c49.7\n< 0.3. The criterion \u03c418\n/\u03c49.7\n< 0.3 is a sufficient condition for an additional signature of a buried\nAGN, but it is not a necessary condition.\n5.2.4. Combination of energy diagnostic methods\n\nTable 6 (column 5) summarizes the strengths of the\ndetected buried AGN signatures in the Spitzer IRS 5\u201335\n\u03bcm spectra, based on the (1) low EWPAH and (2) large\n\u2032\n\u03c49.7\nmethods. If buried AGN signatures are found by\nboth methods, or by the first method, the ULIRGs are\nclassified as strong buried AGN candidates, marked with\nopen circles. Eight ULIRGs show strong signatures of\nluminous buried AGNs (Table 6).\nThe detection rate of luminous buried AGNs in the\nnewly observed optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs (8/17;\n47%) is significantly smaller than the rate obtained by\nImanishi (2009) (14/20; 70%). This may be partly due\nto the smaller fraction of ULIRGs with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299\n(6/17; 35%) in this sample, compared with Imanishi\n(2009) (17/20; 85%).\n5.2.5. Extinction-corrected intrinsic buried AGN\n\nluminosities\nFor ULIRGs with very low PAH equivalent widths, the\nobserved fluxes are taken to be mostly the result of AGNheated, PAH-free dust continuum emission. We can estimate the extinction-corrected intrinsic dust emission luminosity at \u223c10 \u03bcm (\u03bdF\u03bd ), heated by the AGN, on the\nbasis of the observed fluxes at \u03bbrest \u223c 10 \u03bcm and dust\nextinction toward the 10 \u03bcm continuum emitting regions\n\u2032\n(Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi 2009).\ninferred from \u03c49.7\nAs argued by Imanishi et al. (2007) and Imanishi (2009),\nin a pure AGN with a simple spherical dust distribution,\ndust emission luminosity is conserved at each temperature from hot inside regions to cool outside regions (Figure 2 of Imanishi et al. 2007). The extinction-corrected\n10 \u03bcm luminosity (\u03bdF\u03bd ) should be comparable to the intrinsic luminosity of the AGN's primary radiation.\nTo obtain the estimate, we followed Imanishi et al.\n(2007) and Imanishi (2009). The flux attenuation of the 8\nor 13 \u03bcm continuum outside the 9.7 \u03bcm silicate feature is\n\u2032\n10\u03c49.7 /2.3/2.5 (Rieke & Lebofsky 1985), and ranges from a\n\u2032\nfactor of 1.3 (IRAS 14202+2615; \u03c49.7\n\u223c 0.7) to 3.3 (IRAS\n\u2032\n04074\u22122801; \u03c49.7 \u223c 3.0). We found that the extinctioncorrected intrinsic buried AGN luminosities for selected\nULIRGs with very low EWPAH values are a few \u00d7 1045\nergs s\u22121 , or \u223c1012 L\u2299 in the maximum case (Table 7).\nFigure 6 compares the intrinsic buried AGN luminosity\nand the infrared luminosity. The detected buried AGNs\ncould explain a significant, but not dominant fraction (6\u2013\n33%), of the luminosities of these ULIRGs. In Table 7,\nthe luminosities of the detected modestly obscured starbursts, estimated from the L6.2PAH and L11.3PAH values,\nare also listed for the sake of comparison.\nOur method to estimate the intrinsic buried AGN luminosities is very simple and straightforward, with a small\namount of free parameters. The largest possible uncertainty is dust extinction curve in ULIRGs, which might\nbe different from that established in the Galactic interstellar medium which we adopted. Different dust grain\n\n\f6\n\nImanishi\n\nsize distribution can produce different dust extinction ratio between widely separate wavelengths, such as optical\nand 10 \u03bcm. However, as mentioned by Imanishi et al.\n(2007; their Appendix), our estimate is dependent only\non the dust extinction ratio between 8 or 13 \u03bcm con\u2032\ntinuum and \u03c49.7\n, which should be insensitive to dust size\ndistribution, because of the proximity of the wavelengths.\nHence, our method is robust to this possible uncertainty.\n5.3. Buried AGN fraction as a function of galaxy\n\ninfrared luminosity\nImanishi et al. (2007) investigated the presence of luminous buried AGNs in 48 ULIRGs at z < 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts (28 LINER and 20 HIIregion ULIRGs). Imanishi (2009) did the same in 20\nULIRGs at z > 0.15, classified optically as non-Seyferts\n(10 LINER, 6 HII-region, 4 unclassified ULIRGs). In\nthe present research, we have continued this work in 13\noptically non-Seyfert ULIRGs at z > 0.15 (5 LINER, 6\nHII-region, 2 unclassified ULIRGs) and four optically unclassified ULIRGs at z < 0.15. Taken together, these 85\nobserved sources comprise a complete sample of optically\nnon-Seyfert ULIRGs in the IRAS 1 Jy sample.\nFollowing Imanishi (2009), we divide the observed\nULIRGs into those with 1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 and\nthose with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 . After combining the results\nof Imanishi et al. (2007), Imanishi (2009) and this paper,\nwe summarize the detectable buried AGN fraction in Table 8. Using this complete sample, we confirm the previously discovered trend (Imanishi et al. 2008; Imanishi\n2009; Veilleux et al. 2009; Nardini et al. 2009) that the\ndetectable buried AGN fraction is significantly higher in\nULIRGs with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 (22/31; 71%) than in those\nwith 1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 (15/54; 28%). Figure 7\nillustrates this trend by including galaxies with LIR <\n1012 L\u2299 . Figure 5 displays the distributions of EW6.2PAH ,\n\u2032\nas functions of galaxy infrared lumiEW11.3PAH and \u03c49.7\nnosity. It is clear that the fraction of galaxies that meet\nthe requirements for a buried AGN increases with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity in all plots.\nIn Table 8, we also find that buried AGNs are more\nimportant in LINER ULIRGs (21/43; 49%) than in HIIregion ULIRGs (12/32; 38%), as has been previously\nsuggested (Imanishi et al. 2006, 2007, 2008; Imanishi\n2009). However, the difference is now small in this complete sample, and is possibly caused by a higher fraction\nof ULIRGs with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 in the LINER sample\n(18/43; 42%) than in the HII-region sample (10/32; 31%)\n(Table 8). The buried AGN fraction is also higher in\nULIRGs at z > 0.15 than in those at z \u2264 0.15, but this\nmay be due to the presence of a larger fraction of more\nluminous ULIRGs in a more distant sample.\nFor an AGN surrounded by dust with a torus-shaped\ndistribution, the visibility of the central AGN is expected\nto increase with increasing AGN luminosity, because the\ninnermost dust sublimation radius of the torus is proportional to the square root of the central AGN luminosity, and thus (assuming a constant torus scale height)\nthe opening angle of the AGN is greater in luminous\nAGNs (the so-called receding torus model: Lawrence\n1991; Simpson 2005; Arshakian 2005). In this scenario,\nthe fraction of optically elusive buried AGNs is not large\nin luminous AGNs. However, this model is applicable\nonly if the total amount of dust surrounding the central\n\nAGN does not vary significantly, depending on the galaxy\nand AGN luminosity. ULIRGs are driven by mergers of\ngas-rich galaxies, and gas/dust is quickly transported to\nthe nuclear regions by the gravitational torques, producing a highly-concentrated nuclear gas/dust distribution\n(Hopkins et al. 2006). AGNs can be easily buried by the\nincreasing amount of nuclear gas/dust surrounding the\ncentral AGNs, and thus we believe that a high buried\nAGN fraction is a natural state of affairs in ULIRGs.\nThe higher fractions of buried AGNs (found in this\nwork) and optical Seyferts (Veilleux et al. 1999; Goto\n2005) indicate that AGNs become intrinsically more\nimportant with increasing galaxy infrared luminosity. Namely, the AGN-starburst connections depend on\ngalaxy luminosity. This is the primary consequence of\nour results.\nFigure 6 suggests that AGN's energetic contributions\nare generally 10\u201350%, or \u223c30% in median value, in\nULIRGs with buried AGN signatures, which roughly\nagrees with other independent estimates (Veilleux et al.\n2009; Nardini et al. 2009) in overall ULIRG sample. If\n30% of the infrared luminosity comes from a buried AGN\nin a ULIRG with LIR = 1012.3 L\u2299 (= 2 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 ), then\nthe remaining infrared luminosity, originating in starbursts (including highly obscured AV >> 20 mag ones),\nis 1.4 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 . In the meanwhile, buried AGN contribution is generally insignificant in galaxies with LIR =\n1011.3 L\u2299 (= 2 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 ) (Figure 7), and in this case,\nthe starburst-originating luminosity is \u223c2 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 .\nNamely, in ULIRGs, the relative energetic importance\nof buried AGN is higher, but the absolute luminosities\nof starbursts, and thereby the star-formation rates, are\nalso higher than galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Unless the starburst duration time is drastically\ndifferent, ULIRGs will produce more stars in the future,\nand evolve into more massive galaxies with larger stellar\nmasses, than less infrared luminous galaxies.\nGiven the mass correlation between SMBH and\nspheroidal stellar component (Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000), galaxies with lower infrared luminosities should also contain SMBHs whose masses are\nproportional to those of spheroidal stars. The higher\nAGN contributions in ULIRGs suggest that SMBHs in\nULIRGs (progenitors of massive galaxies) are actively\nmass-accreting, and consequently, can have stronger radiation feedbacks to the surrounding gas and dust than\nmildly mass accreting SMBHs in less infrared luminous\ngalaxies. A related phenomenon may be galaxy downsizing, where the more massive galaxies (with currently\nlarger stellar masses) completed their major star formation during an earlier cosmic age (Cowie et al. 1996;\nBundy et al. 2005). It has been suggested that in these\nmore massive galaxies, AGN feedback was stronger in\nthe past, heating or expelling gas and suppressing further star formation over a shorter time scale (Granato et\nal. 2004; Bower et al. 2006; Sijacki et al. 2007). Buried\nAGNs surrounded by a large amount of gas and dust may\nhave particularly strong feedback, compared to already\nvisible AGNs with a relatively thin dust covering, and\nthus are the important population for determining the\ninterplay between AGNs and host galaxies.\nFigure 8 illustrates our findings that buried AGNs are\nrelatively more important energetically in galaxies that\nare currently more infrared luminous, and in the future,\n\n\fBuried AGNs in a complete sample of nearby ULIRGs\nthese galaxies will evolve into more massive galaxies with\nlarger stellar masses. The energetic contributions from\nburied AGNs become discernible in ULIRGs, which are\nthought to evolve into galaxies with stellar masses of\nseveral \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , based on infrared velocity dispersion measurements of ULIRG's host galaxies (Dasyra et\nal. 2006). A similar eventual spheroidal stellar mass is\nderived for ULIRGs with detectable buried AGN signatures, from the intrinsic buried AGN luminosities (Imanishi 2009), if we assume that AGN luminosities are Eddington limits and if the widely accepted mass correlation between SMBHs and spheroidal steller components\nholds (Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000).\nThis mass with several \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 roughly corresponds\nto the stellar mass that separates red, massive galaxies\nwith low current star formation rates (major star formation has already been completed) and blue, less massive\ngalaxies with ongoing active star formation in the local\nuniverse (Kauffmann et al. 2003). Thus, our results may\noffer support to the AGN feedback scenario as the origin\nof the galaxy downsizing phenomenon.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented the results of Spitzer IRS infrared\n5\u201335 \u03bcm low-resolution (R \u223c 100) spectroscopy of 17\nnearby ULIRGs at z < 0.2, optically classified as nonSeyferts (LINERs, HII-regions, and unclassified, i.e., no\noptical AGN signatures). Optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous buried AGNs were searched for in\nthese optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs, on the basis of the\nstrengths of PAH emission and silicate dust absorption\nfeatures. We then combined these results with those of\nour previous studies of nearby ULIRGs, using Spitzer\nIRS, to investigate the energetic importance of buried\nAGNs in a complete sample of optically non-Seyfert\nULIRGs in the local universe at z < 0.3 (85 sources altogether). We arrived at the following primary conclusions.\n1. Among the 17 newly observed optically non-Seyfert\nULIRGs, the signatures of important energy contributions from buried AGNs were found in eight\nsources. In these sources, the extinction-corrected\nintrinsic buried AGN luminosities were estimated\nat up to \u223c1012 L\u2299 , accounting for a significant fraction (6\u201333%) of the observed infrared luminosities\nof these ULIRGs.\n2. By combining our new results with those of our\nprevious studies (Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi\n2009), we found that buried AGNs are energetically\n\n7\n\nimportant in 37 sources of the complete ULIRG\nsample of 85 (37/85 = 44%), confirming previous\nsuggestion that optically elusive, luminous buried\nAGNs are common in the ULIRGs of the local universe.\n3. We investigated the fraction of detectable luminous\nburied AGNs by separating ULIRGs with 1012 L\u2299\n\u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 (54 sources) and LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299\n(31 sources). We found that luminous buried AGNs\nwere much more common in the latter ULIRGs\n(22/31 = 71%) than in the former ULIRGs (15/54\n= 28%), confirming the previous arguments that\nburied AGNs become more energetically important\nwith increasing galaxy infrared luminosity.\n4. Given the higher fraction of optical Seyferts (optically identified AGNs) in ULIRGs with higher\ninfrared luminosities, luminous AGNs are more\ncommon in ULIRGs with LIR \u2265 1012.3 L\u2299 than\nin ULIRGs with 1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 . Because the detection rate of both optically identified\nSeyfert AGNs and optically elusive buried AGNs is\nsubstantially lower in galaxies with lower infrared\nluminosities (LIR < 1012 L\u2299 ), we can conclude that\nthe energetic importance of AGNs increases with\nincreasing galaxy infrared luminosity, suggesting\nthat the AGN-starburst connections are luminosity dependent. This may be related to the widelyproposed AGN feedback scenario for the galaxy\ndownsizing phenomenon.\n\nThis work is based on observations made with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology,\nunder a contract with NASA.

Optically non-Seyfert ULIRGs that were newly studied in this paper are plotted with \"X\" symbols. Open circles\nrepresent sources studied in previously published papers (Imanishi et al. 2007; Imanishi 2009). The solid line indicates that the buried\nAGN luminosity equals the infrared luminosity. In other words, the observed infrared luminosity can be fully accounted for with a buried\nAGN. The dashed and dotted lines respectively indicate that 50% and 10% of the infrared luminosity can be explained by a buried AGN.\n\n\fBuried AGNs in a complete sample of nearby ULIRGs\n\n25\n\nFig. 7.- Fraction of sources with strong buried AGN signatures as a function of galaxy infrared luminosity. For ULIRGs (LIR \u2265 1012 L\u2299 ),\nthe fraction is derived from the combination of Imanishi et al. (2007), Imanishi (2009) and this paper. The total number of sources is 54 for\nULIRGs with 1012 L\u2299 \u2264 LIR < 1012.3 L\u2299 , and 31 for those with LIR \u22651012.3 L\u2299 . For galaxies with LIR < 1012 L\u2299 , the fraction is obtained\nfrom the limited sample of 18 galaxies studied in Brandl et al. (2006), and does not necessarily imply that no buried AGNs are present.\nAlthough the sample is not statistically complete at LIR < 1012 L\u2299 , there should not be a strong bias, because the sources in this plot are\nessentially selected in the same way, based on the IRAS 60 \u03bcm fluxes.\n\nFig. 8.- Schematic diagram of the energetic importance of buried AGNs (B-AGN) and starbursts as a function of galaxy infrared\nluminosity. Both the abscissa and ordinate are plotted in a linear scale. SFR stands for a star formation rate. In galaxies with higher\ninfrared luminosities, the energetic importance of buried AGNs is relatively higher, and higher SFRs suggest that these galaxies will evolve\ninto more massive galaxies with larger stellar masses.\n\n\f"}
