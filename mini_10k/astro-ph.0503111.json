Bergeron\nD\u00e9partement de Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, C.P. 6128,\nSuccursale Centre-Ville, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, H3C 3J7\nAbstract.\nWhite dwarf masses can be determined in several ways. Here\nwe compare masses obtained from Balmer line spectroscopy with those derived\nfrom trigonometric parallax measurements for an ensemble of cool hydrogenatmosphere white dwarfs.\n\n1.\n\nFitting Technique\n\nOur photometric and spectroscopic sample is composed of all DA stars in the\ntrigonometric parallax sample of Bergeron, Leggett, & Ruiz (2001; BLR hereafter). We restrict, however, our analysis to objects above 6500 K (52 stars),\nfor which the spectroscopic method of determining atmospheric parameters remains reliable. The sample is first analyzed by fitting the optical BV RI and\ninfrared JHK photometry using the method described in BLR and references\ntherein. Only Teff and the solid angle \u03c0(R/D)2 are considered free parameters,\nwhere (R/D) is the ratio of the radius of the star to its distance from Earth.\nThe distances are obtained from the trigonometric parallax measurements, and\nthe resulting radii are converted into masses using the evolutionary models of\nFontaine, et al. (2001) with thick hydrogen layers. Spectroscopic observations\nhave been secured for the DA stars in our sample using the Steward 2.3-m telescope equipped with the Boller & Chivens spectrograph. The high Balmer line\nspectra are fitted with a grid of model atmospheres following the procedure described in Bergeron, et al. (1992). The resulting Teff and log g values are then\nconverted into masses using the same evolutionary models as above.\n2.\n\nComparison of Spectroscopic and Photometric Stellar Parameters\n\nWe compare in Figure 1 (left panel) the spectroscopic and photometric temperatures for all 52 stars in our sample. The agreement between the spectroscopic\nand photometric temperatures for our sample is excellent, with the exception\nof WD 2329+267, a magnetic white dwarf whose line profiles exhibit strong\nZeeman splitting, WD 1606+422, a suspected double degenerate (BLR), and\nWD 1824+040, a confirmed double degenerate (Maxted & Marsh; 1999). The\ncomparison of spectroscopic and photometric masses for our 52 objects is displayed in Figure 1 (right panel). The vector shown in the figure indicates how\nthe masses would be affected if thin hydrogen layer models were used instead\nof thick hydrogen models to derive masses. For most objects the mass determinations yield significantly different results, as can be seen by the size of the\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBoudreault and Bergeron\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of the spectroscopic and photometric temperature\n(left panel ) and masses (right panels) for our 52 white dwarfs.\n\nuncertainties (cross in upper left corner). In general, the spectroscopic masses\nare larger than those inferred from photometry and trigonometric parallaxes.\nOne obvious exception is LHS 4033 near 1.35 M\u2299 , for which both estimates\nagree perfectly (see also Dahn et al.; 2004). Interestingly enough, there appears\nto be a large number of low mass (M < 0.5 M\u2299 ) stars in the photometric mass\ndistribution that is not observed in the spectroscopic distribution. This suggests that the low mass component may be contaminated by unresolved double\ndegenerates, which would appear as overluminous, and thus interpreted as low\nmass white dwarfs when analyzed with the photometric technique.\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of the spectroscopic and photometric masses for the\n13 objects below Mphot = 0.48 M\u2299 (circles) by assuming that two white dwarfs\nof equal temperatures and radii contribute to the total luminosity (triangles).\n\n3.\n\nUnresolved Double Degenerates\n\nIf we redo our analysis for the 13 objects below Mphot = 0.48 M\u2299 in Figure 1\nby assuming that two white dwarfs of equal temperatures and radii contribute\n\n\fComparison of White Dwarf Mass Determinations\n\n3\n\nto the total luminosity, we obtain the results shown in Figure 2. Of course, the\nspectroscopic mass determinations are not affected since both stars are assumed\nto be identical. We see that in most cases, but not all, it is possible to reconcile the spectroscopic and photometric masses. One of the objects in Figure\n2 is L870-2, a well-known double degenerate with almost identical atmospheric\nparameters.\n4.\n\nThe Presence of Helium in the Atmospheres of Cool DA Stars\n\nThe mass discrepancy for the DA stars in our sample can also be explained in\nterms of the presence of helium in the atmospheres of cool DA stars, brought\nto the surface by the hydrogen convection zone, and spectroscopically invisible\nat these low temperatures. Indeed, as demonstrated by Bergeron et al. (1990),\nthe presence of helium tends to increase the atmospheric pressure, which would\nbe interpreted as resulting from a high surface gravity (or high mass) when\nanalyzed with pure hydrogen models. To illustrate more quantitatively the ef-\n\nFigure 3. Comparison of the spectroscopic and photometric masses assuming a pure hydrogen atmosphere (circles) and a mixed composition of\nN (He)/N (H) = 1 (triangles).\n\nfect, we compare in Figure 3 the spectroscopic and photometric masses obtained\nunder the assumption of pure hydrogen atmospheres, as well as with a mixed\ncomposition of N (He)/N (H) = 1. While the photometric masses remain relatively unchanged, the spectroscopic masses are significantly reduced. Clearly,\nfor all objects, with the exception of some of the low mass stars, it is possible to\nreconcile the spectroscopic and photometric masses by adjusting the individual\nhelium abundance of each star. In the top panels of Figure 4, we compare the\nphotometric and spectroscopic solutions for LHS 3254 (WD 1655+215) under\nthe assumption of a pure hydrogen atmospheric composition. In the bottom\npanels, the helium abundance has been adjusted to ensure that the photometric\nand spectroscopic log g values (or masses) agree. We see that in this star, a\nhelium abundance of N (He)/N (H) = 0.63 is required to match the log g (or\nmass) determinations. Also, the photometric and spectroscopic temperatures\nagree even better when helium is included. Finally, the spectroscopic mass of\n0.50 M\u2299 inferred from the mixed He/H composition is in much better agreement\n\n\f4\n\nBoudreault and Bergeron\n\nFigure 4.

Helium abundances for individual objects will be presented\nelsewhere.\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe thus conclude that the existence of double degenerates, or the presence of\nhelium in the atmosphere of cool DA stars, or both, are responsible for the spectroscopic and photometric mass discrepancies observed in Figure 1. The presence of helium in cool DA stars will reduce the inferred spectroscopic masses and\nmay help resolve part of the problem with larger-than-average masses observed\nin spectroscopic analyses of DA stars at low temperatures.\nAcknowledgments.
