An elementary discussion\nof phase-damping channels shows the role of anti-linear operators in representing\ntheir concurrences. A general expression for some concurrences is derived. We apply\nit to 1-qubit channels of length two, getting the induced foliations of the state space,\nthe optimal decompositions, and the entropy of a state with respect to these\nchannels. For amplitude-damping channels one obtains an expression for the Holevo\ncapacity allowing for easy numerical calculations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this paper is in calculating some entanglement quantifying functions for a\nrather restricted class of quantum channels, in particular for all 1-qubit channels of\nlength two. These channels are now well examined and classified due to the work of\nFujiwara and Algoet [1], King and Ruskai [2], Ruskai et al [3], Verstraete and Verschelde\n[4]. They include all extremal 1-qubit channels and some important doubly stochastic\nones. An introduction to quantum channels is in Nielsen and Chuang, [5].\nA channel, say T , is of rank two, if T (\u03c1) is of rank two for all density operators. In this\ncase there are at most two eigenvalues of T (\u03c1) different from zero. It follows from trace\npreserving, that T (\u03c1) is characterized by its largest eigenvalue up to a general unitary\ntransformation. Nevertheless, the treatment of a general rank two channel is beyond our\npresent abilities if one asks for quantities like capacity or concurrence.\nA completely positive map is of length two, if it can be written down with two Kraus\noperators, but not with one.\nLet us now repeat some definitions and properties of the quantities to be treated. An\nensemble is a finite number of density operators, every one given with a definite\nprobability or weight,\nE = {\u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1m ; p1 , . . . , pm },\n(1)\nsuch that the sum of the positive numbers pj is one. The density operators are states of\na physical system. We may think of a quantum alphabet with quantum letters \u03c1j , and of\na quantum message which chooses randomly the quantum letter \u03c1j with probability pj .\nThe weighted sum of (1) is the average density of the ensemble,\nav[E] :=\n\nX\n\n1\n\npj \u03c1j\n\n(2)\n\n\fWhile the quantum letters of E are states of a physical system, the average (2) is a\n\"non-commutative probability measure\". Its role is quite similar to a \"classical\" discrete\nprobability distribution. The extractable information per quantum letter of the quantum\nmessage is bounded by Holevo's [6]\n\u03c7(E) := S(\u03c1) \u2212\n\nX\n\npj S(\u03c1j ) =\n\nX\n\npj S(\u03c1 k \u03c1j ),\n\n\u03c1 = av[E]\n\n(3)\n\nHere S(.) is the von Neumann entropy and S(. k .) the relative entropy.\nRemark 1:\n\nThe important inequality\n\n\u03c7(T (E)) \u2264 \u03c7(E)\nfollows from the monotonicity of relative entropy which can be proved for trace\npreserving, at least 2-positive maps. Counter examples for just positive maps seems to\nbe unknown. There are two recent reviews on the finer properties of relative entropy, one\nby Petz [7], going beyond complete positivity, and one by Ruskai [8].\nLet T be a positive trace preserving map acting on the density operators of H. The\napplication of \u03c1 \u2192 T (\u03c1) generates, letter by letter, a new quantum message belonging to\nthe new ensemble\nT (E) = {T (\u03c11 ), . . . , T (\u03c1m ); p1 , . . . , pm }\n(4)\nThe 1-shot or Holevo capacity of a channel T is the number\nC(1) (T ) := max \u03c7(T (E))\nE\n\n(5)\n\nWe are aiming at a slightly more delicate expression. To see its significance we try to\nperform (5) in two steps. At first we let E run only through the ensembles with a given\naverage density \u03c1, postponing the search for the maximum, i. e. the Holevo capacity, to a\nlater time. In doing so we first define\nH(T ; \u03c1) := max \u03c7(T (E))\nav[E]=\u03c1\n\n(6)\n\nso that the maximum is to compute with respect to all ensembles having \u03c1 as its average\ndensity. We get a function, depending on \u03c1 (and T ) only. If T is a partial trace onto a\nsub-algebra, (6) has been called entropy of \u03c1 with respect to the sub-algebra by Connes et\nal [9], see also Narnhofer and Thirring [10]. In this sense (6) could be called entropy of \u03c1\nwith respect to T .\nSchumacher and Westmoreland [11] relate (6) to the efficiency of quantum channels.\nThey denote the quantity in question by \u03c7\u2217 (\u03c1) and they call an ensemble saturating (6)\nan optimal signal ensemble.\nIt is important for our purposes to rewrite (6) by the help of (3) as\nH(T ; \u03c1) = S(T (\u03c1)) \u2212 E(T ; \u03c1)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere E is an entanglement measure given by\nE(T ; \u03c1) = P min\n\npk \u03c1k =\u03c1\n\nX\n\npj S(T (\u03c1j ))\n\n(8)\n\nand the minimum is to compute over all convex decompositions of \u03c1. If T is a partial\ntrace in a bipartite quantum system,(8) is the entanglement of formation introduced in\n2\n\n\fBennett et al [12], followed by the remarkable papers of Wootters, [13], and of Terhal\nand Vollbrecht [14]. Other examples are in Benatti et al [15], [16]. In [17] some relations\nbetween the quantity (8) for quite different channel maps are pointed out by the same\nauthors.\nIt is well known that E(T ; \u03c1) is convex in \u03c1. Indeed, E is written as the convex hull of\nthe function S(T (\u03c1)) in (8). The concavity of the entropy allows to perform (8) over the\npure decompositions of \u03c1 without changing the outcome of the minimization. Thus\nE(T ; \u03c1) = min\n\nX\n\npj S(T (\u03c0j )),\n\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\np j \u03c0j\n\n(9)\n\nwhere all the \u03c0k are pure and the minimum is to perform with respect to all pure\ndecompositions of \u03c1. An ensemble of pure states saturating (9) will be called an optimal\nensemble.\nOne should also notice: The equality between the two variational problems (8) and (9) is\ndue to the concavity of S(T (\u03c1)). If we perform similar computations, however with a\nfunction not being concave, the two problems are essentially different. For certain\nchannels, including all rank two and length two 1-qubit channels, the minimization (9)\nwill be solved in the present paper.\nThe next section is a short introduction to the roof concept. We shall discuss how to\nestimate (9) from below by convex functions and from above by roofs.\nNext we demonstrate the procedure for the phase-damping channels, where most things\nare now well understood. It follows the computation of concurrences and of E for some\nrank two channels. We give quite explicit computations to see the dependence of\nconcurrences, foliations, and optimal ensembles from the Kraus operators.\nA quite interesting observation is the following: Let us call Kraus module of T the linear\nspan of the Kraus operators of T . Choi [18] has shown that irreducibility of trace\npreserving cp-maps is a sole property of the Kraus module. Here we prove for length two\nand rank two channel maps that their optimal ensembles and, hence, their foliations are\nequal if they belong to the same Kraus module. It is not probable that this remarkable\nfeature will survive for more complex channels. Nevertheless it seems worthwhile to ask\nfor similarities of channels with identical Kraus modules.\nIt is a further consequence from our calculations that the foliations deform continuously\nby changing the entries of the Kraus operators for the class of channels considered. The\nfoliations are more coarse properties of rank two cp-maps than concurrences.\n\n2\n\nRoofs\n\nThere are some general features in the optimization problems we are interested on. They\nconstitute the ground floor for more refined investigations.\nLet us abstract from the specific values given at the pure states in (9) and let us start\nwith an arbitrary real valued and continuous function g(\u03c0) on the set of pure states.\nAssume, we like to extend g to a function defined for all density matrices. Clearly, there\nare many and quite arbitrary solutions for the problem. Let us denote by G one of these\nextension.\n\n3\n\n\fTo place a first restriction, we require the extension to be \"as linear as possible\". The\nrequirement can be made precise as following. Let \u03c1 be a density operator. If there exist\na pure decomposition of \u03c1 such that\nX\n\nG(\u03c1) =\n\npj g(\u03c0j ),\n\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\n(10)\n\np j \u03c0j ,\n\nwe call the decomposition \u03c1-optimal or simply optimal for G. We also call a pure\nensemble\nE = {\u03c01 , . . . , \u03c0m ; p1 , . . . , pm }, pj > 0,\nG-optimal if\nX\n\nG(\n\np j \u03c0j ) =\n\nX\n\npj G(\u03c0j )\n\nA function, G, which allows an optimal decomposition (10) for every state \u03c1, I call a roof\nor, more literally, a roof extension of g. Roof extensions reflect the convex structure of\nthe state space and they are, in a well defined way, \"as linear as possible\". It is not easy\nto gain good examples of roof extensions in higher dimensions. In general, however,\nthere are a lot of them for a given function g.\nLet us now consider two further possibilities to extend g from the pure ones to all states:\nWe may require the extension to be either concave or convex. In this spirit we call a\nfunction on the state space a convex extension of g if the extension is a convex function.\nSimilar we speak of a concave extension of g if the extension is concave.\nLemma 1.\n\nGiven a convex, a concave, and a roof extensions of g. Then\nGconvex (\u03c1) \u2264 Groof (\u03c1) \u2264 Gconcave (\u03c1)\n\n(11)\n\nfor all density operators \u03c1.\nThe proof is almost trivial: One chooses a \u03c1-optimal decomposition (10). Then the very\ndefinition of a convex (concave) function establishes (11).\nIt follows that, given g, there can be only one convex roof extension, \"the\" convex roof\ndetermined by g. The family of roof extensions of g has just one member in common\nwith the family of its convex extensions. Similarly there is just one concave roof which\nextends g.\nAs a matter of fact [19], the convex roof with values g(\u03c0) at the pure states is nothing\nthan the solution of the variational problem which mimics (9).\nGconvex,roof (\u03c1) = min\n\nX\n\npj g(\u03c0j ),\n\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\np j \u03c0j\n\n(12)\n\nHere one has to run through all pure state decompositions of \u03c1. We get (9) by setting\ng(\u03c0) = S(T (\u03c0)) for pure \u03c0. On the other hand, if we take the maximum in (12) instead\nof the minimum, we obtain the concave roof extension of g.\nLet us return for a moment to the more specific of evaluating (9). To calculate E(T \u03c1)\namounts to construct the convex roof with the function g(\u03c0) = S(T (\u03c0)). Looking at the\nroof property, there are some typical questions one should ask. For instance we may\nstart by a set of parameterized mappings, Ts , and we like to know whether they have,\nperhaps for some \u03c1, identical optimal decompositions. More literally, we ask for a pure\ndecomposition of \u03c1 which is optimal for every Ts in an appropriate range of the\n\n4\n\n\fparameter s. In the next sections we like to convince the reader that this point of view is\nquite fruitful. To do so, a remarkable property of convex and concave roofs is to explain.\nLet G be a convex roof on the density operators of a Hilbert space of finite dimension d.\nAt first we use convexity: Let us fix a density operator \u03c1. There is at least one\nHermitian operator, say Y \u03c1 , such that for all density operators \u03c9\nG(\u03c1) = Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c1,\n\nG(\u03c9) \u2265 Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c9\n\n(13)\n\nis valid. Now let us apply the roof property: There is a pure decomposition\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\np j \u03c0j ,\n\npj > 0,\n\n\u03c0j pure,\n\nwhich is G-optimal. Thus\nX\n\npj Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c0j = Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c1 = G(\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\npj G(\u03c0j )\n\nBecause of the inequality (13) this can hold if and only if\nG(\u03c0j ) = Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c0j ,\n\nj = 1, 2, . . .\n\nLet us now look at the convex set\n{ \u03c9 : G(\u03c9) = Tr Y \u03c1 \u03c9 }\n\n(14)\n\nBy the very construction, G is convexly linear (affine) if restricted to this set. On the\nother hand, it contains \u03c1 and, by the reasoning above, it contains every pure state which\nbelongs to a G-optimal ensemble with average density \u03c1. Or, in other words, (14)\ncontains all the pure states which can appear in an optimal decomposition of \u03c1. Let us\ncollect all that in a theorem, [15], [19].\nTheorem 2. Let g be a continuous function on the pure states.\ni) There exist exactly one convex roof extension, G, of g.\nii) G can be represented by the optimization procedure (12).\niii) There exist optimal pure decompositions for every density operator \u03c1.\niv) Given \u03c1, G is convexly linear on the convex hull of all those pure states which can\nappear in an optimal decomposition of \u03c1.\nLet us call the convex hull of all pure states appearing in all possible optimal pure\ndecompositions of \u03c1 the optimal convex leaf of \u03c1. As proved above, and stated in the\ntheorem, G must be convexly linear on every optimal convex leaf.\nRemark 2. The remark concerns property iii). The compact convex set of density\noperators enjoys a peculiarity: The set of their extremal points, i. e. the set of pure\nstates, is a compact one. This allows to prove the existence of optimal decompositions\n(10) by the continuity of g. Then, by a theorem due to Caratheodory, one deduces the\nexistence of optimal decompositions with a length not exceeding d2 , d the dimension of\nthe Hilbert space which carries the density operators. It should be noticed that the\ncompactness of the extremal points is an extra property. Counter examples are by no\nmeans exotic as seen by the set of trace preserving cp-maps. To get the conclusion iii) it\nsuffices for g to be continuously extendable to the closure of the set of extremal states.\nRemark 3. If G is a convex roof and G is the sum of two convex functions G = G1 + G2 ,\nthen G1 and G2 are convex roofs, and every G-optimal ensemble is optimal for G1 and\nG2 .\n5\n\n\fWe need one more definition: We call a convex roof, G, flat if it allows for every \u03c1 an\noptimal pure decomposition\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\np j \u03c0j ,\n\nG(\u03c1) =\n\nX\n\npj G(\u03c0j )\n\nsuch that\nG(\u03c01 ) = G(\u03c02 ) = . . . = G(\u03c0j ) = . . .\nIf this takes place, every \u03c1 is contained in a convex subset, generated by pure states, on\nwhich the roof is not only convexly linear but even constant. The merit of flat roof, say\nG, is in the nice property that every function of G, say f (G), is again a roof.\nAs a matter or fact, the convex roofs we are considering in the following enjoy even a\nstronger property: They are constant on the convex leaf of every \u03c1, i. e. g is constant on\nthe pure states of every pure ensemble which is optimal for G.\n\n3\n\nPhase damping channels\n\nLet us consider some particularly simple examples of 1-qubit channels, the family of\nphase-damping channels. to see what is going on in applying concurrences, [13], to\n1-qubit channels according to [20]. For the most symmetric channel of the family, with\nz = 0 in (15), the theorem below and the insight into the foliation of the state space are\ndue to Levitin [21].\nLet |z| < 1 be a complex number. Define the map Tz by\nX=\n\n\u0012\n\nx00\nx10\n\nx01\nx11\n\n\u0013\n\n7\u2192 Tz (X) =\n\n\u0012\n\nx00\nz \u2217 x10\n\nzx01\nx11\n\n\u0013\n\n(15)\n\nThe application of such a map does not change the pure states |0ih0| and |1ih1|, and\nthere are no other trace preserving and completely positive 1-qubit maps with this\nproperty than those given by (15).\nBefore starting the calculation let us have a look on a bundle of parallel lines which\nfoliates the state space. Geometrically, the 1-qubit state space can be represented by the\nBloch ball. The Bloch ball is the unit ball sitting in the \"Bloch space\", that is in the real\nEuclidean 3-space of all Hermitian matrices of trace one. The \"Pauli coordinates\", xj , of\na matrix are read off from\nX=\n\n1\n(x0 1 + x1 \u03c31 + x2 \u03c32 + x3 \u03c33 )\n2\n\nWith x0 = 1 the real coordinates x1 , x2 , x3 , parameterize the Bloch space, and in this\ncontext they are referred to as \"Bloch coordinates\". Finally, the Bloch ball is the unit\nball with respect to the Bloch coordinates.\nLet us return to the phase-damping channels. The line x1 = x2 = 0, i. e. the x3 -axis,\nremains point-wise fixed under the mappings (15). On the intersection of the line with\nthe Bloch ball E(Tz ; \u03c1) must be zero. One aim is to show that E(Tz ; \u03c1) is constant on\nthe intersection of the Bloch ball with every line which is parallel to the line x1 = x2 = 0.\nThese lines are given by fixing the values of x1 and x2 and letting x3 free. Equivalently,\n\n6\n\n\fsuch a line can be given by fixing x01 in (15). Now we can write down a very simple\nconvex roof, the restriction of the function\nX 7\u2192\n\nq\n\nx21 + x22 \u2261 2 |x01 |\n\nonto the state space. Indeed, this function is convex on the Bloch space. It is even a\nsemi-norm there. And it is, trivially, a flat roof: It is constant on every line parallel to\nthe x3 -axis of the Bloch space. The intersection of a given line with the Bloch ball is\neither empty, or touching the ball in just one point, or is a line segment with two pure\nstates as end points. In the latter case, the pure states of the segment are\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 p x01\nx10\np\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u0012\n\np\nx10\n\nx01\n1\u2212p\n\n\u0013\n\np(1 \u2212 p) = |x01 |2\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nwith 2|x01 | < 1. For 2|x01 | = 1 the line touches the Bloch ball at one pure state.\n\nWith a flat roof one can build other roofs just by taking a function of it: If f is a real\nfunction on the unit interval, f (|x01 |) is again a flat roof. By an appropriate choice of f\nwe shall find the form of E(Tz ; \u03c1).\nTo do so we need to compute the determinant\ndet Tz (X) = x00 x11 \u2212 zz \u2217 x01 x10 = det X + (1 \u2212 zz \u2217 )x01 x10\nTaking X pure, say xjk = aj a\u2217k , only the second term is different from zero and we\nremain with\ndet Tz (X) = (1 \u2212 |z|2 )|a0 a1 |2 , xjk = aj a\u2217k\n\n(17)\n\nUsing ideas from [13] and [22] we define the concurrence of Tz for Hermitian X by\nC(Tz ; X) :=\n\nq\n\n(1 \u2212 |z|2 ) (x21 + x22 )\n\n(18)\n\nThe definition differs from the one used in [20] by a factor two. It influences, here and\nlater on, the appearance of some equations. The concurrence is a semi-norm on the\nBloch ball, and, if restricted to the Bloch ball, it is the unique convex roof satisfying\nq\n\nC(Tz ; \u03c0) = 2 det Tz (\u03c0),\n\n\u03c0 pure\n\n(19)\n\nFollowing again [12] and [13] we introduce\nh(x) = \u2212x log x \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) log(1 \u2212 x)\nand, using ad hoc notations,\nh1 (x) = h(\n\n1+x\n)\n2\n\nand\nh2 (x) = h1 (y),\nTheorem 3.\n\ny=\n\np\n\n1 \u2212 x2\n\nFor all |z| < 1 and all density operators \u03c1\nE(Tz ; \u03c1) = h2 ( C(Tz ; \u03c1) )\n\n(20)\n\nholds. It is E(\u03c11 ) = E(\u03c12 ) for two density operators, \u03c11 and \u03c12 , if and only if they have\nequal distances to the x3 -axis of the Bloch space. The pairs of optimal pure states are\ngiven by (16).\n7\n\n\fProof: We already know that (20) is a roof with the desired values at the pure states. We\nonly have to show that it is convex. Then, by the uniqueness theorem, we are done. One\ncalculates the first and the second derivative of h2 , assuming log \u2261 ln. At first we get\nh\u20322 (x) =\n\n1+y\nx\nln\n2y 1 \u2212 y\n\nFor x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0 we find h\u20322 \u2265 0. One further obtains\nh\u2032\u20322 (x) =\n\n1 y3 y5 y7\n+\n+\n+\n+ ...\n3\n5\n7\n9\n\nand h\u2032\u20322 \u2265 0 proves the convexity of h2 . Let C(\u03c1) be a convex function on the state space\n( - or on another convex set - ) with values between 0 and 1. Let us denote by a dot the\ndifferentiation of C in an arbitrary direction. Then\nh2 (C)** = h\u2032\u20322 (C)\u010a \u010a + h\u20322 (C)C\u0308\nBy the convexity of C one gets C\u0308 \u2265 0, and we have seen h\u2032 \u2265 0 on the unit interval.\nThus, the second term is not negative. As we know h\u2032\u2032 \u2265 0, we have shown the convexity\nof the function (20), and we done.\nLemma 4. Let C be a convex function with values in the unit interval, defined on a\nfinite dimensional convex set. Then h2 (C) is convex.\nIt is remarkable that the whole set of phase damping channels induces a single foliation\nof the state space: The foliation is a property of the Kraus module belonging to the\nchannels. The single foliation forces the concurrences to differ by a factor only if z is\nchanging.\nNow we have to add a further structural element as a guide in treating more general\n1-qubit channels. What we have in mind is, up to a contracting factor, a reflection on\nthe plane z3 = 0. In Bloch space a reflection is not a proper rotation. Its functional\ndeterminant must be negative, enforcing its implementation by an anti-linear operator in\nthe 1-qubit space. The anti-linearity is unavoidable.\nLet us define an anti-linear operator \u03b8z by\n\u03b8z\n\n\u0012\n\na0\na1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012 \u2217\u0013\n\u221a\na1\n\u2217\n= 1 \u2212 zz\na\u22170\n\n(21)\n\nThe operator is an Hermitian one, i. e. it satisfies\nh\u03c61 |\u03b8z |\u03c62 i = h\u03c62 |\u03b8z |\u03c61 i\nfor all pairs of vectors. Being anti-linear, \u03b8 acts to the right, but not to the left. With\ntwo arbitrary vectors,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\na0\nb0\n|ai =\n, |bi =\n,\na1\nb1\nwe get the following relation.\nha|\u03b8z |bi =\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 zz \u2217 (a0 b1 + a1 b0 )\u2217\n\n(22)\n\nIn combination with (17) we obtain the equation\n4 det Tz (|aiha|) = | ha|\u03b8z |ai |2\n8\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhich, together with (19), can be written\nC(Tz ; |aiha|) = | ha|\u03b8z |ai |\n\n(24)\n\nBecause the concurrence is a convex roof, we can now return to one of the properties of\nsuch function:\nX\nC(Tz ; \u03c1) = min\npj | h\u03c6j |\u03b8z |\u03c6j i |\n(25)\nwhere the minimum runs through all possible ways of representing \u03c1 as a convex\ncombination\nX\n\u03c1=\npj |\u03c6j ih\u03c6j |\n\nThe minimum will be attained by choosing the decomposition with a pair (16) of pure\nstates. With the same optimal decomposition of \u03c1 the optimization problem for E(Tz ; \u03c1)\ncan be saturated. (The diagonal entries of \u03c1 must 1/2.)\nRemark 4. Let us assume we like to solve for the phase-damping channels the\nvariational problems (8), but we like to replace the minimization by the maximization,\nresulting in concave roofs. Now the foliation for the maximization is given by the\nintersection of the planes perpendicular to the x3 -axis with the Bloch ball. The foliation\nis the same for all z. The intersection of a plane with a ball contains a whole circle of\nextremal states. Hence there are very many different optimal decompositions for given\nmixed \u03c1.\n\n4\n\nConcurrence\n\nLet us now discuss some generalities for rank two channels and let us see, where the\ndifficulties are. A quantum channel, T , is of rank k if the maximal rank of all pictures,\nT (\u03c1), is k.\nLet T be of rank two. We assume in addition that T maps into a 1-qubit space. Then\nthe determinant of T (\u03c1) is the product of the eigenvalues of T (\u03c1). We define the\nconcurrence, C(T ; \u03c1), of T to be the convex roof which attains at pure states the values\nq\n\nC(T ; \u03c0) = 2 det Tz (\u03c0),\n\n\u03c0 pure\n\n(26)\n\ncompletely similar to (19). Being convex with values between 0 and 1, we can literally\nrepeat the construction as in (20). The result is a convex function which coincides at\npure states with E. But in general we do not know, wether (26) is a flat roof. Hence, we\nonly can conclude\nE(T ; \u03c1) \u2265 h2 ( C(T ; \u03c1) )\n(27)\nIf, however, (26) is a flat roof, then the right hand side of (26) is a flat convex roof and\nwe have two convex roofs agreeing on pure states. Then equality must hold.\nLemma 5. If C as given by (26) is a convex roof, then we have\nC flat \u21d2 E(T ; \u03c1) = h2 ( C(T ; \u03c1) )\nIt is useful to know whether the concurrence of a channel map T is a flat roof. The\nfollowing theorem gives a whole class of them.\n9\n\n(28)\n\n\fTheorem 6. Let \u03b8 be an anti-linear hermitian operator and define C\u03b8 as the convex\nroof extension of\nC\u03b8 (|\u03c6ih\u03c6|) = | h\u03c6|\u03b8|\u03c6i |\n(29)\nfor all pure states \u03c0. Then the convex roof C\u03b8 is flat. It is\nC\u03b8 (\u03c1) = max{ 0, \u03bb1 \u2212\n\nX\n\nj>1\n\n\u03bbj }\n\n(30)\n\nwhere \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . are the ordered eigenvalues of\n( \u03c11/2 \u03b8\u03c1\u03b8\u03c11/2 )1/2\nCorollary 7.\n\nIf there exists an anti-linear hermitian \u03b8 such that\n4 det T (\u03c0) = Tr \u03c0\u03b8\u03c0\u03b8,\n\n\u03c0 pure\n\n(31)\n\nis valid for all pure density operators then\nC\u03b8 (\u03c1) = C(T ; \u03c1)\n\n(32)\n\nis a flat roof and (28) is valid.\nThis theorem is proved in [22]. It provides a certain application of the methods of\nWootters and others, see Wootters [23]. As already mentioned, with T the partial trace,\nE(T ; \u03c1) is the entanglement of formation. In the 2-qubit system \u03b8 is the Hill-Wootters\nconjugation.\nFor 1-qubit maps (30) reads \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 and one can become more explicit. Abbreviate\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n\u03be = (\u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c11 )1/2\nTaking the trace of the characteristic equation of \u03be results in\nTr \u03be 2 + 2 det \u03be = (Tr \u03be)2\nand the squared sum of the eigenvalues of \u03be becomes\n(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 )2 = Tr (\u03c11 \u03c12 ) + 2 det \u03be\nCombined with the relation\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2 = (\u03bb1 + \u03bb2 )2 \u2212 4 det \u03be\nit yields\nq\n\n(\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )2 = Tr (\u03c11 \u03c12 ) \u2212 2 (det \u03c11 )(det \u03c12 )\nSubstituting \u03c11 = \u03c1 and \u03c12 = \u03b8\u03c1\u03b8 provides, [22],\n\u221a\nC\u03b8 (\u03c1)2 = Tr (\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03b8) \u2212 2(det \u03c1) det \u03b82\n\n10\n\n(33)\n\n\f5\n\n1-qubit channels of length two\n\nIn this section we like to show that the corollary to the preceding theorem applies to\n1-qubit channels of length two. As we shall see, the existence of an anti-linear hermitian\n\u03b8 fulfilling (31) does not depend on trace preserving.\nLet A and B be two linear independent operators on a 2-dimensional Hilbert space and\nA=\n\n\u0012\n\na00\na10\n\na01\na11\n\n\u0013\n\nB=\n\n,\n\n\u0012\n\nb00\nb10\n\nb01\nb11\n\n\u0013\n\ntheir matrix representations with respect to a reference basis.\nT (X) = AXA\u2020 + BXB \u2020\n\n(34)\n\nis a completely positive map of length two. The following has been proved in [20] by\nstraight forward computation.\nTheorem 8.\nstates\n\nThere is an anti-linear hermitian operator \u03b8A,B such that for all pure\n4 det T (|aiha|) = | ha|\u03b8A,B |bi |2\n\nwhere T is given by (34).\nIf such an operator exists, it is determined by T up to a phase factor only. The\nambiguity is a natural one due to a geometric phase.\nTo describe \u03b8 one can introduce its matrix representation\n\u03b8A,B\n\n\u0012\n\na0\na1\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b100 a\u22170 + \u03b101 a\u22171\n\u03b110 a\u22170 + \u03b111 a\u22171\n\n\u0013\n\n(35)\n\nand express the matrix elements by those of A and B.\n\u03b100 = 2(b10 a00 \u2212 a10 b00 )\u2217 ,\n\n\u03b111 = 2(a01 b11 \u2212 b01 a11 )\u2217 ,\n\n\u03b101 = \u03b110 = (a00 b11 \u2212 a11 b00 + a01 b10 \u2212 a10 b01 )\u2217\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\nUp to a factor, due to another normalization of the concurrence, this is agreement with\n[20]. Clearly, \u03b8 must be skew symmetric in the matrix entries of the Krause operators,\n\u03b8A,B + \u03b8B,A = 0.\nComparing the equations above with phase-damping channels one gets \u03b8A,B = \u2212\u03b8z .\n\nOne may expect a more transparent representation than (36) and (37). This is possible\nby the spin-flip operator \u03b8f , the \"fermion conjugation\" for one qubit,\n\u03b8f\n\n\u0012\n\na0\na1\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\na\u22171\n\u2212a\u22170\n\n\u0013\n\nAfter calculating\n\u2020\n\nA \u03b8f B =\n\n\u0012\n\n(b10 a00 \u2212 a10 b00 )\u2217\n(a01 b10 \u2212 a11 b00 )\u2217\n11\n\n(a00 b11 \u2212 a10 b01 )\u2217\n(a01 b11 \u2212 a11 b01 )\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\n\fand comparing that expression with (36) and (37), we get\n\u03b8A,B = A\u2020 \u03b8f B \u2212 B \u2020 \u03b8f A\n\n(38)\n\nRemember \u03b8f\u2020 = \u2212\u03b8f = \u03b8f\u22121 to see that (38) is an anti-linear hermitian operator \u2013 as it\nshould be.

It shows that our procedure associates, up to a scalar factor, to\nevery pair of operators, chosen from the linear span of A and B, the same anti-linear\noperator. With other words, to every 2-dimensional Kraus module a 1-dimensional linear\nspace of anti-linear hermitian operators is attached.\nRemark 5. Regard the Kraus modules for the 1-qubit channels as the points of the\nsecond Grassmann manifold of the space of linear operators. By attaching the multiples\nof \u03b8A,B to the corresponding points one gets the line bundle. It is dual to the\ndeterminant bundle as one can deduce from what follows.

Geometrically, the\npoints of constant concurrence and, hence, of E are ellipse-based cylinders.\nIn the non-degenerate case none of the two linear forms vanish identically. The foliation\nof the state space at which the concurrence and also E(T ; \u03c1) remain constant are given\n13\n\n\fby the straight lines which are the intersection of the two families of planes L1 =\nconstant, L2 = constant', in the Bloch space. There is just one straight line at which the\nconcurrence is zero. It goes through the two pure states which are mapped onto pure\nstates by T . Up to normalization these two pure states belong to the vectors\n\u0012\n\na0\na1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nb10 a00 a20 = b01 a11 a21\n\nThey are mapped by T to vector states of the form\n\u0012\n\na\u20320\na\u20321\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nb10 a11 (a\u20320 )2 = b01 a00 (a\u20321 )2 = 0\n\nLet us now shortly look at the degenerate case in which b01 b10 is zero in (45). The\namplitude-damping channels are well known examples. They can be defined by the\nKraus operators\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\u2212p\n0\n1 0\n, B=\n(51)\nA=\n\u221a\np\n0\n0\n0\nwith 0 < p < 1.

The foliation dictates the behavior of C(T ; \u03c1) and E(T ; \u03c1).\nOne observes that, given \u03c111 , the entropy S(T (\u03c1)) becomes maximal if the off diagonal\nentries of \u03c1 vanish. Therefore, if \u03c1\u2032 is the diagonal part of \u03c1, We get\nE(T ; \u03c1) = E(T ; \u03c1\u2032 ),\n\nH(T ; \u03c1) \u2264 H(T ; \u03c1\u2032 )\n\nand to obtain the Holevo capacity it suffices to consider diagonal density operators only:\nC(1) = max H(T ; \u03c1\u2032 ),\n\n\u03c1\u2032 diagonal\n\nWriting r for \u03c111 , such that 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, we can rewrite the capacity as follows:\nC\n\n(1)\n\n(T ) = max [h(pr) \u2212 h(\n0\u2264r\u22641\n\n1\u2212\n\np\n\n1 \u2212 4p(1 \u2212 p)r 2\n)]\n2\n\n(53)\n\nBecause H(T ; \u03c1) is a concave function, (53) is a concave function of r and, obviously, not\ndegenerate. Therefore, for any given 0 < p < 1, there is exactly one value r0 of r at\nwhich the maximum in (53) is attained.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Fujiwara, P. Algoet, Phys.Rev. A, 59 3290 (1998)\n[2] Ch.
