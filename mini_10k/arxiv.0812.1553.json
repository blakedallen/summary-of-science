I NTRODUCTION\nNext generation wireless systems will be designed to provide high-data-rate communications anytime,\nanywhere in a reliable and robust fashion while making efficient use of resources. This wireless vision will\nenable mobile multimedia communications. Indeed, one of the features of fourth generation (4G) wireless\nsystems is the ability to support multimedia services at low transmission cost [31, Chap. 23, available\nonline]. However, before this vision is realized, many technical challenges have to be addressed. In most\nwireless systems, spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are important considerations. Especially in mobile\napplications, energy resources are scarce and have to be conserved. Additionally, supporting quality of\nservice (QoS) guarantees is one of the key requirements in the development of next generation wireless\ncommunication networks. For instance, in real-time services like multimedia video conference and live\nbroadcast of sporting events, the key QoS metric is delay. In such cases, information has to be communicated\nwith minimal delay. Satisfying the QoS requirements is especially challenging in wireless systems because\nchannel conditions and hence, for instance, the data rates at which reliable communication can be established,\nvary randomly over time due to mobility and changing environment. Under such volatile conditions, providing\ndeterministic QoS guarantees either is not possible or, when it is possible, requires the system to operate\noverly pessimistically and achieve low performance underutilizing the resources. Hence, supporting statistical\nQoS guarantees is better suited to wireless systems. In summary, the central issue in wireless systems is to\nprovide the best performance levels while satisfying the statistical QoS constraints and making efficient use\nof resources.\nInformation theory provides the ultimate performance limits and identifies the most efficient use of\nresources. Due to this fact, wireless fading channels have been extensively studied from an informationtheoretic point of view, considering different assumptions on the availability of the channel side information\n(CSI) at the receiver and transmitter (see [1] and references therein). As also noted above, efficient use\nof limited energy resources is of paramount importance in most wireless systems. From an informationtheoretic perspective, the energy required to reliably send one bit is a metric that can be adopted to measure\nthe energy efficiency. Generally, energy-per-bit requirement is minimized, and hence the energy efficiency\nis maximized, if the system operates in the low-power or wideband regime. Recently, Verd\u00fa in [2] has\n1\n\n\fdetermined the minimum bit energy required for reliable communications over a general class of channels,\nand studied the spectral efficiency\u2013bit energy tradeoff in the wideband regime. This work has provided a\nquantitative analysis of the energy-bandwidth tradeoff.\nWhile providing powerful results, information-theoretic studies generally do not address delay and QoS\nconstraints [3]. For instance, results on the channel capacity give insights on the performance levels achieved\nwhen the blocklength of codes becomes large [28]. The impact upon the queue length and queueing delay of\ntransmission using codes with large blocklength can be significant. Situation is even further exacerbated in\nwireless channels in which the ergodic capacity has an operational meaning only if the codewords are long\nenough to span all fading states. Now, we also have dependence on fading, and in slow fading environments,\nlarge delays can be experienced in order to achieve the ergodic capacity. Due to these considerations,\nperformance metrics such as capacity versus outage [4] and delay limited capacity [5] have been considered\nin the literature for slow fading scenarios. For a given outage probability constraint, outage capacity gives\nthe maximum transmission rate that satisfies the outage constraint. Delay-limited capacity is defined as the\noutage capacity associated with zero outage probability, and is a performance level that can be attained\nregardless of the values of the fading states. Hence, delay limited capacity can be seen as a deterministic\nservice guarantee. However, delay limited capacity can be low or even zero, for instance in Rayleigh fading\nchannels even if both the receiver and transmitter has perfect channel side information.\nMore recently, delay constraints are more explicitly considered and their impact on communication over\nfading channels is analyzed in [7] and [8]. In these studies, the tradeoff between the average transmission\npower and average delay is identified. More specifically, the authors investigated optimal transmission and\npower adaptation policies that take into account arrival state, buffer occupancy, channel state jointly together\nand have the goal of minimizing the average transmission power subject to average delay constraints.\nIn this paper, we follow a different approach, and consider statistical QoS constraints and study the energy\nefficiency under such limitations. For this analysis, we employ the notion of effective capacity [13], which\ncan be seen as the maximum throughput that can be achieved by the given energy levels while providing\nstatistical QoS guarantees. Effective capacity formulation uses the large deviations theory and incorporates\nthe statistical QoS constraints by capturing the rate of decay of the buffer occupancy probability for large\n2\n\n\fqueue lengths. In this paper, to measure the energy efficiency, we consider the bit energy which is defined\nas the average energy normalized by the effective capacity. We investigate the attainable bit energy levels\nin the low-power and wideband regimes. For constant source arrival rates, our analysis provides a tradeoff\ncharacterization between the energy and delay.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly discusses the system model. Section\nIII reviews the concept of effective capacity with statistical QoS guarantees, and the spectral efficiency-bit\nenergy tradeoff. In Section IV, energy efficiency in the low-power regime is analyzed. Section V investigates\nthe energy efficiency in the wideband regime. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nWe consider a point-to-point communication system in which there is one source and one destination.\nThe general system model is depicted in Fig.1, and is similar to the one studied in [17]. In this model, it\nis assumed that the source generates data sequences which are divided into frames of duration T . These\ndata frames are initially stored in the buffer before they are transmitted over the wireless channel. The\ndiscrete-time channel input-output relation in the ith symbol duration is given by\ny[i] = h[i]x[i] + n[i]\n\ni = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x[i] and y[i] denote the complex-valued channel input and output, respectively. The channel input is\nsubject to an average power constraint E{|x[i]|2 } \u2264 P\u0304 for all i, and we assume that the bandwidth available\nin the system is B. Above, n[i] is a zero-mean, circularly symmetric, complex Gaussian random variable with\nvariance E{|n[i]|2 } = N0 . The additive Gaussian noise samples {n[i]} are assumed to form an independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence. Finally, h[i] denotes the channel fading coefficient, and {h[i]}\nis a stationary and ergodic discrete-time process. We assume that perfect channel state information (CSI)\nis available at the receiver while the transmitter has either no or perfect CSI. The availability of CSI at\nthe transmitter is facilitated through CSI feedback from the receiver. Note that if the transmitter knows\nthe channel fading coefficients, it employs power and rate adaptation. Otherwise, the signals are sent with\nconstant power.\n\n3\n\n\fNote that in the above system model, the average transmitted signal-to-noise ratio is\n\nSNR\n\n= P\u0304 /(N0 B).\n\nWe denote the magnitude-square of the fading coefficient by z[i] = |h[i]|2 , and its distribution function by\npz (z). When there is only receiver CSI, instantaneous transmitted power is P [i] = P\u0304 and the instantaneous\nreceived\n\nSNR\n\nis expressed as \u03b3[i] = P\u0304 z[i]/(N0 B). Moreover, the maximum instantaneous service rate R[i]\n\nis\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR[i] = B log2 1 + SNRz[i]\n\nbits/s.\n\n(2)\n\nWe note that although the transmitter does not know z[i], recently developed rateless codes such as LT [24]\nand Raptor [25] codes enable the transmitter to adapt its rate to the channel realization and achieve R[i]\nwithout requiring CSI at the transmitter side [26], [27].\nWhen also the transmitter has CSI, the instantaneous service rate is\nR[i] = B log2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1 + \u03bcopt (\u03b8, z[i])z[i]\n\nbits/s.\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bcopt (\u03b8, z) is the optimal power-adaptation policy.

P RELIMINARIES\n\nIn this section, we briefly explain the notion of effective capacity and also describe the spectral efficiencybit energy tradeoff. We refer the reader to [13] and [14] for more detailed exposition of the effective capacity.\n\n4\n\n\fA. Effective Capacity\nSatisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements is crucial for the successful deployment and operation\nof most communication networks. Hence, in the networking literature, how to handle and satisfy QoS\nconstraints has been one of the key considerations for many years. In addressing this issue, the theory\nof effective bandwidth of a time-varying source has been developed to identify the minimum amount of\ntransmission rate that is needed to satisfy the statistical QoS requirements (see e.g., [9], [10], [11], and [29]).\nIn wireless communications, the instantaneous channel capacity varies randomly depending on the channel\nconditions. Hence, in addition to the source, the transmission rates for reliable communication are also\ntime-varying. The time-varying channel capacity can be incorporated into the theory of effective bandwidth\nby regarding the channel service process as a time-varying source with negative rate and using the source\nmultiplexing rule ([29, Example 9.2.2]). Using a similar approach, Wu and Negi in [13] defined the effective\ncapacity as a dual concept to effective bandwidth. The effective capacity provides the maximum constant\narrival rate2 that a given time-varying service process can support while satisfying a QoS requirement\nspecified by \u03b8. If we define Q as the stationary queue length, then \u03b8 is the decay rate of the tail distribution\nof the queue length:\nlog P (Q \u2265 q)\n= \u2212\u03b8.\nq\u2192\u221e\nq\nlim\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, for large qmax , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability: P (Q \u2265\nqmax ) \u2248 e\u2212\u03b8qmax . Hence, while larger \u03b8 corresponds to more strict QoS constraints, smaller \u03b8 implies looser\nQoS guarantees. Similarly, if D denotes the steady-state delay experienced in the buffer, then P (D \u2265 dmax ) \u2248\ne\u2212\u03b8\u03b4dmax for large dmax , where \u03b4 is determined by the arrival and service processes [20]. The analysis and\napplication of effect capacity in various settings has attracted much interest recently (see e.g., [14]\u2013[21]).\nLet {R[i], i = 1, 2, . . .} denote the discrete-time stationary and ergodic stochastic service process and\nP\nS[t] , ti=1 R[i] be the time-accumulated process.

Spectral Efficiency vs. Bit Energy\nIn [2], Verd\u00fa has extensively studied the spectral efficiency\u2013bit energy tradeoff in the wideband regime.\nIn this work, the minimum bit energy required for reliable communication over a general class of multipleinput multiple-output channels is identified. In general, if the capacity is a concave function of SNR, then the\nminimum bit energy is achieved as\n\nSNR\n\n\u2192 0. Additionally, Verd\u00fa has defined the wideband slope, which\n\nis the slope of the spectral efficiency curve at zero spectral efficiency. While the minimum bit energy is a\nperformance measure as SNR \u2192 0, wideband slope has emerged as a tool that enables us to analyze the energy\nefficiency at low but nonzero power levels and at large but finite bandwidths. In [2], the tradeoff between\nspectral efficiency and energy efficiency is analyzed considering the Shannon capacity. In this paper, we\nperform a similar analysis employing the effective capacity. Here, we denote the effective capacity normalized\nby bandwidth or equivalently the spectral efficiency in bits per second per Hertz by\nCE (SNR, \u03b8) =\n\n1\nCE (SNR, \u03b8)\n=\u2212\nloge E{e\u2212\u03b8T R[i] }.\nB\n\u03b8T B\n\n(12)\n\nHence, we characterize the spectral efficiency\u2013bit energy tradeoff under QoS constraints. Note that effective\ncapacity provides a characterization of the arrival process. However, since the average arrival rate is equal\nto the average departure rate when the queue is in steady-state [12], effective capacity can also be seen as\na measure of the average rate of transmission. We first have the following preliminary result.\nLemma 1: The normalized effective capacity, CE (SNR), given in (12) is a concave function of\nProof : It can be easily seen that e\u2212\u03b8T R[i] , where R[i] = B log2 (1 +\n\nSNRz[i])\n\nSNR.\n\nor R[i] = B log2 (1 +\n\n\u03bcopt (\u03b8, z[i])z[i]), is a log-convex function of SNR because \u2212R[i] is a convex function of SNR. Since logR\nconvexity is preserved under sums, g(x) = f (x, y)dy is log-convex in x if f (x, y) is log-convex in x for\neach y [30]. From this fact, we immediately conclude that E{e\u2212\u03b8T R[i] } is also a log-convex function of\n\nHence, loge E{e\u2212\u03b8T R[i] } is convex and \u2212 loge E{e\u2212\u03b8T R[i] } is concave in\nThen, it can be easily seen that\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nSNR.\n\nSNR.\n\n\u0003\n\nunder QoS constraints can be obtained from [2]\n\nSNR\n1\nEb\n= lim\n.\n=\nN0 min SNR\u21920 CE (SNR)\n\u010aE (0)\n\n7\n\n(13)\n\n\fAt\n\nEb\n,\nN0 min\n\nthe slope S0 of the spectral efficiency versus Eb /N0 (in dB) curve is defined as [2]\nS0 =\n\nEb\nCE ( N\n)\n0\n\nlim\n\nEb Eb\n\u2193\nN0 N0 min\n\n10 log10\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u2212 10 log10\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\n10 log10 2.\n\n(14)\n\nConsidering the expression for normalized effective capacity, the wideband slope can be found from\nS0 = \u2212\n\n2(\u010aE (0))2\nloge 2\nC\u0308E (0)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u010aE (0) and C\u0308E (0) are the first and second derivatives, respectively, of the function CE (SNR) in bits/s/Hz\nat zero\n\nSNR\n\n[2].\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nand S0 provide a linear approximation of the spectral efficiency curve at low spectral\n\nefficiencies, i.e.,\nCE\nwhere\n\nEb\nN0\n\ndB\n\n= 10 log10\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u0012\n\nEb\nN0\n\n\u0013\n\nand \u01eb = o\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0012\n\nS0\n=\n10 log10 2\nEb\nN0\n\n\u2212\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nEb\nN0\n\nEb\n\u2212\nN0 min\ndB\n\ndB\n\n\u0013\n\n+\u01eb\n\n(16)\n\n\u0011\n.\n\nIV.

From the Shannon\ncapacity perspective, similar performances are achieved in these two regimes, which therefore can be seen\nas equivalent. However, as we shall see in this paper, considering the effective capacity leads to different\nresults at low power and high bandwidth levels. In this section, we consider the low-power regime for fixed\nbandwidth, B, and study the spectral efficiency vs. bit energy tradeoff by finding the minimum bit energy\nand the wideband slope.\n\nA.

Hence, the energy efficiency\nagain approaches the performance of an unconstrained system as power diminishes. Searching for an intuitive\nexplanation of this observation, we note that arrival rates that can be supported vanishes with decreasing\npower levels. As a result, the impact of buffer occupancy constraints on the performance lessens. Note that in\ncontrast, increasing the bandwidth increases the arrival rates supported by the system. Therefore, limitations\non the buffer occupancy will have significant impact upon the energy efficiency in the wideband regime as\nwill be discussed in Section V.\n\n11\n\n\fFig. 3 plots the spectral efficiency vs. bit energy for different values of \u03b8 in the Rayleigh fading channel\nwith E{z} = 1.

Fig. 4 plots the spectral efficiency curves as a function of bit energy in the Rayleigh channel.\nIn all the curves, we set P\u0304 /N0 = 104 . We immediately observe that more stringent QoS constraints\nand hence higher values of \u03b8 lead to higher minimum bit energy values and also higher energy requirements at other nonzero spectral efficiencies. The wideband slope values are found to be equal to S0 =\n{1.0288, 1.2817, 3.3401, 12.3484} for \u03b8 = {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1}, respectively.\nWe finally note that\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nand S0 now depend on \u03b8 and\n\nP\u0304\n.\nN0\n\nFig. 5 plots\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nas a function of these two\n\nparameters. Probing into the inherent relationships among these parameters can give us some interesting\nresults, which are helpful in designing wireless networks. For instance, for some P\u0304 /N0 required to achieve\nsome specific transmission rate, we can find the most stringent QoS guarantee possible while attaining a\ncertain efficiency in the usage of energy, or if a QoS requirement \u03b8 is specified, we can find the minimum\npower P\u0304 to achieve a specific bit energy.\nB.

From (43), this is clearly not possible for \u03b8 > 0.\n\nHence, we have proved that \u03b1\u2217 < \u221e when \u03b8 > 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark: As noted before, wideband and low-power regimes are equivalent when \u03b8 = 0. Hence, as in\nthe proof of Theorem 2, we can easily see in the wideband regime that the threshold \u03b1 approaches the\nmaximum fading value zmax as \u03b6 \u2192 0 when \u03b8 = 0. Hence, for fading distributions with unbounded support,\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e with vanishing \u03b6. The threshold being very large means that the transmitter waits sufficiently long\nuntil the fading assumes very large values and becomes favorable. That is how arbitrarily small bit energy\nvalues can be attained. However, in the presence of QoS constraints, arbitrarily long waiting times will not\nbe permitted. As a result, \u03b1 approaches a finite value (i.e., \u03b1\u2217 < \u221e) as \u03b6 \u2192 0 when \u03b8 > 0. Moreover, from\n(43), we can immediately note that as \u03b8 increases, \u03b1\u2217 has to decrease. This fact can also be observed in\nFig. 6 in which \u03b1 vs. \u03b6 is plotted in the Rayleigh fading channel. Consequently, arbitrarily small bit energy\nvalues will no longer be possible when \u03b8 > 0 as will be shown in Theorem 5.\nThe spectral efficiency with optimal power adaptation is now given by\nCE (\u03b6) = \u2212\n\n\u0010\nn\u0010 z \u0011\u2212 \u03b8T +\u03b6\u03b8Tlog 2\no\u0011\n\u03b6\ne\n\u03c4 (\u03b1)\nloge F (\u03b1) + E\n\u03b8T\n\u03b1\n\n(54)\n\nwhere again F (\u03b1) = E{1{z < \u03b1}} and \u03c4 (\u03b1) = 1{\u03c4 \u2265 \u03b1}.\nTheorem 5: When both the receiver and transmitter have CSI, the minimum bit energy and wideband\nslope in the wideband regime are given by\n\u03b8T P\u0304\nEb\n\u03be(loge \u03be)2 loge 2\n=\u2212\nand S0 =\n\u2217\nN0 min\nN0 loge \u03be\n\u03b8T ( P\u0304N\u03b10 + \u03b1\u0307(0)E{ 1z \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )})\n16\n\n(55)\n\n\fwhere \u03be = F (\u03b1\u2217 ) + E{ \u03b1z \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )}, and \u03b1\u0307(0) is the derivative of \u03b1 with respect to \u03b6, evaluated at \u03b6 = 0.\n\u2217\n\nProof : Substituting (54) into (33) leads to\nEb\n= lim\nN0 min \u03b6\u21920\n\n\u03b6\n\u2212 \u03b8T\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6/N0\n\u03b8T P\u0304\n\u0010\nn\no\u0011 .\n\u0010\nn\u0010 \u0011\u2212 \u03b8T +\u03b6\u03b8Tlog 2\no\u0011 = \u2212\n\u03b1\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\ne\nz\nN0 loge F (\u03b1 ) + E z \u03c4 (\u03b1 )\nloge F (\u03b1) + E \u03b1\n\u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\n(56)\n\nAfter denoting \u03be = F (\u03b1\u2217 ) + E{ \u03b1z \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )}, we obtain the expression for minimum bit energy in (55).\n\u2217\n\nMeanwhile, CE (\u03b6) has the following Taylor series expansion up to second order:\n1\nCE (\u03b6) = \u010aE (0)\u03b6 + C\u0308E (0)\u03b6 2 + o(\u03b6 2).\n2\n\n(57)\n\nTherefore, the second derivative of CE with respect to \u03b6 at \u03b6 = 0 can be computed from\nCE (\u03b6) \u2212 C \u0307E (0)\u03b6\n.\n\u03b6\u21920\n\u03b62\n\nC\u0308E (0) = 2 lim\n\n(58)\n\nFrom the derivation of (56) and (33), we know that\n\u010aE (0) = \u2212\nThen,\nC\u0308E (0) = 2 lim\n\n\u03b6\n\u2212 \u03b8T\n\n\u03b6\u21920\n\n\u0010\nn\u0010 \u0011\u2212 \u03b8T +\u03b6\u03b8Tlog 2\no\u0011\ne\nloge F (\u03b1) + E \u03b1z\n\u03c4 (\u03b1) +\n\nloge\n\nn\n\n=\u2212\n\n2 loge 2\n(\u03b8T )2\n\n\u03b1\nz\n\n\u0001 \u03b8T +\u03b6\u03b8Tlog\nn\n\nF (\u03b1\u2217 )+E\n\n2\nlim\n\u03b8T \u03b6\u21920\n\n2\nlim\n=\u2212\n\u03b8T \u03b6\u21920\n\n\u03b6\n\u03b8T\n\n\u03b62\n\nF (\u03b1)+E\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u0010\nn \u03b1\u2217\no\u0011\n1\nloge F (\u03b1\u2217) + E\n\u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 ) .\n\u03b8T\nz\n\n\u03b6\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\nn \u2217\no\u0011\nloge F (\u03b1\u2217 ) + E \u03b1z \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )\n\n(60)\n\no\n\ne 2 \u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\no\n\n\u03b1\u2217\n\u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )\nz\n\n\u001a\n\u03b8T\nE ( \u03b1z ) \u03b8T +\u03b6 loge 2 \u2212\n\n\u001a\n\u2217\nE \u03b1z\n\n(59)\n\n(61)\n\n\u03b8T loge 2\n(\u03b8T +\u03b6 loge 2)2\n\n\u03b1\nz\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03b8T \u03b1\u0307\n(\u03b8T +\u03b6 loge 2)\u03b1\n\nloge\n+\no\nn\n\u03b1\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nF (\u03b1 ) + E z \u03c4 (\u03b1 )\n\u001b\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03b1\u0307(0)\nz\n\u2217\nloge \u03b1\u2217 \u03c4 (\u03b1 ) + \u03b8T\nE{ z1 \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )}\nloge 2\no\nn\n,\n\u2217\nF (\u03b1\u2217) + E \u03b1z \u03c4 (\u03b1\u2217 )\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\n\u001b\n\n(62)\n\n(63)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u0307 is the derivative of \u03b1 with respect to \u03b6.

Hence, we see\na stark difference between the wideband regime and low-power regime in which the minimum bit energy\nis zero for fading distributions with unbounded support. Fig. 7 plots the spectral efficiency curves in the\nRayleigh fading channel and is in perfect agreement with the theoretical results. Obviously, the plots are\ndrastically different from those in the low-power regime (Fig. 3) where all curves approach \u2212\u221e as the\nspectral efficiency decreases. In Fig. 7, the minimum bit energy is finite for the cases in which \u03b8 > 0. The\nwideband slope values are computed to be equal to S0 = {0.3081, 1.0455, 2.5758, 4.1869}. Fig. 8 plots the\nEb\nN0 min\n\nas a function of \u03b8 and P\u0304 /N0 . Generally speaking, due to power and rate adaptation,\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\nin this\n\ncase is smaller compared to that in the case in which only the receiver has CSI. This can be observed in\nFig. 9 where the minimum bit energies are compared. From Fig. 9, we note that the presence of CSI at\nthe transmitter is especially beneficial for very small and also large values of \u03b8. While the bit energy in\nthe CSIR case approaches \u22121.59 dB with vanishing \u03b8, it decreases to \u2212\u221e dB when also the transmitter\nknows the channel. On the other hand, when \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22123 , we interestingly observe that there is not much to\nbe gained in terms of the minimum bit energy by having CSI at the transmitter. For \u03b8 > 10\u22123 , we again\nstart having improvements with the presence of CSIT.\nThroughout the paper, numerical results are provided for the Rayleigh fading channel. However, note\nthat the theoretical results hold for general stationary and ergodic fading processes. Hence, other fading\ndistributions can easily be accommodated as well. In Fig. 10, we plot the spectral efficiency vs. bit energy\ncurves for the Nakagami-m fading channel with m = 2.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have analyzed the energy efficiency in fading channel under QoS constraints by\nconsidering the effective capacity as a measure of the maximum throughput under certain statistical QoS\nconstraints, and analyzing the bit energy levels. Our analysis has provided a characterization of the energybandwidth-delay tradeoff. In particular, we have investigated the spectral efficiency vs. bit energy tradeoff\nin the low-power and wideband regimes under QoS constraints. We have elaborated the analysis under two\nscenarios: perfect CSI available at the receiver and perfect CSI available at both the receiver and transmitter.\nWe have obtained expressions for the minimum bit energy and wideband slope. Through this analysis, we\nhave quantified the increased energy requirements in the presence of delay-QoS constraints. While the bit\n18\n\n\fenergy levels in the low-power regime can approach those that can be attained in the absence of QoS\nconstraints, we have shown that strictly higher bit energy values are needed in the wideband regime. For\ninstance, we have shown that when both the transmitter and receiver has perfect CSI,\nEb\nN0 min\n\nwideband regime for \u03b8 > 0 while\n\nEb\nN0 min\n\n> 0 in the\n\n= 0 if \u03b8 = 0 for fading distributions with unbounded support.\n\nWe have also provided numerical results by considering the Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels and\nverified the theoretical conclusions.\nA PPENDIX I\nConsidering (31), we denote\nCE (\u03b6) =\n\n1\nCE (\u03b6)\n\u2212 \u03b8T\n=\u2212\nloge E{e \u03b6\n\u03b6\n\u03b8T\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\nlog2 (1+ N\nz)\n0\n\n}.\n\n(64)\n\nThe first derivative of CE (\u03b6) with respect to \u03b6 is given by\n\n\u010aE (\u03b6) = \u2212\nWe let \u03bd =\n\u03bd\n(1+\u03bd)2\n\n\u1e8f =\nCE (\u03b6)\n\u03b6\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\nz\nN0\n\n1\n\u03b6 2 log\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\nloge 2(1+ N\nz) \u0002\n\u2212 \u03b8T\n\u03b6\n\nE{e\ne\n\n2\n\n0\n\nloge (1 +\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\nz)\nN0\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\n\u2212 \u03b8T\nlog2 (1+ N\nz)\n\u03b6\n\nE{e\n\n\u2265 0, and define y(\u03bd) = loge (1 + \u03bd) \u2212\n\n0\n\n\u03bd\n,\n1+\u03bd\n\n\u2212\n\nP\u0304 \u03b6\nz\nN0\nP\u0304 \u03b6\n1+ N z\n0\n\n\u0003\n}\n\n.\n\n(65)\n\n}\n\nwhere y(0) = 0.
