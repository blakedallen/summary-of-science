The brilliant Balmer H\u03b1 line in the stationary emission spectrum of the Galactic microquasar SS 433 has a broad component\n(\u223c 1000 km s\u22121 ). This is formed in the wind blowing from the accretion disk of the compact object, which orbits the centre of mass of\nthe binary at \u223c 175 km s\u22121 with a 13-day period. The centroid of the H\u03b1 emission line formed in the wind has an imperfect memory\nof the motion of its source.\nAims. The aim is to understand how this emission line is left with a blurred memory of the motion of the source of the wind.\nMethods. We analysed stationary H\u03b1 spectra, taken almost nightly over two orbital periods of the binary system.\nResults. The loss of memory by emission lines from the wind is easily understood quantitatively, if any parcel of wind that has been\nnewly conditioned to radiate in H\u03b1 continues its emission for a period of days. If the decay is exponential, a mean lifetime of about\ntwo days is all that is required. This timescale is very close to what is required for the decay of H\u03b1 from the putative circumbinary\ndisk to be responsible for the narrow components of the H\u03b1 emission line. It is also close to the timescales observed for the individual\nbolides that radiate H\u03b1 in the relativistic jets.\nConclusions. The structure of the stationary H\u03b1 emission line is now well understood. The broad component is undoubtedly formed\nin the wind from the accretion disk and the two narrow components carry no such signature. Their properties are entirely consistent\nwith an origin in a circumbinary disk. The characteristic lifetime of H\u03b1 emitting material is a few days, as observed for the relativistic\nbolides in the jets.\nKey words. stars: individual: SS 433 - binaries: close - stars: fundamental parameters - winds\n\n1. Introduction\nWe consider a very luminous star blowing a dense wind and a\nparticular shell within that wind. It is accelerated rapidly to the\nterminal velocity, perhaps several thousand km s\u22121 . When close\nto the terminal velocity that expanding shell is effectively detached from the star and thereafter continues to expand with its\ncentre following a straight-line trajectory, the velocity vector of\nwhich is equal to the velocity vector of the source at the time of\ndetachment. If the very luminous source is a member of a binary\nsystem, the trajectory of the centre of a shell of wind does not\ndeviate as the star continues in its closed orbit. Thus if emission\nlines are formed in the shell after the time of detachment, the\nmean Doppler shift of the shell spectrum will reflect the velocity\nvector of the source at the time of detachment rather than at the\ntime of formation of the emission lines. If any given shell glows\nfor a time lasting a significant fraction of the binary orbit, at any\none moment the centre of any emission line will reflect the velocity of the source, but delayed and averaged over part of the\norbit. The centre of an emission line formed in the wind will (for\nan approximately circular orbit seen approximately edge on) execute a sinusoidal oscillation with a velocity amplitude smaller\nthan that of a line formed in the atmosphere co-moving with\nthe star. This scenario is speculative, but might be relevant to binary systems containing Wolf-Rayet stars or objects with at least\nsome of their observational characteristics. One such object is\nthe Galactic microquasar SS 433, and in this note I suggest that\nSend offprint requests to: M. G. Bowler\ne-mail: m.bowler1@physics.ox.ac.uk\n\nthe emission spectrum associated with the wind from the accretion disk exhibits just this behaviour.\nSS 433 is very luminous and famous for its continual ejection of plasma in two opposite jets at approximately one quarter the speed of light. The system is a 13-day binary ( probably powered by supercritcal accretion by the compact member\nfrom its companion), and the orbital speed of the compact object is fairly well established as \u223c 175 km s\u22121 . Despite the fame\nof the emission lines from the relativistic jets, the so-called stationary emission lines are much more intense, in particular the\nbrilliant H\u03b1 line. Most aspects of the system are reviewed in\nFabrika (2004). The stationary lines in fact are not quite stationary, rather they exhibit sinusoidal Doppler shifts with a 13-day\nperiod; the oscillation of H\u03b2 and He I stationary emission lines\nfirst demonstrated that SS 433 is a binary (Crampton, Cowley &\nHutchings 1980). The velocity amplitudes of the Balmer series\nand He I lines, when treated as though they come from a single\nsource, are very roughly 70 km s\u22121 and do not provide a direct\nmeasure of the orbital speeds of either the compact object or its\ncompanion, because they are redshifted most when the compact\nobject is very close to eclipse by the companion (orbital phase\n0), rather than a quarter of a period earlier when the compact\nobject is receding fastest from us (orbital phase 0.75); see for\nexample Crampton & Hutchings (1981) and Gies et al (2002).\nThis phasing of the emission lines relative to the photometric\nephemeris naturally suggests that the Balmer and He I emission\nlines are formed in an accretion stream passing from the donor\nto the companion. However, Gies et al (2002), evidently influenced by the extreme brilliance of the stationary H\u03b1, proposes\nthat these emission lines are formed in the wind from the ac-\n\n\f2\n\nBowler: The wind of SS 433 (RN)\n\ncretion disk, but at distances comparable to or greater than the\ndimensions of the binary system. In that paper it is suggested\nthat interference with the wind from the disk by the companion,\nor indeed by a wind from the companion, creates a void in the\ndisk wind. This void would enfeeble the blue part of the spectrum when the companion is between us and the compact object\n(and conversely enfeeble the red half a period later). The origins\nof the stationary emission lines were later clarified by analysis\nof the stationary H\u03b1 line, in terms of a superposition of several\nGaussian profiles (Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick 2008),\nexploiting a remarkable sequence of spectra taken nightly over\nseveral orbits (see Schmidtobreick & Blundell 2006).\n\n275\n\n270\n\nJD - 2453000\n\n265\n\n260\n\n255\n\n250\n\n245\n6540\n\n6560\n\n6580\n\n6600\n\nWavelength Angstroms\n\nFig. 1.

H\u03b1, He I, and three-component analysis\nThe spectra used in Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick (2008)\nare displayed as a montage in Fig.2 of Schmidtobreick &\nBlundell (2006). That data set extends from JD 2453245 until\nJD 2453321, and in Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick (2008)\nthe spectra were analysed up to JD +274, after which there was\nsomething of a hiatus, followed by an optical outburst and a radio flare (Blundell, Schmidtobreick & Trushkin 2011). Up to\nJD +274, most H\u03b1 spectra were adequately fitted with three\nGaussians, each characterised by centroid and a width parameter\n\ntaken as the standard deviation of the Gaussian, \u03c3. Two were narrow, having \u03c3 of only a few \u00c5. The third component was much\nbroader, with \u03c3 up to 20 \u00c5. This third component was identified with an origin in the wind above the accretion disk, and\nit is the subject of the present paper. Fig.1 of Blundell, Bowler\n& Schmidtobreick (2008) displays the centroids of these fitted\nGaussians as a function of time, in the same sequence as the\nmontage in Fig.2 of Schmidtobreick & Blundell (2006). Because\nof their importance, I have reproduced these data in Fig.1. This\nfigure shows that the two narrow Gaussian components of H\u03b1\nhave centroids that scarcely move over more than two orbits, and\nthe broad component oscillates in Doppler shift with a period of\n13 days. It is most redshifted close to orbital phase 0, at primary\neclipse. This might suggest that this component is formed in an\naccretion stream rather than in the wind. The two narrow components were identified with the inner rim of a circumbinary disk\nin Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick (2008).\nA very similar plot has been obtained from a set of H\u03b1\nspectra taken between 2004 and 2008 at the Purple Mountain\nObservatory. The original data are to be found in Fig.2 of Li &\nYan (2010) and the motions of fitted centroids as a function of\norbital phase are displayed in Fig.2 of Bowler (2011a). The same\nfeatures are apparent.\nIn Fig.2 I show the variation of Doppler speed for the\ncentre of the H\u03b1 broad component (Blundell, Bowler &\nSchmidtobreick 2008) and above it the same for the broader\ncomponent of the He I 6678 \u00c5 line, obtained from my fits reported in Bowler (2011b). These broad components have centroids that oscillate with a 13-day period and with velocity amplitude \u223c110 km s\u22121 . They are most redshifted a little before\norbital phase 0 and most blueshifted a little before 0.5. Lines\nproduced in an atmosphere co-moving with the compact object would be most redshifted at orbital phase 0.75 and most\nblueshifted at 0.25 - the broad lines associated with the wind\nlag the motion of the compact object by \u223c 0.2 of a period and\nhave a reduced orbital Doppler amplitude.\nThe identification of the broad component of the H\u03b1 emission line with an origin in the wind from the disk is discussed in\nBlundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick (2008). In brief, the width\nparameter \u03c3 drops smoothly from approximately 20 \u00c5 near JD\n+245 (precession phase approximately 0; accretion disk wide\nopen) to 10 \u00c5 near JD +274 as the accretion disk comes closer\nto edge on. In addition, this measure of the line of sight wind\nspeed follows the nodding motion of the accretion disk, as inferred from the Doppler shifts of the relativistic jets (Blundell,\nBowler & Schmidtobreick 2007). The synthesis of absorption\nline studies of the wind (Fabrika 1997, 2004) shows that the line\nof sight expansion speed varies as approximately the square of\nthe cosine of the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight,\nreaching 1600 km s\u22121 for 60\u25e6 . Thus these observations have established that the source of this wind line is rooted in the accretion disk. In Blundell, Bowler and Schmidtobreick (2008) the\nauthors cautiously observed that despite this, the motion of the\ncentroid of the wind should not be taken as a measure of the orbital velocity of the compact object. If a given parcel of wind\ncontinues emitting H\u03b1 over a period of several days, the data\ndisplayed in Fig.2 are reconciled with an origin in the tilting and\nnodding accretion disk, according to the scenario sketched in the\nintroduction.\n\n3. Quantitative considerations\nAbsorption line studies have shown that the wind from SS 433\nis slow in the plane of the accretion disk, but that the speed in-\n\n\fBowler: The wind of SS 433 (RN)\n300\n\nDoppler speed\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n245\n\n250\n\n255\n\n260\n\n265\n\n270\n\n275\n\n250\n\nDoppler speed\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03c9 is given by 2\u03c0/P. Thus when t is one quarter of the period P after primary eclipse, the compact object is approaching\nwith speed v x and is receding with speed v x a quarter of a period\nbefore primary eclipse.\nI now assume that a shell of wind lights up suddenly (say\nin H\u03b1) at time t but became detached a time s earlier, the centroid moving with speed v x tangential to the orbit. For a delay s\nof 0.25P, the most redshifted centroid is observed when t = P\nrather than 0.75P. The phasing of the wind centroid relative to\nthe photometric ephemeris only requires a delay of \u223c2 days. The\nfinal step is to suppose that the H\u03b1 emission dies away over a\ntimescale of several days. This will affect the phase and also\nmakes an average of the line-of-sight velocity of the H\u03b1 centroid, thereby reducing the amplitude of vr below v x . This may\nbe calculated by specifying some emission function of s with\na delay parameter \u03c4 and a duration parameter T ; f (s; \u03c4, T ). At\ntime t, the centroid of the shell detached a time s earlier has recessional velocity given by\nvr (t, s) = \u2212v x sin \u03c9(t \u2212 s).\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\n-50\n245\n\n250\n\n255\n\n260\nJD - 2453000\n\n265\n\n270\n\n275\n\nFig. 2.

The results\nare summarised in Fabrika (1997, 2004) in the form\nVw = 8000 cos2 \u03b1 + 150\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vw is the velocity (in km s\u22121 ) of the gas flowing out\nfrom the disk as a function of the polar angle \u03b1. The width \u03c3\nof the broad H\u03b1 component in the data of Blundell, Bowler &\nSchmidtobreick (2008) has a value of \u223c20 \u00c5 early on, when the\nangle \u03c7 between the jet axis and the line of sight has a value of\n\u223c 60\u25e6 , declining to 10 \u00c5 by JD +274, when \u03c7 has a value of\n\u223c 70\u25e6 . These widths correspond to speeds of 900 and 450 km\ns\u22121 , respectively, and the data are represented fairly well by the\nrelation\nsw = 3000 cos2 \u03c7\n\n(2)\n\nwhere sw is the width \u03c3 translated into speed in km s\u22121 . The\nspeeds in the wings of the wind H\u03b1 line are even greater. Thus\ntypical wind speeds are very roughly an order of magnitude\ngreater than the orbital speed of the compact object, and a parcel\nof wind covers a distance of roughly 1.5 108 km in a single day.\nThis distance is several times larger than the semi-major axis of\nthe binary system and because the fast wind is predominantly\nperpendicular to the accretion disk (see also Perez & Blundell\n2010) it tends to be out of the plane of the orbit.\nIt remains to make a quantitative estimate of the effect of\nany given region of the wind emitting over a period of perhaps\nseveral days. I approximate the line of sight to the orbital plane\n(it actually makes an angle of \u223c12\u25e6 ) and suppose a circular orbit,\nso that the recessional velocity of a source co-moving with the\ncompact object would be given by\nvr = \u2212v x sin \u03c9t\n\n(3)\n\nThe value perceived at time t is obtained by averaging over\nall s, using f (s; \u03c4, T ) as the weight. The important point is that\nfor durations of a few days the average over s, < vr (t) >, represents very well the data in both amplitude and phase. For the\npurpose of illustration I have used two different functions for the\nemission factor f (s). In the first case I supposed a rectangular\nprofile as a function of s, with a duration of T . This switches on\nat s = \u03c4 \u2212 T/2 and switches off at s = \u03c4 + T/2, it being supposed\nthat \u03c4 exceeds T/2. The weighted average is then\n< vr (t) >= \u2212v x sin \u03c9(t \u2212 \u03c4) sin(\u03c9T/2)/(\u03c9T/2).\n\n(5)\n\nThis is not a realistic form, but it makes the point and the\nstructure is easy to visualise. For the particular case of the parameter \u03c4 = T/2 (ignition immediately on launch) and duration\ntime T = P/2, the centroid of the wind is most redshifted at orbital phase 0, one quarter of a period late, and the amplitude is\nv x sinc(\u03c0/2), which for v x 175 km s\u22121 is 111 km s\u22121 . These results are very close to the behaviour of the data. The parameters\nT and \u03c4 might exhibit some fluctuation with time - winds can be\ngusty.\nA probably more realistic form is to suppose exponential decay of the emission factor after the initial light up. In this case the\nduration parameter T is the decay time of the exponential, and\nthere is a delay \u03c4 between launch and ignition. The weighted\naverage recession is now\n< vr (t) >=\n\nvx\n[\u2212 sin \u03c9(t \u2212 \u03c4) + \u03c9T cos \u03c9(t \u2212 \u03c4)].\n1 + (\u03c9T )2\n\n(6)\n\nFor the simple case of \u03c9T = 1, the decay \u221atime T is about\ntwo days, the amplitude of the oscillation is v x / 2 (124 km s\u22121 )\nand the recession velocity is greatest at orbital phase 0.875 for\nthe case of instant ignition, \u03c4 = 0. Thus these simple models\nhave demonstrated that both the amplitude and the phase of the\ncentroid of the broad component of H\u03b1, relative to the photometric ephemeris, are easily understood in terms of a wind that\nbecomes detached from the orbiting source and decays away in\nH\u03b1 over a few days. The amplitude and phase of the wind centroid is reconciled with the way in which the line-of-sight wind\nspeed varies with the nodding of the disk (Blundell, Bowler &\nSchmidtobreick 2008).\n\n\f4\n\nBowler: The wind of SS 433 (RN)\n200\n\nThe period from JD +245 to + 274 was a period of calm before the storm. The persistent pattern in H\u03b1 of two narrow components with a broad wind swinging between them was overwhelmed by an optical outburst commencing around JD +290,\nfollowed by a radio flare. Between JD +291 and +295 the speed\nof the wind, as measured by the width \u03c3 of the broad component, rose from \u223c600 km s\u22121 to \u223c1200 km s\u22121 and then remained\nat the higher figure. The history is presented in some detail in\nBlundell, Schmidtobreick & Trushkin (2011) - see Fig.8 therein.\nIn the lower panel of Fig.3, I show the motion of the centroid of\nthe wind in H\u03b1 over the period JD +294 to +310, as displayed in\nFig.4 (c) of Blundell, Schmidtobreick & Trushkin (2011). The\namplitude is certainly consistent with the orbital speed of the\ncompact object, and despite the paucity of data, the first minimum (blueshift) occurs at approximately JD +298, an orbital\nphase only marginally above 0.25. Similarly, the following maximum redshift occurs at \u223c JD +304, marginally above orbital\nphase 0.75. These data seem to have a better memory of the motion of the source of the wind than the slower winds in quieter\ntimes; in terms of the exponential decay model the data suggest\na decay time of perhaps one day or less.\nOver this same period many of the He I spectra are rendered\nunusable by the proximity of the moving H\u03b1 lines of the jets, but\nafter JD +294 the O I triplet commencing at 7772 \u00c5 exhibits a\npronounced P Cygni absorption trough. These O I spectra may\nalso be found in Fig.2 of Schmidtobreick & Blundell (2006),\nand from that figure I have extracted the motion of the deepest\npoint of the trough. This is shown in the upper panel of Fig.3.\nThe pattern is erratic but does show some memory of the orbital\nmotion of the compact object, with an amplitude of \u223c 100 km\ns\u22121 , with minimum at orbital phase \u223c 0.5 and maximum at JD\n+306, orbital phase close to 1. These data suggest that the O I\n7772 \u00c5 line is formed in the slow equatorial wind from the disk,\nwith a speed \u223c150 km s\u22121 and that (absorption) decay times \u223c2\ndays are appropriate. [ The O I 7772 \u00c5 line is not accessible\nduring the period JD +245 to +274 because of the redshifted\nmoving H\u03b1 line.]\nThe notion of a detached wind affecting the magnitude and\nphase of Doppler shifts may also be relevant to certain absorption spectra in the blue. These have features similar to mid-A\nsupergiants and are probably formed in the wind (Barnes et al\n2006).\n\n100\n\n5. Discussion\nThe broad component of the stationary H\u03b1 line was identified\nas formed in a wind from the accretion disk of SS 433 on the\nbasis of the line of sight speed varying with the nodding of the\ndisk (Blundell, Bowler & Schmidtobreick 2008). The amplitude\nand phase of the motion of the centroid of this component have\nnow been shown to be entirely consistent with this origin, provided the emission decay time within the wind is a few days.\nThe broad component of the H\u03b1 is indeed formed in the wind on\na scale comparable to or greater than that of the binary system\n(Gies et al 2002). In contrast, the two narrow components show\nno sign of an origin within the wind; indeed, the narrow components of both H\u03b1 and He I are not consistent with such an origin\nbut are well described in terms of emission from a fairly close\ncircumbinary disk, stimulated by the intense radiation from the\nvicinity of the compact object (Bowler 2010, 2011b). It is interesting that in that circumbinary disk model the decay time for\nH\u03b1 emission must again be of the order of a few days. Thus\n\nTrough recession km/s\n\n4.

There remains the question of by what mechanisms H\u03b1 radiation is sustained for several days after ignition.\nThat at least one mechanism exists enabling clumps of plasma\nto exhibit H\u03b1 decay times of a few days is certain: the individual\nbolides ejected at about one quarter the speed of light in the jets\nfor which SS 433 is famous are visible in H\u03b1 for several days (\nsee for example Vermeulen et al 1993, Gies et al 2002, Blundell,\nBowler & Schmidtobreick 2007 ).\n\nReferences\nBarnes, A.
