Among\nsuch systems one could select carriers and impurity atoms\nin metallic or semiconductor mesoscopic structures,1 as\nalso atoms, ions and molecules trapped to microscopic\ncavities,1,2,3,4,5 . In these systems, the confinement becomes important whenever a quantum sizes equal the\ncavity length. However, the energy spectrum of these\nsystems is not only determined by the spatial confinement and its geometrical shape, but also by environmental facts such as electric and magnetic applied fields that\nbreak or lower the general symmetries. Finally, manybody effects as electron-electron interaction, may be even\nbe more important than the confinement itself. In any\ncase, a correct description of physical properties of the\nproblem requires that the wavefunction must reflect both\nthe form of confinement and the appropriated boundary\nconditions.\nInteresting confined systems are the semiconductor\nquantum dots structures (QDs), also referred as manmade artificial atoms, built as low-dimensional electronic\ngases when crystalline translation invariance is broken\nin all three spatial dimensions and leading to discrete\nenergy states, as in real atoms. Various are the approaches that have been used to deal with many-particle\nQDs. Among them, one can cite charging model,6,7,8,9\ncorrelated electron model,10 Green functions,11 Lanczos\nalgorithm,12 Monte Carlo method,13 Hartree-Fock (HF)\ncalculations,14,15,16,17 and density functional theory.18\nThe charging model can reproduce well experimental\nfindings for \"metallic dots\". On the opposite side, with\nmuch lower electronic density, the semiconductor dots\nrequires a microscopic point of view to treat the electronelectron interaction.\nHere we will consider a QD defined by a \"hard wall\"\nspherical volume which is appropriated for semiconduc-\n\ntors grown inside glass matrices. Some of the commonly\nstudied topics are the formation of energy shells in their\nspectra,19 the control of their electronic correlations,20\nthe formation of Wigner molecules,21 and the influence\nof the Coulomb interaction in their spectra.22,23 In these\nspherically defined artificial atoms both spin and orbital\nangular momenta are good quantum numbers, and the\nlow occupation many-particle eigenstates can be labelled\naccording to the LS-coupling scheme,24 . For occupation\nnumber above four, the LS-coupling scheme becomes extremely cumbersome and, in this paper, we have chosen\nthe unrestricted Pople-Nesbet matrix approach25 of the\nsingle determinant self-consistent HF formalism to treat\nshell configurations of dots containing up to forty electrons, where we have calculated the total spin expected\nvalues, chemical potential and charging energy. We show\nthe changes induced by the magnetic field on such approach, using a set of Gaussian basis (section II). Then\nwe discuss our main results (section III) by focusing on\nhow magnetic field determines the Zeeman splitting and\ninduces violation of the Hund's rule.\nWithin the Unrestricted Hartree-Fock formalism\n(UHF), the \u03b1 (spin-up) and \u03b2 (spin-down) functions\nhave different spatial\ncomponents, \u03c7i (x) =\nn\no\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03c8 j (r)\u03b1(\u03c9), \u03c8 j (r)\u03b2(\u03c9) , described by the orbitals\n\b \u03b1\n\u03c8 j |j = 1...k ({\u03c8 \u03b2j |j = 1...k}). Therefore, an UHF\nE\n\u03b2\nwavefunction has the form \u03a8UHF = \u03c8 \u03b1\n1 \u03c8 1 ... , which\nrepresents open shells once no spatial orbital can be doubly occupied. The closed shells can be also obtained,25\nmore specifically, UHF functions are not necessarily system eigenstates having well defined L and S values. Yet,\nthe number of carrier, N , must equal the the sum of spinup and spin-down electrons, as N = N \u03b1 + N \u03b2 . The integration of the spin degrees of freedom25 yields two coupled HF equations that must be simultaneously solved.\n\n\f2\nE\nE\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n, where\n\u03c8j\n= \u03b5j\nThey have the form f \u03b1/\u03b2 \u03c8 j\nthe respective Fock operators are given by\nf\n\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\n= hj +\n\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nN\nX\n\na\n\n\u03b2/\u03b1\nh\ni NX\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nJa \u2212 K a\n+\nJa\u03b2/\u03b1 .\n\n(1)\n\na\n\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\nBoth f \u03b1 and f \u03b2 include the kinetic(hj ), the direct( Ja )\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nand the exchange (Ka ) terms between electrons with\n\u03b2/\u03b1\nsame spin, and a direct term (Ja\n) between electrons\nwith opposite spins. The interdependence among f \u03b1 (f \u03b2 )\nand \u03c8 \u03b2j (\u03c8 \u03b1\ntwo\nj ) requires the simultaneous solutionnof the\no\n\b \u03b1\n\u03b2\nHF equations.

When Eq. 3 is inserted into Eq.\n1 one obtains the k \u00d7 k coupled matrix equations,\nF\u03b1/\u03b2 C\u03b1/\u03b2 = SC\u03b1/\u03b2 \u03b5\u03b1/\u03b2 ,\n\nPN \u03b1/\u03b2 \u03b1/\u03b2 \u03b1/\u03b2\u2217\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nC\u03bca C\u03bda . Thus, one can deare P\u03bc\u03bd =\na\nfine two new quantities: i) The total charge density,\n\u03c1T (r) = \u03c1\u03b1 (r) + \u03c1\u03b2 (r), that determines N when integrated over all space; ii) The spin density, \u03c1S (r) =\n\u03c1\u03b1 (r) \u2212 \u03c1\u03b2 (r), that yields 2MS after integration over all\nspace. The unrestricted wavefunctions are eigenfunctions\nof SZ , but not necessarily of S 2 , therefore one can define the total charge ( PT = P\u03b1 + P\u03b2 ) and the spin (\nPS = P\u03b1 \u2212 P\u03b2 ) density matrices for the system.

Let us consider a GaAs dot, a wide-gap\nsemiconductor having m\ne = 0.065, g = 0.45 and \u03b5 =\n12.65.\nThe inclusion of a magnetic field requires modifications\non the UHF equations. The spin-independent linear and\nquadratic magnetic terms are easyly added to the definitions of both h in f \u03b1/\u03b2 and T\u03bc\u03bd . However, the inclusion of\nthe spin-dependent linear term (\u223c B0 SZ ) to h in f \u03b1/\u03b2 requires decomposition of kinetic and Coulomb terms into\n\u03b1/\u03b2\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nT\u03bc\u03bd and G\u03bc\u03bd .

Instead of the exact spherical Bessel functions of Eq.11, the radial part of each orbital was decomposed in a sum involving five Gaussians confined to region\nx \u2264 1, while the angular part is maintained as defined by\nits symmetry, as\n\nFIG. 1: Unrestricted ground-state energy for a R0 = 100 \u00c5\nGaAs QD without magnetic field. In the upper left panel we\ncompare the unrestricted and the non-interacting energies,\nwhere the QD energy shell structure is visible. The bottom\nleft panel shows QD chemical potential (left scale) and charging energy (right scale). The former displays abrupt change\nalways when a new shell starts to be populated, while the\nlatter presents larger (smaller) peaks when a shell is fully\nfilled (half-filled), a direct consequence of the Hund's rule.\nThe bottom and upper right panels show, respectively, the\nN -evolution of the expected values of total spin and its zprojection.\n\nin (e\n\u03b1il \u2212 x) nulls functions at the zeros \u03b1\ne il of the respective spherical Bessel function transposed to the interval\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, and the last sum involves an expansion into 5\nGaussians. Higher order expansion did not show any improvement for N \u2264 40. The Gaussian coefficients Vk and\nexponents Dk are determined for each value of R0 , by\nmaximizing the superposition between Eqs. 11 and 12.\nOnce Vk and Dk are determined, we run our UHF code\nfor each value of R0 and N , and find the parameters\n\u03b1/\u03b2\nC\u03bdi that better describe Eq. 3 and give the minimal\nenergy in Eq. 6.\nAt last, we have calculated two quantities that will be\nused in the description of our results.

The panels\nshow the successive occupation (indicated in the upper right\ncorner of each panel) of the 1p shell, assuming that the 1s\nshell remains populated by one spin-up and one spin-down\nelectron. The possible spin configurations for given N are\nindicated by + (spin-up) and \u2212 (spin-down). For B0 = 0 the\nspin sequence is 1/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 3/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0, while at fields\nhigher than 3 T, it changes to 1/2 \u2212 0 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0. It\ninteresting to observe that a magnetic field can suppress the\nenergy triplets and quartets from the QD spectrum.\n\n(increases) the non-interacting ground-state energy when\noccupation corresponds to a shell less (more) than halffilled. At exactly half-filled cases N = 5, 13, 27 and\n37, the interacting and non-interacting energy values are\napproximately equal.\nIn the bottom left panel of Fig. 1 we show both QD\nchemical potential (left scale, Eq. 13) and charging energy (right scale, Eq. 14), where the respective values\nof E0 were obtained from the unrestricted calculation\npresented in the left upper panel. Notice that \u03bcdot linearly increases as the occupation increases inside a given\nshell. When such shell is totally filled, there is an abrupt\nchange in \u03bcdot indicating that the following shell starts\nits occupation. Also, the higher the occupation, the more\nabrupt is this change. An anomalous behavior seems to\noccur with the 2s shell, whose \u03bcdot -value is larger than\nthe 1f shell, that has higher energy. The charging energy\nis another form to verify not only the presence of shell\nstrusture in the spectrum, but also the validity of Hund's\nrule for the filling of such shells. In principle, Echar must\npresent larger (smaller) peaks when the total (half) occupation of a shell is achieved. The first fact is due to the\nhigher difficulty in adding an electron to a QD in a filled\nshell state, while the second one refers to Hund's rule,\nwhich states that electrons must be added to the system\nwith their spin being parallel, until all possible orbitals\ninside a given shell be occupied, making the total energy\nof the system be decreased because of the maximized exchange contribution. However, some discrepancies are\nverified in Echar : the smaller peak of N = 27 occurs here\nat N = 26, and the larger peak of N = 20 is negative.\nThe right bottom and upper panels of Fig.1 show re-\n\nspectively the N -evolution of the total spin S and its\nprojection MS as calculated from Eqs. 7 and 8 for the unrestricted energies. Notice that, with no magnetic field,\nHund's rule seems to be followed; the MS expected value\noscillates from 0 in a filled shell to its maximum in a halffilled shell, when it starts to decrease again on the way to\nthe closing of the shell; the maxima are MS = 1/2, 3/2,\n5/2 and 7/2 for s, p, d and f shells, respectively. The S\nexpected value yielded by the unrestricted formalism is\nalso very reasonable; discrepancies are only observed at\nN = 24, where S > 2, and at N = 21, where S > 1/2.\nWe believe that both discrepancies related to the 2s shell\nor to its surroundings - \u03bcdot larger than the one of 1f\nshell, negative peak for N = 20 in Echar , and almost\ndoubled S expected value for N = 21 - are caused by the\nnon-reasonable Gaussian reproduction of this orbital.27\nBy focusing on the 1p shell we show in Fig. 2, for the\nsame QD of the previous figure, how a finite magnetic\nfield is able to violate Hund's rule in the system. Panels from left to right and from up to bottom show the\nsuccessive ground state energies from N = 3 to N = 8\nas this shell is filled, always considering that the 1s shell\nremain fully occupied by two electrons, one up and one\ndown; the distinct possible spin configurations for each\nN are indicated by + (up) and \u2212 (down). In addition to\nthe small Zeeman effect present in all occupations, there\nis a changing of ground state spins at N = 4, 5 and 6\nas the field is increased. Notice that at zero field the\nspin sequence is 1/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 3/2 \u2212 1 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0; in a field\nabove 3 T it becomes 1/2 \u2212 0 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0 \u2212 1/2 \u2212 0, meaning\nthat quartets and triplets are suppressed by the magnetic\nfield, and the ground state of the system starts to oscillate only between singlets and doublets at high fields as\nN increases. When this 1p shell is half-filled (N = 5), the\nground state goes from a quartet to a doublet at B0 \u2243 2\nT; when it has one electron more (N = 6) or less (N = 4)\nthan that, it goes from a triplet to a singlet at B0 \u2243 3 T.\nAt last, in order to prove the efficiency of the PopleNesbet approach, we compared the results from this UHF\nself-consistent matrix formulation with the ones obtained\nfrom the LS-coupling scheme used in Ref. [28], where a\nGaAs QD having R0 = 90 \u00c5 was considered, and the\nquadratic term in B0 was neglected since only small fields\nwere considered; also, only N = 2 and N = 3 occupations were calculated, since the states were exactly built\n(not only a single Slater determinant), and the electronelectron interaction was included by using perturbation\ntheory, justified at such radius. At zero field the energies\nfor N = 2 are 16.5 meV (LS) and 16.1 meV (UHF), while\nfor N = 3 they are 34.8 meV (LS) and 33.9 meV (UHF);\nso, the formalism here used indeed give smaller ground\nstate energies than the LS perturbation scheme. We have\nalso checked the validity of neglecting the quadratic term\nin B0 for fields smaller than 2 T. One should emphasize\nthat a disadvantage of the UHF approach is that, in principle, it is not sure that one gets trustable information\nabout the L and S expected values of QD states; on the\nother hand, the applicability of the LS scheme is highly\n\n\f5\ndecreased as the QD occupation increases.\nWe have shown how the unrestricted Pople-Nesbet approach applied to a spherical QD under a magnetic field\nyields a reasonable description of its energetic spectrum,\nwhere a maximum occupation of 40 electrons has been\nconsidered. We have seen how both QD chemical potential and charging energy reproduce the filling and halffilling structures of its energy shells at zero field.
