Akerlof1\nakerlof@umich.edu\nand WeiKang Zheng1\nABSTRACT\nAfter almost 4 years of operation, the two instruments onboard the Fermi Gammaray Space Telescope have shown that the number of gamma-ray bursts with high energy\nphoton emission above 100 MeV cannot exceed roughly 9% of the total number of\nall such events, at least at the present detection limits. In a recent paper (Zheng et\nal. 2012c), we found that GRBs with photons detected in the Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) have a surprisingly broad distribution with respect to the observed event photon\nnumber. Extrapolation of our empirical fit to numbers of photons below our previous\ndetection limit suggests that the overall rate of such low flux events could be estimated\nby standard image co-adding techniques. In this case, we have taken advantage of the\nexcellent angular resolution of the Swif t mission to provide accurate reference points for\n79 GRB events which have eluded any previous correlations with high energy photons.\nWe find a small but significant signal in the co-added field. Guided by the extrapolated\npower law fit previously obtained for the number distribution of GRBs with higher\nfluxes, the data suggests that only a small fraction of GRBs are sources of high energy\nphotons.\nSubject headings: gamma-ray burst: general, gamma rays: stars\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA most unexpected feature of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) became apparent in 1994 with the\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) detection of an 18 GeV photon associated with GRB\n940217 (Hurley et al. 1994). About a half-dozen high energy burst events were detected throughout\nthe CGRO mission but the actual fraction of the total rate was poorly determined (Catelli et al.\n1998, Dingus 2003). Prior to the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in 2008, it was\npossible to anticipate that the LAT instrument would detect more than 200 GRB events per year\n1\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Michigan, 450 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-1040, USA\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nat energies above 100 MeV (Dingus 2003). Since the GRB spectral energy distribution at lower\nenergies has been well characterized by a modified power law with peak fluxes at energies of the\norder of 200 KeV (Kaneko et al. 2006, Goldstein et al. 2012), the existence of photons at energies\n104 times higher is a significant constraint on credible models of the GRB phenomenon (e.g. Band\net al. 2009). Thus, there had been some anticipation that the Fermi mission might considerably\nenrich our knowledge of this aspect of GRB behavior. Such hopes were dampened by the Band\npaper which was drafted 7 months after the Fermi launch. With three LAT-detected events and an\nextrapolation of BATSE spectral data, Band et al. concluded that the high energy detection rate of\nthe LAT would be about one per month. Almost four years of operation has demonstrated that the\ndetection rate of energetic GRBs is closer to 9 per year. One interesting discovery that has emerged\nis that short as well as long bursts contribute to the population of > 100 MeV emitting GRBs. To\ndate, six short events have been so identified, roughly comparable to their fraction within the total\nGRB population (GRB 080905A, 081024B, 090228A, 090510, 110529A and 111117A). This suggests\nthat the high energy photon generation process is a characteristic of relativistic jets, independent\nof the details of their specific progenitors. Given the paucity of information about energetic bursts,\nwe have embarked on a program to dig out as much information as possible from the available\ndata. This has led to a string of papers describing the discovery of seven high energy GRBs with\nsignatures too faint to be detected by more conventional statistical techniques (Akerlof et al. 2010,\nAkerlof et al. 2011, Zheng et al. 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2012d). The following work delves further\ninto this realm to understand better the extent of the association of high energy events with the\nparent class of all GRBs.\n\n2.\n\nData selection and analysis\n\nIn our first search of LAT data for faint GRBs (Akerlof et al. 2011), we recognized that\nthe precise localizations of bursts (\u03c3P SF < 5\u2032 ) detected by Swift, INTEGRAL and AGILE were\npowerful constraints for identifying associated high energy photons in the Fermi LAT. More recently,\nwe estimated the event intensity distribution and discovered that within the bounds set by limited\nstatistics, the distribution was well fit by the number of LAT photons per unit area raised to a\nconstant negative fixed power (Zheng et al. 2012c). To probe this empirical result at intensities\nbelow those required for reliable single event identification, we realized that the standard field coadding techniques of optical astronomy would work nicely with fields triggered by Swift and similar\ninstruments. The GRB events were selected in the interval from June 11, 2008, (F ermi launch\ndate) through February 29, 2012 from the Swift catalog1 for which the Fermi LAT boresight angle\nwas computed from the Fermi spacecraft attitude data2 . Since the publicly available LAT data\nstream was restricted to Pass 7 after 2011 August 6, we used Pass 6 prior to the switchover date and\n1\n\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/archive/grb table.html/\n\n2\n\nhttp://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ssc/LAT/LATDataQuery.cgi\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nPass 7 thereafter. Events were included only if they passed the maximum LAT acceptance angle\nof 74\u25e6 and no previous GRB correlations had been reported. Although the LAT acceptance drops\nsignificantly for boresight angles greater than 65\u25e6 , it is still large enough for burst detections such as\nreported by the LAT team for GRB 100414A (Takahashi et al. 2010) and GRB 120624B (Vianello\n& Kocevski 2012). Swift events were also ignored if the Fermi spacecraft was inside the South\nAtlantic Anomaly (SAA) or was otherwise inactive. A total of 79 events passed these cuts and are\nlisted in Table 1. For reference later in this paper, this sample is called \"All Swif t\". Since we were\ninterested in investigating possible correlations with the intensity of bursts at lower energies, three\nfurther selections were made, based on the Fermi GBM fluence. The fluence data was obtained\nfrom either the GBM Fermitrig catalog3 or GCN messages (Barthelmy 2000). The former took\nprecedence whenever available. There were 46 events with such GBM data and this set is named the\n\"Swif t GBM\" sample. Third and fourth samples, \"Swif t bright GBM\" and \"Swif t dim GBM\"\nconsists respectively of the 14 events with fluences greater than 10 \u03bcerg/cm2 within \"Swif t GBM\"\nand the complementary set of 32 with fluences below this bound. Since \"Swif t GBM\" is a subset\nof \"All Swif t\" and, in turn, \"Swif t bright GBM\" and \"Swif t dim GBM\" are disjoint subsets of\n\"Swif t GBM\", these four co-add sets are not statistically independent. Nevertheless, there are\ncorrelations to the low energy GRB fluxes that makes comparisons useful. It should be noted\nthat very few Pass 7 GRB events are included in any of these data sets: All Swif t - 5 out of 79,\nSwif t GBM - 2 out of 46, Swif t bright GBM - 1 out of 14 and Swif t dim GBM - 1 out of 32.\nThus, any systematic biases that might arise from somewhat different primary data processing are\nstatistically insignificant.\n\n3\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/fermi/fermigtrig.html\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nTable 1.

In the simplest case, assume\na uniform background noise, n(t), and a signal waveform, s(t). The detection significance for the\nsignal is maximized by integrating a matched filter, f (t), over the effective duration of the signal.\nVariational methods show that f (t) = c*s(t) where c is a constant. For situations with non-constant\nbackgrounds, the appropriate choice for f (t) is given by the ratio, c * s(t)/n(t). As described in\nAkerlof et al. 2011, the total weight for each photon was computed by the product of four quantities\nrepresenting the estimated signal to background ratio for energy, position on the sky, time of arrival\nand LAT photon detection class. Finally, a somewhat ad hoc weight sharing factor, \u03b6, was applied\nto kill events in which the apparent total event weight was heavily dominated by only one or two\nphotons, thus favoring the extreme tails of the background distribution.\nThe photon data selection criteria for all events is the same as described in our previous work\n(Akerlof et al. 2010, 2011 and Zheng et al. 2012b, 2012c). Briefly stated, the photon energy is\nrestricted to the range from 100 MeV to 300 GeV. A zenith angle cut of less than 105\u25e6 is applied\nas recommended by the LAT team. A detection time window is defined by the interval from T0\nto T0+47.5s where T0 is the nominal trigger time. The photons passing these three criteria are\nthen used for further analysis. The matched weight for each photon was calculated by the method\ndescribed in Akerlof et al. 2011, equations 1 - 5. Note that all classes of photons are included\ntogether in computing the matched weight score using our previously described methodology. A\nP\nweight-sharing factor, \u03b6, was computed via equation 8 and combined to yield the quantity, \u03b6 wi .\nThe final result is the sum of the matched weights for all single photons multiplied by the weightsharing factor, \u03b6. It is this value, \u03b6, that is propagated to all further analysis. Note that for each\nof the four co-add sets described above, the photons for every matching LAT data set were rotated\nto a common axis and the co-added ensemble was handled as if it were a single GRB event (see\nFigure 1 for a sky map of the Swif t GBM co-add composite field).\nThese various considerations determined how we treated two GRBs with previously reported\nLAT detections, GRB100728A and GRB110625A. GRB 100728A (Abdo et al., 2011) has been\nincluded in our analysis since although LAT emission was found to be associated with a late time\nX-ray flare, no LAT emission was reported during the GRB prompt phase from 0 to 167 s. In the\ncase of GRB 110625A (Tam et al., 2012), the event was excluded on the basis of the LAT boresight\nangle of 88\u25e6 when the GRB occurred.\nThe first question is whether there is evidence for any significant association of high energy\nphotons with these GRB fields. To test this assumption, 1256 sets of random co-added fields were\nconstructed with LAT data appropriate for each of the four samples with 79, 46, 14 and 32 GRB\nevents respectively. For each of the 1256 random co-added sets, every single constituent field was\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nTable 1-Continued\nGRB\n\nUT\n\nMET\n\n110102A\n110119A\n110128A\n110207A\n110223A\n110328A\n110411A\n110412A\n110414A\n110610A\n110903A\n111029A\n111208A\n120212A\n120215A\n\n18:52:25\n22:20:58\n01:44:33\n11:17:20\n20:56:59\n12:57:45\n19:34:11\n07:33:21\n07:42:14\n15:21:32\n02:39:55\n09:44:40\n08:28:11\n09:11:22\n00:41:15\n\n315687147\n317168460\n317871875\n318770242\n320187421\n323009867\n324243253\n324286403\n324459736\n329412094\n336710397\n341574282\n345025693\n350730684\n350959277\n\nRA\n(\u25e6 )\n\nDec\n(\u25e6 )\n\n245.877\n7.617\n348.589\n5.982\n193.871 28.108\n12.540 -10.790\n345.386 87.586\n251.233 57.590\n291.427 67.706\n133.491 13.488\n97.876 24.349\n308.205 74.827\n197.061 58.985\n44.785 57.101\n290.215 40.669\n43.086 -18.043\n30.057\n8.790\n\n\u03b8bore\n(\u25e6 )\n37.7\n71.9\n45.1\n71.6\n44.0\n46.6\n33.3\n54.3\n18.3\n66.2\n44.4\n15.5\n47.7\n48.8\n54.0\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nselected at random time but with center position identical to the corresponding GRB field. These\nrandom fields also had boresight and zenith angles similar to the corresponding GRB data. The\ndistribution of these weights is shown in Figure 2 for the \"Swif t GBM\" sample of 46. In this case,\n7 random fields out of the 1256 yielded a weight greater than for the actual set associated with\nGRBs. Similar results were obtained for the other samples as well, setting an overall confidence\nlevel in the neighborhood of 99% that a modest excess of GRB-related photons has been detected.\nA synopsis of these estimates is provided in Table 2.\nThe conclusion that a few GRB photons were associated with Swift-triggered events was probed\nin two different ways. It was noted that the fields associated with the 79 GRB events were not\nuniform in intensity as measured by the sum of matched filter weights over the 1256 observations of\neach field taken randomly in time. By comparison of one half of the random data observations with\nthe other, a substantial pair-wise correlation was observed for each individual GRB direction. The\nnoisiest 8 GRB fields were removed and the previous analysis re-run to see if background astrophysical sources were a major contamination. The significance levels for the GRB signals compared to\nthe random co-added sets remained at the \u223c99% level for all except the \"Swif t dim GBM\" sample. Secondly, it was noted that the matched filter weight method was moderately sensitive to\ninfrequent statistical fluctuations with large weight values. To avoid this possible instability, a\nranking procedure was invoked that involved two separate steps. First, the 80th percentile weight\nwas determined for every set of 1256 random fields associated with each GRB event. Next, a\nscore was computed for every random and GRB field based on simply summing the number of two\nhighest photon weights above the 80th percentile cut for each field. For the two co-add samples\nwith the greatest GBM fluences, \"Swif t GBM\" and \"Swif t bright GBM\", there appeared to be a\nsignificant correlation with the GRB co-add sets surpassing 93% and 97% of the equivalent random\ngroups. In summary, we believe that this analysis has found reasonable evidence for a few GRB\nphotons within a number of events but this number is remarkably small.\n\n2.2.\n\nEstimating the number of GRB high energy photons\n\nSince the Swift sample is apparently associated with a non-zero number of GRB photons, the\nnext step was to modify the 1256 random fields previously described by adding a fixed number of\nGRB photons taken randomly, with replacement, from the set of 851 photons described in Table 2\nof Zheng et al. 2012c. Since the only parameter of interest is the GRB photon weight, these values\nwere chosen by randomly selecting values from the appropriate 851-fold array. This procedure was\niterated 1000 times for a total of 1256000 co-added fields for each integer number, n, of injected\nGRB photons. The integral distributions of the matched filter weights for the ensemble are shown\nin Figure 2 for pure random background fields (red line) and 1 to 20 injected GRB photons (blue\nlines). To find the most probable photon number for each data set, the integral distribution for\neach curve was estimated at the actual matched filter value. The quoted photon number was\ninterpolated from the two values that bracketed 50%. A similar procedure was pursued for the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- LAT high energy photon sky map for the photons created by co-adding 46 GRB fields\ntriggered by Swift and confirmed by the Fermi GBM. Each field is centered on the GRB direction\ndetermined by Swift which is indicated by the blue dot. The relative celestial location of each\nphoton is shown by a red dot whose size indicates the LAT photon event class (class 1 = small dot,\nclass 2 = medium dot, class 3 or 4 = large dot)(Atwood et al. 2009). The photon angular PSFs,\nestimated from the energy, are indicated by the surrounding dotted circles. The green boundary\ncircle with a radius of 16.0\u25e6 provides an angular scale. The plot axes are aligned so that North is\nup and East is to the right.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\u00b11-\u03c3 ranges by finding the crossing points where the integral distributions took on the values of\n0.158655 and 0.841345. The results for each of the four GRB sample sets are listed in Table 2. In\norder of increasingly more stringent GBM fluence requirements, the average number of photons per\nunit area is (0.23, 0.31, 0.53) m\u22122 , consistent with the high-energy/low-energy correlation shown\nin Figure 5 of Zheng et al. 2012c. (The \"Swif t dim GBM\" field has a corresponding flux of 0.30\nphotons m\u22122 .) This fluence trend lends additional support to the evidence of a small but finite\nnumber of GRB photons in the Swif t-triggered co-added fields.\n\nFig. 2.- Cumulative distributions of LAT random fields with 0 to 20 injected GRB photons as a\nfunction of matched filter weight. The red line shows the distribution of matched weights for 1256\nfields obtained by co-adding 46 LAT images but no additional simulated photons. The blue lines\nshow similar distributions for 1256000 simulated fields with 1 to 20 photons added to each. The\nvertical green line indicates the value for the \"Swift GBM\" co-add field.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.\n\nImplications for the number distribution of high energy GRB photons\n\nIn a recently completed paper, we have found that the distribution of GRBs with photons\n> 100 MeV can be characterized by a distribution function that is proportional to the fixed power\nof the number of photons per unit area (Zheng et al. 2012c). This result is shown in Figure 3\nwhich depicts the distribution of actual GRB events, the parent distribution and the distribution\nmodified by the effective area of the LAT detector and analysis event discrimination efficiencies. As\nnoted, the inferred number of possible GRB photons in the Swift co-added fields is relatively small.\nThus for comparison with observation, we can try making the assumption that the GRB number\ndistribution can be extrapolated below the detection threshold that originally defined the fit. We\nfind that if the event distribution function observed at higher LAT fluxes can be extrapolated to\nlower rates, the inclusion of a fraction of all GRBs is sufficient to accommodate the numbers inferred\nfrom our analysis. Pursuing such questions will eventually offer a better insight as to whether high\nenergy photon emission is a generic feature of all bursts or only a special subset.\n\n3.1.\n\nComputing total photon number from a power law distribution\n\nWe need to find an expression for the total number of photons that can be expected from a\nset of bursts that are distributed in photon number according to a power law. Assume the number\nof GRB events emitting n photons per unit area is given by\ndN\n= c * np\ndn\n\n(1)\n\nThe exponent, p, is approximately -1.8, leading to the conclusion that this mathematical\nform is only valid above some minimum threshold value for n which will be designated as nmin .\nNormalizing the integral of dN/dn to unity defines the maximum range over which the power law\nmodel can operate:\n1\nc\n(2)\n) p+1\nnmin = (\u2212\np+1\nFor the problem at hand, we need to compute the total number of photons, \u03bdSwif t , that can be\nexpected in the co-added field corresponding to all Swif t triggers within the co-added set. Each\nGRB event will be characterized by a specific effective area determined by the boresight angle of the\nGRB with respect to the LAT z-axis. The probability of contributing m photons to the co-added\nfield from the i'th GRB event is determined by the Poisson distribution:\nZ \u221e\n(n * ai )m \u2212n*ai dN\ne\ndn\n(3)\npi (m) =\nm!\ndn\nnmin\nwhere ai is the LAT effective area appropriate for the i'th GRB event. The total number of\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nphotons is then given by\n\u03bdSwif t =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm * \u03b7(m)\n\nm=1\n\nNX\nGRB\n\npi (m)\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b7(m) is the probability that an event with m photons would escape normal detection criteria.\nIn practice, this limits the summation over to 8 photons or less. \u03b7(m) was computed by first\nestimating the probability that an event with m photons would have been previously detected by\nthe matched filter weight method described in our earlier papers. This corresponds to a matched\nfilter weight sum of approximately 15.0. An essentially pure sample of high energy GRB photons\nwas obtained from 4 bright GRBs, 080916C, 090510, 090902B and 090926A with 125, 176, 164\nand 177 photons respectively. For each of these burst events, a Monte Carlo program repeatedly\ncomputed the matched filter weight sum for m randomly selected photons to obtain an average\nprobability of exceeding the threshold of 15.0. The independent results for the photon samples from\nthe four bright GRBs were substantially similar and the average for each value of m estimates \u03b7 \u2032 (m),\nthe probability of detection by previous searches. \u03b7(m) is computed immediately as 1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 (m).\nSince dN/dn is simply a power of n, the evaluation of \u03bdSwif t devolves immediately to a summation of terms, each of which can be represented by an incomplete gamma function defined by\nZ \u221e\ntz\u22121 e\u2212t dt\n(5)\n\u0393(z, x) =\nx\n\nSuch functions can be found on familiar mathematical packages such as IDL and Mathematica.\nTaken together, equations 4 & 5 link assumptions about the GRB event photon number distribution\nto the actual number of photons that should be observed for a specified ensemble of exposures. In\nthis way, the results given in Table 2 will lead to limits for these otherwise inaccessible regions of\nthe event photon number distribution.\n\n3.2.\n\nReconciling the Swift-triggered photons and the extrapolated number\ndistribution\n\nAs noted previously, the lower limit of the range for a power-law distribution with negative\nexponent is bounded by the finite number of events it describes. That condition is satisfied by\nsetting the lower bound, nmin , by equation (2). Thus, the obvious first question is how many\nphotons would be expected in the \"Swift GBM\" co-add field if all 46 events obeyed this distribution\nover the range from nmin to \u221e. With nmin defined by equation 2, this can be obtained by application\nof the mathematical relations of equations 4 & 5. For the value of p which best fits the observed\nevent distribution shown in Figure 3, the presumption that all GRBs contribute is clearly violated\nat the 97% confidence level as shown in Figure 2 by overpredicting the number of photons, 14,\ninstead of the observed value of 6 given in Table 2.\nThe obvious next step is to inquire where the lower bound should be set to match the observed\nphoton number. To keep the notation unambiguous, this bound will be designated nthresh and\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Complement of the cumulative GRB event number distribution, N (n), as a function of\nthe LAT high energy photon flux, n. The blue histogram shows the cumulative distribution for the\nLAT-detected events listed in Table 2 of Zheng et al. 2012c. The red curve is the fit to a power-law\ncorrected for detection efficiencies. The black lines show the underlying power-law distribution\nin the region of the fit (solid line), extrapolated to satisfy the number of observed sub-threshold\nquanta (dashed line) and a similarly constrained power-law segment with a slightly greater number\nof events with lower fluxes (dotted line). The arrow marked nmin indicates where an extrapolation\nof the power law distribution to lower values of the photon flux, n, would reach unity, ie. include\nall GRBs.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nnthresh > nmin . For the most probable values for p and \u03bdSwif t, the value for nthresh is 1.7 photons/m2\ncorresponding to 19% of the full GRB sample (nmin = 0.2 photons/m2 ). Varying \u03bdSwif t over the\n\u00b11-\u03c3 range changes the percentage of the contributing GRBs from 11% to 40%. Keeping \u03bdSwif t at\nits central value but varying p over its \u00b11-\u03c3 range changes these percentages by a factor of roughly\ntwo. However if p and \u03bdSwif t are simultaneously set to their 1-\u03c3 upper limits of -1.5 and 10, the\nfraction of GRBs rises to 100%. Admittedly, this extrapolation from present observations relies on\nextrapolation of the photon number distribution to low photon counts. Thus, the analysis should be\nviewed with circumspection but is intended to illustrate the twin constraints of an apparent powerlaw distribution and the limited total number of detected photons associated with a considerable\nnumber of bursts.\nThe abrupt flux cutoff event distribution model described above is an unnatural extreme that\nfavors a few events with fluxes near the current lower detection threshold. An alternative is to\nmodel the differential distribution in the region from zero to the detection threshold as a sum of\ntwo terms chosen to match the fitted distribution at threshold. With the constraint implied by the\ntotal of number of events inferred from the co-added analysis, the cumulative distribution plateaus\nat 24% of all GRBs (see dotted curve in Figure 3). The differential distribution for this segment\nis of the form, a + bnq , where a and b are constants, n is the GRB event flux and q is a fractional\nexponent chosen to match the co-added field photon count. This tends to favor a larger number\nof events at lower fluxes. Thus, despite wide differences in model assumptions, the GRB event\npopulation seems to divide between the \u223c25% that emit high energy radiation and the 75% that\ndon't. We find it exceedingly strange that nature has found a way to limit the number of events with\nhigh energy flux intensities in the 1 to 4 photons/m2 range relative to what occurs at higher fluxes.\nAddressing this question might lead to a better understanding of the GRB high energy emission\nprocess. Finally, the stringent limits for total photon numbers in the various co-added trigger fields\nstrongly suggest that there are very few modest intensity bursts that have gone undetected because\nof inadequate signal processing techniques.\n\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper, we have found a small but statistically significant number of GRB-associated\nphotons for co-added sets of events triggered by the Swift instrument. Although this number has\nlarge statistical errors, it points to a conclusion that high energy photon emission is relatively\ninfrequent and can not be hidden in the somewhat fainter burst events. The necessary initial\nconditions that give rise to this phenomenon are not at all understood. With a larger event sample,\nit may be possible to better classify the population of high energy emitting GRBs and test models\nthat explain their behavior. If nothing else, this analysis again demonstrates the importance of\nGRB detection with good angular resolution.\nWe thank Timothy McKay for constructive suggestions for this manuscript.
