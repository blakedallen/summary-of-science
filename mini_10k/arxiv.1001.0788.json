INTRODUCTION\n\nFor some of the founders of quantum mechanics one of the troubling parts was the spooky\naction-at-a-distance. Originally this was thought\nup by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) in an attempt to challenge certain aspects of quantum\ntheory at the time. Contrary to its original design it is now the cornerstone of modern mainstream quantum physics, from cryptography to\nquantum computation, thus it is important to\nunderstand as many of the properties of quantum communications as possible. In particular\nit is of importance to fully understand the effect of spacetime curvature on EPR states. This\nis completely different from classical information\ntransport. In this scenario the space between observer and emitter does not have an effect on the\ntransmission which means that only local spacetime effects matter when making measurements\non transmissions.\nIn this paper, we apply the Terashima and Ueda\n[1] approach to the spacetime background of a\nKerr-Newman black hole. In general relativity\nthe spin of a particle becomes deformed in all but\nthe Minkowski spacetime. We present a method\nto extract the complete EPR correlation of two\nparticles in a Bell state in Kerr-Newman geometry, ignoring helicity of infalling particles. These\nparticles are defined locally and so suffer a precession of their spin component due an acceleration\nby an external force and the difference in the local\ninertial frame at different points about the given\ngeometry. Taking these differences to arise from\na continuous succession of local Lorentz transformations (LLT), the spin component can be calcu-\n\nlated since it precesses in accord with the Wigner\nrotation. It is therefore not a trivial task to describe the motion of a particle using quantum\nmechanics near a Kerr-Newman black hole because the Poincar\u00e9 group does not act intuitively\nin this region.\nThis paper is organized as follows, in Sec. II we\nderive the spin precession in the Kerr-Newman\nbackground for an observer at infinity. Then in\nSec. III we consider the EPR correlation for a\npair of fully entangled particles. In an attempt\nto remove the coordinate singularities from the\nderived angle we then calculate the spin precession for an infalling observer in Sec. IV. In Sec.\nV we discuss Bell's inequality for the observers\nat infinity and the infalling observer. Finally in\nSec. VI we summarize our results.\n\nII. KERR-NEWMAN DISTORTION\n\nThe most general vacuum solution of Einstein's\nfield equations for black holes is the KerrNewman metric, any further complications requires one to consider hairy black holes. In this\npaper we take the Minkowski signature to be\n\u03b7 = diag(\u2212, +, +, +) and use geometric units\n(G = 1 = c). Latin letters are run over the\nfour inertial labels (0,1,2,3) and Greek letters\nover the four general coordinate labels. Also\nrepeated indices are to be summed. Then the\nmetric for the Kerr-Newman spacetime in BoyerLindquist coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) for an observer at\ninfinity is given by\n\n\f2\n\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd (x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u2212\n\n\u2206\n\u03a3\nsin2 \u03b8\n(dt \u2212 a sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c6)2 + dr2 + \u03a3d\u03b82 +\n(a dt \u2212 (r2 + a2 ) d\u03c6)2\n\u03a3\n\u2206\n\u03a3\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u03a3 (r) = r2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8\n\u2206 (r) = r2 \u2212 2M r + a2 + Q2\n\n(2)\n\nand Q, a and M the charge, angular momentum\nper unit mass and mass of the black hole respectively. For the most part the explicit statement\nof the dependence of Eq.(2) on r will be assumed\nand so it will be suppressed for brevity unless\notherwise stated. Together these three parameters form a family containing a set of all classical\nblack holes. The coordinate system breaks down\ntwice for this metric, firstly for the radial part\nwhen g1rr = 0 then for the time part of the metric when gtt = 0,\np\nr\u00b1 = M \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 \u2212 Q2\nWhere r+(\u2212) is the outer (inner) event horizon.\nIn order to relate local and global coordinates one\nmust introduce a tetrad (or vierbein) formalism,\nwhich we have chosen to be\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\na sin(\u03b8)\na + r2\n\u03bc\n\u221a\n, 0, 0, \u2212 \u221a\ne0 (x) =\n\u2206\u03a3\n\u03a3\n!\nr\n\u2206\ne1\u03bc (x) = 0,\n, 0, 0\n\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ne2\u03bc (x) = 0, 0, \u221a , 0\n\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\n1\n\u221a\ne3\u03bc (x) = \u2212 \u221a\n, 0, 0,\n(3)\n\u2206\u03a3\nsin(\u03b8) \u03a3\n\nt\n\nu (x) = N\n\n\u22121\n\nv\nu\nu\ncosh(\u03b6) = rt\n\nThis describes a local inertial frame for a particle, in this case they are rotating with respect\nto an observer at infinity. In this respect Eq.(3)\nand its inverse are central to relating local and\nglobal coordinates. For example the momentum\nin a local inertial frame pa (x) is ea\u03bc (x) p\u03bc (x) in\nrelation to its global definition. It is imperative\nthat properties can be related locally and globally on a manifold. Henceforth terms not shown\nare vanishing unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nA straight-forward, but tedious calculation yields\nthe components of the connection one-form [8],\n\u03c9\u03bc ab (x) = ea\u03bd (x)\u2207\u03bc eb\u03bd (x), these are a spin connection.

This is an infinitesimal LLT since\n\u03bbab = \u2212\u03bbba .

With constant\nmomentum pa (x) = (m cosh (\u03b6) , 0, 0, m sinh (\u03b6))\npointing in the 3-axis, the change of the spin becomes a rotation as follows.\nAfter an infinitesimal proper time d\u03c4 , the particle moves in the 3-axis by an amount, \u03b4\u03c6 =\nu\u03c6 d\u03c4 . Over this the momentum in the local inertial frame transforms under the LLT, \u039bab (x) =\n\n\u03b4 ab + \u03bbab (x) d\u03c4 , which corresponds to a unitary\noperator that acts on the state of the particle.\nThis operator changes the spin, in particular it\nacts like the unitary matrix U in\nU (\u039b (x)) |pa (x) , \u03c3; xi =\nX (1/2)\nD\u03c30 \u03c3 (W (x)) |\u039bpa (x) , \u03c3 0 ; xi ,\n\u03c30\n\n(18)\nas in [9], where W (x) = W (\u039b (x) , p (x)) =\nL\u22121 (\u039bp) \u039b L (p) is a local Wigner rotation.

This is yet another tediously\nlong equation, so we employ graphical techniques\nin Fig.(2) to illustrate that a singularity is evident at the event horizon r+ .

Two observers are considered at azimuthal angles \u00b1\u03a6 with r > r+ and an\nEPR source generator at \u03a6 = 0 as seen in Fig.\n(3). The observers and EPR source are static in\nthe local inertial frame Eq.(3), i.e. they are relatively static. The EPR source generates a pair\nof maximally entangled particles at \u03a6 = 0 which\nare sent in opposite directions with constant four\nmomentum pa\u00b1 = (m cosh (\u03b6) , 0, 0, \u00b1m sinh (\u03b6)).\nThe pure state can be described by the Bell state,\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n\u221a |pa+ , \u2191; 0i |pa\u2212 , \u2193; 0i \u2212 |pa+ , \u2193; 0i |pa\u2212 , \u2191; 0i ,\n2\n(25)\n\n\f6\nr\n\u03b813\nr\n\n(\nb)\n\n(\na)\n\nFIG. 2: The rotation angle for a Kerr-Newman black hole with parameters M = 1000, a = 0.8M and Q = 0.2M\nfor the figure on the left and, M = 1000, a = 0.9M and Q = 0.1M for the one on the right, and both with\nv = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for the black, thick, dashed and thick dashed lines respectively.\n\nwhere for notational simplicity we put the\n\u03c6\u2212coordinate in the state argument. After a\nproper time \u03a6/u\u03c6 (since there is zero azimuthal\nacceleration) the particles reach their respective\nobservers. An induced spin precession is observed because of the curved nature of the spacetime background, this is called the local Wigner\nrotation and in this case is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec 0 cos(\u0398) 0 \u00b1 sin(\u0398) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nW ab (\u00b1\u03c6, 0) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed0\n0\n1\n0\n0 \u2213 sin(\u0398) 0 cos(\u0398)\n(26)\nwhere\nr\n\u0398=\u03a6\n\u03b81\n(27)\nsinh(\u03b6) 3\n\nwhere T is a time ordering operator and the exponent is the Taylor series exponent of the whole\nmatrix. In this situation however the time ordering term is not needed since \u03b8ab (x) is constant\nduring the motion of the particle (assuming that\nmass is not injected in to the system during this\ntime).\nThe significant terms of the spin representation,\ni.e. the unity ones, can be condensed in to a Pauli\nrepresentation as follows\n\nwhich is similar but not identical to the case for\nwhen a = 0 = Q since the \u0398 is different. The\ninduced precession arises from Eq.(18), which\nmoves in accord to the local Wigner rotation.

This is where the entanglement appears to breakdown because of the\npresence of the spin triplet state in the state description. First of all however we remove the trivial rotation that rotates the local inertial frames\nby \u00b1\u03a6 as in Eq.(21). about the 2-axis at \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03a6.\nThis is achieved through rotating the bases by\n\n\f7\n\u2213\u03a6 about the 2-axis at \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03a6 respectively,\n\u03a6\n0\n|pa\u00b1 , \u2191; \u00b1\u03a6i = cos( ) |pa\u00b1 , \u2191; \u00b1\u03a6i\n2\n\u03a6\n\u00b1 sin( ) |pa\u00b1 , \u2193; \u00b1\u03a6i ,\n2\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\n\u03a6\n0\n|pa\u00b1 , \u2193; \u00b1\u03a6i = \u2213 sin( ) |pa\u00b1 , \u2191; \u00b1\u03a6i\n2\n\u03a6 a\n+ cos( ) |p\u00b1 , \u2193; \u00b1\u03a6i ,\n2\n\n(37)\n\nAs in [1],\n1 h\n\u221a cos(\u2206) |pa+ , \u2191; \u03a6i0 |pa\u2212 , \u2193; \u2212\u03a6i0\n2\n0\n0\u0001\n\u2212 |pa+ , \u2193; \u03a6i |pa\u2212 , \u2191; \u2212\u03a6i\n0\n\n0\n\n+ sin(\u2206) |pa+ , \u2191; \u03a6i |pa\u2212 , \u2191; \u2212\u03a6i\ni\n0\n0\u0001\n+ |pa+ , \u2193; \u03a6i |pa\u2212 , \u2193; \u2212\u03a6i\n\nhowever only local unitary operations have been\napplied and the entanglement is invariant under\nunitary operations. Hence this must be an affect of the acceleration and gravity. If the pure\nstate can be recovered then quantum computations may still be done while in the presence of\na gravitational field. In particular the respective\nobservers at \u03c6 = \u00b1\u03a6 must take measurements at\nan angle \u2213\u0398 in their local inertial frames. Since\n\u03b8ab (x) 6= \u03c7ab (x) a parallel transport would not\nreproduce this angle. Hence by transforming in\nthe appropriate direction the full EPR correlation may still be recovered.\nNow it was found that \u2206 is positive for r \u2192 \u221e\nto a radius r0 very close to the outer horizon r+ .\nAs r becomes smaller than r0 and furthermore\nr \u2193 r+ , \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and thus to extract the perfect\nEPR correlation each observer would require infinite accuracy in the measurement that even a\nsmall error would lead to a mixed state element.\n\n(38)\nIV.

The observer\ncan now fall through the apparent singularities\nof the Kerr-Newman spacetime observed by an\nobserver at infinity. For this observer the line\nelement is given by\n\n(2M R\u2212Q2 ) 2\n\u03a9\n2\n\n\u03a3 = R + a cos2 (\u03b8)\n\n\u00011/2\n\n(41)\n\nand the time coordinate coincides with the\nproper time for the free fall observer. The vierbein is now chosen to be,\n\u1ebd0\u03bc (x) = (1, 0, 0, 0)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a9\n\u03a9 \u03a3\n\u1ebd1\u03bc (x) = b , , 0, \u2212a b sin2 (\u03b8)\n\u03a3 \u03a9\n\u03a3\n\u1ebd2\u03bc (x) = (0, 0, \u03a3, 0)\n\u1ebd3\u03bc (x) = (0, 0, 0, \u03a9 sin (\u03b8))\n\n(42)\n\n\u00152\n\n+ \u03a32 d\u03b82 + \u03a92 sin2 (\u03b8) d\u03c62\n\n(40)\n\nIn the (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) coordinates the vierbein inherited the r+ and r\u2212 coordinate singularities, the\nabove (T, R, \u03b8, \u03c6) also act as the metric does at\nthose radii, and since the metric is singularity\nfree there so is the vierbein. Now similarly to\nEq.(5) we take a four velocity of the form,\n\n\f8\n\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0169T (x) = \u00d1 \u22121 cosh \u03b6\u0303\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011 sinh \u03b6\u0303\n\u0169\u03c6 (x) = \u00d1 \u22121 \u00d1 \u03c6 cosh \u03b6\u0303 + \u221a\ng\u03c6\u03c6\n\nwhere \u03b6\u0303 is the rapidity in the (T, R, \u03b8, \u03c6) local\ninertial frame. However constraining the two\nfree variables \u00d1 \u22121 and \u00d1 \u03c6 by the normalization\nequation u\u03bd u\u03bd = \u22121 yields\n\u0001\na Q2 \u2212 2M R\n(44)\n\u00d1 =\n\u22122a2 M R + a2 Q2 \u2212 a2 R2 \u2212 R4\np\n\u22122a2 RM + a2 Q2 \u2212 a2 R2 \u2212 R4\np\n\u00d1 \u03c6 = \u00b1\n(45)\nR \u2206 (R)\nThe four velocity thus emerges out of the normalization condition. Now Eq.(45) clearly will be\nsingular on both horizons since they are defined\nas the solution to \u2206 = 0. In this way we find that\neven a freely falling observer can not extract the\nEPR correlation at and beyond the event horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole. Thus no such\nobserver can exist in this scenario which we attribute this to the strength of the frame dragging\neffects at the outer horizon since observers may\nbe defined in the Schwarzschild black hole [1].\nThe result is a little surprising however it follows\nfrom the intrinsic nature of the Kerr-Newman\nblack hole that no observer of this kind may be\ndefined globally which is what would be required\nto make measurements on a bi-local property.\nFurthermore following the same method as with\nthe observer at infinity, the local Wigner rotation\nalso turns out not to be finite on and beyond the\nout horizon which is a clear consequence of the\nabsence of observability and not the lost of the\nEPR correlation. Hence it is the inability of an\nobserver, so defined, to make measurements that\nrestrict the regions where the EPR correlation\ncan be extracted successfully.\n\nV. MAXIMUM VIOLATION OF BELL'S\nINEQUALITY\n\nAs in [1] we examined circularly moving particles in a local inertial frame. Similarly we\nmeasure the spin of one particle in the (1, 0, 0)direction (component Q) or in the (0, 1, 0)direction (component R) and the other particle in the (\u22121, \u22121, 0)-direction (component S) or\n(1, \u22121, 0)-direction (components T) in the local\ninertial frames \u03c6 = \u03a6 and \u03c6 = \u2212\u03a6 respectively.\n\n(43)\n\nIn the Kerr-Newman geometry a decrease in the\nmaximal violation of Bell's inequality is observed,\nin particular as\n\u221a\nhQSi+hRSi+hRT i\u2212hQT i = 2 2 cos2 (\u0398) (46)\n\nThis however still includes the trivial rotation Eq.(21) which could be causing the\ndecrease in maximal violation of Bell's inequality.\nRotating the components by \u2213\u03a6.\nThe new spin components then become,\n(cos (\u03a6) , 0, \u2212 sin (\u03a6))-direction (component Q0 )\nor (0, 1, 0)-direction (component R0 ) for one particle and \u221a12 (\u2212 cos (\u03a6) , \u22121, \u2212 sin (\u03a6))-direction\n(component S 0 ) or \u221a12 (cos (\u03a6) , \u22121, sin (\u03a6))direction (component T 0 ) for the other one. The\nviolation of Bell's inequality still reduces from\nmaximal as,\n\u221a\nhQ0 S 0 i + hR0 S 0 i + hR0 T 0 i \u2212 hQ0 T 0 i = 2 2 cos2 (\u2206)\n(47)\nThis is due to the gravitational field and accelerations involved. Taking in to account the general relativistic effect on spin measurements are\nthus take in the directions (cos (\u0398) , 0, \u2212 sin (\u0398))direction or (0, 1, 0)-direction for one particle and \u221a12 (\u2212 cos (\u0398) , \u22121, \u2212 sin (\u0398))-direction or\n\u221a1 (cos (\u0398) , \u22121, sin (\u0398)) for the other one in the\n2\nsame respective local inertial frames. However\nas the radius where the experiment takes place\nreduces to the outer horizon, a small error can\nbuild up which still causes maximal entanglement\nto be lost. This corresponds to a requirement of\ninfinite accuracy in making measurements as the\nobserver approaches infinitely close to the horizon.\nConsidering next the freely falling observer\nEq.(42), the angle of precession is observed to\nbecome infinite on and beyond the outer event\nhorizon r+ since the observer looses the ability to\ntake such measurements. Thus on the equatorial\nplane the EPR correlation can not be extracted\nand so infers a region where information may be\nlost for such an observer making measurements\nlocally.\n\n\f9\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe considered the EPR correlation of two accelerated particles in a Kerr-Newman background\nand found that the correlation apparently decreases as seen in the directions of flat spacetime\nas does the degree of violation of Bell's inequality. We derived the Wigner rotation and showed\nthat maximal violation of Bell's inequality can be\nachieved through appropriate coordinate transformations of the local inertial frames. In this\nnew inertial frame the EPR correlation can be\nextracted up to the outer event horizon which is\nto be expected for an observer at infinity.\nHowever at the outer horizon r+ and below, for\nboth the observer at infinity and the free fall observer, the EPR correlation is unmeasurable. In\nparticular the rotation angle for an observer approaches negative infinity on both counts and so\nthe correlation will not be extracted once both\nparticles have gone over the outer even horizon.\nThis occurs because the flow of spacetime itself\ndoes not allow the experimental set up required\nto extract the EPR correlation. Hence due to\nframe dragging effects becoming so intense one\ncannot achieve the relatively static condition required for extraction and so no further measurements may be made on the particles in question\nwhich means that the information stored in their\nspin states will become irrecoverable. Despite the\napparent loss of information as measured by such\nan observer, it is actually stored by the black hole\nup to the singularity where theory fails to predict\nwhat will happen.\n\nThis work would not have been possible without\nthe support and hospitality of Professor Steve\nRawlings (Astrophysics, University of Oxford)\nand for this we thank him.
