Studying the chemical compositions and colormagnitude diagrams (CMDs) of globular clusters (GCs) in\nthe nearby low-mass galaxies is critical to compare properties of these long-living objects situated in galaxies of different type and mass. Only the Local group (LG) dwarf\ngalaxies are close enough so that their globular clusters can\nbe resolved into single red giant and horizontal branch stars\nby today's observatories.\nThree close companions of the Andromeda galaxy,\nNGC 147, NGC 185 and NGC 205, comprise the brightest end of the LG dwarf early-type galaxy luminosity function. The proximity to M31 in combination with the un\u22c6\n\nE-mail:\nsme@sao.ru\ntpuzia@stsci.edu (THP)\n\n(MES);\n\nvafan@sao.ru\n\n(VLA);\n\nusual properties of these three galaxies have attracted great\nattention of astronomers since the beginning of the 20th century (we refer the reader to a monograph by Van den Bergh\n2000 and a review by Mateo 1998 for details). NGC 205\nand NGC 185 are very unusual galaxies and do not resemble any galaxy within \u223c 10 Mpc. Both have a regular\nspheroidal shape and are composed mainly of old stars. At\nthe same time, both galaxies have a considerable amount\nof gas, dust, and a significant intermediate-age stellar component. These unique properties are most likely tightly related their unusual evolutionary histories (e.g. Yong & Lo,\n1997; Davidge, 1992; Lee et al., 1993; Butler & MartinezDelgado, 2005; Davidge, 2005). Compared to its brighter\ncousins, NGC 147 is gas and dust free. Asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars contribute only 2-3% of the total light\nof this galaxy (Davidge, 1994). By means of its stellar content, NGC 147 resembles a typical dwarf spheroidal galaxy\nin the Local Group. However, it is much more luminous.\nThe distance to NGC 205, NGC 185 and NGC 147, their\nstellar populations and star formation histories are being\n\n\f2\n\nM. E. Sharina, V. L. Afanasiev, and T. H.

All searches of\nGCs were carried out on photographic plates. The clusters\nwere classified as being associated with the galaxies by their\ngalactocentric radius. However, recent studies of GCSs in\ndwarf galaxies reveal globular clusters situated far from optical bodies of their host galaxies (see e.g. Hwang et al. 2005).\nIt is likely that detailed wide-field investigations may dis-\n\nTable 3.

Four extended globular clusters were discovered in\nthe outer halo of M31 by Huxor et al., 2005) using INTWFS images. Recent HST based surveys reveal new globular cluster candidates in M31 (Barmby & Huchra 2001, see\nalso the summary of optical and IR photometry in Galleti et\nal. 2004). For instance, there are \u223c 50 objects in the catalog\nof Galleti et al. (2004) within a radius of 20.\u2032 around the\ncenter of NGC 205. Galleti et al. (2006) emphasize that our\nknowledge about the M31 GCS is far from complete even\nin terms of simple membership and undertake a large spectroscopic survey of bona-fide globular clusters and cluster\ncandidates in M31. Obtaining radial velocities for GCs in\nthe M31 halo and in the dwarf galaxies, detailed CMD and\nabundance studies will certainly help to solve the problem\nof the origin of M31 and of the satellite galaxies.\nThe properties of the globular clusters in NGC 147,\nNGC 185 and NGC 205 from the literature are summarised\nin Table 2. Da Costa and Mould (1988) first obtained spectra for eight Hubble clusters, the nucleus of NGC 205, FJJ77\nclusters I\u2013V in NGC 185 and for the two clusters Hodge I\nand III in NGC 147. A comparison of line strengths relative to similar spectra of Galactic globular clusters indicated that with a single exception, of the central GC Hubble V in NGC 205, all the clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185\nand NGC 205 are old and metal-poor. The age estimates for\nHubble V fall in a wide range from \u223c 300 Myr (based on\nBV R photometry, Lee, 1996) to intermediate ages (based\non optical and far-ultraviolet imaging with HST/WFPC2,\nJones et al., 1996). Star cluster formation seems to be a\nmore extended process in NGC 185. A star forming region\nof H\u03b1 + [N II] emission with a diameter of 50 pc near the\ncenter of NGC 185 may be a probable place of a massive\nyoung star cluster birth according to a modern evolutionary\nscheme (Gallagher & Grebel, 2001 and references therein).\nYoung & Lo (1997) estimated the mass of the brightest central HI clump in NGC 185 MHI = 0.7 * 104 M\u2299 and the\ncorresponding virial mass a factor of 100 higher. The clump\nis associated with a massive giant molecular cloud.\nIn this paper, we derive ages, metallicities, and [\u03b1/Fe]\nratios for globular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185 and\nNGC 205 based on measurements of absorption line indices\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

The main advantage of this system is its ability to disentangle age from metallicity using the information on the strength of prominent diagnostic absorption line\nfeatures measured in the intermediate-resolution integratedlight spectra.\nThe paper is organised as follows.

Fig. 1 shows DSS-2-red images\nof NGC 147 and NGC 185 with marked globular clusters as\nwell as the 6-m telescope image of NGC 205 with marked\nsettings of the slits and an image of the corresponding raw\nspectra. In multi-slit mode SCORPIO has 16 movable slits\n(1.\u2032\u2032 2 x 18.\u2032\u2032 0) in the field of 2.\u2032 9 x 5.\u2032 9 in the focal plane of the\ntelescope. We use the CCD detector EEV42-40 with 2048 x\n2048 pixel elements and the scale \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 18 per pixel. The grism\nGR1200g (1200 lines/mm) gives a spectral resolution \u223c 5 \u00c5.\nThe exact spectral coverage of an individual spectrum depends on the distance of the slit position from the meridian\nof the field. Most of our spectra have good wavelength coverage between 4200 \u2212 5800 \u00c5. Slit positions were set based\non pre-imaging obtained with the same instrument.\nA journal of observations is given in Table 3. Globular\nclusters covered by one slitmask pointing are listed in one\nrow. All objects, including standard stars, were observed\nwith the same setup of the multi-slit unit. Resulting spectra of the globular clusters and of diffuse light are shown in\nFig. 2. The detailed description of all reduction steps is given\nin Sharina et al. (2005). Here we briefly review major points\nof our reduction strategy. The basic data reduction was carried out using software packages within the Interactive Data\nLanguage (IDL). The subsequent data analysis was carried\nout in MIDAS. The data reduction included removing cosmics, bias subtraction, flat-field correction, and correction of\ngeometric field distortion. After wavelength calibration and\nsky subtraction, aperture windows in the direction of the\nspatial axis were defined, and the spectra were extracted by\nsumming the two-dimensional spectra in the spatial direction. Then the spectra were corrected for atmospheric ex-\n\nFigure 2.

Age, [Z/H], and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios obtained with our fitting routine (see Section 2.3) for Galactic globular clusters (GCCs) (filled\ncircles) using the Lick index data of Puzia et al. (2002) are compared with the ages obtained from CMD studies (Salaris & Weiss, 2002),\n[Fe/H] data from Harris (1996), and [\u03b1/Fe] values from Pritzl et al. (2005). Age, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] obtained in this work with our code\nfor M31 GCS (open circles) using the Lick index data from Worthey et al. (1994), Kuntschner et al. (2002), Beasley et al. (2004) and\nPuzia et al. (2005a) are compared with ages, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] from Puzia et al. (2005a).

We use spectroscopic Lick\nstandard stars, observed in the same night through the central slit of the slit mask, for flux calibration of all spectra. In\nthose nights when radial velocity standard stars were not observed, we use spectra of the twilight sky to compute radial\nvelocities relative to telluric lines. In addition to the spectra of globular clusters, we analysed spectra of the diffuse\ngalaxy light in the same way. These spectra were obtained\nnear the cluster FJJIII in NGC 185 and in fields f1 \u2013 f5 in\nNGC 205 (see Fig. 2 for details).\n\n2.2\n\nCalibration of Lick indices\n\nBefore measuring indices, we degraded our spectra to the\nresolution of the Lick system, taking into account its\nwavelength-dependent resolution (Worthey & Ottaviani,\n1997). The effective resolution of our spectra has been determined using spectra of standard stars as a width (FWHM)\n\u221a\nof the corresponding autocorrelation function divided by 2\n(Tonry & Davis 1979). The resolution-correction technique\nis described in detail in Puzia et al. (2002). Lick indices were\nmeasured on spectra corrected for radial velocities (Table 7),\nwith a typical radial velocity error of \u223c 30 km s\u22121 . Chilingarian et al. (2005) measured radial velocities for GCs FJJIV\nand HodgeII according to our request using his method and\nobtained Vh = \u2212182 \u00b1 12 and Vh = \u2212128 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 , correspondingly, in very good agreement with our measurements.\nThe spectra of diffuse galactic light were corrected for velocity dispersion determined using algorithms of Tonry &\nDavis (1979). Broadening of lines in the spectra of diffuse\ngalactic light due to velocity dispersion for the fields f1 \u2013\nf5 in NGC 205 and the field in NGC 185, accordingly, was\nobtained to be 1.5 \u00b10.3 \u00c5, 1.5 \u00b10.3 \u00c5, 1.4 \u00b10.3 \u00c5, 1.3 \u00b10.3\n\u00c5, 1.3 \u00b10.3 \u00c5, 1.1 \u00b10.3 \u00c5, 0.9 \u00b10.5 \u00c5. The velocity dispersion determined by us for the central parts of the galaxies is\nslightly larger than that from the literature (Carter & Sadler\n1990, Bender et al. 1991, Prugniel & Soubiran 2001), but\nstill well within the errors. Table 4 summarizes zero points\n\nof the linear transformation of our index measurements to\nthe Lick/IDS standard system with the corresponding rms\nerrors. We obtained these zeropoints from observations of\nstandard stars listed in Table 3. These zeropoints coincide\nwell within the errors with those obtained in other nights\nfrom observations of a large set of Lick standard stars with\nthe multi-slit unit of the SCORPIO spectrograph equipped\nwith a grism VPHG1200g which provides a spectral resolution \u223c 5 \u00c5 (Sharina et al., 2006). Lick indices were measured\nusing the code GONZO (Puzia et al. 2002). The Lick index\nuncertainties were determined from bootstrapping the object spectrum. All index values and the errors for observed\nglobular clusters, diffuse-light fields, and combined spectra\nof globular clusters are presented in Tables 5 and 6.\n2.3\n\nAges, metallicities and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios\n\nIn the following we compute ages, metallicities, [Z/H] 1 , and\n[\u03b1/Fe] for our sample globular clusters using the information\nacquired from the measurements of the Lick indices.\n\n2.3.1\n\nA three-dimensional interpolation and \u03c72\nminimization routine\n\nWe developed a program for age, metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe] determination which involves fitting all available Lick indices\nusing the SSP model predictions of Thomas et al. (2004).\nOur three-dimensional linear interpolation routine obtains a\nfull set of theoretical Lick indices from required ages, [Z/H],\nand [\u03b1/Fe] ratios by minimization of the \u03c72 function:\n\u03c72 =\n\n\u00132\nN \u0012\nX\nIi \u2212 Ii (age, [Z/H], [\u03b1/Fe])\ni=1\n\n1\n\n\u03c3Ii\n\n,\n\nWe use the standard definition, [X/Y ] = log(X/Y ) \u2212\nlog(X\u2299 /Y\u2299 ), where X and Y are masses of specific elements.\nA designation [Z/H] implies the overall metallicity.\n\n\f6\n\nM.

The program computes 95% confidence intervals and 1-\u03c3 errors of ages, [Z/H], and [\u03b1/Fe]. Our routine\nworks entirely within the three-dimensional space defined\nby the model grids. The ranges of estimated values are Age:\n[1 \u00f7 15] Gyr, [Z/H] : [\u22122.25 \u00f7 0.35] dex, and [\u03b1/Fe] : [0 \u00f7 0.5]\ndex. The program makes determinations based on 100 combinations of initial conditions randomly distributed within\nthis three-dimensional space, and the most frequent event\n\nis taken as a value of the global minimum. The errors in\nage, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] depend primarily on random index\nuncertainties and uncertainties of transformations to the\nLick/IDS standard system.\nTo test our routine we compare ages, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe]\nobtained by our program using the SSP model predictions\nfrom Thomas et al. (2004) with the ones available in the\nliterature for 12 Galactic and 46 M31 globular clusters\n(see Figure 3).

(2004), and Puzia et al. (2005a). The data\non ages, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] for M31 GCs were taken from\nPuzia et al. (2005a), and the Lick index data for Galactic globular clusters from Puzia et al. (2002). When applying our fitting routine to these Lick index data we use\nall available indices except for CN1 and CN2. We found\nthat CN1 and CN2 increase the 1-\u03c3 errors of our results\nand can even skew them (see Proctor et al., 2004). Figure 3\ndemonstrates linear correlations between our determinations\nof age, metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe] and the the corresponding data\nfrom the literature. We found the following linear relations:\nAgelit = Ageour + 1.3 Gyr, [\u03b1/Fe]lit = [\u03b1/Fe]our \u2212 0.02 dex,\n\n[Fe/H]lit = 0.93 * [Z/H]our \u2212 0.2 dex for the sample of MW\nGCs, and [Z/H]lit = 1.02 * [Z/H]our + 0.08 dex for M31 GCs.\nOnly three of the sample Galactic globular clusters have\n[\u03b1/Fe] measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of\nstars in 45 Milky Way globular clusters by Pritzl et al.\n(2005). We find that our results for Galactic GCs are close to\nthe literature data. However, the data for M31 GCs scatter\nrelative to the best least-square fit shown by a solid line on\nthe third panel in Figure 3 with a rms error \u223c0.2 dex. More\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars in young and\nof low-[\u03b1/Fe] GCs are needed to determine the real accuracy\nof our [\u03b1/Fe] determination method. It should be pointed\nout that the relative error \u2206Age/Age is fairly constant at\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205\naround 0.3. Unfortunately, there are no GCs with young ages\nand low-[\u03b1/Fe] in our comparison sample to check for potential biases in our spectroscopic age estimates. The middle\npanel of Figure 3 shows a tight correlation between [Fe/H]\ndata from Harris for Galactic GCs (1996) and our estimates.\nThe existence of the tight correlation between [Fe/H] data\nfor Galactic GCs and [Z/H] values from SSP models was also\nnoticed by Thomas et al. (2003) and Proctor et al. (2004).\nProctor et al. (2004) referred this result to problems in the\ncalibration of the Lick indices or the metallicity scale in SSP\nmodels. According to our exercise the [Fe/H]-[Z/H] correlation is not a one-to-one relation.\n\n2.3.2\n\nResults\n\nResulting ages, metallicities, and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios obtained with\nour routine for GCs, diffuse-light fields and the stacked spectra of GCs in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205 are listed\nin Table 7. 1-\u03c3 uncertainties of our results for each object\nare summarized in Table 7.\nFor all studied globular clusters we construct agemetallicity and [\u03b1/Fe] diagnostic plots (see Fig. 4) similar to the techniques described in Puzia et al. (2005b).\nIt is of interest to see whether the information coming from the age-metallicity plots coincides well with\nthe results obtained by applying of our fitting routine.\nWe use the SSP model predictions of Thomas et al.\n(2004) and an [\u03b1/Fe]-insensitive metallicity index [MgFe]\u2032 =\n{Mgb * (0.72 * Fe5270 + 0.28 * Fe5335)}1/2 .\nInspection of Fig. 4 shows that for those globular clusters with multiple Balmer line indices the ages, metallicities,\nand [\u03b1/Fe] ratios derived from different diagnostic plots are\nconsistent with each other. The location of objects in these\ndiagrams correspond well with our fitting results (Table 7).\nThe problem of age determination for very metal-poor globular clusters arises, first, since the model lines cross in this\nregion, and, second, because GCs tend to fall below the oldest model sequence (see Covino et al. 1995).\nOur results reveal solar [\u03b1/Fe] ratios for most of our\nsample globular clusters, which is consistent with slow\nand/or extended globular-cluster/star formation histories in\ntheir host dSph galaxies. Low [\u03b1/Fe] enhancements were also\nfound in individual red giant stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) with high-dispersion spectroscopy (e.g. Shetrone,\nBolte & Stetson 1998, Smecker-Hane & McWilliam 1999,\nBonifacio et al. 2000, Shetrone et al. 2001, Shetrone et al.\n2003, Tolstoy et al. 2003, Geisler et al. 2005). Shetrone et al.\n(2001) and Tolstoy et al. (2003) suggested that the low abundance ratios at low metallicities could result from a slow star\nformation rate. Tolstoy et al. suggested that dSph galaxies\nexperienced a fairly uniform chemical evolution despite their\ndifferent SF histories. This conclusion was backed by theoretical model predictions (see e.g. Lanfranchi & Matteucci,\n2003).\nSuppose that our three samples of globular clusters\nwith measured ages, [Z/H], and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios in NGC 147,\nNGC 185, and NGC 205 were drawn from the same\nnormally-distributed parent populations. To check the hypothesis we compare our three samples in pairs and apply\nthe F-test (comparison of variances) and Student's t-test\n(comparison of means, see e.g. Stuart & Ord 1994). The re-\n\n9\n\nTable 7. Ages, [\u03b1/Fe] and [Z/H] for globular clusters and diffuselight regions for our sample galaxies.

The\nF-test shows that at a significance level of 5% the variances\nare equal. That is the quotient of two variances is always less\nthan the corresponding critical valuep\nof F-distribution. We\ncompute the T-statistics T = t1\u2212p s 1/n1 + 1/n2 , where\nt1\u2212p is a critical value of T-distribution at a significance\nlevel of 1 \u2212 p; n1 and n2 are numbers of degrees of freedom\nin the first and the second samples, and s is a mean weighted\n(n \u22121)s2 +(n \u22121)s2\n\n2\n1\n2\nvariance s2 = 1 n1 +n\n, where s1 and s2 are vari2 \u22122\nances for the two samples. One can see from Table 8 that\nthe difference between mean values for the three samples\ntaken in pairs is always less than the corresponding T value.\nHence, at a significance level of 5% the [\u03b1/Fe] enhancements\nfor the studied globular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and\nNGC 205 have similar approximately zero values.\n\n2.3.3\n\nIndividual globular cluster systems\n\nNGC 205: We stack the spectra of the diffuse galaxy in\nNGC 205 in order to achieve a higher S/N.

However, the metallicity of Hubble V\nappears to be lower than that of the surrounding fields. On\nthe other hand, the second nearest globular cluster to the\noptical center of NGC 205, Hubble VI, has about the same\nmetallicity but an older age relative to the very central stellar population. Finally, the more metal-poor globular clusters Hubble I, Hubble II, and Hubble VII are the oldest GCs\nin NGC 205. All three clusters are located at large galactocentric distances. Hence, our measurements show that there\nis a tendency of increasing age with increasing galactocentric distance for stellar populations in NGC 205. This fact is\nconfirmed by extensive CMD studies of stellar populations\nin NGC 205 as it will be shown in Section 4.3.\nNGC 185: This galaxy hosts eight off-center globular\nclusters. All of them are located at the projected distance\ndproj =[0.6 \u2013 1.0] kpc from the optical center of the galaxy,\nexcept FJJIII with dproj = 0.2 kpc. Fig. 4 shows that all\nobserved GCs in NGC 185 are old and metal-poor with the\nexception of FJJVII, which appears to be the youngest and\nmost metal-rich globular cluster in NGC 185 (see Tab. 7).\nFJJVII has approximately the same age and metallicity as\nHubbleVI in NGC 205 according to our measurements. The\ndiagnostic plots and Table 7 show that the stacked spectrum\nof these two clusters shows the same intermediate-age and\nmetallicity. Those two globular clusters may have formed\nsome 4-6 Gyr ago. It will be shown in Sect. 4.2 that similar\nintermediate-age and metallicity GCs exist in the halo of\nM31.\nNGC 147: All three observed globular clusters in\nNGC 147 are old and metal-poor, similar to what is found\nfor globular clusters in NGC 185. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that\nthe chemical compositions obtained from the stacked spectra for all GCs except FJJVII in NGC 185 (filled square),\nNGC 147 (filled diamond) and GCs Hubble I, and VII in\nNGC 205 (filled circle), as well as for all old and low metallicity GCs in NGC 185 and NGC 147 (filled triangle), coincide\nwithin the errors.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nSTELLAR PHOTOMETRY DATA\nData Reduction\n\nIn order to test whether our spectroscopic results are consistent with fundamental parameters derived from CMDs,\nwe search the HST archive for available photometry for\nour sample globular clusters. Table 9 summarises the result of our search, which recovered useful WFPC2 data for\neight globular clusters. We use the HSTphot package (Dolphin, 2000a) to perform stellar photometry and artificial\nstar tests. We use the charge transfer efficiency and zeropoint magnitude correction derived by Dolphin (2000b).\nStars with S/N > 5, |\u03c7| > 20, and |sharpness| > 0.4, were\neliminated from the final photometry list. The uncertainty\nof transformations from the WFPC2 instrumental system\nto the standard Johnson-Cousins system contains many factors. The most important of them are uncertainties of photometric zeropoints (\u223c0.m 003 for the F555W filter, \u223c0.m 002 for\nF814W filter), the CTE correction (\u223c0.m 01) and the aperture corrections (\u223c0.m 05) (Dolphin, 2000b).\n\n3.2\n\nColor-Magnitude and Hess Diagrams\n\nIn order to avoid crowding we analyze in the following only\nglobular clusters imaged with the PC chip (0.\u2032\u2032 0455/pixel).\nOne exception is the cluster Hodge II which is located in a\nvery sparse field of NGC 147 and is imaged with the WF3\nchip of WFPC2. However, the surrounding field of this cluster is sparse enough to provide reliable stellar photometry. In\ngeneral, photometric data for globular clusters imaged with\nlower resolution and/or located in the central dense regions\nof the galaxies reveal too high photometric errors to confidently determine ages and [Fe/H]. We calculate absolute\nstellar magnitudes using reddening and distance estimates\nlisted in Table 1.\nFig. 5 shows CMDs and Hess diagrams for stars within\nthe RGC radius for all our sample GCs. 2 We consider the\nradius of a GC to be defined by the full area occupied by the\nbluest stars (old HB stars). To illustrate how RGC was derived, we demonstrate spatial distribution of blue stars in the\nglobular cluster FJJI along X axis (Fig. 6). Blue stars with\nV \u2212 I < 0.2 were selected in a 200 by 800 pixel rectangular\narea centered on the cluster. The distribution shows a clear\nmaximum towards the center of the cluster. Similar distributions were constructed for each of the studied clusters in\nX and Y directions, and the determined two values of RGC\nwere averaged. We adopt the size roughly 10 \u2013 20% smaller\nthan the full area outlined by blue stars to reduce contamination effects. This area roughly corresponds to RGC at a\nlevel of the number of blue stars: Nback + \u03c3(N ), where Nback\nis the mean number of blue stars around the studied cluster,\nand \u03c3(N ) is the standard deviation of this number. Structural parameters of globular clusters in NGC 205, NGC 185\nand NGC 147 will be studied in our follow-up paper. Here\nwe note that the sizes of the clusters measured using the distributions of blue stars are \u223c 3 \u2212 4 times larger than the corresponding effective radii. For example, FJJI has re = 1.\u2032\u2032 2,\n2\n\nThe figures for each globular cluster can be downloaded from the anonymous ftp site: ftp.sao.ru (directory:\n/pub/sme/GCsM31dEs).\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205\n\n11\n\nFigure 5.

It should be noted that central\nregions of the clusters do not show the presence of resolved\nstars which pass our goodness-of-fit criteria. This fact was\ntaken into account in selection of field stars surrounding a\ncluster. The area for selection of such stars was computed\n2\nas S \u2032 = \u03c0(RGC\n\u2212 Rc2 ), where RGC is the radius of a globular\ncluster determined via spatial distribution of blue stars and\nRc is the radius of the central unresolved area.\nFig. 5 consists of four panels for each globular cluster.\nAn uncleaned CMD for stars within RGC of each globular cluster is illustrated in the left panel. Empirical loci of\nRGBs for Galactic globular clusters are shown for comparison (Lee et al., 1993). CMDs for field stars from an equal\narea is shown in the second panel. The third panel represents the difference between recovered magnitude and input\nmagnitude for recovered stars obtained from artificial star\ntests. It is clear that systematic effects do not exceed 0.m 05\nfor stars with the completeness limit of > 50%, which is indicated by a dotted line. Given the quality of the data we\nare able to estimate the horizontal branch morphology index\n(see below) with a high level of confidence.\nThe forth panel represents Hess-diagrams after decontamination from the field contribution. The statistical field\nsubtraction was done in the following way: 1. We constructed\na Hess-diagram for stars within RGC of each globular cluster.\n2. Similar Hess-diagrams were obtained for stars surrounding the corresponding globular cluster. To take into account\nstatistical fluctuations of the number of stars we consider\nstars in an annulus around the studied cluster. Our simulations show that four separate areas around the studied cluster are representative enough to construct Hess-diagrams\nfor field stars, which alleviates the problems of constructing\nbackground samples when a GC is located near to the image\nedge. 3. A mean Hess-diagram was computed from these four\nHess-diagrams. 4. A cleaned Hess-diagram was calculated as\na difference between the contaminated Hess-diagram and the\nmean Hess-diagram for field stars. Positive data indicate the\nlocus of GC stars in the cleaned Hess-diagram. Solid lines\nrepresent the fundamental Zero Age Horizontal Branches\n(ZAHB) and isochrones taken from the Victoria-Regina stel-\n\nRGC\n(\u2032\u2032 )\n\nlar models of VandenBerg et al. (2006). Corresponding ages\nand metallicities are listed in Table 9.\n\n3.3\n\nComparison with Victoria-Regina Models\n\nTo fit theoretical isochrones to our stellar photometry data\nwe use the ages, [Z/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] obtained in our spectroscopic study. We note that [\u03b1/Fe] = 0 was adopted for\nall studied globular clusters according to our spectroscopic\nresults (see Section 2.3). Pipino et al. (2006) adopted a\nrelation [Fe/H] = [Z/H] \u2212 0.94 * [\u03b1/Fe] for Thomas et al.\n(2003) SSP models on the basis of a calibration on Galactic globular clusters. Since we found that GCs in NGC 147,\n185 and 205 have approximately solar [\u03b1/Fe], it means that\n[Fe/H] \u2248 [Z/H] in our case. We have no spectroscopic data\nfor Hubble VIII and FJJII. As a starting point for the\nspectroscopy-CMD comparison we adopt for these two clusters the age, metallicity, and [\u03b1/Fe] values obtained from the\naveraged spectra of Hubble I+VII and all GCs in NGC 185.\nTo show how the choice of different isochrones affects\nour results we plot isochrones and ZAHBs (VandenBerg et\nal., 2006) for different [Fe/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] (Fig. 7), and adopt\nthe age of 10 Gyr. The isochrones and ZAHBs for Age = 10\nGyr, [Fe/H] = \u22121.61 and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0 are drawn by grey lines.\nThe difference in (V \u2212 I) between isochrones that differ by 2\nGyr is of the order of a few hundredth of a magnitude. So, if\nwe know the metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe], the typical error of age\ndeterminations for the globular clusters studied photometrically is \u223c 2 Gyr given the accuracy of our photometry and\nthe scatter of the data for individual red-giant stars relative to fitted isochrones. However, since the accuracy of our\nspectroscopic metallicity and [\u03b1/Fe] determinations is low\nin some cases, the uncertainties of the transformations into\nthe standard VI system are \u223c0.m 05, and due to the effect\nof age-metallicity degeneracy on the color of the RGB (e.g.\nSaviane et al. 2000, Dolphin et al., 2003), we estimate the\nerror of our photometric age determinations to be <\n\u223c 4 Gyr.\nFor all GCs, except Hubble II in NGC 205, the ages,\nmetallicities, and [\u03b1/Fe] ratios derived by measuring the\nLick indices provide a good correspondence between the\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205\n\n13\n\nFigure 7. Demonstration of the influence of [\u03b1/Fe] and [Fe/H]\non the colour of RGB and the luminosity of ZAHB. We show\ntheoretical predictions of the Victoria-Regina stellar models of\nVandenBerg et al. (2006) for [Fe/H] = \u22121.6 dex, Age=10 Gyr,\nand [\u03b1/Fe] ratios 0.0, 0.3, 0.6 (left panel) and [Fe/H] = -2.14,\n-1.84, -1.61, -1.31, Age=10 Gyr, and [\u03b1/Fe] = 0 (right panel).\n\n3.4\n\nHorizontal-Branch Morphology\n\nBlue HB (BHB) and red HB stars (RHB) in our sample globular clusters were selected according to the boxes\nmarked in Fig. 5. The boundaries of the instability strip in\nthe V, I filter set were taken from Harbeck et al. (2001):\n(V \u2212 I)0 = 0.4 \u2212 0.75. We determine the HB morphology\nB\u2212R\n(Zinn et al. 1994) for each cluster. The resultindex B+V\n+R\ning HB morphology indices are listed in Table 9. Errors of\nthe HB morphology indices were determined by taking into\naccount variations of a number of blue and red HB stars in\nthe field regions. All globular clusters studied here appear\nto contain a significant population of BHB stars within their\nRGC radius.\nFigure 6. Illustration of our RGC finding technique. Top panel:\nWFPC2/PC image of FJJI (\u223c 34\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 34\u2032\u2032 , 750x750 pixels). The\nstars presented in the CMD in Fig. 5 are marked. Bottom panel:\nDistribution of blue stars with V \u2212I < 0.2 in a 200x800 pixel rectangular area centered on the cluster FJJI.

The\nHB stars in Hubble II seem too bright for their metallicity,\nwhereas the loci of RGB stars agree well with the spectroscopically derived metallicity. Our analysis indicates that in\norder to achieve good agreement between our spectroscopic\nand photometric results we have to reduce the distance\nmodulus to NGC 205, (m \u2212 M )0 = 24.58 (McConnachie,\n2005), by 0.2 mag. The resulting distance modulus is given\nin Table 1. The same distance modulus was applied to Hubble VIII in NGC 205.\nThere is a \u223c 2\u03c3 discrepancy between our spectroscopic\n([Z/H] = \u22121.24 \u00b1 0.17) and photometric (\u22121.6 \u00b1 0.2) metallicity estimates for FJJI. We adopt a mean value for this\ncluster [[Z/H] = \u22121.4 \u00b1 0.2 which coincides with a value\nobtained by Da Costa & Mould (1988).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe Second Parameter Effect\n\nThe morphology of the HB and the mean luminosity of the\nHB stars depend primarily on metallicity. Age is suspected\nto be the \"second parameter\" (Lee et al. 1994). In general,\nmetal-poor old globular clusters have blue HBs and metalrich 1\u20132 Gyr younger clusters have predominantly red HBs.\nHowever, it is known that more parameters may influence\nthe HB morphology such as helium abundance, CNO abundance etc. (Lee et al. 1994). We suggest that the photometric\ndata presented in our paper are accurate enough to consider\nthe influence of age and metallicity on the HB morphology\nand to compare this effect with the one studied in the literature for globular clusters in our Milky Way and other nearby\ngalaxies.\nFig. 8 shows the HB-type versus metallicity diagram\nfor our eight sample globular clusters studied photometrically. The overplotted isochrones were taken from Rey et\nal. (2001). It can be seen that the HB morphologies for\nsix of eight of our sample globular clusters follow the same\nbehavior as a function of metallicity as the 'young halo'\n\n\f14\n\nM. E. Sharina, V. L. Afanasiev, and T. H. Puzia\n\nFigure 9. Age-metallicity diagnostic plots for globular clusters in M31 from a sample of Puzia et al. 2005. We selected clusters with\ngalactocentric distances greater than \u223c40 kpc with the exception of clusters B006 and B012 located near the northern spur (McConnachie\net al., 2004) at the projected distances \u223c30 kpc and \u223c28 kpc from the center of M31, correspondingly.\n\nGalactic globular clusters. Mackey & Gilmore (2004) performed a comparison between 'old halo', 'young halo', and\n'bulge/disc' Galactic globular cluster sub-populations (Zinn,\n1993) using the HB-type versus metallicity diagram. The\nauthors showed that the majority of external GCs are indistinguishable from Galactic young halo GCs. Our analysis\nshows that six of our sample globular clusters follow a similar\ntrend, typical for 'young halo' Galactic GCs. We conclude\nthat, as the 'young halo' Galactic GCs, the HB morphologies for the majority of our sample globular clusters might\nbe, at least partly, influenced by age, in the sense that our\nsample GCs have redder HBs at a given metallicity.\nGlobular clusters in nearby dwarf galaxies Sagittarius\ndSph, Fornax dSph, Magellanic Clouds show similar secondparameter globular clusters which resemble the 'young halo'\nGalactic globular clusters in the HB-type versus [Fe/H] diagram (see e.g. Mackey & Gilmore 2004a,b; Buonanno et\nal. 1998, 1999; Strader et al. 2003). Rich et al. (2005) studied HB morphologies of 10 GCs in M31 using HST/WFPC2\nphotometry and found metal-poor globular clusters with HB\nmorphologies resembling those of the Fornax dSph galaxy\nglobular clusters. It is of interest to continue the CMD studies using high resolution HST imaging for GCs in dwarf\ngalaxies and the outskirts of nearby massive galaxies (e.g.\nM31) to establish the role of dwarf galaxies and their globular cluster systems as building blocks of massive galaxies\nin the Local group and other nearby groups within 10 Mpc.\nIf most younger halo GCs in massive galaxies were accreted\nfrom low-mass satellites, globular clusters in dwarf galaxies\nshould resemble these younger halo GCs in terms of HB type\nat a given metallicity. However, we do not know whether\nthese results could be appropriate for probing the formation\nof more distant galaxies situated in denser environments like\nVirgo or Fornax clusters.\n\n4.2\n\nComparison with Globular Clusters in M31\n\nPerrett et al. 2002, Beasley et al. 2004, Beasley et al. 2005,\nFusi Pecci et al. 2005, and Puzia et al. (2005a) studied GCs\nin the halo of M31 spectroscopically and found that the M31\nglobular clusters have essentially distinct properties from\nthose of the MW globular clusters. The main conclusions\nfrom these studies could be summarised as follows: 1. three\ntypes of GC populations exist in the halo of M31: old GCs\n(>10 Gyr) with a wide range of metallicities, intermediateage GCs with metallicity [Z/H] \u2248 \u22120.6, and young GCs\n(\u2264 1 Gyr) with slightly higher metallicities; 2. the M31\nGCs have lower [\u03b1/Fe] ratios than the MW GCs (a mean\n[\u03b1/Fe] = 0.14\u00b10.04 dex, Puzia et al., 2005a); 3. the detailed\nabundances of some elements (e.g. C, N) show a different behaviour with age and metallicity than that of Galactic GCs.\nWe select halo globular clusters located at projected\ngalactocentric distances larger than that of NGC 205 (\u223c 40\nkpc) from the samples of Worthey et al. (1994), Kuntschner\net al. (2002), Beasley et al. (2004) and Puzia et al. (2005a).\nFig. 9 shows [\u03b1/Fe] and age-metallicity diagnostic plots for\nthese globular clusters. We expect such clusters to be the\nmost likely candidates for accreted objects resembling ages\nand chemical compositions similar to globular clusters in\nNGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205. Indeed, ten of sixteen\nglobular clusters selected from the sample of Puzia et al.\n(2005a) are old and metal poor and are located at similar\nplaces in the age-metallicity diagnostic plots as our sample\nGCs in dwarf galaxies. Only three of them have [\u03b1/Fe] \u2264 0.0\naccording to the data of Puzia et al. (2005a): B304: ([Z/H] \u223c\n\u22121.3, age \u223c 13 Gyr, [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c \u22120.12), B310: ([Z/H] \u223c \u22121.6,\nage \u223c 12 Gyr, [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c \u22120.33), B358: ([Z/H] \u223c \u22122.0, age\n\u223c 10 Gyr, [\u03b1/Fe] \u223c 0.00). Some of the selected M31 globular\ncluster show high metallicities and old ages (see right panel\n\n\fGlobular clusters in NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205\n4.3\n\nFigure 8. HB-type versus metallicity diagram for our sample\nglobular clusters (open circles), old halo (dots), disk/bulge (triangles) and young halo Galactic globular clusters (light filled circles), Fornax dSph (stars) and Sagittarius dSph (open triangles)\nglobular cluster systems. The overplotted isochrones are from Rey\net al. (2001). The ages of the isochrones are 0.0, \u22121.1, and \u22122.2\nGyr from the top to the bottom.\n\nof Fig. 9). There are no GCs with such properties in our\nsample.\nOne noteworthy case is the M31 globular cluster B337,\nwhich is located at a projected distance DM 31 \u223c 65 kpc\nfrom the center of M31 near the northern stellar spur kinematically associated with NGC 205 (McConnachie et al.\n2004). The cluster has an intermediate age of \u223c 5 Gyr and\n[Fe/H] \u2248 \u22120.6 dex, and a solar [\u03b1/Fe] ratio (Puzia et al.,\n2005a) similar to that found for Hubble VI in NGC 205\nand FJJVII in NGC 185. There are also indication for\nintermediate-age field stellar populations in the halo of M31\n(e.g. Brown et al. 2003, 2006).\nGuhathakurta et al. (2006) discovered an extended halo\nof metal-poor RGB stars out to a projected distance of 165\nkpc from M31's center. Hence, NGC 147, NGC 185, and\nNGC 205 with their globular cluster systems are embedded\nin this halo and some clusters may have properties similar\nto the M31 halo GCs. Pritzl et al. (2005) demonstrated that\nmost Galactic globular cluster stars show similar [\u03b1/Fe] ratios as field stars of similar metallicities, and neither clearly\nresembles the stellar abundances in dwarf galaxies. The situation can be more complex for M31, where the processes\nof merging and tidal disruption are still active. Additional\nspectroscopic and CMD studies of GCs in M31 and dwarf\nsatellites are needed to establish the fraction of M31 halo\nGCs which are twins of the globular clusters in NGC 147,\nNGC 185, and NGC 205.\n\n15\n\nThe Diffuse Stellar Populations\n\nMany authors pointed out the large abundance spread across\nthe red giant branches of our sample galaxies. Mould et al.\n(1984) found a mean metallicity for NGC 205 [M/H] >\n\u223c \u2212\n0.9 \u00b1 0.2 and a metallicity dispersion \u03c3[M/H] >\n0.5\ndex.\nAd\u223c\nditionally, these authors obtained a large age spread of RGB\nstars in the range 2\u20138 Gyr. Mould et al. (1983) estimated a\nmean metallicity of RGB stars in the outer parts of NGC 147\n[M/H]= \u22121.2 \u00b1 0.2 and a metallicity spread of 0.3 dex. Lee\net al. (1993) obtained a metallicity dispersion in NGC 185\nin the range \u22121.6[Fe/H] < \u22120.9 dex from the dispersion of\nthe mean color of RGB stars measured at MI = 3.5. Grebel\n(2000) derived the following values of metallicity and the\nmetallicity spread for NGC 205, NGC 185, and NGC 147\ncorrespondingly: \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.5, \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.4 and \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.4.\nMean metallicities estimated by McConnachie et al. (2005)\nfor RGB stars in our sample galaxies are consistent with\nthe data from the aforementioned studies: [M/H]\u03b1=0.0 =\n\u22120.8 for NGC 205, [M/H]\u03b1=0.0 = \u22121.2 for NGC185, and\n[M/H]\u03b1=0.0 = \u22121.1 for NGC 147.\nHigh resolution HST images made it possible to study\nRGB stars closer to the centers of our sample galaxies. Butler and Martinez-Delgado (2005) identified ancient stars in\nNGC 185 with [Fe/H] <\n\u223c \u2212 1.5 dex with the mean metallicity\n\u22121.11 \u00b1 0.08 dex and the last period of active star formation\ndating about 4x108 yr ago. The most metal-rich RGB stars\nin NGC 205 were found to reach [Fe/H] >\n\u223c \u2212 0.7 dex, while\na median value of metallicity for ancient stars in this galaxy\nis [Fe/H] = \u22121.06 \u00b1 0.04. Dolphin (2005) using the same observational material and the DOLPHOT program obtained\nmean metallicities \u22120.6, \u22120.9, and \u22120.9 dex for NGC 205,\nNGC 185, and NGC 147, respectively.\nOur spectroscopic study deals with the integrated light\nfrom stars in NGC 205 and NGC 185 very near to the centres of the host galaxies. Hence, it is worth to note that\nour study supplements the results obtained by the extensive\nCMD studies. We found [Z/H] \u223c 0.5 dex for the central regions of NGC 205 and a large spread of metallicity \u223c 0.3\u00f70.4\ndex which could not be explained by measurement uncertainties, because the spread is considerably less for globular\nclusters having the same S/N ratio in their spectra. We estimate the metallicity of the region of diffuse galactic light in\nNGC185 near the globular cluster FJJIII (dproj = 0.2 kpc)\nto be [Z/H] = \u22121.16 \u00b1 0.25 in a good consent with the CMD\nstudies. As it was also mentioned by Da Costa & Mould\n(1988) the mean abundance of the associated globular clusters in each of the studied galaxies is considerably less than\nthat observed for the corresponding field halo stars. So, one\ncould suggest that globular cluster systems of these galaxies formed at the earliest epochs of galactic formation along\nwith the first stars.\nWe found indications for increasing age with increasing galactocentric distance for the field stellar population in\nNGC 205. The same trend was found in deep CMD studies\nfor stellar populations in NGC 205 and NGC 185. According to Cappellari et al. (1999) there is a central population of stars in NGC 205 with ages in the range 50 \u2013 100\nMyr. AGB stars have solar metallicity and are distributed\nuniformly over the inner \u223c 1\u2032 (Davidge 1992). Old stars\nin NGC 185 form the less concentrated system (MartinezDelgado et al. 1999). The youngest stars are located in the\n\n\f16\n\nM. E. Sharina, V. L. Afanasiev, and T. H. Puzia\n\ncentral 150x90 parsec2 region (Butler & Martinez-Delgado,\n2005). Outside this area only stars with ages \u2265 1 Gyr are\nfound.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAlthough the modest S/N of some of our GC spectra and\nthe relatively moderate photometric depth of our CMDs\ndo not allow us to derive very accurate ages, we conclude\nthat all our sample GCs appear to be old (T > 8 Gyr) and\nmetal-poor ([Z/H] <\n\u223c \u2212 1.1), except for the GCs Hubble V\nin NGC 205 (T = 1.2 \u00b1 0.6 Gyr, [Z/H] = \u22120.6 \u00b1 0.2), Hubble VI in NGC 205 (T = 4 \u00b1 2 Gyr, [Z/H] = \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2), and\nFJJVII in NGC 185 (T = 7 \u00b1 3 Gyr, [Z/H] = \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2).\nWe find two intermediate-age GCs (HubbleVI and FJJVII)\nwhich are located at projected distances Dproj \u223c 0.3 and\n1.0 kpc from the centers of their host galaxies. Deep images\ntaken with HST/ACS are necessary to understand whether\nthese relatively faint star clusters are genuine globular clusters (i.e. simple stellar populations) born during \u223c 4 \u2212 6 Gyr\nold star-formation events in their host galaxies. They could\nconsist also of multiple stellar populations similar to \u03c9Cen\n(see e.g. Sollima et al. 2005).\nThe HB morphologies for our sample GCs follow the\nsame behavior with metallicity as younger halo Galactic\nglobular clusters. It was found for Galactic GC, that age\nmay not be the dominant second parameter determining the\nshape of globular clusters' HBs (see e.g. Stetson et al., 1996).\nGCs having blue HBs are in general older than 10 Gyr (Lee\net al. 1994). So, we suggest here that the HB morphologies\nfor our sample GCs likely do not bias our spectroscopic age\nestimates based on Balmer absorption line indices.\nWe find that most of the GCs in the studied galaxies\nare weakly or not \u03b1-enhanced, in contrast to the population of GCs in nearby early-type galaxies (see Puzia et al.\n2006). The chemical composition of globular clusters may\nturn out to be a powerful tool to discriminate between clusters which formed in situ in massive galaxies and those that\nwere formed in smaller sub-units and later accreted in more\nmassive halos.\nSpectroscopic ages and metallicities of the central regions in NGC 205 and NGC 185 coincide with those obtained from color-magnitude diagrams. The central field\nstellar populations in these galaxies have approximately the\nsame age as their most central GCs Hubble V in NGC 205\nand FJJIII in NGC 185, respectively, but are more metalrich than the central globular clusters.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMES acknowledges all participants of the project SCORPIO at scientific advisory of V.L.
