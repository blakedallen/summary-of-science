Firstly the physics associated with deconfinement or chiral symmetry restoration is strongly coupled\nwhere we traditionally do not know how to compute. Secondly at finite density lattice gauge theory, the first principles simulation of the theory on supercomputers, suffers\na \"sign problem\" that means Monte Carlo methods break\ndown. In fact with light quarks there is no clear order parameter for deconfinement so we will concentrate on the\nchiral transition. Progress has been made by identifying\neffective theories of the transitions and through lattice\ncomputations at low density. [1] provides a review of\nthe standard picture. It is believed for QCD, with the\nphysical quark masses, that the phase transition with\ntemperature is a smooth cross over (becoming a second\norder transition as the up and down quark masses go to\nzero). At zero temperature the transition with density\nis believed to be first order. There must therefore be a\ncritical point where the first order line ends in the temperature density plane.\nIn the last ten years the AdS/CFT Correspondence [2\u2013\n4] and more general gauge/gravity dualities have emerged\nas a new tool for the study of strongly coupled problems.\nIt is interesting to ask whether these holographic models\ncan in principle describe a phase diagram like that of real\nQCD. One recent attempt in this direction can be found\nin [5] where a 5d holographic model of a strongly coupled\ngauge theory with a running coupling was shown to give\nan appropriate looking phase diagram. In that model\nthe order parameter is associated with confinement and\nit does not include quark fields. In true QCD the order\nparameter across the phase diagram is the quark bilinear\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nevans@soton.ac.uk\nag806@soton.ac.uk\nmm21g08@soton.ac.uk\nK.Y.Kim@uva.nl\n\ncondensate. In this paper we will study a holographic\nmodel of quark fields and again attempt to reproduce\nkey features of the QCD phase diagram.\nQuarks can be introduced into the AdS/CFT Correspondence through probe branes [6\u201310] and a number of\nsystems with chiral symmetry breaking have been developed [11\u201316]. We can not of course describe true QCD\nholographically because the dual, if it exists, is not known\nand is probably very complicated (and strongly coupled,\nat least, in the UV). Our analysis is therefore in the spirit\nof AdS/QCD [17, 18], a phenomenological modeling of\nthe QCD phase diagram. If one could model the phase\ndiagram correctly one might hope to then predict other\nfeatures of the theory such as time dependent dynamics\nduring transitions and so forth.\nOur models will be in the context of the simplest brane\nconstruction of a 3+1d gauge theory with quarks which is\nthe D3/D7 system of Fig 1 [6\u201310]. The basic gauge theory\nis large N , N = 4 super Yang-Mills with Nf quark fields.\nWe will work in the quenched approximation where we\nneglect quark loops. On the gauge theory side we do\nnot backreact the D7 branes, that provide the quarks, on\nthe geometry but instead work in the probe approximation [8]. The theory has a U (1) symmetry under which a\nfermionic quark anti-quark condensate has charge 2 and\nplays the role of U (1) axial [11]. Although the theory\ndoes not have a non-abelian chiral symmetry (as for example the Sakai Sugimoto model does [16]) this is not\nimportant in the quenched approximation since the dynamics of the formation of the quark condensate is flavour\nindependent. The model is very simple to work with having a background geometry that is just AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and\nthe gauge theory is 3+1d at all energy scales.\nSo called top down models of this type exist with chiral\nsymmetry breaking. Supergravity solutions exist that\ncorrespond to the AdS space being deformed in reaction\nto a running coupling introduced by a non-trivial dilaton\nprofile [11, 13]. In cases where the coupling grows in the\ninfra-red (IR), breaking the conformal symmetry, chiral\nsymmetry breaking is induced. These models have very\n\n\f2\nT\n0.30\n0.25\n\nc=0, d=0, J=0\n1st order\n\n2nd order\n\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n\n\u03a7SB\nzero density\nc10, d=0, J=0\nstable meson\n\n\u03a7SB\nfinite density\nc10, d10, J=0\n\n\u03a7S\nfinite density\nc=0, d10, J=0\n\n0.05\n\nFIG. 1:\nA schematic of the D3/D7 showing our conventions.

At the string theory\nlevel a full interpretation is lacking.\nA yet simpler and completely computable case with\nchiral symmetry breaking is provided by introducing a\nbackground magnetic field associated with U (1) baryon\nnumber [15]. Such a background source can be described\nby a gauge field on the surface of the D7 brane. A chiral\ncondensate is induced. Very simplistically one can think\nof the B-field as introducing a scale that breaks the conformal symmetry as the strong coupling scale \u039bQCD does\nin QCD allowing the strong dynamics to form the quark\ncondensate.\nIn recent papers [19\u201323] we have explored the phase\nstructure of the theory with magnetic field. Temperature can be introduced through an AdS Schwarzschild\nblack hole in the geometry [4]. Density and chemical potential can be added through the temporal component of\nthe U (1) baryon number gauge field [25\u201327]. The phase\ndiagram [19] is shown in Fig 2(a). The chiral restoration\ntransition was found to be first order with temperature\nand second order with density. A critical point lies between these regimes. In addition there is an extra transition associated with the formation of density and the\nmesons of the system melting into the background plasma\n[28, 29]. In places in phase space this merges with the\nchiral transition but in other places it separates and can\nbe either first or second order. Such a phase with a quark\ndensity but chiral symmetry breaking could potentially\nexist in QCD. It would be nice to also describe this transition as a deconfinement transition but firstly the N = 4\nbackground does not induce linear confinement and secondly the presence of any temperature leads to screening\nof the quarks at the length scale of the inverse temperature. The meson bound states are closer in spirit to\natomic bound states than QCD-like mesons. Nevertheless they are being disrupted by the background plasma\nso the existence of a phase with melted mesons but chiral\nsymmetry breaking at least leads one to speculate on a\npossible separation of deconfinement and chiral restoration behaviour in the QCD phase plane.\nIn the gravity picture of the transitions the crucial\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\nc=0, d=0, J=0\n1st order\n2nd order\n\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n\n\u03a7SB\ninsulator\nc10, d=0, J=0\nstable meson\n\n\u03a7SB\nconductor\nc10, d=0, J10\n\n\u03a7S\nconductor\nc=0, d=0, J10\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nE\n0.30\n\n0.25\n\n(b)T -E phase diagram.

An embedding that curves\nin the holographic space to miss the black hole represents the chiral symmetry breaking phase. These solutions have stable and discrete linearized fluctuations that\ncorrespond to the mesons of the theory. The second type\n\n\f3\nof embedding curves off axis but ends on the black hole.\nIt describes a phase with chiral symmetry breaking but\nthe linearized fluctuations are now replaced by in-falling\nquasi-normal modes of the black hole which describe unstable mesonic fluctuations of a quark plasma. Finally\nthe flat embedding ending on the black hole describes\nmelted mesons and chiral symmetry restoration. The\ntransitions occur when the magnitude of the D7 action\nfor these different cases cross.\nHow generic to the holographic description is this\nphase structure? Keeping within the top down analysis one can change parameters and see what effect they\nhave on the phase diagram. For example in [21] we traded\ndensity for an electric field parallel to the magnetic field.\nThe electric field tries to dissociate mesons by accelerating the quark and anti-quark in opposite directions and\nso opposes the formation of a chiral condensate. The\nphase diagram of the theory in the T -E plane at fixed B\nis also shown in Fig 2(b). The chiral transitions are again\nfirst order with temperature but second order with density although there is some change in the meson melting\ntransition order1 . We followed up this analysis in [22] to\nconsider the case of mutually perpendicular electric and\nmagnetic fields - there the chiral transition is first order\nin nature throughout the full T -E plane.\nA recent paper [31] performed a simliar analysis with\na running dilaton geometry. The geometry is that of [32]\nin which there is a non-zero profile for both the dilaton\nand axion fields in AdS. The field theory is the N = 4\ngauge theory with a vev for both TrF 2 and TrF F\u0303 which\npreserves supersymmetry at zero temperature but displays confinement. A D7 was introduced in a supersymmetry breaking fashion and chiral symmetry breaking is\nobserved. The temperature density chiral transformation\nwas first order throughout the plane and is shown in Fig\n3. It shows the same three phases as the magnetic field\ncase. An extra component of the analysis in [31] was to\nnote that in the confining geometry with a running dilaton a baryonic phase was also present. A baryon vertex\nis described by a D5 brane wrapped on the S 5 of the\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 space. In the pure N = 4 theory such vertices\nshrink to zero. However in the running dilaton geometry\nthe large IR value of the dilaton stabilizes the D5 embedding. Solutions exist that link the D5 to the D7 brane\nembedding with a balancing force condition. These configurations describe the gauge theory with finite baryon\ndensity rather than finite quark density. This phase sets\nin at finite chemical potential and then persists to infinite\nchemical potential (as shown in Fig 3) which is certainly\nunlike QCD. We will not focus on this phase in this paper\nbut it would be interesting to study it in future work to\nfind models that have a baryonic phase in some intermediate range of chemical potential like QCD.\n\nThese phase structures are very interesting and surprisingly complex but do not match the expectations in\nQCD. In QCD we need a second order transition with\ntemperature and a first order transition with density to\nthe chirally symmetric phase.\nHere we want to work in a much more generic framework to ask what phase structures it is possible to get\nin the holographic description and to try to force ourselves onto a representation of the QCD phase diagram.\nWe will therefore take a bottom up approach within the\nmodel and allow ourselves to dial the running of the\ngauge coupling by hand. We will have a dilaton profile\nthat smoothly transitions from a UV conformal regime\nto an IR conformal regime through a step of variable\nheight and width. Such an ansatz allows one to consider\nrunnings that range from precocious growth in the IR\nto more walking like dynamics[33]. We used a similar\nansatz in previous papers to study the impact of walking\n[14] on meson physics and as a mechanism for generating\ninflation [34]. Here, in a completely new analysis of the\nphase structure of these models, we find that with the\nsimple step ansatz we can move from a totally first order\ntransition in the phase plane to a configuration similar to\nthat we obtained with a B field (a first order transition\nwith temperature but second order with density). With\nthis ansatz we can not achieve a second order transition\nwith temperature.\nThe model directly suggests other phenomenological\ngeneralizations though. In particular, if we think of the\nrunning dilaton profile as a short cut for including the\nback reaction due to the quark fields/D7 brane 2 , then\nit is natural to break the SO(6) symmetry of AdS5 in\nthe dilaton in the same fashion as the D3/D7 system's\ngeometry. This allows us an extra phenomenological freedom to distort the dilaton or black hole horizon. These\nsimple changes do allow us to reproduce a wide range of\nphase diagrams including QCD-like ones as we will show\nbelow. We will discuss the simple geometric reasons for\nthe emergence of first or second order transitions in these\ndifferent scenarios.\nOur conclusion therefore is that the holographic model\nhas no intrinsic problem with mimicking the QCD phase\ndiagram and these systems may therefore be phenomenologically useful in the future.\n\nII.\n\nFirst let us review the gravity dual description of the\nsymmetry breaking behaviour of our strongly coupled\ngauge theory.\n\n2\n\n1\n\nThere may be an instability in Fig 2 due to the WZ term contribution [22, 30].\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nIn [35], D3-D7 solutions at finite temperature and chemical potential, with the inclusion of dynamical flavor effects, have been\nderived and studied as full-fledged top-down models. They will\nbe the first step towards the top-down study of phase transitions\nin D3-D7 systems with dynamical flavors.\n\n\f4\nDp-branes are p dimensional membrane like objects\nto which the ends of open strings are tied. The weak\ncoupling picture for our D3/D7 set up is shown in Fig\n1 [6\u201310] - there are N D3 branes and the lightest string\nstates with both ends on the D3 generate the adjoint\nrepresentation fields of the N = 4 gauge theory. Strings\nstretched between the D3 and the D7 are the quark fields\nlying in the fundamental representation of the SU (N )\ngroup (they have just one end on the D3).\nIn the strong coupling limit the D3 branes in this picture are replaced by the geometry that they induce. We\nwill consider a gauge theory with a holographic dual described by the Einstein frame geometry AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nds2 =\n\n\u0001\nr 2 2 R2\ndx4 + 2 d\u033a2 + \u033a2 d\u03a923 + dw52 + dw62 , (1)\n2\nR\nr\n\nwhere we have split the coordinates into the x3+1 of the\ngauge theory, the \u033a and \u03a93 which will be on the D7 brane\nworld-volume and two directions transverse to the D7,\nw5 , w6 . The radial coordinate, r2 = \u033a2 + w52 + w62 , corresponds to the energy scale of the gauge theory.\nThe\n\u2032\nradius of curvature is given by R4 = 4\u03c0gs N \u03b1 2 with N\nthe number of colours. The r \u2192 \u221e limit of this theory is dual to the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory where\n2\ngs = gUV\nis the constant large r asymptotic value of the\ngauge coupling.\nIn addition we will allow ourselves to choose the profile\nof the dilaton as r \u2192 0 to represent the running of the\ngauge theory coupling, e\u03c6 \u2261 \u03b2, where the function \u03b2 \u2192 1\nas r \u2192 \u221e. An interesting phenomenological case is to\nconsider a gauge coupling running with a step of the form\n[14, 34]\n\u03b2(r) = A + 1 \u2212 A tanh [\u0393(r \u2212 \u03bb)] .\n\n(2)\n\nOf course in this case the geometry is not back reacted\nto the dilaton and the model is a phenomenological one\nin the spirit of AdS/QCD[17, 18]. This form introduces\nconformal symmetry breaking at the scale \u039b = \u03bb/2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nwhich triggers chiral symmetry breaking. The parameter\nA determines the increase in the coupling across the step.\nWe will introduce a single D7 brane probe [8] into the\ngeometry to include quarks - by treating the D7 as a\nprobe we are working in a quenched approximation although we can reintroduce some aspects of quark loops\nthrough the running coupling's form if we wish (or know\nhow). This system has a U (1) axial symmetry on the\nquarks, corresponding to rotations in the w5 -w6 plane,\nwhich will be broken by the formation of a quark condensate.\nIn the true vacuum at T = 0 the brane will be\nstatic. We must find the D7 embedding function e.g.\nw5 (\u033a), w6 = 0. The Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) action in\nEinstein frame is given by\nZ\np\nSD7 = \u2212T7 d8 \u03bee\u03c6 \u2212 det P [G]ab\nZ\n(3)\nq\n4\n3\n2\n= \u2212T 7 d x d\u033a \u033a \u03b2 1 + (\u2202\u033a w5 ) ,\n\n\u22122\nwhere T7 = (2\u03c0)\u22127 \u03b1\u2032\u22124 gUV\nand T 7 = 2\u03c0 2 T7 when we\nhave integrated over the 3-sphere on the D7. The equation of motion for the embedding function is therefore\n#\n\"\nq\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u03b2\u033a3 \u2202\u033a w5\n\u22122w5 \u033a3 1 + (\u2202\u033a w5 )2 2 = 0 . (4)\n\u2202\u03c1 p\n2\n\u2202r\n1 + (\u2202\u033a w5 )\n\nThe UV asymptotic of this equation, provided the dilaton\nreturns to a constant so the UV dual is the N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory, has solutions of the form\nw5 = m +\n\nc\n+ *** ,\n\u033a2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we can interpret m as the quark mass (mq =\nm/2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 ) and c is proportional to the quark condensate.\nThe embedding equation (4) clearly has regular solutions w5 = m when gY2 M is independent of r - the flat\nembeddings of the N = 2 Karch-Katz theory [8]. Equally\nclearly if \u2202\u03b2/\u2202r2 is none trivial in w5 then the second\nterm in (4) will not vanish for a flat embedding.\nThere is always a solution w5 = 0 which corresponds\nto a massless quark with zero quark condensate (c = 0).\nIn the pure N = 2 gauge theory with \u03b2 = 1 this is the\ntrue vacuum. In the symmetry breaking geometries this\nconfiguration is a local maximum of the potential.\nIf the coupling is larger near the origin then the D7\nbrane will be repelled from the origin 3 . The parameter\n\u0393 spreads the increase in the coupling over a region in r\nof order \u0393\u22121 in size.\nWe display the embeddings for some particular cases\nin Fig 4. Note that we have chosen parameters here that\nmake the vacuum energy of the theory the same in each\ncase. The vacuum energy is given by minus the DBI\naction evaluated on the solution. In fact this energy is\nformally divergent corresponding to the usual cosmological constant problem in field theory. As usual we will\nsubtract the UV component of the energy to renormalize.\nThe symmetry breaking of these solutions is visible\ndirectly [11]. The U (1) symmetry corresponds to rotations of the solution in the w5 -w6 plane. An embedding\nalong the \u033a axis corresponds to a massless quark with\nthe symmetry unbroken (this is the configuration that is\npreferred at high temperature and it has zero condensate\nc). The symmetry breaking configurations though map\nonto the flat case at large \u033a (the UV of the theory) but\nbend off axis breaking the symmetry in the IR.\nOne can interpret the D7 embedding function as the\ndynamical self energy of the quark, similar to that emerging from a gap equation [14]. The separation of the D7\n\n3\n\nIn fact there is a competition between the increased action from\nthe D7 entering the region with larger dilaton and the derivative\ncost of the D7 bending to avoid it. This leads to a critical value of\nA to trigger chiral symmetry breaking. For example for \u03bb = 1.7\nand \u0393 = 1 Ac = 2.1.

We will work\nthroughout in the massless quark limit. We can think\nof the scale \u03bb in the dilaton ansatz as our intrinsic scale\nof the theory and so we will leave that fixed. Then for\neach choice of parameters in the dilaton profile (A, \u0393) we\nanalyze the theory on a grid in T and \u03bc space.\nFor each point on the T, \u03bc grid we seek three sorts of\nembedding. The flat embedding L = 0 exists in all cases\nand describes the theory with m = 0 and c = 0. We use\n(18) to compute the d-\u03bc relation for these embeddings.\nWe can also seek curved embeddings that miss the\nblack hole. These solutions must have d = 0 but are\nconsistent for any value of \u03bc. Here we use the equation\nof motion for L from (16) and numerically shoot from\nan initial condition at \u03c1 = 0 with vanishing \u03c1 derivative,\nL\u2032 (0) = 0. We seek solutions that approach L = 0 at\nlarge \u03c1. These configurations have a non-zero condensate parameter c.\nFinally we can look for solutions that end on the black\nhole horizon. To find these we fix the density d and shoot\nout from all points along the horizon seeking a solution\nthat approaches L = 0 at large \u03c1. We then use (18) to\ncompute \u03bc from the solution. In this way we can fill out\nthe T ,\u03bc grid. The condensate can again be extracted\nfrom the large \u03c1 asymptotics of the embedding.\nAfter finding as many such solutions as exist at each\npoint the easiest method to identify the transition points\nis to plot the density against \u03bc on fixed T lines. The transitions and their order are then manifest. We display four\nsample plots in Fig 5 taken from scenarios below showing the four cases of the chiral transition and the meson\nmelting transition being respectively first or second order\nin all combinations.\n\nA.\n\nDependence on the change in coupling\n\nLet us first consider how the phase diagram depends\non the height of the step in the gauge coupling function\n\u03b2.

A\nconformal theory can not break a symmetry since it offers no scale for that symmetry breaking to occur at. In\nfact some finite departure from conformality is needed\nto break the chiral symmetry. For these choices of \u03bb, \u0393\nthe critical A is Ac = 2.1. We work above this value\nthroughout.\nAt low A there is a single transition for chiral symmetry\nrestoration and meson melting which is first order for all\nT and \u03bc. On the gravity side this is a transition between\nthe curved embedding that misses the black hole and the\nflat embedding. In this case an embedding ending on the\nblack hole never plays a role.\nFor larger A, a new phase with chiral symmetry breaking but melted mesons develops. There is a regime now\nin which the curved embedding ending on the black hole\nis energetically favoured. The transition from the chiral\nsymmetry breaking phase to this new phase is second order. The chiral symmetry restoration phase remains first\norder.\nAt very large A the chiral restoration transition becomes second order at high density.

As temperature is introduced through a small\nhorizon the interior of the space is \"eaten\" but the D7\nembedding remains oblivious to this change since it never\nreaches down to small r. As temperature rises the point\nof transition is when the horizon moves through the scale\n\u03bb where the dilaton step is. Once the region with a large\ndilaton is eaten by the black hole the preferred D7 embedding is the flat one.\nIn Fig 7 we show an extreme case of this behaviour\nexplicitly. Here we have taken \u0393 very large so that the\ntransition in the dilaton between the low and high value\nis very sharp. We plot the \u03b2 profile against our radial\nparameter w and mark in red the position of the black\nhole horizon.

The red line\nshows the position of the horizon. The final plot corresponds\nto the point of the first order transition.\n\nresembles that of the theory with chiral symmetry breaking induced by a magnetic field [15].

First of all the zero\ndensity transition with temperature is first order for a\nsimple reason. The D7 embedding breaks chiral symmetry at zero temperature because it prefers to avoid the\n\nwhere the argument of tanh in (12) vanishes. So, as T increases \u03bb\u2217 decreases. When T becomes Tc = \u221a\u03bb2 , \u03bb\u2217 = Tc\nthe dilaton is perfectly screened by the black hole horizon. (i.e. If T = 0, \u03bb\u2217 = \u03bb. If T = \u221a\u03bb2 , \u03bb\u2217 = \u221a\u03bb2 ). The\npoint of the first order transition is where the horizon\nscreens the dilaton.\nWhen density is introduced the story can become more\ncomplex. The action is (16) where it can be seen from the\nfirst of the two terms in the square root that including\nd increases the action. This increase can be beneficial\nthough if the second term with \u03b2 can be reduced. It is\npossible to reduce the \u03b2 term if the D7 enters the region\nwhere \u03b2 is large at small \u03c1. This means that the situation\ncan arise where curving off the axis and then spiking on to\nthe axis can be the lowest action state. This is typically\nmore likely where \u03b2 is largest in the interior space and\nthe most savings can be made entering that region at low\n\u03c1. As we have seen at large values of A embeddings that\nspike onto the horizon do play a role introducing an extra\nphase.\nIt is only possible to have second order transitions if\nall three phases we have described are present. In the D7\ndescription the D7 must move from a curved embedding\nthat avoids the black hole to a configuration that spikes\nonto the black hole to a flat embedding smoothly.\n\nB.\n\nDependence on the speed of running\n\nThe parameter \u0393 controls the period in \u03c1 or RG scale\nover which the change in the coupling A occurs. It allows\nus to naively go from a precociously running theory to a\nwalking theory (although the change in the parameter A\nover that period may enter into what is meant by walking\nversus running too).\n\n\f9\nT\n\nT\n\n0.8\n8\n0.6\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n\u039c\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n\u039c\n\n(a)\u03b1 = 1, A = 3, \u0393 = 1, \u03bb = 1.715\n\n(a)\u0393 = 0.1\n\nT\n\nT\n\n0.8\n2.5\n0.6\n\n2.0\n1.5\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n0.2\n0.5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u039c\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n\u039c\n\n(b)\u03b1 = 2.2, A = 3, \u0393 = 1, \u03bb = 1.715\n\n(b)\u0393 = 0.5\n\nT\n\nT\n2.0\n\n0.8\n1.5\n0.6\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u039c\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n\u039c\n\n(c)\u0393 = 1\n\n(c)\u03b1 = 3, A = 3, \u0393 = 1, \u03bb = 1.715\n\nFIG. 8: Example plots of three possible phase structures for\nA = 30, \u03bb = 1.715 and varying \u0393.

We start at \u0393 = 1 with a configuration already discussed that has all three phases present\nand second order transitions at high density. As \u0393 is reduced so that the step function in the dilaton becomes\nbroader the first order nature of the transitions reasserts\nitself. By \u0393 = 0.1 the mixed phase with chiral symmetry\nbreaking but melted mesons is no longer preferred at any\ntemperature or chemical potential value - there is a single\nfirst order transition.\nIn conclusion then moving towards a walking theory by\neither increasing the width of the running or decreasing\nthe magnitude of the increase in the coupling both move\nus towards a first order chiral transition. Stronger or\nquicker running favours a second order transition at low\ntemperature, high density.\n\nIV.\n\nwith temperature at zero density which is a key part of\nthe QCD picture.\nWe have a further natural freedom within our holographic model to exploit though. Our running dilaton is\nin someway supposed to represent the backreaction of the\nquark fields on the strongly interacting gauge dynamics\nto allow us to model theories with more interesting dynamics than the conformal N = 4 gauge fields. We introduce quarks through D7 branes that break the SO(6)\nsymmetry of the five sphere of the original AdS/CFT\nCorrespondence down to SO(4) \u00d7 SO(2). Our metric\nand ansatz for the running coupling (2) though respected\nthe full SO(6) symmetry. It seems reasonable to make\nuse of the broken symmetry to introduce a further free\nparameter into our model.\nThe most succesful scenario we have found is to introduce our explicit L \u2212 \u03c1 symmetry breaking parameter, \u03b1\nthrough the blackening factors of the metric\ngt =\n\nBREAKING THE \u03c1-L SYMMETRY\n\nOur goal is to attempt to reproduce a phase diagram\ncomparable to that of QCD in our holographic model.

We\nstart from a model with a first order transition throughout the phase plane. As we increase \u03b1 a region with\nmelted mesons but chiral symmetry breaking develops,\nassociated with second order transitions. It then spreads\nto the zero chemical potential axis\nThe reason for the onset of second order transitions\nwith just temperature is simply understood. We have\ndeformed the black hole horizon into an ellipse whose\nmajor axis is along the L axis. The area of enlarged\ndilaton remains circular in the \u03c1-L plane. Thus there are\ntemperature periods in which the area of the \u03c1-L plane\nwith a large dilaton is covered except for a small piece\nthat emerges from the horizon near the \u03c1 axis. If the\nvalue of the dilaton is sufficiently large in that uncovered\narea to encourage the D7 to avoid it, but the horizon on\nthe L axis has met the zero temperature D7 embedding,\nthen a second order transition to a black hole embedding\nis likely. Since in the absence of the rise in the dilaton the\nflat embedding would now be preferred the D7 settles on\nthe horizon so it just misses the raised dilaton area. As\nthe black hole grows further the embedding is likely to\ntrack down onto the axis smoothly as the raised dilaton\narea is finally eaten. This intuition is indeed matched by\nthe solutions as shown in Fig 9.\nThe bottom phase diagram in Fig 9 achieves our goal\nof reproducing a chiral transition that is second order\nwith temperature but first order with density.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we have converted the D3 probe-D7 system, that holographically describes N = 4 super YangMills theory with quenched N = 2 quark multiplets, to a\nphenomenological description of strongly coupled quark\nmatter. We introduced a simple unback-reacted profile\nfor the dilaton that describes a step of variable height\nand width in the running coupling of the gauge theory (2). This breaks the conformal symmetry of the model\nand introduces chiral symmetry breaking. We have then\nstudied the temperature and chemical potential phase\nstructure of the model.\nThe phase diagrams consist of three phases - a chirally symmetric phase at large temperature and density;\na chirally broken phase with non-zero quark density at\nintermediate values of T and \u03bc; and a chiral symmetry\n\n[1] K.

Fig\n2(a) shows these phase and their holographic analogue in\na previously studied case where chiral symmetry was broken by an applied magnetic field. Here we showed that a\nsmall wide step in the gauge coupling's running gives rise\nto a single first order transition between the chiral symmetric and the broken phase (see Fig 6). If the step is\nmade larger in height or thinner then the chirally broken\nphase with non-zero density also plays a role. Here the\ntransitions at low temperature with chemical potential\ncan be second order. These results match known results\nin top down models in the presence of magnetic fields to\ninduce the symmetry breaking.\nWe were interested in reproducing phase diagrams with\nthe structure believed to exist in QCD. To do this we\nmade use of the broken SO(6) symmetry of the gravity\ndual in the presence of D7 branes. Were the branes backreacted the dilaton and geometry would reflect this symmetry breaking. We introduced a further phenomenological parameters \u03b1 in the black hole blackening factor. This\nmodels allowed us to control which volumes of the holographic space have a large dilaton value within, which the\nD7 branes prefer to avoid. Using this one extra parameter we were able to generate phase diagrams like those in\nQCD with a chiral restoration transition that was second\norder with temperature but first order with density (see\nFig 9).\nThe ease with which such a variety of phase structures could be obtained is very encouraging for the idea\nof phenomenologically modeling the QCD phase diagram\nholographically. Further the phenomenological parameters we introduced are very natural in this context and\nit seems likely that top down models with such phase\nstructures should be possible as a result.\nAcknowledgments\n\nNE is grateful for the support of an STFC rolling\ngrant.
