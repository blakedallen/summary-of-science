ChaMPlane\nincorporates X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of fields in the Galactic\nPlane imaged with Chandra in the past six years. We present the results of a\npopulation study of the brightest X-ray sources in ChaMPlane. We use X-ray\nspectral fitting, X-ray lightcurve analysis, and optical photometry of candidate\ncounterparts to determine the properties of 21 sources. Our sample includes a\npreviously unreported quiescent low-mass X-ray binary or cataclysmic variable\n(R = 20.9) and ten stellar sources (12.5 <\n\u223c R <\n\u223c 15), including one flare star\n(R = 17.3). We find that quantile analysis, a new technique developed for constraining the X-ray spectral properties of low-count sources, is largely consistent\nwith spectral fitting.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccretion powered binaries with compact objects include white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and neutron stars/black holes in quiescent low-mass\nX-ray binaries (qLMXBs). Space densities of CVs and qLMXBs are poorly constrained physical quantities due to small number statistics and systematic selection effects (Warner 1995). The Chandra Multiwavelength Plane (ChaMPlane)\n33\nSurvey aims to constrain the Galactic population of low-luminosity (LX <\n\u223c 10\n\u22121\nerg s ) accretion-powered X-ray binaries using serendipitous sources detected\nin six years of deep (>\n\u223c 20 ks) Chandra observations. The current database includes \u223c15000 X-ray sources from 122 fields. ChaMPlane will use Chandra's\nsensitivity to detect CVs and qLMXBs beyond \u223c 1.2 kpc, the approximate limit\nof previous surveys; this future sample will allow us to study the spatial and\nluminosity distributions of CVs and qLMXBs on Galactic scales.\nChaMPlane utilizes deep optical imaging (to R = 24) to identify candidate\nsource counterparts for follow-up studies. Each of the 122 Chandra fields is\nimaged in VRI and H\u03b1 with the Mosaic cameras on the KPNO- and CTIO4m telescopes. Ongoing efforts for complete source classification include optical\nspectroscopy and infrared imaging of heavily reddened Galactic Bulge regions.\nA second major goal of ChaMPlane is to study populations of stellar coronal\nsources. By combining observations of coronal sources with spectral identifica1\n\n\f2\n\nPenner et al.\n\ntions from ChaMPlane's optical survey, we will be able to constrain when stars\ndevelop coronae.\nIn this study, we determine the properties of the brightest serendipitous\nsources using X-ray spectral fitting, X-ray lightcurve analysis, and optical photometry of candidate counterparts (\u00a72.). We also test the predictions of quantile\nanalysis for the first time (\u00a73.).\n2.\n\nThe bright sample\n\nGrindlay et al. (2005) details the selection criteria for the entire ChaMPlane\nSurvey. For this study, we apply further criteria, including a requirement that\nthe number of net source counts in the broad (BX , .3 \u2013 8 keV) band >\n\u223c 250, to\nconfidently model and fit X-ray spectra. We exclude the inner Bulge (l > 358\u25e6\nand l < 2\u25e6 ) to study a less crowded environment.\nOur bright sample is composed of 21 serendipitous X-ray sources. Ten have\ncandidate optical counterparts with R <\n\u223c 24; five of these have optical spectra in\nour current spectral database. Optical counterpart matching is in progress for\nthree remaining sources.\n2.1.\n\nThe CV/qLMXB candidate\n\nOne X-ray source is well fit (reduced \u03c72 = .94) by the absorbed powerlaw model,\n+.12\n22 cm\u22122 . The unabsorbed flux in B\nwith \u0393 = 1.01+.14\nX\n\u2212.13 and NH = .22\u2212.11 \u00d7 10\n\u221213\n\u22122\n\u22121\nis 5.1 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 10\nerg cm s . Assuming the Galactic dust distribution of\nDrimmel & Spergel (2001), the NH implies a distance of 1.3 kpc. The unabsorbed luminosity in BX is thus 1032 erg s\u22121 , consistent with luminosities of\nboth qLMXBs and CVs. The X-ray lightcurve (Fig. 1) appears periodic; it deviates from a constant count rate to 1% significance. Furthermore, the candidate\noptical counterpart of this source has a large H\u03b1 excess (H\u03b1 \u2212 R = \u2212.48 \u00b1 .13)\nand is bluer than many objects in the surrounding field. The ratio of unabsorbed X-ray flux to unabsorbed R flux (i.e., unabsorbed FX /FR ) is 28.3; for\ncomparison, most stellar coronal sources have unabsorbed FX /FR \u223c 10\u22123 . This\nsource is most likely a CV or qLMXB. Further work will help determine the\nprecise nature of the compact object.\n2.2.\n\nThe remaining sample\n\nCombining X-ray spectral fits with candidate optical counterpart photometry\nand spectroscopy in the same way as in \u00a72.1., we characterize the remainder\nof our sample. Our preliminary results indicate the sample consists of the\nCV/qLMXB candidate; ten stellar sources, one of which shows an X-ray flare\nduring the Chandra observation; three probable active galactic nuclei (AGN);\none candidate young stellar object (YSO); and six unclassified sources. These\nsix include four sources with optical counterparts too faint for ChaMPlane; if we\nassume a limiting absorbed R \u2243 24, two of these four sources have unabsorbed\nFX /FR > 1, values too high for the sources to be stellar coronae. Unabsorbed\nFX /FR for the sample is shown in Fig. 2; the ratios range from \u223c 10\u22123 for\nstellar coronal sources to \u2243 30 for the CV/qLMXB candidate.\n\n\fSerendipitous X-ray Sources in ChaMPlane\n\n3\n\nNet count rate (cts/ksec)\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nTime (ksec)\n\n20\n\n25\n\n-12.0\n\n2\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nlog(\n0\n\n-1\n\n-14.0\n25\n\nFla\n\nFX /F\n\nR\n\nre s\n\n)=\n\n-13.0\n\n-13.5\n\ntar\n\n-12.5\n\n1\n\nlog(unabsorbed FX) in .3 - 8 keV\n\nFigure 1.

Sources for which the optical counterpart is too faint\nare shown with upper limits to the unabsorbed R magnitude.\n\n3.\n\nQuantile analysis\n\nMost X-ray sources in ChaMPlane's catalog do not have enough counts for\nconfident spectral fitting. Quantile analysis, detailed in Hong et al. (2004), is\na method of constraining the absorption and spectral parameters of low-count\nsources (see Fig. 3). We perform quantile analysis for the 21 bright sources\nusing both powerlaw and thermal bremsstrahlung models. For the first time, we\ntest the predictions of quantile analysis against spectral parameters from fitting.\nWe find that, of the 13 sources where the X-ray spectrum is best fit by either a\n\n\f4\n\nPenner et al.\n\npowerlaw or thermal bremsstrahlung model, only 2 have quantile values outside\nthe 1\u03c3 results from spectral fitting.
