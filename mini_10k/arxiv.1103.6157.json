The mechanism of gap opening in GNRs depends\non the nature of the edge termination. First principles calculations8,9 show that, in case of mono-layer zigzag GNRs\n(ZGNRs) energy gaps open up due to edge magnetism. On the other hand, the gap opening in mono-layer armchair\nGNRs (AGNRs), is believed to be both due to quantum confinement, and the reduction of the bond lengths at the\nedges.8\nWhile numerous theoretical studies of the electronic structure and related properties of the mono-layer GNRs\nexist,10 relatively fewer calculations on bilayer and multilayer-GNRs have been performed.11\u201320 Recently, gated bilayer\ngraphene has attracted a great deal of attention in the experimental,21\u201325 as well as theoretical communities.26\u201330 The\nenergy gap in bilayer graphene, in the presence of a transverse electric field, has been found to be tunable over a wide\nrange of values (up to 250 meV).21,23 Furthermore, the electrical noise levels in bilayer graphene channels is much less\ncompared to the noise levels in single layer graphene,22 thus making bilayer graphene, a promising candidate for the\nfabrication of high-quality electronic devices. Based upon this, one can argue that compared to mono-layer GNRs,\nbilayer GNRs will possess superior properties from the point of view of device physics. Moreover, it is interesting to\nstudy multilayer graphene and GNRs in their own right, as they can help us in understanding the evolution of the\nelectronic structure from graphene to bulk graphite.31\nRecently, we have developed an approach to study the electronic structure of graphene nanostructures, based\nupon the \u03c0-electron Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model Hamiltonian,32 and used it to study the band structure, edge\nmagnetism, and optical absorption of mono -layer GNRs of various types, at the Hartree-Fock level.33 The advantage\nof the PPP model based methodology is that it incorporates the long-range Coulomb interactions among the \u03c0electrons in a natural way. In this work, we apply our approach33 to perform a detailed investigation of the electronic\nstructure of multilayer AGNRs, with and without an external electric field, and for various edge alignments. For\nthe gated ribbons with the intrinsic band gaps above a critical value (say, \u01ebc ), the gap decreases with the increasing\nfield strength, while for those with gaps lower than \u01ebc , it increases with the external field, a result in good agreement\nwith the recent ab initio results of Sahu et al.20 In addition to the studies of the band structure, we also present\ncalculations of the optical absorption spectra of various multilayer AGNRs for different edge alignments, for various\npolarization directions of the incident light, and with, and without, a gate bias. To the best of our knowledge, no prior\ncalculations of optical absorption in multilayer-GNRs exist, which take electron-electron interactions into account.\nOur calculations reveal that for the gated bilayer ribbons, for large bias fields, the optical absorption intensity increases\nfor the ribbons with the intrinsic band gaps higher than \u01ebc , while for the ribbons with the gaps smaller than \u01ebc , the\n\n\fabsorption intensity decreases. However, for smaller bias fields, the absorption intensity exhibits a more complicated\nbehavior with respect to the field strength, a behavior in sharp contrast with the gated bilayer graphene which exhibits\nonly increase in the absorption intensity with the increasing bias field.21,23,30 Furthermore, we find that in addition\nto the polarization direction, the absorption intensity is found to be crucially dependent on the number of layers in\nthe multilayer AGNRs, and their edge alignment, thereby allowing for optical determination of their structure.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we briefly describe our PPP model based\ntheoretical methodology. Next, in Sec. III we present the results of our calculations on the band structure of various\nmultilayer AGNRs, and discuss the variation of the band gap with the increasing number of layers, their widths, and\nas a function of the gate bias. In section IV we present the optical absorption spectra of these systems, and discuss\ntheir variation with n, external electric field, and the type of edge alignment. Finally, in Sec V we summarize our\nresults, and present the conclusions.\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL METHODOLOGY\n\nIn our earlier works we have used the PPP model to extensively to study the electronic structure and optical\nproperties of finite \u03c0-electron systems such as conjugated molecules and oligomers at various levels of theory,34 while\nin our recent work we extended it to study GNRs in the infinite length limit, with 1D periodic boundary conditions\nimposed.33 The PPP model Hamiltonian,32 with one \u03c0-electron per carbon atom, is given by\nX\ntij (c\u2020i\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + c\u2020j\u03c3 ci\u03c3 ) +\nH=\u2212\nU\n\nX\n\ni,j,\u03c3\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 +\n\ni\n\nX\ni<j\n\nVij (ni \u2212 1)(nj \u2212 1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c\u2020i\u03c3 creates an electron\nof spin \u03c3 on the pz orbital of carbon atom i, ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 is the number of electrons with\nP\nthe spin \u03c3, and ni = \u03c3 ni\u03c3 is the total number of electrons on atom i. The parameters U and Vij are the on-site\nand long-range Coulomb interactions, respectively, while tij is the one-electron hopping matrix element. On setting\nU = Vij = 0, the Hamiltonian reduces to tight binding (TB) model, while on setting just Vij = 0, it reduces to the\nHubbard model. The parametrization of Coulomb interactions is Ohno like,35\nVi,j =\n\nU\n,\n2 )1/2\n\u03bai,j (1 + 0.6117Ri,j\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, \u03bai,j depicts the dielectric constant of the system which can simulate the effects of screening, and Ri,j is the\ndistance in \u00c5 between the i-th and the j-th carbon atoms. In our earlier work on GNRs,33 we used the ab-initio\nGW band structure of mono layer AGNR-12 (AGNR-NA , denotes an AGNR with NA dimer lines across the width)\nreported by Son et al.8 to obtain a set of \"modified screened Coulomb parameters,\" with U = 6.0 eV and \u03bai,j = 2.0\n(i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1. Note that our modified screened parameters are slightly different from the screened parameters\nreported initially by Chandross and Mazumdar,36 with U = 8.0 eV and \u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1, aimed\nat describing the optical properties of phenyl-based polymers within the PPP model. With our modified screened\nparameters, we obtained excellent agreement between the ab initio GW band gaps,8 and our PPP Hartree-Fock band\ngaps for mono layer AGNRs of various widths,33 therefore, we have used these parameters in the present study of\nmultilayer AGNRs as well.\nIn these calculations, we consider Bernal packed multilayer AGNRs with ABAB... repeat pattern, and two possible\nedge alignments, called \u03b1 and \u03b2 alignments,13 shown in Fig. 1. The intra layer nearest-neighbor (NN) distance was\ntaken to be 1.42 \u00c5, and, for the inter layer separation the value 3.35 \u00c5, identical to that in graphite, was used. As far\nas the hoppings are concerned,\nthe intra layer NN hopping was chosen to be t = 2.7 eV, along with the next-nearest\u2032\nneighbor (NNN) hopping t = 0.27 eV. For the inter-layer hopping also, we considered not only NN hopping t\u22a5 = 0.4\n\u2032\neV, but also the NNN hopping integral t\u22a5 = 0.3 eV.3 We further explore the parameter dependence of the calculated\noptical absorption spectra in section IV B. Because multilayer AGNRs are closed-shell insulating systems, like their\nmono layer counterparts, we used the restricted HF (RHF) method to obtain the band structure in our calculations,\nas described in our previous work.33\n\n\fFigure 1: The structures of bilayer AGNR (a) \u03b1-alignment and (b) \u03b2-alignment\n\nEg(eV)\n\n2\n\n3p\n3p+1\n3p+2\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n2\n\nEg(eV)\n\n(a)\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n(b)\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nWidth(nm)\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Variation of the energy gap with the increasing width for bilayer AGNRs, obtained by the tight-binding\nmethod for (a) \u03b1-alignment (b) \u03b2-alignment.\n\nIII.\n\nENERGY GAPS AND BAND STRUCTURE\nA.\n\nEnergy gaps\n\nThe TB calculations on mono-layer AGNRs37 predicted that AGNR\u2212NA with NA = 3p and NA = 3p + 1 (p\nis a positive integer) exhibit energy gaps (EgNA ), which are inversely proportional to NA , whereas AGNRs with\nNA = 3p + 2 are gapless. Hence, based upon TB theory, they can be classified into three groups with energy gaps\nvarying as Eg3p \u2265 Eg3p+1 \u2265 Eg3p+2 (= 0). However, ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations8 on these\nribbons predicted a different relationship Eg3p+1 \u2265 Eg3p \u2265 Eg3p+2 (6= 0), with the important result that even for\nNA = 3p + 2, AGNRs exhibit nonzero energy gaps, due to the fact that the bond lengths involving the edge atoms\nare shorter than those in the interior. When the decrease in the bond length is incorporated in the TB approach by\nincreasing the corresponding hopping, one also obtains finite gaps for NA = 3p + 2 ribbons, although the relation\nEg3p \u2265 Eg3p+1 \u2265 Eg3p+2 still holds. Based upon first principles DFT calculations Sahu et al.,13,20 discovered that for\nbilayer AGNRs, and other multilayer AGNRs Eg3p+1 \u2265 Eg3p \u2265 Eg3p+2 (6= 0) is valid, in full agreement with the DFT\nresults of Son et al.8 obtained for the mono-layer AGNRs. In what follows we first explore the same relationship using\nthe TB model, and in Figs. 2 and 3 we present the variation of the energy gaps of different families of bilayer and\neight layer AGNRs, respectively, with respect to their widths, both for the \u03b1 and the \u03b2 alignments. The values of of\nthe hopping integrals used in these calculations were as specified in section II, except that the hoppings at the edges\nwere increased by 12%,8 leading to finite band gaps for ribbons with NA = 3p + 2 for the narrow multilayer ribbons.\nAs is obvious from the figure, our results are consistent with the aforesaid relation Eg3p \u2265 Eg3p+1 \u2265 Eg3p+2 valid for\nmono-layer AGNRs at the TB level. Furthermore, for a given width of the bilayer and eight layer AGNRs, band gaps\nwith the \u03b2 alignment are always more than that for the \u03b1 alignment.\nNext, for each of the three families of AGNRs, we examine the variation of the gap as a function of the increasing\nnumber of layers (n) at the TB level, and results of our calculations are presented in Fig. 4a for the \u03b1 alignment, and\nin Fig. 4b for the \u03b2 alignment. Although, these calculations were performed for p = 3, a similar behavior was also\nobserved for other values of p. We find that: (a) again the band gaps for the ribbons in \u03b2-alignment are larger than\nthose for the \u03b1-alignment, and (b) band gaps for both types of alignments saturate fairly rapidly with respect to n,\nsuggesting that a small number of layers are needed to achieve the bulk values.\nIn particular, for the \u03b1-aligned ribbons with NA = 11 (3p + 2 class) , the band gap decreases rapidly with n and\nbecomes negligibly small for large values of n (Fig.4(a), blue/dashed line) whereas, for the \u03b2 alignment the band gap\nis much less sensitive to n and attains a constant value, for smaller values of n (Fig.4(b), blue/dashed line).

From the results it is obvious that the inclusion of the e-e interactions\nleads to the widening up of the band gaps, compared to the TB approach.\nB.\n\nBand structure\n\nFor the sake of brevity, in what follows, we denote a given multilayer AGNR as n-AGNR-NA -\u03b1 (n-AGNR-NA -\u03b2),\nimplying an AGNR with n layers, each of width NA , arranged in \u03b1 (\u03b2) alignment. In our previous work we have\nemphasized the role of long-range e-e interactions in widening the band gaps of the mono-layer AGNRs.33 For example,\n\u03b1-alignment\n\u03b2-alignment\n\nEg(eV)\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nNumber of layers\n\n8\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) Variation of energy gap with number of layers obtained using the PPP model, within the RHF\napproximation, for the multilayer AGNRs with NA = 8, in \u03b1 and \u03b2 alignments.\n\n\f4\n4\n\n(a)\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03b5k(eV)\n\n\u03b5k(eV)\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n0\n\n-2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n-4\n-4\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nk(\u03c0/a)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nk(\u03c0/a)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 6: (Color online) Band structure of (a) 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1 , (b) 2-AGNR-11-\u03b2, obtained using the PPP-RHF approach.\nThe inset contains the magnified band structure near the Fermi energy (EF = 0) of: (a) 2-AGNR-11 (black lines) and (b)\nmono-layer AGNR-11 (red lines).\n\nwe demonstrated that for mono-layer AGNR-11, the Hubbard model based calculations predict a negligible gap, while\nthe PPP-RHF method predicts a gapped system in agreement with the GW calculations.8 We expect the long-range\ne-e interactions, as incorporated in the PPP model, to play a similar role for multilayer AGNRs as well. According to\nthe ab initio DFT calculations of Sahu et al.13,20 , all n-AGNR-NA -\u03b1, of the family NA = 3p + 2, exhibit much smaller\ngaps compared to the other families, suggesting a metal-like behavior. In Figs. 6a and 7 we present the PPP-RHF\nband structures of a few members of this family, 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1, 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1, 4-AGNR-8-\u03b1, and 10-AGNR-8-\u03b1, and\nfrom the figures it is obvious that all these ribbons have substantial band gaps. Therefore, we believe that the ab\ninitio results of Sahu et al.13,20 reporting these systems as almost metallic, are due to the well-known tendency of the\nDFT to underestimate the gaps, and that a better estimate of the gap can only be made by some electron-correlated\napproach such as the GW approximation.8\nWe investigate the effect of edge alignment on the band structure of bilayer AGNRs by presenting the band structure\nof 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1 (Fig.6 (a)), and 2-AGNR-11-\u03b2 (Fig.6(b)). The band structure near the Fermi energy is magnified\nin the insets of those figures, which also contain the band structure of mono-layer AGNR-11. In the presence of the\nsecond layer, each mono-layer band is split into two bands: one with the lower energy and the other with the higher\nenergy, thus reducing the gap. From insets of Figs. 6a and 6b, it is clear that the valence and the conduction bands\nformed due to the aforesaid band splitting for 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1 near EF are separated by larger energy compared to\nthe case of 2-AGNR-11-\u03b2. Therefore, it suggests that the perturbation introduced by the second layer is larger in\nthe case of the \u03b1-aligned AGNRs, as compared to the \u03b2-aligned AGNRs, for which we offer the following geometrical\nexplanation. Intuitively speaking, the layers will interact with each other the most if they were stacked in the AA\narrangement (with all the carbon atoms on top of each other), leading to a more prominent band splitting, and thus\nthe smallest gap possible from various stacking arrangements. For the AB stacking, however, in the \u03b1 case, the\ndifference with respect to the AA stacking is much less because the layers are only displaced in the x direction, while\nin the \u03b2 case, layers are displaced both in the x as well as the y directions, resulting in more disalignment compared\nto the \u03b1 case (cf. Fig. 1). Therefore, in \u03b1 alignment the layers will interact with each other more than those in the\n\u03b2 case, resulting in a band structure more distinct compared to a mono-layer, and, thus, a smaller gap, compared\nto the \u03b2 case. We verified this hypothesis by actually performing the band structure calculations for 2-AGNR-11 in\ndifferent stacking patterns and alignments, and the band gaps (in eV) obtained by using the TB/PPP-RHF method\nwere 0.02/0.43 (AA), 0.04/0.92 (AB-\u03b1) and 0.13/1.12 (AB-\u03b2).\nNext, we illustrate the variation in the band structure with the number of layers (n), by presenting the band\nstructure near EF of 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1 (Fig.7a), 4-AGNR-8-\u03b1 (Fig.7b), and 10-AGNR-8-\u03b1 (Fig.7c). The band structure\nchanges significantly with increasing n, leading not just to more bands, but also causing bands near EF to become\nflatter. Furthermore, this flatness extends more and more into BZ as n increases, which shows up as a tremendous\nincrease in the joint density of states not just due to a denser band structure, but also due to van Hove singularity like\nincrease caused by parallel bands. This has obvious implications for the optical absorption spectra of such ribbons,\nwhich will be discussed further in Sec. IV D.\nC.\n\nEffect of gate bias on the electronic structure\n\nThe variation of band gaps of bilayer AGNRs, when electric (Ez ) is applied along z-direction is quite interesting.\nAb initio DFT study on these systems by Sahu et al.,13 revealed that the band gaps increase with the increasing Ez\nfor ribbons with band gaps below a critical value, and decrease for ribbons with band gaps above this critical value.\nUsing nearest neighbor TB approach, coupled with perturbation theory, they showed that for the \u03b1-aligned ribbons,\n\n\f1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n0.5\nn=4\n\n\u03b5k(eV)\n\nn=3\n\nn = 10\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nk(\u03c0/a)\nFigure 7: Band structure of (a) 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1 , (b) 4-AGNR-8-\u03b1, (c) 10-AGNR-8-\u03b1 near EF obtained using the PPP-RHF\napproach.\n1.2\n\n(a)\n\n2-AGNR-8-\u03b1\n2-AGNR-24-\u03b1\n\nEg(eV)\n\n0.9\n0.6\n0.3\n0\n0\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nEz(V/nm)\n\n(b)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3-AGNR-8-\u03b1\n3-AGNR-24-\u03b1\n\n0.8\n\nEg(eV)\n\n2\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nEz(V/nm)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 8: (Color online) Variation of energy gap with Ez for (a) 2-AGNR-8-\u03b1 and 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1 (b) 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1 and 3AGNR-24-\u03b1, obtained using the PPP-RHF approach.\n\n\u221a\nthe critical band gap \u01ebc = ( 5 \u2212 1)t\u22a5 , so that for t\u22a5 = 0.4, i \u01ebc \u2248 0.25 eV. In Fig. 8a we present the variation\nof band for 2-AGNR-8-\u03b1 and 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1 with Ez , obtained using the PPP-RHF calculations. In the absence of\nEz , the band gap of 2-AGNR-8-\u03b1 is larger than the \u01ebc , hence the band gap decreases with Ez (Fig. 8a, black solid\nline), whereas, the band gap of 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1 in the absence of Ez is less than \u01ebc , hence the band gap increases with\nEz (Fig. 8a, red lines). In Fig. 8b we present the variation of band gap for 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1 and 3-AGNR-24-\u03b1 with\nEz , and we observe a trend similar to the case of the bilayer GNRs for 3-AGNR-8-\u03b1, but for 3-AGNR-24-\u03b1 the gap\nexhibits small oscillations around a uniform value. The trends on the variation of band gaps with Ez , obtained from\nour PPP-RHF calculations are fully consistent with the ab initio DFT results.13,20\nFinally, we examine the variations in the band structures of multilayer AGNRs caused by the gate bias. In the\nabsence of an external electric field, the fundamental gap of all the ribbons is located at k = 0. However, when the\nelectric filed is applied, location of the fundamental gap shifts in the BZ, from k = 0 to finite values of k, similar to\nwhat was observed in the gated multi-layer graphene as well.38 The rightward shift of fundamental gap continues with\nthe increasing Ez which is evident from the Fig. 9 , where we have presented the band structure of of 3-AGNR-24-\u03b1\n\n\f0.5\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n\u03b5k(eV)\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\nEz = 0 v/nm\n\nEz = 1 v/nm\n\nEz = 2 v/nm\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nk(\u03c0/a)\nFigure 9: PPP-RHF band structure of 3-AGNR-24-\u03b1 near EF , for several values of external electric field Ez\n\nfor increasing values of Ez .\nIV.\n\nOPTICAL ABSORPTION SPECTRA\nA.\n\nBasic formalism\n\nThe optical absorption spectrum for incident radiation polarized in x or y or z direction is computed in the form of\nthe corresponding components of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant tensor, i.e., \u01ebii (\u03c9) using the standard\nformula\nX \u02c6 \u03c0/a\n|hc(k)|pi |v(k)i|2\ndk,\n(3)\n\u01ebii (\u03c9) = C\n2 (k)\n{(Ecv (k) \u2212 ~\u03c9)2 + \u03b3 2 }Ecv\nv,c \u2212\u03c0/a\nwhere a is the 1D lattice constant, |c(k)i (|v(k)i) denotes conduction (valence) band state, pi denotes the momentum\noperator in the i-th Cartesian direction, \u03c9 represents the angular frequency of the incident radiation, Ecv (k) =\n\u01ebc (k) \u2212 \u01ebv (k), with \u01ebc (k) (\u01ebv (k)) being the conduction (valence) band eigenvalues of the Fock matrix, \u03b3 is the line\nwidth, while C includes rest of the constants. As in our previous work,33 the momentum matrix elements hc(k)|pi |v(k)i\nwere computed numerically using the formula proposed by Pedersen et al.39\nB.\n\nSensitivity of the optical absorption to Hamiltonian parameters\n\nBefore we present and discuss our results on the optical absorption in multilayer ANGRs, we examine their sensitivity\nto the hopping and the Coulomb parameters used in the PPP model Hamiltonian. We used two sets of Coulomb\nparameters: U = 6.0 eV and \u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1 (our modified screened parameters33) and U = 8.0 eV\nand \u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1 (original screened parameters of Chandross and Mazumdar36 ). Similarly, for the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhoppings we used two sets: commonly used values of t = 2.7 eV ,t = 0.27 eV, t\u22a5 = 0.4 eV, t\u22a5 = 0.3 eV, and a set\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith larger values of hoppings, viz ., t = 3.16,t = 0.316, t\u22a5 = 0.39 eV, and t\u22a5 = 0.315.40 In Figs. IV B and IV B\nwe present the results of these calculations for the ribbons 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1 and 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1, respectively. From the\nfigures the following trends emerge: (a) For 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1, the change of hoppings (red line vs black line) does not\nchange the results significantly, but the increase in the value of U (U = 6 vs. U = 8) leads to a prominent blue\nshift in the spectrum, (b) For 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1, however, the situation is different because change in hopping leads to\nmore significant changes in the spectrum, as compared to the change in U . Therefore, the dependence of the optical\nabsorption on the Hamiltonian parameters is itself dependent on the nature of the multilayer ribbon concerned.\nBecause, at present no experimental information is available as to the optical absorption spectra of GNRs, thus, it\nis impossible to judge as to what are the correct set of parameters to be used in the Hamiltonian. Therefore, given\nour past experience with the modified screened parameters (U = 6.0 eV and \u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1), and the\n\n\f20\n\nU=6\n\n15 (a)\n\n\u03b5xx(arb.units)\n\n10\n5\n0\n20\n\nU=8\n\n15 (b)\n10\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03c9(eV)\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFigure 10: (Color online) Optical absorption spectra of 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1 calculated using the PPP-RHF approach for the light\npolarized along the x axis with Coulomb parameters (a) U = 6.0 eV and \u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1 and (b) U = 8.0 eV and\n\u2032\n\u03bai,j = 2.0 (i 6= j) and \u03bai,i = 1.

In Fig. 12 a we present the optical absorption spectrum for\nlight polarized along the periodicity direction (x axis, \u01ebxx (\u03c9)), where \u03a3mn denotes a peak in the spectrum due to a\ntransition from m-th valence band (counted from the top) to the n-th conduction band (counted from the bottom).\nFor \u03b1-alignment (black line), the first peak of \u01ebxx (\u03c9) at 1.06 eV is \u03a311 , while the one at 1.96 eV represents \u03a322 . For\nthe \u03b2 alignment (red line) \u03a311 peak is located at 1.30 eV, while the second peak (\u03a322 ) at 1.67 eV. The separation\nbetween the first two peaks is larger in the case of \u03b1-alignment, as compared to that in the \u03b2 alignment. This is a\nconsequence of the observation discussed in Sec. III B that the energy separation between the adjacent bands near\nFermi energy at k = 0 is larger in the \u03b1-alignment compared to \u03b2 -alignment.\nIn Fig. 12b, the absorption spectra corresponding to the y-polarized photons (\u01ebyy (\u03c9)) is presented, and the first\npeak for the \u03b1 alignment (black line) located at 2.61 eV represents \u03a314 , the second peak at 2.69 eV is \u03a322 , while the\npeak at 3.3 eV is \u03a351 . Significant differences in \u01ebyy (\u03c9) are observed for the \u03b2 alignment: it starts with two tiny peaks,\nwith the first one (\u03a311 ) at 1.30 eV, and the second one at 1.67 eV (\u03a322 ), which were absent in case of the \u03b1 alignment.\nThe intense peaks for \u03b2 -alignment are located at 2.62 eV (\u03a314 ), which is coincidental with the same peak for the \u03b1\ncase, and 3 eV (\u03a341 +\u03a323 ) which is located in the similar energy range as the higher peaks of the \u03b1 case.\nFinally, we examine the z polarized component of the absorption spectra (\u01ebzz (\u03c9)) presented in Fig. 12c, for 2AGNR-8. In the low energy regime \u01ebzz (\u03c9) follows \u01ebxx (\u03c9) very closely , but the magnitude of the peaks of \u01ebzz (\u03c9) is\nreduced significantly compared to the peaks of \u01ebxx (\u03c9), because of the weak inter-layer coupling.

The black lines represent the \u03b1 alignment case, while the red lines denote\nthe \u03b2 alignment. A line width of 0.05 eV was assumed throughout.\n\npeak at 1.06 eV is \u03a311 and second peak at 1.96 eV is \u03a322 , while for the \u03b2 alignment, the corresponding peaks are at\n1.30 eV, and 1.67, respectively. One very important difference in the spectra of the two types of alignments is that\nthe peak intensities in the lower energy region are much higher in the \u03b1-alignment, than in the \u03b2-alignment.\nTherefore, the absorption spectra for each polarization direction bring out distinct features depending on the type\nof edge alignment, which can be used in the experiments on oriented samples to determine the type of alignment.\nD.\n\nVariation of optical absorption with the number of layers\n\nRecently, Wright et al.14 using the TB calculations performed on 3p + 2 family of bilayer AGNRs, showed that\nthe inter-layer coupling causes strong inter subband transitions, leading to tremendous enhancement in the optical\nconductivity in the low-energy region, thus, making them suitable candidates for opto-electronic applications. In\nFig. 13 we present the optical absorption spectra for 1-AGNR-11, 2-AGNR-11-\u03b1, and 3-AGNR-11-\u03b1, calculated using\nthe PPP-RHF approach for the x-polarized light, with the aim of understanding the influence of n on the optical\nabsorption. In 1-AGNR-11, the \u03a311 peak of \u01ebxx (\u03c9) is located at 1.31 eV, while in 2-AGNR-11, and 3-AGNR-11\nit becomes more intense, and successively gets red shifted to 0.94 eV and 0.84 eV, respectively. A similar trend is\nobserved also for other transition peaks as well, as well as for the peaks in \u01ebyy (\u03c9) and \u01ebzz (\u03c9) (figures not shown).\nAlthough, the band gaps obtained using the PPP-RHF approach are much larger than that using the TB method,\nyet the tendency towards the enhancement of the optical response with the increasing value of n in the lower energy\nregion is obvious from these plots. This behavior is fully consistent with the earlier discussion in Sec. III A that the\nenhancement of the optical response in the lower energy region of multilayer AGNRs can be understood in terms of\nthe redshift of the fundamental gap, and the increase in the joint density of states near EF , with increasing n.\nE.\n\nEffect of gate bias on the optical absorption\n\nAs discussed in Sec. III B, a gate bias has profound effects on the electronic structure of multilayer AGNRs, and,\ntherefore, it is of great interest to understand the effect of electric field on the optical properties of these systems.

A line width of 0.05 eV assumed throughout.\n\nin the plot. In 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1, peak \u03a311 , which corresponds to the fundamental gap, gets red shifted, without much\nchange in the intensity at Ez = 1V/nm. But, for Ez = 2 V/nm, besides exhibiting the redshift, the peak also becomes\nmore intense. In case of 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1, whose gap is less than \u01ebc , the \u03a311 peak expectedly blue shifts with increasing\nEz , however, it loses significant intensity as the field is increased from Ez = 0 to Ez = 1 V/nm. However, upon further\nincreasing the field to Ez = 2 V/nm, no significant change in the intensity is observed. Thus, as far as the intensity\nof \u03a311 peak with increasing gate bias is concerned, 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1 and 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1 behave quite differently. To\nelucidate this point further, in Fig.15 we present the variation of the heights of the the \u03a311 peaks of 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1\nand 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1, as functions of the gate field, in the range 0 \u2264 Ez \u2264 2.5 V/nm. Recalling that the height of a\npeak is proportional to the oscillator strength of the corresponding transition, we observe the following trends: (a)\nfor 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1 the intensity varies slowly for 0 \u2264 Ez \u2264 1.0 V/nm, thereafter it increases monotonically, while (b)\nfor 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1 the intensity decreases rapidly for 0 \u2264 Ez \u2264 1.0 V/nm, and, thereafter it exhibits slow oscillations\naround a constant value. Thus, the two ribbons exhibit opposite behavior as far as the dependence of the oscillator\nstrength of \u03a311 peak on the bias field is concerned. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the experimental21,23 and\ntheoretical30 results on bilayer graphene, which report a monotonic increase in the intensity of the first peak, with\nan increasing gate bias. This peculiar behavior of the peak intensity as a function of the gate bias can be tested in\noriented samples of multilayer AGNRs, and can be used to distinguish between the widths of such ribbons.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn summary, we have used the PPP model based \u03c0-electron approach, incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions, to study the electronic structure and optical properties of multilayer AGNRs, at the mean-field Hartree\nFock level. We considered two types of edge alignments namely \u03b1 and \u03b2, both in Bernal (AB) stacking pattern,\nand systematically studied the variation of band gaps and optical absorption spectra of multilayer AGNRs with the\nincreasing number of layers. These calculations have demonstrated anisotropic optical response of multilayer AGNRs,\nwith the calculated absorption spectra being crucially dependent on the polarization direction of the incident light.\n\n\f(a)\n\n4.4\n3.3\n0\n\nPeak strength of \u03a311\n\nPeak strength of \u03a311\n\n5.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n(b)\n60\n30\n0\n0\n\nEz(V/nm)\n\nFigure 15: Variation of peak strength of \u03a311 transition of \u01ebxx with static electric field Ez , computed using the PPP-RHF\nmethod, for: (a) 2-AGNR-12-\u03b1 (b) 2-AGNR-24-\u03b1.\n\nFurthermore, the optical response has been shown to depend upon the type of the edge alignment (\u03b1 vs. \u03b2) and the\nnumber of layers, leading to the possible experimental determination of the nature of the edge alignment, and the\nnumber of layers in the system, using optical probes. Our calculations also reveal that a gate bias along the inter-layer\ndirection not only alters the peak positions in the absorption spectra due to the change in the band gaps, but also\nthe peak intensities (oscillator strengths) in a nontrivial way. The variation of the peak intensities as a function of\nthe gate bias is of the opposite nature for the narrow and the broad bilayer AGNRs, a behavior in sharp contrast to\nbilayer graphene. These predictions of ours can be tested in optical experiments performed on the oriented samples\nof multilayer AGNRs.\nAs far as the future studies on multilayer AGNRs are concerned, it will be interesting to probe the influence of\nelectron-correlation effects on various properties studied here. Furthermore, the nature of excitons in multilayer\nAGNRs should be investigated, so as to provide a complete description of the linear optical absorption spectra of\nmultilayer AGNRs. Calculations along those directions are underway in our group, and results will be reported in\nfuture publications.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, for providing financial support\nfor this work under Grant No. SR/S2/CMP-13/2006.
