The weak and strong\nphase differences are a measure of the CP asymmetry ACP . It can be obtained from the difference\nbetween the B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + branching fractions. For instance the recent BABAR\nCollaboration isobar model Dalitz-plot analysis [1] gives for the B \u00b1 decay into \u03c1(770)0 \u03c0 \u00b1 ,\n\u0001\nACP [B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1(770)0 \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c1(770)0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] = 18 \u00b1 7 \u00b1 5+2\n(1)\n\u221214 %.\n\nThese rare weak decays arise from W -boson exchange, which, together with the fact that the b quark\nmass, mb , is large leads, for the short distance amplitude, to a systematic perturbative calculation in\na QCD framework. One further assumes factorization which amounts to express the long distance amplitude in terms of form factors [2]. The final state hadronic interactions introduce however important\nsources of uncertainties.\nPresented at the fifth Asia-Pacific Conference on Few-Body Problems in Physics, Seoul, Republic of Korea,\nAugust 21-26, 2011.

If no QCD factorization formalism exists for\nthree-body B decays, one can however use a quasi two-body approach. In the B rest frame of the\nthree-body B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays and for low invariant \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + mass, m\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+ < 2 GeV, the \u03c0 + and\n\u03c0 \u2212 mesons of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + pair move more or less in the same direction. On can then reduce the study\nof the three-body B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays to that of quasi two-body B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 [\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ] decays provided\nwe make the hypothesis that the states of the [\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ] pair originate from a quark-antiquark q q\u0304 state.\nSuch an approach has been recently applied by some of us to B \u2192 K\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays by studying\nB \u2192 K[\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]S,P [4, 5] and B \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 [K\u03c0 \u2213 ]S,P [6, 7]. In these works, the long distance [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]S S-wave\nstate includes the scalar f0 (600) and f0 (980) resonances [4, 5] while the P -wave [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]P state [5] takes\ninto account the vector meson \u03c1(770)0 . In Refs. [6, 7] the long range S-wave [K\u03c0 \u2213 ]S state incorporates\nthe scalar \u03ba(800), K0\u2217 (1430) resonances and the P -wave [K\u03c0 \u2213 ]P pair the vector meson K \u2217 (892).\nIn the present work we introduce the quasi two-body decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]S,P,D including,\nfor the long range amplitude in [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]S the scalar f0 (600), f0 (980), f0 (1400), in [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]P , the vector\n\u03c1(770)0 , \u03c1(1450)0 , \u03c1(1700)0 and in [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]D the tensor f2 (1270). For the short distance amplitudes\nwe shall introduce the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading order (NLO) vertex and penguin\ncorrections. A full account of the work we present here can be found in Ref.

(1) of Ref. [8]. The VCKM factor arises from product of Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa matrix elements giving the strength of the coupling of the quarks to the W boson. The Oi (\u03bc)\nare local operators and the Ci (\u03bc) are the short range Wilson coefficients coming from the W exchange\nand calculated at the renormalization scale \u03bc, \u03bc \u223c mb . Furthermore, schematically, the ansatz of\nfactorization reads,\n\u221e\nhM1 M2 |Oi (\u03bc)|Bi = hM1 |j1 |0ihM2 |j2 |Bi [1 + \u03a3n=1\nrn \u03b1ns + O(\u039bQCD /mb )] ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere j1,2 are bilinear quark currents. The matrix element hM1 |j1 |0i is given in terms of the decay\nconstant of the meson M1 while hM2 |j2 |Bi can be calculated using the B to M2 transition form factor.\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2 The light effective m\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 distributions from the fit to the BABAR data [1], a) for the B \u2212 and b) for\nthe B + decays.

The\nmatrix elements hRS,P,D |j1 |B \u00b1 i correspond to the B \u00b1 to RS,P,D transition form factors for which we\ntake RS \u2261 f0 (980), RP \u2261 \u03c1(770)0 and RD \u2261 f2 (1270). The term h\u03c0 \u00b1 |j2 |0i is related to the pion\ndecay constant f\u03c0 . In our model, we assume the GnRS,P \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 (q 2 ), GnRD \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 (q 2 ) vertex functions to be\nproportional to the scalar or vector pion form factor and to a relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitude [1] for\nthe resonance f2 (1270), respectively. From the matrix elements given in Eqs. (4) and (5) one obtains\nthe total symmetrized amplitudes for B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decays as given in Eqs. (21) to (26) of Ref. [8].\nScalar form factor\nThe normalized pion scalar form factor, \u03931n\u2217 (q 2 ), which is proportional to the form\np\n \u0304 , is calculated from a unitary relativistic coupled channel\nfactor F0 (q 2 ) = 3/8 [\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ]S |u\u016b + dd|0\nmodel including \u03c0\u03c0, K K\u0304 and effective (2\u03c0)(2\u03c0) interactions (see Eqs. (27) and (28) of Ref. [8]). The\nneeded \u03c0\u03c0 scattering T matrix corresponds to the solution A of Ref. [10]. The result of our fit (see\nnext section) for the modulus of \u03931n\u2217 (q 2 ) is plotted in Fig. 1.\nVector form factor The pion vector form factor results from the Belle Collaboration analysis [12] of\nhigh statistics \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03c4 decay data with a Gounaris-Sakurai model for the three vector resonances\n\u03c1(770), \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700). We use their parameters given in the third column of their Table VII.\n3 Fit to B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decay data\nWe fit the B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 BABAR Collaboration data with three parameters for the S wave,\none for the P wave and one, F Bf2 (m2\u03c0 ), for the D wave. The \u03c72 fit to the 170 data points from\n\n\f4\n\nBABAR's invariant mass distributions together with the experimental branching ratio BP for B \u00b1 \u2192\n\u22126\n\u03c1(770)0 \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c1(770)0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 = (8.1 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 1.2+0.4\nis \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 231.6/(171 \u2212 4) = 1.39. The\n\u22121.1 ) \u00d7 10\nfitted strength of the S-wave amplitude \u03c7S = \u221219.4 \u00b1 2.5 GeV\u22121 , the two other parameters of the\nscalar pion form factor being listed in the caption of Fig. 1. The fitted deviation from 1 of the strength\nof the P -wave amplitude is NP = 1.122 \u00b1 0.034.\nWe obtain a good agreement with the experimental m\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 distributions as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nWe find a sizeable contribution of the S wave just above the \u03c0\u03c0 threshold corresponding to the f0 (600)\ncontribution. The f0 (980) is not seen as a peak since the pion scalar form factor has a dip near 1 GeV\nas seen in Fig. 1. The signal for the f0 (1400) associated with the opening of the effective (2\u03c0)(2\u03c0)\nchannel (see Fig. 1) is tiny. Looking at the distributions (see Ref. [8]) for the cosine of the helicity\nangle > 0 and < 0, one observes significant interference contributions, mainly between the S and P\nwaves, under the dominant \u03c1(770)0 peak.\n4 Conclusions and outlook\nIt is quite instructive to see that the quasi two-body QCD factorization allows i) to correlate heavy\nmeson hadronic decay data with other meson-meson interaction data and ii) to give constraints between\nstrong and weak interaction physics. The determination of the strong interaction phases should help in\nthe extraction of the weak angle phase \u03b3 or \u03c63 = arg(\u2212\u03bb\u2217u /\u03bb\u2217c ). Our S-wave amplitude is proportional\nto \u03931n\u2217 (s), its functional form could be used in Dalitz-plot analyses and values can be sent upon request.\nHere the data constrain strongly the non-strange pion scalar from factor and in particular its highenergy behavior. It would be interesting if some semi-leptonic process could constraint the pion scalar\nform factor as in the case of the vector one. On-shell non-strange and strange pion scalar form factors\nhave been used to describe successfully the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave final state interaction in B \u2192 K\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [4, 5].\nOne should check if the non-strange pion scalar form factor derived here together with the needed\nstrange component \u221d [K K\u0304]S |ss\u0304|0 would yield an equally succesfull description of the data.\nThe CP asymmetry for the B to \u03c1\u03c0 decay is ACP [B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1(770)0 \u03c0 \u00b1 , \u03c1(770)0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] = 3.6% \u00b1\n0.2% which is compatible with the experimental value given in Eq. (1). One expects results with smaller\nerrors from the Belle Collaboration, and hopefully, in the near future, from LHCb and from the near\nterm super B factories.\nReferences\n1.
