Introduction\nIn this paper we are concerned with the uniqueness of ground states of\nthe coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger system:\nX\n(1)\n\u03b2ij |\u03c6i |p+1 |\u03c6j |p\u22121 \u03c6j ,\n\u2212i\u2202t \u03c6j = \u2206\u03c6j + \u03bcj |\u03c6j |2p \u03c6j +\ni6=j\n\nwhere \u03c6j = \u03c6j (t, x) \u2208 C, x \u2208 Rn , t > 0, j = 1, ..., N . Here 0 < p < 2/(n\u22122)+\n(we use the convention: 2/(n\u22122)+ = +\u221e when n = 1, 2, and (n\u22122)+ = n\u22122\nwhen n \u2265 3), \u03bcj 's and \u03b2ij 's are coupling constants subjected to \u03b2ij = \u03b2ji .\nThe model (1) has applications in many physical problems, especially in\nnonlinear optics. An application of (1) comes from [1], the solution \u03c6j denotes the j th component of the beam in Kerr-like photo-refractive media.\nThe constant \u03bcj is for self-focusing in the j th component of the beam. The\ncoupling constant \u03b2ij is the interaction between the ith and the j th component of the beam. We refer to [4] for more precision on the meaning of the\nconstants. Another application of (1) arises in [10]. When two optical waves\nof different frequencies co-propagate in a medium and interact nonlinearly\nthrough the medium, or when two polarization components of a wave interact nonlinearly at some central frequency, the propagation equations for\nThe research is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n10631020 and SRFDP 20060003002.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLI MA AND LIN ZHAO\n\nthe two problems can be considered together as the following N coupled\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger-like equations for the case N = 2:\n!\n!\nN\nN\nX\nX\n2\n2\n2\nqij \u03c6i \u03c6 \u0304j = 0,\npij |\u03c6i | \u03c6j +\ni\u2202t \u03c6j + \u2202x \u03c6j + \u03baj \u03c6j +\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere j = 1, ..., N , \u03c6j denotes the complex amplitude of the j th electric\nfield envelope, or the j th polarization component, pij 's , qij 's and \u03baj 's are\nparameters characteristic of the medium and interaction. Especially, when\n\u03baj = 0 and qij = 0, it reduces to our model problem (1) where n = 1 and\np = 1.\nTo obtain solitary solutions of the system (1), we set \u03c6j (t, x) = eit uj (x)\n(uj \u2208 R) and transform the system (1) to steady-state N coupled nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equations given by\nX\nuj \u2212 \u2206uj = \u03bcj |uj |2p uj +\n(2)\n\u03b2ij |ui |p+1 |uj |p\u22121 uj , j = 1, ..., N.\ni6=j\n\nThe concept of incoherent solitary solutions have attracted considerable attentions in the last ten years, both from experimental and theoretical point\nof view. The two experimental studies [20] and [22] demonstrated the existence of solitary waves made from both spatially and temporally incoherent\nlight. These papers were followed by a large amount of theoretical work\non incoherent solitary waves, see for example [4, 10, 11] and the references\ntherein. The energy functional of (2) is\nN\n\n1X\nE(u) :=\n2\ni=1\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\nN\n\n2\n\nRn\n\n1\n2p + 2\n\n|\u2207ui | +\nN\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nZ\n\nRn\n\nu2i\n\n\u0001\n\n1 X\n\u2212\n2p + 2\ni=1\n\nZ\n\nRn\n\n\u03bci u2p+2\ni\n\n\u03b2ij |ui |p+1 |uj |p+1 .\n\nThis functional is well defined if ui \u2208 H 1 (Rn ), by virtue of the embedding\nH 1 (Rn ) \u0592\u2192 L2p+2 (Rn ) with 0 < p < 2/(n \u2212 2)+ . We will always consider\nsolitary waves with finite energy, and will be particularly interested in the\nleast energy nontrivial solutions of (2), which are named ground states in\nPhysics.\nLet's recall some previous work about the ground states of (2) related to\nour research in this paper. In order to simplify the presentation, we shall\nconcentrate on the system of two equations:\n\u001a\nu1 \u2212 \u2206u1 = \u03bc1 |u1 |2p u1 + \u03b2|u2 |p+1 |u1 |p\u22121 u1 ,\n(3)\nu2 \u2212 \u2206u2 = \u03bc2 |u2 |2p u2 + \u03b2|u1 |p+1 |u2 |p\u22121 u2 .\nA solution u = (u1 , u2 ) of (3) is called nontrivial if u1 \u2261\n6 0 and u2 6\u2261 0\nsimultaneously. The nontrivial weak solutions of (3) are equivalent to the\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF GROUND STATES OF NLS\n\n3\n\nnontrivial critical points of the energy functional\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n|\u2207u1 |2 + u21 + |\u2207u2 |2 + u22\nE(u) =\n2 Rn\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n1\n2p+2\np+1\np+1\n\u2212\n\u03bc1 u2p+2\n+\n2\u03b2|u\n|\n|u\n|\n+\n\u03bc\nu\n1\n2\n2 2\n1\n2p + 2 Rn\n\nin the Sobolev space H := H 1 (Rn ) \u00d7 H 1 (Rn ).

The nonnegative minima of the minimization problem\n(4)\n\nc := inf E(u)\nu\u2208N\n\nis called the ground state of (3).\nIn the case of a single nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the ground state\nexists [3] and was proved to be the positive solution of\n(5)\n\n\u2206u \u2212 u + u2p+1 = 0.\n\nThe positive solution of (5) is radial symmetric about some fixed point [8]\nand is unique in the sense of moduling translations [12]. We denote it by \u03c9\nhereafter.\nQuite differently from the case of a single equation, the existence of ground\nstates solutions with multi-components of the system (2) is much more complicated than the single case and was studied quite well when \u03bcj > 0 in the\nseries of the papers [2, 15, 21, 23]. Roughly speaking, they proved that\nthere always exist ranges of positive parameters uj 's, \u03b2ij 's in (2), for which\nthis system has a least energy solution, and ranges of positive parameters\nfor which the energy functional can't be minimized on the Nehari manifold where the eventual solutions lie. Readers can consult these papers for\nfurther details.\nHowever, the uniqueness of positive solutions of the system (2) is a widely\nopen problem, and to our knowledge no results have been already known in\nthis direction. In our present paper, we discuss the ground state of (2) in\nthe case \u03bcj \u2264 0, which has not been considered before, and we will prove\nthat in this case the ground state is unique. The uniqueness of ground states\nwhen \u03bcj > 0 remains open. To be precise, our result reads as follows.\nTheorem 2. Consider the steady-state two coupled nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequations in Rn\n\u001a\nu1 \u2212 \u2206u1 = \u03bc1 |u1 |2p u1 + \u03b21 |u2 |p+1 |u1 |p\u22121 u1 ,\n(6)\nu2 \u2212 \u2206u2 = \u03bc2 |u2 |2p u2 + \u03b22 |u1 |p+1 |u2 |p\u22121 u2 ,\n\n\f4\n\nLI MA AND LIN ZHAO\n\nin which 0 < p < 2/(n \u2212 2)+ .

Moreover, the ground state can be determined explicitly by\n\uf8f1\n\u0013\u22121/2p\n\u0012\n(p+1)/2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b22\n\uf8f4\n\u03c9,\n\uf8f2 u1 = \u03bc1 + (p\u22121)/2\n\u03b21\n(9)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22121/2p\n(p+1)/2\n\uf8f4\n\u03b2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c9,\n\uf8f3 u2 = \u03bc2 + 1(p\u22121)/2\n\u03b22\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the unique positive solution of (5).\n\nAs far as we know, there are only two results about the uniqueness of\npositive solutions to stationary Schrodinger systems. One is in [13]. The\nother one is in [16], where the radial symmetry and uniqueness results have\nbeen obtained for the non-negative solutions to the schrodinger system\n(I \u2212 \u2206)u = v p , (I \u2212 \u2206)v = uq .\nOne may see [6] for related uniqueness result.\nWe now give some remarks about the conditions (7) and (8).\nRemark 3. The condition (7) implies that\n!\n!\n(p+1)/2\n(p+1)/2\n\u03b21p\n\u03b22\n\u03b21\n\u03bc2 + (p\u22121)/2 = p \u03bc1 + (p\u22121)/2 ,\n\u03b22\n\u03b22\n\u03b21\nand hence in (8)\n(p+1)/2\n\n(p+1)/2\n\n\u03bc1 +\n\n\u03b22\n\n(p\u22121)/2\n\n\u03b21\n\n> 0 \u21d4 \u03bc2 +\n\n\u03b21\n\n(p\u22121)/2\n\n\u03b22\n\n> 0.\n\nRemark 4. It's easy to check that the special case\n(10)\n\n\u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = \u03bc \u2264 0,\n\n\u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b2\n\nand\n\n\u03bc+\u03b2 > 0\n\nsatisfies (7) and (8). Conversely, any other constants satisfying (7) and (8)\ncan be transformed to the case (10) by scaling. In fact, set\nw1 (x) := a1 u1 (x),\n\nw2 (x) := a2 u2 (x),\n\nwhere a1 , a2 > 0 are the scaling constants. Then the equations (6) can be\nwritten as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 w1 \u2212 \u2206w1 = \u03bc2p1 w12p+1 + p\u22121\u03b21 p+1 w1p w2p+1 ,\n\uf8f3 w2 \u2212 \u2206w2 =\n\na1\n\u03bc2 2p+1\nw2\na2p\n2\n\na1\n\n+\n\na2\np p+1\n\u03b22\n.\np+1 w2 w1\nap\u22121\na\n2\n1\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF GROUND STATES OF NLS\n\n5\n\nThe condition (7) guarantees the existence of a1 , a2 > 0 such that\n\u03bc1\na2p\n1\n\n=\n\n\u03bc2\na2p\n2\n\n:= \u03bc,\n\n\u03b21\np\u22121 p+1\na1 a2\n\n=\n\n\u03b22\np\u22121 p+1\na2 a1\n\n:= \u03b2.\n\nIndeed, we can choose without loss of generality that\na1 = 1,\n\na2 = (\n\n\u03b21 1/2\n)\n\u03b22\n\nand thus\n(p+1)/2\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc1 ,\n\n\u03b22\n\n\u03b2=\n\n(p\u22121)/2\n\n\u03b21\n\n.\n\nThe condition (8) is just that \u03bc + \u03b2 > 0.\nRemark 5. The relation \u03bc + \u03b2 > 0 in (10) plays a crucial role to ensure\nthat the Nehari manifold N 6= \u2205.\nAs is well known, the sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality plays extremely important roles in the quantitative analysis of blow-up solutions\nof the single Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A large amount of work relies heavily\non the sharp constant in the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. We shall only\nquote here [18, 19, 24, 25, 26] where a comprehensive list of references on\nthis subject can be found. As an application of Theorem 2, we can obtain a\nsharp vector-valued Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. To our experience, the\nsharp vector-valued Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality we obtain here would\nplay some non-negligible roles in further studies of Schr\u00f6dinger systems.\nCorollary 6.

Somewhat surprisingly, our arguments to prove Theorem 2 and\ncorollary 6 can't be generalized to the N coupled Schr\u00f6dinger system with\nN \u2265 3. So we have to leave the case N \u2265 3 as an open problem. For\nthe scalar Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in its general form, one may see\nE.Hebey's book [9].\nTo prove Theorem 2, we only deal with the standard case (10) of (6),\nas what we have explained in Remark 4. In section 2, we use Schwartz\nsymmetrization to prove that the minimization problem (4) can be achieved\nby a positive solution of the system (6), which indicates the existence of\nground states in a more general case. In section 3, we transform (6) to\na system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) by virtue of the radial\nsymmetry of positive solutions of (6). Then by the comparison technique of\nODE, we arrive at the uniqueness of positive solutions of (6). Since all the\nground sates must be positive solutions of (6), we conclude that the ground\nstate is unique. In section 4, we prove the sharp vector-valued GagliardoNirenberg inequality (Corollary 6) in detail.\n2. Existence of ground states\nThis section is devoted to the proof of the existence of ground states of\n(6) in the case\n(12)\n\n\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 \u2264 0 and \u03bc1 + \u03b2 > 0,\n\n\u03bc2 + \u03b2 > 0.\n\nThe existence of ground states of (6) when \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 > 0 has been extensively\nstudied in the papers [2, 15, 21, 23] using the method of Schwartz symmetrization. We declare that this symmetrization method still works for\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF GROUND STATES OF NLS\n\n7\n\nthe case (12) under our consideration. Since our proof would have many details different from the ones in the preceding papers, we will give our proof\nthoroughly for the purpose of completeness. We point out that our proof,\nwhich combines the analysis in [2] and [15], could be seen as a simplified\nversion of their arguments.\nWe have the following proposition, which asserts that all the critical points\nof the minimization problem (4) must be weak solutions of (6) in H.\nProposition 9. If the minimization problem (4) is attained by a coupled\nu \u2208 N , then u is a solution of (6).\nProof. The proof of Proposition 9 is similar to the one in [2].

The following\nlemma [14] is at the heart of our argument.\n\n\f8\n\nLI MA AND LIN ZHAO\n\nLemma 10.

With the help of Proposition 9, we see it remains only to verify that\nthe minimum of c in (4) can be attained by a pair of positive functions in\nN .

Let u\u2217k = (u\u2217k,1 , u\u2217k,2 ) be\nthe Schwartz symmetrization of uk .

By the well-known compact\nembedding from radial symmetric functions in H 1 (Rn ) to L2p+2 (Rn ) [25],\none can assume that u\u2217k \u2192 u\u2217 in L2p+2 (Rn )\u00d7L2p+2 (Rn ). By Fatou's lemma,\nu\u2217 \u2208 N , and\nc = E(u\u2217 ).\nMoreover, from (13), we deduce that u\u22171 6\u2261 0, u\u22172 6\u2261 0.\nStep 2.

The maximum principle applied to each single equation in (6) suggests\nthat u\u22171 > 0, u\u22172 > 0 and the proof of the existence of ground states of (6) is\nfinished.\nStep 4. We assert that all the ground states must be positive solutions\nof (6). In fact, Proposition 9 demonstrates that all the ground states are\nnonnegative solutions of (6) and each component of the solutions is nonzero.\nBy the strong maximum principle, these solutions must be strictly positive.\nThe proof of Theorem 11 is complete.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nLI MA AND LIN ZHAO\n\n3.
