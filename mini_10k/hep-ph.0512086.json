Applying the criterion\nof naturalness, based on the idea of \"custodial symmetry\", we show that all the LFV\nprocesses, independently of specific mechanisms behind them, but with the same external\nleptons, have a priori comparable amplitudes modulo their kinematics and involved form\nfactors.\n\nPACS: 11.30.Fs, 11.30.Hv, 12.15.-y, 12.60.-i\nKEYWORDS: lepton flavor violation, new physics.\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillations has established the presence of neutrino masses and\nmixing between neutrino species with different lepton flavors [1]. This is the first observation\nof a lepton flavor violating (LFV) process, forbidden in the SM. Theoretically, the observed\nLFV cannot be isolated in the neutrino sector. Indeed, it naturally extends to the sector of\ncharged leptons via the LFV charged current loop with virtual neutrinos, and then it should\nmanifest itself in the form of yet unobserved LFV processes with charged leptons, such as \u03bc, \u03c4\nand meson LFV decays, \u03bc\u2212 \u2212 e\u2212 nuclear conversion, etc. The LFV in the charged lepton\nsector may also receive contributions directly from physics beyond the SM. For this reason\nexperimental and theoretical studies of LFV charged lepton processes are expected to shed\nlight on the fundamental sources of LFV, offering one of the most direct ways to observe\nphysics beyond the SM.\nIn the present note we do not consider the possible origin of LFV. Instead, we focus on the\ninterplay between different LFV processes in the sector of charged leptons. A central point\nof the present study can be formulated as the question: if there is information on some LFV\nprocess, say, an experimental upper limit for its rate or its observation at a certain rate, then,\nwhat can be expected for the rates of other LFV processes? Gauge invariance and unitarity\nhave already been applied in the literature to relate the rates of some of the LFV processes\nbetween each other [2]. The conclusions made in the present note, on the other hand, derive\n1\n\n\ffrom the absence of certain global \"custodial symmetry\". We will show that there exists a\nnatural one-to-one correspondence between the amplitudes of LFV processes with the same\ncharged lepton flavor structure, that is those processes which result in the same change of the\nlepton flavors Li . Our answer to the above question is that the natural difference in the rates of\nthe LFV processes with the same lepton flavor structure should be attributed to the difference\nin their kinematics and phase space, whereas an additional strong suppression of some of these\nprocesses with respect to others is unnatural and thus, improbable.\nLet us consider processes where LFV manifests itself via the presence of two charged external\nleptons (li , lj ), and which conserve baryon number B and either conserve total lepton number\n\u2206L = 0 (LFV) or violate it in two units \u2206L = 2 (LFNV). In addition to the two charged leptons\nthese processes may involve an arbitrary set of external particles satisfying certain consistency\nconditions to be specified below.\nFor convenience we consider processes with the two leptons in the final state and all the other\nparticipating particles in the initial state. Nevertheless, as will be seen latter our conclusions\nare valid for LFV and LFNV process with any configuration of initial and final states.\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\nTherefore, we focus on the processes: \u03a6k \u2192 li\u2212 lj+ with \u2206L = 0, and \u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 with\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\u2206L = \u22122, where \u03a6k and \u03a6k\ndenote certain color-singlet subsets of external particles with\nB = 0, Li = 0 and total electric charge Q = 0 and Q = \u22122, respectively. The difference between\nprocesses with the same lepton flavor structure li lj resides in the difference of their external\nparticle subsets \u03a6k . The possible sets of the SM particles in both LFV and LFNV cases are of\nthe following two types:\n(0)\n\nType I: \u03a60\nType II:\n\n(0)\n\u03a6k\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\n\u03a6k\n\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\n= W \u2212 W + , \u03a60\n= W \u2212W \u2212,\nn\non\no\n \u0304 ... ( \u0304li li ), (W \u2212 W + ), \u03b3, Z, ... ,\n= (\u016bu), (dd),\n \u0304 ...\n= (\u016bd)(\u016bd) (\u016bu), (dd),\nn\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n( \u0304li li ), (W \u2212 W + ), \u03b3, Z, ... .\n\non\n\no\n\n(0)\n\nThe particle sets of Type II for \u03a6k are arbitrary totally neutral collections of particles with\n(\u2212\u2212)\ntotal values B = 0, Li = 0, Q = 0. For the case of \u03a6k\nthe particle sets of Type II must\ncontain two pairs of anti-up and down quarks of any generation to provide Q = \u22122. They may\nbe accompanied with any neutral set of particles of the previous case. It is implied that the\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\nquarks in \u03a6k and \u03a6k\nare arranged in color singlet combinations forming mesons and/or\nbaryons.\nWe write down the effective Lagrangians describing the LFV and LFNV processes in the\nfollowing schematic form:\nLLF V\nLLF NV\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n= \u03a6k *  \u0304li \u0393(k)ij lj + \u03a6k * W\u03bc\u2212 Sk\u03bc\u03bd W\u03bd+ + L\u0303 + h.c.,\n(\u2212\u2212)  \u0304 \u2032\n(\u2212\u2212)\n= \u03a6\n* li \u0393\nlc + \u03a6\n* W + S \u2032\u03bc\u03bd W + + L\u0303\u2032 + h.c..\nk\n\n(k)ij j\n\nk\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\nk\n\n\u03bd\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\f(0)\n\nThe first effective operators in Eqs. (3) and (4) generate the amplitudes of LFV \u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212\n(\u2212\u2212)\nand LFNV \u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 processes, respectively, and may receive contributions from the SM\ninteractions via neutrino exchange as well as from some physics beyond the SM. The vertex\nstructure \u0393(k) depends on the concrete realization of this operator. We also included two more\nterms in both Lagrangians (3) and (4). The terms L\u0303 and L\u0303\u2032 denote SM and any beyond the\nSM interactions whose explicit form is irrelevant for our analysis. We only state their possible\npresence. The second operators in Eqs. (3) and (4) play a key role in our analysis and are\nalways induced by the SM interactions. This is guaranteed by the structure of the field sets\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\u03a6k and \u03a6k\ngiven in Eqs. (1), (3). The particular realization of these operators depends on\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\nthe field sets \u03a6k , \u03a6k\nand determines the vertex structures Sk and Sk\u2032 . The specific form\nof \u0393(k) , \u0393\u2032(k) and Sk , Sk\u2032 is irrelevant for our subsequent reasoning. In what follows we denote\nthe first and second type of the effective operators in Eqs. (3), (4) by \u0393\u0302(k)ij , \u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij and \u015ck , \u015c \u2032 k ,\nrespectively.\nFirst, we observe that the operator \u0393\u0302(k)ij (\u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij ) not only contributes to the amplitude\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\nof the corresponding LFV \u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 (LFNV \u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 ) process but also to any other\n+ \u2212\n(\u2212\u2212)\nLFV \u03a6(0)\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 ) process with n 6= k via the SM operators \u015ck,n (\u015c \u2032 k,n )\nn \u2192 li lj (LFNV \u03a6n\nas shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, we can write down the following schematic formulas for the\namplitudes of the two different LFV processes\n(0)\n\n\u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 :\n(0)\n\u03a6n6=k\n\n\u2192 li+ lj\u2212 :\n\nA(k)ij = h\u0393\u0302(k)ij i + h\u015ck \u015cn \u0393\u0302(n)ij i + \u00c3(k)ij ,\n\n(5)\n\nA(n)ij = h\u0393\u0302(n)ij i + h\u015cn \u015ck \u0393\u0302(k)ij i + \u00c3(n)ij ,\n\n(6)\n\nand also for the two different LFNV processes\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 :\n\nA\u2032(k)ij = h\u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij i + h\u015c \u2032 k \u015c \u2032 n \u0393\u0302\u2032 (n)ij i + \u00c3\u2032 (k)ij ,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03a6n6=k \u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 :\n\nA\u2032(n)ij = h\u0393\u0302\u2032 (n)ij i + h\u015c \u2032 n \u015c \u2032 k \u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij i + \u00c3\u2032 (n)ij ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03a6k\n\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\nwhere the objects between h...i schematically represent the contributions of the diagrams in\nFig. 1 to the matrix elements of these processes. The last terms in Eqs. (5)-(8) denote any\nother contributions including those which originate from physics beyond the SM. From the\npresence of the second next-to-leading terms in the above relations one may conclude that\nif the process \u03a6k \u2192 li lj occurs at certain rate then the process \u03a6n \u2192 li lj should be also\nexpected to occur at some non-zero rate and visa versa. Obviously, their rates may differ\nsignificantly. One may expect that the natural suppression of one process with respect to\nanother be attributed to the difference in their kinematics, phase space and, when the first\nterm is eventually absent, also to the SM couplings involved in the second terms in Eqs. (5)(8). Going further, one may also admit the possibility of a strong accidental cancellation\n3\n\n\fbetween the three terms in the amplitudes of some processes. This could lead to an additional\na priori unlimited suppression of these processes with respect to the other ones. An extreme\ncase of this type of suppression corresponds to the vanishing of the amplitudes of some subset\nof the processes A(\u03a6k \u2192 li lj ) = 0, while A(\u03a6n6=k \u2192 li lj ) 6= 0. This sort of suppression\nis unnatural, since the above mentioned cancellation is, in general, unstable with respect to\nradiative corrections. The only stabilizer of such a cancellation is certain symmetry present\nin the theory which protects A(\u03a6k \u2192 li lj ) = 0 from radiative corrections to all orders. An\nadequate framework for the analysis of the situation with hierarchical values of the above\namplitudes is given by the well known 't Hooft naturalness rule [3] which, for the case of a\nhierarchy of two observables A1 /A2 \u226a 1, requires the presence of a \"custodial symmetry\"\nin the limit A1 /A2 = 0. In order to study the possibility of hierarchy of the amplitudes of\nthe LFV and LFNV processes we examine whether there exists the corresponding symmetry\nin the case of the Lagrangians (3) and (4) including both the SM and arbitrary beyond the\nSM interactions. This symmetry is associated with the unitary transformations of the fields\nrealizing representations of a global group, which we denote by G\u03b7 . Let the fields transform as\nG\u03b7\n\nG\u03b7\n\nG\u03b7\n\nG\u03b7\n\n\u2020\nW \u2212 \u2212\u2192 \u03b7W * W \u2212 , W + \u2212\u2192 \u03b7W\n* W + , li \u2212\u2192 \u03b7li * li ,\n\n\u03a6k \u2212\u2192 \u03b7k * \u03a6k ,\n\nG\u03b7\n\n\u03a6\u2032k \u2212\u2192 \u03b7k\u2032 * \u03a6\u2032k ,\n\n(9)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u03b7a * \u03b7a\u2020 = 1. The effective operators \u0393\u0302(k)ij and \u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij , generating the \u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 and\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 processes, transform as\nG\u03b7\n\n\u0393\u0302(k)ij \u2212\u2192 \u03b7(k)ij * \u0393\u0302(k)ij ,\nG\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n* \u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij ,\n\u0393\u0302\u2032 (k)ij \u2212\u2192 \u03b7(k)ij\n\nwith \u03b7(k)ij = \u03b7li\u2020 * \u03b7lj * \u03b7k ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u2032\nwith \u03b7(k)ij\n= \u03b7li\u2020 * \u03b7lj\u2020 * \u03b7k\u2032\n\n(11)\n\nThe group G\u03b7 is not arbitrary and should be at least consistent with the SM part of the\nLagrangians (3) and (4), represented by the operators \u015ck and \u015c \u2032 k . Their invariance with\nrespect to G\u03b7 requires:\n\u03b7k = 1,\n\n\u2020 2 \u2032\n(\u03b7W\n) \u03b7k = 1,\n\n(12)\n\n\u00bfFrom these constraints it follows that\n\u03b7(k)ij = \u03b7(n)ij ,\n(0)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b7(k)ij\n= \u03b7(n)ij\n\n(\u2212\u2212)\n\nfor \u2200 k, n .\n\n(13)\n\n\u2032\nThe process \u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 (\u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 ) is allowed by G\u03b7 if \u03b7(k)ij = 1 (\u03b7(k)ij\n= 1) and forbidden\n\u2032\nif \u03b7(k)ij 6= 1 (\u03b7(k)ij 6= 1). From (13) it follows that if just one of the processes \u03a6k \u2192 li lj is allowed\nthen all the ones with the same external leptons \u03a6n6=k \u2192 li lj are allowed and visa versa, and if at\n\n4\n\n\fleast one of them is forbidden by G\u03b7 all of them are also forbidden1 . Thus, we conclude that the\n\"custodial symmetry\" protecting a hierarchy of amplitudes of the LFV (LFNV) processes with\nthe same lepton flavor structure cannot be introduced in a realistic theory. Therefore, a priori,\none may expect them to be of comparable order of magnitude. Obviously, this conclusion\ndoes not take into account kinematics and hadronic structure factors which may result in a\nsignificant, but theoretically controllable, difference between the rates of different processes.\nAs we already pointed out the above result is valid in the presence of any physics beyond\n(0)\n(\u2212\u2212)\nthe SM. It is valid not only for LFV (LFNV) processes of the type \u03a6k \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 (\u03a6k\n\u2192 li\u2212 lj\u2212 )\nbut for any process with arbitrary configurations of final and initial states like \u03a6k1 \u2192 \u03a6k2 li+ lj\u2212\n(\u03a6\u2032k1 \u2192 \u03a6\u2032k2 li\u2212 lj\u2212 ), \u03a6k1 li\u2212 \u2192 \u03a6k2 lj\u2212 (\u03a6\u2032k1 li+ \u2192 \u03a6\u2032k2 lj\u2212 ). This is because our arguments are based\non the analysis of the effective operators \u0393\u0302(k)ij , which generate all these processes. The most\ntypical examples of them are: meson decays, M 0 \u2192 li+ lj\u2212 , M1+ \u2192 M2\u2212 li+ lj+ ; neutrinoless nuclear\ndouble beta decay, (A, Z) \u2192 (A, Z + 2)li\u2212 lj\u2212 ; muon nuclear conversion, \u03bc\u2212 (A, Z) \u2192 e\u2212 (A, Z);\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, etc.\nLet us illustrate the above general conclusion by considering the concrete case of the\ntwo processes: (a) \u03c0 0 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 and (b) W + W \u2212 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 . They may receive contributions\nfrom the effective operators of a different high scale origin. In particular, the operators\nO (6) = (q\u0304\u03b35 q *  \u0304l1 \u03b35 l2 )/\u039b2 and O (5) = (W\u03bc+ W\u03bd\u2212 *  \u0304l1 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd l2 )/\u039b, corresponding to the dominant\ntree level contributions to (a) and (b) processes, respectively, have different physical dimensions, dim=6 and dim=5, and originate from different underlying renormalizable interactions\nafter the integrating out different heavy states. For this reason the rates of the two processes\nmay look totally unrelated and the situation when one process is strongly suppressed with\nrespect to the other does not seem theoretically inconsistent. However, at loop level there\nare cross contributions of O (6) and O (5) operators: O (6) contributes to \u03c0 0 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 and O (5) to\nW + W \u2212 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 in the way shown in Fig. 1. Now again one can imagine the situation when\nin certain underlying model the common contribution of both operators at tree and loop levels\n(including the possible contributions of some other operators) to one of these processes, say\nto the process (a), is, due to self-cancellation, strongly suppressed or even vanishes resulting\nin zero amplitude of (a), while this does not happen in process (b), leaving its amplitude at\na sizable level. The general conclusion made in the present paper excludes such a situation\nand requires that if one of these processes occurs with some non-zero amplitude then the other\nalso has a non-zero amplitude. Moreover, any hierarchy in the magnitude of these amplitudes,\nA(\u03c0 0 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 ) \u226b A(W + W \u2212 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 ) or A(\u03c0 0 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 ) \u226a A(W + W \u2212 \u2192 l1+ l2\u2212 ), is shown to be\nunnatural. Of course, the notion of naturalness is, as always, understood as a comparability in\norder of magnitude.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the 't Hooft naturalness rule [3] implies that different\n1\n\nSimilar idea was used in Refs. [4, 5] to prove one-to-one correspondence between the amplitude of neutrinoless double beta decay, Majorana neutrino [4] and sneutrino [5] masses.\n\n5\n\n\fLFV(LFNV) processes with the same external leptons all have comparable amplitudes modulo their kinematics and form factors of the participating hadrons. This model independent\nconclusion is valid in the presence of any physics beyond the Standard Model and should be\nhelpful for the theoretical evaluation of the observability of the LFV processes in the future\nexperiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the FONDECYT projects 1030244, 1030355\n\nReferences\n[1] Review of Particle Physics, S.
