The characteristic length scale l at which nonclassical features of p\ngravity should emerge may be the\nPlanck length lP = ~ G/c3 \u223c 1.6 * 10\u221235 m, or it may\nbe significantly larger [7].\nOne way to introduce such noncommutativity is algebraic. A few years ago, Vilela Mendes [8] argued again for\nconsideration of the combined Heisenberg and Poincar\u00e9\nLie algebras as a kinematical algebra for relativistic quantum mechanics. This structure is \"unstable\", but allows\na parameterized family of nontrivial deformations that\nare \"stable\"-in the sense that all the Lie algebras in an\nopen neighborhood in the space of structure constants\nare mutually isomorphic [9, 10, 11, 12]. The nontrivial\nsecond cohomology of the original Lie algebra is a nec-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: gagoldin@dimacs.rutgers.edu\naddress: sarben.sarkar@kcl.ac.uk\n\nessary condition for it to be deformable [13]. The proposed stable algebra for relativistic quantum mechanics\nis a deformation by two parameters l and R, which are\nfundamental lengths. Taking l \u2192 0 and R \u2192 \u221e leads\nto recovery of the original Lie algebra. Vilela Mendes\nargues on fundamental grounds for describing the physical world by means of a stable Lie algebra, so that small\nchanges in physical constants do not fundamentally alter\nthe structure. We take no position here on this question,\nbut explore some interesting consequences of the Vilela\nMendes approach. A recent, beautiful paper of Chryssomalakos and Okon describes and discusses the full set of\npossible stable deformations of the Heisenberg-Poincar\u00e9\nalgebra, with explanation of the relevant cohomology theory and detailed references [14].\nThe present article is motivated by the problem of\ndefining an equal-time, local current algebra compatible\nwith the nonrelativistic quantum kinematics that follows\nfrom Vilela Mendes' proposal. Like him we consider the\ncase where R \u2192 \u221e but l 6= 0; then the space-time coordinate operators no longer commute. We clarify the\nrelation of the irreducible representations of a deformed\nsubalgebra to those of the limiting Heisenberg algebra,\nconcentrating on the case of one space dimension (although our considerations generalize straightforwardly to\nhigher dimensions). The limit procedure here goes back\nto a 1970 scheme of Barut and Bohm for reduction of\ncertain representations of SO(4, 2) [15]. But our construction of the generalized kinetic energy and harmonic\noscillator Hamiltonians in this framework leads to an an-\n\n\f2\nswer different from that suggested by Vilela Mendes.\nOne way of obtaining local currents for the deformed\nalgebra is to extend the usual nonrelativistic local current\nalgebra (LCA) of scalar functions and vector fields, and\nthe corresponding infinite-dimensional groups of scalar\nfunctions and diffeomorphisms. In doing this we make\nuse of an abstract single-particle configuration space,\nwhich is a commutative spatial manifold having one dimension more than the configuration space for the limiting situation with l \u2192 0. Thus the deformed (1 + 1)dimensional theory entails self-adjoint representations of\nan infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of nonrelativistic, local currents for a (2+1)-dimensional space-time (LCA2).\nTo be able to recover the usual current algebra (LCA1)\nin the limit l \u2192 0, one may introduce a semidirect sum\nof LCA2 with the algebra of vector fields of the line.\nThe local operators then act in a direct integral of irreducible representations of the global, finite-dimensional\ndeformed Lie algebra. This seems to open up interesting\nnew possibilities, which we discuss briefly.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present\nthe necessary background-the (l, R)-deformed Lie algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics, the nonrelativistic local current algebra and its relation to Heisenberg\nalgebra, and the desirable properties for local currents in\nrelation to the deformed algebra with l 6= 0. In Sec. III,\nwe review several different, but unitarily equivalent, selfadjoint representations of the l-deformed Heisenberg algebra for the case of one spatial dimension-which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the group of rigid motions of\nthe plane. This subalgebra for the one-dimensional problem serves as a useful laboratory. We write explicitly the\nunitary operators intertwining the representations. This\npermits clarification of how an irreducible representation\nof the usual Heisenberg algebra can be recovered in the\nl \u2192 0 limit. In Sec. IV, we discuss the kinetic energy and\nharmonic oscillator Hamiltonians. In Sec. V, we consider\nfirst the problems associated with currents localized with\nrespect to the spectrum of the deformed position operator. Then we develop and discuss the extended nonrelativistic local current algebra and diffeomorphism group.\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIntroducing the 4-vectors q\u03bc and p\u03bd , \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3, and\nthe Lorentz generators M\u03bc\u03bd , one combines the canonical\nbrackets,\n[ p\u03bc , q\u03bd ] = i ~ \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd J ,\n(1)\n[ q\u03bc , q\u03bd ] = [p\u03bc , p\u03bd ] = [ q\u03bc , J ] = [ p\u03bc , J ] = 0 ,\nwith the Lorentz brackets,\n[M\u03bc\u03bd , M\u03c1\u03c3 ] =\ni(M\u03bc\u03c3 \u03b7\u03bd\u03c1 + M\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b7\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212 M\u03bd\u03c3 \u03b7\u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 M\u03bc\u03c1 \u03b7\u03bd\u03c3 ),\nby means of the additional brackets,\n[M\u03bc\u03bd , p\u03bb ] = i (p\u03bc \u03b7\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 p\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc\u03bb ) ,\n\n(2)\n\n[M\u03bc\u03bd , q\u03bb ] = i (q\u03bc \u03b7\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 q\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc\u03bb ) ,\n[M\u03bc\u03bd , J ] = 0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag [1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121] in units with c = 1.\nTo describe the quantum kinematics of a particle, one\ntypically represents a subalgebra of this Lie algebra by\nself-adjoint operators in Hilbert space.\nWhile the Lie algebras of Eqs. (1) and Eqs. (2) are\nseparately stable, the combined Lie algebra of Eqs. (1)(3) is not; so we consider a stable deformation.\nA.\n\nDeformed Lie algebras for quantum mechanics\n\nThe relevant deformation is labeled by fundamental\nlengths R and l, and satisfies brackets where Eqs. (2)\nand (3) are unchanged, but Eqs. (1) are replaced by,\n[ p\u03bc , q\u03bd ] = i ~ \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd J\n\n[ q\u03bc , q\u03bd ] = \u2212i\u03b5 l 2 M\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u03b5 \u2032~ 2\nM\u03bc\u03bd ,\nR2\nl2\n[ q\u03bc , J ] = i\u03b5 p\u03bc ,\n~\n\u03b5 \u2032~\n[ p\u03bc , J ] = \u2212i 2 q\u03bc ,\nR\n[ p\u03bc , p\u03bd ] = \u2212i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b5 and \u03b5\u2032 are \u00b11. Evidently as l \u2192 0 and R \u2192 \u221e,\nwe recover Eqs. (1)-(3).\nThis Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the\northogonal group in six dimensions, with metric \u03b7ab =\ndiag [1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u03b5 \u2032 , \u03b5 ]. Evidently in a self-adjoint\nrepresentation, the q\u03bc no longer commute with each\nother. Their interpretation as space-time coordinate operators in such a representation may be questioned [14];\nbut if we maintain this interpretation, Heisenberg-like\nuncertainty relations for these coordinates suggest that\nspace-time becomes \"fuzzy\" to order l [16].\nWe remark that in other specific models, the noncommutativity of the coordinate operators is different. For\nexample, in the case of a charged particle moving in a\nplane perpendicular to a magnetic field of magnitude B,\nin the limit as the mass m \u2192 0 we expect, for j, k = 1, 2,\n[ qj , qk ] = i \u03b8jk J ,\n\n[ qj , J ] = 0 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a constant antisymmetric matrix inversely proportional to B. A similar bracket occurs for a bosonic\nstring when there is a background, constant NeveuSchwarz 2-form in the world volume of a D-brane [17, 18].\nAs the parameter l is relevant locally, we shall follow\nVilela Mendes in focusing on the algebra obtained by\ntaking R \u2192 \u221e. Then the brackets involving R in Eqs.\n(4) become zero. We now want to concentrate on selfadjoint representations of the Heisenberg-like subalgebra,\nwith j, k = 1, 2, 3, and with \u03b5 = \u22121, given by the spatial\ncomponents of Eqs. (2)-(3), together with the brackets,\n[ qj , qk ] = i l2 Mjk ,\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c1 (f ) \u03a8(x) = mf (x)\u03a8(x) ,\n(11)\n~\nJ (g) \u03a8(x) =\n{ g (x) * \u2207\u03a8(x) + \u2207 * [g (x) \u03a8(x)]} ,\n2i\n\nset B \u2286 Rd , the expectation value (\u03a8, \u03c1 (f ) \u03a8) with respect\nwave function \u03a8 approximates\nR to the single-particle\n2\nm \u03c7B (x) |\u03c8 (x)| dx, which is the mass times the usual\nprobability for finding the particle in the region B. If\nf (x) approaches \u03b4 (x \u2212 x0 ) for a fixed point x0 \u2208 Rd ,\n2\nthen (\u03a8, \u03c1 (f ) \u03a8) approaches m |\u03a8 (x0 )| . We also see\nhow the Heisenberg algebra is recovered-if f (x) approximates the coordinate function xj , then \u03c1(f ) approximates the moment operator mqj acting in L2dx (Rd ) via\nmultiplication by mxj . Similarly, if g(x) is taken to approximate a constant vector field in the j-direction, so\nthat (let us say) gj (x) \u223c 1 with gk (x) = 0 for k 6= j,\nthen J (g) \u223c \u2212i~\u2202/\u2202xj , which is the action of the momentum operator pj in L2dx(Rd ).\nIn short, the LCA in the 1-particle representation, with\nsuitable (global) choices of test functions, allows recovery\nof the usual quantum-mechanical representation of the\nfinite-dimensional subalgebra of Eqs. (1) having spatial\nindices. Likewise, generators of spatial rotations may be\nrecovered-e.g., in the 1-particle representation in three\nspace dimensions, the operator for orbital angular momentum about the x3 -axis is approximated by choosing\ng1 (x) = \u2212x2 , g2 (x) = x1 , and g3 (x) = 0 inside a large\ncompact region |x| \u2264 R; outside this region, g (x) falls\nsmoothly to 0. Then J (g) approximates the operator\n~M12 = L3 = (q \u00d7 p) * e3 acting in L2dx (R3 ), where e3 is\nthe unit vector in the x3 -direction.\nThe study of inequivalent, self-adjoint representations\nof this infinite-dimensional algebra has turned out to be\na powerful method for classifying, and in some cases predicting, kinematical possibilities for quantum systems.\nThese possibilities include the usual N -particle representations, N = 1, 2, 3, . . ., satisfying bosonic or fermionic\nstatistics for N \u2265 2 in more than one space dimension. They also include particle systems obeying anyonic\nstatistics in two-dimensional space [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]\nor other exotic statistics, particles with spin [26, 27],\ncomposite systems having dipole or higher multipole moments [28], and infinite-particle or extended systems having infinite-dimensional configuration spaces [29, 30, 31].\nThis is our motivation for investigating the possibilities\nfor defining local currents appropriate to the deformed\nLie algebra of Eqs. (6). The goal is to obtain an infinitedimensional, local Lie algebra that is a deformation or\nextension of the LCA of Eqs. (10), which, with suitable\nchoices of test functions in a 1-particle representation,\nallows recovery of a standard representation of Eqs. (6).\nThen the unitarily inequivalent representations of the deformed LCA should describe kinematical possibilities for\na nonrelativistic version of the deformed quantum theory.\nThus in Sec. III, we shall discuss some different ways of\nwriting standard representations of Eqs. (10).\nNote that we may introduce an\u0001 operator-valued distribution Q(f, g) acting in L2dx Rd , defined by\n\nwhere m is the particle mass. Now as the test function\nf (x) approaches an indicator function \u03c7B (x) for a Borel\n\n(12)\n\n[ qj , pk ] = i\u03b4jk ~J ,\nl2\npj ,\n~\n[ pj , pk ] = [ pj , J ] = 0 .\n[ qj , J ] = \u2212i\n\n(6)\n\nThe Lie algebra of Eqs. (2)-(3) and (6) represents the\nglobal symmetry of the deformed quantum theory. We\ndesire, however, to incorporate a description of local symmetry, for which we turn to local current algebra.\nB.\n\nEqual-time local current algebra\n\nIn standard, nonrelativistic quantum theory, the\nsecond-quantized field \u03c8b (x, t) and its adjoint \u03c8b\u2217 (x, t),\nfor x \u2208 Rd , are operator-valued distributions in Fock\nspace. These satisfy the equal-time canonical commutation (\u2212) or anticommutation (+) relations,\ni\nh\n= \u03b4(x \u2212 y) ;\n(7)\n\u03c8b (x) , \u03c8b\u2217 (y)\n\u00b1 (fixed t)\n\nthe argument t is henceforth suppressed. Then the local, fixed-time mass density \u03c1 (x) and momentum density\nJ (x) are operator-valued distributions, defined formally\nby\n\u03c1 (x) = m\u03c8b\u2217 (x) \u03c8b (x) ,\nh\ni\no\n~ n b\u2217\n\u03c8 (x) \u2207\u03c8b (x) \u2212 \u2207\u03c8b\u2217 (x) \u03c8b (x) . (8)\nJ (x) =\n2i\n\nThese obey a certain singular Lie algebra, which is independent of whether the original field is bosonic or\nfermionic [19]. Define\nZ\n\u03c1 (f ) =\n\u03c1 (x) f (x) dx ,\nJ (g) =\n\nZ X\nd\n\nJk (x) gk (x) dx ,\n\n(9)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere f and the components gk of g are compactlysupported C \u221e test functions on Rd . Then one obtains\nthe local current algebra [20],\n[\u03c1 (f1 ) , \u03c1 (f2 )] = 0 ,\n[\u03c1 (f ) , J (g)] = i~\u03c1 (g * \u2207f ) ,\n[J (g1 ) , J (g2 )] = \u2212i~J ([g1 , g2 ]) ;\n\n(10)\n\nwhere [ g1 , g2 ] = g1 * \u2207g2 \u2212 g2 * \u2207g1 is the usual Lie\nbracket of vector fields.\n\u0001\nIn the 1-particle Hilbert space L2dx Rd , we have the\nself-adjoint representation\n\nQ(f, g)\u03a8 = f (x)\u03a8 +\n1\n{ g (x) * \u2207\u03a8(x) + \u2207 * [g (x) \u03a8(x)]} .\n2i\n\n\f4\nThen Q is a self-adjoint representation of the natural semidirect sum of the commutative Lie algebra of\ncompactly-supported, real-valued C \u221e functions f on Rd ,\nwith the Lie algebra of vector fields g on Rd ; namely,\n[(f1 , g1 ), (f2 , g2 )] = (g2 *\u2207f1 \u2212g1 *\u2207f2 , \u2212[g1 , g2 ]) . (13)\nThe physical constants m and ~ do not enter (12), but\nEqs. (11) follow from it when we set \u03c1(f ) = m Q(f, 0)\nand J(g) = ~ Q(0, g).\nThe group that is associated with Eq. (13) is the natural semidirect product D(Rd )\u00d7Diff c (Rd ), where D(Rd ) is\nthe group of compactly supported, real-valued C \u221e functions on Rd under pointwise addition, and Diff c (Rd ) is\nthe group of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of Rd\nunder composition [31]. These groups are endowed with\nthe topology of uniform convergence in all derivatives on\ncompact sets. The group law, for f1 , f2 \u2208 D(Rd ) and\n\u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2208 Diff c (Rd ), is\n(f1 , \u03c61 ) (f2 , \u03c62 ) = (f1 + f2 \u25e6 \u03c61 , \u03c62 \u25e6 \u03c61 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u25e6 denotes composition.\nGiven the compactly-supported, C \u221e vector field g on\nd\nR , there exists a unique, one-parameter group of C \u221e\ndiffeomorphisms \u03c6ag (x), a \u2208 R, such that\n\u2202\u03c6ag (x)\n= g(\u03c6ag (x)) ,\n\u2202a\n\n(15)\n\ng\nwith the initial condition \u03c6a=0\n(x) \u2261 x. In a continuous,\nunitary representation U (f )V (\u03c6) of D(Rd )\u00d7Diff c (Rd ),\nthe local currents are the self-adjoint generators of 1parameter unitary subgroups; so that\n\nU (f ) = exp [ (i/m) \u03c1 (f )] = exp [ iQ(f, 0)] ,\nV (\u03c6sg ) = exp [ (is/~) J (g)] = exp [ iQ(0, g) ] . (16)\nThe method of induced representations, and other techniques of unitary group representation, have been extensively used in the study of the local current algebra.\nIII.\n\nSOME UNITARILY EQUIVALENT\nREPRESENTATIONS\n\nLet us now turn to some representations of the spatial\ncomponents of Eqs. (2)-(3), taken together with Eqs. (6).\nIn d space dimensions, there is a natural representation\nby derivations over the (commutative) manifold Rd+1 ,\nwith global coordinates (x1 , x2 , . . . , xd , w). Labeling this\nrepresentation with the superscript (1), it is given by [8]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(1)\nqj = il w\n\u2212 xj\n,\n\u2202xj\n\u2202w\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(1)\n,\n(17)\n\u2212 xk\nMjk = \u2212i xj\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xj\n\u2202\n,\nJ (1) = \u2212il\n\u2202w\n\u2202\n(1)\n.\npj = \u2212i~\n\u2202xj\n\nThe algebra is represented here by the generators of rigid\nmotions of Rd+1 , i.e., the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean\ngroup Ed+1 which is a semidirect product of the translations and rotation groups. Note that the coordinate w is\nlike a hidden dimension in Kaluza-Klein theory [32]; its\npresence here illustrates the idea that sometimes noncommutative structures can serve as alternatives to hidden\ndimensions. The Hilbert space on which the differential\noperators of Eqs. (17) act as self-adjoint operators is the\nspace H = L2dxdw , consisting of complex-valued functions\n\u03a6 on Rd+1 that are square-integrable with respect to the\nQ\nLebesgue measure ( dj=1 dxj ) dw.\nBut the representation of Eqs. (17) has the drawback\nthat when we take the limit as l \u2192 0, we do not recover the usual representation of the Heisenberg algebra\n(1)\nwithout deformation; rather qj and J (1) both tend formally to 0. We therefore consider an alternative, denoted\nwith the superscript (2), obtained by introducing a unitary multiplication operator Ul in the Hilbert space H.\nDefining Ul \u03a6(x, w) = exp[\u2212iw/l ] \u03a6(x, w), we set\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(qj , Mjk , J (2) , pj ) = Ul (qj , Mjk , J (1) , pj ) Ul\u22121 ;\n(18)\nthen we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(2)\nqj = xj + il w\n,\n\u2212 xj\n\u2202xj\n\u2202w\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(2)\n,\n(19)\n\u2212 xk\nMjk = \u2212i xj\n\u2202xk\n\u2202xj\n\u2202\n,\nJ (2) = I \u2212 il\n\u2202w\n\u2202\n(2)\n.\npj = \u2212i~\n\u2202xj\nNow the operators smoothly go over to the standard\nHeisenberg representation as l \u2192 0. This representation\nis also given in [8].\nLet us introduce two corresponding unitarily equivalent representations obtained by Fourier transformation.\nAs usual, we have the unitary operator\nb = L2dk dk ,\nF : H = L2dxdw \u2192 H\nx\nw\n\ngiven by\n\nb (k1 , . . . , kd , kw ) =\n[F \u03a6] (k1 , . . . , kd , kw ) = \u03a6\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0013d+1 Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n***\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndx1 * * * dxd dw *\n\n(20)\n\n* \u03a6 (x, w) exp [\u2212ix * kx \u2212 ikw w ] ,\nwhere kx = (k1 , . . . , kd ) and kw are the Fourier conjugate\nvariables to x and w respectively. Then setting\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nc , Jb(1) , pb ) = F (q , M , J (1) , p ) F \u22121 ,\n(b\nqj , M\nj\nj\nj\njk\njk\n\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2)\n(2) c (2) b(2)\n, pbj ) = F (qi , Mij , J (2) , pi ) F \u22121 ,\n(b\nqj , M\njk , J\n\n(21)\n\n\f5\nwe have\n(1)\n\nqbj\n\nc (1)\nM\njk\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u2212 kj\n= il kw\n\u2202kj\n\u2202kw\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u2212 kk\n= \u2212i kj\n\u2202kk\n\u2202kj\n\n(22)\n\nJb(1) = lkw ,\n(1)\n\npbj\n\nwhile\n\n(2)\n\nqbj\n\nc (2)\nM\njk\n\n= ~kj ,\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n+ il kw\n\u2212 kj\n\u2202kj\n\u2202kj\n\u2202kw\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 kk\n,\n= \u2212i kj\n\u2202kk\n\u2202kj\n\n= i\n\n(23)\n\nJb(2) = I + lkw ,\n(2)\n\npbj\n\n= ~kj ,\n\nso that in Eqs. (23), as in Eqs. (19), a representation of\nthe Heisenberg algebra survives in the l \u2192 0 limit. Of\ncourse the spectra of the self-adjoint operators representing the generators of the deformed algebra are the same\nacross all unitarily equivalent representations.\nWe focus now for simplicity on the case d = 1, which\nillustrates well the issues discussed in this article. Because the effective spatial dimension for the local current\nalgebra will be d + 1, there is also the interesting possibility for d = 1 that features of anyonic statistics of\npoint particles in two-space could occur. We return to\nthis point in the discussion below.\nFor d = 1, the algebra of Eqs. (6) reduces to\n[ q, p ] = i~ J ,\nl2\n[ q, J ] = \u2212i p ,\n~\n[ p, J ] = 0 .\n\n(24)\n\nIn the representation of Eqs. (22), it is useful to introduce\npolar coordinates (\u03c1, \u03c8), with kx = k1 = \u03c1 sin \u03c8, kw =\n\u03c1 cos \u03c8, and dkx dkw = \u03c1 d\u03c1 d\u03c8. Then the operators become\nqb(1) = il\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u03c8\n\npb (1) = ~\u03c1 sin \u03c8 ,\nJb(1) = l\u03c1 cos \u03c8 .\n\n(25)\n\nb is obviously reThe representation by Eqs. (25) in H\nducible, since the subspace of momentum-space wave\nb with support between \u03c10 and \u03c10 + \u2206\u03c1 is infunctions \u03a6\nvariant under these operators. Indeed, the Casimir operator\nC =\n\n1 2\n1\np + 2 J2\n~2\nl\n\n(26)\n\ncommutes with all of the generators in Eqs. (24). The\nb defined from Eqs. (25) acts in\ncorresponding operator C\n\nb via multiplication by \u03c1 2 . The eigenvalues \u03c1 2 of C\nH\n0\nlabel unitarily inequivalent irreducible representations of\n(24); and we see that the reducible representation given\nb is actually a direct integral\nby Eqs. (25) acting in H\n(from \u03c10 = 0 to +\u221e) of irreducible representations. The\nirreducible component associated with the eigenvalue \u03c102\nb\u03c10\nconsists of operators acting on the Hilbert space H\nb \u03c10 (\u03c8) on the circle of raof complex-valued functions \u03a6\ndius \u03c10 centered at the origin in (kx , kw )-space, that are\nsquare-integrable with respect to the measure d\u03c8.\n(1)\nLet us denote by qb\u03c10 the self-adjoint operator il \u2202/\u2202\u03c8\nb\u03c10 (defined on a domain of essential selfacting in H\nadjointness that includes the everywhere essentially con(1)\n(1)\ntinuous and differentiable functions). Let pb\u03c10 and Jb\u03c10\nbe, respectively, the multiplication operators ~\u03c10 sin \u03c8\nb\u03c10 . Then a complete orthogand l\u03c10 cos \u03c8 acting in H\nb\u03c10 is provided by the eigenfunctions of\nonal basis for H\n(1)\n\u2212in\u03c8\nb \u03c1(n)\n: n \u2208 Z}, which may\nqb\u03c10 , specifically {\u03a6\n0 (\u03c8) = e\nbe regarded as infinitely differentiable functions on the\n(1)\ncircle of radius \u03c1 = \u03c10 . Thus qb\u03c10 has the eigenvalue spectrum {nl : n \u2208 Z}, and the positional spectrum (which is\ninvariant under unitary equivalence) is discrete and unbounded in an irreducible self-adjoint representation of\nthe deformed algebra. On the other hand, the spectra of\n(1)\n(1)\npb\u03c10 and Jb\u03c10 are continuous and bounded in absolute\nvalue by ~\u03c10 and l\u03c10 respectively in such an irreducible\nrepresentation.\nNote that the complex-valued functions on the plane\nb (n) (\u03c1, \u03c8) = e\u2212in\u03c8 , n \u2208 Z, do not belong to H\nb\ngiven by \u03a6\nas they are not square-integrable with respect to \u03c1 d\u03c1 d\u03c8.\nThese are \"non-normalizable\" eigenfunctions of the operator qb(1) of Eq. (25). Bona fide square-integrable eigenb take the form f (\u03c1) e\u2212in\u03c8 , where\nfunctions\nof qb(1) in H\nR\n2\n|f (\u03c1)| \u03c1 d\u03c1 is finite. One regards the operator qb(1) as\nthe direct integral over \u03c1 of the measurable field of oper(1)\nators qb\u03c1 and the corresponding direct integral structure\nof the Hilbert space is given by\nZ \u221e\nb\nb\u03c1 \u03c1 d\u03c1.\nH=\nH\n(27)\n0\n\nNow, in the representations of Eqs. (24) given by Eqs.\n(17) or Eqs. (19) acting in H, we have corresponding decompositions into direct integrals of irreducible\nrepresentations over the parameter \u03c1 [33]. The irreducible representations act in Hilbert spaces H\u03c1 , and\nthe operator q (1) [respectively, q (2) ] is the direct inte(1)\n(2)\ngral over \u03c1 of operators q\u03c1 [respectively, q\u03c1 ] that\nact in H\u03c1 . Let us introduce polar coordinates (r, \u03b8),\nwith x = r sin \u03b8 and w = r cos \u03b8. Then the correspond(1)\ning eigenfunctions of the operator q\u03c10 , with eigenvalues nl, in an irreducible representation labeled by \u03c10 ,\n(n)\nare the functions {\u03a6\u03c10 (r, \u03b8) = e in\u03b8 : n \u2208 Z}. The\n(2)\ncorresponding eigenfunctions of the operator q\u03c10 are\nin\u03b8 \u2212i(r/l) cos \u03b8\n{e e\n: n \u2208 Z}. The associated decomposition of H as a direct integral of H\u03c1 with respect to\n\n\f6\n\u03c1 d\u03c1, is developed in [33] using the Fourier-Bessel transformation. For anyR element \u03a6 (x, w) of H, we have\n\u221e\n\u03a6(r sin \u03b8, r cos \u03b8) = 0 \u03a6\u03c1 (r sin \u03b8, r cos \u03b8)\u03c1 d\u03c1, where\n\u03a6\u03c1 (r sin \u03b8, r cos \u03b8) = (2\u03c0)\u22121\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nr\u2032 dr\u2032 \u00d7\n\n(28)\n\nh p\ni\n\u03a6 (r\u2032 sin \u03b8\u2032 , r\u2032 cos \u03b8\u2032 ) J0 \u03c1 r2 + (r\u2032 )2 \u2212 2rr\u2032 cos (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) .\n\nFinally we can explore the rather subtle way that\nthe usual, irreducible representation of the Heisenberg\nalgebra must be recovered from irreducible representations of the deformed algebra (24), in the limit l \u2192\n0; a point that was not addressed by Vilela Mendes.\nb x , kw ), it is easy to show that\nWith [F \u03a6](kx , kw ) = \u03a6(k\nb\n[F (Ul \u03a6)](kx , kw ) = \u03a6 (kx , kw + 1/l). Thus, considering\nb obtained from Eqs. (23) (with\nthe representation in H\nd = 1), the irreducible components contributing to the direct integral are defined from wave functions having support on circles centered at the point kx = 0, kw = \u22121/l\nin (kx , kw )-space; i.e.,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n2\nkx + kw +\n= \u03c120 .\n(29)\nl\n\nTo obtain the usual representation of the Heisenberg algebra as l \u2192 0, we must arrive at wave functions in\nthe limiting representation that become independent of\nkw . However, from Eq. (29), we see that if we try to let\nl \u2192 0 while \u03c10 is held fixed, we obtain no such limit;\nrather, |kw | becomes arbitrarily large while the operator\np (2) (which acts through multiplication by ~kx ) remains\nbounded. The way out of this difficulty is to allow \u03c10 to\ndepend on l. Taking \u03c10 = 1/l in (29), we have for very\nsmall l a circle of very large radius tangent to the horizontal axis at the origin, approximating the line kw = 0;\nindeed,\n\u00011\n1 1\n1 \u2212 kx2 l2 2 ;\nkw = \u2212 +\nl\nl\n\n(30)\n\nso that for any fixed value of kx , kw \u2248 \u2212(1/2)kx2 l \u2192 0\nin the limit as l \u2192 0. Thus, traversing a parameterized\nfamily of irreducible representations labeled by \u03c10 = 1/l\n(or at least, having the property that \u03c10 tends toward 1/l\nas l \u2192 0) is the appropriate way to obtain the Heisenberg\nalgebra in the limiting irreducible representation.\nMoreover, the condition \u03c10 = 1/l allows the operator p (2) (whose spectrum is bounded by ~\u03c10 ) to become\nunbounded as desired when l \u2192 0.\nIV.\n\nTHE KINETIC ENERGY AND HARMONIC\nOSCILLATOR HAMILTONIANS\n\nTo investigate in detail the quantum-mechanical behavior of a particle system described by the deformed algebra, such as the harmonic oscillator with a fundamental\n\nlength scale, we need to settle on the form of the kinetic\nenergy part of the Hamiltonian H0 , and write the total\nHamiltonian H = H0 + V . In [8] it was suggested that\nfor a particle of mass m, we should use H0 = p 2 /2m,\nwhere p is the generator appearing in the algebra of Eqs.\n(24), and that the oscillator Hamiltonian should then be\nHosc = p 2 /2m + m \u03c9 2 q 2 /2.\nBut one reasonable criterion for determining the choice\nof H0 is the physical condition that the time-derivative\nof the particle position should be the particle velocity.\nThat is, we should expect H0 and Hosc to satisfy,\nq\u0307 =\n\n1\n1\np\n[ q, H0 ] =\n[ q, Hosc ] = .\ni~\ni~\nm\n\nHowever, we have from Eqs. (24) that\n\u0014\n\u0015\np2\n1\n1\nq,\n=\n(p J + J p ) ,\ni~\n2m\n2m\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nwhich becomes p/m when J is the identity operator, but\nnot otherwise. To fulfill Eq. (31) we propose to modify\nthe form of the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian,\nso that\n\u001a\n\u001b\n~2\n1\np 2 + 2 (J \u2212 I)2 ,\n(33)\nH0 =\n2m\nl\nwhere I is the identity operator in a representation of the\nalgebra. Note that the coefficient ~ 2 /l 2 in (33) is needed\nto obtain the correct commutation relation with q.\nNow, in the representation q (2) , p(2) , J (2) of the deformed algebra given by Eqs.

(33). From\n(19), however, we see that the potential energy term no\n2\nlonger acts via multiplication in Ldxdw\n, but as a differential operator via further derivative terms.\n\n\f7\nV.\n\nDISCRETIZED AND EXTENDED LOCAL\nCURRENT ALGEBRAS\n\nIn this section we explore two approaches to the introduction of local currents.\nIn the first approach, we interpret locality with respect\nto a basis of eigenvectors of q in an irreducible representation of the deformed Heisenberg algebra (24). This leads\nto discretized mass and momentum density operators;\ni.e., a theory on a lattice.\nIn the second approach, we interpret \"locality\" with respect to the (xw)-space on which representations of (24)\nare modeled. Here we consider two possibilities. The\nfirst is to work straightforwardly with the nonrelativistic current algebra in two-dimensional space (LCA2) to\ndescribe the one-dimensional, deformed quantum kinematics, while the second is to introduce a semidirect sum\nof LCA2 with the algebra of vector fields on the line.\nIn the discussion, we note the tension occurring between\nlocality and irreducibility.\nA.\n\nJ p (h) =\nand\n\n\u221e\n1 X e\nh(nl){ p |nli hnl| + |nli hnl| p }\n2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnl|nlihnl| ,\n\nI=\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n|nlihnl| .\n\n\u221e\n1 X\nre (nl) { J |nli hnl| + |nli hnl| J },\n2 n=\u2212\u221e\n(42)\ne\ne\nwhere h (nl) \u2261 (1/2) [ h (nl) + h ((n + 1) l) ] and r (nl) \u2261\n(1/2) [ e\nr (nl) + re ((n + 1) l) ] are also taken to be compactly supported. As e\nh(nl) and re(nl) approximate the\nfunction that is identically 1, so do h(nl) and r(nl); then\nJ p (h) approximates p, J J (r) approximates J , and the\nglobal algebra is recovered.\nFrom Eqs. (39)-(42), we find\n\nJ p (h) =\n\nThe corresponding local mass density operator J q takes\nthe form\nJ q (g) = m\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn =\u2212\u221e\n\ng(nl) |nli hnl| ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere in analogy with the continuum case, the realvalued function g has compact support; i.e., for some\nN > 0, g(nl) = 0 whenever |nl| > N l. When g(nl)\napproximates the function nl, J q (g) approximates the\nmoment operator mq. When g(nl) \u2265 0 (\u2200n \u2208 Z), J q (g)\nis a positive operator. When g(nl) approximates the constant function 1, J q (g) approximates the mass times the\nidentity operator. As we are in a representation of the\nlocal currents describing a single particle, we can interpret (1/m)J q (g) as a spatial probability density operator\naveraged with g(nl).\nEqn. (25) implies\n~\u03c10\nhnl| p |mli =\n(\u03b4n+1,m \u2212 \u03b4n\u22121,m )\n2i\n\n(39)\n\nand\nhnl| J |mli =\n\nl\u03c10\n(\u03b4n+1,m + \u03b4n\u22121,m ) .\n2\n\n\u221e\n~\u03c10 X\nh (nl) { |nli h(n + 1) l|\n2i n=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212 |(n + 1) li hnl| } ,\n\n(37)\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\nJ J (r) =\n\nLocality with respect to the discrete\npositional spectrum\n\nIn an irreducible representation of Eqs. (25), the spectrum of the self-adjoint operator representing the generator q is discrete, given by nl for n \u2208 Z; write the\ncorresponding eigenvector as |nli. We shall then write\nq |nli = nl|nli, and\nq=\n\nIntroduce the local currents\n\nJ J (r) =\n\n(43)\n\n\u221e\nl\u03c10 X\nr (nl) { |nli h(n + 1) l|\n2 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n+ |(n + 1) li hnl| } .\n\n(44)\n\nFor the Lie algebra of currents generated by these operators, in the irreducible representation labeled by \u03c10 , to\nbe local, we need the commutator brackets of the operators J q (g), J p (h), and J J (r) given by Eqs. (38), (43),\nand (44) to yield similarly local expressions. These expressions are all linear combinations of operators of the\nform |nli hnl|, |nli h(n + 1) l|, and |(n + 1) li hnl|.\nIn fact, we have\n[J q (g1 ) , J q (g2 )] = 0 ,\n\n[J q (g) , J p (h)] = \u2212i\n\nm~\nJ J (r) ,\nl\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nwhere r (nl) = h(nl) { g (nl) \u2212 g ([n + 1] l)}, and\n[J q (g) , J J (r)] = i\n\nml\nJ p (h) ,\n~\n\n(47)\n\nwhere h (nl) = r (nl) (g (nl) \u2212 g ([n + 1] l)), which thus\nfar are satisfactorily local.\nBut other commutators, such as [J p (h) , J J (r)], generate terms of the\nform |(n + 1) li h(n \u2212 1) l| and |(n \u2212 1) li h(n + 1) l|, so\nthat successive commutators generate additional terms\n|(n \u2212 m) li h(n + m) l| and |(n + m) li h(n \u2212 m) l|, for\narbitrary m \u2208 Z. Therefore, to close the Lie algebra\n\n\f8\nof these currents, one is forced to include new basis elements in the (already infinite-dimensional) current algebra, having more general forms; e.g.,\n\u221e\nX\n\nn,m=\u2212\u221e\n\n+l\u03c10\n\nwhere s is a compactly supported function on the square\nlattice of points (nl, ml). Such currents are nonlocal in\nthe positional eigenvalues, since (n \u2212 m)l and (n + m)l\nbecome arbitrarily far apart. This sort of behavior by the\ncommutation relations of discretized local derivatives is\nwell-known in the context of lattice models.\nBefore leaving the discussion of the discretized current\nalgebra, it is worth remarking that we do have within this\nframework an equation of continuity for the deformed\nquantum theory, relating the time-derivative of J q to the\nspatial divergence of Jp . Taking the Hamiltonian H to\nbe H0 + V (q), with H0 given by Eq.

Evidently Eq. (50) is precisely the required continuity equation. The density J q\nand current J p that appear in this equation of continuity\nare local, but they belong to a Lie algebra that necessarily includes currents that are nonlocal with respect to the\npositional operator q.\nB.\n\nLocality with respect to the extended\nspatial manifold\n\nConsider again the global Lie algebra given by Eqs.\n(24). A quite different approach to introducing local currents is suggested by the form of the representation of this\nLie algebra by Eqs. (19), with d = 1. The idea is to define a current algebra that is local in (x, w)-space, from\nwhich-with the right choices of limiting test functions-\nwe shall be able to recover Eqs. (19).\n\n\f9\nThus let us refer back to the LCA of Eqs. (12),\nand interpret these equations as applying in a twodimensional Euclidean space with coordinates (x, w), extending the spatial manifold by one dimension. We then\nhave the operator-valued distribution Q (h, gx , gw ) acting\nin L2dxdw , where h is drawn from the space of compactlysupported, real-valued C \u221e test functions on (x, w)-space,\nand gx , gw are the components of a compactly-supported,\nC \u221e vector field on (x, w)-space:\nQ(h, gx , gw ) = h (x, w) +\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n+\ngx (x, w)}\n+ { gx (x, w)\n2i\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n+\ngw (x, w)} . (52)\n+ { gw (x, w)\n2i\n\u2202w\n\u2202w\nDefining Ql (h, gx , gw ) = Q(h, lgx , lgw ) for l > 0, we obtain a family of operators parameterized by l. In the\nl \u2192 0 limit, Ql (h, gx , gw ) reduces to Q(h, 0, 0). Then\nwith\n\u03c1(f ) = lim m Q(h, 0, 0) ,\n\n(53)\n\nh\u2192f\n\nwe recover the earlier one-particle mass density operator\nin one space dimension. The limit here pertains to the\nfact that f depends only on x and is independent of w,\nwhile h is compactly supported in (x, w)-space.\nThe local current Ql (h, gx , gw ) is clearly motivated by\nthe form of q (2) in Eq. (19); in fact, in the limit where\nh(x, w) approaches the coordinate function x, and the\nvector field (gx (x, w), gw (x, w)) approaches (\u2212w, x), we\nrecover q (2) with the space dimension d = 1. Evidently, Q\n(or, alternatively, Ql ) is also sufficiently general to let us\nobtain the other global operators in the deformed current\nalgebra, when suitable limits of h, gx and gw are taken.\nThus the operator p(2) (with d = 1) is just Q(0, ~gx , 0) or\nQl (0, (~/l)gx, 0), taken in the limit where gx approaches\nthe constant vector field of magnitude 1. Likewise J (2)\nis Q(h, 0, lgw ) or Ql (h, 0, gw ), taken in the limit where\nboth h and gw become identically 1.\nThe natural choices of local currents corresponding to\np(2) and J (2) are, respectively,\nJ(g) =\n\n~\n\u2202\n\u2202\n{ g (x)\n+\ng (x)}\n2i\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\n(54)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nl\n{k (w)\n+\nk (w)} ,\n2i\n\u2202w \u2202w\n\n(55)\n\nand\nJ (k) = k (w) +\n\nwhere g(x) and k(w) are compactly-supported C \u221e functions on R. These local currents incorporate the intuitive\nidea of local flows in the two coordinate directions. To\nexpress them in terms of Q or Ql , we write (again recalling that the arguments of Q are compactly supported in\nboth the x and w coordinates):\nJ(g) = lim Q(0, ~gx, 0) = lim Ql (0,\ngx \u2192g\n\ngx \u2192g\n\n~\ngx , 0)\nl\n\n(56)\n\nand\nJ (k) = lim lim Q(h, 0, lgw ) = lim lim Ql (h, 0, gw ) .\nh\u2192k gw \u2192k\n\nh\u2192k gw \u2192k\n\n(57)\nBecause of the way the operator q (2) mixes the x and\nthe w directions, it is necessary to incorporate the full\n(x, w)-dependence in the test functions h, gx and gw that\nappear as arguments of Q. Then the current algebra that\naccommodates all the natural local and global limits is\njust LCA2; i.e., the algebra of the Q(h, gx , gw ) satisfying\nthe semidirect sum Lie algebra of Eq. (13) with d = 2.\nSo we have the usual local current algebra of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, but localized in two space\ndimensions rather than just one.\nAn interesting feature of this framework is that the\ndecomposition of L2dxdw (R2 ) into a direct integral of irreducible representations of the global algebra (labeled,\nas in Sec. III, by \u03c10 ), is not respected by the one-particle\nirreducible representation of the LCA. That is, the local\ncurrents unavoidably connect the reducing subspaces of\nthe global algebra. We have a kind of tension between our\ndesire to incorporate local currents, and the assumption\nthat we can work with a single, irreducible representation\nof the global, deformed algebra.\nThis situation does not occur for the usual Heisenberg algebra, where the Hilbert space for a single irreducible representation labeled by ~ also carries the oneparticle representation of the full LCA. However, it is\nreminiscent of earlier results pertaining to self-adjoint\nrepresentations of the LCA describing spinning particles\nin three space dimensions. Here irreducible representations of the global algebra describe quantum particles\nwith fixed spin-i.e., the operators act within a single\nirreducible representation of SU (2)-while the local currents inevitably contain spin-changing terms, that connect representations associated with a tower of different\nspins [27].\nLet us take another look at how we can recover LCA1\nas the l \u2192 0 limit of LCA2 in the single-particle representation written above. If we take the operators Ql\nas our starting point, with fixed test functions (h, gx , gw )\nindependent of l, then as l \u2192 0 and h \u2192 f , we recover\nonly the density operator \u03c1(f ), not the full LCA1. To recover the local currents J(g) in the l \u2192 0 limit, we must\nallow at least some of the test functions themselves to be\nl-dependent, as in Eq. (56). But the form of J(g) in Eq.\n(54) is actually independent of l. This suggests that, for\ngiven l, we consider an extension of the current algebra\nLCA2 (generated by the Ql (h, gx , gw )) by the algebra of\nvector fields on the line (generated by the J(g) in Eq.\n(54)), via the bracket\n\nwhere\n\n[ Ql (h, gx , gw ) , J (g)] = i~Ql (e\nh, e\ngx , gew ),\n\n(58)\n\n\u2202\ne\nh (x, w) = g (x)\nh (x, w) ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n\u2202\ngx (x, w) = g (x)\ne\ngx (x, w) \u2212 gx (x, w)\ng (x) ,\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n\f10\ngew (x, w) = g (x)\n\n\u2202\ngw (x, w) .\n\u2202x\n\n(59)\n\nNote in Eqs. (58)-(59) that h, e\nh are compactly-supported,\nC \u221e functions on (x, w)-space, (gx , gw ) and (gex , gf\nw ) are\ncompactly-supported, C \u221e vector fields on (x, w)-space,\nwhile g is a compactly-supported, C \u221e vector field in the\nx-coordinate only.\nNow in the limit l \u2192 0, Ql (h, gx , gw ) becomes multiplication by h(x, w), while J(g) survives as the operator\nfor total momentum density in the x-direction, independent of (or integrated over) w. The representation is still\nreducible; w has become a kind of unobservable, internal coordinate for a particle theory in one space dimension. This construction also generalizes to higher space\ndimensions, augmented by the one additional coordinate\nw. Note, however, that the form of the kinetic energy\n(2)\nterm in the Hamiltonian, given by H0 in Eq. (34), is\nindependent of l; the second derivative with respect to w\ndoes not vanish as l \u2192 0. Upon taking this limit, we can\nuse the fact that the operators \u03c1(f ) and J(g) commute\nwith \u2202 2 /\u2202w2 to recover the continuity equation in the\ncontinuum,\n\u03c1\u0307(f ) =\n\n1\ndf\n[ \u03c1(f ), H0 ] = J( ),\ni~\ndx\n\n(60)\n\nand the ordinary quantum mechanics of a free particle\nhaving x as its positional coordinate.\nFor local currents as defined by Eq. (52) in (x, w)space, we can also write an equation of continuity for a\nfree particle,\n\nformed harmonic oscillator), then V (q) does not commute with m Q\u0307(h, 0, 0) and we have no such continuity\nequation.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn the case of one space dimension, we have described two\napproaches to introducing fixed-time local currents for a\nsubalgebra of the deformed Poincar\u00e9-Heisenberg algebra\ndiscussed by Vilela Mendes. The first requires a nonlocal Lie algebra generated by discretized local currents,\nbut the currents act within an irreducible representation\nof the global algebra. The second requires adjoining an\nextra dimension to the spatial manifold, and the local\ncurrents connect the reducing subspaces in a direct integral of irreducible representations of the global algebra.\nFrom our perspective, the latter approach offers some\nattractive possibilities. We have mentioned above the existence of many interesting, inequivalent representations\nof LCA2, including representations describing N particles satisfying the statistics of anyons. This suggests a\npossible new interpretation of such representations-not\nas describing conventional particles in two-space, but as\ndescribing local currents for a deformed algebra of quantum mechanics having some anyonic properties. Such an\ninterpretation is a topic of continuing investigation by\nthe authors.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\n\u2202h \u2202h\nm\n[ Q(h, 0, 0), H0 ] = ~Q(0,\n,\n).\ni~\n\u2202x \u2202w\n(61)\nBut note that Q(h, 0, 0) is no longer a positional mass\ndensity.
