In the last\ndecade or so, the field of helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of this\nvelocity field. In particular, the internal differential rotation of the Sun is now fairly\nwell constrained by helioseismic observations almost throughout the solar convection\nzone. Helioseismology also gives us some information about the depth-dependence of\nthe meridional circulation in the near-surface layers of the Sun. The typical velocity\ninputs used in solar dynamo models, however, continue to be an analytic fit to the observed differential rotation profile and a theoretically constructed meridional circulation\nprofile that is made to match the flow speed only at the solar surface. Here we take the\nfirst steps towards the use of more accurate velocity fields in solar dynamo models by\npresenting methodologies for constructing differential rotation and meridional circulation profiles that more closely conform to the best observational constraints currently\navailable. We also present kinematic dynamo simulations driven by direct helioseismic\nmeasurements for the rotation and four plausible profiles for the internal meridional\ncirculation \u2013 all of which are made to match the helioseismically inferred near-surface\ndepth-dependence, but whose magnitudes are made to vary. We discuss how the results\nfrom these dynamo simulations compare with those that are driven by purely analytic\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nfits to the velocity field. Our results and analysis indicate that the latitudinal shear in\nthe rotation in the bulk of the solar convection zone plays a more important role, than\neither the tachocline or surface radial shear, in the induction of the toroidal field. We\nalso find that it is the speed of the equatorward counterflow in the meridional circulation right at the base of the solar convection zone, and not how far into the radiative\ninterior it penetrates, that primarily determines the dynamo cycle period. Improved\nhelioseismic constraints are expected to be available from future space missions such\nas the Solar Dynamics Observatory and through analysis of more long-term continuous\ndata sets from ground-based instruments such as the Global Oscillation Network Group.\nOur analysis lays the basis for the assimilation of these helioseismic data within dynamo\nmodels to make future solar cycle simulations more realistic.\nSubject headings: Sun: magnetic fields, Sun: interior, Sun: rotation, Sun: helioseismology, Sun: activity\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe dynamic nature of solar activity can often be traced back to the presence and evolution\nof magnetic fields in the Sun. The more intense magnetic fields on the order of 1000 Gauss (G)\nare observed to be concentrated within regions known as sunspots, which often appear in pairs of\nopposite magnetic polarities (Hale 1908). Sunspots have been observed regularly now for about\nfour centuries starting with the telescopic observations of Galileo Galilei in the early 1600s. These\nobservations point out that the number of sunspots on the solar surface varies in a cyclic fashion\nwith an average periodicity of 11 years (Schwabe 1844), although there are variations both in the\namplitude and period of this cycle. At the beginning of a cycle sunspots appear at about midlatitudes in both hemispheres (with opposite polarity orientation across the hemispheres) and then\nprogressively appear at lower and lower latitudes as the cycle progresses (Carrington 1858) until no\nsunspots are seen (i.e., solar minimum). In the next cycle, the same pattern repeats, but the new\ncycle spots have their bipolar magnetic orientation reversed relative to the previous cycle (in both\nhemispheres). So considering sign as well as amplitude, the solar cycle has a period of 22 years.\nThere is a weaker, more diffuse component of the magnetic field outside of sunspots which\nis seen to have a somewhat different evolution. This field \u2013 whose radial component has been\nobservable at the solar surface since the advent of the magnetograph \u2013 was believed to be on the\norder of 10 Gauss. It is found that this field is concentrated in unipolar patches, which originate\nat sunspot latitudes at the time of sunspot maxima, and then moves poleward with the progress\nof the sunspot cycle (Babcock 1959; Bumba and Howard 1965; Howard and LaBonte 1981). The\nsign of this radial field of any given cycle is opposite to the old cycle polar field, which it cancels\nand reverses upon reaching the poles. The amplitude of this radial field achieves a maximum\n(at the poles) at the time of sunspot minimum (i.e. with a 90\u25e6 phase difference relative to the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nsunspots). However, the periodicity of the cycle of this field matches the sunspot cycle period,\nunderscoring that they are related. Recent observations by Hinode indicate that this radial field\ngets concentrated within unipolar flux tubes with field strength on the order of 103 Gauss (Tsuneta\net al. 2008).\nExplanations of this observations of the solar magnetic cycle rely on the field of magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory, which seeks to address the generation and evolution of magnetic\nfields as a complex non-linear process involving interactions between the magnetic field and plasma\nflows within the solar interior. In particular, it is now believed that the solar cycle involves the\ngeneration and recycling (feeding on the energy available in plasma motions) of two components\nof the magnetic field \u2013 the toroidal component and the poloidal component. In an axisymmetric\nspherical coordinate system, the magnetic and velocity fields can be expressed as\nB = B\u03c6 \u00ea\u03c6 + \u2207 \u00d7 (A\u00ea\u03c6 )\nv = r sin(\u03b8)\u03a9\u00ea\u03c6 + vp\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side (R.H.S.) of Equations 1 and 2 is the toroidal component\n(in the case of the velocity field this corresponds to the differential rotation) and the second term\nis the poloidal component of the field (in the case of the velocity field this corresponds to the\nmeridional circulation). The toroidal component of the magnetic field is thought to be produced\nby stretching of an initially poloidal field by the differential rotation of the Sun (the dynamo\n\u03a9-effect); subsequently, strong toroidal flux loops rise up due to magnetic buoyancy emerging\nthrough the solar surface as sunspots (Parker 1955a). To complete the dynamo cycle, the poloidal\nfield (whose radial component is manifested as the observed vertical field on the solar surface)\nhas to be regenerated from this toroidal field in a process that is traditionally called the dynamo\n\u03b1-effect. The first explanation of this \u03b1-effect was due to Parker (1955b) who suggested that helical\nturbulent convection in the solar convection zone (SCZ) would twist rising toroidal flux tubes into\nthe poloidal plane, recreating the poloidal component of the magnetic field. Much has changed\nsince this pioneering description of the first solar dynamo model by Parker, although the basic\nnotion of the recycling of the toroidal and poloidal components remain the same.\nFirst of all, simulations of the buoyant rise of toroidal flux tubes point out that to match\nthe observed properties of sunspots at the solar surface, the strength of these flux tubes at the\nbase of the SCZ has to be much more than the equipartition field strength of 104 G (D'Silva\n& Choudhuri 1993; Fan, Fisher & DeLuca 1993). The classical dynamo \u03b1-effect due to helical\nturbulence is expected to be quenched for super-equipartition field strengths and therefore other\nphysical processes have to be invoked as a regeneration mechanism for the poloidal field. One of\nthe alternatives is an idea originally due to Babcock (1961) and Leighton (1969). The Babcock and\nLeighton (hereby BL) model proposes that the decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar sunspot pairs at\nthe near-surface layers, mediated by diffusion, differential rotation, and meridional circulation, can\nregenerate the poloidal field. This mechanism is actually observed and is simulated as a surface flux\ntransport process that can reproduce the solar polar field reversals (Wang, Nash & Sheeley 1989).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nTherefore a synthesis of Parker's original description along with the BL mechanism for poloidal\nfield generation is now widely accepted as a leading contender for explaining the solar dynamo\nmechanism (Choudhuri, Sch\u00fcssler & Dikpati 1995; Durney 1997; Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999;\nNandy & Choudhuri 2001; Nandy 2003), although there are other alternative suggestions as well.\nA description of all of those is beyond the scope of this paper and interested readers are referred\nto the review by Charbonneau (2005).\nSecond, helioseismology has now mapped the solar internal rotation profile (Schou et al. 1998;\nCharbonneau et al. 1999), which is observed to be vary mainly in the latitudinal direction in the\nmain body of the SCZ. Helioseismology has also discovered the tachocline \u2013 a region of strong radial\nand latitudinal shear beneath the base of the SCZ which is expected to play an important role in\nthe generation and storage of strong toroidal flux tubes.\nThird, more is now known about the meridional circulation, which is observed to be polewards\nat the surface (Hathaway 1996). To conserve mass, this circulation should turn equatorwards in\nthe solar interior. This circulation is deemed to be important for the dynamics of the solar cycle\n(see Hathaway et al. 2003 and the review by Nandy 2004) but the profile of this in the solar\ninterior remains poorly constrained. Nandy and Choudhuri (2002) proposed a deep equatorward\ncounterflow in the circulation (penetrating into the radiative interior beneath the SCZ) to better\nreproduce in dynamo simulations the latitudinal distribution of sunspots (because equatorward\nadvective transport and storage of the deep seated toroidal field is more efficient at these depths\nwhere turbulence is greatly reduced). However, Gilman and Miesch (2004), based on a laminar\nanalysis, argued that the penetration of the circulation would be limited to a shallow Ekman layer\nclose to the base of SCZ. A recent and more detailed analysis of the problem by Garaud and\nBrummell (2008) suggests that the circulation can in fact penetrate deeper down into the radiative\ninterior. At this point there is no consensus on the profile and nature of the meridional circulation\nin the solar interior. Helioseismic data does provide some information about the depth-dependence\nof this circulation at near-surface layers (Braun & Fan 1998, Giles 2000, Chou & Ladenkov 2005 ,\nGonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006), which, in conjunction with reasonable theoretical arguments, can\nbe used to construct some plausible interior profiles of this flow.\nNumerous kinematic dynamo models have been constructed in recent years (see Charbonneau\n2005 for a review) incorporating these large scale flows (differential rotation and meridional circulation) as drivers of the magnetic evolution. More recently such dynamo models (based on the\nBL idea of poloidal field generation) have also been utilized to make predictions for the upcoming\ncycle (Dikpati, de Toma & Gilman 2006; Choudhuri, Chatterjee & Jiang 2007). At present, all\nthese kinematic dynamo models incorporate the information on large-scale flows as analytic fits to\nthe differential rotation profile and a theoretically constructed meridional circulation profile that\nis subject to mass conservation but matches the flow speed only at the solar surface (i.e., without\nincorporating the depth-dependent information that is available). However, these large-scale flows\nare crucial to the generation and transport of magnetic fields; the differential rotation is the primary\nsource of the toroidal field that creates solar active regions, and the meridional flow is thought to\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nplay a crucial role in coupling the two source regions for the poloidal and toroidal field through\nadvective flux transport. Given this, it is obvious that the next step in constructing more sophisticated dynamo models of the solar cycle is to move towards a more rigorous use of helioseismic\ndata to constrain these models in a way such that they conform more closely to the best available\nobservational constraints; that is the goal of this study.\nIn Section 2, we describe the basic features of the kinematic dynamo model based on the BL\nidea that we use for our study; in this model, we use fairly standard parametrization (commonly\nused in the community) of various processes such as the diffusivity, dynamo \u03b1-effect and magnetic\nbuoyancy. In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we present the methodologies for using the helioseismically\nobserved solar differential rotation and constraining the meridional circulation profiles within this\ndynamo model and describe how they improve upon the commonly used analytic profiles. In Section\n4 we present results from dynamo simulations using these improved helioseismic constraints and\nconclude in Section 5 with a summary of our main results and their contextual relevance.\n\n2.\n\nOur Model\n\nWe substitute Equations 1 and 2 into the magnetic induction equation\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207 \u00d7 B)\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nand add the phenomenological BL poloidal field source \u03b1 to obtain the axisymmetric dynamo\nequations:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202A 1\n1\n2\n+ [vp * \u2207(sA)] = \u03b7 \u2207 \u2212 2 A + \u03b1(r, \u03b8)F (Bav )Bav ,\n(4)\n\u2202t\ns\ns\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202B\nB\n1\n2\n+ s vp * \u2207\n+ (\u2207 * vp )B = \u03b7 \u2207 \u2212 2 B + s ([\u2207 \u00d7 (A\u00ea\u03c6 )] * \u2207\u03a9)\n(5)\n\u2202t\ns\ns\n1 \u2202(sB) \u2202\u03b7\n+\n,\ns \u2202r \u2202r\nwhere s = r sin(\u03b8). The terms on the LHS of both equations with the poloidal velocity (vp )\ncorrespond to the advection and deformation of the magnetic field by the meridional flow. The first\nterm on the RHS of both equations corresponds to the diffusion of the magnetic field. The second\nterm on the RHS of both equations is the source of that type of magnetic field (BL mechanism for\nA and rotational shear for B). Finally, the third term on the RHS of Equation 5 corresponds to\nthe advection of toroidal field due to a turbulent diffusivity gradient.\nAs mentioned before, the generation of poloidal field near the surface due to the decay of active\nregions is modeled through the inclusion of a source term, which acts as a source for the vector\npotential A. It is localized both in radius and latitude matching observations of active region\nemergence patterns and depends on the average toroidal field at the bottom of the convection\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nzone (Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999). The radial and latitudinal dependence of the source is the\nfollowing:\n\u0013\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03b10\n\u03b8 \u2212 (90o + \u03b2)\n\u03b8 \u2212 (90o \u2212 \u03b2)\n\u03b1(r, \u03b8) =\n1 \u2212 erf\ncos(\u03b8) 1 + erf\n16\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n(6)\nr \u2212 rah\nr \u2212 ral\n1 \u2212 erf\n\u2217 1 + erf\ndal\ndah\nwhere \u03b10 sets the strength of the source term and we set it to the value in which our system\nstarts having oscillating solutions. The parameters \u03b2 = 40o and \u03b3 = 10o characterize the latitudes\nin which sunspots appear. On the other hand, ral = 0.94R , dal = 0.04R , rah = R and\ndah = 0.01R characterize the radial extent of the region in which the poloidal field is deposited\n(see Figure 1-a and b). Besides radial and latitudinal dependence, we also introduce lower and\nupper operating thresholds on the poloidal source that is dependent on toroidal field amplitude\n\u2013 which is a more realistic representation of the physics involving magnetic buoyancy (as argued\nin Nandy & Choudhuri 2001; Nandy 2002; see also Charbonneau, St-Jean & Zacharias 2005).\nThe presence of a lower threshold is in response to the fact that the plasma density inside weak\nflux tubes is not low enough (compared to the density of the surrounding plasma) to make them\nunstable to buoyancy (Caligari, Moreno-Insertis & Schussler 1995) and those that manage to rise\nhave very long rising times (Fan, Fisher and De Luca 1993). On the other hand, if flux tubes are\ntoo strong they are not tilted enough when they reach the surface to contribute to poloidal field\ngeneration (D'Silva and Choudhuri 1993; Fan, Fisher and Deluca 1993). The dependence of the\npoloidal source on magnetic field is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nKae\n1\nF (Bav ) =\n1\u2212\n,\n(7)\n1 + (Bav /Bh )2\n1 + (Bav /Bl )2\nwhere Kae = 1/ max(F (Bav )) is a normalization constant and Bh = 1.5 \u00d7 105 G and Bl = 4 \u00d7 104 G\nare the operating thresholds (see Figure 1-c).\nAnother ingredient of this model is a radially dependent magnetic diffusivity; in this work we\nuse a double-step profile (see Figure 2) given by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u03b7sg \u2212 \u03b7cz \u2212 \u03b7bcd\nr \u2212 rsg\nr \u2212 rcz\n\u03b7cz \u2212 \u03b7bcd\n1 + erf\n+\n1 + erf\n,\n(8)\n\u03b7(r) = \u03b7bcd +\n2\ndcz\n2\ndsg\nwhere \u03b7bcd = 108 cm2 /s corresponds to the diffusivity at the bottom of the computational domain,\u03b7cz =\n1011 cm2 /s corresponds to the diffusivity in the convection zone, \u03b7sg = 1013 cm2 /s corresponds to\nthe supergranular diffusivity and rcz = 0.73R , dcz = 0.03R , rsg = 0.95R and dsg = 0.05R\ncharacterize the transitions from one value of diffusivity to the other. Although it is common these\ndays to use these sort of profile, a point we note in passing is that the exact depth dependence\nof turbulent diffusivity within the SCZ is poorly, if at all, constrained. Besides the value of the\nsupergranular diffusivity \u03b7sg , which can be estimated by observations (Hathaway & Choudhary\n2008), the others parameters are not necessarily well constrained.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nOnce all ingredients are defined(see Section 3 for the flow field), we solve the dynamo equations\nusing a recently developed and novel numerical technique called exponential propagation (see Appendix). Our computational domain is defined in a 250 \u00d7 250 grid comprising only one hemisphere.\nSince we run our simulations only in one hemisphere our latitudinal boundary conditions at the\nequator (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2) are \u2202A/\u2202\u03b8 = 0 and B = 0. Furthermore, since the equations we are solving are\naxisymmetric, both the potential vector and the toroidal field need to be zero (A = 0 and B = 0) at\nthe pole (\u03b8 = 0), to avoid singularities in spherical coordinates. For the lower boundary condition\n(r = 0.55R ), we assume a perfectly conducting core, such that both the poloidal field and the\ntoroidal field vanish there (i.e., A, B = 0 at the lower boundary). For the upper boundary condition\nwe assume that the magnetic field has only a radial component (B = 0 and \u2202(rA)/\u2202r = 0); this condition has been found necessary for stress balance between subsurface and coronal magnetic fields\n(for more details refer to van Ballegooijen and Mackay 2007). As initial conditions we set A = 0\nthroughput our computational domain and B \u221d sin(2\u03b8) \u2217 sin(\u03c0 \u2217 ((r \u2212 0.55R )/(R \u2212 0.55R ))).\nAfter a few cycles, all transients related to the initial conditions typically disappear and the dynamo\nsettles into regular oscillatory solutions whose properties are determined by the parameters in the\ndynamo equations.\n\n3.\n\nConstraining the Flow Fields\n\nThe last two ingredients of the dynamo model are the velocity fields (differential rotation and\nmeridional circulation), which are the focus of this work. The differential rotation is probably the\nbest constrained of all dynamo ingredients but the actual helioseismology data has never before\nbeen used directly in dynamo model, only an analytical fit to it. We discuss below how the\nactual rotation data can be used directly within dynamo models through the use of a weighting\nfunction to filter out the observational data in the region where it cannot be trusted. On the other\nhand, the meridional circulation is one of the most loosely constrained ingredients of the dynamo.\nTraditionally only the peak surface flow speed is used to constrain the analytical functions that are\nused to parameterize it, in conjunction with mass conservation. In this work we take advantage\nof the properties of such functions and make a fit to the helioseismic data on the meridional flow\nthat constrains the location and extent of the polar downflow and equatorial upflow, as well as the\nradial dependence of the meridional flow near the surface \u2013 thereby taking steps towards better\nconstrained flow profiles.\n\n3.1.\n\nDifferential Rotation\n\nAs opposed to meridional circulation, there are helioseismic measurements of the differential\nrotation for most of the convective envelope which can be used directly in our simulations. Here\nwe use data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) (courtesy Dr. Rachel Howe)\nobtained using the RLS inversion mapped onto a 51 \u00d7 51 grid (see Figure 3-a). However, these\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nobservations cannot be trusted fully in the region within 0.3R of the rotation axis (specifically at\nhigh latitudes), because the inversion kernels have very little amplitude there. Below we outline a\nmethod to deal with this suspect data by creating a composite rotation profile that replaces these\ndata at high latitudes with plausible synthetic data, that smoothly matches to the observations in\nthe region of trust.\n\n3.1.1.\n\nAdaptation of the Data to the Model\n\nIn the first step we use a splines interpolation in order to map the data to the resolution of\nour simulation (a grid of 250 \u00d7 250 see Figure 3-a). The next step is to make a composite with the\ndata and the analytical form of Charbonneau et al. (1999; see Figure 3-b). The analytical form is\ndefined as:\nh\n\u0011\u0011\ni\n\u0010\n\u0010\ntc\n\u03a9A (r, \u03b8) = 2\u03c0 \u03a9c + 21 1 \u2212 erf r\u2212r\n(\u03a9\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n+\n(\u03a9\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n)\u03a9\n(\u03b8))\ne\nc\np\ne\nS\nwtc\n\u03a9S (\u03b8) =\n\na cos2 (\u03b8)\n\n+ (1 \u2212\n\n(9)\n\na) cos4 (\u03b8),\n\nwhere \u03a9c = 432 nHz is the rotation frequency of the core, \u03a9e = 470 nHz is the rotation frequency\nof the equator, \u03a9p = 330 nHz is the rotation frequency of the pole, a = 0.483 is the strength of the\ncos2 (\u03b8) with respect to the cos4 (\u03b8) term, rtc = 0.716 the location of the tachocline and wtc = 0.03.\nWe use the parameters defining the tachocline's location and thickness as reported by Charbonneau\net al. (1999) for a latitude of 60o . This is because they match the data better at high latitudes\n(which is the place where the data merges with the analytical profile) than those reported for the\nequator. This composite replaces the suspect data at high latitudes within 0.3R of the rotation\naxis with that of the analytic profile. However, it is important to note that at low latitudes, within\nthe convection zone, the actual helioseismic data is utilized.\nIn order to make the composite we create a weighting function m(r, \u03b8) with values between 0\nand 1 for each grid-point defining how much information will come from the RLS data and how\nmuch from the analytical form (see Figure 3-d). We define the weighting function in the following\nway:\nm(r, \u03b8) = 1 \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1 + erf\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nr2 cos(2\u03b8) \u2212 rm\nd2m\n\n\u0013\u0013\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere rm = 0.5R is a parameter that controls the center of the transition and dm = 0.6R controls\nthe thickness. The resultant differential rotation profile, which can be seen in Figure 3-c, is then\ncalculated using the following expression:\n\u03a9(r, \u03b8) = m(r, \u03b8)\u03a9RLS (r, \u03b8) + [1 \u2212 m(r, \u03b8)]\u03a9A (r, \u03b8)\n\n(11)\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.1.2.\n\nDifferences Between the Analytical Profile and the Composite Data\n\nIt is instructive to compare the analytical and composite profiles with the actual helioseismology data. In Figure 4-a we present the residual error of subtracting the analytical profile of\nCharbonneau et al. (1999), with rtc = 0.7 and wtc = 0.025, from the RLS data. In Figure 4-b we\npresent the residual error of subtracting our composite from the RLS data. As is expected, there\nis no difference between the composite and raw data at low latitude, but the residual increases as\nwe approach the rotation axis \u2013 where the RLS data cannot be trusted. For the analytical profile,\nthe residuals errors are more significant, even at low latitudes. This demonstrates the ability of our\nmethodology to usefully integrate the helioseismic data for differential rotation.\n\n3.2.\n\nMeridional Circulation\n\nThe meridional flow profile remains rather poorly constrained in the solar interior even though\nthe available helioseismic data can be used to constrain the analytic flow profiles that are in use\ncurrently. Here we present ways to betters constrain this profile with helioseismic data. In order\nto do that, we use data from GONG (Courtesy Dr. Irene Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez) obtained using the\nring-diagrams technique. This data, which we can see in Figure 6-a, corresponds to a time average\nof the meridional flow between 2001 and 2006; and it comprises 19 values of r from R down to\na depth of 0.97R , and 15 different latitudes between \u221252.5o and 52.5o . It is important to note\nthat our work relies heavily in the assumption that the meridional flow is adequately described\nby a stream function with separable variables. This is consistent with the assumption present\nimplicitly in all work on axisymmetric solar dynamo models up to this date. Below we use this\nproperty of our stream function, along with weighted latitudinal and radial averages of the data,\nto completely constrain its latitudinal dependence, as well as the topmost ten percent of its radial\ndependence. As this data currently does not constrain the depth of penetration of the flow in the\ndeep solar interior, we explore two different plausible penetration depths of the circulation. For\nreasons described later, we choose to perform simulations with two different peak meridional flow\nspeeds, therefore exploring four plausible meridional flow profiles altogether.\n\n3.2.1.\n\nConstraining the Latitudinal Dependence of the Meridional Flow\n\nMeridional circulation has been typically implemented in these type of dynamo models by\nusing a stream function in combination with mass conservation, i.e.:\n\u2192\n\u2212\nv p (r, \u03b8) =\n\n1 ~\n\u2207 \u00d7 (\u03a8(r, \u03b8)b\ne\u03c6 ) .\n\u03c1(r)\n\n(12)\n\nThe two stream functions that are commonly used were proposed by van Ballegooijen and Choudhuri (1988) and by Dikpati and Choudhuri (1995). They have in common the separability of\nvariables and thus can be written in the following way:\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\u03a8(r, \u03b8) = v0 F (r)G(\u03b8),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere v0 is a constant which controls the amplitude of the meridional flow.\nUsing such a stream function the components of the meridional flow become:\nvr (r, \u03b8) = v0\n\nF (r) 1 \u2202\n(sin(\u03b8)G(\u03b8)) ,\nr\u03c1(r) sin(\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8\n\nv\u03b8 (r, \u03b8) = \u2212v0\n\n1 \u2202\n(rF (r))G(\u03b8),\nr\u03c1(r) \u2202r\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhich can themselves be separated into the multiplication of exclusively radially and latitudinally\ndependent functions. This property allows us to constrain the entire latitudinal dependence of this\nfamily of functions by using the available helioseismology data for v\u03b8 at the surface. This can be\ndone because the latitudinal dependence of v\u03b8 is exactly the same as that of the stream function\nand only the amplitude of this functional form changes with depth, see for example Figure 5 for\nthe latitudinal velocity at different depths used by van Ballegooijen and Choudhuri (1988). In this\nwork we assume a latitudinal dependence like the one they used, i.e.,\nG(\u03b8) = sin(q+1) (\u03b8) cos(\u03b8).\n\n(16)\n\nIn order to estimate the parameter q we first take a density weighted average of the helioseismic\ndata using the values for solar density from the Solar Model S (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996),\nsuch that\nP\nv\u03b8 (ri , \u03b8j )\u03c1(ri )\n.\n(17)\nv\u0304\u03b8 (\u03b8j ) = i P\ni \u03c1(ri )\nIn Figure 6-b we plot the meridional flow at different depths weighted by density, which we add for\neach latitude in order to find the average. We then use this average to make a least squares fit to\nthe analytical expression (eq 16), which we can see in Figure 6-c. We find that a value of q = 1 fits\nthe data best. This therefore constrains the latitudinal (\u03b8) dependence of the flow profile.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nConstraining the Radial Dependence of the Meridional Flow\n\nAs opposed to the latitudinal dependence, the radial dependence of the meridional flow is less\nconstrained since there is no data below 0.97R . However, at least some of the parameters can be\nconstrained: We start with the solar density, for which we perform a least squares fit to the Solar\nModel S using the following expression:\n\u0012\n\u0013m\nR\n\u03c1(r) \u223c\n\u2212\u03b3\n(18)\nr\nwe find that values of \u03b3 = 0.9665 and m = 1.911 fit the model best (see Figure 7-c).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nIn the second step we constrain the radial dependence of the stream function. We begin with\nthe function\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr \u2212 Rp a\n1\nF (r) = (r \u2212 Rp )(r \u2212 R ) sin \u03c0\n,\n(19)\nr\nR1 \u2212 Rp\n\nwhere R corresponds to the solar radius, Rp to the maximum penetration depth of the meridional\nflow and a and R1 control the location in radius of the poleward peak and the value of the meridional\nflow at the surface. In order to constrain them we use the helioseismic data again, but this time\nwe use the radial dependence (see Figure 7-a). We first remove the latitudinal dependence, which\nwe do by dividing the data of each latitude by G(\u03b8) using the value of q = 1 found in the previous\nsection. In Figure 7-b we plot the flow data after removing the latitudinal dependence, note that\nthere is no longer any sign difference between the two hemispheres. The next step is to generate the\nlatitudinal average which we can see as black dots in Figure 7-c. It is evident from looking at the\nradial dependence of the meridional flow that the velocity increases with depth for most latitudes,\nand that the point of maximum velocity is not within the depth up to which the data extends.\nSince the exact radial dependence of the data is too complex for our functional form to grasp,\nthe features we concentrate on reproducing are the presence of a maximum inside the convection\nzone, as well as the amplitude of the flow at the near surface-layers. The logic here is to use the\nfewest possible parameters and a simple, physically transparent profile that does a reasonable job\nof matching the data. In view of the lack of better constraints, we assume here that the peak of the\nreturn flow is at 0.97R (which is the depth at which the current helioseismic data has it's peak).\n\nFollowing the procedures and steps above we construct profiles to fit the depth-dependence\npointed out in the available helioseismic data; however, this does not constrain how far the meridional flow can penetrate and therefore we try two different penetration depths, one shallow 0.71R\n(i.e., barely beneath the base of the SCZ) and one deep Rp = 0.64R (into the radiative interior) \u2013\nboth of which match the latitudinal and radial constraints as deduced from the near-surface helioseismic data. Note that observed light element abundance ratios limit the depth of penetration of\nthe circulation to about Rp = 0.62R (Charbonneau 2007). Now we know that the meridional flow\nspeed is highly variable, with fluctuations that can be quite significant and the measured flow speed\ncan change depending on the phase of the solar cycle (Hathaway 1996; Gizon & Rempel 2008). The\nmagnetic fields are also expected to feed back on the flow (Rempel 2006). Taken together these\nconsiderations point out that the effective meridional flow speed to be used in dynamo simulations\ncould be less than that implied from the Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. data, a possibility that is borne\nout by the work of Braun & Fan (1998) and Gizon & Rempel (2008), who find much lower peak\nflow speeds in the range 12\u201315 m/s. Keeping this in mind, we use the same latitudinal and radial\nconstraint as deduced earlier, but consider in our simulations two additional profiles with peak flow\nspeeds of 12 m/s with deep and shallow penetrations. Therefore, in total we explore four plausible\nmeridional flow profiles in our dynamo simulations (see Figure 7-c and Table 1 for an overview),\nthe results of which are presented in the next section.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nvo\nSet\nSet\nSet\nSet\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n12\n22\n12\n22\n\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\n\nRp\n\na\n\nR1\n\n0.64R\n\n1.795\n\n1.027R\n\n0.71R\n\n2.03\n\n1.03R\n\nTable 1: Sets of parameters characterizing the different meridional flow profiles used in our dynamo\nsimulations. vo corresponds to the meridional flow peak speed, Rp the maximum penetration of\nthe flow, and a and R1 are parameters that control the location of the poleward flow as well as the\nsurface speed.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDynamo Simulation: Results and Discussions\n\nAnalytic vs. Helioseismic Composite Differential Rotation\n\nWe first compare dynamo solutions found using the helioseismology composite of the differential\nrotation (Section 3.1.1) and the analytical profile of Charbonneau et al. (1999). In doing so,\nwe perform simulations with a model as described in Section 2 (see also numerical methods in\nthe Appendix) and generate field evolution maps for the toroidal and poloidal fields. From the\nsimulated butterfly diagrams for the evolution of the toroidal field at the base of the SCZ and\nthe surface-radial field evolution (Figure 8), we find that large-scale features of the simulated solar\ncycle are generally similar across the two different rotation profiles (even with different meridional\nflow penetration depths and speeds), specially for the shallowest penetration (sets 3 and 4 with\nRp = 0.71R ).\nIn order to understand this similarity, it is useful to look at Figures 10 and 11 corresponding to\nsimulations using the composite differential rotation, and the meridional flow sets 1 (Rp = 0.64R ,\nvo = 12m/s) and 4 (Rp = 0.71R , vo = 22m/s). The first two columns, from left to right of\nboth figures show the evolution of the shear sources (Br * \u2207r \u03a9) and (B\u03b8 * \u2207\u03b8 \u03a9) \u2013 which contribute\nto toroidal field generation by stretching of the poloidal field. It is evident that the location and\nstrength of these sources is different \u2013 the radial shear source is mainly present near the surface\nwhereas the latitudinal shear is spread throughout the convection zone. It can also be seen that the\nradial shear source is roughly five times stronger than the latitudinal. However, if attention is paid\nto the evolution of the toroidal field (third column from the right in both figures), it is clear that\nthis radial shear term has no significant impact on the structure and magnitude of the toroidal field\n(a similar result was found by Dikpati et al. 2002). The reason is that the upper boundary condition\n(B = 0 at r = R ), in combination with the high turbulent diffusivity (and thus short diffusive\ntime scale) there, imposes itself very quickly on the toroidal field generated by the radial shear \u2013\nwashing it out. This greatly reduces the relative role of the surface shear as a source of toroidal\nmagnetic field, effectively making the surface dynamics very similar across simulations using the\nanalytical rotation profile (without any surface shear) or the composite helioseismic profile.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nOnce the surface layers are ruled out as important sources of toroidal field generation we are\nfaced with the fact that the strongest source of toroidal field is the latitudinal shear inside the\nconvection zone (and not the tachocline radial shear), as is evident in Figures 10 and 11. This\ngoes against the commonly held perception that the tachocline is where most of the toroidal field is\nproduced. However, the importance of the latitudinal shear term in the SCZ is clearly demonstrated\nhere where we have plotted the shear source terms, which is not normally done by dynamo modelers.\nThe establishment of the SCZ as an importance source region of toroidal field is of relevance\nwhen regarding the similarity of the solutions obtained using the composite data and the analytical\nprofile. This is because the region where the shear of the analytical profile and the helioseismic\ncomposite data differ most (both for radial and latitudinal shear) is in the tachocline. This is\nevident in Figure 9 where we plot the residual of subtracting the radial and latitudinal shear of\nthe analytical profile from the shear of the composite data. The similarity between solutions is\nspecially important for shallow meridional flow profiles with low penetration \u2013 which does not\ntransport any poloidal field into the deeper tachocline, thereby further diminishing the role of the\ntachocline shear.\n\n4.2.\n\nShallow versus Deep Penetration of the Meridional Flow\n\nIn the second part of our work we compare dynamo solutions obtained for each of the four\ndifferent meridional flow profiles with two different penetration depth and with two different peak\nflow speeds. First, from Figure 8 it is evident that the shape of the solutions changes with varying\npenetration depth; this is caused by the increasing role of the tachocline shear in generation and\nstorage of the toroidal field as the penetration depth of the meridional flow increases. This is\napparent when one compares Figure 10 (deep penetration) to Figure 11 (shallow penetration). If\nwe look at the inductive shear sources it is evident that for the shallowest penetration no field is\nbeing generated inside the tachocline. In the poloidal field plots (right column) we see that no\npoloidal field is advected into the tachocline region for the shallowest penetration, but some is\nadvected for the deepest.\nSecond we compare the periods of our solutions in Table 2: We find that most solutions have\na sunspot cycle (i.e., half-dynamo cycle) period that is comparable to that of the Sun, with the\nexception of the fast flow with deep penetration and the slow flow with shallow penetration, which\nhave respectively a comparatively smaller and larger period. As the meridional flow is buried\ndeeper, one expects the length of the advective circuit to increase, thereby resulting in larger\ndynamo periods. However, it is evident that as we increase the penetration, the period decreases\n\u2013 even if the length of the flow loop that supposedly transports magnetic flux increases; this is\ncounterintuitive but has a simple explanation. Our simulations and exhaustive analysis points out\nthat it is not how deep the flow penetrates that governs the cycle period, but it is the magnitude of\nthe meridional counterflow right at the base of the SCZ (Rp = 0.713R ) that is most relevant. This\nis because most of the poloidal field creation at near-surface layers is coupled to buoyant eruptions\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nof toroidal field from this layer of equatorward migrating toroidal field belt at the base of the SCZ\n(see third columns in Figures 10 and 11) and it is the flow speed at this region that governs the\ndynamo period. In Figure 7 it is clear that the speed of the counterflow in this convection zone\u2013\nradiative interior interface increases as the flow becomes more penetrating (a consequence of the\nconstraints set by mass conservation and the fits to the near-surface helioseismic data), thereby\nreducing the dynamo period.\nOverall, an evaluation of the butterfly diagram (Figure 8), points out that the toroidal field\nbelt extends to lower latitudes (where sunspots are observed) for deeper penetrating meridional\nflow, although there is a polar branch as well. For the shallow flow, we find that the toroidal field\nbelt is concentrated around mid-latitudes with almost symmetrical polar and equatorial branches\n\u2013 a signature of the convection zone latitudinal shear producing most of the toroidal field (as in\nthe interface dynamo models, see, e.g., Parker 1993 and Charbonneau & MacGregor 1997).\nRp\nSet\nSet\nSet\nSet\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n0.64R\n0.71R\n\nvo\n12\n22\n12\n22\n\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\n\n\u03c4 - HS data (yrs)\n\n\u03c4 - Analytical (yrs)\n\n9.67\n5.63\n14.67\n11.85\n\n10.00\n5.67\n14.02\n12.85\n\nTable 2: Simulated sunspot cycle period for the different sets of meridional flow parameters.

As can be seen in Figure 12, this introduces two important changes in the dynamo\nsolutions: The first one is an overall increase in magnetic field magnitude due to the reduction in\ndiffusive decay while keeping the strength of the field sources constant. The second is a drastic\nincrease in the dynamo period (which can be seen tabulated in Table 3) for the solutions that use a\nmeridional flow with a penetration of Rp = 0.71R . The reason behind such a change resides in the\nnature of the transport processes at the bottom of the convection zone, which are a combination of\nboth advection and diffusion. In the case of flow profiles with deep penetration the velocity at the\nbottom is high enough for downward advection to transport flux into the tachocline. On the other\nhand, in the case of low penetration, the last bit of downward transport into the tachocline is done\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nby diffusive transport and thus dominated by diffusive timescales. Because of this, by decreasing\nturbulent diffusivity by an order of magnitude, we drastically increase the period of the solutions.\nRp\nSet\nSet\nSet\nSet\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n0.64R\n0.71R\n\nvo\n12\n22\n12\n22\n\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\nm/s\n\n\u03c4 - HS data (yrs)\n\n\u03c4 - Analytical (yrs)\n\n12.46\n6.47\n87.78\n70.48\n\n12.86\n6.55\n90.92\n74.41\n\nTable 3: Simulated sunspot cycle period for the different sets of meridional flow parameters when\nusing a low diffusivity in the convection zone (\u03b7cz = 1010 cm2 /s). Rp corresponds to the maximum\npenetration depth of the meridional flow, vo to the peak speed in the poleward flow and \u03c4 is the\nperiod of the solutions in units of years.\nIn the second parameter space experiment, we lower the super-granular diffusivity \u03b7sg from\nto 1011 cm2 /s. This was done to study the impact of the surface radial shear under low\ndiffusivity conditions. However, as can be seen in Figure 13, there is very little difference between\nthe two solutions. This means that even after reducing the super-granular diffusivity by two orders\nof magnitude, the radial shear has very little impact on the solutions and the upper boundary\nconditions still play an important role in limiting the relative contribution from the near-surface\nshear layer.\n\n1013 cm2 /s\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn summary, we have presented here methods which can be used to better integrate helioseismic\ndata into kinematic dynamo models. In particular, we have demonstrated that using a composite\nbetween helioseismic data and an analytical profile for the differential rotation, we can directly use\nthe helioseismic rotation data in the region of trust and substitute the suspect data by smoothly\nmatching it to the analytical profile where the data is noisy. This paves the way for including the\nhelioseismically inferred rotation profile directly in dynamo simulations. We have also shown how\nmathematical properties of the commonly used analytic stream functions describing the meridional\nflow can be fit to the available near-surface helioseismic data to entirely constrain the latitudinal\ndependence of the meridional flow, as well as weakly constrain the radial (depth) dependence.\nIn our simulations, comparing the helioseismic data for the differential rotation with the analytical profile of Charbonneau et al. (1999), with four plausible meridional flow profiles, we find\nthat there is little difference between the solutions using the helioseismic composite and the analytical differential rotation profile \u2013 specially for shallow penetrations of the meridional flow and\neven at reduced super-granular diffusivity. This is because the impact of the surface radial shear,\nwhich is present in the helioseismic composite but not the analytic profile, is greatly reduced by\nthe proximity of the upper boundary conditions. Also, for the shallow circulation, the toroidal field\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ngeneration occurs in a region located above the tachocline with mainly latitudinal shear, where the\ndifference between the composite data and the analytical profile is not significant.\nThe main result from this comparative analysis is that the latitudinal shear in the rotation is\nthe most dominant source of toroidal field generation in these type of models that are characterized\nby high diffusivity at near surface layers, but lower diffusivity within the bulk of the SCZ \u2013 specially\nnear the base where most of the toroidal field is being created. Since this latitudinal shear exists\nthroughout the convection zone, an interesting question is whether toroidal fields can be stored there\nlong enough to be amplified to high values by the shear in the rotation, without being removed by\nmagnetic buoyancy. If this were to be the case, i.e., the latitudinal shear is indeed confirmed to be\nthe dominant source of toroidal field induction, we anticipate then that downward flux pumping\n(Tobias et al. 2001; see also Guerrero & de Gouveia Dal Pino 2008) \u2013 which tends to act against\nbuoyant removal of flux, may have an important role to play in this context. This could also call\ninto question the widely held view that the solar tachocline is where most of the toroidal field\nis created and stored (see Brandenburg 2005 for arguments favoring a more distributed dynamo\naction throughout the SCZ).\nOur attempts to integrate helioseismic meridional flow data into dynamo models and related\nsimulations have uncovered points that are both encouraging and discouraging.\nOn the discouraging side, we find that the currently available observational data are inadequate to constrain the nature and exact profile of the deep meridional flow, especially the return\nflow. Neither do the simulation results and their comparison with observed features of the solar\ncycle clearly support or rule out any possibility. A recent analysis on light-element depletion due\nto transport by meridional circulation indicates that solar light-element abundance observations\nrestrict the penetration to 0.62R (Charbonneau 2007); however this analysis does not necessarily\nsuggest that the flow does penetrate that deep. Also vexing is the fact that different inversions,\ninvolving different helioseismic techniques such as ring-diagram or time-distance analysis recovers\ndifferent profiles and widely varying peak meridional flow speeds (Giles et al. 1997; Braun & Fan\n1998; Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2006; Gizon & Rempel 2008). In our analysis, we chose to use\nthe Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. data because at present, this provides the (relatively) deepest full\ninversion of the flow within the SCZ. Chou and Ladenkov (2005) reported time-distance diagrams\nreaching a depth of 0.79R but have not yet reported a full inversion that could be used on our\nsimulations.\nWe point out that there is an important consequence of the presence of the flow speed maximum\ninside the convection zone \u2013 which is related to mass conservation: If the maximum poleward flow\nspeed is found to be deeper inside the convection zone this would result in a stronger mass flux\npoleward, which needs to be balanced by a deeper counterflow subject to mass conservation; the\ndensity of the plasma increases rapidly as one goes deeper; e.g., the density at 0.97R is ten\nthousand times larger than at the surface. Although that is not achieved currently, our extensive\nefforts to fit the data point out that stronger constraints on the return flow may be achieved even\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nwith data that does not necessarily go down to where this return flow is located, a fact that may be\nusefully utilized when better depth-dependent helioseismic data on meridional circulation becomes\navailable.\nAlthough the depth of penetration of the circulation is an important constraint on the flow\nitself, our results indicate that the period of of the dynamo cycle does not in fact depend on this\ndepth. Rather, our simulations point out that the period of the dynamo cycle is more sensitive to\nchanges on the speed of the counterflow than changes anywhere else in the transport circuit, as this\nis where the dynamo loop originates. An accurate determination of the average meridional flow\nspeed over this loop closing at the SCZ base is very important in the context of the field transport\ntimescales. As shown by the analysis of Yeates, Nandy & Mackay (2008), the relative timescales\nof circulation and turbulent diffusion determines whether the dynamo operates in the advection or\ndiffusion dominated regime \u2013 two regimes which have profoundly different flux transport dynamics\nand cycle memory (the latter may lead to predictability of future cycle amplitudes). Getting a firm\nhandle on the average meridional flow speed is therefore very important and that is not currently\nachieved from the diverging helioseismic inversion results on the meridional flow.\nThis suggests that a concerted effort using different helioseismic techniques on data for the\nmeridional flow over at least a complete solar cycle (over the same period of time) may be necessary to generate a more coherent picture of the observational constraint on this flow profile. It's\nimportant to note that even though we used time averaged data, nothing prevents one from using\nthe same methods to assimilate time dependent helioseismic data at different phases of the solar\ncircle, allowing us to study the impact of time varying velocity flows on solar cycle properties and\ntheir predictability.\nOn the encouraging side, our dynamo simulations show that it is relatively straightforward to\nuse the available helioseismic data on the differential rotation (on which there is more consensus\nand agreement across various groups) within dynamo models. Also encouraging is the fact that\nthe type of solar dynamo model presented here is able to handle the real helioseismic differential\nrotation profile and generate solar-like solutions. Moreover, as evident from our simulations, this\ndynamo model also generates plausible solar-like solutions over a wide range of meridional flow\nprofiles, both deep and shallow, and with fast and slow peak flow speeds. This certainly bodes well\nfor assimilating helioseismic data to construct better constrained solar dynamo models \u2013 building\nupon the techniques outlined here.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Irene Gonz\u00e1lez-Hern\u00e1ndez and Rachel Howe at the National Solar Observatory for providing us with helioseismic data and useful counsel regarding it's use.

Provided that the Jacobian \u2202F (U(t)) exists and is continuous\nin the interval [t0 , t0 + \u2206t], we can linearize F (U(t0 + \u2206t)) around the initial state to obtain\n\u2202U(t)\n= F (U0 ) + \u2202F (U0 )(U(t0 + \u2206t) \u2212 U0 ) + R(U(t0 + \u2206t))\n\u2202t\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere R(U(t0 + \u2206t) are the residual high order terms.

Neglecting higher order terms leaves us with a scheme that is second order\naccurate in time and is an exact solution of the linear case. However there is a way of increasing the\ntime accuracy of this method by following a generalization of Runge-Kutta methods for non-linear\ntime-advancement operators proposed by Rosenbrock (1963). The combination of exponential\npropagation with Runge-Kutta methods was first proposed by Hochbruck and Lubich (1997) and\nthen generalized by Hochbruck, Lubich and Selhofer (1998).

However, it is possible to make a good\napproximation by projecting the operator into a finite dimensional Krylov subspace\nSKr = span{U0 , AU0 , A2 U0 , ..., Am\u22121 U0 }.\n\n(A8)\n\nIn order to do this we first compute an orthonormal basis for this subspace using the Arnoldi\nalgorithm (Arnoldi 1951):\n1. v1 = U0 /|U0 |2\n2. For j = 1, ..., m do\n\u2022 for i = 1, ..., i compute hi,j = viT \u2217 Avj\n\u2022 calculate w = Avj \u2212\n\nj\nX\n\nhi,j vi\n\ni=0\n\n\u2022 evaluate h( j + 1, j) = |w|2\n\n\u2022 if hj+1,j < \u000f stop, else compute the next basis vector vj+1 = w/hj+1,j\n\nwhere \u000f is the parameter that sets the error tolerance in this approximation. Once we have finished\ncomputing the algorithm, we have the relationship\nAVm \u2248 Vm H,\n\n(A9)\n\nwhere Vm = [v1 , ..., vm ] and H is a matrix whose elements are hi,j = viT \u2217 Avj . The validity of\nthis approximation depends on the dimension of the Krylov subspace but numerical experiments\nhave found that 15-30 Krylov vectors are usually enough (see Hochbruck and Lubich 1997; Tokman\n2001). Since {v1 , ..., vm } is an orthonormal basis of the Krylov subspace SKr then VmT VM is a m\u00d7m\nidentity matrix and Vm VmT is a projector from RN onto SKr . Using this projector we can find an\napproximation to any matrix vector multiplication by projecting them onto the Krylov subspace\nby calculating Ab \u2248 Vm VmT AVm VmT b. After using Equation A9 this becomes\nAb \u2248 Vm HVmT b.\n\n(A10)\n\nIn fact we can approximate the action of any operator \u03a6(A), that can be expanded on a Taylor\nseries, on the vector U0 using the Krylov subspace projection:\n\u03a6(A)U0 \u2248 Vm \u03a6(H)VmT U0 = |U0 |2 Vm \u03a6(H)e1\n\n(A11)\n\nwhere e1 = [1 0 ... 0] and we used v1 = U0 /|U0 |2 and VmT v1 = e1 . As we can see in Equation A11,\nthe use of the Krylov approximation effectively reduces the size of the matrix operator; this makes\nthe use of the exponential operator relatively inexpensive computationally.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nThese two algorithms, in combination with a robust error control and an adaptative time-step\nmechanism strategy, form the core of the SD-Exp4 integrator (for more details see Hochbruck and\nLubich 1997; Hochbruck, Lubich and Selhofer 1998 and Tokman 2001).\nIn order to verify the performance standards of the SD-Exp4 code we ran case C' of the dynamo\nbenchmark by Jouve et al. (2008). This case is similar in nature to the simulations done in this\nwork with the following differences:\n\u2022 The meridional flow profile has different radial and latitudinal dependence.\n\u2022 The poloidal source term has no quenching term and a different radial and latitudinal dependence.\n\u2022 The turbulent diffusivity profile consists of only one step and reaches a peak value of 1011\ncm2 /s.\n\u2022 The analytic differential rotation has no cos4 (\u03b8) dependence and uses a thinner tachocline.\nIn order to compare the performance of the different codes in the benchmark study, two\nquantities are used: Cscrit = \u03b10crit R /\u03b7cz which quantifies the minimum strength of the sourcerelative-to-dissipation that yields stable oscillations and \u03c9 = 2\u03c0R2 /(T \u03b7cz ) which quantifies the\nfrequency of the magnetic cycle relative to the diffusion timescale. The dependence of this quantities\nis then plotted versus resolution for all the different codes (see Figure 11 of Jouve et al. 2008). In\norder to compare our code, we perform simulations with the same parameters and model ingredients\nas in case C' of Jouve et al. (2008) and plot this two quantities versus resolution. We also plot\nthe location of the mean found by the other codes and a shaded area encompassing one standard\ndeviation around the mean. As can be seen in Figure 14, we find lower values of Cscrit than the\nvalues obtained in Jouve et al. 2008 (1.86 as opposed to an average 2.46) for oscillatory solutions;\nthis may be due to a lower amount of numerical diffusion in our code. Moreover, we find values of\n\u03c9 in very good agreement with those found in Jouve et al. 2008 (540 as opposed to an average of\n538.2). We also find that for our code this quantities are less sensitive to resolution when compared\nto other codes used in the benchmark. This is likely due to the fact that we try to avoid numerical\ndifferentiation whenever we can do it analytically.\nAs a final remark, Table 4 of Jouve et al. 2008 specifies the different time steps that are used\nby the different codes, which range from values of 10\u22128 to 10\u22125 code time units. Thanks to the use\nof Krylov approximations we are able to use time steps as large as 10\u22122 in code time units while\nsolving Case C'. However, this does not translate to a performance improvement of several orders\nof magnitude (due to the added computations in the Krylov approximation). In order to quantify\nthe relative performance improvement, we also made comparisons with the Surya code, which has\nbeen studied extensively in different contexts (e.g. Nandy & Choudhuri 2002, Chatterjee, Nandy\n& Choudhuri 2004, Choudhuri, Chatterjee & Jiang 2007), and is made available to the public on\nrequest. In comparison to the Surya code, we find that the SD-Exp4 code achieves a performance\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nimprovement that reduces runtime from a half to a tenth of the total runtime depending on the\nparticularities of the simulation.\n\nREFERENCES\nArnoldi, W.
