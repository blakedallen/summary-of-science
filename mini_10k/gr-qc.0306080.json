Introduction\nIn the early sixties Mandelstam [1] proposed a new formalism for electrodynamics and\ngravitation in which the fields depend on the paths rather than on space-time points.\nThe fundamental quantity that arises from this path-dependent approach, the nonintegrable phase factor[2] (loop variable) represents the field more adequately than\nthe field strength does. In the application of this formalism in the theory of gravity,\nMandelstam[1] established several equations involving the loop variables. Some years\nlater Voronov and Makeenko[3] showed the equivalence between the equations obtained\nusing this approach and Einstein's equations.\nThe quantities we intend to use are the gravitational loop variables and\ncorresponding holonomies of the Christoffel connection or of the spin connection.\nKeeping the local fields as the fundamental dynamical variables, we shall compute\nthe loop variables in different cases in order to learn about their behavior and their\ngeometrical meaning.\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\n2\n\nThe loop variables in the theory of gravity are matrices representing parallel\ntransport along paths in a space-time with a given affine connection. They are defined\nas the limit of an ordered product of matrices of infinitesimal parallel transport as\nU\u03bd\u03bc (Cyx ; \u0393) \u2261\n\nN\nY\n\ni=1\n\ni\n(\u03b4\u03c1\u03c11\u2212i\n\u2212 \u0393\u03c1\u03bbii \u03c11\u2212i (xi )dx\u03bbi i ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x0 = x, \u03c1o = \u03bd, xN = y, \u03c1N = \u03bc, dxi = (xi \u2212 xi\u22121 )/\u03b5.\nThe points xi lie on an oriented curve Cyx with its beginning at the point x and its\nend at the point y. The parallel-transport matrix U\u03bd\u03bc is a functional of the curve Cyx as\na geometrical object.\nIf we choose as tetrad frame, a basis {eab (x)} and a loop C such that C(0) =\nC(1) = x, then in parallel transporting a vector X \u03b1 from C(\u03bb) to C(\u03bb + d\u03bb), the vector\ncomponents change by\n\u03b4X \u03bc = M\u03bd\u03bc [x(\u03bb)] X \u03bd d\u03bb,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M\u03bd\u03bc is an infinitesimal linear map which depends on the tetrads, on the affine\nconnection of the space-time and on the value of \u03bb. Therefore, the linear map takes any\ntangent vector to C in a given point and parallel transport it along C back to the initial\npoint. Then, it follows that the holonomy transformation U\u03bd\u03bc is given by the matrix\nproduct of the N linear maps\nU\u03bd\u03bc\n\n= lim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n\u221e \u0014\nY\n\n\u03b4\u03bd\u03bc\n\ni=1\n\n1\n+ M\u03bd\u03bc [x(\u03bb)] |\u03bb= i .\nN\nN\n\u0015\n\n(3)\n\nOne often writes the linear map U\u03bd\u03bc given by Eq.(3) as\n\uf8eb\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f6\n\nU(C) = P exp \uf8ed M \uf8f8 ,\n\n(4)\n\nC\n\nwhere P means ordered product along a curve C. Equation (4) should be understood\nas an abbreviation of the right hand side of eq.(3). Note that if M\u03bd\u03bc is independent\nof \u03bb, then it follows from eq.(3) that U\u03bd\u03bc is given by U\u03bd\u03bc = (exp M)\u03bc\u03bd . The linear map\nU\u03bd\u03bc is called holonomy transformation associated with the curve C. From eq.(4) we can\nconstruct the invariants which involve the holonomy group. This group measures the\ndeviation of the space from global flatness. The basic invariant associated with U(C) is\nthe trace of U(C). This quantity provides information about the geometric and physical\nstructure of the space-time. In this paper we shall use the following notation\n\uf8eb\n\nUAB (C) = P exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\nZA\n\nB\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0393\u03bc (x(\u03bb))\n\n\uf8f6\n\ndx\nd\u03bb\uf8f8 ,\nd\u03bb\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u0393\u03bc is the tetradic connection and A and B are the initial and final points of\nthe path. Then, associated with every path C from a point A to a point B, we have a\nloop variable UAB given by eq.(5) which, by construction, is a function of the path C as\na geometrical object. Using holonomy, Bollini, Giambiagi and Tiomno[4] investigated\nthe Kerr black holes space-times and obtained many properties of this geometry. In\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\n3\n\na recent article, Rothman, Ellis and Murugan [5] investigated the holonomy in the\nDrost-Schwarzschild geometry obtaining very interesting results for a class orbits in this\nspace-time. They found that holonomy in this space-time has a \"quantization\" property\ndenominated band invariance holonomy. Those results can be used for the investigation\nof strong-gravity effects [6] in the X-ray emission from a few acreting galactic black holes\nand neutron star. Their results can be used for the study of the Einstein-PodolskiRosen experiment in a curved background [7]. In a recent article the clock effects\nwere investigated by Bini, Jantzen and Mashhoon[8], via holonomy transformation.\nBurgers[9] and Bezerra[10] examined the effects of a parallel transport of vectors and\nspinors both around a point-like solution and a cylindrically symmetric cosmic string.\nThis procedure gives, in general, non-trivial results. These effects point out to the\ngravitational analogue Aharonov-Bohm effect. Two of us (CF and FM)[11] investigated\nby holonomy transformation, the topological properties of a class of solutions in KaluzaKlein theory and demonstrated that the holonomy gives a combined effect of gravitation\nand electromagnetic fields in the parallel transport of vectors in that space-time. This\ncombined the electromagnetic and gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effects. The analysis\nof Berry's quantum phase in gravitation[12] was studied in a recent article. The use of\nholonomy for quantum computation was analyzed in a geometric approach by Pachos\nand Zanardi[13].\n2. The Geometry of a Black String\nBlack holes constitute one of the most fascinating structures of nature. They have\nbeen extensively studied in a wide variety of models. Recently, Ba\u00f1ados, Teitelboim\nand Zanelli[14, 15] obtained a (2 + 1)-dimensional solution of Einstein's field equations\nwith negative cosmological constant, called BTZ black hole. Several authors have\nused gauge formulation of gravity in (2+1) dimensions for a description the BTZ\nsolution[16, 17], they have demonstrated that Wilson loops in the three dimensional\nAnti-de Sitter group SO(2,2) reproduce the BTZ geometry. This solution is very\nimportant to the study of many aspects of black hole quantum physics, thermodynamics\nand other general properties. String-like configuration of black holes have been studied\nin recent years[18, 19], this object can be seen with a foliation of tridimensional objects.\nMore recently, Lemos and Zanchin[20] transformed the (2 + 1) BTZ black hole into\na (3 + 1) cylindrical black hole, known as a black string. This process is similar to\nthe transformation of a punctual particle in (2 + 1) dimensions into a straight cosmic\nstring in four-dimensional space-time. This spacetime is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter\nin the radial direction and non-asymptotically flat. Its geometric structure is that of\nthe BTZ black hole extended with a flat line which is interpreted as the string axis. Its\nasymptotic symmetry group is R times the conformal group in two dimensions of which\nR \u00d7 SO(2, 2) is a subgroup.\nWe intend to use the gravitational loop variable and corresponding holonomy of the\nspin connection to describe the geometry of the space-time of a black string. The study\n\n\f4\n\nLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\nof this holonomy permits us to investigate the global properties of this space-time. The\naim of this paper is to investigate the holonomy for a class of orbits in the black string\ngeometry.\nThe line element of a black string space-time may be written as [20]\n\u0010\n\nds2 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + N \u22122 dr 2 + r 2 N \u03c6 dt + d\u03c6\n\n\u00112\n\n+ dz 2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nN and N \u03c6 are called lapse and angular shift functions and are given respectively by\n16J 2\n,\nr2\n\nN 2 (r) = \u2212 8M + \u03b12 r 2 +\n\n(7)\n\n4J\n,\n(8)\nr2\nwhere M is a term associated with the mass, J, the angular momentum term and\n\u03b1 is associated with the cosmological constant, \u039b, more precisely, \u039b = \u2212\u03b12 . The nonrotational case is gotten when we make the angular momentum null, J = 0. Introducing\nan appropriate dual 1-form basis(co-frame), defined by ea = ea\u03bc dx\u03bc , where\nN \u03c6 (r) = \u2212\n\ne0 = Ndt,\n\n(9)\n\ne1 = N \u22121 dr,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03c6\n\n2\n\ne = r(N dt + d\u03c6),\n\n(11)\n\n3\n\ne = dz,\n\n(12)\n\nthe 1-form connections are obtained from the first of the Maurer-Cartan structure\nequations: dea + \u03c9ba \u2227 eb = 0. From the above basis we find the following connections:\n\u03c910 = \u03c901 = NN \u2032 dt,\n\n\u03c921\n\n= \u2212\n\n\u03c912\n\n(13)\n\u03c6\n\n= \u2212N(N dt + d\u03c6).\n\n(14)\n\nThis result takes us to the following spin connection for the black string metric\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\n\u0393\u03c6 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0\n0 0\n\uf8f7\n0 0 \u2212N 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n0 N\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 0\n0 0\n\n(15)\n\nThis result is the same obtained when we consider a non-rotating black string. Also\n\n\u0393t =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\nNN \u2032\n0\n\u2032\nNN\n0\n\u2212NN \u03c6\n0\nNN \u03c6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(16)\n\nWhen we make N \u03c6 = 0, this result is reduced to the non-rotating black string case. The\nspin connection \u0393\u03c6 corresponds to closed curves with constant time, while \u0393t corresponds\nto closed curves with constant azimuthal angle. The holonomy matrix associated with\nthe parallel transport of vectors around closed curves \u03b3 is defined by\n\u0012\n\nU(\u03b3) = P exp \u2212\n\nI\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u0393\u03bc dx\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\n5\n\nwhere the P is the order operator.\nWe are interested in analyzing closed paths around a black string. First, we will\nstudy closed curves with constant time and centered at the origin. As \u0393\u03c6 is independent\nof the azimuthal angle \u03c6, then the holonomy integral (17), can easily be calculated\n\u0012\n\nU(\u03b3) = exp \u2212\n\nI\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0393\u03c6 d\u03c6 ,\n\n= exp (\u22122\u03c0\u0393\u03c6 ) .\n\n(18)\n\nMaking the expansion of this equation and noticing that we are always able to write the\nexponents of upper order in \u0393\u03c6 and \u03932\u03c6 terms. Then eq. (18) can be written in compact\nform in the following way:\n\u03932\u03c6\n\u0393\u03c6\nsin(2\u03c0N) + 2 [1 \u2212 cos(2\u03c0N)] .\n(19)\nU(\u03b3) = 1 \u2212\nN\nN\nThe above expression corresponds to the holonomy transformation for a circular path\nwith constant time.\nWe observe that these holonomy transformations have the same property analyzed\nby Ellis and coworkers in Schwarchild case, the band holonomy invariance. Note that\nafter n loops in the afore mentioned path we observe that if 2\u03c0nN = 2\u03c0m there exists\na critical radius, rcr , given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(20)\nR = 2 8M + (m/n) \u00b1 (8M + (m/n) ) \u2212 (8\u03b1J) ,\n2\u03b1\nwhere the holonomy is trivial and we obtain a behavior similar to the observed in\nSchwarzschild case. For this case the holonomy matrix is trivial and the transported\nvector does not acquire a deficit angle in this transport.\nWriting the holonomy in a matrix form, we set\n\nU(\u03b3) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0 cos(2\u03c0N) sin(2\u03c0N) 0\n0 \u2212 sin(2\u03c0N) cos(2\u03c0N) 0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(21)\n\nThis matrix can be interpreted as the rotation generator around the z-axis, since\nU(\u03b3) = exp(\u22122\u03c0iNJ12 ). We can get a quantization condition by imposing that nN = m,\nwhere m is an integer. For these values the holonomy matrix is equal the identity matrix.\nThe deficit angle \u03c7 obtained when we compare the final and initial position of the\nparallel transported vector is given by\ncos \u03c7A = UAA ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere A is a tetradic index. The terms of non vanishing angular deviations occur when\nA = 1 and 2, so we have\ncos \u03c71or2 = cos(2\u03c0N)\n\n(23)\n\n|\u03c71or2 | = |2\u03c0N + 2\u03c0n|.\n\n(24)\n\nor\n\n\f6\n\nLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\nFor N \u2192 0 we must have \u03c71or2 \u2192 0, so we choose n = 0, which leads to\n|\u03c71or2 | = |2\u03c0N|.\n\n(25)\n\nThe above expression shows that for N 6= 0, if we parallel transport a vector around\na closed path the final vector does not coincide with the original vector. This physical\neffect could be understood as a gravitational analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.\nWe saw in (25) that there will be no Aharonov-Bohm effect if 2\u03c0N is an integer. This\nconditions is not always satisfied, because N is not necessarily an integer. In fact, it can\nassume an arbitrary value. There are similarities of this effect with the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect in the cosmic string case [10]. The crucial difference occurs in the fact that the\nspacetime exterior to the cosmic string has Riemann tensor null contrary to the black\nstring case that has constant curvature in the exterior region.\nThe natural way to construct an invariant quantity under a gauge transformation\nis determining the Wilson loop. The corresponding Wilson loop for a closed path \u03b3 is\ndefined by\n\u0014\n\nW (\u03b3) = trP exp \u2212\n\nI\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0015\n\ndx \u0393\u03bc (x) .\n\n\u03b3\n\n(26)\n\nAshtekar [21] \"rebuild\" general relativity as a \"loop representation\". In this formalism\nthe fundamental variables are the holonomies instead of the metrics. This approach\nallowed advances in the direction of a quantum theory of gravity. For a closed path\nwith constant time the Wilson loop is given by\nW (\u03b3) = 2 (1 + cos 2\u03c0N) .\n\n(27)\n\nNote that the Wilson loop is trivial for the same values were occurs the band holonomy\ninvariance 2\u03c0nN = 2\u03c0m. In this way, we can use the Wilson loop to investigate the\nband holonomy invariance.\nAnother path can be obtained by fixing the azimuthal angle,\n\u0012\n\nU(\u03b3) = exp \u2212\n\nI\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0393t dt\n\n= exp (\u2212T \u0393t ) ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhich leads to the following expression for the phase (17)\nq\n\u0393t\nq\nsinh( (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T ) +\nU(\u03b3) = 1 \u2212\n(NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2\n\nq\n\u03932t\ncosh(\n(NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T ) \u2212 1 .\n(29)\n(NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2\nIn this case, we note that the holonomy carries information about the term associated\nwith the cosmological constant. Now writing U(\u03b3) in its matrix form we obtain,\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nU(\u03b3) =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nq\n\ncosh( (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T )\nq\n\n\u2212 sinh( (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T )\n0\n0\n\nq\n\n\u2212 sinh( (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T ) 0 0\nq\n\ncosh( (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 T )\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(30)\n\uf8f7.\n1 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 1\n\n\f7\n\nLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\nWe identify (NN \u2032 )2 \u2212 (NN \u03c6 )2 )T as the \"boost\" parameter in a Lorentz transformation.\nThe Wilson loop for a closed path with constant azimuthal angle is given by\n\u0012\n\nW (\u03b3) = 2 1 + cosh(\n\nq\n\n(NN \u2032 )2\n\n\u2212\n\n(NN \u03c6 )2 T )\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nThe Wilson loop has drawn considerable attention because it is a gauge-invariant\nquantity and because it can act as a dynamical variable. It is therefore interesting to\nobtain the Wilson loop and to verify the relations it obeys for the case studied here.\nMandelstam has proved that the loop variables satisfies a series of relations. Our interest\nis now in the proof of this relation for the black string case. Now, we use the curvature 2form, Rba , in order to verify the Mandelstam relations. Rba = d\u03c9ba +\u03c9ca \u2227\u03c9bc . This equation\nis called the second Maurer-Cartan structure equation. In this way the curvature matrix\nfor a constant time curve can be evaluated as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\n0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n0\nN\u2032 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\nR12 = \uf8ec\n(32)\n\uf8ec\n\u2032\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 \u2212N\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n0 0\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the variable r. The Mandelstam\nrelation is given by\nI\ndy \u03bc\n\u2202W\n= dST r [R\u03bd\u03bc U(\u03b3)]\n.\n(33)\n\u2202x\u03bd\ndS\nThis relation appears in the quantum gravitation loop variable theory. But,\n\u2202W\n= \u22124\u03c0N \u2032 sin(2\u03c0N),\n(34)\n\u2202r\nthen, it follows that\nZ\n\u2202W\n= T r[R21 U(\u03b3)]d\u03c6.\n(35)\n\u2202r\nNotice that the Mandelstam relations must be satisfied by the loop variables in a\nnonperturbative approach to the quantization of gravity [1]. In this work we have\nshown that they are obeyed classically as well.\nNow we consider a more general path in this geometry that performs a helix in\nspace-time. In this trajectory only the radial coordinate is maintained constant. We\nchoose a more general path now, where \u0393\u03bc = \u0393t dt + \u0393\u03c6 d\u03c6, In this case the holonomy is\ngiven by\n\u0012\n\nUG (\u03b3) = exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0n\n\n\u0013\n\n(\u03b2\u0393t + \u0393\u03c6 ) d\u03c6.\n\n(36)\n\nExpanding the above exponential, we get\n(2\u03c0\u0393s )2 (2\u03c0\u0393s )3\n+\n+ * * *,\nUG (\u03b3) = 1 \u2212 2\u03c0r\u0393s +\n2!\n3!\nwhere \u0393s = \u03b2\u0393t + \u0393\u03c6 .

The loop variable for general\ntrajectories encircling the defects can be written in the following form\n\u001a Z\n\nU = exp i\n\n2\u03c0n\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u001b\n\n(\u03b2NN J01 + \u03b2N(N + 1)J12 )d\u03c6 ,\n\n0\n\n(39)\n\nwhere J01 and J12 are the generators of the R \u00d7 SO(2, 2) group, in this way it is possible\nto describe the holonomy in this space-time in the general way in function of generators\nof the symmetry group\nU(\u03b3) = P exp{\u2212i\n\nZ\n\nc\n\n\u03bc\n\u0393ab\n\u03bc Jab dx }.\n\n(40)\n\nWe return to the matrix U(\u03b3), regrouping the terms of the exponents odd and evens\nwe can write the general holonomy as being\n\u03932\n\u0393s\nsin(2\u03c0n\u03c9) + s2 (cos(2\u03c0n\u03c9) \u2212 1) ,\n(41)\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nwere we consider that 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0n. In this way the band invariance holonomy can\nargued for some special orbit. Since \u03c9 > 0 we have oscillatory solutions. In the next\nsection we use the transport equation to examine this special orbit.\nUG (\u03b3) = 1 \u2212\n\n3. Study of some Special Orbits\nRecently, Rothman, Ellis and Murugan [5] studied some particular curves when a vector\nA is parallel transported in the geometry of Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6n and then observed\nvery interesting properties of parallel transport that they denominated invariance band\nholonomy. In this section we analyze the band holonomy properties from the point of\nview of the parallel transport equation in the background of the rotating black string.\nFirst we consider the general case of a circular orbit, and then we study the constant\ntime orbit and circular geodesics. The components of the vector A satisfy the equation\ndA\u03bc + \u03c9\u03b2\u03bc A\u03b2 = 0,\n\n(42)\n\nwhich is the parallel transport equation for the connection \u03c9\u03b2\u03bc . For the black string\nmetric (6), the components of the vector obey the following equations\ndA0 + NN \u2032 dtA1 = 0,\n\n(43)\n\ndA1 + NN \u2032 dtA0 \u2212 N(N \u03c6 dt + d\u03c6)A2 = 0,\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\ndA + N(N dt + d\u03c6)A = 0,\n3\n\ndA = 0.\n\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n\nNow we study a family of particular solutions of the above differential equations system.\nThe first particular solution corresponds to circular orbits, r = R, so we have a tangent\nvector like X \u03bc = (X t , 0, X \u03c6 , 0). In addition to this we parametrize the curve assuming\nthat the 'velocity' is constant; i.e, \u03b2 = dt/d\u03c6, so we find\ndA0\n+ \u03b2NN \u2032 A1 = 0,\nd\u03c6\n\n(47)\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\ndA1\n+ \u03b2NN \u2032 A0 \u2212 N(N \u03c6 \u03b2 + 1)A2 = 0,\nd\u03c6\ndA2\n+ N(N \u03c6 \u03b2 + 1)A1 = 0,\nd\u03c6\ndA3\n= 0.\nd\u03c6\nThese equations can be easily integrated to\n\u03b2NN \u2032 c2\n\u03b2NN \u2032 c1\ncos(\u03c9\u03c6) \u2212\nsin(\u03c9\u03c6) + c3 ,\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nA1 (\u03c6) = c1 sin(\u03c9\u03c6) + c2 cos(\u03c9\u03c6),\nN(N \u03c6 \u03b2 + 1)c1\nN(N \u03c6 \u03b2 + 1)c2\nA2 (\u03c6) =\ncos(\u03c9\u03c6) \u2212\nsin(\u03c9\u03c6) + c4 .\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nwith the 'angular frequency' \u03c9 given by\nA0 (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c9 2 = N 2 (N \u03c6 \u03b2 + 1)2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 N 2 N \u20322 .\n\n9\n(48)\n(49)\n(50)\n\n(51)\n(52)\n(53)\n\n(54)\n\nc1 , c2 , c3 , c4 are constants of integration. The constants c3 and c4 are not independent.\nSubstituting the solutions back into the differential equations system we see that:\n\u221a\nc4 = (R\u03b12 \u03b2/ \u22128M + R2 \u03b12 )c3 . We can also analize the orbit of constant time. The\ncomponents of vector A satisfy\ndA1\n\u2212 NA2 = 0,\n(55)\nd\u03c6\ndA2\n+ NA1 = 0.\n(56)\nd\u03c6\nWe assume that the orbits begin in \u03c6 = 0 and that after n laps, we have \u03c6 = 2\u03c0n. We\nalso assume that A0 = \u03b3 and A3 =constant. The other components are easily integrated\nto\nA1 (2\u03c0n) = c1 sin(N2\u03c0n) + c2 cos(N2\u03c0n),\n\n(57)\n\nA2 (2\u03c0n) = c1 cos(N2\u03c0n) \u2212 c2 sin(N2\u03c0n).\n\n(58)\n\nFor finite\nq r there is a deficit angle when the vector is parallel transported by 2\u03c0, except\n2\nwhen n \u22128M + \u03b12 r 2 + 16J\nequals an integer. The quantization condition of the orbits\nr2\nfor holonomy invariance implies that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(59)\nR = 2 8M + (m/n) \u00b1 (8M + (m/n) ) \u2212 (8\u03b1J) ,\n2\u03b1\nwhere m is a non-zero integer. The above expression shows that for geodesic motion\nalong curves with constant time in the background of a black string the holonomy\ninvariance occurs after n loops.\nAnother kind\n\u0010 of curve to be studied\n\u0011 are the time-like circles, whose tangent vector is\na\n\u03c6\ngiven by X = N\u03b2, 0, r(N \u03b2 + 1), 0 . For time-like curves the N 2 \u03b2 2 \u2212r 2 (N \u03c6 \u03b2 +1)2 < 0\ncondition is required.

In this case we can take the\ntangent vector as X \u03bc = [X t , X r , 0, 0], so we can write for the tetrad components\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nX a = NX t , N \u22121 X r , 0, 0 ,\n\n(63)\n\nFor simplicity, we choose radial null geodesics. This condition is satisfied if and only if\nN 2 (X t )2 = N \u22122 (X r )2 . Setting the curve parameter as r, the set of differential equations\n(43) and (44) reduces to\ndA0\n+ N \u2032 N \u22121 A1 = 0,\ndr\ndA1\n+ N \u2032 N \u22121 A0 = 0.\ndr\nThe general solution for this system is given by\n\n(64)\n(65)\n\nA0 = c1 N \u22121 + c2 N,\n\n(66)\n\nA1 = c1 N \u22121 \u2212 c2 N,\n\n(67)\n\nwhere c1 and c2 are integration constants.

Spinorial Parallel Transport\nIn this section we are interested in the study of parallel transport of spinor in the\ngeometry of the rotating black string. An important question that emerges when we\nstudy the parallel transport of vectors is what happens with more complex fields when\nthey also undergo a parallel transport. We know that vectors in a curved space-time\nmay be changed after a complete loop if there is a non-vanishing curvature in the region\nsurrounded by the loop. So, we are interested in understanding what comes about when\nspinors are parallel transported in the geometry of a black string. Spinors provide a\nlinear representation of the group of rotations in n-dimensional space.\n\n\f11\n\nLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\nThe covariant differentiation \u2207\u03bc of a spinor is defined in terms of the spinor\nconnection, \u0393\u03bc ,\n\u2207\u03bc \u03c8 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u0393\u03bc \u03c8.\n\n(71)\n\nThe spinor connection is given in terms of the Dirac matrices \u03b3\u03b1 ,\n1 \u03b1\n\u0393\u03bc = \u2212 \u03c9\u03bd\u03bc\n\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bd .\n(72)\n4\nFor orbits with constant time we found the following expression for the spin\nconnection in terms of the Paulis spin matrices\n1\n(73)\n\u0393\u03c6 d\u03c6 = \u2212 Ni\u03c33 d\u03c6.\n2\nThe phase associated with the above spinor connection is given by\n\u0012\n\nU(\u03b3) = exp \u2212\n\nI\n\n\u0393\u03c6 d\u03c6\n\n= exp (\u22122\u03c0\u0393\u03c6 ) ,\n\n\u0013\n\n(74)\n\nexpanding this term we obtain\nU(\u03b3) = cos(\u03c0N) \u2212 i\u03c33 sin(\u03c0N).\n\n(75)\n\nFor orbits with constant azimuthal angle, the unique non-null term is\n1 \u2202N 1 1\n\u0393t = N\n\u03c3 \u2212 NN \u03c6 i\u03c3 3 .\n(76)\n2 \u2202r\n2\nThe expression for the holonomy is obtained in a similar way of previous cases, and the\nmatrix of temporal holonomy is given by\nU(\u03b3) = 1 \u2212\n\n\u0393t\n[N 2 ( 12 [N \u03c6\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\nN \u2032 2 ])] 2\n\ns\n\n1\nsinh{ N 2 ( [N \u03c6 \u2212 N \u2032 2 ])T }\n2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n(77)\n\uf8f9\n\ns\n\n1\n\u03932\n\uf8f0cosh{ N 2 ( [N \u03c6 \u2212 N \u2032 2 ])T } \u2212 1\uf8fb .\n+ 2 1 \u03c6t\n2\n2\n[N ( 2 [N \u2212 N \u2032 ])]\n\nFor a non-rotating black string we have the following holonomy matrix\nU(\u03b3) = 1 \u2212\n\ni\n\u0393t\n\u03932t h\n2\n2\ncosh(r\u03b1\nT\n/2)\n\u2212\n1\n,\nsinh(r\u03b1\nT\n/2)\n+\nr\u03b12 /2\nr 2 \u03b14 /4\n\n(78)\n\nwhich leads to the following matrix representation\nU(\u03b3) =\nIt follows that\n\ncosh r\u03b12 T /2 \u2212 sinh r\u03b12 T /2\n\u2212 sinh r\u03b12 T /2 cosh r\u03b12 T /2\n\nW (\u03b3) = 2 cosh(r\u03b12T /2).\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(79)\n\n(80)\n\nFinally we investigate the most general paths in spinor parallel transport in the\nbackground of the black string. The spinorial connection is considered with \u0393s =\n\u03b2\u0393t + \u0393\u03c6 where the connection is given by\ni\n1\n(81)\n\u0393s = \u03b2NN \u2032 \u03c3 1 \u2212 N(N \u03c6 + 1)\u03c3 3\n2\n2\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\n12\n\nthis connection has the following properties \u03933s = \u2212A2 \u0393s and \u03934s = A2 \u03932s were\nA2 = 21 [(N 2 (\u03b2N \u03c6 + 1)2 \u2212 \u03b2 2 (NN \u2032 )2 ].\nThe holonomy associated with this path is given by\nU(\u03b3) = e{\u2212\n\nR 2\u03c0n\n0\n\n\u0393s d\u03c6}\n\n(82)\n\nWe can write the following expression for the holonomy matrix of\n\nU(\u03b3) = 1 +\n\n2\u0393s\n(2\u0393s )2\nsin{\u03c0n\u03c9} +\n[cos{\u03c0n\u03c9} \u2212 1],\n\u03c9\n\u03c92\n\n(83)\n\nwere \u03c9 2 = [N 2 (\u03b2N \u03c6 + 1) \u2212 \u03b2 2 (NN \u2032 )2 ]. Note that \u03c9 is the same that in the case\nof general paths in vector transport. The same analysis can be done in this case for a\nclass of special orbits.\nWe return to the analysis circular orbits. Instead of vectors, we will study the\nparallel transport of spinors. In order to do this, we will make the covariant derivative\n(71) null\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u0393\u03bc \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(84)\n\nThe first case to be analyzed will be of orbits with constant time, in this case the unique\nnon-null spinorial connection is \u0393\u03c6 , thus, we will have the following system to solve\n1\n(85)\n\u2202\u03c6 \u03c81 \u2212 Ni\u03c81 = 0,\n2\n1\n\u2202\u03c6 \u03c82 + Ni\u03c82 = 0.\n(86)\n2\nThese equations are easily integrated to\n!\n\niN\u03c6\n\u03c81 = \u03c81 (0) exp\n,\n2\n!\niN\u03c6\n.\n\u03c82 = \u03c82 (0) exp \u2212\n2\n\n(87)\n(88)\n\nThis result shows that when the spinor is parallel transported its components are\nchanged from \u03c8(0) to \u03c8. There are certain values of the radius of the orbit that preserve\nthe spinor's components, this means that there is no deficit angle. After n complete\nloops the square of the critical radius is given by\nr2 =\n\n[(2m/n)2 + 8M] \u00b1\n\nq\n\n[(2m/n)2 + 8M]2 \u2212 64J 2 \u03b12\n\n,\n(89)\n2\u03b12\nwhere m is integer. This result shows that combinations of certain values of the mass,\ncurvature and the angular moment can make the holonomy null.\n5. Concluding Remarks\nIn this article we evaluate the loop variables associated with the black string metric.\nWe use the gravitational loop variable and the holonomy to characterize the spacetime of the black string. We have shown by explicit computation from the metric\n\n\fLoop variables in the geometry of a rotating black string\n\n13\n\ncorresponding to a rotating black string that the loop variables are a combination of\nrotations and boosts in this spacetime. The holonomy transformations are elements of\nthe R\u00d7SO(2, 2) group. We can see from the results an effect, similar to the gravitational\nAharanov-Bohm effect in the cosmic string case, when vectors are transported in circles\naround the black string. The very important difference is that in the cosmic string\ncase the spacetime outside the defect is flat, in the present case the exterior region of\nthe defect has constant curvature. This effect is equivalent to the effects that appear\nin parallel transport of vectors or spinors in the background of the cosmic string with\ninternal structure.\nWe remark that there exist studies in the literature [16, 17] involving Wilson loops\nand BTZ black holes, but in a very different context from ours. These works use Wilson\nloops, in 2+1 Chern-Simons gravity, as a means to obtain the BTZ metric. In our\nwork we already have the metric and use the loop variables as a means of geometric\ncharacterization of the black string spacetime. Since we had an extra linear dimension\nadded to the BTZ space in order to obtain the black string, our results can be used to\ndescribe paralell transport of vectors or spinors in the BTZ background. The only effect\nwill be a dimensional reduction of the matrices describing the holonomy transformations.\nDue to the overall curvature of the black string spacetime, one would expect the\nholonomy to be nonzero everywhere. Nevertheless, there are special regions, specified\nby some values of the radial coordinate, which do present vanishing holonomy. This is\nthe band of holonomy invariance [5] for the loop variables in this spacetime that implies\nin holonomy quantization. This effect is demonstrated here for a spacetime that is not\nasymptotically flat, but radially asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We analyzed also the\nloop variables for the spinorial case and demonstrated the same band holonomy properties observed by Rothman, Ellis and Murugan[5]. We demonstrated, for the vectorial\ncase, that loop variables satisfy the Mandelstam relations and that the Wilson loop\npresented the same band of holonomy invariance. Finally we remark the importance of\nthe analysis of loop variables in the spacetime that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter as\na previous analysis of the global properties of the black string in a D-brane[22, 23, 24]\nscenario.\nAknowledgement\nfinancial support.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nWe thank to CAPES (PROCAD), CNPq and PRONEX for\n\nMandelstam S.
