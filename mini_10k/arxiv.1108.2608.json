It soon received public attention and subsequent works\nof others[2\u20139] have greatly perfected our understanding of inflation. Inflation has become\nso popular that almost all high energy theories have expressed their personal views on how\ninflation may be achieved, e.g. [10\u201314]. Even now, after 30 years of development, articles are\nstill being entitled \"inflation\" on a daily basis.\nAt the same time, reheating, the immediate subsequent scenario to inflation, was more or\nless in oblivion. It was not until 1994 that Kofman et al. came to realize[15] that the explosive\nparticle production, which they named as preheating, should be first processed before the\nordinary perturbative method is applied. Three years later, they proposed the analysis of\nreheating[16], covering numerous factors taken into account. (See [17] for a recent review.)\nBesides broad resonance, the narrow resonance also came into people's sight in the 1990s\nas a different non-perturbative particle production process during reheating[18, 19]. The\nanalytic study of preheating however remains stalled afterwards, although numerical studies\nand applications on inflationary models have been going on anyhow. Despite that some\napplications of the theory in [16] have been quite successful, it is still very mathematically\ninvolved, and therefore, some of the underlying physics are not revealed.\nOn the other hand, locked inflation[9] was proposed as a fastroll inflationary scenario.\nHowever, it was later found to be subject to multiple constraints, which together ruled out the\nwhole parameter space[20]. Among them, parametric resonance is a crucial one which may\nterminate locked inflation much earlier than expected. Recently, locked inflation is recalled\nin a cyclic universe model which incorporated D-branes and curvature[21], bringing locked\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\finflation and locked inflationary contraction to each cycle. The proposed model however\nfaces the same parametric resonance problem as locked inflation does.\nIn this article, we construct an analytic framework of parametric resonance for the\nhomogenous mode, in a way more straightforward and less involved. We then apply it on\npreheating and locked inflation, and discuss the possible inhomogeneity amplification effect.\nFirst, from section 2.1 to section 2.3, we solve a half cycle of parametric resonance and\nshow the cause of the exponential boost effect. In section 2.4, we add up the effect cycle by\ncycle and give the exact solution to the Mathieu equation. We then put universe expansion\ninto consideration in section 3.1 and investigate how backreaction acts as the terminator of\nparametric resonance in section 3.2. Such approaches then allow the discussion of preheating\nand locked inflation in section 4.1 and section 4.2 respectively. A brief discussion is carried\nout in section 5 on how parametric resonance may amplify the existing inhomogeneity and\nconstrain inflationary models. The results are summarized in section 6.\n\n2\n\nThe Simple Framework\n\nTo construct the framework, we consider the simple case first in a static background with\nLagrangian density\n1\n1\n1\n1\nL = \u2212 m2 \u03c62 \u2212 M 2 \u03c72 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c62 \u03c72 \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7\u2202\u03bc \u03c7.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c6 and \u03c7 are real scalar fields with bare masses m and M . Their interaction strength is\ncharacterized by the dimensionless parameter \u03bb. Here we consider the configuration of\n\u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 \u001d \u03bb\u03c72 and m2 \u001d M 2 to neglect all backreactions. | | indicates the amplitude of oscillation when operating on a field. We allow M 2 to be negative, but still use M 2\nto indicate the absolute value of M 2 for convenience when we compare it with other values.\nIn many of our calculations however, we just neglect M 2 because it's too small. Throughout\nthis paper, we will stick to the homogenous modes of both fields, so the spatial dependence\nwill also be neglected in the notation. For simplicity, we will also use the word \"parametric\nresonance\" to indicate only the parametric resonance within our assumed parameter space.\nPlease note this Lagrangian doesn't suffer from problems like negative infinite energy from\nthe negative M 2 because it's just the effective part we take out from the total Lagrangian,\nso terms like the quartic ones don't distract us. As long as such terms are negligible, one\ndoesn't need to worry about the validity of eq. (2.1).\nFrom the Lagrangian, we can write down the potential\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03c7) = m2 \u03c62 + M 2 \u03c72 + \u03bb\u03c62 \u03c72 ,\n2\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nin which m2 \u03c62 /2 dominates according to the above configuration. V (\u03c6, \u03c7) is visualized in\nfigure 1(a), where the vertical lines also suggests the domination of m2 \u03c62 /2. More details of\nthe potential are displayed in figure 1(b) and figure 1(c).\nIt is not difficult to imagine the motion of the two fields under such a configuration.\nUnder \u03bb\u03c72 \u001c m2 , \u03c6's effective mass squared would be m2\u03c6 \u2261 m2 + 2\u03bb\u03c72 \u2248 m2 and \u03c6 will\nalways be oscillating with frequency m and constant amplitude, unaffected by the motion of\n\u03c7. We can easily derive its equation of motion\n\u03c6\u0308 + (m2 + 2\u03bb\u03c72 )\u03c6 = 0,\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.3)\n\n\f\u03a7\n\n\u03a7\n\n\u03a6\n\n(a) Landscape of V (\u03c6, \u03c7)\n\n\u03a7\n\n\u03a6\n\n(b) Magnified with M 2 > 0\n\n\u03a6\n\n(c) Magnified with M 2 < 0\n\nFigure 1. Contour-plotting of V (\u03c6, \u03c7). The first figure gives the overall landscape. The next two are\nzoomed in to the marked region and redrawn for details with different signs of M 2 . A darker color\nimplies a larger potential energy.\n\nwhere dots mean derivatives w.r.t time. After neglecting \u03c7, we get the Simple Harmonic\nOscillator(SHO) solution \u03c6(t) = |\u03c6| sin mt.\n\u03c7's effective mass squared m2\u03c7 \u2261 2\u03bb\u03c62 + M 2 \u2248 2\u03bb\u03c62 is much larger than \u03c6's most of the\ntime, so it will oscillate much faster than \u03c6, as long as \u03c6 is not very close to zero. When \u03c6\ncrosses zero however, the motion of \u03c7 would become very different from the stage of large\n\u03c6. We will model the two stages in turn, trying to find out why and how \u03c7 is boosted\nexponentially. Still, we write the equation of motion of \u03c7 here for future reference.\n\u03c7\u0308 + (M 2 + 2\u03bb\u03c62 )\u03c7 = 0.\n2.1\n\n(2.4)\n\nRolling Stage\n\nThe rolling stage is when \u03c6 is not very close to zero, therefore \u03c7 is oscillating much faster\nthan \u03c6. It also requires that \u03c7's effective mass varies slowly and thus can be regarded as a\nconstant in each cycle of \u03c7's oscillation. For most cases in which the rolling stage takes up\nmore than half of \u03c6's oscillation, one only needs to take into account the second condition,\nand then the first one is automatically satisfied. So the condition of this stage is\ndm2\u03c7\n\u001c 1.\nm3\u03c7 dt\n\n(2.5)\n\nAlthough this stage can be easily solved with simple approximations, we still would like\nto work on it again here, mainly to arrive at the variables we are interested in and confirm\nthe rolling stage has a generally vanishing total effect on them. Suppose at time t = 0, \u03c7\nis at maximum with \u03c7 = |\u03c7| and \u03c7\u0307 = 0, and scalar field \u03c6 is rolling down slowly with time\nderivative \u03c6\u0307. We take the effective mass m\u03c7 constant and get the zeroth order SHO solution\nof eq. (2.4)\n\u03c7(0) \u2261 |\u03c7| cos m\u03c7 t.\n(2.6)\nWe then derive the equation of motion up to first order \u03c7(1) by introducing \u03c6\u0307,\n\u03c7\u0308(1) + m2\u03c7 \u03c7(1) + 4\u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307|\u03c7|t cos m\u03c7 t = 0\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fand get the solution with the initial condition \u03c7(1) (0) = 0 and \u03c7\u0307(1) (0) = 0,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307|\u03c7|\n(1)\n2 2\n\u03c7 (t) = \u2212\nm\u03c7 t cos m\u03c7 t + (m\u03c7 t \u2212 1) sin m\u03c7 t .\nm3\u03c7\n\n(2.8)\n\nAt time t = \u03c0/m\u03c7 , when \u03c7(0) reaches maximum again, we have\n\u03c7(1)\n\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u0011 \u03c0\u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307|\u03c7|\n=\n,\nm\u03c7\nm3\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\u0307(1)\n\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u0011 \u03c0 2 \u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307|\u03c7|\n=\n.\nm\u03c7\nm2\u03c7\n\n(2.9)\n\nIf we take when \u03c6 is rolling down as an example, we will find out \u03c7 gets an additional\namplitude correction from the decrease of \u03c6. To be precise, we consider the time interval\n\u2206t \u2261 \u03c0/m\u03c7 , during which \u03c7 rolls from one maximum to the other. \u03c7's amplitude is affected\nat a rate\n\u03c7(1) ( m\u03c0\u03c7 )\n\u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307\n\u2206|\u03c7|\n=\u2212\n= \u2212 2 |\u03c7|.\n(2.10)\n\u2206t\n\u2206t\nm\u03c7\nReplacing \u2206 with differential operator gives\n|\u03c7| \u221d \u221a\n\n1\n,\nm\u03c7\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich is the effect on |\u03c7| due to the variation of \u03c6.\nSimilarly, we can calculate \u03c7's phase change resulting from the variation of \u03c6, or m\u03c7\ndirectly. The motion of \u03c6 generates an additional \u03c7\u0307(1) (\u03c0/m\u03c7 ) which changes the time needed\nto push \u03c7 back to its maximum again. The phase change is therefore\n\u03c6\u03c7 \u2261\n\n\u03c7\u0307(1) ( m\u03c0\u03c7 )\nm\u03c7 |\u03c7|\n\n=\n\nm0\u03c7\n\u03c0 2 \u03bb\u03c6\u03c6\u0307\n\u03c0\n=\nlog\n,\nm3\u03c7\n2\nm\u03c7\n\n(2.12)\n\nin which m\u03c7 and m0\u03c7 are the initial and final effective masses of \u03c7.\nThe above calculation has shown how \u03c7 is affected by \u03c6's motion when \u03c6 is away from\nzero. Although the effects on \u03c7's amplitude (eq. (2.11)) and phase (eq. (2.12)) are strong, \u03c7\ncan't get exponentially boosted in this way. This is because the effects during the upward\nrolling period of \u03c6 are exactly inverse from those during the downward period, so they\ngenerally cancel. \u03c7 is increased when \u03c6 is rolling towards zero, but it get decreased when\n\u03c6 moves away from zero. The same thing happens to \u03c7's phase change, so the net effect\nvanishes.\n2.2\n\nZero-Crossing Stage\n\nWhen \u03c6 is small and \u03c6\u0307 is relatively large, the condition of rolling stage eq. (2.5) breaks, and\nthe system enters the zero-crossing stage. The zero-crossing stage is the period \u03c6 crosses\nzero. During this stage, the motion of \u03c7 is very much different from that during the rolling\nstage. It's because \u03c7's effective mass m\u03c7 varies very fast in this stage and can become smaller\nthan \u03c6's effective mass m\u03c6 when \u03c6 is crossing zero.\nBecause m2 \u001d \u03bb\u03c72 , we still adopt the approximation that \u03c6 is not affected by the\nmotion of \u03c7, and M 2 \u001c \u03bb|\u03c6|2 is still negligible. Here we set t = 0 at \u03c6 = 0. In most\napplications of parametric resonance, |mt| \u001c 1 holds throughout the zero-crossing stage. We\nthen get the motion of the two fields\n\u03c6 = |\u03c6|mt,\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fand thus\n\u03c7\u0308 + 2\u03bb|\u03c6|2 m2 t2 \u03c7 = 0.\n\n(2.14)\n\n1\n4\n\nHere we use \u03c4 \u2261 t(2\u03bb|\u03c6|2 m2 ) as the scaled time, and primes as derivatives w.r.t \u03c4 . The\nequation of motion of \u03c7 then becomes\n\u03c700 + \u03c4 2 \u03c7 = 0.\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe breaking of condition eq. (2.5) corresponds to |\u03c4 | \u223c< 1. If one is only interested in\nthe behavior of the system in |\u03c4 | < 1, one can simply expand \u03c7 in Taylor series of \u03c4 at \u03c4 = 0\nand only take the first few terms. Numerical simulation tells us, however, the energy boost\non \u03c7 spans not only |\u03c4 | < 1, but at an even broader range. To precisely calculate the boost\neffect, we need to take the analytic solution of eq. (2.15)\n\u00103\n\u00105\n1 \u0011\n1 \u0011\n\u03c7(\u03c4 ) = 0 F1 , \u2212 \u03c4 4 \u03c70 + 0 F1 , \u2212 \u03c4 4 \u03c700 \u03c4,\n(2.16)\n4 16\n4 16\nwhere 0 F1 (a, z) is the confluent hypergeometric (limit) function, and the subscript 0 denotes\nthe value of variables at \u03c4 = 0.\nGiven the initial condition \u03c70 and \u03c700 , one can already calculate the effect of parametric\nresonance. In order to enable our further calculation, we take out the leading term of \u03c7 for\n|\u03c4 | \u001d 1 (but |mt| \u001c 1 still holds). To do this, we expand 0 F1 (a, \u2212z) in series of 1/z. The\nleading term is\n\u0010\u03c0\n\u221a \u0011 1 a\n\u0393(a)\nsin (2a + 1) \u2212 2 z z 4 \u2212 2 ,\nz \u001d 1.\n(2.17)\n0 F1 (a, \u2212z) \u2248 \u221a\n4\n\u03c0\nHere we want to calculate the energy boost effect from parametric resonance, so we\ncharacterize the boost rate with\nEs (\u03c4 )\n1\nlim log\n.\n(2.18)\n\u03b7\u2261\n2 \u03c4 \u2192+\u221e\nEs (\u2212\u03c4 )\nThe scaled energy density of \u03c7 is defined as\nEs (\u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03c4 2 \u03c72 (\u03c4 ) + \u03c702 (\u03c4 ),\nwith its relation with the (unscaled) total energy density of \u03c7\nr\n1\n\u03bb|\u03c6|2 m2\nE \u2261 \u03bb|\u03c6|2 m2 t2 \u03c72 + \u03c7\u03072 =\nEs .\n2\n2\nSubstituting eq. (2.16) and eq. (2.17) into eq. (2.18), we arrive at\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4 2\u0393( 34 )\u0393( 54 )\u03c70 \u03c700\n1\n\u221a\n\u03b7 = log 1 +\n.\n2\n\u03932 ( 34 )\u03c720 \u2212 2 2\u0393( 34 )\u0393( 54 )\u03c70 \u03c700 + 4\u03932 ( 45 )\u03c702\n0\n\n(2.19)\n\n(2.20)\n\n(2.21)\n\nIn the above equation, the limit \u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e has already been taken. As a result, all\n\u221a\nnon-leading terms of \u03c4 are removed. The 2 z in the sin function of 0 F1 approximation is\nremoved too.\nFrom eq. (2.21) we find the boost rate is hardly dependent on any parameter of the\nsystem, (m, \u03bb, etc,) or the energy density of any component, as long as our previous assumptions stay valid. It is also easily verified by numerical simulations. This constant property\nis very helpful when we sum the boost rates across cycles of \u03c6 in subsequent calculations.\nThe fraction in the log function of eq. (2.21) should be of order unity, so the boost effect is\nsignificant and exponential. The boost rate \u03b7 acquires the same sign with \u03c70 \u03c700 , which means\nthe energy of \u03c7 can either be boosted or dampened, depending on the sign of \u03c70 \u03c700 .\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f2.3\n\nPhase Delay\n\nIn the above subsection, we have represented \u03b7 with \u03c70 and \u03c700 , the motion state of \u03c7 at\n\u03c6 = 0. The previous calculation however only gives half of the analytic solution - we can\ncalculate \u03b7 with any given \u03c70 and \u03c700 , but we haven't developed any method in deriving\nthem two, except numerical ways. Therefore we will derive \u03c70 and \u03c700 analytically in this\nsubsection and provide a completely analytic solution. But before that, it's quite important\nto first clarify what \"phase\" is referred to here.\nThe system has two degrees of freedom, \u03c6 and \u03c7, which means we need four independent\nparameters to fully describe the motion state of the system at any specific time. We are\ninterested in the two parameters characterizing \u03c7, which can either be chosen as \u03c7 and \u03c70 ,\nor its amplitude and phase. From eq. (2.21), we have already learned the boost rate \u03b7 is\na function of \u03c70 and \u03c700 . Although \u03c7 is not strictly a SHO at the zero-crossing stage, if\nwe manage to represent the motion of \u03c7 at \u03c6 = 0 with an amplitude-like and a phase-like\nvariable however, the amplitude-like variable would cancel and \u03b7 would then only depend\non the phase-like variable. It's obvious \u03b7 may not stay constant in every half cycle of \u03c6,\nso reducing \u03b7 to a single-parameter function allows us to track \u03b7 better when studying the\nboost effect across many cycles of \u03c6.\nIn order to find the phase representation of \u03c7 at \u03c6 = 0, we attempt to solve \u03c70 and \u03c700\nreversely. It is reasonable to believe \u03c7 is SHO-like at |\u03c4 | \u001d 1 and set the initial condition as\np\np\nEs (\u03c4 )\n\u03c7(\u03c4 ) =\nsin \u03b2,\n\u03c70 (\u03c4 ) = Es (\u03c4 ) cos \u03b2\n(2.22)\n|\u03c4 |\nwhere \u03b2 is the variable we use to represent the phase of \u03c7 at \u03c4 . We are only interested in \u03b2\nhere, so we come up with the combination\n|\u03c4 |\u03c7 cos \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c70 sin \u03b2 = 0.\n\n(2.23)\n\nBy putting in the solution eq. (2.16) and eq. (2.17), it simplies to\n\u00103\u0011 \u0010\n\u00105\u0011 \u0010\n1\n5 \u0011\n1\n7 \u0011\n\u0393\nsin \u03b2 + \u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c70 = 2\u0393\nsin \u03b2 + \u03c4 2 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c700 .\n4\n2\n8\n4\n2\n8\n\n(2.24)\n\nFor a specific process with initial conditions given, \u03c70 and \u03c700 should be definite and\nthus independent of the choice of \u03c4 in eq. (2.24). For this reason, we contract the \u03c4 2 /2 into\n\u03b2 and redefine \u03b2 as\n1\n7\n\u03b2 = \u03b2(\u03c4 ) \u2261 \u03b20 \u2212 \u03c4 2 + \u03c0,\n(2.25)\n2\n8\nwhere \u03b20 is the variable for phase but it's now independent of time \u03c4 . For short, we will\nhowever still use \u03b2 to indicate \u03b20 . In this way, eq. (2.24) also becomes independent of \u03c4 , and\nsimplifies to\n\u00103\u0011\n\u0010\n\u00105\u0011\n\u03c0\u0011\n\u03c70 \u0393\ncos \u03b2 \u2212\n= 2\u03c700 \u0393\nsin \u03b2.\n(2.26)\n4\n4\n4\nThis immediately gives the solution\n\u00105\u0011\n\u03c70 = 2\u0393\nsin \u03b2 X,\n4\n\u00103\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c0\u0011\n\u03c700 = \u0393\ncos \u03b2 \u2212\nX,\n4\n4\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(2.27)\n(2.28)\n\n\fx\nmaxH x\u00a4L\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n\u03a0\n\n3\u03a0\n2\n\n\u0392\n2\u03a0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\nFigure 2. \u03c70 and \u03c700 as functions of \u03b2. x (in the label of y-axis) represents \u03c70 and \u03c700 for the blue\nand purple curve respectively. The max goes over all \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) so all functions are normalized to be\nmaximally at unity. The dashed curve is the expected \u03c700 curve derived from \u03c70 if \u03c7 were a SHO all\nthe time. The purple curve's deviation from the dashed curve shows the phase delay in \u03c7's kinetic\npart at \u03c4 = 0. Parameters are chosen as \u03bb = 1, m = 1, M = 10\u22123 , |\u03c6| = 100, and they are chosen\nas such by default in the following figures.\n\nwhere X is a function of \u03b2 and Es (\u03c4 ) and is not important in our calculation.\nBy comparing it with the SHO solution, or the SHO-like solution eq. (2.22), one can\nfind out the motion of \u03c7 at \u03c4 = 0 is indeed non-SHO. The phase of its kinetic term is delayed\nby \u03c0/4. This is also confirmed numerically for all \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) in figure 2. Such a phase delay\ncan be understood from the decreasing transfer efficiency from \u03c7's potential energy to kinetic\nenergy as \u03c6 is approaching zero. Given the \u03b2 that makes \u03c70 = 0, i.e. \u03c7 at the bottom of its\npotential at \u03c4 = 0, such \u03b2 doesn't induce the largest \u03c700 any more. To understand it better,\nwe compare such \u03b2 with \u03b2\u0303 = \u03b2 + \u03b4\u03b2, where 0 < \u03b4\u03b2 \u001c 1. The difference caused by \u03b4\u03b2 is\ntwo-fold. On one hand, the phase \u03b2\u0303 makes \u03c7 reach every value slightly earlier than phase \u03b2,\nand such difference in timing gives \u03b2\u0303 a larger effective mass of \u03c7 when compare at the same\nvalue of \u03c7, and in consequence, a larger energy transfer efficiency of order \u03b4\u03b2. On the other\nhand, for \u03b2\u0303, \u03c7 gets an extra up-climbing period just before \u03c4 = 0. This effect decreases the\nenergy transfer efficiency of \u03b2\u0303, but only has order \u03b4\u03b2 2 . As a result, the net effect is \u03b2\u0303 has\na larger energy transfer efficiency and therefore a larger kinetic energy. The maximum of\nkinetic energy is then shifted towards a larger \u03b2, and its phase gets delayed relatively.\nWe continue our calculation by substituting the set of solution eq. (2.27) and eq. (2.28)\ninto the expression of \u03b7, eq. (2.21), and it becomes a very simple function of \u03b2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c0\u0011\n\u03b7(\u03b2) = log 1 + 4 2 sin \u03b2 cos \u03b2 \u2212\n.\n(2.29)\n2\n4\nWe are now able to compare our results with numerical ones. In figure 3, three curves of\n\u03b7 are drawn - the analytical result eq. (2.29), the numerical solution, and the semi-analytical\nresult which is acquired by substituting the numerically derived \u03c70 and \u03c700 into eq. (2.21).\nAll three curves match perfectly.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f\u0397\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n\u03a0\n\n3\u03a0\n2\n\n\u0392\n2\u03a0\n\n-0.5\n\nFigure 3. The energy boost effect w.r.t \u03b2. All curves are horizontally shifted to be starting at\n\u03b7 = 0 and d\u03b7/d\u03b2 > 0 when \u03b2 = 0, so they are aligned. The curves of analytical solution, numerical\nsimulation and semi-analytic result overlap perfectly so only one curve is visible.\n\nSo now we have successfully reduced the parametric resonance effect to a completely\nconstant one - it depends only on \u03b2, the phase of \u03c7. Ths boost rate is however independent\nof any of the parameters of the system, \u03bb, m, etc, or even the energy density of \u03c7. This is\nindeed the case from numerical simulations. Because the boost rate is independent of the\nenergy of \u03c7, we can simply sum the boost rates when calculating the total boost rate for\nmany cycles of \u03c6.\nIf we naively assume \u03b2 is evenly distributed in [0, 2\u03c0), and observe many enough independent half cycles of parametric resonance, the average boost rate can then be calculated,\nwhich is\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nh\u03b7i \u2261\n\u03b7(\u03b2)d\u03b2 = 0.346.\n(2.30)\n2\u03c0 0\nThis actually means for every half cycle of \u03c6, \u03c7's energy density becomes e2h\u03b7i = 2 times of\nits original. For future reference, here we also define the maximum boost rate\n\u03b7m \u2261 max \u03b7(\u03b2) = \u03b7\n\u03b2\u2208[0,2\u03c0)\n\n2.4\n\n\u00103 \u0011\n\u221a\n\u03c0 = log(1 + 2) = 0.881.\n8\n\n(2.31)\n\nLong Time Evolution\n\nWe now continue to study the long time evolution of \u03c7 across cycles of \u03c6. Suppose the initial\nphase of \u03c7 is \u03b2, by which we mean initially, when \u03c6 reaches its maximum, there is\ns\n\u221a\nE\n\u03c7=\nsin \u03b2,\n\u03c7\u0307 = 2E cos \u03b2.\n(2.32)\n2\n\u03bb|\u03c6|\nWe can then use the boost rate \u03b7(\u03b2) acquired in the last subsection to evolve the system\nfrom one maximum of \u03c6 to the next. To characterize the state of \u03c7, at every maximum of\n\u03c6 we use a polar coordinate system as the phase diagram of \u03c7.\nP The angular coordinate is\n\u03b7\na\nchosen to be \u03b2, and the radial coordinate is e , where \u03b7a \u2261\n\u03b7 is the total boost rate.\nprevious\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\f2\n+\n+++++++++\n+\n+\n+++\n+\n+\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n++\n++\n+\n+\n+\n----------- + +\n+\n-----+\n+\n--+----+\n+\n--+\n+\n--+\n+\n--+\n+\n-- +\n+\n---++\n+\n-+\n++\n+ +\n+ +\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+ -+\n+ -+\n--+\n+\n-+\n-+\n-+\n---- + +\n+\n--+\n---+---+\n+\n---------+\n+\n++\n++\n+\n+\n++\n++\n++\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+++\n+\n+\n++++++++++\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nFigure 4. Phase diagram of \u03c7 at the neighboring maxima of \u03c6. The initial condition at the earlier\nmaximum of \u03c6 is set to a smooth unit circle with mark \"\u2013\". Sign \"+\" marks the later maximum, i.e.\nafter half a cycle of \u03c6. Plots are colored according to their initial phase \u03b2, so every \"\u2013\" mark evolves\nto its corresponding \"+\" mark with the same color. The rotation of colors indicates the phase shift\n- the difference between the \u03b2's at the neighboring maxima of \u03c6.\n\nTherefore the x and y coordinates are proportional to \u03c7\u0307 and \u03c7 respectively. If we choose the\ninitial condition as a constant energy density with evenly distributed \u03b2, it then corresponds\nto a smooth circle with unit radius on the phase diagram. For a general overview, numerical\nresults are given in figure 4, figure 5 and figure 6.\nThese figures suggest a set of linear operations be applied on each \"\u2013\" mark on the\nphase diagram, in order to get to its corresponding \"+\" mark with analytical methods. The\nlinearity is also determined by the linear equation of motion of \u03c7. To clearly demonstrate the\noperations are linear, we represent plots on the phase diagram with (1, 2) matrices (x, y)T\nof their Cartesian coordinates, and model the total evolution of field \u03c7 between neighboring\nmaxima of \u03c6 as a (2, 2) linear transformation matrix, which we call here as the transformation\nmatrix. The transformation matrix should then be decomposed into two parts:\n1. During the zero-crossing stage, \u03c7 is boosted with the boost rate \u03b7 a function of phase\n\u03b2. So for an initial circle on the phase diagram, it is distorted to an ellipse because of\nthe phase dependence of \u03b7. For convenience, we rotate the ellipse by shifting \u03b2 to align\nits major axis with x-axis. If the initial circle has a radius e\u03b7a , we know at once the\nsemi-major axis has length e\u03b7a +\u03b7m , and the length of semi-minor axis is e\u03b7a \u2212\u03b7m . The\nlargest negative boost rate \u2212\u03b7m comes from the time-reversibility of \u03c7's equation of\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ +\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+++\n+++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n++\n++\n--+\n-+\n--+\n-+\n--+\n+\n+\n----+\n-------------------------+\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n+\n+\n\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++\n++\n+++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+++\n+++\n++\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n++++\n+++\n+++\n++\n++\n\n+\n\n+ +\n\n+\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 5. Phase redistribution over half a cycle of \u03c6. This figure aims to show how the evolution\nover half a cycle of \u03c6 affects the distribution of \u03b2, i.e. the phase of \u03c7. It is based on figure 4, and\nderived by scaling every \"+\" plot to the same radius while keeping its phase \u03b2 fixed.\n\nmotion. When time-reversed, the largest (positive) boost rate \u03b7m always corresponds\nto the largest negative boost rate \u2212\u03b7m and proves its existence. During this step, the\nplot in the phase diagram is transformed to (x0 , y 0 )T which satisfies\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 0\u0013 \u0012 \u03b7\nx\nx\nem 0\n=\n.\n(2.33)\n0\n\u2212\u03b7\nm\ny\ny\n0 e\n2. The ellipse is rotated with an angle which is generated from the difference of the periods\nof \u03c6 and \u03c7. This is because the period of \u03c6 is not an integer times of the period of \u03c7.\nTherefore \u03c7 doesn't return to the exactly same position when \u03c6 reaches maximum (or\nzero) again as where it was at \u03c6's last maximum (or zero). One can easily confirm the\nrotation angle is independent of phase \u03b2, so the elliptical shape is preserved. Here we\nsuppose the rotation angle that should be added to \u03b2 is \u03b4, so the plot is transformed to\n\u0012 00 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012 0 \u0013\nx\ncos \u03b4 \u2212 sin \u03b4\nx\n=\n.\n(2.34)\ny 00\nsin \u03b4 cos \u03b4\ny0\nBy definition, \u03b4 is the phase \u03c7 goes through from one maximum of \u03c6 to the next.

Since (x, y)T is multiplied on the\nleft by the transformation matrix for every half cycle of \u03c6, the total boost rate is actually\ndetermined by many powers of the transformation matrix. For this purpose, we have derived\neq. (2.36) which allows us to only consider the power of the eigenvalues of the transformation\nmatrix.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nFor b2 > 1 i.e. cos2 \u03b4 > 1/ cosh2 \u03b7m , we have b \u2212 b2 \u2212 1 < 1 < b + b2 \u2212 1. Because\none eigenvalue is larger than the other, the overall effect is the system converges to the\neigenstate with the larger eigenvalue. This means all initial phases converge to the same one\nafter enough long time. Because the larger eigenvalue is greater than 1, \u03c7's total energy also\nincreases gradually.\nFor b2 < 1 i.e. cos2 \u03b4 < 1/ cosh2 \u03b7m , the two eigenvalues have unit magnitude and\nopposite arguments. Consequently there is no such phase convergence, and no overall change\nin \u03c7's total energy should be expected.\n1\n\nTo be more precise, one may want to calculate the transformation matrix via a three-step method - two\nrotations with angle \u03b4/2 separated by a boost. The difference however only shows in the eigenvectors B, but\nthe eigenvalues remain the same.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fSuch difference is also quite clear from the figures. The boost rate has dependence on\nthe initial phase and transforms a circle in the phase diagram to an ellipse. Because of such a\ntransformation, the phases converge towards x-axis. On the other hand, \u03b4 rotates the ellipse\nand this may ruin the convergence if it's large enough. These two effects compete and, in\nconsequence, the above two distinct behaviors of the system may occur.\nThis also explains the exact solution of eq. (2.4), the so-called Mathieu equation. The\nsolution of Mathieu equation has bands of stable solutions in which the amplitude of \u03c7\ngenerally remains at its initial scale as time passes, and bands of unstable solutions which\nhave an exponentially growing |\u03c7| w.r.t time. Those bands correspond exactly to the nonconvergent and convergent cases respectively.\nFor better understanding, we can also calculate the phase that is converged to. The\nfixed points under transformation matrix eq. (2.36) satisfy y 00 /x00 = y/x, i.e.\n\nThe solutions are\n\ny\ny 00\nxe2\u03b7m sin \u03b4 + y cos \u03b4\n= 00 = 2\u03b7m\n.\nx\nx\nxe\ncos \u03b4 \u2212 y sin \u03b4\n\n(2.37)\n\np\ny\nsinh \u03b7m \u00b1 sinh2 \u03b7m \u2212 tan2 \u03b4\n.\n=\nx\ne\u03b7m tan \u03b4\n\n(2.38)\n\nWe can see how the solution is represented in the phase diagram in figure 7. From the\nfigure we know at once we should take the minus sign in eq. (2.38) as the phase converged\nto. Based on these results, we can further derive \u03c7's long-time boost rate (which takes time\nfar more than sufficient for convergence to take place, if there is). For the convergent case,\nthe long time boost rate is simply the log of the larger eigenvalue in eq. (2.36), and for the\nnon-convergent case, no boost occurs so the long time boost rate is zero. We thus define the\nlong time boost rate as\n\uf8f1\n1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20\n,\ncos2 \u03b4 <\n=\n2\n2 (2.39)\ncosh \u03b7m\nq\n\u03b7l (\u03b4) \u2261\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 log cosh \u03b7m cos \u03b4 + cosh2 \u03b7m cos2 \u03b4 \u2212 1 ,\notherwise.\nIt's also visualized in figure 8.\nIn figure 8, we can see the convergent-non-convergent boundary is at \u03c0/4, which is exact\nand can be confirmed from the expression of \u03b7m . This indicates only half of the \u03b4 values give\na long-time boost effect. If we consider the case with a \u03b4 slowly scanning over [0, 2\u03c0) at a\nconstant speed, we would get the average long-time boost rate\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\nh\u03b7l i \u2261\n\u03b7l (\u03b4)d\u03b4 \u2248 0.346.\n(2.40)\n2\u03c0 0\nPlease note there is relation \u03b7l (\u2212\u03b4) = \u03b7l (\u03c0 + \u03b4) = \u03b7l (\u03b4).\nIt's quite interesting here to notice h\u03b7l i \"happens\" to be very close to h\u03b7i. Although\nthe expressions of h\u03b7i and h\u03b7l i are very different, this however is not a coincidence. h\u03b7i and\nh\u03b7l i are actually identical and numerical integrals have confirmed that. It is not yet very\nclear why they are equal, but the following might be a reasonable explanation. Every value\nof \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) is actually hit the same number of times during the calculation of h\u03b7i and\nh\u03b7l i. Consequently the transformation matrices of all \u03b4's operate on the initial state the\nsame number of times, although the order of the operations is different for h\u03b7i and h\u03b7l i. The\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fFigure 7. The diagram showing the four fixed phases under transformation eq. (2.36), and four\nregions of other phases with different directions converge towards. Here \u03b4 \u2248 \u03c0/6. The red line is\nthe phase converged to and is thus fixed under the transformation. The dashed curves with arrows\nshow the directions other phases converge towards in different regions. The blue line stands at\nthe boundaries of the neighboring regions heading towards opposite directions, and therefore is also\ninvariant under the transformation. The red and blue lines are eigenstates with the larger and smaller\neigenvalues respectively.\n\ntransformation matrices do not commute, but their commutation is only a rotation. The\ncommutation could result in an either slightly larger or smaller boost rate, depending on\nwhether the rotation is towards the major axis of the total transformation matrix or away\nfrom it. A huge number of such commutations is needed to make the two sequences the\nsame. Some of the commutations contributes positively to the total boost rate while others\nnegatively. When summed up, their effects cancel, and maybe one might be willing to think\nthis as the reason of the equivalence between h\u03b7i and h\u03b7l i.\n\n3\n\nSteps Towards Cosmological Applications\n\nSo far, we have established the framework to consider the boost effect of parametric resonance\nin a static background. To apply it practically on cosmology, there are still a few steps should\nbe taken first. One is the need to put our framework into the expanding background; the\nother is the consideration of backreaction. We will discuss them in this section.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f\u0397l\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u03a0\n2\n\n\u2206\n\nFigure 8. The long time boost rate under different rotation angles \u03b4. Smaller \u03b4 typically leads to\nlarger boost rate because the eigenstate is more aligned with the phase of maximum boost rate. Large\nenough \u03b4's don't generate any long-time boost effect because they are the non-convergent cases.\n\n3.1\n\nDynamic Background\n\nWhen we apply this model in cosmology, a dynamic background is required.2 We will still\nneglect the backreaction in this section, so the effect of expansion on \u03c6 is simply a damping\n3\nfactor |\u03c6| \u221d a\u2212 2 (t), where a(t) is the scale factor. The equation of motion of \u03c7 however\nbecomes\n\u03c7\u0308 + 3H \u03c7\u0307 + 2\u03bb\u03c62 \u03c7 = 0,\n(3.1)\nwhere H \u2261 da/adt is the Hubble rate of the universe, and can be regarded as a constant for\n3\neach half cycle of \u03c6. Writing \u03c7 = a 2 \u03a8 simplifies eq. (3.1) to\n\u03a8\u0308 + 2\u03bb\u03c62 \u03a8 = 0,\n\n(3.2)\n\nin which we have neglected the effective mass contribution from universe expansion for\n3\n\u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 > H 2 . Therefore we can see the universe expansion also gives \u03c7 an a\u2212 2 term.\nHowever the universe expansion has other impacts on our framework. As |\u03c6| is damped\nby expansion, the rotation angle \u03b4 no longer remains constant across cycles of \u03c6. Therefore\nchanges should be made to the calculations in section 2.4. For convenience, we use the\nnotation x(n) to indicate the variable x of the nth half cycle of \u03c6, or at the time when \u03c6\nreaches its maximum the nth time. When all the subscripts (n) are equal in one equation,\nwe may neglect some or all of them, as long as no confusion might be caused. Primes here\nare defined as the difference\nx0(n) \u2261 x(n+1) \u2212 x(n) .\n(3.3)\n2\nBesides expansion, this model is also applicable in contracting phases without any prejudice. Because we\nare more concerned with the expanding phase, we will only discuss the effect of universe expansion here. The\neffect of contraction however, can be derived in the same way, and stages are simply reversely sequenced in\nmost cases.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fDifferent from the static version eq. (2.35), in an expanding background, \u03b4(n) should be\nredefined as\nZ t(n+1) =t(n) + \u03c0 \u221a\n2m\n\u03b4(n) \u2261\n(3.4)\n2 2\u03bb|\u03c6|(t) cos mtdt.\nt(n)\n\nTo finish the integral, we manually fix |\u03c6|(t) at |\u03c6|(n) , so it gives the same result with eq.\n(2.35). This approximation however gives \u03b4(n) an error\n\u221a\nZ t(n+1) \u221a\n2 2\u03bb||\u03c6|0 (n) |\n\u2206\u03b4(n) <\n2 2\u03bb||\u03c6|(n+1) \u2212 |\u03c6|(n) | cos mtdt =\n(3.5)\nm\nt(n)\nwhere the outer | | is to take absolute values. For short, we have\n\u221a\n2 2\u03bb||\u03c6|0 |\n.\n\u2206\u03b4 <\nm\n\n(3.6)\n\nSimilarly we get\n0\n\n\u03b4 \u2261 \u03b4(n+1) \u2212 \u03b4(n)\n\n\u221a\n2 2\u03bb|\u03c6|0\n=\n,\n\u221a m 00\n2 2\u03bb|\u03c6|\n,\n=\nm\n\n0\n0\n\u03b4 00 \u2261 \u03b4(n+1)\n\u2212 \u03b4(n)\n\u221a\n2 2\u03bb||\u03c6|00 |\n0\n\u2206\u03b4 <\n= |\u03b4 00 |.\nm\n\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\nThe universe expansion redshifts |\u03c6|, giving\n3\u03c0H\n|\u03c6|0\n3\u03c0H\n= e\u2212 2m \u2212 1 = \u2212\n,\n|\u03c6|\n2m\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich consequently redshifts \u03b4. The average effect of parametric resonance is then determined\nby the scales of \u03b4, \u03b4 0 and \u03b4 00 .\nWhen \u03b4 0 \u001c 1, \u03b4 changes very slowly compared with the oscillation of \u03c6. The system\ntherefore has enough time to converge to the eigenstate whenever there's any. Then the\nsystem can be regarded as trapped in its eigenstate which is slowly varying. The boost rate\n\u03b7l (\u03b4) changes correspondingly as \u03b4 slowly decreases, and the average boost rate in this case\nshould then be taken as the long-time boost rate, h\u03b7l i, defined in eq. (2.40). As \u03b4 is slowly\nredshifted by universe expansion, the convergent and non-convergent cases are met in turn.\nThis makes \u03c7's evolution stair-like at this stage. Half of the time, the amplitude of \u03c7 enjoys\nflat platforms lasting for cycles of \u03c6 during which it doesn't grow at all. The platforms are\nseparated by steep growing regions which fills the other half of the time. The two distinct\nstages come in turn to get the stair-like curve of \u03c7's amplitude.\nWhen \u03b4 0 \u223c> 1 but \u03b4 00 \u001c 1, \u03b4 varies fast but \u03b4 0 varies very slowly. In this case, \u03b4\nchanges significantly between neighboring half cycles of \u03c6, but the amount changed stays\nalmost fixed. For every half cycle of \u03c6, an almost constant \u03b4 0 \u223c 1 adds to the initial rotation\nangle \u03b4. Therefore for time long enough, the average effect is \u03b2 has an even probability at\neach value in [0, 2\u03c0). This corresponds to an even distribution of \u03b2 in \u03b7(\u03b2) and, results in\nthe average boost rate which should be chosen as h\u03b7i in eq. (2.30).\nWhen \u03b4 00 \u223c> 1, the relevance between neighboring \u03b4's or \u03b4 0 's is small, so one usually\nconsiders \u03b4(n) as random in [0, 2\u03c0), being irrelevant with the history of evolution.

The numerical simulation result of many preheating processes compared with our statistical\nestimation. (See section 4.1.) Universal parameters are m = 10\u22126 Mp , M = 10\u221210 Mp , and \u03b3 = 10\u22129 .\nThe only varying parameter for different simulations is the interaction strength \u03bb, starting at 10\u22124\nand ending at 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 , with a step increment 10%. The green plots are the data from numerical\nsimulation, taken every time \u03c6 reaches maximum. The red line is the statistical average result and\nthe two blue lines enclose the area within error 1\u03c3, derived from \u2206h\u03ae(n) i in eq. (3.14). On the left\nhalf, we see a reasonable amount of plots lying outside the blue curves because we only expect 68% of\nthe plots in 1\u03c3. On the right half the universe actually enters the small \u03b4 0 stage and the error doesn't\ngrow so much. However the blue lines are derived under the assumption that the whole evolution is\nthe large \u03b4 0 stage, so they are only functions of n and keep extending. Thus we find on the right half,\nthe number of plots outside the blue lines is significantly decreased. The numerical data stop when\nbackreactions start to be important.\n\nenough time is experienced, the random distribution of \u03b4 gives the same results as the case\nof \u03b4 0 \u223c> 1 and \u03b4 00 \u001c 1 so h\u03b7i should also be chosen as the average boost rate.\nIn realistic cases however, it is rare to tell the last two stages apart. They share the\nsame average boost rate h\u03b7i and most of their characteristics are alike, so there is no need\nto distinguish them. Moreover, the second category has a \u03b4 00 \u001c 1 but non-vanishing. To\ndemonstrate the difference between the last two categories, the even probability of \u03b2 needs\nto be shown. This however requires a prolonged constant value of \u03b4 0 , which in most cases is\nvery difficult to achieve with a non-vanishing \u03b4 00 , even though it's much smaller than 1. For\nthese reasons, we will treat them as a whole (\u03b4 0 \u223c> 1) in our following discussions and call\nit the large \u03b4 0 stage, in which \u03b4(n) is randomly distributed and independent of the history. In\nthe same way, we name \u03b4 0 \u001c 1 as the small \u03b4 0 stage.\nWe now fall back to check the approximation we made previously in eq. (3.6) and eq.\n(3.9), where |\u03c6| and |\u03c60 | are regarded as constants in every half cycle. They give errors\n\u2206\u03b4 < |\u03b4 0 | and \u2206\u03b4 0 < |\u03b4 00 |, which fit perfectly with the three stages above. Therefore this\napproximation is applicable here.\nBefore we end this discussion on dynamic background, we would like to briefly calculate\nthe statistical results from the random \u03b4 for the large \u03b4 0 stage. In n2 cycles of \u03c6, the boost\neffect of parametric resonance occurs n times.

Since we assumed homogeneity, we will not discuss other\nbackreactions here. In most cases of parametric resonance, the assumption \u03bb\u03c72 \u001c m2 starts\nvalid. However as \u03c7's\n\u221a amplitude gets boosted by resonance, this assumption would finally\nbreak at |\u03c7| \u223c m/ \u03bb, provided\nthe boost effect hasn't yet been halted by other causes.\np\n2 , for every half cycle of \u03c6, |\u03c7| reaches its maximum when\nBecause |\u03c7|2 \u221d m\u22121\n\u2248\n1/\n2\u03bb\u03c6\n\u03c7\n\u03c6 \u2192 0. From this point of view, the violation of this approximation first starts small - only\nat \u03c6 \u2192 0 - and then expands top\nlarger \u03c6 gradually while |\u03c7| is being further boosted.\nFrom the relation |\u03c7|2 \u221d 1/ 2\u03bb\u03c62 , we can find the effective potential for \u03c6, which is\nactually\n1\n1\n1\nVeff (\u03c6) \u2261 m2 \u03c62 + \u03bb\u03c62 \u03c72 = m2 \u03c62 + \u03bb|\u03c7|2m |\u03c6||\u03c6|abs ,\n(3.15)\n2\n2\n2\nwhere |\u03c7|m is \u03c7's amplitude at maximum \u03c6, and | |abs means taking the absolute value\n(and | | still indicates taking the amplitude). Here we can see the additional part of Veff (\u03c6)\nis proportional to the absolute of \u03c6. Compared with 12 m2 \u03c62 which is proportional to \u03c62 ,\nthe effective potential from interaction Veff (\u03c6) agrees with our previous instinct that the\nbackreaction first comes to important at small \u03c6.\nSo we consider the motion of \u03c6 for half a cycle, starting from t = 0, \u03c6 = \u2212|\u03c6|, \u03c6\u0307 = 0,\nand |\u03c7| = |\u03c7|m . We will use \u03b3 2 \u2261 \u03bb|\u03c7|2m /m2 for simplicity. When \u03c6 < 0, \u03c6's equation of\nmotion is\n\u03c6\u0308 + m2 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb|\u03c7|2m |\u03c6| = 0.\n(3.16)\nWe can analytically solve this equation and arrive at \u03c6 = 0. The solution is\nt = t1 \u2261\n\n1\n\u03b32\narccos 2\n,\nm\n\u03b3 +1\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n(3.17)\n\n\f\u03c6\u0307(t = t1 ) = (\u03b3 2 + 1)m|\u03c6| sin mt1 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nAt \u03c6 = 0, \u03c7 is boosted by parametric resonance. This gives the interaction part of\nVeff (\u03c6) a factor of e2\u03b7 . Here \u03b7 is still the boost rate. For this reason, the equation of motion\nis slightly modified for \u03c6 > 0,\n\u03c6\u0308 + m2 \u03c6 + \u03bb|\u03c7|2m |\u03c6|e2\u03b7 = 0.\n\n(3.19)\n\nWe then solve it again to arrive at \u03c6\u0307 = 0 and finish the half cycle. At the \u03c6 > 0 side when \u03c6\nreaches maximum again at time t = t2 , we have\nt2 = t1 +\n\n\u03c0\n1\n\u03b3 2 e2\u03b7\n,\n\u2212 arctan p\n2m m\n\u03b32 + 1\n\np\n\u03c6(t = t2 ) = |\u03c6|( \u03b3 4 e4\u03b7 + 2\u03b3 2 + 1 \u2212 \u03b3 2 e2\u03b7 ),\nand\n|\u03c7| = e\u03b7 |\u03c7|m\n\n|\u03c6|\n.\n\u03c6\n\n(3.20)\n(3.21)\n(3.22)\n\nWe can clearly see when \u03b7 = 0, there is no boost effect and the motion of the system becomes\nsymmetric w.r.t \u03c6 = 0.\nWhen the backreaction is weak, i.e. \u03b3 2 \u001c 1, we can expand the results to first order\nand get\nt2 =\n\ne2\u03b7 + 1 2\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u03b3 ,\nm\u0010\nm\n\n(3.23)\n\u0011\n\n\u03c6(t2 ) = |\u03c6| 1 \u2212 (e2\u03b7 \u2212 1)\u03b3 2 ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n|\u03c7| = e\u03b7 |\u03c7|m 1 + (e2\u03b7 \u2212 1)\u03b3 2 ,\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0010\u03c0\n\u0011 \u0013\n2 2\u03bb|\u03c6|\n2\u03b7\n\u03b4 =\n1\u2212\n(e + 1) \u2212 2 \u03b3 2 .\nm\n2\n\n(3.24)\n(3.25)\n(3.26)\n\nTherefore, in case the backreaction presents, the oscillation of \u03c6 becomes faster and that of\n\u03c7 is compared slower. The non-vanishing \u03b7 gives a boost effect. Amplitudes \u03c6(t2 ) and |\u03c7|(t2 )\nare thus affected and become slightly different with their original values at t = 0, suggesting\nan energy transfer.\nWhenever one takes this backreaction into account, one should adopt these corrections.\nHowever for weak backreactions in which \u03b3 2 \u001c 1, the corrections actually can be neglected.\nSuch backreaction only comes to important when \u03b3 2 \u223c> 0.1. In some cases, however, the\nexponential boost effect is terminated by other causes before \u03b3 2 reaches 0.1, so it never comes\nto important.\nIf the system does evolve to \u03b3 2 \u223c> 0.1, one then needs to take it seriously. The most\nsignificant effect is \u03c6 oscillates faster and faster, due to the effective mass contribution from\nthe backreaction. This has several consequences. First and most obviously, because the\nboost rate is counted per half cycle of \u03c6, a faster rate of \u03c6's oscillation also leads to a faster\nboost to \u03c7. The faster boost acts back on \u03c6's effective mass and causes \u03c6 to oscillate even\nfaster. The positive feedback gives an explosive boost effect to \u03c7 once the backreaction\ncomes to important. The explosive boost effect is soon shut down when |\u03c7|m reaches the\nsame scale with |\u03c6|. This is because \u03c6 and \u03c7 would then have similar frequencies and the\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fapproximate replacement of \u03c72 with h\u03c72 i would be no longer applicable. This immediately\nends the exponential boost effect of parametric resonance.\nMoreover, this backreaction may also offer a major contribution to \u03b4 0 . Here we give\na simple estimate based on eq. (3.26). By definition, we have (\u03b3 2 )0 = 2\u03bb(|\u03c7|2m )0 /m2 =\n\u03b3 2 (e2\u03b7 \u2212 1). So the correction to \u03b4 0 up to first order of \u03b3 2 is\n\u221a\n\u0011\n2 2\u03bb|\u03c6|\u03b3 2 \u0010 \u03c0 4\u03b7+2\u03b70\n0\n\u2206\u03b4 = \u2212\n(e\n\u2212 1) \u2212 e2\u03b7 + 1 .\n(3.27)\nm\n2\nWhen it has the same magnitude with the originally defined \u03b4 0 in eq. (3.7) in an expanding\nuniverse, we can solve the magnitude of \u03b3 2 ,\n\u03b32 \u223c\n\nH\n< 0.1.\nm\n\n(3.28)\n\nThis means the impact of backreaction on rotation angle \u03b4 is even more noticeable than that\non \u03c6's period.\n\u221a\nIn the same way, it's easy to derive \u2206\u03b4 0 has unit magnitude when \u03b3 2 \u223c m/ \u03bb|\u03c6| \u001c\n1. Normally in an expanding universe where the backreaction is negligible, |\u03b4 0 | is always\ndecreasing so the resonance would gradually undergo a shift from the large \u03b4 0 stage to the\nsmall \u03b4 0 stage. The relation of \u03b3 2 however tells that the parametric resonance may be subject\nto a shift back to the large \u03b4 0 stage from the small \u03b4 0 stage, or even, the small \u03b4 0 stage may\nnot appear at all. The back shift, whenever exists, always lies ahead of the explosive boost.\nSo for deep discussions of the ending conditions of the exponential boost, one should always\ntake it into account.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nCosmological Applications\nPreheating\n\nPreheating is a possible stage after inflation, during which the inflaton decays into particles\nthrough parametric resonance. Preheating was first realized in [15, 16], and the parameter\nspace is the same with what we have discussed. Therefore, during preheating, the number\nof preheated particles grows exponentially, much faster than the redshift rate from universe\nexpansion.\nAlthough preheating should be followed by particle thermalization, and possibly a second stage of reheating between them, they are not within our consideration in this paper.\nInstead of calculating the reheating temperature and how long reheating and thermalization\nlast, this section is devoted to showing how this framework may be applied on specific preheating calculations. Details about the second stage of reheating and thermalization can be\nfound in [16] and [22]. For the same reason, we don't care the reheating ratio between the\ndark and visible sector. To solve the dark radiation problem, one might want to refer to\ninflation models with more particle physics foundation, e.g. SUSY inspired inflation and the\nsubsequent reheating and thermalization studies[23\u201325].\nDuring preheating, the universe is dominated by \u03c6 in our model, which is usually the\ninflaton. As a demonstration, we here just consider the simple case of the preheating of\na generic slowroll inflation with inflaton \u03c6. To solve problems like horizon and flatness,\ninflation requires an e-folding at least N \u2248 60. At the beginning of such slowroll inflations,\nthere should be \u03bb\u03c72 \u001c m2 . Otherwise there would be a significant decrease in \u03c6's effective\nmass and thus no inflation although \u03c6 would still be slowrolling.\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fIn general, the end of slowroll inflation is signaled by the destruction of the slowroll\ncondition of \u03c6, after which \u03c6 begins to oscillate and preheating takes place. We would like\nto neglect the first cycle or so of \u03c6 in the beginning of preheating here, so m\u03c6 \u001d H holds\nfor the rest of the preheating period. Because \u03bb\u03c72 \u001c m2 holds in the beginning of inflation,\nand \u03c7 is redshifted greatly during inflation, this relation is expected to still hold for a very\nlong period in preheating. Because the backreaction terminates parametric resonance once it\ncomes to important, it acts as an ending condition of the preheating scenario. Therefore we\ncan first neglect the presence of backreaction, and then calculate the take-over of backreaction\nseparately.\nWe label the beginning of inflation as 0, the end of inflation (i.e. the start of preheating)\nas 1, and the point we start to consider in preheating as 2. The evolution of the universe is\nthen divided by such points, whose labels we use as subscripts, into intervals such as 1 \u2192 2\nfor the convenience of future references. To be exact, we define the point 2 as\n|\u03c62 | \u2261 e\u22121 |\u03c61 |.\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c7 is redshifted during inflation (0 \u2192 1), but the boost and redshift effect approximately\ncancel during 1 \u2192 2. We therefore get\n3\n\n|\u03c72 | \u223c |\u03c71 | = e\u2212 2 N |\u03c70 |.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe universe is dominated by \u03c6 during preheating so the Hubble rate writes\nH2 =\n\n4\u03c0m2 |\u03c6|2\n3Mp2\n\n(4.3)\n\nin which for point 1 and after,\n|\u03c6| = |\u03c61 |\n\n\u0010a \u00113\n1\n\n2\n\n.\n(4.4)\na\nAfter point 2, the system starts at the large \u03b4 0 stage. There may be a transition from\nlarge to small \u03b4 0 stage during the evolution, but the termination of parametric resonance by\nbackreaction is certain to take place at the large \u03b4 0 stage, which is ensured by its influence\non \u03b4 0 shown in eq. (3.27), slightly before the positive feedback ends the exponential boost.\nWe thus also label the point after which the large \u03b4 0 is ensured by backreaction, and the\npoint backreaction becomes important and consequently terminates parametric resonance as\npoints 3 and 4, also in chronological order.\nAfter defining the timeline, we now work on the evolution of \u03c7. The large and small\n\u03b4 0 stages share the same average boost rate h\u03b7i, so after point 2, field \u03c7 is affected by\nh\u03b7i\n\nparametric resonance and becomes proportional to e \u03c0 m(t\u2212t2 ) . Due to universe expansion,\n3\n|\u03c7| is redshifted and thus acquires the factor (a2 /a) 2 . As we have demonstrated in section\n\u22121\n\n3\n\n2.1, |\u03c7| \u221d m\u03c6 2 , this gives |\u03c7|, from the redshift of \u03c6 field, another factor (a/a2 ) 4 . We\nmultiply them all together to get the statistically average evolution of field \u03c7\n\u0010 a \u0011 3 h\u03b7i\n2 4\n|\u03c7| = |\u03c72 |\ne \u03c0 m(t\u2212t2 ) .\n(4.5)\na\nIn a matter-like universe, we have for any time ta and tb ,\ns\n\u0012\n\u00133\na(tb ) 2\n6\u03c0\u03c1(ta )\n=1+\n(tb \u2212 ta ),\na(ta )\nMp2\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fwhich, under the condition log a(tb ) \u2212 log a(ta ) > 1, can be simplified to\n\u0012\ntb \u2212 ta =\n\na(tb )\na(ta )\n\n\u00133\n2\n\nMp\np\n6\u03c0\u03c1(ta )\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03c1(ta ) is the total energy density of the universe at time ta . Because \u03c6 dominates\npreheating, the evolution of |\u03c7| finally writes\n\u0012 \u00133\na2 4 32 B( aa ) 32\n2\n|\u03c7| = |\u03c72 |\ne\n,\na\nin which\nB\u2261\n\n2h\u03b7iMp\n3\n\n(3\u03c0) 2 |\u03c62 |\n\n.\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nFrom the above equation, we immediately see |\u03c7| is actually independent of \u03bb and m.\nIt's obvious |\u03c7| is \u03bb-independent from the constant boost rate. The dependence on m, the\nbare mass of \u03c6, is however canceled by the same m-dependence of \u03c1. This can be also viewed\nas m defines a time scale which both the Hubble rate and the boost rate of \u03c7 per time interval\nare proportional to.\nWe then derive the evolution of \u03c7 at points 3 and 4 which are defined from backreaction.\nHere we assume \u03c6 is the inflaton of a generic slowroll inflation of N e-folds. At the beginning\nof it, i.e. point 0, there should be \u03bb|\u03c70 |2 < m2 to allow inflation to happen. After being\nredshifted all along inflation, |\u03c71 | then becomes extremely small and this allows a safe period\nof preheating before the backreaction becomes important. After that, backreaction may\nget strong and, points 3 and 4 may be met in turn at any moment. To show the relation\n\u03bb|\u03c70 |2 < m2 , we deploy the parameter \u03b302 \u2261 \u03bb|\u03c70 |2 /m2 < 1. Here we want to give a\nconservative and natural estimation, so we assume \u2212100 < log \u03b30 < 0.\nAs we\u221ahave demonstrated in section 3.2 that backreaction ensures the large \u03b4 0 stage at\n2\n\u03b3 \u223c> m/ \u03bb|\u03c6|, we therefore define point 3 as\n\u03bb|\u03c73 |2\nm\n= \u03b332 \u2261 \u221a\n.\nm2\n\u03bb|\u03c63 |\n\n(4.10)\n\nGiven the evolution of both fields, eq. (4.4) and eq. (4.8), this can be reduced to the equation\nof N2\u21923 , the e-folding the universe experienced between point 2 and 3,\n3\n\nBe 2 N2\u21923 \u2212 N2\u21923 = N +\n\n1\nm2\nlog\n.\n6\n\u03bb|\u03c62 |2 \u03b304\n\n(4.11)\n\nAlso, we can work on point 4 in the same way. After defining point 4 as \u03bb|\u03c74 |2 \u2261 m2 ,\nthe calculation is straightforward to give\n3\n1\n2\nBe 2 N2\u21924 \u2212 N2\u21924 = N \u2212 log \u03b30 .\n2\n3\n\n(4.12)\n\nIn both of the above equations, the dominant term on the l.h.s is the exponential one.\nWe can thus see the number of e-folds of preheating is only very weakly dependent on \u03bb and\n\u03b30 , because they are inside two \"log\"s. This is because \u03c6 oscillates faster and faster as the\nuniverse expands, and in consequence \u03c7 acquires a much larger boost rate per Hubble time\nH \u22121 .\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fN\n4.41\n4.40\n4.39\n4.38\n4.37\n\n10-12\n\n10-10\n\n10-8\n\n10-6\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n\n102\n\n\u039b\n\nFigure 10. N2\u21923 and N2\u21924 as functions of \u03bb. Blue and purple correspond to N2\u21923 and N2\u21924\nrespectively. It's easy to see on the figure that N2\u21923 is only weakly dependent on \u03bb and N2\u21924 is\nindependent of \u03bb. Parameters are chosen to accord with the quadratic slowroll inflationary model.\n\nTo provide a brief example, we take the simple case of quadratic slowroll inflation which\nends at |\u03c61 |2 = 27Mp2 /16\u03c0, and has the number of e-folds of inflation N = 60. We also need\nthe value m \u223c 10\u22126 Mp , which comes from the strength of observed CMB anisotropy. Figure\n10 shows the relations N2\u21923 and N2\u21924 have with \u03bb at constant \u03b30 = 0.1. The dependence\nof \u03b30 is weak, and a smaller \u03b30 simply shifts both N2\u21923 and N2\u21924 upwards a bit with the\nsame amount. For \u03b30 = e\u2212100 , there is N2\u21924 = 4.86.\nFrom eq. (4.12), we can also calculate the value of the r.h.s from N2\u21924 . For N2\u21924 = 4\nand 5 respectively, there is N \u2212 23 log \u03b30 = 32 and 155. As a result, for most cases where N\nis not very large and \u03b30 is not too small, preheating is typically ended by backreaction at\nthe 5th e-fold of parametric resonance i.e. the 6th e-fold after inflation, provided no other\nmechanism terminates preheating before that.\nIn section 3.2, we have suggested the correction from backreaction to \u03b4 0 always comes\nto important earlier than that to m\u03c6 . In figure 10, it agrees with large \u03bb. For small \u03bb,\nthe figure suggests a reverse in their sequence. The reverse however actually reflects the\nviolation of \u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 . For values of \u03bb on the left of the intersection point of the two curves\nin figure 10, the condition \u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 should be broken well ahead of point 4 being reached,\nso the behavior of the system afterwards in fact can't be predicted by our theory. This\nindicates another possible\nexit of parametric resonance, which is caused by a small |\u03c6| that is\n\u221a\ncomparable to m/ \u03bb. We label this exit as subscript a, and from the relation \u03bb|\u03c6a |2 \u2261 m2 ,\nwe can easily derive the e-folding\nN2\u2192a =\n\n1\n\u03bb|\u03c62 |2\nlog\n.\n3\nm2\n\n(4.13)\n\nSince both point a and 4 act as exits of parametric resonance, it is important to know\nwhich point comes earlier to find out by who and when parametric resonance is terminated.\nBy setting N2\u21924 = N2\u2192a , calculations give a critical value for \u03bb\n\u03bba \u2248\n\n(N \u2212 23 log \u03b30 )2 m2\n\u223c 10\u22125 .\nB 2 |\u03c62 |2\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fFor \u03bb > \u03bba , parametric resonance ends with backreaction. The amplitudes of \u03c6 and \u03c7 reach\nthe same scale of magnitude in the end and equilibrium may be reached between the two fields.\nFor \u03bb < \u03bba however, parametric resonance is terminated by the violation of \u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 . In\nthis case, the evolution afterwards is not characterized by our theory, and we only know\nat the time this condition is broken, equilibrium has not yet been reached. Moreover, for\n\u03bb < m2 /|\u03c62 |2 , there is N2\u2192a < 0. This indicates the condition of our framework is not\nsatisfied and such a parametric resonance does not take place immediately after inflation.\nMeanwhile, we are also interested in the transition point from the large \u03b4 0 stage to the\nsmall \u03b4 0 stage. In the context of preheating, \u03b4 0 is defined as\n3\u221a\n2\u03c0 2 6\u03bb|\u03c6|2\n0\n\u03b4 \u2261\u2212\n.\n(4.15)\nmMp\nWhen \u03b4 0 reaches e\u22122 \u223c 0.1, we think the transition takes place and label it as point b. We\nthus derive the e-folding from point 2 to b\n3\u221a\n1\n2e2 \u03c0 2 6\u03bb|\u03c62 |2\nN2\u2192b = log\n.\n(4.16)\n3\nmMp\nFor N2\u2192b > N2\u2192a , parametric resonance is terminated before the transition point, so\nthe whole process is large \u03b4 0 . Similarly if N2\u2192b > N2\u21923 , the large \u03b4 0 stage is also guaranteed\nso no small \u03b4 0 stage takes place. For N2\u2192b < 0, parametric resonance starts from the small \u03b4 0\nstage, and whether a large \u03b4 0 stage presents (although very short) depends on how preheating\nis terminated.\nTo conclude this subsection, we perform a more precise calculation of the parametric\nresonance of quadratic slowroll inflation, and give figure 11 which divides the parameter\nspace of \u03bb and \u03b30 into five sections. The small \u03b4 0 stage may either exist or not exist for\nthe terminations by both backreaction and the small |\u03c6|. There is also the case that no\nparametric resonance shall take place within our framework, so in all there are five sections.\nThe numbers of the total e-folds of parametric resonance and the e-folds of the small \u03b4 0 stage\nare also contoured in figure 11. For the termination by small |\u03c6| however, the reheating\nis incomplete and there should be a subsequent decay of inflaton after the termination of\nparametric resonance, but our theory is unable to characterize it. From the figure, we also\nconfirm that if preheating is terminated by backreaction, it should typically happen at the\n5th e-fold of preheating, i.e. the 6th e-fold after inflation.\n4.2\n\nLocked Inflation\n\nLocked inflation, or new old inflation[9], is a fastroll inflation scenario during which a fastroll\nfield \u03c6 locks the other field \u03c7 at its false vacuum. The false vacuum has a nonzero energy\ndensity which drives inflation. Locked inflation has the same potential shape with hybrid\ninflation[5], but the parameter configuration is different.\nNot long after the proposal of locked inflation, however, opposite opinions are posted\nsuggesting underlying problems[20, 26]. In [20], they concluded that saddle inflation, loop\ncorrection and parametric resonance problems eliminates part of the parameter space each,\nwhile they three together kill all possible parameter configurations. At least one of those\nproblems therefore has to be fixed to make locked inflation work again. During locked\ninflation, parametric resonance is disfavored for its exponentially growing energy transfer\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f10-12\n1\n\n10-10\n\n10-8\n\n10-6\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n\n102\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4.4\n\n10-5\n\n10-5\n\n10-10\n\n10-10\n\n3\n0.6\n\n10-15\n\n10-15\n\n\u03930\n\n4.6\n\n10-20\n\n10-20\n2\n\n0.3\n\n10-25\n\n10-25\n0.6\n\n10-30\n\n10-30\n0.3\n\n4\n\n-35\n\n10\n\n10-35\n\n1.2\n\n10-40\n\n4.8\n\n10-40\n\n0.9\n1\n\n10-12\n\n10-10\n\n0\n\n10-8\n\n10-6\n\n10-4\n\n10-2\n\n1\n\n102\n\n\u039b\nFigure 11. The different circumstances of preheating in the parameter space of \u03bb and \u03b30 . The\ngreen and red regions are backreaction termination with and without the small \u03b4 0 stage respectively.\nThe blue and orange regions are terminated by the small |\u03c6|, with and without the small \u03b4 0 stage\ncorrespondingly. In the gray region, the preheating stage is not entered after inflation. Among the\ndashed lines, the number of total e-folds of parametric resonance is contoured in black and that of\nthe small \u03b4 0 stage is contoured in red.\n\nfrom \u03c6 field to \u03c7, so it acts as a problem here which may end locked inflation much earlier\nthan expected.\nFrom our above analysis of the mechanism of parametric resonance, we infer for \u03c6 with\nmore than one real component, parametric resonance is inhibited. This solves the parametric\nresonance problem of locked inflation and makes it possible. Such an argument comes from\neq. (2.5), the condition of rolling stage. For \u03c6 singlet, m2\u03c7 is dominated by \u03bb\u03c62 so this\ncondition breaks when \u03c6 is approaching zero. Only when eq. (2.5) breaks, \u03c6 would enter the\nzero-crossing stage and perform the exponential boost. If \u03bb\u03c62 isn't the absolute dominant of\nm2\u03c7 , eq. (2.5) would never break down and the zero-crossing stage would never be entered,\neven if \u03c6 = 0. For \u03c6 multiplets, every component of \u03c6 interacts with \u03c7 independently. So\nwhen one component crosses zero, other components are in general nonzero and they provide\n\u03c7 with a large effective mass. The zero-crossing component thus never dominates and eq.\n(2.5) never breaks.\nAs an example, we take a \u03c6 doublet, whose components are \u03c61 , \u03c62 . For demonstration,\nwe simply assume they have an identical amplitude |\u03c6| but a phase difference \u03c02 \u2212 2\u03c6. So\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fthey can be written as\n\u03c61 = |\u03c6| cos(m\u03c6 t \u2212 \u03c6),\n\n(4.17)\n\n\u03c62 = |\u03c6| sin(m\u03c6 t + \u03c6).\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe effective mass squared of \u03c7 then becomes\nm \u0303\u03c7 2 \u2261 M 2 + 2\u03bb(\u03c621 + \u03c622 ) = M 2 + 2\u03bb|\u03c6|2 (1 + sin 2\u03c6 sin 2m\u03c6 t),\n\n(4.19)\n\nequivalent to the singlet case with transformed M 2 \u2192 M\u0303 2 = M 2 + 2\u03bb|\u03c6|2 , \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb\u0303 = \u03bb sin 2\u03c6\nand m\u03c6 \u2192 m\u0303\u03c6 = 2m\u03c6 .\nThe equivalent singlet case however has the relation \u03bb\u0303|\u03c6|2 < M\u0303 2 , which breaks the\nassumption \u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 \u001d M 2 . In such cases, the condition of rolling stage eq. (2.5) would\nnever break, and the parametric resonance effect would then be inhibited.\nIn general cases where |\u03c61 | 6= |\u03c62 | but |\u03c61 | \u223c |\u03c62 |, there are also similar results, which\ntypically have M\u0303 2 \u223c 0.1\u03bb\u0303(|\u03c61 |2 + |\u03c62 |2 ). For the same reason, eq. (2.5) would never break\nand locked inflation can last long enough for \u03c6 multiplets. Therefore for \u03c6 multiplets, the\nparametric resonance \"problem\" of locked inflation is not actually a problem. Of course,\nthis doesn't solve the problem of embedding locked inflation in some particle physics theory.\nHowever, one still needs a viable particle physics setup (or a convincing argument about the\ndecay to visible sector) to make locked inflation promising. This is beyond the coverage of\nthis paper.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion of Inhomogeneity Amplification\n\nThe cosmic inhomogeneity, if arose from the inflaton, may get amplified by parametric resonance during the large \u03b4 0 stage. The amplification also requires a change in the equation\nof state of the universe that is triggered directly or determined indirectly by the total boost\nrate of |\u03c7|. This process is similar to modulated perturbations discuss in [27]. The difference\nhere is the decay rate is determined by the relative phase difference between the inflaton and\nthe preheated field, i.e. both fields instead of the inflaton only.\nTo explicate the whole process, we start with two points at a distance 1/k. In the\nbeginning of inflation, they live within a Hubble radius, so homogenous \u03c7 is assumed. After\nthe mode k leaves horizon, the two points become uncorrelated and the phases of \u03c7 at the two\npoints start to differ because of the inhomogeneity \u03b4\u03c6k which causes different m\u03c7 's. Also, as\nwe choose the end of inflation at a specific value of \u03c6 on the uniform-density hypersurface, the\npoint with a slightly larger \u03c6 would also gain a slightly longer inflation. For both reasons, at\nthe point where \u03c6 is larger, the phase that \u03c7 experiences would also be larger. This transfers\ninhomogeneity to \u03c7's phase from \u03c6's energy density.\nAfter inflation, the universe enters the large \u03b4 0 stage. Due to statistical reasons, the\ntotal transformation matrix of the whole large \u03b4 0 stage would be an ellipse with the average total boost rate h\u03aei and the difference between the major and minor axes of the scale\n2\u2206h\u03aei. Different initial phases of \u03c7 then correspond to different total boost rates, i.e. different parametric resonance efficiencies. If there exists a transition of the equation of state\ndepending on the efficiency of parametric resonance, like the backreaction end which changes\nthe universe from matter-like to radiation-like when \u03bb|\u03c7|2 \u223c m2 , additional inhomogeneity\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fmay be generated.3 At points where the efficiency is lower for example, more time is needed\nto boost \u03c7 to the amplitude required for the transition in the equation of state to take place,\nand subsequently the entrance into a different equation of state is delayed. Therefore there\nare regions which stay in the larger equation of state longer and suffer a heavier redshift\ndue to universe expansion, and also regions which enjoy a weaker redshift. The difference in\nredshift rates finally leads to different energy densities at different places, and thus additional\ncurvature perturbation on the uniform-density hypersurface. If the effect is stronger than\nthe existing inhomogeneity, we will find inhomogeneity amplified in this process.\nTo calculate, we start from inflation in which the inhomogeneity transfers from \u03c6 to\nthe phase of \u03c7. We still adopt the two points at the distance 1/k and difference in \u03c6 at the\nhorizon exit of mode k as \u03b4\u03c6k . Because we use a universal ending condition for inflation, we\nalign the evolution history of the two points at the end of inflation. Then the only difference\n\u03b4\u03c6k causes to the phase of \u03c7 is one point enjoys an additional period of inflation as the\nfield \u03c6 rolls from \u03c6 + \u03b4\u03c6k to \u03c6, and this gives an additional phase to \u03c7. Using the slowroll\napproximation, the resulting phase difference can be calculated\nr\n\u221a\n\u03b4\u03c6k\n3\u03bb 3Mp Hk2 \u03b4\u03c6k\n\u2206\u03c6 \u2261 2\u03bb \u03c6\n,\n(5.1)\n=\n2\u03c0 m3\n\u03c6k\n\u03c6\u0307k\nwhere we use the subscript k to represent values at the horizon exit of mode k.\nDuring the large \u03b4 0 stage, the parametric resonance process is approximated as stochastic. So we acquire the statistical result of the average total boost rate h\u03aei and its statistical\nerror \u2206h\u03aei, which are defined in eq. (3.12) and eq. (3.14) and are functions of n, the number\nof half cycles of \u03c6 during the large \u03b4 0 stage. If we consider the total transformation matrix\nof the whole large \u03b4 0 stage which transforms a circle of unity to an ellipse, h\u03aei can also be\nunderstood as the typical average total boost rate of the ellipse and \u2206h\u03aei as half of the typical\ndifference of the total boost rate between the major and minor axes.\nNow we have the ellipse as the total boost rate function of the initial phase. The total\nboost rate goes from maximum to minimum with a change of initial phase \u03c0/2, so the phase\ndifference \u2206\u03c6 would give a difference in the total boost rate, and thus a difference in the\nnumber of half cycles of \u03c6 needed to reach the same amplitude |\u03c7|. For \u2206\u03c6 < 1, we have the\nnumber of additional half cycles\n\u2206n =\n\n2\u2206\u03c6 2\u2206h\u03aei\n.\n\u03c0\nh\u03b7i\n\n(5.2)\n\nThen \u2206n leads to delayed or advanced transition of the equation of state. Let us suppose\nthe equation of state is changed by \u2206w. The resulting inhomogeneity is then\nr\n\u03b4\u03c1k\n\u2206n\u03c0\n6\u03bb 18\u2206wMp HHk2 \u2206h\u03aei \u03b4\u03c6k\n\u2261\n3\u2206wH =\n,\n(5.3)\n\u03c1k\nm\n\u03c0\nm4\nh\u03b7i \u03c6k\nwhere H here is the Hubble rate at the transition of the equation of state.\n3\n\nDuring preheating, the universe is matter-like because \u03c6 dominates with its energy density proportional\nto a\u22123 . For preheating ended by backreaction, the dominant potential term becomes \u03bb\u03c62 \u03c72 . Therefore \u03c6 and\n\u03c7 have the same redshift rate. With their redshift rate a\u22123 for constant-mass fields, and their scaling relation\nwith effective mass eq. (2.11), we can conclude both fields are proportional to a\u22122 . This gives the energy\ndensity \u03bb|\u03c6|2 |\u03c7|2 \u221d a\u22124 and thus a radiation-like universe. This result is also numerically verified in [28].\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fIf we don't want it to overwhelm the existing inhomogeneity \u03b4\u03c6k /\u03c6k , we then need it\nto be smaller than that, which gives\nr\n6\u03bb 18\u2206wMp HHk2 \u2206h\u03aei\n< 1,\n(5.4)\n\u03c0\nm4\nh\u03b7i\nand consequently,\n\u03c0m8\nh\u03b7i2\n.\n1944\u2206w2 Mp2 H 2 Hk4 \u2206h\u03aei2\n\n\u03bb<\n\n(5.5)\n\nFor \u2206\u03c6 > 1, we have instead\n\u2206n =\n\n2\u2206h\u03aei\n,\nh\u03b7i\n\n(5.6)\n\nwhich generates the inhomogeneity\n6\u03c0\u2206wH \u2206h\u03aei\n\u03b4\u03c1k\n=\n.\n\u03c1k\nm\nh\u03b7i\n\n(5.7)\n\n\u2206h\u03aei/h\u03b7i is at least 1 and increases as the large \u03b4 0 stage continues; \u2206w \u223c 31 . To make\n\u03b4\u03c1k /\u03c1k < 10\u22125 , we therefore need at least 8 e-folds before the transition to get a small enough\nH, which is hardly possible for a quadratic slowroll inflation, unless we have thousands of\ne-folds of inflation to redshift \u03c7.\nSo we will still focus on the \u2206\u03c6 < 1 case. If we consider the cosmic scale whose\n\u03b4\u03c6k /\u03c6k \u223c 10\u22125 and Hk2 \u223c 10m2 , we can see from eq. (5.1) the constraint from \u2206\u03c6 < 1\nis already quite strong. For the backreaction end of preheating of the quadratic slowroll\ninflation, there is \u03bb < 10\u22126 .\nHowever the constraint from eq. (5.5) is even stronger. At the backreaction end, the\nequation of state switches from 0 to 13 , so \u2206w = 13 . For the preheating fully consisted of the\nlarge \u03b4 0 stage, we can simplify part of eq. (5.5) to a function of N2\u21924 only\n\u221a\n3\n3 3\u03c0 Mp h\u03b7i2\nm2 h\u03b7i2\n=\ne 2 N2\u21924 .\n(5.8)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nH \u2206h\u03aei\n4|\u03c62 |(h\u03b7 i \u2212 h\u03b7i )\nSo eq. (5.5) becomes\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb<\n\n3\n3\u03c0m6\nh\u03b7i2\ne 2 N2\u21924 .\n4\n2\n2\n2592Mp |\u03c62 |Hk h\u03b7 i \u2212 h\u03b7i\n\n(5.9)\n\nHere we simply choose N2\u21924 = 4.5 and Hk2 = 10m2 to get the numerical value \u03bb < 10\u221214 .\nIf we want the result \u03bb < 10\u22125 , from which we can reserve a tiny living space for the\nbackreaction end as shown in figure 11, we would need N2\u21924 > 18, which means more than\n1010 e-folds of inflation. For the backreaction end with both the large and small \u03b4 0 stages\nduring preheating but the same e-folding of the large \u03b4 0 stage, the constraint is even stronger.\nSuch a strong constraint basically rules out the backreaction end of preheating for the\nquadratic slowroll inflation, unless additional techniques are taken. The attempt of using a\ndynamic \u03bb to solve this problem is also difficult, because that would require \u03bb < 10\u221214 during\ninflation, which makes \u03c7 also slowrolling. For natural initial conditions, one then needs to\ndeal with a very large \u03c7 field after inflation which doesn't even need parametric resonance\nto become large. This however disagrees with our initial purpose of choosing \u03c7 as the first\nlevel decay product of \u03c6. Therefore, we infer that the first level of decay of the inflaton of\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fquadratic slowroll inflation is insufficient for reaching a chemical equilibrium between the two\ntypes of particles, if we still adopt \u03b4\u03c6/\u03c6 \u223c 10\u22125 at the cosmic scale.\nOne may, however, assume inflation only generated a much weaker inhomogeneity and\npreheating then amplified it to the proper amount. To get a weaker inhomogeneity, we need\nto change the mass m. In order to benefit from the scaling property, we will still use m0\nto indicate the old m which alone can get the proper inhomogeneity during inflation. On\nthe r.h.s of eq. (5.3), H and Hk are both proportional to m, and \u03b4\u03c6k /\u03c6k \u221d m2 , so the r.h.s\nas a whole is proportional to m, while the l.h.s is the desired inhomogeneity and should be\nkept unchanged. We can absorb the dependence on m into \u03bb for the rest of the calculation,\nand drag it out in eq. (5.5). If nothing else is modified, we would get a similar result\n\u03bbm2 /m20 \u223c 10\u221214 . Still if we want \u03bb \u223c 10\u22125 , this would require m \u223c 10\u221211 Mp . Also, because\nthe amplification rate is the term on the l.h.s of eq. (5.3) before \u03b4\u03c6k /\u03c6k which has Hk2 in it,\nthe amplification is scale dependent. Different length scales leave horizon at different Hubble\nrates which consequently give different inhomogeneity transfer rates. This comes from the\ndifferent amounts of phase differences of \u03c7, which are only generated at their corresponding\nhorizon exits. Therefore, the scale dependence further adds \u22122\u000f to the spectral index for this\nd 1\ncase, providing \u000f \u2261 dt\nH is the slowroll parameter.\nFor generic cases, we just need to redefine \u2206\u03c6. Still aligning every point at the end of\ninflation and assuming the only difference the inhomogeneity of inflaton gives on \u03c7's phase\nis a slightly longer or shorter inflation, we can then define it as \u2206\u03c6 \u2261 hm\u03c7 i\u2206t. Here hm\u03c7 i\nis the average m\u03c7 during the additional inflationary period \u2206t caused by the inhomogeneity\nof the inflaton. For short, we use \u03b4k \u2261 \u03b4\u03c1k /\u03c1 as the energy density inhomogeneity at horizon\nexit. The time difference of inflation can then be written as\n\u2206t = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03c1k dt\n\u03b4k dt\n\u03b4k\n=\u2212\n=\n,\nd\u03c1\nd log \u03c1\n2Hk \u000fk\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere again the subscript k indicates the value at horizon exit of mode k. So the inhomogeneity arose from parametric resonance, represented as \u03b4\u0303k , should be\n\u03b4\u0303k =\n\n6\u2206wH \u2206h\u03aei hm\u03c7 ik\n\u03b4k .\nm\u03c6 h\u03b7i Hk \u000fk\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe amplification rate then should be the terms on the r.h.s before \u03b4k (for \u2206\u03c6 < 1).\nAlthough we have only given one example, this constraint has basically ruled out the\nbackreaction end of parametric resonance in preheating for m \u223c 10\u22126 . This constraint is\nalso quite strong in general cases, as long as all of the following criteria are met so that the\nconstraint is applicable.\n1. The inflaton has some inhomogeneity after the horizon exit.\n2. There is a period of large \u03b4 0 stage during the first level decay of the inflaton.\n3. A transition of the equation of state of the universe is a direct or indirect consequence\nof the first level decay product's reaching a critical density.\nThis constraint however doesn't apply to the small \u03b4 0 stage, because all phases converge\nto the same one in the small \u03b4 0 stage. Nor does it apply to perturbative reheating, etc. The\nconstraint doesn't affect models without any transition in the equation of state, such as the\ninflaton behaves like radiation after inflation which has the same equation of state with the\ninteraction term.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\f6\n\nSummary\n\nIn this article, we have established an analytic framework for the homogeneous mode of\nparametric resonance in a particular parameter space. In a static background, the Mathieu\nequation is analytically solved to give the stable and unstable bands. In an expanding\nuniverse, distinct stages of large and small \u03b4 0 are separately considered. At the large \u03b4 0 stage,\nthe phase \u03c7 experiences for every half cycle of \u03c6 is regarded as random and independent\nof the history, like the Markov chain. During the small \u03b4 0 stage, all states with different\nphases converge to the same eigenstate which is slowly varying. In this eigenstate, |\u03c7| enjoys\na stair-like growth. Both stages share the same average boost rate h\u03b7i = 0.346. The effect of\nbackreaction is considered, in which a positive feedback acts as the terminator of parametric\nresonance once it takes over m\u03c6 . We also find the backreaction has an impact on \u03b4 0 which\ncomes to important earlier than the m\u03c6 take-over and guarantees a short large \u03b4 0 stage before\nthe backreaction exit of parametric resonance.\nApplying it on preheating, we have constructed a timeline starting from the beginning\nof inflation till the backreaction exit. Taking the quadratic slowroll model as an example,\nthe large \u03b4 0 guarantee point and the transition point from large to small \u03b4 0 are included. The\nviolation of \u03bb|\u03c6|2 \u001d m2 has also been considered as another exit of parametric resonance,\nnamely the small |\u03c6| exit. Regarding to how parametric resonance is terminated and whether\na small \u03b4 0 stage presents, we divide the parameter space of \u03bb and \u03b30 into four parts. The\nbackreaction exit typically takes place during the 5th e-fold of preheating for slowroll models\nwith e-folding 60.\nHowever in a subsequent discussion, we have found parametric resonance during preheating can be responsible in amplifying inhomogeneity. To avoid conflict with current CMB\nspectrum, it acts as both a constraint on parameter space for some inflationary models, and\nan amplifier to the weak inhomogeneity of some other models which are otherwise disfavored.\nWe have also set up a demonstration by ruling out the backreaction end of preheating of the\nquadratic slowroll inflation with mass 10\u22126 . Amplification rate for general cases is calculated,\nand criteria of applicability of this effect is explained.\nOn the other hand, the parametric resonance problem of locked inflation isn't a problem\nfor \u03c6 multiplets. This is because when one component of \u03c6 crosses zero, the contribution\nfrom other components on m\u03c7 would be strong and consequently prevent the exponential\nboost effect.\nThis paper aims to show an alternative framework for the broad resonance. For this\nreason, we don't specify the particle physics model and only use singlets. We also show the\npreheating stage for quadratic slowroll inflation only as an demonstration, without calculating\nthe reheating temperature and thermalization, or discussing difficulties of inflationary models,\nsuch as the visible v.s. dark sector or how to embed locked inflation in a particle physics\nfoundation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Yeuk-kwan Edna Cheung and Yun Zhang for extensive discussions\nand Anupam Mazumdar for helpful suggestions on the draft.
