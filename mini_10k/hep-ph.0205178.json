KALINOWSKI\nInstitute of Theoretical Physics, Warsaw University\nHo\u017ca 69, 00681 Warsaw, Poland\n\nIt is shown how the fundamental gaugino and higgsino parameters of the chargino and neutralino system in the MSSM can completely be determined in high\u2013precision experiments at\ne+ e\u2212 linear colliders even if in their initial phase only the light charginos \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 and the light\nneutralinos \u03c7\u030301 and \u03c7\u030302 are kinematically accessible.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the light chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 and the two light\n1\n0\n0\nneutralinos \u03c7\u03031 and \u03c7\u03032 are expected to be among the lightest supersymmetric particles. The\nlightest neutralino \u03c7\u030301 is commonly assumed to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), stable in the\nR-parity conserving case, and invisible. The chargino and neutralino masses are given in terms\nof the fundamental parameters in the gaugino/higgsino sector, the U(1) and SU(2) gaugino\nmasses M1 and M2 , the higgsino mass \u03bc, and the ratio of Higgs vacuum expectation values\ntan \u03b2. If |\u03bc| << |M1 |, |M2 |, the light chargino and light neutralinos are higgsino-dominated and\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u223c m\u03c7\u03030 \u223c m\u03c7\u03030 . In the opposite, gaugino-dominated case, m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u223c m\u03c7\u03030 \u223c 2m\u03c7\u03030 is expected\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\ne.g. if the gaugino masses unify at high scale in supergravity inspired scenarios. Thus \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 and\n0\n0\n\u03c7\u03032 cannot be much heavier than the LSP \u03c7\u03031 . Therefore one can envisage a scenario in which\n0\n0\nin the initial phase of future e+ e\u2212 colliders, only the \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 , \u03c7\u03031 and \u03c7\u03032 states will be accessed\nkinematically with all other supersymmetric particles being too heavy to be produced. The\nquestion then arises, which we address here, to what extend the fundamental SUSY parameters\nof the gaugino/higgsino sector can be reconstructed from the initially limited experimental input.\nIt has been demonstrated in the literature2,3 that if all chargino and neutralino states are\naccessible experimentally, the measurement of their masses and production cross sections with\npolarized e+ e\u2212 beams allows us to derive the parameters M1 , M2 , \u03bc and tan \u03b2 analytically at\n\n\ftree level.a Here I will report how these parameters can nevertheless be determined with the\nlimited experimental input available form light charginos and light neutralinos produced in pairs\nin e+ e\u2212 collisions\n\u2212\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 ,\n\n\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302\n\n(1)\n\nwith visible final states.\n2\n\nThe Chargino System\n\nDefining the mixing angles in the unitary matrices diagonalizing the chargino mass matrix by \u03c6L\nand \u03c6R for the left\u2013 and right\u2013chiral fields, the fundamental SUSY parameters M2 , |\u03bc|, cos \u03a6\u03bc\nand tan \u03b2 can be derived from the chargino masses and c2L,2R = cos 2\u03c6L,R ,\nM2 = mW\n\nq\n\n\u03a3 \u2212 \u2206 (c2L + c2R )\n\n(2)\n\n|\u03bc| = mW\n\nq\n\n\u03a3 + \u2206 (c2L + c2R )\n\n(3)\n\ncos \u03a6\u03bc =\ntan \u03b2 =\n\n\u22062 (2 \u2212 c22L \u2212 c22R ) \u2212 \u03a3\n[1 \u2212 \u22062 (c2L \u2212 c2R )2 ] [\u03a32 \u2212 \u22062 (c2L + c2R )2 ]\n\n(4)\n\n[1 \u2212 \u2206(c2L \u2212 c2R )]/[1 + \u2206(c2L \u2212 c2R )]\n\n(5)\n\np\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03a3 = (m2\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 + m2\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u2212 2m2W )/2m2W and \u2206 = (m2\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u2212 m2\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 )/4m2W . The cos 2\u03c6L,R can be\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u2212\ndetermined uniquely5,6 from the measurement of cross sectionsb \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 ) at one energy\nwith polarized beams including transverse beam polarization, or else if only longitudinal beam\npolarization is available, they are measured at two different incoming energies.\n\u00b1\nIf only the light charginos \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 can be produced, the mass of \u03c7\u03032 remains unknown. Then it\ndepends on the CP properties of the higgsino sector whether the parameters of eqs.(2\u20135) can be\ndetermined or not in the chargino system alone.\n(i) If \u03bc is real, as suggested by the electric dipole moments, eq.(4) can be exploited to determine\nm\u03c7\u03032 \u00b1 from cos \u03a6\u03bc = \u00b11 up to at most a two\u2013fold ambiguity.5,6\n2\n\n(ii) If \u03bc is complex, the parameters in eqs.(2\u20135) cannot be determined in the chargino sector\nalone. However, they can be calculated as functions of the unknown heavy chargino mass m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 .\n2\nActually, there are two classes of solutions corresponding to the two values \u03a6\u03bc and (2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03a6\u03bc )\nfor the phase of the higgsino mass parameter, i.e. the sign of sin \u03a6\u03bc .c Although the heavy\nchargino mass is still unknown, its range is bounded from above by eq.(5), and from below by\nnot observing the heavy chargino in mixed light\u2212heavy pair production\n1\n2\n\n\u221a\n\ns \u2212 m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u2264 m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u2264 ( m\u03c7\u03032 \u00b1 + 4m2W /| cos 2\u03c6L \u2212 cos 2\u03c6R |)1/2\n1\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\nTo resolve the two\u2013fold ambiguity in case (i), and to fix the heavy chargino mass in case (ii)\nother observables are needed. It is interesting to note that in solving both cases the mixed\u2013pair\n\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 production process can be used since at the same time the U(1) gaugino mass parameter\nM1 can be determined.\na\n\nFor precision measurements, however, loop corrections will have to be included bringing in all soft SUSY\nbreaking parameters and ultimately one will have to rely on a global fit to all experimental data.\nb\nThe cross sections for processes (1) depend on the sneutrino and selectron masses which we assume, for the\nsake of simplicity, to be measured elsewhere.\nc\nThis phase ambiguity can be resolved by measuring the sign of CP\u2013odd observables, e.g. associated with\nnormal \u03c7\u030302 polarization in \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 pair production.7\n\n\f3\n\nThe Neutralino System\n\nThe symmetric neutralino mass matrix is diagonalized by a unitary matrix, defined such that\nthe mass eigenvalues of the four Majorana fields \u03c7\u03030i are positive. The squared mass eigenvalues\nof the neutralinos are solutions of the characteristic equations 2\nm8\u03c7\u03030 \u2212 a m\u03c7\u03036 0 + b m4\u03c7\u03030 \u2212 c m\u03c7\u03032 0 + d = 0 for\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\ni\n\n(7)\n\nwith the invariants a, b, c and d given by the gaugino mass parameters M2 and M1 , and the\nhiggsino mass parameter \u03bc, i.e. the moduli M2 , |M1 |, |\u03bc| and the phases \u03a61 , \u03a6\u03bc . Since a,\nb, c and d are binomials of ReM1 = |M1 | cos \u03a61 and ImM1 = |M1 | sin \u03a61 , the characteristic\nequation (7) for each neutralino mass has the form\n(ReM1 )2 + (ImM1 )2 + ui ReM1 + vi ImM1 = wi\n\nfor\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n(8)\n\nThe coefficients ui , vi and wi are functions of the parameters M2 , |\u03bc|, \u03a6\u03bc , tan \u03b2 and the mass\neigenvalue m\u03c7\u03032 0 for fixed i. The coefficient vi is necessarily proportional to sin \u03a6\u03bc because physi\nical neutralino masses are CP\u2013even: sin \u03a6\u03bc = 0 implies a sign ambiguity in the CP\u2013odd quantity ImM1 , i.e. in sin \u03a61 . Therefore the characteristic equation (8) defines a circle in the\n{ReM1 , ImM1 } plane for each neutralino mass m\u03c7\u03030 . With two known light neutralino masses\ni\nm\u03c7\u03030 and m\u03c7\u03030 , we have two circles which cross at two points, see left panel of Fig 1.\n2\n1\nNow we are in position to solve cases (i) and (ii) discussed above.\n(i) For \u03bc real, the two\u2013fold ambiguity for M2 , \u03bc and tan \u03b2 can be resolved by checking which\ncombination provides two crossing circles, i.e. is consistent with the measured neutralino masses\nand production cross section. At the same time |M1 | is determined with a remaining two\u2013fold\nambiguity for ImM1 .\n(ii) For \u03bc complex, the position of two circles in the {ReM1 , ImM1 } plane, and therefore their\ncrossings, will migrate as functions of the unknown heavy chargino mass, see right panel of\nFig. 1. By comparing the predicted with the measured pair\u2013production cross sections \u03c3L {\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 }\nand \u03c3R {\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 }, a unique solution, for both the parameters m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 and ReM1 , ImM1 can be found.\n2\nAs a result, the additional measurement of the cross sections leads to a unique solution for m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n2\nand subsequently to a unique solution for M1 , M2 , \u03bc and tan \u03b2 (assuming that the discrete CP\nambiguity is resolved, see footnote c).\n4\n\nExtracting the Fundamental Parameters\n\nThe strategy described above is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Right: Migration of the crossing points in the {ReM1 , ImM1 }\nplane, as functions of the heavy chargino mass (the small open circles are spaced by 5 GeV). The unique solution\nis determined by the measurement of the pair\u2013production cross sections (marked by the black dot). From ref.2 .\n\n\u221a\n\u2212\nat s = 500 GeV are sufficiently large (between \u223c 7 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 103 events for \u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u03c7\u03031 and\n\u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 can be expected at TESLA4 ), allowing the analysis of the properties of the chargino \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1\nand the neutralinos \u03c7\u030301,2 with high precision.\nTo summarize. If only the light chargino and the two light neutralinos can be accessed\nkinematically in the initial phase of e+ e\u2212 linear colliders, measurements of their masses and\nproduction cross sections with polarized beams, and \u03c7\u030302 polarization in the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030302 ,\nallow us to perform a complete and precise analysis of the basic MSSM parameters in the\ngaugino/higgsino sector: (M1 , M2 ; \u03bc; tan \u03b2).
