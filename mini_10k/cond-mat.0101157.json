INTRODUCTION\n\nWhich\u2013path devices such as the canonical two\u2013slit interference experiment, where a\nmeasurement is made of the path a particle takes, have a long history going back as far\nas the early debates about complementarity.1,2 Recent interest in their investigation has\nbeen stimulated partly by advances in experimental techniques, which have lead to the\nrealization of several different varieties of which\u2013path systems in the laboratory,3,4 and partly\nby accompanying developments in the theory of quantum measurement.5\u20137 However, it is\nthe realization that a which\u2013path experiment provides a very convenient model system for\ndeveloping and testing fundamental ideas about decoherence in mesoscopic systems,8,9 that\nhas increased the level of interest within the solid state physics community in particular.\nWhich\u2013path experiments in solid state systems were recently pioneered by Buks et al.3\nThe solid state analog of the two\u2013slit interference experiment is the measurement of the\noscillations in the current passing through an Aharonov\u2013Bohm (AB) ring as a function of\nthe applied magnetic field. The path taken by an electron may be probed by placing a\nmeasuring device close to one of the arms. Buks et al. incorporated a quantum dot in one\nof the arms in order to slow the electrons down, with a neighboring quantum point contact\n(QPC) serving as a which\u2013path detector. An electron travelling around the arm of the ring\ncontaining the dot dwells on the dot for a finite amount of time before moving on. The\npresence of the dot alone does not destroy the coherence of the electron transport through\nthe ring, so long as the dwell time of the electrons is sufficiently short,10 but it does provide\ntime for the electron to interact with an external measuring device. A QPC adjacent to\nthe dot functions as a measuring device since it can be biased so that its conductance is\nvery sensitive to changes in the occupancy of the dot: the passage of an electron via the\npath including the dot leaves behind which\u2013path information in the QPC device, although\nactual knowledge of which path an electron took, so\u2013called 'true which\u2013path information',\ncan only be obtained via further measurement.11 In accord with theoretical predictions,12\u201314\nthe experiment demonstrated that the interference fringes are degraded when the interaction\nbetween the electrons and the measuring device is sufficiently sensitive for information to be\nobtained that would help, even in principle, to determine which of the two possible paths\nan electron took.\nThe experiment of Buks et al. has close parallels with the well\u2013known thought experiment\n(see, e.g., Sec. 1-6 of Ref. 2), in which a light source is used to detect through which slit\nan electron passes in a two\u2013slit interference experiment. In both cases dephasing is effected\nby scatterers, each of which interact once, and once only, with the interfering particle and\nwhose interactions with each other may safely be ignored. For the electron\u2013light scattering\nscheme,2 the scatterers are photons which probe the electron's state directly, whereas in\nthe solid\u2013state experiment the scatterers are electrons in the QPC which interact with the\nelectron on the dot via electrostatic coupling. However, because the electron has a finite\ndwell time on the dot, it has time to interact with more than one scatterer in the QPC, so\nthat in this case dephasing can be achieved via a series of very weak interactions rather than\na single strong event, as is the case in the photon thought experiment.\nThe present work is concerned with a variation on the system considered by Buks et al.,\nin which a radio frequency mechanical cantilever is used, rather than a QPC, to determine\nwhich path an electron takes. A coupling between electrons residing on the dot (which is\n2\n\n\fagain on one of the AB interferometer arms) and the cantilever, whose tip is suspended over\nthe dot, can be set up by developing a uniform electric field between the tip of the cantilever\nand the base of the dot. Electrons on the dot couple approximately linearly to the cantilever\nposition, thus leading to a coupling between the flexural phonon modes of the cantilever and\nthe occupancy of the dot. Furthermore, because the coupling strength decays rapidly with\nincreasing frequency and also the flexural mode spectrum of a cantilever is quite sparse, it\nturns out that for micron scale cantilevers only the fundamental flexural mode is relevant.\nTherefore, at low temperatures the cantilever can be treated as a single quantum mechanical\noscillator.\nAs a consequence of the cantilever having effectively only one degree of freedom, the electromechanical which\u2013path interferometer exhibits qualitatively different behavior from the\nQPC which\u2013path device. In particular, we find that the dephasing behavior of the electron\ndue to the cantilever depends on the relative magnitudes of the electron dwell time on the dot\nand the cantilever period. When the dwell time is short compared to the cantilever period,\nthe dephasing occurs in a way analogous to Einstein's recoiling slit thought\u2013experiment.1,5\nIn contrast, when the dwell time of the electron on the dot is comparable to or longer than\nthe period of the cantilever, a description of the dephasing in terms of the entanglement of\nthe cantilever and electron states becomes more appropriate than a semiclassical picture of\nmomentum transfer. The effectively harmonic nature of the cantilever motion means that\nthe degree of entanglement between the cantilever and electronic states must be periodic,\nso long as the cantilever interacts only with the electron on the dot. If the dwell time of the\nelectrons on the dot could be tuned to the cantilever period, then we would be able to erase\nall which\u2013path information held in the state of the cantilever. This would give us direct\nevidence that the coupled cantilever and dot were behaving as a single coherent quantum\nsystem. However, in practice electron dwell times on a quantum dot have a distribution\nof values and so we can only obtain indirect evidence for the quantum coherence of the\ncantilever\u2013dot system, such as the coherent exchange of energy quanta between the electron\nand the cantilever which give rise to side resonances in the elastic transmission amplitude\nof the device.\nThe environment of the cantilever influences its behavior in two important ways: over\nshort timescales it destroys the cantilever's phase coherence, whilst over longer timescales it\ndamps the cantilever's motion. The electromechanical which\u2013path system we propose acts\nas a probe of the cantilever's decoherence due to it's interaction with the environment. We\nshow that the cantilever's decoherence inhibits the coherent exchange of energy between the\ncantilever and the dot and hence manifests itself by washing out the side resonances in the\nelastic transmission amplitude.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we give our basic model for the\nelectromechanical which\u2013path device and show that the interference properties of the AB\nring, modified to include the dot and cantilever, can be obtained by calculating the elastic\ntransmission amplitude of the arm containing the dot. In Sec. III we describe a simple tight\u2013\nbinding model for an electron on a dot which is linearly coupled to the cantilever (treated\nas a quantum oscillator) and to propagating states in the leads. We show that recent work\non inelastic resonant tunneling can be adapted to obtain the elastic transmission amplitude.\nWe present results for our model in Sec. IV, where we examine dephasing as a function\nof the dot\u2013cantilever coupling in both the regime where the electron dwell time is short\n3\n\n\fcompared to the cantilever period and where they are comparable.\nIn Sec. V we examine the influence of the cantilever's environment on the dephasing\nproduced by the cantilever when the dwell time is comparable to the period of the cantilever.\nWe obtain a modified expression for the transmission through the arm with the dot when\nthe cantilever is coupled to an environment which consists of a bath of oscillators.\nIn Sec. VI we outline the principal practical constraints on an electromechanical which\u2013\npath device and discuss its feasibility using currently available technology. We draw our\nconclusions in Sec. VII and discuss ways in which the present work could be extended.\nAppendix A contains a detailed, classical analysis of the cantilever\u2013dot coupling and the\nflexural mode spectrum of the cantilever which underpin the simplified model employed in\nthe main text. Finally, appendix B contains details of a general calculation of the effect of\nthe cantilever environment on the transmission amplitude of the dot.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\n\nThe ultimate goal of our analysis of the electromechanical which\u2013path device is to obtain\nan expression for how the magnetoresistance of the AB ring varies as a function of the\ncoupling between the cantilever and an electron on the dot. In particular, we want to\ndetermine how the amplitude and phase of the oscillation in the current through the device\nas the magnetic field is varied (i.e., the interference fringes) depend on the voltage between\nthe cantilever and the dot. In order to simplify the analysis, we will consider only the case\nwhere the magnetoresistance is measured as an average over a time much longer than any\nother timescale in the problem.\nOur model builds on the theoretical analysis of the QPC which\u2013path experiment, carried\nout by a number of groups.12\u201314 However, there are also close parallels between the system\nwe consider and a quantum optical system analyzed recently,15,16 in which radiation is used\nto drive an oscillator\u2013mounted mirror into non\u2013classical states.\nSince we are interested in the behavior of the system averaged over time, it is sufficient\nto work within the Landauer framework, so that our task of obtaining the average magnetoresistance is equivalent to calculating the transmission characteristics of the device.17 The\nsimplest way of thinking about the transmission probability through the AB ring is in terms\nof a two\u2013slit experiment: the total transmission probability, T , is given by the coherent sum\nof amplitudes for transmission through the left and right arms, tl and tr ,\nT = |tl + tr |2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThis approach was employed by Yacoby et al.10 in their analysis of the first experiments on\nAB rings with a quantum dot included in one arm. However, in that case this simple formalism proved inadequate as it neglects the contribution of electrons which have undergone\nmultiple reflections. The contribution to the transmission of multiply reflected electrons\nleads to the enforcement of the Onsager\u2013type relation for the conductance from source (S)\nto drain (D): GDS (B) = GDS (\u2212B), which must apply for a two\u2013terminal device.18\u201321 If the\nAB ring is modified to absorb electrons which are scattered backwards in the device, then\nthe Onsager\u2013type condition is no longer satisfied and the simple\u2013minded formula (1) is valid.\nBuks et al. incorporated just such a modification in their AB ring and we shall limit our\n4\n\n\fanalysis to this case. We write t\u0303QD for the transmission through the arm containing the dot\nand t0 for the other amplitude. The presence of a magnetic flux, \u03a6, induces an additional\nrelative phase shift between the two paths and so the transmission probability in the absence\nof the cantilever can be written as\nT = t0 + t\u0303QD ei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60\n\n2\n\nh\n\ni\n\n= T (0) + 2Re t\u22170 t\u0303QD ei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a60 is the flux quantum and T (0) is the flux independent term of the transmission\nprobability. In practice, the transmission through the arm with the dot is much less than\nthat through the arm without the dot, |t\u0303QD | \u226a |t0 |, and so T0 \u2248 |t0 |2 .\nWhen there is a non\u2013zero interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the\ndot, we must explicitly include the fact that the transmission depends on the initial state\nof the cantilever. Since the cantilever contains a macroscopic number of atoms we assume\nthat its initial state can always be described as a thermal mixture. Such a procedure will\nnecessarily lead us to neglect short time correlations between the cantilever states, but this\nwill be unimportant if the magnetoresistance is averaged over a time which is long compared\nwith the characteristic timescale for the thermalization of the cantilever's motion.22 With\nthe initial state of the cantilever assumed to be thermal we have,\nT =\n\nXX\ni\n\nf\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c1i hi|t0 + t\u0302QD ei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 |f i hi|t0 + t\u0302QD ei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 |f i\n\n\u0011\u2217 i\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere t\u0302QD is an operator on cantilever states only, \u03c1i is the usual thermal weight (\u03c1i =\nP\ne\u2212\u03b2\u01ebi / j e\u2212\u03b2\u01ebj , with \u03b2 = 1/kB T and \u01ebi the energy of the state), and we have made no\nassumption about the final state of the cantilever mode. Because only the dot arm interacts\nwith the cantilever the interference term is diagonal in the cantilever modes,\n2Re\n\n\"\nX\ni\n\n\u03c1i t\u22170 hi|t\u0302QD |iiei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60\n\n#\n\nh\n\ni\n\n= 2Re t\u22170 ht\u0303QD iei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ht\u0303QD i is averaged over the cantilever thermal state. Thus, only elastic scattering\nprocesses contribute to the interference term.\nAt finite temperatures we also have to average the transmission amplitude for transport\nthrough the arm containing the dot over the Fermi distribution:17\nht\u0303QD i =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u2202f\nd\u01eb \u2212\n\u2202\u01eb\n\n!\n\nhtQD (\u01eb)i.\n\n(5)\n\nThe knowledge of the transmission amplitude allows us to obtain the amplitude of the\nperiodic oscillations in the current, or in the language of a generic two\u2013slit experiment, the\nvisibility of the interference fringes. The visibility, v, in a two\u2013slit experiment is defined in\nterms of the maximum and minimum signal (in this case current), measured at the peaks\nand valleys of the fringes, respectively:23\nv=\n\nmax. \u2212 min.\n.\nmax. + min.\n\n(6)\n\nIn the case of the electromechanical which\u2013path device considered here, the current is\nproportional to the transmission probability, T , given in Eq. (3) above. We can write\n5\n\n\fthe transmission amplitudes through the two arms in modulus\u2013argument form, ht\u0303QD i =\n|ht\u0303QD i|ei\u03b1 and t\u22170 = |t0 |e\u2212i\u03b2 , so that the interference part of the transmission probability\ntakes the form\ni\n\nh\n\n2Re t\u22170 ht\u0303QD iei2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 = 2|t0 ||ht\u0303QD i| cos (2\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) .\n\n(7)\n\nHence in this case, the visibility of the fringes is\nv=\n\n2|t0 ||ht\u0303QD i|\n2|ht\u0303QD i|\n\u2243\n.\n(0)\nT\n|t0 |\n\n(8)\n\nThe phase of the transmission amplitude determines the phase of the fringe pattern as a\nfunction of the magnetic field. Any change in the phase of the transmission amplitude should\ntherefore be detectable as a change in the phase of the whole interference pattern.\nIn the absence of the dot, and for the ideal case of a ring in which both arms are identical,\nthe transmission amplitudes for both arms are the same so that T0 = 2|t0 |2 and the visibility\nis unity. This demonstrates the utility of v as a measure: it does not depend on the value\nof the total transmission probability through the device, but just on its interferometric\nproperties.\nIn practice, a fringe visibility close to unity cannot be achieved. Apart from the obvious\ndifficulty in constructing a ring in which both arms are identical, there are two further reasons\nwhy the 'intrinsic' visibility is less than unity.10 Firstly, there is more than one conduction\nchannel in each arm and so the transport is never really a 'one electron' problem. Secondly,\nthermal smearing can play an important r\u00f4le, since the thermal smearing length is typically\ncomparable to the size of the ring at temperatures of around 100mK.10 However, for our\ndevice the reduction in fringe visibility arising from sources other than the cantilever is\nirrelevant: all we require is that there should be a measurable change in the visibility of the\nfringes as the electric field coupling the dot and cantilever is turned on.\nIII. TRANSMISSION AMPLITUDE\n\nIn order to obtain the transmission amplitude for the arm of the AB ring containing\nthe dot, we employ a standard tight\u2013binding model for the dot and the leads to which\nit is coupled. In the Coulomb blockade regime, the quantum dot is modelled by a single\nlocalised state, at energy \u01eb0 , which is coupled to sets of non\u2013interacting, propagating, states\nin the leads. The cantilever is treated as a single quantum oscillator mode of frequency \u03c90 ,\nalthough the generalisation to include a spectrum of modes is straightforward, as we discuss\nbelow. The total Hamiltonian of the interferometer arm can be written as the sum of two\nparts\nH = H0 + H1 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith non\u2013interacting part\nH0 = \u01eb0 \u0109\u2020 \u0109 +\n\nX\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u01ebkL \u0109\u2020kL \u0109kL + \u01ebkR \u0109\u2020kR \u0109kR + h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2,\n\nk\n\nand interacting part\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fH1 = \u2212\u03bb\u0109\u2020 \u0109(\u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 ) +\n\nX\nk\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nVkL \u0109\u2020kL \u0109 + \u0109\u2020 \u0109kL +\n\nX\nk\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nVkR \u0109\u2020kR \u0109 + \u0109\u2020 \u0109kR ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u0109 and \u00e2 operate on the states of the electron on the dot and the cantilever, respectively.\nThe states in the left\u2013hand(right\u2013hand) leads have energies \u01ebkL (\u01ebkR ) and are operated on by\n\u0109kL (\u0109kR ), where the index k runs over propagating states in the leads. The matrix elements\nfor hopping onto(off) the dot are given by VkL (VkR ). The interaction between the electron on\nthe dot and the cantilever is modelled as a linear coupling between the displacement of the\nflexural mode and the occupation of the dot, since when the electron is not on the dot there\nis no displacement of the cantilever.24 We analyze the interaction between the cantilever and\nthe dot in some detail in appendix A, where the form of the interaction is derived in terms\nof the normal modesqof the cantilever. We find that the coupling constant, \u03bb, is given by\nthe relation \u03bb = \u03beeE h\u0304/2m\u03c90 [see Eq. (A12)], where \u03be is a geometrical factor of order one,\nE is the electric field experienced by the additional electron on the dot, m is the cantilever\nmass and e(> 0) the electronic charge.\nThe energy-dependent amplitude, tQD (\u01eb), is calculated using the usual S\u2013matrix\nformalism25 employed in transport theory. The amplitude for transmission from a state\nof energy \u01eb to one of energy \u01eb\u2032 is given by the element of the S\u2013matrix25 linking propagating\nstates in the left and right\u2013hand leads\nh\u01eb\u2032 , R|S|\u01eb, Li = tQD (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 ),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere h\u01eb\u2032 , R|(|\u01eb, Li) is the state in the right(left)\u2013hand lead with energy \u01eb\u2032 (\u01eb). The total\ntransmission amplitude at energy \u01eb is then obtained by integrating over the final state\nenergies\ntQD (\u01eb) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ntQD (\u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 )d\u01eb\u2032 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe S\u2013matrix element for a single electron tunneling from left to right through a single,\nlocalised, state which is coupled to a cantilever mode can be calculated using either the\nmethods described by Wingreen et al.25 or those of Glazman and Shekhter.26 For initial and\nfinal states of the cantilever given by \u03b1i and \u03b1f respectively, the relevant matrix element is\ndt1 dt2 \u2212\u03b7(|t1 |+|t2 |)\ne\nh\u03042\n\u00d7 h\u01eb\u2032 , \u03b1f , R|eiH0 t2 /h\u0304 H1 \u011cR (t2 \u2212 t1 )H1 e\u2212iH0 t1 /h\u0304 |\u01eb, \u03b1i , Li,\n\n\u2032\n\nh\u01eb , \u03b1f , R|S|\u01eb, \u03b1i , Li = \u2212 i\n\nZ Z\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u011cR (t) = \u2212i\u0398(t)e\u2212iHt/h\u0304 and \u03b7 is the usual small positive real number inserted to ensure\nconvergence.\nWe want to calculate the visibility of the fringes and so we need only calculate the\ncoherent part of the transmission probability, and hence the elastic transmission amplitude.\nTo evaluate the elastic transmission amplitude we consider processes in which the state of\nthe cantilever remains unchanged and so we write \u03b1i = \u03b1f = \u03b1 and calculate an average\nover an ensemble of states of the cantilever (see the discussion in Sec. II above). Thus\n\u2032\n\nhSi = \u2212VR (\u01eb)VL (\u01eb )\n\nZ Z\n\ndt1 dt2 \u2212\u03b7(|t1 |+|t2 |)\n\u2032\n\u00d7 ei(\u01eb t2 \u2212\u01ebt1 )/h\u0304 \u0398(t2 \u2212 t1 )h0, \u03b1|\u0109(t2 )\u0109\u2020 (t1 )|0, \u03b1i (15)\n2 e\nh\u0304\n7\n\n\fwith |VL(R) (\u01eb)|2 = k |VkL(R) |2 \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 \u01ebkL(kR) ) and where |0, \u03b1i is the state with no electrons\non the localised level and the cantilever in state \u03b1.\nWe assume that the coupling to the leads is independent of energy over the range of\ninterest and that it is symmetric so that we can write\nP\n\n\u0393 = \u0393L(R) = 2\u03c0|VL(R) |2 .\n\n(16)\n\nSince we are considering only the elastic part of the transmission amplitude the Green\nfunction will be invariant with respect to time. Hence, we change variables to \u03c4 = t2 \u2212 t1\nand t0 = t1 , so that the Green function takes the form\nGR (\u03c4, t0 ) = \u2212i\u0398(\u03c4 )h\u0109(\u03c4 + t0 )\u0109\u2020 (t0 )i\n\n(17)\n\nand the invariance with respect to translations in time is equivalent to the statement that\nthe value of the Green function is independent of the choice of t0 . Averaging over t0 , and\ntaking the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0+ , the overall expression for the S\u2013matrix element is then\n\u0393 Z \u221e d\u03c4 i\u01eb\u03c4 /h\u0304 R\nh\u01eb , R|S|\u01eb, Li = \u2212i\ne\nG (\u03c4 ) \u00d7 2\u03c0\u03b4(\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 ).\n2\u03c0 0 h\u0304\n\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nThus, the final expression for the transmission amplitude of the dot is\nhtQD (\u01eb)i = \u2212i\u0393\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nd\u03c4 i\u01eb\u03c4 /h\u0304 R\ne\nG (\u03c4 ),\nh\u0304\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the transmission amplitude is understood to be time\u2013averaged in the sense described\nin Sec. II, and the relevant Green function is\nGR (\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\u0398(\u03c4 )h\u0109(\u03c4 )\u0109\u2020 (0)i,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the expectation value is over a thermal distribution state of the cantilever with no\nelectrons present. This result for the transmission amplitude is very similar to that studied\nby Aleiner et al.,13 in their analysis of the QPC which\u2013path device.\nThe Green function can be evaluated using either operator algebra techniques,26 or many\nbody perturbation theory,25 and one obtains\n\u2212\u03c6(\u03c4 )\nGR (\u03c4 ) = GR\n,\n0 (\u03c4 )e\n\n(21)\n\n(\u2212i\u01eb0 \u2212\u0393/2)\u03c4 /h\u0304\nGR\n,\n0 (\u03c4 ) = \u2212i\u0398(\u03c4 )e\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\nand it has been assumed that the renormalisation of the dot energy, \u01eb0 , due to coupling to the\nleads can be ignored. The factor due to coupling to the cantilever, \u03c6(\u03c4 ), can be obtained by\ncalculating the contribution for the cantilever beginning and ending in a particular coherent\nstate, |\u03bdi, and then carrying out a thermal average over all coherent states with appropriate\nweightings,\n2 [\u03c9\n\ne\u2212\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = ei(\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 )\n\n0 \u03c4 \u2212sin(\u03c90 \u03c4 )]\n\n2 [1\u2212cos(\u03c9\n\ne\u2212(\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 )\n\n8\n\n0 \u03c4 )]\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03bd (\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 )(\u03bd \u2217 \u03bc\u2212\u03bd\u03bc\u2217 ) \u2212|\u03bd|2 /n\n,\ne\ne\n\u03c0n\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere \u03bc = ei\u03c90 t \u2212 1. Evaluating the thermal average, we find\n\u03bb\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) =\n\n!2\n\n{i[sin(\u03c90 \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c90 \u03c4 ] + [1 \u2212 cos(\u03c90 \u03c4 )](1 + 2n)} ,\n\n(24)\n\nwith n the thermal occupation of the cantilever mode.\nIt is clear that the thermal average leads to a much more rapidly decaying term, due to\nthe extra factor of 2n. If the cantilever remained in a coherent state throughout then it would\nbe far less effective, compared to the thermal state, at reducing the visibility of the fringes.\nThis is because each coherent state affects the transmission amplitude in two different ways:\nthe magnitude of the transmission is reduced by an amount which is independent of which\nstate the cantilever is in and also a phase shift is induced whose size depends sensitively\non the cantilever state. When we carry out the thermal average we are in effect averaging\nover a range of different phase shifts. Such a procedure effectively destroys the interference\nfringes whenever the thermal state includes contributions in which the phase differs by \u223c 2\u03c0,\nirrespective of the magnitude of the transmission amplitude for each of the coherent states\nwhich constitute the thermal mixture. The thermal averaging timescale is given by the\ndamping time of the cantilever which will typically be much larger than the dwell time\nof the electron on the dot. In this case, the loss of fringe visibility arising from thermal\nsmearing is not due to which\u2013path detection of individual electrons: a measurement of the\ncurrent averaged over times shorter than the damping time but longer than the dwell time\nwould resolve AB fringes with phase fluctuating in time. In contrast, the state-independent\nreduction in the transmission amplitude would give rise to a reduction in the fringe visibility\neven for the time-resolved measurement, signifying which\u2013path detection. However, since\nwe are working in a steady state regime in which we consider measurements made over very\nlong times we will not be able to make an explicit distinction between which\u2013path detection\nand thermal smearing in this work.\nWe can repeat this calculation for the more general case of coupling to a whole series\nof non-interacting cantilever modes. The result has the same basic structure as before, but\nthe cantilever factor, \u03c6(\u03c4 ), is modified and now takes the form of a sum of the contributions\nfrom each mode,25,26\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03bbi\nh\u0304\u03c9i\n\n!2\n\n[i(sin(\u03c9i \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c9i \u03c4 ) + (1 \u2212 cos(\u03c9i \u03c4 ))(1 + 2ni )] ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03bbi , \u03c9i , and ni are the coupling constant, frequency, and thermal occupation number\nof the ith cantilever mode, respectively. However, we find that for the purposes of demonstrating the electromechanical which\u2013path device we need only consider a single mode, as\nis discussed in appendix A.\nIV. RESULTS FOR ISOLATED CANTILEVER\n\nThe important question which we need to answer is the following: When does the cantilever destroy the AB fringes? There are two very different regimes which we can explore\nby varying the relative sizes of characteristic dwell time of the electron on the dot, \u03c4d = h\u0304/\u0393,\nand the fundamental frequency of the cantilever:\n9\n\n\f1. \u03c90 \u03c4d \u226a 1: in this case the periodic behavior of the cantilever will not be relevant and\nthe entanglement built up between the cantilever and electron states during the dwell\ntime will be irreversible, leading to dephasing.\n2. \u03c90 \u03c4d \u223c 1: in this regime the periodicity of the cantilever means that the entanglement\nof the cantilever and dot states caused by their interaction may be partially undone, or\nerased, although the distribution of electron dwell times will make the effect impossible\nto observe directly.\nThe first regime is easier to analyze theoretically, as the calculations can be done analytically and invite direct comparisons with the sliding\u2013slit thought experiment. The case\nwhere the dwell time of the electron on the dot is comparable to the period of the cantilever\nhas to be analyzed numerically. It is also complicated by the presence of the cantilever's\nenvironment which makes the entanglement of the cantilever and dot states irreversible by\nbreaking the overall periodicity in the expression (19) for the transmission amplitude. In\nthis section, we calculate the magnitude and phase of the transmission amplitude in both\nregimes, neglecting the effect of the environment which we address in detail in Sec. V. This\napproach enables a clear picture to be built up of exactly how the environment affects the\nbehavior of the cantilever\u2013dot system.\nA. Regime Where \u03c90 \u03c4d \u226a 1\n\nSince \u03c90 \u03c4d \u226a 1, we can simplify Eq. (19) for the transmission amplitude through the arm\nwith the dot by expanding the harmonic functions to quadratic order in \u03c90 \u03c4d . We obtain\nhtQD (\u01eb)i \u2243 \u2212\u0393\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c4 [i(\u01eb\u2212\u01eb0 )\u2212\u0393/2]\u03c4 /h\u0304\u2212(eE\u2206xth \u03c4 )2 /2h\u03042\ne\n,\nh\u0304\n\n(26)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u2206xth = (2n + 1)(h\u0304/2m\u03c90 ) is the thermal position uncertainty of the cantilever\nand we have taken the geometrical factor in the coupling constant (A12) to be unity for\nsimplicity. The integral on the righthand side can now be evaluated to obtain\n\u03c0\nhtQD (\u01eb)i \u2243 \u2212\n2\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393\n[\u0393/2 \u2212 i(\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 )]2\n\u0393/2 \u2212 i(\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 )\n\u221a\nexp\nErfc\n.\neE\u2206xth\n2(eE\u2206xth )2\n2eE\u2206xth\n!\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\n(27)\n\nIf we ignore, for the moment, the thermal width of the electron energy distribution in\nthe leads, then we can deduce from this expression a rough criterion for dephasing in the\nregion close to the electronic resonance:\neE\u2206xth > \u0393,\n\n(28)\n\nh\u0304\n.\n\u2206xth\n\n(29)\n\nor written in another way,\neE\u03c4d >\n\nPractical considerations (see Sec. VI) restrict the dwell time to be a few ns or less and place\nan upper bound on the electric field: E \u223c 105 V/m. Thus, the destruction of the interference\nfringes requires \u2206xth > 10\u22122 \u00c5, a value which is certainly achievable.\n10\n\n\fAs previously discussed, the loss of fringe visibility is not only associated with which\u2013path\ndetection, but with thermal smearing as well. We can obtain the condition for which\u2013path\ndetection by setting the cantilever temperature to zero in Eq. (29):\neE\u03c4d >\n\nh\u0304\n= 2\u2206pzp ,\n\u2206xzp\n\n(30)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u2206xzp = h\u0304/2m\u03c90 denotes the zero-point position uncertainty. Because the reduction\nin the transmission amplitude due to each different coherent state is the same [c.f., Eq. (23)],\nthis condition holds independently of which coherent state the cantilever is in. Thus, we find\nthat for which\u2013path detection to occur the classical impulse delivered to the cantilever during\nthe dwell time must exceed twice the zero\u2013point momentum uncertainty of the cantilever.\nOur result is equivalent to that obtained by Bohr in his famous discussion of Einstein's\nsliding\u2013slit gedanken experiment.1 In that case Bohr argued that in order to detect the\npassage of an electron through a given slit, the momentum uncertainty in the slit must be\nless than the impulse transferred by the passing electron, thus necessitating a corresponding\nlatitude in position of the slits (via the uncertainty principle) which in turn washes out the\nfringes by causing large phase shifts (i.e., \u223c 2\u03c0) for successive electrons. However, these\nphase shifts are not associated with any kind of thermal fluctuation, instead they arise from\nthe position uncertainty of the quantum state of the slits.\nAt finite temperatures we must take into account not only the thermal state of the\ncantilever, but also the fact that the electron energies are spread over a range \u223c 4kB T\naround the Fermi energy. We must therefore average the transmission amplitude over energy,\nweighted by the derivative of the Fermi distribution function [see Eq. (5)]:\nht\u0303QD i =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nhtQD (\u01eb)i\n\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0\nd\u01eb\n,\nsech2\n4kB T\n2kB T\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(31)\n\nwhere we have assumed that the bias across the device is small enough for a linear response\napproach to be valid and that the average Fermi energy in the leads is tuned to the resonance\n\u01eb0 . The effect of this procedure is to reduce both the coherent transmission amplitude itself\nand the influence the cantilever has on it. The explanation for this unexpected feature\ncan be found by comparing the transmission amplitude, htQD (\u01eb)i, at and away from the\nresonance. Whilst the transmission amplitude at, or close to, resonance decays rapidly with\nincreasing coupling to the cantilever, the situation is reversed when the electron energy is\nfar from resonance, where the transmission amplitude is enhanced by the interaction with\nthe cantilever. The reduction in dephasing efficiency due to the thermal averaging over\nthe electron energy distribution makes an interesting contrast to the effect of the thermal\naverage over cantilever states, which increases the dephasing rate substantially.\nFig. 1 illustrates the effect of increasing the dimensionless coupling constant \u03ba = \u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90\non the magnitude of the resonant transmission amplitude |htQD (\u01eb0 )i|, with and without\naveraging over the thermal width of the electron energy distribution in the leads. For this\nexample, we have taken \u03c90 = 140 MHz and T =20 mK (giving a thermal occupation n = 18),\nm = 8 \u00d7 10\u221220 kg, and assumed \u03ba to have a maximum value of about 3, consistent with the\nanalysis of the cantilever\u2013dot coupling in appendix A. The effect of the thermal broadening\nof electron energies in reducing the efficiency of the cantilever to cause dephasing is clear.\n11\n\n\fIt is important to note that our treatment is entirely restricted to a one\u2013electron picture\nof transport. Such an approach is valid so long as the electron gas in the leads and the dot\nitself is non-degenerate. When the electron temperature drops towards zero the interactions\nbetween electrons can no longer be ignored and so our model and the results which follow\nfrom it become inapplicable. At T = 0 and in the weak bias limit, inelastic transport\nthrough the dot would become impossible: with the absence of unoccupied states below the\nFermi level and the cantilever in the ground state an electron is unable to exchange energy\nquanta with the cantilever.\nB. Regime Where \u03c90 \u03c4d \u223c 1\n\nIn the regime where the dwell time of the electron on the dot approaches the period of\nthe cantilever, the system takes on a rather different character, as the dephasing interaction\nbetween the cantilever and the electron on the dot is no longer a brief scattering event,\nbut a sustained interaction. In this regime we would expect to see evidence of the periodic\nbehavior of the cantilever, such as side resonances in the elastic transmission amplitude, but\nin practice these would have to compete with thermal effects which tend to wash out fine\nstructure in the transmission characteristics.\nIn order to calculate the transmission amplitude, it is convenient to recast our earlier\nexpression (19) in the form\n2\n\n\u0393\ne\u2212(\u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 ) (2n+1)\nhtQD (\u01eb)i = \u2212\nh\u0304\u03c90 1 \u2212 e\u2212(2\u03c0/\u03c90 )[i(\u01eb0 \u2212(\u03bb2 /h\u0304\u03c90 )\u2212\u01eb)/h\u0304)+\u0393/2h\u0304]\n(\n\"\n!\n#\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u03bb2\n\u0393\n\u2212\u03c4 \u2032 i\n\u2032\n\u00d7\nd\u03c4 exp\n\u01eb0 \u2212\n\u2212\u01eb +\n\u03c90 h\u0304\nh\u0304\u03c90\n2h\u0304\n0\n\u03bb\n\u2212i\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\n!2\n\n\u03bb\nsin(\u03c4 ) + (2n + 1)\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\u2032\n\n!2\n\n\u2032\n\n)\n\ncos(\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2032 = \u03c90 \u03c4 . Of course, to model a practical experiment, we also need to average over\nthe energy, \u01eb, to take into account the effect of electron temperature. However, we look\nfirst at the dependence of the transmission amplitude on the incident energy. Although this\nwould require 'monochromatic' electrons, important insight is gained into the behavior of\nthe system which in practice may be obscured by thermal effects.\nIn Fig. 2, the magnitude of the resonant transmission amplitude is plotted against the\ncoupling \u03ba for \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 =2, 1, and 0.5, and with n = 18. The behavior is similar in all three\ncases for small \u03ba, with a rapid decay in the magnitude of the transmission amplitude, due to\ndephasing caused by a combination of which\u2013path detection and thermal fluctuations in the\nstate of the cantilever. Notice, however, that for \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 =1, oscillations eventually develop\nin the transmission, and that these become even more pronounced for \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 =0.5.\nIn order to clarify the origin of the oscillations in |htQD (\u01eb)i|, Fig. 3 plots the evolution\nof the amplitude and phase of the transmission amplitude as functions of both the coupling\nconstant, \u03ba, and the detuning energy \u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 , for \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 = 0.5 and n = 18. It is now clear that\nthere are side resonances at \u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 + \u03bb2 /h\u0304\u03c90 = \u00b1h\u0304\u03c90 , \u00b12h\u0304\u03c90 , ..., and that these resonances\ndrift in energy as the value of \u03ba is increased.25,27 It is this drift which is responsible for the\noscillations in |htQD (\u01eb)i| as a function of the coupling, \u03ba, for given fixed \u01eb.\n12\n\n\fNote that if the cantilever temperature is set equal to zero, i.e., it is in its ground state,\nn = 0, then side resonances are still observed, but only on one side of the main peak, at\n\u01eb \u2212 \u01eb0 + \u03bb2/h\u0304\u03c90 = +h\u0304\u03c90 , +2h\u0304\u03c90 , ....This is because in its ground state the cantilever can only\nabsorb energy quanta.\nUnder the conditions kB T \u226b h\u0304\u03c90 , \u03ba \u223c 1, and near resonance, Eq. (32) has the following\nasymptotic approximation:\n\u0393\nhtQD (\u01eb)i \u223c \u2212\n2\u03bb\n\ns\n\n\u03c0h\u0304\u03c90\nkB T\n\n(\n\n2\n\n1 + e\u2212(2\u03c0/h\u0304\u03c90 )[i(\u01eb0 \u2212\u03bb /h\u0304\u03c90 \u2212\u01eb)+\u0393/2h\u0304]\n.\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(2\u03c0/h\u0304\u03c90 )[i(\u01eb0 \u2212\u03bb2 /h\u0304\u03c90 \u2212\u01eb)+\u0393/2h\u0304]\n)\n\n(33)\n\nThe various above-discussed features in the transmission amplitude dependence on coupling\nand energy can be clearly seen in this simplifying approximation.\nSide resonances are a familiar feature in tunneling problems, but unlike those found here\nthey are usually associated with inelastic processes. However, as was first shown by Jauho\nand Wingreen,27 who considered the classical\u2013oscillator version of the problem we address,\nsuch resonances can also occur in the elastic transmission amplitude. Side resonances in\nthe elastic transmission indicate coherent or virtual exchange of energy quanta between the\nelectron on the dot and the cantilever, with no net energy interchange over the dwell time of\nthe electron. In a fully quantum mechanical system, these processes must rely on the coupled\ncantilever\u2013electron system maintaining its phase coherency and so we may expect that the\ninfluence on the cantilever of its environment should be detectable, at least in principle, via\nits effect on these resonances.\nThe side resonances have a separation in energy of h\u0304\u03c90 , but for any practically realizable\nsystem the thermal energy scale will be much larger, as we discuss in detail in Sec. VI.\nHowever, in the regime where h\u0304\u03c90 \u226a kB T , averaging over the thermal distribution of electron\nenergies will wash out the side resonances. This means that it would not be possible to find\nany trace of the coherent exchange of energy quanta between the cantilever and the electron\non the dot in the transmission characteristics. Only if the electron energy width could be\nlowered or the frequency raised to the point where h\u0304\u03c90 \u223c kB T would we then expect such\nfeatures to be visible. Note, in the case of photon assisted tunneling the photon energy can\nbe made comparable with kB T without difficulty.27\nV. INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON CANTILEVER\n\nThus far, we have treated the cantilever\u2013dot system as isolated, thereby ignoring the\neffect of the environment on their degrees of freedom. This approximation is valid when\nthe dwell time of the electron on the dot is short compared to the decoherence time of the\ncantilever, as will most certainly be the case for \u03c90 \u03c4d \u226a 1. However, there is no reason\nto assume that this will also be the case when \u03c90 \u03c4d \u223c 1. Indeed, we would like to know\nhow the environment of the cantilever affects the coherent oscillations which occur in the\ntransmission amplitude as a function of the coupling strength (for monochromatic electrons).\nIntuitively, we expect that the decoherence arising from the cantilever's environment should\nwash out the side resonances in the transmission amplitude, but a detailed calculation is\nrequired to determine the cantilever quality (Q) factor range for this to occur.\nIn general, both the interaction between the dot electron and its local environment\n(other electrons, phonons, photons, etc. in the dot region) and the interaction between the\n13\n\n\fcantilever and its environment (the other collective vibrational modes, as well as internal\nelectronic degrees of freedom, external photons, gas molecules, etc.) will contribute to the\ndecoherence. However, since we can always measure the properties of the fringes with the\ndot\u2013cantilever interaction turned off for an arbitrary dwell time (\u03c4d = h\u0304/\u0393), we need only\nconsider the additional effect of the cantilever's environment, as the electron's environment\ncan be included via a renormalisation of the zero electric field transmission amplitude.\nA. Estimate of Cantilever Decoherence Time\n\nWe can obtain a rough estimate of the time\u2013scale over which superpositions of cantilever\nstates, resulting from the coupling to the dot electron, are likely to be decohered by the\nenvironment by using a simple, heuristic approach which models the environment as an\ninfinite set of harmonic oscillators.28,16 This approach leads to the prediction that for a\nsystem with a classical damping rate, \u03b3c , a linear superposition of two different coherent\nstates whose centers are a distance\n\u2206x apart, where \u2206x is greater than the thermal de\n\u221a\nBroglie wavelength, \u03bbth = h\u0304/ 2mkB T , will decohere at a rate \u03b3d , given by\n\u03b3d \u223c\n\n2m\u03b3c kB T (\u2206x)2\n.\nh\u03042\n\n(34)\n\nHowever, we cannot apply this heuristic rule directly to the coupled cantilever\u2013dot system\nas the displacement of the cantilever is a continuously varying function. An estimate for\nthe decoherence rate of the cantilever can only be obtained using this method if the further\napproximation of averaging over the cantilever displacement is made.16 If the cantilever\nstarts in any given coherent state when the electron arrives on the dot, then the state of\nthe cantilever at time t later will be a different coherent state centered a distance \u2206x apart\nfrom the point on which the initial state was centred, where\n\u2206x(t) =\n\ns\n\n2h\u0304\n\u03ba[1 \u2212 cos(\u03c90 t)].\nm\u03c90\n\n(35)\n\nThus we can obtain an estimate for the decoherence rate \u03b3d of the cantilever due to its\nenvironment for the case where \u03c4d \u03c90 = 1 by averaging this displacement over the cantilever\nperiod:16\n\u03b3d \u223c\n\n1\n4\u03ba2 \u03b3c kB T\n(2\u03c0/\u03c90 ) h\u0304\u03c90\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0/\u03c90\n0\n\ndt[1 \u2212 cos(\u03c90 t)]2 = 6\u03ba2 \u03b3c\n\nkB T\n.\nh\u0304\u03c90\n\n(36)\n\nFor a nanotube cantilever of frequency \u223c 140MHz (see appendix A), the Q\u2013factor29 can be\nof order 500 and so the classical damping rate, \u03b3c , will be of order 3 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 . Thus, at\na temperature of 20 mK, our heuristic expression for the decoherence rate of the nanotube\ncantilever gives 1/\u03b3d \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 s for \u03ba \u2243 3. This result signals that the decoherence of\nthe cantilever due to its environment has an effect whenever the dwell time approaches a\nmagnitude of order 1ns.\nWhilst the heuristic model we have outlined is very useful for estimating whether or not\nthe cantilever's environment is relevant for the calculation of the transmission amplitude,\nit is not expected to be very accurate, as it is an approximation even of the rule\u2013of\u2013thumb\n14\n\n\fgiven by Eq. (34). In order to improve on this estimate, we must enlarge our simple model\nby adding to the system Hamiltonian (9) the cantilever's environment, modelled as an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators with linear coupling to the cantilever. Modelling the\nenvironment in this way is of course itself a fairly serious approximation. However, this\napproximation is ubiquitous in one form or another throughout the theory of open quantum\nsystems.30,28,31,32 By extending our calculation to include this model of the cantilever's environment, we can obtain predictions for how the transmission properties of our which\u2013path\ndevice depend on the decoherence rate of the cantilever. Thus, we can use our theory to\npredict how changing the Q\u2013factor of the cantilever affects the interference fringes.\nB. Transport Properties with Environmental Coupling\n\nThe standard model of the environment which we use is an infinite bath of harmonic\noscillators which interact linearly with the cantilever, but do not interact with each other.\nWe have to assume an infinite bath of oscillators in order to have a reservoir which remains\nin thermal equilibrium despite contact with the cantilever. The infinite oscillator\u2013bath\nmodel of the environment is also equivalent to a quantum Langevin formalism in which the\ncantilever operators have an equation of motion containing a damping term and a thermal\nnoise operator arising from the reservoir.\nWe begin by considering just the interaction between the cantilever and its environment,\nbefore going on to include the effect of an electron on the dot and hence obtaining the\ntransmission amplitude including the environment. The cantilever-environment Hamiltonian\ncan be written as33,34\nHc = h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 +\n\nX\n\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u00c2\u2020(\u03c9)\u00c2(\u03c9) +\n\n\u03c9\n\nX\n\n[g(\u03c9)\u00e2\u2020\u00c2(\u03c9) + g \u2217 (\u03c9)\u00c2\u2020(\u03c9)\u00e2],\n\n(37)\n\n\u03c9\n\nwhere the cantilever states are again operated on by \u00e2, the bath oscillator of frequency\n\u03c9 is operated on by \u00c2(\u03c9) and the coupling constants g(\u03c9) depend on the bath oscillator\nfrequency.\nUsing the Hamiltonian Hc , the equation of motion for \u00e2 in the interaction picture is\nreadily obtained,33\n \u0307\n\u00e2(t)\n= (\u2212i\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b3)\u00e2(t) \u2212 F\u0302 (t),\n\n(38)\n\ng(\u03c9)\u00c2(\u03c9, 0)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\nF\u0302 (t) = i\n\nX\n\u03c9\n\nand the damping coefficient, \u03b3, is given by\n\u03b3 = \u03c0\u03b7b (\u03c90 )|g(\u03c90)|2 ,\n\n(40)\n\nwhere \u03b7b (\u03c9)\u03b4\u03c9 is the number of bath oscillators in the spectral range \u03b4\u03c9. The coefficient \u03b3\nprovides the bridge between the model and experiment, as it is simply related to the rate\nat which the system loses energy after being excited (i.e., the classical damping rate),34\n\u03b3c = 2\u03b3.\n15\n\n\fIntegration of the equation of motion for \u00e2(t), and a similar one for \u00e2\u2020 (t), leads to explicit\nexpressions for \u00e2(t) and \u00e2\u2020 (t):\n(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\n\u00e2(t) = \u00e2(0)e\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\n(i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\n\u00e2 (t) = \u00e2 (0)e\n\n(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\n\u2212e\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\n\n(i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\n\u2212e\n\nZ\n\nt\n0\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 F\u0302 (t\u2032 )e(i\u03c90 +\u03b3)t ,\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 F\u0302 \u2020 (t\u2032 )e(\u2212i\u03c90 +\u03b3)t .\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\nThe time t = 0 holds a special place in the theory since it is the time at which the\ninteractions between the cantilever and the bath are turned on and so the cantilever and the\nbath are apparently quite independent at this instant. However, this need not be the case\nand certainly would not be appropriate for the system we are considering. In order to specify\nthe model completely we need to give the expectation values at t = 0 for both the cantilever\nand the bath. If we set the initial expectation values of the cantilever to be those of a\nthermal state at the same temperature as the bath, then we can describe the case in which\nthe cantilever has been interacting with the bath for a time much longer than the damping\ntime, 1/\u03b3c , before t = 0 and so is in equilibrium with the bath. Our only assumption is that\nquantum correlations between the cantilever and the bath can be neglected at t = 0, the\nusual assumption made in calculating decoherence rates.\nThe expectation values are over products of cantilever and environment states. We\neventually want to calculate the transmission amplitude for an electron interacting with\na cantilever which is initially in a thermal state and so we choose to define the t = 0\nexpectation values as:\nc\n\nTr[...e\u2212H0 /kB T ]\nh...i =\n,\nc\nTr[e\u2212H0 /kB T ]\n\n(43)\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian without interactions is\nH0c = h\u0304\u03c90 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 +\n\nX\n\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u00c2\u2020 (\u03c9)\u00c2(\u03c9),\n\n(44)\n\n\u03c9\n\nand T defines the fixed temperature of the environment. Using this definition we find\nh\u00c2(\u03c9, 0)i = 0\nh\u00c2(\u03c9, 0)\u00c2(\u03c9 \u2032 , 0)i = 0\nh\u00c2\u2020 (\u03c9, 0)\u00c2(\u03c9 \u2032 , 0)i = \u03b4\u03c9\u03c9\u2032 N(\u03c9),\n\n(45)\n\nwith\nN(\u03c9) =\n\n1\neh\u0304\u03c9/kB T \u2212 1\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\nFor the cantilever itself the values of the zero-time correlation functions represent the initial conditions of the problem.

Therefore we can choose our origin of time, and hence the\ndefinition of the initial cantilever state, to be the time when the electron jumps onto the dot.\nThere is no need to explicitly include the interaction with the bath before the electron hops\nonto the dot as it is already implicitly included by assuming the cantilever is in a thermal\nstate at temperature T . However, when the electron is on the dot it drives the cantilever\naway from equilibrium and we now need to include the interaction with the environment\nexplicitly to model the behavior of the cantilever\u2013dot system as accurately as possible.\nWe obtain the transmission amplitude for the dot, including the effect of the cantilever's\nenvironment by applying the S\u2013matrix we used in Sec. III to a generalization of the Hamiltonian (9) which includes the coupling of the cantilever to the bath of oscillators,\nH = \u01eb0 \u0109\u2020 \u0109 + Hc + H1 +\n\nX\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u01ebkL \u0109\u2020kL \u0109kL + \u01ebkR \u0109\u2020kR \u0109kR ,\n\nk\n\n(49)\n\nwhere H1 , given by eqn (11), describes the electron\u2013cantilever coupling and the cantilever\u2013\nenvironment part, Hc , is given by Eq. (37).\nUsing the methods of Glazman and Shekhter,26 we can again separate out the electronic\npart of the transmission amplitude from the average over cantilever states, and so we find\nZ\n\nhtQD (\u01eb)i = \u2212\u0393\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nRt\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndt [i(\u01eb\u2212\u01eb0 )\u2212\u0393/2]t/h\u0304\ne\nhTt e\u2212i 0 WI (t )dt /h\u0304 i.\nh\u0304\n\n(50)\n\nThe term in angled brackets on the right\u2013hand side is known as the influence functional, Tt\nis the time ordering operator, and WI (t) is the electron\u2013cantilever coupling defined in the\ninteraction picture\nc t/h\u0304\n\nWI (t) = \u2212eiH\n\nc t/h\u0304\n\n\u03bb(\u00e2\u2020 + \u00e2)e\u2212iH\n\n= \u2212\u03bb[\u00e2\u2020 (t) + \u00e2(t)],\n\n(51)\n\nwhere \u00e2(t) and \u00e2\u2020 (t) are given by Eqs.

(33), merely by the replacement of \u0393/2h\u0304\nwith \u0393/2h\u0304 + (\u03ba2 \u03b3c kB T /h\u0304\u03c90 ). Thus, a decoherence rate \u03b3d can be identified as the term\n\u03ba2 \u03b3c kB T /h\u0304\u03c90 , which agrees with the earlier-derived estimate (36) up to an overall numerical factor. Approximation (62) clearly shows the washing out of the coherent, oscillatory\nbehavior by the environment when the decoherence time 1/\u03b3d is shorter than the cantilever\nperiod. When the decoherence time exceeds the dwell time h\u0304/\u0393, then the former has a\nnegligible effect on the transmission properties.\nC. Results for Cantilever Coupled to Environment\n\nThe expression for the transmission amplitude including the coupling to the cantilever's\nenvironment [Eq. (59)] can be integrated numerically, thereby allowing us to explore the\neffect on the transmission characteristics of varying the cantilever's Q\u2013factor under more\ngeneral conditions than those for which approximation (62) is justified. Fig. 4 shows the\nmagnitude and phase of the transmission amplitude through the dot for \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 = 0.5, n = 18\nand Q = \u03c90 /\u03b3c = 50. The diagram should be compared with Fig. 3 showing the behavior of\nthe same system without environmental coupling. Fig. 5 shows the behavior at resonance of\n|htQD (\u01eb)i| for Q = 50 and 500, as well as the \u03b3c /\u03c90 = 0 (no environment) case for comparison.\nIt is clear from the figures that the coupling to the environment tends to destroy the side\nresonances in the transmission amplitude, as well as the associated features in the phase.\nThis is because the environment acts to degrade the coherent superposition of cantilever\nstates into which the interaction with the electron tries to drive the cantilever. Furthermore,\nthe figures show that these environmental effects become increasingly important as the\ncantilever\u2013electron coupling, \u03ba, is increased. This is because the larger \u03ba is, the greater is\nthe difference between the states in the superposition into which the cantilever is driven,\nand consequently the faster is the rate at which the superposition decoheres.\nVI. PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe model parameter ranges actually allowed in an experiment are limited by practical\nconstraints. Up until now we have only referred to these very loosely and have concentrated instead on the range of behavior which can occur in the which\u2013path system under\nfundamental constraints alone.\nProbably the most important practical constraint affects the upper range of the electric\nfield which can be developed between the cantilever and the dot. The maximum allowable\nfield is typically \u223c 105 V/m before breakdown of the two\u2013dimensional electron gas occurs\ndue to deconfinement,35 and so we must take this as the largest possible value in considering\nthe practicality of the system.\nThe temperature of the system is limited by the difficulty of cooling conduction electrons\nto ultralow temperatures. It becomes extremely difficult to reduce the electron temperature below about 20 mK, because the electrons become practically decoupled from acoustic\nphonons. Therefore we take 20 mK to be the temperature minimum.\n\n19\n\n\fThe frequency range of the cantilever is crucial for observing quantum coherent behavior\nsuch as side resonances, as well as their destruction due to decoherence. The lower limit on\nthe frequency range is set by the requirement that the cantilever period should be comparable\nto the dwell time \u03c4d = h\u0304/\u0393 of the electron on the quantum dot, while the upper limit is\nset by the requirement that the interaction between the cantilever and the electron on the\ndot be sufficiently strong, given the limits on the electric field, to lead to decoherence, again\non a time\u2013scale comparable to the dwell time. The interaction between the electron on the\ndot and the cantilever is discussed in more detail in appendix A, along with the geometrical\nfactors which arise in the calculation of the effect of the electric field on the flexural cantilever\nmodes. The dwell time is limited by the rate at which processes other than the interaction\nwith the cantilever cause decoherence, as well as how small a current can be measured\nthrough the dot. Of course, the decoherence rate of all the background processes is very\ndifficult to estimate theoretically; in experiment it can be done by observing the visibility of\nthe fringes as a function of dwell time with the cantilever interaction switched off. This then\nprovides a baseline with which to compare all later measurements where we are interested\nin the effect of the cantilever. Previous experiments carried out at T = 0.1 K by Yacoby\net al.,10 which were designed to measure the phase of the transmission amplitude through a\ndot in the absence of any external probe, show that dwell times as long 10 ns and currents\nas low as \u223c 10\u221211 A lead to fringes which are still detectable.\nIt turns out that the best compromise between the two competing frequency limits is\nachieved by using say a carbon nanotube cantilever with a frequency of 100\u2013200 MHz, giving\na maximum coupling \u03ba = \u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 \u223c 3 (appendix A). The problem is not so much in finding\na cantilever with a high enough frequency, but rather in obtaining a large enough coupling\nfrom the electric field to cause a detectable amount of dephasing.\nIn the light of these practical constraints it is clear that only some of the theoretical results\nobtained in our analysis would be observable in an experiment using current technology. The\noverall destruction of the AB interference fringes as the coupling between the cantilever and\nthe electron on the dot is increased should be detectable, both in the regime where \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 \u226b\n1 and \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 \u223c 1. However, the restrictions on the temperature and cantilever frequency\nimply that an experiment would have to be performed in the regime where kB T \u226b h\u0304\u03c90 . This\nmeans that the thermal width of electron energies will wash out the side resonances in the\ntransmission which were found to occur when \u0393/h\u0304\u03c90 \u223c 1. Under these circumstances, the\neffect of the cantilever's environment on the transmission characteristics would be obscured.\nHowever, we emphasise again that these limitations are not fundamental: if the width of the\nelectron energies could be reduced or if the restriction on the maximum cantilever frequency\ncould be relaxed (by finding a way to increase the coupling between the electron on the\ndot and the cantilever, for example) then the coherent, quantum electromechanical features\nwhich our analysis predicts should be observable. Whilst it is not clear how the coupling\nconstant between the cantilever and the dot could be increased, it is possible to reduce the\nthermal width of electron energies by using a double quantum dot system rather than a\nsingle one as we have considered here.36\nIt is also possible to conduct experiments in which an ac bias is applied to the AB\nring. Such an experiment would provide an alternative way of investigating the interaction\nbetween the cantilever and its environment: if the ac frequency is higher than the rate \u03b3c at\nwhich the cantilever state changes due to thermal fluctuations then the thermally-induced\n20\n\n\ffluctuations in the phase of the interference fringes should be detectable, and distinguishable\nfrom the destruction of the interference fringes due to which-path detection. However, a\ndetailed analysis of such an experiment requires extending the theory developed here to\ninclude time dependence, and so goes well beyond the present analysis.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have carried out a theoretical analysis of a possible solid state which\u2013path interferometer, in which electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom become coupled. The visibility\nand phase of the interference fringes in the system depend strongly on the coupling between\nthe electron on the dot and the cantilever. The reduction in visibility with increasing coupling is due in part to the cantilever measuring the path taken by the electron and also due\nto thermal fluctuations in the state of the cantilever.\nWhen the dwell time of the electron on the dot is short compared to the period of the\ncantilever, the system behaves in a way which is analogous to Einstein's celebrated recoiling\nslit experiment. In contrast, when the dwell time is comparable to the cantilever's period,\nthe cantilever and the electron on the dot show signs of behaving as a single coherent\nquantum system, so long as the electrons incident on the dot have a sufficiently narrow\nenergy width. The coherency of the cantilever\u2013dot system is inferred from the appearance\nof side resonances in the transmission characteristics. Including the cantilever's environment\nin the analysis, we find that the side resonances are washed out for small enough oscillator\nQ\u2013factor, while the average decrease in the fringe visibility with increasing coupling to the\ncantilever is not affected.\nThe basic feature of the reduction of fringe visibility as a function of the coupling between the electron on the dot and the cantilever should be observable in an experiment using\ncurrently available technology. However, the more delicate features such as the side resonances in the transmission amplitude for long dwell times and the effect of the cantilever's\nenvironment on these resonances will usually be obscured by the energy thermal width of\nelectrons incident on the dot.\nThere are two important ways in which our analysis could be extended. Most straightforwardly, we could examine what effect using a double dot, rather than a single one, would\nhave on the behavior of the system. In particular, it would be interesting to see to what\nextent the electron energy width could be reduced, whilst maintaing an overall, measurable\ncurrent through the device. The second way our analysis could be extended would be to\ngo beyond our steady state treatment to obtain the time dependence of the transmission\namplitude. A time dependent analysis would allow us to make predictions about the way in\nwhich the thermal fluctuations in the state of the cantilever cause fluctuations in the phase\nof the interference fringes. Such fluctuations may prove to be observable in ac experiments\nand may also provide us with another way of inferring information about how the cantilever\ninteracts with its environment.\n\n21\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nM.P.B. would especially like to thank Eyal Buks for many helpful conversations and\ninvaluable suggestions.

These requirements can be satisfied conveniently by using a\ncarbon nanotube as a cantilever, rather than a device which has been fabricated via some\nkind of etching process from a much larger substrate.\nCarbon nanotubes have a number of remarkable physical properties which are beginning\nto exploited for practical purposes. Recent experiments have seen them employed as hyper\u2013\nsensitive tips in AFM experiments, with the nanotube attached to the end of a conventional\nAFM tip to extend the effective range of resolution of the device.37 A similar apparatus\ncould be used to bring a nanotube into position to act as the cantilever in our which\u2013\npath experiment, either in the geometrical configuration explicitly considered above or some\nvariation of it which would lead to slightly different geometrical factors, but not change the\nunderlying linear form of the cantilever\u2013dot interaction.\nIn this appendix we carry out an analysis of the coupling between the cantilever and the\nelectron on the dot, and the normal modes of a nanotube cantilever. We verify the linear\ndependence of the cantilever energy on the electric field assumed in the text and derive\nthe form of the coupling constant, \u03bb. By examining the mode spectrum of a nanotube\ncantilever, we confirm the possibility of obtaining a cantilever with a fundamental flexural\nmode of order 108 Hz, and justify our assumption that for any given cantilever it is sufficient\nto consider just the lowest mode.\n1. Cantilever\u2013Dot Coupling\n\nWe begin by determining the relation between the maximum electric field at the surface\nof the dot and the voltage applied to the conducting cantilever, before analysing the details\nof the effect of the electron on the cantilever energy.\nWe will consider a cantilever of length L \u223c 1 \u03bcm, positioned so that its tip lies over\nthe centre of the dot and at a height d \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm.24 When an extra electron is added to\nthe dot it will cause a (classical) vertical displacement of the tip z \u226a d. We treat the\ncantilever as a conducting needle, since it's length will be far greater than either of the\nother two dimensions. An applied voltage induces a line charge density, \u03c3, on the cantilever,\nbut because the cantilever is necessarily finite in length, the charge density is not entirely\nuniform and so for an exact treatment we should write the line charge density as \u03c3(x) where\nx runs along the length of the cantilever from the tip (x = 0). However, for a cantilever\nwith a large enough aspect ratio, the charge density can be approximated as constant with\n22\n\n\fonly a small error [the error is of order \u03b4 with \u03b4 \u22121 = 2 ln(L/r), where r is the radius, for a\nrod shaped cantilever38 ]. For the cantilever we are considering the radius may be as small\nas 1.5nm, as we discuss below, and so the error in assuming a uniform charge density will be\nless than 10%, which is acceptable as our aim is to obtain an order of magnitude estimate\nfor the interaction strength.\nThe charge induced on the cantilever leads to an electric field at the surface of the dot,\nE=\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\u03c3(\u2212x\u00ee + d\u0135)dx\n,\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 (x2 + d2 )3/2\n\n(A1)\n\ntaking \u03c3 = cV where c is an unimportant constant and V is the voltage applied to the\ncantilever. The unit vectors are defined so that \u00ee runs along the cantilever away from its tip\nand \u0135 points down from the tip towards the dot. Since L \u226b d, we find\n21/2 cV\n.\n|E| \u2243\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 d\n\n(A2)\n\nWe also need to know how the potential energy of the cantilever varies for small vertical\ndisplacements, z, about the equilibrium position, d0 , where d = d0 \u2212 z. For a section of the\ncantilever of length \u2206x centered at x, the potential energy due to the displacement is\n\u03a6(x) =\n\nqcV \u2206x\nq\n\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 (d0 \u2212 z)2 + x2\n\n,\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere q = \u2212e is the excess charge on the dot. Since d0 \u226b z, we obtain the z\u2013dependent\npart of the potential energy as\n\u03a6z (x) = z\n\nqcV d0 \u2206x\n.\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 [d20 + x2 ]3/2\n\n(A4)\n\nThis is of course linear in z as we anticipated in our model. However, in order to obtain\nthe effective coupling between the electric field and each of the cantilever modes we need to\nrewrite the z\u2013dependent part of the potential energy in terms of the normal modes of the\ncantilever and so we turn now to the mode spectrum of the cantilever.\n2. Cantilever Modes\n\nA single\u2013walled nanotube cantilever can be obtained with lengths \u223c 1 \u03bcm, diameters\n\u223c 3 nm, and a Young's modulus \u223c 1 TPa.39 Recent experiments,29,40 have shown that the\nflexural modes of such nanotubes have frequencies which lie in the MHz\u2013GHz regime. We\ncan treat a nanotube as a rigid hollow rod and so obtain the frequencies of the flexural\nmodes,41\n\u03b22\n\u03c9i = i 2\n2L\n\ns\n\nY (a2 + b2 )\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere a and b are the outer and inner diameters, L the length, Y the Young's modulus and\n\u03c1 the density of the tube. The factors \u03b2i arise from geometrical considerations and are the\nsolutions of the equation cos(\u03b2i ) cosh(\u03b2i ) = \u22121.\n23\n\n\fThe energy of the cantilever can be written in terms of its classical normal modes as\nH=\n\n1\np2\nm\u03c9i2 qi2 + i Ii ,\n2\n2m\n!\n\nX\ni\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere\nIi =\n\n1\nL\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\u03932i dx\n\n(A7)\n\nand\n\u0393i (L \u2212 x) = [cos(\u03b2i ) + cosh(\u03b2i )][sin(\u03b2i x/L) \u2212 sinh(\u03b2i x/L)]\n\u2212[sin(\u03b2i ) + sinh(\u03b2i )][cos(\u03b2i x/L) \u2212 cosh(\u03b2i x/L)]\n\n(A8)\n\nare the vibrational mode eigenfunctions.41 If we modify the definitions of the canonical\n1/2\n1/2\nvariables slightly to define qi\u2032 = qi Ii and p\u2032i = pi Ii , then the Hamiltonian takes the\nconventional form\nH=\n\n(p\u2032 )2\n1\n.\nm\u03c9i2 (qi\u2032 )2 + i\n2\n2m\n!\n\nX\ni\n\n(A9)\n\nWe can add in the additional potential energy due to small amplitude deflections in the\nelectric field by expanding the displacement z in terms of the normal modes,\nV (z) = \u2212\n\nX\ni\n\necV d0\n\nZ\n\n1/2\n\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 Ii\n\nL\n\n0\n\n!\n\n\u0393i (x)dx\nq\u2032,\n[(x \u2212 L)2 + d20 ]3/2 i\n\n(A10)\n\nwhere the origin of x has been shifted.\nWe can quantise the full Hamiltonian for the cantilever in the usual way, and so we are\nable to associate a position operator of the form\nq\u0302i\u2032\n\n=\n\nh\u0304\n2m\u03c9i\n\n!1/2\n\n(\u00e2\u2020i + \u00e2i )\n\n(A11)\n\nwith each mode. Thus, it follows that the interaction between the electron on the dot and the\ncantilever can be written in the form proposed [Eq. (11)] with a coupling constant between\nthe cantilever and the dot which depends on the mode we are considering:\n\u03bbi = eE\u03bei\n\ns\n\nh\u0304\n,\n2m\u03c9i\n\n(A12)\n\nwhere \u03bei is a dimensionless constant of order unity defined by the relation\n\u03bei =\n\nd20\n(2Ii )1/2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL\n\n\u0393i (x)dx\n.\n[(x \u2212 L)2 + d20 ]3/2\n\n(A13)\n\nWe can see from Eqs. (19) and (24) that the effect of a particular cantilever mode on\nthe electron interference in the which\u2013path device depends on (\u03bbi /h\u0304\u03c9i )2 , rather than on \u03bbi\nalone. Thus, the ratio of the coupling between the fundamental and the ith excited mode\n24\n\n\fgoes as (\u03c90 /\u03c9i )3 = (\u03b20 /\u03b2i )6 . Because the electric field is strongly limited, we will always\nbe working in the regime where the coupling constant is just sufficient to cause detectable\neffects. Therefore, since (\u03b20 /\u03b21 )6 \u223c 0.005, our assumption that only the fundamental mode\nis relevant is justified.\nAs a concrete example, we consider a nanotube cantilever of length 1.4 \u03bcm and outer\nradius 3.3 nm.39 In this case, the fundamental frequency is 140 MHz and the mass is of order\n8 \u00d7 10\u221220 kg. If the tip\u2013dot distance is set at \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm, then \u03be0 \u223c 1.3 and for a maximum\nelectric field of 105 V/m, the corresponding maximum coupling constant \u03ba = \u03bb/h\u0304\u03c90 \u223c 3.\nAPPENDIX B: NON\u2013PERTURBATIVE CALCULATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL\nCOUPLING\n\nIn Sec. V, we calculated the transmission amplitude through the dot, including the effect\nof the cantilever's environment, by expanding to second order in the interaction between the\ncantilever and the electron on the dot, \u03bb, and then re-exponentiating. In this appendix,\nwe justify this result with a full calculation. The fact that a second order expansion in \u03bb\nleads to the exact result is at first somewhat surprising. However, the important step is the\nre-exponentiation of the truncated series expansion (52): we implicitly equate the influence\nfunctional with not just the first few terms in an expansion, but with an infinite series of\nterms which are themselves composed of products of the second order terms we evaluated.\nThis procedure is generally acceptable as an approximation in the limit of small \u03bb, but in\nthis particular case the series generated in fact coincides with the exact form obtained from\na linked cluster expansion.42\nWe begin by adopting the notation\n\u00d4(t) = \u2212e(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\u00d4 \u2020 (t) = \u2212e(i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n0\nt\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 F\u0302 (t\u2032 )e(i\u03c90 +\u03b3)t\n\n\u2032\n\ndt\u2032 F\u0302 \u2020 (t\u2032 )e(\u2212i\u03c90 +\u03b3)t ,\n\nso that\n\u00e2(t) = \u00e2(0)e(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t + \u00d4(t)\n\u00e2\u2020 (t) = \u00e2\u2020 (0)e(+i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t + \u00d4 \u2020(t).\nThe operators \u00d4(t) and \u00d4 \u2020 (t) operate only on the variables of the oscillator bath and they\nboth commute with \u00e2(0) and \u00e2\u2020 (0) which operate on the states of the cantilever alone.\nThe object which we wish to evaluate is the influence functional\n\u001c\n\n\u2212i\n\nTt e\n\nRt\n0\n\nWI (t\u2032 )dt\u2032 /h\u0304\n\n\u001d\n\n*\n\ni\u03bb\n\n= Tt e\n\nR th\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u00e2(0)e(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t +\u00e2\u2020 (0)e(+i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t\n\n\u2032\n\ni\n\ndt\u2032 /h\u0304\n\n+\u001c\n\ni\u03bb\n\nTt e\n\nRt\n0\n\n\u001d\n\n[\u00d4(t\u2032 )+\u00d4\u2020 (t\u2032 )]dt\u2032 /h\u0304 ,\n(B1)\n\nwhere we have exploited the commutation properties of the operators to factor the expression\ninto two terms, which we can now write as C1 \u00d7 C2 .\nThe method we use to evaluate C1 and C2 is based on the application of Wick's theorem,\nas described in the books by Mahan42 and Louisell.34 We can write the first term as\n25\n\n\f*\n\nhR\n\ni\u03bb\n\nC1 = Tt e\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ni\n\n\u00e2(0)e(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t +\u00e2\u2020 (0)e(+i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t dt\u2032 /h\u0304\n\n+\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nin Un (t),\n\n(B2)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere\nUn (t) =\n\ni\nD h\nt\n(\u03bb/h\u0304)n t\ndt1 . . . dtn Tt \u00e2(0)e(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t1 + \u00e2\u2020 (0)e(+i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)t1 . . .\n0\n0\niE\nhn!\n(\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)tn\n\u00d7 \u00e2(0)e\n+ \u00e2\u2020 (0)e(+i\u03c90 \u2212\u03b3)tn .\nZ\n\nZ\n\nAn obvious simplification arises from the fact that the averages over odd numbers of operators will always vanish and so we can replace n by the even index 2m.\nWe now apply Wick's theorem which allows us to write the average of products of pairs\nof operators as products of the averages of pairs of operators.
