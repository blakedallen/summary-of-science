Recent studies have revealed\nthat the chirality often plays an important role in the ordering of certain frustrated\nmagnets.

Introduction\nFrustration often gives rise to new interesting phenomena in the magnetic ordering of spin systems. One interesting consequence of spin frustration in vector spin\nsystems might be the possible appearance of \"chiral\" degrees of freedom. \"Chirality\"\nis a multispin quantity representing the sense or the handedness of the noncollinear\nspin structures induced by spin frustration. While the chirality has long been a familiar concept in the field of molecular chemistry, it was introduced into the field of\nmagnetism first by Villain [1]. Recent studies have revealed that the chirality often\nplays a very important role in the magnetic ordering of frustrated spin systems.\nIn this article, I will take up two such examples, stacked-triangular antiferromagnets and spin glasses, where the inherent chiral degree of freedom leads to new\ninteresting phenomena not encountered in unfrustrated magnets. The first topic is the\ncriticality of the magnetic phase transition of vector (i.e., XY and Heisenberg) antiferromagnets on the three-dimensional (3D) stacked-triangular lattice. Some time ago,\nthe present author proposed that these frustrated triangular magnets, e.g., CsMnBr3\nand VBr2 , might exhibit novel critical behavior, possibly lying in a new \"chiral\" universality class, distinct from the standard Wilson-Fisher universality class [2, 3, 4, 5].\nWhile this prediction have been supported by most of subsequent experiments, other\ntheorists indicated that the transition was weakly first order, and the subject still\nremains controversial [6]. In this article, I wish to review the present status of the\nstudy, and discuss what to be done in the future to further clarify the situation.\nThe second topic is the nature of the spin-glass ordering. Our present understanding of the nature of the experimentally observed spin-glass (SG) transition and of the\nSG ordered state still remains unsatisfactory [7]. Although the chirality has rarely\nbeen invoked in the standard scenario of the SG ordering, I with to explain here one\npromising scenario presented some time ago based on the spin-chirality decouplingrecoupling mechanism [8]. In this scenario, chiral-glass order , which is expected to\noccur in a fully isotropic 3D Heisenberg SG, plays an essential role. I examine some\n2\n\n\fof the consequences of this scenario, particularly in light of the experimental results\non canonical SG.\n\n\u00a72. Chirality\nFrustration in vector spin systems often gives rise to the noncollinear or noncoplanar spin orderings. Such canted spin structures generally give rise to the nontrivial\nchiral degrees of freedom. Chirality basically represents the handedness of such noncollinear (noncoplanar) spin structures. Two different types of chiralities have often\nbeen discussed in the literature: One is called a vector chirality and the other a scalar\nchirality.\n\nFigure 1:\nTwo chiral states in the ground-state spin configurations of\nantiferromagnetically-coupled three vector spins on a triangle. These chiral states\nare characterized by the vector chirality.\nChiral states representing the right- and left-handed configurations are illustrated\nin Fig.1 for an example of three antiferromagnetically coupled XY spins located at\neach corner of a triangle. The ground-state spin configuration is a well-known 120\u25e6\nspin structure, in which each XY spin on a plane makes an angle equal to \u00b1120\u25e6\nwith the neighboring spins. One may define the chirality of the first type, the vector\nchirality, via a vector product of the two neighboring spins, averaged over three spin\npairs, by\ni\n2 X h~\n~j .\n\u03ba= \u221a\nSi \u00d7 S\nz\n3 3 <ij>\n\n3\n\n\fEvidently, the sign of \u03ba represents each of the two chiral states, i.e., either a righthanded (clockwise) state for \u03ba > 0 or a left-handed (counterclockwise) state for \u03ba < 0.\nIn the case of XY spins considered here, the chirality \u03ba is actually a pseudoscalar :\nIt remains invariant under global SO(2) proper spin rotations while it changes sign\nunder global Z2 spin reflections. Hence, in order to transform one chiral state to the\nother, one needs to make a global spin reflection. The chiral order is closely related\nto the spontaneous breaking of a discrete Z2 spin-reflection symmetry.\nWhen the spins in Fig.1 are Heisenberg spins with three components, the groundstate spin configuration is again the coplanar 120\u25e6 spin structure, whereas in contrast\nto the XY case there no longer exists a discrete chiral degeneracy. This is because\nthe apparently right-handed chiral state can now be transformed into the apparently\nleft-handed chiral state via a continuous spin rotation of \u03c0 making use of the third\ndimension of the Heisenberg spin space. In this case, one may define the vector\nchirality as an axial vector by\n2 X ~\n~j .\n~\u03ba = \u221a\nSi \u00d7 S\n3 3 <ij>\nIn the case of three-component Heisenberg spins, there are occasions in which the\nordered state spin configuration is noncoplanar rather than coplanar. Such a noncoplanar ordered state is actually realized in a Heisenberg SG. In fact, a noncoplanar\nstate can sustain a discrete chiral degeneracy even in the case of Heisenberg spins,\nwhich is characterized by mutually opposite signs of the chirality of the second type,\nthe scalar chirality. It is a pseudoscalar defined for three neighboring spins by,\n~i * S\n~i+\u03b4 \u00d7 S\n~i+\u03b4\u2032 .\n\u03c7=S\nAn illustrative example is given in Fig.2.\nThese chiral degrees of freedom inherent to the noncollinear or noncoplanar spin\norderings often deeply affect the ordering of frustrated magnets, leading to novel\nphenomena not encountered in conventional unfrustrated magnets, as we shall see in\nthe next two sections.\n4\n\n\fc\na\n\nc\nb\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 2: Two chiral states associated with the noncoplanar spin structure formed\nby three-component Heisenberg spins. These chiral states are characterized by the\nscalar chirality.\n\u00a73. Critical properties of stacked-triangular antiferromagnets\nIn this section, I wish to deal with the novel critical behavior of XY and Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the 3D stacked-triangular lattice. The stacked-triangular\nlattice consists of 2D triangular layers stacked in register along the orthogonal direction directly on top of each other. There are several experimental realizations\nof the stacked-triangular antiferromagnet with nontrivial chiral degree of freedom.\nExamples are ABX3 -type compounds CsMnBr3 and CsVBr3 , or vanadium dihalides\nVCl2 and VBr2 , etc. Even Ising-like ABX3 -type compounds with an easy-axis-type\nanisotropy, such as CsNiCl3 , CsNiBr3 and CsMnI3 , exhibit the chiral critical behavior\nunder external fields higher than a certain critical field.\nThe ordered-state spin configuration in these chiral stacked-triangular antiferromagnets is a three-sublattice 120\u25e6 spin structure in each triangular layer. As was\nillustrated for the case of an isolated triangle, such an ordered state possesses a\nnontrivial chiral degree of freedom. This leads to the appearance of a new symmetry distinct from that of the standard unfrustrated magnets, and may give rise to\nmagnetic phase transitions of new universality class. Indeed, the present author suggested the possible occurrence of such a new universality class, chiral universality\nclass, on the basis of a symmetry argument [2, 4], Monte Carlo simulations [2, 5] and\nrenormalization-group (RG) calculations including the \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d and 1/n expansions\n5\n\n\f[3]. As usual, we mean here by n and d the number of spin components and the spatial\ndimensions, respectively, where the model is now extended to general n-vector spins\non a d-dimensional stacked-triangular lattice in which the 2D triangular layers are\nstacked in the remaining d\u22122 directions in a hypercubic fashion. Theoretical analyses\nof the critical properties of n-vector stacked-triangular antiferromagnets performed\nby various authors, however, lead to often ambiguous, and sometimes mutually conflicting results. Below, I will refer to several points of special interest, leaving other\ndetails to the review article [6].\nThe RG \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d expansion based on an appropriate Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson\nHamiltonian yields a new fixed point associated with the noncollinear criticality, distinct from the standard Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This new fixed point, which we\ncall a chiral fixed point, exists stably in a certain region of the parameter space, at\nleast for sufficiently large n meeting the condition, n > 21.8 \u2212 23.4\u01eb + 7.1\u01eb2 + O(\u01eb3 )\n[3, 9]. For n smaller than this critical value, the transition is likely to be first order.\nThe 1/n expansion result is also consistent with the \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d expansion result, yielding a continuous transition with a set of novel critical exponents for any 2 < d < 4\n[3]. The question still remaining is what happens at the physical point, i.e., n = 2\nor 3 at d = 3. Two possibilities seem to exist: (i) The critical value nc (d = 3) is\nsmaller than, or equal to the physical value n = 2 or 3. If this is the case, a real\nsystem exhibits a continuous transition of new chiral universality. (ii) The critical\nvalue nc (3) is greater than the physical value n = 2 or 3. If this is the case, a real\nsystem exhibits a first-order transition.\nThe present author originally suggested, partly based on an extrapolation of the\nlow-order \u01eb-expansion result, but mainly based on the Monte Carlo observation, that\nthe case (i) was a rather likely situation [3]. By contrast, some other theorists argued\nthat the case (ii) was more likely: For example, on the basis of the Borel-Pad\u00e9 resummation of the \u01eb-expansion, Antonenko et al estimated the critical value as nc (3) \u2243 3.39\nwhich turned out to be slightly above the physical value n = 3. Thus, the subject\n\n6\n\n\fstill remains controversial.\nAlmost all Monte Carlo (MC) simulations so far made on the XY (n = 2) and\nHeisenberg (n = 3) stacked-triangular antiferromagnets yielded a continuous transition characterized by the set of novel exponents distinct from the standard O(n) exponents [5, 10, 11, 12]. We show in Table I various critical exponents and specific-heat\namplitude ratio as determined by several MC simulations for the stacked-triangular\nHeisenberg (n = 3) antiferromagnet. As is clear from Table I, the MC values reported\nby different authors agree with each other, but are inconsistent with the standard\nHeisenberg values. They also deviate considerably from the O(4) or the mean-field\ntricritical values suggested in Ref.[13] on the bases of the RG \u01eb = d \u2212 2 expansion.\nSince the simulations are performed for finite lattices, one cannot completely rule\nout the possibility that an indication of a first-order transition eventually develops\nfor still larger lattices. A signature of such a first-order transition, however, has not\nbeen observed up to the linear size L = 60. Thus, the MC results so far obtained\nare in favor of the chiral-universality scenario. We note in passing that the numerical\nsituation in the XY (n = 2) case is also similar to the Heisenberg (n = 3) case: See\nRef.[6] for details.\nWe have included in Table I the chirality exponents of the Heisenberg stackedtriangular antiferromagnet as determined by MC, where \u03b2\u03ba and \u03b3\u03ba refer to the chiral\nlong-range order and the conjugate chiral susceptibility exponents, respectively. The\nRG analysis of Ref.[3] indicated that the chirality was a new relevant operator at the\nchiral fixed point. Although the chirality orders simultaneously with the spin, characterized by the same chiral correlation-length exponent \u03bd\u03ba as the spin correlationlength-exponent \u03bd, the chirality carries its own anomalous dimension which is different\nfrom the spin anomalous dimension. The chirality has a unique chiral crossover exponent \u03c6\u03ba = \u03b2\u03ba + \u03b3\u03ba , with satisfying the scaling relation \u03b1 + 2\u03b2\u03ba + \u03b3\u03ba = 2. These RG\npredictions were also supported by the MC results of Ref.[3].\nFollowing the theoretical suggestion of a new chiral universality class, various ex-\n\n7\n\n\fperiments have also been performed on stacked-triangular antiferromagnets to test the\nprediction. The critical exponents and the specific-heat amplitude ratio experimentally determined for the XY (n = 2) chiral magnets, e.g., CsMnBr3 [14, 15, 17, 18, 16]\nand CsNiCl3 (CsMnI3 ) above the critical (multicritical) field [19, 20, 21, 22], are summarized in Table II. All experiments reported that the transition was continuous.\nSeveral theoretical values are also shown for comparison, including the n = 2 chiral\nvalues of Ref.[5]. As can be seen from Table II, these experimental values are consistent with each other, and are in favor of the chiral-universality scenario. We note\nthat the experimental situation in the Heisenberg case is also similar to the XY case:\nSee Refs.[6] and [23] for details.\nAt this point, I wish to add a few comments. First, even when the chiral fixed\npoint is stable with a finite basin of attraction in the parameter space, it is still\nentirely possible that some systems possessing the full chiral symmetry exhibit a\nfirst-order transition. This occurs only if the initial Hamiltonian characterizing the\nsystem happens to lie outside the basin of the chiral fixed point. Here the difference\nbetween the two classes of systems, one showing a continuous chiral transition and\nthe other a first-order transition, is not of symmetry origin, but arises simply from\nthe nonuniversal details of the microscopic parameters. Possible examples of chiral\nsystems showing a first-order transition might be certain matrix models with the rigid\nnoncollinear structures. Indeed, the initial RG Hamiltonians describing these matrix\nmodels are likely to be located in the runaway regime of the RG flow, outside the\nstability domain of the chiral fixed point [6]. Conversely, this observation means that,\neven if one finds a few chiral systems exhibiting a first-order transition, it does not\nimmediately exclude the possibility that still another class of systems with the same\nchiral symmetry exhibit a continuous transition belonging to chiral universality.\nSecond, the \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d expansion suggests that the critical value of nc (d = 3)\nmay lie very close to the physical value n = 2 or 3. If nc (3) lies above the physical\nvalue only very slightly, there is no stable fixed point in the strict sense (the chiral\n\n8\n\n\ffixed point becomes slightly complex-valued). Nevertheless, the associated RG flow\nbehaves for a long period of RG iterations as if there were a stable fixed point. Thus,\na \"shadow\" of the complex-valued chiral fixed point in the real plane attracts the\nRG flow up to a certain scale, which could be very long, but, eventually, the flow\nescapes away from such a pseudo-fixed point showing a runaway characteristic of a\nfirst-order transition. Physically, this means that the system exhibits a rather welldefined critical behavior governed by the (slightly complex-valued) chiral fixed point\nfor a wide range of temperature, but eventually, the deviation from such a critical\nbehavior sets in for sufficiently close to Tc , and the system exhibits a weak first-order\ntransition. We emphasize here that, as long as nc (3) lies very close to the physical\nvalue, the situation would virtually be indistinguishable for all practical purposes\nfrom the case of a truly stable chiral fixed point, in the sense that almost universal\nnovel critical behavior is observed for a variety of chiral systems in a wide temperature\nrange up to very close to Tc [6].\nThird, besides the \u01eb = 4 \u2212 d and 1/n expansions, there is another perturbative\nRG scheme called the \u01eb = d \u2212 2 expansion [13, 24]. This method applied to the\nn = 3 chiral systems yielded a continuous transition characterized by the standard\nO(4) criticality. Meanwhile, as shown above, such an O(4) behavior has not been\nobserved either numerically nor experimentally in the magnetic ordering of stackedtriangular antiferromagnets. The possible reason of this failure of the \u01eb = d \u2212 2\nexpansion was discussed by several authors [24, 25, 27, 26]. One reason might be\nthat the nonperturbative effects associated with the topological defects, which might\nplay a vitally important role in the phase transition of chiral systems, was completely\nneglected there [24, 25]. In particular, if the n = 3 chiral system in d = 2 dimensions\nexhibits a pure topological phase transition at a finite temperature driven by the\ndissociation of the Z2 vortices, as first suggested in Ref.[28] and numerically supported\nin Refs.[29, 30, 31], the \u01eb = d \u2212 2 expansion should completely fail even at and near\ntwo dimensions. Then, to construct a phase diagram of the chiral system in the entire\n\n9\n\n\fd \u2212 n plane (2 \u2264 d \u2264 4) remains as an open question.\nBefore concluding this section of stacked-triangular antiferromagnets, I wish to\nbriefly discuss the future problems and challenges, mainly on experimental side.\ni) The first obvious direction is to perform high-precision experiments (or numerical simulations) to see whether the chiral transition is either continuous or first order,\nand to precisely determine the associated critical exponents and amplitude ratio. In\nparticular, if the chiral transition is really of weakly first order, it should eventually\nshow up in high-precision experiments as a finite latent heat or a finite discontinuity\nin certain physical quantities. In doing this, one has to choose appropriate materials\ncharacterized by the full chiral symmetry. Otherwise, a weak but nonzero perturbation of lower symmetry, e.g., the ones arising from the lattice distortion as in the\ncases of RbMnBr3 and CsCuCl3 , would cause a crossover to the non-chiral behavior\nin a close vicinity of Tc , irrespective of the eventual stability of the chiral fixed point.\nii) The other direction is to further examine the underlying universality of the\nnovel chiral critical behavior, i.e., to examine the critical properties from one material\nto the other. If the novel chiral criticality is to be observed in various chiral magnets\nin common, it should be a good experimental proof that there indeed exists a chiral\nfixed point behind the phenomena.\niii) Another interesting point, closely related to the point ii) above, is to examine the critical properties of helical magnets (spiral magnets), which is expected to\nlie in the same universality class as the stacked-triangular antiferromagnets. So far,\nthe critical properties of helimagnets with nontrivial chiral degrees of freedom have\nbeen studied almost exclusively for rare-earth metals, Ho, Dy and Tb. However, the\nsituation for rare-earth helimagnets has remained confused for years now [6]. Apparently, there are serious problems associated with the long-range nature of the RKKY\ninteraction, or with the possible contribution of the second length scale arising from\nthe disorder-containing skin part of the sample. One way to avoid these complications might be to make measurements on insulating helimagnets such as VF2 and\n\n10\n\n\f\u03b2\u2212MnO2 , and I urge experimentalists to try such experiments.\niv) Since the chirality is a quantity characteristic of the novel chiral criticality,\na direct experimental observation of the chirality would be very useful. Recently,\na significant progress in this direction was made by Plakty et al , who determined\nby using elaborate experimental technique the critical behavior of the chirality for\nthe stacked-triangular antiferromagnets CsMnBr3 and CsNiCl3 [32]. The determined\nchirality exponents are compared with the prediction of the chiral universality quite\nsuccessfully.\nWe finally note that, while the chiral degrees of freedom inherent to stackedtriangular antiferromagnets and other chiral magnets give rise to the novel critical\nbehavior, quite possibly lying in a new universality class, the chirality itself behaves\nas a composite operator of the order parameter of the transition, the spin. In other\nwords, the spin and the chirality are not decoupled here, and there is only one diverging length scale in the transition. Under certain circumstances, however, even this\nproperty could change, as we shall see in the next section on the SG ordering.\n\n\u00a74. Ordering in spin glasses\nSpin glasses are the type of random magnets in which both ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic interactions coexist and compete, thereby giving rise to the effects of frustration and quenched randomness. Since the experimental discovery of a\nsharp transition-like phenomenon in typical SG magnets, particularly in the so-called\ncanonical SG that are dilute metallic alloys such as AuFe and CuMn, their ordering\nproperties have been studied quite extensively both experimentally and theoretically\n[7]. Nevertheless, the true nature of the SG ordering still remains elusive, and is\nunder hot debate.\nSince we now have fairly convincing experimental evidences that typical SG magnets exhibit an equilibrium phase transition at a finite temperature, next obvious\nquestion is what is the true nature of the experimentally observed SG transition and\n11\n\n\fof the low-temperature SG state. We have not yet reached the full understanding of\nthis question. In theoretical studies of the ordering of SG, e.g., of the critical properties of the SG transition or of the issue of whether the SG state exhibits a spontaneous\nreplica-symmetry breaking (RSB), a simple Ising model with short-range interaction,\nthe so-called Edwards-Anderson (EA) model, has widely been used as a \"realistic\"\nSG model. One should bear in mind, however, that the magnetic interactions in many\nSG materials are nearly isotropic, being rather well described by an isotropic Heisenberg model, in the sense that the magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than\nthe exchange interaction. In apparent contrast to experiments, numerical simulations\nhave indicated that the standard SG order occurs only at zero temperature in the\n3D Heisenberg SG [33, 35, 8, 36, 37]. Although the magnetic anisotropy inherent to\nreal materials is often invoked to explain this apparent discrepancy with experiments,\nit still remains puzzling that no detectable sign of Heisenberg-to-Ising crossover has\nbeen observed in experiments which is usually expected to occur if the observed\nfinite-temperature transition is caused by the weak magnetic anisotropy[7, 33, 34].\nIn this section, I wish to explain one scenario of the experimental SG ordering presented some time ago by the present author, aimed at solving this apparent puzzle[8].\nIn this scenario, which may be termed as a spin-chirality decoupling-recoupling scenario, a scalar chirality introduced in \u00a72 plays an important role. This scenario\nconsists of two parts: The fist part is \"spin-chirality separation\" or \"decoupling\"\nfor the fully isotropic system, and the second part is the \"spin-chirality mixing\" or\n\"recoupling\" due to random magnetic anisotropy.\nRecent numerical simulations indicate that, in a fully isotropic Heisenberg SG in\n3D, the chirality is \"separated\" on long length and time scales from the spin, giving\nrise to a novel chiral-glass ordered phase in which only the scalar chiralities are ordered\nin a spatially random manner with keeping the spin paramagnetic [36, 37]. In other\nwords, in a 3D isotropic Heisenberg SG, the chiral-glass order precedes the SG order,\nTCG > TSG , the latter probably taking place only at T = TSG = 0. Furthermore, a\n\n12\n\n\frecent numerical simulation has revealed that the nature of the chiral-glass transition\nand of the chiral-glass ordered state might differ in some essential points from that of\nthe standard Ising SG [37]. First, the critical properties of the chiral-glass transition,\ncharacterized by the exponents \u03b2CG \u2243 1.1, \u03b3CG \u2243 1.5, \u03bdCG \u2243 1.2 and \u03b7CG \u2243 0.8 etc.,\ndiffer from those of the standard 3D Ising spin glass, characterized by the exponents\n\u03b2 \u2243 0.55, \u03b3 \u2243 4.0, \u03bd \u2243 1.8 and \u03b7 \u2243 \u22120.35, etc [44, 45, 46]. Second, the chiral-glass\nordered state is likely to exhibit a novel type of replica-symmetry breaking (RSB)\nwith a one-step-like character , in contrast to the case of the 3D Ising SG.\nOf course, the experimentally observed SG transition is associated with the freezing of the spin itself: Experimentally, the scalar chirality has not been directly measurable in SG so far. Since the chiral-glass order expected in a 3D isotropic Heisenberg\nSG does not accompany the spin order, it cannot immediately be connected with the\nexperimental SG ordering. At this point, we come to the second part of the scenario,\n\"spin-chirality recoupling\" or \"mixing\". Here, one assumes that the weak random\nmagnetic anisotropy inherent to real SG materials \"mixes\" or \"recouples\" the spin\nand the chirality, and the chiral-glass transition, which is hidden in the chiral sector\nin the absence of magnetic anisotropy, is now \"revealed\" in the spin sector. As long\nas the anisotropy is sufficiently weak, the nature of the SG transition and of the SG\nordered state should be governed by that of the chiral-glass transition and of the\nchiral-glass ordered state in the fully isotropic system. Note that it is not governed\nby the the SG transition and the SG ordered state of the fully isotropic system, since\nthe spin has been separated from the chirality there.\nOne can see such a spin-chirality mixing from a simple symmetry argument. The\nrandom magnetic anisotropy generally reduces the global symmetry of the Hamiltonian from O(3) = Z2 \u00d7 SO(3) to only chiral Z2 associated with the global spin\n\n~i \u2192 \u2212S\n~i . Note that the spin inversion flips the scalar chirality \u03c7i \u2192 \u2212\u03c7i ,\ninversion S\nsince \u03c7i is cubic in spins. As mentioned, in the fully isotropic case, the spin-chirality\nseparation is expected to occur. There, upon renormalization, the Hamiltonian is\n\n13\n\n\fasymptotically decoupled into the Z2 -symmetric chiral part and the SO(3)-symmetric\npart, where the Z2 chiral part is subject to a finite-temperature chiral-glass transition,\nwhile the SO(3) part remains disordered keeping the Heisenberg spin paramagnetic\neven in the chiral-glass ordered state. Suppose that a small amount of random magnetic anisotropy is added to the system. While the random magnetic anisotropy energetically breaks the SO(3) symmetry, the chiral-glass transition associated with the\nchiral Z2 symmetry would persist essentially unchanged, since the random anisotropy\npreserves the Z2 chiral symmetry and the Z2 chiral part has already been separated\nfrom the SO(3) part. In contrast to the fully isotropic case, once the chiral-glass\ntransition takes place and the Z2 symmetry is spontaneously broken, the spin is no\nlonger allowed to remain paramagnetic since the system now does not possess the\nSO(3) symmetry. Thus, the spin is now \"forced to order\" in the chiral-glass state\nvia the effective coupling between the spin and the chirality generated by the random\nmagnetic anisotropy.\nBased on this physical picture, one can derive various interesting predictions for\nthe real Heisenberg-like SG ordering. For example, the SG transition temperature in\nthe presence of random magnetic anisotropy of magnitude D is expected to behave\nfor small D as\n\n\uf8ee\n\nD\nTSG (D) \u2248 TCG (0) \uf8f01 + c\nkB TCG (0)\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ * * *\uf8fb ,\n\nwhere TCG (0) is the chiral-glass transition temperature of the fully isotropic system,\nand c is a numerical constant. Here note that TCG (0) is a quantity of O(J), not of\nO(D). Hence, in the D \u2192 0 limit, TSG (D) tends to a finite value of O(J) essentially\nin a regular way. The reason why the TSG (D) in the D \u2192 0 limit tends to TCG (0)\nassociated with the Z2 -symmetry breaking, not to TSG (0)(< TCG (0)) associated with\nthe SO(3)-symmetry breaking, is because the symmetry spontaneously broken at the\nSG transition under finite D is the chiral Z2 symmetry (spin-inversion symmetry),\nnot being the continuous SO(3) symmetry.\nThe nonlinear susceptibility for sufficiently weak D diverges toward T = TSG (D)\n14\n\n\fas\n\u03c7nl (D) \u2248 D 4 t\u2212\u03b3CG + [nondiverging term],\nwhere t is a reduced temperature t \u2261 |(T \u2212 TSG (D))/TSG (D)|. The susceptibility\nexponent here is nothing but the chiral-glass exponent in the fully isotropic system\n\u03b3 = \u03b3CG \u2243 1.5. The above equation indicates that the standard crossover behavior\nin the exponent does not occur even for weak D. In contrast, the amplitude of the\nleading singularity depends on D, vanishing in the isotropic limit. In this way, the\npresent chirality scenario gives a natural explanation of the abovementioned puzzles\nabout experiments, i.e., why the expected Heisenberg-to-Ising crossover has not been\nobserved experimentally, or why the SG transition occurs at a finite temperature of\norder J even in a nearly isotropic Heisenberg-like SG with weak anisotropy.\nAccording to the present chirality scenario, the critical properties of the SG transition of real Heisenberg-like SG should be the same as those of the chiral-glass transition of an isotropic Heisenberg SG, i.e., \u03b2 \u2243 1.1, \u03b3 \u2243 1.5, \u03bd \u2243 1.2 and \u03b7 \u2243 0.8.\nThese exponent values, though quite different from the values of the 3D Ising SG,\nhappen to be rather close to the experimental values for canonical SG. In Table III,\nI summarize the SG critical exponents experimentally determined for canonical SG\nsuch as AgMn, CuMn etc. One sees that the exponents determined by various authors\n[38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] come close to each other, yielding the values \u03b2 \u2243 1, \u03b3 \u2243 2,\n\u03bd \u2243 1.3 and \u03b7 \u2243 0.5. In Table III, we also give the corresponding exponent values of\nthe 3D Ising SG determined by recent extensive numerical simulations [44, 45, 46].\nEvidently, the experimental values for canonical SG deviate considerably from the\n3D Ising values, while they come rather close to the chiral-glass values quoted above,\ngiving some support to the chirality scenario.\nIt should be noticed that one cannot ascribe the cause of the observed large discrepancy between the experimental and the 3D Ising exponent values to the long-range\nnature of the RKKY interaction inherent to canonical SG. Although the RKKY interaction is expected to be a relevant perturbation in the spin ordering of 3D Heisenberg\n15\n\n\fSG [47], a scaling theory suggests that the 3D Heisenberg SG with the RKKY interaction lies just at its lower critical dimension (LCD) [47]. Generally, the system at its\nLCD is known to exhibit either a zero-temperature transition with an exponentially\ndiverging correlation length, or a finite-temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless-type transition without a finite long-range order but with an exponentially diverging correlation\nlength. In either case, \u03bd should be infinite, which is hardly consistent with the experimental result for canonical SG, \u03bd \u2243 1.3. Furthermore, the non-Ising exponents close\nto the ones obtained for canonical SG are also observed in an insulating Heisenberglike SG with short-range interaction, CdCrInS [43]: See Table III. These observations\nindicate that the cause of the non-Ising exponents experimentally observed in canonical SG cannot simply be ascribed to the RKKY interaction.\nThus, the chirality scenario turns out to naturally explain not only the origin of\nthe experimentally observed SG exponents, but also the reason why the expected\ncrossover has not been observed experimentally, or why the SG transition occurs at a\nfinite temperature of O(J) even in a nearly isotropic Heisenberg-like SG system. In\nfact, this scenario could also explain some other features where the standard theory\nmet some difficulty, such as the problem of magnetic phase diagram [48]. It also\nyields some new predictions, e.g., that the SG ordered state of real Heisenberg-like\nSG should exhibit a peculiar type of one-step-like RSB. Further details of the chirality\nscenario and its outcome will be given elsewhere [48].\n\n\u00a75. Concluding remark\nA brief review has been given on the two topics in the ordering of frustrated\nmagnets where the chirality plays an important role. One is the criticality of stackedtriangular antiferromagnets and the other is the ordering of spin glasses. In both cases,\nthe chirality gives rise to new interesting phenomena not encountered in standard\nunfrustrated magnets, such as \"chiral universality\" or \"spin-chirality separation\".\nWhile further works are required to settle the issues discussed in this article, it is\n16\n\n\falready clear that frustration indeed offers a unique stage where a variety of new\ninteresting ordering phenomena take place.\nThe author is particularly indebted to Dr. K. Hukushima for useful discussion\nand collaboration in a work cited in \u00a74.\nNote added to \u00a73 : Very recently, Pelissetto, Rossi and Vicari performed a RG loop\nexpansion at d = 3 up to six loops [A. Pelissetto, P. Rossi and E. Vicari, Phys.\nRev. B63, R140414 (2001)]. By determining the large-order behavior of the series\nand making a resummation, these authors found a stable chiral fixed point for both\ncases of n = 2 and 3 characterized by the exponents which were in good agreement\nwith experiments and MC. Note that the result is in sharp contrast to the previous\nlower-order (three-loops) result where no stable fixed was found.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J. Villain, J. Phys. C9, 4793 (1977).\n[2] H.
