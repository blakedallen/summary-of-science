Up to now, all the parities of reflection amplitude in the one-mode energy region are even\nunder the mirror operation. In this paper, we give an example of odd parity for Andreev reflection\n(AR) in a three-terminal graphene-supercondutor hybrid systems. We found that the parity is even\nfor the Andreev retroreflection (ARR) and odd for specular Andreev reflection (SAR). We attribute\nthis remarkable phenomenon to the distinct topology of the band structure of graphene and the\nspecular Andreev reflection involving two energy bands with different parity symmetry. As a result\nof odd parity of SAR, the SAR probability of a four-terminal system with two superconducting\nleads (two reflection interfaces) can be zero even when the system is asymmetric due to the quantum\ninterference of two ARs.\n\n1\n\n\fSince the experimental realization of graphene[3], it has become an exciting arena for\ntheoretical and technological investigations.[4] A number of new phenomena have been predicted and verified experimentally. For instance, in the presence of magnetic field, it exhibits\na distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect.[3] Its quasi-particles obey the Dirac-like equation and have relativistic-like behaviors.[4] Due to the relativistic effect, the Klein tunneling\noccurs where an incident electron in graphene can pass through a potential barrier with\nprobability one.[5] Then a graphene p-n junction can be used to focus Dirac electron current\nwith a negative refractive index.[6, 7]\nSince good contacts between superconducting leads and graphene have been realized experimentally,[8] the transport study through graphene based normal-metalsuperconductor (GNS) heterojunction becomes feasible. In the presence of a normal metal\n(graphene)-superconducting interface, an incoming electron converts into a hole and a cooper\npair is formed that enters the superconductor. Due to the relativistic nature of the electron\nin graphene, the electron-hole conversion can either be intraband (within conduction or valence band) or interband (between conduction and valence bands). When the electron-hole\nconversion is intraband, it corresponds to the usual Andreev reflection (AR)[9] or Andreev\nretroreflection (ARR) because the reflected hole is along the incident direction. This ARR\noccurs for both relativistic and non-relativistic electrons. When the electron-hole conversion\nis interband, the reflected hole is along specular direction and a specular Andreev reflection\n(SAR) takes place,[10] which can lead to novel phenomena as we will discuss below.\nIt is known that the parity is a fundamental quantity in physics and reflection is a\ngeneral physical phenomenon in nature. In this paper, we discuss the parity of reflection\namplitude for graphene in contact with superconductor leads. In general, the parity of a\nreflection amplitude can be either even or odd when the system is under mirror operation.\nHowever, for all previous known reflection events, the reflection amplitudes in the one-mode\nenergy region have even parity under the mirror operation. It is yet to find an odd-parity\nreflection event. In this paper, we found, for the first time, that the SAR amplitude has\nan odd parity under the mirror operation for zigzag graphene ribbons with even number\nof chains. This means that the phases of SAR amplitude for a graphene-superconductor\nhybrid system and its mirror system differ by \u03c0. We attribute this phenomenon to the\nunique band structure of the graphene. Obviously this phase difference does not affect\nany observable quantities for each system. When two systems couple together, however,\n2\n\n\fthis \u03c0 phase manifest through quantum interference between two SARs. So this \u03c0 phase\nshift has important consequences for a four terminal device with two superconducting leads\n(see Fig.2(a)). When two superconducting leads are symmetrically attached to the device,\nthe quantum interference of the left and right SAR leads to a destructive or constructive\ninterference depending on whether the phase difference of superconducting leads is zero or\n\u03c0. Importantly, when two superconducting leads are asymmetrically attached to the device,\nthe same interference pattern occurs provided that the Dirac point E0 is in line with the\ncondensate of superconducting lead. The quantum interference between pairs of the AR can\nbe tuned by shifting the Dirac point, the asymmetry of the two superconducting leads, as\nwell as the phase between two superconducting leads. Due to the odd parity of SAR, the\ninterference pattern for SAR is phase contrasted to that of ARR where the parity is even.\nBefore doing numerical calculation, we first prove that the phases of SAR amplitude of\ntwo systems (i) and (ii) in Fig.1(a) differ by \u03c0, i.e., the parity of SAR is odd under mirror\noperation. Note that for graphene systems electrons in valence and conduction band are\nusually referred as electrons and holes, respectively. In the presence of superconducting\nlead the reference point of electrons and holes is the Fermi level in the superconducting\nlead. In the following, we will refer electrons (holes) as electrons above (below) Fermi\nlevel in superconducting lead. Denote \u03c8c+ (\u03c8v+ ) the wavefunction of electrons in conduction\n(valence) band moving in +y direction and \u03c8c\u2212 (\u03c8v\u2212 ) in -y direction in the zigzag graphene\nnanoribbon lead. It was known that under reflection P\u0302 : x \u2192 \u2212x, \u03c8c\u00b1 is symmetric while\n\n\u03c8v\u00b1 is anti-symmetric if the energy of electron is in the first transmission channel[11][see\nFig.1(a)], i.e.,\nP\u0302 \u03c8c\u00b1 (x, y) = \u03c8c\u00b1 (\u2212x, y)\nP\u0302 \u03c8v\u00b1 (x, y) = \u2212\u03c8v\u00b1 (\u2212x, y).\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is one of the unique features of zigzag edge nanoribbons with even number of chains.\nAssuming the incident electron from the terminal-1, the wavefunctions for SAR \u03c81,3 in zigzag\nnanoribbon lead 1 or 3 of the system (i) can be written as\n(i)\n\n= \u03c8e+ + r11 \u03c8e\u2212 + r11A \u03c8h\u2212\n\n(i)\n\n= t13 \u03c8e+ + r13A \u03c8h+\n\n\u03c81\n\u03c83\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r11 is the normal reflection amplitude, t13 is the transmission amplitude, r11A and\n3\n\n\fr13A are the Andreev reflection amplitudes with the reflected hole to the terminal-1 and 3,\nrespectively. Similarly the wavefunctions for the system (ii) are given by\n(ii)\n\n= \u03c8e+ + r\u030411 \u03c8e\u2212 + r\u030411A \u03c8h\u2212\n\n(ii)\n\n= t\u030413 \u03c8e+ + r\u030413A \u03c8h+\n\n\u03c81\n\n\u03c83\n\n(3)\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nSince the system (i) is related to (ii) by the reflection operator P\u0302 , we have \u03c8\u03b1 = P\u0302 \u03c8\u03b1 with\n\u03b1 = 1, 3. Note that for SAR, the electron is in the conduction band while the hole is in the\nvalence band, i.e., \u03c8e = \u03c8c and \u03c8h = \u03c8v . From this relation together with Eqs.(1), (2), and\n(3), we obtain\nr11A = \u2212r\u030411A ,\nr11 = r\u030411 ,\n\nr13A = \u2212r\u030413A\n\nt13 = t\u030413\n\n(4)\n\nNote that the origin of this \u03c0 phase shift (odd parity) is the interband conversion from the\nelectron to the hole. Therefore the \u03c0 phase shift does not occur for ARR since it involves only\nintraband conversion. Now we verify this statement numerically using a tight-binding model\n(see below for detailed description of the model and numerical procedure). The numerical\nresults of AR probability R11A(13A) = |r11A(13A) |2 for two systems are shown in Fig.1(b). As\nexpected the AR probability are exactly the same for two systems. However, the phase\nof AR amplitudes r11A(13A) denoted as \u03a6i,ii\n11(13) are different. It is shown in Fig.1(c) and\nFig.1(d) that ARR amplitudes (|E0 | > |EF |, with |EF | = 0.5) are the same for two systems\nin Fig.1(a) while the SAR amplitudes (|E0 | < |EF |) have a \u03c0 phase shift. It confirms the\nodd parity for interband electron-hole conversion, which comes from the distinct topology\nof the band structure of graphene.\nTo see the consequence of the odd parity of SAR, we examine a symmetric four-terminal\ndevice with two superconducting leads depicted in Fig.2(a) (by setting asymmetry \u03b4N = 0\nand phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 = 0). For this system, two beams from terminal-1 has a \u03c0 phase\nshift due to odd parity of SAR and interferes destructively at terminal-3 giving rise to a\nvanishing SAR coefficient. However, we can arrive the same conclusion using symmetry\nargument as follows. Since the system is symmetric with respect to x = 0, we must have\nr13A = r\u030413A when the reflection operation along x-direction is applied. While from Eq.(4),\nr13A = \u2212r\u030413A . So the AR probability R13A = |r13A |2 for SAR can also be zero from symmetry\npoint of view.[12] Therefore we conclude that the symmetric device can not be used to test\n4\n\n\fthe odd parity of SAR. In the following, we demonstrate that due to the \u03c0 phase shift the\ndestructive interference still occurs in a four-probe devices with two superconducting leads\nattached asymmetrically and hence can be used to test the odd parity of SAR.\nFor this purpose, we consider an asymmetric four-terminal device consisting of a zigzag\ngraphene ribbon with two superconducting leads as shown in Fig.2(a). The Hamiltonian of\nP\nP\nthe graphene is[13] H0 = i \u01ebi a\u2020i ai \u2212 <ij> ta\u2020i aj . Here ai and a\u2020i are the annihilation and\ncreation operators at site i, \u01ebi is the on-site energy which can be controlled experimentally\nby the gate voltage[3], and the hopping constant t = 2.75eV represents the nearest carbon\nbond energy. The pair potential (energy gap) of superconducting terminal-\u03b2 with \u03b2 = 2, 4\n \u0303 \u03b2 = \u2206\u03b2 ei\u03c6\u03b2 with \u22062 = \u22064 = \u2206 \u2243 1meV . In numerical calculations,[12] we fix Fermi\nis \u2206\nenergy EF and tune the Dirac point E0 . We have used \u2206 as the energy unit.\nNow we study the interference between two ARs from GNS junctions as shown in Fig.2(a)\nin which two superconducting leads 2 and 4 are asymmetrically attached to the zigzag\nnanoribbon. The horizontal distance \u03b4N between two GNS junctions measures the asymmetry of two GNS junctions. The scattering process can be qualitatively understood as\nfollows. For simplicity, we assume \u03c62 = \u03c64 for the moment. As shown schematically in\nFig.2(a), for SAR the particle-like electrons in terminal-1 split into two beams and are scattered separately by two GNS junctions (green horizontal lines) as holes that finally recombine\nat terminal-3. We examine the total phase accumulated for each beam that involves the following three processes. Before reaching the first GNS junction (denoted by the left vertical\ngreen line) two beams of electrons propagate with the same momentum kx . After reaching\nthe second GNS junction (denoted by the right vertical green line) two beams of holes also\npropagate with the same momentum kx\u2032 . Obviously phases accumulated in the above two\nprocesses for both beams are the same. Between them two beams propagate with different\nmomenta kx and kx\u2032 . Hence the phase difference between two beams is \u03c6 = (kx \u2212 kx\u2032 )\u03b4x with\n\u221a\n\u03b4x = b\u03b4N, where b = 3a and a the lattice constant. This phase difference can be tuned\nby varying the Dirac point E0 or the asymmetry \u03b4N giving rise to a complicated interference pattern (see Fig.2). In particular, this phase difference can be zero if (kx \u2212 kx\u2032 ) = 0\n\n(i.e.,E0 = 0) or \u03b4N = 0. In general, the total phase difference is \u03c6 = (kx \u2212 kx\u2032 )\u03b4x + \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c64 .\nInterference pattern of AR probability R13A for system depicted in Fig.2(a) with pair\n\npotential phase difference of two superconductors \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 and \u03c0 (\u03b4\u03c6 \u2261 \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c64 ) are then\nplotted in Fig.2(b) and (c), respectively. For Fig.2(b) following observations are in order:\n5\n\n\f(1) For the geometrically symmetric system (\u03b4N = 0), the interference is always destructive\nwith zero R13A as long as |E0 | < |EF |.[12] Clearly this is due to the \u03c0 phase shift depicted\nin Fig.1(d) and is consistent with the band selection rule.[11] (2) When Dirac point E0 is\nin line with the condensate energy of the superconductor, i.e., when E0 = 0, R13A is again\nzero no matter what value \u03b4N assumes. This means that there is a completely destructive\ninterference between two beams scattered by two GNS junctions attached asymmetrically to\nthe graphene nano-ribbon. This behavior can be understood as follows. When E0 = 0 the\nincoming electron and reflected hole have the same propagating momentum kx and thus path\n1 and 2 in Fig.2(a) experience the same quantum phase kx \u03b4x except at the superconducting\nleads. Hence the total phase difference is only due to the \u03c0 phase shift between two SARs.\n(3) R13A is an even function of Dirac point E0 because of the electron-hole symmetry in\ngraphene. Due to the geometric symmetry, R13A is also an even function of asymmetry \u03b4N.\n(4) For nonzero EF , the closer the Dirac point E0 to EF , the more rapidly R13A oscillates\nas we vary \u03b4N. This is because the difference of propagating momentum kx \u2212 kx\u2032 increases\nmonotonically as E0 approaches to EF . (5) When E0 is in the vicinity of EF , R13A can\nreach 0.9 which is much larger than that when |E0 | > |EF |. This is because when EF is\nvery close to E0 , the edge states of zigzag ribbon begin to contribute, then electron is easier\nto be scattered by two GNS junctions located also at edges of zigzag ribbon. Considering\nthe pseudo-spin conservation, large R13A is always found in the region of |E0 | < |EF |, i.e.,\nthe SAR region. (6) There is an overall fine oscillation with a period of \u03b4N = 3b. Similar\nbehavior was also found in zigzag ribbons with a p-n junction where the conductance is\ndetermined by the relative displacement \u03b4 along the p-n junction.[14] In Fig.2(c) with the\nsuperconducting phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0, we see that the interference pattern is contrary to\n\u03b4\u03c6 = 0 [Fig.2(b)] where the constructive interference becomes destructive and vice versa.\nTo further analyze the interference pattern, we plot in Fig.3(a) the total R13A vs Dirac\npoint E0 for different asymmetry \u03b4N with the phase difference between two superconducting\nleads \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 [main panel of Fig.3(a)] or \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 [inset of Fig.3(a)]. Clearly the interference\n(oscillatory) pattern occurs only for asymmetric systems (\u03b4N 6= 0) with oscillation frequency\nproportional to \u03b4N. When pair potential phase difference \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 is introduced, the interference pattern reverses, and R13A with \u03b4N = 0 becomes the envelop function of R13A for\nall nonzero \u03b4N. In Fig.3(b) we plot R13A vs \u03b4N for different widths W of nanoribbon. It\nis shown clearly that R13A is a periodic function of \u03b4N with larger periodicity for larger W .\n6\n\n\fIn the inset of Fig.3(b) we plot this period versus the width for different E0 . The period\nP is obtained in two ways: (1). from the expression P = 2\u03c0/(kx \u2212 kx\u2032 ) where the momenta\n\nkx and kx\u2032 can be obtained from the band structure for a given E0 (black symbols). (2).\ndirectly from main panel of Fig.3(b) (red solid circle). From the inset, it clearly shows that\ntwo periods are exactly the same giving strong evidence that the interference pattern of AR\nprobability are indeed from two reflected hole beams.\nFinally, the interference pattern of AR probability R11A is also studied (not shown). We\nfound that only ARR probability R11A (|E0 | > EF = 0.2\u2206) exhibits interference pattern. We\nnote that since there is no \u03c0 phase shift involved in ARR, when \u03b4N = 0 reflected electrons\nthrough two GNS junctions interfere constructively when \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 and destructively when\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 which is in contrast to SAR in Fig.2. In fact, interference patterns of SAR and ARR\nare always phase contrast not only for \u03b4N = 0 but also for all other \u03b4N.\nTo test the odd parity of SAR experimentally, it relies on the fabrication of high quality\nzigzag graphene nanoribbons. It has been achieved by several laboratories using different methods last year including the method to unzip the multi-walled carbon nanotube\n(CNT),[15] the anisotropic etching by thermally activated nickel nanoparticles,[16] and use\nreconstruction of the edge to make zigzag graphene nanoribbons.[17] In view of the above\nexperimental breakthrough, we expect that the setup to test our predicted phenomenon can\nbe realized experimentally.\nTo reduce the experimental challenge, we have considered an unzipped CNT device, i.e.,\n(n,n) CNT-zigzag graphene-(n,n) CNT, obtained by unzipping a few unit cells in the central\npart of an armchair CNT which has been achieved experimentally.[15] For this system, the\nwavefunction in the armchair CNT has the same symmetry as that of the zigzag graphene\nribbon. Following the same procedure leading to Eq.(4), we have shown that the unzipped\nCNT in contact with a superconducting lead has the odd parity under mirror operation.\nSimilar conclusions drawn from GNS can be obtained for unzipped CNT with two superconducting leads.\nIn conclusion, up to now, the parity of reflection amplitude was found to be even under\nthe mirror operation. Here we have provided an example of odd parity for the reflection\namplitude, the SAR amplitude in the zigzag graphene-superconductor hybrid system. This\nodd parity is due to the combination of unique band structure of the graphene and the\nelectron-hole conversion involving two energy bands with different parity symmetry. The\n7\n\n\fsignature of odd parity of SAR can be found from the quantum constructive interference in a\nfour terminal system with two superconducting leads attached asymmetrically. Furthermore,\nthe interference pattern due to odd parity of SAR is phase contrasted to that of ARR where\nthe parity is even.\nAcknowledgement We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from a RGC\ngrant (HKU 705409P) from the Government of HKSAR and from NSF-China under Grant\nNos.10974236 and 10821403.\n\n[1] \u2217 e-mail: jianwang@hkusua.hku.hk.\n[2] \u2020 e-mail: sunqf@aphy.iphy.ac.cn.\n[3] K.
