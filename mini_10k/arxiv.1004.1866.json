Our theoretical model includes a simplified, semi-infinite geometry, in which infinitely rigid microtubules grow perpendicularly to a nucleating planar\nsurface (See Figure 2). Dogterom and Leibler studied this theoretical model with this\n2\n\n\fsemi-infinite geometry, neglecting concentration variations in the process of assembly and\ndisassembly of microtubules [DL]. In this model infinitely rigid microtubules are growing\nperpendicular to a nucleation planar surface (Fig. 2) and randomly switching between the\ngrowth state (+) and shrinkage state(\u2212) or polymerization and depolymerization.\nIn this model each microtubule switches randomly between the assembly state +, in\nwhich it grows with the average speed v + proportional to the local monomer density c, and\nthe disassembly state \u2212, in which it shrinks with the average speed v \u2212 . The frequencies of\nthe transitions between the two states, f+\u2212 (of the \"catastrophies\" from + state to \u2212 state)\nand f\u2212+ (the \"rescues\" from \u2212 state to + state), determine, together with v + , v \u2212 determine\nthe behavior of the model. We summarize now the main results obtained through Evan\nfunction and time-evolution simulations. The main result is the existence and stability\nof steady state solutions for a convection diffusion equation modeling the above-described\nprocess. The novelty in this study is the analysis of the general case when the dynamics\nparameter are depending on local concentration. The mathematical tools introduced to\nhandle the more complicated resulting equations should be of general use.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMicrotubules are natural polymers found inside of living eukaryotic cells. Each polymer\nsubunit is an obligate dimer of proteins synthesized from the alpha and beta tubulin genes.\nWhen concentrated above a threshold level, tubulin dimers bind to each other forming a\nbeta lattice of subunits that bind head to tail and side-to-side. Under appropriate conditions, the inherent curvature of the lattice sheet produces a tube, typically 13 subunits in\ncross-section, which can extend at the tube ends by polymerization to many thousands of\nsubunits [MK]. The resultant MT polymer serves as a semi-rigid structural element in the\ncell that is critical for intracellular distribution networks, chromosome segregation before\ncell division, and neuronal activity. MTs within cells are typically initiated from a complex\nof proteins that form a nucleation template. Polymerization proceeds at a rate that is dependent upon the concentration of free tubulin subunits. Over time, a remarkable phenomenon\nis observed both in cellular MTs and with purified tubulin. The MTs undergo stochastic\nswitching between states of polymerization and depolymerization, a process termed 'dynamic instability' [SGCOH]. Switching frequencies are modulated during certain cellular\ntransitions to alter the length distribution and density of the polymer array. The mechanisms governing dynamic instability are still an active subject of both experimental and\ntheoretical investigation [KM].\nIn general terms, the dynamic instability arises due to an energy dependent mechanochemical transition that occurs in the beta-tubulin half of the tubulin dimer after polymerization. MT polymerization proceeds in a head to tail fashion from the nucleation template\nleaving the beta-tubulin face exposed at the microtubule end. Free tubulin dimers rapidly\nbind guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a small molecule used as a convertible form of stored\nchemical energy in the cell. If the exposed beta-tubulin on the MT end is GTP-bound,\n3\n\n\fit has a relatively high affinity for binding the alpha-tubulin face of any free subunits in\nthe cytoplasm. Once bound, the beta-tubulin undergoes a structural change increasing the\nprobability of hydrolyzing the associated GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The binding affinity of GDP-bound subunits for other tubulin dimers is relatively low. Therefore,\nGTP hydrolysis serves as a switch for changing the binding affinity of the subunit. If the\nrate of GTP hydrolysis in the MT outpaces binding of new GTP-bound dimers, the MT\nwill lose its theorized cap of GTP-bound dimers and transit from a state of high affinity\ndimer binding to very low affinity. Over an important range of free tubulin concentrations,\nthis loss of the GTP-cap will result in a switch from polymerization to depolymerization,\ntermed 'catastrophe.' Should a GTP-bound dimer manage to bind the depolymerizing end,\nthe polymerization can be recovered, a process termed 'rescue.' The observed stochastic\nswitching between states of growth and shortening is attributed to the statistical variance\nin the processes associated with dimer binding and GTP hydrolysis.\nA closed form kinetic description of microtubule dynamics has not been successfully\nrendered to date. Several analytical models have been developed to describe how the major\nfactors leading to dynamic instability (i.e. growth and shortening velocities together with\ncatastrophe and rescue frequencies) will produce a steady state system of polymers under\nvarious conditions. The stochastic nature of the switching between polymerization states\ncomplicates the construction of determinative equations that can be numerically solved for\nproperties such as MT length distribution. In this work, we advance the analysis of MT\ndynamics by extending the analytical methods applied to the most prominent model for\ndynamics instability in an in vitro context [DL].\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nDichotomous Markov Noise\n\nThe dichotomous Markov noise (DMN) v(t), is a simple two-valued stochastic process such\nthat the state space of the random variable consists only two values {\u00b1v \u00b1 } with constant transition rates f\u2212+ and f+\u2212 . This means that the waiting-times in the two states are\nexponentially-distributed stochastic variables. The switches of v(t) are Poisson process with\nprobabilities p\u2212 and p+ [IB].

This computation is carried\nout in Appendix A.\nNote that the resultant procedure described gives in the end an analytic function of the\nparameters of the problem, which vanishes if and only if q1 and q2 have a common root. By\nproperties of analytic functions, it therefore vanishes either on a surface of measure zero in\nparameter space, or else for arbitrary choice of parameters. But, it is readily checked for\nspecific parameters that there is no common root (see Appendix A). Collecting information\nwe may conclude the following general fact.\nProposition 4.2.

Specifically, we look at the linearized time-evolutionary equations\nabout U+ ,\n(5.1)\n\n\u03bbU + B\u0303(U+ )U + A(U+ )Ux + CUxx ,\n\nwritten as a first-order system, and look again at the number of negative real part eigenvalues, or solutions \u03bc of the indicial equation\n(5.2)\n\n0 = det(\u03bbU + \u03bcA(U+ ) + B\u0303(U+ ) + \u03bc2 C)\n\non the domain \u039b := {\u03bb : <\u03bb \u2265 0} of interest for the later stability analysis.\nSetting \u03bc = i\u03be, \u03be real, we obtain the dispersion equation\n(5.3)\n\n0 = det(\u2212\u03bbU + i\u03beA(U+ ) + B\u0303(U+ ) \u2212 \u03be 2 C),\n\ndetermining a family of three curves\n(5.4)\n\n\u03bbj (\u03be) \u2208 \u03c3(i\u03beA(U+ ) + B\u0303(U+ ) \u2212 \u03be 2 C),\n\nj = 1, . . . , 3, where \u03c3(M ) denotes the spectrum (eigenvalues) of a matrix M .\nWe make the following standard assumption, verified in Section 5.1 for c+ small and\nchecked numerically for the specific cases treated in this paper.\nAssumption 5.1. The constant solution U \u2261 U+ is linearly stable, i.e.,\n(5.5)\n\n<\u03bbj (\u03be) \u2264 0\n\nfor all \u03be \u2208 <, with equality only for \u03be = 0.\nLemma 5.2. Under Assumption 5.1, the numbers of stable and unstable roots of \u03bc of (5.2)\nare independent of \u03bb for all <\u03bb \u2265 0, \u03bb 6= 0, and are both equal to three.\n\n12\n\n\fProof. The roots are continuous as functions of \u03bb, so for the first assertion we need only\ncheck that no roots can cross the imaginary axis, i.e., there are no roots \u03bc = i\u03be with \u03be\nreal and <\u03bb \u2265 0 and \u03bb 6= 0. But, this possibility is ruled out by Assumption 5.1. Thus,\nthe numbers of stable and unstable roots are constant. To determine their values, we may\ntake \u03bb \u2192 +\u221e along the real axis, and compute directly that in the limit there are three of\neach.\nCorollary 5.3. Under Assumption 5.1, the dimension of the stable manifold at states\nU+ \u2208 E is generically three.\nProof. By continuity of the roots of (5.2) with respect to \u03bb, together with the fact already\nestablished that at \u03bb = 0 there is generically a single zero root, we find, taking the limit as\n\u03bb \u2192 0, that there must be for \u03bb = 0 either two or three stable roots, depending whether the\nsingle zero root is the limit of a stable or of an unstable root as \u03bb \u2192 0. Since the number\nis odd, by our index computation, we conclude that the dimension is generically three.\nRemark 5.4. Note by our computations that we have obtained also the additional information, which will be important for later stability analysis, that the zero root at \u03bb = 0\nperturbs as the real part of \u03bb is increased to the unstable half plane. As we shall see\nlater, this has the important consequence that the single undamped mode governing \"total\ndensity\" p := p+ + p\u2212 is convected inward toward the boundary x = 0, and not away\ntoward x = +\u221e, and therefore the nonlinear stability theory may be treated by simpler\nweighted-norm methods [He, Sat] rather than the delicate pointwise methods of [YZ, NZ].\n\n5.1\n\nVerification for c+ small\n\nWe now verify Assumption 5.1 for c+ small, by explicit computation of the case c+ = 0.\nProposition 5.5.

(Note:\nthe fact that \u03b1 is real follows with no computation, simply from (5.10).) Moreover, we may\nverify <\u03bb1 (0) < 0, <\u03bb3 (0) < 0 by computing the characteristic polynomial\ndet(B\u0303+ \u2212 \u03bcI) = \u03bc(\u03bc2 + r\u03bc + s)\nand verifying the discriminant condition\n\u2212 2\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\nr2 \u2212 4s = (u+ p+\n+ + k + \u03c9c+ \u2212 f+ ) + 4(f+ k + u p+ ) > 0.\n\nFor c+ sufficiently small, <\u03b2 < 0, \u03b4 uniformly bounded, by continuity of the Taylor\ncoefficients in the limit. This establishes that <\u03bb2 \u2264 0 for \u03be near the origin, with equality\nonly at \u03be = 0. On the other hand, <\u03bb1 and <\u03bb2 by continuity are strictly negative on any\nbounded set of \u03be and all three are strictly negative (almost by inspection) in the limit as\n|\u03be| \u2192 \u221e. This establishes the assumption for c+ sufficiently small.\n\n5.2\n\nVerification for general c+\n\nFor general c+ , we verify Assumption 5.1 numerically in the course of our Evans function\ncomputations, via the following elementary observation.\n14\n\n\fLemma 5.6. For D, d > 0, Assumption 5.1 is equivalent to the property that for \u03bb pure\nimaginary and 0 < |\u03bb| \u2264 R, R > 0 sufficiently large, the number of roots \u03bc of indicial\nequation 5.2 with negative (resp. positive) real parts is constant and equal to three.\nProof. It is evident that for |\u03be| sufficiently large <\u03bbj (\u03be) \u2264 \u2212\u03b8\u03be 2 , some \u03b8 > 0. Thus, if\nAssumption 5.1 is violated, then <\u03bbj (\u03be) is pure imaginary for some 0 < |\u03be| \u2264 R, or,\nequivalently, there is a pure imaginary root \u03bc = i\u03be of the indicial equation 5.2 for some pure\nimaginary \u03bb with 0 < |\u03bb| \u2264 R. But, this means that either the number of negative real part\nroots or the number of positive real part roots must be less than three, or else the total of\nall roots would be at least seven, a contradiction.\nAs described below, the numbers of stable and unstable roots \u03bc of the indicial equation\nare checked at each step of our Evans function computations, in particular, on an imaginary\ninterval [\u2212iR\u0302, iR\u0302] with R\u0302 larger than the value R described above; see Remark 8.2.\n\n6\n6.1\n\nExistence of steady-state solutions\nGeneral theory\n\nWriting (3.12) in first-order form as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\nP\nU\n=\n(6.1)\n\u2212C \u22121 (A(U )P \u2212 B(U )U\nP x\nwith P := Ux , we obtain a six-dimensional dynamical system. The three boundary conditions at x = 0 determine a four-dimensional manifold of solutions (three free parameters\nin the initial value, plus one dimension in the direction of spatial-evolution for a particular\ninitial value at x = 0).\nBy Corollary 5.3, under Assumption 5.1, the stable manifold associated with a rest point\nU+ generically has dimension three. Thus, in looking for stationary solutions satisfying the\nboundary conditions at x = 0 and converging as x \u2192 +\u221e to a specified endstate U+ ,\nwe seek the intersection of a four-dimensional with a three-dimensional manifold, which\nshould generically consist of a one-dimensional manifold, or a finite union of distinct curves,\ncorresponding to distinct steady-state solutions.\nThat is, by a dimensional count, connections seem to be possible for all endstates U+ \u2208 E\nthat are stable as constant solutions, as (numerically) all examples considered seem to be.\nRemark 6.1. The above suggests, by formal matched asymptotic expansion, that behavior\nfar from the boundary (distance >> max{d, D}) of solutions of (3.3) should be governed\nby the inviscid equation Ut = A(U )Ux + B(U )U , with boundary condition U \u2208 E at x = 0,\nwhether for Dirichlet or Neumann conditions imposed in the full viscous equations, so long\nas the boundary layer (i.e., steady state solution connecting to E) is stable.

Stability of steadystate solutions of this system may be treated in straightforward fashion by the weighted\nnorm method of [Sat], as we now briefly describe, reducing the problem of determining\nnonlinear stability to that of checking spectral stability of the linearized operator about the\nwave. The simplicity of our treatment here is to some extent an accident of the favorable\nstructure of this specific problem. For (more complicated) methods applying to general\nsystems, see, e.g., [HZ, Z2] and references therein.\n\n7.1\n\nAbstract linearized equations\n\nLinearizing (3.3) about a steady state \u016a (x), we obtain the linearized equations\n(7.1)\n\nUt = LU := A(x)Ux + B(x)U + CUxx ,\n\nA(x) := A(\u016a (x)), B(x)V := B(\u016a (x))V + (dA(\u016a )V )\u016ax , with boundary conditions\n(7.2)\n\n7.2\n\n(p+ , p\u2212 , c) = (0, 0, 0) or (p+ , p\u2212 , cx ) = (0, 0, 0).\n\nAbstract eigenvalue equations and spectrum\n\nThe eigenvalue equations associated with (7.1) are\n(7.3)\n\n(L \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0\n\n17\n\n\f0.02\np+\np\u2212\nc\n\n0.018\n\n0.016\n\n0.014\n\n0.012\n\n0.01\n\n0.008\n\n0.006\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nFigure 3: Sample profile: (p+\n+ , p+ , c+ ) = (0, 0, 0), d = .1, D = 1, \u03c9 = 1, \u03bd = 1, f+ = 1,\nu+ = 1, \u03ba = 1.\n\nwith boundary conditions (7.2). Let W 1,\u221e as usual denote the Banch space of bounded\nmeasurable functions on x \u2208 [0, +\u221e) possessing a bounded measurable weak derivative,\nwith norm kf kW 1,\u221e := sup |f | + sup |f 0 |. Following [He], define the spectrum \u03c3(M ) of an\noperator M with respect to a given Banach space B to be the set of \u03bb \u2208 C for which (\u03bb\u2212M )\ndoes not possess a bounded inverse on B. Define the point spectrum \u03c3p (M ) of M to be the\nset of \u03bb \u2208 C for which (\u03bb \u2212 M )U = 0 has a nonzero solution in B, and the essential spectrum\n\u03c3ess (M ) of M to be the set of \u03bb \u2208 C that are in \u03c3(M ) but not in \u03c3p (M ).\nLemma 7.1.

The latter\npossibility is easily eliminated by a standard energy estimate, whence the result follows by\n(5.5) and the fact that \u03bb2 (0) = 0 (computed earlier).\n\n7.3\n\nThe method of weighted norms\n\nFollowing [Sat], introduce now the weighted norm\n(7.4)\n\nkU k\u03b7 := ke\u03b7x U kW 1,\u221e ,\n\n\u03b7 \u2265 0, and the associated Banach space B of functions with bounded k * k\u03b7 norm.

Making the change of variables U \u2192 e\u03b7x U following [Sat], we convert L to the\noperator\n(7.5)\n\nL\u0302 := C(\u2202x \u2212 \u03b7)2 + A(\u2202x \u2212 \u03b7) + B =: \u0108\u2202x2 + \u00c2\u2202x + B\u0302,\n\nwhere B\u0302 = B + \u03b7A, etc. (we need not compute \u00c2 and \u0108). Checking definitions, we find\nthat the spectrum of L with respect to B is the spectrum of L\u0302 with respect to W 1,\u221e .\nApplying the standard theory of [He] as in the proof of Lemma 7.1, we find that \u03c3ess (L\u0302)\nwith respect to W 1,\u221e is bounded on the left by the rightmost envelope of the dispersion\ncurves\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n\u03bb\u0302j (\u03be) \u2208 \u03c3(B\u0302+ + i\u03be \u00c2+ \u2212 \u03be C+ ) = \u03c3 B+ + (i\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)A+ + (i\u03be \u2212 \u03b7) C+ .\nObserving that \u03bbj are continuous in \u03b7, we find by Lemma 7.1 that, for 1/R \u2264 |\u03be| \u2264 R,\nR > 0 arbitrary, <\u03bbj < \u2212\u03b8, \u03b8 > 0 for \u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small. Likewise, <\u03bbj < \u2212\u03b8 for |\u03be|\nsufficiently large and \u03b7 sufficiently small, by domination of term C\u03be 2 .\nReferring now to the computations in the proof of Proposition 5.5, and following the\nnotation therein, we recall that <\u03bb1 and <\u03bb3 are strictly negative for all \u03be, so that the above\ncontinuity argument in fact gives <\u03bb\u03021 , <\u03bb\u03022 < \u2212\u03b8 for \u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small.\nHence, it remains only to check the behavior of \u03bb\u03022 for |\u03be| \u2264 1/R arbitrarily small.\nRecalling the Taylor expansion (5.10) of \u03bb2 (\u03be), and substituting \u03bb\u03022 (\u03be) = \u03bb2 (\u03be \u2212 \u03b7/i), we\nfind that\n<\u03bb\u03022 (0) = <i\u03b1(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7/i) + h(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7/i)2j ) + O(|\u03be \u2212 \u03b7/i|2j+1 ) = \u2212\u03b1\u03b7 + <h\u03be 2j + o(|\u03be|2j + \u03b7),\nwhere \u03b1 := LAR > 0 and h is the first term with nonzero real part in the Taylor expansion\nof \u03bb2 after \u03b1, by Assumption 5.1 necessarily an even-order term with <h < 0. Thus,\n<\u03bb\u03022 \u2264 \u2212\u03b8 < 0 for some \u03b8 < 0, for |\u03b7, \u03be| sufficiently small, completing the proof.\n19\n\n\f7.4\n\nBasic nonlinear stability theorem\n\nWe make a final assumption on stability of point spectrum of L.\nAssumption 7.3. <\u03c3p (L) < 0.\nTheorem 7.4. Under Assumptions 5.1 and 7.3, for \u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small, let \u0168 (x, t) be\na solution of (3.3) with initial data \u01680 such that ke\u03b7x (\u01680 \u2212 \u016a )kW 1,\u221e is sufficiently small.\nThen, ke\u03b7x (\u0168 \u2212 \u016a )kW 1,\u221e (t) decays to zero as t \u2192 \u221e, at rate\nke\u03b7x (\u0168 \u2212 \u016a )kW 1,\u221e (t) \u2264 Ce\u2212\u03b8t ,\nwhere \u03b8 = \u03b8(\u03b7) > 0. (Here, \u03b8(\u03b7) \u223c \u03b1\u03b7 as \u03b7 \u2192 0, where \u03b1 is as in (5.10).)\nProof. By Assumptions 5.1 and Lemma 7.2, we have <\u03c3ess (L) \u2264 \u2212\u03b8 < 0 with respect to\nspace B. On the other hand, eigenvalues of L with respect to B are necessarily eigenvalues\nwith respect to W 1,\u221e as well, hence, by Assumption 7.3, <\u03c3p (L) \u2264 \u2212\u03b8 < 0 with respect to\nB as well, and so\n(7.6)\n\n<\u03c3(L) \u2264 \u2212\u03b8 < 0\n\nwith respect to the space B.\nBy the spectral gap (7.6) and the fact that L as as second-order elliptic operator is\nsectorial, L by standard analytic semigroup theory [He] is linearly exponentially stable with\nrespect to B, i.e.,\nkeLt f k\u03b7 \u2264 e\u2212\u03b81 t kf k\u03b7\nTurning to the nonlinear equations, and noting that e\u03b7x is an exponentially growing weight,\nwe find as in [Sat] that nonlinear exponential stability follows as well, by a standard nonlinear iteration/variation of constants argument. We omit these straightforward details.\nTheorem 7.4 asserts that, similarly as for finite-dimensional ODE, exponential stability\nof steady-state solutions of the PDE (3.3) reduces to spectral properties of the linearized\noperator L: specifically, verification of Assumptions 5.1 and 7.3. This abstract result reduces\nthe study of PDE stability to the study of the eigenvalue equation for L, an ODE.\nRemark 7.5. The success of the weighted norm method relies on the property that the\nundamped mode p = p+ + p\u2212 is convected inward toward the boundary x = 0. Intuitively,\nwe may think of p to lowest order as p\u0303(x + \u03b1t) for a fixed profile p\u0303, so that\nsup e\u03b7x p = e\u2212\u03b7\u03b1t sup e\u03b7(x+\u03b1t) p\u0303(x + \u03b1t)\ndecays time-exponentially for \u03b7 > 0. More general situations may be treated by pointwise\nmethods as in [HZ, Z2], to obtain time-algebraic rather than exponential rates of decay.\n\n20\n\n\f8\n\nSpectral stability analysis\n\nTheorem 7.4 reduces the study of nonlinear stability to verification of spectral stability\nassumptions 5.1 and 7.3, the first a somewhat standard linear algebraic problem and the\nsecond a type of ordinary differential boundary-value problem arising frequently in the study\nof eigenvalues of differential operators.

By exponential convergence of \u016a (x) to U+ as x \u2192 \u221e, we have exponential convergence also of A(x, \u03bb) to\nA+ .\nBy Lemma 5.2 and Corollary 5.3, under Assumption 5.1, the stable subspace of A\nhas dimension three for <\u03bb \u2265 0, whence, by a standard lemma1 using the exponential\nconvergence of A to A+ , there exist choices of three independent solutions Wj+ , j = 4, 5, 6\nof (8.4) spanning the set of solutions that are decaying as x \u2192 +\u221e that are analytic as\nfunctions from x \u2192 W 1,\u221e [0, +\u221e). Likewise, one may easily construct analytic choices of\nthree independent solutions Wj0 , j = 1, 2, 3 of (8.4) satisfying the boundary conditions (7.2)\nat x = 0. Evidently, \u03bb is an eigenvalue, i.e., there exists a solution of (8.4) that is decaying\nas x \u2192 +\u221e and satisfies boundary-conditions (7.2) at x = 0, if and only if there is a linear\ndependency among W10 , W20 , W30 , W4+ , W5+ , W6+ .\nDefining the Evans function\n\n(8.8)\n\nE(\u03bb) := det(W10 , W20 , W30 , W4+ , W5+ , W6+ )|x=0 ,\n\nfollowing [AGJ, GZ, Z1], we thus have that the eigenvalues of L with respect to the weighted\nspace B on <\u03bb \u2265 0 correspond to the zeros of E. This can be efficiently computed numerically using the STABLAB package developed by J. Humpherys, based on algorithms of\n[BrZ, HuZ]. We refer the reader to [HuZ, HLyZ] for a discussion of theory and numerical\nprotocol, which is by now standard.2\n\n8.3\n\nHigh-frequency bound\n\nDefine \u03b4 := min{d, D}, \u03b1 = max |A(x)|, \u03b2 = max |B(x)|, A, B, C the coefficients of L, where\n|M | denotes the Euclidean matrix operator norm of a matrix M , i.e., the square root of the\nlargest eigenvalue of M T M .\nLemma 8.1. There exist no spectra of L with respect to B for <\u03bb + |=\u03bb| > \u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2 and\n\u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small.\n1\n2\n\nThe \"gap\" or \"conjugation\" lemma; see, e.g., [GZ, Z1, GMWZ].\nSee, e.g., [BHRZ, HLZ, CHNZ, HLyZ, BHZ, BLZ, BLeZ],\n\n22\n\n\fProof. First note that eigenvalues of L with respect to B are eigenvalues with respect to L2\nas well. Taking the real part of the L2 complex inner product of U with eigenvalue equation\n(8.9)\n\n\u03bbU = AUx + BU + CUxx ,\nR\nwe obtain after an integration by parts of term U \u2217 CU dx the inequality\n<\u03bbkU k2L2 \u2264 \u03b1kU k2L2 + \u03b2kU kL2 kUx kL2 \u2212 \u03b4kUx k2L2 .\n\nLikewise, taking the imaginary part yields |=\u03bb|kU k2L2 \u2264 \u03b1kU k2L2 . Summing, and using\nYoung's inquality, 2\u03b1ab \u2264 (\u03b12 /\u03b4)a2 + \u03b4b2 , yields\n(<\u03bb + |=\u03bb|)kU k2L2 \u2264 (\u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2)kU k2L2 ,\nyielding <\u03bb + |=\u03bb| \u2264 \u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2 whenever kU kL2 6= 0.\nThis establishes nonexistence of point spectra for <\u03bb+|=\u03bb| > \u03b12 /\u03b4 +\u03b2. Nonexistence of\nessential spectra follows by the same argument applied to the linearized eigenvalue equations\nabout the constant solution U \u2261 U+ together with the observation [He] that essential\nspectrum of L with respect to L2 is bounded on the left by the rightmost envelope of\nthe spectrum of the linearized operator about U \u2261 U+ , given by the solution set of the\ndispersion relation (5.3), and the fact that nonexistence of spectrum with respect to B is\nimplied by nonexistence of L2 spectrum provided \u03b7 > 0 is taken sufficiently small. (See the\nargument of Lemma 7.2.)\nRemark 8.2. The above energy estimate implies in passing that R\u0302 := \u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2 > R,\nwhere R is as in Lemma 5.6. To verify Assumption 5.1, therefore, it is sufficient to check\nthat the stable subspace of A+ has dimension three for \u03bb on imaginary interval [\u2212iR\u0302, iR\u0302].\n\n8.4\n\nNumerical stability computations\n\nFollowing a standard strategy introduced by Evans and Feroe [EF], we may now check by a\nsingle numerical winding number computation both of Assumptions 5.1 and 7.3. Specifically,\nwe compute the image under E of a semicircle S of radius R\u0302 := \u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2 (see Lemma 8.1\nfor definitions) in the unstable complex half-plane <\u03bb \u2265 0, with diameter [\u2212iR\u0302, iR\u0302] lying\nalong the imaginary axis.\nAs the code for approximating E in the course of the computation checks that the stable\nsubspace of A+ has dimension three, we obtain by Remark 8.2 a check of Assumption 5.1\nin the course of computing E on the diameter \u03bb \u2208 [\u2212iR\u0302, iR\u0302]. Assuming that Assumption\n5.1 is valid, we then obtain by Lemma 8.1 that there are no eigenvalues of E outside the\nsemicircle.\nMoreover, by the properties of the Evans function described in Section 8.2 (recall: also\ndependent on Assumption 5.1), eigenvalues of L within the semicircle S are exactly the\nzeros of the analytic function E. By the Principle of the Argument, the number of zeros\nwithin S is equal to the winding number of E(S), i.e., the number of times E(S) circles the\norigin in counterclockwise direction as \u03bb traverses S in counterclockwise direction. Thus,\nAssumption 7.3 corresponds to winding-number zero.\n23\n\n\f8.5\n\nResults\n\nFigure 4 displays the image of the semicircle S under the (analytic) Evans function E for\nthe typical profile \u016a displayed in Figure 3. We see clearly that the winding number is zero,\nindicating spectral stability, hence, by the results of Section 7, \u016a is nonlinearly stable. Here,\nd = .1, D = 1, \u03c9 = 1, \u03bd \u2212 = 1, f+\u2212 = 1, u+ = 1, \u03ba = 1, so that \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1.4343, and\n\u03b4 = .1, and R\u0302 = \u03b12 /\u03b4 + \u03b2 \u2248 11.43; the radius of S is taken as R\u0303 = 12 > R\u0302, following Lemma\n8.1. Though we did not carry out a systematic study over all parameter values and profiles,\nfor all profiles checked, we obtained results of zero winding number consistent with stability.\nRemark 8.3. Stability of \"small-amplitude\" steady states \u016a with max |\u016a \u2212U+ | sufficiently\nsmall, could in principle be determined by a study of stability of constant solutions, as\ndescribed in a more general setting in [GMWZ]. However, this does not seem particularly\ninteresting for applications, and so we do not attempt to carry out such an analysis here.\n\n9\n\nBehavior for general initial data\n\nThe results of Sections 7 and 8 indicate time-exponential stability of steady state solutions\n\u016a with respect to spatially-exponentially decaying initial perturbations. To put this another way, solutions with initial data converging exponentially as x \u2192 \u221e to U+ \u2208 E and\nsufficiently close to the profile \u016a , will converge as t \u2192 \u221e to \u016a .\nHowever, as we explore in this section, the actual stability properties appear to be\nconsiderably stronger. Namely, initial data converging as x \u2192 \u221e to any limiting value U\u221e\nappears to settle down rapidly to a steady state, determined by the total density p := p+ +p\u2212\nof the limiting state U\u221e . (Indeed, we suspect that only p need converge to a limiting value\nin order to determine the limiting steady state.)\nThe weighted norm methods used above do not appear sufficiently fine to establish this\nproperty, or at least we were not able to carry out such an analysis. An interesting open\nproblem would be to attempt to establish this result using the more detailed pointwise\nGreen function methods of [HZ, Z1].\n\n9.1\n\nNumerical time-evolution approximations\n\nIn this section, we describe the results of a numerical time-evolution study, that is, the\nevolution in time of given initial data under equation (3.1). This was carried out via\nMATLABs Finite Element Method (FEM) routines, with Neumann boundary conditions\nat a boundary x = 50 far from the computational domain of interest. For reference, see the\nhelpful notes [H].\nIn Fig. 5, we have displayed graphs of variables p+ , p\u2212 , and c taken at successive time\n\u2212\nintervals, with boundary data p+\n0 , p0 , and c0 at x = 0 fixed at the same values .2, .2, .2\nused in the computations used to obtain the steady-state solution from Fig. 3, and step\ninitial data consisting of .2, .2, .2 for x \u2208 [0, 3] and 0, 0, 0 elsewhere.

In Fig. 6, we have\nsuperimposed onto Fig. 5 the steady-state profiles that were displayed in Fig. 3, computed\nas solutions of a two-point ordinary differential boundary problem, showing a nearly exact\ncorrespondence between the apparent limit of the time-evolution PDE solution and the\ntheoretical steady state ODE solution computed by completely different methods.\nThis is strong evidence for the accuracy of both computations, and also for stability\n25\n\n\fof the steady-state solution as computed by yet a third different method in our numerical\nEvans function computations.\np+(x,t)\n0.03\n0.025\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\np\u2212(x,t)\n0.025\n0.02\n0.015\n0.01\n0.005\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\nc(x,t)\n0.02\n\n0.015\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFigure 5: Time evolution of typical data.\n\n9.2\n\nSelection of limiting profile\n\nThe intuitive explanation for the behavior described in the previous subsection is that only\nthe special mode p := p+ + p\u2212 is \"undamped\", with other modes decaying exponentially\ntoward their equilibrium values; see the discussion in Section 4 of stability of constant\nsolutions. Thus, even if the limiting value U\u221e of the initial data is not on the equilibrium\ncurve E, it will rapidly adjust dynamically toward a value U+ inf E with the same total\ndensity p.\nThis is why the data from Fig. 5 converges toward a zero endstate profile. In Fig. 7,\nwe show the results of a similar experiment with the same boundary data and the same\ninitial data for p\u00b1 , but c initially constant and equal to .02; as predicted by theoretical\nconsiderations, we see convergence to an identical zero endstate profile. In Fig. 8, we\ndisplay the results for initial data c \u2261 .02 and p initially zero as x \u2192 +\u221e, but p\u00b1 nonzero\nas x \u2192 +\u221e (to do this, we assign p\u2212 a nonphysical negative value, but mathematically this\nstill makes sense).\nFurther confirmation is given by Fig. 9, in which we display behavior for initial data\nconverging to nonzero value of p; again, the agreement with prediction is exact.\n\n26\n\n\fp+(x,t)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\np\u2212(x,t)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\nc(x,t)\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nDistance\n\nFigure 6: Comparison with steady state profile.\n\n10\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have applied new mathematical tools to the question of how microtubule dynamic\nproperties contribute to microtubule array construction. Our results show the complex\nnature of the predicted end-states for a relatively simple model of microtubule dynamics\nincluding nucleation rate and tubulin concentration. We emphasize that the mathematical\ntools introduced to handle he evident stochastic processes here are of general application,\nand should find use in related situations. Originally developed to study stability of shock and\nboundary layers in gas dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and viscoelasticity (See [BHRZ,\nHLZ, CHNZ, HLyZ, BHZ, BLZ, BLeZ]), these methods are capable of handling systems of\nessentially arbitrary complexity. It is our hope that these methods and their application\nwill open the way to the study of more complicated and realistic Biological models. We\nview the present study mainly as a feasibility study for the application of new mathematical\ntools transferring technology originating in the study of continuum mechanics to the area\nof biological modeling.\nAn important further direction from both Mathematical and Biological point of view\nis the study of the singular perturbation limit as d \u2192 0. In our numerics, we have mostly\ninvestigated the nonphysical case d \u223c D conducive to good numerical conditioning, whereas\nd << D in applications.

This should in principle be possible using the same body of techniques applied\nhere; see [Z1] for an analysis in a similar spirit. As discussed at the beginning of Section 9,\nanother very interesting open problem would be to establish stability of steady state profiles\nwith respect to perturbations decaying exponentially only in the total density p and not in\nother modes. This should be accessible by the techniques of [HZ, Z1].\n\nReferences\n[AGJ]\n\nJ. Alexander, R. Gardner, and C.K.R.T. Jones, A topological invariant arising\nin the analysis of traveling waves. J.

Otherwise, numerics will be destroyed when we\ntry to go into the physical parameter range d << 1, for one thing. For another, there is an\nadvantage to singular limits, in that they tend to reduce to problem to composite problems\n32\n\n\fthat are sometimes explicitly solvable. Finally, d is often set to zero in applications, and\nit is important to justify that this approximation is valid. In this appendix, we initiate\nthe discussion by a singular perturbation study of the profile existence problem. A parallel\nstudy of the stability problem should be carried out, but appears to be more difficult.\nFirst observe, if d = 0, then the number of boundary conditions should be only two at\nthe boundary x = 0: one for c, which satisfies a parabolic equation, and one for the single\nincoming mode among hyperbolic p\u00b1 . So, we have too many boundary conditions for the\nslow problem d = 0.\nWe may conclude from this that there is a \"true\" (i.e., in general nonconstant) boundary\nlayer of thickness \u223c d matching full parabolic to hyperbolic\u2013parabolic boundary conditions.\nThis satisfies the \"fast\" problem obtained by rescaling x \u2192 x\u0303 := x/d, and involves second\nand first-order derivs. but not zero-order terms. That is, the p\u00b1 equations become in x\u0303\ncoordinates, setting d = 0, just\n+ +\np+\nxx = (\u03bd p )x ,\n\n\u2212 \u2212\np\u2212\nxx = \u2212(\u03bd p )x ,\n\na pair of conservation laws, and constant-coefficient as well. Integrating up, we get\n+ +\n+\np+\nx = \u03bd (p \u2212 p (+\u221e)),\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\np\u2212\nx = \u2212\u03bd (P \u2212 \u2212p (+\u221e)),\n\nfrom which we find p+ \u2261 constant, but p\u2212 (+\u221e) is arbitrary, with an exponentially decaying\nsolution. The c equation degenerates on the other hand to c \u2261 constant.\nSo, the correct boundary data for the slow problem are p+ (0) prescribed (from original\nboundary conditions), c prescribed (from original boundary conditions, either Dirichlet or\nNeumann type preserved).\nThen we solve the slow problem obtained by setting d = 0 in the original coordinates:\n(B.1)\n\n(B.2)\n\n(B.3)\n\n0=\u2212\n\n\u2202(\u03bd + p+ (x, t))\n\u2212 f+\u2212 p+ (x, t) + f\u2212+ p\u2212 (x, t)\n\u2202x\n\n0 = \u03bd\u2212\n\n\u2202p\u2212 (x, t)\n+ f+\u2212 p+ (x, t) \u2212 f\u2212+ p\u2212 (x, t)\n\u2202x\n\n0 = \u2212kc(x, t) + \u03bd \u2212 p\u2212 (x, t) \u2212 \u03bd + p+ (x, t) + D\n\n\u2202 2 c(x, t)\n.\n\u2202x2\n\nObserving (by addition of the first two equations) that\n\u03bd + p+ \u2212 \u03bd \u2212 p\u2212 \u2261 \u03b1,\n\n(B.4)\n\n\u03b1 constant, we may rewrite these equations after some rearrangement as\nf+\u2212 \u0011 + +\n\u03c9c\u03b1\n(\u03bd p )x =\n\u2212\n(\u03bd p ) \u2212 \u2212\n\u03bd \u2212 u+ c\n\u03bd\n\u0010\n\u03b1\u0011\n\u03b1\u0011\nk\u0010\nc+\n=\nc+\n.\nk xx D\nk\n+ +\n\n(B.5)\n\n\u0010 \u03c9c\n\n33\n\n\ftogether with (B.4). Note that (B.4) already selects the value p\u2212 (0) as a function of p+ (0)\nand c(0), in principle determining completely the solution with no further computation,\nprovided one exists. The rest of the analysis consists in verifying that (B.4) is indeed\nconsistent with existence.\nThe second, constant-coefficient equation together with the requirement that c be bounded\nas x \u2192 +\u221e may be exactly solved as\n\u221a\nc(x) + \u03b1/k = e\u2212x k/D (c(0) + \u03b1/k),\n\u03b1 arbitrary, since only the exponentially decaying mode is allowable. In particular, we find\nthat\nc(+\u221e) = \u2212\u03b1/k.\n\u0010 \u03c9c2 u+ \u2212f \u2212 \u03bd \u0011\n+ \u2212\nof (\u03bd + p+ ) in the first equation is\nFrom (4.4), we find that the coefficient\n\u03bd \u2212 u+ c\n(B.6)\n\nnegative as x \u2192 +\u221e, so the stable manifold has a mode in direction p+ .\nNote that, by this observation, the dimension of the phase space for the slow problem\nis four, while the dimension of the stable manifold about a rest state is two (one decaying\ndirection for c, and one decaying direction for p+ ) and the dimension of the manifold of\nsolutions satisfying the (two) initial conditions is three (two free parameters plus direction\nof spatial evolution). Thus, as for the full problem, the dimension of the intersection is\ngenerically a union of finitely many curves/steady state solutions; in particular, we expect\na connection to each possible endstate.\nWe now investigate in detail the possible solutions. There are two cases.\nCase I. (c(+\u221e) = 0) In this case, also \u03b1 = 0 by (B.6), whence p\u2212 (+\u221e)\n= 0 by (B.4)\n\u221a\n\u2212x k/D\n+\n+\nand \u03bd (+\u221e) = u c(+\u221e) = 0. Noting that in this case c(x) = e\nc(0), we may\nrewrite the first equation of (B.5) as\nr \u0011\nf+\u2212\n1 \u0010 \u03c9c\nk +\n+\npx = + \u2212 \u2212 + +\np\nu \u03bd\nu c\nD\nto see that also p+ \u2192 0 as x \u2192 +\u221e, as the solution of a homogeneous first-order scalar\nequation with\u221anegative coefficient near +\u221e. Moreover, (p+ , p\u2212 ) go to zero superexponen\u2212x\n\nk/D\n\n, while c goes to zero only exponentially. Such a slow solution exists for\ntially, as ee\n+\nany initial data p (0), c+ (0), hence a corresponding matched boundary-layer solution exists\nfor any Dirichlet data p+ (0), p\u2212 (0), c+ (0).\nNeumann data: in this case, the only bounded solution of the c equation satisfying the\nboundary conditions seems to be the trivial solution c \u2261 0, from which (B.4) gives p\u2212 \u2261 0.\nBut then (B.1) yields p+ \u2261 0 as well, i.e., only the trivial solution is possible, and we cannot\ngenerate a slow solution of this type for general initial data.\nCase II. (c(+\u221e) > 0) Again, only the decaying mode of (c + \u03b1/k) is possible, so that\nthe limit as x \u2192 +\u221e of c is c(+\u221e) = \u2212\u03b1/k, or\n\u03b1 = \u2212kc(+\u221e) < 0.\n34\n\n\fFrom (B.4), we obtain then p\u2212 (+\u221e) = (c/\u03bd \u2212 )(u+ p+ (+\u221e) + k), and the first equation of\n2\n. Solving for p\u2212 (+\u221e) using\n(B.5) yields at +\u221e the equilibrium condition p+ = \u03bd \u2212 f \u2212\u03c9kc\n\u2212u+ \u03c9c2\n+\n\n(B.4), we obtain the full conditions for E, as we should. Likewise, by similar computations\nas above, we obtain a solution for each initial data and endstate.\n(Note: this is not a \"generic\" result as in the general case. In other words, the assumption d \u2192 0 precludes nongeneric behavior.)\nNeumann data: Again, the only bounded solution of the c equation satisfying the boundary conditions is the trivial solution c \u2261 \u2212\u03b1/k, greatly simplifying the analysis. From (B.4),\nwe obtain then p\u2212 = (c/\u03bd \u2212 )(u+ p+ + k), and the first equation of (B.5) becomes\np+\nx =\n\n\u0010 \u03c9c2 u+ \u2212 f \u2212 \u03bd \u0011\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u03bd u c\n\nyielding at +\u221e the equilibrium condition p+ =\n\np+ +\n\n\u03c9ck\n,\n\u03bd \u2212 u+\n\n\u03c9kc2\n.\n\u2212\n\u03bd \u2212 f+\n\u2212u+ \u03c9c2\n\nSolving for p\u2212 (+\u221e) using\n\n(B.4), we obtain the full conditions for E, as we should. Assuming (4.4), we again obtain\na connection for each endstate in E, as expected. So, this case appears to permit profiles,\nalso for Neumann data.\nRemarks B.1. 1. Neumann boundary conditions do not seem consistent in case \u03b1 = 0\ncorresponding to c+ = 0. Thus, this solution may (for Neumann conditions) be expected\nto disappear in the singular limit d \u2192 0.\n2. At a heuristic level, one could just drop one boundary condition and set d = 0,\nit appears, without much difference in profile behavior. However, for stability studies one\nshould not neglect the fast (inner layer) dynamics near the boundary.\nIn principle, stability should likewise be determinable from the singular perturbation\nstructure in the limit as d \u2192 0, similarly as in [Z1]. However, we do not attempt to carry\nthis out here. Some such analysis should be carried out in justification of the approximation\nd = 0 commonly used in practice.\n\n35\n\n\f"}
