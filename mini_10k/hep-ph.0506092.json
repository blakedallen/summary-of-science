[1] that\nthe recent result by the STAR collaboration at\nRHIC [2] provides information on the pion velocity\nnear the chiral phase transition in hot medium\nwith the conclusion that the pions seen in Hanbury\nBrown-Twist interferometry are emitted from a\nchiral-symmetry restored phase [3]. In this note,\nwe wish to interpret the result of the analysis by\nCramer et al. in terms of the vector manifestation\nscenario of hidden local symmetry theory [4, 5].\nThe effective field theory based on the hidden\nlocal symmetry (HLS), which includes both pions\nand vector mesons as the dynamical degrees of\nfreedom, implemented with the Wilsonian matching to determine the bare theory from the underlying QCD, leads to the vector manifestation (VM)\n\nof chiral symmetry [4, 5] in which the massless vector meson becomes the chiral partner of the pion\nat the critical point #1 . This picture provides a\nstrong support for Brown-Rho scaling [6] which\npredicted that the mass of light-quark hadrons\nshould drop in proportion to the quark condensate hq\u0304qi. By now there are several experimental indications that this scenario is a viable one.\nThe earliest one was the enhancement of dielectron mass spectra below the \u03c1/\u03c9 resonance observed at CERN SPS [7] which has been satisfactorily explained by the dropping of the \u03c1 meson\nmass [8] according to the Brown-Rho scaling [6].\nThis explanation however is not unique as there\nare alternative \u2013 but not necessarily unrelated \u2013\nmechanisms that can equally well describe the\npresently available data [9]. A much more compelling evidence comes from the mass shift of the\n\u03c9 meson in nuclei measured by the KEK-PS E325\nExperiment [10] and the CBELSA/TAPS Collaboration [11], and also from that of the \u03c1 meson\nobserved in the STAR experiment [12]. These are\nclean signals manifested in a \"pristine\" environment unencumbered by a plethora of \"trivial\" effects.\nIn this note, we focus on the pion velocity\nnear the critical temperature and make a prediction based on the vector manifestation (VM).\nThe pion velocity is one of the important observable quantities in heavy-ion collisions as it controls the pion propagation in medium through\na dispersion relation. Our prediction for v\u03c0 is\nv\u03c0 (Tc ) = 0.83 \u2212 0.99, which we should stress, is at\n\n\u2217\nContribution to the proceedings of the YITP workshop\non Non-equilibrium dynamics in the QCD phase transitions, February 22 - 24, 2005, YITP, Kyoto, Japan.\n\n#1\nAs studied in Ref. [5] in detail, the VM is defined only\nas a limit with bare parameters approaching the VM fixed\npoint from the broken phase.\n\nWe study the pion velocity near the critical temperature Tc of chiral symmetry restoration in\nQCD. Using chiral perturbation theory based on\nhidden local symmetry (HLS) as an effective field\ntheory, where the chiral symmetry restoration is\nrealized as the vector manifestation (VM), we\nshow that the pion velocity for T \u2192 Tc is close\nto the speed of light, v\u03c0 (T ) = 0.83 \u2212 0.99 which\nis at variance with the sigma model result which\npredicts v\u03c0 (Tc ) = 0. Our prediction on v\u03c0 (Tc ) is\ncompared with the value extracted from the recent\nRHIC data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\n\fand the covariant derivative of \u03beR is obtained by\nthe replacement of L\u03bc with R\u03bc in the above where\nV\u03bc is the gauge field of Hlocal , and L\u03bc and R\u03bc are\nthe external gauge fields introduced by gauging\nGglobal symmetry. In terms of L\u03bc and R\u03bc , we\ndefine the external axial-vector and vector fields\nas A\u03bc = (R\u03bc \u2212 L\u03bc )/2 and V\u03bc = (R\u03bc + L\u03bc )/2.\nIn the HLS theory it is possible to perform the\nderivative expansion systematically [18, 19, 20, 5].\nIn the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) with\nHLS, the vector meson mass is to be considered as\nsmall compared with the chiral symmetry breaking scale \u039b\u03c7 , by assigning O(p) to the HLS gauge\ncoupling, g \u223c O(p) [18, 19]. (For details of the\nChPT with HLS, see Ref. [5].) The leading order Lagrangian with Lorentz non-invariance can\nbe written as [15]\n\nstrong variance with the result obtained in sigma\nmodels #2 , i.e., v\u03c0 (Tc ) = 0 [13]. We believe our result to be consistent with v\u03c0 (T ) = 0.65 of Cramer\net al. [1] extracted from the recent STAR data [2].\nWhat distinguishes our approach from that of\nsigma models is the intrinsic temperature and/or\ndensity dependence of the parameters of the HLS\nLagrangian, that results from integrating out the\nhigh energy modes (i.e., the quarks and gluons\nabove the matching scale) in medium [14, 15]. It\nis this intrinsic temperature and/or density dependence \u2013 which causes Lorentz symmetry breaking\n\u2013 that plays the essential role for realizing the chiral symmetry restoration in a consistent way and\nunderlies the Brown-Rho scaling.\n\n2\n\nVector manifestation of chiral\nsymmetry\n\nL=\n\nIn this section, we start with the HLS Lagrangian\nat leading order including the effects of Lorentz\nnon-invariance. Then we present the conditions\nsatisfied at the critical point.\nThe HLS theory is based on the Gglobal \u00d7 Hlocal\nsymmetry, where G = SU (Nf )L \u00d7 SU (Nf )R is\nthe chiral symmetry and H = SU (Nf )V is the\nHLS. The basic quantities are the HLS gauge boson V\u03bc and two matrix valued variables \u03beL (x) and\n\u2032 (x) =\n\u03beR (x) which transform as \u03beL,R (x) \u2192 \u03beL,R\n\n+\n\n(F\u03c0t )2 u\u03bc u\u03bd\n\n\u0014\n\n+ \u2212\n\n+\n\nF\u03c0t F\u03c0s (g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd )\n\n+\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u00d7tr \u03b1\u0302\u03bck \u03b1\u0302\u03bdk\n\nF\u03c3t F\u03c3s (g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd )\n\nh\n\n\u00d7tr V \u03bc\u03bd V \u03b1\u03b2\nwhere\n\u03b1\u0302\u03bc\u22a5,k =\n\n\u0015\n\n1\nu\u03bc u\u03b1 g\u03bd\u03b2\ngL2\n1\n\u2212 2 (g\u03bc\u03b1 g\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 2u\u03bc u\u03b1 g\u03bd\u03b2 )\n2gT\n\nwhere h(x) \u2208 Hlocal and gL,R \u2208\n[SU (Nf )L,R ]global . These variables are parametert\nt\nized as #3 \u03beL,R (x) = ei\u03c3(x)/F\u03c3 e\u2213i\u03c0(x)/F\u03c0 , where \u03c0 =\n\u03c0 a Ta denotes the pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone\n(NG) bosons associated with the spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of Gglobal chiral symmetry,\nand \u03c3 = \u03c3 a Ta denotes the NG bosons associated\nwith the spontaneous breaking of Hlocal . This \u03c3 is\nabsorbed into the HLS gauge boson through the\nHiggs mechanism, and then the vector meson acquires its mass. F\u03c0t and F\u03c3t denote the temporal\ncomponents of the decay constant of \u03c0 and \u03c3, respectively. The covariant derivative of \u03beL is given\nby\n\n\u0015\n\n\u00d7tr \u03b1\u0302\u03bc\u22a5 \u03b1\u0302\u22a5\n\n\u03bd\u0003\n\n\u0002\n\n(F\u03c3t )2 u\u03bc u\u03bd\n\n\"\n\n\u2020\nh(x)\u03beL,R (x)gL,R\n,\n\nD\u03bc \u03beL = \u2202\u03bc \u03beL \u2212 iV\u03bc \u03beL + i\u03beL L\u03bc ,\n\n\u0014\n\ni\n\n,\n\n1 \u03bc\n\u2020\n[D \u03beR * \u03beR\n\u2213 D \u03bc \u03beL * \u03beL\u2020 ].\n2i\n\n#\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere F\u03c0s denote the spatial pion decay constant\nand similarly F\u03c3s for the \u03c3. The rest frame of\nthe medium is specified by u\u03bc = (1, ~0) and V\u03bc\u03bd\nis the field strength of V\u03bc . gL and gT correspond\nin medium to the HLS gauge coupling g. The\nparametric \u03c0 and \u03c3 velocities are defined by [21]\nV\u03c02 = F\u03c0s /F\u03c0t ,\n\nV\u03c32 = F\u03c3s /F\u03c3t .\n\n(4)\n\nNow we approach the critical point of chiral\nsymmetry restoration, which is characterized by\nthe equality between the axial-vector and vector\ncurrent correlators in QCD, GA \u2212 GV \u2192 0 for\nT \u2192 Tc . This should hold even in the EFT\nside. In Ref. [15], it was shown that they are\nsatisfied for any values of p0 and p\u0304 around the\nmatching scale only if the following conditions are\nmet: (gL,bare , gT,bare , atbare , asbare ) \u2192 (0, 0, 1, 1) for\n\n(1)\n\n#2\nBy sigma models, we mean generically the chiral symmetry models that contain pions as the only relevant longwavelength degrees of freedom.\n#3\nThe wave function renormalization constant of the pion\nfield is given by the temporal component of the pion decay\nconstant [16, 17]. Thus we normalize \u03c0 and \u03c3 by F\u03c0t and\nF\u03c3t respectively.\n\n2\n\n\fin the low temperature region. From these conditions, we obtain the following matching condition\nto determine the deviation of the bare pion velocity from the speed of light in the low temperature\nregion:\n\nT \u2192 Tc . This implies that at the bare level the\nlongitudinal mode of the vector meson becomes\nthe real NG boson and couples to the vector current correlator, while the transverse mode decouples. As shown in Ref. [16], (gL , at , as ) = (0, 1, 1)\nis a fixed point of the RGEs and satisfied at any\nenergy scale. Thus the VM condition is given by\n(gL , at , as ) \u2192 (0, 1, 1)\n\nfor T \u2192 Tc .\n\n2\n\u03b4bare \u2261 1 \u2212 V\u03c0,bare\n=\n\n(5)\n\nThe vector meson mass is never generated at the\ncritical temperature since the quantum correction\nto M\u03c12 is proportional to gL2 . Because of gL \u2192 0,\nthe transverse vector meson at the critical point,\nat any energy scale, decouples from the vector current correlator. The VM condition for at and as\nleads to the equality between the \u03c0 and \u03c3 (i.e.,\nlongitudinal vector meson) velocities:\nT \u2192T\n\n(V\u03c0 /V\u03c3 )4 = (F\u03c0s F\u03c3t /F\u03c3s F\u03c0t )2 = at /as \u2192 c 1. (6)\nThis can be easily understood from the point of\nview of the VM since the longitudinal vector meson becomes the chiral partner of pion. We note\nthat this condition V\u03c3 = V\u03c0 holds independently\nof the value of the bare pion velocity which is to\nbe determined through the Wilsonian matching.\n\n3\n\nPion velocity near the critical\ntemperature\n\nOne possible way to determine the bare parameters is the Wilsonian matching which is done by\nmatching the axial-vector and vector current correlators derived from the HLS with those by the\noperator product expansion (OPE) in QCD at the\nmatching scale \u039b [20]. The Wilsonian matching\nleads to the following conditions on the bare pion\ndecay constants [22]:\nt\ns\nF\u03c0,bare\nF\u03c0,bare\n1 \u0010\n\u03b1s \u0011\n=\n1\n+\n\u039b2\n8\u03c0 2\n\u03c0\n\n\"\n\n2\n2\u03c0 2 h \u03b1\u03c0s G2 iT\n3 1408 \u03b1s hq\u0304qiT\n+\n\u03c0\n+\n3\n\u039b4\n27\n\u039b6\n\n#\n\n1 32 4 T 6 \u03c0\n\u03c0\nA .\nG0 105 \u039b6 4\n\n(8)\n\nThis implies that the intrinsic temperature dependence starts from the O(T 6 ) contribution.\nAs is discussed in Ref. [22], we should in principle evaluate the matrix elements in terms of QCD\nvariables only in order for performing the Wilsonian matching, which is as yet unavailable from\nmodel-independent QCD calculations. Therefore,\nwe make an estimation by extending the dilute gas\napproximation adopted in the QCD sum rule analysis in low temperature region to the critical temperature including all the light degrees of freedom\nexpected in the VM. In the HLS/VM theory, both\nthe longitudinal and transverse vector mesons become massless at the critical temperature. At the\ncritical point, the longitudinal vector meson couples to the vector current whereas the transverse\nvector mesons decouple from the theory. Thus we\nassume that thermal fluctuations of the system\nare dominated near Tc not only by the pions but\nalso by the longitudinal vector mesons. We evaluate the thermal matrix elements of the non-scalar\noperators in the OPE, by extending the thermal\npion gas approximation employed in Ref. [23] to\nthe longitudinal vector mesons that figure in our\napproach.\nThis is feasible since at the critical temperature,\nwe expect the equality A\u03c14 (Tc ) = A\u03c04 (Tc ) to hold\nas the massless longitudinal vector meson is the\nchiral partner of the pion in the VM. It should be\nnoted that, although we use the dilute gas approximation, the treatment here is already beyond the\nlow-temperature approximation because the contribution from vector meson is negligible in the\nlow-temperature region. Since we treat the pion\nas a massless particle in the present analysis, it\nis reasonable to take A\u03c04 (T ) \u2243 A\u03c04 (T = 0).

Let us make a\nrough estimate of \u03b4bare . For the range of matching scale (\u039b = 0.8 \u2212 1.1 GeV), that of QCD scale\n(\u039bQCD = 0.30 \u2212 0.45 GeV) and critical temperature (Tc = 0.15 \u2212 0.20 GeV), we get\n\u03b4bare (Tc ) = 0.0061 \u2212 0.29 .\n\nthanks to the non-renormalization property, i.e.,\nv\u03c0 (Tc ) = V\u03c0,bare (Tc ) given in Eq. (13), we arrive\nat the physical pion velocity at the chiral restoration:\nv\u03c0 (Tc ) = 0.83 \u2212 0.99 ,\nclose to the speed of light.\n\n(11)\n\n4\n\nThus we obtain the bare pion velocity as\nV\u03c0,bare (Tc ) = 0.83 \u2212 0.99 .\nWe next consider the quantum and hadronic\nthermal corrections to the parametric pion velocity. It was proven in Ref. [16] that the pion velocity is protected from renormalization by the VM.\nIn the following, we show that this can be understood in terms of chiral partners: Away from Tc ,\nthe pion velocity receives hadronic thermal correction of the form [24]:\nv\u03c02 (T ) \u2243 V\u03c02 \u2212 Nf\nfor\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the contribution of the massive \u03c3 (i.e., the\nlongitudinal mode of massive vector meson) is\nsuppressed by the Boltzmann factor exp[\u2212M\u03c1 /T ],\nand then only the pion loop contributes to the pion\nvelocity. On the other hand, when we approach\nthe critical temperature, the vector meson mass\ngoes to zero due to the VM. Thus exp[\u2212M\u03c1 /T ] is\nno longer the suppression factor. As a result, the\nhadronic correction in the pion velocity is absent\ndue to the exact cancelation between the contribution of pion and that of its chiral partner \u03c3.\nSimilarly the quantum correction generated from\nthe pion loop is exactly canceled by that from the\n\u03c3 loop. Accordingly we conclude\nv\u03c0 (T ) = V\u03c0,bare (T )\n\nfor\n\nT \u2192 Tc ,\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this note, we studied, using the ChPT with\nHLS/VM, the pion velocity near the critical temperature. We exploited the non-renormalization\nproperty of the pion velocity to assure that it\nsuffices to compute the bare pion velocity at the\nmatching scale to arrive at the physical pion velocity at the chiral restoration temperature. We\nderived the matching condition on the bare pion\nvelocity and found that the pion velocity near Tc is\n(VM)\nclose to the speed of light, v\u03c0\n(T ) = 0.83 \u2212 0.99\nand definitely far from the zero velocity. This is\nin a stark contrast to the result obtained from the\nchiral theory [13], wherein only the pion figures\nas the relevant degree of freedom near Tc , namely,\nv\u03c0 (Tc ) = 0. The drastic difference between the\ntwo approaches is not difficult to understand. In\nthe HLS/VM approach, the \u03c1 meson becomes light\nas Tc is approached from below and plays as important a role as the pion does. The effect of the\nmassless vector meson cannot be approximated in\nchiral models by local operators in pseudoscalar\nfields.\nBy fitting the pion spectra observed by STAR at\nRHIC in terms of an optical potential that incorporates the dispersion relation of low-energy pions\nin nuclear matter, Cramer et al. deduced the inmedium pion velocity v\u03c0 (T ) = 0.65. The authors\ninterpreted this result as an evidence for the pions\nbeing emitted from the chiral-symmetry restored\nphase. No error bars have been assigned to this\nvalue, so it is difficult to make a clear-cut assessment of what that value implies. It seems however difficult to identify it with what has been predicted by sigma models, namely, v\u03c0 = 0. On the\nother hand, given that our prediction (14) based\non HLS/VM is for the chiral limit, it seems reasonable to expect that the account of the explicit\nchiral symmetry breaking by quark masses would\nlower the velocity from (14), making it closer to\nthe observed value, v\u03c0 = 0.65. Whether or not it\nsignals the chirally restored phase as interpreted in\n[1, 3] is not clear. However as argued in [25], there\n\nT4\n2\u03c0 2\n15 (F\u03c0t )2 M\u03c12\n\nT < Tc ,\n\n(14)\n\n(13)\n\ni.e., the pion velocity in the limit T \u2192 Tc receives neither hadronic nor quantum corrections\ndue to the protection by the VM. This implies that\n(gL , at , as , V\u03c0 ) = (0, 1, 1, any) forms a fixed line for\nfour RGEs of gL , at , as and V\u03c0 . When a point on\nthis fixed line is selected through the matching\nprocedure as explained in Ref. [22], that is to say\nwhen the value of V\u03c0,bare is fixed, the present result implies that the point does not move in a subspace of the parameters. Approaching the chiral\nsymmetry restoration point, the physical pion velocity itself will flow into the fixed point. Finally\n4\n\n\fis an indication for a massless pion (in the same [12] E. V. Shuryak and G. E. Brown, Nucl. Phys.\nmultplet with a scalar \u03c3) just above Tc with its veA 717, 322 (2003).\nlocity close to 1, it seems logical that v\u03c0 stays near\n1 \u2013 rather than near zero \u2013 as Tc is approached [13] D.
