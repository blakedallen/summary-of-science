Introduction\nThe race for the discovery of new superconductors got a boost in early 1986 with\ninvention of cuprate high Tc superconductors (HTSc) [1]. Further, when the momentum was a bit\nslowed down, in year 2002 the discovery of MgB2 [2] steamed the race once again. More\nrecently, the scientists are once again puzzled with the invention of pnictide superconductors [3].\nInterestingly, before cuprates [1], the superconductivity for over 75 years was mostly confined to\nthe electron-phonon mediated interactions [4]. On materials science front itself, most of exotic\nsuperconductors have appeared only after the discovery of cuprates [1]. In fact after discovery of\nsuperconductivity in Cuprates [1] and Fe based pnictides [3], one wonders as if, still more\nsurprises are yet to come from periodic table.\nIn this short communication, we focus on an inter-metallic superconducting compound\ni.e., NbC, on which there are only few scant reports [5-9] in literature. Our interest on this\ncompound is two fold, first though it was discovered long back in 1964 itself [5], the same is yet\nleast studied superconductor. Second, the solid state chemistry of different allotropes of Carbon\nin any crystalline compound had been of immense interest in last couple of decades not only for\nchemists but to physicists as well. Couple of examples in this regards are Fullerenes [10], Carbon\nNano Tubes (CNT) [11,] and Graphene [12]. We synthesized the intermetallic Nb based Carbide\nNbC compound via a simple vacuum encapsulation technique. The vacuum encapsulation\ntechnique based high temperature synthesis of compounds recently gained popularity after\ndiscovery of Fe based pnictide superconductors. The superconducting critical temperatures of\nsuperconducting intermetallic compounds can be empirically related to parameters such as\ncrystal structure, composition, free electron concentration, and lattice parameter [6-8]. It is\ndifficult to synthesis NbC because transition metal react at high temperature. Niobium Carbide is\na refractory ceramic with a high melting point (3600\u00b0C), excellent mechanical properties, and\nlow electrical resistance [5]. Additionally, NaCl-type transition metal carbides MC (M =V, Ti,\nNb, Ta, Hf and Zr) are of fundamental importance in solid-state science and technology [5-9].\nSome researchers have reported the unit-cell parameter and crystal structure of these Carbides [6,\n8]. Seemingly, the cell parameters and Carbon content in NbC play deciding role in deterring the\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) [6]. Actually the lattice parameter depends upon the\nC content of the NbC system as it possesses wide region of homogeneity (from NbC1.00 to\n2\n\n\fNbC0.72) [13, 14]. The disordered state of the non-stoichiometric NbCx has B1 structure. Neutron\ndiffraction studies showed that with the C content of 0.81 to 0.88 ordered phases of M6C5-type\nare formed in NbC system [13]. Furthermore, the atomic displacement parameters of the\nCarbides have rarely been reported. Cubic NbC is a superconductor below 12 K [5-9]. In other\nwords,\n\ninnovative\n\napproaches\n\nare\n\nneeded\n\nto\n\nsynthesize\n\nNbC\n\nwith\n\ncontrolled\n\nmicrostructures/defects so that enhanced superconducting properties, reduced electrical\nresistivity in the normal state at low temperatures, and improved mechanical strengths can be\naccomplished. From a technological point of view, this material is interesting, because of its\npossible application to induce superconductivity in Carbon nanotube junctions [9]. Here we\nreport the synthesis temperature optimization and host of superconducting properties for the\nstoichiometric NbC. We optimized the synthesis temperature for NbC and achieved a single\nphase compound without any detectable impurity within the resolution limit of X-ray powder\ndiffraction. The resultant compound is superconducting at 11.5 K.\n\nII. Experimental\nAll the studied polycrystalline NbC samples were prepared through single step solid-state\nreaction route via vacuum encapsulation technique. High purity (~99.8%) Nb, and nano-C in\ntheir stoichiometric amount were weighed, mixed and ground thoroughly using mortar and\npestle. The mixed powders were palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-4 Torr) in a quartz tube. These\nsealed quartz ampoules were placed in box furnace and heat treated at (a) 1150oC for 24 hours,\n(b) 1200oC for 24 hours and (c) at 1250oC for 24 hours each. Finally furnace was allowed to cool\ndown to room temperature naturally. The crystal structure was analyzed by the powder X-ray\ndiffraction patterns at room temperature using Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K radiation.\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample (synthesized at 1250\u00b0C) was\ntaken on a ZEISS-EVO MA-10 scanning electron microscope. The magnetic (DC and AC\nmagnetization) measurements are carried out on the physical property measurement system\n(PPMS-14T) from Quantum Design-USA.\n\nIII. Results and discussions\nFigure 1 shows the room temperature XRD patterns of various NbC samples being\nsynthesized at different temperatures. The XRD patterns of 1150\u00b0C, 1200\u00b0C and 1250\u00b0C\n3\n\n\fprocessed samples are shown one over the other in Fig. 1. The XRD data are fitted using\nRietveld refinement (FullProf Version). It is clear that samples are phase pure and crystallized in\ncubic structure with space group Fm-3m. Coordinate positions for the atoms are Nb: 1a (0, 0, 0),\nand C: 1b (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). We observed that with an increase in sintering temperature from 1150\n\u00b0C to 1250\u00b0C, the lattice parameter is increased monotonically from 4.468 \u00c5 to 4.471 \u00c5, see\nTable 1. For further higher temperature synthesized samples, the increase in lattice parameter\nwas not observed; also the phase purity of the compound also gets compromised. Hence we show\nthe XRD data only for up to 1250oC synthesized sample.\nFigure 2 represents the DC magnetization (M-T) plots for samples synthesized at various\ntemperatures. Both the Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) data are shown. The\nsuperconducting transition onset Tc is found to be 9.09 K, 11.0 K, and 11.5 K respectively for\n1150\u00b0C, 1200\u00b0C, and 1250\u00b0C synthesized samples. The 1200\u00b0C sample exhibited a two step\nkind of transition in ZFC magnetization. It seems samples possess both the 1150\u00b0C, and 1250\u00b0C\nphase within. Inset of Fig. 2 depicts the Tc vs lattice parameter variation plot for variously\nsynthesized NbC samples. It can be seen that with increasing lattice parameter the Tc is\nincreasing monotonically. We synthesized NbC for higher temperatures as well but no further\nincrease in lattice parameter is observed, also phase purity of compound gets compromised. The\nincrease in Tc of NbC with its c-parameter is in agreement with an earlier report [6]. It is reported\nthat with increase of synthesis temperature the Carbon content in the crystal structure of NbC\nincreases [15, 16], similar to MgCNi3 [17, 18]. Since Carbon is a light element, so it is difficult\nto extract the exact Carbon content by XRD refinement. The exact content of Carbon can be\ndetermined through Neutron diffraction pattern, as done for MgCNi3 [18]. The dependence of Tc\nwith Carbon content is reported earlier [15, 16]. On the basis of these reports the real Carbon\ncontent in the sample having Tc = 11.5 K (synthesized at 1250oC) can be estimated to be ~ 0.99.\nThe C content in the samples synthesized at lower temperatures (1150oC and 1200oC) decreases\nand thus the Tc. Decrease in both the electron-phonon interaction parameter and the unrenormalized density of electron states causes this rapid decrease in Tc with decreasing C\nconcentration [8]. The structural changes occurring in nonstoichiometric (NbCx) as a result of the\nordering of Carbon atoms and vacancies lead to a reconstruction of their electron and phonon\nspectra. Earlier it is observed that the ordering of Carbon atoms and vacancies results in\n4\n\n\fdecreased magnetic susceptibility with an increase in the lattice parameter of the B1 basic\nstructure [13]. In any case we found that best/optimum Tc of around 11.5 K is obtained for 1250\no\n\nC samples. Neither lower (<1250oC) nor higher (> 1250oC) temperature synthesis could help in\n\nfurther improving upon the observed Tc of 11.5 K.\n\nHence now on words we focus on\n\nsuperconductivity characterization optimum Tc (11.5 K) sample, which is synthesized at 1250oC.\nFigure 3(a) shows the DC magnetization of the phase pure NbC sample (Synthesized at\n1250\u00b0C) in both field cooled (FC) and zero field cooled (ZFC) situations at 10 Oe field. The\nsample shows bulk superconductivity with an onset temperature (Tc onset) of 11.5 K. Figure 3(b)\nand 3(c) showing the real and imaginary part of AC magnetization for the same. It is clear that\nboth DC and AC susceptibility magnetization exhibit superconducting transition below 11.5K.\nThe imaginary part of AC susceptibility exhibit clear single peak at around 11 K. In case of\nsuperconductors, the real part of susceptibility depicts diamagnetic shielding of the sample, while\nimaginary part indicates the hysteric losses due to vortex motion. Maximum loss takes place\nwhen the magnetic flux lines just penetrate the centre of the sample and is indicated by the peak\nin the magnetization curve at a particular temperature called as peak temperature. The single\nsharp peak in imaginary AC susceptibility indicates the better coupling of the grains in the\nstudied NbC. As far as DC susceptibility and real part of AC susceptibility are concerned, we\ndefine the superconducting transition onset temperature Tc at a temperature where finite change\nof diamagnetic moment takes place. The Tc onset for the presently studied bulk NbC is at 11.5 K\nin both DC and AC magnetization. There seems to be large irreversibility in the DC\nmagnetization plot, indicating towards good pinning. This compound seemingly possesses no\ngrain boundary contributions. This explains its single intra-grain transition with the possibility of\nlarge irreversibility field.\nFigure 4 represents the AC magnetization of the same (1250 0C synthesized) sample,\nconfirming the bulk superconductivity at around 11.5 K. Further, AC magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements have been done at 333 Hz and varying amplitude of 3-15 Oe. With change in\namplitude from 3-15 Oe, the imaginary part peak height is increased along with increased\ndiamagnetism in real part of AC susceptibility. This is usual for a superconductor. The\ninteresting part is that the imaginary part peak position temperature (11.5 K) is not changed at all\n5\n\n\fwith increase in AC amplitude. This shows that the superconducting grains are well coupled and\nhence nearly no grain boundary contribution in the superconductivity of NbC. To check the grain\nconnectivity and morphology of the sample we have made the Scanning Electron Microscopy\n(SEM) study. Figure 5 represent the SEM image of the sample synthesized at 1250oC. Well\nconnected grains can be seen and/or grain connectivity is such that the grain boundary\ncontribution is almost zero. It is clear from AC susceptibility (imaginary part) results that either\nthe grain boundaries are non-existent in NbC or transparent to the current. This is similar to that\nas observed in case of MgCNi3 [17].\nFigure 6, shows that real part of AC susceptibility being measured applied DC bias field\nof up to 30 KOe, and its inset depicts the isothermal magnetization (M-H) plot at 3 K in high\nfield range of up to 20 kOe in four quadrants for optimized (1250oC) NbC. The lower critical\nfield (Hc1) and irreversibility field (Hirr) are around 250 Oe and 4.5 kOe, respectively, at 3 K, see\ninset Fig. 6. The upper critical field (Hc2) being determined from in-field AC susceptibility\nmeasurements, is 7.78 kOe and 11.73 kOe with 50% and 90% diamagnetism criteria,\nrespectively. NbC belongs to the dirty-limit superconductor [19]. The value of Hc2 being\nmeasured from the in field AC susceptibility measurements is close to the paramagnetic limit HP\n= 1.84Tc. Thus Zeeman pair breaking mechanism will not be effective in this case. It is clear that\nirreversibility field (Hirr) and upper critical field (Hc2) both are of the same order of magnitude.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nVacuum encapsulate NbC samples are synthesized and found to crystallize in cubic\nstructure with space group Fm-3m. Increase in lattice parameter is observed with increase in\nsynthesis temperature which leads to increase in C content in the system and thus the enhanced\nTc. An optimized Tc of 11.5 K is observed for the 1250\u00b0C synthesized NbC sample. AC\nmagnetization with field and SEM image indicated good grain connectivity for studied NbC\nsample. The upper critical field (Hc2) being determined from in-field AC susceptibility\nmeasurements, is above 11.73 kOe with 90% diamagnetism criteria. It is clear that we succeeded\nin synthesis of single phase 11.5 K NbC superconductor by quartz vacuum encapsulation in a\nsingle step.\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful for the encouragement and support from Prof. R.
