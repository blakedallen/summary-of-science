Statistical geometry\nThis paper is an overview of the information-geometric description of vapour-liquid\nphase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics. The present section begins with\na reasonably self-contained account of the relevant background material on information\ngeometry. As an illustrative example we shall examine in some detail the geometry of\nthe space of Gaussian density functions. The relation between the information measure\nof Fisher and that of Shannon and Wiener is also briefly discussed. In later sections\nthese ideas are applied to the information-geometric characterisation of the equilibrium\nproperties of noninteracting and interacting gas molecules. The relevant references are\nprovided in the bibliographical notes in Section 4, where we also provide a brief and\nperhaps incomplete history of information geometry.\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n2\n\n1.1. From probability to geometry\nThe concept of 'information geometry' is a simple one which emerged from an attempt\nto discriminate among different probabilities in statistical analysis. The idea can be\nsketched as follows. Let {pi }i=1,2,...,N denote a set of probabilities satisfying\n0 \u2264 pi \u2264 1 and\n\nN\nX\n\npi = 1.\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nWe introduce the following square-root map:\n\u221a\npi \u2192 \u03be i = pi .\n\n(2)\n\nBy construction, the square-root probabilities {\u03bei } satisfy the normalisation condition\nN\nX\n\n\u03bei2 = 1.\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nIf we regard the variables {\u03bei }i=1,2,...,N as the coordinates of a vector in an N-dimensional\nEuclidean space RN , then the normalisation condition (3) implies that the endpoint\nof the vector {\u03bei } lies on the unit sphere S in RN . Now suppose that {\u03b7i }i=1,2,...,N\ncorresponds to a second set of square-root probabilities. Then the vector {\u03b7i } also lies\non the unit sphere in RN . Hence, we can measure the relative separation or overlap of\ntwo sets of probabilities in terms of the angle\n\u03c6 = cos\u22121\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bei \u03b7i\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nbetween the associated square-root probability vectors. The angular separation \u03c6 clearly\nvanishes if {\u03bei } and {\u03b7i } are equal. Conversely, if {\u03bei } and {\u03b7i } are orthogonal then\n\u03c6 achieves its maximum value 12 \u03c0. The angular separation \u03c6 defined in (4) is known\nas the Bhattacharyya spherical distance. Note that the cosine square of the spherical\ndistance resembles the transition probability in quantum mechanics modelled on a finitedimensional Hilbert space.\nWe turn to the notion of so-called statistical geometry, which arises from the\nembedding of probability density functions in the Hilbert space of square-integrable\nfunctions. In probability theory one typically deals with a probability density function\np(x) on, say, the real line R. For the function p : x \u2192 p(x) to represent the density of\nR\nsome random variable X we require that p(x) \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 R and that R p(x)dx = 1.\nIf we consider the square-root map\np\n(5)\np(x) \u2192 \u03be(x) = p(x) ,\nthen the function \u03be(x) defined in this way belongs to the space H = L2 (R) of squareintegrable functions on the real line. In other words, we embed the density functions in\nHilbert space via the square-root map (5). In particular, since the square-root density\nfunctions satisfy the normalisation condition\nZ\n\u03be(x)2 dx = 1,\n(6)\nR\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n3\n\n\u03be1\n\n\u03c6 \u03be2\n\nFigure 1. Bhattacharyya's spherical distance. Two vectors \u03be1 (x) and \u03be2 (x),\ncorresponding to a pair of probability density functions p1 (x) and p2 (x), lie on the\nsurface of the positive orthant of the unit sphere S in Hilbert space. The spherical\ndistance between two unit vectors is given by the angle \u03c6 defined in equation (7).\n\nthe images of the map lie on the unit sphere S \u2282 H.\nThe advantage of working in Hilbert space H rather than the space of density\nfunctions is that H is a vector space endowed with various geometric features that are\nfamiliar from other branches of physics, such as quantum mechanics or general relativity.\nSuppose we have a pair of density functions p1 (x) and p2 (x), and wish to compare\nthe overlap or separation of these two density functions. If the associated Hilbert space\nvectors are given respectively by \u03be1 (x) and \u03be2 (x), then the overlap is measured in terms\nR\nof the inner product R \u03be1 (x)\u03be2 (x)dx. Since k\u03be1k = k\u03be2 k = 1, i.e. both vectors have unit\nnorm, this overlap is given by the cosine of the angular separation. It follows that the\nBhattacharyya spherical distance between two square-root density functions is\nZ\n\u22121\n\u03be1 (x)\u03be2 (x)dx.\n(7)\n\u03c6 = cos\nR\n\nThis idea is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.\n\n1.2. Parametric density and Fisher-Rao geometry\nIn theoretical statistics one typically deals with a parametric family of probability\ndensity functions p\u03b8 (x) = p(x|\u03b8). Here \u03b8 denotes one or more real parameters. For\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n4\n\nexample, a Gaussian density function is characterised by two parameters, i.e. the mean\n\u03bc and the variance \u03c3 2 . For each value, or set of values, of \u03b8 we have the normalisation\nR\ncondition R p\u03b8 (x)dx = 1.\nIn problems of statistical inference, it is often convenient to consider the loglikelihood function\nl\u03b8 (x) = ln p(x|\u03b8).\n\n(8)\n\nHowever, in physics it is more natural to work with the square-root density function\np\n(9)\n\u03be\u03b8 (x) = p(x|\u03b8),\n\nsince, as indicated above, this permits formulation of the problem in a real Hilbert-space\ncontext. As before, for each given \u03b8 the density function is mapped to a point on the\nunit sphere S \u2282 H by the prescription (9). If the value of \u03b8 is changed, the image under\nthe map in general also varies on S. We assume that the density function is at least\ntwice differentiable with respect to the parameters. Then as the parameters change\ncontinuously, the image point on S will vary smoothly over a parametric subspace M\nof the sphere S.\nGiven a parametric subspace M \u2282 S the metric of the ambient sphere S induces\na Riemannian metric on the subspace in the usual way. This can be seen as follows.\nRecall that the Hilbert space inner product is defined by\nZ\nh\u03be, \u03b7i =\n\u03be(x)\u03b7(x)dx.\n(10)\nR\n\nTherefore, if we set\n\n\u03be(x) = \u03be\u03b8 (x) and \u03b7(x) = \u03be\u03b8 (x) + \u2202i \u03be\u03b8 (x)d\u03b8i ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2202i = \u2202/\u2202\u03b8i , then the squared distance ds2 of the difference vector \u03be(x) \u2212 \u03b7(x) is\ngiven by\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n2\nds =\n\u2202i \u03be\u03b8 (x)\u2202j \u03be\u03b8 (x)dx d\u03b8i d\u03b8j .\n(12)\nR\n\nBefore we proceed further with the derivation of the metric, let us introduce the\nstatistical notion of the Fisher information matrix, which is usually defined by\nZ\nGij =\np\u03b8 (x) \u2202i l\u03b8 (x) \u2202j l\u03b8 (x) dx,\n(13)\nR\n\nwhere l\u03b8 (x) is the log-likelihood density (8). The Fisher information matrix is important\nin statistics because it provides a lower bound for the variance of a parameter\nestimate.Consider, for example, the case of a one-parameter family of density functions.\nThat is, we have a density function p\u03b8 (x) that depends upon a single unknown parameter\n\u03b8. The objective is thus to estimate the parameter by performing observations. If T (x)\nis an unbiased estimator for \u03b8, i.e. if the expectation of T (x) with respect to p\u03b8 (x) yields\n\u03b8, then we have\nZ\n(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8)\u03be\u03b8 (x)2 dx = 0.\n(14)\nR\n\n\f5\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\nDifferentiating with respect to \u03b8 we obtain\nZ\n(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8) \u03be\u03b8 (x) \u2202\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 (x) dx = 12 ,\n\n(15)\n\nR\n\nwhere \u2202\u03b8 = \u2202/\u2202\u03b8. By the Schwarz inequality\n\u0012Z\n\u00132 \u0012Z\n\u0013 \u0012Z\n\u0013\n2\n2\n2\n(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8) \u03be\u03b8 (x) \u2202\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 (x) dx \u2264\n(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8) \u03be\u03b8 (x) dx\n(\u2202\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 (x)) dx (16)\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nwe thus find\n\nZ\n\nR\n\n(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8)2 \u03be\u03b8 (x)2 dx \u2265\n\n1\n.\n4 R (\u2202\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 (x))2 dx\nR\n\n(17)\n\nNote that the left side is the variance of the estimator, whereas the denominator of the\nright side is the one-parameter form of the Fisher information matrix. The relation (17)\nprovides a lower bound for the variance, and is known as the Cram\u00e9r-Rao inequality.\nThe inequality in (16) is attained only when the two vectors are proportional, that\nis, \u2202\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 (x) = c(T (x) \u2212 \u03b8) \u03be\u03b8 (x) for some constant c. By scaling \u03b8 we can set c = 12\nwithout loss of generality. Hence, the lower bound of the variance is attained only if the\nsquare-root density assumes an exponential form:\n\u0001\nexp 21 \u03b8T (x)\n(18)\n\u03be\u03b8 (x) = R\n\u00011/2 .\nexp\n(\u03b8T\n(x))\ndx\nR\n\nThe exponential family (18) plays an important role in the applications to statistical\nmechanics considered below.\nIn a multi-parameter context the reciprocal of the Fisher information matrix\ndetermines lower bounds for the variance in an analogous manner. From the geometrical\nviewpoint, the significance of the Fisher information matrix is that it defines the induced\nRiemannian metric on the parametric subspace M of the unit sphere S in H. Specifically,\ncomparing (12) and (13) we see that\nds2 = 14 Gij d\u03b8i d\u03b8j .\n\n(19)\n\nThe metric 14 Gij on M will be referred to as the Fisher-Rao metric. The factor of a\nquarter is purely a matter of convention, and the Fisher-Rao metric is thus given by a\nquarter of the Fisher information matrix.\n1.3. Riemannian structure of the exponential family\nWe introduce here some elementary concepts in Riemannian geometry that are relevant\nto the ensuring discussion. We note first that all equilibrium distributions that we\nconsider here are represented in the exponential form\n!\nX\ni\n\u03b8 Hi (x) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8) ,\n(20)\np\u03b8 (x) = q(x) exp \u2212\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere {\u03b8 }i=1,2,... are parameters, q(x) represents the prescribed equilibrium state at\n\u03b8i = 0 for all i, and the functions {Hi (x)}i=1,2,... determine the form of the energy. In\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n6\n\nother words, we shall only consider equilibrium states represented in the canonical form.\nThe parameters {\u03b8i } may include inverse temperature, chemical potential, pressure,\nmagnetic field, and so on, whereas the functions Hi (x) may represent system energy,\nparticle number, system volume, magnetisation, and so on. The variable x ranges over\nthe phase space \u0393 of the system. The function\n!\nZ\nX\n\u03c8(\u03b8) = ln exp \u2212\n\u03b8i Hi (x) q(x)dx\n(21)\n\u0393\n\ni\n\ndetermines the overall normalisation. We refer to \u03c8(\u03b8) as the thermodynamic potential\nof the system. It should be evident by inspection that\nR\nP\nH (x) exp (\u2212 i \u03b8i Hi (x)) q(x)dx\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u0393 Ri\nP i\n\u2212 i =\n\u2202\u03b8\nexp\n(\u2212\ni \u03b8 Hi (x)) q(x)dx\nZ \u0393\n=\nHi (x)p\u03b8 (x)dx.\n(22)\n\u0393\n\nIn other words, the first derivative of \u03c8(\u03b8) with respect to \u03b8i determines the expectation\nvalue of Hi (x) in the equilibrium state (20). As we shall indicate below, analogous\ncalculations show that higher derivatives of the thermodynamic potential \u03c8(\u03b8) determine\nhigher moments of the functions {Hi (x)}.\nIf the equilibrium density function assumes the form (20), then the expressions\nfor the corresponding Fisher-Rao metric and the coefficients of the associated metric\nconnection on the statistical manifold M are simplified. Let us state the results first.\n\nProposition 1 For a density function of the exponential form (20) the Fisher-Rao\nmetric Gij and the Christoffel symbols \u0393ijk = Gil \u0393ljk are given, respectively, by\nGij = \u2202i \u2202j \u03c8(\u03b8)\n\n(23)\n\n1\n2\n\n(24)\n\nand\n\u0393ijk =\n\n\u2202i \u2202j \u2202k \u03c8(\u03b8),\n\nin terms of the canonical parametrisation {\u03b8i } on M, where \u2202i = \u2202/\u2202\u03b8i .\nThe Christoffel symbols characterise the geodesics on M. Specifically, to find the\nshortest path from a to b on M we consider the variational problem:\nZ b\n\u03b4\nds = 0.\n(25)\na\n\nFrom (19) we find\n\n\u2202Gik l\n\u03b4\u03b8 + 2Gik d\u03b8i d\u03b4\u03b8k .\n\u2202\u03b8l\nBearing in mind that the right side of (26) equals 8ds \u03b4ds, we obtain\n\u0015\nZ b\u0014\ni\nk\nd\u03b8i d\u03b4\u03b8k\nl\n1 d\u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2202Gik\nds = 0.\n\u03b4\u03b8 + Gik\n2\nds ds \u2202\u03b8k\nds ds\na\n4\u03b4ds2 = d\u03b8i d\u03b8k\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n7\n\nIntegrating the second term in the integrand by parts and writing ui = d\u03b8i /ds we see\nthat (27) reduces to\n\u0015\nZ b\u0014\n\u0001\nd\ni\n1 i k \u2202Gik\nGil u \u03b4\u03b8l ds = 0.\n(28)\n\u2212\nuu\n2\nl\n\u2202\u03b8\nds\na\nSince this must hold for arbitrary \u03b4\u03b8l we have\n\u0001\nd\n1 i k \u2202Gik\nuu\nGil ui = 0.\n\u2212\n2\nl\n\u2202\u03b8\nds\nWriting\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Gmk \u2202Gml \u2202Gkl\ni\n1 im\n+\n\u2212\n\u0393 kl = 2 G\n\u2202\u03b8l\n\u2202\u03b8k\n\u2202\u03b8m\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nfor the Christoffel symbol we find that (29) can be expressed in the form\nl\nk\nd2 \u03b8i\ni d\u03b8 d\u03b8\n+\n\u0393\n= 0.\n(31)\nkl\nds2\nds ds\nThis is the geodesic equation that determines the shortest paths on M. Owing to their\nnonlinearity, geodesic equations do not generally admit elementary analytic solutions,\nalthough in some cases one can solve (31) in closed form, as in the Gaussian example\ndiscussed below.\n\nProof of Proposition 1. From (20) we have\n\u2202i l\u03b8 (x) = \u2212 (Hi (x) + \u2202i \u03c8(\u03b8)) .\nOn the other hand, differentiating the normalisation condition\nZ\np\u03b8 (x)dx = 1\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\n\u0393\n\nonce with respect to \u03b8i and using \u2202i p\u03b8 (x) = p\u03b8 (x)\u2202i l\u03b8 (x) we obtain\nZ\np\u03b8 (x) (Hi (x) + \u2202i \u03c8(\u03b8)) dx = 0,\n\n(34)\n\n\u0393\n\nwhence it follows that the expectation of Hi (x) with respect to p\u03b8 (x) is given by \u2212\u2202i \u03c8(\u03b8),\nas shown in (22). Differentiating (34) with respect to \u03b8j , we find that\nZ\n\u2212 p\u03b8 (x) (Hi (x) + \u2202i \u03c8(\u03b8)) (Hj (x) + \u2202j \u03c8(\u03b8)) dx + \u2202i \u2202j \u03c8(\u03b8) = 0.\n(35)\n\u0393\n\nIn view of (32) and (13), this implies that the Fisher-Rao metric Gij is given by (23).\nFrom (30) we have\n\u0393ikl = 21 (\u2202l Gik + \u2202k Gil \u2212 \u2202i Gkl ) ,\n\n(36)\n\nbut since the metric is given by (23) we immediately deduce the expression (24) for the\nChristoffel symbols.\n\u0003\nIt is important to note that if we choose an alternative parametrisation for M, then\nthe components of the metric tensor and the Christoffel symbol cannot be calculated\nusing the simple expressions given in Proposition 1, and we must use the defining\nequations (13) and (30) to determine these quantities. Also note that the metric tensor\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n8\n\nis the covariance matrix of the functions {Hi (x)}, whereas the components of \u0393ijk are\nthird-order cross-moments of {Hi (x)}.\nIn terms of the Christoffel symbols \u0393ijk the Riemann curvature tensor Ri ljk can be\nexpressed as\nRi ljk = \u2202k \u0393ilj \u2212 \u2202j \u0393ilk \u2212 \u0393ijh \u0393hlk + \u0393ikh \u0393hlj .\n\n(37)\n\nThe Riemann tensor encodes the local geometry of M, and is related to the parallel\ntransport of vectors on M. In particular, if we define the covariant derivative by\n\u2202Ai\n\u2212 \u0393kij Ak ,\n(38)\n\u2207j Ai =\n\u2202\u03b8j\nthen the commutator of the covariant derivatives defines the Riemann tensor:\n\u2207j \u2207k Ai \u2212 \u2207k \u2207j Ai = Al Rl ijk .\n\n(39)\n\nThe symmetry properties of the Riemann tensor can be derived by lowering the index\nwith the metric and writing Rijkl = Gim Rmjkl . Specifically, this is given by\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u2202 Gil\n\u2202 2 Gjk\n\u2202 2 Gik\n\u2202 2 Gjl\n1\nRijkl = 2\n+ i l \u2212 j l \u2212 i k + Gnm \u0393njk \u0393mil \u2212 \u0393njl \u0393mik ,\n(40)\nj\nk\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\nwhence it follows that Rijkl = Rklij . Along with the relation Ri jkl = \u2212Ri jlk that follows\nfrom (37) we find that Rijkl = \u2212Rijlk = \u2212Rjikl . Therefore, the components of Rijkl\nvanish when i = j or k = l. In the case of a two-dimensional manifold M the only\nnonvanishing components of the Riemann tensor are given by\nR1212 = \u2212R1221 = \u2212R2112 = R2121 .\n\n(41)\n\nIn other words, R1212 is the sole independent component in two dimensions.\nGiven a Riemann tensor Ri jkl we define the associated Ricci tensor by the symmetric\nexpression\nRjl = Rkjkl .\n\n(42)\n\nEquivalently, we can write Rjl = Gik Rijkl . A further contraction with the metric defines\nthe scalar curvature:\nR = Gjl Rjl .\n\n(43)\n\nWe call (43) the Ricci scalar curvature. If the Ricci tensor Rjl is proportional to the\nmetric tensor Gjl then the manifold M is called an Einstein space. This is because the\nmetric of such a space satisfies the vacuum Einstein equation\nRik \u2212 21 \u03b4 ik R = 0,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere Rik = Gil Rlk . The significance of the Einstein equation in statistics or statistical\nmechanics can be seen if we relax the normalisation condition on the square-root density\nfunction \u03be(x) and thus eliminate the physically irrelevant degree of freedom associated\nwith the norm k\u03be(x)k. Specifically, if T (x) represents an observable function on the\nphase space \u0393 then its expectation value in the generic 'state' \u03be(x) is\nR\n\u03be(x)T (x)\u03be(x)dx\n.\n(45)\nhT (x)i = \u0393 R\n\u03be(x)2 dx\n\u0393\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n9\n\nEvidently, the expectation so defined is invariant under the scale transformation\n\u03be(x) \u2192 \u03bb\u03be(x), where \u03bb is an arbitrary nonzero number. Thus, all the relevant statistical\ninformation is encoded in the direction of the vector \u03be(x) \u2208 H, irrespective of its length.\nVia the identification \u03be(x) \u223c \u03bb\u03be(x) we obtain a space of rays in H, which is known as\nthe real projective Hilbert space. Suppose now that we consider the Einstein equation\n(44) for the metric on the projective Hilbert space. Then there is a unique solution\nwhich is induced by the infinitesimal form of the Bhattacharyya spherical distance (7).\nSpecifically, this is obtained by setting \u03be1 (x) = \u03be(x) and \u03be2 (x) = \u03be(x) + d\u03be(x) in\nR\n\u00012\n\u03be\n(x)\u03be\n(x)dx\n1\n2\nR\n\u0001 R\n\u0001,\n(46)\ncos2 \u03c6 = R\n\u03be\n(x)\u03be\n\u03be (x)\u03be2 (x)dx\n1 (x)dx\nR 1\nR 2\nTaylor expanding each side, and retaining terms of quadratic order. Then with the\nnotation of (10) we can write\n\u03c62 =\n\nhd\u03be, d\u03bei h\u03be, d\u03bei2\n\u2212\n,\nh\u03be, \u03bei\nh\u03be, \u03bei2\n\n(47)\n\nwhich defines a metric on the projective Hilbert space. It follows that the Einstein\nequation uniquely determines the probabilistic properties of the space of densities.\nFor a statistical manifold M associated with a distribution of the exponential type\n(20), the Riemann tensor assumes a simple form because the first two terms in (37)\ncancel, and only the contractions of the Christoffel symbols remain.\nThe examples of statistical mechanical systems considered here are parameterised\nby a pair of external variables, so that the statistical manifold M is two-dimensional.\nIn this case, the expression for the scalar curvature admits further simplifications.\nSpecifically, we have the following:\nProposition 2 In terms of the canonical parametrisation (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), the scalar curvature\nof a two-dimensional statistical model corresponding to the density function (20) is given\nby the determinant\n1\nR=\u2212 2\n2G\n\n\u03c811 (\u03b8) \u03c812 (\u03b8) \u03c8,22 (\u03b8)\n\u03c8111 (\u03b8) \u03c8112 (\u03b8) \u03c8122 (\u03b8) ,\n\u03c8112 (\u03b8) \u03c8122 (\u03b8) \u03c8222 (\u03b8),\n\n(48)\n\nwhere G = det(Gij ) is the determinant of the Fisher-Rao metric, and where \u03c812 (\u03b8) =\n\u2202 2 \u03c8(\u03b8)/\u2202\u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 , \u03c8112 (\u03b8) = \u2202 3 \u03c8(\u03b8)/\u2202\u03b81 \u2202\u03b81 \u2202\u03b82 , and so on.\nProof. Recall that the scalar curvature is defined by the contraction\nRijkl = (\u0393kmi \u0393jln \u2212 \u0393kmj \u0393iln ) Gmn .\n\n(49)\n\nSubstituting (24) and the inverse of (23) in (49), we obtain (48) after some rearrangement\nof terms.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n1.4. Geometry of Gaussian distributions\n\nAs an elementary illustrative example, consider the Gaussian (normal) distribution\nN(\u03bc, \u03c3) on the real line R with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 > 0. For the parameterised\ndensity function we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(x \u2212 \u03bc)2\n.\n(50)\np(x|\u03bc, \u03c3) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\nThe normal density function can be rewritten in the canonical form\n\u0002\n\u0003\np(x|\u03b8) = exp \u2212\u03b81 x2 \u2212 \u03b82 x \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b8) ,\n(51)\nwhere\n\n1\n,\n\u03b8 =\n2\u03c3\n1\n\n\u03bc\n\u03b8 = \u2212 2,\n\u03c3\n2\n\nand \u03c8(\u03b8) =\n\n1\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b82\n\u03b81\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0010 \u221a2\u03c0 \u0011\n.\n\u2212 ln\n2\u03b81\n\n(52)\n\nBy differentiating \u03c8(\u03b8) with respect to the parameters {\u03b8i } we can determine the\ncomponents of the metric tensor Gij (\u03b8) in the coordinate system specified by the\ncanonical parametrisation {\u03b8i }.\nAlternatively, we may regard the mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 as coordinates on the\nstatistical manifold M. In terms of the parameters (\u03bc, \u03c3) the metric does not admit a\nsimple representation (23), and we must perform the Gaussian integration in the defining\nrelation (13). The line element then becomes\n1\n(53)\nds2 = 2 (d\u03bc2 + 2d\u03c3 2 )\n\u03c3\nwhich is defined on the upper-half plane \u2212\u221e < \u03bc < \u221e and 0 < \u03c3 < \u221e. Since the\nmetric Gij is diagonal in these coordinates, it is easily inverted and we obtain\n!\n1\n0\nGij = \u03c3 2\n.\n(54)\n0 12\nA short calculation shows that the Christoffel symbols are given by\n1\n\u0393112 = \u0393121 = \u22122\u0393211 = \u0393222 = \u2212 ,\n\u0393111 = \u0393122 = \u0393212 = \u0393221 = 0.\n(55)\n\u03c3\nSince the inverse of the metric tensor (54) is diagonal, we need only determine the\ndiagonal components of the Ricci tensor in order to calculate the scalar curvature (that\nis, the off-diagonal elements of the Ricci tensor vanish). These are\n1\n1\nR11 = \u2212 2 and R22 = \u2212 2 ,\n(56)\n2\u03c3\n\u03c3\nrespectively. Hence, the resulting geometry is that of a hyperbolic space, which is a\nhomogeneous manifold of constant negative curvature:\nR = \u22121.\n\n(57)\n\nThis space has many interesting properties. For example, the geodesic equations\n(31) characterising trajectories of shortest paths on M are determined by the equations\n1 d\u03bc(s) d\u03c3(s)\nd2 \u03bc(s)\n\u22122\n=0\n2\nds\n\u03c3(s) ds\nds\n\n(58)\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n11\n\nand\n1\nd2 \u03c3(s)\n+\n2\nds\n\u03c3(s)\n\n( \u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 )\n1 d\u03bc(s)\nd\u03c3(s)\n= 0.\n\u2212\n2\nds\nds\n\n(59)\n\nSince \u03c3 > 0 we can divide (58) and (59) by \u03c3, obtaining\n\u0010 \u03bc\u2032 \u0011 \u2032 \u03bc\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u2032 \u0011\u2032 1 \u03bc\u2032 \u03bc\u2032\n= 0 and\n= 0,\n(60)\n\u2212\n+\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\n\u03c3\n2\u03c3 \u03c3\nwhere the prime indicates d/ds. It follows that\n\u0012\u0010 \u2032 \u0011\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u2032 \u00112 \u0013\u2032\n\u03bc 2\n= 0,\n(61)\n+2\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nand hence that\n\u0010 \u03bc\u2032 \u0011 2\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u2032 \u00112\n+2\n= v2,\n(62)\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nwhere v \u2265 0 is a constant. On the other hand, if we define X = \u03bc\u2032 /\u03c3 then from the\nfirst equation of (60) we have X\u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 X \u2032 \u03c3 = 0, or equivalently (X/\u03c3)\u2032 = 0, and thus\n\u03bc\u2032 /\u03c3 = c \u03c3, where c is a constant. Substituting this in (62) we deduce that\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u2032 \u00112\n= v2,\n(63)\nc2 \u03c3 2 +\n\u03c3\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere we have rescaled the integration constants, i.e. c \u2192 2c and v \u2192 2v. There\nare now two cases to consider, depending on whether c is zero or nonzero.\nIf c = 0, then \u03bc is constant, and \u03c3 \u2032 = v\u03c3, so that \u03c3(s) = aevs for some constants a\nand v such that a > 0 and v > 0. This represents a straight line parallel to the \u03c3 axis in\nthe \u03bc-\u03c3 plane. If c 6= 0, then c \u03c3 \u2264 v from (63), hence \u03c3(s) = vc sin \u03b3(s) for some \u03b3(s).\nSubstituting this into (63) we obtain\n\u0012 \u00132\nd\u03b3\n= v 2 sin2 \u03b3(s).\n(64)\nds\nSince \u03b3 \u2032 6= 0, \u03b3(s) is monotonic and thus invertible. We may assume, without loss of\ngenerality, that \u03b3 \u2032 > 0 so that (64) implies d\u03b3/ds = v sin \u03b3.

The shortest path joining the two normal distributions N (\u03bc1 , \u03c31 ) and\nN (\u03bc2 , \u03c32 ) is given by the unique semi-circular arc through the given two points and\ncentred on the boundary line \u03c3 = 0.\n\nThese equations represent half-circles on the \u03bc-\u03c3 plane centred on the \u03bc axis (\u03c3 = 0)\nwith radius v/c.

These results follow directly from the fact that the geodesics are\nsemi-circular arcs centred on the boundary line \u03c3 = 0 (this line itself is not part of the\nmanifold M because \u03c3 > 0). In the exceptional case when \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 , the geodesic is a\nstraight line \u03bc = constant, and\n\n\u03c31\n1\n.\n(71)\nD(\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) = \u221a log\n\u03c32\n2\nThe above example illustrates how various geometric aspects of a statistical\nmanifold M can be investigated in a systematic manner. It is interesting to note,\nin particular, that the Gaussian distributions define an elementary hyperbolic geometry\nwith constant negative curvature. Before examining various geometric characterisations\nof ideal and interacting gases in thermal equilibrium, let us discuss the relation between\nthe Fisher-Rao distance measure and various measures of entropy, a topic of some\ninterest.\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n13\n\n1.5. From entropy to Fisher information\nWe have observed how the notion of information geometry arises from the Fisher\ninformation matrix commonly used in statistical analysis. On the other hand, the\nterm 'information' often suggests the concept of entropy, rather than the Fisher matrix.\nIndeed, the entropy concept is essential in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\nTherefore, it would be appropriate to clarify the interrelation between these two notions\nof information.\nWe shall discuss entropy in a fairly general context, and consider as before a\nparametric family of probability density functions p(x|\u03b8) which we assume to be defined,\nsay, on the real line R, where \u03b8 = {\u03b8i }. Then with respect to any twice-differentiable\nconcave function \u03c6(p) we define the associated entropy functional by the expression\nZ\nH\u03c6 (p) =\n\u03c6[p(x|\u03b8)]dx.\n(72)\nR\n\nNow, if f represents a vector in the tangent space (at p) of the manifold of density\nfunctions, then the derivative of the entropy H\u03c6 at p in the direction f is defined by\nd\nH\u03c6 (p + sf )\nds\ns=0\nZ\n=\n\u03c6\u2032 [p(x)]f (x)dx,\n\ndH\u03c6 (p; f ) =\n\n(73)\n\nR\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2032 (p) = d\u03c6(p)/dp. Similarly, if f and g are two vectors in the tangent space at\np, we define the Hessian of H\u03c6 by\nZ\n2\nd H\u03c6 (p; f, g) =\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 [p(x)]f (x)g(x)dx.\n(74)\nR\n\nThe corresponding quadratic form is\n\n\u25b3f H\u03c6 (p) = 4d2 H\u03c6 (p; f, f ),\n\n(75)\n\nor equivalently,\n\u25b3f H\u03c6 (p) = 4\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 [p(x)]f 2 (x)dx,\n\n(76)\n\nR\n\nwhere the factor of 4 here is purely conventional. The concavity of \u03c6 then implies that\n\u2212 \u25b3f H\u03c6 (p) \u2265 0.\nIn particular, if we chose f to be \u2202i p, where \u2202i = \u2202/\u2202\u03b8i , then we have\nZ\n\u25b3\u2202p H\u03c6 (p) = 4 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 [p(x|\u03b8)] (\u2202i p(x|\u03b8))2 dx.\n\n(77)\n\n(78)\n\nR\n\nThus far, we have not specified the form of the function \u03c6, except for the\nrequirements of concavity and twice differentiability. As a special case, let us consider\nthe one-parameter family of concave functions\n\u03c6\u03b1 (z) = (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u22121 (z \u2212 z \u03b1 ),\n\n(79)\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n14\n\nwhere \u03b1 > 0. This determines a one-parameter family of entropies H\u03b1 (p) given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n\u03b1\n1 \u2212 p (x)dx .\n(80)\nH\u03b1 (p) =\n\u03b1\u22121\nNote that when \u03b1 = 1 we have \u03c61 (z) = \u2212z ln z and hence\nZ\nH1 (p) = \u2212 p(x) ln p(x)dx.\n(81)\n\nIn other words, we recover the expression for the familiar Shannon-Wiener entropy in\nthe limit \u03b1 \u2192 1. In the general case, the expression (80) defines the Havrda-Charv\u00e1t\nentropy (also known as the \u03b1-order entropy), which is related to the well-known R\u00e9nyi\nentropy R\u03b1 (p) as follows:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nR\u03b1 (p) =\nln 1 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)H\u03b1 (p) .\n(82)\n1\u2212\u03b1\nIn particular, R\u03b1 is monotonic in H\u03b1 .\nAlso, choosing \u03c6\u03b1 as in (79) we find that\n1\n1\n(83)\nds2\u03b1 = \u2212 \u25b3\u2202~pH\u03c6 (p) = \u2212 d2 H\u03c6 (p; \u2202i p, \u2202j p)d\u03b8i d\u03b8j\n4\u03b1\n\u03b1\nis positive definite and defines a Riemannian metric. We can summarise this as follows.\nProposition 3 (Burbea-Rao metric) The coefficients of the differential metric\n(\u03b1)\n\nds2\u03b1 = Gij d\u03b8i d\u03b8j\nassociated with the Hessian of the \u03b1-order entropy (80) are\nZ\n(\u03b1)\nGij = p\u03b1 (\u2202i ln p)(\u2202j ln p)dx.\n\n(84)\n\n(85)\n\n(\u03b1)\n\nIn particular, when \u03b1 = 1, Gij reduces to the Fisher-Rao metric.\nProof. The expression in (85) follows at once from (83) by virtue of the relation\n= \u2212\u03b1p\u03b1\u22122 .\n\u0003\nWe find, therefore, that the so-called \u03b1-order entropy metric is closely related to the\nFisher-Rao geometry of the statistical manifold. In addition, there is another significant\nrelationship between the derivative of the entropy and the \u03b1-order Fisher information\nmatrix. This can be established as follows. From the defining equation (80) we have\nZ\nZ\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u22122\np\u03b1\u22121 \u2202i \u2202j p dx,\n(86)\n\u2202i \u2202j H\u03b1 (p) = \u2212\u03b1 p (\u2202i p)(\u2202j p)dx \u2212\n\u03b1\u22121 R\nR\nand therefore we deduce that\nZ\n1\n1\n(\u03b1)\np\u03b1\u22121 \u2202i \u2202j p dx.\n(87)\nGij = \u2212 \u2202i \u2202j H\u03b1 (p) +\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u22121 R\nFor the canonical distribution (20), the limit \u03b1 \u2192 1 of this relation yields the ShannonWiener entropy\nX Z\n(88)\nH1 (p) =\n\u03b8i p(x|\u03b8)Hi (x)dx + \u03c8(\u03b8).\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u03b1 (p)\n\ni\n\nIn other words, the thermodynamic potential and the entropy are related by a Legendre\ntransformation. Consequently, the Fisher-Rao geometry and the geometry arising from\nthe Hessian of the Shannon-Wiener entropy are related by the general theory of Legendre\ntransforms.\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n15\n\n2. Classical ideal gas\nWe shall now characterise the geometry of the statistical manifold that arises from\nthe equilibrium distribution of a gas of noninteracting particles. Although this system\ndisplays no phase transition, the analysis presented here will provide an enlightening\ncontrast with the results of Section 3 where we shall examine the geometry of the van\nder Waals gas, which does exhibit a liquid-vapour transition.\n2.1. Partition function in P -T distribution\nTo elucidate the geometrical representation of gaseous systems in statistical mechanics,\nwe begin our analysis with a system of noninteracting identical particles in the absence\nof potential energy. Physically, this system corresponds to a classical ideal gas immersed\nin a heat bath. As we shall show below, not only the Riemann curvature but also the\ngeodesic equations for this system can be solved exactly. We consider, in particular, a\npressure-temperature (P -T ) distribution (also known as the Boguslavski distribution)\nof the form\nexp (\u2212\u03b2H \u2212 \u03b1V )\n(89)\np(H, V |\u03b1, \u03b2) =\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2)\ndefined on the phase space \u0393 of a system of noninteracting particles. Here the partition\nfunction Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) is determined by the phase-space and volume integral\n\u0013\nZ \u221e \u0012Z\n1\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\nexp (\u2212\u03b2H) dqdp exp (\u2212\u03b1V ) dV.\n(90)\nN!h3N 0\n\u0393\nAs usual, we have \u03b2 = 1/kB T , \u03b1 = P/kB T , where P denotes the pressure, h the Planck\nconstant, and N the number of particles. The Hamiltonian H is just the free particle\nkinetic energy\nH=\n\nN\nX\np2i\n.\n2m\ni=1\n\n(91)\n\nThus, we consider a closed system of noninteracting gas molecules immersed in a heat\nbath at inverse temperature \u03b2 and effective pressure \u03b1. Since the system is in contact\nwith a bath at fixed temperature and pressure, the system energy and volume fluctuate.\nIn thermal equilibrium, the distribution of these variables is determined by (89). For\na real gas, the constituent particles inevitably interact. Nevertheless, the ideal gas\nrepresented by the distribution (89) adequately characterises the properties of a real gas\nat high temperature or low density, where the effects of inter-particle interactions can\nbe neglected.\nComparing (89) and (20) we observe that the thermodynamic potential is given\nby \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) = ln Z(\u03b1, \u03b2). Therefore, to determine the Fisher-Rao metric (23) we must\nperform the integration (90). Noting the fact that each q-integration in (90) gives the\nvolume V of the system, one obtains the partition function\n\u00133N/2\n\u0012\n2\u03c0m\n\u03b1\u2212(N +1) .\n(92)\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n2\nh \u03b2\n\n\f16\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\nThis follows from the fact that\nZ\nZ\nexp (\u2212\u03b2H) dqdp =\n\u0393\n\nq\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\ne\np\n\np2\ni\ni=1 2m\n\nPN\n\nN\nY\ni=1\n\ndpi\n\n!\n\nN\nY\n\ndqi\n\n(93)\n\ni=1\n\nis just a product of Gaussian integrals, and the identity\nZ \u221e\n1\nV N e\u2212\u03b1V dV = \u03b1\u2212(N +1)\nN! 0\nthat holds for \u03b1 > 0.\nNote that the partition function z(\u03b2, V ) in the canonical ensemble is\nZ\n1\nexp (\u2212\u03b2H) dqdp\nz(\u03b2, V ) =\nN!h3N \u0393\n\u0012\n\u00133N/2\n1 2\u03c0m\n=\nV N,\n2\nN! h \u03b2\n\n(94)\n\n(95)\n\nfrom which one can calculate the Helmholtz free energy\nF (\u03b2, V ) = \u2212kB T ln z(\u03b2, V )\n\n(96)\n\nand thus obtain the equation of state\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202F\n= NkB T /V\nP =\u2212\n\u2202V \u03b2\n\n(97)\n\nsatisfied by a classical ideal gas.\n2.2. Curvature and geodesics for ideal gas\nThe expression (92) for the partition function clearly shows that the Riemannian\ngeometry of the statistical model M associated with the classical ideal gas depends upon\nthe number N of particles. Although finite size effects in small systems are sometimes of\ninterest, here we are primarily concerned with the geometry that arises in the so-called\nthermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e. Thus, we consider the thermodynamic potential \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2)\nper particle in the thermodynamic limit, given by\n3 2\u03c0m\n(98)\n\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) = lim N \u22121 ln Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) = ln 2 \u2212 ln \u03b1.\nN \u2192\u221e\n2\nh\u03b2\nThe components of the Fisher-Rao metric, with respect to the parameterisation (\u03b1, \u03b2),\ncan then be calculated by differentiation, with the result\n!\n\u03b1\u22122\n0\nGij =\n.\n(99)\n0 32 \u03b2 \u22122\nFrom this expression we deduce the following.\nProposition 4 All components of the Riemann tensor, and consequently also the scalar\ncurvature, of the statistical manifold M associated with the classical ideal gas vanish,\nand thus the manifold is flat.\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n17\n\nProof. From the components of the metric (99) one can calculate the components of\nthe Christoffel symbol \u0393ijk and the Riemann tensor Ri jkl using the definitions (24) and\n(37). Alternatively, to show that this manifold is flat, it suffices to display a change of\ncoordinates which transforms the metric (99) into a Euclidean metric. Here, we adopt\nthe latter approach because this also permits more expeditious solution of the geodesic\nequations. We recall that under a coordinate transformation xi \u2192 x\u0304i the metric of a\nRiemannian manifold transforms in the usual tensorial manner, so that the components\nof the inverse metric in the new coordinate system are determined by the contraction\nj\ni\nij\nkl dx\u0304 dx\u0304\n.\n(100)\n\u1e20 = G\ndxk dxl\nConsider the following coordinate transformation\nq\n(101)\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1\u2032 = ln \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2 \u2032 = 32 ln \u03b2.\nA straightforward calculation then shows that the components of the inverse metric in\nthe (\u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032) coordinate system are\n!\n1\n0\n\u1e20ij =\n,\n(102)\n0 1\nand thus the manifold is indeed flat.\n\u0003\nSince the statistical manifold associated with the ideal gas is flat, solution of the\ngeodesic equations is straightforward. The result can be summarised as follows.\nProposition 5 The geodesic curves on the statistical manifold M associated with the\nclassical ideal gas are given by\n\u00131+c\n\u0012\nkB T\nP\n=\n,\n(103)\nP0\nkB T0\nwhere P0 , T0 , and c are integration constants. In particular, the geodesics include the\nadiabatic equation of state for the ideal gas, corresponding to the choice c = \u2212CV /NkB ,\nwhere CV is the constant-volume heat capacity.\nProof. The geodesic equations for the variables \u03b1 and \u03b2 assume identical forms, i.e.\nd2 x 1 \u0010 dx \u00112\n\u2212\n=0\n(104)\nds2\nx ds\nfor x = \u03b1, \u03b2. This can be rewritten as\nd \u0010 dx \u0011\nd\n=\nln\nln x,\n(105)\nds\nds\nds\nfrom which we see that the general solution is x(s) = c1 ec2 s . Thus, we obtain\n1\nP\n= c1 ec0 s and\n= c3 ec2 s\n(106)\nkB T\nkB T\nas the general solution to the geodesic equations. Combining these two equations, we\nhave\nc1\n(107)\nP = c0 /c2 (kB T )1\u2212c0 /c2 .\nc3\nSetting s = 0 we find c1 = P0 /kB T0 and c3 = 1/kB T0 , which yields at once the expression\nin (103).\n\u0003\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n18\n\n3. Van der Waals gas\nThe geometry of the statistical manifold changes considerably if the gas molecules\ninteract. In particular, if the system exhibits a phase transition, then the curvature\ntends to become singular at the transition point. This property seems to be universal and\nappears in many systems exhibiting critical phenomena. The van der Waals gas model\nis not only of physical interest, but also illustrates many of the universal geometrical\nfeatures of the associated manifold of equilibrium states.\n3.1. Equation of state\nThe idealised system of noninteracting particles considered above is inadequate for the\ndescription of phase transition phenomena, that is, the condensation of gas molecules.\nHere we shall extend the model to include inter-particle interactions, which leads to the\nvan der Waals equation of state:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN2\n(108)\nP + a 2 (V \u2212 bN) = NkB T,\nV\n\nwhere N is the total number of molecules and a, b are constants determined by the\nproperties of the molecule. The liquid-vapour transition occurs at the critical point\nwhere the temperature T , pressure P , and volume V simultaneously assume the values\n8a\na\n, Vc = 3bN, and Tc =\n.\n(109)\nPc =\n2\n27b\n27kB b\nThe critical point is determined by the simultaneous solution of the equations\n\u22022P\n\u2202P\n= 0 and\n= 0.\n\u2202V\n\u2202V 2\nUsing the dimensionless variables\nP\nV\nT\nP\u0302 = , V\u0302 = , and T\u0302 = ,\nPc\nVc\nTc\nthe equation of state can be rewritten in the universal form\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\nP\u0302 + 3V\u0302 \u22122 V\u0302 \u2212 13 = 83 T\u0302 ,\n\n(110)\n\n(111)\n\n(112)\n\nindependent of the parameters a and b. In Figure 3 we plot the pressure P\u0302 as a function\nof the volume V\u0302 for T\u0302 > 1, T\u0302 = 1, and T\u0302 < 1.\nNote that the positivity of the pressure implies a bound on the temperature. In\nparticular, from (112) we deduce that the condition P\u0302 \u2265 0 is equivalent to the bound:\nT\u0302 \u2265\n\n9V\u0302 \u2212 3\n8V\u0302 2\n\n,\n\n(113)\n\nin terms of the dimensionless volume V\u0302 . If we demand the positivity of P\u0302 for all volumes\n, or equivalently\nV\u0302 \u2265 13 , then we must require T\u0302 \u2265 27\n32\nT \u2265\n\n27\nTc .\n32\n\n(114)\n\n\f19\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nT = 1.4\nP\n4\n\nT = 1.0\nT = 27\n32\nT = 0.6\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nV\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-1\n-2\n-3\nFigure 3. Equations of state for the van der Waals gas in terms of dimensionless\nvariables. The isothermal curves correspond to T\u0302 = 1.4, T\u0302 = 1, T\u0302 = 27/32 (maximum\nsuperheating temperature) and T\u0302 = 0.6. Note that the isothermal curves associated\nwith temperatures below Tm allow metastable regions for which P\u0302 < 0.\n\nThe temperature\n27\nTc \u2248 0.85Tc\n(115)\n32\nis known as the temperature of maximum superheating and is related to the nucleation\nof bubbles when the liquid is heated very abruptly. In particular, if T < Tm then the\nliquid can be contained at low external pressure, whereas if T > Tm the liquid cannot\nexist under low external pressure and thus evaporates. Experimental data show, for\nexample, that Tm = 0.89Tc for ether, Tm = 0.92Tc for alcohol, and Tm = 0.84Tc for\nwater, indicating the fairly accurate predictive power of the van der Waals equations of\nstate.\nTurning to the equations of state, the pressure P as a function of the volume V\nhas three distinct roots when the temperature is below its critical value Tc . Amongst\nthese three roots, the intermediate root corresponds to a point at which (\u2202P/\u2202V )T >\n0. Hence, this root is unstable, since the pressure increases with volume for fixed\ntemperature. It follows that one of the remaining two roots should correspond to thermal\nequilibrium. To ascertain which of the two roots is stable, we recall that the condition\nfor stability is determined by the minimisation of the free energy. If we let G(T, P )\ndenote the Gibbs free energy, then Maxwell's relation V = (\u2202G/\u2202P )T implies that\nZ P\nG(T, P ) = G(T, P0 ) +\nV (u, T )du.\n(116)\nTm =\n\nP0\n\nTherefore, when viewed as a function of pressure P for a fixed temperature T < Tc\nbelow the critical point, the free energy G(T, P ) describes one of two distinct curves,\n\n\f20\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nV\nVv\n\nVl\nP2\n\nP\n\nG\n\nP\nFigure 4. Isothermal curve and equal area law in the pressure-volume plane (above),\nand pressure dependence of the Gibbs free energy (below). As the pressure P of the gas\nis slowly increased, the Gibbs free energy G(P ) increases along the thick solid line in\nthe lower diagram, until P reaches the coexisting pressure P2 . The gas then undergoes\na phase transition and condenses. During this transition the volume changes from\nVv to Vl , at which point the entire system enters the liquid phase. The value of the\ncoexisting pressure P2 is determined by Maxwell's equal area law.\n\ndepending on whether P is reduced from high values or increased from low values.

At the point\nP = P2 the liquid and vapour phases coexist. Therefore, if we, say, reduce the pressure\nfrom high values, then after reaching the value P2 the pressure remains constant until the\nliquid is entirely converted into vapour. During this transition the volume changes from\nVl to Vv as indicated in Figure 4. The value of the coexisting pressure P2 is determined,\nfor each fixed T < Tc , by Maxwell's equal area principle. That is, the vertical line in\nFigure 4 is chosen so that the volumes of the two shaded regions are exactly equal.\n3.2. Canonical partition function\nThe equation of state (108) was first deduced empirically by van der Waals, directly\nfrom experimental observations. However, it can also be derived analytically from the\ncanonical partition function associated with an empirically postulated intermolecular\npotential.

Clearly, \u03c6(d) = 0 and \u03c6(r) assumes its minimum value at r = r0 . As we\n\n\f22\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nsee from Figure 5, this inter-molecular potential energy gives rise to a weak long-range\nattractive force and a strong short-range repulsive force between each pair of molecules.\nThe canonical partition function can thus be written as\nZ\nN Z\nN\n\u0010\nX\nX \u0011\np2i\n1 Y\n3\n3\nd\np\nd\nr\nexp\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u03c6ij , (118)\nz(\u03b2, V ) =\ni\ni\nN!h3N i=1\n2m\ni=1\n(ij)\n\nwhere \u03c6ij = \u03c6(rij ), with rij denoting the distance between the ith and jth molecules.\nThus, the canonical partition function can be expressed as a product\nz(\u03b2, V ) = z0 (\u03b2, V )Q(\u03b2, V ),\n\n(119)\n\nwhere z0 (\u03b2, V ) is the canonical partition function for the ideal gas (95) and\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\nX \u0011\n1\n3\nQ(\u03b2, V ) = N\nd r1 * * * d3 rN exp \u2212 \u03b2\n\u03c6ij\nV\n\n(120)\n\n(ij)\n\nis the contribution from the interaction energy.\nNow, as an approximation to the Lennard-Jones potential we assume that\nexp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c6ij ) = 0 for rij < d. In other words, we regard the molecules as hard spheres\nof radius d, which cannot overlap. As a consequence, the overlapping region can be\nremoved from the range of the volume integration (120). Defining the so-called Mayer\nfunction fij = f (rij ) by\nfij = exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c6ij ) \u2212 1,\n\n(121)\n\nwe rewrite the integral (120) as\nZ\nZ\nY\n1\n3\nd r1 * * *\nd3 rN\n(1 + fij )\nQ(\u03b2, V ) = N\nV\nr1 >d\nrN >d\n(ij)\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nXX\n1\n3\n= N\nd r1 * * *\nd3 rN 1 +\nfij +\nfij fkl + * * * .\nV\nr1 >d\nrN >d\n(ij)\n\n(122)\n\n(ij) (kl)\n\nAssuming that the parameter \u03c60 in (117) is sufficiently small, the contribution arising\nfrom fij in the specified integration range can be regarded as an infinitesimal. The first\nterm on the right side of (122), i.e. the integral of unity, can, on the other hand, be\napproximated by\nV (V \u2212 v0 ) * * * [V \u2212 (N \u2212 2)v0 ][V \u2212 (N \u2212 1)v0 ] \u2248 (V \u2212 bN)N ,\n\n(123)\n\nwhere we put v0 = 2b = 34 \u03c0d3 .

Critical behaviour of the van der Waals gas\nFrom the expression for the partition function of the canonical distribution we deduce\nthe equation of state\n\u0012\n\u0013\nNkB T\nN2\n1 \u2202 ln z(\u03b2, V )\n=\n\u2212a 2,\n(128)\nP =\n\u03b2\n\u2202V\nV \u2212 bN\nV\n\u03b2\nwhere for clarity we have substituted \u03b2 = 1/kB T . Observe that this is precisely the van\nder Waals equation introduced in (108). If we had not applied various approximations\nin the derivation of (127), then additional terms of order (N/V )3 and higher would have\nappeared on the right side of (128).\nTo analyse the behaviour of the system near a critical point we introduce the\ndeviation parameters\np = P\u0302 \u2212 1,\n\nv = V\u0302 \u2212 1,\n\nand t = T\u0302 \u2212 1.\n\n(129)\n\nIn terms of these shifted variables the equation of state (128) becomes\np=\n\n3\n8(t + 1)\n\u2212\n\u2212 1.\n3v + 2\n(v + 1)2\n\n(130)\n\nWe can then expand the equation of state (130) for small v and t, obtaining\np = t(4 \u2212 6v) \u2212 32 v 3 + * * * .\n\n(131)\n\nSimilarly the Gibbs free energy\nG = P V \u2212 kB T ln z(T, V )\ncan be expanded as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\ni\n2\u03c0mkB T\n2\n3 4\n3\nG = Pc Vc (p \u2212 4t)v + 3tv + 8 v + 1 + p \u2212 2 NkB T ln\n.\nh2\n\n(132)\n\n(133)\n\nFor fixed pressure p and temperature t, the volume v in thermal equilibrium is that\nwhich minimises the Gibbs free energy G. The equation of state (131) is a necessary\nbut not sufficient condition for the Gibbs free energy to assume its minimum. Therefore,\n\n\f24\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nat the coexisting pressure p = 4t below the critical temperature (t < 0) we have the\nthree roots\n\u221a\n(134)\nv = \u00b12 \u2212t, 0\nfor the volume determined by the equation of state (131). Differentiating (133) with\n\u221a\nrespect to v, we find that the first two roots \u00b12 \u2212t minimise the free energy G and\nthus correspond to stable states, while the root v = 0 maximises G and thus corresponds\nto an unstable state. Stable states represent the coexisting phase of liquid and vapour,\nwith pressure given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nTc \u2212 T\n.\n(135)\nP2 = Pc (1 + 4t) = Pc 1 \u2212 4\nTc\nThe liquid phase is more stable when P2 < P < Pc , and the vapour phase more stable\nwhen P < P2 .\n3.4. The thermodynamic limit\nThe existence of the instability in the van der Waals system studied above is related\nto the fact that in the canonical distribution the volume V of the system is held fixed,\nwhereas in a real gas volume fluctuations are significant in the vicinity of the critical\npoint. In other words, the canonical distribution does not provide a completely accurate\nphysical description of the vapour-liquid equilibrium. Therefore, as in the case of an\nideal gas, we consider the pressure-temperature distribution, with the corresponding\npartition function\nZ\n1 \u221e\nz(\u03b2, V ) exp(\u2212\u03b1V )dV\n(136)\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\nb bN\n\nwherein the volume fluctuation is integrated out. Recall that b = 23 \u03c0d3 represents the\nsmallest volume each molecule can occupy. Hence, the random variable V representing\nthe total volume ranges from bN to infinity. When the canonical partition function\n(127) is substituted into (136), the resulting integral does not admit an elementary\nanalytical expression. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e we can\nimplicitly determine the potential \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) = N \u22121 ln Z(\u03b1, \u03b2) by the method of steepest\ndescent.\nWe proceed as follows. First we write the integrand in (136) as\nexp(\u2212\u03b1V )z(\u03b2, V ) = exp[Ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302)],\nwhere v\u0302 \u2261 V /N and\ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302) = 1 \u2212 \u03b1v\u0302 + ln\n\n\u0014\u0010\n2\u03c0m \u0011 23\n\u03b2h2\n\n(137)\n\u0015\n\n(v\u0302 \u2212 b) +\n\n\u03b2a\n.\nv\u0302\n\n(138)\n\nIn deriving (138) we have used the Stirling formula ln N! \u2243 N ln N \u2212 N. It should be\nevident from (132) that\nG = \u2212\u03b2 \u22121 g(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302)\n\n(139)\n\n\f25\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nis the Gibbs free energy. Also, note that g(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302) must have at least one maximum\nin the range v\u0302 \u2208 [b, \u221e) corresponding to the minimum Gibbs free energy, because\ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302) \u2192 \u2212\u221e in the limits v\u0302 \u2192 b and v\u0302 \u2192 \u221e. The value of v\u0302 at which\ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302) is maximised therefore determines the equation of state (128) for the canonical\ndistribution. However, in the P -T distribution the volume is a random variable, hence\nwe must take its expectation to obtain the equation of state:\n1 \u2202 ln Z(\u03b1, \u03b2)\n,\n(140)\nN\n\u2202\u03b1\nwhere hv\u0302i denotes the expected volume per particle in the P -T distribution characterised\nby the density function Z \u22121 (\u03b1, \u03b2) exp[Ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302)].\nApplying the change of variable V \u2192 v\u0302, the partition function (136) can be written\nin the form\nZ\nN \u221e\nexp [Ng(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302)] dv\u0302.\n(141)\nZ(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\nb b\nRecall that we are interested in the thermodynamic potential per particle in the\nthermodynamic limit:\nhv\u0302i = \u2212\n\n\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) = lim N \u22121 ln Z(\u03b1, \u03b2).\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(142)\n\nUsing the method of steepest descent, we find that \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) in this limit is given by\n\u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2) = g(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0304) = \u2212\u03b1v\u0304 + ln z(\u03b2, v\u0304),\n\n(143)\n\nwhere v\u0304 = v\u0304(\u03b1, \u03b2) is the function of \u03b1 and \u03b2 which maximises g(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302). Since v\u0304\nminimises the Gibbs free energy, it is the solution of the van der Waals equation of\nstate. Although the exact functional form of v\u0304(\u03b1, \u03b2) is not at our disposal owing to the\ncubic nature of the equation of state, we can nonetheless determine the exact expression\nfor the scalar curvature in terms of the variables \u03b2 and v\u0304. Before we proceed, however,\nwe first establish the following result.\nProposition 6 The thermal expectation value of the volume v\u0302 per particle in the P -T\ndistribution is given by v\u0304, that is, hv\u0302i = v\u0304.\nProof. Differentiating (143) and using the chain rule we find\n\u0010\n\u2202 ln z \u0011 \u2202v\u0304\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u2212v\u0304 + \u2212 \u03b1 +\n.\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202v\u0304 \u2202\u03b1\nHowever, by definition v\u0304 maximises g(\u03b1, \u03b2, v\u0302) so that\n\u2202g\n\u2202 ln z\n= \u2212\u03b1 +\n= 0,\n\u2202v\u0304\n\u2202v\u0304\n\n(144)\n\n(145)\n\nand hence\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u2212v\u0304.\n\u2202\u03b1\nOn the other hand, from (140) we have hv\u0302i = \u2212\u2202\u03c8/\u2202\u03b1, and thus hv\u0302i = v\u0304.\n\n(146)\n\u0003\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n26\n\n3.5. Geometry of the van der Waals manifold\nAs we have just indicated, the functional form of v\u0304(\u03b1, \u03b2) is unknown. Nevertheless,\nwe can implicitly determine expressions for \u2202v\u0304/\u2202\u03b1, \u2202v\u0304/\u2202\u03b2, and so on, in the following\nmanner.

Now, consider the total derivative\nof \u03a9:\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03a9\nd\u03a9 =\nd\u03b1 +\nd\u03b2 +\ndv\u0304.\n(148)\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202v\u0304\nSince d\u03a9 = 0 it follows that\n\u0014 . \u0015\n\u0014 . \u0015\n\u2202\u03a9 \u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03a9 \u2202\u03a9\nd\u03b1 \u2212\nd\u03b2\ndv\u0304 = \u2212\n\u2202\u03b1 \u2202v\u0304\n\u2202\u03b2 \u2202v\u0304\n\u0010 \u2202v\u0304 \u0011\n\u0010 \u2202v\u0304 \u0011\n=\nd\u03b1 +\nd\u03b2,\n(149)\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2 \u03b1\nwhere we have used the general identity:\n\u0010 \u2202\u03b1 \u0011 \u0010 \u2202\u03b2 \u0011 \u0010 \u2202\u03b3 \u0011\n= \u22121.\n(150)\n\u2202\u03b2 \u03b3 \u2202\u03b3 \u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 \u03b2\nOn the other hand, from (147) we have the relations\n\u2202\u03a9\n= 1,\n\u2202\u03b1\n\n\u2202\u03a9\na\n= 2,\n\u2202\u03b2\nv\u0304\n\nand\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n1\n2a\u03b2\n=\n\u2212\n.\n\u2202v\u0304\n(v\u0304 \u2212 b)2\nv\u0304 3\n\n(151)\n\nTherefore, substituting these into (149) we deduce that\n\u2202v\u0304\n1\n=\n\u2202\u03b1\nD\nwhere D is defined by\nD(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n\nand\n\n\u2202v\u0304\n1 a\n=\n,\n\u2202\u03b2\nD v\u0304 2\n\n1\n2a\u03b2\n\u2212\n.\n3\nv\u0304\n(v\u0304 \u2212 b)2\n\n(152)\n\n(153)\n\nThe derivatives of v\u0304 with respect to the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are required in order\nto determine the components of the Fisher-Rao metric on the van der Waals manifold.\nSpecifically we obtain the following result:\nProposition 7 In terms of the pressure-temperature coordinates (\u03b1, \u03b2) the Fisher-Rao\nmetric on the van der Waals manifold is given by\n!\n1\n\u22121\n\u2212a/v\u0304 2\n.\n(154)\nGij =\n3 \u22122\n\u03b2 \u2212 (a/v\u0304 2 )2\n\u2212a/v\u0304 2\nD\n2\nIn particular, in the ideal gas limit a \u2192 0 and b \u2192 0, the metric (154) reduces to the\nmetric (99) for the ideal gas.\n\n\f27\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\nP\n\nPc\n\nT>Tc\nT=Tc\nT<Tc\nUnphysical\nVc\n\nMaxwell's curve\nSpinodal curve\n\nV\n\nFigure 6. Schematic illustration of equations of state for van der Waals gas. The\nscalar curvature on the parameter space diverges along the spinodal boundary which\nenvelopes the unphysical region. The critical point is that where the spinodal curve is\ntangent to the Maxwell equal area boundary. The divergence of the curvature along\nthe spinodal boundary may be interpreted as 'preventing', in some sense, entry into\nthe unphysical domain in the phase diagram.\n\nProof. The components of the metric are determined by the matrix \u2202i \u2202j \u03c8(\u03b1, \u03b2).\nWe have, in Proposition 6, established that \u2202\u03c8/\u2202\u03b1 = \u2212v\u0304, and, using (145),we have\n\u2202v\u0304\n\u2202 ln z \u2202v\u0304 \u2202 ln z\n\u2202 ln z\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u2212\u03b1\n+\n+\n=\n,\n(155)\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202v\u0304 \u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\nTherefore, we obtain\n\u22022\u03c8\n\u2202v\u0304\n\u22022\u03c8\n\u2202v\u0304\n\u22022\u03c8\n\u2202 2 ln z \u2202 2 ln z \u2202v\u0304\n=\u2212 ,\n=\u2212 ,\nand\n=\n+\n,\n(156)\n\u2202\u03b12\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b1\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2 2\n\u2202\u03b2 2\n\u2202\u03b2\u2202v\u0304 \u2202\u03b2\nwhence the desired expression for the metric follows from the formula (127) for the\ncanonical partition function. In the ideal gas limit a \u2192 0 and b \u2192 0, we have D \u2192 v\u0304.\nHowever, from the ideal gas equation of state we have v\u0304 = \u03b1\u22121 , hence we recover (99)\nat once in this limit.\n\u0003\nTo describe the geometry of the van der Waals gas it will be convenient to introduce\nthe concept of a spinodal curve. In general a spinodal curve consists of the points in\nthe thermodynamic phase space at which the second derivative of the free energy with\nrespect to an order parameter vanishes. For a gas of interacting molecules, the mean\nvolume v\u0304 constitutes the order parameter of the system, and the vanishing of the second\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n28\n\nderivative of ln z(\u03b2, v\u0304) with respect to v\u0304 thus determines the spinodal curve in the phase\ndiagram. For the van der Waals gas, by (145), we have the relation\n\u2202 2 ln z\n\u2202\u03b1\n=\u2212\n=0\n(157)\n\u2202v\u0304\n\u2202v\u0304 2\nthat determines the spinodal curve. In other words, the locus of points at which the\nderivative of pressure with respect to volume vanishes for some temperature determines\nthe spinodal curve. This is schematically illustrated for the van der Waals equation in\nFigure 6.\nIt is evident from Figure 6 that the region in the phase diagram enveloped by\nthe spinodal curve is unstable because (\u2202P/\u2202V )T > 0 in this region, i.e. the pressure\nincreases with increasing volume. The spinodal curve thus forms the boundary of a\nsemi-stable region in the phase diagram. In view of the first relation in (152), the\nspinodal curve is determined by the condition D = 0. On the other hand, from the\nexpression (154) for the Fisher-Rao metric on the van der Waals manifold we see that\neach component of the metric Gij as well as its determinant \u22123/(2\u03b2 2D) is singular\nalong the spinodal curve. Is this singular behaviour merely due to the specific choice of\ncoordinates or is it an intrinsic feature of the van der Waals manifold? We can answer\nthis question by calculating the scalar curvature of the manifold. The exact expression\nfor the curvature is as follows.\nProposition 8 The scalar curvature of the van der Waals manifold is given by\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\na\u03b2\na\u03b2\n4\n\u2212D .\n(158)\nR=\n3D 2 v\u0304\nv\u0304 3\nIn particular, R diverges along the entire spinodal curve specified by D = 0, which\nincludes the critical point (Pc , Vc , Tc ). The scalar curvature vanishes in the ideal gas\nlimit for which a \u2192 0 and b \u2192 0.\nProof. Since we have chosen the canonical parametrisation (\u03b1, \u03b2), we can use\nthe determinant in (48) to calculate the curvature. To compute the entries in the\ndeterminant we differentiate (156) and use the chain rule, together with (152), thereby\nobtaining\n2 \u0010\n1\na\u03b2 \u0011\na\n2a\n\u03c8111 = 3\n\u2212\n3\n\u2261\nX,\n\u03c8\n=\nX\n+\n112\nD (v\u0304 \u2212 b)3\nv\u0304 4\nv\u0304 2\nv\u0304D 2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4\na3\n6\n3\na2\n,\n\u03c8\n=\nX+\n\u2212 3.\n(159)\n\u03c8122 = 4 X +\n222\n2\n6\n2\nv\u0304\nv\u0304D\nv\u0304\nv\u0304D\n\u03b2\nSubstituting these results into (48) we obtain, after some algebra, the desired expression\nin (158). The fact that the curvature diverges along the spinodal curve D = 0 is evident\nfrom the expression (158). Also, from the definition (157) of the spinodal curve and\nthe condition (110) for the critical point, it is clear that the critical point lies on the\nspinodal curve. The vanishing of the curvature in the ideal gas limit a, b \u2192 0 is also\nevident from the expression in (158).\n\u0003\nThe van der Waals manifold possesses the structure of a Riemann surface over a\nplanar base space with coordinates (\u03b1, \u03b2), branched around the singularities specified by\n\n\f29\n\nInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n\u03b2\nvanishing curvature\n(R = 0)\n\nR<0\n\nR>0\n27b\n8a\n\nMaxwell's boundary\nspinodal curve (D = 0)\n\nR<0\n3b\n\nv\n\nFigure 7. Geometric phase diagram for the van der Waals gas. The gas is divided\ninto positive and negative curvature phases by the vanishing curvature R = 0 curve.\nThe change of phase along R = 0 is analytic, while the curvature exhibits singular\nbehaviour along the spinodal curve D = 0.\n\nthe spinodal curve. Now, suppose we slowly change the variables (\u03b1, \u03b2) along a closed\ncontour C in the planar base space. Then, the lifted curve in the van der Waals manifold\ndoes not, in general, return to the same sheet (i.e. to the same thermodynamic state) if C\nencloses the critical point or crosses the spinodal curve, while Maxwell's relation ensures\nthat an infinitesimal closed contour enclosing no singularities is thermodynamically\ntrivial. Thus, the presence of singularities may give rise to changes in the thermodynamic\nstate v\u0304 of the system upon following a closed contour in the parameter base space which\nencloses a point of divergency. Conversely, if a closed contour in the parameter space\ndoes not enclose the critical point or cross the spinodal curve, then the corresponding\ncurve in M is closed and thus gives rise to a well-defined holonomy. This leads naturally\nto the following open problem: What is the physical interpretation or relevance of the\nholonomy (analogue of the geometric phase in quantum mechanics) in classical statistical\nmechanics?\nFinally we note that the scalar curvature R on the van der Waals manifold vanishes\nalong the curve specified by\n\u03b2=\n\nv\u0304 3\n,\na(v\u0304 \u2212 b)2\n\n(160)\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n30\n\nand its sign changes smoothly from positive to negative as one decreases the temperature\nin the (v\u0304, \u03b2) plane. The sign of the scalar curvature in the (v\u0304, \u03b2) plane and its relation\nto the spinodal and Maxwell boundaries are schematically illustrated in Figure 7. One\nmight refer to the smooth change in the sign of the scalar curvature in the phase diagram\nas a geometric phase transition. Unlike the conventional phase transitions associated\nwith singular behaviour, however, such geometric phase transitions are not associated\nwith any divergence. There are indications that the scalar curvature can be viewed\nas a measure of stability of the system. However, the precise correspondence between\nphysical characteristics of the system and properties of the curvature, apart from the\nsingular behaviour along the spinodal boundary, remains an open research problem.\n4. Bibliographical notes\nWhen the first author was invited to write a survey article on a topic of interest, it\nseemed appropriate to utilise this opportunity by briefly reviewing some applications\nof information geometry in physics. This reflects the fact that interest in this area\nhas continued to grow. Two international conferences on applications of information\ngeometry have been held in recent years, while diverse new applications continue to\nemerge-for example, in the area of shape recognition in computer science (Maybank\n2005, Peter & Rangarajan 2006), in connection with out of equilibrium measures\n(Crooks 2007), in the characterisation of quantum phase transitions (Zanardi et al.\n2007), in various mathematical extensions (e.g., Cena & Pistone 2007), or in black\nhole thermodynamics (Ruppeiner 2008). The application of information geometry to\nstatistical physics, however, has generated a vast amount of literature, and it seemed\nneither feasible nor helpful to cover all the results which have emerged in this area. What\nseemed more appropriate was to focus attention upon one specific topic that nevertheless\nincorporates all the essential ingredients. It also appeared desirable to explain the\nbasic ideas of information geometry and its emergence from probabilistic and statistical\nconsiderations in a language accessible to a graduate student in theoretical physics. For\nthese reasons we begin the paper with a some rather elementary background material,\nand then consider its application to the theory of vapour-liquid equilibrium. This leads\nto the analysis of the van der Waals gas model, which, in our opinion, not only embodies\nall the essential features of a phase transition in statistical mechanics but also admits\nan elegant geometric characterisation. To keep the exposition at a fairly elementary\nlevel, we have excluded ad hoc citations from the main text so as to avoid impeding\nthe continuity of the exposition. Instead, references to the literature are presented more\ninformally in these bibliographical notes.\nTo the authors' best knowledge, the use of geometric methods in statistical analysis\nwas first introduced by P. C. Mahalanobis, the founder of the Indian Statistical Institute\nand also the founding editor of Sankhy\u0101 (The Indian Journal of Statistics), in the early\n1930's (Mahalanobis 1930, 1936). Mahalanobis was a physicist and statistician who\ntaught relativity and wrote an introduction to the translation by M. Saha of Minkowski's\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n31\n\nwork on relativity. His articles on relativity, written jointly with S. N. Bose were\npublished by the Calcutta University. He introduced a measure of mutual separation in\nthe study of statistical data arising from anthropometric measurements. An alternative\nmeasure of separation was subsequently introduced by Bhattacharyya (1943, 1946), and\nwas defined in Section 1 as the Bhattacharyya spherical distance between two probability\ndensities.\nThe geometric description of the parameter-space manifold was initiated at around\nthe same time by Rao (1945, 1947, 1954). The seminal paper by Rao (1945) is\nsignificant in two respects: on the one hand, it introduced the so-called Cram\u00e9r-Rao\ninequality as a lower bound for the variance, while on the other hand it pointed out that\nthe information measure introduced previously by Fisher (1925) defines a Riemannian\nmetric on the parameter-space manifold of a statistical model. Rao then proposed\nthe associated geodesic distance as a measure of dissimilarity between probability\ndistributions. The formulation considered by Rao was based on the Hilbert space\n\u221a\nembedding p\u03b8 (x) \u2192 l\u03b8 (x) = p\u03b8 (x). As a consequence, many of the constructions in Rao\n(1945) bear a formal resemblance to the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics,\ndeveloped by physicists some time later in the 1980's and 1990's. Concurrently with\nRao's work on the application of geometry in statistics, Jeffreys (1946) also introduced\nthe concept of uninformative priors based on the use of a Riemannian metric.\nIt is worth noting incidentally that the inner product of probability measures via\nthe square-root embedding was introduced earlier by Hellinger (1909) in connection\nwith unitary invariants of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space. The distance measure\nof Hellinger was subsequently extended by von Neumann and Kakutani (see Kakutani\n1946), who introduced an inner product of probability measures in an abstract measuretheoretic context and applied this to investigate equivalence and orthogonality relations\nbetween product measures. The Kakutani inner product was used by Brody (1971) to\nprovide a simple proof of the Gaussian dichotomy theorem, and has also been extended\nby Bures (1969) in the context of operator algebras.\nInterest in the application of geometrical techniques to statistical inference appear\nto have somewhat diminished subsequently, but reemerged with the appearance of\nEfron's seminal paper (1975) on information loss and statistical curvature. Efron\nconsidered the logarithmic embedding p\u03b8 (x) \u2192 l\u03b8 (x) = ln p\u03b8 (x) and demonstrated that\nin the space of log-likelihood density functions the curvature of the curve l\u03b8 measures\nthe deviation of the density function from the exponential family. Furthermore, the\nsquared statistical curvature was shown to determine the loss of information resulting\nfrom the use of the maximum likelihood estimator for the unknown parameter \u03b8.\nThe work of Efron (1975, 1978)-and to some extent that of \u010cencov (1982) who\nshowed that the Fisher information metric is unique under certain assumptions including\ninvariance-evoked considerable interest in the geometrical approach to asymptotic\ninference and related topics in statistics. Numerous research papers (for example,\nAtkinson & Mitchell 1981), as well as review papers (for example, Kass 1989) and\nmonographs (for example, Amari 1985, Amari et al. 1987, Murray & Rice 1993, and\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n32\n\nAmari & Nagaoka 2000), were subsequently published.\nIn parallel with these developments in statistics, the application of information\ngeometry to the description of the equilibrium properties of thermodynamic systems\nwas considered by a number of authors. One of the initiators was Ingarden (1981),\nwho considered various Banach space embeddings of probability density functions and\ntheir relation to the concepts of entropy and Fisher information, and suggested their\napplication to statistical physics. The works of Ingarden and his collaborators led to\nthe establishment of a Polish School of researchers systematically investigating various\ngeometric aspects of physical systems described by equilibrium distributions. Janyszek\n& Mrugala (1989a), for instance, clarified the relation of the Fisher-Rao geometry to\ncontact geometry (the latter characterises the geometry of Legendre transformations),\nand investigated the physical interpretation of the metric tensor for a system of\ngas molecules characterised by the pressure-temperature distribution. Janyszek &\nMrugala (1989b) calculated the scalar curvatures of the parameter space manifolds of\nthe one-dimensional Ising model in the thermodynamic limit and of the mean-field\nmodel. Janyszek & Mrugala (1990) also extended information geometric analysis to the\ninvestigation of the stability of ideal quantum gases. Some of these ideas were further\nextended by others in the context of various spin models in statistical mechanics (see,\nfor example, Janke et al. 2002, Brody & Ritz 2003, Johnston et al. 2003).\nAn independent line of investigation on the various geometric properties of\nthermodynamic state spaces was initiated by Weinhold (1975) and also by Ruppeiner\n(1979). Weinhold proposed the existence of a metric structure for the thermodynamic\nstate space arising from empirical laws of thermodynamics. This line of thinking, which\nled to the notion of the so-called thermodynamic length, was extended in a variety of\nways by various authors (see, for example, Salamon & Berry 1983, Schl\u00f6gl 1985, Mrugala\net al. 1990).\nRuppeiner went a step further and considered the second derivative of the entropy,\ndiscussed briefly here in Section 1.5, as a Riemannian metric on the thermodynamic\nstate space. The metric considered by Ruppeiner, based upon the Shannon-Wiener\nentropy, agrees with Rao's entropy derivative metric (cf. Rao 1984), and is also related\nto the Fisher-Rao metric through a Legendre transformation. The key idea is that the\nconvexity of entropy implies the positive-definiteness of the associated Hessian matrix,\nwhich can therefore be used to define a Riemannian metric on the thermodynamic\nstate space. The simplest system to consider in this respect is naturally that of a\nnoninteracting gas of classical particles. This was investigated by Ruppeiner (1979), and\nalso by Mijatovi\u0107 et al. (1987). Geometric aspects of various other physical systems have\nalso been investigated along these lines (Ruppeiner 1990, 1991). For a comprehensive\nbibliography on this topic, see the reference list in the review article by Ruppeiner\n(1995).\nIngarden & Tamassy (1993) also applied an entropic measure of divergence to\nexplain the thermodynamic arrow of time. While the infinitesimal form of the\nentropic measure of divergence (relative entropy) gives rise to a Riemannian structure\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n33\n\ncharacterised in general by the Burbea-Rao metric (85), the metrics arising from\nentropies generally possess Finslerian structure. In particular, the Finsler metric arising\nfrom relative entropy is not symmetric. The idea of Ingarden & Tamassy (1993) consists\nin exploiting the lack of symmetry in such metrics to explain the thermodynamic arrow\nof time, without the introduction of dissipation.\nAn important application of information geometry to the properties of\nrenormalisation group flow in statistical physics-motivated in part by the observation\nof Dawid (1975) that Efron's results might be represented more concisely in terms of\nHilbert space geometry-was proposed by Brody (1987). Closely related ideas were\ndeveloped further by O'Connor & Stephens (1993), Dolan (1998), Brody & Ritz (1998),\nand Brody (2000). (See also Di\u00f3si et al. (1984) for an alternative approach to analysis\nof renormalisation group flow using Rao's entropy derivative metric.)\nThe ideas of information geometry have also been extended to the quantum domain\nby replacing the density functions of classical probability theory by density matrices.\nSubstantial work has been done on quantum information geometry (for example, Petz\n& Sudar 1996, Uhlmann 1996, Grasselli & Streater 2001, Petz 2002, Streater 2004,\nJen\u010dov\u00e1 & Petz 2006, Gibilisco & Isola 2007, and Gibilisco et al. 2007), as well as its\napplication to quantum statistical inference (Brody & Hughston 1998, Barndorff-Nielsen\n& Gill 2000).\nTurning more specifically to the subject matter of the present review, as indicated\nabove, the spherical distance (7) representing the dissimilarity of probability densities\nwas introduced by Bhattacharyya (1943), and the concept of a statistical manifold\nrepresented by the metric (23) was introduced by Rao (1945). The uniqueness of the\nEinstein metric on a complex projective space was conjectured by Calabi, and later\nproven by Yau (1977). The implication of this result in quantum mechanics-that the\nsolution to the vacuum Einstein equation in the space of pure quantum states determines\ntransition probabilities-was pointed out to the first author by G. W. Gibbons in the\nlate 1990's. The relevance of the projective space and the associated metric (47) to\nstatistical mechanics was demonstrated by Brody & Hughston (1999).\nThe expression in Proposition 2 for the scalar curvature in terms of the determinant\nof a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, valid for the two-dimensional statistical manifold associated with a\ncanonical density function, is given in Janyszek & Mrugala (1989b). The fact that\nthe statistical manifold associated with the normal density function possesses constant\nnegative curvature, shown in equation (57), was observed by Amari (1982). However,\nthe significance of the scalar curvature (or in fact the Riemann tensor itself) in statistical\nanalysis remains somewhat obscure.\nA survey article by Burbea (1986) deals systematically with expressions for geodesic\ncurves associated with a number of standard density functions used in statistics (see\nalso the article by Rao in Amari et al. 1987). This includes, in particular, the distance\nbetween Gaussian density functions as given in (69) and (71). Analogous results for\ngamma-distributed densities have been calculated in some detail by Burbea et al. (2002).\nThe fact that the leading order term in the Taylor expansion of the relative entropy\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n34\n\nof a neighbouring pair of parametric density functions gives rise to the Fisher-Rao metric\nwas observed by Ingarden (1981). A more detailed and thorough analysis was given by\nBurbea & Rao (1984), and constitutes the basis for the discussion in Section 1.5. The\nspecific form of entropy defined in (80), sometimes referred to as the \u03b1-order entropy,\nwas introduced by Havrad & Charv\u00e1t (1967) in the context of quantifying classification\nschemes. See also Burbea & Rao (1982a, 1982b) for details concerning various properties\nof this entropy. The use of the \u03b1-order entropy in statistical mechanics has been proposed\nby Tsallis (1988).\nIn Section 2 we considered the information geometry of the pressure-temperature\ndistribution representing the equilibrium state of a gas of noninteracting particles\n(classical ideal gas). The flatness of the information manifold of a classical ideal gas\nwas pointed out by Ruppeiner (1979) using the entropy derivative metric. The solution\nto the associated geodesic equations, in the form expressed in Proposition 5, does not\nseem to appear elsewhere. (An alternative representation of the geodesics appears in\nMijatovi\u0107 et al. 1987.)\nIn Sections 3.1\u223c3.4 we have provided a brief account of the classical theory of the\nvan der Waals gas, as a background for the subsequent geometric description. Our\nexposition follows closely the classic treatise of Mayer & Mayer (1940). There is a series\nof inspiring papers by Kac et al. (1963), Uhlenbeck et al. (1963), Hemmer et al. (1964),\nand also Hemmer (1964), analysing the vapour-liquid equilibrium of the van der Waals\ngas in great detail. These papers extend the earlier work of Kac (1959), which provides\na method for determining the partition function of interacting gas molecules.\nOther related work on systems of interacting gas molecules includes the following:\nTonks (1936) determined the equations of state for gases composed of hard elastic\nspheres with finite radius. Van Hove (1950) calculated the free energy of a system\nof molecules with nonvanishing incompressible radii, interacting according to a finite\nrange force. He showed that in one dimension the system exhibits no phase transition.\nLebowitz & Percus (1963) studied the properties of the correlation functions. Van\nKampen (1964) showed that a gas of molecules with hard sphere repulsive forces and\nlong-range attractive interactions exhibits condensation, and calculated the density\nfluctuations. Rigourous bounds for the free energy of the van der Waals gas were\nderived by Lebowitz & Penrose (1966).\nDetailed analyses of the curvature of some of these classical systems of interacting\nmolecules were presented by Ruppeiner & Chance (1990). The geometry of the van der\nWaals gas associated with the entropy derivative metric is considered in papers by Di\u00f3si\n& Luk\u00e1cs (1986) and in Di\u00f3si et al. (1989), wherein the authors determine the scalar\ncurvature using the density and temperature as coordinates. Using these coordinates,\nthey have also shown that on this statistical manifold there exists no solution to the\nKilling equations (i.e. no vector field such that the associated flow preserves geodesic\ndistances).\nThe description of the geometry of the van der Waals manifold presented in\nSection 3.5 follows closely the analysis outlined by Janyszek (1990) and also by Brody\n\n\fInformation geometry in vapour-liquid equilibrium\n\n35\n\n& Rivier (1995). In particular, the expressions for the metric tensor in Proposition 7\nand for the scalar curvature in Proposition 8 were derived by Brody & Rivier (1995),\nwho also suggested that the curvature of the statistical manifold might play a role in\nstatistical mechanics analogous to that of geometric phases in quantum mechanics. This\nremains an open issue, although recent work on quantum phase transitions indicate that\nthere is indeed a close analogy between these two concepts.\nFinally, the present authors regret that owing to the huge volume of literature on\nthis subject there are many other valuable contributions which have not been mentioned\nin these brief biographical notes.\n[1] Amari, S.
