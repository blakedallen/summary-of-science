If we pack the plane using discs of the same radius, then the only\npossible compact packing is the triangular lattice in which each disc is surrounded by six\ndiscs tangent to it. In this paper we ask what compact packings are possible if we pack\nthe plane using discs of radius 1 and r with r < 1. We do not impose any condition on\nthe relative number of discs of the two radii except to require that discs of both sizes be\npresent. We will prove that there are only nine values of r for which a compact packing\nis possible. For these values we describe the possible compact packings.\nThe nine values of r which allow compact packings are given in table 1. Examples\nof compact packings for each of the nine values are given in figures 1 to 9. Compact\npackings for seven of the nine possible values of r (all but c2 and c5 ) appear in L. Fejes\nT\u00f3th's classic book [3] and in [7, 9]. A packing with r = c5 appears in [8].\n\nc1\nc2\nc3\nc4\nc5\nc6\nc7\nc8\nc9\n\ndecimal\nexact\n0.6375559772\nr 4 \u2212 10r 2 \u2212 8r + 9 = 0\n0.5451510421\nP (r) = 0\n3\n2\n0.5332964167\n8r + 3r\u221a\n\u2212 2r \u2212 1 = 0\n0.4142135624\n2\u2212\np1 \u221a\n\u221a\n0.3861061049 [2 3 + 1 \u2212 2 1 + 3]/3\n0.3491981862 sin(\u03c0/12)/(1\n\u2212 sin(\u03c0/12))\n\u221a\n0.2807764064\n( \u221a17 \u2212 3)/4\n0.1547005384\n2 3/3\u221a\n\u22121\n0.1010205144\n5\u22122 6\n\nijk\n320\n221\n140\n400\n122\n041\n220\n300\n121\n\nsequence\n1111r\n111rr\n1r1r1\n1111\n1rrr1\n1rr1r\n111r\n111\n11rr\n\nTable 1: The nine values of r for which a compact packing using discs of radius 1 and r\nis possible. The decimal expressions are of course approximations. For six values of r we\ngive an explicit exact expression. For the other three\n\u221a 3 which\u221ahave2 ci\n\u221a we4 give polynomials\nas a root.\u221aIn particular, c2 is a root of P (r) = (7 + 4 3)r + (20 + 12 3)r + (6 + 4 3)r +\n(\u221220 \u2212 4 3)r + 3. The last two columns give information on the sequence of discs that\ncan appear around a small disc. These two columns are explained in later sections.\nAn interesting question is to find (for each r) the densest packing of the plane using\ndiscs of radius 1 and r. For six of the above values of r (c1 , c3 , c4 , c6 , c7 , c8 ), Heppes has\nproved that the densest packing is a compact packing [5, 6]. We expect that for the other\nthree values of r the densest packing is also a compact packing. Rigorous bounds on the\ndensest packing may be found in [1, 4], and a non-rigorous study is in [8].\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: A compact packing with r = c1 = 0.6375559772 * * *. r is a root of r 4 \u2212 10r 2 \u2212\n8r + 9.\n\n2\n\nValues of r that allow compact packings\n\nTheorem 1 The nine values of r given in table 1 are the only values in (0, 1) for which\nthere exists a compact packing of the plane using discs of radius r and 1.\nThis section is devoted to the proof of this theorem. The idea is simple. Consider the\ncenter of some disc and the angles that are formed by drawing line segments from the\ncenter of the disc to the centers of the discs that are tangent to the original disc. There\nare only a few possible values for these angles and they are functions of r. The sum of\nthe angles around the center must be 2\u03c0, and this constrains r.\nTo begin the proof, consider three discs that are tangent to each other and the angles\nin the triangle whose vertices are their centers. If all three discs have radius 1 or all three\nhave radius r, then the angles are all \u03c0/3. If two of the discs have radius 1 and one has\nradius r, then the triangle has one angle of \u03b1 and two of \u03b1\u2032 where\ncos(\u03b1\u2032 ) =\n\n1\n,\n1+r\n\n\u03b1 = \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b1\u2032\n\n(1)\n\nIf two of the discs have radius r and one has radius 1, then the triangle has one angle of\n\u03b2 and two of \u03b2 \u2032 where\nr\ncos(\u03b2 \u2032 ) =\n, \u03b2 = \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u2032\n(2)\n1+r\n3\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 2:\u221aA compact packing\nwith r = c2 \u221a\n= 0.5451510421 * * *. r is a root of (7 + 4 3)r 4 +\n\u221a\n(20 + 12 3)r 3 + (6 + 4 3)r 2 + (\u221220 \u2212 4 3)r + 3.\nThus in a compact packing the angles around a disc of radius r can only be \u03c0/3, \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 \u2032 . And the angles around a disc of radius 1 can only be \u03c0/3, \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2. Since the angles\naround a disc must sum to 2\u03c0, there must exist non-negative integers i, j, k such that\ni\u03b1 + j\u03b2 \u2032 + k\u03c0/3 = 2\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nand non-negative integers l, m, n such that\nl\u03b1\u2032 + m\u03b2 + n\u03c0/3 = 2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nFor every value of r there is a trivial solution of both of these equations, namely i = j =\nl = m = 0, k = n = 6. In a compact packing that contains discs of both radii, there must\nbe at least one pair of discs of different radii that are tangent, and so there must be at\nleast one solution of (3) other than the trivial one and at least one solution of (4) other\nthan the trivial one. We start by determining when (3) has solutions.\nDefine\nFijk (r) = i\u03b1 + j\u03b2 \u2032 + k\u03c0/3\n(5)\nEquations (1) and (2) imply that \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2032 are decreasing functions of r, and so Fijk (r) is\nalso decreasing for each choice of ijk. This implies that for each choice of ijk there is at\nmost one value of r for which Fijk (r) = 2\u03c0.\nAs r goes to zero, \u03b1 converges to \u03c0 and \u03b2 \u2032 converges to \u03c0/2. So\nlim Fijk (r) = i\u03c0 + j\u03c0/2 + k\u03c0/3\n\nr\u21920\n\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fFigure 3: A compact packing with r = c3 = 0.5332964167 * * *. r is a root of 8r 3 + 3r 2 \u2212\n2r \u2212 1.\nAnd when r = 1 all the angles are \u03c0/3, so\nFijk (1) = (i + j + k)\u03c0/3\n\n(7)\n\nSo there is an r \u2208 (0, 1) with Fijk (r) = 2\u03c0 if and only if we have 6i + 3j + 2k > 12 and\ni + j + k < 6. Thus there are only a finite number of i, j, k for which eq. (3) might\nhave a solution. There are further constraints on i, j, k. Recall that the sides adjacent\nto the angle \u03b1 both have length 1 + r, the sides adjacent to \u03b2 have lengths 1 + r and\n2r and the sides adjacent to \u03c0/3 both have length 2r. This implies that j must be\neven, and if j equals zero, then one of i and k must be zero. It is now trivial to check\nthat the only possibilities for ijk are the nine listed in the next to last column of the\ntable and one additional case, i = 5, j = 0, k = 0. For this last case, Fijk (r) = 2\u03c0 at\nr = (1 \u2212 sin(\u03c0/5))/ sin(\u03c0/5) = 0.7013025284 * * *.\nThe case of r = (1 \u2212 sin(\u03c0/5))/ sin(\u03c0/5) can be ruled out by considering eq. (4). We\ncompute \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2 and check if (4) is satisfied for any choice of l, m, n. We find that it is\nnot. Thus the only r which might allow compact packings are those shown in the table.\nThe explicit packings shown in figure 1 to 9 show that compact packings with these nine\nvalues of r are indeed possible. It is straightforward to use the figures to compute the\nnine values of r given in the table. This completes the proof of theorem 1.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 4: A compact packing with r = c4 = 0.4142135624 * * * =\n\n3\n\n\u221a\n\n2 \u2212 1.\n\nThe compact packings\n\nIn this section we will describe the possible compact packings for r = c1 to c9 . It will\nbe helpful to put eqs. (3) and (4) in a slightly different form. Consider the triangle\nformed by the centers of discs with radii r1 , r2 , r3 which are tangent to each other. Let\n\u03b8(r1 , r2 , r3 ) denote the angle at the center of the disc of radius r1 . Depending on the\nvalues of r1 , r2 , r3 , \u03b8(r1 , r2 , r3 ) is either \u03c0/3, \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032, \u03b2 or \u03b2 \u2032 . Now let D be a disc with radius\nr0 and let D1 , D2 , * * * Dn be the discs that are tangent to D and such that Di is tangent\nto Di+1 . Let r1 , r2 , * * * , rn be their radii. Then we must have\nn\nX\n\n\u03b8(r0 , ri , ri+1 ) = 2\u03c0\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere rn+1 = r1 . Of course each ri is either 1 or r. So for r0 equal to 1 or r, we want to\nfind all finite sequences r1 , r2 , * * * , rn consisting of 1's and r's such that the above equation\nis satisfied. (As we noted before, we seek solutions beyond the trivial ones with n = 6\nand r1 = * * * = r6 = r0 which are solutions for all r.)\nWe will write the cases for which (8) is satisfied in the form\nr0 : r1 r2 r3 * * * rn\n\n(9)\n\nmeaning that a disc of radius r0 can be surrounded by a sequence of discs of radius\nr1 , r2 , * * * , rn . Of course, if r0 : r1 r2 r3 * * * rn is possible then so is r0 : rn rn\u22121 rn\u22122 * * * r1 as\n6\n\n\fb\nf\n\na c\ne d g\ni h\nm\n\nj\nk\n\nl\n\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\nFigure 5: A compact packing with r = c5 = [2 3 + 1 \u2212 2 1 + 3]/3 = 0.3861061049 * * *.\nwell as any cyclic permutation of r1 r2 r3 * * * rn . We will only list one possibility from each\nequivalence class. We will refer to (9) as a \"sequence for small discs\" when r0 = r and as\na \"sequence for large discs\" when r0 = 1. When there is only one possible sequence up to\nthe symmetries just described, we will say the sequence is unique.\nWe have already determined the solutions of eq. (3) and thus the solutions of (8) with\nr0 = r. For each of the nine values of r there are two possible sequences, r : rrrrrr and\nthe sequence given in the last column of the table. We will argue that r : rrrrrr does\nnot occur except when r = c5 . Suppose the configuration contains at least one small disc\nwith sequence rrrrrr. Consider the small discs that are tangent to at least one small\ndisc with sequence rrrrrr. They cannot all have sequence rrrrrr. So there is at least\none small disc D whose sequence is not rrrrrr but which is tangent to a small disc with\nsequence rrrrrr. This implies that the sequence for D must contain rrr but not be equal\nto rrrrrr. So it must contain 1rrr or rrr1. From the table we see that this is possible\nonly for r = c5 .\nFinding the possible solutions of (8) with r0 = 1 is straightforward. For each of the\nnine values of r we compute \u03b1\u2032 and \u03b2 and check for what choices of r1 , r2 , * * * , rn eq. (8)\nis satisfied with r0 = 1. We will list the possibilities as we consider each of the nine values\nof r.\nFor some values of r we can give very explicit descriptions of all possible compact\npackings, but for others we can only show that there is a correspondence between packings\nand tilings using certain polygons. The order in which we will consider the nine values of\nr is for the sake of exposition. We start with the only value of r for which the packing\n7\n\n\fd\nc b\na\n\ne\nf h\ng\nj\n\ni\n\nFigure 6: The compact packing with r = c6 = sin(\u03c0/12)/(1 \u2212 sin(\u03c0/12)) =\n0.3491981862 * * *.\nis unique. Of course, we can translate, rotate and reflect any compact packing to get\nanother compact packing. When we say unique we implicitly mean unique up to these\nsymmetries. Throughout the arguments that follow we will freely use these symmetries to\nassume, for example, that a certain feature of the configuration is oriented in a particular\ndirection.\nFor the next three values of r, the compact configurations are obtained by starting\nwith a triangular lattice of large discs and either replacing some of the discs by groups of\nsmall discs (r = c5 ) or filling in some of the holes with small discs (r = c8 , c9 ). For the\nnext three values, c4 , c7 , c2 , we can only show that there is a one to one correspondence\nbetween compact packings and tilings of the plane with polygons whose sides all have\nlength 2. For the last two values, c1 , c3 , we show that the packing is made of layers, but\nfor each layer there is a two-fold choice.\nPossible packings for r = c6 :\nThere is a unique sequence for small discs and apriori two possible sequences for large\ndiscs.\nr : 1rr1r\n1 : rrrrrrrrrrrr or\n\n111111\n\n(10)\n\nWe will argue that the 1 : 111111 sequence does not appear. The argument is similar to\nthe argument used to rule out r : rrrrrr. If 1 : 111111 appears, then there must be a large\n8\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 7: A compact packing with r = c7 = ( 17 \u2212 3)/4 = 0.2807764064 * * *.\ndisc D whose sequence is not 111111 but which is tangent to a large disc with sequence\n111111. So the sequence of D must contain 111 but not equal 111111. This contradicts\nthe above possible sequences around a large disc. Thus the only possible sequence around\na large disc is rrrrrrrrrrr.\nWe will show that these unique sequences imply the configuration is unique. We\nstart with a large disc which we label a in figure 6. By the sequence for large discs it\nis surrounded by 12 small discs. Consider the small disc labeled b in the figure. Up to\nsymmetry, there is only one sequence that can surround it. Reflecting the configuration\nif necessary, we can assume that the discs around disc b are as shown in the figure, i.e.,\ndiscs a, c, d, e, f . Applying the sequence for small discs to disc f , we conclude that discs g\nand h must be present. Applying the sequence for small discs to disc g, we conclude that\ndiscs i and j are present. Note that we now have three large discs, a, e and i, forming an\nequilateral triangle, and by the sequence for large discs each of them is surrounded by 12\nsmall discs. We can now repeat this argument to fill out the configuration.\nPossible packings for r = c5 :\nThis is the case for which there are two possible sequences for small discs. For the\npossible sequences for a large disc we give a number after the sequence to indicate the\nnumber of discs around the large disc. (This is just to aid in reading the following.)\nr : 1rrr1 or rrrrrr\n1 : rr11111(7), rrr1r111(8), rrr11r11(8), rr1rr111(8),\nrr11rr11(8), rrrr1r1r1(9), rrr1rr1r1(9), rr1rr1rr1(9), or 111111(6) (11)\n9\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 8: A compact packing with r = c8 = 2 3/3 \u2212 1 = 0.1547005384 * * *.\nIn the packing shown in figure 5 we can replace any hexagonal block of 7 small discs\nby a single large disc. If we replace all such blocks of 7 small discs, then the result will\njust be the triangular packing of large discs. If we start with the triangular packing by\nlarge discs, take a subset of the discs such that no two of them are tangent, and replace\nthe discs in this subset by hexagonal blocks of 7 small discs, then the resulting packing\nwill be compact. We claim that all compact packings can be obtained in this fashion.\nWe begin by showing that every connected component of small discs must consist of\nseven small discs arranged in a hexagon like those in figure 5. A connected component of\nsmall discs must contain a small disc that is tangent to a large disc. We label this disc a\nin figure 5. Since it is tangent to a large disc, there is up to symmetry only one possible\nsequence around it. We can assume the sequence is that shown in the figure, i.e., discs\nb, c, d, e, f . The possible sequences around c, d and e then imply that discs g, h, i, j, m\nmust be present. The possible sequences around h then imply discs k, l must be present.\nThus small discs can only appear as part of a cluster of seven small discs arranged in a\nhexagon and surrounded by six large discs.\nNow we replace every hexagonal block of 7 small discs in our compact configuration\nby a single large disc. The result is a compact configuration with only large discs. The\nonly such configuration is the triangular packing. Thus our original packing is obtained\nby replacing some subset of non-tangent large discs in the triangular packing by large\ndiscs by hexagonal blocks of 7 small discs.\nPossible packings for r = c8 :\n10\n\n\f\u221a\nFigure 9: A compact packing with r = c9 = 5 \u2212 2 6 = 0.1010205144 * * *.\nThere is a unique sequence for small discs,\nr : 111,\n\n(12)\n\nand 13 sequences for large discs which we do not list. They are not needed in the argument.\nThe unique sequence for small discs says that each small disc is surrounded by three\nlarge discs that are tangent to each other. So if we remove the small discs, the configuration will still be compact. Thus we can remove all the small discs from our configuration\nand obtain a compact configuration with only large discs. There is only one such configuration, the triangular one. Thus we have shown that every compact configuration is given\nby putting small discs into some subset of the holes in the triangular lattice configuration\nof large discs. (Equivalently, every compact configuration can be obtained by removing\nsome subset of the small discs from the configuration in figure 8.)\nPossible packings for r = c9 :\nThe sequence for small discs is unique:\nr : 11rr\n\n(13)\n\nWe do not list the 195 possible sequences for large discs. Note that in the configuration\nin figure 9 we have a triangular lattice of large discs with each hole filled with a cluster of\nthree small discs which are tangent to each other. We can remove any of the clusters of\nthree tangent small discs and still have a compact configuration. We will show that any\ncompact configuration can be obtained in this way.\n11\n\n\fFigure 10: A compact packing with r = c4 and the corresponding tiling by squares and\ntriangles.\nStart with a small disc. The sequence for small discs implies it is tangent to two other\nsmall discs which are tangent to each other. The sequence for small discs applied to these\nthree small discs then implies that they sit inside the hole formed by three large discs that\nare tangent to each other. We can remove the three small discs and still have a compact\nconfiguration. Thus we can remove all the small discs and have a compact configuration\nwith only large discs. It must be the triangular lattice configuration. So any compact\nconfiguration is formed by putting clusters of three small discs into some of the holes in\nthe triangular lattice configuration of large discs. (Equivalently, we can form a compact\nconfiguration by removing some subset of the clusters of three small discs from figure 9.)\nPossible packings for r = c4 :\nThere is a unique sequence for small discs and four possible sequences for large discs:\n1 : r1r1111,\n\nr : 1111\nr11r111, r1r1r1r1,\n\nor\n\n111111\n\n(14)\n\nThe sequence for small discs implies that every small disc is surrounded by four large\ndiscs whose vertices form a square with sides of length 2. In the configuration in figure 4\nthese squares tile the plane. However, there are many compact packings in which they do\nnot tile the plane. We will show there is a one to one correspondence between compact\npackings with r = c4 and tilings of the plane using squares with sides of length 2 and\nequilateral triangles with sides of length 2. An example of a packing and the corresponding\ntiling is shown in figure 10.\n12\n\n\fFigure 11: A compact packing with r = c7 and the corresponding tiling by rhombi and\ntriangles.\nGiven a packing, we draw line segments between the centers of any two large discs\nthat are tangent. These line segments, which all have length 2, divide the plane into\nsquares and equilateral triangles. To see this, consider a large disc and the possible\nsequences around it. For the sequence r1r1111, the large disc is a vertex of two adjacent\nsquares and three triangles. For the sequence r11r111, the large disc is again a vertex of\ntwo squares and three triangles, but now the two squares do not share a side. For the\nsequence r1r1r1r1, the large disc is a vertex of four squares. And for the sequence 111111\nthe large disc is a vertex of six triangles. So in each case the center of the large disc is a\nvertex of squares and triangles that fit together to tile the space around the large disc.\nThus the packing can be used to construct a tiling by squares and triangles. Conversely,\ngiven such a tiling, we can construct a compact packing by putting a large disc at the\nvertices of the squares and triangles and then putting a small disc at the center of each\nsquare.\nPossible packings for r = c7 :\nThe sequence for small discs is unique and there are six sequences for larges discs:\nr : 111r\n1 : rr1r1111(8), rr11r111(8), rrr1r1r1r1(10),\nrr1rr1r1r1(10), rr1r1rr1r1(10) or 111111(6)\n\n(15)\n\nThe third of the possibilities for a large disc implies that there is a small disc that is\n13\n\n\fFigure 12: Another compact packing with r = c2 .\ntangent to two other small discs. This contradicts the sequence for small discs. So the\nthird possibility for large discs does not occur.\nThe sequence for small discs implies that each small disc is tangent to one other\nsmall disc and this pair is surrounded by four large discs. The centers of these four large\ndiscs are the\n\u221a vertices of a rhombus whose sides are of length 2 and whose acute angle is\n\u22121 \u22121+ 17\n2 cos ( 4 ). Small discs can only appear as pairs inside such rhombi. In the packing\nshown in figure 7 these rhombi tile the plane.\nThere are many possible compact packings for r = c7 . We claim there is a one\nto one correspondence between compact packings and tilings of the plane using these\nrhombi and equilateral triangles with sides of length 2. An example of a packing and the\ncorresponding tiling is shown in figure 11. Given a packing we construct the tiling by\ndrawing line segments between the centers of any pair of large discs that are tangent to\neach other. To see that this produces a tiling of the plane by rhombi and triangles, we\ncan argue as we did in the case of r = c4 . We consider the possible sequences for a large\ndisc and see that in each case the center of the disc is a vertex of rhombi and triangles\nthat fit together to tile the space around the disc. Given a tiling we construct a packing\nby putting a large disc at each vertex of each triangle and each rhombi. Then we put a\npair of small discs inside each rhombi.\nPossible packings for r = c2 :\nThe sequence for small discs is unique, and there are three possible sequences for large\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 13: Another compact packing with r = c1 .\ndiscs:\nr : 111rr\n1 : rr1r111, r11r11r or\n\n111111\n\n(16)\n\nIn addition to the packing in figure 2, we give a second example in figure 12. As in\nthe previous two cases we will show that the possible compact packings are equivalent\nto a tiling problem. In both of the figures the small discs all appear in clusters of three.\nWe will argue that this property is true in any compact packing. The sequence for small\ndiscs implies that every small disc is tangent to two other small discs which are tangent\nto each other. The sequence for small discs applied to these three small discs then implies\nthat they are surrounded by six large discs. The vertices of these six large disc form a\nsix-sided polygon with sides of length 2. We have drawn one in figure 2.\nWe construct the tilings in the same way as in the previous two cases. We draw a line\nsegment between the centers of any two discs of radius 2 that are tangent. These lines\nform equilateral triangles in addition to the six-sided polygons. The same arguments used\nin the previous cases show that given a packing, the six-sided polygons and triangles tile\nthe plane and conversely, given such a tiling we can construct a compact packing.\nPossible packings for r = c1 :\nThe possible sequences are\nr : 1111r\n1 : r1r1r1r or 111111\n15\n\n(17)\n\n\fs\nq\nn\no\n\nm\n\nb\n\nh\np\n\nr\nc\n\nd\n\na\ng\n\ni\n\nj\n\ne\nf\n\nk\nl\n\nt\n\nFigure 14: Another compact packing with r = c3 .\nStart with a small disc. The unique sequence for small discs implies it touches one other\nsmall disc. By the sequence for small discs, this pair of tangent small discs is surrounded\nby six large discs. The centers of these six large discs are the vertices of a flattened\nhexagon. (An example of the flattened hexagon is shown in figure 1.) We will show that\nthese flattened hexagons tile the plane.\nThe flattened hexagon has two different angles in it which we call \u03b81 and \u03b82 with\n\u03b81 < \u03b82 . We have 4 \u03b81 's and 2 \u03b82 's in the flattened hexagon. The sequence for large discs\nimplies that at every large disc we must have two \u03b81 's and one \u03b82 . It follows that the\nflattened hexagons tile the plane.\nTo determine the possible tilings, we consider two cases. The first case is that all the\nflattened hexagons have the same orientation. The second case is that they do not. It is\neasy to see that in the first case the configuration must be the one shown in figure 1. In\nthe second case there must be two flattened hexagons that share a side but have different\norientations. So we have two flattened hexagons which fit together as shown by the two\nbold hexagons in figure 13. Using the constraint that each large disc has two \u03b81 's and one\n\u03b82 , it follows that all the shaded hexagons must be present, extending to infinity in both\ndirections.\nNext we consider what can happen above and below this shaded layer. Consider\nadding a flattened hexagon with two sides adjacent to the shaded layer. There are two\npossible orientations, but as soon as we add one flattened hexagon, the orientation of\nall the other ones touching this boundary of the shaded region must be the same. In\nthe figure we have added one above the shaded region with the same orientation as the\n16\n\n\fz\nt\ns\n\np\n\nq\n\nc\n\na\n\ng\nn\n\nk\n\nb\n\nh\n\no\n\nr\n\nj\n\ni\n\nm\n\nw\n\nu\n\nd\ne\n\nf\n\nv\n\nl\n\nx\ny\n\nz\n\nFigure 15: Yet another compact packing with r = c3 .\nshaded flattened hexagons along this upper boundary. And below the shaded region we\nhave added one whose orientation is different from the shaded flattened hexagons along\nthe lower boundary. It follows that the configuration must consist of such layers with the\nfreedom to chose an orientation for each layer.\nPossible packings for r = c3 :\nThe sequence for small discs is unique, and there are five possible sequences for large\ndiscs:\n1 : rrr1111,\n\nrrrrr1r1,\n\nr : 1r1r1\nrrrr1rr1,\n\nrrr1rrr1,\n\nor\n\n111111\n\n(18)\n\nWe will show that there are two types of compact configurations for this value of r. Figure\n14 gives an example from the first class. In general, a configuration in this class is formed\nof layers of large discs and layers of small discs (which oscillate up and down slightly\nas in the figure). The only constraint on the sequence of layers is that we cannot have\ntwo adjacent layers of small discs. An example from the second class is shown in figure\n15. These configurations are formed by layers made up of large discs alternating with\ntwo tangent small discs aligned vertically. (For example, the shaded discs in figure 15\nconsist of three layers.) Each layer has two possible locations relative to the layer above\n(or below) it. Note that the configuration in figure 3 belongs to both classes and is the\nonly configuration that does.\nWe start by showing that the sequence 1 : rrrrr1r1 does not occur. Consider the small\ndisc represented by the last r. It touches the large disc at the center of the sequence, and\n17\n\n\fthere are two other larges discs tangent to the small disc and the large disc at the center.\nSo the sequence around the small disc must contain 111 which is not possible. So the\nsequence 1 : rrrrr1r1 does not occur.\nWe now divide into two cases. The first case is that at least one large disc has the\nsequence 1 : rrr1111. The second case is that no large disc has this sequence. We will\nshow that in the first case the configuration is of the first type described above, and in\nthe second case it is of the second type.\nIn figure 14 the large disc that is assumed to have the sequence 1 : rrr1111 is labeled\na. It is surrounded by b, c, d, e, f, g, h. Using the possible sequences, we now have\ne \u21d2 i, j, k, l\nh \u21d2 m, n, o, p\nc\n\u21d2 q, r\n\n(19)\n\nThe large discs e and h are now surrounded by the same sequence that a is. Repeating\nthis argument, we conclude that all of the shaded discs are present. We now consider\nwhat can happen above and below the shaded discs. Consider two large shaded discs that\nare tangent to each other and at the edge of the shaded discs. They must both be tangent\nto a disc that is not shaded. It is either small or large. The case of a small disc is shown\nby s above the shaded discs, and the case of a large disc is shown by t below the shaded\ndiscs. It is now straightforward to show that s forces the layer of small unshaded discs\njust above the shaded discs as well as the layer of large unshaded discs at the top edge of\nthe figure. And the small disc t is easily shown to imply the layer of large unshaded discs\njust below the shaded discs.\nFor the second case we refer to figure 15. In the second case we are assuming that\nthe sequence 1 : rrr1111 does not occur. It is easy to see that this implies that if the\nconfiguration contains at least one small disc, then the sequence 1 : 111111 cannot occur.\nSo the only possible sequences around a large disc are rrrr1rr1 and rrr1rrr1. If the\nsequence rrrr1rr1 never appears, then it is easy to show that the configuration must be\nthat shown in figure 3. So we now assume there is at least one large disc with the sequence\nrrrr1rr1. In figure 15 this disc is labeled a, and the discs surrounding it b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i.\nWe now have\nb\n\u21d2 j, k\ne\n\u21d2 l, m\ng\n\u21d2 n, o\nh\n\u21d2p\no \u21d2 q, r, s, t\nc\n\u21d2u\nu \u21d2 v, w, x, y\n18\n\n\fThis shows that the large discs o and u have the same sequence around them as the large\ndisc a. So we can repeat this argument and conclude that all of the shaded discs must be\npresent.\nWe now ask what can happen above and below the shaded discs in figure 15. The\nlarge disc i must touch one more large disc and one more small disc in addition to the\nshaded discs. There are two possible locations for the additional small disc.\nOne possibility is given by the disc z just above the shaded region, and the other\npossibility by the disc z just below the shaded region. It is now easy to show that the\npresence of the z disc just above the shaded discs forces all of the layer of unshaded discs\nabove the shaded ones. And the presence of z as shown below the shaded discs forces\nthe layer of unshaded discs below the shaded ones. We conclude that the configuration in\nthe second case is made up layers. (In the figure there are three layers with shaded discs\nand single layers above and below them that are unshaded.) Each layer has two possible\nlocations relative to the layer below (or above) it.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation (DMS-0201566).\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
