These\npairs consist of a holomorphic vector bundle on the surface and a meromorphic automorphism of the bundle. The\nsingularities of this automorphism correspond to the singularities of the singular monopole. We then consider the\ncomplex geometry of the moduli space; in particular, we compute dimensions, both from the complex geometric\nand the gauge theoretic point of view.1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a recent paper about the geometric Langlands program, Kapustin and Witten [21] expound the idea that the\nmoduli of singular monopoles on the product of a Riemann surface \u03a3 with an interval should mediate the Hecke\ntransforms which play a part in the geometric Langlands correspondence. A particular case is when the product\nof the transforms gives back the original bundle, and in understanding this relationship, it is then natural to ask\nwhat one gets as a monopole moduli space when one closes the interval to a circle.\nAnother motivation to study monopole moduli spaces on such a product is obtained by specialising to when the\nsurface is a torus. One of the main tools for understanding monopoles, and more generally anti-self-duality, has been\nthe Nahm transform heuristic. It tells us that singular monopoles on T 3 = S 1 \u00d7 T 2 should correspond to instantons\non some \"dual\" R \u00d7 T 3 . (While aspects of this correspondence have been elucidated in [5], the correspondence is\nstill not completely proven.) Thus, even when studying smooth solutions to the anti-self-duality equations, one is\nled to consider configurations with singularities.\nThe monopoles under consideration in this paper are solutions to a generalisation of the Bogomolny equation\nF\u2207 = \u2217d\u2207 \u03c6\nlinking the curvature F\u2207 of a unitary connection \u2207 on a Hermitian bundle E over a Riemannian three-manifold Y\nand an skew-Hermitian endomorphism \u03c6 of E called a Higgs field. The generalisation is the addition, in the special\ncase where Y = S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, of a constant central term:\nF\u2207 \u2212 iCIE \u03c9\u03a3 = \u2217d\u2207 \u03c6.\nWhen Y is compact, global smooth solutions to the standard Bogomolny equation are quite trivial: the connection \u2207 must be flat and \u03c6 must be parallel. Over open manifolds, monopoles and their moduli have been\nextensively studied over the past twenty-five years, beginning with the case of R3 . For R3 , Hitchin in [13] constructed all monopoles for SU(2) using the twistor methods of Penrose, Ward and Atiyah. Using this construction,\nand its natural extension to other gauge groups, the moduli spaces were described in [10; 17; 19]. On hyperbolic\nspace, a similar description was given by Atiyah in [1] (see also [20]). The R3 -spaces have natural metrics [2]; for a\nunified discussion of Euclidean and hyperbolic cases, see [25]. Monopoles on R2 \u00d7 S 1 have been studied in [6] from\nthe perspective of the Nahm transform.\nThe first study of singular monopoles (with Dirac-type singularities) is due to Kronheimer in [22] for Euclidean\nspaces. Pauly computed in [30] the virtual dimension of the moduli space of singular SU(2)-monopoles and in [31]\n1 The authors wishes to thank Tom Mrowka and Mark Stern for useful discussions, and Marco Gualtieri and Paul Norbury for\ncomments on the first two versions of the paper.

More recently, Nash considered in [26] the twistor\ntheory of singular hyperbolic SU(2)-monopoles. Norbury proved in [28] the existence and uniqueness of singular\nmonopoles satisfying prescribed boundary conditions on an interval times a surface. The properties of certain\nmoduli spaces of singular monopoles on R3 and R2 \u00d7 S 1 allowed Cherkis\u2013Kapustin in [8; 9] and Cherkis\u2013Hitchin in\n[7] to produce families of asymptotically locally flat gravitational instantons.\nWe shall restrict our attention in this paper to the gauge group U(n). Our solutions have singularities, and we\nmust fix the nature of the singularity. Fortunately, in our case, there is a fairly natural choice: we ask that near the\nsingularity, the monopole, in essence, should decompose into a sum of Dirac monopoles. These boundary conditions\nwere studied by Pauly [30], who shows, by exploiting the geometry of the Hopf fibration, that there are natural\nlocal lifts from R3 to R4 that tame the singularity.\nThe solutions to the Bogomolny equation we consider thus have Dirac-type singularities at fixed points pi =\n(ti , zi ) \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, where the zi are distinct. The bundle E is defined on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 \\ {p1 , . . . , pN }. Precise definitions\nof the allowed singularities are given below; for the moment, let Ri be the geodesic distance, in S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, to pi .\nOn a small sphere surrounding the singularity pi , the bundle is a sum of\u221aline bundles of degree ki1 , . . . , kin and\nnear the singularity the monopoles will have Higgs field \u03c6 asymptotic to ( \u22121/2Ri )diag(ki1 , . . . , kin ), where ~ki =\n(ki1 , . . . , kin ) is a sequence of integers, ordered so that ki1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 kin . We collect these sequences together as a\nsequence\n\u0001\nK = (~k1 , z1 ), . . . , (~kN , zN ) .\n(1)\nWe also collect the length T of the circle and the circle coordinates ti of the singularities in a vector\n~t = (t1 , . . . , tN , T ).\n\n(2)\n\nDenote by Et the restriction to {t} \u00d7 \u03a3 of the bundle E for t 6= ti . Let the degree of E0 be k0 . As one moves\nP\nP\nthrough the point pi , the degree of Et changes by tr(~ki ) := j kij ; in particular, it must be that i tr(~ki ) = 0.\nAs with other examples of moduli of solutions to the anti-self-duality equations and their reductions, we exploit\nthe fact that the equations decompose into two components. The first component simply states that we are dealing\nwith a holomorphic object; the second is variational in nature, and possesses a unique solution once one has a\nsolution to the first component, as long as the holomorphic object is stable in a suitable sense. This general scheme\noften goes by the name of the Kobayashi\u2013Hitchin correspondence. In our case, we obtain the following theorem.\n1\n~\n~\nTheorem 1.1 The moduli space Mir\nk0 (S \u00d7\u03a3, p1 , . . . , pN , k1 , . . . , kN ) of U(n) irreducible Hermitian\u2013Einstein monopoles\n1\n~\non S \u00d7 \u03a3 with E0 of degree k0 and singularities at pj of type kj maps bijectively to the space Ms (\u03a3, k0 , K, ~t) of\n~t-stable holomorphic pairs (E, \u03c1) with\n\n\u2022 E a holomorphic rank n bundle of degree k0 on \u03a3,\n\u2022 \u03c1 a meromorphic section of Aut(E) of the form Fi (z)diagj ((z \u2212 zi )kij )Gi (z) near zi , with Fi , Gi holomorphic\nP\nand invertible, and such that det(\u03c1) has divisor i tr(~ki )zi .\n\nMore generally, the reducible HE-monopoles correspond bijectively to ~t-polystable, but unstable, pairs.\n\nThe required notions, in particular of stability, are defined below.\nSections two through four of this paper are concerned with the proof of this theorem. The fifth section considers\nsome examples. In the sixth and seventh sections, we use these ideas to consider monopoles on the product of an\ninterval and a Riemann surface and on certain flat circle bundles over Riemann surfaces.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDefinitions\nThe Bogomolny and HE\u2013Bogomolny equations\n\nLet \u03a3 be a Riemann surface, equipped with a Hermitian metric; let z denote a coordinate on \u03a3. Let S 1 be the\ncircle, equipped with metric such that its circumference is T . Let t \u2208 [0, T ] be a coordinate on S 1 , such that the\nS 1 -metric is given by dt2 . We consider the three-fold S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 equipped with the product metric, and as above,\ndenote the submanifolds {t} \u00d7 \u03a3 by \u03a3t . Let p1 , . . . , pN be a collection of points on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3; set pi = (ti , zi ). We\nsuppose that the zi are distinct, and that the ti are ordered t1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 tN . We suppose the ti distinct and the\norigin of the circle chosen so that ti 6= 0. The case where some ti are equal imposes no supplementary conceptual\ndifficulty, but complicates the notation.\n\n\fSingular HE monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface\nP\n\n3\n\nkij = 0. Now let E be a Hermitian vector\nP\nbundle of rank n on (S \u00d7 \u03a3) \\ {p1 , . . . , pN }, with degree k0 on \u03a30 , and degree tr(~ki ) = j kij on small spheres\nsurrounding the pi . Let E be equipped with a unitary connection \u2207 of curvature F\u2207 , and a skew-Hermitian section\n\u03c6 of End(E) called the Higgs field. We say that (E, \u2207, \u03c6) satisfies the Bogomolny equation if\nAs above, we fix integers kij , i = 1, . . . , N, j = 1, . . . , n with\n1\n\nij\n\nF\u2207 = \u2217\u2207\u03c6.\n\n(3)\n\nLet us recall how this equation is a reduction of the anti-self-duality equation in four dimensions. Extend the circle\nto a cylinder S = R \u00d7 S 1 with extra coordinate s, so that w = s + it is a holomorphic coordinate on S. The product\nmetric on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 extends to a product K\u00e4hler metric g on S \u00d7 \u03a3 with K\u00e4hler form \u03a9. Let \u03c0 : S \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 be\n\u02c6 = ( \u2202 + \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c6)ds + \u03c0 \u2217 \u2207. The pair (\u2207, \u03c6) satisfies the Bogomolny equation if and only if\nthe projection, and let \u2207\n\u2202s\n\u02c6\n\u2207 satisfies the anti-self-dual (ASD) equation \u2217F\u2207\n\u02c6 = \u2212F\u2207\n\u02c6 . Another way to phrase this ASD equation more in tune\nwith the complex structure is to split the curvature into bitype, and then to isolate the component \u039bF\u2207 * \u03a9 of the\ncurvature parallel to the K\u00e4hler form \u03a9. The ASD equations become\n0,2\n2,0\nF\u2207\n\u02c6 = 0.\n\u02c6 = 0, F\u2207\n\u02c6 = 0, \u039bF\u2207\n\nThe first two equations simply state that one has a holomorphic object, with a compatible Hermitian structure; the\nthird, \u039bF\u2207\n\u02c6 = 0, is, as we shall see, variational in nature.\nOn a compact complex surface, these equations impose constraints on the first Chern class of the bundle. There\nare more general equations, the Hermitian\u2013Einstein equations, that free us from this constraint. They are\n0,2\n2,0\nF\u2207\n\u02c6 = iCI,\n\u02c6 = 0, F\u2207\n\u02c6 = 0, \u039bF\u2207\n\n(4)\n\nfor an imaginary constant multiple iC of the identity endomorphism. These equations can have non-trivial solutions\non bundles of arbitrary degree.\nIn our case also, we find that the Bogomolny equations impose constraints, this time on the location of the\nsingularities, that are too restrictive for our purposes. Just as the Bogomolny equations are reductions of the ASD\nequations, we have a reduced version of the Hermite\u2013Einstein equation, which we call the Hermitian\u2013Einstein\u2013\nBogomolny equation (or HE\u2013Bogomolny for short).

Let R denotes the\ngeodesic distance to p. Let (t, x, y) be coordinates centred at p for which the metric is in these coordinates of the\nform I + O(R) as R \u2192 0. Let \u03c8, \u03b8 be, as above, angular coordinates on the spheres R = c, so that R, \u03c8, \u03b8 provide\nstandard spherical coordinates on a neighbourhood B 3 of p defined by the inequality R < c. We say that a solution\nto the HE-Bogomolny equations (E, \u2207, \u03c6) on Y \\ {p} has a singularity of Dirac type, with weight ~k = (k1 , . . . , kn )\nat p if\n\u2022 the restriction of the bundle E to B 3 \\ {p} is a sum of line bundles Lk1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lkn , and\n\u2022 one can choose unitary trivialisations of E over the two open subsets \u03b8 6= 0 and \u03b8 6= \u03c0 of B 3 , with transition\nfunction diag(eik1 \u03c8 , . . . , eikn \u03c8 ), as above, in such a way that, in both trivialisations,\ni\ndiag(k1 , . . . , kn ) + O(1),\n2R\n\u2207(R\u03c6) = O(1).\n\u03c6=\n\nA solution to the HE\u2013Bogomolny equations that has singularities of Dirac type is called an HE-monopole.\nThe last condition tells us, via the HE\u2013Bogomolny equations, that the curvature F is O(R\u22122 ).\nAs was first pointed out by Kronheimer [22] for Y = R3 , and expanded upon by [30] for arbitrary three-manifolds,\nthese conditions correspond to the connection matrices and curvature being bounded at the origin (modulo gauge)\nonce they are \"lifted\" to B 4 via the Hopf map\nB4 \u2192 B3\n\n(w1 = u1 + iu2 , w2 = u3 + iu4 ) 7\u2192 (t, x + iy) = (w1 w 1 \u2212 w2 w 2 , 2w1 w2 )\n\n(16)\n\nThis lift is performed as follows: one considers the trivial bundle \u00ca = B 4 \u00d7 Cn equipped with the S 1 -action:\n(w1 , w2 , v1 , . . . , vn ) 7\u2192 (ei\u03b8 w1 , e\u2212i\u03b8 w2 , eik1 \u03b8 v1 , . . . , eikn \u03b8 vn )\n\n(17)\n\nThen the S 1 quotient maps \u00ca to E, covering the map \u03c0 : B 4 \u2192 B 3 . Pauly [30] then shows that one can choose an\nappropriate metric above so that if (1) one defines a connection matrix over B 4 in a lifted trivialisation over the\ncomplement of the origin as the lift \u03c0 \u2217 \u2207 \u2212 \u03be \u2297 \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c6, where \u03be is a suitable one-form on B 4 (in the Euclidean case,\n\u03be = 2(\u2212u2 du1 + u1 du2 \u2212 u4 du3 + u3 du4 )); in the general case, the form is modified by a term of order 2 at the\norigin) and (2) one applies a gauge transformation taking one from S 1 -invariant trivialisations to one defined at the\norigin, one obtains:\nProposition 2.2 The lifting process gives a correspondence between\n\u2022 Solutions to the Bogomolny equations on B 3 \\ {0} with a Dirac type singularity at the origin, with weight ~k.\n\u2022 Anti-self-dual (ASD) connections on \u00ca, invariant under the circle action, smooth away from the origin, and\nrepresented in a gauge in which the action is given as above by a connection matrix which is in L23 (and so is\ncontinuous).\nWe note that the regularity one obtains above translates into O(R\u22121 ) bounds for the connection matrices and for\nthe Higgs field downstairs.\nRemark 2.3 For the Dirac monopole, this process in fact simply has a Dirac monopole correspond to a flat connection upstairs; we note that since a flat connection is anti-self-dual in any metric upstairs, we have (locally) a\nDirac monopole in any metric downstairs.\nWe will return to the HE\u2013Bogomolny equations for this lifting process later on. In the mean time, we note that\nin the case we are considering the metric on B 3 is not generic. Indeed with a coordinate z = x + iy on \u03a3, the metric\non R3 is given by\n(18)\ng = \u03b1(z, z)dzdz + dt2\nOne can choose z centred at the singularity, so that\n\u03b1(z, z) = 1 + zzf (z, z)\n\n(19)\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n6\n\nThe Bogomolny equations for S 1 \u00d7\u03a3 are equivalent to time invariant anti-self-duality equations for S 1 \u00d7S 1 \u00d7\u03a3, with\nthe metric g + ds2 , where s denotes the natural coordinate on the extra circle. This metric is K\u00e4hler with respect\nto the complex structure with complex coordinates s + it, z. One can think of the lifts from B 3 to B 4 in terms of\na \"virtual\" lift from S 1 \u00d7 B 3 to B 4 , with the forms dx, dy, dt lifting in the normal way and ds replaced by \u03be. This\nprocess works quite well, in that the lift preserves bitype for two-forms, the space of (i, j) forms correspond to (i, j)\nforms (when i + j = 2). In particular, if one uses the fact that d\u03be is of type (1, 1), then \"holomorphically integrable\"\nconnections below (that is, satisfying the equation [\u2207x \u2212i\u2207y , \u2207t \u2212i\u03c6] = 0) correspond to holomorphically integrable\nconnections upstairs.\n\n2.4\n\nThe scattering map\n\nDefinition 2.4 Let (E, \u2207, \u03c6) be a solution to the Bogomolny (or HE\u2013Bogomolny) equation on the product I \u00d7 U\nof a interval I with a possibly open Riemann surface U . Let t0 < t1 be two values of t in I. The scattering map\nRt0 ,t1 : E(t0 ,x,y) \u2192 E(t1 ,x,y) is defined by taking for each \u03c30 \u2208 E(t0 ,x,y) , the unique solution \u03c3 of (\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6)\u03c3 = 0 with\n\u03c3(t0 ) = \u03c30 ; one then sets Rt0 ,t1 (\u03c30 ) := \u03c3(t1 ).\n \u0304\nIf (E, \u2207, \u03c6) is an HE-monopole on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, restricting the connection to the surfaces \u03a3t defines a \u2202-operator\n\u22070,1\n\u03a3\n0,1\non the surface, and so gives Et the structure of a holomorphic bundle. Now let t < t\u2032 . The fact that [\u2207\u03a3 , \u2207t \u2212i\u03c6] = 0\nmeans that the scattering map defines a holomorphic isomorphism Rt,t\u2032 from (Et )|U to (Et\u2032 )|U , for U open, as long\nas the set [t, t\u2032 ] \u00d7 U does not contain one of the singular points pi . In particular, for ti < t < t\u2032 < ti+1 , the\nholomorphic bundles on \u03a3t , \u03a3t\u2032 are globally isomorphic.\nWe want also to pass through singularities. To understand what the parallel transport does in that case,\nconsider the model Dirac monopole of charge k. The scattering map R\u22121,1 from t = \u22121 to t = 1 defined for\n(x, y) 6= (0, 0) takes a particularly pleasant form. In the holomorphic trivialisations introduced in Section 2.2 for\nwhich (\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6) = \u2202t , it is simply given by the transition function z k , as shown by Equation (15).\nWe now consider the asymptotics of the scattering map near a singularity for a general U(n) HE-monopole on\nS 1 \u00d7 \u03a3. We do so in a trivialisation that satisfies both\n(\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6)s = 0,\n\n(\u2207x + i\u2207y )s = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nIn particular, it is holomorphic along the surfaces \u03a3t . As before, we call such a trivialisation a holomorphic\ntrivialisation.\nProposition 2.5 In holomorphic trivialisations at t = \u00b11, the scattering map is of the form\nh(z)diag(z k1 , . . . , z kn )g(z),\n\n(21)\n\nwith h and g holomorphic and invertible, and the coordinate z chosen so that the singularity is at z = 0.\nProof: We compare our monopole with a sum of n Dirac monopoles with\nE0 = Lk1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lkn\ni\ndiag(k1 , . . . , kn )\n\u03c60 =\n2R\nThere is then a natural monopole structure on E0\u2217 \u2297 E with connection \u2207 and Higgs fields \u03c6, and with weights\n(ki \u2212 kj ). In the trivialisations used in Definition 2.1, there is a natural identification of E and E0 ; under this\nidentification, we choose the (holomorphic) section S corresponding to the identity map along t = 0 (away from\nz = 0), and extended outwards by integrating (\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6)S = 0.\nAs explained above, solutions to Equation (20) correspond to holomorphic, S 1 -invariant sections upstairs on\n4\nB . Our section S lies in the weight space of weight 0, and so it extends holomorphically and invertibly (since one\ncan do the same for S \u22121 ) to the origin.\nOne has the scattering map diag(z k1 , . . . , z kn ) for E0 ; applying S gives the scattering map S(1, z)diag(z k1 , . . . , z kn )S(\u22121, z)\u22121\nfor E. If one changes the holomorphic trivialisations at t = 1, \u22121, one has the general form given above.\n\u0003\n\n\fSingular HE monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface\n\n3\n\n7\n\nMonopoles and stable pairs\n\n3.1\n\nFrom monopoles to a bundle pair\n\nLet (E, \u2207, \u03c6) be, as above, an HE-monopole. As we have noted, restricting the connection to the surfaces \u03a3t defines\n \u0304\na \u2202-operator\n\u22070,1\n\u03a3 , and so gives Et the structure of a holomorphic bundle, denoted Et ; simultaneously solving\n(\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6)s = 0 and \u22070,1\n\u03a3 s = 0 defines a holomorphic isomorphism Rt,t\u2032 from Et |U to Et\u2032 |U , for U open, as long as\nthe set [t, t\u2032 ] \u00d7 U does not contain any of the singular points pi . The discussions of the previous section can be\nsummarised in:\nProposition 3.1 (Kapustin\u2013Witten [21]) The monopole restricted to the slice \u03a3t defines a holomorphic Gl(n, C)\nbundle Et , away from the pi .\n\u2022 If there are no singular time ti between t and t\u2032 , the scattering map Rt,t\u2032 : Et \u2192 Et\u2032 is an isomorphism.\n\u2022 If only one ti lies between t and t\u2032 , then c1 (Et\u2032 ) \u2212 c1 (Et ) = tr(~ki ), and Rt,t\u2032 : Et \u2192 Et\u2032 is a meromorphic bundle\nmap which is an isomorphism away from zi , and there exist near zi trivialisations of Et , Et\u2032 such that Rt,t\u2032 is\ngiven by diag((z \u2212 zi )ki,1 , . . . , (z \u2212 zi )ki,n ) in these trivialisations. (Here we abuse notation by letting zi denote\nboth a point and its coordinate.)\n\u2022 More generally for all t, t\u2032 , by composition, the scattering maps Rt,t\u2032 : Et \u2192 Et\u2032 are meromorphic bundle maps\nwhich are isomorphisms away from the points z1 , . . . , zN .\nProof: The proof is straightforward and follows from Proposition 2.5.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn particular, integrating around the circle, we have:\nDefinition 3.2 The monodromy \u03c1t of Et is the map Rt,t+T .\nThe monodromy \u03c1t is a meromorphic endomorphism of Et . It has singularities near zi of the form F (z)diag((z \u2212\nzi )ki,1 , . . . , (z \u2212 zi )ki,N )G(z), where F (z), G(z) are holomorphic and invertible.\nDefinition 3.3 A bundle pair (E, \u03c1) is the datum of a holomorphic bundle E on \u03a3 and a meromorphic endomorphism \u03c1 : E \u2192 E such that \u03c1 is an isomorphism outside of a finite set of points.\nThus (Et , \u03c1t ) is a bundle pair. For a bundle pair (E, \u03c1), let us suppose that \u03c1 fails to be regular at p. If the\nrank of E is n, Iwahori's theorem (see [32, Chap. 8] and [18]) tells us that near the singular point p, choosing a\ntrivialisation, and a coordinate z centred at p, one can find invertible holomorphic matrices F (z), G(z) and integers\nsuch that the map \u03c1 in our trivialisation factors as\n\u03c1 = F (z)diag(z l1 , . . . , z ln )G(z),\n\n(22)\n\nwith the set ~l = {l1 , . . . , ln } as invariants.\nIn the case that concerns us here, we adapt the notation given in the introduction and define\n\u0001\nDefinition 3.4 A bundle pair (E, \u03c1) has type K = (~k1 , z1 ), . . . , (~kN , zN ) if its non-regular points are the points\nz1 , . . . , zN , and the map \u03c1 is of the form F (z)diag(z kj1 , . . . , z kjn )G(z), with F and G invertible, near zj , in coordinates z centred at zj .\nWe define the bundle pair associated to a monopole (E, \u2207, \u03c6) as\nH(E, \u2207, \u03c6) := (E0 , \u03c10 ).\nFrom what precedes, we see that for the monopoles we are studying, H(E, \u2207, \u03c6) has type K.\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n3.2\n\n8\n\nConstraints coming from the U(1) case\n\nLet Y = (S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3) \\ {p1 , . . . , pN }. If (E, A, \u03c6) is a U(n) singular monopole on Y with a singularity of weight ~kj at\npj , then (det(E), tr(A), tr(\u03c6)) is a U(1) singular monopole on Y with a singularity of weight tr(~kj ) at pj . We shall\nsee that there are constraints on U(1)-monopoles, in particular on the weights at the singularities and the location\nof the singular points; these restrictions propagate to arbitrary monopoles by taking traces.\nWe consider a U (1) monopole, that is, a triple (E, \u2207, \u03c6), considered modulo gauge transformations:\n1) \u03c6 is a harmonic purely imaginary function (d \u2217 d\u03c6 = 0), of the form ikj /2r + O(1) near the points pj , and\notherwise regular, (r is the geodesic distance to the singularity)\n2) \u2207 = d + A is a U(1)-connection satisfying dA = \u2217d\u03c6.\nNote that once the location of the singular points and the charges kj are fixed, the function \u03c6 is unique up to a\nconstant.\nLet r be small, and let Sj2 (r) denote the sphere of radius r around pj , and let Yr denote the subset of points in\nS\nY that are at least distance r from the singular set.

Since the monodromy \u03c1t is a meromorphic bundle\nmap, its determinant is a meromorphic function, hence its divisor is principal and therefore the locations of the\nsingularities are constrained in the direction along \u03a3. They are, in fact, also constrained in the circle direction.\nProposition 3.5 For a singular U(n)-monopole, we must have\nN\nX\n\ntr(~kj )tj = c1 (E|{0}\u00d7\u03a3 )T.\n\n(24)\n\nj=1\n\nFor a singular U(n) HE-monopole with constant C, we must have\n\u0010\n\u0011\nCn\ntr(~kj )tj = T c1 (E|{0}\u00d7\u03a3 ) +\nVol(\u03a3) .\n2\u03c0\nj=1\n\nN\nX\n\n(25)\n\ni\nProof: Let's start with the U(1) case.

This condition\nimposes constraints on the location of the singular points.\nLet pi = (ti , zi ).

On\nR\nthe other hand, one has 0 = S 1 \u2202t \u03c6 in the circle orthogonal to the surface, away from the singular points. Let\nus suppose that the length of the circle is T , and set tn+1 = T , t0 = 0. Integrating over S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 (removing small\ncylinders around the singular points and taking a limit), we find that\n\n0=\n\ni\u22121\nN\n+1 X\nX\ni=1\n\nj=0\n\nN\nN\nN N\n+1\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u0001\nkj tj .\nkj (T \u2212 tj ) = k0 T \u2212\nkj (ti \u2212 ti\u22121 ) =\nkj (ti \u2212 ti\u22121 ) =\nj=0 i=j+1\n\nj=0\n\nEquation (24) follows easily. The general U (n) case follows by taking traces.\n\nj=1\n\n\u0003\n\n\fSingular HE monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface\n\nAs a corollary of the proposition, the geometric interpretation for the constant C is\nPN\n~\nj=1 tr(kj )tj !\nc\n(E|\n)\n\u2212\n{0}\u00d7\u03a3\n2\u03c0 \u0001 1\nT\n.\nC= \u2212\nVol(\u03a3)\nn\n\n9\n\n(27)\n\nTherefore C is determined by the location of the singularities.\nWe pause for a few remarks that underline the strong parallels that exist between the monopole geometry and\nthe complex geometry in the Abelian case. Let us first see how one can deform from a given solution, fixing the\nlocus of the singularities.\nFor the monopoles, in the U(1) case, once one has \u03c6, one has dA and hence the connection A up to a closed\nimaginary form. The equivalence relation on connections is modification by an imaginary exact form. Thus the\ndeformations of A are parameterised locally by 2g + 1 real parameters, the dimension of H 1 (S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, R). The free\nparameters correspond to the integrals of A around cycles; one can modify A by adding to it lifts of imaginary\nharmonic forms on the Riemann surface, and multiples of the form idt. In addition, one can add an imaginary\nconstant to \u03c6; that is all the freedom one has, since the difference of any two \u03c6 with the same asymptotics is\nbounded, and so a constant, by elliptic regularity and the maximum principle. In short, there is modulo gauge\ntransformations a 2g + 2 real parameter space of pairs (A, \u03c6) once one has fixed the singularities.\nThe monopole yields the complex geometric data of a line bundle on \u03a30 , given by the restriction of the connection\nto \u03a30 , and so an element of the Jacobian; it also gives the monodromy \u03c1, which is independent of the line bundle\nand which once the divisor is fixed is determined up to a non-zero complex constant. In short, one sees that the\nmoduli space of complex data is a C\u2217 -bundle over the Jacobian, and so has the same dimension as our monopole\nmoduli.\nThe constraints on the location of the singularities are similar also: the locations of the poles in the t-direction\nare determined\nin effect by the integral of dt from some base point. In the direction of the Riemann surface \u03a3, the\nP\ndivisor j kj zj must be principal, and Abel's theorem requires that its image under the Abel map lie in the period\nlattice. These constraints on periods can also be seen to intervene in the construction of an Abelian monopole, in\na way similar to the way they intervene in the classical proof of the existence of a holomorphic function in Abel's\ntheorem (see e.g., [12, p.232]). Indeed, in both cases one builds a logarithmic derivative of the Higgs field or of the\nfunction; in both cases one first gets the right singularities, then adjusts so that one has integer periods. A complete\nproof for the Abelian monopoles would lead us into too long a digression, and in any case the general proof valid\nalso in the non-Abelian case is the subject of this paper.\n\n3.3\n\nThe stability conditions\n\nWe now define an appropriate notion of stability for our holomorphic objects. Set\n~t = (t1 , t2 , . . . , tN , T ),\n\n0 < t1 \u2264 t2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 tN \u2264 T.\n\nDefinition 3.6 The ~t-degree \u03b4~t(E, \u03c1) of a bundle pair (E, \u03c1) of singular type K is defined by\nPN\n~\nj=1 tr(kj )tj\n.\n\u03b4~t(E, \u03c1) = c1 (E) \u2212\nT\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nThe ~t-slope of a bundle pair (E, \u03c1) of rank n is the quotient\n\u03bc~t(E, \u03c1) = \u03b4~t(E, \u03c1)/n.\nDefinition 3.7 A bundle pair (E, \u03c1) is ~t-stable (~t-semi-stable) if any proper non-trivial \u03c1-invariant subbundle E \u2032\nsatisfies \u03bc~t(E \u2032 , \u03c1) < (\u2264)\u03bc~t(E, \u03c1). A bundle pair is ~t-polystable if it is the sum of stable bundle pairs of equal ~t-slope.\nRemark\n3.8 The notion of ~t-degree, and hence stability, is invariant under shifting the origin in the circle, as\nP\n~\nj tr(kj ) = 0; it is also invariant as one moves through the singularities, as going through the point pj changes\nc1 (E) by tr(~kj ), but also shifts tj by \u2212T . Indeed, if (E, \u03c1) is obtained from an HE-monopole (E, \u2207, \u03c6), then rewriting\nthe degree as\nN\nX\nX\n\u0001\n(tj+1 \u2212 tj ) c1 (E) +\ntr(~ki )\nj=1\n\ni\u2264j\n\n,\nT\none sees that \u03b4~t(E, \u03c1) is the average degree (average in t) of the restrictions to {t} \u00d7 \u03a3 of the bundle E.\n\u03b4~t(E, \u03c1) =\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n10\n\nIn this paper we show the equivalence between ~t-polystable bundle pairs and HE-monopoles with Dirac singularities. We proceed inductively on the rank. We now prove it in one direction, showing that an HE-monopole\nyields a ~t-polystable pair. Note that stability is automatic in the case of rank one.\nDefinition 3.9 A HE-monopole (E \u2032 , \u2207\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) with constant C \u2032 is a sub-HE-monopole of (E, \u2207, \u03c6) (with constant C)\nif E \u2032 is a subbundle of E preserved by \u2207 and \u03c6 and if \u2207 and \u03c6 restricted to E \u2032 are \u2207\u2032 and \u03c6\u2032\nIn particular, C = C \u2032 .\nProposition 3.10 A bundle pair (E, \u03c1) on \u03a3 corresponding through H to an HE-monopole (E, \u2207, \u03c6) on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3\nwith constant C is ~t-polystable, and ~t-stable if (E, \u2207, \u03c6) is irreducible, that is it admits no sub-HE-monopole.\nProof: Let V be a \u03c1-invariant proper subbundle of E. We can choose this subbundle to be ~t-stable. By Proposition\n4.2, it corresponds to an HE-monopole (V, \u2207, \u03c6) with constant D, and singularities of weight ~lj at the point pj .\nWe do not assume that V is a submonopole of E, although it is clearly a subbundle of E by construction. The\nHE-monopole (V \u2217 \u2297 E, \u2207, \u03c6) has constant C \u2212 D, and has a global \u03c1 invariant section s.\nLet \u2207\u03a3 denote the restriction of the connection to the Riemann surface, and \u2206\u03a3 the associated Laplacian. Using\nthe identities\n0,1\n\u22071,0\n\u03a3 \u2207\u03a3 = (\u2206\u03a3 + iF\u03a3 )\u03c9\n(30)\n(\u2207t + i\u03c6)(\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6) = \u22072t + \u03c62 \u2212 i\u2207t \u03c6,\nwe find that for the section s on \u03a3,\nZ\nhs, i(\u2207t \u03c6 \u2212 F\u03a3 )sid\u03bc\n(C \u2212 D)|s|2L2 =\nS 1 \u00d7\u03a3\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\nhs, \u2212iF\u03a3 si + |\u2207\u03a3 s|2 d\u03bc\nhs, i\u2207t \u03c6si + |\u2207t s|2 + |\u03c6s|2 d\u03bc +\n\u2264\n1\nS 1 \u00d7\u03a3\nZS \u00d7\u03a3\nhs, (i\u2207t \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c62 \u2212 \u22072t )s + (\u2212iF\u03a3 \u2212 \u2206\u03a3 )sid\u03bc\n=\nS 1 \u00d7\u03a3\nZ\n1,0 0,1\nhs, (\u2207t + i\u03c6)(\u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6)s + \u03c9 \u22121 \u2207\u03a3\n\u2207\u03a3 sid\u03bc\n=\u2212\nS 1 \u00d7\u03a3\n\n= 0.\n\nThe third step involves an integration by parts; one checks that this causes no difficulties at the singularities.\nUsing the geometric interpretation of the HE constants given by Equation (27), we obtain \u03bc~t(V, \u03c1) \u2264 \u03bc~t(E, \u03c1) with\nequality only if the section s is covariant constant and intertwines the Higgs fields for E and V , hence if V is a\nsub-HE-monopole. Since the orthogonal complement of V is then also a sub-HE-monopole of constant C, its image\nV in E is also preserved by \u03c1 and we can therefore by induction decompose E in a sum of \u03c1-invariant ~t-stable bundles\nof same slope and (E, \u03c1) is ~t-polystable. The proof is now complete.\n\u0003\nWe note that in other situations of this type of correspondence (see, e.g., Lubke\u2013Teleman [23]), the proof of\nthis direction does not assume the converse for bundles of lower rank, but simply uses an integral of what looks\nlike a second fundamental form. The approach used here allows us to simplify dealing with the asymptotics at the\nsingularity.\n\n4\n\nEquivalence between stable pairs and monopoles\n\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 1.1 given in the Introduction.\nTheorem 4.1 Suppose that the points p1 , . . . , pN \u2208 S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 project to N different points on \u03a3. The map\n1\n~\n~\n~\nH : Mir\nk0 (S \u00d7 \u03a3, p1 , . . . , pN , k1 , . . . , kN ) \u2192 Ms (\u03a3, k0 , K, t)\n\n(E, \u2207, \u03c6) 7\u2192 (E0 , \u03c10 )\n\n(31)\n\nbetween the moduli space of irreducible HE-monopoles and the moduli space of ~t-stable pairs described by Section\n3.1 is a bijection. More generally, the reducible HE-monopoles correspond bijectively to ~t-polystable, but unstable,\npairs.\n\n\fSingular HE monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface\n\n11\n\nThe proof of surjectivity and injectivity are tackled separately by Propositions 4.2 and 4.7 below.\n\u0001\nProposition 4.2 Given a ~t-stable pair (E, \u03c1) on \u03a3 of type K = (~k1 , z1 ), . . . , (~kN , zN ) and the singular time data\n0 < t1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 tN \u2264 T . There is a singular HE-monopole on S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 of with Dirac-type singularities of weight ~kj at\npj = (tj , zj ) for which H(E, \u2207, \u03c6) = (E, \u03c1).\nProof: The steps we follow in showing this proposition are as follows:\n\u2022 We use \u03c1 to extend E to a bundle E on Y = S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 \\ {p1 , . . . , pN }, with the correct degrees on the spheres\naround the points pj , that is holomorphic on all the slices \u03a3t , and lifts to a holomorphic bundle \u0112 on the\ncomplex manifold X = S 1 \u00d7 Y , subset of X\u0304 = S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3, invariant under the action of S 1 on the first factor\nS 1 of X\u0304.\n\u2022 We have on \u0112 a holomorphic structure; thus for any hermitian metric on the bundle, there is a unique unitary\nconnection (the Chern connection) compatible with the holomorphic structure. We choose a hermitian metric\non \u0112 whose Chern connection around the jth singularity is that of the sum of Dirac monopoles of weights ~kj .\n\u2022 This metric serves as an initial metric for the heat flow of Simpson's paper [34]. We take the limit as time\ngoes to infinity to produce a Hermitian\u2013Einstein connection on \u0112, invariant under the action of S 1 on the\nfirst factor of X, and so descending to Y . This process gives us the connection we want on X, and, reducing\nto Y , our HE-monopole.\n\u2022 Simpson's theorem does not immediately give us the regularity we need at the singular points. To see that\nthe singularities are indeed of Dirac type; we finish the proof by lifting locally on three-balls B 3 surrounding\nthe singularities using the Hopf map B 4 \u2192 B 3 .\nThe first step is to extend E to a bundle on Y . We have supposed,\n\u0001 Swithout loss of generality,\n\u0001 that none of the\ntj is zero. Consider the projection map \u03c0 from \u1ef8 = (\u2212T, T ) \u00d7 \u03a3 \\ j (\u2212T, tj \u2212 T ) \u222a (tj , T ) \u00d7 {zj } to \u03a3; take\nthe lift \u03c0 \u2217 E to \u1ef8 . As Y can be obtained from \u1ef8 by an identification (t, z) \u2192 (t + T, z), we define a bundle E on\nY by identifying (t, z, v), t \u2208 (\u2212T, 0), z \u2208 \u03a3, v \u2208 E|z to (t + T, z, \u03c1(z)v). Since the holomorphic map \u03c1 decomposes,\nby hypothesis, into h(z)diagl (z kjl )g(z), in coordinates z centred at the points pj , the bundle one obtains is then\nindeed a sum Lkj1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lkjn in a punctured neighborhood of pj . Lifting to X, as the clutching functions are\nholomorphic, the result is a holomorphic bundle \u0112. Since it is holomorphic, it has a \u2202 operator on it.\nFor the second step, we specify a hermitian metric K on \u0112. This metric specifies the Chern connection: one has\n\u2207 = d + ((\u2202K)K \u22121 )T in a holomorphic trivialisation. We need a metric K whose associated connection is close to\na solution of the Hermitian\u2013Einstein equations, and has the singular behaviour that we want: we therefore choose\nHermitian metrics corresponding to lifts of a sum of Dirac monopoles in a neighbourhood of the singularities. As\nwe also want our metric to be S 1 -invariant on X, we define it on E over Y .\nWe can choose in \u03a3 a small disk D0 , and disks Dj surrounding the zj , such that all these disks are mutually\ndisjoint. We now choose over E = E0 a metric k0 : trivialise E over the complement of D0 , and with respect to this\ntrivialisation, choose the metric k0 = 1 on this complement, then extend to a metric k0 over D0 . The curvature\nF0 of the induced connection is then concentrated on D0 ; its trace represents the first Chern class of E = E0 . Lift\nthe bundle E0 , and the metric k0 , to \u1ef8 . We note that as we vary t, the curvature F0 can no longer represent the\nChern class of Et as t moves through the various singular points, as this Chern class changes. This problem is\nsolved by glueing in Dirac monopoles in balls around the singular points, in such a way that after moving through\nthe singular point pj some curvature is added into the disk Dj .\nMore explicitly, for j = 1, . . . , N let Cj be disks properly included in Dj , and let \u01eb be such that 4\u01eb < min(t1 , t2 \u2212\nt1 , . . . , tN \u2212 tN \u22121 , T \u2212 tN ). We cover Y by open sets\n\u0001\n\u0001\nU0 := (\u22122\u01eb, tN + 2\u01eb) \u00d7 \u03a3 \\ \u222aj (tj \u2212 \u01eb, tN + 2\u01eb) \u00d7 Cj ) ,\nUN +1 := (tN + \u01eb, T \u2212 \u01eb) \u00d7 \u03a3,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nUj\u2212 := (tj \u2212 2\u01eb, tj + 2\u01eb) \u00d7 Dj \\ (tj , tj + 2\u01eb) \u00d7 {zj } , j = 1, . . . , N,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nUj+ := (tj \u2212 2\u01eb, tN + 2\u01eb)) \u00d7 Dj \\ (tj + 2\u01eb, tj ) \u00d7 {zj } , j = 1, . . . , N.\n\nIn the trivialisation given above over the complement of D0 , factor \u03c1 near each point zj as \u03c1 = hj (z)diagl (z kjl )gj (z)\nwith gj , hj invertible, where the coordinate z is centred at zj and is chosen so that the metric osculates at zj the\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n12\n\nEuclidean metric with orthonormal coordinates t, R(z), I(z). An equivalent construction of the bundle E is given\nby specifying the transition functions (f\u03b1,\u03b2 over U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 ):\nf0,j\u2212 = gj , fj\u2212,j+ = diagl (z kjl ), f0,j+ = gj diagl (z kjl ), fj+,N +1 = hj ,\nf0,N +1 = \u03c1 over (tN + \u01eb, tN + 2\u01eb), and f0,N +1 = 1 over (T \u2212 2\u01eb, T \u2212 \u01eb).\nNow note that the bundle and its transition functions are those for sums of Dirac monopoles on Uj\u2212 and Uj+ ; we\nchoose the hermitian metrics diagl ((R \u2212 t)kjl ) on Uj\u2212 , and diagl ((R + t)kjl ) on Uj+ , which are compatible under\nthe change of basis. In parallel, we have the metric lifted from E on U0 , UN +1 . Choosing a partition of unity, we\npatch all these metrics together over Y , taking the non-trivial changes of trivialisations into account.\nThe metric K we have obtained can be lifted to a metric K\u0304 on \u0112.\nLemma 4.3 The pair (\u0112, K\u0304) constructed above has the following properties\n\u2022 \u0112 is invariant under the action of S 1 on X; this action complexifies to an action of C\u2217 over S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 (\u03a3 \\\n{z1 , . . . , zN }), with the action of the real element T \u2208 R \u2282 C\u2217 corresponding to \u03c1\n\u2022 K\u0304 is invariant under the action of S 1 on \u0112,\n\u2022 in the neighborhood of the inverse image of the singular point pj , the pair (\u0112, K\u0304) corresponds to a sum of\nEuclidean Dirac monopole of weight ~kj ,\n\u2022 (\u0112, K\u0304) satisfies a bound |\u039bFK\u0304 | \u2264 c < \u221e.\n\u22a5\nThe first three properties follow by construction. For the fourth, we note that \u039bFK\u0304\nwould be 0 in a neighbourhood of the singular circles if the metric on X in this neighbourhood were Euclidean. Since we took coordinates\nosculating the Euclidean metric to second order, we still have the bound. We note that we could have glued in the\n\u22a5\nDirac monopoles in the S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 metric produced in Section 2.3 instead of the Euclidean ones, in which case \u039bFK\u0304\nwould indeed be zero in a neighbourhood of the singularities; we have used the Euclidean ones for explicitness.\n1\nWe note that the curvature of the Chern connection is concentrated on (S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 D0 ) \u222a (\u222aN\nj=1 (S \u00d7 (tj \u2212 2\u01eb, T ) \u00d7\nDj )).\nWe take K as the starting point for Simpson's heat flow\n\nH \u22121\n\ndH\n\u22a5\n= \u2212i\u039bFH\n,\ndu\nH0 = K.\n\n(32)\n\nThe asymptotic behaviour of this heat flow is governed by the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4 (Simpson [34, Thm 1, p. 878, case \u03b8 = 0]) Let (X, \u03c9) satisfy certain conditions given below in\nLemma 4.6, and suppose E is an S 1 -invariant bundle on X with S 1 -invariant metric K satisfying the assumption\nthat sup |\u039bFK | < c. Suppose E is stable, in the sense that it arises from a stable pair on \u03a3. Then there is a S 1  \u0304 \u22121 H) \u2208 L2 , and such that \u039bF \u22a5 = 0.\ninvariant metric H with det(H) = det(K), H and K mutually bounded, \u2202(K\nH\n\u22121\nIn addition, if R is the distance to one of the singularities, R * d(K H) is bounded by a constant.\n(The last sentence does not appear as part of Simpson's statement of the theorem, but is given in a remark after\nhis Lemma 6.4)\n\u22a5\nSince H\u221e is S 1 -invariant, we can quotient out and consider it on E (over Y ). The equation \u039bFH\n= 0 then\n\u221e\nbecomes the HE-Bogomolny equation (5). The metric H\u221e is of course obtained as the limit limu\u2192\u221e Hu of the heat\nflow.\nSimpson uses a notion of stability slightly different from ours. His degree is\nZ\ntr(\u039bFK ).\ndeg(E, K) = i\nX\n\nLemma 4.5 The two notions of degree coincide: deg(E, K) = T \u03b4~t(E, \u03c1).

Indeed, for \u00ca, the quantity tr(\u039bFK ) is equal to the lift of tr(F\u03a3 \u2212 \u2207t \u03c6). Integrating tr(F\u03a3 )\nPN\ngives, as above, T c1 (E0 ) \u2212 j=1 tr(~kj )tj ; integrating \u2207t \u03c6, starting with the t-direction, gives 0.\nWe note that from the definition of \u00ca, \u03c1-invariant subbundles V of E naturally give S 1 -invariant subbundles V\u0302\nof \u00ca; on the other hand, if a subbundle V\u0302 of \u00ca is S 1 -invariant, it is also C\u2217 -invariant, and one can define a pair\n(V, \u03c1) by setting V = V\u0302 |{(0,0)}\u00d7\u03a3 and using the time T action of C\u2217 to define \u03c1. The proof of the equivalence of\ndegrees for V and V\u0302 goes through as for the bundle as a whole.\n\u0003\n(Lemma 4.5)\n\u0001\nLemma 4.6 The manifold X = S 1 \u00d7 (S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3) \\ {p1 , . . . , pN } satisfy the three conditions necessary to Simpson's\nTheorem 4.4:\n1. X is a K\u00e4hler manifold of finite volume;\n2. there is on X a non-negative exhaustion function whose Laplacian is bounded;\n3. there is an increasing function a : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) with a(0) = 0 and a(x) = x when x > 1, such that if f is a\nbounded positive function on X with \u2206(f ) \u2264 B then\nZ\n\u0001\nsup |f | \u2264 C(B)a\n|f | ,\nX\n\nX\n\nand furthermore, if \u2206(f ) \u2264 0 then \u2206(f ) = 0.\n\nProof of Lemma 4.6. The first condition is obviously satisfied by the construction of X.\nTo construct the non-negative exhaustion function on X subject of the second condition, we first build a function\nf on Y whose Laplacian is bounded. The wanted exhaustion function is the pull back of f to X via the projection\non Y . If the Laplacian of f on Y is bounded, then the Laplacian of the corresponding pull-backed f on X is also\nbounded.\nLet Rj be the geodesic distance in S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 to the singularity pj . In the Euclidean case, there is an obvious\ncandidate for f : let f be 1/Rj close to pj and extend it smoothly to the rest of Y . Since 1/R is harmonic in\nR3 , the Laplacian of f on Y is obviously bounded. For other Riemann surfaces, \u2206(1/R) has a term behaving like\n1/R so we have to be careful and find a bounded function whose Laplacian kills that extra 1/R factor. In [29,\nProp 3.2.2], Pauly proves that there is a harmonic function fj on a neighborhood of the singularity pj such that\nfj = 1/Rj + O(1). This function is exactly what we are looking for, and extending all the fj to Y we find a function\nf whose Laplacian is bounded. The obtained function f is exactly the type of exhaustion function we are looking\nfor.\nproves in [34, Prop 2.2] that the third condition is fulfilled for the smaller space X o = (T 2 \u00d7 \u03a3) \\\nS Simpson\n2\no\n\u0003\nj T \u00d7 {zj }.

We need to understand why the corresponding HE-monopole\nhas the desired Dirac monopole behavior at the poles. For this, as above, we can use the local construction exploited\nboth by Kronheimer [22] and Pauly [30] and explained on page 5: one considers the quadratic map \u03c0 : B 4 \u2192 B 3\ngiven by\n\u03c0(w1 , w2 ) = (t = |w1 |2 \u2212 |w2 |2 , z = x + iy = 2w1 w2 , )\n(33)\n\nThis defines a lift of forms \u03c0 \u2217 ; as noted above in Section 2.3, if we add an extra variable s to B 3 , expanding to\n \u0303 = \u2207 + \u03c6ds (recall that our\nS 1 \u00d7 B 3 , we can write the HE\u2013Bogomolny equations for \u2207, \u03c6 as the HE equations for \u2207\ncomplex coordinates are t \u2212 is, z); if we make the formal definition \u03c0 \u2217 ds = \u03be, where \u03be as above is the S 1 invariant\nform\n1\n\u03be = (w1 dw 1 \u2212 w1 dw1 \u2212 w2 dw2 + w 2 dw2 )\ni\nthen the process used by Kronheimer and Pauly to smooth out the Dirac singularities associates to (\u2207 = d + A, \u03c6)\nb = \u03c0\u2217 \u2207\n \u0303 = \u03c0 \u2217 \u2207 + \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c6\u03be; the curvatures are related by\nthe \"lift\" on B 4 : \u2207\n\u2217\n\u2217\nF\u2207\nb = \u03c0 F\u2207\ne + \u03c0 \u03c6d\u03be.\n\nNow we have for an HE-monopole on B 3 an equation given by asking that, after lifting to S 1 \u00d7 B 3 , the projection\nof the curvature onto the space of self-dual two-forms, with kernel the space of anti-self-dual two-forms, take on a\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n14\n\nspecified value.

Thus\n\u0125 = h, telling us that the global h given by Simpson's result has the required smoothness at the singular points (as\n\u0125 does) to ensure that the Higgs field and its covariant derivative have the correct Dirac type singularities.\n\u0003\nWe now have a HE-monopole corresponding to our initial data; we now must check that it is unique.\nProposition 4.7 Given two monopoles (E, \u2207, \u03c6) and (E \u2032 , \u2207\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) yielding isomorphic holomorphic data.

By exhibiting\nparametrices, Pauly shows that despite the presence of singularities, the complex is Fredholm. This result relies on\nthe fact that near the singularities, the asymptotic behaviour guarantees that a local lift from the three-ball to the\nfour-ball using the Hopf fibration is non-singular. The index can then be obtained by an excision argument from\nthe case with no singularities. In that (compact) case, since the dimension is odd, Atiyah\u2013Singer's index theorem\ntells us the index is 0. The contribution to the index given by the singularities translates the problem into one over\nthe three-sphere, and Pauly then uses the lift to the four-sphere to transform the calculation into that of an S 1\nequivariant index.\nWe note also that, in the case of the three-torus, when there are no singularities (K = 0), we are in essence\nreduced to the flat (Abelian) case: the index is zero, and both kernel and cokernel are of constant real rank 4n.\nThis result is confirmed by a parameter count: 3n parameters for a flat connection, which is a representation of\nZ3 = \u03c01 (T 3 ) into (the maximal torus of) U (n), and n parameters for a constant Higgs field.\n\n5.3\n\nHigher genus\n\nReturning to our complex descriptions of the moduli, many of the techniques used for studying the moduli space\nin [15] also apply to the case of HE-monopoles over S 1 \u00d7 \u03a3 with \u03a3 of higher genus, apart from the derivation of the\nPoisson structure and the existence of an integrable system.\nWe first note that our moduli space of stable pairs\nP can be examined as a subspace of a space that has already\nbeen constructed. Consider the divisor Dmax = \u2212 j minl (kjl )zj . Then \u03c1 is a section of End(E)(Dmax ), and one\ncan realise the space of our (E, \u03c1) (for t = (ti ) small) as a subvariety of the space of stable pairs consisting of a\nbundle and an endomorphism with poles at Dmax . This moduli space N (k0 , Dmax ) has been constructed in [27; 33].\nWe can thus study M(\u03a3, k0 , K, ~t) as a subvariety of N (k0 , Dmax ).\nA first step, however, is to check that at least some of our spaces M(\u03a3, k0 , K, ~t) are non-empty, provided again\nthat the divisor D is principal, which it must be as it represents\ndet(\u03c1). Suppose that D is non-zero. For each point\nP\nzi , choose a permutation \u03c3i of {1, . . . , n} and set Dj = i ki,\u03c3i (j) zi . Let L be a line bundle on the curve, and set\nLj = L(D1 + * * * + Dj ), j = 1, . . . , n. There is a natural meromorphic map \u03c1j+1 : Lj \u2192 Lj+1 with divisor Dj+1 . In\nthe same vein, the natural map L \u2192 L1 yields a map \u03c11 : Ln \u2192P\nL1 when premultiplied by det(\u03c1)\u22121 . This map has\ndivisor D1 . Let E be the bundle \u2295j Lj ; it has degree n deg(L) + i (n \u2212 i + 1) deg(Di ). Let s be the residue modulo\nn of this degree; as usual, it is just the value modulo n that is of any importance.\nProposition 5.5 Suppose that the divisor D is principal and that the permutations are such that not all the degrees\nof Lj are the same. The moduli space M(\u03a3, mn + s, K, ~t) is non-empty. Suppose in addition that one of the Lj has\ndegree n greater than any of the others. Then one can also produce an element of M(\u03a3, mn + r, K, ~t) for any r.\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\nProof: Consider the bundle E constructed above of degree mn + s.\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n0 ***\n0\n\uf8ec \u03c12 0\n0\n*\n*\n*\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u03c13 0 * * *\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n.\n..\n\u03c1=\uf8ec0\n0\n0 \u03c14\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec. . . . . .\n.\n.\n..\n..\n\uf8ec .\n.\n.\n\uf8ed\n..\n. 0\n0 \u03c1n\u22121\n0\n\n18\n\nDefine the map \u03c1 by\n\uf8f6\n\u03c11\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(40)\n\n0\n\nIt has the right polar structure. We can ask when the pair (E, \u03c1) is stable. The determinant of \u03c1 has divisor D;\naway from the singular set of \u03c1, the eigenvalues of \u03c1, which are the n-th roots of det(\u03c1), are distinct. Now consider\na subbundle V of rank k that is \u03c1-invariant; locally, it is a sum of eigenbundles. The projection of V onto any\nsum Li1 \u2295 Li2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lik has generically non-zero determinant since it is a Vandermonde-type determinant of the\neigenvalues involved. Globally, V is then a subsheaf of Li1 \u2295 Li2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Lik ; this inclusion bounds the degree of V .\nIf we have chosen the Lij of smallest degree, V cannot destabilise.\nTo consider the case of general degree, one can take Hecke transforms E \u2032 of E along the eigenspaces of \u03c1, obtaining\nsubsheaves of E and reducing the degree by 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1 in turn. The result is still stable, as any \u03c1-invariant\nsubbundle V \u2032 of E \u2032 , thought of as a subsheaf of E, then satisfies deg(V \u2032 )/rank(V \u2032 ) < (\u2212n+deg(E))/n \u2264 deg(E \u2032 )/n.\n\u0003\nOne would like to get an idea of the Zariski tangent space of M(\u03a3, j, K, ~t), at the points of the moduli space\nwe have just constructed. As in [15, Sec. 4], let us consider the subbundle\n\u2206\u03c1 := {(a, b) | a + Ad\u03c1 (b) = 0}\n\n(41)\n\nof End(E) \u2295 End(E). Denote the quotient by\nad(E, \u03c1) := [End(E) \u2295 End(E)]/\u2206\u03c1 .\n\n(42)\n\nWe get the short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 \u2206\u03c1 \u2192 [End(E) \u2295 End(E)] \u2192 ad(E, \u03c1) \u2192 0.\n(43)\nPN ~\nThe degree of ad(E, \u03c1) is computed by [15, Lemma 4.9] to be i=1 [ki ]. As in [15, Cor. 4.3], we have the following\nproposition; see also [3; 4; 24].\n\nProposition 5.6 The infinitesimal deformations of the pair (E, \u03c1) in M(\u03a3, j, K, ~t) are naturally identified by the\nfirst hyper-cohomology of the complex (in degrees 0 and 1)\nad\u03c1\n\nEnd(E) \u2212\u2192 ad(E, \u03c1).\n\n(44)\n\nRoughly, the first hypercohomology combines both H 1 (\u03a3, End(E)), the deformations of the bundle, and H 0 (\u03a3, ad(E, \u03c1)),\nthe deformations of \u03c1.\nThe dimension H1 of the first hypercohomology is given by\nH1 = H0 + H2 \u2212 \u03c7(End(E)) + \u03c7(ad(E, \u03c1)) = H0 + H2 +\n0\n\nN\nX\n\n[~ki ]\n\ni=1\n\nIf (E, \u03c1) is simple, the dimension H is 1, as in [15, Sec. 4]. The dual space to the second cohomology is given,\nagain as in [15, Sec. 4], by the kernel of ad\u03c1 : \u2206\u03c1 \u2297 K \u2192 End(E) \u2297 K, that is the sections of End(E) \u2297 K that\ncommute with \u03c1. If \u03c1 is generically regular, this kernel is generated away from the poles\nby the powers 1, \u03c1, . . . , \u03c1n\u22121\nPn\u22121\nof \u03c1, tensored with K. Globally, the sections of the kernel are given as expressions i=0 ai \u03c1i , where ai is a form\nsuch that the product ai \u03c1i is holomorphic. In our case, the coefficient ai must have divisor greater or equal to\nmax(\u2212D1 \u2212 D2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Di , \u2212D2 \u2212 D3 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Di+1 , . . . , \u2212Dn \u2212 D1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Di\u22121 ). For fairly general choices of divisors,\nif one has more than g points, this condition forces ai = 0 for i > 0 and a0 to be a holomorphic one-form; one then\nhas dim(H2 ) = g. This computation yields\ndim(H1 ) = (g + 1) +\n\nN\nX\n\n[~ki ].\n\ni=1\n\nWhen the elements of H2 live in the trace component a0 , as it is the case here under our genericity assumptions\non the divisors, it is shown in [15, Thm 4.13] that the deformations are unobstructed and the space is smooth.\n\n\fSingular HE monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface\n\n19\n\nRemark 5.7 If E has trivial determinant and det(\u03c1) = 1, one can consider the space of deformations that preserve\nthis property; this situation corresponds to SU(n) monopoles. (We note that this constrains the location of the\nsingularities in the circle direction.) As the elements of H0 , H2 lie in the trace component, the deformations keeping\nPN\none in Sl(n) lie in a i=1 [~ki ]-dimensional space; the extra g + 1 parameters for Gl(n) correspond to rescaling \u03c1\n(one parameter) and tensoring E by a line bundle (g parameters).\n\n5.4\n\nHigher genus: SU(2), U(2)\n\nThe preceding results are only rather partial: as one can see, the combinatorics of the degrees is fairly complicated.\nWe now consider the case of Sl(2)-bundles, with endomorphisms of determinant one; these correspond to SU(2)monopoles. P\nLet us suppose given a pair (E, \u03c1), with singularites of type (ki , \u2212ki ), ki > 0 at points zi . Let D+ be\nthe divisor i ki zi . By what is now a fairly standard construction, one has a spectral curve {(z, \u03bb) \u2208 \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 |\ndet(\u03c1(z) \u2212 \u03bbI) = 0} in \u03a3 \u00d7 P1 , giving a two sheeted cover of \u03a3. In addition, one can define what is generically a\nline bundle L over the spectral curve; away from the poles of \u03c1, it is the quotient sheaf, defined over the total space\nof the bundle O(D+ ) over \u03a3 as\n\u03c1\u2212\u03bbI\n\n0 \u2192 E \u2192 E \u2192 L.\nWe note that as the spectrum is invariant under \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bb\u22121 , the spectral curve is the pullback of the graph of the\nfunction tr(\u03c1) under the map f = \u03bb + \u03bb\u22121 . One sees that the singular points of the endomorphism \u03c1 are located at\nthe poles of f , and that the branch locus B for projection of the spectral curve to \u03a3 is given by the inverse image\nof {\u22122, 2}. The curve is smooth if all the points of B occur with multiplicity one. The curve has an involution i,\nand the determinant form on the bundle E identifies L\u2217 with i\u2217 (L)(\u2212B) (as in [14]), so that L lies in a suitable\nPrym variety.\nConversely, given the spectral curve S and the line bundle L lying in the Prym variety, one can reconstruct E as\na push-down \u03c0\u2217 (L), and \u03c1 as the endomorphism on E induced by multiplication by \u03bb on L. If S is smooth, stability\nis automatic: any invariant subbundle corresponds to a subset of the eigenvalues away from the branch points, and\ngoing around these branch points permutes them, so that an invariant subbundle is necessarily the whole bundle.\nThus\nProposition 5.8 An SU(2)-monopole on S 1 \u00d7\u03a3, with singularities K, yields a pair (f, L) where f is a meromorphic\nfunction with polar divisor D+ , and L is a sheaf over the double cover S of \u03a3 branched over B, the locus defined by\nf \u22121 ({2, \u22122}). If all the points in the support of B occur with multiplicity one in B, the spectral curve S is smooth,\nand L is a line bundle on S belonging to the Prym variety of sheaves on S satisfying L\u2217 \u2243 i\u2217 (L)(\u2212B), where i is\nthe natural involution.\nConversely, given (f, L), where f has polar divisor D, if all the points in the support of B occur with multiplicity\none in B, then the double cover S is smooth. If L belongs to the Prym variety, then the pair (f, L) corresponds to\na singular SU(2)-monopole.\n\nOne can then count parameters. For d+ > 2g \u2212 2, the space of functions f with divisor exactly D+ has\ndimension d+ + 1 \u2212 g, for d+ = deg(D+ ) . If the locus f \u22121 ({2, \u22122}) consists of distinct points, the genus of S, from\nthe Riemann\u2013Hurwitz formula, is then 2g \u2212 1 + d+ , and so the Prym variety has dimension g \u2212 1 + d+ ; the SU(2)\nmoduli space thus has dimension 2d+ in all.\n\u0001\nWe now can consider the more general case of a Gl(2, C) bundle, and a map \u03c1 with singularities K = (k1,+ , k1,\u2212 ), zi , . . . , (kN\nwith ki,+ \u2265 ki,\u2212 ; this pair P\ncorrespond to a U(2) (HE)-monopole. There is again the constraint imposes by the requirement that the divisor i (ki,+ +ki,\u2212 )zi be principal, as it must be the divisor of det(\u03c1). The same constructions\ngive one a double cover S of \u03a3, defined by the equation\n\u03bb2 \u2212 tr(\u03c1)\u03bb + det(\u03c1) = 0.\nAs above, one has a sheaf L over S, which is a line bundle if S is smooth. L no longer necessarily satisfies the Prym\ncondition.\nP\nAgain,\nP count parameters. The function tr(\u03c1) must have a divisor which is greater than i ki,\u2212 zi ; if\nP one can\nd = \u2212 i ki,\u2212 = i ki,+ , then for d > 2g \u2212 2 this gives d + 1 \u2212 g parameters. The determinant is fixed, up to scale;\nthis gives one extra parameter. On the line bundles, one has 2g \u2212 1 + d parameters, giving 2d + g + 1 parameters\nin all: roughly, the parameters for the Sl(2, C) case, plus a line bundle on \u03a3, plus a scale parameter for \u03c1.\n\n\fBenoit Charbonneau and Jacques Hurtubise\n\n6\n\n20\n\nMonopoles on the product of a Riemann surface and an interval\n\nOne can use the result to consider the case of a monopole on the product I \u00d7 \u03a3 of a Riemann surface and an interval\nI = [0, c]. In this case, the relevant holomorphic data is a pair of holomorphic bundles E = E(0), E \u2032 = E(c) and a\nmeromorphic automorphism \u03c1 : E \u2192 E \u2032 . If zi , i = 1, . . . , N are the singularities of \u03c1, choose ti so that pi = (ti , zi )\nare the locations of our eventual monopole's singularities.\nProposition 6.1 Given \u03c1 : E \u2192 E \u2032 , one can find a complementary \u03c3 : E \u2032 \u2192 E with singularities at zN +1 , . . . , zN +M\nsuch that \u03c1, \u03c3 have disjoint singularities, and tN +1 , . . . , tN +M such that (E, \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1) is a ~t-stable pair. One can also\narrange for the HE-constant C to be zero.\nThe proof is fairly simple. If one allows sufficiently many poles, one can find a large number of \u03c3; the trick is\nto ensure that the result is ~t-stable. The simplest way to ensure stability is to arrange for there to be no \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1invariant subbundles at all, a more restrictive condition. As pointed out above, invariant subbundles are sums of\ngeneralised eigenspaces; if the spectral curve has a branch point that permutes all of these eigenspaces with no\ninvariant subset, then we are done. Now, one can prescribe the behaviour of \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1 on any formal neighbourhood\nof a given point, providing one allows sufficiently many poles elsewhere; one then asks that this point be a branch\npoint that permutes all the eigenspaces, which is ensured by prescribing the behaviour on a formal neighbourhood\nof sufficiently high order by letting \u03c3 be the composition of a well chosen Jordan form by \u03c1\u22121 .\nCorollary 6.2 There is a monopole with singularities at pi , i = 1, . . . , N corresponding to the holomorphic data\nE = E(0), E \u2032 = E(c), \u03c1 : E \u2192 E \u2032 .\nOne simply embeds the interval I in a circle C, and places the extra poles (those of \u03c3) in the complement of I.\nOne then applies the theorem for the circle, obtains a monopole on C \u00d7 \u03a3, and restricts to I \u00d7 \u03a3.\nThe monopoles associated to a given set of holomorphic data are not unique. Indeed, one can complete by\ndifferent maps \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 , and there is no reason why the monopoles one obtains by restricting to I \u00d7 \u03a3 should be the\nsame.\n\n7\n\nHE-Monopoles on a flat circle bundle\n\nIf one has a flat principal circle bundle Y over a Riemann surface \u03a3, then any metric on \u03a3 and any choice of length\nT of the circle yield a canonical metric on the circle bundle: at a point p on the circle bundle, one takes a local\nflat lift of \u03a3 given by the connection, and the tangent space of the circle bundle decomposes into a sum (that we\nstipulate to be orthogonal) of the orbit direction and the tangent to the section. On the first one has a natural\nmetric inherited from the invariant metric we have chosen on the circle, and on the latter the lift of the metric on\n\u03a3; the two combine to give a metric on Y .\ne \u2192 \u03a3, and lift our circle bundle Y with flat connection to Ye \u2192 \u03a3.\ne One can\nNow pass to the universal covering \u03a3\nchoose a global flat section S on this universal cover, avoiding the lifts of the singularities. This section trivialises\nthe circle bundle; let S correspond to t = 0. Let D be the group of deck transformation of this covering. For\neach D \u2208 D , one has an element x(D) of the circle such that the original flat circle bundle over \u03a3 is obtained by\nidentifying (z, t) and (D(z), x(D) * t).\ne This bundle\nThe restriction of the lift of an HE-monopole to S yields a holomorphic vector bundle Ee over \u03a3.\ndescends to \u03a3; one uses \u2207t \u2212 i\u03c6 to define a parallel transport T (x(D)) from the fiber at (D(z), x(D) * t) to (D(z), t).\nThe holomorphic bundle E on \u03a3 is obtained by composing the natural identification of Ee(z,t) and Ee(D(z),x(D)*t) with\nthe transport from Ee(D(z),x(D)*t) to Ee(D(z),t) . These identifications intertwine the parallel transport \u03c1e mapping Ee to\nitself, and so \u03c1e descends to \u03c1 : E \u2192 E.\nLet z\u0303i be a lift of the point zi to S and let t(z\u0303i ) denote the time one must flow from the section S to the lift of\nthe point pi .
