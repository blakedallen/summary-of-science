As it has been pointed out in papers by Kikkawa\nand Yamasaki [1] and Sakai and Senda [2] it arises the formal symmetry of quantum effective\npotential of free toroidally compactified string theory under interchange of a torus radii with\ntheir inverse. In its turn this phenomenon occurs in the firstly quantized string theory by virtue\nof symmetry of the mass2 operator under R \u2194 1/R interchange supplemented by interchange\nof Kaluza-Klein and winding modes arising under compactification. The next important step\nwas made in paper by Nair, Shapere, Strominger and Wilczek [3] where this symmetry was\njustified in the interacting case as well, and therefore received the status of exact symmetry of\nfirstly quantized string theory. However only after the seminal papers by Buscher [4] it became\nclear that at the level of classical string dynamics this symmetry is realized as impossibility\nto differentiate (special kind of or so-called dual) backgrounds with (one or many) isometry\ndirections in which string propagates. Connection between such kind of backgrounds coming\nfrom the target-space metric, the 2-form antisymmetric tensor field and the dilaton is given by\nthe set of Buscher's formulae 4 [4].\nConsideration of the long-wave limit of superstring theory corresponding to supergravity\naction also leads to the establishing the symmetry between dimensionally reduced dual theories\n[6]\u2013[9] and allows to exhibit more clearly the space-time interpretation of the duality transformations as ones acting only on the matter fields and leaving the gravitational sector unchanged.\nAlso, the target-space geometry adapted to the T-duality transformations was constructed in\n[10].\nWhat concerns supersymmetric string theory, the T-duality transformations were intensively\ninvestigated in the NSR (worldsheet SUSY) formulation (see, for instance [11]\u2013[14] and Refs.\ntherein), although the absence of direct connection between worldsheet and target-space supersymmetries, which can be established with application of the CFT technique [15], hampered the\nproblem of getting the T-duality rules for the space-time fermions (see, however, [16]). This\ndrawback naturally overcomes in the manifestly target-space supersymmetric formulation of the\nGS superstring, however the progress in the construction of T-duality rules in the GS formulation\n[17]\u2013[19] was achieved only recently.\nTherefore, superstring and supergravity encourage the exact symmetry under the T-duality\ntransformations. Moreover, as it has been pointed out in literature (see e.g. [20]) the sum of\nsupergravity action and fundamental superstring source action should be T-duality covariant.\nThe goal of this communication is to push forward this observation and to establish the invariance\nof dual theories under the T-duality transformations for the toy model of closed bosonic string\nbeing the source for gravity and 2-form antisymmetric tensor field. Because our consideration is\npure bosonic we will to refer in what follows this bulk configuration as low energy quantum string\ntheory effective action [21] or effective action for shortness. It is clear that such a configuration\nis the part of the bosonic sector of supergravity being the superstring theory effective action.\nAnother point of our consideration consists in the restriction of our analysis to the pure classical\nframes. It means that we shall not consider the dilaton appearance in the string action and,\nconsequently, in the set of the T-duality rules, because it is well-known that the dilaton shift\n4\n\nThe analog of these formulas for the target-space metric was derived independently by Hitchin, Karlhede,\n\nLindstr\u00f6m and Ro\u010dek in [5] addressed to investigation of d-dimensional non-linear sigma-model.\n\n2\n\n\fappearing in the Buscher's formulae can be described correctly only in the frame of quantum\napproach [22], [23] (and Refs. therein). However, since supergravity contains the information\nabout quantum corrections of the worldsheet, we have to take into account the dilaton shift as\nfar as the effective action will be considered.\nTo reach the goal we analyse two different approaches which lead to the result. The first\napproach is the standard one and it demonstrates the role of worldvolume duality in establishing\nthe T-duality invariance in the bulk. The second approach we propose is based on the gauging\nof the translational invariance along isometry direction simultaneously in the bulk and in the\nsource parts of the effective action with source. This forces us, in particular, to introduce new\nadditional target-space field instead of worldvolume one as it is made in the first case.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a brief review of derivation of the\nBuscher's formulae in the standard sigma-model-like [4] and gauged sigma-model-like [24]\u2013[29]\napproaches. Section 3 devoted to the recalling the T-duality rules in Kaluza-Klein picture [7, 8],\nwhich simplify calculations (see, for instance, [30] for non-Abelian case, and Ref. [10], where\nsuch kind of transformations arise in the geometry of a target-space adapted to the presence of\nisometries) and in Section 4 we outline the application of these rules to the gauged-sigma-model.\nAfter these preliminaries in Section 5 we demonstrate the invariance between dual effective\ntheories in presence of the fundamental string source. Discussion of the obtained results and\nconcluding remarks are collected in the last section.\n\n2\n\nT-duality in bosonic string theory\n\nConsider Polyakov's action for bosonic (closed) string [31]\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be \u2212\u03b3\u03b3 ij \u2202i X m \u2202j X n gmn (X).\n\n(1)\n\nTo reach T-dual action, let's suppose that we have an isometry direction, say X 0 5 , and evidently\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be \u2212\u03b3\u03b3 ij (\u2202i X 0 \u2202j X 0 g00 + \u2202i X 0 \u2202j X m\u0303 g0m\u0303 + \u2202i X m\u0303 \u2202j X 0 gm\u03030 + \u2202i X m\u0303 \u2202j X \u00f1 gm\u0303\u00f1 ).\n\n(2)\n\nAfter that one can write down (2) in the first order form [5], [32] as\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be[ \u2212\u03b3\u03b3 ij (Ci Cj g00 + Ci \u2202j X m\u0303 g0m\u0303 + \u2202i X m\u0303 Cj gm\u03030 + \u2202i X m\u0303 \u2202j X \u00f1 gm\u0303\u00f1 )\n\u2212 2\u01ebij Ci \u2202j X\u0302 0 ].\n\n(3)\n\nEq. of motion for X\u0302 0 field enforces the curl free condition for worldvolume variables Ci , and,\ntherefore, locally\nCi = \u2202i X\u0303 (0) .\n(4)\nStrictly speaking X\u0303 (0) is different from X 0 . However, we can always sew their by virtue of the\ninvariance of (2) under X 0 \u2192 X 0 + const, so it can be supposed that Ci = \u2202i X 0 and the action\n(2) is recovered.\n5\n\nThis notation rises to the notations of Ref. [4] and we would like to keep it suggesting that there will not be\n\na confusion between isometry and time-like coordinates.\n\n3\n\n\fAnother story begins if one integrates out the new variables Ci . To see it, it is convenient\nto record the action (2) in the form of\nZ\n\nS=\n\nM2\n\ndX m \u2227 \u2217dX n gmn\n\n(5)\n\nand to make the same procedure as in (3). Therefore\nS=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\nC \u2227 \u2217Cg00 + C \u2227 \u2217dX \u00f1 g0\u00f1 + dX m\u0303 \u2227 \u2217Cgm\u03030 + dX m\u0303 \u2227 \u2217dX \u00f1 gm\u0303\u00f1 \u2212 2C \u2227 dX\u0302 0 .\n\n(6)\n\nIntegrating out the C field we derive\n\u2190\n\u2212\n\u03b4L\n= \u2217Cg00 + \u2217dX \u00f1 g0\u00f1 \u2212 dX\u0302 0 = 0,\n\u03b4C\nC =\u2212\nand\nS=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\n1\n(i0 g \u2212 \u2217dX\u0302 0 ),\ng00\n\ndX m\u0303 \u2227 \u2217dX \u00f1 gm\u0303\u00f1 \u2212\n\n\u2217C = \u2212\n\n1\n(\u2217i0 g \u2212 dX\u0302 0 )\ng00\n\n1\n1\n2\ni0 g \u2227 \u2217i0 g +\ndX\u0302 0 \u2227 \u2217dX\u0302 0 +\ni0 g \u2227 dX\u0302 0 .\ng00\ng00\ng00\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nImportant point is that the action (8) written in the dual with respect to the C field variables\ndX\u0302 0 still allows for eq. (4), however it becomes \"Bianchi identity\" for the solution to the\nequation of motion for C following from the original action [5] (see also Refs. [33] and [34]).\nIt is easy to see that this action is equivalent to the string action propagating in dual\nbackground, which is parameterized by the coordinates X\u0303 m = (X m\u0303 , X\u0302 0 ), with the NS 2-form\npotential B\u0303 (2) , i.e.\nZ\nS=\n\nwhere [4]\n\nM2\n\ndX\u0303 m \u2227 \u2217dX\u0303 n g\u0303mn + 2B\u0303 (2) ,\n\n1\ng0m\u0303 g0\u00f1 ,\ng00\ng0m\u0303\n(2)\n= \u2212B\u0303m0 =\n,\ng00\n\ng\u0303m\u0303\u00f1 = gm\u0303\u00f1 \u2212\n(2)\n\nB\u03030m\n\ng\u030300 =\n\n(9)\n\n1\n,\ng00\n\n(2)\n\nB\u0303m\u0303\u00f1 = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, target-space duality switches the pure gravitational background to the dual background with gravity and the NS 2-form gauge field.

Let us now to require the\ninvariance of the action under the local shift with some arbitrary function f (X m\u0303 ). In this case\nthe invariance is spoiled by the terms constructed out the differentials of new function f (X m\u0303 ).\nTo compensate this contribution it is necessary to extend usual derivative with vector field as\nDX m = dX m + Ckm ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere km is the Killing vector in the isometry direction. Then, in the so-called adapted frame\nm\nwhere km = \u03b40 the covariant derivative DX 0 is inert under \u03b4X 0 = f supported by \u03b4C = \u2212d\u01eb\nwith local parameter \u01eb(X m\u0303 ). Therefore, in this picture the action (6) becomes\nS=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\nDX m \u2227 \u2217DX n gmn \u2212 2C \u2227 dX\u0302 0 .\n\n(16)\n\nEquation of motion for the X\u0302 0 gives the curl free condition for the field C and therefore, locally\nwe can solve it as C = dX\u0303 0 . By virtue of the gauge symmetry for the vector field C we can fix\nthe gauge C = 0 or X 0 = 0. In both cases the action (16) reduces to the action (5) (either in\nterms of (X 0 , X m\u0303 ) coordinates or (X\u0303 0 , X m\u0303 ) ones). In its turn the integration over the C field\nin the adapted coordinate frame leads after imposing the gauge fixing X 0 = 0 to the Buscher's\nrules (10).\n\n3\n\nT-duality in Kaluza-Klein picture\n\nAs it has been outlined in Introduction, at the level of firstly quantized string theory T-duality\ndeals with compactification and interchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK) and winding modes.

Apparently that g00 determines the\nlength of the internal circle, and therefore there is also R \u2194 1/R.\n\n4\n\nGauged sigma-model representation and T-duality\n\nLet's turn the attention to the gauged sigma-model representation of string action (eq. (16)).\nOne of the powerful points of such a representation consists in the possibility to arrive at\nthe result of integration over C field (eqs. (8) and (12)) effectively without performing the\nintegration. To this end let us regard the field C (or C\u0303 in dual picture) as additional worldvolume\nfield (as it should be), and starting from the dual string action\nS=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\nDX m \u2227 \u2217DX n g\u0303mn + 2B\u0303 (2) (D) \u2212 2C\u0303 \u2227 dX\u0302 0\n\n(21)\n\nrewrite it as\nS=\n\n6\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\n[dX m\u0303 \u2227 \u2217dX \u00f1 g\u0303\u02c6m\u0303\u00f1 + g\u030300 (dX 0 + C\u0303 +\n\ni0 g\u0303\ni0 g\u0303\n) \u2227 \u2217(dX 0 + C\u0303 +\n)\ng\u030300\ng\u030300\n\n+ 2B\u0303 (2)\u2212 (d) + 2i0 B\u0303 (2) \u2227 (dX 0 + C\u0303) \u2212 2C\u0303 \u2227 dX\u0302 0 ].\n\n(22)\n\nStrictly speaking, these are effective \"KK backgrounds\" since their form is derived from D-dimensional line\n2\n\nelements ds2 = g mn dX m \u2297 dX n and ds\u0303 = g\u0303 mn dX m \u2297 dX n by extracting X 0 coordinate and rearranging the\nterms in T-duality invariant combinations.\n\n6\n\n\fNow solving for the equation for X\u0302 0\nC\u0303 = dy,\n\n(can be gauged out)\n\nand applying the T-duality rules (20) we are left with expression (12) (in the coinciding original\nand dual coordinates basis), which was obtained from the original string action (1)\u2013(3) by use\nof equation of motion for the C field, i.e.\nS=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\ngaug.s.mod.\nLdual\n|KK T \u2212duality rules\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\nLorig.\n| orig.\n\n.\n\n\u03b4L\n\u03b4C\n\n(23)\n\n=0\n\nActually, this statement is trivial, because it says about equivalence of the original theory written\nin terms of dual variables (after resolving for the equation of motion for C field) to its dual theory\nwritten in terms of the same variables (after application of T-duality rules). However, this notion\nbecomes crucial in the consideration of T-duality in the effective action constructed out the part\nof the bosonic sector of supergravity with the fundamental string as a source.\n\n5\n\nEffective action with a string source and T-duality\n\nAfter preliminaries made in the sections before we are in position to consider the model describing\nthe effective action with string as a source for gravity and 2-form antisymmetric tensor field.\nThis action has the following form [35]\nS=\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\nMD\n\nZ\n\nMD\n\ne\u22122\u03c6\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n1\n1\nRa1 a2 E a3 . . .

The variation of this action over gmn\n(2)\nand Bmn leads to the Einstein equation for gravity with the dilaton and the NS 2-form gauge\nfield in the presence of matter source and to the equation for the NS 2-form field strength with\nthe string source\n1\n1\n1\n1 (3) (3)pq 1\nHn\n\u2212 gmn H (3)2 ) = e2\u03c6 Tmn ,\nRmn \u2212 Rgmn \u2212 (\u2202m \u03c6\u2202n \u03c6 \u2212 gmn (\u2202\u03c6)2 ) \u2212 (Hmpq\n2\n2\n2\n4\n6\n\u221a\n(\u2212)(D\u22124) \u2202m (e\u22122\u03c6 \u2212gH (3)mnp ) =\n\nZ\n\nMD\n\n\u221a \u03b4D (x \u2212 X(\u03be))\n\u221a\ndD x \u2212g\n\u2212g\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\nd2 \u03be\u01ebij \u2202i X n \u2202j X p\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nwith Tmn being the energy-momentum tensor of the string\nT\n\nmn\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nMD\n\n\u03b4D (x \u2212 X(\u03be))\n\u221a\n\u2212g\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd2 \u03be \u2212\u03b3\u03b3 ij \u2202i X m \u2202j X n .\n\nNow try to implement the consideration above to the case of the effective action (24). There\nare at least two different ways to establish the T-duality covariance.\nFollowing the first way, it is necessary to write down the source part of the action (24) in the\nfirst order form by use of worldvolume field Ci . Then, integrating out the C field, one arrives\n7\n\n\fat the T-duality transformations (14). In its turn, the bulk part of the action propagates in the\nbackground defined by the line element\nds2 = g mn dX m \u2297 dX n = \u011dm\u0303\u00f1 dX m\u0303 \u2297 dX \u00f1 + g00 (dX 0 + A) \u2297 (dX 0 + A).\nTherefore, we should put it down in the KK manner, apply the rules (20) which is equivalent to\n(14) together with the dilaton shift (cf. eq. (30)) and lift it up. This sequence leads to desired\nresult (cf. eq. (31)).\nThe second way allows one to realize the gauged sigma-model-like technique at the level of\nwhole action (24) in uniform way having in mind that string propagates in special background\nallowing for the isometry directions. To this end, as in the sections before, extend the derivatives\nto the covariant ones, i.e.\ndX m \u2212\u2192 DX m = dX m + Ck m\nwith target-space additional field C(X m\u0303 ), and insert it into the action\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u22122\u03c6\n\nMD\n\ne\n\n\u0014\n\nM2\n\n:\n\n1\n1\n1\nRa1 a2 (D)E a3 (D) . . .

This is due to the\nsymmetry under the local shifts in the isometry direction which gives a possibility to fix either\nC = 0 or X 0 = 0 gauge. As in the case of the gauged sigma-model representation of string\naction (16), eq. (27) reduces to the eq. (24).\nConsider now the first line of eq. (27) and drop out for the moment the curl free condition for\nC. Then, the background line element is defined by ds2 = DX m \u2297 DX n gmn that is equivalent\nto the following KK-type representation\nds2 = \u011dm\u0303\u00f1 dX m\u0303 \u2297 dX \u00f1 + g00 (dX 0 + C + A) \u2297 (dX 0 + C + A).\n\n(28)\n\n(D)\n\nTherefore, the symbol Lgrav.+dil.+N S2.

But as it has been pointed out in Section 2 the equation\nC = dy still holds. Therefore, effectively, (29) does not depend on C and we return to the\n7\n\nIn (27) Ci is a pullback of the bulk one-form C, i.e. Ci = Di X m Cm \u2261 \u2202i X m\u0303 Cm\u0303 since in the adapted\n\ncoordinate frame ik C = 0.\n8\nIn (29) H \u2032(3) = H (3) + d(i0 B (2) )A and the Hodge star is the (D \u2212 1)-dimensional operator.\n\n8\n\n\fsituation discussed previously in the free case.

The first\none is the standard way and it shows the influence of worldvolume duality to the target-space\nfields. The second way emphasizes the role of isometry in T-duality consideration and gives the\npossibility to realize in uniform manner the statement that both bulk and string parts of the\neffective action with source propagate in background with isometry 9 . However, following this\nway, we have to consider additional target-space field rather than the worldvolume one. Due to\nthis fact one has also to take into consideration the bulk contribution to the equation of motion\nfor this new field. It looks surprisingly that establishing the invariance under the T-duality\ntransformations sends in common to the uncoupling string case. At first glance one can expect\nto arrive to much more complicated problem especially in the part of evaluation of the solution\nto the equation of motion for the C field deriving from the action (27). However, let's analyse the\nproblem from another point of view. As in the case of uncoupling string, reviewed in Section 4,\none can start from the consideration of the action (31). Then, inserting the extended derivatives\nand gauging out the C\u0303 field, after application of T-duality rules we arrive at the intermediate\nresult, which is schematically the same as it was sketched in eq. (23) 10 . Important point is that\nthe KK gravity part in the l.h.s. of this picture does not contain any dependence on dX\u0302 0 being\ndual to the C\u0303 field. On the other hand, in view of (23), the KK gravity part in the r.h.s. is\nalso free from the dependence on dX\u0302 0 , but already with taking into account the solution to the\nequation of motion for the C field. Therefore, we conclude that no contribution comes from the\nKK gravity part to the equation of motion for the C field and therefore we can consider that\nC = dy holds as the \"Bianchi identity\" for the equation of motion for its dual.\nAlthough our consideration is restricted to the case of one isometry direction, the proposed\nconstruction generalizes straightforwardly to the case of arbitrary number of commuting isometries. In view of gauging isometries technique we may expect also that this scheme can be\nextended to the non-Abelian case.\n9\n\nOther aspects of space-time symmetry gauging in application e.g. to the KK dimensional reduction can be\n\nfound in [36].\n10\nThis result remains the same for regarding C as the bulk field as well.\n\n9\n\n\fAnother interesting problem is to apply this scheme to the case of open string and D-branes\nand to evaluate the T-duality power for the effective action in presence of the D-branes sources.\nAlso it should be very attractive to realize completely supersymmetric picture of supergravity\ncoupling with superstring as a source and to demonstrate the invariance under the (super) Tduality transformations. We hope to return to these problems in the forthcoming publications.\nAcknowledgements.
