It turns out that\non either side of the phase transition clear differences show up and in the Coulomb phase\nthe ability to remove double Dirac sheets proves vital on a small lattice.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the main practical advantages one exploits in Monte Carlo studies of lattice QCD is the\nfact that phenomenologically relevant low-energy observables (i.e. masses and matrix elements\nof operators between physical states) may be studied without a need to choose a specific gauge;\ni.e. they may be determined from gauge-invariant correlators, and hence the functional integral\nmay perform a random sampling over all gauge orbits.\nNonetheless, there are good reasons to address the question how one may transform a\ngiven ensemble of gauge configurations to a specific gauge; mainly because on such a gaugefixed ensemble gauge-dependent objects like quark- or gluon-propagators may be determined\ntoo, and the results may be compared with what one gets in perturbation theory or in other\nnon-perturbative frameworks, like the Dyson-Schwinger approach.\nAn attempt to fix a given configuration to a specific gauge raises several issues. The first\nquestion to ask is what a lattice analogue of a continuum gauge like the Lorentz condition\n\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nmight be, and the typical answer is to construct a functional on the space of lattice configurations such that its extremum simplifies in the continuum limit to (1), but the choice is, of\ncourse, not unique. The simplest option is the standard lattice Landau gauge functional\nF [{U}] =\n\n\u0011\n1\n1 X\u0010\n1 + ReTr(U\u03bc\u03a9 (x))\n8V x,\u03bc\nNc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U\u03bc\u03a9 (x + \u03bc) = \u03a9(x)\u2020 U\u03bc (x) \u03a9\u03bc (x) is the gauge transformed link variable and V = x 1,\nbut it may be worthwhile to maximize an \"improved\" functional instead (see e.g. [1]). The\nsecond (more technical) question is which procedure shall be used to search for the maximum1\nP\n\n1\n\nIf there is a unique extremum at all, i.e. if there are no genuine Gribov copies [2].\n\n1\n\n\fof a given functional like (2), since the latter represents a very high dimensional extremization\nproblem, and there is, unfortunately, no known algorithmic solution.\nIn view of this problem, Laplacian Landau gauge fixing has been proposed [3] \u2013 a method\nwhich does not directly attempt to extremize (2) but rewrites the problem such that, after\na set of local constraints is traded for a global one, the latter task may be solved exactly.\nThe advantage is that the procedure is unique, i.e. the final configuration does not depend\non the initial gauge. It has led to beautiful results in quenched SU(2), SU(3) and SU(4)\nstudies [4], but since there is no firm analytic prediction to compare with, the situation is\nnot conclusive. As a result, a good fraction of the research which tries to link the QCD\nconfinement-deconfinement phenomenon to the behaviour of specific one- or two-dimensional\ndefect structures (e.g. monopoles or vortices) deals with algorithmic issues and there is, to\ndate, no agreement on the physics lesson learned.\nIn this situation, we decided to address the question in a simpler setting, namely the pure\ncompact U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions with the standard Wilson action\nS[{U}] = \u03b2\n\nX \u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1\u2212Re(U\u03bc (x)U\u03bd (x+ \u03bc\u0302)U\u03bc (x+ \u03bd\u0302)\u2020 U\u03bd (x)\u2020 ) = \u03b2\n\nx,\u03bc<\u03bd\n\nX\u0010\n\n1\u2212cos(\u03b8\u2737 )\n\n\u0011\n\n(3)\n\n\u2737\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/g 2 , U\u03bc (x) = exp(i\u03b8x,\u03bc ) \u2208 U(1) and \u03b8\u2737 = \u03b8x,\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b8x,\u03bc + \u03b8x+\u03bc\u0302,\u03bd \u2212 \u03b8x+\u03bd\u0302,\u03bc \u2212 \u03b8x,\u03bd is the\nplaquette angle. This theory is known to have two phases [5]: For \u03b2 > \u03b2c it is in the ordered\n(\"Coulomb\") phase, for \u03b2 < \u03b2c it is in the disordered (\"confined\") phase. Contrary to what\nearly and some more recent studies indicate [6], the transition seems to be 1st order [7] with\n\u03b2c \u2243 1.01.\nWhat is important in our context is that the U(1) theory, if quantized on the torus T 4 ,\nshows the Gribov ambiguity mentioned above [8]. Several numerical studies have tried to pin\ndown the effect gauge fixing artefacts have on the mass of the \"photon\" in either phase. First,\nCoddington, Hey, Mandula and Ogilvie studied the transverse zero-momentum correlator\nC(t) =\n\n3\nXX\n\nAi (x, 0)Ai (y, t)\n\n(4)\n\nx,y i=1\n\nwhere they defined the photon field (and we follow them in this choice) through\nA\u03bc (x) = Im U\u03bc (x) = sin(\u03b8x,\u03bc ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nand they found that \u2013 at zero momentum \u2013 the \"photon\" behaves as a massless particle for\n\u03b2 > \u03b2c but as a massive one at \u03b2 < \u03b2c [9]. Thereby they confirmed an earlier result, gotten in a\ngauge-invariant approach [10]. Nakamura and Plewnia extended this work to arbitrary spatial\nmomentum, i.e. they measured the correlator\nC\u03bc\u03bd (p, t) =\n\nX\n\nA\u03bc (x, 0)A\u03bd (y, t) e\u2212ip*(x\u2212y)\n\n(6)\n\nx,y\n\nfor a few low-lying p and observed that the transverse part at \u03b2 = 1.1 deviates, for large time\nseparations, quite drastically from the perturbative prediction, if (2) is maximized through\nlocal iterative steps only [11]. They also noticed that the result improves, if the local iterative\nprocedure is extended to opt for the best one out of several attempts, and this observation\ntriggered a long stream of subsequent activities (see below).\nThe goal of the present study is to give a fair comparison between Laplacian and iterative\ngauge-fixing in the pure U(1) theory, where both phases may be considered, good statistics is\neasy to obtain and correlators involving all momenta may be determined through fast Fourier\ntransform. After a quick review of the gauge-fixing procedures, the comparison is given for the\nCoulomb and confined phases separately, and we end with a short discussion of the relevance\nof our results to the non-Abelian case.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nIterative versus Laplacian gauge fixing\n\nWe start with a brief outline of the two gauge fixing algorithms which we are going to compare\nw.r.t. the photon correlators implied.\n\n2.1\n\nStandard and modified iterative Landau gauge fixing\n\nModified iterative Landau gauge fixing is an improvement on standard iterative Landau gauge\nfixing. The latter is tantamount to iteratively passing through the lattice and trying to locally\nmaximize the gauge functional (2) which in the case of the compact U(1) theory reads\nF [{\u03b8}] =\n\n1 X\nFx (\u03b8) ,\nV x\n\nFx (\u03b8) =\n\n4 \u0010\n\u0011\n1 X\n2 + cos(\u03b8x,\u03bc ) + cos(\u03b8x\u2212\u03bc\u0302,\u03bc ) .\n16 \u03bc=1\n\n(7)\n\nIn this symmetrized version it is obvious that for a given site x the local gauge transformation\n\u03a9(x) : \u03b8x,\u03bc \u2192 \u03b8x,\u03bc + cx , \u03b8x\u2212\u03bc\u0302,\u03bc \u2192 \u03b8x\u2212\u03bc\u0302,\u03bc \u2212 cx\n\n(8)\n\nwhich maximizes Fx (\u03b8) may be found analytically. Moreover, doubling the respective c leaves\nthe local contribution Fx (\u03b8) unchanged, thus offering the possibility of an overrelaxation step:\nin practice one sweeps through the lattice in a mixed overrelaxation/maximization strategy\n[12].\nIn general, this standard procedure gets stuck in a local extremum. If the common belief\nthat the \"true\" gauge copy corresponds to the global maximum [13] is correct, an extra effort\nis needed to improve on this situation. Specifically for the case of the compact U(1) theory\ntwo types of objects are known which prevent the local iterative procedure from reaching the\ntrue extremum. Bogolubsky et al. have shown [14] that in the quest for the global maximum\none needs to suppress both the \"double Dirac sheets\" (DDS) and the \"zero momentum modes\"\n(ZMM) of the gauge field, two concepts which we shall explain in detail.\nDDS: Each plaquette angle \u03b8x,\u03bc\u03bd is decomposed into the gauge-invariant electromagnetic\nflux \u03b8x,\u03bc\u03bd \u2208 ]\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0[ and the discrete gauge-dependent part 2\u03c0nx,\u03bc\u03bd , nx,\u03bc\u03bd = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12 [15]. A\nvalue nx,\u03bc\u03bd = \u00b11 represents a Dirac string passing through the plaquette and a plaquette with\nnx,\u03bc\u03bd 6= 0 is called a \"Dirac plaquette\". A gauge-invariant monopole inside an elementary\nP\ncube is detected via its non-zero flux 2\u03c0 6 n\u03bc\u03bd . Since monopole worldlines form closed loops\non the dual lattice, the Dirac strings normally span cylindrical 2d sheets dual to the Dirac\nplaquettes. However, on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, it is also possible to form\na boundary-free Dirac sheet spanning a whole 2-torus. It represents the exceptional case of\ntwo monopole loops merging on top of each other. A pair of Dirac sheets with opposite flux\norientation carries zero action, and can be removed by a periodic gauge-transformation [16]. It\nis called a \"double Dirac sheet\" (DDS). In the confining phase, monopole worldlines percolate\n[17], and so do Dirac strings and sheets. In the Coulomb phase, monopole loops are small,\nDirac plaquettes are less abundant and DDS are rare. When they appear, they tend to lie\nparallel to the main axes, presumably for entropic reasons, since this orientation requires fewer\nDirac plaquettes. In any case, a DDS in the \u03c3\u03c1 plane may be detected by counting the total\nnumber of \u03bc\u03bd Dirac plaquettes (\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\u03c1 6= 0), which must satisfy\n(\u03bc\u03bd)\n\nNDP \u2265 2L\u03c3 L\u03c1 .\n\n(9)\n\nZMM: With periodic boundary conditions the \"zero momentum modes\" of the gauge field\n\u03b8\u03bc =\n\n1 X\n\u03b8x,\u03bc\nV x\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fdo not contribute to the action (3) \u2013 the angle of the Polyakov loop is arbitrary, indicating a\nglobal U(1) symmetry of the action. For gauge configurations representing small fluctuations\naround constant modes it is easy to see that the global extremum of the functional (7) requires\n\u03b8\u03bc = 0. The latter condition may be satisfied through a non-periodic transformation\nc\n\u03b8x,\u03bc \u2192 \u03b8x,\u03bc\n\u2261 \u03b8x,\u03bc \u2212 c\u03bc mod 2\u03c0 , c\u03bc \u2208 ]\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0[\n\n(11)\n\nwith the specific choice c\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc , but in general this is not a gauge-transformation (the Polyakov\nloop is changed). If one insists that (11) shall be a gauge-transformation, the c\u03bc need to be\nchosen from the (finite) set\n2\u03c0 4\u03c0\nc\u03bc \u2208 {0, \u00b1 , \u00b1 , . . .} .\n(12)\nL\u03bc L\u03bc\nHad we chosen the other natural definition of the gauge field, A\u03bc (x) = \u2212i log(U\u03bc (x)) = \u03b8x,\u03bc\nrather than (5), the transformation (11) with c\u03bc = \u03b8\u03bc would amount to a shift in A\u03bc (x) such\nthat its constant Fourier mode is zero. In other words, abandoning the restriction (12) amounts\nto eliminating a constant background field. While this is frequently done (see e.g. [14]), we\nfeel that sticking with the combination (11, 12), where the background is suppressed but not\neliminated, is somewhat closer in spirit to the original extremization task \u2013 choosing, out of\n(12), a non-trivial c\u03bc , amounts to switching to another point on the gauge orbit which, in view\nof the global extremum, looks more promising. In practice, one does not expect any sizable\ndifference between the two options, since on a large enough lattice the discreteness of c\u03bc turns\ninto a rather marginal restriction.\nThe \"modified iterative Landau gauge\" (modified ILG) differs from the \"standard\" ILG\ndiscussed above in that it tries to eliminate both the DDS and the ZMM as far as possible.\nTo implement it, we proceed in bunches of 100 standard sweeps through the lattice followed\nby a ZMM operation (11, 12) and a check on the DDS condition (9) which we sharpen to\n(\u03bc\u03bd)\n\nNDP \u2265 1.5L\u03c3 L\u03c1\n\n(13)\n\nto account for additional monopole-antimonopole pairs which may punch holes into the sheet.\nIn case (13) is met, the whole gauge-fixing procedure is started over from another random\npoint on the gauge orbit. This is repeated until a configuration without DDS is obtained.\nFurther bunches of 100 extremization/overrelaxation sweeps are applied until the last round\nhas increased the functional (7) by less than 10\u22128 . To prevent the program from getting\ntrapped in an infinite loop, a cut-off on the outer loop is introduced which is chosen O(30)\nin the Coulomb phase and O(10) in the confined phase (these figures are tuned to our \u03b2\nvalues, i.e. they represent an ad-hoc element in the procedure). In such a case the result of the\nrandom gauge copy which has led to the highest functional value (7) is post-iterated with local\nmaximization/overrelaxation steps to make sure that at least a local extremum is reached.\nFor reasons which will become clear later on, we decided to include the ZMM suppression\n(11, 12) in our \"standard\" ILG ensemble, too.\n\n2.2\n\nLaplacian Landau gauge fixing\n\nThe Laplacian Landau gauge fixing method [3] takes its origin from the observation that\nmaximizing (7) (we specify the discussion to the U(1) case) is equivalent to minimizing\nG[{\u03b8}] = Re(\n\nX\nx,\u03bc\n\n2 \u2212 ei\u03b8x,\u03bc \u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8x\u2212\u03bc\u0302,\u03bc )\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fand the latter means, more explicitly, to search for a gauge transformation (8) such that\nG[{\u03b8}] = Re(\n\nX\nx,\u03bc\n\neicx 2e\u2212icx \u2212 eicx ei\u03b8x,\u03bc e\u2212icx+\u03bc\u0302 \u2212 eicx e\u2212i\u03b8x\u2212\u03bc\u0302,\u03bc e\u2212icx\u2212\u03bc\u0302 )\n\n(15)\n\nis minimal. Setting \u03c6x = \u03c1x e\u2212icx , the bracket suggestively looks like the quadratic form\nX\n\n\u03c6\u2020x (\u2212\u25b3)xy \u03c6y\n\n(16)\n\nx,y\n\nand the problem (15) would, in fact, be equivalent to searching for the lowest eigenmode\nof the sign flipped covariant Laplacian, were it not for the set of local constraints |\u03c6x | = 1\n(or \u03c1x = 1) for all x. The Laplacian Landau gauge [3] ignores the latter and constructs the\ntransformation (8) from the eigenmode which corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue of (16), i.e.\nP\nit sets cx = \u2212Im log(\u03c6x ) and keeps only the global constraint x |\u03c6x |2 = 1 (because the mode\nmay be normalized).\nThe Laplacian Landau gauge (LLG) is unique, i.e. the final result does not depend on the\ninitial gauge [3], and it is unambiguous in all cases where (a) the lowest eigenmode of the\ncovariant Laplacian is non-degenerate and (b) the result satisfies \u03c6x 6= 0 for all sites x. For a\ncontinuous (i.e. interpolating) gauge field \u00c3\u03bc (x\u0303), the local ambiguities \u03c6\u0303(x\u0303) = 0 are associated\nwith Dirac sheets. For details with respect to (a/b) we refer to [3, 4] and for a discussion of\nthe relationship of LLG to Landau gauge in perturbation theory we refer to [18]. To compute\nthe lowest eigenmode of the covariant Laplacian we use the Arnoldi package ARPACK [19].\n\n3\n\nComparison in the Coulomb phase\n\nWe generate 1500 configurations on a 164 lattice at \u03b2 = 1.05, fix them with the Laplacian and\nthe modified iterative prescription and compare the results for the photon propagator.\nA gauge-invariant way to establish, for \u03b2 > \u03b2c , that the photon is massless is to measure\nthe (exponential) decay of the correlator between two planes of spatial Polyakov loops with a\nfew nonzero momenta in the spatial directions. At large enough Euclidean time separation t\none determines the effective mass meff . After introducing the lattice momentum\np\u0302\u03bc =\n\n2\np\u03bc a\n2\n\u03c0n\u03bc\nsin(\n) = sin(\n)\na\n2\na\nL\u03bc\n\n(17)\n\nand plotting meff as a function of p\u03022 and fitting with\nq\n\nmeff = m2 + p\u03022 ,\n\n(18)\n\nthe data ought to be consistent with m2 = 0. Since the available (ordinary) momenta are\npi = 2\u03c0 ni /Li and good agreement with the dispersion relation (18) typically requires p2 \u226a 1,\nthe spatial extension of the lattice needs to be large.\u221aOn our 164 lattice, results are acceptable\nfor the two lowest momenta, |p| = 1*2\u03c0/16 and |p| = 2*2\u03c0/16, as displayed in Fig. 1 (top). We\nfit the correlator with a single and a double cosh and check whether the two effective masses\nare consistent with (18) where the mass has been set to zero, which indeed they are.\nFollowing Nakamura and Plewnia [11], we repeat this in a gauge-dependent way, using our\ntwo gauge-fixed ensembles. To that aim we determine the decay properties of the transverse\nphoton-photon correlator (6), again for the same spatial momenta and with indices \u03bc = \u03bd which\npoint orthogonal to both p and the propagation direction (associated with t). The result is\ndisplayed in Fig. 1 (bottom).

From these one might determine two points of the photon dispersion\nrelation (18), but this gauge-invariant estimator is rather noisy. The same information may be gotten,\nafter gauge-fixing, with considerably reduced error bars from the photon-photon correlator with the\nrespective momenta in the modified iterative (bottom left) or Laplacian Landau gauge (bottom right).\n\nsame information about the photon dispersion relation as the Polyakov loop correlator, but\nwith much higher accuracy. This is easy to understand, since the main effect of the gauge\ntransformations is to \"unwind\" the Polyakov loop, i.e. to remove multiples of 2\u03c0 which only\ncontribute to the noise.\nThe main technical point of the present paper is that one may get more detailed information\nabout the performance of either fixing procedure by considering the complete correlator\nC\u03bc\u03bd (p) =\n\nX\n\nA\u03bc (x)A\u03bd (y) e\u2212ip(x\u2212y) = \u00c2\u03bc (p)\u00c2\u03bd (\u2212p)\n\n(19)\n\nx,y\n\nfor arbitrary four-momentum p.

Since perturbatively D\u22a5 (p2 ) \u2243 1/p2 , the\ngraphs p\u03022 D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (top) and 1/D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (bottom) are supposed to show an almost linear\ndependence. The modified ILG shows good rotational invariance, while the LLG shows a huge scatter\nof the data at a given p\u03022 (+). After the cylindrical momentum cut (\u00d7) the scatter on the r.h.s. is\nreduced (i.e. rotational invariance improves), but the IR enhancement in the Laplacian case persists.\n\nIn Fig. 2 we display our results for the Coulomb phase. Since in the weak coupling limit\nD\u22a5 (p2 ) \u2243 1/p2 , we plot p\u03022 D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (top) and 1/D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (bottom) \u2013 both of them\nafter modified iterative (left) and Laplacian (right) gauge-fixing. The striking fact is the huge\namount of scatter in the data for the Laplacian case \u2013 data for a given p\u03022 do not collapse\non a universal line, i.e. rotational invariance is seriously broken after Laplacian fixing in the\nCoulomb phase. A simple way to elaborate on this point is to apply a cylindrical momentum\ncut [20], i.e. to decompose each momentum according to p\u0302 = pk p\u03020 + p\u0302\u22a5 where p\u03020 = 21 (1, 1, 1, 1)\nand to retain only those momenta with a component orthogonal to (1, 1, 1, 1) that is smaller\nthan some constant, e.g. |p\u0302\u22a5 |2 < 0.2. Those momenta out of the full set (+) which survive this\ncut are plotted with crosses (\u00d7). For large momenta the scatter is considerably reduced, but\nfor the very low p\u03022 the cut gets less effective and the IR enhancement by which the Laplacian\ncorrelator differs from its modified iterative counterpart is unchanged. Towards the end of this\narticle evidence will be presented that the Laplacian gauge suffers from DDS, and the present\nobservation is consistent with that claim: If DDS persist in the Laplacian ensemble, then one\nwould expect rotational symmetry to be broken (remember that DDS prefer to be planar) and\nexpect low-lying momenta to be particularly affected, since DDS represent large-scale objects.\nIn order to make contact with other studies, we fit the correlator to a functional form which\n7\n\n\f4\n\n4\n\nD_long, no momentum cut\nD_long, w.

This confirms earlier findings that the LLG does not yield\na purely transverse propagator, but the longitudinal admixture seems to be much more severe (in\nparticular for small momenta) in the Coulomb phase (l.h.s.) than in the confined phase (r.h.s.).\n\nallows for some IR enhancement; we use\nD(q 2 ) = Z\n\nm2\u03b1\nq 2(1+\u03b1) + m2(1+\u03b1)\n\n(22)\n\nwith a \"photon mass\" m and an \"anomalous dimension\" \u03b1 (apart from the renormalization\nfactor Z). Then our results may be stated as follows: In the Coulomb phase the modified iterative prescription is consistent with a propagator (22) with zero mass and vanishing anomalous\ndimension, whereas the Laplacian gauge suggests a positive anomalous dimension.\nAn interesting point is to check the transversality of the propagator \u2013 we find it well\nobeyed in the modified ILG but seriously violated in the LLG. Fig. 3 shows p\u03022 Dk vs. p\u03022 for the\nLaplacian case both in the Coulomb phase (l.h.s.) and in the confined phase discussed below.\nTo test whether the modified iterative and the Laplacian prescriptions differ on a deeper\nlevel (i.e. before the photon propagator is computed), we checked the distribution of link\nangles. They produce almost indistinguishible distributions (which are very close to a Gaussian\ncentered about zero), i.e. they both comply with the perturbative preference for zero link angle.\n\n4\n\nComparison in the confined phase\n\nWe generate 1500 configurations on a 164 lattice at \u03b2 = 0.95, fix them with the Laplacian and\nthe modified iterative prescription and compare the results for the correlator (19, 5).\nFollowing the order of investigation\nin the Coulomb phase, we start with the correlator\n\u221a\nbetween gauge-fields with 1 and 2 times the minimum spatial momentum. The result is\npresented in Fig. 4. With either procedure the two correlators seem to lie on top of each other,\nindicating that the effective mass (18) is dominated by the m2 contribution. This confirms our\nexpectation that there is no massless excitation in the disordered phase, but the two graphs\nshow different slopes so that the resulting effective mass is a gauge-dependent object. Moreover,\nit need not agree with what is usually called the photon mass, namely the asymptotic mass in\nthe 1+\u2212 plaquette-plaquette correlator [10], which is a gauge-invariant quantity. The gaugedependence of the effective mass of the correlator (19) for \u03b2 < \u03b2c is also evident from Fig. 5\nand the Table below. Note finally that in the confined phase the Polyakov loop correlator is\nso noisy that in practice no signal can be extracted.\n8\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n\nunit spatial mom.\nsqrt(2) spat mom.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nunit spatial mom.\nsqrt(2) spat mom.\n0\n\nFigure 4: Field (5) correlator with with once (+) or\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\u221a\n\n2 times the minimum spatial momentum at\n\u03b2 = 0.95. This yields information about two points in the dispersion relation (18). In the confined\nphase the Polyakov loop correlator is so noisy that no signal can be extracted. The effective mass in\nthe modified iterative gauge (l.h.s.) is smaller than that in the Laplacian gauge (r.h.s.).\n\nIn order to investigate the difference between the two fixing procedures, we go through\nthe same steps as before: We consider the complete correlator (19) involving arbitrary fourmomentum p\u0302\u03bc . The result for the confined phase is shown in Fig. 5. We plot p\u03022 D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022\n(top) and 1/D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (bottom) \u2013 both after modified iterative (left) and Laplacian (right)\nfixing. Unlike in the Coulomb phase, rotational invariance is not a problem, i.e. the data for a\ngiven p\u03022 collapse on a single line in either gauge. From a qualitative point of view it appears\nthat in the confined phase (19) is less sensitive to the details of the fixing procedure. On a\nquantitative level, however, the agreement is substantially less impressive. Again, we fit the\ncorrelators to the ansatz (22), which now seems much more adequate than in the ordered phase.\nThe resulting parameters (cf. Table below) indicate that the confined phase is characterized by\na distinctly nonzero mass parameter m and a positive anomalous dimension \u03b1, but the mass\nin LLG is substantially larger than that in the modified ILG.\nAgain we check on the transversality. The modified iterative correlator is (almost perfectly)\ntransverse, the Laplacian one is not. However, the non-transversality in LLG is seriously\nreduced compared to what we found in the Coulomb phase and rotational invariance is well\nrespected in the transverse piece, too (see Fig. 3). In passing we note that these findings\nare consistent with the hypothesis (which will be discussed below) that the Laplacian Landau\ngauge lacks the ability to fully remove the DDS in the Coulomb phase \u2013 rotational invariance\nis restored in the confined phase, since the DDS percolate at the transition [17].\nFinally, we check whether any difference between the two procedures may be seen in the\ndistribution of the link angles, and here the answer is affirmative: In the confined phase, the\ndistribution after Laplacian fixing deviates much more visibly from a Gaussian than that after\niterative fixing.\n\u03b2 = 0.95\n(confined)\nall momenta\ncylind. cut\n\nmodif.

Note that the intercept, in the bottom line, of the\ncorrelator with the y-axis is larger in the Laplacian gauge than in the modified iterative case.\np\u03022 D\u22a5 (p\u03022 )\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nHaving established that on either side of the phase transition in the compact U(1) theory the\ncorrelator (19) in the modified iterative Landau gauge (ILG) differs from that in the Laplacian\nLandau gauge (LLG), it is natural to ask which are the specific properties of the gauge fixing\nprocedures which cause these differences.\nFrom the discussion of the gauge fixing procedures in sect. 2, it is clear that double Dirac\nsheets and zero-momentum modes represent the primary candidates for gauge artefacts which\nmight spoil the properties of a gauge (cf. [14]). Hence, a natural thing to try is to omit the\nDDS suppression in the iterative procedure while keeping the step which reduces the ZMM\nbackground; this is what we have introduced as our \"standard\" ILG. The result of such a gauge\nfixing is presented in Figs. 6 and 7. In the Coulomb phase, the correlators with minimum or\nnext-to-minimum spatial momentum (l.h.s. of Fig. 6) are flatter than those after modified ILG\nand LLG (cf. Fig. 1), indicating a negative m2 . This means that the DDS tend to decrease the\neffective mass (18). In the confined phase the \"standard\" iterative correlators essentially agree\nwith those in the modified iterative gauge. A more detailed picture is gotten by considering\narbitrary four-momenta, as displayed in Fig. 7. The resulting longitudinal piece is essentially\nzero, hence only the transverse part is shown. The startling observation is that the \"standard\"\n10\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n\nunit spatial mom.\nsqrt(2) spat mom.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nunit spatial mom.\nsqrt(2) spat mom.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n\u221a\nFigure 6: Field (5) correlator with with once (+) or 2 times the minimum spatial momentum in\nthe \"standard\" iterative Landau gauge at \u03b2 = 1.05 (l.h.s.) and at \u03b2 = 0.95 (r.h.s). The propagator in\nthe Coulomb phase is flatter than its modified iterative or Laplacian counterparts at the same \u03b2 value\n(cf. Fig. 1), while in the confined phase it is in good agreement with its modified ILG counterpart\nbut not with the Laplacian one (cf. Fig. 4).\n\nILG propagator shows the same amount of scatter and the same sort of IR enhancement in the\nCoulomb phase that we have seen in the case of the Laplacian correlator. On the other hand,\nin the confined phase the \"standard\" iterative propagator almost coincides with its modified\ncounterpart. This is expected, since the DDS percolate at the phase transition [17]; hence the\nefforts of the modified ILG to remove them are futile.\nIn an attempt to further substantiate the obvious suspicion that remnant DDS are responsible for the abnormal IR behaviour of the Laplacian propagator in the Coulomb phase and to\nshed light on the properties of the Laplacian gauge in the confined phase, we produce a scatter\nplot relating the value of the functional (7) to the remaining number of Dirac plaquettes in\nthe gauge fixed configuration. The result is shown in Fig. 8.\nIn the Coulomb phase the modified ILG always reaches the highest value of (7), among\nthe three gauges considered. The \"standard\" ILG reaches (almost) the same extremum on\nthe majority of configurations, but there is a considerable number of backgrounds on which\nit falls short quite drastically, and at the same time the total number of Dirac plaquettes is\nsubstantially increased. This correlation is paralleled in LLG, but there the amount by which\nit falls short (in either respect) has a continuous spectrum. In other words, the \"standard\"\nILG differs from the LLG by the gap in the functional value which separates \"success\" from\n\"failure\". Hence it looks like only a limited number of configurations causes (simultaneously\nfor the Laplacian and the \"standard\" iterative procedure) a problem both w.r.t. the gauge\nfunctional and the number of Dirac plaquettes. We checked that these are, in most cases, the\nsame configurations for both gauges. On our lattice the DDS condition (9) reads 2*162 = 512\nper plane. With a typical number of O(2000) Dirac plaquettes at \u03b2 = 1.05 in a modified\nILG configuration, one would expect a configuration with a DDS sheet to have more than\nO(2500) Dirac plaquettes. This is precisely where the gap in the number of Dirac plaquettes\nfor \"standard\" iterative fixing ends. Since the Laplacian fixing shows a continuous excess\nin the number of Dirac plaquettes, this correlation analysis cannot prove that DDS present\na problem to the LLG procedure. However, the condition (9) being met, together with our\nprevious observation that rotational invariance is seriously broken (in particular for small\nmomenta, cf. Fig. 3) is strong circumstantial evidence.\nIn the confined phase things look much simpler: Again, the modified ILG wins the competition for the extremization of the gauge functional (7). The \"standard\" ILG is in second\n11\n\n\f4\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\nD_perp, no momentum cut\nD_perp, w.

Each time the graphs for p\u03022 D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (top) and 1/D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ) vs. p\u03022 (bottom) are shown.\nIn the Coulomb phase the remaining DDS cause a massive IR enhancement which is absent in the\nmodified ILG counterpart but equally pronounced in LLG (cf. Fig. 2). In the confined phase the\nresult agrees with the modified ILG correlator (cf. Fig. 5).\n\nrank, but it is very close \u2013 both w.r.t. the functional value and the number of remnant Dirac\nplaquettes. The LLG is far off \u2013 again w.r.t. both criteria. The only surprise is by how much\nit misses the extremum and by how many Dirac plaquettes it deviates from the modified ILG.\nAgain this establishes a link to our previous finding that the LLG respects rotational invariance in the confined phase: If unresolved DDS in the Coulomb phase are responsible for the\nshortcomings of the Laplacian gauge, then one would expect, since the DDS percolate at the\ntransition [17], that rotational invariance gets restored in the confined phase while the excess\nof Dirac plaquettes remains \u2013 and this is precisely what we see.\nWhile these preliminary observations clearly show a demand for future research, we would\nlike to close with a few general remarks:\n\u2022 At first sight, it looks like some of our correlators are quite \"fuzzy\". Unlike many other\ngroups we have refrained from averaging over momenta with the same p\u03022 ; if one would\ntake the average D\u22a5 (p\u03022 ), then all propagators would become thin lines. However, as is\nobvious from the upper right plot in Fig. 2, such a procedure would only reveal a slight\nIR enhancement, and the information about the lack of rotational invariance would be\nlost. Hence we believe it is important to retain the full information about the spread of\ncorrelator points associated with a given p\u03022 .\n12\n\n\f0.96\n\n0.88\n\n0.875\n0.955\n0.87\n0.95\n0.865\n\n0.945\n\n0.86\n\n0.855\n0.94\n0.85\n0.935\n\n0.93\n1500\n\n0.845\n\nstandard iter.\nmodified iter.\nLaplacian\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n6000\n\n0.84\n28000\n\nstandard iter.\nmodified iter.\nLaplacian\n29000\n\n30000\n\n31000\n\n32000\n\n33000\n\n34000\n\n35000\n\n36000\n\n37000\n\n38000\n\nFigure 8: Correlation between the final value of the functional (7) and the number of Dirac plaquettes\nin the fixed configuration in the Coulomb phase (l.h.s.) and in the confined phase (r.h.s.).\n\n\u2022 It is not clear whether the qualitative aspects of the propagators we have studied on a\n164 grid stay invariant under a change of the lattice size. On one hand the ability of the\nILG to remove DDS through repeated attempts will degrade drastically on larger lattices;\npresumably the cut-off on the outer loop (as discussed in sect. 2) should be increased\nexponentially with the volume. On the other hand DDS on a larger lattice involve more\nDirac plaquettes and become less frequent by purely entropic suppression. Which effect\nwins is unclear. Preliminary studies on a 324 grid indicate that the Laplacian correlator\nmight be much better behaved on that lattice size \u2013 unfortunately the available statistics\nhas prevented us from reaching any conclusion. Still, our 164 lattice is much larger than\nthose which have been used in previous investigations of the modified ILG [14].\n\u2022 After dealing with so many details of which quantity correlates with which other one,\nwe wish to emphasize a simple point: We have presented evidence that all three gauges\nconsidered yield smooth configurations in either phase. At \u03b2 = 1.05 we see no differences\nin the distribution of link angles at all, whereas at \u03b2 = 0.95 the configurations tend to\nbe slightly smoother with both types of iterative fixing than in the Laplacian gauge.\nNotably, in spite of the distribution of link angles being almost indistinguishable, the\npropagators (19) on these ensembles may be strikingly different.\n\u2022 The lack of several gauge fixing procedures to reproduce the known perturbative behaviour in the Coulomb phase of the compact U(1) theory raises concerns about the\nvalidity of results for SU(2) or SU(3) in either standard iterative or Laplacian gauge.\nIf already a U(1) subgroup may cause a problem, one does not feel inclined to blindly\ntrust the result of any fixing procedure in the non-Abelian case. The mass which we have\nextracted from the gauge-fixed field correlator is not gauge-invariant (see Table 1). This\nfeature is likely to persist in the non-Abelian case below Tc . Therefore, the quantitative\nmeaning of gauge-fixed gluon mass measurements should be considered with caution.\nIt will be interesting to see whether our observation that the deconfined phase is more\nsensitive to the details of the fixing procedure carries over to the non-Abelian case, too.\nAcknowledgements: Out of the vast body of institutional addresses, one deserves to be\nhighlighted: The Institute for Nuclear Theory is where the two of us met during the program\n\"Lattice QCD and Hadron Phenomenology\" (INT-01-3) and the stimulating atmosphere genuine to this place spurred us on to complete the current project.
