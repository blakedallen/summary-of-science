We present first results of a simultaneous atmospheric turbulence\nmeasurement campaign at the Calar Alto (Spain) 1.23 m and 3.5 m telescopes.\nA SCIDAR instrument and the Calar Alto Adaptive Optics system ALFA were\nused at the 1.23 m and 3.5 m telescopes respectively to determine essential turbulence parameters like the Fried parameter r0 , the isoplanatic angle \u03b80 , and, in\nthe case of SCIDAR, the Cn2 profile of the atmosphere.

This paper shows a comparison of the results obtained\nfrom the two different systems for several times during a period of three nights.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe quality of correction and the overall quality of the images achievable by the use\nof Adaptive Optics (AO) is strongly dependent on the momentary properties of atmospheric turbulence as well as a good adjustment of instrumental parameters (such as\nspatial and temporal sampling rates) to these properties. A measure for the quality of\nthe AO correction is the shape of the point spread function (PSF) of a given instrument at a given time. Experience shows that the PSF is subject to rapid variations that\noriginate in the stochastic nature of atmospheric turbulence as well as in instrumental\nlimitations. Veran et al. (1997) have shown, that it is possible to retrieve the shape of\nan on-axis long-exposure PSF from the measurements of a curvature AO system. This\nPSF can then be used for the reconstruction and reduction of AO compensated image\ndata. Our goal is to apply a similar method to the Calar Alto AO system ALFA and\n- if possible - reconstruct the PSF not only on-axis but also to give an approximation of off-axis PSFs over the whole field of view. Additionally we want to optimize\nthe closed-loop parameter selection process by using additional information on the momentary state of atmospheric turbulence. For this purpose we conducted a measurement\ncampaign at the Calar Alto 1.23 m and 3.5 m telescopes using a SCIDAR instrument and\nALFA, respectively, in order to determine the amount of information that is encoded in\nwave front measurements as well as to establish the benefit of simultaneous SCIDAR\nmeasurements when using an AO system. The two instruments will be described more\nclosely in the next section.\n1\n\n\fWeiss, Hippler, Kasper, Wooder, Quartel\n\n2\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe Instruments\nSCIDAR\n\nSCIDAR (Scintillation Detection And Ranging) is a technique to determine vertical\nprofiles of atmospheric turbulence properties such as Cn2 (h), \u03c4o (h) and ~v(h) from pupil\nplane measurements of double star's scintillations (Rocca, Roddier, & Vernin, 1974).\nWhile the first SCIDAR instruments measured scintillation at ground level and were\ntherefore not sensitive below a given height (depending on Fresnel propagation heights)\nan improvement first proposed by Fuchs, Tallon, & Vernin (1994) that basically results in measuring scintillation patterns virtually several kilometers below ground level\nmakes ground level turbulence accessible to SCIDAR measurements. This technique is\nmostly referred to as generalized SCIDAR. The generalized SCIDAR instrument used\nin our measurements was developed and buiilt by Imperial College's Applied Optics\nGroup at Blackett Lab in London. It has a relatively simple setup and can therefore be\neasily transported. The instrument consists of a light intensifier that is fibre-coupled to\na CCD camera. The main lens is chosen such that pixel sampling in the pupil plane of\nthe telescope is approximately 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 . For the generalized SCIDAR mode, lenses\ncan be selected for different positions of the conjugate plane. Data are recorded with\na pixel exposure time of 1.0 ms and a frame rate of 305 Hz. Due to the high data rate\nand limited disk space, the measurements are written to tape and reduced later (one\n32 MByte block of data of each run is processed in near real-time in order to get an\napproximate Cn2 (h) profile). Figure 1 shows a front view of the instrument mounted on\nthe Calar Alto 1.23 m telescope.\n2.2.\n\nALFA and OMEGA-Cass\n\nALFA is a Shack-Hartmann (SH) type AO system (Hippler et al.1998; Kasper et al.2000).\nIts AO subsystem consists of the SH Wavefront Sensor (SHWFS), a 97 actuator deformable mirror and a real-time control system based on digital signal processors. The\nSHWFS is capable to correct wavefronts with a frequency between 25 and 1200 Hz,\nwhile wavefront sampling can be adjusted using a variety of lenslet arrays (Kasper\n2000). Closed-loop correction is realized by modal control of the 97-element deformable mirror (Wirth et al. 1998) with its conjugate plane in the telescope's pupil.\nNatural guide stars (NGS) or an artificial sodium layer laser guide star (LGS) can be\nused as a reference for wavefront correction. In the past we regularly achieved Strehl\nratios in the range of 20\u201330% for NGSs while with LGSs a Strehl of 20% was achieved\nonly once so far. While ALFA in NGS mode can now be used as a common user\ninstrument, LGS operation remains problematic. Hence, LGSs were not used in the\nmeasurements presented here and will in the future only be available for test purposes.\nCorrected and uncorrected images of the binaries were obtained by MPIA's OMEGACass near-infrared camera. The camera supports image plane samplings at 0.04\u20130.12\"\nper pixel with a 1024 \u00d7 1024 near-infrared HAWAII detector. All images here were\nrecorded with a sampling of 0.08\" per pixel in the infrared K-Band, hence the diffraction limited PSF is sufficiently sampled. Figure 2 shows ALFA and OMEGA-Cass\nmounted on the Calar Alto 3.5 m telescope.\n\n\fSimultaneous Measurements of r0 and \u03b80 using SCIDAR and AO\n\nFigure 1.

While\ncare was taken that most of the time the same binaries were observed with both instruments, some observations were conducted simultaneously on different objects thus\nenabling us to see if atmospheric parameters are strongly dependent on the viewing\ndirection.\n3.1.\n\nObserved Objects\n\nTable 1 lists the relevant properties of the observed binaries.

All\nframes used here were recorded with an approximate pixel sampling of 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 at a\nframe rate of 305 Hz. The mode of observation was usually to start observing a given\nbinary with normal SCIDAR and to switch lenses afterwards to get a more accurate or\ncomplete sampling of the present turbulence structure.\nData reduction was done by a combination of the methods proposed by Kl\u00fcckers\net al. (1998) and Avila, Vernin, & Cuevas (1998). First the autocorrelation of the meannormalized frames of a run is taken and summed up. Then a section parallel and an\naverage section of directions not contributing to the line of separation of the binary's\ncomponents are extracted and subsequently subtracted to obtain a profile A(r) that is\nboth background noise reduced and has its central peak eliminated. From this profile,\nthe Cn2 (h) structure of the atmosphere can be obtained by inversion of the equation:\nA(r) =\n\nZ \u221e\n\nCn2 (h)K(r, h)dh\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212h0\n\nwhere h0 is the depth of the virtual conjugate plane and K(r, h) is a kernel describing\nthe (analytical) profile produced by a layer with a Cn2 of one at altitude h. We used\na maximum entropy method (MEM) (Avila 2000) for the inversion which generally\nshowed acceptable convergence. In cases where MEM did not converge, a simple leastsquares inversion was done. This happened a few times for the second night due to the\nlimited number of data points. Figure 3 shows an autocorrelation (A.C.) profile A(r)\nalong with the Cn2 profile obtained from it by inversion of Eq. 1.\nGiven Cn2 (h), the parameters we are interested in can be calculated using (Avila et\nal. 1998)\n\"\n#\u22123/5\n\u0012 \u00132 Z\n2\u03c0\n2\nr0 = 0.423\ndzCn (z)\n(2)\n\u03bb\nand (Gonglewski et al. 1990)\n\u03b80 = 58.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bb6/5\n\n\u0014Z\n\ndzCn2 (z)z5/3\n\n\u0015\u22123/5\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the used wavelength and z is the height above the telescope.\nAlthough additional information about the turbulence, like wind speeds and a time\nconstant \u03c40 can be extracted from our data, these parameters were not yet calculated\nfor this run as their influence on r0 and \u03b80 is marginal. However, they do play an\nimportant role in selecting an appropriate temporal sampling rate for AO and will thus\nbe addressed in a later publication.\n3.3.\n\nALFA Measurements and Data Reduction\n\nALFA was used to measure wavefront gradients and mode contribution both in openloop and closed-loop. Most of the time the same binaries as with SCIDAR were\nobserved; sometimes, however, we measured a different binary for comparison purposes. Only open-loop data was used to derive r0 since the procedure is quite straightforward. ALFA was set up to measure with a sampling rate of 300 Hz and a 28subaperture (one subaperture corresponding to a size of \u2248 0.5m on the telescope pupil)\n\n\fWeiss, Hippler, Kasper, Wooder, Quartel\n\n6\n\nFigure 3.\nfrom it.\n\nAutocorrelation profile (upper) and Cn2 profile (lower) obtained\n\nkeystone SH lenslet array. The measured modes were of Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve type (Kasper\n2000). Typically around 20000 gradients were recorded during one measurement. The\nFried parameter r0 can be determined from these measurements in two distinct ways,\none involving the gradients, the other using modal covariances. Determination of r0\nfrom modal covariances involves the observation that modal covariances scale with\n(D/r0 )5/3 (Noll 1976), where D is the telescope diameter; now an iterative scheme was\napplied that resulted in an estimate for r0 (Kasper 2000). Alternatively, r0 was determined from image motion of the subaperture spots as given by the gradients (Glindemann et al. 2000).\n\n3.4.\n\nOMEGA-Cass Measurements and Data Reduction\n\nAlong with the ALFA gradient measurements, K-Band images of the binaries were\nrecorded on OMEGA-Cass. The pixel sampling was 0.08\" per pixel, appropriate to\nthe maximum obtainable K-Band resolution of 0.16\" on a 3.5 m telescope. Due to the\nbinaries brightness, exposure time for a single frame was 1 sec., but integrated frames of\nvarying length have been used here. Only closed-loop images can be used to determine\n\u03b80 .\nIn order to find an approximate value for \u03b80 , the Strehl ratio of the on-axis Son and\nthe off-axis Soff component of the binary is measured.

The ground layer is the dominant\nlayer for r0 ; we therefore expect no significant differences in the behavior of the Fried\nparameter during the observation period. The disappearing upper layer however should\nlead to an increase of the isoplanatic angle.\n4.2.\n\nFried Parameter r0\n\nFigure 5 shows the measured values of r0 . A first glance shows that it is strongly varying during a single night which is not much of a surprise. Despite the quite different\nstructure of the turbulence during the three nights as discussed in the previous section,\nthe range of variation seems to be the same. This is clearly due to the dominance of the\nstrong ground layer and possible dome seeing components of Cn2 , the higher layers being much weaker and therefore only of little importance to r0 . A second glance reveals\nthat SCIDAR r0 values generally are a little higher than their ALFA counterparts. Since\none would not expect the dome seeing to be worse in a larger dome this may be a hint\non a systematic overestimation of r0 by generalized SCIDAR. However, this conclusion\nhas to wait for the reduction of all data sets.\n\n\fSimultaneous Measurements of r0 and \u03b80 using SCIDAR and AO\n\n9\n\nFigure 6.\nIsoplanatic angle obtained from SCIDAR measurements (diamonds) and from OMEGA-Cass images (squares).\n4.3.\n\nIsoplanatic Angle \u03b80\n\nThe measurements of \u03b80 mirror the evolution of the upper turbulent layer, in remaining fairly stable over extended periods of time. As is to be expected from Eq. 3 the\npresence of the upper turbulent layer results in a relatively low isoplanatic angle of\naround 22 arcseconds during the first night and the first part of the second night. With\nits disappearance \u03b80 rises to an average of about 40 arcseconds. At a first glance the\nagreement between SCIDAR and OMEGA-Cass measurements seems to be even better\nthan for r0 . However, it has to be said that it turned out to be extremely difficult to infer\nthe isoplanatic angle from Strehl ratio measurements on binaries other than 8 Lac with\nits large separation of 22.4 arcseconds. The remaining images essentially yielded an\ninfinite \u03b80 which is clearly not sensible.\n5.\n\nConclusion and Outlook\n\nWe have shown that SCIDAR and AO measurements of atmospheric parameters yield\nsimilar results. Conclusions as for the use of SCIDAR in assisting AO observations,\nhowever, will have to wait until all data sets are reduced. In this process a rigorous\nerror analysis of both ALFA and SCIDAR measurements will be done. Although there\nare unfortunately only a few data points for isoplanacy measurements with OMEGACass, the tendency and magnitude seem to reproduce SCIDAR results. This gives us\nhope that approximate PSFs over the whole corrected field of view can really be found\n\n\fWeiss, Hippler, Kasper, Wooder, Quartel\n\n10\n\nconsidering SCIDAR data. So the first results of our measurement campaign look quite\nencouraging.\n6.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank R. Gredel and H.-W.
