Such regions include starburst galaxies, Ultraluminous Infrared\nGalaxies (ULIRGs), embedded O stars in molecular clouds, and blister H II\nregions. Infrared spectroscopy can reveal conditions in ionized,\nphotodissociated, and molecular gas. Observations combined with theoretical\n1\n\n\fcalculations reveal the temperature of the ionizing stars, T*, electron density ne,\nionization parameter U, total hydrogen density nH, and UV radiation field G0.\nThese, in turn, can yield information about the ionized, atomic, and molecular\nmass, the star formation rate, the chemical and thermal structure, elemental\nabundances, area and volume filling factors, number of stars required to produce\nthe ionization, and the number of clouds and their radii (Wolfire, Tielens, &\nHollenbach, 1990).\nUp to now H II regions and PDRs have been treated as separate regions. This\npaper presents unified H II region / PDR calculations that make interpretation of\nobservations on a self-consistent basis possible.\n\n2 Physical Picture\n2.1 Structure of Clouds with Embedded Ionizing Stars\nEvans (1999) outlines the structure of molecular clouds, or star-forming\nregions. As gravitational collapse of the cloud takes place, O stars hot enough to\nionize H create an H II region. The level of ionization of an H II region can be\ncharacterized by U, the dimensionless ratio of the flux of ionizing photons, \u03c6H , to\nnH at the illuminated face, given by:\n\nU=\n\n\u03c6H\n\n(1)\n\nnH c\n\nwhere c is the speed of light. Typical values for U vary from about 10-1 to 10-4\n(Veilleux & Osterbrock 1987).\nThese O stars are either embedded deep in the molecular cloud or form on the\nedge of the molecular cloud and create a blister-type H II Region, similar to the\nOrion Nebula (O'Dell, 2001). In the case of starbursts, the same physical\nmechanisms probably occur, only on a much larger scale.\nHydrogen makes the transition from ionized to atomic form when all photons\nwith energies h\u03bd > 13.6 eV are absorbed. Once hydrogen becomes primarily\natomic, the H II region ends and the Photodissociation Region, or PDR, begins\n(Tielens & Hollenbach, 1985). Hydrogen makes the transition from atomic to\nmolecular across the PDR. Other molecules can form after H2 since H2 is a\nprimary catalyst.\nPDRs are characterized by nH and the strength of the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV)\nfield (G0) between 6 and 13.6 eV relative to the background interstellar radiation\nfield (Habing 1968).\n2067\u00c5\n\nG0 =\n\n\u222b\n\n1.6 x10\n\n912\u00c5\n\u22123\n\nI\u03bb d \u03bb\n\n(ergs cm -2 s -1 )\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\n\fThe value of G0 strongly influences the physical conditions in PDRs (Wolfire,\nTielens, & Hollenbach, 1990; Kaufman et al., 1999). Hollenbach & Tielens (1997)\ngive a complete description of the physical processes in a PDR.\n\n2.2 Infrared Diagnostics \u2013 Theory and Observations\n2.2.1 H II Region Diagnostics\nT* and U are determined through observations of lines of more than one\nionization stage of the same element. For instance, a common diagnostic used in\nH II regions is the ratio of [Ne III] 15.56 \u03bcm to [Ne II] 12.81 \u03bcm (Verma et al.,\n2003; Giveon et al., 2002). A higher line ratio corresponds to a higher level of\nionization, corresponding to a higher T* and U. Other line ratios that can\ncharacterize the radiation field are [S IV] 10.51 \u03bcm to [S III] 18.71 \u03bcm or 33.48 \u03bcm;\n[N III] 57.21 \u03bcm to [N II] 121.7 \u03bcm or 205.4 \u03bcm line (Rubin et al, 1994); and the\nratio of [Ar III] 8.99 \u03bcm to [Ar II] 6.99 \u03bcm.\nThe electron density is determined through ratios of lines of the same ion\n(Osterbrock & Ferland 2005). The average electron energy is much greater than\nthe excitation potential for mid-infrared transitions, eliminating the temperature\ndependence of the line ratio. However, each line will have a different critical\ndensity, which makes the line ratio dependent on ne. Examples of density\ndiagnostics in the infrared are the [O III] 52 \u03bcm line to [O III] 88 \u03bcm, [S III] 18.71\n\u03bcm to [S III] 33.49 \u03bcm, and [N II] 121.7 \u03bcm to [N II] 205.4 \u03bcm (Rubin et al. 1994;\nMalhorta et al. 2001).\n\n2.2.2 PDR diagnostics\nInfrared fine-structure lines can also determine the physical conditions in the\nPDR and molecular cloud. These lines include [C II] 158 \u03bcm, [C I] 370 \u03bcm, 609\n\u03bcm, [O I] 63 \u03bcm, 146 \u03bcm, the [Si II] 35 \u03bcm, and [Fe II] 1.26\u03bcm, 1.64\u03bcm lines.\nThese are important coolants in PDRs (Hollenbach & Tielens, 1997).\nObservations of the intensity of these lines combined with theoretical\ncalculations help to determine physical conditions in star forming regions\n(Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Wolfire, Tielens, & Hollenbach 1990). Kaufman et\nal.'s (1999) calculations show how these lines vary over a wide range of nH and\nG0. The basic premise is that, by observing as many lines as possible, theoretical\ncalculations can be compared to observations to determine nH and G0. These\nthen determine such properties of star forming regions as the mass of the cloud,\nnumber of clouds, filling factor, chemical composition, and temperature.\n\n3\n\n\f2.2.3 H II Region Contributions to PDR Diagnostics\nPrevious calculations have treated the H II region and PDR separately. PDR\ncalculations typically do not consider hydrogen-ionizing radiation, and define a\nPDR as starting where H is predominantly atomic. Diagnostic emission lines are\nassumed to originate in only one of these regions.\nSome ions (for example, C+ or Si+) are present in both the H II region and PDR,\nand their lines, in this case [C II] 158 \u03bcm and [Si II] 35 \u03bcm, can form in both.\nEven the [O I] 63 \u03bcm, 146 \u03bcm lines can form in H II regions (Aannestad & Emery,\n2003). Calculations that ignore the H II region (essentially all current PDR\nsimulations) will underestimate the line intensity, leading to incorrect value of nH\nand G0. This can lead to erroneous conclusions for the physical conditions.\nIt is already known that the H II region can contribute to \"PDR\" lines.\nKaufman et al. (1999) note the need to correct observations for any possible H II\nregion emission before using their contour plots. There are several ways to make\nthis correction, both observational and computational. Petuchowski & Bennett\n(1993) and Heiles (1994) note that the contribution of the H II region intensity to\nthe [C II] 158 \u03bcm line should be proportional to [N II] 122 \u03bcm. The most\ncommon computational approach is to run a separate model of the H II region to\nestimate its contribution to a PDR diagnostic (Carral et al. 1994). They found that\nas much as 30% of the [C II] line can come from the H II region, with the greatest\ncontribution coming from low-density H II regions adjacent to PDRs. A study of\nS125 by Aannestad & Emery (2003) found that ~40% of the [C II] 158 \u03bcm and\n~20% of the [O I] 63 \u03bcm line intensity came from the H II region.\nThe overall approach of considering the two regions separately has many\ndifficulties. One is that it is nearly impossible to match boundary conditions for\ntwo separate simulations. The density of the PDR, relative to the H II region, is\nassumed to be the inverse ratio of their temperatures, \u2248102, as suggested by gas\npressure equilibrium. The transition between the H II region and PDR is not\nincluded, leading to a lack of continuity.\nDynamical processes link these two regions in nature (see Henney et al. 2005).\nThe physical properties of the PDR are a consequence of the transport of gas and\nradiation through the H II region, while the H II region is the result of the flow of\ngas through the PDR. Our approach is to compute self-consistently the\ntemperature, density, and ionization starting with the H II region and\nprogressing through the PDR.\nWe discuss computational details in Section 3 and in Appendices A, B, and C.\nIn Section 4 we describe the physical processes for a standard model that begins\nin the H II region and extends deep into the molecular cloud. Section 5 shows\nhow H II region and PDR infrared diagnostic lines vary with U, nH+, and T*,\nunder the assumption of constant pressure. We will also determine the H II\nregion contribution to commonly used PDR diagnostic emission lines. We will\n\n4\n\n\fthen show applications to our calculations in Section 6, and end with a list of\nconclusions in Section 7.\n\n3 Calculations\nWe use the developmental version of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, last\ndescribed by Ferland et al. (1998). Shaw et al. (2005) and Henney et al. (2005)\ndescribe recent advances in its treatment of H2 and dynamics.\nWe have expanded the molecular reaction network to include ~1000 reactions\ninvolving 68 molecules. We describe the molecular network in Appendix A and\nin Abel et al. (2004). Our chemical equilibrium agrees very well with other PDR\ncodes presented at the Leiden 2004 PDR workshop (http://hera.ph1.unikoeln.de/~roellig/).\nVan Hoof et al. (2004) describe the grain physics. We self-consistently\ndetermine the grain temperature and charge as a function of grain size and\nmaterial, for the local physical conditions and radiation field. This determines\nthe grain photoelectric heating of the gas, an important gas heating process, as\nwell as collisional energy exchange between the gas and dust. The rates at which\nH2 forms on grain surfaces is derived using the temperature- and materialdependent rates given in Cazaux & Tielens (2002). We include grain charge\ntransfer as a general ionization \u2013 recombination process, as described in\nAppendix B. We also treat stochastic heating of grains as outlined in\nGuhathakurtha & Draine (1989), which can affect the dust continuum shape.\nPrimary and secondary cosmic ray ionization processes are treated as\ndescribed in Appendix C. We include a rigid-rotor model for the v= 0 rotation\nlevels of CO. This predicts line intensities for the lowest 30 rotational transitions.\nOur calculations include all stages of ionization for the lightest 30 elements.\nWe use a complete model of the hydrogen atom in calculating the H I emissionline spectrum and ionization rates (Ferguson & Ferland 1997), as well as a\ncomplete model of the helium isoelectronic sequence (Porter et al. 2005).\nIonization processes include direct photoionization, charge transfer, the Auger\neffect, dielectronic, collisional, and cosmic ray ionization. In the H II region, the\nmost important of these processes is photoionization, although charge transfer\nionization can be important for some species, in particular oxygen (Kingdon and\nFerland 1999).\nWe cover the range of observed H II regions, with nH+ between 101 and 104 cm3, and U between 10-4 and 10-1. Both n + and U were incremented by 1 dex. All\nH\ncalculations stop at an AV of 100 magnitudes, ensuring that they extend deep into\nthe molecular cloud.\nWe use the non-LTE CoStar stellar atmospheres (Schaerer & de Koter, 1997)\nand vary the T* from 34,000 to 46,000 K in steps of 4,000 K. This range of T* covers\nstars roughly ranging from spectral type O8 to O5 (Vacca et al. 1996), and spans\n5\n\n\fthe calculations performed by Giveon et al. (2002). Combining this range of T*\nwith the range of nH+ and U, we have a total of 64 calculations.\nOur calculations depend sensitively on the stellar continuum. Figure 1 shows\ncontinua emitted by single stars of temperatures 33,500 K, 35,000 K, 40,000 K, and\n48,000 K, roughly corresponding to O8 to O5 stars. We assumed the\ntemperature-luminosity relation given by Vacca et al. (1996). As T* increases, the\ntotal luminosity of the star also increases. However, the Lyman continuum\nluminosity, which sets the scale of the H II region, increases far more rapidly\nthan the luminosity of the Balmer continuum, which activates the PDR. This\nmeans that, for a fixed density, the size of the H II region relative to the PDR\nincreases with increasing T*. As we discuss in Section 5.3, this has important\nconsequences to the interpretation of PDR emission-line diagnostics.\nWe use gas-phase abundances based on an average of the abundances in the\nOrion Nebula, with the complete set of abundances given in Baldwin et al.\n(1996). For the most important species, the abundances by number are He/H =\n0.095, C/H= 3\u00d710-4; O/H= 4\u00d710-4, N/H= 7\u00d710-5, Ne/H= 6\u00d710-5, and Ar/H= 3\u00d7106. We have assumed S/H= 2\u00d710-6 based on observations of starburst galaxies by\nVerma et al. (2003). The complete set of assumed fractional abundances can be\nfound in Ferland (2002).\nWe assume a galactic ratio of visual extinction to hydrogen column density,\nAV/N(H), of 5\u00d710-22 mag cm2. Grain size distributions for gas adjacent to H II\nregions, such as Orion (Cardelli et al. 1989) and starburst galaxies (Calzetti et al.\n2000) tend to have a larger ratio of total to selective extinction than observed in\nthe ISM. We therefore use a truncated MRN grain size distribution (Mathis et al.\n1977) with R = 5.5, which reproduces the Orion extinction curve (Baldwin et al.\n1991).\nWe also include size-resolved PAHs in our calculations, with the same size\ndistribution that is used by Bakes & Tielens (1994). The abundance of carbon\natoms in PAHs that we use, nC(PAH)/nH, is 3\u00d710-6. PAHs are thought to exist\nmainly in regions where hydrogen is atomic (Giard et al. 1994). We therefore\nscale the PAH abundance by the ratio of H0/Htot (nC(PAH)/nH =3\u00d710-6\u00d7\n[n(H0)/n(Htot)]).\nWe link the H II region and PDR by assuming constant total pressure. This\nequation of state includes radiation pressure, both from the stellar continuum\nand internally generated light, gas pressure, and turbulent, ram, and magnetic\npressures when appropriate (Baldwin et al. 1991; Henney et al. 2005). Constant\npressure is a first approximation to the actual flow (see Henney et al. 2005) and\nwas assumed by previous authors (Carral et al. 1994).\nWe will distinguish between the H II region and PDR contributions to an\nemission line in the following. We define the start of the PDR as the position\nwhere n(H+)/n(Htot) falls below 1% (Shields & Kennicutt 1995). Tests show that\n6\n\n\fthe relative contributions are not sensitive to smaller values of this threshold,\nwhile larger values will diminish the H II region contribution.\n\n4 A single cloud\nIn order to calculate the physical conditions in the ionized, atomic, and\nmolecular gas, we must include all relevant physical processes in each regime. In\nthis section we describe the chemical and thermal structure of a typical cloud.\nWe also describe important physical processes and their treatment. We show in\nFigures 2-15 the results of our calculations for T* = 38,000 K, U = 10-2, and nH+ of\n3,000 cm-3. Other parameters are the same as those given in Section 3.\n\n4.1 Incident and Transmitted Continuum\nFigure 2 shows the incident and transmitted continuum at three different\npoints in our calculation. These points are where the ionized hydrogen fraction\nfalls to less than 1%, the point where the H2 fraction reaches 50%, and the\nshielded face of the cloud.\nThis plot shows the importance of including emission from the H II region in\ncalculating the conditions in the PDR. The transmitted continuum at an\nionization fraction of 1% is the radiation field that is incident upon the PDR,\ngiven our definitions of these regions. Photoelectric and dust absorption in the\nH II region removes the Lyman continuum photons. Additionally, dust re-emits\nabsorbed starlight at infrared wavelengths. This causes a rise in the transmitted\ncontinuum for \u03bb > 1 \u03bcm. Deeper in the cloud, molecular dissociation, grain\nabsorption, and photoionization of species with ionization potentials less than\n13.6 eV absorb the Balmer continuum. This continuum will depend strongly on\nthe properties of the H II region, and this forms a further link between two\nregions. All radiation with wavelengths \u03bb < 1 \u03bcm is absorbed at the shielded face\nof the cloud. This leaves only cosmic rays and the infrared spectrum to heat the\ngas.\nFigures 3-7 show the ionization structure for H, O, C, Ne, and Si across this\ncloud. We use AV as our depth parameter, which is customary for PDR\ncalculations (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985) but not for H II regions. For Figure 3,\nwe show the density of H+, H0, and H2 vs AV, while Figures 4-7 show the\nionization fraction, defined as n(Xi+)/n(Xtot) vs AV. Figure 3 shows how, under\nthe assumption of constant pressure, nH increases as T decreases. For reference,\nthe depth into the H II region is given by R-R0 = 6.32\u00d71017 \u00d7AV (cm).\n\n4.2 H II Region\nThe radiation field of the ionizing source produces an H II region at the\nilluminated face. Most of the heavy elements are doubly ionized due to the high\nU (10-1.5) and T* (38,000 K). Higher-energy photons are absorbed as we approach\n7\n\n\fthe H ionization front. Species with ionization potentials greater than hydrogen\nbecome atomic, while species with ionization potentials less than hydrogen\nremain either singly (ex. C, Si, S) or doubly (ex. Ca or Sc) ionized beyond the\nionization front.\nThe ionization front occurs at an AV of ~1. Classical Str\u00f6mgren sphere theory\n(Osterbrock and Ferland 2005), predicts that the ionization front should occur at\nan AV of 1.5 for this ionization parameter and dust-to-gas ratio. The size of the\nH II region is smaller due to absorption of a portion the Lyman continuum by\ndust (Bottorff et al. 1998). Dust also strongly absorbs the L\u03b1 line. Rees, Netzer, &\nFerland (1989) and Ferland et al. (1998) discuss the solution of the multi-level\nhydrogen atom and transport of resonance line radiation.\nThe temperature (Figures 8 and 9) is determined by energy conservation.\nFigures 10-12 gives the total heating & cooling rates, and identifies important\nheating and cooling processes. Since energy is conserved, total heating = total\ncooling. We therefore only show a single rate in Figure 10. The H II region\ntemperature is ~104 K and the dominant heating / cooling processes are\nphotoionization of hydrogen balanced by fine-structure excitation of optical and\ninfrared lines of [O II], [O III], and [N II] . The single most important coolant is\nthe [O III] 5007\u01fa line.\n\n4.3 PDR\nThe transmitted radiation from the H II region (Figure 2) determines the\nconditions in the PDR. Hydrogen makes the transition from atomic to molecular\nand other molecules form, as shown in Figure 3.\nGrain physics dominates conditions in the PDR. Grain photoelectric heating is\nthe dominant heating mechanism (Figure 11), although photoionization of\ncarbon is significant. PAHs have a large abundance in the atomic hydrogen\nregion, and these small grains contribute significantly to the total heating (Bakes\n& Tielens 1994), although graphite and silicate grains are also significant. As\nFigure 9 shows, the dust temperature depends on grain type and size (van Hoof\net al. 2004). Dust also extinguishes the radiation field across the PDR.\nFigure 13 shows the cumulative emission in each line integrated from the\nilluminated face to any depth in the cloud, for [O I] 63 \u03bcm, [O I] 146 \u03bcm, [C II]\n158 \u03bcm, and [Si II] 35 \u03bcm. These lines are predominantly excited by collisions\nwith H0. Almost all emission in these four lines comes from the PDR, with a\nnegligible contribution from the H II region. Figure 12 shows that these lines are\nalso the dominant coolants in the PDR. In dense PDRs, these lines can heat the\ngas when radiative excitation followed by collisional de-excitation becomes\nimportant (see Figure 11; also Tielens & Hollenbach 1985).\nLine and dust heating is sensitive to the continuum transmitted through the\nH II region. Dust absorbs the UV continuum and re-emits it in the infrared\n(Figure 2). This H II region continuum enters the PDR and some is absorbed by\n8\n\n\flines and dust, eventually heating the gas. The dust continuum emitted by the\nH II region must be self-consistently treated if we are to correctly treat line and\ndust heating, and other processes that depend on the IR continuum. Our\ncalculations self-consistently treat these physical processes, since we calculate the\ndust continuum produced by the H II region and its effects on the PDR.\nThe dust temperatures influence molecular formation, since they are\nimportant in determining the molecular reaction rates, in particular the H2\nformation rate on grain surfaces (we use Cazaux & Tielens 2002). In addition, the\nFUV radiation field (11.2 eV \u2264 h\u03bd \u2264 13.6 eV) destroys H2 by the Solomon process.\nOur calculations can include a detailed microphysical treatment of H2 to treat the\nSolomon process (Shaw et al. 2005), although for this calculation we treat the H2\nassuming the equivalent three-level molecule (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985) and\ntreat dissociation using the self-shielding function of Draine & Bertoldi (1996).\nH2 forms quickly once all photons greater than 11.2 eV are extinguished. This\noccurs at about an AV of ~4.5.\nOther molecules form once H2 forms (Figure 14), since it acts as a catalyst for\nthe formation of other molecules through a series of ion-molecule reactions\n(Prasad & Huntress 1980). A complete description of the molecules considered\nin our reaction network is given in Appendix A. The second-most abundant\nmolecule that forms after H2 is CO. Shortly after H2 forms, carbon makes the\ntransformation from C+ to CO (with a small amount of C) at an AV of ~8. Figure\n13 also shows the integrated emission in the lowest three rotational transitions\nfor CO.\n\n4.4 Molecular Cloud\nThe gas is predominantly molecular deep in the cloud. CO forms at the point\nwhere its electronic bands are well shielded and other molecules form in deeper\nregions. The most important are N2, O2, H2O, OH, SO, and CN. All molecules\nreach their asymptotic abundances by an AV of ~30.\nCO collisional excitation is the primary coolant in the molecular gas (Figure\n12). Both 12CO and 13CO are included in our calculation, and both contribute to\nthe total cooling.\nThe gas is heated primarily by grain collisions. Figure 15 a-b shows the grain\nopacity and the transmitted continuum in the 1-100 \u03bcm range at an AV of 20. The\nintegral of these two quantities is proportional to the local heating of each grain\nspecies. In the 10-40 \u03bcm range, the silicate opacity is considerably higher than\nthe graphite opacity. Absorption of the infrared continuum by silicate grains\ncauses the silicates to be hotter than other gas constituents. In the molecular\nregion the gas and graphite grains have T \u2248 45 K while the silicates are typically\n5 K hotter. Collisional energy exchange between these cooler constituents and\nthe warmer silicates then heats the gas. In addition to grain collisions, line de9\n\n\fexcitation and cosmic ray ionization makes a small contribution to the total\nheating.\n\n5 Results and Discussion\n5.1 Density\nHere we present the results of our grid of calculations, spanning a wide range\nof U, T*, and nH+. Here nH+ is just the ionized hydrogen density at the\nilluminated face, which for all calculations is also nH at the illuminated face.\nOur results are presented as a series of contour plots (Figures 16 \u2013 33). The\nvalue of nH+ at the illuminated face (and hence the initial value of nH) is the x-axis\non the contour plots. Figure 16 and Figure 17 shows the total hydrogen density\nat two important depths. Figure 16 shows nH at the point where the ionized\nhydrogen fraction falls to less than 1%. In general, nH at this point has increased\nby a factor of ~5-20, corresponding to the decrease in temperature from ~104 K in\nthe ionized region to 500-2,000 K at the start of the PDR. Figure 17 shows nH at a\ndeeper point, where the fraction of hydrogen in the form of H2 exceeds 90%.\nMost PDR lines will have fully formed by this point, where T ~ 100 K and nH has\nincreased by about two orders of magnitude. Although not plotted, there is an\nadditional increase in nH in deeper regions as other molecules, such as CO, form\nand the gas becomes even colder.\nMost PDR calculations assume a constant nH, so no direct comparison is\npossible between the density in our calculations and the density used in PDR\ncalculations. The densities shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17 are close to the\nlower and upper limits to nH that would be used in equivalent constant-density\nPDR calculations. For example, consider a case where T* = 38,000 K,\nnH = 100 cm-3 and U = 10-2. This set of parameters yields an nH at the face of the\nPDR of ~2\u00d7103 cm-3 and ~2\u00d7104 cm-3 when all hydrogen is in the form of H2. The\naverage density in the PDR falls somewhere in between.\n\n5.2 H II Emission Line Diagnostics\nIn this section, we discuss our results for infrared emission lines that are\nproduced in the ionized gas.\nFigure 18 to 21 show our ratios involving different stages of ionization of the\nsame element. We will use R (X) numer\ndenom as shorthand notation for all line ratios.\nHere X refers to the element, and numer/denom refers to the wavelengths of the\nupper and lower ionization stages. The four line ratios we calculate\n18.7 \u03bc m\n57 \u03bc m\n57 \u03bc m\n\u03bcm\nare R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m , R (S)10.5 \u03bc m , R (N)122 \u03bc m , and R (N) 205 \u03bc m . Observations of these\nemission-line ratios can determine T* and U. These two parameters in turn yield\n\n10\n\n\finformation on the total flux of ionizing photons, the number of stars required to\nproduce the observed level of ionization, and the age of the starburst.\nEach figure shows several general trends. Each ratio is sensitive to both U and\nT*. As T* increases, the incident continuum produces more high-energy photons,\nleading to greater production of Ne2+, N2+, and S3+, which leads to stronger\nemission from these species. The results are very similar for a T* of 42,000 K and\n46,000 K. In the case of the nitrogen lines, the critical density of the [N III] 57 \u03bcm\nline is ~2.7\u00d7102 cm-3, so collisional de-excitation effects become important for\nlarger densities. This is not the case for the neon and sulphur lines, whose\ncritical densities exceed 104 cm-3. Figure 18 and 19 show that, for the range of nH+\nconsidered here, the Ne and S ratios depend only on T* and U.\nRatios of lines emitted by the same ion are sensitive to density rather then T*\n52 \u03bc m\n\u03bcm\nor U. Figure 22 shows three such density diagnostics, R (S)18.7\n33.5 \u03bc m , R (O)88 \u03bc m ,\n\u03bcm\nand R (N)122\n205 \u03bc m , for T* = 38,000 K. The contours are nearly vertical, confirming\n\ntheir utility as density diagnostics. Note that nH+ is, to within 10%, ne in the H II\nregion.\n\n5.3 PDR Emission Line Diagnostics\nCalculated intensities (in units of erg cm-2 s-1) of common PDR diagnostic\nemission lines are shown in Figure 23-26. Shown are the predicted intensities of\nthe [O I] 63 \u03bcm, [O I] 146 \u03bcm, [C II] 158 \u03bcm, and [Si II] 35 \u03bcm lines. Observations\nof these lines can be combined with theoretical calculations to determine nH and\nG0 (Wolfire et al. 1991; Kaufman et al. 1999). This in turn helps to determine the\nmass of the molecular and atomic gas, number and radii of clouds, chemical and\nthermal structure, and the volume-filling factor. Figure 27 shows the\ndependence of G0 on U and nH. G0 scales linearly with both parameters because\nit is proportional to the flux. Additionally, G0 does not depend strongly on T*.\nComparing Figures 23-26 with Figure 27 shows that the line intensities closely\nfollow the UV flux, as expected. These figures give line intensities rather than\nline ratios, and are directly applicable for nearby resolved PDR regions. Line\nratios must be used for observations of extragalactic sources, which are not\nspatially resolved. Figure 29 and 29 give the ratio of [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [O I] 146 \u03bcm,\nand the ratio of [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [C II] 158 \u03bcm. These include contributions from\nthe ionized gas in addition to the PDR.\n\n5.4 Ionized Gas Contributions to PDR Emission\nWe show in Figure 30-33 the percentage contribution of emission from the\nionized gas to the PDR diagnostic lines shown in Figure 23-26.\nThe ratio G0 / nH and T* are the two most important factors that determine the\ncontribution from ionized gas to PDR lines. The emission lines shown in Figure\n23-26 are generally excited by H0 collisions in the PDR. The ratio G0 / nH\n11\n\n\fdetermines the size of the atomic region. For high values, H2 is photodissociated\nto a larger depth and the size of the atomic hydrogen region is large, while H2\nforms quickly for small values. T* is important because it determines the\ncontinuum shape, and hence the ratio of the flux of UV photons to the flux of\nhydrogen-ionizing photons. For regions with a large H II region but a small\natomic region, a larger fraction of the PDR line will form in the H II region. As a\nresult, the predictions depend on the continuum shape.\nBy combining Figures 1, 27 with 30-33, we can understand the contribution\nfrom ionized gas to PDR emission lines. As T* increases, more hydrogen ionizing\nflux is generated relative to G0 (see Figure 1 and 27). This increases the amount\nof ionized gas relative to the atomic gas. The relative increase in ionized to\natomic gas causes more of the total PDR diagnostic line emission to come from\nthe H II region. We find that for T* > 42,000 K, combined with G0 < 100, at least\n10% of the emission from all four PDR diagnostic lines considered emerges from\nthe ionized gas. For the [O I] lines there is a good correlation between the\nrelative sizes of the H II region and the atomic region and the contribution to the\n[O I] lines from the ionized gas. The ionization structure of O closely follows that\nof H since the two are strongly coupled by charge transfer, and their ionization\npotentials are nearly equal. The contribution of the ionized gas is greater for the\n146 \u03bcm line. The 63 \u03bcm line is always stronger in the PDR due to its lower\nexcitation potential while the lines have similar intensities in the H II region.\nThe [Si II] 35 \u03bcm and [C II] 158 \u03bcm emission from the ionized gas is significant\nover a wider range of U, nH+, and T*. The ionization potentials of atomic carbon\nand silicon are less than 13.6 eV so the first ions are present in both regions. At\nleast 10% of the 35 \u03bcm emission and 5% of the 158 \u03bcm emission comes from the\nionized gas. We still see the general trend that higher T* combined with a lower\nUV flux produces more total emission from the ionized gas.\nWe should note once again that our calculations all assume that the ionized,\natomic, and molecular gas are in pressure equilibrium. The equation of state is\ndominated by gas pressure since turbulent and magnetic pressures are not\nincluded. If turbulent or magnetic pressure dominates then the density law will\nbe different. We further assume a static geometry. Currently an effort is\nunderway to incorporate dynamics into our calculations. This will allow us to\ntreat the dynamical interaction of H II regions with molecular clouds. As\nexplained in Bertoldi & Draine (1996), when advection is included, the ionization\nand molecular dissociation front can merge. The predicted size of the ionized\nand atomic regions will change, making the ionized region larger compared to\nthe atomic region. As our calculations above show, this will lead to a larger\ncontribution of the ionized gas to PDR diagnostics. This is an important future\narea of study to interpret fully the emission line spectra of star-forming regions.\n\n12\n\n\f6 Applications to Observations\nOur calculations have many applications to astrophysical environments. Most\nimportantly, we have outlined a methodology where we self-consistently\ncalculate the emission-line spectrum of the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas\nalong with continuum emission from the dust.\nObservations of lines from different ions of the same element determine T*\nand U (Figures 18-21), while line ratios from the same ion can determine the gas\ndensity (Figure 22). For our assumed equation of state (constant pressure), T*, U,\nand nH+ also determine the conditions in the PDR. Consider an example. For T*\n= 38,000 K, U = 0.01, and nH+ = 100 cm-3, we can use Figures 16, 17, and 27 to\ndetermine nH and G0 for the atomic and molecular gas. Of course, we can also\ninvert this logic. If one makes observations of PDR emission lines, we can\ndetermine G0 and nH in the PDR. We can then use Figures 16, 17, and 27 to\ndetermine what values of U and nH+ reproduce the observations.\nWe next apply our calculations to some of the early-published results of the\nSpitzer mission. Below are examples of extragalactic observations where we\ndeduce some physical characteristic of the region of interest by comparing our\ncalculations to the observed spectral features.\n\n6.1.1 NGC 253\nNGC 253 is a starburst galaxy with a wealth of infrared observations.\nPrevious works by Carral et al. (1994), Verma et al. (2003), and Devost et al.\n(2004) have deduced abundances, T* (34,500 \u00b1 1,000) K, Q(H) (1053.2 photons s-1),\n-3\n4\n-3\nG0 (~2\u00d7104), ne (430 +\u2212290\n225 cm ) and a density of the atomic gas of 10 cm .\nAdditionally, Carral et al. (1994) find that the ionized and atomic regions are in\ngas pressure equilibrium.\nSince NGC 253 is in gas pressure equilibrium, we can use our methodology to\ncalculate the conditions in the ionized and atomic gas simultaneously.\n\u03bcm\nComparing Figure 22 to the observed ratios R (S)18.7\n33.5 \u03bc m of 0.5 (Verma et al., 2003)\n52 \u03bc m\n+\n-3\nand R (O)88\n\u03bc m of ~1-2 (Carral et al. 1994), we find nH of ~100-200 cm ,\n\n\u03bcm\nsignificantly lower than the previous results. The observed ratio R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m of\n\n0.14 \u2013 0.2 (Devost et al. 2004), together with their T* corresponds to U ~0.01.\nLet us now consider the PDR diagnostic lines. We will adopt 0.01 for U,\n34,000 K for T*, and 150 cm-3 for nH+. Figure 29 shows that the predicted ratio of\n[O I] 63 \u03bcm to [C II] 158 \u03bcm (~1), for the derived U and nH+, is in excellent\nagreement with the observed ratio of 0.8-1.1 (Carral et al. 1994). Our calculations\nsuggest that G0 is ~5\u00d7103 (Figure 27), about four times lower than what Carral et\nal. (1994) deduce. Had we used ne = 430 cm-3, as deduced by Carral et al. (1994)\nrather than the density derived from the [S III] lines, we would have obtained\ntheir G0. However, this would then overestimate the [O I] to [C II] line ratio by a\n13\n\n\ffactor of 3. Using Figure 16 and 17, we estimate an nH in the PDR of 2,000 -20,000\ncm-3. The density derived by Carral et al. (1994) of 104 cm-3, lies within the range\nof densities we derive.\nWe wish to highlight two important points regarding our analysis of\nNGC 253. First, T* and two H II-region line ratios determine U and nH in the\nionized, atomic, and molecular gas. Calculations with these parameters\nreproduce the observed [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [C II] 158 \u03bcm PDR line ratio. This\nsupports the conclusion by Carral et al. (1994) that NGC 253 is in gas pressure\nequilibrium. Secondly, for our values of U and nH+, we find that ~30% of the\n[C II] 158 \u03bcm line and 20% of the [Si II] 35 \u03bcm line are produced in the ionized\ngas. Carral et al. (1994) found a similar estimate of the contribution of the H II\nregion to the [C II] line. Had we ignored the H II region, we would have\noverestimated the [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [C II] 158 \u03bcm line ratio by a factor of ~1.4,\nresulting in a lower G0 and nH in the PDR. This would have led to large\nuncertainties in conditions derived with these two parameters.\n\n6.1.2 NGC 7331\nNGC 7331 is a nearby spiral galaxy observed by Spitzer as part of the SINGS\n\u03bcm\n18.7 \u03bc m\nsurvey (Smith et al. 2004). They observed R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m and R (S) 33.5 \u03bc m , together\nwith the lowest three rotational lines of the ground vibrational state of H2. They\nderived densities in the ionized and atomic region of < 200 cm-3 and 5000 cm-3,\nrespectively. They found G0 ~102-103 based on the H2 lines and the dust\ncontinuum, and conclude that the region is in pressure equilibrium.\nFollowing the same procedure as NGC 253 we compared our calculations with\n\u03bcm\nSST observations. According to Figure 22, the observed ratio R (S)18.7\n33.5 \u03bc m of 0.4-0.67\nindicates nH+ < 200 cm-3, in agreement with Smith et al. (2004). We therefore\n\u03bcm\nadopt a value of 150 cm-3, which gives R (S)18.7\n33.5 \u03bc m =0.55. Unfortunately, we do not\n\u03bcm\nhave an estimate of T*. The observed R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m of 0.64\u20130.75 implies, from Figure\n\n18, that T* > 34,000 K. This is because T* \u2264 34,000 K requires that U > 10-1, an\nunlikely result. Assuming Smith et al.'s (2004) G0, Figure 27 combined with\nFigure 18 implies T* < 38,000 K. We therefore assume T* = 36,000 K \u00b1 2,000 K.\n\u03bcm\nAssuming this value of T*, we vary U to reproduce the observed R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m . Our\n\u03bcm\n18.7 \u03bc m\nresults were: Log[U] = -2.5; R (Ne)15.5\n12.8 \u03bc m = 0.68 (0.64\u20130.75); R (S) 33.5 \u03bc m = 0.55 (0.40-\n\n0.67); G0 = 9\u00d7102 , nH (PDR) = 3\u00d7103 cm-3, and nH (H2 fully forms) = 4\u00d7104 cm-3.\nThe values of U and T* are new to this work, the other parameters are in\nagreement with Smith et al. (2004).\n\n14\n\n\f7 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have done the following:\n\n\u2022 We expanded the plasma simulation code Cloudy to include a\n~1000 reactions 68 species molecular network, including its effects\non the ionization and thermal balance. Our treatment of sizedresolved grains and PAHs are described by van Hoof et al. (2004).\nThese calculations can be applied to starbursts, ULIRGs, and O stars\nembedded in molecular clouds, as well as blister H II regions.\n\n\u2022 We computed the ionization, thermal, and chemical structure of a\nlarge number of clouds, assuming constant gas pressure to relate the\nH II region and PDR. We present grids of results that show how\nemission lines vary over a wide range of T*, nH+ and U.\n\n\u2022 We predict the contribution of the H II region to PDR emission-line\ndiagnostics. We find that the contribution from the ionized gas is\nmore important for low-density, low-G0 regions. The H II region\ncontributes a larger percentage of the line emission when T* is high,\nsince this increases the size of the H II region relative to the PDR.\n\n\u2022 We use our calculations to determine the conditions in two starforming regions: NGC 253 and NGC 7714. Analysis of the full\nspectrum, including lines from both the H II region and PDR, can\nself-consistently determine physical conditions.\n\n\u2022 It will be possible to use H II region and PDR line ratios to\ndetermined densities in each region. When combined with either\ntheoretical or observational measures of the gas temperature, the\ngas pressure can be obtained in each region. This can then test\nwhether the cloud equation of state is dominated by gas pressure, as\nseems to be the case in the two objects analyzed here, or whether\nother pressure terms, perhaps magnetic pressure (Heiles & Crutcher\n2005), dominate. The latter is frequently found across the galaxy.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 N.P.A would like to acknowledge the Center for\nComputational Sciences at the University of Kentucky for computer time and\nfinancial support through a CCS fellowship.

One of the major improvements to\nthe spectral synthesis code Cloudy is upgrading the molecular network in\nCloudy. This network consists of ~1000 reactions, which predict abundances for\nthe following 68 molecules:\nH2, H2*, H2+, H3+, HeH+, CH, CH+, OH, OH+, O2, CO, CO+, H2O, H2O+,O2+,\nH3O+,CH2+,CH2,HCO+,CH3+, SiH2+, SiH, HOSi+, SiO, SiO+, CH3, CH4, CH4+,\nCH5+,N2, N2+, NO, NO+, S2, S2+, OCN, OCN+, NH, NH+, NH2, NH2+, NH3, NH3+,\nNH4+, CN, CN+, HCN, HCN+, HNO, HNO+, HS, HS+, CS, CS+, NO2, NO2+, NS,\nNS+, SO, SO+, SiN, SiN+, N2O, HCS+, OCS, OCS+, C2, and C2+.\nWe solve a system of linear, time steady equations for the molecular\nabundances (Atkins 1998). Consider a reaction of the form:\naA + bB \u2192 cC + dD\n(A1)\nHere A, B, C, and D can be a molecule, atom, electron, or a photon and the\nlowercase letters are the stoichiometric coefficients. This reaction has the rate:\n\n\u2212 kn ( A ) n ( B ) =\n\n1 dn ( A ) 1 dn ( B )\n1 dn ( C )\n1 dn ( D )\n=\n=\u2212\n=\u2212\n(cm-3 s-1)\na dt\nb dt\nc dt\nd dt\n\n(A2)\n\nMany reactions will create or destroy a given species, and so the total rate of\nchange of each species will be a sum over many reaction rates.\nWhen the reaction rate contains the product of two densities, both of which\nare unknown, the equations are non-linear. We can linearize the rate by making\nthe difference between the old and new solution small. We assure this by\nchoosing the zone thickness \u03b4r so that the conditions in adjacent zones never\nchange by more than a set tolerance.\nUsing as an example the reaction rate from above, \u2212 kn ( A ) n ( B ) , we can define\nthe difference between the old and new solution as:\n\u2206 A, B = n ( A, B )new \u2212 n ( A, B )old\n\n(cm-3)\n\n(A3)\n\n16\n\n\fThe subscripts new and old refer to the current (unknown) solution and the\nprevious (known) solution, respectively. In this notation, n ( A, B )new is the\ndensity that goes into the reaction rate. Using A3, the reaction rate becomes:\n\u2212 kn ( A ) n ( B ) = \u2212k \u23a1\u23a3( \u2206 A + n ( A ) ) ( \u2206 B + n ( B ) ) \u23a4\u23a6 =\n\u2212 k \u23a1\u23a3 \u2206 A \u2206 B + \u2206 A n ( B )old + \u2206 B n ( A )old + n ( A )old n ( B )old \u23a4\u23a6 =\n\n(cm3 s-1)\n\n(A4).\n\n\u2212 k \u23a1\u23a3 n ( A )new n ( B )old + n ( A )old n ( B )new \u2212 n ( A )old n ( B )old \u23a4\u23a6\nThe last term was derived by ignoring terms to second order in delta. This\nexpression for the rate coefficient now is linear, and allows for a solution through\nstandard matrix inversion methods.\nThe chemical network is sensitive to details. We have included a complete\ntreatment of the H2 molecule in Cloudy (Shaw et al., 2005). This determines\npopulations of 1893 levels producing 524,387 emission-lines, along with a\ndetailed treatment of the self-shielding of H2 electronic transitions. We also use\nother self-shielding functions. The calculations presented in this paper use the\nself-shielding function of Draine & Bertoldi (1996). Like H2, CO is destroyed by\nabsorption in electronic transitions, which we treat by using the dissociation rate\ngiven by Hollenbach, Takahashi, & Tielens (1991) with a rate coefficient derived\nby van Dishoeck and Black (1988). We determine the abundance of excited H2\n(H2*) following Tielens & Hollenbach (1985). In this approach, reactions form\nboth H2 and H2*, with the temperature barrier removed for reactions with H2*.\nExcited H2 is very reactive, and, at shallow depths where the Solomon process\nproduces a large population in H2*, its inclusion changes chemical equilibrium.\nIn deeper regions, where H2 is well shielded, nearly all H2 is in the ground state.\nWe can include the effects of CO depletion on grain surfaces, using the\ntreatment given in Hasegawa & Herbst (1993), but did not treat this process in\nour calculations.\nWe use the UMIST database (Le Teuff, Millar, & Markwick, 2000) for the vast\nmajority of our rates. There are exceptions, however. For instance, an important\nreaction that forms CO involves C+ and OH\n\nC+ + OH \u2192 CO + + H\n\n(A5)\n\nC+ + OH \u2192 CO + H +\n\n(A6).\n\nIn UMIST, these reactions have a rate, k = 7.7\u00d710-10 cm-3 s-1, which does not\ndepend on T. Table 1 of Dubernet et al. (1992) shows that, over their range of\nstudy, T < 100 K, the rate does depend strongly on T. We have derived a power\nlaw fit to the Dubernet et al. (1992) data, which fits their data for T < 100 K.\nWritten in the same format as the UMIST, our derived rate is:\n\n17\n\n\f\u22120.3508\n\n\u239b T \u239e\nk = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 \u239c\n[cm3 s-1]\n(A7)\n\u239f\n\u239d 300 \u23a0\nFor the important charge transfer reactions between O and H, we use rates\nbased on Stancil et al. (1999) that extends to T = 107 K. For H + + O \u2192 H + O + , the\nUMIST rate diverges from the rate derived by Stancil et al. for T > 10,000 K, while\nthe reaction H + O + \u2192 H + + O diverges for T > 41,000 K. Cloudy is widely used\nto calculate conditions in hot plasmas, so it is necessary to have rates that extend\nover all physical regimes.\nWe compute photo-interaction rates by integrating the local continuum over\nthe photo cross section, as\n\n4\u03c0 J\u03bd\n\u03c3\u03bd d\u03bd\n[s-1]\n. (A8)\nh\u03bd\nHere the integral is over the relevant photon energies, \u03c3\u03bd is the photo-cross\nsection, and J\u03bd is the local radiation field (Figure 2). This radiation field includes\nthe attenuated incident continuum and diffuse emission produced within the\nH II region and PDR. This allows such processes as photo-interactions with L\u03b1\nor the IR continuum produced by hot grains in the H II region to be selfconsistently included.\nTwo important rates, H radiative recombination and He charge transfer\nrecombination with H, are significantly different from the UMIST database. The\nUMIST rate of reaction RH for H + + e \u2192 H + h\u03bd is:\nk=\u222b\n\nH\nrad \u2212 rec\n\nR\n\n= 3.50 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221212\n\n\u239b T \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d 300 \u23a0\n\n\u22120.75\n\n10 < T < 20,000\n\n[cm3 s-1]\n\n(A9)\n\nThis differs from the exact rates computed by Ferland et al. (1992) by ~30% for\nT < 100 K. This is important because, even though H+ is only a trace species in a\nPDR, its absolute abundance is large. It can be a significant electron donor, and\nthis affects molecular reaction rates and therefore molecular formation. An\napproximation to the radiative recombination rate, over the UMIST T range, is:\nH\nrad \u2212 rec\n\nR\n\n= 3.50 \u00d710\n\n\u221212\n\n\u239b T \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d 300 \u23a0\n\n\u22120.75\n\n\u2212 3.0 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221212\n\n\u239b T 1.05 \u239e\n\u239c\n\u239f\n\u239d 40 \u23a0\n\n\u22121.3\n\n[cm3 s-1]\n\n(A10)\n\nThe first term is just the UMIST rate, while the second term is a correction factor\nthat allows for better agreement at low T. Figure 34 shows how the Cloudy\nrecombination rate, UMIST rate, and the best fit to the Cloudy recombination\nrate vary over the range 10-20,000 K. The rate becomes negative for T < 2 K. The\nlower bound of T for most UMIST rates is 10 K, so our rate is stable over the\nrange covered by UMIST.\n\n18\n\n\fThe UMIST rate for the charge transfer process He+ + H \u2192 H + + He is a factor\nof 4 too large. This rate in UMIST should be:\n0.18\n\n\u239b T \u239e\nR\n= 1.21\u00d7 10 \u239c\n[cm3 s-1]\n(A11).\n\u239f 10 < T < 1000\n\u239d 300 \u23a0\nThe original rate was derived by Zygelman et al. (1989), while Stancil et al. (1998)\ngive the correct rate. Charge transfer recombination of He with H is the main\nformation process for He0 at the illuminated face of a PDR. The large rate leads\nto a factor of four decrease in the density of He+, affecting the abundances of\nother molecules due to reactions of He+. This primarily affects molecular\nabundances for low AV, or translucent clouds. For high AV, the abundance of H0\nis significantly less. This makes this rate less important at high AV.\nHe\nch \u2212 tr\n\n\u221215\n\n19\n\n\fAppendix B\nCharge and Energy Exchange of Gas and Dust\nWhen an atom or ion collides with a grain particle, there is a possibility that an\nexchange of electrons occurs. We will assume that the atom or ion has charge Z\nbefore it hits the grain, and that after the charge exchange it leaves the grain with\ncharge Z0. The value of Z0 is determined by assuming that electrons always\nmove into the deepest potential well (i.e., the exchange is always exothermic).\nThis implies that electrons can move in either direction, although in most cases\nthey will move from the grain into the ion. The exchange of electrons will\ncontinue until the next exchange would have been endothermic. The ion charge\nwhere this condition is reached is by definition Z0. This definition is deceptively\nsimple as the depth of the potential well of the grain and the ion must be\nreevaluated each time an electron is exchanged. Expressions for the grain\npotential were taken from Weingartner & Drain (2001) and will be discussed in\nmore detail in a forthcoming paper. In most cases Z0= 0, but for third and fourth\nrow elements with low ionization potentials there may be exceptions. Note that\nZ0 depends on A and Z, as well as the change of grain Zi. The rate (per unit\nprojected grain surface area) for this process is given by\nn\n\n\u03b1 p ( A, Z \u2192 Z 0 ) = N A, Z \u03bd A S p \u2211 fi\u03b7 Z , with Z \u2265 0, [cm-2 s-1]\n\n(B1)\n\ni =1\n\nwhere fi is the fraction of the grains that have charge Zi (see van Hoof et al. 2004\nfor a detailed discussion of the way the grain charge distribution is derived). NA,Z\nis the number density of the incoming ion, AZ+, \u03bd A is the average velocity of that\nion, and S p is the sticking probability for atoms and ions (assumed to be 1 when\n\nZ \u2260Z0). When an ion approaches a charged grain, there will be either attraction\nor repulsion depending on the sign of the charges. This Coulomb interaction will\neither magnify or diminish the collisional cross section, an effect which is\ndescribed by the factor \u03b7 Z \u2261 J (\u03c4 ,\u03bd ) . We use the expressions given in Draine &\nSutin (1987), which include polarization effects in the grain induced by the\napproaching particle. This theory needs two scaling parameters \u03c4 and \u03bd which\nare simply the ratio of the two charges (\u03bd ) and of the kinetic energy of the\napproaching particle and the potential energy of the grain ( \u03c4 ). These parameters\nare given by\n\n\u03c4=\n\n4\u03c0\u03b5 0 akTe\n\n( Ze )\n\n2\n\n(B2)\n\n20\n\n\f\u03bd=\n\nZi\nZ\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere a is the radius of the grains, and the rest of the symbols have their usual\nmeaning.\nCharge exchange between grains and negatively charged ions as well as\ncharged molecules is currently not implemented. These will be added at a later\ndate.\nThe Cloudy treatment of collisional heating or cooling of the gas due to\ncollisions with the grains was first described in Baldwin et al. (1991). The\nformulation given in that paper has been largely retained, with the following\ntwo exceptions. It is now assumed that the outgoing particle has charge Z0\ninstead of always being neutral, as was outlined above. Secondly, the\nCoulomb interaction between the ion and the grain is treated using expressions\nfrom Draine & Sutin (1987). The factor \u03b7 Z needed in that formulation has\n\u223c\nalready been discussed, the factor \u03beZ has been replaced by \u039b (\u03c4 ,\u03bd ) / 2 . Since the\nheating rates of the gas depend on the grain charge, all changes to the charging\nphysics will affect the heating rates as well. These changes have been partially\ndiscussed by van Hoof et al. (2004) and largely follow Weingartner & Draine\n(2001).\nThe most important changes with respect to Baldwin et al. (1991) are the\nintroduction of the hybrid grain charge model (which includes a minimum\ncharge for all grains and introduces a bandgap between the valence and\nconduction band for silicates), the reduction of the work function of graphite, an\nupgrade of the treatment of the photoelectric effect, and an altered prescription\nfor the sticking efficiency of electrons. A comprehensive discussion of the grain\ntreatment currently included in Cloudy will be presented in a forthcoming\npaper.\n\n21\n\n\fAppendix C\nCosmic Ray Heating\nCosmic rays are the primary source of heating and ionization deep in\nmolecular clouds. Cosmic rays of primary energy E0 ionize atoms and molecules,\nprimarily hydrogen and helium. The ejected secondary electrons can produce\nfurther ionization. The heating and ionization rates depend on the primary\nionization rate, electron fraction, and energy of the secondary electron.\nCalculations by Shull & van Steenberg (1985, Fig. 3) describe the number of\nsecondary ionizations per primary ionization and the heating efficiency due to\ncosmic rays. Wolfire et al. (1995) use an equation from Binette, Dopita & Tuohy\n(1985) that is based on this work, but modified to extend to lower E0. We also\nuse these results, with the primary cosmic ray energy E0=35 eV as in Wolfire et al\n(1995). The form of their equation for the heating efficiency, \u03b5 ( E , x ) , is:\n\n\u23a1 g (E)\n\u23a4\n1\n+\n\u03b5 ( E , x ) = \u03b21 ( x ) + \u23a2\n\u23a5\n\u23a3 \u03b11 ( x ) 1 \u2212 \u03b21 ( x ) \u23a6\n\n\u22121\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere E is the primary cosmic ray energy, x is the electron fraction,\nand \u03b21 ( x ) , \u03b11 ( x ) , and g ( E ) are coefficients that depend upon E and x.\nWe used Figure 3 of Shull & van Steenberg and derived a best-fit formula for\n\u03b5 ( E , x ) as a function of x.\n\n\u03b5 ( 35eV , x ) = \u22128.189 \u2212 18.394 x \u2212 6.608 x 2ln ( x ) + 8.322e x + 4.961 x\n\n(C2)\n\nwhich is valid for electron fractions of 1 > x > 10-4.\nFigure 35 compares C2 to the expression given by equation A3 of Wolfire et\nal. (1995). They agree to within 10%.\nCosmic rays effect physical conditions in ways that cannot be treated by only\nusing the UMIST database. We include multi-level atoms of H (Ferguson et al.\n1997) and He (Porter et al. 2005), including collisional radiative transfer\nprocesses. Cosmic rays excite resonance lines of both H0 and He0, and these are\ndegraded into L\u03b1 after multiple scatterings. The code computes the mean\nintensity in all lines, and this is included in the calculation of the radiation field\nin equation A5. This contributes to grain heating and to photoionization of H0\nand He0, from the metastable 2s and 2 3S levels respectively. This increases the\nelectron fraction.\n\n22\n\n\f8 References\nAannestad, P. A. & Emery, R. J. 2003, A & A, 406, 155\nAbel, N. P, Brogan, C. L, Ferland, G. J., O'Dell, C.

The area between the vertical lines represents the\ncontinuum used to define G0. The Lyman continuum depends strongly on\nspectral type, while G0 is relatively constant. This causes the size of the H II\nRegion relative to the PDR to vary, which affects the contribution of the H II\nregion to PDR emission-line diagnostics.\n\n26\n\n\fFigure 2 Continuum at three positions along a ray into a standard cloud. The\nincident and net local continuum is shown at three positions; the hydrogen\nionization front, the point where half the hydrogen is H2, and the shielded face.\nAt the hydrogen ionization front the Lyman continuum is strongly absorbed by\nhydrogen and dust and reemitted in the infrared by dust. PAH emission is\npresent at the half-H2 point, along with graphite absorption at 2175\u01fa. All\nradiation with \u03bb < 1\u03bcm is absorbed at the shielded face, the silicate feature is\nclearly seen in absorption, and a rich IR emission spectrum produced by atoms\nand molecules is observed.\n\n27\n\n\fFigure 3 The H+, H0, and H2 density structure of the standard cloud. This\nshows the classic transition from ionized to atomic and finally to molecular gas.\nFrom the illuminated face to the shielded face, nH increases by ~103 due to the\nassumption of constant gas pressure. The two vertical lines represent the\nhydrogen ionization front and the half-H2 point.\n\n28\n\n\fFigure 4 The oxygen ionization structure for our standard cloud. At the\nilluminated face, O is in the form of O2+ and O+. At the hydrogen ionization\nfront, most O is in the form of O0 due to rapid charge exchanges with H0. the\nrelative abundance of O0 decreases deep in the cloud due to the formation of CO.\n\n29\n\n\fFigure 5 The carbon ionization structure for our standard cloud. At the\nilluminated face, C is predominately in the form of C2+ and C3+, with some C+.\nNear the hydrogen ionization front carbon becomes predominately C+. Once H2\nforms, carbon makes the classic PDR transition from C+ to C0 and quickly over to\nCO.\n\n30\n\n\fFigure 6 The neon ionization structure for our standard cloud. Neon is singly\nand doubly ionized in the H II region, while it becomes atomic at the hydrogen\nionization front. Ne0 has a closed shell, and therefore is not chemically active in\nthe molecular cloud.\n\n31\n\n\fFigure 7 The silicon ionization structure for our standard cloud. Silicon is in\nthe form Si2+, Si3+, and Si4+ in the H II region As the hydrogen ionization front is\napproached, Si+ becomes the dominant stage of ionization. Si+ remains the\ndominant ionization stage through the PDR, becoming neutral at an AV of ~15.\n\n32\n\n\fFigure 8 Gas temperature for our standard cloud. The temperature is ~104 K\nin the H II region,. At the ionization front, H0 photoionization no longer heats\nthe gas, and the temperature falls to a few hundred Kelvin. The temperature\ncontinues to fall as the gas becomes more molecular, eventually reaching a\ntemperature of ~40 K at the shielded face.\n\n33\n\n\fFigure 9 Dust temperature for all species and sizes considered in our standard\ncloud. PAH temperatures are shown. We assume that the PAH abundance is\nproportional to the atomic hydrogen fraction. PAHs are the hottest grain species\nin the H II region but their abundance is negligible. Additionally, graphite is\nsomewhat hotter than the silicates in the H II region and PDR due to their optical\nproperties. Deep in the cloud, the gas and dust temperatures equilibrate, with\nthe silicate dust temperature ~5 K higher (see Figure 15).\n\n34\n\n\fFigure 10 Total heating and cooling rate in our standard cloud. We assume\nenergy balance so the two curves overlap. This plot can be compared with\nFigures 11 and 12 to determine the total heating or cooling rate for a given\nspecies.\n\n35\n\n\fFigure 11 Important heating processes in our standard cloud. In the H II\nregion, heating is dominated by photoionization of H0. In the PDR, grain and\ncarbon photoionization dominates. Eventually, carbon and dust photoionizing\nphotons are extinguished. Deep in the cloud grain collisional heating (see Figure\n15) and heating due to line collisional de-excitation are the primary heating\nagents.\n\n36\n\n\fFigure 12 Important cooling processes in our standard cloud. Cooling is\ndominated by fine structure excitation followed by radiative de-excitation. The\n[Si II] 35 \u03bcm and [C II] 158 \u03bcm line peaks as hydrogen makes the transition from\natomic to molecular. Deep in the calculation, CO is the primary coolant. Carbon\nmonoxide cooling peaks in regions where carbon forms CO, and falls off deep in\nthe cloud where all the CO is in the ground state.\n\n37\n\n\fFigure 13 Integrated emission of PDR lines in our standard cloud. For our\nchoice of nH, U, and T*, the assumption that low-ionization potential lines form in\nthe PDR is valid. In the PDR. C+, Si+, and O0 become the dominant stage of\nionization, and collisions with H0 excite their fine structure levels. CO emission\nfrom low J levels occurs at the C+/C0/CO transition. Due to the high column\ndensities of the low CO rotational levels, these lines quickly become optically\nthick\n\n38\n\n\fFigure 14 Molecular abundances in our standard cloud. The formation of H2\nacts as a catalyst for other molecules, especially CO. Once CO fully forms, other\nspecies start to form molecules. At the shielded face, all the hydrogen is tied up\nin H2, all carbon is in CO, all nitrogen is in N2, and a large amount of oxygen is in\nCO, O2, and H2O.\n\n39\n\n\fFigure 15 Local continuum and grain opacity at Av =20 in our standard cloud.\nThis plot shows why the silicate dust is hotter than the graphite deep in the\nmolecular cloud. The product of flux and opacity (integrated over frequency) is\nthe heating rate. The large silicate opacity in regions of high infrared flux keeps\nthe silicate grains ~5 K hotter than the gas or graphite deep in our calculation.\n\n40\n\n\fFigure 16 Log[nH] at the point in our calculations where the H+/Htot ratio falls\nto 1%. This is the hydrogen density at the face of the PDR. For a given U and\nnH+ (nH = nH+ at the illuminated face), For a given set of parameters the hydrogen\ndensity at the face of the PDR is roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than at\nthe H II region illuminated face. The temperature at the face of the PDR is\ntypically 102-103 K\n\n41\n\n\fFigure 17 Log[nH] at the point when 2H2/Htot reaches 0.9. Our constantpressure calculations do not produce a single density in the PDR, but a typical\nPDR density would be an average of the density determined from this plot and\nFigure 16. The density at the 2H2/Htot = 0.9 point is ~2.5 orders of magnitude\ngreater than the density at the illuminated face, and has a temperature of ~40 K.\n\n42\n\n\fFigure 18 Ratio of the [Ne II] 15.55 \u03bcm line intensity to the [Ne III] 12.8\u03bcm\nintensity. Because of the large critical densities of these two lines (>105 cm-3;\nGiveon et al 2002), this ratio is sensitive to T* and U but not nH+ for a range of H II\nregion densities. Both T* and U can be determined by combining this with\nFigures 19-21,.\n\n43\n\n\fFigure 19 Ratio of the [S IV] 10.5 \u03bcm line intensity to the [S III] 18.7 \u03bcm\nintensity. The critical density of both of these transitions exceeds 104 cm-3\n(Giveon et al. 2002), making the ratio of these lines insensitive to nH+ in our\ncalculations. The best way to determine T* and U would be to combine\ncalculations such as those in Figures 18 - 21 with observations (see Giveon et al.\n2002, Morisset 2004).\n\n44\n\n\fFigure 20 Ratio of the [N III] 57 \u03bcm intensity to the [N II] 122 \u03bcm intensity.\nThe critical densities for these transitions are less than 104 cm-3 (Malhorta et al.\n2001). This means that, for the range of nH+ considered in our calculations, this\nratio can also depend on density in addition to T* and U .\n\n45\n\n\fFigure 21 Ratio of the [N III] 57 \u03bcm intensity to the [N II] 205 \u03bcm intensity.\nThe critical densities for these transitions are less than 104 cm-3 (Malhorta et al.\n2001). This means that, for the range of nH+ considered in our calculations, this\nratio can also depend on density in addition to T* and U .\n\n46\n\n\fFigure 22 Computed H II region density diagnostic line ratios. Plotted is the\nratio of the [S III] 18.7 \u03bcm line intensity to the [S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line, the [O III] 52\n\u03bcm line intensity to the [O III] 88 \u03bcm line, and the [N II] 122 \u03bcm line intensity to\nthe [N II] 205 \u03bcm line. All line ratios are good density diagnostics in the H II\nregion for nH+ > 102 cm-3, while the N II ratio continues to be a good diagnostic\nacross the entire range of nH+ considered.\n\n47\n\n\fFigure 23 The predicted intensity of the [O I] 63 \u03bcm line (units ergs cm-2 s-1).\nThis line and the lines presented in Figures 24-26 depend on both the hydrogen\ndensity in the PDR and G0.\n\n48\n\n\fFigure 24 The predicted intensity of the [O I] 146 \u03bcm line (units of ergs cm-2 s-1).\n\n49\n\n\fFigure 25 The predicted intensity of the [C II] 158 \u03bcm line (units of ergs cm-2 s-1).\n\n50\n\n\fFigure 26 The predicted intensity of the [Si II] 35 \u03bcm line (units of ergs cm-2 s-1).\n\n51\n\n\fFigure 27 Log[G0] at the illuminated face for our calculations. G0 depends on\nand the cloud-star separation and can be posed into the product of U and nH\n(see equation 1).\n\nT*\n\n52\n\n\fFigure 28 The predicted ratio of the [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [O I] 146 \u03bcm line\nintensities. This ratio is a common diagnostic used to determine physical\nconditions in PDRs (Kaufman et al. 1999). Over the entire range of parameter\nspace, this ratio varies by only a factor of three.\n\n53\n\n\fFigure 29 The predicted ratio of the [O I] 63 \u03bcm to [C II] 158 \u03bcm line\nintensities. This is another common PDR diagnostic line ratio (Kaufman et al.\n1999). A significant amount of the 158 \u03bcm emission can come from the H II\nregion. Without taking the H II region into account (see Figures 30-33), this ratio\nwill be overpredicted, leading to errors in derived physical conditions that use\nthis ratio.\n\n54\n\n\fFigure 30 The percentage of the [O I] 63 \u03bcm line that emerges from the H II\nregion for our calculations. The ionization structure of O follows that of H, so\nsome O0 exists in regions where hydrogen is partially ionized. For low U \u221d\nG0/nH environments, the size of the atomic region is small. This leads to a larger\nfraction of the total emission emerging from the H II region.\n\n55\n\n\fFigure 31 The percentage of the [O I] 146 \u03bcm line that is produced in the H II\nregion. The logic governing the H II region contribution to [O I] 146 \u03bcm\nemission is exactly the same as [O I] 63 \u03bcm.\n\n56\n\n\fFigure 32 The percentage of the [C II] 158 \u03bcm line that is produced in the H II\nregion. C0 has an ionization potential less than 13.6 eV, which means that large\namounts of C+ can exist in ionized gas. For T* = 34,000 K, C+ and C2+ are the\ndominant stages of ionization. This leads to a large H II region contribution to\nthe 158 \u03bcm line. For higher T*, more C2+ and C3+ is found in the H II region and\nits contribution to the total amount of C II emission is less.\n\n57\n\n\fFigure 33 The percentage of the [Si II] 35 \u03bcm line that is produced in the H II\nregion. Silicon, like Carbon, has a first ionization potential < 13.6eV, which leads\nto a significant amount of the 35 \u03bcm line emission (>10%) coming from the H II\nregion over the entire range of parameter space.\n\n58\n\n\fFigure 34 The hydrogen radiative recombination rate used in UMIST (solid\nline) and in Cloudy (dotted line) versus temperature. Also shown is the best-fit\nequation to the recombination rate (Ferland et al. 1992, dashed line).\n\n59\n\n\fFigure 35 The cosmic ray heating efficiency variation with electron fraction.\nThe solid line is the heating efficiency given by equation 2 of Appendix C, while\nthe dashed line is equation A3 of Wolfire et al.
