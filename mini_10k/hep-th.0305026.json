Introduction\nSupersymmetric Quantum Mechanics, (SQM), was conceived in 1981 as the simplest field theory that would provide understanding of the supersymmetry breaking\nmechanism of higher dimensional field theories, [1]. Since then this formalism has become a new field of research and a great deal of work, both analytical and numerical,\nhas been done to get better knowledge of the exactly solvable, the partially solvable,\nthe isospectral, the periodic and the non-exactly solvable potential problems, (see\n[2] for the latest review). In particular, few of these latter have been investigated\nthrough a novel methodology based on the association of the variational method\nwith SQM formalism. The conjunction of this well known quantum mechanism with\nSQM has given a simple framework to investigate spectral problems of Hamiltonian\nsystems associated to the three dimensional Hulth\u00e9n, Morse and Screened Coulomb\npotentials,[3]-[5]. The main basis of the method consists in setting an Ansatz for the\nsuperpotential. Based on the superalgebra intrinsic of SQM we are able to evaluate\nthe wavefunction which naturally contains free parameters introduced by the Ansatz.\nHaving in hands our ideal wavefunction, the calculations to be done are the usual variational calculations in which the parameters are varied until the energy expectation\nvalue reaches its minimum.\nMore recently the application of this methodology to exploit the energy spectra\nof a confined quantum mechanical system gave encouraging results: the confined 3dimensional hydrogen atom showed results compatible with those obtained from other\napproximative methods and numerical calculation, [6].\nMotivated by these results and considering the widespread interest in quantum\nconfined systems, particularly in the studies of semiconductor heterostructures (nanostructures like quantum dots, quantum wires, quantum wells), [7]-[9], as well as in field\ntheory, [10], in this work we propose a systematic construction of the superpotential\nfor 3d confined systems, that yields, through SQM, to the trial wavefunction pursued.\nTo illustrate the construction, the technique is applied here to get the 1s and 2p\nenergy states for the confined Harmonic Oscillator and for the 1s, 2p and 3d energy\nstates of the confined Hulth\u00e9n, both in three dimensions. They are very good when\ncompared to recent results obtained from other approximative methods as well as\nexact numerical results, [11]-[15].\nIn what follows, in order to be self consistent and to set up the notation, we\npresent a brief description of SQM and its association with the variational method.\nAt this point we introduce our recipe for the superpotential in the general case. Then\nwe show the results of the application of this formalism to the confined Harmonic Oscillator and Hulth\u00e9n potential. Comparison with the corresponding results of other\napproximative and exact numerical results is presented in the tables, followed by a\ndiscussion and our conclusions.\n2. Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the Variational Method\nThe starting point is the factorization of a Hamiltonian H associated to a given\n2\n\n\fpotential V (r), in terms of bosonic operators A\u00b1 and the lowest energy eigenvalue\nE0 . In h\u0304 = c = 1 units, this is written as\nH=\u2212\n\n1 d2\n+ V (r) = A+ A\u2212 + E0 .\n2\n2 dr\n\n(1)\n\nWe recall that for the cases we are considering the potential is symmetric so that\nequation (1) is the radial equation and V (r) includes the barrier potential term. The\nbosonic operators are defined in terms of the so called superpotential W (r),\n!\n\n1\nd\nA\u00b1\n\u2213 + W (r) .\n1 = \u221a\ndr\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThus, substituting the bosonic operators into equation (1) we conclude that, as a\nconsequence of the factorization of the Hamiltonian H, the Riccati equation must be\nsatisfied,\nW 2 \u2212 W \u2032 = 2 (V (r) \u2212 E0 ) ,\n(3)\n\n. Also through the superalgebra, the eigenfunction for the lowest\nwhere W \u2032 = dW\ndr\nstate is related to the superpotential W by\n\u03a80 (r) = Nexp(\u2212\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nW (r\u0304)dr\u0304).\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nThe above scheme works perfectly well if the potential is exactly solvable. However, if the potential is non-exactly solvable, the Hamiltonian is not exactly factorizable, i.e., there is no superpotential that satisfies equation (3). On the other hand, the\nHamiltonian can be factorized in terms of an approximated superpotential giving rise\nto an effective potential. This is achieved by making an Ansatz for the superpotential,\nwhich naturally introduces free parameters in the problem, denoted by the set {\u03bc}.\nThus, through the superalgebra, the wavefunction, (equation (4)), is evaluated. It is\nthe trial wavefunction of the usual variational method, denoted by \u03a8\u03bc and depending\non {\u03bc}. Therefore, having in hands the main ingredient of the variational method,\nnamely the trial wavefunction, the energy expectation value given by\nR\n\nE\u03bc = R\n\n\u03a8\u2217\u03bc H\u03a8\u03bc dr\n| \u03a8\u03bc |2 dr\n\n(5)\n\ncan be evaluated and the parameters can be varied until it reaches its minimum value,\nE(\u03bc\u0304), which is an upper limit of the sought energy level. Indeed, the Ansatz in the\nsuperpotential drives us to an effective potential Vef f that has a similar form as the\noriginal potential, i.e.,\nVef f (r) =\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010 2\nW\u0304 \u2212 W\u0304 \u2032 + E(\u03bc\u0304)\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere W\u0304 = W (\u03bc\u0304) is the superpotential for {\u03bc = \u03bc\u0304}, the set of parameters that\nminimises (5). The above methodology was applied in the search of approximate\n3\n\n\fenergy levels of 3-dimensional systems, like the Hulth\u00e9n, Morse and Screened Coulomb\npotentials, [3]-[5].\nConcerning the confinement, it is remarkable that for the confined cases we have\ntreated so far, the confined Coulomb, [6], and the present cases of the confined Oscillator and Hulth\u00e9n potentials, the Ansatz set in the superpotential is restricted to an\nextra confining term added to the superpotential used in the non-confined case, i.e.,\nWconf ined = Wnon\u2212conf ined +\n\nconstant\nR\u2212r\n\n(7)\n\nwhere R is the radius of confinement. The advantage of this choice is that it allows\nus a previous comparative analysis between the original potential (non-confined) and\nthe effective potential, containing the infinite (confining) barrier. This is corroborated\nby the fact that in the R \u2192 \u221e limit the non-confined superpotential is recovered.\nMoreover, the trial wavefunction will naturally vanish at the barrier R = r and not\nas an input, as it is usual in the variational calculation.\n3. The Confined Harmonic Oscillator\nThe radial Hamiltonian equation for the Harmonic Oscillator potential, written\nin atomic units is given by\n1 d2\nl(l + 1) r 2\n+\n+ .\n(8)\n2 dr 2\n2r 2\n2\nAs the Harmonic Oscillator potential is symmetric, the confinement is introduced\nby an infinite potential barrier at radius r = R. Thus we make the following Ansatz\nfor the superpotential\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc2\nW (r) = \u2212 +\n+ \u03bc3 r\n(9)\nr\nR\u2212r\nwhich depends of R, the radius of confinement, and of three variational parameters,\n\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc3 . As stated in expression (7), the first and the last terms are already\nknown from the non-confined case, [2]. The second term deals with the confinement.\nThis is explicitly shown through the effective potential. From equation (6), it has the\nfollowing form\nH =\u2212\n\nVef f (r) =\n\n\u03bc\u03043\n\u03bc\u03043 2 \u03bc\u03041 (\u03bc\u03041 \u2212 1)\nr +\n\u2212\n\u03bc\u0304\n\u03bc\u0304\n\u2212\n+\n1\n3\n2\n2r 2\n2\n\u03bc\u03042 (\u03bc\u03042 \u2212 1)\n\u03bc\u03041 \u03bc\u03042\n\u03bc\u03042 \u03bc\u03043 r\n\u2212\n+\n+ E(\u03bc\u0304)\n2\n2(R \u2212 r)\nr(R \u2212 r) (R \u2212 r)\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is clearly infinite at r = R, as expected for a confining system. Notice that\nthe effective potential is evaluated for the values of the set of parameters {\u03bc\u0304} that\nminimise the energy. Our trial wavefunction for the variational method is obtained\nfrom the superalgebra through equation (4), using the superpotential given by the\nAnsatz made in equation (9). It is given by\n\u03a8\u03bc (r) = \u03a8(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 , r) \u221d r \u03bc1 (R \u2212 r)\u03bc2 e\u2212\u03bc3 r\n4\n\n2 /2\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\n\fIt depends of three free parameters, \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc3 and vanishes at r = R. We use\nthis trial wavefunction to calculate the energy expection value, given by the equation\n(5), evaluated with the Hamiltonian (8). Its minimisation with respect to the three\nparameters gives E(\u03bc\u0304), which, from now on, we call Evsqm . The results are given in\nthe tables below for different values of the confining radius R and states 1s and 2p,\ncorresponding to the values of l = 1 and 2 of the angular momentum, respectively.\nComparison is made with exact numerical, Eexact , perturbative, Epert , [11], other variational, Evar , [12], WKB, Ewkb, [13] and modified WKB results, Ecentri ,[15], through\nthe percentage errors,\n|Eexact \u2212 Evsqm |\n\u03b4vsqm =\n%\n(12)\nEexact\nand\n|Eexact \u2212 Epert |\n\u03b4pert =\n%.\n(13)\nEexact\nThe same percetage errors are applied to the other results. We must note that the\nperturbative results lost their accuracy for large values of the radius of confinement,\nfor which they are outside the convergence region. For the results of Table 1, R < 1.72\nand of the Table 2, R < 1.84.\nIt should be stressed that in the limit of no-confinement, i. e.

Discussion and conclusions\nThe study of the two 3-dimensional confined quantum systems considered here was\nmade through the mechanism based on the association of the variational method with\nSQM, using the recipe given to construct the superpotential, equation (7). For the\ntwo cases considered, namely, the Harmonic Oscillator and the Hulth\u00e9n potential, the\nAnsatz, as given by equations (9) and (16), respectively, naturally introduced free parameters in the superpotential. Thus, using the superalgebra the wave functions were\nevaluated, showing, of course, explicit dependence on these parameters, equations\n(11) and (18), respectively. They were our optimal wave functions, used to calculate\nthe energy expectation values, equation (5), as in the usual variational method. The\nparameters were varied until this expectation value reached its minimum, giving rise\nto the searched energy states.\nThe peculiar feature of the approach is that, when doing the Ansatz to the superpotential following the recipe of equation (7), we were able to evaluate the effective\npotential, equation (6), and also equations (10) and (19), which resemble the real,\nconfining potential under consideration. In both cases, the effective potential is surely\ninfinite at the border, r = R, and as a result the wave function, evaluated through\nthe superalgebra, equation (4), naturally vanishes at the border because it finds a\npotential barrier that increases until becoming impenetrable at r = R. Furthermore,\nfor increasing values of R the border effects vanish and our effective potential becomes the original non-confined potential. The results for the energies improved,\nwhen compared with the corresponding results of other approximative and exact numerical results, converging to the results of the non-confined system. On the other\nhand, for small values of R, stronger are the border effects, but even so very small\ndeviation from the exact numerical results were found.\nWe conclude that our main result is the recipe given for the superpotential when\n1\nconfinement takes place, equation (7). The inclusion of the confining term R\u2212r\nin\nthe superpotential was crucial to describe border effects. This prescription showed to\nbe appropriate to get good results for the cases considered so far and can be a first\ntrial to exploit other confined systems through this method. It is remarkable that the\napproach was applied to different systems. Contrary to the Coulomb potential, [6],\nand the Harmonic Oscillator, the Hulth\u00e9n potential is not exactly solvable in three\ndimensions. This makes our recipe good enough to work in the general case and\nreinforces the fact that the association of the superalgebra of SQM with the variational\nmethod gives a simple and useful framework to investigate confined systems in general.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] E.
