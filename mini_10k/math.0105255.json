In section 2 of the paper we review the formalism\nof Dirac brackets and some of the quantum physics associated with this formalism. The section ends with a brief description of the concept of quantum\ncomputer that we shall use in this paper. In section 3 we discuss the Jones\nand Temperley Lieb algebras and how they can be used to produce representations of the Artin Braid group. While most of these representations are\nnot unitary, we show how to construct non-trivial unitary representations of\n\n\fthe three-strand braid group by considering the structure of two projectors.\nIt turns out that two elementary projectors naturally generate a Temperley\nLieb algebra. This provides a way to make certain unitary representations\nand to motivate the construction of both the Alexander and the Jones polynomial. In regard to the Alexander polynomial, we end this section with a\nrepresentation of the Artin Braid Group, constructed using projectors, that\nis equivalent to the classical Burau representation. In section 4 we construct the bracket polynomial model for the Jones polynomial and relate its\nstructure to the representations discussed in the previous section. Section 5\nshows how to reformulate the bracket state sum in terms of discrete quantum amplitudes. This sets the stage for our proposal, explained in section\n6, for regarding knot invariants as quantum computers. This proposal needs\nunitary braiding (a special condition) and the results of the computer are\nprobabilistic. Nevertheless, I believe that this model deserves consideration.\nThe dialogue between topology and quantum computing is just beginning.\nAcknowledgement.

In this notation\n< a| and |b > are covectors and vectors respectively. < b|a > is the evaluation\nof |a > by < b|, hence it is a scalar, and in ordinary quantum mechanics it\nis a complex number. One can think of this as the amplitude for the state\nto begin in a and end in b. That is, there is a process that can mediate a\ntransition from state a to state b. Except for the fact that amplitudes are\ncomplex valued, they obey the usual laws of probability. This means that if\nthe process can be factored into a set of all possible intermediate states c1 ,\nc2 , ..., cn , then the amplitude for a \u2212\u2192 b is the sum of the amplitudes for\na \u2212\u2192 ci \u2212\u2192 b. Meanwhile, the amplitude for a \u2212\u2192 ci \u2212\u2192 b is the product of\nthe amplitudes of the two subconfigurations a \u2212\u2192 ci and ci \u2212\u2192 b. Formally\nwe have\n< b|a >= \u03a3i < b|ci >< ci |a >\nwhere the summation is over all the intermediate states i = 1, ..., n.\n2\n\n\fIn general, the amplitude for mutually disjoint processes is the sum of the\namplitudes of the individual processes. The amplitude for a configuration of\ndisjoint processes is the product of their individual amplitudes.\nDirac's division of the amplitudes into bras < b| and kets |a > is done\nmathematically by taking a vector space V (a Hilbert space, but it can be\nfinite dimensional) for the kets: |a > belongs to V. The dual space V \u2217 is the\nhome of the bras. Thus < b| belongs to V \u2217 so that < b| is a linear mapping\n< b| : V \u2212\u2192 C where C denotes the complex numbers. We restore symmetry\nto the definition by realising that an element of a vector space V can be\nregarded as a mapping from the complex numbers to V. Given |a >: C \u2212\u2192 V ,\nthe corresponding element of V is the image of 1 (in C) under this mapping.\nIn other words, |a > (1) is a member of V. Now we have |a >: C \u2212\u2192 V and\n< b| : V \u2212\u2192 C. The composition < b| \u25e6 |a >=< b|a >: C \u2212\u2192 C is regarded\nas an element of C by taking the specific value < b|a > (1). The complex\nnumbers are regarded as the vacuum, and the entire amplitude < b|a > is\na vacuum to vacuum amplitude for a process that includes the creation of\nthe state a, its transition to b, and the annihilation of b to the vacuum once\nmore.\nDirac notation has a life of its own. Let\nP = |y >< x|.\nLet\n< x||y >=< x|y > .\nThen\nP P = |y >< x||y >< x| = |y >< x|y >< x| =< x|y > P.\nUp to a scalar multiple, P is a projection operator. That is, if we let\nQ = P/ < x|y >,\nthen\nQQ = P P/ < x|y >< x|y >=< x|y > P/ < x|y >< x|y >= P/ < x|y >= Q.\nThus QQ = Q. In this language, the completeness of intermediate states\nbecomes the statement that a certain sum of projections is equal to the\n3\n\n\fidentity: Suppose that \u03a3i |ci >< ci | = 1 (summing over i) with < ci |ci >= 1\nfor each i. Then\n< b|a >=< b||a >=< b|\u03a3i |ci >< ci ||a >= \u03a3i < b||ci >< ci ||a >\n< b|a >= \u03a3i < b|ci >< ci |a >\nIterating this principle of expansion over a complete set of states leads to\nthe most primitive form of the Feynman integral [5]. Imagine that the initial\nand final states a and b are points on the vertical lines x = 0 and x = n + 1\nrespectively in the x \u2212 y plane, and that (c(k)i(k) , k) is a given point on the\nline x = k for 0 < i(k) < m. Suppose that the sum of projectors for each\nintermediate state is complete. That is, we assume that following sum is\nequal to one, for each k from 1 to n \u2212 1 :\n|c(k)1 >< c(k)1 | + ... + |c(k)m >< c(k)m | = 1.\nApplying the completeness iteratively, we obtain the following expression for\nthe amplitude < b|a >:\n< b|a >= \u03a3\u03a3\u03a3...\u03a3 < b|c(1)i(1) >< c(1)i(1) |c(2)i(2) > ... < c(n)i(n) |a >\nwhere the sum is taken over all i(k) ranging between 1 and m, and k ranging\nbetween 1 and n. Each term in this sum can be construed as a combinatorial\npath from a to b in the two dimensional space of the x \u2212 y plane. Thus the\namplitude for going from a to b is seen as a summation of contributions from\nall the paths connecting a to b.

His path integral takes the\nform\nZ\n\ndP exp(iS)\n\nwhere i is the square root of minus one, the integral is taken over all paths\nfrom point a to point b, and S is the action for a particle to travel from a to\nb along a given path. For the quantum mechanics associated with a classical\n(Newtonian) particle the action S is given by the integral along the given\npath from a to b of the difference T \u2212 V where T is the classical kinetic\nenergy and V is the classical potential energy of the particle.\n\n5\n\nC1\n\n\f2.1\n\nWhat is a Quantum Computer?\n\nWe are now in a position to explain the definition of quantum computer that\nwill be used in this paper. Let H be a given finite dimensional vector space\nover the complex numbers C. Let {W0 , W1 , ..., Wn } be an orthonormal basis\nfor H so that with |i >:= |Wi > denoting Wi and < i| denoting the conjugate\ntranspose of |i >, we have\n< i|j >= \u03b4ij\nwhere \u03b4ij denotes the Kronecker delta (equal to one when its indices are\nequal to one another, and equal to zero otherwise). Given a vector v in H\nlet |v|2 :=< v|v > . Note that < i|v is the i-th coordinate of v.\nAn observation of v returns one of the coordinates |i > of v with probability\n| < i|v|2 . This model of observation is a simple instance of the situation with\na quantum mechanical system that is in a mixed state until it is observed.\nThe result of observation is to put the system into one of the basis states.\nWhen the dimension of the space H is two (n = 1), a vector in the space\nis called a qubit. A qubit represents one quantum of binary information. On\nobservation, one obtains either the ket |0 > or the ket |1 >. This constitutes\nthe binary distinction that is inherent in a qubit. Note however that the\ninformation obtained is probabilistic. If the qubit is\n\u03c8 = \u03b1|0 > +\u03b2 |1 >,\nthen the ket |0 > is observed with probability |\u03b1|2 , and the ket |1 > is observed with probability |\u03b2|2. In speaking of an idealized quantum computer,\nwe do not specify the nature of measurement process beyond these probability postulates.\nIn the case of general dimension n of the space H, we will call the vectors\nin H qunits. It is quite common to use spaces H that are tensor products\nof two-dimensional spaces (so that all computations are expressed in terms\nof qubits) but this is not neccessary in principle. One can start with a given\nspace, and later work out factorizations into qubit transformations.\nA quantum computation consists in the application of a unitary transformation U to an initial qunit \u03c8 = a1 |1 > +... + an |n > with |\u03c8|2 = 1,\nplus an observation of U\u03c8. An observation of U\u03c8 returns the ket |i > with\n6\n\n\fprobability |U\u03c8|2 . In particular, if we start the computer in the state |i >,\nthen the probability that it will return the state |j > is | < j|U|i > |2 .\nIt is the neccessity for writing a given computation in terms of unitary\ntrasformations, and the probabilistic nature of the result that characterizes\nquantum computation. Such computation could be carried out by an idealized quantum mechanical system. It is hoped that such systems can be\nphysically realized.\n\n3\n\nBraiding, Projectors and the Temperley Lieb\nAlgebra\n\nThe Jones polynomial is one of the great mathematical breakthroughs of the\ntwentieth century, and like many such breakthroughs it appears basically\nsimple in retrospect. I will tell two stories in this section. The first story\nis a capsule summary of how Jones discovered the polynomial by way of an\napparently strange algebraic structure that first appeared in his research on\nvon Neumann algebras, and then was pointed out to be an algebra known to\nexperts in the Potts model in statistical mechanics. The second story shows\nthat the essential algebra for the needed representation of the braid group is\npresent in the algebra generated by any two simple projectors (see below for\nthe definitions of these terms) and that it is graphically illustrated by the\nDirac bra-ket notation for these operators.\nJones was studying the inclusion of one von Neuman algebra N in another\none M. In this context there is a projection e1 : M \u2212\u2192 N so that the\nrestriction of e to N is the identity mapping, and so that e21 = e1 . In his\ncontext the algebra M could be extended to include this projector to an\nS\nalgebra M1 = M {e1 }. Then we have\nN \u2282 M \u2282 M1\n\nand the construction can be continued inductively to produce\nN \u2282 M \u2282 M1 \u2282 M2 \u2282 M3 \u2282 ...\nand an algebra of projectors\ne1 , e2 , e3 , ...\n7\n\n\fsuch that\ne2i = ei , i = 1, 2, 3, ...\nei ei\u00b11 ei = \u03baei , i = 2, 3, ...\nei ej = ej ei , |i \u2212 j| > 1.\nWe will call an algebra that can be expressed with generators and relations\nas above a Jones algebra. J\u221e will denote a Jones algebra on infinitely many\ngenerators as above.

Figure 2 illustrates the generators\nof the braid group. The second and third Reidemeister moves shown in\nFigure 6 illustrate the braiding relations except for commutativity of distant\ngenerators.\nThe representation that Jones discovered is a linear one in the form of\n\u03c1 : B\u221e \u2212\u2192 J\u221e\nwhere\n\u03c1(\u03c3i ) = \u03b11 + \u03b2ei\nfor appropriate constants \u03b1 and \u03b2. We will elaborate on this representation\nshortly. Here J\u221e denotes the algebra generated by the ei for i = 1, 2, 3, ....\n9\n\n\fIt seems an amazing coincidence that a representation algebra for the Artin\nBraid group would appear in a context that seems so far away from this\nstructure. The complex source of Jones' algebra makes this connection seem\nquite mysterious, and the fact that this same algebra appears in statistical\nmechanics also seems mysterious. What is the source of this apparent connection of the Artin Braid group with algebras and structures coming from\nquauntum physics?\nRemark. In the discussion to follow, we will use the bra and ket notations\nof Dirac and we will write < v| for v t , using the notation v t for the transpose\nof a vector v. It is to be understood that in the case of a complex vector\nspace, this is the conjugate transpose, but that in the generalizations that we\nuse (over more general rings) we will simply take the formal transpose without conjugation. Later we will construct real-valued representations of the\nTemperley-Lieb algebra, and there transpose will be the same as conjugate\ntranspose.\nFor the purpose of this discussion it will be useful to define a projector to\nbe a linear map P : V \u2212\u2192 V where V is a vector space or a module over a\nring k, and P 2 is a non-zero multiple of P . Shall call a projector simple if,\nin a basis, it takes the form P = vv t where v is a column vector and v t is its\ntranspose. Then v t v is the dot product of v with itself and hence a scalar.\nTherefore\nP 2 = P P = vv t vv t = v[v t v]v t\n= [v t v]vv t = [v t v]P.\nBecause of the ubiquity of projectors in quantum physics, the physicist\nP.A.M. Dirac devised a beautiful notation for this situation. Dirac would\nwrite |v > for v and < v| for v t . He would write\n< v||w >=< v|w >= v t w\n\nfor the dot product of two vectors in a given basis.\nThen one can write P in Dirac notation by the formula\nP = |v >< v|\nand we have\nP 2 = P P = |v >< v||v >< v| = |v >< v|v >< v|\n10\n\n\f=< v|v > |v >< v| =< v|v > P.\nNow consider the algebra generated by two simple projectors P = |v >< v|\nand Q = |w >< w|. We have\nP 2 =< v|v > P,\nQ2 =< w|w > Q\nand\nP QP = |v >< v||w >< w||v >< v|\n= |v >< v|w >< w|v >< v|\n=< v|w >< w|v > |v >< v|\n=< v|w >< w|v > P\nwhile\nQP Q = |w >< w||v >< v||w >< w|\n= |w >< w|v >< v|w >< w|\n=< w|v >< v|w > |w >< w|\n=< w|v >< v|w > Q\n=< v|w >< w|v > Q.\nThus, with \u03bb =< v|w >< w|v > we have that\nP QP = \u03bbP\nQP Q = \u03bb Q.\nWe can define e = P/ < v|v > and f = Q/ < w|w > and find\ne2 = e\nf2 = f\nef e = \u03bae\nf ef = \u03baf\nwhere \u03ba = \u03bb/(< v|v >< w|w >). In this way we see that any two simple\nprojectors generate a Jones algebra of type J2 . In this sense the appearance\n11\n\n\fof such algebras is quite natural. The relationship with braiding remains as\nremarkable as ever.\nIn order to see how these representations work, it is useful to discuss\nthe combinatorics of these algebras a bit further. The Temperley Lieb algebra T Ln [11] is an algebra over a commutative ring k with generators\n{1, U1 , U2 , ..., Un\u22121 } and relations\nUi2 = \u03b4Ui ,\nUi Ui\u00b11 Ui = Ui ,\nUi Uj = Uj Ui , |i \u2212 j| > 1,\nwhere \u03b4 is a chosen element of the ring k. These equations give the multiplicative structure of the algebra. The algebra is a free module over the\nring k with basis the equivalence classes of these products modulo the given\nrelations.\nWe will make the ground ring specific in the examples to follow. It is\nclear that the concepts of Temperley Lieb algebra and Jones algebra \u221a\nare\ninterchangeable. Given a Jones algebra J\u221e , with ei ei\u00b11 ei = \u03baei , let \u03b4 = 1/ \u03ba\n(assuming that this square root exists in the ground ring k. Then let Ui = \u03b4ei\nand we find that Ui2 = \u03b4Ui with\n\u221a\nUi Ui\u00b11 Ui = (1/ \u03ba)3 ei ei\u00b11 ei\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= (1/ \u03ba)3 \u03baei = (1/ \u03ba)ei = Ui ,\nconverting the Jones algebra to a Temperley Lieb algebra.\nIt is useful to see the bare bones of the algebra of two projectors. For\nthis purpose, lets write\nP =><\nand\nQ =][.\nThen\nP P =>< ><=<> ><=<> P\n12\n\n\fand\nQQ =][ ][= []Q\nwhile\nP QP =>< ][ ><=<] [> P\nQP Q =][ >< ][= [> <]Q =<] [> Q.\nTo see how the representation of the braid group is constructed, lets assume\nthat the scalars <] and [> are both equal to 1 and that \u03b4 =<>= []. Then P\nand Q form a two-generator Temperley Lieb algebra T L3 . We will illustrate\nhow to represent the three strand Artin braid group B3 to T L2 .\nIt is useful to use the iconic symbol >< for a projector and to choose\nanother iconic symbol \u224d for the identity operator in the algebra. With these\nchoices we have\n\u224d\u224d = \u224d\n\n\u224d >< = >< \u224d = ><\n\u224d][ = ][\u224d = ][\n\nWe define the representation \u03c1 : B3 \u2212\u2192 T L3 on the generators \u03c31 = \u03c3 and\n\u03c32 = \u03c4 of the three strand braid group, whose relations are \u03c3\u03c4 \u03c3 = \u03c4 \u03c3\u03c4 plus\nthe invertibility of the generators. We define\n\u03c1(\u03c3) = A1 + BP = A\u224d + B ><\nand\n\n\u03c1(\u03c3 \u22121 ) = B1 + AP = B \u224d + A ><\n\u03c1(\u03c4 ) = A1 + BQ = A\u224d + B][\n\n\u03c1(\u03c4 \u22121 ) = B1 + AQ = B \u224d + A][.\n\nwhere A and B are commuting indeterminates.\nWith these definitions, we have\n\n\u03c1(\u03c3) = A\u224d + B ><\n\u03c1(\u03c3 \u22121 ) = B \u224d + A >< .\n13\n\n\fThus\n\n\u224d = (A\u224d + B ><)(B \u224d + A ><)\n= AB \u224d\u224d + A2 \u224d >< +B 2 >< \u224d + AB ><><\n= AB \u224d + A2 >< +B 2 >< +AB\u03b4 ><\n\u224d = AB \u224d + (A2 + B 2 + AB\u03b4) ><\n\nConsequently, we will have 1 = \u03c1(\u03c3)\u03c1(\u03c3 \u22121 ) if we take B = A\u22121 and \u03b4 =\n\u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 . We shall take these values from now on so that\n\u03c1(\u03c3) = A\u224d + A\u22121 ><= A1 + A\u22121 P\nand\n\u03c1(\u03c4 ) = A\u224d + A\u22121 ][= A1 + A\u22121 Q.\nWith these specializations of A and B, it is easy to verify that \u03c1 is a\nrepresentation of the Artin Braid Group. Note that P 2 = \u03b4P , Q2 = \u03b4Q and\nP QP = P.\n\u03c1(\u03c3)\u03c1(\u03c4 )\u03c1(\u03c3) = (A + A\u22121 P )(A + A\u22121 Q)(A + A\u22121 P )\n= (A2 + Q + P + A\u22122 P Q)(A + A\u22121 P )\n= A3 + AQ + AP + A\u22121 P Q + AP + A\u22121 QP + A\u22121 P 2 + A\u22123 P QP\n= A3 + AQ + AP + A\u22121 P Q + AP + A\u22121 QP + A\u22121 \u03b4P + A\u22123 P\n= A3 + (2A + +A\u22121 (\u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 ) + A\u22123 )P + AQ + A\u22121 (P Q + QP )\n= A3 + AP + AQ + A\u22121 (P Q + QP )\n\n\u03c1(\u03c3)\u03c1(\u03c4 )\u03c1(\u03c3) = A3 + A(P + Q) + A\u22121 (P Q + QP )\nSince this last expression is symmetric in P and Q, we conclude that\n\u03c1(\u03c3)\u03c1(\u03c4 )\u03c1(\u03c3) = \u03c1(\u03c4 )\u03c1(\u03c3)\u03c1(\u03c4 ).\nHence \u03c1 is a representation of the Artin Braid Group.\nThis argument generalizes to yield a corresponding representation of the\nArtin Braid Group Bn to the Temperley Lieb algebra T Ln for each n =\n14\n\n\f2, 3, .... We will discuss the structure of these representations below. In the\nnext section we show how the Jones polynomial can be constructed by a state\nsummation model. This model can be also be viewed as a generalisation of\nthe above representation of the Temperley Lieb algebra.\nThe very close relationship between elementary quantum mechanics and\ntopology is very well illustrated by the structure and representations of the\nTemperley Lieb algebra.\n\n15\n\n\fU1\n\nU2\n\n1\n\nU12 = \u03b4U1\n\nU1 U2 U1 = U1\n\nFigure 3 - Diagrammatic Temperley Lieb Algebra\nFigure 3 illustrates a diagrammatic interpretation of the Temperley Lieb\n16\n\n\falgebra. In this interpretation, the multiplicative generators of the module\nare collections of strands connecting n top points and n bottom points. Top\npoints can be connected either to top or to bottom points. Bottom points\ncan be connected to either bottom or to top points. All connections are made\nin the plane with no overlapping lines and no lines going above the top row\nof points or below the bottom row of points. Multiplication is accomplished\nby connecting the bottom row of one configuration with the top row of another. In Figure 3 we have illustrated the types of special configurations that\ncorrespond to the Ui , and we have shown that \u03b4 is interpreted as a closed\nloop.\n@\n@\n@@\n\n\u03c31\n\n1\n\nU1\n\n\u03c1(\u03c31 ) = AU1 + A\u22121 1\n\nFigure 4 - Braid Group Representation\n\n17\n\n\fx\n\nb\na\n\u03b4ab\nc\n\nxa\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nMab\nb\nd\nM cd\n\na\na\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nb\nx\n\ni\n\nM ab Mab\nx\n\nb\n\nM ai Mib = \u03b4ba\n\nFigure 5 - Abstract Tensors\nOne way to make a matrix representation of the Temperley Lieb algebra\n(and a corresponding representation of the braid group) is to use the matrix\nM defined as follows\nM=\n\n\"\n\n0\niA\n\u22121\n\u2212iA\n0\n18\n\n#\n\n.\n\n\fNote that M 2 = 1 where 1 denotes the (2\u00d72) identity matrix. We will use M\nwith either upper or lower indices so that M ab = Mab . M will represent both\nthe cup and the cap in the Temperley Lieb diagrams, with Mab representing\nthe cap and M ab representing the cup. If U denotes a cup over a cap, then\nab\nUcd\n= M ab Mcd .\n\nNote that\nab ij\n(U 2 )ab\ncd = \u03a3ij Uij Ucd =\n\n= \u03a3ij M ab Mij M ij Mcd = [\u03a3ij Mij M ij ]M ab Mcd\nab\n= [\u03a3ij Mij M ij ]Ucd\n.\n\nNote that\n\u03a3ij Mij M ij = \u03a3ij (Mij )2 = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 .\n\nThus, letting \u03b4 = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 , we have\n\nU 2 = \u03b4U.\nThen we take Ui as a tensor product of identity matrices corresponding to\nthe vertical lines in the diagram for this element and one factor of U for the\nplacement of the cup-cap at the locations i and i + 1. To see how this works\nto give the relation Ui Ui\u00b11 Ui = Ui , we verify that U1 U2 U1 = U1 in T L3 .\nIn the calculation to follow we will use the Einstein summation convention.\nRepeated upper and lower indices are summed across the index set {1, 2}.\nU1 = U \u2297 1\nand\nU2 = 1 \u2297 U\nso that\nab\nc\n(U1 )abc\ndef = M Mde \u03b4f\n\n19\n\n\fand\na\nbc\n(U2 )abc\ndef = \u03b4d M Mef .\n\nTherefore\nijk\nabc\nrst\n(U1 U2 U1 )abc\ndef = (U1 )ijk (U2 )rst (U1 )def\n\n= (M ab Mij \u03b4kc )(\u03b4ri M jk Mst )(M rs Mde \u03b4ft )\n= M ab (Mrj M jc )(Msf M rs )Mde = M ab (\u03b4rc )(\u03b4fr )Mde =\n= M ab Mde \u03b4fc = (U1 )abc\ndef\nThus\nU1 U2 U1 = U1 .\nThis representation of the Temperley Lieb algebra is useful for knot theory\nand it is conjectured to be a faithful representation. One may also conjecture\nthat the corresponding braid group representation is faithful.\nRemark. The reader should note that the diagrammatic interpretation of\nthe Temperley Lieb algebra gives a clear way to follow the index details of the\ncalculation we have just performed. In the diagrams an index that is not on\na free end is summed over just as in the Einstein summation convention. An\nindex at the end of a line is a free index and does not receive summation. See\nFigure 5 for an illustration of the index algebra in relation to these diagrams.\nWe will generalize the diagrammatic algebra in section 5.\n\n3.1\n\nTwo Projectors and a Unitary Representation of\nthe Three Strand Braid Group\n\nThe Temperley Lieb representation of the braid group that we have described\nis not a unitary representation except when A2 = \u22121, a value that is not of\ninterest in the knot theory. In order to find elementary unitary representations of the braid group, one has to go deeper.\n\n20\n\n\fIt is useful to think of the Temperley Lieb algebra as generated by projections ei = Ui /\u03b4 so that e2i = ei and ei ei\u00b11 ei = \u03c4 ei where \u03c4 = \u03b4 \u22122 and ei\nand ej commute for |i \u2212 j| > 1.\nWith this in mind, consider elementary projectors e = |A >< A| and\nf = |B >< B|. We assume that < A|A >=< B|B >= 1 so that e2 = e and\nf 2 = f. Now note that\nef e = |A >< A|B >< B|A >< A| =< A|B >< B|A > e = \u03c4 e\nThus\nef e = \u03c4 e\nwhere \u03c4 =< A|B >< B|A >.\nThis algebra of two projectors is the simplest instance of a representation\nof the Temperley Lieb algebra. In particular, this means that a representation\nof the three-strand braid group is naturally associated with the algebra of\ntwo projectors, a simple toy model of quantum physics!\nQuite specifically if we let < A| = (a, b) and |A >= (a, b)t the transpose\nof this row vector, then\ne = |A >< A| =\n\n\"\n\na2 ab\nab b2\n\n#\n\nis a standard projector matrix when a2 + b2 = 1. To obtain a specific representation, let\ne1 =\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n#\n\na2 ab\nab b2\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nand\ne2 =\n\n\"\n\nIt is easy to check that\ne1 e2 e1 = a2 e1\nand that\n21\n\n.\n\n\fe2 e1 e2 = a2 e2 .\nNote also that\ne1 e2 =\n\n\"\n\na2 ab\n0 0\n\ne2 e1 =\n\n\"\n\na2 0\nab 0\n\n#\n\nand\n#\n\n.\n\nWe define\nUi = \u03b4ei\nfor i = 1, 2 with a2 = \u03b4 \u22122 . Then we have , for i = 1, 2\nUi2 = \u03b4Ui\nU1 U2 U1 = U1\nU2 U1 U2 = U2\nand\ntrace(U1 ) = trace(U2 ) = \u03b4\nwhile\ntrace(U1 U2 ) = trace(U2 U1 ) = 1.\nWe will use these results on the traces of these matrices in Section 6.\nNow we return to the matrix parameters: Since a2 + b2 = 1 this means\nthat \u03b4 \u22122 + b2 = 1 whence\nb2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u22122 .\n\nTherefore b is real when \u03b4 2 is greater than or equal to 1.\n\n22\n\n\fWe are interested in the case where \u03b4 = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 and A is a unit\ncomplex number. Under these circumstances the braid group representation\n\u03c1(\u03c3i ) = AUi + A\u22121 1\nwill be unitary whenever Ui is a real symmetric matrix. Thus we will obtain\na unitary representation of the three-strand braid group B3 when \u03b4 2 \u2265 1.\nSpecifically, let A = ei\u03b8 . Then \u03b4 = \u22122cos(2\u03b8), so the condition \u03b4 2 \u2265 1\nis equivalent to cos2 (2\u03b8) \u2265 1/4. Thus we get the specific range of angles\n|\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c0/6 and |\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0| \u2264 \u03c0/6 that gives unitary representations of the threestrand braid group.\n\n3.2\n\nPairs of Projectors and the Alexander Polynomial\n\nJust for the record we note a more general braid group representation that\nis available via our remarks about the structure of two projectors. Let\n{W1 , W2 , ..., Wn\u22121, Wn } be the standard basis of column vectors for a module\nof dimension n over k = C[A, A\u22121 ] where C denotes the complex numbers\nand Wk is an n-tuple whose entries are zero in all places except the k-th\nplace where the entry is one. We shall refer to linear combinations of the Wk\nas vectors over k. Given any vector v over k, let |v > denote v as a column\nvector, and let < v| = v t denote its transpose (just the transpose, as in our\nprevious remarks), the corresponding row vector. Then P (v) = |v >< v| is\na matrix such that P 2 =< v|v > P , and < v|v >= v t v is equal to the sum\nof the squares of the entries of v.\nFor k = 1, 2, ..., n \u2212 1 and i2 = \u22121, let\nvk = iAWk \u2212 iA\u22121 Wk+1\nand\n\nThen, with \u03b4 = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 ,\n\nUk = |vk >< vk |.\nUk2 = \u03b4Uk\nUk Uk\u00b11 Uk = Uk\n23\n\n\fUk Ul = Ul Uk = 0, |k \u2212 l| > 1.\n\nThus these matrices give a special representation of the Temperley Lieb algebras T Ln for each n. Since the loop value is as given above, we can make\ncorrepsonding representations of the Artin Braid Groups Bn by the formulas\n\u03c1(\u03c3k ) = AIn + A\u22121 Uk ,\n\u03c1(\u03c3k\u22121 ) = A\u22121 In + AUk\nwhere In denotes the n \u00d7 n identity matrix. It is not hard to verify that\nthis representation of Bn is equivalent to the classical Burau representation\n(See [15]) of the braid group. This shows that there is a pathway from the\nalgebra of projectors to the Alexander polynomial! We will treat this theme\nin a separate paper.\n\n4\n\nThe Bracket Polynomial\n\nIn this section we shall discuss the structure of the the bracket state model\nfor the Jones polynomial [11]. In this way, we will explicitly construct the\nJones polynomial by using a state summation that is closely related to the\nbraid group representation described in the last section.\nBefore discussing the bracket polynomial we recall the basic theorem\nof Reidemeister [23] about knot and link diagrams. Reidemeister proved\nthat the the three local moves on diagrams illustrated in Figure 6 capture\ncombinatorially the notion of ambient isotopy of links and knots in threedimensional space. That is, if two diagrams represent knots or links that are\nisotopic in three-dimensional space, then the one diagram can be obtained\nfrom the other by a seqence of Reidemeister moves. It is understood that a\nReidemeister move is a local change on the diagram and that it is locally just\nas indicated by the picture of the move. That is, a type one move adds or\neliminates a loop in the underlying 4-regular graph of the knot diagram. A\ntype two move operates on a two sided region and a type three move operates\non a three sided region. It is also understood that one can simplify a diagram\nby a homeomorphism of the plane. This could be called the type zero move,\nbut it is always available. The equivalence relation generated by the type\ntwo and type three moves is called regular isotopy.

This is illustrated in Figure 8. In this Figure we show the\ntwo equivalent configurations in the third Reidemeister move vertically on\nthe left, with arrows point to the right of each configuration to an expansion\nvia the bracket at one crossing. The expansions give the same bracket calculation due to invariance under the second Reidemeister move. Since the\nbracket is invariant under the second and third Reidemeister moves, property\n1. is a direct consequence of properties 2. and 3.. The second two properties\ndefine the bracket on arbitrary link diagrams.\n29\n\n\fIn fact we could have begun with the following more general definition:\nLet K be any unoriented link diaram. Define a state of K to be a choice of\nsmoothings for all the crossings of K. There are 2N states of a diagram with\nN crossings. A smoothing of a crossing is a local repacement of that crossing\nwith two arcs that do not cross one another, as shown below. There are two\nchoices for smoothing a given crossing. In illustrating a state it is convenient\nto label the smoothing with A or B to indicate the crossing from which it\nwas smoothed. The A or B is called a vertex weight of the state.\nLabel each state with vertex weights A or B as illustrated in Figure 9.\nHere A and B are commuting polynomial variables. Define two evaluations\nrelated to the state: The first evaluation is the product of the vertex weights,\ndenoted\n[K|S].\nThe second evaluation is the number of loops (Jordan curves) in the state S,\ndenoted\n||S||.\nDefine the state summation, [K], by the formula\n[K] =\n\nX\n\n[K|S]\u03b4 ||S||\u22121.\n\nS\n\nIt follows from this definition,that [K] satisfies the formulas\n[\u03c7] = A[\u224d] + B[><]\n[O K] = \u03b4[K],\n\nand\n[O] = 1.\nThe demand that [K] be invariant under the second Reidemeister move\nleads to the conditions B = A\u22121 and \u03b4 = \u2212A2 + A\u22122 . This specialization is\neasily seen to be invariant under the third Reidemeister move. Calling this\nspecialization the topological bracket, and denoting it (as above) by < K >\none finds the following behaviour under the first Reidemeister move\n< \u03b3 >= \u2212A3 <\u2323>\n30\n\n\fand\n< \u03b3 >= \u2212A\u22123 <\u2323>\n\nwhere \u03b3 denotes a curl of positive type as indicated in Figure 10, and \u03b3\nindicates a curl of negative type as also seen in this Figure.\nThe topological bracket is invariant under regular isotopy and can be\nnormalized to an invariant of ambient isotopy by the definition\nfK (A) = (\u2212A3 )\u2212w(K) < K > (A)\nwhere w(K) is the sum of the crossing signs of the oriented link K. w(K) is\ncalled the writhe of K.

One of the neatest applications\nis to simply compute fK (A) for the trefoil knot T and determine that fK (A)\nis not equal to fK (A\u22121 ). This shows that the trefoil is not ambient isotopic\nto its mirror image (See Figure 11), a fact that is quite tricky to prove by\nclassical methods.\nRemark. The relationship of the Temperley Lieb algebra with the bracket\npolynomial comes through the basic bracket identity. This identity, interpreted in the context of the diagrammtic Temperley Lieb algebra becomes a\nrepresentation \u03c1 of the Artin braid group Bn on n strands to the Temperley\nLieb algebra T Ln defined by the formulas\n\u03c1(\u03c3i ) = AUi + A\u22121 1\n\u03c1(\u03c3i\u22121 ) = A\u22121 Ui + A1.\nHere sigmai denotes the braid generator that twists strands i and i + 1.\nFor this representation of the Temperley Lieb algebra, the loop value \u03b4 is\n\u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 and the ring k is Z[A, A\u22121 ], the ring of Laurent polynomials in\nA with integer coefficients.\nRemark. There are hints of quantum mechanical interpretations in the combinatorics of this state sum model for the Jones polynomial. The expansion\nformula for the bracket polynomial\n32\n\n\f< K >= A < SA K > +A\u22121 < SB K >\nsuggests that the diagram K should be thought of as a superposition of the\ndiagrams SA K and SB K. That is, we can think of a knot diagram with\nrespect to a given crossing as the superposition of the diagrams obtained by\nsmoothing that crossing. Then, with respect to all the crossings, one can\nthink of the diagram as a superposition of the states obtained by smoothing\neach crossing in one of its two possible ways. This is a superposition view of\nthe bracket state sum as a whole.\n< K >=\n\nX\n\n< K|S > \u03b4 ||S||\u22121\n\nS\n\nIn this sense the bracket polynomial evaluation is directly analogous to an\namplitude in quantum mechanics. We shall make this analogy more precise\nin the sections to follow. However, the topological information is contained\nin this amplitude as whole, and not in any specific state evaluation. Thus the\ntopological model ignores the standard measurement situation in quantum\nmechanics where one gets at best information about one state at a time when\na measurement is taken. This means that a quantum computational model\nof the bracket polynomial will be essentially probabilistic, only giving partial\ninformation at each measurement.\nAs a result of this discussion, it is natural to ask to what extent one can\nextract partial topological information from an incomplete summation over\nthe states of the bracket polynomial. It is not clear at this stage what this\nanswer is to this question. It may require a new exploration of the properties\nof the state sum and its corresponding polynomial.\n\n5\n\nKnot Amplitudes\n\nAt the end of the first section we said: the connection of quantum mechanics\nwith topology is an amplification of Dirac notation. In this section we begin\nthe process of amplification!\n\n33\n\n\ft\n\n6\n\n#\n\n\"!\n-\n\nx\n\nFigure 12 - Circle in Spacetime\nConsider first a circle in a spacetime plane with time represented vertically and space horizontally. The circle represents a vacuum to vacuum\nprocess that includes the creation of two \"particles\", and their subsequent\nannihilation. See Figures 12 and 13.\n\n6 '\n\n$\n\n&\n\n%\n\nFigure 13 - Creation and Annihilation\n\nIn accord with our previous description, we could divide the circle into\nthese two parts (creation(a) and annihilation (b)) and consider the amplitude\n< b|a > . Since the diagram for the creation of the two particles ends in two\nseparate points, it is natural to take a vector space of the form V \u2297 V as the\ntarget for the bra and as the domain of the ket.\nWe imagine at least one particle property being catalogued by each dimension of V. For example, a basis of V could enumerate the spins of the\n34\n\n\fcreated particles. If {ea } is a basis for V then {ea \u2297 eb } forms a basis for\nV \u2297 V. The elements of this new basis constitute all possible combinations\nof the particle properties. Since such combinations are multiplicative, the\ntensor product is the appropriate construction.\nIn this language the creation ket is a map cup,\ncup = |a >: C \u2212\u2192 V \u2297 V,\nand the annihilation bra is a mapping cap,\ncap =< b| : V \u2297 V \u2212\u2192 C.\nThe first hint of topology comes when we realise that it is possible to draw\na much more complicated simple closed curve in the plane that is nevertheless\ndecomposed with respect to the vertical direction into many cups and caps.\nIn fact, any simple (no self-intersections) differentiable curve can be rigidly\nrotated until it is in general position with respect to the vertical. It will then\nbe seen to be decomposed into these minima and maxima. Our prescriptions\nfor amplitudes suggest that we regard any such curve as an amplitude via its\ndescription as a mapping from C to C.\nEach simple closed curve gives rise to an amplitude, but any simple closed\ncurve in the plane is isotopic to a circle, by the Jordan Curve Theorem. If\nthese are topological amplitudes, then they should all be equal to the original\namplitude for the circle. Thus the question: What condition on creation and\nannihilation will insure topological amplitudes? The answer derives from\nthe fact that all isotopies of the simple closed curves are generated by the\ncancellation of adjacent maxima and minima as illustrated below.\n\n35\n\n\f' $\n\n\u001b\n\n-\n\n& %\n\nFigure 14 - Cancellation of Maxima and Minima\nIn composing mappings it is necessary to use the identifications (V \u2297V )\u2297\nV = V \u2297 (V \u2297 V ) and V \u2297 k = k \u2297 V = V. Thus in the illustration above,\nthe composition on the left is given by\nV = V \u2297 k \u2212 1 \u2297 cup \u2192 V \u2297 (V \u2297 V )\n= (V \u2297 V ) \u2297 V \u2212 cap \u2297 1 \u2192 k \u2297 V = V.\nThis composition must equal the identity map on V (denoted 1 here) for\nthe amplitudes to have a proper image of the topological cancellation. This\ncondition is said very simply by taking a matrix representation for the corresponding operators.\nSpecifically, let {e1 , e2 , ..., en } be a basis for V. Let eab = ea \u2297 eb denote\nthe elements of the tensor basis for V \u2297 V. Then there are matrices Mab and\nM ab such that\ncup(1) = \u03a3M ab eab\nwith the summation taken over all values of a and b from 1 to n. Similarly,\ncap is described by\ncap(eab ) = Mab.\n36\n\n\fThus the amplitude for the circle is\ncap[cup(1)] = cap\u03a3M ab eab = \u03a3M ab Mab.\nIn general, the value of the amplitude on a simple closed curve is obtained\nby translating it into an \"abstract tensor expression\" in the Mab and M ab ,\nand then summing over these products for all cases of repeated indices.\n\np\n\nReturning to the topological conditions we see that they are just that\nthe matrices (Mab ) and (M ab ) are inverses in the sense that \u03a3Mai M ib = \u03b4ab\nand \u03a3M ai Mib = \u03b4ba where \u03b4ab denotes the (identity matrix) Kronecker delta\nthat is equal to one when its two indices are equal to one another and zero\notherwise.\nx\n' $\nx\n\ni\n\nb\n\n\u001b\n\nx\n\nb\n\nx\n\na\n\n-\n\n& %\nx\n\na\n\nFigure 15 - Algebraic Cancellation of Maxima and Minima\nIn Figure 15, we show the diagrammatic representative of the equation\n\u03a3Mai M ib = \u03b4ab .\nIn the simplest case cup and cap are represented by 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. The\ntopological condition implies that these matrices are inverses of each other.\nThus the problem of the existence of topological amplitudes is very easily\nsolved for simple closed curves in the plane.\n37\n\n\fNow we go to knots and links. Any knot or link can be represented by\na picture that is configured with respect to a vertical direction in the plane.\nThe picture will decompose into minima (creations) maxima (annihilations)\nand crossings of the two types shown below. (Here I consider knots and\nlinks that are unoriented. They do not have an intrinsic preferred direction\nof travel.) See Figure 16. In Figure 16 we have indicated the crossings as\nmappings of V \u2297 V to itself , called R and R\u22121 respectively. These mappings\nrepresent the transitions corresponding to these elementary configurations.\nt\n\n6\nz\n\nz\n\n@\n@\n@ z\n@\n@\n@\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n@\n@\n@\nz @\n\n@z\nz @\n\nz\n-\n\nz\n@\n@\n\nz\n\nz\n\n@\n@z\n\nz\n@\n@\n\nz\n\nz\n\n@\n@z\n\nR\n\nR\u22121\n\nx\n\nFigure 16 - Morse Knot Decomposition\nThat R and R\u22121 really must be inverses follows from the isotopy shown\nin Figure 17 (This is the second Reidemeister move.)\n\n38\n\n\fa\n\ni\n\nb\n\nz\nz\n@\n@\n@\nz @z\n@\n@\nz\n\nc\n\na\n\nj\n\n\u001b\n\nb\n\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\n-\n\n@\n@z\n\nc\n\nd\n\nd\n\nFigure 17 - Braiding Cancellation\nWe now have the vocabulary of cup,cap, R and R\u22121 . Any knot or link can\nbe written as a composition of these fragments, and consequently a choice\nof such mappings determines an amplitude for knots and links. In order for\nsuch an amplitude to be topological we want it to be invariant under the\nlist of local moves on the diagrams shown in Figure 18. These moves are an\naugmented list of the Reidemeister moves, adjusted to take care of the fact\nthat the diagrams are arranged with respect to a given direction in the plane.\nThe equivalence relation generated by these moves is called regular isotopy.\nIt is one move short of the relation known as ambient isotopy. The missing\nmove is the first Reidemeister move shown in Figure 6.\nIn the first Reidemeister move, a curl in the diagram is created or destroyed. Ambient isotopy (generated by all the Reidemeister moves) corresponds to the full topology of knots and links embedded in three dimensional\nspace. Two link diagrams are ambient isotopic via the Reidemeister moves\nif and only if there is a continuous family of embeddings in three dimensions leading from one link to the other. The moves give us a combinatorial\nreformulation of the spatial topology of knots and links.\n\n39\n\n\f0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u001b\n\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\n\u0014\n@\n@\u0014\n\u0014@\n\u0014 @\n\n\u001b\n\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\u001b\n\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\nS \u0001\u0001\nS\n\u0014 SS\n\u0014\n\n-\n\n@\n@\n@\n@\n\n4\n@\n@\n\n\u001b\n\n-\n\n@\n@\n\nFigure 18- Moves for Regular Isotopy of Morse Diagrams\nBy ignoring the first Reidemeister move, we allow the possibility that\nthese diagrams can model framed links, that is links with a normal vector\nfield or,equivalently, embeddings of curves that are thickened into bands. It\nturns out to be fruitful to study invariants of regular isotopy. In fact, one\ncan usually normalise an invariant of regular isotopy to obtain an invariant\nof ambient isotopy. We shall see an example of this phenomenon with the\nbracket polynomial in a few paragraphs.\n40\n\n\fAs the reader can see, we have already discussed the algebraic meaning\nof moves 0. and 2. The other moves translate into very interesting algebra.\nMove 3., when translated into algebra, is the famous Yang-Baxter equation.\nThe Yang-Baxter equation occurred for the first time in problems related\nto exactly solved models in statistical mechanics (See [19].). All the moves\ntaken together are directly related to the axioms for a quasi-triangular Hopf\nalgebra (aka quantum group). We shall not go into this connection here.\nThere is an intimate connection between knot invariants and the structure\nof generalised amplitudes, as we have described them in terms of vector space\nmappings associated with link diagrams. This strategy for the construction\nof invariants is directly motivated by the concept of an amplitude in quantum\nmechanics. It turns out that the invariants that can actually be produced\nby this means (that is by assigning finite dimensional matrices to the caps,\ncups and crossings) are incredibly rich. They encompass, at present, all\nof the known invariants of polynomial type (Alexander polynomial, Jones\npolynomial and their generalisations.).\nIt is now possible to indicate the construction of the Jones polynomial\nvia the bracket polynomial as an amplitude, by specifying its matrices. The\ncups and the caps are defined by (Mab ) = (M ab ) = M where M is the 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix (with ii = \u22121).\nM=\n\n\"\n\n0\niA\n\u22121\n\u2212iA\n0\n\n#\n\nNote that MM = I where I is the identity matrix.

This algorithm is the bracket state model for\nthe (unnormalised) Jones polynomial [11]. We have discussed this model in\nthe previous sections.\nThe upshot of these remarks is that the bracket state summation can\nbe reformulated as a matrix model as described in this section. Thus the\n42\n\n\fvalues of the bracket polynomial can be regarded as generalized quantum\namplitudes. Note also that the model that we have described in this section\ncan be seen as a generalization of the representation of the Temperley Lieb\nalgebra from Section 3 with basic matrix M as above. In fact, in the case\nwhere the knot or link is a closure of a braid, we can say even more. Suppose\nthat K = b where b is an n-strand braid in Bn . Then the cups and caps can\nbe paired off as hown in Figure 19 so that\nZ(K) = \u03b4 < K >= T race(\u03b7 \u2297n \u03c1(b)).\nHere\n\u03b7ba = \u03a3i Mbi M ai\nso that \u03b7 = MM t where M t denotes the transpose of the matrix M.\nand \u03c1 : Bn \u2212\u2192 T Ln is the matrix representation of the Temperley Lieb algebra specified in Section 3. The key to the workings of this representation of\nthe bracket calculation for braids is the fact that for any pure connection element Q (obtained from a product of the Ui\u2032 s) in the Temperley-Lieb algebra\nT Ln , the evaluation\nT race(\u03b7 \u2297n Q)\nis equal to \u03b4 \u03bb(Q) where \u03bb(Q) is the number of loops in the (braid) closure of\nthe diagram for Q.\nIn general, if we have a linear function T R : T Ln \u2212\u2192 Z[\u03b4] such that\nT R(Q) = \u03b4 \u03bb(Q) for elements Q as above, then T R(\u03c1(b)) = \u03b4 < b > for any\nn-strand braid b.\n\n6\n\nQuantum Computing\n\nIn this paper I have concentrated on giving a picture of the general framework of the Jones polynomial and how it is related to a very general, in\nfact categorical, view of quantum mechanics. Many algorithms in quantum\ntopology are configured without regard to unitary evolution of the amplitude\nsince the constraint has been topological invariance rather than conformation to physical reality. This gives rise to a host of problems of attempting to\n43\n\n\freformulate topological amplitudes as quantum computations. A particular\ncase in point is the bracket model for the Jones polynomial. It would be of\ngreat interest to see a reformulation of this algorithm that would make it a\nquantum computation in the strict sense of quantum computing. One way to\nthink about this is to view the bracket model as a vacuum-vacuum amplitude\nas we have done in the last section of this paper. Then it can be configured\nas a composition of operators (cups, caps and braiding). If the braiding is\nunitary. Then at least this part can be viewed as a quantum computation.\nTo see how this can be formulated consider the vacuum-vacuum computation of a link amplitude as we have described it in section 4. In Figure\n20 we have indicated an amplitude where the temporal decomposition consists first in a composition of cups (creations), then braiding and then caps\n(annihilations). Thus we can write the amplitude in the form\nZK =< CUP |M|CAP >\n6\n\nx\nx\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\nx\n\nx\nx\n@\n@\n@\n@\n\n@x\nx @\n\n< CAP |(Detection)\nQuantum Computation\nM\nUnitary Braiding\n\nx\n-\n\n|CUP > (P reparation)\n\nZK =< CAP |M|CUP >\nFigure 20 - ZK =< CUP |M|CAP > - A Knot Quantum Computer\nwhere < CUP | denotes the composition of cups, M is the composition of\nelementary braiding matrices and |CAP > is the composition of caps. We\n44\n\n\fthen regard < CUP | as the preparation of this state and |CAP > as the\ndetection of this state. In order to view ZK as a quantum computation,\nwe need that M be a unitary operator. This will be the case if the Rmatrices (the solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation used in the model for\nthis amplitude) are unitary. In this case, each R-matrix can be viewed as a a\nquantum gate (or possibly a composition of quantum gates) and the vacuumvacuum diagram for the knot is interpreted as a quantum computer. This\nquantum computer will probabalistically compute the values of the states in\nthe state sum for ZK . In order to do so, we would need to specify those\nobservations and preparations that corresopond to the cups and the caps in\nthe diagram. A more modest proposal is to regard the braiding sector of\nthe diagram as a quantum computer. That braiding sector will represent a\nunitary evolution, and one can ask more generally what can be computed by\nusing such a gate derived from a braid.\nIt should be noted that because the quantum computer gives probabilistic\ndata, it cannot compute the knot invariants exactly. In fact, the situation\nis more serious than that. If we assume that the parameters in the knot\ninvariant are complex, then the computer will only find (probabilistically)\nthe absolute squares of the various complex parameters. Important phase\ninformation will be lost, and it is not obvious that topologically invariant\ninformation about the knot can be extracted.\n\n6.1\n\nA Unitary Representation of the Three Strand Braid\nGroup and the Corresponding Quantum Computer\n\nMany questions are raised by the formulation of a quantum computer associated with a given Morse link diagram. First of all, unitary solutions to the\nYang-Baxter equation (or unitary representations of the Artin braid group)\nthat also give link invariants are not so easy to come by. We gave a small\nexample of a unitary representation of the three-strand braid group in the\nfirst section of this paper. Thus we, are prepared to look at some aspects of\nthe computation of a knot invariant as a quantum computation. In fact, we\ncan use this representation to compute the Jones polynomial for closures of\n3-braids, and therefore this representation provides a test case for the corresponding quantum computation. We now analyse this case by first making\n45\n\n\fexplicit how the bracket polynomial is computed from this representation.\nFirst recall that the representation depends on two matrices U1 and U2\nwith\nU1 =\n\n\"\n\n\u03b4 0\n0 0\n\n#\n\nand\nU2 =\n\n\"\n\n\u22121\n\u221a \u03b4\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u22122\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u22122\n\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4 \u22121\n\n#\n\n.\n\nThe representation is given on the two braid generators by\n\u03c1(\u03c31 ) = AI + A\u22121 U1\n\u03c1(\u03c32 ) = AI + A\u22121 U2\nfor any A with \u03b4 = \u2212A2 \u2212 A\u22122 , and with A = ei\u03b8 , then \u03b4 = \u22122cos(2\u03b8). We\nget the specific range of angles |\u03b8| \u2264 \u03c0/6 and |\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0| \u2264 \u03c0/6 that give unitary\nrepresentations of the three-strand braid group.\nNote that tr(U1 ) = tr(U2 ) = \u03b4 while tr(U1 U2 ) = tr(U2 U1 ) = 1. If b is\nany braid, let I(b) denote the sum of the exponents in the braid word that\nexpresses b. For b a three-strand braid, it follows that\n\u03c1(b) = AI(b) I + \u03c4 (b)\nwhere I is the 2 \u00d72 identity matrix and \u03c4 (b) is a sum of products in the Temperley Lieb algebra involving U1 and U2 . Since the Temperley Lieb algebra\nin this dimension is generated by I,U1 , U2 , U1 U2 and U2 U1 , it follows that\n< b >= AI(b) \u03b4 2 + tr(\u03c4 (b))\nwhere b denotes the standard braid closure of b, and the sharp brackets denote\nthe bracket polynomial as described in previous sections. From this we see\nat once that\n< b >= tr(\u03c1(b)) + AI(b) (\u03b4 2 \u2212 2).\n\n46\n\n\fIt follows from this calculation that the question of computing the bracket\npolynomial for the closure of the three-strand braid b is mathematically\nequivalent to the problem of computing the trace of the matrix \u03c1(b). To\nwhat extent can our quantum computer determine the trace of this matrix?\nThe matrix in question is a product of unitary matrices, the quantum\ngates that we have associated with the braids \u03c31 and \u03c32 . The entries of\nthe matrix \u03c1(b) are the results of preparation and detection for the two\ndimensional basis of qubits for our machine:\n< i|\u03c1(b)|j > .\nGiven that the computer is prepared in |j >, the probability of observing it in\nstate |i > is equal to | < i|\u03c1(b)|j > |2 . Thus we can, by running the quantum\ncomputation repeatedly, estimate the absolute squares of the entries of the\nmatrix \u03c1(b). This will not yield the complex phase information that is needed\nfor either the trace of the matrix or the absolute value of that trace. Thus\nwe conclude that our quantum computer can compute information relating\nto the braiding process, but that it cannot approximate the full value of the\nbracket polynomial.\nNote that our quantum computer does indeed have the capability to detect three strand braiding, since for a braid b the matrix \u03c1(b) can have nontrivial off-diagaonal elements. The absolute squares of these elements are\napproximated by successive runs of the quantum computer. In this quantum\ncomputer, braiding corresponds to entangled quatum states and is dectable\nby that token. The bracket polynomial itself depends upon subtler phase\nrelationships and is not detectable by this quantum computer.\n\n6.2\n\nComments\n\nThese results are less than satisfying since there does not seem to be a way to\ncalculate the entire knot polynomial even by probabilisitic approximations.\nIt is not clear what the practical value of such a computation will be for\nunderstanding a given link invariant. Nevertheless, it is to be expected that\na close relationship between quantum link invariants and quantum computing\nwill be fruitful for both fields.\n47\n\n\fThere are other ideas in the topology that deserve comparison with the\nquantum states. For example, topological entanglement in the sense of linking and braiding is intuitively related to the entanglement of quantum states.\nIn our general model using a unitary representation of the braid group, topological entanglement entails quantum entanglement. The quantum topological states associated with the bracket polynomial would certainly figure\nstrongly in a quantum computing model of this algorithm. The specific\nmodel that we have given uses only one qubit and so does not produce entanglement. There are other representations of the Artin Braid group that\ndo produce quantum entanglements corresponding to topological braiding.\nThese phenomena will be the subject of a subsequent paper [20].\nWe mention one further possibility. In the paper [21] by Lidar and Biham the authors show how to simulate special cases of the Ising model on a\nquantum computer. Their method is more combinatorial and less algebraic\nthan the approach sketched in this section using braiding. It is possible that\na generalization of their approach will work for the state sum of the bracket\npolynomial. This is a topic for further research.\n\n6.3\n\nAnd Quantum Field Theory\n\nFinally, it is important to remark that there is an interpretation of the Jones\npolynomial in terms of quantum field theory. Witten [26] writes down a\nfunctional integral for link invariants in a 3-manifold M:\nZ(M, K) =\n\nZ\n\ndAexp[(ik/4\u03c0)S(M, A)]tr(P exp(\n\nZ\n\nK\n\nA)).\n\nHere M denotes a 3-manifold without boundary and A is a gauge field (gauge\nconnection) defined on M. The gauge field is a one-form on M with values\nin a representation of a Lie algebra. S(M, A) is the integral over M of the\ntrace of the Chern-Simons three-form CS = AdA + (2/3)AAA. (The product\nis the wedge product of differential forms.)\nWith the standard representation of the Lie algebra of SU(2) as 2 \u00d7 2\ncomplex matrices, one can see that the formalism of Z(S , K) (S 3 denotes\nthe three-dimensional sphere.) yields the Jones polynomial with the basic\nproperties as we have discussed. See Witten's paper or [26] or [15],[16].\n48\n\n\fThe question is: How does the quantum field theory approach to the Jones\npolynomial relate to quantum computing? One way to discuss this question\nis to reformulate (topological) quantum field theories as state summations,\nas we did for the Jones polynomial, and then proceed in a fashion analogous\nto our amplitudes discussion above. It is more challenging to try to imagine\nreformulating quantum computing at the level of quantum field theory. If\nthis were accomplished, the subject of quantum computing and the Jones\npolynomial might well take a new road.\n\n7\n\nSummary\n\nIn relating quantum computing with knot polynomials the key themes are\nunitarity and measurement. Much is now surely unforseen. For a good\nsurvey of quantum computing we recommend [1] and [22] and for another\nview of topological issues see [6] and [7]. See [25] for an excellent treatment\nof measurement theory in quantum mechanics and a useage of the Dirac\nformalism that is in resonance with the concerns of this paper.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
