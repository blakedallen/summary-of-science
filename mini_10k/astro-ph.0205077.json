In polar cap models (e.g. Arons & Sharlemann 1979, Daugherty & Harding 1996),\nacceleration occurs in the region of open field near the magnetic poles and \u03b3-rays from curvature\nand inverse Compton radiation produce pairs primarily by one-photon pair production in the\nstrong magnetic field. These pairs may screen the accelerating electric field through the trapping\nand reversal of one sign of charge, and may be required for the coherent radio emission process.\nIn outer gap accelerators (e.g. Cheng, Ho & Ruderman 1986), a vacuum gap develops along the\nnull charge surface and pairs are required to provide current flow through the gap which can then\noperate as a stable accelerator.\nIn this paper we discuss plausible regimes of pair formation above the pulsar polar cap\n(PC), including the energetics of relativistic particles and \u03b3-rays that cause and accompany these\nregimes. We treat the acceleration of particles within the framework of an approach elaborated by\nHarding & Muslimov (1998, hereafter HM98), Harding & Muslimov (2001, hereafter HM01), and\nHarding & Muslimov (2002, hereafter HM02) which combines rough analytic estimates and simple\npractical formulae with detailed numerical calculations. As an underlying PC acceleration model,\nwe employ the general-relativistic version of a space-charge limited flow model developed earlier\nby Muslimov & Tsygan (1992, hereafter MT92) and advanced in a number of important aspects\nby HM98, HM01, and HM02. The main focus of our present study is the physical condition\nfor pair formation and how this condition translates into a theoretical pair death line for the\nobserved radio pulsars. This paper is a logical epilogue of our previous studies (see HM01 and\nHM02) where we calculated the parameters of pair-formation fronts (PFF), including the flux of\nreturning positrons, calculated X-ray luminosities due to PC heating, estimated luminosity of\nthe primary beam, and revised derivation of pulsar death lines. In our calculations of PFFs we\nemployed the standard mechanism of magnetic pair-production by high-energy photons, generated\nvia curvature radiation (CR) and/or inverse Compton scattering (ICS). In HM02 we calculated,\nboth analytically and numerically, the theoretical pair death lines based on the abovementioned\nregimes of pair formation. However, in HM02 we presented the results of our calculation of pulsar\ndeath lines only for a canonical neutron star (NS) with the mass 1.4 M\u2299 and radius 10 km, even\nthough we pointed out that the effect of deviation of NS mass and radius from their canonical\nvalues might be important for our calculations.\nIn the present study we extend our previous analysis (HM02) of pulsar death lines to explicitly\nincorporate the effect of different NS mass and radius and, for the short-period (millisecond)\npulsars, to include the possibility of two-photon pair formation. We must emphasize that the\neffect of bigger NS mass is especially worth considering for the millisecond (ms) pulsars, which are\nbelieved to be descendants of accreting NSs in low-mass binary systems. It is remarkable, that\nour present study suggests that the ms pulsars do favour the bigger NS masses which seems to be\nconsistent with their standard evolutionary scenario. This effect is associated with the dominance\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nof the relativistic frame-dragging term in the accelerating voltage drop which is a unique feature\nof the electrodynamic model of MT92. The frame-dragging component of the electric potential\n(field) is proportional to the general-relativistic parameter \u03ba = \u01ebI/M R2 , where \u01eb = rg /R, rg is the\ngravitational radius of a NS of mass M , and I and R are the stellar moment of inertia and mass,\nrespectively. Another important aspect of our previous and present studies is the derivation of a\ntheoretical relationship between the pulsar's \u03b3-ray luminosity and its spin-down power/luminosity.\nIn this paper we discuss such a relationship in the context of the available and forthcoming \u03b3-ray\nobservations of pulsars.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we discuss the determination of pair death lines in\npulsars. First, we outline the basic definition and main assumptions behind the death-line concept\n(\u00a72.1). Second, we discuss the revised analytic approach in the derivation of theoretical death lines\n(\u00a72.2), and then, in \u00a72.3, we discuss our numerical calculation of death lines. In \u00a72.3.1 we calculate\nthe CR and ICS death lines for the NS models with a canonical mass 1.4 M\u2299 and with three\ndifferent equations of state to illustrate the effect of compactness on our death line calculations.\nIn \u00a7\u00a72.3.2, 2.3.3 we focus on the death line calculations for the short-period (millisecond) pulsars:\nwe discuss how the change in mass and radius of the underlying NS model affects the pulsar\ndeath lines, and present the results of our numerical death line calculation (\u00a72.3.2); we incorporate\nthe effect of two-photon pair production for the PC temperatures 1-5\u00d7106 K and present the\ncorresponding numerical death lines (\u00a72.3.3). In \u00a72.3.2 and 2.3.3 we illustrate separately how\nthe mass of a NS and two-photon pair production, respectively, may affect the death lines for\nms pulsars. In \u00a73 we discuss energetics of the acceleration of primary electrons and present the\ntheoretical relationship between the \u03b3-ray luminosity and spin-down power of a pulsar. Finally, in\n\u00a74 we summarize our main results and discuss their most important implications for pulsars.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nDeath line determination in PSRs\nGeneral overview and definitions\n\nSince the very early attempts to relate the apparent absence of radio pulsars with long periods\nin the P \u2013\u1e56 diagram with the manifestation of the effect of electron-positron pair formation as a\ncondition for their operation, it proved instructive to introduce the term 'death line' to separate\nthe domain favouring pair formation from the domain where it would be prohibited (see Sturrock\n1971; Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Chen & Ruderman 1993, hereafter CR93; and references\nquoted therein). Soon, it became almost a common practice for any theoretical study on radio\npulsars to produce the resulting death lines. Furthermore, some theories developed the idea that\non the P -\u1e56 map it is a death valley (see e.g. CR93) rather than a death line that separates radio\nactive from radio quiet pulsars. It is important that during the past decade the number of new\nradio pulsars with a wide range of parameters dramatically increased, which boosted the various\npulsar population studies. In light of the recent extensive radio pulsar surveys (e.g. Manchester et\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nal. 2001), pulsar population studies, and multi-frequency (from radio to \u03b3-ray) pulsar observations,\nit seems timely to get back to the basic concept of a pulsar death line.\nThe standard definition of a pulsar death line implies that pulsar radio emission turns off if\nthe energetics of accelerated particles drops below the minimum required for electron-positron pair\nproduction. Thus, the standard definition of a death line implicitly assumes that pair-formation\nis a necessary condition for pulsar radio emission, and that pulsars become radio quiet after\ncrossing the death lines during their evolution from left to right in the P -\u1e56 diagram. Obviously,\nthis basic condition may not be sufficient (see e.g. Hibschman & Arons 2001, hereafter HA01;\nfor a most recent study where the sufficient condition assumed was that of pair production with\nhigh enough multiplicity to compeletely screen the parallel electric field), and functioning of radio\npulsars may imply far more complex physical conditions (see Usov 2002 for a recent review).\nHowever, numerous theoretical attempts to produce satisfactory death lines implying even the\nbasic necessary condition meet certain challenges. For example, a number of observed ms radio\npulsars fall below most theoretical death lines. Also, many normal radio pulsars tend to be below\ntheir death lines based on CR pair-formation. For this reason, and to minimize the underlying\nmodel assumptions, our previous (see HM02) and present analyses of pulsar death lines are based\non the minimal requirement regarding pair formation. Note that in all our studies we assume a\ncentered-dipole magnetic field of a NS.\nIn this paper we illustrate how the spread of NS masses and radii may affect the theoretical\ndeath lines for ordinary and, most importantly, for ms radio pulsars. Needless to say, compactness\nof a NS is an important parameter in our calculations of particle acceleration (mostly because the\naccelerating electric field is of essentially general-relativistic origin) and pair formation (because of\na bigger deflection of photon trajectories in the gravitational field of a more compact NS). So, the\ndetailed analysis of the effects of stellar compactness on the results of such calculations would be\nquite interesting by itself. However, this effect is worthy of special consideration in the case of ms\npulsars. The main reason is that the latter are believed to descend from accreting NSs in low-mass\nbinary systems and may represent post-accreting relatively massive NSs. As will be demonstrated\nin Section 2.3.2, the increase in NS mass considerably facilitates pair formation in short-period\npulsars, thus pushing the corresponding death lines down to or below the observed (P ,\u1e56 ) values\nfor ms pulsars.\nWe also consider the effect of two-photon pair production, where \u03b3-ray ICS photons interact\nwith thermal X-ray photons from the NS surface to produce an electron-positron pair. This\nprocess is of primary importance in outer-gap models (e.g. Romani 1996; Zhang & Cheng 1997)\nfor pulsar high-energy emission. Zhang & Qiao (1998) investigated the importance of this process\nabove PCs of normal pulsars, noting that unrealistically high PC temperatures were required. As\nwe will show in this paper, two-photon pairs can be produced more easily above PCs of ms pulsars\nbecause the PC size is larger. We will compute the death line for two-photon pairs as a function\nof PC temperature.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.2.\n\nAnalytic death lines\n\nIn this Section we generalize the analytic expressions for the death lines derived by Harding\n& Muslimov (2002; hereafter HM02) to explicitly include the effect of different mass, radius, and\nmoment of inertia of a NS.\nTo formulate the analytic death line condition we need to know the distribution of voltage\ndrop in the pulsar's PC acceleration region. For a given distribution of voltage we can calculate\nthe characteristic Lorentz factor of a primary electron accelerating above the PC as a function of\naltitude z and pulsar parameters B and P , \u03b3acc (z, B, P ). The accelerated electron generates (CR\nand/or ICS) photons that may pair produce if the condition for the corresponding pair-formation\nprocess (in most cases magnetic pair production) is satisfied. In our previous papers (see e.g.\nHM98, HM01, and HM02) we have demonstrated that use of the pair-formation condition allows\nus to determine the pair-formation altitude as a function of pulsar parameters B and P alone.\nThen, the Lorentz factor of a primary electron evaluated at the pair-formation altitude determines\na minimum Lorentz-factor an electron should achieve to generate a pair-producing photon,\n\u03b3min (B, P ). Thus, the death line condition would require that the Lorentz-factor of an accelerating\nprimary electron is equal to \u03b3min . In our numerical calculation of death lines we can easily keep\ntrack of the fulfillment of this requirement and plot the corresponding points in the P \u2013\u1e56 diagram\nthat constitute the death line (or rather death curve). However, an analytic derivation of the\ndeath line needs an additional independent relationship between the pair-formation altitude z and\npulsar parameters B (or \u1e56 ) and P . In our previous paper (HM02) we have demonstrated that \u03b3acc\ncan be expressed as a function of B , P and an additional parameter, the efficiency of converting\npulsar spin-down power into the luminosity of the primary beam,\nfprim = Lprim /\u0116rot ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Lprim is the luminosity of the primary electron beam, and \u0116rot is the pulsar spin-down\npower (= \u03a94 B02 R6 /6c3 f (1)2 , where B0 /f (1) is the surface value of the magnetic field strength\ncorrected for the general- relativistic red shift; all other quantities have their usual meaning and\nwill be defined below; see also HM02 for details).\nFor the typical radio pulsar parameters P and \u1e56 and for most obliquities, excluding the\npure orthogonal case, the dominant term in the expressions for the electrostatic potential and\nelectric field in the general-relativistic version of the space-charge limited flow model (MT92) is\nproportional to parameter \u03ba. In this paper we shall use the following general expression for the\nparameter \u03ba to include its explicit dependence on NS radius and moment of inertia\n\u03ba \u2261 \u01ebI/M R2 = 0.15 \u00d7 I45 /R63 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a NS compactness parameter, I45 = I/1045 g*cm2 , R6 = R/106 cm; M , R and I are NS\nmass, radius and moment of inertia, respectively.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nThen, the explicit expression for \u03b3acc can be written as (cf HM02, equation [51])\n\u03b3acc = 107 fprim B12 P \u22122 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u22125/2\nfprim = f \u0304prim \u03ba0.15 R6 .\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\nand the z dependence of \u03b3acc in implicit in fprim. Here f \u0304prim is the efficiency of converting\nspin-down luminosity into the luminosity of the primary beam, calculated for a canonical NS mass\nM = 1.4 M\u2299 , radius R = 106 cm, and moment of inertia I = 1045 g*cm2 ; and \u03ba0.15 = \u03ba/0.15;\nB12 = B0 /1012 G, B0 is the surface value of the magnetic field strength; P is the pulsar spin period\nin seconds. Since the efficiency fprim depends on the NS radius and moment of inertia, we simply\nnormalize it by f \u0304prim to make more illustrative the comparison with our calculations performed for\na canonical NS model. Note that in formula (4) the parameter fprim is assumed to be independent\nof B and P , but scales with \u03ba and R6 in the same way the \u03b3acc (or the corresponding acceleration\npotential drop, see eq. [49] in Paper I) does.\nA major advantage of the above formula for \u03b3acc is that it does not discriminate between\nunsaturated and saturated regimes of acceleration of primary electrons (see HM02). It implies\nthat the Lorentz factor of an accelerating electron is merely proportional to the maximum voltage\ndrop above PC, with the coefficient of proportionality being the bulk efficiency of the pulsar\naccelerator, fprim .\nNow we can write the pair-formation condition as\n\u03b3acc \u2265 \u03b3min ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3acc is given by formula (3).\nThe expressions for \u03b3min for different underlying mechanisms for pair-producing photons are\nthe same as derived by HM02 but including the explicit dependence on R and \u03ba, and read\nCurvature radiation\n\n(CR)\n\u03b3min\n\n5/14 1/7\n\n\u22121/7\n\n7\n\n(\n\n3.4 R6 \u03ba0.15 P 1/14 B12\n3/4 1/4\n1.2 R6 \u03ba0.15 P \u22121/4\n\n6\n\n(\n\n\u22121\n0.9 R6 \u03ba0.15 P \u22121/6 B12\n5/4 1/2\n\u22121/2\n0.2 R6 \u03ba0.15 P \u22123/4 B12\n\n= 10\n\n(CR)\n\n,\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217\n>\n(CR)\n,\nP \u223c P\u2217\n\n(6)\n\nResonant ICS\n\n(R)\n\u03b3min\n\nNon-resonant ICS\n\n= 10\n\n1/2 1/3\n\n(R)\n\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217 ,\n>\n(R)\nP \u223c P\u2217 ,\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n(N R)\n\u03b3min\n\n5\n\n= 10\n\n(\n\n1/2 1/3\n\n\u22121/3\n\nR6 \u03ba0.15 P \u22121/6 B12\n5/4 1/2\n0.6 R6 \u03ba0.15 P \u22123/4\n\n(N R)\n\n,\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217\n>\n(N R)\n,\nP \u223c P\u2217\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\n(CR)\n\n(R)\nP\u2217\n\n= 0.1\n\n(N R)\n\nP\u2217\n\n4/9\n\n(9)\n\n6/7\nB12 ,\n\n(10)\n\n4/7\n\n(11)\n\n= 0.1 B12 ,\n\nP\u2217\n\n= 0.4 B12\n\nare the critical spin periods (see eqs [4]-[6] in HM02) in the criterion defining the unsaturated\n(upper row) and saturated (lower row) regimes of primary electron acceleration.\nNow, let us use formula (3) in criterion (5) to get explicit conditions representing the death\nlines. Note that, following the reasoning of HM02, in criterion (5) we should evaluate \u03b3acc at\nmin , where f \u0304min is the minimum pulsar efficiency needed for pair formation. It is this\nf \u0304prim = f \u0304prim\nprim\nminimum or threshold value of fprim that determines the pulsar death line condition. We must\nmin defines the voltage drop at the\nnote that at the pulsar death line, in the case of ICS, the fprim\nPFF not the final energy of the primary beam (see Section 3). For each of the mechanisms of\ngeneration of pair-producing photons, we discuss in this paper, the resultant analytic death line\n(or rather parameter space with allowed pair formation) in the P \u2013\u1e56 diagram reads\nCurvature radiation\n\nlg \u1e56 \u2265\n(CR)\n\nwhere \u2206I\n\n(\n\n21\n8\n5\n2\n\nmin \u2212 \u2206(CR) (R, I) \u2212 14.6\nlg P \u2212 74 lg f \u0304prim\nI\nmin \u2212 \u2206(CR) (R, I) \u2212 15.4\nlg P \u2212 2 lg f \u0304prim\nII\n(CR)\n\n(R, I) = 1.5(lg I45 \u2212 6.3 lg R6 ), and \u2206II\n\n(CR)\n\n,\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217\n>\n(CR)\n,\nP \u223c P\u2217\n\n(12)\n\n(R, I) = 1.5(lg I45 \u2212 7.3 lg R6 ).\n\nResonant ICS\n\nlg \u1e56 \u2265\n\n(\n\n5\n6\n2\n3\n\nmin \u2212 2 \u2206(ICS) (R, I) \u2212 16.6\nlg P \u2212 lg f \u0304prim\n3 I\nmin \u2212 2 \u2206(ICS) (R, I) \u2212 17.9\nlg P \u2212 43 lg f \u0304prim\n3 II\n\n(\n\n7\n4\n3\n2\n\nmin \u2212 \u2206(ICS) (R, I) \u2212 18.6\nlg P \u2212 32 lg f \u0304prim\nI\nmin \u2212 \u2206(ICS) (R, I) \u2212 20.0\nlg P \u2212 2 lg f \u0304prim\nII\n\n(R)\n\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217 ,\n>\n(R)\nP \u223c P\u2217 ,\n\n(13)\n\nNon-resonant ICS\n\nlg \u1e56 \u2265\n(ICS)\n\n(ICS)\n\nwhere \u2206I\n= (lg I45 \u2212 7.5 lg R6 ) and \u2206II\nconditions we used formula (2) for \u03ba.\n\n(N R)\n\nP<\n,\n\u223c P\u2217\n>\n(N R)\n,\nP \u223c P\u2217\n\n(14)\n\n= (lg I45 \u2212 10.5 lg R6 ). In the above death-line\n\nThe expressions (12)-(14) differ from the similar expressions presented in HM02 (see eqs\n[52]-[54]) by the terms \u2206's which take into account the deviation of NS radius and moment of\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ninertia from the canonical values of 106 cm and 1045 g*cm2 , respectively. Thus, for canonical NS\nparameters, the above expressions translate into expressions [52]-[54] of HM02. One can see from\nexpressions for \u2206's that the more compact the NS is, the lower the death line moves.\nThe analytic expressions above for the ICS pair death lines differ significantly from those\nderived by Zhang et al. (2000). The reasons for these differences were discussed in detail in HM02.\n\n2.3.\n2.3.1.\n\nNumerical death lines\nEffect of NS equation of state\n\nThe details of the method we use to numerically compute pair death lines can be found\nin HM02. Briefly, we keep track of the total distance, the sum of the acceleration length and\nthe pair production attenuation length of either CR or ICS radiated photons, as the primary\nelectron is accelerating. The minimum of this total distance is assumed to determine the height\nof the pair formation front. As the value of surface magnetic field decreases for a given pulsar\nperiod, the PFF moves to higher altitude. Performing this calculation for a range of pulsar\nperiods, we find the value of surface magnetic field below which a PFF cannot form within the\npulsar magnetosphere. This occurs because both the required acceleration length and the pair\nattenuation length become very large. The result is a line in P -B0 space which we identify as the\ndeath line for pair production by photons of a given radiation type. In order to compare death\nlines for different equations of state (EOS) with the observed pulsar population we must transform\nthe calculated lines to P -\u1e56 space using the magneto-dipole spin-down relation\n\"\n\n3c3 I \u1e56 P\nB0 =\n2\u03c0 2 R6\n\n#1/2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\ngiving\n\u221216\n\n\u1e56 = 2.43 \u00d7 10\n\nR66\nI45\n\n!\n\n2\nB12\nP\n\n!\n\ns * s\u22121 .\n\n(16)\n\nIn our numerical death line calculations we employ three most representative NS models\nstandardly used in the calculations of thermal evolution of NSs (see e.g. Table 1 in Umeda et.\nal 1993 and references quoted therein) plus a strange star model (see e.g. Glendenning, 1997).\nThe NS models correspond to a star with the baryon mass 1.4 M\u2299 , and different radii and\nmoments of inertia: R6 = 1.6 and I45 = 2.2 (Pandharipande-Pines-Smith'76 model); R6 = 1.1\nand I45 = 1.2 (Friedman-Pandharipande'81 model without pion condensate); and R6 = 0.8 and\nI45 = 0.6 (Baym-Pethick-Sutherland'71 model). The strange star model has a mass 1.4 M\u2299 ,\nradius R6 = 0.7, and moment of inertia I45 = 0.7. In Figure 1 we show the death line calculations\nbased on these models. Note that the stellar models were produced for a non-rotating star. Thus,\nstrictly speaking, our calculations of death lines shown in Figure 1 are not very accurate for the\nms pulsars. However, as it will be discussed in the next Section our death line calculations based\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\non a non-rotating NS (and perhaps strange star) model may still be satisfactory even in the ms\nrange. We should also mention that the only purpose of our inclusion of a strange star model is to\ndemonstrate the effect of extreme stellar compactness on our death line calculations. The surface\nphysics of a strange star may be significantly different from that of a NS, and in this paper we\nrefrain from any speculation on this issue. It was suggested although that some radio pulsars could\nwell be strange stars rather than NSs (see e.g. Xu, Qiao & Zhang 1999; Kapoor & Shukre 2001).\nAs was suggested by our analytic expressions in Section 2.2, EOS with smaller radii will\nmove the death line lower, allowing a greater number of pulsars to produce pairs. Pair production\nis thus facilitated in more compact stars with bigger \u03ba's and having softer EOS or even having\nstrange matter EOS. We demonstrated this effect by employing the BPS NS model and more or\nless typical strange star model available in the literature. The death line corresponding to the\nstrange star model (having largest compactness parameter) is the lowest one of those shown in\nFigure 1. Note, that the ICS pair death lines are more strongly affected by a change in NS radius\nthan are the CR pair death lines. In this paper we have computed ICS death lines for only one\nPC temperature of 106 K in order to compare the effect of EOS. In HM02, we showed that PC\ntemperature has only a small effect on ICS pair death lines for normal pulsars and is much less\nsignificant than the effect of different NS EOSs. For a PC temperature of 5 \u00d7 106 K and canonical\nNS model, the ICS pair death line lies slightly below the BPS model death line shown in Figure 1.\n\n2.3.2.\n\nEffect of NS mass for death lines in ms PSRs\n\nIn our calculations of death lines for pulsars with the periods in the range of 0.001-0.1 s we use\nrapidly rotating NS models produced by Friedman, Ipser & Parker (1986). In Figure 2 we present\nour calculated death lines for NSs with the gravitational masses 1.26, 1.97, and 2.64 M\u2299 . This\nparticular sequence of rotating NS models is calculated by employing the Pandharipande-Smith'75\nEOS and corresponds to the NS spin period of \u2248 2 ms. The NS radii and moments of inertia for\nthis sequence are, respectively, R6 = 1.59 and I45 = 2.28, R6 = 1.59 and I45 = 3.9, and R6 = 1.47\nand I45 = 5.18. Note that we used the same sequence of models (implying the NS spin period \u2248 2\nms) to calculate the death lines for the whole range of spin periods up to 0.1 s. In fact, for the\n>\nspin periods \u223c 10 ms the rotating NS models practically converge with the non-rotating models.\nNote also that, for these three models the relative differences between non-rotating and rotating\nsequences in terms of, respectively, the gravitational mass, radius, and moment of inertia, are 3%,\n10%, and 8% (for 1.26 M\u2299 model); 1.5%, 5%, and 5% (for 1.97 M\u2299 model); and 6%, 8%, and 4%\n(for 2.64 M\u2299 model). The differences between rotating and non-rotating models of this magnitude\nare more or less typical for other sequences of models based on a reasonable EOS. Thus, the effect\nof rotation, by itself, is not very important for the death line calculations, and we can justifiably\nuse this particular sequence of models for our death line calculations for the period range under\nconsideration. What may actually be important for the death line calculations in ms pulsars is the\nmass of a NS. We find that our numerical calculations of death lines in ms pulsars favour more\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nmassive NS models, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the ms pulsars descend from\naccreting NSs in low-mass binaries. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of NS mass on the death line\ncalculations for the ms pulsars. It shows that the increase in NS (gravitational) mass by 0.6-0.7\nM\u2299 moves the death line down by a factor of a few or more (see also formula [14], saturated case).\nEven though the mass of 2.64 M\u2299 we use in our calculations may seem to be rather large, the\nmain result of our calculations shown in Figure 2 is that the increase in the NS baryon mass by\n\u223c 30 \u2212 60% may significantly facilitate the process of pair formation above the PC in a ms pulsar.\nThis effect may account for the fact that many ms pulsars tend to scatter below the theoretical\ndeath lines. The fact that the ms pulsars might be more massive NSs processed in binary systems\ncould naturally explain this effect.\n\n2.3.3.\n\nEffect of two-photon pair formation\n\nWe also investigate the effect of two-photon pair production on the pair death line. The\nprocess we consider is that of ICS photons interacting with soft X-ray photons from the hot PC,\ndrawing from the same pool of thermal photons that are responsible for creating the ICS photon\nspectrum. In PC models, two-photon pair production has traditionally not been considered\nimportant in comparison to one-photon pair production. Zhang & Qiao (1998) noted that\ntwo-photon pair production could be important in PC models if the temperature of the PC was\nhigh enough (> 4 \u00d7 106 K for P = 0.1 s). Zhang (2001) estimated the photon attenuation length\nfor two-photon pair production above a hot PC of radius Rt to be\nl2\u03b3 \u2243 4.7 \u00d7 105 T6\u22123 [g(z)\u03a3(\u01eb)]\u22121 , cm\n\n(17)\n\ng(z) = 0.27 \u2212 0.507\u03bcc + 0.237\u03bc2c ,\nz\n,\n\u03bcc = q\nz 2 + zt2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n\nwhere zt = Rt /R, T6 = T /106 K, \u03a3(\u01eb) = (\u03c0 2 /3) ln(0.117\u0398\u01eb)/(\u0398\u01eb), \u0398 = T /mc2 , and \u01eb is the photon\nenergy in units of mc2 . Near the NS surface \u03bcc \u223c 0, and at threshold,\n\u01ebth =\n\n2\n,\n\u0398(1 \u2212 \u03bcc )\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u01eb \u223c 1/\u0398, \u03a3(\u01eb) \u223c 1 so that l2\u03b3 \u2243 1.7 \u00d7 106 T6\u22123 cm. For surface temperatures T6 \u223c 1,\nthe photon attenuation length, l2\u03b3 , is much larger than the acceleration length required for\nthe electron to radiate an ICS photon above threshold. Therefore, l2\u03b3 sets the distance to the\ntwo-photon PFF. Since the soft photon density declines with height above the surface on a scale\nroughly equal to Rt , a reasonable criterion for two-photon pair production is then l2\u03b3 < Rt . Since\nRt = rpc = (\u03a9R/c)1/2 R for a heated PC, this condition becomes\n>\n\n1/2\n\nT6 \u223c 1.6(P/1 ms)1/6 R6\n\n(20)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nFor normal pulsars, T6 > 4 \u2212 5 is required, which is unrealistically high, but for ms pulsars the\ntemperature required for significant two-photon pair production is in the range detected for some\nms pulsars. It is clear that the advantage ms pulsars hold over normal pulsars in the facilitation\nof two-photon pair production is a large PC size, which allows both larger angles between the ICS\n\u03b3-rays and the thermal PC photons thus lowering the threshold energy for producing a pair, and\nan increase in the scale length over which the soft photon density decays. The primary electrons\ntherefore can reach the energies needed to radiate photons at threshold in a shorter distance.\nIn order to compute the two-photon pair death lines numerically, we need an expression for\nthe rate of pair production of a high energy photon of energy \u01eb:\nR2\u03b3 (\u01eb, \u03b8) = c\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bcti\n\nZ\n\nd\u01ebs \u03c32\u03b3 (w) ns (\u01ebs , \u03bcs ) (1 \u2212 \u03bcti ),\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bcti is the cosine of the polar angle between the propagation direction of the two photons,\nand \u03c32\u03b3 (w) is the cross section,\ni\np\np\n\u03c0re2 h\n(2w4 + 2w2 \u2212 1) ln(w + w2 \u2212 1) \u2212 w(w2 + 1) w2 \u2212 1\n6\nw\nin the center of momentum frame in terms of the variable,\n\n\u03c32\u03b3 (w) =\n\nw = [\u01eb \u01ebs (1 \u2212 \u03bcti )/2]1/2 .\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nThe above cross section does not take into account the effect of the strong magnetic field near the\nNS surface. Although these effects may be significant in the highest pulsar fields, the magnetic\ntwo-photon pair production cross section is very complicated (Kozlenkov & Mitrofanov 1986) and,\nsince the process will only be important for ms pulsars having low fields, we will not consider these\neffects here. The above (field-free) cross section may be simplified in two limits, near threshold\nand for large w (Svensson 1982):\n(\n\u221a\nw\u22431\n\u03c0re2 w2 \u2212 1\n\u03c32\u03b3 (w) \u2243\n(24)\n2\n6\n(\u03c0re /w ) [2 ln(2w) \u2212 1] w \u226b 1,\nwhere re is the classical electron radius. We choose the coordinate system so that the z-axis is\nalong the magnetic pole. To simplify the geometry of the calculation, we assume that the \u03b3-ray\ntravels along the positive z-axis, and assume that the soft photons are uniformly radiated over the\nPC. There is thus azimuthal symmetry about the magnetic pole and the polar angle \u03bcti ranges\nfrom 0 to \u03bcc , where \u03bcc is given in equation (18). The thermal photons from the PC are described\nby the blackbody distribution,\nns (\u01ebs ) = (1 \u2212 \u03bcc )\n\n\u01eb2s\n8\u03c0\n,\n\u03bb3c [exp(\u01ebs /\u0398) \u2212 1]\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03bbc is the electron Compton wavelength. Changing variables from \u03bcti to w, and using the\nexpressions for \u03c32\u03b3 (w) defined by equation (24), the expression for the rate in equation (21)\nbecomes\nZ \u221e\nns (\u01ebs )\nc\nd\u01ebs\n\u03a3(ws )\n(26)\nR2\u03b3 (\u01eb) \u2243 16\u03c0 2 re2 2\n\u01eb 0\n\u01eb2s\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nwhere\n\u03a3(ws ) =\nand\n\n\uf8f1\n1\n2\n5/2 \u2212 1 (w 2 \u2212 1)3/2 ] w \u2243 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ns\ns\n3\n\uf8f2 [ 5 (ws \u2212 1)\nh\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 2.39 \u2212\n\n2 ln 2ws\nws\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nws\n\ni\n\nws = max[1, \u01eb \u01ebs (1 \u2212 \u03bcc )/2].\n\n(27)\n\nws \u226b 1\n(28)\n\nEquation (26) is then integrated numerically to obtain the two-photon pair production and\nattenuation length.\nAs in the case of the one-photon PFF calculation, we minimize the sum of the acceleration\nlength and the pair production attenuation length of ICS radiated photons, as the primary electron\nis accelerating. Performing this calculation for a range of pulsar periods, we find the value of\nsurface magnetic field below which a PFF cannot form within the pulsar magnetosphere. Figure\n3 shows the computed pair death lines in P -\u1e56 space that include the possibility of two-photon\npair production for different values of the PC surface temperature. We display three cases for\nillustration: 1) death lines for one-photon pairs only 2) death lines for two-photon pairs only\nand 3) death lines for one-photon and two-photon pairs. All cases assume a canonical NS model\nwith M = 1.4M\u2299 , I45 = 1 and R = 10 km. It is apparent that two-photon pair production is\nnot important at all for any of the known radio pulsar population unless the PC temperature\n>\nT6 \u223c 3. The position of the two-photon death line is sensitively dependent on PC temperature\n<\nfor 3.0 <\n\u223c T6 \u223c 5.0 and then saturates at about T6 \u223c 5.0, reflecting the effect of the two-photon pair\nthreshold. For T6 <\n\u223c 3.0, the ICS photons never reach pair threshold during the particle acceleration.\n<\n<\nFor 3.0 \u223c T6 \u223c 5.0, the photons are pair producing near threshold where the cross section is sharply\n>\nrising, and for T6 \u223c 5.0 the photons are pair producing above threshold where the cross section is\ndecreasing. The two-photon death lines curve upward to become almost vertical with increasing\nP because for longer periods, particles must accelerate to high altitudes to reach pair threshold\nwhere the thermal photon density is declining. Thus, as we had noted previously, two-photon\npair production is only important in short-period and ms pulsars. Since young, short-period\npulsars with high magnetic fields do not have detected PC surface temperatures as high as T6 \u223c 3,\ntwo-photon pairs are effectively not important for any but ms pulsars. The combined one-photon\nplus two-photon death lines blend into the one-photon death lines as one-photon pairs dominate\nat higher fields and longer periods.\nHM02 found that substantial PC heating by trapped positrons returning from an ICS pair\nfront can occur in ms pulsars if PC temperatures exceed T6 \u223c 1. In order for ms pulsars to sustain\nthese high temperatures through PC heating, the heated area must be much smaller than the area\nof the standard PC, which is Apc = \u03c0R2 (\u03a9R/c). This is in fact consistent with the non-uniform\nheating distribution found by HM02. However, for the PC temperatures T6 > 3 needed for\ntwo-photon pair production the question of the stability of two-photon PFFs must be addressed.\nPositrons returning from the PFF will radiate ICS photons which can produce two-photon pairs\nin a relatively small distance because the pair production threshold (see eq. [19]) is much lower\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nfor head-on collisions. Creation of enough two-photon pairs by the returning positrons at high\naltitudes could disrupt the acceleration of the primary electrons. Investigation of this effect will\nrequire inclusion of full angular dependence of the pair production rate and will be considered in\na future paper.\n\n3.\n\nAcceleration and \u03b3\u2212ray luminosity\n\nEstablishing the regimes of pair formation above pulsar PCs is not only important for\nunderstanding the behavior of the radio emission, but also allows us to predict regimes of particle\nacceleration and thus high-energy emission since the acceleration of the primary particles may\nbe limited by screening at a PFF. HM02 found that CR pairs are very effective in screening the\nelectric field at the PFF, whereas ICS pairs are less effective and may only screen the electric field\nabove the PFF in some cases. They found that when ICS screening does occur, it only screens\nthe field locally but will not screen at higher altitudes. Thus ICS pairs may retard but do not\nultimately limit acceleration of the primary electrons, which may then also produce CR pairs\nat higher altitude. In fact, the luminosity of the thermal X-rays from a hot PC detected from\nPSR B1929+10, a 3 Myr old pulsar where a detectable cooling component is not expected, would\nrequire and is consistent with heating by positrons produced at a CR pair front (HM01) since the\nheating by positrons produced only at a ICS pair front would not be detectable (HM02).\nThe luminosity of the primary electron beam in the PC pulsar model can be calculated as\nLprim = \u03b1c\nwhere\n|\u03c1e | =\n\nZ\n\n|\u03c1e |\u03a6dS,\n\n\u03a9B0 f (\u03b7)\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba),\n2\u03c0c\u03b1\u03b7 3 f (1)\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nis the value of an electron charge density calculated at cos \u03c7 \u2248 1 (where \u03c7 is the pulsar obliquity),\n\u03a6(z, \u03be, \u03c6) is the electric potential, and\ndS =\n\n\u03a9R3 3\n\u03b7 \u03bed\u03bed\u03c6\ncf (\u03b7)\n\n(31)\n\nis the element\nq of a spherical surface cut by the last open field lines at the radial distance r (= R\u03b7).\nHere \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 rg /R , rg is the gravitational radius of a NS; c is the velocity of light; z is the\naltitude above the PC in units of stellar radius; \u03be is the magnetic colatitude of a field line scaled\nby the magnetic colatitude of the last open field line; and \u03c6 is the magnetic azimuthal angle.\nIn our previous papers (see e.g. HM02) we calculated Lprim using in formula (29) the\nexpression for the electric potential evaluated at the relatively smaller altitudes (both for the\nunsaturated and saturated regimes of acceleration of primaries) where the bulk of the CR\npair-formation and electric field screening occur. In the regime where CR pairs are created, i.e.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nabove the CR death line, the luminosity of the primary beam is therefore set by the CR pair front.\nHM02 derived the following expressions for the luminosity of the primary electron beam based on\nthe altitude of the CR pair front,\n(CR)\nLprim\n\n16\n\n= 10\n\n1/2\n\n(erg/s)\n\n1/2\n\u0116rot\n\n(\n\n\u22121/7\n\nP 1/14 B12\n0.3 P \u22121/4\n\n(CR)\n\n,\nP<\n\u223c P\u2217\n>\n(CR)\n.\nP \u223c P\u2217\n\n(32)\n\nIn the case where there are no pairs produced by CR (and therefore no electric field screening) the\nmost appropriate expression for the electric potential in this case is (see eq. [24] in HM01, and eq.\n[13] in HM98)\n( 3\nz\n\u03a9R\n2\n\u0011 rpc /R \u226a z < 1,\n\u03a6|cos \u03c7\u22481 = \u03a60\n(33)\n(1 \u2212 \u03be )\u03ba 12 \u0010\n1\n\u03b7 \u2212 1 \u2265 1,\nf (1)c\n2 1 \u2212 \u03b73\n\nwhere \u03b7 = r/R. This formula applies for the altitudes much greater than the PC radius and\ncorresponds to the saturated and unscreened regime of acceleration of primaries. However, in some\ncases the acceleration of primary electrons may be limited by CR losses, where general formula\n(29), that does not take into account the radiation reaction of accelerating particles, may not be\napplicable.\nAfter substituting expression (30) for |\u03c1e | and the above expression for \u03a6 into formula (29),\nand performing integration over \u03be and \u03c6, we get\n1\n3\nLprim (\u03b7)|cos \u03c7\u22481 = \u03ba(1 \u2212 \u03ba) 1 \u2212 3 \u0116rot .\n4\n\u03b7\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(34)\n\nFormally, in the above formula we should put \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e to calculate the maximum power in the\nprimary beam. Thus, for the maximum power of the primary beam we can write (see MH97, eq.\n[76])\n3\n(35)\nLprim,max = \u03ba(1 \u2212 \u03ba)\u0116rot .\n4\nTo estimate the pulsar bolometric photon luminosity it is reasonable to assume that\nL\u03b3 \u2248 0.5Lprim,max , where Lprim,max is given by formula (35). Then, using expression (2)\nfor \u03ba we can write\n\u0012\n\u0013\nI45\nI45\nL\u03b3 \u2248 0.05 3 1 \u2212 0.15 3 \u0116rot .\n(36)\nR6\nR6\nThus, the energetics of CR photons generated by accelerating electrons above the pulsar PC is\nproportional to the pulsar spin-down luminosity, and, according to formula (36), the maximum\nefficiency of conversion of pulsar spin-down power into the high-energy quanta may amount to\n10%. Note that this estimate of efficiency implies that only half of the power of accelerating\nelectrons gets consumed by \u03b3-ray photons.\nIn Figure 4 we plot the predicted high-energy luminosity as a function of spin-down luminosity.\nIn the CR pair regime, where eq. (32) applies, we have plotted the luminosity for the screened\n34\n\u22121\nunsaturated case (see top eq.[32]). Below the CR death line, \u0116rot <\n\u223c 10 erg s , the luminosity\nfor the unscreened case of equation (32) applies. Also plotted are the luminosities of the pulsars\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nwith detected high-energy emission and their predicted luminosities. The detected high-energy\npulsars are all above the CR death line, although Geminga and PSR B1055-52 are just above the\n1/2\nline. The detected high energy pulsars seem to follow the predicted relationship, L\u03b3 \u221d \u0116rot . We\n34\n\u22121\npredict that this relationship will break to L\u03b3 \u221d \u0116rot at Erot <\n\u223c 10 erg s , so that older pulsars\nwill have lower predicted luminosities than what would be predicted by an extrapolation of the\ntrend seen in the younger pulsars. Non-thermal high-energy emission has in fact not been detected\nfrom older nearby pulsars such as PSR B1929+10 and PSR B0950+08, although a thermal\nemission component has been detected from PSR B1929+10 (Wang & Halpern 1997) which may\nbe due to PC heating (see HM01). EGRET upper limits for pulsed emission from these pulsars\n(Thompson et al. 1994) are plotted in Figure 4 and lie above the predicted luminosities, but\nnot by much. GLAST should be able to detect \u03b3-ray emission from these older pulsars and test\nthe predicted L\u03b3 \u221d \u0116rot dependence and its location. Note that the break value of \u0116rot in the\nL\u03b3 (\u0116rot ) dependence depicted in Figure 4, can be estimated by equating the screened expression\n(CR)\nfor L\u03b3 \u2248 0.5Lprim (\u0116rot ) given by formula (32) at L\u03b3,max \u2248 0.5Lprim,max , where Lprim,max is given\nby formula (35),\n1/2\n(37)\n5 \u00d7 1015 \u0116rot P \u22121/4 = 0.04 \u0116rot ,\nwhich gives\n\u22122/7\n\n\u0116rot,break = 1.4 \u00d7 1034 P \u22121/7 B12\n\nerg * s\u22121 .\n\n(38)\n\nFor P \u2248 0.1 s, B12 \u2248 4, which is shown in Figure 4, \u0116rot,break \u2248 6.6 \u00d7 1033 erg*s\u22121 . Because of the\n\u22122/7\nB12 dependence \u0116rot,break should generally occur at higher \u0116rot values for ms pulsars.\nThere are a number of ms pulsars which, according to equation (32), should have observable\nhigh-energy emission. Several of these, including PSR J0437-4715, PSR J0030+0451, PSR\nJ1824-2452 and PSR J0218+4232, have non-thermal pulsed X-ray emission components but have\nnot, with the possible exception of PSR J0218+4232 (see Kuiper et al. 2000), been detected\nin the \u03b3-ray band. It is important to remember, however, that the predicted luminosity L\u03b3 is\na bolometric luminosity. The luminosity in a particular band is very dependent on the actual\nemission spectrum. The \u03bdF\u03bd spectra of the bright \u03b3-ray pulsars all peak in the \u03b3-ray or hard\nX-ray bands with typical high-energy turnovers around several GeV. The high-energy spectrum of\nthe ms pulsars may be quite different. The bulk of the ms pulsars are near or below the CR death\nline, so that their accelerating electric field is unscreened. The accelerating primary electrons will\nreach an energy where CR losses are compensated by the acceleration energy gain (see also Luo et\nal. 2000),\n1/4 1/4\n\u03b3CRR = 1.8 \u00d7 107 B12 \u03ba0.15 P \u22121/4 .\n(39)\nThe CR emission spectrum of these electrons will be quite hard (photon index \u22122/3) and will not\nbe cutoff by magnetic pair production at an energy of a few GeV, but will extend to the natural\ncutoff of the CR spectrum at\n\u01ebCR\n\n3\nB12 \u03ba0.15\n3 h\u0304 \u03b3CRR\n= 2.3 \u00d7 105\n=\n2\n2 mc \u03c1c\nP\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00133/4\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nwhere \u03c1c is the radius of curvature of a dipole field line. The CR \u03bdF\u03bd spectrum of the ms pulsars\nis therefore expected to peak at 50-100 GeV energies. The numerical model spectra for millisecond\npulsars of Bulik et al. (2000) have also shown this result. The high energy curvature radiation\nfrom ms pulsars therefore falls in an energy band that has been above that of satellite detectors like\nEGRET and below that of air Cherenkov detectors. There could be a second spectral component\nof almost comparable total luminosity due to the synchrotron pair cascade from ICS pairs, but\nthe \u03bdF\u03bd spectrum of this component would peak at much lower energies. There is also a question\nof whether two-photon pairs could screen the accelerating field and limit the voltage to very low\nvalues. Our preliminary investigations indicate that screening by two-photon pairs occurs only for\n>\nNS surface temperatures high enough (T6 \u223c 4) that two-photon pairs from returning positrons\nis likely to disrupt the acceleration (see discussion at end of Section 2.3.3). This issue will be a\nsubject for future, more detailed investigation.\n\n4.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have outlined the status of two basic regimes of primary particle acceleration\nabove a pulsar PC in the general-relativistic version of the space-charge limited flow model: the\nregime of acceleration with subsequent electron-positron pair formation by CR and screening\nof the electric field, and the regime of unscreened acceleration with ICS pairs and the emission\nof energetic CR photons. For the pulsar physical parameters we discussed in this paper such\nas the pulsar spin period, NS surface magnetic field strength, and PC temperature, the pair\nproduction may involve both the one-photon (magnetic) and two-photon (mostly \u03b3-ray ICS\nphotons on thermal X-ray photons) mechanisms, with high-energy photons generated via CR and\nICS processes. In HM02 we began analyzing the onset of pair formation and addressed how the\ncorresponding pair-formation criterion transforms into the pulsar theoretical death lines. HM02\npresented the death line calculations for the canonical NS model (mass of 1.4 M\u2299 , radius of 10\nkm, and moment of inertia I = 1045 g * cm2 ) and for one-photon pair formation mechanism only.\nHere we extended our study of pulsar theoretical death lines to include the effect of NS mass and\nradius and, for the ms pulsars with relatively hot PCs (T \u223c 3 \u2212 4 \u00d7 106 K), to incorporate the\nmechanism of two-photon pair formation. In the present study we demonstrate that the effect of\nNS mass is important for the death line calculations in ms pulsars. In fact, if the ms pulsars are\nmore massive post-accreting NSs spun-up in low-mass binary systems, then the phase space they\noccupy in the P \u2212 \u1e56 diagram would be consistent with our theoretical death lines calculated for\nNSs with masses more than 1.4 M\u2299 .\nFor the regime of acceleration without CR pairs we calculate the \u03b3-ray luminosity of the\nprimary beam as a function of pulsar spin-down power. It is important that the form of the\ntheoretical L\u03b3 \u2212 \u0116rot dependence is determined by the regime of primary acceleration. For\nexample, for the regime of acceleration accompanied by pair formation capable of screening the\n1/2\naccelerating field L\u03b3 \u221d \u0116rot , whereas for the unscreened regime of acceleration L\u03b3 \u221d \u0116rot . We\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ndiscuss our theoretical L\u03b3 \u2212 \u0116rot plots in the light of currently available pulsar \u03b3-ray data, and\npredict that for pulsars in the regime of unscreened acceleration (with relatively low values of\n1/2\n\u0116rot ) L\u03b3 should turn down from the \u0116rot dependence (see Figure 4).\nThe main conclusions of our study can be summarized in the following way\n\u2022 We revised the prescription for the derivation of pulsar theoretical death lines to include\nthe effect of variation (by more than an order of magnitude) of pair-formation altitude with\npulsar parameters P and \u1e56 .\n\u2022 Pulsar theoretical death lines are strongly affected by the EOS of a NS, with the onset of\npair formation facilitated in more compact NSs.\n\u2022 Theoretical death lines for ms pulsars produced for massive NS models are in a good\nagreement with the empirical death line and with the hypothesis that ms pulsars are\ndescendants of accreting NS in low-mass binaries.\n\u2022 The ms pulsars with relatively hot PCs (temperature \u223c 3 \u2212 4 \u00d7 106 K) may allow the\noccurrence of two-photon pair production, which significantly facilitates pair formation and\nmay also move down the theoretical death lines in the ms range.\n\u2022 We derive a theoretical expression for L\u03b3 and illustrate that it scales simply as \u0116rot or\n1/2\n\u0116rot , respectively, for the unscreened regime of acceleration of the primary beam or for the\nacceleration implying pair formation and screening of the accelerating electric field. We\npredict that the break in L\u03b3 \u2212 \u0116rot dependence, attributed to the transition from the regime\nof acceleration with pair screening to the unscreened regime, might be seen in observational\ndata.\n\nWe acknowledge support from the NASA Astrophysics Theory Program.\n\nREFERENCES\nArons, J. & Scharlemann, E.
