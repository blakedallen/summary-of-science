Wu, G. Peng, L. Liu, Y. P. Feng\u2217\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0501104v1 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 6 Jan 2005\n\nDepartment of Physics, National University of Singapore, 2 Science Drive 3, Singapore 117542\nWe performed ab initio calculation on the pristine and carbon-doped (5,5) and (9,0) BN nanotubes.\nIt was found that Carbon substitution for either boron or nitrogen in BN nanotubes can induce\nspontaneous magnetization. Calculations based on density functional theory with the local-spindensity-approximation on the electronic band structure revealed a spin polarized, dispersionless band\nnear the Fermi energy. The magnetization can be attributed to the carbon 2p electron. Compared\nto other theoretical models of light-element or metal-free magnetic materials, the Carbon-doped BN\nnanotubes are more experimentally accessible and can be potentially useful.\nPACS numbers: 75.75.+a,71.15.Mb\n\nThe discovery of room-temperature weak ferromagnetism in all-carbon system consisting of polymerized C60 [1]\nstimulated wide interest in magnetism of all-carbon materials. One year later after the above discovery, Esquinazi et\nal.[2] detected a ferromagnetic signal from an oriented graphite which behaved quite differently from known magnetic\nimpurities, suggesting an intrinsic origin of magnetism in graphite. In order to understand the unexpected magnetism\nin all-carbon system, some density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out. Lehtinen et al.[3]\nperformed ab initio local-spin-density approximation (LSDA) calculations to study the properties of a carbon adatom\non a graphite sheet and found that this defect has a magnetic moment of up to 0.5 \u03bcB . This was important in\nunderstanding the magnetism observed experimentally in graphite sheet. More recently, Ma et al.[4] studied the\nmagnetic properties of vacancies in graphite and carbon nanotubes. For graphite, the vacancy is spin-polarized with a\nmagnetic moment of 1.0 \u03bcB . The vacancy in carbon nanotubes can also induce magnetism, depending on the chirality\nof the nanotubes and the structural configuration with respective to the tube axis. These calculations provided some\nunderstanding of the observed magnetism in pure carbon systems.\nThe weak ferromagnetism in pure carbon system also stimulated interest in searching for light-elements or metalfree magnetic materials in view of their potential applications as high temperature magnets since metal magnets lose\ntheir ferromagnetism at high temperatures. One of such metal-free magnets was nanographite or graphite-ribbon.\nFujita et al. [5] performed tight binding band structure calculations on graphite ribbons with armchair and zigzag\nedges, respectively. Ribbons with zigzag edges show a sharp peak in density of states at Fermi level, indicating a\npossibility of spontaneous magnetization. Mono-hydrogenation such as zigzag-edged graphite ribbon could create a\nferromagnetic spin structure on their edges. Based on results of first principle pseudopotential calculation, Kusakabe\nand Maruyama[6] further predicted that the zigzag edged graphite ribbon could also have finite magnetization at edges\nby hydrogenating each carbon with two hydrogen atoms while hydrogenating each carbon with a single hydrogen atom\nat the other edge. However, such a hydrogenation of carbon edges is only of interest for theorists. Another recently\nproposed model by Choi and coworkers[7] is the heterostructured C-BN nanotube. They calculated the electronic\nstructure of the (9,0) C1 (BN)1 and C2 (BN)2 nanotubes using density functional theory and found the occurrence of\nmagnetism at the zigzag boundary connecting carbon and boron nitride segments of tubes. However, in view of the\ngrowth conditions of carbon and boron nitride nanotubes, fabrication of the heterostructured C-BN nanotubes may\nbe impractical.\nIn this letter, we report results of our DFT-LSDA studies on the electronic structures of the pristine and carbondoped (5,5) and (9,0) BN nanotubes. We find that the carbon substitution for either boron or nitrogen atom induces\nmagnetization of the doped system, with a total magnetic moment of 1 \u03bcB . Compared to previous models of metal-free\nmaterials, our proposed C-doped BN nanotubes are experimentally accessible as far as the structural configuration is\nconcerned.\nOur calculation is base on the density functional theory and the local spin density functional formulism[8]. The\ncalculation was done using the SIESTA code[9]. The valence electrons are described by linear combination of numerical\natomic-orbital basis set and the atomic core by norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The pseudopotentials generated\nusing the Troullier and Martins scheme[10] are used to describe the interaction of valence electrons with atomic\ncore and their nonlocal components are expressed in the fully separable form of Kleiman and Bylander [11, 12].\nThe generalized gradient approximation correction in the form of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof[13] is adopted for\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: phyfyp@nus.edu.sg\n\n\f2\nthe exchange-correlation potential. The double-zeta plus polarization atomic orbital basis set is employed in the\ncalculation. The Hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated by charge density projection on a real space grid with\nan equivalent plane wave cutoff energy of 70 Ry. Periodical boundary condition is employed along the nanotube axis,\nand a vacuum region of at least 10 \u00c5 is assumed between the nanotube and its images, to avoid tube-tube interaction.\nSpecial k-mesh is chosen along the tube axis according to the Monkhorst-Pack scheme[14]. The conjugate gradient\nalgorithm [15] was adopted to fully relax the structure of the nanotube until the maximum force on a single atom is\nwithin 0.02 eV/\u00c5. For the calculation of carbon doped (5,5) nanotube, we use a supercell which consists of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2\nprimitive cells and contains 80 atoms to avoid possible coupling between carbon images.\nThe calculated band structures of pristine (5,5) and (9,0) BN nanotubes are shown in Fig. 1. The band gaps of\n4.47 eV for (5,5) and 3.81 eV for (9,0) nanotubes agree well with those of ab initio calculation by Xiang et al.[16] The\n(5,5) BN nanotube has an indirect band gap while the (9,0) has a direct band gap. The calculation also reproduces\nthe free-electron-like lowest conduct bands as found by Blas\u00e9 et al. [17] These results confirm the validity of the\napplication of atomic orbital basis set. We also performed spin-polarized calculation on these two pristine nanotubes\nand no spontaneous magnetization was found.\nHowever, when either boron or nitrogen is substituted by carbon, a spontaneous magnetization is induced. The\nband structure of the (5,5) BN nanotube with a boron atom substituted by carbon atom is shown in Fig. 2(a). We\ncan see that the carbon substitution causes a lift up of the Fermi level. All bands with energies lower than -6.0 eV are\nspin degenerate and fully occupied, and thus do not contribute to spin-polarization. However, close to the Fermi level,\na very flat band, almost dispersionless in the whole first Brillouin zone, is split. Only the spin-up branch is occupied\nand the spin-down branch is left unfilled, leading to a strong spontaneous magnetization in the (5,5) nanotube. The\nsplitting between the occupied and unfilled branch is as large as 1.5 eV, The flatness of the spin-polarized band\nindicates that the corresponding electron state is heavily localized, suggesting that the magnetic moment is localized\nat the substitution site, possibly from the carbon 2p electron. We also investigated single carbon substitution for\nnitrogen on the (5,5) nanotube and found that it also produces a spin polarized band around the Fermi level. However,\nthe Fermi level is pushed down. The net magnetic moment is about 1 \u03bcB in both substitutions.\nThe band structure of the (9,0) nanotube with a nitrogen atom substituted by carbon atom is shown in Fig. 2(b). In\nthis case, the Fermi level is pushed down, similar to the case of carbon substitution for nitrogen in the (5,5) nanotube.\nA spin-polarized band occurs around the Fermi level with the spin-up branch occupied and the spin-down branch\nunfilled, resulting in a total magnetic moment of 1 \u03bcB . Similar calculation was carried out for the case of carbon\nsubstitution for boron atom and it was found that the Fermi level increases and the band below the Fermi level is\npartially occupied and spin-polarized, leading to a net magnetic moment of 1 \u03bcB .\nThe spin polarization can also be clearly seen from the spin density of states (DOS), as shown in Fig. 3. For carbon\nsubstituted (5,5) nanotube (Fig.3 (a)), a separate occupied majority spin peak emerges at the energy of \u22124.0 eV.\nBelow this peak, the majority and minority spin density of states are essentially identical. For the carbon substituted\n(9,0) nanotube (Fig.3 (b)), we also can see that near the Fermi level, the majority spin DOS exceeds that of the\nminority. However, the highest occupied spin-up branch merges with the lower valence bands in this case.\nBoron nitride has important advantages over carbon nanotube. It is far more resistant to oxidation than carbon\nand therefore more suitable for high-temperature applications in which carbon nanostructures would burn. Unlike\ncarbon nanotubes, BN nanotubes are insulators, with predictable electronic properties that are independent of their\nchiralities. In addition, magnetic nanostructures are of scientifically interesting and technologically important, with\nmany present and future applications in permanent magnetism, magnetic recording and spintronics. The carbon\nsubstituted BN nanotubes, with conduction electrons that are 100% spin polarized due to the gap at the Fermi level\nin one spin channel, and a finite density of states for the other spin channel, can be an ideal half metallic material and\ncan be useful for spintronic applications, such as tunneling magnetoresistance and giant magnetoresistance elements.\nUpon geometry optimization, all doped nanotubes were spontaneously spin polarized and no visible deformation or\nbuckling in their structures can be observed. Contrast to the models proposed by Kusakabe [6] and Choi [7] in\nwhich the spin polarization only occurs for certain particular structural configurations, the spin polarization in BN\nnanotubes is induced by substitution with arbitrary atomic configuration, indicating easy accessibility of experimental\nsynthesis.\nIn conclusion, we have performed first principle pseudopotential calculation with double-zeta plus polarization\natomic-orbital basis set to study the effects of carbon substitution on BN nanotubes. Our results show that single\ncarbon atom substitution for any atom results in a polarized flat band and a sharp peak in the majority density of\nstate below the Fermi level. The spontaneous spin-polarization is independent of site of substitution and chirality of\nthe nanotubes. Compared to other metal-free magnets previously proposed, the carbon induced magnetization in BN\nnanotubes is experimentally accessible and the system can be potentially very useful.\n\n\f3\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nT.
