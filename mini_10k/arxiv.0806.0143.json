The nuclear modification factor at high pT is sensitive to the earliest form of\ndeconfined matter that does not have a temperature.\n\nKeywords: J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor; the prethermal stage; recombination\nmechanism.\n\n1\n\n\fRecently, STAR collaboration has measured the midrapidity ratio RAA of J/\u03c8 pro\u221a\nduced in Cu-Cu collisions to p-p collisions at sN N = 200 GeV [1]. The ratio is a function\nof the transverse momentum pT . The ratio increases with increasing pT and arrives at\n0.9\u00b10.2 at pT > 5 GeV/c. Error bars at pT > 5 GeV/c are large. If J/\u03c8, \u03c7c and \u03c8 \u2032\nundergo only dissociation processes due to the interaction with gluons of quark-gluon\nplasma [2], the ratio must be smaller than 1 [3]. On the other hand, the transverse momentum larger than 5 GeV/c is very much higher than the average momentum of quarks\nand gluons of quark-gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium. If the J/\u03c8 nuclear modification\nfactor RAA at pT > 5 GeV/c is taken to be larger than 1, how can we understand the\nmeasured pT dependence? This is can be understood from my prediction [4] as follows.\nThe prediction in Ref. [4] is about the ratio of momentum distribution of J/\u03c8 produced\n\u221a\nin central Au-Au collisions at sN N = 200 GeV to nucleon-nucleon collisions. The\npredicted ratio is shown by the solid curve in Fig. 1. The J/\u03c8 production includes the\ncontributions of direct J/\u03c8, the radiative feeddown from direct \u03c7cJ and the decay of direct\n\u03c8 \u2032 . The theoretical ratio is larger than 1 at the transverse momentum between 2.5 and 7\nGeV at rapidity y = 0. This enhancement as stated below is caused by cc\u0304 yielded through\n2 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 2 partonic processes in deconfined matter particularly in the prethermal\nstage [4] and by the recombination of charm quark and charm antiquark [5\u201312].\n\nThe history of a Au-Au nuclear collision at RHIC energies can be divided into four\nstages: (a) the initial nucleus-nucleus collision where quark-gluon matter is produced;\n(b) the prethermal stage where quark-gluon matter thermalizes and a temperature is\neventually established; (c) the thermal stage where quark-gluon plasma evolves and is\ndefined as quark-gluon matter with a temperature; (d) evolution of hadronic matter until\nkinetic freeze-out. Longitudinal expansion of deconfined matter and hadronic matter is\nassumed in Ref. [4]. I stress that quark-gluon matter in the prethermal stage does not\nhave a temperature and is the earliest form of deconfined matter.\nA cc\u0304 pair is produced in the initial nuclear collision, in the prethermal stage and in\nthe thermal stage. The produced cc\u0304 pair is a pointlike color singlet or a color octet pair\nfrom 2 \u2192 1 processes a + b \u2192 cc\u0304 and 2 \u2192 2 processes a + b \u2192 cc\u0304 + x where a, b and x\ndenote partons. The pointlike cc\u0304 pair expands and may get into free states when it travels\nthrough the deconfined matter.\nA charm quark and a charm antiquark can recombine into a bound state with a\nprobability. The probability is proportional to the nonperturbative matrix elements in\nnonrelativistic QCD [13],\n< O8H (3 S1 ) >,\n\n< O8H (1 S0 ) >,\n2\n\n< O8H (3 P0 ) >\n\n\f+\n+ a\nwhere O8H (3 S1 ) = \u03c7+~\u03c3 T a \u03c8 * (a+\n\u03c3 T a \u03c7, O8H (1 S0 ) = \u03c7+ T a \u03c8(a+\nH aH )\u03c8 ~\nH aH )\u03c8 T \u03c7, and\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\ni\n+\nO8H (3 P0 ) = 31 \u03c7+ (\u2212 2i D *~\u03c3 )T a \u03c8(a+\n\u03c3 )T a \u03c7 with \u03c8 as the Pauli spinor field\nH aH )\u03c8 (\u2212 2 D *~\nthat annihilates a heavy quark, \u03c7 as the Pauli spinor field that creates a heavy antiquark\n\nand a+\nH as the operator that creates the quarkonium H in the out state. The nonperturbative matrix elements are constants. In the recombination mechanism proposed in\nRef. [5], the probability for cc\u0304 to form a bound state is a constant.\nWhen cc\u0304 penetrates through deconfined matter, it is broken into a free charm quark\nand a free charm antiquark by reactions\n(1)\n\n(8)\n\ng + cc\u0304[n2S+1 LJ ] \u2192 c + c\u0304,\n(1,8)\n\nwhere n2S+1 LJ\n\ng + cc\u0304[2S+1 LJ ] \u2192 c + c\u0304\n\nis the spectroscopic notation for quantum numbers and for singlet or\n\noctet by the superscript. Cross sections for the reactions were obtained [4] with a formula\nin Ref. [2, 14]. In hadronic matter charmonia are dissociated by mesons into charmed\nmesons via the reactions\n(1)\n\nq q\u0304 + cc\u0304[n2S+1 LJ ] \u2192 qc\u0304 + cq\u0304\nCross sections for the reactions were calculated [4] with a formula of Ref. [15]. Based on\nthese cross sections cc\u0304 survival probability can be obtained.\nMomentum distribution of direct charmonium consists of five terms\n2\u21921\n2\u21922\n2\u21922\n2\u21921\n2\u21922\ndNpre\ndNpre\ndNdirect\ndNini\ndNthe\ndNthe\n=\n(S\n=\n6\n1)\n+\n+\n+\n+\na/A\ndyd2pT\ndyd2pT\ndyd2pT\ndyd2pT\ndyd2pT\ndyd2pT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the five terms result from cc\u0304 pairs produced in the initial nuclear collision via the\n2 \u2192 2 processes, in the prethermal stage via the 2 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 2 processes and in the\nthermal stage via the 2 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 2 processes, respectively. Every term is the product\nof two parton distribution functions convoluted with the product of the short-distance\nproduction part, recombination probability and survival probability. The momentum\nJ/\u03c8\n\ndistribution of prompt J/\u03c8,\n\ndNprompt\n,\ndyd2 pT\n\nincludes the contributions of direct J/\u03c8, the radiative\nJ/\u03c8\n\nfeeddown from direct \u03c7cJ and the decay of direct \u03c8 \u2032 . Let\n\ndN0\ndyd2 pT\n\n=\n\n2\u21922\ndNini\n(Sa/A\ndyd2 pT\n\n= 1) be the\n\nmomentum distribution of prompt J/\u03c8 while the cross sections for charmonia dissociated\nby gluons and hadrons are set as zero. The nuclear modification factor is\nJ/\u03c8\n\nRAA\n\ndNprompt dN0J/\u03c8\n=\n/\ndyd2pT dyd2pT\n\n(2)\n\nThe RAA has been shown in Fig. 1.\nRAA < 1 if Sa/A 6= 1,\n\n2\u21921\ndNpre\ndyd2 pT\n\n=\n\n2\u21922\ndNpre\ndyd2 pT\n\n=\n\n2\u21921\ndNthe\ndyd2 pT\n\n=\n\n2\u21922\ndNthe\ndyd2 pT\n\n= 0, and the charmonium\n\ndissociation cross sections are taken into account. Therefore, RAA > 1 corresponding to\n3\n\n\f2\u21921\ndNpre\ndyd2 pT\n\n6= 0,\n\n2\u21922\ndNpre\ndyd2 pT\n\n6= 0,\n\n2\u21921\ndNthe\ndyd2 pT\n\n6= 0 and\n\n2\u21922\ndNthe\ndyd2 pT\n\n6= 0 indicates that charmonia yielded in\n\nthe prethermal stage and in the thermal stage overcome the loss of charmonia due to the\ndissociation of charmonia in collisions with gluons and hadrons. Now the question left is\nwhy the ratio RAA > 1 can take place at large pT ?\nMomentum and space distributions of partons in the prethermal stage were studied\nin detail in Refs. [16\u201318]. The Fig. 5 given by Eskola and Wang [16] showed the variation of transverse momentum distribution dN/d2 pT with time. Before hard scatterings\npartons are in Gaussian distribution due to the initial state radiation. However, the large\nmomentum transfer in the hard scatterings considerably increases the parton numbers at\nlarge pT and an approximate exponential distribution comes with a larger pT tail. The\nabundance of partons with transverse momenta greater than 5 GeV is exactly a requisite\nwhat we want for getting the enhancement of J/\u03c8 production at large pT as the 2 \u2192 1\nprocesses a + b \u2192 cc\u0304 explicitly lead to large-pT cc\u0304 pairs. The dashed, dot-dashed and\ndotted curves in Figs. 2-3 stand for direct charmonia from the initial nuclear collision,\n\nthe prethermal stage and the thermal stage, respectively. We found that the yield of\ncharmonia resulting from cc\u0304 pairs produced in the prethermal stage can be larger than\nthat in the initial nuclear collision and can be much larger than that in the thermal stage.\nTherefore, quark-gluon matter in the perthermal stage dominates the contributions to\nR > 1.\nWe have seen that R > 1 in the region 2.5 GeV < pT < 7 GeV at y = 0 is a result of\ncc\u0304 yielded from the prethermal stage and by means of the recombination mechanism. In\n\u221a\nCu-Cu collisions at sN N = 200 GeV the thermal stage is shortened or disappeared and\nthe number density of deconfined matter gets smaller. Hence, charmonium dissociation\ngets weaker and less cc\u0304 pairs are produced. But the two factors compete. Since quarks\nand gluons at high pT in the prethermal stage are still abundant, we can expect RAA \u223c 0.9\nor even larger than 1 as a result of deconfined matter in the prethermal stage as well as\nthe recombination mechanism.\nIn summary, the enhancement of J/\u03c8 at high pT at midrapidity is related to the\nearliest form of deconfined matter, i.e., quark-gluon matter in the prethermal stage. The\nnuclear modification factor RAA \u223c 0.9 or even larger is due to cc\u0304 produced in deconfined\n\nmatter in the prethermal stage and the recombination of c and c\u0304.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under\nGrant No. 10675079.\n4\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Z.
