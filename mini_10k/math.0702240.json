I NTRODUCTION\nLet K be a field and D a central division algebra over K. There are two basic numerical invariants\none can attach to D. First, it is a standard fact that the K-dimension of D is a square, say dimK D = n2 ,\nfrom which one can extract n, the index of D. Second, D gives rise to an element of the Brauer group\nof K, which is a torsion group. We can thus read off the order of D in Br(K), known as the period of\nD. Unless noted otherwise, throughout this paper, we will only work with Brauer classes \u03b1 \u2208 Br(K) of\nperiod prime to the characteristic exponent of K.\n1\n\n\fThe principal results of this paper are the following. Given a positive integer M , let M \u2032 denote the\nsubmonoid of N consisting of natural numbers relatively prime to M .\nDefinition 1.1. Let M and a be positive integers. A field k has M \u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a if for\nevery finitely generated field extension L/k of transcendence degree t at most 1 and every Brauer class\n\u03b1 \u2208 Br(L) with period contained in M \u2032 one has ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)a\u22121+t .\nThe case of particular interest is when M = p for some prime p (usually the characteristic exponent\nof K or of a residue field of K under some valuation).\nNotation 1.2. Throughout this paper, when we use the phrase \"Brauer dimension at most a\" we will\nalways tacitly assume that a is a positive integer.\nTheorem (Theorem 6.3). Suppose K is the fraction field of an excellent Henselian discrete valuation\nring with residue field k of characteristic exponent p. If k has M \u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a then K\nhas (M p)\u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a + 1.\nWe can get an inductive corollary as follows. By a d-local field with residue field k we will mean\na sequence of fields kd , . . . , k0 = k such that for i = 1, . . . , d, ki is the fraction field of an excellent\nHenselian discrete valuation ring with residue field ki\u22121 . Natural examples are given by iterated\nLaurent series fields k((x1 )) * * * ((xd )).\nCorollary 1.3. If K is a d-local field with residue field k of M \u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a and characteristic exponent p, then K has (M p)\u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a + d.\nA concrete application of this result yields various instances of the standard conjecture (recalled\nbelow).\nCorollary 1.4. Let L/K be a field extension of transcendence degree 1 and \u03b1 \u2208 Br(L) a Brauer class.\n(1) If K = k((x1 )) * * * ((xd )) is the field of iterated Laurent series over an algebraically closed field and\nper(\u03b1) is relatively prime to the characteristic exponent of k then ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d .\n(2) If K is d-local with finite residue field of characteristic p and per(\u03b1) is realtively prime to p then\nind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d+1 .\n(3) If K is an algebraic extension of the maximal unramified extension of a local field of residue\ncharacteristic p and per(\u03b1) is relatively prime to p, then ind(\u03b1) = per(\u03b1).\nLinking local global, we also prove the following. Let K be a global field and C/K a proper, smooth,\ngeometrically connected curve with a rational point P . For the purposes of this paper, we will refer\nto the following statement as the Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne conjecture. (It is a special case of a more general\nconjecture which may be found in [5].)\nConjecture (Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne). If X is a smooth projective geometrically rational variety over a global\nfield K with geometric Picard group Z, then X has a 0-cycle of degree 1 if and only X \u2297K K\u03bd has a\n0-cycle of degree 1 for every place \u03bd of K.\nTheorem (Theorem 7.2). Assuming the Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne conjecture, any \u03b1 \u2208 Br(K(C)) of odd period\nsuch that\n(1) \u03b1 is unramified over primes dividing per(\u03b1)\n(2) \u03b1|P \u2208 Br(K) is trivial\nsatisfies ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)2 .\nWhen these surfaces are equicharacteristic, i.e., they are surfaces over finite fields, then this is part\nof the standard conjecture for C3 -fields. Moreover, as shown in Corollary 7.4 below, one can deduce\nthe standard conjecture for classes of odd period over fields of transcendence degree 2 over finite fields\nfrom the above theorem.\nThe key idea underlying these results is the observation that one can split ramification of Brauer\nclasses using stacks and produce moduli problems \u2013 twisted sheaves over various kinds of stacky\ncurves \u2013 whose solution gives bounds on the period-index relation.\n2\n\n\fAfter some stack-theoretic preliminaries in Section 2, we describe two methods for splitting ramification by stacks in Section 3. We study the Brauer groups of certain finite classifying stacks in Section\n4 in preparation for a discussion of stacky moduli problems in Section 5. Finally, in Sections 6 and\n7 we use the two different stacky splitting methods to study the local and global period-index results\ndescribed above. At the end is an appendix by Daniel Krashen showing that our local results are sharp.\nTo put this work in context, let us make a few historical remarks and remind the reader of standard conjectures on the relation between period and index. Basic Galois cohomology shows that\nper(D)| ind(D) and that both have the same prime factors, so that ind(D)| per(D)l for some power l.\nThe exponent l is still poorly understood, but the following \"conjecture\" has gradually evolved from its\nstudy. (The reader is referred to page 12 of [6] for what appears to be the first recorded statement of\nthe conjecture, in the case of function fields of complex algebraic varieties.)\nStandard Conjecture. If K is a \"d-dimensional\" field and \u03b1 \u2208 Br(K), then ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d\u22121 .\nThe phrase \"d-dimensional\" is left purposely vague. It is perhaps best to illustrate what it could\nmean by summarizing which cases of the standard conjecture have been proven. In [38], Tsen proved\nthat the Brauer group of the function field of a curve over an algebraically closed field is trivial. (More\ngenerally, his proof shows that any C1 -field has trivial Brauer group.) The next progress in this direction was not made until de Jong proved in [10] that the period and index are equal for Brauer classes\nover the function field of a surface over an algebraically closed field. (By contrast, it is still unknown\nwhether this equality holds for any curve over a C1 -field, or for any C2 -field.)\nThreefolds have so far been quite difficult to handle, and in fact no one has even proven that there\nis a bound on the period-index relation for classes in Br(C(x, y, z)) (or the function field of any other\nparticular threefold). The methods used to prove these theorems have no inductive structure as one\nincreases the dimension of the ambient variety; this is in part responsible for the difficulties faced in\nmaking progress along these lines. For example, de Jong's proof makes essential use of the deformation\ntheory of Azumaya algebras on surfaces, something which one can prove becomes far more complicated\non an ambient threefold.\nIn a slightly different direction (and between Tsen and de Jong in history), Saltman proved in [34]\nand [35] that ind | per2 for curves over p-adic fields, and he provided a method for showing that if K is\nthe fraction field of an excellent Henselian discrete valuation ring with residue field k, and if ind | pera\nfor every Brauer class on every curve over k, then one has that ind | pera+2 for every Brauer class on\nevery curve over K. His techniques provide for a kind of induction as one proceeds up a ladder of\nHenselian fields, with the exponent in the relation increasing by 2 each time.\nThe key to Saltman's method is splitting the ramification of Brauer classes by making branched\ncovers, which allows one to reduce questions on curves over the fraction field to curves over the residue\nfield. Because of the singularities which appear on branched covers, in order to completely split the\nramification of a Brauer class Saltman is forced to make two covers, which is responsible for the\nincrease of the exponent by 2.\nThe methods used in this paper are in some sense a hybrid of the ideas of Saltman and de Jong:\nwe make some branching (either with schemes or stacks) and then use moduli theory to reduce a\nperiod-index relation to a rational point problem.\nConnections between the Hasse principle and the period-index problem are also discussed in [26],\nwhere this connection is used to disprove the Hasse principle (and the Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne conjecture)\nfor smooth projective geometrically rational varieties over C(x, y) with geometric Picard group Z. It\nshould be interesting to investigate this connection in more detail over global fields. Some preliminary\nresults in this direction are described in [23].\nN OTATION\nWe adopt the following notations:\n(1) Given a local ring A with residue field \u03ba and a separable closure \u03ba \u2282 \u03basep , we let Ahs denote\nthe strict Henselization of A with respect to \u03basep . We may occasionally abuse the notation and\nleave the choice of \u03ba ambiguous.\n3\n\n\f(2) Given an abelian group G, we let G\u2032 denote the subgroup consisting of elements of order prime\nto p, where p is the characteristic exponent of the base field.\n(3) Given a (possibly generic) point p of a scheme X, we will write \u03ba(p) for the residue field of p.\nIf X is integral, we will also write \u03ba(X) for the function field (the residue field at the generic\npoint).\nSome additional stack-specific notation will be introduced in Section 2.1.\nA CKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank Jean-Louis Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne, A. J. de Jong, David Harbater, Daniel Krashen,\nDavid Saltman, and Fabrice Orgogozo for numerous helpful discussions, observations, and corrections.\n2. S TACK - THEORETIC\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\n2.1. Notation and basic results. The following notations will be essential.\n(1) Given an algebraic space X, an invertible sheaf L , and an integer n, the \u03bcn -gerbe of nth roots of\nL will be denoted [L ]1/n . This is a stack on X which solves the moduli problem given by pairs\n\u223c\n(M , \u03c6) with M an invertible sheaf and \u03c6 : M \u2297 n \u2192 L is an isomorphism. It is easy to check\n2\nthat the class of this gerbe in H (Xfppf , \u03bcn ) is the image of the isomorphism class of L under\nthe map Pic(X) \u2192 H2 (Xfppf , \u03bcn ) induced by the Kummer sequence (in the fppf topology). In\nparticular, there is a [L ]1/n -twisted invertible sheaf (see Section 2.2 below)M with M \u2297 n \u223c\n= L.\n(2) A surface is a quasi-compact excellent algebraic space of equidimension 2.\n(3) An orbisurface is a quasi-compact excellent Deligne-Mumford stack of equidimension 2 with\ntrivial generic stabilizer.\n(4) Given an integer n, an An\u22121 -orbisurface (resp. Zariski An\u22121 -orbisurface) is a separated regular\ntame orbisurface X with a coarse moduli space \u03c0 : X \u2192 X such that for each point x \u2208 X, the\nhs\nlocalization X \u00d7X Spec Ox,X\n(resp. X \u00d7X Spec Ox,X ) has the form [R/\u03bcn ], where R is a regular\nlocal ring of dimension 2 and \u03bcn acts on mR /m2R by \u03c3 \u2295 \u03c3 \u2228 , where \u03c3 is the standard character\nof \u03bcn .\n(5) Given a stack X , the inertia stack is the relative group-stack I (X ) \u2192 X representing the\nfunctor which to an object \u03c6 : X \u2192 X assigns the group Aut(\u03c6) of automorphisms of \u03c6 in\nthe fiber category of X over X. If X is an Artin stack locally of finite presentation over an\nalgebraic space S, then it is a standard fact that I (X ) \u2192 X is of finite presentation.\n(6) Given a stack X , the stacky locus is the stack-theoretic support of the inertia stack.\n(7) Given a Deligne-Mumford stack X with coarse moduli space \u03c0 : X \u2192 X and a point p \u2208 X, the\nresidual gerbe at p is the reduced structure on the preimage of p in X . (This is a special case\nof a more general notion described in section 11 of [22].) If X is an An\u22121 -orbisurface, then the\nresidual gerbe at any point p is either isomorphic to Spec \u03ba(p) (which we will call trivial) or is a\n\u03bcn -gerbe over \u03ba(p); for a Zariski An\u22121 -orbisurface, the non-trivial residual gerbes have trivial\ncohomology class in H2 (\u03ba(p), \u03bcn ).\n(8) Given a residual gerbe \u03be lying over p with residue field \u03ba, we will write \u03be for the base change of\n\u03be to an algebraic closure \u03ba. (As is often the case, we may abuse notation \u2013 as we have already\n\u2013 and leave the choice of embedding \u03ba \u0592\u2192 \u03ba out of the notation.)\n(9) Given a Deligne-Mumford stack X with coarse moduli space \u03c0 : X \u2192 X and a residual gerbe\nh\nhs\n\u03be \u2208 X over p \u2208 X, we will call the base change X \u00d7X Spec Op,X\n(resp. X \u00d7X Spec Op,X\n) the\nHenselization (resp. strict Henselization) of X at \u03be.\nFor basic results on gerbes, the reader is referred to [11] or, for a condensed discussion, [26] or [24].\nWhen blowing up An\u22121 -orbisurfaces, we will need the following generalization of their local structure:\nDefinition 2.1.1. Given a regular local ring A of dimension 2, an action of \u03bcn on A has type (a, b) \u2208\nZ/nZ\u22952 if the induced representation of \u03bcn on mA /m2A splits as \u03c3 \u2297 a \u2295 \u03c3 \u2297 b . We will also say that the\nquotient stack [Spec A/\u03bcn ] has type (a, b).\n4\n\n\fGiven any tame regular Deligne-Mumford surface, a residual gerbe of the form B\u03bcn has a corresponding type: it is the type of the Henselization of the stack at that gerbe.\n2.2. Twisted sheaves on a topos and deformation theory. Let (X, O) be a ringed topos. For the\nsake of convenience, we will assume that there is a covering U of the final object such that (U, OU )\nand (U \u00d7 U, OU\u00d7U ) are isomorphic to big fppf topoi of schemes. (Among other things, this hypothesis\nensures that quasi-coherent sheaves are an abelian category, and it is satisfied by all algebraic stacks.)\nThe references for the results in this section are [26] and [24] and the references therein.\nLet A be either the sheaf Gm of units or the sheaf \u03bcn of nth roots of unity, with n assumed invertible\nin \u0393(X, OX ). Let X be an A-gerbe on X, and let U be the restriction to U . For any sheaf F on X ,\npullback by automorphisms (i.e., sections of the inertia stack) defines a right action F \u00d7 A \u2192 F .\nDefinition 2.2.1. An X -twisted sheaf is an OX -module F such that the natural action F \u00d7 A \u2192 F\nagrees with the right A-action induced by the (left) module structure on F .\nAs usual, one can define coherent and quasi-coherent twisted sheaves, and one can speak of locally\nfree (quasi-coherent) twisted sheaves. The basic fact underlying the usefulness of twisted sheaves for\nthe period-index problem is the following, which may be found in Proposition 3.1.2.1 of [26].\nLemma 2.2.2. If X \u2192 X is a Gm -gerbe over a regular algebraic space of dimension at most 2 then\nthere is a locally free X -twisted sheaf of rank n if and only if the index of the class [X ] \u2208 H2 (X, Gm )\ndivides n.\nMore concretely, Azumaya algebras on X with Brauer class [X ] are precisely those algebras which\nmay be written as the direct images of trivial algebras End(V ) on X with V a locally free X -twisted\nsheaf.\nThus, if we wish to show that the period equals the index, we need only look for a locally free twisted\nsheaf whose rank equals the period; this places a geometric overlay on the seemingly algebraic periodindex problem. This apparently trivial fact has many useful consequences, some of which we will see\nbelow (and various others of which are described in [26]).\nLet 0 \u2192 I \u2192 O \u2192 O0 \u2192 0 be a small extension of rings in X. Given an A-gerbe X \u2192 (X, O),\ndefine the reduction of X to be the A(O0 )-gerbe X0 \u2192 X0 := (X, O0 ) given by applying Proposition\n3.1.5 of [11] to the map A(O) \u2192 A(O0 ) of sheaves of abelian groups. (This is just a stacky rigidification\nof the pullback map on cohomology H2 (X, A(O)) \u2192 H2 (X, A(O0 )) induced by the map of ringed topoi\n(X, O0 ) \u2192 (X, O).)\nProposition 2.2.3. With the above notation, let F0 be an X0 -twisted sheaf.\n(1) There is an obstruction in Ext2X0 (F0 , I \u2297 F0 ) to deforming F0 to an I-flat X-twisted sheaf.\n(2) If X is a scheme of dimension 1 and F0 is locally free, then for any I we have\nExt2 (F0 , I \u2297 F0 ) = H2 (X, H om(F0 , I \u2297 F0 )) = 0.\n(3) If X is an algebraic stack, the Grothendieck existence theorem holds for formal deformations of\ncoherent twisted sheaves.\nFor further details and proofs, we refer the reader to [24] and [26]. The last statement is not found\nany of the references; it follows from the Grothendieck existence theorem for stacks [31] applied to the\nresults of Section 2.4 below, which shows that gerbes on big sites of algebraic stacks are representable\nby algebraic stacks.\n2.3. Moduli spaces of twisted sheaves. We briefly summarize a few facts about the moduli space\nof twisted sheaves on a curve. The purpose of this section is mostly to fix notation. We refer the reader\nto [24] for further details and proofs.\nLet X/K be a smooth proper curve over a field and G \u2192 X a \u03bcn -gerbe. Given L \u2208 Pic(X), there\nis a moduli stack of stable twisted sheaves of rank n and determinant L, written TwsG /K (n, L). It is\na \u03bcn -gerbe over its coarse moduli space TwsG /K (n, L). Moreover, TwsG /K (n, L) is a form of the space\nof stable sheaves ShsX/K (n, L\u2032 ) for an appropriate L\u2032 \u2208 Pic(X). (In particular, it arises as a twist by\nautomorphisms in PicX/K [n].) Thus, TwsG /K (n, L) is geometrically (separably) unirational; if deg L is\n5\n\n\fappropriately chosen, then it is in fact proper and geometrically rational, with (geometric) Picard group\nZ.\n2.4. A stack on a stack is a stack. We assume for the sake of simplicity that all categories in this\nsection admit arbitrary (non-empty) coproducts and all finite fibered products (whose indexing sets are\nnon-empty), but not necessarily that they have final objects. Given a category S, we will interchangeably use the terminology \"S-groupoid\" and \"category fibered in groupoids over S.\"\n2.4.1. Let S be a category and \u03c0X : X \u2192 S and \u03c0Y : Y \u2192 S two categories fibered in groupoids.\nDefinition 2.4.2. Given a functor F : Y \u2192 X of fibered categories, the fibered replacement of F is\n\u223c\nthe fibered category (Y, F ) \u2192 X consisting of triples (y, x, \u03c6) with y \u2208 Y , x \u2208 X, and \u03c6 : F (y) \u2192 x an\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nisomorphism. The arrows (y, x, \u03c6) \u2192 (y , x , \u03c6 ) are arrows y \u2192 y and x \u2192 x such that the diagram\nF (y)\n\n/x\n\n\u000f\nF (y \u2032 )\n\n\u000f\n/ x\u2032\n\ncommutes.\nThere is a natural functor Y \u2192 (Y, F ) given by sending y to (y, F (y), id) and a natural functor\n(Y, F ) \u2192 Y sending (y, x, \u03c6) to y.\nLemma 2.4.3. Given F : Y \u2192 X as above,\n(1) the natural functor (Y, F ) \u2192 X is a category fibered in groupoids;\n(2) the natural functor (Y, F ) \u2192 S is a category fibered in groupoids;\n(3) the natural functors Y \u2192 (Y, F ) and (Y, F ) \u2192 Y define an equivalence of fibered categories over\nS.\nProof. To check that (Y, F ) \u2192 X is a category fibered in groupoids, suppose (y, x, \u03c6) is an object of\n(Y, F ) and \u03b1 : x\u2032 \u2192 x is an arrow in X. Since Y is a fibered category, there is an arrow \u03b2 : y \u2032 \u2192 y\nsuch that \u03c0Y (\u03b2) = \u03c0X (\u03b1). Since every arrow in a category fibered in groupoids is Cartesian, there is\nan isomorphism \u03c6\u2032 : F (y \u2032 ) \u2192 x\u2032 such that the diagram\nF (y \u2032 )\n\n/ x\u2032\n\n\u000f\nF (y)\n\n\u000f\n/x\n\ncommutes. But this says precisely that (y \u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) \u2192 (y, x, \u03c6) lies over \u03b1. We will be finished once\nwe check that every arrow (y \u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) \u2192 (y, x, \u03c6) is Cartesian. Thus, suppose (y \u2032\u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 (y, x, \u03c6) is\nanother arrow such that the underlying arrow x\u2032 \u2192 x is the same. In this case, we know that y \u2032\u2032 \u2192 y\nand y \u2032 \u2192 y have the same image in S, whence there is a unique arrow y \u2032\u2032 \u2192 y \u2032 over y. This results in a\ndiagram\nF (y \u2032\u2032 )\nGG\nv\nGG\nvv\nGG\nv\nGG\nvv\nv\nG#\n{vv\n/ F (y)\nF (y \u2032 )\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/ x.\nx\u2032\nSince the arrow F (y \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 x\u2032 is uniquely determined by the arrows F (y \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 F (y) and the arrow x\u2032 \u2192 x,\nwe see that there results a map (y \u2032\u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 (y \u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ), as desired.\nThat (Y, F ) \u2192 S is a category fibered in groupoids is a formal consequence of the first part and the\nfact that X \u2192 S is a category fibered in groupoids.\n6\n\n\fIt is immediate that the composition Y \u2192 (Y, F ) \u2192 Y is equal (!) to the identity. In the other\ndirection, the composition (Y, F ) \u2192 Y \u2192 (Y, F ) sends (y, x, \u03c6) to (y, F (y), id). The diagram\nF (y)\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\u22121\n\nid\n\n\u000f\nF (y)\n\n/x\n\nid\n\n\u000f\n/ F (y)\n\u223c\n\nshows that the map (idy , \u03c6\u22121 ) is an isomorphism (y, x, \u03c6) \u2192 (y, F (y), id), which shows that the composition of the two functors is naturally isomorphic to id(Y,F ) . This gives the last statement.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.4.4. Given a category fibered in groupoids X \u2192 S, the forgetful functor and the functor\n\u03bd : (F : Y \u2192 X) 7\u2192 (Y, F ) give an equivalence between the slice 2-category of S-groupoids over X and\nthe 2-category of X-groupoids.\nProof. It is clear by construction that the (strong) equivalence Y \u223c\n= (Y, F ) of S-groupoids proven in\nLemma 2.4.3 is functorial in Y and F . In particular, it follows that given two functors F : Y \u2192 X\nand F \u2032 : Y \u2032 \u2192 X, the functor HomX (Y, Y \u2032 ) \u2192 HomX ((Y, F ), (Y \u2032 , F \u2032 )) is an equivalence of groupoids,\nso that \u03bd is fully faithful (in the strong sense). On the other hand, any X-groupoid H : Z \u2192 X is\nnaturally an S-groupoid (as X is an S-groupoid), and we see from Lemma 2.4.3(iii) that the natural\nfunctor Z \u2192 (Z, H) is an equivalence of categories over X. It follows that \u03bd is essentially surjective,\nand is therefore an equivalence of 2-categories.\n\u0003\n2.4.5. Now suppose that S is a site and X \u2192 S and Y \u2192 S are stacks in groupoids. The fibered\ncategory underlying X has a natural site structure as follows: a morphism y \u2192 x is a covering if and\nonly if its image in S is a covering. Equivalently, a sieve over x is a covering sieve if and only if its\nimage in S is a covering sieve. (To align this with the way one usually thinks of sites in a geometric\ncontext, one could equally well let the objects of the site in question consist of morphisms \u03c6 : V \u2192 X,\nwith V an object of S thought of as a fibered category over S. It is easy to see that this yields a naturally\nequivalent site.) Write X s for the resulting site.\nLemma 2.4.6. Let F : Y \u2192 X and G : X \u2192 S be two categories fibered in groupoids. Suppose S is a\nsite and X is given the induced site structure. If F and G are stacks, then GF is a stack.\nProof. Upon replacing X and Y by equivalent fibered categories if necessary, we may assume that F\nand G have compatible cleavages over S, so that the concept of \"pullback\" is defined and functorial\nwith respect to F .\nWe first claim that Y is a prestack over S, i.e., that the Hom presheaves are sheaves. Let z \u2032 \u2192 z be\na covering in S and y1 , y2 objects of Yz with images x1 and x2 in Xz . Consider the map of presheaves\non S/z\n\u03b9 : Homz (y1 , y2 ) \u2192 Homz (x1 , x2 ).\nSince X is a stack over S, the target is a sheaf. We claim that the pullback of \u03b9 via any map \u03c6 : t \u2192\nHomz (x1 , x2 ) over a map t \u2192 z \u2208 S is a sheaf on S/t . Let \u03c6\u0303 : x1 |t \u2192 x2 |t be the map corresponding to \u03c6.\nSince Y is a category fibered in groupoids over X, the pullback is a torsor under Homx1 |t (y1 |t , \u03c6\u0303\u2217 y2 |t ),\nwhich is a sheaf since Y is a (pre)stack over X. Thus, \u03b9 is a map of presheaves with the codomain a\nsheaf and which is relatively representable by sheaves; it follows that the domain is a sheaf, which\nshows that Y is a prestack over S.\nNow let Y be the stackification of Y as a fibered S-category, constructed in \u00a7II.2 of [11] or in Lemme\n3.2 of [22]. Since Y is a prestack over S, the map of fibered categories Y \u2192 Ye is fully faithful on fiber\ncategories (a monomorphism of fibered categories). The universal property of stackification yields a\nmap of S-stacks Q : Y \u2192 X; letting Ye = (Y , Q) (which is still an S-stack, as it is equivalent to Y ), there\n7\n\n\fresults a diagram\nY ?\n??\n??\n??\n?\u001f\nX\n\n/ Ye\n\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\n\u000f\nS\nof fibered categories over S. Let z \u2208 S, x \u2208 Xz , and t \u2208 Yex . By the construction of Y (and the equivalence\nY \u223c\n= Ye ), there is a covering z \u2032 \u2192 z, an object y \u2032 \u2208 Yz\u2032 , and an arrow \u03c3 : y \u2032 \u2192 t|z\u2032 over the identity of\n\u2032\nz . Let \u03c1 : x\u2032\u2032 \u2192 x|\u2032z be the image of \u03c3 in X, so that \u03c1 is an arrow over the identity of z \u2032 , hence has\nan inverse. There results an isomorphism (\u03c1\u22121 )\u2217 y \u2032 \u2192 t|z\u2032 over x|Z \u2032 . Thus, Y \u2192 Ye is a morphism of\nX-stacks which is fully faithful and such that every object of Ye is locally in the image of Y . It follows\nthat it is a 1-isomorphism of stacks, and thus that Y is 1-isomorphic to a stack on X which is a stack\nover S. The result follows.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.4.7. Suppose X and Y are S-stacks and F : Y \u2192 X is a functor over S. The fibered replacement (Y, F ) is a stack on X and on S.\nProof. We can describe (Y, F ) as the graph of F in the following way: the second projection and the\nfunctor F yield two maps pr2 , F \u25e6 pr1 : Y \u00d7 X \u2192 X. Given an object s \u2208 S and a map f : s \u2192 Y \u00d7 X,\nwe thus get a sheaf Isoms (pr2 \u25e6f, F \u25e6 pr1 \u25e6f ) on s. It is easy to see that this is a \"construction locale\"\nin the sense of \u00a714 of [22]; in fact, this defines a sheaf on (Y \u00d7 X)s . It is well-known that sheaves\nZ on (Y \u00d7 X)s are in bijection with representable morphisms of S-stacks Z \u2192 Y \u00d7 X. The S-stack\nin question here is easily seen to be (Y, F ). To see that (Y, F ) is an X-stack, we note that we have a\ndiagram (Y, F ) \u2192 Y \u00d7 X \u2192 X where each arrow is a stack (the first is even a sheaf). Thus, the result\nfollows from Lemma 2.4.6.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.4.8. The equivalence of Proposition 2.4.4 restricts to an equivalence of S-stacks over X\nand X s -stacks.\nProof. This follows immediately from Lemma 2.4.7.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 2.4.9. Suppose X is an algebraic stack. Given \u03b1 \u2208 H2 (Xf ppf , \u03bcn ), there is a morphism of\nalgebraic stacks \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X and a map \u03bcn \u2192 I (Y ) such that\n(1) for any algebraic space \u03c6 : V \u2192 X , Y \u00d7X V \u2192 V is a \u03bcn -gerbe representing \u03b1|V ;\n(2) the natural morphism of sites associated to \u03c0 is a \u03bcn -gerbe representing \u03b1.\nProof. This follows immediately from Proposition 2.4.8, once we note that a relative \u03bcn -gerbe over an\nalgebraic stack is itself algebraic (as algebraicity is local in the smooth topology).\n\u0003\nThis allows us to carry over the formalism of twisted sheaves (including the Grothendieck existence\ntheorem) to algebraic stacks without any significant changes.\nRemark 2.4.10. The reader uncomfortable with the techniques sketched above can translate the results\nof this paper into the language of Azumaya algebras and their deformations in the \u00e9tale topos of a\nDeligne-Mumford stack, at the expense of knowing a bit more about the \u00e9tale cohomology of such\nstacks. We will not pursue this point.\n2.5. Vector bundles on a stack and descent of formal extensions. Let X be a tame DeligneMumford stack separated and of finite type over a locally Noetherian algebraic coarse moduli space\n\u03c0 : X \u2192 X. Define a stack VX /X (or simply V when X is understood) on the big fppf site of X whose\nfiber category VT over T = Spec A \u2192 X is the groupoid of locally free sheaves on X \u00d7X T .\nProposition 2.5.1. With the above notation, the stack VX /X is an Artin stack smooth over X.\n8\n\n\fProof. In the general case, it is easiest to proceed by Artin's representability theorem [3]. (This requires\ndescending X over an excellent base, which is easily done by the standard techniques in \u00a78 of [14].)\nThis is made significantly easier by the fact that the natural deformation and obstruction modules for\nany object V \u2208 VT (over affine T = Spec A) with respect to the trivial infinitesimal extension A + M (in\nthe notation of [3]) vanish. Indeed, these are described by the higher cohomology of EndXT (V ) \u2297 M ,\nwhich vanishes because the coarse moduli space T of XT is affine and XT is tame. The Schlessinger\nconditions (condition S1 in [3]) then follow trivially, as the set of deformations of an object a \u2208 V (A)\nover any infinitesimal extension A\u2032 \u2192 A is a singleton (!). The infinitesimal automorphisms of V \u2208\nV (A) with respect to the extension A + M are given by End(V ) \u2297A M , which is a finite A-module\ncompatible with arbitrary base change. Finally, the Grothendieck existence theorem for V follows\nimmediately from Proposition 2.1 of [31]. Putting this all together easily yields the result; the reader\nwho is interested in this level of generality is encouraged to work out the rest of the details.\nIn this paper we will only actually need this result when \u03c0 is a flat morphism, and in this case it is\neasy to give a direct proof: it suffices to work \u00e9tale locally on X, so we may assume that X = Spec B\nand X = [Spec C/G], with C a finite locally free B-algebra and G a finite group. In this case, the stack\nV is identified with the substack of G-equivariant locally free B-modules which admit an equivariant\nC-action. It is trivial that locally free G-equivariant B-modules form an algebraic stack locally of finite\npresentation over B, as adding a G-structure amounts to choosing sections of the automorphism sheaf\nsatisfying algebraic conditions coming from a presentation of G. Since everything is finite and flat, it\nis also easy to see that the addition of a C-structure is an algebraic condition (described in terms of\nhomomorphisms between tensor products). The result follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.5.2. Let X be a tame separated Deligne-Mumford stack of finite type over a locally Noetherian algebraic space with coarse moduli space \u03c0 : X \u2192 X. Suppose X = Spec A is affine and I \u2282 A\nbI , U = X \\ Z(I), and U \u2032 = U \u00d7X X \u2032 . Given a locally free sheaf V on the\nis an ideal. Let X \u2032 = Spec A\nopen substack X \u00d7X U and an extension V \u2032 of VU \u2032 to X \u00d7X X \u2032 , there is a locally free sheaf W on X\nextending V and such that WX \u2032 \u223c\n= V \u2032.\nProof. This follows from the previous proposition combined with Theorem 6.5 of [30]. The history\nsurrounding this type of descent problem and various situations in which it holds are also described in\n[ibid.].\n\u0003\n3. S PLITTING\n\nRAMIFICATION\n\n3.1. Splitting by cyclic orbifold covers. We prove a result in the spirit of Saltman [34, 35] on\nmoving the ramification in a cyclic cover. Let X \u2192 T be a regular surface flat over a local Dedekind\nscheme with infinite perfect residue field. Denote the reduced special fiber by X0 . Let \u03b1 \u2208 Br(\u03ba(X))\u2032 .\nBy standard methods [27], we may blow up X and assume that Ram(\u03b1)+X0 is a strict normal crossings\ndivisor, say Ram(\u03b1) = D = D1 \u222a * * * \u222a Dr .\nProposition 3.1.1. Given n > 0, there is a T -very ample normal crossings divisor C such that\n(1) C + D has normal crossings;\n(2) there is an ample divisor H with C + D \u223c nH.\nProof. First, note that X is projective over T (as any multisection which intersects every component of\nthe closed fiber is T -ample). It is easy to see that if H is \"sufficiently very ample\" then C = nH \u2212 D is\nvery ample, thus proving second statement.\nThe crossings of D occur only in the closed fiber. Since k is perfect and infinite, it follows from\nBertini's theorem that there is a section of nH \u2212 D over the reduced special fiber which contains only\nsmooth points of D0 . This hyperplane lifts over all of T , giving rise to C. Since the intersection of C\nwith D is reduced, it follows that C has regular components. Thus, C + D has normal crossings.\n\u0003\nLet X \u2032 \u2192 X denote the cyclic cover resulting from extracting an nth root of the divisor C + D, as in\nsection 2.4 of [17]. By local calculations, one can see that X \u2032 is normal with finite quotient singularities,\nso that the local rings at singular points look like R[z]/(z n \u2212 xy), where R is a local ring of X and x and\ny are a system of parameters.\n9\n\n\fLemma 3.1.2. There is a Zariski An\u22121 -orbisurface X with coarse moduli space \u03c0 : X \u2192 X \u2032 such that\n\u03c0 is an isomorphism over the regular locus of X \u2032 .\nProof. This is made quite easy by the fact that the singularities of X \u2032 are quotient singularities in the\nZariski topology. Let x1 , . . . , xm \u2208 X \u2032 be the (closed) singular points and let V = X \u2032 \\ {x1 , . . . , xm } be\nthe regular locus. For each xi , there is a regular T -scheme Ui with a \u03bcn action and a \u03bcn -invariant\nmorphism Ui \u2192 X \u2032 such that \u03bcn acts freely in codimension 1 and fixes a single closed point. It follows\nthat the induced map from the (regular) quotient stack Ui := [Ui /\u03bcn ] \u2192 X \u2032 is an isomorphism over\nV \u00d7\u2032X [Ui /\u03bcn ]. Gluing the Ui and V together yields X .\n\u0003\nThe following result is the key to the rest of this paper. By using an orbifold resolution of the\nquotient singularities of X \u2032 instead of the standard minimal resolution in the sense of Lipman [27]\n(as Saltman used), we avoid having to think about additional ramification divisors. This results in an\noptimally efficient way of splitting the ramification of \u03b1, in the sense that the function field extension\nhas minimal degree.\nProposition 3.1.3. Let X be the stack constructed in Lemma 3.1.2. There is an Azumaya algebra A\non X with Brauer class \u03b1|X . In particular, there is a \u03bcn -gerbe G \u2192 X representing an extension of \u03b1\nto X .\nProof. Let V be the non-stacky locus of X (which is isomorphic via the natural map X \u2192 X \u2032 to the V\nin the proof of Lemma 3.1.2). It is a standard fact in the ramification theory of central simple algebras\nthat \u03b1|V is unramified, as V \u2192 X extracts an nth root of a generic uniformizer of each component\nof the ramification divisor (see e.g. Proposition 1.3 of [34]). Thus, there is an Azumaya algebra A \u25e6\non V representing \u03b1|V . Taking the reflexive hull and using the standard purity theorems on an \u00e9tale\ncover of X shows that A \u25e6 extends to an Azumaya algebra on all of X , as required. (In place of\n\u00e9tale cohomology, one could make the following alternative argument: proceeding as above, we end\nup with a sheaf of algebras A on X with the property that the natural map of locally free sheaves\nA \u2297 A \u25e6 \u2192 End(A ) is an isomorphism in codimension 1. Since X is regular, this map must be an\nisomorphism, which implies that A is Azumaya.)\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.1.4. Given X \u2192 T and \u03b1 as above, there is an An\u22121 -orbisurface, proper and flat over T ,\nadmitting a map X \u2192 X which is finite of generic degree n and such that \u03b1|K(X ) extends to a class in\nBr(X ).\n3.2. Splitting by root constructions. In this section, we assume that X is a connected regular\nexcellent scheme of dimension 2 and D \u2282 X is a divisor with simple normal crossings. Write U = X \\D.\nSuppose \u03b1 \u2208 Br(U ) is a Brauer class of period n with n * 1 \u2208 \u0393(X, OX )\u2217 . We assume that \u0393(X, OX )\ncontains a primitive nth root of unity \u03b6.\nWriting D = D1 + * * * + Dr as a sum of regular irreducible components, let X{D1/n } denote the stack\nX(D1 ,...,Dr ),(n,...,n) in the notation of Definition 2.2.4 of [4]. We have a natural morphism X{D1/n } \u2192 X\nwhich is an isomorphism over U and which is universal among morphisms for which the pullback of\neach Di is a the nth power of an effective Cartier divisor.\nProposition 3.2.1. There is a unique class \u03b1\ne \u2208 Br(X{D1/n }) whose restriction to U is \u03b1. Moreover, \u03b1\ne\nhas period n.\nProof. Uniqueness follows from the fact that the map Br(X{D1/n }) \u2192 Br(k(X)) is injective. To prove\nthat \u03b1 extends, we proceed as follows. First, it suffices to prove that it extends in the analogous\nsituation in which X = Spec R with R a dvr and D is the closed point of X. Indeed, it follows from purity\nthat the functor V 7\u2192 Br(V ) is a Zariski sheaf on X{D1/n }; if we achieve the result over dvrs, then we\nknow that \u03b1 extends over some open V \u2282 X{D1/n } containing the generic points of D. Invoking purity\nagain, we know that the restriction map Br(X{D1/n }) \u2192 Br(V ) is an isomorphism, establishing the\nresult. In less fancy language: given an Azumaya algebra A over V , its pushforward to X{D1/n } will\nbe reflexive, hence locally free (as X is a regular surface) and Azumaya in codimension 1, whence it is\nAzumaya since the degeneracy locus of the trace is of codimension 1 (and thus empty in this case).\n10\n\n\fSo we may suppose R is a dvr with uniformizer t and residue field \u03ba. The ramification of \u03b1 is given\nby some cyclic extension \u03ba(a1/n )\u03ba, where a \u2208 R\u00d7 is a unit. Letting (a, t)n denote the cyclic algebra\nof degree n, we see that the class \u03b1 \u2212 (a, t)n is unramified. Thus, to prove the result, it suffices to\nprove it for the algebra (a, t)n . Note that a local model for X{D1/n } is given by the stack quotient\n[Spec R[t1/n ]/\u03bcn ]. To show that (a, t)n extends to an unramified class over X{D1/n }, it thus suffices to\nfind a \u03bcn -equivariant Azumaya order in (a, t)n \u2297 K(R)(t1/n ).\nRecall that (a, t)n is generated by x and y such that xn = a, y n = t, and xy = \u03b6yx. We can choose new\ngenerators for (a, t)n \u2297 K(R)(t1/n ) by letting ye = y/t1/n . The R[t1/n ]-order generated by x and ye is then\nAzumaya (as its reduction modulo t1/n is the split central simple algebra (a, 1)n ), and has a \u03bcn -action\narising from the action on t1/n .\n\u0003\nThe reduced preimage of D in X{D1/n } is a residual curve of the type studied in Section 5 above.\nThus, \u03b1 gives rise to a Brauer class of period n on this residual curve. The moduli of uniform twisted\nsheaves on such a residual curve developed in Section 5.1 will give us information that can be deformed\noff of the ramification locus and back to the function field of X (in favorable circumstances).\n4. S OME\n\nCOHOMOLOGY\n\nIn this section, we gather together the cohomological computations which we will need throughout\nthe rest of the paper. This includes a study of the Brauer group and second cohomology of \u03bcn on the\nclassifying stack B\u03bcn as well as a discussion of the second cohomology of certain stacky surfaces which\nwill play a fundamental role starting in Section 3.\n4.1. Computation of Br(B\u03bcn )\u2032 .\nLemma 4.1.1. Let Y be a scheme such that Br(Y ) = H2 (Y, Gm )tors . The natural map\nBr(B\u03bcn,Y ) \u2192 H2 (B\u03bcn,Y , Gm )tors\nis an isomorphism.\nProof. The natural map Y \u2192 B\u03bcn,Y is finite locally free of degree n. Thus, an element \u03b1 \u2208 H2 (B\u03bcn,Y , Gm )\nlies in Br(B\u03bcn,Y ) if and only if \u03b1|Y lies in Br(Y ) (see e.g. 3.1.4.5 of [26]). But this is ensured by the\nhypothesis.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.1.2. The lemma notably holds when Y is the spectrum of a field. By Gabber's theorem [9],\nwe thus see that the Brauer group and cohomological Brauer group of B\u03bcn,Y coincide whenever Y is a\nquasi-compact separated scheme admitting an ample invertible sheaf.\nLemma 4.1.3. If L is separably closed and n is invertible in L then Br(B\u03bcn )\u2032 = 0.\nProof. In this case, L contains a primitive nth root of unity, so that it is enough to show Br(BZ/nZ) = 0.\nThus, it suffices to show that any Z/nZ-equivariant central simple L-algebra A of degree invertible in L\nis isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a Z/nZ-equivariant vector space V . Since L is separably\nclosed, the algebra underlying A is simply Mr (L) for some integer r invertible in L. By the SkolemNoether theorem, the generator of Z/nZ acts on Mr (L) via conjugation by some element \u03c6 \u2208 GLr (L)\nsuch that \u03c6n is a scalar \u03b3. Since n \u2208 L\u00d7 , there is some \u03b5 such that \u03b5n = \u03b3 \u22121 . Setting \u03c6\u2032 = \u03b5\u03c6 yields\nr\nan element of order n of GLr (L), i.e., a Z/nZ-equivariant structure on L , giving rise to the same\n\u0003\nequivariant structure on Mr (L). The result follows.\nProposition 4.1.4. Let L be a field. There is a split exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Br(L)\u2032 \u2192 Br(B\u03bcn )\u2032 \u2192 H1 (Spec L, Z/nZ) \u2192 0\ncompatible with base extension.\nProof. This comes from the Leray spectral sequence for the projection \u03c0 : B\u03bcn \u2192 L, using (1) R1 \u03c0\u2217 Gm =\nZ/nZ and (2) R2 \u03c0\u2217 Gm = 0. The first fact is simply the computation of the character group of \u03bcn , while\nthe second follows from Lemma 4.1.3 and Lemma 4.1.1. The splitting comes from the natural map\nSpec L \u2192 B\u03bcn .\n\u0003\n11\n\n\fCorollary 4.1.5. Let L be a field and suppose n \u2208 L\u00d7 . Suppose that there is a positive integer d such\nthat every \u03b1 \u2208 Br(L)[n] satisfies ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d . Then every \u03b2 \u2208 Br(B\u03bcn )[n] satisfies ind(\u03b2)| per(\u03b2)d+1 .\nProof. Suppose \u03b2 \u2208 Br(B\u03bcn ) has order m, where m is a positive divisor of n. Using , we can write\n\u03b2 = \u03b2 \u2032 + \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 with \u03b2 \u2032 in Br(L)[m] and \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 H1 (Spec L/Z/mZ) \u2282 H1 (Spec L, Z/nZ). By assumption, there\nis a field extension L\u2032 /L of degree md annihilating \u03b2 \u2032 . As there is clearly a finite \u00e9tale extension L\u2032\u2032 /L\nof degree m annihilating \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 , we conclude from the compatibility of Proposition 4.1 with field extension\n\u0003\nthere is a finite \u00e9tale morphism e : Spec L\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2192 Spec L of degree md+1 such that \u03b2|B\u03bcn \u2297L L\u2032\u2032\u2032 = 0.\n4.2. Computation of H2 (B\u03bcn , \u03bcn ).\nProposition 4.2.1. Let L be a field. The Kummer sequence and the natural covering Spec L \u2192 B\u03bcn\ngive rise to a canonical isomorphism\nH2 (B\u03bc , \u03bc ) \u223c\n= Z/nZ \u2295 Br(L)[n] \u2295 H1 (Spec L, \u03bc ) = Pic(B\u03bc ) \u2295 Br(B\u03bc )\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nin which projection to the first factor corresponds to base change to L and inclusion of the first factor\ncorresponds to the first Chern class map Pic(B\u03bcn ) \u2192 H2 (B\u03bcn , \u03bcn ). This isomorphism is compatible with\nbase extension.\nProof. This follows readily from Proposition 4.1.\n\n\u0003\n1\n\n2\n\nRemark 4.2.2. Let us make explicit the boundary map \u03b4 : H (B\u03bcn , PGLn ) \u2192 H (B\u03bcn , \u03bcn ) when the base\n\u223c\nfield is separably closed (and n is invertible). Fix an isomorphism Z/nZ \u2192 \u03bcn . The cohomology of B\u03bcn\nis then simply the group cohomology of Z/nZ. Given a homomorphism Z/nZ \u2192 PGLn (corresponding\nto a class [A ] \u2208 H1 (B\u03bcn , PGLn )), choose a lift \u03b1 of [1] to SLn (which is possible as L is separably closed).\nConcretely, given a Z/nZ-equivariant structure on Mn (L), choose a matrix A with An = 1 such that\nconjugation by A defines the action of [1] on Mn (L). Now, det A is an nth root of 1, say \u03b6. Setting \u03b1 equal\nto \u03b6 \u22121/n A yields a lift of [1] to SLn . We see that \u03b1n equals scalar multiplication by \u03b6, which is identified\nwith an element of Z/nZ via the chosen isomorphism. This element is precisely \u03b4([A ]).\n4.2.3. When n is prime and the base field contains a primitive nth root of unity, then we can\nexplicitly describe the image of the map\nH1 (B\u03bcn , PGLn )triv \u2192 H2 (B\u03bcn , \u03bcn ),\nwhere H1 (B\u03bcn , PGLn )triv consists of elements whose associated Brauer class is trivial when pulled back\nalong Spec L \u2192 B\u03bcn . (More generally, such a description is available for BZ/nZ rather than B\u03bcn .) In\norder to avoid confusion, we fix a prime l, invertible in L, and assume that L contains a primitive l-th\n\u223c\nroot of unity. Via a choice of primitive root, we get an isomorphism Z/lZ \u2192 \u03bcl , which we implicitly use\nin what follows.\nDefinition 4.2.4. Let L be a field. Given a Gm -gerbe \u03c0 : G \u2192 B\u03bcn,L , a locally free G -twisted sheaf\n\u223c\nW is regular if for some (and hence any) section \u03c4 : B\u03bcn \u2297 L \u2192 G \u2297 L of \u03c0 \u2297 L, the pullback \u03c4 \u2217 W is\nthe sheaf associated to the regular representation of \u03bcn . A locally free G -twisted sheaf W \u2032 is totally\nregular if it has the form W \u2295n for some regular locally free G -twisted sheaf W .\nA twisted sheaf on a \u03bcn -gerbe over B\u03bcn will be called regular if the pushforward to the associated\nGm -gerbe is regular.\nLemma 4.2.5. Suppose l is prime and invertible in L and \u03c0 : G \u2192 B\u03bcl is a non-trivial Gm -gerbe whose\npullback to Spec L by the natural map Spec L \u2192 B\u03bcl is trivial. If V is a G -twisted sheaf of rank l, then\nV is regular.\n\u223c\n\nProof. Fix an isomorphism Z/lZ \u2192 \u03bcl . Using this identification and the triviality of G |L , if we given\nV , the algebra \u03c0\u2217 : End(V ) is identified with a Z/lZ-equivariant structure on Ml (L), which is in turn\nidentified with an element of order l in PGLl . This can be lifted to a matrix A \u2208 GLl (L) such that\nAl = b for some scalar b \u2208 L\u00d7 with non-zero image in L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l . Extending scalars to L\u2032 := L(b1/l ), we\nsee that we can detect regularity by looking at the eigenspace decomposition of A\u2032 := b\u22121/l A: we have\nthat (A\u2032 )l = 1, so that (L\u2032 )l corresponds to a representation of \u03bcl . This is simply the pullback of V\n12\n\n\falong a section of G \u2192 B\u03bcl ; the different choices of the lth root of b correspond to the different choices\nof sections of the gerbe and have no effect on regularity, as they only permute the eigenspaces.\nBy elementary Galois theory, we know that the action of A on the vector space V = Ll has the\nproperty that V \u2297 Lsep breaks up as a direct sum of distinct one-dimensional eigenspaces for the action\nof A \u2297 Lsep . But these are the same as the eigenspaces for A\u2032 \u2297L\u2032 Lsep . This implies that (L\u2032 )l is the\nregular representation of \u03bcl , as desired.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.2.6. Suppose L is finite. Let G \u2192 B\u03bcl be a \u03bcl -gerbe with cohomology class (a, 0, \u03b2 6= 0).\nAny two G -twisted sheaves of rank l are isomorphic.\nProof. Let V1 and V2 be two such sheaves. By Lemma 4.2.5, both V1 and V2 are regular, so that the\nscheme Isom(V1 , V2 ) is a torsor under a torus. By Lang's theorem, it has a rational point.\n\u0003\nProposition 4.2.7. Let A be an Azumaya algebra of degree l over B\u03bcl . Suppose that the Brauer class\nof A is non-trivial but that A |Spec L = 0. Via the isomorphism of Proposition 4.2.1, the class of A in\nH2 (B\u03bcl , \u03bcl ) has the form\n(1) (1, 0, \u03b1) for some \u03b1 6= 0 if l = 2;\n(2) (0, 0, \u03b1) for some \u03b1 6= 0 if l is odd.\nThus, given a \u03bcl -gerbe Y \u2192 B\u03bcl with cohomology class (a, 0, \u03b2 6= 0), every locally free Y -twisted sheaf\nof rank l has determinant a \u2212 \u03b42l \u2208 Z/lZ, where \u03b4 is the Kr\u00f6necker delta function.\nProof. Let G \u2192 B\u03bcn be the Gm -gerbe of trivializations of A . We have that A |G = End(V ) for some\nlocally free G -twisted sheaf of rank l. By Lemma 4.2.5, we know that V is regular. If we represent A\nby an element A of order l in PGLl , then the regularity implies that any lift A of A in GLl \u2297 Lsep such\nthat Al = 1 gives the regular representation of Z/lZ on (Lsep )l , and thus has trivial determinant if l is\nodd, or determinant [1] if l = 2.\n\u0003\n4.3. The Brauer group of B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) and Saltman's meteorology. In this section, we compute the\nBrauer group of the classifying stack B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) and compare the results to Saltman's recent \"meteorology\" of crossings point in the ramification divisor of Brauer classes on surfaces [33].\nLet L be a field containing a chosen primitive lth root of unity; we will use this to identify \u03bcl with\nZ/lZ in what follows (although we will keep the notation canonical). Write Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) for the\nkernel of the natural map Br(B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) \u2192 Br(L) induced by pullback to the point u : Spec L \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7\n\u223c\n\u03bcl ). The structural morphism of B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) and the point u induce a natural splitting Br(B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) \u2192\nBr(L) \u2295 Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )).\nLemma 4.3.1. The group Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) classifies group scheme extensions\n1 \u2192 Gm \u2192 G \u2192 \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 1.\nIn particular, the functor sending the listed extension to the 1-morphism BG \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) together with\nthe inertial trivialization Gm \u2192 I (BG/ B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) defines a a bijection between the set of isomorphism\nclasses of extensions and the set of isomorphism classes of Gm -gerbes with Brauer classes in Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7\n\u03bcl )).\nProof. It is standard that the morphism BG \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) is a Gm -gerbe. Pulling back the associated\nBrauer class to L is equivalent to pulling back the group extension along the map B1 \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ),\nwhere 1 is the singleton group scheme. But this pullback is just Gm , resulting in the trivial Gm -gerbe\nBGm over L. Thus, the gerbe BG \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) has Brauer class in Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ), as claimed.\nOn the other hand, if G \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) is a Gm -gerbe representing a class in Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )), then we\nknow that (1) G \u2192 Spec L is a gerbe (as it is a composition of gerbes), and (2) there is a map Spec L \u2192 G\nover L. Thus, G \u223c\n= BG for some group scheme G of finite type over L. Moreover, since G is a Gm -gerbe\nover B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ), we get a natural expression of G as an extension\n1 \u2192 Gm \u2192 G \u2192 \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 1\n\u223c\n\n(using the inertial trivialization Gm \u2192 I (G )).\n13\n\n\fTo see that the extensions in question are central, note that we can identify sheaves on G with\nrepresentations of G. In particular, a locally free G -twisted sheaf of (positive) rank N yields a morphism\nof sequences\n/1\n/ Gm\n/G\n/ \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl\n1\nid\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\u000f\n/ GLN\n/ PGLN\n/ 1.\n/ Gm\n1\nTensoring any locally free G -twisted sheaf of positive rank with the pullback of the sheaf on B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )\ncorresponding to the regular representation of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl , we can find such a diagram in which the right\nvertical arrow is injective. (This corresponds to tensoring a \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl -equivariant Azumaya algebra\nwith the sheaf of endomorphisms of the regular representation, which is it self a power of the regular\nrepresentation and thus faithful.) It follows that the middle vertical arrow is injective and then that\nthe extension is central.\n\u0003\n\u223c\n\nUsing the isomorphism \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 Z/lZ \u00d7 Z/lZ determined by the chosen primitive lth root of unity,\na projective representation \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 PGLN is determined by two elements X and Y in GLN (L) such\nthat X l \u2208 L\u00d7 , Y l \u2208 L\u00d7 and [X, Y ] = \u03b3 \u2208 \u03bcl (L). Since X and Y are determined up to elements of\nGm (L), the triple (X l , Y l , \u03b3) yields an element of L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l \u00d7 L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l \u00d7 \u03bcl , and it is clear that this is\nan invariant of the isomorphim class of the underlying extension 1 \u2192 Gm \u2192 G \u2192 \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 1, yielding\na set-theoretic morphism\ni : Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) \u2192 (L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l )\u00d72 \u00d7 \u03bcl (L).\nProposition 4.3.2. The map i is an isomorphism of abelian groups.\nProof. We first show that i is a map of groups. Recall that the group law on Br0 is induced by tensor\nproduct of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl -equivariant matrix algebras. Given two actions \u03c61 , \u03c62 of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl on MN1 (L) and\nMN2 (L), we compute the sum in Br0 by taking the tensor product representation MN1 (L) \u2297 MN2 (L).\nThe elements X and Y then act diagonally, and we easily see that i(\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62 ) = i(\u03c61 )i(\u03c62 ), as desired.\nWe now claim that i is surjective. Let (A, B, \u03b3) be a triple. Consider the (possibly commutative!)\nL-algebra (A, B)\u03b3 with generators x and y subject to the relations xl = A, y l = B, and xy = \u03b3yx. The\nelements x and y are units, and their action on (A, B)\u03b3 by conjugation gives a projective representation \u03c6 of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl (by looking at the induced action on the endomorphism algebra of the vector space\nunderlying (A, B)\u03b3 ) such that i(\u03c6) = (A, B, \u03b3).\nFinally, we claim that i is injective. Suppose given an action of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl on MN (L) whose invariants\nare (1, 1, 1), we get commuting elements X, Y \u2208 GLN (L) such that X l = id and Y l = id. This gives\na representation \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 GLN whose image in PGLN is the given action, which shows that the\nequivariant matrix algebra is the endomorphisms of an equivariant vector space, thus trivializing the\nBrauer class.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.3.3. Every class in Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) has period l.\n4.3.4. Of utmost importance will be various indices of the classes in Br0 . The natural point Spec L \u2192\nB\u03bcl yields two maps ri : B\u03bcl \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ), i = 1, 2, which we will call the restriction maps. Throughout\nthis section, we fix a Gm -gerbe G \u2192 B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) in Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) with invariant i(G ) = (A, B, \u03b3). We\nwill abusively write ri : GB\u03bcl \u2192 G for the map induced by ri ; these maps pull back twisted sheaves to\ntwisted sheaves.\nDefinition 4.3.5. A G -twisted sheaf V is totally biregular if ri\u2217 V is totally regular for i = 1, 2.\nDefinition 4.3.6. The minimal rank of a non-zero totally biregular G -twisted sheaf will be called the\nglobal index.\nProposition 4.3.7. Suppose the field L is finite.\n(1) If \u03b3 6= 1 then both the index and global index of G are l.\n(2) If \u03b3 = 1 but A 6= 1 and B 6= 1 then both the index and global index of G are l.\n(3) If \u03b3 = 1 and A = 1 but B 6= 1, then the index of G is l, while the global index of G is l2 .\n14\n\n\fProof. For the first statement, note that since \u03b3 6= 0, the cyclic algebra (A, B)\u03b3 is a central simple\n\u223c\nalgebra of index l. Since L is finite, there is an isomorphism (A, B)\u03b3 \u2192 Ml (L), thus yielding a projective\nrepresentation \u03c6 : \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl \u2192 PGLl with i(\u03c6) = (A, B, \u03b3). This shows that the index is l; in fact, it\nrealizes the given \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl -action on Ml (L) as the endomorphisms of some G -twisted sheaf V of rank l.\nMoreover, the restriction of the Brauer class via the ri is given by restricting \u03c6 to each factor \u03bcl . To see\nthat the sheaf V is totally biregular, we can use the explicit description of (A, B)\u03b3 as follows. Extending\n\u223c\nscalars to L and replacing x by x/A1/l and y by y/B 1/l yields an isomorphism (A, B)\u03b3 \u2297 L \u2192 (1, 1)\u03b3 \u2297 L\nof \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl -equivariant L-algebras which have the same projective representation. On the other hand,\nwe can realize (1, 1)\u03b3 explicitly using the elements\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0 ***\n0\n\uf8ec0 \u03b3 * * *\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nX = \uf8ec. . .\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n\uf8ed .. ..\n. \uf8f8\nl\u22121\n0 0 *** \u03b3\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 0\n\uf8ec1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nY = \uf8ec0 1\n\uf8ec .. ..\n\uf8ed. .\n0 0\n\n***\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n***\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n.\uf8f8\n0\n\nfrom which it is obvious that each of X and Y acts on L as the regular representation of \u03bcl . This\nshows that the twisted sheaf V is totally biregular, as desired.\nTo prove the second statement, note that since both A and B are non-zero, they generate L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l \u223c\n=\nZ/lZ, so that there is some n relatively prime to l with Am = B \u2208 L\u00d7 /(L\u00d7 )l . Consider the field\nextension L\u2032 := L[x]/(xl \u2212 A). Scalar multiplication by x and by xn yield an L-linear action on L\u2032\ncorresponding to a map G \u2192 GLl ; the image in PGLl will be a projective representation with invariant\n(A, B, 1). To check biregularity we can again work over L and replace x by X/A1/l , whence we see that\nthe resulting map \u03bcl \u2192 GLl is now the regular representation. Thus, the global index is l, and this\nimplies that the index is l.\nTo see the last statement, note that the algebra L[x, y]/(xl \u2212 1, y l \u2212 B) admits an action as in the\nprevious paragraph, yielding a G -twisted sheaf of rank l2 that is totally biregular. On the other hand,\nsince the action of the first factor lifts to an element of GLl2 , the restriction of G via r1 is trivial; since\nB\u03bcl \u2192 B\u03bcl \u00d7 B\u03bcl has degree l, this shows that G has index l. If the global index were l, there would\nbe a pair of commuting elements X and Y in GLl (L) such that X l = 1 and Y l = B. By the double\ncentralizer theorem (applied to the subalgebra generated by Y ), X would have to lie in the subalgebra\nof Ml (L) generated by Y (i.e., this algebra is its own centralizer). But the only lth roots of unity in this\nsubalgebra are those in L, which means that the action of X is not (geometrically) conjugate to the\nregular representation.\n\u0003\nl\n\nCorollary 4.3.8. Suppose the triple of G is (A, B, 1). Then there is a locally free G -twisted sheaf V of\nrank l2 such that for any invertible G \u2297 L-twisted sheaf \u039b, the sheaf VL \u2297 \u039b\u2228 is the sheaf on B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )\nassociated to the regular representation of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl .\nProof. Since \u03b3 = 1, we see that the cohomology class of G has the form pr\u22171 \u03b1+ pr\u22172 \u03b2, where \u03b1 is the class\nin Br(B\u03bcl ) associated to A and \u03b2 is the class associated to B. Letting W1 be a regular \u03b1-twisted sheaf\nand W2 a regular \u03b2-twisted sheaf, we see that pr\u22171 W1 \u2297 pr\u22172 W2 is a G -twisted sheaf with the requisite\nproperties.\n\u0003\n4.3.9. The reader familiar with [33] might notice a resemblance between Proposition 4.3.7 and\nSaltman's \"meteorology\" of points on ramification divisors for Brauer classes on surfaces. In this paragraph we will explain the connection (at least in the special case in which we have proved it; it is easy\nto extend the method above to the general case and achieve total parity with Saltman's setup). We will\nbe content to simply sketch the correspondence, as it is a digression from our primary purpose here.\n15\n\n\fLet us briefly remind the reader of Saltman's terminology. Suppose R is a regular local ring of\ndimension 2 with residue field \u03ba, and suppose s and t are generators of the maximal ideal of R. For any\ndomain B arising in the following, we will write K(B) for its fraction field.\nGiven a Brauer class \u03b1 over K of period l invertible in R which is ramified only over the (transversely\nintersecting) divisors cut out by s and t, the ramification theory of Brauer classes (reviewed in Section\n3 below) produces two ramification extensions L1 /K(R/sR) and L2 /K(R/tR) of degree l which have\nthe same order of ramification over the closed point Spec \u03ba lying in both Spec R/sR and Spec R/tR.\nThere are three possibilities for the configuration of L1 and L2 (up to the symmetry of s and t in the\nnotation):\n(1) both L1 and L2 ramify over Spec \u03ba;\n(2) both L1 and L2 are unramified over Spec \u03ba and are non-trivial;\n(3) L1 is trivial and L2 is non-trivial and unramified over Spec \u03ba.\nIn Saltman's terminology, the first case is called \"cold,\" the second case is called \"chilly\", and the third\nis called \"hot\".\nTo connect this with the Brauer group of B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ), we give a preview of results which will be fully\nexplained in Section 3. (The reader may find it easier to read this after reading that section.) Let\nX \u2192 Spec R be the stack arising by taking the lth roots of the divisors Spec R/sR and Spec R/tR in\nSpec R (see Section 3.2 for definitions). By 3.2.1, the class \u03b1 extends to a class in Br(X ). In fact, we\nhave an isomorphism between Br(Spec R \\ (Spec R/sR \u222a Spec R/tR))[l] and Br(X )[l]. Now X contains\nB(\u03bcl \u00d7\u03bcl ) as a closed substack (the reduced stack structure on the preimage of Spec \u03ba under the natural\n\u223c\nmap X \u2192 Spec R). Reduction defines a morphism Br(X )[l] \u2192 Br(B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ))[l]; when the residue field\n\u03ba is finite, this finally results in a morphism\n\u223c\n\nBr(Spec R \\ (Spec R/sR \u222a Spec R/tR))[l] \u2192 Br(X )[l] \u2192 Br(B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )) = Br0 (B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl )).\nIf R is complete, the composition is in fact an isomorphism and Br(X ) is itself l-torsion (so the left side\nbecomes Br(X )).\nVia this map, the three ramification situations described above (cold, chilly, and hot) correspond\nprecisely to the three types of Brauer classes described in Proposition 4.3.7. It is interesting to note\nthat ramification information for classes over the complicated field K gets translated into information\nabout Brauer classes over the classifying stack B(\u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl ) that only sees the finite residue field. The\ntechniques explained here are a demonstration that the geometry of stacks makes this connection less\nsilly than it might at first seem, as one can import flexible global geometric methods into ramified\nsituations.\n5. R ESIDUAL\n\nCURVES AND MODULI OF UNIFORM TWISTED SHEAVES\n\nLet k be a field. Fix an odd prime l.\nDefinition 5.1. A stack C \u2192 k is a residual curve if\n(1) C is a connected tame Deligne-Mumford stack of dimension 1 whose coarse moduli space space\nC is a simple normal crossing curve;\n(2) if C1 , . . . , Cr are the (smooth) irreducible components of C, then there are Zariski-locally trivial\n\u03bcl -gerbes Ci\u2032 \u2192 Ci such that C = C1\u2032 \u00d7C C2\u2032 \u00d7C * * * \u00d7C Cr\u2032 .\nThe curves Ci := C \u00d7C Ci are then smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks of dimension 1 with generic\nstabilizer \u03bcl and a finite closed substack over which the stabilizer is \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl . We will write Ci\u25e6 for\nCi \\ \u222aj6=i Cj ; it is the intersection of the smooth locus of C with Ci and is a \u03bcl -gerbe over a the dense\nopen subscheme Ci \u2229 C sm \u2282 Ci .\nThe way such curves usually arise is as the stacky loci of the root construction [4] applied to a\nsimple normal crossing divisor in a smooth surface, or to a simple normal crossing divisor in a fiber\nof an arithmetic surface. That is certainly how they will arise for us. In this section we fix a residual\ncurve C , with irreducible components C1 , . . . , Cr . Write \u03bai for \u0393(Ci , OCi ); we thus have that Ci is a\ngeometrically integral smooth curve over \u03bai .\nFix a \u03bcl -gerbe G \u2192 C . Write Gi := G \u00d7C Ci . We will write \u03c0 for the natural map G \u2192 C and, by\nabuse of notation, for the natural map Gi \u2192 Ci . Finally, we will write Gi\u25e6 for G \u00d7C Ci\u25e6 .\n16\n\n\fWe assume that for each geometric point c \u2192 C sm , the restriction G \u2297 \u03ba(c) is trivial in H2 (C \u2297 \u03ba(c), \u03bcl ).\nThe following lemma shows that this is a harmless assumption if one is concerned only with the Brauer\nclass of [G ].\nLemma 5.2. Given a class \u03b1 \u2208 Br(C )[l], there is a \u03bcl -gerbe G \u2192 C such that for every geometric point\nc \u2192 C the restriction G |C \u2297 \u03ba(c) has trivial class in H2 (C \u2297 \u03ba(c), \u03bcl ).\nProof. Given any collection of characters \u03c7tii of the generic geometric stabilizers B\u03bcl on Ci\u25e6 , there is\nan invertible sheaf L on C such that for any geometric residual gerbe x : B\u03bcl,\u03ba \u2192 Ci\u25e6 the character\nassociated to x\u2217 L is \u03c7tii . Indeed, the existence of an invertible sheaf L\u2032i on Ci\u25e6 with character \u03c7ji i\nfollows from the assumption that Ci\u25e6 \u2192 Ci\u25e6 isPa Zariski-locally trivial \u03bcl -gerbe. A local calculation then\nshows that the invertible sheaf Li := L\u2032i (\u2212 j6=i tj Cj \u2229 Ci ) has the property that at a residual gerbe\nt\n\n\u03be = B\u03bcl \u00d7 B\u03bcl \u0592\u2192 Ci \u2229 Cj , we have Li |\u03be as character \u03c7tii \u2297 \u03c7jj . Gluing the Li together yields L, as\ndesired.\nNow let ci \u2192 Ci\u25e6 be a set of geometric points, and let the image of G \u2297 \u03ba(ci ) be ni \u2208 H2 (Ci \u2297 \u03ba(c), \u03bcl ).\nLet L be the invertible sheaf as in the previous paragraph with characters \u03c7ni i . Replacing G by a\n\u03bcl -gerbe representing the class [G ] \u2212 [L]1/l (where [L]1/l denotes the image of L via the Kummer map\nH1 (C , Gm ) \u2192 H2 (C , \u03bcl )) yields a gerbe G \u2032 with the same Brauer class and whose cohomology class\nvanishes at all geometric points in C sm , as desired..\n\u0003\nIn this section, we will describe certain stacks of G -twisted sheaves.\n\nDefinition 5.3. Given an element a \u2208 Z/lZ, a sheaf F on Ci\u25e6 will be called isotypic of type a if the\ngeometric generic fiber F \u2297 \u03ba(Ci ) has the form (\u03c7a )\u2295N for some N as sheaves on B\u03bcl,\u03ba(Ci ) , where\n\u03c7 : \u03bcl \u2192 Gm is the natural inclusion character.\nDefinition 5.4. Given a locally free Gi -twisted sheaf V , an eigendecomposition of V is a direct decomposition V = V0 \u2295 V1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vl\u22121 such that for all s and t, the sheaf \u03c0\u2217 H om(Vs , Vt )|Ci\u25e6 is isotypic of type\n[t \u2212 s].\nLemma 5.5. Let V be a locally free Gi -twisted sheaf. Choose an algebraic closure k of k.\n(1) There is at most one eigendecomposition of V \u2297 k, up to isomorphism.\n(2) If V \u2297 k admits an eigendecomposition, then the set of numbers {deg H om(Vs , Vt )} is independent of the choice of k and of eigendecomposition over k.\nProof. We may assume k = k. Suppose V = V0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vl\u22121 = W0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Wl\u22121 are two eigendecompositions of V . Write K for an algebraic closure of the function field of Ci . Let M be an invertible\nG \u2297 K-twisted sheaf. LRestricting the\nLtwo decompositions to the geometric generic point yields two\neigendecompositions (Vi \u2297 M \u2228 ) = (Wi \u2297 M \u2228 ) of the K-linear \u03bcl -representation V \u2297 K. It follows\nfrom the standard representation theory of \u03bcl that there is a (cyclic) permutation i 7\u2192 j(i) such that\nVi \u2297 K = Wj(i) \u2297 K. Re-indexing, we may assume that j(i) = i. We conclude by faithful flatness that\nVi \u2297 K = Wi \u2297 K as subsheaves of V \u2297 K.\nNow consider\nthe quotient V \u2192 Vi . For j 6= i, the fact that Vj \u2297 K = Wj \u2297 K implies that the natural\nL\nsurjection\nWi \u0589 Vi factors through a surjection Wi \u0589 Vi . Since Wi and Vi are of finite rank, it\nfollows that this surjection is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\nThe set of degrees {deg H om(Vs , Vt )} will be denoted d(V ). The set d(V ) always contains 0 and is\nsymmetric with respect to negation. Similarly, the set r(V ) := {rk H om(Vs , Vt )} is independent of the\ngeometric eigendecomposition.\nDefinition 5.6. A locally free G -twisted sheaf V is uniform of determinant O if\n(1) det V \u223c\n= O;\n(2) for all i, if V |Gi admits a geometric eigendecomposition then d(V ) = {0} and r(V ) is a singleton.\nIn particular, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 5.7. If V is a uniform G -twisted sheaf of rank l2 then\n17\n\n\f(1) for every residual gerbe \u03be : B\u03bcl,\u03ba \u0592\u2192 C \u25e6 in the smooth locus of C , the restriction V |\u03be is totally\nregular;\n(2) for each residual gerbe \u03be \u2032 of C of the form B\u03bcl \u00d7 B\u03bcl , the restriction V |\u03be\u2032 is totally biregular.\nProof. It suffices to prove this after passing to an algebraically closed base field, so we may assume\nthat \u03ba is algebraically closed and therefore that V |\u03be has an eigendecomposition V |\u03be = V0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vl\u22121 .\nChoosing an invertible G |\u03be -twisted sheaf L, the sheaf V |\u03be \u2297 L\u2228 is thus identified with a representation\nW of \u03bcl admitting a direct sum decomposition W = W0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Wl\u22121 such that H om(Ws , Wt ) is of\nconstant rank and is isotypic of weight t \u2212 s for all s and t. It follows that each Wi is isotypic of a fixed\nrank r, from which it follows that V |\u03be \u223c\n= \u03c1\u2295r , giving the first statement. The second statement follows\nfrom the first: the two factors of the inertia stack \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl of \u03be \u2032 are limits of the inertia stacks \u03bcl on\nthe two branches of C meeting at \u03be \u2032 . Since restriction to a factor corresponds to deformation into the\nsmooth locus of the corresponding branch, we see that total biregularity implies total regularity on the\nbranches.\n\u0003\n5.1. Moduli of uniform twisted sheaves. Write \u03be1 , . . . , \u03bem for the set of singular residual gerbes of\nC ; thus, each \u03bei is isomorphic to B\u03bcl \u00d7 B\u03bcl . Write G (i) for the restriction of G to \u03bei . By Corollary 4.3.8,\nfor each i there is a totally biregular G (i)-twisted sheaf V (i) which is geometrically isomorphic to a\ntwist of the regular representation of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl . We fix such a choice for each i = 1, . . . , m in this section.\nDefinition 5.1.1. Let U denote the k-stack whose objects over T \u2192 Spec k are locally free GT -twisted\n\u223c\nsheaves V of rank l2 together with an isomorphism det V \u2192 O such that for each geometric point\nt \u2192 T,\n(1) the fiber Vt is uniform as a Gt -twisted sheaf;\n(2) for each i, the restriction of V to (\u03bei )t is isomorphic to V (i)t .\nThe primary goal of this section is to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.1.2. The stack U is a smooth Artin stack over k with quasi-affine stabilizers. If l is odd, U\nis geometrically connected.\nThe primary use of the theorem in this paper will be the following corollary.\nCorollary 5.1.3. Suppose l is odd. If C is a residual curve over a finite field L and G \u2192 C is a \u03bcl -gerbe,\nthen for some N > 1 relatively prime to l, there is a locally free G -twisted sheaf of rank N l2 and trivial\ndeterminant.\nProof. Since U is integral with quasi-affine stabilizers, there is a dense open substack V \u2282 U of the\nform [P/ GLn ] with P an algebraic space (Proposition 3.5.9 of [20]). Since U is geometrically integral,\nso is V and thus P . By the Lang-Weil estimates, P has a point over an extension L/k of degree prime\nto l. Taking the image of this point in U yields a locally free G \u2297k L-twisted sheaf of rank l2 and trivial\ndeterminant. The proof follows from the following Lemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.1.4. Let X be a proper stack over a field k and L/k a finite \u00e9tale algebra of degree d. Write\n\u03c0 : X \u2297 L \u2192 X for the natural projection. If V is a locally free sheaf of rank r on X \u2297 L of determinant\nO then \u03c0\u2217 V is locally free on X of rank r and determinant O.\nProof. To check that the determinant is trivial, it suffices to work over k (as X is proper), and thus we\ne\nmay assume\nSpec k = \u222api is a finite product of copies of k. Now \u03c0\u2217 V = \u2295V |pi , so that\nN that Spec L = \u2294i=1\n\u0003\ndet \u03c0\u2217 V =\ndet V |pi . If det V \u223c\n= O, giving the result.\n= O, then for each i we have det V |pi \u223c\n\n5.1.5. Before proving Theorem 5.1.2, we first describe a geometric avatar of the ramification exten(1)\nsions. Consider the stack Pi := PicG \u25e6 /C \u25e6 parametrizing Ci\u25e6 -flat families of Gi\u25e6 -twisted sheaves on Ci\u25e6 .\ni\ni\nStandard methods show that Pi \u2192 Ci\u25e6 is a Gm -gerbe over a Ri \u2192 Ci\u25e6 .\nProposition 5.1.6. With the preceding notation, there is a cyclic \u00e9tale covering Ri \u2192 Ci\u25e6 such that Pi\nis a Gm -gerbe over Ri .\nIntrinsically, Ri is the rigidification of Pi with respect to Gm , in the notation of [1].\n18\n\n\fProof. It is standard that Pi is a Gm -gerbe over an algebraic space Ri . Moreover, elementary deformation theory shows that Pi \u2192 Ci\u25e6 is smooth, so that Ri \u2192 Ci\u25e6 is also smooth. On the other hand,\nthe relative Picard stack of Ci\u25e6 over Ci\u25e6 is a Gm -gerbe over the constant group scheme Z/lZ. Tensoring\ndefines an action Z/lZ \u00d7 Ri \u2192 Ri over Ci\u25e6 which is simply transitive on geometric fibers. We conclude\nthat Ri \u2192 Ci\u25e6 is naturally a Z/lZ-torsor, as desired.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.1.7. It is not too difficult to see that Ri is precisely the ramification extension of \u03b1 at Ci . The\neasiest proof goes by noting that they split one another.\nThere is an elementary criterion for the existence of an eigendecomposition.\nProposition 5.1.8. Given a field extension L/\u03bai , a non-zero locally free Gi -twisted sheaf V has an\neigendecomposition if and only if Ri \u2297\u03bai L is disconnected.\nProof. It suffices to assume \u03bai = L and to work at the generic point Spec K of Ci . We first claim that\nthere exists a V with an eigendecomposition if and only if the Brauer class of G is pulled back from\nSpec K.\nTo see this, suppose V = V0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vl\u22121 is an eigendecomposition. Then H om(V0 , V0 ) is an Azumaya\nalgebra on B\u03bcl,K with the same Brauer class as G and on which \u03bcl acts trivially. It follows that the\nBrauer class of G is pulled back from Spec K. On the other hand, if the class is a pullback, then let A\nbe an Azumaya algebra over Spec K representing [G ]. The category of G -twisted sheaves is naturally\nequivalent to the category of \u03bcl -equivariant right A-modules. But the representation theory of \u03bcl on\nvector spaces over a division ring is the same as that of a field, so we see that any module admits an\neigendecomposition.\nThus, to prove the Proposition it suffices to prove that Ri is split if and only if [G ] is pulled back\nfrom Spec K. Suppose Ri is split, and let s : Spec K \u2192 Ri be any section. By definition, the obstruction\nto lifting s to an invertible G -twisted sheaf vanishes if and only if [G ] vanishes. This obstruction\nis thus (at the very least) an element of Br(K) whose pullback under the injective map Br(K) \u0592\u2192\nBr(B\u03bcl,K ) generates the same cyclic subgroup as [G ]. It follows that [G ] is a pullback. Conversely,\nassume that G is a pullback from K, say G = G \u00d7Spec K B\u03bcl,K . The Gm -gerbe associated to G over\nSpec K is naturally isomorphic to the relative twisted Picard stack of G over K, so that PicG / Spec K =\nSpec K. Given a K-scheme T , it is easy to see any GT -twisted sheaf L has the form L \u2297 \u039b with L an\ninvertible G T -twisted sheaf and \u039b an invertible sheaf on B\u03bcl,T . This shows that the natural map\nPicB\u03bcl / Spec K \u00d7 PicG / Spec K \u2192 PicG / Spec K is an isomorphism, which shows that Ri is split, as desired.\n\u0003\n5.1.9. We now prove Theorem 5.1.2. Since the statement is geometric, it suffices to work over the\nalgebraic closure of the base field. Thus, we will assume that the base field k is algebraically closed for\nthe rest of this section. Without loss of generality, we may assume that i = 1, . . . , s are the indices such\nthat the coverings Ri \u2192 Ci\u25e6 are split. For each i = 1, . . . , s, we fix an invertible Gi -twisted sheaf \u039bi .\nThe idea of the proof is the following. Basic deformation theory shows that U is smooth, so it suffices\nto show that it is connected. Let V and W be two objects of U over k. A general map V \u2192 W (n) has\nas cokernel Q an invertible twisted sheaf supported on a finite \u00e9tale subscheme of C \u25e6 . The uniformity\nconditions ensure that Q moves in an irreducible family I. The vector bundle over I parametrizing\nextensions of Q by V then surjects onto U , showing that it is connected. Of course, this outline is\nhopelessly na\u00efve, but there is a version of it that works, which we now describe.\nDefinition 5.1.10. Let C \u2192 G be a finite flat covering by a scheme. The C-regularity of a G -twisted\nsheaf F is the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of F |C with respect to the polarization pulled back\nfrom C.\nLemma 5.1.11. Given a positive integer N , there is a quasi-compact open substack UN \u2282 U parametrizing uniform locally free G -twisted sheaves of C-regularity at most N . Moreover, the natural inclusion\n\u222aN UN \u0592\u2192 U is an isomorphism.\nProof. By Proposition 3.2.2 of [25], the pullback morphism U \u2192 Sh(C) is of finite presentation, where\nSh(C) denotes the stack of flat families of locally free sheaves on C. On the other hand, we know\n19\n\n\fthat the open substack of Sh(C) parametrizing sheaves of regularity at most N is quasi-compact. We\nconclude that UN is quasi-compact, as desired.\n\u0003\nSince U is the union of the quasi-compact open substacks UN , it suffices to prove that each UN is\nconnected. Thus, in what follows we will fix N and write U in place of UN .\nProposition 5.1.12. There exists a positive integer n such that for any two objects V and W in Uspeck ,\na general map V \u2192 W (n) has cokernel Q satisfying the following conditions.\n(1) The support S := Supp Q is a finite reduced substack of G \u25e6 and Q is identified with a GS -twisted\ninvertible sheaf.\n(2) For any i we have |S \u2229 Ci | = l2 nH * Ci .\n`\n`\n(3) For i = 1, . . . , s, there is a partition S\u2229Ci = S0 * * * Sl\u22121 such that (1) for each j, |Sj | = lnH*Ci ,\nand (2) Q|Sj \u223c\n= \u039b S j \u2297 \u03c7j .\nIn other words, the cokernel of a general map of uniform sheaves is itself \"uniformly distributed\"\nwith respect to the characters of \u03bcl .\nProof. Using methods similar to those of Lemma 3.1.4.8ff of [24], for any n we have an exact sequence\nof sets\nQ\n/Q\n/\n(1)\nHom(V, W (n))\n/ j Hom(V |\u03bej , W (n)|\u03bej ).\ni Hom(V |Ci , W (n)|Ci )\nQ\nFor n sufficiently large, we have that the composition Hom(V, W (n)) \u2192\nHom(V |\u03be , W (n)|\u03be ) and the\n\u223c\nprojections Hom(V, W (n)) \u2192 Hom(V |Ci , W (n)|Ci ) are surjective. Fixing identifications V |\u03bej \u2192 V (j) and\n\u223c\nW |\u03bej \u2192 V (j), we may consider only those maps V \u2192 W (n) and V |Ci \u2192 W (n)|Ci which induce the\nidentity on V (j) for each j; these form linear subspaces which we will denote H and Hi , respectively.\nFor sufficiently large n, the natural maps H \u2192 Hi are surjective.\nWe first claim that it suffices to prove the statement for the restrictions Vi and W (n)i to Ci . If this\nstatement is proven for each i then we can use Diagram (1) to glue such maps together. Since the\nconditions are clearly open, this will show that a general map V \u2192 W (n) has this property. Thus, we\nwill restrict our attention to Ci in what follows.\nIf i = 1, . . . , s, then V and W have eigendecompositions, and maps between V and W (n) must\npreserve the eigensheaves, each of which has rank l. Thus, to show the result we may assume that\nfor i = 1, . . . , s the sheaves V and W are generically isomorphic eigensheaves of degree 0 and rank l.\nj\nSuppose that \u039b\u2228\ni \u2297 W is isotyptic of type \u03c7 . Then any simple quotient of W (n) supported on a reduced\n\u25e6\nresidual gerbe x in Ci will be of the form (\u039bi )x \u2297 \u03c7j , and we see that to prove the result it suffices to\nprove that a general map between V and W (n) which induces an isomorphism at each \u03bej has cokernel\nwhich is an invertible twisted sheaf supported on a finite reduced subscheme of Ci\u25e6 .\nTwisting down by \u039bi \u2297 \u03c7j , we reduce to proving the following statement. Let C be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field and let D \u2282 C be a reduced effective Cartier divisor. Given\ntwo locally free sheaves V and W of rank l on the root stack C{D1/l } such that det V \u223c\n= OC\n= det W \u223c\n\u223c\nand VD = WD , a general map V \u2192 W (n) with prescribed value over D has cokernel an invertible sheaf\nsupported on a finite reduced subscheme of C \\ D.\nLet \u03a6 : V |H \u2192 W (n)H be the universal map on C \u00d7 H. We are interested in the locus over H over\nwhich coker \u03a6 is smooth over C with fibers of rank \u2264 1. This is clearly an open condition on H, and the\ncomplement of this locus forms a cone B. We will investigate the fiber dimension of this cone over C.\nGiven a point c \u2208 C \u25e6 , we have that the restriction map\nH \u2192 Hom(VSpec(OC/c /m2c ) , W (n)Spec(OC/c /m2c ) ) = Ml (OC,c /m2c )\nis surjective. Writing a matrix as A + \u03b5B, we have by the Jacobi formula that\ndet(A + \u03b5B) = det A + \u03b5 Tr(adj(A)B),\nwhere adj denotes the classical adjoint (arising from cofactor matrices). The vanishing of this expression is clearly of codimension at least 3, so the fiber of B over c is of codimension at least 3 in H.\nThis shows that B has codimension at least 2 in H, whence H contains a point h such that coker \u03a6h is\nsmooth. To show that a general such point has fiber rank 1, it suffices by a similar argument to show\n20\n\n\fthat the locus of element in Ml (k) in which the rank drops by at least 2 has codimension at least 2. This\ncan be settled by a trick: a perturbation argument shows that the locus in question is the boundary of\nthe locus of non-injective maps, which is itself of codimension 1.\n\u0003\nFor each i, define a k-stack Qi as follows. The objects of Qi over T are pairs (E, L) with E \u2282 Ci\u25e6 \u00d7 T a\nclosed subscheme which is finite \u00e9tale over T of degree n2 lH\ni and L an invertible GE -twisted sheaf\n` * C`\nsuch that if i = 1, . . . , s, then there is a partition E = E0 * * * El\u22121 with L|Ej \u2297 \u039b\u2228\ni isotypic of type\n\u03c7j . (If i > s there is no condition, and Qi parametrizes pairs (E, L) with L any invertible GE -twisted\nsheaf.)\nProposition 5.1.13. The stack Qi is irreducible.\nProof. First suppose i = 1, . . . , s,\u0010 so that Ri \u2192\u0011Ci\u25e6 is split. We claim that Qi is a torus-gerbe over the\nQl\u22121\ndense open subscheme of j=0 SymnlH*Ci Ci\u25e6 parametrizing (unordered) tuples of pairwise distinct\n`\n`\npoints. Indeed, given a pair (E, L) with partition E = E0 * * * El\u22121 , the partition defines a point\nof the product of symmetric powers which lies in the locus parametrizing pairwise distinct points.\nMoreover, this point completely characterizes the partition of E (including the weight assigned to the\nrestriction of L to each element of the partition). Thus, the fibers of this map are precisely given by\nstacks of line bundles on each Ei . These are gerbes banded by tori of rank nlH * Ci , since each Ei\nconsists of l points. Since the symmetric powers are irreducible, it follows that Qi is irreducible.\n2\nNow suppose that i > s. We claim that Qi is a gerbe over a dense open subscheme of Symn lH*Ci Ri\n2\nbanded`by a `\ntorus of rank n2 lH * Ci . To see that there is a map Qi \u2192 Symn lH*Ci Ri , note first that if\nE = T * * * T \u0592\u2192 (Ci\u25e6 )T is the trivial finite \u00e9tale cover then the invertible sheaf L yields n2 lH * Ci\nmaps from T to Ri , as Ri is the relative twisted Picard space. By composition, this gives a point of\n`\n`\n2\nSymn lH*Ci Ri . Moreover, acting by an automorphism of the pair (T * * * T \u0592\u2192 (Ci\u25e6 )T , L) (i.e., an\n2\nautomorphism of L) does not change the image point in Symn lH*Ci Ri . By descent theory, any pair\n2\n(E, L) gives rise to a point of Symn lH*Ci Ri , as desired. Since the (geometric) points of E are pairwise\n2\ndistinct in Ci\u25e6 , the image of (E, L) lies in the open subscheme O of Symn lH*Ci Ri parametrizing points\nwith pairwise distinct images in Ci .\nThe statement\ncan be checked \u00e9tale-locally\n` on`T , so we may assume\n`\n`that Qi is a torus gerbe over\n` O`\nthat E = T * * * T . Suppose two pairs (T * * * T \u0592\u2192 (Ci\u25e6 )T , L1 ) and (T * * * T \u0592\u2192 (Ci\u25e6 )T , L2 ) give\n2\nrise to the same point of Symn lH*Ci Ri . Since each summand T maps to a distinct section of (Ci\u25e6 )T , it\nfollows that upon possibly reordering the summands, for each summand T the two restrictions (L1 )T\nand (L2 )T must map to the same section of Ri and thus differ by an invertible sheaf on T . Shrinking\n2\nT if necessary, we see that any two pairs with the same image in Symn lH*Ci Ri are locally isomorphic.\n2\nIn addition, since any point of Symn lH*Ci Ri parametrizing distinct points comes \u00e9tale locally from a\nfinite collection of disjoint sections of Ri and Ri is the relative Picard space, we see that any section\nof O locally gives a point of Qi . Thus, Qi \u2192 O is a gerbe. Finally, the band of Qi is a torus because\nautomorphisms of a pair (E, L) are given by automorphisms of L, which is an invertible sheaf over a\nfinite \u00e9tale T -scheme of rank n2 lH * Ci .\nSince Ri is connected and smooth, it is irreducible, whence its symmetric powers are irreducible.\n2\nBut then, since a torus T is irreducible, we see that any T -gerbe over Symn lH*Ci Ri is also irreducible,\nas desired.\n\u0003\nQ\nLet Q = Qi . Define a geometric vector bundle over Q as follows. Let Q be the universal object on\nG \u00d7 Q.\nLemma 5.1.14. The complex R(pr2 )\u2217 RH om(Q, pr\u22171 V )[1] is quasi-isomorphic to a locally free sheaf F\non Q. Moreover, his sheaf has the property that for any affine scheme T and any morphism \u03c8 : T \u2192 Q,\nthe set FT (T ) parametrizes extensions 0 \u2192 V \u2192 W \u2192 Q \u2192 0 with Q the object of Q corresponding to \u03c8.\nProof. By standard nonsense, the complex R(pr2 )\u2217 RH om(Q, pr\u22171 V ) is perfect and commutes with arbitrary base change on Q. Moreover, since Q has torsion fibers (over pr2 ) and V is locally free, we have\nthat for each geometric point q : Spec \u03ba \u2192 Q the sheaf h0 (Lq \u2217 R(pr2 )\u2217 RH om(Q, pr\u22171 V )) is zero, and\n21\n\n\fsimilarly for hi with i > 1. It follows that R(pr2 )\u2217 RH om(Q, pr\u22171 V ) is a locally free sheaf concentrated\nin degree 1 of formation compatible with arbitrary base change on Q, with affine fibers the groups\nExt1 (Q, V ), as claimed.\n\u0003\nThus, we see that locally free extensions of objects of Q by V are parametrized by a dense open\nsubstack of the irreducible stack V(F \u2228 ). Let U \u2282 V(F \u2228 ) be the open stack parametrizing sheaves of\nthe form W (n), where W is a uniform G -twisted sheaf.\nProof of Theorem 5.1.2. First suppose U is non-empty. By Lemma 5.1.12, U is non-empty and the map\nU \u2192 U is surjective. Since U is irreducible, we conclude that U is irreducible, as desired.\nThus, it suffices to prove that U is non-empty, i.e., that there exists a uniform G -twisted sheaf of\nrank l2 and determinant O. This is somewhat subtle, and is carried out in Paragraph 5.1.15 below. \u0003\n5.1.15. In this paragraph, we will show that U is non-empty. Oddly enough, it is here that we must\nassume l is odd. Fix totally biregular G (j)-twisted sheaves V (j) for each singular gerbe \u03bej .\nLemma 5.1.16. It suffices to prove that for each i there is a uniform locally free Gi -twisted sheaf V\nof rank l2 with trivial determinant such that for each singular gerbe \u03bej contained in Ci , we have that\nV |\u03bej \u223c\n= V (j).\nProof. Indeed, we can glue the sheaves V together at the nodes of C to get a uniform sheaf on the\nentire residual curve. (This is trivial because k is now assumed to be algebraically closed.)\n\u0003\nProposition 5.1.17. The stack U is nonempty.\nProof. Using Lemma 5.1.16, we may assume C = Ci for a fixed i. If the ramification cover Ri \u2192 Ci is\nconnected then by definition we just need a locally free Gi -twisted sheaf with the given local structures\nV (j) and trivial determinant. Choosing any locally free Gi -twisted sheaf W of rank l2 with totally\nregular generic fiber, we can glue on the local structures V (j) as follows. Write xj \u2208 Ci for the image of\n\u03bej . Since \u03bcl is reductive, infinitesimal deformation of V (j) over Spf ObCi ,xj is unobstructed. Since Gi \u2192\nCi is proper, we can apply the Grothendieck existence theorem to any such infinitesimal obstruction\nto yield a locally free Gi \u2297 Spec(ObCi ,xj )-sheaf Vb whose restriction to \u03bej is isomorphic to V (j). On the\nother hand, writing K for the fraction field of ObCi ,xj , we have that WK and VbK are isomorphic (as there\nis only one totally regular structure of a given rank over a field). Choosing a generic isomorphism\nand applying Corollary 2.5.2 yields a locally free Gi -twisted sheaf V which is totally biregular and\nisomorphic to V (j) over \u03bej for each j.\nIt remains to handle the case in which Ri \u2192 Ci is split. In this case, since G is geometrically\ntrivial at residual gerbes (by assumption), there is an invertible Gi -twisted sheaf \u039b such that \u039b\u2297 l is\nthe pullback of an invertible sheaf \u03bb on Ci . Let V0 , V1 , . . . , Vl\u22121 be locally free sheaves on Ci such that\n(1) for each s = 0, . . . , l \u2212 1 the sheaf Vs is generically isotypic on the jth power of the generic\nstabilizer \u03bcl of Ci ,\n(2) for each j the restriction (Vs )(j) is isomorphic to the representation of \u03bcl \u00d7 \u03bcl which is the\nregular representation of the second factor tensored with the s-power character of the first\nfactor, and\n(3) the determinant of \u039b \u2297 Vs is trivial for each s.\nThis is possible because l is odd, so the regular representation has trivial determinant. The sheaf\n\u039b \u2297(V0 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vl\u22121 ) is then the desired uniform Gi -twisted sheaf of rank l2 .\n\u0003\n6. C URVES\n\nOVER HIGHER LOCAL FIELDS\n\nIn this section we fix a positive integer M .\nLet R be an excellent Henselian discrete valuation ring with fraction field K, uniformizer t, and\nresidue field k of characteristic exponent p. Suppose n is invertible in k and that R contains a primitive\nnth root of unity.\nLemma 6.1. There is an inclusion R \u2282 R\u2032 such that\n(1) R\u2032 is an excellent Henselian discrete valuation ring with uniformizer t;\n22\n\n\f(2) R\u2032 is a colimit of finite free extensions of R of p-power degree;\n(3) the morphism of residue fields k \u0592\u2192 k \u2032 identifies k \u2032 with a perfect closure of k.\nProof. If p = 1, we R\u2032 = R; for the rest of the proof, we assume that p > 1. Given an element x\u0304 \u2208 k \\ k p ,\nwe can choose a lift x \u2208 R and consider the extension S = R[y]/(y p \u2212 x). It is easy to see that S is finite\nand free over R of degree p and that t generates a maximal ideal, so that S is a dvr with uniformizer t.\nThe result follows by transfinite induction.\n\u0003\nLemma 6.2. If k has M \u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a and C is a nodal (possibly non-proper) curve over\nk, then for any \u03bcn -gerbe S \u2192 C with n \u2208 M \u2032 , there is a locally free S -twisted sheaf of rank na .\nProof. The conclusion holds when C is smooth by the definition of the Brauer dimension and the fact\nthat a torsion-free coherent twisted sheaf is locally free (so that any coherent torsion-free extension of\na generic twisted sheaf will satisfy the conclusion of the lemma). Thus, the conclusion holds for the\nnormalization of C. Moreover, at a node of C, the restrictions of the locally free S -twisted sheaves on\nthe two branches are isomorphic. It follows by a basic descent argument that the locally free sheaves\non the components of C may be glued at the nodes to achieve the desired result.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.3. If k has M \u2032 -Brauer dimension at most a then K has (M p)\u2032 -Brauer dimension at most\na + 1.\nProof. We have to check two things: (1) for any finite extension J of K and any \u03b1 \u2208 Br\u2032 (J) we have\nthat ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)a , and (2) for any finitely generated extension J(D) of transcendence degree 1 and\nany \u03b1 \u2208 Br\u2032 (J(D)) we have ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)a+1 .\nFirst, let J be a finite extension of K with ring of integers S and uniformizer u. Given a Brauer class\n\u03b1 \u2208 Br(J) of period n prime to p, it is clear that \u03b1 will be unramified over S[u1/n ], which is finite free of\ndegree n over S. Let X \u2192 Spec S[u1/n ] be a \u03bcn -gerbe representing \u03b1. The residue field L has Brauer\ndimension at most a by hypothesis, so that there is a locally free X \u2297 L-twisted sheaf of rank na\u22121 .\nDeformation theory lifts this to a locally free X -twisted sheaf of rank na\u22121 , which pushes forward at\nthe generic point to yield a locally free twisted sheaf of rank na on a gerbe over Spec J representing \u03b1.\nThis completes the proof of (1).\nIt remains to verify (2). Any finitely generated extension of transcendence degree 1 has the form\nJ(D) with J finite over K and D a geometrically integral curve over J. Given \u03b1 \u2208 Br\u2032 (J(D)), we may\nnormalize R in J and thus assume that J = K. We may also assume that per(\u03b1) = n is prime (and\nrelatively prime to p by assumption). By the standard finite-presentation tricks, we see that we can\nreplace R with the R\u2032 of Lemma 6.1 and thus assume that k is perfect.\nLet X \u2192 Spec R be a regular model of D over R, which exists by [27]. After blowing up X if necessary,\nwe may assume that the union of the ramification divisor of \u03b1 and the (reduced) special fiber of X/R\nis a strict normal crossings divisor. Applying Corollary 3.1.4, we see that there is an orbisurface X /T\nwith a generically finite map X \u2192 X of degree n over which \u03b1 is unramified. It thus suffices to show\nthat the index of \u03b1 restricted to X divides na . Let G \u2192 X be a \u03bcn -gerbe representing \u03b1 and write X0\nfor the reduced structure on the special fiber of X over T .\nIn order to prove (2), it suffices to find a locally free G -twisted sheaf of rank na . Since X0 is 1dimensional and tame, we see from Proposition 2.2.3 that any locally free G |X0 twisted sheaf of rank\nna has vanishing obstruction space and thus deforms to a locally free formal G -twisted sheaf. Applying\nthe Grothendieck existence theorem (Proposition 2.2.3(3)), we can effectivize the deformation to yield a\nlocally free G -twisted sheaf of rank na . Thus, it suffices to show that there is a locally free G |X0 -twisted\nsheaf of rank na .\nWrite \u03c0 : X0 \u2192 Y for the coarse moduli space of the stack X0 . There are finitely many closed points\ny1 , . . . , yr \u2208 Y such that (1) \u03c0 is an isomorphism over Y \\ {y1 , . . . , yr } and (2) the reduced structure\n\u03bei := (X0 \u00d7Y yi )red is isomorphic to B\u03bcn,\u03ba(yi ) for each i. Applying Corollary 4.1.5 and the hypothesis\nthat k has Brauer dimension at most a, we see that for each i = 1, . . . , r, there is a locally free G |\u03bei twisted sheaf V i of rank na . Moreover, since \u03bcn is reductive, it follows from Proposition 2.2.3 that\ninfinitesimal deformations of V i are universally unobstructed (the obstruction space vanishes). Thus,\n23\n\n\f(i)\nwriting X0 = X0 \u00d7Y Spec ObY,yi , it follows from Proposition 2.2.3(3) that for each i = 1, . . . , r, there is\na locally free GX (i) -twisted sheaf of rank na .\n0\nOn the other hand, C := X0 \\ {\u03be1 , . . . , \u03bes } \u223c\n= Y \\ {y1 , . . . , yr } is a nodal curve over k, so by Lemma 6.2\nthere is a locally free GC -twisted sheaf of rank na . Applying Corollary 2.5.2, we see that we can glue\n(i)\nthe twisted sheaf over C to the twisted sheaves on each X0 to find a locally free G |X0 -twisted sheaf\na\nof rank n , as desired.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 6.4. Let C be a regular curve over a field K and \u03b1 \u2208 Br(K(C)).\n(1) If K is a d-local field with finite residue field of characteristic p and per(\u03b1) \u2208 p\u2032 then ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d+1 .\n(2) If K is a d \u2212 1-local with residue field of transcendence degree 1 over an algebraically closed field\n(e.g., K = k(x1 )((x2 )) * * * ((xd ))) of characteristic exponent p and per(\u03b1) \u2208 p\u2032 , then ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)d .\n(3) If K is an algebraic extension of a local field of residual characteristic exponent p which contains\nthe maximal unramified extension and per(\u03b1) \u2208 p\u2032 , then ind(\u03b1) = per(\u03b1).\nProof. The first two statements follow by induction, starting with class field theory or de Jong's theorem [10], while the third is a direct application of the theorem (after reducing to the case where K is\nfinite over the maximal unramified extension).\n\u0003\n7. C URVES\n\nOVER GLOBAL FIELDS\n\nLet C/K be a proper smooth curve over a global field with a point P \u2208 C(K). In this section we link\nthe period-index problem for certain classes in Br(C) to the Hasse principle for geometrically rational\nvarieties over K.\nWe first recall a well-known conjecture of Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne. What is written here is a special case.\nFor the general case (which just says that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only one for 0-cycles of\ndegree 1 on smooth proper varieties) the reader is referred to Conjecture 2.5 of [5].\nConjecture 7.1 (Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne). Suppose V /K is a smooth projective variety such that V \u2297 K is rational and Pic(V \u2297 K) = Z. If there is a 0-cycle of degree 1 on V \u2297 K\u03bd for all places \u03bd of K then there is\na 0-cycle of degree 1 on V .\nWe will link this to the period-index problem as follows. Write BrP (C) for the kernel of the restriction\nmap P \u2217 : Br(C) \u2192 Br(K). Given an integer n, say that a place of K(C) divides n if the restriction of\nthe valuation on K(C) to the prime field has residue field of characteristic dividing n. (In geometric\nlanguage, the center of the valuation on a proper model of C over a scheme of integers of K has image\ncontained in the closed subscheme cut out by the function n * 1.)\nTheorem 7.2. If Conjecture 7.1 holds, then any \u03b1 \u2208 BrP (C) of odd period which is unramified at all\nplaces dividing per(\u03b1) satisfies ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)2 .\nProof of Theorem 7.2 when \u03b1 has prime period l. Let per(\u03b1) = l. If K has characteristic 0, let T be the\nscheme of integers in K; if K has positive characteristic, choose a transcendence basis for K and let\nT be the normalization of P1 in the resulting function field extension. We will call T \"the\" scheme of\nintegers of K. Note that when K has infinite places \u221e, the assumption that per \u03b1 is odd implies that\n\u03b1|C\u221e = 0.\nTaking a branched cover if necessary, we may assume that C has genus at least 2. Choose a regular\nproper model C \u2192 T and let D \u2282 C be the ramification divisor of \u03b1. Since \u03b1 \u2208 Br(C), we see that D\nis supported in finitely many fibers of C \u2192 T , and the assumption on the ramification not dividing\nthe period of \u03b1 shows that the residue fields of the components of D have characteristics prime to l.\nUsing Lipman resolution [27], we may assume that the fibers containing the ramification divisor of \u03b1\nform a snc divisor which we will abusively write as D \u2282 C. Applying Proposition 3.2.1, we see that \u03b1\nextends to a class in Br(C{D1/l }). Moreover, the scheme D is a union of finitely many residual curves\nD1 , . . . , Db . Choosing a \u03bcl -gerbe G \u2192 C{D1/l } such that G |CK = 0, we see that for each i = 1, . . . , b,\nthere is a locally free G |Di -twisted sheaf of trivial determinant and rank N l2 with l 6 |N . Taking direct\nsums if necessary, we may assume that N is the same for all i.\nLet V \u2192 Spec K be the stack of stable locally free GK -twisted sheaves of rank N l2 with determinant\nO(P ). It follows from Proposition 3.1.1.6 of [24] and [16] that V is a \u03bcN l2 -gerbe over a smooth projective\n24\n\n\fgeometrically rational K-variety V with Pic(V \u2297 K) = Z. We claim that there exists an N relatively\nprime to l such that for all places \u03bd of K, we have V (K\u03bd ) 6= \u2205. Assuming we have done this, we can then\napply Conjecture 7.1 to conclude that V has a 0-cycle of degree 1. Moreover, since we will prove that\nthe stack (and not merely the coarse space) has local points, it follows from a simple argument with\nthe Leray spectral sequence that Br(K) \u2192 Br(V ) is surjective and then that the Brauer class of V \u2192 V\nis trivial. Thus, the 0-cycle of degree 1 on V lifts to V . But then there is a locally free GK -twisted sheaf\nof rank M l2 for some M relatively prime to l, so that ind(\u03b1)|M l2 . Since per(\u03b1) = l, we conclude by\nstandard methods that ind(\u03b1)|l2 , as desired.\nThus, it remains to find local objects in V (K\u03bd ). Since adjoining a primitive lth root of unity is a\nprime-to-l extension, we may assume by Lemma 5.1.4 that K contains a primitive lth root of unity.\nIf \u03bd is not in the image of the ramification locus (including infinite \u03bd), we claim that \u03b1|K\u03bd = 0. If \u03bd is\ninfinite this is an elementary parity argument. If \u03bd is finite, then this follows from the fact that the\nBrauer group of a proper curve over a complete dvr with finite residue field is finite. In these cases,\nthe existence of an object of V (K\u03bd ) follows immediately from the fact that stable vector bundles of\narbitrary invariants exist on curves of genus at least 2 over any infinite field.\nNow suppose \u03bd has center under one of the residual curves Di . By Corollary 5.1.3, there is some N\nrelatively prime to l and a locally free G |Di -twisted sheaf Vi of rank l2 and trivial determinant. Taking\nsuitable direct sums, we may assume that N is independent of i. The deformation theory of twisted\nsheaves in Proposition 2.2.3 shows that Vi deforms to yield a locally free G \u2297 K\u03bd -twisted sheaf Vei of\nrank N l2 with trivial determinant. Since \u03b1|P = 0, we can make an elementary transform to yield a\nlocally free G \u2297 K\u03bd -twisted sheaf Wi of rank N l2 and determinant O(P ). Let S denote the stack of\nall locally free G \u2297 K\u03bd -twisted sheaves of rank N l2 and determinant O(P ). We know that V \u2282 S is\na dense open immersion of irreducible smooth stacks. Thus, any algebraic deformation of Wi over a\nsmooth base which is versal at [Wi ] will contain a dense open parametrizing stable sheaves. But any\nsmooth connected K\u03bd -variety with a rational variety has a dense set of rational points, so we conclude\nthat there is a rational point parametrizing a stable twisted sheaf, yielding an object of V (K\u03bd ), as\ndesired.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 7.2 in the general case. The Schur decomposition of \u03b1 immediately reduces to the situation where per(\u03b1) is a prime power, say per(\u03b1) = ln . The class \u03b1\u2032 := ln\u22121 \u03b1 has period l, so assuming\nthat we have treated the case of prime period (done below), we can find a covering X \u2032 \u2192 X of degree l2\nsplitting \u03b1\u2032 . Since the pullback of \u03b1 to X \u2032 has period ln\u22121 , we are done by induction, given the following\n(crucial) lemma.\nLemma 7.3. If \u03b2 \u2208 Br(OX,P ) is a class whose restriction to P is trivial, then there is a splitting field\nK \u2032 /K(X) such that the normalization of X in K \u2032 has a K-rational point lying over P .\nProof. Let P \u2192 Spec OX,P be a Brauer-Severi scheme representing \u03b2. Since P \u2297 \u03ba(P ) is trivial, there is\na \u03ba(P )-rational point Q \u2208 PP . Let U be an affine neighborhood of Q in P. Choose a regular sequence\nf 1 , . . . , f d cutting out Q in the fiber PP and choose arbitrary lifts f1 , . . . , fd \u2208 OP (U ). Let Z be the\nsubscheme of U determined by f1 , . . . , fd . By construction, Z is flat over OX,P and normal at Q with\nresidue field K = \u03ba(P ). It follows that the generic fiber of Z gives rise to the desired splitting field. \u0003\nApplying the lemma in our situation, we see that there is some X \u2032 \u2192 X splitting \u03b1\u2032 , possibly of\nlarge degree, such that there is a rational point Q \u2208 X \u2032 (K) over P . This property clearly holds for any\nintermediate curve X \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032\u2032 \u2192 X. Since \u03b1\u2032 has index dividing l2 , there will be such an intermediate\ncurve X \u2032\u2032 of degree l2 over X, and we know that there is a rational point Q \u2208 X \u2032\u2032 (K) such that \u03b1|Q = 0.\nThus, we can proceed by induction.\n\u0003\nWe can also get the first \"proof \" of the standard conjecture for a class of C3 -fields.\nCorollary 7.4. Suppose Y is a proper smooth surface over a finite field Fq . Given \u03b1 \u2208 Br(Fq (Y ))\u2032 , if\nConjecture 7.1 holds then ind(\u03b1)| per(\u03b1)2 .\nSketch of proof. We first record an argument due to de Jong for fibering a birational model Y so that\nthe ramification of \u03b1 ends up in a fiber. We can replace Fq with its maximal prime-to-q extension and\nthus assume that the base field is an infinite algebraic extension of its finite prime field.\n25\n\n\fWe may assume that the ramification divisor of \u03b1 is a strict normal crossings (snc) divisor D =\nD1 + * * * + Dm \u2282 Y . For each component Di , there is a finite ramification extension Di\u2032 \u2192 Di . By the\nChebotarev density theory, there are closed points di \u2208 Di of arbitrarily high degree such that Di\u2032 is\ntotally split over di . It is an exercise to check (by examining the Henselian local structure of \u03b1 near di\nas in e.g. Proposition 1.2 of [34]) that the ramification divisor of \u03b1 in the blow up Y at di is the strict\ntransform of D.\nBlowing up enough such di , we may assume that D is contained in a snc divisor E whose components\nhave a negative definite intersection matrix. By Theorem 2.9(B) of [2], there is a morphism to a normal\nprojective surface Y \u2192 Y which is an isomorphism outside of E. In particular, taking a pencil of very\nample divisors on Y which meet transversely in the smooth locus, we see that a blow-up of Y in finitely\nmany smooth points fibers over P1 with a section passing entirely through the smooth locus. Blowing\nup the corresponding locus in Y yields a blow up Ye \u2192 Y and a proper flat morphism \u03c0 : Ye \u2192 P1 with\na section P : P1 \u2192 Ye such that\n(1) \u03c0 has smooth geometrically connected generic fiber;\n(2) the ramification of \u03b1 is entirely contained in a fiber of \u03c0;\n(3) \u03b1|P = 0.\nThe last statement follows from the fact that any base point of the pencil gives rise to a section, and\nthat Br(P1 ) = 0.\nWriting C for the generic fiber of \u03c0, we have that \u03b1 \u2208 BrP (C). If q is odd or q is even and the period\nof \u03b1 is odd then the period-index relation now follows immediately from Theorem 7.2. If q is even and\nper(\u03b1) is 2 then the the result follows from the fact that the absolute Frobenius F : Y \u2192 Y is finite\nlocally free of degree 4 and acts as multiplication by 2 on the Brauer group. The general case follows\nfrom the Schur decomposition and induction on the power of 2 dividing the period.\n\u0003\nA PPENDIX A. P ERIOD - INDEX\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nDaniel Krashen\nYale University\nIn this appendix to the paper of Max Lieblich, we will construct examples of division algebras over\ncertain fields in order to demonstrate that the bounds given in corollary 1.4 are sharp. The main tool\nin doing this is the use of valuation theory for division algebras as in [39]. I would like to thank A.\nWadsworth for pointing out some results in the literature which helped to shorten the exposition of\nthese examples.\nA.1. Curves over iterated Laurent series fields. Let k be an algebraically closed field, char(k) 6= p.\nLet K = k((x1 )) * * * ((xr ))(t). In this section, we will construct a division algebra over K with period p\nand index pr .\nLet K \u2032 = k(t)((x1 )) * * * ((xr )). Note that K \u2032 is a Henselian valued field with values in Zr and with\nresidue field k(t). Also note that we have inclusions k(t) \u2282 K \u2282 K \u2032 . Let l/k(t) be abelian Galois with\ngroup (Z/p)r . By Kummer theory, we may write l = l1 \u2297k(t) * * * \u2297k(t) lr , with li = k(t)(\u03b1i ), \u03b1pi = ai \u2208 k(t).\nUsing [39], example 3.6, we note that the inertial lifts L\u2032i = K \u2032 (\u03b1i ) of the li are cyclic Galois, say with\ngenerators \u03c3i of the Galois group, and that the algebra\nA\u2032 = (L\u20321 /K \u2032 , \u03c31 , x1 ) \u2297K \u2032 * * * \u2297K \u2032 (L\u2032r /K \u2032 , \u03c3r , xr )\nis a (nicely semi-ramified) division algebra. Therefore, if we set Li = K(\u03b1i ) and\nA = (L1 /K, \u03c31 , x1 ) \u2297K * * * \u2297K (Lr /K, \u03c3r , xr ),\nwe have A \u2282 A \u2297K K \u2032 = A\u2032 . Since A\u2032 is division, A contains no zerodivisors and therefore must also be\ndivision. Therefore A is a division algebra of index pr and period p as desired.\nA.2. Curves over higher local fields. In this section we will construct division algebras of period\np and index pr+1 over fields of the form F (t), where F is a r-local field in the following two cases:\nF = Fq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr )) with q 6= p or F = Qq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr\u22121 )) with p|(q \u2212 1).\n26\n\n\fLemma A.2.1. Let k be a global field, and choose l/k Galois with group (Z/p)r = h\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3r i. Then we\nmay choose a cyclic division algebra D/k of index p such that D \u2297 l is still division.\nProof. To do this we simply note that by Chebotarev density (see [36], or [15]), there are infinitely\nmany primes such that our field extension l is completely split. Let P be such a prime in k. By\nCassels-Fr\u00f6hlich page 187 corollary 9.8, a central simple algebra with a nontrivial Hasse invariant at\nP must remain nontrivial upon extending scalars to l. Therefore, we may simply choose an arbitrary\ndivision algebra with a Hasse invariant of order p at P. Since the period is equal to the index over a\nglobal field, this algebra also has index p.\n\u0003\nRecall that we have either:\n(1) K = Fq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr ))(t) with q 6= p or\n(2) K = Qq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr\u22121 ))(t) with p|(q \u2212 1).\nIn the second case, we let xr = q, and in each case K posseses a valuation into the (lexicographically)\nordered abelian group Zr with uniformizers x1 , . . . , xr . Let K \u223c\n= Fq (t) be the residue field.\nSince K is global, we may choose a extension l/K and a symbol algebra D as in lemma A.2.1.\nLemma A.2.2. We may find an unramified abelian extension L/K of dimension pr and an inertial\nsymbol algebra D/K of degree p such that L = l and D = D.\nUsing this lemma, it follows that if we write L as the compositum of the cyclic algebras Li with cyclic\nGalois groups generated by \u03c3i , then the algebra\nA = D \u2297K (L1 /K, \u03c31 , x1 ) \u2297K * * * \u2297K (Lr /K, \u03c31 , xr )\nis a (valued) division algebra by [29], theorem 1. Therefore we will have the desired algebra of index\npr+1 and period p.\nProof.\nCase (1). K = Fq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr ))(t).\ne = l \u2297 K((x1 )) * * * ((xr ))\nWe have natural inclusions K \u2282 K \u2282 K((x1 )) * * * ((xr )). It is well known that L\nK\ne\nand D = D \u2297K K((x1 )) * * * ((xr )) are both division (for example, this follows from lemma A.2.3 below).\ne and L\ne and one\nSince K((x1 )) * * * ((xr )) is Henselian valued, it follows that the valuation extends to D\nmay check that these are unramified. Therefore, if we define L = l \u2297K K and D = D \u2297K K, we have\ne and D \u2282 D,\ne and in particular both are domains and hence division. These clearly have the\nL \u2282 L\ndesired properties.\nCase (2). K = Qq ((x1 )) * * * ((xr\u22121 ))(t) with p|(q \u2212 1).\nBy the assumption on p and q, we know that by Hensel's lemma, K and Qq (t) (and hence K) contain\na primitive p'th root of unity which we will always denote by \u03c9. Therefore Kummer theory applies and\nwe may write l = l1 \u2297K * * * \u2297K lr , with each li = K(\u03b1i ), \u03b1pi = ai \u2208 K. Also, we may write D as a symbol\nalgebra D = (a, b)K,\u03c9 .\ne = (e\nChoose lifts aei , e\na, eb \u2208 Zq (t)\u2217 \u2282 K of ai , a, b respectively. Set Li = K(\u03b1ei ), \u03b1ei p = aei , and let D\na, eb)\u03c9 .\ne\ne\nWe will now demonstrate that L = L1 \u2297K * * * \u2297K Lr , D, and L \u2297K D are division algebras. To check\nthis it suffices to show that these K algebras are division algebras after being tensored over K with\nQp (t)((x1 )) * * * ((xr\u22121 )). In other words, if we let F = Qq (t)((x1 )) * * * ((xr\u22121 )), we may replace Li with\ne with D\u2032 = (e\nL\u2032i = F (e\n\u03b1) and D\na, eb)F,\u03c9 . Let OF = Zp (t)[[x1 , . . . , xr\u22121 ]]. Note that OF is a valuation ring\nwith quotient field F and residue field F = Fp (t) = K. If we let OD\u2032 be the algebra (e\na, eb)OF ,\u03c9 , and\nOL\u2032i = OF (\u03b1ei ), then we have\nOD\u2032 \u2297OF F = D ,\nOL\u2032i \u2297OF F =\n\nL\u2032i\n\u0001\n\n,\n\nOD\u2032 \u2297OF F = D\nOL\u2032i \u2297OF F = li\n\nOL\u20321 \u2297OF * * * \u2297OF OL\u2032r \u2297OF F = L\u20321 \u2297F * * * \u2297F L\u2032r ,\n\u0001\nOL\u20321 \u2297OF * * * \u2297OF OL\u2032r \u2297OF F = l1 \u2297K * * * \u2297K lr .\n27\n\n\fThe fact that the desired algebras are division now follows from lemma A.2.3.\nIt remains to show that the division algebra D = (e\na, eb) and the field L = K(f\n\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1\nfr ) posses\nunramified valuations. For each of the given algebras, this can be checked directly. Let B be the\nstandard basis of one of these - in the first case consisting of expressions of the form \u03b1i \u03b2 j , 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 p\u22121\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the standard generators of the symbol algebra, or in the second case consisting of\nexpressions of the form \u03b1n1 1 * * * \u03b1nr r , 0 \u2264 ni \u2264 p \u2212 1. We may then define our valuation via\nX\nv(\n\u03bbb b) = min{v(\u03bb)}.\nb\u2208B\n\nb\u2208B\n\nOne may now observe that this is an unramified valuation.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma A.2.3. Let R be a valuation ring with residue field k and field of fractions F . Suppose that A\nis an R-algebra which is free of finite rank as an R-module, and that A \u2297R k is a division algebra. Then\nA \u2297R F is also a division algebra.\nProof. The norm polynomial on A defines a projective and hence proper scheme X over Spec(R). It is\neasy to see that A \u2297R L is a domain if and only if X(L) = \u2205. In particular, if A \u2297R F was not a domain,\nwe would have a point in X(F ), and by the valuative criterion for properness, we would thereby obtain\na point in X(k), contradicting the fact that A \u2297R k is a domian. The conclusion now follows from the\nobservation that a finite dimensional domain is a division algebra.\n\u0003\nR EFERENCES\n[1] Dan Abramovich, Alessio Corti, and Angelo Vistoli.
