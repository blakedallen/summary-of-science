We study conserved models of crystal growth in one dimension [\u2202t z(x, t) =\n\u2212\u2202x j(x, t)] which are linearly unstable and develop a mound structure whose typical\nsize L increases in time (L \u223c tn ). If the local slope (m = \u2202x z) increases indefinitely, n\ndepends on the exponent \u03b3 characterizing the large m behaviour of the surface current\nj (j \u223c 1/|m|\u03b3 ): n = 1/4 for 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 3 and n = (1 + \u03b3)/(1 + 5\u03b3) for \u03b3 > 3.\n\nThe conserved dynamics of a solid surface growing under the action of an external\nflux of particles is described by the continuum equation\n\u2202t z(x, t) = \u2212\u2202x j(x, t) + \u03b4F (x, t) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z(x, t) is the local height of the surface in a comoving frame (so that the average\nvalue z\u0304 is set to 0) and \u03b4F (x, t) is the shot noise.\nThermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms contribute to j and its actual expression\ndepends on the details of the growth process. Here we are interested in the growth of\na high-symmetry surface by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), where the instability has\na purely kinetic origin: the reduced interlayer diffusion [1]. Nonetheless, our treatment\nwill be as general as possible.\nA wide class of models is described by the current\nj = Km\u2032\u2032 (x) + jES (m) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m = \u2202x z is the local slope. The first term generally describes a thermally activated\nrelaxation of the surface, but kinetic mechanisms can also contribute to K [2].\nThe second term is responsible for the instability and its origin is an asymmetry\nin the sticking process of an adatom to a step (Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) effect): sticking\nfrom the upper terrace is hindered and this implies an up-hill current [3] which is\ncalled Ehrlich-Schwoebel current (jES ). Also other (generally stabilizing) processes can\ncontribute to jES and this explains the different expressions jES may take [4].\n\u266f Dedicated to the Peanuts on the occasion of their 50th birthday.\n\u2217 Corresponding author. Fax: +39 055 229330, E-mail: politi@fi.infn.it\n+\nE-mail: torcini@fi.infn.it, URL: http://torcini.de.unifi.it/\u223ctorcini\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n2\n\nWhatever these processes are, jES is linear in m at small slopes (jES \u223c \u03bdm) and\ntherefore in the early stages of the growth it prevails on the first term (Km\u2032\u2032 ) at\nsufficiently large wavelengths. This means that the linear stability of the flat surface\nwill be decided by the sign of \u03bd, a positive one meaning instability. In fact, in the limit\nm \u2192 0 we have\n\u2202t z = \u2212K\u2202x4 z \u2212 \u03bd\u2202x2 z\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202t m = \u2202x2 (\u2212j) + \u2202x (\u03b4F )\n\n(4)\n\nwhose solution is z(x, t) = exp(\u03c9q t) cos(qx) with \u03c9q = \u03bdq 2 \u2212 Kq 4 . An up-hill current\nmeans that jES has the same sign as the slope, so \u03bd is positive and the flat\nq surface\nis unstable (\u03c9q > 0) against modulations of wavevector smaller than q\u0304 = \u03bd/K; the\ninstability appears after a typical time of order t\u2217 \u2243 (\u03bd q\u0304 2 )\u22121 = K/\u03bd 2 .\nThe later evolution of the surface depends on the nonlinear form of the unstable\ncurrent jES (m). By taking the spatial derivative of Eq. (1), we obtain\n\nand a parallel with a phase ordering process is easily done, once we remark that the\ncurrent can be obtained by a pseudo free energy F :\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03b4F\nK\n2\nj=\u2212\n, F [m] = dx\n(\u2202x m) + V (m) , V \u2032 (m) = \u2212jES (m) .(5)\n\u03b4m\n2\n\u2032\nThe instability of the flat surface (jES (0) > 0) means that the potential V (m) has\na maximum in m = 0 (V \u2032\u2032 (0) < 0). Contiguous regions of increasing and opposite\nslope are formed. The usual phase ordering process is obtained when V (m) has the\nclassical double well form: V (m) = \u2212(\u03bd/2)m2 + (\u03bd/4m20 )m4 , corresponding to a current\njES = \u03bdm(1 \u2212m2 /m20 ). After the slope has attained a fraction of m0 the dynamics enters\nin the nonlinear regime: the wavelength L of the profile increases in time (coarsening\nprocess) and the slope saturates to the constant values \u00b1m0 . The coarsening law is\nknown to be logarithmic [5] (L(t) \u223c ln t) in absence of shot noise and a power law [6]\n(L(t) \u223c t1/3 ), in presence of it.\nThe aim of the present paper is to analyze the deterministic (\u03b4F (x, t) \u2261 0) growth\nprocess when V (m) has no minima, corresponding to the absence of zeros at finite slopes\nin the current jES . We will consider the class of currents defined by\n\u03bdm\nwith \u03b1 \u2265 1\n(6)\njES =\n(1 + l2 m2 )\u03b1\nand the corresponding models will be termed \u03b1-models.\nModel-1 has been studied numerically by Hunt et al [7] and they found a coarsening\nexponent n \u2248 0.22 (L(t) \u223c tn ). \u03b1-Models without noise have been studied analytically\nby Golubovi\u0107 [8] through scaling arguments and he finds n = 1/4 irrespectively of \u03b1.\nFinally, qualitative considerations based on noise effects [9] give n = 1/(2/\u03b1 + 3), i.e.\nn = 1/5 for model-1.\nOur analytical approach is based on the linear stability analysis of the stationary\nconfigurations j[m(x)] \u2261 0. This way, the finding of the coarsening exponent n passes\nthrough the determination of the lowest eigenvalue of the operator (\u2212\u2202x2 )\u0124, where \u0124 is\nthe Hamiltonian corresponding to a particle in a periodic potential [5].\n\n\f3\n\nLetter to the Editor\n\nBefore proceeding we render adimensional the growth equation by rescaling x with\n1/q\u0304, t with t\u2217 and z with 1/q\u0304l:\nm\n.\n(7)\n\u2202t z = \u2212\u2202x j ,\nj = m\u2032\u2032 +\n(1 + m2 )\u03b1\nStationary configurations are the solutions of the differential equation j[m(x)] =\nm + jES (m) \u2261 0. Therefore they correspond to the periodic orbits of a particle in\nthe potential \u2212V (m) = \u2212[1/2(\u03b1 \u2212 1)](1 + m2 )1\u2212\u03b1 for \u03b1 > 1 and in the potential\n\u2212V (m) = (1/2) ln(1 + m2 ) for \u03b1 = 1. In the former case the potential is upper bounded\nand the solution corresponding to the boundary conditions m \u2192 \u00b1\u221e when x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\ndoes exist, while it does not for \u03b1 = 1 because the corresponding energy would be\ninfinite. Stationary solutions may be labelled with their period, i.e. the wavelength L:\nmL (x).\nLet us now perform a linear stability analysis around these stationary and periodic\nsolutions: m(x, t) = mL (x) + \u03c8(x, t). It is easily found that\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2202t \u03c8 = \u2202x2 [\u2212\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (x, t) + UL (x)\u03c8] ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u2032\nwhere UL (x) \u2261 \u2212jES\n(mL (x)). By putting \u03c8(x, t) = \u03c6(x) exp(\u2212\u01ebt) we obtain\n\n(\u2212\u2202x2 ) [\u2212\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (x) + UL (x)\u03c6] \u2261 Dx \u0124\u03c6(x) = \u01eb\u03c6 .\n\n(9)\n\nNegative eigenvalues mean that mL (x) is linearly unstable and this induces the\ncoarsening process; moreover, \u01eb(L) \u2192 0\u2212 when L \u2192 \u221e. The dependence of the ground\nstate (GS) energy on the distance L determines the time scale of the coarsening process:\nt \u223c 1/|\u01eb(L)|. For the moment we will assume Dx \u2261 1, i.e. we will consider the\nnonconserved model: \u2202t m = \u2212\u03b4F /\u03b4m.\nFirst of all we observe that in the limit of large L the energy shift \u01eb(L) for the\nperiodic potential is equal (up to a numerical factor) to the shift for a single couple of\npotential wells [10]. The solution of the problem is given [11] in terms of \u03c60 and \u03c61 ,\nrespectively the ground state for the single well U1 (x), centered in x = L, and for the\ndouble well U2 (x), centered in x = \u00b1L. In fact the Schroedinger equations are:\n\u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u20320 + U1 \u03c60 = 0 (a)\nand by evaluating the quantity\n\u03c61 (0)\u03c6\u20320 (0) = \u2212\u01eb\n\nR\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n0\n\u221e\n\n\u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u20321 + U2 \u03c61 = \u01eb\u03c61 (b)\n\n(10)\n\ndx[\u03c61 \u00d7 (10a) \u2212 \u03c60 \u00d7 (10b)] = 0, we obtain\ndx\u03c60 (x)\u03c61 (x) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere we have made use of U1 = U2 for x > 0.\nBefore proceeding we must determine the asymptotic expressions of \u03c60 (x) and\n\u2032\n(m) is given, for \u03b1-models, by\n\u03c61 (x).

On the other hand, for \u03b1 > 2 \u03c60 (x) is a bound state and\nstate, since \u2212\u221e\n\u221a\n\u03c61 (x) can be approximated [11] with the expression \u03c61 (x) = [\u03c60 (x) + \u03c60 (\u2212x)]/ 2. This\nway, from (11) we easily obtain the relation\nU(x) \u2248\n\n\u01eb \u2243 \u22122\u03c60 (0)\u03c6\u20320 (0) \u2248 \u2212L\u2212(2\u03b2+1)\n\n[\u03b1 > 2 and Dx = 1] .\n(15)\n\u221a\nIf \u03b1 < 2, we can put \u03c61 (x) = [\u03c6\u03030 (x) + \u03c6\u03030 (\u2212x)]/ 2 where \u03c6\u03030 is a generalization of\n\u03c60 to a negative eigenvalue: \u2212\u03c6\u0303\u2032\u20320 (x) + (a/x2 )\u03c6\u03030 (x) = \u01eb\u03c6\u03030 (x). In fact, even if \u03c60 is not a\nbound state, \u03c61 is bounded, because the GS energy \u01eb is strictly lower than U2 (\u00b1\u221e) = 0.\nThe previous expression for \u03c61 may be used even if \u03c60 itself is bounded (i.e. for \u03b1 > 2)\nand the result for the coarsening exponent does not change.\nq\n\u221a\nThe asymptotic expression for \u03c6\u03030 is \u03c6\u03030 (x) = xK\u03bc ( |\u01eb|x) where K\u03bc is the modified\nBessel function of order \u03bc = \u03b2 \u2212 (1/2).

Eq. (11) now writes\n\u01eb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndx\u03c60 (x)\u03c6\u03030 (x) = \u22122\u03c6\u03030 (0)\u03c6\u20320 (0)\n\n[\u03b1 \u2264 2 and Dx = 1] ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03030 (x) depends on \u01eb. Let us remark that the integral I on the left hand side does\nconverge even if \u03c60 is not a bound state.\nThe evaluation of the two sides of Eq. (16) is a bit lengthy and we report here\nthe result only: |\u01eb| ln(1/|\u01eb|) \u223c 1/L2 if \u03b1 = 2 and |\u01eb| \u223c 1/L2 if 1 < \u03b1 < 2. In\nFig. 1 we compare the analytical results for the exponent characterizing the energy\nshift |\u01eb(L)| \u223c L\u22121/n with those obtained through its direct numerical evaluation [12]\nand the agreement is very good.\nTherefore, for the nonconserved model we can conlude that:\n1\n1\n(1 < \u03b1 \u2264 2) and n =\n(\u03b1 > 2), (17)\n[nonconserved] n =\n2\n3 \u2212 2/\u03b1\n\nwith a logarithmic correction for \u03b1 = 2 (L \u223c (t/ ln t)1/2 ).\nThe reason why the coarsening exponent n keeps constant for \u03b1 < 2 is the following:\nif \u03b1 > 2 the single-well wavefunction is a bound state, the integral I is a constant\nwhile the 'superposition' between \u03c60 (x) and \u03c60 (\u2212x) (that is to say the right-hand side\nof (16)) decreases at increasing \u03b1, which implies a decreasing n. Conversely, when\n\u03b1 < 2 the integral I becomes \u03b1\u2212dependent and decreases with \u03b1: these dependence\ncounterbalances the reduction of the right-hand side of (16).\nFor the conserved growth model, Dx = \u2212\u2202x2 and Eq. (11) must be replaced by a\nmore complicated expression. It has not been possible to carry out a rigorous calculation\n\n\fLetter to the Editor\n\n5\n\nbecause [\u03c61 \u00d7 Dx \u0124\u03c60 \u2212 \u03c60 \u00d7 Dx \u0124\u03c61 ] is no more integrable. Nonetheless, there are\nstrong indications that the right-hand sides of (15,16) acquire a factor L\u22122 : the origin\nof this scaling factor is that \u03c60 (x) has a power-like behaviour (and therefore derivation\ncorresponds to divide by x) and also that U(x) \u223c x\u22122 . Furthermore, since we need the\nsingle well wavefunction, corresponding to a zero energy, a solution of the Schroedinger\nequation \u0124\u03c6(x) = 0 is also solution of Dx \u0124\u03c6(x) = 0.\nAs a consequence of such factor, the coarsening exponent for the conserved case is\neasily obtained from the nonconserved one: (1/n) \u2192 [(1/n) + 2]. Therefore:\n1\n1\n(1 < \u03b1 \u2264 2) and n =\n(\u03b1 > 2) . (18)\n[conserved] n =\n4\n5 \u2212 2/\u03b1\n\nIn order to check numerically the validity of the results reported in Eq.(18)\nand therefore the dependence of the coarsening exponent n on the parameter \u03b1,\ndetailed numerical simulations have been performed. In particular, we have numerically\nintegrated equation (7) by employing a pseudo-spectral time splitting code [13].\nThe values of L(t), whose log-log plot gives the exponent n, are evaluated\nthrough the power spectrum (PS) of z(x, t): the weighted average of the wavevectors\ncorresponding to the most relevant components of the PS is 2\u03c0/L(t). A different method\nusing the spatial correlation function gives consistent results. In Fig. 2, the numerical\nfindings for n(\u03b1) by direct integration of Eq. (7) are shown together with the theoretical\nexpression (18) and a good agreement is found.\nIn conclusion we have found the analytic expression for the coarsening exponents\nn(\u03b1), both for the nonconserved model, Eq. (17) and for the conserved one (growth\nmodel), Eq. (18). Coarsening varies with \u03b1 and it is not logarithmic (i.e. n = 0) even\nfor \u03b1 = \u221e.\nAcknowledgments\nWe have benefitted a lot by useful discussions with several colleagues: A.
