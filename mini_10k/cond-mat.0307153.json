Our theory is in good accord with the susceptibility data for the simple 2DES, and in excellent agreement with the two-valley Si-2DES\ndata of Shashkin et al. While g \u2217 is enhanced in GaAs, m\u2217 is enhanced in Si. The two-valley\nsusceptibility is treated within a coupled-mode (coupled-valley) approach. The coupled-valley\nmodel is confirmed by comparison with the Quantum Monte Carlo results for a 4-component\n2DES.\n\nThe 2-D electron fluid (2DES) exhibits a wealth of intriguing physics, straddling a rich\nphase diagram [1,2]. The phase diagram contains spin-polarized states at sufficiently large rs ,\nsay \u223c 20 \u2212 27. Here rs = (\u03c0n)\u22121/2 is the electron-disk radius [3, 4] at the density n, in atomic\nunits. It is also equal to the value of the coupling constant \u0393 = (potential energy)/(kinetic\nenergy). The intermediate regime rs \u223c 5 \u2212 20 also hosts many ill-understood phenomena\nincluding the metal-insulator transition (MIT) [5]. Anomalous values (e.g, see [6]), of g \u2217 and\nm\u2217 have been found. Some experiments suggest that an enhancement of g \u2217 is responsible for\nthe strong enhancement of m\u2217 g \u2217 , while results [7] on Si metal-oxide field effect transistors\n(MOSFETs) suggest that it is m\u2217 , and not g \u2217 which is enhanced. In this study we show that,\nfor ideally thin 2-D layers. g \u2217 is enhanced in GaAs-like systems, while m\u2217 is enhanced in Si-like\nmulti-valley systems. The existence of a coupled-valley state follows naturally from the physics\nof the Si system, and here we present a model leading to excellent quantitative agreement with\nexperiment, and with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of a 4-component 2DES [8].\nFermi liquid-type theories [9] are valid for rs < 1. Such perturbative methods have been\napplied, invoking impurities [10], or charge and spin-density wave effects [11]. On the other\nhand, QMC calculations of m\u2217 involve the excited states of the 2DES and are less reliable\nthan for the ground state. QMC results up to rs = 5 have been reported [12].\n(\u2217 ) E-mail:chandre@argos.phy.nrc.ca\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nWe showed recently that the 2-DES, 3-DES, and dense hydrogen can be studied using a\nmapping to a classical fluid [13\u201316]. The accuracy of the map was established by comparison\nwith QMC and other independent calculations. Here we use this classical map to evaluate m\u2217\nand g \u2217 for the low-density 2-DES. The method is best understood within a density-functional\npicture.\nThe density-functional perspective.\u2013 The Hohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theorem asserts that\nthe Helmholtz free energy F is a minimum at the true density [17]. If n(r) is the true density,\nit obeys the variational equation \u03b4F [n(r)]/\u03b4n(r) = 0. If the origin of coordinates is on an\nelectron, then if n(r) is the density as seen from this electron, it is a pair-density such that\nn(r) = n g(r). Here g(r) is the electron-pair distribution function (PDF). The variational\ncondition gives the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation as usual. Then n(r) is obtained via a sum\nover the KS orbital-densities |\u03c8i |2 weighted by the Fermi factors fi . If the electrons formed a\nclassical system, the variational equation becomes the Boltzmann form for the density:\nn(r) = ne\u2212\u03b2{Vcou (r)+Vp (r)+Vc (r)} .\n\n(1)\n\nVcou (r) is the Coulomb interaction between the electron at the origin and the electron located\nat ~r. Similarly, Vp (r) is the Poisson potential at ~r, and Vc (r) is a correlation potential.\nFor a classical system the Vxc (r) of standard KS theory is replaced by just a correlation\npotential Vc (r). In effect,Eq. 1 evaluates the g(r) of the classical fluid. However, the g(r)\nof a classical fluid is accurately given by the hyper-netted chain (HNC) inclusive of a bridge\nfunction [18]. Thus, the extended HNC equation is a classical KS equation where Vc (r) is\nthe sum of HNC+bridge diagrams. The construction of the Bridge diagrams for the 2DES is\ngiven in refs. [15, 20].\nThe classical map has no exchange, and fails as T \u2192 0. We rectify these lacunae as\nfollows. In a system without Coulomb interactions, g(r) should reduce to g 0 (r) which is\nknown analytically (at T = 0) or numerically. The first step of the mapping is to introduce\n0\na potential \u03c60ij (r) (where i, j are spion labels) such that \u03c60ij (r) generates gij\n(r) when used in\nthe HNC equation for ideal electrons [19]. This leads to an exact treatment of exchange.\nElectrons at T = 0 have kinetic energy. Hence the classical map of the quantum fluid at\nT = 0 would be at some \"quantum temperature\" Tq . This is determined by requiring the\ncorrelation energy \u01ebc of the classical fluid at Tq be equal to the \u01ebc of the quantum fluid at\nT = 0. This may be regarded as a \"calibration\" of the classical fluid to recover the quantum\nexchange-correlation energy in the rs range of interest. Here we use the \u01ebc (rs ) given by QMC\n(Tanatar-Ceperley results for the fully spin-polarized 2DES for rs up tp 30 were used in [15]).\nOnce Tq , which maps the T = 0 quantum fluid to a classical fluid is known, finite-T fluids are\ncalculated from classical fluids at the temperature Tcf = (T 2 + Tq2)1/2 , as justified in ref. [14].\nWe have shown [13, 15] that the classical PDFs are in very close agreement with the quantum\nfluid PDFs obtained via QMC. The success of the method(refs. [13\u201316]) for 2-D and 3-D\nelectrons, hydrogen fluids, and for 4-component 2-D electron fluids as judged by comparison\nwith QMC data establishes it to be a well controlled, highly reliable method. The PDFs\nare easily used in a coupling-constant integration for the exchange-correlation free energies\nFxc . Our finite-T method accurately recovers the low-T logarithmic terms in Fc which cancel\nwith corresponding terms in Fx . This method, based on a classical mapping of the quantum\ncalculation to an HNC calculation is called CHNC [1, 13\u201315].\nEvaluation of m\u2217 and g \u2217 .\u2013 The evaluation of the susceptibility enhancement m\u2217 g \u2217 uses\nthe T = 0 results for the exchange-correlation energy \u01ebxc (rs , \u03b6). This is expressed in terms of\n\u01ebxc (rs , 0) and \u01ebxc (rs , 1), and a polarization factor P (rs , \u03b6) given in Eq. (6) of Ref. [15].

Thus, at rs = 15 and 25, (Bx , Bc ) are (-0.0258, 0.0228), and (-0.0155, 0.0142).\nIf Hubbard-type finite-T RPA were used in the self-energy, the cancellation is quite poor,\neven at low-rs . These logarithmic terms and the m\u2217 have also been studied by Geldart et\nal., using CHNC [21]. Multi-valley systems- Shashkin et al. [7], also [23], have studied clean\nlow-density 2-valley 2DES in Si-MOSFETs. The two valleys are assumed degenerate [24]. It\nis found [7] that the m\u2217 is strongly enhanced, while g \u2217 shows little change. The enhanced m\u2217\nis independent of \u03b6. These results, \"contrary to normal expectations\", are reproduced by our\ncoupled-mode theory of two valleys.\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nuv\nTwo equivalent valleys and two spins imply 10 different PDFs, gij\n, where u, v are valley\nindices. Such a calculation for each rs , \u03b6, T and many values of the coupling constant is\nlaborious. A simpler procedure using just three PDFs is possible. Even if \u03b6 6= 0, each valley\nhas a density n/2. Thus the 2-valley system may be made up from the known properties of the\none-valley (two-spin) 2DESs coupled together by their Coulomb interaction. The individual\n1-valley correlation free energies Fcu , Fcv are known from QMC and CHNC results. The intervalley term for a system with a total density n, and valley densities n/2 is not known. Here\nwe present a simple approximation validated by calculating the 2-valley compressibility in\nthe same way and comparing with the QMC data of Conti et al [8]. There is no exchange\ninteraction between up-spin and down-spin electrons in the one-valley system, and the spin\ndensities are n/2 at \u03b6 = 0. Hence, since Fcu (n/2), Fcv (n/2), and Fc (n, \u03b6 = 0, [g12 ]) for the\none-valley system are known, we build up the 2-valley system within the assumption that\nFc (n, \u03b6 = 0) can be used for the inter-valley contribution to the Fc of the 4-component (i.e.,\n2-valley) system. In a full 4-component CHNC calculation, the inter-valley interaction is\nswitched on via a coupling constant integration. This effect can be recovered within linear\nresponse by developing the coupled-mode 2-valley response functions. An analogous coupledmode problem arises in electron-hole systems (see Vashishta et al [22]).\nThe total (spin or charge) density-fluctuation spectrum of the electrons in a given (single)\nvalley v is described by the response functions \u03c7v = \u03c70v /Dv , where \u03c70v is the 2-D Lindhard\nfunction weighted appropriately with the square of the Bohr magneton \u03bcB or unity, and Dv is\na corresponding denominator for each case. The Pauli susceptibility \u03c7P is the long-wavelength\nlimit \u03bc2B \u03c70v (k = 0). Let us consider a denominator of a response function (which may be the\ncharge response \u03c7, the proper polarization function \u03a0, or the spin susceptibility \u03c7s , depending\non how the local-field factor Gv is specified). The denominator Dv = 1 \u2212 vcou (1 \u2212 Gv )\u03c70v and\ndefines Gv , the local-field factor (LFF, see [26]). We are only concerned with the static k \u2192 0\nlimit. Then Gv for \u03a0 are related to K 0 /K, while the Gv for \u03c7s is given by \u03c7P /\u03c7s , as in Eq. 2,\nand depends on the correlation free energy Fc of the one-valley 2DES. When two such 2DESs,\ndescribed by \u03c7v and \u03c7u interact via the inter-valley term, coupled modes are formed. These\nmodes are described by the zeros of a new denominator of the response function of the total\n2-valley system. This coupled-mode form is [22]:\n2\n\u03c7cm = [\u03c70u + \u03c70v + vcou\n\u03c70u \u03c70v (\u03a3Guv )]/Dcm\n\u03a3Guv = Gu + Gv \u2212 Guv \u2212 Gvu\n2\nDcm = Du Dv \u2212 vcou\n\u03c70u \u03c70v (1 \u2212 Guv )(1 \u2212 Gvu )\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nHere Guv is an LFF arising from the inter-valley term Fuv already discussed, and modeled\nby F12 (n, \u03b6 = 0) at k = 0. Hence we express the susceptibility enhancement \u03c7s /\u03c7P as\n\u03c7cm /\u03c7P , and this is evaluated from the Gu , Gv and Guv . Equation 2 determines Gu = Gv ,\n2 2 v\nwhere the correlation part involves the second derivative (rsv\nd Fc /d\u03b6 2 ). Similarly the cross\n2 2 c\n2\nterm Guv involves rs d F12 (n, \u03b6 = 0)/d\u03b6 . The 4-component QMC results of Ref. [8] for\nFc (rs , \u03b6 = 0, T = 0) enable us to calculate the compressibility ratio K 0 /K of the 2-valley\nsystem directly. The coupled-mode theory, applied to the proper polarization function \u03a0\ngives another evaluation K 0 /K. The agreement between the two methods is shown in Fig. 1.\nA similar comparison for \u03c7P /\u03c7s is not possible as the QMC results are available only at\n\u03b6 = 0. However, the agreement between the two estimates of K 0 /K validates our coupledmode evaluation of 2-valley properties from the 1-valley energies. Thus the 2-valley results\nare constructed from the 1-valley CHNC energies (which argee closely with QMC data) which\ninclude the usual bridge contributions [15].\nResults\u2013 In Fig. 2 we show \u03c7s /\u03c7P = m\u2217 g \u2217 for a single-valley system, as a function of the\n\n\fM.W.C. Dharma-wardana: The effective mass and the g-factor\n\n5\n\ndensity n, and as a function of rs (see [3]) at T = 0 for \u03b6 = 0. Our results, the experimental\ndata of Zhu et al. [6], and QMC data, extracted from Fig. 2 of ref. [2] are displayed. The high\ndensity regime [27] is in agreement with standard theories and is not displayed.\nFor the Zhu et al. data we use their fitted form m\u2217 g \u2217 = (2.73 + 3.9 n \u03b6) n\u22120.4 where the\ndensity n is in units of 1010 cm\u22122 . The strong agreement between CHNC and the Zhu data\nis perhaps fortuitous since the results are quite sensitivity to the d2 /d\u03b6 2 calculation to the\nenergy differences \u2206E = Ec (\u03b6 = 1) \u2212 Ec (\u03b6 = 0) and the form of the polarization factor\nP (rs , \u03b6). The CHNC is calibrated to the Tenatar-Ceperley QMC which differs somewhat\nfrom the Attaccalite data. We have also plotted two CHNC curves where (see Eq.2) the term\nrs2 \u2202 2 \u01ebxc /\u2202\u03b6 2 has been modified by \u00b1 2%. Clearly, errors in converting to rs , modification of\nexchange-correlation gradients by well-width effects and the presence of impurities etc., can\nproduce such a change. The bottom panel (Fig. 2) shows the comparison against rs .\nZhu et al. report a \u03b6 dependence, but now they consider that the finiteness of the 2-D layer\nand orbital effects cannot be ignored in analysing field-dependent data [28]. As pointed out\nvia the \u00b12% plots in Fig.2, the sensitivity of \u03c7P /\u03c7s to small errors in the xc-energy gradient\nis also important. (Discussion of these and other data for m\u2217 and g \u2217 , of Zhu's thesis [6] will\nawait their publication).\nIn our results, \u03c7s /\u03c7P is less sensitive to \u03b6 at high density, and very sensitive to \u03b6 at low\ndensity, approaching the para\u2192ferro transition. In fact, the second derivative in Eq.2 diverges\nat \u03b6 = 1.\nA very different experimental picture is found in Si-2DESs [7]. The CHNC results for the\ncoupled 2-valley 2DES are shown in Fig. 3. The top panel compares the m\u2217 g \u2217 = \u03c7cm /\u03c7P\nobtained from experiment and the coupled-mode analysis (the LFFS used are for the spin-spin\nresponse). The inset shows the shift of the simple uncoupled-valley curve to higher densities\nwhen the valley coupling is introduced. The conversion between density and rs is discussed\nin ref. [3].\nThe middle panel (fig. 3) shows the m\u2217 calculated from the finite-T analysis, with the\nsharp rise occurring at rs \u223c 5.4, i.e., density ncv = 1x1011 /cm2 . The inset shows the lack of\n\u03b6 dependence in m\u2217 for three densities. This is because the physics is dominated by singlet\ninteractions, as in the ambi-spin phase reported earlier [1]. The lower panel of Fig. 3 shows\nthe flat g \u2217 of the coupled-valley fluid, while the inset shows the usual increase of g \u2217 in the\nuncoupled system as the density is reduced.\nConclusion\u2013 We have presented results for the effective mass m\u2217 , and the Land\u00e9 g \u2217 factor\nof 2-D electron fluids, using an analytic method. Our results suggest that exchange effects\ndominate as rs increases in 1-valley 2D system, enhancing g \u2217 when the one-valley spin-response\ndiverges. Correlation effects outweigh exchange in 2-valley systems where m\u2217 is strongly\nenhanced and only weakly dependent on \u03b6. The tendency to form singlets already noted in\nthe single 2DES [25] becomes stronger in the 2-valley 2DES where a coupled-valley state is\nformed. Our theoretical results depend only on the \u01ebxc (rs , \u03b6, T ) used in calculating \u03b6 and T\nderivatives, and invoke no fit parameters specific to this problem. However, the inter-valley\nenergy Fuv was approximated via the F12 (\u03b6 = 0) of the one-valley inter-spin energy. As\nalready noted, \u03c7/\u03c70 is quite sensitive to the evaluation of d2 /d\u03b6 2 . However, the agreement\nof the present model with experiment may prove useful in understanding the experimental\nresults.\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nWe thank Peter Coleridge, Wally Geldart, Fran\u00e7ois Perrot, Sasha Shashkin, Horst Stormer\nand Jun Zhu for their comments and correspondence.\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n10\n\n-2\n\ndensity n (10 cm )\n1\n\n8\n\n3\n\n2\n\nExpt., Zhu et al.\nCHNC\n\u03b6=0\nQMC\n\u03b6=0\nCHNC +2%\u03b6=0\nCHNC -2% \u03b6=0\n\n* *\n\n6\n\n\u03c7s/\u03c7P=m g\n\n4\n\n4\n2\n\nmg\n\n* *\n\n6\n\n4\n\u03b6=0, .4, .8, CHNC\n\u03b6=0, Expt., Zhu et al.\n\n2\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nrs (atomic units)\n\nFig. 2 \u2013 The spin-susceptibility enhancement \u03c7s /\u03c7P = m\u2217 g \u2217 in the 2DES.
