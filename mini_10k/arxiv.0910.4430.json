Introduction\nThe classification of associative algebras was instituted by Benjamin Peirce in\nthe 1870's [12], who gave a partial classification of the complex associative algebras\nof dimension up to 6, although in some sense, one can deduce the complete classification from his results, with some additional work. The classification method\nrelied on the following remarkable fact:\nTheorem 1.1. Every finite dimensional algebra which is not nilpotent contains a\nnontrivial idempotent element.\nA nilpotent algebra A is one which satisfies An = 0 for some n, while an idempotent element a satisfies a2 = a. This observation of Peirce eventually leads to two\nimportant theorems in the classification of finite dimensional associative algebras.\nRecall that an algebra is said to be simple if it has no nontrivial proper ideals, and\nit is not the 1-dimensional nilpotent algebra over K, given by the trivial product.\nTheorem 1.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Finite Dimensional Associative Algebras). Suppose that A is a finite dimensional algebra over a field K. Then A has a\nmaximal nilpotent ideal N , called its radical. If A is not nilpotent, then A/N is a\nsemisimple algebra, that is, a direct sum of simple algebras.\nMoreover, when A/N satisfies a property called separability over K, then A\nis a semidirect product of its radical and a semisimple algebra. Over the complex\nnumbers, every semisimple algebra is separable. To apply this theorem to construct\nalgebras by extension, one uses the following characterization of simple algebras.\nDate: November 19, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14D15,13D10,14B12,16S80,16E40,\n17B55,17B70.\nKey words and phrases. Versal Deformations, associative Algebras.\nResearch of these authors was partially supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDECLEENE, OTTO, PENKAVA, PHILLIPSON, STEINBACH, AND WEBER\n\nTheorem 1.3 (Wedderburn). If A is a finite dimensional algebra over K, then A\nis simple iff A is isomorphic to a tensor product M \u2297 D, where M = gl(n, K) and\nD is a division algebra over K.\nIn the nongraded case, a division algebra is a unital algebra where every nonzero\nelement has a multiplicative inverse. For Z2 -graded associative algebras, the situation is a bit more complicated. First, we need to consider graded ideals, so that\na Z2 -graded algebra is simple when it has no proper nontrivial graded ideals. Secondly, the definition of a division algebra needs to be changed as well, in order\nto generalize Wedderburn's theorem to the Z2 -graded case. A Z2 -graded division\nalgebra is a division algebra when every nonzero homogeneous element is invertible.\nWith these changes, the Fundamental Theorem remains the same, except that the\nradical is the maximal graded nilpotent ideal, and Wedderburn's theorem is also\ntrue, if we understand that by a matrix algebra, we mean the general linear algebra\nof a Z2 -graded vector space.\nIn this paper, we shall be concerned with the moduli space of associative algebras\non a Z2 -graded algebra A of dimension 2|1, so that A0 has dimension 2 and A1 has\ndimension 1. However, we recall that this space coincides with the equivalence of\nodd codifferentials of degree 2 on the parity reversion W = \u03a0A, which has dimension\n1|2, so in this paper, we shall study codifferentials on a space of dimension 1|2, but\nthe reader should keep in mind that this corresponds to associative algebras on a\n2|1-dimensional space.\nThe main goal of this paper is to give a complete description of the moduli space\nof 2|1-dimensional associative algebras, including a computation of the miniversal\ndeformation of every element.\n2. Construction of algebras by extensions\nIn [3], the theory of extensions of an algebra W by an algebra M is described in\nthe language of codifferentials. Consider the diagram\n0\u2192M \u2192V \u2192W \u21920\nof associative K-algebras, so that V = M \u2295 W as a K-vector space, M is an ideal\nin the algebra V , and W = V /M is the quotient algebra. Suppose that \u03b4 \u2208 C 2 (W )\nand \u03bc \u2208 C 2 (M ) represent the algebra structures on W and M respectively. We\ncan view \u03bc and \u03b4 as elements of C 2 (V ). Let T k,l be the subspace of T k+l (V ) given\nrecursively by T 0,0 = K,\nT k,l = M \u2297 T k\u22121,l \u2295 V \u2297 T k,l\u22121 .\nLet C k,l = Hom(T k,l , M ) \u2286 C k+l (V ). If we denote the algebra structure on V by\nd, we have\nd = \u03b4 + \u03bc + \u03bb + \u03c8,\nwhere \u03bb \u2208 C 1,1 and \u03c8 \u2208 C 0,2 . Note that in this notation, \u03bc \u2208 C 2,0 . Then the\ncondition that d is associative: [d, d] = 0 gives the following relations:\n[\u03b4, \u03bb] + 21 [\u03bb, \u03bb] + [\u03bc, \u03c8] = 0,\n[\u03bc, \u03bb] = 0,\n[\u03b4 + \u03bb, \u03c8] = 0,\n\nThe Maurer-Cartan equation\nThe compatibility condition\nThe cocycle condition\n\n\fTHE MODULI SPACE OF 2|1-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nSince \u03bc is an algebra structure, [\u03bc, \u03bc] = 0, so if we define D\u03bc by D\u03bc (\u03c6) = [\u03bc, \u03c6],\nthen D\u03bc2 = 0. Thus D\u03bc is a differential on C(V ). Moreover D\u03bc : C k,l \u2192 C k+1,l .\nLet\nZ\u03bck,l = ker(D\u03bc : C k,l \u2192 C k+1,l ),\n\nthe (k, l)-cocycles\n\nB\u03bck,l\nH\u03bck,l\n\nthe (k, l)-coboundaries\n\n= Im(D\u03bc : C\n= Z\u03bck,l /B\u03bck,l ,\n\nk\u22121,l\n\n\u2192C\n\nk,l\n\n),\n\nthe Du (k, l)-cohomology\n\nThen the compatibility condition means that \u03bb \u2208 Z 1,1 . If we define D\u03b4+\u03bb (\u03c6) =\n2\n[\u03b4 + \u03bb, \u03c6], then it is not true that D\u03b4+\u03bb\n= 0, but D\u03b4+\u03bb D\u03bc = \u2212D\u03bc D\u03b4+\u03bb , so that\nk,l\nD\u03b4+\u03bb descends to a map D\u03b4+\u03bb : H\u03bc \u2192 H\u03bck,l+1 , whose square is zero, giving rise\nk,l\nto the D\u03b4+\u03bb -cohomology H\u03bc,\u03b4+\u03bb\n. If the pair (\u03bb, \u03c8) give rise to a codifferential d,\n\u2032\nand (\u03bb, \u03c8 ) give rise to another codifferential d\u2032 , then if we express \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 + \u03c4 , it is\neasy to see that [\u03bc, \u03c4 ] = 0, and [\u03b4 + \u03bb, \u03c4 ] = 0, so that the image \u03c4\u0304 of \u03c4 in H\u03bc0,2 is a\n0,2\nD\u03b4+\u03bb -cocycle, and thus \u03c4 determines an element {\u03c4\u0304 } \u2208 H\u03bc,\u03b4+\u03bb\n.\nIf \u03b2 \u2208 C 0,1 , then g = exp(\u03b2) : T (V ) \u2192 T (V ) is given by g(m, w) = (m +\n\u03b2(w), w). Furthermore g \u2217 = exp(\u2212 ad\u03b2 ) : C(V ) \u2192 C(V ) satisfies g \u2217 (d) = d\u2032 , where\nd\u2032 = \u03b4 + \u03bc + \u03bb\u2032 + \u03c8 \u2032 with\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb + [\u03bc, \u03b2]\n\u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 + [\u03b4 + \u03bb + 21 [\u03bc, \u03b2], \u03b2],\nIn this case, we say that d and d\u2032 are equivalent extensions in the restricted sense.\nSuch equivalent extensions are also equivalent as codifferentials on T (V ). Note\nthat \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 differ by a D\u03bc -coboundary, so \u03bb\u0304 = \u03bb\u0304\u2032 in H\u03bc1,1 . If \u03bb satisfies the MCequation for some \u03c8, then any any element \u03bb\u2032 in \u03bb\u0304 also gives a solution of the MC\nequation, for the \u03c8 \u2032 given above. The cohomology classes of those \u03bb for which a\nsolution of the MC equation exists determine distinct restricted equivalence classes\nof extensions.\nLet GM,W = GL(M ) \u00d7 GL(W ) \u2286 GL(V ). If g \u2208 GM,W then g \u2217 : C k,l \u2192 C k,l ,\nand g \u2217 : C k (W ) \u2192 C k (W ), so \u03b4 \u2032 = g \u2217 (\u03b4) and \u03bc\u2032 = g \u2217 (\u03bc) are codifferentials on\nT (M ) and T (W ) respectively. The group G\u03b4,\u03bc is the subgroup of GM,W consisting\nof those elements g such that g \u2217 (\u03b4) = \u03b4 and g \u2217 (\u03bc) = \u03bc. Then G\u03b4,\u03bc acts on the\nrestricted equivalence classes of extensions, giving the equivalence classes of general\nextensions. Also, G\u03b4,\u03bc acts on H\u03bck,l , and induces an action on the classes \u03bb\u0304 of \u03bb\ngiving a solution (\u03bb, \u03c8) to the MC equation.\nNext, consider the group G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb consisting of the automorphisms h of V of the\nform h = g exp(\u03b2), where g \u2208 G\u03b4,\u03bc , \u03b2 \u2208 C 0,1 and \u03bb = g \u2217 (\u03bb) + [\u03bc, \u03b2]. If d =\n\u03b4 + \u03bc + \u03bb + \u03c8 + \u03c4 , then h\u2217 (d) = \u03b4 + \u03bc + \u03bb + \u03c8 + \u03c4 \u2032 where\n\u03c4 \u2032 = g \u2217 (\u03c8) \u2212 \u03c8 + [\u03b4 + \u03bb \u2212 21 [\u03bc, \u03b2], \u03b2] + g \u2217 (\u03c4 ).\n0,2\nMoreover, the group G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb induces an action on H\u03bc,\u03b4+\u03bb\ngiven by {\u03c4\u0304 } \u2192 {\u03c4 \u2032 }. In\n\u2217\nfact, {g (\u03c4 )} is well defined as well, and depends only on {\u03c4\u0304 }.\nThe general group of equivalences of extensions of the algebra structure \u03b4 on\nW by the algebra structure \u03bc on M is given by the group of automorphisms of V\nof the form h = exp(\u03b2)g, where \u03b2 \u2208 C 0,1 and g \u2208 G\u03b4,\u03bc . We have the following\nclassification of such extensions up to equivalence.\n\n\f4\n\nDECLEENE, OTTO, PENKAVA, PHILLIPSON, STEINBACH, AND WEBER\n\nTheorem 2.1. The equivalence classes of extensions of \u03b4 on W by \u03bc on M is\nclassified by the following:\n(1) Equivalence classes of \u03bb\u0304 \u2208 H\u03bc1,1 which satisfy the MC equation\n[\u03b4, \u03bb] + 21 [\u03bb, \u03bb] + [\u03bc, \u03c8] = 0\nfor some \u03c8 \u2208 C 0,2 , under the action of the group G\u03b4,\u03bc .\n0,2\n(2) Equivalence classes of {\u03c4\u0304 } \u2208 H\u03bc,\u03b4+\u03bb\nunder the action of the group G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb .\nEquivalent extensions will give rise to equivalent codifferentials on V , but it may\nhappen that two codifferentials arising from nonequivalent extensions are equivalent. This is because the group of equivalences of extensions is the group of invertible block upper triangular matrices on the space V = M \u2295 W , whereas the the\nequivalence classes of codifferentials on V are given by the group of all invertible\nmatrices, which is larger.\nThe fundamental theorem of finite dimensional algebras allows us to restrict our\nconsideration of extensions to two cases. First, we can consider those extensions\nwhere \u03b4 is a semisimple algebra structure on W , and \u03bc is a nilpotent algebra\nstructure on M . In this case, because we are working over C, we can also assume\nthat \u03c8 = \u03c4 = 0. Thus the classification of the extension reduces to considering\nequivalence classes of \u03bb.\nSecondly, we can consider extensions of the trivial algebra structure \u03b4 = 0 on\na 1-dimensional space W by a nilpotent algebra \u03bc. This is because a nilpotent\nalgebra has a codimension 1 ideal M , and the restriction of the algebra structure to\nM is nilpotent. However, in this case, we cannot assume that \u03c8 or \u03c4 vanish, so we\nneed to use the classification theorem above to determine the equivalence classes of\nextensions. In many cases, in solving the MC equation for a particular \u03bb, if there\nis any \u03c6 yielding a solution, then \u03c8 = 0 also gives a solution, so the action of G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb\non H\u03bc0,2 takes on a simpler form than the general action we described above. In\nfact, if in addition to \u03c8 = 0 providing a solution to the MC equation, any element\n0,2\nh = g exp(\u03b2) satisfies [\u03bc, \u03b2] = 0, then the action of h on H\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb\nis just the action\n\u2217\n\u2217\ng ({\u03c4\u0304 }) = {g (\u03c4 )}, which is easy to calculate in practice.\n3. Associative algebra structures on a 2|1 vector space\nLet A be a 2|1-dimensional vector space, and V = \u03a0A be the parity reversion\nof A, so that V is 1|2-dimensional. Let {v1 , v2 , v3 } be a basis of V with v1 an even\nelement and v2 , v3 odd elements and d be a codifferential on V representing an\nassociative algebra structure on A.\nBy results in [1], there are only two Z2 -graded division algebras, the complex\nnumbers, and a certain 1|1-dimensional algebra. As a consequence, there are no\n2|1-dimensional simple algebras, so we can express V as an extension of an algebra\nstructure \u03b4 on W by an algebra structure \u03bc on M , where V = M \u2295 W , and M is\nan ideal in V .\nBy the fundamental theorem of finite dimensional associative algebras, we can\nassume that \u03bc is a nilpotent algebra structure on M . Moreover, \u03b4 is a semisimple\nalgebra structure on W , unless d is a nilpotent algebra structure.\nSince every nilpotent algebra has a codimension 1 ideal, if d is nilpotent, we can\nassume that W is 1-dimensional (either even or odd), and that \u03b4 = 0. The only\nsemisimple algebras we need to consider are the simple 1|1-dimensional algebra, and\n\n\fTHE MODULI SPACE OF 2|1-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nthe semisimple 0|2-dimensional algebra. Moreover, when considering extensions of\na semisimple algebra, the \"cocycle\" \u03c8 can be taken to be zero, because we are\nconsidering extensions over C, for which every semisimple algebra is separable.\nNow,suppose that W = hvw(1) , * * * , vw(p) i where the first s vectors are even and\nthe other p \u2212 s elements are odd, and that M = hvm(1) , * * * , vm(q) i, where the first\nt elements are even and the other q \u2212 t elements are odd. (This conforms to the\nprinciple that in a Z2 -graded space, a basis should be listed with the even elements\nfirst.) Then a formula for an arbitrary \u03bb \u2208 C 1,1 is of the form\nX\nm(j)w(k)\nw(k)m(j)\n(REk )ij\n(LEk )ij + \u03c8m(i)\n\u03c8m(i)\n\u03bb=\n|vw(k) |=1\n\nX\n\n+\n\nw(k)m(j)\n\n\u03c8m(i)\n\nm(j)w(k)\n\n(LOk )ij + \u03c8m(i)\n\n(ROk )ij ,\n\n|vw(k) |=0\n\nwhere LEk and REk are matrices of even maps M \u2192 M , and LOk and ROk are\ni\nmatrices of odd maps M \u2192 M . For simplicity, we shall denote (LEk )iJ as LEkj\nand similarly for the components of the other matrices. Let Lk = LEk + LOk and\nRk = REk + ROk . Then\n1\n2 [\u03bb, \u03bb]\n\nw(k)w(l)m(j)\n\n= \u03c8m(i)\n\nw(k)m(j)w(l)\n\n+ \u03c8w(i)\n\nm(j)w(k)w(l)\n\n((LOk \u2212 LEk )Ll ))ij + \u03c8m(i)\n\n(Rl Rk )ij\n\n(Rl Lk + (LOk \u2212 LEk )Rl ).\n\nIt is important to note that the formula above is given in terms of matrix multiplication. This is significant from the computational view as we shall illustrate below.\nIt is interesting to note that matrices in GM,W , which are block diagonal maps\ndiag(G1 , G2 ), where G1 \u2208 GL(M ) and G2 \u2208 GL(W ), act on \u03bb in a manner which\ncan be described in terms of the matrices above. First, G1 acts by conjugating all\nthe matrices Lk and Rk simultaneously. Secondly, the matrix G2 acts on the k\nindices. We shall say more about these actions later.\nLet us give one concrete application of the remarks above. Suppose that W is\ncompletely odd, and M is r|s-dimensional. Then we can express M = hv1 , * * * , vr+s i\nand W = hvr+s+1 , * * * , vr+s+n i. In this case Lk = LEk and Rk = REk . We\ncan express Rk = diag(Tk , Bk ), where Tk : M0 \u2192 M0 and Bk : M1 \u2192 M1 and\nM = M0 \u2295 M1 represents the decomposition of M into its even and odd parts.\nThen we have\n1\n2 [\u03bb, \u03bb]\n\nLet \u03b4 =\n\nPr+s+n\n\n= \u2212\u03c8iklj (Lk Ll )ij + \u03c8ikjl (Rl Lk \u2212 Lk Rl )ij + \u03c8ijkl (Rl Rk )ij .\n\nk=r+s+1\n\n\u03c8kkk be the codifferential semisimple algebra Cn . Then\n[\u03b4, \u03bb] = \u03c8ikkj (Lk )ij + (\u22121)j \u03c8ijkk (Rk )ij .\n\nWhen considering an extension of the algebra Cn by an algebra structure on M ,\nwe can assume that the cocycle \"\u03c8\" vanishes, so the MC equation is just [\u03b4, \u03bb] +\n1\n2 [\u03bb, \u03bb] = 0, which is equivalent to the following:\nLk = L2k , Lk Ll = 0, if k 6= l\nLk Rl = Rl Lk\nTk =\n\n\u2212Tk2,\n\nBk =Bk2 ,\n\nRk Rl = 0, if k 6= l.\n\n\f6\n\nDECLEENE, OTTO, PENKAVA, PHILLIPSON, STEINBACH, AND WEBER\n\nAs a consequence, the matrices above give a commuting set of diagonalizable matrices, so they can be simultaneously diagonalized. Moreover, Lk and Bk have\nonly 0 and 1 as possible eigenvalues and Tk has only 0 and \u22121 as possible eigenvalues. If we consider \u03bc = 0 as the algebra structure on M , then the elements\ndiag(G1 , G2 ) \u2208 G\u03b4,\u03bc are given by an arbitrary matrix G1 and G2 is just a permutation matrix.\nThus we can apply an element G \u2208 G\u03b4,\u03bc to \u03bb to put it in the form where all\nthe matrices are diagonal, and are ordered in such a manner that the nonzero Lk\nmatrices appear first. Moreover, since the Lk matrices are orthogonal to each other,\nthere are at most m = r + s nonzero L matrices.\nSimilar considerations apply to the R matrices, so that in total, there can be\nno more than 2m pairs (Lk , Rk ), such that at least one matrix does not vanish.\nTherefore, when n \u2265 2m, the number of distinct equivalence classes of extensions\nof Cn by a trivial algebra structure on M is exactly equal to 2m.\nWe say that this is the stable situation. The number of extensions is independent\nof n as long as it is at least 2m. Moreover, the cohomology and deformation theory\nalso becomes stable, in a natural way. When \u03bc 6= 0, the situation is a bit more\ncomplicated, but there is also an n beyond which the situation becomes stable.\nWe now give a construction of the elements in the moduli space of 1|2-dimensional\ncodifferentials. Table 3 below gives the cohomology of the 28 nonequivalent codifferentials.\n4. Extensions where W is 1|1-dimensional and M is 0|1-dimensional\nLet W = hv1 , v3 i and M = hv2 i. The unique 1|1-dimensional simple algebra\nis given by the codifferential \u03b4 = \u03c8113 \u2212 \u03c8131 + \u03c8311 \u2212 \u03c8333 . Then the of \u03b4 with the\nsimple 0|1-dimensional algebra \u03bc = \u03c8222 gives the unique semisimple 1|2 dimension\nd1 . Now consider the extensions of \u03b4 by the trivial 0|1-dimensional algebra \u03bc = 0.\n1\n1\n. However,\n+ \u03c8223 RE21\nThe generic lambda is of the form \u03bb = \u03c8232 LE21\n1\n211\n1\n332\n1\n233\n1\n[\u03b4, \u03bb] = \u03c6112\n2 LE21 \u2212 \u03c62 RE21 \u2212 \u03c62 LE21 + \u03c62 RE21\n1\n2 [\u03bb, \u03bb]\n\n1 2\n233\n1 2\n= \u2212\u03c6332\n2 (LE21 ) + \u03c62 (RE21 )\n\nso the MC equation forces \u03bb = 0. Therefore, the unique extension of \u03b4 is the direct\nsum of \u03b4 and the trivial 1-dimensional algebra, which is the codifferential d2 .\n5. Extensions where W is 0|2-dimensional and M is 1|0-dimensional\nLet W = hv2 , v3 i be 0|2-dimensional and M = hv1 i be 1|0-dimensional. The only\nsemisimple algebra structure on W is given by \u03b4 = \u03c8333 + \u03c8222 , and the only algebra\nstructure on M is \u03bc = 0. This case is an example of the general case of extending\nthe semisimple algebra structure C2 by the trivial algebra structure on M .

Thus we have to take\ninto account extensions by both the nontrivial and the trivial algebra structure on\nM.\n6.0.1. Extensions of the simple 0|1-dimensional algebra. In this case \u03b4 = \u03c8333 . First,\nwe consider the extensions by the nontrivial algebra \u03bc = \u03c8211 . Then G\u03bc,\u03b4 consists\nof the diagonal matrices of the form G = diag r, r2 , 1, with r 6= 0. Now [\u03bc, \u03bb] = 0\n2\n2\nprecisely when L111 = L212 = R12\n= \u2212R11\n. In other words, L1 = diag(L111 , L111 ) and\n1\n1\nR1 = diag(\u2212L11 , L11 ). Since we already know by the MC equation that the eigenvalues of L1 are either 0 or 1, this gives exactly two codifferentials, corresponding\nto d8 and d9 .\nNext suppose that \u03bc = 0. Then L1 is either I, diag(1, 0), diag(0, 1) or 0, while\nR1 is either diag(\u22121, 1), diag(\u22121, 0) diag(0, 1) or 0. Since these conditions are independent, there are a total of 16 different solutions, giving rise to the codifferentials\nd10 through d25 .\n6.0.2. Extensions of the trivial 0|1-dimensional algebra. . In this case, \u03b4 = 0. Let\nus first consider the extensions by the nontrivial nilpotent algebra \u03bc = \u03c8211 . Then\nG\u03b4,\u03bc consists of diagonal matrices of the form G = diag(r, r2 , t), where rt 6= 0. The\nMC equation yields \u03bb = 0, and it places no condition on \u03c8, so we can take \u03c8 = 0.\n0,2\nThen we need to compute H\u03bc,\u03b4+\u03bb\n, which is spanned by \u03c8133 . If we let \u03c4 = \u03c8133 c,\nthen consider the action of G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb = G\u03b4,\u03bc on \u03c4 ,and we obtain g \u2217 (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2217 t, when\nG = diag(r, r2 , t). Therefore, we can reduce to the cases when t = 1, which gives\nd26 and t = 0, which gives d27 . These two algebras are nilpotent.\nNext, consider the case \u03bc = 0. Then G\u03b4,\u03bc = GM,W . As in the previous case,\nwe obtain \u03bb = 0, \u03c4 = \u03c8133 c, and the action of G\u03b4,\u03bc,\u03bb allows us to consider only the\ncases c = 1, which gives d28 , and c = 0, which gives the zero codifferential.\n7. Extensions where M is 0|2-dimensional and W is 1|0-dimensional\nWe have M = hhv2 , v3ii and W = hv1 i. The group GM,W consists of matrices\n0\n, where G\u0303 \u2208 GL(2, C). In this case we have \u03b4 = 0 and\nof the form G = g011 G\u0303\n\n\u03bb = 0. Moreover C 0,2 = h\u03c8211 , \u03c8311 i. There are two possibilities for \u03bc, the trivial\ncodifferential and \u03bc = \u03c8233 .\nLet us consider the nontrivial\ncase \u0015for \u03bc first. Then G\u03b4,\u03bc is given by the matrices\n\u0014\nin GM,W such that G\u0303 =\n\ng3,3 2 g2,3\n0\n\ng3,3\n\n. Let \u03c8 = \u03c8211 c1 + \u03c8311 c2 . Then the MC\n\nequation reduces to [\u03bc, \u03c8] = 0, which forces c2 = 0. Therefore, we can set \u03c8 = 0\nand \u03c4 = \u03c8211 c1 . Now let g be an element of G\u03b4,\u03bc , given by the matrix G above.\ng2\n\n11\nThen g \u2217 (\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 \u2217 g1,1\nand \u03c4 = 0. The\n2 , so we need only consider the cases \u03c4 = \u03c82\n3,3\nfirst one duplicates the codifferential d26 while the second duplicates d28 .\nFinally, consider the case \u03bc = 0. Then G\u03b4,\u03bc = GM,W . There is no condition on\n\u03c8, so we can take \u03c8 = 0 and \u03c4 = \u03c8211 t1 + \u03c8311 t2 . If we represent \u03c4 by the column\nvector [t1 , t2 ]T , then the action of an element g on \u03c4 is given by T 7\u2192 g1,1 G\u0303\u22121 T .\nThis means we can reduce to the case where \u03c4 = \u03c8211 or \u03c4 = 0. The first one is\nequivalent to d27 , already seen, and the second one is the zero codifferential.\nThus we have completed the classification of the elements in the moduli space\nof associative algebra structures on a space V of dimension 2|1, or, in other words,\nthe codifferentials on a 1|2-dimensional space.\n\n\fTHE MODULI SPACE OF 2|1-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\n8. Hochschild Cohomology and Deformations\nHochschild cohomology was introduced in [10], and used to classify infinitesimal\ndeformations of associative algebras. Suppose that\nmt = m + t\u03c6,\nis an infinitesimal deformation of m. By this we mean that the structure mt is\nassociative up to first order. From an algebraic point of view, this means that we\nassume that t2 = 0, and then check whether associativity holds. It is not difficult\nto show that is equivalent to the following.\na\u03c6(b, c) \u2212 \u03c6(ab, c) + \u03c6(a, bc) \u2212 \u03c6(a, b)c = 0,\nwhere, for simplicity, we denote m(a, b) = ab. Moreover, if we let\ngt = I + t\u03bb\nbe an infinitesimal automorphism of A, where \u03bb \u2208 Hom(A, A), then it is easily\nchecked that\ngt\u2217 (m)(a, b) = ab + t(a\u03bb(b) \u2212 \u03bb(ab) + \u03bb(a)b).\nThis naturally leads to a definition of the Hochschild coboundary operator D on\nHom(T (A), A) by\nD(\u03c6)(a0 , * * * , an ) =a0 \u03c6(a1 , * * * , an ) + (\u22121)n+1 \u03c6(a0 , * * * , an\u22121 )an\n+\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+1 \u03c6(a0 , * * * , ai\u22121 , ai ai+1 , ai+2 , * * * , an ).\n\ni=0\n\nn\n\nn\n\nIf we set C (A) = Hom(A , A), then D : C n (A) \u2192 C n+1 (A). One obtains the\nfollowing classification theorem for infinitesimal deformations.\nTheorem 8.1. The equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations mt of an associative algebra structure m under the action of the group of infinitesimal automorphisms on the set of infinitesimal deformations are classified by the Hochschild\ncohomology group\nH 2 (m) = ker(D : C 2 (A) \u2192 C 3 (A))/ Im(D : C 1 (A) \u2192 C 2 (A)).\nWhen A is Z2 -graded, the only modifications that are necessary are that \u03c6 and\n\u03bb are required to be even maps, so we obtain that the classification is given by\nHe2 (A), the even part of the Hochschild cohomology.\nWe wish to transform this classical viewpoint into the more modern viewpoint of\nassociative algebras as being given by codifferentials on a certain coalgebra. To do\nthis, we first introduce the parity reversion \u03a0A of a Z2 -graded vector space A. If\nA = Ae \u2295 Ao is the decomposition of A into its even and odd parts, then W = \u03a0A\nis the Z2 -graded vector space given by We = Ao and Wo = Ae . In other words, W\nis just the space A with the parity of elements reversed.\nL\nk\nk\nDenote the tensor (co)-algebra of W by T (W ) = \u221e\nk=0 W , where W is the\nk-th tensor power of W and W 0 = K. For brevity, the element in W k given by the\ntensor product of the elements vi in W will be denoted by v1 * * * vk .

Note that d is an\nodd map. The space C(W ) = Hom(T (W ), W ) is naturally identifiable with the\nspace of coderivations of T (W ). In fact, if \u03c6 \u2208 C k (W ) = Hom(W k , W ), then \u03c6 is\nextended to a coderivation of T (W ) by\n\u03c6(v1 * * * vn ) =\n\nn\u2212k\nX\n\n(\u22121)(v1 +***+vi )\u03c6 v1 * * * vi \u03c6(vi+1 * * * vi+k )vi+k+1 * * * vn .\n\ni=0\n\nThe space of coderivations of T (W ) is equipped with a Z2 -graded Lie algebra\nstructure given by\n[\u03c6, \u03c8] = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u2212 (\u22121)\u03c6\u03c8 \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c6.\nThe reason that it is more convenient to work with the structure d on W rather than\nm on A is that the condition of associativity for m translates into the codifferential\nproperty [d, d] = 0. Moreover, the Hochschild coboundary operation translates into\nthe coboundary operator D on C(W ), given by\nD(\u03c6) = [d, \u03c6].\nThis point of view on Hochschild cohomology first appeared in [16]. The fact that\nthe space of Hochschild cochains is equipped with a graded Lie algebra structure\nwas noticed much earlier [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nFor notational purposes, we introduce a basis of C n (W ) as follows. Suppose that\nW = hv1 , * * * , vm i. Then if I = (i1 , * * * , in ) is a multi-index, where 1 \u2264 ik \u2264 m,\ndenote vI = vi1 * * * vin . Define \u03c6Ii \u2208 C n (W ) by\n\u03c6Ii (vJ ) = \u03b4JI vi ,\nwhere \u03b4JI is the Kronecker delta symbol. In order to emphasize the parity of the\nelement, we will denote \u03c6Ii by \u03c8iI when it is an odd coderivation.\nFor a multi-index I = (i1 , * * * , ik ), denote its length by l(I) = k. If K and L are\nmulti-indices, then denote KL = (k1 , * * * , kl(K) , ll , * * * , ll(L) ). Then\nX\nJ\n(\u03c6Ii \u25e6 \u03c6Jj )(vK ) =\n(\u22121)vK1 \u03c6j \u03c6Ii (vK1 , \u03c6Jj (vK2 ), vK3 )\nK1 K2 K3 =K\n\n=\n\nX\n\nJ\n\nI\n\u03b4J v ,\n(\u22121)vK1 \u03c6j \u03b4K\n1 jK3 K2 i\n\nK1 K2 K3 =K\n\nfrom which it follows that\n(1)\n\n\u03c6Ii \u25e6 \u03c6Jj =\n\nl(I)\nX\n\nJ\n\n(I,J,k)\n\n(\u22121)(vi1 +***+vik\u22121 )\u03c6j \u03b4jk \u03c6i\n\n,\n\nk=1\n\nwhere (I, J, k) is given by inserting J into I in place of the k-th element of I; i.e.,\n(I, J, k) = (i1 , * * * , ik\u22121 , j1 , * * * , jl(J) , ik+1 , * * * , il(I) ).\nLet us recast the notion of an infinitesimal deformation in terms of the language\nof coderivations. We say that\ndt = d + t\u03c8\nis a deformation of the codifferential d precisely when [dt , dt ] = 0 mod t2 . This\ncondition immediately reduces to the cocycle condition D(\u03c8) = 0. Note that we\nrequire dt to be odd, so that \u03c8 must be an odd coderivation. One can introduce a\nmore general idea of parameters, allowing both even and odd parameters, in which\n\n\fTHE MODULI SPACE OF 2|1-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\ncase even coderivations play an equal role, but we will not adopt that point of view\nin this paper.\nFor associative algebras, we require that d and \u03c8 lie in Hom(W 2 , W ). This\nnotion naturally generalizes to considering d simply to be an arbitrary odd codifferential, in which case we would obtain an A\u221e algebra, a natural generalization of\nan associative algebra.\nMore generally, we need the notion of a versal deformation, in order to understand how the moduli space is glued together. To explain versal deformations we\nintroduce the notion of a deformation with a local base. A local base A is a Z2 graded commutative, unital K-algebra with an augmentation \u01eb : A \u2192 K, whose\nkernel m is the unique maximal ideal in A, so that A is a local ring. It follows that\nA has a unique decomposition A = K \u2295 m and \u01eb is just the projection onto the first\nfactor. Let WA = W \u2297 A equipped with the usual structure of a right\nL A-module.\nk\nLet TA (WA ) be the tensor algebra of WA over A, that is TA (WA ) = \u221e\nk=0 TA (WA )\nk+1\n0\nk\nwhere TA (WA ) = A and TA (WA ) = T (WA )A \u2297A WA . It is a standard fact that\nTAk (WA ) = T k (W ) \u2297 A in a natural manner, and thus TA (WA ) = T (W ) \u2297 A.\nAny A-linear map f : TA (W ) \u2192 TA (W ) is induced by its restriction to T (W ) \u2297\nK = T (W ) so we can view an A-linear coderivation \u03b4A on TA (WA ) as a map\n\u03b4A : T (W ) \u2192 T (W ) \u2297 A. A morphism f : A \u2192 B induces a map\nf\u2217 : CoderA (TA (WA )) \u2192 CoderB (TB (WB ))\ngiven by f\u2217 (\u03b4A ) = (1 \u2297 f )\u03b4A , moreover if \u03b4A is a codifferential then so is f\u2217 (A). A\ncodifferential dA on TA (WA ) is said to be a deformation of the codifferential d on\nT (W ) if \u01eb\u2217 (dA ) = d.\nIf dA is a deformation of d with base A then we can express\ndA = d + \u03c6\nwhere \u03c6 : T (W ) \u2192 T (W ) \u2297 m. The condition for dA to be a codifferential is the\nMaurer-Cartan equation,\n1\nD(\u03c6) + [\u03c6, \u03c6] = 0\n2\nIf m2 = 0 we say that A is an infinitesimal algebra and a deformation with base A\nis called infinitesimal.\nA typical example of an infinitesimal base is K[t]/(t2 ), moreover, the classical\nnotion of an infinitesimal deformation\ndt = d + t\u03c6\nis precisely an infinitesimal deformation with base K[t]/(t2 ).\nA local algebra A is complete if\nk\nA = lim\n\u2190\u2212 A/m\nk\n\nA complete, local augmented K-algebra will be called formal and a deformation with\na formal base is called a formal deformation. An infinitesimal base is automatically\nformal, so every infinitesimal deformation is a formal deformation.\nAn example of a formal base is A = K[[t]] and a deformation of d with base A\ncan be expressed in the form\ndt = d + t\u03c81 + t2 \u03c82 + . . .\n\n\f12\n\nDECLEENE, OTTO, PENKAVA, PHILLIPSON, STEINBACH, AND WEBER\n\nThis is the classical notion of a formal deformation. It is easy to see that the\ncondition for dt to be a formal deformation reduces to\nn\n\nD(\u03c8n+1 ) = \u2212\n\n1X\n[\u03c8k , \u03c8n+1\u2212k ]\n2\nk=1\n\nAn automorphism of WA over A is an A-linear isomorphism gA : WA \u2192 WA\nmaking the diagram below commute.

If A is infinitesimal then gA\n= I \u2212 \u03bb.\n\u2032\nTwo deformations dA and dA are said to be equivalent over A if there is an\n\u2217\nautomorphism gA of WA over A such that gA\n(dA ) = d\u2032A . In this case we write\n\u2032\ndA \u223c dA .\nAn infinitesimal deformation dA with base A is called universal if whenever dB\nis an infinitesimal deformation with base B, there is a unique morphism f : A \u2192 B\nsuch that f\u2217 (dA ) \u223c dB .\n2\nTheorem 8.2. If dim Hodd\n(d) < \u221e then there is a universal infinitesimal deformation d\u221e of d. Given by\nd\u221e = d + \u03b4 i ti\nwhere H 2 (d) = h\u03b4 \u0304i i and A = K[ti ]/(ti tj ) is the base of deformation.\nodd\n\nA formal deformation dA with base A is called versal if given any formal deformation of dB with base B there is a morphism f : A \u2192 B such that f\u2217 (dA ) \u223c dB .\nNotice that the difference between the versal and the universal property of infinitesimal deformations is that f need not be unique. A versal deformation is called\nminiversal if f is unique whenever B is infinitesimal. The basic result about versal\ndeformation is:\n2\n(d) < \u221e then a miniversal deformation of d exists.\nTheorem 8.3. If dim Hodd\n\nIn this paper we will only need the following result to compute the versal deformations.\n2\nTheorem 8.4. Suppose Hodd\n(d) = h\u03b4 \u0304i i and [\u03b4 i , \u03b4 j ] = 0 for all i, j then the infinitesimal deformation\nd\u221e = d + \u03b4 i ti\n\nis miniversal, with base A = K[[ti ]].\n\n\fTHE MODULI SPACE OF 2|1-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX ASSOCIATIVE ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nThe construction of the moduli space as a geometric object is based on the\nidea that codifferentials which can be obtained by deformations with small parameters are \"close\" to each other. From the small deformations, we can construct\n1-parameter families or even multi-parameter families, which are defined for small\nvalues of the parameters, except possibly when the parameters vanish.\nIf dt is a one parameter family of deformations, then two things can occur. First,\nit may happen that dt is equivalent to a certain codifferential d\u2032 for every small value\nof t except zero. Then we say that dt is a jump deformation from d to d\u2032 . It will\nnever occur that d\u2032 is equivalent to d, so there are no jump deformations from a\ncodifferential to itself. Otherwise, the codifferentials dt will all be nonequivalent if\nt is small enough. In this case, we say that dt is a smooth deformation.\nIn [4], it was proved for Lie algebras that given three codifferentials d, d\u2032 and d\u2032\u2032 ,\nif there are jump deformations from d to d\u2032 and from d\u2032 to d\u2032\u2032 , then there is a jump\ndeformation from d to d\u2032\u2032 . The proof of the corresponding statement for associative\nalgebras is essentially the same.\nSimilarly, if there is a jump deformation from d to d\u2032 , and a family of smooth\ndeformations d\u2032t , then there is a family dt of smooth deformations of d, such that\nevery deformation in the image of d\u2032t lies in the image of dt , for sufficiently small\nvalues of t. In this case, we say that the smooth deformation of d factors through\nthe jump deformation to d\u2032 .\nIn the examples of complex moduli spaces of Lie and associative algebras which\nwe have studied, it turns out that there is a natural stratification of the moduli space\nof n-dimensional algebras by orbifolds, where the codifferentials on a given strata are\nconnected by smooth deformations, which don't factor through jump deformations.\nThese smooth deformations determine the local neighborhood structure.\nThe strata are connected by jump deformations, in the sense that any smooth\ndeformation from a codifferential on one strata to another strata factors through\na jump deformation. Moreover, all of the strata are given by projective orbifolds.\nIn fact, in all the complex examples we have studied, the orbifolds either are single\npoints, or CPn quotiented out by either \u03a3n+1 or a subgroup, acting on CPn by\npermuting the coordinates.\nWe don't have a concrete proof at this time, but we conjecture that this pattern\nholds in general. In other words, we believe the following conjecture.\nConjecture 8.5 (Fialowski-Penkava). The moduli space of Lie or associative algebras of a fixed finite dimension n are stratified by projective orbifolds, with jump\ndeformations and smooth deformations factoring through jump deformations providing the only deformations between the strata.\n9.

On the surface t2 = t4 , except on the lines\nt2 = 0 and t1 = 0, the deformation is equivalent to d2 . On the surface t1 = 0,\nexcept on the lines t4 = t2 , t4 = 0 and t4 = t2 /2, the deformation is equivalent to\nd6 . On the surface t4 = t2 /2, except on the lines t1 = 0 and t2 = 0, the deformation\nis equivalent to d8 . On the surface t4 = 0, except on the lines t1 = 0 and t2 = 0,\nthe deformation is equivalent to d9 . On the line t4 = t2 , t1 = 0, the deformation\njumps to d23 . On the line t4 = t2 /2, t1 = 0, the deformation jumps to d24 . On the\nline t4 = t1 = 0, the deformation jumps to d25 . Finally, on the line t2 = t4 = 0, the\ndeformation jumps to d26 .\nAs a consequence, we see that the d28 has jump deformations to d1 , d2 , d3 , d4 ,\nd5 , d6 , d7 , d8 , d9 , d18 , d19 , d20 , d21 , d22 , d23 , d24 , d25 and d26 .\nReferences\n1.
