Interesting multi-scale phenomena observed by the\nCluster spacecraft include large scale motion of the current sheet and bursty\nbulk flow associated turbulence, interpreted as a cross-scale coupling (CSC)\nprocess.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of turbulence in near-Earth cosmic plasma is important in many respects. Turbulence, being in its nature a multi-scale phenomenon, may influence\nthe transfer processes of energy, mass and momentum on both MHD and kinetic\nscales. Vice versa, turbulence can be driven by instabilities such as magnetic\nreconnection or current disruption [Tetreault(1992), Angelopoulos et al.(1999a),\nKlimas et al.(2000), Chang et al.(2002), Lui(2002)]\nThe understanding of intermittence features of fluctuations is fundamental to\nturbulence. Intermittence simply refers to processes which display 'sporadic activ1\n\n\fity' during only a small fraction of the considered time or space. This is also the\ncase in non-homogeneous turbulence where the distribution of energy dissipation\nregions is sporadic and probability distributions of measurable quantities are longtailed with significant departures from gaussianity. Rare events forming the tails\nof probability distribution functions, however, carry a decisive amount of energy\npresent in a process [Frisch(1995)].\nSubstantial experimental evidence exists for the occurence of intermittent processes within the plasma sheet. [Baumjohann et al.(1990)] showed that within the\ninner plasma sheet inside of 20 RE high-speed short-lived (\u223c 10 sec) plasma\nflows are rather bursty. [Angelopoulos et al.(1992)] noted that those flows organize themselves into \u223c 10 min time scale groups called bursty bulk flows (BBF).\nDespite the fact that BBFs represent relatively rare events (10-20 % of all measurements), they are the carriers of the decisive amount of mass, momentum and\nmagnetic flux [Angelopoulos et al.(1999b), Sch\u00f6del et al.(2001)] and can therefore\nenergetically influence the near-Earth auroral regions [Nakamura et al.(2001)].\nSo far experimental evidence for real plasma sheet turbulence is not unambiguous, however its existence is supported by the occurrence of plasma fluctuations in bulk flow velocity and magnetic field which are comparable or even larger\nthan the corresponding mean values [Borovsky et al.(1997)]. Other characteristics of plasma sheet turbulence, such as probability distributions, mixing length,\neddy viscosity, power spectra, magnetic Reynolds number, etc., were found to exhibit the expected features or to be in expected ranges predicted by turbulence\ntheories [Borovsky et al.(1997)]. Though the amplitude of the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations increases with geomagnetic activity [Neagu et al.(2002)],\nintense fluctuations are present independently from the level of geomagnetic activity [Borovsky et al.(1997)], indicating that different sources or driving mechanisms might be involved in their generation. In fact, according to observations by\n[Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)], at least a bi-modal state of the inner plasma sheet\nconvection is recognizable from plasma flow magnitude probability density functions: BBF\u2013associated intermittent jet turbulence and intermittent turbulence which\noccurs during non-BBF (quiet background) flows. [Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)]\nhave also proposed that BBF\u2013generated intermittent turbulence can alter transport\nprocesses in plasma sheet and may represent a way that cross-scale coupling (CSC)\ntakes place.\nThese facts call for a method which allows analysis of both intermittence and\nmulti-scale properties of fluctuations. In this paper we propose a multifractal technique for this purpose. Using both magnetic field and ion velocity data from Cluster, we will show that BBF\u2013associated 'magnetic turbulence' exhibits clear signatures of cross-scale energisation.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMultifractal approach to turbulence\n\nIn order to elucidate the basic assumptions of our approach we use a multinomial distribution model first and introduce a local parameter for quantification of\nthe intermittence level on a given scale. Then we discuss the range of potential\nscales over which the presence of cross-scale energisation might be experimentally\ndemonstrable and mention some limitations regarding the availability of multipoint\nobservations.\n\n2.1 Local intermittence measure (LIM)\nThe large scale representation of magnetotail processes by mean values of measurable quantities is useful but can also be misleading in characterising multi-scale\nphenomena when quantities observed on different scales carry physically important\ninformation.\nMultifractals are well suited for describing local scaling properties of dissipation fields in non-homogeneous turbulence [Frisch(1995)]. Therefore they are\nmost suitable for a description of plasma sheet fluctuations. In non-homogeneous\nturbulence, the transfer of energy from large scales to smaller scales can be conveniently modeled by a multiplicative cascade process. The distribution of energy\ndissipation fields on small scales exhibits burstiness and intermittence.\nLet us consider a simple model example. Multinomial deterministic measures\nare examples of multifractals [Riedi(1999)]. These consist of a simple recursive\nconstruction rule: a uniform measure \u03bc(L) is chosen on an interval I : [0, L] and\nis then unevenly distributed over n > 1 (n - integer) equal subintervals of I using\nP\nweights mi ; i = 1, ..., n and i mi = 1. Usually L is chosen to be 1. After the\nfirst iteration we have n equal subintervals, and subinterval i contains a fraction\n\u03bc(L)mi of \u03bc(L). Next every subinterval and the measure on it are splitted in the\nsame way recursively, having i = 1, ..., nk subintervals or boxes after k iteration\nsteps and \u03bck,i in the box Ik,i . Figure 1 shows the simplest example of a binomial\ndistribution (n = 2). We note that the measure \u03bc can be any positive and additive\nquantity, such as energy, mass, etc.\nFigure 2a presents two distributions, A and B, separated by a dashed vertical line in the middle. Both mimic typical bursty 'time series' like a physical variable from a turbulent system, however, by construction distribution A is\nless intermittent than distribution B . In both cases the same initial mass (\u03bc)\nis distributed over interval L, n = 8; k = 5 is chosen (that is nk = 32768\nboxes), but the weights mi (A) = (0.125, 0.08, 0.09, 0.16, 0.05, 0.25, 0.12, 0.125)\nand mi (B) = (0.1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.002, 0.04, 0.218, 0.09, 0.2) are different. Intermittence is larger in case B (Figure 2a) because of the larger differences between\n3\n\n\fweights (if all weights were equal, the resulting distribution would become homogeneous). Our goal is to quantify this level of intermittence by multifractals. The\ndefinition of multifractality in terms of the large deviation principle simply states\nthat a dissipation field, characterized locally by a given 'strength of burstiness' \u03b1,\nhas a distribution f (\u03b1) over the considered field. It measures a deviaton of the observed \u03b1 from the expected value \u03b1. The corresponding (\u03b1, f (\u03b1)) large deviation\nspectrum is of concave shape [Riedi(1999)].\nThe strength of local burstiness, the so called coarse-grain H\u00f6lder exponent \u03b1,\nis computed as\nlog\u03bck,i\n(1)\n\u03b1i \u223c\nlog[I]k,i\nwhere [I]k,i is the size of the k, i-th box and equality holds asymptotically.\nIt is expected that due to its multiplicative construction rule \u03bck,i will decay fast\nas [I]k,i \u2192 0 and k \u2192 \u221e. We add that \u03b1i < 1 indicates bursts on all scales while\n\u03b1i > 1 characterizes regions where events occur sparsely [Riedi(1999)]. Equation\n(1) then expresses the power-law dependence of the measure on resolution. Usually 'histogram methods' are used for the estimation of the f (\u03b1) specturm (called\nalso rate function), so that the number of intervals Ik,i for which \u03b1k,i falls in a\nbox between \u03b1min and \u03b1max (the estimated minimum and maximum values of\n\u03b1) is computed and f (\u03b1) is found by regression. In this paper, however, f (\u03b1)\nspectra are estimated using the FRACLAB package which was developed at the\nInstitute National de Recherche en Informatique, Le Chesnay, France. Here the\nwell known statistical kernel method for density estimations is used which also\nyields satisfactory estimations for processes different from purely multiplicative\nones [V\u00e9hel and Vojak(1998), Canus et al.(1998)].\nA comparison of Figures 2a and 3 indicates that the wider the f (\u03b1) spectrum the more intermittent the measure. This feature was also proposed to study\nthe possible role of turbulence in solar wind - magnetosphere coupling processes\n[V\u00f6r\u00f6s et al.(2002)] and this feature will be used to describe magnetic field intermittence in the plasma sheet.\nIn order to gain appropriate information about the time evolution of intermittence from real data we estimate f (\u03b1) within sliding overlapping windows W with\na shift S \u226a W . In our model case the time axis is represented by increasing\nnumber of subintervals Ik,i . LIM is introduced as the total area under each f (\u03b1)\ncurve within a window W , divided by the mean area obtained from the measurements along the reference measure A. Actually LIM (A) fluctuates around 1 due\nto errors introduced by finite window length. For measures, exhibiting higher level\nof intermittence than the reference measure A, LIM > 1. Figure 2b shows that\nfor measures A and B the different levels of intermittence are properly recognized\n\n4\n\n\fby LIM . Estimations based on a larger window (Window I: W = 7000 boxes,\nS = 100 boxes) are more robust, but a smaller window (Window II:W = 2000\nboxes, S = 100 boxes) allows a better localization of the transition point between\nmeasures A and B (thick line in the middle of Figure 2a).\n\n2.2 Multi-scale LIM\nDeterministic multinomial measures are self-similar in the sense that the construction rule is the same at every scale. Real data are more complex. Physical processes may have characteristic scales or may distribute energy differently over\nsome ranges of scales. In order to study BBF\u2013associated magnetic turbulence on\nboth large and small scales we introduce a 'time scale' \u03c4 through differentiation\n\u03b4Bx (t, \u03c4 ) = Bx (t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 Bx (t)\n\n(2)\n\nThroughout the paper the GSM coordinate system is used in which the x-axis is\ndefined along the line connecting the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth.\nThe origin is defined at the center of the Earth and is positive towards the Sun.\nThen a normalized measure at a time ti is given by\n\u03b4B 2 (ti , \u03c4 )\n\u03bcBx (ti , \u03c4 ) = P x 2\ni \u03b4Bx (ti , \u03c4 )\n\n(3)\n\nWe have to mention, however, some essential limitations of this approach when a\nseparation of spatial and temporal variations is eventually addressed. A time series\nobtained from a single spacecraft can be used for mapping the spatial structure\nof turbulence using the so called Taylor's hypothesis if the spatial fluctuations on\na scale l pass over the spacecraft faster than they typically fluctuate in time. In\nthe plasma sheet this can probably be the case during fast BBFs [Horbury(2000)].\nOtherwise Taylor's hypothesis may not be completely valid. Instead of Equation\n(2) a real two-point expression, \u03b4Bx+l (t) = Bx+l (t) \u2212 Bx (t) could be used, where\nl is a distance between Cluster spacecraft. The corresponding LIM , however,\nstrongly fluctuates in a variety of cases (not shown), presumably due to mapping\nof physically different and structured regions by individual Cluster satellites. We\npostpone this kind of multi-point observations to future work.\nNevertheless, [Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)] noticed that some characteristics of\nturbulence estimated from single point measurements are equivalent to ones from\ntwo-point measurements for distances at or beyond the upper limit of the inertial\nrange in which case Equation (2) can be used efficiently. [Borovsky et al.(1997)]\nestimated the lower limit of inertial range to be about ion gyroperiod time scales\n(\u223c 10 sec in plasma sheet), over which a strong dissipation of MHD structures is\n5\n\n\fexpected. The upper limit of inertial range (largest scale) was identified by plasma\nsheet convection time scale or by inter-substorm time scale, both of order 5 h. As\nknown, inertial range refers to a range of wavenumbers (or corresponding scales)\nover which turbulence dynamics is characterized by zero forcing and dissipation\n[Frisch(1995)]. Recent theoretical and experimental work shows, however, that\ninertial range cascades might be exceptional. In a large variety of turbulent flows\nrather bidirectional direct coupling (or cross scale coupling - CSC) due to nonlinearity and nonlocality between large and small scales exists [Tsinober(2001)].\nWhile the large scales are determined by velocity fluctuations, the small scales are\nrepresented by the field of velocity derivatives (vorticity, strain).\n\n3\n\nData analysis\n\n3.1 General considerations\nIn this paper we analyse intermittence properties of 22 Hz resolution magnetic field\ndata from the Cluster (CL) fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) [Balogh et al.(2001)]\nand compare those characteristics with the spin-resolution (\u223c 4 sec) velocity data\nfrom the Cluster ion spectrometry (CIS/CODIF) experiment [R\u00e8me et al.(2001)].\nCompared with the previous model example, the estimation of the LIM for\nthe BX component of the magnetic data was somewhat different. First of all, we\ncalculated LIM (t, \u03c4 ) for different time scales \u03c4 . In optimal case energization\nthrough a cascading process should appear on different scales time shifted, that\nis the large scales should become energized first and the small scales later. We\nfound, however, that on various scales LIM fluctuates strongly (not shown) and\nusing this approach it would be hard to identify an energy cascading process within\nan inertial range of scales. This was not unexpected, because cascade models are\ntreated in Fourier space (wave vector space) whereas our approach represents a\npure time-domain analysis method (though the magnetic field data itself already\ncontain some spatial information), so the individual scales have rather different\nmeanings. Also, nonlinear and nonlocal direct interactions between scales may\nprevent experimental recognition of cascades.\nTherefore, we decided to estimate LIM on several scales around 40 sec, which\nis considered to be a typical large scale of BBF velocity fluctuations, and compute\nthe average LIML (subscript L reads as large scale) from the corresponding f (\u03b1)\nspectra. BBF events usually last several minutes [Angelopoulos et al.(1992)], however, if \u03c4 is chosen to be several minutes long, the corresponding window length\nW should be even several times longer which would make measurements of the\nnon-stationary features of intermittence almost impossible.\nA typical small scale was chosen experimentally. We looked for a \u03c4 (Equation\n6\n\n\f2) which reflects the small scale changes of the intermittence level properly. We\nfound that fluctuations on time scales larger than a few seconds already exhibit\nsimilar intermittence properties as on scales around 40 sec. In fact, the majority\nof bursty flows may remain uninteruptedly at high speed levels for a few seconds\n[Baumjohann et al.(1990)]. Therefore we considered time scales around 0.4 sec\nas small ones (two orders less than the chosen large scale) and the corresponding\nintermittence measure reads as LIMS . This timescale may already comprise some\nkinetic effects. The use of 22 Hz resolution magnetic data from FGM experiment\non such small time scales implies the problem of different transfer functions for\nhigh and low frequencies. Corrections introduced by appropriate filtering had no\neffect on the LIM estimations.\n\n3.2 Event overview and LIM analysis\nThe events, we are interested in, occured between 1055 and 1135 UT on August\n29, 2001 (Figure 4a), when CL was located at a radial distance of about 19.2 RE ,\nnear midnight. In the following the relatively 'quiet' time period from 1115 to\n1120 UT will be used as a reference level for both LIML and LIMS estimations.\nIt means, that during this time period the LIML,S mean values equal 1.\nThe current sheet structure and movement during 1055 - 1107 UT has been\nstudied by [Runov et al.(2002)]. Only the BX component from CL 3 will be evaluated. During the chosen interval CL 3 was located approximately 1500 km south\nof the other three spacecraft. CL traversed the neutral sheet from the northern\n(BX \u223c 20 nT) to the southern hemisphere (BX \u223c \u221215 nT), then BX approached\nBX \u223c 0 again (Figure 4a). The correspondingly normalized small scale (\u03c4 =0.4\nsec) and large scale (\u03c4 =40 sec) measures (Equations 2 and 3) are depicted by red\nand blue curves in Figures 4 b an c, respectively. In fact, Equaton 2 represents a\nhigh-pass or low-pass filter for properly chosen time shifts \u03c4 . Therefore Figure 4b\n(4c) shows an enhanced level of small-scale (large-scale) fluctuations when highfrequency (low-frequency) fluctuations are present in Figure 4a. LIML,S were\ncomputed as a changing area under f (\u03b1) multifractal distribution curves over the\ninterval \u03b1 \u2208 (1, \u03b1max ) and within sliding window W=318 sec. The time shift\nis S=4.5 sec. These parameters were chosen such that the opposing requirements\nfor stability of LIM estimations (wide window needed) and for time-localization\nof non-stationary events (narrow window needed) were matched. Considering the\nwhole area under the f (\u03b1) curves, i.e. estimating LIM over \u03b1 \u2208 (\u03b1min , \u03b1max )\nas in the previous section (model case) would be also possible. This gives, however, the same qualitative results. During intervals of changing intermittence level\nmainly the right wing of f (\u03b1) changes. Therefore we estimated LIM over the\ninterval \u03b1 \u2208 (1, \u03b1max ). Figure 4d shows, 10 red curves of LIMS (t, \u03c4 ) computed\n7\n\n\ffor \u03c4 \u2208 (0.3, 0.5) sec, and 10 blue curves for \u03c4 \u2208 (30, 50) sec. Obviously, LIML\nand LIMS exhibit quite different courses and we will analyse the differences in\nmore detail.\nFirst, we examine the f (\u03b1) multifractal spectra. Windows A, B, C and D in\nFigure 4a indicate periods during which distinct physical phenomena occured. The\ndifferences are evident from the magnetic field BX , measures \u03bcBx and LIML,S\nevolution over time (Figure 4 a\u2013d). We focus mainly on an interval between 1123\nUT and 1133 UT in which both LIML and LIMS have increased values. Period C is during this interval. We contrast this interval with 1055 to 1110 UT, at\nthe beginning of which a wavy flapping motion or an expansion-contraction of the\ncurrent sheet is observed (Period A) with a characteristic time scale of 70-90 sec\n[Runov et al.(2002)]. Periods B and C represent quiet intervals with different BX\nvalues. The corresponding f (\u03b1) spectra are depicted by red and blue circles in\nFigure 5. We also computed the global f (\u03b1) spectra for the whole BX time series on small and large scales from 1055 to 1135 UT, which are depicted by solid\nred and blue lines, respectively. Deviations from these average f (\u03b1) curves classify physical processes occurring during periods A\u2013D. An examination of only the\nright wings of the distributions leads to the following conlusions (see also Figure\n4a and d): (1.) the f (\u03b1) spectra estimated on both large and small scales exceed the\naverage f (\u03b1) only during period C; (2.) during period A (large scale flapping motion) only the large scale (blue circles) exceed the average blue curve significantly;\n(3.) quiet periods B and D exhibit average or narrower than average distributions.\nWith the definition of LIM , we have introduced a number which quantifies\nintermittence as an area under the right wing of the f (\u03b1) distribution function.\nWe have to emphasize, however, that f (\u03b1) distributions cannot be described or replaced by one number. The whole distribution contains more information. It is evident from Figure 5 that the more intermittent period C is also characterized by the\nlargest difference between \u03b1max and \u03b1min on small scale (red circles). Also only in\nthis case the maximum of the f (\u03b1) curve is significantly shifted to the right. There\nare multiplicative cascade models for which multifractal distributions of concave\nshape and the underlying intermittence properties can be described by one parameter, e.g. the P-model [Halsey et al.(1986), V\u00f6r\u00f6s et al.(2002)]. However, those\nmodels cannot fit the data well because of the non-stationarity and shortness of the\navailable time series in the plasma sheet. This is clearly visible in the case of large\nscale non-concave distributions during periods A and C (blue circles, Figure 5).\nFor this reason LIM represents a descriptor which tells more about the intermittent fluctuations than second order statistics, but less than the whole multifractal\ndistribution function.\n\n8\n\n\f3.3 Multi-spacecraft comparison and BBF occurrence\nTo facilitate interpretation, the BX components from two Cluster spacecraft (CL1\nand CL3) are depicted in Figure 6a. The difference between the BX components\nmeasured at the locations of CL1 and 3 changes substantially during the considered interval, indicating spatial gradients of the order of the distance between CLs\nwithin current sheet. The largest spatial gradients occur during and after the flapping motion from 1055 to 1110 UT. Large gradients are also present during interval\n1122 \u2013 1130 UT. These two intervals are separated by a \u223c 10 min interval, from\n1110 to 1121 UT, characterized by small spatial gradients and \u221218 < BX < \u221210\nnT. Therefore, the spacecraft are outside of the current sheet. There are two more\nperiods when the observed spatial gradients are small. The first is before 1055 UT\n(BX > 18 nT), when the spacecraft were in the northern lobe. The interval after 1130 UT contains also small spatial gradients, but the BX components change\nfrom -6 to 2 nT, indicating that the spacecraft are closer to the center of current\nsheet.\nFigure 6b shows LIML,S (red and blue curves). Standard deviations computed\nfrom a number of f (\u03b1) distributions (Figure 4d) estimated around \u03c4 = 40 and\n0.4 sec are also depicted by thin lines round LIML,S (t) in Figure 6b. Window\nparameters are also indicated.\nIt is visible that during the large scale motion (thoroughly analysed by\n[Runov et al.(2002)]) and after, until \u223c 1110 UT (Figure 6a), LIM shows enhanced intermittence level on large scales, but not on small scales (Figure 6b).\nLIML is also high before 1055 UT, only because the local window W extends\nover the period of wavy motion of current sheet. As no enhanced intermittence\nlevel is observed during the whole interval until \u223c 1110 UT on small scales, we\nconclude that cross-scale energisation is not present. More precisely, at least in\nterms of intermittent fluctuations quantified by LIM , there was no CSC mechanism present that could couple large scale energy reservoirs at the level of the MHD\nflow (\u223c 40 sec) to the small scales (\u223c 0.4 sec). We cannot exclude, however, other\nmechanisms of CSC not directly associated with LIM changes.\nLIML tends to decrease rapidly after 1110 UT because data from outside the\ncurrent sheet influence its estimation.\nBetween 1120 and 1135 UT both LIML and LIMS increase. This enhancement is clearly associated with high frequency intermittent fluctuations in BX (Figure 6a; see also the global spectrum for period C in Figure 5) and with occurence of\na BBF. In Figure 6c we show the proton velocity data from CIS/CODIF experiment\n(H + VX ; GSM). Figure 7a shows magnetic field BZ component of the magnetic\nfield measured by CL3 while Figure 7b \u2013 d show BX , proton velocity and LIM at\nbetter time resolution than in Figure 6.\n9\n\n\fFour windows centered on points marked by crosses indicate the times when\nLIML,S significantly increase or decrease relative to the quiet level (LIML,S \u223c1).\nVertical red and blue arrows indicate the starting points of increase and decrease of\nLIML,S , respectively.\nWhen the spacecraft enter the current sheet after 1120 UT, LIML increases and\nwindow 1 shows that the enhancement is associated with the appearance of large\nscale fluctuations in BX , a small decrease of BZ and gradual increase of VX,H +\nstarting at 1122:20 UT (see the vertical dashed line at the right end of window 1).\nApproximately two minutes later, the center of window 2 points at first significant\nenhancement of LIMS (red vertical arrow). LIMS achieved its maximum value\n1.14 \u00b1 0.02 within \u223c 40 sec. The right end of window 2 is clearly associated with:\n(1.) magnetic field dipolarization (rapid increase of BZ to \u223c 8-10 nT in Figure 7a.);\n(2.) appearance of high frequency fluctuations in BX (CL3), (in Figure 7b.); (3.)\nBBF velocities larger than 400 km/s (Figure 7c.); (4.) enhancements of energetic\nion and electron fluxes on CL3 (not shown); all at \u223c 1124:27 UT.\nLIMS drops to 1.05 \u00b1 0.02 at 1127:45 UT (marked by red arrow from the center of window 3). This time, the right end of window 3 starts to leave behind the\nlargest peaks of VX,H + , but that is not the only reason of the decrease of LIMS .\nWhen LIMS decreases, LIML remains at high level (1.24 \u00b1 0.05), or even increases, because of the sudden jump in BX form -10 to +2 nT closely before 1130\nUT. It was previously mentioned that after 1130 UT the spacecraft got closer to the\ncenter of current sheet. Therefore, we suppose that due to the large scale motion\nof the current sheet, which keeps LIML at a high level, the spacecraft appear to\nbe outside of the region of BBF\u2013associated turbulence. This is also supported by\nthe simultaneous decrease of both LIML and LIMS at approximately 1132:30\nUT, when window 4 includes BX from the region with small gradients after 1130\nUT. Therefore, during the interval between the right ends of window 2 and 3, i.e.\nwithin a time period of \u223c 6 minutes from 1124 to 1130 UT, LIM analysis indicates BBF and dipolarization associated CSC between MHD and small, possibly\nkinetic scales. An alternative to the CSC might be a simultaneous, but independent enhancement of intermittent fluctuations on both large and small scales. As\nwas mentioned earlier, an identification of the energy-cascading process is almost\nimpossible using the applied method. The primary pile-up of energy associated\nwith increase of BBF velocity on large scales at 1122:20 UT, however, seems to\nindicate that in this case small scale fluctuations are energised by MHD scale rapid\nflows. Unambiguous evidence for or against BBF\u2013related CSC requires a statistical\nensemble of events to be analysed. We mention, inverse cascades during current\ndisruption events were reported by [Lui(1998)].\nThe large difference between LIML and LIMS after 1128 UT can be attributed to the prevailing large scale motion of the current sheet. The spacecraft\n10\n\n\fgot closer to the centre of current sheet where the multiscale LIM signs of CSC\nare already absent. This can be explained by the transitory and localized nature of\nCSC.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe proposed a windowed multifractal method to quantify local intermittence of\nmagnetic field fluctuations obtained by Cluster. The main results of this paper\ncomprise a multi-scale description of large scale current sheet motion and of a\nBBF\u2013associated cross-scale energisation process. We have shown as Cluster passes\nthrough different plasma regions, physical processes exhibit non-stationary intermittence properties on MHD and small, possibly kinetic scales. As any robust estimation of turbulence characteristics requires processing of long time series (due\nto the presence of energetic but rare events), the observed transitory and nonstationary nature of fluctuations prevents us to unambiguously support or reject\na model for plasma sheet turbulence.\nThe multifractal description of intermittent magnetic fluctuations is in accordance with previous knowledge that the change of fractal scaling properties can\nbe associated with phase transition like phenomenon and self organization in the\nplasma sheet [Chang(1999), Consolini and Chang(2001), Consolini and Lui(2001),\nMilovanov et al.(2001)]. Our results also support the idea of\n[Angelopoulos et al.(1999a)] that BBF\u2013related intermittent turbulence may represent an effective way for CSC. Propagating BBFs can modify a critical threshold for nonlinear instabilities or trigger further localized reconnections because\nof the free energy present on multiple scales. In this sense, our results suggest\nthat BBFs may represent those multiscale carriers of energy, flux and momentum,\nwhich lead to the avalanche-like spread of disturbances on medium or large-scales\n[Klimas et al.(2000), Lui(2002)]. In this respect classification of multi-scale physical processes using LIM , or multifractal distributions offers a way in which the\nrole of turbulence in a variety of dynamical processes within plasma sheet can be\nstatistically evaluated.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge the use of FRACLAB package developed at the Institut\nNational de Recherche en Informatique, France.
