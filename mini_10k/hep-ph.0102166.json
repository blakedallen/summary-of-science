It is emphasized that the so-called (2+2)-scheme as well as the (3+1)scheme are still consistent with the recent solar and atmospheric neutrino data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere have been several experiments 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 10,11,12,13 which suggest neutrino oscillations. To explain the solar, atmospheric and LSND data within\nthe framework of neutrino oscillations, it is necessary to have at least four\nkinds of neutrinos. It has been shown in the two flavor framework that the\nsolar neutrino deficit can be explained by neutrino oscillation with the sets\nof parameters (\u2206m2\u2299 , sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 ) \u2243 (O(10\u22125 eV2 ), O(10\u22122 )) (SMA (small mixing angle) MSW solution), (O(10\u22125 eV2 ), O(1)) (LMA (large mixing angle)\nMSW solution), (O(10\u22127 eV2 ), O(1)) (LOW solution) or (O(10\u221210 eV2 ), O(1))\n(VO (vacuum oscillation) solution). At the Neutrino 2000 Conference the Superkamiokande group has updated their data of the solar neutrinos and they\nreported that the LMA MSW solution gives the best fit to the data 9 . At the\nsame time they also showed that the scenario of pure sterile neutrino oscillations \u03bde \u2194 \u03bds is excluded at 95%CL. It has been known that the atmospheric\nneutrino anomaly can be accounted for by dominant \u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations with\nalmost maximal mixing (\u2206m2atm , sin2 2\u03b8atm ) \u2243 (10\u22122.5 eV2 , 1.0). Again the\nSuperkamiokande group has announced 10 that the possibility of pure sterile\nneutrino oscillations \u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bds is excluded at 99%CL. On the other hand, combining the final result of LSND and the negative results by E776 14 (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ),\nKarmen2 15 (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) and Bugey 16 (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ), the oscillation parameter sat< \u2206m2 \u223c\n< 8 eV2 and 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u223c\n< sin2 2\u03b8 \u223c\n< 0.04 at 99%CL. In this\nisfies 0.1 eV2 \u223c\ntalk I will review the present status of four neutrino scenarios in the light of\nthe recent Superkamiokande data of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos.\n2\n\nMass patterns\n\nIn the case of four neutrino schemes there are two distinct types of mass patterns. One is the so-called (2+2)-scheme (Fig. 1(a)) and the other is the\n1\n\n\fm24\n\nm24\n\nm21\n\nm23\n\nm22\nm23\n\nm23\nm22\nm21\n\n(a)\n\nm23\nm21\n\n(b)\n\nm24\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1: Mass patterns of four neutrino schemes. (a) corresponds to (2+2)-scheme, where\neither (|\u2206m221 | = \u2206m2\u2299 , |\u2206m243 | = \u2206m2atm ) or (|\u2206m243 | = \u2206m2\u2299 , |\u2206m221 | = \u2206m2atm ).\n(b) and (c) are (3+1)-scheme, where |\u2206m241 | = \u2206m2LSND and either (|\u2206m221 | = \u2206m2\u2299 ,\n|\u2206m232 | = \u2206m2atm ) or (|\u2206m232 | = \u2206m2\u2299 , |\u2206m221 | = \u2206m2atm ) is satisfied.\n\n(3+1)-scheme (Fig. 1(b) or (c)). Depending on the type of the two schemes,\nphenomenology is different.\n2.1\n\n(3+1)-scheme\n\nIt has been shown in Refs. 18,19 using older data of LSND 12 that the (3+1)scheme is inconsistent with the Bugey reactor data16 and the CDHSW disappearance experiment17 of \u03bd\u03bc . Let me briefly give this argument in Refs. 18,19 .\nWithout loss of generality I assume that one distinct mass eigenstate is \u03bd4 (See\nFig. 1(b) or (c)) and the largest mass squared difference is \u2206m243 \u2261 \u2206m2LSND .\nIn the case of (3+1)-scheme the constraints from the Bugey and CDHSW\ndata are given by\n1 \u2212 P (\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) = 4|Ue4 |2 (1 \u2212 |Ue4 |2 )\u220643 \u2264 sin2 2\u03b8Bugey (\u2206m243 )\u220643 ,\n1 \u2212 P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) = 4|U\u03bc4 |2 (1 \u2212 |U\u03bc4 |2 )\u220643 \u2264 sin2 2\u03b8CDHSW (\u2206m243 )\u220643 ,\n\u0001\nrespectively, where \u220643 \u2261 sin2 \u2206m243 L/4E , sin2 2\u03b8Bugey and sin2 2\u03b8CDHSW\nstand for the values of the boundary of the excluded region in the two flavor\nanalysis as functions of \u2206m2 (See Fig. 2). To explain the solar neutrino\ndeficit and the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric neutrino data it is\n2\n\n\fLSND 90%CL\nLSND 99%CL\nE776\nBugey+CDHSW\nKarmen2\nBugey\nCDHSW\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u2206m / eV\n\n2\n\n100\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\nallowed\nregion\nof (3+1)\nscheme\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8\nFigure 2: The allowed region of LSND from the final result (the inside of the thick and thin\nsolid lines corresponds to the allowed region at 99%CL and 90%CL, respectively) and the\nexcluded regions of E776, Karmen2, Bugey, CDHSW (the right hand side of each line). The\nright hand side of the line (Bugey+CDHSW) stands for the excluded region in the case of\nthe (3+1)-scheme. Only the four isolated shadowed areas at \u2206m2LSND \u22430.3, 0.9, 1.7, 6.0\neV2 are consistent with the LSND allowed region at 99%CL in the (3+1)-scheme.\n\n3\n\n\fnecessary to have |Ue4 |2 < 1/2 and |U\u03bc4 |2 < 1/2 and therefore I get\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\n1\n|Ue4 |2 \u2264\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b8Bugey (\u2206m243 )\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nq\n1\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 sin2 2\u03b8CDHSW (\u2206m243 ) .\n|U\u03bc4 |2 \u2264\n2\n\n(1)\n\nOn the other hand, the appearance probability P (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) of LSND in our\nscenario is given by\nP (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e ) = 4|Ue4 |2 |U\u03bc4 |2 \u220643 \u2261 sin2 2\u03b8LSND (\u2206m243 )\u220643 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere sin2 2\u03b8LSND (\u2206m243 ) stands for the value of sin2 2\u03b8 in the LSND allowed\nregion in the two flavor framework.

The region of \u03b823 > 0 has not been analyzed\nby Ref. 24 . Let me also stress that both the solar neutrinos and the atmospheric\nneutrinos are accounted for by hybrid of active and sterile oscillations in the\n(2+2)-scheme.\n4\n\n(3+1)-scheme\n\nAfter the work of Barger et al. 20 , people 25,26 have investigated various consequences of the (3+1)-scheme.

For simplicity I assume \u03b41 =0 since\nthe existence of the CP phase \u03b41 does not change the situation very much.\n\n4.1.1\n\n\u2206m2LSND =0.3 eV2\n\nSince we know from the Superkamiokande\natmospheric neutrino data that the\n\u0001\ncoefficient of sin2 \u2206m2atm L/4E in P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) has to be large to have a good\nfit, I optimize 4|U\u03bc3 |2 (1 \u2212 |U\u03bc3 |2 \u2212 |U\u03bc4 |2 ) with respect to \u03b823 for |U\u03bc4 |2 = 0.34.\nWhen Ue4 = 0 I have |U\u03bc3 |2 = c223 c224 , |U\u03bc4 |2 = s224 , |U\u03c4 4 |2 = c224 c234 , |Us4 |2 =\nc224 s234 in the notation of Ref. 18 , and it is easy to see\n4|U\u03bc3 |2 (1 \u2212 |U\u03bc3 |2 \u2212 |U\u03bc4 |2 ) = c424 sin2 2\u03b823 \u2264 c424 = 0.44,\nwhere equality holds when \u03b823 = \u03c0/4. This is the value of \u03b823 for which the\nfit of the (3+1)-scheme to the atmospheric neutrino data is supposed to be\nthe best for \u2206m2LSND =0.3 eV2 .

In this case cs \u2261 |Us1 |2 + |Us2 |2 \u2243 1 and the solar\nneutrino deficit would be accounted for by sterile neutrino oscillations \u03bde \u2194 \u03bds\nwith the SMA MSW solution while the atmospheric neutrino anomaly would\nbe by \u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations. This scenario is obviously inconsistent with the\nrecent solar neutrino data by the Superkamiokande group, and the argument\nwhich has lead to (9) has to be given up.\nFortunately the upper bound on N\u03bd has become less stringent now and\nN\u03bd = 4.0 seems to be allowed. Furthermore, it has been shown recently 33 that\nthe combined analysis of BBN and the recent data by BOOMERanG 34 and\nMAXIMA-1 35 of the Cosmic Microwave Background prefers higher value of\nN\u03bd : 4 \u2264 N\u03bd \u2264 13. Therefore all the four neutrino schemes of type (2+2) and\n(3+1) seemed to be consistent with the BBN constraint.\nOn the other hand, it has been pointed out 36 in the two flavor framework\nthat for a certain range of the oscillation parameters neutrino oscillations themselves create asymmetry between \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304 and this asymmetry prevents \u03bds from\noscillating into active neutrinos. Although this analysis has not been generalized to the four neutrino cases, even if the upper bound of N\u03bd becomes less than\n4.0 in the future, it might be still possible to have four neutrino schemes which\nare consistent with the BBN constraint as well as the solar and atmospheric\nneutrino data due to possible asymmetry in \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this talk I have shown that there are still four neutrino scenarios ((2+2)as well as (3+1)- schemes) which are consistent with all the experiments and\nthe observations, despite the recent claims by the Superkamiokande group that\npure sterile oscillations \u03bde \u2194 \u03bds in the solar neutrinos and pure sterile oscillations \u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bds in the atmospheric neutrinos are disfavored. In particular, the\nreason that the (2+2)-scheme is consistent with the recent Superkamiokande\ndata is because both solar and atmospheric neutrinos have hybrid oscillations\nof active and sterile oscillations.\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Yoshitaka Kuno for invitation and the local organizers\nfor hospitality during the workshop.
