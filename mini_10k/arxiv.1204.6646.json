Thus, even inside the vacuum, the atom's motion can never be\na free motion. Already pointed out was that, in the presence of such photon-atom entanglement, the atom's position-momentum uncertainty can be temporarily lower than the lower\nbound specified by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation [3]. It is certainly desirable to know\nwhat other effects the atom-vacuum interaction can have on the atom's motion.\nNote, the frequency of the emitted photon depends on the direction in which the photon\nis emitted according to the Doppler effect. In particular, when the photon is in the same\ndirection as the atom's velocity, it must have a frequency larger than the frequency it has\nwhen emitted in the opposite direction. On the other hand, the photon emitted in any\ntwo directions perpendicular to the velocity must have the same frequency. Since a higher\nfrequency means that a larger momentum is carried away by the photon, and that a larger\nmomentum is transferred to the atom from the photon, the excited atom, when moving,\nmust receive, on average, a nonzero momentum transferred from the photon, and should\nexperience, in addition to the photon-atom entanglement, a radiative force, on average,\nopposite to its velocity. The present paper is devoted to the derivation of the radiative force\nF~r . Since the radiative force is opposite to the atom's velocity, it is addressed as radiative\nfriction in the paper. In the literature, radiative forces on an atom are often discussed when\nthe atom is exposed to laser beams [1, 4], and are seldom analyzed when the atom is simply\nin the vacuum. Unlike the laser beams, the vacuum has far more electromagnetic modes\nto be considered. It will become evident in the following discussion that F~r also depends\ncritically on the photon-atom entanglement.\nDenote the momentum operator, position operator, and mass of the excited atom as\n~ and m respectively. For simplicity, the atom is assumed to have two energy states:\nP~ , R,\nan excited state |Ei with energy h\u0304\u03c9E and the ground state |Gi with energy h\u0304\u03c9G . The\ndifference between \u03c9E and \u03c9G is known as the atomic transition frequency \u03c90 \u2261 \u03c9E \u2212 \u03c9G .\nThe interaction between the vacuum modes and atom is assumed, as usual, to be through\nthe atom's electric dipole moment ~\u03bc and is described by an operator VI defined as\nVI =\n\nX\u0010\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n\u0011\n\n~\u03bcGE * ~g\u03b1 e\u2212ik\u03b1 *R a\u2020\u03b1 |GihE| + ~\u03bcEG * ~g\u03b1\u2217 eik\u03b1 *R a\u03b1 |EihG| ,\n\n\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~\u03bcGE is the matrix element of \u03bc\n~ between |Gi and |Ei, and ~\u03bcEG the complex conjugate\n2\n\n\fof \u03bc\n~ GE . The frequency and amplitude (containing a polarization unit vector ~\u01eb\u03b1 ) of mode \u03b1\nq\n\nare represented by \u03c9\u03b1 and ~g\u03b1 = i 2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c902 /(L3 \u03c9\u03b1 )~\u01eb\u03b1 respectively. The quantization volume\nis L3 . Also used in VI are ~k\u03b1 , the wave vector of mode \u03b1 (| ~k\u03b1 |= \u03c9\u03b1 /c), and a\u2020\u03b1 (a\u03b1 ),\nthe creation (annihilation) operator for the same mode. Throughout the paper, c is the\nspeed of light in the vacuum, and \u2217 denotes the complex conjugate of a quantity. Still for\nsimplicity, VI is treated under the rotating-wave approximation [5]. The Hamiltonian H\nof the atom-vacuum system is constructed by adding to VI the unperturbed Hamiltonian\nH0 = P 2 /(2m) + h\u0304\u03c9E |EihE| + h\u0304\u03c9G |GihG| +\n\n\u2020\n\u03b1 h\u0304\u03c9\u03b1 a\u03b1 a\u03b1 :\n\nP\n\nH = H0 + VI .\n\n(2)\n\nSince it is constant and unimportant to the atom-vacuum system's evolution, the zero point\nenergy of the vacuum is ignored in H. Also ignored is the R\u00f6ntgen interaction, because\nthis interaction [6, 7] is roughly of the order of vc\u22121 VI (where v is the atom's speed), much\nweak compared with VI in the present nonrelativistic analysis. For example, in a typical\nexperiment on spontaneous emission [8], v is merely of the order of 103 m/s.\nThe atom's initial external state |\u03c8(0)i =\n\nR\n\nd~p0 f (~p0 )|~p0 i is expressed in terms of the\n\neigenstates |~p0 i of the momentum operator. To mimic the initial condition, assumed without\nloss of generality, that the atom moves along the positive direction x\u0302 of the x-axis of a\ncoordinate system stationary in the vacuum, the eigenvalues p~0 of these states are assumed\nto be all along x\u0302. Since the atom is in the excited state |Ei, and no photons are present\n|0i, evolution of the atom-vacuum system must start from such an initial state |\u03c6(0)i =\n|\u03c8(0)i \u2297 |Ei \u2297 |0i. At time t, the state of the system |\u03c6(t)i consequently becomes\n|\u03c6(t)i = e\u2212\n\niHt\nh\u0304\n\n|\u03c6(0)i = \u2212\n\n1 Z \u221e e\u2212iqt/h\u0304\ndq\n|\u03c6(0)i.\n2\u03c0i \u2212\u221e q \u2212 H\n\n(3)\n\nAs, for example, in the discussion of the Ehrenfest theorem [9] and the atomic motion in the\nlaser beams [1, 4], the radiative friction F~r is defined to be proportional to the second-order\n~ taken with respect to\ntime derivative of the expectation value of the position operator R\nstate |\u03c6(t)i:\n2\n\nd\n~\n(4)\nF~r = m 2 h\u03c6(t)|R|\u03c6(t)i.\ndt\nConsider the x-component of the force F~r .

In Eq. (6), Px is the x-component of the momentum operator P~ .

The net result\nof these processes is that, as noted before, the atomic and photonic states are entangled [3]:\nf (~p0 )\n1\ndqe\u2212iqt/h\u0304 d~p0\n|~p0 i \u2297 |Ei \u2297 |0i\n|\u03c6(t)i = \u2212\n2\n2\u03c0i\nq \u2212 p0 /(2m) \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9E \u2212 B\nZ\n1 Z\nf (~p0 )\n\u2212iqt/h\u0304\n\u2212\nd~p0\ndqe\n2\n2\u03c0i\nq \u2212 p0 /(2m) \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9E \u2212 B\nZ\n\nZ\n\n~\n\n\u00d7\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n~\n\n(~\u03bcGE * ~g\u03b1 )e\u2212ik\u03b1 *R |~p0 i \u2297 |Gi \u2297 |1\u03b1 i\n,\nq \u2212 (~p0 \u2212 h\u0304~k\u03b1 )2 /(2m) \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9G \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9\u03b1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere p0 = |~p0 |, and\n\u03930h\u0304 h\n\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c90 i\n\u03930 h\u0304\n\u03a9 + \u03c90 ln (\n) \u2212i\n2\u03c90 \u03c0\n\u03c90\n2\n\u2261 Br + iBi .\n\nB \u2243 \u2212\n\n(9)\n\nIn the expression of B, the quantity \u03930 = 4 | ~\u03bcGE |2 \u03c903 /(3h\u0304c3 ) is the spontaneous emission\nrate of a stationary atom in the vacuum, and \u03a9 a cut-off frequency needed to make the\nnonrelativistic Hamiltonian H applicable in the present discussion [10]. Note, in Eq. (8),\n(~p0 \u2212 h\u0304~k\u03b1 )2 /(2m) is the atom's kinetic energy after the atom recoils from the photon emitted\ninto mode |1\u03b1 i.\nSubstitute Eq. (8) into Eq.

(10), ~\u03bcGE is averaged over its orientation to conform to the fact\nthat the orientation is usually unknown. Since the dependence of the atom's spontaneous\nemission on the atom's speed is weak [11], the contribution from the Doppler effect is ignored\nin the frequency of the emitted photon (\u03c90 + Br /h\u0304). Also used in Eq. (10) is the modecontinuum approximation; see, for example, Ref. [12]. A comparison of Eqs. (7) and (8)\nshows that the derivative in Eq. (10) can never survive unless the photonic and atomic\nstates are entangled as in Eq. (8).\nSimilarly, it is found that the second-order time derivatives of hRy i(t) and hRz i(t) both\n~ respectively. Thus, the radiation\nvanish, where Ry and Rz are the y- and z-components of R\nfriction F~r on the atom must be\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c9 |~\u03bcGE |\n(\u03c90 + Br /h\u0304)2 e\u2212\u03930 t d~p0 |f (~p0 )|2 p~0\nF~r = \u2212 0\n3mc5\nZ\n(\u03c90 + Br /h\u0304)2 h\u0304\u03930 \u2212\u03930 t\n= \u2212\nd~p0 |f (~p0 )|2 ~p0 .\ne\n2\n4m\u03c90 c\nZ\n\n(11)\n\nThree properties of F~r are recognized. First, the magnitude of F~r decays with time\nexponentially. This observation is understandable, because the force is only present when the\natom and photon interact during spontaneous emission, and spontaneous emission is largely\nan exponential process. For a discussion of spontaneous emission beyond the rotating-wave\napproximation, see, for example, Ref. [12]. Second, the force is proportional to the average\n(initial) momentum of the atom, a character of the average Langevin force if the atom's\nmotion is viewed as a Brownian motion [13]. Physically, the average momentum determines\nthe difference between the photonic frequencies when the photon is emitted in or opposite\nto the direction of the atomic velocity, and, thus, should also determine the strength of the\nfriction force. A stationary atom, whose momentum is zero, certainly does not experience\nthe friction force F~r . Finally, since it is proportional to the initial momentum of the atom,\nthe force F~r must depend on the coordinate system in which it is observed. As Eq. (7)\nshows, such dependence comes from the fact that\n\nd2\nhRx i(t)\ndt2\n\nis related to the wave vector ~k\u03b1\n\nof the photon, which, when combined with i\u03c9\u03b1 /c, is a 4-vector, and is different in different\nsystems. The friction force is not an invariant under the Lorentz transformation.\nIn conclusion, it is demonstrated that the motion of an excited atom in the vacuum is\nsubject to a friction force. The force comes not only from the photon-atom entanglement\n\n5\n\n\fbut also from the momentum transferred from the emitted photon to the atom.\n\n[1] L. Mandel and E.
