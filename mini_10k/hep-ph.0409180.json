The program is based on the extended Regge-eikonal\napproach for \"soft\" processes. Standard Model and its extensions are used for \"hard\"\nfusion processes. An interface to PYTHIA, CMSJET and CMKIN is provided.\nKeywords\nExclusive Double Diffractive Events \u2013 Pomeron \u2013 Regge-Eikonal model \u2013 event generator\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nUsually High Energy Physics is considered as the synonym of \"physics of particles\".\nNew phenomena in this area are related to discoveries of new particles or to the typical\n\"particle-like\" effects, such as \"Bjorken scaling\" in DIS or high-pT jets and so on. In the\nspace-time language these kinematical regimes correspond to small distances.\nHowever there is an area in High Energy Physics, which is related to rather large\ndistances, even at high energies. These phenomena are similar to the scattering of hadrons\nto small angles. The wellknown feature of such processes is that the angle distribution\ngives the typical diffractive pattern with zero-angle maximum and one or, sometimes, two\ndips. Here wave properties of hadrons play the main role. From this distribution we can\nmake the conclusion about size and shape of the scatterer, or the \"interaction region\".\nExperiments at the LHC which aim to study low (TOTEM,)- and high (CMS,)-pT\nregimes, related to typical undulatory (diffractive) and corpuscular (point-like) behavior\nof the corresponding cross-sections, may offer a very exciting possibility to observe an\ninterplay of both regimes. In theory the \"hard part\" can be (hopefully) treated with\nperturbative methods while the \"soft\" part is definitely nonperturbative.\nLarge number of event generators are devoted to partonic processes of the Standard\nModel and its extensions, i.e. work at small distances. It is wellknown, that perturbation\ntheory has some problems in the description of processes at large distances. That is why\ndiffractive processes are usually considered as special cases which description is based on\ndifferent phenomenological approaches. The most popular approach is the Regge-eikonal\nmodel.\nIn the present paper a brife description of the generator EDDE (Exclusive Double\nDiffractive Events) is given.\n\n2\n\nPhysics of EDDE.\n\nFor calculation of cross-sections we use the method developed in Refs. [1],[2]. It is based\non the extension of the Regge-eikonal approach, and succesfully used for the description\nof the HERA [3],[4] and p + p(p\u0304) \u2192 p + p(p\u0304) [5] data.\nGenerator works in the kinematical region:\n0.01 GeV 2 \u2264 |t1,2 | \u2264 1 GeV 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nMX2\n\u2264 \u03be1,2 \u2264 \u03bemax = 0.1 ,\n(2)\ns\nThe amplitude of the process p + p \u2192 p + X + p can be obtained in the following way\n(see Fig. 1). The first step is to calculate the \"bare\" amplitude TX , which is depicted in\nFig. 1a.\nThe \"hard\" part of TX is the usual gluon-gluon fusion process calculated by perturbative methods in the Standard Model or its extensions. In the first version EDDE1.1 three\ndifferent processes are included:\n\u03bemin \u2243\n\n\u2022 Standard model Higgs boson (H) production [6].\n2\n\n\ft1\n\np1\n\nT1\n\ns\n\nT2\n\np1-qT\n\np1\n\np1+qT-\u22061\n\np1-\u22061\n\nq1=q+\u22061\nX=Higgs,\nglueball, ...\n\nq\n\np2\n\na)\n\np1-\u22061\n\nV\n\ns\n\nTX\n\nX\n\nV\n\ns\n\nq2=-q+\u22062\np2\n\np2-\u22062\n\np2+qT\n\np2-qT-\u22062\n\np2-\u22062\n\nt2\n\nb)\n\nFigure 1: a) The process p+p \u2192 p+X +p.

Higgs boson (H\u2217 ) and Radion\n(R\u2217 ) production.\n\u2022 Standard model bb\u0304 production.\nFor all the processes total cross sections and distributions are calculated.\nThe more recent version EDDE1.2 is available. There are some additional processes:\n\u2022 Improved calculations for bb\u0304 production, including corrections to backround for\nHiggs or Radion production.\n\u2022 Standard model di-jet production.\n\u2022 Cross-sections for heavy quarkonia production at LHC.\n\u2022 Some azimuthal angular distributions.\n\"Soft\" amplitudes T1,2 are obtained in the extended Regge-eikonal approach. Parameters and formulaes can be found in Ref. [1]. The second step is the unitarization procedure,\nthat takes into account initial and final state interactions (see Fig. 1b).\n\n3\n\nProgram procedures and limits.\n\nThere are several procedures and functions in the generator.\nEDDE1.1:\n\u2022 function EDDECSHST(MH) returns the total cross-section of Standard model Higgs\nboson production in fb. MH is the Higgs boson mass in GeV. Typical values of the\ncross-section are 3.6 \u2192 0.1 fb in the mass region 100 \u2192 500 GeV.\n3\n\n\f\u2022 function EDDECSRS1(XI,GAM,HMASS,RMASS,NP) returns the total cross-section for\nH\u2217 (NP=1) or R\u2217 (NP=2)production. XI is the mixing parameter of the RS1 model [7].\nTypical values are \u22120.5 \u2192 0.5. GAM is the scale parameter of the model, which\nis equal to 246 GeV/\u039b. \u039b is the Radion vacuum expectation value, which is\ndirectly related to the radius of compact extra-dimension. Usually \u039b = 1 \u2192\n5 TeV. MASRS1(XI,GAM,HMASS,RMASS,NP) returns the mass of the observable state\nH\u2217 (NP=1) or R\u2217 (NP=2). Input parameters are the same.\n\u2022 EDDECSBBBG(Mcut) is the total cross-section for the leading order QCD bb\u0304 production in the EDDE at LHC. Mcut is the lower cut on the invariant mass of the bb\u0304\nsystem. Mcut= 2 MTcut, where q\nMTcut is the jet \"transverse mass\" cut, which is used\n2\nin other subroutines. MTcut = ET,cut\n+ m2b\n\u2022 procedure EDDETTPHI(GT1,GT2,GPHI0) generates the distribution\n1\nd\u03c3\n,\n\u03c3 dt1 dt2 d\u03c60\nwhere \u03c60 is the azimuthal angle between final protons.\n\u2022 \u03be-distribution (\u03be = 1\u2212xF ) is generated by the function EDDEX(HMASS), where HMASS\nis the invariant mass of the central system.\n\u2022 procedure EDDEMXUBB(MTcut,UG,MXG) generates the distribution for the \"hard\" process gg P P \u2192 bb\u0304. MTcut is the lower cut on the \"transverse mass\" of b(b\u0304) quark.\nEDDE1.2:\n\u2022 new procedure EDDECS0(NX,MTcut) is introduced instead of EDDECSBBBG which returns total cross-sections of bb\u0304 or gg di-jets and heavy quarkonia production at\nLHC.\nNX = 1 \u2192 b b\u0304\nNX = 2 \u2192 g g\nNX = 3 \u2192 \u03c7c,0\nNX = 4 \u2192 \u03c7b,0\nParameter MTcut is used for di-jet production only. In the STAGEN interface\nMTcut=Rpar(107). Default value is 25 GeV.\n\u2022 procedure EDDEMXUGG(MTcut,UG,MXG) generates the distribution for the \"hard\" process gg P P \u2192 gg. MTcut is the lower cut on the transverse momentum of gluon (see\nabove comment).\n\u2022 additional modification of the procedure EDDETTPHI(GT1,GT2,GPHI0) which is transformed to the more general one EDDETTPHI(NX,GT1,GT2,GPHI0), where NX is the\ncode number of produced particle or system of particles.\n\n4\n\n\fNX\n1 \u2192 Higgs, H*, R*, other heavy 0++ states\n2 \u2192 bb\u0304\n3 \u2192 gg\n4 \u2192 0\u2212+ state\nOther states will be added in the forthcoming version.\n\n4\n\nResults.\n\nHere some samples from the work of the generator with PYTHIA [8] are presented (see\nFigs. 3a)-d).)\nFor both versions the iterface to the last version of PYTHIA is provided.\nThe updated version of the generator EDDE1.2 will be available on the web-page:\nhttp : //sirius.ihep.su/cms/higgsdif f /dif f.html\nInterface to CMKIN will be provided soon.\nFor the first version EDDE1.1 with interface to CMKIN and CMSJET [9] (in the\nSTAGEN package) see the page\nhttp : //cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/generators/www/geners/collection/stagen/stagen.html\nSomeone can use the new source file for STAGEN (see the webpage) to update EDDE1.1\nuntil the new interface is provided.\n\nAknowledgements\nThis work is supported by grants CNRS-PICS-2910 and RFBR-04-02-17299.\nThanks to Andrey Sobol for the first version of the generator DPEHiggs, to Sergei\nSlabospitsky, who helped to correct the interface to PYTHIA and CMSJET, to Kreiton\nHogg and Marek Tasevsky for helpful discussions concerning the work of the generator\nEDDE1.1.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.A.
