The paper studies the class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences (i. e., becoming strongly almost periodic after deleting\nsome prefix). We prove that the property of eventual strong almost\nperiodicity is preserved under the mappings done by finite automata\nand finite transducers. The class of almost periodic sequences includes\nthe class of eventually strongly almost periodic sequences. We prove\nthis inclusion to be strict.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrongly almost periodic sequences (=uniformly recurrent infinite words)\nwere studied in the works of Morse and Hedlund [1, 2] and of many others\n(for example see [4]). This notion first appeared in the field of symbolic\ndynamics, but then turned out to be interesting in connection with computer\nscience.\nEvidently, the class of finite automata mappings of strongly almost periodic sequences (for definitions see below) contains the class of eventually\nstrongly almost periodic sequences, i. e., becoming strongly almost periodic\nafter deleting some prefix. Indeed, we use finite automaton with delay to get\nthe sequence a\u03c9 from the strongly almost periodic sequence \u03c9: this automaton keeps the string a in memory, first outputs this string and then outputs\nthe input sequence with delay |a| (always remembering last |a| symbols of\nthe sequence). The main result of the article (Theorem 2) states the equality\nof the classes. In other words, Theorem 2 says that finite automata preserve\n1\n\n\fthe property of eventual strong almost periodicity. In the last section we\nconsider the generalized version of finite automaton - finite transducer -\nand prove the same statement for it.\nThe notion of almost periodic sequence was studied in [5]. The authors\nprove that the class of almost periodic sequences is also closed under finite\nautomata mappings. It can easily be checked that the class of almost periodic sequences contains the class of eventually strongly almost periodic\nsequences. We prove this inclusion to be strict (Theorem 1).\nLet A be a finite alphabet with at least two symbols. Consider the sequences over this alphabet - mappings \u03c9 : N \u2192 A (where N = {0, 1, 2, . . . }).\nDenote by A\u2217 the set of all finite strings over A including the empty string \u039b.\nIf i \u2264 j are natural, denote by [i, j] the segment of natural numbers with\nends in i and j, i. e., the set {i, i + 1, i + 2, . . . , j}. Also denote by \u03c9[i, j] the\nsegment of the sequence \u03c9 - the string \u03c9(i)\u03c9(i+1) . . . \u03c9(j). A segment [i, j]\nis an occurrence of a string x \u2208 A\u2217 in a sequence \u03c9 if \u03c9[i, j] = x. Denote by\n|x| the length of the string x. We imagine the sequences going horizontally\nfrom the left to the right, so we use terms \"to the right\" or \"to the left\" to\ntalk about greater and smaller indices respectively.\n\n2\n\nAlmost periodicity\n\nA sequence \u03c9 is called almost periodic if for any string x occurring in the\nsequence infinitely many times there exists a number l such that any segment\nof \u03c9 of length l contains at least one occurrence of x. We denote the class\nof these sequences by AP.\nA sequence \u03c9 is called strongly almost periodic if for any string x occurring in the sequence at least once there exists a number l such that any\nsegment of \u03c9 of length l contains at least one occurrence of x (and therefore\nx occurs in \u03c9 infinitely many times). Denote by SAP the class of these\nsequences.\nFor convenience we introduce one additional definition: a sequence \u03c9 is\neventually strongly almost periodic if \u03c9 = a\u03bd for some \u03bd \u2208 SAP and a \u2208 A\u2217 .\nThe class of these sequences we denote by EAP.\nEvery eventually strongly almost periodic sequence is obviously almost\nperiodic. Let us show that EAP is a proper subclass of AP.\nTheorem 1. There exists a binary sequence \u03c9 such that \u03c9 \u2208 AP, but\n\u03c9\u2208\n/ EAP.\n\n2\n\n\fProof. Construct a sequence of binary strings a0 = 1, a1 = 10011,\na2 = 1001101100011001001110011, and so on, by this rule:\nan+1 = an \u0101n \u0101n an an ,\nwhere x\u0304 is a string obtained from x by changing every 0 to 1 and vice versa.\nPut\ncn = an an . . . an\n| {z }\n10\n\nand\n\u03c9 = c0 c1 c2 c3 . . .\nProve that \u03c9 is a required one.\nThe length of an is 5n , so the length of c0 c1 . . . cn\u22121 is 10(1 + 5 + * * * +\nn\u22121\n5\n) = 25 (5n \u2212 1). By definition, put\nln =\n\n5 n\n(5 \u2212 1) = |c0 c1 . . . cn\u22121 |.\n2\n\nShow that \u03c9 is almost periodic. Suppose x 6= \u039b occurs in \u03c9 infinitely\nmany times. Take n such that |x| < 5n . Suppose [i, j] is an occurrence of x\nin \u03c9 such that i \u2265 ln . By construction, for any k we can consider the part\nof \u03c9 starting from the position lk as a concatenation of strings ak and \u0101k .\nThus by definition of i the string x is a substring of one of four strings an an ,\nan \u0101n , \u0101n an , \u0101n \u0101n . Note that the string 10011 contains all strings of length\ntwo 00, 01, 10, 11, so the string an+1 contains each of an an , an \u0101n , \u0101n an ,\n\u0101n \u0101n . So, x is a substring of an+1 . Similarly, x is a substring of \u0101n+1 . If the\nsegment of length 2|an+1 | occurs in the sequence to the right of ln+1 , then\nan+1 or \u0101n+1 occurs in this segment. Hence for l = 25 (5n+1 \u2212 1) + 2 * 5n+1 it\nis true, that on every segment of length l there exists an occurrence of x.\nProve now that for any n > 0 the string cn does not occur in \u03c9 to the\nright of ln+1 . In this case, cn occurs finitely many times in the sequence\nobtained from \u03c9 by deleting some prefix of the length at most ln , i. e.,\nthis sequence is not strongly almost periodic. Therefore \u03c9 is not eventually\nstrongly almost periodic.\nLet \u03bd be the sequence obtained from \u03c9 by deleting the prefix of the length\nln+1 . As above, for each k, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n + 1, \u03bd is a concatenation of strings ak\nand \u0101k . Assume cn occurs in \u03bd and let [i, j] be one of this occurrences. For\nn > 0 the string cn begins with a1 , hence [i, i + 4] is an occurrence of a1 in \u03bd.\nWe see that a1 = 10011 occurs in a1 a1 = 1001110011, a1 \u01011 = 1001101100,\n\u01011 a1 = 0110010011 or \u01011 \u01011 = 0110001100 only in zeroth or fifth position.\n3\n\n\fThus 5|i, i. e., \u03bd and cn can be considered as constructed of \"letters\" a1 and\n\u01011 , and we assume that cn occurs in \u03bd. Now it is easy to prove by induction\non m that 5m |i for 1 6 m 6 n, i. e., we can consider \u03bd and cn as constructed\nof \"letters\" am and \u0101m , and assume that cn occurs in \u03bd (the base for m = 1\nis already proved, but we can repeat the same argument changing 1 and\n0 to am and \u0101m and taking into account that cn begins with am for each\n1 \u2264 m \u2264 n).\nTherefore we have shown that 5n |i, i. e., if we consider \u03bd and cn to\nbe constructed of \"letters\" an and \u0101n , then cn = an an . . . an occurs in \u03bd.\n| {z }\n10\n\nHowever there exists an occurrence of \"five-letter\" string an+1 or \u0101n+1 on\neach segment of 10 consequent \"letters\" an and \u0101n in \u03bd, and \u0101n occurs in\nthis string. This is a contradiction.\nMoreover, it is quite easy to modify the proof and to construct continuum\nof sequences in AP \\ EAP. For example, for each sequence \u03c4 : N \u2192 {9, 10}\nwe can construct \u03c9\u03c4 in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1, but\ninstead of cn we take\ncn(\u03c4 ) = an an . . . an .\n| {z }\n\u03c4 (n)\n\nObviously, all \u03c9\u03c4 are different for different \u03c4 and hence there exists continuum of various \u03c4 .\nIn conclusion, we can remark that, as it is shown in [5], there exists\ncontinuum of different sequences in SAP too.\n\n3\n\nFinite automata mappings\n\nFinite automaton is a tuple F = hA, B, Q, q\u0303, f i, where A and B are finite\nsets called input and output alphabets respectively, Q is a finite set of states,\nq\u0303 \u2208 Q is the initial state, and f : Q \u00d7 A \u2192 Q \u00d7 B is the translation function.\nWe say that the sequence hpn , \u03b2(n)i\u221e\nn=0 , where pn \u2208 Q, \u03b2(n) \u2208 B, is the\nautomaton mapping of the sequence \u03b1 over alphabet A, if p0 = q\u0303 and for\neach n we have hpn+1 , \u03b2(n)i = f (pn , \u03b1(n)). Thus we say that F outputs the\nsequence \u03b2 and denote this output by F (\u03b1). If [i, j] is an occurrence of the\nstring x in the sequence \u03b1, and pi = q, then we say that automaton F comes\nto this occurrence of x in the state q.\nIn [5] the following statement was proved: if F is a finite automaton,\nand \u03c9 \u2208 AP, then F (\u03c9) \u2208 AP.\nThis theorem can be expanded.\n4\n\n\fTheorem 2. If F is a finite automaton, and \u03c9 \u2208 EAP, then F (\u03c9) \u2208 EAP.\nProof. Obviously, it is enough to prove the theorem for \u03c9 \u2208 SAP, as every eventually strongly almost periodic sequence keeps this property after\naddition a prefix.\nThus let \u03c9 \u2208 SAP. By the previous statement, F (\u03c9) \u2208 AP. Suppose\nF (\u03c9) is not eventually strongly almost periodic. It means that for any\nnatural N there exists a string that occurs in F (\u03c9) after position N and\ndoes not occur to the right of it. Indeed, if we remove the prefix [0, N ] from\nF (\u03c9), we do not get strongly almost periodic sequence, hence there exists\na string occurring in this sequence only finitely many times. Then take the\nrightmost occurrence.\nLet [i0 , j0 ] be the rightmost occurrence of a string y0 in F (\u03c9). For some\nl0 the string x0 = \u03c9[i0 , j0 ] occurs in every segment of the length l0 in \u03c9 (by\nthe property of strong almost periodicity). If F comes to i0 in the state q0 ,\nthen F never comes to righter occurrences of x in the state q0 because in\nthis case automaton outputs y0 completely.\nNow let [r, s] be the rightmost occurrence of some string a in F (\u03c9), where\nr > i0 + l0 . On the segment \u03c9[r \u2212 l0 , r] there exists an occurrence [r \u2032 , s\u2032 ] of\nthe string x0 . By definition of r we have r \u2032 > i0 . Thus assume\ni1 = r \u2032 , j1 = s, x1 = \u03c9[i1 , j1 ], y1 = F (\u03c9)[i1 , j1 ].\nSince a does not occur in F (\u03c9) to the right of r, then y1 does not occur\nin F (\u03c9) to the right of i1 , for it contains a as a substring. Therefore if the\nautomaton comes to the position i1 in the state q1 , then it never comes to\nrighter occurrences of x1 in the state q1 . Since x1 begins with \u03c9[r \u2032 , s\u2032 ] =\nx0 , and r \u2032 > i0 , we get q1 6= q0 . We have found the string x1 such that\nautomaton F never comes to occurrences of x1 to the right of i1 in the state\nq0 or q1 .\nLet m = |Q|. Arguing as above, for k < m we construct the strings\nxk = \u03c9[ik , jk ] and corresponding different states qk , such that F never comes\nto occurrences of xk in \u03c9 to the right of ik in the states q0 , q1 , . . . , qk . For\nk = m we have a contradiction.\n\n4\n\nFinite transducers\n\nLet A and B be finite alphabets. The mapping h : A\u2217 \u2192 B \u2217 is called homomorphism, if for any u, v \u2208 A\u2217 we have h(uv) = h(u)h(v). Clearly, any\nhomomorphism is fully determined by its values on one-character strings.\n5\n\n\fLet \u03c9 be the sequence over the alphabet A. By definition, put\nh(\u03c9) = h(\u03c9(0))h(\u03c9(1))h(\u03c9(2)) . . .\nSuppose h : A\u2217 \u2192 B \u2217 is a homomorphism, \u03c9 is an almost periodic sequence over A. In [5] it was shown that if h(\u03c9) is infinite, then it is almost\nperiodic. Thus it is obvious, that if \u03c9 is strongly almost periodic, and h(\u03c9)\nis infinite, then h(\u03c9) is also strongly almost periodic. Indeed, it is enough\nto show that any v occurring in h(\u03c9) occurs infinitely many times. However\nthere is some string u occurring in \u03c9 such that h(u) contains v, but by the\ndefinition of strong almost periodicity u occurs in \u03c9 infinitely many times.\nEvidently, for \u03c9 \u2208 EAP we have h(\u03c9) \u2208 EAP, if h(\u03c9) is infinite.\nNow we modify the definition of finite automaton, allowing it to output\nany string (including the empty one) over output alphabet reading only one\ncharacter from input. This modification is called finite transducer (see [3]).\nFormally, we only change the definition of translation function. Now it has\nthe form\nf : Q \u00d7 A \u2192 Q \u00d7 B \u2217.\n\u2217\nIf the sequence hpn , vn i\u221e\nn=0 , where pn \u2208 Q, vn \u2208 B , is the mapping of \u03b1,\nthen the output is the sequence v0 v1 v2 . . .\nActually, we can decompose the mapping done by finite transducer into\ntwo: the first one is a finite automaton mapping and another is a homomorphism. Each of these mappings preserves the class AP, so we get the\ncorollary: finite transducers map almost periodic sequences to almost periodic. Similarly, by Theorem 2 and arguments above we also get the following statement: finite transducers map eventually strongly almost periodic\nsequences to eventually strongly almost periodic (if the output is infinite).\n\nAcknowledgements.
