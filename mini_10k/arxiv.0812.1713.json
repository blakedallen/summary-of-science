Introduction\nIn his pioneering work [1], Shannon introduced information theoretic security and defined perfect secrecy, which roughly refers to the case in which an\nenciphered cryptogram does not reveal any information to an eavesdropper about the underlying secret\nmessage. Shannon proved that perfect secrecy can be\nachieved with a shared secure key that is as long as\nthe underlying message. Wyner showed in [2] that perfect secrecy can be achieved even without key distribution if the cryptogram is transmitted over a noisy\nbroadcast channel in which the eavesdropper's channel\nis physically degraded with respect to the legitimate receiver's channel. This result was extended to more general broadcast channels in [3], where it was shown that\nnonzero secrecy capacity can be achieved if the main\nchannel is less noisy than the eavesdropper's channel.\nSecure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers\nhas gained a recent interest, and information theoretic\nsecurity in various models has been explored in detail\n(see, for example, [4], [5], [6] and [7]).\nWhile it is well-known that feedback doesn't increase the capacity of a point-to-point memoryless\nchannel, it was observed in [8] that the availability of\nThis research was supported by the US National Science\nFoundation under grants CCF-04-47743, ANI-03-38807, and\nCNS-06-25637.\n\nfeedback might increase the secrecy capacity of a pointto-point memoryless channel. This can be immediately\nseen by considering an infinite capacity secure feedback link from the legitimate receiver to the legitimate\ntransmitter. The feedback link can be used to transmit a secure key. This secure key can then be used to\ntransmit the message securely over the forward channel\nvia the one-time-pad coding scheme. Hence, an infinite\ncapacity secure feedback channel allows the system to\nachieve a secrecy capacity equal to the forward channel capacity as if the eavesdropper is not present. It\nis observed in [9], [10] that even public communication\nbetween the legitimate users can enhance the secrecy\ncapacity. It has been shown that positive secrecy capacity can be achieved through public communication\neven if the eavesdropper's forward channel is less noisy.\nIn [9] and [10] upper and lower bounds for the perfect secrecy capacity are provided in the case of public\ncommunication. These bounds match only for certain\nspecial cases. A feedback jamming scheme is also described in [11] for modulo additive channels.\nIn this paper, we first propose an achievable secrecy\nscheme for a general wiretap channel model with feedback (see Fig. 1), in which the forward channel from\nAlice to Bob and Eve and the backward channel from\nBob to Alice and Eve are orthogonal broadcast channels. The achievability of the proposed scheme follows\nfrom using the backward channel for generating a secret\nkey shared by Alice and Bob and then using this secret\nkey to transmit the message securely over the forward\nchannel via the one-time-pad coding scheme. We then\napply this secrecy scheme, in conjunction with Maurer's feedback coding technique [9], to a scenario with\nindependent binary symmetric forward and backward\nchannels. We explicitly describe the achievable secrecy\nrates of the proposed scheme and show the improvements in secrecy rate achieved with respect he feedback\nscheme for binary symmetric channels proposed in [12].\nIn the second part of this paper, we consider secret communication through a Gaussian wiretap channel with perfect channel output feedback, i.e., Bob's\n\n\feplacements\n\nforward channel\n\nXf\nW\n\nAlice\nYb\n\nZf\nEve\nZb\n\nYf\nBob\n\n\u0174\n\nXb\n\nbackward channel\n\ngi : Yfi\u22121 \u00d7 Xbi\u22121 \u2192 Xb which map previous channel outputs and the feedback inputs to the i-th feedback input, i = 1, . . . , n, and finally a decoder at Bob\nh : Yfn \u00d7 Xbn \u2192 W, which maps the channel outputs\nand the feedback inputs of Bob to the decoded message\n\u0174 .\nAs usual, the block error probability of a code is\ndefined as\nnR\n\nFigure 1: Wiretap channel with noisy feedback channel\nwhose output can also be observed by the eavesdropper.\nnoisy channel output is perfectly available to Alice in\na casual manner. This system is consistent with the\nmodel considered in the Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) [13]\nscheme, where perfect causal feedback was shown to\ngreatly simplify the achievability of the point-to-point\nlink from Alice to Bob and also improve the error exponent by exploiting the perfect feedback link in this scenario. The SK scheme is a simple deterministic scheme\nwhich is easy to implement and analyze as opposed to\nShannon theoretic random coding involving long codewords and high complexity encoding/decoding. We\nshow that, in addition to all these attractive properties, the SK scheme also achieves the secrecy capacity\nin the presence of an eavesdropper when the eavesdropper (Eve) receives a noisy observation of the feedback\nfrom Bob in addition to her own channel output from\nAlice as depicted in Fig. 4.\nIn the rest of the paper, we use X n and Xin to\ndenote the sequences (X1 , . . . , Xn ) and (Xi , . . . , Xn ),\nrespectively. We also define [x]+ = max{x, 0}.\n\nPen\n\n=\n\n1\n2nR\n\n2\nX\n\nPr{\u0174 6= W },\n\n(1)\n\nW =1\n\nwhile the equivocation rate is defined as\nRen =\n\n1\nH(W |Zfn , Zbn ).\nn\n\n(2)\n\nDefinition 2.2 A secrecy rate R is achievable if there\nexists a sequence of (2nR , n) codes for which Pen \u2192 0\nas n goes to infinity and the equivocation rate satisfies\nR \u2264 lim Ren .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nDefinition 2.3 The secrecy capacity Csf in the presence of feedback is the highest achievable rate R.\n3. An Achievable Secrecy Rate\nIn the following theorem, we give a lower bound to\nthe secrecy capacity in the presence of feedback. The\nachievability follows from using the backward channel\nfor generating a secret key shared by Alice and Bob,\nand then using this secret key in the forward channel\nto increase the secrecy capacity of the forward channel.\n\n2. System Model and Definitions\n\nTheorem 3.1 Rate Rs is achievable if,\n\nIn the system shown in Fig. 1, Alice wants to transmit a message W \u2208 W to Bob over the discrete memoryless broadcast channel p(yf , zf |xf ), where Xf \u2208 Xf\nis Alice's channel input and Yf \u2208 Yf and Zf \u2208 Zf\nare the outputs at Bob and Eve, respectively. There\nis also an independent feedback channel p(yb , zb |xb ),\nwhere Xb \u2208 Xb is Bob's feedback channel input and\nYb \u2208 Yb and Zb \u2208 Zb are the outputs at Alice and\nEve, respectively. Here, subscripts 'f ' and 'b' represent\nforward and backward channels, respectively.\n\n0 \u2264 Rs \u2264 min{I(Vf ; Yf ), I(Vf ; Yf |Uf ) \u2212 I(Vf ; Zf |Uf )\n\nDefinition 2.1 A (2nR , n) code for the above feedback channel is composed of a message W uniformly\ndistributed over set W = {1, . . . , 2nR }, stochastic encoders at Alice fi : W \u00d7 Ybi\u22121 \u2192 Xf which map the\nmessage and the previous feedback outputs to the i-th\nchannel input, and stochastic feedback encoders at Bob\n\n+I(Vb ; Yb ) \u2212 I(Vb ; Zb )},\nfor some auxiliary random variables Uf , Vf , and\nVb satisfying I(Uf ; Zf ) \u2265 I(Uf ; Yf ) with a joint\ndistribution p(vb , xb , yb , zb , uf , vf , xf , yf , zf ) = p(vb )\n*p(xb |vb )p(yb , zb |xb )p(uf )p(vf |uf )p(xf |vf )p(yf , zf |xf ),\ni.e., Uf\n\u2192 Vf\n\u2192 Xf\n\u2192 (Yf , Zf ) and\nVb \u2192 Xb \u2192 (Yb , Zb ).\nProof: The achievability scheme is based on a separation approach in the sense that, Bob uses the backward channel to generate a shared secret key of rate\nRk , and then this shared key is used to transmit the\nmessage W over the direct channel. We can utilize a\nblock based coding structure, where a secure key is generated in the i-th block, i = 1, . . . , B, and used in block\n\n\fi + 1, and the desired rate is achieved in the limit of\ninfinite blocks, i.e., as B \u2192 \u221e.\nFor simplicity, we give the proof for a constant Uf .\nAlso, for given PVf Xf Yf Zf , one\ncan consider an auxiliary channel PXf |Vf and\nthe\nP code for the induced channel PYf Zf |Vf =\nHence, we\nxf PXf |Vf (xf |vf )PYf Zf |Xf (yf , zf |xf ).\nprove the achievability of min{I(Xf ; Yf ), I(Xf ; Yf ) \u2212\nI(Xf ; Zf ) + I(Vb ; Yb ) \u2212 I(Vb ; Zb )}. The more general\nproof follows as in [3]. It is possible to generate a secret\nkey Wk at rate\nRk , min{[I(Vb ; Yb ) \u2212 I(Vb ; Zb )]+ , I(Xf ; Zf )}.\nover the backward channel [3]. From the perspective of\nthe forward channel, the problem is now equivalent to\nfinding the secrecy capacity of the broadcast channel\nwith a secret key of rate Rk .\nLet R1 , I(Xf ; Yf ) \u2212 I(Xf ; Zf ).\nGenerate 2nI(Xf ;Yf ) codewords independent identically\ndisQn\ntributed (i.i.d.) with probability p(xnf ) = i=1 p(xf i ),\nand partition these codewords into 2nR1 codebooks\nwhich we name as C1 , . . . , C2nR1 . Further divide each\nsubcodebook Ci into 2nRk smaller codebooks, which\nare named as Ci,1 , . . . , Ci,2nRk . For each message w =\n[w1 , w2 ], where w1 \u2208 [1, 2nR1 ] and w2 \u2208 [1, 2nRk ], first\ngenerate w2\u2032 = w2 \u2295 wk mod(2nRk ), and transmit a\ncodeword chosen uniformly random from the codebook\nCw1 ,w2\u2032 . Bob can correctly find (w1 , w2\u2032 ), hence w1 using\nthe secret key, with high probability for large enough n.\nOn the other hand, Eve can determine w2\u2032 and the codeword index within the smallest codebook, but cannot\nreceive any information about w1 . Moreover, no information about w2 is revealed to Eve as well, because w2\u2032\nis uniformly distributed and independent of w2 .\nCorollary 3.2 If Bob's channel in the forward direction and Alice's channel in the backward direction are\nboth less noisy then Eve's, the highest secrecy rate\nachievable by the proposed scheme in Theorem 3.1 can\nbe simplified as\nRs\n\n\u2264 min{I(Xf ; Yf ), I(Xf ; Yf ) \u2212 I(Xf ; Zf )\n+ I(Xb ; Yb ) \u2212 I(Xb ; Zb )},\n\nfor a joint distribution of the form p(xb ) p(yb , zb |xb )\np(xf ) p(yf , zf |xf ).\n4. Secrecy Rates for the Binary Symmetric\nWiretap Channel with Feedback\nIn this section, we focus on the secrecy rates when\nboth the forward and the backward channels in Fig. 1\nare independent binary symmetric channels (BSCs).\n\nThe system model in this case is fully characterized\nby the four crossover probabilities \u01ebf , \u03b4f , \u01ebb , and \u03b4b ,\ncorresponding to the channels Alice\u2192Bob, Alice\u2192Eve,\nBob\u2192Alice, and Bob\u2192Eve, respectively.\nThis model is also analyzed in [12] in which a secrecy rate based on the transmission scheme proposed\nby Maurer in [9] is proposed: a random binary sequence\nxnb is transmitted by Bob over the backward channel.\nAssuming Alice's coded message is v n , she transmits\nthe modulo sum of v n with the received signal from\nthe backward channel, i.e., xnf = v n \u2295 ybn . If we assume\nthat Alice can transmit xnf over a noiseless channel,\nthen Bob can reconstruct v n \u2295 ybn \u2295 xnb , while the best\nEve can do is to reconstruct v n \u2295ybn \u2295zbn . This is equivalent to a broadcast channel from Alice to Bob and Eve\nwith cross-over probabilities \u01ebb and \u01ebb + \u03b4b \u2212 2\u01ebb \u03b4b , respectively.\nWe propose here to use a combination of Maurer's\nscheme with the proposed scheme in Section 3. The\nmaximum secret key rate that can be generated using\nthe feedback channel is Csb , [h(\u03b4b )\u2212h(\u01ebb )]+ . Bob uses\nthe first \u03b1n channel uses to generate a secret key of rate\n\u03b1Csb , where 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 is a design parameter that can\nbe optimized according to the crossover probabilities in\norder to maximize the total secrecy rate. Bob transmits\nrandom bits in the rest of the feedback channel uses.\nIn the forward channel, we first consider the case\n\u01ebf < \u03b4f . Alice divides the secret message into three\nparts, all of which are transmitted simultaneously. In\nthe first part, Alice transmits a secret message of rate\nR1s = h(\u03b4f ) \u2212 h(\u01ebf )\nover the forward channel using the usual secret coding\nscheme. Alice can simultaneously transmit a message\nat rate 1 \u2212 h(\u01ebf ) \u2212 R1s = 1 \u2212 h(\u03b4f ), which can be received by both Bob and Eve. Alice uses the secure key\nfrom the feedback channel as a one-time-pad to transmit securely to Bob at rate\nR2s = min{1 \u2212 h(\u03b4f ), \u03b1Csb }.\nThe remaining capacity of the forward channel is then\n1 \u2212 h(\u03b4f ) \u2212 R2s = [1 \u2212 h(\u03b4f ) \u2212 \u03b1Csb ]+ . Finally, at this\nrate, Alice transmits a modulo summed message in the\nsame manner as [12], using the random bits received\nfrom the second portion of the feedback channel.

In both cases, the total\nsecrecy capacity is then R1s + R2s + R3s .\nTo illustrate the gains through the proposed feedback technique, we consider a system model with the\nsame crossover probability in the forward and backward\nchannels, i.e. \u01eb = \u01ebf = \u01ebb and \u03b4 = \u03b4f = \u03b4b . In Fig. 2,\nwe plot the achievable secrecy rate by the proposed\ntransmission scheme with optimized \u03b1 as a function of\n\u01eb and \u03b4. As opposed to not having feedback, or using the whole feedback link to generate a secret key,\nthis scheme can achieve positive secrecy rates even in\n\u03b4 > \u01eb as we have partially incorporated Maurer's coding scheme. Note also that, our achievable secrecy rates\nimprove upon the ones reported in [12].\nFigure 3 plots the improvement in the secrecy rate\nof the proposed feedback scheme with respect to the secrecy capacity without feedback. Note that the secrecy\ncapacity without feedback is Cs = [h(\u03b4)\u2212h(\u01eb)]+ . Interestingly, the largest gain is obtained at the point \u01eb = 0\nand h(\u03b4) = 21 , or \u03b4 \u2248 0.11. At this point the secrecy\nrate without feedback is Cs = 12 , while with feedback\nwe achieve Csf = 1, an improvement of one half bit.\nAs \u03b4 \u2192 12 from this point, the secrecy capacity without\nfeedback increases towards one and feedback results in\nless improvement.\n5.

The forward channel at time\nindex i is modeled as\nYi = Xi + Ni and Zi = Xi + Mi ,\nin which Ni and Mi are additive white jointly Gaussian noise terms with zero means. There is also an\naverage power constraint P on Alice's transmission.\nWe also have a perfect feedback channel from Bob's\noutput to Alice that operates causally, i.e., at time instant i, Alice knows Bob's previous channel outputs\nY i\u22121 = {Y1 , . . . , Yi\u22121 }. Eve, on the other hand, can\nonly observe a noisy version of this feedback. The\nfeedback from Bob to Alice, as overheard by Eve, is\nmodeled as\n\u0232i\n\n= Yi + Si ,\n\n(3)\n\nat time i, where Si is also white Gaussian with zero\nmean.

The SK scheme is based on deterministic\ncoding and parameter estimation. We first give a brief\noverview of the SK scheme using the notation of [14].\nIn the SK scheme, 2nR messages are mapped to\na signal point by dividing the interval [\u22120.5, 0.5] into\n2nR equally spaced subintervals. The mid-point of each\nsubinterval corresponds to a message. Let \u03b8 be the\nsignal point corresponding to the underlying message.\nAt the first transmission, X1 = \u03b11 \u03b8 is transmitted, and\nY1 = \u03b11 \u03b8 + N1 is received where \u03b11 is a constant to be\nchosen. The receiver forms an estimate of \u03b8 based on\nits observation as\n\n\u03b8\u03021 = X\u03021 =\n\nY1\nN1\n=\u03b8+\n.\n\u03b11\n\u03b11\n\nY2\nY1\nN2\n+\n=\u03b8+\n.\n\u03b12\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\n(6)\n\nUsing the two independent observations of \u03b8 in (5)\nand (6), the receiver forms \u03b8\u03022 the maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimate of \u03b8. Then the transmitter transmits\nX3 = \u03b13 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03022 ), where \u03b13 is another pre-determined\nconstant. Repeating this process, we have\n\nSi\n\nMi\n\nX\u03022 =\n\n(5)\n\nThe transmitter can also compute this estimate using\nthe perfect feedback signal, and in the next transmission, it transmits the estimation error at the receiver,\n1\ni.e., X2 = \u03b12 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03021 ) = \u2212\u03b12 N\n\u03b11 , where \u03b12 is another\n\n\u03b8\u0302i\n\n= \u03b1i (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0302i\u22121 ),\nYi\n= \u03b8\u0302i\u22121 + , and\n\u03b1i\nPi\n2\n\u03b1\nj=1 j X\u0302j\n=\nPi\n2\nj=1 \u03b1j\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhere (9) is the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate\nof the parameter \u03b8 at Bob from the observations\nY [1], . . . , Y [i].\np\n2\nNow, on choosing\n\u03b1i = \u03b3\u03b1i\u22121 with \u03b3 = P/\u03c3N\nr\n\nand \u03b11 = \u03b1 =\n\n2\nP +\u03c3N\n2\n\u03c3N\n\n, it can be shown that the error\n\u03c32\n\nN\nvariance after n iterations is E[(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0302n )2 ] = \u03b12n\n. For\nnR\nM = 2 , the probability of error, which corresponds\nto the probability of \u03b8\u0302n falling outside of the message\ninterval, can be shown to decay to zero exponentially.\nIn the following theorem, we show that the SK\nscheme also achieves the optimal secrecy capacity.\n\nTheorem 5.1 For the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) wire-tap channel with perfect feedback to the\ntransmitter, the secrecy capacity is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nP\n1\n(10)\nCsf = Cf = log 1 + 2 ,\n2\n\u03c3N\nand this capacity can be achieved by the SK scheme.\nProof: The converse is obvious since the rate in\n(10) is the capacity of the feedback channel without\nsecrecy constraints. Here we prove the achievability of\nthe secrecy capacity in (10) by the SK scheme.\nFix W = {1, . . . , 2nR }, where R = Csf \u2212 \u01eb, for some\n\u01eb > 0. Then we know that the average error probability\ngoes to zero as n \u2192 \u221e for any \u01eb > 0 with the SK\nscheme.\nFrom the SK scheme, we can observe that\nPi\nj=1 \u03b1j Nj\n\u03b8\u0302i = \u03b8 + Pi\n, and\n(11)\n2\nj=1 \u03b1j\nPi\u22121\ni\u22121\nX\nj=1 \u03b1j Nj\nXi = \u2212\u03b1i Pi\u22121\n\u03b1j Nj\n(12)\n= hi\n2\nj=1 \u03b1j\nj=1\n\n\f\u03b1i\nwhere we have defined hi , \u2212 Pi\u22121\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b12j\n\n. The observa-\n\ntions at Eve are then given as Z1 = \u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 and\nZi = \u03b1i\n\ni\u22121\nX\n\nhj Nj + Mi , for i = 2, . . . , n.\n\n(13)\n\nj=1\n\nFinally, the equivocation rate can be written as\nH(\u03b8|Z1n ,\u02321n ) \u2265 H(\u03b8|Z1n , \u02321n , M2n ),\n\nReferences\n(14)\n\n= H(\u03b8|\u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 , \u03b11 \u03b8 + S1 , S2n , N n , M2n ),\n= H(\u03b8|\u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 , \u03b11 \u03b8 + S1 , N1 ),\n(15)\nwhere (14) follows from the fact that conditioning reduces entropy and (15) follows since N2n and M2n are\nindependent of both \u03b8 and \u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 due to i.i.d. channel assumption.\nThe equivocation rate can be further simplified as\nH(\u03b8|Z1n , \u02321n )\n\n\u2265\n=\n\nH(\u03b8|\u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 , \u03b11 \u03b8 + S1 , N1 ),\nH(\u03b8) \u2212 I(\u03b8; \u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 , \u03b11 \u03b8 + S1 , N1 ),\n\n=\n=\n\nnR \u2212 I(\u03b8; \u03b11 \u03b8 + M1 , \u03b11 \u03b8 + S1 , N1 ),\nnR \u2212 I(\u03b8; A\u03b8 + B),\n\nwhere A , [0, \u03b11 , \u03b11 ]T , B , [N1 , M1 , S1 ]T , and where\nwe have used the fact that the message is uniform over\nthe set {1, . . . , 2nR }. The mutual information term in\nthe final expression is difficult to calculate for a uniformly distributed discrete \u03b8, but we know that, allowing for an arbitrary distribution for \u03b8, the mutual\ninformation is maximized for a Gaussian input distribution that has the same variance as \u03b8.
