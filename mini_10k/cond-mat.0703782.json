In this latter case, the leading instability selects a modulation of the order\nparameter at a well defined length scale. This instability will grows and, due to nonlinearity,\nsaturates. The resulting micro-segregated pattern is composed of well defined interfaces\ndelimiting monophasic domains containing one of the two stable phases. These interfaces\nwill then interact with each other and coalesce, during a much slower, self-inhibiting process,\nwhere the number of domains diminishes whereas their typical size increases, ending with the\nformation of either a micro-segregated complex pattern [1], or a single interface separating\ntwo semi infinite domains, one for each new stable phase (macro-segregation).\nHillert[2], Cahn and Hilliard[3] have proposed a model equation describing the segregation\nfor a binary mixture. This model, known as the Cahn-Hilliard equation (C-H later on),\nbelongs to the Model B class in Hohenberg and Halperin's classification [4]. It is a standard\nmodel for phase transition with conserved quantities and has applications to phase transition\nin alloys [2], binary mixtures[5], vapor condensation [6] and liquid crystals[7], segregation of\ngranular mixtures in a rotating drum[8], or formation of sand ripples [9, 10].\nIn this article, by spinodal decomposition, we refer to the first stage of the dynamics only,\nwhile coarsening or Ostwald ripening will denote the second stage. Although this coarsening\ndynamics is in fact already present, its influence can be neglected during the first stage of\nthe process.\nAn important activity has been devoted to the description of the dynamics of phase\ntransition, using experiments, numerical simulations [11] or scaling methods [12]. The late\nstage of the dynamics, where the Ostwald ripening dominates, exhibits \"dynamical scaling\" :\nthe dynamics presents a self-similar evolution where time enters only through a length scale\nL(t), associated with a typical length of the domains. This scaling argument gives the law\nL(t) \u223c t1/3 for spatial dimensions greater than one and a logarithmic behavior in D=1.\n2\n\n\fThis last stage, as observed in two-dimensional demixion of copolymers[13] and as suggested initially by Langer[14], can be described as a process of synchronous fusion and\nevaporation of domains, spatially alternated. It corresponds to the evolution that breaks\nthe least the symmetries of the pattern. This observation motivated our work and the aim\nof this article is to make use of a one dimensional ansatz to describe quantitatively the ideal\ncoalescence process. This ansatz is in the form of a one parameter family of symmetric profiles which interpolates between two stationary states composed of homogeneous domains\nof length \u03bb and 2\u03bb. It allows in 1D to describe a self similar sequence of coalescence and\nevaporation of domains (or of their dual counterparts, the interfaces), starting from the periodic micro-segregated state which ends the spinodal decomposition dynamics, and leading\ncontinuously to either a single interface, or a stable 1D modulated phase.\nThe paper is organized as followed: part 2 will focus on the first part of the dynamics,\ni.e. spinodal decomposition. We will reproduce briefly the original derivation by Cahn\nand Hilliard, restricting ourselves to the one dimensional case, mainly to fix the notations\n(part 2.1). In part 2.2, a family of symmetric solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau equation\nwill be used to study the non linear part of dynamics and in part 2.3 we will identify all\nthe intermediate symmetric stationary states of the (C-H) dynamics. Then in part 3, we\nwill turn to Ostwald ripening : in part 3.1, a non-symmetric family of solutions of the\n(G-L) equation is used to construct a continuous interpolation between two consecutive\nsymmetric stationary states. After a study of the energy landscape associated with this\nansatz (part 3.2), we will compute in part 3.3 the characteristic time associated with one\nstep of coalescence : we will recover the 1D logarithmic law. Before concluding, as an\napplication in part 4, our ansatz will be used, in the case of micro-segregation, to compute\nthe period of the final thermodynamically stable modulated pattern.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE CAHN-HILLIARD MODEL\nA.\n\nLinear stability Analysis\n\nThe Cahn-Hilliard (or Conservative Time Dependant Ginzburg Landau) equation is a\nmodified diffusion equation for the scalar order parameter \u03a8, which reads in its dimensionless\nform:\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u03b5\n\u03b4FGL (\u03a8)\n(r, t) = \u22072\n= \u22072 ( \u03a8 + 2\u03a83 \u2212 \u22072 \u03a8).\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03a8\n2\nThe real order parameter can correspond to the dimensionless magnetization in Ising ferromagnet, to the fluctuation of density of a fluid around its mean value during a phase\nseparation or to the local concentration of one of the components of a binary solution. \u03b5 is\nthe dimensionless control parameter of the system ; it is often identified to the reduced temperature (\u03b5 =\n\nT \u2212Tc\nTc\n\nwhere Tc is the critical temperature of the first order phase transition).\n\nThis equation, first derived by Cahn and Hilliard, has also been retrieved by Langer[14]\nfrom microscopic considerations. A conservative noise can be added to account for thermal\nfluctuations [15], but in this article, we will only consider the noiseless (C-H) equation.\nIt admits homogeneous stationary solutions which are extrema of the symmetric Landau\npotential V (\u03a8) = 4\u03b5 \u03a82 + 12 \u03a84 . For positive \u03b5, there is only one homogenous solution \u03a8 = 0\nwhich is linearly stable. A pitchfork bifurcation can be experienced when quenching the\nsystem from a positive reduced temperature \u03b5 to a negative one : the \u03a8 = 0 solution\nbecomes unstable ; two other symmetric stable solutions appear \u03a8 = \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n.\n2\n\nSpinodal decomposition is the dynamics resulting of such a quench. Cahn and Hilliard\nhave studied the early times of this dynamics by linearizing equation (1) around \u03a8 = 0 (i.e.\nneglecting the non linear term \u03a83 ). Considering \u03a8 as a sum of Fourier modes:\n\u03a8(r, t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03a8q eiq*r+\u03c3t\n\n(2)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03a8q is the Fourier coefficient at t = 0, they obtained for the amplification factor \u03c3(q) :\n\u03b5\n(3)\n\u03c3(q) = \u2212(q2 + )q2\n2\nThis shows immediately that \u03a8 = 0 is linearly stable for \u03b5 > 0 while a band of Fourier\np\nmodes are unstable for negative \u03b5, since \u03c3(q) > 0 for 0 < q < (\u2212\u03b5/2). Moreover, the\n4\n\n\fmost unstable mode is for qC\u2212H =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u03b5/2. This wave number of maximum amplification\n\nfactor will dominate the first stage of the dynamics; this explains in particular why the\nhomogeneous domains appear at length scales close to L = \u03bbC\u2212H /2 = \u03c0/qC\u2212H , half the\nwave length associated with the instability. For longer times, interfaces separating each\ndomain interact through Ostwald ripening, causing < L > to change slowly toward higher\nvalues [11, 16]\nWe will now use known results on non-homogeneous solutions of the (G-L) equation to\nstudy both the saturation of the spinodal decomposition and the coalescence.\n\nB.\n\nStationary States of the Cahn-Hilliard Dynamics : Symmetric Soliton Lattice\n\nSolutions\n\nFor \u03b5 < 0, there exists a whole family of solution of the one dimensional (G-L) equation :\n\u03b5\n\u03a8 + 2\u03a83 \u2212 \u22072 \u03a8 = 0\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThese solutions, the so-called soliton-lattice solutions, are :\nx\n\u03a8k,\u03b5 (x) = k\u2206Sn( , k) with \u03be = \u2206\u22121 =\n\u03be\n\nr\n\n2\n\nk2 + 1\n\u2212\u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Sn(x, k) is the Jacobian elliptic function sine-amplitude, or cnoidal mode. This family\nof solutions is parametrized by \u03b5 and by the Jacobian modulus k \u2208 [0, 1], or \"segregation\nparameter\". These solutions describe periodic patterns of period\nZ \u03c0\n2\ndt\np\n\u03bb = 4K(k)\u03be, where K(k) =\n0\n1 \u2212 k 2 sin2 t\n\n(6)\n\nis the complete Jacobian elliptic integral of the first kind. Together with k, it characterizes\nthe segregation, defined as the ratio between the size of the homogeneous domains, L = \u03bb/2,\nand the width of the interface separating them, 2\u03be. The equation (6) and the relation\n\u03be = \u2206\u22121 , enable to rewrite this family as :\n\u03a8k,\u03bb(x) =\n\n4K(k) * k\n4K(k)\nSn(\nx, k).\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\nAs for k = 1, Sn(x, 1) = tanh(x), we recover the usual solution\np\np\n|\u03b5|\n|\u03b5|\ntanh(\nx).\n\u03a81,\u03b5 (x) =\n2\n2\n5\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n\fp\nassociated with a single interface (or soliton) of width 2/ |\u03b5| that connected the two homogenous phases \u03a8 = \u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u03b5\n.\n2\n\nBecause K(1) diverges, it corresponds to a strong, or macro-\n\nscopic, segregation. In the opposite limit (weak segregation regime), \u03a8k,\u03b5 (x) describes a\nsinusoidal modulation\n\nr\n\nr\n\n|\u03b5|\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nx) = k sin( x) = kq sin(qx)\n(9)\n2\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u221a\n|\u03b5|\n2\u03c0\nIt will correspond to the Fourier mode q = \u03bb = 2 of the initial white noise, with van\u03a8k\u21920,\u03b5 (x) = k\n\n|\u03b5|\nsin(\n2\n\nishing amplitude \u03a8q = kq. Since experiences, numerical simulations and linear stability\nanalysis show that \u03bb, the spatial period of the pattern is constant during the whole spinodal\ndecomposition process, we choose \u03bb to coincide with the most instable wave length obtain\nwith the Cahn Hilliard linear approach, \u03bb = \u03bbC\u2212H =\n\n\u221a4\u03c0 ,\n\u2212\u03b50\n\nwhere \u03b50 is the quench tem-\n\nperature. We then obtain a one parameter family of profiles \u03a8\u2217 (x, k) = \u03a8k,\u03bbC\u2212H (x) which\ndescribe very well both the linear growth and the saturation of the spinodal decomposition\n[17]. Thus, the dynamics is now reduced to the time evolution of the single free parameter:\nk(t). Using equations (5) and (6), we find that \u03bb, k and \u03b5 are related to one another through\nthe state equation\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n4K(k)\n\u03b5(k) = \u22122(1 + k )\n.\n(10)\n\u03bb\nThis implicit equation tells us that if we impose \u03bb = \u03bbC\u2212H , the dynamics can be reduced\n2\n\nto the evolution of \u03b5(t), interpreted as the fictitious temperature or \"local temperature\"\nassociated with the segregation parameter k(t) which characterizes the pattern. This temperature can be extracted from the profile at any time, using the correspondence between\n\u03b5 and k of equation (10). For instance, at t = 0, the amplitude is small and we find that\nk(t = 0) =\n\n\u03a8q \u03bbC\u2212H\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2192 0 and thus \u03b5\u2217 (0) = 8\u03c0 2 /\u03bb2 , different a priori from \u03b50 (\u03b5\u2217 (0) =\n\n\u03b50\n2\n\nfor\n\n\u03bb = \u03bbC\u2212H ) : the system is initially out of equilibrium\nSomehow, the dynamics of (C-H) can be projected at first order onto a dynamics along the\nsub-family \u03a8\u2217 (x, k) = \u03a8k,\u03bbC\u2212H (x), which can be considered as an attractor of the solutions,\ni.e. the density profile of the system will evolve with time, staying always close to a function\n\u03a8\u2217 (x, k). Thus, using equation (4), the (C-H) dynamics reduces to equation :\n\u2202\u03a8\u2217\ndk\n(\u03b50 \u2212 \u03b5(k)) 2 \u2217\n\u2202\u03a8\u2217\n(r, t) =\n(r, k(t))\n=\n\u2207\u03a8.\n\u2202t\n\u2202k\ndt\n2\n\n(11)\n\nThe non linearity has now disappeared into \u03a8\u2217 (x, k). Using a solubility condition, it is\npossible to transform this equation into a differential equation for k(t) and to compute the\n6\n\n\ffull non linear part of this dynamics (i.e. the saturation of the spinodal decomposition),\nwhich leads the system in a well defined stationary state [17].\n\nC.\n\nSaturations of the Spinodal Decomposition Dynamics\n\nThe spinodal decomposition dynamics will saturate when the fictitious temperature \u03b5(t)\nwill reach the real thermodynamic one, i.e. the quench temperature \u03b50 ; that is, using\nequation of state (10) for \u03bb = \u03bbC\u2212H , when k = k0s = 0.687 solution of the implicit equation :\n2(1 + k0s2 )K(k0s )2 = \u2212\n\n\u03b50 \u03bb2C\u2212H\n= \u03c02 .\n16\n\n(12)\n\nUsing linear stability analysis, Langer has shown that the stationary profile thus obtained,\n\u03a8\u2217 (x, k0s ) = \u03a8k0s ,\u03bbC\u2212H (x), is destroyed by stochastic thermal fluctuations. He has identified\nthe most instable mode as an \"antiferro\" mode, leading to a period doubling. The result of\nthis destabilization is another periodic profile of alternate interfaces of period \u03bb = 2\u03bbC\u2212H ,\nwhere the length of the domains is : L = \u03bb/2 = \u03bbC\u2212H . This means that the new stationary\nprofile is given by \u03a8k1s ,2\u03bbC\u2212H (x), where k1s = 0.985 is solution of the implicit relation\n2(1 + k1s2 )K(k1s )2 =\n\n\u2212\u03b50 (2\u03bbC\u2212H )2\n= 4\u03c0 2 .\n16\n\n(13)\n\nAgain, this new stationary profile turns out to be linearly instable with respect to an \"antiferro\" perturbation of period 4\u03bbC\u2212H .\nThus these families of profiles and instabilities enable to describe the one dimensional\ncoarsening as a cascade of doubling process.

We could have chosen\nother ways of representing this long-range interaction, but the inclusion of such a term,\nfollowing Oono, enables to describe the behavior of modulated systems at T much lower\nthan Tc , as we will show below. If we suppose for example that in a 3D problem, the long\nrange interaction decreases like 1r , the full free energy density writes\nZ\n1\n\u03b5 2\n1 4\n2\nF (\u03a8) = FGL + Fint = (\u2207\u03a8(r)) + \u03a8 (r) + \u03a8 (r) + \u03a8(r \u2032 )g(r \u2032, r)\u03a8(r)dr \u2032 ,\n2\n4\n2\nwhere g(r \u2032 , r) =\n\n\u03b22\n.The\n|r \u2032 \u2212r|\n\n(35)\n\nlong range interaction g(r \u2032 , r) corresponds to a repulsive inter-\n\naction when \u03a8(r \u2032) and \u03a8(r) are of the same sign : thus it favor the formation of interphases.\nIf we want to study the dynamic of this phase separation, we use the Cahn-Hilliard equation :\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u03b50\n\u03b4F (\u03a8)\n2\n2\n3\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= \u2207r\n(36)\n= \u2207r\n\u03a8 + 2\u03a8 \u2212 \u2207 \u03a8 + \u03a8(r )g(r , r)dr .\n\u2202t\n\u03b4\u03a8\n2\nIf one recalls that\n\n\u22121\n|r \u2032 \u2212r|\n\nis the Green's function associated with the Laplacian operator \u22072r\n\nin 3D, the preceding equation then transforms into\n\u0013 Z\n\u0012Z\nZ\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03a8(r \u2032 )\u03b4(r \u2032 , r)dr \u2032 = \u2212\u03b2 2 \u03a8(r).\n\u2207r\n\u03a8(r )g(r , r)dr = \u03a8(r )\u2207r g(r , r)dr = \u2212\u03b2\n(37)\nwhich leads to equation (34).

Contrary to [11], our ansatz relies on the hypothesis that during the first\nstage of the dynamics, the periodicity of the order parameter remains constant, while during\neach steps of the coarsening process, it is the parameter k which remains constant. In a\nsense, there are adiabatic ansatzs : the generation of higher harmonics is governed solely by\nthe time evolution of k(t) during the non linear saturation of the spinodal decomposition\nand later on solely by \u03c6(t) during the Ostwald ripening. The validity of the assumptions\nhave been investigated in details and checked numerically [17].\nOur analytic method rely on the assumption that at each step of the dynamics, the system\ncan be characterized by a specific spatial period : we need therefore to discuss how this\napproach is relevant to the general case where noise is present. We have noted numerically\nthat, for the spinodal decomposition, the average size of the modulation is \u03bbC\u2212H , with a\ndeviation of less than one percent from the value predicted by the linear theory. It does\nnot mean that, in a real system, each domain has a length scale of L = \u03bbC\u2212H /2, but that\nthe distribution of the domains' length will be centered around L. The coalescence events\ncan be neglected during the initial growth of the amplitude of the modulation : as all\nthe eigenvalues of the Lam\u00e9 operator (28) are then positive, the dynamics remains within\nthe ansatz subfamily \u03a8\u2217 (x, k). Only after this initial growth has saturated, turns negative\nthe lowest eigenvalue ; the coalescence process then starts, and dominates the forthcoming\ndynamics.\nWe have computed in this article the characteristic time associated with one step of ideal\ncoalescence. By ideal coalescence, we mean a process which breaks as few symmetries as\npossible. In a real system, because of initial fluctuations in the periodicity of the pattern\nselected just after the quench, this instability will concern only region of finite size, where\nit choose a certain sublattice, or a range for \u03c6 (for example, \u03c6 varies from 0 to 1), while it is\nthe opposite choice in the neighboring region ( \u03c6 varies from 0 to -1). The global symmetry\nis thus recover on the overall (as in an antiferromagnet). During each step of the process,\nthe width of the domains will locally double; but for the system as a whole, due to non\nsynchronization between regions, the average length scale will vary continuously.\n13\n\n\fWe have also shown that in a modified version of the Cahn-Hilliard dynamics, which take\ninto account long range interactions, the computation of this lowest eigenvalue enables to\ncompute that the spatial period of the thermodynamically stable modulated phase will be\n\u03bb=\n\n\u221a8\n\u2212\u03b50\n\n\u03b52\n\nln( 2\u03b202 ).\n\nThe use of the solubility technics combined with the choice of an adiabatic ansatz might be\ngeneralized to the study of other non linear dynamics. For instance, spinodal decomposition\nin superfluid Helium or Bose condensate has been argued to be described by a cubic-quintic\nnon linear equation[24] ; in this particular case, one needs to retrieve a relevant soliton-like\nfamily of solution along which to compute the adiabatic dynamics. The same difficulties\nwould arise as well when the method will be adapted to higher space dimensions as there is\nno equivalent to soliton lattice in 2D; the ansatzs (16) and (21) could however be used in a\nnumerical simulation as tools for following the dynamics.\nIt might also be possible to extend this approach to non symmetric profile like the ones\nintroduced in different contexts[19, 25]. Or for the cases of special quenches which are time\nperiodic [26] or spatially periodic [27].\nI would like to thanks Christophe Josserand, Avadh Saxena and David Andelman for\nfruitful discussions and Turab Lookman for bringing to me ref [23].\n\n[1] M.
