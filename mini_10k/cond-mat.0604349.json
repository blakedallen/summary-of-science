We are particularly interested to analyze the\ninfluence of excitonic and of unbound electron-hole-pair populations on the photo luminescence (PL) emitted at the\nspectral position of the exciton resonances.\nExtensive experimental research in the past few decades has shown that one observes excitonic resonances in the\nPL of a QW for different material systems and for a very broad range of excitation conditions ranging from cryogenic\n(about 4 K) all the way to room temperatures.1,2 A PL resonance at the lowest 1s-exciton state has also been observed\neven when the exciton ionizaton density is exceeded. For example, experiments with GaAs-type QW systems at 4 K\nlattice temperature show a clear excitonic resonance at the 1s position for a density range 108 cm\u22122 to 5 \u00d7 1010 cm\u221223 ;\nhere, the lower density is only limited by the sensitivity in detection while the upper value is already beyond the\nionization density.\nThe build-up of excitonic PL is often investigated in a configuration where the semiconductor is excited nonresonantly using ultrafast laser pulses that generate carriers into the high-energy states of the bands. Thus, all coherences\nvanish almost instantaneously and the direct generation of 1s excitons can be excluded. Using this scheme, it has\nbeen observed4,5 that an excitonic 1s PL resonance builds up on a subpicosecond timescale. Furthermore, excitonic\nPL is observed longer than several nanoseconds, which also implies that electron-hole pairs exist in the system for a\nvery long time.\nIn order to explain some of the observe phenomena, Ref.6 developed a simple microscopic model for the semiconductor PL showing that also an electron-hole plasma, i.e. a system with nonvanishing electron and hole densities\nbut no excitons, can produce PL spectra that peak at the exciton resonances. This prediction releases the previously\nassumed strict relation between the existence of exciton populations and the appearance of excitonic PL such that\none can explain why excitonic PL is also observed under conditions where the presence of real exciton populations\nseems unreasonable.\nIn order to present a more complete analysis, we show in this paper how one can analyze self-consistently the\nelectron-hole plasma and exciton-population effects in the QW PL. We show that in order to perform a reliable\nanalysis, one has to evaluate not only the PL but also the corresponding absorption spectra recorded under equivalent\nconditions. Ideally, one should also measure the induced terahertz (THz) response7,8,9,10,11,12 .\nBased on our microscopic analysis, we determine criteria under which exciton population effects are observed and\nwhen electron-hole plasma contributions are dominant. We also discuss the Coulomb-induced nonlinearities observable\nin PL for elevated densities. For this purpose, one clearly has to perform a quantitative analysis where the microscopic\nscattering, electron-hole plasma, and possible exciton populations have to be included microscopically. The developed\nanalysis allows us to determine systematic criteria for a measured combination of absorption and PL to judge how\nmuch of a given PL spectrum can be attributed to excitonic and/or electron-hole plasma emission.\nThe discussion in this paper is organized as follows. We first present our general quantum theory for PL from\ncoexisting electron-hole plasma end exciton populations. We show how this approach, with microscopic Coulomb\nscattering, can be formulated to compute the PL from quasi-stationary semiconductor populations consisting of a\ngiven exciton and electron-hole plasma population. We evaluate our theory numerically for a two-band QW model\nand present a detailed analysis of the exciton and electron-hole-plasma contibutions to the luminescence. We discuss\ndifferent levels of simplifying approximations and emphasize the importance of the frequency and density dependent\nscattering. Finally, we summarize our results and use them to analyze experimental data. In the Appendices, we\npresent technical details regarding the microscopic description of excitons and the density and frequency dependent\n\n\f2\nscattering calculations.\nII.\n\nMICROSCOPIC THEORY OF EXCITONIC LUMINESCENCE\n\nWe formulate our microscopic theory for the incoherent emission of a planar quantum well. In our calculations, we\nconcentrate on PL resulting from recombinations involving only two bands, i.e. the energetically lowest conduction\nand the heavy-hole band. Multi-band effects can in principle be included in the theory, but they complicate the\nnotation and do not contribute to the essence of our analysis. In the numerical evaluations, we use typical GaAs\nQW material parameters and choose the QW confinement such that the 2s resonance is 6 meV above the 1s state as\nobserved in recent experiments.13,14,15,16 For semiconductors, the microscopic description of carrier excitations can\nbe obtained with the help of the fermionic operators ac,kk and a\u2020c,kk for conduction-band electrons and av,kk and\na\u2020v,kk for valence-band electrons having momentum kk in the QW plane. The quantized light field is described by\nbosonic operators Bqk ,q\u22a5 and Bq\u2020 k ,q\u22a5 related to free space eigen modes with momentum q = (qk , q\u22a5 ) that is divided\ninto the qk component in the QW plane and q\u22a5 perpendicular to the QW. The full system Hamiltonian of the\ninteracting carrier-photon system is discussed e.g. in Refs. 17,18 and the relating microscopic PL dynamics is derived\nin Refs. 6,10,18,19,20,21,22. Here, we therfore present only a brief summary of the elements important for our analysis\nof excitonic PL.\nSince we want to compute PL from incoherent quasiparticle excitations, we concentrate on conditions where the\ncoherent polarization and the coherent fields hBq i vanish. We also assume that the system is homogeneously excited\nand quasi stationary. For such conditions, the single-particle distributions\nfkek \u2261 ha\u2020c,kk,c ac,kk i,\n\nfkhk \u2261 hav,kk a\u2020v,kk i,\n\n(1)\n\nfor the electrons and holes can be taken as constant.\nThe relevant two-particle correlations in the incoherent regime are excitonic and pure intraband carrier\ncorrelations.10,20 For the study of PL, we only need to evaluate the excitonic correlations defined as\nqk ,k\u2032k ,kk\n\ncX\n\n\u2261 \u2206ha\u2020c,kk a\u2020v,k\u2032 ac,k\u2032k +qk av,kk \u2212qk i\nk\n\n= ha\u2020c,kk a\u2020v,k\u2032 ac,k\u2032k +qk av,kk \u2212qk i \u2212 ha\u2020c,kk a\u2020v,k\u2032 ac,k\u2032k +qk av,kk \u2212qk iS ,\nk\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\nwhere the subtracted single-particle contribution ha\u2020\u03bb a\u2020\u03bd a\u03bd \u2032 a\u03bb\u2032 iS is obtained by using the usual Hartree-Fock approximation ha\u2020\u03bb a\u2020\u03bd a\u03bd \u2032 a\u03bb\u2032 iS \u2261 ha\u2020\u03bb a\u03bb\u2032 iha\u2020\u03bd a\u03bd \u2032 i \u2212 ha\u2020\u03bb a\u03bd \u2032 iha\u2020\u03bd a\u03bb\u2032 i.\nThe incoherent photon correlations and the microsocpic source for the PL are obtained from the photon-assisted\nelectron-hole recombination and the photon-number-like correlations\n\u03a0kk ,qk ,q\u22a5 \u2261 \u2206hBq\u2020 k ,q\u22a5 a\u2020v,kk ac,kk +qk i\n\n= hBq\u2020 k ,q\u22a5 a\u2020v,kk ac,kk +qk i \u2212 hBq\u2020 k ,q\u22a5 iha\u2020v,kk ac,kk +qk i,\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2032 i \u2261 hB\n\u2032 i \u2212 hB\n\u2032 i,\n\u2206hBq\u2020 k ,q\u22a5 Bqk ,q\u22a5\nqk ,q\u22a5 Bqk ,q\u22a5\nqk ,q\u22a5 ihBqk ,q\u22a5\n\n(3)\n\nrespectively. These are obtained by subtracting the classical factorizations from the full expectation values.

Since (f \u2212 f \u03bd ) is much smaller than (1 \u2212 f e \u2212 f h ) for low enough densities, Drest has a\nmuch smaller effect on the exciton correlations than the main-sum terms for conditions where bound excitons still\nexist.20 Thus, we may apply the main-sum approximation where Drest is omitted when we compute the excitonic\nPL.\n\u2032\nBesides the two-particle correlations, Eq.

The first term in the second line of Eq. (10) shows that photon-assisted recombination processes can be seeded either by an electron-hole plasma population (f e f h ) or an exciton correlation term\n(cX ). Since these spontaneous emission sources do not depend on the photon frequency, both plasma and exciton\ncorrelation sources contribute to the PL in the same spectral range.\nThe second term in Eq. (10) shows that the photon-assisted recombination processes for different momentum\ncombinations are coupled via the Coulomb interaction. This renormalization determines the emission frequency\nsimilar to the classical field renormalization in the semicondcutor Bloch equations17,22,24,25 . Since this Coulomb\ncorrelation effect is not at all related to the specific spontaneous emission source, even the existence of bare electron\nand hole densities leads to emission of light at the bound exciton frequencies. When the QW is not inside a cavity,\nthe stimulated feedback term, \u2206hB \u2020 B\u03a3 i, in Eq. (10) is negligible. The explicit form of the three-particle scattering\nterm, T \u03a0 , is discussed in Appendix B.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nExcitons vs. correlated electron-hole plasma\n\nAs a very broad definition, an exciton is a quasi-particle that consist of a bound electron-hole pair. This interpretation is seemingly simple and straightforward. However, once one seriously considers the fact that an exciton has\na fermionic substructure, as is done in Eq. (4), one realizes that one can neither define a pure exciton operator nor\na rigorous number operator for excitons in a fermionic many-body system.26 As a working definition, we speak of\nan exciton in a many-particle system if at least one electron depends on a hole in a correlated manner, where the\ncorrelation is in the relative motion coordinate. The pair wavefunction is determined from the Wannier equation that\nis analogous to the generalized Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the hydrogen. The bound state solutions define the bound\nexcitons while the ionized states define ionized excitons.\nThe Wannier equation in momentum space is equivalent to the Fourier transform of the Hydrogen equation, but can\ncontain additional energy renormalizations and a phase-space filling factor if a finite amount of carriers is present.17\nAs shown in Appendix A, it is even possible to incorporate carrier scattering in the Wannier equation and thus obtain\nexcitonic quasi-particles including Coulomb scattering effects. In the presence of carriers, both the phase-space filling\nfactor and the microscopic scattering make the corresponding eigenvalue problem non-Hermitian, such that a leftL/R\nhanded and a right-handed basis set (\u03a6\u03bd,qk ) must be introduced, see Appendix A. There, we show that the definition\nof true excitons can be mathematically formulated by using the transformations\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22c6 q ,k\u2032 \u2212q ,k +q\nX\ne\nh\nk\nk\nL\n\u2032\n,\n(12)\ncX k\n\u2206N\u03bb,\u03bd (qk ) =\n\u03a6L\n(k\n)\n\u03a6\n(k\n)\nk\n\u03bb,qk\n\u03bd,qk\nk\nkk ,k\u2032k\n\nqk ,k\u2032k ,kk\n\ncX\n\n\u0011\u22c6\nX\u0010\n\u2032\n=\n\u03a6R\n\u03a6R\n\u03bb,qk (kk \u2212 qe )\n\u03bd,qk (kk + qh )\u2206N\u03bb,\u03bd (qk ),\n\n(13)\n\n\u03bb,\u03bd\n\nwhere the excitonic center-of-mass momentum has been split symmetrically via\nqe =\n\nme\nqk ,\nme + mh\n\nqh =\n\nmh\nqk .\nme + mh\n\n(14)\n\nIn particular, the diagonal elements,\n\u2206N\u03bb (qk ) \u2261 \u2206N\u03bb,\u03bb (qk ),\n\n(15)\n\ndefine the momentum distribution for excitons in state \u03bb.\n10,23\nThe physical\nto probe\nP relevance of these quantities can be verified by analyzing THz absorption which is shown\nexclusively qk \u2206N\u03bb (qk ) under incoherent conditions. More precisely, each exciton state can be connected with a\npopulation\n\u2206n\u03bb =\n\n1X\n\u2206N\u03bb (qk )\nS q\n\n(16)\n\nk\n\nand a 1s-to-2p resonance in the linear THz absorption shows unambiguously that the 1s state is initially populated.\nIn full analogy to the optical transitions in atomic systems, the strength of the resonance is directly related to the\npopulation difference between the initial \u2206n1s and the final \u2206n2p states. Thus, THz spectroscopy shows that \u2206n\u03b2\ndefines the exciton density of a given state in the same way as one can count atoms occupying different atomic states\nby using optical spectroscopy.\nIn general, exciton correlations can also exhibit nondiagonal \u03bb 6= \u03bd contributions in \u2206N\u03bb,\u03bd . As shown in Ref.20 ,\nthese off-diagonal parts build up on a pico-second timescale and can be identified with a correlated plasma while the\ndiagonal exciton populations are formed much more slowly. In the present publication we include microscopic Coulomb\nscattering beyond the constant dephasing and we include both diagonal and non-diagonal exciton correlations.\nB.\n\nIncoherent quasiparticle states\n\nAs already argued in13 , it is essential to analyze the experimental PL together with absorption spectra obtained\nunder identical conditions. Since many experiments measure PL in the normal direction, we consider this configuration\nhere. Using our formalism, we establish a connection between the quasi-particle state and the measured spectra in\norder to determine the conditions and excitation parameters where excitonic populations significantly influence PL\nexperiments.\n\n\f5\nWhen a weak classical optical pulse, E(t), is applied to probe the incoherent excitation state of a semiconductor, it\ndoes not alter electron, hole, or exciton populations. The probe pulse interacts with the system, merely by inducing\nthe optical (probe) polarization Pkk \u2261 ha\u2020v,kk ac,kk i in the system. Thus, we need to solve the polarization dynamics\nfrom the semiconductor Bloch equations17,24\niX\nh\n\u2202\nVk\u2032k \u2212kk Pk\u2032k\nih\u0304 Pkk = \u01eb\u0303kk Pkk \u2212 1 \u2212 fkek \u2212 fkhk\n\u2202t\n\u2032\nkk\n\ni\nh\n\u2212 1 \u2212 fkek \u2212 fkhk dc,v E(t) \u2212 i\u0393kk\n\n(17)\n\nwhich contains two-particle Coulomb- and phonon-induced scattering terms in \u0393kk .

In fact, the relative contribution of\nthe electron-hole plasma to the excitonic PL can be identified by quantifying how strongly the actually measured PL\ndeviates from the thermodynamic limit.\nUnder quasistationary conditions, the steady-state PL emitted in normal direction, qk = 0, is obtained from\nEq.

However, as the major\ndifference, the semiconductor PL has as its incoherent source the combination of carrier densities f e f h and exciton\ncorrelations while the optical polarization is driven by the coherent field E(\u03c9).\nThe incoherent quasi-particle correlations enter Eq.

(18), (23) and (26).\nSince these equations include also carrier-carrier scattering, energy renormalizations and phase-space filling factors, a\nsuitable exciton basis clearly must go beyond the usual low-density Wannier wavefunctions.\nThe basis set for solving Eqs.

Due to their occurence and because of the phase-space\nfilling factor, Eq. (28) is clearly non-Hermitian such that we have to distinguish between left- and right-handed basis\nfunctions.

However, in the present paper, we always solve the absorption with the full\nsource term, Eq. (32).\nDue to the structural similarity between the semiconductor Bloch Eq. (18) and the luminescence Eq.

Nevertheless, we will see later that it still gives a qualitative picture around the 1s resonance.\nThe second contribution looks exactly like the exciton transformation defined in Eq. (13). However, before proceeding further, we first look at the solution of the last remaining Eq. (26), which determines the electron-hole correlations\nentering in the source of Eq. (36). This equation can also be simplified by introducing a suitable electron-hole pair\nbasis, but the scattering for the cX -equation is different from the scattering entering in the previous two equations.\nIn particular, the scattering matrices are not frequency dependent since we assume stationary excitonic correlations.\nTherefore, Eq. (26) should be diagonalized with an exciton basis obtained by using the correct excitonic scattering\nL/R\nmatrices in the matrix in Eqs. (29) and (28). We denote this second exciton basis set by \u03a6\u03bc (kk ). Expressing the\nexcitonic correlations cX in the PL source, Eq.

Thus, the total luminescence source\nis given by the sum of Eqs. (37) and (38). In the spirit of Eq. (25), the correlated source \u2206S\u03bd,\u03bc (\u03c9) can describe a\ncorrelated plasma or true exciton populations. In general, we refer to plasma PL, if we include only the correlated\nplasma from Eq. (26).to the PL source \u2206S\u03bd,\u03bc (\u03c9). True excitonic PL is obtained after we add additional excitons\n\u2206N\u03bd = \u2206hX\u03bd\u2020 X\u03bd i to the source term.\nIn all our computations, we include the Hartree-Fock source as well as the plasma correlations including the correct\nmicroscopic scattering, unless stated otherwise. However, in order to gain some more physical insight to the meaning\nof Eq. (35) and only for that purpose, not for the numerical evaluations, one may simplify the microscopic\nscattering by replacing it with a phenomenological decay constant \u03b3. As a result, the exciton basis sets \u03c6\u03bd and \u03a6\u03bd\nbecome identical and basis as well as eigenvalues become independent of \u03c9. Furthermore, we may apply the result\nfrom Eq. (27) for the correlated electron-hole plasma. By inserting it into Eqs. (35)\u2013(36) and using Eq. (37), we\nobtain a simple Elliott-like formula for luminescence,\nPL\nIElliott\n(\u03c9) \u221d |dcv |2\n\nX |\u03c6R (r = 0)|2 S Elliott\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nE\n(\u03c9)\n\u2212\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\u2212\ni\u03b3\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\nwith the source term given by\n\u0012X\n\u0013\n\u2020\nElliott\nL\n2 e\nh\nS\u03bd\n=\nX\u03bd,0 i = N\u03bdHF (q = 0) + \u2206N\u03bd (q = 0).\n|\u03c6\u03bd (kk )| fkk fkk + \u2206hX\u03bd,0\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\nkk\n\nWe now see very clearly that excitonic PL can result either from excitons or directly from electron and hole densities.\nThe form of Eq. (40) is very useful when one envisions the differences of plasma and exciton PL. For example, Ref. 18\nshows that plasma PL from Fermi-Dirac distributions produces an exponentially decaying tail for energies above the\nfundamental gap. This feature survives also when the scattering is fully included such that one can deduce rather\naccurately the temperature of electron and hole distributions directly from the PL spectra.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe full microscopic form of the semiconductor absorption and luminescence equations shows that excitonic resonances can appear under quite different conditions. Clearly, Coulombic scattering can strongly broaden these resonances. We also notice that the scattering terms contain highly nonlinear contributions of the carrier densities. We\ntherefore start by investigating these excitation-induced dephasing effects28,29 on different excitonic resonances.\nA.\n\nExcitation-induced dephasing\n\nWe first illustrate the influence of the microscopic scattering on the higher bound states by evaluating the fully\nmicroscopic absorption and PL spectra for various carrier densities. More specifically, we assume Fermi-Dirac distributions at 40 K for electrons and holes and take three very low values for the densities which are usually all considered\nto be in the \"linear regime\". In addition to the microscopic Coulomb scattering, we have included a small background\n\u03b3 = 0.125 meV which results from the effects of acoustic phonon scattering and the purely radiative decay. Figure 1\npresents absorption and PL spectra side by side showing that the 1s-exciton resonance lies 8 meV below the band\ngap. For the densities used here, it is hardly changed and its width is basically determined by the background decay\nconstant. But while the 1s-exciton resonance is almost unchanged even for the largest density used here, the magnifications in the insets clearly demonstrate a very strong broadening of the 2s-exciton resonance. The absorption\nspectra show that the 2s resonance merges with the continuum already at around 109 cm\u22122 , a density which is usually\nconsidered very low in typical GaAs-type QW systems. The same trend is visible in the PL spectra where it is\nalmost impossible to detect a clear 2s resonance, instead it merely marks the onset of the exponential decay into the\ncontinuum. This fact explains why the 2s resonance is often not cleary observable in experiments.\nThe relation between excitonic resonances and nonlinearities can be investigated most easily if we define the separate\ncontributions of Eqs. (31) and (35) via\nX\n\u03b1(\u03c9) =\n\u03b1\u03bd (\u03c9)\n(41)\n\u03bd\n\nI\n\nPL\n\n(\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\u03bd\n\nI\u03bdPL (\u03c9)(\u03c9)\n\n(42)\n\n\f9\n\nIm(c) [arb. u.]\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n8\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n0.3\n\nIPL/n2 [arb. u.]\n\n6\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nhn-EG [meV]\nFIG. 1: Absorption (top) and PL spectra (bottom) for a carrier temperature of T = 40 K for three different carrier densities\nof n = 5 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 (shaded area), n = 1 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 (solid line), and n = 6 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 (dashed line).

However, since the eigenenergies\nand broadenings are frequency dependent, this simple form is in fact somewhat misleading. Due to the frequency\ndependence of the complex excitonic eigenvalues the generalized Lorentzian function can in reality deviate quite\nstrongly from a simple Lorentzian - even more so since in general the oscillator strength in the numerator can be\ncomplex and thus mix real and imaginary parts of the energy denominator.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the same three absorption spectra as in Fig. 1 as thick solid lines. But now, we also plot\n\u03b11s , \u03b12s and the rest separately. Since the excitonic states have a complicated \u03c9 dependence due to the scattering\nmatrices, we identified the 1s and 2s resonances by choosing at each \u03c9 those two excitonic states which have the\nhighest oscillator strength. Especially for higher densities, we find an entire continuum of excitonic states; some of\nthem have a relatively small oscillator strength. But a clear distinction of the different states, as in the zero-density\nanalytical Wannier formula, is no longer possible.\nEven for the lowest density, the 2s resonance is strongly non-Lorentzian and extends well into the continuum.\nReversely, even the higher lying continuum states contribute significantly (almost a quarter) to the observed 2s peak.\nFor the intermediate density, this effect becomes even more pronounced and for the highest density, it is no longer\npossible to determine a clear resonance. This becomes understandable if we look at the vertical lines in the figure\nwhich indicate the positions of the real parts of the eigenvalues. For low densities these real parts agree with the\nexpected energies of the 1s, 2s etc. states. However, we see that for elevated densities the microscopic scattering\nleads to resonances even between the 1s and 2s energies. For the highest density, these resonances can extend down\nto the 1s peak itself.\n\n\f10\n\nIm(c) [arb. u.]\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\nIm(c) [arb. u.]\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nIm(c) [arb. u.]\n\n0\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nhn - EG [meV]\n\nFIG. 2: Absorption spectra for a carrier temperature of T = 40 K for three different densities of n = 5 \u00d7 108 cm\u22122 (top),\nn = 1 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 (middle), and n = 6 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 (bottom). In addition to the full spectrum (solid line), the separate\ncontribution for the 1s resonance (dotted line), the 2s resonance (shaded area), and the rest (dashed line) is given. The vertical\nlines display the real parts of the excitonic eigenenergies of the generalized Wannier Eq. (28).\n\nExactly the same analysis as before is performed for our PL spectra. For the intermediate density, the result is\ndisplayed in Fig. 3. All features discussed in Fig. 2 are clearly visible also here. The excitonic positions are the same as\nin the absorption analysis, since the exciton basis for semiconductor Bloch and luminescence equations are identical.\nAs we have already mentioned in the discussion of Fig. 1 a clear 2s resonance cannot be distinguished. It is composed\nof a whole cluster of resonances and has to be analyzed with a full microscopic theory. A zero-density Wannier basis\nis clearly insufficient to understand these intricate effects.\nFigure 4 presents an important part of the information necessary to understand the strong non-Lorentzian lineshape\nfeatures. Here, we show the frequency dependence of the broadening of the two bound states with the highest oscillator\nstrength. For simplicity, we continue to call the second resonance a 2s resonance in analogy to the usual Wannier\nnomenclature. Our observation from the spectra are confirmed here; while the 1s resonance is almost independent of\nfrequency and dominated by the background decay constant \u03b3bg = 0.125 meV, the broadening of the second resonance\nis strongly frequency dependent. At the frequency value where the maxima of the corresponding resonances are\nobserved (indicated by the vertical lines) the broadening of the second is already about five times as big as that of\nthe first resonance. The fact that this broadening decays more quickly towards lower frequencies than towards higher\nfrequencies explains the non-Lorentzian feature and the larger extension of the 2s resonance towards the continuum\nstates. At the same time, the small 1s broadening is consistent with the observed narrow Lorentzian line from\nFigs. 1\u20133.\nThis explanation covers only part of the non-Lorentzian lineshape. By looking at Eqs. (31) and (35) we note that\nfundamentally the influence of scattering can be even more complicated. Since the presence of scattering generally\nleads to complex wave functions and correlations A\u03bd,\u03bc and S\u03bd,\u03bc , even the oscillator strength can be complex and real\nand imaginary parts, i.e. broadened \u03b4-function and principal value contributions in the complex Lorentzian functions\ncan be mixed.\nBefore turning our attention to more details of the PL spectra, we summarize the important finding of this section.\n\n\f11\n\nIPL [arb. u.]\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n\n0\n-12\n\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nhn - EG [meV]\n\nGn [meV]\n\nFIG. 3: PL spectrum and the different contributions for the same parameters as the middle frame of Fig. 2.\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0\n-8\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nhn-EG [meV]\nFIG. 4: Imaginary part of excitonic eigenenergy of the generalized Wannier Eq.

The vertical lines indicate the respective real parts.\n\nWe have noted that both in absorption and in PL the so-called \"2s resonance\" actually consists of a whole cluster of\nenergetically close resonances. Except for ultra-low densities the usual nomenclature fails and the 2s resonance is not\nnecessarily the second lowest bound state. Microscopic Coulomb scattering leads to the presence of a continuum of\nstates, sometimes even relatively close to the 1s-exciton resonance.\nB.\n\nPlasma luminescence spectra\n\nSince we have seen in the previous section that the analysis of the 2s resonance is a rather delicate issue, we start\nour detailed investigation of PL spectra by comparing different approximations and their influence around the 1s\nresonance. This resonance is modified much less by Coulomb scattering than the 2s resonance such that we can\nanticipate it to be more robust under different approximations applied.\nIn the present section, all PL spectra are computed from Eq. (35) with the Hartree-Fock source, Eq. (37), and\nthe correlated plasma contribution obtained from Eq. (26). We do not add additional diagonal exciton populations\nuntil the next section where the ratio between excitonic and plasma luminescence is investigated. For comparison,\nwe also present solutions of the simplified Elliott formula, Eq. (39), where the decay constant is chosen such as to\nmatch the width of the 1s resonance of the full computation. Within the Elliott formula approach, there are three\n\n\f12\ndifferent possibilities to deal with the four-point cX correlations. The best and most consistent way is the full solution\nof Eq. (26) with the scattering matrices replaced by a constant \u03b3. The other two possibilities truncate already part\nof the four-point terms and can thus lead to inconsistencies at higher bound or continuum states. We include them\nhere for comparison only and in order to relate previous results to the full theory. In the simplest case, we can neglect\nthe cX correlations completely. Then we obtain spectra in the same approximation as in our first publications30 ,\nreferred to in the present paper as \"Hartree-Fock\" approximation. We can improve this approximation by solving\nthe four-point correlations in a scattering approach as has been discussed in Sec. 4.4 of Ref. 18. In that case, the\nfour-point correlations are obtained as\n0,k\u2032 ,kk\ncX k\n\n\u2032\n\nscat\n\n=\n\n\u01eb\n\n\u2212S 0,kk,kk\n\nqk ,k\u2032k ,kk\n\n(45)\n\n\u2212 i\u03b3\n\nwith the definitions from Eqs. (5) and (8). As can be seen from the energy denominator, Coulomb resonances are\nnot included in the description of the electron-hole correlations in that approximation. Hence, we have four different\nways to calculate the 1s PL: the fully consistent plasma result from Eq. (26) with microscopic scattering matrices,\nthe same with a constant \u03b3 approximation (Elliott), and then two approximations where either Eq. (26) is truncated\nand solved without the Coulomb sums (scattering approximation) or where the four-point correlations are neglected\ncompletely (Hartree-Fock).\n\nIPL [arb. u.]\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.02\n\n0\n\n-9\n\n-8\n\n-7\n\nhn - EG [meV]\n\nFIG. 5: PL spectrum in the spectral vicinity of the 1s resonance. The full result from Eq. (35) (shaded area) is compared to\nthree different approximations of the Elliott formula with constant dephasing, Eq. (39). Here, the correlated PL source term\nis treated fully (solid line), in scattering approximation (dashed line), or set to zero (Hartree-Fock approximation, dark-shaded\narea). The constant-gamma results have been shifted by 40 \u03bceV in order to collocate the peaks at the same frequency.\n\nFigure 5 presents the PL spectra around the 1s resonance for these four different ways of computing the excitonic\ncorrelations. All approximations exhibit a clear peak at the 1s resonance. A small shift of 40 \u03bceV for the three\nconstant-gamma calculations compensates small differences in the energy renormalizations with and without microscopic scattering. While the Hartree-Fock approximation gives only about one third of the full plasma PL, the other\ntwo approximations are within 30% of the full plasma value. Since we adjusted the decay constant, we can directly\ncompare the peak heights in order to compare the quality of the different approximations. This is done in detail\nin Fig.6 for the two carrier temperatures of T = 20 K and T = 60 K. For both temperatures, the Eliott formula\napproaches the full plasma PL for very low densities, deviates most strongly at some intermediate densities, before\ngetting better again in the limit of higher densities. The maximum deviation is temperature dependent and is less\nthan 40% for 20 K and even smaller around 25% for 60 K. The Hartree-Fock approximation shows a similar functional\nform, but is in general too small by a factor of around three to four, with the precise value also depending on carrier\ndensity and temperature. The scattering approximation decays monotonously from low to high densities. For very low\ndensities, it can even overestimate the correct value of the plasma luminescence as can be anticipated by extrapolating\nthe curve to zero density. For high densities, it is too small by less than a factor of two.\n\n\f13\n1\n0.8\n\nIPL/Ifull\nPL\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n1\n\nIPL/Ifull\nPL\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n2 x 10 9\n\n4 x 10 9\n\n6 x 10 9\n\n8 x 10 9\n\n1 x 10 10\n\n-2\n\nn [cm ]\n\nFIG. 6: Relative peak height of Elliott formula (solid line), second-Born source (dashed line), and Hartree-Fock source term\n(dotted line) relative to the peak height of the full plasma result with microscopic scattering.

The full plasma PL (solid line) and the\nElliott-formula result are compared to the thermodynamic limit (shaded area).\n\nC.\n\nExcitonic plasma luminescence\n\nThe results in Sec. III B show that the intensity of the 1s-plasma PL can be predicted rather accurately using\ndifferent levels of approximations. We next quantify the characteristics of the 1s PL with respect to other resonances\nin the spectrum. Especially, we may use the thermodynamic relation (21) between \u03b1(\u03c9) and PL(\u03c9) to define how\nnonthermal the excitonic plasma PL is. The computed full (solid line), Elliot (dashed line), and thermodynamic\n\n\f14\n(shaded area) PL are presented in Fig. 7. Here, the carrier density has been taken as 109 cm\u22122 and the lattice\ntemperature is 40 K. The shown thermodynamic PL is simply obtained by computing the microscopic absorption\nfrom Eq. (31). Then, \u03b1(\u03c9) is multiplied by a thermal factor according to Eq. (21). The temperature is chosen such\nthat the high-energy PL tails of the full and the thermodynamic computations agree.\nWe observe now that event though the full and the Elliot PL agree at the 1s resonance, the Elliot PL overestimates\nthe high-frequency part of the spectrum since microscopic Coulomb scattering is not included. This is a clear indication\nthat one needs to include the microscopic scattering to understand the quantitative features in the full spectral range\nof the excitonic PL. A comparison of the full and the thermodynamic PL indicates that the excitonic plasma PL is\nstrongly nonthermal since it produces a much weaker 1s resonance than thermodynamic arguments predict. We will\nsee, later on, that one actually needs true 1s-exciton populations to enhance the 1s PL toward its thermodynamic\nvalue. The inherent nonequilibrium feature of the excitonic plasma luminescence has a simple explanation. It is\nintuitively clear that 1s emission from plasma or correlated electron-hole plasma is more complicated than from\nexciton populations. This complication arises from the fact that an electron-hole plasma can emit a photon at\nexcitonic frequencies, which are much below its average energy per particle, only by heating the remaining plasma.\nDue to this additional difficulty, the excitonic PL resulting from a pure plasma is generally weaker than that for the\npure thermodynamic limit containing also exciton populations.\n\n80\n\n1\n3\n\nT [K]\n\n60\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n5\n40\n1\n12\n20\n1e+09\n\n1e+10\n\nn [cm -2 ]\nFIG. 8: \"Phase-space\" plot for \u03b2-factor as function of carrier density and temperature. The temperature has been determined\nfrom the continuum tail of the emission.\n\nTo quantify the level of nonthermal character in more detail, we define a \u03b2 suppression factor,\n\u03b2\u2261\n\nPL1s |full\n,,\nPL1s |TD\n\n(46)\n\nfirst introduced by Schnabel et al.31 . Essentially, the \u03b2 factor tells us how strongly the actual 1s PL, PL1s |full , is\nsuppressed with respect to its thermodynamic value PL1s |TD . Figure 8 presents a contour plot of \u03b2 as function of\ncarrier density and temperature when only the fully mictroscopically included plasma luminescence is included. As a\ngeneral tendency, the plasma PL becomes strongly nonthermal for low densities and temperatures. This is the regime\nwhich is favourable to sustain truly bound excitons. As temperature and/or density are increased, the excitonic\nplasma PL approaches the thermodynamic limit.\nAs a general tendency, the \u03b2 analysis has a rather weak sensitivity to the scattering model used or to low levels of\ndisorder.32 Thus, the \u03b2 analysis is very much suitable to analyze the plasma nature of experimentally detected PL. In\nother words, the presented \u03b2-phase diagram can be applied to diagnose the degree to which the measured PL in lowdisorder GaAs-type samples is caused by plasma emission. On the basis of a quantitative analysis of simultaneously\nmeasured PL and absorption, Refs.13,33 have shown that the experimental results for temperates above 30 K and\ndensities above 5 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 can be attributed to pure plasma emission.\n\n\f15\nD.\n\nExciton-population effects\n\nUnder suitable conditions a system of incoherent electron-hole quasi-particle excitations consists a mixture of\ncorrelated electron-hole plasma and exciton populations. Clearly, exciton populations may appear in all exciton\nstates including the ionization continuum. In particular, the full thermodynamic equilibrium between plasma and\nexcitons leads to a many-body problem34,35 that produces highly nontrivial many-body states. However, several\nrecent experiments13,31,33 demonstrate that excitonic PL is almost always far from the purely thermodynamic limit.\nThus, it seems realistic to assume that the correlated electron-hole plasma coexists together with a fraction of excitons\nthat is determined by the exciton formation kinetics and typically much below its thermodynamic value. Since the\n1s-exciton populations dominate at low temperatures, we include only them in our analysis of the exciton population\ncontribution to the PL.\nAs discussed in Sec. III C, the PL at the 1s resonance can be strongly enhanced by the presence of true exciton\npopulations. This can be seen directly from the luminescence Elliot formula (39). More precisely, a 1s-exciton population basically adds luminescence at the 1s frequency whose magnitude increases as a linear function of the exciton\noccupation \u2206N1s . In order to investigate this effect, we add 1s exciton populations to the fully microscopically computed correlated plasma luminescence. We assume that the added 1s excitons have a thermal momentum distribution\nsuch that \u2206N1s (0), i.e. the 'bright part' of the exciton distribution that contributes to the luminescence in normal\ndirection, is known. In practice, the population \u2206N1s (0) is added to the source (25) such that the fully microscopic\nluminescence is solved from Eqs. (35) for the coexisting exciton and plasma populations.\n\nIPL [arb. u.]\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\nhn - EG [meV]\n\nFIG. 9: PL spectra for a carrier density of n = 1 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 and a nominal carrier temperature of T = 20 K. The full plasma\nresult (solid line) is compared to the thermodynamic curve (shaded area). Adding 1% excitons at a temperature of TX = 10 K\n(dashed line) drastically increases the 1s PL.\n\nTo illustrate the basic effect of exciton populations, we assume a low carrier density of 109 cm\u22122 and 20 K carrier\ntemperature. Since the excitons can often reach a lower temperature than the carrier distributions, we choose a 10 K\ntemperature for the excitons. Figure 9 shows PL without excitons (solid line), 1% excitons (dashed line), and the\nthermodynamic limit (shaded area). We notice that in all cases, the PL spectra are qualitatively similar, especially,\nthe PL above the second resonance is virtually the same. Hence, the main feature of 1s populations is that they\nincrease the 1s PL toward the thermodynamic limit. This confirms our previous assumption that exciton populations\nmust be included to produce a thermodynamic PL.\nWe investigate next how much the 1s PL is changed by a 1% fraction of 1s excitons as function of total carrier\ndensity. As in Fig. 9, we assume a 10 K exciton temperature.

(39), the low-density plasma PL scales with the product\nof the carrier occupations, f e f h , while the exciton population PL is directly proportional to the occupation \u2206N1s .\nWhen the carrier temperature is increased or the carrier density is decreased, the absolute magnitude of the plasma\nPL decreases nonlinearly. If the exciton occupation has a fixed temperature, as we have assumed in Fig. 10, the\nrelative strength of the population PL increases with respect to the plasma PL as the density is lowered or the carrier\ntemperature is increased. Thus, the observed increase of RX follows directly from the nonlinear dependence of the\nplasma PL for low densities. In particular, the exciton populations can contribute strongly under low temperature\nand low density conditions as verified in recent experiments.13,33\n\nn X / n e [%]\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n2 x 10\n\n9\n\n4 x 10\n\n9\n\n6 x 10\n\n9\n\n8 x 10\n\n9\n\n1 x 10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nn [cm ]\n\nFIG. 11: Necessary exciton fraction to be added in order to obtain a ratio of 3/2 between the 1s-resonance peaks with and\nwithout additional excitons.

We observe again that low carrier densities are sensitive to the presence of exciton populations while their\neffect becomes less important for elevated temperatures and densities. The difference of low vs. high temperature can\nbe understood on the basis of the same nonlinearity arguments as in Fig. 10.\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nExcitonic PL resulting from an electron-hole plasma has been observed in a variety of experiments performed with\nGaAs-type QW systems. For example, the ultrafast build up of the 1s-luminescence resonance on a subpicosecond time\nscale REF is a clear indication of emission from a relaxing electron-hole plasma. The formation times of incoherent\nexciton poplulations are much longer. This has been carefully analyzed recently in experiments where absorption and\nPL spectra have been measured simultaneously.13,33 The microscopic analysis of these experiments not only verify\nthat excitons are formed on a time scale of several hundred picoseconds but they also showed that appreciable exciton\npopulations are obtained only for temperatures below 30 K and densities below 1010 cm\u22122 . Otherwise, the excitonic\nPL could be explained by our plasma PL alone.\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\nn1s /ne [%]\n\n12\n8\n4\n\n0\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nT [K]\n\nFIG. 12: Top: A comparison between the data points from Fig. 5 of Phys. Rev. B 71, 195313 (2005) and the thermodynamic\nresult as obtained from analysing either peak heights (dashed) or areas (dot-dashed line) of 1s and higher resonances, respectively. Our result without (dotted) and with (solid) added excitons obtained from the peak-height analysis has been added.\nBottom: Necessary exciton fraction for an excitonic temperature of TX = 10 K used for the top part of the figure.\n\nIn order to check these interpretations, we analyze the experimental data published recently in Ref.16 . In Fig. 12,\nwe have carefully read in all experimental data points from Fig. 5 in Ref.16 We compare these date to our full theory\nand several levels of approximation. We first compute the 1s-to-2s ratio by integrating the thermodynamic result,\nEq. (21), obtained from our absorption spectrum for a density of 109 cm\u22122 . If we determine the ratio by integrating a\nspectral range of 8 meV around each resonance as has bene done in Ref. 16, we obtain the dot-dashed line; if we plot\nthe peak ratio instead, we get the dashed line. The area ratio lies well below almost all of the experimental data points.\nOne can think of a large variety of possible explanations, which include radiative effects (the sample is measured in\nreflection geometry in front of a distributed-Bragg-mirror) or possible disorder effects which could potentially enhance\nthe 1s emission relative to the rest. In order to proceed with our analysis, we therefore use the peak ratio as a\nreference, which lies clearly above most of the experimental data points. The results of our luminescence theory\nfor various temperatures is plotted in Fig. 12 before and after adding additional excitons to our plasma PL. The\nnecessary fraction of excitons needed to obtain our fit is given in the bottom panel. Already the plasma theory nicely\nagrees with the experimental results for elevated temperatures above 40 K. And for lower temperatures we find that\nexciton populations do indeed contribute significantly. Even though we do not have access to the full experimental\ninformation, this comparison shows that the experimental results can be well explained with our theory, in contrast\nto the claims in Ref. 16. For a detailed one-to-one analysis, the carrier density for each data point should be obtained\n\n\f18\nin the experiment as well.\nAs an alternative experimental route, also THz experiments11 performed under similar conditions show unambiguously that 1s-exciton populations are formed on a nanosecond time scale. Recently, also a combination of PL and\nTHz absorption measurements has been reported.12 There it has been shown that a 1s-exciton resonance can indeed\nbe seen in the PL even when THz absorption does not exhibit a 1s \u2212 2p resonance indicating unambiguously that\n1s-exciton populations are not present under these conditions.\nBoth the strong non-thermal nature of PL spectra and the excitonic PL without a corresponding THz absorption\nsignal can easily be explained if one includes the plasma PL in the analysis. While varying in importance, this\ncontribution is fundamentally always present since it only requires that carrier distributions are excited. The strength\nof the present theory is to simultaneously treat effects from both the electron-hole plasma and the excitons by fully\nincluding the Fermionic substructure of the excitons. Only such a combined analysis without exclusive restriction\nto one of the possible emission sources can answer the question which source is important under given experimental\nconditona.\nTo summarize, in the present paper we have discussed and evaluated our microscopic theory for calculating PL\nspectra of semiconductor QW systems and for analyzing exciton and plasma contributions to luminescence, respectively. We have particularly focused on the effects of microscopic Coulomb scattering and analyzed their influence on\nthe different exciton resonances. While the PL Elliott formula, Eq. (39), elucidates the underlying physics, a realistic\ntheory-experiment comparison should always include microscopic scattering, in particular if the detailed structure\naround the band-edge is of special interest. A desirable extension of our theory would be to simultaneously include\nthe exciton formation dynamics and the PL in a systematic way. Even though the theoretical framework exists, the\nnumerical implementation of such a theory is very demanding and requires a lot of additional work and improved\ncomputer resources.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by the Optodynamics Center of the Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg and by the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft through the Quantum Optics in Semiconductors Research Group.\nAPPENDIX A: MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF EXCITONS\n\nBased on the four-point definition in Sec. II A, we find a natural way to identify incoherent excitons once we evaluate\nthe electron-hole pair-correlation function\ngeh (rk ) \u2261 h\u03a8\u2020e (rk )\u03a8\u2020h (0)\u03a8h (0)\u03a8e (rk )i,\n1 X\n1 X\n\u03a8e (rk ) = \u221a\nac,kk eikk *rk , \u03a8\u2020h (rk ) = \u221a\nav,kk eikk *rk ,\nS k\nS k\nk\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nk\n\nwhere only the envelope part of the field operator \u03a8\u0302\u03bb (rk ) is included since the Wannier excitons depend on a length\nscale much longer than the lattice periodic part of the Bloch functions. In general, geh (rk ) defines the conditional\nprobability to find an electron at position rk when the hole is positioned at the origin. Thus, properties of geh (rk )\ncan identify what kind of correlations one can observe in the relative coordinate between the electrons and holes in\nthe many-body system.\nThe pair-correlation function can always be divided into single-particle as well as to correlated two-particle contributions and the homogeneous incoherent quasiparticle excitation conditions produce\ngeh (rk ) \u2261 ne nh + \u2206geh (rk ),\n1 X qk ,k\u2032k ,kk i(k\u2032k +qk \u2212kk )*rk\n\u2206geh (rk ) \u2261 2\ne\n.\ncX\nS\n\u2032\n\n(A3)\n(A4)\n\nkk ,kk ,qk\n\nWe observe now that the single-particle factorization leads to a background contribution, ne nh , which states that\nprobability of finding electron and hole simultaneously is proportional to the product of their respective densities.\nThis contribution does not have a genuine rk -dependence. As a result, the true exciton effects are observed only in the\ncorrelated two-particle contributions \u2206geh (rk ) which contains exclusively the cX correlation. Thus, it is obvious now\nthat only cX contributions can define and include the microscopic description of the true excitons in the many-body\nsystem.\n\n\f19\nThe correlated \u2206geh (rk ) can also be expressed in the exciton basis\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX 1X\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22c6 R\n\uf8ed\n\u2206N\u03bb,\u03bd (qk )\uf8f8 \u03c6R\n\u2206geh (rk ) =\n\u03bb (rk ) \u03c6\u03bd (rk ).\nS q\n\u03bb,\u03bd\n\n(A5)\n\nk\n\nP\n2\nWhen \u2206geh (rk ) exhibits a clear single-state r-dependence proportional to |\u03c6R\n\u03bb0 (rk )| , it is obvious that the\n\u03bb,\u03bd sum\nis dominated by the element \u03bb = \u03bd = \u03bb0 . Since this case corresponds to having only \u03bb0 excitons, we may conclude\nthat\n1X\n(A6)\n\u2206N\u03bb0 ,\u03bb0 (qk )\n\u2206n\u03bb0 \u2261\nS q\nk\n\ndefines the density of excitons in state \u03bb0 in the system.\nAPPENDIX B: MICROSCOPIC SCATTERING\n\nIn order to get a realistic density dependence for the saturation of different excitonic resonances, it is important\nto include Coulomb scattering on a microscopic level. For completeness, we start by investigating the scattering for\ncomputation of absorption spectra, i.e. for the microscopic polarizations hPk i = hvk\u2020 ck i.\nIn the language of the cluster expansion, Coulomb scattering is provided by coupling of n-point expectation values\nto (n + 2)-point expectation values. In the case of the microscopic polarization, we find\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u2202\n\u2020\nih\u0304 hPk i\nc\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck i\n=\nVq \u2206hvk\u2020 c\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i \u2212 \u2206hvk+q\n\u2202t\nscatt\nk\u2032 ,q\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u2020\n+\nVq \u2206hvk\u2020 vk\u2020 \u2032 vk\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i \u2212 \u2206hvk+q\nvk\u2020 \u2032 vk\u2032 +q ck i .\n(B1)\nk\u2032 ,q\n\nThis equation is still exact, and the level of approximation is determined by the precision with which we calculate the\nfour-point correlations. Their dynamics is determined by an equation of the general form\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u2206h4i = S[h2i] + T [h2i, \u2206h4i] + V [\u2206h6i],\n\u2202t\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere the four-point correlations are driven by a source term S[h2i] containing only sums and products of two point\nterms (such as microscopic carrier occupations and polarizations), they are coupled to other four-point correlations in\na complicated manner symbolized by T [h2i, \u2206h4i] and they are themselves coupled to yet higher order terms due to\nthe hierarchy problem. The scattering approximation to this equation is obtained if all coupling between four-point\nterms and to six-point terms is neglected and only the kinetic energy contribution and the two-point source term is\nkept on the right-hand side. Formally, the scattering solutions can thus be obtained from\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u2206h4i\n\u2202t\n\nscatt\n\n= (\u03b5\u0303 \u2212 i\u03b4)\u2206h4i + S[h2i],\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere we have introduced a phenomenological dephasing constant \u03b4 in addition to the sum of renormalized free-particle\nenergies \u03b5\u0303.\nMore specifically, we obtain\nih\u0304\n\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u2206hvk\u2020 c\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i = \u03b5\u0303ek\u2212q + \u03b5\u0303hk + \u03b5\u0303ek\u2032 +q \u2212 \u03b5\u0303ek\u2032 \u2212 i\u03b4 \u2206hvk\u2020 c\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i + Sk,k\u2032 ,q\n\u2202t\n\n(B4)\n\nwith the singlet source given by\n\u0001\ne\ne\nSk,k\u2032 ,q = (Vq \u2212 Vq+k\u2032 \u2212k ) fke\u2032 (1 \u2212 fke\u2032 +q )(1 \u2212 fk\u2212q\n) + (1 \u2212 fke\u2032 )fke\u2032 +q fk\u2212q\nhPk i\n\u0001\ne\ne\nh\ne\ne\nh\n\u2212Vq fk\u2032 (1 \u2212 fk\u2032 +q )(1 \u2212 fk ) + (1 \u2212 fk\u2032 )fk\u2032 +q fk hPk\u2212q i\n\u0001\ne\ne\nhPk\u2032 +q i.\n) + (1 \u2212 fke\u2032 )fkh fk\u2212q\n+Vq+k\u2032 \u2212k fke\u2032 (1 \u2212 fkh )(1 \u2212 fk\u2212q\n\n(B5)\n\nHere, we have neglected source terms in third order in hPk i which is suitable for a low intensity probe pulse. In general,\nwe want to calculate the susceptibility for a specific carrier density in a pump-probe type experiment relatively long\n\n\f20\n(up to nanoseconds) after the pump pulse. After the fast initial scattering, the carrier distributions are known to\nbe changing very slowly and can thus be assumed constant. In that case, we do not have to apply the Markov and\nrandom-phase approximation as has often been done in the past. Instead, we see that the quantity \u0393k (\u03c9) which we\nintroduced in the main part of the paper in Eq. (17), is nothing but the Fourier transform of the right-hand side of\nEq. (B1). This quantity can be split into two parts, \u0393ck and \u0393vk , corresponding to the first and second line of Eq. (B1),\nrespectively.\nBeginning with the computation of \u0393ck , we need the Fourier transform of Eq.

In this case, the\nphoton-assisted two-point quantities couple to photon-assisted four point quantities in the form\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u2202\n\u2020\n=\nVq \u2206hb\u2020q vk\u2020 c\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i \u2212 \u2206hb\u2020q vk+q\nih\u0304 \u2206hb\u2020q Pk i\nc\u2020k\u2032 ck\u2032 +q ck i\n\u2202t\nscatt\nk\u2032 ,q\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u2020\nvk\u2020 \u2032 vk\u2032 +q ck i .\n(B13)\n+\nVq \u2206hb\u2020q vk\u2020 vk\u2020 \u2032 vk\u2032 +q ck\u2212q i \u2212 \u2206hb\u2020q vk+q\nk\u2032 ,q\n\nAs before, one has to set up equations of motion for these photon-assisted four-point terms which couple to yet higher\ncorrelations. In order to obtain a scattering approximation of the photon-assisted 4-point terms, we only keep the\nrenormalized kinetic energies and the main sources. These sources are similar as in Eq. (B5), but due to the presence\nof the photon operator many more factorization possibilities can occur. Under fully incoherent conditions, however,\nwhere we require expectation values of coherent quantities such as hb\u2020 i, hPk i or hb\u2020 c\u2020 ci to vanish, the only remaining\nterms have exactly the form of Eq. (B5) where each polarization has to be replaced by the corresponding photon\nassisted polarization.\nIn the case of PL, we expect a steady-state solution since the source term of PL changes adiabatically and can\nbe assumed constant. Nevertheless, the photon operator in each term provides a frequency dependence via the free\nrotation of the photon operator via\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u2206hb\u2020q \u00d4i\n\u2202t\n\nem\n\n= \u2212h\u0304\u03c9q \u2206hb\u2020q \u00d4i\n\n(B14)\n\nfor each carrier operator \u00d4. When we set the left-hand side to zero, we find the same frequency dependence as for\nthe Fourier transformation of the polarization equation.\nConsequently, the scattering matrices for photon-assisted polarizations are identical to those for the microscopic\npolarization and the scattering denoted by Tk,q in Eq. (10) in the main text can be expressed as\nX\nOD\n\u2020\nTk,q = \u2212i\u03b3kD (\u03c9q )hb\u2020q Pk i + i\n\u03b3k,k\n(B15)\n\u2032 (\u03c9q )hbq Pk\u2032 i,\nk\u2032\n\nin full analogy to Eq. (B10).\n2.\n\nScattering for excitonic correlations\n\nFor the calculation of PL we need to know the excitonic correlations within the radiative cone, i.e. with infinitesimal\ncenter of mass momentum. In the main text they are called\n\u2032\n\n,k\nc0,k\n= \u2206hc\u2020k vk\u2020 \u2032 ck\u2032 vk i = \u2206hc\u2020k vk vk\u2020 \u2032 ck\u2032 i = \u2206hPk\u2020 Pk\u2032 i.\nX\n\n(B16)\n\n\f22\nAt this point, we can briefly address different approximations for the excitonic correlations. If we completely neglect\nexcitonic correlations in the PL source term of Eq. (35), we recover the old Hartree-Fock result6 . If instead we set\nup the equations of motion for the excitonic correlations in the form of Eq. (B2) and treat them on a scattering level\nby neglecting all coupling to four- and six-point terms, we can formally solve for cX and express the correlations\nas functional of carrier densities. In the main text this is refered to as scattering approximation of the excitonic\nsource terms. Since photon number operators and photon-assisted correlations themselves are four-point operators,\nboth approximations are fundamentally inconsistent since they neglect other four-point terms. This can be seen\nas negative PL at the continuum (scattering approximation) or even at higher bound states (Hartree-Fock), but\nnevertheless a qualitatively correct picture is obtained around the 1s-resonance.\nIn a consistent approximation, all four-point terms have to be treated on the same footing. Thus, the two-point\nsources and the four-point terms of Eq. (B2) have to be solved and approximations are only introduced on the next\nlevel, for the six-point quantities describing scattering of excitonic correlations. Thus, we have to set up equations of\nmotion for six-point quantities of the form\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u2206h6i\n\u2202t\n\nscatt\n\n= (\u03b5\u0303 \u2212 i\u03b4)\u2206h6i + S[h2i, \u2206h4i],\n\n(B17)\n\nwhere we keep the free-particle energy and the source term consisting of products of two and four-point expectation\nvalues. Its precise form results from factorizing eight-point terms as e.g. hc\u2020k vk\u2020 \u2032 c\u2020k\u2032\u2032 c\u2020l cl+q\u2032 ck\u2032\u2032 +q\u2212q\u2032 ck\u2032 vk\u2212q i. It turns out\nthat all factorized sources contain at least one four-point correlation. Due to the indistinguishability of the quantized\ncarriers, the general factorization procedure analogous to the previous two subsections leads to a huge variety of\ndifferent triplet scattering terms. In particular, carrier operators belonging to one polarization operator in Eq. (B16)\ncan be split into two different expecation values. The full Coulomb scattering including all those source terms includes\nall quantum effects due to the Fermionic character of the excitons as well as possible momentum scattering between\ndifferent excitons. This full scattering scenario is currently not feasible in two dimensions. Therefore, we make\nthe assumption that scattering acts only within one of the polarization operators of Eq. (B16). In analogy to the\nprevious section of photon-assisted polarizations, we assume that the second polarization operator remains unchanged\nand is not split into different expectation values. Under this assumption, the derivation of the scattering proceeds\nanalogously as before, the number of scattering terms is also identical, and the only major difference is the lack of a\nfrequency dependence of excitonic correlations. Thus, we obtain exciton scattering of the form\nih\u0304\n\n\u0010\u0002 \u0003\u22c6\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2202 0,k\u2032 ,k\n,k\ncX\n= \u2212i \u03b3\u0303kD + \u03b3\u0303kD\u2032 c0,k\nX\n\u2202t\n\u0011\nX \u0010\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n,k\nOD \u22c6 0,k ,k\n+i\n\u03b3\u0303k,k\ncX\n+ \u03b3\u0303kD\u2032 ,k\u2032\u2032 c0,k\n.\n\u2032\u2032\nX\n\n(B18)\n\nk\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nElectronic address: walter.hoyer@physik.uni-marburg.de\nR.
