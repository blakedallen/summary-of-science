In addition to the dynamics of the collective\ndegree of freedom, the magnetization, the nonequilibrium\nbehavior manifests itself in the quasi-particle degrees of\nfreedom that are driven out of equilibrium by the nonzero\nbias voltage. Due to this, the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem13,14 cannot be applied to the quasi-particles.\nThis, in part, has led to controversy surrounding the theory of current-induced domain wall motion15,16 .\nEffective equations of motion for order-parameter\ndynamics that do obey the equilibrium fluctuationdissipation theorem often take the form of Langevin\nequations, or their corresponding Fokker-Planck\nequations13,14,17 . In the context of spintronics the relevant equation is the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert\nequation for the magnetization direction18,19,20,21,22,23,24 .\nIn this paper we derive the generalization of this equation to the nonzero-current situation, for a simple\nmicroscopic model consisting of a single spin coupled\nto two leads via an onsite Kondo coupling. This model\nis intended as a toy-model for a magnetic impurity\nin a tunnel junction25,26,27 . Alternatively, one may\nthink of a nanomagnet consisting of a collection of\nspins that are locked by strong exchange coupling.\nThe use of this simple model is primarily motivated\nby the fact that it enables us to obtain analytical\nresults. Because the microscopic starting point for\ndiscussing more realistic situations has a similar form,\nhowever, we believe that our main results apply qualitatively to more complicated situations as well. Similar\nmodels have been used previously to explicitly study\nthe violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation28 ,\n\nTeff/T\n\narXiv:0705.1432v3 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 4 Feb 2008\n\nR.A.

The inset shows the bias-voltage\ndependence of the Gilbert damping parameter normalized to\nthe zero-bias result.\n\nand the voltage-dependence of the Gilbert damping\nparameter27 . Starting from this model, we derive an\neffective stochastic equation for the dynamics of the\nspin direction using the functional-integral description\nof the Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym nonequilibrium theory29 .\n(For similar approaches to spin and magnetization\ndynamics, see also the work by Rebei and Simionato30 ,\nNussinov et al.31 and Duine et al.32 .) This formalism\nleads in a natural way to the path-integral formulation\nof stochastic differential equations33,34 . One of the\nattractive features of this formalism is that dissipation\nand fluctuations enter the theory separately. This allows\nus to calculate the strength of the fluctuations even\nwhen the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not valid.\nWe find that the dynamics of the direction of the spin\nis described by a Langevin equation with a damping ker-\n\n\f2\n\n\u03bc L,T\n\n\u03bc R,T\n\nII.\n\nS\nFIG. 2: Model system of a spin S connected to two tightbinding model half-infinite leads.

We give explicit\nexpressions for the damping kernel and the correlation\nfunction of the stochastic magnetic field that are valid\nin the entire frequency domain. In general, they are not\nrelated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In the\nlow-frequency limit the Langevin equation takes on the\nform of the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation.\nMoreover, in that limit it is always possible to introduce\nan effective temperature that characterizes the fluctuations and the equilibrium probability distribution for the\nspin direction. In Fig. 1 we present our main results,\nnamely the bias-voltage dependence of the effective temperature and the Gilbert damping parameter. We find\nthat the Gilbert damping constant initially varies linearly with the bias voltage, in agreement with the result of Katsura et al.27 . The voltage-dependence of the\nGilbert damping parameter is determined by the density of states evaluated at an energy equal to the sum\nof the Fermi energy and the bias voltage. The effective\ntemperature is for small bias voltage equal to the actual\ntemperature, whereas for large bias voltage it is independent of the temperature and proportional to the bias\nvoltage. This bias-dependence of the effective temperature is traced back to shot noise35 .\nEffective temperatures for magnetization dynamics have been introduced before on phenomenological grounds in the context of thermally-assisted\ncurrent-driven magnetization reversal in magnetic\nnanopillars36,37,38 . A current-dependent effective temperature enters in the theoretical description of these\nsystems because the current effectively lowers the energy\nbarrier thermal fluctuations have to overcome. In addition to this effect, the presence of nonzero current alters\nthe magnetization noise due to spin current shot noise35 .\nCovington et al.39 interpret their experiment in terms of\ncurrent-dependent noise although this interpretation is\nstill under debate30 . Foros et al.35 also predict, using a\ndifferent model and different methods, a crossover from\nthermal to shot-noise dominated magnetization noise for\nincreasing bias voltage. Our main result in Fig. 1 is an\nexplicit example of this crossover for a specific model.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We\nstart in Sec. II by deriving the general Langevin equation\nfor the dynamics of the magnetic impurity coupled to two\nleads. In Sec. III and IV we discuss the low-frequency\nlimit in the absence and presence of a current, respectively. We end in Sec. V with our conclusions.\n\nDERIVATION OF THE LANGEVIN\nEQUATION\n\nWe use a model that consists of a spin S on a site\nthat is coupled via hopping to two semi-infinite leads, as\nshown in Fig. 2. The full probability distribution for the\ndirection \u03a9\u0302 of the spin on the unit sphere is written as a\ncoherent-state path integral over all electron Grassmann\nfield evolutions \u03c8 \u2217 (t) and \u03c8(t), and unit-sphere paths\nS(t), that evolve from \u2212\u221e to t and back on the so-called\nKeldysh contour C t . It is given by29\nZ\nh\ni\nd[S] \u03b4 |S|2 \u2212 1 d[\u03c8 \u2217 ]d[\u03c8]\nP [\u03a9\u0302, t] =\nS(t)=\u03a9\u0302\n\n\u00d7 exp\n\n\u001a\n\ni\nS[\u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8, S]\n~\n\n\u001b\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the delta functional enforces the length constraint\nof the spin. In the above functional integral an integration over boundary conditions at t = \u2212\u221e, weighted\nby an appropriate initial density matrix, is implicitly included in the measure. We have not included boundary\nconditions on the electron fields, because, as we shall see,\nthe electron correlation functions that enter the theory\nafter integrating out the electrons are in practice conveniently determined assuming that the electrons are either\nin equilibrium or in the transport steady state.\nThe action S[\u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8, S] is the sum of four parts,\nh\ni\nh\ni\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\nS[\u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8, S] = S L \u03c8 L , \u03c8 L + S R \u03c8 R , \u03c8 R\ni\nh\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\u2217\n+ S C \u03c80 , \u03c80 , \u03c8L , \u03c8L , \u03c8R , \u03c8R\nh\ni\n\u0001\u2217\n(2)\n+ S 0 \u03c80 , \u03c80 , S .\nWe describe the leads using one-dimensional noninteracting electron tight-binding models with the action\ni\n\u0011\u2217\nh\u0010\nS L/R \u03c8 L/R , \u03c8 L/R =\n\uf8f1\nZ\n\uf8f2X \u0010\n\u0011\u2217\n\u2202 L/R\nL/R\ndt\u2032\n\u03c8j,\u03c3 (t\u2032 ) i~ \u2032 \u03c8j,\u03c3 (t\u2032 )\n\uf8f3\n\u2202t\nt\nC\nj,\u03c3\n\uf8fc\nX \u0010 L/R \u0011\u2217 L/R \uf8fd\n\u03c8j,\u03c3 (t\u2032 ) \u03c8j \u2032 ,\u03c3 (t\u2032 ) ,\n(3)\n+J\n\uf8fe\n\u2032\nhj,j i;\u03c3\n\nwhere the sum in the second term of this action is\nover nearest neighbors only and proportional to the\nnearest-neighbor hopping amplitude J in the two leads.\n(Throughout this paper the electron spin indices are denoted by \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 {\u2191, \u2193}, and the site indices by j, j \u2032 .)

This means that the noisy magnetic field \u03b7(t)\ncorresponds to a Stratonovich stochastic process13,14,17 .\nThe stationary probability distribution function generated by the Langevin equation in Eqs. (38) and (40) is\ngiven by the Boltzmann distribution18,19,20,21,22,23,24\n(\n)\nE(\u03a9\u0302)\nP [\u03a9\u0302, t \u2192 \u221e] \u221d exp \u2212\n,\n(41)\nkB T\nwith\nE[\u03a9\u0302] = \u2212h * \u03a9\u0302 ,\n\n(42)\n\nthe energy of the spin in the external field. It turns\nout that Eq. (41) holds for any effective field h =\n\u2212\u2202E[\u03a9\u0302]/\u2202 \u03a9\u0302, and in particular for the case that E[\u03a9\u0302] is\nquadratic in the components of \u03a9\u0302 as is often used to\nmodel magnetic anisotropy.\nIt is important to realize that the equilibrium probability distribution has precisely this form because of\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which ensures that\ndissipation and fluctuations cooperate to achieve thermal equilibrium13,14 . Finally, it should be noted that\nthis derivation of the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert\nequation from a microscopic starting point circumvents\nconcerns regarding the phenomenological form of damping and fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which is subject\nof considerable debate22,23 .\nIV.\n\nNONZERO BIAS VOLTAGE\n\nIn this section we consider the situation that the chemical potential of the left lead is given by \u03bcL = \u03bc + |e|V ,\nwith |e|V > 0 the bias voltage in units of energy, and\n\u03bc = \u03bcR the chemical potential of the right lead. Using\nthe general expressions given for the response functions\nderived in Sec. II, it is easy to see that the imaginary\npart of the retarded and advanced components of the\nresponse functions are no longer related to the Keldysh\ncomponent by means of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in Eq. (34). See also the work by Mitra and Millis28\nfor a discussion of this point. As in the previous section,\nwe proceed to determine the low-frequency behavior of\nthe response functions.\nUsing Eqs. (26), (27), and (30) we find that the retarded and advanced components of the response function are given by\n\u03a0(\u00b1) (\u01eb) = \u2213\n\n\u0003\ni \u0002 2\nA (\u03bc + |e|V ) + A2 (\u03bc) \u01eb .\n8\u03c0\n\n(43)\n\nIn this expression we have omitted the energyindependent part and the contribution following from the\nprincipal-value part of the energy integral because, as we\nhave seen previously, these do not contribute to the final\nequation of motion for the direction of the spin. Following the same steps as in the previous section, we find\nthat the damping kernel in the general Langevin equation in Eq. (25) reduces to a Gilbert damping term with\na voltage-dependent damping parameter given by\n\u0003\n\u22062 \u0002 2\nA (\u03bc + |e|V ) + A2 (\u03bc)\n4\u03c0\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n|e|V\n.\n\u2243 \u03b10 1 + O\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b1 (V ) =\n\n(44)\n\nThis result is physically understood by noting that the\nGilbert damping is determined by the dissipative part of\nthe response function \u03a0(+) (\u01eb). In this simple model, this\ndissipative part gets contributions from processes that\ncorrespond to an electron leaving or entering the system,\nto or from the leads, respectively. The dissipative part\nis in general proportional to the density of states at the\nFermi energy. Since the Fermi energy of left and right\nlead is equal to \u03bc + |e|V and \u03bc, respectively, the Gilbert\ndamping has two respective contributions corresponding\nto the two terms in Eq. (44).\nNote that the result that the Gilbert damping parameter initially varies linearly with the voltage is in agreement with the results of Katsura et al.27 , although these\nauthors consider a slightly different model. In the inset of\nFig. 1 we show the Gilbert damping parameter as a function of voltage. The parameters taken are \u2206/J = 0.1,\nJC = J, \u03bc/J = 1 and \u03bc/(kB T ) = 100.\nAlthough we can no longer make use of the fluctuationdissipation theorem, we are nevertheless able to determine the fluctuations by calculating the low-energy behavior of the Keldysh component of the response function\nin the nonzero-voltage situation. It is given by\nZ\ni\nd\u01eb\u2032 2 \u2032\nK\n\u03a0 (\u01eb) = \u2212\nA (\u01eb ) {[N (\u03bcL \u2212\u01eb\u2032 )+N (\u03bcR \u2212\u01eb\u2032 )]\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n\u00d7 [N (\u01eb\u2032 \u2212\u03bcL )+N (\u01eb\u2032 \u2212\u03bcR )]} .\n(45)\nWe define an effective temperature by means of\nkB Teff (T, V ) \u2261\n\ni\u03a0K (\u01eb)\u22062\n.\n2\u03b1(V )\n\n(46)\n\nThis definition is motivated by the fact that, as we\nmention below, the spin direction obeys the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation with voltagedependent damping and fluctuations characterized by the\nabove effective temperature43 . From the expression for\n\u03b1(V ) and \u03a0K (\u01eb) we see that in the limit of zero bias\nvoltage we recover the equilibrium result Teff = T . In\nthe situation that |e|V is substantially larger than kB T ,\nwhich is usually approached in experiments, we have that\nkB Teff (T, V ) \u2243\n\nkB T\n|e|V\n+\n,\n4\n2\n\n(47)\n\n\f7\nwhich in the limit that |e|V \u226b kB T becomes independent of the actual temperature of the leads. In Fig. 1\nthe effective temperature as a function of bias voltage is\nshown, using the expression for \u03a0K (\u01eb) given in Eq. (45).\nThe parameters are the same as before, i.e., \u2206/J = 0.1,\nJC = J, \u03bc/J = 1 and \u03bc/(kB T ) = 100. Clearly the effective temperature changes from Teff = T at zero bias\nvoltage to the asymptotic expression in Eq. (47) shown by\nthe dashed line in Fig. 1. The crossover between actual\ntemperature and voltage as a measure for the fluctuations\nis reminiscent of the theory of shot noise in mesoscopic\nconductors44 . This is not surprising, since in the singlesite model we use the noise in the equation of motion ultimately arises because of fluctuations in the number of\nelectrons in the single-site system, and is therefore closely\nrelated to shot noise in the current through the system.\nForos et al.35 calculate the magnetization noise arising\nfrom spin current shot noise in the limit that |e|V \u226b kB T\nand |e|V \u226a kB T . In these limits our results are similar\nto theirs.\nWith the above definition of the effective temperature\nwe find that in the nonzero bias voltage situation the spin\ndirection obeys the stochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert\nequation, identical in form to the equilibrium case in\nEqs. (38) and (40), with the Gilbert damping parameter and temperature replaced according to\n\u03b10 \u2192 \u03b1(V ) ;\nT \u2192 Teff (T, V ) .\n\n(48)\n\nMoreover, the transport-steady-state probability distribution for the direction of the spinis a Boltzmann distribution with the effective temperature characterizing the\nfluctuations.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a microscopic derivation of the\nstochastic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equation for a semiclassical single spin under bias. We found that the\nGilbert damping parameter is voltage dependent and to\nlowest order acquires a correction linear in the bias voltage, in agreement with a previous study for a slightly\ndifferent model27 . In addition, we have calculated the\nstrength of the fluctuations directly without using the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem and found that, in the\nlow-frequency regime, the fluctuations are characterized\nby a voltage and temperature dependent effective temperature.\nTo arrive at these results we have performed a low\nfrequency expansion of the various correlation functions\nthat enter the theory. Such an approximation is valid as\nlong as the dynamics is much slower than the times set\nby the other energy scales in the system such as temperature and the Fermi energy. Moreover, in order for the\nleads to remain in equilibrium as the spin changes direction, the processes in the leads that lead to equilibration\n\nhave to be much faster than the precession period of the\nmagnetizationspin. Both these criteria are satisfied in\nexperiments with magnetic materials. In principle however, the full Langevin equation derived in Sec. II also describes dynamics beyond this low-frequency approximation. The introduction of the effective temperature relies\non the low-frequency approximation though, and for arbitrary frequencies such a temperature can no longer be\nuniquely defined28 .\nAn effective temperature for magnetization dynamics has been introduced before on phenomenological\ngrounds36,37,38 . Interestingly, the phenomenological expression of Urazhdin et al.36 , found by experimentally\nstudying thermal activation of current-driven magnetization reversal in magnetic trilayers, has the same form\nas our expression for the effective temperature in the\nlarge bias-voltage limit [Eq. (47)] that we derived microscopically. Zhang and Li37 , and Apalkov and Visscher38 ,\nhave, on phenomenological grounds, also introduced an\neffective temperature to study thermally-assisted spintransfer-torque-induced magnetization switching.\nIn\ntheir formulation, however, the effective temperature is\nproportional to the real temperature because the current\neffectively modifies the energy barrier for magnetization\nreversal.\nForos et al.35 consider spin current shot noise in the\nlarge bias-voltage limit and find for sufficiently large voltage that the magnetization noise is dominated by shot\nnoise. Moreover, they also consider the low bias-voltage\nlimit and predict a crossover for thermal to shot-noise\ndominated magnetization fluctuations. Our main result\nin Fig. 1 provides an explicit example of this crossover\nfor a simple model system obtained by methods that are\neasily generalized to more complicated models. In the\nexperiments of Krivorotov et al.45 the temperature dependence of the dwell time of parallel and anti-parallel\nstates of a current-driven spin valve was measured. At\nlow temperatures kB T . |e|V the dwell times are no\nlonger well-described by a constant temperature, which\ncould be a signature of the crossover from thermal noise\nto spin current shot noise. However, Krivorotov et al.\ninterpret this effect as due to ohmic heating, which is\nnot taken into account in the model presented in this\npaper, nor in the work by Foros et al.35 . Moreover, in\nrealistic materials phonons provide an additional heat\nbath for the magnetization, with an effective temperature that may depend in a completely different manner\non the bias voltage than the electron heat-bath effective temperature. Nonetheless, we believe that spin current shot noise may be observable in future experiments\nand that it may become important for applications as\ntechnological progress enables further miniaturization of\nmagnetic materials. Moreover, the formalism presented\nhere is an important step in understanding magnetization\nnoise from a microscopic viewpoint as its generalization\nto more complicated models is in principle straightforward. Possible interesting generalizations include making one of the leads ferromagnetic (see also Ref. [46]).\n\n\f8\nSince spin transfer torques will occur on the single spin\nas a spin-polarized current from the lead interacts with\nthe single-spin system, the resulting model would be a\ntoy model for microscopically studying the attenuation\nof spin transfer torques and current-driven magnetization reversal by shot noise. Another simple and useful generalization would be enlarging the system to include more than one spin. The formalism presented here\nwould allow for a straightforward microscopic calculation of Gilbert damping and adiabatic and nonadiabatic\nspin transfer torques which are currently attracting a lot\nof interest in the context of current-driven domain wall\nmotion6,7,8,9,10,11,12 .
