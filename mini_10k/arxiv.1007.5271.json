Introduction\nRecent interest in magneto inertial fusion[2, 5, 8] has resulted in the investigation of new schemes for magnetized target compression. The typical\nfoil liner approach suffers from the \"stand off\" problem where mechanical\nconnections to the device are destroyed with each shot. Many different solutions to the stand off problem have been described. One possible approach\nis the use of plasma jets for target compression[3, 2, 4, 6, 9]. In this scenario\nI\n\nThis research was supported in part by the Department of Energy SBIR Grant desc0000833. The fluids code uses the FACETS framework[1] and the authors would like to\nthank the FACETS framework team, J Cary, A Hakim, A Pletzer, S Shasharina, M Miah\n(Tech-X Corporation) and T Epperly (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory).\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nOctober 27, 2018\n\n\fthe target is moved into a chamber and a cylindrical array of plasma jets is\nfired simultaneously at the target. The jets merge to form a plasma liner that\ncompresses the target. A new experiment at Los Alamos National Lab, the\nPlasma Liner Experiment (PLX) is currently under construction to explore\nplasma jet merging. This work is part of an effort to understand jet merging\nphysics and develop numerical tools for modeling such a device. In particular\nthis is a first effort at investigating jet merging with radiation.\nThe current investigation uses ideal MHD for magnetized target simulations and the ideal Euler equations for simulations without magnetic fields.\nThe MHD model used is single species so both the target and the jet are made\nof argon, in an ideal experiment the target plasma would be hydrogenic so\na multi-species MHD model would be used for modeling. In the MHD case\na simple optically thin Bremsstrahlung radiation model assuming constant\nionization state is used. The effects of simple radiation model are so dramatic that it becomes clear that precise knowledge of plasma chemistry and\nradiation transport will be very important in future theoretical/numerical\ninvestigations. Ultimately a collisional radiative model combined with a radiation diffusion is likely needed to make accurate predictions.\nThe results presented show typical peak pressure and densities that could\nbe achieved in a high powered merging jet experiment in the ideal case. In an\nactual experiment with similar jet parameters where jets are merging in 3D,\npeak pressures are likely to be significantly higher. The results also illustrate\n\"radiative collapse\" which could occur in this type of device if the jets were to\nremain optically thin during liner formation and collapse. The loss of thermal\nenergy due to radiation in the jet during compression might mean that the\nram efficiency of the jet remains high during the target compression phase\nresulting in efficient coupling of jet directed energy to target compression.\n2. Model\nBoth gas dynamic (2) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) (3) models are\nused in this paper. The gas dynamic model is equivalent to the MHD model\nwhen the magnetic field is set to zero everywhere, however the gas dynamic\nmodel is used because it is faster computationally since there only 5 unknowns\ninstead of 8. The gas dynamic problem is used in situations where there is no\nmagnetic field. An ideal equation of state is assumed and a simple radiation\nmodel is used in several simulations.

This term is used to propagate\nerrors in the constraint equation \u2207 * B = 0 out of the domain at the error\npropagation speed \u0393. This technique was originally developed in [13]. The\nelectron number density ne is computed from these equations as ne = Zeff m\u03c1i\nwhere mi is the ion mass and the temperature is given by Te (kelvin) =\nP\n. The simulations performed in this paper are 2D meaning that\nkb n(Zeff +1)\nthe Z derivative is zero, however all terms including uz , Bx and By are kept\neven though their values remain zero throughout the simulation. Nautilus is\na 3D code, however, 2D simulations were performed so that peak pressure\nconvergence could be achieved. At low resolution the predicted peak pressure\nis dominated by numerical diffusion and is much lower than it should be. At\na resolution of 800X800 cells or higher the numerical diffusion no longer\ndominates the measured peak pressure and convergence is achieved. This\nalso suggests that in 3D, converged simulations would require 800X800X800\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\fcells and would take significantly longer to run.\n3. Numerical Approach\nSimulations were performed using Nautilus, a fluid plasma modeling code\ndeveloped at Tech-X. In order to obtain jet propagation through vacuum a\nspecialized approach was required. The approach taken is related to that\nused in [11, 12] and is described below.\nIn these simulations the equations are solved at every time step using\ntwo different approaches. The first approach is a positivity conserving first\norder finite volume method. This technique maintains positive pressure and\npositive density in the solution even when there are density or pressure jumps\nof 9-12 orders of magnitude. The scheme is locally conservative and shock\ncapturing, though only first order accurate. A first order positive solution\nthroughout the entire domain is computed using this technique. This solution\nin cell i is called qip and the solution has associated with it one flux across\neach face s denoted fsp . In this case s can be thought of as a global index of\ncell faces since each face is shared by two cells.\nTo compute a higher order accurate solution a second scheme is used.\nThe second scheme is a second order upwind MUSCL method which is also\nshock capturing and conservative, but not positivity conserving. The solution\nobtained using this approach in cell i is denoted qia and has associated with\nit one flux across each face s denoted fsa .\nSolving just using the first order accurate scheme results in solutions that\nare far too diffuse at the resolutions used in this paper and the jets expand\nmuch more rapidly than they should. As a result, it's necessary to use a\ncombination of the first and second order scheme.\nEvery face has associated with it one flux, the flux is added to one cell\nand subtracted from the other, this ensures conservation. The final solution\nis computed from a combination of fluxes from the positive solution and the\naccurate solution. The final flux fs chosen for face s becomes\n\u0014\nfs =\n\nfsa if PRa > P0 and \u03c1aR > \u03c10 and PLa > P0 and \u03c1aL > \u03c10\nfsp otherwise\n\n\u0015\n(4)\n\nwhere PRa , \u03c1aR , PLa and \u03c1aL are the pressure and densities determined by the\naccurate scheme to the left and the right of face s. P0 and \u03c10 are basement\ndensities and pressures that are typically set to 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22129 times the\n4\n\n\fpeak initial pressure and density in the simulation. This approach ensures\nthat the positive solution is used in cells where the pressure and density are\npredicted to be below the threshold.\nIt's important to note, that if one simply sets a basement pressure and\ndensity (as is frequently done in MHD), mass, momentum and energy conservation errors will occur that can drastically alter the results to these jet\nproblems introducing unphysical effects that destroy the solution. This is especially true when radiation losses are included. In our specific case, simply\nsetting the background pressure and density to basement values introduced\nperturbations in the solution which caused small shock waves in our high\nspeed jets and they lost symmetry before merging even occurred. This effect\nbecame exaggerated when the jets moved diagonal to the grid. Finally, if the\nbackground density and pressure were too high, say 1/1000 the jet density\nand pressure, the jets would create a large wake which would then interact\nwith neighboring jets resulting in the development of shocks in the jet even\nbefore jet merging.\n4. Setup\nParameter regimes for jet merging were explored by Cassibry[10] and by\nParks[6]. Based on those results we've chosen jets that are in the fusion\nreactor regime. The PLX device is a spherical device where the jets are\nplaced at a subset of the faces of a truncated icosahedron with up to 32 jets.\nIn these 2D simulations we've used 6, 12 and 24 jets to gain some idea of the\nrelationship between peak pressure and the number of jets in non-radiating\nsimulations. In these gas dynamic simulation no target is included. The\ninitial temperatures, jet diameters and pulse lengths are based on simulations\nsuggested by Cassibry[10] for the PLX experiment. In the simulations that\nfollow the following conditions are used. Jets are initialized to either Mach\n80 = 226 km/s or Mach 40 = 113 km/s. The 2D jet diameter is 8cm with\na jet length of 50cm. The initial total temperature is 2eV while the initial\nnumber density is assumed to be 5.0 \u00d7 1023 m13 . The plasma is an argon\nplasma and the bremsstrahlung radiation model assumes constant ionization\nstate Z=9. Densities in the vacuum are set to 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 times the initial\njet density and vacuum pressures are set to 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 times the initial jet\npressure. The results have been split into two sets, the first set of results are\ngas-dynamic simulations where we are simply looking at the peak pressure\nand density ignoring radiation effects. These simulations help us bound the\n5\n\n\fparameter regime for simulations with plasma chemistry. In the second set of\nsimulations we use one jet configuration and look at the effect of our simple\nradiation model with a magnetized target. In the radiating case we've only\nincluded one jet configuration as that is sufficient to illustrate the important\nphysical effect observed, namely the high peak density and magnetic field\ndue to radiation losses in the merging jets and the target. Modifying the\nnumber of jets in the radiating case did not change the observed phenomena.\n5. Results\nFigure 1 shows results of a neutral fluid simulation at Mach 80 on a\n1600 \u00d7 1600 grid. Four snapshots are shown. The first sub plot (upper left)\nshows the jets just as they begin to merge and the liner is formed. Shocks\ndevelop where the jets begin to merge and are indicated by bright lines in the\nplot. The second sub plot (upper right) shows the jets after they've collided\nin the middle and the resulting shock wave begins expanding outwards. The\nthird sub plot (lower left) shows additional shock expansion. Final sub plot\n(lower right) shows the development of Rayleigh Taylor instabilities. Figure\n2 shows the same simulation using MHD with a 0.1 Tesla magnetized target.\nThe first sub plot (upper left) shows the initial Bz field. The second plot\n(upper right) shows the field near peak compression. The next two plots show\nthe field again as it expands. Some Rayleigh Taylor instability is evident.\nFigure 3 and figure 4 show peak pressure, density and the total energy\nin the system for merging neutral jets at Mach 40 and 80 using 6, 12 and 24\njets. No radiation was included in these simulations. Peak pressure reaches\n140kbar and density reaches 3kg/m3 in the Mach 40 case and 800kbar and\n5.5kg/m3 in the Mach 80 case. Total energy of the system is also plotted.\nJets enter the domain through the boundary so total energy increases until the jets are turned off at which point the energy remains constant. As\nexpected, pressure and density peak and then rapidly decline. Peak pressure is increased as the number of jets is increased in agreement with work\nperformed by Cassibry [10].\nFigure 6 and 7 show plots of peak Bz density, pressure and total system\nenergy of Mach 40 and Mach 80 MHD jets with target a 0.1Tesla initial\nmagnetic field. The initial target configuration is not in equilibrium and\nwould expand if it were not for compression by the plasma jets. The field\ncan be though of as an idealized solenoidal field. Results are shown with\nand without using the optically thin radiation model. Note that in 6 and\n6\n\n\fFigure 1: Simple jet merging using inviscid Navier Stokes equations.

Peak pressure reaches\n800kbar in the 24 jet simulation.\n\n10\n\n\f7 the magnetic field and density have been plotted on a log plot. When\nradiation is included in the model the peak magnetic field reaches about\n100 times its value in the non-radiating case. What's more, peak field and\ndensity are maintained constant for several microseconds, corresponding to\nthe length of time the jets are turned on. The results suggest that plasma jets\nmight be able to be used used to obtain long lasting strong magnetic fields,\nfurthermore they provide an upper limit on what to expect when complete\nradiation models are included (including reabsorption).\nUsing the Rosseland mean free path for bremsstrahlung radiation\n7/2\n\n64.0A2 Te\nL\u2248\n3\n3\nZef\nf \u03c1\n\ncm\n\n(5)\n\n(defined in [7] for example) where A is the atomic mass number, Te is the\nelectron temperature in keV and \u03c1 is the mass density in cmg 3 , we can arrive\nat an estimate of the importance of absorption in different regimes. In these\nkg\nsimulations peak plasma densities of around 5000 m\n3 were achieved while the\nkg\ninitial jet was about .03 m3 . Figure 5 shows the Rosseland mean free path\n(in centimeters) for bremsstrahlung radiation as a function of density and\ntemperature. When the mean free path is below about 1cm reabsorption\nwill be significant. The plot suggests that reabsorption will be significant\nin the jet plasma during merging after it radiates a significant amount of\nenergy away bringing it to around 100eV in temperature. This plot assumes\na constant Zef f = 9. This also suggests that radiation from the magnetized\ntarget will be partially absorbed by the dense relatively cold liner.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 5: Plot of bremsstrahlung Rosseland mean free path vs temperature and density\nassuming constant Zef f = 9. In much of the plasma the optically thin model is accurate,\nhowever during liner formation the plasma will radiate significantly cooling it down at\nhigh density and decreasing the bremsstrahlung mean free path until a significant part of\nthe radiation is re-absorbed. A radiation diffusion approximation can be used to capture\nthis effect. This also indicates the importance of determining Zef f accurately, as a larger\nZef f will decrease the mean free path and a smaller Zef f will increase the mean free path\nby a significant amount.\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 6: Mach 40 MHD jet merging simulations with and without using optically thin\nbremsstrahlung radiation model. Log plots of the peak magnetic field show that the peak\nfield reaches about 100 times the value achieved in the non-radiating case.\n\n6. Conclusion\nFirst steps in modeling plasma jet merging have been performed in 2D\nusing ideal gas dynamic and ideal MHD equations with a simple optically\nthin radiation model assuming constant Zef f . Gas-dynamic modeling without radiation or targets showed that merging jet peak pressures on the order\nof 100s of kBar could be achieved for the conditions simulated, peak pressure\nincreasing with the number of jets. Results indicate late time Rayleigh Taylor instabilities in all cases and the heavy influence of radiation in the MHD\nsimulations. Including radiation results in field enhancement 100 times that\nobserved in simulations without radiation and resulting peak field compression of several microseconds, substantially different than the non-radiating\n13\n\n\fFigure 7: Mach 80 MHD jet merging simulations with and without using optically thin\nbremsstrahlung radiation model. The field compresses to about 100 times the nonradiating case, similar to what occurs for the Mach 40 jets.\n\n14\n\n\fcase. The radiation simulations illustrate the importance of properly capturing the argon plasma ionization state in addition to the importance of\nmodeling the radiation properly. The optically thin model becomes invalid\nas the liner density rises and we would ultimately expect lower peak field\ncompression as a result. The radiation in the jet effectively increases the jet\nMach number, therefore increasing the ram efficiency of the jet. In these\nsimulations, both jet and target were argon plasmas. In a real device, the\ntarget plasma would be deuterium, while the jets argon or some other high Z\ngas resulting in large radiation losses in the jet and lower radiation losses in\nthe target. An accurate study will require complete atomic physics requiring\nmulti-species MHD and radiation in both the optically thin and diffusion\nlimit. These efforts will be part of future investigations.\nReferences\n[1] John R.
