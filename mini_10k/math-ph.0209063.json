When this is the case, the equations of motion are (in principal,\nat least) separable and solutions can be obtained by the method of quadratures.\nWhen we study some mechanical or field theory problem, we imply that time and space\ncoordinates are real, whereas the integrability of motion equations is connected with the\nbehavior of their solutions as functions of complex time and (in the case of the field theory)\ncomplex spatial coordinates.\nS.V. Kovalevskaya was the first, who proposed [1] to consider time as a complex variable\nand to demand that solutions of the motion equations have to be single-valued, meromorphic\nfunctions on the whole complex (time) plane. This idea gave a remarkable result: S.V. Kovalevskaya discovered a new integrable case (nowadays known as the Kovalevskaya's case)\nfor the motion of a heavy rigid body about a fixed point [1] (see also [2, 3]). The work of\nS.V. Kovalevskaya has shown the importance of application of the analytical theory of differential equations to physical problems. The essential stage of development of this theory was\na classification of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in order of types of singularities of\ntheir solutions. This classification has been made by P. Painlev\u00e9.\nLet us formulate the Painlev\u00e9 property for ODE's. Solutions of a system of ODE's\nare regarded as analytic functions, may be with isolated singular points [4, 5]. A singular\npoint of a solution is said critical (as opposed to noncritical) if the solution is multivalued\n(single-valued) in its neighborhood and movable if its location depends on initial conditions1 .\n\nDefinition. A system of ODE's has the Painlev\u00e9 property if its general solution\nhas no movable critical singular point [6, 7].\nAn arbitrary solution of such system is single-valued in the neighborhood of its singular\npoint t0 and can be expressed as a Laurent series with a finite number of terms with negative\npowers of t\u2212t0 . If a system has not the Painlev\u00e9 property, but, after some change of variables,\nthe obtained system possesses this property, then the initial system is said to have the weak\nPainlev\u00e9 property.\nInvestigations of many dynamical systems, Hamiltonian [8\u201310] or dissipative (for example,\nthe Lorenz systems [10\u201313]), show, that a system is completely integrable only for such\nvalues of parameters, at which it has the Painlev\u00e9 property (or the weak Painlev\u00e9 property).\nArguments, which clarify the connection between the Painlev\u00e9 analysis and the existence of\nmotion integrals, are presented in [14, 15]. If the system misses the Painlev\u00e9 property (has\ncomplex or irrational \"resonances\"), then the system cannot be \"algebraically integrable\" [16]\n(see also [17] and references therein). At the same time the integrability of an arbitrary\nsystem with the Painlev\u00e9 property has yet to be proved. There is not an algorithm for\nconstruction of the additional integral by the Painlev\u00e9 analysis. It is easy to give an example\n1\n\nSolutions of a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian can have only movable singularities.\n\n2\n\n\fof an integrable system without the Painlev\u00e9 property [18]: H = 21 p2 + f (x), where f (x) is a\npolynomial which power is not lower than five. The given system is trivially integrable, but\nits general solution is not a meromorphic function.\nThe Painlev\u00e9 test is any algorithm designed to determine necessary conditions for a\ndifferential equation to have the Painlev\u00e9 property. The original algorithm, developed by\nP. Painlev\u00e9 and used by him to find all the second order ODE's with Painlev\u00e9 property [7],\nis known as the \u03b1-method. The method of S.V. Kovalevskaya is not as general as the\n\u03b1\u2013method, but much more simple2 .\nIn 1980, motivated by the work of S.V. Kovalevskaya [1], M.J. Ablowitz, A. Ramani and\nH. Segur [20] developed a new algorithm of the Painlev\u00e9 test for ODE's. The remarkable\nproperty of this test is that it can be checked in a finite number of steps. They also were\nthe first to point out the connection between the nonlinear partial differential equations\n(PDE's), which are soluble by the inverse scattering transform method, and ODE's with\nthe Painlev\u00e9 property. Subsequently the Painlev\u00e9 property for PDE was defined and the\ncorresponding Painlev\u00e9 test (the WTC procedure) was constructed [21, 22] (see also [19,\n23\u201329]). With the help of this test it has been found, that all PDE's, which are solvable\nby the inverse scattering transforms, have the Painlev\u00e9 property, may be, after some change\nof variables. For many integrable PDE's, for example, the Korteweg\u2013de-Vries [10] and the\nsine\u2013Gordon [23] equations, the B\u00e4cklund transformations and the Lax representations result\nfrom the WTC procedure [22, 24, 29]. Also, special solutions for certain nonintegrable PDE's\nwere constructed using this algorithm [30, 31].\nThe algorithm for finding special solutions for ODE system in the form of a finite expansion in powers of unknown function \u03c6(t \u2212 t0 ) has been constructed in [32, 33]. The\nfunction \u03c6(t \u2212 t0 ) and coefficients have to satisfy some system of ODE, often more simple\nthan an initial one. This method has been used [34] to construct exact solutions for certain\nnonintegrable systems of ODE's.\nThe aim of this paper is to find new special solutions for the generalized H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles\nsystem using the Painlev\u00e9 test. In distinction to [34] we obtain solutions as formal Laurent\nor Puiseux series and find domains of their convergence.\n\n2\n\nTHE H\u00c9NON\u2013HEILES HAMILTONIAN\n\nLet us consider the motion of a star in an axial-symmetric and time-independent potential.\nThe motion equations admit two well-known integrals (energy and angular momentum) and\nwould be solved by the method of quadratures if the third integral of motion is known. Due\nto the symmetry of the potential the considered system is equivalent to two-dimensional one.\nHowever, for many polynomial potentials the obtained system has not the second integral\nas a polynomial function.\nIn the 1960s, asymptotic methods [35, 36] have been developed to show either existence\nor absence of the third integral for some polynomial potentials. To answer the question\nabout the existence of the third integral H\u00e9non and Heiles [37] considered the behavior\nof numerically integrated trajectories. Emphasizing that their choice of potential does not\nproceed from experimental data, H\u00e9non and Heiles have proposed the following Hamiltonian:\n2\n\nDifferent variants of the Painlev\u00e9 test are compared in [19, R. Conte paper]\n\n3\n\n\f\u0011\n1\n1\u0010 2\nxt + yt2 + x2 + y 2 + x2 y \u2212 y 3,\n(1)\n2\n3\nbecause: on the one hand, it is analytically simple; this makes the numerical computations\nof trajectories easy; on the other hand, it is sufficiently complicated to give trajectories\nwhich are far from trivial. Indeed, for low energies the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system appears to be\nintegrable, in so much as trajectories (numerically integrated) always lay on well-defined twodimensional surfaces. On the other hand, for high energies many of these integral surfaces\nare destroyed, it points on absence of the third integral.\nSubsequent numerical investigations [38, 39] show, that in the complex t-plane singular\npoints of solutions of the motion equations group in self-similar spirals. It turns out extremely\ncomplicated distributions of singularities, forming a boundary, across which the solutions can\nnot be analytically continued.\nThe generalized H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system is described by the Hamiltonian:\nH=\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010 2\nC\nxt + yt2 + \u03bbx2 + y 2 + x2 y \u2212 y 3\n2\n3\nand the corresponding system of the motion equations:\n(\nxtt = \u2212\u03bbx \u2212 2xy,\nH=\n\nytt = \u2212y \u2212 x2 + Cy 2 ,\n\n2\n\n(1\u2032 )\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\nwhere xtt \u2261 ddt2x and ytt \u2261 ddt2y , \u03bb and C are numerical parameters.\nDue to the Painlev\u00e9 analysis the following integrable cases of (2) have been found:\n(i) C = \u22121,\n(ii) C = \u22126,\n(iii) C = \u221216,\n\n\u03bb = 1,\n\u03bb is an arbitrary number,\n1\n\u03bb = 16\n.\n\nIn contradiction to the case (i) the cases (ii) and (iii) are nontrivial, so the integrability\nof these cases had to be proved additionally. In the 1980's the required second integrals\nwere constructed [40\u201343]. For integrable cases of the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system the B\u00e4cklund\ntransformations [32, 33] and the Lax representations [25, 26, 45] have been found.\nThe three integrable cases of the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system correspond precisely to the stationary flows of the only three integrable cases of fifth-order polynomial nonlinear evolution\nequations of scale weight 7 (respectively the Sawada\u2013Kotega, the fifth-order Korteweg\u2013de\nVries and the Kaup\u2013Kupershmidt equations) [33, 44, 45].\nThe H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system is a model widely used in physics, in particular, in gravitation [46\u201348] and plasma theory [49]. The models, described by the Hamiltonian (1\u2032 ) with\nsome additional nonpolynomial terms, are actively studied [45, 50\u201352] as well.\n\n3\n\nNONINTEGRABLE CASES\n\nThe general solutions of the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system are known only in integrable cases [52], in\nother cases search of new (exact or asymptotic) solutions is an actual problem.\n4\n\n\fThe procedure for transformation the Hamiltonian to a normal form and for construction\nthe second independent integral in the form of formal power series in the phase variables\nx, xt , y and yt (Gustavson integral) has been realized for the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system both in\nthe original (\u03bb = 1, C = 1) [36] (see also [53]) and in the general forms [54, 55]. Using the\nBruno algorithm [56, 57] V.F. Edneral has constructed the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Dulac normal form\nand found [58, 59] (provided that all phase variables are small) local families of periodic\nsolutions. Recently it has been found that a local series around the singularities in the\ncomplex (time) plane can be transformed to some local series around the singularities at the\nfixed points in phase space and analyzed via normal forms theory [60, 61].\nThe H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system as a system of two second order ODE's is equivalent to the\nfourth order equation3 :\nytttt = (2C \u2212 8)ytt y \u2212 (4\u03bb + 1)ytt + 2(C + 1)yt2 + f rac20C3y 3 + (4C\u03bb \u2212 6)y 2 \u2212 \u03bby \u2212 4H, (3)\nwhere H is the energy of the system.\nTo find a special solution of the given equation one can assume that y satisfies some more\nsimple equation.

We assume that real parts of \u03b1 and \u03b2 are less\nthen zero, and, of course, a\u03b1 6= 0 and b\u03b2 6= 0.\nIf \u03b1 and \u03b2 are integer numbers, then substituting\nx = a\u03b1 (t \u2212 t0 )\u03b1 +\n\nN\nmax\nX\nj=1\n\n6\n\naj+\u03b1 (t \u2212 t0 )j+\u03b1,\n\n(10.1)\n\n\fy = b\u03b2 (t \u2212 t0 )\u03b2 +\n\nN\nmax\nX\nj=1\n\nbj+\u03b2 (t \u2212 t0 )j+\u03b2\n\n(10.2)\n\none can transform the ODE system into a set of linear algebraic systems in coefficients ak\nand bk . In the general case one can obtain the exact solutions (in the form of formal Laurent\nseries) only if one solves infinity number of systems (Nmax = \u221e). On the other hand, if one\nsolves a finite number of systems one obtains asymptotic solutions. With the help of some\ncomputer algebra system, for example, the system REDUCE [65, 66], these systems can be\nsolved step by step and asymptotic solutions can be automatically found with any accuracy.\nBut previously one has to determine values of constants \u03b1, \u03b2, a\u03b1 and b\u03b2 and to analyze\nsystems with zero determinants. Such systems correspond to new arbitrary constants or\nhave no solutions. Powers at which new arbitrary constants enter are called resonances. The\nPainlev\u00e9 test gives all information about possible dominant behaviors and resonances (see,\nfor example, [10]). Moreover, the results of the Painlev\u00e9 analysis point out cases, in which\nit is useful to include into expansion terms with fractional powers of t \u2212 t0 .\nFor the generalized H\u00e9non-Heiles system there exist two possible dominant behaviors and\nresonance structures [10, 39]:\nCase 1:\n\u03b1 = \u22122,\n\u03b2 = \u22122,\n\u221a\na\u03b1 = \u00b13 2 + C,\nb\u03b2 = \u22123,\n\u221a\n1\u221224(1+C)\n5\n.\nr = \u22121, 6, 2 \u00b1\n2\n\nCase 2: (\u03b2 < Re(\u03b1) < 0)\n\u221a\n1\u00b1 1\u221248/C\n\u03b1=\n,\n2\n\u03b2 = \u22122,\na\u03b1 = c1 (an arbitrary number),\nb\u03b2 = C6 ,\np\nr = \u22121, 0, 6, \u2213 1 \u2212 48/C.\n\nIn the Table the values of r denote resonances: r = \u22121 corresponds to arbitrary parameter\nt0 ; r = 0 (in the Case 2) corresponds to arbitrary parameter c1 . Other values of r determine\npowers of t, to be exact, t\u03b1+r for x and t\u03b2+r for y, at which new arbitrary parameters enter\n(as solutions of systems with zero determinants).\nFor integrability of system (2) all values of \u03b1 and r have to be integer (or rational) and\nall systems with zero determinants have to have solutions at all values of included in them\nfree parameters. It is possible only in the cases (i) - (iii).\nAt C = \u22122 (in the Case 1) a\u03b1 = 0. It is the consequence of the fact that, contrary to\nour assumption, the behaviour of the solution in the neighborhood of a singular point is not\nalgebraic, because its dominant term includes logarithm.\nThose values of C, at which \u03b1 and r are integer (or rational) numbers either only in the\nCase 1 or only in the Case 2, are of interest for search of special solutions.\n\n7\n\n\f5\n5.1\n\nNEW SOLUTIONS\nFinding of solutions in the form of formal Laurent series\n\n. In the Case 1 some values of r\nLet us consider the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system with C = \u2212 16\n5\nare not rational, so it is a nonintegrable system. To find special asymptotic solutions let us\nconsider the Case 2. In this case \u03b1 = \u2212 23 and r = \u22121, 0, 4, 6, hence, in the neighborhood\nof the singular point t0 we have to seek x in such form that x2 can be expand into Laurent\nseries, beginning from (t \u2212 t0 )\u22123 .

It is known\nthat a domain of Laurent series convergence is a ring. Let us find conditions, at which the\nobtained series converge in the following ring: 0 < |t| 6 1\u2212\u03b5, where \u03b5 is any positive number.\n\u221e\nX\n1\nis finite if |t| 6 1 \u2212 \u03b5, hence, our\ntn =\nThe sum of a geometrical progression S =\n1\u2212t\nn=0\nseries converge in the above-mentioned ring, if \u2203N such that \u2200n > N |an | 6 1 and |bn | 6 1.\nLet |an | 6 1 and |bn | 6 1 for all \u22121 6 n < k, then from (11), we obtain:\n|ak | 6\n\n2k + 2 + |\u03bb| + 2|c1 |\n,\n|k 2 \u2212 4|\n\n|bk | 6\n\n21(k + 2)\n.\n5(k 2 \u2212 k \u2212 12)\n\n(14)\n\nIt is easy to see that there exists such N, that, if |an | 6 1 and |bn | 6 1 for\np \u22121 6 n 6 N,\nthen |an | 6 1 and |bn | 6 1 for \u22121 6 n < \u221e. N is a maximum from 8 and 1+ |\u03bb| + 2|c1 | + 7.\nFor example, if \u03bb = 91 , then for any possible value of c1 , we obtain N = 8. It is easy to\nverify that if |a2 | 6 1 and |b4 | 6 1, then |an | 6 1 and |bn | 6 1 for \u22121 6 n 6 8, and, hence,\nfor an arbitrary n. Thus our Laurent series converge in the ring 0 < |t| 6 1 \u2212 \u03b5. Numerical\nanalysis shows [67] that these series can also converge at absolute values of parameters more\nthan unit. For other values of \u03bb the convergence can be considered analogously.\n\n10\n\n\f6\n\nGENERALIZATION OF SOLUTIONS IN TERMS\nOF THE WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS\n\nLet us consider solutions (4). The values of parameters (4a) correspond to x(t) \u2261 0. Solutions (4b) correspond to the Case 1 (see Table) and x(t) can be expressed in terms of the\nWeierstrass elliptic functions. For some values of C these two-parameter solutions can be\ngeneralized. For example, if C = \u2212 98 , then some resonances are half-integer.

For some values of two parameters the\nobtained solutions coincide with the known exact solutions. At C = \u2212 89 two-parameter solutions in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic functions have been generalized to three-parameter\nones. New solutions found as formal Puiseux series. For some values of \u03bb the analysis of\nconvergence of the obtained series has been made and it has been proved, that they have\nnonzero domain of convergence. Similar analysis can been made for any value of \u03bb.\nWith the help of the Painlev\u00e9 test particular asymptotic solutions as Laurent or Puiseux\nseries can be found for the H\u00e9non\u2013Heiles system with some other values of C and \u03bb. Just\nat these values of parameters the probability of finding of new exact solutions similar to the\nsolutions found in [64] is great.\nThe author is grateful to R. I. Bogdanov and V. F.
