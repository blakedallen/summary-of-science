Let L/K be a Galois extension of number fields. The problem of counting the\nnumber of prime ideals p of K with fixed Frobenius class in Gal(L/K) and norm satisfying\na congruence condition is considered. We show that the square of the error term arising\nfrom the Chebotar\u00ebv Density Theorem for this problem is small \"on average.\" The result\nmay be viewed as a variation on the classical Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem [1, 2, 3] concerns the average square error\nfor the Prime Number Theorem for primes in arithmetic progressions. In particular, if we\nlet\nX\n\u03b8(x; q, a) :=\nlog p,\np\u2261a\n\np\u2264x\n(mod q)\n\nthen the Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem states that, for every fixed M > 0,\n\u0012\n\u00132\nq\nX X\nx\n\u03b8(x; q, a) \u2212\n\u226a xQ log x,\n\u03c6(q)\nq\u2264Q a=1\n(a,q)=1\n\nprovided that x(log x)\u2212M \u2264 Q \u2264 x. See [4, p. 169] for a statement of this theorem with\n\u03b8(x; q, a) replaced by the Chebychev function \u03c8(x; q, a).\nIf one adopts the point of view that the Prime Number Theorem for primes in arithmetic\nprogressions is a specialization of the Chebotar\u00ebv Density Theorem [9, p. 143] for the cyclotomic extensions Q(\u03b6q )/Q, then, in light of the Kronecker-Weber Theorem [11, p. 210],\nthe Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem may be interpreted as giving a bound for the\naverage square error for the Chebotar\u00ebv Density Theorem taken over all Abelian extensions\nof Q. It would be natural then to study averages that include non-Abelian extensions as\nwell. In this paper, we consider averages where the Galois group varies over groups of the\nform G1 \u00d7 G2 , where G1 is a fixed (potentially non-Abelian) group and G2 \u2286 (Z/qZ)\u2217 with\nq varying.\nThis work is carried out for the purpose of providing a tool to study the \"average LangTrotter\" problem in number fields. Much is owed to the related paper of Murty and\nMurty [15].\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 11R44, 11N05, 11N36.\nKey words and phrases.

Statement of results\nLet L/K be a Galois extension of number fields with group G, and let C be a fixed\nconjugacy class in G. For any pair of integers q and a, we define\nX\n\u03b8(x; C, q, a) :=\nlog Np,\nNp\u2264x\n\n=C\n( L/K\np )\n\nNp\u2261a\n\n(mod q)\n\nwhere the sum is taken\u0010over\u0011all finite primes p of K that do not ramify in L, N = NK/Q\ndenotes the norm, and L/K\ndenotes the Frobenius class of p in G.\np\nFor each positive integer q, let \u03b6q denote a primitive q-th root of unity. If L \u2229 K(\u03b6q ) = K,\nthen\nGq := Gal(L(\u03b6q )/K) \u223c\n= Gal(K(\u03b6q )/K) \u00d7 G.\nSee [12, p. 267]. As in [20], there is a natural composition of maps\nGal(K(\u03b6q )/K) \u001f\n\u007f\n//\n\nGal(Q(\u03b6q )/Q)\n\n\u223c\n\n//\n\n(Z/qZ)\u2217 .\n\n(1)\n\nLetting GK,q denote the image of this map and \u03c6K (q) := |GK,q |, the Chebotar\u00ebv Density\nTheorem gives the asymptotic identity\n\u03b8(x; C, q, a) \u223c\n\n1 |C|\nx\n\u03c6K (q) |G|\n\n(2)\n\nas x \u2192 \u221e, provided that a \u2208 GK,q and L \u2229 K(\u03b6q ) = K. We remark that the Frobenius class\nof p in Gal(K(\u03b6q )/K) is determined by the residue of Np modulo q.\nIn this paper, we establish a variant of the classical Barban-Davenport-Halberstam Theorem similar to the variant of the classical Bombieri-Vinogradov Theorem proved by Murty\nand Murty in [15]. That is, we show an upper bound for the average square error in the\nasymptotic (2) when averaging over the set of all q such that L \u2229 K(\u03b6q ) = K and over all\na \u2208 GK,q . More precisely, we prove the following result.\nTheorem 1. Let M > 0. If x(log x)\u2212M \u2264 Q \u2264 x, then\n\u00132\nX\u2032 X \u0012\n1 |C|\n\u03b8(x; C, q, a) \u2212\nx \u226a xQ log x,\n\u03c6K (q) |G|\nq\u2264Q a\u2208G\n\n(3)\n\nK,q\n\nwhere the prime on the outer summation indicates that the sum is to be restricted to those\nq \u2264 Q satisfying L \u2229 K(\u03b6q ) = K. The constant implied by the symbol \u226a depends on L and\nM.\nRemark. By the triangle inequality, Theorem 1 holds in the case that C is a union of conjugacy classes in G = Gal(L/K) as well.\nRemark. The main result of [15] is precisely the Bombieri-Vinogradov type analogue of\nTheorem 1 in the case K = Q. M. R. Murty and K. Petersen have recently extended the\nmain result of [15] to the setting of number fields. However, their average on q is restricted to\nq satisfying L \u2229 Q(\u03b6q ) = Q. The author is grateful for receiving a copy of their preprint [17].\n2\n\n\fAs mentioned in the introduction, this work is carried out for the purpose of providing a\ntool to study the average Lang-Trotter problem in number fields. In particular, it useful for\nextending the works [5, 7] to the \"totally non-Abelian\" setting. As another application, we\ngive the following.\nTheorem 2. Suppose that K = Q and that L/Q is a totally non-Abelian Galois extension\n(i.e., L \u2229 Q(\u03b6q ) = Q for all q \u2265 1). There exist constants c, c\u2032 so that, for each fixed M > 0,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\nX X\n|C|\nx2\n|C| 2\n2\n\u03b8(x; C, q, a) \u2212\nx =\nx log x + cx + O\n;\n(4)\nM\n\u03c6(q)|G|\n|G|\n(log\nx)\na=1\nq\u2264x\n(a,q)=1\n\nand if 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 x,\n\u0012\nq\nX X\n\u03b8(x; C, q, a) \u2212\nq\u2264Q\n\na=1\n(a,q)=1\n\n\u00132\n|C|\n|C|2\n|C|\nx =\nxQ log x \u2212\nxQ log(x/Q) + c\u2032 xQ\n2\n\u03c6(q)|G|\n|G|\n|G|\n\u0010\n\n5\n\n\u0011\n3\n\n+ O Q4 x4 + O\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\nx\n(log x)M\n\n\u0013\n\n(5)\n\n.\n\nRemark. See [21] for a version of this result when K = L and K is not necessarily equal to\nQ.\nWe omit the proof of Theorem 2 since it follows from Theorem 1 by adapting the techniques\nof Hooley [8, pp. 209-212] in the obvious manner. It would be natural to try to remove the\nrestrictions on K and L from the statement of Theorem 2. However, if K 6= Q, then one\nseems to be left with the task of counting the number of prime ideals of a given norm and\nfixed Frobenius class. In the case, that L is not linearly disjoint from every cyclotomic\nextension, Theorem 1 requires that we remove the \"offending moduli\" from the outer sum\nover q. The result is that Hooley's trick (see [8, p. 210]) of \"switching divisors\" does not\nseem to work anymore.\nThe remainder of the article is outlined as follows. In Section 3, we recall some useful\nfacts about characters and L-functions. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Siegel-Walfisz\ntype results. The final section is concerned with the proof of Theorem 1.\n3. Class functions, characters, and Artin L-functions\nIn this section, we set up some general notation and recall some of the necessary background information concerning Galois representations and Artin L-functions. For a number\nfield F , we will write dF for the discriminant of F . If L/F is an extension of number fields,\nwe will write nL/F := [L : F ] for the degree of the extension. In the case that the base field\nis Q, we will simply write nL := [L : Q].\nSuppose that L/F is a Galois extension of number fields, say with group G. Consider a\ngroup representation \u03c1 : G \u2192 GLn (C). The character associated to \u03c1 is the function \u03b7 = \u03b7\u03c1\ndefined by \u03b7(\u03c3) := Tr(\u03c1(\u03c3)). For each finite prime p of F unramified in L, choose a prime\nP|p in L, and let \u03c3P denote the Frobenius at P. Further, put\n\u0001\u22121\nLp (s, \u03b7) := det I \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c3P )Np\u2212s\n,\n(6)\nand note that this definition does not depend on the choice of P|p. For the ramified primes,\nthere is a similar but slightly more complicated definition for Lp (s, \u03b7), and we refer the reader\n3\n\n\fto [14, pp. 8-9] or [16, p. 27] for the details. For Re(s) > 1, the Artin L-series associated to\n\u03c1 or \u03b7 is defined by the Euler product\nY\nL(s, \u03b7) :=\nLp (s, \u03b7),\n(7)\np\n\nwhere the product is over all the prime ideals p of F (including the ramified primes).\nAssociated to this L-series is an ideal of F called the Artin conductor. We denote this\nideal by f(\u03b7, L/F ). It is defined in terms of higher ramification groups, and we refer the\nreader to [14, pp. 13-14] or [16, p. 28] for more detail. The conductor of the L-series is then\ndefined by\nA(\u03b7) := |dF |\u03b7(1) NF/Q (f(\u03b7, L/F )).\n\nA function \u03be : G \u2192 C satisfying \u03be(g \u22121\u03c3g) = \u03be(\u03c3) for all g \u2208 G is said to be a class function\non G. Note that the character of a group representation is a class function. Given any class\nfunction \u03be on G, we define the weighted prime counting function\nX\n\u03b8(x; L/F, \u03be) :=\n\u03be(\u03c3p ) log Np,\nNp\u2264x\n\nwhere the sum is over the prime ideals of F that do not ramify in L, and \u03c3p denotes any\nelement of the Frobenius class at p. We also define the function\nX\n\u03c8(x; L/F, \u03be) :=\n\u03be(\u03c3pm ) log Np,\nNpm \u2264x\n\nwhere now we include all powers of prime ideals of F that do not ramify in L. For a prime p\nof F ramified in L and P a prime of L lying above p, let DP and IP denote the decomposition\nand inertia group at P respectively. We extend the definition of \u03be to ramfied p by\n1 X\n\u03be(\u03c3pm ) :=\n\u03be(g),\n|IP | g\nm\nwhere the sum is over all g \u2208 DP such that g \u2261 \u03c3P\n(mod IP ). We now define\nX\ne L/F, \u03be) :=\n\u03c8(x;\n\u03be(\u03c3pm ) log Np,\nNpm \u2264x\n\nwhere the sum is over all powers of prime ideals pm of F including the ramified ones. We\nwill sometimes suppress the field extension in the notation for these functions when there is\nno danger of confusion.\ne The difference between these\nIt will sometimes be necessary to switch between \u03b8 and \u03c8.\nfunctions is\nX\nX\ne \u03be) =\n\u03be(\u03c3p ) log Np.\n\u03be(\u03c3pm ) log Np +\n\u03b8(x; \u03be) \u2212 \u03c8(x;\nNpm \u2264x,\nm\u22652\n\nNp\u2264x\np ram.\n\nThe first sum on the right is\n\u221a over all prime ideals p of F and all integers m \u2265 2, and is\ntrivially bounded by ||\u03be||nF x log x, where ||\u03be|| := maxg\u2208G \u03be(g). The second sum on the\nright is over only those prime ideals p of F which ramify in L.

Siegel-Walfisz type estimates\nIn this section we assume that L/E is an Abelian extension of number fields. It follows that\nL(\u03b6q )/E is also an Abelian extension. In fact, Gal(L(\u03b6q )/E) \u0592\u2192 Gal(L/E)\u00d7(Z/qZ)\u2217 . See [12,\np. 267] for example. By the discussion in the last paragraph of Section 3, any irreducible\ncharacter \u03b7 of Gal(L(\u03b6q )/E) arises as \u03b7 = \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7, where \u03c9 is an irreducible character of\nGal(L/E) and \u03c7 is a Dirichlet character modulo q. By (9), we have the following conductor\nrelation\nA(\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7, L(\u03b6q )/E) \u2264 |dE |NE/Q (f(\u03c9, L/E))NE/Q(f(\u03c7, E(\u03b6q )/E))\n(10)\n\u2264 A(\u03c9, L/E)q nE .\nThe first objective of this section is to prove the following proposition, which is a generalization of Lemma 6.2 of [15, p. 267].\n\nProposition 1. Let L/E be an Abelian extension of number fields, \u03c9 an irreducible character\nof Gal(L/E), and let 1 < q, N be any integers so that A(\u03c9)q nE \u2264 (log x)N . Then there exists\na positive constant c0 (E, N) so that, for any Dirichlet character \u03c7 modulo q such that \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7\nis not trivial,\nn\no\np\ne\n\u03c8(x; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7) \u226a (log A(\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7))x exp \u2212c0 (E, N) log x .\nThe proof of this proposition relies heavily on the following, the content of which is drawn\nfrom Propositions 3.4 and 3.8 of [15, pp. 255, 258].\n\nLemma 1. Let F/E be an Abelian extension of number fields, let \u03b7 be a character of\nGal(F/E), and let L(t) := 21 log A(\u03b7) + nE log(|t| + 2). There is an absolute positive constant\nc1 such that L(s, \u03b7) has at most one zero \u03c3 + it in the region\nc1\n1\u2212\n\u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1.\nL(t)\nIf such a zero exists, then it is real and simple, and \u03b7 must be a character of order dividing\n2. Furthermore, we refer to such a zero as an exceptional zero of L(s, \u03b7) and denote it by\n\u03b2\u03b7 .\nLet \u01eb > 0, and let \u1ebc denote the normal closure of E over Q. If \u03b7 is a character of\nGal(F/E) for which \u03b2\u03b7 exists, then there is a positive constant c2 (\u01eb) so that\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nc2 (\u01eb)\n.\n,1\u2212\n\u03b2\u03b7 \u2264 max 1 \u2212\n(|d\u1ebc |2 A(\u03b7))\u01eb\n16n\u1ebc log(|d\u1ebc |2 A(\u03b7))\nRemark. We observe that if \u03b7 is a character for which \u03b2\u03b7 exists and \u03b2\u03b7 < 1/2, then the\nfunctional equation for L(s, \u03b7) implies that 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b7 is also a zero since \u03b7 = \u03b7. In this case, we\nwould have\n1\nc1\n\u2264 \u03b2\u03b7 < < 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b7 ,\n1\u2212\nL(0)\n2\n6\n\n\fwhich contradicts Lemma 1. Thus, we may assume that if \u03b2\u03b7 exists, then\n1\nc1\n\u22641\u2212\n\u2264 \u03b2\u03b7 .\n2\nL(0)\n\nRemark. Applying Lemma 1 to the character \u03b7 and appealing to the functional equation for\nL(s, \u03b7), we see that L(s, \u03b7) has at most one zero \u03c3 + it in the region\nc1\n.\n0\u2264\u03c3\u2264\nL(t)\n\nFurthermore, if such a zero exists, it must be simple, \u03b7 = \u03b7 must be a character of order\ndividing 2, and we deduce that this zero equal to 1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b7 .\n\nRemark. The second part of Lemma 1 depends on Siegel's Theorem [4, p. 126], and as such\nis ineffective. This, of course, means that Proposition 1 is ineffective as well.\nProof of Proposition 1. The proof follows the traditional method as in [10]. For convenience,\nwe write \u03b7 = \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7. We begin with integral identity\nZ\n1\nL\u2032 (s, \u03b7) xs\ne\n\u03c8(x; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7) = \u2212\nds.\n2\u03c0i (2) L(s, \u03b7) s\n\nWith \u03c30 = 1 + (log x)\u22121 and T a real parameter, we estimate the right-hand side by the\ntruncated integral\nZ \u03c30 +iT \u2032\n1\nL (s, \u03b7) xs\nI\u03b7 (x, T ) := \u2212\nds.\n2\u03c0i \u03c30 \u2212iT L(s, \u03b7) s\nWe note that our definition of I\u03b7 (x, T ) differs from that in [10, p. 440] by a negative sign.\nArguing as in [10, pp. 424-428], for x \u2265 2 and T > 0, we have\n\n2\ne L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7) \u2212 I\u03b7 (x, T ) \u226a nE log x + nE x(log x) ,\n(11)\n\u03c8(x;\nT\nwhere the implied constant is absolute. Since \u03c7 is assumed to be nontrivial, it follows that\n\u03b7 = \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7 is as well. Now, provided that x, T \u2265 2 and that T does not coincide with the\nimaginary part of any zero of L(s; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7), in [10, p.450], we find that\nX x\u03c1\nX 1\nx log x\nI\u03b7 (x, T ) +\n\u2212\n\u226a log A(\u03b7) + nE log x +\n(log A(\u03b7) + nE log T ) , (12)\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nT\n\u03c1=\u03b2+i\u03b3\n|\u03b3|<T\n\n\u03c1=\u03b2+i\u03b3\n|\u03c1|< 12\n\nwhere both sums are taken over the nontrivial zeros \u03c1 of L(s; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7) and the implied\nconstant is absolute. If, however, T does coincide with the imaginary part of some zero \u03c1,\nwe may argue as in [10, p.451] and correct the problem (by simply increasing the constant\nimplied by the \u226a notation).\nBy Lemma 1, if \u03c1 = \u03b2 + i\u03b3 6= \u03b2\u03b7 is not an exceptional zero of L(s; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7) and |\u03b3| < T ,\nthen\n\u001a\n\u001b\nc1 log x\n\u03c1\n|x | \u2264 x exp \u2212\n.\nL(T )\nLet N\u03b7 (t) denote the number of nontrivial zeros \u03c1 = \u03b2 + i\u03b3 of L(s; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b7) satisfying the\ncondition |\u03b3 \u2212 t| \u2264 1. By Lemma 5.4 of [10, p. 436], N\u03b7 (t) \u226a log A(\u03b7) + nE log(|t| + 2).\n7\n\n\fThus,\nX\n\n\u03c1=\u03b2+i\u03b3\n\u03c16=\u03b2\u03b7\n|\u03c1|\u22651/2\n|\u03b3|<T\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nc1 log x X N\u03b7 (j)\nx\u03c1\n\u226a x exp \u2212\n\u03c1\nL(T ) j<T j\n\u001a\n\nc1 log x\n\u226a x exp \u2212\nL(T )\n\n\u001b\n\n(log A(\u03b7) + nE log T ) log T,\n\nthe implied constants being absolute.

That is, we let L/K be a\nGalois (not necessarily Abelian) extension of number fields with group G. Further, we let C\nbe a fixed conjugacy class in G, and we let \u03b4C denote the characteristic function of C. Given\na Dirichlet character \u03c7 modulo q, we now wish to approximate\nX\n\u03b8(x; \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7) =\n\u03c7(Np) log Np.\nNp\u2264x\n\n=C\n( L/K\np )\n\nIn the proofs, it will be more convenient to work with \u03c8e instead of \u03b8.

Since [L(\u03b6q ) : Q(\u03b6q )] = \u03c6K (q)nL /\u03c6(q), by Lemma 7 of [22, p. 143], we\nhave |dL(\u03b6q ) | \u2264 |dL |\u03c6K (q) * |dQ(\u03b6q ) |nL \u03c6K (q)/\u03c6(q) .

Now, let G\u22a5\nK,q denote the subgroup of Dirichlet characters modulo\nq that are trivial on GK,q . Then two Dirichlet characters \u03c71 , \u03c72 define the same map on GK,q\nwhenever \u03c71 \u2261 \u03c72 (mod G\u22a5\nK,q ). Throughout, we will reserve the notation \u03c70 for the trivial\nDirichlet character modulo q. That is, \u03c70 (a) = 1 if (a, q) = 1 and \u03c70 (a) = 0 otherwise.\nLemma 2. There exists a positive constant c4 (L) so that for any Dirichlet character modulo\nq \u2264 x with \u03c7 \u2261 \u03c70 (mod G\u22a5\nK,q ), we have\nn\no\np\n|C|\n\u03b8(x; \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7) \u2212\nx \u226a x exp \u2212c4 (L) log x ,\n|G|\n\nwhere the implied constant depends only on L.\n\nProof. Properties of L-functions imply that\ne L(\u03b6q )/K, \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7) = \u03c8(x;\ne L(\u03b6q )/K, \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c70 ) = \u03c8(x;\ne L/K, \u03b4C ).\n\u03c8(x;\n\nBy the Effective Chebotar\u00ebv Density Theorem [10, p. 458], we obtain\no\u0011\n\u0010\nn\n\u03b20\np\ne L/K, \u03b4C ) = |C| x \u2212 |C| x + O x exp \u2212c5 n\u22121/2 log x ,\n\u03c8(x;\nL\n|G|\n|G| \u03b20\n\n(15)\n\nwhere c5 is an absolute positive constant, \u03b20 is a potential \"exceptional zero\" of the Dedekind\nzeta function for L, and the convention is that the term involving \u03b20 should be removed if\n9\n\n\f\u03b20 does not exist. Furthermore, the constant implied by the big-O is absolute. See [10,\npp. 413-414] for the precise definition of \u03b20 . Stark's bound gives\n\u03b20 < max{1 \u2212 1/(4 log |dL |), 1 \u2212 c6 /|dL |1/nL }.\nSee [15, p. 249] or [22, p. 148] for example.

For q smaller than a power of log x,\nwe apply Proposition 1 and the technique of Deuring [6] and Macluer [13] to obtain good\nbounds for \u03b8(x; \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7).\nLemma 3. Let M > 0 and q \u2264 (log x)M .

Ideally, one would like to begin by decomposing \u03b4C as a linear combination of irree L(\u03b6q )/K, \u03b7 \u2297 \u03c7)|. However,\nducible characters \u03b7 of G and then obtain good bounds for |\u03c8(x;\nthis is complicated by the fact that \u03b7 and hence \u03b7 \u2297 \u03c7 may be associated to a representation \u03c1 of Gal(L(\u03b6q )/K) of dimension greater than one. In fact, unless the extension L/K is\nAbelian, there will always be at least one such \u03b7. See [18, p. 25] for example.\nWe instead employ the argument of Deuring [6] and MacCluer [13] to reduce to the case of\none dimensional characters. See also [15, pp. 246, 250] and [10, pp. 429-430]. In particular,\nwe choose some Abelian subgroup H of G so that H \u2229 C 6= {}. Note that if gC \u2208 C, then\nH = hgC i is one possible choice. Now, take hC \u2208 H \u2229 C, and let CH denote the conjugacy\nclass of hC in H. Then\n|C| * |H|\n\u03b4C =\nIndG\nH \u03b4CH .\n|G| * |CH |\nPut Hq := H \u00d7 GK,q . By Mackey's Induction Theorem [18, p. 57], we have\n\u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7 =\n\n|C| * |H|\nG\nIndHqq (\u03b4CH \u2297 \u03c7),\n|G| * |CH |\n\nwhere we are using the same symbol \u03c7 to represent the character on Gq and the associated\ncharacter on Hq . Now, let E be the subfield of L(\u03b6q ) fixed by Hq , and note that E does not\ndepend on q since it is also the subfield of L fixed by H. By the invariance of L-functions\nunder induction, we have\ne L(\u03b6q )/K, IndGq (\u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7))\ne L(\u03b6q )/K, \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7) = |C| * |H| \u03c8(x;\n\u03c8(x;\nH\nHq\n|G| * |CH |\n|C| * |H| e\n\u03c8(x; L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03b4CH \u2297 \u03c7).\n=\n|G| * |CH |\n10\n\n\fNow we may write\n\u03b4CH =\n\n|CH | X\n\u03c9(hC )\u03c9,\n|H| \u03c9\n\nwhere \u03c9 ranges over all the irreducible (one-dimensional) characters of H. Thus,\nX\ne L(\u03b6q )/E, \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7)|.\ne L(\u03b6q )/K, \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c7)| \u2264 |C|\n|\u03c8(x;\n|\u03c8(x;\n|G| \u03c9\n\n(17)\n\nSince \u03c7 6\u2261 \u03c70 (mod G\u22a5\nK,q ), it follows that \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7 is not trivial. By (10) and the conductordiscriminant formula,\nX\nlog A(\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c7) \u2264 log (|dL |q nL ) .\n\u03c9\n\nThe result now follows by applying Proposition 1 to (17) and using (14).\n\n\u0003\n\n5. Proof of Theorem 1\nGiven two Dirichlet characters, say \u03c71 and \u03c72 , it follows that \u03b8(x; \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c71 ) = \u03b8(x; \u03b4C \u2297 \u03c72 )\nif \u03c71 \u2261 \u03c72 (mod G\u22a5\nK,q ).
