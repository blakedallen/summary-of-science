Furthermore, a well-developed confinement scenario exists in the Coulomb gauge\nthat was developed by Gribov and elaborated by one of us [1, 2]. Recently, it has\nalso been shown that Coulomb gauge furnishes an upper limit for the physical stringtension and static quark-anti-quark potential already at the level of the two-point\nfunctions [3, 4, 5]. Coulomb gauge can also be understood as a gauge which in a certain\nsense is physical: Unlike e.g. in covariant gauges, perturbatively unphysical gauge-fixing\ndegrees of freedom do not propagate. Finally, its structure makes it especially suited for\ncalculations at finite temperature. The results obtained in this gauge can also provide\nReinhard Alkofer * Axel Maas\nInstitute for Physics, Karl-Franzens University Graz, Universit\u00e4tsplatz 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria\nDaniel Zwanziger\nNew York University, New York, NY 10003, USA\n\n\f2\n\ninput to model calculations (see e. g. [6]) in the form of potentials, and is by this\nrelevant to the work (e. g. [7]) of the jubilee to whom this volume and this work is\ndedicated.\nThese are particular advantages of the Coulomb gauge compared to, e.g., covariant\ngauges. However, these properties do come at the price of loosing explicit covariance,\nand therefore introducing a much more complicated structure in the mathematical\ndescription. As a consequence, the question of renormalizability [2, 8, 9, 10] of this gauge\nis a very hard problem. Furthermore, the lack of covariance makes explicit calculations\ncumbersome even in perturbation theory [9, 10].\nTherefore, the determination of the Green's functions in the perturbative and nonperturbative domain is far less developed than in covariant gauges. Nonetheless, we\nwill present an attempt at such a calculation in the far infrared regions by means of\na method which has proven to be rather useful in Landau gauge [11, 12, 13, 14], an\nasymptotic analysis in terms of critical Green's functions. We attempt no full solution\nof the infinite tower of Green's functions, as is possible in Landau gauge [13, 14], and\nwill also restrict to the case of Yang-Mills theory, thus neglecting quarks. For this\npurpose, the first-order formulation will be used. A possible translation to the more\nwidespread used second-order formalism can, in principle, be made using the translation\nprescription discussed in [15].\nIt is a remarkable fact that such calculations in Coulomb gauge in two dimensions\ncan be done analytically [16]. The results of these calculations confirm the scenario,\nwhich will be used throughout this work. This result is, of course, due to the strong\nconstraints the Coulomb gauge imposes specifically in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the situation is much more complex, and many attempts to obtain the Green's\nfunctions [17], in particular using variational principles [18] and lattice calculations [19,\n20, 21, 22], have been performed.\nWe proceed as follows. General aspects of the Coulomb gauge and the first-order\nformalism are discussed in section (2), and the corresponding DSEs in section (3). In\nsection (2) we also introduce a novel on-shell BRST-type operator r and show that\nthe left-hand side of Gauss' law is r-exact. The truncation employed here, described in\nsection (4), provide a consistent result at the level of power-counting. Unfortunately,\nif a linear rising Coulomb potential is required, this solution ceases to exist, as is\ndiscussed in detail in section (4.4). This persists even when including consistent vertex\nmodifications, as is discussed in section (5). The results provide an example where a\nsolution exists by power counting, but is not a solution of the system. Of course, this\nmay be an artifact of truncation. The results of the investigation are then summarized\nin section (6).\n\n2 General aspects of Coulomb gauge in the first order formalism\n2.1 Phase-space action\nThe local Euclidean action in Coulomb gauge in phase-space or first-order formalism\nin s spatial dimensions is\nS=\n\nZ\n\nh\ni\n1\nds+1 x i\u03c0i (\u22020 Ai \u2212 Di A0 ) + (\u03c0 2 + B 2 ) + \u2202i c\u0304Di c + i\u2202i bAi ,\n2\n\n\f3\n\nwhere\nBia = Bia (A) = \u01ebijk (\u2202j Ak +\n\n1\ngAj \u00d7 Ak )\n2\n\nis the color-magnetic field, and\n(A \u00d7 B)a \u2261 f abc Ab B c .\nHere c and c\u0304 are the ghost pair, and Di = Di (A) is the gauge covariant derivative,\nDi c = \u2202i c + gAi \u00d7 c. All fields are understood to carry a color index in the adjoint\nrepresentation that is contracted. The field b is a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the\nCoulomb gauge condition \u2202i Ai = 0. Here \u03c0i is an auxiliary field that represents an\nindependent color-electric field.\nThe Euclidean phase-space measure is\nZ\ndAi dA0 d\u03c0 dc dc\u0304 db exp(\u2212S).\nIf one integrates out \u03c0i , one gets the second-order or Lagrangian Euclidean action in\nCoulomb gauge.\nAs in the Landau gauge [23], it will be assumed henceforth that a non-perturbative\nrealization of the Coulomb gauge exists which furnishes a globally well-defined and\nunbroken BRST symmetry1 . If this is the case, an analogue to the classical Gauss' law\ncan be formulated using the BRST symmetry, as explained below. As a consequence,\ncertain relations between the renormalization constants of Coulomb gauge have to hold,\nin particular ZA0 = Zc , relating the ghost renormalization with that of the temporal\ngluon propagator [2].\n\n2.2 On-shell action and on-shell BRST operator\nWe integrate out the auxiliary b-field, so that the gauge condition \u2202i Ai = 0 is satisfied\nidentically (on-shell). Writing Ai = AT\ni , the on-shell action\nZ\nh\ni\n1 2\n2\nSos = ds+1 x i\u03c0i (\u22020 AT\ni \u2212 Di A0 ) + (\u03c0 + B ) + \u2202i c\u0304Di c ,\n2\nis obtained, where B = B(AT ), and D = D(AT ).\nSince the gauge condition is satisfied identically, it is appropriate to restrict the\nintegration over AT to the fundamental modular region \u039b, a region free of Gribov\ncopies. The other variables are unrestricted, and the path integral is given by\nZ\ndAT d\u03c0 dA0 dc dc\u0304 exp(\u2212Sos ).\n(1)\n\u039b\n\nIn the phase-space action, A0 appears as a Lagrange multiplier, and if one integrates\nout A0 , one obtains \u03b4(Di \u03c0i ), which imposes Gauss' law2 Di \u03c0i = 0. Note that the\n1 The problem of the existence of a globally well-defined BRST charge in this gauge is not yet\nsolved, and similar considerations as in Landau gauge apply [23, 24]. However, a construction\nas proposed in Landau gauge [24, 25] may also be possible in Coulomb gauge. Furthermore,\nthe existence of a conserved and vanishing global color charge [26] may also be helpful in this\nrespect.\n2 In the presence of quarks one would have instead \u03b4(D \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c1 ).\nqu\ni i\n\n\f4\n\nintegrand vanishes on the boundary of the Gribov region, after integrating out the\n\u03c0-field, because the Faddeev-Popov determinant vanishes there, and hence the DysonSchwinger equations (DSEs) are unchanged by a cut-off there [27].\nFor purposes of deriving the DSEs, it is preferable not to integrate out A0 because\nthat would produce a non-polynomial action. Instead we exhibit an on-shell BRST-type\noperator which encodes Gauss' law, and provides a definition of physical observables3 .\nThe on-shell BRST-type operator r is defined by\nrAT\ni = r\u03c0i = 0;\n\nrc\u0304 = iDi \u03c0i ;\nrA0 = \u2202i Di c;\n\nrc = 0.\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nAn operator similar to r was introduced in eq. (143) of [8]. These equations imply that\nr is nilpotent, r 2 = 0. Moreover it is a symmetry of Sos ,\nrSos = 0,\nas one sees by writing the on-shell action in the form\nZ\ni\nh\n1 2\n2\nSos = d4 x i\u03c0i \u22020 AT\ni + (\u03c0 + B ) + r(c\u0304A0 ) .\n2\nThe r-symmetry is compatible with the restriction to the fundamental modular region \u039b\nof the integral (1) over AT because rAT = 0.\nWe identify physical observables with the cohomology of r. With this definition of\nobservables, one sees from (2) and (3) that the variables AT\ni and \u03c0i are physical, while\n(A0 , c, c\u0304, Di \u03c0i ) form an unphysical quartet. Any r-exact quantity rX has vanishing\nexpectation value hrXi = 0, and is physically equivalent to 0, rX \u223c 0. Gauss' law is\nencoded in the r-symmetry because, according to (2), Di \u03c0i is an r-exact quantity, and\nis thus equivalent to 0, Di \u03c0i \u223c 0. The r-symmetry is not as powerful as the BRST\nsymmetry because it does not determine the part of the action that is not r-exact.\nHowever it does imply the cancellation of the instantaneous ghost and scalar loops\nwhich contain the notorious energy divergences of the Coulomb gauge.\nIn the BRST formalism AT\ni and \u03c0i are not physical. However here they can be\nbecause the gauge is fixed on-shell. To make contact with the usual Coulomb gauge,\nin which only the transverse degrees of freedom are considered physical, we separate\nthe \u03c0-field into transverse and longitudinal parts, \u03c0i = \u03c0iT \u2212 \u2202i \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the colorCoulomb potential, and \u2202i \u03c0iT = 0. These fields satisfy\nT\nrAT\ni = r\u03c0i = 0\n\nr(M\n\n\u22121\n\nc\u0304) = i(\u03c6 \u2212 M\n\n\u22121\n\n(4)\n\u03c1);\n\nr\u03c6 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1 \u2261 g \u03c0iT \u00d7 AT\ni\n\n(6)\n\nis the color-charge density of the transverse degrees of freedom, and we have used\nT\nr(M \u22121 c\u0304) = M \u22121 iDi \u03c0i = iM \u22121 (\u2212Di \u2202i \u03c6 + gAT\ni \u00d7 \u03c0i ).\n\n(7)\n\n3 We note that this operator is affected by the same lack of knowledge concerning its global\ndefinition as in case of the BRST symmetry. Once more, we assume that it is globally welldefined.\n\n\f5\n\nHere\n\nM \u2261 \u2212\u2202i Di (AT ) = \u2212Di (AT )\u2202i\n\n(8)\n\nis the Faddeev-Popov operator, and the last equality holds because AT\ni is transverse. We\nT\nsee by the preceding definition that AT\ni and \u03c0i are physical, as in the usual Coulomb\ngauge, whereas \u03c6 is physically equivalent to M \u22121 \u03c1,\n\u03c6 \u223c M \u22121 \u03c1,\nbecause they differ by an r-exact term, and moreover M \u22121 \u03c1 is a function of the transT\nverse degrees of freedom AT\ni and \u03c0i . In the usual Coulomb gauge, the color-Coulomb\n\u22121\nfield has the value \u03c6 = M \u03c1.\n\n3 Dyson-Schwinger equations\nWith the separation \u03c0i = \u03c0iT \u2212 \u2202i \u03c6, the on-shell action becomes\nZ\nn\n1 T 2\nSos =\nds+1 x i\u03c0iT \u22020 AT\ni + [(\u03c0 )\n2\n\no\n+(\u2202i \u03c6)2 + B 2 ] + i\u2202i \u03c6Di A0 \u2212 ig\u03c0iT (AT\ni \u00d7 A0 ) + \u2202i c\u0304Di c .\n\n(9)\n\nTransverse propagators are expressed in terms of scalar quantities by\nZ\nexp(ik * x)\nTb\nab\nT\nds+1 k\nhATa\nPij (k)DAA\n(k)\ni (x)Aj (0)i = \u03b4\n(2\u03c0)s+1\n\netc., where Pij (k) = \u03b4ij \u2212 ki kj /k2 is the projector onto the transverse subspace.

The full expressions will be\ngiven only for those contributions present after truncation. A full set of DSEs could\nbe generated, e. g., using the method described in [29]. An independent derivation of\nthese equations can also be found in [10]. No consequences of additional mixed propagators have been included, because even if they are non-zero, they do not survive the\nproposed truncation.

For simplicity, here the tree-level\nexpressions will be used, and only commented on, if some argument no longer holds\nwhen using non-tree-level vertices.\n\n4.1 Instantaneous parts of propagators\nIn general the propagators depend on two variables, D(k) = D(|k|, k0 ). However in\nCoulomb gauge the propagators of the scalar degrees of freedom contain instantaneous\nparts DI , proportional to \u03b4(t), and these, in momentum space, depend on a single\nvariable DI (|k|). Here we shall identify the instantaneous parts of propagators.\nIn the phase space action (9), the only time derivative occurs in the term i\u03c0iT \u22020 AT\ni .\nAccordingly we suppose that the propagators of the transverse degrees of freedom contain no instantaneous parts, but that the scalar fields may have instantaneous parts\nproportional to \u03b4(t). It can be shown by appropriately integrating out fields that propagators of the scalar fields may be expressed as\n\u03b4 ab Dcc\u0304 (x \u2212 y) = h (M \u22121 )ab (x, y) i\n\u03b4 ab iDA0 \u03c6 (x \u2212 y) = h (M \u22121 )ab (x, y) \u2212 (K\u03c1)a (x) (M \u22121 \u03c1)b (y) i\n\u03b4 ab DA0 A0 (x \u2212 y) = h K ab (x, y) \u2212 (K\u03c1)a (x) (K\u03c1)b (y) i\n\u03b4 ab D\u03c6\u03c6 (x \u2212 y) = h (M \u22121 \u03c1)a (x) (M \u22121 \u03c1)b (y) i,\n\n\f10\n\nwhere K is the operator with kernel\nK ab (x, y) \u2261 [M \u22121 (\u2212\u22072 )M \u22121 ]ab (x, y).\n\n(20)\n\nT\nWe have \u03c1 = g\u03c0iT \u00d7 AT\ni and M = \u2212\u2202i Di (A ) so the quantities on the right depend\nonly on the transverse degrees of freedom. The propagators of the scalar fields contain\ninstantaneous parts because the kernel M \u22121 (x, y) = M \u22121 (x, y)\u03b4(x0 \u2212 y0 ) is instantaneous, and consequently so is K(x, y) = K(x, y)\u03b4(x0 \u2212 y0 ).\nAssuming that the transverse fields do not contribute to the instantaneous parts,\nthe last equations give the decomposition of the propagators into instantaneous (I) and\nnon-instantaneous (N) parts, which reads in momentum space\n\nDcc\u0304 (k) = DIcc\u0304 (|k|)\nDA0 \u03c6 (k) = DIA0 \u03c6 (|k|) + DN A0 \u03c6 (k)\nDA0 A0 (k) = DIA0 A0 (|k|) + DN A0 A0 (k)\nD\u03c6\u03c6 (k) = DN \u03c6\u03c6 (k).\nMoreover we have the equality of the instantaneous Bose and Fermi propagators\niDIA0 \u03c6 (|k|) = DIcc\u0304 (|k|).\n\n(21)\n\nwhich may be shown to be a consequence of the r-symmetry.\nThe ghost propagator Dcc\u0304 (|k|) is purely instantaneous. The integral over p0 in (19)\nyields\nZ\n1\nT\ndp0 DAA\n(p) = D=AA (|p|),\n(22)\n2\u03c0\nwhere D=AA (|k|) is the equal-time AT -AT propagator in momentum space.

Therefore, everything in this subsection also applies to this case.\n\n4.2 Instantaneous approximation and infrared limit\nWe wish to explore the hypothesis that there exists an asymptotic infrared limit of the\nDSEs which is dominated by loops containing an instantaneous propagator. As Ansatz\nwe suppose that we may neglect loops that contain no instantaneous propagators on\nthe RHS of the DSEs for scalar propagators, eqs. (15) \u2013 (17). This is equivalent to the\nsubstitutions on the RHS\nD\u03c6\u03c6 (|k|, k0 ) \u2192 DI\u03c6\u03c6 (|k|) = 0\nDA0 A0 (|k|, k0 ) \u2192 DIA0 A0 (|k|)\niDA0 \u03c6 (|k|, k0 ) \u2192 iDIA0 \u03c6 (|k|) = Dcc\u0304 (|k|).\n\n(24)\n\n\f11\n\nEquations (15) \u2013 (17) then yield on the LHS\n\u0393 A0 A0 = 0\n\u2212i\u0393I\u03c6A0 = \u0393c\u0304c\n\u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (|k|) = k2 +\n\nN g 2 k2\n(2\u03c0)s\n\nZ\n\nds p [1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2 ]D=AA (|p|) DIA0 A0 (|p \u2212 k|),\n\n(25)\n\nwhich are all consistent with our Ansatz. We have\n\u2212\u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (|k|)\n2 (|k|)\n\u0393A\n0\u03c6\n\n(26)\n\nDIA0 A0 (|k|)\n.\n2 (|k|)\nDcc\u0304\n\n(27)\n\nDIA0 A0 (|k|) =\nwhich gives\n\u0393\u03c6\u03c6 (|k|) =\nThis implies\nDIA0 A0 (|k|)\nN g 2 k2\n2\n=\nk\n+\n2 (|k|)\n(2\u03c0)s\nDcc\u0304\n\nZ\n\nds p [1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2 ]D=AA (|p|) DIA0 A0 (|p \u2212 k|).\n\n(28)\n\nThe pair of equations (23) and (28) determine the two propagators Dcc\u0304 (|k|) and\nDIA0 A0 (|k|), provided that D=AA (|k|) is known.\nWe now consider the DSEs for the transverse propagators. We make the same\napproximation DA0 A0 (k) \u2192 DIA0 A0 (|k|) into the RHS of (14) which yields the integral\nZ\nT\ndp0 DA\u03c0\n(p) = 0,\n(29)\nT\nwhich vanishes in the present approximation because DA\u03c0\n(p0 , |p|) is odd in p0 , as one\nsees from the tree-level term in (14), and as will be verified below. This gives\nT\n\u0393\u03c0A\n(|k|) = \u2212k0 .\n\n(30)\n\nWe make the same substitution DA0 A0 \u2192 DIA0 A0 in (13) and obtain\nT\n\u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|k|) = 1 +\n\nN g2\n(2\u03c0)s\n\nZ\n\nds p\n\ns \u2212 2 + (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2\nD=AA (|p|) DIA0 A0 (|k \u2212 p|).\ns\u22121\n\n(31)\n\nT\nThere is no k0 dependence on the RHS, so, as indicated, \u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|k|) depends on the one\nvariable |k|.\nT\nThere remains to consider the DSE for \u0393AA\n. Upon making the substitution iDA0 \u03c6 \u2192\nDcc\u0304 into the RHS of (11) in the loops that contain instantaneous pieces, one finds\nthat the loop of scalar bosons DIA0 \u03c6 (p)DIA0 \u03c6 (p \u2212 k) exactly cancels the ghost loop\nDcc\u0304 (p)Dcc\u0304 (p \u2212 k). This is a crucial cancellation, and it holds in this truncation only\nwith tree-level vertices. Beyond such vertices, this is non-trivial, and implies constraints\nwhich will be discussed in section 5. Of course, in the full solution this would be guaranteed by the r symmetry.\nThis leaves only one loop in the equation, and we obtain\nT\n\u0393AA\n(|k|) = k2 +\n\nN g2\n(2\u03c0)s\n\nZ\n\nds p\n\ns \u2212 2 + (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2\nD=\u03c0\u03c0 (|p|) DIA0 A0 (|k \u2212 p|).\ns\u22121\n\n(32)\n\n\f12\nT\nAgain there is no k0 dependence on the RHS, so \u0393AA\n(|k|) is a function of |k| only.\nIt should be noted that there is a certain ambiguity involved here: In the DSE\nT\n(11) for \u0393AA\nthere is a cross term DIA0 \u03c6 (p)DN A0 \u03c6 (p \u2212 k) containing an instantaneous\npropagator (I) multiplying a non-instantaneous propagator (N), which in principle\nshould be kept. However, if we keep the one instantaneous part on the RHS of the DSE\n(17) for \u0393\u03c6A0 , then \u0393\u03c6A0 comes out purely instantaneous, so within our approximation\nDN \u03c6A0 = 0, and we have no way to calculate a non-zero value for this quantity. This\nis self-consistent. However, this assumption may be one of the reasons for the failure\nof finding a solution with the desired properties in this truncation.\nUsing the results of the last three equations, we see that the transverse \u0393 -matrix\nis given by\n!\nT\n\u0393AA\n(|k|)\nk0\nT\n\u2212k0 \u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|k|)\n\nThe elements of the inverse matrix are thus\nT\nT\nDAA\n(k0 , |k|) = \u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|k|)/Q\nT\nDA\u03c0\n(k0 , |k|) = \u2212k0 /Q\n\nwhere\n\nT\nT\nD\u03c0\u03c0\n(k0 , |k|) = \u0393AA\n(|k|)/Q,\n\n(33)\n\nT\nT\nQ = k02 + \u0393AA\n(|k|) \u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|k|).\n\n(34)\n\nT\nDA\u03c0\n(k0 , |k|)\n\nWe see that\nis odd in k0 , as asserted.\nIt follows that the equal-time propagators that appear on the RHS of the DS\nequations are given by\nZ\n1\nT\ndp0 DAA\n(p)\nD=AA (|p|) =\n2\u03c0\nZ\nT\nT\n1 h \u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n1\n(|p|) i1/2\n\u0393\u03c0\u03c0\n(|p|)\n=\n,\n=\ndp0 2\nT\nT\nT\n2\u03c0\n2 \u0393AA (|p|)\np0 + \u0393AA (|p|) \u0393\u03c0\u03c0 (|p|)\nand similarly\n\nD=\u03c0\u03c0 (|p|) =\nThis implies that\n\nT\n(|p|) i1/2\n1 h \u0393AA\n.\nT\n2 \u0393\u03c0\u03c0 (|p|)\n\n(35)\n\n1 \u22121\nD\n(|p|),\n(36)\n4 =AA\nso there is only one unknown function of one variable.

By\n\u2206 (k )\nthe last inequality, this dominates k2 at low k, and we conclude that the tree-level\nterm in (28) is negligible in the infrared, and (28) simplifies to\n\nDIA0 A0 (|k|)\nN g 2 k2\n=\n2\n(2\u03c0)s\nDcc\u0304 (|k|)\n\nZ\n\nds p [1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * p\u0302)2 ]D=AA (|p|) DIA0 A0 (|p \u2212 k|).\n\n(45)\n\nThis equation is also invariant under RG transformations.\nWe substitute the power laws (39) into this equation, and upon equating powers\nof momenta, we again obtain (41).

(38) for the transverse propagator. We shall show that at small\nk the loop integral dominates the tree-level terms. The tree-level terms on the l.h.s.\nare of order |k|\u22122\u03baT = |k|4\u03ba\u2206 +4\u2212s and |k|2+2\u03baT = |k|s\u22122\u22124\u03ba\u2206 respectively. The ratio\nof these terms is |k|8\u03ba\u2206 +6\u22122s . From the inequality (42) we have \u03ba\u2206 > 0, so this power\nis positive for s \u2264 3. Thus, at small momentum the second tree-level term |k|s\u22122\u22124\u03ba\u2206\ndominates the first. Moreover the dimension of the r.h.s. is |k|s\u22122\u22122\u03baV , so it, in turn\ndominates the second tree-level term by the inequality (44), \u03baV > 2\u03ba\u2206 . We conclude\nthat the loop integral in (38) dominates both tree-level terms in the infrared asymptotic\nlimit, and this equation simplifies to\n0=\n\nN g2\n(2\u03c0)s\n\nZ\n\nds p [s \u2212 2 + (p\u0302 * k\u0302)2 ] DIA0 A0 (|k \u2212 p|)\n\nhD\n\n=AA (|p|)\n\nD=AA (|k|)\n\n\u2212\n\nD=AA (|k|) i\n.

So the obvious solution to (48), namely \u03baT = \u22121, does not give a consistent\nsolution for s \u2264 2.\n\n\f15\n\n4.4 Determination of critical exponents\nWe substitute the value just obtained, \u03ba\u2206 = (s\u22122)/4, into (47) and obtain an equation\nfor \u03baV ,\n\u0393 ( 6\u2212s\n( s\u22122\n4 ) \u0393 (s/2 \u2212 \u03baV ) \u0393 (\u03baV \u2212 s/2 + 1)\n4 )\n.\n(52)\n=\n\u0393 (1 + \u03baV ) \u0393 (s \u2212 \u03baV )\n\u0393 ( 3s+2\n4 )\nTo simplify this equation, we use the identity\n\u0393 (s/2 \u2212 \u03baV ) \u0393 (\u03baV \u2212 s/2 + 1) =\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n=\n.\nsin[\u03c0(s/2 \u2212 \u03baV )]\ncos(\u03c0\u03ba\u2032V )\n\nHere the shifted variable \u03ba\u2032V is defined by\n\u03ba\u2032V \u2261 \u03baV \u2212 (s \u2212 1)/2,\n\n(53)\n\n\u2212 1/2 < \u03ba\u2032V < 1/2.\n\n(54)\n\nand the bounds (51) read\nThe shifted variable\n\n\u03ba\u2032V\n\nis determined by\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\ns+1\n3s+2\ncos(\u03c0\u03ba\u2032V ) \u0393 [( s+1\n( s\u22122\n2 ) + \u03baV ] \u0393 [( 2 ) \u2212 \u03baV ]\n4 ) \u0393( 4 )\n=\n.\n6\u2212s\n\u03c0\n\u0393( 4 )\n\n(55)\n\nThe l.h.s. is symmetric about \u03ba\u2032V = 0, so if \u03ba\u2032V is a solution so is \u2212\u03ba\u2032V . Note that \u03ba\u2032V = 0\n2\nbV\nis equivalent to \u03baV = s\u22121\n2 , or g DIA0 A0 = (k2 )(s+1)/2 . This describes a linearly rising\ncolor-Coulomb potential in spatial dimension s.\nOur results are not unreasonable at the physical value s = 3. Indeed, at s = 3,\n(1/4)\u0393 (11/4)\n= 21/64 \u2248 0.328, while in\nthe r.h.s. of the last equation has the value\n\u0393 (3/4)\nthe allowed interval (54), the l.h.s. of (55) has a maximum at \u03ba\u2032V = 0 where it has\nthe value 1/\u03c0 \u2248 0.318. Thus for s = 3 the two sides agree to within 3%, at \u03ba\u2032V = 0,\nwhich describes a linearly rising color-Coulomb potential, in accordance with numerical\nsimulations [30].\nNote, however, that the maximum of the l.h.s. of (55) in the allowed interval is\n1/\u03c0, and 1/\u03c0 < 21/64. Hence, strictly speaking, there is no real solution at s = 3. As\ns decreases from s = 3, a real solution develops at \u03ba\u2032V = 0 and s = sc , where sc is a\ncritical dimension that satisfies (55) at \u03ba\u2032V = 0,\n3s+2\n\u0393 2 ( s+1\n( s\u22122\n2 )\n4 ) \u0393( 4 )\n=\n,\n\u03c0\n\u0393 ( 6\u2212s\n4 )\n\n(56)\n\nsc \u2248 2.9665.\n\n(57)\n\nnamely\n\u03ba\u2032V\n\nRecall that\n= 0 is equivalent to \u03baV = (sc \u2212 1)/2, and this corresponds to a linearly\nrising color-Coulomb potential at s = sc . As s decreases below the critical dimension\nsc , the solution \u03ba\u2032V = 0 bifurcates into two solutions that approach \u03ba\u2032V = \u00b11/2, as s\napproaches s = 2. Although neither of the two branches corresponds to a linearly rising\ncolor-Coulomb potential, it is intriguing that the average of the two solutions \u00b1\u03ba\u2032V is\n\u03ba\u2032V = 0, or \u03baV = (s \u2212 1)/2, and this describes a linearly rising potential for all s.\nWe have seen that there is no consistent solution for s < 2, and in fact the r.h.s.\nof (55) is negative for s < 2, whereas the l.h.s. is positive for \u03ba\u2032V in the allowed interval (54). The question, whether vertex corrections could provide a consistent solution\n\n\f16\n\nwill be discussed in section 5. Unfortunately, it turns out that this is not the case, at\nleast, at the next-to-trivial level.\nDespite the near success in s = 3 spatial dimensions, we consider the failure at\ns = 2 to indicate a serious flaw of the present truncation scheme.\n\n4.5 Infrared fixed point of running coupling constant\nIn [32], a running coupling constant was defined in gauges that interpolate between\nthe Landau gauge and the Coulomb gauge. It was found that in Landau gauge and in\nall interpolating gauges this running coupling has an infrared fixed point\n\u03b1interpolating (0) =\n\n8.915\n.\nN\n\n(58)\n\nIn Coulomb gauge this infrared fixed point is given [32] by the formula (in present\nnotation)\n4b2 b\n\u03b1coulomb (0) = \u2206 T .\n(59)\n3\u03c0\nHowever the Coulomb gauge is a singular limit of the interpolating gauge, and the\nmethods used in [32] were not sufficient to determine the numerical value of the infrared\nfixed point in Coulomb gauge. However our (near) solution of the Coulomb-gauge DSE\nprovides a value. We take spatial dimension s = 3, for which \u03ba\u2206 in (50) has the value\n\u03ba\u2206 = 1/4, and substitute these values into (43). This gives\n(bT b2\u2206 )\u22121 =\n\n4N\n,\n21\u03c0\n\n(60)\n\nand we obtain\n\n7\n.\n(61)\nN\nIt is not clear what is the origin of the difference between interpolating gauges and the\nCoulomb gauge. There could be a discontinuity but, if so, the discontinuity is not very\nlarge. Note, however, that different approximations are made in the two calculations.\nIndeed here we used the phase space representation for the Coulomb gauge, whereas in\ninterpolating gauges the configuration space representation was used, so the truncation\nschemes are not identical even though both use tree-level vertices. Furthermore, lattice\ninvestigations of the Coulomb gauge limit of the interpolating gauge suggest also a\nsmooth limit, except at zero momentum [20].\n\u03b1coulomb (0) =\n\n5 Vertices beyond tree-level\nSince the truncation proposed ultimately has failed, it is necessary to reconsider it. The\nsimplest way is to include vertex correction, and check, whether they can be arranged\nsuch as to arrive at a consistent solution5 . The most primitive vertex modification\nin this truncation is to keep the tree-level Lorentz structure, but to include a scalar\ndressing function for each vertex appearing. In particular, these corrections will also\nbe of instantaneous type. This implies that only the DSEs (38), (40), and (45) are\naffected, as all the other consequences of the truncation remain valid.\n5\n\nNote that a similar program has also bee pursued in Landau gauge in [31].\n\n\f17\n\nExcept for one important caveat. One of the central elements in the truncation so far\nwas the cancellation of the ghost loop and the \u03c6A0 -loop in the DSE for the transverse\ngluon propagator. That is true at one-loop order in perturbative calculations, since the\npropagators are identical, apart from a factor i. This identity persists beyond one-loop\nperturbation theory also in the instantaneous approximation employed here. However,\nthis alone does not guarantee the cancellation of the loops. Either the vertices must also\ncoincide, or their differences must arrange, in a subtle way, to allow the cancellation, at\nleast, for the purpose at hand, the cancellation of the leading infrared part. To achieve\nself-consistency, the cancellation has therefore to be built in into the ans\u00e4tze for the\nvertices.\nTherefore, the DSEs to be satisfied are a system of equations for the three unknown\nfunctions\nD=AT AT\nDG\nD00\nand in addition also have to act as constraint equations which restrict the form of\npossible vertex modifications for the three vertices\n\u0393A\n\nT\n\nc\u0304c\n\n\u0393A\n\nT\n\nA0 \u03c6\n\n\u0393A\n\nT\n\nA0 \u03c0 T\n\n.\n\nThe calculations in section 4 to obtain the DSEs (38), (40), and (45) can still be made\nin the same way, it is only necessary to keep the scalar dressings of the vertices at each\nstep.\nTo solve the equations, the same ans\u00e4tze (39) for the propagators will be made.\nFor the scalar vertex dressings the ans\u00e4tze\n\u0393A\n\u0393A\n\u0393A\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nc\u0304c\n\n(p, q, k) = a\u03b1 p2\u03b1T q 2\u03b1\u2206 k2\u03b1\u2206\n\nA0 \u03c6\n\n(p, q, k) = a\u03b1 p2\u03b1T q 2\u03b1\u2206 k2\u03b1\u2206\n\nA0 \u03c0\n\nT\n\n(p, q, k) = a\u03b2 p2\u03b2T q 2\u03b20 k2\u03b2\u03c0\n\nwill be made. Herein, anticipating a ghost-anti-ghost symmetry as in Landau gauge\n[11], the exponents for the ghost- and anti-ghost-leg of the ghost-gluon vertex have\nbeen set equal. Furthermore, to guarantee exact cancellation of the ghost diagram\nin the transverse gluon equation by the A0 \u03c6 diagram, the parameters of the ghostgluon vertex and the AT A0 \u03c6 have been set equal6 . Finally, \u03b1\u2206 will be set to zero,\nto incorporate the corresponding non-renormalization theorem, which at least exists\nfor the limiting interpolating gauge to Coulomb gauge [32]. Of course, the latter is an\nassumption at this stage. The desired solution should have the property \u03baV = 1 in four\ndimensions (s = 3) and \u03baV = 1/2 in three dimensions (s = 2) to obtain an appropriate\npotential.\nWith power-law ans\u00e4tze and the dimensional renormalization, the integrals can be\nevaluated analytically.

This is\nentirely due to the truncation, which implied tree-level tensor structures and the same\ndressing function for both. Of course, an immediate solution would be then \u03baV = \u03ba\u2206 ,\nbut unfortunately, this is forbidden by integral convergence (42).\nFurthermore, the appearance of the dressing of the ghost and \u03c6-vertices only shift\nthe gluon exponent in the respective equations by \u03b1T , but yields no modification of\nneither the exponent nor the pre-factor consistency conditions. Only in the AT equation\n(69) a consequence would be possible, but it will turn out that this is of minor relevance.\nLet us start with the case s = 3. First of all, the consistency of the exponents on\nboth sides of (67) yields the same relation as from the equation (66),\n0=\n\ns\u22124\n\u2212 \u03baT + \u03b1T \u2212 2\u03ba\u2206 ,\n2\n\n\f19\n\nd\n-0.02\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.08\n\n-0.10\n\n\u039aD\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 4 Top panel: The function d = f (3, \u22121/2 \u2212 2\u03ba\u2206 , \u03ba\u2206 ) \u2212 f (3, \u22121/2 \u2212 2\u03ba\u2206 , 1) within the\npermitted range 0 < \u03ba\u2206 < 1/2 for \u03baV = 1. A zero crossing would indicate a solution to the\nconsistency condition. Bottom panel: The function d = f (3, \u22121/2 \u2212 2\u03ba\u2206 , \u03ba\u2206 ) \u2212 f (3, \u22121/2 \u2212\n2\u03ba\u2206 , \u03baV ). The permitted ranges for \u03ba\u2206 and \u03baV is the lower left triangle of the plot, i. e., the\npart including the origin up to the wall-like structure.\n\n\f20\n\nas \u03baV drops out of both sides of (67). For the tree-level term in equation (67) to be\nsubleading, it is required that 2\u03ba\u2206 < \u03baV , if both are positive. Trying to solve for the\npre-factor consistency condition with this limitation, and the limitations 0 < \u03ba\u2206 <\nmin(1, \u03baV /2) from integral convergence of (66) and (67) and \u03baV < s/2 from equation\n(67), yield that again no solution in three spatial dimensions exists. This is directly\nvisible from the figure 4, left panel. Only if one allows the ghost and the A0 \u03c6 vertices\nto vary independently, is it possible to find a solution. This is then also consistent with\nthe equation (69). However, it is no longer self-consistent. So this is the unfortunate\ncase, where a solution by power-counting exists, but there is however no solution of\nthe system.\nFrom figure 4, right panel, it is clear that relaxing the restriction \u03baV = 1 is not\nsufficient to find a solution: In all cases permitted by integral convergence, no solution\nexists. Only in the sense of section 4.4, if one would permit a deviation of s from 3, a\nsolution could be found in the same manner.\nIn principle, it is possible to relax the integral convergence condition for the equation (67), and admit a logarithmic divergence. In this case, \u03baV = 2\u03ba\u2206 is also possible. This automatically yields that by power-counting all terms scale as the tree-level\nterm. It can therefore no longer be dropped. However, a possible renormalization constant modifies the value of the tree-level constant also by finite parts. This in turn\nmodifies the consistency condition even further. It is then possible to find a solution\nfor the equations (66) and (67). Selecting, e. g., that the finite part of the tree-level\nterm is not modified, and thus a MS-like renormalization scheme, yields a solution as\n(\u03ba\u2206 , \u03baV ) \u2248 (0.66645, 1.3329).\nHowever, even then the case \u03baV = 1 remains pathological, because the function f\ndiverges for the required value \u03ba\u2206 = 1/2.\nIn addition, the case \u03baV = 2\u03ba\u2206 would be due to IR-UV mixing, as the value of\nthe exponent becomes entirely determined by the renormalization prescription, which\nseems undesirable. Still, it would be a solution, and the remaining equation, (69), can\nthen be solved with the freedom of four additional parameters, \u03b2T , \u03b20 , \u03b2\u03c0 , and \u03baT ,\nsince only the combination \u03b1T \u2212 \u03baT is restricted by (66) and (67).\nHence, there seems to be no pure infrared solution to the system in this truncation\nin a self-consistent manner at s = 3. Introduction of additional vertex tensor structures\nor relaxing some assumptions may be sufficient, but this is currently unclear.\nFinally, note that if one accepted a non-self-consistency in the vertex ans\u00e4tze, there\nwould be solutions with \u03baV = 1 for appropriate different choices of the exponents \u03b1T in\n(66) and (67) and of the other exponents in (69). In this case, even a bare ghost-gluon\nvertex would be permitted.\nThe situation in three dimensions, s = 2, is again different. There is still no solution\nfor \u03baV \u2264 1/2. However, for \u03baV > 1/2, there is a solution, with \u03ba\u2206 starting to grow\nfrom zero at \u03baV = 1/2. By adjusting \u03b1T appropriately, it is then possible to have a\nvanishing gluon propagator even at \u03baV only marginally greater than 1/2. In addition,\nthe equation (69) is then easily solved, if h is positive for some set of the parameters,\nwhich can be be achieved even at \u03b2T = \u03b2\u03c0 = \u03b20 = 0. However, a massive gluon is then\nimpossible, as for \u03baT = \u22121 the function h vanishes.\nSo, neither in four nor in three space-time dimensions in this truncation scheme\ndoes the desired solution exist. In three space dimensions no solution exists at all, and\nin two space dimensions only a solution with D00 that is too divergent.\n\n\f21\n\n6 Summary\nIn the present work we have studied the infrared limit of the DSEs in the first-order formalism of Coulomb-gauge Yang-Mills theory. Our truncation was based on the assumption of dominance by the instantaneous contributions. However, it turned out that, even\ntaking into account a certain class of non-trivial vertices, no solution was found which\ndirectly exhibited the desired linear rising Coulomb string tension. However, once this\ncondition is relaxed, solutions can be found. At non-vanishing temperatures it is quite\nreasonable to alleviate some of the conditions, corresponding approaches are discussed\nin [33].\nWe also think that the BRST-type on-shell operator r introduced in section 2 may\nbe useful in future studies of the Coulomb gauge.\nThe results presented here will be useful in constructing other truncation schemes,\nwhich may be better able to capture the infrared dynamics in this formalism. From\nour discussions it has become clear that such a truncation scheme has to go beyond\nthe instantaneous approximation. This then also constitutes the main result of our\ninvestigation.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is dedicated to Prof. Willibald Plessas on the occasion of his 60th birthday.\nWe are grateful to Peter Watson for a critical reading of the manuscript and helpful\ncomments.\nThis work was supported by the FWF under grant numbers P20330 and M1099-N16\nand by the DFG under grant number Ma 3935/1-1 and Ma 3935/1-2 (AM).\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n\nV.
