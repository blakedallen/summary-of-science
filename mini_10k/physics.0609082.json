The latter include autocovariance (AcF) and autocorrelation functions, and the mean square increment (also\nstructure) function. Among the monographs we are aware of, a good exception is [1], where\nan estimate of the two-dimensional AcF is discussed in some detail. Specifically, for a given\nN1 \u00d7 N2 matrix of real data fx1 x2 , x1 = 1, 2, . . . N1 , x2 = 1, 2, . . . N2 , the autocovariance\nfunction is estimated in volume 2, chapter 9 of [1] by\nNX\n1 \u2212u1 NX\n2 \u2212u2\n1\nA\u2217 (~u) =\nf\u02c6x ,x f\u02c6x +u ,x +u ,\n(1)\nN1 N2 x =1 x =1 1 2 1 1 2 2\n1\n2\n\u0001\nwhere ~u = (u1 , u2), f\u02c6x1 x2 = fx1 x2 \u2212 f \u0304 with f \u0304 denoting the sample mean, f \u0304 =\nP 1 PN2\n(1/N1 N2 ) N\nx2 =1 fx1 x2 . The expression is valid for 0 \u2264 u1 \u2264 N1 \u22121 and 0 \u2264 u2 \u2264 N2 \u22121\nx1 =1\n\nand is extended to the third quadrant using the AcF property of being even function. Formally, the latter replaces u1 and u2 in (1) by their absolute values. Note that this leaves\nA\u2217 (~u) undefined in the second and the fourth quadrants. We shall call this estimate \"the\nstandard\" 2d sample autocovariance function (SAcF) estimate.\nFor a homogeneous (stationary) random 2d field, f (~x), the spectral representation theo-\n\nrem asserts that its AcF and spectral density function (or simply the spectrum) are related\nby the Fourier transform,\nS(~k) =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132 X\n+\u221e\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nx1 =\u2212\u221e x2 =\u2212\u221e\n\n~\n\nA(~x)ei~x*k ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ~k = (k1 , k2 ). We use calligraphic letters to distinguish the \"true\" spectra and AcFs\nfrom their estimates. The inverse transform of (2) reads:\nZ \u03c0Z \u03c0\n~\nA(~x) =\nS(~k)e\u2212i~x*k d2 k.\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nEquations (2) and (3) apply to a random field, which depends on discretely valued vector\n\nvariable. It is desirable to have estimates that are also related by a (discrete and finite)\nFourier transform. The simplest direct estimate of the spectrum is provided by the periodogram\nI(~k) =\n\nN\nN\n1 \u22121\n2 \u22121\nX\nX\n1\n~\nf\u02c6x1 x2 f\u02c6y1 y2 e\u2212ik*(~x\u2212~y) .\n2\n(2\u03c0) N1 N2 x ,y =1 x ,y =1\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe periodogram, referred to as \"raw\" (unsmoothed) estimate, is a basis for variety of more\nsophisticated spectral estimates. Hence, in accordance with (3), we would like to have an\nAcF direct estimate, which for all 0 \u2264 |u1 | \u2264 N1 \u2212 1 and 0 \u2264 |u2 | \u2264 N2 \u2212 1 satisfies\nZ \u03c0Z \u03c0\n~\nA(~u) =\nI(~k)e\u2212ik*~u d2 k.\n\u2212\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nThe standard estimate, A\u2217 , satisfies (5), in the domains where it is defined. However, it is\neasy to see that if the validity of (1) is extended to the second and the fourth quadrants,\nEq. (5) does not hold. The latter follows also from the developments presented in the next\nsection.\nAnother property of the theoretical AcF that must be shared by an estimate is the\nproperty of positive semidefiniteness. Let ax1 ,x2 be an arbitrary non-zero (N1 \u00d7 N2 ) matrix\nof real numbers. Then the AcF of a 2d stationary field satisfies\nN1\nX\n\nN2\nX\n\nx1 ,y1 =1 x2 ,y2 =1\n\nax1 ,x2 ay1 ,y2 A (x1 \u2212 y1 , x2 \u2212 y2 ) \u2265 0.\n\n(6)\n\nIt easy to see that A\u2217 does not satisfy (6) in the second and the fourth quadrants. We stress\nthat the inequality (6) does not bear theoretical importance only; it ensures the positiveness\nof spectral estimates based on an AcF estimate (indirect estimates) [2], see also Eq. (9)\nbelow.\nIn this paper we obtain a 2d AcF direct estimate, denoted hereinafter by A(~u), which\nsatisfies (5) in all four quadrants, see the next section \u2013 Eq. (8). The estimate is identical to\nA\u2217 (~u) in the first and the third quadrants but differs in the second and the fourth quadrants.\nThe estimate A(~u) is positive semidefinite and leads to new estimates of both the mean\nsquare increment (structure) function and the power spectrum. We briefly discuss these\nestimates also in the second section and provide generalization of (8) for arbitrary dimension.\nOne of the most important advantages of the new estimate lays in the fact that it is capable to capture the anisotropy of the data in arbitrary spatial direction. The latter dictates\nthe choice of the illustrations and applications we consider here; yet another application -\na study of an YBCO thin film morphology using (8) - can be found in [3]. In the first\nof the two applications, we study the AcF of images representing the morphology of the\nCrab nebula. The random field for these images is the light intensity in a recorded pixel.\nThe anisotropy in this case is determined either by the direction of the expansion of the\nsupernova ejecta or by the interaction of synchrotron nebula with the ejecta [4, 5].\n3\n\n\fIn the third section we compute the covariance of A(~u) for dimension d = 2 and under\nthe simplifying assumptions that the observations are drawn from a Gaussian random field\nand are already adjusted to have zero mean. Our second application involves the anisotropic\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (AKPZ) equation [6, 7, 8], considered in section four in somewhat more\ndetail. The equation pertains to growth of vicinal surfaces and the anisotropy arises from\nthe different rates of growth along and across the average steps direction [6]. We study\nhow this anisotropy imprints on the shape of the AcF by numerically solving the AKPZ\nequation on a large lattice and then taking a smaller size images rotated on various angles\nwith respect to the axis of anisotropy. A summary of our results and main conclusions are\npresented in the last section.\n\nII.\n\nSAMPLE ESTIMATES OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ACF\n\nIn order to obtain a direct estimate of the 2d sample AcF that corresponds to I(~k),\nwe simply need to rearrange (4) to a 2d discrete Fourier transform. We begin by changing y1 = x1 \u2212 u1 and reversing the order of x1 and u1 summation. This breaks up\nPN1 Px1 \u2212N1\nPN1 PN1\nthe sums with respect to x1 , y1 to two double sums:\nu1 =x1\u22121 =\ny1 =1 =\nx1 =1\nx1 =1\nPN1 +u1\nPN1 \u22121 PN1\nP0\n+\nx1 =1+u1 . Next, we shift the summation x1 7\u2192 x1 + u1 in\nx1 =1\nu1 =1\nu1 =\u2212(N1\u22121)\nthe second term only obtaining the intermediate result:\n\nN2\nX\n1\nI(~k) =\n(2\u03c0)2 N1 N2 x ,y =1\n2\n\n2\n\n(\n+\n\nN1 \u2212|u1 |\n\n0\nX\n\nX\n\nf\u02c6x1 ,x2 f\u02c6x1 +|u1 |,y2 e\u2212i[k1 u1 +k2 (x2 \u2212y2 )]\n\nu1 =\u2212(N1\u22121) x1 =1\n\u2212|u1 |\nN\n1 \u22121 N1\nX\nX\nu1 =1\n\n)\n\nf\u02c6x1 +|u1 |,x2 f\u02c6x1 ,y2 e\u2212i[k1 u1 +k2 (x2 \u2212y2 )] .\n\nx1 =1\n\nIn analogous manner we deal with the x2 , and y2 summations obtaining four terms, which\nthen can be combined into two pairs arriving at the following 2d discrete Fourier representation of the periodogram\nI(~k) =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nN\n1 \u22121\nX\n\nN\n2 \u22121\nX\n\nu1 =\u2212N1 +1 u2 =\u2212N2 +1\n\n4\n\n~\n\nA(~u) e\u2212ik*~u .\n\n(7)\n\n\fIn (7), we introduced the function\n\nA(~u) =\n\n\uf8f1\nN1 \u2212|u1 | N2 \u2212|u2 |\n\uf8f4\nX X\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nf\u02c6x1 ,x2 f\u02c6x1 +|u1 |,x2+|u2 |\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 N1 N2\nx =1\nx =1\n1\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n1\nN1 N2\n\n2\n\nfor u1 * u2 \u2265 0\n\nN1 \u2212|u1 | N2 \u2212|u2 |\n\nX\n\nx1 =1\n\nX\n\nf\u02c6x1 ,x2 +|u2 | f\u02c6x1 +|u1 |,x2\n\nx2 =1\n\n(8)\n\nfor u1 * u2 < 0,\n\nwhich represents the new estimate of the sample AcF in dimension two. It differs from the\nstandard estimate (1) in the second and fourth quadrants only. We stress that by the virtue\nof its construction, it is (8) but not the standard estimate that is related to the periodogram\nby (7).\nA different way to obtain A(~u) is to substitute I(~k) directly in Eq. (5) and perform the\nintegration with respect to ~k. Then to use the obtained pair of Kronecker symbols to carry\nout two of the summations carefully accounting for the limits of summation. The latter\ndepends on the position of ~u, which produces (8).\nThe estimate A(~u) is positive semidefinite function. This follows from the way it was\nobtained but it is instructive to show that the positive semidefiniteness virtually forces the\nform of the SAcF, Eq. (8). To demonstrate this we use a 2d generalization of a proof of\nsemidefiniteness due to McLeod and Jim\u00e9nez, see [2], chapter 6. Let \u03b5x1 ,x2 be a 2d white noise\nP 1 PN2 \u02c6\nwith zero mean and variance 1/N1N2 . Form a the field gx1 ,x2 = N\nl=1 fk,l \u03b5x1 \u2212k,x2 \u2212l ; here\nk=1\nthe centered values of the sample, f\u02c6k,l , are considered as coefficients of a moving averagelike 2d field. Since gx1 ,x2 is stationary, its theoretical AcF must be positive semidefinite.\nA straightforward calculation shows that this function is given by (8). One last remark\nregarding (8): it easy to see that the estimate A(~u) can be computed numerically using\nthe FFT-based algorithm and the codes given in [9], chapters 12 and 13; however, by first\nextending the data twice in both dimensions and assuming that fx1 ,x2 \u2261 0 if either N1 \u2264\nx1 \u2264 2N1 , or N2 \u2264 x2 \u2264 2N2 (double length zero padding).\nEstimate (8) can be used as a basis for estimates of both sample power spectrum and\nsample mean square increment function. One can obtain an estimate of the spectrum from\n(8) by employing it in a 2d generalization of Grenander and Rosenblatt formula [10],\nS(~k) =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nN\n1 \u22121\nX\n\nN\n2 \u22121\nX\n\nu1 =\u2212N1 +1 u2 =\u2212N2 +1\n\n5\n\n~\n\nw(~u)A(~u)e\u2212ik*~u ,\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere the function w(~u) is termed \"lag window\". The general properties and specific examples of w(~u) can be found in [1]; we note here that obviously it must be an even function\nw(\u2212~u) = w(~u). The statistics of this estimate will be presented elsewhere, note however that\nas in the 1d case, (5) provides a smoothed compared to the \"raw\" periodogram estimate.\nThe mean square increment (structure) function of f (~x), B(~u), is defined [11, 12] by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nB(~u) = E (f (~x + ~u) \u2212 f (~x))2 , where E denotes the ensemble averaging, and is related\n\nto the AcF by B(~u) = 2 (A(0) \u2212 A(~u)), e.g. [13]; for an estimate that corresponds to the\nstandard estimate of A(~u) see [14, 15]. An estimate corresponding to (8) should be modified\nin the second and the fourth quadrants as:\nN1 \u2212|u1 | N2 \u2212|u2 |\nX X\n\u00012\n1\nB(~u) =\nfx1 ,x2 +|u2 | \u2212 fx1 +|u1 |,x2 ,\nN1 N2 x =1 x =1\n1\n\n2\n\nfor u1 * u2 < 0.\n\n(10)\n\nIn addition of being a positive function, we remark that B(~u) does not involve the sample\nmean of f (~x) and thus is free from a source of bias brought up by f [2, 16]. Modifications\nanalogous to (10) are apparently due for the estimates of the generalized structure functions\nused to infer multifractal scaling, see Refs. [17, 18].\nEstimate (8) can readily be generalized to arbitrary dimension d. To shorten the notations, consider a multi-index with d components p = (p1 , p1 , . . . pd ) each taking a value of\neither 0 or 1. Let pk = 0 indicates xk , whereas pk = 1 indicates xk + |uk |, k = 1, 2, . . . d, and\nlet p designate the multi-index whose components are all different from the components of p;\ne.g. if p = (011), then p = (100). Then the d-dimensional SAcF estimate can be expressed\nas\n\nN1 \u2212|u1 |\nNd \u2212|ud |\nX\nX\n1\n***\nf\u02c6p f\u02c6p ,\nAp (~u) =\nN1 N2 . . . Nd x =1\nx =1\n1\n\n(11)\n\nd\n\nwhere p = (0, 0, . . . , 0) pertains to the first and the 2d\u22121 + 1-th hyperquadrants, p =\n(0, 0, . . . , 1) to the second and 2d\u22121 + 2-th hyperquadrants, and so on. In general, the\nSAcF in hyperquadrants k and 2d\u22121 + k is expressed by (11) with a multi-index p, which is\nthe binary representation of number k \u2212 1.\nTo illustrate the difference between the standard and the estimate (8), we provide plots\nof both estimates for pair of images representing regions of the Crab nebula. The images\nwere selected from a color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) [19]. The\ncolor image was created as a weighted sum of three narrowband filters centered at 5012\n\u00c5, 6306 \u00c5 and 6732 \u00c5 and comprises 24 individual Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2\n6\n\n\fexposures [4]. We converted the color image into gray scale (in the range of 0-256) image,\ni.e. fx,y in this case is proportional to the light intensity per pixel and represents the\nmorphology of the nebula; we added a circle indicating the position of the Crab pulsar.\nThe first of the selected images, shown in Fig. 1(b) top panel, is located close to outer\nrim of the nebula dominated by the expanding ejecta [4, 5]. The coordinates of its right\nbottom corner are, RA: \u03b12000 =5:34:40.5 and Dec: \u03b42000 =21:59:39.1. The image extends\n(46.2\u00d749.7) arcseconds corresponding to (N1 = 453) \u00d7 (N2 = 487) pixels. By just inspecting\nthe image the anisotropy is not easily recognizable, however, due to the outward expansion\nof the supernova remnant an anisotropy roughly across the radial direction (direction to the\npulsar) should present in the morphology.\nThe second image has coordinates: \u03b12000 =5:34:29.0, \u03b42000 = 21:59:10.0 and extends\n51.8\u00d751.8 arcseconds, (504 \u00d7 504) pixels - Fig. 1(b), bottom panel. It is from a region\nwhere the synchrotron nebula (upper left sector of the image) interacts with the denser\nejecta creating \"filaments\". The latter are attributed to a magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T)\ninstabilities [4]. The major axis of anisotropy in this region should, in general, be expected\nalong rather then across the direction to the pulsar.\nAn overall linear (planar) trend, g = s\u03b1 \u03b1 + s\u03b4 \u03b4 with origins of coordinate systems at the\nleft-upper corners of the images, is removed before both SAcF estimates were computed.\nCarrying out this procedure is important since the trend by itself produces anisotropy in\nthe SAcF. In the case of images presented in Fig. 1(b) the linear trend is rather small;\nthe estimated slopes (in units grayscale/pixel) are sDEC = \u22120.027, sRA = 0.0071, and\nsDEC = 0.101, sRA = 0.031, for first and second images, respectively. The standard and the\nestimate (8) for the first image are presented as gray scale plots with superimposed level\ncontours in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d), respectively. For the sake of completeness of the plot the\nstandard AcF is extended to the second and the fourth quadrants, hence the specific \"rose\"\nappearance of the AcF. The anisotropy of the supernova remnant structures in this part\nof the nebula is clearly recognized from the plot of A(~u) with the major axis of anisotropy\nhaving an angle of about \u03b8 \u2248 \u221225\u25e6 with respect to the horizontal axis. This angle should be\ninterpreted as the average front of the local expansion, refer to Fig. 1(a). Another quantity\nthat characterizes the anisotropy is the aspect ratio, \u03b3, the ratio between the characteristic\nsizes of the nebula structures along the minor and majors axes of anisotropy. The latter\nsizes are defined by the correlation lengths of SAcF in the respective directions. We evaluate\n7\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f )\n\nFIG. 1: Standard AcF estimate and estimate (8) for two regions of the Crab nebula. Panel (a)\nshows the location of the regions; the circle indicates the position of the pulsar. Panel (b) shows\nthe two regions zoomed by an identical factor. Panels (c) and (d) show the standard AcF estimate\nand the estimate (8), respectively for the upper image in (b). Panels (e) and (f) \u2013 the same the\nbottom image in (b). The morphology principle axes of anisotropy are drawn in plates (d) and (f).\n\n8\n\n\fthese lengths crudely by assuming, somewhat arbitrary, that the 1d principal profiles of AcF\nare represented by random processes with finite domain (band-limited) spectra. Using the\nexpressions for the correlation length obtained for this class of random processes in [20, 21],\nwe infer \u03b3 \u2248 0.57.\n\nFor the second region, the major axis of the anisotropy is at angle of \u03b8 \u2248 \u221259.5\u25e6 with\n\nrespect to the horizontal axis, which as should be expected is roughly in direction to the\npulsar, refer to Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(f). The aspect ratio in this case is \u03b3 \u2248 0.875.\nIII.\n\nCOVARIANCES OF THE 2D SAMPLE AUTOCOVARIANCE FUNCTION\n\nIn this section we obtain expression for covariances of 2d SAcF - the estimate (8),\nevaluated at two points ~u = (u1 , u2) and ~v = (v1 , v2 ):\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\ncov A(~u), A(~v) = E A(~u)A(~v ) \u2212 E A(~u) E A(~v ) .\n\n(12)\n\nThe covariance has both theoretical as well as practical importance for determining the\nconfidence intervals in the AcF estimate. The expression will be derived under the simplifying assumptions that fx1 ,x2 is a Gaussian random field with zero mean (or that the mean\nis known and subtracted). It is immediately seen that irrespective to which quadrant ~u\nbelongs,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n|u1 |\n|u2 |\nE A(~u) = 1 \u2212\n1\u2212\nA(~u),\nN1\nN2\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\n(13)\n\nwhere as before A(~u) denotes the true autocovariance function of f (~x). Eq. (13) is identical\nto the ensemble average of the standard estimate and shows that (8) is a biased estimate.\nThe bias, however, is small for large samples especially for small |~u|. We turn now to the first\nterm in (12). Reckoning with A(\u2212~u) = A(~u) and the symmetry under the exchange ~u \u2194 ~v,\nwe need to consider three different cases only: (i) ~u \u2208 I quadrant, ~v \u2208 I quadrant; (ii) ~u \u2208\nII quadrant, ~v \u2208 II quadrant; and (iii) ~u \u2208 I quadrant, ~v \u2208 II quadrant. The calculations in\nall three cases are closely similar; below we illustrate them for the case (ii) only. Inserting\nthe pertinent for this case AcF expressions from (8) and using that for a Gaussian field the\nfour-point function can be expressed as combinations of products of two two-point AcFs we\nhave\n\n9\n\n\fN1 \u2212|u1 | N2 \u2212|u2 | N1 \u2212|v1 | N2 \u2212|v2 | h\nX X X X\n1\nA(|u1|, \u2212|u2|)A(|v1 |, \u2212|v2 |)\nN12 N22 x =1 x =1 y =1 y =1\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE A(~u)A(~v ) =\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n+A(y1 \u2212x1 , y2 \u2212x2 +|v2|\u2212|u2|)A(y1 \u2212x1 +|v1 |\u2212|u1|, y2 \u2212x2 )\n\ni\n+A(y1 \u2212x1 +|v1|, y2 \u2212x2 \u2212|u2|)A(y1 \u2212x1 \u2212|u1 |, y2 \u2212x2 +|v2 |) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe first of these terms does not depends of the summation indexes and cancels out with\nthe second term in (12) exactly, refer to (13). In the remaining two terms we perform the\nindicated change p~ = ~y \u2212 ~x and again reverse the order of the summation. This allows to\ncarry out the summations with respect to both x1 and x2 explicitly, noting in the process\nthat we need to distinguish the case |u1 | > |v1 | from the case |v1 | > |u1 |. The result is a\nproduct of two trapezium shaped functions, which involve two parameters, c and d,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n0,\np \u2264 \u2212(1 \u2212 c)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 \u2212 c + p, \u2212(1 \u2212 c) \u2264 p \u2264 \u2212d\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nW (c, d; p) := 1 \u2212 c \u2212 d,\n\u2212d \u2264 p \u2264 d\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1 \u2212 c \u2212 p,\nd \u2264p\u2264 1 \u2212 c\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\n1 \u2212 c \u2264p,\n\n(15)\n\nsee also Fig. 2. The parameters c and d are subject to the conditions 0 \u2264 d \u2264 1 \u2212 c \u2264 1.\nNext, introducing ~a := (~u + ~v)/2; ~b := (~u \u2212 ~v )/2 and shifting the summation indexes\np1 and p2 simultaneously according to ~p = (q1 \u2212 u1 \u2212 N1 , q2 + u2 \u2212 N2 ), we arrive at the\nfollowing expression for the covariance valid when both ~u and ~v are in the second quadrant:\n\nh\ni\ncov A(~u), A(~v) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n2N1X\n+2a1 \u22121 2N2X\n\u22122a2 \u22121\na1 |b1 | r1\na2 |b2 | r2\n1\nW \u2212 ,\nW\n;\n,\n;\nN1 N2 q =1\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\nq2 =1\n1\nh\ni\n\u00d7 A(~r + ~a) A(~r \u2212 ~a) + A(~r + ~b) A(~r \u2212 ~b) ,\n(16)\n\nwhere ~r = (q1 \u2212 a1 \u2212 N1 , q2 + a2 \u2212 N2 ) has been introduced.\nSimilar expressions are obtained in cases (i) and (iii) above. Finally, if we define e\na1,2 :=\n(|u1,2| + |v1,2 |)/2 and eb1,2 := (|u1,2| \u2212 |v1,2 |)/2, all three cases can be combined into the\n\nfollowing compact form:\n\n10\n\n\fW(c,d; p)\n\n1\n\n1-c-d\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n-d\n\n-(1-c)\n\nd\n\n1-c\n\n1\n\np\n\nFIG. 2: Graph of the window function W (c, d; p), Eq.

This expression is valid for\n\narbitrary positions of vectors ~u and ~v .\n\nThe important for the practice variances of the SAcF, can be obtained from the expres-\n\nsions of the covariance.

Adatoms that migrate towards the\nsteps and attach to them, have lower probability to desorb compared to those migrating\nparallel to the steps. This effectively induces different rates of growth along and across the\nsteps and violates the rotational symmetry of the KPZ growth process [22]. Let h = h(~x, t)\nbe the height of the growing surface at point ~x = (x, y) and time t. If one chooses the\nx-coordinate along the direction of the steps, the AKPZ equation takes the form:\n\u2202t h = \u03bdx \u2202x2 h + \u03bdy \u2202y2 h +\n\n\u03bbx\n\u03bby\n(\u2202x h)2 +\n(\u2202y h)2 + \u03b7,\n2\n2\n\n(19)\n\nsee also [8]. In this equation: \u03bdx and \u03bdy are coefficients of the curvature terms associated\nwith desorption, \u03bbx and \u03bby are coefficients related to growth rates normal the surface, and\n\u03b7 = \u03b7(x, y, t) is a Gaussian white noise, E[\u03b7(x, y, t)\u03b7(x\u2032 , y \u2032, t\u2032 )] = 2D\u03b4(x\u2212x\u2032 )\u03b4(y \u2212y \u2032)\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032 ).\nThe equation has been studied by D. E. Wolf using one-loop, renormalization-group (RG)\napproximation [7]. Some of the obtained results have later been confirmed by numerical\nsimulations [23]. To recap what will be needed here, let r\u03bd = \u03bdy /\u03bdx and r\u03bb = \u03bby /\u03bbx and let\nboth \u03bbx and \u03bby be positive. In this case the AKPZ surface grows with an exponent identical\nto the surface generated by the isotropic KPZ equation, referred to as algebraic roughness.\nAs the morphology evolves, the nonlinear parameters \u03bbx and \u03bby , as in the case of isotropic\nKPZ are not renormalized, whereas \u03bdx and \u03bdy take effective values such that r\u03bd = r\u03bb (a fixed\npoint to the dynamical renormalization flow equations) [7]. This means that in this case the\nanisotropy of the surface is of the simplest kind \u2013 elliptical anisotropy \u2013 and therefore might\nbe taken as a benchmark for testing statistical methods characterizing anisotropy.\nThe numerical simulations were carried out using the Amar and Family numerical\nscheme [24, 25, 26], which broadly speaking includes rescaling of the equation and employing the standard discretization for the derivatives. Two comments are in order. First,\nin contrast to [23], we choose rescaling that leaves the equation manifestly anisotropic:\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n7\nx 7\u2192 \u03bdx x, y \u2192\n\u03bdx y, h 7\u2192 (2\u03bdx /\u03bbx )h, and \u03b7 7\u2192 2D/\u03bdx \u03b7. Second, the discrete analog\ndoes not adequately represent the continuous AKPZ equation [27], however, since more accurate difference scheme are not known for dimensions higher than one [28, 29], we employ\nhere the standard discretization. What is more important within the scope of this study,\n12\n\n\fFIG. 3: Gray scale image of a morphology obtained by numerically solving the anisotropic KPZ\nequation. The image represents the central (512\u00d7512) part from the entire (1024\u00d71024) simulated\nsurface. The conditions at which the simulation is carried out are discussed in the text.\n\nthe discrete equation inherits the elliptical anisotropy of the original AKPZ equation.\nThe elliptical anisotropy can be discerned even by visually inspecting of the simulated\nmorphology, see Fig. 3. The picture represents AKPZ surface generated with parameters\n\u03bdx = 1, \u03bdy = 0.3, \u03bbx = 10, \u03bby = 3, and D = 0.2; (to skip the \"transient\" time for the system\nto come to the RG fixed point, we have chosen r\u03bd = r\u03bb = 0.3 at the outset). The simulation\nis carried out on a square lattice with side of L = 1024 and for T = 2 \u00d7 105 time steps of\n\u2206t = 0.001. The surface height range is given in units of lattice spacing set to unity.\nIn a typical experimental circumstances, the axes of anisotropy are rarely known and\nneed to be inferred and quantified from a image of the morphology [15]. To reckon with\nthis we \"record\" smaller, (512\u00d7512), images, which are rotated at angles \u03c80 = 0\u25e6 , 10\u25e6 ,\n30\u25e6 , and 60\u25e6 with respect to the x-axis of the simulated surface. The picture in Fig. 3\nrepresents the image for \u03c80 = 0\u25e6 . The images for \u03c80 6= 0\u25e6 are obtained using a simple,\n13\n\n\fFIG. 4: Sample AcF for an image of the AKPZ simulated morphology illustrated in Fig. 3, however\nrotated on angle 30\u25e6 .\n\nbased on the four nearest neighbor points interpolation. Then for every image we compute\nthe AcF estimate (8), an example of which for \u03c80 = 30\u25e6 is shown in Fig. 4. Taking a more\nsystematic approach, rather than the correlation length, we consider sections of AcF defined\nby aA(0) \u2264 A(~u) \u2264 (a+\u2206a)A(0) for several levels 0 < a < 1 and a fixed width of \u2206a = 0.04.\nWe project the values of A(~u) within each section on the (u1 , u2 ) plane and fit these points\nby an ellipse. The direction of the axis of asymmetry and the aspect ratio is evaluated from\nthe parameters of these ellipses. In the actual fits we have used four levels of a: 0.2, 0.4,\n0.6, and 0.8.\nThe obtained results show a discrepancy typically within \u00b12\u25e6 from the expected direction\nof the anisotropy. In few cases only, all associated with the lowest level of a, the discrepancy\nis up to \u00b14\u25e6 . More interesting are the inferred values of the aspect ratio. These are plotted in\nFig. 5 for all four angles of rotation and AcF levels a and for two simulated surfaces, studied\nindependently.

To understand\nthis, we rescale (19) in a manner different from the one used prior to numerical integration;\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1/4 1/4 e\n1/4 1/4\ne, y = \u03bdy ye, h =\n\u03b7 , arriving\nh, and \u03b7 = ( 2D/\u03bdx \u03bdy )e\nnamely, x = \u03bdx x\n2D/\u03bdx \u03bdy\n\nat\n\n\u03b5x \u0010 e \u00112 \u03b5y \u0010 e \u00112\n\u2202xe h +\n\u2202yeh + \u03b7e.\n\u2202te\nh = \u2202xe2e\nh + \u2202ye2e\nh+\n(20)\n2\n2\n\u221a\n3/2 1/4\nIn the above equation, \u03b5x = \u03bbx 2D/\u03bdx r\u03bd and \u03b5y = (r\u03bb /r\u03bd ) \u03b5x and hence at the fixed point\nof the RG, Eq. (20) is equivalent to the isotopic KPZ equation. Therefore, the anisotropic\n15\n\n\fsurface in this case is obtained by just rescaling the isotropic surface in x and y directions\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nby lx = \u03bdx and ly = \u03bdy , respectively. The latter leads to aspect ratio of \u03b3 = r\u03bd ,\nwhich as demonstrated in Fig. 5 is imprinted in the sample AcF, Eq. (8). A somewhat\n\u221a\nlarger discrepancy from r\u03bd observed at the lowest level fits can be attributed to a greater\nrelative variability of the SAcF. The latter can be estimated crudely from the variance\n(18) by substituting the SAcF for the unknown true AcF. For the two simulations used in\nFig. 5, we obtain an increase from 12% at ~u = 0, up to about 23% for points ~u at which\nA(~u) = 0.2A(0). As a final remark, the one-loop RG approximation of the AKPZ equation\nindicates that if \u03bby 6= 0 the surfaces in this class are characterized by two characteristic\nlengths, lx and ly , even when the morphology has not yet evolved to the RG fixed point.\nIn addition, the characteristic length scale linearly, ly \u223c lx , Ref. [7]. This suggests that the\napproach undertaken in this section may be suitable for characterization of more generic\nAKPZ morphologies. Further numerical simulations, however, are needed to confirm this\nassertion.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have suggested an estimate for the autocovariance function (AcF) of a\nhomogenous random field in arbitrary dimension d. The estimate, Eq. (11), is constructed\nas to represent the discrete and finite Fourier transform of the periodogram estimate of the\nfield's power spectrum; it is identical to the standard AcF estimate in the first and the\n2d\u22121 + 1-th quadrants but differs in all other quadrants. As it should be, the estimate is\npositive semidefinite. On the basis of (11), we have suggested new estimates for the field's\nstructure function and power spectrum. We have also derived expressions for the covariance,\nconsequently for the variance of the AcF estimate in two dimensions under the simplifying\nassumption that the field is Gaussian and with a known mean.\nPerhaps the most important advantage of the new sample AcF over the standard estimate\nlays in the fact that it captures the anisotropy of the field in all spatial directions. The latter\nis demonstrated on two examples. The first involves the morphology of the Grab nebula\nobserved by the Hubble space telescope. For sake of comparison we presented plots of\nthe standard AcF as well. The second example involves surfaces simulated by numerically\nsolving the anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (AKPZ) equation and is considered in more\n16\n\n\fdetail. In particular, we have focused on the case \u03bdy /\u03bdx = \u03bby /\u03bbx , i.e. when the system is at\na fixed point of the dynamic renormalization group approximation for the AKPZ equation.\nIn this case the characteristic lengths of the morphology are two and are determined by\n\u221a\n\u221a\nlx = \u03bdx and ly = \u03bdy . Hence, the surface can be viewed as a simple benchmark for testing\nstatistical methods that account for anisotropy. We have shown that one can retrieve both\nthe direction and the aspect ratio of the anisotropy reasonably well from the estimate (11) in\ntwo dimensions. This has been done on several sections of the AcF and on two independent\nrealizations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank S. Zhekov for valuable comments and suggestions, Tz.
