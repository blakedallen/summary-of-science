The abundance of massive clusters depends\nexponentially on this parameter (assuming Gaussian initial fluctuations), because a high amplitude of mass fluctuations forms structure rapidly at early times, while a lower amplitude\nforms structure more slowly. The most massive systems (\u223c 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 ), which take the\nlongest time to form and grow, did not exist at early times if the initial amplitude of mass\nfluctuations is low, but rather formed only recently.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nThe amplitude parameter, denoted \u03c38 when referring to the rms linear density fluctuation in spheres of radius 8h\u22121 Mpc at z = 0, is not easily determined since the mass\ndistribution cannot be directly observed. As a result, this parameter is not yet accurately\nknown. Recent observations suggest an amplitude that ranges in value from \u03c38 \u223c 0.7 to a\n'high' value of \u03c38 \u223c 0.9 \u2212 1. While the difference in the reported values is only around 50%,\nthe impact on structure formation and evolution is much larger, since the latter depends\nexponentially on \u03c382 . The low amplitude values are suggested by current observations of the\nCMB spectrum of fluctuations (Netterfield et al. 2002; Sievers et al. 2002; Bond et al. 2002;\nRuhl et al. 2002). However, this \u03c38 determination is degenerate with the unknown optical\ndepth at reionization: if the optical depth were underestimated, then \u03c38 would be as well1 .\nRecent observations of the present-day cluster abundance as well as cosmic shear lensing\nmeasurements have also suggested that \u03c38 \u223c 0.7 (e.g. Jarvis et al. 2003; Hamana et al. 2002;\nSeljak 2001). However, these measures provide a degenerate relation between the amplitude\n\u03c38 and the mass-density parameter \u03a9m : \u03c38 \u03a90.6\nm \u2248 0.33 (Ikebe et al. 2002; Bahcall et al.\n2003; Jarvis et al. 2003; Seljak 2001). The amplitude \u03c38 \u223c 0.7 is implied only if \u03a9m \u223c 0.3.\nIf \u03a9m \u223c 0.2, as is suggested by some observations (e.g. Carlberg, Yee & Ellingson 1997;\nBahcall & Fan 1998; Bahcall et al. 2000; Wilson, et al. 2001; Ikebe et al. 2002; Reiprich &\nBohringer 2002), then the amplitude is \u03c38 \u223c 0.9 \u2212 1. Early results from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) cluster data (Bahcall et al. 2003) use the shape of the observed cluster\nmass function to break the degeneracy between the parameters and find \u03c38 = 0.9+0.3\n\u22120.2 and\n+0.08\n\u03a9m = 0.19\u22120.07 . Similar results have recently been obtained from the temperature function\nof a large sample of X-ray clusters (Ikebe et al. 2002; Reiprich & Bohringer 2002). Most of\nthe recent cluster normalization observations, as well as cosmic shear lensing measurements\nsuggest \u03c38 \u2243 0.9 \u2212 1 if \u03a9m \u2243 0.2 (Jarvis et al. 2003; Hamana et al. 2002, and the references\nabove). Combining current CMB measurements with the SDSS cluster mass function yields\nintermediate values of \u03c38 = 0.76 \u00b1 0.09 and \u03a9m = 0.26+0.06\n\u22120.07 (Melchiorri et al. 2003).\nThe evolution of cluster abundance with time, especially for the most massive clusters,\nbreaks the degeneracy between \u03c38 and \u03a9m (e.g. Peebles, Daly & Juszkiewicz 1989; Eke, Cole\n& Frenk 1996; Oukbir & Blanchard 1997; Bahcall, Fan, & Cen 1997; Carlberg et al. 1997;\nBahcall & Fan 1998; Donahue & Voit 1999; Henry 2000). This evolution depends strongly\non \u03c38 , and only weakly on \u03a9m or other parameters. The expected abundance of massive\nclusters at z \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1 differs between Gaussian models with \u03c38 = 0.6 and \u03c38 = 1 by ordersof-magnitude, nearly independently of other parameters (Fan, Bahcall & Cen 1997, e.g.).\nTherefore, this method provides a uniquely powerful tool in estimating the amplitude \u03c38 .\n1\n\nSee note at end of paper\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIn this paper we use the abundance of the most massive clusters observed at z \u223c 0.5\u22120.8\nto place a strong limit on \u03c38 .\n\n2.\n\nThe Evolution of Cluster Abundance\n\nA flat \u03a9m = 0.3 cold-dark-matter universe (LCDM) with \u03c38 = 0.6 predicts \u223c 103\nfewer massive clusters (with mass \u223c 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) at z \u2248 0.8 than a universe with \u03c38 = 1\n(e.g. Bahcall & Fan 1998; Bode et al. 2001). We use massive clusters observed at z \u2248 0.5\nand z \u2248 0.8 (as compiled by Bahcall & Fan 1998) to set limits on \u03c38 . These three clusters,\ndetected originally in X-rays by the EMSS survey (Henry et al. 1992; Luppino & Gioia 1995),\nhave masses larger than 8\u00d71014h\u22121 M\u2299 within a radius of 1.5h\u22121 comoving Mpc. The masses\nare determined from gravitational weak lensing observations (for two of the three clusters),\nas well as from the observed temperatures (T &8 Kev) and velocity dispersions (&1200\nKm/s) of the clusters. All clusters have a measured S-Z effect (Grego 2001; Carlstrom\net al. 2001). These clusters have been conservatively selected, with mass measurements\navailable from several independent methods, all yielding consistent results (see Bahcall &\nFan (1998) for details, including the consistency of the mass determinations from different\nmethods, and the relevant abundances at z \u2248 0.6 and 0.8). Since only a threshold cluster\nmass is used in the analysis below (i.e., not individual cluster masses), a conservative mass\nthreshold of 8 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 is used; the clusters are well above this threshold. The resulting\n\u22128 3\n\u22123\n\u22128 3\n\u22123\nabundances are ncl = 1.4+1.1\nat z = 0.5 \u2212 0.65, and 1.4+1.4\n\u22120.9 \u00d7 10 h Mpc\n\u22121.1 \u00d7 10 h Mpc\nat z = 0.65 \u2212 0.9. The error bars represent 68% confidence level assuming Poisson statistics\nand equal likelihood for each log(ncl ). The volume searched and hence the number density\ndepends on the assumed cosmology; these numbers are for an LCDM model with \u03a9m = 0.3.\nFor purposes of comparison, the abundance of massive clusters at z \u2248 0 and at z \u2248 0.38\nis obtained from the temperature function observed by Ikebe et al. (2002) (for z \u2248 0)\nand Henry (2000) (for z \u2248 0.38). Here we convert our threshold mass of 8 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299\n(within 1.5h\u22121 comoving Mpc) to temperature using the mean relation between cluster mass\n(observed directly from weak gravitational lensing) and temperature: M(\u2264 1h\u22121 Mpc) =\n0.95T (kev) 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 (Bahcall & Sette (2002); see also Hjorth, Oukbir & van Kampen\n(1998); Carlberg, Yee & Ellingson (1997)). These observations indicate that cluster masses\ndetermined from lensing are consistent on average with those derived from X-ray temperatures, with an rms scatter of \u223c20%. For the small extrapolation to radius 1.5h\u22121 Mpc\ncomoving, we use the observed cluster profile on these scales: M(< R) \u223c R0.6 (Carlberg, Yee & Ellingson 1997; Fischer & Tyson 1997). This allows us to determine the observed cluster abundance at z \u2243 0 and z \u2243 0.38 for the relevant mass clusters. We find\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u22127 3\n\u22123\n\u22128 3\n\u22123\nncl = 1.1+1.1\nat z = 0.05 (Ikebe et al. 2002) and ncl = 1.7+1.7\n\u22120.7 \u00d7 10 h Mpc\n\u22121.1 \u00d7 10 h Mpc\nat z = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 (Henry 2000); the error bars allow for statistical uncertainty as well as the\nuncertainty in the mass threshold. These numbers assume an \u03a9m = 0.3 LCDM cosmology.\n\nThe observed abundance of these massive clusters as a function of redshift is presented\nin Figure 1. In the next section, we compare the data with semianalytic predictions and\nconstrain the allowed range of parameters. First, we use only the high redshift (z > 0.5)\ncluster abundance (where mass thresholds are determined by multiple methods, as discussed\nabove). Then we take advantage of the full evolution of the abundance, from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 0.8,\nby combining the high-redshift result with the independent z \u2248 0 cluster normalization\nrelation obtained from other studies. We discuss these analyses in the following section.\n\n3.\n\nComparison with Predicted Densities\n\nFor a given cosmological model, the expected cluster mass function can be predicted\nusing recent improvements to the Press-Schechter formalism. We follow the procedure outlined in the Appendix of Hu & Kravtsov (2002). For a given choice of parameters, the linear\nmatter power spectrum is calculated with the publicly available CMBFAST code (Seljak\n& Zaldarriaga 1996). This allows a prediction of the mass function, using a fixed mean\noverdensity as the definition of mass. This mass can then be extrapolated to 1.5 h\u22121 Mpc\ncomoving, assuming an NFW density profile. The analytic predictions were compared to\nthe N-body results of Bode et al. (2001), and the resulting cluster abundances were found\nto agree within 20% out to redshift z = 1.\nThe first result is presented in Figure 1, where we compare the observed cluster abundance as a function of redshift with that expected from LCDM models. Here we use LCDM\nwith the 'concordance' value of \u03a9m = 0.3 (Bahcall et al. 1999, with h = 0.72 and n = 1),\nbut with different amplitudes \u03c38 ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 (bottom to top curves). Comparison of data and models shows that if \u03a9m = 0.3, then \u03c38 has to be relatively high,\n\u03c38 = 0.9 \u00b1 0.1, in order to produce the observed abundance of clusters at all redshifts. Low\nnormalization values of \u03c38 \u2248 0.7- which would be required for \u03a9m = 0.3 by the present-day\ncluster abundance and the cosmic shear lensing measurements discussed in \u00a72- produce an\norder-of-magnitude too few massive clusters as compared with observations at any redshift.\nTherefore, for \u03a9m =0.3, \u03c38 needs to be & 0.9.\nWhat if \u03a9m is not 0.3? How does this affect the allowed range of \u03c38 ? In Figure 2 we\ncompare the data to the cluster evolution expected for \u03c38 = 1.1, 0.9, and 0.7 (top to bottom\nbands), where the width of each band covers all values of \u03a9m from 0.1 to 0.4. It can be seen\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthat the best fit to the data is again \u03c38 \u2243 0.9 \u2212 1. Low values of \u03c38 . 0.7 appear to be\nexcluded by the data, nearly independent of \u03a9m ; they provide significantly fewer high mass\nclusters than observed, especially at z > 0.5. This result is consistent with the independent\n+0.08\nSDSS cluster mass-function at low redshift which yields \u03c38 = 0.9+0.3\n\u22120.2 and \u03a9m = 0.19\u22120.07\n(Bahcall et al. 2003). The independent result obtained here from the high redshift clusters\n(Figures 1-2) provides important confirmation that \u03c38 is indeed high (\u223c 0.9 \u2212 1).\nFinally, we use the observed cluster abundance at high redshifts (z & 0.5), independent\nof the lower redshift points, to determine the best \u03c38 \u2212 \u03a9m normalization relation from high\nredshift clusters. This was done by minimizing \u03c72 , using the error bars given in Bahcall\n& Fan (1998) plus an additional factor of 20% to account for uncertainties in the analytic\nprediction. The allowed 68% and 95% confidence limits are presented by the solid contours\nin Figure 3. As expected, the observed abundance of these massive clusters at high redshift\ndepends mostly on \u03c38 (\u00a72); the dependence on \u03a9m is very weak. (The dependence on other\nparameters - Hubble constant and spectral index \u2013 is also weak, as is discussed below). This\nfact makes the high redshift cluster abundance method a powerful tool in constraining \u03c38 .\nThe results in Figure 3 show that for any observationally acceptable range of \u03a9m , from \u223c 0.1\nto \u223c 0.4, the amplitude remains in the range of \u03c38 \u2243 0.9 \u2212 1. Values of \u03c38 < 0.8 are unlikely;\nthey have too little power to form massive systems at z > 0.5.\nWe use the z = 0.5 \u2212 0.8 clusters to determine the best-fit cluster normalization relation\nfrom the high-redshift objects; we find:\n\u03c38 = 1.03 \u2212 0.3\u03a9m \u00b1 10%\n\u03c38 \u03a90.14\nm\n\n= 0.78 \u00b1 0.08\n\n, or\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\n(where \u03c38 and \u03a9m refer, as before, to their z = 0 value). The linear relation [1a] is within\n3% of the true best-fit \u03c38 over the range \u03a9m = 0.1 \u2212 1.0; the power-law fit [1b] is superior\nto equation [1a] in the range \u03a9m = 0.2 \u2212 0.7. These relations assume a Hubble constant of\nh = 0.72 and spectral index n = 1, but the results are insensitive to reasonable changes in\nh and n. We find that changing h by \u2206h = \u00b10.13, i.e., from h = 0.59 to h = 0.85, changes\n\u03c38 by less than \u00b15% (at a given \u03a9m ); \u03c38 increases slightly with h. Similarly, changing the\nspectral index n = 1 by \u2206n = \u00b10.2, from n = 0.8 to n = 1.2, changes \u03c38 by less than\n\u00b15% (in the same direction: slightly higher \u03c38 for higher n). The 1- and 2-sigma contours\nof the allowed \u03c38 - \u03a9m parameter region that includes both these h and n variations are\npresented by the dotted curves in Figure 3. As expected, these conservative ranges in h\nand n broaden the allowed region. The above results include the estimated uncertainty in\nthe mass threshold for the clusters (Bahcall & Fan 1998). As discussed in \u00a72, only a lower\nthreshold (selected at the lower 1-sigma level of the mass estimates) is used in this analysis,\nnot the individual mass of each cluster. Reducing the cluster mass threshold further by 10%\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwill reduce the amplitude \u03c38 by \u223c10% (Fan, Bahcall & Cen 1997; Bahcall & Fan 1998).\nAlso shown in Figure 3 are the analogous confidence contours from the cluster massfunction normalization at z = 0.1 \u2212 0.2 (Bahcall et al. 2003); the best-fit relation is approximated by\n\u03c38 \u03a90.6\n(2)\nm = 0.33 \u00b1 0.03\nwhich has a steeper \u03a9m dependence than the high-redshift constraint. These two independent\nconstraints overlap only at low \u03a9m . Requiring that both of the constraints of equations [1]\nand [2] be simultaneously satisfied yields\n\u03c38 = 0.98 \u00b1 0.1\n\n(3a)\n\n\u03a9m = 0.17 \u00b1 0.05\n\n(3b)\n\nfor the allowed 1-sigma overlap region when h=0.72 and n=1. Allowing for variations in\nh and n as discussed above yields the same central values for \u03c38 and \u03a9m , but broadens the\nallowed range. Even with the very broad ranges adopted for h and n, the conservative limits\n\u03c38 > 0.70 and \u03a9m < 0.36 can be set at the 95% confidence level.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nWe use the observed abundance of high-mass clusters of galaxies at z = 0.5 \u2212 0.8 to\ndetermine the linear amplitude of mass fluctuations, \u03c38 . The cluster abundance depends\nexponentially on this amplitude, and only weakly on other parameters; it therefore provides\na powerful method for measuring this important parameter. We show that the relatively high\nabundance of massive clusters observed at z & 0.5, as well as their relatively slow evolution\nwith time, requires a high amplitude of mass fluctuations, \u03c38 \u223c 0.9 \u2212 1. This conclusion is\nnearly independent of the exact value of \u03a9m (in the typical range of \u03a9m \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.4).\nWe use the observed abundance at z & 0.5 to determine a normalization relation from\n= 0.78 \u00b1 0.08;\nhigh redshift clusters. The relation depends only weakly on \u03a9m : \u03c38 \u03a90.14\nm\nalternatively, a linear relation of the form \u03c38 = 1.03 \u2212 0.3\u03a9m (\u00b110%) provides a similarly\ngood fit to the data. These fits illustrate that \u03c38 & 0.8 for any \u03a9m \u2264 0.4. For the typical\nobservationally suggested value of \u03a9m \u2243 0.2 \u2212 0.3, the amplitude is \u03c38 = 0.95 \u00b1 0.1. We\nemphasize that this high \u03c38 value indicated by the cluster abundance at high redshift is\nnearly independent of the exact value of \u03a9m .\nWe combine the high redshift constraint above with the independent normalization\nrelation obtained from low redshift cluster abundance- a relation that is steeper in \u03a9m\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(\u223c \u03a90.6\nm ; equation [2]). The combination breaks the degeneracy between the two parameters.\nWe find \u03c38 = 0.98 \u00b1 0.1 and \u03a9m = 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 (Figure 3; equation [3]).\nThe high value of \u03c38 required to explain the high abundance of the most massive clusters\nat z & 0.5 is consistent with the present day cluster mass function if the mass density\nparameter is low, \u03a9m \u223c 0.2. If \u03a9m =0.3, then the high redshift clusters still require a high\namplitude (\u03c38 = 0.92 \u00b1 0.1), since this constraint is nearly independent of \u03a9m ; the low\nredshift cluster abundance is consistent with this value at the 2-sigma level.\nThese results improve upon Bahcall & Fan (1998) by using improvements over the standard Press-Schechter formula (which does not accurately reproduce results from cosmological\nsimulations at high redshift), allowing for changes in h and n, and by using a more recent\ncluster normalization relation at low redshift. The current results yield slightly lower values\nfor the cosmological parameters than the previous work (the latter suggested \u03c38 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.22\nand \u03a9m = 0.2+0.13\n\u22120.07 (68%) when using the most massive clusters) but are consistent with the\nnew values within the error-bars (Bahcall & Fan 1998; Fan, Bahcall & Cen 1997).\nThe excess CMB fluctuations detected on small scales by the CBI (Mason et al. 2002)\nand the BIMA (Dawson et al. 2002) experiments implies (if correctly interpreted as being\ndue to the S-Z effect from distant clusters) that \u03c38 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.12 (95%; Komatsu & Seljak\n2002). This is in excellent agreement with our current conclusions. We note, however, that\nthis high amplitude is inconsistent with the lower value of \u03c38 \u2248 0.7 suggested by current\nCMB data on large scales (which is degenerate with the unknown optical depth). Future\nCMB observations should clarify this current inconsistency. If massive clusters exist with\nrelatively high abundance at high redshifts, as suggested by the data used here (as well as by\ndeep X-ray surveys, e.g. Rosati, Borgani & Norman 2002), then these clusters should indeed\nproduce the excess S-Z fluctuations observed by the CMB data.\nThe relatively high abundance of massive clusters observed at z & 0.5 provides one of\nthe strongest arguments for a high amplitude of mass fluctuations, \u03c38 \u2243 1.\nNote added March 7, 2003: The recent CMB anisotropy spectrum released by the\nWMAP team in February 2003 nicely confirms the results presented here. The constraint\nfrom the CMB alone is \u03c38 = 0.9 \u00b10.1 (Spergel et al. 2003), in full agreement with the current\nhigh redshift cluster constraint.\nThis research was supported by the National Computational Science Alliance under\nNSF Cooperative Agreement ASC97-40300, PACI Subaward 766.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBahcall, N.A. & Fan, X. 1998, ApJ, 504, 1\nBahcall, N.A., Fan, X. & Cen, R. 1997, ApJ, 485, L53\nBahcall, N.A. & Sette, A. 2002, Junior Thesis, Princeton University\nBahcall, N.
