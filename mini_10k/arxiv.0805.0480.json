Consider an nvertex graph G which is connected and undirected. Take n particles labeled 1, 2, ..., n. In a configuration, there is one particle at each vertex. The interchange process is the following continuous-time\nMarkov chain on configurations. For each edge (i, j), at rate 1 the particles at vertex i and vertex\nj are interchanged.\nThe interchange process is reversible, and its stationary distribution is uniform on all n! configurations. There is a spectral gap \u03bbIP (G) > 0, which is the absolute value of the largest non-zero\neigenvalue of the transition rate matrix. If instead we just watch a single particle, it performs a\ncontinuous-time random walk on G (hereafter referred to simply as \"the continuous-time random\nwalk on G\"), which is also reversible and hence has a spectral gap \u03bbRW (G) > 0. Simple arguments\n(the contraction principle) show \u03bbIP (G) \u2264 \u03bbRW (G).\nProblem. Prove \u03bbIP (G) = \u03bbRW (G) for all G.\nDiscussion. Fix m and color particles 1, 2, ...., m red. Then the red particles in the interchange\nprocess behave as the usual exclusion process (i.e., m particles performing the continuous-time\nrandom walk on G, but with moves that take two particles to the same vertex suppressed). But in\nthe finite setting, the interchange process seems more natural.\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of California, Davis CA 95616.\nEmail: morris@math.ucdavis.edu.

Their proof uses a similar approach, although the present paper\nis somewhat shorter.\nConnection to simple exclusion. Our result gives a bound on the spectral gap for the\nexclusion process. The exclusion process is a widely studied Markov chain, with connections to card\nshuffling [16, 1], statistical mechanics [8, 13, 2, 15], and a variety of other processes (see e.g., [10, 6]);\nit has been one of the major examples behind the study of convergence rates for Markov chains\n(see, e.g., [6, 3, 16, 1]). Our result implies that the spectral gap for the symmetric exclusion process\nin BL is asymptotic to \u03c0 2 /L2 . The problem of bounding the spectral gap for simple exclusion was\nstudied in Quastel [13] and a subsequent independent paper of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste [3]. Both\nof these papers used a comparison to Bernoulli-Laplace diffusion (i.e., the exclusion process in the\ncomplete graph) to obtain a bound of order 1/dL2 . Diaconis and Saloff-Coste explicitly wondered\nwhether the factor d in the denominator is necessary; in the present paper we show that it is not.\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nConsider a continuous-time Markov chain on a finite state space W with a symmetric transition\nrate matrix Q(x, y). The spectral gap is the minimum value of \u03b1 > 0 such that\nQf = \u2212\u03b1f,\n\n(1)\n\nfor some f : W \u2192 R. The spectral gap governs the asymptotic rate of convergence to the stationary\ndistribution. Define\nX\n1\n(f (x) \u2212 f (y))2 Q(x, y),\nE(f, f ) =\n2|W | x,y\u2208W\nand define\nvar(f ) =\n\n1 X\n(f (x) \u2212 E(f ))2 ,\n|W | x\u2208W\n\nwhere\nE(f ) =\n\n1 X\nf (x).\n|W | x\u2208W\n\nIf f is a function that satisfies Qf = \u2212\u03bbf for some \u03bb > 0, then\n\u03bb=\n\nE(f, f )\n.\nvar(f )\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fFurthermore, if \u03b1 is the spectral gap then for any non-constant f : W \u2192 R we have\nE(f, f )\n\u2265 \u03b1.\nvar(f )\n\n(3)\n\nThus the spectral gap can be obtained by minimizing the left hand side of (3) over all non-constant\nfunctions f : W \u2192 R.\n\n3\n\nMain result\n\nBefore specializing to the interchange process, we first prove a general proposition relating the\neigenvalues of a certain function of a Markov chain to the eigenvalues of the Markov chain itself.\nLet Xt be a continuous-time Markov chain on a finite state space W with a symmetric transition\nrate matrix Q(x, y). Let T be another space and let g : W \u2192 T be a function on W such that if\nP\nP\ng(x) = g(y) and U = g \u22121 (u) for some u, then u\u2032 \u2208U Q(x, u\u2032 ) = u\u2032 \u2208U Q(y, u\u2032 ). Note that g(Xt )\nis a Markov chain. Let W \u2032 denote the collection of subsets of W of the form g\u22121 (u) for some\nu \u2208 T . We can identify the states of g(Xn ) with elements of W \u2032 . Let Q\u2032 denote the transition rate\nmatrix for g(Xn ). Note that if U, U \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 , with U = g \u22121 (u) for some u \u2208 T and U 6= U \u2032 , then\nP\nQ\u2032 (U, U \u2032 ) = y\u2208U \u2032 Q(u, y).\nWe shall need the following proposition, which generalizes Lemma 2 of [7].\nProposition 1 Let Xt , g and Q\u2032 be as defined above. Suppose f : W \u2192 R is an eigenvector of Q\nP\nwith corresponding eigenvalue \u2212\u03bb and define h : W \u2032 \u2192 R by h(U ) = x\u2208U f (x). Then Q\u2032 h = \u2212\u03bbh.\nThat is, either h is an eigenvector of Q\u2032 with corresponding eigenvalue \u2212\u03bb, or h is identically zero.\nProof: Note that for all U \u2032 \u2208 W \u2032 we have\n(Q\u2032 h)(U \u2032 ) =\n\nX\n\nh(U )Q\u2032 (U, U \u2032 )\n\nU \u2208W \u2032\n\n=\n\nX X\n\nf (x)\n\nU \u2208W \u2032 x\u2208U\n\n=\n\nX\n\ny\u2208U \u2032\n\n= \u2212\u03bb\n\nX\n\nQ(x, y)\n\ny\u2208U \u2032\n\n(Qf )(y)\nX\n\nf (y)\n\ny\u2208U \u2032\n\u2032\n\n= \u2212\u03bbh(U ),\nso Q\u2032 h = \u2212\u03bbh.\nThe following Lemma is a weaker version of Aldous's conjecture. The proof is similar to the\nproof of Theorem 1 in [7].\nLemma 2 Let G be a connected, undirected graph with vertices labeled 1, . . . , n. For 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n let\nGk be the subgraph of G induced by the vertices 1, 2, . . . , k. Let \u03bbRW (Gk ) be the spectral gap for the\ncontinuous-time random walk on Gk , and define \u03b1k = min2\u2264j\u2264k \u03bbRW (Gj ). Then\n\u03bbIP (G) \u2265 \u03b1n .\n3\n\n\fProof: Our prooof will be by induction on the number of vertices n. The base case n = 2 is\ntrivial, so assume n > 2. Let W and Q be the state space and transition rate matrix, respectively,\nfor the interchange process on G. Let f : W \u2192 R be a function that satisfies Qf = \u2212\u03bbf . We shall\nshow that \u03bb \u2265 \u03b1n . Note that a configuration of the interchange process can be identified with a\npermutation \u03c0 in S n , where if particle i is in vertex j, then \u03c0(i) = j. For positive integers m and\nk with m, k \u2264 n, we write f (\u03c0(m) = k) for\nX\n\nf (\u03c0).\n\n\u03c0:\u03c0(m)=k\n\nWe consider two cases.\nCase 1: For some m and k we have f (\u03c0(m) = k) 6= 0. Define h : V \u2192 R by h(j) = f (\u03c0(m) = j).\nThen h is not identically zero, and using Proposition 1 with g defined by g(\u03c0) = \u03c0(m) gives that if\nQ\u2032 is the transition rate matrix for continuous time random walk on G, then Q\u2032 h = \u2212\u03bbh. It follows\nthat \u03bb is an eigenvalue of Q\u2032 and hence \u03bb \u2265 \u03bbRW (G) = \u03b1n .\nCase 2: For all m and k we have f (\u03c0(m) = k) = 0. Define the suppressed process as the interchange process with moves involving vertex n suppressed. That is, the Markov chain with the\nfollowing transition rule:\nFor every edge e not incident to n, at rate 1 switch the particles at the endpoints of e.\nFor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, let Wk = {\u03c0 \u2208 W : \u03c0 \u22121 (n) = k}. Note that the Wk are the irreducible classes of\nthe suppressed process, and that for each k the restriction of the suppressed process to Wk can be\nidentified with the interchange process on Gn\u22121 . For k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, define\nEk (f, f ) =\n\nX\n1\n(f (\u03c01 ) \u2212 f (\u03c02 ))2 Q(\u03c01 , \u03c02 ),\n2(n \u2212 1)! \u03c0 ,\u03c0 \u2208W\n1\n\nand define\nvark (f ) =\n\n2\n\nk\n\nX\n1\nf (\u03c0)2 .\n(n \u2212 1)! \u03c0\u2208W\nk\n\nP\n\n(Note that for every k we have \u03c0\u2208Wk f (x) = 0.)\nBy the induction hypothesis, the spectral gap for the interchange process on Gn\u22121 is at least\n\u03b1n\u22121 . Hence for every k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n we have\nEk (f, f ) \u2265 \u03b1n\u22121 vark (f ) \u2265 \u03b1n vark (f ).\nIt follows that\nn!E(f, f ) \u2265\n\n1\n2\n\nn\nX\n\nX\n\n(f (\u03c01 ) \u2212 f (\u03c02 ))2 Q(\u03c01 , \u03c02 )\n\n(4)\n\nk=1 \u03c01 ,\u03c02 \u2208Wk\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2265\n\nk=1\nn\nX\n\n(n \u2212 1)!Ek (f, f )\n\u03b1n (n \u2212 1)!vark (f )\n\nk=1\n\n4\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\f= \u03b1n\n\nn X\nX\n\nf (\u03c0)2\n\n(7)\n\nk=1 \u03c0\u2208Wk\n\n= \u03b1n n!var(f ).\n\n(8)\n\nCombining this with equation (2) gives \u03bb \u2265 \u03b1n .\nRemark: Theorem 2 is optimal if the vertices are labeled in such a way that \u03bbRW (Gk ) is nonincreasing in k, in which case it gives \u03bbIP (G) = \u03bbRW (G). Since any tree can be built up from smaller\ntrees (with larger spectral gaps), we recover the result proved in [7] that \u03bbIP (T ) = \u03bbRW (T ) if T is\na tree.\nOur main application of Lemma 2 is the following asymptotic version of Aldous's conjecture in\nthe special case where G is a box in Zd .\nCorollary 3 Let BL = {0, . . . , L}d be a box of side length L in Zd . Then the spectral gap for the\ninterchange process on BL is asymptotic to \u03c0 2 /L2 .\nProof: In order to use Lemma 2 we need to label the vertices of BL in some way. Our goal is to\nlabel in such a way that for every k the quantity \u03bbRW (Gk ) (i.e., the spectral gap corresponding to\nthe subgraph of BL induced by the vertices 1, . . . , k) is not too much smaller than \u03bbRW (BL ). So our\ntask is to build BL , one vertex at a time, in such a way that the spectral gaps of the intermediate\ngraphs don't get too small.\nWe shall build BL by inductively building BL\u22121 and then building BL from BL\u22121 . Since\n\u03bbRW (BL ) \u2193 0, it is enough to show that\n\u03b2L\n\u2192 1,\n\u03bbRW (BL )\nwhere \u03b2L is the minimum spectral gap for any intermediate graph between BL\u22121 and BL .\nFor a graph H, let V (H) denote the set of vertices in H. For j \u2265 0, let Lj = {0, . . . , j} be\nthe line graph with j + 1 vertices. Define \u03b3L = \u03bbRW (LL ). It is well known that \u03b3L is decreasing\nin L and asymptotic to \u03c0 2 /L2 as L \u2192 \u221e. It is also well known that if H and H \u2032 are graphs and\n\u00d7 denotes Cartesian product, then \u03bbRW (H \u00d7 H \u2032 ) = min(\u03bbRW (H), \u03bbRW (H \u2032 )). Since BL = LdL , it\nfollows that \u03bbRW (BL ) = \u03b3L .\nWe construct BL from BL\u22121 using intermediate graphs H0 , . . . , Hd , where for k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d\nwe define Hk = LkL \u00d7 Ld\u2212k\nL\u22121 . Note that H0 = BL\u22121 and Hd = BL . We obtain Hk from Hk\u22121 by\nadding vertices to lengthen Hk\u22121 by one unit in direction k. The order in which the vertices in\nV (Hk ) \u2212 V (Hk\u22121 ) are added is arbitrary.\nFix k with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d, and define G\u2032 = G\u2032 (L, k) as follows. Let\nV \u2032 = V (Hk ),\n\nE \u2032 = {(u, v) : either u or v is a vertex in Hk\u22121 },\n\nand let G\u2032 = (V \u2032 , E \u2032 ). It is well known and easily shown that if H is a graph, then adding edges\nto H cannot decrease \u03bbRW (H), nor can removing pendant edges. Since each intermediate graph\nG\u0303 between Hk\u22121 and Hk can be obtained from G\u2032 by adding edges and removing pendant edges,\nit follows that for any such graph G\u0303 we have \u03bbRW (G\u0303) \u2265 \u03bbRW (G\u2032 ). Thus, it is enough to bound\n\n5\n\n\f\u03bbRW (G\u2032 ) from below. We shall show that for any \u01eb > 0 we have \u03bbRW (G\u2032 (L, k)) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b3L if L is\nsufficiently large.\nLet ek be the unit vector in direction k. Let\n\u2202S = V \u2032 \u2212 S.\n\nS = V (Hk\u22121 );\n\nLet Xt be the continuous-time random walk on G\u2032 , with transition rate matrix Q. Fix f : V \u2032 \u2192 R\nwith Qf = \u2212\u03bbf for some \u03bb > 0. For x \u2208 Zd , let gk (x) denote the component of x in the\nkth coordinate. Note that gk (Xt ) is the continuous-time random walk on LL . Let Q\u2032 be the\ntransition rate matrix for gk (Xt ). Proposition 1 implies that if h : {0, . . . , L} \u2192 R is defined by\nP\n\u2032\nh(j) =\nx\u2208V \u2032 f (x), then Q h = \u2212\u03bbh. Thus if \u03bb < \u03b3L , then g is identically zero and hence\nP\n\ngk (x)=j\n\nx\u2208S f (x) = 0. Define\n\nE(f, f ) =\n\nX\n1\n(f (x) \u2212 f (y))2 Q(x, y),\n2|V \u2032 | x,y\u2208V \u2032\n\nand let ES (f, f ) be defined analogously, but with only vertices in S included in the sum. Note that\nP\nE(f, f ) \u2265 ES (f, f ). Since x\u2208S f (x) = 0, we have\nES (f, f )\n\u2265 \u03bbRW (Hk\u22121 ) \u2265 \u03b3L ,\n2\nx\u2208S f (x)\n\nP\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the second inequality follows from the fact that Hk\u22121 is a Cartesian product of d graphs,\neach of which is either LL\u22121 or LL .\nFix \u01eb > 0 and let M be a positive integer large enough so that (1 \u2212 4M \u22121 )\u22121 \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u22121/2 .\nFor each x \u2208 \u2202S, say that x is good if there is a y \u2208 S such that x = y + iek for some i \u2264 M\nand |f (y)| \u2264 |f (x)|/2. Otherwise say that x is bad. Let G and B denote the set of good and bad\n4 PM\n2\nvertices, respectively, in \u2202S. Note that if x is bad and M \u2264 L then f (x)2 \u2264 M\nj=1 f (x \u2212 jek ) .\nSumming this over bad x gives\nX\n4 X\nf (x)2\n(10)\nf (x)2 \u2264\nM\n\u2032\nx\u2208B\nx\u2208V\nNote that if x is good, then there must be an x\u2032 \u2208 S of the form x\u2212iek such that |f (x\u2032 )\u2212f (x\u2032 +ek )| >\nf (x)/2M . It follows that\nE(f, f )\nP\n\u2265 1/4M 2 .\n(11)\n2\nx\u2208G f (x)\nSince V \u2032 = S \u222a B \u222a G, combining equations (11), (9) and (10) gives\nX\nx\u2208V\n\nand hence\n\nf (x)2 \u2264 (\u03b3L\u22121 + 4M 2 )E(f, f ) + 4M \u22121\n\nx\u2208V\n\n\u2032\n\nX\n\nX\n\nf (x)2 ,\n\u2032\n\nf (x)2 \u2264 (1 \u2212 4M \u22121 )\u22121 (\u03b3L\u22121 + 4M 2 )E(f, f ).\n\n(12)\n\nx\u2208V \u2032\n1\n\nRecall that (1\u22124M \u22121 )\u22121 \u2264 (1\u2212\u01eb)\u2212 2 , and note that since \u03b3L \u2192 0 as L \u2192 \u221e, we have \u03b3L\u22121 +4M 2 \u2264\n1\n\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u2212 2 \u03b3L\u22121 for sufficiently large L. Combining this with equation (12) gives\nP\n\nE(f, f )\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b3L ,\n2\nx\u2208V \u2032 f (x)\n6\n\n\ffor sufficiently large L. It follows that \u03bbRW (G\u2032 ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u03b3L for sufficiently large L and so the proof\nis complete.\n\nReferences\n[1] Benjamini, I., Berger, N., Hoffman, C., and Mossel, E.
