The question arises, whether\nthe two classes are intrinsically the same or not, that is, whether HBLRs are\nalways there, even if sometimes - in the case of non-HBLR Sy-2's - they are not\nseen, due e.g to obscuration. Tran (2001), on the basis of the CfA and 12 \u03bcm\nsamples of Sy-2's, claimed that HBLR galaxies display distinctly higher radio\npower relative to their infrared power, and hotter dust temperature. Since the\naverage obscuration appears to be indistinguishable between the two classes,\nhe proposed that HBLRs galaxies harbor an energetic, hidden Sy-1 nucleus\n(where broad lines are produced), while non-HBLRs galaxies do not. 10\nWe went through Tran's sample, searching in the literature for measurements of the intrinsic X-ray (2-10 keV) and OIII (5007 \u00c5) luminosities (LX ,\nLOIII ), together with the column density (nH ), in order to test Tran's hypothesis of an intrinsic difference between the two classes.\n2\n\nThe sample\n\nWe had to exclude many Sy-2 galaxies from the sample, for which: either\nno X-ray observations have been performed with \"modern\" satellites (starting\nwith ASCA), or no estimates of the OIII flux could be found, or any estimate\nof the intrinsic (nucleus) luminosity is unreliable due to Compton-thickness\n(nH > 1024 cm\u22122 ). We also considered additional galaxies, not belonging to\nTran's ensemble: based on the same criteria, we could finally add only the\nHBLR galaxy MKN 1210 in the sample. The final sample consists of 10 HBLR\nand 6 non-HBLR objects. The values of the luminosities are corrected for\n1\n\n\fSource name\n\nLX\n\nLOIII\n\nnH (\u00d71022 cm\u22122 )\n\nReferences\n\nIRAS 05189-2524\nIRAS 22017+0319\nIC 5063\nMCG-3-34-64\nMKN 348 (NGC 262)\nMKN 463E (UGC 8850)\nNGC 4388\nNGC 5506\nNGC 6552\nUGC 4203 (MKN 1210)\n\n26.96\n32.7\n9.43\n4.3\n12.19\n8.0\n7.44\n10.07\n3.6\n19\n\n3.67\n3.6\u2217\n1.1\n2.68\n0.97\n7.78\n0.65\n0.56\n1.64\n2.14\n\n4.9\n5.41\n24\n79\n10.6\n16\n42\n3.4\n60\n21.4\n\n[2]\n[9],BOA# ,[3]\n[2]\n[2]\n[2]\n[2], [1]\n[2]\n[2], [8]\n[2]\n[2], [5]\n\nTable 1: Above: Galaxies with HBLRs.

Tran (2001) claimed that HBLR\ngalaxies are those which actually do possess nuclei of Seyfert 1 type, while nonHBLR galaxies would not, the latter being \"powered\" mainly by starburst.10\nIf this is the case, broad lines regions simply would not exist in the cores of\nthose galaxies where polarized broad lines are not observed. However, Seyfert\n1 galaxies with L2\u221210keV < 1042 erg s\u22121 are observed indeed, and there is no\nreason why Sy-1 type nuclei (i.e. hidden broad line regions) with L2\u221210keV <\n1042 erg s\u22121 should not be present in the cores of some Seyfert 2s, too.\nEven if, on the base of Tran's as well as our present study, a unifying\nmodel based only on inclination (such as the one by Heisler et al.6 ) seems\nto be ruled out, nevertheless one may suppose that the intrinsic difference\noriginates also in some property of the reflector. One possible explanation is,\nthat in the so-called non-HBLR Sy-2 galaxies (L2\u221210keV < 1042 erg s\u22121 ) the\nirradiation from the nucleus is not strong enough to allow sublimation of dust\ngrains and ionization of the more distant clouds (those located outside the\ntorus). Thus, the broad lines cannot be reflected towards us, and are rather\nabsorbed by the clouds themselves. Conversely, in the so-called HBLR Sy-2s,\nthe irradiation efficiently ionizes the distant clouds too, so that we can observe\npolarized (reflected) broad lines.\nReferences\n[1] Awaki H., Ueno S., Taniguchi Y., Weaver K.A.
