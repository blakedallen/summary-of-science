A promising possibility to explain these sources is given by in situ stochastic\nreacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster volume\nduring merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that the expected fraction of clusters with radio halos and the increase of such a fraction with\ncluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a fraction of\n20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of compressible modes.\nIn this work we extend the above mentioned analysis, by including a scaling of\nthe magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that, in the framework of the\nreacceleration model, the observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power\nof a sample of 17 GRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent\nwith, and actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of\n>0.5 and typical \u03bcG strengths of the average B intensity.\nthe form B \u221d Mvb , with b\u223c\nThe occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and redshift is obtained:\nthe evolution of such a probability depends on the interplay between synchrotron and\ninverse Compton losses in the emitting volume, and it is maximized in clusters for\nwhich the two losses are comparable.\nThe most relevant findings are that the predicted luminosity functions of GRHs are\npeaked around a power P1.4GHz \u223c 1024 W/Hz , and severely cut-off at low radio\npowers due to the decrease of the electron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters,\nand that the occurrence of GRHs at 1.4 GHz beyond a redshift z \u223c 0.7 appears to\nbe negligible. As a related check we also show that the predicted integral radio source\ncounts within a limited volume (z 6 0.2) are consistent with present observational\nconstraints. Extending the source counts beyond z=0.2 we estimate that the total\nnumber of GRHs to be discovered at \u223c mJy radio fluxes could be \u223c 100 at 1.4 GHz.\nFinally, the occurrence of GRHs and their number counts at 150 MHz are estimated\nin view of the fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories (LOFAR, LWA)\nand compared with those at higher radio frequencies.\nKey words: particle acceleration - turbulence - radiation mechanisms: non\u2013thermal\n- galaxies: clusters: general - radio continuum: general - X\u2013rays: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe intracluster medium (ICM) is a mixture of thermal and\nnon-thermal components and a precise physical description\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: rcassano@ira.inaf.it\n\nof the ICM also requires adequate knowledge of the role of\nnon-thermal components.\nThe most detailed evidence for non-thermal phenomena\ncomes from the radio observations. A number of clusters\nof galaxies are known to contain wide diffuse synchrotron\nsources (radio halos and relics) which have no obvious connection with the individual cluster galaxies, but are rather\n\n\f2\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\nassociated to the ICM (e.g., Giovannini & Feretti 2000;\nKempner & Sarazin 2001; see Giovannini & Feretti 2002 for\na review). The synchrotron emission of such sources requires\na population of GeV relativistic electrons (and/or positrons)\nand cluster magnetic fields on \u03bcG levels. Evidence for relativistic electrons (and positrons) in the ICM may also come\nfrom the detection of hard X-ray (HXR) excess emission in\nthe case of a few galaxy clusters (e.g., Rephaeli & Gruber\n2003, Fusco\u2013Femiano et al. 2004), and possibly from extreme\nultra-violet (EUV) excess emission (e.g., Kaastra et al. 2003;\nBowyer et al. 2004). It is also believed that the amount of the\nenergy budget of high energy protons in the ICM might be\nsignificant, due to the confinement of cosmic rays over cosmological time scales (V\u00f6lk et al. 1996; Berezinsky, Blasi &\nPtuskin 1997; Ensslin et al. 1997). Nevertheless, the gamma\nradiation that would allow to infer the fraction of relativistic\nhadrons in clusters has not been detected as yet (Reimer et\nal., 2003, see Pfrommer & Ensslin 2004 for upper limit on\nthis fraction).\nShock waves are unavoidably formed during merger\nevents; they may efficiently accelerate relativistic particles\ncontributing to the injection of relativistic hadrons and\nof relativistic emitting electrons in the ICM (e.g., Ryu et\nal. 2003, Gabici & Blasi 2003). However the accelerated electrons have a short pathlength due to IC losses and thus they\ncan travel a short distance away from the shock front, emitting synchrotron radiation concentrated around the shock\nrim (e.g., Miniati et al. 2001). Radio Relics, which are polarized and elongated radio sources located in the cluster\nperipheral regions, may indeed be associated to these shock\nwaves, as a result of Fermi-I diffusive shock acceleration of\nICM electrons (Ensslin et al. 1998; Roettiger et al. 1999),\nor of adiabatic energization of relativistic electrons confined\nin fossil radio plasma, released in the past by active radio\ngalaxies (Ensslin & Gopal-Krishna 2001; Hoeft et al. 2004).\nThe most spectacular evidence of diffuse synchrotron\nemission in galaxy clusters is that associated to giant radio\nhalos, Mpc-size radio sources which permeate the cluster\nvolume similarly to the X\u2013ray emitting gas. In this respect,\ntwo main possibilities have been investigated in some detail to explain that GeV electrons (and/or positrons) are\npresent and able to radiate on distance scales larger than\ntheir typical loss lengths: i) the so-called reacceleration models, whereby relativistic electrons (and positrons) injected in\nthe ICM by a variety of processes active during the life of\ngalaxy clusters are continuously re-energized in situ during\nthe life\u2013time of the observed radio halos (which is estimated\nto be \u223c 1 Gyr, Kuo et al. 2004) and ii) the secondary electron models, whereby electrons are secondary products of\nthe hadronic interactions of cosmic rays with the intracluster medium, as first proposed by Dennison (1980). Although\nthe origin of the emitting particles in radio halos is still a\nmatter of debate (e.g., Ensslin 2004), the above two models\nfor the production of the radiating electrons (and positrons)\nhave a substantial predictive power, which can be used to\ndiscriminate among such models by comparing their predictions with observations. Although future observations remain crucial to achieve a firm conclusion, at least as far\nas the few well studied clusters and the analysis of statistical samples are concerned, present data seem to suggest the\npresence of in situ particle\u2013reacceleration mechanisms ac-\n\ntive in the ICM (e.g., Brunetti 2003,04; Blasi 2004; Feretti\net al. 2004; Hwang 2004; Reimer et al. 2004).\nRadio observations of galaxy clusters indicate that the\ndetection rate of radio halos shows an abrupt increase with\nincreasing the X-ray luminosity of the host clusters. In particular, about 30-35% of the galaxy clusters with X-ray luminosity larger than 1045 erg/s show diffuse non-thermal\nradio emission (Giovannini & Feretti 2002); these clusters\nhave also high temperature (kT > 7 keV) and large mass\n> 2\u00d7 1015 M\u2299 ). Furthermore, giant radio halos are always\n(\u223c\nfound in merging clusters (e.g., Buote 2001; Schuecker et al\n2001). Although the physics of particle acceleration due to\nturbulence generated in merging clusters has been investigated in some detail (e.g., Schlickeiser et al. 1987; Petrosian\n2001; Fujita et al 2003; Brunetti et al. 2004; Brunetti &\nBlasi 2005) and the model expectations seem to reproduce\nthe observed radio features and possibly also the hard X\u2013\nrays (e.g., Brunetti et al. 2001; Kuo et al. 2003; Brunetti\n2004; Hwang 2004), a theoretical investigation of the statistical properties of the Mpc diffuse emission in galaxy clusters\nin the framework of these models has not been carried out\nextensively as yet. In particular, the fact that giant radio\nhalos are always associated to massive galaxy clusters and\nthe presence of a trend between their radio power and the\nmass (temperature, X-ray luminosity) of the parent clusters\nmay be powerful tools to test and constrain present models.\nIn a recent paper Cassano & Brunetti (2005; hereafter\nCB05) have modelled the statistical properties of giant radio\nhalos in the framework of the merger\u2013induced in situ particle\nacceleration scenario. By adopting the semi\u2013analytic Press\n& Schechter (1974; PS74) theory to follow the cosmic evolution and formation of a large synthetic population of galaxy\nclusters, it was assumed that the energy injected in the form\nof magnetosonic waves during merging events in clusters is\na fraction, \u03b7t , of the P dV work done by the infalling subclusters in passing through the most massive one. Then the\nprocesses of stochastic acceleration of the relativistic electrons by these waves, and the ensuing synchrotron emission\nproperties, have been worked out under the assumption that\nthe magnetic field intensities, ICM temperatures and particle densities (both thermal and non-thermal) have constant\nvolume averaged values (within 1 Mpc3 ). The main findings of these calculations is that giant radio halos are naturally expected only in the more massive clusters, and the\nexpected fraction of clusters with radio halos (at redshifts\n< 0.2) can be reconciled with the observed one under viable\nz\u223c\nassumptions (\u03b7t \u2243 0.24\u22120.34 ). Specifically, the probability\nto form giant radio halos in the synthetic cluster population\nwas found to be of order 20-30 % in the more massive galaxy\nclusters (M > 2\u00d71015 M\u2299 ), 2-5 % in M \u223c 1015 M\u2299 clusters,\nand negligible in less massive systems. Such increase of the\nprobability with the cluster mass is essentially due to the\nincrease of both the energy density of turbulence and of the\nturbulence injection volume with cluster mass (see CB05).\nThe present paper is a natural extension of the CB05\nwork, the most important difference being that here we\nadopt a scaling law between the rms magnetic field strength\n(averaged in the synchrotron emitting volume) and the virial\nmass of the parent clusters, B \u221d M b . We carry out a detailed comparison between statistical data of giant radio halos currently available and model expectations as derived by\nadopting the CB05 procedures.\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\n3\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n44\n\nFigure 1. Correlation between the radio power at 1.4 GHz and\nthe X-ray luminosity between [0.1-2.4] kev for the GRHs.\n\nIn Sec. 2 we collect radio and X-ray data for well known\ngiant radio halos from the literature and derive radio\u2013X-ray\ncorrelations. In Sec. 3 we investigate the possibility to match\nthe observed radio\u2013X-ray correlations for giant radio halos\nwith electron acceleration models. This comparison provides\nstringent constraints on the physical parameters in the ICM,\nin particular for the magnetic field in galaxy clusters. In\nSec. 4 we derive the expected probability to form giant radio\nhalos as a function of Mv and z. This is done by adopting\nthe same values of the physical parameters which allows to\naccount for the observed radio\u2013X-ray correlations. In Secs.5\u2013\n6 we finally calculate the expected luminosity functions and\nnumber counts of giant radio halos.\nAs in CB05, we focus our attention on giant radio halos only (linear size \u223c1 h\u22121\n50 Mpc, GRHs elsewhere). The\nadopted cosmology is: \u039bCDM (Ho = 70 Km s\u22121 M pc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9o,m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03c38 = 0.9).\n\n2\n\nOBSERVED CORRELATIONS\n\nIn this section we discuss the observed correlations between\nthe X-ray and the radio properties of clusters hosting GRHs.\nWe collect galaxy clusters with known GRHs from the literature obtaining a total sample of 17 clusters. In Tab. 1\nwe report the radio and X-ray properties of this sample in\na \u039bCDM cosmology. In order to have the best estimate of\nthe X-ray temperatures we select results from XMM-Newton\nobservations when available, otherwise we use ASCA results\nor combine ASCA and Chandra information. We investigate\nthe correlations between the X-ray and the radio properties\nof the selected clusters by making use of a linear regression\nfit in log-log space following the procedures given in Akritas\n& Bershady (1996). This method allows for intrinsic scatter\nand errors in both variables.\n\n44.5\n\n45\n\n45.5\n\nFigure 2. Halo radio brightness at 1.4 GHz, normalized to the\nradio brightness of A3562 (which is just visible in the NVSS),\nversus X-ray luminosity between [0.1-2.4] keV. Different symbols\nindicate GRHs (filled circles) and smaller radio halos (open circles) visible in the NVSS. Asterisks mark A2256, which falls below\nthe NVSS surface brightness limit, and 1E50657-558, which falls\nbelow the declination range of the NVSS. Large circles mark objects visible in the NVSS and in the redshift range z \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.3.\n\n2.1\n\nRadio Power\u2013X-ray luminosity correlation\n\nThe presence of a correlation between the radio powers and\nthe X-ray luminosities is well known (Liang et al. 2000; Feretti 2000, 2003; Ensslin and R\u00f6ttgering 2002).\nIn Fig.1 we report the correlation between the X-ray\nluminosity (in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy band) and the radio\npower at 1.4 GHz (P1.4 ) for our sample of GRHs. The fit\nhas been performed by using the form:\nlog\n\n\u0010\n\nP1.4 GHz\n3.16 * 1024 h\u22121\n70\n\nW att\nHz\n\n\u0011\n\n= Af +bf log\n\n\u0014\n\nLX\n1045 h\u22121\n70\n\nergs\ns\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the best fit parameters are: Af = 0.159 \u00b1 0.060 and\nbf = 1.97 \u00b1 0.25.\nOur findings are consistent with those of Ensslin and\nR\u00f6ttgering (2002) who used 14 clusters with radio halos\nand found a correlation of the form P1.4 GHz \u221d L1.94\nX . Using 16 clusters with GRHs Feretti (2003) found a correlation between the X-ray bolometric luminosity and the ra1.8\u00b10.2\ndio power at 1.4 GHz of the form P1.4 GHz \u221d (Lbol\n.\nX )\nA consistent result is obtained with the data in Tab. 1\n1.74\u00b10.21\n(P1.4 GHz \u221d (Lbol\n).\nX )\nAlthough the trend in Fig.1 appears quite stringent,\none may wonder wether it could be affected by observational\nbiases. It should be pointed out that most GRHs have been\ndiscovered by follow ups of radio halo candidates mostly\nidentified from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS, Condon\net al. 1998).\nIn Fig.2 we plot the average radio surface brightness of\nGRHs at 1.4 GHz, normalized to the radio brightness of\nA3562 (open circle with the smallest X-ray luminosity),\n\n\f4\n\nR.

We note that all GRHs have\na radio surface brightness which is well above that of A3562\n(with the exception of A2256 not visible in the NVSS). The\nfact that clusters in the redshift range z \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.3 have\nsimilar radio brightnesses indicates that the correlation in\nFig.1 is not driven by the radio surface limit. Indeed, these\nclusters have LX \u223c 3 * 1044 \u2212 3 * 1045 erg/s and range over\nmore than one order of magnitude in radio power, whereas\nthe effect of brightness dimming, due to the small z-range, is\nlimited to within a factor \u223c 1.6. We also note the presence\nof a trend, with the average radio brightness increasing with\nX-ray luminosity (see also Feretti 2004), which further supports the notion that the correlation in Fig.1 at high lumi> 1045 erg/s) is not driven by selection effects.\nnosities (LX \u223c\nFurthermore, relatively deep upper limits for non radio-halo\nclusters are now available and in some cases lie well below\n> 10) the trend in Fig.1 at X-ray luminosities\n(a factor of \u223c\n> 5 * 1044 erg/s (Dolag 2006).\n\u223c\nOn the other hand one may argue that the NVSS tends\nto select only the most powerful GRHs associated with\n< 5 * 1044 erg/s clusters. To evaluate the effect of a posLX \u223c\nsible bias at these luminosities, we perform a fit by consid> 5 * 1044 and find a slope\nering only GRH clusters with LX \u223c\n2.22 \u00b1 0.36 which is consistent within 1 \u03c3 with Eq. 1.\nThus we conclude that despite the poor statistics, the\nderived correlations (Eq.1) stands on sound observational\nbasis.\n2.2\n\nRadio Power\u2013ICM temperature correlation\n\nWe also investigate the correlation between the radio power\nat 1.4 GHz and the X-ray ICM temperature. A P1.4 \u2212 T\ncorrelation was first noted by Liang et al.(1999) and Co-\n\nlafrancesco (1999); with a sample of only 8 radio halos\nthe last author obtained a steep trend of the form P1.4 \u221d\n6.25+6.25\n\n\u22122.08 . In Fig. 3a we report the best fit for our sample.\nT\nThe fit has been performed using the form:\n\nlog\n\n\u0014\n\nP1.4 GHz\n3.16 * 1024 h\u22121\n70\n\nW att\nHz\n\n\u0015\n\n= Af + bf log\n\n\u0010\n\nT\n8 keV\n\n\u0011\n\n(2)\n\nand best fit parameters are: Af = \u22120.390 \u00b1 0.139 and\nbf = 9.83 \u00b1 4.92. We note that the observed P1.4 \u2212 T\ncorrelation is very steep, it seems rather a \"wall\" than a\ncorrelation and it is dominated by the large errors of the\ncluster temperatures avaiable to date. In order to test the\nstrength of this correlation we try to increase the sample\nby including also 7 additional clusters with smaller (size\n\u223c 200 \u2212 700 kpc h\u22121\n50 ) radio halos. In Fig. 3b we report the\nbest-fit P1.4 \u2212 T obtained for the extended sample, which\nhas a slope bf = 6.40 \u00b1 1.64. Given the large uncertainties\nwe note that the two correlations are consistent at the 1\u03c3\nlevel and, in addition, the value of the lower allowed bound\nof the two slopes is almost the same.\n\n2.3\n\nRadio Power \u2013 virial mass correlation\n\nThe most important correlation for our study is that between the virial mass (Mv ) of a cluster and the radio power\nat 1.4 GHz. This correlation is indeed extensively used in the\ncalculations of the RHLFs and number counts (Sec.7) and in\nconstraining the values of the magnetic field in galaxy clusters to be used in our calculations (Sec.3). On the other\nhand, this is also the most difficult correlation to derive\nsince it is very difficult to measure the cluster mass. Govoni et al. (2001) first obtained a correlation between the\nradio power and cluster gravitational mass (within 3 h\u22121\n50\n\n\f6\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\nfX (0.1 \u2212 2.4 keV ) > 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 and it covers\nabout 2/3 of the whole sky.\nThe clusters have been reanalyzed in detail by RB02 using\nmainly ROSAT PSPC pointed observations. RB02 report\nthe value of \u03b2 and core radius, rc , for all the 63 clusters\nobtained by fitting the surface brightness profile of the X-ray\nimage with a standard \u03b2-model. Then under the assumption\nthat the intracluster gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium and\nisothermal (using the ideal gas equations), the gravitational\ncluster mass within a radius r is given by (e.g., Sarazin 1986):\nMtot (< r) =\n\nFigure 4. Correlation between the X-ray luminosity [0.1-2.4] keV\nand the virial cluster mass: for the HIFLUGCS sample (black\npoints) plus the 16 clusters with GRHs (red points, excluding\nA2254 for which no information on the \u03b2-model are available)\n(solid line) and for the HIFLUGCS sample alone (dashed line).\n\n3KB T r 3 \u03b2\n\u03bcmp G\n\n\u0010\n\nr2\n\n1\n+ rc2\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\nEq.3 gives the total (dark matter plus gas) mass of the cluster as a function of radius; then one must define a physically\nmeaningful radius to compare masses of different clusters.\nIt is frequently convenient to use r200 meaning the radius\nwithin which the mean total mass density is 200 times the\ncritical density of the universe at the cluster redshift. This\nis because M200 , the mass contained within r200 , is usually\ntaken as a good approximation of the virial mass since in\nthe spherical collapse model the ratio between the average\ndensity within the virial radius and the mean cosmic density at redshift z is \u2206c = 18\u03c0 2 \u2243 178 independent of the\nredshift for \u03a9m = 1 (e.g., Lacey & Cole 1993). In general,\nthe value of \u2206c depends on the adopted cosmology. In the\n\u039bCDM cosmology \u2206c is given by (Kitayama & Suto 1996):\n\u2206c (z) = 18\u03c0 2 (1 + 0.4093\u03c9(z)0.9052 ),\n\nMpc radius) estimated from the surface brightness profile of\nthe X-ray image using 6 radio halo clusters. This correlation\nwas confirmed by Feretti (2003) who extended the sample\nto 10 cluster radio halos and obtained a best fit of the form\nP1.4 \u221d M 2.3 , where M is, again, the gravitational mass computed within 3 h\u22121\n50 Mpc from the cluster center. However\nit should be pointed out that while the X-ray mass determination method gives good results in relaxed clusters, it\nmay fail in the case of merging clusters (e.g., Evrard et al.\n1996, Roettiger et al. 1996; Schindler 1996). This is because\nthe merger may cause substantial deviation from hydrostic\nequilibrium and spherical symmetry. As a result, the masses\nin merging clusters can be either overestimated (up to twice\nthe true mass in the presence of shocks) or underestimated\n(since substructures tend to flatten the average density profile giving an underestimation of the order of 50 % of the\ntrue mass; see Schindler 2002). In addition, if the temperature systematically decreases with increasing radius, then\nthe isothermal assumption leads to an overestimation of the\ncluster mass of about 30% at about six core radii (Markevitch et al. 1998).\nThe effect of the scattering produced by all these uncertainties can hopefully be reduced by making use of large\ncluster samples. Thus, we choose to obtain the P1.4 GHz \u2212Mv\ncorrelation by combining the Lx \u2212 Mv correlation, obtained\nfor a large statistical sample of galaxy clusters, with the\nP1.4 \u2212 Lx correlation previously derived (Eq.1, Fig. 1). We\nuse a complete sample of the X-ray\u2013brightest clusters (HIFLUGCS, the Highest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample)\ncompiled by Reiprich & B\u00f6hringer (2002) (hereafter RB02).\nWe use this sample of luminous clusters (Lx \u223c 1044 \u22121045 erg\ns\u22121 ) since it is large and homogeneously studied. It consists\nof 63 bright clusters with galactic latitude |bII | > 20o , flux\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c9(z) \u2261 \u03a9f (z)\n\u03a9f (z) =\n\n\u22121\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212 1 with:\n\n\u03a9m,0 (1 + z)3\n,\n\u03a9m,0 (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b\n\n(5)\n\nThus, by using Eq.3 we calculate the virial radius, Rv , as\nthe radius at which the ratio between the average density in\nthe cluster and the mean cosmic density at the redshift of\nthe cluster is given by \u2206c (z) (Eq.4). The virial mass, Mv ,\nand the virial radius are thus related by:\nRv =\n\n\"\n\n3Mv\n4\u03c0\u2206c (z)\u03c1m (z)\n\n#1/3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c1m (z) = 2.78 \u00d7 1011 \u03a9m,o (1 + z)3 h2 M\u2299 M pc\u22123 is the\nmean mass density of the universe at redshift z.\nWe estimate the virial mass in the \u039bCDM cosmology\nfor the 63 clusters of the HIFLUGCS sample using Eq. 3;\nthe fit parameters (\u03b2 and rc corrected for a \u039bCDM cosmology) and the temperature T are given in RB02. We have\nsearched in the literature for \u03b2-fit parameters and T of the\nclusters with GRHs (ref. in Tab. 2) in order to estimate\nMv also for these clusters. Since some clusters of the HIFLUGCS sample are also in our sample, we note that in\nthe majority of these cases the fits to the mass profile (and\nT ) given in RB02 leads to a virial mass which is consistent at 1\u03c3 level with the mass derived by making use of the\nparameters obtained from more recent observations in the\nliterature (given in Tabs. 1, 2). The Lx \u2212 Mv distribution of\nthe combined sample is reported in Fig. 4. The presence of\na relatively large dispersion indicates the difficulty in estimating the virial masses of the single objects and confirms\nthe need of large samples in these studies. We note that the\nstatistical distribution of clusters with GRHs is not different\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\n7\n\nfrom that of the HIFLUGCS sample. On the other hand, we\nnote that clusters with known GRHs span a range in mass\ncomparable to the mass\u2013dispersion in the HIFLUGCS sample which is due to the different dynamical status of clusters\nin the sample and to the uncertainties in the measurements.\nThis further strengthens the need of the approach followed\nin this Section, since a Lx (or P1.4 )\u2013Mv fit based on GRHs\nalone would be affected by large uncertainties.\nIn order to better sample the region of higher X-ray\nluminosities and masses (typical of clusters with GRHs), we\ncompute the Lx \u2013Mv fit by combining the HIFLUGCS with\nthe radio\u2013halo sample. The fit has been performed using the\nform:\n\n\u0014\n\nlog\n\nLX\n1044 h\u22121\n70\n\nergs\ns\n\n\u0015\n\n= Af +bf log\n\n\u0010\n\nMv\n(7)\n3.16 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121\n70 M\u2299\n\n\u0011\n\nThe best fit values of the parameters are: Af = \u22120.229 \u00b1\n0.051 and bf = 1.47 \u00b1 0.08 (bf = 1.41 \u00b1 0.10 is obtained with\nHIFLUGCS sample only).\nIn order to derive the P1.4 GHz \u2212 Mv correlation for\nGRHs, we combine Eqs 7 and 1 and find :\nlog\n\nh\n\nP1.4\n3.16 * 1024 h\u22121\n70\n\nW att\nHz\n\n\u2212 (0.814 \u00b1 0.147)\n\ni\n\n= (2.9 \u00b1 0.4) log\n\nh\n\n1015\n\nMv\nh\u22121\n70 M\u2299\n\ni\n\n(8)\n\nOur P1.4 GHz \u2212 Mv correlation is slightly steeper than\nthat obtained with 10 clusters by Feretti (2003) (P1.4 GHz \u221d\nM 2.3 ), which, however, was derived in an EdS cosmology\nby considering the mass within 3 h\u22121\n50 Mpc from the cluster\ncenters, and not the virial mass.\n\n3\n\nFigure 5.

The region of the physical parameters (in particular\nof B) is constrained by comparing the model expected and\nobserved trends of the synchrotron power of GRHs with the\nmass (and temperature) of the parent clusters. As already\ndiscussed (Sec.2) it is unlikely that the observed correlations are driven by selection effects; however, it cannot be\nexcluded that the detailed shape and scatter of these correlations might somewhat change with improved statistics,\nespecially at low X-ray luminosities.\n\n3.1\n\nRadio power\u2013cluster mass correlation\n\nCassano & Brunetti (2005) derived an expected trend between the bolometric radio power, PR , and the virial cluster's mass and/or temperature. In the case of the GRHs,\nthe mergers which mainly contribute to the injection of turbulence in the ICM are those with rs > RH , rs being the\nstripping radius of the infalling sub\u2013cluster (see Sec. 6 in\nCB05). It can be shown that, as a first approximation, the\nexpected scaling PR \u2212 Mv is given by:\nPR \u221d\n\nMv2\u2212\u0393 B 2 ne\n2\n(B 2 + Bcmb\n)2\n\n(9)\n\nFigure 6. Expected slope of the P1.4 \u2212 T correlation as a\nfunction of the magnetic field intensity in a cluster with temperature < T >= 8 keV. The calculations are obtained for\nb=0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1,1.2,1.3,1.5 and 1.7 (from bottom to top);\nT1 = 6 keV and T2 = 10 keV are adopted. The continuous lines\nare for \u0393 \u2243 0.67 and the dashed lines are for \u0393 \u2243 0.56. The two\nhorizontal lines mark the 1 \u03c3 value of the observed slope.\n\n\f8\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\nwhere B is the rms magnetic field strength in the radio\nhalo volume (particle pitch angle isotropitazion is assumed),\nBcmb = 3.2(1 + z)2 \u03bcG is the equivalent magnetic field\nstrength of the CMB and ne is the number density of relativistic electrons in the volume of the GRH. The parameter\n\u0393 is defined by T \u221d M \u0393 ; we consider \u0393 \u2243 2/3 (virial scaling)\nand \u0393 \u2243 0.56 (e.g.; Nevalainen et al. 2000).\nIn this paper we release the assumption adopted in CB05\nof a magnetic field independent of cluster mass and assume\nthat the rms field in the emitting volume scales as B =\nB<M > (M/ < M >)b , with b > 0 and B<M > the value of\nthe rms magnetic field associated to a cluster with mass\nequal to the mean mass < M > of the clusters sample. A\nscaling of the magnetic field intensity with the cluster mass\nis indeed found in numerical cosmological MHD simulations\n(e.g. Dolag et al. 2002, 2004). Dolag et al. (2002) found a\nscaling B \u221d T 2 that would mean B \u221d M 1.33 assuming the\nvirial scaling or B \u221d M 1.12 for \u0393 \u2243 0.56.\nWe assume that the number density of the relativistic electrons in galaxy clusters, ne , does not depend on cluster mass.\nThis is because there is no straightforward physical reason to\nbelieve that this value should scale systematically with Mv ,\nand since only a relatively fast scaling of ne with mass would\nsignificantly affect the radio power \u2013 mass trend (Eq. 9). It\nis indeed more likely that ne may change from cluster to\ncluster, but that the major effect would simply be to drive\nsome scattering on the PR \u2212 Mv trend (Eq. 9).\nGiven these assumptions Eq. 9 becomes:\nPR \u221d\n\n2\n2b\nMv2\u2212\u0393 B<M\n> * (Mv / < M >)\n2\n2\n(B<M > * (Mv / < M >)2 b + Bcmb )2\n\n(10)\n\nwhich has two asymptotic behaviors: PR \u221d Mv2\u2212\u0393+2b for\nB<M > << Bcmb and PR \u221d Mv2\u2212\u0393\u22122b for B<M > >> Bcmb .\nThe observed correlations derived in Sect. 2 involve the\nmonochromatic radio power at 1.4 GHz. How this monochromatic radio power can be scaled to PR depends on the spectrum of radio halos. In the context of particle acceleration\nmodels (e.g., Brunetti et al. 2001, Ohno et al 2002, Kuo et\nal. 2003) the spectrum of radio halos is given by the superposition of spectra emitted from regions in the emitting\nvolume with different magnetic field strenghts. It is expected\nto reach a peack at \u03bdb and then gradually drop as a powerlaw which should further steepen at higher frequencies. The\nbreak frequency can be expressed as a function of the cluster\nmass and of the rms field B in the emitting volume(CB05):\n\u03bdb \u221d M 2\u2212\u0393\n\n(B 2\n\nB \u03b7t2\n2\n+ Bcmb\n)2\n\n(11)\n\nIf we adopt a power-law spectrum extending from the frequency of the peak to a few GHz, P (\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd \u2212a , PR and the\nmonochromatic radio power at a fixed frequency \u03bdo (\u03bdo > \u03bdb )\nscale as P (\u03bdo )/PR \u221d ( \u03bd\u03bdob )a\u22121 . This depends on the cluster\nmass (Eq.11):\nP (\u03bdo )\nMv (a\u22121)(2\u2212\u0393+b)\n\u221d\n\u00012(a\u22121)\nPR\n2\n2b + B 2\nB<M\n> (Mv / < M >)\ncmb\n\n(12)\n\nthus in the case B << Bcmb one has P (\u03bdo )/PR \u221d\nM\n( <M\n)(a\u22121)(2\u2212\u0393+b) , while in the case B >> Bcmb one has\n>\nM\n)(a\u22121)(2\u2212\u0393\u22123b) , which means that for\nP (\u03bdo )/PR \u221d ( <M\n>\nB << Bcmb the P (\u03bdo )\u2212M trend is steeper than the PR \u2212M ,\nwhile the opposite happens in the case B >> Bcmb (the two\n\nTable 3.

On the\nother hand, the trends of P (\u03bdo )/PR with the cluster mass in\nmassive galaxy clusters is rather weak because the observed\nradio spectral index between 327\u20131400 MHz is a \u223c 1.2 (e.g.,\nFeretti 2003) and because B in the most massive objects\nis probably close to Bcmb (Sec.3.3, Fig.7; Govoni & Feretti\n2004). Thus, in order to compare the model expectations\nwith the observations, we will safely assume the same scaling for monochromatic and total radio power.\nIn order to have a prompt comparison with observations we calculate the slope \u03b1M of the P1.4 \u2212 M correlation\nbetween two points as:\n\u03b1M =\n\nlog(P1 /P2 )\nlog(M1 /M2 )\n\n(13)\n\nEq.13 can be compared with the observed slope to constrain\nthe value of the magnetic field and of the slope, b, of the\nscaling between B and the cluster mass. The M1 and M2\nvalues give the representative mass range spanned by the\nbulk of clusters with GRHs, while Bcmb should be calculated\nat the mean redshift of our sample (< z >\u2243 0.19). We point\nout that given B<M > and b, the values of B are fixed for all\nthe values of the masses of the clusters in our sample.\nIn Fig.5 we report the expected slope \u03b1M (Eq. 13) as\na function of B<M > . The different curves are obtained for\ndifferent scaling-laws of the magnetic field with the cluster\nmass (b = 0.5 to 1.7, see caption). Dashed lines refer to\n\u0393 \u2243 0.56 and solid lines to the virial case. The two blue\nhorizontal lines (Fig.5) indicate the range of the observed\nslope (\u03b1M = 2.9 \u00b1 0.4).\nFig. 5 shows that there are values of B<M > and b for which\nthe expected slope is consistent with the observed one. As\na first result we find that with increasing b the values of\nB<M > should increase in order to match the observations\n(for example, b \u223c 0.6 requires B<M > \u223c 0.2 \u2212 1.4 \u03bcG\nwhile b \u223c 1.7 requires B<M > \u223c 2 \u2212 3 \u03bcG). Finally, the\nasymptotic behavior of Eq.10, combined with the observed\ncorrelation (Eq. 8) allows to immediately constrain b: for\nB<M > << Bcmb one has 0.58(0.53) < b < 0.98(0.93) for\nthe virial (non-virial) case, whereas in the case of B<M > >>\nBcmb the model expectations cannot be reconciled with the\nobservations.\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\nFigure 7. The region in the plane (B<M > ,b) allowed from the\nobserved P1.4 \u2212 Mv and P1.4 \u2212 T correlations is reported as a\nshadowed area; < M >= 1.6 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . The dashed line indicate the upper bound of the allowed region obtained considering\nonly the P1.4 \u2212 Mv correlation. The coloured points indicate the\nrelevant configurations of the parameters used in the statistical\ncalculations in Sec.4-6 (Tab. 3). The vertical arrows indicate the\nIC limits on B.\n\n3.2\n\nRadio power\u2013cluster temperature correlation\n\nSince the temperature is related to the cluster mass, the\nradio power \u2013 mass correlation also implies a correlation\nbetween synchrotron radio power and cluster temperature.\nThus, in order to maximize the observational constraints, an\nanalysis similar to that of Sect. 3.1 can also be done for the\nradio power \u2013 temperature correlation (PR \u2212 T ). Combining\nEq. 10 with the M \u2212 T scaling law (T \u221d M 2/3 for the virial\ncase and T \u221d M 0.56 ) one has:\n2\n\nPR \u221d\n\n2\n2 bT\nT \u0393 \u22121 B<M\n> (T / < T >)\n2\n2\n2\nb\n(B<M > * (T / < T >) T + Bcmb\n)2\n\n(14)\n\nwhere bT = b/\u0393 with \u0393 \u2243 2/3 (virial case) or \u0393 \u2243 0.56 (nonvirial case). The asymptotic behaviors of Eq. 14 are given by\nPR \u221d T 2/\u0393\u22121+2bT (B<M > << Bcmb ) and PR \u221d Mv2\u0393\u22121\u22122bT\n(B<M > >> Bcmb ).\nAs in Sec.3.1, here we can adopt the same scaling with T\nfor both PR and P1.4 and compare the values of the expected\nslope with those of the observed one. We can calculate the\nslope \u03b1T of the P1.4 \u2212 T correlation between two points as:\n\u03b1T =\n\nlog(P1 /P2 )\nlog(T1 /T2 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere T1 and T2 define the interval of temperature of our\nsample, < T >= 8 keV is the mean temperature, and Bcmb\nis evaluated at < z >\u2243 0.19. In Fig. 6 we report the slope \u03b1T\nof the P1.4 \u2212T correlation as a function of the magnetic field\nstrength in a average cluster, B<M > . The different curves are\nobtained for different scaling-laws of the cluster magnetic\nfields with mass (i.e., temperature) (b=0.5 to 1.7). Dashed\n\n9\n\nFigure 8.

The calculations are\nreported for the following representative cases: b = 1.7, B<M > =\n3.0\u03bcG (blue points); b = 1.0, B<M > = 1.55\u03bcG (black points);\nb = 0.9, B<M > = 0.18\u03bcG (cyan points) and b = 0.6, B<M > =\n0.2\u03bcG (green points). The bottom shadowed region marks the\nobserved probability for GRHs in the mass bin I while the top\nshadowed region marks that in the mass bin II. The values of the\nobserved probabilities are obtained by combining the results from\nGiovannini et al. 1999, Giovannini & Feretti 2000, and Feretti\n2002. The observed probabilities for the bin I are calculated up\nto z 6 0.15 to minimize the effect due to the incompleteness of\nthe X\u2013ray and radio catalogs used by these authors.\n\nlines are for \u0393 \u2243 0.65 and continuous lines are for the virial\ncase.\nThe horizontal blue lines mark the lower limit \u03b1T \u2243\n4.76 and the upper limit \u03b1T \u2243 8.05 of the observed correlation. Fig. 6 shows that there is a range of values of the\nparameters (B<M > , b) for which the model is consistent with\nthe observed slope. The relevant point is that, similarly to\nthe case of the P1.4 \u2212 M correlations, also in this case values\nof B<M > >> Bcmb cannot be reconciled with observations:\na clear upper boundary at B < 3\u03bcG is obtained for B<M > .\n3.3\n\nConstraining the magnetic field\n\nWe combine the results obtained from the observed correlations (both P1.4 \u2212 Mv and P1.4 \u2212 T ) and the model expected\ntrends to selects the allowed region of the (B<M > , b) parameters. We consider the slope of the P1.4 \u2212 T correlation\n\u03b1T \u2243 6.4 \u00b1 1.64 as derived for the extended sample of 24\ngalaxy clusters with giant and small radio halos. This is because what is important here is the allowed lower bound\nof the values of \u03b1T which does not depend on the adopted\nsample (Sect. 2.2).\nIn Fig.7 we report the region of the plane (B<M > , b) allowed\nby the observed slopes at 1\u03c3 level. The lower bound of the\n(B<M > ,b) region is due to the P1.4 \u2212 Mv correlation while\n\n\f10\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G.

The calculation have been performed assuming: b=1.7, B<M > = 3.0\u03bcG, \u03b7t = 0.2 in both panels.\n\nthe upper bound is mostly due to the P1.4 \u2212 T correlation\nwhich is poorly constrained because of the very large statistical errors. This bound is however also limited by the\nP1.4 \u2212 Mv correlation (Fig.7, dashed line).\n\n(B<M > ,b) inside the constrained region (Fig. 7 coloured\nfilled dots and Tab.3).\n\nAn additional limit on B<M > , also reported in Fig.7\n(vertical arrows), can be obtained from inverse Compton\n(IC) arguments. Indeed a lower bound to the magnetic field\nstrength can be inferred in order to not overproduce, via IC\nscattering of the photons of the CMB radiation, the hard-X\nray excess fluxes observed up to now in a few clusters (e.g.,\nRephaeli & Gruber 2003, Fusco-Femiano et al 2003). In this\ncase the value of the mean magnetic field intensity in the\ncluster volume can be estimated from the ratio between the\nhard-X ray and radio emission. The resulting value of the\nmagnetic field should be considered as a lower limit because\nthe IC emission may come from more external region with\nrespect to the synchrotron emission (e.g., Brunetti et al.\n2001, Kuo et al. 2003, Colafrancesco et al. 2005b) and also\nbecause, in principle, additional mechanisms may contribute\nto the hard-X ray fluxes (e.g., Fusco-Femiano et al. 2003).\nOne of the best studied cases is that of the Coma cluster\nfor which an average magnetic field intensity of the order\nof BIC \u2243 0.2 \u03bcG was derived (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2004).\nAs a first approximation we can use this value to obtain\nthe lower bound of B for each cluster mass from the scaling\nB = B<M > (M/ < M >)b .\n\n4\n\nThe resulting (B<M > ,b) region spans a wide range of\nvalues of B and b. An inspection of Fig.7 immediately identifies two allowed regimes: a super-linear scaling (b > 1) with\nrelatively high values of B and a sub-linear scaling (b < 1)\nwith lower values of B.\nAll the calculations we will report in the following sections are carried out by assuming representative values of\n\n4.1\n\nPROBABILITY TO FORM GIANT RADIO\nHALOS\nProbability of radio halos and constraining \u03b7t\n\nIn this Section we derive the probability with cluster mass to\nfind GRHs in the redshift range z=0\u20130.2. The byproduct of\nthe Section is to calibrate the model by requiring that the\nexpected fraction of cluster with GRHs is consistent with\nthe observational constraints. This allows to select a range\nof values of the parameter \u03b7t , which is the ratio between\nthe energy injected in the form of magnetosonic waves and\nthe P dV work done by the infalling subclusters in passing\nthrough the most massive one. \u03b7t is a free parameter in our\ncalculations since the fraction of the energy which goes into\nthe form of compressible modes is likely to depend on the\ndetails of the driving force.\nIn the conservative case of solenoidal forcing (and beta of\nplasma >> 1) this fraction is expected to scale with M2s Re\n(with Ms < 1, the turbulent Mach number) for M2s Re <\n10 and with a flatter slope for larger values (Bertoglio et al.\n2001). Assuming a Reynolds number (at the injection scale,\ni.e., hundreds of Kpc) in hot and magnetized galaxy clusters\n>103 (see discussion in Lazarian 2006; Brunetti 2006)\nRe \u223c\nand a turbulent energy of the order of \u223c 20% of the thermal\nenergy (CB05), from Fig. 8 in Bertoglio et al. (2001) one\nfinds a reference value \u03b7t \u223c 0.1 which may be even larger in\nthe case of compressible driving.\nRadio halos are identified with those objects in a synthetic cluster population with a synchrotron break frequency\n> 200 MHz in a region of 1 M pc h\u22121\n(Eq.11) \u03bdb \u223c\n50 size. In\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\n11\n\nFigure 10. a) Occurrence of GRHs as a function of the cluster mass in three redshift bins: 0-0.1 (black line),0.2-0.3 (blue line), 0.4-0.5\n(green line). b) Occurrence of GRHs as a function of redshift in two mass bins: [1-2]\u00d71015 M\u2299 (cyan line) and [2-4.5]\u00d71015 M\u2299 (blue\nline). The calculation have been performed assuming: b=0.9, B<M > = 0.2\u03bcG, \u03b7t = 0.42 in both panels.\n\nCB05 it was assumed that the magnetic field in the radio\nhalo volume is independent from the cluster mass and it is\nB \u2243 0.5\u03bcG. Then \u03bdb \u221d M 2\u2212\u0393 and consequently massive clusters are expected to be favourite in forming GRHs.\nCB05 indeed showed that the expected fraction of clusters with GRHs naturally shows an abrupt increase with\ncluster mass, and that the observed fractions (20-30 % for\nM > 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 clusters, 2-5 % for M \u223c 1015 M\u2299 clusters\nand negligible for less massive objects) can be well reconciled\nwith the model expectations by assuming \u03b7t \u223c 0.24 \u2212 0.34.\nIn the present paper we assume that the rms magnetic\nfield depends on the cluster mass and this should affect the\nsynchrotron break frequency (Eq. 11) and the occurrence of\nGRHs with cluster mass. On the other hand, in Sect. 3.3 we\nhave also shown that the comparison between the expected\nand observed trends between radio power and cluster mass\n(and temperature) helps in constraining the range of values\nwhich can be assigned to the magnetic field in clusters.\nThus our calculations of the occurrence of GRHs (z 6 0.2)\nand the selection of the values of \u03b7t necessary to reproduce\nthe observations should be performed within the dashed region in Fig.7.\nTo calculate the expected probabilities to form radio\nhalos we first run a large number, N , of trees for different\ncluster masses at z = 0, ranging from \u223c 5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 to\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . Then we choose different mass bins \u2206M and\nredshift bins \u2206z in which to perform our calculations. Thus,\nfor each mass M , we estimate the formation probability of\nGRHs in the mass bin \u2206M and in the redshift bin \u2206z as\n(CB05):\n\nPN\n\ntj\nj=1 u\nj\n(t + tjd )\nj=1 u\n\n\u2206M, \u2206z\n= PN\nfM\n\n(16)\n\nwhere tu is the time in the redshift interval \u2206z that the\ncluster spends in the mass bin \u2206M with \u03bdb > 200MHz and\ntd is the time that the same cluster spends in \u2206M with\n\u03bdb < 200 MHz. The total probability of formation of GRHs\nin the mass bin \u2206M and in the redshift bin \u2206z is obtained\nby combining all the contributions (Eq. 16) weighted with\nthe present day mass function of clusters given by the Press\n& Schecther mass function.\nTo have a prompt comparison with present observational constraints, we calculate the probability to form\n< 0.2 in the two observed mass bins: bin I\nGRHs at z \u223c\n([0.95 \u2212 1.9] \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 ) and bin II ([1.9 \u2212 3.8] \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 ).\nAs an example, in Fig. 8 we report these probabilities in\nboth bin I and bin II as a function of \u03b7t for three representative cases which nicely sample the region in Fig.7: b = 1.7,\nB<M > = 3.0\u03bcG (blue points); b = 1.0, B<M > = 1.55\u03bcG\n(black points); b = 0.9, B<M > = 0.18\u03bcG (cyan points);\nb = 0.6, B<M > = 0.2\u03bcG (green points).\nThe bottom shadowed region in Fig. 8 marks the observed probability for GRHs in the mass bin I while the top\nshadowed region marks that in the mass bin II. Fig. 8 shows\nthat it is possible to find a range of values of the parameter \u03b7t for which the theoretical expectations are consistent\nwith the observed statistics in both the mass bins. However\nwe note that the requirement in terms of energy of the MS\nmodes increases with decreasing the magnetic field: it goes\nfrom \u03b7t \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.2 for intermediate\u2013large values of B up\nto \u03b7t \u223c 0.5 at the lower bound of the allowed B strengths.\nThe fact that the magnetic field depends on the cluster\nmass is reflected in the different behavior that the various\nselected configurations of parameters may have in Fig. 8 in\nthe two mass bins: one configuration of parameters may be\nfavoured in a mass bin with respect to another configuration\nbut disfavoured in the other mass bin. This is related to the\n\n\f12\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\ntransition from IC dominance (B < Bcmb ) to synchrotron\ndominance (B > Bcmb ) that occurs in going from the bin\nI to the more massive clusters of bin II. In the case of IC\ndominance an increase of B does not significantly affect the\nparticle energy losses, it causes an increase of \u03bdb (Eq.11)\nand thus an increase of the probability to have GRHs. On\nthe other hand, in the case of synchrotron dominance the\nparticle energy losses increase and consequently \u03bdb decreases\n(Eq.11) as well as the probability to form GRHs.\nFor this reason, given \u03b7t , the ratio between the probability to form GRHs in the bin I and in the bin II is expected\nto decrease with increasing b, as larger values of b yield a\nmore rapid increase of B with cluster mass (Fig.8).\nIn Tab.3 we report the maximum and the minimum values of \u03b7t (\u03b7t,max and \u03b7t,min ) for which the model reproduces\nthe observed probabilities (1 \u03c3 limits) in both the mass bins.\nThe results are given for the relevant (B<M > , b) configurations reported in Fig. 7. In agreement with the above discussions, one might notice that in the case of IC dominance\na larger magnetic field implies a smaller energetic request\n(smaller \u03b7t,max ).\n4.2\n\nProbability of radio halos with Mv and\nevolution with z\n\nIn this Section we calculate the expected probability to form\nGRHs with cluster mass without restricting ourselves to the\nmass bins considered by present observations (bin I and bin\nII in Fig. 8) and calculate the evolution of this probability\nwith redshift. In doing these calculations we use the values\nof \u03b7t as constrained in Tab.3 within the region (B<M > ,b) of\nFig.7, and make the viable (and necessary) assumption that\nthe value of \u03b7t (i.e., efficiency of turbulence in going into MS\nmodes) is constant with redshift.\nA detailed calculation of the acceleration efficiency and\nof the probability to have GRHs requires detailed Montecarlo calculations (see Sec. 6 of CB05) essentially because\nat each redshift the acceleration is driven by MS modes injected in the ICM from the mergers that the cluster experienced in the last few Gyr at that redshift. However, to\nreadily understand the model results reported in the following, we may use the simplified formula Eq. (11) which describes the approximate trend of the break frequency with\ncluster mass. The scaling B \u221d M b adopted in this paper\nimplies that the synchrotron losses overcome the IC losses\nfirst in the more massive objects. Clusters of smaller mass\nin our synthetic populations have B << Bcmb and this implies (Eq.11) \u03bdb \u221d M 2\u2212\u0393+b (1 + z)\u22128 so that the probability\nto form GRHs in these clusters increases with the cluster\nmass (2 \u2212 \u0393 + b > 0 always) and decreases with redshift. In\nthe case of more massive clusters the situation may be more\ncomplicated. Indeed for these clusters there is a value of\nthe mass, M\u2217 , for which the cluster magnetic field becomes\nequal to Bcmb . For M > M\u2217 (z) it is \u03bdb \u221d M 2\u2212\u0393\u22123b (Eq. 11)\nand thus the probability to form GRHs would decrease as\nthe mass becomes larger (given the lower bound of the slope\nb as constrained in Fig. 7, it is 2 \u2212 \u0393 \u2212 3b < 0). In these\ncases, at variance with the smaller clusters, the occurrence\nof GRHs with z is only driven by the cosmological evolution\nof the cluster-merger history (which drives the injection of\nturbulence) rather than by the dependence of the IC losses\nwith z (at least up to a redshift for which B \u223c Bcmb (z)). As\n\nEnsslin & Roettgering 2002, z=0\n\nFigure 11. Expected RHLFs at z \u2243 0.05 (coloured lines with\ndots) obtained assuming: b=1.7, B<M > = 3.0\u03bcG (blue lines: \u03b7t =\n0.2 (solid line) and \u03b7t = 0.19 (dashed line)); b=1.7, B<M > =\n2.2\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.2 (magenta line); b=1.5, B<M > = 1.9\u03bcG and\n\u03b7t = 0.2 (red line); b=0.9, B<M > = 0.18\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.39 (cyan\nline); b=0.6, B<M > = 0.2\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.38 (green line); b=1.0,\nB<M > = 0.45\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.33 (black line). For a comparison\nwe report the range of Local RHLF obtained by E&R02 (black\nsolid thick lines).\n\na consequence, the general picture is that going from smaller\nto larger masses, the probability should reach a max value\naround M\u2217 for which B \u223c Bcmb (z), and then it should start\nto smoothly decrease. The value of this mass increases with\nz and depends on the scaling law of B with M. It is:\nM\u2217 (z) \u2243 < M >\n\n\u0012\n\n3.2 (1 + z)2\nB<M > (\u03bcG)\n\n\u00131/b\n\n(17)\n\nIn order to show in some detail this complex behavior\nin the following we analyze two relevant examples.\n\n4.2.1\n\nAn example with super-linear scaling: large B\n\nAs a first example we focus on the case of a super-linear\nscaling. In Fig. 9, we report the occurrence of GRHs as a\nfunction of the cluster mass in three redshift bins (panel\na)) and the occurrence of GRHs as a function of redshift in\ntwo mass bins (panel b)). These calculations have been performed using b = 1.7 and B<M > = 3\u03bcG which are allowed\nfrom the observed correlations. We adopt \u03b7t = 0.2 which is\nin the corresponding range of values obtained in Sec. 5 (see\nTab. 3) in order to reproduce the observed probability of\n< 0.1)\nGRHs at z < 0.2. One finds that at lower redshifts (z \u223c\nthe probability to form GRHs increases with the mass of\n>M\u2217\nthe clusters up to M\u2217 \u223c 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 , while for M \u223c\nsynchrotron losses become dominant and this causes the de>M\u2217 .

Evolution of RHLFs with redshift. The RHLFs are reported from redshifts 0-0.1 to 0.5-0.6 (curves from top to bottom).\nCalculations are developed for: Panel a) b=1.7, B<M > = 3.0 \u03bcG, \u03b7t = 0.2, \u03b1M \u2243 2.5 and Panel b) b=0.9, B<M > = 0.18 \u03bcG, \u03b7t = 0.39,\n\u03b1M \u2243 3.23.\n\nshift with z of the value of the cluster mass at which the\nmaximum of the probability is reached.\nFig.9b shows the occurrence of GRHs with z. In the higher\nmass bin (2 * 1015 6 M 6 4.5 * 1015 ) the occurrence increases up to z \u223c 0.4 and than start to drop. In this very\nmassive clusters the magnetic field is larger than Bcmb (z) at\nany redshift and thus the synchrotron losses are always the\ndominant loss term. The behavior of the probability with\nz in this case is essentially due to the fact that the bulk of\nturbulence in these massive clusters is injected preferentially\nbetween z \u223c 0.2\u22120.5. A different behavior is observed in the\nlower mass bin (1015 6 M 6 2 * 1015 ) where the occurrence\nof GRHs decreases with redshift. This is because clusters\nwith these lower masses have always B < Bcmb (z).\n\n4.2.2\n\nAn example with sub-linear scaling: small B\n\nAs a second example we focus on a sublinear scaling b. In\nFig. 10 we report the occurrence of GRHs as a function of\nthe cluster mass in three redshift bins (panel a)) and the\noccurrence of GRHs as a function of redshift in two mass\nbins (panel b)). The calculations have been performed using\nb = 0.9 and B<M > = 0.2\u03bcG, which are allowed from the\ncorrelations, and adopting a corresponding \u03b7t = 0.42, which\nis within the range of values obtained in Sec. 5 (see Tab. 3)\nin order to reproduce the observed probability of formation\nof GRHs at redshift z < 0.2. In this case at any redshift\nthe probability to form GRHs increases with the mass of\nthe clusters. Indeed the magnetic field in these clusters is\nalways B << Bcmb (z) (for all redshifts and masses) and the\nIC losses are always the dominant loss term. In addition, as\nexpected, in both the considered mass bins the probability\nto form GRHs decreases as a function of redshift, due to the\nincrease of the IC losses (Fig. 10, panel b)).\n\n5\n\nLUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS OF GIANT\nRADIO HALOS\n\nIn this Section we derive the expected luminosity functions\nof giant radio halos (RHLFs). Calculations for the RHLFs\nare carried out within the (B<M > ,b) region of Fig. 7 by\nadopting the corresponding values of \u03b7t which allow to\nmatch the GRH occurrence at z < 0.2. First we use the\n\u2206M\nprobability P\u2206z\nto form GRHs with the cluster's mass to\nestimate the mass functions of GRHs (dNH (z)/dM dV ):\ndNH (z)\ndNcl (z)\n\u2206M\n\u2206M\n=\n\u00d7 P\u2206z\n= nP S \u00d7 P\u2206z\n,\ndM dV\ndM dV\n\n(18)\n\nwhere nP S = nP S (M, z) is the Press & Schechter (1974)\nmass function whose normalization depends essentially by\n\u03c38 (present-day rms density fluctuation on a scale of 8h\u22121\nMpc) and \u03a9o ; we use \u03c38 = 0.9 in a \u03a9o = 0.3 universe. We\nstress that we use nP S since our model is based on the Press\n& Schechter formalism.\nThe RHLF is thus given by:\ndNH (z)\ndNH (z)\n=\ndV dP1.4\ndM dV\n\n\u001e\n\ndP1.4\n.\ndM\n\n(19)\n\ndP1.4 /dM depends on the adopted (B<M > , b) since each\nallowed configuration in Fig. 7 selects a value of the slope of\nP1.4 \u2212 Mv (e.g., Tab. 3) which is consistent (at 1 \u03c3) with the\nvalue of the observed slope obtained with present observations (\u03b1M = 2.9 \u00b1 0.4; see Sec. 3). In particular from Fig. 5\none has that, for a given b, larger values of the magnetic field\nselect smaller values of the slope of the P1.4 \u2212Mv correlation\n(and viceversa).\nIn Fig.11 we report the Local RHLFs (number of GRHs\nper comoving Gpc3 as a function of the radio power) as\nexpected from our calculations. The most interesting feature\nin the RHLFs is the presence of a cut-off/flattening at low\n\n\f14\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\nFigure 13. Expected RHLFs in 6 redshift bins (as reported in the panels). Calculations are performed by using the following values of\nthe parameters : b=1.7, B<M > = 3.0\u03bcG (blue lines: \u03b7t = 0.2 (solid lines) and \u03b7t = 0.19 (dashed lines)); b=1.7, B<M > = 2.2\u03bcG and\n\u03b7t = 0.2 (magenta lines); b=1.5, B<M > = 1.9\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.2 (red lines); b=0.9, B<M > = 0.18\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.39 (cyan lines); b=0.6,\nB<M > = 0.2\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.38 (yellow lines); b=1.0, B<M > = 0.45\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.33 (black lines).\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\nFigure 14. Number of expected GRHs above a given radio flux\nat 1.4 Ghz from a full sky coverage up to z 6 0.2 (the colour\ncode is that of Fig.11). The black points are the data taken from\nGiovannini et al.(1999) and corrected for the incompleteness of\ntheir sky-coverage (\u223c 2 \u03c0 sr).\n\nTo highlight the result, in Fig.11 we also compare our\nRHLFs with the range of Local (RHLF s)E&R (black solid\nlines) reported by Ensslin & R\u00f6ttgering (2002). These\n(RHLF s)E&R are obtained by combining the X-ray luminosity function of clusters with the radio-X-ray correlation\nfor GRHs and assuming that a costant fraction, frh = 1/3,\nof galaxy clusters have GRHs independently from the cluster\nmass (see Ensslin & R\u00f6ttgering 2002).\nThe most important difference between the two expectations\nis indeed that a low-radio power cut-off does not show up in\nthe (RHLF s)E&R in which indeed the bulk of GRHs is expected at very low radio powers. The agreement between the\ntwo Local RHLFs at higher synchrotron powers is essentially\nbecause the derived occurrence of GRHs in massive objects\n(Sect. 4.2) is in line with the fraction, frh = 1/3, adopted\nby Ensslin & R\u00f6ttgering (2002).\nIn Fig. 12 we report the RHLFs expected by our calculations in different redshift bins. The calculations are performed by using two relevant sets of parameters (a super\u2013\nlinear and a sub\u2013linear case as given in the caption of\nFig. 12) allowed from the observed correlations. With increasing redshift the RHLFs decrease due to the evolution\nof the clusters mass function with z and to the evolution of\nthe probability to form GRHs with z.\nFig. 12, allows to readily appreciate the different behavior of the RHLFs in the case of a super-linear scaling of\nB with M, b = 1.7, (Fig. 12, Panel a)) and of a sub-linear\nscaling, b = 0.9 (Fig. 12, Panel b)): the evolution with redshift in the Panel b) (sub\u2013linear case) is faster than that\nin the Panel a) (super\u2013linear case). This difference is driven\nby the probability to form GRHs as a function of redshift\nin the two cases: in the super\u2013linear case the probability to\nform GRHs does not decrease rapidly with z, while a rapid\ndecrease of such a probability is obtained in the sub\u2013linear\ncase (see also Figs. 9, 10 Sect. 6).\nIn Fig. 13 we report the RHLFs obtained by our calculations by adopting the selected set of configurations given\nin Tab. 3 (colour code is the same of Fig. 7). The combination of these configurations define a bundle of expected\nRHLFs which determines the range of the possible RHLFs.\nAll the calculations are performed for the corresponding\nrange of values of \u03b7t which allow to be consistent with the\n< 0.2. One\nobserved probability to form radio halos at z \u223c\nfinds that with increasing redshift the bundle of the RHLFs\nbroadens along the nH (P ) \u00d7 P axis. This is again due to the\ndifferent evolutions of the probability to form GRHs with z\nof the super\u2013linear and sub\u2013linear cases.\n\n6\nFigure 15. Number of expected GRHs from the whole universe\nabove a given radio flux at 1.4 GHz. The colour code is the same\nof Fig.11.\n\nradio powers. This flattening is a unique feature of particle\nacceleration models since it marks the effect of the decrease\nof the efficiency of the particles acceleration (in 1 Mpc h\u22121\n50\ncube) in the case of the less massive galaxy clusters. We\nstress that this result does not depend on the particular\nchoice of the parameters.\n\n15\n\nNUMBER COUNTS OF GIANT RADIO\nHALOS\n\nIn this Section we derive the expected number counts of giant radio halos (RHNCs). This will allow us to perform a\nfirst comparison between the model expectations and the\ncounts of GRHs which can be derived from present observations, but also to derive expectations for future observations.\nAs for the case of the RHLFs, in calculating the RHNCs\nwe adopt the configurations of parameters which allow to\nreproduce the observed probabilities of GRHs at z < 0.2.\nHowever, we point out that the fact that our expectations\nare consistent with the observed probability to form GRHs\n\n\f16\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\nFigure 16. Expected total number of GRHs above a given radio flux in different redshift bins: panel a) above 5 mJy; panel b) above 30\nmJy. In both panels the colour code is the same of Fig.11.\n\n< 0.2 does not imply that they should also be consistent\nat z \u223c\nwith the observed flux distribution of GRHs in the same\nredshift interval.\nGiven the RHLFs (dNH (z)/dP1.4 dV ) the number of\nGRHs with f > f1.4 is given by:\nNH (> f1.4 ) =\n\nZ\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032 (\nz=0\n\ndV\n)\ndz \u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2217 ,z \u2032 )\nP1.4 (f1.4\n\ncounts are in excellent agreement with the counts obtained\nfrom the observations. We note that assuming a superlinear\nscaling of B with cluster mass, up to 30-40 GRHs at z <\n0.2 are expected to be discovered with future deeper radio\nsurveys. On the other hand, the number of these GRHs in\nthe case of a sublinear scaling should only be a factor of \u223c 2\n\u2032\ndNH (P1.4 , z )\ndP1.4 (20) larger than that of presently known halos.\ndP1.4 dV\n\nwhere dV /dz is the comoving volume element in the \u039bCDM\ncosmology (e.g., Carroll, Press and Turner 1992); the radio\nflux and the radio power are related by P1.4 = 4\u03c0 d2L f1.4\nwith dL the luminosity distance (where we neglect the Kcorrection since the slope of the spectrum of radio halos is\nclose to unity).\nAs a first step, we use Eq. 20 to calculate the number\nof expected GRHs above a given radio flux at 1.4 Ghz from\n<0.2 and compare the results\na full sky coverage up to z \u223c\nwith number counts derived by making use of the present\nday observations (Fig. 14, the colour code is that of Fig.11).\nCalculations in Fig. 14 are obtained by using the full bundle\nof RHLFs obtained in the previous Section (Fig. 13). The\nblack points are obtained by making use of the radio data\nfrom the analysis of the radio survey NVSS by Giovannini\net al.(1999); normalization of counts is scaled to correct for\nthe incompleteness due to the sky-coverage in Giovannini et\nal. (\u223c 2 \u03c0 sr). The NVSS has a 1\u03c3 level at 1.4 GHz equal to\n0.45 mJy/beam (beam=45\u00d745 arcsec, Condon et al. 1998).\nBy adopting a typical size of GRH of the order of 1 Mpc, the\nsurface brightness of the objects which populate the peak of\nthe RHLFs (\u223c 1024 W/Hz) at z\u223c0.15 is expected to fall\nbelow the 2\u03c3 limit of the NVSS. These GRHs have a flux\nof about 20 mJy, thus below this flux the NVSS becomes\npoorly efficient in catching the bulk of GRHs in the redshift\nbin z=0\u20130.2 and a fair comparison with observations is not\npossible. For larger fluxes we find that the expected number\n\nAs a second step, we calculate (Fig.15)\nnumber of GRHs expected up z = 0.7 (the\nform GRHs at z > 0.7 is negligible). We\nnumber counts of GRHs increases down to a\n\nthe whole sky\nprobability to\nnote that the\nradio flux\n\nof f1.4 \u223c 2 \u2212 3 mJy and then flattens due to the strong\n(negative) evolution of the RHLFs (Fig. 13). We note that\nthe expected total number of GRHs above 1 mJy at 1.4\nGHz is of the order of \u223c 100 depending on the scaling of\nthe magnetic field with cluster mass.\nFinally we calculate the expected number counts of\nGRHs above a given radio flux in different redshift bins.\nThis allows us to catch the redshift at which the bulk of\nGRHs is expected. In Fig. 16 we report the RHNCs integrated above 5 mJy (Panel a)) and above 30 mJy (Panel\nb)). We note that the bulk of GRHs is expected in the redshift interval 0.1 \u2212 0.3 and this does not strongly depend\non the flux limit. We note that the relatively high value of\nsuch redshift range is also due to the presence of the low\nradio power cut-off in the RHLFs which suppresses the expected number of low power GRHs. On the other hand, at\nradio fluxes > 30 mJy the contribution from higher redshift\ndecreases since the requested radio luminosities at these redshift correspond to masses of the parent clusters which are\nabove the high\u2013mass cut-off of the cluster mass function.\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\n\n17\n\nFigure 17. a) The occurrences of GRHs as a function of the cluster mass in the redshift bins 0-0.1 (solid lines) and 0.4-0.5 (dashed\nlines) are reported for 150 MHz (thick lines) and for 1.4 GHz (thin lines). b) Mass functions of GRHs in the redshift bins 0-0.1 (solid\nlines) and 0.4-0.5 (dashed lines) are reported for 150 MHz (thick lines) and for 1.4 GHz (thin lines). c) Comparison between the expected\nRHNCs above a given radio flux at 1.4 Ghz (thin lines) and at 150 MHz (thick lines) from a full sky coverage up to z 6 0.6.\nAll the calculations have been performed assuming: b=1.5, B<M > = 1.9\u03bcG and \u03b7t = 0.2.\n\n7\n\nTOWARDS LOW RADIO FREQUENCIES:\nMODEL EXPECTATIONS AT 150 MHZ\n\nDue to their steep radio-spectra, GRHs are ideal targets\nfor upcoming low-frequency radio telescopes, such as LOFAR and LWA. In this section we present calculations of\nthe statistics of GRHs at 150 MHz derived from the electron reacceleration model.\nFor simplicity, we present these results only for one set\nof the parameters in the plane (B<M > , b) (Fig.7): a superlinear case (b=1.5, B<M > = 1.9\u03bcG) (see Sec.3).\nFirst, we calculate the probability to have GRHs at\n\u223c 150 MHz as a function of the cluster's mass following\nthe procedure outlined in Sec.4.1 and requiring a break\n>20 MHz to account for the observation frefrequency \u03bdb \u223c\nquency. In Fig.17a we report the probability to have GRHs\nas a function of virial mass in two redshift bins at 1.4 GHz\n(thin lines) and at 150 MHz (thick lines). As expected, the\nprobability at 150 MHz is substantially larger than that calculated at 1.4 GHz, particularly for higher redshifts and for\nlow massive clusters.\nOne of the main findings of our work is the presence\nof a cut-off in the RHLFs at low radio powers (see Sec.5),\nwhich reflects the drop of the probability to form GRHs as\nthe cluster's mass decreases. In Fig.17b we plot the mass\nfunctions of radio halos (RHMFs) at 1.4 GHz and at 150\nMHz in two redshift bins (see caption of Fig.17). We note\nthat the number density of GRHs is increased by only a\nfactor \u223c 2 for M > 2 * 1015 M\u2299 , but by more than one\norder of magnitude for M 6 1015 M\u2299 . The most interesting\nfeature is again the presence of a low mass cut-off in the\nRHMFs at 150 MHz, which however is shifted by a factor\n\u223c 2 towards smaller masses with respect to the case at 1.4\nGHz. This is related to the fact that a smaller energy density\nin the form of turbulence is sufficient to boost GRHs at lower\nfrequencies, and this allows the formation of GRHs also in\nslightly smaller clusters, which indeed are expected to be\nless turbulent (CB05; see also Vazza et al. 2006).\nFinally, in order to obtain estimates for the RHLFs and\n\nRHNCs at 150 MHz, we tentatively assume the same PR \u2212M\nscaling found at 1.4 GHz, scaled at 150 MHz with an average\nspectral index \u03b1\u03bd \u223c 1.2, and follow the approach outlined\nin Secs. 5 and 6. In Fig.17c we report the expected integral\nnumber counts of radio halos from a full sky coverage above\na given radio flux at 1.4 GHz (thin lines) and at 150 MHz\n(thick lines) up to a redshift z \u223c 0.6. The expected number\nof GRHs at 150 MHz are a factor of \u223c 10 larger than the\nnumber expected at 1.4 GHz, with the bulk of GRHs at\nfluxes > few mJy. In the near future LOFAR will be able to\ndetect diffuse emission on Mpc scale at 150 MHz down to\nthese fluxes and this would be sufficient to catch the bulk\nof these GRHs (a more detailed study will be presented in\na forthcoming paper).\n\n8\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe observed correlations between radio and X-ray properties of galaxy clusters provide useful tools to constraining\nthe physical parameters that are relevant to the reacceleration models for the onset of giant radio halos (GRHs). Our\nanalysis is based on the calculations of Cassano & Brunetti\n(2005; CB05), which assumes that a seed population of relativistic electrons reaccelerated by magnetosonic (MS) waves\nis released in the ICM by relatively recent merger events. To\nthis end we have collected from the literature a sample of 17\nGRH clusters for all of which, but one (A2254), both radio\nand X-ray homogeneous data are available, as summarized\nin Tab.1 & 2. Based on the relationships derived in CB05 paper, we have been able to constrain the (likely) dependence\nof the average magnetic field intensity (B) on the cluster\nmass, under the assumption that B can be parameterized\nas B = B<M > (M/ < M >)b (with B<M > the average field\nintensity of a cluster of mean mass < M >= 1.6 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299\nand b positive). This is an important achievement because\nboth the emitted synchrotron spectrum and losses depend\ncritically on the field intensity. Following CB05 approach,\nthe merger events are obtained in the statistical scenario\n\n\f18\n\nR. Cassano, G. Brunetti, G. Setti\n\nprovided by the extended Press & Schechter formalism that\ndescribes the hierarchical formation of galaxy clusters. The\nmain results of our study can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Observed correlations\nIn Sect.2 we derive the correlations between the radio\npower at 1.4 GHz (P1.4 ) and the X-ray luminosity (0.12.4 keV), ICM temperature and cluster mass. Most important for the purpose of the present investigation is the\nP1.4 \u2212 Mv correlation which has been derived by combining the LX \u2212 Mv correlation obtained for a large statistical\nsample of galaxy clusters (the HIFLUGCS sample plus our\nsample) with the P1.4 \u2212LX correlation derived for our sample\nof GRHs. This procedure allows us to avoid the well known\nuncertainties and limits which are introduced in measuring\nthe masses of small samples of galaxy clusters, especially in\nthe case of merging systems. We find a value of the slope\n\u03b1M = 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 (P1.4 \u221d Mv\u03b1M ). A steep correlation of the\nsynchrotron luminosity with the ICM temperature is also\nfound, although with a large statistical error in the determination of the slope : \u03b1T = 6.4 \u00b1 1.6 (P1.4 \u221d T \u03b1T ).\nIn Sec.2 we have also shown that at least in the case\n> 5 * 1044 erg/s) the\nof high X-ray luminosity clusters (LX \u223c\nabove trends are unlikely driven by selection effects in the\npresent observations.\n\u2022 Constraining the magnetic field dependence on the mass\nA correlation between the radio power and the cluster\nvirial mass is naturally expected in the framework of electron\nacceleration models. This relationships, discussed in Sec. 3.1\n(Eq.12), can reproduce the observed correlation for viable\nvalues of the physical parameters. For instance, in the case\nB << Bcmb , it is P (\u03bdo ) \u221d Mv a(2\u2212\u0393+b)+b and the exponent\nagrees with the observed one (\u03b1M \u223c 3) by adopting a typical\nslope of the radio spectrum a = 1 \u2212 1.2 and a sub\u2013linear\nscaling b \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.8.\nA systematic comparison of the expected correlations between the radio power and the cluster mass with the observed one (Sect.3.1 & 2) allows the definition of a permitted region of the parameters' space (B<M > ,b), where a lower\nbound B<M > = 0.2 \u03bcG is obtained in order not to overproduce via the IC scattering of the CMB photons the hard\nX-ray fluxes observed in the direction of a few GRHs (Sect.\n3.3 and Fig.6). It is found a lower bound at b \u223c 0.5\u22120.6 and\nthat a relatively narrow range of B<M > values is allowed for\na fixed b. The boundaries of the allowed region, aside from\nthe lower bound of B<M > , are essentially sensitive to the\nlimits from the P1.4 \u2212 Mv correlation.\nA super\u2013linear scaling of B with mass, as expected by MHD\nsimulations (Dolag et al. 2004) falls within the allowed region.\nThe values of the average magnetic field intensity in the\nsuperlinear case are close (slightly smaller) to those obtained from the Faraday rotation measurements (e.g., Govoni & Feretti 2004), which, however, generally sample regions which are even more internally placed than those\nspanned by GRHs.\nFuture observations will allow to better constrain the\nradio-X ray correlations and thus to better define the region\n\nof the model parameters.\n\u2022 Probability to form GRHs\nIn Sect.4 we report on extensive calculations aimed at\nconstraining \u03b7t , the fraction of the available energy in MS\nwaves, which is required to match the observed occurrence\nof GRHs at redshifts z 6 0.2 (Fig.7). By adopting a representative sampling of the allowed (B<M > ,b) parameter\nspace (Fig.6) we find 0.15 6 \u03b7t 6 0.44: the larger values\nare obtained for B<M > approaching the lower bound of the\nallowed region, because of the larger acceleration efficiency\nnecessary to boost electrons at higher energies to obtain a\nfixed fraction of clusters with GRHs.\nWith an appropriate \u03b7t value for each set of (B<M > ,b)\nparameters we can calculate the probability of occurrence\nof GRHs at larger redshifts for which observational data\nare not available. This probability depends on the merging\nhistory of clusters and on the relative importance of the\nsynchrotron and IC losses, and shows a somewhat complicated behavior with cluster mass and redshift. The maximum value of this probability at a given redshift is found\nfor a cluster mass M\u2217 (Eq.17) which mark the transition between the Compton and the synchrotron dominated phases.\nIn the case of sublinear scaling of the magnetic field with\ncluster mass (b\u223c0.6\u20130.9) the allowed values of the strength\nof the magnetic field are relatively small (Fig. 7), the value\nof M\u2217 is large and the IC losses are always dominant\nfor the mass range of clusters with known GRHs. As a\nconsequence the probability to have GRHs increases with\ncluster mass and decreases with redshift (Fig 10). On\nthe other hand superlinear scalings (b\u223c1.2\u20131.7) imply\nallowed values of B<M > relatively large (Fig. 7), and even\nlarger values of the magnetic field for the most massive\nobjects. In this case the value M\u2217 falls within the range of\nmasses spanned by GRH clusters: the predicted fraction\nof clusters with GRHs increases with mass, then reaches\na maximum value at about Mv \u223c M\u2217 , and finally falls\ndown for larger masses (Fig 9). At variance with the case\nof sublinear scaling, in this case the fraction of the most\nmassive objects with GRHs is expected to slightly increase with redshift, at least up to z=0.2\u20130.4 (Fig 9) where\nthe bulk of turbulence is injected in a \u039bCDM model (CB05).\n\u2022 Luminosity functions (RHLFs)\nIn Sect.5 we report the results of extensive calculations\nfollowing a fair sampling of the (B<M > ,b) allowed region\nas summarized in Tab. 3; this essentially allows a full coverage of all possible RHLFs given the present correlations\nat 1\u03c3. We find that, although the large uncertainties in the\n(B<M > ,b) region, the predicted local RHLFs are confined to\na rather narrow bundle, the most characteristic common feature being the presence of a flattening/cut-off at radio powers below about 1024 W/Hz at 1.4 GHz (Fig.11). The fraction of GRHs with 1.4 GHz luminosity below \u223c 5 \u00d7 1022 W\nHz\u22121 h\u22122\n70 , a factor of \u223c 5 smaller than the luminosity of the\nless powerful GRH (A2256, z=0.0581) known so far, is negligible. This characteristic shape of the RHLFs, obtained in\nour paper for the first time, represents a unique prediction\nof particle acceleration models, and does not depend on the\nadopted physical details for the particle acceleration mecha-\n\n\fStatistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models\nnism. This is due to the decrease of the efficiency of particle\nacceleration in the case of less massive clusters which is related to three major reasons (see CB05):\ni) smaller clusters are less turbulent than larger ones\nsince the turbulent energy is expected to scale with the\nthermal one (CB05; see also Vazza et al. 2006);\nii) turbulence is typically injected in large Mpc regions\nin more massive clusters and thus these are favoured for\nthe formation of GRHs (CB05);\niii) since in the present paper we found B \u221d M b with\n> 0.5, higher energy electrons should be accelerated in\nb\u223c\nsmaller clusters to emit synchrotron radiation at a given\nfrequency.\nDeep radio survey with future radio telescopes (LOFAR,\nLWA, SKA) are required to test the presence of this cutoff/flattening in the luminosity function of the GRHs.\nThe predicted evolution of the RHLFs with redshift is\nillustrated in Fig. 13: the comoving number density of\nGRHs decreases with redshift due to the evolutions of the\ncluster mass function and of the probability to form GRHs.\nThe decrease with redshift of the RHLFs calculated by\nadopting sublinear scaling of the magnetic field with cluster\nmass is faster than that in the superlinear scaling causing a\nspread in the RHLFs bundle with z.\n\u2022 Number counts (RHNCs)\nIn Sec.7 we have derived the integral number counts of\nGRHs at 1.4 GHz. We find that the number counts predicted\nfor the same set of RHLFs discussed in Secs.6 generally agree\nwith those derived from the NVSS at the limit of this survey\nand within z = 0.2 (Fig.14). The flattening of the counts\nbelow \u223c 50 \u2212 60 mJy is both due to the combination of the\nlow power cut-offs of the RHLFs with the redshift limit, and\nto the RHLFs evolution with redshift. On the other hand,\npast calculations which assume a fixed fraction of GRHs\nwith cluster mass predict an increasing number of sources\nat lower fluxes (e.g., Ensslin & R\u00f6ttgering, 2002).\nGRHs around the peak of our LFs (P1.4GHz \u223c 1024 W/Hz)\nand at z\u223c0.15 would be detectable at fluxes below about\n20 mJy, which however is below the sensitivity limit of the\nNVSS for this type of objects. We estimate that the number\nof GRHs below this flux could be up to 30-40 (whole sky,\nz 6 0.2) if superlinear scalings of the mass with B hold.\nThe predicted number of GRHs (Fig.15) (whole Universe)\n>100 if a superlinear scaling of the mass with\ncould be up to \u223c\nB holds, while a sublinear scaling would give a number 2-3\ntimes smaller. A substantial number of these objects would\nbe found also down to a flux of a few mJy at 1.4 GHz in the\ncase of a superlinear scaling, while in the case of sublinear\nscalings the number of GRHs below about 10 mJy would be\nnegligible.\nWe also find that the bulk of GRHs is expected at\nz \u223c0.1\u20130.3 (Fig.16). It should be mainly composed by those\nRHs populating the peak of the RHLFs, i.e. objects similar\n(or slightly more powerful) to the GRH in the Coma cluster.\n\u2022 Toward expectations at low radio frequencies\nIn Sec.7 we have extended our estimates to the case of\nlow frequency observations which will be made with upcom-\n\n19\n\ning instruments, such as LOFAR and LWA. Lower energetic\nelectrons contribute to these frequencies and thus - in the\nframework of the particle re-acceleration scenario - the efficiency of producing GRHs in galaxy clusters is expected to\nbe higher than that of GRHs emitting at 1.4 GHz.\nBy presenting the analysis for a representative set of parameters, we have shown that the probability to have GRHs\nemitting at 150 MHz is significantly larger than that of\nthose emitting at 1.4 GHz, particularly in the mass range\n\u223c 5 * 1014 \u2212 1.5 * 1015 M\u2299 . Consequently, the low mass cutoff in the RHMFs is shifted down by a factor of \u223c 2. This\nis naturally expected and is due to the fact that slightly\nless turbulent systems are able to generate GRHs at lower\nfrequencies.\nWe have also estimated that the number counts of GRHs\nat low frequencies might outnumber those at 1.4 GHz by\nat least one order of magnitude. We venture to predict that\n>103 (all sky) GRHs down to a\nLOFAR is likely to discover \u223c\nflux of few mJy at 150 MHz.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nRC warmly thank S.Ettori and C.Lari for useful discussions\non the statistical analysis.
