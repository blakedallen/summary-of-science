Many proposals have\nbeen made to reconcile the data and theoretical predictions. In this paper\nwe study these decays within the SM using flavor U(3) symmetry. If small\nannihilation amplitudes are neglected, one needs 11 hadronic parameters to\ndescribe B \u2192 P P decays where P can be one of the \u03c0, K, \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 nonet\nmesons. We find that existing data are consistent with SM with flavor U(3)\nsymmetry. We also predict several measurable branching ratios and CP asymmetries for B \u2192 K(\u03c0)\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ), \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 )\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) decays. Near future experiments can\nprovide important tests for the Standard Model with flavor U(3) symmetry.\n\n1\n\n\fExperimental data from CLEO, BaBar and Belle [1\u20134] have measured branching ratios\nof B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 around 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 which are substantially larger than theoretical calculations\nbased on naive factorization approximation in the Standard Model (SM) [5]. Although there\nare some improvements in calculating the branching ratios in the last few years by using\nQCD improved factorization method [6], there are still large uncertainties in calculating the\nbranching ratios for B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 because of issues related to \u03b71 \u2212 \u03b78 mixing and QCD anomaly\nassociated with \u03b71 . There are also many speculations about possible new physics beyond the\nSM in these decays [7]. Before any claim can be made about new physics, one must study\nthe SM contributions in all possible ways to see if it is really inconsistent with experimental\ndata.\nIn this paper we carry out a systematic study of B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 , and more generally processes\nof B \u2192 P P decays with at least one of the P to be \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) in the final states by using\nflavor symmetry in the SM. This way one can relate different decays to predict unmeasured\nbranching ratios and CP asymmetries. Drastic deviations between the predicted relations\nand experimental data can provide information about the SM and models beyond. Similar\nconsiderations based on SU(3) have been applied to B \u2192 P P decays [8], and shown to be\nconsistent with data [9]. If one sticks to flavor SU(3) symmetry, one needs to introduce the\nsinglet \u03b71 in the theory and to add additional amplitudes to describe new decay modes [10].\nOne may also consider to promote the flavor SU(3) symmetry to flavor U(3) symmetry such\nthat \u03b71 is automatically included in the theory.\nFlavor U(3) symmetry has been studied in Kaon decays. There there are non-negligible\nsymmetry breaking effects. For B decays one may also expect symmetry breaking effects\nto exist. There are also some studies of U(3) symmetry for B decays [11]. Present data,\nhowever, are not able to make clear statement about whether this symmetry is badly broken.\nIn this paper we will take the flavor U(3) symmetry as working hypothesis and to study\nwhether experimental data can be explained by carrying out a systematic analysis. We find\nthat the SM with flavor U(3) symmetry can explain all existing data, in particular can obtain\nlarge branching ratios for B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 decays. We also predict some unmeasured branching\n2\n\n\fratios and CP asymmetries which can be used to further test the theory.\nThe quark level effective Hamiltonian can be written as [12]\nq\nHef\nf\n\n11\nX\nGF\n\u2217 uc\n\u2217\n\u221a\n=\nci + Vtb Vtq\u2217 ctc\n[Vub Vuq (c1 O1 + c2 O2 ) \u2212 (Vub Vuq\ni )Oi ].\n2\ni=3\n\n(1)\n\nHere Vij are KM matrix elements. The coefficients c1,2 and cjk\ni are the Wilson Coefficients\nwhich have been evaluated by several groups [12] with |c1,2 | >> |cjk\ni |. Oi are operators\nconsist of quarks and gluons.\nThe B \u2192 P P decay amplitudes can be parameterized as\nGF\nq\n\u2217\n\u2217\nA(B \u2192 P P ) =< P P |Hef\nf |B >= \u221a [Vub Vuq T + Vtb Vtq P ],\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere B = (Bu , Bd , Bs ) = (B \u2212 , B\u0304 0 , B\u0304s0 ) which form a fundamental representation of\nSU(3) (or (U(3)). The amplitudes T and P are related to the hadronic matrix elements\n< P P |Oi|B > which are very difficult to calculate. For our purpose, however, we only\nneed to know the fact that under SU(3) (or U(3)) O1,2 , O3\u22126,11 , and O7\u221210 transform as\n3\u0304 + 3\u0304\u2032 + 6 + 15, 3\u0304, and 3\u0304 + 3\u0304\u2032 + 6 + 15, respectively [8], and to parameterize the amplitudes\naccording to SU(3) (or U(3)) invariant amplitudes to be discussed below.\nAs mentioned earlier that there are two approaches to the problem from flavor symmetry\npoint of view. We first work with the U(3) symmetry approach. In this case, the \u03c0, K, \u03b78\nand \u03b71 form a nonet representation of U(3), Mji , with\n\uf8eb\n\n(Mij ) =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03c00\n\u221a\n2\n\n+\n\n\u03b78\n\u221a\n6\n\n\u03c0\n\n+\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\n\u03c0\n+\n\u2212\u221a\n2\n\nK\u2212\n\nK\u0304 0\n\nK\n\u03b78\n\u221a\n6\n\n+\n\nK0\n\u22122 \u221a\u03b786\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7+\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\n\u221a1 \u03b71\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221a1 \u03b71\n3\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221a1 \u03b71\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nOne can write the T amplitude for B \u2192 P P in terms of the flavor U(3) invariant\namplitudes as\nT = AT3\u0304 Bi H(3\u0304)i (Mlk Mkl ) + C3\u0304T Bi Mki Mjk H(3\u0304)j\njk\nl\nk\nT\ni\nl\n+ \u00c3T6 Bi H(6)ij\nk Mj Ml + C\u03036 Bi Mj H(6)l Mk\njk\ni\nl\nk\nT\nl\nT\nBi H(15)ij\n+ A15\nk Mj Ml + C15 Bi Mj H(15)l Mk\n\n3\n\n\fk\nl\n+ B3\u0304T Bi H(3\u0304)i Mjj Mkk + B\u03036T Bi H(6)ij\nk Mj Ml\nk\nl\nT\ni\nj\nl\nT\n+ B15\nBi H(15)ij\nk Mj Ml + D3\u0304 Bi Mj H(3\u0304) Ml .\n\n(3)\n\nIn Table I we list all decay amplitudes involving \u03b71,8 . The amplitudes containing only K\nand \u03c0 in the final states can be found in Ref. [9]. There are a few new features for the U(3)\namplitudes in eq. (3) compared with the SU(3) amplitudes for B \u2192 P P . The last four terms\nare new. In SU(3) case because the traceless condition of Mij , these terms are automatically\nzero. With SU(3) symmetry, the amplitudes \u00c36 and C\u03036 always appear in the combination\nof C\u03036 \u2212 \u00c36 [8]. This degeneracy is, naively lifted in processes with \u03b71 in the final states. It\nseems that there is the need of having both C\u03036 and \u00c36 to describe the decays increasing the\ntotal number of hadronic parameters by one. However, this is not true since that the \u00c3T6\nand C\u03036T terms in decay modes with \u03b71 in the final state can be written as C6T = C\u03036T \u2212 \u00c3T6 ,\nand the additional \u00c3T6 be absorbed by redefining the amplitude B6T = B\u03036T + \u00c3T6 . In Table\nI we therefore have listed the decay amplitudes in terms of the independent U(3) invariant\nT\nT\n, AT3\u0304,15 , B3\u0304,6,15\nand D3\u0304T .\namplitudes, C3\u0304,6,15\n\nWe now describe the other approach to include \u03b71 in B \u2192 P P decays.

It is interesting to note that both approaches discussed above introduce the\nsame number of new parameters, four of them, into the theory. In our analysis we will work\nwith the flavor U(3) symmetry.\n4\n\n\fTo obtain the amplitudes for B decays with at least one \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) in the final states, one also\nneeds to consider \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing,\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03b7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\ncos\u03b8 \u2212sin\u03b8 \uf8f7 \uf8ec \u03b78 \uf8f7\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8\n\n\u03b71\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThe average value of the mixing angle \u03b8 is \u221215.5\u25e6 \u00b1 1.3 \u25e6 [13]. We will use \u03b8 = \u221215.5\u25e6 in\nour fit.\nThere are similar U(3) invariant amplitudes for the penguin contributions. We indicate\nP\nP\nP\nthem as C3\u0304,6,15\n, AP3\u0304,15 , B3\u0304,6,15\nand D3\u0304,6,15\n. The amplitudes Ai and Bi are referred as annihila-\n\ntion amplitudes because the B mesons are first annihilated by the interaction Hamiltonian\nand two light mesons are then created. In total there are 22 complex hadronic parameters (44 real parameters with one of them to be an overall unphysical phase).

We have checked with different renormalization schemes and find that numerically\nthe changes are less than 15% for different schemes. In obtaining the above relations, we\nhave also neglected small contributions from c7,8 which cause less than 1% deviations.\nUsing the above relations the number of independent hadronic parameters are reduced\nT,P\nT,P\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nwhich we choose to be, C3\u0304T,P (AT,P\n3\u0304 ), C6 , C15 (A15 ), B3\u0304 , B6\u0304 , B15 , D3\u0304 .

It\nis tempting to use experimental data to fix all the hadronic parameters described earlier.\nIt has been shown that if processes involving \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032) are not included, it is indeed possible\nto determine all the SU(3) invariant amplitudes, Ai and Ci [8]. When processes involving\n\u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) are also included, a meaningful determination of all hadronic parameters (25 of them)\n6\n\n\fis, however, not possible at present because of too many parameters. We therefore in the\nfollowing neglect the annihilation amplitudes, which are anticipated to be small, to see if all\ndata can be reasonably explained, in particular to see if large B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 branching ratios can\nbe obtained, with only 11 parameters given in eq. (8). This is a nontrivial task. Remarkably\nwe find that all data can, indeed, be well explained.\nWe use the averaged CLEO, BaBar and Belle data [2\u20134] shown in Table III and IV to\nfix the unknown 11 hadronic parameters by carrying out a global \u03c72 analysis. The results\nare shown in Table II. In our analysis due to the lack of knowledge of the error correlations\nfrom experiments, in obtaining the averaged error bars, we have, for simplicity, taken them\nto be uncorrelated and assumed to obey Gaussian distribution taking the larger one between\n\u03c3+ and \u03c3\u2212 to be on the conservative side. Experimental data on \u01ebK , B \u2212 B\u0304 mixing, |Vcb |,\n|Vub /Vcb|, and sin 2\u03b2 provide very stringent constraints on the KM matrix elements involved\nin our analysis [9,14,15]. We have treated them in our analysis as known parameters with\nthe values \u03bb = 0.2196, A = 0.854, \u03c1 = 0.25 and \u03b7 = 0.34 (\u03b3 = 53.4\u25e6 ) determined from the\nmost recent data.\nUsing the above determined hadronic parameters, we study several other unmeasured\nbranching ratios and CP violating rate asymmetries ACP for B \u2192 P P defined by,\nACP =\n\n\u0393(Bi \u2192 P P ) \u2212 \u0393(B\u0304i \u2192 P\u0304 P\u0304 )\n.\n\u0393(Bi \u2192 P P ) + \u0393(B\u0304i \u2192 P\u0304 P\u0304 )\n\n(9)\n\nThe results are shown in Tables III and IV.\nWe now discuss some implications of the results obtained and draw conclusions. We see\nfrom Tables III and IV that the best fit values for the known branching ratios are in good\nagreements with data, in particular large B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 can be obtained. The minimal \u03c72 in our\nfit is 16 with total of 23 data points from B \u2192 P P decays and the 11 hadronic parameters\nin eq.(8) as fitting parameters. The value of 1.33 for the \u03c72 per degree of freedom represents\na reasonable fit. In our fit the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing parameter \u03b8 is fixed at the average value\ndetermined from other data [13]. We checked the sensitivity of the final results on \u03b8 within\nthe allowed region and find the changes are small. We also find that if one reduces the U(3)\n7\n\n\fTABLE II.

This indicates that the parameters\nCi are stable when promoting SU(3) to U(3). The large branching ratios for B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 are\ndue to the new parameters D3\u0304 . The U(3) assumption can provide a good approximation for\nB \u2192 P P decays. The Standard Model with flavor U(3) symmetry is not in conflict with\nexisting data.\nIn our fit, we did not include the branching ratios which only have information on their\nupper bounds, such as Br(Bd \u2192 K \u2212 K + ), Br(Bd \u2192 K\u0304 0 K 0 ) and Br(Bu \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 ).

These are particularly difficult to estimate from theoretical calculations because\nthese amplitudes may be related to QCD anomalies. Also in factorization approach, it is\nnot possible to reliably calculate the phases in the hadronic parameters. In our fit, we find\nthat these phases can be sizeable. Further improved theoretical method is needed to have a\nbetter understanding of B \u2192 P P decays.\nUsing the hadronic parameters determined from existing data, we have predicted several\nunmeasured branching ratios. These predictions can be used to test the theory. There are\nsix modes involving at least one \u03b7 (or a \u03b7 \u2032 ) in the final states for Bd decays. Among them\nBd \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 has the largest branching ratio, it is a clear test for the theory. The other\nmodes are also in the reach of near future data from B-factories. There are also seven Bs\ndecay modes with at least one \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 in the final states. Several of the branching ratios\nare predicted to be large, in particular the predicted branching ratio for Bs \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 is about\n7 \u00d7 10\u22125 which can be measured at future hadron colliders and can provide another crucial\ntest for theory.\nWe have also obtained interesting predictions for CP asymmetries in B \u2192 P P decay\nmodes. Many of the predicted central values for the CP asymmetries are larger than 10%\nwhich can be measured in the near future. These modes can provide important information\nabout CP violation in the Standard Model.\nIn conclusion, we have carried out an systematic analysis for B \u2192 P P decays in the SM\nwith flavor U(3) symmetry. This approach allows one to study B decays involving at least\none \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 in the final states. We find that all existing data can be explained, in particular\nlarge branching ratios for B \u2192 K\u03b7 \u2032 are possible. There is no conflict between the Standard\nModel and present experimental data. We have also predicted several unmeasured branching\nratios and CP asymmetries within the reach of near future B-factories. Future experimental\ndata will provide crucial information on flavor symmetries and also the Standard Model.\n\n11\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] B. Behrens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 3710(1998); T.
