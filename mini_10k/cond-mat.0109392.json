In the one-loop flow at the van\nHove filling, the characteristic temperature for the flow to strong coupling is suppressed drastically\naround t\u2032c \u2248 \u22120.33t, suggesting a quantum critical point between d-wave pairing at moderate t\u2032 > t\u2032c\nand ferromagnetism for t\u2032 < t\u2032c . Upon increasing the particle density in the latter regime the leading\ninstability occurs in the triplet pairing channel.\nPACS numbers: 74.20.Mn, 74.20.Rp, 75.10.Lp\n\nIn recent years the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard\nmodel has mainly served as an idealized model in the\nefforts to understand the Mott-insulating, antiferromagnetic (AF), superconducting (SC) and more exotic properties of the high-Tc cuprates, like the pseudo-gap or\nstripe phases. While the latter phenomena are still under\ncurrent debate and the Mott-insulating state is generically restricted to larger onsite repulsion U , the AF and\nd-wave SC ground states in the Hubbard model can be\nunderstood, at least qualitatively, by calculations at weak\nor moderate U . Here, besides diagrammatic approaches\ntaking into account subclasses of diagrams, like ladder\nsummations [1] and the fluctuation-exchange approximation [2], one-loop renormalization group (RG) methods\nrestricted to the saddle point regions [3,4] and more recently taking into account the whole Fermi surface [5\u20137]\nhave become a popular method to study the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in the Hubbard\nmodel. They indicate that for small nearest-neighbor\nhopping t\u2032 and close to half-filling, the weakly coupled\nstate is unstable with respect to AF fluctuations, while\nat smaller or larger electron densities the RG flow exhibits a Cooper instability in the dx2 \u2212y2 -wave channel\n[6]. For t\u2032 \u2248 \u22120.25t to \u22120.3t on the hole-doped side,\nthe change from AF to d-wave instability leads over an\nintermediate regime, the saddle point regime of Ref. [7].\nOriginally the Hubbard model was introduced by Hubbard, Gutzwiller, and Kanamori with a somewhat different motivation, namely as a model to describe the metallic ferromagnetism in the transition metals [10,11]. Since\nthen several attempts have been undertaken to clarify the\nconditions for itinerant ferromagnetism within the Hubbard model and related systems. For several classes of\none-dimensional [11] and higher-dimensional [12] models, spin polarized ground states can be proven to exist, and also in the limit of infinite dimensions a number\nof clear results exist [13,10]. For the 2D t-t\u2032 Hubbard\nmodel at large U Becca and Sorella [14] recently found\n\nnumerical evidence for a Nagaoka phase close to halffilling. At weak to moderate U however the situation is\nmore involved. Hartree-Fock treatments [15] and more\nrecently T -matrix approximation calculations combined\nwith Quantum Monte Carlo [16] and parquet approaches\n[17] indicated that for larger absolute values of the nextnearest neighbor hopping t\u2032 the ground state should be\nferromagnetic (FM) in a certain density range around the\nvan Hove-filling where the Fermi surface (FS) is near the\nsaddle points of the band dispersion. A one-loop scaling\nanalysis restricted to the saddle-point regions indicated\nsimilar tendencies [4]. Nonetheless, one-loop RG calculations [5\u20137] derived from exact RG equations and covering the full FS have so far not indicated any FM ground\nstates. Moreover the competition between FM and SC\nground states remains an open problem.\nIn this Letter we reinvestigate possible instabilities of\nthe 2D t-t\u2032 Hubbard model towards magnetic and superconducting phases from the weak-coupling perspective.\nThe microscopic Hamiltonian we study is\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nX\nH = \u2212t\nni\u2191 ni\u2193\nci,s cj,s \u2212 t\u2032\nci,s cj,s + U\nn.n., s\n\nn.n.n., s\n\ni\n\nwith onsite repulsion U and hopping amplitudes t and t\u2032\nbetween nearest neighbors (n.n.) and next-nearest neighbors (n.n.n.) on the 2D square lattice. We apply a novel\none-loop RG scheme covering the full FS which we call\nthe temperature-flow (T -flow) RG scheme. Like the approaches in Refs. [5\u20138] it is derived from an exact RG\nequation. However, no infrared cutoff is used, and instead the temperature T itself is the flow parameter. This\nnew feature allows for the first time an unbiased comparison between AF and FM tendencies, whereas RG\nschemes with a flowing infrared cutoff artificially suppress particle-hole excitations with low wavevectors. A\ndetailed discussion of this issue and a derivation of the\nT -flow RG equations are given in Ref. [9]. Using the\nRG formalism, we obtain a hierarchy of differential equa1\n\n\ftions for the one-particle irreducible n-point vertex func(n)\ntions \u0393T as functions of the temperature. Integration\nof this system gives the T -flow. We pose the initial\ncondition that at a higher temperature T0 the singleparticle Green's function of the system is described by\nG0 (i\u03c9, ~k) = [i\u03c9 \u2212 \u01eb(~k)]\u22121 and the interaction vertex is\ngiven by a local repulsion U . This is justified if T0 is\nlarge enough. We truncate the infinite system of equa(n)\ntions by dropping all \u0393T with n > 4. In the present\ntreatment we also neglect selfenergy corrections and the\nfrequency dependence of the vertex functions. This restricts the scheme to a one\u2013loop equation for the spin(4)\nrotation invariant four-point vertex \u0393T . Starting with\n(4)\nweak to moderate interactions, we follow the flow of \u0393T\nas T decreases.\n(4)\n\u0393T is determined by a coupling function VT (~k1 , ~k2 ,\n~k3 ) [7\u20139]. For the numerical treatment, we define elongated phase space patches around lines leading from the\norigin of the BZ to the (\u00b1\u03c0, \u00b1\u03c0)-points, and approximate VT (~k1 , ~k2 , ~k3 ) by a constant for all wave vectors\nin the same patch. We calculate the RG flow for the\nsubset of interaction vertices with one wavevector on\nthe FS representative for each patch, with initial condition VT0 (~k1 , ~k2 , ~k3 ) = U . Most calculations were performed using 48 patches. Further we calculate several\nstatic susceptibilities, as described in Ref. [7]. Here we\nfocus on the most divergent ones, namely dx2 \u2212y2 -wave\nand p-wave pairing susceptibilities, the AF susceptibility\n\u03c7s (~q = (\u03c0, \u03c0)) and the FM susceptibility \u03c7s (~\nq \u2192 0). This\nway we analyze which classes of coupling functions and\nwhich susceptibilities become important at low T . For a\nlarge parameter range, we observe a flow to strong coupling. The approximations mentioned above fail when\nthe couplings get too large. Therefore we stop the flow\nwhen the largest coupling exceeds a high value larger\nthan the bandwidth, e.g. VT,max = 18t. This defines a\ncharacteristic temperature Tc of the flow to strong coupling. Because breaking of continuous symmetries is impossible in 2D at T > 0, we interpret Tc as an estimate\nfor the temperature where ordering occurs when a small\nadditional coupling in the third spatial direction is included.\nHere we describe the results for the RG flow of the\ncoupling function for the 2D Hubbard model with initial\ninteraction U = 3t and varying value for the next-nearest\nneighbor hopping t\u2032 . The chemical potential is fixed [18]\nat the van Hove (VH) value \u03bc = 4t\u2032 so that the FS always\ncontains the saddle points at (\u00b1\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u00b1\u03c0).\nWe decrease t\u2032 from 0 to more and more negative values. The overall behavior of the flow to strong coupling\nis shown in Fig. 1. Focusing on AF, d-wave and FM susceptibilities, we observe three distinct parameter regions\nwith typical FS shown in Fig. 2. The first regime is closer\nto half-filling, where t\u2032 > \u22120.2t. Here Tc is relatively high\nand the AF susceptibility grows most strongly (see Fig.\n\n2). The dominant scattering processes are AF processes\nbetween FS parts connected by wavevectors \u2248 (\u03c0, \u03c0).\nWhen we further decrease t\u2032 , Tc drops continuously, and\nfor t\u2032 < \u22120.2t, the d-wave susceptibility takes over as the\nleading susceptibility. For t\u2032 \u2248 \u22120.25t and band fillings\nslightly larger than the VH filling we again find a regime\nwhere the flow of d-wave SC and AF processes is strongly\ncoupled. This is the saddle point regime studied in Ref.\n[7]. Here we focus on the flow when we go to even more\nnegative t\u2032 and at the same time adjust the chemical potential such that the FS stays at the saddle points. Then\nTc drops by several orders of magnitude for t\u2032 \u2264 \u22120.3t,\nwhile for t\u2032 \u2264 \u22120.33t it rises again. For these values\nthe flow to strong coupling is dominated by processes\nwith small momentum transfer and the FM susceptibility \u03c7s (~q = 0) is by far the most divergent susceptibility\nat low temperatures (right plot in Fig. 2; note that the\nFM susceptibility dominates already at a higher T , where\nthe largest couplings are still well within the bandwidth.\nThe overall behavior strongly suggests a quantum critical\npoint around t\u2032c \u2248 \u22120.33t where the ground state changes\nfrom d-wave singlet SC to FM.\n0\n\n10\n\nAF dominated\nd\u2212wave\ndominated\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\nTc / t\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\nFM\ndominated\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0.3\n\u2212t' / t\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 1.\nThe characteristic temperature for the flow to\nstrong coupling, Tc , versus next nearest neighbor hopping amplitude t\u2032 from a 48-patch calculation (the crosses show data\nfor 96 patches). The chemical potential is fixed at the van\nHove value \u03bc = 4t\u2032 . Tc is defined as temperature where the\ncouplings reach values larger than 18t. As criterion for the distinction between antiferromagnetic, dx2 \u2212y 2 -wave pairing and\nferromagnetic regime we use the temperature derivatives of\nthe susceptibilities at the scale where the couplings become\nlarger than 10t.\n\nLin and Hirsch [15] analyzed the Hartree-Fock phase\ndiagram for the t-t\u2032 Hubbard model and found the FM\nstate to be stable against the AF state for t\u2032 < \u22120.324t.\nSince they used the bare Hubbard repulsion, the dx2 \u2212y2 wave phase is absent. The critical t\u2032 -value from HartreeFock is practically equivalent to the critical t\u2032c \u2248 \u22120.33t\nfrom the RG treatment. On the other hand in HartreeFock one would find a first order transition at t\u2032c , while in\nthe RG the characteristic temperature gets suppressed to\nlowest values, hinting at a quantum critical point.

This\nproperty is shared by the 2D t-t\u2032 Hubbard model for t\u2032 \u2248\n\u22120.5t, but at the van Hove filling, the DOS is also peaked\nat the Fermi level. In our RG calculation the DOS at the\nFermi level, and not that at the bottom of the band,\nis essential for the FM tendencies: they also exist, and\ndominate, for smaller |t\u2032 | in the range described above,\nand they are strongly reduced when the Fermi level is\nraised above the VH energy (see below). This sensitivity\nof the FM regime to the FS location points to another\neffect which is not included in the present calculation. It\nis probable that the inclusion of selfenergy effects in the\nflow will shift the FS and alter the low energy DOS such\nthat the actual FM regime might be shifted, or changed\nmore strongly. The analysis of these effects is left for\nfuture work.\n\n0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2\nT/t\n\nFIG. 2. Flow of the AF (dashed line), d-wave pairing (solid\nline) and FM (dotted line) susceptibilities in the AF nesting\nregime (left plot, \u03bc = \u22120.01t), d-wave regime (middle plot,\n\u03bc = \u2212t) and FM regime (right plot, \u03bc = \u22121.8t). The crosses\n(triangles) on the horizontal axes denote the temperatures\nwhere the largest couplings reach 5t (10t). The insets show\nthe Fermi surfaces and the 48 points in the Brillouin zone for\nwhich the coupling function is calculated.\n\nNext we investigate the flow to strong coupling for\ndensities away from the VH filling. The RG flow for\nsmaller |t\u2032 | is very similar to the flow found with the\nmomentum-shell techniques which has been extensively\ndiscussed in Refs. [5\u20137]. Therefore we now focus on the\ncase t\u2032 < \u22120.33t corresponding to the FM regime at the\nVH filling and search for SC tendencies when the band\nfilling is varied. In the 2D Hubbard model the occurrence\nof triplet pairing in vicinity of a FM phase has been pro-\n\n3\n\nposed by several authors [16,20]. Our approach allows a\nmore detailed analysis of this interplay.\nThe Cooper pair scattering VT (~k, \u2212~k, ~k \u2032 ) transforms\naccording to one of the 5 irreducible representations\nof the point group of the 2D square lattice. Among\nthose there is the one-dimensional representation with\ndx2 \u2212y2 -symmetry important for smaller |t\u2032 | and the twodimensional representation transforming like px and py .\nIn a solution of the BCS gap equation, components belonging to different representations do not mix, while e.g.\nwithin the p-representation components px \u221d cos \u03b8 and\npy \u221d sin \u03b8 and corresponding higher harmonics \u221d cos 3\u03b8\nand \u221d sin 3\u03b8 (also called f -wave) will occur together.\nAs shown in the right plot of Fig. 3 for t\u2032 = \u22120.45t,\nthe critical temperature drops by several orders of magnitude when we increase the particle density per site from\nthe VH value hni \u2248 0.47 at \u03bc = \u22121.8t to hni \u2248 0.58\nat \u03bc = \u22121.7t. Further upon moving away from the VH\nfilling, the growth of the FM susceptibility gets cut off\nand the p-wave triplet SC susceptibilities with symmetry px \u221d cos \u03b8 or py \u221d sin \u03b8 diverge at low temperature.\nHigher order harmonics \u221d cos 3\u03b8 and sin 3\u03b8 diverge in a\nweaker fashion. The pair scattering at low T in this parameter range is shown in Fig.4. One nicely observes that\nthe pair scattering involving particles close to the saddle\npoints is suppressed as the odd-parity nature of the pwave pairing requires an opposite sign of the pair scattering VT (~k, \u2212~k, ~k \u2032 ) e.g. for ~k \u2032 \u2248 (0, \u03c0) and ~k \u2032 \u2248 (0, \u2212\u03c0).\nComparing the temperature derivatives of FM and SC\nsusceptibilities when the leading couplings become larger\nthan 12t, the transition from the FM to the p-wave SC\nregime occurs at a particle density hni \u2248 0.52 per site or\n\u03bc = \u22121.76t. Again, just as in the interplay between AF\nand dx2 \u2212y2 SC fluctuations for small |t\u2032 |, our one-loop\nflow to strong coupling exhibits a smooth evolution from\nthe FM dominated to the p-wave dominated instability.\nThis suggests a transition between the two types of ordered states as a function of the band filling provided\nthat symmetry-breaking at T > 0 becomes possible in\na three-dimensional environment. From our analysis the\ntransition appears to be first order, but additional interaction effects beyond our one-loop calculation could\nchange that.\nWith our method we cannot calculate the SC gap function directly, but we can use the pair scattering obtained\nfrom the RG flow as a pair potential in the BCS gap equation. In our case, it is plausible to assume [21] that the\nSC gap function will be a nodeless superposition of the\ntwo components with symmetries px and py , e.g. given by\n\u2206(~k) = \u22060 (~k) (kx + iky ), which maximizes the condensation energy. The real\u2013valued prefactor \u22060 (~k) takes care\nof the anisotropy within symmetry-related FS parts. The\ndirection of the Cooper pair spin remains indeterminate\nin the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The strongly angledependent gap function calculated with the rescaled pair\n\n\fdominated by triplet SC correlations suggesting a highly\nanisotropic energy gap.\nWe are grateful to T.M. Rice, M.

The flow to strong coupling\nclose to half-filling for small next nearest neighbor hopping t\u2032 with its AF and dx2 \u2212y2 -pairing regimes is qualitatively similar to the RG flow known from the momentumshell techniques [5\u20137]. For larger absolute values of t\u2032 beyond a quantum critical point at t\u2032c \u2248 \u22120.33t the flow to\nstrong coupling is dominated by FM fluctuations. This\nhas not been found with the momentum-shell schemes\nused previously [5\u20137] for the reasons explained in Ref.\n[9]. Finally, for larger |t\u2032 |, when the electron density is\nincreased slightly above the VH density, the FM tendencies get cut off at low T and the flow to strong coupling is\n4\n\n[1] D. J.
