Several scoring schemes have been proposed based on amino acid similarity. The mutation\ndata matrices of Dayhoff [6] and the substitution matrices of Henikoff [1] are standard choices of scores for\nsequence alignment and amino acid similarity evaluation. However, these matrices, focusing on the whole\nprotein database, pay little attention on protein secondary structures(ss). How the amino acid similarity\nis influenced by different secondary structures is an interesting question. Furthermore, understanding the\ndifferences can help us in protein sequence analysis.\n1\n\n\fDespite efforts in uncovering the information encoded in the primary structure, we still cannot read\nthe language describing the final 3D fold of an active biological macromolecule. Compared with the DNA\nsequence, a protein sequence is generally much shorter, but the size of the alphabet is five times larger. A\nproper coarse-graining of the 20 amino acids into fewer clusters for different conformation is important for\nimproving the signal-to-noise ratio when extracting information by statistical means.\nIt is our purpose to propose a simple scheme to study amino acid similarity from amino acid string\nstatistics. Information about the environment for an amino acid at a certain conformation state may be\nprovided by statistics of residue strings or windows centered at the amino acid. The success of window-based\napproaches such as GOR [2] for secondary structure prediction validates the use of such statistics. We shall\nderive a measure for the difference of amino acid pairs based on the distance of probability distributions,\nand investigate how the difference is dependent on conformations.\n\n2\n\nAmino acid distances\n\nOur discussion will be heavily based on the distance between two probability distributions. A well defined\nmeasure of the distance is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance or relative entropy [7, 8, 9], which, for two\ndistributions {pi } and {qi }, is given by\nX\n\nd({pi }, {qi }) =\n\npi log(pi /qi ).\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nIt corresponds a likelihood ratio, and, if pi is expanded around qi , its leading term is the \u03c72 distance:\nd\u03c7 ({pi }, {qi }) =\n\nX\n\n(pi \u2212 qi )2 /pi .\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nIt is often to use the following symmetrized form for the KL distance\nD({pi }, {qi }) = 12 [d({pi }, {qi }) + d({qi }, {pi })].\n\n(3)\n\nThe distributions to be considered here come from window statistics. For a given amino acid residue\nai = x at the conformation state \u03b1 in a sequence a1 a2 * * * ai * * *, we take the string a\u2212n+i a\u2212n+i+1 * * * ai * * * ai+n\nof width (2n + 1) as a window. Denote by Nk (y|x, \u03b1) the count of residue y at the k-th site from the center\nof such windows. As in GOR, only the conformation of the central residue is concerned. A quantity derived\nfrom Nk (y|x, \u03b1) is\nN (x, \u03b1) =\n\nX\ny\n\n2\n\nNk (y|x, \u03b1),\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhich, as the total count of residue x at the conformation \u03b1, is independent of k. The conditional probability\ndistribution Pk (y|x, \u03b1) is estimated as\nPk (y|x, \u03b1) =\n\nNk (y|x, \u03b1)\n.\nN (x, \u03b1)\n\n(5)\n\nThe weight matrix M20\u00d72n with its entries being Pk (y|x, \u03b1) is the so-called residue profile of x at \u03b1. Such\nprofiles are used in window-based approaches, e.g. GOR and artificial neural network algorithm [12].\nWe expect that on average the correlation between the central residue and an outer site decays when\nthey become far apart in sequence. To examine the correlation, we consider a large window width of 21, i.e.\nn = 10, and take the 'noise' background to be the following average:\n\" \u22128\n#\n10\nX\nX\n1\nPk (y|x, \u03b1) +\nPk (y|x, \u03b1) .\nQ(y|x, \u03b1) = 6\nk=\u221210\n\n(6)\n\nk=8\n\nThe KL distance Dk;x,\u03b1 ({Pk (y|x, \u03b1)}, {Q(y|x, \u03b1)}) provides a measure of the correlation between the central\nsite and site k. As we shall see, for our purpose of amino acid comparison a narrow window of a strong\ncorrelation with width of 7 is used to describe amino acid enviroment.\nUsing distribution Pk (y|x, \u03b1) from window statistics to characterize amino acid residues, we define the\ndistance of residue pair x and y at the same conformation \u03b1 as the following sum of KL distances\nDxy;\u03b1 =\n\nX\n\nD({Pk (z|x, \u03b1)}, {Pk (z|y, \u03b1)}).\n\n(7)\n\nk=\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13\n\nSimilarly, to explore the difference of the same residue x at different conformations \u03b1 and \u03b2, we may define\nthe distance\nD\u03b1\u03b2;x =\n\nX\n\nD({Pk (z|x, \u03b1)}, {Pk (z|x, \u03b2)}).\n\n(8)\n\nk=\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13\n\nBy means of the residue pair distances we can further study the classification of amino acids. With the\nKL distance, we may define the cluster distance in a way consistent with that for residue pairs. For example,\nwe characterize the cluster consisting of residues x and y by the 'coarse-grained' probability\nPk (z|x&y, \u03b1) =\n\nNk (z|x, \u03b1) + Nk (z|y, \u03b1)\n.\nN (x, \u03b1) + N (y, \u03b1)\n\n(9)\n\nWe then may define the distance between this cluster and some other residues or clusters. With cluster\ndistance defined, the cluster analysis can be used to reduce amino acid alphabets.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nResults\n\nOur analysis is performed on a data set taken from the database PDB SELECT[3, 4] of nonredundant protein\nsequences with known structures. The sequences share amino acid identity less than 25%. We keep only\nthe non-membrane sequences with their lengths between 80 and 420. The secondary structure assignment\nis taken from the DSSP database [5]. As in GOR, we use the following reduction of the 8 DSSP states to 4\nstates of helix(h), sheet(e), coil(c) and turn(t): H, G, I \u2192 h, E \u2192 e, X, S, B \u2192 c and T \u2192 t. The counts of\neach amino acid at the reduced four different conformation states are given in Table 1.\nWe first estimate probability distributions of residues for each central residue at a given conformation.\nAt this step, the window width is 21. We then calculate distances Dk;x,\u03b1 ({Pk (y|x, \u03b1)}, {Q(y|x, \u03b1)}) of these\ndistributions to their corresponding noise distributions. The results are shown in Figs. 1 to 4, each of which\nis for one conformation of the central residue. The 20 curves in each figure correspond to 20 central amino\nacids. Due to the sample size difference, curves are not directly comparable. (Roughly speaking, under the\nnull hypothesis of identical distribution the \u03c72 distance should be scaled with the sample size, so a small\nsample size would give a relatively large distance.) However, a decay is clearly seen when the site k become\nfar away from the center. For more discussions on correlations we refer reader to [10, 11]. As seen from\nmost curves of the figures, distances at the 6 sites nearest to the center are significantly larger than those at\nwindow border sites. We shall use window width of 7 for further comparison of amino acids.\nIt is natural to expect that similar residues would have similar window statistics. Thus, the KL distance\nbetween two residue profiles provides a measure of their similarity, i.e. a small KL distance implies a large\nsimilarity. We calculate the KL distance matrices Dxy;\u03b1 for residue pairs at different conformations with\nformula (7). The results are given in Tables 2 and 3, where entries have been multiplied by a factor 200. With\nthe distributions (9) defined for clusters, we further perform the simplest bottom-up approach of hierachical\nclustering for residues, by starting from 20 clusters of single residues, and then joining two nearest clusters\nstep by step until a single cluster is obtained. The results of clustering are given in Tables 4 to 7. Since\nthe dendritic trees returned from clustering are less informative, for visualization we introduce graphs where\nvertices are the 20 amino acids, and an edge exists between a pair of amino acids if and only if their distance\nis below some preset threshold. Graphs obtained from the distance matrices are shown in Figs. 5 to 8, where\nvertices with no connecting edges are neglected.\nIn sequence pair alignment we often do not have structure information of both sequences. With the\n4\n\n\fstructure information ignored, we have the mixed counts\nNk (y|x) =\n\nX\n\nNk (y|x, \u03b1),\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1\n\nfrom which we calculate the residue pair distances averaged over conformations. The distance matrix obtained is given in Table 8. We have also calculated distances (8) to compare different conformations. Distances between any two conformations for various residues are listed in Table 9.\n\n4\n\nDiscussions\n\nFigures 1 to 4 illustrate the dependence of outer sites in a window on the center. Although in the KL\ndistance we sum up effects on individual residues from the center, we still can see the tendency that the\ncenter is generally more strongly correlated with the C-terminal sites than N-terminal sites. Furthermore,\nwe may divide the 20 amino acids into two groups with M, I, L, V, F, Y and W in one, and the remainders in\nthe other. They roughly correspond to hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. It is seen that for the coil and\nturn conformations a hydrophobic center exhibits a stronger correlation with outer sites than a hydrophilic\ncenter, while for the sheet conformation a hydrophilic center exhibits a stronger correlation.\nIt is interesting to make a comparison between the distance matrices obtained here with the commonly\nused BLOSUM62 similarity score matrix. A small distance implies a large similarity score. There are many\nevidences showing the consistency between the distances and scores. For example, residue pairs VI, IL, VL\nand ST have positive BLOSUM scores and at the same time small distances. The graphs in Figs. 5 to 8\ncontain two connected subgraphs: one consists of I, L, V, F, Y, and the other consists of S, T. This is\nanother evidence of the consistency. Generally, the averaged distance matrix is closer to BLOSUM62 than\nthe conformation specific ones. However, there do exist some remarkable differences. For example, residue\npairs GT, QA, FV with negative scores have rather small distances in either the conformation helix, or sheet\nor coil, while pairs YH and NH with positive scores have rather large distances in the helix conformation.\nMoreover, YH has a large distance in all the four conformations.\nBLOSUM matrices are derived from conserved amino acid patterns called blocks. It is expected that for\nmost score entries we should see the consistency in at least one conformation specific distance matrix. For a\ngiven residue pair, if residue profiles of an amino acid center are very dissimilar for different conformations,\nafter averaging over conformations the pair distance would generally become smaller. In this case, BLOSUM\n5\n\n\fscores and conformation specific distance need not be consistent since the former contains no structure\ninformation.\nOur results show some strong dependence of residue behavior on conformations. For example, the\ndistances of pairs CD and SI in helix are about twice higher than in sheet. There are many residue pairs\ndisplaying strong dependence of distances on conformations. Table 9 views the conformation dependence\nfrom conformation pair comparison. Indeed, the table indicates that for any conformation pairs there are\ncertain residues which behave very differently in the two conformations. However, generally speaking, coil\nand turn are quite similar.\nIn comparison of physicochemical properties of amino acids, the abundance of amino acids is not taken\ninto consideration. This is also the case for the above defined distances. Other statistical variables including\nthe effect of sample size may be introduced. One candidate is the \u03c72 statistic for identical distributions.\nThe analysis using this new statistic is under study.\nWe expect that algorithms using multiple conformation specific matrices should work better in sequence\nalignment. The popular Needleman-Wunsch algorithm can be modified to include putative conformation for\neach residue. This will be discussed elsewhere.\nThis work was supported in part by the Special Funds for Major National Basic Research\nProjects and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
