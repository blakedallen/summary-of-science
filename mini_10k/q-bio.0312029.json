From Hong Kong, the virus spread\nthroughout the world: largely due to the airline (small\nworld) network hub in Hong Kong. The economic and\nsocial effects of the SARS virus have been subject of\nmuch attention in the popular media [2] and have been\nwidely reported. Less well reported, but no less unusual is the effect this disease had on academic activities, including the cancellation of the 2003 International\nSymposium on Nonlinear Theory and its Applications.\nIn this report we analyse the SARS daily infection data for Hong Kong and test the validity of three\ndistinct types of models: (i) stochastic models generated from surrogate data; (ii) standard susceptibleinfected-removed (SIR) models; and (iii) small world\nnetwork models. We find that the small world network\nmodels are the only models capable of reproducing the\nquantitative behaviour of the SARS epidemic in Hong\nKong. Moreover, these models also exhibit many features characteristic of this epidemic: a small fraction of\nindividuals show a very great propensity to infect others\n(the \"super-spreaders\"); and, propagation of the virus\nManuscript received January 1, 2003.\nManuscript revised January 1, 2003.\nFinal manuscript received January 1, 2003.\n\u2020\nThe authors are with the Department of Electronic and\nInformation Engineering of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University\n\u2217\nThat is, Special Administrative Region of China, not to\nbe confused with the virus.\n\nFig. 1 Daily reported SARS infections. The top plot\nshows the daily number of SARS infections in Hong Kong. The\nlower plot are the daily number of infections in Taiwan (dotdashed), Singapore (dashed), and the Chinese mainland (solid).\nFor the purpose of comparison, the numbers on the lower plot are\nnormalised by the maximum daily infection tally. The maximum\ndaily infection tally for Taiwan, Singapore and China was 26, 13\nand 203. The data for Taiwan and Singapore has been revised\nbased on case information after the epidemic, this has not been\npossible for the China data.\n\nwithin certain physical locations led to a large number\nof infections (the outbreaks in Prince of Wales Hospital\nand Amoy Gardens Housing Estate).\nFigure 1 shows the daily infection rate for SARS\nin Hong Kong between 15 February 2003 and 15 June\n2003. Compared to the data for other territories (lower\npanel of Fig. 1), the data for Hong Kong appears to\nbe more complete (compared to Taiwan), more accurate (compared to the Chinese mainland\u2217\u2217 ) and over\na longer time period (compared to Singapore). The\ndata for Hong Kong is shown as two time series, the\noriginal daily number of infections, as recorded by the\nHong Kong Department of Health, and revised figures\nreleased after a more detailed analysis of the true infection path [3]. The revised data offers a more accurate\npicture of the true daily number of infections, but this\ndata uses information not available at the time of the\noutbreak and we therefore do not analyse that data in\n\u2217\u2217\n\nIn fact, various sources for the Chinese mainland data\nshowed widely divergent estimates. Furthermore, subsequent analysis has shown that the original data significantly\nover-estimated the effect of the virus.\n\n\fIEICE TRANS. ??, VOL.Exx\u2013??, NO.xx XXXX 200x\n\n2\n(1)\n\n(a) x \u2212x\nt\n\nt+1\n\n60\n40\n\nz(1)\nt\n\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n(b) log(xt/xt+1)\n3\n\nz(1)\nt\n\n2\n1\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nday\n\nFig. 2 Inter-day variability.

For notational convenience\nwe denote the entire time series as {xt }t = {xt }N\nt=0 =\n(x0 , x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ).\nThe remainder of this paper describes the analysis of the original data in Fig. 1(a) with three different model structures. In the next section we describe\nthe application of surrogate data techniques to test the\nHong Kong SARS time series against the hypothesis\nthat inter-day variability in the reported incidence of\nSARS is random. In Section 3 we assess the accuracy\nof the SIR model and in Section 4 we describe the small\nworld network model.\n2.\n\nRandom variability\n\nThe simplest model of disease propagation is that of a\nrandom walk such that x0 = xN = 0 and xt \u2265 0 for\nt = 0, . . . , N . The duration of the disease, N , is essentially a random variable. The inter-day variation is\nrandom and, according to the Central Limit Theorem,\nthe disease will eventually die out.\nOur first task is to transform the data in Fig. 1 to\nhave zero mean and be approximately independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.). We do this by taking the\ndifference of successive values\n(1)\n\nzt\n\n= xt \u2212 xt+1\n\nor taking the log-ratio of successive values\nxt\n(2)\nzt = log\n.\nxt+1\n\n(1)\n\nBoth {zt }t and {zt }t are depicted in Fig. 2. We note\nthat because there is an underlying pattern in {|xt |}t\n(2)\nwe expect that {zt }t will offer a time series closer to\n(1)\ni.i.d than {zt }t .\nWe now apply the method of surrogate data [4],\n[5] to determine whether the transformed data in Fig.\n2 is statistically distinct from i.i.d. noise. Note that\nthis is equivalent to testing whether the raw time series\n{|xt |}t is a random walk.\nTo test for i.i.d. noise the method of surrogate data\nspecifies that one should generate an ensemble of surrogate data sets. Each surrogate data set is a realisation\nof an i.i.d. process, but is otherwise \"like\" the original\ndata. From this ensemble of surrogates one estimates\nsome statistical quantity and compares this distribution of statistic values to the statistic value for the true\ndata. If the true data has a statistical value typical of\nthe surrogates then the underlying hypothesis (in this\ncase, that the data is i.i.d.) may not be rejected. If the\ndata is atypical of the surrogate distribution then the\nhypothesis may be rejected.\nTo generate suitable surrogates, we wish to destroy\ntemporal correlation but preserve the data's probability density function. The simplest way to do this is\nby randomly shuffling either without [4] or with [6] replacement. The choice of suitable test statistic is also\nimportant [7]. In our past experience we have advocated correlation dimension [7] or other dynamic invariants [5]. However, for such extremely short time series\nthis is inappropriate. We attempted to use nonlinear\ncomplexity [8] as a measure, but found that this index\nexhibited extremely low sensitivity. We instead settle\non the normalised covariance between xt and xt+1\n< xt xt+1 >\n.\n< x2t >\nOne further advantage of this simple measure is that\nit is sensitive to linear dependence: exactly the property we wish to detect. Unfortunately, this also means\nthat testing more complex linear surrogate hypotheses\nwill not be possible. Hence, as suggested by Takens [9]\nwe prefer to test the model residuals against the i.i.d.\nhypothesis.\nThe results of Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the data\nof Fig. 2 is not consistent with an i.i.d. noise source.\nTherefore the original data (Fig. 1) may not be modelled as a simple random walk.\nIt would be logical to continue this analysis with\nmore sophisticated surrogate algorithms [4], [10]. However, for this short time series results of more sophisticated algorithms are not conclusive. Furthermore, as\nwe have already noted, it would not be possible to apply the covariance as a discriminating statistic in these\ncases, as the surrogate algorithms explicitly preserve\nautocorrelation. Instead, in the following section we\nconsider a simple deterministic model of disease propagation.\n\n\fSMALL et al.: PLAUSIBLE MODELS FOR PROPAGATION OF THE SARS VIRUS\n\n3\n(a) Standard SIR fit\n\n(a) xt\u2212xt+1\n\n80\n\n100\n\n60\n\n90\n\nxt\n\n80\n\n40\n\n70\n20\n\ncount\n\n60\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nday t\n(b) Noisy SIR realisations\n\n40\n120\n\n30\n\n100\n\n20\n\n80\n\n0\n\u22120.4\n\nx\n\nt\n\n10\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n<xtxt+1>\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n(b) log(x /x\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nday t\n\n)\n\nt t+1\n\n80\n\nFig. 4 SIR models of SARS.

In both cases the hypothesis that\nthe data in Fig. 2 is independent and identically distributed noise\nis soundly rejected (p > 0.95).\n\n3.\n\nSIR models\n\nThe standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)\nmodel of disease propagation has a long history and\nis considered in detail in any standard text on mathematical biology [11]. In difference equation form, the\nrelationship between the three populations at time t\nmay be expressed as\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\nSt+1\nSt (1 \u2212 rIt )\n\uf8ed It+1 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed (rSt + (1 \u2212 a))It \uf8f8\n(1)\nRt + aIt\nRt+1\nwhere St , It , Rt are the number (or proportion) of\nindividual that are susceptible to infection, infected\nand \"removed\" respectively. Not that, by removed, we\nmean individuals that have been infected but are no\nlonger infectious or susceptible. Such individuals may\nbe cured (and immune), quarantined, or dead. The parameters r and a are the infection rate and the removal\nrate respectively.\nUsing the SIR data we obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (i.e. minimum least squares fit) of the\nparameters a and r for the Hong Kong SARS time series. The time series in Fig. 1 is the number of new\ninfections reported each day. This corresponds to the\n\nterm rSt It in Eqn. (1). The numerical fitting procedure often estimates (incorrectly) a monotonically increasing of decreasing function. To prevent these solutions, we add leading and trailing zeros to the data\nprior to fitting. This helps to ensure that the optimal\nmodel exhibits a single extremum - not at either endpoint. An alternative to fitting rSt It to the observed\ndata would be to also consider the daily fatality and\nrecovery data for Hong Kong as an approximation for\n\u2206Rt . One could then fit \u2206It and \u2206Rt directly from\nthe observed data.\nIn Fig. 4 (a) we see the time course of the best\nmodel (Eqn. (1)) fitted from this data. Clearly, this\ndeterministic model does not capture the random variation observed in the data.\nOne way of considering this random variation is\nthat the SIR model provides an estimate of the rate of\ninfection (i.e. It+1 = (rSt + (1 \u2212 a))It ), but that this\nestimate is subject to random fluctuations. It may be\nbetter therefore to perturb the number of new infections\nby some unknown quantity \u01ebt . The modified, stochastic\nSIR equations then read\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nSt+1\nSt (1 \u2212 rIt ) \u2212 \u01ebt\n\uf8ed It+1 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed (rSt + (1 \u2212 a))It + \u01ebt \uf8f8 .\n(2)\nRt+1\nRt + aIt\nA similar random term could be added to the rate of\nremoval, however we do not consider this problem here.\nMoreover, arbitrarily complex noise inputs could be devised that would eventually reproduce features of the\nobserved data. Our concern is only whether these features can be observed from the SIR model, or immediate generalisations of this model.\nWe found that simulations with \u01ebt \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 ) for a\nconstant \u03c3 2 did not produce realistic simulations. The\nproblem is that the magnitude of the random fluctuation should be proportional to the number of infected\n\n\fIEICE TRANS. ??, VOL.Exx\u2013??, NO.xx XXXX 200x\n\n4\n(a) parameter fits for a and r\n\n(a) xt\n\n52.5\n\n\u221211.82\n\n120\n52\n\n\u221211.84\n\n51.5\n\n\u221211.86\n\n80\n\n51\n\n\u221211.88\n\n60\n\n50.5\n0\n\ncount\n\n100\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n\u221211.9\n\n90\n\nwindowed optimal parameters: a (blue) and log(r) (green)\n(b) simulation\n100\n\n40\n\n80\n60\n\nxt\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n<xtxt+1>\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n20\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nday t\n\n(b) log(x /x\n\n)\n\nt t+1\n\n80\n\nFig. 6 Variable parameters (a,r).

Few infected individuals are unlikely to\nhave a great variation in effect, but many such individuals will. In Fig. 4 (b) we show five simulations with\nthe noise term \u01ebt \u223c N (0, (It \u03c3)2 ). To ensure that the\nmodel is physically realistic (i.e. non-negative populations) we also restrict \u01ebt > \u2212(rSt + (1 \u2212 a))It . We\nfound that \u03c3 \u2248 0.25 gave quantitatively reasonable results and this is the value employed in Fig. 4.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the\nSIR type models (Eqn. (2)) we apply a variant on\nthe method of surrogate data [7]. However, instead of\ngenerating constrained realisations consistent with the\nnull hypothesis\u2020 , we generate multiple realisations of\nthe model and compare these realisations to the data\n[9]. For the model described by Eqn. (2) we generate 1000 simulations and for each simulation compute\nt\n. That\n< xt xt+1 > and < zt zt+1 > where zt = log xxt+1\nis, we use two distinct test statistics. Results for both\n\u2020\nSee [12] for a description of this rather exclusive nomenclature. Informally this means we do not force the surrogates to preserve specific properties of the data. This means\nthat we are unable to reject all SIR models with this test,\nonly the SIR models that are fit to this data.\n\nstatistics are plotted in Fig. 5 show a clear distinction between data and surrogates. Since this model is\nthe optimal fit to the data and the distribution of covariance estimates do not vary greatly with change in\nmodel parameters\u2020\u2020 , we therefore conclude that models\nof the form Eqn. (2) are not adequate to describe the\nunderlying dynamics.\nOne widely accepted reason for the failure of the\nSIR models is that the parameters a and r do not remain constant during the time course of an epidemic.\nParticularly when a disease is previously unknown and\npublic health practice changes significantly in response\nto the spread of the disease. This is certainly consistent\nwith the situation for SARS in Hong Kong. We therefore modify the SIR model of Eqn. (1) by estimating\nthe temporal dependence of a and r. We apply a sliding\nwindow of width 10 days and re-estimate a and r for\nevery day. Figure 6 depicts the results of this computation. The values at and rt are based on the best fit estimate of Eqn. (1) to the data (xt , xt+1 , xt+2 , . . . , xt+10 ).\nWhile the simulations in Fig. 6 (b) does have the\ncorrect shape, if not the correct magnitude, the values of a and r depicted in Fig. 6 (a) illustrate the\nproblem with this approach. The parameter values\nare sensitively dependent on the observed data and do\nnot reflect reality. In a separate publication we modify this approach by considering longer windows and\nhave shown the utility of the ratio r/a for estimating the effectiveness of various governmental control\nstrategies [13]. A combination of the random fluctuations approach of Eqn. (2) and the variability in a\nand r may produce more realistic simulations. However, we feel that this would represent a significant overparameterisation of this modelling problem.\nFor the current investigation we conclude that a\ngeneral SIR model is unable to capture the underly\u2020\u2020\n\nThat is, the statistic is approximately pivotal [7].\n\n\fSMALL et al.: PLAUSIBLE MODELS FOR PROPAGATION OF THE SARS VIRUS\n\n5\n\n4.\n\n(a) simulations\n80\n\nxt\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n10\n\np1 and p2\n\ning dynamics of the system. More exotic SIR inspired\nmodels, or more contrived noise inputs, may be able\nto reproduce the observed behaviour. Indeed, we expect this should be the case when the system becomes\ncomplex enough. But this is beyond the focus of the\ncurrent communication and is in general a less interesting problem. In the following section we consider a\ncomputationally more extensive model that is inspired\nby the physical situation and provides a more realistic\nalternative.\nSmall world networks\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n100\n\n120\n\nday t\n(b) variable infection probabilities\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22124\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nday t\n\nFig. 7 Variable parameters (p1 ,p2 ).

In contrast\nto potentially exotic modified SIR models, the model\nwe introduce here is inspired by our understanding of\nthe physical situation. Small world networks (SWN)\n[14] have recently become immensely popular and received significant attention in a wide variety of fields\n[15]. One system which has provided evidence of small\nworld structure is the network of social interaction between individuals (the so-called \"six degrees of separation\"). It is therefore natural to consider propagation\nof disease epidemics between nodes of a SWN.\nIn the following SWN we suppose that each node\nis either susceptible to disease (S), infected (I) or removed (R). However, unlike the standard SIR structure, nodes of the SWN can only infect those that they\nare acquainted with. We arrange the nodes in a rectangular grid (for Hong Kong, we use a square with side\nlength 2700). On a given day, each node can infect n1 of\nits four immediate neighbours (horizontally and vertically) with constant probability p1 . Each node also has\na random number of long range acquaintances. The\nnumber of long range acquaintances follows an exponential distribution with an expected value of n2 and\nthe acquaintances are chosen at random but fixed for\neach node. On each day, each of the long range acquaintances may be infected with some constant probability\np2 . Finally, on each day, every infected node has probability r1 of becoming removed. As with the SIR model,\nthe only possible transitions are S \u2192 I \u2192 R.\nFor our first simulations we simplify this structure\nby setting r1 = 0. To avoid eventual complete contamination we vary (i.e. decrease) p1 and p2 with time\naccording to the scheme in Fig. 7 (b). The values depicted in Fig. 7 are selected only because they yield\na model with has a realistic behaviour. Figure 7 (a)\ncompares five random realisations of \u2206St to the observed data. We see that the quantitative features are\nreproduced nicely.\nIn Fig. 8 (a) we repeat the surrogate calculations of\nthe previous sections for 1000 realisations of the process\ndepicted in Fig. 7. An examination of the variation in\nthe estimated covariance shows that the data and model\nsimulations are in very close agreement.

This good agreement is\ndue to a combination of long range correlation present\nin the model data and the same \"burstiness\" that is\n\n\fIEICE TRANS. ??, VOL.Exx\u2013??, NO.xx XXXX 200x\n\n6\n\nalso observed in the true data. In Fig. 7 we see that\nboth model and simulations exhibit similar large spikes\nwhen one (or several) so-called \"super-spreaders\" are\nencountered at random.\nHowever, this model is not entirely satisfactory.\nThe disease epidemic is controlled artificial by suitable\nselection of p1,2 (t). Furthermore, no nodes ever become\n\"removed\". To remedy this we set p1 (t) = p1 = 0.05,\np2 (t) = p2 = 0.005, and r1 = 0.1. These values are selected after a process of trial and error, but do roughly\ncorrespond to the experience of SARS in Hong Kong.\nThe probability p1 is the daily probability of infected\nclose family members or neighbours, p2 is the daily\nprobability of infecting more casual acquaintances. Finally, we allow for an exponential distribution of the\nnumber of neighbours with an expected value of 6.\nHence the system truly is a scale free network and the\nexistence of \"super-spreaders\" is explicitly modelled by\nthis random variable.\nThe time series produced by this simulation are\nsimilar to those of the restricted SWN in Fig. 7. The\nmajor differences are the inclusion of the removed category and that the infection probabilities do not change\nwith time. A constant value for p1,2 may not be entirely realistic, but is is a statistical necessity to avoid\nover-fitting in such a complex stochastic model. A consequence of these constant values of p1,2 is that often\nthe disease will \"die-out\" immediately, or, it will run\nout of control and infect the entire community. In simulations, both situations are common, but so to is the\neventual control of the epidemic: without changing the\ninfection control policy!\nWe do not show typical trajectories of this final\nmodel because they are similar to those shown in Fig.\n7, only with a slightly larger variability. In Fig. 8 we\ngenerate 1000 simulations of length greater than 90 (i.e.\nsimulations that immediately die out are rejected) but\nno longer than 120 (longer simulations were truncated)\nof this SWN system (n1 = 4, E(n2 ) = 10, p1 = 0.25,\np2 = 0.001, and r1 = 0.45) \u2020 and compare the covariance of \u2206St to the true data. In each case we are unable\nto reject the underlying SWN model. A slight increase\nin variability (when compared to the previous model\nwith artificially variable p1,2 ) is observed in this second\nstructure and we believe that this is due to the lower\nlevel of \"control\" on the parameter values and the inclusion of both simulations that die out, and those that\nrun out of control in the analysis.\n\n\u2020\nSimulations were repeated with a variety of other values\nand a wide variety of dynamics behaviour. Most notably the\nparameter values n1 = 4, E(n2 ) = 6, p1 = 0.05, p2 = 0.005,\nand r1 = 0.1 produced surrogate results similar to those in\nFig. 8. These two sets of parameter values where selected\nas they reflected the authors' understandings of the physical\nenvironment.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe daily reported SARS figures for Hong Kong have\nbeen considered. We find that the data is not consistent with a random walk or a noisy version of the\nstandard SIR model. However, two SWN structures do\nexhibit dynamics indistinguishable from the true data.\nTo accurately simulate the spread of disease in society,\nincluding features observed during the SARS epidemic\n(such as rapid, extensive and localised outbreaks), one\nneeds to consider complex SWN type structures. The\npower of the SIR model lies in its ability to model large\nscale spread of a contagion, the SWN structure described here is much better at simulating the localised\nvariability. This localised variability, inherent to the\nmodel simulations may allow administrators and forecasters to estimate possible variation in their predictions of disease dynamics (i.e. to provide error bars\non their projections and evaluate the likelihood of various scenarios). Such techniques are certain to be useful\nwhen planning and implementing control strategies. In\na related publication, we provide a more detailed analysis of the potential scale-free structure of various SWN\nmodels [13]. Furthermore, in this paper we propose the\nvariable parameter SWN model is actually inspired by\ngovernmental public health practice [13]. In this current we our primary goal is to show that SWN models are able to capture the underlying dynamics of the\nSARS epidemic better than either simple stochastic or\nSIR models.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research is supported by Hong Kong University\nGrants Council CERG number PolyU 5235/03E.\nReferences\n[1] World Health Organisation, \"Consensus document on the\nepidemiology of sars,\" tech. rep., World Health Organisation, 17 October 2003. http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/\nWHOconsensus.pdf.\n[2] Various Authors South China Morning Post, Virtually every day since February 15 2003.\n[3] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Expert Committee,\n\"Report of the severe acute respiratory syndrome expert committee,\" tech. rep., Hong Kong Department of Health, 2 October 2003.\nhttp://www.sarsexpertcom.gov.hk/english/reports/ report.html.\n[4] J.
