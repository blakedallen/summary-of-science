This quasi one-dimensional (1D) system\nundergoes at least two charge density wave (CDW) transitions at low temperature, which can\nbe attributed to electronic instabilities in the fractionally-filled 1D bands of the high-symmetry\nphase. Upon cooling, Si(553)-Au first undergoes a single-band Peierls distortion, resulting in period\ndoubling along the imaged chains.

These\nlocked-in periodicities indicate small charge transfer between the nearly half-filled and quarter-filled\n1D bands. The presence and the mobility of atomic scale dislocations in the \u00d73 CDW state indicates\nthe possibility of manipulating phase solitons carrying a (spin,charge) of (1/2, \u00b1e/3) or (0, \u00b12e/3).\nPACS numbers: 73.20.At, 73.20.Mf, 71.10.Pm, 68.37.Ef\n\nAccording to the Mermin-Wagner theorem [1], thermodynamic fluctuations preclude the formation of a longrange ordered broken symmetry state in 1D, except at T\n= 0 K [2]. For all practical purposes, however, thermodynamic phase transitions may still be possible in finite\nsize 1D systems. Furthermore, fluctuations are inevitably\nsuppressed if the 1D chains are weakly coupled, or if the\nchains are coupled to a substrate [2, 3]. Prototypical\n1D metallic systems like the transition metal trichalcogenides, organic charge transfer salts, blue bronzes, and\nprobably all atomic Au-chain reconstructions on vicinal\nSi substrates exhibit symmetry breaking phase transitions at finite temperatures [4, 5]. For a band filling of\n1/n, the phase transition opens up a gap in the single\nparticle excitation spectrum at wavevector kF = \u03c0/na,\nand the corresponding broken symmetry state adopts the\nnew periodicity of \u03bb = \u03c0/kF = na, where a is the lattice\nparameter of the high symmetry phase [4].\nFractional band fillings other than half filling provide an interesting subset of 1D systems which often\nexhibit exotic physical phenomena. Depending on the\nrelative magnitude of bandwidth and electron-electron\ninteraction, CDW states often compete with spin density waves, Mott insulating states, or a Luttinger liquid\nstate. Atomic-scale STM observations of surface phase\ntransitions provide important insights into the complexity of symmetry breaking phenomena in reduced dimensionality [6]. For instance, the recently reported 4 \u00d7 1to-8 \u00d7 2 phase transition in quasi-1D indium chains on\nSi(111) [6] involves a gap opening in a complex triple\nband Peierls system, resulting in a doubling of the periodicity along the atom chains. Another recently discovered system with three fractionally-filled bands is the\nSi(553)-Au surface. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [7] revealed three metallic bands but\n\ndespite theoretical efforts to understand the electronic\nstructure [7, 8] the atomic structure and real space location of the surface state orbitals remains unknown. Interestingly, the total band filling of this particular chain\nsystem is 4/3, i.e. corresponding to 8/3 electrons per\nsurface unit cell. Two bands have a filling of 0.56 and\n0.51 each, slightly more than half-filling. The third band\nhas a filling of 0.27, in between one quarter and one-third\nfilling.\nIn this Letter we present evidence for a defect mediated CDW transition [9] in Si(553)-Au accompanied by a\nmetal insulator transition. STM experiments reveal competing periodicities as a function of temperature which\ncan be mapped onto the band structure of the high symmetry phase. STS data show a gradual gap opening at\nlow temperatures, which can be correlated with successive gap openings in the three 1D bands. Interestingly,\nphase slips are observed in the CDW condensate. These\nphase slips should possess a fractional charge and a half\ninteger or integer spin. The chain-length can be tuned\nby manipulating the numerous defects with the STM tip.\nThis, in turn, suggests the feasibility of studying and manipulating fractional charges at the atomic scale.\nThe Si(553)-Au structure was prepared by depositing\n0.24 ML of Au at a rate of 0.005 ML/s with the substrate\nheld at 920 K, followed by thermal annealing at 1120 K\nfor 1 minute and slow cooling to room temperature or RT\n(1 Ks\u22121 ). STM and STS experiments were performed\nin an Omicron variable temperature STM. All distances\ndetermined in STM images were measured along the fast\nscan direction of the STM so as to minimize possible\neffects of thermal drift.\nFigure 1 shows an STM image of the surface taken at\nroom temperature (RT). Rather wide chains (\u223c 0.8 nm)\nwith a spacing of 1.48 nm are observed. The chains are\n\n\f2\ncut by point defects appearing as vacancies in both filled\nstate and empty state images. In the empty state image, these vacancies appear larger than in the filled state\nimage, confirming the observations reported in Ref. 10.\nNote, however, that fewer defects are present as compared to other work [7, 10], indicating that the defect\nconcentration can possibly be varied by controlling the\nannealing history of the surface despite propositions that\nthe defects might be intrinsic to the surface as stabilizing\ncharge dopants [7]. The insets show high resolution dual\nbias images. Clearly, the chains are composed of two\nrows of atoms, showing a zig-zag structure in the empty\nstate and a ladder configuration in the filled state. In the\nempty state image all atom spacings are nearly equal to\nthe bulk spacing of Si, a \u223c 3.8 \u00c5 resulting in bond angles near 60 degrees. In the filled state image the spacing\nalong the chain is equal to a whereas the spacing perpendicular to the chains is \u223c 4.7 \u00c5. These data seem to be\ninconsistent with structure models that place Si honeycomb chains [11] near the step edges [7, 8] and with the\nsingle atom row structure suggested in Ref. 10.\n\nthe I\u2212V -curve is flat at zero bias indicating semiconducting behavior. We determine the size of the gap from the\nderivative of the I \u2212 V -curves as displayed in the inset of\nFig. 3; we infer that the excitation gap is symmetric and\n\u223c 150 meV wide. Thus, the condensation of this CDW\nis accompanied by a metal-insulator transition (MIT).\nAlthough CDW instabilities in related surface systems\nare often manifested by an order-disorder transition [12],\nthe present observations are most straightforwardly interpreted in terms of a displacive CDW transition.\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) Empty state (1 V, 100 pA) STM\nimage at 40 K and magnification (b). In (b) a 6 \u00d7 1 unit cell is\nindicated with combined \u00d73 and \u00d72 features. (c) Filled state\n(-1 V, 100 pA) STM image corresponding to (b).\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Empty state and (b) filled state\n(\u00b10.5V, 50pA) STM images taken simultaneously at RT. Insets show magnifications. The structure in the chains is indicated with dots.\n\nUpon cooling to \u223c 40 K, the zig-zag features are no\nlonger observed. Instead, an up-down buckling with a\nladder structure in a tripled unit cell is observed (Fig. 2),\nresulting in two features of about 1.5a length and widths\ncomparable to those observed at RT. The corrugation of\nthe filled state image is in anti-phase with that of the\nempty state image; at the location of the intensity maxima in the empty state image, a small dip exists in the\nfilled state image. This indicates that the system has condensed into a CDW with tripled periodicity, commensurate with the substrate lattice. Additionally, the features\nin the valleys between the chains visible in the empty\nstate are completely ordered with a doubled period of 2a,\nresulting in a unit cell of 6 \u00d7 1.\nThe I \u2212 V -curves and their numerical derivatives are\nshown in Fig. 3. The I \u2212 V -curve at RT exhibits a significant slope at zero bias, confirming the metallicity observed in ARPES experiments [7]. In contrast, at 40 K\n\nFIG. 3: Area averaged STS curves measured at indicated\ntemperatures. Inset: numerical derivatives of the STS curves.\n\nThe condensation scenario involving all three 1D bands\nis elucidated by STM experiments at temperatures intermediate between RT and 40 K. Fig. 4 shows empty\nstate images measured at 70 K and at 110 K. At 70 K\na vague tripled corrugation is visible in nearly all of the\nchains, with significantly enhanced intensity near defects.\nIn the middle of longer chains segments the bulk period\nof 3.8 \u00c5 is still visible through the superimposed (vague)\ntripled periodicity. At 110 K, we observe a doubled periodicity in the bulk of most chains, but, again near defects\na tripled periodicity decaying into the chains is observed.\nFrom these data at higher temperatures, it is evident that\nthe CDW present at 40 K nucleates from the defects and\nspreads along the chains with decreasing temperature.\n\n\f3\nEven at RT, it is still possible to discern charge density oscillations emanating from the defects. These oscillations have been attributed to zero-dimensional end\nstate effects [10]. Alternatively, the change in apparent\nheight of the chain adjacent to a defect, i.e. a depression over a distance of \u223c 1.5a next to the defect followed by a brighter segment (see Fig. 1(a):inset), and\nthe non-metallic character of the chain ends established\nin Ref. [10], are fully consistent with the interpretation of\na CDW precursor, similar to that observed in Sn/Ge(111)\n[9].\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Empty state (1 V, 50 pA) STM images\nat 70 K and 110 K. \u00d73 and \u00d72 unit cells indicated in black\nand white, respectively.\n\nAs mentioned above, the band structure of this surface measured by ARPES contains three metallic bands\n[7]; two bands have a Fermi wave vector near half-filling,\nthe third band contains 0.27 \u00d7 2 = 0.54 electrons adding\nup to a total filling of 4/3. None of the bands crosses\nthe Fermi energy exactly at a wave vector 2\u03c0/(n \u00d7 a).\nNevertheless, we observe three commensurate periodicities evolving as a function of temperature: at 110 K a\nclear \u00d72 period is detected in the chains, at 40 K a \u00d72\nperiod is observed between the chains accompanied by\na \u00d73 period in the chains. Tentatively, we assign the\nthree observed periods to electronic instabilities in the\nthree metallic bands of the high symmetry phase, which\nwould locate the orbitals of the 0.51 and 0.27 filled bands\non top of the zig-zag chains and the orbitals of the 0.56\nfilled band in between the chains. At 110 K, the doubled periodicity along the chains originates from a CDW\ntransition in the 0.51 filled band; the other two bands remain metallic. STS measurements support this scenario,\nstill showing metallic behaviour at 110 K but with reduced slope at zero bias, indicating a reduced DOS at\nthe Fermi energy, see Fig. 3. ARPES at temperatures\n< 100 K show weak backfolding of the 0.27 filled band at\nthe \u00d72 zone boundary [7], also indicating a doubled periodicity in this band. The \u00d73 CDW at lower temperatures\ncan then be rationalized by a small charge transfer of 0.06\nelectron from the 0.56 filled band to the 0.27 filled band,\n\nfilling the latter to 1/3 [17]. The possible CDW precursor near the chain ends at RT can also be explained by\nthis charge transfer: at RT a \u00d72 period exists locally in\nbetween the chains near defects that are located on the\nchains [10]. This strongly suggests that already at RT\nthe 0.56 filled band, located in the valleys between the\nchains, is doping the chains near the defects to 1/3 filling. With this charge transfer the total band filling of\nthe surface then remains constant at 4/3. Note that this\nevolution in band structure might also explain the transformation of the features in the empty state STM image;\nfrom a zig-zag structure at RT to a ladder structure at\n110 K and below.\nSurprisingly, the competition between periodicities inside the chains is eventually won by a \u00d73 CDW at the\nlowest temperature studied. Longer wavelength periods\nare progressively more difficult to fit into chains with\nrandomly placed fixed defects. Furthermore, a 1/3 filled\nparabolic band has a higher DOS at the Fermi energy\nas compared to a 1/2 filled band, which according to a\nsimple BCS theory argument should result in a higher Tc\nfor the 1/3 filled band. The magnitude of the interchain\ncoupling for the different bands, though being fairly low\nas compared to other (bulk) 1D compounds [7], might\nprovide insight into this seeming contradiction. It is well\nknown that finite interchain coupling reduces the transition temperature and indeed ARPES measurements indicate a five times larger interchain coupling for the 1/3\nfilled band than for both of the 1/2 filled bands. This\ncould explain why the \u00d73 CDW sets in at a lower temperature than the period doubling CDW observed at 110\nK [18].\nFinite interchain coupling should be discernible in the\nSTM images through definite phase relations between periodicities in adjacent chains, provided that the temperature is low enough. Careful analysis of the empty state\nSTM images at 40 K indeed reveals small domains of up\nto three or four chains width, showing a constant phase\nrelation, but no long range order is detected. However,\nas can be observed in Fig. 2(a, arrow) even at 40 K there\nare chains which do not exhibit a fully developed CDW;\nthe triple periodicity is not long range ordered, despite\nthe fact that a fully developed triple period would fit the\nlength of this chain segment. This indicates that the system is affected by a significant amount of interchain coupling. This is further illustrated in Fig. 5(a). Two fairly\nlong chains (> 25 nm) are visible. Starting from the top\nboth chains lack a clear corrugation, but both chains develop a definite up-down corrugation towards the bottom.\nThe white bars illustrate a phase slip of 2\u03c0/3 in the right\nchain, immediately followed by two similar phase slips in\nthe left chain. These phase slips can not be explained by\na \u00d73 CDW mismatch in a finite chain segment because\nboth chains show a region of small corrugation at the top\n(and beyond, not shown) with an ill-defined phase so the\nCDW is not phase locked by defects. Therefore the ori-\n\n\f4\ngin must be related to interchain coupling; apparently, a\nphase slip in one chain can induce phase slips in neighboring chains via interchain coupling. Interestingly, a phase\nslip (phase soliton) in a 1/3 filled band CDW carries a\n(spin,charge) of (1/2, \u00b1e/3) or (0, \u00b12e/3) [14].\nFractionally charged phase slips have been studied\nmostly theoretically. Only in polyacetylene, a phase slip\nwith a fractional charge of e/2 has been observed by conductivity and NMR experiments [15]. To the best of\nour knowledge fractionally charged phase slips in CDWs\naway from half filling have never been observed directly\nby imaging. Their presence opens up the possibility to\nstudy and manipulate fractional charges at the atomic\nscale. They can possibly be manipulated by deliberately\ncreating defects in the chains so as to generate a misfit\nfor the \u00d73 CDW. In our STM experiments at 40 K defects sometimes jump to different locations during imaging. For example, Figs. 5(b) and (c) show two sequential\n(\u2206t = 180s) filled state images from the same area. The\nwhite circle and the arrow show a group of three defects\nwhich has moved two chains to the left. This behavior\nsuggests that these defects consist of Si adatoms [7, 8],\nwhich have been relocated by tip induced migration.\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) STM images at 40 K. (a) Empty state\n(1 V, 100 pA) image showing phase slips in the \u00d73 CDW. (b)\nand (c): filled state (-1 V, 50 pA) images showing relocation\nof defects. Black circles: markers. Arrow: old defect position.\nWhite circle: new defect position.\n\nIn conclusion, we have presented an STM and STS\nstudy of a chain structure with fractional band fillings.\nCompeting periodicities are observed as a function of\ntemperature resulting in a defect mediated CDW at 40 K.\nThe results can be mapped onto the band structure of the\nhigh symmetry phase. The presence and mobility of the\nchain dislocations in the CDW state indicates the possibility of studying and possibly manipulating fractionally\ncharged solitons with an STM tip. The availability of\nother vicinal Si-Au chain structures with tunable interchain coupling [7] would provide a promising playground\nfor 1D physics, accessible in real space.

[13], a commensurate CDW in a system with incommensurate Fermi wave-vectors can be obtained by locking the wavelength of the CDW to the lattice so as to be commensurate. However, then it would\nbe expected that the 0.27 filled band would lock to a \u00d74\nperiod corresponding to a filling of 0.25.\n[18] An alternative explanation is that the relatively large\ncharge transfer into the 0.27 filled band induces significant more lattice strain, thereby lowering its Tc as compared to the \u00d72 CDW.\n\n\f"}
