Possibilities of discovering the corresponding symmetry in experiment are\ndiscussed.\nPACS numbers: PACS numbers: 21.10.-k, 21.60.-n, 21.60.Fw\n\nA possibility that atomic nuclei exhibit tetrahedral\nsymmetry - in quantum physics so far discussed mainly\nas a property of certain molecules, metal clusters or fullerines - has a definite interest for all the related domains of physics. While in the above mentioned objects\nthe underlying interactions are electromagnetic, the nuclear tetrahedra (pyramid-like nuclei with 'rounded edges\nand corners') are expected to be stabilized primarily\nby the strong interactions. Within the nuclear meanfield theories, a convenient framework for discussing this\nphenomenon is provided by the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking mechanism. It is analogous to the one associated with the existence in nature of numerous deformed\nnuclei, e.g. ellipsoidal ones. According to such a mechanism all nuclei are governed by rotationally-invariant\nelementary nucleon-nucleon interactions, yet, for some\nspecific low energy configurations their total energy becomes lower when the corresponding mean-fields take\nnon-spherical shapes. Mathematically different but physically analogous mechanism of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking is related to a discrete symmetry: the inversion. The underlying elementary interactions, although\ninversion-invariant, do not guarantee that all the resulting low energy nuclear configurations lead to stable\ninversion-invariant shapes, and there is a growing experimental evidence of the existence in nature of the octupole\ndeformations, usually pear-shape type, cf. e.g. Ref. [1].\nIt turns out that the tetrahedral nuclei do break spontaneously both the spherical symmetry and the symmetry\nby inversion (see below).\nIn the past there has been a number of studies\npublished that address the question of the non-axially\nsymmetric octupole deformations. Using the Strutinsky method and considering a space composed of 2\n(quadrupole) + 4 (octupole) + 5 (hexadehapole) + 6\n(multipolarity 5) = 17 deformations, the authors of\nRef. [2] have suggested that an ensemble of isomeric\n\nstates of tetrahedral symmetry may exist in the region\nof light Radium nuclei pointing to the importance of the\nso far neglected \u03b132 deformation. Using the HartreeFock approach in their symmetry-unconstrained variant,\nTakami et al., Ref. [3], obtain in some light Z = N nuclei an \u03b132 instability. In Ref. [4] this and other exotic\noctupole deformations were studied in the 32 S nucleus,\nwhile in [5], a similar hypothesis has been advanced theoretically for a group of nuclei around A \u223c 70.\nThe experimental verification of the discussed phenomenon does not exist so far. We believe that the\nmechanism related to \u03b132 deformations is just a 'visible part of an iceberg': a phenomenon whose physical\nconsequences are much richer than what has been discussed so far. First of all, the corresponding TdD symmetry is nearly unique: only TdD and the octahedral OhD\npoint-group symmetries produce in deformed nuclei the\nnucleonic level degeneracies higher that 2. More precisely: some states must carry 2-fold and some 4-fold\ndegeneracies. The corresponding nuclear hamiltonians\nare invariant with respect to the very large number of\n48 different symmetry elements (in the case of the OhD\nthis number would be 96). The depth of the nuclear\nmean-field potential and the number of its bound states\ndepend only very weakly on deformation: the 4-fold degeneracy mechanism at non-zero \u03b132 implies larger interspacing and helps in producing very large shell-gaps\nthat are comparable to or larger than at least some of\nthe gaps at spherical shapes. Moreover, since the argument is geometrical in nature the predicted strong shellgaps propagate all over the periodic table in a repetitive fashion independently of a particular realization of\nthe mean-field approach. This mechanism is far from\nbeing an exoticity of a few nuclei here and there. Its\npresence is predicted in dozens if not hundreds of nuclei.\nAmong unique quantum features it should be noted the\nprediction that some nucleonic orbitals should have the\n\n\f2\n\nD\n\u2022 Deformation \u03b130 : implies the C\u221e\n-symmetry group\nwith infinitely many 1-dimensional irreps., characterized by the so-called K-quantum numbers;\nD\n\u2022 Deformation \u03b131 : implies the C2v\n-symmetry that\ngenerates only 1 two-dimensional irrep;\n\n\u2022 Deformation \u03b132 : implies the TdD -symmetry of 2\n\ntwo-dimensional and 1 four-dimensional irreps;\nD\n\u2022 Deformation \u03b133 : implies the D3h\n-symmetry, and\ngenerates 3 two-dimensional irreps.\n\nProton Energies [MeV]\n\nHowever, the link between the above scheme and the realistic calculations is not always direct - especially when\nthe point-groups rich in structure are concerned. Any\nisomeric minimum is, within the mean-field theory, associated with the presence of energy-gaps in the corresponding single particle spectra - usually the larger the\ngap, the more stable the implied equilibrium deformation.

Another unique element foreseen concerns the\ncollective (especially low spin) rotation of the quantum\ntetrahedra: the corresponding predicted structures of rotational bands will be very different for even (Td -group)\nand odd (TdD -group) nuclei since both the number of the\nirreps associated with these groups and the dimensions\nof the corresponding irreps are very different as well, see\ne.g. Refs. [6, 7].\nThe mathematical background of our considerations\nis well known and can be summarized in a few lines.\nConsider a nuclear deformed mean-field Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u0124(~r, ~p, ~s; \u03b1\u0302) where \u03b1\u0302 represents the ensemble of\nall the deformations {\u03b1\u03bb,\u03bc } and a group of symmetry\nG with the symmetry operators {\u00d41 , \u00d42 , . . . \u00d4f } \u21d4 G,\nso that: [\u0124, \u00d4k ] = 0, for k = 1, 2, . . . f . Suppose\nthat the group in question has irreducible representations {R1 , R2 , . . . Rr } with the dimensions, respectively:\n{ d1 , d2 , . . . dr }. Then the eigenvalues \u03b5\u03bd of the problem\n\u0124 \u03a8\u03bd = \u03b5\u03bd \u03a8\u03bd , \u2200\u03bd, appear in multiplets: d1 -fold degenerate, d2 -fold degenerate, . . . dr -fold degenerate. Since\nthe nuclear mean-field Hamiltonians do not depend explicitly on time, it follows that each eigen-energy must be\nat least twice degenerate (Kramers theorem). In terms\nof irreducible representations of G this property manifests itself for the deformed nuclei through the presence\nof two-dimensional irreducible representations or pairs of\nconjugated one-dimensional ones [7].\nThe point-group symmetries of the nuclear mean-field\nHamiltonian can be very often directly connected to the\ncorresponding deformation parameters: if R(\u03b8, \u03c6) denotes the nuclear surface, expanding it into a series of\nspherical harmonics Y\u03bb\u03bc (\u03b8, \u03c6) with the numerical coefficients \u03b1\u03bb\u03bc (deformation parameters) provides a natural\nclassification scheme. Indeed, setting all \u03b1\u03bb\u03bc to zero one\nobtains a sphere, posing \u03b1\u03bb=2,\u03bc=\u00b12,0 6= 0 gives the most\nD\nimportant example of the ('ellipsoidal') D2h\n-symmetry,\nby setting \u03b1\u03bb=2,3,\u03bc=0 6= 0 we obtain an example of the\nD\noctupole-axial (C\u221e\n) symmetry; many other combinations of the non-zero deformation parameters may lead\nto more 'realistic' realizations of the symmetry groups in\nnuclei. It can be shown using elementary properties of\nthe spherical harmonics that in the case of the pure octupole deformations the following relations between the\nnuclear shape and the double point-group symmetries of\nthe fermion Hamiltonians hold:\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n-9\n-10\n-11\n-12\n\n62\n\n+19 [4,3,1]1/2\n+32 [4,0,4]7/2\n+52 [4,0,0]1/2\n+55 [4,0,2]5/2\n+57 [4,1,1]3/2\n+35 [4,1,1]1/2\n+53 [4,4,0]1/2\n+55 [4,2,2]5/2\n+62 [4,1,3]7/2\n+55 [4,1,3]7/2\n+69 [4,0,4]9/2\n\n56\n\n50\n46\n\n-10 [4,0,2]3/2\n+15 [5,0,5]11/2\n-10 [5,3,2]3/2\n+21 [4,0,0]1/2\n-06 [5,1,4]9/2\n+47 [4,1,1]1/2\n+11 [4,0,2]5/2\n+48 [4,1,1]3/2\n+34 [4,1,3]7/2\n+12 [4,2,2]5/2\n-16 [3,1,2]5/2\n-03 [3,3,0]1/2\n+02 [4,0,4]9/2\n\n40\n\n+00 [4,0,4]9/2\n-33 [3,0,1]1/2\n\n38\n\n-57 [3,0,1]1/2\n-73 [3,0,1]1/2\n-68 [3,1,2]3/2\n-53 [3,0,3]5/2\n-65 [3,0,1]3/2\n-44 [3,1,0]1/2\n\n34\n\n-11 [3,0,3]5/2\n-52 [3,0,1]3/2\n-42 [3,1,0]1/2\n+04 [3,1,0]1/2\n-18 [3,2,1]3/2\n-36 [3,1,2]5/2\n\n28\n\n-61 [3,1,2]3/2\n\n-.2\n\n-.1\n\n.0\n\n.1\n\n.2\n\n.3\n\n.4\n\nDeformation \u03b131\nFIG. 1: Results of the realistic calculation of the proton\nsingle-particle energies in function of the \u03b132 deformation corresponding to the TdD symmetry (top) compared to the analD\nogous dependence in function of \u03b131 (bottom, C2v\n-group).\nThe numbers in front of the Nilsson labels give the expectation values of parity at the extremes of the deformation axes.\nNone of the Nilsson quantum numbers is a good quantum\nnumber at tetrahedral deformations: each label gives the full\nset of quantum numbers of the strongest basis state.

The right-hand side minima (Fig. 2)\n80\n40Zr40\n\n6\n\nTotal Energy [MeV]\n\ntowards an equidistant distribution when deformation increases. If a given group admits only one irreducible\nrepresentation each level can carry at most two nucleons. When the corresponding irreducible representations\nhave higher dimensionality, e.g. four (the corresponding curves are marked with the double Nilsson labels\n[N nz \u039b]\u03a9 in Fig. 1) more particles may reside on one\nsingle energy level, leading, in some other place of the\nenergy scale to effectively diminishing the number of levels and possibly increasing the shell gaps. The features\ndiscussed above are followed very closely by the realistic\ncalculation results of Fig. 1 where, in addition, the extremes on the horizontal axes have been chosen in such a\nway that by comparing the labels on the left- and on the\nright-hand side of the Figure one can read how quickly\nthe parity mixing sets in when the deformation increases\n(the curves are symmetric with respect to 0). The parity mixing at |\u03b132 | \u223c 0.15 is so strong, that the typical\ncalculated parity expectation values are (\u223c \u00b10.5).\nSeveral observations deserve emphasizing. First of all,\nthere is a qualitative difference in the deformation dependence in the two studied cases as predicted by the\nconsiderations based on the point-group symmetries presented above: at |\u03b131 | > 0.15 the level distribution can\nalready be considered 'nearly uniform' except for a relatively small gap at Z = 56 that decreases slowly with increasing deformation. In contrast, the spectrum in function of \u03b132 reveals strongly increasing gaps at Z = 32,\n\u2206E > 2 MeV, at Z = 40 with \u2206E \u223c 3 MeV and a huge\ngap at Z \u2192 56, 58; the latter can be seen as a \u223c 4 MeV\nseparation in the spectrum 'cut across' by a single, usual\n(i.e. twice degenerate) orbital. These deformed gap-sizes\nare comparable to- or larger than- the strongest spherical\ngaps at Z = 20, 28, 40 or even Z = 50, that are known in\nthe medium heavy nuclei; neutron results are similar.\nNot all the gaps have an equal impact on the existence\n(or not) of the well defined minima on the total energy\nsurfaces. More extended calculations whose results will\nnot be presented here in detail can be summarized as\nfollows: The strongest tetrahedral-symmetry effects appear at proton numbers Zt = 16, 20, 32, 40, 56 \u2212 58\u2217 ,\n70\u2217 , 90 \u2212 94\u2217 , where the asterisks denote the gaps that\nare particularly strong (up to \u223c3 MeV or so). A clear\nproton-neutron symmetry exists in the calculations leading to the related tetrahedral neutron gaps at Nt = 16,\n20, 32, 40, 56 \u2212 58\u2217 , 70\u2217 , 90 \u2212 94\u2217 , 112 and 136/142.\nTypically, tetrahedral minima on the total energy surfaces are accompanied by an oblate- and/or a prolatesymmetry minima. The energy cuts corresponding to the\npaths from the tetrahedral minima down to the ground\nstate have been calculated in function of increasing \u03b22 by\nperforming a minimization with respect to the \u03b3 deformation as well as, simultaneously, {\u03b13\u03bc ; \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3}\nand {\u03b14\u03bc ; \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, 10-dimensional minimization, using the standard Strutinsky method.

The gamma deformation as well as all other deformations vary along the \u03b22 -axis following the minimization, for\neach curve separately. The left-hand side insert shows an exaggerated (for better visibility) view of the tetrahedral shape\nat \u03b132 = 0.3, roughly twice the calculated equilibrium deformation. The right-hand side insert shows for comparison an\noblate shape surface at \u03b22 = 0.20, \u03b3 = 600 i.e. roughly at the\ncalculated equilibria.\n\nfor 80 Zr and 160 Yb nuclei are at oblate deformations; the\ncorresponding energies visible in the Figure are, respectively, at 1.4 MeV and \u223c 0.1 MeV above the prolate g.s.\nminima, the latter not shown in order not to perturb\nthe legibility of the figure. For the other two nuclei the\nright-hand side minima correspond directly to the prolate\nground-states; in the Fm case the tetrahedral minimum\nlies paricularly high (7.1 MeV above the g.s.). One can\nsee from the Figure that the calculated barriers are of\nthe order of 1 MeV, similarly to those encountered in the\ncase of the experimentally known prolate/oblate shape\ncoexistence. Unfortunately, lack of information about\nthe collective inertia parameters makes it impossible to\nspeculate about the isomeric half-lives at present.\nAn experimental identification of proposed TdD symmetry may rely on one or combination of several criteria.\nFirst of all, within the class of the single-particle excitations, the presence of the four-fold degeneracies will\nmanifest itself by the presence of a multitude of particlehole transitions of close-lying energies. For instance if\nboth the particle and the hole states are associated to the\nexact-symmetry four-fold degenerate levels, one should\nexpect a sixteen-fold exactly degenerate multiplet of transitions. (In realistic situations the nuclear polarization\neffects are expected to be in general different for various\n1p-1h excitations and the predicted 16-fold degeneracy\nin the associated decay lines will only be approximate) If\n\n\f4\nthe reference configuration was the tetrahedral 0+ state,\nthe corresponding 16 particle-hole excitations will decay\nto it. If as a reference configuration an arbitrary particlehole excited state built on the tetrahedral minimum was\ntaken, say of a given spin-parity I \u03c0 , a family of 2p-2h\nstates can be constructed using similar considerations\nwith the the resulting 16 close-energy transitions feeding this I \u03c0 state. It thus becomes clear that the noncollective decay spectra associated with the tetrahedral\nminima might contain abundantly the approximate 16plets of transitions. Although populating and observing\nsuch multiplets experimentally is by far a non-trivial task\na good news is that the discussed criterion is a 'yes/no'\ncondition - a well defined effect to seek.

In the former case the static dipole moments are often\nstrong thus implying a presence of the collective inter-band\nE1 transitions in addition to the E2 ones. Tetrahedral nuclei\ngenerate no static dipole moments and thus the E1 transitions\nshould be absent in this case.\n\nof the low-lying collective rotational excitations not much\nis known at present as far as nuclear tetrahedral quantum\nrotor behavior is concerned. In a formal treatment of the\nrotational spectra of the tetrahedral symmetry molecules,\n[8] the corresponding rotor Hamiltonians are expanded\nin terms of tensor operators that are constructed out of\n{I\u02c6x , I\u02c6y , I\u02c6z } angular momentum operators. The nuclear\nrotor Hamiltonians can be constructed analogously: we\nhave performed the corresponding calculations and the\npreliminary results indicate characteristic degeneracies of\nthe rotor levels clearly different than those of the 'traditional' ellipsoidal rotors.\nFortunately, qualitative criteria of the 'yes/no' type\ncan be formulated that are related to the rotational decay of the tetrahedral nuclei and this in a nearly modelindependent way. The starting point in the considerations is the so-called simplex-invariance, i.e. the invari-\n\nance of the Hamiltonian with respect to the product of\nparity, \u03c0\u0302 and R\u0302y , a 180o rotation about, say, Oy -axis: \u015c\n= \u03c0\u0302 * R\u0302y . This invariance implies, as discussed in more\ndetail in Ref. [9], that the rotational energies form two\nparity-doublet sequences (four parity-doublet E2-bands)\nas illustrated schematically in Fig. 3. Both the 'usual'\naxial-octupole shape nuclei and the tetrahedral nuclei\nobey to the simplex symmetry and thus must produce\nthe parity-doublet bands. However, the tetrahedral nuclei, in contrast to the 'usual' octupole-type ones are not\nexpected to produce the E1 inter-band transitions since\nthe nuclear pyramids, due to their high symmetry, will\nnot have any significant dipole moments.\nA particularly appealing, 'academic case' possibility\ncorresponds to a pure tetrahedral symmetry with no\nother multipole deformations present. In such an ideal\ncase the dipole and quadrupole moments are expected to\nbe zero and the first non-vanishing moments will have\n\u03bb = 3. In such a case the parity-doublet energies at the\nright-hand side in Fig. 3 would be connected by pure\nE3-transitions rather than E2-transitions.\nIn summary: We suggest that the tetrahedral symmetry in nuclei should be present among many isomeric\nstates throughout the periodic table. We predict the proton and neutron numbers for which this effect should be\nthe strongest. The four-fold TdD degeneracy of related\ndeformed nucleonic orbitals is a unique feature - only the\ninversion-conserving octahedral OhD symmetry may provide in deformed nuclei the degeneracies higher than two\n(more precisely: four-fold).\n\n[1] P.
