As this astrophysical process, which produces\nabout half of the heavy elements in the universe, runs through nuclei with\nextreme neutron excesses, most of the needed cross sections are not experimentally known and have to be modelled. Such estimates are usually done on\nthe basis of the statistical Hauser-Feshbach [1,2,3,4] model and require, as one\nof the important ingredients, the modelling of the electromagnetic transition\nstrength from nuclear states above the neutron threshold. Often dipole transitions contribute dominantly to the cross sections. In the absence of experimental data, these dipole strength distributions for neutron-rich nuclei have\nbeen conventionally described by Lorentzians with an energy- or temperaturedependent width [5,6,7] and parameters derived from data for stable nuclei.\nObviously deviations from the parametrized Lorentzian at energies around the\nneutron threshold can lead to significant modifications of the neutron capture\ncross sections. As noted first by Goriely [8], such effects can arise from the\nso-called pygmy resonance which leads to an enhancement of the low-lying E1\nstrength, potentially in the astrophysically important energy range. In fact,\nan enhancement of the E1 strength at excitation energies Ex below 10 MeV\nhas been experimentally observed for neutron-rich nuclei relative to the one\nfor stable nuclei. Prominent examples are the tin isotopes where the neutronrich nuclei 129\u2212132 Sn exhibit a noticeable portion of the total E1 strength at\nEx < 10 MeV, in contrast to the stable isotopes 116,120 Sn [9]. Theoretically\nthese tendencies are well reproduced by calculations based on the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) on top of the Hartree-Fock plus\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (HF-BCS) [10] or of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov\n(HFB) [11] approaches and by the relativistic QRPA (RQRPA) calculations\n[12] and are usually explained as so-called pygmy resonances in which the excess neutrons oscillate against the isospin-saturated core. Significant progress\nhas been achieved very recently by extending the RQRPA by the quasiparticlephonon coupling model using the Relativistic Quasiparticle Time Blocking\nApproximation (RQTBA). As it has been demonstrated in [13], this extended\napproach reproduces the experimental E1 strength distributions in general\nvery well, inluding the observed low-lying strength It has been also found\nthat isotopic dependence of the excitation energy and the integrated strength\nof the pygmy dipole resonance agrees well with previous theoretical studies\n[14,15]. Ref. [16] has shown that once the theoretical strength distributions\nare corrected for the experimental detector response and in particular for the\nfact that Coulomb dissociation experiments can only access strength above\n2\n\n\fthe neutron threshold, the data for 130 Sn and 132 Sn [17] are nicely reproduced.\nThis motivates us to use this model to calculate the E1 strength distributions\nfor the chains of tin and nickel isotopes, including nuclei close and on the\nr-process path for which data do not exist, yet. The focus of our studies is\non the effect of enhanced low-lying dipole strength on neutron capture cross\nsections, in particular for neutron-rich nuclei. Our calculations are based on\nthe statistical model which we briefly describe in the next section. In section\n3 we present the RQTBA dipole strength functions and compare them with\nstandard Lorentzian parametrizations [3] and with the QRPA calculations of\nRef. [10]. The impact of different dipole strength distributions on neutroncapture rates for the nickel and tin isotopes is also discussed.\n\n2\n\nFormalism\n\nThe Hauser-Feshbach expression for the cross section of an (n, \u03b3) reaction\nproceeding from the target nucleus i in the state \u03bc with spin Ji\u03bc and parity\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03c0i\u03bc to a final state \u03bd with spin Jm\nand parity \u03c0m\nin the residual nucleus m via\na compound state with excitation energy E, spin J, and parity \u03c0 is given by\n(see also [2,3,18])\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c3(n,\u03b3)\n(Ei,n )\n\nX\nTn\u03bc T\u03b3\u03bd\n\u03c0~2\n1\n=\n,\n(2J + 1)\n2Mi,n Ei,n (2Ji\u03bc + 1)(2Jn + 1) J,\u03c0\nTtot\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ei,n and Mi,n are the center-of-mass energy and the reduced mass for the\ninitial system. Jn = 1/2 is the neutron spin. For (n, \u03b3) reactions the residual\nand the compound nucleus are the same. The transmission coefficients Tn\u03bc =\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nTn (E, J, \u03c0; Ei\u03bc , Ji\u03bc , \u03c0i\u03bc ), T\u03b3\u03bd = T\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0; Em\n, Jm\n, \u03c0m\n) describe the transitions\nfrom the compound state - characterized by (E, J, \u03c0) - to the initial and final\nstate, respectively. The sum of the transmission coefficients over all possible\nexit-channels is given by Ttot . It is possible to derive the laboratory cross\nsection (the target is in its ground state, e.g. \u03bc = 0) from Eq. (1) by summing\nover all possible final states \u03bd in the residual nucleus. Therefore it is convenient\nto introduce transmission coefficients which only depend on the compound\nquantum numbers:\nT\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nT\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0; Em\n, Jm\n, \u03c0m\n).\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bd\n\nGenerally the discrete energy spectrum is only partially known and consequently above a certain excitation energy a level density description is applied. In that case the sum in Eq. (2) translates into a discrete sum plus an\nintegration over the level density [2,3,18]:\n3\n\n\fT\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0) =\n+\n\n\u03ba\nX\n\n\u03bd=0\nZE\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nT\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0; Em\n, Jm\n, \u03c0m\n)\n\nX\n\n(3)\n\nT\u03b3 (E, J, \u03c0; Em , Jm , \u03c0m )\u03c1(Em , Jm , \u03c0m )dEm .\n\n\u03ba Jm ,\u03c0m\nEm\n\n\u03ba\nwhere Em\nis the excitation energy of the last experimentally known state, \u03ba,\nin the nucleus m.\n\nIn the calculation of the transmission coefficient we closely follow the formalism as described in [3,19]. In particular we consider parity-dependent level\ndensities for initial, compound and final states, here following [20]. The paritydependent level densities were taken from Hilaire and Goriely as calculated\nwithin a combinatorial approach on top of HFB single particle energies [21].\nWe note that using a standard backshifted Fermi gas level density [4,3] with\na parity-dependence as introduced in [22] gives quite similar results.\nThe \u03b3-transmission coefficient for the decay to a state \u03bd involves a sum over\nall possible photon multipolarities. For a given multipolarity, XL, and photon\nenergy E\u03b3 = E \u2212E \u03bd , the transmission coefficient is related with the \u03b3-strength\nfunction, fXL , via\nTXL (E, J, \u03c0, E \u03bd , J \u03bd , \u03c0 \u03bd ) = TXL (E, E\u03b3 ) = 2\u03c0E\u03b32L+1 fXL (E, E\u03b3 ).\n\n(4)\n\nIn this paper we mainly focus on E1 transitions, although the M1 contributions\nhave been calculated as well using the single-particle approach [2,23]. Both\nmultipolarities usually dominate for neutron capture reactions at astrophysical\nenergies.\nIn general, the strength function depends on the initial and final states. However, in practical applications, one usually adopts the Brink-Axel hypothesis\nwhich assumes that the strength function is independent of the detailed structure of the initial state and consequently depends only on E\u03b3 and not on\nE [24,25,26]. Assuming that the photoabsorption process does not depend on\nthe spin of the final state, it is possible to relate the cross section, \u03c3XL , to the\n\u03b3-strength function:\nfXL (E, E\u03b3 ) = fXL (E\u03b3 ) =\n\n1 \u03c3XL (E\u03b3 )\n* E\u03b3\u22122L+1 .\n2\n2L + 1 (\u03c0~c)\n\n(5)\n\nAccording to Eq. (5), the \u03b3-strength function and the absorption cross section\nfor E1 transitions are connected via\n\u03c3E1 (E\u03b3 ) = 3\u03c0 2 (~c)2 E\u03b3 fE1 (E\u03b3 ).\n\n(6)\n4\n\n\fIn statistical model calculations one usually assumes that the E1 strength\ndistribution can be approximated by a Lorentzian adjusted to reproduce the\nposition and width of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) [2,19,3,6,7]:\nfE1 (E\u03b3 ) =\n\n4 e2 1 NZ\n\u0393E\u03b3\n(1 + \u03c7)\n2\n2\n3\u03c0 ~c mc A (EE1 \u2212 E\u03b32 )2 + (E\u03b3 \u0393)2\n\n(7)\n\nwith N, Z and A = N + Z being the neutron, proton and nucleon numbers of\nthe compound nucleus. Here \u03c7 \u2248 0.2 is a factor that accounts for the neutronproton exchange contribution (see e.g., [27]). The parameters EE1 and \u0393 are\nobtained by adjustment to data for the giant dipole resonance (see e.g., [28]) or,\nif data are not available, from theoretical model predictions or systematics [3].\nThe Lorentzian approach is known to be inaccurate in the low-energy region\nas the low energy tail of the Lorentzian usually overestimates the strength\nat these energies. In practical applications one therefore modifies the width\nof the GDR, \u0393, to account for these deficiencies. Various treatments have\nbeen developed over the past decades (for an overview see [6] and references\ntherein). Hereq\nwe follow [5] and define an energy-dependent width parameter\nas: \u0393(E\u03b3 ) = \u0393 E\u03b3 /EE1 .\nWe have calculated RQTBA E1 strength functions as outlined in [13] and used\nthem in combination with Eqs. (4,6) to obtain transmission coefficients for the\nE1 transitions. In the RQTBA, excitations in even-even nuclei are determined\nby the nuclear response function R(\u03c9) whose matrix elements obey the BetheSalpeter equation (BSE) of the following form [13]:\n(0)\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\nRk\u03b7\u03b71 k4 ,k2 k3 (\u03c9) = R\u0303k1 k2 (\u03c9)\u03b4k1 k3 \u03b4k2 k4 \u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032\n(0)\u03b7\n\n+ R\u0303k1 k2 (\u03c9)\n\nXX\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032 \u2032\n\nW\u0304k\u03b7\u03b71 k6 ,k2 k5 (\u03c9)Rk\u03b75k\u03b74 ,k6 k3 (\u03c9),\n\n(8)\n\nk5 k6 \u03b7\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere indices ki run over single-particle quantum numbers including states in\nthe Dirac sea and indices \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032, \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 numerate forward (+) and backward (\u2212)\ncomponents in the quasiparticle space. Pairing correlations are treated in the\nBCS approximation. The quantity R\u0303(0) (\u03c9) describes free propagation of two\nquasiparticles in the mean field and matrix elements of the amplitude W\u0304 read:\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nW\u0304k\u03b7\u03b71 k4 ,k2 k3 (\u03c9) = \u1e7ck\u03b7\u03b7\n+ \u03a6\u03b7k1 k4 ,k2 k3 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u03a6\u03b7k1 k4 ,k2 k3 (0) \u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 .\n1 k4 ,k2 k3\n\n(9)\n\nIn Eq.

(6) which is used for the\nstatistical model calculations.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nWe have calculated statistical model cross sections for (n, \u03b3) reactions on tin\nand nickel isotopes using four different models to describe the dipole strength\nfunction. Our default model (model A) is the RQTBA which, as demonstrated\nin [13], reproduces experimental photo absorption cross sections very well, including the low-energy cross sections, which is of special interest for the discussion here. To account effectively for the residual effect of higher configurations\nbeyond RQTBA, a 200 keV imaginary part has been included in the energy\nvariable of Eq. (10). As the model is currently restricted to even-even nuclei,\nwe will in the following only discuss neutron capture cross sections for odd-A\nnickel and tin isotopes. Following Refs. [2,3,19] we describe the dipole strength\nby a Lorentzian form of Eq. (7) with the energy dependent width parameter\nas defined above. The centroid EE1 and total strength are adjusted to the\nRQTBA strength function (model B). Although the width parameter is taken\nfrom Ref. [30], it gives a good reproduction of the RQTBA strength function\n6\n\n\fin the GDR region. A comparison between models A and B allows to disentangle the influence of the low-energy strength on the neutron capture cross\nsections. Finally, we have performed calculations using the Lorentzian form of\nEq. (7) but with the strength parameters determined as described in Ref. [3]\n(Model C) and calculations adopting the dipole strength functions of Ref. [10],\nwhich have been derived by a QRPA approach on top of a Hartree-Fock-BCS\nmodel (model D).\n-6\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n-3\n\nfE1 [MeV ]\n\n106\n-9\n\n10\n10\n\n116\n\nSn\n\nSn\n\n-10\n-6\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n140\n\nSn\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n132\n-9\n\n10\n10\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\nSn\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nE\u03b3 [MeV]\n\nFig. 1. \u03b3 strength functions for selected tin isotopes as calculated by the RQTBA\napproach (solid; model A) [13] and the QRPA model of Goriely and Khan [10]\n(dashed; model D). The dotted curves show the Lorentzian parametrization of the\nstrength as proposed in [3] (model C) and the dash-dotted curves correspond to a\nLorentzian with the width taken from [3], the centroid taken from the RQTBA\nresults and the total strength adjusted to the RQTBA results, as explained in\nthe text (model B). The dotted vertical lines indicate the (experimental) neutron\nthreshold energies.\n\nFig. 1 shows the dipole \u03b3 strength functions for the four different models and\nselected tin isotopes. We note that models A and D reproduce the known\nphotoabsorption cross section data for tin isotopes quite well [13,16]. While\nthe parametrized strength function of Ref. [3] agrees nicely with the microscopic 116 Sn strength functions, it predicts a centroid energy which is somewhat higher for the neutron-rich tin isotope 132 Sn than obtained in the other\nmodels.\nComparing the various model predictions it is most striking that the microscopic model predicts quite noticeable nuclear structure effects which result\nin a rather strong fragmentation of the strength function. This is mainly due\n7\n\n\fto the quasiparticle-phonon coupling explicitly considered in the RQTBA approach [13]. Comparing the microscopic strength functions (model A) with\nthe Lorentzian approximation of model B, we note that for most nuclei the\nparametrization overestimates the microscopic strength function at low energies, say E < 5 MeV. This indicates that the empirical energy-dependence\nof the width parameter [5] is not supported by the microscopic model. This\nconclusion is also supported by the QRPA results which are generally slightly\nsmaller than the RQTBA results at the lowest energies. The standard parametrization utilized in [3] agrees quite well with the model B parametrization. However, with increasing neutron excess this model predicts the centroid at higher\nenergies than the other models. Consequently, the \u03b3 strength function for 140 Sn\nin model C is smaller at low energies than in the other models.\nAs the RQTBA model includes phonon couplings which are absent in the\nQRPA model it resolves more nuclear structure details. This can lead to fluctuations in the \u03b3 strength function around the neutron threshold and below.\nAn example is given by the nucleus 116 Sn (see Fig. 1) where the RQTBA model\npredicts a mild enhancement of the strength just at the neutron threshold\nwhich is absent in the QRPA model and, of course, in the parametrizations of\nmodels B and C. As the neutron separation energies move to lower energies\nwith increasing neutron excess within a chain of isotopes, low-lying E1 strength\nas observed experimentally for the tin isotopes 130,132 Sn and found within\nour microscopic RQTBA approach for neutron-rich nuclei can influence the\n\u03b3 strength function around the neutron threshold significantly. A prominent\nexample is 132 Sn where the RQTBA approach predicts a strong enhancement\nof the E1 strength around the neutron separation energy of E = 7.3 MeV.\nSuch an increased strength is not predicted by the other models used in this\npaper (the relativistic QRPA calculations of Ref. [12] predict also additional\nstrength at low energies) and, as we will see below, has a noticeable effect on\nthe neutron capture cross sections. For 140 Sn the RQTBA model also predicts\na strong fragmentation of the \u03b3 strength at low energies E & 5 MeV with\nenhanced strength compared to the strengths of the other models. However,\nfor this nucleus the neutron threshold is already quite low (Eth = 3.5 MeV)\nand this enhancement will only have modest effect on the cross sections.\nBy inserting the \u03b3 strength functions into Eqs. (1) and (4) we have calculated cross sections for neutron capture on the ground states of the isotopes\n105,115,131,139\nSn arising solely from dipole transitions. The results are shown\nin Fig. 2 for neutron energies of up to 20 MeV (note that the maximum\nneutron energies reached in the r-process discussed below are of the order of\n80 \u2212 100 keV). In order to understand the impact of various magnitudes of\n\u03b3 strengths it is necessary to realize what the relevant \u03b3-ray energies are. It\nis well known that capture reactions proceeding via the compound reaction\nmechanism result in a \u03b3-ray cascade with a dominant contribution coming\nfrom \u03b3 rays with only a few MeV, below the neutron separation energy Sn .\n8\n\n\f10\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n\u03c3lab [b]\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n105\n\nSn(n,\u03b3)\n\n106\n\n115\n\nSn\n\nSn(n,\u03b3)\n\n116\n\nSn\n\n-4\n\n10\n-1\n10\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n131\n\nSn(n,\u03b3)\n\n132\n\n139\n\nSn\n\nSn(n,\u03b3)\n\n140\n\nSn\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10 10\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\nEn,lab. [MeV]\n\nFig. 2. Cross sections for (n, \u03b3)-reactions on various tin isotopes based on E1 strength\nfunctions as derived in different models, see Fig. 1 and text.\n\nRecently, Ref. [31], assuming the validity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis and a\nLorentzian parametrization of the dipole strength, has shown that this also\nholds for neutron-rich targets with dominant E1 strength leading to levels at\n3-4 MeV below Sn unless the density of levels accessible by E1 transition is\nlow. In the latter case, \u03b3 transitions with the maximally possible energy of\nSn + En may dominate. This nicely explains the dependences we find in our\ncalculations. For the cases of neutron captures on 105 Sn and 115 Sn the dominating \u03b3 transitions display an energy of E\u03b3 \u2248 3 + En MeV with dominant\nE1 transition endpoints at \u2248 3 MeV below Sn . Scanning through En , we can\nnicely see in Figs. 1,2 how the larger strength functions of the two parametrized\ndescriptions (models B and C) result in larger cross sections than those obtained with the microscopic approaches RQTBA and QRPA (models A and\nD), until the predictions converge close to Sn . The RQTBA model predicts\na strong fragmentation of the dipole strength at low energies. However, this\nis not seen in the cross sections because the relevant range of available \u03b3 energies averages and smoothes the impact of the fluctuations. The small kink\nappearing in the 115 Sn cross section at En = 0.5 MeV is due to the opening of\nthe (n, p) channel.\nConsistent with [31], we find a different behavior in the cross sections of 131 Sn.\nThe low level density of the doubly magic compound (and final) nucleus 132 Sn\ncauses the dominance of \u03b3 transitions directly to the ground state, with E\u03b3 =\nSn +En . Up to En < 1 MeV the influence of the RQTBA pygmy peak explains\nwhy the RQTBA yields the by far largest cross sections up to that energy.\n9\n\n\fAbove that energy, the RQTBA \u03b3 strength drops below the strengths predicted\nby the other models and consequently the resulting cross section becomes\nthe smallest. After another 2 \u2212 3 MeV (note that Fig. 1 uses a linear and\nFig. 2 a logarithmic energy scale), the RQTBA predicts a larger \u03b3 strength\nagain and consequently its respective cross section becomes the largest again.\nInterestingly, a second effect is overlaid on top of the general strength function\nbehavior and giving rise to the decrease in cross sections found for all models\naround 2 MeV neutron energy. The level density description [21] predicts a\nrelatively low density of negative parity states at excitation energies around\n9 MeV in 132 Sn. In consequence, magnetic dipole transitions to the low-lying\npositive parity states dominate (not shown in Fig. 2). This is an example for\nthe importance of the complete inclusion of parity-dependent level densities.\nExcept for the parity effect, the behavior of the 139 Sn(n, \u03b3) cross section can\nbe explained similarly to the one of 131 Sn. The level density below Sn is very\nlow for such a neutron-rich nucleus and therefore the relevant \u03b3 energies are\nE\u03b3 = Sn + En . The strong pygmy peak predicted by the RQTBA is also\nclearly seen in the cross section. Smaller fluctuations are dampened and the\ngeneral strong decrease in the cross section at the high energy end is typical\nfor Hauser-Feshbach cross sections, as in the other reactions considered here.\nIn addition, for 139 Sn we find that the M1 contribution to the capture cross\nsection exceeds the dipole part at low neutron energies (say En < 100 keV).\nThus, at these energies the total cross sections are less affected by the differences in the dipole strength functions. However, our statistical model code\nuses a rather simple description of M1 transitions based on a single particle\ntreatment [2,23]. A more appropriate treatment, which includes the concentration of the M1 strength around E = 7\u201310 MeV due to spin excitations and\nin addition considers the pronounced orbital contribution seen in deformed\nnuclei (scissors mode [32]) is called for.\nThe classical r-process operates at a typical stellar temperature of order 109 K [3].\nTo estimate which impact the enhanced low-energy dipole strength could have\non neutron capture rates under astrophysical conditions, we have calculated\nthe stellar neutron capture rate h\u03c3vi, where \u03c3 is the neutron capture cross section, v is the relative velocity of the fusing nuclei in the initial channel and the\nsymbol h...i indicates proper averaging over the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity\ndistributions of the two nuclei at the stellar temperature and accounting for\nthe thermal population of excited states. In Fig. 3 we compare ratios of neutron capture rates as obtained in the four different models at a temperature of\nT = 109 K. The capture rates have been computed neglecting M1 transitions\ndue to their rather simple treatment in our statistical code (see paragraph\nabove). We observe that rates calculated with the parametrized E1 strengths\nare usually larger than our RQTBA results with the noticeable exception\nfor the isotopes 130,132 Sn (capturing the neutron on 129,131 Sn).

For\ndescriptions of the models, see text.\n\n(QRPA, model D) generally predicts smaller rates than the parametrization\nmodels one might conclude that the parametrization of the dipole strength\nfunctions with the energy dependence as defined above seems to predict too\nlarge strength at low gamma energies (except for the most neutron-rich tin\nisotope, 140 Sn, considered in this work) and hence overestimates the rates,\ncompared to microscopic models. Interestingly, we do not observe by comparison of the four models that the low-lying strength is more important in\nneutron-rich nuclei as, for example, the parametrized strength of model B exceeds the RQTBA results by about the same amount in the neutron deficient\nand stable tin isotopes as it does in the very neutron-rich ones (133\u2212137 Sn).\nWe have also performed calculations of dipole strength functions, cross sections\nand neutron capture rates at T = 109 K for the even neutron-rich nickel isotopes 68\u221278 Ni. A comparison of the rates obtained in our four different models is\nshown in Fig. 4. The findings are quite similar to those for the tin isotopes. For\nall isotopes the rates calculated with the parametrized dipole strength (models\nB and C) exceeds those obtained on the basis of the RQTBA strength functions, again pointing to a non-adequate description of the low-lying strength\nby the energy dependent width parameter as chosen in [3]. Except for the capture on 67 Ni, the agreement between the two microscopic approaches (models\nA and D) is quite satisfactory. The Lorentzian parametrization slightly overestimates the microscopic rates. We note, however, that for the heaviest nickel\nnuclei the parametrization used within Ref. [3] predicts the centroid of the\ngiant dipole resonance at slightly higher energies.

The largest effect we find for the capture on the tin isotopes\n129,131\nSn (caused by low-lying dipole strength in 130,132 Sn) where our microscopic RQTBA model predicts noticeable enhanced strength just around the\nenergies of the neutron threshold, leading to an increase in the capture rate\nby factors 2\u20135 compared to the other models considered here.\nThe coincidence that the enhanced E1 strength lies around the neutron threshold in 132 Sn and a large portion of the transitions goes to the daughter ground\nstate (due to suppression of excited states at modest excitation energies in\nthis double-magic nucleus) results in a large enhancement of the reaction rate\nin the RQTBA model compared to the other models. As the RQTBA strength\nfunction for 132 Sn nicely agrees with data (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [16]), this change\nin the capture rate should be adopted in future r-process simulations.\n12\n\n\f4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have obtained E1 strength functions for nickel and tin isotopes based\non the microscopic RQTBA approach which has been proven previously to\ngive a good description of data, including those for the neutron-rich tin isotopes 130,132 Sn. These data show E1 strengths at energies around the neutron\nthreshold which are enhanced compared to the expectations from a Lorentzian\nparametrization of the giant resonance. As it has been pointed out before that\nsuch enhanced dipole strengths could have noticeable effects on neutron capture rates for r-process nuclei, we have calculated the respective capture cross\nsections for the relevant nickel and tin isotopes (67\u221277 Ni and 129\u2212139 Sn) and\nhave compared the RQTBA results with rates obtained either within the nonrelativistic QRPA on the basis of Hartree-Fock plus BCS calculations or by\nempirical parametrizations. Usually we find rather good agreement between\nthe two microscopic models. Noticeable exceptions are 129,131 Sn, and in particular the capture rates to 132 Sn are noticeably larger within the RQTBA model\nthan in all other models, which is caused by the enhanced dipole strength in\nthis nucleus at energies above the neutron threshold. We note, however, that\nour calculation of the capture rates are based on the Brink-Axel hypothesis,\nwhich is common in statistical model evaluations of neutron capture rates for\nr-process applications. Within this hypothesis an enhanced dipole strength\naround the neutron threshold translates to enhanced neutron capture cross\nsections only if transitions to the ground state dominate. If the capture leads\nto excited states instead the strength function at appropriate lower energies is\nrelevant. However, the transition strength for excited states could be different\nthan for the ground state at the moderate energies relevant to neutron capture,\ninvalidating the Brink-Axel hypothesis. Consequently, tests of this hypothesis\nfor dipole transitions, similar to those performed for Gamow-Teller transitions\nin Ref. [33] are welcome.\nTwo final remarks are in order. At first, the RQTBA model predicts fragmentation and low-lying strengths also in the neutron-rich isotopes, however, not\nat the low energies close to the neutron threshold. Whether further correlations beyond the RQTBA model will further push strength to lower energies\nand hence might enhance the dipole cross sections at low neutron energies is an\nopen question and must wait until appropriate nuclear models can be applied\nto such nuclei. Secondly, we have also calculated the contributions of other\nmultipoles to the neutron capture rate and find that for the tin isotopes beyond 132 Sn, which have quite low neutron thresholds, M1 transitions dominate\nin our calculations making the observed differences in the dipole cross sections\nunimportant for the total cross sections due to our use of parity-dependent\nlevel densities [20]. However, we note that our statistical model code describes\nM1 transitions in the so-called single-particle treatment. The calculation of the\nM1 transitions should generally be improved by using M1 strength functions\n13\n\n\fwhich resemble the experimentally observed energy distribution with strong\nspin contributions around excitation energies of order 7\u201310 MeV and orbital\ncontributions at low energies, including the pronounced scissors mode [32] in\ndeformed nuclei at excitation energies of E \u2248 2\u20133 MeV, i.e. around neutron\nthreshold energies in very neutron-rich nuclei.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is partly supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through\ncontract SFB 634 \"Nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics and fundamental\nexperiments at small momentum transfers at the S-DALINAC\".
