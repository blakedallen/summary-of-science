Specifically, our results establish a unique\nway to obtain colossal magnetodielectricity, independent of any striction effects, by engineering\nthe asymmetric hopping contribution to the dielectric constant via the tuning of the relative spin\norientations between neighboring magnetic ions in a transition metal oxide system. We discuss the\nrole of antisite (Ni-Mn) disorder in emergence of these unusual properties.\n\nMagnetodielectric compounds, whose dielectric properties depend on the applied magnetic field, and which\nexhibit such effects near the room temperature, hold\ngreat promise for future device applications [1\u20133]. However, such materials are rare, since the electronic origins of spontaneous magnetic and electric dipolar orderings are generally mutually exclusive [4]. Significant\nmagnetodielectric effects have recently been observed in\nspin-spiral systems, such as TbMnO3 [5] and CuO [6] at\ntemperatures well below the room temperature and in\ncharge-ordered systems, such as LuFe2 O4 [7]. In this letter, we show that partially-disordered La2 NiMnO6 has\nan array of highly interesting properties, such as a disordered ferromagnetism at higher temperatures and a\nreentrant spin-glass transition at lower temperatures, a\nrelaxor-type dielectric behavior, defining this system as\na rare example of an intrinsic multi-glass system in contrast to Mn-doped SrTiO3 [8, 9]. We show that this system is a good insulator with a colossal magnetodielectric\ncoupling (up to \u223c 20%) over a wide temperature range\nincluding the room temperature, and no significant magnetoresistance. We discuss the essential role played by\nthe disorder in the form of antisite defects between Ni and\nMn ions in interrelating these diverse properties. Specifically, we show that there is a substantial contribution to\nthe dielectric constant from the mechanism of asymmetric hopping. Therefore, magnetodielectric coupling can\nbe engineered in such systems due to the sensitivity of\nasymmetric hopping on the relative spin orientations of\nneighboring sites. This offers a new and general way to\nengineer magnetodielectric systems, independent of any\nkind of magnetostriction or electrostriction effects.\nPartially-disordered La2 NiMnO6 is synthesized in the\n\nmonoclinic (P 21 /n) space group by the Pechini method\n[10]. This is in contrast to the sample reported in ref.[11],\nwhich is almost fully ordered, arising from differences\nin details of the synthetic procedure. Rietveld refinement confirms the pure monoclinic (P 21 /n) La2 NiMnO6\n(LNMO) phase formation, which has two crystallographic sites for the B-site cations, Ni and Mn. Fieldcooled (FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) DC magnetic\nmeasurements and AC susceptibility measurements were\nperformed using an MPMS SQUID magnetometer from\nQuantum Design, USA. X-ray absorption spectra were\ncollected in total electron yield mode at the I1011 beamline at the Swedish national syncrotron source MAX-lab.\nDielectric constant measurements were performed in the\ntemperature range from 10 K to 300 K and over the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz using an Agilent\nimpedance analyzer. Dielectric constant measurements\nperformed with sputtered gold or silver paste as electrodes gave similar results, ruling out any electrode polarization contribution. Magnetodielectric measurements\nwere performed by recording dielectric constants in presence of a magnetic field of 2 Tesla.\nFor double perovskite structures with a general formula of A2 BB \u2032 O6 , it is well-known that antisite disorder\nwith an interchange between B and B \u2032 sites has profound effects on physical properties, particularly magnetic properties [12\u201315]. Specifically in the case of\nLa2 NiMnO6 antisite disorder leads to Mn4+ -O2\u2212 -Mn4+\nand Ni2+ -O2\u2212 -Ni2+ antiferromagnetic couplings, while\nthe predominant Ni2+ -O2\u2212 -Mn4+ of the ordered structure is ferromagnetic.

On the other\nhand, the low field ZFC and FC magnetization curves\n(Fig.1a) of our partially-disordered LNMO sample reveal\na ferromagnetic transition at about 270 K and an ad-\n\nditional anomaly at a lower temperature. Quite similar\nmagnetization results on partially-disordered LNMO [10]\nhave been interpreted based on the presence of two ferromagnetic phases in the sample, namely one containing\nNi2+ - Mn4+ ions with a Tc \u223c 270 K, the other with\nNi3+ - Mn3+ with Tc \u223c 100 K. However, X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) experiments, a characteristic\nfingerprinting tool for valence determination [16], shown\nin Fig.2 and our first-principles calculations, show the\npresence of only Ni2+ - Mn4+ ions in the LNMO sample. Thus, DC magnetization data of LNMO, combined\nwith XAS results, clearly illustrate the inadequacy of previous hypotheses related to the origin of magnetism in\nLNMO, suggesting a single magnetic phase in this material. While earlier reports attributed the observation\nof two magnetic features to the presence of two phases\nwith distinctly different electronic and magnetic properties, implying an inhomogeneous sample, our work, in\ncontrast, establishes these two magnetic features as intrinsic parts of a homogeneous system in the presence of\nantisite defects. In order to investigate the nature of this\nmagnetism further, AC susceptibility measurements were\nperformed on LNMO samples. Both real (\u03c7\u2032 not shown\nfor brevity) and imaginary (\u03c7\u2032\u2032 ) parts of AC susceptibility\ndata, measured with applied magnetic field frequencies\nof 17 and 170 Hz, as shown in Fig.1b, show a sharp frequency independent ferromagnetic transition around 270\nK. The presence of a frequency dependent peak below\n150 K, shown in detail in Fig.1c for various frequencies,\nsuggest the presence of dynamical features at low temperatures. In order to investigate whether LNMO also\nexhibits aging, memory and rejuvenation effects, characteristic properties of spin-glass compounds [17, 18],\nDC memory experiments were performed. These experiments are performed by comparing the DC ZFC magnetization curves collected with and without an intermediate\nwait at a specific temperature (TW ). For spin-glasses, a\ndistinct dip is observed in the difference ZFC plot, at TW ,\nreflecting the rearrangement of the spin configuration\nduring the halt in the ZFC cooling, and that this equilibration, or aging, has been kept in memory [19]. The dip\nin the difference ZFC plot at TW for DC memory experiments, shown in Fig.1d, conclusively shows that LNMO\nexhibits spin-glass like dynamics at low temperatures.\nHence, LNMO behaves like a re-entrant spin glass or\nre-entrant ferromagnet, exhibiting successive transitions\nfrom paramagnetic to ferromagnetic, and ferromagnetic\nto spin glass states [20] with a lowering of the temperature. The existence of the low-temperature glassy state\nimplies that the ferromagnetic state established at higher\ntemperatures, in presence of antisite disorders, is magnetically frustrated, since the presence of antisite disorders\nalso leads to super-exchange mediated antiferromagnetic\ninteractions between Mn4+ -O2\u2212 -Mn4+ and Ni2+ -O2\u2212 Ni2+ .

However, it was found to\noriginate from two distinctly different magnetic phases\nin the sample [21], implying an inhomogeneous sample,\nsimilar to earlier suggestions concerning the two magnetic transitions in La2 NiMnO6 . Thus, these earlier reports are fundamentally different from the present study\nwhere we establish that a reentrant spin-glass magnetism\noriginates within a magnetically homogenous phase.\nThe dielectric constant of partially-disordered LNMO,\nmeasured as a function of temperature for various applied frequencies (Fig.3a), show the presence of dominant frequency-dependent dielectric relaxations, though\nit is small and relatively frequency independent below\n100 K. The presence of strong dielectric relaxations is\nalso seen in the corresponding loss (tan \u03b4 = D) data,\ngiven in Fig. 3b. To analyze the origin of observed dielectric relaxations, we first note that in the frequency\nrange probed in these experiments, dielectric relaxations\ncan arise from two independent mechanisms: (a) it can\narise from dipolar contributions originating from asymmetric hopping of charge carriers [22, 23] (between Ni2+\nand Mn4+ sites), in the presence of an electric field. This\nis expected to give rise to a Debye relaxation [22]. (b) Dielectric relaxations can also originate from the presence of\naccumulated charge carriers between regions in the sam-\n\nple having different conductivities such as near the grain\nboundaries. This extrinsic source of dielectric relaxations\nis known as Maxwell-Wagner relaxations [24]. MaxwellWagner polarization mechanism can be easily identified\nby its characteristic f \u22121 dependence of the imaginary\npart of dielectric constant data (\u01eb\u2032\u2032 ) at lower frequencies\n[24], whereas the Debye part of \u01eb\u2032\u2032 data goes to zero. The\nslope of log(\u01eb\u2032\u2032 ) vs. log(f ) is found to be (\u22121) at low frequencies, as shown for 300 K in the inset to Fig. 3b,\nclearly suggesting the presence of Maxwell-Wagner relaxation. However, a Maxwell-Wagner relaxation model,\nfails to fit the dielectric relaxation at higher frequencies\n(see the comparison between experimental data and the\nbest fit with the Maxwell-Wagner polarization in Fig.\n3c). This suggests that additional high frequency relaxation processes exist in partially-disordered LNMO. The\npresence of two relaxations are also evident from Fig.\n3a, where two dielectric relaxations, A and B, are clearly\nvisible, as marked. A combined relaxation mechanism,\nincorporating both Maxwell-Wagner and Debye relaxations, reproduces the experimental spectra well over the\ncomplete frequency and temperature ranges, as shown in\nFig. 3d. The Debye relaxation times extracted from the\nfits, correspond to an activated behavior with an activation energy of 120 meV. This is close to the activation\nenergy of 160 meV determined from the dispersion in the\npeak position of loss (D) data for relaxation A in Fig. 3b.\nThe high frequency relaxation, A, is thus dominated by\na Debye-type relaxation while the low frequency relaxation, B, arises from the Maxwell-Wagner polarization\nmechanism.\nFig. 4a shows the dielectric constant for an external magnetic field, H = 0 and 2 Tesla, establishing a\nstrong magnetodielectric effect above approximately 100\nK. Absence of any noticeable magnetoresistance effect\n(< 0.3 %), as shown in the inset to Fig. 4a, ensures that\nthe observed magnetodielectricity is an intrinsic property\nof partially-disordered LNMO sample. The percentage\n0\nmagnetodielectricity, M D(%) = \u01eb2T\u01eb\u2212\u01eb\n\u2217 100 is shown\n0\nin Fig. 4b. We find similar high MD values (\u223c16%) for\nfrequencies up to 1 MHz at 300 K. Since the MaxwellWagner contribution to the dielectric constant is progressively suppressed with increasing frequency, it establishes\nthe origin of MD in partially disordered La2 NiMnO6 to\nbe related to the intrinsic Debye part. Interestingly,\nMD behavior of the present partially-disordered sample is qualitatively different from that reported earlier\nfor the ordered sample [11]. MD of the ordered sample vanished abruptly for T < 210 K, while MD of our\npartially-disordered sample remains substantial even at\nmuch lower temperature, e.g. being > 8% at 150 K,\nbecoming negligible only at the temperature where the\nsystem becomes magnetically glassy (< 100 K) indicating an intrinsic connection between spin orientations on\nthe two magnetic sublattices (Ni and Mn) and the magnetodielectric coupling.\n\n\f)\n\n3000\n\nDC Resistance ( k\n\n2000\n\n-8\nH= 0 Tesla\n1000\n\n-10\n\n500\n\n0\n200\n\n225\n\n250\n\n275\n\n300\n\nT (K)\n\n0 Tesla\n1000\n\n(b)\n\n0.4\n\nH= 2 Tesla\n\n2 Tesla\n\n-12\n\n0.3\n\n-14\n\n0.2\n\nMD (%)\n\n4000\n\nM (emu / gm)\n\n'\n\n4\n\n-16\n0.1\n\n(a)\n\n-18\n\n0\n50\n\n0.0\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nT (K)\n\nFigure 4.

The inset shows the absence of any DC magnetoresistance for applied magnetic fields upto 2 Tesla. (b)\nTemperature dependent magnetization (left axis, measured\nwith H = 20 Oe) and magnetodielectricity (right axis).\n\nWe have already noted that the intrinsic part of the\ndielectric constant, exhibiting a Debye relaxation, arises\nfrom an asymmetric hopping between the transition\nmetal sites in presence of the applied electric field. Moreover, this hopping is highly spin dependent, with a parallel spin orientation allowing hopping and an antiparallel orientation between the neighboring sites forbidding the possibility of hopping. We attribute the low\ndielectric constant and an absence of the Debye relaxation for T < 100 K to the random spin arrangement\nof the spin-glass state that suppresses any contribution\nfrom the asymmetric hopping mechanism to the dielectric\nconstant, making the dielectric constant essentially controlled by the electronic and the phonon contributions.\nAt higher temperatures, above the spin-glass transition,\nthe spin-spin correlation is significantly enhanced by the\napplication of the magnetic field, leading to an increasing\nMD up to about the ferromagnetic transition temperature (Fig. 4b). Thereafter the MD again decreases due to\nthermal disordering of the spin orientation even in presence of the magnetic field, thereby giving rise to the observed colossal magnetodielectricity, analogous to colossal magnetoresistance in the manganites. We note that\nunlike other models of MD, which originates from magnetostriction or electrostriction [25], our results show an\nunique way of engineering colossal magnetodielectricity\nthrough relative-spin orientation dependent asymmetric\nhopping of charge carriers between transition metal ion\nsites.\nUsing first-principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory with a generalized gradient approximation as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO package\n[1], we determine structure and vibrational frequencies\nfor the ferromagnetic (FM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) ordering in absence and presence of antisite disorder between Mn and Ni ions in the monoclinic structure of\nLNMO. For configurations with different magnetic ordering and disorder, we have used a 20-atoms unit cell\nof the monoclinic structure. Antisite disorder is introduced by an interchange of Ni and Mn atoms in the ab-\n\nplane. Magnetic moments at all B-cations are in the same\ndirection in the FM configuration, while those at nearest neighbours in the ab-plane are anti-parallel in the\nFiM configuration. This is the smallest supercell that\nallows us to determine effects of disorder and magnetic\nordering on vibrational properties of LNMO in the monoclinic structure. We did not consider any corrections\nfor on-site correlations or non-colinearity of spins, as our\nearlier works [26, 27] were quite successful in capturing\nthe physics, particularly magnetic ordering and insulating properties, of LNMO in rhombohedral structure. We\nfind (a) the difference in energies of FM and FiM ordering\nreduces from 0.10 to 0.05 eV/unit with antisite disorder\nand (b) energy of the FM configuration with disorder is\n0.08 (0.02) eV/unit higher (lower) than the FM (FiM)\nstate of the ordered phase. Thus, the energy-scales of\nmagnetic and chemical ordering are similar, which result in structural and magnetic frustration, and hence\nthe observed bi-glassy behavior. Spin-phonon coupling\n[26] alone cannot explain the significant magnetodielectric effect, which is observed in the temperature range\nwhere phonon contribution to dielectric response is rather\nsmall. Interestingly the dielectric constant calculated\nfrom the phonon and electronic contributions is \u223c 46,\nin good agreement with the dielectric constant (\u223c 50) of\nLa2 NiMnO6 at low temperatures, where the Debye contribution becomes negligible, as already discussed. This\nprovides a strong justification and the relevance of the\npresent theoretical approach. Based on the details of\nthe electronic structure, we believe that the sharp increase in dielectric constant above T =100 K is associated\nwith the onset of a mechanism that involves previously\nmentioned asymmetric hopping in presence of the electric field amounting to a small charge transferred state\n(Ni(2+\u03b4)+ ,Mn(4\u2212\u03b4)+ ) starting from (Ni2+ ,Mn4+ ) state via\nbridging oxygen [23, 28]. Since the displacement of tiny\ncharge, is through the whole unit cell, it gives rise to a\nlarge dipole moment. We may consider perfectly ordered\nLNMO at a low temperature and with fully developed\nmagnetic moment as a system with a clean gap. However,\nany antisite disorder will introduce mid-gap states, associated with the local deviation from the global ferromagnetic order, depending on the specific local arrangements\nof Ni and Mn including antisite defects. This evidently\nreduces the effective energy barrier (estimated to be 120\nmeV from experiments here), thereby making hopping\nmore facile and increasing the dielectric constant. We\nshould note here that the dielectric constant of the presented partially disordered sample is nearly an order of\nmagnitude higher than the reported value of the fully ordered sample [11]. Application of an external magnetic\nfield, however, favors the ferromagnetic arrangement of\nthe magnetic ions, thereby reducing the number of midgap states associated with local magnetic disorder, depending on the strength of the applied field. This on an\naverage increases the energy barrier for the hopping re-\n\n\f5\nsponsible for the large dielectric constant, giving rise to\nthe colossal negative magneto-dielectric effect observed\nhere.\nIn conclusion, partially-disordered La2 NiMnO6 exhibits a re-entrant spin-glass like magnetism, illustrated\nby a frustrated ferromagnetic phase established near 270\nK. The system also exhibits glassy dielectric properties,\nestablishing this system as an unique intrinsic multiglass\nsystem with a very large magnetodielectric coupling over\na wide range of temperature including the room temperature (MD > 16% at 300 K). We discuss the controlling\ninfluence of the partial-disorder in giving rise to these\nproperties in conjunction with ab-initio calculations.\nAuthors thank Department of Science and Technology,\nIndia, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education and the Swedish\nResearch Council (VR) and the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Foundation, Sweden for funding.\n* Also at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India.
