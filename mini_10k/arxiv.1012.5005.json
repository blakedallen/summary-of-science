Introduction\nThe possibility that the bulk of cosmic rays (CRs) observed at Earth may\nbe generated in supernova remnants (SNRs) dates back to the '30s1 and\nwith time it has acquired the rank of a paradigm, mainly because of the\nfact that on energetic grounds2 supernovae are the only class of sources\nin the Galaxy that can provide enough energy as to explain the CR flux\nobserved at Earth. The basic requirements for the SNR paradigm are: 1)\nthat SNRs may accelerate with typical efficiency of \u223c 10 \u2212 20%; 2) that the\nspectrum of individual elements and the consequent all-particle spectrum\nare reproduced, including the presence of a knee at \u223c 3\u00d71015 eV; 3) that the\nchemical abundances of nuclei are well described; 4) that the multifrequency\nobservations of individual remnants, from the radio to the gamma ray band,\nare well described; 4) that the anisotropy induced by the spatial distribution\nof SNRs in the Galaxy is compatible with observations.\nThe acceleration mechanism that is usually assumed to work in SNRs\nis diffusive shock acceleration (DSA),3,4 but the energetic requirement that\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n2\n\nat least \u223c 10 \u2212 20% of the kinetic energy of the supernova shell is converted\nto CRs leads to realize immediately that the standard test-particle version\nof the theory describing this process is not applicable to the description\nof CR acceleration: the reaction of accelerated particles onto the accelerator cannot be neglected and in fact it is responsible for spectral features\n(such as spectral concavity) that may represent potential signatures of CR\nacceleration. There is another, possibly more important reason why DSA\nmust include the reaction of accelerated particles: the standard diffusion\ncoefficient typical of the interstellar medium (ISM) only leads to maximum\nenergies of CRs in the range of \u223c GeV, rather than \u223c 106 GeV (around\nthe knee) required by observations. The only way that the mechanism can\nplay a role for CR acceleration is if the accelerated particles generate the\nmagnetic field structure on which they may scatter,5 thereby reducing the\nacceleration time and reach larger values of the maximum energy. A non linear version of DSA including the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles\non the shock was developed by many authors (see Ref. 6 for a review) and\nmore recently completed with the inclusion of self-generation of magnetic\nfield7\u20139 and acceleration of nuclei other than Hydrogen.10\nFrom the observational point of view the detection of narrow rims in\nthe X-ray emission of several SNRs (Ref. 11 and references therein) has\nprovided an important support to the idea that CRs may amplify the magnetic field close to the shock surface, thereby leading to reach higher energies: these rims are in fact most easily interpreted as the result of the\nsynchrotron emission on a time scale comparable with the loss length of\nthe highest energy electrons.12 A simple estimate leads to magnetic fields\nof order \u223c 100 \u2212 1000\u03bcG downstream of the shock, which are hard to interpret as the result of solely the compression of the field at the shock surface\nsince the ISM magnetic field is typically \u223c 1 \u2212 10\u03bcG and the compression at a strong shock is a factor \u223c 4. It is important to realize that the\nCR induced magnetic field amplification occurs upstream of the shock; the\nperpendicular components of the field are further compressed at the shock\nsurface. Moreover the overall structure of the rims, at least in the case\nof SN1006 appears to be inconsistent with the absence of magnetic field\namplification upstream of the shock.13 However alternative explanations,\ninvolving acceleration at perpendicular shocks and magnetic field amplification due to turbulent eddies downstream of the shock14 may still beb\nplausible explanations of the data.\nThe rigidity dependent nature of DSA leads to predict higher energies\nfor accelerated nuclei (if they get fully ionized), so that the knee may result\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n3\n\nfrom the superposition of the spectra of accelerated nuclei, if the magnetic\nfield is amplified to sufficiently high levels. Unfortunately the problem of\ninjection, hard enough for protons and electrons, becomes even harder for\nnuclei especially for those that may result from sputtering of dust grains.15\nSome phenomenological attempts to calculating the contribution of nuclei\nin the context of non linear theory of DSA to the all-particle spectrum\nobserved at Earth have recently been carried out.10,16,17\nA crucial step towards confirming or rejecting the SNR paradigm might\nbe made through gamma ray observations both in the TeV energy range,\nby using Cherenkov telescopes, and in the GeV energy range accessible to\nthe Fermi gamma ray telescope. Gamma radiation can be produced mainly\nas a result of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of relativistic electrons on\nthe photon background and in inelastic proton-proton scatterings with production and decay of neutral pions. The present observational situation is\nrather puzzling and deserves some special discussion (see \u00a74.1): most gamma\nray spectra observed by Fermi (see18,19 for reviews) (with some important\nexceptions, e.g. RX J1713-3946) hint to rather steep spectra of accelerated\nparticles (\u221d E \u2212\u03b3 , with \u03b3 \u223c 2.4 \u2212 3), which are not easy to accomodate\nin the context of NLDSA that predicts flat spectra, possibly even flatter\nthan E \u22122 at high enough energy.20 Flat injection spectra would also lead to\nrequire a steep dependence of the Galactic diffusion coefficient on energy,\nwhich in turn is known to result in exceedingly large anisotropy.21 The most\nlikely explanation for this discrepancy might lie in a rather subtle detail of\nthe DSA theory, namely that the velocity relevant for particle acceleration\nis the velocity of waves with respect to the plasma. Usually the wave speed\nis negligible compared with the plasma velocity in the shock frame, but in\nthe presence of magnetic field amplification this condition might be weakly\nviolated. This is very bad news in that the spectral changes induced by this\neffect depend not only on the wave speed but on the wave polarization as\nwell. In10,17 the authors show that there are situations in which the spectral steepening can indeed be sufficient to explain the observed spectrum\nof CRs and required by Fermi data on some SNRs.\n\n2. Efficient CR acceleration in SNRs\nWe first summarize the energetic requirements imposed by the SNR\nparadigm together with the diffusive propagation of CRs in the Galaxy.\nIn a simple model in which the sources are all located in an infinitely thin\ndisc with radius Rd and the diffusion coefficient is constant within a halo\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n4\n\nof size H, the density of CRs is easily shown to be\nnCR (E) \u2248\n\nN (E)RSN H\n,\n2\u03c0Rd2 D(E)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RSN is the rate of supernova explosions in the Galaxy, assumed\nto be spatially constant, N (E) \u221d E \u2212\u03b3 is the spectrum of CRs produced\nby an individual SNR (assumed to occur instantaneously) and D(E) is\nthe diffusion coefficient, for which we adopt a typical functional form\nD(E) = 1028 D28 (\u03c1/3GV )\u03b4 cm2 /s, where \u03c1 = E/Z is particle rigidity. In the\nfollowing we concentrate our attention on ultrarelativistic protons, therefore Z = 1 and their speed is the speed of light, c. The flux observed at\nEarth is \u03c6(E) = cnCR (E)/(4\u03c0). In Refs. 22,23 the authors find that in\norder to fit at the same time the B/C ratio and the antiproton data one\nhas to use D28 /Hkpc \u223c 1, therefore one can write the CR flux as\n\u22122\n\u22121 \u22122 \u22121 \u22121\n\u03c6CR (E) \u2248 2.4E51 \u03beCR Rd,15\nRSN,30 (\u03b3 \u22122)3\u03b4 ET\u22122.73\nm s sr , (2)\neV T eV\n\nwhere E51 = ESN /1051 erg, \u03beCR is the CR acceleration efficiency, RSN,30\nis the SN rate in units of one every 30 years and Rd,10 = Rd /15kpc. It\nis easy to see that in order to fit the observed proton spectrum, 8.7 \u00d7\n\u22121 \u22122 \u22121 \u22121\n10\u22122 ET\u22122.73\nm s sr one has to assume an acceleration efficiency\neV T eV\n\u03beCR \u223c 7% for \u03b4 = 1/3, \u03beCR \u223c 11% for \u03b4 = 0.54 and \u03beCR \u223c 58% for \u03b4 = 0.7\nfor the reference values of the parameters. These should be considered as\nlower limits to the required efficiencies. These numbers immediately stress\nthe need for a theory of particle acceleration that takes into account the\npossible dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the accelerator.\n3 another reason was discussed for having a reaction of CRs on the acceleration process: streaming instability induced by the accelerated particles\nleads to magnetic field amplification upstream of the shock (where a spatial\ngradient exists). In the absence of damping and if only resonant streaming\ninstability is excited, the strength of the amplified magnetic field can be\nestimated as a function of the initial field B0 (by using an extrapolation of\nquasi-linear theory) as:8\np\n(3)\n\u03b4B \u223c B0 2MA \u03beCR ,\nwhere MA \u226b 1 is the Alfvenic Mach number. For typical values of\nMA \u223c 1000 one obtains \u03b4B/B0 \u223c 30 and the field is further amplified\nby compression when the fluid element crosses the shock from upstream to\ndownstream. Larger values of the amplification factor can, at least in principle, be reached if non-resonant streaming instabilities are at work.24 It is\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n5\n\nhowever not clear which role the field can play in this case in terms of scattering particles up to the knee energy since the unstable waves are produced\nat wavelengths much shorter than the Larmor radius of the particles generating them. Non linear effects in wave evolution can lead however to transporting energy towards longer wavelengths, though it is not clear whether\nthis process is fast enough to occur within the precursor and thereby lead\nto efficient particle scattering, essence of the acceleration process.\nThese two processes, dynamical reaction of accelerated particles and\nmagnetic field amplification, are the two most important ones to take into\naccount when describing non-linear particle acceleration in SNR shocks.\nThe main predictions of the theory of non-linear DSA are the following: 1)\nspectral concavity induced by the momentum dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient in the upstream precursor; 2) effects related to magnetic field\namplification (X-ray rims downstream, spatial profile of the upstream Xray brightness, maximum energy of accelerated particles, possibly accessible\nthrough the gamma ray range); 3) lower temperatures of the thermal plasma\ndownstream, induced by the simple fact that less energy is left for plasma\nheating after particle acceleration.\n\n3. Observational signatures of efficient CR acceleration\nIn this section we briefly discuss some of the observational evidence pointing\ntowards efficient CR acceleration in individual SNRs. It is worth keeping\nin mind that while the SNR paradigm for the origin of CRs is usually\nquoted without any specific reference to the type of supernovae involved, the\nparticle acceleration process is strongly dependent upon the environment\nin which the supernova goes off. For instance we can expect that the blast\nwave of a SN-type Ia has a larger Mach number than that of a type II SN,\nmainly because of the lower temperature of the ordinary ISM compared\nwith that of the material around a massive star with powerful winds. For\nthe same reason we can expect the gas density to be lower for type-II SNe.\nWhile type-II SNe are more frequent than type Ia, it is probably more\ndifficult to observe a gamma ray emission of hadronic origin from these\nobjects because of the lower gas density. This short warning is meant to\nstress that the constraints obtained on the particle acceleration efficiency\nof a few SNRs are hard to generalize to the whole zoo of SNRs.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n6\n\n3.1. X-ray emission from rims and precursor\nNon-thermal X-ray radiation is produced in SNRs through synchrotron\nemission of high energy electrons in the magnetic field around the shock.\nThe emission is dominated by the region downstream of the shock where\nthe magnetic field is stronger and is cut off at a frequency that, in the case\nof Bohm diffusion, is independent of the strength of the magnetic field:\n\u03bdmax \u2248 0.2 u28 keV,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere u8 = ush /(108 cm/s) is the shock velocity in units of 1000 km/s. The\nmaximum energy of accelerated electrons depends on the strength of the\namplified magnetic field and can be estimated as\nEmax \u2248 10 B100\n\n\u22121/2\n\nu8 TeV,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere B100 = B/100\u03bcG is the magnetic field in units of 100\u03bcG.\nThe emission region has a spatial extent at \u03bd \u223c \u03bdmax which is determined by diffusion and can be written as\np\n\u22123/2\n(6)\n\u2206x \u2248 D(Emax )\u03c4loss (Emax ) \u2248 0.04 B100 pc.\nThe typical thickness of the X-ray rims found through high resolution observations is of order \u223c 10\u22122 pc, thereby leading to predicting values of the\nmagnetic field of 100\u2212300\u03bcG downstream of the shock (or \u223c 20\u221280\u03bcG upstream of the shock, if the field is amplified by the streaming of accelerated\nparticles and further compressed at the shock).\nIn Fig. 1 we show the X-ray brightness profile (histogram) of part of\nthe rim of SN 1006.25 The thick lines refer to the predictions of NLDSA13\nfor three values of the injection efficiency (larger values of \u03be correspond to\nlower efficiencies). The thin lines are the predicted radial profiles in testparticle theory for two values of the upstream magnetic field (as indicated).\nTwo pieces of information arise from this figure: 1) the narrow rims (\u223c\n10 \u2212 20 arcsec) downstream can only be reproduced for efficient particle\nacceleration scenarios; 2) the predicted X-ray emission from the precursor\nregion drops below the background for the same cases in which the rims are\npresent. In other words, the non-detection of the precursor X-ray emission\nmight be additional evidence for efficient acceleration. This is due to the\nfact that the spatial extent of the precursor is reduced when magnetic fields\nare amplified by CR streaming.\nAlthough very interesting, this interpretation is not totally unique:\nit could be that the magnetic field is not amplified upstream by CRs,\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n7\n\nCounts (a.u.)\n\n10\n\n1\n\nB1= 3 \u03bcG\nB1= 10 \u03bcG\n\u03be= 4.15\n\u03be= 3.95\n\u03be= 3.90\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nArcsec\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFig. 1.

Collisionless shocks in partially ionized plasmas\nThe blast waves produced by supernovae explosions give rise to collisionless shocks. The formation of the shock, as well as of the precursor is due\nto plasma processes which affect the ionized component of the plasmas involved. The neutral component, if present, is affected by the presence of\nthe shock and by particle acceleration only through the process of charge\nexchange and, to a lesser extent, through ionization. A neutral atom can exchange an electron with an ion if the two are moving with different speeds.\nThis can happen in three situations: 1) if the temperatures of ions and neutrals are different; 2) if ions and neutrals share the same temperature but\ntwo atoms lie on different parts of the thermal velocity distribution; 3) If\nthe ions and neutrals have different bulk velocities.\nIn the absence of CR induced precursor, the effect of charge exchange\nappears after shock crossing: downstream of the shock the ionized plasma is\ncompressed and shock heated, while the neutral gas keeps moving with the\nupstream speed u0 (neutrals might also have an intrinsic thermal motion,\nbut for the present discussion we can neglect this point). At this point,\ncharge exchange may take place in that cold neutral can lose an electron\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n8\n\nto a hot ion. As a result, a population of colder ions and one of warmer\nneutrals are produced.\nThe observational signature of this phenomenon is clear in the so-called\nBalmer dominated shocks, where the Balmer lines are clearly detected.\nCharge exchange leads to the formation of a narrow line, corresponding\nto the neutrals that keep the same 'temperature' as they had upstream and\ndid not suffer charge exchange, and a broad line corresponding to the neutrals that have been produced through charge exchange and were hot ions\nbefore the process. The measurement of the width of the narrow and broad\nBalmer lines allows one to measure the temperature of the two components.\nThe situation becomes more interesting in the presence of cosmic rays:\nwhen the pressure of accelerated particles upstream of the shock generates\nthe precursor, in the shock frame the bulk motion of ions is slowed down\nwith respect to neutrals. Neutral atoms keep moving with the velocity that\nions have at upstream infinity, u0 , therefore a difference in bulk velocity\nbetween the two species arises. At the shock crossing, the ionized plasma\nsuffers shock heating and compression while the neutral component does\nnot feel the shock and keeps moving with speed u0 . In the presence of\nCR acceleration, the temperature of the ions downstream is clearly lower\nthat in the absence of CRs, simply because of energy conservation (there\nis now another component, CRs, into which the ram pressure \u03c10 u20 can be\nchannelled). Therefore one can expect that the width of the broad Balmer\nline is somewhat smaller than in the absence of CRs. This phenomenon has\nbeen recently observed26 in the SNR RCW86.\nMeasurements of the proper motion of the shock lead to a shock velocity\nof u0 = 6000 \u00b1 2800 km/s, which in turn should imply a downstream\ntemperature of T2 = 20\u2212150 keV or T2 = 12\u221290 keV depending on whether\nprotons and electrons reach or not thermal equilibrium downstream, and\nassuming that no CR acceleration is taking place. The temperature inferred\nfrom the width of the broad Balmer line is T2 = 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 keV. The authors\ninterpreted this discrepancy as the result of effective CR acceleration at\nthe SNR shock, with an estimated efficiency of \u223c 50 \u2212 60% (this numerical\nvalue is however rather model dependent).\nAs pointed out above, in CR modified shocks some level of charge exchange is expected to take place in the precursor because of the difference\nin bulk velocity between the ionized plasma and the neutrals. The process is\nresponsible for producing a population of warmer neutrals upstream. After\nshock crossing this leads to a narrow Balmer line which is broader than in\nthe absence of a CR induced precursor. This effect was observed in several\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n9\n\nSNRs.27 An independent signature of the same phenomenon was recently\nfound in the Tycho SNR:28 the authors used the Hubble Space Telescope to\nmeasure the intensity of the broadened narrow Balmer line as a function of\nposition around the shock and claim that there is substantial emission from\nthe region in front of the shock. This finding could be either the signature\nof different bulk velocities between ions and neutrals (precursor) or of a\ndifferent temperature of the two components. In this latter case, the ions\ncould have been heated up due to the action of turbulent heating in the\nprecursor.\nA quantitative investigation of these phenomena in the presence of realistic cosmic ray modified shock structures is under way (see Ref.29 for\npreliminary results).\nIn the future the importance of the detection of anomalous widths of\nBalmer lines in SNR shocks will plausibly increase especially if a clear\ncorrelation with the detection of narrow non-thermal X-ray rims could be\nestablished. This correlation would represent a crucial confirmation that\nmagnetic field amplification and efficient CR acceleration are related to\neach other.\n3.3. Maximum energy and the knee\nThe spectrum of individual elements in CRs carries more information than\nthe all-particle spectrum in terms of understanding particle acceleration in\nthe sources. The spectrum of protons measured by KASCADE30 shows a\npronounced decline at \u223c f ew \u00d7 106 GeV, which is likely to be produced by\nthe acceleration process running out of steam. Although other experiments\nappear to disagree on the details of the measurement, they also show a\ndecline in the same energy range. The situation for He nuclei is similar\nbut it becomes rapidly worse for heavier nuclei. If the interpretation of this\ndecline in terms of a maximum energy at the sources is correct, this implies\nthat CR protons need be accelerated at least to \u223c f ew \u00d7 106 GeV in SNRs,\nin they are the sources.\nFor Bohm diffusion, this result can be achieved in SNRs only if the\nmagnetic field is amplified by \u223c 100, a number surprisingly close to that\ninferred from the width of X-ray rims. This conclusion was also confirmed\nin the context of NLDSA.31 Since the maximum energy reached through\ndiffusive shock acceleration scales with the charge of the nucleus, another\nconsequence of this line of thought is that at energies above \u223c f ew \u00d7 106\nGeV the chemical composition should become dominated by heavier nuclei\nand that the spectrum of Galactic CRs should eventually end at energies\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n10\n\nof order \u223c 108 GeV with an iron dominated composition. At this point a\ntransition to extragalactic CRs is expected.\n4. Problematic aspects of the SNR paradigm\nCan we consider the SNR paradigm as proven right? As discussed in the\nprevious section there are plenty of evidences that at least some of the\nSNRs we observe are accelerating CRs efficiently. What does not allow us\nto claim a full confirmation is the existence of several loose ends as well as\nthe fact that other SNRs do not seem to be accelerating (hadronic) CRs to\nthe level required by the paradigm. It is however worth stressing here again\na crucial point. The simplicity of the SNR paradigm contrasts with the\ncomplexity of Nature in many different ways and while the general theory\nmakes some very general predictions on a \"typical\" SNR, the behaviour of\nan individual SNR depends on many physical phenomena which are specific\nof the environment where the supernova explodes and are much harder to\npredict. Below we list some of the aspects that represent possible challenges\nfor the SNR paradigm.\n4.1. Gamma ray observations\nOne of the observational signatures of SNRs as sources of CRs that has been\nlong waited for is the detection of gamma radiation from the production and\ndecay of neutral pions. Aside from the experimental difficulties in detecting\nthe gamma rays from SNRs, it may be even more problematic to establish\nwhether a detected flux can be unambiguously attributed to \u03c0 0 decay or\nrather to ICS of accelerated electrons. In the last few years the gamma ray\ndetections of SNRs have proliferated both with Cherenkov telescopes32\u201334\nand with the Fermi-LAT telescope.35\nThe first case that was strongly suggestive of a hadronic origin of CRs\nwas SNR RX J1713-3946, detected by HESS in the TeV energy region and\nlater by Fermi18 at lower energies. The combined spectrum appears to be\nrelatively flat and probably of hadronic origin (see \u00a74.2 for more discussion\non this point). Rather unexpectedly most of the SNRs detected by Fermi\nhave a rather steep gamma ray spectrum, with slope \u223c 2.4 \u2212 3, quite unlike\nthe flat or even concave spectra predicted in the context of NLDSA. One\nmight argue that the steep spectra are mostly observed in old SNRs with\na nearby molecular cloud that serves as a target for inelastic CR collisions.\nThis possibility is certainly to be kept in mind.\nWhether such steep spectra may be compatible with having efficient\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n11\n\nCR acceleration and magnetic field amplification still remains to be investigated, but it is interesting to notice that, as we discuss in \u00a74.3, the observed\nspectrum of CRs at Earth also leads to a preference of relatively steep injection spectrum. Flat injection implies in fact a too large CR anisotropy.21\n4.2. X-ray lines\nAs mentioned above, gamma rays were detected from SNR RX J17133946. In Ref. 36 a detailed analysis of the arguments in favor and against\na hadronic origin of this radiation was carried out. The authors conclude that a hadronic origin is favored but that there are some problems\nwith it, the most important of which is that the predicted thermal X-ray\nbremsstrahlung emission exceeds observations unless the temperature of\nelectrons is much smaller than that of protons. Indeed it can be expected\nthat electrons are thermalized to a temperature \u223c me /mp lower than for\nprotons and that they gradually thermalize with protons on time scales as\nlarge as the time scale for Coulomb scattering, although other collisionless\nprocesses may lead to faster thermalization. In Ref. 37 it was argued that\nCoulomb scattering is sufficient to heat up the electrons to a temperature\nof \u223c 1 keV during the expansion of the remnant, enough to excite emission\nlines whose intensity should have been detected. From the non-detection\nthe authors conclude that the observed gamma rays cannot be of hadronic\norigin.\n4.3. Spectra at Earth\nIn the simple case of a power law injection spectrum of CRs \u221d E \u2212\u03b3 , the\nspectrum observed at Earth is n(E) \u223c E \u2212\u03b3\u2212\u03b4 , where the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be D(E) \u221d E \u03b4 . This simple argument implies that the\nflatter the injection spectrum the larger must be the value of \u03b4. However\n\u03b4 > 0.5 \u2212 0.6 leads to excessive anisotropy of the CRs observed at Earth,\nthereby imposing a preference for relatively steep injection spectra. For\ninstance for a Kolmogorov diffusion coefficient D(E) \u221d E 1/3 the required\ninjection spectrum must be \u223c E \u22122.4 . As discussed above, such steep spectra\nare not easy to obtain in NLDSA with efficient acceleration and magnetic\nfield amplification. The only possibility, recently suggested in Refs. 10,17\nis that the magnetic field amplification also leads to introduce a relatively\nlarge velocity of the scattering centers responsible for particle diffusion in\nthe shock region. This phenomenon leads to steeper spectra even in the\ncontext of NLDSA. The net effect is however to have lower magnetic fields\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n15:49\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9in x 6in\n\nblasi\n\n12\n\nand lower efficiencies of particle acceleration.10 In Ref. 10 the authors calculate the spectra of different nuclei at the source and after propagation:\nthe injected spectra are steeper than in standard NLDSA, but they still\nrequire D(E) \u221d E 0.54 , in agreement with previous calculations17 and sort\nof borderline from the point of view of anisotropy.\nIt is important to keep in mind that calculations of the spectra of CRs\nreleased by SNRs into the ISM are highly uncertain because of the lack of\na proper understanding of the processes responsible for the escape of CRs\nfrom the sources.20,38,39\n5. Conclusions\nWe provided a short review of the main arguments in favor and against the\nso called SNR paradigm for the origin of Galactic CRs. There is a train of\nrecent evidence that efficient CR acceleration takes place in several SNRs.\nProbably the most striking findings are the detection of narrow X-ray rims\ninterpreted as evidence for magnetic field amplification, and numerous observational results on Balmer dominated shocks, which also lead to conclude\nthat CRs are being accelerated effectively.\nOn the other hand, there are a few pieces of the puzzle that do not appear to be in place: the non-detection of X-ray lines from SNR RX J17133946 is certainly problematic for a scenario in which the detected gamma\nrays are of hadronic origin. Fermi-LAT gamma ray observations of several\nSNRs with steep spectra also seems to be at odds with the standard predictions of NLDSA which is expected to describe efficient CR acceleration\nin SNR shocks. Steep spectra are also suggested by observations of CR\nanisotropy. We have discussed how the last two issues mentioned above\ncould be understood by taking into account the finite velocity of the waves\nscattering particles close to the shock.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author is grateful to his collaborators, E.
