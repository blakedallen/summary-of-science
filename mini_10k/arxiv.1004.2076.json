Three well-known generalized-ensemble algorithms are the multicanonical algorithm (MUCA) [2, 3] (the\nMD version was developed in refs. 4 and 5), replica-exchange method (REM) [6] (the method is also referred to as\nparallel tempering [7] and the MD version, which is referred to as REMD, was developed in ref. 8), and simulated\ntempering (ST) [9, 10]. These methods can be used for obtaining accurate physical quantities in the canonical\nensemble. Among them, REM (particularly REMD) is often used because the weight factor is a priori known (i.e.,\nthe Boltzmann factor), while those for MUCA and ST have to be determined before the simulations.\nMultidimensional (or multivariable) extensions of the original generalized-ensemble algorithms have been developed\nin many ways (see the references in ref. 1) and recently the general formulations have been given in refs. 11-13.\nIn this letter, we present a multidimensional simulated tempering algorithm in the isobaric-isothermal (N P T )\nensemble. Several generalized-ensemble algorithms for the N P T ensemble have been proposed (for example, the\nmultibaric-multithermal (MUBATH) algorithm [14\u201317] and REM in temperature and pressure [18\u201321]) and here, we\npresent an ST algorithm for the N P T ensemble to complete generalized-ensemble algorithms for this ensemble.\nWe first briefly review the generalized-ensemble algorithms for isobaric-isothermal molecular simulations. Let us\nconsider a physical system that consists of N atoms and that is in a box of a finite volume V . The states of the\nsystem are specified by coordinates r \u2261 {r1 , r2 , * * * , rN } and momenta p \u2261 {p1 , p2 , * * * , pN } of the atoms and volume\nV of the box. The potential energy E(r, V ) for the system is a function of r and V .\nWe first describe MC simulation algorithms for MUCA, REM, and ST in the N P T ensemble. In these cases,\nmomenta of atoms do not have to be considered. To make a system an equilibrium state, the detailed balance\ncondition is imposed and a transition probability w(X \u2192 X \u2032 ) from an old state X to a new state X \u2032 can be given by\nthe Metropolis criterion. [22]\nIn MUBATH simulations, we introduce a function H(E, V ) and use a weight factor Wmbt (E, V ) \u2261 exp [\u2212\u03b20 H(E, V )]\nso that the distribution function fmbt (E, V ) of E and V may be uniform:\nfmbt (E, V ) \u221d n(E, V )Wmbt (E, V ) = constant,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b20 is an arbitrary inverse reference temperature defined as \u03b20 = 1/kB T0 (kB is the Boltzmann constant) and\nn(E, V ) is the density of states.\nTo perform MUBATH MC simulations, the trial moves are generated in the same way as in the usual constant\nN P T MC simulations [23] and the transition probability from X \u2261 {s, V } to X \u2032 \u2261 {s\u2032 , V \u2032 } is given by [14, 15]\nwmbt (X \u2192 X \u2032 ) = min [1, exp(\u2212\u2206mbt )] ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2206mbt = \u03b20 {H [E(s\u2032 , V \u2032 ), V \u2032 ] \u2212 H [E(s, V ), V ] \u2212 N kB T0 ln(V \u2032 /V )} ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\nand s = {s1 , s2 , * * * , sN } is the scaled coordinates defined by si = V \u22121/3 ri (i = 1, 2, * * * , N ). Here, we are assuming\nthe box is a cube of side V \u22121/3 .\nIn REM simulations, we prepare a system that consists of MT \u00d7 MP non-interacting replicas of the original system,\nwhere MT and MP are the number of temperature and pressure values used in the simulation, respectively. The\n\n\f2\nreplicas are specified by labels i (i = 1, 2, * * * , MT \u00d7 MP ), temperature by mt (mt = 1, 2, * * * , MT ), and pressure by\nmp (mp = 1, 2, * * * , MP ).\nTo perform REM MC (REMC) simulations, we carry out the following two steps alternately: (1) perform a\nusual constant N P T simulation in each replica at assigned temperature and pressure and (2) try to exchange the\nreplicas. If the temperature (specified by mt and nt ) and pressure (specified by mp and np ) between the replicas are exchanged, the transition probability from X \u2261 {* * * , (s[i] , V [i] ; Tmt , Pmp ), * * * , (s[j] , V [j] ; Tnt , Pnp ), * * * } to\nX \u2032 \u2261 {* * * , (s[i] , V [i] ; Tnt , Pnp ), * * * , (s[j] , V [j] ; Tmt , Pmp ), * * * } at the trial is given by [19, 20]\nwrem (X \u2192 X \u2032 ) = min [1, exp(\u2212\u2206rem )] ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nh\ni\n\u2206rem = (\u03b2mt \u2212 \u03b2nt ) E(s[j] , V [j] ) \u2212 E(s[i] , V [i] ) + (\u03b2mt Pmp \u2212 \u03b2nt Pnp ) V [j] \u2212 V [i] .\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\nIn ST simulations, we introduce a function g(T, P ) and use a weight factor Wst (E, V ; T, P ) \u2261 exp[\u2212\u03b2(E + P V ) +\ng(T, P )] so that the distribution function fst (T, P ) of T and P may be uniform:\nZ \u221e\nZ\nfst (T, P ) \u221d\ndr Wst [E(r, V ), V ; T, P ] = constant.\n(6)\ndV\nV\n\n0\n\nFrom eq.

The transition probability from X \u2261 {s, V ; T, P } to\nX \u2032 \u2261 {s, V ; T \u2032 , P \u2032 } for this trial is given by\nwst (X \u2192 X \u2032 ) = min [1, exp(\u2212\u2206st )] ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u2206st = (\u03b2 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b2)E(s, V ) + (\u03b2 \u2032 P \u2032 \u2212 \u03b2P )V \u2212 [g(T \u2032 , P \u2032 ) \u2212 g(T, P )] .\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n\nFor MD simulations with MUCA, REM, and ST in the N P T ensemble, the actual formulations depend on constant\ntemperature and pressure algorithms. Here, we employ the MD methods with the Martyna-Tobias-Klein (MTK)\nalgorithm, [24] whose equations of motion follow Nos\u00e9 [25, 26] and Hoover [27] for the thermostat and Andersen [28]\nfor the barostat.\nTo perform MUBATH MD simulations, we solve the usual equations of motion for the MTK algorithm except that\nit is necessary to modify the equations for pi and p\u03b5 as follows:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 p\u03b5\n\u2202H \u2202E\np\u03be\ndpi\n\u2212 1+\n=\u2212\npi \u2212 pi ,\n(10a)\ndt\n\u2202E \u2202ri\nN W\nQ\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\ndp\u03b5\n1 X p2i\np\u03be\n\u2202H\n+\n\u2212 p\u03b5 ,\n= 3V Pint \u2212\n(10b)\ndt\n\u2202V\nN i=1 mi\nQ\nwhere\nPint\n\n1\n=\n3V\n\n\"N\nX p2\n\u2202H\ni\n\u2212\nm\n\u2202E\ni\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202E\nri *\n+ 3V\n\u2202r\n\u2202V\ni\ni=1\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\np\u03b5 is the momentum associated with the logarithm of V , p\u03be is the momentum of the thermostat, and W and Q are\nthe masses of barostat and thermostat, respectively.\nWhen we perform MD simulations with REM and ST, the momenta should be rescaled if the replicas are exchanged\nfor the temperature in REM [8] and the temperature is updated in ST [12].\nIn REM MD (REMD) simulations with the MTK algorithm, let an old state be X\n\u2261\n[j]\n[j] [j] [j] [j]\n[i]\n[i] [i] [i] [i]\n\u2261\n{* * * , (r , V , p , p\u03b5 , p\u03be ; Tmt , Pmp ), * * * , (r , V , p , p\u03b5 , p\u03be ; Tnt , Pnp ), * * * } and a new state X\n\n\f3\n[i]\u2032\n\n[j]\u2032\n\n[j]\u2032\n\n[i]\u2032\n\n{* * * , (r[i] , V [i] , p[i]\u2032 , p\u03b5 , p\u03be ; Tnt , Pnp ), * * * , (r[j] , V [j] , p[j]\u2032 , p\u03b5 , p\u03be ; Tmt , Pmp ), * * * }.\nperformed, the momenta should be rescaled as follows: [29]\ns\ns\nTnt [i]\nTmt [j]\n[j]\u2032\n[i]\u2032\np , p =\np\np =\nT mt\nTnt\ns\ns\nW\nT\nTmt Wm [j]\nnt n [i]\np\u03b5 , p[j]\u2032\np\np[i]\u2032\n\u03b5 =\n\u03b5 =\nTmt Wm\nTnt Wn \u03b5\ns\ns\nTnt Qn [i]\nTmt Qm [j]\n[i]\u2032\n[j]\u2032\np\u03be =\np , p\u03be =\np ,\nT mt Q m \u03be\nTnt Qn \u03be\n\nWhen replica exchange is\n\n(12a)\n(12b)\n(12c)\n\nwhere Wm and Qm are the masses in the simulation at Tmt and Pmp , and Wn and Qn are the ones at Tnt and Pnp .\nThen the transition probability (4) and (5) can also be used in the REMD simulations.\nIn ST MD simulations with the MTK algorithm, let an old state be X \u2261 {r, V, p, p\u03b5 , p\u03be ; T, P } and a new state\nX \u2032 \u2261 {r, V, p\u2032 , p\u2032\u03b5 , p\u2032\u03be ; T \u2032 , P \u2032 }.

(8) and (9).\nWhile the weight factors in REM simulations are a priori known, those in MUBATH and ST simulations have to\nbe determined before the simulations. We propose two-dimensional extensions of the replica-exchange multicanonical\nalgorithm (REMUCA) [30] and the replica-exchange simulated tempering (REST) [31] for the isobaric-isothermal\nensemble to overcome the difficulty of determining the weight factors. First, we perform a REM simulation for the\nisobaric-isothermal ensemble and then calculate the density of states and the dimensionless Gibbs free energy by the\nmultiple-histogram reweighting techniques, [32] or the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), [33] using the\nresults of the REM simulation. The WHAM equations for isobaric-isothermal simulations are given by\n\nn(E, V ) =\n\nMP\nMT X\nX\n\n(1 + 2\u03c4ij )\u22121 Nij (E, V )\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nMT X\nMP\nX\n\n,\n\u22121\n\nnij (1 + 2\u03c4ij )\n\n(14a)\n\nexp [gij \u2212 \u03b2i (E + Pj V )]\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nexp (\u2212gij ) =\n\nXX\nE\n\nn(E, V ) exp [\u2212\u03b2i (E + Pj V )] ,\n\n(14b)\n\nV\n\nwhere gij \u2261 g(Ti , Pj ), Nij (E, V ) is the histogram of E and V , nij is the number of the data, and \u03c4ij is the integrated\nautocorrelation time in the simulation at Ti and Pj , respectively. These equations need to be solved self-consistently.\nWe remark that for biomolecular systems, it was found that \u03c4ij may be set to a constant value for all i and j in eq.\n(14a). [33]\nIn the isobaric-isothermal version of REST, the weight factor can also be determined using the dimensionless Gibbs\nfree energy obtained from eqs. (14a) and (14b).\nIn order to verify that the generalized-ensemble algorithms discussed above can be effective for conformational\nsampling and give the same results, we performed MD simulations with the three generalized-ensemble algorithms.\nWe used a system of an alanine dipeptide in 73 surrounding water molecules and the system was placed in a cubic\ncell with periodic boundary conditions. Both of the backbone dihedral angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 of the peptide were initially\nset to 180\u25e6 . The simulations were performed with the tinker program package. [34] Several of the programs were\nmodified and a few programs were added so that MUBATH, REM, and ST simulations with the MTK algorithm can\nbe performed. We used the AMBER parm99 force field [35] for the peptide and the TIP3P water model. [36] The\nelectrostatic interactions were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. [37, 38] In the van der Waals interaction\ncalculations, we used the spherical cutoff method and the cutoff distance was set to 12.0 \u00c5. The integration of the\nequations of motion was employed by the method proposed by Martyna et al. [39] and the Shake/Rattle/Roll constraint\nmethod [39\u201341] was used so that the water molecules are rigid body molecules. The unit time step was set to 0.5 fs.\nThe mass parameters W and Q were determined as in ref. 39.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Results of the two-dimensional REMD simulation: (a) the time series of T and P in one of the replicas and (b) the\ntime series of the replica label at 280 K and 250 MPa.\n\nFirst, we performed the two-dimensional REMD simulation. The simulation time was set to 2.0 ns. We used\nthe following 6 temperature (T1 , * * * , T6 ) and 4 pressure (P1 , * * * , P4 ) values: 280, 305, 332, 362, 395, and 430 K for\ntemperature and 0.1, 65, 150, and 250 MPa for pressure. At the replica-exchange trial, either exchanging temperature\n(T -exchange) or exchanging pressure (P -exchange) was chosen randomly and then the pairs {(T1 , T2 ), (T3 , T4 ), (T5 , T6 )}\nor {(T2 , T3 ), (T4 , T5 )} for T -exchange and {(P1 , P2 ), (P3 , P4 )} or {(P2 , P3 )} for P -exchange were also chosen randomly.\nFigure 1(a) shows the time series of T and P in one of the replicas and Fig. 1(b) shows the time series of the label\nof the replicas in the simulation at 280 K and 250 MPa. From these figures, it is found that random walks in T -P\nspace were realized in each of the replicas. The acceptance ratios in the REM simulation were in the range from\n0.152 to 0.205 for T -exchange and from 0.296 to 0.446 for P -exchange, respectively, which also implies that sufficient\nnumber of replica exchange was realized.\nWe then performed 24 MUBATH simulations of 2.0 ns, where the total simulation time was 48 ns so that it is equal\nto that in the REMD simulation. In each of the simulations, different initial velocities were given. The data were\nsampled every 100 fs. The reference temperature was set to 430 K. \u2202H/\u2202E and \u2202H/\u2202V were interpolated by the\nthird-order polynomial, following ref. 17.\nFigure 2 shows the probability distributions of E and V from the MUBATH simulations. From Fig. 2(a), it is found\nthat the MUBATH simulations gave a uniform distribution in the range where the density of states was obtained\naccurately in the REMD simulation and that the distribution of the MUBATH simulations was much wider than the\nones for the N P T ensemble (see Fig. 2(b)).\nTwenty-four ST simulations of 2.0 ns were carried out, which gave us the same number of sampled data as in\nthe REMD and MUBATH simulations. In each simulation, different initial velocities were given. We used the same\ntemperature and pressure values as in the REMD simulation. We tried to update the parameter (T or P ) every 100\nfs and the data were sampled just before the trials. The choice between updating T (T -update) and updating P\n(P -update) was made randomly and then either Tmt \u22121 or Tmt +1 for T -update and Pmp \u22121 or Pmp +1 for P -update\nwas also chosen randomly, where mt and mp stand for the labels corresponding to the temperature and the pressure\nbefore the trial, respectively.\n\nFIG. 2: Logarithm of probability distributions f of E and V (a) in the MUBATH simulations and (b) for the N P T ensemble\nat 280 K and 250 MPa (left) and at 430 K and 0.1 MPa (right). The distributions corresponding to the N P T ensemble were\ncalculated by the single-histogram reweighting techniques [42] using the results of the MUBATH simulations.\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 3: Results of the ST simulations: (a) the time series of T and P for 2.0 ns and (b) the logarithm of the probability\ndistribution f of T and P .\n\nFigure 3(a) shows the time series of T and P and Fig. 3(b) shows the probability distribution of T and P . These\nfigures indicate that random walks in T -P space were successfully realized. The acceptance ratios in the ST simulations\nwere in the range from 0.260 to 0.430 for T -update and from 0.426 to 0.642 for P -update, respectively.\nFigure 4 shows the probability distributions of the backbone dihedral angles at 298 K and 0.1 MPa in all the\nsimulations. Compared with the simulations with REMD, MUBATH, and ST, we also performed 24 conventional\nisobaric-isothermal simulations of 2.0 ns at 298 K and 0.1 MPa with different initial velocities. The dihedral angle\ndistributions in the simulations with the generalized-ensemble algorithms had a small peak in 0\u25e6 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 90\u25e6 and\n\u221290\u25e6 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 90\u25e6 , although there was no peak in the range in the distribution of the conventional simulations. All the\nsimulations with the three generalized-ensemble algorithms were able to provide the same results and reproduce the\ndistribution obtained previously in refs. 43 and 44.\nIn this letter, we presented the extensions of MUCA, REM, and ST for isobaric-isothermal molecular simulations.\nThese algorithms can be effective methods for conformational sampling and give accurate physical quantities in the\nisobaric-isothermal ensemble. Therefore, one can use the generalized-ensemble algorithms to study temperature and\npressure effects on complex systems such as biomolecular systems.\nWe expect the simulated tempering to be a more useful method for simulations in large systems. Many replicas are\nneeded in REM simulations of large systems, while only one replica is used in ST simulations. In addition, ST can be\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Contour maps of probability distribution of the backbone dihedral angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 in the simulations\nwith (a) REMD, (b) MUBATH, and (c) ST and (d) in the conventional isobaric-isothermal simulations. In these figures, the\nprobability distributions at 298 K and 0.1 MPa are plotted in logarithmic scale and were calculated by the single-histogram\nreweighting techniques for MUBATH and by WHAM for REMD and ST.\n\n\f6\neasily implemented into existing program packages compared to MUCA (or MUBATH), in which a force calculation\npart of programs has to be modified for MD simulations. Therefore, molecular simulations with ST will be more\neasily applicable to larger systems than with the other two generalized-ensemble algorithms.\nAcknowledgments\n\nSome of the computations were performed on the supercomputers at the Information Technology Center, Nagoya\nUniversity and at the Research Center for Computational Science, Institute for Molecular Science.
