Our construction is based on an idea of\nWitten.\nIn the special case that each connected component of the Lagrangian submanifold has the rational homology of a sphere we define rational numbers\nFg,h for each genus g and h boundary components.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet M be a Calabi-Yau three-fold and let L be a special Lagrangian submanifold\nof M . The open Gromov-Witten invariants of the pair (M, L) are supposed to count\nthe pseudo-holomorphic bordered curves of M with boundary mapped into L, or\nequivalently the Euler characteristic of the moduli space of pseudo-holomorphic\nbordered curves. Mathematicians have been unable to give a general construction of\nthese invariants basically because the moduli space of pseudo holomorphic bordered\ncurves has codimension one boundary, making its Euler characteristic ill defined.\nHowever a definition was given assuming particular symmetries of the pair (M, L)\n(see [5], [6]).\nOn the other hand, Witten in [7] defines (at the physical level of rigor) the open\ntopological string partition function for a pair (X, L). It is well known that the\nclosed topological string partition function can be computed in terms of closed\nGromov-Witten invariants. By analogy, the result of [7] predicts the existence of\nOpen Gromov-Witten invariants. These invariants have also been computed in\nstring theory in many examples.\nIn this paper we give a mathematical construction of the invariant of [7] and\ntherefore we provide a mathematical definition of Open Gromov-Witten invariants.\nThere are two phenomena that make the boundary of the moduli space of pseudo\nholomorphic disks of codimension one: the bubbling off of disks and the bubbling\noff of spheres from a constant disks.\nThe bubbling off of spheres from constant disks is less harmful since it can\nhappen only in a discrete set points of the space of parameters that we need to\ndefine the moduli space of disks (such as the space of compatible almost complex\nstructures). To deal with this problem we assume that L is homologically trivial\n(we do not assume that L is connected). This will allow us to add correction terms\nthat compensate the bubbling off of spheres from constant disks. This condition\nis also natural in string theory since it implies that the topological charge of the\nD-brane is zero. It was also used in mathematics independently by Joyce.\nDate: version: November 12, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVITO IACOVINO\n\nThe problem of the splitting of the curves is a much more delicate issue since\nit happens along the entire space of parameters, making meaningless the count of\nthe number of curves. In fact, the number of open curves strongly depends on the\nperturbation of the pseudo-holomorphic equation.\nThe key to solve this problem is suggested by the result of [7]. Witten argues\nthat the open topological string partition function receives contributions also from\ndegenerate or partialy degenerate curves. These objects are made by usual curves\njoined by infinite thin strips living on L. Witten proposes that this contribution\ncan be computed in terms of Chern-Simons integrals. For example, in the case\nof the cotangent bundle M = T \u2217 L, where there are no non-constant holomorphic\ncurves with boundary mapped into the zero section, the open topological string\nis equivalent to Chern-Simons theory on L. The degenerate curves correspond\nto Feynman graphs of the Chern-Simons theory. For more general Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds, where pseudo-holomorphic curves can be present, Witten computes the\ncontribution of degenerate curves using Wilson loop integrals associated to the\nboundary of the curves (see formula (4.50) of [7])).\nFrom the work of Witten it follows that open topological string theory does\nnot simply count open curves, but it counts what we define as multi-curves, in\nanalogy with the physical terminology multi-instantons. Roughly, a multi-disk is\ndescribed by a tree of disks. The moduli space of multi-curves provides the natural\nmathematical setting for the Feynman expansion of the Lagrangian (4.50) of [7]\nand therefore for the general solution of the problem of splitting of curves. We give\na mathematical regularization of the Feynman expansion of the Lagrangian (4.50)\nof [7].\nThe usual virtual computation applied to the space of multi-curves leads to a\nnew algebraic topological object. We call this object system of singular chains.\nThis object encodes all the informations for the curves counting.\nIn the particular case that L has the rational homology of a sphere, we apply\nthis general formalism to show that it naturally leads to Open Gromov-Witten\ninvariants. The contribution of multi-disks to the Open Gromov-Witten invariant\nis computed as generalization of linking numbers of the boundary components of the\ndisk vertices. Let us explain in this particular case how the problem of the bubbling\noff of disks is solved. Consider for example a one parameter family of compatible\nalmost complex structures of M . Suppose that a disk A splits into two disks B\nand C. The contribution of the 2-disk B, C is given by the linking number of the\nboundary knots. When the disk A disappears the boundary knots of the disks B and\nC cross and therefore the linking number of B, C jumps. Similarly, disappearing\nof an n-disk is compensated by the discontinuity in the m-disk contribution for\nm > n.\nIn [4], we apply the analysis of this paper to non-compact situations. This\nincludes a mathematical definition of the invariants arising in Large N duality.\nIn the sequel [3] we consider the case that H1 (L, Q) 6= 0. We construct the\nOpen Gromov-Witten potential S as a homotopy class of solutions of the Master\nequation in the ring of functions on H \u2217 (L, Q) with coefficients in the Novikov ring.\nThis is the effective action of the Open Topological String of [7]. S is defined up\nto master homotopy, unique up to equivalence. The evaluation of S on its critical\npoints leads to numerical invariants.\n\n\fOPEN GROMOV-WITTEN THEORY ON CALABI-YAU THREE-FOLDS I\n\n3\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section two we define the Kuranishi space\nof multi-disks. The orientation of the moduli space of disks induces an orientation\non the moduli space of multi-disks. We show how the boundary faces of the space\nof multi-disks can be identified with some subspaces of different components.\nIn section three we define the notion of systems of chains. This is the main\nalgebraic topological object in which we will be interested.\nIn section four we introduce the constrain on the perturbation of the Kuranishi\nstructure of multi-disks. With this constrain, we show that the evaluation on the\npunctures of multi-disks leads to a system of chains well defined up to homotopy.\nThis procedure is a minor adaptation of the procedure developed in [1].\nIn section five we discuss the gluing property. This property assure that the\nsystem of chains is compatible with the cut of a multi-disk along an internal edge.\nIn section five we specialize to the case that each connected component of L has\nthe rational homology of a sphere.\nIn section six we consider the higher genus case. Most of what we have said for\nmulti-disks can be adapted to multi-curves. In the case that each connected component of L has the rational homology of a sphere we define the Open Gromov-Witten\ninvariants Fg,h \u2208 Q counting multi-curves of genus g and h boundary components.\nAcknowledgements.

Multi-disks\nLet M be a Calabi-Yau three-fold and let L a Maslov index zero Lagrangian\nsubmanifold of M . In this section we define the moduli space of multi-disks with\nboundary mapped into L.\nGiven a ribbon tree T we denote by V (T ) the set of vertices of T and by E(T )\nthe set of edges of T . H(T ) is the set of edges of T with an assigned orientation, or\nequivalently the set of half-edges of T . Thus for each internal edge there correspond\ntwo elements of H(T ), and for each external edge there is one element of H(T ), the\noriented edge starting in the unique vertex. For v \u2208 V (T ), H(v) denotes the set of\noriented edges starting from v.\nDefinition 1. A decorated tree is a ribbon tree T with a relative homology class\nAv \u2208 H2 (M, L) assigned to each vertex v. If Av 6= 0 the vertex v can have arbitrary\nvalence. If Av = 0 the valence of v has to be at least 3.\nThe relative homology\nclass of T is by definition the sum of the homology classes\nP\nof its vertices A = v\u2208V (T ) Av . We denote by T the set of decorated trees and by\nT (A) the set of decorated trees in the homology class A.\nFix a compatible almost-complex structure J on M . Let Mn (A) be the moduli\nspace of pseudo-holomorphic disks with n marked points with a fixed cyclic order\nin the relative homology class A \u2208 H2 (X, L) (this is usualy denoted the main\ncomponent in [2]). By Chapter 7 of [2], Mn (A) can be endowed with a weakly\nsubmersive Kuranishi structure with corners.\nFor each v \u2208 V (T ) denote by Mv a copy of MH(v) (Av ) where we consider the\nboundary marked points labeled with the half edges H(v) starting in v, respecting\nthe cyclic order of the ribbon structure.\n\n\f4\n\nVITO IACOVINO\n\nThe moduli space of T -multi-disks MT is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nY\nMT = \uf8ed\nMv \uf8f8 /Aut(T ).\nv\u2208V (T )\n\nThe space MT has a natural Kuranishi structure. Moreover this Kuranishi structure has a tangent space.\n2.1. Boundary. Fix a decorated tree T . For each v \u2208 V (T ) the boundary of Mv\ncan be decomposed into different components\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(1)\n\n\uf8ec\n\u2202(MH(v) (Av )) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nG\n\nH1 \u222aH2 =H(v)\nA1 +A2 =A\n\n\uf8f7\nM{H1 \u222a\u2217} (A1 ) \u00d7L M{H2 \u222a\u2217} (A2 )\uf8f7\n\uf8f8 /Z2 .\n\nHere the union is taken over the decompositions H = H1 \u2294 H2 preserving the cyclic\norder. The marked point \u2217 is the singular point associated to the boundary face.\nThe fiber product in the left is defined using the evaluation map in \u2217.\nIn the case that H(v) is empty we need to add an extra term to (1):\n(2)\n\n\u2202M0 = (M1 \u00d7L M1 )/Z2 \u2294 M0,1 \u00d7M L.\n\nHere M0,1 is the moduli space of J-pseudo-holomorphic spheres with one marked\npoint. The last term of (2) comes from the bubbling of the spheres from constant\ndisks. It has been discussed in section 7.4 of [2]. These are the boundary nodes of\ntype E in Definition 3.4 of [5].\nFor each v \u2208 V (T ) define\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nY\nMv\u2032 \uf8f8 /Aut(T, v).\n(3)\n\u2202v MT = \uf8ed\u2202Mv \u00d7\nv \u2032 6=v\n\nThe boundary of MT can be subdivided into the Kuranishi spaces \u2202v MT\nG\n\u2202MT =\n\u2202v MT .\nv\u2208V (T )\n\nFor each e \u2208 E(T ) internal edge let\n\u0001\n\u2202e MT = (eve )\u22121 (\u2206) /Aut(T, e)\nQ\nwhere \u2206 \u2282 L\u00d7L is the diagonal and eve : v\u2208V (T ) Mv \u2192 L\u00d7L is the evaluation on\nthe punctures associated to e. Observe that eve is a submersion since the Kuranishi\nstructure on the disks was taken weakly submersive. This implies that \u2202e MT has\na natural Kuranishi structure.\nThe definition (4) can be generalized to more edges. For e1 , e2 internal edges of\nT we define\n\u0001\n\u2202e1 ,e2 MT = (eve1 )\u22121 (\u2206) \u2229 (eve2 )\u22121 (\u2206) /Aut(T, e1 , e2 ).\n(4)\n\nThis is a Kuanishi space again because the Kuranishi structures on the disks was\ntaken weakly submersive. We also have\n\u2202e1 ,e2 MT = \u2202e1 MT \u2293 \u2202e2 MT .\nThe intersections between more of spaces (4) can be discussed in a similar way.\n\n\fOPEN GROMOV-WITTEN THEORY ON CALABI-YAU THREE-FOLDS I\n\n5\n\nDefinition 2. Let e \u2208 E(T ) be an internal edge attached to the vertices v1 , v2 . The\ndecorated tree T /e is the tree obtained by contracting e to a vertex e/e. The relative\nhomology class of the vertex e/e is the sum of the homology classes of the vertices\nv1 and v2 , Ae/e = Av1 + Av2 .\nThe Kuranishi space \u2202v MT is subdivided in boundary faces of MT . In fact we\nhave:\nLemma 1. If T has at least one edge, there is an isomorphism of Kuranishi spaces:\nG\n(5)\n\u2202v MT \u223c\n\u2202e\u2032 MT \u2032\n=\n(T \u2032 /e\u2032 ,e\u2032 /e\u2032 )=(T,v)\n\nwhere the union is over all the trees T \u2032 and edges e\u2032 \u2208 E(T \u2032 ) such that (T \u2032 /e\u2032 , e\u2032 /e\u2032 ) =\n(T, v).\nLet T0 be the tree with no edges and one vertex v. There is an isomorphism of\nKuranishi spaces:\n(6)\n\n\u2202v MT0 = \u2202e MT1 \u2294 M0,1 \u00d7M L\n\nwhere T1 is the graph given by two vertices connected by an edge e.\nProof. The lemma is immediate from the definition. Consider first (6) and let T1\nbe the graph given by two vertices w, z connected by an edge e. By definition we\nhave\n\u2202e MT1 = ((Mw \u00d7 Mz ) \u00d7L2 \u2206)/Z2 .\nand equation (2) Where the fiber products are made using the evaluation map as\nusual. Therefore formula (6) follows from\n(M1 \u00d7L M1 ) = (M1 \u00d7 M1 ) \u00d7L2 \u2206\nIn the same way we can prove (5) using (1).\n\n\u0003\n\nIn order to deal with the last term in relation (6) we need to consider an extra\nKuranishi space. We assume that the homology class of L in M is trivial. Let\nB \u2208 C4 (M ) be a singular chain such that \u2202B = L. For a fixed B we can consider\nthe fiber product\n(7)\n\nM0,1 \u00d7M B\n\nas Kuranishi space.

Define\noT = (\u2297e\u2208E(T ) oe ) \u2297 oex\nwhere\noe = {set of orientations of the edge e} \u223c\n= Z2\nand\noex = {set of parities of the ordering of the external edges of T } \u223c\n= Z2 .\nFor each vertex v \u2208 V (T ), let M0,v be a copy of the moduli space of disks\nwithout punctures in the homology class Av .\n\n\f6\n\nVITO IACOVINO\n\nWe can identify MT with an open subset of\nY\nY\n\u2202De\nM0,v \u00d7\nv\u2208V (T )\n\ne\u2208E(T )\n\nwhere \u2202De is the boundary of the disk from where the edge e starts. It follows\nthat an orientation of the moduli space of disks induces an orientation of MT with\ntwisted coefficients oT\nNow, assume that L is oriented and spin. By Section 44 of [2], M0,v has a\nnatural orientation. Therefore we have:\nLemma 2. There exists a natural orientation of MT with twisted coefficients oT .\nNow we want to study how the isomorphisms of Lemma 1 are related to this\norientation.\nLemma 3.

Invariance. The Kuranishi structure we constructed depends on the various\nchoices we made. However we have the following (the proof is minor adaptation of\nthe proof of Theorem 17.11 of [1]):\nTheorem 8. The system of singular chains WT depends on the almost complex\nstructure J and various choice we made to define a Kuranishi structure. Different choices lead to systems of singular chains that are homotopic, with homotopy\ndetermined up to equivalence.\nProof. Let J and J \u2032 be two different complex structures compatible with the symplectic structure \u03c9. Let Js be a family of compatible almost complex structures\nsuch that Js = J for s \u2208 [0, \u03b5] and Js = J \u2032 for s \u2208 [1 \u2212 \u03b5, 1]. Define\nMT (Jpara ) = \u222as\u2208[0,1] {s} \u00d7 MT (Js ).\nAs in Theorem 17.11 of [1] we can endow MT (Jpara ) with a compact and Hausdorff\ntopology. Moreover there exists a Kuranishi structure on MT (Jpara ) that extends\nthe Kuranishi structure of MT (J) and MT (J \u2032 ).\nLemma 9 implies that there exist a transverse multisection s as close as we want\nto s in the C 0 topology, satisfying Condition 6. Moreover s can be taken to extend\nassigned perturbations of MT (J) and MT (J \u2032 ).\nAs in formulas (13) and (14), s defines a singular chain YT in [0, 1] \u00d7 LT for\neach tree T . Lemma 4.7 of [1] implies that \u2202YT is the intersection of YT with the\nboundary of MT (Jpara ):\n\u2202YT = ev\u2217 ((s|\u22121\n\u2202M\n\nT (Jpara )\n\n)(0))\n\nThe system of chains YT = {YT }T \u2208T defines a homotopy between the system of\nchains WT and WT\u2032 .\n\u0003\nLemma 9. There exists a perturbation s of the Kuranishi structure of MT (J)\nsatisfying condition 6.\n\n\f10\n\nVITO IACOVINO\n\nProof. The construction of the multi-sections is done using the standard machinery\nof Kuranishi structures developed in [1] or Appendix A of [2].\nWe will proceed by induction on the number of internal edges of the tree. In\neach step we impose condition 6.\nSuppose first that T is a tree with no internal edges (that is a vertex with some\nexternal edge). In this case MT is the usual space of disks with boundary punctures.\nHere we can just pick a multi-section s transverse to the zero section.\nNow consider a tree T with at least one internal edge and assume that s has been\nconstructed for all the trees with fewer internal edges than T . For each internal\nedge e \u2208 E(T ), condition 6 defines a multi-section on \u2202e MT in terms of the multisection of \u2202v MT /e (where v is the vertex of T /e corresponding to the edge e).\nBy induction these multi-sections are compatible on the intersection. In fact (for\ne1 , e2 \u2208 E(T ) be two internal edges) the multi-section on \u2202e1 MT and on \u2202e2 MT\nrestricted to \u2202e1 ,e2 MT are both defined from the multi-section on \u2202v1 ,v2 MT /{e1 ,e2 }\n(a codimension two corner).\nWe have therefore defined a multi-section on \u2294e \u2202e MT . Lemma 17.4 of [1] or\nTheorem A1.23 of [2] can be used to extend this multi-section to a transverse\nmulti-section of MT .\n\u0003\n5.

However it is easy to see that (17) is inconsistent with the transversality\nalong diagonals of a system of chains. Instead now we define the notion of gluing\nproperty up to homotopy and prove that it holds for the system of chains we are\ninterested in.\nWe replace formula (17) with the weaker assumption that there exists a homotopy YT 1 between the right and left side of (17). As usual we want that YT 1 is\nuniquely determinated up to homotopy. We also need to assure that if we made\ntwo cuts in the tree, the result is independent of the order of the cut. More precisely\nwe have:\nDefinition 6. WT has the the gluing property up to homotopy if it is assigned an\nequivalence class of homotopies YT 1 between WT 1 and WT 0,1 \u00d7 WT 0,1 such that the\nhomotopy between WT 2 and WT 0,1 \u00d7 WT 0,2 \u00d7 WT 0,1\n(18)\n\nYT 2 \u25e6 (WT 0,1 \u00d7 YT 1,1 )\n\nis invariant (up to equivalence) under the Z2 action that switch order of the marked\nedges.\nIn (18), T 2 is the set of decorated trees with two marked ordered internal edges,\nYT 2 is the lift of YT 1 to an homotopy on T 2 , that is an homotopy between WT 2\nand WT 0,1 \u00d7 WT 1,1 .\nLet WT be a system of chains defined as in formula (13) . Recall that two different\nperturbations lead to homotopic systems of chains with homotopy determined up\nto equivalence.\nProposition 10. WT has the gluing property up to homotopy.\nProof. Let s1 and s0,1 be the lifting of s as pertubation of MT 1 (J) and MT 0,1 (J)\nrespectively. Because of (15), there is an isomorphism\n(19)\nMT 1 \u223c\n= (MT 0,1 \u00d7 MT 0,1 )/Z2\nThere is also an obvious way to extend condition 7 to T 1 . We do not impose\nthe condition associated to the marked edge.\nThere exists a pertubation s\u03031 of MT 1 \u00d7 [0, 1] that satisfies (the one parameter\nversion) of this condition and such that restricted to MT 1 \u00d7{1} agrees with s0,1 \u00d7s0,1\nand restricted to MT \u00d7 {0} agrees with s1 .\nFrom s\u03031 we can construct the homotopy YT 1 required in Definition 6.\n\u0003\n6. Linking number and Gromov-Witten invariants\nIn this section we assume that each connected component of L has the rational\nhomology of a sphere. We apply the formalism of the previous sections to define the\nopen Gromov-Witten invariants. We show that in each equivalence class of system\nof chains with the gluing property there exists a special element. This element is\ncharacterized by rational numbers. These are the open Gromov-Witten invariants.\nThe construction is based on generalized linking numbers. We extend the notion\nof linking number of two curves to a system of chains with gluing property up to\nhomotopy.\n\n\f12\n\nVITO IACOVINO\n\nLet us start recalling the definition of linking number between curves on a 3sphere suitable for our proposes. Let \u03b31 and \u03b32 be two curves on L. We will think\nto \u03b31 and \u03b32 as 1-chains on L. The product \u03b31 \u00d7 \u03b32 defines a 2-chain in L \u00d7 L which\nis homologically trivial because H1 (L, Q) = 0.\nMoreover the product structure of \u03b31 \u00d7 \u03b32 distinguishes a particular class of 3chain C in [0, 1] \u00d7 L \u00d7 L transversal to the boundary such that \u2202C = {0} \u00d7 \u03b31 \u00d7 \u03b32\nas follows. There exists B1 , B2 \u2208 C2 ([[0, 1] \u00d7 L]) such that \u2202B1 = {0} \u00d7 \u03b31 and\n\u2202B2 = {0} \u00d7 \u03b32 . Since H2 (L, Q) = 0, B1 and B2 are unique up to equivalence.\nThe homotopies C1 = B1 \u00d7 \u03b32 and C2 = \u03b31 \u00d7 B2 are equivalent. Take C in\nthis equivalence class. The linking number between \u03b31 and \u03b32 is defined by the\nintersection number of C with the diagonal.\nWe now generalize the definition of linking number to a system of chains. For this\nwe have to consider more general trees, where the case of two curves corresponds to\nthe tree with two vertices joint by an edge. Moreover we have to deal with singular\nchains that are not just the product of 1-chains. In the case of two curves the\nproduct structure was critical to define uniquely the homotopy. In the general case\nwe will use the gluing property up to homotopy.\nDenote by T0 the set of decorated tree with no edges (and therefore exactly one\nvertex).\nT0 = {T0 (A)}A\u2208H2 (X,L)\nwhere T0 (A) is the decorated tree with no edges and with vertex in the relative\nhomological class A.\nProposition 11. Let WT be a system of chains with the gluing property up to\nhomotopy.\nThere exists a uniquely determined system of chains WT\u2032 homotopic to WT such\nthat\nWT\u2032 = 0\nfor every T \u2208\n/ T0 .\nProof. We will construct the homotopy using an iterative argument. In this process\nwe provide a recipe that identifies uniquely the homotopy up to equivalence. This\nis essentially based on the gluing property.\nFix A \u2208 H2 (X, L) and let l be an integer. Assume that the homotopy has been\nconstructed for all the trees with symplectic area strictly less than \u03c9(A) or with\narea equal to \u03c9(A) and number of external edges less than l.\nLet Tmax \u2208 T (A) be a decorated tree in the homology class A with l external\nedges and maximal number of internal edges. Formula (9) implies \u2202WTmax = 0.\nUsing the gluing property first and the fact that H1 (L, Q) = 0 after we can construct\nan homotopy YTmax \u2208 C\u2217 ([0, 1] \u00d7 LTmax ) between WTmax and the zero singular\nchain. YTmax uniquely up to equivalence since H2 (L, Q) = 0 and YTmax has been\nconstructed using the gluing property. Lemma 12 implies that we can extend YTmax\nto an homotopy of system of chains. The resulting system of chain has Tmax component equal to zero.\nWe now iterate the argument. Consider a tree Tn with l external edges and suppose that YT has been constructed for all the trees T with more internal edges than\nTn such that (10) holds with WT\u2032 = 0. Assume also that YT has been constructed\nusing the recipe from the gluing property as above.\n\n\fOPEN GROMOV-WITTEN THEORY ON CALABI-YAU THREE-FOLDS I\n\n13\n\nFor each vertex v \u2208 V (Tn ), let Tv be the set of trees with homological class Av\nand external edges H(v). Let TTn be the set trees T made from Tn replacing each\nvertex v of Tn by an element of Tv . That is\nY\nTv )/Aut(Tn )\nTTn = (\nv\u2208V (Tn )\n\nBy induction on each Tv we have an homotopy to the zero system of chain. The\nproduct of these homotopies defines an homotopy on TTn to the zero system of\nchain. On the other hand on TTn \\ {Tn } we have the homotopy contructed before\nYT . Since both these homotopies have been contructed using the recipe from the\ngluing property, they have to be equivalent. This determines an homotopy between\nWTn and the zero sistem of chain.\nBy iterative argument we construct WT\u2032 as in the proposition. The unicity follows\nsince the homotopy YT is determinated up to equivalence.\n\u0003\nLemma 12. Let WT be as system of chains. Assume that for each tree T with\n|E(T )| > l is assigned a singular chains WT\u2032 \u2208 C|E(T )| ([0, 1] \u00d7 LT , oT ) and YT \u2208\nC|E(T )|+1 ([0, 1] \u00d7 LT , oT ) such that formula (10) holds. Then the set {WT\u2032 } can be\ncompleted to a system of chains WT\u2032 such that the set {YT } can be completed to\na homotopy YT between WT and WT\u2032 . Moreover the homotopy YT can be taken\nunique up to equivalence.\nProof. We construct YT by iteration starting from the trees with maximal number\nof edges with fixed number of external edges.

Let WT the system of chains (13). The rational number link(WT (A) )\nis defined and it does not depend on the almost complex structure and various\nchoices we made to define a Kuranishi structure.\nProof. By Lemma 10, WT has the gluing property up to homotopy. Therefore\nwe can apply Proposition 11 to define link(WT (A) ). Theorem 8 implies that this\nrational number does not depend on any choice we made.\n\u0003\nWe can now define the Open Gromov-Witten invariants that count multi-disks\nin the relative homology class A \u2208 H2 (X, L) as\nF0,1 (A) = link(WT (A) )\nIt also easy to see how F0,1 (A) depends on the singular chain B that we have used\nto define (7). Assume that B \u2032 \u2208 C4 (M ) is another singular chain with \u2202B \u2032 = L.\nSince B \u2212 B \u2032 is a cycle we have\n(21)\n\n\u2032\n(A) = ev\u2217 ([M0,1 (A)]) \u2229 (B \u2212 B \u2032 ).\nF0,1 (A) \u2212 F0,1\n\n7. Higher genus\nIn this section we generalize the previous analysis to higher-genus curves. Most of\nwhat we said for disks can be extended to higher-genus straightforwardly. Therefore\nwe will only comment to the main differences.\nIn this section we assume that L is spin. This assumption assures that all the\nmoduli spaces we consider are oriented (see [5]).\n\u2212\n7.1. Multi-curves.
