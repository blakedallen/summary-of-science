Introduction\nThe brightest source on the radio sky \u2013 a supernova remnant\nCassiopeia A \u2013 is so close and so young that the best instruments\nare able to observe exceptionally fine details in its rich structure\nin different spectral bands. One of the most interesting phenomena are dense ejecta blobs of the supernova explosion, observed\nas numerous bright optical \"fast-moving knots\" (FMKs). These\nknots radiate mostly in [O iii] doublet near 5000 \u00c5 and other forbidden lines of oxygen, sulphur, silicon and argon.\nEarly observations using 200-inch telescope on Mount\nPalomar (Baade & Minkowski 1954; Minkowski & Aller 1954;\nMinkowski 1957) demonstrated that the emitting knot plasma\nhas temperatures about 2 \u00d7 104 K and electron densities about\n104 cm\u22123 . Very unusual spectra of the fast-moving knots have\nlead Shklovskii (1968) to suggestion, later confirmed by detailed measurements and analysis (Peimbert & van den Bergh\n1971; Chevalier & Kirshner 1978, 1979), that they have extremely high abundances of some of heavy elements. Some of\nthe knots consist of up to 90% of oxygen, others contain predominantly heavier elements, such as silicon, sulphur, argon and\ncalcium (Chevalier & Kirshner 1979; Hurford & Fesen 1996).\nIt was also discovered that a typical lifetime of a FMK is\nof the order of 10-30 years. Existing knots disappear, but other\nbright knots appear on the maps of Cassiopeia A (hereafter\nCas A).\n\u22c6\n\nTables 5 to 23 are only available in electronic form at the CDS via\nanonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/\n\nDetailed Chandra observations (Hughes et al. 2000;\nHwang et al. 2004) revealed presence of similar knots in X-rays,\nbeing very bright in spectral lines of hydrogen- and helium-like\nions of silicon and sulphur and showing traces of heavily\nabsorbed oxygen X-ray lines.\nSimilar bright optical knots are observed in other oxygenrich supernova remnants (e.g., Puppis A, N132D, etc.,\nSutherland & Dopita (1995a)), but the case of Cas A is the most\npromising for further investigations.\nThe FMK optical spectra were first treated as the shock wave\nemission by Chevalier & Kirshner (1978, 1979). Subsequently\nit was understood that used shock models, that assumed solar\nabundances, are inappropriate for the case of the FMK plasma,\nas its high metal abundances result in a different shock structure.\nThere have been published several theoretical models describing the shock emission in pure oxygen plasmas (Itoh\n1981a,b; Borkowski & Shull 1990) and oxygen-dominated plasmas (Sutherland & Dopita 1995b, hereafter SD95). In these\nmodels, the reverse shock of the supernova remnant encounters a dense knot and decelerates entering its dense medium\n(Zel'dovich & Raizer 1967; McKee & Cowie 1975) to velocities\nof several hundred km/s. Shortly after the shock wave enters the\ncloud, the material ahead of the shock front is ionized by the\nradiation from the heated gas after the shock front. All the theoretical models assume a shock wave propagation with a constant\nvelocity through a constant density cloud.\nThe optical emission is formed in two relatively thin layers: one immediately following the shock front, where plasma\nrapidly cools from X-ray emitting temperatures of about 5 \u00d7\n106 K down to below 103 K; another at the photoionization front\n\n\f2\n\nD. Docenko and R.A. Sunyaev: Optical and NIR recombination lines from Cas A knots\n\nbefore the shock wave. The relatively cold layers having temperatures below 105 K contribute most strongly to the line emission,\nas approximate pressure equilibrium results in much higher densities and emission measures of these regions.\nImportant detail is that the recombination time is much\nlonger than the plasma cooling time. Therefore recombining and\ncooling plasma simultaneously contains ions in vastly different\nionization stages at all temperatures down to several hundred\nKelvins \u2013 the plasma is in a non-equilibrium ionization state. It\nwould be very important to find a way to confirm experimentally\nthis prediction of the computational models.\nIt is interesting to note that predictions of various theoretical models differ in many ways. For example, as we show in\nan accompanying article (Docenko & Sunyaev, to be submitted),\nthe model predictions of the fine-structure far-infrared line intensities differ by several orders of magnitude. We also show\nthere that the models of SD95 and of Borkowski & Shull (1990)\nare the best of available ones in reproducing the far-infrared line\nemission of the fast-moving knots, although each of them is only\nprecise up to a factor of several.\nNevertheless, these two theoretical models still have\na lot of differences between them. For example, in the\nBorkowski & Shull (1990) models the O4+ and higher-ionized\nspecies are essentially absent, whereas in the SD95 model the\nO6+ is the dominant ion after the shock at temperatures above\nabout 5000 K. Unfortunately, O4+ , O5+ and O6+ ions have no\ncollisionally-excited lines in visible and infrared ranges, and\ntheir ultraviolet and soft X-ray lines are almost or completely\nundetectable due to high interstellar absorption on the way from\nthe Cas A.\nFrom large differences between the theoretical model predictions it is clear that they have lack of observational constraints\nand more diagnostic information in form of various line ratios is\nneeded to pin down the true structure of fast-moving knots. Part\nof such information can be obtained from the far-infrared lines.\nIn this paper we argue that still more information may be\nobtained from metal recombination lines (RL) in optical and\nnear-infrared spectral ranges. These lines arise in the transitions between highly-excited levels (principal quantum number\nn \u2248 5 \u2212 10) populated by the processes of dielectronic and radiative recombination. The RLs are emitted by all ionic species,\nincluding, for example, O4+ and O5+ that have no other lines\ndetectable from the Cas A.\nUnfortunately, the collisional excitation process that is much\nmore efficient at exciting lines corresponding to transitions between lowest excited states, is negligibly weak at excitation\nof high-n levels. Therefore, emissivities of the RLs are normally several orders of magnitude weaker than ones of the\ncollisionally-excited lines, but, as we show in this article, intensities of the recombination lines from the FMKs are reaching\ndetectable levels.\nFor oxygen-dominated knots, using plasma parameters\n(electron temperature, density and emission measure of the gas\nat different distances from the shock wave) from the SD95 model\nwith the 200 km/s shock speed we have computed the spectrum in the optical and near-infrared bands accessible by the\nmodern ground-based telescopes. The cloud shock speed in the\nCas A FMKs of about 200 km/s is determined by SD95 from the\ncomparison of observed optical spectra with their model predictions. Although similar analysis based on the Borkowski & Shull\n(1990) model would also be valuable, the original article does\nnot give enough information to allow us to compute the RL\nfluxes (e.g., the ionization state distributions as functions of tem-\n\nperature cannot be resolved from the plots in the regions significantly contributing to the recombination line emission).\nThe lines under consideration are predicted to be 300 \u2212 500\ntimes weaker than e.g. the [O iii] line at 5007 \u00c5. However,\ntheir fluxes are well above the sensitivity of the best presentday telescopes. These fluxes are only 2\u20135 times weaker than\nthe detection limits of observations done in 1970's and later on\nthe 200-inch and smaller telescopes (Peimbert & van den Bergh\n1971; Chevalier & Kirshner 1979; Hurford & Fesen 1996).\nObservations of these lines do not demand high spectral resolution due to velocity spreads and turbulence in the shocked\nplasma, as well as due to intrinsic line splitting.\nThe recombination lines discussed below are radiated by all\ncoexisting ionized oxygen species, from O+ to O6+ . Study of\nthese lines will permit to observe in details the process of the\nnon-equilibrium cooling and recombination of the pre- and postshock plasmas overabundant with oxygen or sulphur and silicon.\nThe discussed spectral lines allow to observe the coldest ionized pre-shock and post-shock regions in the FMKs, that are not\npossible to detect using the ground-based observations by any\nother means. The fine-structure far-infrared emission lines are\nalso able to give such information, but demand an observatory\nto be located outside the atmosphere and cannot reach angular\nresolution sufficient to distinguish individual knots.\nObservations of recombination lines of elements other than\noxygen will allow to improve our knowledge on many yet unknown physical parameters characterizing the Cas A ejecta.\nThe metal recombination lines may be a promising tool\nalso for studies of other oxygen-rich supernova remnants like\nPuppis A, N132D, G292+1.8, etc.\nThe paper structure is following. In the second Section we\ndescribe our method of the recombination line flux computation. In the Section 3 we apply the method to predict the optical and near-infrared line fluxes from the optical knots in\nCassiopeia A and compare them with existing observational constraints. Description of the recombination line substructure allowing to identify the parent ion is given in the Section 4. In the\nSection 5 we discuss the ways to get information about physical\nparameters of the emitting region from the line ratios. Finally, in\nSection 6 we conclude the article.\n\n2. Computation of recombination line fluxes\nIn the process of radiative recombination, especially at low temperatures (when kT is at least several times below the ionization\npotential), significant part of electrons recombine onto excited\nstates. Dielectronic recombination for majority of heavy ions\npopulate excited states even more efficiently than the radiative\nrecombination.\nIn low-density plasmas such recombination onto excited\nstates, characterized by quantum numbers (nl), is followed by\nthe electron radiative cascade to the ground state and emission\nof multiple photons in the course of the cascade. In case of recombining highly-charged ions, these photons are emitted in microwave, infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectral bands.\nIn this paper we describe the lines produced as a result of\nsuch radiative cascade, when both collisional and induced transitions of the type (nl) \u2192 (n\u2032 l\u2032 ) are unimportant. The only nonradiative process influencing electron cascade in our model are\nthe collisional (nl) \u2192 (nl\u2032 ) transitions, as they have much higher\ncross sections and significantly affect the level populations at relatively low n. They also are the main reason of changes of the\nrecombination line emissivities with electron density.\n\n\fD. Docenko and R.A. Sunyaev: Optical and NIR recombination lines from Cas A knots\n\n2.1. Elementary processes\n\nIn the current work we account for the following processes:\n\u2013 Radiative recombination (RR). Its level-specific rates\nqRR (nl; T e) were computed as described in Appendix B.1.\n\u2013 Dielectronic\nrecombination (DR). Its level-specific\nP\nrates\n\u03b3 qDR (\u03b3, nl; T e ) were computed as described in\nAppendix B.2.\n\u2013 Radiative transitions. Their rates Anl,n\u2032 l\u2032 were computed using\nhydrogenic formulae with radial integral expressions from\nGordon (1929). This may be not accurate for non-hydrogenic\nions at l < 3, but electrons recombined to those low-l states\nmostly transit to n\u2032 \u2248 l and do not contribute to the optical\nRL emission1 .\n\u2013 Collisional l-redistribution. Its rates Cnl,nl\u2032 were computed using sudden collision approximation expressions\nfrom Pengelly & Seaton (1964) and Summers (1977), in the\nregion of their applicability. Outside it (where maximum cutoff parameter rmax becomes less than the minimum one rmin ),\nwe approximated the Vrinceanu & Flannery (2001) classical\nexpressions introducing cut-off at large impact parameters\nequal to rmax . Details of this approximation are of minor im2\nportance, since the cross sections are proportional as the rmax\n,\nbeing therefore relatively small. Energies of (nl)-levels and\ntheir differences determining the collisional rates in many\ncases, were computed as described in Appendix B.4.\nUsage of hydrogenic approximation does not allow us to reliably compute emissivities and wavelengths of the lines corresponding to transitions involving levels n < 4. Therefore we do\nnot provide the results concerning these levels.\nDetails of the atomic physics and approximations utilized for\ncomputations of the line emissivities are given in Appendix B.\n2.2.

This results in some,\npossibly significant, underestimate of the cooling region line\nfluxes arising from recombinations of O2+ ions. Though, as we\nshow below, the O ii recombination lines from the photoionized\nregion are expected to be much brighter.\nIt should be remembered that, e.g., O v recombination lines\narise in the radiative cascade in the O4+ ion triggered by the\nrecombination of O5+ ion, so the line fluxes are proportional to\nthe ionic abundance of O5+ , not O4+ .\n\n3. Astrophysical application: FMKs in Cassiopeia A\nThe SD95 model describes fast-moving knot emission as arising\nin the interaction of the oxygen-dominated dense cloud with the\nexternal shock wave, entering the cloud and propagating through\nit (see Figure 2). The heated region just after the shock front\nproduces high flux of the ionizing radiation that results in appearance of two photoionized regions: before and after the shock\nfront.\nThe plasma after the shock front passage is rapidly cooling and, at temperatures of (1 \u2212 5) \u00d7 104 K, emitting\nthe lines observable in the visible and near-infrared spectra (Chevalier & Kirshner 1978, 1979; Hurford & Fesen 1996;\nGerardy & Fesen 2001). Thickness of this emitting layer is extremely small (about 1012 \u2212 1013 cm), but due to the high density\nof the cooling material at T < 105 K it is able to produce bright\nemission lines of highly-ionized atomic species, such as [O iii].\nThis region also gives rise to the recombination line (RL) emission.\n\n\fD.

Until now, even the presence of this region\nis disputed (Itoh 1986) because, if present, it would produce too\nbright optical lines of neutral oxygen.\nBetween the photoionization front and the shock wave the\nplasma is predicted to be extremely cold (T e < 103 K) and rather\nhighly ionized (ionic abundances of O3+ and O2+ are about 60%\nand 30% in the SD95 200 km/s shock model). This cold ionized\nregion, invisible in optical and X-ray bands, should be actively\nrecombining and emitting bright recombination lines.\nResulting RL emission computed based on the SD95\n200 km/s shock model is described separately in the following\nsubsections for each of these two regions: after and before the\nshock front.\nIn this Section we provide results on the l-summed recombination line fluxes, whereas in the Section 4 we discuss in details\nthe individual line spectral substructure, that separates in some\ncases the recombination lines into several components, thus diminishing the individual component fluxes up to factors of 2\u20134.\n\n5\n\n2+\n\nIonization: O \u2192 O\n5+\n6+\nIonization: O \u2192 O\n6+\n5+\nRecombination: O \u2192 O\n2+\n+\nRecombination: O \u2192 O\nCooling timescale\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n10\nTemperature, K\n\n6\n\n10\n\nFig. 3. Oxygen ion O6+ and O2+ recombination and ionization\ntimescales as compared to the plasma cooling time using the\nelectron density dependence on temperature and the cooling\nfunction from the SD95 model with 200 km/s cloud shock speed.\n\n3.1. Cooling region after the shock front\n\nIt is useful to make order-of-magnitude estimates of some\ntimescales in the post-shock rapidly cooling plasma at temperatures between several hundred and 3\u00d7104 K, where the recombination line emission occurs (see below). As derived from SD95\nmodel, the plasma cooling time is roughly equal to\n\u03c4cool =\n\n3 (nt + ne )kT e\n\u2248 2 \u00d7 104 s T 41/2 n\u22121\nt,5 ,\n2 nt ne \u039b\n\nwhere T e = 104 T 4 K and nt = 105 nt,5 cm\u22123 . It should be compared with the time needed to reach the collisional ionization\nequilibrium (CIE), that is in our caseis approximately equal to\nthe recombination timescale \u03c4rec . For example, for ion O2+ and\nO6+ the recombination time is\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u03c4rec (O6+ ) = ne qRR,O6+ (T e ) \u2248 4.7 \u00d7 105 s T 40.64 n\u22121\ne,5 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u03c4rec (O2+ ) = ne qRR,O2+ (T e ) \u2248 4.9 \u00d7 106 s T 40.64 n\u22121\ne,5 ,\n\nwhere ne = 105 ne,5 cm\u22123 and qRR,O2+ is the total radiative recombination rate for this ion, taken from Pequignot et al. (1991). It is\neasy to see that the recombination timescale in this temperature\ninterval is always longer than the cooling time for any abundant\nion. Therefore the plasma is strongly overionized for its temperature, that results in high emissivities of the recombination lines.\nThe quantitative comparison of these timescales in the model\nis given on Figure 3, where ionization and recombination\ntimescales for several ions are compared with the cooling time.\nAt high temperatures the cooling timescale is longer than the\nionization timescales and the material has enough time to converge to the CIE. At T e < 106 K the cooling is much faster\nthan the recombination down to temperatures of several hundred\nKelvin and the high ionization state is stays \"frozen\" until very\nlow temperatures are reached.\nLet us now compare the thermalization timescales and mean\nfree paths to the quantities determined above. Following Spitzer\n(1956), the electron or ion self-collision timescale is equal to\n\u03c4c = 114 s\n\nA1/2 T 43/2\n,\nn5 Z 4 ln \u039bC\n\nwhere A is the atomic weight (equal to 1/1836 for electrons), Z is\nthe particle charge, n = 105 n5 cm\u22123 is the particle concentration\n\n3/2\nand \u039bC \u2248 3.92\u00d7107 n\u22121/2\ne,5 T 4 . In our case of the highly-charged\nplasma having Z \u226b 1 the timescale of the ion-ion collisions is\neven shorter than for the electron-electron collisions.\nNevertheless, the mean free path even for electrons \u03bbe stays\nsignificantly below any other characteristic scale, including the\ntypical temperature change length scale of more than 1012 cm:\np\n\u03bbe = \u03c4c,e 3kT e /me \u2248 1 \u00d7 107 cm T 42 n\u22121\ne,5 .\n\nFor illustration of the characteristic conditions after the passage of the shock front, on Figure 4 we show Li-like O5+ ion\ndensity as function of plasma temperature for this region4. The\nfigure demonstrates incredibly high abundance of this ion in relatively dense plasma with T < 3 \u00d7 104 K after the shock front,\nmuch higher than in the CIE, where this ion exists only in a narrow temperature range T e = (2 \u2212 7) \u00d7 105 K (Mazzotta et al.\n1998).\nOn the same figure we present also the oxygen emission\nmeasure distribution over temperature d(EM)/d(logT e) in the\nSD95 model. This distribution together with the line emissivity\ndependence on temperature (e.g., Fig. 1) allows one to calculate the relative contributions to the total line flux from different\ntemperature intervals (see Section 2.4 above).\nSuch line flux distributions for the prominent [O iii] line\nat 5007 \u00c5 and 8\u03b1 lines of different oxygen ions are shown\non Figure 5. Note that at low temperatures (below 4000 K),\nthe [O iii] 5007 \u00c5 line emission is dominated by contribution\nfrom the recombinaiton cascades, not the collisional excitation.\nThe cascade contribution to the post-shock intensity of this line\nreaches about 30%.\nBecause of high O6+ abundances at both low and high temperatures, the distribution of the O vi 8\u03b1 line emission is much\n4\n\nWe made our own computations of the post-shock plasma recombination and discovered that our oxygen ion distribution over ionization stages is rather similar to the one presented on the lower panel of\nFigure 3 of SD95, but only if the ion spectroscopic symbols on that figure are increased by unity. Therefore we assume that the Figure 3 of\nSD95 paper has a misprint and the ion spectroscopic symbols should be\nread, e.g., \"O VII\" instead of \"O VI\", \"O VI\" instead of \"O V\", etc.\n\n\f6\n\nD.

Expected flux\nvalues are given also in Table 3.\n3.2. Cold photoionized region\n\nThe ions in the photoionized region before the shock front are\nrapidly recombining because of their low temperature. This results in rather bright recombination lines, with fluxes proportional to the distance d between the ionization front and the\nshock wave.\nThe plain-parallel SD95 model does not determine this distance. Assumption of small optical depth of material between\nthe shock wave and the ionization front results in restriction of\nd < 1017 cm for relevant cloud models for preshock ion number density of 100 cm\u22123 (illustrated on the Figure 12 of SD95).\nBelow we take conservatively d = 1016 cm, keeping in mind that\nthe line fluxes scale linearly with it.\nThe cloud model also do not determine exact temperature\nin the photoionized region. We take T e = 1 \u00d7 103 K as a reference value, but Dopita et al. (1984) mention that it may be as\n\n\fD. Docenko and R.A.

If the real temperature in the region is less than our\nassumed value, recombination line emissivities are respectively\nhigher (see Section 5.1 below for quantitative dependences).\nPredicted oxygen line fluxes for the SD95 model OP200 with\nshock speed of 200 km/s and total preshock ion number density 100 cm\u22123 are shown on Figure 7 and given in Table 4. It is\nseen that even with our quite conservative assumptions resulting\nline fluxes are still somewhat stronger than from the shock front.\nIndeed, the predicted line brightest components are on the level\nof almost half a percent of the [O iii] 5007 \u00c5 line.\nIf they would be just a factor of several stronger, the lines\nwould have been detected in spectroscopic observations of the\nfast-moving knots (see discussion on existing observation limits\nin Section 3.4 below).\nOur estimate of the observational limit on the O iii 5\u03b1\nrecombination line flux at 0.83 \u03bcm based on the data\nby Hurford & Fesen (1996) of 0.005 \u00d7 F(5007 \u00c5) may be transformed into a joint constraint on the thickness of the photoion-\n\nassuming E(B \u2212 V) = 1.5 and O3+ ionic abundance after the\nionization front of 0.6.\nOn this example it is easy to see that detection of the lines\nor even tight upper limits will allow to perform detailed observational tests of the SD95 and other FMK models.\n3.3. Separating pre- and post-shock spectral lines\n\nObservationally, the lines formed in the regions before and after the shock wave will be distinguishable because of two effects. Firstly, the lines arising in the photoionized region yet dynamically undisturbed by the shock wave should be intrinsically\nvery narrow, but the lines arising in the post-shock region are\nexpected to be Doppler-broadened by turbulence.\nSecondly, the spectral lines arising in the post-shock region\nshould be shifted with respect to the pre-shock lines. The relative Doppler shift between these two line families appears due\nto motion of the post-shock gas relative to the initial knot speed\ninduced by the shock wave. In the strong-shock limit this velocity difference equals 3/4 \u03c5shock for specific heat ratio \u03b3 = 5/3\n(Zel'dovich & Raizer 1967), i.e. up to 150 km/s in the SD95\nmodel, but the relative Doppler shift will also depend on the angle between the shock front and the direction towards observer.\nBoth collisionally-excited and recombination lines should\ndisplay these features, but for the former group such differences\nshould be easier to detect because of higher line intensities.\nThe observations with higher spectral resolution (\u03bb/\u2206\u03bb <\n\u223c\n20 000) could also result in detection of several narrow components forming a line. They could arise from the individual\nvortice or velocity component emission, if there is only one or\na few of them dominating the plasma motions after the shock,\nlike observed in laser experiments simulating cloud-shock interaction in supernova remnants (Klein et al. 2003). The resulting spectral line profile might be quite complicated (e.g.,\nInogamov & Sunyaev (2003)), but such observations will pro-\n\n\f8\n\nD. Docenko and R.A. Sunyaev: Optical and NIR recombination lines from Cas A knots\n\nvide data on the post-shock dynamics of the fast-moving knot\nthat is presently poorly constrained from observations.\n3.4. Existing observational limits\n\nAs it is seen from Figures 6 and 7, the brightest recombination\nlines are expected to lie in the wavelength range between 0.7 and\n3 \u03bcm. Several detailed spectroscopic investigations have already\nbeen performed in this range and could have found these lines,\nprovided that they had low enough detection limits. Below we\ndiscuss such existing optical and near-infrared limits on the line\nfluxes and compare them with the SD95 model predictions.\nOptical spectra of fast-moving knots with wide spectral coverage were obtained, e.g., by Chevalier & Kirshner (1979) and\nHurford & Fesen (1996). According to the authors, the detection limits around 0.75\u20130.85 \u03bcm are about 300 times less than\nthe [O iii] 5007 \u00c5 line flux for the brightest observed features.\nOur results give flux ratios of the reddened 5007 \u00c5 line to the\nbrightest components of the O vi 8\u03b1, O v 7\u03b1 and O iii 5\u03b1 lines of\nabout 300\u2013500 (see Figures 6 and 7 and Tables 3 and 4). These\nvalues show that the model is on the boundary of consistency\nwith the observational results. They also imply that the oxygen\nrecombination line detection should be possible, provided that\nthe physics in the post-shock and pre-shock regions corresponds\nto the one described by the SD95 model.\nRecently, near-infrared (0.95\u20132.5 \u03bcm) spectra of Cas A fastmoving knots, obtained at the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope, were published by Gerardy & Fesen (2001). It is more difficult to compare their detection limits with our predictions, as there is only\none oxygen O i line blend present around 1.129 \u03bcm. It arises in\ntransitions between excited states of neutral oxygen and is also\nblended with [S i] line. If we assume that the overlapping [S i]\nline emission is negligible, our estimate of the observational detection limit corresponds to about 1/100 of the reddened optical\n[O iii] line flux. This value is a factor of several higher than the\npredicted fluxes of the O vi 9\u03b1, O v 8\u03b1 and O iii 6\u03b1 lines, also\nshowing feasibility of the line detection.\n\n4. Individual line substructure\nIn the non-relativistic hydrogenic approximation, level energies\ndepend only on the ion charge and the principal quantum number n of the level. Though, this approximation is not fully applicable for the description of the spectral lines corresponding to\ntransitions between the levels with n \u2248 10, as other effects start\nplaying a role. They arise due to energy level shifts, described in\nAppendix B.4, resulting in the \"fine\" structure appearing in the\nspectral lines. As a result, these effects help to distinguish lines\nof different elements having equal ionization stages and initial\nand final n's.\nWe calculated the line l\u2013 and K\u2013substructure following the\nmethod outlined in Appendix B.5 (K is the quantum number\nused to characterize additional interaction of the highly-excited\nelectron orbital momentum with the total angular momentum of\nother electrons, present in O ii, O iii, S ii and S iii lines). The results are shown on Figure 8 for several most interesting cases,\nassuming recombination lines having widths around 200 km/s\n(full width at half maximum level, FWHM), of the same order\nas the observed widths of forbidden optical lines (van den Bergh\n1971).\nIt is easily seen that high-l levels have both smaller quantum defects and smaller K-splitting. Complicated line structure\n\nin case of presence of the K-splitting results in weaker individual\nline fluxes making them more difficult to detect.\nOne should also keep in mind that spectral lines arising\nin transitions between lower-n levels have higher K- and lsplittings. Therefore the line components have larger separations\nand the amount of individual components increase even more\nwith each of them being respectivly less intense. As a bottomline, the near-infrared lines are more promising for the first detection than the optical ones, as they have less substructure (compare panels (b) and (c) on Figure 8).\nThe substructure of the 6\u03b1 recombination lines of Mg i, Al i\nand Si i have been observed in solar spectra near 12 \u03bcm and explained using similar, although somewhat more elaborate, theoretical description (Brault & Noyes 1983; Chang & Noyes 1983;\nChang 1984). We have used these observations as the test cases\nfor our line substructure computation code.\nIn Tables 5\u201315, available as an electronic supplement at the\nCDS, we give O ii \u2013 O vi, S ii \u2013 S v, Si ii and Si iii recombination\nline component vacuum wavelengths, emissivities and relative\nintensities in the (nlK) \u2192 (n\u2032 l\u2032 K \u2032 ) resolution for several temperatures (lg(T e , K) =3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0) in the low-density\nlimit. First seven columns characterize the quantum numbers\nof the transition (total recombining ion electronic angular momentum Jc and highly-excited electron quantum numbers before\nand after the transition n, l, K, n\u2032 , l\u2032 , K \u2032 ), Column 8 gives the\nline component wavelength in microns, next columns in pairs\nstate line component emissivity in cm3 /s and intensity ratio of\nthis component with respect to the K- and l-summed emissivity\n\u03b5(Jc , nlK, n\u2032 l\u2032 K \u2032 )/\u03b5(n, n\u2032). Only the lines most likely to be detected are given in these tables, selected by the following parameters \u2013 only \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 lines having wavelengths between 0.3 and\n5.0 \u03bcm.\nTables 16\u201323, also available at the CDS, contain similar information on predicted oxygen line component fluxes in the\nSD95 200 km/s shock model. The fluxes from the cooling and\nphotoionized regions are given separately in Tables 16\u201320 (for\nO ii \u2013 O vi) and 21\u201323 (for O ii \u2013 O iv), respectively. First eight\ncolumns again contain the quantum numbers characterizing the\ntransition and the line wavelength, Column 9 lists line component flux in erg/cm2/s, Column 10 contains intensity ratio of this\ncomponent with respect to the K- and l-summed emissivity.\nAs discussed in Appendix B.4, the input atomic data are precise to about 10% and we cannot expect better precision of the\nresulting line wavelength differences from the hydrogenic values.\nSample region from the total resulting model spectrum is\nshown on Figure 9. It shows variety of the spectral shapes as\nwell as illustrates the diminishing of the peak intensity due to\nK-splitting for O iii lines.\nThe line substructure change with density and temperature\nbecause of changes in the relative populations of the l-states. At\nlow temperatures the main population mechanism is the radiative\nrecombination, which is populating high-l levels relatively efficient. When the electron density increases, l-redistribution modifies high-l populations for n greater than about 20, but for n < 15\nthe changes are generally smaller.\nAt higher temperatures, DR populates relatively lower l\nstates having higher quantum defects and low probabilities of \u03b1line emission. Therefore a recombination line is split into many\ncomponents and its emissivity is relatively low. In this case, lredistribution mostly shift the recombined electrons to higher-l\nstates, simplifying the line profile and significantly increasing its\nemissivity.\n\n\fD. Docenko and R.A.

Plasma diagnostics using recombination lines\n5.1. Temperature diagnostics\n\nLine emissivity dependence on temperature is shown for several\nbright optical and near-infrared oxygen recombination lines in\nthe low-density limit on Figure 11. Corresponding line wavelengths are given in Table 2 above. This figure allows to compute the recombination line fluxes for other models of the multitemperature plasma with emission measure distribution different\nfrom the discussed SD95 model.\n\nThe curves on Figure 11 has two distinct regions. At low\ntemperatures the emissivity is determined by the radiative recombination and changes smoothly from ion to ion. At temperatures higher than several tens of thousands Kelvin the dielectronic recombination starts to dominate the recombination\nrates (except for the O vi lines due to absence at low temperatures of dielectronic recombination channels in He-like ion\nO6+ ) and line emissivities of different ions start being determined by the lowest excited states of the recombining ion, as\ndescribed in Appendix B.2. The temperature of the strong emissivity rise is proportional to the typical energy of such excited\nstates. Amplitude of the rise is proportional to the lowest excited\nstate decay rate.\nFor the discussed SD95 200 km/s shock model the hightemperature region where the DR dominates is important only\nfor O v lines, but it is easy to imagine other ionic abundance distributions where it will affect also ions in lower ionization stages.\nDependence of individual O v recombination \u03b1-line ratios on\ntemperature is shown on Figure 12. Again, the two distinct regions are seen at low and high temperatures corresponding to\nRR- and DR-dominated recombination.\n\n\f10\n\nD. Docenko and R.A.

Low-density l-summed emissivities of oxygen ion optical and near-infrared recombination lines. Different colors represent different ions, plotted line thickness increase with the spectral line wavelength.\nIt is easy to notice that in the intermediate temperatures, the\nlines corresponding to transitions at lowest n's become relatively\nbrighter. Reason for such dependence, especially clearly visible on the 6\u03b1/7\u03b1 line ratio, is the following. As follows from\nAppendix B.2, at low temperatures the dielectronic recombination rate is damped by the factor exp (\u2212E/kT e ). For the low nlevels the doubly excited state energy E may be significantly\nlower than the core excitation energy and at low temperatures\nthis makes a difference and the dielectronic recombination populates mostly low-n levels, increasing emissivities of low-n recombination lines.\nThe described effect is most pronounced for recombination lines of O v, Si iii and S v, although in all cases the most\ntemperature-sensitive line \u2013 the \u03b1-line formed by the transition\nfrom the lowest level, onto which DR is possible \u2013 is situated\naround 2000\u20133000 \u00c5. Though, as can be seen from Figure 12,\nalso the next line situated for these ions around 4500\u20135000 \u00c5,\ncan also be a useful diagnostical tool, being relatively much\nbrighter in a narrow temperature interval.\n\n5.2. Recombination lines as density diagnostics\n\nRecombination line flux ratios allow in principle to determine\nalso density of the emitting region, as their dependences on density and temperature differently affect the relative line fluxes.\nAs an example, on Figure 13 we plot the O v 7\u03b1 line emissivity as function of the electron density for different temperatures\nbetween 103 and 105 K. For better representation, emissivity ratios to their low-density values are shown. Clearly, the density\ndependences are weak and can probably be neglected in the first\nstage of the qualitative analysis, especially at low temperatures.\nTwo distinct regions are seen once again. At low temperatures where only radiative recombination determines the level\npopulations, emissivities decrease with density, but at higher\ntemperatures they increase. The difference is explained by different initial populations of the levels.\n\n\fD. Docenko and R.A.

Dependence of O v 7\u03b1 line emissivity on electron density for different electron temperatures T e . Values are normalized\nto the low-density emissivity.\n\nDielectronic recombination predominantly populates states\nwith l <\n\u223c 10 (see, e.g., Appendix B.2). Collisions in this case\nmostly transfer recombined electrons to higher l's, increasing the\nprobability of \u2206n = 1 transitions and, therefore, \u03b1-line emissivities.\nRadiative recombination, especially at low temperatures,\npopulates high-l states much more efficiently. In this case, populations of low-l levels relatively increase as a result of the lchanging collisions, and recombination line emissivities somewhat decrease.\nOn Figure 14 we show the O v recombination line emissivities relative to their low-density values as functions of electron density at temperature 30 000 K. Lines arising in transitions\nbetween higher levels increase relatively more, but in absolute\nterms the increase in emissivity is approximately constant, determined by the l-redistribution on the high-n levels.\n\nOur previous analysis mainly concerned the oxygen recombination line emission, as the SD95 model allows making quantitative predictions about their fluxes and line ratios to the observed collisionally-excited lines. For other elements, no model\nresults for ionic abundance distribution are available. Thus to\npredict their line fluxes it is necessary to solve a separate problem of non-equilibrium plasma cooling and recombination after\nthe shock front for dense clouds of different compositions. Such\nanalysis is outside the scope of this paper.\nNevertheless, it seems valuable to provide data on the recombination line emissivities as functions of temperature for the\nmost typical elements. Then, from measured line ratios, it will be\npossible to reconstruct characteristic conditions in the emitting\nregions. As two most typical examples for elements composing\nFMKs in Cas A, we concentrate on the recombination lines of\nsilicon and sulphur. Approximate wavelengths of their recombination lines are given in Table 2 above.\nFigure 15 presents low-density emissivities of brightest optical and near-infrared recombination lines of silicon and sulphur ions, expected to exist in the fast-moving knots. Note that\nSi iv and S vi lines are much weaker than of the other ions at\nT e > 104 K due to weakness of dielectronic recombination channels at these temperatures. Note also that the line emissivities\nin Si ii and Si iii ions start to increase sharply already at about\n12 000 K.\nThus these ions are the most sensitive tracers of plasma at\ntemperatures between 15 000 and 30 000 K, when emissivities\nof O and S ions are yet relatively weak. This is also seen on\nFigure 8(b,c) above, where the emissivities of the lines of Si iii\nare a factor of 20-50 higher than that of O iii and S iii in the same\nconditions.\nResembling the case of oxygen recombination lines, the density dependences are not pronounced.\n5.4.

Low-density l-summed emissivities of several optical and near-infrared silicon and sulphur recombination lines.\nDifferent colors represent different ions, plotted line thickness\nincrease with spectral line wavelength.\n\nAs these two types of lines have different origin, their emissivity dependences on temperature and density are rather different. For example, collisionally-excited line emissivities exponentially drop at temperatures below about h\u03bd/k, as thermal electron energies are not sufficient to excite the ion electronic transition. In contrast, recombination line emissivities at low temperatures increase with the temperature decreasing.\nAlso a useful property is that, even in the case when the recombination lines are not detected at all, from the limits on the\nratios to the collisional lines it is possible to put constraints on\nthe plasma parameters.\nOn the Figure 16 we give ratios to several brightest\ncollisionally-excited optical lines. The exponential increase\nof ratios at low temperatures is clearly seen. Collisional\nline emissivities have been computed using Chianti atomic\ndatabase (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2006)\nRatios to the fine-structure far-infrared line emissivities are\ngiven on Figure 17. As the Chianti database does not allow to\ncompute line emissivities down to 100 K, we computed them by\nextrapolating fine-structure transition electronic excitation collision strengths to low temperatures by a constant, that should\nbe reliable to within a factor of two. The collision strength values were adopted from calculations by Lennon & Burke (1994);\n\nBlum & Pradhan (1992); Tayal & Gupta (1999); Tayal (2000,\n2006).\nWe note that observations of the far-infrared lines in the\nspectral range from 10 to 100 \u03bcm are impossible from the\nground. But even from space, observations of these very intense\nlines cannot be performed with angular resolution sufficient for\nresolving individual knots. They can result only in signal integrated over many individual emitting objects.\nDensity dependences of recombination and collisionallyexcited lines are also different. Forbidden line emissivity starts\ndecreasing as 1/ne at some critical density, whereas the recombination line emissivities may both decrease and increase depending on the plasma temperature (see above).\nThe best density indicators for relatively low temperatures\nand densities in the fast-moving knots are obviously ratios of\ndifferent optical and near-infrared line to the far-infrared lines\nthat have critical densities of the order of 100 \u2212 104 cm\u22123 . In\nthe accompanying paper (Docenko & Sunyaev, to be submitted),\nwe present such analysis based on existing experimental data\nand compare the results with our predictions based on the SD95\nmodel.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have offered and developed in detail a new method of rapidly\nrecombining plasma diagnostics based on measurements of optical and near-infrared recombination lines of multiply-ionized\nmetal atoms.\nAs a promising example, we have applied our method to the\nSD95 theoretical model of fast-moving knots in Cassiopeia A\nsupernova remnant and computed expected oxygen line fluxes\nfrom a single FMK of average size and resulting recombination\nline ratios. It turned out that both cold photoionized region before the shock front and rapidly cooling region immediately after the shock front produce oxygen recombination lines strong\nenough to be observed on modern optical telescopes in the wavelength range between 0.5 and 3 \u03bcm.\nAt shorter wavelengths, two reasons hamper the line observations: high absorption in the interstellar medium on the way\nfrom Cas A and the line splitting into widely separated multiple\ncomponents with consequently lower intensities in each of them.\nThe lines n\u03b1 corresponding to transitions between n \u2265 6 levels\n\n\fRecombination line to collisional line ratio\n\nD.

Emissivity ratios of recombination lines to several farinfrared collisionally-excited lines. Upper and lower panels\nshow emissivity ratios in the low-density limit applicable for the\ncold photoionized region (except for the 88.4 \u03bcm line) and the\ncase of ne = 3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 typical for the cooling region after the\nshock front.\n\nare the most promising, as they are not so strongly split and have\n50-90% of intensity in one or a few narrow components.\nThe precision of our RL flux estimates from the Cas A is not\nexpected to be better than a factor of several, as inconsistencies\nof similar magnitude are observed between the SD95 model predictions and far-infrared oxygen line observations (Docenko &\nSunyaev, to be submitted).\nNevertheless, when detected, the recombination lines will\nallow to determine the details of the photoionization and rapid\ncooling processes in the FMKs from the line intensities, intensity ratios to each other and to forbidden collisionally-excited\nlines and from the recombination line fine structure measurements. The measurements of the line structure demand higher\nsignal-to-noise ratios that can nevertheless be achieved on modern telescopes in a reasonable integration time of few hours.\nOne very interesting result is that the predicted O v and O vi\nrecombination lines, being brightest in the cooling region recombination line spectra, arise in the temperature range significantly\nbelow 105 K, where there is essentially no O5+ and O6+ ions in\nthe collisional ionization equilibrium conditions.\nIt would be also very interesting to observe the recombination lines from the knots consisting mostly of silicon and sul-\n\nTraditionally, the highly-excited level populations are characterized by the so-called departure coefficients bnl , defined as the\nratio of actual level population Nnl to its thermodynamic equilibrium value Nnl\u2217 . With n increasing, at levels n > n1 the collisional\nl-redistribution processes establish equilibrium population over\nl's, i.e., bn = bnl . The value of n1 depends on the ion, as well as\non electron temperature and number density.\nFor higher n's, rates of collisional transitions involving n\nchange start rapidly increasing and from some n > n2 determine the highly-excited level populations. Thus the bn curve,\nitself defined only at n > n1 , has two distinct ranges as a function of n: below n = n2 it is determined by recombination and\nradiative processes and above it rapidly tends to unity because\nof the processes relating different n level populations with each\nother and with the continuum: collisional n-redistribution, threebody recombination and collisional ionization. As an example\nrelevant for our study, bn 's of Li-like ion O5+ at temperatures\n1000 and 20 000 K and electron density 50 000 cm\u22123 are shown\non Figure A.1, assuming bn = bnl .\nOn this figure, we also show the departure coefficients, computed accounting only for radiative n \u2192 n\u2032 transitions. It is seen\nthat such approximation results in population computation errors\nat levels higher than about n2 .\nLet us now show that the electrons that recombined to levels\nn > n2 are contributing relatively weakly to the total recombination and it is safe to introduce an upper cutoff nmax , neglecting\npopulation of higher levels. Two cases \u2013 bn2 > 1 and bn2 < 1 \u2013\nshould be discussed separately here.\nIn case of bn2 > 1 not introducing such cutoff and neglecting\nn \u2192 n\u2032 collisions may result in some cases in significant overestimate of the recombination rate \u2013 up to a factor of several. The\neasiest estimate of the cutoff position is the level where the total\nrecombination rate onto n < nmax computed without accounting\nfor n \u2192 n\u2032 transitions equals to the true total recombination rate.\nIt is easy to understand that in this case nmax \u2248 n2 , as illustrated\nin the lower panel of Figure A.2.\nIn case of bn2 < 1 the rates obtained neglecting collisional transitions between high levels will always underestimate\ntrue recombination rates. Though for temperatures above about\n103 K taking upper cutoff value approximately equal to n2 does\nnot result in error more than about 20% for relevant ions, as illustrated on the upper panel of the Figure A.2. Lower cutoff values\nwill result in more significant underestimates of the total recombination rate and the line emissivities.\n\n\f15\n-14\n\n10\n\n10\n\nq (n)\nq (<n)\n\n5\n\n-15\n\n10\n\n500\n\nFig. A.1.

In the radiative recombination process, a free electron is directly recombining to a bound\nstate (nl). A photon is simultaneously emitted, carrying away the\nreleased energy.\nThe radiative recombination level-specific cross sections\n\u03c3RR were computed from hydrogenic photoionization cross sections \u03c3PI by applying the detailed balance relation:\n\u03c3RR (E \u2192 nl) =\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03b12 Z 2 2l + 1\n\u03c3PI (nl \u2192 E),\n2\nn2 \u03bdn (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdn )\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere E is the electron energy prior to recombination, h\u03bdn =\nRy Z 2 /n2 is the level binding energy, h\u03bd = E + h\u03bdn is the energy\nof emitted photon, Z is the recombining ion charge and \u03b1 is the\nfine-structure constant. The photoionization cross sections \u03c3PI\nwere calculated by the computer program of Storey & Hummer\n(1991).\nThe\nlevel-specific\nradiative\nrecombination rates\nqRR (nl; T e ) \u2261 h\u03c3RR (E \u2192 nl) * \u03c5(E)i were then computed\nby numerical integration over the electron Maxwellian energy\ndistribution for the temperature T e (here \u03c5 denote electron\nvelocity).\nUsing expressions from e.g. Spitzer (1956), it may be shown\nthat the electron-electron collision timescale \u03c4eec is always\nshorter than the cooling time \u03c4cool at temperatures below 105 K\n\nFig. A.2.

Dielectronic recombination\n\nThe DR is a two-step process (for reviews see, e.g.,\nBeigman et al. (1968); Shore (1969); Seaton & Storey (1976);\nSobelman et al. (1981)), illustrated in the simplest case by the\nfollowing diagram:\nX Z+ (\u03b30 ) + e \u21c4 X (Z\u22121)+ (\u03b3, nl) \u2192 X (Z\u22121)+ (\u03b30 , nl) + photon. (B.2)\nFree electron e is first resonantly captured by the ion X Z+\n(Z denotes the ion charge) with simultaneous core electron excitation from the ground state \u03b30 to the state \u03b3 having excitation\nenergy Ec . This process is called dielectronic capture. Resulting\n\n\fD. Docenko and R.A.

In the first method, the autoionization rate is expressed in terms of the photoionization cross section using the\ndipole approximation for the inter-electronic interaction. Simple\nexpression of this cross section and the autoionization rate in\nthe n \u226b 1 limit is then obtained using quasi-classical (QC) approach (Bureyeva & Lisitsa 2000).\nIt is known that the dipole approximation is not applicable\nfor this purpose for l \u2264 3 states (Beigman et al. 1981). Though,\nthis is not a serious limitation in the case, when the dielectronic\ncapture occurs via excitation of the recombining ion core electron without change of its principal quantum number (\u2206nc = 0).\nSuch transitions are the most important in our case, as relevant\nplasma temperatures are much lower than the \u2206nc > 0 transition\nexcitation energies.\nThe second method is based on the usage of the program\nATOM (Shevelko & Vainshtein 1993). It computes autoionization rates by extrapolating below the threshold the electronic excitation cross section of the recombining ion core transition. This\nextrapolation method is based on the correspondence principle\nand is thus precise in the limit of n \u226b 1. Both in QC approximation and ATOM approach, the autoionization rates decrease\nas n\u22123 .\nComparison plots of the DR rates of O5+ forming O4+ with\nrecombined electron populating all n-levels and n = 20 level lstates are given on Figure B.1. It is seen that in the quasiclassical\napproximation, electrons are populating lower l's, but higher n's.\nAs can be inferred from Eq. (B.3), this corresponds to sharper ldependence of the autoionization rates. Comparison of scaled\nquasiclassical and quantum autoionization rates Aa (2p, nl; 2s) \u00d7\nn3 of doubly-excited oxygen ion O4+ is shown on Figure B.2,\nindeed showing the inferred dependence.\nIt is clear from these data that the two models for the\nDR rates will result in significantly different line emissivities (see also Figure 1). For final results we decided to use\nthe ATOM rates, where available, as the theoretical arguments (Shevelko & Vainshtein 1993) show that they are more\nprecise than the quasiclassical ones.\nFor ions O5+ , O4+ , Si4+ , Si3+ , Si2+ , S6+ , S5+ and S4+ we\nused the ATOM rates. For other ions we implemented the quasiclassical expressions.\nComparison of the dielectronic recombination rates with\nother atomic process rates is shown on Figure B.3 for the case of\nO4+ ion with highly-excited electron on levels n = 50 and 200.\n\n5\n\nDR rate, cm /s\n\nion having two excited electrons is unstable with respect to autoionization \u2013 the inverse process of the dielectronic capture.\nThe recombined ion then either autoionizes, or its excited\ncore electron transits back to the ground state \u03b30 and emits a\nresonant line photon, thus making the ion stable against the autoionization.\nTherefore the level-specific dielectronic recombination rate\nqDR (\u03b3, nl; T e ) is a product of two factors: dielectronic capture\nrate and doubly-excited state stabilization probability. In the simple case described above it is expressed as\n\u0010 2 \u00113/2 g\u03b3 (2l+1) A A (\u03b3,nl;\u03b3 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\u03c0~\nE\nc a\n0\nqDR (\u03b3, nl; T e ) = mkT\nexp\n\u2212\n, (B.3)\ng\nA\n+A\n(\u03b3,nl;\u03b3\n)\nkT\ne\n0\nc\na\n0\ne\n\n15\n\n-13\n\n10\n\nRatio ATOM / QC\n0.8\n10\n\n100\n\n-14\n\n10\n\nATOM results\nQC approximation\n10\n\n100\nPrincipal quantum number n\n\nFig. B.1. Comparison of l-resolved (upper panel) and l-summed\n(lower panel) O5+ ion dielectronic recombination rates computed by the two methods described in the text: ATOM program\nand quasiclassical (QC) approximation. The values are given for\nT e = 2 \u00d7 104 K, but the curves scale identically with the temperature as long as T e \u226a 106 K, when \u2206nc > 0 core excitations start\nplaying a role. The l-resolved rates are given for n = 20.\n\nIt is seen that the dielectronic recombination populates lower l's,\nbut is more efficient at high-n levels. In case of sufficiently high\ndensity the dielectronic recombination to low-l states is followed\nby rapid redistribution onto much higher l's resulting in enhancement of the recombination line intensities.\nB.3. Highly-excited level energies\n\nIn hydrogen atom the energies of (nl) levels are independent on\nl because of the shape of the Coulomb potential. In atoms with\nseveral electrons the changes in the potential energy curve introduce variations of the highly-excited level energies E(nl) with l.\nThis dependence is usually parametrized by expression\nE(nl) = Ry\n\nz2\n,\n(n \u2212 \u03bcnl )2\n\nwhere \u03bcnl denotes quantum defect of the level (nl) and z = Z + 1\nis the ion spectroscopic symbol. The quantum defects \u03bcnl rapidly\ndecrease with increasing l and tend to constant with increasing n\n(Seaton 1983).\n\n\f16\n\nD. Docenko and R.A.

Small wavelength differences are in this case determined by the energy differences within n and n\u2032 groups of\nstates \u2013 by the quantum defects of the levels.\nSecondly, the collisional transition rates Cnl,nl\u2032 are dependent\non the energy level splitting |E(nl)\u2212E(nl\u2032)|, growing as this splitting decreases. Therefore the quantum defects in this case determine rates of l-redistribution and recombination line flux dependence on electron density in plasma.\nIn case of l \u2264 2 the quantum defects for most ions are known\nand have been taken for our study from Ralchenko et al. (2007)5 .\nIn the next subsection we describe our method of computation of\nlevel energy shift from hydrogenic values EH (nl) = Ry z2 /n2 for\nl > 2 that can be expressed via quantum defects as\n\u2206E(nl) \u2261 E(nl) \u2212 EH (nl) \u2248 2Ry\n\nz2\n\u03bcl ,\nn3\n\nwhere we have assumed that \u03bcnl = \u03bcl , i.e. that the quantum defect\ndoes not depend on n and that it is small: \u03bcl \u226a 1.\nThe latter assumption is valid in our case of l \u226b 1, when\nthe (nl) states are \"non-penetrating\", i.e., those in which highlyexcited electron wave function significantly differs from zero\nonly outside the atomic core region. This property also allows\nto use hydrogenic expressions for description of such highlyexcited states.\n\n3\n\n-1\n\nCollisional and decay rates, s\n\n10\n\nDR and RR rates, cm /s\n\n3\n\nDR rate, cm /s\n3\nRR rate, cm /s\n-1\nDecay rate, s\n-1\nCollisional rate, s\n\n5\n\nD E\nrc2\n4.33\n3.79\n\n6\n\nFig. B.2.

Computation of the level shifts for high-l states\n\nFollowing the approach of Watson et al. (1980) and Dickinson\n(1981), we account for the non-penetrating (nl) state level shifts\narising due to two effects: core polarizability and electrostatic\nquadrupole interaction with the core.\nThe energy shift induced by the core polarizability\nD isE pro\u22124\nportional to the highly-excited electron radial integral rnl\nand,\nexpressing it with hydrogenic formula, equals (Seaton 1983)\n\u2206Ep (nl) =\n\n\u03b1c z4\n2(3 \u2212 l(l + 1)/n2 )\nRy.\na30 n3 l(l + 1)(2l \u2212 1)(2l + 1)(2l + 3)\n\n(B.4)\n\nHere a0 is the Bohr radius and \u03b1c is the core polarizability, taken\nfor relevant ions from the handbook of Fraga et al.

If Jc \u2265 1, the highly-excited electron interacts with it, splitting the (nl) level into 2Jc + 1 components numbered by the quantum number K, where K = J c + l.\nNormally, if the K-splitting is present, it is larger than the level\nshift due to core polarizability (Lundeen 2005).\nThe quadrupole shift in this case is given by the expression (Chang 1984):\n(\n)\nJc Jc 2\nl+Lc +S c +K\n\u2206Eq (nl, K) = (\u22121)\n(2Jc + 1)\n\u00d7\nLc Lc S c\n)\n(\n(B.5)\nE\nD\nE\nD\nJ J 2\n\u22123\n2Ry,\n(l||C (2) ||l) (Lc ||C (2) ||Lc ) rc2 rnl\n\u00d7 c c\nl l K\nwhere S cD isEthe total\nD core\nE spin momentum, {: : :} denote a 6 j\u22123\nare radial integrals in atomic units for\nsymbol, rc2 and rnl\ncore and highly-excited electron, respectively, and (l||C (2) ||l)'s\nare reduced matrix elements, given explicitly, e.g., by Sobelman\n(1979):\ns\nl(l + 1)(2l + 1)\n(2)\n(l||C ||l) = \u2212\n.\n(2l + 3)(2l \u2212 1)\n\nThe highly-excited electron radial integral can be determined using hydrogenic expression\nD E from, e.g., Bethe & Salpeter\n(1957). Core radial integrals rc2 were computed for all relevant ions using radial wave functions produced by the Flexible\nAtomic\nCode (FAC, Gu (2003)). Where literature data for the\nD E\nrc2 were available (Sen 1979), the differences between them\nand the FAC\ndid not exceed about 10-15%. The used valD values\nE\nues of the rc2 are given in Table B.1.\nExpression (B.5) may be approximated in case of P core\nstates (Lc = 1) and l \u226b 1 by\nD ED E\n\u22123\nRy\n\u2206Eq, max (nl) \u2248 0.2 rc2 rnl\nD E\nz3 rc2\nRy,\n(B.6)\n= 0.2 3\nn l(l + 1)(l + 1/2)\nwhere in this case \u2206Eq, max (nl) gives maximum shift of all\nthe K-components. Components with both \u2206Eq, max (nl) and\n\u2212\u2206Eq, max (nl) shifts are sometimes present.\nTaking into account these effects, the total (nl) state shift for\nestimate of the collisional l-redistribution rates was taken to be\nmaximum possible, i.e.,\n\u2206E(nl) = \u2206Eq, max (nl) + \u2206Ep (nl) .\nAs larger shifts correspond to smaller collisional cross sections,\nour approach may somewhat underestimate the l-redistribution\nrates.\nWe estimate that the resulting uncertainties of level splittings, in case of the K-splitting present, correspond to the uncertainties in the electron density determination from the line ratios\n(see Section 5.2) being within a factor of about two.\nB.5. Computation of the line substructure\n\nAs\nD Ethe ions of different elements have different values of \u03b1c and\nrc2 , the recombination line exact wavelengths will depend not\nonly on the ionic charge and the principal quantum numbers of\nthe transition, but also on the element and the quantum numbers\nl, l\u2032 , K and K \u2032 .\nFrom the above expressions determining energy levels shifts\nit is possible to calculate the positions of all line nl \u2192 n\u2032 l\u2032 components nlK \u2192 n\u2032 l\u2032 K \u2032 . Their relative fluxes are determined by\n\n17\n\nthe so-called line strengths S according to expression (Chang\n1984)\n( \u2032\n)2\nK K 1\n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\nS (nlK, n l K ) \u221d (2K + 1)(2K + 1)\n,\n(B.7)\nl l\u2032 Jc\n\nif we assume that populations of the (nlK)-states are proportional\nto their statistical weights equal to (2K + 1).\nIt was shown by Chang (1984) that l = 3 levels in Si i are still\npartially penetrating the core. Therefore also in our case the Si\nand S line substructure is described adequately only for l > 3. In\nour paper we give results also for l = 3, but the precision of line\nposition predictions in this case is expected to be rather limited.\nIn the post-shock plasma of the fast moving knots, the density is high enough to establish significant population of lowest\nexcited fine-structure sublevels (Smeding & Pottasch 1979) that\nhave typical excitation energies corresponding to temperatures\nof several hundred Kelvin.\nIn some cases such excited state populations strongly change\nthe line substructure. For example, in O3+ ion, the ground state\n2\nP1/2 has Jc = 1/2 and quadrupole interaction with it is absent.\nThough, the lowest excited state 2 P3/2 of this ion has Jc = 3/2. In\ncase the core electron is in the excited state prior to recombination, or getting there after the DR process, the highly-excited levels will have K-splitting and resulting recombination lines will\nhave much richer substructure.\nIn our analysis we assume populations of the Jc sublevels\nproportional to their statistical weights.\nB.6. Line emission without recombination\n\nWe also account for the following process, mostly not resulting\nin a recombination, but contributing, sometimes noticeably, to\nthe spectral line emissivities:\nX Z+ (\u03b30 ) + e \u21c4 X (Z\u22121)+ (\u03b3, nl) \u2192\n\u2192 X (Z\u22121)+ (\u03b3, n\u2032 l\u2032 ) + photon \u2192\nZ+\n\n(B.8)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2192 X (\u03b30 ) + e + photon,\ni.e., highly-excited electron transition instead of core transition,\nfollowed by the captured electron autoionization. This process\nmay be quite efficient for increasing \u2206n = 1 transition emissivities, as the radiative transition rates for captured electron may\nbe significantly higher than that of the core electron, if the core\ntransition rate is low.\nThis is exactly the case for \u2206nc = 0 transitions, mostly contributing to the DR at relatively low temperatures. Rate of the described process (\"dielectronic capture with line emission\", DCL)\nforming a line from transition (nl) \u2192 (n\u2032 l\u2032 ) may be easily expressed via the rate of the dielectronic recombination as\nAnl,n\u2032 l\u2032\nqDCL (\u03b3, nl, n\u2032l\u2032 ; T e ) = qDR (\u03b3, nl; T e )\n.\n(B.9)\nAc\nAs the autoionization rates are much higher than the radiative\ntransition rates within the ion, probability of the DCL is small\nand after the first captured electron transition it autoionizes, if it\nis energetically allowed.\nTo produce noticeable effect, highly-excited electron transition rates should be at least comparable to the core transition\nrates, as DCL does not produce cascades. Therefore, only transitions between lower n's contribute significantly to the additional\nemission in lines. In case of O5+ , described process increases the\nDR contribution to the recombination line emissivity by roughly\n5% for the 8\u03b1 and 7\u03b1 lines. From Eq. (B.9) it is clear that this\nfraction does not depend on temperature.\n\n\f18\n\nD. Docenko and R.A. Sunyaev: Optical and NIR recombination lines from Cas A knots\n\nB.7. Estimates of the resulting uncertainties\n\nGiven the amount of approximations made to achieve the final\nresults \u2013 the metal recombination line emissivities and wavelengths \u2013 it might be useful to state explicitly resulting uncertainties of these quantities.\nThe least reliable components for calculation of the recombination line emissivities are dielectronic recombination rates and\nupper cutoff position.\nFor the ions where the ATOM results are available, the lowdensity emissivity and flux uncertainties are expected to be about\n10%. For the ions where the calculations are made using the quasiclassical expressions, the precision is lower and may constitute\nup to 50%.\nThe choice of the upper cutoff nmax position results in additional emissivity uncertainty of less than 10% for the DRdominated recombinations and emissivity underestimate of less\nthan 20% for the RR-dominated case.\nThe density dependences of the line emissivities are not\nstrong and should be quite reliably modeled with additional uncertainties being below 5\u201310%.\nIt should be reiterated that the absolute oxygen line fluxes are\nmuch less confidently predicted, as their values are based on the\ntheoretical FMK model that shows differences when compared\nto the observed optical-to-infrared collisional line ratios up to a\nfactor of several (Docenko & Sunyaev, to be submitted).\nThe line fine structure uncertainties are coming from the input atomic data (polarizabilities and radial integrals) limited precision. It is estimated to be not larger than 10\u201320%, thus the line\nfine structure should be quite reliable.\nThe recombination line fine structure component relative intensities are the least reliably predicted as they depend on the recombining ion ground state populations. The results given above\nassume equilibrium populations; this may not be true at low densities or temperatures. Therefore the observed line structure may\nbe significantly different from one expected. From another side,\nobserved line structure will allow to put additional constraints\non the electron density and temperature from the fine structure\ncomponent intensities.\n\nReferences\nBaade, W. & Minkowski, R. 1954, Astrophys.
