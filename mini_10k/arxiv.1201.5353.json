I show\nthat Einstein's field equations of November 25, 1915 with an additional term on the\nright hand side involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor appear to have\nsprung from his first November 1915 paper: the November 4, 1915 equations. Second\npaper among three papers.\n\n1 Introduction: David Hilbert Enters the Game, the priority dispute in a nutshell\nAccording to Stachel Einstein's Odyssey to general covariance during November\n1915 went through two stages:1\n1) Sometime in October 1915 Einstein dropped the Einstein-Grossman \"Entwurf\"\ntheory. During October 1915 Einstein realized that the key to the solution lays in\nequations (14) and (17) of page 1041 of his 1914 review article \"The Formal\nFoundation of the General Theory of Relativity\", and adopted the determinant in\nequation (14),\n\n1 as a postulate.2 This led him to general covariance. Starting\n\non November 4 Einstein gradually expanded the range of the covariance of his field\nequations.\n2) Between November 4 and November 11 Einstein realized that he did not need this\npostulate and he adopted it as a coordinate condition to simplify the field equations.\nEinstein was able to write the field equations of gravitation in a general covariant\nform. In the November 11 field equations the trace of the energy-momentum tensor\nvanishes. Between November 18 and November 25 Einstein found that he could write\nthe field equations with an additional term on the right hand side of the field equations\ninvolving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, which now need not vanish.\nThese were the November 25 field equations.\nLet us start with the first stage. During October 1915 Einstein presumably started with\npage 1041 of the 1914 paper, and then moved on to the next page 1042, and found a\nproblem with the \"fundamental tensor of RICCI and LEVI-CIVITA\", equation (19),\nwhich he did not use in his field equations of 1914.3 In his 1914 paper Einstein had to\n\n\f2\n\nmanipulate a derivation in order to demonstrate the tensorial character of\nproblem was the\n\nand the\n\nthe\n\nfactors that entered into equations (21) and (19), and\n\nthus led to Giklm \u2260 Giklm . 4 His field equations and generally the equations of his 1914\npaper made a distinction between tensors and what he called \"V-tensors\" (tensor\ndensities). The V-tensors were required because of the factors\n\nand\n\nwhich were not equal to 1. This complicated the equations of the Einstein-Grossmann\ntheory. By November 4, 1915 Einstein realized that when only substitutions of\ndeterminant 1 are permitted this simplified the equations as the above factor was\nomitted, and Giklm = Giklm.\nEinstein flipped a few extra pages of his 1914 paper, and arrived at page 1053. On\npage 1053 Einstein wrote the Riemann-Christoffel Tensor.5 In the first paper of\nNovember 4, 1915 Einstein wrote about the Ricci tensor Gim that the derivation of this\ntensor was better obtained from a different form of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor\n(ik, lm). In a footnote Einstein explained that he had given this proof already in his\n1914 paper on page 1053.6 Einstein defined the second term in equation (13), Rim, like\nhe had done three years earlier on page 22R of the Zurich Notebook. 7 According to\nthe footnote, page 1053 of the 1914 paper was very likely a trigger for Einstein to\ncome back to his calculations from three years earlier.\nEinstein started to write the November 4 paper and adopted the postulate that his field\nequations were covariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of a determinant\nequal to 1. 8\nWhile he was writing the November 4 paper, Einstein realized that by contracting the\nRicci tensor one would arrive at a scalar equation [(21a)] that implied that it was\nimpossible to choose a coordinate system in which\n\n. If we choose such a\n\ncoordinate system, then log 1 = 0 and the scalar of the energy tensor\n\nis set to\n\nzero.9 Nevertheless, Einstein published this result in the November 4 paper and\nmentioned the problem with this result.\nRenn and Stachel explain that, \"the physical meaning of condition\" (21a) \"was\nentirely obscure. It was therefore incumbent upon Einstein to find a physical\ninterpretation of it or to modify his theory once more in order to get rid of it. He soon\nsucceeded in doing both, and formulated his new view in an addendum to the first\nnote, published on November 11\".10\n\n\f3\n\nOn November 7, 1915, Einstein sent David Hilbert the proofs to his first paper of\nNovember 4, and he wanted Hilbert to look at this work. Hilbert also read Einstein's\n1914 paper, and found some mistake in this paper; Einstein wrote that his colleague\nSommerfeld wrote him that Hilbert had objected to the 1914 \"Entwurf\" foundations\npaper. 11 The mistake is discussed later.\nBy November 10, 1915 Hilbert probably answered Einstein's letter, telling him about\nhis system of electromagnetic theory of matter, the unified theory of gravitation and\nelectromagnetism, in which the source of the gravitational field is the electromagnetic\nfield. Hilbert goal was to develop an electromagnetic theory of matter, which would\nexplain the stability of the electron.12\nBetween November 4 and November 11 it seems that Einstein was influence by\nHilbert's physical attitude towards a field theory of matter. In his addendum to the\nfirst note, published on November 11 Einstein directly referred to the supporters of\nthe electrodynamic worldview, \"One now has to remember that, in accord with our\nknowledge, 'matter' is not to be conceived as something primitively given, or\nphysically simple. There even are those, and not just a few, who hope to be able to\nreduce matter to purely electrodynamic processes, which of course would have to be\ndone in a theory more complete than Maxwell's electrodynamics\". Einstein probably\ndiscussed the electrodynamic worldview with Hilbert and felt that he was now in\ncompetition with the latter.13\nIn the addendum to the November 4 paper, the November 11 paper, Einstein added\nthe following coordinate condition: \"we assume in the following that the condition\nis in general actually fulfilled \".14 This allowed Einstein to take the last\nstep and to write the field equations of gravitation in a general covariant form.15 He\nthen dropped his November 4 postulate and adopted it as a coordinate condition,\n\nThe day afterwards Einstein wrote Hilbert again. 16 He told him about the progress in\nhis work. Hilbert replied and invited Einstein to come to G\u00f6ttingen. 17 Hilbert\nexplained to Einstein the main points of his new unified theory of gravitation and\nelectromagnetism, and told Einstein that he had already discussed his discovery with\nSommerfeld. He wanted next to explain it to Einstein. He thus invited him to come to\nhear his talk on November 16. Hilbert told Einstein that the latter's November 4 paper\nwas entirely different from his own work.\nWith hindsight Hilbert's work was different from Einstein's November 4 paper in that,\nHilbert eventually endeavored to derive generally covariant field equations for the\ncombined gravitational and electromagnetic fields without explicitly writing down\n\n\f4\n\nthese equations. Hilbert accepted Einstein's 1914 Hole Argument against general\ncovariance (after Einstein had silently dropped it). Hilbert was thus finally obliged to\nsupplement his generally covariant field equations by four non-generally covariant\nfield equations based on rather dubious energy considerations, which Hilbert would\neventually drop later when he would publish his paper (after Einstein presented his\nfinal form of field equations to the Prussian Academy on November 25).18\nEinstein replied and told Hilbert he could not come, but requested a copy of his\nwork.19 In response, Hilbert perhaps sent a copy of the lecture he had given on the\nsubject on November 16, or else a copy of a manuscript of the paper he would present\nfive days later on November 20 to the Royal Society in G\u00f6ttingen. 20\nEinstein was already less patient after he had received Hilbert's work. He replied to\nHilbert on November 18 telling him that his work agrees \u2013 as far as he could see \u2013\nexactly with what he had found in the last few weeks and have already presented to\nthe Prussian Academy.21 Einstein was in competition with Hilbert and appeared to\nhave been still influenced by his unified theory of matter, gravitation and\nelectromagnetism until November 18.22 Indeed on Thursday, November 18, Einstein\npresented to the Prussian Academy his solution to the longstanding problem of the\nprecession of the perihelion of Mercury, on the basis of his November 11 General\ntheory of relativity.\nThe day afterwards Hilbert sent a polite letter in which he congratulated Einstein on\novercoming the perihelion motion. He was quite astonished that Einstein calculated so\nrapidly the precession of Mercury's perihelion.23 In fact the basic calculation has\nalready been done two years earlier with Besso in the Einstein-Besso manuscript.\nEinstein transferred the basic framework of the calculation from the Einstein-Besso\nmanuscript, and corrected it according to his November field equations. 24\nIn the 1913 calculation of the Einstein-Besso manuscript, the gravitational field (of\nthe \"Entwurf\" theory) was represented by g\u03bc\u03bd, and the perihelion advance of Mercury\nwas calculated by first and second approximations of g\u03bc\u03bd. In 1915 the gravitational\nfield was represented by\n\n, and Einstein used the components\n\nof the\n\ngravitational field of the sun in order to find the perihelion advance of Mercury.25\nOn page 1 of the Einstein-Besso manuscript Einstein first took the 44 component of\nthe \"Entwurf\" field equation [\"Entwurf\" contravarient and covariant field equations\nrespectively, \u0394(\u03b3) = \u03c7(\u0398\u03bc\u03bd +\n), \u2212D\u03bc\u03bd(g) = \u03c7(t\u03bc\u03bd +T\u03bc\u03bd)]: 26\n,\n\n\f5\n\nwhere, \u0394 is the Laplacian, \u03ba is the gravitational constant: \u03ba = K(8\u03c0/c20), \u03c10 is the mass\ndensity of the sun, and c0 is the speed of light in vacuum.\nThe solution to this equation gives the contravariant metric field \u03b344 of the sun to first\norder:\n\nAnd the covariant metric field g44 of the sun to first order:\n.27\nNext, the first order solutions are substituted in the \"Entwurf\" equations and second\norder contributions are evaluated when one assumes that the field of the sun is\nspherically symmetric:\n,\n\n28\n\nThe next step is equations of motion (not yet geodesic equation) for a point mass\nmoving in the (weak-field) metric field of a static sun to second order (EulerLagrange equations for the action:\nS = \u222bH dt, with the Lagrangian H = \u2013 m ds/dt).29\nThe Hamiltonian for a unit mass-point in the field of a static sun is the following:\n\nBesso derived the angular momentum conservation, which he called \"the area law\"\n(Fl\u00e4chensatz):\n\nFrom this follows Kepler's second law. According to the \"Entwurf\" theory the relation\nbetween angular momentum conservation and Kepler's second law is more\ncomplicated. However, Besso still referred to the above equation as Kepler's law and\ncalled it \"the area law\".30 Besso then defined the \"Flachensatzkonstante\" Bc0, and\n\"Flachengeschwindigkeit\"\n\n\f6\n\n.31\nOn page 9 Besso wrote an equation expressing conservation of angular momentum\nand energy:\n\nInserting the metric field of a static sun to second order into the equation of\n\nand E\n\nabove, and after rearrangements and additional manipulations Besso finally arrived at\nan equation on the bottom of page 9:\n32\n\nTo find the advance of the perihelion, d\u03c6 has to be integrated between the values of r\nat perihelion and aphelion.33 After some calculations and rearrangements Besso\narrived at this result on page 14:\n\nwhere, a is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit.34\nFrom this equation it follows that according to the \"Entwurf\" theory the field of a\nstatic sun produces an advance of the perihelion of:\n\nper revolution.35\nIn November 1915 Einstein could calculate so rapidly the precession of Mercury's\nperihelion for another reason. Einstein's November 11 field equations for the metric\ntensor are the field equations for the gravitational field in the November 18 paper. The\ncondition\n\n, implied by the assumption of an electromagnetic origin of\n\nmatter, was essential for Einstein's calculation of the precession of Mercury's\nperihelion.36\nThe November 11 field equations are non-linear partial differential equations of the\nsecond rank, and there is no general solution to these equations. Solving the field\n\n\f7\n\nequations give the components of the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd. In his November 18 paper\nEinstein tried to find approximate solutions.\nEinstein was looking for the equation of a point moving along the geodesic line in the\ngravitational field of the sun. The solar system may be looked upon as an isolated\nmass, which is far away from other masses in the universe. Most of the mass of the\nsolar system is concentrated in the sun \u2013 more than 0.9998 of the total mass of the\nsolar system. One can treat the planets, the masses of which are negligible as\ncompared to the sun, as mass points moving in the static gravitational field of the sun.\nInside the solar system one can neglect the static gravitational potential of the planets\nand deal only with the gravitational potential of the sun.\nConsider a planet, a point with negligible mass, which moves in the static\ngravitational field of a body of spherical symmetry, in a great distance from this\ncentral mass. In a very great distance from this central mass the gravitational field is\nso weak until it is not felt and we arrive back at the Minkowski metric. These are the\nconditions that Einstein imposed on the gravitational field of the sun.\nThe point moves on a geodesic line under the influence of the gravitational field of\nthe sun, which is determined by the components of the metric tensor. The details of\nEinstein's scheme are discussed in the chapters below.\nEinstein calculated the equations of the geodesic lines in this space and compared\nthem with the Newtonian equations of the orbits of the planets in the solar system. He\nthus checked whether there is correspondence between general relativity and the\nNewtonian theory.\nIn Newtonian theory the gravitational attraction is a central force, and all planets\nmove in a constant plane around the sun. Hence in polar coordinates the motion of\nthis plane is dependent on the distance r of the planet from the center, and \u03c6 the angle\nbetween the line that connects the planet to the center and a line that is chosen\narbitrarily.\nOne can obtain the orbit equation, and one obtains r as a function of \u03c6 (the distance of\nthe planet from the sun at any given angle). The solution of the Newtonian orbit\nequation is the equation of an ellipse \u2013 an orbit in the plane, and the eccentricity e\ndetermines the characteristic of the elliptic orbit.\nThe perihelion of the orbit is the point in which the planet is closest to the sun. This\npoint is found on the major axis of the ellipse, its longest diameter, the line that runs\nthrough the centre and both its foci. This major axis was found to slowly turn around\nthe sun; and the Perihelion turned as well. This is the precession of the perihelion, and\nit is more pronounced the more the eccentricity e is larger.\n\n\f8\n\nIn Einstein's theory the geodesic equation leads to an orbit equation. The geodesic\nequation led Einstein to a relativistic equation of the orbit [equation (11)].37 Einstein\nfound that the difference between the Newtonian orbit equation and the relativistic\norbit equation was in an additional term: 2GM/c2r3 that appears in the relativistic\nequation.\nHe thus treated first the Newtonian solution to this equation as a first approximation.\nHe then checked, what was the size of the correction that resulted from the addition of\nthis term? He integrated the Newtonian orbit equation first.\nThe Newtonian solution to the Newtonian orbit equation describes the following: an\nellipse of a planet, for which the direction of the major axis and the perihelion should\nboth stay fixed.\nEinstein next added the perturbation of the additional term 2GM/c2r3 to this solution\nin order to see whether the turning of the perihelion resulted from this additional term\nin the relativistic equation. If this was indeed the result, then the precession of the\nperihelion would turn to be a result of a relativistic effect, and this was the first\ntriumph of Einstein's new theory.\nEinstein obtained a solution which is an ellipse, but this ellipse has a major axis which\nis not constant and it turns around \u2013 and this causes a precession of the perihelion.\nEinstein wrote the solution to the relativistic equation of the orbit, equation (13) of his\nNovember 18 paper, an advance of the perihelion of 43'' per century.38\nOn December 22, 1915 Karl Schwarzschild, the director of the Astrophysical\nObservatory in Potsdam, wrote Einstein from the Russian front.39 Already on June\n1913 Schwarzschild set an eye on Einstein and he persuaded people in the Prussian\nAcademy to pay Einstein the full 12,000 marks. 40 Schwarzschild set out to rework\nEinstein's calculation in his paper of November 18 of the Mercury perihelion problem.\nHe first responded to Einstein's solution for the first order approximation (4b), and\nfound another first-order approximate solution. The problem would be then physically\nundetermined, said Schwarzschild, if there are a few approximate solutions.\nSubsequently, Schwarzschild went over to a complete solution. He said he realized\nthat there was only one line element, which satisfied the conditions that Einstein\nimposed on the gravitational field of the sun, as well as Einstein's field equations and\ndeterminant condition from the November 18 paper. 41 The problem with\nSchwarzschild's line element was that a mathematical singularity was seen to occur at\nthe origin. If we consider Schwarzschild's line element, then one easily arrives at\nEinstein's relativistic equation of the orbit (11); and this equation gives the observed\nprecession of the perihelion of Mercury.\n\n\f9\n\nDid Einstein arrive at some form of the exact Schwarzschild solution? Writing\nEinstein's approximate metric solution, equation (4b) from his November 18 paper in\nthe form of a line element, and then writing it in spherical coordinates, leads to a first\norder approximation to the Schwarzschild exact solution. 42 Stachel presumes Einstein\nvery likely had not arrived at such a solution before Schwarzschild.43\nIt is interesting to note that Einstein did not include the Schwarzschild exact solution\nin his 1916 review article, which was written after Schwarzschild had found his\ncomplete exact solution to Einstein's field equations; a solution which satisfied the\nsame conditions as Einstein's first order approximate solution. Einstein preferred in\nhis 1916 paper to write his November 18 first order approximate solution. Why would\nEinstein do this? This approximate solution led him to conclude \"Thus Euclidean\ngeometry does not apply even to a first approximation in the gravitational field, if we\nwish to take one and the same rod, independently of its location and orientation, as a\nrealization of the same interval\".44 Einstein needed the first approximation solution to\narrive at this conclusion, as discussed later in the context of the 1916 review paper.\nBack to the week between November 18 and November 25, 1915; after or while\nworking on the solution of the problem of the Perihelion of Mercury, Einstein could\nresolve the final difficulties in his November 11 theory. It took him an extra week to\narrive at the November 25 field equations. On November 26 Einstein wrote his close\nfriend Zangger, however, only one colleague has really understood it [his theory], and\nhe is seeking to clearly \"nostrify\" it (Abraham's expression).45 This colleague was\nDavid Hilbert.\nRecall that on November 19 Hilbert sent Einstein a letter in which he congratulated\nhim on overcoming the perihelion motion. Hilbert ended his letter by asking Einstein\nto continue and keep him up to date on his latest advances. Hilbert did not tell Einstein\nabout the important talk he was giving the day afterwards. Hilbert presented on\nNovember 20 a paper to the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences, \"The Foundations of\nPhysics\", including his version to the gravitational field equations of general\nrelativity. Five days later on November 25, Einstein presented to the Prussian\nAcademy his version to the gravitational field equations. An analysis of the priority\ndispute is brought in detail here.\nThe conclusions of this study are that at the end of the day it appears that Einstein did\nnot \"nostrify\" Hilbert. After November 18 Einstein was no more influenced by\nHilbert's Weltanschauung and theory of matter, and he was thus not in competition\nwith him anymore.46 His new field equations of November 25 with the new trace term\nare related to his work of November 4, and appear to have sprung from it, as shown\nin in this study after discussing Einstein's November 4, 11 and 18 Arbeits.\nAnd what about Einstein's feeling that he expressed to Zangger, according to which\nHilbert was seeking to \"nostrify\" his theory (the November 4 Arbeit that he had sent\n\n\f10\n\nHilbert)? In the printed December version of Hilbert's November 20 paper, Hilbert\n(willingly?...) acknowledged Einstein's priority, and thus it was after all as usual with\nEinstein, a help he had finally (willingly?) given to his colleagues (while competing\nwith them).\n2 First Talk, November 4, 1915: \"On the General Theory of Relativity\"\nOn November 4, 1915 Einstein wrote his elder son Hans Albert Einstein, \"In the last\ndays I completed one of the finest papers of my life; when you are older I'll tell you\nabout it\".47 The day this letter was written Einstein presented this paper to the\nPrussian Academy of Sciences. The paper, \"Zur allgemeinen Relativit\u00e4tstheorie\", was\nthe first out of four papers that corrected his \"Entwurf\" 1914 review paper.48\nEinstein's work on this paper was so intense during October 1915 that he told Hans\nAlbert in the same letter, \"I am often so in my work, that I forget lunch\".49\nIn the first paper of November, the November 4 paper, Einstein gradually expanded\nthe range of the covariance of his field equations. Every week he expanded the\ncovariance a little further until he arrived on November 25 to fully generally covariant\nfield equations.\n2.1. The Hamiltonian (78) of 1914\nIn the introduction to his November 4, 1915 paper Einstein explained to his audience\nat the Prussian Academy of Sciences that his efforts were basing a general theory of\nrelativity, also for nonuniform motion, upon the supposition of relativity. Einstein\nbelieved he had found the only law of gravitation that complies with a reasonably\nformulated postulate of general relativity. He tried to demonstrate the truth of this\nsolution, in \"a paper that appeared last year\", that is, in Part D of his \"Entwurf\" 1914\nreview paper.50\nThe first problematic element that occupied Einstein straight in the introduction to his\npaper was the 1914 \"Hamiltonian\" H, equation (78).51 In his 1914 review paper\nEinstein was evidently quite pleased with his accomplishment of providing a proof\nthat the H, the variation of which leads to the \"Entwurf\" field equations, is uniquely\nfixed by the requirement that it be invariant under the restricted covariance group; and\nthus Einstein thought he had demonstrated that his \"Entwurf\" field equations were the\nonly equations that were invariant under the restricted covariance group.52\nHowever, his triumph did not last very long. 53 He wrote to Lorentz three weeks\nbefore presenting the November 4 paper to the Prussian Academy that, only the\nchoice of (78) enabled the 1914 theory to comply with the Newtonian limit\n(correspondence principle). However, he discovered that this choice was an error.54\n\n\f11\n\nEinstein repeated this claim in his introduction to his November 4, 1915 paper.55 He\ngave the following reasoning, \"The postulate of relativity, as far as I demanded there,\nis always satisfied if the Hamiltonian principle underlies as a basis; but in reality, it\nprovides no tool to establish the Hamiltonian function H of the gravitational field. As\na matter of fact, expressing the choice of limiting H, equation (77) a.a.0, says nothing\nelse than that H should be invariant with respect to linear transformations, a demand\nthat has nothing to do with the relativity of acceleration. Furthermore, the choice\ntaken by equation (78) a.a.0, does not determine equation (77)\".56\nEinstein then said in the introduction to the November 4 paper, \"For these reasons, I\ncompletely lost trust in my established field equations, and looked for a way to limit\nthe possibilities in a natural manner. Thus I arrived back at the demand of a broader\ngeneral covariance for the field equations, from which I parted, though with a heavy\nheart, three years ago when I worked together with my friend Grossmann. As a matter\nof fact, we then have already come quite close to the solution of the problem given in\nthe following\".57\nEinstein concluded the introduction by explaining that, just as the special theory of\nrelativity is based upon the postulate that all equations have to be covariant relative to\nlinear orthogonal transformations, so the theory developed by him in this paper rests\nupon the postulate of the covariance of all systems of equations relative to\ntransformations with the substitution determinant 1.\nAt the end of the introduction to the November 4 paper, after dropping the EinsteinGrossmann theory and adopting the postulate of determinate 1, Einstein said he\ngrasped the charm and saw the significance of the triumph of the general differential\ncalculus as founded by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.58\nIt took Einstein three years of bumpy route to grasp the charm of this differential\ncalculus, because he was developing the physics of general relativity, but also using\nnew and yet not fully developed mathematical tools of differential calculus.59\n2.2. The postulate: only substitutions of determinant 1 are permitted\nIn section \u00a71 \"Laws Forming Covariants\" Einstein presented the methods of absolute\ndifferential calculus, and corrected, and based himself on the detailed presentation and\nequations from his 1914 \"Entwurf\" review paper. He was then about to gradually link\nhimself with general covariance theory, and \"Riemann's covariant\". Einstein could\nfind all the missing ingredients in his 1914 review paper and his Zurich Notebook. He\ndid not need anything else. He said that he could be brief when presenting the laws of\nforming covariants. He needed only to examine what will change in the theory of\ncovariants if only assuming the postulate that substitutions of determinant 1 are\npermitted. 60\n\n\f12\n\nSection \u00a71 can therefore assist in recovering Einstein's switch from the 1914\n\"Entwurf\" field equations to his November 4 equations.\n2. 3. Einstein's October-November changes\nEinstein referred to equations (14) and (17) [or equation (17a)] of his 1914 paper. 61\nThis was the problematic starting point.\nAccording to equation (14) Einstein realized that the determinant\n\ncould be\n\nequated to 1. He thus wrote that the following equation, which is valid for any\nsubstitutions,\n\nbecomes under the premise that only substitutions of determinant 1 are permitted,\n\nthe equation:\n\nAnd the four-dimensional volume element d\u03c4 is therefore invariant.\nAccording to equation (16) from the 1914 paper,\n\nEinstein thus concluded that equation (17) [or (17a)]\nrespect to arbitrary substitutions, and it follows that:\n\nis an invariant with\n\n\f13\n\nThus |g\u03bc\u03bd| is therefore an invariant.\n\nis then a scalar, and this could lead to a\n\nsimplification of the basic formulas of the formation of covariants.62\nIn his 1914 paper the factors\n\nand 1/\n\noccurred in Einstein's most basic\n\nformulas. Einstein realized that in a theory of covariants, in which only substitutions\nof determinant 1 are allowed, the factors\n\nand\n\nno longer occur in the\n\nbasic formulas, and the distinction between tensors and V-tensors is eliminated.63\nAfter omitting the factor\n\nEinstein showed that equations (19) and (21) of his\n\n1914 paper could be written as one equation:64\n\nAs to equations (29) and (30) of his 1914 paper, Einstein understood he could not\nsimplify them. These were actually originally written by Christoffel. However,\nEinstein managed to simplify equations (30) and (31). Einstein simplified (31) to an\nequation (5). He then simplified this equation to a simple definition of divergence\n(5a).65\nAccording to equations (24) and (24a) Einstein wrote instead of (33):\n(6)\n\nEinstein also replaced his 1914 equation (37) with a simpler one by omitting the\n.66 And using the same assumption, in place of equation (41a) Einstein wrote:\n\nA comparison with equation (41b) shows that the law of divergence is the same as\nthat for the divergence of V-tensors in the general differential calculus. Einstein\nemphasized that this remark applied to any divergence of tensors, as can be derived\nfrom (5) and (5a).67\n\n\f14\n\nEinstein limited himself to transformations of determinant equal to 1, and he realized\nthat this step simplified his 1914 equations. Moreover, he obtained covariants which\nwere formed only from the g\u03bc\u03bd and their derivatives.\n2.4. The Ricci Tensor\nEinstein was led to the Riemann-Christoffel tensor of rank four (ik, lm). However, in\ngravitation Einstein was interested in tensors of rank two, the Ricci tensor Gim, which\ncould be obtained from the Riemann tensor by contraction, or multiplication with\ng\u03bc\u03bd:68\n\nEinstein noted that the derivation of this tensor was better obtained from a different\nform of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor (ik, lm), 69\n\nEinstein may have been alluding to the form found in his Zurich Notebook. 70\nContracting the Riemann tensor results in the Ricci tensor Gim, 71\n(13) Gim = {il, lm} = Rim + Sim.\nThis division of equation (13) was indeed already implicitly obtained by Einstein in\npage 22R of his Zurich Notebook.72 Einstein then equated Rim to the second term like\nhe had done three years earlier on page 22R: 73\n\nAnd the first and third terms:\n\n\f15\n\nUnder the constraint of equation (1), that is, to transformations with determinant equal\nto 1, Gim, Rim and Sim were all tensors.\nIt follows from the fact that\n\nis a scalar, and\n\nis a covariant four vector,\n\nbecause of equation (6). Due to (29) from Einstein's 1914 paper, Sim is an extension of\nthis four-vector, and thus it is also a tensor. Since Gim and Sim are tensors, it follows\nfrom (13) that Rim is also a tensor. Einstein noted that the tensor Rim was of utmost\nimportance for gravitation. 74 It actually replaced Einstein's problematic 1914\ngravitation tensor\n\n.\n\n2.5. The Components of the Gravitational Field\nIn section \u00a72 \"Notes on the Differential Laws of 'Material' Processes\", Einstein started\nwith the energy-momentum theorem for matter (including electromagnetic processes\nin the vacuum). 75\nAccording to the considerations of section \u00a71, there is no distinction between Vtensors and tensors; Einstein therefore rewrote equation (42a) from his 1914 paper as\nequation with ordinary tensors:\n\nis an ordinary tensor and K\u03c3 and ordinary four-vector (not a V-tensor and a Vvector). 76\nEinstein then explained, 77\n\"This equation of conservation [(14)] led me in the past to view the quantities\n\n\f16\n\nas the natural expression of the components of the gravitational field, even though in\nview of the formulas of the absolute differential calculus, it is better to introduce the\nChristoffel symbols\n\ninstead of these quantities. This was a fateful prejudice. A preference for the\nChristoffel symbols is justified especially because of the symmetry in their two\ncovariant indices (here \u03bd and \u03c3) and, because the same thing occurs in the\nfundamental important equations of the geodesic line (23b) a.a.0, which, seen from\nthe physical point of view, are the equations of motion of a material point in a\ngravitational field.\"\nEinstein was misled in his search for the gravitational field equations, a search that\ntook him three years after he had adopted the metric tensor as the mathematical\nrepresentation of gravity; this was because he regarded the derivatives of the metric\ntensor (46) of the 1914 paper instead of equation (15a) [below].78\nEinstein explained this to Sommerfeld on November 28, 1915: 79\n\"The key to this solution was my realization that not\n\nbut the related Christoffel's symbols\n\nare to be regarded as the natural\n\nexpression of the gravitational field 'components'. Once one sees this, then the above\nequation is very simple, there is no need to transform it for the purpose of a general\ninterpretation by computing the symbols\".\nAnd he wrote to Lorentz a month later, on January 1, 1916, the following,80\n\"[...] I had already basically possessed the current equations 3 years ago together with\nGrossman, who had brought my attention to the Riemann tensor. But because I had\n\n\f17\n\nnot recognized the formal importance of the { } terms, I could not obtain a clear\noverview and prove the conservation laws [arrive at (14) and (15a)]. I was equally\nunable to see that Newton's theory was contained in it in first-order approximation; I\neven thought to have seen the opposite. Then I fell into the jungle!\"\nThe first term on the right-hand side of (14),\n\ncan be written in\n\nthe form:\n\nAnd according to (24) and (24a) from Einstein's 1914 paper and (6) from the\nNovember 4 paper, Einstein arrived at the components of the gravitational field: 81\n\nK\u03c3 vanishes when\n\ndenotes the energy tensor of all \"material\" processes and the\n\nconservation theorem takes the form:\n\nAccording to (15a) Einstein wrote the equations of the geodesic line, the equations of\nmotion of a material point (23b) from his 1914 paper, in the following form:\n\n2.6. The Field Equations\nIn section \u00a73 Einstein finally derived the new field equations. He started by writing the\ngeneral form of the field equations:\n(16) R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd.\n\n\f18\n\nEinstein wrote, \"we already know that these equations are covariant with respect to\narbitrary transformations of a determinant equal to 1\".82 Hence, (16) were not yet\ngenerally covariant, but only covariant for transformations stratifying equation (1).\nSaying this Einstein knew he was presenting the first paper and this was only the\nbeginning; he was very likely already working on the second part of the theory,\nexpanding covariance. This is especially true in light of the second part of this paper,\nequation (21a), as discussed below.\nEinstein was now using (13a) and (15a), [(14a)] to write (16) in full form: 83\n\nEquations (16) and (16a) are non-linear. On the left-hand side of the equation R\u03bc\u03bd\nincludes the metric tensor and its derivatives; on the right-hand side the sources\ndetermine these variables, the stress-energy tensor. The equations are non-linear\nbecause of\nwhich are defined by (15a).\n\n2.7. Writing the Field Equations in Hamiltonian Form\nAfter writing equation (16a) Einstein demonstrated that his field equations (16) could\nbe brought into Hamiltonian form. This demonstration was essential for Einstein\nbecause it enabled Einstein to show that his field equations (16) \"satisfy the\nconservation laws\".84 Einstein defined a new tensor (the Hamiltonian H) for the\nsecond term of (16a) multiplied with g\u03c3\u03c4:85\n\nAccording to (14a) this tensor had to be connected with the conservation theorem.\nAnd the action [which came instead of equation (61a) of the 1914 paper,\n86\n\n]:\n\n(17)\n\n\f19\n\nThe g\u03bc\u03bd have to be varied and the T\u03bc\u03bd are to be treated as constants.\nThus (17) was equivalent to:87\n\nwhere,\n\nis a function of the g\u03bc\u03bd and of the\n\nThe second term on the left-hand side\n\nis analogous to (14a):\n\nAnd the term in the brackets in the first term on the left-hand side\n\nis:\n\nInserting (19) and (19a) into (18) gives (16a). This step was important because it\nmeans that (18) is equivalent to the field equations (16a). Hence Einstein could use\nthe Hamiltonian form (18) to demonstrate that the principle of the conservation of\nenergy and momentum was satisfied by (16a).\nEinstein multiplied (18) by\n\nwith summation over the indices \u03bc and \u03bd:88\n\nRecall equation (14) the new energy-momentum theorem [replacing (42a) of 1914].\n(14) for the total energy tensor of matter reads:\n\n\f20\n\nEinstein defined the energy tensor of the gravitational field (\"which by the way has\ntensorial character only under linear transformations\"):\n\nUsing (19a) \u2013 the components of the gravitational field \u2013 this could also be written as:\n\nUsing (20a) and the equations [19b] and [19c] Einstein was able to prove\nconservation of energy-momentum: 89\n\nThis equation replaced equation (42c) from the 1914 paper.90\nAs to the above field equations in Hamiltonian form; Einstein's equation (18) from\nNovember 4 replaced Einstein field equation (81) from his 1914 paper:\n\nRecall that in the 1914 paper Einstein used equation (46), the components of the\naction of the gravitational field on a material point; and in November 4 he replaced it\nwith equation (15a) which led to (14a). In 1914 \u2013 by analogy with (46) \u2013 Einstein\nwrote the components of the strength of the gravitational field:91\n\n\f21\n\n(81a) entered into (81) in the 1914 paper. Equation (19) of the November 4 paper\n[which replaced (81a) of the 1914 paper] was analogous to (14a). Equation (19)\nentered into equation (18) of the November 4 paper.\nIn the 1914 paper Einstein used equation (81a) and wrote:\n\nEinstein called\n\nthe energy tensor of the gravitational field and emphasized that it\n\nhave tensorial character only under linear transformations. 92\nIn November 4 he replaced this equation with (20a) and wrote the same thing on\nequation (20a). Equations (15a) and (14a) entered into (16a). And equation (19)\nentered into equation (20a) \u2013 exactly as equation (81a) had entered into equation\n(81b) in the 1914 paper. Hence, again we see that Einstein had actually discovered the\nbasics already in the 1914 paper.\n2.8. Contraction of the Field Equation\nEinstein's next mission was to derive two scalar equations that resulted from his field\nequations (16a) \u2013 these were equations (21) and (22) below; from these he would try\nto obtain the Newtonian limit. Einstein was going to do that by contracting the Ricci\ntensor in his field equations. Einstein multiplied (16a) by g\u03bc\u03bd and summed over \u03bc and\n\u03bd, and using (15a) and (6) he got after some rearranging: 93\n\nRecall equation (20a), which denotes the energy tensor, and it was written in the form\nof equation (20b) using (19a) \u2013the components of the gravitational field. The second\nterm on the left-hand side of (21) is equivalent to the second term on the right-hand\nside of equation (20b). Einstein was thus going to combine between the two\nequations. He first partly contracted (16a) in order to combine between conservation\nof energy-momentum (20) and (21). This would lead to a coordinate condition posed\non (21). The first two terms on the left-hand side of (21) thus vanished. Einstein was\n\n\f22\n\nthen left only with the third term on the left-hand side which was equal to the righthand side term.\nMore specifically: Einstein first multiplied (16a) by g\u03bd\u03bb and summed over \u03bd:94\n\nThe second term on the left-hand side is the second term on the right-hand side of\n(20b), and so Einstein could combine between the two and obtain:\n\nAccording to (20) the divergence of the right-hand side equals zero, and thus the\ndivergence of the two right-hand side terms of this equation vanish: 95\n\nThis equation is the correction of equation (65a) \u2013 written further above \u2013 from the\n1914 paper. Einstein restricted by the coordinate condition (65a) the coordinate\nsystems (to Angepasste Koordinatensysteme). 96 In the scheme in the November 4\npaper Einstein restricted the field equations (16a) by the coordinate condition (22).\nThus (22) led to the vanishing of the first two terms of (21): 97\n\nAnd this equation \"tells us that the coordinate system must be adapted to the\nmanifold\".98\nEinstein showed that taking into consideration equation (22a) then equation (21)\nbecomes:\n\n\f23\n\nAccording to (21a) it is impossible to choose a coordinate system in which\n. If we choose such a coordinate system, then log 1 = 0 and the scalar of\nis set to zero. 99\n\nthe energy tensor\n\n2.9. The Newtonian Approximation\nEinstein considered equation (22a), which showed that the coordinate system must be\nadapted to the manifold. But according to (21a) it was impossible to choose such a\ncoordinate system in which\n\nunless\n\nEinstein was going to\n\ndeal with this problem in the addendum to the November 4 paper.\nEinstein ended his November 4 paper with section \u00a74: The first approximation of\nequation (22a) is the following: 100\n\nEinstein then wrote:\n\"This coordinate system is not yet defined, adding to this would be the determination\nof the same relevant 4 equations. We can therefore set as a first approximation\narbitrarily\n101\n\nEinstein said \"arbitrarily\" (willk\u00fcrlich), because he used this approximation (the Hertz\ncondition) already in his Zurich Notebook on page 19R:\n\n\f24\n\nAt the bottom half of page 22R Einstein arrived at a candidate for the left-hand side of\nthe field equations that was extracted from the November tensor by imposing the\nHertz condition. 102 On page 23L he abandoned the Hertz condition:\nsei = 0 ist nicht n\u00f6tig.\" (not necessary).103\n\nBut there was still a problem with the Hertz condition as Einstein himself explained it\nlater in a note that he has appended at the foot of the letter to Karl Schwarzschild,\n\"The choice of coordinate system demanded by the condition\ncondition] is not consistent with\n\n[the Hertz\n\n\".104\n\nIn the end of the November 4 paper Einstein used (22) above [and equation (15a)] to\nrewrite (16a) in the form:\n\nwhich contains Newton's law of gravitation (Poisson's equation) as an\napproximation.105 Newtonian equations are obtained from the relation between the\ngravitational force and the potential. Einstein demanded that the general form of his\nfield equations would be similar to Poisson's equation.\n2.10. Einstein's First Letter to Hilbert\nMeanwhile on November 7 Einstein wrote David Hilbert and he sent him the proofs\nof this paper of November 4: \"I am sending you the correction to a paper in which I\nchanged the gravitation equations\". Einstein was telling Hilbert that he corrected his\n1914 paper into the November 4, 1915 paper that he was sending him, \"after I myself\nrealized about 4 weeks ago that my previous method of proof was fallacious\". Since\nHilbert had found a mistake in Einstein's 1914 paper, Einstein wanted him to look at\nhis new work. 106\nEinstein explained the mistake (\"found a hair in my soup, which spoiled it entirely for\nyou\"107) that Hilbert had found in his 1914 paper in a letter he sent to Hilbert on\nMarch 30, 1916.108 Einstein wrote, \"The error you found in my paper of 1914 has now\nbecome completely clear to me\".109 In fact Hilbert was troubled by Einstein's theorem\nand its proof from section \u00a714 of his 1914 paper. Recall that this theorem and proof\nalso occupied Tullio Levi-Civita in his correspondence with Einstein between March\n1915 and May 1915. These supplied the formal basis for Einstein's belief that if the\n\n\f25\n\ncoordinate system was an adapted coordinate system, then the gravitational tensor\nwas a covariant tensor.\nIn the 1914 paper Einstein wrote in his proof the following: 110\nHe first wrote equation (61). After varying infinitesimally the g\u03bc\u03bd he rewrote this\nequation in the following form:\n\nand since:\n\nafter partial integration and considering the vanishing of \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd at the boundary of \u03a3,\n\nVia his theorem Einstein proved that under limitation to adapted coordinate systems\n\u03b4J was invariant. Using his theorem thus proved, Einstein concluded that the quantity\nin the brackets of (71) in the above integral times \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd, and in (72) below [tensor\n] divided by\n\nis also an invariant:\n\nAnd Einstein tried to save the covariance of his gravitational tensor\n\n(under\n\nlimitation to adapted coordinate systems)111\nis not valid. 112 Hence, from the\n\nHilbert showed Einstein that\n\nmathematical point of view, equation (71) is also not valid and so is equation (72) and\nEinstein's gravitational tensor\n\n. Levi-Civita also explained to Einstein (while\n\nsupplying other reasons) that (72) was not valid.\n3. Second Talk, November 11, 1915: \"On the General Theory of Relativity\n(Addendum)\"\n\n\f26\n\nNext week, on Thursday, the mathematical-physical class of the Prussian academy\ngathered again to hear a correction to the November 4 paper. Einstein presented this\ncorrection in his Addendum, \"Zur allgemeinen Relativit\u00e4tstheorie (Nachtrag)\".\n3.1 New Condition, the Scalar of the Energy Tensor Vanishes\nIn the previous paper Einstein obtained equations (16) which are covariant with\nrespect to transformations of determinant equal to 1. Einstein then obtained equation\n(21a) and the impossibility to choose a coordinate system in which\nthen\n\nfor\n\nEinstein thus set to solve this problem by dropping the November\n\n4 postulate of determinant 1 and adopting it as a coordinate condition.\nThe (stress)-energy tensor of \"matter\"\n\nhas a scalar (trace)\n\nIt is well known\n\nthat it vanishes in an electromagnetic field. But it differs from zero for matter proper.\nEinstein considered as the \"simplest special case\" an \"incoherent\" continues\n(incompressible) fluid. For this case, said Einstein, the trace of the stress-energy\ntensor does not vanish. 113\nSuppose we reduce matter to electromagnetic processes, and also assume that\ngravitational fields could be related to \"matter\"; that is, gravitational fields form an\nimportant constituent of \"matter\". In such a theory the scalar of the energy tensor\nwould also vanish.\nIn that case,\n\nappears to be positive for the entire structure, but it would still\n\nvanish. Einstein used instead of\n\"matter\",\n\nas the stress-energy tensor to represent\n\nas the stress-energy-tensor to represent \"matter\" (i.e., the\n\nstress-energy tensor is composed of two contributions, electromagnetic + gravitational\nfields). This combination of the stress-energy tensor enabled Einstein to include\nthat could be positive, while in general the whole expression vanished, and\nactually vanishes everywhere. Einstein thus added the coordinate conditions:\n\"we assume in the following that the condition\nfulfilled \".114\n\nis in general actually\n\n\f27\n\nThis hypothesis allowed Einstein to take the last step and to write the field equations\nof gravitation in a general covariant form.\nEinstein arrived at the above hypothesis by making new assumptions on\nelectromagnetic and gravitational \"matter\". What impelled Einstein's change of\nperspective in the November 11 paper?\nRenn and Stachel say the answer seems to lie in Einstein's interaction with Hilbert. It\nwould have been quite uncharacteristic of Einstein to adopt the new approach so\nreadily had it not been for current discussions of the electrodynamic worldview and\nhis feeling that he was now in competition with Hilbert.115\nRenn and Stachel explain that when one examines Einstein's previous writings on\ngravitation, published and unpublished, one finds no trace of an attempt to unify\ngravitation and electromagnetism. He had never advocated the electromagnetic\nworldview. On the contrary, he was apparently disinterested in Mie's attempt at a\nunification of gravitation and electrodynamics, not finding it worth mentioning in his\n1913 review of contemporary gravitation theories. And soon after completion of the\nfinal version of general relativity, Einstein reverted to his earlier view that general\nrelativity could make no assertions about the structure of matter. Einstein's midNovember 1915 pursuit of a relation between gravitation and electromagnetism was,\nthen, merely a short-lived episode in his search for a relativistic theory of gravitation.\nRenn and Stachel examined Einstein's correspondence with Hilbert and say it is quite\nclear that this perspective of a theory of matter was shaped by Einstein's rivalry with\nHilbert. It thus seems quite clear that Einstein's temporary adherence to an\nelectromagnetic theory of matter was triggered by Hilbert's work, which Einstein\nattempted to use in order to solve a problem that had arisen in his own theory, and that\nhe dropped it when he solved this problem in a different way.\nIronically then, Hilbert's most important contribution to general relativity may have\nbeen enhancing the credibility of a speculative and ultimately untenable physical\nhypothesis that guided Einstein's final mathematical steps towards the completion of\nhis theory. 116\n3.2 The First Generally Covariant Field Equations\nIn the previous paper Einstein wrote the following equation, 117\n(13)\n\nand showed that Gim is a covariant tensor.\n\n\f28\n\nEinstein also wrote in the previous paper: 118\n\nAnd he wrote the following equation,119\n\nEinstein understood after November 4 that Gim from (13) could be \"the only tensor\navailable for the establishment of generally covariant equations of gravitation.\nSetting we realize that the field equations of gravitation should be\n(16b)November 11 G\u03bc\u03bd = \u2013 \u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd. \"[..].120\nwhere, \u03c7= 8\u03c0G. Equations (16b)November 11 are generally covariant.\n(One can see that when the gravitational potential is obtained in the 44th component of\nthe metric tensor, g44 = 1 + \u03a6/c2. For low velocities and in the weak fields\napproximation, the equation between the 44th components of the stress-energy tensor\nand the gravitation tensor is equivalent to the Newtonian equation: G44 = \u2013 T44).\nEinstein introduced a new coordinate system in such a way that with respect to this\nsystem,\n\nholds everywhere. In this case Sim vanishes because of (6). Thus\n\none returns to the system of field equations of November 4:\n(16) R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2013 \u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd,\nand these equations are satisfied only by transformations of determinant 1 [equation\n(1) of the November 4 paper]. 121\n\n\f29\n\n3.3 Another Condition,\n\n.\n\nWe are then led back to Equation (21a) of the November 4 paper. Equation (21a)\nleads on choosing\n\nto the result:\n\n. And indeed Einstein ended\n\nhis November 11 paper with equation (21a).\nThe resolution of the paradox \u2013 according to Einstein on November 11, 1915 \u2013 is in\nEinstein's hypothesis of electromagnetic matter and the stress-energy tensor that\nrepresented \"matter\"\nEinstein assumed that\nis due to gravitational\nfields, and it was part of \"matter\", which was essential to equation (13). Einstein\nwrote, \"The generally covariant field equations (16b), formed by our starting point,\ndo not lead to a contradiction only if the hypothesis explained in the introduction\napplies. But then we are at the same time entitled to add to our previous field equation\nthe limiting condition:\n(21b)\n\n.\" 122\n\nIn the November 4 paper, equations (16) or (16a) have led by contraction to equation\n(21a). The important equations in this process were the total energy tensor of matter:\n\nand conservation of energy-momentum: 123\n\nEquation (21a) from November 4 signified to Einstein that equations (16a) from\nNovember 4 could not be general, and these should have been expanded to generally\ncovariant field equations arising from (13).\n3.4 Einstein's Second Letter to Hilbert\n\n\f30\n\nEinstein waited one day, and on Freitag, very likely November the 12th, 1915, he\nwrote his new friend and colleague David Hilbert from G\u00f6ttingen. He first thanked\nhim for his kind letter. 124 Hilbert's letter was not survived, but it was a reply to\nEinstein's letter from November 7, to which Einstein attached the proofs to his\nNovember 4 paper. 125\nWhat could Hilbert tell Einstein in this return letter that he had sent him sometime\nbetween November 8 and 10? Could Hilbert tell Einstein that equation (21a) seemed\nto point to a reconsideration of his November 4 paper? Of course we are unable to\nanswer this question; but in light of Einstein's letter to Hilbert from Friday November\n12, this scenario is unreasonable.\nEinstein wrote Hilbert on November 12 \"the problem has meanwhile made new\nprogress. Namely, it is possible to exact general covariance from the postulate\n; Riemann's tensor then deliver's the gravitation equations directly\". 126\n\nEinstein thus told Hilbert on a progress, and a main finding related to\n\n,\n\nwhich he very likely arrived as a result of reconsidering equation (21a). But it is\ncertainly reasonable that Einstein was influenced by Hilbert's possible letter (sent\nbefore November 10) when arriving at the above solution, as already discussed above:\nEinstein had noticed that the condition\nwhich follows from setting\nin (21a) can be related to an electromagnetic theory of matter.127\n\nLet us summarize the situation as to Hilbert's possible knowledge about Einstein's\n1914 and November 4 theories:\nOn November 7, Einstein said (with regards to his \"Entwurf\" 1914 paper128) that\nSommerfeld noted Hilbert had \"found a hair in my soup, which spoiled it entirely for\nyou\"129 . On November 12 Einstein sent Hilbert two offprints of his 1914 paper. 130\nThus Hilbert read Einstein's 1914 paper before November 7, 1915. (And he possessed\ntwo extra copies by November 13 when replying to Einstein). Hilbert also heard\nEinstein G\u00f6ttingen lectures of summer 1915. He also possessed the proofs of\nEinstein's November 4 paper before November 12, because he sent Einstein a reply\nletter for the latter's November 7 letter.\nEinstein's 1914 review article and \"Entwurf\" theory initially inspired Hilbert in his\nsearch for generally covariant field equations. Even Einstein's Hole Argument\ninspired Hilbert towards a comprehensive axiomatic unifying theory of gravitation\n\n\f31\n\nand matter.131 Most of the general theory of relativity of November 4, 1915 had\noriginated in Einstein's paper of 1914 and in the Zurich Notebook of 1912.\nOn November 13, Hilbert replied to Einstein's letter of November 12. Hilbert was\nfully immersed in Einstein's problem: \"Actually, I first wanted to think of a very\npalpable application for physicists, namely reliable relations between the physical\nconstants, before obliging with my axiomatic solution to your great problem. But\nsince you are so interested, then this coming Tuesday I will develop, approximately\nafter tomorrow (d. 16 of M.), my whole theory in detail\". 132\nHilbert explained to Einstein the main points of his theory, a unification of gravitation\nand electromagnetism,133 and told Einstein that he had already discussed his\ndiscovery with Sommerfeld. He wanted next to explain it to Einstein on Tuesday. He\ninvited him to come at 3 or 1/2 past 5. \"The Math. Soc. Shall meet at 6 o'clock in the\nauditorium-house. My wife and I would be very pleased if you stayed with us\".134\nHilbert presented the following talk on Tuesday, November 16, to the Mathematical\nSociety of G\u00f6ttingen, \"Grundgleichungen der Physik\" (\"The Fundamental Equations\nof Physics\").135\nHowever, Hilbert added a note at the end of the letter: \"As far as I understand your\nnew pap. [paper of November 4], the solution giv. [given] by you is entirely different\nfrom mine [...]\". In addition Hilbert wrote: \"Continuation on page I with the\ninvitation to come for Tuesday, 6 o'clock, many greetings H\". Thus he sent Einstein\nanother page.136\nEinstein replied to Hilbert two days later on November 15. He told Hilbert he could\nnot come at the moment to G\u00f6ttingen, \"but should I wait until I can study your system\nfrom the printed paper, for I am very tired and in addition plagued with stomach\npains. Please send me if possible, a proof copy of your investigation in order to satisfy\nmy impatience\".137\nIn response, Hilbert perhaps sent a copy of the lecture he had given on the subject on\nNovember 16, or else a copy of a manuscript of the paper he would present five days\nlater on November 20 to the Royal Society in G\u00f6ttingen.138\nIt is evident that until November 17 Einstein was still in competition with Hilbert and\nwas influenced by his electromagnetic theory of matter. Indeed Einstein told his close\nfriend Michele Besso, \"In these last months I had great success in my work. Generally\ncovariant gravitation equations. Perihelion motions explained quantitatively. The role\nof gravitation in the structure of matter\".139\n4. Third Talk, November 18, 1915: Perihelion Motion of Mercury\n4.1. The Entanglement of Einstein's Three Papers\n\n\f32\n\nEinstein was already less patient after he had received Hilbert's \"System\". He replied\nto Hilbert on November 18 telling him that \"Your given system agrees \u2013 as far as I\ncan see \u2013 exactly with what I found in the last few weeks and have presented to the\nAcademy\".140\nLet us come back to on Hilbert's November 13 letter to Einstein, \"As far as I\nunderstand your new pap. [paper of November 4], the solution giv. [given] by you is\nentirely different from mine [...]\". And Einstein wrote Hilbert above that, his given\nsystem \u2013 as far as he can see \u2013 exactly agrees with what he had found.\nCorry, Renn, and Stachel say that \"it is clear from this exchange that, at this point, at\nleast one of the two \u2013 and probably each \u2013 is misunderstanding the other's work\".141\nAs far as Einstein understood, he claimed that Hilbert's system of equations (which\nwas mentioned by Hilbert to Einstein already in his November 13 letter to the latter)\nagreed with his own ones presented in the November 4 paper. From Einstein's point of\nview this was very likely so, because of equations:142 (13) Gim = {il, lm} = Rim + Sim,\n(13a), (13b), and (16) from Einstein's November 4 paper; Einstein had presumably\nsent Hilbert these in the proofs to that paper on the November 7 letter to the latter.\nEinstein felt that his work of November 4 was implicitly contained (or \"nostrified\") in\nHilbert's \"System\".\nThe day afterwards Hilbert sent a polite letter in which he congratulated Einstein \"on\novercoming the perihelion motion. If I could calculate as rapidly as you [...]\".143 In\nfact Einstein did not calculate the result that rapidly. A week after November 11, on\nthe coming Thursday, he presented his work on the Perihelion Motion of Mercury; but\nthe basic calculation was done two years earlier with Besso in the Einstein-Besso\nmanuscript. Einstein transferred the basic framework of the calculation from the\nEinstein-Besso manuscript; but he corrected it according to his November 11 field\nequations. 144 In addition, Einstein showed that his theory also predicted twice as\nstrong the curvature of light rays due to gravitational fields as was predicted by\nEinstein due to his \"Enwurf\" theory.\nAlthough Einstein rapidly calculated the perihelion shift of Mercury on the basis of\nhis previous work with Besso, the success of his calculation was also based on his\nNovember 11 theory. The condition\n\n, implied by the assumption of an\n\nelectromagnetic origin of matter, was essential for this calculation, which Einstein\nconsidered a striking confirmation of his audacious hypothesis on the constitution of\nmatter, definitely favoring this theory over that of November 4. Thus when writing\nthe Perihelion paper Einstein was still influenced by Hilbert's electromagnetic theory\nof matter.145\n\n\f33\n\nOn the other hand, Einstein was already departing from Hilbert's theory of matter in\nthe November 18 Arbeit. He there wrote, \"through which time and space are deprived\nof the last trace of objective reality\".146 Thus Einstein began to realize that space and\ntime coordinates have no meaning in general relativity.\nAfter November 11, on Thursday, November 18, Einstein presented to the Prussian\nAcademy his paper, \"Erkl\u00e4rung der Perihelbewegung des Merkur aus der allgemeinen\nRelativit\u00e4tstheorie\" (Explanation of the Perihelion Motion of Mercury from the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity\"). He noted right at the beginning of the paper (in a\nfootnote added after the paper was completed): \"In a forthcoming communication it\nwill be shown that this hypothesis [the trace of the stress-energy tensor vanishes] is\nsuperfluous. It is only essential that such a choice of reference is possible that the\ndeterminant\n\ntakes on the value \u2013 1. The following investigation is independent\n\nof this\".147\nSubsequently Einstein expanded his November 11 paper and presented the final\nversion of his field equations, as will be discussed after presenting the November 18\npaper. When did Einstein get the idea to expand his November 11 equations? Before\nhe received Hilbert's \"System\" or afterwards? Did Hilbert's \"System\" push Einstein to\nthe final solution of November 25? It appears that the answer to this question should\nbe no, as will be discussed after examining Einstein's November 25 field equations.\nBut before discussing this question, one important ingredient to answering it is the\nessential entanglement among Einstein's three Arbeits \u2013 the 1914 review paper, the\nNovember 4 paper and the 1912 work with Grossmann (the Zurich Notebook, p 22R).\nAfter discussing the paper dealing with the Perihelion Motion of Mercury, it will be\nshown here that the final solution of the problem, that was presented by Einstein on\nNovember 25, was dependent on this entanglement among these three papers, and not\nanymore on Hilbert's theory of matter.148 Einstein succinctly explained this issue to\nHilbert in his letter to the latter dating from November 18:\n\"The difficulty was not in finding generally covariant equations for the g\u03bc\u03bd's; for this\nis easily achieved with the aid of Riemann's tensor. Rather, it was hard to recognize\nthat these equations are a generalization, that is, a simple and natural generalization of\nNewton's law. I did it only in the last few weeks (my first communication that I sent\nyou [November, 4]), whereas I considered the only possible generally covariant\nequations, which have now been proven to be correct, 3 years ago with my friend\nGrossmann [Zurich Notebook]. With heavy heart we separated from them, because it\nseemed to me that the physical discussion revealed an incompatibility with Newton's\nlaw. \u2013 The important thing is that the difficulties have now been overcome. I am\npresenting today to the Academy a paper in which I derive quantitatively out of\ngeneral relativity, without any guiding hypothesis, the perihelion motion of Mercury\n\n\f34\n\ndiscovered by Le Verrier. This was not achieved until now by any gravitational\ntheory\".149\n4.2. The Gravitational Field of the Sun\nEinstein started his calculations of November 18 with the static gravitational field of\nthe sun (in vacuum), which has to satisfy, upon suitably choosing the reference frame,\nthe following field equations (16b) of the November 11 paper: 150\n\nThese are (16a) of the November 4 paper or (16) of the November 11 paper once one\nintroduces a coordinate system in such a way that with respect to this system,\n[(21b)].\n\nAnd the components of the gravitational field are: 151\n\nIn light of the field equations (1), Einstein added the hypothesis from his November\n11 paper that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of \"matter\" always vanishes; and he\nimposed the determinant condition: 152\n\nEinstein assumed that the sun was a point mass at rest, which was located at the origin\nof the coordinate system. It produced a gravitational field that could be calculated\nfrom the above equations (1) by successive approximations.\nEinstein explained that, we should be well aware that the g\u03bc\u03bd for a given solar mass\nare still not completely mathematically determined by equations (1) and (3). This\nfollows from the fact that these equations are covariant with respect to arbitrary\ntransformations with determinant equal to 1. But one can assume that by such\n\n\f35\n\nsuccessive transformations, however, all these solutions could be reduced to one\nanother, and one could show that they (for given boundary conditions) differ from one\nanother only formally but not physically. \"Following this conviction, I shall confine\nmyself, for the time being, here to derive a solution, without entering into the issue of\nwhether it is the only possible one\".153\nIn what followed, Einstein intended to obtain a solution, without considering the\nquestion whether or not the solution was the only possible unique solution. If Einstein\narrived at the result for the advance of the perihelion of Mercury which was close to\n45'', then his method of using an approximate rather than an exact and unique solution\ncould not be criticized.154 The first to offer an exact solution to Einstein's field\nequations was Schwarzschild, as discussed after presenting Einstein's result.\nEinstein proceeded to obtain the g\u03bc\u03bd for the mass of the sun by the basic method from\nthe 1913 Einstein-Besso manuscript; he transferred this method to his November 18,\n1915 paper, and corrected it according to his new November 11, 1915 theory.\n4.3. The 0th approximation of the metric field g\u03bc\u03bd of the sun.\nEinstein started from the 0th approximation. g\u03bc\u03bd corresponded to the \"original\"\n(special) theory of relativity, to the flat Minkowski metric: 155\n(4) g\u03bc\u03bd = diag (\u2013 1, \u2013 1, \u2013 1, +1),\nAnd Einstein wrote this succinctly: 156\n\nHere \u03c1 and \u03c3 signify indices, 1, 2, 3; the Kronecker delta \u03b4\u03c1\u03c3 is equal to 1 or 0 when\n\u03c1 = \u03c3 or \u03c1 \u2260 \u03c3, respectively.\nThe approximation given in equation (4a) forms the 0th approximation.\nEinstein then assumed the following: g\u03bc\u03bd differ from the values given in equation (4a)\nby an amount that is small compared to 1. Einstein treated this deviation as a small\nchange of \"first order\". Functions of nth degree of this deviation were treated as\nquantities of the nth order. Einstein next used equations (1) and (3) in light of\nequations (4a) for calculation through successive approximations of the gravitational\nfield157 of the sun up to quantities of nth order exactly. 158\nIn the Einstein-Besso manuscript, Einstein and Besso calculated the metric field g\u03bc\u03bd\nproduced by a static sun (spherical mass distribution). Then they calculated the\nadvance of the perihelion in the field of this static sun.\n\n\f36\n\nIn November 1915 Einstein followed the same reasoning. The metric field g\u03bc\u03bd (the\nsolution) had the following four properties, which were four conditions on the\ngravitational field of the sun: 159\n1) The solution is static: all components of the solution are independent of x4 (time\ncoordinate).\n2) The solution g\u03bc\u03bd is spherically symmetric about the origin of the coordinate system.\n3) The equations\n\nare valid exactly for \u03c1 = 1, 2, 3.\n\n4) At infinity the g\u03bc\u03bd tends to the values of the Minkowski flat metric of special\nrelativity given by (4a).\n4.4. The First approximation of the metric field g\u03bc\u03bd of the sun.\n\nTo first order, the equations (1) and (3) and the four above conditions are satisfied\nthrough the following transformations from:160\n\nto the following solution: 161\n\nThe g\u03c1\u03c3 tends to the Minkowski metric (4a) according to condition 4, and the g4\u03c1 and\ng\u03c14 are determined by condition 3.\nThe\n\nand \u03b1 (=2GM/c2, in Einstein's paper c = 1) is a\n\nconstant determined by the mass of the static sun.\nThis is the covariant metric field g44 of the sun to first order.\nFrom equation (4b), the theory implies that in the case of a mass at rest, the\ncomponents g11 to g33 already differ from zero quantities to first order. Einstein told\nthe reader that \"we will see later, however, that no contradiction to Newton's law (in\nthe first order approximation) arises\".162\nHowever, Einstein found that his theory laid so far, could lead to another result that\noccupied him since 1907; it could produce,163\n\n\f37\n\n\"a somewhat different influence of the gravitational field on the light ray as in my\nearlier work, because the velocity of light is determined by the equation\n\nBy application of the Huygens principle, we find from equations (5) and (4b) through\na simple calculation, that a light ray passing at a distance \u0394 undergoes an angular\ndeflection of magnitude 2\u03b1/\u0394, while the earlier calculation, which was not based upon\nthe hypothesis\n\n, had given the value \u03b1/\u0394. A light ray grazing the surface of\n\nthe sun should experience a deflection of 1.7 sec of arc instead of 0.85 sec of arc\".\nEinstein has calculated the g\u03bc\u03bd in the first order approximation. He was now ready to\ncalculate the components\n\nof the gravitational field of the sun to the first order\n\napproximation. The first order solutions (4b) are substituted in the equations (2) of the\ncomponents of the gravitational field of the sun: 164\n\nwhere, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c4 are the indices and are equal to the values 1, 2, 3 and for the 44\ncomponent:\n(6b)\nwhere, \u03c3 is equal to the values 1, 2, 3. The components in which the index 4 appears\nonce or three times vanish. Thus,\n\n4.5. The Second Order approximation of the metric field g\u03bc\u03bd of the sun.\n\nEinstein needed to determine only three components (\u03c3 = 1, 2, 3)\n\naccurately to\n\nquantities of second order to be able to determine accurately the orbits of the planets\nand the advance of the Perihelion in the gravitational field of the sun. Einstein needed\nfor this the last field equation that he obtained (6b), and the four conditions leading to\nhis solution.\nEinstein wrote the second order field equations (1) for the components\n\n: 165\n\n\f38\n\nUsing equation (6b), and neglecting quantities of third and higher orders, this equation\nreduces to:\n\nFrom this, and using (6b), Einstein obtained the value for the components of the\ngravitational field of the static sun to the second order approximation\n\n4.6. The Motion of the Planets in the Gravitational Field of the Sun\n\nThe next step was writing equations of motion for a point mass moving in the\ngravitational field of the sun to second order. To do so Einstein needed the geodesic\nequation (15b) from his November 4 paper: a planet in a free fall in the gravitational\nfield of the sun moves on a geodesic line according to the geodesic equation (15b): 166\n\nEinstein first said that from this equation we conclude that the Newtonian equation of\nmotion is contained in it as a first approximation. He explained this further: when the\nspeed of the planet is small with respect to the speed of light, then dx1, dx2, dx3 are\nsmall as compared to dx4. It follows from this that we get back the first order\napproximation (4b), in which we always take on the right-hand side the condition\n\u03c3 = \u03c4 = 4.\nThen using equation (6b) we get: 167\n\n\f39\n\nTo first approximation one can set s = x4. Then the first three equations are exactly the\nNewtonian equations.\nOnce Einstein recovered the above Newtonian form, he followed the Newtonian\nprocedure, and introduced polar coordinates r and \u03c6. Einstein wrote for the orbit of the\nplanet the Newtonian law of conservation of energy and the area law, respectively: 168\n\nwhere A and B are constants of the energy, and the Newtonian potential is, 169\n\nRecall that \u03b1 = 2GM/c2 (here c2 = 1). And according to (8a), \u03a6 = \u2212GM/r.\nThus according to equation (8a) equation (8) can be written in the following form:\n\nEinstein then could evaluate the equations to the next order of approximation. The last\nof equations (7) yield together with equations (6b),\n\nand to first order they lead using (4b) (the value for g44) exactly to, 170\n\nEinstein obtained in a few steps using (7), (6c), (9) and (8) for the equations of motion\nto the second order the exact following form:\n\nwhere,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis together with equation (9) determines the motion of the mass point in the\ngravitational field.\n\n\f40\n\nEinstein remarked that equations (7b) and (9) give no deviation for the case of an\norbital motion from Kepler's third law. Einstein added that from (7b) follows the\nexact validity of equation (10): \"The area law holds in the second order exactly, if the\n'proper time' of the planet is used for measuring time\". 171\n\n4.7. The Perihelion Advance of Mercury\nTo obtain the secular rotation of the orbital ellipse from equation (7b), Einstein\ninserted the terms of first order in the parentheses of the right-hand side of (7b), and\nhe used equation (10) and equation (8) and (8a) for this. By this procedure the terms\nof the second order on the right-hand side of equation (7b) were not changed.\nBy this procedure the parentheses of equation (7b) become: 172\n\nOr:\n\nEinstein defined the time variable as\n\n. If B has now a slightly\n\ndifferent meaning, then one arrives at an equation which has the form of the\nNewtonian equations of motion: 173\n\nIn order to determine the equation of the orbit, Einstein could thus proceed exactly as\nin the Newtonian case. Einstein obtained from the above equation, using (8) and (8a)\nthe relativistic law of conservation of energy for the orbit of the planet:174\n\nEinstein then eliminated s from this equation with the help of equation (10), and\nequated 1/r to x, and obtained the equation for the orbit of the planet,\n\n\f41\n\nLet us write this equation in a more familiar form:\n\nWhere again, x = 1/r, E is energy and L is the angular momentum (A = E and B = L).\nThis equation differs from the Newtonian equivalent equation in Newtonian theory\nonly in the last term on the right-hand side. Einstein was now going to calculate that\ndeviation.\nEinstein integrated equation (11) and calculated the angle \u03c6 between the radius vector\nfrom the sun to the planet between the perihelion and the aphelion of the elliptical\norbit of the planet, 175\n\n(an elliptical integral) and \u03b11 and \u03b12 are the roots of the equation,\n\nEinstein wrote that \u03b11 and \u03b12 closely correspond to the roots of the Newtonian\nequation that arises from this equation by omission of \u03b1x3:\n\nThus Einstein considered now the integral without \u03b1x3, and he added to it the integral\nperturbing this Newtonian classical integral as a result of the presence of the term \u03b1x3.\nThe result, using equation (8) and A = 0 (B = 1) in the above integral, was the\nfollowing,\n\nFinally the integration leads to:\n\n\f42\n\nThe planet is orbiting the sun on an elliptical orbit. Einstein assumed that \u03b11 and \u03b12\nsignify the reciprocal values of the mean distance of the planet from the sun at the\nperihelion and the aphelion, respectively. Thus the angle \u03c6 between the radius vector\nfrom the sun to the planet between the perihelion and the aphelion is,\n\nOr,\n\nEinstein thus arrived at the desired equation for the perihelion advance in the sense of\nmotion after a complete orbit: 176\n\na is the semimajor axis, and e is the eccentricity.\nLet us explain it in a simpler way. The Newtonian solution to the equation of the orbit\nis the following:\n\nwhere, r is the distance from one of the foci of the ellipse and r0 is a constant.\nThe relativistic solution of equation (11) is the following,\n\nThe difference between the two equations is the term \u2013d\u03c6.\nOne can write the solution to this equation in the form of (13):\n\nOn introducing the orbital period T Einstein wrote equation (13) in the following\nform: 177\n\n\f43\n\nwhere c denotes the velocity of light in cm per sec.\nEinstein concluded his scheme by saying, \"The calculation yields, for the planet\nMercury, an advance of the perihelion of 43'' per century, while the astronomers\nindicated\nas the unexplained remainder between observations and the\nNewtonian theory. This means full compatibility\".178 A great triumph for Einstein's\nNovember theory.\nOn January 17, 1916, Einstein wrote Paul Ehrenfest.179 Einstein told Ehrenfest,\n\"Imagine my joy at the recognition of the feasibility of the general covariance and at\nthe result that the equations yield the correct perihelion motion of Mercury. I was\nbeside myself for a few days in joyous excitement\".180\nAbraham Pais wrote that later Einstein told Adrian Fokker that his discovery had\ngiven him palpitations of the heart. Pais said that what he told Wander Johannes de\nHass was even more profoundly significant: \"when he saw that his calculations agreed\nwith the unexplained astronomical observations, he had the feeling that something\nactually snapped in him\".181\nRecall that Einstein calculated the deflection of a light ray near the sun from equations\n(4b) and (5). As a matter a fact, Einstein could calculate the deflection of a light ray\nby considering the orbit of the light ray. He could thus arrive at the solution by\ncalculating the geodesic equation of a light ray passing near the sun, and thus he\nwould have arrived at an equation very similar to equation (11),\n\nAgain the additional term \u03b1x3 is the correction term upon the classical solution; and\nthis clearly shows that the effect of the bending of a light ray is a relativistic effect,\nand not, for example, an effect caused by some phenomenon predicted by an emission\ntheory. This additional term thus causes the light ray to deflect from a straight line in\na strong gravitational field.\nIt is thus interesting that Einstein chose to solve the problem of the deflection of the\nlight ray right at the very beginning of his paper, and did not come back to this\nproblem once he obtained equation (11).\n5 Schwarzschild responds to the November 18 Perihelion paper\n5.1 Schwarzschild's Letter to Einstein\n\n\f44\n\nOn December 22 Karl Schwarzschild, the director of the Astrophysical Observatory in\nPotsdam, wrote Einstein from the Russian front. Schwarzschild set out to rework\nEinstein's calculation in his paper of November 18 of the Mercury perihelion problem.\nThere are two versions of the letter. In the draft version Schwarzschild wrote, \"In\norder to familiarize myself with your gravitational theory, I set myself the task of\nsolving completely, if possible, the problem you posed in the paper on Mercury's\nperihelion, and solved approximately. It is easy to specify the most general line\nelement, which has the necessary information for symmetry properties. On this basis,\nI initially found following your way a certain first-order approximation,\n\ntherefore, two arbitrary quantities \u03b1 and \u03b2 [...]\".182\n[Recall Einstein's equation (4b) from the November 18 paper:183\n\nIn the letter to Einstein, Schwarzschild omitted the first term (\u03b1 = 0) in the above\nequation and wrote his approximate solution in a form similar to Einstein's solution,\n\nSchwarzschild wanted to demonstrate that, the problem would be physically\nundetermined if there are a few approximate solutions.\nThen Schwarzschild went over to the complete solution. He said he realized that there\nwas only one line element, which satisfied Einstein's four conditions 1) to 4) imposed\non the gravitational field of the sun 184 from his November 18 paper (static, spherical\nsymmetric and tends to Minkowski's metric), as well as the field equations (1) from\nthe November 18 paper; but Schwarzschild added that this line element is singular at\nthe origin and only at the origin.\nSchwarzschild considered a body, the origin of the coordinates is its geometric center.\nIf one assumes isotropy of space and a static solution, which does not change with\ntime, then there exists spherical symmetry around the center; and one can work with a\nsystem of spherical coordinates R, , \u03c6. The symmetry of the solution means that the\n\n\f45\n\nvariables are independent of the angular coordinates , \u03c6. Since the solution is static,\nthere is no dependence on time, and thus only R is an independent variable, the\ndistance from the center.\nSchwarzschild originally wrote to Einstein the following,\n\"Let [the spherical coordinates],\n\n[and a line element satisfying Einstein's field equations, the determinant condition and\nthe 4 conditions on g\u03bc\u03bd. Schwarzschild wrote this line element in Cartesian\ncoordinates and with the above spherical coordinates wrote it in polar coordinates].\nConsider,\n\nthen the line element becomes [the Schwarzschild line-element]:\n\nSchwarzschild wrote that R, , \u03c6 are not \"allowed\" coordinates, with which the field\nequations could be formed, because these spherical coordinates did not have\ndeterminant 1;185 did not satisfy the coordinate condition (21b) from Einstein's\nNovember 11 paper,\n\n.186\n\nSchwarzschild chose then the non-\"allowed\" coordinates, and in addition, a\nmathematical singularity was seen to occur in his solution when R = 0.\nIn the letter to Einstein Schwarzschild wrote that although the above coordinates did\nnot have the determinant 1, the above line element expressed itself as the best in\nspherical coordinates. 187\nSchwarzschild added, \"The equation of the orbit remains exactly as you obtained in\nthe first approximation (11), 188 except that it must be understood that, for x not 1/r,\nbut 1/R, which is a difference of the order of 10\u221212, thus practically absolutely\nirrelevant\".189\n\n\f46\n\nToward the end of his letter, Schwarzschild returned to his first approximation\nsolution to Einstein's field equations. He wrote that the difficulty with the two\narbitrary constants \u03b1 and \u03b2, which the first approximation gave, is solved in that \u03b2\nmust have a certain value of the order of \u03b13, so that the way \u03b1 is given, the solution be\ndivergent by continuation of the approximation. 190\nSchwarzschild ended his letter to Einstein by saying that, \"As you can see, the war is\nkindly with me, giving me fire, in spite of fierce gunfire, allowing in the very\nterrestrial distance, this stroll in your land of ideas\".191\nEarman and Janssen wrote Einstein's metric in equation (4b) in the form of a line\nelement:\n\nAnd this equation written in spherical coordinates becomes,\n\nwhich is the first order in \u03b1/r approximation to the exact Schwarzschild line element,\n\nwhere, \u03b1 = 2r = 2GM/c2 (c2 = 1 here).\nEinstein replied to Schwarzschild on December 29, 1915 and told him that his\ncalculation proving uniqueness proof for the problem is very interesting. \"I hope you\npublish the idem soon! I would not have thought that the strict treatment of the pointproblem was so simple\".192\n5.2 Schwarzschild's paper\n\nSubsequently Schwarzschild sent Einstein a manuscript, in which he derived his\nsolution of Einstein's field equations for the field of a single mass.193 Einstein\nreceived the manuscript by the beginning of January 1916, and he examined it \"with\ngreat interest\". He told Schwarzschild that he \"did not expect that one could formulate\nso easily the rigorous solution to the problem\".194\n\n\f47\n\nOn the following Thursday, on January 13, Einstein delivered Schwarzschild's paper\nbefore the Prussian Academy with a few words of explanation. 195 Schwarzschild's\npaper, \"\u00dcber das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach der Einsteinschen\nTheorie\" (On the Gravitational Field of a Point-Mass according to Einstein's Theory)\nwas published a month later in the Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen\nAkademie der Wissenschaften.\nIn the paper, Schwarzschild considered Einstein's field equations, the field equations\n(1) from the November 18 paper, and the \"Determinantengleichung\" (3). 196 Consider\nalso the components of the gravitational field and Einstein's equations of the geodesic\nline (the equations of motion of a material point) \u2013 (15a) and (15b) of the November 4\npaper.\nSchwarzschild searched for a solution of the field equations satisfying Einstein's 4\nconditions: the g\u03bc\u03bd are all independent of x4, g\u03c14 = g4\u03c1 = 0, the solution is spherically\nsymmetric, and it vanishes at infinity.\nThen accordingly Schwarzschild wrote the line element satisfying Einstein's above\nfour conditions in polar (spherical) coordinates (Polarkoordinaten):197\n\nWhere F, G, h are functions of r.\nNow the problem with Schwarzschild's spherical coordinates appeared:\nis the volume element, and on performing transformations from\nthe old coordinates to the new ones, the determinant\n\ndiffers from 1.198\n\nOne could use these spherical coordinates but the transformations were complicated.\nHowever, Schwarzschild sitting in the Russian front, found a \"simple trick\" that\nallowed him to avoid this problem: \"Ein einfacher Kunstgriff gestattet jedoch, diese\nSchwierigkeit zu umgehen\".199 And here exactly lies Schwarzschild's mathematical\nvirtues and virtuoso, which Einstein lacked.\nSchwarzschild assumed,\n\nThen,\n\n\f48\n\nholds in the whole volume element. \"The new variables are therefore spherical\ncoordinates of the determinant 1\". In addition, Einstein's field equations (1) and the\ndeterminant equation (3) from his November 18 paper remain unchanged. 200\nSchwarzschild wrote (6) with the new spherical coordinates (7). From this he\nobtained:\n\nSchwarzschild obtained three functions (in fact four, because two are equal according\nto Einstein's conditions): f1, f2, and f3 are functions which satisfy Einstein's (3),\nf1f2 f3 f4 = f1f22 f4 = 1. 201\nIn addition, they satisfy:\nFor\n\n,\n\nFrom (9) Schwarzschild obtained the components of the gravitational field and\nEinstein's field equations. Using Einstein's field equations, components of the\ngravitational field and the determinant condition (3), Schwarzschild obtained by\nintegration, the following values for the functions f1, f2, and f4: 202\n\n\u03b1 and \u03c1 are two integration constants that remained arbitrary, and thus the problem\nwas not fully defined physically. 203\nIf\n\nand 3x1 = \u03b13 \u2013 \u03c1, then f1 is singular (a discontinuity of f1\n\noccurs). However, this is a mathematical singularity. If we move this singularity and\n\n\f49\n\nlocate it at x1 = 0, then we get, \u03c1 = \u03b13. That is, we so-called solved the problem, and\nwe find a relation between the two integration constants \u03c1 and \u03b1.\nSchwarzschild arrived at the following relation for a mass-point,\n\nand in light of \u03c1 = \u03b13,\nR3 = r3 + \u03c1.\n\nAnd up to second order Schwarzschild obtained, 204\n\nInserting the value for R to the above functions according to the above definition, that\nis,\n\nSchwarzschild got,\n\nthen, substituting the above formulae for the functions in equation (9), and coming\nback to the \"standard\" (that is, non-\"allowed\") spherical coordinates, we arrive at the\nexact solution to Einstein's problem,\n205\n\nFrom now on the problem was simple. Consider a point moving along the geodesic\nline in the gravitational field, according to the line-element (14). Schwarzschild was\nlooking for the equation of motion for that point. He assumed isotropy of space and\nthat the motion of the planet was confined to the equatorial plane\n(\n), and he obtained three integrals, 206\n\n\f50\n\nh is a constant of integration.\n\nThis equation is Einstein's equation (10).\nThis integral defines the time unit,\n\nIt then follows,\n\nThe constant h = 1, and for x = 1/R one arrives at Einstein's equation (11):\n\nwhere, c2/h = B (or c = B) and (1 \u2013 h)/h = 2A (A = 0), exactly as it is in equation (11)\nof Einstein's paper, and it gives the observed anomaly in the perihelion of Mercury.207\nLater in 1916, David Hilbert approached Einstein's problem of solving the precession\nof the perihelion of Mercury and re-deriving Schwarzschild's line-element in his\npaper, \"The Foundations of Physics (Second Communication)\", presented to the\nG\u00f6ttingen mathematical-physical class (on December 23, 1916).208\nHe followed Einstein's 3 conditions on the gravitational field of the sun, the solution\nis static, spherically symmetric, and gr4 = g4r, but he did not follow Einstein's fourth\ncondition, according to which g\u03bc\u03bd tends to Minkowskian values at infinity.209\nHilbert arrived at a line-element similar to that of Schwarzschild's one, which he\ndesignated as (45), and concluded that the singularity r = 0 disappears only if \u03b1 = 0,\n\"the metric of the pseudo-Euclidean geometry is the only regular metric that\ncorresponds to a world without electricity under the assumptions 1., 2., 3\".210 Such an\nempty space was inacceptable by Einstein. If \u03b1 \u2260 0, then r = 0; and for positive \u03b1 also\nr = \u03b1. Thus another singularity exists, or as Hilbert puts it, these are places where the\nmetric proves to be irregular. \"The metric (45), [is] not regular at r = o and r = \u03b1 is to\n\n\f51\n\nbe viewed as the expression for gravity of a centrally symmetric mass distribution in\nthe neighborhood of the origin\".211 The singularity at r = \u03b1 is not mathematical as the\none at r = o.\n\n6. Hilbert and Einstein: Nostrification of my Theory\n\nBack to November 1915; after solving the problem of the Perihelion of Mercury\nEinstein could resolve the final difficulties in his November 11 theory. It probably\ntook him an extra week to arrive at the November 25 Einstein tensor. On November\n26, a day after Einstein presented his final version of the field equations, Einstein\nwrote his close friend Zangger,\n\"The general relativity problem is now finally dealt with. The perihelion motion of\nMercury is explained wonderfully by the theory.\nAstronomers have found from observations\n\nI have found with the general theory of rel.\n43''.\nAdd to this the line shift for fixed stars which, as you know, has also been secured [by\nFreundlich in 1915], so this is already considerable confirmation of the theory. For the\ndeflection of light by stars, this theory now provides an amount twice as large as\nbefore. I shall tell you verbally how this comes about.\nThe theory is beautiful beyond comparison. However, only one colleague has really\nunderstood it, and he is seeking to clearly \"nostrify\" it (Abraham's expression). In my\npersonal experience I have hardly come to know the wretchedness of mankind\nsometimes better than this theory and everything connected to it. But it does not\nbother me\".212\nThis colleague was David Hilbert. While Einstein was happy to have found in Hilbert\none of the few colleagues, if not the only one, who appreciated and understood the\nnature of his work on gravitation, he also resented the way Hilbert took over some of\nhis results without, as Einstein saw it, giving him due credit.213\nIn 1912, Max Abraham blamed Einstein's theory of relativity and indeed Einstein as\nwell. Abraham thought that Einstein borrowed expressions from his new gravitation\ntheory. However, it turned out that Abraham gradually converted to elements of\nEinstein's theory. Abraham needed Einstein's result of the mass of energy principle for\nhis theory of gravitation. It was Abraham who corrected his theory according to\n\n\f52\n\nEinstein's ideas, and not the other way round. However, after blaming Einstein, and\nbecause of his rejection towards relativity, Abraham could not accept this state of\naffairs. He thus found an original solution to the question, who actually arrived at the\nidea of the mass of energy?\nEinstein explained all this to Ludwig Hopf on August 16, 1912, \"Recently, Abraham\n\u2013 as you may have seen \u2013 slaughtered me along with the theory of relativity in two\nmassive attacks, and wrote down (phys. Zeitschr.) the only correct theory of\ngravitation (under the 'nostrification' of my results) \u2013 a stately steed, that lacks three\nlegs! He noted that the knowledge of the mass of energy comes from \u2013 Robert\nMayer\".214\nTherefore, \"nostrification\" was Einstein's expression...\nHowever, history repeats itself. First after the polemic with Abraham, Einstein\nencountered Gunnar N\u00f6rdstrom. Like Abraham, N\u00f6rdstrom had also gradually\nconverted to Einstein's theory of gravitation. N\u00f6rdstrom needed Einstein's corrections\nto his theory, his equivalence principle and also Einstein's help with conservation of\nenergy (however, N\u00f6rdstrom and Abraham also somewhat inspired Einstein).\nIn 1915 history repeated itself \u2013 once again. Hilbert was working on the same\nproblem as Einstein. As seen up till now from Einstein's correspondence with Hilbert\nstarting on November 7, it appears that Hilbert needed Einstein's November 4 and\n1914 papers for his theory of gravitation. Hilbert could probably have not arrived at\nhis theory without the help from Einstein. However, Hilbert also inspired Einstein in\nhis November 11 and 18 Arbeits \u2013 as shown by Renn and Stachel.\nRecall that on November 19 Hilbert sent Einstein a letter in which he congratulated\nhim \"on overcoming the perihelion motion\". Hilbert ended his letter by asking\nEinstein to continue and keep him up to date on his latest advances. 215 Hilbert did not\ntell Einstein about the important talk he was giving the day afterwards. Hilbert\npresented on November 20 a paper to the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences, \"The\nFoundations of Physics\", including the gravitational field equations of general\nrelativity; the ones that Einstein presented to the Prussian Academy five days later on\nNovember 25. Could Einstein really take anything from this paper November 20\npaper? In this section I am not going to examine Hilbert's work. For an extensive\nanalysis of Hilbert's work consult Renn and Stachel.216\nSince the Hilbert-Einstein priority dispute is very complicated, let us first start from\nEinstein's final presentation of November 25, and thereafter examine the\n\"nostrification\" issue from two points of view.\nI will show here by a detailed examination of Einstein's November 25 paper that, it is\nreasonable to conjecture that Einstein could not have taken anything from Hilbert. The\nmain thesis that I present here is that Einstein's November 25 field equations sprang\n\n\f53\n\nfrom his November 4 and his 1914 review article work. The entanglement between the\ntwo papers brought Einstein to his final solution of November 25. Einstein\ndemonstrated this quite clearly in his review article of 1916. It appears that after\nNovember 18 Einstein returned to his November 4 Weltanschauung.\nStachel says that after November 18 Einstein no more followed Hilbert's theory of\nmatter.217\n6 Fourth Talk, November 25, 1915: Final Form of Field Equations\nOn Thursday November 25 Einstein presented to the mathematical physical class of\nthe Prussian Academy of sciences his short paper \"Die Feldgleichungen der\nGravitation\" (The Field Equations of Gravitation\").\n6.1 The History of the November Theory\n\nEinstein started his paper by briefly summarizing how in his previous two papers of\nNovember 4 and 11 he obtained field equations of gravitation that comply with the\npostulate of general relativity: i.e., field equations that in their general formulation are\ncovariant under arbitrary substitutions of space-time variables.\nEinstein explained that historically his field equations evolved in the following\nway.218 First in the November 4 paper he found field equations\n(16) R\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd\nwhich are covariant under arbitrary substitutions satisfying equation\n\nEquations (16) contained the Newtonian theory:\n\nBut (16) also led to:\n\n\f54\n\nEinstein said that he found that (16) were equivalent to generally covariant field\nequations if the scalar of the energy tensor of \"matter\" vanishes. Then on November\n11 he arrived at equations,\n(16b)November 11 G\u03bc\u03bd = \u2013 \u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd,\nwhich could be specialized to (16) by introducing a new coordinate system in such a\nway that with respect to this system,\n\nholds everywhere. This led to\n\nimmense simplification of the equations.\nIn fact equations (16b)November 11 for vacuum were at the basis of Einstein's third paper\nfrom November 18.\nWhat happened between November 18 and 25 that brought Einstein back to the\nPrussian Academy with the final version of his field equations? Einstein wrote, \"I now\nquite recently found that one can get along without this hypothesis about the energy\ntensor of matter, merely by inserting it into the field equations in a slightly different\nway. The field equations for vacuum, onto which I based the explanation of the\nMercury perihelion, remain unaffected by this modification\".219\nEinstein summarized the important equations of his previous publications of\nNovember 4 and 11: 220\n\nThe ten generally covariant equations of the gravitational field in space (16b)November 11\nof November 11 in the absence of matter are obtained by setting: 221\n(2) [(16b)November 11] Gim = 0.\nEinstein obtained,\n\n\f55\n\non choosing a reference system in which,\n\nSim vanishes, and equations (2) are simplified to the equations that Einstein used in his\nNovember 18 paper as the gravitational field of the sun.\nEinstein has set as he had done in his November 4 paper,\n\n6.2 The New Field Equation\nSubsequently Einstein wrote, 222\n\"When 'matter' is present in the space under consideration, its energy tensor occurs on\nthe right-hand sides of (2) and (3), respectively. We set:\n\nwhere,\n\nis set. T is the scalar of the energy tensor of 'matter', the right-hand side of (2a) is a\ntensor\".\nEinstein again imposed the condition (3a) and obtained [see equation (3)] instead of\n(2a), 223\n\n\f56\n\nEinstein explained later to Besso on January 3, 1916, that his first paper (November 4)\nalong with the addendum (November 11) still suffered from the lack of the second\nterm on the right-hand side of this equation\n\n. Therefore the postulate T = 0\n\n(from the addendum was necessary). But in his last paper no condition \"results on the\nstructure of matter\" (and T = 0 is not necessary).224 Einstein was going to demonstrate\nthis in what followed.\nEinstein wrote the linearized version of equation (6) already in 1912 in the Zurich\nNotebook on page 20L. In 1912 he extracted from the Ricci tensor linearized\n\"gravitational equations\":\n\nThe scholars did not find any indication in the notebook that Einstein tried to find the\nexact equations corresponding to these equations.225 Did Einstein come back to page\n20L before November 25, and could this give him the idea to extend his November 11\nfield equations to the November 25 field equations? There is no evidence supporting\nthis scenario.\n6.3 Conservation of Energy and Momentum\nEinstein's next step in the November 25 paper was to prove conservation of energymomentum. This also led him to explain the reasons for introducing the second term in\n(2a) and (6).\nEinstein explained briefly to Sommerfeld on November 28:\n\"It is naturally easy to set these generally covariant equations down; however, it is\ndifficult to recognize that they are generalizations of Poisson's equations, and not easy\nto recognize that they sufficiently satisfy the conservation laws\".226\nBut Einstein realized that he could demonstrate that his field equation (2a) satisfied the\nconservation of momentum-energy, once he was \"choosing the frame of reference so\nthat\n\n. Then the equations take on the form,\n\n\f57\n\nI had considered these equations with Grossman already 3 years ago, up to the second\nterm on the right-hand side, but at that time had come to the conclusion that it did not\nlead to Newton's approximation, which was erroneous\".227\nEinstein specialized the choice of coordinated by (3a). Then Tim satisfied the\nconditions, equation (14) times g\u03bc\u03bd of the November 4 paper, 228\n\nEinstein wrote this equation after equation (19a) in the November 4 paper [equation\n(19c)]. 229\nEinstein rewrote the first term on the right-hand side according to equation (15a) of his\nNovember 4 paper, exactly as he had done in this paper,\n\nHe then multiplied equations (6) by\n\nand summed over i and m.\n\nTherefore, because of (7) and (7a), 230\n\n[by (3a)\n\n]\n\nEinstein could prove conservation of energy-momentum for matter and gravitational\nfield: 231\n\n\f58\n\nThe stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field\nof his\n\n232\n\nwas given by the corrected form\n\nfrom November 4,233\n\nEinstein said that Tim of equation (6) should satisfy the condition (7) when restricted\nto the coordinate systems in which (3a) was valid. Equation (7) was equivalent to\nequation (14) from Einstein's November 4 paper: 234\n\nwhich came instead of equation (42a) from Einstein's 1914 paper.\nIt is possible that the term on the right-hand side of the above equation gave Einstein\nthe idea for the second term (the scalar of the energy tensor) of equations (2a) and (6).\n6.4 No need for conditions on the Stress-Energy Tensor\nEinstein indeed explained the reasons for him adding the second term to equations (2a)\nand (6). Conservation of momentum-energy motivated him on the first place to add\nthis term. This was in fact the exact motivation that led him to the \"Entwurf\" field\nequations in 1912 and to the rejection of the November tensor in that year.\nEinstein contracted equation (6) \u2013 multiplied it by gim and summed over i and m. He\nobtained the following scalar equations,235\n\nWhen fully contracting (6) one obtains,\n\n\f59\n\nIn correspondence with (5) Einstein used, 236\n\nThe additional term t in (9) represents the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational\nfield, and it occurs in (9) on an equal footing with the stress-energy-tensor of matter.\nThis, says Einstein, was not the case in equation (21) of his November 4 paper.\nEinstein derived another scalar equation: instead of (22) from his November 4\npaper,237\n\nhe wrote, 238\n\nHence,\n\nInserting (10) into (9a), gives instead of equation (21a) of November 4 the following\nequation,\n\n\f60\n\nEinstein concluded that there was no need to impose other preconditions on the stressenergy tensor of matter, other than it complies with the theorem of energymomentum239 (that is, there was no need any more to assume the condition\n.\n\nEinstein could already possess equations (10) and (9) right after November 18, and at\nthat time he very likely possessed the general idea of equation (6) that led to equations\n(9) and (10).\nIn a letter to Lorentz from January 19, 1916 Einstein explained that his field equations\n(2a) are the only equations that fulfill the following conditions:240\n1) General covariance.\n2) First order components\n\nof matter and derivations of the gim's higher than the\n\nsecond, do not appear in the\n\nand the stress-energy tensor [equation\n\n(9)].\n3) Compatibility with the \"conservation law\" of matter [(equation (8)] without\nany other restrictions for the Tmn's.\nCondition 3 was the conclusion that Einstein drew from equations (9) and (10) and\nfinding that the second term was \u03c7(T + t).\nEinstein concluded his study by saying,241\n\"This then is finally the general theory of relativity completed as a logical structure.\nThe postulate of relativity in its most general version, which makes space-time\ncoordinates into physically meaningless parameters, leads with compelling necessity\nto a very specific theory of gravitation that explains the motion of the perihelion of\nMercury\".\nOn December 10, 1915 Einstein summarized the situation to his best friend Michele\nBesso,242\n\"Ich sandte Dir heute die Arbeiten . Die k\u00fchnsten Tr\u00e4ume sind nun in Erf\u00fcllung\ngegangen. Allgemeine Kovarianz. Perihelbewegung des Merkur wunderbar genau. [...]\nDiesmal ist das N\u00e4chstliegende das Richtige gewesen; aber Grossmann u. ich\nglaubten, dass die Erhaltungss\u00e4tze nicht erf\u00fcllt seien, und das Newton'sch Gesetz in\nerster N\u00e4herung nicht herauskomme. [...]\n\n\f61\n\nHerzliche Gr\u00fcsse, [...] von Deinem zufriedenen aber ziemlich kaputen\nAlbert\".\nEinstein told Besso that his wildest dreams have now come true: general covariance\nand the perihelion of Mercury. This time the obvious was the right thing; but (it was\nnot so obvious for Einstein before November 1915) Einstein and Grossmann believed\nthat the conservation law was not satisfied by their theory; neither they believed they\nwould obtain Newton's law to first approximation. Einstein wished Besso best regards\n(and also to his wife Anna Winteler and her father, with whom he stayed as a youth\nwhile studying in Aarau, and meanwhile became his relative), and signed \"your\nsatisfied kaput Albert\".\n7 Einstein influences Hilbert\n\nEinstein's biographer Albrecht F\u00f6lsing wrote,\n\"Der 'nostrifizierende' Kollege war ausgerechnet David Hilbert, von dem er im\nSommer noch 'ganz begeistert' war aber noch mehr d\u00fcrfte ihn ge\u00e4rgert haben, dass\nHilbert sogar schon einige Tage fr\u00fcher als er selbst die richtigen Feldgleichungen\nver\u00f6ffentlicht hatte\".243\nThe \"nostrified\" colleague (referred to in Einstein's letter to Zangger244) was Hilbert,\nand he was excited in the summer, a few days before Einstein had published the\nNovember 25 field equations. Einstein presented his field equations on November 25,\n1915, but six days earlier, on November 20, Hilbert had derived the identical field\nequations for which Einstein had been searching such a long time. F\u00f6lsing asked\nabout the possible draft that Hilbert sent Einstein before November 18, \"Hat Einstein\nbeim Uberfliegen dieser Arbeit denjenigen Term entdeckt, der in seinen Gleichungen\nnoch fehlte, und dadurch etwa Hilbert 'nostrifiziert'?\" Could Einstein, casting his eye\nover this paper, have discovered the term which was still lacking in his own\nequations, and thus 'nostrified' Hilbert?\"245\nF\u00f6lsing took Einstein's phraseology \"nostrifiziert\" and turned it against him. In fact, it\nis reasonable to assume that Einstein had discovered the second term in his equations\n(2a) by \"casting his eye over\" his own Arbeit of November 4, by reconsidering his\nequations of conservation of momentum-energy. This hypothesis is mostly\nstrengthened by Einstein's own explanation from his November 25 paper, and the\nfindings regarding Hilbert's November 20 paper seem to deny Einstein's\nnostrification.\nAccording to these findings Einstein could have probably not have taken anything\npertaining to the November 25 field equations from Hilbert's paper, or the summary\nsent to him. Of course on may ask whether there is a chance that this summary\n\n\f62\n\ncontained the correct explicit field equations in a part that is today missing? Stachel\nsays there is always a chance, but a careful examination of a small missing part of the\nfirst proofs of Hilbert's November 20 paper shows that there is hardly 1/3 of a page\nroom left for a few lines of text and equations; and all the evidence indicates that\nthese lines did not include Hilbert's final form of the field equations.246\nIndeed, the situation was quite the reverse: the question is whether Hilbert might have\ntaken something from Einstein's 25 November paper, because it was quite possible for\nhim to do so.247\nThe main point is the following. Hilbert submitted his paper to the G\u00f6ttingen\nAcademy of Sciences on November 20, 1915. Einstein's paper in which he gave the\nfinal form of his generally covariant field equations was submitted to the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences on November 25, 1915. Hilbert very likely sent to Einstein\nbefore November 18 a summary of his November 20 work.248\nThe November 20, 1915 proofs bear a printer's date stamp, \"6 December 1915\". The\npaper was not yet published.249 According to F\u00f6lsing, the November 20, 1915 proofs\nof Hilbert paper are equivalent to Hilbert's printed paper and thus contain an\nequivalent version of equation (2a) or (6) of Einstein's November 25 paper. However,\nthe November 20, 1915 paper did not contain a generally covariant theory. And thus\nrepresent Hilbert's states of work submitted on November 20. Hilbert started\ncorrecting his proofs only on December 6, 1915. Einstein's November 25, 1915 paper\nwas published on December 2, 1915. Hilbert's paper was published only on March 31,\n1916, and he had plenty of time to correct his November 20, 1915 paper according to\nEinstein's November Arbeits, including that of November 25, 1915. Hilbert indeed\nrewrote his proofs from November 20 sometime between December 1915 and March\n1916. 250\nThere are differences between the proofs and the printed version of the paper from\nMarch 1916. In the November 20 proofs Hilbert asserted that the theory he was\ndeveloping could not be generally covariant. He based his assertion on a slightly more\nsophisticated version of Einstein's Hole Argument, and he cites Einstein's 1914\ndiscussion of this argument. Hilbert was adopting Einstein's line of reasoning from\n1913-mid 1915 just at the time that Einstein was abandoning it, in favor of a return to\ngeneral covariance.251\nIn addition, in Hilbert's proofs of November 20 the gravitational field equations do\nnot appear explicitly. 252 In the published version of March 1916 \u2013 after Einstein had\npublished the final form of his field equations \u2013 the expression equivalent in form to\nEinstein's November 25 equations (2a) and (6) is written down explicitly. Corry, Renn\nand Stachel indeed claim that knowledge of Einstein's result [equations (2a) and (6)]\nmay have been crucial to Hilbert's introduction of the second term in his equation,\nwhich was equivalent in form to these equations of Einstein. 253 And thus Einstein's\n\n\f63\n\npapers helped Hilbert in putting his November 20 paper in a malleable form\ncontaining generally covariant field equations.\nFinally, in the proofs of 6 December, Hilbert supplemented his reference to the\ngravitational potentials g\u03bc\u03bd in handwriting with the phrase \"first introduced by\nEinstein\".254\nHowever, Renn and Stachel found lately that, in the December 6 proofs in\nhandwriting Hilbert not only acknowledged Einstein's priority but attempted to\nplacate him. In the introduction to his paper Hilbert wrote,255\n\"In the following \u2013 in the sense of the axiomatic method \u2013 I would like to develop,\nessentially from three axioms a new system of basic equations of physics, of ideal\nbeauty, concerning, I believe, the solution of the problems presented\".\nHilbert deleted the word \"new\", and this is a clear indication that he had read\nEinstein's November 25 paper and recognized that his own equations are formally\nequivalent (because of where the trace term occurs) to Einstein's.\nOn December 20, 1915 Einstein wrote Hilbert,256\n\"There has been certain resentment between us, the cause of which I do not want to\nanalyze. I have fought against the associated feeling of bitterness, and this with\ncomplete success. I think of you again with unmixed kindness, and I ask you to try to\ndo the same with me. It is objectively a shame when two real guys that have emerged\nfrom this shabby world do not give each other a little pleasure\".\nIn the March 1916 printed version of his November 20 paper Hilbert added a\nreference to Einstein's November 25 paper and wrote, \"the differential equations of\ngravitation that result are, as it seems to me, in agreement with the magnificent theory\nof general relativity established by Einstein in his last papers\".257\nOn May, 27, 1916 Hilbert replied to Einstein's letter, and then only in response to a\npost card from Einstein with some questions about Hilbert's first paper on his new\ntheory, which has just been published. Hilbert invited Einstein to visit G\u00f6ttingen again\nand stay with him; but in spite of several invitations over the next few years, Einstein\nnever came, perhaps because of Einstein's poor health in the last years of World War\nI. However, they continued to correspond over issues connected with Hilbert's\npaper.258\n\nI am indebted to Prof John Stachel for his assistance and invaluable suggestions.
