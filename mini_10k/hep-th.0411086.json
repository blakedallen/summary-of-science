G\u00f6ttingen\n\nAbstract\nIt is discussed to which extent the AdS-CFT correspondence is\ncompatible with fundamental requirements in quantum field theory.\n\nIntroduction\nWe reserve the term \"AdS-CFT correspondence\" for the field theoretical\nmodel that was given by Witten [26] and Polyakov et al. [16] to capture some\nessential features of Maldacena's Conjecture [20]. It provides the generating\nfunctional for conformally invariant Schwinger functions in D-dimensional\nMinkowski space by using a classical action I[\u03c6AdS ] of a field on D + 1dimensional Anti-deSitter space. In contrast to Maldacena's Conjecture\nwhich involves string theory, gravity, and supersymmetric large N gauge\ntheory, the AdS-CFT correspondence involves only ordinary quantum field\ntheory (QFT), and should be thoroughly understandable in corresponding\nterms.\nIn these lectures, we want to place AdS-CFT into the general context of\nQFT. We are not so much interested in the many implications of AdS-CFT\n[1], as rather in the question \"how AdS-CFT works\". We shall discuss in\nparticular\n\u2022 why the AdS-CFT correspondence constitutes a challenge for orthodox QFT\n\u2022 how it can indeed be (at least formally) reconciled with the general\nrequirements of QFT\n\u2022 how the corresponding (re)interpretation of the AdS-CFT correspondence matches with other, more conservative, connections between\nQFT on AdS and conformal QFT, which have been established rigorously.\n\u2217\n\npresented at the III. Summer School in Modern Mathematical Physics, Zlatibor (Serbia and Montenegro), August 2004; supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\n\u2020\ne-mail address: rehren@theorie.physik.uni-goe.de\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nThe lectures are meant to be introductory. When we refer to rigorous\nmethods and results in QFT, our exposition never has the ambition of\nbeing rigorous itself. We shall avoid the technical formulation of almost\nall details, but nevertheless emphasize whenever such details are crucial for\nsome arguments, though often enough neglected.\nTo prepare the ground, we shall in the first lecture remind the reader of\nsome general facts about QFT (and its formal Euclidean functional integral\napproach), with special emphasis on the passage between real-time QFT\nand Euclidean QFT, the positivity properties which are necessary for the\nprobability interpretation of quantum theory, and some aspects of large N\nQFT.\nOnly in the second lecture, we turn to AdS-CFT, pointing out its apparent conflict (at a formal level) with positivity. We resolve this conflict by (equally formally) relating the conformal quantum field defined by\nAdS-CFT with a limit of \"conventional\" quantum fields which does fulfill\npositivity.\nThe third lecture is again devoted to rigorous methods of QFT, which\nbecome applicable to AdS-CFT by virtue of the result of the second lecture,\nand which concern both the passage from AdS to CFT and the converse\npassage.\nTo keep the exposition simple, and in order to emphasize the extent to\nwhich the AdS-CFT correspondence can be regarded as a model-independent\nconnection, we shall confine ourselves to bosonic (mostly scalar) fields (with\narbitrary polynomial couplings), and never mention the vital characteristic\nproblems pertinent to gauge (or gravity) theories.\n\nLecture 1:\n\nQFT\n\nA fully satisfactory (mathematically rigorous) QFT must fulfill a number\nof requirements. These are, in brief:\n\u2022 Positive definiteness of the Hilbert space inner product.\n\n\u2022 Local commutativity of the fields1 \u03c6\u0302 at spacelike separation.\n\u2022 A unitary representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group, implementing covariant transformations of the fields.\n\u2022 Positivity of the energy spectrum in one, and hence every inertial\nframe.\n\u2022 Existence (and uniqueness) of the ground state = vacuum \u03a9.\nClearly, for one reason or another, one may be forced to relax one or the\nother of these requirements, but there should be good physical motivation\nto do so, and sufficient mathematical structure to ensure a safe physical\ninterpretation of the theory. E.g., one might relax the locality requirement\n1\nWe use the notation \u03c6\u0302 in order to distinguish the real-time quantum field (an\noperator[-valued distribution] on the Hilbert space) from the Euclidean field \u03c6E (a random variable) and its representation by a functional integral with integration variable \u03c6,\nsee below.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n3\n\nat very short distances where it has not been tested directly, as long as\nmacrocausality is maintained; or one might admit modifications of the relativistic energy-momentum relation at very high energies. But it is known\nthat there are very narrow limitations on such scenarios (e.g., [22], see also\n[24] for a critical discussion of the axioms). Hilbert space positivity may\nbe absent at intermediate steps, notably in covariant approaches to gauge\ntheory, but it is indispensable if one wants to saveguard the probabilistic\ninterpretation of expectation values of observables.\nThe above features are reflected in the properties of the vacuum expectation values of field products\nW (x1 , . . . , xn ) = (\u03a9, \u03c6\u0302(x1 ) . . . \u03c6\u0302(xn )\u03a9),\n\n(1.1)\n\nconsidered as \"functions\" (in fact, distributions) of the field coordinates xi ,\nknown as the Wightman distributions.\nLocal commutativity and covariance appear as obvious symmetry properties under permutations (provided xi and xi+1 are at spacelike distance)\nand Poincar\u00e9 transformations, respectively. The uniqueness of the vacuum\nis a cluster property (= decay behaviour at large spacelike separations).\nFurther consequences for the Wightman distributions will be described in\nthe sequel.\n\n1.1\n\nThe Wick rotation\n\nThe properties of Wightman functions allow for the passage to Euclidean\n\"correlation functions\", known as the \"Wick rotation\". Because this passage and the existence of its inverse justify the most popular Euclidean\napproaches to QFT, let us study in more detail what enters into it.\nThe first step is to observe that by the spectrum condition, the Wightman distributions can be analytically continued to complex points zi = xi +\niyi for which yi \u2212yi+1 are future timelike (the \"forward tube\"), by replacing\nthe factors e\u2212iki *xi in the Fourier representation by e\u2212iki *zi . The reason is\nthat the momenta ki + . . . + kn\u22121 + kn (being eigenvalues of theQmomentum\noperator) can only take values in the future light-cone, so that i e\u2212iki *zi =\neikn *(zn\u22121 \u2212zn ) * ei(kn\u22121 +kn )*(zn\u22122 \u2212zn\u22121 ) * ei(kn\u22122 +kn\u22121 +kn )*(zn\u22123 \u2212zn\u22122 ) * . . . decay\nrapidly if zi \u2212 zi\u22121 have future timelike imaginary parts, and would rapidly\ndiverge otherwise (i.e., outside the forward tube) for some of the contributing momenta. The analytically continued distributions are in fact analytic\nfunctions in the forward tube. The Wightman distributions are thus boundary values (as Im (zi \u2212 zi+1 ) \u0581 0 from the future timelike directions) of\nanalytic Wightman functions.\nTogether with covariance which implies invariance under the complex\nLorentz group, the analytic Wightman functions can be extended to a much\nlarger complex region, the \"extended domain\". Unlike the forward tube,\nthe extended domain contains real points which are spacelike to each other,\nhence by locality, the Wightman functions are symmetric functions in their\ncomplex arguments. This in turn allows to extend the domain of analyticity\nonce more, and one obtains analytic functions defined in the BargmannHall-Wightman domain. This huge domain contains the \"Euclidean points\"\n\n\f4\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nzi = (i\u03c4i , ~xi ) with real \u03c4i , ~xi . Considered as functions of \u03bei := (~xi , \u03c4i ), the\nWick rotated functions are called the \"Schwinger functions\" Sn (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ),\nwhich are symmetric, analytic at \u03bei 6= \u03bej , and invariant under the Euclidean\ngroup.\nIt is convenient to \"collect\" all Schwinger functions in a generating\nfunctional\n\u0011\nD R\nE\nX 1 Z \u0010Y\nS[j] :=\nd\u03bei j(\u03bei ) Sn (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ) \u2261 e d\u03be \u03c6E (\u03be)j(\u03be) . (1.2)\nn!\n\nKnowledge of S[j] is equivalent to the knowledge of the Schwinger functions,\nbecause the latter are obtained by variational derivatives,\nSn (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ) =\n\nY\ni\n\n\u03b4\nS[j]|j=0 .\n\u03b4j(\u03bei )\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe generating functional for the \"truncated (connected) Schwinger functions\" SnT (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ) (products of lower correlations subtracted) is S T [j] =\nlog S[j].\nIt should be emphasized that Fourier transformation, Lorentz invariance, and energy positivity enter the Wick rotation in a crucial way, so that\nin general curved spacetime, where none of these features is warranted, anything like the Wick rotation may by no means be expected to exist. Hence,\nwe have\nLesson 1. Euclidean QFT is a meaningful framework, related to\nsome real-time QFT, only provided there is sufficient spacetime\nsymmetry to establish the existence of a Wick rotation.\nAdS is a spacetime where the Wick rotation can be established. Although a more global treatment is possible, pertaining also to QFT on a\ncovering of AdS [6], we present the core of the argument in a special chart\n(the Poincar\u00e9 coordinates), in which AdS appears as a warped product of\nMinkowski spacetime R1,D\u22121 with R+ .\nNamely, AdS is the hyperbolic surface in R2,D given by X * X = 1 in\nthe metric of R2,D . In Poincar\u00e9 coordinates,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz 1 \u2212 x\u03bc x\u03bc x\u03bc z 1 + x\u03bc x\u03bc\nX=\n+\n, ,\u2212 +\n(z > 0).\n(1.4)\n2\n2z\nz\n2\n2z\nIn these coordinates, the metric is\nds2 = z \u22122 (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dz 2 ),\n\n(1.5)\n\nhence for each fixed value of z, it is a multiple of the Minkowski metric.\nThe group of isometries of AdS is SO(2, D), which is also the conformal group of Minkowski spacetime R1,D\u22121 . It contains a subgroup\nSO(1, D \u2212 1) \u22c9 R1,D\u22121 preserving z and transforming the coordinates x\u03bc\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n5\n\nlike the Poincar\u00e9 group. The rest of the group are transformations which\nact non-linearly on the coordinates z and x in such a way that the boundary z = 0 is preserved, and its points (z = 0, x) transform like scale and\nspecial conformal transformations of x.\nThe natural spectrum condition on AdS requires positivity of the generator of the timelike \"rotations\" in the two positive signature directions\nof the embedding space. This generator turns out to be the \"conformal Hamiltonian\" 21 (P 0 + K 0 ), which is positive in a unitary representation if and only if P 0 is positive. Hence, the AdS spectrum condition\nis equivalent to the Poincar\u00e9 spectrum condition, and the Wightman distributions have analytic continuations in the Poincar\u00e9 forward tube. Furthermore, the complex AdS group contains the complex Poincar\u00e9 group,\nand local commutativity at spacelike AdS distance (which is equivalent to\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc \u2212 (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 < 0) entails local commutativity at spacelike Minkowski distance (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc < 0. Therefore, by repeating the\nsame reasoning as in Sect. 1.1 for the variables x\u03bc only, the Bargmann-HallWightman domain of analyticity of the AdS Wightman functions contains\nthe points (zi , i\u03c4i , ~xi ) with real zi , \u03c4i , ~xi . Writing \u03be = (~x, \u03c4 ) as before, these\n\"Euclidean points\" coincide with the points of Euclidean AdS\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz 1 \u2212 |\u03be|2 \u03be \u03bc z 1 + |\u03be|2\n, , +\n\u039e= \u2212 +\n(z > 0),\n(1.6)\n2\n2z\nz 2\n2z\nwhich satisfy \u039e * \u039e = 1 in the metric of R1,D+1 .\n\n1.2\n\nReconstruction and positivity\n\nBy famous reconstruction theorems [25, 21], the Wightman distributions or\nthe Schwinger functions completely determine the quantum field, including\nits Hilbert space. For the reconstruction of the Hilbert space, one defines\nthe scalar product between improper state vectors \u03c6\u0302(x1 ) . . . \u03c6\u0302(xn )\u03a9 to be\ngiven by the Wightman distributions. This scalar product must be positive:\nLet P = P [\u03c6\u0302] denote any polynomial in smeared fields. Then one has\n(\u03a9, P \u2217 P \u03a9) = ||P \u03a9||2 \u2265 0.\n\n(1.7)\n\nInserting the smeared fields for P , (\u03a9, P \u2217 P \u03a9) is a linear combination of\nsmeared Wightman distributions. Thus, every linear combination of smeared\nWightman distributions which can possibly arise in this way must be nonnegative. (It could be zero because, e.g., P contains a commutator at\nspacelike distance such that P = 0, or the Fourier transforms of the smearing functions avoid the spectrum of the four momenta such that P \u03a9 = 0.)\nThis property translates, via the Wick rotation, into a property called\n\"reflection positivity\" of the Schwinger functions: Let P = P [\u03c6E ] denote a\npolynomial in Euclidean fields smeared in a halfspace \u03c4i > 0, and \u03b8(P ) the\nsame polynomial smeared with the same functions reflected by \u03c4i 7\u2192 \u2212\u03c4i .\nThen\nD\nE\n\u03b8(P )\u2217 P \u2265 0.\n(1.8)\n\n\f6\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nThis expression is a linear combination of smeared Schwinger functions. Reflection positivity means that every linear combination which can possibly\narise in this way must be non-negative.\nAs an example for the restrictivity of reflection positivity, we consider the 2-point function of a Euclidean conformal scalar field of scaling dimension \u2206, S2 (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) = |\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 |\u22122\u2206 . Ignoring smearing, we choose\nP [\u03c6E ] = \u03c6E ( \u03c42 , 0) \u2212 \u03c6E ( \u03c42 , x) and obtain\nD\nE\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b8(P )\u2217 P = 2 \u03c4 \u22122\u2206 \u2212 (\u03c4 2 + x2 )\u2212\u2206 .\n(1.9)\n\nObviously, this is positive iff \u2206 > 0. This is the unitarity bound for conformal fields in 2 dimensions. (More complicated configurations of Euclidean\npoints in D > 2 dimensions give rise to the stronger bound \u2206 \u2265 D\u22122\n2 .)\nThe positivity requirements (1.7) resp. (1.8) are crucial for the reconstructions of the real-time quantum field, which start with the construction\nof the Hilbert space by defining scalar products on suitable function spaces\nin terms of Wightman or Schwinger functions of the form (1.7) resp. (1.8).\nAs conditions on the Wightman or Schwinger functions, the positivity\nrequirements are highly nontrivial. It is rather easy to construct Wightman functions which satisfy all the requirements except positivity, and it\nis even more easy to guess funny Schwinger functions which satisfy all the\nrequirements except reflection positivity. In fact, the remaining properties\nare only symmetry, Euclidean invariance, and some regularity and growth\nproperties, which one can have almost \"for free\".\nBut without the positivity, these functions are rather worthless. From\nnon-positive Wightman functions one would reconstruct fields without a\nprobability interpretation, and reconstruction from non-positive Schwinger\nfunctions would not even yield locality and positive energy, due to the\nsubtle way the properties intervene in the Wick rotation. In particular, the\ninverse Wick rotation uses methods from operator algebras which must not\nbe relied on in \"Hilbert spaces\" with indefinite metric.\nLesson 2. Schwinger functions without reflection positivity have\nhardly any physical meaning.\n\n1.3\n\nFunctional integrals\n\nThe most popular way to obtain Schwinger functions which are at least in\na formal way reflection-positive, is via functional integrals [14]: the generating functional is\nZ\nR\n\u22121\nD\u03c6 e\u2212I[\u03c6] * e d\u03be \u03c6(\u03be)j(\u03be) ,\n(1.10)\nS[j] := Z\nR\nwhere I[\u03c6] is a Euclidean action of the form 12 (\u03c6, A\u03c6) + d\u03beV (\u03c6(\u03be)) with a\nquadratic form A (e.g., the Klein-Gordon operator) which determines a free\npropagator,\nand an interaction potential V (\u03c6). The normalization factor is\nR\n\u2212I[\u03c6]\nZ = D\u03c6 e\n.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n7\n\nVarying with respect to the sources j(\u03be), the Schwinger functions are\nZ\n\u22121\nSn (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ) := Z\nD\u03c6 \u03c6(\u03be1 ) . . . \u03c6(\u03ben ) e\u2212I[\u03c6] ,\n(1.11)\nand one may think of them as the moments\nD\nE\nSn (\u03be1 , . . . \u03ben ) = \u03c6E (\u03be1 ) . . . \u03c6E (\u03ben ) ,\n\n(1.12)\n\nof random variables \u03c6E (\u03be), such that the functional integration variables\n\u03c6 are the possible values of \u03c6E with the probability measure D\u03bc[\u03c6] =\nZ \u22121 D\u03c6 e\u2212I[\u03c6] .\nThe difficult part in constructing a Euclidean QFT along these lines is,\nof course, to turn the formal expressions (1.10) or (1.11) into well-defined\nquantities [17, 14]. This task can be attacked in several different ways\n(e.g., perturbative or lattice approximations, or phase space cutoffs of the\nmeasure) which all involve the renormalization of formally diverging quantities. In the perturbative approach, the problems are at least threefold:\nwhen one separates the interaction part\nfrom the quadratic part of the acR\ntion and writes D\u03bc[\u03c6] \u221d D\u03bc0 [\u03c6]e\u2212 d\u03beV (\u03c6(\u03be)) where D\u03bc0 [\u03c6] is a Gaussian\nmeasure, and expands the exponential into a power series, then first, V (\u03c6)\nis not integrable with respect to D\u03bc0 because it is not a polynomial in\nsmeared fields (UV problem); second, the \u03be integrations over V (\u03c6(\u03be)) will\ndiverge (IR problem); third, the series will fail to converge. We shall by\nno means enter the problem(s) of renormalization in these lectures, but we\nemphasize\nLesson 3. The challenge of constructive QFT via functional integrals is to define the measure, in such a way that its formal\nbenefits are preserved.\nAmong the \"formal benefits\", there is reflection positivity which, as we\nhave seen, is necessary to entail locality, energy positivity, and Hilbert space\npositivity for the reconstructed real-time field. It is not to be confused with\nthe probabilistic positivity property of the measure, which usually gets lost\nupon renormalization, so that renormalized Schwinger functions in fact fail\nto be the moments of a measure; but this latter property is not required\nby general principles.\nLet us display the formal argument why the prescription (1.11) fulfills\nreflection positivity. It consists in splitting\ne\u2212\n\nR\n\nd\u03be V (\u03c6(\u03be))\n\n= e\u2212\n\nR\n\n\u03c4 <0\n\nd\u03be V (\u03c6(\u03be))\nR\n\n* e\u2212\n\nR\n\n\u03c4 >0\n\nd\u03be V (\u03c6(\u03be))\n\n\u2261 \u03b8(F )\u2217 F\n\nwith \u03be = (~x, \u03c4 ) and F = F [\u03c6] = e\u2212 \u03c4 >0 d\u03be V (\u03c6(\u03be)) . Then\nE D\nE\nD\n\u03b8(P )\u2217 P = \u03b8(F P )\u2217 F P\n0\n\n(1.13)\n\n(1.14)\n\nwhere h. . .i0 is the expectation value defined with the Gaussian measure\nD\u03bc0 [\u03c6], which is assumed to fulfill reflection positivity. Viewing F as\n\n\f8\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nan exponential series of smeared field products, h\u03b8(F P )\u2217 F P i0 and hence\nh\u03b8(P )\u2217 P i is positive. We see that it is important that the potential is \"local\" in the sense that it depends only on the field at a single point, in order\nto allow the split (1.13) into positive and negative Euclidean \"time\".\nNote that in gauge theories already the Gaussian measure D\u03bc0 will fail\nto be reflection positive, a fact which has to be cured by Gupta-Bleuler of\nBRST methods.\nEven with the most optimistic attitude towards Lesson 3 (\"nothing goes\nwrong upon renormalization\"), we shall retain from Lesson 2 as a guiding\nprinciple:\nLesson 4. A functional integral should not be trusted as a useful\ndevice for QFT if it violates reflection positivity already at the\nformal level.\n\n1.4\n\nSemiclassical limit and large N limit\n\nFor later reference, we mention some facts concerning the effect of manipulations of generating functionals (irrespective how they are obtained) on\nreflection positivity of the Schwinger functions.\nThe product S[j] = S (1) [j]S (2) [j] of two (or more) reflection-positive\ngenerating functional is another reflection-positive generating functional.\nIn fact, because the truncated Schwinger functions are just added, the\nreconstructed quantum field equals \u03c6(1) \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u03c6(2) defined on H =\nH(1) \u2297 H(2) , or obvious generalizations thereof for more than two factors.\nIn particular, positivity is preserved if S[j] is raised to a power \u03bd \u2208 N.\nThe same is not true for a power 1/\u03bd with \u03bd \u2208 N: a crude way to\nsee this is to note that reflection positivity typically includes as necessary\nconditions inequalities among truncated Schwinger n-point functions SnT of\nthe general structure S4T \u2264 S2T S2T , while raising S[j] to a power p amounts\nto replace S T by p * S T .\nThis remark has a (trivial) consequence concerning the semiclassical\nlimit: let us reintroduce the unit of action ~ and rewrite\nZ\n1\n\u22121\nS[j] = Z\nD\u03c6 e\u2212 ~ I[j;\u03c6]\n(1.15)\nR\nwhere I[j; \u03c6] = I[\u03c6] \u2212 \u03c6j is the action in the presence of a source j.\nAppealing to the idea that when ~ is very small, the functional integral is\nsharply peaked around the classical minimum \u03c6s-cl = \u03c6s-cl [j] of this action,\nlet us replace ~ by ~/\u03bd and consider the limit \u03bd \u2192 \u221e. Then we may expect\n(up to irrelevant constants)\n\u0014Z\n\u00151/\u03bd\n\u03bd\n1\nD\u03c6 e\u2212 ~ I[j;\u03c6]\nSs-cl [j] := e\u2212 ~ I[j;\u03c6s-cl[j]] = lim\n.\n(1.16)\n\u03bd\u2192\u221e\n\nThis generating functional treated perturbatively, gives the tree level (semiclassical) approximation to the original one, all loop diagrams being suppressed by additional powers of ~/\u03bd.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n9\n\nThe functional integral in square brackets is \"as usual\" with ~/\u03bd in\nplace of ~, hence we may assume that it satisfies reflection positivity. But\nwe have no reason to expect Ss-cl [j] to be reflection-positive, because of\nthe presence of the power 1/\u03bd. Thus Ss-cl [j] does not generate reflectionpositive Schwinger functions, and hence no acceptable quantum field. This\nis, clearly, no surprise, because a classical field theory is not a quantum\nfield theory.\nA variant of this argument is less trivial, concerning the large N limit.\nIf one raises S[j] to some power N , the truncated Schwinger functions are\nmultiplied by the factor N , and diverge as N \u2192 \u221e. Rescaling the field by\n1\nN \u2212 2 stabilizes the 2-point function (assuming the 1-point function h\u03c6E i\nto vanish), but suppresses all higher truncated n-point functions, so that\nthe limit N \u2192 \u221e becomes Gaussian, i.e., one ends up with a free field. To\nevade this conclusion (the \"central limit theorem\"), one has to \"strengthen\"\nthe interaction at the same time to counteract the suppression of higher\ntruncated correlations. Let us consider S[j] of the functional integral form.\nRaising S to the power N , amounts to integrate over N independent\ncopies\nP\n. . D\u03c6N ) with interaction V (\u03c6) = i V (\u03c6i ) and\nof the field (D N \u03c6 = D\u03c61 .P\ncoupling to the source j * P \u03c6i . One way to strengthen\nP 2 2 the interaction is\n4\nto replace, e.g., V (\u03c6) = \u03bb i \u03c6i by V (\u03c6) = \u03bb( i \u03c6i ) giving rise to much\nmore interaction vertices, coupling the N previously decoupled copies of\nthe field among each other. At the same time, the action acquires an O(N )\nsymmetry, so one might wish to couple the sources\nP also only to O(N )\ninvariant fields, and replace the source term by j * \u03c62i , hence\nZ\nZ\n1\n2 2\nIN [j, \u03c6] = (\u03c6, A\u03c6) + \u03bb(\u03c6 ) + j * \u03c62 .\n(1.17)\n2\nWe call the resulting functional integral SN [j].\nAll these manipulations maintain the formal reflection positivity of\nSN [j] at any finite value of N . An inspection of the Feynman rules for the\nperturbative treatment shows that now all truncated n-point functions still\ncarry an explicit factor of N , and otherwise have a power series expansion\nin N and \u03bb where each term has less powers of N than of \u03bb. Introducing the\n't Hooft coupling \u03b8 = N \u03bb, this yields an expansion in \u03b8 and 1/N . Fixing\n\u03b8 and letting N \u2192 \u221e, suppresses the 1/N terms, so that the asymptotic\nbehaviour at large N is\nT\n\nSN [j] \u223c eN [S\u221e (\u03b8)+O(1/N )] .\n\n(1.18)\n\nTo obtain a finite non-Gaussian limit, one has to take\nT\n\nS\u221e [j] := lim SN [j]1/N = eS\u221e (\u03b8) .\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(1.19)\n\nBut this reintroduces the fatal power 1/N which destroys reflection positivity. According to Lesson 4, this means\nLesson 5. The large N limit of a QFT is not itself a QFT.\n\n\f10\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nIt is rather some classical field theory, for the same reason as before:\nnamely the explicit factor N combines with the tacit inverse unit of action\n1/~ in the exponent of (1.18) to the inverse of an \"effective\" unit of action\n~/N \u2192 0. What large N QFT has to say about QFT, is the (divergent)\nasymptotic behaviour of correlations as N gets large.\n\nLecture 2:\n2.1\n\nAdS-CFT\n\nA positivity puzzle\n\nThe AdS-CFT correspondence, which provides the generating functional\nfor conformally invariant Schwinger functions from a classical action I on\nAdS, was given by Witten [26] and Polyakov et al. [16] as a \"model\" for\nMaldacena's Conjecture. We shall discuss this formula in the light of the\nprevious discussions about QFT, in which it appears indeed rather puzzling.\nFirst, the formula is essentially classical, because it is supposed to capture only the infinite N limit of the Maldacena conjecture. Its general\nstructure is\nAdS\nAdS-CFT\n[j] := e\u2212I[\u03c6 [j]]\n(2.1)\nSs-cl\nwhere I[\u03c6AdS ] is an AdS-invariant action of a field on AdS, and \u03c6AdS [j] is\nthe (classical) minimum of the action I under the restriction that \u03c6AdS has\nprescribed boundary values j. More precisely, introducing the convenient\nPoincar\u00e9 coordinates (z > 0, \u03be \u2208 RD ) of Euclidean AdS such that the\nboundary z = 0 is identified with D-dimensional Euclidean space, it is\nrequired that the limit\n(\u2202\u03c6AdS )(\u03be) := lim z \u2212\u2206 \u03c6AdS (z, \u03be)\nz\u21920\n\n(2.2)\n\nexists, and coincides with a prescribed function j(\u03be).\nIt follows from the AdS-invariance of the action I[\u03c6AdS ] (and the assumed AdS-invariance of the functional measure) that the variational derivaAdS-CFT [j] with respect to the source j are conformally covariant\ntives of Ss-cl\nfunctions, more precisely, they transform like the correlation functions of a\nEuclidean conformal field of scaling dimension (\"weight\") \u2206. Thus, symmetry and covariance are automatic. But how about reflection positivity?\nTo shed light on this aspect [9], we appeal once more to the idea that\na functional integral is sharply peaked around the minimum of the action,\nwhen the unit of action becomes small, and rewrite S[j] as\nhZ\nh\ni i1/\u03bd\nAdS\nAdS-CFT\n[j] = lim\nSs-cl\nD\u03c6AdS e\u2212\u03bdI[\u03c6 ] * \u03b4 \u2202\u03c6AdS \u2212 j\n(2.3)\n\u03bd\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere a formal functional \u03b4-function restricts the integration to those field\nconfigurations whose boundary limit (2.2) exists and coincides with the\ngiven function j(\u03be). We see that \u03bd takes the role of the inverse unit of\naction 1/~ in (2.3), so that \u03bd \u2192 \u221e signals the classical nature of this limit,\nhence of the original formula.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n11\n\nNow, there are two obvious puzzles concerning formal reflection positivity of this generating functional. The first is the same which was discussed\nin Sect. 1.4, namely the presence of the inverse power 1/\u03bd, which arises\ndue to the classical nature of the formula. Even if the functional integral\nin square brackets were positive, this power most likely would spoil posiAdS-CFT can be\ntivity. (In fact, the correlation functions obtained from Ss-cl\nseen explicitly to have logarithmic rather than power-like short-distance\nsingularities, and hence manifestly violate positivity [19].)\nThe obvious cure (as it is of course also suggested in the original papers\n[26, 16]) is to interpret the AdS-CFT formula (2.1) only as a semiclassical\napproximation to the \"true\" (quantum) formula, and consider instead the\nquantum version\nZ\nE\nh\ni\nD R\nAdS\nAdS-CFT\n(\u03be)j(\u03be)\nd\u03be \u03c6AdS-CFT\nE\n\u2261S\n[j] := D\u03c6AdS e\u2212I[\u03c6 ] * \u03b4 \u2202\u03c6AdS \u2212 j\ne\n\n(2.4)\nas the generating functional of conformally invariant Schwinger functions\nof a Euclidean QFT on RD .\nBut the second puzzle remains: for this expression, the formal argument\nfor reflection positivity of functional integrals, presented in Sect. 1.3, fails:\nthat argument treats the exponential of the interaction part of the action\nas a field insertion in the functional integrand, and it was crucial that field\ninsertions \u03c6 in the functional integral amount to the same insertions of the\nrandom variable \u03c6E in the expectation value h. . .i, achieved by variational\nderivatives of the generating functional S with respect to the source j.\nBut this property (1.11) is not true for the AdS-CFT functional integral\n(2.4) where the coupling to the source is via a \u03b4-functional rather than an\nexponential!\nSo why should one expect that the quantum AdS-CFT generating functional satisfies reflection positivity, so as to be acceptable for a conformal\nQFT on the boundary? Surprisingly enough, explicit studies of AdS-CFT\nSchwinger functions, computing the operator product expansion coefficients\nof the 4-point function at tree level [19], show no signs of manifest positivity violation which could not be restored in the full quantum theory (i.e.,\nregarding the logarithmic behaviour as first order terms of the expansion\nof anomalous dimensions). Why is this so?\nAn answer is given [9] by a closer inspection of the Feynman rules\nwhich go with the functional \u03b4 function in the perturbative treatment of\nthe functional integral. For simplicity,\nwe consider a single scalar field with\nR\nquadratic Klein-Gordon action 12 \u03c6AdS (\u2212\u0003 + M 2 )\u03c6AdS and a polynomial\nself-interaction. As usual, the Feynman diagrams for truncated n-point\nSchwinger functions are connected diagrams with n exterior lines attached\nto the boundary points \u03bei , and with vertices according to the polynomial\ninteraction and internal lines connecting the vertices. Each vertex involves\nan integration over AdS. (For our considerations it is more convenient to\nwork in configuration space rather than in momentum space.) However, the\nimplementation of theRfunctional\n\u03b4-function, e.g., by the help of an auxiliary\nR\nAdS )(\u03be)\u2212j(\u03be))\nAdS\ni\nb(\u03be)((\u2202\u03c6\nfield: \u03b4(\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 j) = Db e\n, modifies the propagators.\nOne has the bulk-to-bulk propagator \u0393(z, \u03be; z \u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) connecting two vertices,\n\n\f12\n\nK.-H.

The latter satisfy reflection positivity by the formal argument\nof Sect. 1.3, generalized to AdS. Taking the joint boundary limit preserves\npositivity, because this step essentially means a choice of special smearing\nfunctions (1.8), supported on the boundary z = 0 only. Thus, (2.4) indeed\nsatisfies reflection positivity, in spite of its appearance.\nBecause the Wick rotation affecting the Minkowski coordinates commutes with the boundary limit in z, we conclude that the same relation\n(2.11) also holds for the Wightman functions, and hence for the reconstructed real-time quantum fields:\n\u03c6\u0302AdS-CFT (x) = c1 * (\u2202 \u03c6\u0302AdS )(x) \u2261 c1 * lim z \u2212\u2206+ \u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x),\nz\u21920\n\n(2.12)\n\nx \u2208 D-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This relation describes the restriction of an AdS covariant field to its timelike boundary [4], and generalizes the well-known fact that Poincar\u00e9 covariant quantum fields can be\nrestricted to timelike hypersurfaces, giving rise to quantum fields in lower\ndimensions, see Sect. 3.1. Moreover, because the AdS field (formally) satisfies reflection positivity, so does its boundary restriction.\nWe have established the identification (2.11), (2.12) for symmetric tensor fields of arbitrary rank [15] (with arbitrary polynomial couplings), see\nthe appendix. Although we have not considered antisymmetric tensors nor\nspinor fields, there is reason to believe that this remarkable conclusion is\ntrue in complete generality.\nLesson 6. Quantum fields defined by AdS-CFT are the boundary\nrestrictions (limits) of AdS fields quantized conventionally on the\nbulk (with the same classical action).\nWe want to mention that in the semiclassical approximation (2.1), one\nhas the freedom to partially integrate the classical quadratic action and\ndiscard boundary contributions, which are of course quadratic in j and\nhence contribute only to the tree level 2-point function. This ambiguity has\nbeen settled previously [12] by imposing Ward identities on the resulting\ncorrelation functions. The resulting normalization c2 of the tree level 2point function precisely matches the one obtained by the above functional\nmethod.\nLet us look at this from a different angle. Changing the tree level\n2-point function amounts to multiplication of the generating functional\nby a Gaussian. Thus, any different normalization would add (as in Sect.\n1.4) a Gaussian (free) field to the conformal Minkowski field \u2202 \u03c6\u0302AdS . Not\nsurprisingly, the sum would violate Ward identities which are satisfied by\nthe field without the extra Gaussian.\n\n\f14\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nLecture 3:\n\nBrane restrictions and AdS-CFT\n\nWe want to discuss the results obtained by formal reasoning in the previous\nlecture, in the light of exact results on QFT.\n\n3.1\n\nBrane restrictions\n\nQuantum fields may be restricted to timelike hypersurfaces [7]. This is a\nnon-trivial statement since they are distributions which become operators\nonly after smearing with smooth test functions, so it is not obvious that one\nmay fix one of the spacetime coordinates to some value. Indeed, t = 0 fields\nin general do not exist in interacting 4D theories. However, it is possible to\nfix one of the spacelike coordinates thanks to the energy positivity, by doing\nso in the analytically continued Wightman functions in the forward tube,\nwhich gives other analytic functions whose real-time limits Im (zi \u2212zi+1 ) \u0581\n0 exist as distributions in a spacetime of one space dimension less.\nThe restricted field inherits locality (in the induced causal structure of\nthe hypersurface), Hilbert space positivity (because the Hilbert space does\nnot change in the process), and covariance. However, only the subgroup\nwhich preserves the hypersurface may be expected to act geometrically on\nthe restricted field.\nThis result, originally derived for Minkowski spacetime [7], has been\ngeneralized to AdS in [3]. Here, the warped product structure implies that\neach restriction to a z = const. hypersurface (\"brane\") gives a Poincar\u00e9\ncovariant quantum field in Minkowski spacetime. One thus obtains a family\nof such fields, \u03c6\u0302z (x) := \u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x), defined on the same Hilbert space.\nMoreover, because spacelike separation in the Minkowski coordinates alone\nimplies spacelike separation in AdS, the fields of this family are mutually\nlocal among each other. Even more, \u03c6\u0302z (x) commute with \u03c6\u0302z \u2032 (x\u2032 ) also at\ntimelike distance provided (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc < (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 .\n\n3.2\n\nAdS \u2192 CFT as QFT on the limiting brane\n\nNow assume in addition that the Wightman distributions WnAdS of a (scalar)\nquantum field on AdS admit a finite limit\nY\n( lim zi\u2212\u2206 )WnAdS (z1 , x1 ; . . . ; zn , xn ) =: Wn (x1 , . . . , xn )\n(3.1)\nzi \u21920\n\nfor some value of \u2206. It was proven [4] that these limits define a (scalar)\nWightman field on Minkowski spacetime, which may be written as\n\u03c6\u0302(x) = (\u2202 \u03c6\u0302AdS )(x) \u2261 lim z \u2212\u2206 \u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x).\nz\u21920\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn addition to the usual structures, this field inherits conformal covariance\nfrom the AdS covariance of \u03c6\u0302AdS . It is an instructive exercise to see how\nthis emerges.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n15\n\nLet (z, x) 7\u2192 (z \u2032 , x\u2032 ) be an AdS transformation (which acts nonlinearly\nin these coordinates). This transformation takes (3.2) into\nlim z \u2212\u2206 \u03c6\u0302AdS (z \u2032 , x\u2032 ) = lim (z \u2032 /z)\u2206 * z \u2032\u2212\u2206 \u03c6\u0302AdS (z \u2032 , x\u2032 ).\n\nz\u21920\n\nz\u21920\n\nNow, because AdS transformations are isometries, the measure\n\u221a\nis invariant, where \u2212g = z \u2212D\u22121 .

In the same limit, \u2202z \u2032 /\u2202x\u03bc and \u2202x\u2032\u03bc /\u2202z tend to 0, and \u2202z \u2032 /\u2202z \u2248 z \u2032 /z.\nHence the Jacobian in (3.4) in that limit becomes\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u2032\u0013\n\u0013\n\u2202(z \u2032 , x\u2032 )\n\u2202x\nz\u2032\ndet\n\u2248 * det\n.\n(3.5)\n\u2202(z, x)\nz\n\u2202x\nHence, the factor (z \u2032 /z)\u2206 in (3.3) produces the correct conformal prefactors\n\u0010\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011\u0011 \u2206\nD\ndet \u2202x\nrequired in the transformation law for a scalar field of scaling\n\u2202x\ndimension \u2206.\nNone of the fields \u03c6\u0302z (z = const. 6= 0) is conformally covariant because\nits family parameter z sets a scale; hence the boundary limit may be reinterpreted as a scaling limit within a family of non-scale-invariant quantum\nfields.\nComparing the rigorous formula (3.2) with the conclusion (2.12) obtained by formal reasoning with unrenormalized perturbative Schwinger\nfunctions, we conclude\nLesson 7. The prescription for the AdS-CFT correspondence\ncoincides with a special instance of the general scheme of brane\nrestrictions, admitted in QFT.\n\n3.3\n\nAdS \u2190 CFT by holographic reconstruction\n\nIn view of the preceding discussion, the inverse direction AdS \u2190 CFT\namounts to the reconstruction of an entire family of Wightman fields \u03c6\u0302z\n(z \u2208 R+ ) from a single member \u03c6\u03020 = limz\u21920 z \u2206 \u03c6\u0302z of that family, with\nthe additional requirement that two members of the family commute at\nspacelike distance in AdS which involves the family parameters z, z \u2032 . This\nis certainly a formidable challenge, and will not always be possible. We\nfirst want to illustrate this in the case of a free field, and then turn to a\nmore abstract treatment of the problem in the general case.\nLet us consider [4, 10] a canonical Klein-Gordon field of mass M on\nAdS. The \"plane wave\" solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are the\nfunctions\n\u221a\nz D/2 J\u03bd (z k2 )e\u00b1ik*x ,\n(3.6)\n\n\f16\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\np\nwhere \u03bd = \u2206 \u2212 D/2 = D 2 /4 + M 2 , and the Minkowski momenta range\nover the entire forward lightcone V+ . It follows that the 2-point function is\nh\u03a9, \u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x)\u03c6\u0302AdS (z \u2032 , x\u2032 )\u03a9i \u223c\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032 D/2\n\u223c (zz )\ndD kJ\u03bd (z k2 )J\u03bd (z k2 )e\u2212ik(x\u2212x ) \u223c\nV+\nZ\n\u223c (zz \u2032 )D/2\ndm2 J\u03bd (zm)J\u03bd (z \u2032 m)Wm (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n\n(3.7)\n\nR+\n\n(ignoring irrelevant constants throughout), where Wm is the massive 2point function in D-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.\nRestricting to any fixed value of z, we obtain the family of fields \u03c6\u0302z (x)\nwhich are all different \"superpositions\" of massive Minkowski fields with\nK\u00e4llen-Lehmann weights d\u03bcz (m2 ) = dm2 J\u03bd (zm)2 . Such fields are known\nas \"generalized free fields\" [17]. Using the asymptotic behaviour of the\nBessel functions J\u03bd (u) \u223c u\u03bd at small u, the boundary field \u03c6\u03020 turns out to\nhave the K\u00e4llen-Lehmann weight d\u03bc0 (m2 ) \u223c m2\u03bd dm2 .\nIn order to reconstruct \u03c6\u0302z (x) from \u03c6\u03020 (x), one has to \"modulate\" its\nweight function, which can be achieved with the help of a pseudo-differential\noperator:\n\u03c6\u0302z (x) \u223c z \u2206 * j\u03bd (\u2212z 2 \u0003)\u03c6\u03020 (x)\n(3.8)\n\nwhere j\u03bd is the function j\u03bd (u2 ) = u\u2212\u03bd J\u03bd (u) on R+ . Note that the operators\nj\u03bd (\u2212z 2 \u0003) are highly non-local because j\u03bd (u) is not a polynomial, but they\nproduce a family of fields which all satisfy local commutativity with each\nother at spacelike Minkowski distance [10].\n(In fact, the same is true for any sufficient regular function h(\u2212\u0003),\ngiving rise to an abundance of mutually local fields on the same Hilbert\nspace. The trick can also be generalized to Wick products, by acting with\noperators of the form h(\u2212\u00031 , . . . , \u2212\u0003k )|x1 =***=xk . Moreover, although the\ngeneralized free field does not have a free Langrangean and consequently\nno canonical stress-energy tensor, it does possess a stress-energy tensor\nwithin this class of generalized Wick products, whose t = 0 integrals are\nthe generators of conformal transformations.)\nIn order to reconstruct a local field \u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x) on AdS which fulfils\nlocal commutativity with respect to the causal structure of AdS, Minkowski\nlocality is, however, not sufficient. A rather nontrivial integral identity for\nBessel functions guarantees that \u03c6\u0302z (x) and \u03c6\u0302z \u2032 (x\u2032 ) commute even at timelike\ndistance provided (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc (x \u2212 x\u2032 )\u03bc < (z \u2212 z \u2032 )2 . Only this ensures that\n\u03c6\u0302AdS (z, x) := \u03c6\u0302z (x) is a local AdS field.\nWe have seen that the reconstruction of a local AdS field from its boundary field is a rather nontrivial issue even in the case of a free field, and\nexploits properties of free fields which are not known how to generalize to\ninteracting fields.\nIn the general case, there is an alternative algebraic reconstruction [23]\nof local AdS observables, which is however rather abstract and does not\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n17\n\nensure that these observables are smeared fields in the Wightman sense.\nThis approach makes use of the global action of the conformal group on\nthe Dirac completion of Minkowski spacetime, and of a corresponding global\ncoordinatization of AdS (i.e., unlike most of our previous considerations, it\ndoes not work in a single Poincar\u00e9 chart (z, x)).\nThe global coordinates of AdS are\nX=(\n\n1\nsin \u03c1 ~\n~e,\nE)\ncos \u03c1 cos \u03c1\n\n(3.9)\n\n~ are a 2-dimensional and a D-dimensional unit\nwhere \u03c1 < \u03c02 and ~e and E\nvector, respectively. A parametrization of the universal covering of AdS\nis obtained by writing ~e = (cos \u03c4, sin \u03c4 ) and considering the timelike coordinate \u03c4 \u2208 R. Thus, AdS appears as a cylinder R \u00d7 B D . While the\nmetric diverges with an overall factor cos\u22122 \u03c1 with \u03c1 \u0580 \u03c02 as the boundary\nis reached, lightlike curves hit the boundary at a finite angle.\nThe boundary manifold has the structure of R \u00d7 S D\u22121 , which is the universal covering of the conformal Dirac completion of Minkowski spacetime.\nWe consider causally complete boundary regions K \u2282 R \u00d7 S D\u22121 , and\nassociate with them causally complete \"wedge\" regions W (K) \u2282 R \u00d7 B D ,\nwhich are the causal completion of K in the causal structure of the bulk. It\nthen follows that W (K1 ) and W (K2 ) are causal complements in the bulk\nof each other, or AdS transforms of each other, iff K1 and K2 are causal\ncomplements in the boundary of each other, or conformal transforms of\neach other, respectively.\nNow, we assume that a CFT on R \u00d7 S D\u22121 is given. We want to define\nan associated quantum field theory on AdS. Let A(K) be the algebras\ngenerated by CFT fields smeared in K. Then, by the preceding remarks,\nthe operators in A(K) have the exact properties as to be expected from AdS\nquantum observables localized in W (K), namely AdS local commutativity\nand covariance. AdS observables in compact regions O of AdS are localized\nin every wedge which contains O, hence it is consistent to define [23]\n\\\nA(K)\n(3.10)\nAAdS (O) :=\nW (K)\u2283O\n\nas the algebra of AdS observables localized in the region O. Because any two\ncompact regions at spacelike AdS distance belong to some complementary\npair of wedges, this definition in particular guarantees local commutativity.\nNote that this statement were not true, if only wedges within a Poincar\u00e9\nchart (z, x) were considered.\nLesson 8. Holographic AdS-CFT reconstruction is possible in\ngeneral without causality paradoxes, but requires a global treatment.\nThe only problem with this definition is that the intersection of algebras\nmight be trivial (in which case the QFT on AdS has only wedge-localized\n\n\f18\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nobservables). But when the conformal QFT on the boundary arises as the\nrestriction of a bulk theory, then we know that the intersection of algebras\n(3.10) contains the original bulk field smeared in the region O.\n\n3.4\n\nConformal perturbation theory via AdS-CFT\n\nAs we have seen, a Klein-Gordon field on AdS gives rise to a generalized\nfree conformal field. Perturbing the former by an interaction, will perturb\nthe latter. But perturbation theory of a generalized free field is difficult\nto renormalize, because there is a continuum of admissible counter terms\nassociated with the continuous K\u00e4llen-Lehmann mass distribution of the\ngeneralized free field.\nThis suggests to perform the renormalization on the bulk, and then\ntake the boundary limit of the renormalized AdS field. Preserving AdS\nsymmetry, drastically reduces the free renormalization parameters.\nThis program is presently studied [11]. Two observations are emerging:\nfirst, to assume the existence of the boundary limit of the remormalized\nAdS field constitutes a nontrivial additional renormalization condition; and\nsecond, the resulting renormalization scheme for the boundary field differs\nfrom the one one would have adopted from a purely boundary (Poincar\u00e9\ninvariant) point of view.\nWe do not enter into this in more detail [11]. Let us just point out\nthat this program can be successful only for very special interactions of the\nconformal field, which \"come from AdS\". To illustrate what this means, let\nus rewrite a typical interaction Lagrangean on AdS as an interaction of the\nconformal boundary field, using the results of Sect. 3.3:\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011k\n\u221a\nD\nk\n\u2212gdz d x \u03c6(z, x) = z \u2212D\u22121 dz dD x z \u2206 j\u03bd (\u2212z 2 \u0003)\u03c60 (x) =\n! k\nZ\nZ\nk\nY\nY\n\u03c60 (xi )|x1 =***=xk =x .

It is crucial that this operator gives a local field (i.e., when\napplied to the normal ordered product :\u03c6\u0302k0 : of the quantum generalized free\nfield, the resulting field L[\u03c6\u03020 ] satisfies local commutativity with respect to\n\u03c6\u03020 as well as with respect to the family \u03c6\u0302z and to itself), because otherwise\nthe interaction would spoil locality of the interacting field. In fact, L[\u03c6\u03020 ]\nbelongs to the class of generalized Wick products mentioned in Sect. 3.3.\nR\n\nA\n\nAppendix: AdS-CFT propagators\n\nBecause the chain of arguments leading to the Feynman rules for (2.4) and\nto the validity of (2.8) (which together ultimately lead to (2.11)) is some-\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n19\n\nwhat subtle [9], we give here a more detailed outline. Moreover, we present\nthe generalization to symmetric tensor fields which was not published before [15].\nThe AdS-CFT propagators \u0393, K, and \u03b2 in Sect. 2 are determined as\nfollows. First, we note that the Klein-Gordon equation dictates the zbehaviour of its solutions near the boundary to be proportional to z \u2206 where\n\u2206 is related to the Klein-Gordon mass by \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 D) = M 2 . There are thus\ntwo possible values\n\u221a\n\u2206\u00b1 = 12 (D \u00b1 D 2 + 4M 2 ),\n(A.1)\nand two Green functions G\u00b1 (z, \u03be; z \u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) [5] which go like (zz \u2032 )\u2206\u00b1 as z, z \u2032 \u2192\n0. G\u00b1 are hypergeometric functions of the Euclidean AdS distance. Choosing either G+ or G\u2212 as a \"bare\" propagator, may be considered as the definition of the Gaussian functional measure on which the perturbation series\nis based. However, the diagrammatic bulk-to-bulk propagator \u0393\u00b1 differs\nfrom the bare propagator due to the presence of the functional \u03b4 function.\nThis can be seen, e.g., by implementing\nthe \u03b4-function by the help of an\nR\nR\nAdS\nauxiliary field, \u03b4(\u2202\u03c6AdS \u2212 j) = Dbei b(\u03be)((\u2202\u03c6 )(\u03be)\u2212j(\u03be)) , which introduces\nadditional quadratic terms. \u0393\u00b1 should still be a Green function, but vanish faster than the bare propagator, which comes about as a \"Dirichlet\ncondition\" due to the prescribed boundary values in the functional integral. Because \u2206+ > \u2206\u2212 , only \u0393\u2212 exists (when the bare propagator is G\u2212 ),\nand coincides with G+ \u223c z \u2206+ . For the other choice of \u2206, the functional\n\u03b4-function cannot be defined.\nThe bulk-to-boundary propagator is of group-theoretic origin [8]. Namely, the isometry group of D + 1-dimensional Euclidean AdS and the conformal group of RD both coincide with SO(D + 1, 1). The solutions to the\nKlein-Gordon equation on AdS carry a representation of the AdS group.\nTaking the boundary limit (\u2202\u00b1 \u03c6\u00b1 )(\u03be) := limz\u21920 z \u2212\u2206\u00b1 \u03c6(z, \u03be) of the solutions with either power law, one obtains functions on RD which transform\nunder SO(D + 1, 1) like conformal fields of dimension \u2206. The bulk-toboundary propagator K\u00b1 (z, \u03be; \u03be \u2032 ) is now an intertwiner between these representations, i.e.,\nZ\n\u03c6\u00b1 (z, \u03be) = K\u00b1 (z, \u03be; \u03be \u2032 )f (x\u2032 )dD x\n(A.2)\nis a solution which transforms like a scalar field if f transforms like a conformal field of dimension \u2206\u00b1 . This property determines K\u00b1 to be proportional\nto\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2206 \u2213\nz\n\u2032\nK\u00b1 (z, \u03be; \u03be ) \u223c\n.\n(A.3)\nz 2 + |\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 |2\n\nThe absolute normalization of K\u00b1 is given by the requirement that the\nboundary limit (\u2202\u00b1 \u03c6\u00b1 )(\u03be) of (A.2) is again f (\u03be); in other words,\nlim z \u2212\u2206\u00b1 K\u00b1 (z, \u03be; \u03be \u2032 ) = \u03b4(\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 ).\n\nz\u21920\n\n(A.4)\n\n\f20\n\nK.-H.

Thus, only the bulk-to-boundary propagator\nK\u2212 exists, while K+ for the other choice of the Gaussian measure, like \u0393+ ,\nis ill defined.\nFinally, the tree level 2-point function \u03b2\u00b1 (\u03be, \u03be \u2032 ) is found to be\n\u03b2\u00b1 = \u2212\u03b1\u22121\n\u00b1\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u2032 G is the boundary limit in both variables of the bare\nwhere \u03b1\u00b1 = \u2202\u00b1 \u2202\u00b1\n\u00b1\nGreen function G\u00b1 .

A\nsimple scaling argument shows that these double boundary limits are proportional to |\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 |\u22122\u2206\u00b1 , and their inverses are\n\n\u03b2\u00b1 (\u03be, \u03be \u2032 ) \u223c |\u03be \u2212 \u03be \u2032 |\u22122\u2206\u2213 .\n\n(A.6)\n\nBy inspection of these explicit functions, one finds [2]\n\u0393\u2212 = G+ ,\n\n\u2032\nK\u2212 = c1 * \u2202+\nG+ ,\n\n\u2032\n\u03b2\u2212 = c2 * \u2202+ \u2202+\nG+\n\n(A.7)\n\nwith numerical constants c1 and c2 , to be determined below.\nAll the arguments given above for the scalar case generalize mutatis\nmutandis to the case of symmetric tensor fields of arbitrary rank [15]. For\ngroup-theoretical reasons, one always has\n\u2206+ + \u2206\u2212 = D.\n\n(A.8)\n\nNamely, for each tensor rank r, the covariant Klein-Gordon equation is in\nfact an eigenvalue equation [13] for the quadratic Casimir operator of the\nisometry group SO(D + 1, 1) of AdS, C = M 2 + r(r + D \u2212 1), while in the\nconformal interpretation of the same representation, C = \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 D) + r(r +\nD \u2212 2). Equating the two eigenvalues\n\u2206(\u2206 \u2212 D) = M 2 + r,\n\n(A.9)\n\none obtains two solutions \u2206\u00b1 related by (A.8).\n\u2032 G (the boundary limit of G ) are proportional\nThat K\u2212 and H+ = \u2202+\n+\n+\nto each other for any rank r,\nK\u2212 = c1 * H+ .\n\n(A.10)\n\nfollows because the intertwining property of K\u2212 and the definition of H+ as\na limit of a Green function lead to the same linear differential equations for\nboth functions, with the same symmetry and boundary conditions. More\nprecisely, both are \"bi-tensors\" (with AdS resp. Euclidean r-fold multiindices A and a) subject to the homogeneous conditions\n\u2022 AdS- and conformal covariance (with weight \u2206 = \u2206+ = the larger\nsolution of (A.9)) under simultaneous transformations of (z, \u03be) and\n\u03be \u2032 , entailing homogeneity in all variables.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n21\n\n\u2022 symmetry and vanishing trace both as an AdS and a Euclidean tensor.\n\n\u2022 vanishing covariant divergence D Ai XA;a = 0.\n\n\u2022 Klein-Gordon equation (\u2212D C DC + M 2 )XA;a = 0.\n\nThese conditions uniquely determine the structure\n#\n\" r\nY\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\nr\u2212\u2206\nXA;a (z, \u03be; \u03be ) = v\nDAi \u2202ai log v\n\u2212 contractions * \u03b4ai aj (A.11)\ni=1\n\nsymm\n\nup to normalization, hence (K\u2212 )A;a and (H+ )A;a are both multiples of XA;a .\n(For a sketch of the proof, see below; cf. also [8] for a group-theoretical\nderivation.)

Choosing the boundary components of this function of the form\nFa (z, \u03be) = z \u2206\u2212r fa (\u03be), and all z-components = 0, this condition reduces to\nZ\nZ\nr+\u2206\u2212D+1\nz\ndz d\u03be [\u2212\u0003fb (\u03be)](H+ )b;a (z, \u03be; \u03be \u2032 ) = fa (\u03be \u2032 )\n(A.14)\nfor any symmetric and traceless smearing function fa (\u03be).\nFrom this, we obtain the absolute normalizations of K\u2212 and H+ separately (see below), and then determine the relative coefficient in (A.10).\nWe find, universally for every tensor rank r = 0, 1, 2, . . .\nc1 (\u2206) = 2\u2206 \u2212 D.\n\n(A.15)\n\nFor the matching condition (2.8), we have to compute also c2 . This can\nbe done by a purely structural argument: Let H\u00b1 and \u03b1\u00b1 be the respective\n\n\f22\n\nK.-H. Rehren\n\nboundary limits of the Green functions G\u00b1 in one and in both variables.\nThen\n(A.16)\nK\u2212 = H\u2212 * \u03b1\u22121\n\u2212\nformally fulfills the required properties of the bulk-to-boundary propagator\nincluding the normalization conditon (A.4) or its generalization (A.13) that\nits boundary limit is the \u03b4-function. On the other hand, K\u2212 = c1 (\u2206+ )*H+ ,\nhence\nc1 (\u2206+ ) * H+ \u03b1\u2212 = H\u2212 .\n(A.17)\n\nIf we knew the analogous identity for the opposite signs,\nc\u03031 * H\u2212 \u03b1+ = H+ ,\n\n(A.18)\n\nthen we could conclude c1 c\u03031 *H\u2212 \u03b1+ = K\u2212 and, applying the boundary limit\n\u22121\nto both sides, c1 c\u03031 * \u03b1\u2212 \u03b1+ = \u03b4, hence \u03b1\u22121\n\u2212 = c1 c\u03031 * \u03b1+ . Because \u03b2\u2212 = \u2212\u03b1\u2212\n(see above), we would conclude c2 = \u2212c1 c\u03031 in (A.7).\nThe problem is, that the intergration in (A.18) is UV-divergent and has\nto be regularized. Using the fact that H\u00b1 and \u03b1\u00b1 are the values of analytic\nfunctions H(\u2206) and \u03b1(\u2206) at the points \u2206 = \u2206\u00b1 , and (A.17) is true in an\nopen region of the complex variable \u2206, we regularize (A.18) by analytic\ncontinuation from (A.17). This implies, that (A.18) is valid with c\u03031 the\nvalue of the analytic function c1 (\u2206) at the point \u2206\u2212 , and hence\nc2 = \u2212c1 (\u2206+ ) * c1 (\u2206\u2212 ).\n\n(A.19)\n\nThe matching condition (2.8) is thus equivalent to the symmetry\nc1 (\u2206+ ) + c1 (\u2206\u2212 ) = 0,\n\n(A.20)\n\nwhich is indeed satisfied by the function c1 = c1 (\u2206) in (A.15).\nAlthough we have not considered antisymmetric tensors nor spinor\nfields, the universality of (A.15) makes one believe that the remarkable\nconclusion (2.11), (2.12) is true in complete generality.\nLet us now turn to proving (A.11) and (A.15). The bi-tensor XA;a\nsatisfies the required covariance properties because v is given by the scaled\nlimit (A.12) of the invariant distance u. It is traceless as a Euclidean tensor\nby construction. Contracting with gAi Aj , the identities\n(DA v)(DA v) = v 2\n\nand\n\n(DA \u2202a\u2032 v)(DA \u2202b\u2032 v) = \u03b4ab + (\u2202a\u2032 v)(\u2202b\u2032 v)\n\n(A.21)\n\nimply that (D A \u2202a\u2032 log v)(DA \u2202b\u2032 log v) = \u03b4ab v \u22122 , so the contributions from\nthe displayed leading term in (A.11) cancel against the contractions because\nwe know that the whole is traceless as a Euclidean tensor. Hence XA;a is\nautomatically also traceless as an AdS tensor. Similarly, a covariant divergence of the displayed term of (A.11) involves terms (DA v)(DA \u2202a\u2032 log v)\nand D A DA \u2202a\u2032 log v which both vanish due to (A.21), as well as terms\n(DA DB \u2202b\u2032 log v)(DA \u2202a\u2032 log v) + (a \u2194 b) = DB (\u03b4ab v \u22122 ) which again cancel\nagainst the contractions.\n\n\fQFT lectures on AdS-CFT\n\n23\n\nComputing the covariant Laplacian DC DC acting on the displayed term\nof (A.11), one gets contributions involving either DC DC v r\u2212\u2206 or DC DC (DA\n\u2202a\u2032 log v) or (DC v r\u2212\u2206 )(DC DA \u2202a\u2032 log v) or (DC DA \u2202a\u2032 log v)(DC DB \u2202b\u2032 log v) +\n(a \u2194 b). Using (A.21) and the identity\nDA DB v = gAB * v,\n\n(A.22)\n\neach of these contributions turns out to be a multiple of the displayed term\nitself, the last one with an additional term involving \u03b4ab . The multiples sum\nup to \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 D) \u2212 r = M 2 . Hence, the Klein-Gordon equation is fulfilled\nup to terms involving \u03b4ab , which we know to cancel among each other as\nbefore. This proves the correctness of the structure (A.11).\nNow, in order to determine the absolute normalizations from (A.13) and\n(A.14), one only has to insert the structure XA;a and perform the integrals.\nThe contraction terms do not contribute. The crucial step is to rewrite one\nfactor z v 2\u2212r\u2212\u2206 (\u2202a \u2202b log v) appearing in each of these integrals, as\nr+\u2206\u22122 1\u2212r\u2212\u2206\n\u03b4ab\nr+\u2206\u22121 v\n\n+\n\n1\n1\u2212r\u2212\u2206 )\nr+\u2206\u22121 \u2202b (\u03bea v\n\nand then perform a partial integration with the second term. The contributions from the partial integration vanish by symmetry and tracelessness\nof the smearing functions, using the limit z \u2192 0 in the case of (A.13) and\nby the vanishing of the divergence in the case of (A.14). Hence in both\ncases the rank r integral is reduced to the corresponding rank r \u2212 1 integral\nwith an additional factor r+\u2206\u22122\nr+\u2206\u22121 \u03b4ab . Thus, the same factors enter the absolute normalizations upon passage from rank r \u2212 1 to r, leaving the relative\nnormalization independent of the rank. Thus (2.7) computed once for the\nscalar field, gives (A.15) for any rank.\n\nReferences\n[1] O. Aharony, S. S. Gubser, J. M. Maldacena, H. Ooguri and Y.
