Introduction\nSince Calabi-Yau threefolds were first identified as key geometries for superstring compactification to four dimensions [1], the classification of manifolds of this type has been widely\nstudied by string theorists and mathematicians (See [2] for an introduction to the subject.) It is still not known whether there are a finite number of distinct topological classes\nof Calabi-Yau threefolds, or if the Hodge numbers of such manifolds are bounded. Toric\ngeometry provides a powerful tool for describing certain classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds.\nUsing a construction of Batyrev [3], Kreuzer and Skarke [4] produced a comprehensive list\nof some 473.8 million examples of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds associated with fourdimensional reflexive polytopes. These examples include manifolds with 30,108 distinct\npairs of Hodge numbers. Graphed on a scatter plot, these Hodge numbers take the famous\n\"shield\" shape (Figure 1). While other classes of Calabi-Yau manifolds have since been\nconstructed (see for example [6, 7], [8] for a review), they give Hodge numbers that fit\nwithin this same general shape. The boundary of the set of allowed Hodge numbers has\nnot yet been explained in any systematic way.\nRecently, D. Morrison and the author used an alternative approach to construct a\nlarge class of Calabi-Yau threefolds [9, 10]. Motivated by F-theory considerations, we systematically analyzed the set of surfaces that can support elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds. These base surfaces are all connected in a complicated network through transitions associated with blowing up and down points in the surface. From the mathematics of\nthe minimal model program, all such bases (aside from the trivial example of the Enriques\nsurface, which is connected in a more complicated way) can be found by blowing up a\nseries of points on P2 or the Hirzebruch surfaces Fm [11, 12]. By analyzing the intersection\nstructure of irreducible effective divisors on the base surface, in [9] we identified specific\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fh11 + h21\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n-1000\n\n-500\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n\u03a7 \u0087 2 Hh11 - h21 L\n\nFigure 1: The 30,108 distinct Hodge numbers of the 473.8 million Calabi-Yau threefolds identified by\nKreuzer and Skarke. Data from [5].\n\ngeometric structures (\"non-Higgsable clusters\" of divisors) that characterize the geometry\nof elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular, in [10] we used this approach to\nconstruct all smooth toric bases that support elliptic fibrations with section where the total\nspace is a Calabi-Yau threefold. There are 61,539 such toric bases. While the approach\ntaken in [10] is also based in toric geometry, the analysis is simplified from that of work\nsuch as [4] by the focus on the geometry of the base. The analysis of [9] is also applicable\nto a systematic analysis of non-toric bases and Calabi-Yau threefolds.\nIn this paper we consider the Hodge structure of generic Calabi-Yau threefolds over\nthe 61,539 bases constructed in [10]. We find that the Hodge numbers h11 , h21 of these\nmanifolds are distributed throughout the \"shield\" region identified in [4]. The geometry\nof the base surfaces connects all these Calabi-Yau manifolds into a connected web, in\naccordance with the conjecture of Reid [13]. Furthermore, the structure of the bases gives a\nclear geometric understanding of the outer boundary of the shield region. The top boundary\nof the region of known allowed Hodge numbers roughly follows a specific trajectory of blowups of the base F12 that terminates in the Calabi-Yau associated with the F-theory model\nhaving the largest gauge group among models in this class. Although the analysis in this\npaper focuses on generic elliptic fibrations over toric bases, a much larger class of elliptically\nfibered Calabi-Yau manifolds can be realized by tuning Weierstrass moduli, as in F-theory\nconstructions, to produce singular elliptic fibrations that are then resolved. Again, though\nwe focus primarily here on toric bases, the methods of [9] suggest that similar results may\nhold for elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds over non-toric bases.\nIn Section 2 we describe the Hodge structure of the generic elliptic fibrations over the\nbases identified in [10]. We characterize the bounds on the region of allowed Hodge numbers\nin Section 3. In Section 4 we make some brief comments on extensions of this analysis to\nnon-generic elliptic fibrations, non-toric bases, and non-elliptically fibered threefolds.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fCluster\n(-12)\n(-8)\n(-7)\n(-6)\n(-5)\n(-4)\n(-3, -2, -2)\n(-3, -2)\n(-3)\n(-2, -3, -2)\n(-2, -3)\n(-2, -2, -3)\n(-2, -2, . . . , -2)\n\ngauge algebra\ne8\ne7\ne7\ne6\nf4\nso(8)\ng2 \u2295 su(2)\ng2 \u2295 su(2)\nsu(3)\nsu(2) \u2295 so(7) \u2295 su(2)\ng2 \u2295 su(2)\ng2 \u2295 su(2)\nno gauge group\n\nHcharged\n0\n0\n28\n0\n0\n0\n8\n8\n0\n16\n8\n8\n0\n\nPossible connected clusters\n(-2, -2, -3) or below\n(-2, -3, -2) or below\n(-2, -3, -2) or below\n(-3) or below\n(-3, -2, -2) or below\n(-4) or below\nany cluster\n(-8) or below\n(-6) or below\n(-8) or below\n(-5) or below\n(-5) or below\nany cluster\n\nTable 1: Allowed clusters and connections between clusters by \u22121 curves in a toric surface that can be\nused as the base of an elliptic fibration. For each cluster, the table indicates the resulting contribution to\nthe gauge algebra, the charged matter content, and the set of clusters that can follow the first cluster after a\n\u22121 curve, where \"or below\" refers to the order of clusters in this table. Note that the clusters (\u22123, \u22122, \u22122)\nand (\u22123, \u22122) are ordered; for example, a \u221212 can be connected by a \u22121 curve to the final \u22122 of the cluster\n(\u22123, \u22122, \u22122) but not to the \u22123 curve. For clarity these clusters are listed in both directions.\n\n2. Hodge structure\nIn [9, 10] we classified the 61,539 smooth toric compact complex surfaces that can support\nan elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold. We do not repeat the analyses of those papers\nhere, but follow the notation of those papers and briefly summarize some of the salient\nresults here. Each toric base is described by a fan associated with a closed loop of k divisors D1 , . . . Dk with self-intersection Di * Di = \u2212ni and nonvanishing intersection between\nadjacent divisors Di * Di+1 = Dk * D1 = 1. The sequence of self-intersection numbers can\nonly contain specific subsequences (\"clusters\") of self-intersections \u22122 or below. Only certain combinations of clusters can be connected by \u22121 curves; a list of allowed clusters and\nconnections appears in Table 1\nThe allowed toric base surfaces are all realized by blowing up a succession of points\non either P2 or Fm , m \u2264 12. Some of the 61,539 bases are not strictly toric in that they\narise from toric bases with curves of self-intersection \u22129, \u221210, or \u221211 that are blown up at\nnon-toric points to give \u221212 curves, but these bases have very similar behavior to the true\ntoric bases and we include these in the class of toric bases for the purposes of this paper.\nIn [10], the toric bases were analyzed in the context of F-theory [14, 15, 12] compactifications to 6 dimensions. Though the results that we describe here for elliptically fibered\nCalabi-Yau manifolds are independent of the physics of F-theory, the tools and perspective provided by F-theory and the minimal model program for classification of surfaces are\nvery helpful in illuminating the structure of these elliptic fibrations. In the six-dimensional\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fsupergravity theory produced by an F-theory compactification on an elliptically fibered\nCalabi-Yau threefold, gravitational anomaly cancellation relates the numbers of tensor,\nvector, and hypermultiplet fields in the 6D theory through [16, 17, 18] (see [19] for a review\nof 6D supergravity theories, anomalies, and F-theory compactifications).\nH \u2212 V = 273 \u2212 29T .\n\n(2.1)\n\nFor each base, the numbers of these types of fields, as well as the rank r of the gauge group\nare determined from the toric data. In particular, T = k \u2212 3, where k is the number of\ncurves in the fan of the base, and the number of neutral hypermultiplets is related to the\nnumber of Weierstrass monomials, after taking proper account of automorphisms of the\nbase and degrees of freedom associated with \u22122 curves not carrying a gauge group. The\ngauge group and charged matter content are determined by the set of clusters as described\nin Table 1, with for example a single \u221212 curve corresponding to an e8 component in the\ngauge algebra. The toric data also allows for a determination of the Hodge numbers h11 , h21\nof the generic elliptically fibered threefold X over each base B, where\nh11 (X) = r + T + 2 = r + k \u2212 1\n\n(2.2)\n\nh21 (X) = Hneutral \u2212 1 = 272 + V \u2212 29T \u2212 Hcharged .\n\n(2.3)\n\nand\nin terms of the fields in the corresponding supergravity model from F-theory.\nThe 7524 distinct Hodge number combinations for the elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds over the 61,539 toric bases are plotted in Figure 2. These Hodge numbers exhibit\nthe same \"shield\" pattern seen in the Kreuzer and Skarke data. In fact, the Hodge data\nfrom toric bases is a proper subset of the set of Hodge numbers from the Kreuzer and Skarke\nlist. It is not surprising that the generic elliptic fibrations over toric bases all appear in the\nKreuzer and Skarke list. What is perhaps more surprising is that the smaller list from the\nset of toric bases extends through the same general range of Hodge numbers realized on\nthe larger list, and in particular contains all of the larger combinations of Hodge numbers\nnear the upper limits of the range found by Kreuzer and Skarke. The list of threefolds from\ntoric bases does not extend as close to the origin, however, in the region of small Hodge\nnumbers. Note that while the Hodge number pairs appearing in the Kreuzer and Skarke\nlist are invariant under mirror symmetry, which exchanges h11 , h21 , the Hodge numbers\nfor fibrations over toric bases do not have this symmetry. In many cases there are several\ndistinct families of Calabi-Yau manifolds in Kreuzer and Skarke's list that have a given\nset of Hodge numbers. The fibration structure of these manifolds can be analyzed, for\nexample by using the PALP software package [20], to identify which toric hypersurface\nmodel corresponds to a fibration over a given toric base.\nAs mentioned above, all 61,539 of the Calabi-Yau threefolds constructed in this fashion\nare connected through extremal transitions associated with blowing up and down points\non the base. In F-theory these transitions are associated with tensionless string transitions\n[21, 12]. The number of blow-ups from P2 , or one less than the number of blow-ups from Fm\ncorresponds to the number of tensor multiplets T in the corresponding F-theory model.

Plot axes are Hodge numbers h11 , h21 . Kreuzer-Skarke Hodge pairs\nare shown in background in light gray for comparison.\n\nparameter T = k\u22123 is useful in characterizing the complexity of the base. The models with\nT = 0, 1 are P2 and the Hirzebruch surfaces, and all lie on the left-hand side of the diagram,\nranging from F0 , F1 , and F2 , which all have Hodge numbers (h11 , h21 ) = (3, 243), and P2\nwith Hodge numbers (2, 272) to F12 with Hodge numbers (11, 491). As more points are\nblown up, T increases, as does the rank of the gauge group, so h11 monotonically increases.\nAt the same time, h21 monotonically decreases along any blow-up sequence. The change\nin h21 denotes the number of free parameters that must be tuned in the Weierstrass model\nover a given base to effect a blow-up. Note that the monotonic increase in h11 and decrease\nin h21 is true for any sequence of blow-up operations on the base, whether or not the base\nis toric.\n\n3. Bounds\nThe shape of the upper bound on Hodge numbers in the \"shield\" configuration has been\nnoted in previous work, but, as far as the author of this paper knows, never explained.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fFrom the point of view of elliptic fibrations over toric bases, however, the upper boundary\non allowed Hodge numbers has a simple and relatively clear interpretation.\nWe begin by considering the elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with the largest\nvalues of h21 . Since h21 decreases with any blow-up of the base (toric or not), the largest\nvalues of this parameter will appear for bases with a minimal value of T . These are the\nHirzebruch surfaces Fm , which (except for F1 ) do not contain \u22121 curves that can be further\nblown down. From (2.3) it is clear that the largest value of h21 will appear when the gauge\ngroup is largest. This occurs for the base F12 , where the Hodge numbers associated with the\ncorresponding Calabi-Yau threefold are (11, 491), since the non-Higgsable gauge algebra in\nthe corresponding 6D F-theory model is e8 with V = 248, and there is no charged matter.\nThis gives a rigorous bound h21 \u2264 491 for any Calabi-Yau threefold that admits an elliptic\nfibration (independent of whether the base is toric). Indeed, (11, 491) is the Hodge number\npair with the largest value of h21 in both the toric base and Kreuzer-Skarke lists, suggesting\nthat this bound may hold even outside the class of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds.\nGoing to the other corner of the allowed region, we consider threefolds with the largest\nvalues of h11 . As described in [10], the largest value of T arising from a threefold associated\nwith a toric base is T = 193. The associated 6D gravity theory has a gauge algebra\ncontaining 17 e8 summands, 16 f4 summands, and 32 g2 \u2295 su(2) summands, and was\noriginally identified in [22, 23]. The chain of self-intersections of the divisors in the toric\nbase is essentially 16 repeated copies of the pattern\n. . . , \u221212, \u22121, \u22122, \u22122, \u22123, \u22121, \u22125, \u22121, \u22123, \u22122, \u22122, \u22121, \u221212, . . .\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith a 0 self-intersection curve connecting to the two ends. The actual toric base has \u221211's\nin the next-to-last positions on each side that must be blown up at additional non-toric\npoints, as discussed in [10]. We denote this sequence by the shorthand\n(\u221212//\u221211//(\u221212)13 //\u221211//\u221212, 0)\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere the double slash denotes a connection between the adjacent curves by the sequence\nof curves connecting the two \u221212's in the pattern (3.1), and (\u221212)13 indicates 13 12's\nconnected by 12 copies of this pattern. The Hodge numbers associated with the generic\nthreefold over this surface are (491, 11), so this Calabi-Yau manifold should be related to\nthe generic threefold over F12 by mirror symmetry, as noted in [22]. The maximum value\nof h11 = 491 is compatible with mirror symmetry and the bound h21 \u2264 491 given above\nfor elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds.\nNow, we consider the shape of the upper boundary of the shield region, which in\nFigure 2 describes the maximum value of h21 that can be realized as a function of h11 . For\nthreefolds over toric bases, the sequence of extreme values along this curve are determined\nin a simple way by the sequence of blow-ups, starting from the base F12 , that maximize the\nincrease in h11 as h21 decreases, culminating in the base (3.2). In the F-theory picture, this\ntrajectory is followed by increasing the dimension of the gauge group (minus the number\nof charged matter fields) as quickly as possible when blowing up points on the base. In\nsituations not involving an increase in the gauge group or change in matter content, a\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fblow-up on the base trades 29 neutral hypermultiplet moduli for one tensor multiplet, as\ncan be seen from (2.1). For example, blowing up one, two, three, or four toric points on\nthe base F12 cannot produce a new gauge group or matter and must lead to changes in the\nHodge numbers of \u2206h11 = +1, \u2206h21 = \u221229. Some of the configurations in the sequence\nof toric bases realized by blowing up points on F12 are listed in Table 1, along with the\nresulting Hodge numbers. For the first four blow-ups, there is no way to increase the gauge\ngroup, so h21 drops by 29 for each blow-up and h11 increases by one. The first three pairs\nof Hodge numbers (11, 491), (12, 462), and (13, 433) in this sequence have the largest values\nof h21 not only in the toric base data set but also in the Kreuzer and Skarke data set\n(Figure 3). This explains the slope of \u221229 of the outer curve of the bounding region at the\ntip. Note that there are two distinct toric constructions in the Kreuzer and Skarke data\nset with Hodge numbers (12, 462), and four with (13, 433). Using PALP, it is easy to check\nthat, for example, one of the (12, 462) cases corresponds to a non-generic elliptic fibration\nover F12 as expected. On the fifth blow-up, it is possible to produce a base associated with\na gauge group g2 \u2295 su(2) and non-Higgsable matter. This gives a threefold with Hodge\nnumbers (19, 355). At this point the slope of the bounding curve becomes less steep, as\nfurther gauge groups can be added with additional blow-ups.\nFrom the threefold with Hodge numbers (13, 433) there is a chain of threefolds over\ntoric bases that roughly follows the upper boundary of the region of allowed Hodge numbers\nin the Kreuzer-Skarke database between h11 = 13 and h11 = 150. The bases associated\nwith these threefolds are realized by further blow-ups of F12 that maximize the size of\nthe gauge group (with matter subtracted). Note that in this range the threefolds with\ntoric bases are not uniformly at the absolute boundary of the allowed region. The KreuzerSkarke database includes some Hodge pairs that are slightly above those realized by generic\nthreefolds over toric bases in this region. For example, the Kreuzer-Skarke data includes\na threefold with Hodge numbers (14, 416) though no toric base gives a generic threefold\nwith these Hodge numbers (though (416, 14) does appear in the toric base data, which is\nnot mirror symmetric). We return to this example in Section 4.1\nNear the region of the central peak in the \"shield,\" the data from generic threefolds over\ntoric bases again contains all the Hodge pairs realized in the Kreuzer-Skarke database (see\nFigure 4). In particular, for h11 > 160 and h21 > 180, all the points on the upper boundary\nof the region are realized by the sequence of blow-ups of F12 mentioned above. Part of this\nsequence of bases is given in Table 2, where two separate sequences of blow-ups connect\nthe bases with T = 60, 65, 75 and T = 60, 64, 75. Note that the bases in the sequence\nwith T = 64, 75, 86, 97 are connected in order by combinations of 11 blow-ups at each\nstage. When, for example, the point at the intersection of the \u221210 and following \u22121 curves\nis blown up in the base with T = 75, the sequence becomes \u221211, \u22121, \u22122, \u22122, \u22122, \u22123, . . ..\nAs discussed in [9] this base does not support an elliptic fibration, the point between the\n\u22122 and \u22123 curves leaves the Kodaira classification and must be blown up, leading to\nfurther blow-ups. In the toric language this is easy to see from the dual polytope to the\ntoric fan, as discussed in [10]; the additional blow-ups are along curves where sections\nf \u2208 \u22124K, g \u2208 \u22126K must vanish to degrees 4, 6 once the first blow up is performed. The\n\"point\" of the central peak is associated with Hodge numbers (251, 251).

Large (blue) dots represent generic threefolds over toric bases, small (gray) dots are from\nKreuzer-Skarke list. Dots connected with a solid line represent the line of toric bases connected by blow-up\ntransitions closest to the shield boundary. Dotted line and mid-size (red) dot represents a threefold realized\nby tuning a Weierstrass model over the toric base corresponding to Hodge numbers (13, 433). (Many other\nHodge pairs from the Kreuzer-Skarke list can be realized in a similar fashion by tuning Weierstrass moduli,\nthough only one example is depicted.)\n\ntoric base has self-intersections (\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)7 , 0, 6), and, as for F12 , the next few\nblow ups cannot increase the gauge group so decrease h21 by 29 while increasing h11 by\n1. It is interesting to note that these apparently very different geometric steps - blowing\nup 11 points simultaneously in the bases with Hodge numbers (164, 254), . . . , (222, 252),\nand blowing down single curves in the bases with Hodge numbers (252, 222), . . . , (254, 164)\n- are dual through mirror symmetry1 . Understanding the relationship between these\ntransitions may give some new insights into mirror symmetry.\nContinuing down the chain, after several blow-ups the gradient again becomes less\nsteep, leading to a final sequence of bases carrying elliptically fibered threefolds with maximal values of h11 . Again, the sequence is the mirror image of the initial descent with\ngradient \u221229, and involves 11 blow ups at each of the final steps.\n1\n\nThough as mentioned above the toric base data does not necessarily give mirror symmetric Calabi-Yau\nconstructions, the corresponding geometries in the Kreuzer and Skarke database can be identified from the\nHodge numbers and polytope sizes, and are mirror symmetric.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fT\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n..\n.\n\ncurve self-intersection numbers\n(-12, 0, 12, 0)\n(-12, -1, -1, 11, 0)\n(-12, -1, -2, -1, 10, 0)\n(-12, -1, -2, -2, -1, 9, 0)\n(-12, -1, -2, -2, -2, -1, 8, 0)\n(-12, -1, -2, -2, -3, -1, -2, 8, 0)\n..\n.\n\nh11 , h21\n(11, 491)\n(12, 462)\n(13, 433)\n(14, 404)\n(15, 375)\n(19, 355)\n..\n.\n\n60\n64\n65\n\n(159, 255)\n(164, 254)\n(176, 254)\n\n75\n86\n97\n98\n99\n100\n..\n.\n\n(\u22128, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u22121, \u22125, \u22121, \u22123, \u22122, \u22122, \u22121, \u221211//124 , 0, 6)\n(9//11//124 , 0, 6)\n(\u22128, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, \u22128, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u22121, \u22125,\n\u22121, \u22123, \u22122, \u22122, \u22121, (\u221212)5 , 0, 6)\n(\u221210// \u2212 11//(\u221212)5 , 0, 6)\n(\u221211// \u2212 11//(\u221212)6 , 0, 6)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)7 , 0, 6)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)7 , \u22121, \u22121, 5)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)7 , \u22121, \u22122, \u22121, 4)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)7 , \u22121, \u22122, \u22122, \u22121, 3)\n..\n.\n\n171\n182\n193\n\n(\u221211// \u2212 11//(\u221212)11 // \u2212 11// \u2212 11, 0)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)12 // \u2212 11// \u2212 11, 0)\n(\u221212// \u2212 11//(\u221212)13 // \u2212 11// \u2212 12, 0)\n\n(433, 13)\n(462, 12)\n(491, 11)\n\n(193, 253)\n(222, 252)\n(251, 251)\n(252, 222)\n(253, 193)\n(254, 164)\n..\n.\n\nTable 2: Some of the toric bases that arise in the sequence of blow-ups from F12 to the maximal model with\nT = 193, and the Hodge numbers of the generic elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold over these bases.\nThis sequence of threefolds runs along the upper boundary of the \"shield\" region of known Calabi-Yau\nthreefold Hodge numbers.\n\n4. Extensions\n4.1 Tuning models over toric bases\nThe threefolds we have considered here are the generic Weierstrass models over each toric\nbase. This gives only a very small fraction of the full set of threefolds that can be realized\nas elliptic fibrations over toric bases. As has been widely studied in the context of Ftheory, by tuning the Weierstrass coefficients over any given base the degree of vanishing\nof the discriminant over given curves can be enhanced. This produces a singular elliptic\nfibration that must be resolved to get a smooth Calabi-Yau. In the F-theory picture, these\nsingularities in the discriminant locus give rise to nonabelian gauge group factors in the\n6D supergravity theory that can be identified through the Kodaira classification and the\nTate algorithm [24, 12, 25, 26, 27]. In [10] we gave an explicit description of the basis of\nmonomials for Weierstrass models over any of the 61,539 toric bases. In general, from the\nF-theory point of view tuning monomials to get a higher degree of vanishing of f, g over a\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fh21\n\n260\n\n240\n\n220\n\n200\n\n180\n\n160\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\nh11\n\nFigure 4: The region around the central point of the \"shield\" region of known allowed Hodge numbers\nfor Calabi-Yau threefolds. Large (blue) dots represent generic threefolds over toric bases, small (gray) dots\nare from Kreuzer-Skarke list. Dots connected with a solid line represent the line of toric bases connected\nby blow-up transitions closest to the shield boundary.\n\ngiven curve will also give rise to charged matter fields associated with the intersection of\nthat curve with other curves and with the rest of the discriminant locus [25, 28, 29].\nFor the Hodge numbers of the smooth resolved Calabi-Yau, the effect of tuning Weierstrass moduli to enhance the vanishing of the discriminant locus over certain curves decreases h21 . The appearance of gauge groups in the corresponding F-theory model increases\nh11 , and the appearance of matter decreases h21 further. Thus, for each of the 61,539 generic\nCalabi-Yau threefolds discussed in the main part of this paper there is a large family of\nadditional threefolds with larger h11 and smaller h21 . Anomaly cancellation conditions\nin 6D supergravity strongly constrain the combinations of gauge groups and matter content that can be realized for F-theory models associated with elliptic fibrations over any\ngiven base [30, 31, 32]. In particular, the number of moduli available in h21 provides a\nbound on the complexity of the models that can be realized over any given base through\n(2.3). In [33], it was conjectured that by tuning Weierstrass moduli any combination of\ngauge groups over specific divisors and matter content compatible with anomaly cancellation conditions could be realized in F-theory, up to the limit imposed by the number of\ndegrees of freedom in neutral hypermultiplets (h21 ). We are not aware of any exceptions\nto this conjecture at this time. A systematic study of F-theory models produced by tuning\nWeierstrass coefficients in this way to produce SU (N ) gauge groups was carried out over\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fHirzebruch bases Fm , m = 0, 1, 2 in [33], and over P2 in [34]. A systematic analysis of the\nT = 0 6D supergravity theories corresponding to models over P2 with SU (N ) gauge groups\nwas carried out in [35], and the possible matter representations compatible with anomaly\ncancellation were identified in this case. In general, there is no systematic classification of\ncodimension two singularities in F-theory models corresponding to different matter representations [34, 36, 37]. Braun has systematically identified some 100,000 toric hypersurface\nCalabi-Yau threefolds in the Kreuzer-Skarke database that are elliptic fibrations over P2\n[38]. These include many of the SU (N ) models studied in [35, 34], as well as a wide range\nof other models.\nIn principle, it should be possible to systematically construct a tremendous number of\ndifferent elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds by tuning Weierstrass moduli to achieve\ndifferent F-theory models over the 61,539 toric bases. The Hodge numbers of these threefolds can easily be computed through (2.2) and (2.3). It is possible that many of these\nthreefolds will not have a construction through the Batyrev method and will not be contained in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. On the other hand, because of the Hodge number\nstructure and reduction in h21 when tuning moduli, these models are likely to lie within\nthe shield region.\nA full exploration of Calabi-Yau threefolds associated with these tuned Weierstrass\nmodels is left for future work, but we mention a few specific examples here. In [33] we\ncarried out an explicit construction of F-theory models on Fm for small values of m with\nSU (N ) gauge groups on the divisor \u03a3 having self-intersection \u03a3 * \u03a3 = \u2212m, and explicitly\ncomputed the degrees of freedom used in this construction. The simplest class of cases\nare SU (N ) models on F2 . Tuning the Weierstrass model to realize this gauge group on \u03a3\nrequires fixing N 2 \u2212 1 moduli, and from anomaly considerations there must be 2N charged\nhypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of SU (N ). The Hodge numbers for the\nresolved elliptically fibered threefolds in these cases are then (2+ N, 242\u2212 N 2 ). While most\nof these Hodge pairs do not appear in the spectrum associated with toric bases, they appear\nin the Kreuzer-Skarke data up to N = 15, which is precisely the upper limit expected from\nanomaly conditions [33]. It is natural to expect that these models in the Kreuzer-Skarke\ndatabase are the resolved elliptic fibrations over F2 with enhanced gauge symmetry in the\nF-theory picture, since the Hodge numbers are relatively sparse in that region. In fact,\n(4, 238) (the N = 2 case) is the point with h11 = 4 having the largest value of h21 , and\n(5, 233) (the N = 3 case) has the largest h21 for h11 = 5 aside from the (5, 251) point\nassociated with F3 . Direct computation with PALP confirms that, for example, the unique\nexample with Hodge numbers (4, 238) is a tuned Weierstrass model over the base F2 .\nAnother simple class of tuned Weierstrass models with SU (N ) gauge groups are those\nassociated with elliptic fibrations over P2 , where the SU (N ) is realized over a degree\none curve. These models were constructed from the supergravity and F-theory points\nof view in [35, 34]. The corresponding resolved Calabi-Yau threefolds have (h11 , h21 ) =\n(1 + N, 271 \u2212 N (45 \u2212 N )/2) for N \u2265 3, and (3, 231) for N = 2. These Hodge numbers\nappear in the Kreuzer-Skarke database for N from 2 up to the maximum expected of\n24. These models were identified in the Kreuzer-Skarke data by Braun [39], who has\nexplicitly analyzed the corresponding toric models and determined that many of them have\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fa fibration structure matching precisely with the resolved Calabi-Yau manifolds associated\nwith enhanced symmetry on P2 bases.\nFinally, we can use the appearance of enhanced symmetry with tuning of moduli\nto explain some of the points in the Kreuzer-Skarke database that lie slightly above the\ntrajectory of generic threefolds over toric bases described in the previous section. While\nin general tuning moduli leads to a decrease in h21 that keeps the Hodge data below this\ncurve, near the boundary there are cases when tuning a small gauge group gives a larger\nvalue of h21 . One place where such configurations are easy to identify is in the regions\nwhere the gradient of the shield boundary is steepest. This occurs, for example, near the\npoint (11, 491) associated with the F12 base, where the gradient is \u221229. Tuning a gauge\ngroup on the +12 curve on F12 produces large amounts of charged matter, and cannot\ngive points near the boundary. There are also no single blow-ups of F12 that can be\ntuned to give models with enhanced gauge symmetry and large h21 . Blowing up F12 twice,\nhowever, gives the toric base described by the sequence of curves with self-intersections\n(\u221212, \u22121, \u22122, \u22121, 10, 0); the generic threefold over this base has Hodge numbers (13, 433).\nA gauge group SU (2) on the second \u22121 curve in the F-theory picture can be shown to\nhave 10 fundamental matter representations, so that the resolved Calabi-Yau has Hodge\nnumbers (14, 416). This is precisely the first point observed above in the Kreuzer-Skarke\ndata that lies above the trajectory of maximal blow-ups of F12 roughly outlining the upper\nboundary of the Hodge shield, as shown in Figure 3.\nAll of the tuned models just described involve gauge groups on toric divisors on the\nbases in the F-theory picture. There are also more complicated ways of tuning a gauge\ngroup. For example, as analyzed in [35, 34] for elliptic fibrations over the base P2 , gauge\ngroups can be tuned over a divisor described by a degree b curve in the base. As b increases, the possible matter representations become more exotic, and the complexity of\nthe corresponding resolved Calabi-Yau threefolds grows. For example, for b = 2 the\nmost generic model with an SU (N ) gauge group has 48 \u2212 4N fundamental and 6 antisymmetric representations. The Hodge numbers for the corresponding threefolds will be\n(1+ N, 271+ 2N 2 \u2212 45N ). Again, these numbers appear in the Kreuzer-Skarke database for\nN from 3 up to (and beyond) the expected bound of 12. Because this is a fairly populated\nregion, without further analysis it is unclear whether the corresponding Calabi-Yau's are\nthe associated elliptic fibrations; it would be interesting to understand these and related\nmodels further. In general the Calabi-Yau threefolds arising from tuning gauge groups over\nnon-toric divisors may have no convenient toric description, and may not appear in the\nKreuzer-Skarke list. As another example, from anomaly analysis it seems that there should\nbe a 6D model possible over P2 with gauge group SU (4), 64 fundamental matter fields,\nand one matter field in the 20 \"box\" representation [35]. No F-theory model is known\nfor this type of matter representation, which would correspond to an exotic codimension\ntwo singularity on a singular divisor of degree b = 4. An F-theory model of this type\nwould correspond to a resolved Calabi-Yau with Hodge numbers smaller than any that\nappear in the Kreuzer-Skarke database - the smallest Hodge numbers that appear there\nare (14, 14). So either this model cannot be realized in F-theory, or it is a representative\nof a class of Calabi-Yau threefolds not in the Kreuzer-Skarke list. In addition to exotic\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fmatter representations for nonabelian gauge groups, it is also possible to tune the generic\nWeierstrass model over a given base to get extra sections in the elliptic fibration enhancing\nthe rank of the Mordell-Weil group. In the F-theory picture this produces additional U (1)\ngauge group factors that contribute to h11 [12]. Since these factors are nonlocal, they are\nmore difficult to describe in F-theory (and less constrained by 6D anomalies [40]), though\nsome classes of elliptic fibrations with extra sections can be characterized systematically\n[41, 37, 42]. We have not considered elliptic fibrations with multiple sections here, but\nthese would provide an important direction for systematically expanding on this work.\n4.2 Non-toric bases\nWhile we have focused in this paper on toric bases, a similar analysis can be carried out\nfor non-toric bases. Some of the results described above provide bounds on elliptically\nfibered Calabi-Yau threefolds independent of whether the base is toric, such as the upper\nbound h21 \u2264 491 and the identification of the possible Hodge number combinations for\nlarge h21 > 400. More work would be needed, however, beyond the analysis of Weierstrass\ntunings discussed in the previous section, to produce a complete list of Hodge pairs possible\nfor elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds including non-toric bases. The analysis of [9]\nplaces constraints on the kinds of clusters that can appear and their connection structure\neven on non-toric bases. This leads to bounds on the gauge groups allowed in F-theory\nmodels and constrains the set of allowed possibilities. A simple example of a class of nontoric bases that is explored in [10] corresponds to bases containing a number n of \u22124 curves\nand no other curves of self-intersection \u22123 or less. In the F-theory context these correspond\nto gravity theories with gauge group SO(8)n and no matter. Simple constraints on possible\nconfigurations bound n \u2264 20, and a stronger bound closer to n \u2264 12 is probably possible.\nSome models with T = 9 + n are given in [10], where the divisor structure on the base\ncontains a set of closed loops with alternating \u22121, \u22124 curves. The resolved Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds elliptically fibered over these bases will have h11 = 11 + 5n, h21 = 11 \u2212 n. These\nHodge numbers appear in the Kreuzer and Skarke list for n = 3, . . . , 9. In general, many\nmore non-toric bases than toric bases support elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds,\nand a systematic analysis of the possibilities, particularly for bases carrying large nonHiggsable gauge groups in the F-theory picture, might expand the story presented here in\ninteresting directions. In general, however, it seems likely that including non-toric bases\nwill not produce Calabi-Yau threefolds with Hodge numbers that go significantly outside\nthe region spanned by the threefolds elliptically fibered over toric bases. In particular, it\nseems unlikely that non-toric bases can give elliptically fibered threefolds with significantly\nlarger Hodge numbers than those found here. The reason that it may be difficult to realize\nlarge Hodge numbers follows similar lines to the heuristic arguments in [10] arguing that\nit is difficult to find a base associated with a T value much larger than T = 193. The basic\nidea is that the only way to get large T (or large h11 ) is to incorporate many e8 summands\nin the gauge algebra. But this requires divisors of self-intersection \u221212 in the base, and\nsuch divisors can only be connected to clusters of the form \u22122, \u22122, \u22123. The optimal known\nbase (the T = 193 model in Table 2) involves a linear such chain - basically 16 copies of\nthe periodic sequence (3.1). Adding loops or extra branching to the network of intersecting\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\firreducible effective curves does not seem to provide structure that could increase T or h11\nsignificantly beyond the T = 193 case. Furthermore, bases at large T , like Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds with large h11 + h21 , become sparse, at least in the toric constructions known, so\nit is harder to find structures that would push the bounds very far. Thus, it seems likely\nthat while systematically including non-toric bases will dramatically increase the range of\npossible Calabi-Yau threefold constructions, this will not significantly modify the bounds\nof the region of allowed Hodge numbers.\nNote that both for the additional models found by tuning Weierstrass parameters on\ntoric bases discussed in the previous section, and for threefolds fibered over non-toric bases,\nall these elliptically fibered threefolds will be connected through blowing up and blowing\ndown points in the bases. Thus, this very large set of threefolds are connected in a network.\n4.3 Non-elliptically fibered threefolds\nThe fact that the number of birational equivalence classes of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds is finite was proven some time ago [43]. A simple argument for this conclusion from the minimal model/Weierstrass picture is given in [32]. So it is not surprising\nthat there are bounds to the Hodge numbers possible for elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds. While it will be interesting to further analyze the precise bounds on the elliptically fibered class of spaces, the most interesting questions involve the more general set\nof Calabi-Yau threefolds without the restriction to elliptic fibrations. The fact that the\nboundary of the region of allowed Hodge numbers seems to be the same for the sampling of\ntoric hypersurface models considered by Kreuzer and Skarke and for the more constrained\nset of elliptic fibrations over toric bases suggests that the bounds on Hodge numbers may\nbe universal and apply to non-elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds in general.\nWhile the approach taken here does not suggest any completely general approach\nto bounding the Hodge numbers for arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefolds, it does suggest one\napproach which may lead to bounds at least for the set of threefolds connected by extremal\ntransitions. The transitions we have described here are associated with blowing up and\ndown points on the base of an elliptic fibration. These correspond in the threefolds to\ntransitions that connect manifolds of different topology in more complicated ways [12],\nsuch as the conifold transition. It may be enlightening to consider the combinatorial\nstructure of how the triple intersection product and Mori cone of threefolds connected by\nblow-up transitions in the base are related. This may suggest a more general set of rules\nfor transitions that would allow for a generalization of the bounds considered here to more\ngeneral Calabi-Yau threefolds. A related approach has recently been used to construct\nnovel Calabi-Yau threefolds with small Hodge numbers using conifold-type transitions [7].\n4.4 Elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds\nA similar exploration of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds through toric 3D base\nmanifolds may reveal structure analogous to the \"shield\" pattern for Hodge numbers of\nCY fourfolds. While the set of transitions between threefold bases is more complicated,\nin the toric context the mathematics of Mori theory is well understood and it should be\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fpossible to systematically explore the space of toric threefold bases, as outlined briefly in\n[10]. Work in this direction is currently underway.\nAcknowledgements: Particular thanks to Dave Morrison, with whom much of the\nwork leading up to this paper was carried out, for many helpful discussions.
