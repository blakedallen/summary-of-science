Introduction\nCram\u00e9r's tilt transform of a random variable (r.v.) X is a r.v. Xc such that\nEf (Xc ) =\n\nEf (X)ec X\nEec X\n\n(1.1)\n\nfor all nonnegative Borel functions f , where c is a real parameter. This transform\nis an important tool in the theory of large deviation probabilities P(X > x),\nwhere x > 0 is a large number; then the appropriate value of the parameter c\nis positive. As e.g. in the proof of [16, Theorem 2.3], one often needs to bound\nfrom above the f -moment Ef (Xc ) of the c-tilted r.v. Xc for a nonnegative f \u2013\nand therefore one needs to bound the denominator Eec X in (1.1) from below. If\nEX = 0, this can be done quite easily: by Jensen's inequality, Eec X > 1.\nA usual problem with this approach occurs when the right tail of X is too\nheavy for EecX to be finite and hence for the transform to make sense. The\nstandard cure in such situations is to truncate the r.v. X, say to Ty (X) :=\nX I {X 6 y} for some real number y > 0, where I {*} is the indicator function.\nThen, of course, Eec Ty (X) < \u221e for any c > 0. However, now instead of the\ncondition EX = 0 one has ETy (X) 6 0, and the inequality Eec Ty (X) > 1 (in\n1\nimsart ver.\n\n2005/05/19 file:\n\narxiv.tex date:\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n\fIosif Pinelis/Bounds on the exponential moments\n\n2\n\nplace of Eec X > 1) will not hold in general. In fact, Eec Ty (X) can be however\nsmall for some c > 0, even if one imposes a restriction such as EX 2 6 \u03c3 2 for a\ngiven real \u03c3 > 0 \u2013 see the discussion in Subsection 2.3.\nA much better way to cut off the right tail of the distribution of X is the socalled Winsorization. That is, instead of the truncation Ty (X), one deals with\nWy (X) := y \u2227 X = min(y, X). Clearly, Wy (X) > Ty (X) and hence Eec Wy (X) >\nEec Ty (X) for c > 0. Moreover, it turns out that for any given real \u03c3 > 0 and\ny > 0 the infimum of Eec Wy (X) over all c > 0 and all r.v.'s X with EX > 0 and\nEX 2 6 \u03c3 2 is strictly positive; furthermore, it decreases slowly from 1 to 0 as \u03c3\nincreases from 0 to \u221e. These properties of Winsorization make it a clear winner\nover truncation in many relevant situations.\n2. Results\nTake any real \u03c3 > 0. Let X denote any r.v. with\nEX > 0\n\nand EX 2 6 \u03c3 2 .\n\nFor any positive real a and b, let Xa,b stand for any zero-mean r.v. with\nvalues in the two-point set {\u2212a, b}; thus, the distribution of Xa,b is uniquely\n2\ndetermined by a and b.

However, by simple rescaling\nit is easy to restate the results for any positive \"cut\" level y. Indeed, one may\nconsider Wy (x) := y \u2227 x and Ty (x) := x I {x < y}, so that W1 = W and T1 = T .\nThen c Wy (X) = c y W (X/y) and c Ty (X) = c y T (X/y). Now one can use the\nresults of Subsections 2.1 and 2.2 with c, X, and \u03c3 replaced by c y, X/y, and\n\u03c3/y, respectively. It should therefore be clear that the \"cut\" level was set to be\n1 just for the simplicity of presentation.\nObserve that for each c > 0 the exact lower bound LW ;c,\u03c3 in (2.9) is no\ngreater than 1, since the zero r.v. X obviously satisfies the conditions EX > 0\nand EX 2 6 \u03c3 2 . Hence, the exact lower bounds LW ;\u03c3 and LT ;c,\u03c3 , which are no\ngreater than LW ;c,\u03c3 , are as well no greater than 1. It is also clear that each of\nthese exact lower bounds is nondecreasing in \u03c3 \u2013 since the exactness is over all\nr.v.'s X with EX > 0 and EX 2 6 \u03c3 2 .\nHowever, for any c > 0 the exact lower bound LW ;c,\u03c3 for the WinLW ;\u03a3\nsorized r.v. W (X) decreases rather\n1.0\nslowly from 1 to 0 as \u03c3 increases\n0.8\nfrom 0 to \u221e. Even the smaller, universal over all c > 0 exact lower\n0.6\nbound LW ;\u03c3 decreases rather slowly;\n0.4\nsee Figure 1 and also recall Proposition 2.3. In particular, for the value\n0.2\n\u03c3 2 = 1 (which is of special interest\n\u03a3 as far as the application in [16] is\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nconcerned) the lower bound LW ;\u03c3 is\n0.878 . . . , rather close to 1. Even for\nFig 1. The exact lower bound LW ;\u03c3 .\n\u03c3 2 = 100, this bound is 0.194 . . . , not\nvery small.\nMoreover, the universal (over all c > 0) Winsorization bound LW ;\u03c3 is remarkably close to the fixed-c Winsorization bounds LW ;c,\u03c3 , especially if the value of\nc is in the interval [1, 3] = { p2 : 2 6 p 6 6} \u2013 which is of particular interest in\n[16]. See the picture at the top of Figure 2; the green graph there, for c = 2 \u2013\ncf.

The bottom\npicture of Figure 2 shows the graphs\n0.4\nof the ratios of these two bounds for\n0.2\nc = 1, 32 , 2, 3, 5.\nIt is also easy to compare the asymp\u03a3\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\ntotics for LT ;c,\u03c3 in (2.25) and (2.26)\nwith that for LW ;c,\u03c3 in (2.12) and\nLT;c,\u03a3 \u0090LW ;c,\u03a3\n(2.13).\nComparing (2.12) with (2.25),\n1.0\nit is easy to see that for \u03c3 \u2193 0 one has\n0.8\n1 \u2212 LT ;c,\u03c3 is at least 4 times as large\n(asymptotically)\nas 1\u2212LW ;c,\u03c3 , and may\n0.6\nbe infinitely many times as large when\n0.4\nc goes to 0 or \u221e.

Indeed, let a \u2193 0, b := \u03c3 2 /a, and c := 1/a2 ; then it is easy to\nsee that E exp{c T (Xa,b )} \u2192 0; cf. (2.25) and (2.26), with large c.\nThe general\nproblem of finding the maximum or minimum of the generalized\nR\nmoment Rf d\u03bc over the set of all nonnegative measures with given generalized\nmoments fi d\u03bc (i \u2208 I) goes back to Chebyshev and Markov; here a function\nf and a family of functions (fi )i\u2208I are given; see, e.g., [6, 8\u201311, 13]. One group\nof results in this area is that for finite I under general conditions it may be\nassumed without loss of generality that the support of \u03bc is also finite, with\ncardinality no greater than that of I; methods based on such results may be\nreferred to as finite-support methods. Other results, valid for finite or infinite I,\nconcern\nthe following duality:\nR\nR under general conditions, the supremum (say) of\nfRd\u03bc over all \u03bc such that fi d\u03bc 6 ci for all i \u2208 I coincides with the infimum\nof I ci \u03bd(di)\nR over all nonnegative measures \u03bd on I (say with a finite support)\nsuch that I fi \u03bd(di) > f .\nSuch methods\nwere usedR e.g. in [1\u20133, 7,R 12, 17\u201319].

This result was extended in [2, 3] to the Eaton-like moment\nfunctions (* \u2212 t)2+ (t \u2208 R) in place of the exponential function e* in [7]; on the\nother hand, this was a further development of the line of results obtained in [4, 5,\n13, 14]. The results of [1, 7] and [2, 3] were refined in [17] and [12], respectively,\nby also taking\ninto account positive-part third moments. The supremum of the\nR\nmoments f d\u03bc over all Stein-type moment functions x 7\u2192 f (x) := xg(x)\u2212g \u2032 (x)\nwith Lipschitz-1 functions g \u2032 and over all probability measures \u03bc with given\nmean, variance, and third absolute moment was presented (in an equivalent\nform) in [18, Theorem 3]. Results somewhat related to the mentioned ones were\nobtained in [15]; see also the bibliography therein. Of course, mentioned above\nare a very small sample of the work done on the Chebyshev-Markov type of\nextremal problems.\nConcerning our problems of minimizing the exponential moments of W (X)\nand T (X), one could use mentioned finite-support methods to reduce the consideration to r.v.'s X taking only three values, since we have here three affine\nrestrictions: on the first two moments and on the total mass of the measure\n(which has to be a probability measure). Another, more ad hoc kind of approach would be to condition the distribution of the r.v. X on I {X < 1}, which\nwould preserve the mean and would not increase the second moment; also, this\nconditioning would not increase the exponential moments of W (X) and T (X),\nsince both functions, ecW and ecT , are convex on (\u2212\u221e, 1) and on [1, \u221e); thus, it\nwould remain to consider r.v.'s X taking only two values. However, the dualitytype method that we chose to prove (in the next section) inequalities (2.9) and\n(2.24) appears more effective, as it immediately reduces the consideration to\nr.v.'s Xa,b that, not only take just two values, but also have the first two moments exactly equal to 0 and \u03c3 2 , respectively; moreover, this approach appears\nmore convenient in obtaining the strictness conditions for inequalities (2.9) and\n(2.24).\n3. Proofs\nProof of Proposition 2.1.\n(I). Part (I) follows because ab\u2217a,c strictly and continuously increases from\n0 to \u221e as a increases from 0 to \u221e.\n(II). Observe that a(a2 + \u03c3 2 )2 l\u20321 (a) is a quadratic polynomial in \u03c3 2 , whence\none can see that the \u221a\nsystem of inequalities l\u20321 (a) > 0 and 0 < a < \u03c3 2 can be\nrewritten as 0 < a < 1 + \u03c3 2 \u2212 1. This means that l1 (a) switches from increase\nto decrease over a \u2208 (0, \u03c3 2 ); at that, l1 (0+) = \u2212\u221e and l1 (\u03c3 2 ) = 0.

Then it is straightforward to check that F (b) = G(b),\nF \u2032 (b) = G\u2032 (b), and F \u2032 (\u2212a) = G\u2032 (\u2212a). Let now b = b\u2217a,c . Then b > 2 > 1 and\nF (\u2212a) = G(\u2212a), so that\nF (b) = G(b),\n\nF \u2032 (b) = G\u2032 (b),\n\nF (\u2212a) = G(\u2212a),\n\nF \u2032 (\u2212a) = G\u2032 (\u2212a). (3.3)\n\nAlso, by (3.2), \u03b3 < 0 and hence the function G is strictly concave, while the\nfunction F is convex on (\u2212\u221e, 1) and on [1, \u221e); so, the difference D := F \u2212 G is\nstrictly convex on (\u2212\u221e, 1) and on [1, \u221e); at that, D(\u2212a) = D\u2032 (\u2212a) = D(b) =\nD\u2032 (b) = 0, whence D > 0 and F > G on R \\ {\u2212a, b}, while F = G on the twopoint set {\u2212a, b}. Now specify a, to a = ac,\u03c3 . Then, recalling (2.6) and (2.3),\none sees that\nb\u2217ac,\u03c3 ,c = bc,\u03c3 .\n(3.4)\nTherefore, also specifying b to b = bc,\u03c3 , one has\n\b\nEec W (X) = EF (X) > EG(X) > EG(Xa,b ) = EF (Xa,b ) = E exp c W (Xa,b ) ;\n(3.5)\n\u0001\nthe second inequality here takes place because in view of (3.2) \u03b2 > 0 > \u03b3,\nwhile EX > 0 = EXa,b and EX 2 6 \u03c3 2 = ab = EXa,b . Thus, (2.9) follows.\nMoreover, because F > G on R \\ {\u2212a, b}, the first inequality in (3.5) is strict\nunless the support of the distribution of X is a subset of {\u2212a, b}, and the second\ninequality in (3.5) is strict unless EX = 0 and EX 2 = \u03c3 2 = ab; thus indeed,\nD\ninequality (2.9) is strict unless X = Xa,b .\n\b\nTo prove inequality (2.10),\nit suffices to show that E exp c\u03c3 W (Xa\u03c3 ,b\u03c3 ) is\n\b\na lower bound on E exp c W (Xa,b ) for any a and b such that \ba \u2208 (0, \u03c3 2 ) and\nb = \u03c3 2 /a. Take indeed any such a and b. Observe that E exp c W (Xa,b ) =\na2 ec +e\u2212ac \u03c32\nis strictly convex in c \u2208 R and attains its minimum,\na2 +\u03c32\n\u0001\u2212 1\na(1 + a) \u03c3a2 1+a\nm(a, \u03c3) :=\n,\na2 + \u03c3 2\nin c only at c =\nequivalently, of\n\nln(\u03c32 /a)\n1+a\n\n=\n\nln b\n1+a\n\n\u2013 cf.

Next, the minimum of m(a, \u03c3) or,\n\nl(a) := l(a, \u03c3) := ln m(a, \u03c3)\nin a \u2208 (0, \u03c3 2 ) is attained only at the point a = a\u03c3 defined by (2.5), because, by\npart (II) of Proposition 2.1, l\u2032 (a) = l1 (a)/(1 + a)2 switches in sign from \u2212 to\n+ over a \u2208 (0, \u03c3 2 ). Thus, inequality (2.10) is true, and it is strict unless c = c\u03c3\nand ac,\u03c3 = a\u03c3 .\nIt remains to verify the three equalities in (2.11). In view of (3.4), the last of\nthese equalities is implied by the first one. So, if any of the equalities in (2.11)\nD\nwere false, then the equality Xa\u03c3 ,b\u03c3 = Xac\u03c3 ,\u03c3 ,bc\u03c3 ,\u03c3 would also be false, and so,\nby what has been proved, inequality (2.9) with c\u03c3 and Xa\u03c3 ,b\u03c3 in place of c and\nX would be strict, which would contradict inequality (2.10).\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.\nimsart ver.\n\n2005/05/19 file:\n\narxiv.tex date:\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n\fIosif Pinelis/Bounds on the exponential moments\n\n9\n\nProof of Proposition 2.3.\n(I) To prove part (I), consider first the case \u03c3 \u2193 0.

Now part (II) of Proposition 2.3\nfollows.\n(III) To prove part (III), consider first the case \u03c3 \u2193 0. Then, by (2.4) and\n(2.14), for each fixed t \u2208 (0, 1) one has l1 (t\u03c3 2 ) = ln t \u2212 (2 + o(1))(t \u2212 1) =\nf (t) + o(1). So, by part (II) of Proposition 2.3 for each fixed t \u2208 (0, t\u2217 ) one\nhas l1 (t\u03c3 2 ) < 0 \u2013 eventually, for all small enough \u03c3; similarly, for each fixed\nt \u2208 (t\u2217 , 1) eventually l1 (t\u03c3 2 ) > 0. Therefore, by (2.5), a\u03c3 \u223c t\u2217 \u03c3 2 and hence, by\n(2.7) and (2.8), b\u03c3 \u2192 1/t\u2217 and c\u03c3 \u2192 \u2212 ln t\u2217 .

Let\nnow a = \u03c3 2 , so that (by the current case condition) 0 < a 6 Ac , which implies\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\nBa,c\n6 1 and hence G\u2032 (1) 6 0 because G\u2032 (1) = (Ba,c\n\u2212 1)c e\u2212ac /(1 + a) ;\nalso, 0 < a 6 Ac implies (eac \u2212 1) \u2212 (1 + a)c < 2(eac \u2212 1) \u2212 (1 + a)c =\n\u2217\n(Ba,c\n\u2212 1)c 6 0, whence \u03b3 < 0, so that G is strictly convex on R; moreover,\n\u03b2 > e\u2212ac c (1 + a2 )/(1 + a)2 > 0. In turn, the inequality G\u2032 (1) 6 0 means that\nD\u2032 (1+) > 0; also, D is strictly convex on (\u2212\u221e, 1) and [1, \u221e); recalling now that\nD(\u2212a) = D\u2032 (\u2212a) = D(1) = 0, one has D > 0 and F > G on R \\ {\u2212a, 1}, while\nF = G on the two-point set {\u2212a, 1} = {\u2212\u03c3 2 , 1}. Now the first line of (2.24)\nfollows \u2013 cf. (3.5).\nConsider now the case \u03c3 2 > Ac . Here, take G(x) with\n\u03b1 :=\n\ne\u2212ac (ca2 + 2abc + 2a + 2b)\n,\n2(a + b)\n\n\u03b2 :=\n\ncbe\u2212ac\n,\na+b\n\n\u03b3 := \u2212\n\nce\u2212ac\n,\n2(a + b)\n\n\u2217\nwhere a > 0 and b := Ba,c\n. Assume now also that a is so large as b > 1. Then,\nagain for D := F \u2212 G, one has D(\u2212a) = D\u2032 (\u2212a) = D(b) = D\u2032 (b) = 0, while\n\u03b2 > 0 > \u03b3, so that again D is strictly convex on (\u2212\u221e, 1) and [1, \u221e), D > 0 and\nF > G on R \\ {\u2212a, b}, while F = G on the two-point set {\u2212a, b}; if b = 1 then\nD\u2032 (b) is understood as the right derivative of D at point 1. Since the current\n\u2217\ncase if \u03c3 2 > Ac , (2.23) yields Ac,\u03c3 > Ac and hence Bc,\u03c3 = \u03c3 2 /Ac,\u03c3 = BA\n>\nc,\u03c3 ,c\n\u2217\nBAc ,c = 1. Now, reasoning again similarly to (3.5), one obtains the second line\nof (2.24).\nThe proof of the strictness statement on (2.24) is quite similar to that for\n(2.9), because here as well one has \u03b2 > 0 > \u03b3 \u2013 in either case, whether \u03c3 2 6 Ac\nor \u03c3 2 > Ac .\n\nProof of Proposition 2.6.\n\nimsart ver.\n\n2005/05/19 file:\n\narxiv.tex date:\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n\fIosif Pinelis/Bounds on the exponential moments\n\n11\n\nHere the case \u03c3 \u2193 0 is quite staightforward. Indeed, then, by (2.24), one\n\u0001\n\u2212c \u03c32\neventually has LT ;c,\u03c3 \u2212 1 = E exp{c T X\u03c32 ,1 } \u2212 1 = e 1+\u03c32\u22121 \u223c \u2212c \u03c3 2 .\nAs for the case \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e, the proof of (2.26) is quite similar to that of relation\n(2.13) in part (I) of Proposition 2.3: replace all instances of b\u2217a,c , ac,\u03c3 , bc,\u03c3 , W\n\u2217\nby Ba,c\n, Ac,\u03c3 , Bc,\u03c3 , T , respectively, and also drop all instances of the factor ec\nin the numerators of the ratios in (3.7), (3.8), and (3.9).\n\nReferences\n[1] Bennett, G.
