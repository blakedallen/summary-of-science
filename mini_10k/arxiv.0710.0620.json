In particular, we study minima to the flux potential in type IIB compactifications on the mirror quintic. Using geometric transitions, we embed its onedimensional complex structure moduli space in that of another Calabi\u2013Yau with\nh1,1 = 86 and h2,1 = 2. We then show how to construct infinite series of continuously connected minima to the mirror quintic potential by moving into this larger\nmoduli space, applying its monodromies, and moving back. We provide an example\nof such series, and discuss their implications for the string theory landscape.\n\nOctober 2007\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nCompactifications of string theory on six-dimensional internal manifolds provide fourdimensional low-energy effective field theories that could describe our world. (See\ne.g. [1].) Since these models originate from string theory, there is a consistent way\nof completing them into theories of quantum gravity. However, there is an enormous number of such compactifications. Even if we restrict the internal manifold\nto be a (conformally) Calabi\u2013Yau threefold the number of possibilities is huge. Furthermore, compactifying string theory on a specific Calabi\u2013Yau leads to a family of\nfour-dimensional theories, since the moduli of the manifold are unfixed.1 Thus the\nsize and shape of the manifold can fluctuate both over three-dimensional space and\ntime. The latter can lead to dynamical problems, such as a rapid decompactification\nof the theory.\nOne way to fix the moduli of the manifold is to introduce fluxes, that pierce certain\nnon-trivial cycles of the manifold.2 In type IIB these fluxes will create a potential for\nthe complex structure moduli of the Calabi\u2013Yau [3]. In order to fix the K\u00e4hler moduli\nwe need to take quantum corrections of the theory into account [4, 5]. These effects\ntrap the moduli in metastable minima of the resulting potential, thus stabilizing the\ncompactification. The result is a metastable four-dimensional effective field theory,\nalso known as a string theory vacuum. Each vacuum corresponds to a particular\nchoice of internal manifold, moduli and fluxes. The large number of such vacua form\nthe string theory landscape [6].3\nA landscape of string theory vacua has many implications for the four-dimensional\nphysics of our world. Some consequences are universal, such as the non-uniqueness\nand metastability of universes. Other consequences for four-dimensional physics depend on the topography of the landscape, i.e. the distribution of vacua in parameter\nspace, the height and width of potential barriers between vacua, whether the landscape is smooth or rough etc. This will determine the probability for tunneling\nbetween vacua, and thus the life-time and evolution of a universe that is described by\none vacuum in the landscape. The topographic properties of the landscape are also\nimportant for the selection of a particular vacuum, and the computability problems\nrelated to this [7, 8, 9].\nMapping out the entire string theory landscape is an enormously difficult task.\nThe landscape is parametrized by a large number of continuous fields and discrete\nfluxes, and it is difficult to find a systematic way to describe the potential between\nvacua. However, we can ask ourselves if we can construct models for (parts of) the\nlandscape, and what we can learn from such models. Examples of such considerations\n1\n\nOften, when we speak of \"a Calabi-Yau threefold\", what we really mean is a family of CalabiYau threefolds. These threefolds are topologically equivalent, but their shapes and sizes differ, as\nspecified by their complex structure and K\u00e4hler moduli.\n2\nSee [2] for a nice review on flux compactifications.\n3\nCompactifications of other string theories also yield vacua in the landscape. To be precise, we\nshould note that introducing branes in the compactifications also yields new vacua.\n\n1\n\n\finclude [10, 11, 12, 13]. In particular, in [14], it was found that the potential created\nby three-fluxes in type IIB compactifications often has series of minima that are\nconnected by continuous paths in complex structure moduli space. The construction\nof such series was based on the use of monodromy transformations.\nMore specifically, by moving around singular points in the complex structure moduli space, monodromies transform the three-cycles pierced by fluxes. This is equivalent\nto changing the flux and keeping the cycles fixed. Thus it is possible to move continuously between different minima of the potential, corresponding to different discrete\nflux values, and still have full control over the potential. Some explicit examples of\nsuch series were computed numerically for the mirror quintic, yielding a complete\npicture of the barriers between minima in this model landscape.\nHowever, we cannot resolve the barriers between all minima. Not all flux configurations - and hence not all minima of the potential - are connected by monodromy\ntransformations. This suggests a subdivision of the landscape into several islands.\nOnly minima on the same island are connected by continuous paths in complex structure moduli space.\nIn the analysis of [14] some questions remained open. The first concerned the\nlength of the series. Although only finite series of continuously connected minima\nwere found, there was no general argument as to why infinite series should not exist.4\nOne way of indirectly proving the existence of infinite connected series, relates to an\ninteresting mathematical question. The monodromy transformations of the mirror\nquintic form a subgroup of Sp(4, Z) so only islands connected by such transformations can possibly be connected by monodromies. Furthermore, there are infinite\nseries connected by Sp(4, Z) transformations [14]. This means that if the index of\nthe monodromy group is finite in Sp(4, Z) - meaning that the number of islands\nconnected by symplectic transformations are finite - then there are infinite series\nconnected by monodromy transformations. Unfortunately, it is not known whether\nthis index is finite or not [15].\nAnother question was whether these islands in the landscape really exist, or if\nthey are only an artifact of modeling too small a part of the landscape. In this paper\nwe introduce a new way of computing potential barriers between string theory vacua.\nWe follow new paths that take us to other parts of the landscape. These paths go via\ntopology changing transitions of the internal manifold.\nIt is well known that many Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are connected through geometric\ntransitions [16, 17]. E.g., as we will discuss below, it is reasonable to assume that the\nmirror quintic, M(101,1) , is connected to a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold with two complex\n4\n\nNote that we are only studying minima of the potential created by fluxes. When we discuss the\nlength of the series of minima we disregard the fixing of K\u00e4hler moduli, which, in e.g. the KKLT\nmodel [4], depends on the magnitude of the fluxes. For the sake of argument, we will also disregard\nquestions about back-reaction of the fluxes on the manifold (see e.g. [2] and references therein).\nEven though these effects would probably cut off the series of vacua in the string theory landscape\nat finite length, we expect the remaining series to be long. Hence there are interesting topographic\nfeatures, such as many closely spaced vacua, in the string theory landscape if these infinite series of\nminima exist.\n\n2\n\n\fCo\nm\npl\n\nex\n\nKahler\n\nM (101,1)\n\nCo\nm\npl\nex\n\nM (86,2)\nComplex\n\nFigure 1: The two moduli spaces near the geometric transition. The intersection of the\ntwo planes represents the moduli space of the singular manifold, which has 86 remaining\nK\u00e4hler moduli and 1 remaining complex structure modulus. Blowing up two-cycles turns\nthe singular manifold into a nonsingular mirror quintic, moving it in its K\u00e4hler moduli\nspace. Blowing up three-cycles turns the singular manifold into a nonsingular M(86,2) ,\nmoving it in its complex structure moduli space. Note that in particular, we can think of\nthe complex structure moduli space M(101,1) of the mirror quintic as a submanifold of the\ncomplex structure moduli space M(86,2) of M(86,2) .\nstructure moduli and 86 K\u00e4hler moduli, M(86,2) , through a so-called conifold, or\ngeometric, transition. Thus, we can view the complex structure moduli space of\nthe mirror quintic as a subspace of the moduli space of the other Calabi\u2013Yau. It is\npossible to make excursions into this larger space and use its monodromies to find\ncontinuous paths between minima on the mirror quintic.\nTo reach the singular point where the conifold transition can happen we need to\nmove in the K\u00e4hler moduli space of the mirror quintic, as shown in figure 1. It follows\nthat the paths between the minima will go through both the K\u00e4hler moduli space of\nthe mirror quintic and the complex structure moduli space of M(86,2) . In this way, we\nget new continuous paths between minima in our model landscape. If we have a good\ndescription of the potential on both the K\u00e4hler and the complex structure moduli\nspaces, we get a complete description of the potential barriers between minima.\nThis paper will probe deeper into the topography of this model landscape, by\nextending the complex structure moduli space of the mirror quintic using conifold\ntransitions as described above. To do this, we first compute the geometric data of\nthe Calabi\u2013Yau M(86,2) using toric geometry (section 2). In section 3 we compute\n3\n\n\fthe periods and monodromies of M(86,2) and in section 4 we show how the complex structure moduli space of M(101,1) is embedded in the moduli space of M(86,2) .\nThe geometric transition between M(86,2) and M(101,1) , with and without fluxes, is\ndiscussed in section 5. In section 6, we give an explicit example of a continuously\nconnected series of minima and provide an example of an infinite series. Conventions\nand a recapitulation of Calabi\u2013Yau geometry are given in appendix A.\nLet us briefly comment on the validity of the techniques used in this paper. The\nperiod and monodromy calculations we use are usually applied in the setting of N = 2\ncompactifications, without fluxes. Here, however, we are interested in the case when\nflux is turned on. Evading no-go theorems [18, 19, 20] then requires the inclusion\nof orientifold planes, which reduces the supersymmetry to N = 1. Fortunately, this\nhas little effect for practical calculations: the geometric moduli are kept after the\norientifold projection (though they are now part of N = 1 multiplets), and in the\nlarge volume limit the terms in the effective N = 1 action correspond directly to\nthe N = 2 terms that are calculated here. Of course, when one leaves this regime\nthere might be \u03b1\u2032 -corrections to the potential (coming from cross-cap instantons, for\nexample), but for the purpose of doing monodromy transformations, one can always\nkeep the Calabi-Yau large.\n\nToric description of M(86,2)\n\n2\n\nIn this paper, we are interested in continuous deformations of the periods of the mirror\nquintic. In particular, we want to study how these periods depend on the coordinates\nof the complex structure moduli space.\nThe mirror quintic M(101,1) , with Hodge numbers h1,1 = 101 and h2,1 = 1, is\nrelated through mirror symmetry [21, 22] to the quintic in P4 , which has h1,1 = 1\nand h2,1 = 101. The quintic itself is furthermore known to be connected [17, 23] to a\nmanifold of Hodge numbers h1,1 = 2 and h2,1 = 86 through a geometric transition.5\nIt is therefore natural to expect that the mirror of this process also occurs6 and that\nthe mirror quintic has a geometric transition to a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold M(86,2) with\nHodge numbers\nh1,1 = 86,\nh2,1 = 2.\n(1)\n5\n\nWhen two families of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are related by a geometric transition their moduli\nspaces are connected through some loci where the manifolds are singular. The geometric transition\ncan be understood as the shrinking of some three-spheres and the successive blowing up of the\nresulting singularities into two-spheres. The simplest example of this behavior is the transition\nbetween resolved and deformed conifolds. See section 5 for a more complete discussion.\n6\nAs far as we are aware, there is no mathematical theorem claiming that the mirror of a geometric\ntransition is again a geometric transition. However, this has been suggested to be true in several\nexplicit cases, see e. g. [30]. In the present case, we will see explicitly how the complex structure\nmoduli space of the mirror quintic can be embedded in that of M(86,2) .\n\n4\n\n\fWe will see below that mirror symmetry indeed suggests a natural candidate for this\nmanifold.\nWe will exploit the above relations between moduli spaces to find very general\ncontinuous deformations of the periods of the mirror quintic. In particular we will\nbe interested in the behavior of the periods under the geometric transition between\nthe mirror quintic and the manifold M(86,2) . In order to construct the manifold and\ncalculate the periods and their behavior under these deformations, we will use the\ntools of toric geometry.\n\n2.1\n\nToric Geometry for Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds\n\nIt is possible to construct Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds as the common zero locus of a set\nof polynomials defined on a toric variety. In this subsection we will briefly review\nhow to obtain these equations and the embedding toric variety using polytopes of\nlattice points. The data encoded in these points are useful to define a suitable set\nof coordinates on the complex structure moduli space, and to compute the periods\nof the Calabi\u2013Yau threefold (see section 3). Moreover, the defining equations for\nthe mirror of a Calabi\u2013Yau can be represented through another polytope related to\nthe original one, following a method by V. Batyrev [24]. In this subsection we will\nstate the general procedure and define the basic concepts in order to understand it.\nReaders not well-versed in toric geometry might want to consult [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].\n\u2217 n\nA d-dimensional toric variety X can be constructed as a quotient X = (C )G \u2212Z ,\nwhere G is an m-dimensional group, and d = n \u2212 m. It contains the complex torus\n(C\u2217 )d as an open subset in such a way that the action of the torus on itself, given by\nthe group structure, extends to the whole of X.\nWe can either study the toric variety using a set of affine coordinates {ti , i =\n1 . . . d}, corresponding to coordinates on the torus (C\u2217 )d , or with a set of homogeneous\nones {xj , j = 1 . . . n} describing the entire manifold. Using either of these coordinate\nsets, we can construct a set of monomials that form the building blocks for the defining\nequations of the Calabi\u2013Yau. In this paper, we will mainly use the affine coordinates.\nLet us first discuss the case where the Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is defined through\na single equation. A convenient way to encode monomials is by points in a lattice.\nEvery monomial of the form\nd\nY\nm\ni\ntm\n(2)\ni \u2261 t\ni=1\n\nis represented by a vector of exponents m in some lattice M \u223c\n= Zd . More generally,\na polytope \u2206 \u2282 M describes a set of monomials. The vector space given by all the\nlinear combinations of such monomials is known as the space of Laurent polynomials\nassociated to the polytope \u2206. A Laurent polynomial belonging to this space therefore\nhas the form\nX\nL({ti }) =\nal tml , ml \u2208 \u2206.\n(3)\nl\n\n5\n\n\fThe set of homogeneous coordinates is defined as follows: given a polytope \u2206 \u2282 M,\nwe can define its dual, or polar, polytope as\n\u2206\u25e6 = {n \u2208 N|hm, ni \u2265 \u22121, \u2200m \u2208 \u2206}.\n\n(4)\n\nHere, N \u223c\n= Zd is the lattice dual to M. With a simplified notation we can write:\nh\u2206\u25e6 , \u2206i \u2265 \u22121.\n\n(5)\n\nTo every vertex nj of this polytope we can associate a homogeneous coordinate\nxj . The two sets of coordinates are then related by the equations\nti =\n\nd\nY\n\n<ei ,nj >\n\nxj\n\n(6)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere ei , are the basis vectors of M. Using this relation, starting from the Laurent\nmonomials we can define the set of monomials in the homogeneous coordinates xj\nthat are invariant under the group G appearing in the quotient construction of the\ntoric variety.\nAs a side remark, we note that the lattice N is often taken as the starting point for\nthe construction of a toric variety. The fan \u03a3 describing the toric variety is a collection\nof cones in Rd \u2283 N. The cones of \u03a3 are spanned by the faces of \u2206\u25e6 . In particular,\nthere a one-to-one relation among the one-dimensional cones, the vertices of \u2206\u25e6 and\nthe homogeneous coordinates. Thus, a polytope \u2206 contains all the information we\nneed7 to construct a toric variety, which we therefore denote by X\u2206 .\nWe have now collected all the ingredients: the zero locus of the Laurent polynomials (or their homogenization through (6)) of \u2206 defines a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold8 inside\nthe toric variety X\u2206 . If \u2206 is reflexive, meaning roughly that it contains the origin as\nits only interior point, the Laurent polynomials that we can instead obtain from the\ndual polytope \u2206\u25e6 define its mirror manifold. This result is the mirror construction of\nV. Batyrev [24].\nAbove, we have described a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold as a hypersurface defined by a\nsingle polynomial, but we can also study the complete9 intersection of several hypersurfaces. In this case, a refined construction is necessary [32, 33, 34, 35]. Once again,\nthe data of the manifold are encoded in a lattice polytope, but now this polytope is\nappropriately partitioned into a set of sub-polytopes10 :\nX\n\u2206k\n(7)\n\u2206=\nk\n\n7\n\nIn fact, to make the variety smooth, in certain cases one needs a triangulation or a refinement\nof \u2206\u25e6 with additional vertices. We will not go into these details here.\n8\nFor the conditions on when the manifold is indeed Calabi\u2013Yau, see e. g. [24].\n9\nThe completeness condition is a certain regularity condition; see [31] for details.\n10\nThe relevant sum here and in (8) is the Minkowski sum, and the partition must be a so-called\nnef partition [34, 35]. The term nef (\"numerically effective\") basically means that when shifted\nappropriately, the constituent polytopes intersect only in the origin.\n\n6\n\n\fEvery sub-polytope will encode the data of one of the defining Laurent polynomials\nfor the Calabi\u2013Yau. This time, its mirror manifold is obtained from a related polytope\nand a corresponding partition:\nX\n\u2207=\n\u2207k .\n(8)\nk\n\nThe sub-polytopes \u2207k are given by\n\n\u2207k = Conv({0} \u222a \u2203k ),\n\nh\u2207k , \u2206k\u2032 i \u2265 \u2212\u03b4k,k\u2032 .\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, the round brackets indicate the convex hull and the \u2203k are defined as a partition\nof the vertices of the dual polytope \u2206\u25e6 for \u2206 such that:\n[\n\u2206\u25e6 = Conv( \u2203k ).\n(10)\nk\n\nIn the next subsection, we will explicitly construct the nef partition {\u2206k } for the\nmanifold M(86,2) of our interest. It is evident from the description above that, \u2207 and\n\u2206 being mirror to each other, we can start the construction of the mirror pair from\nan assigned polytope \u2207. In this case we will partition its dual as:\n[\n\u2207\u25e6 = Conv( Ek ),\n(11)\nk\n\nwhere h\u2203k , Ek\u2032 i \u2265 \u2212\u03b4k,k\u2032 , and from this, just as above, we will obtain:\n\u2206k = Conv({0} \u222a Ek ),\n\n(12)\n\nwhich we are eventually interested in.\n\n2.2\n\nToric data for M(86,2)\n\nIn order to obtain and list the data for the manifold M(86,2) , it is convenient to start\nfrom those of its mirror, which we denote W(2,86) . Therefore, we obtain the polytope\n\u2206 and its nef partition {\u2206k } relevant for M(86,2) , starting form its mirror \u2207 and the\nnef partition for W(2,86) . A useful tool in performing the calculations below is the\npackage PALP [36].\nA well-known way [17, 37] to describe the manifold W(2,86) is as a complete intersection of two hypersurfaces given by equations of degree (1, 4) and (1, 1) in P1 \u00d7 P4 .\nThese equations can be described by the polytope and the nef partition11\n\u2207 = \u2207 1 + \u22072\n\n(13)\n\n11\nTo describe the equations,we could have taken any shifted version of these polytopes.

First we subdivide the set E of vertices of \u2207\u25e6 in two sets E = E1 \u222a E2 :\nE1 = {(1, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121)}\nE2 = {(\u22121, 0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)} .\n(14)\nsuch that hEk , \u2207k\u2032 i \u2265 \u2212\u03b4k,k\u2032 .

As a consistency check, one can then show that the mirror\nof the mirror is the original manifold. In this paper, we will have no need for the\nexplicit expressions of the further toric data involved, so we omit them here.\n12\n\nConvention: the vertices are written as the rows of the matrix.\nThis fan is simply the direct sum of the fans for P1 and P4 . It has seven one-dimensional cones:\ntwo for P1 and five for P4 .\n13\n\n8\n\n\f2.3\n\nLocal equations and Mori generators\n\nAs explained previously we can write the defining equation for the complete intersection in homogeneous or affine coordinates. In terms of the affine coordinates, we can\nconveniently relate each lattice point in the \u2206i to a monomial, and we simply read\noff the equations:\nf1 \u2261 1 \u2212 g1 = 1 \u2212 a1 t1 \u2212 a2 t3 \u2212 a3 t4 \u2212 a4 t5 \u2212 a5 /t2 t3 t4 t5\nf2 \u2261 1 \u2212 g2 = 1 \u2212 a6 /t1 \u2212 a7 t2 ,\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere we used the convention of scaling the constant term to 1 and giving all other\nterms a minus sign. The ai in these equations are adjustable constants. It turns out\nthat these local equations are enough to determine the periods of the holomorphic\nthree-form on M(86,2) . We do this calculation in section 3.\nVarying the ai changes the complex structure of our manifold. As can be expected\nfrom the fact that the moduli space has dimension two, not all of the ai are moduli:\nonly certain combinations of them are. In fact, we will see in the next section that it is\nthe constant terms in the products g1n g2m that determine the moduli. We can expand\nevery power of g1 and g2 , respectively, in Newton binomials, and therefore these\nconstant terms will be given by those powers ll of the monomials tml , ml \u2208 \u22061 \u222a \u22062 ,\nin g1 , g2 such that\nll ml = 0, l = 1, . . . |\u22061 \u222a \u22062 |.\n(17)\nwhere |\u22061 \u222a \u22062 | is the number of points in \u22061 \u222a \u22062 (excluding the origin).\nIt is easy to see that the vectors l of the coefficients {ll } of these relations form a\nvector space. A convenient choice of basis for this space is\n\u0012 (1) \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nl\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n=\n.\n(18)\n0 1 1 1 1 0 1\nl(2)\n\nThis basis corresponds to a set of coordinates\nY l(k)\n\u03c6k =\nall\n\n(19)\n\nl\n\nfor the complex structure moduli space, that are particularly useful for describing\nmirror constructions. In our case, in fact, each positive linear combination ml(1) +nl(2)\nn\ncorresponds to a power of \u03c6m\n1 \u03c62 appearing in some product of g1 's and g2 's, where\n\u03c61 = a1 a6 ,\n\n\u03c62 = a2 a3 a4 a5 a7 .\n\n(20)\n\nThus, the cone14 generated by l(1) and l(2) will play a crucial role in calculating the\nperiods of the holomorphic three-form. This cone is called the Mori cone, and the l(i)\nare called the Mori generators.\n14\n\nThat is, the linear combinations of l(1,2) with non-negative coefficients, corresponding to nonnegative powers of the monomials.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nPeriods and monodromies of M(86,2)\n\nIn this section we put the machinery of toric geometry to work. Our aim is to calculate the periods and monodromies of M(86,2) . The periods are obtained by finding\nthe solutions to a system of partial differential equations \u2013 the Picard\u2013Fuchs (PF)\nequations. Studying the asymptotic behavior of the periods yields two monodromy\ntransformations of M(86,2) .\nThe methods for computing the periods and monodromies are well-known, but\nto our knowledge the periods of this particular manifold have not been explicitly\ncomputed before. (See however [38].) A reader familiar with this type of computations\ncan skip the derivations and read the results in equations (44)-(46).\n\n3.1\n\nThe Picard\u2013Fuchs equations\n\nThe periods of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold are the \"holomorphic volumes \"of a basis of 3cycles CI (I = 1, .., 2(h2,1+1)):\nI\n\u03a0I =\n\u03a9(\u03c6i ),\n(21)\nCI\n\nwhere \u03a9(\u03c6i ) is the holomorphic 3-form on the manifold, which depends on the complex\nstructure moduli \u03c6i .\nThe periods must satisfy the Picard\u2013Fuchs (PF) equations, as we now explain.\nRepeated differentiation of \u03a9(\u03c6i ) gives elements in H 3 = H 3,0 \u2295 H 2,1 \u2295 H 1,2 \u2295 H 0,3 .\nSince H 3 has finite dimension, some combinations of derivatives of \u03a9(\u03c6i ) must be\nexact. Thus Lk \u03a9(\u03c6i ) = d\u03b7, where Lk are some differential operators. Integrating over\na 3-cycle we find that the periods must fulfill\nI\nI\nLk \u03a0I =\nLk \u03a9(\u03c6i ) =\nd\u03b7 = 0.\n(22)\nCI\n\nCI\n\nThese are the Picard\u2013Fuchs (PF) equations. By solving them, we find the periods.\nTo derive the PF equations we use a method based on toric geometry, described\nin [39]. We build a set of differential operators \u2013 the generalized hypergeometric\nGel'fand\u2013Kapranov\u2013Zelevinski (GKZ) system\u2013 from which, by suitable factorization\n[39, 40], we can extract the PF operators. These will be written in terms of the\ncoordinates \u03c61 , \u03c62 in equation (20), that were defined starting from the coefficients of\nthe Laurent polynomials (15,16) and the generators of the Mori cone (18).\nThe differential operators of the GKZ system are also defined from the generators\nl(k) of the Mori cone [40]:\nLk =\n\u2212\n\nr\nY\n\n(l\u03b1(k) \u03b8k )(l\u03b1(k) \u03b8k \u2212 1)...(l\u03b1(k) \u03b8k \u2212 l\u03b1(k) + 1)\n\n\u03b1=1\ns\nY\n\n\u03b2=1\n\n\u2212\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(i)\nl0\u03b2 \u03b8i\n\n!\n\n... \u2212\n10\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\n(i)\nl0\u03b2 \u03b8i\n\n\u2212\n\n(k)\nl0\u03b2\n\n!\n\n+ 1 \u03c6k ,\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8k = \u03c6k \u2202\u03c6\u2202 k , r and s are the dimension and the number of the l(k) respectively,\nP (i)\n(i)\nand l0\u03b2 = \u2212 \u03b1 l\u03b1 |E\u03b2 .15 In our example we obtain:\nL1 = \u03b812 \u2212 (\u03b81 + \u03b82 )(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 )\u03c61\nL2 = \u03b825 \u2212 (\u03b81 + \u03b82 )(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 )(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 1)(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 2)(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 3)\u03c62 .\n\n(24)\n\nThe periods of M(86,2) are solutions to the equations Lk \u03c9 = 0, but in general there are\nother solutions as well [39]. In fact, the monodromy group does not act irreducibly\non the solutions of the GKZ system, as it should do on the periods [40]. To get rid\nof the false solutions, we factorize [39, 40] the differential operators as\nL1 = L1\np1 L2 = L2 \u2212 p3 L1 ,\n\n(25)\n\nL1 = \u03b812 \u2212 p1 \u03c61\nL2 = \u22124\u03b823 + 5\u03b81 \u03b822 + (a\u03b81 + b\u03b82 )\u03b812 + p2 \u03c61 + p3 \u03c62\n\n(26)\n\np1 = (\u03b81 + \u03b82 )(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 )\np2 = \u2212a\u03b813 \u2212 (b + 5a)\u03b812 \u03b82 \u2212 (5b + 4a + 5)\u03b81 \u03b822 \u2212 (4b + 21)\u03b823\np3 = 16(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 1)(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 2)(\u03b81 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 3).\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n\nare the PF operators16 and\n\nNote that Lk \u03a0 = 0 =\u21d2 Lk \u03a0 = 0, but not vice versa. There are six linearly\nindependent solutions to the PF equations, corresponding to the six periods of the\nM(86,2) . To compute the periods we need the classical intersection numbers \u03baijk of\nM(86,2) . These can be read off from the PF operators as was explained in [40]. The\nprocedure can be summarized as follows. The numbers are defined as\nZ\n\u03baijk = Ji \u2227 Jj \u2227 Jk .\n(28)\nThe Jk 's are (1,1)-forms on M(86,2) that constitute a basis of the K\u00e4hler cone that is\ndual to the basis of the Mori cone, l(k) . To find the intersection numbers one has to\nconstruct the ring of polynomials orthogonal to the ideal generated by lim\u03c6\u21920 Lk (\u03b8, \u03c6).\nThe top elements of this ring encode the \u03baijk [40]. In our example, we obtain\n\u03ba122 = 4, \u03ba222 = 5\n\n(29)\n\nand all other \u03baijk = 0. A non-trivial check of our results is the computation of the\nEuler characteristic of M(86,2) [40]:\n!\n2\n7\n2\n1 X X (i) (j) (k) X (i) (j) (k)\nl l l +\n\u03baijk = 168,\n(30)\nl l l\n\u03c7(M(86,2) ) = \u2212\n3 i,j,k=1 \u03b2=1 0\u03b2 0\u03b2 0\u03b2 \u03b1=1 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u03b1\nwhich agrees with \u03c7 = 2(h1,1 \u2212 h2,1 ).\n15\n16\n\nSince we have a nef partition, the sum goes over the l(k) related to the vertices in E\u03b2 . See [40].\nThe solutions to the PF equations are the same for all constants a and b.\n\n11\n\n\f3.2\n\nPeriods and monodromies\n\nThe fundamental period \u03c90 is calculated using the Laurent polynomials of the manifold (15,16).

We need to find the\nresidue of the integrand, which is the constant term in f11f2 . This term can be found\nusing the Mori generators.

Since \u03c6i = 0 is a regular\nsingular point of the PF equations, this is the only power series solution near this\npoint [41]. All other solutions contain logarithmic singularities; we obtain two periods\nwith one logarithm, two periods with double logarithms and one period with triple\nlogarithms.

Note\nthat the intersection numbers (29), related to the leading parts of the PF operators\nwhen \u03c6i \u2192 0, determine the linear combinations of \u2202\u03c1k \u03c9|\u03c1=0 that solve the equations.\nNaturally, linear combinations of these periods yield other solutions. For our\npurpose of computing the monodromies of M(86,2) , it is interesting to find a basis\nof periods which has integral and symplectic monodromy matrices. Furthermore, we\nwould like to find a basis of periods that is symplectic with a canonical symplectic\nmetric, as described in appendix A.\nIt was discovered in [39, 40] that such a basis can be constructed, again using\ntoric geometry. How to do this explicitly is clearly described in [42]. We start by\n(2)\nchoosing a basis of H even (M(86,2) , Q): 1, Jk , Jl , J (3) are forms of degree 0,2,4 and 6\nrespectively that fulfill\nZ\n(3)\n(1, J ) =\n1 \u2227 J (3) = \u22121\nM(86,2)\n\n(2)\n(Jk , Jj )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n(37)\n\nJk \u2227\n\n(2)\nJj\n\n= \u03b4kj .\n\nM(86,2)\n(1)\n\nA canonical symplectic basis of even forms is then found by shifting Jk \u2192 Jk =\n\u2227Jk\n, where c2 is the second Chern class of the manifold [42]. This basis is\nJk \u2212 c212\nsymplectic with respect to the skew symmetric form\nZ\nq\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03b1, \u03b2i =\n\u03b1 \u2227 (\u22121)p \u03b2 \u2227 Todd(M(86,2) ),\n(38)\nM(86,2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are 2q- and 2p-forms on M(86,2) , respectively. The Todd class for\nM(86,2) is given by\nTodd(M(86,2) ) = 1 + c1 +\n\n1 2\n1\n(c1 + c2 ) + c1 c2 ,\n12\n24\n\n(39)\n\nwhere ci is the ith Chern class of M(86,2) .

Expanding the periods calculated in section 3 close to this\nlocus will enable us to match periods between the two manifolds. In doing this, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that there are periods that vanish on the mirror quintic\nlocus. To make the matching unique we must make use of the symplectic structure\nor, equivalently, of the monodromies around the locus.\nSpecifically, as we explain more thoroughly in section 5, one three-cycle17 A of\nH3 (M(86,2) , Z) shrinks as we approach the mirror quintic. Its dual B becomes a\nthree-chain as the two-spheres are blown up. The cycle B transforms nontrivially as\nthe mirror quintic locus is encircled, and neither A nor B should intersect the cycles\ncorresponding to the mirror quintic periods.\n\n4.1\n\nThe mirror quintic locus\n\nApproaching the mirror quintic locus means sending \u03c61 \u2192 1 and \u03c62 \u2192 0 in such a\nway that \u03c62 (1 \u2212\u03c61 )\u22124 \u2192 0 while \u03c61 \u03c62 (1 \u2212\u03c61 )\u22125 remains finite. To see this, we use the\nalternative description of M(86,2) provided in [38], where this locus is determined. If\n17\n\nSee appendix A for notations.\n\n15\n\n\fwe eliminate the variables t1 and t2 in favor of t1 t2 in the first equation of (15) using\n(16), and make the change of variables and coefficients\nu1 = t3 ,\nb0 = 1 \u2212 a1 a6 ,\nb4 = \u2212a1 a7 ,\n\nu2 = t4 ,\nb1 = \u2212a2 ,\nb5 = \u2212a5 a6 ,\n\nu3 = t5 ,\nb2 = \u2212a3 ,\nb6 = \u2212a5 a7\n\nu4 = t1 t2\nb3 = \u2212a4 ,\n\n(47)\n\nwe obtain\nb0 + b1 u1 + b2 u2 + b3 u3 + b4 u4 +\n\nb6\nb5\n+\n= 0.\nu1 u2 u3 u4 u1 u2 u3\n\n(48)\n\nThis is, up to notation, identical to equation (5.13) of [38]. The mirror quintic locus\nis b6 = 0. Natural coordinates on moduli space are, from this point of view,\nz1 =\n\nb1 b2 b3 b6\n\u03c62\n=\n4\nb0\n(1 \u2212 \u03c61 )4\n\n(49)\n\nb1 b2 b3 b4 b5\n\u03c61 \u03c62\n=\n.\n(50)\n5\nb0\n(1 \u2212 \u03c61 )5\nIn the patch described by these coordinates the mirror quintic locus is z1 = 0. We\nnow turn to finding expressions for the periods valid close to this locus.\nz2 = \u2212\n\n4.2\n\nThe fundamental period\n\nLet us begin with the fundamental period for which it is possible to arrive at a very\nsimple expression in terms of the variables (z1 , z2 ). The period is\n\u03c90 = (1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\n= (1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\n\nX (n1 + 4n2 )!(n1 + n2 )!\n\u03c6n1 1 \u03c6n2 2 =\n2\n5\n(n1 !)

Using the analytical continuation\nof 2 F1 given in 15.3.4 of [43] we have\n2 F1 (4n2\n\n+ 1, n2 + 1; 1; \u03c61) = (1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\u22124n2 \u22121 2 F1 (4n2 + 1, \u2212n2 ; 1;\n= (1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\n\n\u22124n2 \u22121\n\nn2\nX\n\nm2\n\n(4n2 + m2 )!n2 !\n(4n2 )!(n2 \u2212 m2 )!(m2 !)2\n=0\n\n18\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c61\n1 \u2212 \u03c61\n\n\u03c61\n)=\n\u03c61 \u2212 1\n\u0013m2\n.\n\n(53)\n(54)\n\nNote that it is always possible to rescale \u03a9, and hence the periods, by a holomorphic function\nof the moduli.\n\n16\n\n\fThe expansion of the 2 F1 terminates since n2 is a nonnegative integer. Therefore we\ncan replace n2 in favor of m1 = n2 \u2212 m2 in the sum representing \u03c90 , and thus obtain\n\u03c90 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm1 ,m2\n\n(4m1 + 5m2 )!\nz1m1 z2m2 .\n3\n2\n((m1 + m2 )!) m1 !(m2 !)\n=0\n\n(55)\n\nThe expansion (55) can be shown to be convergent for at least |zi | < 5\u22123 9\u22123 . Taking\nz1 \u2192 0 we recover the fundamental period of the mirror quintic [22] with z2 = (5\u03c8)\u22125 :\n\u03c90 (z1 = 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nm2\n\n4.3\n\n(5m2 )!\n.\n(m2 !)5 (5\u03c8)5m2\n=0\n\n(56)\n\nThe other periods\n\nFor the other periods it is difficult to find explicit expansions in the variables (z1 , z2 ),\nso we just study their values at the mirror quintic locus and their monodromies.\nThe strategy is to analytically continue the 2 F1 from \u03c61 \u223c 0 to \u03c61 \u223c 1 using standard identities. To construct the five additional periods we need the following six\nderivatives\n\u2202\u03c11 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c12 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c12 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c122 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c122 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c132 \u03c9,\n(57)\nwith\n\u03c9(\u03c1, \u03c6) = (1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\n\nX \u0393(\u00f11 + 4\u00f12 + 1)\u0393(\u00f11 + \u00f12 + 1)\n\u03c6\u00f11 1 \u03c6\u00f12 2 .\n2 (\u00f1 + 1)\u03935 (\u00f1 + 1)\n\u0393\n1\n2\nn ,n\n1\n\n(58)\n\n2\n\nFor brevity we defined \u00f1i = ni + \u03c1i . Note that \u03c9(0, \u03c6) = \u03c90 (\u03c6)\nLet us start with the three derivatives containing \u2202\u03c11 . Differentiating once, evaluating at \u03c11 = 0 and using identity 15.3.10 of [43] we obtain\n\u03932 (4\u00f12 + 1)\n\u00f12\n2 F1 (4\u00f12 + 1, \u00f12 + 1; 5\u00f12 + 2; 1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\u03c62 .\n3\n\u0393(5\u00f12 + 2)\u0393 (\u00f12 + 1)\nn2 =0\n(59)\nThe above equation is an expansion in (1 \u2212 \u03c61 ) and \u03c62 , both of which go to zero as\nwe approach the mirror quintic. Because of the overall factor (1 \u2212 \u03c61 ) there is no\nconstant term, and differentiating with respect to \u03c12 will not change that. Thus all\nthe derivatives \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9, \u2202\u03c12 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9 and \u2202\u03c122 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9 vanish at the mirror quintic locus. These\nfunctions will, however, have monodromies around this locus. This is because each\n\u2202\u03c12 that acts on \u03c6\u00f12 2 produces a factor ln \u03c62 = 5 ln(z1 ) \u2212 4 ln(z1 + z2 ). It turns out\nthat we need only the behavior of \u2202\u03c12 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9. Carrying out the differentiation yields\n\u2202\u03c11 \u03c9(\u03c12 ) = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03c61 )\n\nX\n\n\u2202\u03c11 \u03c9 \u223c 0,\n\u2202\u03c12 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9 \u223c ln \u03c62 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9.\n\n(60)\n\nHere all terms off the mirror quintic locus that do not contain logarithms are ignored.\nFor the three derivatives containing only \u2202\u03c12 we can take \u03c11 = 0 and identify the n1\n17\n\n\fsum as a hypergeometric function exactly as in (52). Then, using 15.3.6 of [43] it is\nstraightforward to obtain.\nX \u0393(5\u00f12 + 1)\n\u03c9=\n(z + z2 )\u00f12 2 F1 (\u22124\u00f12 , \u2212\u00f12 ; \u22125\u00f12 ; 1 \u2212 \u03c61 ) \u2212 f (\u03c12 )\u2202\u03c11 \u03c9,\n(61)\n5 (\u00f1 + 1) 1\n\u0393\n2\nn\n2\n\nwhere\n\nsin(\u03c0\u03c12 ) sin(4\u03c0\u03c12 )\n.\n(62)\n\u03c0 sin(5\u03c0\u03c12 )\nDifferentiated with respect to \u03c12 and evaluated at \u03c61 = 1 and z1 = 0, the first term\nof (61) yields exactly the four mirror quintic periods. As before, the second term and\nall its derivatives vanish at the mirror quintic locus, but transform nontrivially under\ntransport around it. Taking the derivatives yields\nf (\u03c12 ) =\n\n\u2202\u03c12 \u03c9 \u223c \u2202\u03c12 \u03c9 M Q ,\n\n8\n\u2202\u03c122 \u03c9 \u223c \u2202\u03c122 \u03c9 M Q \u2212 \u2202\u03c12 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9,\n(63)\n5\n12\n\u2202\u03c132 \u03c9 \u223c \u2202\u03c132 \u03c9 M Q \u2212 \u2202\u03c122 \u2202\u03c11 \u03c9,\n5\nwhere \u03c9 M Q = \u03c9(\u03c11 = 0; z1 = 0).

Some of these cases have been well-studied\nin the literature; others are less understood.\n\n5.1\n\nGeometric transition: absence of fluxes\n\nLet us first describe in some detail what happens to the homology of the manifold\nin the case where we make a geometric transition from M(86,2) to the mirror quintic\nM(101,1) without any fluxes on the relevant cycles. This discussion is exactly the\nmirror of the more familiar story for the ordinary quintic [17, 38].\nIn the transition, one three-homology class disappears. However, to obtain the\nright Hodge numbers we actually need sixteen three-spheres to shrink. We will denote\nthese three-spheres by Ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 16. Since they are all in the same homology class,\nthere are fifteen homology relations of the form\nA1 \u2212 A2 = \u03b4D1\n\n***\n\nA15 \u2212 A16 = \u03b4D15\n\n(73)\n\nwhere the Di are four-chains with boundary.\nFor symmetry reasons it is useful to\nP15\ninclude a sixteenth four-chain D16 = \u2212 i=1 Di in the discussion, so that A16 \u2212 A1 =\n\u03b4D16 . Finally, we have also to consider a cycle B in the homology class dual to the\nclass A that the {Ai }'s belong to. This cycle will intersect the shrinking ones with\nintersection number 1:\nAi \u2229 B = 1.\n(74)\nWe have drawn the different cycles and chains in figure 2a.\nIn the transition (see figure 2b) all sixteen Ai shrink to points, and then get\nblown up into two-spheres ai . These are not homologically independent but form the\nboundary of B:\nX\n\u03b4B =\nai\n(75)\n20\n\n\fFigure 2: The familiar picture of a geometric transition on a single node: the S 3 denoted by\nAi shrinks, and the S 2 denoted by ai blows up. In our example, sixteen of those transitions\noccur simultaneously.\n\nConversely, the Di lose their boundaries and now become closed:\n\u03b4Di = 0\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 16\n(76)\nP\nOf course, we still have that\nDi = 0, so the sixteen cycles Di actually represent\nfifteen homology classes. The relations (73) now turn into intersection relations:\nD1 \u2229 a\uf731 = 1,\nD2 \u2229 a\uf732 = 1,\n\nD1 \u2229 a\uf732 = \u22121\n...\n\n(77)\n(78)\n\nand so on.\nSummarizing, we see that we lose two dual three-homology classes A and B,\ncorresponding to one complex structure modulus, and we gain fifteen two-homology\nclasses ai and fifteen four-homology classes Di , corresponding to fifteen K\u00e4hler moduli.\nFinally, the Picard\u2013Lefschetz formula (see for example [44]) says that\nB\u2192B+\n\n16\nX\ni=1\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(B \u2229 A )A = B \u2212\n\n16\nX\ni=1\n\nAi\n\n(79)\n\nunder transport around the transition locus in moduli space, where the cycles Ai\nshrink. Thus, the homology classes transform as B \u2192 B \u2212 16A. This explains the\nappearance of the number 16 in (65).\n\n5.2\n\nGeometric Transition: presence of fluxes\n\nWe now discuss what happens in a geometric transition if we turn on fluxes through\nthe relevant cycles Ai and B. There are three different cases; in some it is clear what\nhappens, in others it is less so.\ni. Only flux through the Ai -cycles.\n21\n\n\fFigure 3: The case with flux through the shrinking Ai -cycles. The green line is the cycle,\n\nthe red line is the magnetic flux. As the Ai -cycles shrink the flux line is cut open. When\nthe two-spheres blow up, five-branes (blue dots) appear, charging the flux. (Note that a\nzero-dimensional boundary automatically consists of two points; in the conifold case every\nconifold will of course give rise to only one brane.)\n\nThis case has been well-studied in the literature [45, 46]. After the geometric transition, we find branes wrapped on the cycles ai . If we start with a single unit of NS-flux\nthrough Ai , then after the transition we will find a single NS5-brane wrapping each\nof the ai and stretching throughout space-time. These branes are now the sources for\nthe magnetic flux of the three-form field strength. In a lower-dimensional analogue,\nwe can think of the magnetic field lines as having been \"cut open\" \u2013 see figure 3 for\na cartoon. Similarly, if we start with a single unit of RR-flux through Ai , we end up\nwith D5-branes on ai .\nWe encounter a complication when we want to compute the mirror quintic potential for this case, however. When we come back to the mirror quintic side, in the\npresence of the five-branes, the closed string moduli are no longer the only moduli\nof the system. In particular, as was explained in [47, 48, 49, 50] (see [51] for a good\nreview), there will be some new open string moduli t\u03b1 describing the the positions\nof the branes in A. These moduli appear\nP in a new period, which is the holomorphic\nvolume of the chain B with boundary\nai :\nZ\n\u03a0B (t\u03b1 , z2 ) =\n\u03a9,\n(80)\nB\n\nwhere the z2 is the closed string modulus. Just like the periods of the closed cycles,\nthis period contributes to the four-dimensional superpotential:\nWB (t\u03b1 , z2 ) = N\u03a0B ,\n\n(81)\n\nwhere N is the number of five-branes.\nBecause of this complication, in our explicit calculations we consider the case\nwhere we get no five-branes after the transition. It would of course be very interesting\nto extend our calculations to the full case including five-branes.\nAn interesting possibility of the appearance of five-branes is that we can now\nconstruct domain walls between configurations with and without five-branes. We will\nbriefly discuss this issue in subsection 5.4.\nii. Only flux through the B-cycle.\n22\n\n\fFigure 4: The case with flux through the tearing B-cycle. The green line is the cycle, the\n\nred line is the flux. After the geometric transition the flux goes through a chain. This flux\nis possibly charged by one-instantons (blue dots).\n\nNext, we discuss the case where we only have flux through the dual cycle B of the\nvanishing\ncycle, but no flux through the vanishing cycle itself. In this case, since\nR\nF(3) \u2227 H(3) = 0, the flux does not represent any D3-brane charge, so there is no\nconservation condition that forces the nucleation of e.g. D3-branes.\nFurthermore, as we show in the next subsection, the contribution to the scalar\npotential from this kind of flux vanishes at the transition locus. Therefore, we expect\nno problems when going through the geometric transition.19\nIt is possible that the flux remains on the other side of the transition, sourced\nby electrically charged D1-instantons or F1-instantons on the blown up two-spheres.\n(See [53] for a recent discussion on D1-instantons in geometric transitions.) A cartoon\nof this scenario is given in figure 4. When there is no flux through the Ai -cycles (that\nis, no D5-branes are present after the transition), these instantons do not contribute\nto the (super)potential on the resolved side.\nFor these reasons, this case is under much more control then the case (i), and it\nis the one which we will study in our example in section 6.\niii. Flux through the Ai - and B-cycles.\nThis is the most complicated scenario. We will not make any rigorous claims about\nwhat happens, but let us discuss some possible outcomes.\nFirst of all, as we mentioned in (i), it is natural to assume that the Ai -fluxes turn\ninto five-branes around ai . To picture the fate of the fluxes through B, one suggestion\ncomes from the well-known Klebanov\u2013Strassler setup [54]. In this case, one studies\nthe deformed conifold, which is a non-compact Calabi\u2013Yau manifold with a compact\nthree-cycle A that shrinks, and a dual non-compact three-cycle B. There are N\nunits of RR-flux through the A-cycle, and M units on NS-fluxRthrough the B-cycle.\nThe total D3 charge coming from the three-flux background ( F(3) \u2227 H(3) ) and the\npresence of D3-branes and orientifold three-planes must be conserved and therefore\nbe equal on the two sides of the transition. In particular, the above mentioned fluxes\npiercing the A- and B-cycles give a contribution K = MN to the total charge.\nAfter the transition, the deformed conifold becomes a resolved conifold, which has\na new two-cycle a instead of the three-cycle A. One now finds N D5-branes on a, as\n19\n\nIndeed, it has been argued [52] that, after the geometric transition, no fluxes or branes whatsoever remain. We thank S. Kachru for useful discussions on this case and on the case (iii).\n\n23\n\n\fcould be expected from the case (i). Moreover, the contribution to the total charge,\npreviously coming from the fluxes, now comes from K = MN new D3-branes that\nfill the perpendicular space-time.\nIn our compact case, the sixteen nodes locally look like conifolds, so a first possibility is that the same thing happens: if we have N units of RR-flux through the Ai\nand M units of NS-flux through B, we will find N D5-branes on the ai and K = MN\nspace-time filling D3-branes after the transition, so that the charge conservation condition is satisfied.\nWith case (ii) in mind one might instead expect that the fluxes remain, charged by\nboth five-branes and one-instantons. This situation could either be stable, or decay\ninto the D3-brane configuration described above.\nWe may also wonder what happens to fluxes that do not contribute to the total\nD3-brane charge. For example, we could have some RR-flux through Ai , and some\nRR-flux through B as well. As in case (i) the flux through Ai will result in fivebranes. However, no D3-branes will be generated, and as in (ii), we might conjecture\nthat after the transition, either the fluxes through B completely disappear or remain\ncharged by one-instantons. It would be interesting to investigate these possibilities\nfurther.\nFinally, we note that also in this case, as in (i), there will be new open-string\nmoduli in the theory after the transition. For this reason, we will not treat this case\nin our explicit calculations below.\n\n5.3\n\nThe scalar potential\n\nFluxes piercing the cycles of M(86,2) induce a potential for the two complex structure\nmoduli. It is important to know the properties of this potential to fully understand\nthe geometric transition between M(86,2) and the mirror quintic. In particular, we\nneed to study the behavior of the potential as we approach the transition locus z1 = 0\nin the complex structure moduli space of M(86,2) . (See [55] for an in-depth study of\nsimilar issues.)\nWe expand the periods near z1 = 0 and, with a convenient notation, obtain the\nleading order behavior\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c01 (z2 ) + O(z1 )\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c02 (z2 ) + O(z1 )\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c0\n(z\n)\n+\nO(z\n)\n3\n2\n1\n\uf8f7.\n\u03a0(z1 , z2 ) \u223c \uf8ec\n(82)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c04 (z2 ) + O(z1 )\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nz1 \u03c05 (z2 ) + O(z12 )\n16\n2\n\u03c06 (z2 ) \u2212 2\u03c0i z1 ln(z1 )\u03c05 (z2 ) + O(z1 ln(z1 ))\nThe no-scale potential20 is given by\n\nV (z, \u03c4 ) = eK g i\u0131\u0304 Di W D\u0131\u0304 W + g \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 D\u03c4 W D\u03c4\u0304 W\n20\n\nSee Appendix A for notations.\n\n24\n\n\u0001\n\n(83)\n\n\fwhere W is the superpotential and K is the K\u00e4hler potential.\nKeeping only the leading terms for z1 \u2192 0, we find that the potential is given by\nV = V1 + V2 , where:\nV1 (z1 , z2 ) \u2261 eK (g 11\u0304 D1 W D1\u0304 W )|z1 \u21920\n\u0010\n\u0011\nV2 (z2 ) \u2261 eK g 22\u0304 D2 W D2\u0304 W + g \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 D\u03c4 W D\u03c4\u0304 W |z1 \u21920 .\n\n(84)\n(85)\n\nNote that terms containing g 12\u0304 and g 1\u03042 are subleading. This potential has different\nproperties, depending on the presence of fluxes piercing different cycles. In particular:\n\u2022 if there is flux F6 , H6 through the shrinking cycle, the potential has an infinite\nspike at the conifold locus. At leading order we obtain:\nV1 \u223c ln |z1 |\n\n1\n|F6 \u2212 \u03c4 H6 |2 |\u03c05 (z2 )|2 .\n|\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 |\n\n(86)\n\n\u2022 if there is no F6 nor H6 , but flux F5 , H5 through B we obtain:\nV1 \u223c\n\n1\n1\n|F5 \u2212 \u03c4 H5 |2 |\u03c05 (z2 )|2\nln |z1 | |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u0304 |\n\n(87)\n\nand this part of the potential goes to zero at the conifold locus.21 This is a\ngeneral behavior for all compactifications on Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds which have\nconifold singularities, as noted in [14].\nThis flux dependence of the potential fits well with the expected behavior within\na geometric transition with different fluxes. V2 is the part of the potential that is\ncreated by fluxes wrapping the mirror quintic cycles. Thus it gives the \"ordinary\"\nflux potential for the complex structure modulus z2 on the mirror quintic. V1 captures\nthe dependence of the flux through the shrinking and torn cycles A and B, giving\ndifferent scenarios.\nLet us start with the case having flux through the shrinking cycle A in M(86,2) , but\nnot through the torn one B. As discussed in section 5.2, there will be contributions\nfrom five-branes to the potential for the mirror quintic when we go through the\nconifold transition. The behavior of the M(86,2) potential agrees with this. Indeed,\nif F6 or H6 are non-zero there are non-vanishing terms left in V1 , even after setting\nz1 = 0. We even find an infinite spike. When moving away from the conifold point\nin the K\u00e4hler moduli space of the mirror quintic, it is plausible that the new terms\nbecome finite and match the terms coming from a five-brane contribution. As a side\nremark, it is tempting to think of the open string moduli of the branes as a remnant\nof the complex structure modulus that one loses.\nOn the other hand, if there is zero flux through the A cycle, but a non-zero one\nthrough the B cycle, the terms that remain as z1 \u2192 0 in the M(86,2) potential match\n21\n\nIf we minimize the potential with respect to the axio-dilaton \u03c4 at the conifold locus, we find the\nresult of [14], i.e. V1 \u223c \u221a 1\n.\nKz 1 z 1\n\n25\n\n\fthe terms on the mirror quintic side. Assuming that we do not generate other terms\nmoving in the K\u00e4hler moduli space of the mirror quintic, there is no need for extra\nbranes after the transition.\nFinally, when we have fluxes through both A and B, or only through A, we\nfind terms in V1 which remain finite in the limit z1 \u2192 0. It is natural to assume\nthat they will also be present after the transition, and will vary in a continuous\nmanner as a function of the K\u00e4hler moduli of the mirror quintic. As mentioned in\nthe previous subsection, it is not clear what the physical description of the system\nafter the transition should be, but it would be an interesting test of any proposal for\nsuch a description to see if it reproduces these terms in the appropriate limit.\n\n5.4\n\nFlux on the vanishing cycle: domain walls\n\nIf there is a flux on the vanishing three-cycle, our calculations show that the potential\nblows up as we approach the mirror quintic locus (see equation (86)). That is, as the\nthree-spheres contract, the potential grows. Going through the geometric transition,\nthe vanishing three-spheres are replaced by vanishing two-spheres, and the flux is\nreplaced by five-branes wrapping the two-cycles, as discussed above.\nIt is natural to expect that there is a corresponding growth in the potential if\nwe approach the locus from the side of the mirror quintic, this time due to the\nvanishing two-cycles wrapped by five-branes. We therefore conclude that if all effects\nfrom closed and open string moduli are included, there will be a contribution to the\npotential on the mirror quintic side that is inversely proportional22 to the volume of\nthe appropriate two-cycles. The picture we have in mind is that of a spike in the\npotential, separating the phase of the mirror quintic with five-branes and the phase\nof the M(86,2) with fluxes.\nIt is interesting to speculate on the possibility of actually penetrating through the\nspike separating the two phases. Classically this would be possible if the spike is cut\noff at a finite height by effects due to stringy and non-perturbative physics. If this\nis indeed what happens, there is a possibility of obtaining domain walls separating\nregions with and without wrapped five-branes. (See [53] for a recent discussion on\ntransitions between phases with and without branes.)\nLet us start with the mirror quintic without five-branes, and then move through\nthe K\u00e4hler moduli space toward the appropriate transition locus that takes us to\nthe M(86,2) . Without five-branes there is no prominent barrier that prevents us from\ndoing this. We then encircle an appropriate locus resulting in a monodromy that\ngenerates flux through the vanishing cycle. The monodromy obtained in (70) is an\nexample of such a monodromy, as we will see in more detail in the next section.\nWhen we then go back toward the mirror quintic locus, we find a high barrier that we\nneed to cross. In contrast to the situation we started with, we now have five-branes\nextending through space-time and wrapping internal two-cycles.\n22\n\nIt is clear that the potential should grow. For arguments as to why it should grow with the\ninverse volume, see [56].\n\n26\n\n\fWe can use this idea to construct domain walls. Let us take one space-time\ndirection, say the x-direction, and put our system in the phase without five-branes\nin the region x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and in the phase with five-branes in the region x \u2192 \u221e. In\nbetween these regions, the system will change in a continuous manner, which will be\nexactly described by our path through moduli space. That is, macroscopically, we\nwill see a domain wall with five-branes ending on one of its sides. Microscopically,\nwe have a barrier whose profile is described by the potential as a function of the\ncontinuous path through moduli space.\nWe can also speculate on the possibility of tunneling from one side to the other.\nThis would be relevant for tunneling between minima connected by paths in moduli\nspace going through the geometric transition. It is interesting to note that a rough\nestimate of the tunneling amplitude gives the result\ne\u2212\n\nR\u221a\n\ngV (\u03c6)\n\n= e\u2212\n\nR \u03c6i \u221a\nln \u03c6 ln \u03c6\n0\n\n\u223c finite\n\n(88)\n\neven without a regularization of the singular point \u03c6 = 0. Assuming that there is no\ndramatic difference on the K\u00e4hler side of the spike we see that there is good reason\nto expect a finite tunneling amplitude.\nIn the next section we return to the more solid ground of the case with no flux on\nthe vanishing cycle.\n\n6\n\nInfinite series of minima\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, monodromy transformations create continuous paths\nbetween minima of the flux-induced potential in Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications [14].\nThe transformations take us between minima corresponding to different fluxes. Here\nwe investigate the length of such series of minima. We would like to understand\nif infinite series of continuously connected minima are a topographic feature of our\nmodel of the string theory landscape.23\nIn [14], it was found that infinite series of minima do exist in compactifications on\nthe mirror quintic, but it was unclear if these series can be connected by monodromy\ntransformations. We now use geometric transitions to reach the moduli space of\nM(86,2) . In this way, we obtain new monodromies, creating new continuous paths\nbetween minima. As we now explain, these new transformations yield infinite series\nof continuously connected minima.\n23\n\nAs discussed in the introduction, we are only studying minima of the potential created by\nfluxes. These will be vacua in the string theory landscape if the K\u00e4hler moduli are stabilized and\nthe back-reaction of the fluxes on the manifold can be neglected.\n\n27\n\n\f6.1\n\nGeneral considerations\n\nIn order to find a series of minima we are interested in monodromies T such that the\nvector of flux quanta24 transforms as\nFn = F0 T n = F0 + nFL ,\n\n(89)\n\nwhich is achieved using a monodromy matrix of the form\nT = 1 + \u0398,\n\n(90)\n\nwhere \u03982 = 0 and F0 \u0398 = FL . For simplicity we will impose\nHn = HL ,\n\n(91)\n\nwith HL \u0398 = 0. If there is a minimum to the potential induced by the flux vectors FL\nand HL , it follows that a series of fluxes Fn and HL provide us with an infinite series\nof minima that asymptotes to the minimum given by FL and HL [14].\nAs is well-known, the total charge on a compact manifold M must be zero. The\nthree-form-fluxes, F(3) and H(3) , yield a three-brane charge, that must be compensated\nby charges from three-branes and orientifold planes [20]:\nZ\nF(3) \u2227 H(3) + QD3 \u2212 QO3 = 0.\n(92)\nM\n\nR\nIf the fluxes are changed in a way that alters M F(3) \u2227 H(3) = F * Q * H \u2261 F \u2227 H,\nthe number of three-branes and orientifold planes must adjust in order to keep this\ntadpole condition satisfied. This requires the use of new physics, e.g. the nucleation\nof branes.\nOn the other hand, if we demand that FL \u2227 HL = 0, the series of minima will have\na constant Fn \u2227 Hn leaving the tadpole condition unchanged. Thus, in this case, there\nis no need to nucleate branes. This was the situation studied in [14] and is what we\nwill focus on here.\nLet us study the properties of the monodromy matrix T = 1 + \u0398. Assume that\nthe rank of \u0398 is r. We can then write\n\u0398=\n\nr\nX\n\n\u0398(i)\n\n(93)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere\n\n(i)\n\n(i) (i)\n\n\u0398kl = bk al ,\n\n(94)\n\b (i)\n\b (i)\nwith b\nand a\neach being a set of r linearly independent vectors. It follows\n2\nfrom \u0398 = 0 that\nb(i) * a(j) = 0 \u2200 i, j = 1..r,\n(95)\n24\n\nOur notation is explained in appendix A.\n\n28\n\n\fand we see from\nF0 \u0398 =\n\nr\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0001\nF0 * b(i) a(i) = FL ,\n\n(96)\n\n\b\nthat FL necessarily lies is in the r-dimensional subspace spanned by a(i) . If the\ndimensionality of the flux space is 2d, it is obvious that we must have r 6 d.\n\b (i)The difficult part is now to find a monodromy T = 1 + \u0398 such that the space\na\nactually does contain flux vectors giving rise to a minimum. In [14], for the case\nof the mirror quintic, we were able to find transformations with the right property\nbut unable to show that they were monodromies. Let us now examine whether the\nextension of the moduli space to the M(86,2) changes the situation.\n\n6.2\n\nSeries of minima in mirror quintic compactifications\n\nIn section 4 we generalized the action of the two independent monodromies on periods\nfor the mirror quintic to periods of the M(86,2) . We also found two new monodromies.\nInterestingly, our new monodromies are precisely of the form discussed in the previous\nsubsection. For T2 = 1 + \u03982 we find the rank three matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0 \u22122 0 \u22121\n\uf8ec 0 0 \u22124 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 0 0\n0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\n(97)\n\u03982 = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 0 0\n1 0 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nconsistent with\n\na(1) = (0, 0, 0, \u22122, 0, \u22121) b(1) = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\na(2) = (0, 0, \u22124, 0, 0, 0)\nb(2) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)\na(3) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)\nb(3) = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0) .\n\n(98)\n\nIn addition to the conditions (95) it is easy to check that also\na(i) \u2227 a(j) = 0 \u2200 i, j = 0..3\n\nb(i) \u2227 b(j) = 0 \u2200 i, j = 0..3.\n\n(99)\n(100)\n\nThe first of these statements makes sure that FL \u2227 HL = 0 is automatic if FL and HL\nlie in the space spanned by the\b a(i) .\n\b\nWe now need to find FL \u2208 a(i) and HL \u2208 a(i) such that when we restrict the\nflux vectors to the four dimensional mirror quintic flux space, there is a minimum of\nthe potential. If we can achieve this we have found an infinite series of continuously\nconnected minima, even though we have to make geometric transitions to M(86,2) and\nback again when we pass from one minimum to the next.\nWe have not been able to find any minima using the T2 = 1 + \u03982 above. However,\nby the use of the monodromy matrices T0 and T1 , we can rotate the space spanned\n29\n\n\fF = (1, 1, 0, \u22122) H = (5, 7, 2, \u22128), \u2202\u03c4 V=0\n\n1.2\n\n1.15\n\nV\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\nIm(z)\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3\n\nRe(z)\n\nFigure 5: The flux-induced potential V plotted on the complex structure moduli space\nof the mirror quintic.

The flux vectors are examples of fluxes\nobtained by applying the monodromy T\u0303 = 1 + \u0398\u0303 many times.

However, if we want to make sure that we can easily go through the\ngeometric transition, there are further restrictions on the flux. The flux that pierces\nthe shrinking cycle induces a potential barrier at the transition locus, as discussed\nin subsection 5.3. This corresponds to the generation of five-branes in the geometric\ntransition. Thus, in order to have a potential that is under full control, the flux\nthrough the shrinking cycle must vanish. This implies that the last component of the\nflux vector, that is \u2212f1 + f2 \u2212 f3 , is zero, and correspondingly for HL .\nEven with this restriction it is possible to find minima. One example is shown\nin figure 5. The potential in the figure was computed numerically, as described\nin appendix A. The flux configurations, FL = (1, 1, 0, \u22122) and HL = (5, 7, 2, \u22128),\ncorrespond to limiting fluxes obtained after many transformations with T\u0303 = 1 + \u0398\u0303.\nSince acting with T\u0303 on these fluxes produces a new minimum, we conclude that\ninfinite series of continuously connected minima do exist for our model of the string\ntheory landscape.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nThis work was originally triggered by a question left open in a previous investigation\non the topography of the string landscape [14]. There, the focus was on determining\nthe existence of families of string vacua (possibly metastable) connected through continuous paths in the landscape. The results of that work indicated that the landscape\nconsists of a set of separate \"islands\", such that minima on the same island are connected continuously, but another island could be reached only through disconnected\n\"jumps\". What we have shown in the present paper is how to enlarge the kind of\ntransformations acting on the periods and fluxes of a particular theory, and possibly\ncontinuously connect islands that were not connected within the original setting.\nThe presence of these new transformations follows from the interconnections among\ndifferent models represented by geometric transitions, and represents a natural characteristic of the landscape. In particular, it leads to the discovery of infinite series of\ncontinuously connected minima for type IIB string theory in the mirror quintic. An\nexample of these results can be found in section 6. As we have discussed, we expect\neffects due in particular to the stabilization of the K\u00e4hler moduli, which we do not\ninvestigate, that will shorten these series and make them finite. Nevertheless, the\nexistence of long series of many closely spaced vacua is an interesting topographic\nfeature of the landscape.\n\n31\n\n\fThe possibility of reaching all different islands in the landscape through the use of\nmirror quintic monodromy transformations, is connected with the unresolved problem\nof the finiteness of the index of the monodromy subgroup in Sp(4, Z). Our analysis has\nshown that there exists continuous transformations that connect minima in infinite\nseries if we make use of geometric transitions into a moduli space of larger dimension.\nThe question of whether such transformations can be found in the original setting\nremains unanswered.\nThe picture of the interconnections between different models, that we have exploited in order to investigate the series of minima, represents an interesting result\nin itself. To our knowledge, the complete relation between two models related by\ngeometric transitions has not been made explicit before at the level we do it here. We\nwere able to find the precise map between the complex structure moduli spaces of the\nmirror quintic and the manifold M(86,2) by analysing the behavior of the periods of\nthe latter. This embedding is fully explicit, including the reduction of the monodromy\ntransformations.\nThe analysis was performed neglecting issues regarding K\u00e4hler moduli and backreaction on the geometry, but took into account, even if in some cases at a speculative\nlevel, the presence of all possible flux configurations. On the side of the manifold\nM(86,2) , we are in full control of the scalar potential of the theory, and we can effectively study its behavior in certain limits. When we relate it to the potential of the\nmirror quintic, though, issues regarding the behavior of the fluxes arise.\nThe geometric transition between the two manifolds involves the shrinking of 16\nthree-cycles on the M(86,2) side and the blowing up of the same number of two-cycles\non the mirror quintic one. If no flux pierces any of these cycles, we have a complete\nand fully understood picture of the result of the transformation on the mirror quintic\nside. If we instead have fluxes piercing the shrinking cycles and/or the three-cycle\nthat intersect them, then the picture is more complicated.\nHaving fluxes only on the shrinking cycles will lead to the appearance of D5-branes\nor NS5-branes wrapping the blown-up two-cycles on the mirror quintic side [45, 46]. If\nthe flux pierces only the intersecting cycle, the outcome is less clear. Our results show\nthat, at the mirror quintic locus in the complex structure moduli space of M(86,2) , the\ncontribution to the (super)potential depending on those fluxes vanishes. Therefore,\nthe transition is not hindered by having such flux. In both the above cases we have\nno change in the tadpole condition on the mirror quintic, so no D3-branes need to be\nnucleated in the transition.\nInstead if the fluxes pierce both the shrinking cycles and the intersecting one, the\ntadpole condition will in general change with the nucleation of D3-branes as a result.\nIt is not clear exactly what happens in the present compact case, but it is possible\nthat a similar nucleation of D3-branes as the one happening in the Klebanov\u2013Strassler\nsetup will take place.\nDifferent minima imply the presence of domain walls separating them in space. As\nanalyzed in [14], the appearance of different islands for the mirror quintic leads to the\nconjecture that two different kinds of domain walls exist. One kind separates fluxes\n32\n\n\fthat could be connected through a monodromy transformation for which a profile\ndepending on the complex structure moduli can be derived. The other separates\nislands that cannot be continuously connected and therefore corresponds to branes.\nIn the setup of the present work, we make use of the embedding of the mirror\nquintic moduli space into the moduli space of M(86,2) in order to derive profiles of a\nlarger set of domain walls. What happens is that the moduli change when we cross a\ndomain wall; we leave the mirror quintic moduli space through a geometric transition\nto the M(86,2) , and at the end we come back through another geometric transition to\nthe mirror quintic. With no fluxes on the shrinking cycle we have complete control\nover the domain wall. When there is a flux through the shrinking cycle the situation\nis less clear. If the potential barrier at the geometric transition generated by the flux\nthrough the shrinking cycle is regulated by stringy corrections, then one can expect\nto obtain domain walls separating volumes of space time with different number of\nfive-branes.\nWhat happens to fluxes through a geometric transition is a very interesting open\nquestion. It leaves open new possibilities for finding minima and analysing domain\nwalls through the new terms in the scalar potential generated by the presence of\nthe fluxes. It clearly deserves further investigation, together with the analysis of the\ndynamics of K\u00e4hler moduli and backreaction on the geometry, in order to have a\ncomplete picture.\nOur results and the techniques employed lead to interesting possibilities for future research. First of all, the topographic features of the landscape that we have\nfound (namely long series of closely spaced vacua) represent a good setting for chain\ninflation [57, 58] (see also [59]) and for the resonance tunneling [60]. The techniques\nwe have employed, and further refinements of them, give hope to obtain a quantitative understanding of these phenomena. The same techniques can also be used for\nquantitative study of the domain walls between different minima.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR).

The\nperiods of M are the \"holomorphic volumes\" of a basis of 3-cycles:\nI\nI\n\u03a0I =\n\u03a9=\nCI \u2227 \u03a9.\n(106)\nCI\n\nM\n\nHere \u03a9 is the holomorphic 3-form and CI denotes a basis of H3 (M). Note that\nCI denotes both the cycles and their Poincar\u00e9 duals. The index I runs from 1 to\n2h1,2 (M) + 2 \u2261 N. The intersection matrix Q = (QIJ ) is defined as\nI\nI\nQIJ =\nCJ =\nCI \u2227 CJ .\n(107)\nCI\n\nM\n\nWe will call QIJ canonical if the cycles CI , CJ intersect only pairwise, with intersection\nnumber \u00b11.\nDenoting the cycles corresponding to the \u03a0-basis of section 4 by CI , the cycle\nthat vanishes on the mirror quintic locus is C5 and its dual is C6 . We also refer\nto these cycles by the conventional A and B. The cycle that shrinks at the locus\nintersecting the mirror quintic moduli space in the conifold point of the latter is C1 .\nIt is intersected by the cycle C4 .\nIt is customary and convenient to collect the periods into a vector\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03a01 (z)\n\uf8ec \u03a02 (z) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(108)\n\u03a0(z) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n.\n\u03a0N (z)\nwhere z is an (N/2 \u2212 1)-dimensional (complex) coordinate on M.\nThe periods are subject to monodromies:\n\u03a0 \u2192 T * \u03a0,\n\n(109)\n\nwhere T is a matrix that preserves the symplectic structure Q.

We compute the periods \u03a01 (z), . . . , \u03a04 (z) and their derivatives on a grid in\nmoduli space M using the Maple software package. We use the Meijer-G functions\n26\n\nNote that, with this notation, having e.g., F1 6= 0 does not mean that we have fluxes\nR around\nC1 .

We repeat the formulas here for the reader's convenience. In\nMaple notation we define\nU0\u2212 (z) = MeijerG([[4/5, 3/5, 2/5, 1/5], []], [[0], [0, 0, 0]], \u2212z)\n1\nMeijerG([[4/5, 3/5, 2/5, 1/5], []], [[0, 0], [0, 0]], z)\nU1\u2212 (z) =\n2\u03c0i\n1\nU2\u2212 (z) =\nMeijerG([[4/5, 3/5, 2/5, 1/5], []], [[0, 0, 0], [0]], \u2212z)\n(2\u03c0i)2\n1\nMeijerG([[4/5, 3/5, 2/5, 1/5], []], [[0, 0, 0, 0], []], z),\nU3\u2212 (z) =\n(2\u03c0i)3\n\n(117)\n\nand\nU0+ (z) = U0\u2212 (z)\nU1+ (z) = U1\u2212 (z) + U0\u2212 (z)\nU2+ (z) = U2\u2212 (z)\nU3+ (z) = U3\u2212 (z) + U2\u2212 (z).\n\n(118)\n\nA basis Uj (z) for the mirror quintic periods is then defined by Uj (z) = Uj\u2212 (z) for\nIm(z) < 0 and Uj (z) = Uj+ (z) for Im(z) > 0. The basis Uj is related to the basis \u03a0\nby \u03a0 = LU with\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n5\n0 5\n8i\u03c0 3 \uf8ec\n3 \u22125 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec 0\n(119)\nL=\n0 0 \uf8f8\n125 \uf8ed 0 \u22121\n1\n0\n0 0\n\nThe derivatives of the periods \u2202z \u03a0 needed for computing e.g. Dz W = \u2202z W +(\u2202z K)W\nand Kz z\u0304 can also be obtained as Meijer-G functions and calculated in the same way.\nEquipped with \u03a0(z) and \u2202z \u03a0(z) on a grid in moduli space we use Matlab to\nefficiently compute the potential for a large number of flux vectors. In this way the\nexample of section 6 was found.\n\nReferences\n[1] P. Candelas, G. T. Horowitz, A. Strominger and E. Witten, \"Vacuum Configurations For Superstrings,\" Nucl. Phys.
