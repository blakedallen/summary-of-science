Introduction\nCurvature radiation (CR) and magnetic inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) are usually considered to be the most\nnatural ways of hard gamma-rays production operating\nat the expense of pulsar rotational energy (eg. Zhang &\nHarding 2000, and references therein). These two radiation mechanisms dominate within two different ranges of\nLorentz factors \u03b3 of beam particles (ie. those leaving the\n6\npolar cap). When \u03b3 <\n\u223c 10 , magnetic inverse Compton\nscattering plays a dominant role in braking beam particles (Xia et al. 1985; Chang 1995; Sturner 1995) and is\nthe main source of hard gamma-ray photons (Sturner &\nDermer 1994; Sturner et al. 1995).\n\n6\nWhen \u03b3 >\n\u223c 10 , the curvature radiation becomes responsible for cooling beam particles (eg. Daugherty &\nHarding 1982), yet, the inverse Compton scattering may\nstill be important for secondary e\u00b1 -pair plasma. Zhang &\nHarding (2000) show that different dependencies of X-ray\nand gamma-ray luminosities on the pulsar spin-down luminosity as inferred from observations by CGRO, ROSAT\nand ASCA (Arons 1996; Becker & Tr\u00fcmper 1997; Saito et\nal. 1998, respectively) can be well reproduced when this\neffect is included.\nSo far, the influence of ICS on electron energy have\nbeen investigated most thoroughly by Chang (1995),\nSturner (1995), Harding & Muslimov (1998), and Supper & Tr\u00fcmper (2000). One of several interesting results\nthey found was that energy losses due to resonant ICS\ncan limit the Lorentz factors \u03b3 of electrons to a value\nwhich depends on both electric field strength Ek , temperature T and radius Rth of thermal polar cap, and on\nthe magnetic field strength Bpc at a polar cap. For example Sturner (1995) shows that assuming the acceleration\nmodel of Michel (1974) and a thermal polar cap size comparable to that determined by the open field lines, the\nLorentz factors \u03b3 are limited to \u223c 103 if Bpc > 1013 G,\nand T > 3 \u00d7 106 K. This acceleration stopping effect becomes more efficient for stronger magnetic fields, and it\nled Sturner (1995) to propose it as a possible explanation\nfor an apparent cutoff around 10 MeV in gamma radiation\nof B1509\u221258 (Kuiper et al. 1999).\nThose results were obtained with a numerical method\nwhich assumes smooth changes in electron energy and\nmakes use of expressions for averaged energy losses due to\nthe magnetic ICS (Dermer 1990). The continuous changes\nof the Lorentz factor with height as determined with this\nfully deterministic treatment are considered as representative for a behaviour of a large number of electrons. Actually however, electrons lose their energy in discontinuous\nscattering events. Between some of these events (which occasionally can be very distant even for a short mean free\npath) the energy of an accelerated electron may increase\nconsiderably (even a few times) and therefore, the electron can find itself in quite different conditions than if it\nwere losing its energy continuously (the mean free path\n\n\f2\n\nDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\ndepends very strongly on \u03b3). Since the energy loss rate\ndue to the resonant ICS is not a monotonic function of\n\u03b3 this effect may be essential for future behaviour of the\nparticle.\nThe aim of our paper is to investigate the energetics\nof electrons on individual basis with a Monte Carlo treatment. In particular, a question of the ICS-limited acceleration is adressed. In Section 2 we calculate electron energy\nlosses near a neutron star using both, the Monte Carlo approach and then the smooth method (after Dermer 1990;\nChang 1995; Sturner 1995) for comparison. We consider\ntwo distinct cases of electron acceleration: 1) in the constant electric field, proposed by Michel (1974) (hereafter\nM74); 2) in the electric field elaborated by Harding &\nMuslimov (1998) (hereafter HM98). Section 3 presents the\nresults for electron energetics, and the finding that within\nsome range of pulsars parameters, the averaged Monte\nCarlo behaviour of electrons does not coincide with a solution found with the smooth method. It also contains the\nexplanation of these differences as well as consequences for\npredicted efficiencies of gamma-ray emission. Conclusions\nare given in Sect. 4.\n2. The model\nWe consider electrons accelerated in a longitudinal electric\nfield induced rotationally within the region adjacent to the\nsurface of a neutron star. The particles lose their energy\ndue to scattering off soft thermal X-ray photons through\nmagnetic inverse Compton mechanism and (marginally)\ndue to emission of curvature radiation. The thermal photons are assumed to originate from a flat 'thermal polar\ncap' with a temperature T \u223c a few \u00d7 106 K and with a\n3\nradius Rth \u2243 a few \u00d7 rpc where rpc = (2\u03c0Rns\n/cP )1/2 is\nthe standard polar cap radius as determined for an aligned\nrotator by the open lines of purely dipolar magnetic field;\n(Rns denotes the neutron star radius and P is the pulsar\nperiod).\nSince the ICS losses are to dominate over the curvature losses, one has to ensure that electrons do not attain\nextremely high Lorentz factors (\u03b3 < 106 ). Therefore, either the electric field should be weak or at least the size\nof the accelerating region should be small enough to pre6\nvent \u03b3 >\n\u223c 10 . For this reason most papers focusing on the\nresonant ICS made use of a relatively weak electric field\nafter Michel 1974 (for example: Sturner 1995 and recently\nSupper & Tr\u00fcmper 2000). Michel's model is considered as\nunrealistic since it ignores magnetic field line curvature\n(detailed treatment of this problem was first presented\nby Arons & Scharlemann 1979) as well as inertial frame\ndragging (its importance was acknowledged and the effect\nwas worked out for the first time by Muslimov & Tsygan\n1992). Both effects lead to significantly stronger electric\nfields operating in polar-cap accelerators.\nHowever, for the sake of comparison with previous papers on the resonant ICS we first consider the weak electric\n\nfield after Michel 1974. Accordingly, we assume that electrons are accelerated in a constant Ek extending between\nstellar surface (h = 0) and altitude hacc :\n\nEk =\n\n\uf8f1\u0010\n\u00111/2\n8\u03c0mcBpc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2243\n\uf8f4\neP\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2243 3.58 * 105\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n0,\n\n\u0001\nB12 1/2\nP\n\nV cm\u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\nfor 0 \u2264 h \u2264 hacc ;\nfor h > hacc .\n\nwith hacc = rpc , and where P is in seconds, B12 is Bpc in\nTeragauss. Fixed location of hacc means that the model is\nnot self-consistent in the sense that the accelerating field\nwill not be shorted out by a pair formation front (should\nit occur at a height below hacc = rpc ).\nAs the second case for Ek we take the advanced model\nof an electric field in the form elaborated by Harding &\nMuslimov (1998). HM98 were the first to incorporate electron energy losses due to the ICS in a strong-Ek acceleration model. However, this was done to introduce a high altitude accelerator with negligible resonant ICS losses (an\nidea of an unstable ICS-induced pair formation fronts).\nIn that work Harding and Muslimov also calculated selfconsistent values of the acceleration height hacc using an\naccelerating electric field which takes into account the upper pair formation front (eqs. (18) and (23) in HM98).\nFor hacc <\n\u223c 0.1rpc the field is well approximated with\n\u03a9Rns Bpc\nh hacc\nEk (h) \u2243 3\nc\n1 \u2212 \u01ebGR Rns Rns\n\u00d7 [\u03ba cos \u03c7 + A sin \u03c7] ,\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\n1\u2212\n\u00d7\nhacc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a9 = 2\u03c0/P , (1 \u2212 \u01ebGR ) \u2243 0.6, \u03ba \u2243 0.15, \u03c7 is the angle\nbetween the magnetic dipole and rotation axes, h is the\naltitude, and the factor A sin \u03c7 is negligible for nonorthogonal rotators (see HM98 for details). For hacc approaching\nrpc the linear dependence on hacc in Eq.(2) disappears. We\nhave found that for 0.5rpc <\n\u223c 3rpc and h <\n\u223c rpc /3\n\u223c hacc <\nthe electric field given by eq.(18) in HM98 is well aproximated with a formula\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh rpc\n\u03a9Rns\nBpc\nh\nEk (h) \u2243 3\n1\u2212\n\u00d7\nc\nhacc\n(1 \u2212 \u01ebGR )1/2 Rns Rns\n\u00d7 [\u03ba cos \u03c7 + A sin \u03c7] .\n(3)\nFor purposes of comparison as well as to simplify our\ncalculations, we inject electrons from the center of polar\ncap and propagate them along the straight magnetic axis\nfield line. The propagation proceeds in steps of a size dh,\nwhich is one hundred times smaller than any of characteristic length scales involved in the problem, like the acceleration length scale or the mean free path for the magnetic\nISC. In each of the distance steps the energy of an electron\nis increased by a value eEk dh. For the sake of completeness, we also include the energy loss due to the curvature\n\n\fDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\nradiation |\u03b3\u0307cr |mc2 dh/v where \u03b3\u0307cr is the CR cooling rate\ngiven by\n\u2212 \u03b3\u0307cr =\n\n2e2 \u03b2 4 \u03b3 4\n3mc\u03c12curv\n\n(4)\n\nand v = c\u03b2 is the electron velocity. Nevertheless, the CR\nis a very inefficient cooling mechanism in the presence of\nacceleration models we consider below and it could be\nneglected equally well. When computing energy losses due\nto the CR we assume artificially (after Sturner 1995) that\nthe magnetic axis has a fixed radius of curvature \u03c1curv =\n107 cm, though we keep the electrons all the time directly\nover the polar cap center.\nMagnetic inverse Compton scattering has been treated\nwith a Monte Carlo simulations. The framework of our numerical code is based on an approach proposed by Daugherty & Harding (1989). We improve their method of sampling the parameters of incoming photon and account for\nthe Klein-Nishina regime in an approximate way.\nAt each step in the electron trajectory, the optical\ndepth for magnetic ICS is calculated as d\u03c4 = dhR/c,\nwhere R is a scattering rate, to decide whether a scattering event is to occur.

Ho & Epstein 1989) where \u03a9 = d\u03bcd\u03c6 is the solid angle subtended by the source of soft photons, (\u03bc = cos \u03b8),\n\u03c3 is a total cross section (see below), and dnph /dE /d\u03a9 is\nthe density of the soft photons per unit energy and per\nunit solid angle. The symbol E denotes photon energy in\ndimensional energy units. Hereafter we will use its dimensionless counterpart \u01eb = E /(mc2 ) to denote the photon\nenergy in the observer frame OF and the primed symbol\n\u01eb\u2032 = \u01eb\u03b3(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc) in the electron rest frame ERF.\nFor temperatures of the thermal polar cap and Lorentz\nfactors of electrons considered below, photon energies \u01eb\u2032\nmay fall well above \u01ebB = B/Bcr , a local magnetic field\nstrength in units of the critical magnetic field Bcr =\nm2 c3 (eh\u0304)\u22121 . This suggests a full form of the relativistic\ncross section for Compton scattering in strong magnetic\nfields to be used (Daugherty & Harding 1986). However,\nincoming photons that propagate in the OF at an angle \u03b8 = cos\u22121 \u03bc are strongly collimated in the ERF with\na cosine of polar angle \u03bc\u2032 = (\u03bc \u2212 \u03b2)/(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc) close to\n\u22121. As was shown by Daugherty & Harding (1986), when\n|\u03bc\u2032 | approaches 1, resonances at higher harmonics become\nnarrower and weaker, and scattering into higher Landau\nstates becomes less important. In such conditions, the\npolarization-averaged relativistic magnetic cross section in\nthe Thomson regime is reasonably well approximated with\na nonrelativistic, classical limit:\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0013\ng2 \u2212 g1\n\u03c3T\n\u20322\n\u20322\n1 \u2212 \u03bc + (1 + \u03bc ) g1 +\n(6)\n\u03c3=\n2\n2\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson cross section, and g1 and g2 are\ngiven by\ng1 (u) =\n\nu2\n,\n(u + 1)2\n\ng2 (u) =\n\nu2\n(u \u2212 1)2 + a2\n\n(7)\n\nwith u \u2261 \u01eb\u2032 /\u01ebB , a \u2261 2\u03b1f \u01ebB /3, where \u03b1f is a fine-structure\nconstant (eg. Herold 1979; Dermer 1990).\nIn the Klein-Nishina regime (\u01eb\u2032 >\n\u223c 1) the relativistic magnetic cross section for the |\u03bc\u2032 | \u2248 1 case becomes\nbetter approximated with the well known Klein-Nishina\nrelativistic nonmagnetic total cross section \u03c3KN (Daugherty & Harding 1986; Dermer 1990). When \u01eb\u2032 \u226b \u01ebB , (the\ncondition fulfilled in the K-N regime since \u01ebB < 1 holds\nthroughout this paper), the resonant term (g2 \u2212 g1 )/2 in\nEq. (6) becomes negligible and the nonresonant term g1\napproaches unity which results in \u03c3 \u2248 \u03c3T . Therefore, to\napproximate the Klein-Nishina decline we replace the single nonresonant term g1 in the square bracket of Eq. (6)\nwith \u03c3KN /\u03c3T for \u01eb\u2032 > 2\u01ebB .\nTo make calculations less time-consuming, we have\nused the delta-function approximation for the resonant\npart of the cross section (Dermer 1990), when calculating\nthe optical depth for a scattering and the averaged energy\nloss of electron (Eq. 11, see below).\nAs the density of soft photons dnph /dE /d\u03a9 we take the\nspectral density of blackbody radiation given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u01eb2 d\u01eb d\u03a9\ndnph\ndE d\u03a9 = 3\n(8)\ndE d\u03a9\n\u03bbC [exp(\u01eb/T ) \u2212 1]\nkT\nwhere T is a dimensionless temperature (T \u2261 mc\n2 ) and\n\u03bbC = h/(mc) is the electron Compton wavelength. Hereby\nwe neglect anisotropy of the thermal emission expected in\nthe strong magnetic field (eg Pavlov et al. 1994). For \u01eb \u226a\n\u01ebB a preferred photon propagation direction is that of the\nmagnetic field because the opacity is reduced for radiation\npolarized across B. The probability of collision with an\nelectron is greatly reduced for photons propagating at \u03bc \u2248\n1, thus, the efficiency of ICS as calculated below should\nbe treated as an upper limit.\nIf a scattering event occurs, we draw the energy \u01eb and\nthe cosine of polar angle \u03bc for an incoming photon from a\ndistribution determined with the integrand of Eq. (5). We\ndo this with the simple two-dimensional rejection method\nwhich is reliable though more time-consuming (cf. an approach by Daugherty & Harding 1989). Next, we transform \u01eb and \u03bc to the ERF values \u01eb\u2032 and \u03bc\u2032 , and sample the\ncosine of polar angle of an outgoing photon \u03bc\u2032s using the\ndifferential form of the cross section (6) in the Thomson\nlimit:\n\nh\nd\u03c3\n3\u03c3T\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n=\n\u03b4(\u01eb\n\u2212\n\u01eb\n)\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 )(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032s ) +\ns\nscat\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd\u01ebs d\u03a9s\n16\u03c0\n\u0015\n1\n\u20322\n\u20322\n+ (1 + \u03bc )(1 + \u03bcs )(g1 + g2 )\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\f4\n\nDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\n(eg.

As in the case of total cross\nsection (6), when \u01eb\u2032 > 2\u01ebB we replace the factor (g1 + g2 )\nin (9) with (2\u03c3KN /\u03c3T + g2 \u2212 g1 ). The sampled value of\n\u03bc\u2032s determines the energy \u01eb\u2032scat for the particular scattered\nphoton with the relativistic formula:\n\u0011 \u001a\n\u0010\n2 \u22121\n1 + \u01eb\u2032 (1 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 \u03bc\u2032s ) +\n\u01eb\u2032scat = 1 \u2212 \u03bc\u2032s\n\ni1/2 \u001b\nh\n2\n\u2212 1 + 2\u01eb\u2032 \u03bc\u2032s (\u03bc\u2032s \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 ) + \u01eb\u2032 (\u03bc\u2032s \u2212 \u03bc\u2032 )2\n\n(10)\n\nappropriate for collisions with a recoiled electron remaining at the ground Landau level (Herold 1979). Finally, a\nvalue of the electron's longitudinal momentum in the ERF\nis changed due to recoil from zero to (\u01eb\u2032 \u03bc\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032scat \u03bc\u2032s )mc,\nand transformed back to the OF.\nThe Monte Carlo method will be compared with a\nsmooth integration treatment of the magnetic ICS (Chang\n1995; Sturner 1995). In the integration method we assume\nthe same procedure to accelerate an electron and to subtract its energy losses due to the curvature radiation as\ndescribed above (Eq. 4). The only difference is in accounting for electron energy losses due to the magnetic inverse\nCompton scattering. These are estimated in each step (regardless the value of the optical depth for the scattering\nprocess) from the following formula for the mean electron\nenergy loss rate:\n\n\u2212\u03b3\u0307ICS = c\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ndnph\nd\u01eb d\u03a9\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc) \u00d7\nd\u01ebd\u03a9\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7 d\u01ebs d\u03a9s\n(\u01ebs \u2212 \u01eb)\nd\u01eb\u2032s d\u03a9\u2032s\nZ\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u01ebs = \u01eb\u2032s \u03b3(1 + \u03b2\u03bc\u2032s ) is the scattered photon energy\nin the OF (eg. Dermer 1990). In other words, the electron\nLorentz factor is determined as a solution of the differential equation:\nd\u03b3\n= v \u22121 (\u03b3\u0307acc + \u03b3\u0307ICS + \u03b3\u0307cr ).\ndh\n\n(12)\n\nAt each step, as an electron moves upwards, a decrease\nin both the dipolar magnetic field strength and the solid\nangle subtended by the thermal polar cap is taken into\naccount in both methods.\n3. Results\nWe compare the Monte Carlo method described in Sect. 2\nwith the integration method (numerical integration of\nEq. (12)), for a pulsar with the polar magnetic field\nstrength and rotation period as for B1509\u221258 (Bpc =\n15.8 \u00d7 1012 G, P = 0.15 s).\n\n3.1. The case of the M74 electric field\nIn this subsection the results are presented for the electric field of Michel (1974) (see Eq.1). The assumed values of Bpc and P give Ek = 3.67 \u00d7 106 V cm\u22121 and the\nstandard polar cap radius rpc = 3.74 \u00d7 104 cm. Following\nSturner (1995), we assumed the thermal polar cap radius\nRth = 105 cm (\u2243 2.7 \u00d7 rpc ) and hacc = rpc . Calculations have been performed for four different temperatures\nof the thermal polar cap: T6 = 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5, where\nT6 = T /(106K).\nEach panel in Fig. 1 presents in grey the curves \u03b3(h) as\ncalculated in the Monte Carlo way for one hundred individual electrons. The behaviour determined with Eq. (12)\nis overplotted as the thick solid line. The inclined dotted line presents changes of electron energy if there were\nno losses. It becomes horizontal at altitude hacc = rpc =\n3.74 \u00d7 104 cm above which the longitudinal component of\nelectric field Ek is assumed to be screened by a chargeseparated plasma distribution (see Eq. 1). This height is\ndenoted by the vertical long dashed line.\nThe thick solid trajectories \u03b3(h) in four panels of Fig. 1\nrepresent the \"averaged treatment\" solutions and are in\ngood agreement with the results of previous calculations\nby Sturner (1995) (cf his Fig. 4). Below h \u223c 10 cm\nthey overlap with the case with no energy losses (dotted), since the acceleration rate of electron (as given by\neE\n\u03b3\u0307acc = mck2 \u03b2c) significantly exceeds the energy loss rate\ndue to the ICS (see Fig. 2a). Energy losses due to the\nCR are negligible for any Lorentz factor accessible for an\nelectron, given the assumed acceleration model of Michel\n(Eq. 1). At larger altitudes the thick trajectories illustrate\nthe acceleration stopping effect noted by Chang (1995)\nand Kardash\u00ebv et al. (1984): the energy that the electrons\nwould have gained between altitudes h \u223c 102 and \u223c 104\ncm due to the electric field Ek is transferred to the thermal photons through the resonant inverse Compton scatterings. Depending on which process \u2013 either the resonant\nICS cooling or the acceleration \u2013 ceases first, the electrons end up with energy which is either closer to eEk hacc\n(ie. the energy acquired due to the full voltage drop at no\nradiative losses, the case T6 = 3.0) or decreases towards a\nfew tens \u00d7mc2 (the cases with T6 \u2265 3.5).\nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, the Monte Carlo tracks generally behave qualitatively in the same way: the increasing temperature of the thermal cap increases the altitude\nat which the acceleration takes over, and eventually, the\nLorentz factors of most of electrons become limited below\n102 . However, there are strong differences between the average energy of the Monte Carlo electrons and the value\nobtained with the integration method. They are especially\npronounced for T6 = 3.5, which is the case where a maximum altitude at which the acceleration can be counterbalanced by the electron energy losses due to the resonant ICS is equal to hacc . The bulk of the Monte Carlo\ntracks ends up with Lorentz factors \u03b3 > 105 , whereas the\n\n\fDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\n5\n\nFig. 1. Electron Lorentz factor as a\nfunction of altitude for the M74 electric field (Eq.1) above the surface of\na neutron star with B = 15.8 \u00d7 1012\nG, P = 0.15 s and Rth = 105 cm for\nfour temperatures of thermal polar\ncap: T6 = 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5. Each\npanel represents 100 curves calculated for individual electrons in the\nMonte Carlo way (grey). The mean\nbehaviour determined separately by\nsolving numerically the differential\nequation (12) is overplotted on them\nas the thick solid line. A strong disagreement between the two methods\nstands out for T6 = 3.5. The dotted\nline is for the case with no radiative\nlosses. The thick dashed line surrounds a region with |\u03b3\u0307ICS | > \u03b3\u0307acc .\nThe upper boundary of acceleration\nregion for model of Michel (1974) is\nmarked by the vertical dashed line.\nintegration-method solution gives \u03b3 \u2243 64. To understand\nthese differences it is worth investigating closely the behaviour of one exemplary electron as determined by the\ntwo methods.\nIn the integration method, the electron's energy increases monotonically until an equilibrium settles between\nthe energy loss process and the acceleration. Fig. 2b shows\n|\u03b3\u0307ICS | and \u03b3\u0307acc as a function of the Lorentz factor \u03b3 for\nthree different altitudes in the case T6 = 3.0. One can\nsee that |\u03b3\u0307ICS | exceeds \u03b3\u0307acc between the two equilibrium\nLorentz factors \u03b3eq1 and \u03b3eq2 the values of which are determined by the condition |\u03b3\u0307ICS | = \u03b3\u0307acc . We have calculated them using the approximation \u03b3\u0307ICS \u2243 \u03b3\u0307res where\n\u03b3\u0307res is the energy loss rate due to the resonant part of\nthe cross section alone (cf. Eq. (22) in Sturner 1995). The\ntwo equilibrium Lorentz factors \u03b3eq1 and \u03b3eq2 as calculated for different altitudes h are presented in Fig. 1 by\nthe thick dashed line. For increasing altitude their values approach each other because a decrease in the density of black-body photons moves down the whole curve\n|\u03b3\u0307ICS (\u03b3)| in Fig. 2b. Thus, the energy-altitude space is divided into two regimes: the region where |\u03b3\u0307ICS | > \u03b3\u0307acc ,\nhereafter called the \"energy loss dominated\" region, (it is\nsurrounded by the thick dashed line in Fig. 1), and the\n\n\"acceleration dominated\" region where |\u03b3\u0307ICS | < \u03b3\u0307acc . As\ncan be seen in Fig. 1, according to the integration method\nthe trajectory of an electron in the energy-altitude space\ndoes not penetrate the energy loss dominated region. As\nthe electron moves upwards, its Lorentz factor settles at\nthe lower equilibrium value \u03b3eq1 , and stays there as long\nas the equilibrium can exist ie. until the curves |\u03b3\u0307(\u03b3)| and\n\u03b3\u0307acc (\u03b3) in Fig. 2b disconnect. For T6 = 3.0 this happens\nnear the altitude heq = 2 \u00d7 104 . Above the height heq the\nacceleration cannot be counterballanced by the ICS energy\nlosses at any Lorentz factor accessible for the electron and\nthe increase in the electron energy resumes.\nIn the Monte Carlo method, the electron's energy\nlosses due to the scattering occur in a discontinuous way,\nthus, \u03b3 oscillates around the value \u03b3eq1 (see Fig. 3). When\nthe energy loss rate |\u03b3\u0307ICS | hardly exceeds the acceleration\nrate (see Fig. 2) the difference between the equilibrium\nLorentz factors (\u03b3eq1 \u2212 \u03b3eq2 ) is small and the electron is\nable to pass through the energy-loss dominated region.\nEg. for the case T6 = 3.0, \u03b3eq2 \u2243 2200 \u2243 4 \u00d7 \u03b3eq1 at\nh = 103 cm. To increase its energy from \u03b3eq1 to \u03b3eq2 it is\nenough for the electron to avoid a scattering over a 'break\u03b3eq2 \u2212\u03b3eq1\nthrough'-distance \u2206bt = eE\n2 = 228 cm which is only\nk /mc\n'a few' times larger than the local mean free path for scat-\n\n\f6\n\nDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\nFig. 2. Electron energy loss rate due to the ICS (thick\nsolid line) and the acceleration rate (thin solid) as a function of the electron Lorentz factor for the case T6 = 3.0: a\ncase h = 0 with contributions from angular, nonresonant,\nand resonant part of the cross section shown explicitly\n(dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed line, respectively); b decrease in the loss rate with increasing altitude. The curves\nare for h = 0, 104 , and 2 \u00d7 104 cm (from top to bottom).\nNote the narrowness of the Lorentz factor range within\nwhich |\u03b3\u0307ICS | exceeds \u03b3\u0307acc .\ntering \u03bbICS . The local value of \u03bbICS depends strongly on the\nelectron Lorentz factor and for \u03b3 between \u03b3eq1 and \u03b3eq2\nit ranges from 28 to 108 cm (the case T6 = 3.0, h = 103\ncm). This gives \u2206bt \u2243 (8 \u2212 2) \u00d7 \u03bbICS . Thus, there is a very\nlarge probability for the electron to gain \u03b3 >\n\u223c \u03b3eq2 at an\naltitude hMC lower than heq . Once the electron enters the\nacceleration dominated region at hMC \u226a heq , its energy\nstarts to increase up to a value much larger than obtained\nin the integration method.\nFor increasing temperatures T , the width (\u03b3eq2 \u2212 \u03b3eq1 )\nof the energy-loss dominated region increases (Fig. 1)\nwhereas the mean free path for \u03b3 = \u03b3eq1 decreases. This\nmakes the diffusion of electrons through the energy loss\ndominated region more difficult: to increase its energy\nfrom \u03b3eq1 to \u03b3eq2 an electron must avoid a scattering over a\n\nFig. 3.

As a result, the energy distribution for outgoing\nelectrons becomes softer (Fig. 4).\nIt should be emphasized that the strong disagreement\nbetween the final electron energies as determined with the\ntwo methods only appears if conditions similar to those\nfor the case T6 = 3.5 in Fig. 1 are fulfilled. These include\nthe equilibrium between the maximum rate of resonant\nenergy losses and the rate of acceleration at h = hacc .\nMaking use of Dermer's approximation for |\u03b3\u0307res | (Dermer\n1990) one can easily find that it has the maximum at\n2 1/2\n)\n\u03b3res = \u01ebB /(w(1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bcmin )T ) where \u03bcmin = h/(h2 + Rth\nis a cosine of an angle at which the thermal cap radius is\n\n\fDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\nFig. 4.

Both requirements partially stem from the dependence \u03bbICS (\u03b3res ) \u221d BT \u22123 which results in \u03bbICS \u226a \u2206bt\nfor high T and low Bpc . [Note that at the resonance \u03bbICS\nis proportional to B just as |\u03b3\u0307res |].\nAdditionally, high temperatures and low B-field\nstrengths preclude the diffusion because of relatively large\nenergy losses due to scatterings in the Klein-Nishina\nregime (see Fig 2a). First, for \u03b3 > \u03b3res , |\u03b3\u0307KN | \u226a \u03b3\u0307acc must\nhold, which requires low T .

It becomes efficient only at h >\n\u223c 0.9heq, thus, most\nMonte-Carlo electrons follow closely the behaviour predicted by the continuous approach by Chang (1995) or\nSturner (1995).\nFor other pulsars with a likely thermal X-ray emission from heated polar caps (eg. Geminga, B1055\u221252,\nand B0656+14) inferred temperatures are much lower (be-\n\n\f8\n\nDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\ntween 2 and 4 \u00d7106 K). Therefore, |\u03b3\u0307ICS | \u226a \u03b3\u0307acc for any\nLorentz factor accessible for an electron (Fig. 5) and the\nCompton scattering cannot considerably redistribute an\ninitial electron energy spectrum.\nBoth, in the case of negligible ICS losses, ie. for T \u226a\nT eq (h = 0), and in the cases when |\u03b3\u0307res (\u03b3res )| \u226b \u03b3\u0307acc holds\nup to h = hacc , ie. for T \u226b T eq (h = hacc ), we find the energy distribution of electrons to be quasi-monoenergetic\nwith energy well approximated by Eq.12. In the case of\nnegligible ICS cooling the energy distribution of electrons\nis a narrow peak at the energy \u03b3max mc2 = eEk hacc ,\nwhereas for very large efficiency of ICS losses (close to\n100% of \u03b3max mc2 ) nearly all particles are cooled down\nto the energy \u03b3min for which the ICS loss rate decreases\nsharply (see Fig. 2a and Fig. 1). Between these limiting\ncases, ie. when the ICS cooling is comparable to the acceleration, broad energy distributions of electrons (ranging\nfrom \u03b3min to \u03b3max ) emerge (Fig. 4).\n3.2. The case of the HM98 electric field\nTo enable electron energy losses due to the resonant ICS\nto compete with acceleration (the resonant ICS damping\nbecomes then important and the diffusion effect does occur) the strength of the electric field Ek should not exceed a critical value which may be roughly estimated as\nEkeq \u2243 3 * 104 B12 T62 V cm\u22121 (cf. Chang 1995). For Ek (h)\ngiven by eq. (18) of HM98 this may only occur in the case\nof small acceleration length hacc \u226a rpc (see Eq. (2)), when\nthe acceleration height is limited by the ICS-induced pair\nformation front. Self consistent values of hacc are then of\nthe order of a few\u00d7103 cm, i.e. much smaller than for a\nCR-induced case (cf. figs. 5 and 6 in HM98). A value of\nhacc is considered self consistent if the acceleration of primary electrons by the electric field induced with this hacc\ngenerates pair formation front at hacc .\nWe calculated self consistent hacc in an approximate\nway, following HM98, by finding a minimum of a sum of\nacceleration length and a mean free path for one photon\nabsorption:\nhacc = min\n\n(\u0012\n\n2\u03b3\nN\n\n\u00131/2\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\n0.2\u03c1curv\n\u01ebB \u01eb\n\n\u0013)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere to get the first term we used Ek in the limit\nh \u226a hacc , given by Eq. (2): Ek (h) = N h with N =\n2 \u22121\n3\u03a9Rns Bpc \u03ba cos \u03c7(c(1 \u2212 \u01ebGR )Rns\n) hacc . As an energy of\npair producing photons in the second term we assumed\nthat for the resonant scattering: \u01eb \u223c \u03b3\u01ebB . In Eq. (15)\nwe neglected a contribution from the mean free path\nfor the resonant ICS which is of the order of 150(1 \u2212\n\u03b2\u03bcmin )\u22121 B12 T6\u22123 cm near the resonance. Since in the\nregime hacc \u226a rpc the electric field Ek depends itself on\nhacc we had to repeat the calculation of hacc starting from\nsome guess value until convergence. For Bpc = 15.8 TG,\n\nP = 0.15 s, \u03c1curv = 107 cm and \u03c7 = 0.1 rad we obtained\nhacc \u2243 2 \u00d7 103 cm.\nThen we calculated the changes of \u03b3 with h for Rth =\n105 cm and for different thermal cap temperatures (as\nlisted in the preceding subsection). We found that the\nmost notable divergence between the Monte Carlo results\nand the integration method results occurs for T6 = 3.5. As\ncan be seen in Fig. 6a, at h \u2243 103 cm most Monte Carlo\nelectrons reach Lorentz factor values between 103 and 104 ,\ncontrary to 470 as predicted by the integration method.\nThe difference disappears only above the accelerator (i.e.\nfor h > hacc ) because such altitude is still low enough (i.e.\nh \u226a Rth ) for the resonant ICS to damp \u03b3 to its final value\nof about \u223c 50 (at which it becomes eventually negligible).\nAn effect similar to that shown in Fig. 1 appears, however, when the resonant ICS losses are no longer effective\nabove h = hacc . Fig. 6b shows the case with Rth = 4.0\u00d7103\ncm = 2 \u00d7 hacc and T6 = 3.0. Broad electron energy distribution (with average energy much exceeding a value from\nthe integration method) emerges.\nSimilarly as in the weak electric field case, the position\nof the diffusion region in T -Bpc plane (for a fixed value of\nRth ) is here determined with a condition analogous to Eq.\n(13) (but Ek of Eq.(2) requires a more accurate determination of hacc ) along with a requirement for strong Bpc\nand low T .\nFor stronger electric fields (Ek > Ekeq ), or for larger\nacceleration lengths the resonant ICS has negligible influence on final electron energies. In the first case acceleration greatly dominates the ICS damping; in the second\ncase acceleration is stopped only over a negligible, initial\npart of accelerator height.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have calculated the efficiency of energy losses for electrons accelerated over a hot polar cap of a neutron star. As\ncooling mechanisms we have considered the inverse Compton scattering and the curvature radiation, (though the\nlatter has been negligible for the considered acceleration\nmodels).\nThe electron energy losses due to the ICS have been\ncalculated with the Monte Carlo method and compared\nwith the integration method (after Chang 1995; Sturner\n1995) based on the prescription for the averaged ICS\ncooling (Dermer 1990). We confirm general predictions\nof the integration approach (eg. the limitation of electron\nLorentz factors below \u223c 102 for high temperatures), nevertheless, the \"stopping acceleration effect\" occurs at a\nslightly higher temperature than that one resulting from\nintegrating the differential equation (12).\nFor the considered pulsar parameters (Bpc = 15.8 \u00d7\n1012 G, Rth = 105 cm) and the acceleration potential by\nMichel (1974), the Monte Carlo-based value is approximately equal to TMC = 4.5 \u00d7 106 K (at this T only a\nfew percent of electrons reach \u03b3 > 102 at h = 106 cm)\n\n\fDyks & Rudak: Electron energy losses near polar caps\n\n9\n\ntemperatures lie within the similar range (2 \u2212 4) \u00d7 106 K\n(\u00d6gelman 1995).\nWe find that for high-B and low-T pulsars the integration method gives a poor estimation of electron Lorentz\nfactors if the energy loss rate due to the resonant ICS\nhardly exceeds the rate of acceleration. In the case of\nMichel's model and for Rth > hacc , this occurs if T \u223c\n4(B12 P )\u22121/4 which may be the case for PSR B1509\u221258.\nIn the cases when the ICS loss rate dominate firmly over\nthe acceleration or is negligible the energy distribution\nof outgoing electrons is quasi-monoenergetic around the\nvalue which is well approximated with the continuous approach.\nWe find that preventing electrons from achieving large\nLorentz factors occurs also for accelerating potential by\nHarding & Muslimov (1998) in its nonsaturated version\nwith hacc \u226a rpc . The discrepancy between the Monte\nCarlo and the integration method also occurs within the\nhigh-B and low-T regime and is especially pronounced for\nRth \u223c hacc .\nAcknowledgements.
