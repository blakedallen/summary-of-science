It then discusses the prospects\nof a relatively light H \u00b1 boson search via top quark decay and finally a heavy H \u00b1\nboson search at LHC. The viable channels for H \u00b1 search are discussed, with particular\nemphasis on the H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decay channel.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) contains two Higgs\n0,\u2212\ndoublets \u03c6+,0\nu and \u03c6d , with opposite hypercharge Y = \u00b11, to give masses to the up and down\ntype quarks and leptons. This also ensures anomaly cancellation between their fermionic\npartners. The two doublets of complex scalars correspond to 8 degrees of freedom, 3 of\nwhich are absorbed as Goldstone bosons to give mass and longitudinal components to the\nW \u00b1 and Z bosons. This leaves 5 physical states: two neutral scalars h0 and H 0 , a pseudoscalar A0 , and a pair of charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 . While it may be hard to distinguish any\none of these neutral Higgs bosons from that of the Standard Model, the H \u00b1 pair carry a\ndistinctive hall-mark of the MSSM. Hence the charged Higgs boson plays a very important\nrole in the search of the SUSY Higgs sector.\nAt the tree-level all the MSSM Higgs masses and couplings are given in terms of two\nparameters \u2013 the ratio of the vacuum expectation values, tan \u03b2 = h\u03c60u i/h\u03c60di, and any one\nof the masses, usually taken to be MA . The physical H \u00b1 and A0 states correspond to the\ncombinations\n\u00b1\nH \u00b1 = \u03c6\u00b1\nu cos \u03b2 + \u03c6d sin \u03b2,\n1\n\nPlenary talk PASCOS05, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, June 2005\n\n\fA0 =\n\n\u221a\n\n2(Im\u03c60u cos \u03b2 + Im\u03c60d sin \u03b2),\n\n(1)\n\nwhile their masses are related by\n2\n,\nMH2 \u00b1 = MA2 + MW\n\nwith negligible radiative corrections [1].\nThe important couplings of the charged Higgs boson are\ng\ng\nH + t\u0304b : \u221a\n(mt cot \u03b2 + mb tan \u03b2), H + \u03c4 \u03bd : \u221a\nm\u03c4 tan \u03b2,\n2MW\n2MW\ng\n(mc cot \u03b2 + ms tan \u03b2), H + W \u2212 Z : 0,\nH + c\u0304s : \u221a\n2MW\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwith negligible radiative corrections.\nThe H + t\u0304b Yukawa coupling of eq.(3) is ultraviolet divergent. Assuming it to remain\nperturbative upto the GUT scale implies\n1 < tan \u03b2 < mt /mb (\u223c 50).\n\n(4)\n\nHowever this assumes the absence of any new physics beyond the MSSM upto the GUT scale\n\u2013 i.e. the socalled desert scenario. Without this assumption one gets weaker limits from the\nperturbative bounds on this coupling at the electroweak scale, i.e.\n0.3 < tan \u03b2 < 200.\n\n(5)\n\nMoreover there is a strong constraint on the MA \u2212 tan \u03b2 parameter space coming from the\nLEP-2 bound on the HSM mass, which is also applicable to Mh at low tan \u03b2, i.e. Mh > 114\nGeV [2]. Comparing this with the MSSM prediction implies tan \u03b2 > 2.4 for any value of\nMA [1, 2] (see Fig. 2 below). However the MSSM prediction for Mh depends sensitively\non the top quark mass. The reported increase of this mass from 175 to 178 \u00b1 4.3 GeV\n[3] along with a more exact evaluation of the radiative correction [4] lead to a significant\nweaking of this constraint. In fact there will be no LEP bound on tan \u03b2 in this case, which\nis valid for all values of MA . Nonetheless it implies MA > 150 GeV (MH \u00b1 > 170 GeV)\nover the low tan \u03b2(\u2264 2) region. But being an indirect bound, it depends strongly on the\nunderlying model. There is no such bound in the CP violating MSSM due to h-A mixing [5].\nMoreover there are singlet extensions of the MSSM Higgs sector like the socalled NMSSM,\nwhich invalidate these MA (MH \u00b1 ) bounds without disturbing the charged Higgs boson [6].\nTherefore it is prudent to relax these indirect constraints on MH \u00b1 and tan \u03b2, and search for\nH \u00b1 over the widest possible parameter space. It should be noted here that the H \u00b1 couplings\nof eq.(3) continue to hold over a wide class of models. In fact the fermionic couplings hold\nfor the general class of Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models, where one doublet couples to up\ntype and the other to down type quarks and leptons [1].\n\n2\n\nSearch for a Light H \u00b1 (MH \u00b1 < mt)\n\nThe main production mechanism in this case is top quark pair production\nq q\u0304, gg \u2192 tt\u0304,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\ffollowed by\nt \u2192 bH + and/or t\u0304 \u2192 b\u0304H \u2212 .\n\n(7)\n\nH + \u2192 cs\u0304, \u03c4 + \u03bd and W bb\u0304 + hc,\n\n(8)\n\nThe dominant decay channels of H \u00b1 are\n\nwhere the 3-body final state comes via the virtual tb\u0304 channel. All these decay widths are\neasily calculated from the Yukawa couplings of eq.(3). The QCD correction can be simply\nimplemented in the leading log approximation by substituting the quark masses appearing\nin the Yukawa couplings by their running masses at the H \u00b1 mass scale [7]. Its main effect is\nto reduce the b and c pole masses of 4.6 and 1.8 GeV respectively [2] to their running masses\nmb (MH \u00b1 ) \u2243 2.8 GeV and mc (MH \u00b1 ) \u2243 1 GeV. The corresponding reduction in the t pole\nmass of 175 GeV is only \u223c 5 %.\n< 1 and tan \u03b2 > m /m , which are driven\nThe t \u2192 bH + branching ratio is large at tan \u03b2 \u223c\n\u223c t b\n+\nby the mt and the mb terms of the H t\u0304bqcoupling of eq. (3) respectively. However it has\na pronounced minimum around tan \u03b2 = mt /mb \u2243 7.5, where the SM decay of t \u2192 bW\nis dominant. The H \u00b1 is expected to decay dominantly into the \u03c4 \u03bd channel for tan \u03b2 > 1,\nwhile the cs and the bb\u0304W channels dominate in the tan \u03b2 \u2264 1 region. This can be easily\nunderstood in terms of the respective couplings of eq.(3). The H + \u2192 b\u0304bW three-body decay\n> 140 GeV, although the\nvia virtual tb\u0304 channel is larger than the H + \u2192 cs\u0304 decay for MH \u00b1 \u223c\n+\nformer is a higher order process [8, 9]. This is because the H t\u0304b coupling is larger than the\nH + c\u0304s coupling by a factor of mt /mc > 100 in the low tan \u03b2 region. The MH \u00b1 < 140 GeV\nregion has already been excluded at tan \u03b2 \u2264 1 by the t \u2192 bH + \u2192 bcs\u0304 search at Tevatron [2].\nWith a much larger tt\u0304 production rate at LHC one can extend the search to the MH \u00b1 > 140\nGeV region via the H \u00b1 \u2192 bb\u0304W channel at tan \u03b2 \u2264 1 [9]. Let us concentrate however on the\nH \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd channel, which dominates the theoretically favoured region of tan \u03b2 > 1.\n\n2.1\n\n\u03c4 Polarization Effect\n\nThe discovery reach of the \u03c4 channel for H \u00b1 search at Tevatron and LHC can be significantly\nenhanced by exploiting the opposite polarization of \u03c4 coming from the H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd(P\u03c4 =\n+1) and W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd(P\u03c4 = \u22121) decays [10]. Let me briefly describe this simple but very\npowerful method. The best channel for \u03c4 -detection in terms of efficiency and purity is its\n1-prong hadronic decay channel, which accounts for 50% of its total decay width. The main\ncontributors to this channel are\n\u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd\u03c4 (12.5%), \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c1\u00b1 \u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03c4 (26%),\n\u00b1 0 0\n\u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 a\u00b1\n1 \u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03bd\u03c4 (7.5%),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the branching fractions of the \u03c0 and \u03c1 channels include the small K and K \u2217 contributions respectively [2], which have identical polarization effects. Together they account for\nmore than 90% of the 1-prong hadronic decay of \u03c4 . The CM angular distributions of \u03c4 decay\ninto \u03c0 or a vector meson v(= \u03c1, a1 ) is simply given in terms of its polarization as\n1\n1 d\u0393\u03c0\n=\n(1 + P\u03c4 cos \u03b8),\n\u0393\u03c0 d cos \u03b8\n2\n3\n\n\f1 2\nm\n1 d\u0393vL\n2 \u03c4\n(1 + P\u03c4 cos \u03b8),\n=\n2\n\u0393v d cos \u03b8\nm\u03c4 + 2m2v\n\n1 d\u0393vT\nm2v\n(1 \u2212 P\u03c4 cos \u03b8),\n=\n\u0393v d cos \u03b8\nm2\u03c4 + 2m2v\n\n(10)\n\nwhere L, T denote the longitudinal and transverse polarization states of the vector meson\n[10, 11]. This angle is related to the fraction x of the \u03c4 lab. momentum carried by the\nmeson, i.e. the (visible) \u03c4 -jet momentum, via\ncos \u03b8 =\n\n2x \u2212 1 \u2212 m2\u03c0,v /m2\u03c4\n.\n1 \u2212 m2\u03c0,v /m2\u03c4\n\n(11)\n\nIt is clear from (10) and (11) that the signal (P\u03c4 = +1) has a harder \u03c4 -jet than the background (P\u03c4 = \u22121) for the \u03c0 and the \u03c1L , a1L contributions; but it is the opposite for \u03c1T , a1T\ncontributions. Now, it is possible to suppress the transverse \u03c1 and a1 contributions and\nenhance the hardness of the signal \u03c4 -jet relative to the background even without identifying\nthe individual resonance contributions to this channel. This is because the transverse \u03c1 and\na1 decays favour even sharing of momentum among the decay pions, while the longitudinal \u03c1\nand a1 decays favour uneven distributions, where the charged pion carries either very little or\nmost of the momentum [10, 11]. Fig. 1 shows the decay distributions of \u03c1L , a1L and \u03c1T , a1T\nin the momentum fraction carried by the charged pion, i.e.\nx\u2032 = p\u03c0\u00b1 /p\u03c4 \u2212jet .\n\n(12)\n\nThe distributions are clearly peaked near x\u2032 \u2243 0 and x\u2032 \u2243 1 for the longitudinal \u03c1 and a1 ,\nwhile they are peaked in the middle for the transverse ones. Note that the \u03c4 + \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd\u03c4 decay\nwould appear as a \u03b4 function at x\u2032 = 1 on this plot. Thus requiring the \u03c0 \u00b1 to carry > 80%\nof the \u03c4 -jet momentum,\nx\u2032 > 0.8,\n(13)\nretains about half the longitudinal \u03c1 along with the pion but very little of the transverse\ncontributions. This cut suppresses not only the W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd background but also the fake \u03c4\nbackground from QCD jets2 . Consequently the \u03c4 -channel can be used for H \u00b1 search over a\nwider range of parameters. The resulting H \u00b1 discovery reach of LHC is shown on the left\nside of Fig.2 [12]. It goes upto MA \u2243 100 GeV (MH \u00b1 \u2243 130 GeV) around the dip region of\ntan \u03b2 \u2243 7.5 and upto MA \u2243 140 GeV (MH \u00b1 \u2243 160 GeV) outside this region.\n\nSearch for a Heavy H \u00b1 (MH \u00b1 > mt)\n\n3\n\nThe main production process here is the leading order (LO) process [13]\ngb \u2192 tH \u2212 + h.c.\n\n(14)\n\nThe complete NLO QCD corrections have been recently calculated by two groups [14, 15],\nin agreement with one another. Their main results are summarized below:\nNote that the x\u2032 \u2243 0 peak from \u03c1L and a1L can not be used in practice, since \u03c4 -identification requires a\nhard \u03c0 \u00b1 , which will not be swept away from the accompanying neutrals by the magnetic field.\n2\n\n4\n\n\f(i) The effect of NLO corrections can be incorporated by multiplying the above LO crosssection by a K factor, with practically no change in its kinematic distributions.\n(ii) With the usual choice of renormalization and factorization scales, \u03bcR = \u03bcF = MH \u00b1 +\nmt , one gets K \u2243 1.5 over the large MH \u00b1 and tan \u03b2 range of interest.\n(iii) The overall NLO correction of 50% comes from two main sources - (a) \u223c 80% correction from gluon emission and virtual gluon exchange contributions to the LO process\n(14), and (b) \u223c \u2212 30% correction from the NLO process\ngg \u2192 tH \u2212 b + h.c.,\n\n(15)\n\nafter subtracting the overlapping piece from (14) to avoid double counting.\n(iv) As clearly shown in [15], the negative correction from (b) is an artifact of the common\nchoice of factorization and renormalization scales. With a more appropriate choice\nof the factorization scale, \u03bcF \u2243 (MH \u00b1 + mt )/5, the correction from (b) practically\nvanishes while that from (a) reduces to \u223c 60%. Note however that the overall K factor\nis insensitive to this scale variation.\n(v) Hence for simplicity one can keep a common scale of \u03bcF,R = MH \u00b1 + mt along with a\nK factor of 1.5, with an estimated uncertainty of 20%. Note that for the process (14)\nthe running quark masses of the H + t\u0304b coupling (3) are to be evaluated at \u03bcR , while\nthe patron densities are evaluated at \u03bcF .\nThe dominant decay mode for a heavy H \u00b1 is into the tb channel. The H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd is the\n> 10), while the H \u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 h0 can be the largest\nlargest subdominant channel at large tan \u03b2( \u223c\nsubdominant channel over a part of the small tan \u03b2 region [1]. Let us look at the prospects\nof a heavy H \u00b1 search at LHC in each of these channels. The dominant background in each\ncase comes from the tt\u0304 production process (6).\n\n3.1\n\nHeavy H \u00b1 Search in the \u03c4 \u03bd Channel\n\nThis constitutes the most important channel for a heavy H \u00b1 search at LHC in the large\n> 10 and M \u00b1 > 300 GeV, we have\ntan \u03b2 region. Over a large part of this region, tan \u03b2 \u223c\nH \u223c\nBR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) = 20 \u00b1 5%.\n\n(16)\n\nThe H \u00b1 signal coming from (14) and (16) is distinguished by very hard \u03c4 -jet and missingpT (p\n/T ),\npT\u03c4\u2212jet > 100GeV and /pT > 100GeV,\n(17)\nwith hadronic decay of the accompanying top quark (t \u2192 bq q\u0304) [16]. The main background\ncomes from the tt\u0304 production process (6), followed by t \u2192 b\u03c4 \u03bd, while the other t decays\nhadronically. This has however a much softer \u03c4 -jet and can be suppressed significantly with\nthe cut (17). Moreover the opposite \u03c4 polarizations for the signal and background can be\nused to suppress the background further, as discussed earlier. Figure 3 shows the signal\nand background cross-sections against the fractional \u03c4 -jet momentum carried by the charged\n5\n\n\fpion (12). The hard charged pion cut of (13) suppresses the background by a factor of\n5-6 while retaining almost half the signal cross-section. Moreover the signal \u03c4 -jet has a\nconsiderably harder pT and larger azimuthal opening angle with the /pT in comparison with\nthe background. Consequently the signal has a much broader distribution in the transverse\nmass of the \u03c4 -jet with the /pT , extending upto MH \u00b1 , while the background goes only upto\nMW . Figure 4 shows these distributions both with and without the hard charged pion cut\n(13). One can effectively separate the H \u00b1 signal from the background and estimate the H \u00b1\nmass from this distribution. The LHC discovery reach of this channel is shown in Fig. 2,\nwhich clearly shows it to be the best channel for a heavy H \u00b1 search at large tan \u03b2. It should\nbe added here that the transition region between MH \u00b1 > mt and < mt has been recently\nanalysed in [17] by combining the production process of (14) with (6,7). As a result it has\nbeen possible to bridge the gap between the two discovery contours of Fig. 2 via the \u03c4 \u03bd\nchannel.\n\n3.2\n\nHeavy H \u00b1 Search in the tb Channel\n\nLet us discuss this first for 3 and then 4 b-tags. In the first case the signal comes from (14),\nfollowed by\nH \u00b1 \u2192 tb\u0304, t\u0304b.\n(18)\nThe background comes from the NLO QCD processes\ngg \u2192 tt\u0304bb\u0304, gb \u2192 tt\u0304b + h.c., gg \u2192 tt\u0304g,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the gluon jet in the last case can be mistagged as b (with a typical probability of\n\u223c 1%). One requires leptonic decay of one of the tt\u0304 pair and hadronic decay of the other\nwith a pT > 30 GeV cut on all the jets [18]. For this cut the b-tagging efficiency at LHC is\nexpected to be \u223c 50%. After reconstruction of both the top masses, the remaining (3rd) b\nquark jet is expected to be hard for the signal (14,18), but soft for the background processes\n(19). A pT > 80 GeV cut on this b-jet improves the signal/background ratio. Finally this\nb-jet is combined with each of the reconstructed top pair to give two entries of Mtb per event.\nFor the signal events, one of them corresponds to the H \u00b1 mass while the other constitutes\na combinatorial background. Figure 5 shows this invariant mass distribution for the signal\nalong with the above mentioned background processes for different H \u00b1 masses at tan \u03b2 = 40\nSimilar\ncan check that the significance level of the signal is\n\u221a results hold for tan \u03b2 \u2243 1.5. One\n> 5 [18]. The corresponding H \u00b1 discovery reaches in the high and low tan \u03b2 regions\nS/ B \u223c\nare shown in Fig. 2. While the discovery reach via tb is weaker than that via the \u03c4 \u03bd channel\nin the high tan \u03b2 region, the former offers the best H \u00b1 discovery reach in the low tan \u03b2 region.\nThis is particularly important in view of the fact that the indirect LEP limit shown in Fig.\n2 gets significantly weaker with the reported increase in the top quark mass, as discussed\nearlier.\nOne can also use 4 b-tags to look for the H \u00b1 \u2192 tb signal [19]. The signal comes from\n(15,18), and the background from the first process of (19). After the reconstruction of the tt\u0304\npair, both the remaining pair of b-jets are expected to be soft for the background, since they\ncome from gluon splitting. For the signal, however, one of them comes from the H \u00b1 decay\n(18); and hence expected to be hard and uncorrelated with the other b-jet. Thus requiring a\n6\n\n\fpT > 120 GeV cut on the harder of the two b-jets along with large invariant mass (Mbb > 120\nGeV) and opening angle (cos\u03b8bb < 0.75) for the pair, one can enhance the signal/background\nratio substantially. Unfortunately the requirement of 4 b-tags makes the signal size very\nsmall. Moreover the signal contains one soft b-jet from (15), for which one has to reduce\nthe pT threshold from 30 to 20 GeV. The resulting signal and background cross-sections\nare shown in Fig. 6 for tan \u03b2 = 40. In comparison with Fig. 5 one can see a significant\nenhancement in the signal/background ratio, but at the cost of a much smaller signal size.\nNonetheless this can be used as a supplementary channel for H \u00b1 search, provided one can\nachieve good b-tagging for pT \u223c 20 GeV jets.\n\n3.3\n\nHeavy H \u00b1 Search in the W h0 Channel\n\n> 100 GeV in the MSSM implies that the H \u00b1 \u2192 W h0 decay channel\nThe LEP limit of Mh0 \u223c\nhas at least as high a threshold as the tb channel. The maximum value of its decay BR,\n\nB max (H \u00b1 \u2192 W h0 ) \u2243 5%,\n\n(20)\n\nis reached for H \u00b1 mass near this threshold and low tan \u03b2. The small BR for this decay\nchannel is due the suppression of the H + W \u2212 h0 coupling relative to the H + t\u0304b coupling (3).\nNote that both the decay channels correspond the same final state, H \u00b1 \u2192 bb\u0304W , along with\nan accompanying top from the production process (14). Nonetheless one can distinguish the\nH \u00b1 \u2192 W h0 from the H \u00b1 \u2192 tb as well as the corresponding backgrounds (19) by looking for\na clustering of the bb\u0304 invariant mass around Mh0 along with a veto on the second top [20].\nUnfortunately the BR of (20) is too small to give a viable signal for this decay channel. Note\n> 100 GeV does not hold in the CP violating MSSM\nhowever that the LEP limit of Mh0 \u223c\n[5] or the singlet extensions of the MSSM Higgs sector like the NMSSM [6]. Therefore it is\npossible to have a W h0 threshold significantly below mt in these model. Consequently one\ncan have a H \u00b1 boson lighter than the top quark in these models in the low tan \u03b2 region,\nwhich can dominantly decay into the W h0 channel. Thus it is possible to have spectacular\nt \u2192 bH + \u2192 bW h0 decay signals at LHC in the NMSSM [20] as well as the CP violating\nMSSM [21].\n\n4\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nLet me conclude by commenting on a few aspects of H \u00b1 boson search, which could not be\ndiscussed in this brief review. The associated production of H \u00b1 with W boson has been\ninvestigated in [22], and the H \u00b1 H \u2213 and H \u00b1 A0 productions in [23]. Being second order\nelectroweak processes, however, they give much smaller signals than (14), while suffering\nfrom the same background. However one can get potentially large H \u00b1 signal from the decay\nof strongly produced squarks and gluinos at LHC, which can help to fill in the gap in the\nintermediate tan \u03b2 region of Fig. 2 for favourable SUSY parameters [24].\nFinally, the SUSY quantum correction to H \u00b1 production can be potentially important\nsince it is known to be nondecoupling, i.e. it remains finite even for very large SUSY mass\nparameters [25, 26, 27]. A brief discussion of this effect can be found in a larger version of\nthis review [28], which also covers H \u00b1 search at LEP and Tevatron.\n7\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For a recent review see M.
