Attempts to unravel the\nbaryon structure have led to an impressive determination of the properties of the nucleon, e.g. polarizabilities,\nmagnetic moments, and more general form factors. Additional and substantial insight in the parton structure\nof the nucleon has been gained through deep inelastic\nelectron scattering. In contrast to that, the knowledge\nof the nucleon's excited states is limited to the mass of\nthe lowest resonances and its (iso)spin quantum numbers.\nHowever, to test the modelling of internal degrees of freedom of the excited states, measurements of static properties are required. In particular, the properties of the\n\u2206(1232) resonance are of considerable interest because of\nits prominent position in the excitation spectrum.\nIn this context, the magnetic moment is an important observable for testing theoretical baryon structure\ncalculations. Different predictions for the magnetic moment were made in several calculations [1, 2, 3, 4]. The\nmagnetic moments of the octet of baryons (N, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e)\nof the SU(3) flavor symmetry classification are known\nvery accurately through spin precession measurements.\nHowever, for the decuplet baryons, only the \u03a9\u2212 magnetic moment has been determined as the lifetime of the\nother decuplet members is too short for this technique.\nIf SU(3) flavour symmetry were to hold, the \u2206 and the\nnucleon would be degenerate in mass and their magnetic\nmoments related through \u03bc\u2206 = Q\u2206 \u03bcp , where Q\u2206 is the\n\u2206 charge and \u03bcp the proton magnetic moment. However,\nstructure calculations predict significant deviations from\nthis SU(3) value [1, 2, 3, 4].\nIt has been proposed that the electromagnetic structure of the \u2206 can be determined by measuring a \u03b3transition within the resonance [5]. This method is depicted in Fig. 1, which shows an energy level diagram\nwith the proton (nucleon) as the ground state and the \u2206\nas the first excited state. The \u2206 structure can be probed\nby exciting the proton to a \u2206, which then emits a real\nphoton and subsequently decays into a nucleon and a\n\nE / MeV\n\ng \u0301\n1232\n\ng\n938\n\np\u00b0\nproton\n\nFIG. 1: Method to study the static electromagnetic properties of the \u2206+ (1232) isobar. The \u03b3 \u2032 transition carries the\ninformation of the magnetic moment of the \u2206+ .\n\npion. Spin and parity conservation require that the lowest order electromagnetic transition is magnetic dipole\n(M1) radiation. This \u2206 \u2192 \u2206\u03b3 \u2032 amplitude is proportional\nto \u03bc\u2206+ and was recently investigated in theoretical calculations [6, 7, 8]. The next allowed multipole is the\nelectric quadrupole (E2) transition, but this amplitude\nvanishes in the limit of zero photon energy because of\ntime reversal symmetry [9]. The E2/M1 ratio of the transition amplitude N \u2192 \u2206 has been measured to be very\nsmall, approx 0.025 [10], which leads to the assumption\nthat the quadrupole deformation of the \u2206 is very small.\nThe magnetic octupole (M3) transition is suppressed by\ntwo additional powers of photon momentum. Hence, the\nmeasurement of the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p provides access\nto \u03bc\u2206+ . Unfortunately this final state can also result\nfrom bremsstrahlung radiation of the intermediate \u2206 and\nthe proton. These contributions are of the same order as\nthe \u2206 \u2192 \u2206\u03b3 \u2032 transition of interest. Nonresonant contributions are expected to play a minor role, since the\npartial wave decomposition of the related elastic channel\n\u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 p shows the dominance of the \u2206 resonant reaction process [11]. The reaction channel \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b3 \u2032 n is\nin that sense less favorable for extracting the magnetic\n\n\f35\n\n2\n\n375<E\u03b3<425MeV\n\ncounts / 0.001 GeV\n\ncounts / 0.001 GeV\n\nmoment of the \u2206+ isobar. An accurate theoretical description of all processes contributing to \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p is\ncrucial for extracting a precise value for \u03bc\u2206+ .\nThe magnetic moment of the \u2206++ isobar was extracted\nin a similar way from the reaction \u03c0 + p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b3 \u2032 p. Two\nexperiments at the University of California (UCLA) [12]\nand the Schweizerisches Institut f\u00fcr Nuklearforschung\n(SIN, now called PSI) [13] have been performed and\nas a result of many theoretical analyses of these data\nthe Particle Data Group [14] quotes a range of \u03bc\u2206++ =\n3.7\u20137.5 \u03bcN (where \u03bcN is the nuclear magneton). The\nlarge uncertainty in the extraction of \u03bc\u2206++ is due to the\nstrong contribution of \u03c0 + bremsstrahlung and model dependencies. In the reaction channel described here, the\nbremsstrahlung contributions are much weaker.\nThe reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p was measured at the electron accelerator Mainz Microtron (MAMI) [15, 16] using\nthe Glasgow tagged photon facility [17, 18] and the photon spectrometer TAPS [19, 20]. A quasi-monochromatic\nphoton beam was produced via bremsstrahlung tagging.\nThe photon energy covered the range 205\u2013820 MeV with\nan average energy resolution of 2 MeV. The TAPS detector consisted of six blocks each with 62 hexagonally\nshaped BaF2 crystals arranged in an 8\u00d78 matrix and a\nforward wall with 138 BaF2 crystals arranged in a 11\u00d714\nrectangle. Each crystal is 250 mm long with an inner diameter of 59 mm. The six blocks were located in a horizontal plane around the target at angles of \u00b154\u25e6 , \u00b1103\u25e6\nand \u00b1153\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis. Their distance\nto the target was 55 cm and the distance of the forward\nwall was 60 cm. This setup covered \u224840% of the full solid\nangle. All BaF2 modules were equipped with 5 mm thick\nplastic detectors for the identification of charged particles. The liquid hydrogen target was 10 cm long with a\ndiameter of 3 cm. Further details are described in [21].\nThe measurement of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p reaction channel was exclusive since the 4-momenta of all particles in\nthe final state were determined. The \u03c0 \u25e6 mesons were detected via their two photon decay channel and identified\nin a standard invariant mass analysis from the measured\nphoton momenta. The two \u03c0 \u25e6 decay photons and the\n\u03b3 \u2032 photon in the final state were distinguished by using\nthe \u03c0 \u25e6 invariant mass as a selection criterion. The two\nphotons with an invariant mass closest to the \u03c0 \u25e6 mass\nwere assigned to be the decay photons. The protons were\nidentified using the excellent time resolution of the TAPS\ndetector and the deposited proton energy: The characteristic time of flight dependence on the energy of the\nproton and a pulse shape analysis [21] were sufficient to\nidentify the proton uniquely. The proton energy calibration was performed by exploiting energy balance of the\nexclusively measured \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 p channel, thereby compensating for the energy loss in the target and plastic\ndetectors. Random TAPS - tagging spectrometer coincidences were subtracted using background events outside\nthe prompt coincidence time window.\nFurther kinematic checks were performed by exploiting\nthe kinematic overdetermination of the reaction.

After that, a missing\nmass analysis was performed to discriminate the 2\u03c0 \u25e6 contamination. The following missing mass was calculated:\n2\nMX\n=\n\n((E\u03c0\u25e6 + Ep ) \u2212 (Ebeam + mp ))2\n\npbeam ))2\n\u2212((~\np\u03c0\u25e6 + p~p ) \u2212 (~\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E\u03c0\u25e6 , p~\u03c0\u25e6 , Ep , p~p denote the energy and momenta\nof the \u03c0 \u25e6 and proton in the final state and mp the proton mass. The resulting distributions (Fig. 2) show two\ndistinct peaks, the widths of which are determined by\nthe detector resolution. The peak near 0.02 GeV2 reflects the missing mass of a \u03c0 \u25e6 and therefore originates\nfrom the 2\u03c0 \u25e6 production, while the peak at 0 GeV2 indicates the missing mass of a photon and hence the \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p\nproduction. A Monte Carlo simulation of the 2\u03c0 \u25e6 and\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p reactions using GEANT3 [22] reproduces the lineshape of the measured data. The nearly background\nfree identification of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p reaction is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The remaining small 2\u03c0 \u25e6 background\ndue to the finite detector resolution (16% in the highest energy bin) is subtracted for the cross section determination. Since the information of the photon \u03b3 \u2032\nhas not been used for evaluating the missing mass defined in Eq. 1, another kinematic check has to prove\nthat the photon \u03b3 \u2032 is not accidental. Therefore the energy balance was calculated to test energy conservation:\nEBAL = (Ebeam + mp ) \u2212 (E\u03c0\u25e6 + Ep + E\u03b3 \u2032 ) ; the notation\nis the same as in Eq. 1. The energy balance confirms the\nclean identification of the \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p reaction channel.\nThe cross section was deduced from the rate of the\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p events divided by the number of hydrogen atoms\nper cm2 , the photon beam flux, the branching ratio of\n\u03c0 \u25e6 decay into two photons, and the detector and analysis\nefficiency. The intensity of the photon beam was determined by counting the scattered electrons in the tagger\n\n\f3\n\n\u221a\nFIG. 3: Differential cross sections for three different incident excitation energies s in the CM frame.

The geometrical detector acceptance and analysis efficiency due to\ncuts and thresholds were obtained using the GEANT3\ncode and an event generator producing distributions of\nthe final state particles according to [9]. The systematic\nerrors of the efficiency determination are small because\nthe shape of the measured distribution is reproduced by\nthe simulation. The average value for the detection efficiency is 0.25%.\nThe measured differential cross sections for the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p are shown in\n\u221a Fig. 3 for three different\nincident excitation energies s (i.e. the total \u03b3p center of mass energy), starting at the \u2206 resonance position\nand going up to 100 MeV above it. The angular distribution of the photon \u03b3 \u2032 in the CM system shows an\nenhancement for angles around 120\u25e6 . The energy distri\u221a\nbution shifts towards higher \u03b3 \u2032 energies with rising s,\nshowing an 1/E\u03b3 form with an additional peak, where\nthe strength\nand the position depend on the excitation\n\u221a\nenergy s. The different reaction mechanisms suggest\nsuch a behavior, where the 1/E\u03b3 dependence stems from\nthe external bremsstrahlung of the proton in the final\nstate. The position of the peak structure (the energy of\n\u03b3 \u2032 ) originating partly\n\u221a from the \u2206 radiation is determined\nby the difference of s and the \u2206 peak mass and a small\ncorrection due to the available phasespace. The \u2206 decay\nmechanism contribution is emphasized, when the energy\ndifferential cross section is divided by 1/E\u03b3 (compare the\ncolumn on the right hand side of Fig. 3).\n\nThe first series of calculations, including only the resonant \u2206 \u2192 \u2206\u03b3 \u2032 process as indicated in Fig. 1, were done\nby Machavariani et al. [6, 7] and Drechsel et al. [8]. Both\ngroups use the effective Lagrangian formalism and in addition the latter group uses a quark model approach to\ndescribe the reaction. Since these calculations consider\nonly the Feynman diagram which is sensitive to \u03bc\u2206+ ,\nthey cannot reproduce the measured cross sections.\nRecently, Drechsel and Vanderhaeghen [9] extended\ntheir model and included bremsstrahlung diagrams (resonant \u2206, non-resonant Born diagrams and \u03c9 exchange).\nThis calculation is shown in comparison to the measured\ncross sections in Fig. 3. The overall shape is reproduced\nvery well, although the absolute value is overestimated\nfor the highest excitation energy. This is related to a\noverestimate in the calculation of the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 p,\nwhich is well understood and attributed to \u03c0N rescattering contributions [9]. A model independent determination of the \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p cross section is feasible in the soft\nphoton limit, which relates \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2032 p production to \u03c0 \u25e6 p production in the limit of vanishing photon energy E\u03b3 \u2032 [23]:\nlim\n\nE\u03b3 \u2032 \u21920\n\n\u03c30 =\n\nZ\n\nv=\n\nr\n\nd\u03a9\u03c0\u25e6\n1\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c3\nd\u03a9\u03c0\u25e6\n\n4m2p\nt\n\n,\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n*\n\nd\u03c3\ndE\u03b3 \u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n2\u03b1em\n\u03c0\n\n=\n\n\u001a\u0012\n\n1\n* \u03c30\nE\u03b3 \u2032\n\n(2)\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\nv 2 +1\nv+1\nln\n\u22121\n2v\nv\u22121\n\nt = (k \u2212 p\u03c0\u25e6 )2\n\n\f4\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9\u03c0\u25e6 labels the differential cross section for \u03c0 \u25e6 p production, mp the proton mass, t the four momentum\ntransfer between the initial photon and the \u03c0 \u25e6 meson\nand \u03b1em = e2 /4\u03c0 \u2248 1/137. According to Eqn. 2, the energy differential cross section divided by \u03c30 /E\u03b3 \u2032 should\nbe equal to 1 in the limit of zero photon energy E\u03b3 \u2032 .\nThis ratio is shown in the right column of Fig. 3, where\nthe differential cross section d\u03c3/d\u03a9\u03c0\u25e6 in Eqn. 2 is calculated with the same effective Lagrangian model [9]. For\ncomparison to the experimental results, the data are also\nplotted as a cross section ratio where \u03c30 has been determined from Eqn. 2 using consistently the measured\ndifferential cross section d\u03c3/d\u03a9\u03c0\u25e6 of the \u03b3p \u2192 \u03c0 \u25e6 p reaction. The cross section ratios show better agreement;\nthey are less sensitive to uncertainties in the model calculation as well as uncertainties in the determination of\nthe photon flux and target length.\nThe sensitivity to the magnetic moment of the \u2206+ is\nillustrated in Fig. 3 by the difference of the three curves.\nThe \u2206+ magnetic moment can be obtained from the\nanomalous magnetic moment \u03ba\u2206+ which is the only free\nparameter of the calculation [9]\n\u03bc\u2206+ = (1 + \u03ba\u2206+ ) *\n\ne\nmN\n= (1 + \u03ba\u2206+ ) *\n* \u03bcN\n2m\u2206\nm\u2206\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bcN = e/2mN is the nuclear magneton.

This error does not include the systematic error of the model calculation which is of the order\nof \u00b13\u03bcN , estimated from the uncertainties discusssed in\n[9].

We see a clear deviation from a soft bremsstrahlung cross section at higher\nenergies of the radiated photon, pointing to a sentitivity to the magnetic moment of the \u2206+ (1232) resonance.\nHowever, the limited statistics and the uncertainty of the\nmodel lead to a value of the \u2206+ (1232) magnetic moment,\nwhich is not sufficiently precise for a detailed test of different baryon structure calculations. This situation calls\nfor a follow up experiment with much higher statistical\nprecision, using so that the kinematic regions most sensitive to \u03bc\u2206+ can be exploited [9, 24]. An investigation\nof the cross section asymmetry using a polarized photon\nbeam would also be valuable. Supplementary, an improvement in the theoretical description is necessary to\nminimize the model dependence. The measurement can\nbe extended to higher excited states of the nucleon. In\nparticular the magnetic moment of the S11 (1535) resonance is accessible via the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 \u2032 p because of\nits clean distinction from other resonances in the second\nresonance region through the \u03b7 channel.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge inspiring discussions\nwith M.
