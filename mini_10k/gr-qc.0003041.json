In particular, much\nattention has been given to cosmic strings' models since they are possible\nsources for the density perturbations which seeded galaxy formation. A relevant mechanism to understand the structure formation by cosmic strings\ninvolves long strings moving with relativistic speed in the normal plane, giving rise to velocity perturbations in their wake. If the string is moving with\nnormal velocity vs through matter, a velocity perturbation u = 8\u03c0G\u03bcvs \u03b3\n(where \u03bc is the linear mass density of the string and \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 vs2 )\u22121/2 ) towards the plane behind the string results [2]. The study of the effects of a\ncosmic string passing through matter is of great importance to understand\nthe current organization of matter in the Universe and in this context, many\nauthors have already considered this problem in General Relativity [3-8].\nOn the other hand, it is to notice that all implications of structure formation by cosmic strings have been done in the framework of General Relativity.\nNevertheless, it is generally believed that gravity may not be described by\nEinstein's action at sufficiently high energy scales where gravity becomes\nscalar-tensorial in nature. Indeed, most attempts to unify gravity with the\nother interactions predict the existence of one (or many) scalar(s) field(s)\nwith gravitational-strength coupling. If gravity is essentially scalar-tensorial,\nthere will be direct implications for cosmology and experimental tests of the\ngravitational phenomena. In particular, all of them will be affected by the\nvariation of the gravitational \"constant\" G\u03030 .\n2\n\n\fTopological defects have been already considered in the context of a\nscalar-tensorial gravity. In particular, the authors in ref. [9, 10] have studied\nthe solutions for domain walls and cosmic strings in the simplest scalartensorial gravity - the Brans-Dicke theory; in ref. [11] the authors have\nstudied the cosmic string in the dilaton gravity, and finally, in ref. [12], the\nauthor has considered a local cosmic string model in more general scalartensor theories in which the conformal factor is an arbitrary function of the\nscalar field. More recently, superconducting strings have been considered in\nBrans-Dicke [13] and in more general scalar-tensor theories [14].\nIn this work, we consider the formation and evolution of cosmic strings\nwakes in a scalar-tensor gravity. Namely, we are interested in studying the\nimplications of a scalar-tensor coupling for the formation and evolution of\nwakes by a cosmic string with metric described in [12]. For this purpose, we\nconsider a simple model in which non-baryonic cold dark matter composed\nby non-relativistic, collisionless particles propagate around a scalar-tensor\ncosmic string. We anticipate that our main result is to show that the mechanism of formation and evolution of wakes by an (ordinary) cosmic string in\nthe framework of a scalar-tensor theory presents very similar structure to the\nsame mechanism by a wiggly cosmic string in General Relativity.\nThis work is outlined as follows. In section 2, we briefly review the properties of the metric of a scalar-tensor string which we are going to deal with\nthroughout this paper and we derive the linearized geodesic equations associated to it. In section 3, we consider the propagation of non-relativistic,\ncollisionless particles in the metric described in section 2 and we study the\nformation and evolution of wakes in this model. Whenever convenient, we\n3\n\n\freduce our results to the particular case of Brans-Dicke theory and we compare these results with those already obtained in the framework of General\nRelativity. Finally, in section 4, we end with some discussions and conclusions.\n\n2\n\nCosmic String Solution in Scalar-Tensor Theories\n\nWe start by considering a class of scalar-tensor theories developed by Bergman\n[15], Wagoner [16] and Nordtverdt [17] in which the scalar sector of the gravitational interaction is massless. For technical purpose, it is better to work\nin the so-called Einstein (conformal) frame in which the kinematic terms of\ntensor and scalar fields do not mix. Then, a cosmic string solution arises\nfrom the action:\nS =\n\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd4 x \u2212g [R \u2212 2g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6] +\n16\u03c0G\u2217\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n1\n1\n4 \u221a\n\u03bc \u2217\n\u03bc\u03bd\nd x \u2212g D\u03bc \u03a6D \u03a6 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u2212 V (| \u03a6 |) ,\n2\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is a pure rank-2 metric tensor, R is the curvature scalar associated\nto it and G\u2217 is some \"bare\" gravitational coupling constant. The second term\nin the r.h.s. of eq. (1) is the matter action representing an Abelian-Higgs\nmodel where a charged scalar Higgs field \u03a6 minimally couples to the U(1)\ngauge field A\u03bc and V (| \u03a6 |) is the Higgs potential [12].\nAction (1) is obtained from the original action appearing in the refs.\n\n4\n\n\f[15-17] by a conformal transformation (see, for instance, [18])\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = A2 (\u03c6)g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd is the physical metric which contains both scalar and tensor degrees\nof freedom, and by a redefinition of the quantities\nG\u2217 A2 (\u03c6) =\n\n1\n,\n\u03a6\u0303\n\nwhere \u03a6\u0303 is the original scalar field, and\n\u03b1(\u03c6) \u2261\n\n1\n\u2202 ln A\n,\n=\n1\n\u2202\u03c6\n[2\u03c9(\u03a6\u0303) + 3] 2\n\nwhich can be interpreted as the (field-dependent) coupling strenght between\nmatter and the scalar field. We choose to leave A2 (\u03c6) as an arbitrary function\nof the scalar field.\nThe metric of a self-gravitating string can be found in the weak-field\napproximation. Expanding the tensor g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd +h\u03bc\u03bd and scalar \u03c6 = \u03c60 +\u03c6(1)\nfields, with | h\u03bc\u03bd |\u226a 1 and\n\"\n\n\u03c6(1)\n\u03c60\n\n\u226a 1, it was, then, found [12]:\n\n#\uf8ee\n\n\u03c1 \uf8f0 2\n\u03c1\nds2 = 1 + 8G0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 ) ln\ndt \u2212 dz2 \u2212 d\u03c12 \u2212 (1 \u2212 8G0 \u03bc)\n\u03c10\n\u03c10\n\n!2\n\n\uf8f9\n\nd\u03b82 \uf8fb\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\u03c6(1) = 4G0 \u03bc\u03b1(\u03c60) ln \u03c1/\u03c10 ,\nin a cylindrical coordinate system such that \u03c1 \u2265 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. G0 is\n\ndefined as G0 \u2261 G\u2217 A2 (\u03c60 ). Notice that this is not the effective Newtonian\n\nconstant G\u03030 = G\u2217 A2 (\u03c60 )[1 + \u03b12 ]\u03c60 as defined in [18]. \u03c10 is a distance beyond\n\nwhich all matter fields drop away. Conveniently, it has the same order of\n5\n\n\fmagnitude of the string radius. It is interesting to note that the metric of\na scalar-tensor string in the weak-field approximation (3) is fully described\nin terms of one dimensional coupling strength (G0 ) and one post-Newtonian\nparameter (\u03b1(\u03c60 )). One new feature of a scalar-tensor string is that it exerts gravitational force on test particles, contrary to its General Relativity\npartner. From (3), we can easily see that this gravitational force on a test\nparticle of mass m is given by\nf = \u22124mG0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 )\n\n1\n\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\nand it is always attractive.\n\nPropagation of Massive Particles and Light\nLet us define a new coordinate system by means of the transformation x =\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c1 cos[(1 \u2212 8G0 \u03bc) 2 \u03b8 + 4\u03c0G0 \u03bc] and y = \u03c1 sin[(1 \u2212 8G0 \u03bc) 2 \u03b8 + 4\u03c0G0 \u03bc] in such\na way that the missing wedge is placed on the positive side of the x-axis.\nThen, metric (3) assumes a simple form:\nds2 = (1 + h00 )[dt2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy2 \u2212 dz2 ]\n\n(5)\n\n1\n\nwhere h00 = 8G0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 ) ln[(x2 +y 2) 2 ]. Metric (5) is conformally Minkowskian\nand has a missing wedge of angular width \u2206 = 8\u03c0G0 \u03bc.\nNow we are in a position to study the propagation of massive and massless\nparticles in metric (5). Since this metric is conformal to Minkowski minus a\nwedge, any massless particles (such as photons) will be deflected by an angle\nequal to 8\u03c0G0 \u03bc. From the observational point of view, it would be impossible\nto distinguish a scalar-tensor string from its General Relativity partner just\n6\n\n\fby considering effects based on deflection of light (i.e., double image effect, for\ninstance). On the other hand, trajectories of massive particles will be affected\nby the scalar-tensor coupling (which generates the gravitational force (4)) as\nwell as by the conical geometry. If the string is moving with normal velocity\nvs through matter, a velocity perturbation\nu = 8\u03c0G0 \u03bcvs \u03b3 +\n\n4\u03c0G0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 )\n,\nvs \u03b3\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 vs2 )\u2212 2 , towards the plane behind the string results [12]. The\nfirst term is equivalent to the relative velocity of particles flowing past a string\nin General Relativity and is due to the conical geometry. The second term\nappears due to the scalar-tensor coupling of the gravitational interaction.\nLet us make an estimative of the order of magnitude of the corrected\nterm induced by the scalar field in expression (6). It is very illustrative to\nconsider a particular form for the arbitrary function A(\u03c6), corresponding to\nthe Brans-Dicke theory, A(\u03c6) = e\u03b1\u03c6 , with \u03b12 =\ncase, we have that G\u2217 A2 (\u03c60 ) = G0 =\n\n\u0010\n\n2\u03c9+3\n2\u03c9+4\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n, (\u03c9\n2\u03c9+3\n\n= cte).

Matter moves toward this surface\nby gravitational attraction, and a wake is formed behind the string. The aim\nof this section is to study the implication of a scalar-tensor coupling for the\nformation and evolution of a wake behind a string which generates the metric\n(5). For this purpose, we will mimic this situation with a simple model in\nwhich cold dark matter composed by non-relativistic collisionless particles\nmoves past a long scalar-tensor string. In our approach, particles propagate\n\u221a\nin the plane orthogonal to the string in a region \u03c1 \u2261 x2 + y 2 \u226b R0 , where\nR0 is the size of a region beyond which the string's small-structures do not\naffect the motion.\nThe geodesics associated to metric (5)\n2\u1e8d = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u1e8b2 \u2212 \u1e8f 2)\u2202x h00\n2\u00ff = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u1e8b2 \u2212 \u1e8f 2)\u2202y h00 ,\n8\n\n\fwhere (*) refers to derivative with respect to the coordinate t, can be integrated over the unperturbed trajectories x = X0 + vs t and y = y0 .

X0 is a long distance cut-off of order of the\ninterstring separation.\nIntegrating (8) again and writing y as function of x, we have:\n1 \u2212 vs2\ny = y0 \u22124G0 \u03bc\u03b1 (\u03c60 )\nvs2\n2\n\nx\nX0\ny0\nx2 + y02\nx arctan \u2212 arctan\n+ ln\ny0\ny0\n2\nX02 + Y02\n(9)\n\n!( \"\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nWith the orbit given by (9), we can infer how particles accrete onto the wakes.\n\u221a\nThis is better seen in polar coordinates (\u03c1, \u03b8), such that \u03c1 = x2 + y 2 and\n\u03b8 is the angle measured from the x-axis. If we assume that particles moving\ntoward the string come from both sides from impact parameters \u03b4R and \u03b4R\n\n\u2032\n\nand that the number of particles crossing the element \u03b4\u03c1 into the foward cone\nper unit time per unit length of string is \u03bdvs \u03b4R, with \u03bd as the initial number\ndensity of particles, then the number density of particles entering the cone\nat element \u03b4\u03c1 is ne (\u03c1, \u03b8) = \u03bd R\u03c1 \u03b4R\nand the number of particles leaving the\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u2032\n\ncone is nl (\u03c1, \u03b8) = \u03bd R\u03c1\u2032 \u03b4R\n. In both cases, we have used the conservation of\n\u03b4\u03c1\nangular momentum in order to calculate the velocity normal to the surface\nof the cone Rvs /\u03c1 [8].\nIf we re-write orbit (9) in terms of the polar coordinates and differentiate\n9\n\n#)\n\n\fwith respect to y0 , we find:\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03c1 cos \u03b8 \u2212 X0\nR\n\u03b4R\n1 + 4G0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 )\n=\n.\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03c1\nX02 + R2\n\n(10)\n\nTherefore, we can now compute the number density of particles in the volume\nelement \u03b4\u03c1:\n\"\n\n1\n1\nn \u2261 ne + nl = \u03bd 2 + 4G0 \u03bc\u03b1 (\u03c60 )X0 (x \u2212 X0 )\n+ 2\n2\n2\nX0 + R\nX0 + R \u2032 2\n2\n\n!#\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich holds just inside the wake.\nLet us now compute the density fluctuation inside and outside the wake.\nWe have, then, respectively:\n\u03b4n\nn\u2212\u03bd\nx \u2212 X0\n,\n\u2261\n\u2248 1 + 8G0 \u03bc\u03b12(\u03c60 )\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nX0\n\n(12)\n\nx \u2212 X0\n\u03b4ne\n.\n\u2248 4G0 \u03bc\u03b12 (\u03c60 )\n\u03bd\nX0\n\n(13)\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nand\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\n\nIn both cases, we restricted ourselves to R, R \u226a X0 .\nWe can now compare our results with those already known in the litterature. In General Relativity, the orbit of a test particle is deviated from its\nunperturbed trajectory because of the conical geometry and , in this case, the\ntwo opposite streams of matter in the wake overlap within the wedge with\nopening 8\u03c0G\u03bc and the inside matter density is doubled. In a scalar-tensor\ngravity, this scenario is changed and some new effects occur. Namely, the\nparticle's original trajectory is also perturbed by the presence of the scalar\nfield and a new term induced by the gravitational force (4) appears. Outside\nthe wake, since x < X0 , \u03b4ne given by (13) is negative which means that\n10\n\n\fthis region is underdense. An important result of this analysis is that the\nstructure of the formed wake in scalar-tensor gravity is very similar to the\none in the case of a wiggly string in General Relativity [8]. We will explore\nthis similarity in more detail in the section 4.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Evolution of Wakes: The Zel'dovich Approximation\n\nLet us now make a quantitative description of accretion onto wakes using\nthe Zel'dovich approximation, which consists in considering the Newtonian\naccretion problem in an expanding Universe using the method of linear perturbations. Let us consider that a wake is formed by the scalar-tensor string\nat ti > teq . The physical trajectory of a dark-particle can be written as\nh(~x, t) = a(t)[~x + \u03c8(~x, t)] ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere ~x is the unperturbed comoving position of the particle and \u03c8(~x, t) is\nthe comoving displacement developed as a consequence of the gravitational\nattraction induced by the wake on the particle. If we assume that the wake\nis perpendicular to the x-axis, then the only non-vanishing component of \u03c8\nis \u03c8x . Therefore, the equation of motion for a dark particle in the Newtonian\nlimit is\n\u1e27 = \u2212\u2207h \u03a6 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the Newtonian potential satisfies the Poisson's equation:\n\u22072h \u03a6 = 4\u03c0G0 \u03c1 .\n11\n\n(16)\n\n\fIn equation (16), \u03c1(t) is the dark matter density in a cold-dark matter Universe. Thus, the linearized equation for \u03c8x becomes\n\u00e4\n\u0227\n\u03c8\u0308 + 2 \u03c8\u0307 + 3 \u03c8 = 0 .\na\na\n\n(17)\n\nFor simplicity, we consider hereafter that the Universe is flat. Therefore\n2\n\na(t) \u221d t 3 in the matter-dominated era such that t > teq , and equation (17)\nbecomes:\n\u03c8\u0308 +\n\n2\n4\n\u03c8\u0307 \u2212 2 \u03c8 = 0 ,\n3t\n3t\n\n(18)\n\nwith appropriate initial conditions: \u03c8(ti ) = 0 and \u03c8\u0307(ti ) = \u2212ui . Equation\n(18) is the Euler equation whose solution can be easily found:\nt\n3 ui t2i\n\u2212 ui ti\n\u03c8(x, t) =\n5 t\nti\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 #\n3\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nThe comoving coordinate x(t) can be calculated using the fact that \u1e23 = 0\nin the \"turn around\". That is, eventually, the dark particle stops expanding\nwith the Hubble flow and starts to collapse onto the wake. This means that\n\u1e23 = 0, or equivalently, x + 2\u03c8(x, t) = 0. This yields\n6 ui t2i\nt\nx(t) = \u2212\n\u2212 ui ti\n5 t\nti\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132 #\n3\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nCalculating now the thickness d(t) and the surface density \u03c3(t) of the wake,\nwe have, respectively:\n\uf8ee\n\n4/3\n\n\uf8f9\n\n12 \uf8f0 t4/3 ti \uf8fb\nui 1/3 \u2212 1/3 ,\nd(t) =\n5\nt\nti\n\n\uf8ee\n\n4/3\n\n\uf8f9\n\n2ui \uf8f0 t4/3 ti \uf8fb\n\u03c3(t) = \u03c1(t)d(t) =\n\u2212 1/3 ,\n5\u03c0G0 t2 t1/3\nt\ni\n12\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere we have used the average density \u03c1(t) =\n\n1\n6\u03c0G0 t2\n\nin the matter-dominated\n\nera for a flat Universe. Clearly, we see that wakes which are formed at ti \u223c teq\nhave largest surface density [3] and (21) reduces to\n\u0012 \u00131/3\n\n2ui\nt\n\u03c3(t) \u2248\n5\u03c0G0 t ti\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\nReplacing expression (6) for ui in (22), we finally have:\n\u03b12\n2vs \u03b3 +\n,\nvs \u03b3\n\n\u0012 \u00131/3 \"\n\n8\u03bc t\n\u03c3(t) \u2248\n5 t ti\n\n#\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the second term in r.h.s. is the dilaton's contribution to the wake's\nsurface density and, as we have already seen in section 2, this term is more\nthan 230 times less than the purely geometrical contribution.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThe aim of this work was to make a first step toward the understanding\nof the formation and evolution of cosmic string wakes in the context of a\nscalar-tensor gravity. For this purpose, in section 3, we studied the motion of non-relativistic, collisionless particles in the metric of a scalar-tensor\nstring described in section 2. The linearized geodesic equations found in section 2 were integrated over the unperturbed trajectories which allowed us to\ncalculate the density fluctuations inside and outside the formed wake. The\npresence of the dilaton has interesting physical consequences. The dilaton\nqualitatively alters the particles number density (11) with respect to what\noccurs in General Relativity. In the latter case, the particles number density\ncrossing the element \u03b4\u03c1 is just twice the initial density, while in the former\n13\n\n\fcase we have an additional term which expresses the dilaton's contribution\nto the generation of wakes. Analysing expression (13) for the density fluctuation outside the wake, again the dilaton alters the previous result obtained\nin General Relativity. Since x < X0 on the side of the coming fluid, we see\nthat \u03b4n in this region is negative which expresses an underdensity outside\nthe wakes. The evolution of the wake was investigated using the Zel'dovich\napproximation. Thickness, surface density and \"turn around\" surfaces were\ncomputed.\nIt was shown that the presence of the dilaton produces an effect which is\nvery similar to the effect of the string's wiggles on the formation of the wakes,\nalbeit our model is the one for an ordinary string. Comparing numerically\nboth models, it seems that the dilaton's contribution can be neglected in\nfavour of the wiggles' contribution: For instance, expression (13) for the\ninside density fluctuation is 103 orders of magnitude less than its analogue\nin the wiggly string in General Relativity [8]. However, we believe that this\nshould not be seen with \"pessimist eyes\": the (small) upper bound to the\nvalue of \u03b12 in the matter era is just a confirmation that if gravity was really\nscalar-tensorial in early eras it evoluted to General Relativity in the present\nera [18]. At early epochs, it is expected that the scalar's contribution was\nof the same order of the tensor's one. Once the dilaton still contributes\nto the wake's surface density and this contribution may lead to interesting\ncosmological consequences.\nWakes produced by moving strings can provide an explanation for filamentary and sheet-like structures observed in the Universe [22]. The wake\nproduced by the string in one Hubble time has the shape of a strip of width\n14\n\n\f\u223c vs ti . With the help of the surface density (23), we can easily compute the\nwake's linear mass density, say \u03bc\u0303,\n\u03b12\n2vs \u03b3 +\n,\n\u03b3\n\n\u0012 \u00132/3 \"\n\n8\u03bc t\n\u03bc\u0303 \u2248\n5 ti\n\n#\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we see that the dilaton's contribution independ on the string velocity.\nIf the string moves slower or if we extrapolate our results to earlier epochs\nof the Universe when the parameter 1/\u03c9 has been much larger, we conclude\nthat the second term in r.h.s. of eq. (24) will dominate over the GR term.\nTherefore, the dilatonic wake would have direct implications on the formation\nof large-scale structure in the Universe.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Apoio \u00e0 Pesquisa do\nDistrito Federal (FAPDF).
