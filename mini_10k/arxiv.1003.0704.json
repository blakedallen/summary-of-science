The general belief is that any such action, with some\nadditional non-triviality conditions, must essentially be an algebraic double coset\nof the form K\\H/\u0393. More precisely, such coset is given by some Lie group H\ntogether with a homomorphism G \u2192 H, a lattice \u0393 \u2282 H and a compact subgroup\nK \u2282 H centralizing the image of G in H. The G-action is then given by the\nnatural left action on K\\H/\u0393. We note that when H is semisimple these G-actions\nare isometric for a metric induced by the Killing form of the Lie algebra of H.\nSome results have already been obtained in [15, 16] proving that suitable geometric\nconditions imply that such G-actions are of the double coset type. We refer to\n[2, 3, 9] for similar related results.\nIn this work we observe, that for M complete and weakly irreducible with the\nG-action non-transitive but with a dense orbit, the dimension of M has a bound\nfrom below in terms of the representation theoretic properties of g, the Lie algebra\nof G. More precisely, it is noted in Proposition 1.6 that in this case we have\ndim(M ) \u2265 dim(G) + m(g),\n\nwhere m(g) denotes the dimension of the smallest non-trivial representation of g\nthat admits an invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form.

For SO\np + q \u2265 4, the following result establishes that the lower bound just considered can\nbe achieved only for double coset models. Note that for a G-action on a manifold\nM and X in the Lie algebra of G we denote by X \u2217 the vector field on M whose oneparameter group of diffeomorphisms is given by (exp(tX))t through the G-action\non M .\nMain Theorem. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold.\nSuppose that M is complete weakly irreducible, has finite volume and admits an\nf 0 (p, q)-action with a dense orbit, for some integers p, q\nanalytic and isometric SO\nsuch that p, q \u2265 1 and n = p + q \u2265 5. In this case we have m(so(p, q)) = n. If the\nequality:\nf 0 (p, q)) + m(so(p, q)) = n(n + 1) ,\ndim(M ) = dim(SO\n2\nf 0 (p, q + 1) or SO\nf 0 (p + 1, q) there exist:\nholds, then for H either SO\n(1) a lattice \u0393 \u2282 H, and\n(2) an analytic finite covering map \u03c6 : H/\u0393 \u2192 M ,\nf 0 (p, q)-equivariant, where the SO\nf 0 (p, q)-action on H/\u0393 is induced\nsuch that \u03c6 is SO\nf\nby some non-trivial homomorphism SO0 (p, q) \u2192 H. Furthermore, we can rescale\nf 0 (p, q)-orbits and their normal bundle to assume that\nthe metric on M along the SO\n\u03c6 is a local isometry for the bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric on H given by\nthe Killing form of its Lie algebra. The result holds for the case (p, q) = (3, 1) as\nwell if we further assume that X \u2217 \u22a5 Y \u2217 on M for all X \u2208 su(2) and Y \u2208 isu(2)\nunder the identification so(3, 1) \u2243 sl(2, C).\n\nNote that there is no R-rank restriction, and so this result applies to the groups\nf 0 (p, 1) when p \u2265 3. Thus, the Main Theorem provides a rigidity result for\nSO\nSO0 (p, 1)-actions.\nThe proof of the Main Theorem is based on the application of representation\ntheory to the Killing vector fields centralizing the G-action, where the latter are\nas found in Gromov-Zimmer's machinery (see [10, 22]). With respect to centralizing Killing fields, our main ingredient is Proposition 1.2 as already found in\n[7, 10, 16, 22] with varying assumptions on the manifold M acted upon by G.\nProposition 1.2 ensures the existence of a Lie algebra g(x), isomorphic to g, of\nKilling fields vanishing at a point x on the universal cover of M and with some\nadditional properties. The Lie algebra g(x) provides a g-module structure to the\ntangent space Tx M that allows to use representation theory to control the behavior\nof the normal to the orbits. Such g-module structure is then related to the Lie\nalgebra H of Killing vector fields centralizing the G-action (see Lemma 1.8), thus\nagain providing control on H. By Gromov-Zimmer's machinery, the Lie algebra of\nH has an open dense orbit in the universal covering space of M . Also, the Lie algebra H yields a Lie group action constructed in Section 1. These elements together\nallow to obtain a very detailed description of the structure of H, which is provided\nin Section 2. Here again, the application of representation theory is a key element.\nFinally, Section 3 completes the proof of the Main Theorem using the Lie group\naction induced by H and the weak irreducibility assumption on M . Some needed\nfacts about the Lie algebra so(p, q) are collected in Appendix A. We will use the\nnotation from the introduction and the Appendix without further comments.\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n3\n\n1. Isometric actions of simple Lie groups and Killing fields\nIn this section, we let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group with Lie\nalgebra g and M a connected finite volume pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Hence,\nevery isometric G-action on M with a dense orbit is locally free (see [17, 19]) and so\nthe orbits define a foliation that we will denote with O. The bundle T O tangent to\nthe foliation O is a trivial vector bundle isomorphic to M \u00d7g, under the isomorphism\nM \u00d7 g \u2192 T O given by (x, X) 7\u2192 Xx\u2217 . This also defines an isomorphism of every\nfiber Tx O with g. We will refer to it as the natural isomorphism between Tx O and\ng. Recall that, as before and in the rest of this article, for X in the Lie algebra\nof a group acting on a manifold, we denote by X \u2217 the vector field on the manifold\nwhose one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms is given by (exp(tX))t through the\naction on the manifold. On the other hand, we will have the occasion to consider\nboth left and right actions and so our convention is to assume that an action is on\nthe left unless otherwise specified.\nFor any given pseudo-Riemannian manifold N , we will denote by Kill(N ) the\nglobally defined Killing vector fields of N . Also, we denote by Kill0 (N, x) the Lie\nalgebra of globally defined Killing vector fields that vanish at the given point x.\nThe following result is an easy application of the Jacobi identity and the fact that\nKilling vector fields are derivations of the corresponding metric. Also note that,\nin the rest of this work, for a vector space W with a non-degenerate symmetric\nbilinear form, we will denote with so(W ) the Lie algebra of linear maps on W that\nare skew-symmetric with respect to the bilinear form.\nLemma 1.1. Let N be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and x \u2208 N . Then, the map\n\u03bbx : Kill0 (N, x) \u2192 so(Tx N ) given by \u03bbx (Z)(v) = [Z, V ]x , where V is any vector\nfield such that Vx = v, is a well defined homomorphism of Lie algebras.\nFor any given point x of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the map \u03bbx will denote\nfrom now on the homomorphism from the previous lemma.\nGromov [10] proved that the presence of a geometric structure of finite type (in\nthe sense of Cartan) which is invariant under the action of a simple Lie group yields\nlarge spaces of Killing vector fields fixing given points in the manifold being acted\nupon. We refer to [22] for a detailed description of these techniques. The statement\nbelow in the case of germs of Killing fields is essentially contained in Section 9 of\n[7] (see also Proposition 2.3 in [16]). From this, the result for global Killing vector\nf is analytic and simply connected (see [7, 10, 22]).\nfields is straightforward since M\nObserve that, following our notation with M , we denote with O the foliation by\ne\nf.\nG-orbits\nin M\nProposition 1.2.

Also, consider the g-valued 2-form given by \u03a9 = d\u03c9|\u22272 T O\u22a5 . The following result\nis elementary and a proof can be found in [16].\nLemma 1.3. Let G, M and S be as in Proposition 1.2.

Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group acting isometrically and with a dense orbit on a connected finite volume pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold M . If dim(M ) < 2 dim(G), then the bundles T O and T O\u22a5 have fibers\nthat are non-degenerate with respect to the metric on M .\nIt turns out that for complete manifolds, if the G-orbits are non-degenerate and\nthe normal bundle to such orbits is integrable, then the universal covering space\ncan be split. Such a claim is the content of the following proposition which is a\nparticular case of Theorem 1.1 of [16]. This result is in the spirit of similar ones\nfound in [5, 6, 10].\nProposition 1.5. Let G be a connected non-compact simple Lie group acting isometrically on a connected complete finite volume pseudo-Riemannian manifold M .\nIf the tangent bundle to the orbits T O has non-degenerate fibers and the bundle\ne \u00d7 N \u2192 M where\nT O\u22a5 is integrable, then there is an isometric covering map G\ne and with N a\nthe domain has the product metric for a bi-invariant metric on G\ncomplete pseudo-Riemannian manifold.\nAs a consequence, we obtain a lower bound on the dimension of M .\nProposition 1.6. Let M be a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold and\nG a connected non-compact simple Lie group. Suppose that M is complete weakly\nirreducible, has finite volume and admits an analytic isometric non-transitive Gaction with a dense orbit.

Suppose that dim(M ) < dim(G) + m(g). Since m(g) \u2264 dim(G) (the Killing\nform defines an inner product), by Lemma 1.4 the bundle T O\u22a5 has non-degenerate\nfibers with dimension < m(g). Hence, the definition of m(g) implies that Tx O\u22a5 is a\ntrivial g-module for the structure defined by Proposition 1.2(4). Hence, Lemma 1.3\nyields the integrability of T O\u22a5 , and Proposition 1.5 contradicts the irreducibility\nof M .\n\u0003\nf endowed with the G-action\ne\nFor a G-action as in Proposition 1.2, consider M\nobtained by lifting the G-action on M .

In\nparticular, \u03c1bx induces on H a g-module structure such that G(x) is a submodule\nisomorphic to g.\n\nProof. First, observe that the identity in Proposition 1.2(3) is easily seen to imply\nthat the image of \u03c1bx lies in H.\nTo prove that \u03c1bx is a homomorphism of Lie algebras we apply Proposition 1.2(3)\nas follows for X, Y \u2208 g:\n[b\n\u03c1x (X), \u03c1bx (Y )] = [\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 , \u03c1x (Y ) + Y \u2217 ]\n\n= [\u03c1x (X), \u03c1x (Y )] + [\u03c1x (X), Y \u2217 ] + [X \u2217 , \u03c1x (Y )] + [X \u2217 , Y \u2217 ]\n= \u03c1x ([X, Y ]) + [X, Y ]\u2217 + [X, Y ]\u2217 + [X \u2217 , Y \u2217 ]\n= \u03c1x ([X, Y ]) + [X, Y ]\u2217\n= \u03c1bx ([X, Y ]).\n\nFor the injectivity of \u03c1bx we observe that \u03c1bx (X) = 0 implies Xx\u2217 = (\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 )x =\n0, which in turns yields X = 0 because the G-action is locally free. The last claim\nis now clear.\n\u0003\nf.\nWe can now relate the g-module structure of H to that of Tx M\n\nf and H endowed with\nLemma 1.8. Let S be as in Proposition 1.2.

Furthermore, for\nf.\nalmost every x \u2208 S we have evx (H) = Tx M\nProof. For every x \u2208 S, if we let Z \u2208 H and X \u2208 g be given, then:\nevx (X * Z) = [b\n\u03c1x (X), Z]x = [\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 , Z]x\n\n= [\u03c1x (X), Z]x = X * Zx = X * evx (Z)\n\n\f6\n\nGESTUR OLAFSSON AND RAUL QUIROGA-BARRANCO\n\nwhere we have used Lemma 1.1 and the definition of the g-module structures involved, thus proving the first part. The last claim follows by an easy adaptation of\nthe proof of Lemma 4.1 of [23], which establishes the transitivity of H on an open\nf.\nconull dense subset of M\n\u0003\n\nTo study in the following sections those G-actions for which T O\u22a5 is non-integrable\nwe will need to use some known results that relate isometries with Killing fields for\ncomplete manifolds. First, we have the following result, which follows from the\nrigidity (in the sense of [10]) of pseudo-Riemannian metrics and their basic properties.\nLemma 1.9. Let N be an analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Then, every\nKilling vector field of N , either local or global, is analytic. In particular, the isometry group Iso(N ) acts analytically on N.\nBy Proposition 30 of Chapter 9 from [13], on a complete pseudo-Riemannian\nmanifold every global Killing vector field is complete. Hence, Proposition 33 of\nChapter 9 from [13] has the following immediate consequence.\nLemma 1.10. Let N be a complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold and suppose that\nthe action of its isometry group Iso(N ) is considered on the left. If Iso(N ) denotes\nthe Lie algebra of Iso(N ), then the map:\nIso(N ) \u2192 Kill(N ),\n\nX 7\u2192 X \u2217 ,\n\nis an anti-isomorphism of Lie algebras. In particular, [X, Y ]\u2217 = \u2212[X \u2217 , Y \u2217 ] for\nevery X, Y \u2208 Iso(N ).\n\nWe now use the above to prove that on a complete manifold every Lie algebra\nof Killing fields can be realized from an isometric right action.\n\nLemma 1.11. Let N be a complete pseudo-Riemannian manifold and H a simply\nconnected Lie group with Lie algebra h. If \u03c8 : h \u2192 Kill(N ) is a homomorphism of\nLie algebras, then there exists an isometric right H-action N \u00d7 H \u2192 N such that\n\u03c8(X) = X \u2217 , for every X \u2208 h. Furthermore, if N is analytic, then the H-action is\nanalytic as well.\nProof. Consider the map \u03b1 : Iso(N ) \u2192 Kill(N ) given by \u03b1(Y ) = \u2212Y \u2217 , which\nis an isomorphism of Lie algebras by Lemma 1.10. Let \u03a8 : H \u2192 Iso(N ) be the\nhomomorphism of Lie groups induced by the homomorphism \u03b1\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c8 : h \u2192 Iso(n).\nThis yields a smooth isometric right H-action given by:\nN \u00d7 H \u2192 N,\n\n(n, h) 7\u2192 nh = \u03a8(h\u22121 )(n).\n\nFor X \u2208 h there is Y \u2208 Iso(N ) such that \u03c8(X) = \u2212\u03b1(Y ) = Y \u2217 . Hence, for the\nright H-action one computes X \u2217 at every p \u2208 N as follows:\nd\nd\np exp(tX) =\n\u03a8(exp(\u2212tX))(p)\nXp\u2217 =\ndt t=0\ndt t=0\nd\nd\n=\nexp(\u2212t(\u03b1\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c8)(X))p =\nexp(tY )p\ndt t=0\ndt t=0\n= Yp\u2217 = \u03c8(X)p ,\nwhich proves the first part of the lemma. Note that the first and second to last\nidentities use the definition of Z \u2217 for the right H-action and the left Iso(N )-action,\nrespectively. Finally, the last part of our statement follows from the last claim of\nLemma 1.9.\n\u0003\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n7\n\nf 0 (p, q)-actions for\n2.

We will now see\nthat our hypotheses allow to provide a precise description of the so(p, q)-module\nstructures obtained through these results from the previous section.\nLemma 2.1. Let S be as in Proposition 1.2. Consider Tx O\u22a5 endowed with the\nso(p, q)-module structure given by Proposition 1.2(4). Then, for almost every x \u2208 S:\n(1) for (p, q) 6= (4, 4), the so(p, q)-module Tx O\u22a5 is isomorphic to Rp,q , and\n(2) for p = q = 4, the so(4, 4)-module Tx O\u22a5 is isomorphic to either R4,4 , C +\nor C \u2212 .\n\nIn particular, so(Tx O\u22a5 ) is isomorphic to so(p, q) as a Lie algebra and as a so(p, q)module, for almost every x \u2208 S.\nProof. By Lemma 1.3(2) and since we are assuming that T O\u22a5 is non-integrable,\nthe 2-form \u03a9 considered in its statement is non-zero. This 2-form is clearly analytic\nf which is necessarily null.\nand thus it vanishes at a proper analytic subset of M\nHence, \u03a9x 6= 0 for almost every x \u2208 S. Let us choose and fix x \u2208 S such that\n\u03a9x 6= 0; we will prove that the conclusions of the statement hold for such x.\nLemma 1.3(1) implies that the map \u03a9x : \u22272 Tx O\u22a5 \u2192 so(p, q) is a homomorphism\nof so(p, q)-modules, which is then non-trivial by our choice of x. Since dim(Tx O\u22a5 ) =\nn and because so(p, q) is an irreducible module, it follows that \u03a9x is an isomorphism.\nThen, the irreducibility of so(p, q) implies that Tx O\u22a5 is irreducible as well.\n\n\f8\n\nGESTUR OLAFSSON AND RAUL QUIROGA-BARRANCO\n\nBy Lemma A.1 it follows that Tx O\u22a5 \u2243 Rp,q except for the cases given by the\nLie algebras so(3, 1) and so(4, 4). For these Lie algebras the other possibilities are\nC2R for so(3, 1), and real forms C + and C \u2212 of the two half spin representations of\nso(8, C), for the case of so(4, 4).\nLet us consider the case of so(3, 1). If (\u03c0, V ) is a G-module and \u03c7V = tr \u25e6 \u0001\u03c0\nis its character, then for every g \u2208 G we have \u03c7\u22272 V (g) = 12 \u03c7V (g)2 \u2212 \u03c7V (g 2 ) .\nFor our setup, we need to determine\nfor which of V \u2243 R3,1 or V \u2243 C2R we have\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\n\u03c7so(3,1) (g) = 2 \u03c7V (g) \u2212 \u03c7V (g ) .

Since so(p, q) is simple, the\nlatter is injective and so it is an isomorphism.\n\u0003\n\nThe previous results allow us to obtain the following decomposition of the cenf 0 (p, q)-action into submodules related to the geometric structure\ntralizer H of the SO\nf\non M .\n\nLemma 2.2. Let S be as in Proposition 1.2. Then, for almost every x \u2208 S and for\nthe so(p, q)-module structure on H from Lemma 1.7 there is a decomposition into\nso(p, q)-submodules H = G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) \u2295 V(x), satisfying:\n(1) G(x) = \u03c1bx (so(p, q)) is a Lie subalgebra of H isomorphic to so(p, q) and\nevx (G(x)) = Tx O.\n(2) H0 (x) = ker(evx ), which is either 0 or a Lie subalgebra of H isomorphic\nto so(p, q). In the latter case, H0 (x) is also isomorphic to so(p, q) as a\nso(p, q)-module.\n(3) evx (V(x)) = Tx O\u22a5 and\n(a) for (p, q) 6= (4, 4), V(x) is isomorphic to Rp,q as so(p, q)-module,\n(b) for p = q = 4, V(x) is isomorphic to either R4,4 , C + or C \u2212 as so(4, 4)module.\nIn particular, the evaluation map evx defines an isomorphism of so(p, q)-modules\nf = Tx O \u2295 Tx O\u22a5 preserving the summands in that order.\nG(x) \u2295 V(x) \u2192 Tx M\n\nProof. Note that the conclusions of both Lemmas 1.8 and 2.1 are satisfied for\nalmost every x \u2208 S. Let us choose and fix one such point x \u2208 S. By Lemma 1.7, we\nconclude that G(x) = \u03c1bx (so(p, q)) is indeed a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to so(p, q).\nDefine H0 (x) = ker(evx ). By Lemma 1.8, it follows that H0 (x) is an so(p, q)f, x) it follows that it is a\nsubmodule of H. Moreover, since H0 (x) = H \u2229 Kill0 (M\nLie subalgebra as well.\nOn the other hand, the elements of G(x) are of the form \u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 , with\nX \u2208 so(p, q), where \u03c1x is the Lie algebra homomorphism from Proposition 1.2.\nHence, for any such element we have evx (\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 ) = Xx\u2217 ; in particular, the\ncondition evx (\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217) = 0 implies X = 0. In other words, G(x) \u2229 H0 (x) = {0}.\nHence, there exists an so(p, q)-submodule V \u2032 (x) complementary to G(x) \u2295 H0 (x)\nin H. In particular, evx restricted to G(x) \u2295 V \u2032 (x) is an isomorphism of so(p, q)f.

A number of properties for the restriction of \u03bb\u22a5 to so(p, q)(x) and\nKill0 (M\nx\nH0 (x) will imply the needed conditions on H0 (x).\nClaim 1: \u03bb\u22a5\nx restricted to H0 (x) is injective. We recall that a Killing vector field\nis completely determined by its 1-jet at x; this is a consequence of the fact that\npseudo-Riemannian metrics are 1-rigid (see [7, 10]). If Z \u2208 H0 (x) is given, then\nZx = 0 and so it is completely determined by the values of [Z, V ]x for V a vector\nfield in a neighborhood of x. On the other hand [Z, X \u2217 ]x = 0 for X \u2208 so(p, q) and\nso [Z, V ]x = 0 whenever Vx \u2208 Tx O. We conclude that Z is completely determined\nby the values of [Z, V ]x for V such that Vx \u2208 Tx O\u22a5 . In other words, [Z, V ]x = 0\nfor every Vx \u2208 Tx O\u22a5 implies Z = 0.

Then, by Claim 2, there is some X \u2208 so(p, q) such that T = \u03bbx (\u03c1x (X)).\nFor every local vector field V such that Vx \u2208 Tx O\u22a5 we have:\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n[T, \u03bb\u22a5\nx (Z)](Vx ) = [\u03bbx (\u03c1x (X)), \u03bbx (Z)](Vx ) = [\u03c1x (X), [Z, V ]]x \u2212 [Z, [\u03c1x (X), V ]]x\n\n= [[\u03c1x (X), Z], V ]x = [[\u03c1x (X) + X \u2217 , Z], V ]x = [[b\n\u03c1x (X), Z], V ]x .\n\nSince the so(p, q)-module structure on H is defined by \u03c1bx and H0 (x) is a submodule\nof such structure, we have [b\n\u03c1x (X), Z] \u2208 H0 (x), and so the last formula proves that\n\u22a5\n[T, \u03bb\u22a5\n(Z)]\n=\n\u03bb\n([b\n\u03c1\n(X),\nZ]),\nthus showing the claim.\nx\nx\nx\nClaim 1 shows that H0 (x) is a Lie algebra isomorphic to its image in so(Tx O\u22a5 )\n\u22a5\nunder \u03bb\u22a5\nx .

This implies that H0 (x) is either 0 or isomorphic to\nso(p, q) as a Lie subalgebra of H.\nOn the other hand, for X \u2208 so(p, q) and Z \u2208 H0 (x), considering the definitions\nof the so(p, q)-module structures involved we have:\n\u22a5\n\u03bb\u22a5\n\u03c1x (X), Z]) = \u03bb\u22a5\nx (X * Z) = \u03bbx ([b\nx ([\u03c1x (X), Z])\n\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n= [\u03bb\u22a5\nx (\u03c1x (X)), \u03bbx (Z)] = X * \u03bbx (Z),\n\nwhere the second identity holds by the definition of \u03c1bx in terms of \u03c1x and bef 0 (p, q)-action.

Let S be as in Proposition 1.2. With the notation from Lemma 2.2,\none of the following conditions is satisfied for almost every x \u2208 S:\n(1) The radical rad(H) of H is Abelian and rad(H) = V(x).\n(2) H0 (x) 6= {0} and H is the sum of two simple ideals one of them being\nH0 (x) \u2295 V(x).\n(3) H0 (x) = {0} and H = G(x) \u2295 V(x) is isomorphic as a Lie algebra to either\nso(p, q + 1) or so(p + 1, q).\nProof. For this proof let us choose and fix x \u2208 S satisfying the conclusions of\nLemmas 1.7, 1.8, 2.1 and 2.2.\nNote that G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) is a Lie subalgebra with H0 (x) as an ideal because\n[G(x), H0 (x)] \u2282 H0 (x) as a consequence of Lemmas 1.7 and 2.2. Since G(x), H0 (x)\nare both isomorphic to so(p, q) if H0 (x) 6= {0}, we conclude that G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) is\nsemisimple. Furthermore, this implies that G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) is isomorphic to either\nso(p, q) or so(p, q) \u2295 so(p, q) according to whether H0 (x) is zero or not, respectively.\nChoose a Levi factor s of H that contains the Lie subalgebra G(x) \u2295 H0 (x).\nSince the so(p, q)-module structure of H is defined by the Lie subalgebra G(x) (see\nLemma 1.7), it follows that s is an so(p, q)-submodule of H. Let W be an so(p, q)submodule of H such that s = G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) \u2295 W . Since rad(H) is an ideal, this\ninduces the following decomposition of H as a direct sum of so(p, q)-submodules:\nH = G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) \u2295 W \u2295 rad(H).\nFrom this decomposition of so(p, q)-modules, as well as Lemmas 1.7 and 2.2, we\nconclude that one of the following holds:\n(a) s = G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) and rad(H) = V(x), or\n(b) rad(H) = {0} and so H is semisimple.\nLet us assume that case (a) holds. Then, the Lie brackets of H restricted to\n\u22272 V(x) define, by the Jacobi identity and Lemma 1.7, a homomorphism of so(p, q)modules \u22272 V(x) \u2192 V(x). This homomorphism is necessarily trivial since V(x)\nis n-dimensional, \u22272 V(x) \u2243 so(p, q) is irreducible and n \u2265 4. This shows that\nV(x) = rad(H) is Abelian and yields (1) from our statement.\nLet us now assume that case (b) holds, and write H = h1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 hk a direct product of simple ideals. Since each such ideal is invariant by G(x), it is an\nso(p, q)-submodule, and so it follows that k \u2264 3 since the decomposition of H from\nLemma 2.2 has at most 3 irreducible summands. Moreover, if k = 3 we conclude\nthat, after reindexing the ideals, we have V(x) = h1 and G(x) \u2295 H(x) = h2 \u00d7 h3 . In\nparticular, [G(x), V(x)] = {0} which implies that V(x) is a trivial so(p, q)-submodule\nand contradicts Lemma 2.2(3). Hence we can further assume that the number of\nsimple ideals of H is k \u2264 2.\nFirst suppose that H = h1 \u00d7 h2 , the direct product of two simple ideals. If\nH0 (x) = {0}, then the decomposition of H from Lemma 2.2 has two irreducible\nsummands and we can reindex the ideals h1 , h2 to assume that h1 = G(x) and\nh2 = V(x). But this implies that [G(x), V(x)] = {0}, a contradiction. Hence we\nconclude that H0 (x) 6= {0} in the current case. In particular, H is the direct sum of\nthree irreducible so(p, q)-submodules. Hence, after decomposing h1 , h2 as the direct\nsum of irreducible so(p, q)-submodules, and reindexing if necessary, we can assume\nthat h1 is an irreducible so(p, q)-submodule and that h2 = V1 \u2295 V2 , where V1 , V2 are\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n11\n\nirreducible so(p, q)-submodules. By comparing the decomposition H = h1 \u2295V1 \u2295V2 ,\nwith the one from Lemma 2.2, we conclude that V(x) is either one of h1 , V1 or V2 .\nIf V(x) = h1 , then [V(x), V(x)] \u2282 V(x) and an argument used above shows that\nV(x) is Abelian, which contradicts the simplicity of h1 . Hence, without loss of\ngenerality, we can assume that V(x) = V2 , and so that G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) = h1 \u2295 V1 . In\nparticular, since V1 is a subspace of both of the Lie algebras G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) = h1 \u2295 V1\nand h2 = V1 \u2295 V2 it follows that [V1 , V1 ] \u2282 V1 , thus showing that V1 itself is a Lie\nalgebra. But since [h1 , V1 ] = {0}, this implies that the right-hand side of the sum:\nG(x) \u2295 H0 (x) = h1 \u2295 V1\n\nis the decomposition into simple ideals. Since H0 (x) is an ideal of G(x)\u2295H0 (x), it is\neither h1 or V1 . If H0 (x) = h1 , then [H0 (x), V(x)] = {0}, which is in contradiction\nwith Claim 1 in the proof of Lemma 2.2 because evx (V(x)) = Tx O\u22a5 . Hence,\nH0 (x) = V1 and so H0 (x) \u2295 V(x) = h2 is a simple ideal of H, thus establishing\noption (2).\nFinally, let us assume that H is a simple Lie algebra. We will prove that in this\ncase (3) holds.\nLet us start by assuming that H0 (x) 6= {0}. Hence, from the above remarks, we\ncan write G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) = g1 \u2295 g2 , where g1 , g2 are ideals of G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) both\nisomorphic to so(p, q). Let V be a G(x) \u2295 H0 (x)-submodule of H such that:\nH = G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) \u2295 V.\n\nIn particular, V has dimension n. Moreover, V is necessarily a non-trivial g1 module, since otherwise g1 would be a proper ideal of H. Then, Lemma A.1 implies\nthat we can decompose V = V0 \u2295 V1 where V0 is a trivial g1 -module and V1 is an\nirreducible g1 -module. Note that this can be done so that V0 = {0}, except for\nthe cases given by so(3, 2) and so(3, 3) for which we can assume dim(V0 ) = 1 or\n2, respectively. In any case, this yields a decomposition of H into g1 -submodules\ngiven by:\nH = g1 \u2295 g2 \u2295 V0 \u2295 V1 .\nSince g1 and g2 commute with each other, then for every X \u2208 g2 the map adH (X)\ndefines a g1 -module homomorphism of V and so preserves its summands corresponding to given isomorphism classes for the g1 -module structure. Hence, V0\nand V1 are g2 -modules as well, and by Lemma A.1 it follows that V0 is a trivial\ng2 -module, because dim(V0 ) \u2264 2. As before, V1 is a non-trivial g2 -module, since\notherwise g2 would be a proper ideal of H.\nThe above shows that adH restricted to G(x) \u2295 H0 (x) \u2243 so(p, q) \u2295 so(p, q) leaves\ninvariant V1 and induces a representation:\n\u03c1 : so(p, q) \u2295 so(p, q) \u2192 sl(V1 ) \u2243 sl(k, R),\nfor some k \u2264 n, which is injective when restricted to each summand. Furthermore,\n\u03c1(so(p, q)\u2295{0}) and \u03c1({0}\u2295so(p, q)) centralize each other, from which the simplicity\nof so(p, q) implies that \u03c1(so(p, q) \u2295 {0}) \u2229 \u03c1({0} \u2295 so(p, q)) = {0}. In particular, \u03c1\nrealizes so(p, q) \u2295 so(p, q) as a Lie subalgebra of sl(k, R). Note that the codimension\nof so(p, q) \u2295 so(p, q) in sl(k, R) is k 2 \u2212 1 \u2212 n(n \u2212 1) \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nReplacing H with sl(k, R) and repeating these arguments, more than once if necessary, yields a non-trivial representation of so(p, q) with dimension strictly smaller\nthan the lower bound obtained in Lemma A.1 for irreducible non-trivial representations. This contradiction proves that H0 (x) = {0}.\n\n\f12\n\nGESTUR OLAFSSON AND RAUL QUIROGA-BARRANCO\n\nWith our assumption that H is simple we thus obtain H = G(x) \u2295 V(x). Hence,\nto conclude (3) it remains to show that H is isomorphic to either so(p, q + 1) or\nso(p + 1, q).\nRecall from the previous remarks that H = G(x) \u2295 V(x) is the decomposition\ninto irreducible so(p, q)-modules for an isomorphism G(x) \u2243 so(p, q) of Lie algebras.\nFurthermore, either V(x) \u2243 Rp,q as so(p, q)-modules or p = q = 4 and V(x) is\nisomorphic to one of C + or C \u2212 as so(4, 4)-modules. Let us first assume that the\nlatter case holds. Then, H is a 36-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Since there are no\nsimple complex Lie algebras of dimension 18, it follows that the complexification\nHC is a simple Lie algebra. Hence, a direct inspection of the simple complex\nLie algebras shows that HC is up to isomorphism either so(9, C) or sp(4, C). For\nHC \u2243 so(9, C) we conclude that H \u2243 so(5, 4) since it contains the Lie algebra\nG(x) \u2243 so(4, 4). For the case HC \u2243 sp(4, C) we obtain a non-trivial homomorphism\nso(8, C) \u2243 G(x)C \u2282 HC \u2243 sp(4, C), which yields an 8-dimensional so(8, C)-module,\nnon-trivial and so irreducible, with an invariant non-degenerate skew-symmetric\nform. The latter is a contradiction since every 8-dimensional irreducible so(8, C)module carries a unique (up to a constant) invariant non-degenerate symmetric\nform (see page 217 of [4]).\nHence, we can assume that V(x) \u2243 Rp,q as so(p, q)-modules. Also, since the\nso(p, q)-module structure on H is induced by G(x), we have [G(x), V(x)] \u2282 V(x).\nOn the other hand, the Lie brackets and the projection H \u2192 V(x) define a homomorphism of so(p, q)-modules \u22272 V(x) \u2192 V(x), which is thus trivial. This implies\nthat [V(x), V(x)] \u2282 G(x). Hence, there exists a linear isomorphism:\n\u03c6 : H = G(x) \u2295 V(x) \u2192 so(p, q) \u2295 Rp,q ,\n\nthat preserves the summands in that order, that restricts to an isomorphism of\nLie algebras G(x) \u2192 so(p, q) and that defines an isomorphism of so(p, q)-modules.\nMoreover, we also have proved the relations:\n[G(x), G(x)] \u2282 G(x),\n\n[G(x), V(x)] \u2282 V(x),\n\n[V(x), V(x)] \u2282 G(x).\n\nNote that the last relation defines an isomorphism T : \u22272 V(x) \u2192 G(x) of G(x)modules; otherwise, V(x) would be a non-trivial Abelian ideal of H. Recall the map\nTc (u \u2227 v) = c(hu, *ip,q v \u2212 hv, *ip,q u) from Lemma A.3. By Lemma A.3 and with\nrespect to the isomorphism \u03c6, the map T is of the form Tc for some c \u2208 R \\ {0},\nif n \u2265 5. Let us now assume that n \u2265 5. Hence, the Lie algebra structure on\nso(p, q) \u2295 Rp,q induced by \u03c6 is given by [*, *]c , as in Lemma A.8, for some c 6= 0,\nand so isomorphic to either so(p, q + 1) or so(p + 1, q). This shows that (3) holds\nwhen H is simple and (p, q) 6= (3, 1).\nFinally, consider the case (p, q) = (3, 1). Under such assumption, we have\ndim(H) = dim(G(x)) + dim(V(x)) = 10. Since there is no simple complex Lie\nalgebra of dimension 5 we conclude that HC is simple. Note that, up to isomorphism, so(5, C) is the only simple complex Lie algebra of complex dimension 10.\nFrom this we conclude that H is isomorphic to either so(4, 1) or so(3, 2) (the only\nnon-compact real forms of so(5, C) up to isomorphism) thus showing that (3) holds\nwhen H is simple and (p, q) = (3, 1).\n\u0003\n3. Proof of the Main Theorem\nIn this section we will assume the hypotheses of the Main Theorem. More precisely,\nwe assume that M is a connected analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifold which is\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n13\n\ncomplete weakly irreducible and has finite volume. We also assume that M admits\nf 0 (p, q)-action with a dense orbit for some integers p, q\nan analytic and isometric SO\nsuch that p, q \u2265 1 and n = p + q \u2265 5, or (p, q) = (3, 1).

Finally we are\nassuming that dim(M ) = n(n + 1)/2 and we will consider the three cases provided\nby Lemma 2.3. For this we will use the notation from Section 2. Our first goal is to\nrule out cases (1) and (2) of Lemma 2.3, which is done in the next two subsections.\nThen, we obtain in the third subsection the conclusions of the Main Theorem when\ncase (3) of Lemma 2.3 holds.\n3.1. Case 1: The radical of H is non-trivial. We are assuming that the conf. We will see that this\nclusion (1) of Lemma 2.3 is satisfied for some fixed x0 \u2208 M\nyields a contradiction with our assumptions on M .\nFirst note that H(x0 ) = G(x0 ) \u2295 V(x0 ) is a Lie subalgebra of H. This holds because V(x0 ) is Abelian and [G(x0 ), V(x0 )] \u2282 V(x0 ). Hence, G(x0 ) \u2295 V(x0 ) is isomorphic to the semidirect product Lie algebra so(p, q)\u22c9W , where W is an n-dimensional\nso(p, q)-module endowed with the Abelian Lie algebra structure. Choose a Lie algebra isomorphism \u03c8 : so(p, q) \u22c9 W \u2192 H(x0 ) that maps so(p, q) onto G(x0 ) and W\nonto V(x0 ).\nf 0 (p, q) \u22c9 W the Lie group structure on SO\nf 0 (p, q) \u00d7 W with\nLet us denote with SO\nthe semidirect product given by:\n(A, v) * (B, w) = (AB, B \u22121 v + w),\n\nf 0 (p, q) on W induced by that\nwhere we are considering the representation of SO\nf 0 (p, q) \u22c9 W is so(p, q) \u22c9 W .

Case 2: H0 (x0 ) 6= {0} and H is the sum of two simple ideals. We now\nf.\nassume that the conclusion (2) of Lemma 2.3 is satisfied for some fixed x0 \u2208 M\nAs in the previous case, we will rule out this possibility.\nIn this case, there exist simple Lie algebras h1 , h2 and an isomorphism of Lie\nalgebras \u03c8 : h1 \u00d7h2 \u2192 H so that \u03c8(h2 ) = H0 (x0 )\u2295V(x0 ). Let H1 and H2 be simply\nconnected Lie groups with Lie algebras h1 and h2 , respectively.

We claim that we also have dfe (h1 ) = Tx0 O and\ndfe (h2 ) = Tx0 O\u22a5 . The latter follows from our choice of \u03c8 and Lemma 2.2. To\nprove the former, first note that both \u03c8(h1 ) and G(x0 ) are complementary so(p, q)modules to H0 (x0 ) \u2295 V(x0 ) in H, and so they are isomorphic as so(p, q)-modules.\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n15\n\nf = Tx0 O \u2295 Tx0 O\u22a5 necessarHence, by Lemma 2.2 the evaluation evx0 : H \u2192 Tx0 M\nily maps \u03c8(h1 ) onto Tx0 O since Tx0 O \u2243 G(x0 ) 6\u2243 Tx0 O\u22a5 as so(p, q)-modules.

Since H2 is simply connected\nand \u03c8 \u22121 (H0 (x0 )) is simple, it follows that H is a closed subgroup of H2 (see Exercise D.4(ii), Chapter II from [12]). Hence, the map:\nf,\nfb : H1 \u00d7 H\\H2 \u2192 M\n\n(h1 , Hh2 ) 7\u2192 x0 (h1 , h2 ),\n\nis a well-defined (H1 \u00d7 H2 )-equivariant analytic map of manifolds.

There is an isomorphism \u03c8 : so(p, q) \u2295 Rp,q \u2192 H = G(x0 ) \u2295 V(x0 ) of\nLie algebras that preserves the summands in that order, where the domain has the\nLie algebra structure given by [*, *]c for some c 6= 0 as defined in Lemma A.8. In\nparticular, \u03c8 is an isomorphism of so(p, q)-modules as well.\n\nProof. The result follows from the arguments in the second to last paragraph in\nthe proof of Lemma 2.3 when V(x0 ) \u2243 Rp,q as so(p, q)-modules and n \u2265 5. Hence,\nby Lemma 2.1 we can assume that either (p, q) = (3, 1) or (p, q) = (4, 4) in the rest\nof the proof.\nBy Lemma 2.3 there is an isomorphism \u03c8 : h \u2192 H, for h = so(V ) where V\nis either R4,1 or R3,2 for (p, q) = (3, 1), and it is R5,4 for (p, q) = (4, 4). The\nrestriction of this homomorphism to \u03c8 \u22121 (G(x0 )) yields a representation of G(x0 ) \u2243\nso(p, q) on the (n + 1)-dimensional space V . By the description of the irreducible\nrepresentations of so(3, 1) from previous sections we know that there do not exist 5dimensional irreducible representations of so(3, 1). In particular, there is a line L \u2282\nV that is a G(x0 )-submodule for the case (p, q) = (3, 1). On the other hand, since\nso(4, 4) is split and using Weyl's dimension formula we find that so(4, 4) does not\nadmit 9-dimensional irreducible representations. Hence, for the case (p, q) = (4, 4)\nwe similarly conclude the existence of a line L \u2282 V which is a G(x0 )-submodule.\nLet us now consider our two remaining cases (p, q) \u2208 {(3, 1), (4, 4)} together. If\nL as above is a null line, then \u03c8 \u22121 (G(x0 )) lies in the Lie algebra s of the stabilizer\nof some point in either of the pseudo-conformal spaces C p,q\u22121 or C p\u22121,q . We recall\nthat C r,s is the projectivization of the null cone of Rr+1,s+1 , is homogeneous under\nO(r + 1, s + 1) and has dimension r + s (see [1] for further details). In particular, s\nhas dimension n(n \u2212 1)/2 + 1. This yields \u03c8 \u22121 (G(x0 )) ( s ( h, which contradicts\nTheorem A.5. We conclude that L is a non-null line.\nThis yields an orthogonal decomposition V = L \u2295 L\u22a5 into non-degenerate subspaces which is clearly a decomposition into G(x0 )-submodules. Hence, \u03c8 induces\nan isomorphism so(L\u22a5 ) \u2192 G(x0 ) and a rank argument shows that L\u22a5 has signature (p, q). In particular, so(L\u22a5 ) \u2243 so(p, q) as Lie algebras under \u03c8.

In particular, there exist X0 \u2208 so(p, q) such\nthat X = \u03c1x0 (X0 ) + X0\u2217 , where \u03c1x0 is the homomorphism from Proposition 1.2 and\nf induced by X0 through the left SO\nf 0 (p, q)-action. Then,\nX0\u2217 is the vector field on M\nthe following proves the required invariance:\ng([X, Y ], Z) = gx0 ([X, Y ]x0 , Zx0 ) = g([X, Y ], Z)|x0\n\n= g([\u03c1x0 (X0 ) + X0\u2217 , Y ], Z)|x0 = g([\u03c1x0 (X0 ), Y ], Z)|x0\n= \u03c1x0 (X0 )(g(Y, Z))|x0 \u2212 g(Y, [\u03c1x0 (X0 ), Z])|x0\n\n= \u2212g(Y, [\u03c1x0 (X0 ), Z])|x0 = \u2212g(Y, [\u03c1x0 (X0 ) + X0\u2217 , Z])|x0\n= \u2212g(Y, [X, Z])|x0 = \u2212g(Y, [X, Z]).\n\nWe have used in lines 2 and 4 that H centralizes X0\u2217 . To obtain the third line we\nused that \u03c1x0 (X0 ) is a Killing field for the metric g. And the first identity in line\n\u0003\n4 uses the fact that \u03c1x0 (X0 ) vanishes at x0 .\nFrom the previous result and Lemma A.9, for n \u2265 5 we can rescale the metric\nf satisfies\nalong the bundles T O and T O\u22a5 in M so that the new metric gb on M\n(dfI )\u2217 (b\ngx0 ) = K, the Killing form on h.\nLet us now consider the case (p, q) = (3, 1). From the hypotheses of the Main\nf for every X \u2208 su(2), Y \u2208 Jsu(2)\nTheorem, we are now assuming that X \u2217 \u22a5 Y \u2217 in M\nf\nand the left SL(2, C)-action on M . By Proposition 1.2 and Lemma 1.7, we have\n\u03c1bx0 (X)x0 = Xx\u22170 and so \u03c1bx0 (X)x0 \u22a5 \u03c1bx0 (Y )x0 , for every X \u2208 su(2) and Y \u2208 Jsu(2).\nHence, for the compact real form U = \u03c1bx0 (su(2)) of G(x0 ) we have Xx0 \u22a5 Yx0 when\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n17\n\nX \u2208 U and Y \u2208 JU. By the definition of g and the expression for dfI given above, it\nfollows that for the metric g restricted to so(3, 1) \u2243 sl(2, C)R we have g(X, Y ) = 0\nfor every X \u2208 \u03c8 \u22121 (U) and Y \u2208 J\u03c8 \u22121 (U). By the remarks that follow Lemma A.9\nf along T O and\nwe conclude that in this case we can also rescale the metric on M\nT O\u22a5 to obtain a new metric b\ng such that (dfI )\u2217 (b\ngx0 ) = K, the Killing form of h.\nNote that, for both cases n \u2265 5 and (p, q) = (3, 1), since the elements of H\nf, b\npreserve the decomposition T M = T O \u2295 T O\u22a5 , then H \u2282 Kill(M\ng). In other\nwords, the elements of H are Killing vector fields for the metric b\ng rescaled as above.\nf 0 (p, q)In particular, gb is invariant under the right H-action. Similarly, the left SO\nf, from the hypotheses of the Main Theorem, preserves the rescaled\naction on M\nmetric b\ng. Also note that the metric b\ng is the lift of a correspondingly rescaled metric\ng in M .\nb\nConsider the bi-invariant metric on H induced by the Killing form K, which we\nwill denote with the same symbol. The previous discussion implies that the local\nf, b\ndiffeomorphism f : (H, K) \u2192 (M\ng) is a local isometry. Then, by Corollary 29 in\nf\npage 202 of [13], the completeness of (H, K) and the simple connectedness of M\nimply that f is an isometry.\nHence, from the previous discussion we obtain the following result.\nLemma 3.3. Let M be as in the statement of the Main Theorem. If dim(M ) =\nf 0 (p, q + 1) or SO\nf 0 (p + 1, q), there exists an analytic\nn(n + 1)/2, then for H either SO\nf and an analytic isometric right H-action on M\nf such\ndiffeomorphism f : H \u2192 M\nthat:\nf, the left SO\nf 0 (p, q)-action and the right H-action commute with each\n(1) on M\nother,\n(2) f is H-equivariant for the right H-action on its domain,\n(3) for a pseudo-Riemannian metric gb in M obtained by rescaling the original\nf, b\none on the summands of T M = T O \u2295 T O\u22a5 , the map f : (H, K) \u2192 (M\ng)\nis an isometry where K is the bi-invariant metric on H induced from the\nKilling form of its Lie algebra.\nIf we consider H endowed with the bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric K\ninduced by the Killing form of its Lie algebra, then Lemma 3.3 allows to consider\n(H, K) as the isometric universal covering space of (M, gb). We will use this identification in the rest of the arguments.\nThe isometry group Iso(H) for the pseudo-Riemannian manifold (H, K) has\nfinitely many connected components (see for example Section 4 of [15]). Furthermore, the connected component of the identity is given as Iso0 (H) = L(H)R(H),\nthe subgroup generated by L(H) and R(H), the left and right translations, respectively.\nf 0 (p, q) \u2192 Iso0 (H) be the homomorphism induced by isometric left\nLet \u03c1 : SO\nf 0 (p, q)-action on H.

In particular, \u03c12 (SO\nso (being connected) it is trivial. We conclude that \u03c1 = L\u03c11 which implies that the\n\n\f18\n\nGESTUR OLAFSSON AND RAUL QUIROGA-BARRANCO\n\nf 0 (p, q)-action on H is induced by the homomorphism \u03c11 : SO\nf 0 (p, q) \u2192 H and\nSO\nthe left action of H on itself. Note that \u03c11 is necessarily non-trivial.\nBy Lemma 3.3, we have \u03c01 (M ) \u2282 Iso(H), and from the above remarks \u03931 =\n\u03c01 (M ) \u2229 Iso0 (H) is a finite index subgroup of \u03c01 (M ). In particular, every \u03b3 \u2208 \u03931\ncan be written as \u03b3 = Lh1 \u25e6 Rh2 for some h1 , h2 \u2208 H.\nf 0 (p, q)-action on H is the lift of an action\nOn the other hand, since the left SO\non M , it follows that it commutes with the \u03931 -action. Applying this property to\nf 0 (p, q),\n\u03b3 = Lh1 \u25e6 Rh2 we conclude that Lh1 \u25e6 L\u03c11 (g) = L\u03c11 (g) \u25e6 Lh1 , for every g \u2208 SO\nf 0 (p, q)) in H. By\nwhich implies \u03931 \u2282 L(Z)R(H), where Z is the centralizer of \u03c11 (SO\nLemma A.6, the center of Z(H) has finite index in Z, which implies that R(H) has\nfinite index in L(Z)R(H). In particular, \u0393 = \u03931 \u2229 R(H) is a finite index subgroup\nof \u03931 , and so has finite index in \u03c01 (M ) as well.\nHence, the natural identification R(H) = H realizes \u0393 as a discrete subgroup of\nH such that H/\u0393 is a finite covering space of M . Furthermore, if \u03c6 : H/\u0393 \u2192 M is\nf 0 (p, q)-action on H/\u0393 given by\nthe corresponding covering map, and for the left SO\nf\nthe homomorphism \u03c11 : SO0 (p, q) \u2192 H, then the above constructions show that \u03c6\nf 0 (p, q)-equivariant. We also note that \u03c6 is a local isometry for the metric b\nis SO\ng\non M considered in Lemma 3.3.\nTo complete the proof of the Main Theorem it only remains to show that \u0393 is a\nlattice in H. For this it is enough to prove that M has finite volume in the metric\ng. The following result provides proofs of these facts since we are assuming that M\nb\nhas finite volume in its original metric.\nLemma 3.4. Let us denote with vol and volgb the volume elements on M for the\noriginal metric on M and the rescaled metric b\ng, respectively. Then, there is some\nconstant C > 0 such that volgb = Cvol.\nProof. Clearly, it suffices to verify this locally, so we consider some coordinates\n(x1 , . . . , xm ) of M in a neighborhood U of a given point such that (x1 , . . . , xr )\ndefines a set of coordinates of the leaves of the foliation O in such neighborhood.\nFor the original metric g on M , consider as above the orthogonal bundle T O\u22a5 and\na set of 1-forms \u03b81 , . . . \u03b8m\u2212r that define a basis for its dual (T O\u22a5 )\u2217 at every point\nin U . Hence, in U the metric g has an expression of the form:\ng=\n\nr\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nhij dxi \u2297 dxj +\n\nm\u2212r\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nkij \u03b8i \u2297 \u03b8j .\n\nFrom this and the definition of the volume element as an m-form, its is easy to see\nthat:\nq\nvol = | det(hij ) det(kij )|dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxr \u2227 \u03b81 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03b8m\u2212r .\nOn the other hand, the metric b\ng is obtained by rescaling g along the bundles T O\nand T O\u22a5 , and so it has an expression of the form:\ng=\nb\n\nr\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nc1 hij dxi \u2297 dxj +\n\nm\u2212r\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nc2 kij \u03b8i \u2297 \u03b8j ,\n\n\fON LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS WITH ISOMETRIC SO0 (p, q)-ACTIONS\n\n19\n\nfor some constants c1 , c2 6= 0.

Facts on the Lie algebra so(p, q)\nIn this appendix we collect some facts about the pairs (so(p + 1, q), so(p, q)) and\n(so(p, q + 1), so(p, q)). We now describe some low-dimensional non-trivial so(p, q)modules. The following result is an easy consequence of well known facts of classical\nLie groups (see [11, 14]). As mentioned in the introduction we denote with m(g)\nthe lowest dimension of a non-trivial g-module with an invariant non-degenerate\nsymmetric bilinear form.\nLemma A.1. Let p, q \u2265 1, n = p + q \u2265 4 such that (p, q) 6= (2, 2). Then,\nm(so(p, q)) = n, i.e. there is no non-trivial so(p, q)-module with dimension < n\nand carrying an invariant inner product. Moreover, the only non-trivial irreducible\nso(p, q)-module of dimension \u2264 n is Rp,q , except for the Lie algebras so(3, 1),\nso(3, 2), so(3, 3) and so(4, 4). For the latter, there also exist the following irreducible modules:\n\u2022 C2R corresponding to so(3, 1) \u2243 sl(2, C)R .\n\u2022 R4 corresponding to so(3, 2) \u2243 sp(2, R).\n\u2022 R4 and R4\u2217 corresponding to so(3, 3) \u2243 sl(4, R).\n\u2022 so(4, 4)-invariant real forms of the half spin representations of so(8, C), both\n8-dimensional.\nRemark A.2. We note that the previous statement is not correct in lower dimensions. We have that so(1, 1) is abelian, so every irreducible module is onedimensional. In fact R1,1 = R2 decomposes into irreducible submodules where\nt \u2208 R \u2243 so(1, 1) acts by multiplication by et respectively e\u2212t .\nThe Lie algebra so(2, 2) \u2243 sl(2, R) \u00d7 sl(2, R) is not simple and acts on R2 . But\nthere is again no non-trivial invariant symmetric bilinear form on R2 . The lowest\ndimensional so(2, 2)-module with a non-trivial invariant form is R2,1 where one of\nthe factors carries the canonical so(2, 1) action, and the other factor acts trivially,\nthus reducing this to the case of so(2, 1). Hence we have m(so(2, 2)) = 3.\nThe following statement is an easy to prove exercise.\nLemma A.3. Let p, q \u2265 1 and n = p + q \u2265 3. Then, for every c \u2208 R, the map\nTc : \u22272 Rp,q \u2192 so(p, q) given by:\np,q\n\nTc (u \u2227 v) = c hu, *ip,q v \u2212 c hv, *ip,q u,\n\nfor every u, v \u2208 R , is a well defined homomorphism of so(p, q)-modules. Also,\nTc is an isomorphism of so(p, q)-modules if and only if c 6= 0. If n 6= 4, then these\nmaps exhaust all the so(p, q)-module homomorphisms \u22272 Rp,q \u2192 so(p, q).\nRemark A.4. The last conclusion fails for so(2, 2) \u2243 so(2, 1) \u00d7 so(2, 1) as it is not\nsimple. It also fails for so(3, 1) \u2243 sl(2, C), since the complex structure of sl(2, C)\ndefines an isomorphism which is not multiplication by a real scalar.\nNext we prove the maximality of so(p, q) in both so(p, q + 1) and so(p + 1, q).\n\n\f20\n\nGESTUR OLAFSSON AND RAUL QUIROGA-BARRANCO\n\nTheorem A.5. Assume that p, q \u2265 1 and n = p + q \u2265 3, and let g = so(p + 1, q)\nor g = so(p, q + 1). Suppose that \u03c1 : so(p, q) \u0592\u2192 g is an injective Lie algebra\nhomomorphism and let h = \u03c1(so(p, q)). If g, h 6\u2243 so(2, 1) \u00d7 so(2, 1), then h is a\nmaximal subalgebra of g.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 1.2 of [8] for n big and a case by case calculation\nfor the other cases. We give here a simple proof for completeness. The map \u03b8(X) =\n\u2212X t is a Cartan involution on g. As all Cartan involutions are conjugate and every\nCartan involution on h extends to a Cartan involution on g we can assume that\n\u03b8(h) = h. Then the form \u03b2(X, Y ) = Tr(XY ) is non-degenerate on g and h. Let\nV be the \u03b2-orthogonal complement of h. Hence V is an n-dimensional h-module\nwhich is necessarily non-trivial since otherwise h is an ideal. Furthermore, \u03b2|V \u00d7V is\nnon-degenerate and h-invariant. It follows by Lemma A.1 that V is an irreducible\nh-module if n \u2265 4 and (p, q) 6= (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3). Hence h is maximal in those\ncases.\nLet us now assume that h = so(2, 1) \u2243 sl(2, R), g = so(3, 1) and V is not\nirreducible. Thus V = V1 \u2295V2 with V1 \u2243 R and V2 \u2243 R2 where the representation on\nV1 is trivial and the representation on V2 is isomorphic to the natural representation\nof sl(2, R). But then it follows that V2 is invariant under \u03b8 and hence \u03b2|V2 \u00d7V2 is an\nh-invariant non-degenerate form, contradicting the fact that there is no such form\non R2 . The remaining cases (p, q) \u2208 {(3, 2), (3, 3)} can be considered similarly using\nLemma A.1.\n\u0003\nLemma A.6. Suppose that G is a connected Lie group locally isomorphic to either\nf 0 (p, q + 1) or SO\nf 0 (p + 1, q), where p, q \u2265 1 and n = p + q \u2265 3, and consider\nSO\nf\n\u03c1 : SO0 (p, q) \u2192 G a non-trivial homomorphism of Lie groups. Assume that so(p, q),\nso(p, q + 1) and so(p + 1, q) satisfy the same conditions as in Theorem A.5. Then,\nf 0 (p, q))) of \u03c1(SO\nf 0 (p, q)) in G contains Z(G) (the center of\nthe centralizer ZG (\u03c1(SO\nG) as a finite index subgroup.\nf 0 (p, q)) and write h for the Lie algebra of H. Then, clearly\nProof. Write H = \u03c1(SO\nZ(G) \u2286 ZG (H). The Lie algebra of ZG (H) is\nzg (h) = {X \u2208 g | [X, Y ] = 0 for all Y \u2208 h} .\n\nClearly zg (h) + h is a Lie algebra containing h. By Theorem A.5 we conclude that\nzg (h) \u2282 h. As h is simple, it follows that zg (h) = {0} and so ZG (H) is discrete.\nFinally, it follows easily from [18], Lemma 1.1.3.7, that ZG (H) is contained in any\nmaximal compact subgroup of G and hence that it is finite.\n\u0003\nRemark A.7. If p = q = 1 then h is abelian, hence H \u2286 ZG (H). On the other\nhand Theorem A.5 shows that ZG (H)/H is finite. For so(2, 1) \u2282 so(2, 1) \u00d7 so(2, 1)\nthe statement remains true if so(2, 1) is embedded diagonally, but clearly not if\nso(2, 1) \u2243 so(2, 1) is one of the ideals.\nWe now provide an elementary but useful description of the Lie algebra structures\nof so(p, q + 1) and so(p + 1, q) in terms of so(p, q)-modules. In the next result\nso(p, q) \u22c9 Rp,q is considered with the usual semidirect product Lie algebra structure\ncoming from the fact that Rp,q is an so(p, q)-module.
