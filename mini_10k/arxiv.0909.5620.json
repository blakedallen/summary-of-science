Part of the appeal doubtless lies in the exquisite experimental control\nthat may be exercised over the parameters of a system in\nwhich many of the complicating factors familiar from the\nsolid state (disorder, phonons, etc.) are absent. Certain\nintrinsic aspects of ultracold atomic gases \u2013 not dependent on the specifics of the experimental setting \u2013 are\nqualitatively novel, however, and without antecedent in\nthe study of condensed matter. In this latter category we\nmay place the possibility of spontaneous ordering of the\nspin degrees of freedom in a Bose gas. Indeed, prior to the\n'ultracold revolution' the only Bose superfluid that could\nbe studied in the laboratory was 4 He, which has zero spin.\nWith the advent of optical trapping of Bose condensates\nof alkali atoms, which allows for a fully rotationally invariant setting, the experimental study of spin ordering\nwithin a hyperfine multiplet came within reach1,2 .\nThe earliest theoretical works motivated by these developments explored possible ordered phases using a\nmean field description, in both the spin 1 and spin 2 hyperfine multiplets3\u20136 . In this description the concept of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking plays a central role. Up\nuntil very recently, however, there were no experiments\nin which this spontaneous ordering was apparent. The\nreason for this is that the simplest experimental protocol\nfor the investigation of the hyperfine state of the gas is to\napply a magnetic field gradient to split a gas cloud into\ndifferent components in a Stern-Gerlach experiment1,2 .\nThe different components are subsequently imaged to determine their (relative) occupancies. This technique naturally imposes a quantization axis, and any information\nconcerning the coherence between different hyperfine levels is lost. Thus magnetic alignment in the plane perpendicular to this axis, which depends on the relative phase\nof these different levels, cannot be observed.\nThe characterization of magnetic ordering in atomic\ngases has taken a leap forward in the last few years thanks\nto the work of the Berkeley group, who demonstrated in\nsitu dispersive imaging of the transverse magnetization of\n\na gas of 87 Rb in the spin 1 multiplet7 , and subsequently\nemployed this technique to investigate a number of fascinating aspects of this system, including the dynamics\nof spontanteous symmetry breaking, defect production,\nand the role played by magnetic dipole forces8\u201310 .\nThe above developments illustrate two important\nneeds. Firstly, imaging of the spin order was necessary\nto bring much of this new physics out into the open. Secondly, the nonequilibrium character of most experiments\nrequires that the mean field theory of equilibrium ordered\nstates be supplemented with a dynamical description of\nthe relevant order parameters.\nIt is our hope that the next few years will see the development of imaging techniques capable of detecting some\nof the spin orders to be discussed in Section III, of which\nan average magnetization is only the simplest. The aim\nof this work is to address the second need: uncovering\nthe low energy description of the order parameter. For\nthe case of the Bose ferromagnet, which is appropriate to\nthe spin 1 87 Rb system, this description was provided in\nan earlier paper11 . In this work we will focus instead on\nstates with vanishing average magnetization. For reasons\nthat will be become clear in the following sections these\ncases are qualitatively different.\nB.\n\nLow energy descriptions\n\nIn an ordered phase of matter we expect that the low\nenergy degrees of freedom consist of variations of the order parameter on some manifold of symmetry broken\nstates (Goldstone modes), together with any conserved\nquantities. In our earlier work on the Bose ferromagnet11\nthe degrees of freedom were the local magnetic moment\nm and the superfluid velocity v. In the long wavelength\nlimit these were found to obey the coupled equations\nDm\n~2\n\u2212\nm \u00d7 \u22072 m = 0\nDt\n2m\n\u2207 * v = 0,\n\n\u2207\u00d7v =\n\n~s\n\u000fabc ma \u2207mb \u00d7 \u2207mc\n2m\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nD\n\u2202\nwhere Dt\n= \u2202t\n+v*\u2207 is the convective derivative. Eq. (1)\nis a modified Landau-Lifshitz equation and gives rise\nto quadratically dispersing spinwaves when linearized on\naround a solution m = const..\n\n\f2\nThe quadratic dispersion is a consequence of the two\ntransverse deviations of the order parameter being canonically conjugate. For the phases with vanishing average\nmagnetization that are the focus of this work, the conjugate variables involve deviations from the order parameter manifold. This results in linearly dispersing Goldstone modes. The situation is analogous to the case of\nspin waves in an antiferromagnet, where the conjugate\nvariables are the difference in magnetization on neighboring sites \u2013 the N\u00e9el order parameter \u2013 and the sum.\nIt also follows from the vanishing of the average magnetization that the order parameter dynamics and superfluid flow are decoupled except for a global topological\nconstraint. Again, this is quite different from the case of\nthe ferromagnet, where the two are coupled together in\nthe equations of motion. It follows that we can write a\nLagrangian for the spin degrees of freedom only. This Lagrangian is expressed in terms of a rotation matrix R that\nspecifies the local orientation of the spin state relative to\nsome reference state. By expressing the matrix elements\nof R in terms of an orthonormal triad Rab = (eb )a , with\nea * eb = \u03b4ab , the spin Lagrangian may be written\nLspin\n\n3\ni\n1 X h \u0303\n2\n2\n=\nIa (\u2202t ea ) \u2212 g\u0303a (\u2207ea )\n2 a=1\n\n(3)\n\nHere I \u0303a are g\u0303a are some constants to be specified later,\nwhich depend on the ordered phase in question. The Lagrangian Eq. (3) is the main result of this paper. The\nonly other phase for which the spin Lagrangian was previously obtained is the polar phase of the spin 1 gas, to\nbe discussed below, in which I \u0303a = g\u0303a = 0, a = 2, 3, giving\nthe familiar O(3) model12 .\nC.\n\nOutline of this paper\n\nThe structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section II we review the basic description of\na spinor condensate, and in particular the structure of\nthe interaction Hamiltonian. Section III describes in detail the ground state manifolds of the different phases\nof spinor condensates, beginning with the simplest nontrivial case, spin 1, before introducing the Majorana (or\nstellar) representation that is very useful in visualizing\nspin states. The global structure and local geometry\nof the order parameter manifolds are then introduced,\nas well as a parametrization for the dynamical variables\nconjugate to the order parameter. After this the derivation of the low energy Lagrangian is a relatively simple\nmatter, and is described in Section IV along with the\nderivation of the equations of motion. We have tried to\nkeep the presentation pedagogical throughout, though at\nvarious points there are parenthetical technical comments\nthat the casual reader should feel free to ignore.\nIn a related work, Barnett et al.13 have derived the full\nequations of motion of a spinor condensate in terms of the\nMajorana representation and applied a group-theoretical\n\nanalysis to the determination of all normal modes about\nan ordered ground state. We pursue a complimentary\ngoal of obtaining the full nonlinear Lagrangian for the\nGoldstone modes only.\nII.\n\nBASICS OF SPINOR BOSE CONDENSATES\nA.\n\nLagrangian\n\nOne could take the point of view that the description of the dynamics of a dilute spinor gas is no different from its spinless counterpart, being governed by\nthe time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with Lagrangian density\nL = i\u03c6\u2020 \u2202t \u03c6 \u2212 H(\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6)\n\n(4)\n\n(we set ~ = m = 1 from now on). For a spin s gas \u03c6 is\na 2s + 1 component spinor and the Hamiltonian density\nhas the form\nH(\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6) =\n\n1\n\u2207\u03c6\u2020 \u2207\u03c6 + Hint (\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6),\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the first term is the kinetic energy. The interaction\npart Hint (\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6) is quartic in \u03c6 and its form will be given\nbelow for s = 1 and 2. We will not discuss the influence\nof the trapping potential, save to assume that it preserves\nrotational symmetry. For stationary solutions of the form\n\u03c6(r, t) = e\u2212i\u03bct \u03c6(r) the time-dependent description reduces to the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii theory,\nwith \u03bc the Rchemical potential. Instead of treating the\naction S = drdt L classically, we can interpret it as the\nquantum action in a coherent state path integral. Little\nthat we will have to say will depend upon this distinction.\nIn fact this superficial similarity between the spinless\nand spinful problems is quite misleading. The ground\nstate in a uniform system corresponds to some constant\n\u03c6. In the spinless case this fixes \u03c6 up to a phase once\nthe density \u03c1 = \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 is specified. But in the spinful case\nwe still have to find the correct 'direction' of \u03c6 in the\ncomplex 2s + 1 dimensional spinor space, determined by\nminimizing the interaction Hamiltonian Hint (\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6). The\ninteractions will be assumed to respect rotational symmetry, so this minimum is only unique up to rotation\n(specified by the three Euler angles, say). Choosing this\nrotation \u2013 starting from some arbitrary reference state\n\u2013 specifies the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in the ground state. The slow variation of this\nrotation in space and time constitutes the low energy\ndynamics of the system, the description of which is the\nsubject of this work. To characterize these low energy\nmanifolds we must first specify the form of Hint .\nB.\n\nInteraction Hamiltonian\n\nThe structure of Hint has been discussed in many\nworks, starting with the first papers treating spinor Bose\n\n\f3\ncondensates. We will therefore keep the following discussion relatively brief. Low energy scattering between\na pair of bosons occurs in the s-wave channel only, and\ncan be treated as a \u03b4-function interaction, characterized\nby a set of interaction constants gS , S = 0, 2, . . . 2s for a\npair of bosons with total spin S. Bose symmetry dictates\nthat the interaction vanishes for odd total spin.\nFor spin 1, the resulting interaction may be presented\nin the form3,4\nc0 \u2020 \u00012 c2 \u0010 \u2020 (1) \u00112\n\u03c6 S \u03c6\n\u03c6 \u03c6 +\nHint =\n(6)\n2\n2\nwhere S (s) are the spin s angular momentum matrices.\nEq. (6) is the sum of a density-density and a spin-spin\ninteraction. For spin 2 we have5,14\nc0 \u2020 \u00012 c1 \u0010 \u2020 (2) \u00112 c2\n2\n(7)\n\u03c6 S \u03c6 +\n\u03c6*\u03c6\n\u03c6 \u03c6 +\n2\n2\n10\nPs\ns+m\nHere \u03c6 * \u03c6 = m=\u2212s (\u22121)\n\u03c6m \u03c6\u2212m is a scalar representing the amplitude of singlet pairs of spin s (Eq. (6)\ncan be expressed using this operation instead of the\nspin-spin interaction. In the spin 2 case both terms\nare needed). Our use of c2 for two different quantities\nmatches the notation of the works cited above, where one\nmay find explicit expressions for ci i = 0, 1, 2 in terms the\nconstants gS defined above.\nIn the spin 1 case it is fairly clear how to minimize\nEq. (6) at fixed density. For the spin 2 case things are less\nobvious. In the next section we will discuss a method of\nparametrizing the spinor \u03c6 to make this operation transparent.\nHint =\n\nIII.\n\nIDENTIFYING THE SPIN DEGREES OF\nFREEDOM\n\nIn this section we will introduce the Majorana (or stellar ) representation of spin states. This provides a vivid\nway to picture spin ordering in higher spin condensates in\nwhich rotational symmetry is manifest. None of the calculations of Section IV depend upon this representation;\nits use is rather in providing a concrete way to picture\nthe ground state manifold.\nBefore beginning it is worth setting the scene with a\nmore pedestrian discussion of the spin 1 case3,4 .\n\nrelationship to the usual components \u03c6m m = \u22121, 0, 1 is\n1\n\u03c6x = \u221a (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c6\u22121 )\n2\ni\n\u03c6y = \u221a (\u03c61 + \u03c6\u22121 )\n2\n\u03c6z = \u03c60\n\nIn this\n\u0010 basis\n\u0011 the angular momentum matrices take the\n(1)\nform Si\n= \u2212i\u000fijk .Then we have\njk\n\n\u03c6\u2020 S (1) \u03c6 = 2a \u00d7 b\nFor c2 < 0 the interaction energy is minimized for a\nand b perpendicular and equal in magnitude. This state\nis termed ferromagnetic as it corresponds to maximal\npolarization of the spin. The resulting order parameter\nmanifold corresponds to the set of all configuration of a\npair of orthogonal vectors, and is thus identified with the\ngroup of rotations SO(3)\nFor c2 > 0 a and b are aligned. The resulting polar\nstate (the name originates from an analogous state in\nsuperfluid 3 He) can therefore be written as\n\u03c6n,\u03b8 = ei\u03b8 n\n\n(s)\n\nPhases of the spin 1 gas\n\nLet us minimize Eq. (6) with a spinor \u03c6 normalized to\nunity (thus we are adopting units in which the density\n\u03c1 = 1). This is a matter of minimizing (maximizing)\n\u03c6\u2020 S (1) \u03c6 for c2 > 0 (c2 < 0). One way to make the\nresulting states more clear is to write the complex spinor\n\u03c6 = a + ib where a and b are two real vectors satisfying\na2 + b2 = 1, and to work in cartesian components. The\n\n(9)\n\nfor n a real unit vector. Note that this parametrization\nhas some redundancy in that the points (\u03b8 + \u03c0, \u2212n) and\n(\u03b8, n) are identified. The resulting manifold is known as\nthe mapping torus of the antipodal map of the sphere S 2 .\nThe global topology of the above ferromagnetic and\npolar order parameter manifolds naturally determines\nthe character of the topological defects in the ordered\nphases, and certain features of the ordering transitions,\nsome of which have already been discussed in the literature15 . This is not the focus of the present work and\ntopology will not be further discussed, even though the\ndefect physics of the higher spin condensates promises to\nbe highly non-trivial16,17 .\nThe polar state has \u03c6\u2020n,\u03b8 S (1) \u03c6n,\u03b8 = 0. Nevertheless\nthe above discussion makes it clear that polar ordering\ninvolves a choice of axis: the spinor \u03c6n,\u03b8 is the m = 0\nstate with respect to the axis n.

Nematic ordering in solid state magnetic systems has been\nthe subject of much experimental and theoretical work\nin recent years, with a good deal of uncertainty still remaining. The observation of the polar state in the spin\n1 Bose gas would therefore be an important milestone.\nSearching for higher spin order parameters as the spin\nof the gas particles increases becomes arduous. We now\nturn to a more convenient representation of the spin order.\n\nB.\n\nMajorana (stellar) representation\n\nThe representation of a general spin s state that\n(sometimes) bears his name was discovered by Majorana\nin 193219 , and independently several times since20,21 ,\nthough it has antecedents in 19th century mathematics22 .\nA very nice discussion can be found in Ref. 23.\nThe result is very simple to state, and represents a generalization of the Bloch sphere for spin 1/2 to arbitrary\nspin. Up to normalization and a phase \u2013 thus in more\nmathematical terms we are parametrizing the complex\nprojective space CP2s \u2013 an arbitrary spin s state can be\nspecified by locating 2s indistinguishable points on the\nunit sphere (see Fig. 1). Such a configuration is sometimes called a constellation, for reasons that will become\nclear.\nThere are two steps to understand why this is so.\nFirst, imagine forming our spin s from 2s spin 1/2 in\nthe totally symmetric subspace. An arbitrary state may\nthen be written as a totally symmetric spinor \u03a6AB***C =\n\u03a6(AB***C) , where the round brackets denote the operation\nof symmetrization and each of the 2s + 1 indices can take\nthe value \u2191 or \u2193. The relationship between \u03a6AB***C and\n\n\u03a6AB***C = \u03b1(A \u03b2B * * * \u03b3C)\n\n(12)\n\nwith the principal spinors \u03b1A , \u03b2B , etc. related to the\n{zi } by\n\u03b1\u2191\n= z1\n\u03b1\u2193\n\u03b2\u2191\n= z2\n\u03b2\u2193\n***\n\u03b3\u2191\n= z2s\n\u03b3\u2193\n\n(13)\n\nrelations that are unchanged if we normalize the spinors,\nin which case they correspond to 2s points on the Bloch\nsphere with coordinates {\u03b8i , \u03c6i }, i = 1, . . . 2s\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b81\n\u03b81\n(\u03b1\u2191 , \u03b1\u2193 ) =\nei\u03c61 /2 cos , e\u2212i\u03c61 /2 sin\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b82\n\u03b82\n(\u03b2\u2191 , \u03b2\u2193 ) =\nei\u03c62 /2 cos , e\u2212i\u03c62 /2 sin\n2\n2\n*** \u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b82s \u2212i\u03c62s /2\n\u03b82s\n(\u03b3\u2191 , \u03b3\u2193 ) =\nei\u03c62s /2 cos\n,e\nsin\n2\n2\n(notice that \u03a6AB***C in Eq. (12) is not in general normalized when the principal spinors are). Then (minus) the\nroots of \u03a6(z) can be written zi = ei\u03c6i cot \u03b8i /2 and correspond to stereographic projection from the north pole to\nthe plane tangent to the sphere at the south pole.\nThe beautiful feature of the Majorana representation\nis that rotations act simply as rotations on the Bloch\nsphere. Of course, it is useful to have an explicit expression for the polynomial \u03a6(z) in terms of the 2s + 1\ncomponents of the spin s state \u03c6. It is easy to show\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\ns\nX\n2s\n\u03a6(z) =\n\u03c6m z s\u2212m\n.\n(14)\ns\u2212m\nm=\u2212s\n\nIf spinor indices are raised and lowered using the antisymmetric tensors \u000fAB and \u000fAB (with \u000f\u2191\u2193 = 1 and\n\u000fAB = \u2212\u000fAB )\n\u03b1A = \u000fAB \u03b1B\n\n\u2194\n\n\u03b1A = \u03b1B \u000fBA ,\n\n\f5\nthen rotational invariance upon contraction of indices is\nguaranteed (in fact the result is invariant under the larger\ngroup SL(2, C), a result that will be useful later) . If we\ndenote by \u03c6\u0304 the result on \u03c6 of raising all indices of the\ncorresponding symmetric spinor, then one can readily see\nthat \u03c6\u0304m = (\u22121)s+m \u03c6\u2212m , and thus\n\u03c6*\u03c8 =\n\ns\nX\n\n1.\n\nAs mentioned in Section II B, Eq. (6), the interaction\nHamiltonian in the spin 1 case may be written\nHint =\n\n\u03c6m \u03c8\u0304m = \u03a6AB***C \u03a8\n\nSpin 1\n\nAB***C\n\nc0 + c2 \u2020 \u00012 c2\n\u03c6 \u03c6 \u2212\n\u03c6*\u03c6\n2\n2\n\nm=\u2212s\n\nAfter raising indices of the principal spinors we have\n\u03b1\u2191 /\u03b1\u2193 = \u22121/z1 , etc.. Under stereographic projection\nz \u2192 \u22121/z \u2217 represents the antipodal map on the unit\nsphere. Thus we see that the spinor \u03c6\u0304\u2217 is represented by\na set of points antipodal to those representing \u03c6. Furthermore, the Majorana representation of a normalized\nstate with |\u03c6 * \u03c6| = 1, corresponding to \u03c6 = e2i\u03b8 \u03c6\u0304\u2217 , consists of pairs of antipodal points (and is thus only possible\nfor integer spin). This fact will be useful in minimizing\nthe interaction energy (recall the form of Eq. (7)). The\ntransformation T : \u03c6m \u2192 (T \u03c6)m = \u03c6\u0304\u2217m is in fact the\n(anti-unitary) operation of time reversal.\n\nThe use of the Majorana representation to visualize\nspin ordering in a Bose gas was suggested in Ref. 24. Let\nus first see how the phases of the spin 1 gas discussed in\nSection III A appear in this representation, before moving\non to the spin 2 case.\n\nSx(2)\n\nFor c2 > 0 we should maximize \u03c6 * \u03c6 . Based on the\ndiscussion of the previous section, this corresponds to\nplacing the two points antipodally in the Majorana representation. It is evident that the corresponding spin 1\nspinor is just the symmetric m = 0 state with respect to\nthe resulting axis. This is just the polar state described\nbefore.\n2\n\nFor c2 < 0 \u03c6 * \u03c6 can be set to zero by making the two\nprincipal spinors equal since \u03b1A \u03b1A = 0. It is clear that\nthis represents the ferromagnet, being a maximally polarized (or coherent) spin state, a result that generalizes\nto arbitrary s.\n\nSpin ordering in the Majorana representation\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n2.\n\nit is easy to convince oneself that up to rotation the most\ngeneral state satisfying these conditions is\n\uf8eb e\u2212i\u03c7/2 sin \u03b7/2 \uf8f6\n\u221a\n\n2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec i\u03c7/2\n\uf8f7\n=\uf8ece\ncos \u03b7/2 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n(17)\n\ne\u2212i\u03c7/2 sin \u03b7/2\n\u221a\n2\n\nThe principal spinors form a polyhedron with four identical triangular faces known as a disphenoid (see Fig. 2).\nTo fix the parameters \u03b7, \u03c7 in Eq.

The aspect ratio of the rectangle\nvaries with \u03b7, with \u03b7 = (2n + 1) \u03c0/3 being a square and\n\u03b7 = 0 corresponding to a pair of points at either pole.\nThe fact that the energy is minimized for any \u03b7 in this\nparameter regime is rather surprising, and we will return\nto it briefly below. This state will be referred to as rectangular in the following (in Ref. 24 it was called nematic\nsince Nab 6= 0).\nFor c2 > 0 |\u03c6 * \u03c6|2 should be minimized.

With the help of\nthe Majorana representation we can now do the same for\nthe spin 2 case. Roughly speaking, we expect the manifold to consist of all configurations related to those of\nSection III C 2 by rotation. Some rotations will leave the\nconfiguration of principal spinors unchanged, however, so\nthe manifold cannot simply be identified with the rotation group SO(3). In mathematical terms the problem\nis to determine the orbits of a reference spinor under the\naction of the spin s representation of the rotation group.\nIf we ignore the phase of the spinor for a moment, so\nthat we are considering orbits in CP2s , this problem can\nbe solved using the Majorana representation by considering the manifold of constellations generated by all possible rotations20 . For instance, the ferromagnetic spin\n1 state has orbit in CP2 equal to S 2 (and this is true\nin general for any spin s coherent state), while for the\npolar state we have S 2 with antipodal points identified:\nthe real projective plane RP2 . In general if one finds a\nconfiguration of principal spinors unchanged under some\nsubgroup of \u0393 \u2282 SO(3) (the stabilizer subgroup of a constellation), then the orbit is given by SO(3)/\u0393. Thus in\nthe case of spin 1, \u0393 = SO(2) for the ferromagnet and\n\u0393 = O(2) in the polar phase, since in the latter case a\nparity transformation also leaves the points unchanged.\nThe reader will notice that these are not the order\nparameter manifolds identified in Section III A for the\nspin 1 case. We have neglected the phase of the spinor,\nwhich is a real degree of freedom. We might then guess\nthat any spinor on the order parameter manifold can be\nwritten\n\u03c6R,\u03b8 = ei\u03b8 D(s) (R)\u03c60\n\n(19)\n\nThe inclusion of a sextic term proportional to |J|2 in the\ninteraction energy would lift the accidental degeneracy in\nthe \u03b7 parameter discussed above. A microscopic derivation of such a term is discussed in Refs. 25,26, with a\npositive sign favoring the square state (\u03b7 = (2n + 1) \u03c0/3)\nand a negative sign the uniaxial state in which two pairs\nof points coincide (\u03b7 = 0). The inclusion of such a term\nin our formalism is a straightforward matter, and we will\nnot discuss it further.\nThe rectangular and tetrahedral states evidently have\ncertain discrete symmetries that are rather hard to discern by inspection of Eq. (17), and indeed went unnoticed in the earliest works on the spin 2 condensate5,6 .\nIt appears that the term 'cyclic' used in several works\nto describe the tetrahedral phase is a consequence of a\nmisidentification of the symmetry. This illustrates the\nutility of the Majorana representation in the visualization of spin order.\n\n(20)\n\nwhere D(s) (R) is the spin s representation of the rotation\nR and \u03c60 is some reference spinor corresponding to the\nphase in question. This does not mean that the order parameter manifold is SO(3) \u00d7 U (1), because the stabilizer\nsubgroups mentioned above leave the spinor corresponding to a particular constellation unchanged up to a phase.\nWe denote these phases as \u039b(\u03b3), with \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 . They must\nform a one-dimensional unitary representation of \u0393\n\u039b(\u03b31 \u03b32 ) = \u039b(\u03b31 ) + \u039b(\u03b32 )\n\nmod 2\u03c0.\n\nand allow us to make the identification\n\u03c6R,\u03b8 = \u03c6R\u03b3,\u03b8\u2212\u039b(\u03b3)\n\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393,\n\n(21)\n\n(1)\nshowing that the order parameter manifold is SO(3)\u00d7U\n,\n\u0393\u0303\nwhere the tilde is to denote the action of \u0393 on SO(3) \u00d7\nU (1): (R, \u03b8) \u2192 (R\u03b3, \u03b8 \u2212 \u039b(\u03b3))\nThe simplest case to consider is the polar phase with\n\u0393 = O(2), for which the only non-trivial phase is a \u22121 associated with the parity transformation. If \u0393 were SO(2)\n\n\f7\nT (the other non-trivial one-dimensional representation\ncomes from changing the sense of the 3-fold axes). The\n(1)\ntopological properties of the resulting space SO(3)\u00d7U\n,\nT\u0303\nand the implications for superfluid vortices in the tetrahedral phase, were discussed in Ref. 17.\nFor the rectangular phase \u0393 = D2 in general, but D4\nfor the square case (\u03b7 = (2n + 1) \u03c0/3). Here Dn denotes\nthe dihedral group. The only non-trivial phases occur in\nthe latter case, as may be seen by considering the value\n\u03b7 = \u03c0, when the four points lie on the equator of the\nBloch sphere.

The parity transformation and the associated minus sign are responsible for\nthe identification (\u03b8 + \u03c0, \u2212n) = (\u03b8, n) already discussed\nin Section III A.\nTo turn to a less trivial example, let us see how this\nworks for the case of the tetrahedral phase. In this case\n\u0393 = T , the symmetry group of the tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has 3 orthogonal 2-fold axes, and 4 3-fold axes.\nFor the representative spinor given earlier\n\uf8eb \u221a\u2212i \uf8f6\n2\n\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ecq \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\ni \uf8f7,\n\u03c6=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\u221a\n\n(22)\n\n\u2212i\n2\n\nthe z axis is aligned with one of the 2-fold axes. One\neasily verifies that z axis rotations through \u03c0 leave the\nspinor unchanged. Alternatively, we can align one of the\n3-fold axes with the z axis with the choice (see Fig. 3)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nq0\n\uf8ec 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(23)\n\u03c6=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7,\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8edq \uf8f8\n1\n3\n\n(this is most easily seen by considering the Majorana\npolynomial, which has a root at z = 0). Now a rotation\nthrough \u00b12\u03c0/3 is seen to reproduce the same spinor but\nwith phase factors e\u00b12\u03c0i/3 . It is not hard to verify that\nthese phases form a one-dimensional representation of\n\nand a \u00b1\u03c0/2 rotation about the z axis is seen to give rise\nto a \u22121.\nThis construction generalizes readily to other ordered\nstates of arbitrary spin once the corresponding stabilizer\nsubgroups and phases are identified24 . Note that when \u0393\nis discrete, as for the spin 2 phases other than the ferromagnet, the order parameter manifold is 4 dimensional.\n\n2.\n\nLocal geometry\n\nNext we turn to the local properties of the order parameter manifold. The inner product naturally endows\nthis space with a metric27 . Using the parametrization\nEq.

(25) makes it clear that if \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 6= 0, rotations\nand phase changes are coupled together. There is an arbitrariness in the way the phase is apportioned between\nthe two factors in Eq. (20) that amounts to a choice of\ngauge. This gauge structure was discussed in Ref. 11 for\nthe case of the ferromagnet, the only one of the phases\ndiscussed in Section III with \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 6= 0. The discussion of the general case is relegated to Appendix A. Our\nmain interest is in the other phases having \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 = 0,\nfor which Eq.

The\nphysical meaning is clear: because we have two points at\neither pole the stabilizer subgroup is O(2), so that the\norder parameter manifold is only three dimensional.

It remains to identify the\nconjugate variables. We expect these to be coupled by\nthe first term of Eq. (4), which expresses the conjugacy\nof \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2020 . Substituting the parametrization Eq. (20)\ninto that term gives\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\u03c6\u2020 \u2202t \u03c6 = \u2212\u2202t \u03b8 + i\u03c6\u20200 D(s)\u2020 \u2202t D(s) \u03c60\n\ntion Eq.

Note that\n\u03c6\u2020R,l,\u03b8 S (s) \u03c6R,l,\u03b8 = Rl\nRl is angular momentum in the 'lab frame'. To find the\ndeviation corresponding to \u03c6l , let us consider the state\n\n= \u2212\u2202t \u03b8 + \u03c6\u20200 \u03c9t * S (s) \u03c60\n(28)\n\u0001\nwhere \u03c9t,a = 12 \u000fabc RT \u2202t R cb are the components of the\nangular velocity. By analogy with rigid body dynamics, we refer to this as the 'body frame' angular velocity: Eq. (28) shows that it is conjugate to the 'body\nframe' angular momentum \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 , i.e. that of the unrotated state. As is well known, the time integral of\nthe term i\u03c6\u2020 \u2202t \u03c6 has an alternative interpretation as the\nBerry phase associated with the time evolution of \u03c6. In\nthis context the formula Eq. (28) appears in Ref. 28.\nThus in the cases of interest where \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 = 0 the\nvariables conjugate to the rotations are nonzero only as\none deviates from the order parameter manifold. To account for these deviations we generalize the parametriza-\n\n\u03c6l = N (l)B (s) (l)\u03c60\n\n(30)\n\nwhere N (l) is some normalization factor, and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u22121 \u0001\n(s)\nB (s) (l) = exp\ng\nl\nS\n.\na\nb\nab\n2\nIt is not hard to see that to quadratic order the normalization takes the form\nN (l) = 1 \u2212\n\n1 \u22121 \u0001\ng\nl l + ***\nab a b\n4\n\n(31)\n\nand that to this order \u03c6\u2020l S s \u03c6l = l, as required. The effect\nof the l-distortion on the tetrahedral state is shown in\nFig. 4.\n\n\f9\nUsing the parametrization Eq. (29) in Eq. (28) gives\nthen\ni\u03c6\u2020 \u2202t \u03c6 = \u2212\u2202t \u03b8 + \u03c9 * l,\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1\u2191\n\u03b1\u2193\n\n\u0013\n\nhave a natural action on the Bloch sphere:\n\u2192\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u2191\nA\n, corresponding to a M\u00f6bius transformation on\n\u03b1\u2193\nthe stereographic coordinates z = \u03b1\u2191 /\u03b1\u2193\naz + b\n.\ncz + d\n\nDYNAMICS NEAR THE ORDER\nPARAMETER MANIFOLD\nA.\n\nto first order in l.\nWe make the following aside.\nThe matrix\nD(s) (R)B (s) (l) that acts on \u03c60 is a polar decomposition\nof the Ds,0 representation of an element of SL(2, C)29 .\nNow SL(2, C)/Z2 is isomorphic to the connected Lorentz\ngroup. This isomorphism has a beautiful physical counterpart. The Lorentz transformations have a natural action on the Celestial sphere, the space of light rays on the\npast (say) light cone. Further, the elements of SL(2, C)\n\u0012\n\u0013\na b\nA=\n,\nad \u2212 bc = 1,\nc d\n\nz\u2192\n\nIV.\n\n(32)\n\n(the fact that A and \u2212A correspond to the same M\u00f6bius\ntransformation accounts for the Z2 quotient above). Remarkably, group elements related by the isomorphism\nmentioned above correspond to identical transformations\nof the sphere30 ! The deformations of Eq. (30) are just\nthose generated on the Celestial sphere by a boost of\nthe frame of reference, which in particular determines\nthe aberration of the fixed stars. Thus the name 'stellar\nrepresentation' sometimes used to describe the Majorana\npicture of spin states is more than picturesque.\nWith the parametrization Eq. (29) we have accounted\nfor six spin degrees of freedom (plus the superfluid\nphase): three rotation variables parametrizing the order\nparameter manifold and three conjugate variables. The\nremaining 4s \u2212 6 variables required to specify the spin\nstate do not correspond to any broken symmetries and\nmust describe gapped modes.\nFor the spin 2 case, the missing two degrees of freedom\ncan be readily found by considering the ratio of the two\n(complex) SL(2, C) invariants in Eqns. (18,19).\n\nLow energy Lagrangian\n\nWe are going to use the parametrization Eq. (29) in\nthe Lagrangian Eq. (4). In doing so, we are treating the\nproblem as as constrained dynamical system, in which deviations from the ground state manifold associated with\nthe gapped modes described in the previous section are\nassumed to be infinitely stiff. The Lagrangian for the\nspin degrees of freedom then takes the form\n1\nLspin = \u03c9t * l \u2212 gab \u03c9i,a \u03c9i,b \u2212 Hint (l)\n(34)\n2\n\u0001\nwhere \u03c9i,a = 12 \u000fabc RT \u2202i R cb i = x, y, z, in analogy to\nthe earlier definition of \u03c9t,a . We could additionally allow\nfor a variation \u03b4\u03c1 in the density of the gas, which is conjugate to the phase \u03b8, to describe the density modes, but\nwill not do so here. In Eq. (34) we have not included the\ngradient of the conjugate variables (including \u03b4\u03c1) in the\npart arising from the kinetic energy, as such terms can be\nneglected in the long wavelength limit of interest. The\nconjugate variables do however appear in the interaction\nterm\nHint (l) =\n\n1 \u22121 \u0001\nI\nl l\nab a b\n2\n\n(35)\n\nThe notation is of course chosen to emphasize the rigid\nbody analogy. The precise form of the 'inertia tensor'\nwill depend on the phase under consideration; we discuss\nthe spin 2 phases for definiteness. In that case the interaction Hamiltonian has the form Eq. (7). Computing\nthe quadratic variation of this expression with the conjugate variables is facilitated by the SL(2, C) invariance of\nthe third term: its variation is determined solely by the\nnormalization in Eq. (31). We obtain\n(\n\u0001\nc1 \u03b4ab\ntetrahedral phase\n\u22121\n\u0001\n(36)\nI\n=\nc2\n\u22121\nab\nrectangular phase\nc1 \u03b4ab \u2212 5 g\nab\nIt is then straightforward to eliminate the l degrees of\nfreedom using the equation of motion, obtained from\nEq. (34)\nla = Iab \u03c9t,b\n\n3\n\n\u03bc=\n\nI\nJ2\n\n(33)\n\nThe powers are chosen so that the normalization in\nEq. (30) drops out. By construction \u03bc is unchanged for\nall l and R starting from the state Eq. (17), and could\nbe expressed in terms of \u03b7 and \u03c7.\nThis concludes our discussion of the spin degrees of\nfreedom in a spinor condensate. With this background,\nwe will see that the derivation of the low energy Lagrangian is extremely straightforward.\n\nto obtain the final result\nLspin =\n\n1\n1\nIab \u03c9t,a \u03c9t,b \u2212 gab \u03c9i,a \u03c9i,b\n2\n2\n\n(37)\n\nEq. (37) represents the main conclusion of this work, being the low energy Lagrangian for the spin degrees of\nfreedom of the condensate. It takes the form of a sigma\nmodel in 3 + 1 dimensions with target space SO(3) (if we\nignore the possibility of vortices in the superfluid phase \u03b8\nthe subtle global structure of the ground state manifold\n\n\f10\ndiscussed in Section III D 1 can be ignored). In the case\nof the tetrahedral phase, the metric tensor g = 211, and\nthe Lagrangian Eq. (37) becomes that of the principal\nchiral model, having independent left and right SO(3)\nsymmetries.\nAn alternative form for Eq. (37) follows from noting\nthat, if M = diag (m1 , m2 , m3 )\nh\ni\nMab \u03c9\u03bc,a \u03c9\u03bc,b = tr M\u0303 \u2202\u03bc RT \u2202\u03bc R\n\n\u03c9\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8. The linear equations of motion following\nfrom Eq. (41) are then\n\nwith\n\nFor the spin 2 case Eq.

As a result both g\u0303 and I \u0303 have two vanishing\neigenvalues, and Eq. (39) reduces to the usual O(3)/O(2)\nsigma model.\nB.\n\nEquations of motion and spin wave spectrum\n\nWe find the equations of motion corresponding to\nEq. (37) by writing the variation\n\u0001\nRT \u03b4R ab = \u2212\u03c8c \u000fabc\nThis gives\n\u03b4\u03c9\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c9\u03bc\n\n(40)\n\nSubstitution into Eq. (37) leads to the equations of motion.\n\u2202t (I\u03c9t ) \u2212 \u2202i (g\u03c9i ) + \u03c9t \u00d7 (I\u03c9t ) \u2212 \u03c9i \u00d7 (g\u03c9i ) = 0 (41)\nIt follows from their definition that \u03c9\u03bc satisfy the\n(Maurer-Cartan) equation\n1\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c9\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd \u03c9\u03bc + \u03c9\u03bc \u00d7 \u03c9\u03bd = 0\n2\n\n(42)\n\nNote that if \u03c9\u03bc is interpreted as a non-abelian gauge\nfield, the above condition corresponds to vanishing field\nstrength, and to the absence of topological defects.\nThe equations of motion can be linearized by ignoring the right hand side of Eq. (42), allowing us to write\n\n\u2202t2 I\u03c8 \u2212 \u2202i \u2202i g\u03c8 = 0,\na wave equation describing the propagation of three spin\nwave modes with velocities\nr\nga\nva =\n,\na = 1, 2, 3\nIa\n\nwith ga given by the diagonal elements of Eq.

(17). In the\ncase of the rectangular phase this latter mode appears\ngapless in mean field theory, but as explained in Section III C 2 this is the result of an accidental degeneracy\nthat does not persist in the next order of approximation.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have achieved our goal of providing a framework\nin which the parameters entering the low energy spin\nLagrangian of an arbitrary ordered state of a spinor condensate (with \u03c6\u20200 S (s) \u03c60 = 0) may be easily calculated.\nThough we focused on the spin 2 states, any other state\ncan be treated by the same method once the problem of\nminimizing the mean field energy is solved. The extension of the present formalism to spin ordered Mott insulating phases in which the phase variables are quantum\ndisordered does not present any particular difficulties.\nPerhaps the most interesting problem that we have not\naddressed in detail relates to the character of topological\ndefects in these systems. The occurrence of nonabelian\nstabilizer subgroups means that vortices have very novel\ncharacteristics16,17 . We mention one consequence of our\nwork for the quantum description of such vortices. The\nphase factors associated with elements of the stabilizer\nsubgroups that were discussed in Section III D 1 will appear in the path integral when vortices are present, as\nmay be seen from Eq. (28). Consider an imaginary time\npath integral with fields obeying the boundary condition\n\u03c6(r, \u03c4 + \u03b2) = \u03c6(r, \u03c4 )\n\n\f11\nIf, as we go from \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 +\u03b2, the field at a point r is subject\nto a rotation that evolves from R \u2192 R\u03b3, for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, the\n\u03b8 variable must increase \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 \u2212 \u039b(\u03b3) in order to ensure\nperiodicity of the fields, leading to a phase factor ei\u03c1\u039b(\u03b3)\nin the path integral (\u03c1 is the density). Ref. 31 discusses\nthe effect of these phases for the simplest case of the spin\n1 polar phase (or rather the Mott insulating phase based\nupon it), where they are \u00b11 and the defects are abelian.\nThe nonabelian case remains unexplored.\n\nVI.\n\ntioned in the text, there is an arbitrariness in the apportioning of phase between the two factors of Eq. (20) that\nbelies a natural gauge structure. In other words, Eq. (20)\nis unchanged under\nD(s) (R) \u2192 D(s) (R)e\u2212i\u039b(R)\n\u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u039b(R)\nfor some arbitrary function \u039b(R).
