The soldering formalism essentially combines two distinct Lagrangians manifesting dual aspects of some\nsymmetry (like left-right chirality or self and anti-self duality etc.) to yield a new Lagrangian\nwhich is devoid of, or rather hides, that symmetry. The quantum interference effects, whether\nconstructive [1] or destructive [2], among the dual aspects of symmetry, are thereby captured\nthrough this mechanism. Alternatively, in the Hamiltonian formulation, Canonical Transformations (CT) can be sometimes used to decompose a composite Hamiltonian into two distinct\npieces. A familiar example [3] is the decomposition of the Hamiltonian of a particle in two\ndimensions, moving in a constant magnetic field and quadratic potential, into two pieces corresponding to the Hamiltonians of two one dimensional oscillators, rotating in a clockwise and\nan anti-clockwise direction, respectively. It a! ppears, therefore, that the solder\ning formalism which fuses the symmetries while CT which decouples the symmetries are\ncomplementary to each other. In the present paper, we shall elaborate on these notions by\nconsidering a particular symmetry, namely chirality. This is known to play a pivotal role in\ndiscussing different aspects of two dimensional field theories with left movers (leftons) and right\nmovers (rightons), ideas which have also been used in string theory context [4].\nConsider, eg. two such Lagrangians L+ (q+ , q\u0307+ ) and L\u2212 (q\u2212 , q\u0307\u2212 ), that permit a soldering.\nThe basic variables transform identically under a transformation\n\u03b4q+ = \u03b4q\u2212 = \u03b1.\n\n(1)\n\nThe main idea is to show that although L\u00b1 are not invariant under these transformations, it is\npossible to devise a modified Lagrangian\nL(q\u00b1 , q\u0307\u00b1 , \u03b7) = L+ (q+ , q\u0307+ ) + L\u2212 (q\u2212 , q\u0307\u2212 ) + \u2206(q\u00b1 , q\u0307\u00b1 , \u03b7),\n\n(2)\n\nthat will be invariant. The new (external) field \u03b7 is the soldering field which can be eliminated\nin favour of the original variables by using the equations of motion. An explicit form for \u2206\nis obtained such that L remains invariant under the soldering transformation. The soldered\nLagrangian incidentally, no longer depends on q\u00b1 , but on their difference q+ \u2212 q\u2212 = q. Hence,\nthis Lagrangian is manifestly invariant under the transformations (1).\nThe Hamiltonian obtained from the soldered Lagrangian by a formal Legendre transformation is denoted in terms of its canonical pairs by H(q, p). Performing a CT into a new canonical\nset (Q, P ), the Hamiltonian is changed to H(Q, P ). For systems containing the dual aspects of\nsome symmetry, this H(Q, P ) actually decomposes into distinct pieces,\nH(Q, P ) = H1 (q1 , p1 ) + H2 (q2 , p2 ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the new set (Q, P ) consistis of independent canonical pairs (q1 , p1 ) and (q2 , p2 ). Indeed,\nas we will show later, the matching of the degrees of freedom count between the original and\nfinal system is crucial. It is now possible to identify these pieces with H\u00b1 obtained from the\noriginal L\u00b1 , thereby establishing a connection between the soldering formulation and CT.\nBefore going to field theory in two dimensions, let us first consider quantum mechanics\nin these dimensions where the basic ideas are illuminated in a simple way. A very familiar\nexample, alluded earlier, is provided by the quantum mechanical model [3],\nL=\n\nm 2 B\nK\n\u1e8bi + \u01ebji xj \u1e8bi \u2212 x2i ;\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\ni = 1, 2\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhich describes the planar motion of a unit charged particle in a constant magnetic field B and\na prescribed electric field. The Hamiltonian is given by\nH = pi \u1e8bi \u2212 L =\nwith pi =\n\n\u2202L\n.\n\u2202 \u1e8bi\n\n1\nB\nK\n(pi + \u01ebij xj )2 + x2i ,\n2m\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nPerforming a CT [3],\np+ =\n\nr\n\nx+ =\n\ns\n\nw+\np1 +\n2m\u03a9\n\nm\u03a9\nx1 \u2212\n2\u03c9+\n\ns\n\ns\n\nw+ m\u03a9\nx2 ;\n2\n\n1\np2 ;\n2w+ m\u03a9\n\np\u2212 =\n\nr\n\nw\u2212\np1 \u2212\n2m\u03a9\n\nx\u2212 =\n\ns\n\nm\u03a9\nx1 +\n2\u03c9\u2212\n\nwhere\nB\n,\nw\u00b1 = \u03a9 \u00b1\n2m\nthe Hamiltonian takes the form\n\n\u03a9=\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\nw\u2212 m\u03a9\nx2 ,\n2\n\n1\np2 ,\n2w\u2212 m\u03a9\n\nB2\nK\n+\n2\n4m\nm\n\n1\n1\n2 2\n2 2\nH = H+ + H\u2212 = [p2+ + w+\nx+ ] + [p2\u2212 + w\u2212\nx\u2212 ].\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nThis corresponds to the Hamiltonian of two decoupled Harmonic Oscillators with independent\ncanonical pairs (x+ , p+ ) and (x\u2212 , p\u2212 ), respectively.\nThe above analysis can be understood strictly in the Lagrangian formalism by following\nour soldering prescription [5]. The Hamiltonians H\u00b1 , in (8) can be derived from the following\nLagrangians respectively,\n1\n2 2\nL+ = (w+ \u01ebij xi \u1e8bj \u2212 w+\nxi ) ;\n2\n\n1\n2 2\nL\u2212 = (\u2212w\u2212 \u01ebij yi \u1e8fj \u2212 w\u2212\nyi ) ,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhich have a non-trivial algebra, following from their symplectic structure,\n{xi , xj } = \u2212\n\n1\n\u01ebij ;\nw+\n\n{yi , yj } =\n\n1\n\u01ebij .\nw\u2212\n\nThese characterise one dimensional oscillators rotating in the clockwise and anti-clockwise sense\nwith frequencies w+ and w\u2212 respectively. Hence L+ and L\u2212 can be soldered as shown in [5, 6]. In\nfact, L\u00b1 mimic the left and right movers ,(or leftons and rightons), which one usually associates\nwith chiral field theory models in two dimensional space time. The basic steps of soldering are\njust recapitulated. Consider the transformations,\n\u03b4xi = \u03b4yi = \u03b7i .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is possible to construct a modified Lagrangian, [5]\n1 2\n2\n+ w\u2212\n)Wi2 ,\nL = L+ (xi ) + L\u2212 (yi ) + Wi [Ji+ (xi ) + Ji\u2212 (yi )] \u2212 (w+\n2\nwith\nJ\u00b1i (zi ) = w\u00b1 (\u00b1\u017ci + w\u00b1 \u01ebij zj );\n3\n\nzi = xi , yi ,\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhich is invariant under the transformations (10) together with \u03b4Wi = \u01ebij \u03b7j . Eliminating the\nsoldering field Wi from (11) we obtain the final Lagrangian in terms of the difference of original\nvariables,\n1\n1\n1\nL = \u1e8ai2 + (w\u2212 \u2212 w+ )\u01ebij Xi \u1e8aj \u2212 w+ w\u2212 Xi2 ; Xi =\n2\n2\n2\n\ns\n\nw+ w\u2212\n(xi \u2212 yi ).\n2\n2\nw+\n+ w\u2212\n\n(12)\n\nWith the identifications,\n\nK\nB\n, w\u2212 w+ =\nm\nm\nwhich follow from (7), the above Lagrangian goes over to (4). This shows the dual roles of\nsoldering and CT complementing each other. It is however essential that the oscillators must\nhave the left-right symmetry (as in (9) to effect the soldering. Observe that if w+ = w\u2212 , then\n(12) just reduces to the Lagrangian of a two-dimensional oscillator. Physically speaking, two\none dimensional chiral oscillators moving in opposite directions have been combined to yield a\nconventional planar oscillator. If, however, w+ 6= w\u2212 , the left and right oscillators do not cancel\nso that a net rotational motion survives. This is the origin of the generation of the \"magnetic\nfield\" effect in (12).\nLet us now consider two dimensional field theory. An explicit one loop computation of the\ntwo dimensional chiral fermion determinant in the presence of an external abelian gauge field,\nyields [7], in the bosonised language, the following results,\nw\u2212 \u2212 w+ = \u2212\n\n1 Z 2\nW\u00b1 =\nd x(\u2202+ \u03c6\u2202\u2212 \u03c6 + 2eA\u00b1 \u2202\u2213 \u03c6 + ae2 A+ A\u2212 ).\n4\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have introduced light cone variables,\n1\n1\nA\u00b1 = \u221a (A0 \u00b1 A1 ) = A\u2213 ; \u2202\u00b1 = \u221a (\u22020 \u00b1 \u22021 ) = \u2202 \u2213 ,\n2\n2\nand a is a parameter manifesting bosonization or regularization ambiguities. Note that our\nregularization preserves Bose symmetry [8], so that the same factor a appears in either expression. The soldering of W+ (\u03c6) with W\u2212 (\u03c1) is easily done [1] by exploiting the relevant chiral\nsymmetries. Consider the transformation,\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b1; \u03b4A\u00b1 = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nIntroducing the soldering fields B\u00b1 , it is possible to verify that the modified effective action,\nW [\u03c6, \u03c1] = W+ [\u03c6] + W\u2212 [\u03c1] \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd2 x[B\u2212 J+ (\u03c6) + B+ J\u2212 (\u03c1)] +\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 xB+ B\u2212 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith the currents,\n\n1\n(\u2202\u00b1 \u03b7 + eA\u00b1 ); \u03b7 = \u03c6, \u03c1,\n2\u03c0\nis invariant under the symmetry including (14) and \u03b4B\u00b1 = \u2202\u00b1 \u03b1. Eliminating B\u00b1 , by using the\nequations of motion, the soldered effective action is given by\nJ\u00b1 (\u03b7) =\n\nW [\u03b8] =\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 x(\u2202+ \u03b8\u2202\u2212 \u03b8 + 2eA+ \u2202\u2212 \u03b8 \u2212 2eA\u2212 \u2202+ \u03b8 + 2(a \u2212 1)e2 A+ A\u2212 ),\n4\n\n(16)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c1. Conventional gauge invariance is restored for a = 1. Thus with this particular\nvalue, we see how the individual components pertaining to the left and right chiral effective\nactions are soldered to yield the gauge invariant result for the vector effective action. This is\nan example of a constructive interference. If we had included the conventional Maxwell (gauge\nfield) term, then this analysis shows how the two massless modes of the chiral models (a = 1)\nare fused to yield the single massive mode of the vector Schwinger model [1].\nThe above analysis has an exact analogue in the Hamiltonian formulation based on CTs.\nThe gauge invariant (a = 1) Lagrangian for the vector theory (16) is reexpressed as,\nW =\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd2 xL;\n\n\u221a\n1\nL = (\u03b8\u03072 \u2212 \u03b8\u20322 ) + 2e[A+ (\u03b8\u0307 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) \u2212 A\u2212 (\u03b8\u0307 + \u03b8\u2032 )].\n2\n\n(17)\n\nThe corresponding Hamiltonian is\n1\nH = [(\u03c0 \u2212 eA+ + eA\u2212 )2 + \u03b8\u20322 ] + e(A+ + A\u2212 )\u03b8\u2032 ,\n(18)\n2\n\u221a\nwhere we have scaled 2e \u2261 e and \u03c0 = \u2202L\n. The Hamiltonian in (18), under the following CT,\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0307\n1\n\u03b8\u2032 = (\u2212\u03b81\u2032 + \u03c01 + \u03b82\u2032 + \u03c02 ),\n2\n1\n\u03c0 = (\u03b81\u2032 \u2212 \u03c01 + \u03b82\u2032 + \u03c02 ),\n2\nwhere (\u03b81 , \u03c01 ) and (\u03b82 , \u03c02 ) are the new canonical pairs, gets decoupled and is given by\n\n(19)\n\n1\n1\n1\ne2\n1\nH = [( \u03b81\u2032 \u2212 \u03c01 )2 \u2212 2eA+ ( \u03b81\u2032 \u2212 \u03c01 ) + (A2+ \u2212 A+ A\u2212 )]\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\ne2\n1\n1\n1\n+ [( \u03b82\u2032 + \u03c02 )2 + 2eA\u2212 ( \u03b82\u2032 + \u03c02 ) + (A2\u2212 \u2212 A+ A\u2212 )] = HR + HL ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere the independent pieces are\n\n(20)\n\nHR = [(\u03c8R\u2032 )2 \u2212 2eA+ \u03c8R\u2032 +\n\ne2 2\n(A \u2212 A+ A\u2212 )],\n2 +\n\n(21)\n\nHL = [(\u03c8L\u2032 )2 + 2eA\u2212 \u03c8L\u2032 +\n\ne2 2\n(A \u2212 A+ A\u2212 )].\n2 \u2212\n\n(22)\n\nHere we have identified\n\n1\n1\n\u03c8L\u2032 \u2261 \u03b82\u2032 + \u03c02 ,\n2\n2\nwhich corresponds to the basic algebra,\n1\n{\u03c8L (x), \u03c8L (y)} = \u03b4 \u2032 (x \u2212 y),\n2\n\n1\n1\n\u03c8R\u2032 \u2261 \u03b81\u2032 \u2212 \u03c01 ,\n2\n2\n1\n{\u03c8R (x), \u03c8R (y)} = \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 (x \u2212 y).\n2\n\n(23)\n\nThis is nothing but the well known left and right chiral boson algebra [9]. It is seen that the\noriginal Hamiltonian has decoupled into two distinct pieces which are identified with the left\nand right gauged chiral boson Hamiltonians [10], associated with a gauged lefton and righton,\nrespectively.\n5\n\n\fA word about the degree of freedom count may be useful. The CT has decomposed the\noriginal boson to two (left and right) chiral bosons. A single degree of freedom in configuration\nspace is thus shown to consist of two times half a degree of freedom, also in configuration space.\nOn the other hand, we now apply the above CTs to the original Lagrangians L+ (\u03c6) and\nL\u2212 (\u03c1), defined from (13), that were being soldered,\ne2\n1\nL\u2212 (\u03c1) = (\u03c1\u03072 \u2212 \u03c1\u20322 ) + eA\u2212 (\u03c1\u0307 + \u03c1\u2032 ) + A+ A\u2212 ,\n2\n2\n1\ne2\nL+ (\u03c6) = (\u03c6\u03072 \u2212 \u03c6\u20322 ) + eA+ (\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 ) + A+ A\u2212 .\n2\n2\n\u221a\nAgain we have scaled 2e \u2261 e.

Both H+ and H\u2212 have split up into two components such that there is a free chiral\nboson and an interacting one of opposite chirality. Ignoring the free chiral component the\ninteracting ones exactly match with the gauged chiral components in (21,22), with the following\nidentification \u03b7R \u2261 \u03c8R , \u2212 \u03c7L \u2261 \u03c8L . This is the central result of our paper showing how the\nsoldering mechanism in the Lagrangian formalalism and the CT in the Hamiltonian formalism\nare connected. The degree of freedom count exactly parallels the analysis given earlier.\nA more direct contact between the soldering formulation and CT is also possible in this\ncontext. The Lagrangians (24) that were originally soldered have, in their interaction, only\none chiral component. Thus, as far as the interactions are concerned, the effective degree of\nfreedom is only half, the other half being free. This is more clearly seen in the structure of\n6\n\n\fthe hamiltonians in (26, 27). Thus when the Lagrangians (24) were soldered to yield (17), the\nsingle degree of freedom associated with the interaction was revealed, while the free part did\nnot manifest itself. This is nothing wrong since the contribution from the free Lagrangian can\nalways be absorbed in the normalisation of the path integral. However, it is possible to directly\nstart from gauged chiral boson Lagrangians, whose degree of freedom is exactly half. The extra\nhalf degree of freedom assocaited with the free part is non-existant. These Lagrangians are\n[10],\ne2\ne2\nLR = \u2212\u03c6\u0307\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\u20322 \u2212 2e\u03c6\u2032 (A0 + A1 ) \u2212 (A0 + A1 )2 + A\u03bc A\u03bc ,\n(29)\n2\n2\ne2\ne2\n\u2032\n\u20322\n\u2032\n2\nLL = \u03c1\u0307\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 + 2e\u03c1 (A0 \u2212 A1 ) \u2212 (A0 \u2212 A1 ) + A\u03bc A\u03bc ,\n(30)\n2\n2\nwhich precisely correspond to the Hamiltonians HR and HL given in (21,22). We now show\nthat the soldering of LR with LL yields (17). Taking the variations (14) we find,\n\u03b4LR = 2JR \u03b1\u2032 ,\n\n\u03b4LL = 2JL \u03b1\u2032 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the currents are\nJR = \u2212(\u03c6\u0307 + \u03c6\u2032 + e(A0 + A1 )), JL = (\u03c8\u0307 \u2212 \u03c8 \u2032 + e(A0 \u2212 A1 )).\n\n(32)\n\nIntroducing the soldering field B, which transformed as,\n\u03b4B = \u22122\u03b1\u2032\n\n(33)\n\n1\nL = LR + LL + B(JR + JL ) \u2212 B 2 ,\n2\n\n(34)\n\nit is easy to check that the Lagrangian\n\nis invariant under the combined transformations (14) and (33). Eliminating B in favour of the\nother variables yields the soldered Lagrangian. This is exactly (17) with the basic field defined\nas \u03b8 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c1.\nAs a final illustration, which would be a field theoretic extension of the model in (4), consider\nthe self-dual models in 2+1-dimensions [11],\n1\n1\nL\u00b1 (h) = h\u03bc h\u03bc \u00b1\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb h\u03bc \u2202 \u03bd h\u03bb ;\n2\n2m\u00b1\n\nh = f, g.\n\n(35)\n\nA straightforward analysis yields the following field algebras and Hamiltonians (with appropriate renaming of variables),\n{f1 (x), f2 (y)} = \u2212m+ \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(\u01ebij \u2202i fj )2 = (\u03c0f2 + m2+ f 2 ) +\n(\u01ebij \u2202i fj )2 ;\nH+ = fi2 +\n2\n2\n2m+\n2\n2m2+\nand,\n{g1 (x), g2 (y)} = m\u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n7\n\n\f1\n1\n1\n1\n(\u01ebij \u2202i gj )2 = (\u03c0g2 + m2\u2212 g 2 ) +\n(\u01ebij \u2202i gj )2 .\n(36)\nH\u2212 = gi2 +\n2\n2\n2m\u2212\n2\n2m2\u2212\nFollowing the usual steps of soldering of the Lagrangians L+ (f ) and L\u2212 (g) in (35) we get the\nsoldered Lagrangian as [5],\n\u03b8\n1\n1\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd A\u03bb \u2212\nA\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc\u03bd ,\nL = A\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212\n2\n2\n2m\n4m2\n\n(37)\n\nwith\nA\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ;\n\nA\u03bc \u2261 f\u03bc \u2212 g\u03bc ;\n\nm+ \u2212 m\u2212 = \u03b8;\n\nm+ m\u2212 = m2 .\n\nGoing over to the Hamiltonian formulation, the first step is to obtain the canonical Hamiltonian,\nH = \u03a0i \u0226i \u2212 L =\n\nm2\n1\n\u03b82\n\u03b8\n1\n\u03a0i \u03a0i + ( +\n)Ai Ai \u2212 \u01ebij \u03a0i Aj +\nAij Aij .\n2\n2\n2 8m\n2\n4m2\n\n(38)\n\n. Due to the presence of spatial derivatives, it is problematic to decouple the\nwhere \u03a0i = \u2202\u2202L\n\u0226i\nAij Aij term. This may be contrasted with the Maxwell theory where such a decoupling in\nterms of Harmonic Oscillators in the momentum space is possible only after a proper choice of\ngauge, (in particular the Coulomb gauge) [12]. Since the present theory is not a gauge theory,\nthe above mechanism fails. We thus work in the approximation where the term Aij Aij can be\nneglected. In other words, we are looking at the long wave length limit and keep the smallest\nnumber of derivatives. Going over to a new set of independent canonical variables,\n{A\u2212 (x), \u03a0\u2212 (y)} = \u03b4(x \u2212 y);\n\n{A+ (x), \u03a0+ (y)} = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n\n(39)\n\nby the following CT,\n1\nA\u00b1 =\n4\n\u03a0\u00b1 = 4\n\ns\n\ns\n\nm+ + m\u2212\nm+ + m\u2212\n(\u03a01 \u2213\nA2 );\nm\u2213\n2m+ m\u2212\n\nm\u2213\nm+ m\u2212\n1\n(\u2212\n\u03a02 \u2213 A1 ),\nm+ + m\u2212 m+ + m\u2212\n2\n\n(40)\n\nthe Hamiltonian decouples into\n1\nH = [(\u03a02\u2212 + m2\u2212 A2\u2212 ) + (\u03a02+ + m2+ A2+ )].\n(41)\n2\nEach of the pieces is now mapped to the previously obtained Hamiltonians of the self and\nanti-self dual models in the long wavelength limit, using the following identifications,\ng2 \u2261 \u03a0\u2212 , g1 \u2261 A\u2212 ;\n\nf1 \u2261 \u03a0+ , f2 \u2261 \u2212A+ .\n\nThe soldering formalism, as elaborated here, is applicable only for Lagrangians manifesting dual aspects of some symmetry. Exploiting this feature, it is possible to combine these\nLagrangians to yield a new Lagrangian. Canonical Transformations, on the other hand, can\nbe performed on any Hamiltonian. However, the effect of the Canonical Transformation to\ndecouple the Hamiltonian into distinct and independent pieces is essentially tied to the dual\naspects of the symmetry. The roles of the two mechanisms is therefore complementary, which\nhas been amply illustrated here. Apart from this, the canonical transformations given here\nprovide an alternative way of gauging chiral bosons without the necessity of any ad-hoc insertions of constraints [10]. Since the study of gauged chiral bosons has been revived [13], such an\napproach might be useful.\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] E.M.C.Abreu, R.Banerjee and C.Wotzasek, Nucl.Phys.
