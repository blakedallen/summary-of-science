E-mail: anne-marie.lagrange@obs.ujf-grenoble.fr\nHere we show that the ~10 Myr \u03b2 Pictoris system hosts a\nmassive giant planet, \u03b2 Pictoris b, located 8 to 15 AU from\nthe star. This result confirms that gas giant planets form\nrapidly within disks and validates the use of disk\nstructures as fingerprints of embedded planets. Among\nthe few planets already imaged, \u03b2 Pictoris b is the closest\nto its parent star. Its short period could allow recording\nthe full orbit within 17 years.\nGas giant planets form from dusty gas-rich disks that\nsurround young stars through processes that are not\ncompletely understood. Two general mechanisms of such\nplanets have been identified (1): disk fragmentation and\naccretion of gas onto a solid, typically 5-10 Earth-mass\n(MEarth) core. Currently, available models do not offer a\ndetailed description of all the physical and dynamical steps\ninvolved in these processes. The lifetime of gas-rich disks\nlimits the availability of nebular gas and, thus, defines the\ntime window in which gas giant planets can form. Once\nformed, giant planets are predicted to interact with the disk\nand distort it, possibly leading to characteristic disk structures\nthat can be used to infer the presence of planets and to\nconstrain their orbits. Up to now, most giant planets have\nbeen detected around stars orders-of-magnitude older than the\nlifetime of gas-rich circumstellar disks, preventing the\nvalidation of models of disk\u2013planet interactions and the final\nphases of giant planet accretion.\nThe young (~12+8-4 Myr), nearby (19.3 \u00b1 0.2 pc), 1.75\nsolar mass (MSun) star \u03b2 Pictoris (2, 3) hosts a wide (several\nhundreds of AUs), tenuous edge-on circumstellar dust disk\n(4). It is composed of dust particles continuously replenished\nthrough collisions of larger solid bodies (planetesimals,\ncomets), and is referred to as a debris disk (5, 6), in contrast\nto more massive gas-rich counterparts around younger (a few\nMyr) stars. This disk has been studied in great detail over the\npast 25 years. Observations at optical to the thermal infrared\nwavelengths revealed multiple disk structures (7\u20139), as well\n\nas asymmetries in disk size, scale height, and surface\nbrightness distributions (10, 11).\nSome of these structures and asymmetries have been\ntheoretically linked to the presence of one or more massive\nplanets. An inner warp in the disk plane (12, 13), in\nparticular, can be reproduced by detailed models that include\na planetary-mass companion (13, 14). In addition,\nspectroscopic observations over several years revealed\nsporadic high-velocity infall of ionized gas to the star,\nattributed to the evaporation of comet-like bodies grazing the\nstar [see, e.g. (5, 15, 16)]. The observed comet infall has been\nattributed to the gravitational perturbations by a giant planet\nwithin the disk [see, e.g. (17), and references therein]. Taken\ntogether, data and models suggest that the \u03b2 Pictoris disk is\npopulated by dust, gas, solid kilometer-sized bodies, and\npossibly planet(s).\nNear-infrared images of \u03b2 Pictoris obtained in 2003 (18)\nshow a faint (apparent magnitude L\u2032 = 11.2 mag), point-like\nsource at ~8 AU in projected separation from the star, within\nthe North-East side of the dust disk. However, these data\nwere not sufficient to determine whether this source was a\ngravitationally bound companion, or an unrelated background\nstar, whose projected position in the plane of the sky\nhappened to be close to \u03b2 Pictoris. Further observations in\nJanuary and February 2009 did not detect the companion\ncandidate (19, 20), an outcome fully consistent with both the\nproper motion of \u03b2 Pictoris with respect to a background star\nor with the orbital motion of a physically bound companion.\nHere we present high-contrast and high-spatial resolution\nnear-infrared images obtained in October, November, and\nDecember 2009 with the European Southern Observatory's\nVery Large Telescope's (VLT) Adaptive Optics NaCo\ninstrument (21, 22) (see SOM for more details on the\nobservations and data reduction). The images obtained in\nOctober 2009 (Fig. 1) show a faint point source South-West\nof the star, with a brightness (\u0394L\u2032 = L* \u2013 L = 7.8 \u00b1 0.3)\ncomparable to that (\u0394L\u2032 = L* \u2013 L = 7.7 \u00b1 0.3) of the source\ndetected North-East of \u03b2 Pictoris in November 2003 (Fig. 1).\n\n/ www.sciencexpress.org / 10 June 2010 / Page 1 / 10.1126/science.1187187\n\n\fThe source lies at a projected separation of 297.6 \u00b1 16.3 mas,\nand at a position angle (PA) of 210.6 \u00b1 3.6 degrees. Within\nthe error bars, the source is located in the plane of the disk.\nTo confirm the signal detected SW of \u03b2 Pictoris in October\n2009, we gathered further data in November and December\n2009. Together, these data confirm the detection made in\nOctober 2009 (see SOM).\nThe images show that the source detected in November\n2003 could not have been a background object (Fig. 2).\nIndeed, if background, given the star's proper motion (table\nS1, SOM), the Nov. 2003 source would be located and\ndetectable 5.1 AU away, South-East (PA = 147.5 deg) of \u03b2\nPictoris in Fall 2009. The data do not show such a source (fig.\nS2). On the contrary, the source position in Fall 2009 is\ncompatible with the projected position in November 2003 if\nthe source is gravitationally bound to the star (see below).\nBased on the system age, distance, and on the apparent\nbrightness of the companion, the widely-used Baraffe et al.\n(23) evolutionary models predict a mass of ~9 \u00b1 3 Jovian\nmasses (MJup). This value is compatible with those derived\nfrom other groups [see, e.g. (24)] calculations when\nassuming-as Baraffe et al. (23)-that the planets form from\nthe spherical contraction and cooling of a hot, initially nonrotating cloud of gas. However, it is not clear whether the\nbasic assumption of these \"hot start\" models, i.e., the\nspherical contraction, applies to \u03b2 Pictoris b or other planets.\nA leading alternative model (24), recently developed,\nincludes the loss of energy of the infalling gas via an\naccretion shock (core accretion start), resulting in the\naccretion of cooler gas to the forming planet. This \"cold start\"\nmodel predicts luminosities two orders of magnitudes lower\nthan those predicted by the \"hot start\" models at young (~10\nMyr) ages for a ~10 MJup mass planet. The initial difference\nbetween the two models decreases after formation; it remains\nhowever significant for these massive planets even at ages of\n100 Myr (factor of 10). The low luminosities predicted by\nthe\" cold start\" model are not easy to reconcile with the\nbrightness of \u03b2 Pictoris b. This apparent inconsistency\nsuggests that this model overestimates the energy lost during\nthe formation of beta Pictoris b. The assumptions underlying\nthe \"hot start\" or \"cold start\" models are still a matter of\ndebate, and observations of objects such as \u03b2 Pictoris b are\nessential to test them. In what follows, we use the mass\ninferred by the \"hot start\" model because there are lines of\nevidence that the companion cannot be much more massive\n(see below).\nIn order to constrain the orbital parameters of \u03b2 Pictoris b,\nwe took the projected separation measured in November 2003\nand computed the expected position of the planet in 2009\n(SOM), assuming that it moves in a prograde [following\n(25)], circular orbit within the disk or close to the plane of the\ndisk. Comparison between the expected projected separation\n\nin December 2009 and the observed position implies that the\nplanet's semi-major axis is between 8 and 13 AU (fig. S3).\nThis leads to orbital periods of 17 to 35 yr for the planet. The\nsemi-major axis is less strongly constrained in the case of an\neccentric orbit because of the unknown longitude of the\nperiastron. However, for the probable case of a moderate\neccentricity [e < 0.05 (26)], the semi-major axis must be in\nthe range 8 to 15 AU. These orbital parameters are\ncompatible with the non-detection at L\u2032-band in February\n2009 (Fig. 2), given the 4-sigma detection limits at this date\nwhich correspond to projected separations of 6.5 AU. Thus, \u03b2\nPictoris b orbits closer to its parent star than Uranus and\nNeptune do in the Solar System.\nThe planet separation is qualitatively consistent with the\nobservation of belt-like structures in the inner disk at 6 \u00b1 3\nand 16 \u00b1 3 AU (7, 8). The separation and mass are fully\nconsistent with those predicted by dynamical studies that\ninvoked a planet to reproduce the inner disk warp (13, 14). A\nmore massive (>40 MJup) companion at such separations\nwould on the contrary, not be compatible with the warp\nconstraints (SOM).\nFinally, it has been suggested (27) that the 2003 candidate\nplanet could have been responsible for a peculiar photometric\nvariability event observed in 1981, when transiting in front of\nthe star. The 2009 data are compatible with this possibility\n[see also (19)], however, only for a small range of planet\norbital parameters.\nThe detection of \u03b2 Pictoris b follows on the recent\ndetections of planets around the intermediate-mass stars HR\n8799 and Fomalhaut [see SOM and (28, 29)]. These stars are\nalso surrounded by debris disks (30, 31). However, \u03b2 Pictoris\nb orbits closer to its star and is younger than the planets\naround HR 8799 and Fomalhaut (30 to 160 and 100 to 300\nMyr old, respectively, tables S2A and S2B). Our images of \u03b2\nPictoris b provide direct evidence that massive giant planets\ncan form rapidly, on time scales of a few million years within\ncircumstellar disks (32). This is in agreement with studies of\nthe dispersion of primordial disks around young intermediate\nmass stars, which yield typical disk lifetimes of between less\nthan 3 and 6 Myr (16).\nA comparison of the luminosity of \u03b2 Pictoris [8.7 LSun\n(3)] to that of the Sun suggests that the orbit of \u03b2 Pictoris b\nlies at or slightly beyond the disk radius outside which water\nis stable as ice (snow-line). The snowline is thought to\nseparate disk regions where rocky or gaseous/icy planets form\n(33, 34). Indeed, beyond the snowline, the disk surface\ndensity is expected to be higher (factor of 3) than that inside\nthe line; this allows giant planet cores (10 MEarth) to form\nbefore the dispersion of the gaseous nebulae. Core accretion\nmodels suggest indeed that this latter step-the onset of rapid\ngas accretion before the loss of circumstellar gas-is the\ncritical step in forming giant planets. Assuming a core with a\n\n/ www.sciencexpress.org / 10 June 2010 / Page 2 / 10.1126/science.1187187\n\n\fminimum mass of 5-10 MEarth and taking into account the\nsnowline properties as a function of stellar mass and age, the\nmodel of Kennedy and Kenyon (33) determines the snow line\nposition as a function of time, and possible locations of giant\nprotoplanet cores as a function of stellar mass. For a 2 MSun\nstar, the snowline location varies between 2.5 and 4 AU for\nages between 1 and 10 Myr, respectively. In the case of the\n1.75 MSun \u03b2 Pictoris, core-accretion based models predict a\nrapid formation of giant protoplanet cores between ~6 and 18\nAU. The observed orbital radius of \u03b2 Pictoris b is consistent\nwith this range, demonstrating that the planet could have\nformed via core accretion on the same orbit where it is\nobserved today. This possibility is in contrast to the case of\nthe more distant planets Fomalhaut b, HR8799bc, AB Pic b,\nand 2MASS 1207b, which are too massive (tables S2A and\nS2B) to have formed at their present separations (40 AU or\nlarger), via core accretion.\nReferences and Notes\n1. The fragmentation of a protostellar core, as in the\nformation of binary or multiple systems, may lead to\nbodies with planetary masses; however, this mechanism\ndoes not straightforwardly explain the presence of planets\ninside disks.\n2.

The 3-7 MJup companion to the brown dwarf 2Mass1207\nalso formed in less than 5 to 12 Myr. However, its\nformation process (stellar-like or through gravitational\ninstability within disk) is still a matter of debate; no disk\nhas been imaged so far around the parent brown dwarf.\n33. G. M.

Expected positions (spiraling red curve), between\nNovember 2003 (green circle) and December 2009, of the\nsource detected in November 2003 if it was a background\nobject with a projected position at this epoch close to \u03b2\nPictoris. We computed these positions using the proper\nmotion of \u03b2 Pictoris. Epochs of interest are indicated by open\nred circles. The measured positions of the detected sources in\nNovember 2003 and in Fall 2009 are indicated by\nrespectively the green and blue filled circles). The gray filled\ncircle indicates the expected position of the planet in\nFebruary 2009, assuming a semi major axis of 8 AU and a\ncircular orbit. The planet position at less than 4 AU from the\nstar, was well below the detection limit of the February 2009\ndata.\n\n/ www.sciencexpress.org / 10 June 2010 / Page 4 / 10.1126/science.1187187\n\n\f\f\f"}
