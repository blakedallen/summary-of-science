We show, from\nthe analysis of three high quality 34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032 CMDs, that the age composition of the\nstellar population is similar at galactocentric distances of \u223c4.7 kpc, \u223c5.6 kpc,\nand \u223c6.5 kpc. The surface brightness profile of the SMC follows an exponential\nlaw, with no evidence of truncation, all the way out to 6.5 kpc. These results,\ntaken together, suggest that the SMC 'disk' population is dominating over a\npossible old Milky Way-like stellar halo, and that the SMC may be significantly\nlarger than previously thought.\nSubject headings: galaxies: Magellanic Clouds; galaxies: halos; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: stellar content\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany important clues about the galaxy assembly process lie in the faint outskirts of\ngalaxies. For example, recent galaxy formation simulations suggest that almost all galaxies,\neven the smallest, should contain an extended old, metal poor, stellar halo (see e.g. Bekki &\nChiba 2005; Read et al. 2006a). Furthermore, evidence of recent merging and/or interaction\nshould remain in the form of extended tidal debris (see e.g. Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2006). The\ndistribution and extent of such debris, or a characteristic underlying old stellar halo are\nboth sensitive to the total mass and extent of a galaxy. Thus, probing the faint edges of\ngalaxies can also give us constraints on their dark matter content.\nThe extended extreme edges of galaxies are observed to be so faint (\u03bc\u226528 mag/arcsec2 ;\nsee e.g. Gallart et al. 2004) that their study has been limited so far to just the Local Group\ndwarf galaxies, in which we can study the flux from the individual stars. Such studies began\nwith the discussion by Sandage (1962) on the outer parts of IC 1613, which showed faint\n1\n\nInstituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Canarias, 38200, La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; noelia@iac.es\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nred stars significantly extended beyond the galaxy's central irregular body. More recently,\nevidence for outer, faint stellar envelopes has been found, for example, in WLM (Minniti &\nZijlstra 1996) and Leo A (Vansevi\u010dius et al. 2004). However, it may be premature to label\nthese extended stellar distributions as an 'old stellar halo' like that observed in the Milky\nWay. There is evidence to suggest that the faint outer stellar populations of nearby dwarf\nirregulars are composed of a range of ages (Old main sequence [MS] turnoff photometry:\nGallart et al. 2004, Hidalgo et al. 2003; C stars: Letarte et al. 2002; CMD modelling:\nAparicio & Tikhonov 2000). In some cases, the extended stellar light is almost certainly\ntidal debris (e.g. the case of Carina, Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2006).\nIn this letter, we present the first evidence for an extended distribution of stars in the\nsouthern direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), up to \u223c6.5 kpc (5.8\u25e6 ) from the\noptical centre of the galaxy. We provide unambiguous information about the age composition\nof this population from a CMD reaching the oldest MS turnoffs. Photometric studies of the\nouter SMC began with Gardiner & Hatzidimitriou (1992) who studied the age composition\nwith CMDs reaching a magnitude limit at R=20, and hence, with MS stars for which it was\npossible to determine precise ages up to \u223c2 Gyr ago. Their contour plots of the surface\ndistribution of horizontal branch (HB)/clump stars reached a galactocentric radius of \u223c6\nkpc in the semi-major axis direction (toward the LMC) but the star counts in these outer\nparts are within the noise level. Carbon stars were also detected in the outer regions of the\nSMC (Hatzidimitriou et al. 1997; Kunkel et al. 2000). Few of these intermediate-age tracers\nwere found in the southern direction up to \u223c7 kpc. Demers & Battinelli (1998) observed 5\nfields in the outer SMC Wing and in the Magellanic Bridge, finding a burst of star formation\noccurred between 10 and 25 Myr ago. Harris (2007) presented a detailed analysis of the\nstar formation history of the young inter-Cloud population along the ridgeline of the HI gas\nthat forms the Magellanic Bridge and searched for the older population in this area. He\nfound an intermediate-age and old population of at 4.4\u25e6 and 4.9\u25e6 from the SMC center in that\ndirection but only young population at 6.4\u25e6 . Recently, No\u00ebl et al. (2007) presented the age\ndistribution of 12 SMC fields, through CMDs which reach the oldest MS turnoff with an\nexcellent photometric accuracy. From the CMD of their outermost field, they inferred that,\nat \u223c4 kpc from the center, the intermediate-age population is still substantial. Here, we\nextend this analysis using images obtained with the WFI at the ESO 2.2m telescope in La\nSilla, Chile. We present the surface brightness together with the age composition of 3 fields\nin the southern direction of the SMC, at 4.2\u25e6 (\u223c4.7 kpc), 4.9\u25e6 (\u223c5.6 kpc), and 5.8\u25e6 (\u223c6.5 kpc)\nfrom the SMC optical center, through the analysis of the CMDs of each of these fields.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nIn order to characterise the stellar content of the outer SMC and to search for the SMC\nouter edge, we obtained B- and R-band images of 3 SMC fields centered at 4.2\u25e6 , 4.9\u25e6 , and\n5.8\u25e6 from the SMC center, respectively. The observations were taken from June 2001 to\nJune 2006, using the WFI attached to the 2.2m telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile,\nwith a 4\u00d72 mosaic of 2048\u00d74096 CCD's. Each chip covers a sky area of 8\u2032 .1 \u00d7 16\u2032 .2. This\ncombination gives a field size of 34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032(aproximately 0.64 kpc \u00d7 0.615 kpc) with a scale of\n0.238\u2032\u2032 /pixel. Figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of our SMC fields. The large squares\nrepresent the WFI fields we present in this paper; they are far from the optical center of\nthe SMC, and lie well-away from any observed HI gas (Stanimirovi\u010d et al. 1999). The small\nsimbols denote the fields observed using the 100-inch telescope at LCO, presented in No\u00ebl\net al. 2007.\nThe coordinates of the WFI fields and the data obtained for each of them are detailed\nin Table 1. The first column denotes the field name; the second and third columns the right\nascension and the declination, respectively; the fourth column, the galactocentric distance\n(r); and the fifth and sixth columns the integration times in B and R. Seeing was typically\nbetween 0.\u2032\u2032 7 and 1.\u2032\u2032 2.\nFor the basic reduction, bias exposures, sky flats, and dome flats were taken every night.\nThe reduction was performed using the MSCRED package within IRAF1 . Profile-fitting photometry of the SMC fields was obtained using the DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR/ALLFRAME\nsoftware packages (Stetson 1987, Stetson 1994). We photometered every chip separately as\nin No\u00ebl et al. (2007). To compensate for the low density of stellar objects in the analyzed\nfields, we combined all chips to obtain a single deep CMD for each field. The aperture\ncorrections were obtained from synthetic aperture photometry by measuring several isolated\nbright stars through a series of increasing apertures and the construction of growth curves\n(Stetson 1990). Errors in the aperture corrections were calculated as the standard error of\nthe mean of these differences, and were typically between \u00b10.001 and \u00b10.003. During the\nphotometric nights, Landolt (1992) standard star fields SA92, SA95, SA104, SA110, SA113,\nRU149 were observed several times for calibration purposes. The total zero-point errors of\nthe photometry, including the error in the extinction, in the aperture corrections, and the\nuncertainties in the calibrations, were \u223c0.03 mag in both B and R bands.\n1\n\nIRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with National Science foundation.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n\nThe CMDs of the SMC outskirts\n\nFigures 2a, 2b, and 2c show the [(B \u2212 R), R] CMDs of the three SMC fields in order\nof increasing distance from the SMC center. BaSTI isochrones (Pietrinferni et al. 2004) are\noverlapped (see caption for details). Stars with at least one valid measurement in each filter\nhave been selected usingp\nthe following limits for the error and shape parameters given by\nALLFRAME: \u03c3(B\u2212R) (= \u03c3B2 + \u03c3R2 ) \u2264 0.15, | sharp |\u2264 0.6 and \u03c7 \u2264 5. A total of 10230\nstars down to R \u2264 23 were measured in field F1 (panel a in figure 2), 7685 in field F2 (panel\nb), and 5642 in field F3 (panel c).\nThe CMD of the innermost field, F1, shown in figure 2a, reaches 1.2 magnitudes below\nthe old MS turnoff, while the CMDs of field F2 (figure 2b) and field F3 (figure 2c) reach\n1 magnitude below this point. Each of these CMDs shows, for the first time, the details\nof the age structure of the stellar population at these outer parts of the SMC. At 4.7 kpc\nand 5.6 kpc from the SMC center (figures 2a and 2b, respectively), the areas around the\n3 Gyr isochrone are quite well populated. It is noticeable that, at 6.5 kpc from the SMC\ncenter, there is still galaxy, with intermediate-age and old stars, as seen in figure 2c. Most\nof the main features of a CMD are present in F3: a quite-well populated intermediate-age\nand old MS and a well-defined subgiant branch. The areas around the 5, 7, 10, and 13 Gyr\nisochrones are well populated in all of the CMDs and there is a lack of a blue extended HB\nin all of them.\nPanel d) in figure 2 shows the [(B \u2212 R), R] CMD of the simulated foreground Milky Way\nstars in the direction of our SMC field2 F2, as obtained using the TRILEGAL code (Girardi\net al. 2005). In the simulation we used the (l,b) coordinates of each of our SMC fields, an\narea in the sky of 34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032 , down to a magnitude of 23.4 in R, an IMF from Kroupa (2001)\ncorrected for binaries, dAV /dr\u2299 = 0.00015 mag/pc, thin and thick discs (squared hyperbolic\nsecants) and a halo. BaSTI isochrones were also overlapped in order to show the loci of the\nstars in the SMC fields. When the CMDs of our SMC fields (figures 2a to 2c) are compared\nwith the foreground simulations, it is clear that the main features of the CMDs mentioned\nabove are not presented in the latter. There are only a few stars in the region occupied by\nthe few Gyr old MS. There is a gradient in the population of predicted foreground stars in\nthe range (B-R)\u22640.8, which increases while going further south.\n2\n\nWe show only one CMD since the three fields have similar foreground stars distributions.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.\n\nThe surface brightness profile: reaching the SMC outer edge?\n\nWe have derived the SMC surface brightness in the three observed fields. In order to\nminimize the error in the substraction of the foreground stars' contamination, we integrated\nthe flux only in the areas of the CMDs in which we expect SMC stars, as shown in figure 2d\n(thick solid lines). We used the predictions of the TRILEGAL model described above for\nforeground substraction purposes, but scaling the flux predicted for the Milky Way stars\ninside the fiducial SMC area shown in figure 2d by the ratio of the observed and predicted\nflux in regions of the CMDs clearly devoided of SMC stars (dot-dashed boxes in figure 2d).\nIn figure 3, we present the surface brightness (in mag/arcsec2 ) of our fields measured\nin B (panel a)) and R (panel b)) bands (filled circles), as a function of distance from the\noptical center of the SMC. The surface brightness of the fields from No\u00ebl et al. (2007) are\nalso plotted. The open triangles represent the eastern fiels, while the filled triangles are the\nwestern fields; the squares denote the southern fields.\nThe total error bar is the difference between the values of the foreground flux in the\nfiducial SMC area as predicted by the TRILEGAL code and after scaling by the ratio of\nobserved and predicted fluxes. The foreground flux predicted by TRILEGAL and actually\nobserved in the boxes devoided of SMC stars in field F1 differed by about 50% in both B\nand R bands in all fields.\nThe measured surface brightness profile is well-fit by an exponential law, with: B(0)=22.3\u00b10.3\nand \u03b1\u22121 =47.62\u2032\u00b10.02, and R(0)=21.5\u00b10.2 and \u03b1\u22121 =52.63\u2032\u00b10.01. Note the slightly shallower\nprofile in R, reflecting the larger extent of the intermediate-age and old populations.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper, we have shown that, at 6.5 kpc from the SMC center, there is still a\nstellar population belonging to the SMC, with a substantial amount of intermediate-age\nstars. Fields located at 4.7 kpc and 5.6 kpc show stars as young as 3 Gyr old and the field at\n6.5 kpc as young as 5 Gyr old. From the analysis of the CMDs, no strong population gradients\nare present in the outer SMC disk, from \u223c2.7\u25e6 outwards (field qj0047-7530 in figure 1, see No\u00ebl\net al. 2007). The origin of the intermediate-age population in the outer SMC fields presented\nhere is still uncertain. If these stars formed at their current positions, it would imply that the\nSMC is significantly more extended (and therefore more massive) than previously thought.\nIts original gas envelope must have extended much further away in the past.\nAlternatively, these stars could represent tidal debris torn off through interactions with\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe Milky Way or the LMC. However, the surface brightness distribution in the outer parts\nis quite smooth. Detailed models of tidal interactions show flat or rising surface brightness\ndistributions (e.g. Johnston et al. 2002; Read et al. 2006b), unlike the falling surface brightness profile we find here. In fact, the surface brightness profile is well fit by an exponential\ndisk, indicating that the SMC disk is dominating over a possible old Milky Way-like halo.\nOur results indicate that the tidal radius of the SMC disk is larger than the 5 kpc proposed\nby Gardiner & Noguchi (1996) and the 6.3 kpc recently suggested by Connors et al. (2006).\nThis strengthens the hypothesis of a larger size for the SMC. An upper limit for the SMC\nsize in the direction of the Magellanic Bridge is provided by Harris (2007), who finds no signs\nof an intermediate-age or old population (but only young Bridge population) at 6.4\u25e6 from the\ncenter. Note, however, that Harris' field is located along the \"minor axis\" of the main body\nand therefore could be misleading to do a direct comparison. More studies further away\nfrom the SMC and with large spatial coverage are needed to confirm the actual extent of the\nSMC.\nWe would like to thank Justin I.

The large squares denote the 34\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032\nfields analyzed here. These WFI fields were chosen to be well away from any observed HI\n(Stanimirovi\u010d et al. 1999).

From left to right, the galactocentric distances are:\n4.7 kpc, 5.6 kpc, and 6.5 kpc. BaSTI isochrones (Pietrinferni et al. 2004) were overlapped.\nOnly the 5 Gyr isochrone is drawn up to the upper red giant branch (RGB) in order to show\nthe extension in color and magnitude of the RGB stars. The expected position of the RC\nis [B,(B-R)]=[18.9,1.3] and indeed an enhancement in the number of stars is observed in\nfields F1 and F2 around this position. Stars as young as 3 Gyr old are still present in fields\nF1 and F2, while there are a non-negligible amount of stars around the 5 Gyr isochrone in\nour most peripheral field, F3. Panel d) shows the TRILEGAL simulation of the foreground\nstars (Girardi et al. 2005) in field F2. The dot-dashed boxes indicates the portion of CMD\ndevoided of SMC stars taken for the scaling (see text for details). BaSTI isochrones were\noverlapped in this simulation to show the loci of the SMC stars. The thick solid lines denote\nthe areas of the CMD selected to obtain the SMC surface brightness.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The surface brightness profile of the SMC in the B (panel a) and R (panel b)\nbands.
