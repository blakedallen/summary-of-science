Physical fields are assumed to be geometrically represented by sections of\nfiber bundles functorially associated with some jets prolongation of the relevant\nprincipal bundle by means of left actions of Lie groups on manifolds, usually\ntensor spaces. Such an approach enables to functorially define the Lie derivative of physical fields with respect to gauge-natural lifts of (prolongations of)\ninfinitesimal principal automorphisms of the underlying principal bundle [5].\nThis concept generalizes that of the natural lift of an infinitesimal automorphism of the basis manifold to the bundle of higher order frames [5]. The\nstructure group of the total space is generalized to be the semidirect product of a\ndifferential group on a Lie group G - the gauge group - which is not in general\na subgroup of a differential group. In particular, in the Einstein(-Cartan)-Dirac\ntheory, the coupling between gravitational and fermionic fields requires the use\nof the concept of a spin-tetrad, which turns out to be a gauge-natural object\n(see e.g. Refs. [3, 6, 7, 8, 9] and references therein).\nHowever, since this construction involves the enlargement of the class of\nmorphisms of the category, such an approach yields an indeterminacy in the\nconcept of conserved quantities. In fact the vertical components of an infinitesimal principal automorphism are completely independent from the components\nof its projection on the tangent bundle to the basis manifold. This implies that\n1\n\n\fM. Palese and E. Winterroth\n\n2\n\nthere is a priori no natural way of relating infinitesimal gauge transfomations\nwith infinitesimal transformations of the basis manifold, e.g. of space-time (see\ne.g. in particular Ref. [8]). It is generally believed that such an indeterminacy\nis somehow unavoidable, and that ad hoc restrictions [10, 11] on the allowed\nautomorphisms of the gauge-natural bundle must be performed, in order to coherently and uniquely define a geometric concept of the Lie derivative of sections\nof gauge-natural bundles. For a quite exaustive review see e.g. Refs. [12, 6, 7, 8].\nFor reasons which will be clear later, due to its invariance with respect to\ncontact structure induced by jets, we consider the geometric framework finite\norder variational sequences [13] as the most suitable for the definition of the\nclass of infinitesimal automorphisms of the gauge-natural bundle with respect\nto wich the Lie derivative of fields can be defined unambigously. In particular,\nin Refs. [15, 18, 17, 19, 20] a variational sequence on gauge-natural bundles\nwas considered, pointing out some important properties of the Lie derivative of\nsections of bundles [1, 5] and relative consequences on the content of Noether\nTheorems [21].\nWe stress the very important fact - although underestimated - that in\nthe category of gauge-natural bundles it is possible to relate the Lie derivative\nof sections of bundles with the vertical part - not the vertical component - of\njet prolongations of gauge-natural lifts of infinitesimal principal automorphisms\n(they coincide up to a sign). The concept of the vertical part of a projectable\nvector field, together with other important related decompositions induced by\nthe contact structure on jet bundles will be defined in the next Section.\nIn Ref. [18] for the first time the fact has been pointed out that - when\ntaken as variation vector fields, in order to derive covariantly and canonically\nconserved Noether currents - such vertical parts are constrained by generalized\nJacobi equations. A restriction on the Lie derivative of fields is then immediately\nderived by the simple request of the covariance of conserved quantities generated\nby gauge-natural symmetries. We notice that necessary and sufficient conditions\n(Bergmann-Bianchi identities [22]) for the existence of canonical covariant conserved currents and associated superpotentials can be suitably interpreted as\nNoether identities [23]. By representing the Noether Theorems [21] in terms\nof the generalized gauge-natural Jacobi morphism, the Lie derivative of spinor\nfields is then accordingly characterized as the above mentioned indeterminacy\ndisappears along the kernel of the generalized gauge-natural Jacobi morphism.\n\n2\n\nVariational sequences on jets of gauge-natural\nbundles\n\nConsider a fibered manifold \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X, with dim X = n and dim Y = n + m.\nFor s \u2265 q \u2265 0 integers we are concerned with the s\u2013jet space Js Y of s\u2013jet\nprolongations of (local) sections of \u03c0; in particular, we set J0 Y \u2261 Y . We recall\nthe natural fiberings \u03c0qs : Js Y \u2192 Jq Y , s \u2265 q, \u03c0 s : Js Y \u2192 X, and, among these,\ns\nthe affine fiberings \u03c0s\u22121\n[24].\n\n\f3\n\nM. Palese and E. Winterroth\n\nBy adopting a multiindex notation, the charts induced on Js Y are denoted\ni\nby (x\u03c3 , y\u03b1\n), with 0 \u2264 |\u03b1| \u2264 s; in particular, we set y0i \u2261 y i . The local vector\nfields and forms of Js Y induced by the above coordinates are denoted by (\u2202i\u03b1 )\nand (di\u03b1 ), respectively.\n\u2217\nLet Cs\u22121\n[Y ] \u2243 Js Y \u00d7 V \u2217 Js\u22121 Y . For s \u2265 1, we have a natural splitting:\nJs\u22121 Y\n\nJs Y\n\n\u00d7\n\nJs\u22121 Y\n\n\u2217\n\nT Js\u22121 Y =\n\n\u0012\n\nJs Y\n\n\u00d7\n\nJs\u22121 Y\n\n\u2217\n\nT X\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2217\n\u2295 Cs\u22121\n[Y ] .\n\n(1)\n\nGiven a vector field \u039e : Js Y \u2192 T Js Y , the splitting (1) yields \u039e \u25e6 \u03c0ss+1 =\n\u039eH + \u039eV where, if \u039e = \u039e\u03b3 \u2202\u03b3 + \u039ei\u03b1 \u2202i\u03b1 , then we have \u039eH = \u039e\u03b3 D\u03b3 and the\ni\ninvariant expression \u039eV = (\u039ei\u03b1 \u2212 y\u03b1+\u03b3\n\u039e\u03b3 )\u2202i\u03b1 . We shall call \u039eH and \u039eV the\nhorizontal and the vertical part of \u039e, respectively. The splitting (1) induces also\ns\na decomposition of the exterior differential on Y , (\u03c0s\u22121\n)\u2217 \u25e6 d = dH + dV , where\ndH and dV , the horizontal and vertical differential [14, 24, 25].\nLet P \u2192 X be a principal bundle with structure group G. Let r \u2264 k be\nintegers and W (r,k) P be the gauge-natural prolongation of P with structure\ngroup W (r,k)\nG [1, 5]. Let F be any manifold and \u03b6 : W (r,k)\nG\u00d7F \u2192 F be a left\nn\nn\naction of W (r,k)\nG on F . There is a naturally defined right action of W (r,k)\nG\nn\nn\non W (r,k) P \u00d7 F so that we can associate in a standard way to W (r,k) P the\n.\ngauge-natural bundle of order (r, k) Y \u03b6 = W (r,k) P \u00d7\u03b6 F [1, 5].\n.\nLet A(r,k) = T W (r,k) P /W (r,k) G (r \u2264 k) be the vector bundle over X of\nright invariant infinitesimal automorphisms of W (r,k) P . The gauge-natural lift\nG functorially associates with any right-invariant local automorphism (\u03a6, \u03c6)\nof the principal bundle W (r,k) P a unique local automorphism (\u03a6\u03b6 , \u03c6) of the\nassociated bundle Y \u03b6 . An infinitesimal version can be defined:\nG : Y \u03b6 \u00d7 A(r,k) \u2192 T Y \u03b6 : (y, \u039e\u0304) 7\u2192 \u039e\u0302(y) ,\nX\n\n(2)\n\nd\nwhere, for any y \u2208 Y \u03b6 , one sets: \u039e\u0302(y) = dt\n[(\u03a6\u03b6 t )(y)]t=0 , and \u03a6\u03b6 t denotes the\n(local) flow corresponding to the gauge-natural lift of \u03a6t . This mapping fulfils\nimportant linearity properties [4].\nAlthough the jet prolongation up to a given order of a gauge-natural bundle\nis again a gauge-natural bundle associated with some gauge natural prolongation\nof the underlying principal bundle [5], in general - as it can be easily seen also\nfrom the corresponding local (invariant) expression - the generalized vector\n.\nfield js \u039eV = (js \u039e)V is not the gauge-natural lift of some infinitesimal principal\nautomorphism.\nFollowing Ref. [5] we give the definition of the Lie derivative of a section\nof a gauge-natural bundle. Notice that this object is uniquely and functorially\ndefined by the right invariant vector field \u039e\u0304.\n\nDefinition 1 Let \u03b3 be a (local) section of Y \u03b6 , \u039e\u0304 \u2208 A(r,k) and \u039e\u0302 its gaugenatural lift. We define the generalized Lie derivative of \u03b3 along the vector field\n\u039e\u0302 to be the (local) section \u00a3\u039e\u0304 \u03b3 : X \u2192 V Y \u03b6 , given by \u00a3\u039e\u0304 \u03b3 = T \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03be \u2212 \u039e\u0302 \u25e6 \u03b3.\n\n\fM.

As a consequence, for any gauge-natural lift \u039e\u0302, the\nfundamental relation hold true:\n\u039e\u0302V = \u2212\u00a3\u039e\u0304 .\n\n2.1\n\n(3)\n\nVariational derivatives and Noether identities\n\nLet us now introduce variational sequences on gauge-natural bundles.

In this case the projectable vector field \u039e\u0302 is called a gauge-natural\nsymmetry of \u03bb.\nLet \u03bb be a Lagrangian and let \u039e\u0302V be considered a variation vector field.\n.\n.

Such a decomposition is a kind\nof integration by parts, which provides us with a globally defined gauge-natural\nmorphism playing a relevant r\u00f4le [18].\n.\nDefinition 3 We call the morphism J (\u03bb, \u039e\u0302V ) = E\u03c7(\u03bb,\u039e\u0302V ) the gauge-natural\ngeneralized Jacobi morphism associated with the Lagrangian \u03bb and the variation\nvector field \u039e\u0302V .\nSuch a morphisms has been also represented on finite order variational sequence\nmodulo horizontal differentials [15] and thereby proved to be self-adjont along\nsolutions of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations, a result already well known for first\norder field theories [30]. The same property has been also proved in finite\norder variational sequences on gauge-natural bundles [20] without quotienting\nout horizontal differentials.\nBecause of linearity properties of the Lie derivative of sections of gauge.\nnatural bundles, we can consider the form \u03c9(\u03bb, \u039e\u0302V ) = \u2212\u00a3\u039e\u0304 \u230bEn (\u03bb) as a new\n(r,k)\nLagrangian defined on an extended space J2s (A\n\u00d7Y Y ). This Lagrangian\nplays a very important r\u00f4le in the study of conserved quantities. In fact, it is\nfor example remarkable that when \u03c9(\u03bb, \u039e\u0302V ) is an horizontal differential (i.e. a\nnull Lagrangian) from the First Noether Theorem 1 we get a conservation law\nwhich holds true along any section of the gauge natural bundle (not only along\nsolutions of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations).\nIt is also remarkable that the new Lagrangian \u03c9, in principle, is not gaugenatural invariant. In fact from the gauge-natural invariance of \u03bb we only\ninfer that, for any \u039e\u0302, Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302 [Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302V \u03bb] = Ljs+1 [\u039e\u0302,\u039e\u0302V ] \u03bb + Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302V Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302 \u03bb =\nLjs+1 [\u039e\u0302H ,\u039e\u0302V ] \u03bb and a priori neither [\u039e\u0302H , \u039e\u0302V ] = 0 nor it is the gauge-natural lift of\nsome infinitesimal principal automorphism. Nevertheless it is still possible to derive some invariance properties of the new Lagrangian \u03c9(\u03bb, \u039e\u0302V ) restricted along\nthe kernel of the gauge-natural generalized gauge-natural Jacobi morphism as\nwell as corresponding Noether conservation laws and Noether identities [21].\n.\n2\nLet then \u03b4G\n\u03bb = Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302V Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302V \u03bb be the gauge-natural second variation\nof \u03bb taken with respect to vertical parts of gauge-natural lifts of infinitesimal\nprincipal automorphisms.

From the above Proposition we see that Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302 [Ljs+1 \u039e\u0302V \u03bb] \u2261 0.
