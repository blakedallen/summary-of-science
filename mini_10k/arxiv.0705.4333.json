Let A be a C\u2217 -algebra, and let X be a Banach A-bimodule.\nB. E. Johnson showed that local derivations from A into X are derivations. We extend this concept of locality to the higher cohomology of a\nC \u2217 -algebra and show that, for every n \u2208 N, bounded local n-cocycles\nfrom A(n) into X are n-cocycles.\n\nThe study of the local properties of Hochschild cohomology of a Banach\nalgebra was initiated by introducing the concept of \"local derivations\". Let\nA be a Banach algebra, and let X be a Banach A-bimodule. An operator\nD : A \u2192 X is a local derivation if for each a \u2208 A, there is a derivations\nDa : A \u2192 X such that D(a) = Da (a). This concept was introduced independently by R. V. Kadison [5] and D. R. Larson [6] and it has been interests of studies since then. Kadison's motivation was based on his and J. R.\nRingrose's earlier investigation of Hochschild cohomology of various operator\nalgebras, whereas Larson's motivation was to investigate algebraic reflexivity\n(resp. reflexivity) of the linear space of derivations (resp. bounded derivations) from a Banach algebra. Local derivations have been investigated for\nvarious classes of Banach algebras such as operator algebras, Banach operator algebras, group algebras, and Fourier algebras (see [3], [8], [9] and the\nreferences therein).\nIn [5], Kadison showed that bounded local derivations from a von Neumann algebra into any of its dual bimodules are derivations. He then raised\nthe question of whether the preceding result can be extended to the local\nhigher cohomology. The purpose of this article is to answer affirmatively to\nthis question in more general setting. We show that if A is a C \u2217 -algebra and\nn \u2208 N, then bounded local n-cocylces from A(n) into any Banach A-bimodule\nare n-cocycles. This has already been obtained by B. E. Johnson in [4] for\nthe case n = 1. Our approach is as follow:\nLet A be a Banach algebra, let X be a Banach A-bimodule, and let n \u2208 N.\nIn Section 2, we introduce certain n-linear maps from A(n) into X which are\nmore general than local n-cocycles. We call them n-hyperlocal maps. We\nshow that in order to characterize bounded local n-cocycles from A(n) into\nX, it suffices to first extend them to A\u266f(n) , where A\u266f is the unitization\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Then, by\nimposing certain conditions, one can obtain the result. As it is shown in\nProposition 2.2, the advantage of this technique is that we can \"transfer the\ninformation\" from the lower cohomology to the higher one if we consider\nn-hyperlocal maps rather than local n-cocycles.\nIn Section 3, we apply these ideas to hyper-Tauberian algebras. These\nalgebras were introduced and studied in [9] because of their useful local\nproperties. By using the results of the preceding section, together with\nthe properties of hyper-Tauberian algebras, we show that bounded local\nn-cocycles from A(n) into X are n-cocycles when A is a hyper-Tauberian\nalgebra.\nIn Section 4, we first show that every commutative C \u2217 -algebra is a hyperTauberian algebra. We then apply the results of Section 3 to obtain our\nresult for a general C\u2217 -algebra. Finally, in the last section, we give a characterization of amenable C\u2217 -algebras in terms of the 1-hyperlocal maps.\n1. Preliminaries\nLet X and Y be Banach spaces. For n \u2208 N, let X (n) be the Cartesian\nproduct of n copies of X, and let Ln (X, Y ) and B n (X, Y ) be the spaces of\nn-linear maps and bounded n-linear maps from X (n) into Y , respectively.\nLet A be a Banach algebra, and let X be a Banach A-bimodule. An\noperator D \u2208 L(A, X) is a derivation if for all a, b \u2208 A, D(ab) = aD(b) +\nD(a)b. For each x \u2208 X, the operator adx \u2208 B(A, X) defined by adx (a) =\nax \u2212 xa is a bounded derivation, called an inner derivation. Let Z 1 (A, X)\nand Z 1 (A, X) be the linear spaces of derivations and bounded derivations\nfrom A into X, respectively. For n \u2208 N and T \u2208 Ln (A, X), define\n\u03b4n T : (a1 , . . . , an+1 ) 7\u2192 a1 T (a2 , . . . , an )\nn\nX\n(\u22121)j T (a1 , . . . , aj\u22121 , aj aj+1 , . . . , an+1 )\n+\nj=1\n\n+\n\n(\u22121)n+1 T (a1 , . . . , an )an+1 .\n\nIt is clear that \u03b4n is a linear map from Ln (A, X) into Ln+1 (A, X); these\nmaps are the connecting maps. The elements of ker \u03b4n are the n-cocycles; we\ndenote this linear space by Z n (A, X). If we replace Ln (A, X) with B n (A, X)\nin the above, we will have the 'Banach' version of the connecting maps; we\ndenote them with the same notation \u03b4n . In this case, \u03b4n is a bounded\nlinear map from B n (A, X) into B n+1 (A, X); these maps are the bounded\nconnecting maps. The elements of ker \u03b4n are the bounded n-cocycles; we\ndenote this linear space by Z n (A, X). It is easy to check that Z 1 (A, X) and\nZ 1 (A, X) coincide with our previous definition of these notations.\nLet A be a Banach algebra, and let X be a Banach A-bimodule. By [2,\nSection 2.8], for n \u2208 N, the Banach space B n (A, X) turns into a Banach\n\n\fON LOCAL PROPERTIES OF HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF A C\u2217 - ALGEBRA 3\n\nA-bimodule by the actions defined by:\n(a \u22c6 T )(a1 , . . . , an ) = aT (a1 , . . . , an );\n(T \u22c6 a)(a1 , . . . , an ) = T (aa1 , . . . , an )\nn\nX\n(\u22121)j T (a, a1 , . . . , aj aj+1 , . . . , an )\n+\nj=1\n\n+ (\u22121)n+1 T (a, a1 , . . . , an\u22121 )an .\nIn particular, when n = 1, B(A, X) becomes a Banach A-bimodule with\nrespect to the products\n(a \u22c6 T )(b) = aT (b) , (T \u22c6 a)(b) = T (ab) \u2212 T (a)b.\nLet \u039bn : B n+1 (A, X) \u2192 B n (A, B(A, X)) be the identification given by\n(\u039bn (T )(a1 , . . . , an ))(an+1 ) = T (a1 , . . . , an+1 ).\nThen \u039bn is an A-bimodule isometric isomorphism. If we denote the connecting maps for the complex B n (A, (B(A, X), \u22c6)) by \u2206n , then we can show\nthat\n\u039bn+1 \u25e6 \u03b4n+1 = \u2206n \u25e6 \u039bn .\n2. n-hyperlocal maps and local n-cocycles\nDefinition 2.1. Let A be a Banach algebra, and let X be a Banach Abimodule. For n \u2208 N, let T be an n-linear map from A(n) into X.\n(i) T is n-hyperlocal if, for a0 , . . . , an+1 \u2208 A,\na0 a1 = a1 a2 = * * * = an an+1 = 0 implies a0 T (a1 , . . . , an )an+1 = 0.\nFor n = 1, 1-hyperlocal maps are simply called hyperlocal maps or hyperlocal\noperators.\n(ii) T is a local n-cocycle if, for each \u00e3 = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 A(n) , there is an\nn-cocycle T\u00e3 from A(n) into X such that T (\u00e3) = T\u00e3 (\u00e3). If, in addition, T is\nbounded, we say that T is a bounded local n-cocycle.\nIt is easy to see that every (local) n-cocycle is a n-hyperlocal map. The\nfollowing proposition states some sufficient conditions for a bounded nhyperlocal map to be an n-cocycle. This is critical for us to obtain our\nresult.\nProposition 2.2. Let A be a unital Banach algebra with unit 1 which satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) For every unital Banach A-bimodule X, a bounded operator D : A \u2192 X\nis a left multiplier if and only if ba = 0 implies D(b)a = 0.\n(ii) For every unital Banach A-bimodule X, a bounded operator D : A \u2192 X\nis hyperlocal if and only if\nD(acb) \u2212 aD(cb) \u2212 D(ac)b + aD(c)b = 0\n\n\f4\n\nEBRAHIM SAMEI\n\nfor all a, b, c \u2208 A.\nLet X be a unital Banach A-bimodule, let n \u2208 N, and let T \u2208 B n (A, X) be\nan n-hyperlocal map such that T (a1 , . . . , an ) = 0 if any one of a1 , . . . , an is\n1. Then T is an n-cocycle.\nProof. We prove the statement by induction on n. For n = 1, by hypothesis,\nT (acb) \u2212 aT (cb) \u2212 T (ac)b + aT (c)b = 0\nfor all a, b, c \u2208 A. Since T (1) = 0, by putting c = 1 we get the result.\nNow suppose that the result is true for n = k (k \u2265 1). We show that it\nis also true for n = k + 1. Let T \u2208 B k+1 (A, X) be k + 1-hyperlocal such\nthat T (a1 , . . . , ak+1 ) = 0 if any one of a1 , . . . , ak+1 is 1. We first show that\n\u039bk (T ) \u2208 B k (A, B(A, X)) is k-hyperlocal. Let a0 , . . . , ak+1 \u2208 A such that\na0 a1 = * * * = ak ak+1 = 0, and put\nS = a0 \u22c6 \u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ) \u22c6 ak+1 .\nThen S : A \u2192 X is a bounded operator. We claim that S satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\nbc = 0 implies S(b)c = 0.\n(1)\nLet b, c \u2208 A such that bc = 0. Then\nS(b)c =\n=\n=\n=\n\n[a0 \u22c6 \u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ) \u22c6 ak+1 ](b)c\na0 (\u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ))(ak+1 b)c \u2212 a0 (\u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ))(ak+1 )bc\na0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 b)c \u2212 a0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 )bc\na0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 b)c.\n\nHowever, a0 a1 = * * * = ak (ak+1 b) = (ak+1 b)c = 0, and T is k + 1-hyperlocal.\nHence\na0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 b)c = 0.\nThus (1) holds, and so, by hypothesis, S is a left multiplier. Therefore\nS(a) = S(1)a for all a \u2208 A. However,\nS(1) =\n=\n=\n=\n\n[a0 \u22c6 \u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ) \u22c6 ak+1 ](1)\na0 (\u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ))(ak+1 1) \u2212 a0 (\u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ))(ak+1 )1\na0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 ) \u2212 a0 T (a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 )\n0.\n\nThus S = 0. Hence \u039bk (T ) is k-hyperlocal. Let q be the natural quotient mapping from B(A, X) into B(A, X)/BA (A, X), where BA (A, X) is\nthe space of left multipliers. Since \u039bk (T ) is k-hyperlocal and q is an Abimodule morphism with the \u22c6 actions, q \u25e6 \u039bk (T ) is k-hyperlocal. Moreover,\nbecause of the assumption on T , q \u25e6 \u039bk (T )(a1 , . . . , ak ) = 0 if any one of\na1 , . . . , ak is 1. On the other hand, for every T \u2208 B(A, X),\n1 \u22c6 T = T and T \u22c6 1 \u2212 T \u2208 BA (A, X).\n\n\fON LOCAL PROPERTIES OF HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF A C\u2217 - ALGEBRA 5\n\nThus B(A, X)/BA (A, X) is a unital Banach A-bimodule. Therefore, by\nthe inductive hypothesis, q \u25e6 \u039bk (T ) is a k-cocycle. This means that for\na1 , . . . , ak+1 \u2208 A,\n\u2206k (q \u25e6 \u039bk (T ))(a1 , . . . , ak+1 ) = 0.\nHence, from the equation \u039bk+1 \u25e6 \u03b4k+1 = \u2206k \u25e6 \u039bk ,\n\u039bk+1 (\u03b4k+1 (T ))(a1 , . . . , ak+1 ) = \u2206k (\u039bk (T ))(a1 , . . . , ak+1 ) \u2208 BA (A, X).\nThus, for every ak+2 \u2208 A,\n\u03b4k+1 (T )(a1 , . . . , ak+1 , ak+2 ) = [\u039bk+1 (\u03b4k+1 (T ))(a1 , . . . , ak+1 )](ak+2 )\n= [\u039bk+1 (\u03b4k+1 (T ))(a1 , . . . , ak+1 )](1)ak+2\n= \u03b4k+1 (T )(a1 , . . . , ak+1 , 1)ak+2 .\nOn the other hand, by the assumption on T ,\na1 T (a2 , . . . , ak+1 , 1) +\n\nk\nX\n\n(\u22121)j T (a1 , . . . , aj aj+1 , . . . , ak+1 , 1) = 0.\n\nj=1\n\nAlso,\n\u03b4k+1 (T )(a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 1) \u2212 \u03b4k+1 (T )(a1 , . . . , ak , ak+1 )1 = 0.\nHence \u03b4k+1 (T )(a1 , . . . , ak+1 , 1) = 0. Therefore \u03b4k+1 (T ) = 0, and so T \u2208\nB k+1 (A, X). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to state the main result of this section. We recall that\nthe unitization of A is A\u266f := A \u2295 C with multiplication\n(a, \u03bb)(b, \u03bc) = (ab + a\u03bc + b\u03bb, \u03bb\u03bc)(a, b \u2208 A, \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 C),\nand norm\nk(a, \u03bb)k = kak + |\u03bb|\n\n(a \u2208 A, \u03bb \u2208 C).\n\nA\u266f\n\nThus\nis a unital Banach algebra with unit (0, 1) which is denoted by 1 if\nthere is no case of ambiguity.\nTheorem 2.3. Let A be a Banach algebra such that A\u266f satisfies conditions\n(i) and (ii) of Proposition 2.2. Then, for any Banach A-bimodule X and\nn \u2208 N, every bounded local n-cocycle T from A(n) into X is an n-cocycle.\nProof. We can extend X to a Banach A\u266f -bimodule by defining 1x = x1 = x.\nLet \u03c3 : Ln (A, X) \u2192 Ln (A\u266f , X) be a linear map defined by\n\u03c3(T )(a1 + \u03bb1 , . . . , an + \u03bbn ) = T (a1 , . . . , an ),\nfor a1 , . . . , an \u2208 A and \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn \u2208 C. It is straightforward to check that\nT \u2208 Ln (A, X) is an n-cocycle if and only if \u03c3(T ) is an n-cocycle. Now let\nT \u2208 B n (A, X) be a bounded local n-cocycle, and let (a1 + \u03bb1 , . . . , an + \u03bbn ) \u2208\nA\u266f(n) . By the assumption on T , for \u00e3 = (a1 , . . . , an ) \u2208 A(n) , there is an\n\n\f6\n\nEBRAHIM SAMEI\n\nn-cocycle T\u00e3 from A(n) into X such that T (a1 , . . . , an ) = T\u00e3 (a1 , . . . , an ).\nThus\n\u03c3(T )(a1 + \u03bb1 , . . . , an + \u03bbn ) = T (a1 , . . . , an )\n= T\u00e3 (a1 , . . . , an )\n= \u03c3(T\u00e3 )(a1 + \u03bb1 , . . . , an + \u03bbn ).\nHence \u03c3(T ) is a bounded local n-cocycle, and so it is a bounded n-hyperlocal\nmap. Moreover,\n\u03c3(T )(a1 , . . . , an ) = 0\nif any one of a1 , . . . , an is 1. Thus, by Proposition 2.2, \u03c3(T ) is an n-cocycle.\nTherefore T is an n-cocycle.\n\u0003\n3. Hyper-Tauberian algebras\nThroughout this section, A and B are commutative regular semisimple\nBanach algebras with the carrier spaces \u03a6A and \u03a6B , respectively. Let I be\na closed ideal in A. The hull of I is\n{t \u2208 \u03a6A | a(t) = 0 for all a \u2208 I},\nand it is denoted by h(I).\nLet X and Y be Banach left (right) A-modules. For x \u2208 X, the annihilator\nAnnA (x) of x is\nAnnA (x) = {a \u2208 A | ax = 0 (xa = 0)}.\nAnnA (x) is clearly a closed ideal in A. The hull of AnnA (x) is called the\nsupport of x (in \u03a6A ), denoted by suppA x. We will write \"supp x\" instead\nof \"suppA x\" whenever there is no risk of ambiguity. By [7, Lemma 2.1],\nt\u2208\n/ supp x if and only if there is a compact neighborhood V of t in \u03a6A such\nthat, for every element a \u2208 A, if supp a \u2286 V , then ax = 0 (xa = 0). In\nthe case X = A where we regard A as a Banach (left or right) A-module on\nitself, the support of an element a \u2208 A coincides with the usual definition of\nsupp a, namely cl{t \u2208 \u03a6A | a(t) 6= 0}.\nAn operator T : X \u2192 Y is local with respect to the left (right) A-module\naction if supp T (x) \u2286 supp x for all x \u2208 X. We recall from [9, Definition 4]\nthat A is a hyper-Tauberian algebra if every bounded local operator from A\ninto A\u2217 is a multiplier. If A is unital, then the definition of hyper-Tauberian\nalgebras coincides with the definition of (SD) algebras introduced in [11].\nLet A and B be Banach algebras, and let X be both a Banach left Amodule and a Banach right B-module such that for all a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B and\nx \u2208 X, a(xb) = (ax)b. Then we write X \u2208 A \u2212 mod \u2212 B. If, in addition,\nX is essential both as a Banach left A-module and Banach right B-module,\nthen we write X \u2208 ess. A \u2212 mod \u2212 B.\nDefinition 3.1. Let A and B be Banach algebras, and let X, Y \u2208 A \u2212\nmod \u2212 B. An operator D : X \u2192 Y is hyperlocal with respect to A-mod-B\n\n\fON LOCAL PROPERTIES OF HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF A C\u2217 - ALGEBRA 7\n\nactions if, for all a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B and x \u2208 X,\nax = xb = 0\n\nimplies\n\naD(x)b = 0.\n\nThe preceding definition was introduced in [10] in order to extend the\nconcept of locality for operators in the non-commutative setting (see also\n[3]). It is easily seen that, for commutative C\u2217 -algebras, this locality condition coincides with the usual one. However, as it is shown in Remark 3.4, in\ngeneral the concept of being hyperlocal is weaker than the concept of being\nlocal.\nIn the following proposition, we use the properties of hyper-Tauberian\nalgebras to characterize bounded hyperlocal operators that are defined from\nessential modules over these algebras.\nProposition 3.2. Let A and B be hyper-Tauberian algebras. Then, for all\nX, Z \u2208 ess. A \u2212 mod \u2212 B and Y \u2208 ess.

(i) First assume that Y = B \u2297A,\nwhere the B-mod-A actions on\nb are specified by\nB \u2297A\nd(b \u2297 a) = db \u2297 a , (b \u2297 a)c = b \u2297 ac (a, c \u2208 A, b, d \u2208 B).\n\nb \u2217 be a bounded hyperlocal operator, and let x \u2208 X and\nLet D : X \u2192 (B \u2297A)\ne : B \u2192 (B \u2297A)\nb \u2217 by\na \u2208 A. Define the bounded operator D\ne\nD(b)\n= D(axb) \u2212 aD(xb) (b \u2208 B).\n\nWe claim that D is local with respect to right B-module action. Let b \u2208 B\nand t \u2208\n/ suppB b. There is a compact neighborhood V of t (in \u03a6B ) such that\nV \u2229 suppB b = \u2205. Let c \u2208 B with suppB c \u2286 V . By the regularity of B, there\nis e \u2208 B such that e = 1 on V and e = 0 on suppB b. So\nec = c and eb = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nPut\nK0 (V ) = span{n \u2297 m | m \u2208 A , n \u2208 B and n = 0 on \u03a6B \\ V }.\nb \u2217,\nSince e = 1 on V , for all \u03b8 \u2208 (B \u2297A)\n\n\u03b8e \u2212 \u03b8 = 0 on K0 (V ).\n\n(2)\n\nb \u2217 /K0 (V )\u22a5 by\nLet z \u2208 X, and define the bounded operator T : A \u2192 (B \u2297A)\nT (u) = D(uzb) + K0 (V )\u22a5 (u \u2208 A).\n\n\f8\n\nEBRAHIM SAMEI\n\nLet h \u2208 A such that hu = 0. Then, from (1), huzb = 0 = uzbe. Since D is\nhyperlocal, hD(uzb)e = 0. Hence, from (2),\nhT (u) = hD(uzb) + K0 (V )\u22a5\n= hD(uzb)e + K0 (V )\u22a5\n= 0.\nIn particular, T is local with respect to left A-module action. Since\nb \u2217 /K0 (V )\u22a5 \u223c\n(B \u2297A)\n= K0 (V )\u2217 ,\n\nand K0 (V ) is an essential Banach right A-module, from [9, Proposition 3],\nit follows that T is a right multiplier. Therefore T (uv) = uT (v) for all\nu, v \u2208 A. Hence, if we put u = a, then D(avzb) \u2212 aD(vzb) \u2208 K0 (V )\u22a5 . Thus,\nfrom essentiality of X, we have\ne\nD(b)\n= D(axb) \u2212 aD(xb) \u2208 K0 (V )\u22a5 .\n\ne\ne\nTherefore D(b)c\n= 0, since suppB c \u2208 V .

Therefore\nD(axbd) \u2212 aD(xbd) = D(axb)d \u2212 aD(xb)d.\n\nThe final result follows from the essentiality of X.\nb \u2217 by\nNow consider the general case.

Similar to the argument made in (i) (by replacing Z with\nZ \u2217\u2217 ), we can show that\nc[D(axb) \u2212 aD(xb) \u2212 D(ax)b + aD(x)b]d = 0\n\n(3)\n\nfor all a, c \u2208 A, b, d \u2208 B and x \u2208 X. On the other hand, since A and B\nhave bounded approximate identities, by Cohen's factorization theorem [1,\nTheorem 11.10], there are e \u2208 A, f \u2208 B and z \u2208 Z such that\nD(axb) \u2212 aD(xb) \u2212 D(ax)b + aD(x)b = ezf.\nSo we have the final result if we put c = e\u03b1 and d = f\u03b2 in (3), and let\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\n\u0003\n\n\fON LOCAL PROPERTIES OF HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF A C\u2217 - ALGEBRA 9\n\nTheorem 3.3. Let A be a hyper-Tauberian algebra, and let X be a Banach\nA-bimodule. Then, for n \u2208 N, every bounded local n-cocycle T from A(n)\ninto X is an n-cocycle.\nProof. Let A\u266f be the unitalization of A. By [9, Corollary 10], A\u266f is hyper-Tauberian.\nTherefore, by [9, Proposition 3] and Proposition 3.2, A\u266f satisfies the conditions (i) and (ii) of Proposition 2.2. Hence the result follows from Theorem\n2.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. Let T be the unit circle, and let A := A(T) be the Fourier\nalgebra on T. It is shown in [9, Remark 24(ii)] that there is a closed ideal I\nin A such that I is weakly amenable but I is not hyper-Tauberian. Hence\nthere are bounded local operators from I into I \u2217 which are not multipliers.\nHowever, this is not the case if we consider bounded hyperlocal operators.\nTo see this, let D : I \u2192 I \u2217 be a bounded hyperlocal operator. First, we\nshow that D is hyperlocal with respect to A-bimodule actions. Let a, b \u2208 A\nand c \u2208 I such that ac = cb = 0. Take e, f \u2208 I. Then ea, bf \u2208 I and\n(ea)c = c(bf ) = 0. Thus eaD(c)bf = 0. Hence aD(c)b = 0 on I 3 . However,\nI is weakly amenable, and so, by [2, Theorem 2.8.69(ii)], I 2 is dense in I.\nHence aD(c)b = 0. Therefore D is hyperlocal with respect to A-bimodule\nactions. On the other hand, A is a hyper-Tauberian algebra [9, Proposition\n18]. Hence, from Proposition 3.2, for all a, b \u2208 A and c \u2208 I,\nD(abc) \u2212 aD(bc) \u2212 D(ab)c + aD(b)c = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nDefine the bounded operator D : I \u2192 BI (I, I \u2217 ) by\nD(a)(b) = D(ab) \u2212 aD(b) (a, b \u2208 I).\nFrom (1), it is easy to verify that D is well-defined. Moreover, upon setting\nha * S , bi = hS * a , bi = hS , abi,\nthe space BI (I, I \u2217 ) becomes a symmetric Banach I-module and D becomes\na bounded derivation from I into BI (I, I \u2217 ). Hence D = 0 since I is weakly\namenable. Thus D is a multiplier.\n4. C\u2217 -algebras\nIt follows from the works of B. E. Johnson that C0 (R) is a hyper-Tauberian\nalgebra [4, Proposition 3.1]. One the other hand, Shulman showed that\nevery unital commutative C\u2217 -algebra is hyper-Tauberian [11]. We extend\nthese results by showing that C0 (\u03a9) is hyper-Tauberian for every locally\ncompact topological space \u03a9. For the sake of completeness, we first prove it\nfor the case when \u03a9 is compact.\nTheorem 4.1. Let \u03a9 be a locally compact topological space. Then C0 (\u03a9) is\na hyper-Tauberian algebra.\n\n\f10\n\nEBRAHIM SAMEI\n\nProof. First consider the case when \u03a9 is compact. Let T : C(\u03a9) \u2192 C(\u03a9)\u2217\nbe a bounded local operator. First we show that T satisfies the following\ncondition:\nab = 0 implies aT (b) = 0.\n(\u22c6)\nLet a, b \u2208 C(\u03a9) with ab = 0. So if we put E = supp b, then a = 0 on E.\nSince E is a closed subset of \u03a9, E is a set of synthesis (see [2, Definition\n4.1.12 and Theorem 4.2.1]). Thus there is a sequence {an } in C(\u03a9) such\nthat, for each n, supp an is compact and disjoint from E, and an \u2192 a as\nn \u2192 \u221e. On the other hand, since T is local and supp an is disjoint from E,\nsupp an \u2229 supp T (b) \u2286 supp an \u2229 supp b\n= supp an \u2229 E\n= \u2205.\nTherefore, since supp an is compact, an T (b) = 0. Hence, by letting n \u2192 \u221e,\nwe have aT (b) = 0. This proves (\u22c6). Now let a \u2208 C(\u03a9) be a self-adjoint\nelement, and let A(a) be the C \u2217 -subalgebra of C(\u03a9) generated by {a, 1}.\nIt is well-known that there is a compact subset K of R such that A(a)\nis isometrically isomorphic to C(K). In particular, C(\u03a9) is an essential\nand symmetric Banach C(K)-module. Let d \u2208 C(\u03a9) and c \u2208 C(K) with\ncd = 0. Then, since c \u2208 A and T satisfies condition (\u22c6), cT (d) = 0. Hence\nAnnC(K) d \u2286 AnnC(K) T (d), and so suppC(K) T (d) \u2286 suppC(K) d. Therefore\nT is local with respect to C(K)-module actions. On the other hand, the\nrestriction map f 7\u2192 f |K is a bounded algebra homomorphism from C0 (R)\nonto C(K). Hence, from [9, Theorem 12], C(K) is hyper-Tauberian, and\nso, from [9, Proposition 3], T is a C(K)-module morphism. Hence, for each\nb \u2208 C(\u03a9), T (ab) = aT (b). The final result follows since C(\u03a9) is the linear\nspan of its self-adjoint elements.\nWe now consider the general case. Let \u03a9 be a locally compact topological\nspace, and let \u03a9 \u222a {\u221e} be its one-point compactification. Then, from the\nfirst case, C(\u03a9 \u222a {\u221e}) is hyper-Tauberian. On the other hand,\nC0 (\u03a9) = {a \u2208 C(\u03a9 \u222a {\u221e}) | a(\u221e) = 0}\nand {\u221e} is a set of synthesis for C(\u03a9 \u222a {\u221e}). Thus, from [9, Theorem 7(ii)],\nC0 (\u03a9) is hyper-Tauberian.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to obtain our results for C\u2217 -algebras. We start with the\nfollowing critical theorem which characterizes bounded hyperlocal operators\ndefined over essential modules of a C\u2217 -algebra. This was partially obtained\nin [10, Theorem 2.2] and [3, Theorem 2.17].\nTheorem 4.2. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra, let X be an essential Banach Abimodule, and let Y be an essential or the dual of an essential Banach Abimodule. Then a bounded operator D : X \u2192 Y is hyperlocal if and only\nif\nD(axb) \u2212 aD(xb) \u2212 D(ax)b + aD(x)b = 0\nfor all a, b \u2208 A and x \u2208 X.\n\n\fON LOCAL PROPERTIES OF HOCHSCHILD COHOMOLOGY OF A C\u2217 - ALGEBRA 11\n\nb \u2217 . Let D : X \u2192 (A\u2297A)\nb \u2217 be a bounded\nProof. First assume that Y = (A\u2297A)\n\u266f\nhyperlocal operator, and let A be the unitalization of A [2, Definition 3.2.1].\nWe show that D is hyperlocal with respect to A\u266f -module actions. Let u, v \u2208\nA\u266f and x \u2208 X such that ux = xv = 0. So, for all a, b \u2208 A, (au)x = x(vb) = 0.\nb\nThus auD(x)vb = 0. Hence uD(x)v = 0 on A2 \u2297 A2 which is dense in A\u2297A.\nSo uD(x)v = 0. Now let c and d be self-adjoint elements in A, and let A(c)\nand A(d) be the commutative C \u2217 -subalgebras of A\u266f generated by {c, 1} and\nb \u2217 is hyperlocal with respect to\n{d, 1}, respectively. Clearly D : X \u2192 (A\u2297A)\nA(c)-mod-A(d) actions. Thus, from Theorem 4.1, for every x \u2208 X,\nD(cxd) \u2212 cD(xd) \u2212 D(cx)d + cD(x)d = 0.\nThe final result follows since A is the linear span of its self-adjoint elements. The general case follows from a similar argument made in the proof\nof Proposition 3.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3. In the preceding theorem, if we replace the locality condition\nthat we used in the definition of a hyperlocal operator with the following\ncondition\nax = 0 implies aD(x) = 0,\nthen, by a similar argument and using [9, Proposition 3] instead of Proposition 3.2, we can show that D is a left A-module morphism. We can also\nhave a similar result regrading bounded right A-module morphisms.\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra which is not unital. We can see that, in general,\nour unitization, A\u266f = A \u22951 C, is not a C \u2217 -algebra (as the norm dose not\nsatisfy the correct condition). However, there is an equivalent norm on A\u266f\nthat turns it into a C \u2217 -algebra (see [2, Definition 3.2.1]). Thus we can state\nthe our main result:\nTheorem 4.4. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra, and let X be a Banach A-bimodule.\nThen, for n \u2208 N, every bounded local n-cocycle T from A(n) into X is an\nn-cocycle.\nProof.

By\nTheorem 4.2, for all a, b, c \u2208 A,\nD(acb) \u2212 D(ac)b \u2212 aD(cb) + aD(c)b = 0.\nBy putting c = e\u03b1 and letting \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e we obtain\nD(ab) \u2212 D(a)b \u2212 aD(b) + lim aD(e\u03b1 )b = 0.\nx\u2217\n\n\u03b1\u2192\u221e\nX \u2217 and\n\nSince {D(e\u03b1 )} is bounded, there is\n\u2208\na subnet {D(e\u03b1i )} such that\nD(e\u03b1i ) \u2192 x\u2217 in the weak\u2217 topology. So D(ab) \u2212 D(a)b \u2212 aD(b) + ax\u2217 b = 0.\nDefine T : A \u2192 X \u2217 by T (a) = ax\u2217 and put D = D \u2212 T . It is straightforward\nto check that T is a right multiplier and D is a derivation. Finally, D is a\nderivation if and only if T is zero. However, it is easy to verify that T is\nzero if and only if weak\u2217 \u2212 lim D(e\u03b1 ) = 0.\n\u0003\n\u03b1\u2192\u221e\n\nWe recall that a Banach algebra A is amenable if for any Banach Abimodule X, every bounded derivation D : A \u2192 X \u2217 is inner.\nCorollary 5.2. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra. Then A is amenable if and only if for\nany essential Banach A-bimodule X and every bounded hyperlocal operator\nD : A \u2192 X \u2217 , there are x\u2217 , y \u2217 \u2208 X \u2217 such that D(a) = ax\u2217 \u2212 y \u2217 a (a \u2208 A).\nProof. Let A be amenable, let X be an essential Banach A-bimodule, and let\nD : A \u2192 X \u2217 be a bounded hyperlocal operator. By Theorem 5.1, there is a\nderivation D and a right multiplier T from A into X \u2217 such that D = D + T .\nSince A is amenable, there are y \u2217 and z \u2217 in X \u2217 such that D(a) = ay \u2217 \u2212 y \u2217 a\nand T (a) = az \u2217 for all a \u2208 A. Thus D(a) = a(y \u2217 + z \u2217 ) \u2212 y \u2217 a. The converse\nfollows immediately from Theorem 5.1 and [2, Corollary 2.9.27].\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.3. Let A be a C \u2217 -algebra. Then, for every bounded hyperlocal\noperator D : A \u2192 A\u2217 , there are x\u2217 , y \u2217 \u2208 A\u2217 such that D(a) = ax\u2217 \u2212 y \u2217 a\n(a \u2208 A).\nProof. The result follows from the similar argument to the one made in the\nproof of the preceding corollary together with the fact that every C \u2217 -algebra\nis weakly amenable [2, Theorem 5.6.77].\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] F.
