The infinite dimensional Hilbert space\nof the problem is, however a direct sum: H = H\u2212 \u2295 H+ ,\nwhere H\u2212 is the finite ([s] + 1) dimensional subspace\nspanned by the bound states, while H+ is an infinite\ndimensional subspace with elements obtainable as continuous superpositions of positive energy eigenstates.\nInstead of using the non-normalizable continuum energy eigenstates, we introduce algebraically a true orthonormal basis in H that allows a natural discretization\nof time dependent problems. Let \u03c3 = s\u2212[s], and starting\nfrom the state |\u03c60 i defined by the relation A(\u03c3) |\u03c60 i = 0,\nwe introduce the following series of states\n|\u03c6n i = {\n\nn\nY\n\nCk\u22121 A\u2020 (\u03c3 + k \u2212 1)} |\u03c60 i ,\n\n(7)\n\nk=1\n\np\nwhere the coefficients Ck = k(k + 2\u03c3 \u2212 1) ensure the\nnormalization. We will call the states |\u03c6n i quasi-number\nstates [4]. From the definition (7) it is also seen that the\nneighboring quasi-number states are connected as\nA\u2020 (\u03c3 + n) |\u03c6n i = Cn+1 |\u03c6n+1 i ,\nA(\u03c3 + n) |\u03c6n i = Cn |\u03c6n\u22121 i .\n\n(8)\n\nThe orthogonality of the |\u03c6n i states can be seen by using\nthe commutators (4). In coordinate representation they\nhave the form\np\ny(x) 2\u03c3\u22121\n\u03c6n (x) = n!/\u0393(2\u03c3 + n)y \u03c3 (x) exp(\u2212\n)Ln (y(x)),\n2\n(9)\n\n\f2\nwhere L2\u03c3\u22121\nis a generalized Laguerre polynomial [5, 6]\nn\nof the variable y(x) = (2s + 1)e\u2212x . In contrast to the\nenergy eigenfunctions, these wave functions form a complete orthonormal set of square integrable functions [6],\ntherefore the quasi-number states constitute a true orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space.\nUsing the properties of the supersymmetric ladder operators A\u2020 and A, one can calculate the matrix of H0 in\nthis basis\n\u0001\n2\nh\u03c6m | H0 |\u03c6n i = Cm\n\u2212 s2 + (m \u2212 [s])2 \u03b4m,n\n+([s] \u2212 n)Cm \u03b4m,n+1 + ([s] \u2212 m)Cn \u03b4m+1,n .\n(10)\nIt consists of two blocks, the one corresponding to\n0 \u2264 n, m \u2264 [s] is [s] + 1 dimensional, whereas the other\none, corresponding to n, m > [s] is infinite dimensional,\nand both blocks are tridiagonal. The block structure\nshows that the first [s] + 1 quasi-number states span an\ninvariant subspace of H0 , in which it can be diagonalized. This subspace should coincide with H\u2212 , as H0 has\nexactly [s] + 1 nondegenerate eigenvalues with normalizable eigenstates. The orthogonality relation\nh\u03c6n | \u03c8m i = 0,\n\nfor m = 0, 1 . . . [s] , and n > [s]\n\n(11)\n\nequivalent to the above statement can be proven directly,\nand the expressions of the overlaps h\u03c6n | \u03c8m i for n \u2264 [s]\ncan be determined explicily [7].\nWe will consider the time evolution of molecular vibrations subject to an external classical field as described by\nEq. (2). In the dimensionless units used in Eq. (3) the\nb int = \u2212b\ninteraction term, H\n\u03bc(X\u0302)E(t) can be written as\nHint = \u2212\u03bc(X)E(t),\n\nwhere we have introduced \u03bc =\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b1\nb, with an effective\nqe \u03bc\n(2s+1)qe\n= ~\u03c90 \u03b1 E(t) denotes\n\n(x)\ncharge qe = db\u03bcdx\n|x=0 , and E(t)\nthe electric field strength in our units. As we will solve\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation (2) in the quasi-number state\nbasis, we also need to know the matrix of the dipole moment in this basis. Due to the algebraic properties of\nthe quasi-number states, the matrix of \u03bc(X) can also be\ndetermined analytically for certain cases. Let us suppose\nthat the dipole moment can be approximated by an operator of the form\nP\nP\n\u03bc(X) = i \u03bci (X) = i (ai X + di )e\u2212\u03b3i X ,\n(13)\n\nwhere ai , di and \u03b3i are real numbers. Taking only a\nsingle term with d = \u03b3 = 0 would mean the simplest\nlinear dipole moment borrowed from atomic calculations\nand used sometimes for molecules as well. This latter\napproach, however, overestimates the strength of the interaction at larger atomic separations and leads to an\nunrealistically high dissociation probability.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nBy the aid of Eq. (7) and the fact that \u03bc(X), A\u2020 (q) =\n[\u03bc(X), \u2212iP ] = d\u03bc(X)\ndX , recurrence relations can be derived\n\nfor the matrix elements of \u03bc(X) between the states |\u03c6n i.\nWe have\nh\u03c6m |Xe\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n+1 i = [(n \u2212 m \u2212 \u03b3) h\u03c6m | Xe\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n i\n+Cm h\u03c6m\u22121 | Xe\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n i + h\u03c6m |e\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n i]/Cn+1 ,\nh\u03c6m | e\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n+1 i = [Cm h\u03c6m\u22121 | e\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n i)\n+(n \u2212 m \u2212 \u03b3) h\u03c6m | e\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c6n i]/Cn+1 .\n\n(14)\n\nThen all the necessary matrix elements can be calculated, starting from terms h\u03c60 |X exp(\u2212\u03b3X)|\u03c60 i and\nh\u03c60 | exp(\u2212\u03b3X) |\u03c60 i. These latter can be obtained via\nintegration in coordinate representation using the wave\nfunction \u03c60 (x) of Eq. (9), and we get\nh\u03c60 | Xe\u2212\u03b3X |\u03c60 i =\n\n\u0393(2\u03c3 + \u03b3)\ne\n[ln(2s + 1) \u2212 \u03c8(2\u03c3\n+ \u03b3)],\n\u03b3\n(2s + 1) \u0393(2\u03c3)\n\nh\u03c60 | e\u2212\u03b3X ) |\u03c60 i =\n\n\u0393(2\u03c3 + \u03b3)\n,\n\u03b3\n(2s + 1) \u0393(2\u03c3)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c8e denotes Euler's digamma function [5].\nThe values of the parameters ai , di and \u03b3i can be obtained by fitting the function (13) to experimental dipole\ncurves, or to those obtained from molecular calculations.\nThe quasi-number states constitute a complete orthonormal basis, hence one can expand\nP\u221ethe solution\n|\u03a6(t)i of Eq. (2) in the form: |\u03a6(t)i = n=0 cn (t)|\u03c6n i.\nMeasuring the time t in units of T = 2\u03c0/\u03c90 , the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as the following infinite system of ordinary differential equations\ni\u010bn =\n\n\u221e\n2\u03c0 X\n{h\u03c6n |H0 |\u03c6m i \u2212 E(t)h\u03c6n |\u03bc|\u03c6m i} cm .\n2s + 1 m=0\n(16)\n\nwhere h\u03c6n |H0 |\u03c6m i and h\u03c6n |\u03bc|\u03c6m i are given by the expressions (10) and (14), respectively. We note here that\nthe usual method of solving the time evolution of the\nmolecular state is based on the split operator method\n[8]. That approach solves the partial differential equation corresponding to Eq. (2), and yields an approximate\nwave function of the variables x and t. In contrast, we\nsolve a system of ordinary equations allowing a higher\naccuracy in the calculations.\nWe will apply our method to determine the dissociation probability of a molecule. This is a time dependent\nquantity defined as the projection probability of |\u03a6(t)i\non H+ that can be given as\nP(t) = 1 \u2212\n\n[s]\nX\n\n2\n\n|h\u03a6(t)|\u03c8m i| = 1 \u2212\n\nm=0\n\n[s]\nX\n\nc\u2217m (t)cm (t).

In our calculations we have\nDipole moment matrix elements (Debye)\n\none has to truncate the system (16), and we have to use\na numerical method to find the solution.\nThe restriction of the number of the dynamical equations to a finite number is done here in two steps. First\nwe consider the problem in a large subspace of dimension\nN \u226b [s], and neglect the contribution of those states |\u03c6n i\nfor which n > N . Then the Hamiltonian is represented\nby an operator which is restricted to the finite N dimensional subspace, spanned by the orthonormal system:\n{|\u03c8m i , m = 0, 1, 2 . . . [s] , |\u03c6n i , n = [s]+1, . . . N }. We\n(N )\ndenote this operator by H (N ) = H0 \u2212 \u03bc(N ) E(t) where\n(N )\nH0 and \u03bc(N ) E(t) are the truncated operators, so that\ntheir matrices are of dimension N .\nBefore solving the already finite number of ordinary\ndifferential equations, we perform a unitary transforma(N )\ntion on our truncated basis and bring H0 into diagonal\nform for n > [s], too. Due to the fact that the matrix of\n(N )\nH0 is finite tridiagonal this can be done by the help of a\nvery fast algorithm. This yields positive energy eigenval(N )\nues En ([s] < n \u2264 N ) and eigenstates \u03c8nN , which we\ncan use for the description of the dissociated molecule.\nIf N is large enough, then the lowermost positive en(N )\nergies En follow densely each other, and approximate\nsatisfactorily the continuous energy spectrum above the\ndissociation threshold. In the second step of the approximation, we restrict the calculation to the bound subspace and to those \u03c8nN states with n > [s], for which\nthe dipole couplings with the bound energy eigenstates\nare non-negligible. In the application to be discussed below, it turns out that the latter are significant only for\nthose states that correspond to the lowest positive energy\n(N )\nvalues En with n = [s] + 1, . . . M , so that M \u226a N .\nTherefore, in order to follow the dissociation process, it\nis enough to solve Eq. (16) in the basis |\u03c8m i, |\u03c8nN i,\nwhich means\nPthat we expand the time dependent state\nas |\u03a6(t)i = M\nn=0 bn (t)|\u03c8n i, where now the notation |\u03c8n i\nhas been used also for |\u03c8nN i with n = [s] + 1, . . . M . Then\nwe solve the system of M ordinary differential equations\nthat describes the time evolution of the coefficients bn\nand calculate the dissociation probability via Eq. (17)\nwith the obvious cm (t) \u2192 bm (t) replacement.\nIn what follows we are going to apply our method for\nthe determination of the dissociation probability of the\nnitrogen-oxide (NO) molecule, excited by an appropriate laser field [9]. We have used a Morse potential with\nthe following data in the electronic ground state [10]:\nm = 7.46 a.u., D = 6.497 eV and \u03b1 = 27.68 nm\u22121 ,\nyielding s = 54.54. The potential and the dependence\nof the dipole moment on the interatomic separation are\ndepicted in Fig. 1. The circles show the dipole moments\nof NO at various interatomic separations that we have\ncalculated by an unrestricted density functional method\n[11]. The dotted line is a fitted function of the form\nEq.

The matrix\nelements far from the diagonal are diminishingly small.\n\nchosen the truncation indices to be N = 3000, and\nM = 200, as increasing these values had no effect on the\nresults. (Note that the number of bound states is now\n[s] + 1 = 55). The initial state was taken to be the vibrational ground state, and we devised the excitation with\nthe aim to acheive a significant dissociation probability.\nAccording to [12] one can think of the desired time evolution as a sequence of two-level transitions. There are\ntwo conditions to be fulfilled: the electric field should be\napproximately resonant with the actual transition, and\nits area per transition [12] should be around \u03c0. In order\nto maintain the resonance condition during the whole\nprocess, it is appropriate to use continuously chirped\npulses [12]. If the frequency of the pulse decreases slowly\nenough, then it is possible to consider its effect as a sequence of approximately resonant two-level transitions.\n\n\f4\nFor low vibrational quantum numbers the coupling is\nlargest between the nearest neighbors, therefore at the\nbeginning the excitation has to drive the system through\nthe ladder of neighboring energy eigenstates towards the\ncontinuum. However, as it is seen in Fig. 2, there is a\nminimum in the m \u2192 m + 1 couplings at m = 42, therefore this vibrational quantum number corresponds to a\ntrapping state. This is a consequence of the shape of the\ndipole moment curve (Fig. 1) and it would be absent\nin the linear approximation \u03bc(X) \u223c X. One can circumvent the problem by lengthening the pulse in time,\nbut we present a different route here with the three pulses\nshown in Fig. 3 exploiting other than first neighbor transitions, as well.

As shown in Fig. 3, this probability\nis practically zero before the third pulse.\nIn summary, we have presented a method based on\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics that leads to a system of ordinary differential equations describing molecular time evolution. We have applied this method for\ndevising laser pulses leading to a significant dissociation\nprobability of the NO molecule with a realistic dipole\nmoment.\nWe thank A. Czirj\u00e1k and A.

Dissociation probability is\nalso shown as a function of time measured in units of T =\n2\u03c0/\u03c90 . All three pulses have a distorted secant-hyperbolic\nenvelope (see text) with the data: pulse (1): \u03c4f = 10.27,\n\u03c4t = 246.4, t0 = 41.0; pulse (2): \u03c4f = 71.87, \u03c4t = 61.61,\nt0 = 1297.5; pulse (3): \u03c4f = 71.87, \u03c4t = 61.61, t0 = 2087.6.\nPeak values for all three pulses are: 1.05 \u00d7 108 V/cm.\n\nthree pulses with distorted secant-hyperbolic envelopes:\nE = Ea /[exp(t0 \u2212 t)/\u03c4f + exp(t \u2212 t0 )/\u03c4t ] with different exponentials in their fronts (\u03c4f ), and tails (\u03c4t ). The chirping rates are seen in Fig. 2, while the other data of the\npulses are given in the caption. Using these parameters,\nthe first pulse drives the molecule into a superposition\nof a few states |\u03c8m i around m = 31. As seen in Fig.\n2, the m \u2192 m + 2 matrix elements are getting larger\nhere than those connecting the neighboring states, and\nthe former have also nonvanishing values around m = 42.\nThis implies that a second laser pulse with an initial carrier frequency being in approximate resonance with the\ncorresponding m \u2192 m+2 transition will continue the dissociation process and let the molecular state jump over\nthe trap. After this second pulse, the distribution of the\npopulated states is not so narrow as it was before, which\nis a consequence of the presence of second neighbor transitions. The most probably populated states are now\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: benedict@physx.u-szeged.hu\n[1] P. M. Morse, Phys. Rev. 34, 57, (1929), L. D. Landau\nand E. M.
