INTRODUCTION\n1\n\n\fCivan and Sliepcevich [1, 2] suggested that special matrix solver should be developed to\nfurther reduce the computing effort in applying the differential quadrature (DQ) method for\nthe Poisson and convection-diffusion equations. Therefore, the purpose of the present\ncommunication is to introduce and apply the Lyapunov formulation which can be solved\nmuch more efficiently than the Gaussian elimination method. Civan and Sliepcevich [2]\nfirst presented DQ approximate formulas in polynomial form for partial derivatives in towdimensional variable domain. For simplifying formulation effort, Chen et al. [3] proposed\nthe compact matrix form of these DQ approximate formulas. In this study, by using these\nmatrix approximate formulas, the DQ formulations for the Poisson and convectiondiffusion equations can be expressed as the Lyapunov algebraic matrix equation. The\nformulation effort is simplified, and a simple and explicit matrix formulation is obtained. A\nvariety of fast algorithms in the solution of the Lyapunov equation [4-6] can be\nsuccessfully applied in the DQ analysis of these two-dimensional problems, and, thus, the\ncomputing effort can be greatly reduced. Finally, we also point out that the present\nreduction technique can be easily extended to the three-dimensional cases.\n\n2. DQ APPROXIMATE FORMULAS IN MATRIX FORM\nThe details about the differential quadrature method see reference [2]. By analogy with the\nprocedure incorporating boundary conditions in Civan and Sliepcevich [1, 2], the DQ\nweighting coefficient matrices are modified in advance by using the boundary conditions.\nFor example, considering the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in the xdirection (x\u2208[0,1])\n\n\u03c6 ( 0, y\n\n)\n\n= h\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n\f\u2202\u03c6 (1, y\n\u2202x\n\n)\n\n= q.\n\n(2)\n\nEq. (2) can be approximated by\nN\n\n\u2211A\n\nNj\n\nj =1\n\n\u03c6j = q .\n\n(3)\n\nThe function values at boundary points can be expressed by the unknown interior point\nfunction values, namely,\n\n\u03c6N =\n\n1 \uf8eb\n\uf8ecq \u2212 AN 1h \u2212\nANN \uf8ed\n\nN \u22121\n\n\u2211A\n\nj =2\n\nNj\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03c6 j \uf8f7.\n\n(4)\n\nSubstituting equations (4) and (1) into the DQ formulations for the first and second\nderivatives, respectively, we have\nv\n\n\u2202\u03c6\nv\nv\n= Ax \u03c6 + a x\n\u2202x\n\n(5)\n\nv\n\nv\n\u2202 2\u03c6\nv\n= Bx \u03c6 + bx ,\n2\n\u2202x\n\nv\nwhere \u03c6 = {\u03c6 2\n\n\u03c6 3,\n\n(6)\n\nK,\n\nv\n\n\u03c6 N \u2212 1 } , a x and bx are the constant vectors, A x and B\nv\n\nx\n\nare\n\nthe modified (N-2)\u00d7(N-2) weighting coefficient matrices for the 1st and 2nd order\nderivatives, respectively.\n\nChen et al. [3] presented the DQ approximate formulas in matrix form for the partial\nderivative of the function \u03c8(x,y) in two-dimensional domain:\n~\n\u2202 2\u03c8\n~ + Box ,\n= Bx \u03c8\n\u2202x 2\n~\n\u2202\u03c8\n~ + Ao x ,\n= Ax \u03c8\n\u2202x\n\n~\n\u2202 2\u03c8\n~ B yT + B 0Ty ,\n= \u03c8\n\u2202y 2\n,\n~\n\u2202\u03c8\nT\nT\n~ Ay + Ao y\n= \u03c8\n\u2202y\n\n(7)\n\n~ is a n\u00d7m rectangular matrix rather than a vector as in references [1,\nwhere the unknown \u03c8\n2], n and m is the number of inner grid points along x- and y- directions, respectively. The\n3\n\n\fsuperscript T means the transpose of the matrices. A0x and B0x are generated by stacking\n\nv\nv\nthe corresponding constant vectors a x and bx in Eqs. (5) and (6). For example,\n\nA0x\n\n\uf8ee a 1x\n\uf8efa\n2x\n= \uf8ef\n\uf8ef M\n\uf8ef\uf8f0a\n\nnx\n\na 1x\na 2x\nM\na nx\n\nL a 1x \uf8f9\nL a 2x \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nO M \uf8fa\nL a \uf8fa\uf8fb\nnx\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nn\u00d7m\n\nA0y and B0y can be obtained in a similar way. For higher order partial derivatives, there\nexist similar matrix approximate formulas.\n\n3. COMPUTATIONAL REDUCTION\n3.1 Formulations in the Lyapunov matrix equation form\n\nThe Poisson equations can be normalized as:\n2\n2\n\u03c6\n\u2202 \u03c6\n2 \u2202\n\u03b2\n+\n= 0,\n2 + S\n2\n\u2202 x\n\u2202 y\n\n(9)\n\nwhere x and y are the dimensionless Cartesian coordinates, namely x, y\u2208[0, 1], \u03b2 denotes\nthe aspect ratio, S is a given strength, \u03c6 is the desired variable. For more details see\nreference [1].\n\nApplying the DQ matrix approximate formulas (7), the DQ formulation for equation (9) is\ngiven by\n2\nBx ~\n\u03c6 + \u03b2 ~\n\u03c6 B yT + H = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere ~\n\u03c6 , B x and B y are (n-2)\u00d7(n-2) rectangular matrix, H = S + B 0x + B oyT . Since\nthe boundary conditions have been taken into account in the formulation of weighting\ncoefficient matrices B x and B y , no additional equations are more required.\n\n4\n\n\fThe equation governing steady-state convection-diffusion (e.g., equation (24) in reference\n[2] neglecting time derivative term) can be simplified as\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n,\n+\u03b2\n=\n\u2202x\n\u2202y 4\u03b1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the desired values as defined in equation (23) in reference [2], \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\nconstants. In terms of the DQ matrix approximate formulas [7], we have\n~B T \u2212\n\u03b1B x ~\n\u03c6 + \u03b2\u03c6\ny\n\n1 ~\n\u03c6 = Q,\n4a\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Q is constant matrix generated from the modified DQ weighting coefficient matrices\nas in Eq. (7). Furthermore, the above equation can be restated as\n\uf8eb\n1 \uf8f6~\n~B T = Q .\n\uf8ec\u03b1B x \u2212\nI \uf8f7\u03c6 + \u03b2\u03c6\ny\n\uf8ed\n4a \uf8f8\n\n(13)\n\nThe above DQ formulations (10) and (13) are the Lyapunov algebraic matrix equation.\nCompared with the conventional polynomial form in references [1, 2], they have more\nexplicit matrix form.\n\n3.2 Fast algorithms in the solution of the Lyapunov equations\n\nSeveral efficient methods for solving the Lyapunov algebraic matrix equations have been\ndeveloped in references [4-6]. To simplify the presentation, BS, HS and R-THR denote the\nmethods proposed, respectively, by Bartels and Stewart [4], Golur, Nash and Loan [5], and\nGui [6]. All these methods are stable and accurate. Considering the Lyapunov matrix\nequation\nGX + XR = Q ,\n\n(14)\n5\n\n\fwhere G, R and Q are n\u00d7n, m\u00d7m and n\u00d7m constant matrices. The solution procedures in the\nBS, HS and R-THR methods generally include the following four steps.\nStep 1: Reduce G and R into certain simple form via the similarity transformations G*=U1\n\nGU and R*=V-1RV.\n\nStep 2: F=U-1QV for the solution of F.\nStep 3: Solve the transformed equation G*Y+YR*=F for Y.\nStep 4: X=UYV-1.\n\nThe respective computational effort is listed in table I. The total computing effort in these\nmethods is O(n3+m3) scalar multiplications. For the details on these methods see the\ncorresponding references.\n\n4\nAs can be seen from table I, the R-THR method requires n3+ m3+7n2m+5mn2+n2 (or\n3\n14\n\n1 3 2\nn +n when n=m) scalar multiplications, and may be the most efficient in the solution\n3\n\nof the Lyapunov matrix equations. By using the R-THR method, the same examples given\nin references [1] are recalculated by the DQ method, and the accuracies of results are\ncoincident with those given by Civan and Sliepcevich [1]. However, the conventional\napproach in reference [1] required solving a linear simultaneous equations of (Nx -2)(Ny -2)\norder by using the Gaussian elimination method, where Nx and Ny are the number of gird\n1\npoints along x- and y- directions, respectively. If N=Nx=Ny, about (N -2)6 multiplications\n3\n1\nwere performed. In contrast, the present reduction approach requires about 14 (N -2)3\n3\nmultiplications. Thus, the computational effort is only about 34% in using 7\u00d77 grid points\nand 6% in using 11\u00d711 grid points as much as that in reference [1]. The steady-state\n6\n\n\fconvection-diffusion (example 1 in reference [2]) is also computed by using the present\ntechnique, and the same computing reduction is achieved. The computational effort in the\npresent DQ method for these cases is reduced in proportional to (N -2)3. Reference [6] also\npointed out that the parallel computation was very efficient in the solution of the Lyapunov\nequations.\n\nThe weighting coefficient matrices in the DQ method were found to be the\ncentrosymmetric and skew centrosymmetric matrices if a symmetric grid spacing is used.\nThe present authors [3] applied the factorization properties of centrosymmetric matrix to\nreduce computing effort by 75% in the DQ analysis of structural components. In the\npresent cases with symmetric boundary conditions, we can factorize the centrosymmetric\ncoefficient matrix B x and B y into two smaller size sub-matrices, nearly half, in all the four\ncomputing steps of the BS, HS and R-THR methods. Therefore, the computing effort can\nbe further reduced to 8.5% under 7\u00d77 grid points and 1.5% under 11\u00d711 grid points as that\nin reference [1, 2]. The detailed discussions on the centrosymmetric matrix see reference\n[7] and are not presented here for the sake of brevity.\n\n3.3 On the three-dimensional problems\n\nFor three-dimensional cases, we first convert into it into a set of ordinary differential\nequations by using the DQ matrix approximate formulas (7) and the Kronecker product. It\nis straightforward that the DQ matrix approximate formula for a set of ordinary differential\nequations is similar to formulas (7). Thus, the ordinary differential equations can be\nformulated into a Lyapunov matrix equation. The following examples can illustrate our\n\n7\n\n\fidea more clearly. Considering the three-dimensional steady-state convection-diffusion\nequation (equation (52) in reference [2] neglecting time derivative term)\n\n\u2202c\n\u2202 2c\n\u2202 2c\n= \u03b2\n+\n\u03b3\n.\n\u2202x\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202z 2\n\n(15)\n\nFirst, in terms of the DQ matrix approximate formulas (7), the above equation can be\napproximated as the following ordinary equations,\n~\nd 2C\nT\n~\n~\nAx C \u2212 \u03b2CB y + Q = \u03b3\n,\ndz 2\n\n(16)\n\n~ is a (Nx-2)\u00d7(Ny-2) rectangular matrix, Q= A \u2212 \u03b2B T . By using the Kronecker\nwhere C\n0x\n0y\n\nproduct of matrices [8], we have\nr\nd 2C\n\u03b3\n= Ax \u2297 I\ndz 2\n\n[\n\ny\n\n\u2212 \u03b2I\n\nx\n\n]\n\nv\n\u2297 B y C + Q,\n\n(17)\n\nv\nwhere C is a ((Nx-2)(Ny-2)) \u00d71 vector stacked from matrix C, \u2297 denotes the Kronecker\n\nproduct. The DQ analog equation for the above ordinary differential equations can be\nwritten as\n\n[A\n\nx\n\n\u2297 I\n\ny\n\n\u2212 \u03b2I\n\nx\n\n]\n\n$ zT = R ,\n\u2297 B y C$ \u2212 \u03b3CB\n\n(18)\n\nwhere C$ is a ((Nx-2)Ny-2))\u00d7(Nz-2) rectangular matrix, R=\u03b3B ozT \u2212Q. The equation is also a\nLyapunov matrix equation. Thus, the reduction technique for the Lyapunov equation can be\nused to achieve a considerable savings in computational effort.\n\n3.4. On time-dependent problems\n\nThe governing equation for transient-state convection-diffusion problems can be generally\nstated as (equation (24) in reference [2])\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u03c6\n+\n= \u03b1\n+ \u03b2\n.\n\u2202t\n4\u03b1\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n(19)\n\n8\n\n\fSimilar to steady-state cases, the DQ analog equation can be expressed as\n\uf8eb\nd\u03c6\n1 \uf8f6~\n~B T \u2212 Q .\nI \uf8f7\u03c6 + \u03b2\u03c6\n= \uf8ec\u03b1B x \u2212\ny\n\uf8ed\ndt\n4a \uf8f8\n\n(20)\n\nThe above DQ approximation equation is the simplified Riccati differential equation,\nnamely, the quadratic nonlinear term in the Riccati differential equation is omitted. Choi\nand Laub [9] have successfully applied the fast algorithms for solving the Lyapunov\nequation to time-varying Riccati differential equation, while it is an easier task to apply\nthese fast algorithms for calculating equation (20) in the same way as in reference [9]. The\ncomputational effort is reduced by three orders of magnitude as in the foregoing steady\ncases. Therefore, the extension of the present reduction DQ method to the transient\nconvection-diffusion equations are also obviously applicable. For the details see reference\n[9].\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCompared with the Galerkin, Control-volume and finite difference methods, the differential\nquadrature method has proved to be a most efficient numerical technique in the calculation\nof the Poisson and convection-diffusion equations [1, 2]. The present work further\nminimizes the computational effort in the DQ solution of these cases. The principal\nadvantages of the matrix approximate formulas are to offer a more compact and convenient\nprocedure for obtaining an explicit matrix formulation and make the DQ method more\nefficient computationally for multi-dimensional problems by means of the existing\ntechniques in the solution of the Lyapunov equations.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgment \u2212We are grateful to an referee whose thorough reviews were very helpful\nin the revision of the original manuscript of the present paper.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
