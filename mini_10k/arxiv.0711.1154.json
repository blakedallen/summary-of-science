The main idea behind Little Higgs is that the Higgs field is a pseudo\nGoldstone boson of an extended global symmetry. This global symmetry is violated by gauge and\nYukawa interactions such that the Higgs field acquires mass from one loop radiative corrections.\nBut now the quadratically divergent contributions are canceled out due to the existence of new\nparticles at TeV scale.\nAmong the realistic realizations of the mechanism behind the Little Higgs the most economical\none is based on the SU (3)L \u2297 U (1)X gauge group. This model is known as the Simplest Little\nHiggs model (SLHM) [2]. Besides recovering the standard particles spectrum, the SLHM predicts\nnew vector gauge bosons, three of them are neutral and one is charged. In the fermion sector,\nthe model has three new quarks, one of them being a heavy top-like quark T . Finally, the scalar\n\n\f2\nsector is composed of two scalar triplets in a non-linear sigma model realization. In this way, after\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, only the standard Higgs and a new pseudo-scalar survive.\nThus, in fact, the physical scalars are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons and their masses generated at one loop level are proportional to the gauge and Yukawa coupling constants times the\nlogarithm of the cutoff \u039b \u2248 4\u03c0f , with f the energy scale related to the global symmetry breakdown\npresent in Little Higgs Models. The new particles in the SLHM have masses related to this scale,\nso that a lower bound on f reflects as a lower bound on these masses. Once the experimental\nsupport to a specific Little Higgs Model does not concern only the Higgs production, but also the\nidentification of a new particle content, such a lower bound for f turns out to be an important\nissue.\nOn the phenomenological side, for example, we have that atomic parity violation in Cesium\nrequires f \u2265 1.7 but the most stringent constraints come from the oblique parameter S due to the\nZ \u2032 which requires f \u2265 5.2 TeV at 95% C.L. [3]. Other important phenomenological constraints on\nLittle Higgs models which are relevant for bounding the f parameter are presented in Ref. [4] by\nconsidering a general analysis of electroweak precision data.\nIt would be interesting to pursue new possibilities of improving the bounds on f and we wish\nto do this by looking at the Z decay width, which is one of the best results from high energy\nprecision experiments. However, if we are to compute the full Z decay width, we should have in\nmind that the SLHM is basically a kind of 3-3-1 model [5], whose quark sector is plagued with\nmixing between ordinary quarks and the heavy new ones [6]. Instead, in this work we are going\nto extract a constraint on the scale f of SLHM from the Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 decay only. It is evident\nthat this particular channel would be cleaner than computing the total decay width, meaning that\nno hadronic current enters in the computation, which turns our approach independent on several\nunknown parameters.\nWe are going to see that this choice turns out to be a little more restrictive than previous ones,\npushing the lower bound on f to about 5.6 TeV. Also, by looking at the minimum of the scalar\npotential we are able to determine the range of values for the \u03bc scale and the k factor, which relates\nthe two scalar triplets vacuum expectation values (VEV)s, f1 and f2 , defining the acceptable range\nof values for the Higgs mass.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE SLHM MINIMAL CONTENT\n\nHere we resume the model used in this work [2]. The model is constructed from a global\nSU(3)1 \u00d7SU(3)2 with two scalar triplets: \u03a61 transforming as a triplet of the factor SU(3)1 but as a\nsinglet of the factor SU(3)2 and \u03a62 transforming as a triplet of the factor SU(3)2 but as a singlet of\nthe factor SU(3)1 . This global symmetry is spontaneously broken, at a scale f , to SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2\nby the scalar VEVs. It results in ten Nambu-Goldsone bosons which could be described as a nonlinear sigma model SU(3)1 \u00d7SU(3)2 /SU(2)1 \u00d7SU(2)2 , if the radial modes are assumed to get mass\nabove the f scale. Therefore, when the diagonal subgroup SU (3)W \u00d7U (1)X of the global symmetry\nis turned into a gauge symmetry, the scalar fields break the gauge group to the Standard Model\n(SM) SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y group at the scale f . Five of the ten degrees of freedom associated with\nthe Nambu-Goldstone bosons are absorbed into the longitudinal components of the new gauge\nbosons, which turn them massive at this scale. The remaining degrees of freedom in the scalar\ntriplets stay massless at tree level but become massive as a result of the radiative corrections. This\nhappens because introduction of the gauge and Yukawa interactions breaks explicitly the global\nSU(3)1 \u00d7SU(3)2 symmetry. Thus, in fact, the physical scalars are pseudo Nambu-Goldsone bosons\nand their masses, generated at one loop level, are proportional to the gauge and Yukawa coupling\nconstants times the logarithm of the cutoff \u039b.\nIn the non-linear description, the scalar triplets, which transform as \u223c (3 , \u22121/3) under\nSU (3)W \u00d7 U (1)X , can be parameterized as\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0398 ~\nf1 ,\n\u03a61 = exp i\nkf\nWhere we define, k =\n\nf1\nf2 ,\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\nk\u0398 ~\n\u03a62 = exp \u2212i\nf2 ,\nf\n\n(1)\n\nthe scale f 2 = f12 +f22 and the vacuum direction is assumed f~i = (0 0 fi )T ,\n\nwith T meaning transposition; \u0398 is the matrix\n\uf8ee \u221a\n\uf8f9\n\u2212 42 \u03b7\n0\nh0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u221a\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u0398=\uf8ef 0\n(2)\n\u2212 42 \u03b7 h\u2212 \uf8fa ,\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\u221a\n2\nh0\u2217\nh+\n2 \u03b7\n\u0001T\nh0 and h\u2212 form a doublet under SU (2)L , h = h0 , h\u2212 , which is identified with the standard\nmodel Higgs doublet and \u03b7 is a pseudo-scalar singlet field.\n\nThe SLHM have the minimal lepton content composed according to the following representations\nof SU(3)L \u2297 U(1)X\nLaL = \u03bda ea \u03bdaC\neaR \u223c (1, \u22121),\n\n\u0001T\n\nL\n\n\u223c (3 , \u22121/3) ,\n(3)\n\n\f4\nwhere a = 1, 2, 3. Right-handed singlet neutrinos can also be added but they are irrelevant for\nour present purposes.\nThe quarks can be chosen as composing the following representations: \u03a8Q1 = (d u D)TL\nand \u03a8Q2 = (s c S)TL both transforming as \u223c (3\u2217 , 0), and \u03a8Q3 = (t b T )TL transforming as\n\u223c (3, 1/3); with the right-handed components uR , cR , tR , TR transforming as \u223c (1, 2/3); and\ndR , sR , bR , DR , SR transforming as \u223c (1, \u22121/3). The new heavy quarks are D, S, and T which,\naccording to the global symmetry of the little Higgs model, cancel out one loop quadratic divergences for the Higgs mass due to d, s and t quarks. This choice for the quark representations is\nspecial in the sense that anomalies cancellation involves the three fermion generations altogether\n[5]. In fact, the dominant contribution coming from fermions for the effective potential is due to\nthe top quark and its heavy partner in the third generation. This is because the known quarks\nare too light compared to the top quark. With the scalar triplets in Eq. (1) transforming as\n\u03a61 ,\u03a62 \u223c (3, \u22121/3), the relevant Yukawa interactions to compute the effective potential are then\nLq = \u03bbt1 \u03a8Q3 \u03a61 tR + \u03bbt2 \u03a8Q3 \u03a62 TR + h.c.\n\n(4)\n\nThe Yukawa couplings are taken to be diagonal, avoiding crossed terms such as \u03a8Q3 \u03a61 TR in order\nto simplify the analysis.\nAs we have said, the little Higgs mechanism is such that the tree level interaction violating\nthe global symmetry, like that in Eq. (4), generates an effective potential for the Higgs field so\nthat it has a nontrivial VEV, hhi = (v , 0)T . Thus, the reduction of the SM group down to the\nelectromagnetic group is dynamically induced following the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism [7].\nAs it happens, when a gauge symmetry larger than the SM one is assumed, and supposing that\nit is spontaneously broken at the scale f > v, the couplings of the fields representing the known\ngauge bosons, Z and W \u00b1 , deviate by terms proportional to v 2 /f 2 from those predicted at the tree\nlevel by the SM [8].\nOur aim is to extract the leptonic Z boson couplings up to order v 2 /f 2 to constrain this ratio\nthrough Z decay into leptons. The Z decay into neutrinos is not so restrictive as the decay in\ncharged leptons. The reason is that the axial-vector neutrino coupling receives a v 2 /f 2 correction\nwhich is suppressed by other factors and, more importantly, the invisible width \u0393Z\u2192\u03bd\u03bd is not as\nprecise as \u0393Z\u2192l+ l\u2212 .\nTo obtain the masses and the eigenstates of the gauge bosons the following parameterization\n\n\f5\nfor the VEVs is used:\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015T\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\nv\nkf\nv\n,\n0 cos\nh\u03a61 i = \u221a\ni sin\n2\nkf\nkf\n1+k\nh\u03a62 i = \u221a\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015T\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\nkv\nf\nkv\n,\n0 cos\n\u2212i sin\n2\nf\nf\n1+k\n\n(5)\n\nwith v being the VEV of the neutral scalar h0 .\nThe gauge boson masses are obtained from the kinetic terms for the scalar fields \u03a6i ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\ni\na a\nL = | \u2202\u03bc \u2212 gW\u03bc T + gX B\u03bc \u03a6i |2 ,\n2\n3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere T a represents a generator of the gauge group SU (3)W , with a = 1...8; B\u03bc is the gauge boson\nassociated to the abelian gauge group U (1)X .\nAmong the neutral vector bosons, besides the photon A\u03bc , there will be three massive states\ncalled Z1\u03bc , Z2\u03bc and U\u03bc0 , which are linear combinations of the symmetry fields W3\u03bc , W8\u03bc , B\u03bc and\nW5\u03bc , and a fourth massive state which decouples from the other states and is identical to its own\nsymmetry eigenstate W4\u03bc . The structure of the VEVs required by the little Higgs mechanism is\nclearly distinct, concerning the gauge bosons, compared with some well known SU (3)W \u00d7 U (1)X\nmodels.

[10]. We observe\nthat these eigenvalues are invariant by the change k \u2192 1/k. This symmetry is nothing more than\nthe fact that the gauge interactions do not distinguish one scalar triplet from the other, i. e., there\nis no physical effect in performing the change f1 \u2194 f2 . In fact, the effective potential exhibits such\n\na symmetry once it depends only on |\u03a61 |2 |\u03a62 |2 \u2212|\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2 . Another point which should be mentioned\n\nconcerns this invariance in the limit k \u2192 0 (or equivalently k \u2192 \u221e) keeping the ratio v/f fixed.\nIt leads to \u03b4Z \u2192 0 so that spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y does not occur in\nthis limit, once the Higgs potential goes, in this case, to zero. Thus, the particle masses show a\ndependence on the k parameter and these masses can be sensitive to this parameter even when the\nratio v/f is small. Actually, this is an interesting fact since masses at the electroweak scale cannot\nbe free from the high energy physics as we expect, if all low energy parameters originate from a\nprevious structure of a more fundamental underlying theory.\nThe neutral vector bosons eigenstates, in the basis W3 , W8 , B and W5 , are\n\nZ\u03bc1 =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nc3 W\u03bc3 + c8 W\u03bc8 + cB B\u03bc + c5 W\u03bc5 ,\nNz1\n\n(16)\n\n\f7\nwhere\nc3 = 2a(3 + 4t2 ) \u2212 4(t2 + 3) + 9m2z1 ,\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003\nc8 = 3 2a(3 + 4t2 ) \u2212 4t2 \u2212 3m2z1 ,\n\ncB = 12t(1 \u2212 m2z1 ),\nc5 = \u22124u(3 + 4t2 ).\nWith the normalization factor Nz1 =\n\nq\n\n(17)\n\nc23 + c28 + c2B + c25 and m2z1 = 2MZ2 1 /g2 f 2 .\n\nThe expansion of Z 1 above is sufficient for our purposes, and we can do the same for the other\nmass eigenstates,\nZ\u03bc2 =\nwhere\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nd3 W\u03bc3 + d8 W\u03bc8 + dB B\u03bc + d5 W\u03bc5 ,\nNz2\n\n(18)\n\nd3 = 2a(3 + 4t2 ) \u2212 4(t2 + 3) + 9m2z2 ,\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003\nd8 = 3 2a(3 + 4t2 ) \u2212 4t2 \u2212 3m2z2 ,\n\ndB = 12t(1 \u2212 m2z2 ),\nd5 = \u22124u(3 + 4t2 ).\n\n(19)\n\nFor the third neutral massive vector boson and the photon we have\n\nand\n\nU\u03bc0 = p\n\n1\n4u2 + (2a \u2212 1)2\n\nA\u03bc = \u221a\n\nh\n\nuW\u03bc3 +\n\n\u221a\n\n3uW\u03bc8 + (2a \u2212 1)W\u03bc5\n\nh\u221a\ni\n\u221a\n1\n3tW\u03bc3 \u2212 tW\u03bc8 + 3B\u03bc ,\n3 + 4t2\n\ni\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\nrespectively.\nWe can then extract the vector and axial-vector couplings of neutral gauge bosons with leptons,\ngV and gA , by considering the above eigenstates and the associated interaction Lagrangian.

The parameter \u03bal embodies the radiative corrections that\nmodify the Weinberg mixing angle, yielding the so called effective angle, s2W (ef f ) \u2261 \u03bal s2W . Then,\nl are given by the same expression as\nin Eq. (24), the vector and axial-vector couplings \u1e21Vl and \u1e21A\n\nin Eq. (23) but with s2W replaced by s2W (ef f ) . The term \u03b4\u03c1 is the deviation from SM prediction for\nthe \u03c1 parameter, \u03c1 \u2261 MZ1 cW /MW = 1 + \u03b4\u03c1, taking into account contributions of the gauge group\nstructure of SLHM only.

These parameters can be used to obtain the\nform factors for the decay Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 using the Zfitter package [12], yielding\n\u03b4\u03c1e = 0.00531\n\n(28)\n\ns2w(ef f ) = 0.2315\n\n(29)\n\nand\n\nwhich translates into \u03bae = 1.0367. Plugging these parameters into Eq. (24) together with the limit\nf \u2192 \u221e and \u03b4\u03c1 \u2192 0, we obtain the standard model prediction \u0393(Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) = 83.99 MeV. This\nvalue perfectly reproduces the fit reported in the Particle Data Group (PDG) [11].\nHowever, the experimentally observed partial decay width for this channel, according to LEP-II\nresults is \u0393(Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) = 83.91 \u00b1 0.12 MeV [11], leaving much room for new physics. We can take\nadvantage of this window in order to get a better bound on the f scale in SLHM.\nNow let us obtain the constraint over f . The new contributions to the Z1 decay width concern\nthe modifications on the vector and axial-vector couplings, presented in Eq. (23) for a finite f , as\nwell as the SLHM contribution to the \u03c1 parameter given by Eq. (26). Considering the experimental\nresult within 95% of C.L., we are able to obtain the lower bound\nf \u2265 5.6 TeV,\n\n(30)\n\nfrom the highest value \u0393(Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) = 84.145 MeV. This bound is stronger than the one obtained\nsolely from the \u03c1 parameter [2], and represents a small improvement with respect to that obtained\nthrough oblique corrections [3].\nThe effects of this constraint in the gauge boson sector translate in lower bounds on the masses\nof the new gauge bosons. Keeping only the dominant terms in Eqs. (12) and (13)\nMZ2 \u2265 3160 GeV , and MU 0 \u2265 2600 GeV.\n\n(31)\n\nThere is also a new charged gauge boson, W \u2032 , whose mass at first order is such that MW \u2032 \u2248\n\u221a\nMU 0 = gf / 2. Therefore, we can conclude that production of new gauge bosons in this model\nwill not be possible even at the LHC, where it is expected an energy around 1 TeV for each quark\ncarried by the protons.\nAnother distinguished particle in this model is the exotic quark, T , partner of the top quark.\nIt was observed that the minimum value for the T quark mass would be [2]\n\n\f10\n\n\u221a mt kf\n11k\nMT = 2 2\n\u2248\nTeV,\n2\nv 1+k\n1 + k2\n\n(32)\n\nwith the top quark mass taken as mt \u2248 175 GeV. A rough estimate of energy available for particle\nproduction at LHC is that each quark in the pp reaction carries one TeV. Therefore, MT could\nbe inside the potential available energy for production in LHC if k \u2264 0.2 or, equivalently, k \u2265 5\nwhich corresponds to a mass MT \u2264 2 TeV. The prospects for observing the T quark at forthcoming\ncolliders as well as the singlet scalar, characteristic of Little Higgs models, is analyzed in Refs. [14],\n[15], [16].\n\nIV.\n\nHIGGS MASS\n\nIn this model the Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson related to the spontaneous breaking of\nthe SU (3)1 \u00d7 SU (3)2 global symmetry, which is also explicitly broken, resulting in a mass for the\nHiggs boson. However in order to generate an acceptable value for the scale f , we have to include\na scale in the potential through the term \"\u03bc2 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 \". Gauge and Yukawa interactions break the\nglobal symmetry and then provide a potential for the standard Higgs boson. At one-loop, and\nkeeping only dominant terms involving the Higgs field to the fourth power, this potential is the\nfollowing [2],\n\nVh =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bc2 k 3\n1\n\u03bc2 (1 + k2 )\n2\n\u2020\n+m h h+ \u2212\n+ \u03bb (h\u2020 h)2 ,\nk\n12 f 2 (1 + k2 )3\n\n(33)\n\nwith\n\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012 2\u0013\n3\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\ng2 2\ng2 2\n2\n2\nm =\u2212\n2\u03bbt MT ln\n\u2212 MW \u2032 ln\n,\n\u2212 MZ \u2032 ln\n2\n2\n2\n2\n16\u03c0\n4\n2\nMT\nMZ \u2032\nMW\n\u2032\n2\n\n(34)\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm2Z\nm2t\n3\n1\nm2 (1 + k2 )2\n4 1\n4\n+ ln 2 \u2212 mZ\n+ ln 2\n\u2212\n4mt\n\u03bb = \u2212\n3f 2 k2\n64\u03c0 2 v 4\n2\n2\nMT\nMZ \u2032\n\u22122m4W\n\n\u0012\n\nm2\n1\n+ ln W\n2\n2\nMW\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n\u03bbt and g are the top quark Yukawa and SU(2) gauge coupling constants, respectively.\nOnce the scale f is constrained according to Eq. (30) the physical condition that the true\nvacuum lies on the minimum of the potential leads to a relation involving \u03bc and k, which is\n\n\f11\n\nv 2 \u03bb + m2\n\n2\n\n\u03bc =\u0010\n\nv2 (1+k 2 )3\n12k 3 f 2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\n(1+k 2 )\nk\n\n\u0011.\n\n(36)\n\nObserve that in this equation, \u03bb and m2 depend only on two free parameters, f and k (see Eq. (34)\nand Eq. (35) above). We plot \u03bc as a function of k for the relevant range 5.6 TeV < f < 10 TeV\nas shown in Fig. 1. From this figure we see that k = 1 yields the highest values for \u03bc, starting\nfrom 1.5 TeV. For a soft natural breaking of the global symmetry we would expect \u03bc \u2248 250 GeV,\na value that can be obtained for k \u2264 0.14 or, equivalently, k \u2265 7.\nThe Higgs mass derived from Eq. (33) is given by\n\nmh = 2v\n\ns\n\n\u03bb\u2212\n\n\u03bc2 k 3\n1\n.\n12 f 2 (1 + k2 )3\n\n(37)\n\nThis Higgs mass is plotted against k in Fig. 2 and, as before, we have included three sample curves\nfor f = 5.6, 7 and 10 TeV. Observe that for an interval surrounding k = 2 there is no significant\nchange in mh (k), even for values of f higher than the bound derived in Eq. (30). Considering the\nLEP limit mh \u2265 114 GeV the restriction 0.105 \u2264 k \u2264 9.5 is obtained. Large values for f require\nhigher values for \u03bc in order to satisfy the constraint in Eq. (36). This is a fine tunning situation\nwhich is not so severe as in the SM where, apparently, an adjustment has to be done to suppress a\nscale, \u039bcutof f \u2248 MP l , near the Planck mass until the electroweak scale. Here we have \u039b \u2248 70 TeV.\nNotice also that, from Fig. 2, even for a scale f = 10 GeV the Higgs mass would be such that\nmh (k) < 200 GeV, which settles the maximum Higgs mass on the appropriate scale to be reached\nby LHC, whatever the value of f in the considered range. On the other hand the exotic T quark\ncould be produced at LHC only for a small range of the k parameter, i. e. 0.105 \u2264 k \u2264 0.2, or for\nk \u2265 5.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe show here that the Z 0 width for charged leptons requires f \u2265 5.6 TeV, which represents an\nimprovement on the f bounds [3]. Moreover, it implies a mass spectrum for the new gauge bosons\nin SLHM, Z2 , U 0 and W \u2032 , that is mostly out of the LHC capability for their direct detection.\nNevertheless, if the k parameter is in the appropriate range, although very restricted as mentioned\nabove, the new heavy quark T can be produced at LHC and becomes a genuine signal of this SLHM.\nBut once the new gauge bosons of this model cannot be produced in the present machines, only\n\n\f12\n\n\u039c@kD\n3000\n2500\n2000\n1500\n1000\n500\nk\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: The \u03bc parameter as a function of k.

Starting from below, the curves are for f = 5.6, 7 and 10 TeV,\nrespectively. The symmetry k \u2192 1/k is manifest.\n\nthe production of T quark is not sufficient to distinguish the SLHM from its viable competitors\n(see Ref. [16] for a proposal to discriminate between Little Higgs models based in product group\nand simple group). In fact, there are two additional exotic quarks, D and S, which cancel the one\nloop quadratic divergences in Higgs mass due to d and s quarks. Considering also the hypothesis\nof producing D and S exotic quarks, more work would be needed to distinguish the model we treat\nhere from the known 3-3-1 models.\nIt is fair to say that the option for using the Little Higgs idea for solving the (little) hierarchy\nproblem could be criticized from a naturalness point of view. Indeed, there are studies concerning\nthe amount of fine-tunning required by some known Little Higgs models [17]. In ref. [17] the\nauthors conclude that, for scales f \u2243 1 TeV, the SLHM could be made the best behaved model\nunder the fine-tunning analysis, but with a restricted region in the parameter space, where it is\n\n\f13\ncompetitive with supersymmetric models. An analysis for fine-tunning involving all parameters\nand taking into account the constraint we present here for the scale f , would be necessary. This\nwould give us the regions in the parameter space where SLHM could be considered viable under\nthis point of view.\nAcknowledgments: The authors acknowledge the support of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo Research\nFoundation (FAPESP), A.
