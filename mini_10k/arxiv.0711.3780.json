INTRODUCTION\n\nAnomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gammaray repeaters (SGRs) are young neutron stars (NSs)\nwith rotation period of 2\u201312 s and inferred surface magnetic field strength B \u2248 1014\u221215 G. See\nWoods & Thompson (2006) and Kaspi (2007) for recent\nreviews. In the magnetar model (Duncan & Thompson\n1992; Thompson & Duncan 1995, 1996), the rearrangement and decay of their extreme fields is responsible\nfor their large and variable X-ray luminosity, which\nexceeds that available from rotational braking. Thirteen magnetars are confirmed4 , of which the AXP\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 is the most recent. Discovered with the\nEinstein X-ray satellite in 1980 (Lamb & Markert 1981),\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 was identified as a magnetar candidate\nin the center of the small candidate SNR G327.24\u22120.13\nby Gelfand & Gaensler (2007). It was subsequently observed to be emitting radio pulsations at a period of\nP = 2 s (Camilo et al. 2007b), with spin-down properties\nof a magnetar (\u1e56 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 , B = 2.2 \u00d7 1014 G), and\na distance estimate of 9 kpc from its dispersion measure\n(DM). 1E 1547.0\u22125408 (PSR J1550\u22125418) and the 5.5 s\nAXP XTE J1810\u2212197 are the only magnetars known to\nemit in the radio (Camilo et al. 2006).

Radio pulsar coverage was also obtained at the same time as\none of the X-ray observations, and the phase relationship\nof the radio and X-ray pulse was determined.\n2. X-RAY OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. Swift\n\nFollowing the detection of radio pulsations from\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 on 2007 June 8, seven observations\nwere made with the Swift X-ray telescope (XRT;\nGehrels et al. 2004; Burrows et al. 2005) between 2007\nJune 22 and July 30. The data were taken in photon\ncounting mode, which provides imaging with 18\u2032\u2032 halfpower diameter resolution and 2.5 s time sampling. Neither the counts nor the time resolution were sufficient to\ndetect pulsations. We used the archived event files with\nstandard screening criteria applied. A total of 22.4 ks\nof exposure was obtained, although 2.6 ks of this had\nincorrect attitude solution; the latter was not used for\nspectral analysis. The source was detected in the range\n1\u20138 keV with an initial count rate of 0.095 s\u22121 , and a systematic decrease of about 30% over the 40 day interval\n(see Fig. 1). The seven Swift observations were summed\nin order to accumulate sufficient statistics for a useful\nspectral fit. The spectral modeling is discussed in \u00a73.\nThe maximum observed flux,\n\u2248\n5.2 \u00d7\n10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 1\u20138 keV band on 2007\nJune 22, is 16 times greater than the minimum seen\nin 2006 July\u2013August, and 2.6 times greater than the\n\n\f2\n\nHALPERN ET AL.\n\nFig. 1.- Absorbed, 1 \u2212 8 keV X-ray flux of 1E 1547.0\u22125408\nbeginning on 2007 June 22 from the Swift XRT (filled circles) and\nincluding XMM-Newton on 2007 August 9 (open circle). The solid\nline is fitted only to the early Swift points. The dashed line indicates the minimum historical flux level, which was seen by Chandra\nand XMM-Newton in 2006 July and August (Gelfand & Gaensler\n2007, and Table 1).\n\nprevious highest flux (Gelfand & Gaensler 2007). The\nsmall dynamic range of the data in Figure 1 prevents\na characterization of the decay curve, whether linear,\nexponential, or power law. Additional observations were\nmade by Swift on 2007 September 28 \u2013 October 1, after\na 2 month gap caused by a gyroscope anomaly, and\nfinally on October 26. These show the flux leveling off\nand possibly rising again. The proximity of the Sun\nprevents further observations until early 2008.\n2.2. XMM-Newton\n\nThe results of all archival X-ray observations of\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 were published by Gelfand & Gaensler\n(2007). Here, we reanalyze their long (46 ks) XMMNewton observation of 2006 August 21, which found the\nsource in its lowest observed state, in order to compare the components of its X-ray spectrum with the\nhigh state and to make a more sensitive search for pulsations at the now known period. We reprocessed the\nobservation data files using the emchain and epchain\nscripts under Science Analysis System (SAS) version\nxmmsas 20060628 1801-7.0.0. The 73.4 ms sampling of\nthe European Photon Imaging Camera pn CCD (EPIC\npn; Turner et al. 2003) in \"full frame\" mode was adequate to search for pulsations from 1E 1547.0\u22125408.\nThe 0.9 s sampling of the two EPIC MOS cameras, operated in \"large window\" mode, is close to the Nyquist\nfrequency for the 2 s pulsar.\nOn 2007 August 9 we obtained a new XMM-Newton\nobservation. The exposure time was 4.2 hr in the EPIC\npn and 4.6 hr in the EPIC MOS. The pn CCD was operated in \"large window\" mode, with 48 ms sampling.\nThe two MOS CCDs were operated in \"small window\"\nmode, with time sampling of 0.3 s, in order to be used to\nstudy the pulsed light curve. We processed the data using the SAS version mentioned above. This observation\ncame 10 days after a string of Swift observations, and\nits flux falls on the linear decay fitted to the prior Swift\npoints (see Fig. 1). Spectral fitting of the XMM-Newton\nobservations is discussed in \u00a73 and timing analysis for\npulsations in \u00a74.\n\nFig. 2.- Spectra of 1E 1547.0\u22125408 from the XMM-Newton observation of 2007 August 9, showing EPIC pn and MOS separately,\nand the summed Swift XRT observations from 2007 June 22 \u2013 July\n30. The fit is to the Comptonized blackbody model described in\nthe text, with parameters listed in Table 1.\n\n3. X-RAY SPECTRAL FITTING\n\nWe first tried fitting a single blackbody to the spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift . A single blackbody is an inadequate fit in either high or low states.\nIt leaves a deficit of flux at 1 keV, and an excess at\nthe highest energies, > 5 keV. The low-energy end of\nthe spectrum may be affected by an unmodeled proton cyclotron absorption line, of resonance energy Ec =\n0.63(1+z)\u22121(B/1014 G) keV, where z is the gravitational\nredshift and (1 + z) = (1 \u2212 2GM/c2 R)\u22121/2 \u2248 1.3. For\nB = 2.2 \u00d7 1014 G, the line would appear at \u2248 1 keV.\nHowever, there is not enough coverage of the continuum\nat low energies to model it.\nSimilarly, the high-energy end of the spectrum is\npoorly characterized. However, we can fit the highenergy excess with a simple Comptonization model that\nintroduces only one additional parameter. In this model,\nsurface thermal photons are multiply scattered by relativistic electrons of mean energy \u03b3mc2 and optical depth\n\u03c4es (Pozdnyakov et al. 1976; Rybicki & Lightman 1979).\nThe mean energy boost factor per scattering is A =\n4h\u03b3 2 i/3. In the limit \u03c4es < 1, an analytic approximation\nfor the spectrum can be derived that is a function only\nof the surface blackbody temperature TBB and the combined scattering parameter \u03b1 = \u2212ln\u03c4es /lnA. The scattered spectrum resembles the original blackbody, plus\na tail that at high energies approaches a power law of\nphoton index \u0393 = 2 + \u03b1. This model was also used by\nTiengo et al. (2005) to fit spectra of another AXP, although they derived (in our notation) \u0393 = 1 + \u03b1.\nWhile this approach neglects effects of the magnetic field, which are treated by the more realistic resonant cyclotron scattering model (Lyutikov & Gavriil\n2006; Fern\u00e1ndez & Thompson 2007; Rea et al. 2007a;\nG\u00fcver et al. 2007), the effects on the spectrum are similar, and our Comptonized blackbody model is in fact\nequivalent to equation (58) of Fern\u00e1ndez & Thompson\n(2007), which they used to fit their own Monte Carlo\nspectral results. Either scattering model is more meaningful than the \"traditional\" pure power-law plus blackbody fit, because there is no physical mechanism that\n\n\fOUTBURST OF AXP 1E 1547.0\u22125408\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1\nComptonized Blackbody Spectral Fits\n\nParameter\nNH (1022 cm\u22122 ) . . . .\nkTBB (keV) . . . . . . . . .\n\u03b1. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nABB (cm2 ) . . . . . . . . . .\nF (ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 )a .\nLBB (1034 ergs s\u22121 )b\nLtot (1034 ergs s\u22121 )c\n\u03c72\u03bd (\u03bd) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2006 Aug 21\nXMM-Newton\n\n2007 Jun 22\u2013Jul 30\nSwift average\n\n2007 Aug 9\nXMM-Newton\n\n2.84 \u00b1 0.60\n0.40 \u00b1 0.06\n2.10+0.76\n\u22120.38\n3.6 \u00d7 1011\n3.3 \u00d7 10\u221213\n0.95\n1.39\n0.99(117)\n\n3.12 (fixed)\n0.50 \u00b1 0.03\n2.93 (fixed)\n17.6 \u00d7 1011\n4.6 \u00d7 10\u221212\n11.3\n15.2\n1.1(27)\n\n3.12 \u00b1 0.23\n0.52 \u00b1 0.03\n2.93+0.97\n\u22120.48\n9.6 \u00d7 1011\n3.2 \u00d7 10\u221212\n7.2\n9.7\n0.77(252)\n\nNote. - Uncertainties are 90% confidence intervals for three interesting parameters.\nLuminosities and areas are computed for d = 9 kpc, assuming isotropic flux.\nAbsorbed flux in the 1 \u2212 10 keV band.\nUnabsorbed, bolometric blackbody luminosity.\nUnabsorbed total luminosity including Comptonized component.\n\na\nb\nc\n\nextends such a power law to photon energies less than\nthe seed blackbody photons.\nThe results of spectral fitting are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2. Acceptable values of \u03c72 and reasonably small errors on the three fitting parameters\nNH , kTBB , and \u03b1 were obtained from both XMM-Newton\nobservations. In the case of Swift , where fewer photons\nwere collected, we could obtain a small error on kTBB ,\nbut \u03b1 was not constrained. We therefore fixed NH and\n\u03b1 in the fitting of the Swift spectrum to their nearly\ncontemporaneous values measured by XMM-Newton in\n2007.\nFrom the average Swift spectrum of 2007 June\u2013\nJuly, most of the flux is fitted by a blackbody whose\nbolometric luminosity is LBB \u2248 1.1 \u00d7 1035 (d/9 kpc)2\nergs s\u22121 , and the corresponding area is ABB \u2248 1.8 \u00d7\n1012 (d/9 kpc)2 cm2 , or \u223c 14% of the NS surface. In\naddition, there is a Compton scattered component of\nLs \u2248 3.9 \u00d7 1034 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 . Together, these\ncomponents account for the total luminosity Ltot \u2248\n1.5 \u00d7 1035 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 in Table 1. Relative to\nthese averages of 2007 June\u2013July, the maximum luminosity and area recorded by the first Swift observation\nof 2007 June 22 are \u2248 13% higher, i.e., LBB,max \u2248\n1.3 \u00d7 1035 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 , ABB,max /ANS \u2248 0.16, and\nLs,max \u2248 4.4 \u00d7 1034 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 . Smaller values are then obtained from the subsequent XMM-Newton\nobservation on 2007 August 9, which, within the errors,\nare consistent with a decrease of the blackbody area at a\nconstant temperature. We fitted individual Swift observations to look for more subtle changes in spectral shape.\nWithin the larger uncertainties of the individual spectra,\nthere is no evidence for spectral changes from 2007 June\n22 through October 26.\nThe XMM-Newton and Swift spectra from 2006 August and 2007 June, respectively, show that a combination of the increase in the blackbody temperature from\n0.4 keV to 0.5 keV and an increase of the area of that hot\nregion by a factor of 5 is primarily responsible for the dramatic increase in X-ray flux. There is no evidence for a\nmajor change in the efficiency of magnetospheric scattering between the two states, as the scattering parameter\n\u03b1 remained the same to within errors. Only 26 \u2212 32% of\nthe X-ray luminosity is in the Compton scattered component in any state, as can be seen by comparing Ltot\n\nand LBB in Table 1.\n4. X-RAY PULSATIONS\n\nOnly\nthe\nXMM-Newton\nobservations\nof\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 have sufficient photon statistics\nand time resolution to search for pulsations. The event\ntimes were converted to Barycentric Dynamical Time\n(TDB) using the precise position of the pulsar, (J2000)\nR.A. = 15h 50m 54.11s \u00b1 0.01s , Decl. \u221254\u25e6 18\u2032 23.7\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 0.1\u2032\u2032\n(Camilo et al. 2007b). Events were extracted from the\n2007 August XMM-Newton observation in a 30\u2032\u2032 radius\naround the source in the EPIC pn CCD, and 25\u2032\u2032 in\nthe MOS CCDs. Photons in the range 0.5 \u2212 8 keV\nfrom the three detectors were combined, and searched\nfor pulsations using the Zn2 test. A signal was found\nconsistent with the contemporaneous radio period\nwith Z12 = 33.9, Z22 = 40.7, and Z32 = 43.4. The Z12\npower spectrum is shown in Figure 3. These values\ncorrespond to a chance probability of \u223c 10\u22127 . The\npower contributed by the harmonics is indicative of a\npulse that is narrower than a sinusoid. From the Z32\nsearch, we derive P = 2.069961(17) s (1\u03c3), compared\nwith P = 2.0699348(5) s in the radio (see \u00a75).\nFigure 3 also shows the 1 \u2212 6 keV X-ray pulse folded\nat the exact radio period (determined in \u00a75). We note\nthat, while the 48 ms time sampling of the pn is more\nthan sufficient to resolve the pulse, the 0.3 s sampling of\nthe MOS also adequately resolves the observed structure.\nThe X-rays are weakly modulated with pulsed amplitude\n\u223c 7%, defined as the fraction of total counts above the\nminimum of the light curve. This is small compared to\nmost AXPs, and comparable only to the small amplitude\nof 4U 0142+614 (Rea et al. 2007b; Gonzalez et al. 2007).\nThe latter has a complex pulse shape, which is energy\ndependent as well as varying with luminosity. Within\nthe limited statistics available for 1E 1547.0\u22125408, we\ndo not have evidence for energy dependence of its pulse\nshape.\nA search of the 2006 August 21 XMM-Newton observation of 1E 1547.0\u22125408 at the extrapolated radio period\nwas less sensitive because (1) the source was in a low\nflux state at the time, (2) the 0.9 s sampling of the MOS\ndetectors in large window mode is close to the Nyquist\nfrequency, and (3) the lack of a contemporaneous radio\nephemeris required a search over several dozen independent trial periods. The latter is especially problematic, as\n\n\f4\n\nHALPERN ET AL.\n\nFig. 3.- Z12 power spectra of the combined XMM-Newton\nEPIC pn and MOS observations of 1E 1547.0\u22125408. The reference frequency, 0.4831049 Hz, is the radio measured value on\n2007 August 9. The range of frequencies searched corresponds to\n\u1e56 \u2264 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 between the two epochs, or \u2264 12 times the discovery value. The highest peak on 2006 August 21, if real, requires\nan average \u1e56 = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221211 between the two epochs. Insets: Xray pulse profiles in the optimal 1 \u2212 6 keV band, normalized to\na mean count rate of 1. Background has been subtracted from\nnearby regions of the CCD. The 2006 August 21 profile is from the\nEPIC pn only, while the 2007 August 9 profile is from the EPIC\npn and MOS. Phase zero of the 2006 August 21 profile is arbitrary.\nThe 2007 August 9 profile is folded on the contemporaneous radio\nephemeris (see Fig. 4).\n\nthe period derivative of a magnetar can vary by a factor\nof several on a timescale of 1 year (e.g., Gavriil & Kaspi\n2004). Allowing for 0 < \u1e56 < 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 , up to 12 times\nits discovery value of 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 (Camilo et al. 2007b),\nrequires a search of \u2248 160 independent periods in the\n2006 August observation of 1E 1547.0\u22125408.\nWe extracted events from an optimized radius of 20\u2032\u2032\naround the source in the 2006 August EPIC pn image,\nand applied the Z12 test. The 1 \u2212 6 keV band was chosen\nto optimize the signal-to-noise. The strongest signal in\nthe \u1e56 search range described above yielded Z12 = 18.1\nand corresponds to \u1e56 = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221211 , which is close to its\n2007 June value of \u1e56 = 2.3\u00d710\u221211 , and even closer to the\nlatest value from continued radio timing, \u1e56 = 2.9\u00d710\u221211\n(F. Camilo et al., in preparation). The light curve folded\nat the corresponding period of 2.069067(12) s is quasisinusoidal with a pulsed fraction of \u2248 15% (see Fig. 3).\nThe overall statistical significance of this signal is difficult to estimate because the range of \u1e56 considered is\nsomewhat arbitrary, but it is probably 98\u201399%. When\nwe add the source photons from the MOS detectors to\n\nFig. 4.- Alignment of the simultaneously observed radio and\nX-ray pulses on 2007 August 9, folded at 0.4831049 Hz. Phase\nzero corresponds to MJD 54321.44 TDB. The radio (DFB) total\nintensity profile is displayed in 512 bins, and the small feature at\nphase \u2248 0.63 is real, also being present in analog filterbank data.\n\nthe search, Z12 increases to 24.0 (see Fig. 3), which is encouraging of the reality of the signal, as its significance\nrises to \u2248 99.9% while the period remains consistent,\nP = 2.069059(10) s. Therefore, we consider this a tentative detection of pulsations on 2006 August 21.\n5. CONTEMPORANEOUS RADIO PULSAR OBSERVATION\n\nWe observed 1E 1547.0\u22125408 with the Parkes telescope in Australia on 2007 August 9, overlapping with\nthe XMM-Newton observation. We collected data for\n4.3 hr beginning at 09:57 UT, 16 min before the start\nof the X-ray observation. We used the central beam\nof the methanol multibeam receiver and recorded data\nusing two different spectrometers. With an analog filterbank, we sampled a bandwidth of 576 MHz centered\non 6.6 GHz. Each of 192 polarization-summed frequency\nchannels was sampled every 1 ms with one-bit precision.\nIn parallel, we operated a digital filterbank (DFB) with a\nbandwidth of 256 MHz centered on 6.4 GHz, which folded\nthe data into 2048-bin (1 ms resolution) profiles in all\nStokes parameters.\nWe analyzed the data in standard fashion using the\nPRESTO, TEMPO, and PSRCHIVE packages. The pulsar was detected at P = 2.0699438(5) s on MJD 54321.44.\nIn order to compare the radio and X-ray light curves\nin absolute phase, radio pulse times-of-arrival were converted to TDB using TEMPO, and corrected to infinite\nfrequency using the measured DM = 830 \u00b1 50 cm\u22123 pc\n\n\fOUTBURST OF AXP 1E 1547.0\u22125408\n\n5\n\n(2007) assuming an association with two nearby star\nforming regions with H I measured distances. This\nsmaller distance estimate would place PSR J1550\u22125418\nin or near the Crux\u2013Scutum spiral arm, while d = 9 kpc\nwould be compatible with a location near the Norma\nspiral arm. At d \u2248 4 kpc, the X-ray luminosities and\nblackbody areas in Table 1 would be smaller by a factor\nof 5.\nThe Galactic longitude of PSR J1550\u22125418, 327.24\u25e6,\nfalls on the tangent of our line of sight to the Norma spiral arm as mapped in CO (see Fig. 9 of Bronfman et al.\n1989), at a distance of 8.5 kpc. In this direction the bulk\nof the CO lies at radial velocities ranging from \u221235 to\n\u221295 km s\u22121 . If PSR J1550\u22125418 ever becomes much\nbrighter in the radio, an H I absorption study may be\nable to pin down its distance more precisely, since absorption in the Crux-Scutum arm extends only to negative velocities of \u221260 km s\u22121 , while velocity as negative\nas \u221290 km s\u22121 would indicate a distance closer to the\nNorma arm (see Fig. 4 of McClure-Griffiths et al. 2001).\n6.2. Emission Mechanisms and Geometry\nFig. 5.- Left: Radio pulse history obtained with the analog filterbank during the 4.3 hr Parkes observation at 6.6 GHz beginning\non 2007 August 9 09:57 UT. Note the transitory enhancements on\nthe trailing shoulder of the pulse beginning at 3700 s and at 12,000\ns. A fainter event can also be seen at 800 s. Right: Simultaneous\ncount rate from the XMM-Newton EPIC pn and MOS.\n\n(Camilo et al. 2007b). At the high radio frequency used,\nan uncertainty in DM of 100 cm\u22123 pc contributes a negligible 10 ms uncertainty to the infinite-frequency arrival\ntime.\nThe phase alignment is shown in Figure 4. The centroid of the radio pulse lags the X-ray centroid by 0.15\ncycles, while the peak of the radio pulse comes 0.19 cycles after the X-ray centroid. There were three events\nin the radio observation in which the pulse profile suddenly changed for times ranging from 100 to 800 seconds,\nthen returned to its otherwise steady shape (see Fig. 5).\nThis behavior is peculiar to radio emitting AXPs, and\nis also seen in XTE J1810\u2212197 (Camilo et al. 2007a).\nNo changes in X-rays are seen in connection with these\nevents, as the X-ray flux remained constant throughout\nthe observation.\n6. DISCUSSION\n6.1. Distance\n\nThe X-ray-measured NH \u2248 3 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 exceeds\nthe total Galactic 21 cm H I column density of\n1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 in the direction of 1E 1547.0\u22125408\n(Dickey & Lockman 1990), suggesting that most of the\nabsorption is due to molecular material. The NH equivalent of the CO column density in this direction is\nNH = 2NH2 \u2248 4 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 according to the CO maps\nof Bronfman et al. (1989). Half of the total atomic plus\nmolecular column is then sufficient to account for the\nX-ray absorption.\nThe DM = 830 cm\u22123 pc is consistent with the X-raymeasured NH and implies a distance d \u2248 9 kpc according\nto the free-electron model of Cordes & Lazio (2002). A\nsmaller d \u2248 4 kpc was suggested by Gelfand & Gaensler\n\nThe X-ray spectrum of 1E 1547.0\u22125408 is similar to\nthat of other AXPs, having a thermal component that\neven in a low state is fitted by a blackbody of kTBB =\n0.40 keV, which is hotter by at least a factor of 3 than\nmodeled cooling NSs of its same age (e.g., Yakovlev et al.\n2002). This indicates that localized heating of \u223c 3% of\nthe NS surface area by magnetic field decay is the primary source of luminosity in the faintest observed state of\n1E 1547.0\u22125408, with a smaller contribution to the spectrum from magnetospheric scattering. The remainder of\nthe NS surface is presumably too cool to be detected,\ngiven the large distance and intervening absorption of\nsoft X-rays.\nThe 0.15 cycle offset between the radio and X-ray\npulses recalls the question of whether radio emission from\nmagnetars arises on open or closed field lines, or both. It\nis possible that magnetic field lines on which large currents flow and radio emission is generated are anchored\nin the area of concentrated crustal heating from which\nthe thermal X-ray emission emerges. In this case, the\nphase lag of the radio may by due to the azimuthal twist\nof these closed field lines, with the radio emission coming from higher altitude and different azimuth from the\nX-rays. On the other hand, it is not necessary that the Xray and radio emission are associated with the same field\nlines, especially if radio emission is restricted to the open\nfield line bundle while X-ray heating occurs on closed\nfield lines. The present data leave this question open.\nIf we accept the tentative detection of X-ray pulsations\nin 2006 August, then the pulsed fraction decreased by a\nfactor of 2 while the pulsed flux increased by a factor of\n8 during the outburst. Such a trend has been seen in\nother magnetars, notably 1E 1048.1\u22125037 (Tiengo et al.\n2005; Gavriil et al. 2006) and CXOU J164710.2\u2212455216\n(Muno et al. 2007; Israel et al. 2007). One possible reason for this effect is the growth of the hot region, which\noccupies a significant fraction of the NS surface in outburst, but not in quiescence. Another explanation involves the changing relative contributions of the surface\nblackbody and scattered flux. A small surface hot spot\nmay be highly modulated if eclipsed by the rotation of\nthe NS, which may account for the 100% pulsed fraction\n\n\f6\n\nHALPERN ET AL.\n\nof CXOU J164710.2\u2212455216 in quiescence. In outburst,\nenhanced magnetospheric scattering decreases that modulation. In the case of 1E 1547.0\u22125408, the Comptonized component that we fitted represents a small fraction (26 \u2212 32%) of the X-ray flux in any of its states, so\nscattering probably does not account for a change in its\npulsed fraction. However, the increase in heated area to\n16% of the NS surface may have that effect.\nOn the other hand, if we discount the evidence of enhanced pulsed amplitude in 2006, then the small X-ray\npulsed fraction of \u223c 7% in the high state (by inference\nin the low state as well), and the broad radio pulse, suggest that these emitting regions are both close to the\naxis of rotation, i.e., that PSR J1550\u22125418 is nearly an\naligned rotator. This is in contrast to the other radio\nemitting magnetar, XTE J1810\u2212197. The pulsed fraction of XTE J1810\u2212197 was larger (\u2248 50%) at the peak\nof the outburst than in quiescence (Gotthelf et al. 2004).\nThis, plus the polarization properties of the radio pulse,\nled Camilo et al. (2007a) to favor large inclination angles for XTE J1810\u2212197. The observed characteristics\nof the quiescent state of XTE J1810\u2212197, for which only\nan upper limit of \u2248 24% on its pulsed fraction is known\n(Gotthelf et al. 2004), may also be controlled by its surface thermal emission, since unlike 1E 1547.0\u22125408, the\npre-outburst spectrum of XTE J1810\u2212197 appears to be\na cool blackbody covering the entire surface, with no evidence for a surface hot spot.\n6.3. Energetics of the Outburst\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 resembles the transient AXP\nXTE J1810\u2212197 in that its maximum X-ray observed\nluminosity, \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 1035 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 , is similar\nto the steady luminosity of most other AXPs, while\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 and XTE J1810\u2212197 are usually much\nfainter. Assuming that the high state observed here\nbelongs to a well-defined event, we can extrapolate the\ndecay to estimate the total integrated energy in the\noutburst. Unfortunately, the functional form of the\ndecay is not well established due to the small dynamic\nrange of the available data, and the poorly constrained\nquiescent level. If we adopt the linear decay fitted in\nFigure 1 as the flux to be attributed to the outburst,\nthen the total energy beginning on 2007 June 22 will\nbe \u2248 1 \u00d7 1042 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs. In comparison, the\noutburst of XTE J1810\u2212197 released \u2248 6 \u00d7 1042 ergs\n(Gotthelf & Halpern 2007).\nHowever, it is likely that the outburst of\n1E 1547.0\u22125408 began before our earliest observation of it. A serendipitous detection of the radio pulsar\nin a survey on 2007 April 23 is reported by S. Johnston\n(private communication), from which we infer that the\nX-ray outburst was already in progress at least two\nmonths prior to our first Swift observation. The above\nestimate is then a lower bound on the outburst energy.\nAn upper bound on the total energy can be derived by\nhypothesizing that the outburst began shortly after 2006\nAugust 22, when 1E 1547.0\u22125408 was last observed in a\nlow state. In this case, the initial luminosity was 3 times\nthat seen on 2007 June 22, and the integrated energy is\nE \u2248 1 \u00d7 1043 (d/9 kpc)2 ergs.\nAn additional source of uncertainty in the total energy is the possibly aligned geometry of the pulsar as\ndiscussed above. This could cause us to overestimate\n\nthe luminosity, which was calculated assuming isotropic\nflux, by a factor of a few. Nevertheless, the estimates are\nwithin an order of magnitude of the energy released in\nthe outburst of XTE J1810\u2212197. The latter was interpreted as cooling following a deep crustal heating event\n(Halpern & Gotthelf 2005; G\u00fcver et al. 2007), which is a\npromising hypothesis for 1E 1547.0\u22125408 as well.\nCXOU\nJ164710.2\u2212455216\nin\nWesterlund\n1\n(Israel et al. 2007; Muno et al. 2007) is also a transient AXP. Its quiescent flux was a factor of \u223c 100\nfainter than its outburst. The peak luminosity on the\nfirst day of the outburst was \u2248 1 \u00d7 1035 ergs s\u22121 . The\nflux decay followed a power law of index \u22120.28 \u00b1 0.05,\nand the integrated energy in the outburst was \u2248 5 \u00d7 1041\nergs during the first 130 days (Israel et al. 2007),\nalthough it could end up being much higher as the flux\nremained well above the quiescent level. This behavior\nwas similar to the t\u22120.22 decay of the AXP 1E 2259+586\nfollowing a bursting episode (Woods et al. 2004). The\nflux integral of such a shallow decay is unbounded,\nwhich may imply that continuing energy input from the\nmagnetic field dominates the post-burst decay, rather\nthan the simple afterglow of an impulsive event. In\ncontrast to the slow decay of CXOU J164710.2\u2212455216\nand 1E 2259+586, models of cooling after a deep crustal\nheating event follow approximate power-laws in the\nrange t\u22120.6 \u2212 t\u22121.0 (Lyubarsky et al. 2002), while the\nobserved decay of XTE J1810\u2212197 was well fitted by an\nexponential (Gotthelf & Halpern 2007).\nSince there was no detection of X-ray bursting activity from 1E 1547.0\u22125408 prior to its discovery as a radio pulsar, we do not know if a discrete event was responsible for its current outburst. Accordingly, it is not\nyet clear if the decaying X-ray flux is an afterglow of\na sudden injection of energy, or simply one in a series\nof fluctuations in its continuous heating by magnetic\nfield decay. We do know that earlier X-ray observations of 1E 1547.0\u22125408, by Einstein and ASCA, found\nit at fluxes intermediate between the low and high levels recorded here (Gelfand & Gaensler 2007), suggesting\nthat the recent outburst may not be an isolated event.\nIndeed its X-ray flux appears to have levelled off, and\nmay even be rising again.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\n\nPrompted by its discovery as a transient radio pulsar,\nwe obtained new X-ray observations of PSR J1550\u22125418\nthat reveal it in the highest state yet observed, with\nLX \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 1035 ergs s\u22121 and declining. The peak of\nthe outburst was not observed in X-rays, but it could\nhave been several times higher. As this is the second\nAXP to be detected as a transient radio source, after\nXTE J1810\u2212197, we infer that magnetic field rearrangement accompanying an X-ray outburst may be a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for radio turn-on\nof an AXP.\nWe\nalso\ndetected\nX-ray\npulsations\nfrom\nPSR J1550\u22125418 for the first time, although the\npulsed fraction \u223c 7% is among the smallest observed\nfrom AXPs.\nTogether with the properties of the\nsimultaneously observed radio pulse, this may indicate\na nearly aligned geometry. In both quiescence and\noutburst, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by a small\nblackbody hot spot of kTBB = 0.4 \u2212 0.5 keV, with\n\n\fOUTBURST OF AXP 1E 1547.0\u22125408\na lesser Comptonized component, as is the case for\nmost AXPs. The changing luminosity is due mostly\nto the increase in area of the blackbody, and partly\nto its increase in temperature. This, plus the energy\nand time scale of the decay, suggests an origin of the\nbrightening in a deep crustal heating event rather than\na change in magnetospheric currents. The historical\nX-ray luminosities of 1E 1547.0\u22125408 span only a factor\nof 16, including some intermediate states, which is not\nas extreme a range as experienced by XTE J1810\u2212197\nand CXOU J164710.2\u2212455216 (a factor of \u223c 100). It\nis not yet clear if we have sampled the total range of\nluminosity of 1E 1547.0\u22125408, or what the duty cycle\n\n7\n\nand decay time of its largest outbursts are.\nThis investigation is based on observations obtained\nwith XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.
