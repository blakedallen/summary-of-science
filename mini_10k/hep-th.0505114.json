They concluded that\nthere is no five-dimensional static Kaluza-Klein monopole with cosmological constant. The\nmetric ansatz they employed was tailored to describe a static 'Kaluza-Klein' monopole in\nan AdS2 \u00d7 AdS3 background. In the limit in which the cosmological constant \u03bb tends to\n\nzero, the 'KK-AdS monopole' should reduce to the 'KK monopole' in flat space. Moreover,\n\nif the monopole charge tends to zero then the 'KK-AdS monopole' should reduce smoothly\nto the AdS2 \u00d7 AdS3 background. If we relax the requirement that the monopole solution\n\nbe static it is easy to construct a time-dependent five-dimensional soliton that has all the\ndesired properties. Two such solutions in five dimensions have been obtained in [3].\nIn the present paper we consider other possible extensions of Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions that admit a cosmological constant. The essential ingredient in the original KaluzaKlein monopole construction is a Euclidean section of a Taub-NUT-like space; the 'trick'\nemployed in [1, 2] to obtain the monopole solution is to lift this Euclidean section up to\nfive-dimensions by adding a flat time coordinate and then to dimensionally reduce along the\n'Euclidean time' direction from the Euclidean Taub-NUT section. However, in a presence\nof the cosmological constant it is not possible to use the above technique without introducing an explicit time dependence in the metric. Therefore, in order to obtain cosmological\nfour-dimensional magnetic monopole solutions our strategy is to consider directly in fivedimensions the new cosmological Taub-NUT-like solutions1 , recently obtained in [5, 6] and\nperform a Kaluza-Klein compactification along the fifth dimension. The new feature of these\nsolutions is that the four-dimensional dilaton acquires a potential term as an effect of the\ncosmological constant. However their asymptotics are not very appealing physically since\nthey are not asymptotically flat or (A)dS in the Einstein frame. Their metric description\nsimplifies when considered in the string frame: for our explicit examples the four-dimensional\nmetric in the string frame is very similar to the AdS form in the (r, t) sector, except for a\n1\nIt is also worth mentioning that, in a different context [4], some unexpected results were obtained for\nasymptotically AdS Taub-NUT spacetimes.\n\n2\n\n\fdeficit of solid angle in the angular sector. Another interesting feature of the above constructions is that in five dimensions and in some of the higher dimensional examples the nut\ncharge and the cosmological constant are intimately related by a constraint equation imposed\nby the equations of motion. This constraint makes it impossible to consider situations in\nwhich either the cosmological constant or the nut charge go to zero2 . From this perspective\nthe above monopole solutions are qualitatively distinct from their predecessors.\nIn higher than five dimensions we have more choices: we can consider solutions that\nare Ricci flat with different nut parameters or we can consider Taub-NUT like spaces that\nare constructed as circle fibrations over base spaces that have non-trivial topology. We\nalso perform Kaluza-Klein (KK) reductions of the above solutions down to four dimensions,\nobtaining new magnetic monopole solutions. More specifically, in six and seven dimensions\nwe have considered non-singular Ricci-flat solutions for which one can use the KK trick to\nobtain similar KK magnetic brane solutions for which the background spaces are Ricci flat\nBohm spaces of the form S p \u00d7 S q and generically have conical singularities. We considered\n\ntheir further reduction down to four dimensions on Riemannian spaces of constant curvature\nand specifically considered such reductions on spheres. In contrast with the KK procedure\nto untwist the U(1)-fibration, we have considered in six dimensions another method that is\nknown to untwist the circle fibration, namely Hopf duality in string theory. We extended\nthese duality rules to the case of a timelike Hopf-duality of the truncated six-dimensional\nType II theories and applied them to generate charged string solutions in six-dimensions. By\nperforming sphere reductions we obtained the corresponding four-dimensional solutions. In\ngeneral, the presence of the cosmological constant in the higher dimensional theory induces\na scalar potential for the Kaluza-Klein scalar fields. If the isometry generated by the Killing\nvector\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202z\n\nwhich is associated with the circle direction on which we perform the reduction\n\nhas fixed points, then the dilaton, which describes the radius of that extra-dimension, will\ndiverge at the fixed point sets and the D-dimensional metric will be singular at those points.\nIn certain cases we find that the dilaton field also diverges at infinity. Respectively this\nmeans that, physically, the space-time decompactifies near the KK-brane and at infinity; the\nhigher-dimensional theory should be used when describing such objects in these regions.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. We begin in section 2 by reviewing how the\nflat KK monopole can be obtained from the four dimensional Taub-nut solution. We also\nbriefly discuss the KK monopole obtained by using the Euclidian Taub-bolt soliton. We next\npresent in section 3 the new metric ansatz which is a solution of vacuum Einstein's equations\n2\n\nSee [7] for a way to evade this constraint in some special cases.\n\n3\n\n\fwith cosmological constant in five dimensions and we perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction to\nobtain a new four-dimensional monopole solution. In the following sections we consider\nsimilar monopole solutions in higher dimensions and we also perform Kaluza-Klein sphere\nreductions to four dimensions. In six dimensions we apply spatial and timelike Hopf-dualities\nto generate new solutions. Section 5 concludes with some comments, and in appendices, for\nconvenience, the KK reduction formulae and the T -duality rules which relate the truncated\nsix-dimensional Type II theories are summarized.\n\n2\n\nThe GP S magnetic monopole\n\nWe begin by reviewing the original magnetic monopole solution in 4 dimensions that arises\nas a Kaluza-Klein compactification of a 5 dimensional vacuum metric [1, 2]. The essential\ningredient used in the monopole construction is a 4-dimensional version of the Taub-NUT\nsolution, with Euclidean signature. The monopole solution is constructed as follows.\nStart with the Euclidean form of the Taub-NUT solution [8]:\nds2 = FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + FE\u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 \u2212 n2 )d\u03a92\nwhere\nFE (r) =\n\nr 2 \u2212 2mr + n2\nr 2 \u2212 n2\n\nIn general, the U(1) isometry generated by the Killing vector\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(that corresponds to the\n\n1\n\ncoordinate \u03c7 that parameterizes the fibre S ) can have a zero-dimensional fixed point set\n(referred to as a 'nut' solution) or a two-dimensional fixed point set (correspondingly referred\nto as a 'bolt' solution). The regularity of the Euclidean Taub-nut solution requires that\nthe period of \u03c7 be \u03b2 = 8\u03c0n (to ensure removal of the Dirac-Misner string singularity),\nFE (r = n) = 0 (to ensure that the fixed point of the Killing vector\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nis zero-dimensional)\n\nand also \u03b2FE\u2032 (r = n) = 4\u03c0 in order to avoid the presence of the conical singularities at r = n.\nWith these conditions we obtain m = n, yielding\nFE (r) =\n\nr\u2212n\nr+n\n\nTaking now the product of this Euclidean space-time with the real line, we obtain the\nfollowing 5-dimensional Ricci flat metric:\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + FE\u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 \u2212 n2 )d\u03a92\nwhich solves the 5-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations.\n4\n\n\fIf we perform now a Kaluza-Klein reduction along the coordinate \u03c7 (which is periodic\nwith period 8\u03c0n) we obtain the following 4-dimensional fields (with \u03b1 =\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\u221a\n)\n2 3\n\n[1, 2]\n\n1\n\nds2 = \u2212FE2 dt2 + FE 2 (r)dr 2 + FE2 (r 2 \u2212 n2 )d\u03a92\nA = \u22122n cos \u03b8d\u03c6,\n\ne\n\n\u03c6\n\u221a\n3\n\n\u22121\n\n= FE 2\n\n(2.1)\n\nIt is clear now that the metric is asymptotically flat. The above solution describes a magnetic\nmonopole and its properties have been discussed in detail in [1, 2].\nThere are a few extensions of the above construction that we can consider. The obvious\none to explore is the Taub-bolt solution in four-dimensions instead of the nut solution. In\nthis case the Killing vector\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nhas a two-dimensional fixed point set in the 4-dimensional\n\nEuclidean sector. The regularity of the solution is then ensured by the following conditions\n[9, 10, 11]: F (r = rb ) = 0 and\ngiven by \u03b2 =\n\n8\u03c0n\n,\nk\n\n4\u03c0\nF \u2032 (rb )\n\n=\n\n8\u03c0n\nk\n\nwhere k is an integer while the period of \u03c7 is now\n\ni.e. we identify k points on the circle described by \u03c7.\n2)\n2n\nand m = mp = n(4+k\n.\nk\n4k\n\u2202\nis not zero-dimensional;\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nIt is easy to see that the above conditions are satisfied for rb =\nWe must demand that r \u2265 rb > n, so that the fixed point set of\n\nthis in turn avoids the curvature singularity at r = n and forces k = 1. Then the period of\n\nthe coordinate \u03c7 is 8\u03c0n and for the bolt solution we obtain [9]:\n\u0001\n(r \u2212 2n) r \u2212 12 n\nFE (r) =\nr 2 \u2212 n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nAs in the case of the nut solution, we take the product with the real line and obtain a metric\nin five-dimensions that is a solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations. Performing the\nKaluza-Klein compactification along the \u03c7 direction yields (2.1), where now FE (r) is given\nby (2.2). The five-dimensional metric is regular everywhere for r \u2265 2n. However, the four-\n\ndimensional solution obtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction, while asymptotically flat, is now\nsingular at the location of the bolt r = 2n where the dilaton field diverges as expected.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this solution was recently clarified by Liang and Teo [12]\n(see also [13]). It corresponds to a pair of coincident extremal dilatonic black holes with\nopposite magnetic charges. To see this we can use as a seed in the KK procedure the\nEuclidean rotating version of the bolt solution [14, 15]. We add a timelike flat direction in\norder to lift the solution to five dimensions, after which we reduce down to four dimensions.\nWhen n 6= 0 it has been shown in [12] that the above solution describes a pair of extremal\n\ndilatonic black holes carrying opposite but unbalanced magnetic charges and separated by\na distance 2a, a being the rotation parameter, which in this case serves as a measure of\nthe proper distance between the black holes. In the limit a \u2192 0 we obtain the the solution\n5\n\n\f(2.1) and (2.2) which corresponds then to a pair of coincident monopoles that carry opposite\nunbalanced magnetic charges. The total magnetic charge of the system is n.\nSince the above dihole has unbalanced charges it is not possible to introduce a background\nmagnetic field to stabilize the system [12]. Consequently the solution is unstable and is\nexpected to decay to a pure nut solution (the GPS soliton in this case) with total charge n.\n\n3\n\nTaub-Nut-dS/AdS spacetimes in 5 dimensions\n\nIn four dimensions the usual Taub-NUT construction corresponds to a U(1)-fibration over a\ntwo-dimensional Einstein space used as the base space. Usually taken to be the sphere S 2 , it\ncan also be the torus T 2 or the hyperboloid H 2 . In five dimensions the corresponding base\nspace is three dimensional and consequently the above construction is not straightforward.\nHowever, we can construct the five-dimensional Taub-NUT space as a sphere fibration over\na factor space S 2 of the base space [5, 6]. The spacetimes that we obtain are not trivial\nin the sense that there is now a constraint on the possible values of the nut charge and\nthe cosmological constant. Specifically, we cannot simultaneously set the nut charge and/or\nthe cosmological constant to zero: there is no smooth limit in which one can obtain five\ndimensional Minkowski space in this way.\nThe ansatz that we shall use in the construction of these spaces is the following\nds2 = \u2212F (r)(dt \u2212 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + F \u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 + n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + r 2 dz 2\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe above metric will be a solution of the Einstein field equations with positive cosmological\nconstant \u03bb =\n\n6\nl2\n\nprovided\nF (r) =\n\n4ml2 \u2212 r 4 \u2212 2n2 r 2\nl2 (r 2 + n2 )\n\nwhere the field equations impose the constraint 4n2 = l2 . Notice that for large values of r\nthe function F (r) takes negative values and r becomes effectively a timelike coordinate. We\ncan write the solution directly in Euclidean signature (analytically continuing t \u2192 i\u03c7 and\nn \u2192 in):\n\nds2 = FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + FE\u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 \u2212 n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + r 2 dz 2\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere\n\n4r 4 \u2212 2l2 r 2 + 16ml2\n(3.3)\nl2 (4r 2 \u2212 l2 )\nand we restrict the values of r to be greater than the largest root of FE (if it has any) or\nFE (r) =\n\nthan l/2, in order to preserve the metric signature. Since the analytic continuation of n\n6\n\n\fforces the continuation l \u2192 il for consistency with the initial constraint equation we obtain\nan Einstein metric with negative cosmological constant \u03bb = \u2212 l62 .\n\nIn order to remove the usual Misner string singularity in the metric, we have to assume\n\nthat the coordinate \u03c7 is periodic with some period \u03b2. Notice that for r = n the fixed point\nof the Killing vector\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nis one dimensional (i.e. less than its maximal possible co-dimension)\n\nand we have a Taub-nut solution. However, for r = rb , where rb > n is the largest root of\nFE (r), the fixed point set is three-dimensional (its maximal possible value); we shall refer to\nsuch solutions as Taub-bolt solutions.\nAs before, in order to have a regular nut solution we must ensure the same conditions\non the periodicity of \u03c7 and the relationship \u03b2FE\u2032 (r = n) = 4\u03c0. This leads to m =\n\nl2\n;\n64\n\nit is\n\nprecisely for this value of the parameter m that the above solution becomes the Euclidean\nAdS spacetime in five-dimensions.\nThe bolt solutions likewise have the regularity conditions given in the previous section:\nthe period of \u03c7 is \u03b2 =\nrb =\n\nkn\n2\n\n8\u03c0n\nk\n\n=\n\n4\u03c0\n\u2032 (r ) ,\nFE\nb\n\nwhere k is an integer and r = rb > n. These yield\n\nand\n\nk 2 l2 (k 2 \u2212 8)\n(3.4)\n1024\nSetting k \u2265 3 to ensure that rb > n (thereby also avoiding the curvature singularity at\nm = mb =\n\nr = n), we obtain the following family of bolt solutions, indexed by the integer k:\n2\n\n2\n\nds = FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 l cos \u03b8d\u03c6) +\n\nFE\u22121 (r)dr 2\n\nwhere\nFE (r) =\n\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0015\nl\n(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + r 2 dz 2 (3.5)\n+ r \u2212\n2\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n256r 4 \u2212 128l2 r 2 \u2212 k 2 l4 (k 2 \u2212 8)\n64l2 (4r 2 \u2212 l2 )\n\n(3.6)\n\nHowever, for our purposes we need a five-dimensional solution that has Lorentzian signature. To obtain such a solution we shall analytically continue the coordinate z \u2192 it. We\n\nthen obtain the following five-dimensional space-time:\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0015\nl\n2\n2\n\u22121\n2\n2\n(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) \u2212 r 2 dt2 (3.7)\nds = FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 l cos \u03b8d\u03c6) + FE (r)dr + r \u2212\n2\nwhich is a solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological\nconstant. Only when k \u2265 3 (ensuring that rb =\n\n3l\n4\n\n> 2l ) and m = mb from (3.4) is inserted\n\ninto the metric function (3.3) will the solution (3.7) have no curvature singularities; otherwise\nthere is a curvature singularity at r = 2l .\n\n7\n\n\f3.1\n\nMonopole solutions in 4 dimensions\n\nWe are now ready to generate the magnetic monopole solutions in four dimensions using\nthe same procedure as in the GP S case. Since the Taub-nut/bolt solution (3.1) is nonsingular if we periodically identify the coordinate \u03c7 with period \u03b2, we can perform a KaluzaKlein reduction along this direction. The Kaluza-Klein ansatz that we shall use is given in\n1\n\u221a\n.\n2 3\n\nAppendix A, with \u03b1 =\n\nSince our initial space-time is a solution of the Einstein field equations with non-zero\ncosmological constant, the field content in four dimensions will be given by the metric tensor\ng\u03bc\u03bd , a magnetic one-form potential A and a scalar field \u03c6 with a non-trivial scalar potential\nV (\u03c6). We obtain\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nds = \u2212r FE dt +\n\n\u22121\nFE 2 (r)dr 2\n\nA = \u22122n cos \u03b8d\u03c6,\n\ne\n\n\u03c6\n\u221a\n3\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nl2\n2\nd\u03a92\n+ FE r \u2212\n4\n1\n2\n\n\u22121\n\n= FE 2\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere\n\n4r 4 \u2212 2l2 r 2 + 16ml2\nl2 (4r 2 \u2212 l2 )\nThis solution differs from the Kaluza-Klein GP S solution in terms of both the metric\nFE (r) =\n\ncoefficients and by the fact that the scalar field \u03c6 has a potential of the exponential type\n8 \u2212 \u221a\u03c6\nV (\u03c6) = \u2212 2 e 3\nl\nindicating that our Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction yields a massive scalar field.\nTo study the properties of the above 4-dimensional spaces, let us consider first the Taubnut solution, which we have seen corresponds to the AdS solution in five-dimensions. For\nm=\n\nl2\n64\n\nwe obtain (with n = 2l ):\nFE (r) =\n\n4r 2 \u2212 l2\n4l2\n\nand the five-dimensional metric becomes:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nR2 2\n1\nR2 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds = \u2212(1 + 2 )dt +\n(d\u03c7 \u2212 cos \u03b8d\u03c6) + d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6\n2 dR +\nl\n4 l2\n1 + Rl2\n2\n\nwhere we have defined R = 4r 2 \u2212 l2 and rescaled the coordinates t and \u03c7.\n\nAfter Kaluza-Klein compactification we obtain the following four-dimensional fields:\nR\nR2\nRdR2\nR3 2\n\u0001\n(1 + 2 )dt2 +\nd\u03a9\n+\n2\n2l\nl\n8l\n2l 1 + Rl2\nR\n\u2212 \u221a\u03c6\nA = \u2212l cos \u03b8d\u03c6,\ne 3 =\n2l\n\nds2 = \u2212\n\n8\n\n(3.9)\n\n\fThe four-dimensional metric has a curvature singularity at R = 0, where the scalar field also\ndiverges. Its asymptotic structure is given by\n\u0012 \u00134\nR\u03032 2 4 l 3\n2\ndR\u03032 + R\u03032 d\u03a92\nds = \u2212 2 dt +\nl\n9 R\u0303\nwhere we have rescaled t and defined R\u0303 by R\u03032 =\n\nR3\n8l\n\nand we can see that it is not asymp-\n\ntotically flat. However, one can check by computing some of the curvature scalars (like\nRabcd Rabcd ) that the above asymptotic metric is well-behaved at infinity and that it has a\ncurvature singularity at R\u0303 = 0. Notice however that at both R = 0 and R \u2192 \u221e the dilaton\n\nis blowing up and the extra dimension opens up, which means that the physical description\nis effectively five-dimensional.\nFor the bolt solution we must take k \u2265 3 and m = mp , for which\nFE (r) =\n\n256r 4 \u2212 128l2 r 2 \u2212 k 2 l4 (k 2 \u2212 8)\n64l2 (4r 2 \u2212 l2 )\n\nThe compactified four-dimensional solution is given again by (3.8) and its asymptotic structure is the same as the one obtained from the five-dimensional AdS spacetime. Again the\nfour-dimensional metric will have a curvature singularity at the bolt while the dilaton diverges at r = rb and at infinity.\nNext, let us notice that in the string frame the situation changes as follows. The fivedimensional nut solution reduces to the following metric:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\nR2\nR2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03b8 + sin \u03b8d\u03c6\nds = \u2212(1 + 2 )dt +\n2 dR +\nl\n4\n1 + Rl2\nWhile this metric resembles a four-dimensional AdS metric with cosmological constant \u03bb =\n\u2212 l32 in fact there is a deficit of solid angle as the area of the 2-sphere is \u03c0R2 instead of 4\u03c0R2 .\nThis behavior is characteristic of a global monopole [16]. The above metric has a curvature\n\nsingularity at the origin (the location of the monopole) and the dilaton field diverges both\nat origin and at infinity. The magnetic charge is computed using the formula [17]:\nZ\n1\nF =l\n4\u03c0 S 2\nNote that if we reduce directly the five-dimensional metric (3.1), which is time-dependent\n(outside the cosmological horizon the coordinate r is timelike) we obtain a time-dependent\nfour-dimensional magnetic monopole solution.\nOne characteristic feature of the above constructions is that the nut charge and the cosmological constant are intimately related by a constraint equation imposed by the equations\n9\n\n\fof motion. This constraint makes it impossible for us to consider the cases in which either\nthe cosmological constant or the nut charge go to zero. From this perspective the above\nmonopole solutions are qualitatively distinct from their predecessors.\n\n4\n\nHigher dimensional magnetic monopoles\n\nWe now consider some of the higher dimensional Taub-NUT spaces constructed recently\n[5, 6]. In the Taub-NUT ansatz the idea is to construct such spaces as radial extensions of\nU(1)-fibrations over an even dimensional base endowed with an Einstein-K\u00e4hler metric. In\na (2k + 2)-dimensional Taub-NUT space the base factor over which one constructs the circle\nfibration can have at most dimension 2k. However, it is not necessary to construct the circle\nfibration over the whole base space; in general one can consider factorizations of the base of\nthe form B = M \u00d7 Y in which M is endowed with an Einstein-K\u00e4hler metric while Y is an\nEinstein space with the metric gY . In these cases one can consider the U(1)-fibration only\n\nover the factor space M of the base and take then a warped product with the manifold Y .\nThe ansatz is then given by\nF \u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 + N 2 )gM + r 2 gY \u2212 F (r)(dt + A)2\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe now consider particular cases of this ansatz.\n\n4.1\n\nSix dimensional metrics\n\nIn six dimensions the base space is four-dimensional and we can use products of the form\nM1 \u00d7 M2 of two-dimensional Einstein spaces or we can use CP 2 as a four-dimensional base\nspace over which to construct the circle fibrations. If we use products of two dimensional\n\nEinstein spaces then we can consider all the cases in which Mi , i = 1, 2 can be a sphere S 2 ,\na torus T 2 or a hyperboloid H 2 . The circle fibration can be constructed in these cases over\nthe whole base space M1 \u00d7 M2 or just over one factor space Mi .\n\nWe shall consider first the case in which M1 = M2 = S 2 and assume that the U(1)\n\nfibration is constructed over the whole base space S 2 \u00d7 S 2 . Then the corresponding six-\n\ndimensional Taub-NUT solution is given by [5]\n\nds2 = \u2212F (r)(dt \u2212 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )2 + F \u22121 (r)dr 2\n\n+(r 2 + n21 )(d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + (r 2 + n22 )(d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 )\n\n10\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fwhere\nF (r) =\n\n3r 6 + (l2 + 5n22 + 10n21 )r 4 + 3(n22 l2 + 10n21 n22 + n21 l2 + 5n41 )r 2\n3(r 2 + n21 )(r 2 + n22 )l2\n6ml2 r \u2212 3n21 n22 (l2 + 5n21 )\n+\n3(r 2 + n21 )(r 2 + n22 )l2\n\n(4.3)\n\nHere the above metric is a solution of vacuum Einstein field equations with cosmological\n) if and only if (n21 \u2212 n22 )\u03bb = 0. Consequently we see that differing values\nconstant (\u03bb = \u2212 10\nl2\nfor n1 and n2 are possible only if the cosmological constant vanishes. For n1 = n2 = n the\n\nabove solution reduces to the six-dimensional solution found in [18, 19]. In what follows we\nshall look at the case of two different nut charges, that is we set the cosmological constant\nto zero.\nLet us consider the Euclidean section, obtained by the following analytic continuations\nt \u2192 i\u03c7 and nj \u2192 inj where j = 1, 2:\nds2 = FE (r)(d\u03c7 \u2212 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 )2 + FE\u22121 (r)dr 2\n\n+(r 2 \u2212 n21 )(d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + (r 2 \u2212 n22 )(d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 )\n\nwhere\nFE (r) =\n\n(4.4)\n\nr 4 \u2212 3(n21 + n22 )r 2 + 6mr \u2212 3n21 n22\n3(r 2 \u2212 n21 )(r 2 \u2212 n22 )\n\n(4.5)\n\nThis metric is a solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations without cosmological\nconstant, for any values of the parameters n1 and n2 . In order to analyze the possible\nsingularities we have to consider two cases, depending on the values of the nut charges n1\nand n2 . Let us assume first that n1 = n2 = n. Then the Taub-nut solutions correspond to\nthe fixed-point sets of\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nat r = n. The mass parameter m =\n\n4n3\n,\n3\n\nwhile the periodicity of\n\nthe coordinate \u03c7 is 12\u03c0n. For the bolt solution we impose the periodicity of the coordinate\n\u03c7 to be\n\n12\u03c0n\n.\nk\n\nThe fixed-point set is four-dimensional and located at r = rp =\n\nthe mass parameter given by m = mp =\n\nn3 (k 4 +18k 2 \u221227)\n.\n6k 3\n\n3n\nk\n\n> n , with\n\nHence we must consider only the\n\nvalues k = 1, 2, which in turn avoids the curvature singularity at r = n.\nIf the two nut charges n1 and n2 differ, we set n1 > n2 without loss of generality. In this\ncase in the Euclidean section the radius r cannot be smaller than n1 or the signature of the\nspacetime will change. The Taub-nut solution in this case corresponds to a two-dimensional\nfixed-point set located at r = n1 . There is still a curvature singularity located at r = n1 ,\nremoved by setting the periodicity of the coordinate \u03c7 to be 8\u03c0n1 , while the value of the\nmass parameter must be m = mp =\n\nn31 +3n1 n22\n.\n3\n\n11\n\n\fThe bolt solution corresponds to a four-dimensional fixed-point set located at r = rb =\n2n1\n,\nk\n\nfor which the periodicity of the coordinate \u03c7 is given by\n\nparameter is m = mp =\n\nn1 (12n22 \u22124n21 )\n12\n\n8\u03c0n1\nk\n\nand the value of the mass\n\n. In order to avoid the curvature singularity at r = n1\n\nwe must choose k = 1 so that r > rb = 2n1 .\nIn the following we consider the Taub-nut solution for which n1 > n2 . The periodicity\nof the coordinate \u03c7 is taken to be 8\u03c0n1 while the value of the mass parameter is fixed to be\nm = mp =\n\nn31 +3n1 n22\n.\n3\n\nFor these values the six-dimensional metric is nonsingular at r = n1 .\n\nEmploying the usual Kaluza-Klein procedure we obtain a six-dimensional magnetic monopole:\nwe add a flat time direction to obtain a seven-dimensional solution of the vacuum Einstein\nfield equations and after that perform a Kaluza-Klein compactification along the coordinate\n\u03c7 using the metric ansatz:\nds27 = e\n\n\u221a\u03c6\n10\n\n\u2212 \u221a4\u03c6\n\nds26 + e\n\n10\n\n(d\u03c7 \u2212 A(1) )2\n\nIt is easy to check that we obtain the following six-dimensional fields\n1 \u0002\n1\n\u0003\n\u22123\nds26 = \u2212FE4 dt2 + FE 4 dr 2 + FE4 (r 2 \u2212 n21 )(d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + (r 2 \u2212 n22 )(d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 )\n\nA(1) = \u22122n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 ,\n\n\u2212 \u221a\u03c6\n\ne\n\n10\n\n1\n\n(4.6)\n\n= FE4\n\nwhere we now restrict r \u2265 n1 > n2 and\nFE (r) =\n\nr 3 + n1 r 2 \u2212 (2n21 + 3n22 )r + 3n1 n22\n3(r + n1 )(r 2 \u2212 n22 )\n\nOne can check that the above six-dimensional monopole solution has a curvature singularity located at r = n1 . It is interesting to note that the asymptotic structure of this\nsolution, after rescaling the coordinates t \u2192 31/4 T and r \u2192 3\u22123/8 R is given by\n\n1\n1\nds2asymp = \u2212dT 2 + dR2 + R2 (d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + R2 (d\u03b822 + sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 )\n3\n3\n\nThe area of each 2-sphere is not 4\u03c0R2 but instead\n\n4\u03c0R2\n:\n3\n\neach has a deficit solid angle of\n\n8\u03c0\n3\n\nsteradians. Furthermore, the above asymptotic form of the metric is Ricci flat, and can be\nobtained from our solution by setting n = 0. Therefore we conclude that the background\nfor our monopole is a Ricci flat Bohm metric constructed as a cone over S 2 \u00d7 S 2 [20, 21].\n\nThe corresponding six-dimensional Lagrangian obtained after Kaluza-Klein reduction is\n\ngiven by\n\nwhere F(2) = dA(1)\n\n1\n1 \u2212 \u221a5 \u03c6 2\nL6 = eR \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 ee 10 F(2)\n2\n4\n= 2n1 \u03a91 +2n2 \u03a92 and we have denoted by \u03a9i the volume form sin \u03b8i d\u03b8i \u2227d\u03c6i\n\nof the sphere Mi , i = 1, 2.\n\n12\n\n\fIn the following we shall perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction on M2 .

Moreover the metric has infinite redshift at the origin3 , which is\nalso the location of a curvature singularity. It takes an infinite time for a photon to reach\ninfinity and, indeed, the (r, t)-sector is asymptotically flat; however, while the metric it is\nsingularity-free at infinity the scalar field \u03c6 diverges there.

The\n\nmagnetic charge is computed to be 2n1 .\nThe second case to discuss in six dimensions is a generalization of the five-dimensional\nsolution presented in the previous section. The metric ansatz is as follows:\nds2 = \u2212F (r)(dt \u2212 2n cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 )2 + F \u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 + n2 )(d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + \u03b1r 2(d\u03b822 + d\u03c622 )\n\u22123r 5 + (l2 \u2212 10n2 )r 3 + 3n2 (l2 \u2212 5n2 )r + 6ml2\n(4.9)\nF (r) =\n3rl2 (r 2 + n2 )\nand the vacuum Einstein field equations with cosmological constant are satisfied if and only\nif \u03b1(2 \u2212 \u03bbn2 ) = 0. Since \u03b1 cannot be zero we must restrict the values of n and \u03bb =\n3\n\n10\nl2\n\nsuch\n\nA similar BPS monopole solution with an infinite redshift at the origin but with a deficit of solid angle\nhas been obtained in [23].\n\n13\n\n\fthat \u03bbn2 = 2, forcing a positive cosmological constant. The Euclidean section is obtained\n\u221a\nby taking the analytic continuation t \u2192 i\u03c7 and n \u2192 in and l \u2192 il with l = 5n. Notice\n\nthat in this case the Taub-nut solution corresponds to a two-dimensional fixed-point set of\nthe vector field\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nlocated at r = n. The periodicity of the \u03c7 coordinate is in this case\n\nequal to 8\u03c0n and the value of the mass parameter is fixed to mb =\n\nn3\n.\n15\n\nFor this value of\n\nthe mass parameter the solution is regular at the nut location. The bolt spacetime has a\nfour-dimensional fixed-point set of\nis mb =\n\nk 3 n3 (20\u22123k 2 )\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c7\n\nlocated at rb =\n\nkn\n2\n\nand the value of the mass parameter\n\nwhere the periodicity of the coordinate \u03c7 is\n\n960\n\n8\u03c0n\n,\nk\n\nwhere k is an integer.\n\nTo ensure that rb > n we have to take k > 3 ; in this way the curvature singularity at r = n\nis avoided as well. We next perform another analytic continuation of one of the coordinates\non T 2 (say \u03b82 \u2192 it) and then two Kaluza-Klein reductions along the \u03c7 and \u03c62 directions\n\ndown to four dimensions.

However, notice that while \u03c62 diverges at the root of FE , \u03c61 is finite there. The\nmagnetic charge is found to be 2n.\n4.1.1\n\nHopf reductions in six dimensions\n\nIt is well-known that odd-dimensional spheres S 2n+1 may be regarded as circle bundles\nover CP n and one can use the so-called Hopf duality (a T-duality along the U(1)-fibre) to\ngenerate new solutions [24, 25, 26] by untwisting S 2n+1 to CP n \u00d7 S 1 . The six-dimensional\n14\n\n\fcase is particularly interesting for us since it has been shown in [25] that it is possible to make\nconsistent truncations of the maximal Type II supergravity theories to a bosonic sector which\nexhibits an O(2, 2) global symmetry with the T -duality transformation taking a simple form.\nThe theories at hand are the toroidal reductions of Type IIA, respectively Type IIB tendimensional supergravities while the reduction ansatz for the fields is that the six-dimensional\nfields that are retained are precisely the ten-dimensional ones, with the spacetime indices\nrestricted to run over the six-dimensional range only. The two truncated theories in D = 6\nare then related by a T-duality transformation upon reduction to D = 5. The explicit\nmappings of the fields have been given in [25] and we follow their notational conventions.\nFor convenience we also provide the derivation of the T -duality rules in Appendix B.\nLet us start with the solution given in (4.3) in which we set \u03bb = 0. We shall perform\nfirst the analytic continuations [27] t \u2192 iz, n1 \u2192 in1 and subsequently \u03c62 \u2192 it:\nds2 = F\u0303 (r)(dz \u2212 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 dt)2 + F\u0303 \u22121 (r)dr 2\n\n+(r 2 \u2212 n21 )(d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 ) + (r 2 + n22 )(d\u03b822 \u2212 sin2 \u03b82 dt2 )\n\nwhere\nF\u0303 (r) =\n\n(4.11)\n\nr 4 \u2212 3(n21 \u2212 n22 )r 2 + 6mr + 3n21 n22\n3(r 2 \u2212 n21 )(r 2 + n22 )\n\nConsidering the above metric as a solution of the pure gravity sector of the truncated Type\nIIA theory we can now perform a Hopf-duality along the spacelike z-direction to obtain a\nsolution of six-dimensional Type IIB theory:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nds6B = F\u0303 (r)\u2212 2 dz 2 + F\u0303 (r)\u2212 2 dr 2 + F\u0303 (r) 2 (r 2 \u2212 n21 )d\u03a921 + F\u0303 (r) 2 (r 2 + n22 )(d\u03b822 \u2212 sin2 \u03b82 dt2 )\ne2\u03c61 = e2\u03c62 = F\u0303 (r),\n\nS\nAN\n(2) = \u22122n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c62 \u2227 dz + 2n2 cos \u03b82 dt \u2227 dz\n\n(4.12)\n\nWe can also make the analytic continuations t \u2192 i\u03c62 and n1 \u2192 in1 to obtain the solution:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nds6B = \u2212F (r)\u2212 2 dt2 + F (r)\u2212 2 dr 2 + F (r) 2 (r 2 + n21 )d\u03a921 + F (r) 2 (r 2 + n22 )d\u03a922\ne2\u03c61 = e2\u03c62 = F (r),\n\nS\nAN\n(2) = 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c62 \u2227 dt \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2227 dt\n\n(4.13)\n\nWere we to consider (4.11) as a solution of the pure gravity sector of Type IIB theory,\nthen after performing the spacelike Hopf dualisation we would obtain as an intermediate\nstep\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nds6A = F\u0303 (r)\u2212 2 dz 2 + F\u0303 (r)\u2212 2 dr 2 + F\u0304 (r) 2 (r 2 \u2212 n21 )d\u03a921 + F\u0304 (r) 2 (r 2 + n22 )(d\u03b822 \u2212 sin2 \u03b82 dt2 )\ne2\u03c61 = e2\u03c62 = F\u0304 (r),\n\nA(2) = \u22122n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c62 \u2227 dz + 2n2 cos \u03b82 dt \u2227 dz\n15\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fPerforming the analytic continuations we recover (4.13) except that we have now to replace\nS\nAN\n(2) with A(2) .\n\nIt is interesting to note that we can perform directly a timelike Hopf reduction in sixdimensions4 . In this case if we start with a solution of Type IIA theory by performing the\ntimelike T-duality we obtain a solution of the appropriate truncation of Type IIB\u2217 theory\n[28]. If we start instead with a solution of Type IIB theory and perform a timelike Hopf\nduality we end up with a solution of an appropriate truncation of Type IIA\u2217 theory. The\ndetails of these reductions are gathered in the Appendix B.\nAs an example we shall perform a Hopf duality starting from Type IIA theory. Consider\n(4.3) as a solution of the pure gravity sector of the truncated six-dimensional Type IIA\ntheory. Then the final solution of Type IIB\u2217 will be given by:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nds6B\u2217 = \u2212F (r)\u2212 2 dt2 + F (r)\u2212 2 dr 2 + F (r) 2 (r 2 + n21 )d\u03a921 + F (r) 2 (r 2 + n22 )d\u03a922\ne2\u03c61 = e2\u03c62 = F (r),\n\nS\nAN\n(2) = 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 dt \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2227 dt\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere now\n\nr 4 \u2212 3(n21 + n22 )r 2 + 6mr \u2212 3n21 n22\n3(r 2 + n21 )(r 2 + n22 )\nIf we start with (4.3) as a solution of Type IIB then peforming a timelike Hopf dualisation\nF (r) =\n\nwe obtain a similar solution of Type IIA\u2217 for which:\nA(2) = 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c61 \u2227 dt \u2212 2n2 cos \u03b82 d\u03c62 \u2227 dt\n\n(4.16)\n\nAs we can see, some of the solutions obtained for Type IIA (respectively IIB) and Type\nIIA (respectively IIB\u2217 ) are identical after we perform appropriate analytic continuations5 .\n\u2217\n\nThis is to be expected once we notice that they are solutions of the NSNS-sector only,\nwhich is the same for both theories (their actions would differ only by the sign of the kinetic\nterms of the RR-fields).\nAs an application of these solutions let us set for convenience n2 = 0 in (4.13) and perform\na sphere reduction using the ansatz (4.1) down to a four-dimensional solution:\nds4B = \u2212r 2 dt2 + r 2 dr 2 + F (r)r 2(r 2 + n21 )d\u03a921\ne\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c6\n\n= r 4 F (r),\n\ne2\u03c61 = e2\u03c62 = F (r),\n\nS\nAN\n(2) = 2n1 cos \u03b81 d\u03c62 \u2227 dt\n\nwhich is a solution of the equations of motion derived from the following Lagrangian:\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 \u221a\u03c6 \u2212\u03c6 \u2212\u03c6\nNS 2\nL4B = eR \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c61 )2 \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c62 )2 \u2212 ee 2 1 2 (F(3)\n) + ee 2\u03c6 R2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n5\n\nIn which case we do not need to perform any analytical continuations.\nWhich keep the metric and the fields real.\n\n16\n\n(4.17)\n\n\fThe asymptotic form of the metric (4.17) is (after defining R =\n\nr2\n2\n\nand rescaling t)\n\n4\nds4B \u223c \u2212Rdt2 + dR2 + R2 d\u03a921\n3\nAmusingly, the asymptotic form of the metric is the same with (4.8). The magnetic charge is\nfound to be 2n and notice that there is an excess of solid angle as the area of the asymptotic\nsphere is\n\n4.2\n\n16\u03c0R2\n3\n\ninstead of the expected 4\u03c0R2 .\n\nMonopoles in D \u2265 7 dimensions\n\nSimilarly, we can construct Kaluza-Klein monopoles in seven and higher dimensions. For\nexample, in seven dimensions the base space is five-dimensional and can be factorized in the\nform B = M \u00d7 Y , where M is an even dimensional space endowed with an Einstein-K\u00e4hler\n\nmetric and Y is a Riemannian Einstein space.\n\nLet us consider the case in which M = S 2 while Y can be a sphere S 3 , a torus T 3 or a\nhyperboloid H 3 . The solution is [5]\nds2 = \u2212F (r)(dt2 + 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + F \u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 + n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + \u03b2r 2 gY\nwhere gY is the metric on the unit-sphere S 3 , torus T 3 or hyperboloid H 3 :\nF (r) =\n\n4r 6 + (l2 + 12n2 )r 4 + 2n2 (l2 + 6n2 )r 2 + 4ml2 + n4 (l2 + 6n2 )\n4l2 r 2 (r 2 + n2 )\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe cosmological constant is \u03bb = \u2212 15\nand the parameters \u03b2, n and \u03bb are constrained via\nl2\n\nthe relation \u03b2(5 \u2212 2\u03bbn2 ) = 10k, where k = 1, 0, \u22121 for S 3 , T 3 and H 3 respectively. We must\n\nhave \u03b2 > 0, which in turn imposes a joint constraint on \u03bbn2 that can be satisfied in various\n\nways depending on the value of k. Since we are interested in a Ricci flat solution we shall\nconsider \u03bb = 0 and also k = 1, in which case Y = S 3 and \u03b2 = 2. The Euclidean section of\nthis solution, which is obtained by analytic continuation of the coordinate t \u2192 i\u03c7 and of the\nparameter n \u2192 in is given by:\n\nds2 = FE (r)(d\u03c72 + 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 + FE\u22121 (r)dr 2 + (r 2 \u2212 n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + 2r 2 gY\nwhere\nF (r) =\n\nr 4 \u2212 2n2 r 2 + n4 + 4m\n4r 2 (r 2 \u2212 n2 )\n\n(4.19)\n\nThe metric has a scalar curvature singularity located at r = n as can be checked by computing\nfor instance the Kretschman scalar. However, if we take m = 0 then the metric is wellbehaved at r = n. Furthermore, if r < n the signature of the metric is unphysical; therefore\n17\n\n\fwe can restrict ourselves to the interval r \u2265 n for which the solution is non-singular. In order\n\nto obtain the magnetic brane in seven-dimensions we employ the usual procedure: add a flat\ntimelike direction and compactify the Ricci-flat eight-dimensional metric using the ansatz\nds28 = e\n\n\u221a\u03c6\n15\n\n\u2212 \u221a5\u03c6\n\nds27 + e\n\n15\n\n(d\u03c7 \u2212 A(1) )2\n\nWe obtain the following seven-dimensional fields:\n1\n\n1\n\n\u22124\n\nds27 = \u2212FE5 dt2 + FE 5 dr 2 + FE5 (r 2 \u2212 n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + 2r 2 d\u03a923\n1\n\n\u2212 \u221a\u03c6\n\nA(1) = \u22122n cos \u03b8d\u03c6,\n\ne\n\nwhere now r \u2265 n and\n\n= FE5\n\n15\n\n\u0001\n\n(4.20)\n\nr 2 \u2212 n2\n4r 2\nwhich are a solution of the equations of motion derived from the following Lagrangian:\nFE (r) =\n\n1 \u2212 \u221a6 \u03c6 2\n1\nL7 = eR \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 ee 15 F(2)\n2\n4\nThe above seven-dimensional metric has a curvature singularity at r = n. Its asymptotic\nstructure, after we rescale the coordinates t \u2192 41/10 T and r \u2192 4\u22122/5 R, is given by\nds2asymp = \u2212dT 2 + dR2 +\n\nR2\n(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + 23/5 R2 d\u03a923\n4\n\nThis space has a deficit of solid angle corresponding to the sphere S 2 while the factor S 3 has\na surfeit of solid angle.\nLet us perform now a further dimensional reduction of the above seven-dimensional\nsolution on the three-sphere S 3 .

Consequently the spacetime that we\n\nobtain is conformally flat and singularity free at infinity. The magnetic charge is found to\nbe 2n.\nGeneralization to more than seven dimensions is straightforward. For instance, in eight\ndimensions we can consider a circle fibration over the product S 2 \u00d7 S 2 \u00d7 S 2 and associate\n\nfor each sphere factor a nut charge ni , i = 1..3.

Our\nmetric contain three different nut parameters. Taking its Euclidean section (obtained by\nanalytically continuing t \u2192 i\u03c7, nj \u2192 inj for j = 1..3) and adding a trivial time direction we\n\ncan then perform Kaluza-Klein reductions along the \u03c7 direction and also along two of the\nspheres to obtain a final four-dimensional monopole solution.\nWe can also consider different factorizations of the base space in terms of products of\n\nEinstein-K\u00e4hler manifolds with various lower dimensional Einstein spaces (as in [5]).\nAnother interesting solution can be found in eleven dimensions by using the ansatz:\nds2 = \u2212F (r)(dt + 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6)2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ (r 2 + n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) + 6r 2d\u03a927\nF (r)\n\nand by solving the vacuum Einstein field equations we find:\nF (r) =\n\n3r 8 + 4n2 r 6 + 24m\n24r 6(r 2 + n2 )\n\nHere d\u03a927 is the metric on the 7-sphere, normalized such that its Ricci tensor is Rij = 6gij .\nThe Euclidean section is obtained by analytic continuations t \u2192 i\u03c7 and n \u2192 in. We can also\n19\n\n\freplace the sphere element by any other Einstein space of positive curvature. For example,\nif we embed the seven dimensional de Sitter solution we obtain the metric:\ndr 2\n+ (r 2 \u2212 n2 )(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\nds = F\u0303 (r)(d\u03c7 + 2n cos \u03b8d\u03c6) +\nF\u0303 (r)\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n2\ndR2\nR\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndt +\n+r \u2212 1 \u2212\n2 + R d\u03a95\n6\n1 \u2212 R6\n3r 8 \u2212 4n2 r 6 + 24m\nF\u0303 (r) =\n24r 6 (r 2 \u2212 n2 )\n2\n\n2\n\n(4.23)\n\nIt can be easily checked there is a curvature singularity located at r = 0. Misner string\nsingularities can be removed by requiring the \u03c7 coordinate to have period 8\u03c0n and m =\n\nn8\n.\n24\n\nThe values of the coordinate r are then restricted to r > n avoiding the curvature singularity\nat r = 0. This solution corresponds to a seven dimensional fixed-point set of the isometry\n\u2202\u03c7 ; since this is not the maximal possible co-dimension, it is a Taub-nut solution.\nThe other possibility is that of a nine-dimensional fixed-point set of the isometry \u2202\u03c7 ,\nlocated at rb = 2n. The periodicity of the \u03c7 coordinate is still 8\u03c0n but now the values of\nthe r coordinate are such that r \u2265 rb = 2n. This in turn avoids the curvature singularities\n8\n\nlocated at r = 0 and r = n, provided the value of the mass parameter is m = \u2212 64n\n.\n3\n\nLet us perform now a Kaluza-Klein compactification along the coordinate \u03c7.

We can dualize F(2) to a 3-form field\n\nstrength and we find that the above solution would describe a non-uniform electric string in\nfive dimensions as our solution depends explicitly on the fifth dimension R. This solution is\nvery likely to be unstable as in eleven dimensions the 'de Sitter horizon' is delocalised along\nthe noncompact direction r.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have constructed higher dimensional Kaluza-Klein brane solutions with and\nwithout cosmological constant, generalizing the original KK-monopole solution [1, 2]. The\nsimplest generalization in four dimensions uses the Taub-bolt solution as a seed and the\nphysical interpretation of the final KK-bolt monopole solution was recently clarified in the\nliterature [12, 13]: it corresponds to a pair of coincident extremal dilatonic black holes with\nopposite unequal magnetic charges.\nIn five dimensions we considered cosmological Taub-NUT-like metrics [5, 6] and performed similar KK reductions down to four dimensions. The new feature of these solutions\nis that the four-dimensional dilaton acquires a potential term in the Lagrangian as an effect\nof the cosmological constant. However their asymptotics are not very appealing physically\nsince they are not asymptotically flat or asymptotically (A)dS. Their metric description simplifies when considered in the string frame. For our explicit examples the four-dimensional\nmetric in the string frame is very similar to the AdS form in the (r, t) sector, except for a\ndeficit of solid angle in the angular sector, which is characteristic for global monopoles. Another feature of the above constructions is that in five dimensions and in some of the higher\ndimensional examples the nut charge and the cosmological constant are intimately related\nby a constraint equation imposed by the equations of motion. This constraint makes it impossible to consider situations in which either the cosmological constant or the nut charge go\nto zero. From this perspective the above monopole solutions are qualitatively distinct from\ntheir predecessors.\nOn the other hand, in six and seven dimensions we have considered non-singular Ricciflat solutions for which one can use the KK trick to obtain similar KK magnetic brane\nsolutions for which the background spaces are Ricci flat Bohm spaces of the form S p \u00d7 S q\n21\n\n\fand generically have conical singularities. We considered their further reduction down to\nfour dimensions on Riemannian spaces of constant curvature and specifically considered\nsuch reductions on spheres. In higher dimensions, we showed that we can also consider\nmonopole solutions in cosmological backgrounds. All the above solutions from section 4 have\na corresponding extension for which the cosmological constant is non-zero and are similarly\nexpected to produce magnetic KK brane solutions upon dimensional reduction. In contrast\nwith the KK procedure to untwist the U(1)-fibration, we have considered in six dimensions\nanother method, which is known to untwist the circle fibration, namely Hopf duality in\nstring theory. We extended the Hopf duality rules to the case of a timelike Hopf-duality of\nthe truncated six-dimensional Type II theories and applied them to generate charged string\nsolutions in six-dimensions. By performing sphere reductions we obtained the corresponding\nfour-dimensional solutions with magnetic charges.\nAs avenues for further research it would be interesting to use the recently discovered\nnut-charged rotating solutions in higher dimensions [31]. It is known that starting from\nthe four dimensional NUT-charged Kerr solution, the KK procedure leads to a solution\ndescribing a brane/anti-brane pair carrying opposite unbalanced magnetic charges [12]. The\ncase of higher dimensional Kerr solution has been explored in [32] where it was found that\nfor instance in six dimensions one obtains a string loop instead of a pair of monopoles and\nanti-monopoles. It would be interesting to see the effect of the nut charge in these cases.\nWork on this is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Natural Sciences & Engineering Research Council of\nCanada.\n\nA: Kaluza-Klein Reduction\nThe usual metric ansatz for the dimensional reduction from (D + 1) dimensions to D dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theory is given by:\nd\u015d2 = e2\u03b1\u03c6 ds2 + e\u22122(D\u22122)\u03b1\u03c6 (dz + A)2\nwith \u03b1 =\n\nq\n\n1\n.\n2(D\u22121)(D\u22122)\n\n(A-1)\n\nHere the D-dimensional metric ds2 corresponds to the so-called\n\nEinstein frame, while its conformal rescaling e2\u03b1\u03c6 ds2 is the metric in the string frame.\nThen a general bosonic Lagrangian in (D + 1) dimensions of the form:\n1 \u00e2\u03c6\u0302 2\n1\n\u00eae F\u0302n\nL = \u00eaR\u0302 + 2\u00ea\u03bb \u2212 \u00ea(\u2202 \u03c6\u0302)2 \u2212\n2\n2n!\n22\n\n\fwill reduce in D dimensions to the Lagrangian given by the formula [29]:\n\nHere e =\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n1\n1\nL = eR \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c6)2 \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c6)2 + 2e\u03bbe2\u03b1\u03c6 \u2212 e * e\u22122(D\u22121)\u03b1\u03c6 F 2\n2\n2\n4\n1\n1\n\u22122(n\u22121)\u03b1\u03c6+\u00e2\u03c6 \u2032 2\n2\n\u2212\ne*e\nF n\u2212\ne * e2(D\u2212n)\u03b1\u03c6+\u00e2\u03c6 Fn\u22121\n2n!\n2(n \u2212 1)!\n\n(A-2)\n\n\u2212g, F = dA and A = A\u03bc dx\u03bc is the one-form potential that appears in the\n\nKaluza-Klein form of the metric, while the ansatz used for the KK-reduction of the matter\nfields from (D + 1)-dimensions is \u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6 for the scalar field, and \u00c2n\u22121 = An\u22121 + An\u22122 \u2227 dz\nfor the anti-symmetric potential \u00c2n\u22121 .

Also, if the isometry generated by the Killing vector\n\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n\nhas fixed points, then the dilaton \u03c6 will diverge and the\n\nD-dimensional metric will be singular at those points.\n\nB: T-duality in six dimensions\nThe Lagrangian in D = 6 obtained by dimensional reduction of Type IIB on a torus and\nafter performing a consistent truncation is given by [25]:\n1\n1\n1\n1\nL6B = eR \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c61 )2 \u2212 e(\u2202\u03c62 )2 \u2212 ee2\u03c61 (\u2202\u03c71 )2 \u2212 ee2\u03c62 (\u2202\u03c72 )2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1 \u2212\u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 N S 2\n1 \u03c61 \u2212\u03c62 RR 2\nS\nRR\n\u2212 ee\n(F(3) ) \u2212 ee\n(F(3) ) + \u03c72 dAN\n(2) \u2227 dA(2)\n12\n12\n\n(B-1)\n\nNS\nRR\nRR\nNS\nS\nwhere F(3)\n= dAN\n(2) and F(3) = dA(2) + \u03c71 dA(2) .

As it is known this duality\nwill relate Type IIA (respectively IIB) to Type IIB\u2217 (respectively IIA\u2217 ). We wish to see if\nat the level of our truncated theories the timelike T-duality rules are still valid.\nConsider first the Type IIA theory. Upon a timelike dimensional reduction the Lagrangian of the reduced theory will have a form similar with (B-4); however the kinetic\nterms for F(3)1 , F(2)1 , F(2) and dA(0)1 will have the reversed sign [30]. The five-dimensional\n\n\u2032\nmetric is now of Euclidean signature and when we dualize the 4-form F(4)\nto a scalar field\n\nstrength \u03c7\u2032 we obtain a positive kinetic term for this scalar. We expect to be able to relate\nthis theory to a timelike reduction of a truncated six-dimensional Type IIB\u2217 theory by applying the T -duality rules given above. Now, it is known that the action of Type IIB\u2217 in ten\ndimensions is obtained from the usual Type IIB action after we reverse the signs of the RR\nkinetic terms. As the sign of such kinetic terms was irrelevant when discussing the truncation\nto six dimensions we see that a consistent truncation of Type IIB\u2217 in six dimensions will be\ngiven by the Lagrangian (B-1) in which we must reverse the sign on the kinetic terms for the\nRR\nRR fields, i.e. we must reverse the sign of the kinetic terms for F(3)\nand also for \u03c72 (which\n\nappears from the dualisation of the RR field B(4) ). When performing a timelike dimensional\nreduction the final Type IIB\u2217 Lagrangian will be similar with (B-8) with reverted signs for\nRR\nNS\n, F(2)1\nrespectively F(2) . It is then straightforward to see that\nthe kinetic terms of \u03c72 , F(3)\n\nthe T -duality will relate our truncated Type IIA theory with the truncated Type IIB\u2217 . It is\n25\n\n\feasy to extend the above considerations to show that a timelike T -duality will relate Type\nIIB with Type IIA\u2217 at the level of our truncated theories. Also Type IIA\u2217 and Type IIB\u2217\nare related by a usual T -duality along a spacelike direction.\n\nReferences\n[1] Rafael D. Sorkin \"Kaluza-Klein Monopole\" Phys. Rev. Lett.
