Introduction\nAstrophysical observations made, by end of the last century and beginning of this century, have conclusive evidence for late cosmic acceleration [1, 2]. It is driven by an unknown fluid violating strong energy\ncondition (SEC) such that 1 + 3w < 0 with w being the ratio of pressure density p and energy density \u03c1. This exotic fluid is known as dark\nenergy (DE). In 2002-2003, Caldwell argued that experimental observations favor the case w < \u22121 more than the case w > \u22121 violating the\nweak energy condition (WEC) too. DE, obeying w < \u22121, is dubbed\nas phantom [22]. Using general relativity (GR)-based Friedmann equation, giving cosmic dynamics, it is found that phantom-dominated era\nof the universe accelerates, but ends up in big-rip singularity in a finite future time. One can refer to [4]for detailed review. Later on, in\n[5], using brane-gravity(BG), singularity-free phantom driven cosmic\nacceleration was obtained. After some time, in [6], it is shown that\nGR-based theory also gives accelerating phantom universe if the phantum fluid behaves as barotropic fluid and generalized Chaplygin gas\nsimultaneously.\nIn the race of probe for viable cosmological models satisfying observational constraints and explaining present cosmic acceleration, branegravity was also drawn into service and brane-cosmology was developed. A review on brane-gravity and its various applications with special attention to cosmology is available in[7, 8, 9, 10]. The brane-gravity\nstems from low energy string theory. After development of M-theory ,\nbringing different string-theories under one umbrella, Ho\u0159ova and Witten proposed that 11-dimensional supergravity, which is a supermembrane theory, can be obtained as low-energy limit of 11-dimensional\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n3\n\nM-theory. They discussed that it can be done on a particular orbifold R10 \u2297 S 1 /Z2, where R10 is the 10-dimensional space-time and\nS 1 /Z2 is the 1-dimensional space having x11 \u21c6 \u2212x11 symmetry [11].\nWhen the six extra-dimensions on (1 + 9)-branes are compactified on\nvery small scale close to fundamental scale, their effect is realized on\n(1 + 3)-dimensional brane located at ends of S 1 /Z2. Thus, Ho\u0159ova Witten solution provided an effective 5-dimensional model where extra\ndimension could be large relative to the fundamental scale in contrast\nto Kaluza-Klein approach where extra dimension is very small [12, 13].\nIn the 5-dimensional model, situation is simplified by the idea that\nmatter fields are confined to 4-dimensinal space-time, called 3-brane,\nwhich is our observable universe and major portion of gravity is confined to 5-dimensional \"bulk\". The pioneering work, in this direction,\nwas done by L.Randall and R.Sundrum in their seminal paper to solve\nthe \"hierarchy problem\" by a warped or curved dimension showing that\nfundamental scale can be brought down from the Planck scale to 100\nGeV. Thus, Randall-Sundrum approach brings the theory to low scales\nupto 100 GeV, which is the electroweak scale( so far results could be\nverified experimentally upto this scale only). In this model, extradimension is large having (1 + 3)-branes at its ends. These branes\nare Z2 -symmetric (have mirror symmetry) and have tension to counter\nthe negative cosmological constant in the \"bulk\", which is AdS5 . The\nmodel, having two (1 + 3)-branes at the ends of the orbifold S 1 /Z2 , is\nknown as RS-I model [14].\nIn another paper, in the same year, these authors proposed another\nbrane-model as an alternative to compactification . In this model, there\nis only one (1+3)-brane at one end of the extra-dimension and the other\n\n\f4\n\nS.K.SRIVASTAVA\n\nend tends to infinity. This model is known as RS-II model [15]. Thus,\nHo\u0159ova - Witten solution and RS- theory yielded brane-gravity originating from low-energy string theory, which also explains why gravity\nis weak in the observable universe. In case the extra-dimension is timedependent, brane-gravity induced Friedmann equation (FE)(giving dynamics of the universe) contains a correction term \u03c12 /2\u03bb with \u03bb being\ncalled as brane-tension. In RS-I model, \u03bb is positive, whereas in RS-II\nmodel, \u03bb is negative.\nSo, apart from general relativity (GR)-based models and f (R)\u2212\nmodels, brane-gravity (BG)-based cosmological models were also tried\nupon to explain acceleration in the present and late universe. In particular, RS-II model got much attention due to its simple and rich\nconceptual base [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Here also, we\naddress to RS-II model. In this case, we have energy density terms in\nFE as \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03c1/2|\u03bb|) due to \u03bb < 0. In [5], it is shown that phantomdominated model of the universe based on RS-II model of brane-gravity\naccelerates till \u03c1 = 2|\u03bb| giving late transient acceleration.\nAs mentioned above, in the RS-II model of brane-gravity, Friedmann\nequation gets modified by a correction term \u22124\u03c0G\u03c12 /3\u03bb[7, 8, 9, 10].\nThe present density of dark energy is found to be 0.73\u03c10cr with present\ncritical energy density \u03c10cr = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221247 GeV4 [1, ?]. If the late universe\nis dominated by phantom , present phantom energy density is 0.73\u03c10cr .\nThe brane-tension, in RS-models, are obtained as \u03bb = 48\u03c0/MP2 k52 with\nk52 = 8\u03c0G5 = 8\u03c0/MP2 l and l being the length of the extra-dimsion of\nthe 5-dimensional bulk[8, 9, 10]. Here, we take k52 = 1GeV\u22126 like the\nref.[9], so \u03bb = 48\u03c0/MP2 = 6.03 \u00d7 1010 \u03c10cr . Thus, it is found that, in the\npresent universe, brane-correction term \u22124\u03c0G\u03c12 /3\u03bb is ineffective and\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n5\n\nit may continue so if energy density decreases with the expansion of\nthe future universe. But, phantom fluid is different from other fluids,\nin the sense that, contrary to other fluids, its energy density increases\nwith expansion of the universe due to EOS parameter w < \u22121. So,\nin future, \u03c1 will increase rapidly due to accelerated expansion being\ncomparable to \u03bb. As a result, brane-corrections will be effective in the\nfuture universe being addressed here. This crucial point is elaborated\nmore explicitly in following sections.\nThe present paper aims to explore some other aspects of the universe based on RS-II model of brane-gravity, when it is dominated by\nphantom fluid. In what follows, it is found that phantom characteristic\n( violation of WEC) of the dominating fluid is effective in RS-II model\nso long as \u03c1 < 3|1 + w|\u03bb/(1 + 3|1 + w|) and universe accelerates. \u03c1\nof phantom dark energy grows with cosmic expansion. As it grows to\n\u03c1 \u2265 3|1 + w|\u03bb/(1 + 3|1 + w|), WEC is not violated but SEC is violated\nso long as \u03c1 < (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|)\u03bb and acceleration continues. When \u03c1 \u2265 (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|)\u03bb, SEC is not violated and\neven dark energy property of the fluid is supressed by brane-gravity effects. As a result, universe decelerates. These are some new surprises\nfrom brane-world cosmology in addition to many surprises mentioned\nin [26] .\nHere, natural units ~ = c = 1 are used,where ~ and c have their\nstandard meaning.\n\n2. Strong and weak energy conditions for phantom fluid\nin RS-II model of the universe\n\n\f6\n\nS.K.SRIVASTAVA\n\nObservations support homogeneous and isotropic model for the late\nuniverse [27], given by the anastaz\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t)[dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor.\nIn this space-time, modified Friedmann equation in RS-II model is\ngiven as\n\u03c1i\n8\u03c0G h\n,\n(2a)\n\u03c1 1\u2212\na\n3\n2\u03bb\n= 1019 GeV being the Planck mass in natural\n\u0010 \u0227 \u00112\n\nH2 =\nwith G = MP\u22122 (MP\n\n=\n\nunits), \u03c1 being energy density and brane-tension given as\n\u03bb=\n\n48pi\n= 6.03 \u00d7 1010 \u03c10cr\nMP2\n\n(2b)\n\non taking k52 = 1 as mentioned above [8, 9]. Here \u03c10cr = 2.5\u00d710\u221247 GeV4\nis the critical energy density in the present universe.\nAs mentioned above, observations support dominance of phantom\nfluid in the late universe [22]. So, the equation of state (EOS) of the\ndominating phantom fluid is taken as\np = w\u03c1\n\n(3)\n\nwith w < \u22121.\nThe conservation equation is given by\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H(\u03c1 + p) = 0\n\n(4a)\n\nas it does not contain brane-correction terms [8] .\nSo, for phantom fluid, (4a) looks like\n\u0227\n\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 3 \u03c1|1 + w| = 0\na\nintegrating to\n\u03c1 = 0.73\u03c10cr a3|1+w| ,\n\n(4b)\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n7\n\nwhere the present scale factor a0 is normalized as a0 = 1.\nFrom (2b) and (4b), it is found that, in the present universe, \u03c10 /\u03bb \u2243\n\n1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 \u2248 0. So, brane-correction is not effective in the present\n\nuniverse. But, as phantom energy density will increase with growing\na(t) given by (4b), this situation will improve in future, when scale\nfactor will grow sufficiently such that\na(t)/a0 & [8.26 \u00d7 1010 ]1/3|1+w|\n\n(4c)\n\nwith a0 = a(t0 ) being the present scale factor and t0 being the present\ntime. When it will happen so, \u03c1/\u03bb & 1 and brane-correction terms\nwill be effective in the dynamics of the universe and gradually branecorrections will grow stronger.\nHere, three situations are obtained. As mentioned above. in the\npresent universe, brane-corrections are not effective. This situation will\ncontinue till \u03c1 grows sufficiently. During this period WEC is violated\nand phantom universe will super-accelerate (it is justified at the end of\nthis section). As for \u03c1 << 2\u03bb, universe will suoer-accelerate in future\nand \u03c1 will grow with a(t), it is reasonable to believe \u03c1/\u03bb & 1 to happen\nin future due to rapid increase in a(t) caused by super-acceleration.\nIncrease in \u03c1 will still continue with growing a(t). On further increase\nin \u03c1, upto certain value, brane-corrections will be effective and only\nSEC will be violated. As a consequence, acceleration of the phantom\nuniverse will become comparatively slow. It means that, in this situation, phantom universe will accelerate, but it will not super-accelerate.\nThis is the intermadiate state. When \u03c1 will increase more, none of SEC\nand WEC will be violated due to strong effect of brane-corrections and\nphantom universe will decelerate. Acceleration and super-acceleration\nmanifest anti-gravity effect of dark energy. Here, it is found that that\n\n\f8\n\nS.K.SRIVASTAVA\n\nbrane-corrections, in RS-II model, counter anti-gravity effect of phantom dark energy. In the case of quintessence, \u03c1 decreases with expansion of the universe due to w > \u22121, so brane-corrections can not be\neffective in present and future quintessence universe in RS-II model.\nIn what follows, a detailed analysis is given\nFrom (2a) and (4a), it is obtained that\nh\nn\n\u03c1i\n\u03c1 oi\n4\u03c0G h\n\u00e4\n3(\u03c1 + p) 1 \u2212\n\u2212 2\u03c1 1 \u2212\n,\n=\u2212\na\n3\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\n(5)\n\nThis equation was obtained earlier in [24, 25].\nIn the GR-based theory, (5) looks like\n\u00e4\n4\u03c0G\n=\u2212\n[\u03c1 + 3P ].\na\n3\n\n(6)\n\nComparing (5) and (6), the effective pressure density P is given by\nh\nh\n\u03c1i\n\u03c1i\n\u2212 2\u03c1 1 \u2212\n.\n(7)\n\u03c1 + 3P = 3(\u03c1 + p) 1 \u2212\n\u03bb\n2\u03bb\nUsing the equation of state (3) for phantom fluid, effective equation\n\nof state (EEOS) with brane-gravity corrections is obtained as\nP = \u2212\u03c1 \u2212 |1 + w|\u03c1 +\n\n\u03c12\n(1 + 3|1 + w|),\n3\u03bb\n\n(8)\n\nwhere (1 + w) = \u2212|1 + w| for phantom fluid.\n(8) yields\nh\ni\n\u03c12\n\u03c1 + P = \u2212\u03c1 |1 + w| \u2212 (1 + 3|1 + w|) .\n3\u03bb\n\n(9)\n\nThis equation shows that WEC is violated when \u03c1/\u03bb < 3|1 + w|/(1 +\n3|1 + w|), \u03c1 + P = 0 for \u03c1/\u03bb = 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|) and \u03c1 + P > 0\nfor \u03c1/\u03bb > 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|).\nIt is interesting to note from (4b) and (9) that phantom fluid, dominating the universe, behaves effectively as phantom ie. it violates WEC\ntill \u03c1/\u03bb < 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|), but phantom characterisic to violate\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n9\n\nWEC is suppressed by brane-gravity effects as \u03c1 increases and it obeys\nthe inequality \u03c1/\u03bb > 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|).\nFurther, using (8), it is also obtained that\ni\nh\n\u03c12\n\u03c1 + 3P = \u2212\u03c1 2 + 3|1 + w| \u2212 (1 + 3|1 + w|) .\n\u03bb\n\n(10a)\n\n(10a) shows that SEC is violated when \u03c1/\u03bb < (2+3|1+w|)/(1+3|1+w|),\n\u03c1 + 3P = 0 for \u03c1/\u03bb = (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|) and \u03c1 + 3P > 0 for\n\u03c1/\u03bb > (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|).\nThus, it is obtained that (i) WEC is violated for \u03c1/\u03bb < 3|1 + w|/(1 +\n3|1 + w|), (ii) for 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|) \u2264 \u03c1/\u03bb < (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 +\n3|1 + w|) WEC is not violated, but SEC is violated and (iii) for \u03c1/\u03bb >\n(2+3|1+w|)/(1+3|1+w|) neither of the two conditions is violated. Also\nit is interesting to note that brane-gravity corrections cause phantom\ndivide when \u03c1/\u03bb = 3|1 + w|/(1 + 3|1 + w|) [28].\nUsing these results in (5), it is obtained that universe will accelerate\ntill \u03c1/\u03bb < (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|) as \u00e4 > 0. At \u03c1/\u03bb = (2 + 3|1 +\nw|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|), \u00e4 = 0 and \u03c1/\u03bb > (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|), \u00e4 < 0.\nIt shows that a transition from acceleration to deceleration will take\nplace when \u03c1/\u03bb = (2 + 3|1 + w|)/(1 + 3|1 + w|).\nIn a flat universe, combined analysis of results from WMAP3 and\nthe Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) yields w = \u22120.970.07\n\u22120.09 . If flat\nuniverse is not considered a priori, WMAP3 with large structure and\nsupernova data yield w = \u22121.060.13\n\u22120.08 [30]. Here, for an example, we\ntake a value for w as w = \u22121.06 common to both observational results.\nUsing these values of \u03bb and w, the effective phantom divide is obtained at\n\u03c1 = 1.94 \u00d7 1010 \u03c10cr ,\n\n(10b)\n\n\f10\n\nS.K.SRIVASTAVA\n\ntransition from acceleration to deceleration is obtained when\n\u03c1 = 1011 \u03c10cr ,\n\n(10c)\n\nand it is found that universe will expand till\n\u03c1 = 1.19 \u00d7 1011 \u03c10cr .\n\n(10d)\n\nAccording 16 Type supernova observations [2], acceleration in the\nlate universe started at red shift z\u2217 \u2243 0.46 and a transition from deceleration to acceleration took place. So, the scale factor at this red-shift\nis obtained from\na0\n= 1 + z\u2217 = 1.46.\na\u2217\n\n(10e)\n\n\u03c1 = 0.73\u03c10cr (a/a0 )0.18\n\n(10f )\n\n\u03c1\u2217 = 0.73\u03c10cr (a\u2217 /a0 )0.18 = 0.68\u03c10cr .\n\n(10g)\n\nFrom (4b), we have\n\nusing w = \u22121.06. So,\n\nWhen WEC is violated, from (6), it is obtained that \u00e4/a > 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3\nand 0 < \u00e4/a < 8\u03c0G\u03c1/3, when only SEC is violated. Thus, \u00e4/a\u03c1 is\ngreater during violation of WEC than \u00e4/a\u03c1 during violation of SEC\nonly. It shows supera-acceleration, when WEC is violated and acceleration , when SEC is violated. So, using above numerical values, it is obtained that universe will super-accelerate when \u03c1\u2217 < \u03c1 < 9.198 \u00d7 109 \u03c10cr\nas EEOS for phantom fluid violates WEC during this range of energy density. The universe will accelerate when 9.198 \u00d7 109 \u03c10cr < \u03c1 <\n1.11 \u00d7 1011 \u03c10cr as EEOS for phantom fluid does not violate WEC, but\nviolates SEC ie. phantom fluid behaves effectively as quintessence during this range of \u03c1. The universe will decelerate when 1.11 \u00d7 1011 \u03c10cr <\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n11\n\n\u03c1 < 2.06 \u00d7 1011 \u03c10cr as during this range of \u03c1, neither SEC nor WEC is\nviolated by EEOS of phantom fluid giving \u00e4 < 0.\n3. Acceleration and deceleration of the universe\nSo far, we have obtained different conditions for changes in the behaviour of phantom fluid dominating the RS-II model-based universe\ndue to brane-gravity corrections. In what follows, we derive scale factor\na(t) solving Friedmann equation (2a) and conservation equation (4a).\nIt helps to find time period during which WEC and SEC are violated\nand time period, during which, these are not violated.\nConnecting (2a) and (4a) and using (1 + w) = \u2212|1 + w| for phantom\nfluid, it is obtained that\nr\n\n\u03c1\u0307 \u2212 3|1 + w|\u03c1\n\n8\u03c0G h\n\u03c1i\n= 0.\n\u03c1 1\u2212\n3\n2\u03bb\n\n(11) is integrated to\nnr 1\nh1\no2 i\u22121\n\u221a\n1\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212 6\u03c0G|1 + w|(t \u2212 t\u2217 )\n\u03c1=\n,\n2\u03bb\n\u03c1\u2217 2\u03bb\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u2217 < 2\u03bb is the phantom dark energy density and t\u2217 is the time,\nwhen late universe began to accelerate at red-shift z\u2217 \u2243 0.46 given\nabove.

It behaves effectively like quintessence when\nt1 < t < t2 as (\u03c1 + P ) > 0 and (\u03c1 + 3P ) < 0 during this time interval.\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n13\n\nSo, universe accelerates during the time interval t0 < t < t2 . During\ninterval t2 < t < te , the effective equation of state obeys the condition\n(\u03c1 + 3P ) > 0, so universe decelerates. Thus t = t2 gives the transition\ntime from acceleration to deceleration.\nFrom (15) and (17), it is found that if \u03bb is very large, t2 \u2248 te and\ndeceleration period te \u2212 t2 vanishes. If \u03bb is small , deceleration period\nte \u2212 t2 is significant. It shows that \u03bb has a very crucial role.\nUsing value of \u03bb given by (2b) and w = \u22121.16 in (15) and (16), it is\nobtained that\nt1 = te \u2212 393.19kyr,\nwhere present age of the universe is t0 = 13.7Gyr = 6.6 \u00d7 1041 GeV4 .\nThis result shows that effective phantom divide will be obtained 393.19kyr\nbefore te = 6.1t0 = 83.57Gyr.\nSimilarly, using these numerical values in (15) and (17), we have\nt2 = te \u2212 88.96kyr.\nThis result shows that transition from acceleration to deceleration will\ntake place 88.96kyr before te .\nUsing a = a\u2217 , given by (10f), at t = t\u2217 , (14) yields\nt\u2217 = 0.84t0 = 11.47Gyr,\nwhere above values of \u03bb and w are used. Thus, it is obtained that\nuniverse will super-accelerate during the time period 11.47Gyr < t <\nte \u2212 393.19kyr as EEOS violates WEC during this period, will acceletrate during the period te \u2212 393.19kyr < t < te \u2212 88.96kyr as EEOS\nviolates SEC, but not WEC during this period and will decelerate during the period te \u2212 88.96kyr < t < te as neither WEC nor SEC is\nviolated duting this period.\n\n\f14\n\nS.K.SRIVASTAVA\n\nIn case of RSI model \u03bb is positive, so (2) looks like\n\u0010 \u0227 \u00112 8\u03c0G h\n\u03c1i\n,\n\u03c1 1+\n=\na\n3\n2\u03bb\n\n(19)\n\nIn this case, we have\nh\no2 i\u22121\nnr 1\n\u221a\n1\n1\n\u03c1= \u2212\n,\n(20)\n+\n+\n\u2212 6\u03c0G|1 + w|(t \u2212 t0 )\n2\u03bb\n\u03c10 2\u03bb\nh\nnr 1\noi\u22121/3|1+w|\n1 \u221a\n\u22121/3|1+w| 1\na(t) = a0 \u03c10\n+\n+\n\u2212 6\u03c0G|1 + w|(t \u2212 t0)\n2\u03bb\n\u03c10 2\u03bb\n(21)\nand\n4\u03c0G h\n\u03c1i\n\u00e4\n> 0.\n=\n\u03c1 (2 + 3|1 + w|) + (1 + 3|1 + w|)\na\n3\n\u03bb\n(16) and (17) show big-rip singularity at time\nhr 1\n1i\n1\n+\nts = \u221a\n\u03c10 2\u03bb\n6\u03c0G|1 + w|\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nin RSI model as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, p \u2192 \u221e, when t \u2192 ts as it is obtained in\nmany GR-based models. This type of result for RS-I model was also\nobtained in [31].\n4. Summary\nIt is seen above that if phantom fluid dominates RS-I model of the homogeneous and flat universe, where brane-tension \u03bb is positive, universe\naccelerates and is plagued with big-rip problem like most of the GRbased models [22]. But, in case phantom fluid dominates RS-II model\nof the universe (where \u03bb is negative) brane-gravity corrections make\ndrastic changes in the behaviour of phantom fluid. Unlike RS-I model,\nRS-II model of the phantom universe expands till \u03c1 = 2\u03bb. It is found\nabove that it explains the present cosmic acceleration and exhibits deceleration after a finite time, when energy density grows sufficiently.\nPhantom fluid is characterized by violation of WEC. It is interesting\n\n\fCAN PHANTOM-DOMINATED UNIVERSE ...\n\n15\n\nto see that, in the case of negative \u03bb, brane gravity corrections suppress\nthis characteristic of phantom dark energy as energy density grows with\ntime. When 3|1+w|/(1+3|1+w|) \u2264 \u03c1/\u03bb < (2+3|1+w|)/(1+3|1+w|)\nWEC is not violated, but SEC is violated. It shows that when \u03c1 satisfies\nthis inequality, brane-gravity corrections are so effective that phantom\nfluid behaves as quintessence. When \u03c1 grows more, brane-gravity corrections suppress even dark energy characteristics of the dominating\nfluid and neither SEC nor WEC are violated. As a result, phantom\nuniverse decelerates. Thus, here, it is found that RS-II model based\nphantom universe accelerates in the present time and accelerating phase\ncontinues upto a certain future time, but decelerates later till \u03c1 = 2\u03bb.\nMoreover, it is free from future-ingularity as expansion of this model\nwill stop when \u03c1 = 2\u03bb. It happens so due to negativity of the branetension.\nAcknowledgement\nAuthor is thankful to S.D.Odintsov for useful suggestions and comments.\nReferences\n[1] S. J. Perlmutter et al., Astrophys.
