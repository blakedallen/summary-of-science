Two types of\ngames, each played by only one player, are involved denoted as game A and\ngame B. In the former only one biased coin is used while in the latter two\nbiased coins are used with the player's current capital determining the state\ndependent rule. On average, when played individually each game causes the\nplayer to lose. However, when two games are played in any combination, on\naverage the player always wins. More specifically, in game A a biased coin\nwith probability of landing head up is pA < 1/2, and assuming that the initial\ncapital is C = 0, after n plays the expected value of the capital is hCi = n(2\npA \u2212 1) < 0. The game B is played with coins B0 and B1 with probabilities of\nlanding head up of p0 and p1 respectively. The coin B0 is flipped when C \u2261\n0(mod 3) and coin B1 otherwise. The quantities of the Brownian ratchets may\nbe made analogous to the variables figuring in Parrondo's games. For example,\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n1 October 2018\n\n\fthe displacement of the particles corresponds to the capital amount after a\ncertain number of games. The potential of the Brownian ratchets (usually\nelectrostatic) is analogous to the games rules, which define the shape of the\npotential. A comprehensive review of Parrondo's paradox and references is\ngiven in [2].\nSeveral variations of these games have been introduced extending the range of\napplicability of games possessing the same, apparently paradoxical property as\nthe original ones. In [3], capital dependence in game B was replaced by recent\nhistory of wins and loses which in turn inspired the setting in [4] where the\ncapital dependence in game B was replaced by spatial neighbor dependence.\nThe latter games, termed cooperative, are played by N number of players as a\ncontrast to the original games which are played by only one player. Each of N\nplayers, arranged in a circle (since periodic boundary conditions are assumed),\nowns a capital Ci (t), i = 1, ..., N, which evolves by combined playing of games\nA and B. Game A is the same as in the original setup, namely it consists of\nrepeatedly flipping a biased coin A so that the cumulative capital of all players\ndecreases in time. Game B depends on the winning or losing state of the\nneighbors on both sides of the player whose turn is to play. It was shown that\nthe outcome is the same as in the original games, namely that alternation of\ngames A and B, which may be losing or fair when played individually, leads to a\nwinning temporal evolution of the total capital of all players. Recognizing that\nthe spatial dependent games may be played in an asynchronous manner (each\nplayer, chosen randomly or in any other way, plays when his turn comes) and in\na synchronous manner (all players play at the same time), we have developed a\ntheoretical, discrete-time Markov chain model of cooperative games with exact\nrules that allow computation of transition probabilities for arbitrary number\nof players [5], [6]. For these games, termed one-dimensional asynchronous and\none-dimensional synchronous games, rigorous results were obtained for a small\nnumber of players (N \u2264 12) since analytical expressions increase in complexity\nfor larger N. Exploration of paradoxical properties of cooperative Parrondo's\ngames naturally extends to the two-dimensional case which may prove to be\nof considerable practical importance, surpassing from that aspect the onedimensional case. As will be shown in this exposition two-dimensional games\nshare some properties with the one-dimensional ones, namely the probabilities\nfor which the paradox occurs depend on the number of players. Moreover, the\nparadox occurs for a large number of sets of which a fairly large quantity\nexists in the vicinity of probability values corresponding to the well know\nvoter model 1 .\n\n1\n\nThe voter model is a simple mathematical model of opinion formation in which\nvoters are located at the nodes of a network. Each voter has an opinion (in the\nsimplest case either 0 or 1), and randomly chosen voter assumes an opinion of the\nmajority of its neighbors\n\n2\n\n\fThe paper is organized in the following manner: Following a short presentation of essential rules of the games, we show how a probability transition\nmatrix may be obtained from the corresponding matrix of the one dimensional\ncase. Results of computer simulations for the asynchronous and synchronous\ncases are presented next and we conclude with suggestions for possible new\ndirections and applications of these games.\n\n2\n\nFeatures of the Games\n\n2.1 Rules and mathematical notation\nEach player (or a spin-like particle) may be in one of two states: state 0\n(\"loser\") or state 1 (\"winner\"). The state of the ensemble of M players, in\none-dimensional case, may be represented as a binary string s = (s1 , ..., sM ),\nsi \u2208 (0, 1) of length M, or equivalently, as state s in decimal notation. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed so that sM +1 = s1 . To each state s\ncorresponds a vector equivalent to a basis vector |si in P = 2M dimensional\nstate space\nSP = {|si | s = 0, 1, ..., P \u2212 1}.\nFor example, when M = 3 and P = 8, state (011) is equivalent to the state\n3, and the corresponding vector is |3i = (00010000)T , while state (111) is\nequivalent to state 7 and the corresponding vector is |7i = (00000001)T .\nIt is easy to generalize this representation to a two dimensional M \u00d7N array\nof players located at the nodes of a two-dimensional lattice, in which case\nthe dimension of the state space becomes P = 2M \u00d7N . For example in the\nsimplest configuration when there are 4 players arranged in a 2\u00d7 2 lattice, the\nstate space is 16-dimensional and the correspondences are illustrated by the\nfollowing examples:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8ec0 0\uf8f7\n\n00\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8ec1 0\uf8f7\n\n10\n\n= (0 0 0 0), in decimal notation 0; \u2190\u2192 |0i = (1000000000000000)T\n\n= (1 0 1 0), in decimal notation 10; \u2190\u2192 |10i = (0000000000100000)T\n\nGame A is the same as in the classical setup, while probabilities of winning\nin game B depend on the present state of the left and right neighbors (onedimensional case) or the four nearest neighbors (two-dimensional case). For\nthe two-dimensional case five possible configurations of neighboring players\nsurrounding the player whose turn is to play the game is presented in Fig. 1.\n3\n\n\fConfiguration of neighboring players may be denoted as an ordered set (sj\u22121\nsk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ), where the indices k \u2212 1, k + 1, j \u2212 1 and j + 1 denote the\nstate of neighbors to the left, right, up and below respectively, of a player\nwho is about to play the game. Hence, the probabilities corresponding to\nconfigurations presented in Fig. 1 are:\n(B)\n\nwhen (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) = (0 0 0 0)\n\n(B)\n\nwhen (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) = (0 0 0 1)\n\n(B)\n\nwhen (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) = (0 0 1 1)\n\n(B)\n\nwhen (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) = (0 1 1 1)\n\n(B)\n\nwhen (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) = (1 1 1 1).\n\n\u2022 p0\n\n\u2022 p1\n\n\u2022 p2\n\n\u2022 p3\n\n\u2022 p4\n\n(B)\n\nIt should be remarked that p1 applies to any state with only\none winner in the neighborhood, so that, from the aspect of the player who\nis about to play, the states (0 0 0 1), (0 0 1 0), (0 1 0 0) and (1 0 0 0) are\nequivalent (or four fold degenerate). States (0 0 1 1) and (0 1 1 1) are six and\nfour fold degenerate respectively.\n2.2 Evolution of Probabilities\nWinning or losing in any particular game leaves a player in state 1 (\"winner\")\nor state 0 (\"loser\") respectively. This state remains in effect until he gets a\nrandom chance to play again in the case of asynchronous play or it changes in\neach round of synchronous games. Following a play by one of the players, the\nstate of the ensemble has changed from a state s(t) at time t to state s(t + 1)\nat time t + 1. If the probability that an ensemble in state s(t) (or |s(t)i) is\n\u03c0 s (t), then the probability distribution \u03c0(t) at time t is:\n|\u03c0(t)i =\n\nP\nX\n\n\u03c0 s (t) |si ,\n\n(1)\n\ns=0\n\nwhile the corresponding probability distribution evolution equation is\n|\u03c0(t + 1)i = T |\u03c0(t)i ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T is the probability transition matrix.\nCapital C(t) is a function of the ensemble of players which is incremented\nby 1 or decremented by 1 if one of the players wins or loses respectively. We\nintroduce the vector of the capital |Ci whose components (their number is\nequal to the number of ensemble states) represent the capital generated by\neach ensemble state. Each component Cs of |Ci represents normalized capital\n4\n\n\fgenerated by that specific state which is equal to the sum of all winning and\nlosing individual states in a given ensemble state. Hence, the state 0 generates\ncapital \u22121, while the state 1 generates capital +1. Explicitly,\nCs =\n\nN\u0304\n1 X\n(\u22121)si +1 ,\nN\u0304 i=1\n\n(3)\n\nso that the elements of |Ci are average values of the capital generated by each\nensemble state separately. For example for N\u0304 = M \u00d7 N = 4, the vector of the\ncapital is\n|Ci = 1/4 (\u22124 \u2212 2 \u2212 2 0 \u2212 2 0 0 2 \u2212 2 0 0 2 0 2 2 4)T .\n\n(4)\n\nThe fifth component of |Ci , for example, \u22122 corresponds to the state 4 = (0\n1 0 0). The ensemble switching from any state s(t) to the state s(t + 1) =\n4, generates an average capital |C(t + 1)i = hC | 4i = \u22122/4 = \u22121/2. Furthermore, an ensemble remaining in state 4 throughout its temporal evolution\nwould on the average generate capital \u22121/2 in each turn of the game. Hence,\nthe average capital generated by the ensemble is\nhCi = hC | \u03c0i .\n\n(5)\n\nDenoting the probabilities of wining or losing in a certain game by Pwin and\nPlose it is easily noticed that\nPwin + Plose = 1,\nPwin \u2212 Plose = hCi ,\nso that\n\n3\n\n1\nPwin = (1 + hCi).\n2\n\n(6)\n\nProbability Transition Matrix\n\n3.1 Asynchronous case\nProbability transition matrix for game A may be easily derived from the one\ncorresponding to game B, so the later will be derived first. Since at each\nmoment of time only one player plays and consequently changes the state, the\nchange may be represented by a Hamming distance between the initial (i) and\nthe final (f ) state of player k:\nH\n\nd =\n\nN\u0304\nX\n\n|ik \u2212 fk | ,\n\ns=0\n\n5\n\n\fwhere N\u0304 = M \u00d7 N, the number of players. Since dH may be either 0 or 1,\neach case will be considered separately.\n\n3.1.1 case 1: dH = 0\nIf the ensemble is in state s, then the k-th player is in state sk . State s of the\nensemble also defines the neighborhood \u03b7 k : (sj\u22121 sk\u22121 sj+1 sk+1 ) of the k-th\nplayer, which in turn determines the probability of winning. The ensemble\ninitially in state i may switch to the state f = i in one of N\u0304 different ways as\na result of one of the players switching from state ik to fk = ik , so that the\nprobability of transition is equal to the sum of probabilities of independent\nevents\nN\u0304\n1 X\nTf i = w(i \u2192 f ) =\nw(ik , fk ),\n(7)\nN k=1\nwith\nw(ik , fk ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1 \u2212 p(B) ,\n\u03b7k\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nwhen fk = 0\n\np\u03b7(B)\n, when fk = 1\nk\n\n3.1.2 case 1: dH = 1\nThe k-th player switches from state ik to state fk (ik 6= fk ), with probability\nTf i = w(i \u2192 f ) =\n\n1\nw(ik , fk ).\nN\n\nThe size of the probability transition matrix becomes large even for the case of\nnine players arranged in a 3\u00d7 3 lattice since the dimension of the state space\nis 29 = 512, imposing a 512 \u00d7512 matrix size. As in the one-dimensional case\nthis matrix is sparse for the asynchronous game B while for synchronous game\nall the elements are non-zero.\n\n3.1.3 An example\n(B)\n\nWe illustrate the evaluation of Tf i for the simple case of 3 \u00d7 3 lattice, in the\ncase of transition from state 85 to state 95, i.e.\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec0 0 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8ec0 0 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\n= (0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1) \u2192 \uf8ec 0 1 1 \uf8f7 = (0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1).\n1 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n111\n101\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f7\n\n6\n\n\uf8f7\n\n\fEvaluation of expression 7 for this case yields:\n1\nT 95 85 = [prob(0 \u2192 0) + prob(0 \u2192 0) + prob(1 \u2192 1)\n9\n+prob(0 \u2192 0) + prob(1 \u2192 1) + prob(0 \u2192 1)\n+prob(1 \u2192 1) + prob(0 \u2192 1) + prob(1 \u2192 1)\n= [(1 \u2212 p2 ) + (1 \u2212 p2 ) + p1 + (1 \u2212 p2 ) + p0 +\np3 + p1 + p3 + p2\n1\n= (3 + p0 + 2p1 \u2212 2p2 + 2p3 ).\n9\nOther elements may be derived in a similar manner.

First, players may simultaneously play game\nA or game B in any predetermined or random order, and this case is denoted\nby A+B. The other possibility is that each player may at each turn of the\ngame chose randomly whether to play game A or game B, this case being\ndenoted as A*B. In both cases the paradoxical result that games A+B or\nA*B may be winning while each game, A and B, individually losing persists,\nhowever for different sets of probabilities figuring in game B.\n7\n\n\f4\n\nResults of simulations\n\n4.1 Capital accumulation as a function of time\n\nIn Figs.2 and 3 the averaged capital as a function of time in games A, B and\nA+B for the asynchronous and synchronous cases is shown, respectively. In\nthe synchronous case, Fig. 3, the paradoxical property becomes visible in a\nvery short amount of time, while the asynchronous case displays paradoxical\nproperty following a short period during which game A fluctuates around a\nfair outcome while game B experiences a transient in the positive direction.\n\n4.2 Probability space defining the paradox\n\nThe results were obtained both by direct numerical simulation and calculations\nbased on the analytically derived expressions for the probability transition\nmatrix. As in the one-dimensional setting, the results show perfect agreement\nas illustrated in Fig. 4, where the averaged capital isis shown as a function of\n(B)\nprobability p1 for the case asynchronously played games. In this diagram a\nA*B choice for the alternation of two games is applied. In all simulations the\ncapital pertaining to the asynchronous games was averaged over 10 000 time\nsteps and over 1000 runs (ensembles). For synchronous case, since all players\nplay at each time step, the averaging was performed over 1000 time steps\nand over 200 runs (ensembles). In the case of calculations based on analytical\nexpressions for the probability transition matrix, the capital was averaged\nas in the case of synchronous games. Simulations of the capital evolution in\nthe five dimensional probability space show that the paradox occurs for a\nvery large number of sets and in order to illustrate this, we concentrate on\nthe appearance of the paradox in the vicinity of the voter model values, i.e.\n(B)\n(B)\n(B)\n(B)\n(B)\np0 = 0, p1 = 0.25, p2 = 0.5, p3 = 0.75 and p4 = 1. The obtained\nprobability sets are displayed in Table 1.\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\nAs a further illustration, the probability space spanned by p1 and p3 and\nthe corresponding paradoxical range are shown in Fig. 4. Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and\n10 further illustrate the paradoxical property of the games through capital\nevolution as a function of each of the probabilities determining the state of\nthe player who is about to play game B. In each of the figures one probability\nwas varied while the remaining four were kept constant. The region of the\nparadox is enlarged and shown in the right diagram.\n8\n\n\f(B)\n\np0\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\np1\n\np2\n\np3\n\np4\n\n0\n\n0.15\n\n0.6\n\n0.75\n\n0.95\n\n0\n\n0.15\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.55\n\n0.8\n\n0.65\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.95\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.95\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.6\n\n0.75\n\n0.85\n\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\n0.6\n\n0.75\n\n0.9\n\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\n0.55\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nTable 1\nProbabilities featured in game B leading to the paradox in the vicinity of the voter\nmodel values\n\n4.3 Capital accumulation and lattice size\n\nIn the next two figures we compare the way the capital, as a function of prob(B)\nability p2 , depends on the size of the lattice. In Fig. 11, this dependence is\npresented for the asynchronous game B. In the cases where periodic boundary conditions have large influence (small lattice sizes, e.g. 3 \u00d7 3) the capital\nincreases linearly and in a noticeable manner. The same behavior is seen for\nlarge lattice sizes (e.g. 100 \u00d7 100 and larger) were periodic boundary conditions do not play an important role. However for intermediate lattice sizes\n(from 10 \u00d7 10 up to 50 \u00d7 50) the capital increases substantially only in the\n(B)\n(approximate) range 0.5 \u2264 p2 \u2264 0.7. For values on both sides of this range\ncapital increases very slowly.\nFor synchronous games this dependence on the lattice size is not distinct, so\n(B)\nthat the capital increases, as a function of probability p2 , in almost the same\nmanner and up to the same value for all lattice sizes (Fig. 12).\nIt is interesting that asynchronous game B played at intermediate lattice sizes\n(B)\nleads to the same functional dependence of the capital on the probability p2\nas in synchronous games.\n9\n\n\f4.4 Percolation phase transition\n\nThe dynamics of the games suggests that one should investigate whether there\nis a connection between the paradoxical property of the games with the percolation phase transition. A typical snapshot of the configuration of \"winners\"\nand losers\" which arises during the course of the game B is shown in Fig. 13.\nIn Fig. 14 we superpose two graphs. The first one shows the capital depen(B)\ndence in games B, A+B and A*B on the probability p2 , so that the area of\nthe paradox ( C (B) < 0 and C (A+B) > 0 or C (A\u2217B) < 0) is clearly visible. The\nsecond graph illustrates the probability of appearance of the spanning cluster\n(B)\nin game B as a function of p2 . The percolation phase transition occurs at\n(B)\n(B)\nthe value of p2C \u2243 0.64 very close to the range of p2 values for which the\n(B)\nparadox occurs (approximately 0.59 \u2264 p2 \u2264 0.62) however it is clear that the\n(B)\nparadox is not present at p2C . The simulation presented here as a paradigm\nof the typical property of the games, was performed for the 50 \u00d7 50 lattice\nsize.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nFollowing a discrete-time Markov chain model of one-dimensional cooperative\nParrondo's games introduced previously, we analyzed the we analyzed the twodimensional setting characterized by players arranged at a two-dimensional\nregular lattice. It was shown that the alternation of two losing games, on average, leads to a winning outcome and the number of probability sets for which\nthis apparently paradoxical property occurs is very large. In particular, there\nis a number of probability sets very close to the values characteristic of the\nvoter model, suggesting possible applications in the social or economic framework. Moreover, asynchronous games displaying the paradoxical property are\nsensitive to the lattice size (number of players), while this is not the case\nwith the synchronous games. For medium sized lattices (between 10 \u00d710 to\n50 \u00d750), the capital evolution as a function of one of the probabilities defining\ngame B behaves in a similar manner for asynchronous and synchronous games.\nPercolation phase transition for game B occurs at the probability value very\nclose to the probability values for which the paradox occurs, however they\nseem to be unrelated phenomena. No fronts or patterns were observed at the\nparadoxical probability values.\nAn interesting extension of this work pertains to the games where players\nare arranged on a network nodes and where links with the neighbors may be\nrewired according to specific rules[7]. In this setting an addition of rewiring\nprobability in game B introduces interesting novel features of the dynamics\n10\n\n\falong with the existence of the paradox.\n\nReferences\n[1] G. P.
