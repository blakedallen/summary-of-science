There is a number of experimental observables to identify this transition, such as strangeness enhancement, charmonium suppression, event anisotropy, fluctuation in particles ratios, transverse momenta etc. At the\nsame time, it has also been recognized that no single signal alone can provide clear evidence for the existence of the phase transition. This stimulates the search for new probes\nto investigate the properties of hot and dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions at\nhigh energies.\nOne of the new signature can be the change of in the polarization properties of the\nsecondary particles in the nucleus-nucleus collisions compared to the nucleon-nucleon collisions. A number of polarization observables have been proposed as a possible signature\nof phase transition, namely, decreasing of the \u039b0 transverse polarization in central collisions [1, 2], non-zero \u039b\u03040 longitudinal polarization [3, 4], non-zero J/\u03a8 polarization at\nlow pT [5], anisotropy in di-electron production from vector mesons decay [6] (and references therein), global hyperon polarization [7] and spin-alignment of vector mesons [8] in\nnon-central events etc.\nThe strangeness enhancement is considered as one of the signal of the phase transition\nfrom ordinary matter to quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The strong strangeness enhancement\nat \u223c30 GeV*A as well as the change of the slope of the strange particles spectra have\nbeen firstly observed by the NA49 collaboration both in kaon [9] and hyperon [10] data.\nIn this respect the study of the polarization properties of the hyperons at the energies\n\u221a\nsN N of several GeV is of greate interest.\nHowever, in spite of the large amount of the data on the \u039b0 production obtained at\nGSI [11], AGS [12, 13, 14], SPS [10] and RHIC [15]-[19], there are only few results on the\n\u039b0 polarization in nucleus-nucleus interaction [20, 21, 22, 23].\nThe goal of present article is to summarize the existing experimental data and to\ndiscuss the possibility of the \u039b0 polarization measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions\n\u221a\nat sN N of several GeV at future setups.\n\n2\n\n\u039b0 polarization in proton-induced reactions\n\nSince the first observation of large transverse polarization of \u039b0 hyperon [24, 25] in inclusive nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-nuclei interactions, there has been permanent interest\nto the origin of this effect. A significant amount of the data on \u039b0 polarization has been\n\n\faccumulated at different nucleon initial energies between 6 and \u223c2000 GeV [26]. All these\nmeasurements indicated that the high energy hyperon polarization is a function only of\nthe hyperon transverse momentum pT and the fraction of the beam energy carried by the\nfinal state hyperon xF . The magnitude of the polarization at fixed xF rises with pT to a\nplateau at about 1 GeV/c, and the size of the plateau increases monotonically with xF .\nA minor dependence of the \u039b polarization on the A-value of the target has been observed.\nMost of the models explain the \u039b0 polarization by the recombination of a polarized squark with an unpolarized (ud) spectator diquark. In this case the spin of \u039b0 is carried\nby the produced s- quark and that the u and d quarks can be thought of as being coupled\ninto a diquark with zero total angular momentum and isospin.\nIn the framework of the semiclassical recombination model of DeGrand-Miettinen [27]\nthe \u039b0 polarization is defined by the slow s- quark spin precession. According to this\nmodel \u039b0 polarization is expressed as following\nP\u039b0 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 3\u03be(x)\n12\n*\n* pT ,\n2\n\u2206x0 M [1 + 3\u03be(x)]2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nM2 =\n\nm2D + p2T D m2s + p2T s\n+\n\u2212 m2\u039b0 \u2212 p2T\n1 \u2212 \u03be(x)\n\u03be(x)\n\n(2)\n\nwith mD , pT D (ms , pT s ) the mass and transverse momentum of the ud diquark (s quark),\nm\u039b0 and pT the mass and transverse momentum of the \u039b0 , \u2206x0 a distance scale and\n\u03be(x) = xs /x the ratio of the longitudinal momentum of the s quark to the longitudinal\nmomentum fraction of the \u039b0 with respect to the beam proton.\nThe parametrization taken in the form\n1\n\u03be(x) = (1 \u2212 x) + 0.1x\n3\n\n(3)\n\ngives a quantitative description for the \u039b0 polarization in nucleon-nucleus interaction a\nwide energy range [24, 25, 26].\n\n3\n\n\u039b0 polarization in heavy-ion collisions\n\nIn the case of relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, the expectation is that, \u039b0 's coming\nfrom the region where the critical density for QGP formation has been achieved, are\nproduced through the coalescence of independent slow sea u, d and s quarks. Therefore,\nthe plasma creates \u039b0 with zero polarization [2]. Finally, in the case of QGP formation\nthe depolarization effect compare to proton-induced reaction should be observed. The\n\n\ftotal cross section of \u039b0 production versus impact parameter b is the sum of the cross\nsections for the peripherical collisions and QGP regions [2]\nd2 \u03c3\u039bP0ER d2 \u03c3\u039bQGP\nd2 \u03c3\u039b0\n0\n=\n+\n.\n2\n2\n2\ndb\nd b\ndb\nSince \u039b0 's from QGP zone have a zero polarization one can write:\nP\u039b0 =\n\nP\u039bP0ER\n,\n1 + f (b)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nd2 \u03c3\u039bQGP\nd2\u03c3\u039bP0ER\n0\n/\n,\n(6)\nd2 b\nd2 b\nwhere f (b) is defined as the ratio of the differential cross sections for \u039b0 production from\nthe QGP and recombination processes.\nf (b) =\n\nThe behavior of f (b) as a function of impact parameter b for RHIC energies is shown\nin Fig.1 [2]. One can expect up to 30\u201340% of the depolarization effect for the central\nevents. It is shown that the measurable depolarization effect can be observed at the \u039b0\ntransverse momenta pT \u22650.6\u20130.8 GeV/c.\nThe measurements of \u039b0 transverse polarization in nucleus-nucleus collisions [20, 21,\n22] have shown that the produced \u039b0 's are still polarized at freeze-out that means the spin\ndirection is only little affected by the rescattering phase after hadronization. However,\nthere was no scan versus the centrality in this experiment.\nAnother novel phenomena is so called global polarization [7, 8]. System in the noncentral collisions have large orbital angular momentum, which manifests in the polarization\nof secondary particles along the direction of the system angular momentum.\nParton interaction in noncentral relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions leads to the\nglobal polarization of the produced quarks. This value for RHIC energies can be about\n30% and would lead to the global polarization of hyperons [7]. More realistic calculations\n[28] within a model based on the hard termal loop gluon propagator predict the value of\nhyperon polarization to be in the range from -0.03 to 0.15 depending on the temperature\nof the QGP formed. Recent calculations [29, 30] also explain the small value of the global\n\u039b0 polarization observed at RHIC [23].\n\n4\n\nMethod of the \u039b0 polarization measurement\n\nThe \u039b0 hyperon has spin 1/2. It decays to p + \u03c0 \u2212 with 64% branching ratio. The\nanalysis of the angular distribution can be used to obtain the polarization value. The\nmain method to measure \u039b0 polarization in nucleus-nucleus collisions is the measurement\nof the emission angle distribution of the decay proton with respect to the system orbital\nmomentum L.\n\n\fThe definition of the different angles for \u039b0 - hyperon decay is given in Fig.2. Here\nx, y, z are the laboratory frame axes. The reaction plane is defined by the vectors of\nthe initial beam direction z and impact parameter b. L is the system orbital momentum\nnormal to the reaction plane. p\u2217 and \u03b8\u2217 are the proton three-momentum and the angle\nbetween the system orbital momentum L and the three-momentum of the proton in the\n\u039b0 rest frame, respectively. \u03a8RP is the reaction plane angle.\nThe decay proton distribution as a function of emission angle \u03b8\u2217 is expressed as\ndN\n= N0 (cos\u03b8\u2217 )(1 + \u03b1P\u039b cos\u03b8\u2217 ),\n(7)\ndcos\u03b8\u2217\nwhere P\u039b is the value of \u039b0 polarization, \u03b8\u2217 is the angle in the \u039b0 rest frame between the\n\nsystem orbital momentum L which is normal to the reaction plane and the decay proton,\n\u03b1 is an s \u2212 p-wave interference term factor which is measured to be 0.642, N0 (cos\u03b8\u2217 ) is\n\nthe constant corrected for the geometry, efficiency etc. The polarization is defined as the\nslope of the dN/dcos\u03b8\u2217 vs cos\u03b8\u2217 .\n\nThe global polarization of the hyperons measured at RHIC [23] is defined as the\npolarization P\u039b averaged over the relative azimuthal angle\n\n3\n< cos\u03b8\u2217 > .\n(8)\n\u03b1\nOne can write global polarization in terms of the reaction plane angle \u03a8RP and the\nP\u039bG =\n\nazimuthal angle \u03c6\u2217p of the proton three-momentum in the \u039b0 rest frame using the relation\namong the angles shown in Fig.2 which is cos\u03b8\u2217 = sin\u03b8p\u2217 sin(\u03c6\u2217p \u2212 \u03a8RP ) and integrating\nover the angle \u03b8p\u2217\n8\n< sin(\u03c6\u2217p \u2212 \u03a8RP ) > .\n\u03c0\u03b1\nThe expression (9) is similar to that used for the directed flow measurements.\nP\u039bG =\n\n5\n\n(9)\n\nFeasibility of \u039b0 polarization measurement at high\nenergies\n\nFrom UrQMD transport model one can expect production of approximately 20 \u039b0 's decaying into p\u03c0 \u2212 pair in the central Au \u2212 Au collisions at 25 GeV*A.\nThe important feature of CBM setup [31] is quite large acceptance for the detection\nof the both protons and pions. Therefore, it is possible to detect the \u039b0 - hyperons with\nlarge transverse momenta pT , where maximal effect in polarization properties is expected.\nSilicon Tracking System (STS) consisted of 7 or 8 stations can provide the good\ntracking with the expected good enough efficiency. Since \u039b0 is weakly decaying particle (c\u03c4 =7.89 cm), its decay vertex is well separated from the primary vertex. However, it\n\n\fis necessary to provide high efficiency of the secondary tracks finding. The selection of \u039b0 hyperons at CBM can be done without the secondary particles identification to increase\nthe acceptance. In this case the main source of the background is KS0 meson decaying\ninto \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair.\nThe detailed feasibility study of the \u039b0 - hyperon production at CBM [32] has been\nperformed using track reconstruction based on the cellular automata method [31]. The\nmass and longitudinal secondary vertex resolutions achieved were M\u039b \u223c 0.85 MeV/c2 and\n0.8 mm, respectively.\nAn alternative approach has been developed in ref.[33]. Special V 0 - particles (\u039b0\nand KS0 ) finder has been developed using track reconstruction based on the conformal\nmapping and approximate solution of motion equation [34]. The precision of secondary\nvertex reconstruction was \u223c 150 \u03bcm and \u223c 100 \u03bcm for \u039b0 and KS0 , respectively. The\n\nsimple V 0 - fit used the energy and momentum conservation laws only\nEV 0 = E + + E \u2212\np~V 0 = p~\n\n+\n\n+ p~\n\n\u2212\n\n(10)\n\nwith the fixed values of the V 0 - particles masses [35]. The purity of \u039b0 - hyperons selection\nwith simple V 0 - fit is shown in Fig.3 as a function of the longitudinal vertex position. One\ncan see that the purity of \u039b0 's selection is about 0.97 for the decay longitudinal vertex\nposition larger than 5 mm.\nThe y \u2212 pT acceptance for reconstructed \u039b0 's from Au \u2212 Au central collisions at\n25 GeV*A for the conditions of CBM experiment is shown in Fig.4.\nHowever, the measurement of the \u039b0 polarization requires good knowledge of the\nkinematical parameters of the \u039b0 , as well as the reaction plane and centrality value. The\nlatest two parameters at CBM can be measured by zero degree calorimeter [36] with good\nprecision. The V 0 - fitter [33] improves significantly the parameters of the \u039b0 hyperons.\nThe momentum and angular resolutions achieved are \u03b4 p/p \u223c0.37%, \u03c3\u03b2 \u223c0.13 mrad and\n\u03c3tan \u03b1 \u223c0.13, respectively. The precision of secondary vertex reconstruction was better\n\nthan \u223c 70 \u03bcm. The distributions on the reconstructed momentum, angles and vertex\nposition for \u039b0 's are given in Fig.5.\n\nThe collider mode provides more symmetrical acceptance for \u039b0 hyperons, that is\nsignificant for the proper reconstruction of the polarization. The y \u2212 pT ideal acceptance\n\u221a\nfor \u039b0 's from Au\u2212Au central collisions at sN N = 7.1 GeV for the collider mode (assuming\nthe axial symmetry of MPD [37]) is show in Fig.6. Since no particle identification is\nrequired the transverse momenta pT achieved can be large enough to measure sizable\npolarization effects for \u039b0 's production. The reaction plane and impact parameter at\nMPD [37] can be measured with zero degree calorimeter assumed to be the same as\n\n\fat CBM setup or via charged particles energy flow reconstructed in the time-projection\nchamber.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe measurement of the \u039b0 polarization in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the energies of\nFAIR and NICA can be a new important tool in addition the traditional ones to study\nthe phase transition.\nIt is shown the feasibility of the \u039b0 selection in Au \u2212 Au collisions at 25 GeV*A\n\nfor the fixed target experiment [31]. The study of the polarization effects in hyperon\nproduction for the collider mode [37] at the same energies has certain advantages and\ncould be promising.\nAuthors thank Prof. A.I.
