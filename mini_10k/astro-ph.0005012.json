Although HVCs are often described in\nterms of their H I 21 cm emission and their peculiar velocities7 with respect to the motions of the\ngeneral interstellar medium, the traditional view of HVCs as completely neutral entities has given\nway to one that recognizes the importance of an ionized component to many of the clouds. H\u03b1\nemission has been detected toward several large HVC complexes (Tufte, Reynolds, & Haffner 1998;\nBland-Hawthorn et al. 1998; Weiner & Williams 1996), and recent absorption line observations\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope have shown that some HVCs are almost fully ionized (Sembach et\nal. 1995, 1999).\nUnderstanding the ionization of HVCs is a key step toward a more complete description of\nthe high velocity gas. The large peculiar velocities of HVCs make them excellent candidates for\nstudying hot gas within the clouds and their surrounding environments. A prime diagnostic of gas at\ntemperatures T \u223c 105 \u2212 106 K is the O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031.93, 1037.62 doublet, which can be observed in the\nspectra of distant QSOs and AGNs with the newly commissioned the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic\nExplorer (FUSE).\nIn this Letter we report the first detections of O VI absorption in several HVCs located in\ndifferent regions of the sky. The directions considered are listed in Table 1, where we summarize\nsight line characteristics and basic measurements for the HVCs. The reader may find information\nabout the overall extent and distribution of O VI in the Galactic halo in a companion paper (Savage\net al. 2000). A description of the FUSE mission can be found in Moos et al. (2000).\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Processing\n\nThe FUSE data for this investigation were obtained during the commissioning stage of the\nmission in late 1999. Each observation was obtained with the source centered in the 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 30\u2032\u2032\naperture of the LiF1 spectrograph channel. Exposure times ranged from 13 ksec (Ton S210) to\n55 ksec (Mrk 509) (see Savage et al. 2000). The time-tagged photon lists were processed through\nthe standard FUSE calibration pipeline available at the Johns Hopkins University as of November\n1999. The lists were screened for valid data with constraints imposed for earth limb angle avoidance\nand passage through the South Atlantic Anomaly. Corrections for detector backgrounds, Doppler\nshifts caused by spacecraft orbital motions, and geometrical distortions were applied (see Sahnow\net al. 2000). No corrections were made for optical astigmatism aberrations or small spectral shifts\nintroduced by thermal effects since the data were obtained prior to completion of in-orbit focusing\nactivities. The primary effect of omitting these processing steps is to degrade the spectral resolution\nslightly.\nThe processed data have a nominal spectral resolution of 25 km s\u22121 (FWHM), with a relative\n7\nUsually, clouds moving in excess of 100 km s\u22121 with respect to the Local Standard of Rest fall into the category\nof high velocity cloud.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwavelength dispersion solution accuracy of \u223c 6 km s\u22121 (1\u03c3). The zero point of the wavelength\nscale for each observation was determined by registering the H2 (6\u20130) P(3) line at 1031.19 \u00c5 to\nthe velocity of the peak H I 21 cm emission for the sight line. In cases where no H2 absorption is\ndetected, we compared the velocities of the strong Si II \u03bb1020.70 and O I \u03bb1039.23 lines to those\nobserved for lines of the same species at longer wavelengths.\nFully reduced FUSE LiF1A data covering the 1020\u20131045 \u00c5 spectral region are shown for\nPKS 2155-304 and Mrk 509 in Figure 1. Note the presence of negative high velocity O VI 1031.93 \u00c5\nabsorption along both sight lines. O VI \u03bb1037.62 absorption is present in both spectra; however,\nthe HVC components are blended with C II\u2217 \u03bb1037.02. There is also weak, narrow C II \u03bb1036.34\nabsorption toward both objects near the velocities of the O VI HVCs. Other figures showing the\nO VI HVCs considered herein can be found in Savage et al. (2000), Oegerle et al. (2000), and\nMurphy et al. (2000a).\n\n3.\n\nHigh Velocity O VI Measurements\n\nContinuum normalized intensity profiles for the O VI HVC sight lines are presented in Figure 2.\nEquivalent widths and column densities were computed by direct integration of the O VI \u03bb1031.93\nintensity and apparent column density profiles (Sembach & Savage 1992). Na (O VI) [cm\u22122 ] =\nR\n2.748\u00d71012 \u03c4a (v) dv, where \u03c4a (v) is the measured optical depth of the 1031.93 \u00c5 line at velocity v\n(in km s\u22121 ) (Savage & Sembach 1991). We have assumed an oscillator strength f = 0.133 (Morton\n1991). Na (O VI) is a reasonable approximation to N(O VI) since the HVC lines are both weak and\nbroad. The integration ranges lie beyond the velocities expected for O VI absorption arising in the\ngeneral environment of the thick disk and low halo (|z| < 3 kpc) (see Savage et al. 2000). In Table 1\nwe list the fraction of total O VI along each sight line in HVCs, fHV C . On average, fHV C \u223c 30%.\nThe H2 (6\u20130) P(3) 1031.19 \u00c5 and R(4) 1032.35 \u00c5 lines occur at velocities of \u2013214 km s\u22121 and\n+123 km s\u22121 , respectively, relative to the O VI \u03bb1031.93 line. We have modeled the impact of\nthese lines on the observed O VI profiles by examining other H2 (J = 3 or 4) lines in the (3\u20130) to\n(8\u20130) vibrational bands covered by the FUSE LiF1A spectra. Our estimates of the strengths and\nshapes of the P(3) 1031.19 \u00c5 and R(4) 1032.35 \u00c5 lines are shown as heavy solid lines in Figure 2.\nThe values of W\u03bb and log N(O VI) in Table 1 have had the illustrated H2 contributions removed.\n\n4.\n\nHVC Identifications\n\nHigh velocity (VLSR < \u2212100 km s\u22121 ) O VI is seen along 7 of the 11 extended sight lines toward\nAGNs and QSOs observed by FUSE. The HVCs have negative velocities, with the exception of a\nweak HVC detected toward Ton S180 (see Table 1). In many cases, the O VI HVCs can be related\nto H I HVCs located at large distances (>3 kpc) from the Galactic plane.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n4.1.\n\nThe C IV HVCs: Local Group Clouds\n\nHigh velocity O VI absorption toward Mrk 509 and PKS 2155-304 occurs at velocities similar\nto those of some of the C IV HVCs studied by Sembach et al. (1999). The Mrk 509 C IV HVCs\n(hVLSR i = \u2013287, \u2013228 km s\u22121 ) are believed to be located in the Local Group outside the Milky\nWay based upon their ionization properties and the very low thermal pressures (p/k \u223c 2 cm\u22123 K)\ninferred if the clouds are in photoionization equilibrium. They display strong C IV absorption, with\nlittle lower ionization absorption and no detectable H I 21 cm emission. Furthermore, they show\nno evidence of H\u03b1 emission (Sembach, Bland-Hawthorn, & Savage 2000). This ionization pattern\nis characteristic of gas clouds irradiated by extragalactic background radiation.\nThe O VI HVC absorption toward Mrk 509 is distributed in a broad component centered on\nhVLSR i \u2248 \u2212230 km s\u22121 , with FWHM \u2248 120 km s\u22121 . It exhibits a steep decline in strength at\nvelocities where the C IV is strongest (i.e., in the \u2013287 km s\u22121 component). Most of the O VI\nappears to be associated with the lower velocity C IV HVC at \u2013228 km s\u22121 . The ratio of C IV to\nO VI is <1 in this cloud and the HVCs observed toward PKS 2155-304. The observed amount of\nO VI is more than an order of magnitude higher than predicted by the standard photoionization\nmodel8 described by Sembach et al. (1999), which leads us to conclude that there are multiple\nionization processes in these HVCs.\n\n4.2.\n\nComplex C\n\nMrk 876 lies behind HVC Complex C, which is located more than 3.5 kpc from the Galactic\nplane (van Woerden et al. 1999). The low metallicity of Complex C, [S/H] \u223c \u22120.5 to \u22121.0, indicates\nthat it may be material falling onto the Milky Way rather than material ejected from the Galactic\ndisk (Wakker et al. 1999; Gibson et al. 2000). In the direction of Mrk 876, Complex C has two\ndistinct H I components centered on VLSR = \u2212175 and \u2212132 km s\u22121 (Murphy et al. 2000a). The\nbroad O VI absorption spans these neutral components and forms a smooth absorption trough (see\nFigure 2).\nThe presence of O VI at velocities similar to those of the neutral tracers of Complex C suggests\nthat Complex C contains a substantial amount of ionized gas. For a gas in collisonal ionization\nequilibrium at T = 3\u00d7105 K with Z \u223c 0.1\u20130.3 Z\u2299 , N(O VI) = 1.5\u00d71014 cm\u22122 translates into N(H+ )\n\u2248 (3 \u2212 9) \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 , or roughly 10\u201330% of the observed H I column density of 2.9 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 .\n8\n\nTheir photoionization model uses an AGN/QSO spectral energy distribution with a mean intensity at the Lyman\nlimit J0 = 1\u00d710\u221223 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 (Haardt & Madau 1996).\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.3.\n\nMagellanic Stream\n\nThree of the 7 sight lines exhibiting high velocity O VI lie in the general direction of the\nMagellanic Stream. Ton S210 and Ton S180 lie about 10\u25e6 off the Stream near Complex MSII.\nNo high velocity 21 cm emission from the Stream is detected toward either object; however 21 cm\nemission is detected toward Ton S210 at \u2212196 km s\u22121 with a width of 26 km s\u22121 (Murphy, Sembach,\n& Lockman 2000b). The H I and O VI HVCs toward Ton S210 are distinct from the nearby Stream\nmaterial, which has velocities VLSR & \u2013100 km s\u22121 in this direction. A sensitive H I map of\nthis region indicates that the 21 cm emission is isolated (M. Putman, private communication) and\nresembles the compact H I HVCs believed to be located in the Local Group (Braun & Burton 1999;\nbut see also Charlton et al. 2000 and Zwaan & Briggs 2000).\nIn the direction of NGC 7469, the high velocity O VI absorption is related to Magellanic Stream\nmaterial seen in H I 21 cm emission near \u2212350 km s\u22121 (Murphy et al. 2000b). Ionized Stream gas\nhas been detected previously through its H\u03b1 emission (Weiner & Williams 1996). Most of that\nemission could be explained by photoionization by starlight (Bland-Hawthorn & Maloney 1999).\nHowever, the presence of O VI in the Stream toward NGC 7469 indicates that hot gas must be\npresent since the low gas densities required to produce the observed amounts of O VI solely by\nphotoionization requires very large path lengths (l & 100 \u2212 200 kpc > dM S ).\n\n4.4.\n\nOuter Galaxy\n\nMost of the O VI absorption toward H 1821+643 can be attributed to the thick disk and outer\nGalactic warp (Oegerle et al. 2000; Savage et al. 2000). The broad, shallow absorption between\n\u2212300 and \u2212175 km s\u22121 is probably tracing gas in the most distant portions of the outer Galaxy.\nThe limiting velocity of co-rotating interstellar gas in this direction is roughly \u2013200 km s\u22121 . Savage,\nSembach, & Lu (1995) noted a very weak C IV feature with N(C IV) = (1.2\u00b10.3)\u00d71013 cm\u22122 near\n\u2013213 km s\u22121 . The velocity of the LSR with respect to the velocity centroid of the Local Group (l\n\u2248 105\u25e6 , b \u2248 \u20138\u25e6 ) is \u2248 \u2212300 km s\u22121 (see Mihalas & Binney 1982), so the projection of this relative\nvelocity onto the H 1821+643 sight line is \u2248 \u2013220 km s\u22121 , similar to that of the high velocity O VI.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nO VI is difficult to produce by photoionization (114 eV photons are required). The gas density\nmust be so low that path lengths exceeding the distance to the Magellanic Stream are necessary to\naccount for the observed quantities of O VI in the HVCs. See Sembach et al. (1999) for a discussion\nof the photoionization models.\nMany of the O VI HVCs contain cooler material (e.g., Mrk 876, NGC 7469), or are in close\nproximity to H I HVCs at similar velocities (e.g., Mrk 509, PKS 2155-304, Ton S210). To produce\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nO VI by shocks requires a shock speed of \u2248 170 km s\u22121 (Hartigan, Raymond, & Hartmann 1987).\nThe observed velocity gradients of the neutral gas in Complex C (van Woerden, Schwarz, & Hulsbosch 1985) and the Magellanic Stream (Mathewson & Ford 1984; Putman & Gibson 1999) are\nmuch smaller than this, so it seems unlikely that cloud-cloud collisions are responsible for the O VI.\nOne possibility for the production of the O VI observed in the HVCs is that the clouds are\nmoving through a pervasive, hot (T \u223c 106 K), low density (nH . 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22125 cm\u22123 ) Galactic halo\nor Local Group medium. The existence of such gas has been considered in various contexts (see\nFabian 1991; Weiner & Williams 1996; Blitz & Robishaw 2000; Murali 2000). The O VI HVCs\nhave velocities comparable to the adiabatic sound speed (\u223c 150 km s\u22121 ) for a hot, low density\nmedium. Thus, strong shocks are probably not responsible for the O VI production. Rather, in\nsuch a scenario, the O VI would occur in the conductive interfaces or turbulently mixed regions\nof ionized gas between the hot medium and the Magellanic Stream or other cooler gas detected in\n21 cm emission or ultraviolet absorption.\nAlternatively, some of the O VI may be produced within cooling regions of hot gas structures\nassociated with the assembly of the Milky Way. Much of the baryonic content of the low redshift\nuniverse is expected to be at temperatures of 105 \u2212 107 K in the vicinity of galaxies and groups of\ngalaxies (Cen & Ostriker 1999). As the hot gas flows onto galaxies, portions of it should cool as\nthe density increases. Complex C may represent a relatively advanced stage of such an accretion,\nwhile the HVCs toward Mrk 509 and PKS 2155-304 would represent an earlier evolutionary stage.\nFUSE data for a large number of AGN/QSO sight lines should help to distinguish between these\nvarious possibilities for the production of the O VI HVCs.\nThis work is based on data obtained for the Guaranteed Time Team by the NASA-CNES-CSA\nFUSE mission operated by the Johns Hopkins University.
