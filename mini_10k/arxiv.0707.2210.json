We also\nstudy the effect of varying the coupling constant of the atom-atom interaction on the scattering\nlength.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nExperimentally, 4 He dimers have been observed in 1993 by Luo at al. [1], and in 1994 by\nSch\u00f6llkopf and Toennies [2]. In the latter investigation the existence of 4 He trimers has also\nbeen demonstrated. Later on, Grisenti et al. [3] measured a bond length of 52 \u00b1 4 \u00c5 for 4 He2 ,\nwhich indicates that this dimer is the largest known diatomic molecular ground state. Based on\n+0.3\nthis measurement they estimated a scattering length of 104+8\n\u221218 \u00c5 and a dimer energy of 1.1\u22120.2\nmK [3]. Further investigations concerning 4 He trimers and tetramers have been reported in [4],\nbut with no results on size and binding energies. To the best of our knowledge, we are not\naware of any experimental results on binding energy and size of the asymmetric helium trimer\nconsisting of two 4 He and one 3 He atoms.\nMany theoretical calculations of the helium three-atomic systems were performed in the past\nfor various interatomic potentials. Variational, hyperspherical, and Faddeev-type techniques\nhave been employed in this context [5]\u2013[17]. It was found that the 4 He trimer has two bound\nstates of total angular momentum zero: a ground state of about 126 mK and an excited state\nof about 2.28 mK. Experimentally this Efimov-type excited state has not yet been observed. It\nshould be mentioned, however, that the year 2006 is noticeable due the first convincing experimental evidence for the Efimov effect in an ultracold gas of caesium atoms [18].\nDue to the smaller mass of the 3 He atom, the 3 He\u20134 He system is unbound. Nevertheless,\nthe 3 He4 He2 trimer exists, though with a binding energy of about 14 mK. In contrast to the\nsymmetric case, there is no excited state in the asymmetric 3 He4 He2 system.\nPhase shifts of 4 He\u20134 He2 elastic scattering at ultra-low energies have been calculated for the\nfirst time in [10, 11] both below and above the three-body threshold. An alternative ab initio\ncalculation was performed in [13], but only below the threshold. The only available results on\nthe 3 He\u20134 He2 phase shifts were obtained in [16]. For completeness we notice that zero-range\nmodels are able to reproduce the 4 He\u20134 He2 scattering situation [19].\n\u2217\n\nPublished in Nucl. Phys. A 790 (2007), 752c\u2013756c.\nwork was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the Heisenberg-Landau Program,\nAlexander von Humboldt Foundation, and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.\n\n\u2020 This\n\n\f2\nIn what follows we present our results on binding energies and scattering observables in the\nhelium three-atomic systems obtained mainly with the LM2M2 potential by Aziz and Slaman\n[20].\n2. RESULTS\nIn our calculations we employed the hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations\ndeveloped in [21]. Table 1 summarizes trimer binding energies and He\u2013He2 scattering lengths,\ncalculated with the LM2M2 potential. The binding energies of the 4 He trimer ground state\n(E4 He3 ) and exited state (E4\u2217He ) are presented in the first two rows. These results demonstrate\n3\nthe good agreement between the different methods.\nTable 1\nResults for binding energies of the 4 He3 and 3 He4 He2 trimers and the He\u2013He2 scattering\nlengths.\n\u2212E4 He3 (mK)\n\n[11]a\n125.9\n\n[6]\n125.2\n\n[7]\n125.5\n\n[8]\n126.41\n\n\u2212E4\u2217He (mK)\n\n2.276b\n\n2.269\n\n2.19\n\n2.271\n\n(4 He\u22124 He2 )\n\n115.5c\n\n126.\n\n115.4d\n\n3\n\nlsc\n\n(\u00c5)\n\n\u2212E3 He4 He2 (mK)\n(3 He\u22124 He2 )\n\nlsc\n\n(\u00c5)\n\n13.84e\n21.0e\n\n13.66\n\n14.4f\n\n[9]\n126.39\n\n[12]\n[15]\n126.4 126.39\n2.265\n\n2.268\n115.2\n\n14.165\n\n19.3f\n\na Calculations with\n\nmaximal value lmax = 4 of the subsystem angular momentum. b This value was rounded in [11].\nc Result of extrapolation, see [14]. d Result from Ref.

[14] our\nprevious calculations of [11] have been improved essentially by enlarging the grid parameters\nand the cut-off hyperradius. This table also contains the results by Blume and Greene [7], by\nRoudnev [13], and the most recent ones by Lazauskas and Carbonell [15]. The treatment of\n[7] is based on a combination of the Monte Carlo method and the hyperspherical adiabatic\napproach. Roudnev employs three-dimensional Faddeev differential equations. Lazauskas and\nCarbonell also use differential Faddeev equations, but with the hard-core boundary conditions\nof Ref. [21]. Our results agree rather well with these alternative calculations. For completeness\nwe mention the model calculations of [19]. Being characterized by remarkable simplicity, they\nrely essentially on the binding energy obtained in ab initio calculations.\nThe last two rows of Table 1 contain results for the binding energy of the asymmetric 3 He4 He2\ntrimer and for the 3 He\u20134 He2 scattering length. The phase shifts \u03b4 (E) of 3 He\u20134 He2 and 4 He\u2013\n4 He scattering are depicted in Fig. 1 where in both cases the normalization \u03b4 (0) = 0 is used.\n2\nIt is already widely accepted that the excited 4 He trimer state is of Efimov nature. For the first\ntime this was clearly shown by Cornelius and Gl\u00f6ckle [5]. A more detailed investigation has\nbeen made in [23] where the mechanism of emerging new Efimov states from resonances was\nstudied. For a latest discussion of this subject see Ref. [15]. Table 2, which is borrowed partly\nfrom [23], demonstrates how a new Efimov level arises from a virtual state when the interatomic\n\n\f3\nTable 2\nDependence of the 4 He dimer and trimer energies (mK) and the 4 He\u20134 He and 4 He\u20134 He2 scattering lengths (\u00c5) on the potential strength \u03bb .

To this end we multiply the original HFD-B potential\nof Ref. [22] by a factor \u03bb < 1. Decreasing this coupling constant, there emerges, for \u03bb \u2248 0.986,\na virtual state with energy Evirt lying on the unphysical sheet. This energy, relative to the diatom\nenergy \u03b5d , is given in the lower half of column 4. When decreasing \u03bb further, this state turns at\nthe value \u03bb \u2248 0.976 into the second excited state. Its energy E \u2217\u2217 relative to \u03b5d is shown at the\nbottom of the fifth column. When the second excited state emerges, the atom\u2013diatom scattering\n(1+2)\n(1+1)\nlength lsc\nchanges its sign going through a pole, while the atom-atom scattering length lsc\nincreases monotonically.\nWe have also studied the opposite case where \u03bb > 1 is increasing. In this case the scattering\n(1+2)\n(1+2)\nbecomes negative passing through a\nlength lsc\nis growing until \u03bb \u2248 1.175. There lsc\n\u2217\nsingularity and the excited state energy E turns into a virtual level. The energy Evirt of this\nstate is shown for \u03bb \u2265 1.18 in the upper quarter of column 4.\nIn Fig. 2 we graphically display the behavior of the atom-atom and atom-diatom scattering\n(1+1)\n(1+2)\nlengths lsc\nand lsc\nshown in Table 2.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nF.
