As\nthe most accurate experimental data available are for the 3p \u2192 1s transition\nenergy, we will consider only this case in the present paper. The most recent\nfully published experimental values of these quantities are given in Ref. [2]. A\nsuccessor experiment [3] is nearing completion, and preliminary results from\nthis experiment for the transition energy [4] and for the width [5] are available.\nIn Section 2 of this paper we shall give a detailed derivation of the relevant\nconversion equations which connect the experimental data with the scattering parameters, paying particular attention to the sources of uncertainty and\nmaking clear which pion-nucleon (\u03c0N) interactions contribute to the parameters. We use these conversion equations to obtain the values of acc and ac0\nfrom the results in Refs. [4,5]. These equations can also be used for the final\nresults of the experiment [3] and for those of any future experiment.\nThe conversion equations just mentioned are based on the formalism of Ref. [6].\nIt was the first work to generalise the systematic derivation of the DGBT formulae for a one-channel system [7,8] to a multichannel system, and to apply\nthe results to pionic H. This systematic derivation is based on the general\nprinciples of scattering theory and on the analytic continuation of the matrix\nK (defined later in Eq. (3)) into the complex s-plane, to those (complex) values of s which correspond to the levels of pionic H. All this is independent of\nany phenomenological model of the dynamics of the system. The formalism\nof Ref. [6] enables one to extract directly and unambiguously from the experimental data the values of precisely defined threshold scattering parameters\nacc and ac0 , whose errors are dominated by the experimental errors of these\natomic data. Then, as a second quite distinct step, a dynamical calculation of\nthe electromagnetic (EM) corrections to these quantities is needed if we are\nto obtain hadronic scattering parameters.\nIn Section 3 we shall describe our calculation of the electromagnetic (EM)\ncorrections to the threshold parameters, which uses a three-channel potential\nmodel to remove the effects of the Coulomb interaction, the external mass\ndifferences and the presence of the \u03b3n channel. We shall also give the values,\ntogether with estimated errors, of the corrected scattering parameters (denoted by \u00e3cc and \u00e3c0 ) which result from acc and ac0 . In Section 4 we shall\nset our calculation of the EM corrections in the context of previously published calculations, and attempt to summarise our present understanding of\nthese corrections. We shall see that, while the experimental data from pionic\nH yield extremely accurate values of acc and ac0 , the calculation of the EM\n2\n\n\fcorrections needed to obtain hadronic quantities is subject to a great deal of\nuncertainty.\nIn Section 5 we shall use the value of the s-wave scattering length \u00e3+ for\n\u03c0 + p elastic scattering, obtained from a recent phase-shift analysis (PSA) [9]\nof the data up to a laboratory pion kinetic energy (T\u03c0 ) of 100 MeV, which\nemployed the EM corrections of Ref. [10], also calculated using a potential\nmodel. To ensure that the two calculations of EM corrections were consistent,\nwe adopted, for the hadronic potentials in the calculation described in Section\n3, the same forms as were used for the corrections given in Ref. [10]. We shall\nshow that this \u221a\nvalue of \u00e3+ shows a large and significant difference from the\nvalue of \u00e3cc + 2\u00e3c0 , calculated from the most recent values of \u00e3cc and \u00e3c0\ngiven in Section 3.\nThis reinforces the evidence for the violation of isospin invariance given in\nRef. [9], from the inability of the phase shifts, obtained from the analysis of \u03c0 \u00b1 p\nelastic scattering data alone, to reproduce the data on \u03c0 \u2212 p charge exchange\nscattering. As discussed in Ref. [9], at least part of this violation of isospin\ninvariance has to be attributed to the presence of residual EM effects in the\nphase shifts obtained from the experimental data after the application of our\ncorrections. This is because the EM corrections calculated using a potential\nmodel are only partial (stage 1) corrections; further (stage 2) corrections are\nneeded to remove these residual EM effects.\nWe do not include in the present paper the information from the accurate\nmeasurement of a transition energy in pionic deuterium (D) [11]. There is an\nextensive literature on this subject [12,13,14]. The most recent of these papers\n[14] concludes tentatively that, when stage 2 corrections (calculated using chiral perturbation theory at leading order) are taken into account, the atomic\ndata from pionic H and pionic D taken by themselves satisfy isospin invariance\nat the hadronic level. However, Ref. [14] emphasises that an improved measurement of a transition energy in pionic D is needed, as is a major effort on\nthe theoretical side, to extract a scattering parameter with better precision.\nThis complex subject lies outside the scope of this paper. Our aim here is to\npresent what can be learned directly from the experimental data for pionic H\nand to relate the results consistently to those obtained from our PSA [9].\n\n2\n\nConversion formulae\n\nThe first piece of experimental data from pionic H is the 3p \u2192 1s transition\nenergy W (3p \u2192 1s). The positions of the 3p and 1s levels relative to the \u03c0 \u2212 p\nthreshold we call W (3p) and W (1s) respectively. For the numerical calculations we will use always the most recent values of the physical constants [15];\n3\n\n\ferrors will be given only if they are relevant for our purpose.\nNonrelativistically the point charge Coulomb potential V pc contributes\n\u2212359.438 eV to W (3p). The shift due to vacuum polarisation is \u22120.011 eV\n[16]. Furthermore the 3p level is split by the hyperfine interaction and the\nrelativistic effects. The former is discussed on page 413 of Ref. [6], while the\nlatter is given by Eqs. (9,10) of Ref. [17]. For j = 3/2 these two effects add\nto \u22120.0013 eV, for j = 1/2 to \u22120.0055 eV. With the present experimental\nresolution of W (3p \u2192 1s) this splitting cannot be seen. We therefore take\na weighted average of \u22120.003 eV, with an uncertainty of 0.002 eV, as the\ncontribution of these effects to W (3p). The shift in the 3p level due to the\nhadronic interaction, including the effect of the extended charge distributions\nof \u03c0 \u2212 and p, is negligible. Thus\nW (3p) = \u2212359.452(2) eV .\nSince in the transition 3p \u2192 1s the kinetic recoil energy of the \u03c0 \u2212 atom in the\nc.m. frame is 0.004 eV, we have\nW (1s) = \u2212W (3p \u2192 1s) \u2212 359.456(2) eV .\n\n(1)\n\nNonrelativistically V pc contributes \u22123234.945 eV to W (1s). The relativistic\nshift for an infinitely heavy proton is \u22120.215 eV. This comes either from\nRef. [17] or from integration of the Klein-Gordon equation [16]. In addition,\nboth these references give a relativistic recoil shift of +0.037 eV and a contribution of +0.010 eV due to the magnetic moment of the proton. Ref. [16]\nalso quotes a contribution of \u22120.018 eV for vacuum polarisation at O(\u03b13 )\nand a vertex correction of +0.007 eV. The potential V vp for vacuum polarisation at O(\u03b12 ) is the Uehling potential, modified at short distances due to the\nfinite extension of the charge distributions of \u03c0 \u2212 and p. Adding V vp to V pc ,\nour calculations give a shift of \u22123.244 eV. The finite extension of the charge\ndistributions also modifies V pc itself through the addition of a potential\nV ext = \u2212\u03b1/r(erf (r/c) \u2212 1),\n\nwith\n\n2\nc2 = (< r 2 >\u03c0 + < r 2 >p ) .\n3\n\nThe rms charge radii of \u03c0 \u2212 and p were taken from Refs. [18,19]. The addition\nof V ext to V pc gives a further shift of +0.100 eV. The 1s position arising\nfrom the purely electromagnetic contributions considered so far is \u22123238.268\neV. Nearly all the difference between this value and the widely used \"total\nelectromagnetic binding energy\" in Table 1 of Ref. [16] comes from the change\nin the value of \u2212 21 \u03b12 mc , due to the use of the most recent value [15] of the\nmass \u03bcc of the \u03c0 \u2212 .\n4\n\n\fThere are sizeable contributions to W (1s) from the interference of V vp and\nV ext with the hadronic interaction Ve (see Section 4; Ve as well as the other\npotentials are matrices in a coupled-channel calculation). We determined this\nshift, as well as the width, directly in a subthreshold calculation with mass\ndifferences included. To this end we evaluated the shift and the width due\nto Ve , for the two cases V pc + V vp + V ext + Ve and V pc + Ve . It turned out\nthat, when the direct contributions of V vp and V ext (\u22123.244 eV and +0.100 eV\nrespectively) are accounted for, the shift due to the interference of (V vp +V ext )\nwith Ve is numerically negligible. The error, estimated by varying the range\nof Ve , is 0.003 eV. The cancellation of the two interference contributions due\nto V vp and V ext was already noted implicitly in Ref. [16]. The result for the\nwidth will be given later.\nThe shift of the purely electromagnetic 1s position given above, due to the\ninterference of Ve with V pc only, we call \u2206W . Thus, from the result in the\npreceding paragraph, we have\nW (1s) = \u22123238.268(8) eV + \u2206W ,\nand, using Eq. (1),\n\u2206W = \u2212W (3p \u2192 1s) + 2878.812(8) eV .\n\n(2)\n\nNote that, for practical purposes, the shift \u2206W defined in this way is equal\nto the quantity \u01eb1s defined in Refs. [2,4,16]. This is because, though we have\ntaken account of the short-range effects fully, by including the interference of\nV pc with (V vp + V ext ) in the calculation of the shift and width (rather than as\na correction to the scattering parameters), the effect is negligible in the case\nof the shift. In the last two equations we have given the uncertainty explicitly.\nIt is dominated by the uncertainty in \u03bcc .\nThe hadronic interaction couples the \u03c0 \u2212 p channel to the \u03c0 0 n and \u03b3n channels.\nAs well as creating the shift \u2206W , it also makes the 1s level unstable, with\na width \u0393. Compared to \u0393, the hadronic and electromagnetic widths of the\n3p level can be neglected numerically. The process then is a three-body decay\nof the well defined 3p level, going via the unstable 1s level: 3p \u2192 (\u03c0 0 n)\u03b3 or\n(\u03b3n)\u03b3. The parentheses indicate that (\u03c0 0 n) and (\u03b3n) are the decay products\nof the intermediate 1s level.\nThe treatment of such a three-body decay mechanism is given in detail in\nSection 4 of Ref. [20]. Let s be the square of the invariant mass of (\u03c0 0 n) (or\n(\u03b3n)). It turns out that the decay amplitude is proportional to\n(s \u2212 M02 + iM0 \u0393)\u22121 .\n5\n\n\fHere M0 = \u03bcc + mp + W (1s), mp being the proton mass. We have neglected\na possible dependence of \u0393 on s. Using the relation between s and the energy\nE of the photon in the rest frame of the decaying 3p state, and noting that\nW (3p \u2192 1s) << M0 , one sees that the spectrum of E becomes proportional\nto\n1\n[(E \u2212 W (3p \u2192 1s))2 + \u03932 ]\u22121 .\n4\nThus the measurement of this spectrum gives W (3p \u2192 1s) and \u0393.\nWe now derive the conversion equations which give the values of the elements\nacc and ac0 of a, the s-wave scattering matrix for the (\u03c0 \u2212 p,\u03c0 0 n,\u03b3n) system at\nthe \u03c0 \u2212 p threshold, in terms of W (3p \u2192 1s) and \u0393. We use c, 0 and \u03b3 to denote\nthe three coupled channels and qc , q0 and k to denote the channel momenta\nin the c.m. frame. The matrix a is the value of K at the \u03c0 \u2212 p threshold qc = 0.\nK is defined in terms of the unitary matrix S by\nt = \u2212i(S \u2212 13 )(S + 13 )\u22121 ,\n\n\uf8eb\n\nK\u22121 =\n\n\uf8ec C0 (\u03b7)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec C0 (\u03b7)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 1/2 \u22121 1/2 \uf8ec\nQ t Q \uf8ec 0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n0 0\uf8f7\n\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n01\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec \u2212\u03b2h(\u03b7)\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n+\uf8ec\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\n0 0\uf8f7\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n01\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n.

[6] will now be used to obtain the conversion formulae.\nStrictly speaking, the formalism relates \u2206W and \u0393 to Kcc and Kc0 , evaluated\nat the position of the 1s level. For reasons discussed in Section 3, phase shift\nanalysis of low energy \u03c0 \u2212 p elastic scattering does not give any reliable knowledge of the range parameters for Kcc and Kc0 . However, it is sufficient to note\n6\n\n\fthat the differences between the values of Kcc and Kc0 at the \u03c0 \u2212 p threshold\nand at the position of the 1s level are expected to be of order 1 * 10\u22126 fm,\nwell below the uncertainties due to the experimental error. We therefore work\nfrom now on with the matrix a defined above. Following Ref. [6] we introduce\nthe matrix A by\n\uf8eb\n\nA\u22121 = a\u22121\n\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u2212 i\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n,\nq0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 0 k\n\n(5)\n\nwhere q0 and k are from now on the c.m. channel momenta at the \u03c0 \u2212 p\nthreshold qc = 0. Numerically we will use q0 = 28.0408(96) MeV/c and\nk = 129.40705(31) MeV/c.\nFrom Eq. (5) we have\nacc = RAcc + q02 a2c0 a00 + 2q0 kac0 ac\u03b3 a0\u03b3 + k 2 a2c\u03b3 a\u03b3\u03b3 ,\n\n(6)\n\n1 1\n3\n1\n1\nac0 = \u2212|Ac0 |(1 + q0 ka20\u03b3 + q02 a200 \u2212 P \u2212 2 q02 k 2 a0\u03b3 a\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 P \u22121 q0 ka20\u03b3 ) . (7)\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nEquation (6) is straightforward; Equation (7) uses the result ac\u03b3 = \u2212ac0 q02 k \u2212 2 P \u2212 2 ,\nwhere P is the Panofsky ratio, whose value [21] is 1.546(9). Equations (6,7)\ngive only the lowest terms in an expansion. To assess the magnitude of these\nterms we need estimates for ac0 , ac\u03b3 , a00 , a0\u03b3 , a\u03b3\u03b3 . The values of these quantities will be discussed in Section 3. Numerically, we find that\nacc = RAcc (1 + 4.9 * 10\u22125 ) , ac0 = \u2212|Ac0 |(1 + 1.1 * 10\u22126 ) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe correction terms in Eq. (8) are negligible.\nThe expression for \u2206W is given in Eq. (12) of Ref. [6] with n = 1, l = 0.\nKeeping only the numerically significant terms we have\n\u2206W\nI\u01eb0 2\n) ] + p2 (R\u01eb0 )2 ) ,\n= R\u01eb0 (1 + p1 R\u01eb0 [1 \u2212 (\npc\nW (1s)\nR\u01eb0\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n1\nW (1s)pc = \u2212 \u03b12 mc , R\u01eb0 = 4acc /B , I\u01eb0 = 4q0 (1 + P \u22121 )|ac0|2 /B , (10)\n2\n7\n\n\fB = 1/\u03b1mc being the lowest Bohr radius of the \u03c0 \u2212 p atom. The numerical\nvalues are mc = 121.49719(26) MeV, W (1s)pc = \u22123234.945(7) eV and B =\n222.56399(48) fm. The quantity p1 = 1/2(1 + \u03b3) = 0.78860783, \u03b3 being Euler's\nconstant. The expression for p2 is given in Ref. [6]. The term involving a\npoorly known effective range parameter is small, and the result p2 = \u22120.22 is\nsufficiently accurate for our purpose.\nFrom the experiment [3], Ref. [4] gives W (3p \u2192 1s) = 2885.928(10) eV. Using\nEq. (2), this results in \u2206W = \u22127.116(13) eV. With this number as the starting\npoint for the iteration of Eq. (9), we obtain\nacc (fm) = 0.0171704(1)(\u2212\u2206W (eV)) .\n\n(11)\n\nThe error in the constant in Eq. (11) comes from the uncertainty in mc (due almost entirely to the error in \u03bcc ) and the uncertainty in \u2206W (via the iteration).\nHowever, it is so small that it is of no consequence and will be disregarded in\nwhat follows. Using Eq. (2), the first conversion formula is\nacc (fm) = (0.0171704)[W (3p \u2192 1s)(eV) \u2212 2878.812(8)] .\n\n(12)\n\nNumerically we obtain\nacc = 0.12218(22) fm .\n\n(13)\n\nWe would like to stress that the present experimental results for W (3p \u2192 1s)\nand for \u0393 [4,5] are consistent with, but more precise than, the earlier ones\ngiven in Ref. [2]. The result in Eq. (13) is by far the most accurate number in\nlow energy \u03c0N physics, and further refinement will not be useful, in view of\nthe uncertainty in \u03bcc and even more of the uncertainty in the EM corrections\nto be discussed later.\nWe come now to the measured total width \u0393 for the decay of the atomic 1s\nstate into both the \u03c0 0 n and \u03b3n channels. The numerical result for the Panofsky\nratio P quoted earlier is used first to obtain the partial width \u03930 for decay\ninto \u03c0 0 n:\n\u0393 = (1 + P \u22121 )\u03930 .\n\n(14)\n\nVacuum polarisation and the finite extension of the charges each have a small\nbut significant effect on \u03930 . The subthreshold calculation discussed earlier in\nconnection with the shift shows that V ext changes \u03930 by the factor 0.9948,\nwhile V vp changes it by the factor 1.0049. The total effect of (V vp + V ext ) is\na change by the factor 0.9996.\n8\n\n\fThe treatment of decay widths on pages 410 and 411 of Ref. [6] gives\n\u03930 = 4\u03b13 m2c q0 a2c0 (1 + 2p1 R\u01eb0 + p21 |\u01eb0 |2 + 2p2 (R\u01eb0 )2 ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nkeeping only terms which are significant numerically and replacing |Ac0 |2 by\na2c0 (see Eq. (8)). Combining Eqs. (14,15) and using numerical values already\ngiven leads to the second conversion formula\nac0 (fm) = \u22120.19042(22)(\u0393(eV)) 1/2 .\n\n(16)\n\nAlmost all the error in Eq. (16) arises from the uncertainty in P . An updated\nresult for \u0393 from the experiment [3] is 0.823(19) eV [5]. This leads via Eq. (16)\nto\nac0 = \u22120.1727(20) fm .\n\n(17)\n\nAll the error in Eq. (17) comes from the experimental uncertainty on \u0393; the\nerror due to the uncertainty of the conversion constant is negligible. The experiment [3] finally hopes to achieve an accuracy of 1% (an absolute uncertainty\nof 0.008 eV), which will reduce the error on ac0 to about 0.0009 fm. Even in\nthis case the error due to the conversion constant is only 2 * 10\u22125 fm; therefore,\na more accurate measurement of the Panofsky ratio would not improve the\naccuracy of the final value of ac0 .\n\n3\n\nCalculation of electromagnetic corrections\n\nTo calculate the electromagnetic corrections to acc and ac0 due to the pointcharge Coulomb interaction, the external mass differences and the presence\nof the \u03b3n channel, we set up a potential model for the physical three-channel\nsituation at the \u03c0 \u2212 p threshold. The relativised Schr\u00f6dinger equation (RSE)\nfor the s-wave has the form\nf + Vpc)]u(r) = 0 ,\n[d2 /dr 213 + Q2 \u2212 2m\u0303(V\n\nwhere, since we are working at the \u03c0 \u2212 p threshold qc = 0,\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8ec0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\nQ = \uf8ec 0 q0 0 \uf8f7 ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0 0 k\n9\n\n(18)\n\n\fwith q0 and k having the same meaning as in Eq.

[22], for the two-channel potential model calculation of the EM corrections\nfor the analysis of low energy \u03c0 \u2212 p scattering data. The modification is essential\nfor the \u03b3n channel, where the standard reduced mass is zero, whereas m\u0303\u03b3 in\nEq. (20) is in fact just k.\nThe 3 \u00d7 3 matrix Vpc in Eq.

We recall that\nthe effects of vacuum polarisation and of the finite extension of the charges of\nf in the form\n\u03c0 \u2212 and p have already been accounted for.

There is clear evidence, to be\nf violates isospin invariance, though only by a\ndiscussed in Section 5, that V\nh\nfew percent. However, we have only the numbers acc and ac0 available experf in terms of\nimentally (a00 is inaccessible) and therefore need to express V\nh\nf as isospin\ntwo parameters. Hence we made the approximation of treating V\nh\ninvariant:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\nf =\uf8ed\nV\nh\n\n2e\nV + 31 Ve3/2\n3 1/2\n\u221a\n2 e\n(V3/2 \u2212 Ve1/2 )\n3\n\n\u221a\n\n2 e\n(V3/2\n3\n\n1 e\nV\n3 1/2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2212 Ve1/2 ) \uf8f7\n\n+ 32 Ve3/2\n\n\uf8f8.\n\nWe made the same approximation in Ref. [22] in order to calculate EM corrections for the analysis of low energy \u03c0 \u2212 p scattering data. Since this potential\nis used solely for the calculation of the corrections, this approximation should\nhave very little effect on the results. For Ve1/2 and Ve3/2 we assumed the radial\ndependence of the s-wave hadronic potentials used in Refs. [10,22] and left\ntheir strengths as parameters to be adjusted. The leading term in each potential is of gaussian form, with a range parameter which is fixed at 1 fm (a\nrealistic value for the hadronic interaction), and two small correction terms\nare added.\nThe three potentials Vc\u03b3 , V0\u03b3 and V\u03b3\u03b3 in Eq. (21) also need to have some assumed radial dependence, with their strengths left as parameters to be adjusted. A study of the analytic structure of the relevant amplitudes shows\nthat the range parameter 1 fm is also appropriate for these three potentials.\nFor convenience we took the radial dependence of Vc\u03b3 to be the same as that\nof Vec0 , and the radial dependence of V0\u03b3 and V\u03b3\u03b3 to be the same as that of\nVe00 . In the calculation there were then five potential strengths to be adjusted,\nwith five experimentally determined numbers used to fix them.\nIn addition to the values of acc and ac0 given in Eqs. (13,17), we used experimentally determined values of ac\u03b3 , a0\u03b3 and a\u03b3\u03b3 . From the values of ac0 and P ,\nwe obtain ac\u03b3 = 0.0647 fm. The value of a0\u03b3 can be obtained only from an\nanalysis of experimental data near threshold for the photoproduction process\n\u03b3n \u2192 \u03c0 0 n. The results given in Ref. [23] lead to a0\u03b3 = \u22120.0028 fm, but no\nerror is given; we think that 0.0006 fm is a realistic uncertainty. The value of\na\u03b3\u03b3 comes from the analysis of data on Compton scattering off neutrons. From\nresults in Ref. [24] we have extracted a\u03b3\u03b3 = 0.0011 fm, with an uncertainty\nof around 20%. The five potential strengths were then varied until they ref for the three-channel\nproduced the five numbers just discussed, thus fixing V\ncalculation.\nWe now give some details of the calculation of a from the RSE (18). For\nthe two-channel case (omitting the \u03b3n channel) the calculation is given fully\n11\n\n\fin Section 3 of Ref. [25]; it can easily be generalised to the three-channel\nsituation. The first step is to form the matrix P(r) by putting side by side,\nas its three columns, three linearly independent regular solutions uj (r), j =\nf is negligible. We then\n1, 2, 3, of Eq. (18).

This choice is made in\n12\n\n\fmost studies of the low energy \u03c0N system and was discussed fully in Section\n5.2 of Ref. [9]. Thus the scattering parameters \u00e3cc and \u00e3c0 which result from\nEq. (24) still contain residual EM contributions.\nBy integrating Eq. (24) we obtain the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u00e3; the numerical values for\nthe relevant matrix elements are\n\u00e3cc = 0.12140 fm , \u00e3c0 = \u22120.1757 fm .\n\n(25)\n\nWe now define the stage 1 EM corrections\n\u22061 acc = acc \u2212 \u00e3cc , \u22061 ac0 = ac0 \u2212 \u00e3c0 .\n\n(26)\n\nFrom Eqs. (13), (17), (25) and (26), we have\n\u22061 acc = +0.00078 fm , \u22061 ac0 = +0.0030 fm .\n\n(27)\n\nThese are the essential results from the present calculation.\nIt is instructive to look at the contributions of the three effects to the corrections \u22061 acc and \u22061 ac0 . For \u22061 acc we have\n\u2206acc (pc) = \u22120.00214 fm , \u2206acc (md) = \u22120.00071 fm , \u2206acc (\u03b3n) = +0.00363 fm.(28)\nThe smallness of the total correction is thus seen to be the result of a near\ncancellation between the effect of the \u03b3n channel, which is large, and the\ncombined effect of V pc and the mass differences. One sees how important it is\nto estimate the effect of the \u03b3n channel as reliably as possible. For \u22061 ac0 the\nsituation is quite different. We now have\n\u2206ac0 (pc) = \u22120.0002 fm , \u2206ac0 (md) = +0.0029 fm , \u2206ac0 (\u03b3n) = +0.0003 fm.(29)\nThe effect of the \u03b3n channel is now very small, and the correction is due almost\nentirely to the mass differences.\nUncertainties in the corrections given in Eq. (27) arise from: (a) the shapes\nf ; (b) the errors of the five experimentally deassumed for the components of V\nh\ntermined quantities which are fitted; (c) the approximation of using an isospin\nf . The quantity \u2206a (pc) has a significant uncertainty due\ninvariant form for V\nh\ncc\nf . This was estito lack of knowledge of the shapes of the components of V\nh\nmated as in Refs. [10,22] by varying the range parameter between 0.8 fm and\n1.2 fm and simultaneously adjusting the strengths of the potentials so that\nthe five scattering parameters discussed earlier in this section remain constant.\n13\n\n\fThe quantity \u2206acc (\u03b3n) suffers from the same uncertainty, and has in addition\na significant error due to the uncertainty in ac\u03b3 , a0\u03b3 and a\u03b3\u03b3 . The uncertainty\nf (the\nin \u2206ac0 (md), the dominant part of \u22061 ac0 , comes from uncertainties in V\nh\ne\ne\nshapes of V1/2 and V3/2 and the assumption of isospin invariance).\nUnfortunately, in the situation under consideration one cannot achieve the\nprecision associated with the errors quoted in the experimental results. The\nvariations described in the previous paragraph can lead to rather rough estimates only. It is therefore wise to err on the side of caution and increase these\nestimates accordingly. We think that, on the basis of the estimates we have\nmade, the errors on each of the components of the corrections could be as high\nas 20%. This leads to the following final values for the corrections\n\u22061 acc = +0.0008(8) fm , \u22061 ac0 = +0.0030(6) fm .\n\n(30)\n\nCombining Eqs. (13), (17) and (30), we obtain the final results\n\u00e3cc = 0.1214(8) fm , \u00e3c0 = \u22120.1757(21) fm .\n\n(31)\n\n(We have given results for the s-wave scattering parameters in fm because it\nis a precisely defined unit. In units which are in common use, the final results\n\u22121\nin Eq. (31) are \u00e3cc = 0.0859(6)\u03bc\u22121\nc and \u00e3c0 = \u22120.1243(15)\u03bcc .)\nIt is important to note that the error in \u00e3cc arises almost entirely from the\nuncertainty in \u22061 acc , so that an improvement in the accuracy of the measurement of W (3p \u2192 1s) will not reduce the error in \u00e3cc . On the other hand,\nalmost all the error in \u00e3c0 comes from the experimental uncertainty in \u0393. If\nthe error in the measurement of \u0393 can be reduced to 1%, the uncertainty in\n\u00e3c0 in Eq. (31) will be reduced from (21) to (11).\nIn the discussion following Eq. (35) of Ref. [9], we emphasised the very large\ndifference between the values of \u00e3cc which come from pionic H and from our\nPSA of the combined \u03c0 + p and \u03c0 \u2212 p elastic scattering databases for T\u03c0 \u2264\n100 MeV. Converting from the unit \u03bc\u22121\nto fm, the latter gives the value\nc\n\u00e3cc = 0.1127(16) fm. The difference between this value and the value 0.1214(8)\nfm given in Eq. (31) is thus 0.0087(18) fm. This large difference is a subtle\nconsequence of the violation of isospin invariance in the electromagnetically\nmodified hadronic interaction, which is convincingly demonstrated in Section 7\nof Ref. [9] and in Section 5 of this paper. The phase shift \u03b4\u03031/2 used in Ref. [9] to\nanalyse \u03c0 \u2212 p elastic scattering data is an artificial construct, which enables the\nanalysis to be done in a framework of formal isospin invariance. When isospin\ninvariance is violated, \u03b4\u03031/2 goes to a nonzero value at threshold, so that the\nscattering length \u00e31/2 given in Ref. [9] is an artefact of the parameterisation of\n\u03b4\u03031/2 , which forces it to behave like qc near threshold, and the extrapolation to\n14\n\n\fthreshold (using this artificial parameterisation) of values of \u03b4\u03031/2 obtained from\ndata at momenta qc \u2248 80 MeV/c upwards. Therefore the value of \u00e3cc extracted\nfrom pionic H cannot be compared directly with the value of (2\u00e31/2 + \u00e3+ )/3\nobtained in the PSA of Ref. [9].\n\n4\n\nComparison with other calculations of the electromagnetic corrections\n\nAs mentioned already in the introduction, in our method of calculating the\nEM corrections to the pionic H data we use hadronic potentials which are of\nthe same form as those of Refs. [10,22]. This implies that the EM corrections\nwhich were applied to the low energy \u03c0 \u00b1 p scattering data in our PSA of Ref. [9]\nare compatible with the ones obtained in the present paper for the pionic H\ncase. For the PSA, it was sufficient, in analysing data from qc \u2248 80 MeV/c\nupwards, to take the \u03b3n channel into account by using the perturbative result\nof Ref. [26]. It has practically no effect on the results of the PSA. However, for\nour calculation at threshold, the effect of the \u03b3n channel turns out to be very\nsignificant in the case of the correction to acc , thus justifying the full threechannel calculation we have made. In these respects, our calculations of the\nEM corrections to the pionic H data differ considerably from the older work\nof Refs. [16,27], both of which use primitive forms of the hadronic potentials\nwhich reproduce only the scattering lengths, in contrast to our forms which\nalso reproduce the phase shifts for T\u03c0 \u2264 100 MeV. Furthermore, Ref. [27] is\na nonrelativistic calculation which uses much older values of the scattering\nlengths. In Ref. [16] the \u03b3n channel is taken into account in an unsatisfactory\nway, by using the Panofsky ratio to alter the input value of ac0 in what remains\na two-channel calculation, whereas we have included this channel in the most\nrealistic way possible in a three-channel calculation. In addition, Refs. [16,27]\ndo not take account of the accurate relations given in Ref. [6], between \u2206W\nand acc and between \u03930 and ac0 . This means that our corrections and those\nof Ref. [16] differ by the factors in the parentheses of Eqs. (9,15). For these\nreasons, we consider that our calculations supersede the earlier potential model\ncalculations in Refs. [16,27].\nA quite different method of calculating the EM corrections is used in Ref. [13].\nIn a nonrelativistic approach using Coulomb wave functions, with a shortrange hadronic interaction and extended charge distributions of \u03c0 \u2212 and p, the\nauthors identify four components of the corrections. Two are the contributions\nfrom the interference of V vp and V ext with the hadronic potential Ve ; the other\ntwo are a renormalisation term and a gauge term. The interference terms\nare obtained using an argument based on the change at the origin in the\nnonrelativistic 1s wave function arising from V pc , when V vp and V ext are\nadded to V pc . This is a purely EM calculation, and the results are therefore\n15\n\n\fclaimed to be independent of Ve . We can see no theoretical justification for\nthis procedure of artificially introducing the wave function at the origin as\na replacement for the lowest Bohr energy in the DGBT formulae, and then\ncalculating corrections via changes in this wave function. Moreover, while the\nshift in the 1s level position due to the interference of V vp with Ve happens to\nbe correct (\u22120.0034 eV), that for V ext comes out to be +0.0060 eV, whereas\nthe correct result is +0.0034 eV, which gives the cancellation reported in\nSection 2 and in Ref. [16]. The subthreshold calculation discussed in Section\n2 shows that these contributions separately have a significant variation with\nthe range of the hadronic potential, and we have given the error which results\nfrom this for the sum of the contributions. Ref. [13] also incorrectly says that\nthe results given there for the interference contributions agree with those given\nin Ref. [16].\nWhile Ref. [13] has a discussion of the multichannel situation in Subsection\n2.2, it does not explicitly give the terms which appear in parentheses in our\nEqs. (9,15), nor are these (admittedly small) terms taken into account in\ntheir corrections. Further, we cannot see any corrections in Ref. [13] which\ncorrespond to the corrections due to external mass differences appearing in\nEqs. (28,29).\nThat leaves the renormalisation and gauge terms in Ref. [13]. Each of these\nterms involves an integral over the extended charge distributions, so it appears\nthat some of the effect of extended charges is contained in these terms. In our\napproach, however, V ext is fully accounted for by its direct contribution to\nthe position of the 1s level and the interference of V ext with Ve . It also does\nnot seem possible to see where the interference of V pc with Ve , which gives\nthe corrections designated (pc) in Eqs. (28,29), appears in the corrections of\nRef. [13]. So here we deal with two very different approaches to the calculation\nof the EM corrections, with no discernible way of comparing them.\nFurther, the gauge terms in Ref. [13], for the corrections to acc and ac0 , are\nmuch more uncertain than is claimed there. They are proportional to the range\nparameters bhcc and bhc0 respectively, which appear in the low energy expansions\nof Kcc and Kc0 . Ref. [13] uses for these quantities values given in Ref. [28],\ntaken from a PSA of \u03c0N scattering data obtained before 1983. Practically\nnone of these data were used in our recent PSA [9]. The numbers in Ref. [28]\nare no longer of any value. Moreover, as we explained at the end of Section\n3, because of the violation of isospin invariance in the electromagnetically\nmodified hadronic interaction, the PSA of Ref. [9] does not lead to a reliable\nestimate of \u00e3cc . For b\u0303cc the situation is even more uncertain. The value obtained\nfrom the PSA cannot be accepted as a reliable determination; it is merely a\nrough guess based on phase shifts for qc & 80 MeV/c. The same holds for b\u0303c0 .\nIt is not possible at present to obtain reliable values of the range parameters\nfrom a PSA. As a result, the values of the EM corrections proposed in Ref. [13]\n16\n\n\fare quite uncertain.\nIn our calculations, the range parameters are replaced by potentials which, as\nexplained in Refs. [10,22], are constructed to reproduce the phase shifts for\nqc & 80 MeV/c. The lack of experimental data at very low energies increases\nthe uncertainty in the potentials; it allows a wider interval of values of the\ngaussian range parameter a which yield acceptable fits than would otherwise\nbe the case. We have taken this uncertainty in a into account in the estimates\nof the errors in our corrections given in Eq. (30).\nIn Ref. [29] the dispersive EM correction to acc which arises from the radiative\nprocesses \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03b3X(X = n, \u2206) is calculated in the heavy baryon limit. Table\n1 of Ref. [29] gives the correction \u2206acc (\u03b3n) = 0.00424(13), while our result\n(Eq. (28)) is 0.00363(72) fm. These two results, which have been obtained in\ncompletely different ways, agree quite well. The case X = \u2206 is very different.\nIn the potential model, the effect of a \u03b3\u2206 intermediate state is a residual EM\ncontribution to Ve , and has to be calculated in another way. The result given\nin Table 1 of Ref. [29] is \u2206acc (\u03b3\u2206) = +0.00332 fm. There is no other estimate\nof this correction. One should note that diagrams with a \u03b3\u03c0N intermediate\nstate in principle appear in the calculation of Ref. [30], which we shall discuss\nin a moment, but at a higher order in the perturbation expansion. An effect\ndue to \u03b3\u2206 as large as that given in Ref. [29] would imply that higher orders\nof the expansion give contributions which are comparable in magnitude to the\none-loop result given in Ref. [30].\nGasser et al. [30] have made a calculation of the EM correction to acc using baryon chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) in the infrared regularisation.\nThe calculation was carried out up to diagrams containing one loop; it is a\ncalculation of the complete EM correction to acc to this order. An unambiguous splitting of this correction into stage 1 and stage 2 components is a\nvery difficult task, and may not even be possible (for example, due to the\nultraviolet divergences). Nevertheless we can say that some parts of the correction correspond to the effects calculated (to all orders) with our potential\nmodel. In addition, there are much more important parts of the correction\nof Ref. [30], which are not taken into account in our calculation. They give a\nlarge negative correction which swamps the small correction \u22061 acc in Eq. (30).\nUnfortunately, this correction is very uncertain, due to a lack of knowledge of\nthe low energy constant f1 .\nFor the width, there is a calculation using baryon ChPT reported in Ref. [31],\nbut only to lowest order (no loops). It contains contributions which are not\naccounted for in the potential model calculation; the total contribution is\npositive, but very small compared with the correction \u22061 ac0 in Eq. (30).\n17\n\n\f5\n\nViolation of isospin invariance\n\nIf the electromagnetically modified hadronic interaction were to satisfy isospin\ninvariance, we would have the equality\n\u00e3cc +\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u00e3c0 = \u00e3+ ,\n\nwhere \u00e3+ is the s-wave scattering length for elastic \u03c0 + p scattering. The value\nof \u00e3+ needs to be determined by means of a PSA of low energy \u03c0 + p scattering\ndata, using EM corrections calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of the corrections in Eq. (30). Our analysis [9] of the \u03c0 + p scattering\ndata for T\u03c0 \u2264 100 MeV gives\n\u00e3+ = \u22120.1062(55) fm .\n\n(32)\n\nWhen the analysis is made of a database which combines \u03c0 + p and \u03c0 \u2212 p elastic\nscattering data up to 100 MeV, using a more restrictive model for the fitting,\nthe value of \u00e3+ is practically unaltered, but the error decreases from (55) to\n(23). For the purpose of testing for isospin invariance, the larger uncertainty\nin Eq. (32) should be used.\nFrom the results in Eq. (31) we have\n\u00e3cc +\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u00e3c0 = \u22120.1271(31) fm .\n\n(33)\n\nAlmost all the error in Eq. (33) arises from the uncertainty in \u00e3c0 . Reducing the error in \u0393 to 1% would reduce the uncertainty in Eq. (33) to (17).\nThe difference between the numbers in Eqs. (32,33) is 0.0209(63) fm, which\namounts to 3.3 standard deviations. This is evidence for a significant violation\nof isospin invarance at the electromagnetically modified hadronic level. If the\nexperiment [3] achieves its hoped for accuracy for the measurement of \u0393, the\nerror in the difference will change from (63) to (58). If the result for \u0393 remains\napproximately the same, the difference will become even more significant.\nThis result strengthens the evidence for the violation of isospin invariance\nat the electromagnetically modified hadronic level given in Ref. [9], which\ncomes from the inability of the phase shifts obtained from the analysis of the\ncombined \u03c0 \u00b1 p elastic scattering data to reproduce the data on the charge\nexchange reaction \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n.\n18\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Detlev Gotta for communicating to us the current results of\nthe PSI pionic hydrogen experiment, and to J\u00fcrg Gasser and Akaki Rusetsky\nfor their helpful answers to our questions concerning the work of the Bern\ngroup.
