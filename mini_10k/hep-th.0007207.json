The backreaction comes\nfrom an R2 term which is a part of the one-loop effective action arising from massive scalar\nfield quantization in a certain approximation. The peculiarity of this term is that it does not\ncontribute to the Hawking radiation of the classical black hole solution of the field equations.\nIn the static case we examine the horizon and the physical singularity of the new black hole\nsolutions. Studying the possibility of time dependence we see the generation of a new singularity.\nThe particular solution found still has the structure of a black hole, indicating that non-thermal\neffects cannot lead, at least in this approximation, to black hole evaporation.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwo-dimensional dilaton gravity is a useful laboratory for addressing fundamental questions of quantum gravity. It exhibits many of the interesting non-trivial features of four\ndimensional gravity, describing the s-wave sector of four dimensional Einstein gravity, and\nespecially black hole solutions [1] permiting a study of the interplay between gravity and\nquantum mechanics. This fact combined with the stringy origin of the action justifies the\npersisting activity in the field.\nIn a previous work [2] the Hawking radiation due to the presence of quantum scalar\nmassive particles has been calculated. One of the results of this work was that purely\ngeometrical terms (not including the dilaton field) in the one-loop effective action do not\ncontribute to the thermal radiation. This observation raises the question of the evolution\nof a Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of such terms. The first of these terms\nin the one-loop effective action, in a large mass expansion, is just an R2 term. Thus\ntwo-dimensional higher derivative gravity is interesting for one more reason. It can in\nprinciple give information about non-thermal effects of quanrum origin, in black hole\npfysics. Backreaction effects including this term were considered in [3], where static black\nhole geometries were found as solutions of the field equations of the two dimensional\ndilaton gravity with R2 term. The existence of these solutions viewed as backreaction\neffects is compatible with the fact that the extra terms do not contribute to the Hawking\nradiation but in no way can say something about the evolution of the original black hole\nlike the case, for example, of the Russo, Susskind, Thorlacius model [4].\nIn this work we try to incorporate time dependence in the backreaction effects due to\nthe presence of the R2 term. In section 2 we formulate the problem and give the field\nequations both in covariant form and in the conformal gauge using light cone coordinates,\nwhich are more convenient to incorporate time dependence. In section 3 we point out\nthe basic features of the static solutions found in [3]. The analysis here is presented in\nthe abovementioned coordinate system giving emphasis in the study of the region behind\nthe event horizon and in the appearence of the singularity. This discussion completes\nthe results of [3]. In section 4 we consider the non-static case. We find time-dependent\nsolutions expanding in powers of the coefficient (\u03ba) of the R2 term . In \u03ba2 order we find\nsolutions with black hole structure differing from the static case mainly in the appearence\nof an extra physical singularity. Up to this order the solution found has striking similarity\nto the one found in [5]. In this reference the corresponding solution was an exact solution\nof the field equations in the presence of non-trivial (classical) tachyon configuration. We\nconclude with a discussion of our results in section 5.\n\n2\n\nSetting the problem\n\nThe classical action of a scalar field coupled to the two-dimensional gravity (and to the\ndilaton field) is\nScl =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212ge\u22122\u03c6 {[R + 4(\u2207\u03c6)2 + 4\u03bb2 ] \u2212 [(\u2207T )2 \u2212 m0 T 2 ]}\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhile the rescaling T = e\u2212\u03c6 T\u0303 giving to the scalar field canonical kinetic terms yields:\n1\nScl =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212ge\u22122\u03c6 {[R + 4(\u2207\u03c6)2 + 4\u03bb2 ] \u2212 [(\u2207T\u0303 )2 + ((\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u2737\u03c6 \u2212 m20 )T\u0303 2 ]}.\n\n(2)\n\nNote that the term ((\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u2737\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bb2 )T\u0303 2 gives the quadratic coupling of the scalar\nfield to the dilaton, being zero in the linear dilaton vacuum, while m2 = \u03bb2 \u2212 m20 is the\n\"mass\" of the scalar field.\nQuantizing the scalar field one can take the one-loop effective action, which contains\nboth local and non-local terms [6], [2]. Expanding the purely geometric part of the nonlocal terms (which are responsible for the Hawking radiation) in inverse powers of the\nmass m2 and keeping the first term [3] we get\nS = Scl \u2212 \u03ba\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gR2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 1/(240m2 ). Since we are not interested in this work in non-trivial scalar field\nconfigurations we consider the metric and dilaton equations which read:\n\u2212 2e\u22122\u03c6 [g\u03bc\u03bd ((\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u2737\u03c6 \u2212 1) + \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c6] \u2212 \u03ba[2\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u2212\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd 2\nR \u2212 2g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737R] = 0,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nR\n\u2212 [(\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 \u2737\u03c6 \u2212 1]} = 0\n(5)\n4\nIn the following we'll work in the conformal gauge and light-cone coordinates (x+ , x\u2212 )\nwhere the line element reads\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03c1 dx+ dx\u2212\n(6)\ne\u22122\u03c6 {\n\n2\n2\nand the components of the Ricci tensor take the form R++ = \u22122\u2202+\n\u03c1, R\u2212\u2212 = \u22122\u2202\u2212\n\u03c1 and\n\u22122\u03c1\n\u22122\u03c1\nR = 8e \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1 while for a scalar field f we have \u2737f = \u22124e \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 f .\nIn this gauge the dilaton equation becomes\n\ne\u22122\u03c6 {1 + 2e\u22122\u03c1 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1 + 4e\u22122\u03c1 [\u2202+ \u03c6\u2202\u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c6]} = 0\n\n(7)\n\nwhile from the equations for the metric components we get the trace equation\n1\n\u2212 e2(\u03c1\u2212\u03c6) + e\u22122\u03c6 (\u22124\u2202+ \u03c6\u2202\u2212 \u03c6 + 2\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c6) + \u03ba(2\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 R \u2212 e2\u03c1 R2 ) = 0\n4\nand the two constraints\n2\n2\ne\u22122\u03c6 (2\u2202\u2212\n\u03c6 \u2212 4\u2202\u2212 \u03c6\u2202\u2212 \u03c1) + \u03ba(4\u2202\u2212 \u03c1\u2202\u2212 R \u2212 2\u2202\u2212\nR) = 0\n\u22122\u03c6\n2\n2\ne (2\u2202+ \u03c6 \u2212 4\u2202+ \u03c6\u2202+ \u03c1) + \u03ba(4\u2202+ \u03c1\u2202+ R \u2212 2\u2202+ R) = 0\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nNote that combining the trace (8) and the dilaton (7) equations we get the relation\n2e\u22122\u03c6 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c6) = \u03ba[16e\u22122\u03c1 (\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1)2 \u2212 16\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 (e\u22122\u03c1 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1)].\n\n(11)\n\n\fWe see that when \u03ba = 0 we recover the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c6 symmetry [1],[4]. The system admits in\nthis case the solution\ne\u22122\u03c6 = e\u22122\u03c1 = M \u2212 x+ x\u2212\n\n(12)\n\nfor the conformal factor and the dilaton field while for the Ricci scalar we take:\nR\u03ba=0 = 4Me2\u03c1 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe solution in (12), unique in the \u03ba = 0 case, describes either a static black hole solution\n(M 6= 0) or flat space (M = 0) [1]. The presence of the backreaction terms (\u03ba 6= 0), spoils\nthe \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c6 symmetry leading to new static solutions and permitting time dependence.\n\n3\n\nStatic Solutions\n\nStatic black hole solutions emerging from the Lagrangian in (3) have already been found\nin [3] (and in somehow different context in [7]) where the Schwarzschild coordinate system\nwas adopted. In this section we will reconsider the basic features of these solutions working\nin the conformal gauge mainly for use in the time dependent case.\nFor static solutions we consider the fields as functions of the combination \u2212x+ x\u2212 only.\nThis is clear from the fact that the coordinates x\u00b1 are related to the physical spacetime\n+\n\u2212\nconformal coordinates through the relations x+ = e\u03c3 , x\u2212 = \u2212e\u03c3 , where \u03c3 \u00b1 = 21 (t \u00b1 x),\n\u2212\nor conversely x = ln(\u2212x+ x\u2212 ), t = \u2212ln(\u2212 xx+ ).\nThe system of the equations is a fourth order one, due to the presence of the R2 term\nin the action. In order to reduce the order we assume the field \u03c1 is monotonic function\nof the variable x+ x\u2212 . This is always possible since the number of degrees of freedom (\u03c1\nand \u03c6 in our case) is less than the number of equations so one of the degrees of freedom\ncan have this property. Note that the dilaton field cannot be a monotonic function as we\nhave seen from the analysis in [3]. The above monotonicity property is also true in fourdimensional black hole solutions [8]. The non-monotonicity of the dilaton is explained by\nthe fact that the R2 forces are repulsive. Furthermore we introduce the \"auxiliary\" field\nA(\u03c1) through the relation:\nR(x+ , x\u2212 ) = 8e\u22122\u03c1 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1 = 8e\u22122\u03c1 A(\u03c1).\n\n(14)\n\nand we also consider the dilaton field being function of \u03c1, \u03c6(\u03c1). Writting the system\nof equations in terms of A(\u03c1) and \u03c6(\u03c1) and eliminating the derivatives of \u03c1 we are left\nwith an ordinary non-linear system. For this system we seek solutions analytic in the\nparameter \u03ba written in the form of \u03ba-series as\nA(\u03c1) = A1 (\u03c1) + \u03baA2 (\u03c1) + ...\n\u03c6(\u03c1) = \u03c1 + \u03baH1 (\u03c1) + \u03ba2 H2 (\u03c1) + ...\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere H(\u03c1) = \u03baH1 (\u03c1) + \u03ba2 H2 (\u03c1) + ... denotes the deviation from the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c6 symmetry in\nthe presence of the R2 terms. For convenience in the integration of the equations we use\none more auxiliary field:\nh(\u03c1) = e\u22122\u03c1 \u2212 F (\u03c1; \u03ba) = M \u2212 x+ x\u2212 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe solution of the resultant system up to \u03ba4 -order reads:\n1\n64(41472 \u2212 733M10 ) 3 6\u03c1\nA(\u03c1) = M10 e4\u03c1 [ + 16\u03bae2\u03c1 + 16\u03ba2 (96 \u2212 M10 )e4\u03c1 +\n\u03ba e ]\n2\n9\n512 2\u03c1\n41472 \u2212 437M10 4\u03c1\n\u03c6(\u03c1) = \u03c1 + \u03baM10 e4\u03c1 [1 +\n\u03bae + \u03ba2\ne ]\n(17)\n9\n6\nwhile the dependence of the fields on the spacetime coordinates is given through the field\nh(\u03c1) up to \u03ba2 -order by\nh(\u03c1) = e\u22122\u03c1 \u2212 8\u03ba2 M10 e2\u03c1 + O(\u03ba3 ) = M \u2212 x+ x\u2212\n\n(18)\n\nThe expression of the solutions in \u03ba-expansion will be proven helpful in the timedependent case but since it appears arbitrary 1 we will justify it before proceeding in the\ndiscussion of the solutions. Since the solutions we seek for have to meet the asymptotic\nflatness condition, the fields A(\u03c1), H(\u03c1) have vanishing limit as \u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. So we can solve\nthe nonlinear system of equations by iteration following the method adopted in [3]. The\nlinearized system reads:\nH\n\n\u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nA\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= 2e\u22122\u03c1 (A \u2212 4A) + 8\u03ba(\u2212A + 4A \u2212 4A) + H\n1 \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n= 4A \u2212 4A + H\n8\u03ba\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(19)\n\nwhich after the elimination of the field H yields an equation for A namely\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(4A \u2212 A ) + 4\u03bae2\u03c1 (4A \u2212 4A + A\u2032\u2032\u2032 ) = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nThe solution of this equation is:\nA(z) =\n\nc2\n1\nc1\nI1 (z) + K1 (z) + c3 Im[ S\u22122,1 (iz)]\nz\nz\nz\n\n(21)\n\n\u2212\u03c1\n\nwhere z = 2e\u221a\u03ba , I1 , K1 are the modified Bessel functions, S\u22122,1 is the Lommel function\nand the ci 's are integration constants.\nNow if we write the system as a quasi-linear first order system\n~ \u2032 (\u03c1) = B(\u03c1)X(\u03c1)\n~\n~ X),\n~\nX\n+ F(\n\n(22)\n\nwhere B is a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix giving the linear part of the system,\n~ T = (0, 0, FH , 0, FA )\nF\n1\n\n(23)\n\nIn fact analitycity in \u03ba comes from the general theory for non-linear ordinary differential systems.\n\n\fdenotes the non-linear terms, and\n~ T = (H(\u03c1), H \u2032 (\u03c1), H \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1), A(\u03c1), A\u2032 (\u03c1)).\nX(\u03c1)\n\n(24)\n\nThe solution in (21) can be used to produce a fundamental solution Y(\u03c1) of the linear\npart of (22). Then the full (asymptotically stable) solution is given iteratively in the form:\n~ n (\u03c1) = X\n~ (n\u22121) (\u03c1) +\nX\n\n\u03c1\n\nZ\n\n~ X\n~ (n\u22121) (t)]dt\nY(\u03c1)Y \u22121 (t)F[\n\n(25)\n\nWe don't present here the corresponding expressions because they are too lengthy. Working out the first iteration we see that the \u03ba-series solution (17) coincides with the asymptotic expansion of the exact solution taken by the iteration scheme confirming, at least\nasymtotically, the analyticity in the parameter \u03ba.\nNote that the position of the apparent horizon (coinciding with the event horizon in\nthe static case) is given by\n\u2202+ \u03c1 = \u2212x\u2212 J(\u03c1) = 0,\n(26)\n\n1\nwhere J(\u03c1) = \u2202\u03c1 h(\u03c1)\n. In the case of the C.G.H.S. black hole [1] we have Jc (\u03c1) = \u2212 21 e2\u03c1\nleading to the unique apparent horizon, coinciding with the event horizon, at x\u2212 = 0. In\nour case the function J(\u03c1) is more complicated leaving room for other solutions of (26).\nSubstituting the derivatives of \u03c1 from the constaints in (10) we get the equation for the\nfield J(\u03c1) which keeping terms up to second order reads\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nJ (\u03c1) = 2J(\u03c1) \u2212 2J(\u03c1)H (\u03c1).\n\n(27)\n\nFrom the second of equations in (19) and taking into account that R(2) (\u03c1) = 8e\u22122\u03c1 A(\u03c1)\nthe equation (19) can be written as\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nJ (\u03c1) = 2J(\u03c1) \u2212 2\u03baJ(\u03c1)e2\u03c1 R(2) (\u03c1).\n\n(28)\n\nThe solution of the linear part is taken to be Jlin (\u03c1) = Jc (\u03c1) = \u2212 21 e2\u03c1 . Since the field\nJ does not appear in the system (19) it is easy to enlarge the system including also the\nequation (28) and to work out the first iteration. Thus we can take an expression for the\nfield J(\u03c1). We see now that J(\u03c1) has a zero at some x+ x\u2212 = constant < 0. The new\napparent horizon appears when J(\u03c1H ) = 0. So we see that the backreaction effects shift\nthe horizon in the physical spacetime region of the C.G.H.S. case namely on an hyperbola\nx+ x\u2212 = constant < 0.\nIn order to investigate the existence of the singularity we will make some comments\nfor the function h(\u03c1) (in fact the implicit dependence of \u03c1 on the space coordinate). Using\nthe ansatz in (15) in the form \u03c6(\u03c1) = \u03c1 + H(\u03c1) the dilaton equation is written as:\n\u22122\u03c1\n\n1 + \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 e\n\nH\n\n+ e \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 {\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\ne\u22122y\u2212H(y) [\u22124H \u2032 (y)]dy} = 0.\n\n(29)\n\nMultiplying by appropriate factor the above equation can be formally integrated to give:\n\u22122\u03c1\n\nh(\u03c1) = e\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\ne\u22122y\u2212F (y) [\u22124H \u2032 (y)]dy\n\n(30)\n\n\fwhere F (\u03c1) satisfies the equation\ne\u2212F \u2212H [\u2212F \u2032 (H \u2032 + 2H \u20322 ) + (2H \u20323 + H \u2032\u2032 )] + (e\u2212H )\u2032\u2032 = 0.\n\n(31)\n\nThis equation can be solved exactly to give the function F (\u03c1) in terms of H(\u03c1). Instead\nof giving the lengthy expression for F we investigate its behaviour near the singularity\n(\u03c1 \u2192 \u221e). The relevant terms in (31) give the (asymptotic) equation\ne\u2212F F \u2032 (\u22122H \u20322 ) + e\u2212F (2H \u20323 ) = 0\n\n(32)\n\nFsing (\u03c1) \u223c Hsing (\u03c1).\n\n(33)\n\nwith solution\n\nSo the function h(\u03c1) behaves near the singularity as:\n\u22122\u03c1\n\nhsing (\u03c1) = e\n\n\u22122\u03c1\u2212H\n\n+ 4e\n\n\u22122\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\ne\u22122y\u2212H(y) dy.\n\n(34)\n\nSince the function e\u2212H(\u03c1) vanishes very rapidly near the singularity (H(\u03c1) \u2192 +\u221e as\n\u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e), we see that h(\u03c1) remains a positive function going to zero as \u03c1 \u2192 +\u221e. From\nthe definition of h(\u03c1) in (16) we see that this happens when x+ x\u2212 = M.\nAs far as the asymptotically flat region is concerned (\u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) the equation (31) is\napproximated by:\n\nadmitting the general solution\n\ne\u2212F (H \u2032\u2032 \u2212 F \u2032 H \u2032 ) \u2212 H \u2032\u2032 = 0\n\n(35)\n\nH \u2032 (\u03c1) \u2212 c\nFas (\u03c1) = \u2212Log\nH \u2032 (\u03c1)\n\n(36)\n\n\"\n\n#\n\nwhich with the choice c = 0 gives\nFas (\u03c1) = 0.\n\n(37)\n\nThen as is easily recognized from the dilaton equation, keeping only linear terms in\nthe field H(\u03c1),\n\u22122\u03c1\n\nhas (\u03c1) = e\n\n\u22122\u03c1\n\n+ 2\u03bae\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\ne2y R\u2032\u2032 (y)dy \u2212 2\u03baR\u2032 (\u03c1)\n\n(38)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that asymptotically\nH \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1) = \u03bae2\u03c1 R\u2032\u2032 (\u03c1).\n\n(39)\n\nSubstituting from (21) the expression R \u223c zIm[S\u22122,1 (iz)] we find that\nz2\nh(z) = 4\u03ba z \u2212\n2\n\"\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n#\n\nRe[S\u22121,0 (iu)]\ndu .\nu\n\n(40)\n\nThe above analysis convinces about the monotonicity of \u03c1 as a function of x+ x\u2212 which\nwas anticipated in the begining of this section. For the singularity we have to make two\n\n\fcomments. The first is that in this analysis comes out naturally that the geometry of the\nspacetime has a physical singularity. This could not be seen from the numerical solutions\nin the Schwarzschild gauge as e.g. in [9], [3]. The second remark is that unlike the\nC.G.H.S. case the constant M appearing in (16) is not the mass of the black hole. Thus it\ncan take negative values also. This means that there exist R2 black hole solutions which\nhave both their horizon and their singularity lying in different hyperbolae in the physical\nspacetime region of the C.G.H.S. geometry.\n\n4\n\nTime dependence\n\nIn order to incorporate the time dependence we keep \u03c1 as one of the variables but we\nallow explicit dependence on x+ also. In particular the implicit dependence of \u03c1 on the\nvariable x+ x\u2212 of the static case (16) is replaced now by the ansatz:\nh(x+ , \u03c1) = G(x+ ) \u2212 x\u2212 F (x+ )\n\n(41)\n\nh(x+ , \u03c1) = e\u22122\u03c1 + \u03bah1 (x+ , \u03c1).\n\n(42)\n\nwhere F (x+ ) must be a monotonic function and the left hand side has the form:\n\nWhen \u03ba = 0 we get the well known solution with G(x+ ) constant and F (x+ ) = x+ .\nHaving in mind an evolution scheme we make the following ansatz for the fields \u03c6 and\n\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1:\n\u03c6 = \u03c1 + fst (\u03c1; \u03ba) + \u03baH(x+ , \u03c1)\n\u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1 = Ast (\u03c1; \u03ba) + \u03baA(x+ , \u03c1)\n\n(43)\n(44)\n\nwhere fst (\u03c1; \u03ba) and Ast (\u03c1; \u03ba) are the solutions found in the static case.\nNow the system of equations (7, 8, 10) becomes:\n(dil)\n\n1 + B1\n(dil)\n\n(dil)\n\n(x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u03c1) +\n\n(x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u03c1)(\u2202+ \u03c1) + B3 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u2202+ \u03c1)\nB0+\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1) + B1+\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u03c1)\nB2+\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u03c1)(\u2202+ \u03c1) + B3+\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u2202+ \u03c1)\n2\n\u03c1)\nB2\u2212\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212 \u03c1)2 + B3\u2212\u2212 (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202\u2212\n++ +\n++ +\nB0 (x , \u03c1) + B1 (x , \u03c1)(\u2202+ \u03c1)\n++ +\n2\nB2 (x , \u03c1)(\u2202+ \u03c1)2 + B3++ (x+ , \u03c1)(\u2202+\n\u03c1)\n\nB2\n\n=\n+\n=\n=\n+\n=\n\n0,\n0,\n0,\n0,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere Bij 's are expressions of the fields fst (\u03c1) , Ast (\u03c1), H(x+ , \u03c1), A(x+ , \u03c1) and their\nderivatives very complicated to be presented here. Following a procedure similar to the\none adopted for the static case we eliminate the derivatives of the field \u03c1 using the ansatz\nin (42) and the form of the third of the equations in (45).\n\n\fThe resultant system is a highly non-linear partial differential system hard to be solved.\nInstead having in mind the method which has been exposed in the case of the static\nproblem we seek solutions in \u03ba-series expansion. The general solution of this system for\nthe fields up to order \u03ba2 comes to be the following\n\u03c6(x+ , \u03c1) = \u03c1(x+ , x\u2212 ) +\n\n\u03bac0\n,\n4F02 (x+ )\n\n(46)\n\nand\n2\n\ne\u22122\u03c1 = c8 e\u2212\u03bac0 /2F0 (x\n\n+)\n\n2\n\n+ F02 (x+ )(c7 \u2212 x\u2212 )e\u2212\u03bac0 /2F0 (x\n\n+)\n\n+ (8c4 \u03ba + 4\u03ba2 c6 )F02 (x+ ),\n\n(47)\n\nwhere ci 's are integration constants. In the above the integration constant c8 has to be\nnon-negative, since when \u03ba = 0 coincides with the mass parameter of the Schwarzschild\nsolution. Furthermore the function F0 (x+ ) satisfies the equation\n\u2032\n\nF0 (x+ ) =\n\n1\n2 +\ne\u03bac0 /2F0 (x )\n+\n2F0 (x )\n\n(48)\n\nwith solution given in implicit form by\n2\n\nx+ = F02 (x+ )e\u2212\u03bac0/2F0 (x\n\n+)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bac0\n\u03bac0\nEi (\u2212\n),\n2\n2F0 (x+ )2\n\n(49)\n\nwhere Ei is the exponential integral function.\ndesired asymptotic behaviour of\n\u221a from the\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nF0 , F0 (x ) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0 and F0 (x ) \u2192 x as x \u2192 +\u221e, the constant c0 has to be\npositive and thus F0 is a monotonic function of x+ .\nFor the Ricci scalar R = 8e\u22122\u03c1 \u2202+ \u2202\u2212 \u03c1 we get the expression\nR = 4e2\u03c1(x\n\n+ ,x\u2212 )\n\n2\n\n{c8 e\u03bac0 /2F0 (x\n\n+)\n\n\u2212 2c0 (2c4 \u03ba2 + c6 \u03ba3 )}\n\n(50)\n\nAt this point we notice the close similarity of the above solution with the exact solution\nfound in [5] where the role of the classical tachyon configuration is played here by the\nfunction [F0 (x+ )]\u22121 . This solution describes a black hole geometry. The event horizon is\nat some x\u2212 = constant. As far as the physical singularity is concerned we see that besides\nthe singularity coming from the zero of e\u22122\u03c1 in (47) we have the curvature blowing up also\nat x+ = 0. As it is explained in [5] this is not a naked singularity but rather an initial one.\nThis extra singularity is a general feature of the solution and is inherently connected to the\ndeviation from staticity. In (46) the singularity appears in \u03ba-order since we introduce timedependence to this order. This could be implemented at higher orders in the \u03ba-expansion\nand in this case we can see that the equation (49) for the corresponding F0 remains the\nsame. If for example we change the relation (46) keeping the static contribution up to \u03ba2\norder then one can see that exactly the same time dependent term F12 , with F0 given by\n0\n(49), emerges at \u03ba3 order, while all the static contribution to the dilaton field disappears.\nIn fact this is the only kind of time dependence permitted if we insist on the analyticity\nin the parameter \u03ba. Our analysis cannot exclude solutions non-analytic in \u03ba but such\nsolutions cannot describe an evolution scheme between two static black hole geometries\nsince these, are analytic in \u03ba.\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we consider solutions of two-dimensional dilaton gravity with R2 term which\ncan be viewed as backreaction term from quantization of matter. Of course this term\nhas interest by itself considered as R2 gravity but we emphasize its quantum origin and\nthe fact that, in the semiclassical approximation, it does not contribute to the Hawking\nradiation [2]. We confirm the static solutions found in [3] working in the conformal gauge\nand using light-cone coordinates. As a bonus of the new analysis we find that the black\nhole covers a part of the physical space of the Schwarzschild geometry. In particular the\nhorizon (and eventually the sigularity also) lies in this region. Futhermore we find that\nthe expansion in powers of the coefficient of the R2 term describes well the qualitative\nfeatures of the new geometry. We address also the time dependent problem. We seek for\nsolutions analytic in \u03ba since such solutions have the possibility to describe an ordinary\nevolution scheme between the Schwarzschild black hole and the backreacted static one.\nNevertheless we find that allowing time dependence, even in the manner described above,\nwe have a drastic change of the geometry. A new singularity appears at x+ = 0. We note\nthat the solution found has black hole structure and this reflects the fact that the term\nincluded in the action does not contribute to the thermal radiation. On the other hand\nthe calculation of the Bogoliubov coefficient in this background [10], shows that we have a\nnon-thermal spectrum and hence a thermodynamic instability of the system. We remark\nhere that the horizon of the static R2 black hole, being removed in the physical spacetime\nregion of the Schwarzschild black hole, can in principle cover this extra singularity. This\nin connection with the evolution caused from the thermodynamic instability shows that\nthe backreaction effects are very important for the black hole evolution. We conjecture\nthat these effects may prevent the full evaporation of the black hole [11]. Nevertheless the\nstudy of such a quantum evolution or any other possibility like the one described in [10]\ndemands a more general context beyond the semiclassical approximation adopted here.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.G.
