A leading perturbative approach involves the calculation of\nthe self-force acting upon the smaller orbital body. In this work, we present the first application of\nthe Poisson-Wiseman-Anderson method of 'matched expansions' to compute the self-force acting on\na point particle moving in a curved spacetime. The method employs two expansions for the Green\nfunction which are respectively valid in the 'quasilocal' and 'distant past' regimes, and which may be\nmatched together within the normal neighbourhood. We perform our calculation in a static region\nof the spherically symmetric Nariai spacetime (dS2 \u00d7 S2 ), in which scalar field perturbations are\ngoverned by a radial equation with a P\u00f6schl-Teller potential (frequently used as an approximation\nto the Schwarzschild radial potential) whose solutions are known in closed form.\nThe key new ingredients in our study are: (i) very high order quasilocal expansions, and (ii)\nexpansion of the 'distant past' Green function in quasinormal modes. In combination, these tools\nenable a detailed study of the properties of the scalar-field Green function. We demonstrate that the\nGreen function is singular whenever x and x0 are connected by a null geodesic and apply asymptotic\nmethods to determine the structure of the Green function near the null wavefront. We show that\nthe singular part of the Green function undergoes a transition each time the null wavefront passes\nthrough a caustic point, following a repeating four-fold sequence \u03b4(\u03c3), 1/\u03c0\u03c3, \u2212\u03b4(\u03c3), \u22121/\u03c0\u03c3, etc.,\nwhere \u03c3 is Synge's world function.\nThe matched expansion method provides insight into the non-local properties of the self-force. We\nshow that the self-force generated by the segment of worldline lying outside the normal neighbourhood is not negligible. We apply the matched expansion method to compute the scalar self-force\nacting on a static particle on the Nariai spacetime, and validate against an alternative method,\nobtaining agreement to six decimal places.\nWe conclude with a discussion of the implications for wave propagation and self-force calculations. On black hole spacetimes, any expansion of the Green function in quasinormal modes must\nbe augmented by a branch cut integral. Nevertheless we expect the Green function in Schwarzschild\nspacetime to inherit certain key features, such as a four-fold singular structure linked to the asymptotic behaviour of quasinormal modes. In this way, the Nariai spacetime provides a fertile testing\nground for developing insight into the non-local part of the self-force on black hole spacetimes.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe last decade has seen a surge of interest in the nascent field of gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational\nwaves \u2013 propagating ripples in spacetime \u2013 are generated by some of the most violent processes in the known universe,\nsuch as supernovae, black hole mergers and galaxy collisions. These powerful processes are hidden from the view of\n'traditional' electromagnetic-wave telescopes behind shrouds of dust and radiation. On the other hand, gravitational\nwaves are not strongly absorbed or scattered by intervening matter, and carry information about the dynamics at\nthe heart of such processes. The prospects seem good for direct detection of gravitational waves in the near future.\nA number of ground-based detectors (such as LIGO [1], VIRGO [2] and GEO600 [3]) are now in the data collection\nphase.\nGravitational wave astronomy will enter a new era with the launch of the first space-based observatory: the Laser\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nmarc.casals@dcu.ie\nsam.dolan@ucd.ie\nadrian.ottewill@ucd.ie\nbarry.wardell@ucd.ie\n\n\f2\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [4]. It is hoped that this joint NASA/ESA mission, presently in the design and\nplanning phase, will be launched within a decade. It will be preceded by a pathfinder mission, due for launch at the\nend of this year [5].\nBlack hole binary systems are a key target for gravitational wave (GW) observatories worldwide. Data analysis\nmethods such as matched filtering may be applied to separate a weak GW signal from a noisy background [6]. An\nessential prerequisite for detection via matched filtering is accurate templates for the gravitational wave emission\nfrom black hole binaries. Breakthroughs in numerical relativity in the last five years have led to a rapid advance in\nthe modelling of comparable-mass binaries, where the partners are of similar mass. Progress in numerical relativity\ncontinues apace.\nA key target for the LISA mission are the so-called Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs): compact binaries in\nwhich one partner (mass M ) is significantly more massive than the other (mass m). Mass ratios of \u03bc \u2261 m/M & 10\u22128\nare possible, for example for a solar-mass black hole orbiting a supermassive black hole [7]. Mass ratios of up to\nm/M \u223c 1/10 have been studied by numerical relativists [8]; smaller ratios are presently beyond the scope of numerical\nrelativity due to the existence of two distinct and dissimilar length scales in the system. Perturbative approaches\nseem more likely to succeed in the extreme-mass regime.\nThe smaller compact mass m distorts the curvature of the spacetime in which it is moving. Hence, rather than\nfollowing a geodesic of the background spacetime generated by the larger mass M , the smaller mass follows a geodesic\nof the total spacetime [9]. However, if the mass ratio is extreme, the deviation of the smaller body's motion from the\nbackground geodesic will be (locally) small. The deviation may be interpreted as arising from a self-force, created\nby the smaller mass m interacting with its own gravitational field. To leading order, the self-force acceleration is\nproportional to m. With knowledge of the leading term in the self-force, one may model the evolution of the orbit\nand subsequent inspiral of the smaller mass, and compute the gravitational wave emission to high accuracy. However,\nfinding the instantaneous self-force in a curved spacetime is not at all straightforward; it turns out to depend on the\nentire past history of the smaller mass, m.\nThe idea of a self-force has a long history in physics. In the late 19th century it was well-known that a charge\nundergoing an acceleration in flat spacetime will generate electromagnetic radiation, and will feel a corresponding\nradiation reaction. The self-acceleration of a charged point particle in flat spacetime is given by the well-known\nAbraham-Lorentz-Dirac formula [10]. Radiation reaction implies that the 'classical' model of the atom (a pointparticle electron orbiting a compact nucleus) is unstable. The observed stability of the atom remained a puzzle for\nmany years, and provided a key motivation for the development of quantum mechanics. In the 1960s, DeWitt and\nBrehme [11] derived a formula for the self-force acting on an electrically-charged point particle in a curved background,\nand a correction was later provided by Hobbs [12]. The gravitational self-force acting on a point mass was found in\n1997 by two groups working concurrently and independently: Mino, Sasaki and Tanaka [13] and Quinn and Wald [14].\nShortly after, Quinn derived the self-force acting on a minimally-coupled scalar charge [15]. These developments are\nsummarized in 2004/05 reviews by Poisson [16] and Detweiler [17]. In the subsequent period, a range of complementary\napproaches to the self-force problem have been developed [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\nThe self-force expressions for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational cases take similar form [16]. In this paper,\nwe restrict our attention to the simplest case: a point-like scalar charge q of mass m coupled to a massless scalar field\n\u03a6(x) moving on a curved background geometry. The scalar field \u03a6(x) satisfies the field equation\n(\u0003 \u2212 \u03beR) \u03a6(x) = \u22124\u03c0\u03c1(x)\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere \u0003 is the d'Alembertian on the curved background created by the larger mass M , R is the Ricci scalar, and \u03be\nis the curvature coupling constant. The charge density, \u03c1, of the point particle is\nZ\n\u03b4 4 (x\u03bc \u2212 z \u03bc (\u03c4 ))\n\u221a\n\u03c1(x) =\nq\nd\u03c4\n(1.2)\n\u2212g\n\u03b3\nwhere z(\u03c4 ) describes the worldline \u03b3 of the particle with proper time \u03c4 , g\u03bc\u03bd is the background metric, g = det(g\u03bc\u03bd ),\nand \u03b4 4 (*) is the four-dimensional Dirac distribution. The field exerts a radiation reaction on the particle, creating a\nself-force [15]\nf\u03bcself = q\u2207\u03bc \u03a6R\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich leads to the equations of motion for the scalar particle\nma\u03bc = (g \u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd )f\u03bdself = q(g \u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd )\u2207\u03bd \u03a6R\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere u\u03bc is the particle's four-velocity and \u03a6R is the radiative part of the field. Identifying the correct radiative field\n(which is regular at the particle's position) is the essential step in the derivation of the self-force [16]. Note that the\n\n\f3\n\u03bc\nprojection operator g \u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd has been applied here to ensure that u\u03bc fself\n= 0. The mass m appearing in (1.4) is\nthe 'dynamical' (and renormalized) particle's mass, which in the scalar case is not necessarily a constant of motion\n[15]. Rather, it evolves according to\n\ndm\n= \u2212qu\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03a6R .\nd\u03c4\n\n(1.5)\n\nIn other words, a spinless particle may radiate away its mass through the emission of monopolar waves.\nA leading method for computing the derivative of the radiative field, \u2207\u03bd \u03a6R , and hence the self-force, is based on\nmode sum regularization (MSR). The MSR approach was developed by Barack, Ori and collaborators [23, 24, 25, 26]\nand Detweiler and coworkers [17, 27, 28]. The method has been applied to the Schwarzschild spacetime to compute,\nfor example, the gravitational self-force for circular orbits [26] and the scalar self-force for eccentric orbits [29]. The\napplication to Kerr is in progress [30, 31]. It was recently shown [32] that the gravitational self-force computed\nin the Lorenz gauge is in agreement with that found in the Regge-Wheeler gauge [17, 27]. Further gauge-invariant\ncomparisons, and comparison with the predictions of Post-Newtonian theory [33, 34] are presently under consideration\n[35].\nOne drawback of the MSR method is that it gives relatively little geometric insight into the physical origin of\nthe self-force. An alternative approach, based on matched expansions, was suggested by Poisson and Wiseman in\n1998 [36]. Their idea was to compute the self-force by matching together two independent expansions for the Green\nfunction, valid in 'quasilocal' and 'distant past' regimes. This suggestion was analysed by Anderson and Wiseman\n[37], who concluded in 2005 that \"this approach remains, in our opinion, in the category of 'promising but possessing\nsome technical challenges'.\" The present paper represents the first practical attempt to implement this method.\nIn the following sections we demonstrate that accurate self-force calculations via matched expansions are indeed\nfeasible. We apply the method to compute the self-force for a scalar charge at fixed position on the product spacetime\ndS2 \u00d7 S2 (i.e. the product of a two-sphere and a two-dimensional de Sitter spacetime) introduced long ago by Nariai\n[38, 39]. We introduce a method for calculating the 'distant past' Green function using an expansion in quasinormal\nmodes. The effect of caustics upon wave propagation is examined. This work is intended to lay a foundation for\nfuture studies of self-force in black hole spacetimes through matched expansions. The prospects for extending the\ncalculation to the Schwarzschild spacetime appear good, although the work remains to be conducted.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we define the self-force and outline the PoissonAnderson-Wiseman method of matched expansions. In Sec. III we consider wave propagation on the Schwarzschild\nspacetime. A radial equation of standard form is obtained via the well-known 'trick' of replacing the Schwarzschild\npotential with a so-called 'P\u00f6schl-Teller' potential. We show that a P\u00f6schl-Teller potential arises more naturally if we\nconsider wave propagation on the 'Nariai' spacetime, whose properties are described in detail.\nSection IV is concerned with the scalar Green function on the Nariai spacetime. We begin in Sec. IV A by expressing\nthe Green function as a mode sum over angular modes and integral over frequency. We show in Sec. IV B that\nperforming the integral over frequency leaves a sum of residues: a so-called 'quasinormal mode sum', which may be\nmatched onto a 'quasilocal' Green function, briefly described in Sec. IV C.\nIn Sec. V we consider the singular structure of the Green function. In Sec. V A we demonstrate that the Green\nfunction is singular on the null surface, even beyond the boundary of the normal neighbourhood and through caustics.\nWe show that the singular behaviour arises from the large-l asymptotics of the quasinormal mode sums. To investigate\nfurther, we employ two closely-related methods for converting sums into integrals, namely, the Watson transform and\nPoisson sum (Sec. V B). The form of the Green function close to the null cone is studied in detail in Secs. V D and\nV E, and asymptotic expressions are derived.\nSection VI describes the calculation of the self-force for the specific case of the static particle. For the Schwarzschild\nspacetime, the static case has been well-studied. We show in Sec. VI B that the massive-field approach of Rosenthal [40]\nmay be adapted to the Nariai spacetime. This provides an independent check on the matched expansion calculation\nwhich is described in Sec. VI C. Relevant numerical methods are outlined in Sec. VI D.\nIn Sec. VII we present a selection of significant numerical results. We start in Sec. VII A by examining the properties\nof the quasinormal mode Green function. In Sec.

The first two sets of terms are evaluated locally [14, 15, 16].

Its evaluation is the main\nobstacle to progress. The tail integral (2.2) may be split into so-called quasilocal (QL) and distant past (DP) parts,\nas shown in Fig. 1. That is,\n(QL)\n\u03a6tail\n(z(\u03c4 )) + \u03a6(DP)\n(z(\u03c4 ))\n\u03bc (z(\u03c4 )) = \u03a6\u03bc\n\u03bc\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u000f\nZ\n= q lim\n\u2207\u03bc Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 0 ))d\u03c4 0 + q\n\u000f\u21920+\n\n\u03c4 \u2212\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u03c4 \u2212\u2206\u03c4\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2207\u03bc Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 0 ))d\u03c4 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2212 \u2206\u03c4 is the matching time, with \u2206\u03c4 being a free parameter in the method (see Fig. 1).\nThe QL and DP parts may be evaluated separately using independent methods. In particular, if we choose \u2206\u03c4 to\nbe sufficiently small that z(\u03c4 ) and z(\u03c4 \u2212 \u2206\u03c4 ) are within a convex normal neighbourhood [41], then the QL part may be\nevaluated by expressing the Green function in the Hadamard parametrix [42]. In other words, if z(\u03c4 ) and z(\u03c4 \u2212 \u2206\u03c4 )\nare connected by a unique timelike geodesic, then the QL integral is simply\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u000f\nq \u22121 \u03a6(QL)\n(z(\u03c4\n))\n=\n\u2212\nlim\n\u2207\u03bc V (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 0 ))d\u03c4 0\n(2.5)\n\u03bc\n+\n\u000f\u21920\n\n0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212\u2206\u03c4\n\nwhere V (x, x ) is the smooth symmetric biscalar describing the propagation of radiation within the light cone (see\nSec. IV C for full details). The approach ultimately yields a series expansion for the QL self force in the coordinate\n\n\f5\nseparation of the points x and x0 . The Hadamard-expansion method is now well advanced for several spacetimes of\nphysical relevance, such as Schwarzschild and Kerr [43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. In Sec. IV C we apply this method to\ndetermine the quasilocal Green function and self-force in the Nariai spacetime.\nEvaluating the contribution to the Green function from the 'distant past' is a greater challenge, and is the main\nfocus of this work. One possibility is to decompose the Green function into a sum over angular modes and an integral\nover frequency. In a spherically symmetric spacetime the Green function may be defined in terms of an integral\ntransform and mode decomposition as follows,\nZ +\u221e+ic\n\u221e\n0 X\n1\n0\nd\u03c9e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t )\n(2l + 1)Pl (cos \u03b3)g\u0303l\u03c9 (r, r0 )\n(2.6)\nGret (x, x ) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e+ic\nl=0\n\nHere c is a positive constant, t and r are appropriate time and radial coordinates, and cos \u03b3 = cos \u03b8 cos \u03b80 +\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03b80 cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ), where \u03b3 is the angle between the spacetime points x and x0 . The radial Green function\ng\u0303l\u03c9 (r, r0 ) may be constructed from two linearly-independent solutions of a radial equation. Since the DP Green function does not need to be extended to coincidence (\u03c4 0 \u2192 \u03c4 ), the mode sum does not require regularization (though it\nmay still be regularized if desired). However, Anderson and Wiseman [37] found the convergence of the mode sum to\nbe poor, noting that going from 10 modes to 100 increased the accuracy by only a factor of three.\nIn this paper we explore a new method for evaluating the 'distant past' contribution, based on an expansion in socalled quasinormal modes. The integral over frequency in equation (2.6) may be evaluated by deforming the contour in\nthe complex plane [49, 50]. This is shown in Fig. 6. In the Schwarzschild case there arise three distinct contributions\nto the Green function, from the three sections of the frequency integral in (2.6):\n1. A prompt response, arising from the integral along high-frequency arcs.\n2. A 'quasinormal mode sum', arising from the residues of poles in the lower half-plane of complex frequency \u03c9.\n3. Power-law tail, arising from an integral along a branch cut.\n\nThe three parts (1\u20133) are commonly supposed to dominate the scattered signal at early, intermediate and late times,\nrespectively [49, 50]. (This may be slightly misleading, however; Leaver [49] notes that, in addition, the branch cut\nintegral (part 3) \"contributes heavily to the initial burst of radiation\"). In this work, we investigate an alternative\nspacetime, introduced by Nariai in 1950 [38, 39], in which the power-law tail (part 3) is absent. We demonstrate\nthat, on the Nariai spacetime, at suitably 'late times', the distant past Green function may be written as a sum over\nquasinormal modes (defined in Sec. IV B). We use the sum to compute the Green function, the radiative field and\nthe self-force for a static particle.\nThe key question addressed in this work is the following: how much of the self-force arises from the quasilocal\nregion, and how much from the distant past? If the Green function falls off fast enough then only the QL integral\nwould be needed, and, since the QL integral is restricted to the normal neighbourhood, only the Hadamard parametrix\nis required. Unfortunately this is not necessarily the case; Anderson and Wiseman [37] note that there are simple\nsituations in which the DP integral in (2.6) gives the dominant contribution to the self-force.\nUsing the methods presented in this paper we are able to compute the retarded Green function and the integrand\nof Eq. (2.2) as a function of time along the past worldline. We show that the DP contribution cannot be neglected. In\nparticular, we find that the Green function and the integrand of Eq. (2.2) is singular whenever the two points z \u03bc (\u03c4 )\nand z \u03bc (\u03c4 0 ) are connected by a null geodesic. We show that the singular form of the Green function changes every\ntime a null geodesic passes through a caustic. On a spherically-symmetric spacetime, caustics occur at the antipodal\npoints.\nOn Schwarzschild spacetime, the presence of an unstable photon orbit at r = 3M implies that a null geodesic\noriginating on a timelike worldline may later re-intersect the timelike worldline, by orbiting around the black hole.\nHence the effect of caustics may be significant. For example, Fig. 2 shows orbiting null geodesics on the Schwarzschild\nspacetime which intersect timelike circular orbits of various radii. We believe that understanding the singular behaviour of the integrand of Eq. (2.2) is a crucial step in understanding the origin of the non-local part of the self-force.\nAs we shall see, the Nariai spacetime proves a fertile testing ground.\nIII.\n\nSCHWARZSCHILD AND NARIAI SPACETIMES\n\nTo evaluate the retarded Green function (2.6) we require solutions to the homogeneous scalar field equation on the\nappropriate curved background.

The null geodesics are shown as coloured dotted lines, and the timelike circular orbit is shown as a black\nline. The spacetime point x is connected to x1 , x2 , etc. by null geodesics, as well as by the timelike circular geodesic.

Unlike the Schwarzschild potential, the P\u00f6schl-Teller\n(0)\npotential is symmetric about r\u2217 , and decays exponentially in the limit r\u2217 \u2192 \u221e. Yet, like the Schwarzschild potential\nit has single peak, and with appropriate choice of constants, the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential can be made to fit the\nSchwarzschild potential in the vicinity of this peak (see Fig. 3). In the Schwarzschild spacetime, the peak of the\npotential barrier is associated with the unstable photon orbit at r = 3M . As mentioned in the previous section (see\nFig. 2), the photon orbit may lead to singularities in the 'distant past' Green function, and in the integrand of (2.2).\nHence by building a toy model which includes an unstable null orbit, we hope to capture the essential features of the\ndistant past Green function. Authors have found that the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential is a useful model for exploring (some\nof the) properties of the Schwarzschild solution, for example the quasinormal mode frequency spectrum [52, 53]. In\nthis work, we hope to gain some insight into the 'Distant Past' integral on the Schwarzschild spacetime by using the\nexact wavefunctions for the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential, given later in Sec. IV A 1.\nAn obvious question follows: is there a spacetime on which the scalar field equation reduces to a radial wave\nequation with a P\u00f6schl-Teller potential? The answer turns out to be: yes [54, 55]! The relevant spacetime was first\nintroduced by Nariai in 1950 [38, 39].\nTo show the correspondence explicitly, let us define the line element\n2\n\nds2 = \u2212f (\u03c1)dt2N + f \u22121 (\u03c1)d\u03c12 + d\u03a922 ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere f (\u03c1) = 1 \u2212 \u03c1 and \u03c1 \u2208 (\u22121, +1). Line element (3.8) describes the central diamond of the Penrose diagram of\nthe Nariai spacetime (Fig. 4), which is described more fully in Sec. III B. Consider the wave equation (3.1) on this\n(N )\nspacetime. We seek separable solutions of the form \u03a6(x) = ul\u03c9N (\u03c1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)e\u2212i\u03c9N tN , where the label 'N' denotes\n'Nariai'.

Its Penrose diagram differs from that of de Sitter spacetime in that here each point\nrepresents a 2-sphere of constant radius; note also that the corresponding angular coordinate \u03c8 in de Sitter spacetime\nhas a different range, \u03c8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0), as corresponds to its R \u00d7 S3 topology.

The hypersurfaces \u03c8 = 0 and \u03c8 = 2\u03c0 are identified.\nPast/future timelike infinity i\u2212/+ coincides with past/future null infinity I \u2212/+ , and they are all spacelike hypersurfaces. Thus,\n\u00b1\nthere exist observer-dependent past and future cosmological event-horizons, here marked as H\u00b1\nfor an observer along \u03c8 = \u03c0.\n\nbe influentiable/observable by a geodesic observer; the boundary of the future/past of the worldline of the observer\nis its past/future (cosmological) event horizon.\nIn this paper, we consider the static region of the Nariai spacetime which is covered by the coordinates {t, \u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6},\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 a tanh(\u03c1\u2217 /a) \u2208 (\u2212a, +a), \u03c1\u2217 \u2261 (v \u2212u)/2 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e), t \u2261 (v +u)/2 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e) and the null coordinates\n{u, v} are given via U = ae\u2212u/a , V = \u2212aev/a . This coordinate system, {t, \u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6}, covers the diamond-shaped region\nin the Penrose diagram (Fig. 4) around the hypersurface, say, \u03c8 = \u03c0 (because of homogeneity we could choose any\n\u2212\nthe past cosmological event horizon at \u03c1 = \u00b1a of an observer\nother \u03c8 = constant hypersurface). We denote by H\u00b1\n+\nmoving along \u03c8 = \u03c0; similarly, H\u00b1 will denote its future cosmological event horizon at \u03c1 = \u00b1a. Interestingly, Ginsparg\nand Perry [59] showed that this static region is obtained from the Schwarzschild-deSitter black hole spacetime as a\nparticular limiting procedure in which the event and cosmological horizons coincide (see also [60, 61, 62, 63]).\nNote that there are three hypersurfaces \u03c1 = 0, only two of which (those corresponding to \u03c8 = 0 and 2\u03c0) are\nidentified (the one corresponding to \u03c8 = \u03c0 is not). Without loss of generality, we will take \u039b = 1 = a. The\nline-element corresponding to this static coordinate system is given in (3.8).\n\nC.\n\nGeodesics on Nariai spacetime\n\nLet us now consider geodesics on the Nariai spacetime. Our chief motivation is to find the orbiting geodesics, the\nanalogous rays to those shown in Fig. 2 for the Schwarzschild spacetime. We wish to find the coordinate times t \u2212 t0\nfor which two angularly-separated points at the same 'radius', \u03c1, may be connected by a null geodesic. We expect the\nGreen function to be singular at these times t \u2212 t0 .\nWe will assume that particle motion takes place within the central diamond of the Penrose diagram in Fig. 4; that\n+\nis, the region \u22121 < \u03c1 < 1 (notwithstanding the fact that timelike geodesics may pass through the future horizons H+\n+\nand H\u2212\nin finite proper time). Without loss of generality, let us consider motion in the equatorial plane (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2)\ndescribed by the world line z \u03bc (\u03bb) = [t(\u03bb), \u03c1(\u03bb), \u03c0/2, \u03c6(\u03bb)] with tangent vector u\u03bc = [\u1e6b, \u03c1\u0307, 0, \u03c6\u0307], where the overdot\ndenotes differentiation with respect to an affine parameter \u03bb. Symmetry\np implies two constants of motion, k = f (\u03c1)\u1e6b\nand h = \u03c6\u0307. The radial equation is \u03c1\u0307 = \u00b1H(\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c120 )1/2 where \u03c10 = 1 \u2212 k 2 /H 2 is the closest approach point and\nH 2 = h2 + \u03baw2 . Here, w is the scaling of the affine parameter and \u03ba = +1 for timelike geodesics, \u03ba = 0 for null\ngeodesics, and \u03ba = \u22121 for spacelike geodesics. We still have the freedom to rescale the affine parameter, \u03bb, by choosing\na value for w. It is conventional to rescale so that \u03bb corresponds to proper time or distance, that is, set w = 1. Instead,\nwe will rescale so that \u03bb = \u03c6, that is, we set h = 1.\n\n\f10\nLet us consider a geodesic that starts at \u03c1 = \u03c11 , \u03c6 = 0 which returns to 'radius' \u03c1 = \u03c11 after passing through an angle\nof \u2206\u03c6 (N.B. \u2206\u03c6 is unbounded, as opposed to \u03b3 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]). The geodesic distance in this case is s = \u2212\u03ba(H 2 \u2212 1)1/2 \u2206\u03c6.\nIt is straightforward to show that\n\u03c1(\u03c6) = \u03c11\n\ncosh (H\u03c6 \u2212 H\u2206\u03c6/2)\n,\ncosh (H\u2206\u03c6/2)\n\n(3.19)\n\nhence\n\u03c10 = \u03c11 sech(H\u2206\u03c6/2).\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe coordinate time it takes to go from \u03c1 = \u03c11 , \u03c6 = 0 to \u03c1 = \u03c11 , \u03c6 = \u2206\u03c6 is\n!\np\n\u03c11 \u2212 \u03c120 + (1 \u2212 \u03c120 )(\u03c121 \u2212 \u03c120 )\np\n\u2206t1 = 2\u03c1\u22171 + ln\n\u03c11 + \u03c120 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c120 )(\u03c121 \u2212 \u03c120 )\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u22171 = tanh\u22121 (\u03c11 ).

The remaining ingredient in this\nformulation is the one-dimensional (radial) Green function g\u0303l\u03c9 (\u03c1, \u03c10 ) which satisfies\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nd\nU0\n2\n+\n\u03c9\n\u2212\ng\u0303l\u03c9 (\u03c1\u2217 , \u03c10\u2217 ) = \u2212\u03b4(\u03c1\u2217 \u2212 \u03c10\u2217 )\n(4.2)\nd\u03c12\u2217\ncosh2 \u03c1\u2217\nThe radial Green function may be constructed from two linearly-independent solutions of the radial equation (3.11).\nTo ensure a retarded Green function we apply causal boundary conditions: no flux may emerge from the past horizons\nup\n\u2212\n\u2212\nH\u2212\nand H+\n(see Fig. 4).

The\nvalue of the constant \u03be in the conformally-coupled case in a D-dimensional spacetime is: (D \u2212 2)/(4(D \u2212 1)). Note\nthat for conformal coupling in 4-D (\u03be = 1/6) the constant is d = 1/6, and for minimal coupling (\u03be = 0) we have\nd = \u22121/2. For the special value \u03be = 1/8 we have d = 0. The possible significance of the value \u03be = 1/8, the conformal\ncoupling factor in three dimensions, was recently noted in a study of the self-force on wormhole spacetimes [64].\nThe solutions of Eq.

In the Schwarzschild case, the branch cut is\nnecessary due to a branch point in g\u0303l\u03c9 (r, r0 ) at \u03c9 = 0 [49, 66]. In contrast, for the Nariai case with \u03be > 0, the\nWronskian (4.16) is well-defined and non-zero in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0. For minimal coupling (\u03be = 0), we find that \u03c9 = 0\nis a simple pole of the Green function. In either case, \u03c9 = 0 is not a branch point and hence power law decay does\nnot arise on the Nariai spacetime.\nThe simple poles of the Green function (shown as dots in Fig. 6) occur in the lower half-plane of the complex\nfrequency plane. The poles correspond to the zeros of the Wronskian (4.16). The Wronskian is zero when the\n\"in\" and \"up\" solutions are linearly-dependent. This occurs at a discrete set of (complex) Quasinormal Mode (QNM)\nfrequencies \u03c9q . Beyer [67] has shown that, for the P\u00f6schl-Teller potential, the corresponding QNM radial solutions form\na complete basis at sufficiently late times (t > tc , to be defined below). Completeness means that any wavefunction\nobeying the correct boundary conditions at \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e can be represented as a sum over quasinormal modes, to\narbitrary precision. Intuitively, we may expect this to mean that, at sufficiently late times, the Green function itself\ncan be written as a sum over the residues of the poles.\n\n\f13\n(a) Schwarzschild\n\n(b) Nariai\n\nIm(\u03c9)\n\nIm(\u03c9)\n\nRe(\u03c9)\n\nRe(\u03c9)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nFIG. 6: Contour Integrals. These plots show the deformation of the integral over frequency to include the poles of the Green\nfunction (quasinormal modes), for two spacetimes: (a) Schwarzschild [left] and (b) Nariai [right].\n\n1.\n\nQuasinormal Modes\n\nQuasinormal Modes (QNMs) are solutions to the radial wave equation (3.11) which are left-going (e\u2212i\u03c9\u03c1\u2217 ) at\n\u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e and right-going (e+i\u03c9\u03c1\u2217 ) as \u03c1\u2217 \u2192 +\u221e . QNMs occur at discrete complex frequencies \u03c9 = \u03c9q for which\n(in)\nup\nAl\u03c9q = 0. At QNM frequencies, the \"in\" and \"up\" solutions (uin\nl\u03c9q and ul\u03c9q ) are linearly-dependent and the Wronskian\n(4.16) is zero.\nThe QNMs of the Schwarzschild black hole have been studied in much detail [68, 69, 70, 71]. QNM frequencies are\ncomplex, with the real part corresponding to oscillation frequency, and the (negative) imaginary part corresponding\nto damping rate. QNM frequencies \u03c9ln are labelled by two integers: l, the angular momentum, and n = 0, 1, . . . \u221e,\nthe overtone number. For every multipole l, there are an infinite number of overtones. In the asymptotic limit l \u001d n,\nthe Schwarzschild QNM frequencies approach [52, 72, 73]\n1\n(S)\nM \u03c9ln \u2248 \u221a [\u00b1(l + 1/2) \u2212 i(n + 1/2)]\n27\n\n(4.19)\n\nIn general, the damping increases with n. The n = 0 ('fundamental') modes are the least-damped.\n(in)\nThe quasinormal modes of the Nariai spacetime are found from the condition Al\u03c9ln = 0. Using (4.13), we find\n1 + \u03b2 \u2212 i\u03c9ln = \u2212n\n\nor\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 i\u03c9ln = \u2212n\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere n is a non-negative integer. These conditions lead to the QNM frequencies\n\u03c9ln = \u2212\u03bb \u2212 i(n + 1/2),\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere \u03bb is defined in (4.5). (Note we have chosen the sign of the real part of frequency here for consistency with\nprevious studies [52, 53] which use \u03c3 = \u2212\u03c9 as the frequency variable.)\n2.\n\nThe Quasinormal Mode Sum\n\nThe quasinormal mode is constructed from (2.6) by taking the sum over the residues of the poles of g\u0303l\u03c9 (\u03c1, \u03c10 ) in\nthe complex-\u03c9 plane. Applying Leaver's analysis [49] to (2.6), with the radial Green function (4.17), we obtain\n0 0\nGQNM\nret (t, \u03c1; t , \u03c1 ; \u03b3) = 2 Re\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n0\n0\n(2l + 1)Pl (cos \u03b3)Bln \u0169ln (\u03c1)\u0169ln (\u03c10 )e\u2212i\u03c9ln (t\u2212t \u2212\u03c1\u2217 \u2212\u03c1\u2217 )\n\n(4.22)\n\nn=0 l=0\n\nwhere the sum is taken over either the third or fourth quadrant of the frequency plane only. Here, \u03c1 and t are the\ncoordinates in line element (3.8), \u03c1\u2217 is defined in (3.10), \u03c9ln are the QNM frequencies and Bln are the excitation\n\n\f14\nfactors, defined as\n(out)\n\nBln \u2261\n\nAl\u03c9ln\n\n,\n\n(in)\n\n2\u03c9ln\n\ndAl\u03c9\nd\u03c9\n\n(4.23)\n\n\u03c9ln\n\nand \u0169ln (\u03c1) are the QNM radial functions, defined by\n\u0169ln (\u03c1\u2217 ) =\n\nuin\nl\u03c9ln (\u03c1\u2217 )\n\n(out)\n\nAl\u03c9ln ei\u03c9ln \u03c1\u2217\n\n.\n\n(4.24)\n\nThe QNM radial functions are normalised so that \u0169ln (\u03c1) \u2192 1 as \u03c1 \u2192 1 (\u03c1\u2217 \u2192 \u221e).\nThe QNM frequencies have a negative imaginary part; hence the exponentials in (4.22) diverge with n at 'early'\ntimes t \u2212 t0 < tc and tc = \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 . The exponentials converge with n at 'late' times t \u2212 t0 > tc . Beyer [67] has shown\nthat, for late times t \u2212 t0 > tc , QNMs form a complete basis. Physically, for the QNM sum to be appropriate, sufficient\ncoordinate time must elapse for a light ray to propagate inwards from \u03c10 , reflect off the potential barrier near \u03c1 = 0,\nand propagate outwards again to \u03c1.\nThe excitation factors, defined in (4.23), may be shown to be\n1 \u0393(n + 1 \u2212 2i\u03c9ln )\n,\n2 n!

[\u0393(\u2212n + 1/2 + i\u03bb)]2\n\nBln =\n\n(4.25)\n\nThe steps in the derivation are given in Appendix A.3 of [53].\nThe Green function (4.22) now takes the form of a double infinite sum, taken over both angular momentum l and\novertone number n. The convergence of the sum over l is by no means guaranteed. For example, the magnitude of\nBln is proportional to (l + 1/2)n\u22121/2 in the large-l limit, for fixed n. Hence, the magnitude of each term in the series\ngrows with l. Nevertheless, we will show that well-defined and meaningful values can be extracted from the sums.\n3.\n\nGreen Function at Arbitrary 'Radii'\n\nUnfortunately, it is not straightforward to perform the sum over n explicitly for general values of \u03c1 and \u03c10 . Instead\nwe must include the QNM radial functions \u0169ln (\u03c1\u2217 ), defined by (4.7) and (4.24). We note that the Legendre function\nappearing in (4.7) can be expressed in terms of a hypergeometric function (see Eq. (4.6)), and the hypergeometric\nfunction can be written as power series about \u03c1 = 1 (Eq. 4.11). At quasinormal mode frequencies, the second term\nin Eq. (4.11) is zero, and hence the wavefunction is purely outgoing at infinity, as expected. Combining results (4.6),\n(4.7), (4.11) and (4.24) we find the normalised wavefunctions to be\n\u0169ln (\u03c1) =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n1+\u03c1\n\n\u0013i\u03c9ln\n\nSln (\u03c1),\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the radial coordinate in line element (3.8) and Sln is a finite series with n terms,\nSln (\u03c1) =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013k\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\nX\n1 (\u2212n + 2i\u03bb)k (\u2212n)k 1 \u2212 \u03c1\n1\n1\u2212\u03c1\n= 2 F1 \u2212n + 2i\u03bb, \u2212n; \u2212n + + i\u03bb;\n,\nk!

It would be useful to have\na simple approximate expression, with only a single sum, which captures the essence of the physics. At late times,\nwe might expect that the Green function is dominated by the least-damped modes, that is, the n = 0 fundamental\nquasinormal modes. If we discard the higher modes n > 0, we are left with an approximation to the Green function\nwhich does indeed seem to capture the essential features and singularity structure. However, as we show in section\nV D, it does not correctly predict the singularity times.\nThe n = 0 approximation to the Green function is\n(n=0)\nGret (x, x0 )\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u2212T\n\u03c0(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\n\u00131/2 X\n\u221e\nl=0\n\n(2l + 1)Pl (cos \u03b3)\u0393(i\u03bb) i\u03bb[T +ln(1+\u03c1)(1+\u03c10 )]\ne\nSl0 (\u03c1)Sl0 (\u03c10 ).\n\u0393(1/2 + i\u03bb)\n\n(4.34)\n\nNote that the sum over l is approximately periodic in T (exactly periodic in the case \u03be = 1/8), with period 4\u03c0.\nC.\n\nQuasilocal Green Function: Hadamard-WKB Expansion\n\nWe now consider the Green function in the quasilocal region, which is needed for the calculation of the quasilocal\n(QL)\ncontribution to the scalar self-force \u03a6\u03bc\ngiven in Eq. (2.4). When spacetime points x and x0 are sufficiently close\ntogether (within a convex normal neighbourhood ), the retarded Green function may be expressed in the Hadamard\nparametrix [41, 42],\nGret (x, x0 ) = \u03b8\u2212 (x, x0 ) {U (x, x0 ) \u03b4 (\u03c3 (x, x0 )) \u2212 V (x, x0 ) \u03b8 (\u2212\u03c3 (x, x0 ))} ,\n\n(4.35)\n\n\f16\nwhere \u03b8\u2212 (x, x0 ) is analogous to the Heaviside step-function (unity when x0 is in the causal past of x, zero otherwise),\n\u03b4 (\u03c3 (x, x0 )) is the standard Dirac delta function, U (x, x0 ) and V (x, x0 ) are symmetric bi-scalars having the benefit\nthat they are regular for x0 \u2192 x, and \u03c3 (x, x0 ) is the Synge [16, 74, 75] world function. Clearly, the term involving\nU (x, x0 ), the 'direct' part, will not contribute to the quasilocal integral in Eq. (2.4) since it has support only on the\nlight-cone, while the integral is internal to the light-cone. We will therefore only concern ourselves with the calculation\nof the function V (x, x0 ), the 'tail' part, which has support inside the light-cone.\nThe fact that x and x0 are close together suggests that an expansion of V (x, x0 ) in powers of the separation of the\npoints may give a good representation of the function within the quasilocal region. In Ref. [76] we use a WKB method\n(based on that of Refs. [43, 77, 78]) to derive such a coordinate expansion and we also give estimates of its range of\nvalidity. Referring to the results therein, we have V (x, x0 ) as a power series in (t \u2212 t0 ) and (cos \u03b3 \u2212 1),\n0\n\nV (x, x ) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\n2i\n\nj\n\nvij (\u03c1) (t \u2212 t0 ) (cos \u03b3 \u2212 1) ,\n\n(4.36)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the angular separation of the points. In general this expression also includes a third index, k, corresponding\nto the k-th power of the radial separation of the points, (\u03c1\u0002 \u2212 \u03c10 )k . However,\nmotion considered in\n\u0003\n\u0002 for the non-radial\n\u0003\nthe present work, we will only need the terms of order O (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 )0 and O (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 )1 . The k = 0 terms, vij0 = vij ,\nare given by Eq. (4.36) and Ref. [76] and the k = 1 terms, vij1 , are easily calculated from the k = 0 terms using the\nidentity [47]\n1\nvij1 (\u03c1) = \u2212 vij0,\u03c1 (\u03c1).\n2\n\n(4.37)\n\nEq. (4.36) therefore gives the quasilocal contribution to the retarded Green function as required in the present context.\n\nV.\n\nSINGULAR STRUCTURE OF THE GREEN FUNCTION\n\nIn this section we investigate the singular structure of the Green function. We note that one expects the Green\nfunction to be singular when its two argument points are connected by a null geodesic, on account of the 'Propagation\nof Singularities' theorems of Duistermaat and H\u00f6rmander [79, 80] and their application to the Hadamard elementary\nfunction (which is, except for a constant factor, the imaginary part of the Feynman propagator defined below in\nEq.(5.36)) for the Klein-Gordon equation by, e.g., Kay, Radzikowski and Wald [81]: \"if such a distributional bisolution\nis singular for sufficiently nearby pairs of points on a given null geodesic, then it will necessarily remain singular for\nall pairs of points on that null geodesic.\"\nWe begin in Sec. V A by exploring the large-l asymptotics of the quasinormal mode sum expressions (4.33), (4.28)\nand (4.34). The large-l asymptotics of the mode sums are responsible for the singularities in the Green function.\nWe argue that the Green function is singular whenever a 'coherent phase' condition is satisfied. The coherent phase\ncondition is applied to find the times at which the Green function is singular. We show that the 'singularity times'\nare exactly those predicted by the geodesic analysis of Sec. III C. In Sec. V B we introduce two methods for turning\nthe sum over l into an integral. We show in Sec. V C that the Watson transform can be applied to extract meaningful\nvalues from the QNM sums, away from singularities. We show in Sec. V D that the Poisson sum formula may be\napplied to study the behaviour of the Green function near the singularities. We show that there is a four-fold repeating\npattern in the singular structure of the Green function, and use uniform asymptotics to improve our estimates. In\nSec. V E we rederive the same effects by computing the Van Vleck determinant along orbiting geodesics, to find the\n'direct' part of the Green function arising from the Hadamard form. The two approaches are shown to be consistent.\n\nA.\n\nSingularities of the Green function: Large-l Asymptotics\n\nWe expect the Green function Gret (x, x0 ) to be 'singular' if the spacetime points x and x0 are connected by a null\ngeodesic. By 'singular' we mean that Gret (x, x0 ) does not take a finite value, although it may be well-defined in a\ndistributional sense. Here we show that the Green function is 'singular' in this sense if the large-l asymptotics of the\nterms in the sum over l satisfy a coherent phase condition.\n\n\f17\nNear spatial infinity \u03c1, \u03c10 \u2192 +\u221e\n\n1.\n\nInsight into the occurrence of singularities in the Green function may be obtained by examining the large-l asymptotics of the terms in the series (4.33). Let us write\nlim\n0\n\n\u03c1\u2217 ,\u03c1\u2217 \u2192+\u221e\n\n0\nGQNM\nret (x, x ) = Re\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\nGl (T, \u03b3)\n\nThe asymptotic behaviour of the gamma function ratio is straightforward: \u0393(i\u03bb)/\u0393(1/2 + i\u03bb) \u223c \u03bb\u22121/2 e\u2212i\u03c0/4 ,\n+\u221e.

Hence the series is not absolutely\nconvergent. Nevertheless, due to the oscillatory nature of the series, well-defined values can be extracted (see Sec.

In other words, the Green function is 'singular' in our sense if Eq. (5.4) is satisfied.

V D.\nFor the more general case where the spacetime points x, x0 are separated by an angle \u03b3 on the sphere, it is\nstraightforward to use the asymptotics of the Legendre polynomials to show that the Green function (4.33) is singular\nwhen\n\u0002\n\u0003\nT = t \u2212 t0 \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 \u2212 \u03c10\u2217 = ln sinh2 (\u2206\u03c6/2) ,\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0N \u00b1 \u03b3\n(5.7)\nagain in concordance with (3.23).\n\n2.\n\n'Fundamental mode' n = 0\n\nIn Section IV B 5 we suggested that a reasonable approximation to the Green function may be found by neglecting\nthe higher overtones n > 0. The 'fundamental mode' series (4.34) also has singularities arising from the coherent\nphase condition (5.4), but they occur at slightly different times; we find that these times are\nT(n=0) = \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 ln[(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )]\n\nwhere\n\n\u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0N \u00b1 \u03b3.\n\n(5.8)\n\nNote that the singularity times T(n=0) are periodic. Towards spatial infinity, (5.8) simplifies to T(n=0) = \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 2 ln 2,\nwhich should be compared with the 'null geodesic time' given in (3.23). Clearly, the periodic times T(n=0) are not\nquite equal to the geodesic times. Nevertheless, the latter approaches the former as N \u2192 \u221e. In Sec. V D we compare\nthe singularities of the approximation (4.34) with the singularities of the exact solution (4.33) at spatial infinity.\nTo investigate the form of the Green function near, and away from, the null cone, we now introduce two methods\nfor converting a sum over l into an integral in the complex l-plane.\n\n\f18\n\nIm(\u03bd)\nC2\n\nC1\n\n1/2\n\n3/2\n\n5/2\n\n7/2\n\nRe(\u03bd)\n\nFIG. 7: The Watson Transform.

IV B, the distant\u2013past Green function was expressed via a sum over l of the form\nI\u2261\n\n+\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\nF(l + 12 )Pl (cos \u03b3).\n\n(5.9)\n\nHere, F(l + 12 ) may be immediately read off from (4.33), (4.28) and (4.34). The so-called Watson Transform [82]\nand Poisson Sum Formula [83] provide two closely-related ways of transforming a sum over l into an integral in the\ncomplex l-plane. The two methods provide complementary advantages in understanding the sum over l.\nA key element of the Watson transform is that, when extending the Legendre polynomial to non-integer l, the\nfunction with the appropriate behaviour is Pl (\u2212 cos \u03b3). This is obscured by the fact that Pl (\u2212 cos \u03b3) = (\u22121)l Pl (cos \u03b3)\nwhen l is an integer. Our first step is then to rewrite the sum (5.9) as\nI=\n\n+\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\nei(2N +1)\u03c0l F(l + 21 )Pl (\u2212 cos \u03b3),\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere we have also introduced an integer N for later convenience. Using the Watson transform, we may now express\nthe sum (5.9) as a contour integral\nZ\nd\u03bd\n(\u22121)N\nei2N \u03c0\u03bd F(\u03bd)P\u03bd\u22121/2 (\u2212 cos \u03b3)\n,\n(5.11)\nI=\n2i\ncos(\u03c0\u03bd)\nC1\nwhere \u03bd = l + 1/2. The contour C1 starts just below the real axis at \u221e encloses the points \u03bd = 21 , 1 + 12 , 2 + 12 , . . .\nwhich are poles of the integrand and returns to just above the real axis at \u221e. The contour C1 is shown in Fig. 7. If\nthe integrand is exponentially convergent in both quadrants I and IV , the contour may be deformed in the complex-l\nplane onto a contour C2 parallel to the imaginary axis (see Fig. 7). Note that 'Regge' poles are not present inside\nquadrants I and IV in this case.\nTo study the asymptotic behaviour of the Green function near singularities it is convenient to use the alternative\nrespresentation of the sum obtained by writing\n\uf8f1 \u221e\nX\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f42i\nei\u03c0(2l+1)(\u03bd\u22121/2) ,\nIm(\u03bd) > 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n1\nl=0\n=\n(5.12)\n\u221e\n\u22121\nX\nX\ncos(\u03c0\u03bd) \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212i\u03c0(2l+1)(\u03bd\u22121/2)\ni\u03c0(2l+1)(\u03bd\u22121/2)\n\uf8f4\n\u22122i\ne\n=\n\u22122i\ne\n,\nIm(\u03bd)\n<\n0.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nl=0\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\n\f19\nInserting representation (5.12) into (5.11) leads to the Poisson sum formula,\nI=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)s Re\n\ns=\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03bde2\u03c0is\u03bd F(\u03bd)P\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3).\n\n(5.13)\n\nThe Poisson sum formula is applied in Sec. V D to study the form of the singularities.\nC.\n\nWatson Transform: Computing the Series\n\nLet us now show how the Watson transform may be applied to extract well-defined values from sums over l, even\nthough the terms in the series are not absolutely convergent as l \u2192 \u221e. We will illustrate the approach by considering\nthe nth-overtone QNM contribution to the Green function Eq.

We will choose the integer N so that this contour may be deformed into the complex\nplane (as shown in Fig. 7) to a contour on which the integral converges more rapidly. First, we note that the\nLegendre function may be be written as the sum of waves propagating clockwise and counterclockwise, P\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3) =\n(+)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nQ\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3) + Q\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3), where\nQ(\u00b1)\n\u03bc (z)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2i\n=\nP\u03bc (z) \u00b1 Q\u03bc (z)\n2\n\u03c0\n\n(5.15)\n(\u00b1)\n\nand here Q\u03bc (z) is a Legendre function of the second kind. The functions Q\u03bd\u22121/2 have exponential asymptotics in the\nlimit \u03bd\u03b3 \u001d 1,\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n1\n(\u00b1)\ne\u00b1i\u03c0/4 e\u2213i\u03bd\u03b3 .\n(5.16)\nQ\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3) \u223c\n2\u03c0\u03bd sin \u03b3\nWith these asymptotics, and with the large-l asymptotics (5.2) of the hypergeometric functions, one finds that the\ncontour may be rotated to run, for example, along a line Re(\u03bd) = c with c a constant between 0 and 12 provided that\nwe choose\n(\n[(T + log ((\u03c1 + 1)(\u03c10 + 1)) + \u03b3)/(2\u03c0)]\nfor Q(+)\nN=\n(5.17)\n[(T + log ((\u03c1 + 1)(\u03c10 + 1)) + 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3)/(2\u03c0)] for Q(\u2212)\nwhere here [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\nWe performed the integrals along Re(\u03bd) = 41 and found rapid convergence of the integrals except near the critical\ntimes defining the jumps in N given by Eq. (5.17), when the integrands fall to 0 increasingly slowly. An alternative\nmethod for extracting meaningful values from series which are not absolutely convergent is described in Sec. VI D.\nD.\n\nThe Poisson sum formula: Singularities and Asymptotics\n\nIn this section we study the singularity structure of the Green function by applying the Poisson sum formula (5.13).\nThe first step is to group the terms together so that\nZ +\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nI=\nIN\nwhere\nIN \u2261 Re\nd\u03bdF(\u03bd)RN (\u03bd, \u03b3)\n(5.18)\nN =0\n\nand\nRN\n\n0\n\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f2(\u22121)N/2 Q(\u2212) (cos \u03b3)eiN \u03c0\u03bd + Q(+) (cos \u03b3)e\u2212iN \u03c0\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\u22121/2\n\u03bd\u22121/2\nh\ni\n=\n\uf8f3(\u22121)(N +1)/2 Q(+) (cos \u03b3)ei(N +1)\u03c0\u03bd + Q(\u2212) (cos \u03b3)e\u2212i(N +1)\u03c0\u03bd ,\n\u03bd\u22121/2\n\u03bd\u22121/2\n\nN even,\nN odd.\n\n(5.19)\n\n\f20\n(\u00b1)\n\n(\u00b1)\n\nand Q\u03bd\u22121/2 were defined in Eq. (5.15). We can now use the exponential approximations for Q\u03bd\u22121/2 given in (5.16)\nto establish\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\u2212i\u03c0/4 i\u03bd(N \u03c0+\u03b3)\nN/2\n\uf8f2\ne\ne\n+\nc.c.\n,\nN even,\n(\u22121)\n1\nh\ni\n(5.20)\nRN \u223c\n1/2\ni\u03c0/4\ni\u03bd((N\n+1)\u03c0\u2212\u03b3)\n(N\n+1)/2\n\uf8f3(\u22121)\n(2\u03c0\u03bd sin \u03b3)\ne\ne\n+ c.c. ,\nN odd.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the exponential approximations (5.16) are valid in the limit \u03b3\u03bd \u001d 1. Hence the\napproximations are not suitable in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0 case. Below, we use alternative asymptotics (5.28) to investigate\nthis case.\n\n1.\n\n'Fundamental mode' n = 0\n\nLet us apply the method to the 'fundamental mode' QNM series (4.34). In this case we have\nF(\u03bd) =\n\n\u0012\n\n4e\u2212T\n\u03c0(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03bd \u0393(i\u03bb)\nei\u03bb\u03c7\n\u0393(1/2 + i\u03bb)\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhere T was defined in (4.30), \u03bb was defined in (4.5), and\n\u03c7 = T + ln[(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )].\nTaking the asymptotic limit \u03bd \u2192 \u221e we find\nF(\u03bd) \u223c\n\n\u0012\n\n4\u03bd e\u2212T\ni\u03c0(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\n\u00131/2\n\nei\u03bd\u03c7 ,\n\n(5.22)\n\n\u03bd \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(5.23)\n\nNow let us combine this with the 'exponential approximations' (5.20) for RN ,\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\u0012\n\u00131/2 \uf8f2\n(\u22121)N/2 \u2212iei\u03bd(\u03c7+N \u03c0+\u03b3) + ei\u03bd(\u03c7\u2212N \u03c0\u2212\u03b3) ,\n2 e\u2212T\nh\ni\nF(\u03bd)RN (\u03bd, \u03b3) \u223c\n\uf8f3(\u22121)(N +1)/2 ei\u03bd(\u03c7+(N +1)\u03c0\u2212\u03b3) \u2212 iei\u03bd(\u03c7\u2212(N +1)\u03c0+\u03b3) ,\n\u03c0 2 sin \u03b3(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\nN even,\nN odd,\n\n(5.24)\nfor \u03bd \u2192 \u221e. It is clear that the integral in (5.18) will be singular if the phase factor in either term in (5.24) is zero.\nIn other words, each wave RN gives rise to two singularities, occurring at particular 'singularity times'. We are only\ninterested in the singularities for T > 0; hence we may neglect the former terms in (5.24). Now let us note that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\ni\n= i/\u03b6 + \u03c0\u03b4(\u03b6)\n(5.25)\nlim+\nei\u03bd(\u03b6+i\u000f) d\u03bd = lim+\n\u03b6 + i\u000f\n\u000f\u21920\n\u000f\u21920\n0\nUpon substituting (5.24) into (5.18) and performing the integral, we find\n\uf8f1\n(0)\nN/2\n\u00131/2 \uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 \u2212 tN ),\n\uf8f2(\u22121)\n\u2212T\n2e\n(0)\n(\u22121)(N +1)/2\nIN \u223c\n,\n\uf8f4\nsin \u03b3(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\uf8f3\n(0)\n\u03c0(t \u2212 t0 \u2212 tN )\n\nN even,\nN odd,\n\n(5.26)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere IN is IN in (5.18) with F(\u03bd) given by (5.21), and\n(0)\ntN\n\n(0)\n\n= \u03c1\u2217 +\n\n\u03c10\u2217\n\n(\nN \u03c0 + \u03b3,\n\u2212 ln ((1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c1 )) +\n(N + 1)\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3,\n0\n\nN even,\nN odd.\n\n(5.27)\n\nThese times tN are equivalent to the 'periodic' times identified in Sec. V A (Eq. 5.8) and Sec. III C (Eq. 3.24).\nLet us consider the implications of Eq. (5.26) carefully. Let us fix the spatial coordinates \u03c1, \u03c10 and \u03b3 and consider\nvariations in t \u2212 t0 only. Each term IN corresponds to a particular singularity in the mode sum expression (4.34) for\n(0)\n(0)\nthe (n = 0)-Green function. The N th singularity occurs at t \u2212 t0 = tN . For times close to tN , we expect the term IN\nto give the dominant contribution to the (n = 0)-Green function. Eq. (5.26) suggests that the (n = 0)-Green function\n\n\f21\nhas a repeating four-fold singularity structure. The 'shape' of the singularity alternates between a a delta-distribution\n(0)\n(0)\n(\u00b1\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 \u2212 tN ), N even) and a singularity with antisymmetric 'wings' (\u00b11/(t \u2212 t0 \u2212 tN ), N odd).\nThe N th wave may be associated with the N th orbiting null geodesic shown in Fig. 2. Note that 'even N' and\n'odd N' geodesics pass in opposite senses around \u03c1 = 0 (see, for example, Fig. 2). Now, N has a clear geometrical\ninterpretation: it is the number of caustics through which the corresponding geodesic has passed. Caustics are\npoints where neighbouring geodesics are focused, and in a spherically-symmetric spacetime caustics occur whenever\na geodesic passes through angles \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, etc. Equation (5.26) implies that the singularity structure of the\nGreen function changes each time the wavefront passes through a caustic [84].\nMore accurate approximations to the singularity structure may be found by using the uniform asymptotics established by Olver [85] (as an improvement on the 'exponential asymptotics' (5.16)),\n(\u00b1)\nQ\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3)\n\n1\n\u223c\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b3\nsin \u03b3\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(\u2213)\n\nH0 (\u03bd\u03b3),\n\n(5.28)\n\n(\u00b1)\n\nwhere H0 (*) = J0 (*) \u00b1 iY0 (*) are Hankel functions of the first (+) and second (\u2212) kinds. This approximation (5.28)\nis valid in the large-\u03bd limit for angles in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03c0.

The form of the divergence shown in the right plot (\u03b3 = 0) may be understood\nby substituting \u03b3 = 0 into (5.30) to obtain\n(0)\nI1 (\u03b3\n\n= 0) \u223c\n\n2.\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u2212T\n(1 + \u03c1)(1 + \u03c10 )\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c7)\u22123/2 .\n\n(5.33)\n\nNear spatial infinity, \u03c1, \u03c10 \u2192 1\n\nIt is straightforward to repeat the steps in the above analysis for the closed-form Green function (4.33), valid for\n\u03c1, \u03c10 \u2192 1.

VII the asymptotic expressions derived here are compared against numerical results from the mode sums.\n\nWe believe that the 4-fold cycle in the singularity structure of the Green function which we have just unearthed\nusing tricks we picked up from seismology [83] is characteristic of the S2 topology (different types of cycle arising in\ndifferent cases). This cycle may thus also appear in the more astrophysically interesting case of the Schwarzschild\nspacetime. Since this cycle does not seem to be widely known in the field of General Relativity (with the notable\nexception of [84]), in Appendix C we apply the large-l asymptotic analysis of this section to the simplest case with\nS2 topology: the spacetime of T \u00d7 S2 , where the same cycle blossoms in a clear manner.\nE.\n\nHadamard Approximation and the Van Vleck Determinant\n\nIn this section, we rederive the singularity structure found in (5.26) and (5.35) using a 'geometrical' argument based\non the Hadamard form of the Green function. In Sec. IV C we used the Hadamard parametrix of the Green function\nto find the quasilocal contribution to the self-force. Strictly speaking, the Hadamard parametrix of Eq. (4.35), is only\nvalid when x and x0 are within a convex normal neighborhood [41]. Nevertheless, it is plausible (particularly in light of\nthe previous sections) that the Green function near the singularities may be adequately described by a Hadamard-like\nform, but with contributions from all appropriate orbiting geodesics (rather than just the unique timelike geodesic\njoining x and x0 ).\nWe first introduce the Feynman propagator GF (x, x0 ) (see, e.g., [11, 86]) which satisfies the inhomogeneous scalar\nwave equation (2.3). The Hadamard form, which in principle is only valid for points x0 within the normal neighbour-\n\n\f23\nhood of x, for the Feynman propagator in 4-D is [11, 87]\n\u0014\n\u0015\ni U (x, x0 )\n0\n0\n0\n+ V (x, x ) ln(\u03c3 + i\u000f) + W (x, x ) ,\nGF (x, x ) =\n2\u03c0 \u03c3 + i\u000f\n\n(5.36)\n\nwhere U (x, x0 ), V (x, x0 ) (already introduced in Sec.IV C) and W (x, x0 ) are bitensors which are regular at coincidence\n(x \u2192 x0 ) and \u03c3(x, x0 ) is Synge's world function: half the square of the geodesic distance along a specific geodesic\njoining x and x0 . Note the Feynman prescription '\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 + i\u000f' in (5.36), where \u000f is an infinitesimally small positive\nvalue.\nThe retarded Green function is readily obtained from the Feynman propagator by\nGret (x, x0 ) = 2\u03b8\u2212 (x, x0 ) Re (GF (x, x0 )) ,\n\n(5.37)\n\nwhich yields (4.35) inside the convex normal neighbourhood, since U (x, x0 ), V (x, x0 ) and W (x, x0 ) are real-valued\nthere. We posit that the 'direct' part of the Green function remains in Hadamard form,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1\nU (x, x0 )\ni\ndir.\n0\n0\nGret (x, x ) = lim+ Re i\n= Re U (x, x ) \u03b4(\u03c3) +\n,\n(5.38)\n\u03c3 + i\u000f\n\u03c0\u03c3\n\u000f\u21920 \u03c0\neven outside the convex normal neighbourhood [note that outside the convex normal neighbourhood we still use the\nterm 'direct' part to refer to the contribution from the U (x, x0 ) term, even if its support may not be restricted on\nthe null cone anymore]. It is plausible that the Green function near the N th singularity (see previous section) is\ndominated by the 'direct' Green function (5.38) calculated along geodesics near the N th orbiting null geodesic. To\ntest this assertion, we will calculate the structure and magnitude of the singularities and compare with (5.35).\nIn four dimensional spacetimes, the symmetric bitensor U (x, x0 ) is given by\nU (x, x0 ) = \u22061/2 (x, x0 ),\n\n(5.39)\n\nwhere \u2206(x, x0 ) is the Van Vleck determinant [88, 89, 90]. The Van Vleck determinant can be found by integrating a\nsystem of transport equations along the appropriate geodesic joining x and x0 . The first of these [16],\n\u03bb\n\nd ln \u2206\n= 4 \u2212 \u03c3\u03b1 \u03b1\nd\u03bb\n\n(5.40)\n\nis a transport equation for the Van Vleck determinant itself, with the initial condition \u2206(\u03bb = 0) = 1. Here, \u03bb is an\naffine parameter along the geodesic joining x and x0 , and \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03b2 = \u2207\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1 \u03c3 is the second covariant derivative (taken with\nrespect to spacetime point x) of Synge's world function, which in turn is found from the coupled system of transport\nequations [57, 91]\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03c3 \u03b1 \u03b2\n= \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03bc \u03c3 \u03bc \u03b2 + \u03bbu\u03bc (\u0393\u03bd \u03b2\u03bc \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bc \u03c3 \u03bd \u03b2 ) \u2212 \u03bb2 R\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b2\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd\nd\u03bb\n\n(5.41)\n\nand the boundary condition \u03c3 \u03b1 \u03b2 (\u03bb = 0) = \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 .\nIn principle, transport equations (5.40) and (5.41) may be integrated numerically to determine the Van Vleck\ndeterminant along any given geodesic on any given spacetime. This is the approach that we might take on, for\nexample, in Schwarzschild. A numerical approach is not necessary for the Nariai spacetime, however. This spacetime\nis the Cartesian product of a two-sphere with a 2-D de Sitter spacetime. On a product spacetime M = M1 \u00d7 M2 we\nmay make the following decomposition:\n\u03c3 = \u03c31 + \u03c32 ,\n\n\u2206 = \u22061 \u22062 ,\n\n(5.42)\n\nwhere \u03c3i and \u2206i (i = 1, 2) are, respectively, Synge's world function and the Van Vleck determinant on the manifold\nMi . It will be shown in a forthcoming work [92] that the Van Vleck determinant on the Nariai spacetime when the\ntwo points x and x0 are within the normal neighbourhood is simply\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b7\n\u03b3\n0\n\u2206(x, x ) =\n(5.43)\nsin \u03b3\nsinh \u03b7\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 [0, \u03c0) is the geodesic distance traversed on the two-sphere and \u03b7 is the geodesic distance traversed in the\ntwo-dimensional de Sitter subspace. Hence the Van Vleck determinant is singular at the angle \u03b3 = \u03c0.\n\n\f24\nThis may be seen another way. Using the spherical symmetry, let us assume without loss of generality that the\nmotion is in the plane \u03c6 = const, from which it follows that the equation for \u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6 in (5.41) decouples from the\nremainder; it is\nd\u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6\n(5.44)\n+ \u03b82 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6 (1 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6 ) = 0\nd\u03b8\nHere we have rescaled the affine parameter \u03bb to be equal to the angle \u03b8 subtended by the geodesic. Note that here\nwe let \u03b8 take values greater than \u03c0. It is straightforward to show that the solution of Eq. (5.44) is \u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6 = \u03b8 cot \u03b8.\nHence \u03c3 \u03c6 \u03c6 is singular at the angles \u03b8 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, 3\u03c0, etc. In other words, the Van Vleck determinant is singular at\nthe antipodal points, where neighbouring geodesics are focused: the caustics. The Van Vleck determinant may be\nseparated in the following manner: \u2206 = \u2206\u03c6 \u2206ty , where\n\u03b8\n\nd ln \u2206\u03c6\n= 1 \u2212 \u03c3\u03c6 \u03c6 ,\nd\u03b8\nd ln \u2206ty\n\u03b8\n= 2 \u2212 \u03c3t t \u2212 \u03c3y y .\nd\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\n(5.45)\n(5.46)\n\nEq. (5.45) yields\nln \u2206\u03c6 = ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b80\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8\n\nd\u03b80 cot \u03b80\n\n(5.47)\n\n\u03b80\n\nwhich can be integrated analytically by following a Landau contour in the complex \u03b80 -plane around the (simple) poles\nof the integrand (located at \u03b80 = k\u03c0, k \u2208 Z), which are the caustic points. Following the Feynman prescription\n'\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 + i\u000f', we choose the Landau contour so that the poles lie below the contour. We then obtain (setting \u03b80 = 0\nwithout loss of generality)\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n\n\u03b8\ne\u2212iN \u03c0 .\nsin \u03b8\n\n(5.48)\n\nHere, N is the number of caustic points the geodesic has passed through. The phase factor, obtained by continuing\nthe contour of integration past the singularities at \u03b8 = \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc., is crucial. Inserting the phase factor e\u2212iN \u03c0/2 in\n(5.38) leads to exactly the four-fold singularity structure predicted by the large-l asymptotics of the mode sum (5.35).\nThat is:\n\uf8f1\n\u0012\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u00131/2 \uf8f2(\u22121)N/2 \u03b4(\u03c3),\nN even,\n\u03b7\n\u03b8\n(N \u22121)/2\nGdir\n(5.49)\n(\u22121)\nN \u223c\n\uf8f3\nsinh \u03b7\nsin \u03b8\n,\nN odd.\n\u03c0\u03c3\nThe accumulation of a phase of '\u2212i' on passing through a caustic, and the alternating singularity structure which\nresults, is well-known to researchers in other fields involving wave propagation \u2013 for example, in acoustics [93],\nseismology [83], symplectic geometry [94] and quantum mechanics [95] the integer N is known as the Maslov index [96,\n97].\nWe would expect to find an analogous effect in, for example, the Schwarzschild spacetime. The four-fold structure\nhas been noted before by at least one researcher [84]. Nevertheless, the effect of caustics on wave propagation in\nfour-dimensional spacetimes does not seem to have received much attention in the gravitational literature (see [98, 99]\nfor exceptions).\nTo compare the singularities in the mode-sum expression (5.35) with the singularities in the Hadamard form (5.49),\nlet us consider the 'odd-n' singularities of 1/\u03c3 form. We will rearrange (5.35) into analogous form by expanding \u03c3 to\n(\u221e)\n(\u221e)\nfirst-order in t \u2212 tN , where tN is the N th singularity time for orbiting geodesics starting and finishing at \u03c1 \u2192 1.\nFor the orbiting geodesics described in Sec. III C we have \u03c3 = \u2212 12 (H 2 \u2212 1)\u03b82 . At \u03c1 \u2192 1, expanding to first order and\nusing (3.23) yields\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(\u221e)\n\u03c3 \u223c \u2212(H\u03b8) tanh(H\u03b8/2) t \u2212 tN\n.\n(5.50)\nThe mode-sum expression (5.35) may then be rewritten in analogous form to the 'N odd' expression in (5.49),\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n1/2\n1/2\nH\u03b7 sinh(\u03b7/2)\n\u03b8\n1/2\n(n\u22121)/2 \u2206(QNM)\nGQNM\n\u223c\n(\u22121)\nwhere\n\u2206\n=\n.\n(5.51)\n(QNM)\nret\n\u03c0\u03c3\nsin \u03b8\n2 cosh3 (\u03b7/2)\n\nHere \u03b7 = H\u03b8, where H is the constant of motion introduced in Sec. III C. We find very good agreement between\n(5.43) and (5.51) in the \u03b8 & \u03c0 regime. The disagreement at small angles is not unexpected as the QNM sum is invalid\nat early times (or equivalently, for orbiting geodesics which have passed through small angles \u03b8).\n\n\f25\nVI.\n\nSELF-FORCE ON THE STATIC PARTICLE\n\nIn this section we turn our attention to a simple case: the self-force acting on a static scalar particle in the Nariai\nspacetime. By 'static' we mean a particle with constant spatial coordinates. It is not necessarily at rest, since its\nworldline may not be a geodesic, and it may require an external force to keep it static. In Sec. VI A we review previous\ncalculations for the static self-force on a range of spacetimes and in Sec. VI B we explore one such analytic method for\ncomputing the static self-force in Nariai spacetime. This method, based on the massive field approach of Rosenthal\n[40] provides an independent check on the matched-expansion approach. In Sec. VI C we describe how the method\nof matched expansions may be applied to the static case. To compute the self-force, we require robust numerical\nmethods for evaluating the quasinormal mode sums such as (4.28); two such methods are outlined in Sec. VI D. The\nresults of all methods are validated and compared in Sec. VII.\n\nA.\n\nThe Static Particle\n\nA static particle \u2013 a particle with constant spatial coordinates \u2013 has been the focus of several scalar self-force\ncalculations, in particular for the Schwarzschild spacetime [37, 40, 47, 100, 101, 102, 103]. Although it may not be\na particularly physical case, it is frequently chosen because it involves relatively straightforward calculations and has\nan exact solution for the Schwarzschild spacetime. It therefore provides a good testing ground for new approaches to\nthe calculation of the self-force.\nSmith and Will [101] calculated the self-force on a static electric charge in the Schwarzschild background and found\nit to be non-zero. In [100], Wiseman considered the analogous case of a static scalar charge in the case of minimalcoupling (i.e., \u03be = 0) in Schwarzschild. Using isotropic coordinates, he managed to sum the Hadamard series for the\nGreen function in the static case (i.e., the \"Helmholtz\"-like equation in Schwarzschild with zero-frequency, \u03c9 = 0)\nand thus obtain in closed form the field created by the static charge in the scalar and also electrostatic (already found\nin [104, 105] using a different method) cases. He then found the self-force to be zero in the scalar, minimally-coupled\ncase.\nIn [103], the calculation of the self-force on a static scalar charge in Schwarzschild is extended to the case of\nnon-minimal coupling (\u03be 6= 0) and is found to be zero as well. The fact that the value of the scalar self-force in\nSchwarzschild is the same (zero) independently of the value of the coupling constant is in agreement with the QuinnWald axioms [14, 15]: their method relies only on the field equations, and these are independent of the coupling\nconstant in a Ricci-flat spacetime such as Schwarzschild. The calculation (without using the Quinn-Wald axioms) is\nby no means trivial, however, since the effect of the coupling constant might be felt through the stress-energy tensor\n(in fact, [103] corrected a previous result in [106, 107], where the self-force had been incorrectly found to be non-zero).\nRosenthal [40] has also considered this case of a static particle in Schwarzschild and used it as an example application\nof the massive field approach [108] to self-force calculations.\nOn the other hand, Hobbs [109] showed that, in a conformally-flat spacetime, the \"tail\" contribution to the self-force\non an electric charge (on any motion, static or not) is zero. The only possible contribution to the self-force might\nthen come from the local Ricci-terms, which are zero in cases of physical interest such as in de Sitter universe.\nNoting the conformal-invariance of Maxwell's equations, one would then expect the \"tail\" contribution to the scalar\nself-force to also be zero in the two following cases: (1) for a charge undergoing any motion in a conformally-flat 4-D\nspacetime with conformal-coupling (i.e., \u03be = 1/6), and (2) for a static charge (where the time-independence effectively\nreduces the problem to a 3-D spatial one), in a spacetime such that its 3-D spatial section is conformally-flat and\nwith conformal-coupling in 3-D (i.e., \u03be = 1/8). Indeed, in a recent article [110] it was shown that the scalar self-force\non a massless static particle in a wormhole spacetime (with non-zero Ricci scalar and where the 3-D spatial section is\nconformally-flat) changes sign at \u03be = 1/8 and it is equal to zero at this 3-D conformal value.\nThe Nariai spacetime, not being Ricci-flat and being conformal to a wormhole spacetime (and so with conformallyflat 3-D spatial section), suggests a very interesting playground for calculating the self-force: What role does the\ncoupling constant \u03be play? Do particular values such as \u03be = 1/6 (4-D conformal-coupling) and \u03be = 1/8 (3-D conformalcoupling, so a particular value in the case of a static charge) yield particular values for the self-force? Do they support\nthe Quinn-Wald axioms?\n\nB.\n\nStatic Green Function Approach\n\nThe conventional approach to calculating the self-force on a static particle due to Wiseman [100] uses the\n'scalarstatic' Green function. Following Copson[104], Wiseman was able to obtain this Green function by summing the Hadamard series. Only by performing the full sum was he able to verify that his Green function satisfied\n\n\f26\nthe appropriate boundary conditions. Linet [111] has classified all spacetimes in which the scalarstatic equation is\nsolvable by the Copson ansatz and the Nariai metric does not fall into any of the classes given. Therefore, instead\nwe work with the mode form for the static Green function. This corresponds to the integrand at \u03c9 = 0 of Eq. (4.18)\n(with integral measure d\u03c9\n2\u03c0 ),\nGstatic (\u03c1, \u03a9; \u03c10 , \u03a90 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c0P\u22121/2+i\u03bb (\u2212\u03c1< )P\u22121/2+i\u03bb (\u03c1> )\n(2l + 1)Pl (cos \u03b3)\n2 cosh(\u03c0\u03bb)\n\n(6.1)\n\nl=0\n\nq\n(l + 21 )2 + d. This equation, having only one infinite series, is amenable to numerical\nwhere, as before, \u03bb =\ncomputation.\nTo regularise the self-force we follow the method of Rosenthal [40], who used a massive field approach to calculate\nthe static self-force in Schwarzschild. Following his prescription, we calculate the derivative of the scalar field and of\na massive scalar field. In the limit of the field mass going to infinity, we obtain the derivative of the radiative field\nwhich is regular.

II, we outlined the method of matched expansions. In this subsection, we show how to apply the method\nto a specific case: the computation of the self-force on a static particle in the Nariai spacetime.\nThe four velocity of the static particle is simply\nu\u03c1 = u\u03b8 = u\u03c6 = 0,\n\nut = (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )\u22121/2\n\n(6.12)\n\nand hence d\u03c4 0 = (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )1/2 dt0 . We find from Eqs. (1.4), (1.5) and (2.1) that mat = ma\u03b8 = ma\u03c6 = 0 and\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u000f\n1 \u03c1\n\u03c1\n2\n\u03c1\u03c1\n0\n0\nma = q\n\u0227 + lim+\ng \u2202\u03c1 Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 ))d\u03c4\n3\n\u000f\u21920\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u000f\n\u0001\u22121/2\n1\ndm\n= \u2212q 2\n(1 \u2212 6\u03be)R + 1 \u2212 \u03c12\nlim+\n\u2202t Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 0 ))d\u03c4 0\nd\u03c4\n12\n\u000f\u21920\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(6.13)\n(6.14)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03bc denotes partial differentiation with respect to the coordinate x\u03bc . We note that in the tail integral of the\nmass loss equation, (6.14), the time derivative \u2202t may be replaced with \u2212\u2202t0 since the retarded Green function is a\nfunction of (t \u2212 t0 ). Hence we obtain a total integral,\nZ \u03c4 \u2212\u000f\nZ t\u2212\u000f\n\u0001\n2 \u22121/2\n0\n0\n1\u2212\u03c1\nlim+\n\u2202t Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 ))d\u03c4 = \u2212 lim+\n\u2202t0 Gret (z(\u03c4 ), z(\u03c4 0 ))dt0\n\u000f\u21920\n\n\u000f\u21920\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nt0 =t\u2212\u000f\n\n= \u2212 lim+ [Gret (x, x0 )]t0 =\u2212\u221e\n\u000f\u21920\n\n(6.15)\n\nThe total integral depends only on the values of the Green function at the present time and in the infinite past\n(t0 \u2192 \u221e). The QNM sum expressions for the Green function (e.g. Eq. (4.33)) are zero in the infinite past, as the\nquasinormal modes decay exponentially. The value of the Green function at coincidence (t0 \u2192 t) is found from the\n1\n(1 \u2212 6\u03be)R, which exactly cancels\ncoincidence limit of the function \u2212V (x, x0 ) in the Hadamard form (4.35). It is 12\nthe local contribution in the mass loss equation (6.14). It is no surprise to find that this cancellation occurs \u2013 the\nR\nlocal terms were originally derived from the coincidence limit of the Green function. In fact, because d\u03a6\nd\u03c4 = 0 due\nto time-translation invariance, we can see directly from the original equation (1.5) that the mass loss is zero in the\nstatic case.\nNow let us consider the radial acceleration (6.13). The acceleration keeping the particle in a static position is\nconstant (\u0227\u03c1 = 0). The remaining tail integral may be split into two parts,\n!\nZ\nZ\nt\u2212\u000f\n\nma\u03c1 = q 2 (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )3/2\n\n\u2212 lim+\n\u000f\u21920\n\n\u2202\u03c1 V (z(t), z(t0 ))dt0 +\n\nt\u2212\u2206t\n\n\u2202\u03c1 Gret (z(t), z(t0 ))dt0\n\n(6.16)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nt\u2212\u2206t\n\nFor the first part of (6.16), we use the quasilocal calculation of V (x, x0 ) from Sec. IV C. As V (x, x0 ) is given as a\npower series in (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 ) and (t \u2212 t0 ), the derivatives and integrals can be done termwise and are straightforward. The\nquasilocal integral contribution is therefore simply\nZ t\u2212\u000f\n\u221e\n1X\n1\nlim\n\u2202\u03c1 V (z(t), z(t0 ))dt0 =\n\u03b4\u03c1 vk0 (\u2206t)2k+1 .\n(6.17)\n\u000f\u21920 t\u2212\u2206t\n2\n(2k + 1)!\nk=0\n\n\f28\nThe second part of (6.16) can be computed using the QNM sum (4.28). To illustrate the approach, let us rewrite\n(4.28) as\nX\n0\n0\n0\nGQNM\nGln (\u03c10 )e\u2212i\u03c9ln (t\u2212t \u2212\u03c1\u2217 \u2212\u03c1\u2217 ) \u0169ln (\u03c1).\n(6.18)\nret (\u03c1, t; \u03c1 , t; ) = Re\nln\n\nApplying the derivative with respect to \u03c1 and taking the integral with respect to t0 leads to\nZ\n\nt\u2212\u2206t\n\n\u2202\u03c1 Gret (z(t), z(t0 ))dt0 =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\u2217\n\n\u0013\u22121 Z\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c12\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\nt\u2212\u2206t\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\u2202t0 GQNM\nret dt + Re\n\nt0 =t\u2212\u2206t\n\n[Gret ]\n\n+\n\nX iGln\nln\n\n\u03c9ln\n\nXZ\nln\n\nt\u2212\u2206t\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\n0\n\nGln e\u2212i\u03c9ln (t\u2212t \u2212\u03c1\u2217 \u2212\u03c1\u2217 )\n0\n\ne\u2212i\u03c9ln (\u2206t\u2212\u03c1\u2217 \u2212\u03c1\u2217 )\n\nd\u0169ln\nd\u03c1\n\nd\u0169ln 0\ndt\nd\u03c1\n(6.19)\n\nIt is straightforward to find the derivative of the radial wavefunction from the definition (4.26). In Sec. VI D we\noutline two methods for numerically computing mode sums such as (6.19).\nThe self-force computed via (6.16), (6.17) and (6.19) should be independent of the choice of the matching time (we\nverify this in Sec. VII D). This invariance provides a useful test of the validity of our matched expansions. Additionally,\nthrough varying \u2206\u03c4 we may estimate the numerical error in the self-force result.\n\nD.\n\nNumerical Methods for Computing Mode Sums\n\nThe static-self-force calculation requires the numerical calculation of mode sums like (6.19). We used two methods\nfor robust numerical calculations: (1) 'smoothed sum', and (2) Watson transform (described previously in Sec. V C).\nWe see in Sec. VII that the results of the two methods are consistent.\nThe 'smoothed sum' method is straightforward to describe and implement. Let us suppose that we wish to extract\na numerical value from an infinite sum\n\u221e\nX\n\nal\n\n(6.20)\n\nl=0\n\nwhich may not be absolutely convergent (i.e. |al+1 /al | \u2265 1). We may instead compute the finite sum\nS(lcut ) =\n\nl\u221e\nX\n\nal e\u2212l\n\n2\n\n2\n/2lcut\n\n(6.21)\n\nl=0\n\nwhere l\u221e is large enough to suppress any high-l oscillations in the result (typically l\u221e > 4lcut ). We find that (6.21)\nis a good approximation to (6.20) provided we are not within \u03b4t \u223c 1/lcut of a singularity of the Green function.\nIncreasing the cutoff lcut therefore improves the resolution of the singularities.\nVII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe now present a selection of results from our numerical calculations. In Sec. VII A the distant past Green function\nis examined. We plot the Green function as a function of coordinate time t \u2212 t0 for fixed spatial points. A four-fold\nsingularity structure is observed. In Sec. VII B we test the asymptotic approximations of the singular structure,\nderived in Secs. V E and V D (Eqs. 5.35 and 5.49). We show that the 'fundamental mode' (n = 0) series (4.34) is\na good approximation of the exact result (4.33), if a 'time-offset' correction is applied. In Sec. VII C the quasilocal\nand distant past expansions for the Green function are compared and matched. We show that the two methods for\nfinding the Green function are in excellent agreement for a range of matching times \u2206\u03c4 . In Sec. VII D we consider\nthe special case of the static particle. We present the Green function, the radiative field and the self-force in turn.\nThe radial self-force acting on the static particle is computed via the matched expansion method (described in Secs.\nII and VI C), and plotted as a function of coordinate \u03c1, and compared with the result derived in Sec. VI B.\n\n\f29\n0.4\n\n\"=0\n0.3\n\n# = 1/6\n\n'Distant Past' Green Function\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n10\nT = t - t' - !* - !*'\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nFIG. 9: Distant Past Green Function for spatially-coincident points near infinity (\u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 1, \u03b3 = 0). The Green function was\ncalculated from mode sum (4.33) numerically using the smoothed sum method (6.21) with lcut = 200 and curvature coupling\nfactor \u03be = 1/6.\n\nA.\n\nThe Green Function Near Infinity from Quasinormal Mode Sums\n\nLet us begin by looking at the Green function for fixed points near spatial infinity, \u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 1 (i.e. \u03c1\u2217 = \u03c10\u2217 \u2192\n+\u221e). The Green function may be computed numerically by applying either the Watson transform (Sec. V C) or the\n'smoothed sum' method (Sec. VI D) to the QNM sum (4.33).\nFigure 9 shows the Green function for fixed spatially-coincident points near infinity (\u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 1, \u03b3 = 0). The Green\nfunction has been calculated from series (4.33) using the 'smoothed sum' method. It is plotted as a function of QNM\ntime, T = t \u2212 t0 \u2212 (\u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 ). We see that singularities occur at the times (3.23) predicted by the geodesic analysis\nof Sec. III C. In this case, TC = ln[sinh2 (N \u03c0)] \u2248 4.893, 11.180, 17.463, etc. At times prior to the first singularity at\nT \u2248 4.893, the Green function shows a smooth power-law rise. At the singularity itself, there is a feature resembling\na delta-distribution, with a negative sign. Immediately after the singularity the Green function falls close to zero\n(although there does appear a small 'tail'). This behaviour is even more marked in the case \u03be = 1/8 (not shown). A\nsimilar pattern is found close to the second singularity at T \u2248 11.180, but here the Green function takes the opposite\nsign, and its amplitude is smaller.\nFigure 10 shows the Green function for points near infinity (\u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 1) separated by an angle of \u03b3 = \u03c0/2. The Green\nfunction shown here is computed from the 'fundamental mode' approximation (4.34), again using the 'smoothed sum'\nmethod. In this case, the singularities occur at 'periodic' times (3.24), given by T = \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 2 ln 2 \u2248 0.1845, 3.326, 6.468,\netc., where \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2, 5\u03c0/2, . . .. As discussed, there is a one-to-one correspondence between singularities and\norbiting null geodesics, and the four-fold singularity pattern predicted in Sec. V D (5.49) and Sec. V E (5.35) is clearly\nvisible. Every 'even' singularity takes the form of a delta distribution. Numerically, the delta distribution is manifest\nas a Gaussian-like spike whose width (height) decreases (increases) as lcut is increased. By contrast (for \u03b3 6= 0, \u03c0),\nevery 'odd' singularity diverges as 1/(T \u2212 Tc ); it has antisymmetric wings on either side. The singularity amplitude\ndiminishes as T increases.\nB.\n\nAsymptotics and Singular Structure\n\nThe analyses of Sec. V D and Sec. V E yielded approximations for the singularity structure of the Green function.\nIn particular, Eq. (5.35) gives an estimate for the amplitude of the 'odd' singularities as \u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 \u221e. We tested our\nnumerical computations against these predictions. Figure 11 shows the Green function near the singularity associated\nwith the null geodesic passing through an angle \u2206\u03c6 = 3\u03c0/2. The left plot compares the numerically-determined Green\nfunction (4.34) with the asymptotic prediction (5.35). The right plot shows the same data on a log-log plot. The\nasymptotic prediction (5.35) is a straight line with gradient \u22121, and it is clear that the numerical data is in excellent\nagreement.\n\n\f30\n0.4\n\n\" = 1/6\n0.3\n\n# = $/2\n\nDistant Past Green Function\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n8\nT = t - t' - !* - !*'\n\n10\n\n12\n\n15\n\n2.5\n\n10\n\n2\n\n5\n\n1.5\n\nlog10|GF|\n\nGreen's Function (GF)\n\nFIG. 10: Distant Past Green Function near spatial infinity (\u03c1 = \u03c10 \u2192 1) for points separated by angle \u03b3 = \u03c0/2.

The 'fundamental mode' (n = 0) Green function (4.34) (with lcut = 2500) is compared with approximations (5.35) and\n(5.49) from considering high-l asymptotics. The approximations give Gret \u223c \u22120.04268/(T \u2212 Tc ) and Gret \u223c \u22120.04344/(T \u2212 Tc ),\nrespectively.

These asymptotics are valid all the way up to \u03b3 = 0. Figure 12 compares the asymptotic expressions\n(5.30) and (5.31)(solid line) with numerical computations (broken lines) from the mode sum (4.34). It is clear that\nthe asymptotics (5.30) and (5.31) are in excellent agreement with the numerically-determined Green function. Closest\nagreement is found near the singular times, but the asymptotics provide a remarkably good fit over a range of t.\nIn Fig. 13, the 'fundamental mode' (n = 0) approximation (4.34) is compared with the exact QNM Green function\n(4.33). Away from singularities, the former is found to be a good approximation to the latter. However, close to\nsingularities this is not the case. The singularities of the 'fundamental mode' approximation (4.34) occur at slightly\ndifferent times to the singularities of the exact solution (4.33), as discussed in Sec. V A. For the fundamental mode\nN\nseries (4.34), the singularity times Treg\ngiven in Eq. (5.8) are periodic.

This is clearly shown in the lower plot\nof Fig. 13. Comparing the series (4.34) and (4.33) we see that, in both cases, the magnitude of the terms in the series\nincreases as (l + 1/2)1/2 in the large-l limit. This observation raises the possibility that the n = 0 modes may give the\nessential features of the full solution; if true, this would certainly aid the analysis of the Schwarzschild case, where it\nis probably not feasible to perform a sum over n analytically.\n\nC.\n\nMatched Expansions: Quasilocal and Distant Past\n\nLet us now turn our attention to the match between quasilocal and distant past Green functions. The quasilocal\nexpansion (4.36) is valid within the convergence radius of the series, t \u2212 t0 < tQL , while the QNM sum is convergent at\n'late' times, t \u2212 t0 > \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 . Hence, a matched expansion method will only be practical if the quasilocal and distant\npast Green functions overlap in an intermediate regime \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 < t \u2212 t0 < tQL . It is expected that the convergence\nradius of the quasilocal series, tQL , will lie within the normal neighbourhood, tN N , of spacetime point x. The size\nof the normal neighborhood is limited by the earliest time at which spacetime points x and x0 may be connected by\nmore than one non-spacelike geodesic. Typically this will happen when a null geodesic has orbited once, taking a\ntime tN N > \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 , so we can be optimistic that an intermediate regime will exist. To test this idea, we computed\nthe quasilocal Green function using (4.36), and the distant past Green function (4.28) for a range of situations.\nFigure 14 shows the retarded Green function as a function of coordinate time t\u2212t0 for a static particle at \u03c1 = \u03c10 = 0.5.\nAt early times, the quasilocal Green function is well-defined, but the distant past Green function is not. Conversely,\nat late times the quasilocal series is not convergent. At intermediate times 1.099 < \u2206t . 3.45, we find an excellent\nmatch. Figure 14 also shows that the results of the two numerical methods for evaluating QNM sums are equivalent.\nThat is, the Green function found from the Watson transform (Sec. V C, red line) coincides with the Green function\ncalculated by the method of smoothed sums (Sec. VI D, black dots).\nLet us now examine the matching procedure in more detail. Figure 15 shows the match between the distant past\nand quasilocal Green functions, computed from (4.28) and (4.36), in the case \u03c1 = \u03c10 = 0.5. In Fig. 15, the left plot\nshows the case for conformal coupling \u03be = 1/6 and the right plot shows the case for \u03be = 1/8. Note that Green function\n1\ntends to the constant value 12\n(1 \u2212 6\u03be)R in the limit \u2206t \u2192 0+ . In both cases, we find that the fit between 'quasilocal'\nand 'distant past' Green functions is good up to nearly the radius of convergence of the quasilocal series.\nFigure 16 quantifies the accuracy of the match between quasilocal and distant past Green functions.

Note the logarithmic scale on the\nvertical axis. It is clear that the matching error is reduced by increasing nmax and lcut , and that the best agreement is found\nclose to the radius of convergence of the quasilocal series (at T \u223c 1.9). The plot shows that matching accuracy of above one\npart in 104 is achievable.\n\nused the 'smoothed sum' method (Sec. VI D) to compute the distant past Green function from (4.28).

As expected, better accuracy is obtained by increasing lcut and\nnmax , although the run time for the code increases commensurately. With care, a relative accuracy of one part in 104\nto 105 is possible. This accuracy is sufficient for confidence in the self-force values computed via matched expansions,\npresented in Sec.

This may be interpreted as the portion of radiative field generated by\nthe segment of the static-particle worldline between t0 = \u2212\u221e and t0 = t \u2212 \u2206t. Here \u2206t = T + \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 , where T is the time\ncoordinate shown on the horizontal axis.\n\nD.\n\nThe Self-Force on a Static Particle\n\nIn this section, we present a selection of results for a specific case: a 'static' particle at fixed spatial coordinates.\nOur goal is to compute the self-force as a function of \u03c1, to demonstrate the first practical application of the PoissonWiseman-Anderson method of matched expansions [36, 37].\nThe radiative field may be found by integrating the Green function with respect to \u03c4 0 , where d\u03c4 0 = (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )1/2 dt0 .\nIntegrating a mode sum like (4.34) with respect to t0 is straightforward; we simply multiply each term in the sum by\na factor 1/(i\u03c9ln ). Hence it is straightforward to compute a partial field defined by\nZ\n\u00011/2 t\u2212\u2206t\n\u03a6partial (\u2206t) = q 1 \u2212 \u03c12\nGret (t \u2212 t0 , \u03c1 = \u03c10 , \u03b3 = 0)dt0 .\n(7.1)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis may be interpreted as \"the field generated by the segment of the static-particle world line lying between t0 = \u2212\u221e\nand t0 = t \u2212 \u2206t\". In the limit \u2206t \u2192 0, the partial field \u03a6partial will coincide with the radiative field \u03a6R . An example\nof this calculation is shown in Fig. 17. Here, q \u22121 \u03a6partial is plotted as a function of T = \u2206t \u2212 \u03c1\u2217 \u2212 \u03c10\u2217 for a static\nparticle near spatial infinity, \u03c1 \u2192 1. We have used the method of smoothed sums (Sec. VI D), with lcut = 200. The\n'partial field' \u03a6partial shares singular points with Gret . Figure 17 shows that a significant amount of the total radiative\nfield arises from the segment of the worldline after the first singularity. The Green function tends to zero in the limit\n\u2206t \u2192 0 (for \u03be = 1/6). On the other hand, the partial field tends to a constant non-zero value in this limit. The\nconstant value is the radiative field q \u22121 \u03a6R .\nAn accurate value for the total radiative field is found by using the quasilocal Green function to extend \u03a6partial\nto coincidence, \u2206t \u2192 0+ . The method is illustrated in Fig. 18 (left plot). The dashed line shows the quasilocal\ncontribution to the radiative field, and the dotted line shows the distant past contribution to the radiative field, as\na function of matching time. The former is the result of integrating from the matching point \u03c4 \u2212 \u2206\u03c4 to coincidence,\nand the latter from integrating from \u2212\u221e to the matching point. Here, \u2206\u03c4 varies linearly with the x-axis scale T (see\ncaption). The right plot illustrates the same calculation for the radial self-force. Here, the dotted line representing\nthe contribution from the distant past is found from the sum (6.19).\nFigure 19 shows the total radiative field \u03a6R generated by a static particle in the Nariai spacetime. The field is\nplotted as a function of \u03c1, for two cases: \u03be = 1/6 and \u03be = 1/8. In the former case, the field is negative. In the latter\ncase, the field is positive, and about two orders of magnitude greater in amplitude. In both cases, the amplitude of\nthe field is maximal at \u03c1 = 0 and tends to zero as \u03c1 \u2192 1 as \u03a6R \u223c (1 \u2212 \u03c12 )1/2 .\nFigure 20 shows the self-force ma\u03c1 acting on a static particle. The results of the matched expansion results are\nshown as points, and the results of the 'massive field regularization method' (described in Sec. VI B) are shown as the\nsolid line.

We find the self-force at \u03c1 = 0 to be zero, as expected\nfrom the symmetry of the spacetime. The self-force also tends to zero as \u03c1 \u2192 1. Between these limits, the self-force\nrises to a single peak, the magnitude and location of which depends on the curvature coupling \u03be. We find that the\npeak of the self-force is approximately 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 for \u03be = 1/6 and approximately 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 for \u03be = 1/8.\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented the first practical demonstration of a self-force calculation using the method of\nmatched expansions. The matched expansions method was first proposed over a decade ago by Poisson and Wiseman\n[36]. We have shown that the 'quasilocal' expansion in coordinate separation [43, 46, 47, 48], valid only in the\nnormal neighbourhood, may be accurately matched onto a mode sum expansion, valid in the distant past. Through\nmatching the 'quasilocal' and 'distant past' expansions, the full retarded Green function may be reconstructed.

The radial component of the self-force, q \u22122 ma\u03c1 , is plotted as a function\nof the \u03c1 of the static particle. The self-force was calculated by two methods: 'matched expansion' (black dots) and 'massive\nfield regularization' (blue curve). The left plot shows the curvature coupling \u03be = 1/6 whereas the right plot shows \u03be = 1/8.\nNote the difference in scales for the two cases.\n\nfull knowledge of the Green function, one may accurately compute the 'tail' contribution to the self-force. In this\nwork, we employed the matching method to numerically compute the self-force acting on a static particle, and showed\nthat the resulting self-force is in excellent agreement with the result from an alternative method (Sec. VI B), to\napproximately one part in 106 .\nThe key new ingredient in our formulation is the so-called 'quasinormal mode sum' expansion for the distant past\nGreen function. Following Leaver's approach [49], the integral over frequency in the mode sum expansion of the Green\nfunction (4.1) may be performed by deforming the contour of integration in the complex frequency plane. Poles of the\nGreen function arise at (complex) quasinormal mode frequencies in the lower half-plane. The sum over the residues\nof the poles gives the quasinormal mode sum \u2013 a key contribution to the Green function (see below).\nThe QNM sum is only valid at 'late times', t \u2212 t0 \u2265 tc , where tc is approximately the time it takes for a geodesic\nto reflect from the peak of the potential barrier. We have demonstrated that there is a sufficient regime of overlap in\nt \u2212 t0 in which both the 'quasilocal' and 'QNM sum' expansions are valid for the method to be applied successfully.\nThe QNM spectra of black holes have received much attention in the last three decades. In some studies [52, 53, 114],\n(S)\napproximations to QNM frequencies are found by replacing the effective potential Vl (3.5) with the so-called P\u00f6schlTeller potential (3.7). The advantage of this replacement is that the QNMs and radial solutions of the P\u00f6schl-Teller\npotential are known in closed form. In this paper, we have taken the idea a step further. We have shown that\nthe P\u00f6schl-Teller potential arises naturally if we consider the radial equation resulting from waves on an alternative\nspacetime: the product spacetime dS2 \u00d7 S2 , first introduced by Nariai [38, 39] in 1950. This is an Einstein spacetime\nof constant scalar curvature.\nThe symmetry of Nariai spacetime undoubtedly makes calculations easier. For example, geodesic motion may be\nseparated into motion on the two submanifolds, dS2 and S2 ; the Van Vleck determinant may be written in closed form\n(5.43); and the decay rate of the quasinormal modes is independent of l. We view the Nariai spacetime as an excellent\ntesting ground for our methods. Nevertheless, we should not forget the overall goal of the Poisson-Wiseman-Anderson\nproposal [36, 37]: accurate matched-expansions calculations on physical black hole spacetimes. Below, we review some\nof the insights provided by our 'experiment' with the Nariai spacetime which will help any future calculations.\nAt late times t \u2212 t0 > \u03c1\u2217 + \u03c10\u2217 it has been previously been established [67] that the quasinormal modes provide\na complete basis on the Nariai spacetime. Here, we demonstrated that, at late times, the QNM sum (4.22) fully\ndescribes the retarded Green function. This is not expected to be the case on the Schwarzschild spacetime [49]. In the\nlatter case, there arises a branch point at \u03c9 = 0 and a branch cut in the frequency integral which gives a 'power-law\ntail' contribution [50] to the Green function (Fig. 6). The branch point is notably absent for the Nariai spacetime,\nmaking the analysis simpler. In this paper we have thoroughly investigated the effect of the quasinormal modes. The\ncontribution of the branch cut integral to the self-force remains to be quantified. We hope to pursue this calculation\nin a forthcoming work.\nThis study has provided a number of insights into the properties of the Green function, which are of relevance to\nany future investigation of the Schwarzschild spacetime. Namely,\n\u2022 The Green function Gret (x, x0 ) is singular whenever x and x0 are connected by a null geodesic. The nature of the\nsingularity depends on the number of caustics that the wave front has passed through. After an even number\nof caustics, the singularity is a delta-distribution, with support only on the light cone. After an odd number\n\n\f37\nof caustics, the Green function diverges as 1/\u03c0\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the Synge world function. A four-fold repeating\npattern occurs, i.e. \u03b4, 1/\u03c0\u03c3, \u2212\u03b4, \u22121/\u03c0\u03c3, \u03b4, etc.\n\u2022 The four-fold singular structure can be shown to arise from a Hadamard-like ansatz (5.38) valid even outside\nthe normal neighborhood, if we allow U (x, x0 ) to pick up a phase of \u2212i upon passing through a caustic. The\naccumulation of phase may be deduced by analytically continuing the integral for the Van Vleck determinant\nthrough the singularities (due to caustics).\n\u2022 Hadamard's form for the Green function (4.35) is only strictly valid if x and x0 are in a convex normal neighbourhood [41]. The extension beyond the normal neighbourhood does not seem to be known. However, this work\nand some previous studies [115] would tentatively suggest that, if x and x0 are connected by a countable number\nof distinct geodesics, then the Green function may be found from the sum of their Hadamard contributions.\n\u2022 The effect of caustics on wave propagation has been well-studied in a number of other fields, such as optics [116],\nacoustics [93], seismology [83], symplectic geometry [94] and quantum mechanics [95]. It may be that mathematical results developed in other fields may be usefully applied to wave propagation in gravitational physics.\nA further observation made in this work is confirmation that the 'tail' self-force cannot be calculated from the\n'quasilocal' contribution alone. For instance, Fig. 17 would appear to show that a significant part of the radiative\nfield is generated by the segment of the world line which lies outside of the normal neighbourhood (i.e. beyond the\nfirst caustic). Unlike in flat space, the radiated field generated by an accelerated particle may propagate once, twice,\netc. around the black hole before later re-intersecting the world-line of the particle (see Fig. 2). Radiation from near\nthese orbits will give an important contribution to the self-force which cannot be neglected.\nLet us conclude by examining the prospects for a practical 'matched expansions' calculation on the Schwarzschild\nspacetime. Happily, the 'quasilocal' expansion is now in excellent shape, as described in [47]; the challenge remains\nthe 'distant past' expansion. We have already mentioned that a quasinormal mode sum will not be sufficient; it must\nbe augmented by a branch cut integral. We have reasons to be optimistic that this is a tractable calculation [50].\nPerhaps more difficult will be the accurate numerical computation of QNM frequencies and radial functions. A further\ndifficulty will be in integrating the mode sum over the worldline; for accuracy we wish to avoid numerical integration if\npossible. For the static particle, it was straightforward to integrate each term in the mode sum analytically (Sec. VI C)\nwith respect to time. For other trajectories (e.g. circular orbits) this may present more of a challenge. Finally, we note\nthat a range of established results are available on Schwarzschild. For the static particle the self-force is zero [100, 117];\nfor radial trajectories and circular and eccentric orbits, accurate numerical results are available [26, 29, 102, 118].\nThis will surely help the validation of the 'matched expansions' method. We hope to undertake such a study in the\nnear future.\nIX.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to thank Leor Barack, Vitor Cardoso, Oscar Dias and Brien Nolan for interesting and helpful\ndiscussions.

Our starting point is expression (5.29) for the 'n=0' fundamental modes, in which the\n(\u00b1)\nLegendre polynomials Pl (cos \u03b3) have been replaced by angular waves Q\u03bd\u22121/2 (cos \u03b3) which are, in turn, approximated\n(\u2213)\n\nby Hankel functions H0 (\u03bd\u03b3) using (5.28).\nLet us consider the I1 and I2 integrals arising from substituting (5.29) into (5.18). These integrals are singular at\n\u03c7 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c7 = 2\u03c0 + \u03b3, respectively. First, let us consider I1 (5.18) which can be written\nZ \u221e\n(+)\nI1 \u2248 \u2212A(\u03b3)Re\nd\u03bd(\u2212i\u03bd)1/2 ei(\u03c7\u22122\u03c0)\u03bd H0 (\u03bd\u03b3)\n(B1)\n0\n\nwith A(\u03b3) as defined in Eq.

V has not been\nshown before in the literature (with the exception of [84]) within the theory of General Relativity. We therefore wish\nto illustrate its derivation and manifestation in the simplest of spacetimes including S2 -topology:\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + d\u03a922 ,\n\n(C1)\n\n\u0001\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nwhere Synge's world function is simply given by \u03c3 =\n\u2212\u2206t2 + \u2206\u03c6 , in the case of a conformally-coupled (\u03be = 1/8)\nscalar field.\nLet x = (t, \u03b8, \u03c6) denote any point in this spacetime. We introduce the Wightman function G+ (x, x0 ) (it satisfies\nthe homogeneous scalar wave equation - see, e.g., [86]), from which the 'retarded' Green function Gret (x, x0 ) is easily\nobtained:\nG+ (x, x0 ) =\n\n+\u221e X\n+l\nX\n\n\u03a6lm (x)\u03a6\u2217lm (x0 ) =\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\n+\u221e\n1 X \u2212i(l+1/2)\u2206t\ne\nPl (cos \u03b3),\n4\u03c0\n\n(C2)\n\nl=0\n\nGret (x, x0 ) = \u22122\u03b8(\u2206t) Im (G+ (x, x0 )) ,\n(C3)\np\nwhere \u2206t \u2261 t \u2212 t0 , \u03a6lm (x) = e\u2212i(l+1/2)t Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)/ (2l + 1) are the Fourier-decomposed scalar field modes on (C1)\nnormalized with respect to the scalar product\nZ\n(\u03a6lm , \u03a6l0 m0 ) = \u2212i\ndV n\u03bc [\u03a6lm (x)\u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u2217l0 m0 (x) \u2212 \u03a6\u2217l0 m0 (x)\u2202\u03bc \u03a6lm (x)] = \u03b4ll0 \u03b4mm0 ,\n(C4)\n\u03a3\n\nwhere \u03a3 is a Cauchy hypersurface with future-directed unit normal vector n\u03bc and volume element dV .\nWe now apply exactly the same tricks as in section V D in order to derive the four-fold singularity structure in the\nGreen function from the large-l asymptotics of the field modes.

Note, however, that I\u00b1 (T, \u03b3) is regular at X = \u22131.\nWe then have that the singular behaviour goes as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n+I+ (\u2206t, \u03b3),\n0 < \u2206t < \u03c0, \u03b3 \u223c 0\n\uf8f4\nr\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n1\n\u039e\n\u2212iI+ (\u2206t \u2212 \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3), \u03c0 < \u2206t < 2\u03c0, \u03b3 \u223c \u03c0\n4\u03c0G+ (x, x0 ) \u223c\n(C15)\n2 sin \u039e \uf8f4\n\u2212I+ (\u2206t \u2212 2\u03c0, \u03b3),\n2\u03c0 < \u2206t < 3\u03c0, \u03b3 \u223c 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n+iI+ (\u2206t \u2212 3\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3), 3\u03c0 < \u2206t < 4\u03c0, \u03b3 \u223c \u03c0\nThe 4-fold singularity structure arises clearly: a phase of \u03c0/2 is picked up everytime the null geodesic joining\nx0 goes through a caustic (\u03b3 = 0 or \u03c0).\nThe expression for G+ (x, x0 ) is simplified by noting that, \"near\" \u03b3 = 0:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nN +1\n0\n4\u03c0 GN\n(x, x0 ) \u223c\n+ (x, x ) + G+\n\"\n#\nr\n\u03b3\n1\n1\nN\np\ni\n+p\n, N even\nsin \u03b3\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 (\u2206t \u2212 N \u03c0 \u2212 i\u000f)2\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 (\u2206t + N \u03c0 \u2212 i\u000f)2\n\"\n#\nr\n\u03c0\u2212\u03b3\n1\n1\nN\np\ni\n, N odd.\n+p\nsin(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3)\n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3)2 \u2212 (\u2206t \u2212 N \u03c0 \u2212 i\u000f)2\n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3)2 \u2212 (\u2206t + N \u03c0 \u2212 i\u000f)2\n\nx and\n\n(C16)\n(C17)\n\n(C18)\n\nSimilarly \"near\" \u03b3 = \u03c0. The Poisson sum formula has yielded a sum over geodesic paths, labelled by the index N ,\nand the large-order asymptotics for the Legendre functions have yielded the correct singularity structure near the null\n\n\f41\ngeodesics, allowing for the correct phase change at each caustic.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]\n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\n[54]\n[55]\n\nhttp://www.ligo.caltech.edu.\nhttp://www.virgo.infn.it.\nhttp://geo600.aei.mpg.de.\nhttp://lisa.nasa.gov.\nT.
