For about three decades, their exact nature remained elusive. The effort to provide a fast re-pointing of\nthe BeppoSAX satellite allowed for the first detection of\ntheir afterglows at all wavelengths (e.g. Costa et al. 1997;\nvan Paradijs et al. 1997). Since then, the specification of\neach generation of instrumentation devoted to GRB studies\nincluded the need to point to the GRB afterglows quickly.\nNow, with Swift, we have reached the point where we can\ncollect data from X-rays to optical within seconds after the\nstart of the event, thanks to fast moving telescopes triggered by GCN notices (Barthelmy 1998). This run toward\nfast re-pointing has allowed for prompt optical emission ob-\n\n\u22c6\n\nPresent address : ASDC, Via Galileo Galilei, 00044 Frascati,\nItaly. E-mail:bruce.gendre@asdc.asi.it. Based on observations obtained with TAROT, REM, GROND.\n\nservations by small autonomous telescopes for several GRBs\n(e.g. Klotz et al. 2009c).\nSince the mid of the 1990's, a theoretical canonical model has emerged in order to explain the GRB\nphenomenon: the fireball model (Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1992;\nM\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees 1997; Panaitescu et al. 1998). This model\nis based on blast waves emitted by a progenitor during\nblack hole formation, that interacts within a jet and/or with\nthe surrounding medium to produce all observed emissions.\nThese emissions are not thermal, and are proposed to be synchrotron emission from the electrons accelerated within the\nfireball. This model has the advantages that it is quite easy\nto apply and reproduces, reasonably well, the observations\ndone by BeppoSAX and other telescopes (e.g. Gendre et al.\n2006). The situation has, however, radically changed with\nthe launch of the Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004). Swift\nhas discovered X-ray flares (O'Brien et al. 2006), an early\nflattening of the X-ray emission (Nousek et al. 2006), and\nseveral chromatic breaks within the afterglow light curves\n(e.g. Racusin et al. 2008), that were unexpected within the\n\n\f2\n\nB. Gendre et al.\n\ninitial standard model. This model has been modified in\norder to explain all these new features, including late energy injection (e.g. Ghisellini et al. 2007), multi-core or\npatchy jets (e.g. Peng et al. 2005, and references therein),\nand multi-component afterglow (e.g. Willingale et al. 2007).\nHowever, these modifications to the standard model were\nmade only in order to explain a given feature, and sometimes lack a multi-wavelength consistency check. In previous\nyears, several studies on peculiar events have led the realization that all available data could not be explained due\nto limitations within the standard model (e.g. Klotz et al.\n2008).\nIn this article, we present observations of GRB 090102\nat optical and X-ray wavelengths, taken over the 10 days\nfollowing the burst. While the optical or X-ray data alone\ncould be explained within the framework of the standard\nmodel, when combining these different datasets, the standard model alone cannot explain the observations of this\nburst, indicating that other models need to be tested. The\npaper is organized as follows: we present GRB 090102 in\nSec. 2 with the data reduction and analysis in Sec. 3; we\nfit several models to these data in Sec. 4; finally, we discuss\nour findings in Sec. 5 before concluding. Errors on spectral and temporal indices (and the related closure relation\nvalues) are quoted at the 90% confidence level throughout.\nReported errors on data points are 1\u03c3 errors.\n\n2\n\nGRB 090102\n\nGRB 090102 triggered Swift-BAT (trigger 338895,\nMangano et al. 2009a) on Jan. 2009, 2nd at 02:55:45\nUT (hereafter, T0 ). It was also recorded by Konus Wind\n(Golenetskii et al. 2009), and by INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS\n(Mangano et al. 2009b). The duration of this event,\nas observed by Swift was T90 = 27.0 \u00b1 2.2 s. Its light\ncurve presents four peaks from T0 \u2212 14 s to T0 + 15 s\n(Sakamoto et al. 2009). Its time averaged spectrum can be\nrepresented either using an exponential cutoff power law\nmodel or a Band model (Band et al. 1993), with parameters \u03b1 = \u22120.86 \u00b1 0.14, \u03b2 6 \u22122.73, and Ep = 451+73\n\u221258 keV\n\u22125\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 1.075, 64 d.o.f.) and with a fluence of 3.09+0.29\n\u22120.25 \u00d710\n\u22122\nerg cm (20 keV \u2013 2 MeV, Golenetskii et al. 2009). Using\nthe measured redshift (z=1.547, de Ugarte Postigo et al.\n2009a), this gives Eiso \u223c 5.75 \u00d7 1053 erg (1 keV \u2013 10 MeV,\nrest frame) and a rest frame Ep of 1149+186\n\u2212148 keV, fully\ncompatible with the so-called Amati relation (Amati et al.\n2009, 2002).\nDue to an observational constraint (Earth limb too\nclose), Swift slewed to the position of the afterglow with\na delay, and XRT and UVOT observations began only at\nT0 + 395 s, observing a bright fading source in both the\nXRT and the UVOT fields of view (Mangano et al. 2009a).\nNo optical observations were available during the prompt\nphase. The earliest ground search of the optical afterglow\nwas performed by the Telescope a Action Rapide pour\nles Objets Transitoires (TAROT), starting at T0 +40.8 s\n(Klotz et al. 2009a). The Rapid Eye Mount (REM) robotic\ntelescope also observed the field starting from T0 +53 s\n(Covino et al. 2009, note however that the start time reported in the GCN is not correct). A new source was detected at RA=08h 32m 58.52s , Dec=+33\u25e6 06\u2032 51.1\u2032\u2032 (J2000.0)\n\nFigure 1. Image of the field of view of GRB 090102 from\nGROND, taken in the i' band 11 ks after the burst. The GRB\nafterglow is indicated by two ticks.\n\nwith an error of 0.3\u2032\u2032 (see Fig. 1). This source was then confirmed to be the optical afterglow of GRB 090102. Spectroscopic observations were carried by the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2009a), the Palomar\n200\" Hale telescope (Cenko et al. 2009), and by the HobbyEberly Telescope (Cucchiara & Fox 2009).\nLate afterglow observations were performed by\nthe Gamma-Ray burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector\n(GROND) 2.50 h after the burst (Afonso et al. 2009), by the\nInstituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de Canarias 80 cm telescope (IAC80)\n19.2 h after the burst (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2009b), and\nby the Palomar 60-inch telescope 50 min after the burst and\nlater on (Cenko et al. 2009). The observations continued in\nthe following days using the NOT (Malesani et al. 2009) and\nthe HST (Levan et al. 2009), leading to the detection of the\nhost galaxy.\nA radio follow-up was also carried out using the VLA\nand the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT)\nat the 8.46 GHz (Chandra & Frail 2009) and the 4.9 GHz\n(van der Horst et al. 2009) wavelengths respectively. No afterglow was detected, leading to upper limits. Finally, the\nMAGIC Cerenkov Telescope also pointed to the position of\nthe afterglow, without any detection (Gaug et al. 2009).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS\nX-ray data\n\nThe data were processed using the ftools version 6.6.2. To\nextract light curves and spectra, a rectangular box and circular extraction region were used for window timing and\nphoton counting modes respectively, with an extraction region of 50 pixels in both cases.

When not plotted, the error bars have the size of the symbols or smaller. These light curves have been corrected\nfor the galactic extinction/absorption due to the Milky Way. The X-ray light curve is extracted in the 0.5 to 10.0 keV band. The dotted\nline is the best fit decay law (see text for details). The left axis applies to optical/infrared data, the right axis to X-ray data.\n\nswitched to the photon counting mode (see Hill et al. 2005)\nat T0 + 669.1 s, while the count rate was high enough to\ncause pile up. As a matter of consequence, the observation\nbetween T0 +669.1 s and \u223c T0 +3000 s suffers from severe to\nmoderate pile up. This area was discarded in the following\nspectral analysis, and corrected within the light curve using\nthe prescriptions of Vaughan et al. (2006).\nAll spectra were rebinned in order to include 20 net\ncounts within each bin, and fit using the \u03c72 statistic. The\nspectral model was composed of a power law continuum\nabsorbed by our own galaxy (NH = 4.1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nDickey & Lockman 1990) and by the host galaxy at z =\n1.547. Extracting spectra at several epoch, we did not find\nany evidence for spectral variation during the whole followup of the afterglow. The spectrum is well modeled (\u03c72\u03bd =\n0.92, 102 d.o.f.) by a single power law with spectral index\n\n\u03b2X = 0.83 \u00b1 0.09 absorbed in our own galaxy and by extra21\ngalactic absorbers (NH = 8.8+2.7\ncm\u22122 when located\n\u22122.5 \u00d7 10\nwithin the host galaxy).\nThe light curve was extracted within the 0.5-10.0 keV\nband and rebinned in order to obtain at least 25 counts\nper bin. All decay index indicated below are derived from\nfits using the \u03c72 statistic. We did not observe strong flares\n(see Fig. 2). A single moderate flare can be seen in the unbinned light curve during orbit 2 (corresponding to the period \u223c 2000 \u2212 4000s after the trigger), which has been excluded from the temporal analysis. The complete light curve\ncan be adequately fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.18, 65 d.o.f.) using a single\npower law with a decay index \u03b1X = 1.34 \u00b1 0.02. A broken power law can also represent the data (\u03c72\u03bd = 0.99, 63\nd.o.f.) with \u03b11,X = 1.29 \u00b1 0.03, \u03b12,X = 1.48 \u00b1 0.10, and\na break time tb = 18700+14500\n\u22128000 s. With the observed steep-\n\n\f4\n\nB. Gendre et al.\n\nening, \u2206\u03b1 = 0.19 \u00b1 0.11, this break could be interpreted\nas the cooling frequency passing through the observation\nband. However, this should be associated with a spectral\nbreak not supported by the data. An F-test check on the\nbreak existence gives a probability of 0.26, i.e. a value not\nconclusive. One may note however that in this special case\n(large error on tb that make it compatible with 0 within\n3\u03c3), the probability derived from the F-test should not be\nconsidered as valid (see Protassov et al. 2002). As a matter of consequence, in the following we will consider both\nhypotheses (single power law or broken power law), and report early and late X-ray data as data taken before and after\nthe temporal break respectively.\n3.2\n\nOptical data\n\nAt the position of the afterglow, the Galactic extinction is E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.047 according to Schlegel et al.\n(1998). We corrected all magnitudes using this estimation. Assuming Rv =3.1, this gives in particular AR =0.14\n(Pei 1992). The specific data processing relative to all instruments is indicated in the following subsections. We\ncompleted this sample by using reported observations\nby Cenko et al. (2009); de Ugarte Postigo et al. (2009b);\nMalesani et al. (2009). This extended sample of data taken\nin the R band is listed in Table 1.\n3.2.1\n\nTAROT data\n\nWe used data from TAROT Calern (Klotz et al. 2009d) that\nstarted an exposure of the field of GRB 090102 at T0 +40.8 s\n(duration 60 s) with the tracking speed adapted to obtain a\nsmall ten pixel trail. This technique was used in order to obtain continuous temporal information during the exposure\n(e.g. Klotz et al. 2006). The spatial sampling was 3.29\u2032\u2032 pix\u22121\nand the FWHM of stars (in the perpendicular direction of\nthe trail) was 2.05 pixels. Only the first exposure was performed with this technique. Successive images were tracked\non the diurnal motion using exposure times increasing from\n30 s to 180 s. Images are not filtered.\nWe used the star USNO-B1 1231-0206902 as a constant\ntemplate for calibration during the trailed exposure. Contrary to the claim of Klotz et al. (2009a), TAROT did not\nobserve a rise during the first part of the trailed image. Indeed, the profile is convolved by the Point Spread Function\n(PSF) that induces a slope at the start and at the end of\nthe trail. The rapid analysis done by Klotz et al. (2009a)\nconfused this slope with a rise at the start of the GRB afterglow trail. This has been corrected for by using the flux\nof the template (constant) star.\nIn order to precisely cross-calibrate the observations\nperformed with REM and TAROT, we used several USNO\nstars as relative standards. All flux measurements were done\nusing standard aperture photometry with the AuDela software1 . USNO-B1 1231-0206902 has been used to build the\nPSF in TAROT images in order to fit the flux of the GRB.\nTAROT observations are not filtered. We thus converted\nall TAROT instrumental magnitudes to standard R magnitudes, using the following formula: R= C \u2212 2.5 \u00d7 log(F ) +\n\n(V \u2212 R) \u00d7 \u03b1r . In this equation, \u03b1r = 0.4 is determined using\ncalibration stars with various (V-R) values located within an\nopen cluster. C is calculated for each image from the PSF\nflux, the R and (V-R) measurements of the reference stars.\n3.2.2\n\nEarly time optical and NIR data were collected using the 60\ncm robotic telescope REM (Zerbi et al. 2001; Covino et al.\n2004) located at the ESO La Silla observatory (Chile). The\ntelescope simultaneously feeds, by means of a dichroic, the\ntwo focal instruments: REMIR (Conconi et al. 2004) a NIR\ncamera, operating in the range 1.0-2.3 \u03bcm (z', J, H and K),\nand ROSS (REM Optical Slitless Spectrograph, Tosti et al.\n2004) an optical imager with spectroscopic (slitless) and\nphotometric capabilities (V, R, I). Both cameras have a field\nof view of 10 \u00d7 10 \u2032 .\nREM reacted promptly and began observing 103 s after\nthe GRB trigger time, following the event for \u223c1 hour (see\nTable 1). For the first 500 s REMIR observations were performed only in the H filter with increasing exposure times,\nthen all the NIR filters were used in sequence. In the optical range only R band images were taken, for a total of 38\nconsecutive images. The transient was only detected up to\n500 s both in the R and H bands, after which its luminosity\nfalls below the instrument detection limits for all filters.\nEach single NIR observation with REMIR was performed with a dithering sequence of five images shifted by a\nfew arcseconds. These images are automatically elaborated\nusing the proprietary routine AQuA (Testa et al. 2004). The\nscript aligns the images and co-adds all the frames to obtain\none average image for each sequence.\nEach R image was reduced using standard procedures. A combination of the ESO-MIDAS2 DAOPHOT task\n(Stetson 1988) and Sextractor3 package (Bertin & Arnouts\n1996) was used to perform standard aperture photometry.\nThe photometric calibration for the NIR was accomplished\nby applying average magnitude shifts computed using the\n2MASS4 catalogue.\nThe optical data were calibrated using instrumental\nzero points and checked with observations of standard stars\nin the SA92 Landolt field (Landolt 1992). Results are displayed in Tables 1 and 2.\n3.2.3\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.audela.org/\n\nGROND data\n\nThe Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/NearInfrared Detector\n(GROND, Greiner et al. 2008) mounted at the 2.2 m\nESO/MPI telescope at La Silla observatory imaged the\nfield of GRB 090102 simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK starting\n9.01 ks after T0 under clear sky conditions (Afonso et al.\n2009). At that point the location of the burst was becoming\nvisible above the pointing horizon of the telescope. A total\nof 12 g'r'i'z' images with integration times of 66 s, 115 s and\n375 s were obtained during the first night post burst. At the\nsame time, NIR frames were acquired with a constant exposure of 10 s. In addition, the field was observed by GROND\n2\n\n1\n\nREM data\n\n4\n\nhttp://www.eso.org/projects/esomidas/\nhttp://astroa.physics.metu.edu.tr/MANUALS/sextractor/\nhttp://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/\n\n\fMulti-wavelength observations of GRB 090102\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

Data reduction was performed using standard IRAF tasks (Tody 1993), similar to\nthe procedure outlined in Kruehler et al. (2008). Absolute\nphotometry of the afterglow was measured relative to field\nstars from the SDSS and 2MASS catalogs, which yields average accuracies of 0.04 mag in g'r'i'z' and 0.07 mag in JHK,\nand are reported in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nTable 3. Summary of the properties of GRB 090102.\n\n3.2.4\n\n2.4 implies \u03b2O,obs = 1.32. A non zero extinction would cause\na flatter \u03b2O , thus one should consider this as an upper limit:\n\u03b2O < 1.32. The value of the optical-to-X-ray spectral index\nis \u03b2OX > 0.53 \u00b1 0.04.\n\nTemporal and spectral behaviors\n\nThe optical light curve can be fit using a broken power law\nmodel, with a break time on the order of 1000 s. As can be\nseen in Fig. 2, the light curve flattens at that time. It is worth\nnoting that this flattening cannot be due to the host galaxy,\nfainter than R\u223c 24 (Levan et al. 2009) when the afterglow\nmagnitude is of the order of R\u223c 19 \u2212 20. Before the break,\nthe decay index is \u03b11,O = 1.50 \u00b1 0.06, steeper than the\nX-ray decay index at the same date (see Table 3). After the\nbreak, the decay index is \u03b12,0 = 0.97 \u00b1 0.03, flatter than the\nX-ray decay index at the same time. We do not observe any\ncolor variation (both in optical and in X-rays) before and\nafter the temporal break seen in optical (see Table 4).

In this article we prefer to focus on the\nconstraints we can set on the GRB models, and thus we cannot make any assumption on the afterglow continuum. As a\n\n\f6\n\nB. Gendre et al.\n\nTable 2.

As a matter of consequence, we cannot\nderive the host extinction from the optical photometric data\nalone.\nHowever, we are able to provide two comments. First,\nin the host frame, we have an X-ray measurement of NH =\n21\n8.8+2.7\ncm\u22122 . This may imply that significant local\n\u22122.5 \u00d7 10\nextinction is present. Within our galaxy, this would lead to\nAV = 4.9+1.5\n\u22121.4 , that can be considered as an upper limit (see\nthe discussion of Stratta et al. 2004).\nFinally, in the host frame we have measurements ranging from 180.1 nm to 852.2 nm, i.e. covering the UV to \u223c I\nbands. This last band should be the least affected by the host\nextinction. This is, however, not a band free of extinction,\n\nMODEL FITTING\nStandard model\n\nWe first used the prescriptions of Panaitescu & Kumar\n(2000) and the X-ray data alone in order to test the standard\nmodel. They are summarized in Table 6 (from Sari et al.\n1998; Sari & Piran 1999; Rhoads 1997). As one can see from\nthis Table, in order to accommodate the standard model\nand the measurements made in X-ray, we should have the\ncooling frequency located above the X-ray band during\nthe entirety of the observation. In such a case, a value of\np = 2\u03b2X = 2.7 \u00b1 0.2 can fit both the spectral and temporal X-ray indices if the surrounding medium has a constant\ndensity. However, a constant density medium implies that\nthe cooling frequency is decreasing as t\u22120.5 . Any crossing\nof this frequency within the X-ray band would appear as a\nsimultaneous increase in the spectral index by 0.5 and in\nthe temporal decay index by 0.25. While the latter could\nbe accommodated by the broken power law model, the former is not supported by the data. This implies that the\ncooling frequency should be above the X-ray band up to\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 105 s after the event, or above 800 keV at the start\nof the X-ray observation (thus implying very small values of\n\u01ebB and/or Etot , the energy fraction located within the magnetic field and the total energy of the fireball respectively\nPanaitescu & Kumar 2000). This is unlikely; moreover, in\nsuch a case, according to the model, the optical light curve\nshould decay either with the same slope than the X-ray light\ncurve or with a decay index of 0.5 (Panaitescu & Kumar\n2000): both hypotheses are ruled out by the data.\nIn conclusion, the standard model alone, in its simplest\nexpression,\ncannot reproduce the global spectral and tem1.2\nporal behavior of the afterglow of GRB 090102.\n\n4.2\n\nTwo component models\n\nThe afterglow of GRB 061126 features the same temporal and spectral behavior as the one of GRB 090102\n(Perley et al. 2008; Gomboc et al. 2008, see also Table 3).\nThese authors used a multi-component model rather than\nthe standard fireball model in order to explain the broadband data of this burst. We thus checked if inserting an\nadditional component to the fireball model could reproduce\nthe data of the afterglow of GRB 090102.\nThe first step was to decide in which band we see the signature of the extra-component, and in which band the fireball model alone can reproduce both the spectral and temporal properties. In the standard fireball model, the fact that\nthe optical and X-ray light curves do not present the same\ndecay implies that a specific frequency (either the cooling\nor the injection frequency, see their definition in M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\n2006) is located between the optical and X-ray bands. Below the injection frequency, the decay index should be 0.5.\nWith an optical decay of \u03b11,O = 1.50 \u00b1 0.06, we can rule\n\n\f8\n\nB. Gendre et al.\n\nTable 6. Closure relationships in the standard fireball model computed using the spectral and temporal information from the X-ray\nband. The specific frequency is \u03bdc (the cooling frequency) in the slow cooling regime, or \u03bdm (the injection frequency) in the case of fast\ncooling. All errors are quoted at the 90 % confidence level. Due to the absence of measured spectral index in the optical, optical values\nof the relationships are not reported\nMedium class\nand\ngeometry\n\nCooling\nregime\n\nSpecific\nfrequency\nposition\n\nClosure\nrelationship\n\nIsotropic Wind\n\nFast\n\n\u03bdm < \u03bdX\n\u03bdm > \u03bdX\n\u03bdc < \u03bdX\n\u03bdc > \u03bdX\n\u03bdm < \u03bdX\n\u03bdm > \u03bdX\n\u03bdc < \u03bdX\n\u03bdc > \u03bdX\n\u03bdc < \u03bdX\n\u03bdc > \u03bdX\n\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 + 0.5 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 0.5\u03b2 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 + 0.5 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 \u2212 0.5 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 + 0.5 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 0.5\u03b2 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 + 0.5 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 1.5\u03b2 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2 = 0\n\u03b1 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u2212 1.0 = 0\n\nSlow\nIsotropic ISM\n\nFast\nSlow\n\nJetted fireball\n\nSlow\n\nout this hypothesis, and deduce that the cooling frequency\nneeds to be located between the optical and X-ray bands.\nThis is not compatible with the X-ray data (see Table 6):\nan extra component in the X-ray band is the only solution\nto solve this issue.\n\nUnder the above assumption, the optical band can be\ndescribed by the fireball model and it is the X-ray band that\nneeds an extra component in addition to the fireball in order\nto be described. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by\nchecking if the optical band can indeed be fit with the standard model. In fact, the flattening of the optical light curve\naround 1 ks is not possible in the standard model. However,\nseveral \"common additions\" to the standard model can provide an explanation: the addition of a reverse shock in the\nearly optical data or a change in the surrounding medium\ndensity profile (the termination shock, see Chevalier et al.\n2004; Ramirez-Ruiz et al. 2001). In the latter case, we can\nderive a value of p = 4/3\u03b12,O + 1 = 2.29 \u00b1 0.04. The physical\nposition of the termination shock cannot be constrained due\nto the presence of a second component in the X-ray data. We\ncan thus conclude that our hypothesis is valid: the optical\nband can be fit with the standard model.\n\nLastly, one then needs to provide for the physical nature of the additional X-ray component. The requirements\nare that it needs to be: non-thermal, at all times brighter\nthan the forward shock emission responsible for the optical\nemission, decaying monotonously without spectral variation,\nand producing few (if any) optical emissions. We do not conclude on the mechanism that produces these extra photons\nin X-ray. However, the latter requirement is the more constraining one, as already noted by Perley et al. (2008) for\nGRB 061126: it is quite difficult to accommodate a mechanism that produces X-rays without also producing optical\nphotons. Note additionally that late in the light curve (after\n1 ks), the standard model implies that the X-ray spectral\nindex is p/2 \u223c 1.2.

Slightly\nlater, when the CB encounters the wind/ejecta, the electrons of the ionized gas in front of it are swept into the CB\nand are Fermi accelerated by its turbulent magnetic field,\nemitting synchrotron radiation that dominates the prompt\noptical emission and the broad band afterglow emission.\nThus, the observed emissions are due to two components: a\nshort lasting Inverse Compton Scattering component, seen\nonly at high energy, and a classical synchrotron emission\n(Dado & Dar 2009).\nFollowing the notations and prescriptions of Dado et al.\n(2009), we can explain all the X-ray data assuming that we\nobserve the synchrotron emission of a CB traveling within\na medium of constant density (the so-called ISM) with the\nbend frequency located below the X-ray band. From the\nmodel, which gives, in that case \u03b2X = p/2, we can derive\np = 1.7 \u00b1 0.2. This value of p implies \u03b1X = \u03b2 + 0.5 =\np/2 + 0.5 = 1.35 \u00b1 0.1, in perfect agreement with our finding\n(\u03b1X = 1.34 \u00b1 0.02). We note that this value of p is lower\nthan 2, and thus there should be a break/cutoff located at\nhigh energy so that the electron energy remains finite.\nIn the optical, things are more complicated. According to Dado et al. (2009), the spectral index in the optical should evolve from \u03b2O \u2248 0.5 during the prompt emission to \u03b2O \u2248 0.83 \u00b1 0.09 (i.e. the same as that in X-ray)\nduring the late-time afterglow. Both values are compatible\nwith the constraint derived from the color of the afterglow\n(\u03b2 6 1.32). During the prompt optical emission, the decay index should be \u03b1O = \u03b2O + 1 \u2248 1.5 (see Eq. 33 in\nDado et al. 2009). This is consistent with the observed value\nof \u03b11,O = 1.50 \u00b1 0.06. The flattening of the optical light\ncurve may be explained by a transition from a wind envi-\n\n\fMulti-wavelength observations of GRB 090102\nronment to an ISM (as in the fireball model, see above). In\nsuch a case, the light curve should reach an asymptotic decay with \u03b12,O = \u03b1X = 1.34 \u00b1 0.09 (see Eqs. 29 and 30 in\nDado et al. 2009). We observed a value of \u03b12,O = 0.97\u00b10.03.\nHowever, the value of \u03b12,O = 1.34 \u00b1 0.09 is only an asymptotic value, and the observed could vary if the observation\nis close to the time of the crossing of the bend frequency.\nIn fact, we should observe an effective temporal decay index\n\u03b12 (t) = \u03b2O (t)+1/2 evolving from \u03b12 \u223c 1 to \u03b12 = 1.34\u00b10.02.\nBeing close to the asymptotic value, the measurement is\nmarginally compatible with the CB model expectation. Lack\nof late time temporal and spectral data prevents a confirmation of this prediction. Indeed, once reaching the asymptotic\nvalues, the CB model indicates that we should observe the\nsame spectral and temporal behavior for the optical and Xray bands. Looking to Fig. 3, this is hardly supported by\nthe data. However, a large gray extinction, with AI \u223c 2.5\nwould make compatible the optical and X-ray emissions. In\nthe absence of information about the host extinction, we\ncannot rule out such an extinction, and the CB model may\nindeed reproduce all the data with the expense of a few fine\ntunings.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented observations of the afterglow of\nGRB 090102. We used data taken by optical telescopes and\nby the XRT on board the Swift spacecraft. The light curve\nof this event features an unusual behavior. In X-rays, it\npresents a very smooth light curve with no hint of a temporal break. In the optical, the light curve presents a steep-flat\nbehavior, with a break time at \u223c 1 ks after the burst. This\nunusual light curve was also observed with GRB 061126. The\nstandard fireball model cannot reproduce the observations\nwithout the addition of several components. The addition of\na component at high energy solves the discrepancies between\nthe optical and X-ray emissions. The optical data could then\nbe interpreted as either due to a termination shock, locating\nthe end of the free-wind bubble at the position of the optical\nbreak; or as a normal fireball expanding in an ISM, with a\nreverse shock present at an early time (less than 1 ks after the event). Any radio observations that could constrain\nthe ISM density value would also constrain the wind density, and thus a key property of the progenitor of this GRB.\nHowever, the weak point of this model is that requires strong\nfine tuning in order to suppress the optical emission of the\nadditional component, responsible for the X-ray emission.\nThe cannonball model can also partly reproduce the data.\nIt appears clear, however, that in order to explain the broadband emission, some fine-tuning of this model is mandatory,\nlikewise for the fireball model.\nThe strange behavior of GRB 090102 provides a useful\ntest-event for models that attempt to reproduce and explain\nthe GRB phenomenon. The choice of the models tested here\nwas strongly limited by the very small number of models\nthat have published formulae of the temporal and spectral\nindices for GRB afterglows. Of course, we do not pretend to\nbe exhaustive in our testing as the array of alternative models is huge. Swift has shown the diversity of GRB afterglows,\nand it may now be time for observers to test and reduce the\ndiversity of GRB afterglow models.\n\n9\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank G.
