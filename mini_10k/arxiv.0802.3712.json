Because of those\nconstraints they infer limits to the size of proposed compact extra dimensions. Central to\nthe E\u00f6t-Wash experiment is a unique torsion balance. The torsion balance is frequently the\ninstrument of choice when attempting to investigate weak forces because it can be constructed\nso as to have a very long period. This is another way to say that it can be modeled as a very\nweak spring. This in turn means that the instrument's deflection (angular deflection for the\ntorsion balance) can be very large for a given applied force (torque). This is also the curse\nof using the instrument since deflections will be observed from a variety of undesired sources.\nThe experimental challenge is to design the instrument to minimize the undesired deflections\nwhile maximizing the desired effect.\nWe usually think of a torsion balance as consisting of a long thin fiber supporting a dumbbell or a mass dipole. A gravitational gradient will exert a torque on this dipole and the\ntorque can be determined either by measuring the angular deflection of the dipole or by measuring the frequency of oscillation of the pendulum and comparing it to its frequency of small\noscillation about its equilibrium position. The modern torsion balance is mechanically more\nsophisticated and constructed to eliminate, as much as possible, undesired mass multipole\nmoments[2, 3] such as the dipole moment. The E\u00f6t-Wash apparatus is designed to be, with\nthe exception of small calibration masses and the mirrors used to reflect the measurement\nlight beam, cylindrically symmetric. The detection element is a circular disk that forms the\nbottom of the cylinder. This detection disk is made sensitive to horizontal gravitational forces\nby drilling a pattern of holes in it (the E\u00f6t-Wash group thinks of these holes as negative or\nmissing mass). In the current experiment there are 42 holes in the detection disk, arranged in\n21-fold azimuthal symmetry. Such an arrangement in isolation is insensitive to a gravitational\ngradient. This statement ignores the mass balancing that must be done to eliminate the mass\nmultipole moments arising because of imperfections in construction and assembly.\nA second circular plate is drilled with 42 holes in the same pattern and aligned with and\nplaced below and close to the detector plate. The authors refer to this plate as the attractor\nplate. If its holes are directly aligned with the holes in the detector plate it will exert no\ntorque on the torsion balance. However if the attractor plate is rotated about the common\ncenter axis so that the holes are displaced azimuthally its missing mass will interact with the\nmissing mass of the detector plate and exert a torque on the balance, causing it to rotate.\nRotating the attractor plate at an angular frequency \u03c9 will, because of the 21-fold symmetry,\ninduce a primary torque at 21\u03c9 on the torsion balance. There are also components of the\ntorque at higher harmonics of 21\u03c9.\nFrom an experimental standpoint this is usually a very desirable setup. An input at a\nlow frequency results in an output at a higher frequency. In the detection system the signal\nat 21\u03c9 will not be contaminated by pickup from the source that drives the attractor plate\nat frequency \u03c9. Varying \u03c9 allows the experimenter to place the signal appropriately with\nrespect to the free oscillation frequency of the torsion balance. For these experiments the free\noscillation period was between 500 and 650 seconds.\nThe description to this point describes the principal attributes of most of the recent E\u00f6tWash designs[4]. The new thing in this experiment is in the design of the lower attractor disk\nwhich is made of two circular disks, placed one on top of the other. The second lower disk\n8\n\n\fis drilled with 21 holes with twice the diameter of each of the holes on the upper disk. The\nlower disk is rotated by 360/42 degrees with respect to the upper one so that the holes on the\nlower disk are directly below the mass between the holes on the upper disk. The thickness of\nthe lower disk is chosen so that the missing mass of the lower disk combined with the missing\nmass of the upper disk would exert practically no torque on the detector plate if the inverse\nsquare law holds (emphasis by the E\u00f6t-Wash group). Thus the experiment is designed to look\nfor violations of the inverse square law at close distances.\nI must, at this point, pay homage to those who built this and the previous experiments.\nA sensitive torsion balance is subject to being deflected by almost anything. Stray electric\ncharges, magnetic impurities, unmodeled gravitational potentials; all of those are capable\nof causing extraneous excursions of the torsion balance. The spacing between the attractor\ndisk and the detection disk is such that even the Casimir-Polder effect (which was only first\nmeasured in 1958 and precisely measured in 1997) has to be neutralized.\nThe authors parameterize[4, 5] any violation of the inverse square law by adding a Yukawa\nterm to the Newtonian potential:\nV =\u2212\n\nR\nGM\n(1 + \u03b1e\u2212 \u03bb )\nR\n\nand assert that the torque would not cancel if \u03bb were less than the thickness of the upper\ndisk which in this experiment is approximately 1 mm. They convert their measured angular\nresponses into torques (the calibration is very elegant using a rotating external gravitational\noctopole) and plot the measured torques and calculated torques against the separation of the\nattractor and detection disks and display plots of the residuals. These residual plots must\nhave gotten people in the lab very excited at one time. They eventually exclude any Yukawa\ntype interaction with |\u03b1| = 1 and \u03bb > 56 microns. These results are then used to make\ninferences about the allowed size of compact dimensions in some of the postulated corrections\nto Newtonian gravity.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.J. Kapner, T.S.

Sopuerta, Institute of Space Sciences, National Spanish Research Council\n(ICE-CSIC) sopuerta-at-ieec.uab.es\nThe Capra meetings are devoted to the study of radiation reaction in General Relativity,\na key problem in order to understand the general-relativistic dynamics of a two-body system.\nProbably, the main application of these studies is the description of the inspiral dynamics\nof stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes in galactic centers, also known as\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a primary scientific target for the future ESA/NASA\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Simulating EMRIs we can obtain gravitational waveform templates that will be crucial for the analysis of the LISA data. The\nscientific outcome of these observations ranges from tests of the no-hair theorem for black\nholes to the determination of stellar populations and the study of dynamics of galactic nuclei.\nIn this sense, the Capra meetings and the community created around them has contributed\nmuch of the progress in the understanding of the radiation reaction problem and in the description of the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission of EMRIs.\nThe Capra series of meetings started in August 1998 at a ranch in northeastern San Diego\ncounty once owned by Frank Capra, the celebrated American film director, a Caltech alumnus\nwho donated the ranch to Caltech, hence the name of the meeting. The series continued at\nthe following venues: UCD, Dublin (1999); Caltech, Pasadena (2000); AEI, Potsdam (2001);\nPenn State, State College (2002); YITP, Kyoto (2003); CGWA, Brownsville (2004); RAL,\nAbingdon (2005); and UWM, Milwaukee (2006).\nThis year, the tenth edition of the Capra Meeting and Workshop took place at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, from June 24th to June 29th, 2007. It was organized by Lior\nBurko and was funded by the College of Science of the University of Alabama in Huntsville.\nSpecial thanks go to Jack Fix, and to Cindy Brasher and Dora Wynn for administrative\nsupport. The meeting was attended by 26 researchers from research/academic institutions in\n7 countries.\nFollowing the tradition of previous years, the meeting consisted of two parts: In the first\none (June 25-27) the participants presented research talks, whereas the second one (June 2729) was a workshop aimed at facilitating discussions, brainstorming, and collaboration. The\nprogram and an electronic version of all talks are available online at:\nhttp://gravity.uah.edu/capra10/program.htm\nThis year's meeting can be characterized by the amount of numerical work presented,\nespecially in the time domain, which illustrates the progress in the field, in the sense that we\nare in a period in which a substantial part of the efforts are directed towards the numerical\nimplementation of the analytical developments of past research by the Capra community.\nAnother highlight of the conference was the celebration of the 60th birthday of Steve Detweiler,\none of the main contributors to the Capra community and, after this year's edition, the person\nwith most attendances at the meeting.\nThe meeting started with a summary by Leor Barack (Southampton) of the progress that\nthe Relativity group at Southampton is making in the development of techniques and numerical algorithms, in the time domain, for the computation of the self-force. The talk served as\nan introduction to the presentations of the other Southampton group members present at the\nmeeting. The first one was Norichika Sago, who presented work on the numerical calculations\n10\n\n\fof the gravitational self-force, in the Lorenz gauge, for a particle orbiting a Schwarzschild\nblack hole. The case of circular orbits has been completed [1] and the case of generic (eccentric) orbits is well underway. Darren Golbourn, also from Southampton, gave a talk on\na new technique to regularize the self-force due to scalar-field perturbations from a particle\norbiting a non-rotating black hole and its numerical implementation [2]. This work is done\nusing a 2+1 spacetime domain, which paves the way for a future extension to the case of a\nspinning Kerr black hole. The technique proposed consists of subtracting from each azimuthal\nmode of the retarded field a piece that describes the singular behavior of the scalar field near\nthe particle. This is done through a careful analytical analysis of the scalar field near the\nparticle, which is referred to by the authors as a puncture scheme, and indeed it resembles\nthe puncture approach used in simulations in numerical relativity. After the break, Ian Vega\n(Gainesville) presented work along the same lines as the previous talk but using a different\napproach. In this talk the regularization procedure is based on the use of smeared-out sources\nin the scalar field equations, in the sense that the practical implementation consists of applying a window function to an analytical approximation to the singular part of the scalar field\n(the approximation is constructed using THZ coordinates). This also leads to an equation for\nthe regular part involving an extended non-singular source. The numerical calculations are\ndone using an evolution code in a 1+1 spacetime domain. Lior Burko (Hunstville) discussed\nprogress in the time-domain extraction of extreme-mass-ratio binary waveforms by means of a\nTeukolsky numerical code in a 2+1 domain and two ways of regularizing the particle sources:\n(i) considering a smeared-out source based on the use of a Gaussian as an approximation to\nthe Dirac delta distribution [3], and (ii) using a discretized version of the Dirac delta distribution that has a finite support in the computational domain [4]. These calculations improve\nsubstantially the accuracy achieved with previous computational schemes.\nThe second day was opened by Paul Anderson (Wake Forest) with a talk on the calculation\nof the self-force using the Hadamard-WKB expansion. This is a completely analytic technique\nand the aim is to compute the non-local contribution to the self-force (tail term) by means\nof a quasi-local expansion. The case of a particle subject to a scalar field was shown as\nan illustration, and included a discussion of the range of validity of this type of expansion.\nTed Newman (Pittsburgh) presented a new approach, based on recent work [5, 6], to the\nstudy of radiation reaction by looking at solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations in the\nfuture null asymptotic region. Introducing a complex worldline identified as the center of\nmass and charge of the system (which were assumed to coincide), it is found that its equation\nof motion includes the known radiation-reaction terms. Adam Pound (Guelph) discussed in\nthe first part of his talk how to define adiabatic and radiative approximations to the motion\nof EMRIs, and what their ambiguities and limitations are. In the second part, using the\nmethod of osculating orbits in combination with a two-timescale expansion, he characterized\nthe type of errors that can be produced in the time-dependence of the orbit, in particular in\nthe phase. This was illustrated in test cases of motion under post-Newtonian electromagnetic\nand gravitational self-forces [7, 8]. Larry Price (Gainesville) reviewed recent progress on\nperturbation theory of a Kerr black hole in relation to the construction of Hertz potentials,\ndiscussing the existence of radiation gauges and the question of non-radiated multipoles [9].\nBernard Whiting (Gainesville) continued with this topic and described several tools that can\nhelp advancing in this line: GHP formalism tools, separability, symmetry operators, etc.\nRoland Haas (Guelph) gave the last talk of the day. He presented recent results on the\nnumerical computation, using time-domain techniques, of the scalar self-force on eccentric\norbits around a Schwarzschild black hole [10]. The numerical algorithm used is a fourth-order\naccurate generalization of the characteristic code proposed initially by Lousto and Price. He\n11\n\n\falso presented a generalization of the regularization parameters of the mode-sum regularization\nscheme to the case of non-geodesic motion.\nThe third day started with a talk by Carlos Sopuerta (Guelph) on numerical methods\nin the time-domain for the computation of the gravitational perturbations generated by a\nparticle orbiting a non-rotating black hole. He discussed 1+1 algorithms based on the finite\nelement and the pseudospectral collocation methods, showing results for circular orbits and\ndiscussing the prospects for the use of this method in the case of a spinning black hole and\ncalculations of the self-force. Dong-Hoon Kim (Golm) gave a talk on the calculation of the\nself-force, via the mode-sum scheme, on a particle moving around a slowly rotating black hole.\nAfter the break, Bernard Whiting introduced Steve Detweiler (Gainesville) and honored him\non the occasion of his 60th birthday, emphasizing the importance of Steve's work not only\nin the context of the Capra science but in the broader context of General Relativity and its\nastrophysical applications. In his talk, Steve gave a broad picture of the gravitational selfforce effects on orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole. He reminded us about the main\nissues that need to be tackled: Kerr metric perturbations from the Teukolsky formalism,\nsearch for gauge-invariant quantities, second-order perturbations generated by a particle, etc.\nHe also summarized some of the progress already done and presented during the meeting.\nJonathan Thornburg (Southampton) gave an introduction to adaptive mesh refinement in\ndouble-null coordinates, based on the Berger and Oliger scheme. He discussed the potential\napplications of this numerical technique to self-force calculations and how it can help reducing\ntheir computational cost. The part of the meeting devoted to talks ended with a presentation\nby Sam Gralla (Chicago) on the locality of the tail integral involved in the calculation of the\nself-force. His conclusion was that in the general case this integral must be highly non-local.\nThe rest of the time was allocated for the workshop. The participants were provided with\na nice atmosphere to discuss progress and collaborate. In between discussions, and thanks to\nthe generous hospitality of the U.S. Space and Rocket Center and Mr. Cliff Broderick, the\norganizers and participants enjoyed a very interesting and instructive visit.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.

Porto, Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106\nrporto-at-physics.ucsb.edu\nThe fourth installment of the, by now traditional, 'Quantum Gravity in the Southern Cone'\nmeeting took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay, as it did eleven years ago when this series\nfirst launched. The purpose of this workshop was twofold. Firstly as was expected, it allowed\nscientists from all over the world to gather together, present new ideas and discuss the many\ndifferent approaches to a quantum theory of gravity. Secondly, it provided an opportunity to\ncelebrate the physics of Rodolfo Gambini on the occasion of his 60th birthday (although he\nis 61 by now).\nThe workshop had over 100 participants, including plenary talks by Abhay Ashtekar, David\nBerenstein, Martin Bojowald, Laurent Freidel, Juan Maldacena, David Mattingly, Herman\nNicolai, Rafael Porto and Marcus Spradlin. There were afternoon sessions with talks by Jorge\nAlfaro, Andres Anabalon, William Cuervo, Alcides Garat, Horacio Girotti, Eduardo Guendelman, Olivera Miskovic, Maria Parisi, Albert Petrov, Michael Reisenberger, Carlos Reyes,\nDavi Rodrigues, Jose Vergara, Victor Taveras, Francesco Toppan and Luis Urrutia. Also\nJorge Pullin reviewed Rodolfo's early work and its impact on a talk entitled 'The Physics of\nRodolfo'. In addition several participants contributed posters. The program and links to the\ntalks can be found at http://qgsciv.fisica.edu.uy\nThe plenary talks covered different areas although we had three talks on the ADS/CFT\n(Anti-De Sitter/ Conformal Field Theory) correspondence and another three with a Loop\nQuantum Gravity (LQG) taste. Juan Maldacena gave an introduction to the ADS/CFT correspondence, the new developments and attempts to understand strongly coupled theories,\nsuch as QCD, as well as gluon scattering amplitudes. Marcus Spradlin elaborated on multiloop gluon amplitudes. Maldacena made two important remarks about ADS/CFT, namely\nLorentz Invariance (LI) is preserved by quantization (in the sense that the dual QFT preserves conformal symmetry) and also on the issue of background independence, where it was\npointed out that there is a sum over all possible geometries with ADS boundary conditions.\nOne may argue on the necessity of a DS/CFT correspondence, or trying to implement flat\nboundary conditions. This however seems far from understood. During the question session\nthe issue of whether ADS/CFT applies to QCD was brought up. Maldacena emphasized\nthat the duality provides a sort of Ising Model as in Condensed Matter physics. One may\nwonder then whether we can do any better, and whether N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory and\nQCD are in the same 'universality class'. Aiming in the opposite direction to the ADS/CFT\nconjecture, David Berenstein talked about emergent geometry and the wave function of the\nuniverse. His talk centered on how to perform a strong coupling expansion by reducing the\nproblem to spherically symmetric configurations in a matrix model of commuting hermitian\nmatrices.\nIn the LQG corner, Abhay Ashtekar spoke about how quantum geometry extends its life\npast the classical singularities of GR. Ashtekar concentrated on the Big Bang, discussed Loop\nQuantum Cosmology (LQC), and in particular the FRW model. He also introduced the idea\nof \"New Quantum Mechanics\" , and that the holonomies are the right objects to be quantized rather than the connection. Given the so called 'Bohr compactification', LQC allows\nfor inequivalent representations (bypassing the Von Neumann theorem), and therefore avoid13\n\n\fance of singularities unlike in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach. In LQC (relational) evolution\nis deterministic across the classical big bang. The main open issue in LQC is whether it can\nbe systematically derived from full LQG due to the 'gauge fixing' imposed along the way.\nMartin Bojowald covered LQC as well. Bojowald also talked about the effective description,\nwhere expectation values are obtained in a systematic fashion by solving a set of effective\nequations in the semiclassical regime, though accounting for 'quantum corrections', and also\nits application to cosmology. Also on the LQG side Laurent Freidel discussed spin foam models for 4d gravity. Freidel talked about the topological BF theory and its quantization, how\nto implement the simplicity constraints of gravity, and how the resulting spin foam model\nresembles the kinematical states (spin networks) in LQG. Yet is there to understand the link\nwith the dynamics.\nAmong the plenary speakers we also had Hermann Nicolai talking about 'Re-inventing M\ntheory'. Nicolai talked about E10 , and how it incorporates many relations between maximal\nsupergravity theories. Victor Rivelles talked about the S-matrix of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin\nmodel and its connection with the ADS/CFT correspondence. Jorge Zanelli, who spoke\nabout Chern-Simons gravity and the Universe as a topological defect, and Maximo Banados\non GR with g\u03bc\u03bd = 0 as the 'ground state', where diffeomorphisms act as isometries. Banados\nelaborated on a would-be theory of gravity which incorporates the 'no metric' condition and\nargued this theory could provide candidates for dark energy and dark matter. David Mattingly\ntalked about violations of LI (LIV) and QG phenomenology. Experimental constraints on\nLIV are very tight. Also, even if one argues that violations come from higher dimensional\noperators, d \u2264 4 operators can be generated by radiative corrections. That introduces fine\ntunning, which one may argue could be avoided if CPT is unbroken, and SUSY is implemented,\nthough broken at the TeV scale. From a QG point of view, LIV are highly suppressed, and\nthat represents a strong constraint on the theories.\nSummarizing, the meeting was very fruitful and interactive, with many discussions and\nexchange of ideas taking place. The next meeting will take place in Brasil.\n\n14\n\n\f"}
