This first result was quickly followed by the detection of bright\nH2 line emission from more distant galaxies (Egami et al. 2006, Ogle et al. 2007) and from the NGC 1275\nand NGC 4696 cooling flows (Johnstone et al. 2007). These H2 -bright galaxies may represent an important\nsignature of galaxy evolution, but this unusual emission accompanied by little (or no) star formation has not yet\nbeen explained. Because of the absence or relative weakness of star forming signatures (dust features, ionized\ngas lines) in the mid-infrared Spitzer spectra, their exceptional H2 luminosity may trace a burst of kinetic\nenergy dissipation associated with galaxy interaction, gas infall or AGN feedback. In \u00a7 2 we briefly present the\nH2 -luminous compilation of objects observed by Spitzer. In \u00a7 3 we summarize the results obtained from our\nmodel (P. Guillard et al. 2008) of the SQ post-shock gas. Then \u00a7 4 discuss the implications of these results on\nour understanding of the kinetic energy dissipation in these systems.\n2\n\nAn Emerging Population of H2 -Bright Sources\n\nFig. 1 shows a sample of this new class of extremely luminous H2 emission galaxies, up to 1010 L\u2299 in pure\nrotational molecular hydrogen emission lines and relatively weak total IR emission(Ogle et al. 2009, in prep.).\nThe most contrasted examples show bright H2 emission lines with no spectroscopic signature (dust or ionized\ngas lines) of star formation (Appleton et al. 2006, Ogle et al. 2007). In many of these galaxies, molecular gas\nhas been detected through the mid-IR H2 rotational lines prior to any CO observation. The same properties\n1\n\nInstitut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, UMR 8617, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud 11, 91400 Orsay\nc\n\n\f238\n\nSF2A 2008\n\nFig. 1. The H2 rotational lines emission is compared with the PAH emission in the 7.7 micron band (left side). The\nlarge black symbols represent averages for samples of galaxies. The smaller symbols represent individual galaxies. At all\nIR luminosities, the observations reveal galaxies with excess H2 emission on top of the Star Formation (SF) contribution\ndefined by SF dominated galaxies (dashed line). These H2 -Galaxies (MOHEGs) include active galactic nuclei galaxies\n(Seyferts, LINERs and radio galaxies), cooling flows (Perseus A, ZW3146) and colliding galaxies/mergers (SQ and NGC\n6240). The excess H2 emission reveals large (up to 1010 M\u2299 ) quantities of warm (T > 150 K) molecular gas. On the\nright side we show for comparison an example of spectra of the 3C326 H2 -luminous radio-galaxy (from Ogle et al. 2007)\nwith respect to normal star forming galaxies (adapted from Brandl et al. 2006)\n\nof the H2 emission are observed in different types of objects that characterize key-processes at work in galaxy\nformation and evolution: gas accretion, galaxy interactions, gas ejection due to star formation or to the action\nof the central black hole on its environment. In each case, H2 lines appear to have an unexpected contribution\nto the gas cooling.\n3\n\nThe Stephan's Quintet: a ideal laboratory to study H2 Energetics in Galaxy-Wide Shocks\n\nSQ is a nearby (94 Mpc) H2 -luminous source where observations provide a clear astrophysical context to study\nthe origin of the H2 emission. A wide (5 \u00d7 25 kpc) shock is creating by a galaxy (NGC 7318b) colliding into a\ntidal tail at a relative velocity of \u223c 1 000 km s\u22121 . Evidence for a galaxy-wide shock comes from observations\nof X-rays from the hot post-shock gas (Trinchieri et al. 1003, 2005), strong radio synchrotron emission from\nthe radio emitting plasma (Sulentic et al. 2001) and shocked-gas excitation diagnostics from optical emission\nlines (Xu et al. 2003). The surprise comes out from Spitzer observations that show that this gas also contain\nmolecular hydrogen with an H2 linewidth of 870 km s\u22121 (Appleton et al. 2006). The main energy reservoir\nis the bulk kinetic energy of the gas. A minor fraction of the collision energy is used to heat the hot plasma.\nThe H2 surface brightness is larger than the X-ray emission from the same region, thus the H2 line emission\ndominates over X-ray cooling in the center of the shock. As such, it plays a major role in the energy dissipation\nand evolution of the post-shock gas.\nWe propose a scenario where a large-scale shock wave overtakes an inhomogeneous pre-shock medium (Guil-\n\n\fH2 Energetics in Galaxy-wide Shocks: Insights in Starburst Triggering and Galaxy Formation\n\nFig. 2. The multiphasic post-shock medium. The dust\nlifetime, H2 formation and gas cooling (full line) time\nscales in the SQ post-shock gas are plotted as a function\nof the post-shock temperature. Each shock velocity corresponds to a post-shock temperature or density. The\nordering of the timescales separates the 3 main phases\nof the post-shock gas. The comparison of the H2 formation time scale with the SQ shock age (\u223c 5 \u00d7 106 yr,\nindicated by the position of the bars) show where H2\nmolecules can form (blue bar).\n\n239\n\nFig. 3. Schematic view at the gas evolutionary cycle\nproposed in our interpretation of Stephan's Quintet optical and H2 observations. Arrows represent the mass\nflows between the H II, warm H I, warm and cold H2\ngas components. They are numbered for clarity. The\ndynamical interaction between gas phases drives the cycle. The mass flow values and associated timescales are\nderived from the H\u03b1 , Oi, and H2 luminosities and model\ncalculations. Heating of the cold H2 gas (red arrows) is\nnecessary to account for the increasing mass flow from\nthe ionized gas to cold H2 phases.\n\nlard et al. 2008, submitted). The collision speed is the shock speed in the low density volume filling gas. The\npost-shock pressure of the hot gas drives slower shocks into denser gas. The post-shock gas is thus heated to\na range of temperatures that depend on the pre-shock gas density. Our model quantifies the gas cooling, dust\ndestruction, H2 formation and excitation in the post-shock medium (Fig. 2).\nSchematically, the low density volume filling pre-shock gas, shocked at high velocities (\u223c 600 km s\u22121 )\nbecomes a dust-free X-ray emitting plasma. The cooling timescale of the hot gas is more than one order of\nmagnitude greater than the shock age (5 \u00d7 106 yr ). Therefore the post-shock plasma does not have the time\nto cool down and form molecular gas since the shock was initiated. Denser gas is heated at lower temperatures\nand dust survives. In the context of the SQ shock, we show that these clouds have time to cool down and\nform H2 before being disrupted. We show that the cooling of the Hii or Hi gas cannot explain the observed\nH2 emission, but that low-velocity (5 \u2212 20 km s\u22121 ) shocks driven into molecular fragments can account for it.\nWe propose that these shocks are generated by cloud fragments collisions. The supersonic turbulence in the\nmolecular fragments is powered by a slow energy and momentum transfer from the bulk motion of the gas. The\nturbulent energy of the post-shock gas drives a mass cycle across the different gas phases where H2 is forming\nout of the hot gas.\n4\n\nThe Cycling of Gas across ISM Phases\n\nIn this section, we place the Spitzer H2 detection in the broader context set by optical observations. We\npropose a picture of the post-shock gas evolution that sketches the dynamical interaction between gas phases.\nThis interpretation introduces a physical framework that may apply to H2 luminous galaxies in general.\nA schematic cartoon of the evolutionary picture of the post-shock gas which arises from our data interpretation is presented in Fig. 3. It sketches a global view that we detail here. Black and red arrows represent the\nmass flows between the H II, warm H I, warm and cold H2 gas components of the post-shock gas. The large\n\n\f240\n\nSF2A 2008\n\narrow to the left symbolizes the relative motion between the warm and cold gas and the surrounding plasma.\nEach of the black arrows is labeled with its main associated process: gas recombination and ionization (arrow\nnumber 1), H2 formation (2) and H2 cooling (3). The values of the mass flows and the associated timescales\nare derived from observations and our model calculations (see Guillard et al. 2008 for details).\nA continuous cycle through gas components is excluded by the increasing mass flow needed to account for\nthe H\u03b1 , Oi, and H2 luminosities. Heating of the cold H2 gas towards warmer gas states (red arrows) needs to\noccur. It is the dissipation of the gas mechanical energy that powers these red arrows. The post-shock molecular\ncloud fragments are likely to experience a distribution of shock velocities, depending on their size and density.\nArrow number 4 represents the low velocity magnetic shocks excitation of H2 gas that can account for the H2\nemission (described in Guillard et al.). More energetic shocks may dissociate the molecular gas (arrows number\n5). They are necessary to account for the low H\u03b1 to O i luminosity ratio. Even more energetic shocks may\nionize the molecular gas (arrow number 6). This would bring cold H2 directly into the H ii reservoir.\nTurbulent mixing of hot, warm and cold gas are an alternative mass input of H ii gas. Turbulent mixing\nlayers result from cloud gas shredding into fragments that become too small to survive evaporation due to\nheat conduction (see e.g. Begelman & Fabian, 1990). Turbulent mixing is represented by the thin blue arrow\ntowards the surrouding plasma, to the left of our cartoon. Turbulent mixing produces intermediate temperature\ngas that is thermally instable. This gas cools back to produce H II gas that enters the cycle (thin red arrow).\nIt is relevant to our scenario to note that cold gas in mixing layers probably preserves its dust content. It is\nonly heated to a few 105 K, well below temperatures for which thermal sputtering becomes effective. Further,\nmetals from the dust-free hot plasma that is brought to cool are expected to accrete on dust when gas cools\nand condenses.\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOur understanding of the dynamical interaction between gas phase is inspired by numerical simulations (e.g.\nAudit & Hennebelle 2005) which have changed our perspective on the interstellar medium phases from a static\nto a dynamical picture. The interaction with the hot plasma supplies mechanical energy and momentum to\nthe warm gas as discussed in the context of cold gas observations in clusters by Pope et al. 2008. In our\ninterpretation it is this energy input which drives turbulence and the gas cycle.\nMany galaxy collisions and mergers are observed to trigger IR-luminous bursts of star formation. However,\nthe absence of spectroscopic signatures of photoionization (dust or ionized gas lines) in the center of the SQ\nshock (Xu et al. 2003) show no or little star formation in this region. Our interpretation is that the bulk kinetic\nenergy of the gas colliding flows is not completely dissipated. Within this dynamical understanding of the\npost-shock gas, cold molecular is not a mass sink. The fact that there is no star formation at the centre of the\nshock shows that it is not long-lived enough to allow formation of gravitationally instable molecular fragments.\nWithin a more general framework, interacting H2 luminous galaxies may represent an intermediate phase in the\nevolution of mergers, prior to the starburst.\nReferences\nAppleton, P.
