INTRODUCTION\n\nAs gamma ray bursts (GRBs) occur in the distant universe, their light is susceptible to\ngravitational lensing by intervening matter. In the gamma-ray band, the spatial resolution\nof current detectors is not great enough to allow the detection of individual GRB images, but\nthe microsecond temporal resolution of many GRB detectors might allow for the detection\nof individual images temporally [1].\nThe nature of much of the dark matter in the universe remains unknown. Carr & Rees\n[2] and Gnedin & Ostriker [3] suggested the theoretical possibility that condensates near the\nJean's mass 106.5 M\u2299 could have been the first pregalactic objects, created near the time of\nrecombination in the early universe, with their mass and cosmological density depending on\nconditions. On observational grounds, globular clusters are the oldest objects known, and\ndarker, more compact objects on their mass scale might well have also been created and\nescaped detection [4] [5]. We will refer to these dark matter candidates as Supermassive\nCompact Objects (SCOs).\nPaczynski [6] first suggested the possibility that GRBs could be seen to undergo gravitational lensing. The very short durations of some GRBs make them good sources for the lens\ndetections of SCOs [7], a type of lensing known as millilensing. Previously, Nemiroff et al.\n[8] searched 44 GRBs for millilensing, and the null detection was used to show the universe\nwas not filled to closure density of such lenses [8]. Using the same data, the (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) =\n(0.15, 0.0) cosmology [3] was marginally ruled out Marani et al. [9].\nTo act as a gravitational lens, a SCO must be compact enough to avoid absorbing one of\nthe passing images. Crudely, this means that the lens must be smaller than its own Einstein\nring. For the above canonical mass at a redshift of unity in a smooth (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.70,\n0.30), this radius is about 25 pc. Some massive, compact globular clusters could make good\nmillilenses, but many others would not. Black holes, of course, fit all SCO and millilens\nrequirements.\nIn Section 2, we report the details of a new search for millilensing on 774 GRBs, a\n2\n\n\ffactor of >15 increase in sources over the last published millilensing search [8]. Again, no\nmillilensing candidates were found. In Section 3, we describe the theoretical implications of\nthis null detection in terms of limits on cosmological abundances of SCOs. In Section 4, we\nprovide some discussions and conclusions.\n\nII. THE MILLILENSING SEARCH\n\nSince gravitation does not create a path-dependant time-dilation effect on passing photons, the light-curves of different gravitational lens-induced GRB images are expected to\nbe identical. Similarly, since gravitation deflects photons of different energy equally, the\nspectra of different gravitational lens-induced GRB images are expected to be identical. We\ntherefore search for millilensing by comparing the spectra and the light curves of different\npeaks in the time series of GRBs. The expected time delay between GRB images created\nby a single SCO is [10] [9]\n!\n\n(1 \u2212 f )\n\u221a\n\u2206t = (1 + zl )\n+ lnf RS /c\nf\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere zl is the redshift of the SCO lens, f is the ratio in brightness between the brightest two\nimages and is defined to be less than unity, c is the speed of light, RS is the Schwarzschild\nradius of the SCO lens, and M is the mass of the SCO lens. Note that for canonical values\nlike M = 107 M\u2299 , f = 0.3, and zl = 1.5, the expected time delay between images would be\non the order of 20 seconds.\nThe GRBs we inspected for millilensing were detected by the Burst and Transient Source\nExperiment (BATSE) onboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). This search\nwas the first fully automated search. GRB data were only inspected visually if they passed\nseveral automated millilensing tests. Initial candidates included all GRBs detected between\n1991 April and 1999 January that had 64-ms ASCII data available on-line at the Compton\nGamma Ray Observatory Science Support Center: 1796 GRBs in all. The last GRB investigated was BATSE trigger number 7353. The data typically spanned about up to 524\nseconds.\n3\n\n\fGRBs were eliminated from the candidate millilensing sample if they had any data\ngaps. GRBs with data gaps would likely not show any type of millilensing bias but would\npose special challenges for a program written in a general, automated fashion. Surviving\nGRBs were then eliminated from the candidate millilensing sample if they had backgrounds\nthat sloped by more than 4.5 \u03c3 between the first 64-ms time bin and the last 64-ms time\nbin. Again, these GRBs should show little bias toward millilensing but posed unwieldy\nprogramming challenges. After these cuts 774 GRB millilensing candidates survived.\nThe time series of all surviving GRBs were then analyzed by an automated millilensing\nsearch program: millisearch.for. The program's first task was to isolate the first discrete\nepisode of GRB emission, which we will call the \"burst.\" To start, the highest 64-ms time\nbin of each surviving GRB was first found. This high bin was then added to the very\nnext trailing bin to see if the signal to noise (S/N) above background was increased. If\nnot, the burst was considered to have ended. If so, the trailing bin was considered part of\nthe burst, and added to the burst. The next trailing bin was then considered and treated\nidentically. After the last trailing bin was added to the burst, leading bins were then tested\nand added, again until the S/N over background was found to decrease. At this point, the\nfirst contiguous episode of GRB emission was taken to be defined.\nNext, the program searched to see if a second identical (to within an intensity scale\nfactor), gravitational-lens induced image of the burst could possibly have followed in the\navailable BATSE time series. A candidate emission episode is referred to here as an \"echo.\"\nTo find an echo, the highest 64-ms time-bin following at least one full burst duration after the\nconclusion of the burst was first isolated. A series of 64-ms time bins around the echo peak\nwas then isolated equal to the duration of the burst. GRBs where the echo was below 5.5 \u03c3\nover the background were recorded as having no significant echo. For those GRBs without a\ncandidate echo, maximum echo strength fmax , minimum time delay between burst and echo\ntmin , and maximum time delay between burst and echo tmax were recorded for the analysis\ndescribed in the next section.\nThose GRBs with a candidate echo had fmax recorded as the counts ratio between the\n4\n\n\fecho and the burst. As before tmin and tmax were also recorded for these GRBs. All the\ncounts in all the time bins of the burst and echo were then co-added in all four major BATSE\nenergy channels. The relative counts in each energy channel were compared between burst\nand echo by a two-distribution \u03c72 test. Eleven GRBs passed this test, and were then\ncompared for light-curve similarity. One such candidate is shown in Figure 1. No GRBs\nwere found to have both matching millilensing spectra and light-curves. The final output of\nthe millilensing search program was a list of BATSE trigger numbers, and fmax , tmin , and\ntmax for each trigger.\nFaux GRBs with a fictitious millilensing signal were used to successfully test the millilensing detection program. This program, millisearch.for, is available through the Astrophysics\nSource Code Library at http://ascl.net.\n\nIII. COSMOGONIC IMPLICATIONS\n\nAs millilensing would be expected in a variety of cosmogonic scenarios, non-detection\nrules out some of these scenarios, and sets limits on the potential abundance of SCOs in\nother scenarios. To compute these limits, we used the detection volume formalism [11] [8].\nTo be detectable, lenses must fall inside a volume where they would create two bright images\nwith dynamic range between them fmin . Additionally, lenses must fall inside another volume\nwhere the two bright images would be separated in time by less than a maximum amount\ntmax , and fall outside a third volume where the two bright images would be separated in\ntime by less than a minimum amount tmin .\nAt each lens redshift zl , a detection volume has a radius b. For the detection criterion\nof magnification, the detection volume radius is given in [11] as bA =\n\nq\n\nA\nA\nA\n4RS DOL\nDLS\n\u03a6/DOS\n\nwhere RS is the Schwarzschild radius of the compact lens, D A refers to angular diameter\ndistance, and subscripts O, L, &S refer to the observer, lens and source respectively. Magni\u221a\nfication A is embedded in \u03a6 = A/ A2 \u2212 1 \u2212 1. Dynamic range f between the two brightest\nimages of a compact lens is by definition less than unity and related to total magnification\n5\n\n\fby A = (1 + f )/(1 \u2212 f ). Similarly, the time delay \u2206t between the two brightest images of a\ncompact lens is related to dynamic range by Eqn. 2.1.\nA lens is detectable if it falls inside both bf and btmax but outside btmin . The total number\nof detectable millilenses is therefore given by\nNlens =\n\nZ\n\nzs\n\n0\n\nP\nnl \u03c0(b2outer \u2212 b2inner )dDOL\n\n(3.1)\n\nP\nwhere DOL\nis the proper distance between the observer and the lens, nl is the comoving lens\n\ndensity, bouter is the radius of the outermost detection volume where bouter = min (bf , btmax )\nand binner = btmin .\nIn a few cases, GRB source redshifts zs have been actually determined (see, for example,\n[12]). To find the likely effects of millilensing, however, we needed redshifts for the whole\nBATSE sample. We therefore estimated these redshifts from Monte Carlo simulations. These\nsimulations are described in detail elsewhere [13] [14], and have the following characteristics.\nGRBs are thrown randomly in a universe with a specified geometry. These GRBs are\nassigned a generic spectrum and a peak flux chosen from a published luminosity function\n[15]. These GRBs are then redshifted and re-sampled to see if they would re-trigger BATSE.\nThose that do are fitted to the BATSE 3B detection rate, the BATSE Log N - Log P , timedilation [16] [17], and hV /Vmax i. The later statistic supplemented the normalization of the\nLog N - Log P fit, which was most sensitive to brightness distribution shape. Adjustable free\nparameters included an integrated flux scale factor Lo and a scale factor on the comoving\nnumber density ns . A file recording acceptable fits for each universe geometry was recorded.\nEach of the 774 BATSE millilensing candidates was then matched-up to the Monte-Carlo\nGRB with the closest peak flux, and assigned the redshift of this Monte-Carlo GRB.\nResults are shown for two of these cosmologies in Figures 2 and 3. In the figures, the\nnumber of expected lens detections is plotted as a function of lens mass and density. The\ncontours represent 1, 5, and 10 expected lens detections, and hence roughly correspond to\nexclusions at the 1, 2, and 3 \u03c3 levels.\nThe expected number of lens detections in a (\u03a9M , \u03a9\u039b ) = (0.3, 0.7) universe [18] [19] is\n6\n\n\fshown in Figure 2, on the left. \u03a9M is the density of matter in the universe, relative to the\ncritical density, while \u03a9\u039b is the density in a cosmological constant.\nHere one finds a wide range of masses is excluded for several interesting values of \u03a9CO . In\nfact, \u03a9CO dips below even 0.03 for a narrow range of masses near M/M\u2299 \u223c 107 . Therefore,\neven a significant amount of baryonic dark matter is excluded from forming compact lenses\nin this mass range.\nTo test Gnedin & Ostriker's [3] universe directly, Figure 3, on the right, shows similar\nresults for a (0.15, 0) universe. It appears difficult for any significant fraction of the mass\ndensity to hide in supermassive compact objects in the mass range 106 < M/M\u2299 < 108 .\n\nIV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nLensing of GRBs has the ability to time-resolve a mass range of dark matter not usually\nprobed: that of compact objects near globular cluster mass. That these lenses were not\ndetected indicates, as we have shown above, that the majority of the universe's mass density\ndoes not reside in SCOs.\nA potential inaccuracy in the above analysis lies in the estimated GRB redshifts. The\naverage GRB redshift we have estimated is between 1.5 and 2, like most so far determined in\nthe optical. However, some popular speculation holds that average BATSE redshifts would\nbe higher, and, if true, would make the limits estimated here even more conservative.\nThe above lens rates did not incorporate the potential effects of magnification bias.\nSuch bias [20] would be expected were the GRB luminosity function to rise sharply near the\neffective redshift limit of the BATSE sample. One reason for not including magnification\nbias is the potential uncertainty in the slope of the GRB luminosity function. As including\nmagnification bias might significantly increase the expected amount of lensing, it makes the\nestimated limits derived here even more conservative.\nAnother potential inaccuracy would occur were different GRBs images to have different\nlight-curves or spectra. This might occur were GRBs to undergo beaming [21\u201323] on the\n7\n\n\forder of milli-arcseconds or less, something that has not been ruled out by observation.\nAs more GRBs become available for millilensing inspection, the ability to find a smaller\nand smaller abundance of SCOs becomes possible. Potentially, as much as a factor of 10\nmore GRBs might become available, allowing an abundance as low as \u03a9SCO \u223c 0.003 to be\ndiscernable. A survey sensitive to more GRBs and greater time resolution might detect the\nknown star-field in GRB lensing, as well as dark matter on scales near one solar mass [1].\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was supported, in part, by grants by NASA.
