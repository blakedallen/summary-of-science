This sequence of relations, defined in the\nrange 0 < z < 4, together with average \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) halo mass aggregation histories\n(MAHs) are used here for inferring average Ms growth histories, the Galaxian Hybrid Evolutionary\nTracks (GHETs), where 'hybrid' remarks the combination of observational (Ms ) and theoretical (Mh )\ningredients. As a result of our approach, a unified picture of stellar and halo mass buildup, population\nmigration, and downsizing of galaxies as a function of mass is presented.\nThe inferred average Ms growth histories (GHETs) of highest and lowest mass galaxies are definitively quite different from the average MAHs, Mh (z), of the corresponding dark halos. Depending on\nhow a given Mh (z) compares with the mass at which the Ms -to-Mh ratio curve peaks at the epoch z,\nMhp (z), two evolutionary phases are evidenced: (i) galaxies in an active regime of Ms growth when\nMh < Mhp , and (ii) galaxies in a quiescent or passive regime when Mh > Mhp . The typical Ms at\nwhich galaxies transit from the active (star-forming) to the quiescent regime, Mtran , increases with\nz, log(Mtran/M\u2299 )\u2248 10.30 + 0.55z, making evident a population downsizing phenomenon. This result\nagrees with independent observational determinations based on the evolution of the galaxy stellar\nmass function decomposition into blue and red galaxy populations. The specific star formation rate,\nSSFR, predicted from the derivative of the GHET is consistent with direct measures of the SSFR\nfor galaxies at different redshifts, though both sets of observational inferences are independent. The\naverage GHETs of galaxies smaller than Mtran at z = 0 (Ms \u2248 1010.3 M\u2299 , Mh \u2248 1011.8 M\u2299 ) did not\nreach the quiescent regime, and for them, the lower the mass, the faster the later Ms growth rate\n(downsizing in SSFR). The GHETs allow us to predict the transition rate in the number density of\nactive to passive population; the predicted values agree with direct estimates of the growth rate in the\nnumber density for the (massive) red population up to z \u223c 1. We show that \u039bCDM\u2013based models\nof disk galaxy evolution, including feedback-driven outflows, are able to reproduce the low-mass side\nof the Ms \u2013Mh relation at z \u223c 0, but at higher z \u2032 s strongly disagree with the GHETs: models do not\nreproduce the strong downsizing in SSFR and the high SSFR of low mass galaxies.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: haloes - galaxies: highredshift - galaxies: star formation\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nAccording to the popular hierarchical clustering \u039b\nCold Dark Matter (\u039bCDM) scenario, galaxies form and\ngrow inside evolving dark matter haloes. A central question emerges then about what is the galaxy stellar mass,\nMs , associated on average with a given halo of mass Mh ,\ni.e., the Ms \u2013Mh relation. The change with redshift of\nthis relation, Ms (Mh ,z), resumes the key astrophysical\nprocesses of galaxy stellar mass assembly in the context\nof the \u039bCDM scenario.\nWith the advent of large galaxy surveys in the last\nyears, a big effort has been made in constraining the\nlocal Ms \u2013Mh relation (1) directly by estimating halo\nmasses with galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with kinematics\nof satellite galaxies or with X-ray studies; and (2) indirectly by linking the observed statistical galaxy properties (e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function GSM F , the\nElectronic address: firmani@merate.mi.astro.it,avila@astro.unam.mx\n1 Also Instituto de Astronom\u0131\u0301a, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma\nde M\u00e9xico, A.P. 70-264, 04510, M\u00e9xico, D.F., M\u00e9xico\n\ntwo\u2013point correlation function, galaxy group catalogs) to\nthe theoretical Halo Mass Function (hereafter HM F ; for\nrecent reviews on all of these methods see Moster et al.\n2010; Behroozi et al. 2010; More et al. 2010, and more\nreferences in these papers). The latter approach is less\ndirect than the former one, but it allows to cover larger\nmass ranges, and it can be extended up to the redshifts\nwhere observed GSM F s are reported (for recent results\nsee Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Moster et al. 2010; Wang\n& Jing 2010; Behroozi et al. 2010).\nIn Moster et al. (2010) and Behroozi et al. (2010;\nhereafter BCW10), the Ms (Mh ,z) functionality has been\nconstrained up to z \u2248 4. In each case, different observational data sets for the GSM F s and different methods\nfor statistically assigning halo masses to the galaxies were\nused. The Ms \u2013Mh relation at z \u223c 0 is similar in both\nworks (see also Baldry et al. 2008; Drory et al. 2009; Guo\net al. 2010; Wang & Jing 2010). However, the change\n>\nwith z of this relation, Ms (Mh ,z), particularly for z \u223c\n1,\nis different in both cases.\nAlthough the uncertainties in the inferences of\n\n\f2\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\nMs (Mh ,z) are still significant, the current determinations can be used for preliminary explorations of the\ngalaxy mass assembly process. An original approach has\nbeen introduced by Conroy & Wechsler (2009; hereafter\nCW09), who proposed a parametric form for GSM F as\nfunction of z constrained by both some observational reports of this function and the star formation rate (SFR)\u2013\nMs relations to z \u223c 1. Then, the cumulative GSM F s\nat each z were matched to the cumulative HM F s in order to infer the Ms \u2013Mh relations at different z \u2032 s (abundance matching formalism, the simplest of the indirect\nmethods; e.g., Marinoni & Hudson 2002, Kravtsov et al.\n2004, Vale & Ostriker 2004; see \u00a72). Finally, the obtained Ms \u2013Mh relations at different z \u2032 s were connected\nby using simple parameterizations of the average halo\nmass aggregation histories (MAHs) in order to infer the\naverage stellar mass buildup of galaxies as a function of\nmass.\nThe previous approach has the advantage (1) of being flexible enough as to allow for explorations covering large mass and redshift ranges, and (2) of providing\na bridge between observational results and theoretical\nwork. One of the bases of this approach is the statistical\nabundance matching formalism, which has shown to give\nrobust results in agreement with direct inferences of the\nlocal Ms \u2013Mh relation or with other indirect inferences\nbased on observations of the two-point correlation functions or galaxy group catalogs (see Moster et al. 2010;\nBCW10; More et al. 2010; Dutton et al. 2010a).\nFrom the purely empirical point of view, recent studies are posing a new conception in our understanding of\ngalaxy stellar mass assembly. For example, Drory & Alvarez (2008) used empirical GSM F s up to z \u223c 5 (Drory\net al. 2005) to infer the Ms assembly of large galaxies,\nand in combination with available observations of the\nSFR\u2013Ms relation at different z \u2032 s, they constrained the\ncontribution of star formation (SF) and merging to stellar mass build up in galaxies. From this and other studies (e.g., Bundy et al. 2006,2009; Hopkins et al. 2007;\nPozzetti et al. 2010), the trend of downsizing (Cowie\net al. 1996) is clearly shown in the sense that the mass\nat which the SFR starts to drop strongly decreases with\ntime (from Ms \u223c 1012 M\u2299 at z > 4 to Ms \u223c 1010.9 M\u2299\nat z \u223c 0.5 according to Drory & Alvarez 2008). This result combined with observationally inferred merger rates,\nled the latter authors to conclude that the (massive)\nred sequence is built up from top to down. This phenomenon was originally dubbed as 'archaeological downsizing' (Thomas et al. 2005; see also for related results\ne.g., Daddi et. al 2004,2007; Drory et al. 2004; Bundy\net al. 2005,2006; Conselice et al. 2007; Marchesini et\nal. 2009; Perez-Gonzalez et al. 2008 and more references\ntherein), and it seems that its main driver are internal\ngalaxy processes that efficiently quench SF in massive\ngalaxies (e.g., Bundy et al. 2006; Peng et al. 2010).\nThe latter result has been confirmed by recent decompositions of the GSM F by galaxy type (based on color,\nSFR, morphology, etc.) up to z \u223c 1 (e.g., Borch et al.\n2006; Bell et al. 2007; Drory et al. 2009; Ilbert et al.\n2010; Pozzetti et al. 2010; for a compilation of early observations, see Hopkins et al. 2007). A systematic result\nobtained in these works is that blue/late-type (active)\ngalaxies migrate to the red/early-type (passive) population involving a sequence of masses that decreases with\n\ntime, a result in line with the archaeological downsizing\nphenomenon. The environment plays also an important\nrole. Recent observational studies, where the GSM F has\nbeen divided not only by galaxy types but also by environment, show that the population migration happens\nmore efficiently and earlier in denser environments (e.g.,\nPeng et al. 2010).\nAt lower masses the inferences of the Ms assembly are\ndifficulted by the incompleteness limit of the samples as\n<\nhigher is z. However, at least for z \u223c\n1, current studies\nshow that the specific SFR (SSFR) of low-mass (blue)\ngalaxies is surprisingly high, and higher than the SSFRs\nof more massive galaxies (e.g., Bauer et al. 2005; Noeske\net al. 2007; Zheng et al. 2007; Bell et al 2007; Elbaz\net al. 2007; Chen et al. 2009; Damen et al. 2009a,b;\nSantini et al. 2009; Oliver et al. 2010; Rodighiero et al.\n2010). This 'downsizing in SSFR' of low-mass galaxies\nseems to imply a delayed Ms buildup as lower is the\nmass, something difficult to explain by the moment in\n\u039bCDM-based models (for models, discussions, and more\nreferences see Noeske et al. 2007; Fontanot et al. 2009;\nFirmani, Avila-Reese & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Puebla 2010).\nBased on the \u039bCDM scenario and the new observational inferences discussed above, a unified picture of\nstellar and halo mass buildup of galaxies of all sizes can\nbe developed. By using Ms \u2013Mh relations constrained\nby BCW10 from z \u2248 0 to 4, we generate an analytical\nMs (Mh ,z) relationship, which is continuous and differentiable at any z. This sequence of Ms \u2013Mh relations in z\nis combined with average halo MAHs in order to:\n1. calculate the average stellar mass buildup tracks of\ngalaxies, Ms (z), from z = 4 up to now (hereafter,\ngalaxian hybrid evolutionary tracks, GHETs) along\nwith their halo MAHs, Mh (z);\n2. calculate the average SSFR histories of galaxies\nfrom the corresponding specific stellar mass growth\nrate histories, \u1e40s (z)/Ms (z);\n3. determine the typical mass Mtran at each z that\nmarks the transition from active to passive galaxy\npopulation (in terms of Ms growth)\n4. infer the transition rate in the number density of\nactive to passive galaxies at each z.\nOur approach differs from CW09 in several aspects.\nThese authors used observational inferences of the SSFR\nvs Ms at different z \u2032 s for constraining the evolution of\ntheir proposed GSM F (up to z \u223c 1), which is a partial input of their approach for calculating Ms (Mh ,z).\nInstead, we use more recent and updated direct constraints for this relationship (BCW10), which extends\nup to z \u2248 4, and then predict the SSFR histories. In\nCW09 a simple parameterization for the average MAHs\nwas used, while we generate them by using an extended\nPress-Schechter formalism that gives results similar to\nthose of large N-body cosmological simulations. We differ from CW09 also in several aims and results.\nThe inferences of the quantities listed above constrain\nin general the multiple astrophysical processes participating in the formation and evolution of galaxies. In particular, we will compare the inferred evolutionary tracks\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\n(GHETs) to predictions of standard \u039bCDM-based seminumerical models of disk galaxy evolution and explore\nwhether the so-called downsizing in SSFR is really an\nissue for models.\nIn \u00a72, the method to calculate the GHETs is explained.\nThe inferred average GHETs are presented in different\ndiagrams in \u00a73. In \u00a7\u00a73.1 and 3.2 the evolution of the\nSSFR as a function of mass, the evolution of the transition mass Mtran , and the flow of active to passive galaxies at each epoch, are shown and compared with direct\nobservational estimates. The reliability of our approach\nand the results are discussed in \u00a73.3. In \u00a74, \u039bCDM-based\nmodels of disk galaxy evolution are used to calculate evolutionary tracks for low-mass galaxies and see whether\nthey are able to reproduce or not the GHETs, in particular the SSFR downsizing phenomenon. A summary\nand our conclusions are given in \u00a75.\n2. THE METHOD\n\nOur inference of the galaxy stellar mass buildup as a\nfunction of mass (called here GHETs) consists of two\nmain steps: (1) we find an analytical functionality for\nMs (Mh ,z), and (2) after generating the halo MAHs,\nMh (z), we combine them with Ms (Mh ,z) to infer the\nGHETs, Ms (z).\n2.1. The Stellar Mass\u2013Halo Mass Relations at\nDifferent Redshifts\nOur starting point is the determination of Ms (Mh ,z)\nup to the highest redshift as possible. As mentioned\nin Section 1, such a relationship has been recently constrained up to z \u223c 4 by using the statistical formalism of\nmatching one-to-one the cumulative theoretical \u039bCDM\nHM F to the observed cumulative GSM F at different\nz \u2032 s: nh (> Mh ) = ng (> Ms ) (e.g., Moster et al. 2010;\nBCW10). Here we will use the results from BCW10,\nwho started from an assumed parametric expression for\nMs (Mh ,z) and explored the parameter space, including\nuncertainties and sample variance, with a Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain technique to fit jointly the GSM F s observed at different z \u2032 s (they actually carried out this\n<\n<\nanalysis separately for two redshift ranges: 0 \u223c\nz\u223c\n1 and\n<\n<\n1 \u223c z \u223c 4). The authors have estimated and carefully taken\ninto account all kind of uncertainties, which introduce\nsignificant scatter in the Ms \u2013Mh relations and affect even\nthe shape of these relations (see \u00a7\u00a73.3 for a discussion).\nThe observational input used in BCW10 is the total\nlocal GSM F obtained in Li & White (2009) from Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and the total GSM F s\nat higher redshifts (up to \u223c 4) homogeneously obtained\nin P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2008). For the halo mass function, BCW10 used the results from N-body cosmological\nsimulations by Tinker et al. (2008). Since these HM F s\nrefer only to distinct halos, a correction by the sub-halo\nabundance was introduced (see details in BCW10). The\nmass of the subhalo is fixed as that one at the time of accretion into the halo, Macc , but the satellite galaxy's Ms\nis associated with the current GSM F , i.e., it is implicitly\nassumed that the satellite's Ms will continue to evolve in\nthe same way as for centrals of halo mass Macc (the effect\nof fixing instead the satellite mass Ms at the redshift of\naccretion has virtually no effect on the overall Ms \u2013Mh\nrelation as checked in BCW10). Thus, the Ms (Mh ,z)\n\n3\n\nrelationship used here refers to the overall galaxy population at each epoch, and this includes satellite galaxies, though under the assumptions mentioned above for\nthis sub-population. On the one hand, there are some\nhints that the Ms \u2013Mh relation of only satellite galaxies\nshould not differ significantly from the overall relation\n(Wang et al. 2006). On the other hand, satellites are\nnot a dominant population at any epoch, in particular\nat high redshifts. Therefore, even if its Ms \u2013Mh relation\nis quite peculiar, its effect over the average Ms \u2013Mh relation is expected to be negligible. For more details on\nthe assumptions and role of uncertainties in the inference\nof the Ms (Mh ,z) relationship we refer the reader to the\noriginal work by BCW10 (see also \u00a7\u00a73.3).\nIt is worth mentioning that BCW10 refer to their Ms \u2013\nMh relations as corresponding to \"central\" galaxies. This\nshould be understood in the sense that for each (sub)halo\nis considered only the Ms of one galaxy, the central one,\nbut not in the sense that the satellite galaxy population has been excluded from the analysis (see above). A\n(sub)halo may contain more galaxies besides the central\none (satellites). Therefore, the total stellar mass within\nthe (sub)halo will be larger if we account for satellites.\nIn BCW10 it was shown that the inclusion of satellites\nresults in a \"total\" Ms /Mh ratio sligthly larger than the\n\"central\" one at small masses but significantly larger at\nhigh (group and cluster) masses (BCW10; see also Yang,\nMo & van den Bosch 2009). Some of this \"excess\" stellar mass is expected to end actually in the central galaxy\ndue to satellite infall and/or tidal stripping of stars (other\nfractions of this stellar mass may end in the stellar halo\nor remain in the surviving satellites); this could modify\nthe obtained overall Ms \u2013Mh relation2 . In general, we do\nnot expect that the overall Ms \u2013Mh relations inferred by\nBCW10 will be significantly affected by the (unknown)\n13\nphysics of satellite galaxies, at least for Mh <\nM\u2299 at\n\u223c 10\nany epoch, and for any mass at z >> 0.\nFigure 1 shows the Ms -to-Mh ratio as a function of\nMh at z = 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 reported in BCW10\n(solid, dashed, dot-dashed, dot-dot-dashed, and dotdashed-dashed lines) with the respective 1\u03c3 uncertainties\n(error bars, showed only for z = 0.1, 2, and 4). Several\nfeatures regarding galaxy mass assembly can be anticipated from this figure:\n1) In the 0 \u2264 z \u2264 4 range the peak of the curves shifts\nfrom log(Mhp/M\u2299 )\u223c 11.8 to 12.5, while log(Ms /Mh )p\nfirst declines from \u22121.5 at z \u2248 0 to \u22121.7 at z \u2248 2, and\nthen recovers the value \u22121.5 at z \u2248 4. Taking into account the uncertainty, the shape of the relations is conserved. Around log(Mh /M\u2299 )\u223c 12.5\u00b10.3 the curves cross\neach other.\n2) On the left side of the diagram, below the crossing\nmasses (in particular from z = 1 to z = 0.1), for a given\nMh , the Ms -to-Mh ratio increases as z decreases, which\nreveals a strong late growth of Ms for individual galaxies.\n2 According to the analysis of Yang et al. (2009), for halos\n13 h\u22121 M\nsmaller than Mh <\n\u2299 at z \u223c 0, the mass fraction of\n\u223c 10\nstars accreted by the central galaxy is negligible, indicating that\nthe latter cannot have grown substantially due to the accretion of\nsatellite galaxy's stars; rather their growth is dominated by individual evolution (in situ SF). For halos larger than Mh \u2248 1013\nh\u22121 M\u2299 , the central galaxy Ms may increase lately in a significant\nfraction by satellite accretion (dry mergers); another fraction of\nthe accreted stars end in the stellar halo (intracluster stars).\n\n\f4\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\nFig. 1.- Ms /Mh vs. Mh relations at z = 0.1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 from BCW10 with the respective uncertainties. The brown arrow shows the\nevolution of a passive galaxy (constant Ms ) from z = 4, where its initial conditions coincide with the corresponding isochrone, to z = 0.\nThe fact that such arrow reaches the z = 0 isochrone shows that at these high masses galaxies evolve passively (see the text). The Ms \u2013Mh\nrelations given by the Ms (Mh ,z) relationship proposed here are represented by dotted lines with the same color code as the BCW10 curves.\n\nHence, this side is expected to be populated mainly by\nactively growing (blue) galaxies.\n3) Just the opposite happens on the right side, above\nthe crossing masses, which means that for individual\ngalaxies, Ms brakes its growth while Mh continues growing. To illustrate this point, we plot in Fig. 1 the evolution (brown arrow) of a completely passive galaxy of\nconstant mass Ms \u2248 1011.35 that starts in the isochrone\nz = 4 with Mh = 1013 M\u2299 and evolves until Mh grows to\n\u2248 1013.9 M\u2299 at z = 0 according to a typical \u039bCDM MAH\n(see \u00a7\u00a72.2) for this mass. If the galaxies of the sample\nthat allow us to find the isochrones would be growing\nin Ms , then the arrow would diverge from the z = 0\nisochrone. Therefore, the fact that the arrow reaches\nthe z = 0 isochrone exactly reveals that this side of the\ndiagram is dominated by galaxies with passive evolution.\nThe previous considerations confirm the idea that\nMs (Mh ,z) resumes the key astrophysical processes of\ngalaxy stellar mass assembly and therefore it contains information about the evolution of individual galaxies. Our\naim now is to explore the implications of the Ms (Mh ,z)\nrelations shown in Fig. 1. As we are interested in the\nproperties of Ms (z) up to its second derivative (SSFR\nand the rate of change of SSFR), we cannot use the double parameterization in z given by BCW10 in the ranges\n0 < z < 1 and 1 < z < 4, respectively, because discontinuities arise around z = 1. Then, starting from the\ndata of Fig. 1, we introduce a modified parameterization\nthat is continuous in z. The following equations, adapted\nfrom BCW10, summarize the model to be used here for\n\n0 < z < 4:\nlog(Mh (Ms )) =\nlog(M1 ) + \u03b2 log\n\n\u0012\n\nMs\nMs ,0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\u03b4\nMs\nMs ,0\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011\u03b3 \u2212 . (1)\n+\nM\n,0\n2\ns\n1+ M\ns\n\u0012\n\nThe dependence on z is introduced in the parameters of\nequation (1) as:\nlog(M1 (a)) = M1,0 + M1,a (a \u2212 1),\nlog(Ms ,0 (a)) = Ms ,0,0 + Ms ,0,a (a \u2212 1) + \u03c7 (z) ,\n\u03b2(a) = \u03b20 + \u03b2a (a \u2212 1),\n\u03b4(a) = \u03b40 + \u03b4a (a \u2212 1),\n\u03b3(a) = \u03b30 + \u03b3a (a \u2212 1),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a = 1/(1+z) is the scale factor. The function \u03c7 (z)\ncontrols the change with z of the peak value (ordinate)\nof the curves in Fig. 1. If \u03c7 (z) = 0, then the curve peak\nordinate is independent of z. We chose \u03c7 (z) in order\nto reproduce roughly the evolution of the peak found in\nBCW10. The first two Eqs. (2) control the position of\nthe Ms /Mh peak at each z (the value of Mhp [z]), while\nthe last three ones control the shape of the Ms /Mh \u2013Mh\ncurves. We fix the parameters in Eqs. (1) and (2) expecting (i) to reproduce well the BCW10 (Ms /Mh )\u2013Mh\nrelations at the redshift extremes (z \u2248 0 and z \u2248 4, see\nFig. 1), (ii) to keep the generated relations at all z \u2032 s\nwithin the 1\u03c3 uncertainty given in BCW10, and (iii) to\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\n\n3.

The dark halo mass aggregation history (MAH)\nThe Ms (Mh ,z) relationship proposed in the previous\nsection allows us to transform an average dark halo\nMAH, Mh (z), into an average stellar mass growth history, Ms (Mh (z),z) (the GHET). Instead of using a parameterization for the average MAHs as was done in\nCW09, here we calculate them by using the special Extended Press-Schechter formalism developed in AvilaReese, Firmani & Hern\u00e1ndez (1998, see also Firmani &\nAvila-Reese 2000). Under the assumption that the primordial density field is Gaussian, we calculate the overall\nmass distribution of progenitor halos at a given epoch\nzi+1 that will be contained in a halo of mass Mi at a\nlater epoch zi . Thus, after defining the cosmology and\nthe mass power spectrum of fluctuations (as in BCW10,\nparameters very close to WMAP5 are used here, Komatsu et al. 2009), we start from a given mass at a given\ntime (e.g., z = 0) and calculate its mass distribution of\nprogenitors at a previous time step through Monte Carlo\ntrials. The mass of the most massive halo (main progenitor) is used as the conditional for the next time step\nand so on. This way is obtained one realization of the\nMAH. For each Mh given at z = 0, we calculate 20000\nrandom tracks (MAHs) and then we average among them\nto get the average MAH for this mass. In spite of the\nstochasticity, the MAHs present a systematical (hierarchical) trend with mass: the smaller is Mh (z = 0), the\nearlier is its mass assembly on average (Avila-Reese et\nal. 1998; van den Bosch 2002; Wechsler et al. 2002).\nOur average MAHs are not easy to describe by a simple\nparametrization, but they are in good agreement with\nthose measured in the outcome of cosmological N-body\nsimulations (e.g., Fakhouri, Ma, & Boylan-Kolchin 2010).\n\nEVOLUTIONARY TRACKS\nThe GHETs in the Ms vs. Mh diagram, calculated as\nexplained in \u00a72, are plotted with red thin solid lines in\nFigure 2. The blue dashed curves show the Ms \u2013Mh relations for z = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 from top to bottom (bottom\nto top) on the left (right) side. The GHETs in Figure\n2 start from the z = 4 relation and end at the z = 0\none. Two features of the GHETs in such a diagram are\nremarkable. (1) Below log(Mh /M\u2299 )\u223c 11.6 the average\nslopes of the GHETs are dlogMs /dlogMh\u223c 4.5, greater\nthan the slopes dlogMs /dlogMh\u223c 2.3 of the Ms \u2013Mh relations in their low-mass side at any z. (2) The GHETs of\nmassive halos (log(Mh /M\u2299 ) >\n\u223c 12 at z = 0) stop to grow,\nhappening this earlier, the more massive are the galaxies. Such a behavior is due to the folding seen in the\nMs \u2013Mh-z surface that inverts the spatial distribution of\nthe Ms (Mh ,z) curves going from the left to the right side\nof the diagram. The same properties may be derived\nfrom Figure 3, where the GHETs are shown as tracks\nthat connect the Ms /Mh\u2013Mh relations. Here the folding\nis seen in the blue dashed lines as a maximum that shifts\nto the higher\u2013mass side as z increases, making the lines\ncross each other. Both figures help to understand why\nthe GHETs of massive halos attain a maximum.\nThe GHETs ending at z = 0 with masses\n8.4 \u2264log(Ms /M\u2299 ) \u2264 11.6 are plotted with red solid lines\nin Figure 4. The corresponding halo average MAHs are\nalso plotted but, for comparative reasons, each one has\nbeen shifted vertically in such a way that each MAH coincides with its related GHET at z = 0 (blue dashed lines).\nThis figure shows in detail the difference between the average stellar and the halo evolutionary track shapes. For\nMs (z=0)< 1010.5 M\u2299 , each GHET grows faster than the\ncorresponding MAH since z = 4. For Ms (z=0)> 1010.5\nM\u2299 , as the system is more massive, the stellar assembly of the galaxy occurs earlier in time with respect to\nthe corresponding halo. Our analysis shows conclusively\nthat the stellar mass growth of galaxies deviates from\nthe halo mass growth, specially for low- and high-mass\nsystems.\nFigures 2 and 3 show that the more massive the galaxies, the earlier their GHETs start to slow down their\nMs growth and at each epoch there is a typical halo or\ngalaxy mass at which this growth stagnates; this typical mass decreases with time. Such a situation can be\ninterpreted as a transition at each epoch from active to\npassive galaxy populations, a transition at early epochs\nhappens only for the largest galaxies but at later epochs\ninvolves gradually smaller galaxies (see \u00a7\u00a73.2 for a more\nquantitative discussion).\nThis transition from active to passive regimes is observed in the evolution of the blue and red components of\nthe GSM F . In fact, observations show directly that, despite the stellar mass growth, the blue (late-type) galaxy\ncomponent of the GSM F is not enriched with massive\ngalaxies with time; on the contrary, within the uncertainty, it seems to become poorer in massive galaxies\n(e.g., Bundy et al. 2006; Bell et al. 2007; Pozzetti et\nal. 2010). Such a phenomenon is explained by a migration of galaxies from the blue to the red component of\nthe GSM F ; the red (early-type) galaxy component of\nthe GSM F is continuously fed with the migrated galax-\n\n\f6\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\nFig. 2.- The Ms \u2013Mh relations (blue dashed lines) at z = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, from top to bottom (bottom to top) in the left (right) side,\nrespectively, and the inferred average GHETs displayed from z = 4 to z = 0 (red thin solid lines). The lower and upper dotted curves\nare model predictions for the evolution of two disk galaxies that end today with log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.40 and 10.15, respectively (see \u00a74 for\ndetails). From right to left, the crosses correspond to z = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nies. Our result, in the light of such an interpretation,\nis remarkable because in our analysis the galaxy color\nbi-modality never has been taken into account. Studies\nwhere the GSM F s were decomposed into blue and red\npopulations support our result in an independent way\n(e.g., Bell et al. 2007; Drory et al. 2009; Pozzetti et al.\n2010).\nNote that the prediction of a population transition and\nthe typical mass that separates the two populations at\neach z depends on the position of the folding in the Ms \u2013\nMh \u2013z surface. This feature reveals a fundamental aspect\nof the GSM F evolution. Therefore, the accurate study\nof this feature deserves maximum efforts from the observational point of view.\nThe fact that the more massive are the systems, the\nearlier they finish their Ms assembling, transiting from\nthe active to the passive population, will be called here\npopulation downsizing (in the literature the term 'archaeological downsizing' has been used to describe a related\nbehavior of galaxies; see e.g., Fontanot et al. 2009, and\nthe references therein).\nFor systems less massive than Ms \u2248 1010.5 M\u2299 at z = 0\n(Mh \u2248 1012 M\u2299 ), the active (growing) phase continues\nstill at z = 0 on average (the population downsizing has\nnot happened), and the smaller is the system, the Ms\ngrowth is more delayed and concentrated towards the\npresent. The fact that the less massive is the system,\n\nthe later happens its active phase of Ms assembling, is\ncalled downsizing in SSFR (see e.g., Fontanot et al. 2009,\nFirmani et al. 2010 and the references therein).\nIn the different diagrams plotted in Figures 2, 3,\nand 4, we have introduced the corresponding evolutionary tracks (crosses at z = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected\nwith dotted lines) for two (low\u2013mass) galaxies calculated by means of a \u039bCDM\u2013based model of galaxy evolution which will be explained in detail in \u00a74. Their final stellar masses are log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.4 and 10.1, respectively. We anticipate the rather different behavior\nof the model 'galaxian evolutionary tracks' (hereafter\nGETs) with respect to the GHETs. For example, the\naverage slope of the former in the Ms \u2013Mh diagram is\ndlogMs /dlogMh=1.4, much less than the slopes of any\nGHET, and also less than the lower limit estimated above\nfor the low\u2013mass side of the Ms \u2013Mh relations at each z.\nThis means that the model isochrones (defined by connecting crosses of a given z) have a distribution and evolution opposite to that of the empirical Ms \u2013Mh relations.\n3.1. Stellar mass growth rates as a function of mass\nThe stellar mass buildup of galaxies may happen due\nto in situ SF or accretion of stars, mainly in dry merger\nevents. Several theoretical (e.g., Maller et al. 2006;\nGuo & White 2008), semi-empirical (Zheng, Coil Zehavi 2007; CW09; Yang, Mo & van den Bosch 2009;\nWang & Jing 2010), and observational (e.g., Bundy et\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\n\n7\n\nFig. 3.- Same as in Fig. 2 but for the Ms -to-Mh ratio.\n\nFig. 4.- Average GHETs (red solid lines) and the corresponding halo average MAHs (violet dot-dashed lines); for comparison\npurposes, each one of the latter ones was shifted vertically in such\na way that Mh (z=0) = Ms (z=0). The lower and upper dotted\ncurves are model predictions for the evolution of two disk galaxies\nthat end today with log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.40 and 10.15, respectively\n(see \u00a74 for details).\n\nal. 2006,2009; Bell et al. 2007; Drory & Alvarez 2008)\npieces of evidence show that the former channel completely dominates in low- and intermediate-mass galaxies\nat all epochs, while the latter may play a moderate role\n\nFig. 5.- Evolution of the SSFR (see text for its definition)\ncorresponding to the same GHETs shown in Figure 4 (solid red\nlines). From top to bottom, the curves with thick solid lines connect the tracks at the moment log(Ms /M\u2299 ) equal to 9.5 (blue),\n10 (cyan), 10.5 (green), and 11.0 (red), respectively. The upper\nand lower black curves are model predictions for the evolution of\ntwo disk galaxies that end today with log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.4 and 10.1,\nrespectively (see \u00a74 for details).\n11\nfor massive (Ms >\nM\u2299 , mainly red) galaxies at later\n\u223c 10\n<\nepochs (z \u223c 1).\nAs a working hypothesis, we will assume that the stel-\n\n\f8\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\nlar mass buildup implied by our derived average GHETs\nis only due to in situ SF. Therefore, we calculate the\nSSFR as the time derivative of Ms (z) divided by the current mass, \u1e40s (z)/Ms (z), and divided by (1 \u2212 R), where\nR = 0.4 is the gas recycling factor due to stellar mass\nloss. The obtained SSFRs are then compared with directly observed SSFRs as a function of Ms and z.\nIn Figure 5, the evolution of the GHET-based SSFR is\nplotted (red solid line) for the same cases shown in Figure\n4. From top to bottom, the mass of the GHETs increases,\nexcept for the minor inversion (track crossing) present in\nthe top right side of the diagram. For all the masses,\nSSFR decreases as z decreases. The overall behavior of\ndecreasing SSFR with time agrees, by construction, with\nthe known direct observational inferences of the cosmic\nstellar mass density history and its time derivative (e.g.,\nDrory et al. 2005; P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2008), providing\na comparison term to the observed cosmic SFR density\nhistory (Madau et al. 1996; see Hopkins & Beacom 2006\nfor an extensive compilation of observational inferences).\nWe test now if the GHET-based SSFRs histories as a\nfunction of mass are in agreement with the direct observational measures. The observations of course do not\nrefer to individual evolutionary tracks. What observers\ndo is to determine the SSFRs of galaxy samples in different redshift bins. A commonly reported result is the\naverage of the SSFR in different z bins corresponding to\na given range of Ms (the same at all z's). In Figures 5\nand 6, from top to down, the thick (cyan, blue, green,\nand red) lines correspond to the SSFR inferred from the\nGHETs that in each z have log(Ms /M\u2299 )=9.5, 10.0, 10.5,\nand 11.0, respectively.\nIn Figure 6, we reproduce averages of SSFR observational estimates at different z's for galaxies in four\nMs bins (centered in the same masses plotted for the\nGHETs). These estimates were taken for z \u223c 0 from\nSalim et al. (2007) excluding galaxies with AGN, and\nfor higher z's (until z \u223c 1), from Bell et al. (2007; only\ntheir Chandra Deep Field South estimates are plotted\nhere). The data used to get these estimates refer to the\npopulation of blue (star-forming) galaxies (see Firmani\net al. 2010 for more details on the choice of the observational data). It should be stressed that the intrinsic\nspread around the plotted curves is rather large.\nFor the largest mass bin (Ms about 1011 M\u2299 , lower red\ncurves), the GHETs imply clearly lower SSFRs than the\ndirectly measured SSFRs of star\u2013forming (blue) galax<\nies at z \u223c\n1. This is expected since, as discussed above,\nthe most massive galaxies show evidence to have early\ntransited to the passive population. For the galaxy mass\nMs \u2248 1011 M\u2299 , the transit to the passive, red sequence\nhappens at z \u2248 1.3 (see Fig. 8 below) as indicated by\na vertical mark over the curve. Bell et al. (2007) reported the estimated SSFRs also for the red sequence\ngalaxies. Their estimates for Ms \u223c 1011 M\u2299 (red circles)\nand 1010.5 M\u2299 (green circles) are plotted in Figure 6.\nThe directly measured SSFRs of massive (red) galaxies\nare very low, decreasing their values as z decreases in\nthe same manner as our predictions show. While speculative by the moment due to the large uncertainties, the\nfact that the values of our inferred SSFRs are systematically higher than the direct measures of red massive\ngalaxies could be interpreted as an evidence of contribu-\n\nFig. 6.- Same curves connecting the GHETs at four values\nof Ms =constant (indicated inside the panel) as shown in Figure 5\n(solid thick lines).

(2007) for their sample\nof blue galaxies; in both cases the (average) masses are the same\nas the GHET-based masses. The filled circles are also inferences\nfrom Bell et al. but for their sample of red galaxies and only\nfor log(Ms /M\u2299 )= 11.0 (red filled circles) and 10.5 (green filled\ncircles). The vertical marks over the log(Ms /M\u2299 )= 11.0 and 10.5\ncurves indicate the typical redshift at which these masses transit\nfrom active to passive phases. Note that the end of the 1011 M\u2299\nGHET\u2013based curve (when these masses are already in the passive\nphase) agrees well with the SSFR of red rather than blue galaxies;\nthe end of the 1010.5 M\u2299 GHET\u2013based curve is in between the\nred and blue galaxy samples.

(2009a) presented estimates of\nthe SSFR up to z \u2248 2.8 for massive galaxies (Ms > 1010.5\nM\u2299 ) in the same Chandra Deep Field South used in Bell\n>\net al. (2007). As mentioned above, for redshifts z \u223c\n1\n11\ngalaxies of Ms \u2248 10 M\u2299 or smaller are on average in\ntheir active (SF-driven) growth regime. The results by\nDamen et al. are in rough agreement at these redshifts\nwith our predictions. If any, the GHET-based SSFRs are\nslightly lower than the averages of the directly measured\nSSFRs.\nFor the intermediate mass bin (Ms \u2248 1010.5 M\u2299 , green\ncurves), the agreement between the average SSFRs inferred from the GHETs and those measured directly for\nthe star-forming (blue) galaxies (Bell et al. 2007) is satisfactory, given the spread of data in SSFR. If any, the\nSSFR from the GHETs is slightly lower, in particular at\nlow z \u2032 s. Again, due to the population downsizing, active (blue) galaxies of masses Ms \u2248 1010.5 M\u2299 transit to\nthe passive (red) population at z \u2248 0.35 (see Fig. 8)\nas indicated by the mark over the green curve, so that\ntheir SSFRs at lower z's should be in between those measured for the blue and red sequences. The agreement in\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\n\nFig. 7.- Same GHETs as shown in Figure 4 but in the SSFR\nvs Ms (z) diagram (thin solid red lines). From bottom to top, the\ncurves with thick solid lines connect the tracks at a given epoch\n(isochrones): z =0 (cyan), 1 (blue), 2 (green), 3 (orange), and 4\n(red), respectively. The red crosses indicate the points where the\nGHET slope declines below -5. The lower and upper dotted curves\nare model predictions for the evolution of two disk galaxies that\nend today with log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.40 and 10.15, respectively (see \u00a74\nfor details).\n\nthe mass range around 1010.5 M\u2299 with the Damen et\nal. (2009a) observational inferences up to z \u2248 2.8 is also\ngood, though the samples of these authors do not separate galaxies in early- and late-type ones. For z > 0.5 the\nslope of the SSFR(Ms \u2248 1010.5 M\u2299 )\u2013(1 + z) relation for\nour prediction and for direct observations is about 3.3.\nFor the lowest mass bins (Ms \u223c 1010.0 and 109.5 M\u2299 ,\nblue and cyan curves), the agreement between GHETpredicted and directly-measured SSFRs is reasonable if\ntakes into account (i) the large intrinsic spread of the observational inferences (1\u03c3 width of \u223c 0.5 dex around the\nmean in the relation log(SSFR)\u2013logMs at z \u223c 0, Salim et\nal. 2007; for higher redshifts, the typical reported intrinsic 1\u03c3 widths are of \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3 dex, Noeske et al.2007;\nZheng et al. 2007; Damen et al. 2009a,b); and (ii) the\nsample incompleteness, which increases as z is higher (for\nsuch small masses, this may bias the observational average estimates toward larger values for z > 0.3 \u2212 0.5). If\nany, the predicted SSFR(Ms =const)\u2013(1 + z) curves for\nthese low masses decrease slower (are shallower) than\nthe curves inferred from direct observations for z < 1\n(see also Damen et al. 2009a). Better observational estimates for both the low-mass GSM F and SSFRs at high\nredshifts are needed to attain more conclusive results.\nThe dot-dashed line in figure 6 shows the curve\n1/[tH (z) \u2013 1 Gyr](1 \u2212 R) corresponding to a constant\nSFR. Galaxies above (below) this curve are currently\nforming stars at a rate higher (lower) than the past average.\nIn Figure 7, the evolution of SSFR vs. Ms for the\nsame GHETs of previous figures is plotted (red solid\nlines). This plot remarks the fact that small galaxies\nkeep high SSFRs and grow fast at late epochs, while very\nlarge galaxies had high SSFR and rapid growth in the\nremote past, being passive at later epochs. In Figure 7,\n\n9\n\nfrom bottom to top the thick (cyan, blue, green, orange,\nred) lines connect the individual tracks at the redshifts\nz = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (isochrones), respectively. Each one\nof these isochrones corresponds to the average SSFR\u2013Ms\nrelations at a given z and can be compared with direct\nobservational inferences of SSFR vs Ms at different z\nbins. These inferences for samples at different epochs\n(from z \u223c 0 up to z \u223c 2) show that galaxies (mainly\nstar-forming ones) are ordered in the logSSFR\u2013logMs di<\nagram along sequences of intrinsic widths 1\u03c3 \u223c\n0.3 \u2212 0.5\ndex (e.g., Bauer et al. 2005; Salim et al. 2007; Schiminovich et al. 2007; Noeske et al. 2007; Bell et al. 2007;\nDrory & Alvarez 2008; Damen et al. 2009a,b; Santini\net al. 2009; Oliver et al. 2010; Rodighiero et al. 2010).\nThe averages of these sequences are such that the smaller\nis Ms , the higher the SSFR. However, due to the sample incompleteness limit, which increases from a few 109\nM\u2299 to several 1010 M\u2299 from z \u223c 0 to 1, respectively,\nthese averages at low masses might be overestimated.\nThe isochrones showed in Figure 7 are in general within\nthe 1 \u03c3 width of intrinsic spread of the observational\nSSFR-Ms relations. At low masses (where observational\nsamples with measured SFRs are below the completeness\nlimit), the isochrones tend to be below the direct observational estimates of SSFR at the given epoch but at\nintermediate masses the agreement is rather good, i.e.,\nat low masses, the GHET-based SSFR-Ms relations tend\nto be shallower than those constructed from direct observations.\nAt the high mass end, our isochrones fall faster than\nthe averages of the observed SSFR\u2013Ms sequences, which\ntypically are reported for star-forming (blue) galaxies.\nHave in mind that our results refer to average trends\nand in this sense the average high mass galaxies in our\ncase already transited to the passive (red) population. In\nfact, the SSFR\u2013Ms relation at a given z should be constructed separately for active (blue) and passive (red)\ngalaxies. Therefore, in the SSFR\u2013Ms diagram two sequences would appear: at low masses a sequence dominated by blue galaxies and at high masses the sequence\ndominated by red galaxies. From the point of view of the\nGHET analysis, the characteristic mass that divides both\nsequences is related to the transition mass inferred from\nthe GHETs at each z (see \u00a7\u00a73.2 below). As seen in Fig. 7,\nthe average slope of the passive sequence (high-mass side)\nat any z is steeper than that one of the active sequence\n(low-mass end). Interestingly enough, this is the trend\nactually revealed in those observational works where the\nSSFR\u2013Ms relations at different z \u2032 s (out to z \u223c 1.0 \u2212 1.5)\nare plotted separately for red and blue galaxies (Bell et\nal. 2007; Oliver et al. 2010).\nIn general, we conclude that the SSFRs at different\nz's and as a function of Ms predicted on the basis of\nour GHETs are reasonably consistent with recent observational studies based on direct measures of the SSFR\nof galaxies at different z's (especially those that divide\ngalaxies into blue and red ones). This consistency is particularly important because the observational information concerning SFR never enters in our scheme. Therefore, on the one hand, this result is an independent test\nfor the whole approach presented here (it predicts the\nmean SSFRs of galaxies at different epochs consistent\nwith direct observational estimates). On the other hand,\n\n\f10\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\nit supports our hypothesis that the stellar mass buildup\ngiven by the average GHETs is driven by in situ SF. Neither does this mean that the growth of Ms by accretion\nof stellar systems (dry mergers) may not happen, but\nit suggests that it is less dominant than the SF channel\n(our approach and the accuracy of current estimates of\nSSFR at different redshifts do not allow for quantitative\ninferences of the contributions of one or another channel\nof galaxy mass growth).\nA natural question arises about the information the\nGHETs provide on the stellar initial mass function\n(IMF). We have outlined the agreement between our\nSSFR derived from the stellar mass growth and the directly inferred SSFR. The latter inference is highly sensitive to the assumption of a universal IMF. In this sense,\nwe can say that such an agreement is congruent with\na universal IMF. Nevertheless, the uncertainties are yet\nlarge, making it premature to draw such a conclusion as\nsufficiently robust.\nFinally, the results mentioned above confirm and integrate into a unified picture two key facts of galaxy stellar\nmass assembly: (1) the downsizing in SSFR of low\u2013mass\ngalaxies and (2) the population downsizing of massive\ngalaxies. The former will be discussed on the light of\n\u039bCDM-based models in \u00a74. The latter is quantified in\nthe next section.\n3.2. Evolution of the characteristic mass that separates\nactive from passive population\nOur method reveals the existence of a characteristic\nstellar mass at each z, Mtran (z), at which the average\nGHET sharply declines its growth rate. We interpret this\nas a transition from the active to the quiescent regime\nof SFR, the onset of the migration from the star-forming\nblue to the passive red population (population downsizing). We may estimate quantitatively Mtran (z) by identifying the mass at a given z corresponding to the GHET\nthat started to strongly decrease its SSFR, for example,\nwhen the slope of the track in SSFR vs. Ms (see crosses in\nFigure 7) becomes steeper than \u22125 (the measured SSFR\nat this point increases from log(SSFR/Gyr\u22121 )= \u22120.8 at\nz \u223c 0 to \u223c \u22120.5 at z \u223c 3). The stellar Mtran calculated\nthis way is plotted vs z in Figure 8 (diagonal crosses).\nThe function:\nlog(Mtran /M\u2299 ) = 10.30 + 0.55z\n(4)\noffers an approximate description of the results up to\nz \u223c 2 (solid line).\nThe focus now is to compare our result with independent observational pieces of evidence for a transition\nmass from active to quiescent/passive population as a\nfunction of z. Nowadays, as mentioned in the Introduction, it is possible to follow the evolution of the early\u2013\n(red) and late\u2013type (blue) GSM F s separately. In one\nof the most recent and complete works, based on the\nzCOSMOS survey, Pozzetti et al. (2010) determined the\nmass where the early\u2013 and late\u2013type GSM F s cross (different estimators for these two populations are used, see\nthe figure caption) from z \u2248 1 to z \u2248 0.2. Such a crossing\nmass, Mcross , is interpreted namely as the typical mass of\nlate-type galaxies migrating to early-type ones (see also\nBell et al. 2007).\nThe agreement between the Pozzetti et al. (2010) results for Mcross (circles with error bars connected by different dashed lines) with our Mtran (z) is satisfactory as\n\ncan be seen in Figure 8. Local estimates of Mcross by\nBell et al. (2003; filled triangle) and Baldry et al. (2004;\nfilled square) are also plotted, as well as the law inferred\nby Drory & Alvarez (2008) for the mass above which the\nSFR as a function of Ms begins to drop exponentially,\nMtran /M\u2299 = 1010.43 (1+z)2.1 . Our result also agrees qualitatively with other observational studies, with different\ndefinitions of the characteristic mass above which the\npassive (red) population of galaxies dominates in number density (e.g., Bundy et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2007;\nVergani et al. 2008).\nWe may predict also the flow of galaxies transiting from\nactive to passive populations at each z per unit of comoving volume. At each redshift interval z, z + dz (time\ninterval t, t+dt) there are GHETs transiting from the active to the passive regime, whose associated halo masses\nare in the interval Mh , Mh + dMh . The transition rate in\nnumber density is then given by the abundance of halos in\nsuch a mass interval divided by dt, \u03a6(Mh , z)\u00d7dlogMh/dt.\nFor the abundance of halos at each z we use the HM F s\ngiven in Tinker et al. (2008) adapted to our cosmology\nand corrected to include sub-halos according to the functions given in BCW10.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 9. The transition rate in\ncomoving number density of active to passive galaxies up\nto z = 1 scatters around (1.0 \u2212 5.5) \u00d7 10\u22124 gal Gyr\u22121\nMpc\u22123 without any clear trend with z (the scatter is\nmainly due to the discretization of the MAHs in mass and\nz). At z \u2248 0.3, the rate is (3.7 \u00b1 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 gal Gyr\u22121\nMpc\u22123 . The obtained passive population growth rates\ncan be compared with estimates reported in the same\nwork by Pozzetti et al. (2010). They found an average\ngrowth rate in number density of the red population integrated above log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.8 of 6.8(\u00b11.2) \u00d7 10\u22124 gal\nGyr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 for a redshift interval centered in z = 0.34\n(solid triangle with error bar in Fig. 9); this value is\nin reasonable agreement with our results. Note that the\nflow of galaxies in our case is related to a small mass\nrange around the transition mass Mtran given by the average GHETs, while the direct observational determination takes into account a large range of masses. The fact\nthat the latter is only slightly larger than the former implies that indeed most of the galaxies becoming red are\nthose of masses close to the average transition mass.\n3.3. Reliability of the results\nThe results presented above are based mainly on the\nevolution of the Ms \u2013Mh relation. An important question\nis then how general and reliable is the Ms (Mh ,z) relationship used here. A comprehensive analysis of the statistical and systematical uncertainties in Ms (Mh ,z) and how\nthey affect the shape of the Ms -Mh relations at different\nz \u2032 s has been carried out by BCW10. These authors separate the uncertainty sources into three classes: uncertainties (i) in the observational inference of GSM F , (ii)\nin the dark matter HM F , and (iii) in the matching process arising primarily from the intrinsic scatter between\nMs and Mh . They found that by far the largest contributor to the error budget of the local Ms \u2013Mh relation\ncomes from assumptions in converting galaxy luminosity\ninto Ms , which amounts to uncertainties of \u223c 0.25 dex\nin the normalization of the relation (see the error bars\nin Fig.1). The contribution from all other sources of error, including uncertainties in the cosmological model, is\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\n\nFig. 8.- Transition mass as a function of z (diagonal crosses),\ndefined as the mass corresponding to the GHET that at a given\nz started to brake its Ms growth (the slope of the SSFR\u2013Ms relation becomes steeper than \u22125). Masses above Mtran (z) are already\nin the passive phase (red quiescent population). The solid line is\nthe dependence given in eq. (4). The filled circles with error bars\nconnected by lines are the crossing masses, Mcross , at different z's\ndetermined in Pozzetti et al. (2010) as the cross of the GSM F s\nof the early\u2013 and late\u2013type populations. The labels at the end of\neach curve indicate the different schemes adopted by the authors\nfor the classification: MORPH1 and MORPH2 are morphological classifications using their ZH and MRS classification schemes,\nrespectively; PHOT refers to a photometric classification scheme;\nSSFR1 corresponds to a classification into active and quiescent\ngalaxies according to their SSFR. The dotted line is the law given\nin Drory & Alvarez (2008) for the mass above which the SFR as\na function of mass begins to drop exponentially. The filled square\nand triangle are local determinations of the crossing mass of local blue and red GSM F s by Baldry et al. (2004) and Bell et al.\n(2003), respectively.\n\nFig. 9.- Transition rate in number density of active to passive\ngalaxies at each z. The solid triangle with error bar is the estimate of growth rate in number density of red galaxies reported in\nPozzetti et al. (2010) integrated above log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.8.\n\nmuch smaller, ranging from 0.02 to 0.12 dex at z = 0 and\nfrom 0.07 to 0.16 dex at z = 1. At high redshifts (z > 1),\nstatistical uncertainties grow, becoming as significant as\nthe systematic ones. On the other hand, the intrinsic\nscatter in Ms given Mh and the random statistical error\nin Ms inferences have a significant effect on the shape\n\n11\n\nof the Ms \u2013Mh relation at the massive end (taken into\naccount in BCW10).\nAt z \u223c 0, the results from most direct and indirect\nstudies to infer Ms (Mh , z \u223c 0), in spite of the different\nmethods and different local GSM F s used, agree well\namong them, especially if the uncertainties are taken\ninto account (see BCW10 for a comparison). The systematic shift of the (Ms /Mh )\u2013Mh curves to higher Mh\nas z increases (see Figs. 3 and 1) is also a generic result\nobtained by all the authors (CW09; Wang & Jing 2010;\nMoster et al. 2010; BCW10). This implies that the\ntrend reported here of downsizing in SSFR for galaxies\nless massive than Ms \u2248 3 1010 M\u2299 is robust; the downsizing can be respectively stronger or weaker depending\non whether the low-mass end of the curves shifts more or\nless with z. As the completeness of the samples at low\nmasses improves, the estimate of the GSM F s at their\nlow-mass end will be better, and hence more accurately\nthe evolution of the Ms \u2013Mh relation at lower masses will\nbe constrained.\nThe results of different authors may differ regarding\nthe exact location of the Ms \u2013Mh (or Ms /Mh \u2013Mh ) curves\n10.5\nat different z's, especially for Ms >\nM\u2299 . For exam\u223c 10\nple, in Moster et al. (2010), the peaks in (Ms /Mh )\u2013\nMh significantly decrease with z in such a way that the\ncurves intersect only at very high masses. This implies\nthat the GHETs keep growing until z = 0 even for large\ngalaxies, the transition to passive population happening\nonly for the most massive ones. In a similar way, CW09\nconcluded from their analysis that out to z \u223c 1 and for\nMs < 1011 M\u2299 there is not a characteristic mass at which\nthe growth rate of galaxies is truncated. However, this\nis in conflict with independent observations that show\ninstead strong population downsizing (see \u00a7\u00a73.2 and Fig.\n8).\nIn the case of BCW10, the peaks in (Ms /Mh )\u2013Mh\nslightly decrease out to z \u223c 1 and for higher z \u2032 s, increase attaining at z \u2248 4 the same level as at z \u2248 0\n(Figs. 1 and 3). However, the uncertainties in the determination of the (Ms /Mh)\u2013Mh curves are large and other\nbehaviors with z are allowed. The relationship used here\nclosely resembles the BCW10 results as discussed in \u00a72.\nIn order to probe the robustness of the conclusions presented here, we have performed our analysis by using\nMs (Mh ,z) relationships different to the one assumed in\n\u00a72 but yet within the uncertainties of the BCW10 inferences. For example, we explored an Ms (Mh ,z) relationship such that the peaks of the (Ms /Mh)\u2013Mh curves\nremain at the same level for all redshifts (i.e., \u03c7(z)= 0 in\nEq. 2). The obtained GHETs are qualitatively similar\nto the ones presented here and Eq.(4) slightly changes\nto log (Mtran /M\u2299 ) = 10.2 + 0.6z. It is noteworthy that\nthe high mass GHETs in Fig. 4, presenting a stagnation in their Ms growth, show a shape a little sensitive\nto the parameter \u03b4a . By assuming \u03b4a = 0 in Eq. (2), the\nmost massive GHETs, after reaching a maximum stellar\nmass at approximately the same z as presented in Fig.\n4, decline in mass but not by more than 0.1 dex.\nWe conclude that the main results reported here are robust at least for the range of variations in the Ms (Mh ,z)\nrelationship that remains within the current uncertainties in the inference of this relationship.\n\n\f12\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n4. MODEL PREDICTIONS VERSUS HYBRID\n\nEVOLUTIONARY TRACKS\nAny model of galaxy formation and evolution within\nthe hierarchical \u039bCDM scenario should predict how does\nthe Ms -to-Mh ratio (the \"galaxy formation efficiency\") of\nindividual galaxies evolve. Several complex astrophysical\nprocesses intervene in shaping the evolution of this ratio.\nMost of the semi-analytical and semi-numerical models\n\u2013as well as the numerical simulations in that regards\nsubgrid physics\u2013 introduce physical schemes for modeling these processes and for reproducing the present\u2013day\nMs \u2013Mh relation (or the luminosity function) and other\nproperties/correlations of galaxies. The question now is\nwhether such models are able to reproduce the whole\nevolution outlined here. Different approaches to explain\nthe population downsizing have been recently proposed,\nwhile the SSFR downsizing is just starting to be recognized as a problem (e.g., Fontanot et al. 2009; Firmani\net al. 2010; Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 2010).\nIn each one of the figures where the GHETs were presented in this paper, we have plotted the GETs corresponding to two low\u2013mass disk galaxy models that end\ntoday with log(Ms /M\u2299 ) = 9.40 and 10.15 (log(Mh /M\u2299 )\n= 11.25 and 11.73; dotted lines). The models were calculated with a semi-numerical method that self-consistently\nsolves dynamical and hydrodynamical equations of: halo\nmass virialization given the MAH, disk formation in centrifugal equilibrium inside the growing halo, gravitational\ndrag of the disk over the halo inner regions, SF triggered\nby gravitational instability and self-regulated by a vertical energy balance between energy input due to SNe and\nturbulent energy dissipation, and SN\u2013driven mass outflows (Firmani & Avila-Reese 2000; Firmani et al. 2010).\nThe main assumptions implicit in the models are those\nof: spherical and cylindrical symmetries for the halo and\ndisk, respectively, gas infalling on dynamical time scales\n('cold mode'), adiabatic invariance during halo contraction, and detailed angular momentum conservation for\nthe infalling gas.\nThe baryon fraction is assumed initially as the universal one, but the feedback\u2013driven outflow reduces significantly this fraction. The parameters of the outflow model\nare fixed in such a way that namely the (low-mass) Ms \u2013\nMh relation at z \u223c 0 is reproduced. In Firmani et al.\n(2010) we have shown that this happens only in the case\nof the so\u2013called energy\u2013driven outflow and for a high SN\nenergy\u2013transfer efficiency3 . Because the exploration in\nthis paper is only at the level of average trends, the halo\nMAHs used in the models are the averages among 20000\nrealizations for each given mass, and the used halo spin\nparameter \u03bb was fixed to 0.03 at all z's, a value slightly\nsmaller than the mean of z = 0 relaxed halos in N-body\ncosmological simulations (e.g., Bett et al. 2007). On\nthe one hand, the N-body simulations show that \u03bb does\nnot significantly changes with time for halos growing in\nthe accretion mode (e.g., Peirani, Mohayaee & de Freitas\nPacheco 2004; D'Onghia & Navarro 2007). On the other\nhand, our models show that the radius evolution of disk\ngalaxies agrees with observational inferences when the\n3 If the possibility of late re\u2013accretion of the lost gas is taken\ninto account, then in Firmani et al. (2010) it was found that the\nmomentum\u2013driven outflow is the one that best can help to reproduce the z = 0 Ms \u2013Mh relation.\n\ngas \u03bb parameter is roughly constant in time (Firmani &\nAvila-Reese 2009).\nThe GETs in Figure 4 show that the stellar mass\ngrowth is roughly proportional to the halo MAH as z\ndecreases. The model GETs and the GHETs in the\nMs \u2013Mh diagram (Fig. 2) are very different; the average\nslopes of the GETs are dlogMs /dlogMh\u22481.4, much less\nthan the slopes of the corresponding GHETs. The model\nMs -to-Mh ratio in Figure 3 decreases toward the past\ndue mainly to the feedback\u2013driven outflow effect, but\nslightly, while the GHETs of the same masses evidence\na very fast decreasing. The Ms \u2013Mh and (Ms /Mh )\u2013Mh\nrelations (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively) predicted by the\nmodel GETs at low masses change with z (Ms slightly\nincreases with z for a fixed Mh ) in an opposite direction with respect to the empirically inferred observations.\nThis discrepancy represents a serious problem for all the\ntheory behind the models.\nThe dramatic differences between the GETs and\nGHETs are also seen in the SSFR evolution plots (Figs.\n5 and 7). We remark here the downsizing aspect. The\nGET-based SSFRs of the two galaxies evolve almost parallel (with a law SSFR\u221d (1+z)2.2\u22122.3 ), being the SSFR\nof the larger galaxy slightly higher since high z \u2032 s (weak\nupsizing). Instead, the GHET-based SSFRs cross each\nother at high z (see the upper side of Figure 5), in such a\nway that larger galaxies have higher SSFR at very high\nz \u2032 s, but at lower z \u2032 s, the situation is inverted in such\na way that as z \u2192 0, the smaller is the galaxy, the\nhigher the SSFR (downsizing). The comparison of theoretical models with the GHET-based SSFRs suggests\nthat some astrophysical mechanism not considered up to\nnow should systematically delay the onset of SF activity\nthe smaller the halo is.\nThe low SSFRs (early stellar mass assembly) of small\ngalaxies predicted by the models, which include energydriven outflows, are actually generic to all \u039bCDM-based\nmodels. This issue has been reported in different ways\nby the semi-analytic models. Most of these models\nshow that the stellar population of small galaxies (Ms \u2248\n109 \u2212 1010.5 M\u2299 ) is assembled too early, becoming these\ngalaxies older, redder, and with lower SSFRs at later\nepochs than the observed galaxies in the same mass range\n(e.g., Somerville et al. 2008; Fontanot et al. 2009; Santini\net al. 2009). The problem is both at the level of satellite and central galaxies. For example, it was shown that\nmodels typically overpredict the observed stellar population ages (Pasquali et al. 2009) and stellar masses (Liu et\nal. 2010) of central galaxies in low mass halos. By means\nof a galaxy evolutionary model similar to ours, Dutton,\nvan den Bosch & Dekel (2010b) also find that the SSFR\nof model low-mass galaxies is below the average of observations, specially at redshifts z \u223c 1 \u2212 2, though these\nauthors conclude that their models are able to reproduce\nroughly the main features of the observed SFR sequence.\nFinally, it should be said that N\u2013body + hydrodynamics simulations of individual low mass galaxies in a cosmological context also face the issue of too low SSFRs (as\nwell as too high stellar and baryonic mass fractions; e.g.,\nCol\u0131\u0301n et al. 2010). In Firmani et al. (2010) we explored\nthe inclusion in our semi-numeric models of re-accretion\nof the ejected gas for a broad range of possibilities. As\nexpected, the SSFR of galaxies increases in general due\nto re-accretion but this increasing goes in the opposite\n\n\fGalaxy downsizing\ndirection of downsizing: only moderately for low-mass\ngalaxies and too much for the larger galaxies.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nEmpirically inferred Ms \u2013Mh relations from z \u223c 0 to\nz \u223c 4 were connected with average \u039bCDM\u2013halo MAHs\nin order to infer the corresponding individual average\nstellar mass growth histories, called here GHETs. We\nhave adopted an Ms (Mh ,z) relationship continuous in the\n0 \u2212 4 redshift range and in agreement with the inferences\nby BCW10, who used the technique of jointly matching\nthe abundances of observed GSM F s to the theoretical\nHM F s at different z \u2032 s. The main results obtained here,\nwhich allow to establish a unified description of average\ngalaxy evolutionary tracks for a large range of masses,\nare as follows.\n\u2022 The folding in the Ms \u2013Mh \u2013z surface, reflected mainly\nas peaks in the (Ms /Mh )\u2013Mh diagram that shift to\nhigher masses as z increases, introduces an important\nfeature in the behavior of the GHETs. For masses much\nsmaller than the peak mass at a given z, Mhp (z), the\nGHETs are in an active growth phase, whereas masses\nclose to or greater than Mhp (z) are in a quiescent or\ncompletely passive (stagnated) phase (Figs. 2 and 3).\nTherefore, at each z there is a characteristic stellar mass\nat which on average galaxies slow down their growth\nand transit from an active (star\u2013forming blue) population to a passive (red) population. This transition mass\ndecreases with time, giving rise to a phenomenon called\nhere 'population downsizing'.\n10.5\n\u2022 Galaxies less massive than Mhp at z = 0 (Ms <\n\u223c 10\n12.0\n<\nM\u2299 , Mh \u223c 10\nM\u2299 ) have still growing GHETs. Besides, the lower the mass, the faster the later Ms growth,\ndue likely to a delayed and lately active SF phase, a phenomenon called 'downsizing in SSFR'.\n\u2022 The shapes of the average stellar and halo mass assembling histories are quite different (Figure 4). For\ngalaxies that at z = 0 have Ms < 1010.5 M\u2299 , their dark\nMAHs at later epochs grow slightly slower as smaller is\nthe mass, while their stellar GHETs grow much faster.\nFor Ms (z = 0) > 1010.5 M\u2299 , the larger the galaxy, the\nearlier its GHETs attain a stellar mass stagnation; until\nthis epoch, the more massive the galaxy, the faster the\nMs growth with respect to the corresponding Mh growth.\n\u2022 By neglecting any stellar mass growth by accretion\n(dry mergers), a GHET allows to find the corresponding\nSSFR history, SSFR(z), by calculating \u1e40s /Ms and correcting by the stellar mas-loss recycling factor R. The\ninferred SSFRs at different z's and as a function of Ms\n(Figs. 5, 6, and 7) are reasonably consistent with recent observational studies based on direct measures of\nthe SSFR of star-forming galaxies at different z's. The\nGHET-based SSFRs corresponding to masses that at a\ngiven z are larger than the transition mass Mtran (z), are\nmuch lower than the measured SSFRs of (rare) luminous\nblue galaxies, but agree or are even slightly larger than\nthe measured SSFRs of red galaxies. The overall consistency between the GHET-based SSFR-Ms relations at\ndifferent z \u2032 s with direct inferences of these relations suggests that the accretion of stellar systems (mergers) plays\na minor role in the Ms assembling of galaxies, excepting\nperhaps those that transited to the passive sequence (the\nmost massive ones).\n\n13\n\n\u2022 By using the SSFR vs. Ms evolutionary tracks, we\ncalculated the characteristic transition mass at each z,\nMtran (z), above which the average GHET starts to significantly decrease its growth rate, transiting from the\nactive to the passive galaxy population. The result\nis roughly described by the relation log(Mtran /M\u2299 ) =\n10.30 + 0.55z (at least up to z \u223c 2). This result agrees\nwith recent observational determinations of the evolution\nof the mass, at which the early- and late-type GSM F\ncomponents cross each other, from z \u2248 1 to the present\n(Fig. 8).\n\u2022 We determined also the transition rate in number\ndensity of active (blue) to quiescent (red) galaxy population. At z \u2248 0 such a rate is 10\u22123.4\u00b10.2 gal Gyr\u22121 Mpc\u22123\nand up to z = 1 the rates are within (1.0 \u2212 5.5) 10\u22124 gal\nGyr\u22121 Mpc\u22123 , in good agreement with direct observational inferences of growth rate in number density of red\ngalaxies.\n\u2022 We further explored whether \u039bCDM-based models\nof galaxy evolution are able to predict galaxy evolutionary tracks (called here 'GETs') in agreement with the\nGHETs, in particular at low masses where the downsizing in SSFR is evidenced by the GHETs. We have shown\nthat while the models with SN energy\u2013driven outflows\nare able to reproduce the local Ms \u2013Mh relation (see also\nFirmani et al. 2010), they fail in reproducing this relation\nat higher z's. The difference between GETs and GHETs\nat low masses is rather large: the former ones show a fast\ndecrease in SSFR with time almost independent of mass,\nwhile for the latter ones, the lower the mass, the slower\nthe late decrease of SSFR (downsizing in SSFR).\nFrom these results, we conclude that the general description of stellar mass buildup of galaxies provided by\nour average GHETs appears rather successful: the predicted SSFR histories as a function of Ms and the predicted transition mass Mtran as a function of z, as well\nas the transition flux at different z \u2032 s, are roughly consistent with direct (but yet limited) observational estimates of all these quantities. Furthermore, our analysis\nreveals nicely the existence of a galaxy bi-modality related to the Ms growth activity: as z decreases, smaller\nand smaller masses transit on average from the active\n(blue star-forming) to the passive (red) population.\nAn important ingredient of our approach is the connection of \u039bCDM halos to the observed galaxies. Therefore,\nthe underlying hierarchical \u039bCDM scenario is successful\nin the sense that the predictions of the model are in agreement with independent observations. The average stellar\nand dark mass buildup of galaxies were found to be significantly different, specially for low and high masses. This\nresult is in qualitative agreement with CW09 in spite of\nthe differences in the data, method, and redshift range\nbetween their and our work. However, the results from\nboth works are different at a quantitative level, which is\nseen, for example, in the different conclusions regarding\nthe existence of a characteristic mass at each epoch at\nwhich the SSFR of galaxies is truncated. Note that the\nSSFR and the determination of this characteristic mass\n(Mtran ) are related to the first and second derivatives of\nthe Ms growth, respectively.\nOur results put in a unified picture both the popula10\ntion downsizing (related to galaxies with Ms >\nM\u2299\n\u223c 3 10\nat z = 0) and the downsizing in SSFR (related to smaller\n\n\f14\n\nFirmani & Avila-Reese\n\ngalaxies). The challenges are now to explain the processes that produce: (1) the transition from active to\npassive regimes in Ms growth associated with a sharp cessation of the SFR in massive galaxies, (2) the fact that\nthe typical mass of SSFR truncation, Mtran , decreases\nwith cosmic time (population downsizing), and (3) the\nfact that the smaller is the halo, the more is delayed the\ngalaxy's Ms growth (downsizing in SSFR).\nItems (1) and (2) seem to find partial explanations in\naspects related to the same dark halo clustering (environment) evolution (e.g., Neistein et al. 2006) as well\nas to the introduction of feedback processes due to the\nAGNs of massive galaxies (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998; Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Granato et al. 2004; Cattaneo\net al. 2005; de Lucia et al. 2005; Bower et al. 2006;\n\nCroton et al. 2006). Item (3), as shown here, is a sharp\nand less understood problem. Later re-accretion of the\ngas ejected by galaxies due to SN-driven outflows does\nnot account for a solution to this issue (Firmani et al.\n2010). A better understanding of the astrophysical processes intervening in galaxy formation and evolution as\nwell as the role of environmental processes is necessary.\nWe are grateful to Dr. L.
