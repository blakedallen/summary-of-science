All computations rely on density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation (PBE) and\naccount for on\u2013site Coulomb interactions via inclusion of a Hubbard correction, PBE+U, where U\nis computed from linear response theory. This approach is validated by investigating the interaction between TiO2 (110) surfaces and typical probe species (H, H2 O, CO). Relaxed structures and\nbinding energies are compared to both data from the literature and plain PBE results, thus allowing\nthe performance of the PBE+U approach for the specific purpose to be verified. The main focus\nof the study is on the properties of gold-promoted titania surfaces and their interactions with CO.\nBoth PBE+U and PBE optimized structures of Au adatoms adsorbed on stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 surfaces are computed, along with their electronic structure. The charge rearrangement\ninduced by the adsorbates at the metal/oxide contact are also analyzed in detail and discussed. By\nperforming PBE+U ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the diffusion\nof Au adatoms on the stoichiometric surface is highly anisotropic. The metal atoms migrate either\nalong the top of the bridging oxygen rows, or around the area between these rows, from one bridging\nposition to the next along the [001] direction. No translational motion perpendicular to this direction is observed. Approximate ab initio thermodynamics predicts that under O\u2013rich conditions,\nstructures obtained by substituting a Ti5c atom with an Au atom are thermodynamically stable\nover a wide range of temperatures and pressures that are relevant to applications in the realm of\ncatalysis. Finally, it is shown that TiO2 (110) surfaces containing positively charged Au ions activate\nmolecular CO, whereas a single negatively charged Au\u2212\u03b4 species bound to an O vacancy only weakly\ninteracts with CO. Despite this, the calculations predict that the reactivity of gold nanoparticles\nnucleated at O vacancies can be recovered for cluster sizes as small as Au2 .\nPACS numbers: 68.43.Fg, 73.20.Hb, 68.47.Gh, 82.65.+r\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTitania, TiO2 , is a metal oxide of both fundamental interest and technological importance1\u20135 . It is used in several key technologies including pigments, coatings, electronic devices, implants, gas sensors, photochemical reactions, and catalysis 6\u20138 . One of the most important properties of titania is that it can be easily reduced (see e.g.\nRef. 9 for a concise presentation), strongly affecting its\nchemical properties in general and its reactivity in particular10 . One way to reduce the TiO2 surface is to remove\nsurface oxygen atoms, thereby creating O vacancies. The\nremoval of an O atom gives rise to two excess electrons\nand the appearance of new electronic states within the\nband gap at about 0.7 to 0.9 eV below the conduction\nband edge, thus creating an F \u2013center2,3,11,12 . By this\nprocess, two substrate Ti4+ ions change formally to a\nTi3+ oxidation state; see Ref. 13 for recent literature and\na detailed picture of the (de\u2013)localization dynamics of\nthe excess electrons. Alternatively, the TiO2 surface can\nbe reduced by hydroxylation of surface O atoms via adsorption of hydrogen14\u201318 . The interaction of TiO2 with\nwater is an important process which has to be taken into\naccount, since it occurs easily, even in well\u2013controlled\nUHV experiments. The adsorption of water on TiO2 has\nbeen investigated extensively, both experimentally and\n\ntheoretically9,10,19\u201336 ; in particular see Refs. 10,19 for\nthe most recent reviews of this literature.\nMost relevant to catalysis is the interaction of Au and\nCO with stoichiometric or reduced TiO2 surfaces and,\nin particular, the interaction of titania\u2013supported gold\nparticles with CO molecules. A detailed understanding\nof the process of CO adsorption is required to best comprehend its wide variety of applications2,3 , such as CO\noxidation at low temperature12 , the water gas shift reaction, and CO hydrogenation37,38 . In a recent paper39 ,\nwe investigated the interaction of CO with the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface using a combination of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and post Hartree-Fock methods. For a single CO molecule in the (4 \u00d7 2) surface\nunit cell of our slab, we found that the upright position\nabove the fivefold coordinated Ti sites, Ti5c , remains the\npreferential adsorption geometry, even without enforcing symmetry. On the reduced titania surface, results\nfrom temperature\u2013programmed desorption (TPD) experiments40,41 suggested that, at low coverages, CO adsorption occurs at non-adjacent Ti5c sites. These findings\nwere supported by various calculations42\u201344 . However,\nearlier studies implicated bridge\u2013bonded oxygen vacancies as adsorption sites for CO45,46 , a conclusion corroborated by some theoretical investigations47,48 as well.\nThe seminal work of Haruta and coworkers49 has\n\n\f2\nshown that the low\u2013temperature oxidation of molecular\nCO can be efficiently catalyzed by highly dispersed Au\nnanoparticles supported on TiO2 surfaces50\u201353 . It is now\nrecognized that gold nanoclusters, prepared in different\nways and supported on various metal oxides, are able to\ncatalyze a number of reactions54,55 , and that the size of\nthe gold particles substantially affects the catalytic activity. The gold clusters should be smaller than about 5 nm\nfor high catalytic activity to occur, suggesting the key\nimportance of metal/support interfacial interactions on\na nanometer scale. Extensive studies of the Au/TiO2 system link the peculiar catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles on titania to several factors: high concentration of\nlow\u2013coordination sites56,57 , quantum size effects of two\u2013\nlayer Au islands58 , active perimeter sites of the nanoparticles59 , and charge transfer between the gold particles\nand the supporting oxide52,60 .\nOver the past decade, DFT\u2013based calculations have\nbeen extensively employed to study the interaction between gold and the TiO2 (110) surface7,61\u201371 . Most of the\nexisting theoretical studies provide information on stable\nadsorption sites of Au on the stoichiometric and reduced\ntitania studies, while less effort has been devoted to the\nstudy of the O\u2013rich Au/TiO2 (110) system70,71 and the\ndiffusion of Au adatoms on the stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 (110) surface7,67,68 . A wide variation in the\nlowest\u2013energy positions of Au on titania are reported in\nthe literature63 , which can be explained in part by considering that Au can diffuse rather easily on the stoichiometric surface67 . The potential energy surface (PES)\nof a single Au adatom deposited on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface or adsorbed into a surface O vacancy\nhas been explored using static calculations67 . It has been\nshown that Au migration on the stoichiometric surface is\ntwo\u2013dimensional, with a relatively flat profile. In the\nscenario where an Au atom is substituted for a surface\nTi5c site, it has been demonstrated that the Au atom is\ncapable of weakening bonds of surface oxygens with the\noxide71 .\nMost of the density functional theory studies available\nin the literature dealing with defects and/or molecules\nadsorbed on titania substrates using reasonably sized supercells make use of local (LDA) or semilocal (GGA)\nfunctionals. Despite widespread use, such functionals are\nknown to often (but not always9) fail to predict qualitatively correct electronic structures for reduced transition metal oxides, due to the self\u2013interaction error inherent in the functionals. To partially correct for the\nself\u2013interaction error, different computational methods\ncan be used: perturbative many\u2013body theories such\nas \"GW\"72\u201374 , LDA plus dynamical mean field theory\n(DMFT)75 , pseudo self\u2013interaction\u2013correction schemes\n(pSIC)76 , LDA plus U77 , and other methods that rely\non hybrid functionals78 . Recently, GGA+U approaches\nhave been applied with promising results in studies of\nintrinsic electron transport in TiO2 bulk79,80 and in the\ninvestigation of the charge (de\u2013)localization dynamics induced by surface oxygen vacancies on the (110) surface\n\nof TiO2 in the rutile structure13 . Within the GGA+U\napproach, the electronic structure is partially corrected\nfor the self\u2013interaction error by adding a Hubbard term\nacting on the Ti\u20133d orbitals. This approach has the advantage of not adding much computational overhead to a\nstandard GGA calculation in the plane wave / pseudopotential framework, thus enabling one to use fairly large\nsupercells in order to allow structural relaxation to occur\nor to carry out ab initio dynamics.\nIn this article, the PBE+U formalism is employed to\ninvestigate the structural and electronic properties of\ngold-supported TiO2 (110) surface catalysts and their reactivity towards CO. As a first step, the PBE+U approach is applied to study the interaction between the\nstoichiometric or reduced TiO2 (110) surface and small\nprobe species: H, H2 O, and CO. The PBE+U structures\nand binding energies are compared to both the corresponding plain PBE results and reference data in the literature in order to assess the applicability of the PBE+U\napproach for the present purpose. When it comes to gold\non titania, our PBE+U ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend existing static relaxations and nudged\nelastic band mappings of the PES and demonstrate that\nAu adatoms diffuse in a highly directional manner on\nthe stoichiometric surface. The metal atoms migrate\neasily, either along on top of the bridging oxygen rows\nor around the area between these rows, from one bridging position to the next, along the [001] direction. The\nrelative thermodynamic stability of different TiO2 (110)\nstructures is furthermore studied by employing the formalism of approximate ab initio thermodynamics. Our\ncalculations greatly extend existing studies and show that\nunder O\u2013rich conditions, the thermodynamically most\nstable structure is the defective Au@VTi5c surface structure (obtained by substituting a surface Ti5c atom with\nan Au adatom), while under Ti\u2013rich conditions, the Au\nadatoms are preferentially adsorbed at O vacancies.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In\nSection II the model system, the methods and the computational details are summarized. The PBE+U formalism is validated in Section III by studying the interaction\nof the TiO2 (110) surfaces with a set of well-studied adsorbates such as H, H2 O and CO. The main part of\nthe paper is Section IV which presents novel insights\ninto the structures, electronic properties, thermodynamics and dynamics of gold-promoted rutile TiO2 (110) surfaces and their interaction with CO. The concluding Section VI summarizes the main results and puts them in a\nbroader perspective.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODS AND COMPUTATIONAL\nDETAILS\n\nThe TiO2 (110) surfaces were modeled by four\nO \u2212 Ti2 O2 \u2212 O trilayer (4x2) supercell slabs separated\nby more than 10 \u00c5 of vacuous space normal to the surface. The bottom of the slab was passivated with pseu-\n\n\f3\ndohydrogen atoms of nuclear charge +4/3 and +2/3 in\norder to achieve well\u2013converged results. This is our so\u2013\ncalled \"standard setup\" which has been previously carefully constructed9 by performing extensive tests on the\nconvergence of surface energies as well as hydrogen and\nwater adsorption energies, with respect to both the number of relaxed outermost trilayers and the thickness of the\nslab itself (see tables and graphs in9 for detailed comparisons). The system size employed in our calculations,\ncorresponding to 208 atoms for the stoichiometric slab,\nbelongs to the largest systems used so far in order to\nmodel the surface, in particular when it comes to performing ab initio molecular dynamics. In order to further check the convergence we optimized two five trilayer\nslabs (one with an empty surface O vacancy and one with\nan Au adatom at this vacancy) and confirmed that the\nresulting spin density and excess charge localization is\nthe same as reported herein for our \"standard setup\".\nThe gradient\u2013corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE)81 was employed to describe semilocally the\nexchange\u2013correlation effects. The spin\u2013polarized KohnSham equations were solved in the plane wave / pseudopotential framework using Vanderbilt's ultrasoft pseudopotentials82 with a cutoff of 25 Ry using the \u0393\u2013point.\nThe Ti pseudopotential was constructed from an ionic\n3d1 4s2 configuration and the 3s and 3p semicore electrons were treated as full valence states. It is well established that adding a Hubbard U term acting on the\nTi\u20133d orbitals greatly improves the quality of LDA or\nGGAs in describing the electronic structure of both oxidized and reduced titania surfaces13,79,80,83\u201388 . Following our previous work13 , we used a self\u2013consistent linear\nresponse formalism89,90 to compute the Hubbard term,\nwhich turns out to be U = 4.2 eV for this particular\nsetup; the occupations of the d orbitals were calculated\nusing atomic\u2013like wave function projectors. It will not\nhave escaped attention that our value of the U parameter is larger than that recently derived by Mattioli et\nal.91 (i.e. U = 3.25 eV). This can be attributed to the\ndifferent d-orbitals used as projectors for the integration\nof the d-orbital occupation numbers. The U value of\n3.25 eV obtained in91 was derived using the d-orbital of\nthe neutral Ti atom as a projector, whereas our value,\nU = 4.20 eV, is computed by using Ti+1 as a reference,\nwhich in our opinion more closely resembles the charge\nstate of Ti in the TiO2 (110) surface. At this point it\nshould be noted that we also obtained U = 3.20 eV when\nusing the d-orbital of the neutral Ti atom as the projector\ninstead, which is in agreement with the U value reported\nin91 . Similarly, performing the calculations of FeO Pickett et al.92 showed that the calculated Hubbard energy\nstrongly depends on the choice of d-orbital. Using the dorbital of the neutral Fe atom they obtained U = 4.6 eV\nwhereas using the Fe+2 dication yields a substantially\nlarger value of U = 7.8 eV. This is a well-known and\nstill poorly understood shortcoming of the U parameter\nderivation procedures that use atomic-like d-orbitals as\nprojectors for the integration of the occupations of the\n\nd-orbitals in solids, which, in turn, is an input for the\ncomputation of the Hubbard correction to LDA/GGA\ndensity functionals89 . The static optimizations for the\ndifferent TiO2 (110) surface structures were carried out\nusing the Quantum Espresso93 code. All structures were\nrelaxed by minimizing the atomic forces, where convergence was assumed to have been achieved when the maximum component of the residual forces on the ions was\nless than 0.02 eV/\u00c5. Here, only the lowest trilayer atoms\nwere constrained to their equilibrium positions while all\nother atoms were free to move during optimization. All\nab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations94 were\ncarried out using the same spin\u2013polarized PBE+U approach, together with the Car\u2013Parrinello propagation\nscheme,95 using a fictitious electron mass of 700 a.u. and\na time step of 0.145 fs. Our in-house modified version of\nthe CPMD96 code was used for this purpose.\nH\nThe adsorption energy Eads\nper H atom on the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface is computed from\n\u0010\n1 h H\u2212ads\nNH H2 \u0011i\nslab\u2212TiO2\nE\n,\nEtot (NH ) \u2212 Etot\n+\nNH\n2 tot\n(1)\nH\u2212ads\nwhere Etot\n(NH ) is the total energy of the slab satuslab\u2212TiO2\nrated with NH H adatoms; here Etot\nis the energy\nof the stoichiometric slab, which we take as a reference,\nH2\nand Etot\nis the energy of a H2 molecule.

Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, the most stable surface composition at a given temperature T and pressure p is given\nby the minimum of the surface Gibbs free energy. Since\n\n\f4\nwe are only interested in the relative stabilities of surface structures, we directly compute the differences in\nthe surface Gibbs free energies \u2206Gads (T, p) between the\ndefective and the ideal surface according to\n\"\n1\n\u2206Gads (T, p) =\nE H\u2212ads (NH )\u2212\nA tot\n#\n(4)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nslab\u2212TiO2\nEtot\n+ \u2206NH \u03bcH (T, p)\n,\nwhere A is the surface area, \u2206NH is the difference in\nthe number of H atoms between the two surfaces, and\n\u03bcH (T, p) is the chemical potential representing the Gibbs\nfree energy of the gas phase with which the H atoms are\nexchanged. Assuming that all differences in entropy and\nvolume contributions in \u2206Gads (T, p) are negligible, the\nGibbs free energies are approximated by their respective\ntotal energies of our DFT slab calculations as usual99\u2013101 .\nThe upper bound for the chemical potential \u03bcH (T, p) is\ngiven by the total energy of its most stable elemental\nH2\nphase98 , that is, molecular hydrogen ( 21 Etot\n).

The free\nenergy of formation of the Au/TiO2 (110) surface structures \u2206ads G(T, p) is assumed to depend on the temperature and pressure only via the oxygen chemical potential\n\u03bcO (T, p) given by\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\np\n0\n\u03bcO (T, p) = \u03bcO (T, p ) + kT ln\n.\n(5)\n2\np0\n\nbulk\nwhere ETiO\nis the energy of a formula unit of the TiO2\n2\nv\nv\nrepresent the\nand NTi\nbulk phase.

In\u2013depth ab initio thermodynamics considerations reveal a maximum saturation\nlevel of hydrogen on this oxide surface of about 60\u201370%,\nin excellent agreement with the above\u2013mentioned experimental observations. Adsorption of hydrogen on the stoichiometric surface results in its reduction by introducing\none electron per adsorbed H atom into the substrate.\nWe first consider the interaction of H with the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface. The hydroxylated surface has\nbeen investigated for a wide range of H coverages using\nboth PBE+U and PBE. In agreement with both plain\nPBE calculations and experimental results, we find that\nH atoms preferentially adsorb on top of surface Ob atoms\nof the stoichiometric titania surface, leading to the formation of OH groups with O\u2013H bond lengths of \u223c 1 \u00c5. In\naddition, our PBE+U calculations predict that one electron per H atom adsorbed on the surface is transferred\nto the substrate, leading to the formation of Ti3+ ions\n(see Table I). The newly-formed OH groups are found\nto be tilted by about 20\u201350\u25e6 in opposite [11\u03040] directions,\nas previously reported. The PBE and PBE+U values\nH\nof the adsorption energies Eads\nper H atom at different\ncoverages are reported in Table I. The ground state configuration of the fully hydroxylated titania surface yields\n(2\u00d71) symmetry, but at room temperature OH groups\nwill be fully disordered with respect to their axes because of the tiny barrier that must be overcome in order\nto flip their orientation.\nAt all coverages, the PBE+U adsorption energies are\nfound to be significantly lower, by about \u22120.3 to \u22120.6 eV,\ncompared to the PBE data in Table I. However, the same\nstability trend obtained by employing the PBE+U functional is obtained using the standard PBE functional,\ni.e. a decrease of the adsorption energy with increasing\ncoverage. Nevertheless, even at full monolayer coverage,\nthe adsorption energy per atom is still significant and\nnegative when using PBE+U, whereas it is close to zero\naccording to PBE. Clearly, such total energy considerations need to be supplemented with ab initio thermodynamics in order to check the thermodynamic stability of\nthe surface at different saturation levels. The results are\nsummarized in terms of the surface free energy diagram\nin Fig. 1. Both PBE+U and PBE predict that the fully\nhydrogenated surface will be thermodynamically unstable at all accessible hydrogen partial pressures. PBE+U\nand PBE also agree in that saturation of this surface\nby hydrogen is reached at a coverage on the order of\n70%. Thus, the previous PBE predictions9 and agreement with experimental observations18 upon hydroxylating TiO2 (110) are qualitatively confirmed. (for reasoning, see the detailed conceptual discussion in Ref. 9).\nHowever, significant strengthening of the adsorption and\nshifts in the surface phase diagram are observed when\nusing PBE+U, thus localizing the excess charges upon\n\n20\n10\n0\n\n3/4 ML\n\n5/8 ML\n\n5/8 ML\n\n1/2 ML\n\n1/2 ML\n1/4 ML\n1/4 ML\n1/8 ML\n\n1/8 ML\n\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n\u2206\u03bc H (eV)\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nFIG. 1: Free energy \u2206Gads (T, p) for H adsorption on\nTiO2 (110) stoichiometric surfaces with different hydrogen\ncoverages as a function of the hydrogen chemical potential\n\u2206\u03bcH . Conversion to hydrogen partial pressures pH2 (upper\naxis) has been carried out at T = 400 K (see text). The\nred and blue lines represent the PBE+U and PBE results,\nrespectively.\n\nIt is well-known that the investigated surface contains\na significant number of oxygen vacancies (\u223c 5 %), not\njust in ill-defined industrial situations, but even under\nwell-controlled experimental conditions.2 Therefore, the\ninvestigation of the adsorption of water molecules on the\nreduced TiO2 (110) surface is of great importance in the\nframe of addressing the fundamental issue of dissociative versus molecular adsorption modes9,10,19,33 . We thus\nconsider the interaction between H2 O and the TiO2 surface. We have performed systematic PBE+U and PBE\ncalculations of H2 O adsorbed on the reduced TiO2 surface, considering a titania surface containing a single VO\nvacancy; this greatly extends our recent comprehensive\nwork9 concerning water on the stoichiometric surface using plain PBE.\nThe specific adsorption configurations for a water\nmolecule on the reduced surface, which we consider in\n\n\f6\nthis investigation, are compiled in Fig. 2, and the corresponding adsorption energies are collected in Table II.\nThe Ti5c surface sites are labeled in relation to the\nVO vacancy, where site Ti0 denotes a nearest\u2013neighbor\nTi5c atom and sites Ti1 and Ti2 are the second and third\nnearest-neighbour Ti5c sites parallel to the Ob row containing the VO site; see panel (a) of Fig. 2. In agreement\nwith experimental data, we find that on the reduced surface, H2 O molecules prefer to dissociatively adsorb at VO\nvacancy sites, leading to a configuration with two surface\nOH groups as shown in panel (b) of Fig. 2. We therefore\nend up with a stoichiometric titania surface with two H\natoms adsorbed on two surface Ob atoms. Once the water\nmolecule dissociates at the oxygen defect through proton\ntransfer to an adjacent Ob atom, the PBE+U (PBE)\nadsorption energy is \u22121.61 eV (\u22121.18 eV). A projected\nPDOS analysis reveals that upon dissociation of water at\nthe VO site, two second\u2013layer Ti3+ ions are present in the\nsubstrate. This value of Eads is \u223c 0.4 eV lower than the\ncorresponding plain PBE value and previously reported\nvalues,35,36,103 which are between \u22120.94 and \u22121.1 eV.\nThe energy value deduced from a water desorption peak\nat 520 K in TDS experiments104 using the simple Redhead formula105 is about \u22121.4 eV, which is between the\nPBE+U and PBE values. However, the estimation of\ndesorption energies using the Redhead formula can be\nbiased by as much as 25%, which implies that both values must be considered to be consistent with experiment.\nWe now turn our attention to the adsorption and dissociation of water at Ti5c sites next to VO . We anticipate\nthat, as observed in the case of H2 O dissociatively adsorbed at the VO site, the interaction between water and\nthe Ti5c sites does not further reduce the metal oxide\nsupport. All PBE+U calculations predict the presence\nof two reduced Ti3+ ions before and after the adsorption\nof H2 O at Ti5c sites. Water molecules can be adsorbed either dissociatively (labeled as \"D\") or molecularly (\"M\")\nat the various Ti5c sites (i.e. Ti0, Ti1, and Ti2) next to\nVO (see Fig. 2). When H2 O dissociates at a Ti5c site, the\nresulting configuration contains an OH group bonded to\na Ti5c atom and an H atom bonded to a nearest\u2013neighbor\nO atom of the Ti5c in the [11\u03040] direction. We have considered two different topologies: first, where the H atom\ncoming from the dissociated water molecule binds to an\nO atom belonging to the Ob row in which the VO vacancy\nsite is present (labeled configuration \"A\"); and second,\nwith the H atom bonded to O atoms belonging to an\nadjacent Ob row parallel to the Ob row that hosts VO\n(configuration \"B\"). See Table II for the corresponding\nadsorption energies.\nOur PBE+U and PBE calculations suggest that, in the\npresence of an oxygen vacancy, water molecules adsorb\ndissociatively or molecularly at Ti5c sites with Eads in\nthe range of \u22120.45 to \u22120.92 eV. Once the water molecule\ndissociates at a Ti5c site, it forms a pair of terminal hydroxyls. Therefore, in the dissociative case, we always\nend up with an OH group bonded to a Ti5c site and a\nprotonic H atom transferred to an adjacent Ob atom,\n\nTABLE II: Adsorption energies Eads (in eV) in the case of\nadsorption of water on the reduced surface for PBE+U and\nplain PBE reported in parentheses; see Fig. 2 for labeling.\nconfiguration\nDA\nMA\nDB\nMB\nH2 O@VO\n\nsite Ti0\n2.27 ( 1.58)\n\u22120.77 ( \u22120.79)\n\u22120.87 ( \u22120.89)\n\u22120.77 ( \u22120.80)\n\u22121.61 ( \u22121.18)\n\nsite Ti1\n\u22120.71 ( \u22120.81)\n\u22120.73 ( \u22120.76)\n\u22120.92 ( \u22120.95)\n\u22120.83 ( \u22120.81)\n\nsite Ti2\n\u22120.45 ( \u22120.48)\n\u22120.72 ( \u22120.72)\n\u22120.89 ( \u22120.90)\n\u22120.84 ( \u22120.82)\n\nthe Ob atom belonging either to the Ob row that contains VO , or to the adjacent one that contains no oxygen\nvacancy. As shown in Table II the most stable dissociative configurations are those with the protonic H atom\ntransferred to an Ob atom of an Ob row parallel to the\nrow featuring the VO site (configurations denoted \"DB\"\nin Table II and Fig. 2). The PBE+U/PBE calculations\nshow that protons prefer to bind to Ob atoms belonging\nto an Ob row in absence of VO sites, with Eads ranging\nfrom \u22120.87 to \u22120.95 eV.\nOtherwise, if we consider the case where, after water\ndissociation at a Ti5c site, a proton transfers to an Ob\natom belonging to an Ob row that includes a VO site\n(configurations denoted \"DA\" in Table II and Fig. 2),\nour calculations provide adsorption energies in the range\nof \u22120.45 to \u22120.71 eV; the same trend is observed with\nor without the inclusion of a Hubbard U term in the\ncalculations. We note that the structure with an OH\ngroup adsorbed at a Ti5c site and an H placed right at\nthe VO vacancy is unstable; the adsorption energy of this\nconfiguration Eads is positive by 2.27 eV.\nOur results show that on the reduced TiO2 (110) surface, water prefers to adsorb dissociatively onto Ti5c sites.\nOnce water molecules are molecularly adsorbed on the reduced surface, the binding energy of the surface is about\n0.1 eV higher than it is when water is dissociated on the\nsame substrate. These findings are in agreement with\nprevious studies of H2 O interaction with the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface. However, as shown based on\ncarefully converged calculations9 , molecular and dissociated configurations become essentially energetically degenerate at very low coverages, which explains why some\nstudies favor molecular adsorption whereas others yield\nthe dissociated state as the lowest energy configuration in\nthis regime10 . Most experimental works, except a recent\none106 claiming mixed adsorption, indicate molecular adsorption only. This gives rise to the well\u2013known discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental\nresults in providing a consistent and comprehensive picture of water adsorption on titanium dioxide surfaces, in\nparticular at low coverages.\nLast but not least, we focus on the interaction between\nCO and the TiO2 (110) surface. It is well known that, on\nthe stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface, the CO molecule\nadsorbs onto Ti5c sites, thus forming Ti-C bonds.

The CO binding energy has been\nfound to vary significantly with coverage and increases\nupon reaching the saturation limit. The SCS-MP2 Eads\ncomputed values are \u22120.20 eV for the full saturated surface and \u22120.36 eV for a single CO molecule adsorbed\non the surface. The PBE adsorption energy of a single\nCO molecule, \u22120.32 eV, is close to the SCS-MP2 value of\n\u22120.36 eV, and both energies are in accord with the experimental value obtained by means of thermal desorption\nspectroscopy. This demonstrates that PBE as such is\nable to describe the interaction of CO with the ideal (110)\nrutile surface in the limit of low coverages, which remains\nunaltered when using PBE+U, which gives \u22120.31 eV for\nthe adsorption energy.\n\nFIG. 3: Ball and stick model of the TiO2 (110) surface (top\nview), with site labeling.

All the structures are fully relaxed according to our aforementioned convergence criterion. The\ncomputed adsorption energies (Eads ) are compiled in Table III. Interestingly, we do not see a significant variation\nin the adsorption energies computed for different structures. The PBE+U (PBE) adsorption energy for the\nCO molecule adsorbed at the surface Ob vacancy site\nis \u22120.32 eV (\u22120.29 eV). CO adsorption at sites Ti1 and\nTi2 results in adsorption energies of \u22120.29 eV (\u22120.30 eV)\nand \u22120.33 eV (\u22120.29 eV), respectively (see Fig. 3 for site\nlabeling scheme). The computed values of Eads are in\nqualitative agreement with previous studies107,108 . We\nnote that these values are close to those obtained when\nCO is adsorbed at the VO vacancy site (\u22120.32 eV) and on\nthe stoichiometric surface39 , i.e. \u22120.31 eV (\u22120.32 eV) for\nPBE+U (PBE). When adsorbed at site Ti0, the adsorption energy of the CO molecule, computed with PBE+U,\nresults in a distinctly higher value for Eads of \u22120.22 eV\nin agreement with Ref. 108, while the corresponding\nPBE value is \u22120.28 eV, comparable to the adsorption at\nsites Ti1 and Ti2. Our PBE+U results therefore confirm\nprevious findings that CO molecules weakly interact with\nthe reduced TiO2 (110) oxide surface, Eads being of the\norder of about \u22120.3 eV (see Refs. 39,107,108). The calculations indicate that CO adsorbs at both VO vacancies\nand Ti5c sites, but while PBE calculations give similar\nenergy values for CO adsorption at VO vacancies and at\nTi0, Ti1, and Ti2 sites, the inclusion of a Hubbard U term\nsuggests that the adsorption of CO at Ti0 sites, the sites\nfacing the VO vacancy, is discouraged. In this case, the\nadsorption energy Eads is found to be \u223c 0.1 eV higher\nwhen compared to the adsorption energy values at sites\nTi1 and Ti2. Upon CO adsorption on the reduced sur-\n\nface, the charge redistribution that results from attaching\nthe molecule does not further reduce the oxide support:\nthe PBE+U calculations yield two Ti3+ ions before and\nafter adsorption, which results in an insignificant change\nin the adsorption energies when switching from PBE to\nPBE+U calculations. This behavior is confirmed by the\ncomputed electronic density of states (DOS). In Fig. 4,\nwe depict the electronic DOS and the bonding charge\ndensity \u2206\u03c1 of the structure where a CO molecule is attached at the Ti5c site (labeled site Ti2 in Fig. 3). The\nelectronic DOS features a peak in the band gap below the\nFermi level. The projected DOS (PDOS) analysis reveals\nthat this filled gap state is related to the charge localized\non two Ti\u20133d orbitals that yield the two reduced Ti3+\nsites. We conclude therefore that the binding of a CO\nmolecule does not induce a significant charge rearrangement at the CO/oxide contact site. However, as we will\nshow, the catalytic activity of the TiO2 (110) substrate\nfor efficient CO oxidation is improved by supported and\ndispersed Au adatoms on this substrate.\n\nIn conclusion, this detailed assessment convincingly\ndemonstrates that although similar trends are observed\nin the adsorption energies with or without the inclusion\nof a Hubbard U correction, the PBE+U method is seen\nto significantly improve the description of the electronic\nstructure whenever reduction occurs. In particular, the\nlocalization of excess charge on the titania substrate induced by O vacancies (F -centers) or upon H atom adsorption on bridging O atoms (hydroxylation), is correctly predicted by the PBE+U approach. Clearly, an\nadequate description of the electronic structure of such\nTiO2 (110) surfaces is crucial when dealing with metalpromoted oxide surfaces in the realm of catalysis.\n\n\f9\nIV. GOLD\u2013PROMOTED TITANIA:\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE, DYNAMICS, AND\nTHERMODYNAMICS FROM PBE+U\nA.\n\nAu adatom adsorption on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface\n\nHaving shown that the PBE+U formalism performs\nwell for a set of reference calculations on the adsorption of H, H2 O, and CO on stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 (110) surfaces, and that it significantly improves the description of reduced titania surfaces, we\nnow progress to investigating the interactions between\ngold and TiO2 (110) surfaces. The adsorption or substitution of gold induces strong charge rearrangements at the\nAu/oxide contact, which affects the electronic structure.\nOf particular interest in the realms of metal/support interactions and heterogeneous catalysis is the oxidation\nstate of Au adatoms, which is determined by the site\nwhere the metal atom is adsorbed, as well as by the\nstoichiometry of the supporting oxide. As in previous\nGGA studies7,64,66,69 , two stable adsorption sites of a\nsingle Au adatom on the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface have been identified, the two structures differing by\nonly \u223c 0.1 eV in energy. The most stable adsorption site\nfor an Au adatom deposited on this titania surface is a\nbridge site between an Ob and a Ti5c atom as depicted in\nthe central panel of Fig. 5 (B). The computed PBE+U\n(PBE) adsorption energy and the Au\u2013O / Au\u2013Ti bond\nlengths are \u22120.58 eV (\u22120.41 eV) and 2.30 (2.39) / 2.79 \u00c5\n(2.88 \u00c5 ) respectively, in agreement with previous studies7,12,64,66,69 based on standard GGA calculations; see\nTable IV for a summary.\nThe bonding charge density analysis reveals that\n0.11 |e| are transferred from the metal atom to the oxide\nsubstrate, thus indicating a very weak oxidation of Au.\nThe excess charge in the substrate is mostly localized\naround the Ob bonded to the Au adatom. This value of\nthe charge transfer has been obtained by integrating the\nbonding charge density on planes parallel to the surface\nfrom the center of the vacuum region to the center of the\nO\u2013Au\u2013Ti bond (see left panel of Fig. 5 (B)). As demonstrated by the PDOS analysis shown in the right panel\nof Fig. 5 (B), in this configuration all the Ti ions belonging to the substrate preserve their formal oxidation state\nTi4+ .\nThe second identified stable site is a top site (see central panel of Fig. 5 (C)), where the Au adatom is adsorbed on top of an Ob atom. The corresponding PBE+U\n(PBE) adsorption energy and the Au\u2013O bond length are\n\u22120.48 eV (\u22120.29 eV) and 2.00 \u00c5 (2.16 \u00c5), akin to previous GGA studies64,69 . Again, a net charge transfer from\nmetal to surface, leading to a positively charged Au\u03b4+\nion, is observed. In this case, however, the magnitude\nof the charge transfer, 0.35 |e|, is more significant, i.e.\nthree times larger than in the previous case. The excess\ncharge in the substrate is now mostly localized around\nthe surface Ob atom bound to the Au\u03b4+ and a second\u2013\n\nTABLE IV: Adsorption energies Eads (in eV) of Au and CO\nspecies on stoichiometric and reduced rutile TiO2 (110) surfaces and on the Au/TiO2 metal/support system; see text for\nlabeling.

These findings are corroborated by the computed\nDOS plotted in Fig. 5 (C), which displays two features in\nthe band gap. The projected DOS analysis reveals that\nthe filled state below the Fermi level and closest to the\nvalence band results from the charge transferred from the\nmetal to the substrate being localized on a second\u2013layer\nreduced Ti3+ atom. The unoccupied level closest to the\nconduction band is instead related to the Au\u2013O bonding.\nThe 6s levels of Au are partially empty and are located\nabove the Fermi level, leading to the Au oxidation.\n\nIn summary, the PBE+U calculations predict two\nlowest\u2013energy configurations for Au adsorption on the\nstoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface: a bridge site with the\nAu adatom adsorbed between Ob and Ti5c atoms and a\ntop site with the Au adatom adsorbed on top of an Ob\natom. Once adsorbed at the bridge site, a very weak\noxidation of the Au adatom is observed. On the other\nhand, the adsorption process of Au on top of an Ob atom\ninduces a net charge transfer from the adsorbate to the\nsubstrate, leading to the formation of a distinctly positively charged Au\u03b4+ species where about a third of an\nelectron is transferred from the metal atom to the oxide substrate. A qualitatively similar scenario has been\nobserved in recent studies of the related Au/CeO2 system109\u2013111 . However, unlike titania, with ceria the charge\ntransfer involved in the adsorption of Au on the stoichiometric oxide surface always leads to the reduction of a\nsubstrate Ce ion. In addition, the fact that the excess\ncharge \u03b4\u2212, stemming from Au in the present case, localizes on a second\u2013layer Ti ion is in line with our recent\nfindings on reduced titania surfaces13 .\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 5: Electronic structure analyses (based on the PBE+U approach) of an Au adatom (B) supported by the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface in the bridge position, (C) supported by the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface in the top position, (D)\nadsorbed on a surface VO vacancy on the TiO2 (110) surface, and (E) substituting a surface Ti5c atom in the presence of a\nsurface VO vacancy in a bridging position on the TiO2 (110) surface (see Fig. 9).

Right panels show the total DOS and atom resolved projected DOS (PDOS) as indicated,\nwhere energy values are with respect to the Fermi level, which is marked by a solid vertical line.\n\n\f11\nB.\n\nAu adatom diffusion on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface\n\nSeveral previous theoretical studies7,67,68 explored the\nPES of a single Au adatom deposited on the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface or adsorbed onto a VO vacancy site\nusing static calculations, including nudged elastic band\n(NEB) mappings112 . A key finding of these investigations is that the PES for Au migration is quite flat, with\nlow energy barriers. This indicates that Au might diffuse rather easily on the stoichiometric surface. The estimated values of the energy barriers7,67,68 agree with the\nexperimental observation of facile Au diffusion on the oxide surface even at temperatures as low as 140 K, as well\nas the estimates for the binding energy of 0.5 eV and\nsmall migration barriers of 0.07 eV (see Refs. 12,50).\nInspired by these findings, we decided to perform explicit dynamics using unconstrained ab initio molecular\ndynamics94 in order to reveal the mechanism of diffusion\nof an Au adatom on the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface. In order to probe the dynamics more efficiently, the\ntemperature of the simulations was set to T = 900 K using the Car-Parrinello scheme95 to propagate the system\nconsistently using the PBE+U functional. The selected\ntemperature is far above ambient yet sufficiently low so\nas to not decompose the surface. Thus, the phonon dynamics is accelerated and the sampling of the PES is enhanced on the picosecond AIMD time scale. As starting\nconfigurations for the AIMD simulations, we employed\none structure in which the Au adatom is adsorbed on\ntop of an Ob atom (see Fig. 5 (C) and Table IV) and a\nsecond structure where it is adsorbed in a bridge position\nbetween an Ob atom and a Ti5c atom (see Fig. 5 (B) and\nTable IV). After equilibrating the structures at 300 K for\nseveral picoseconds, the system was heated to the target\ntemperature of 900 K for the present analysis.\nLet us first consider the scenario with the Au adatom\nadsorbed on top of a surface Ob atom, labeled as site O1\nin Fig. 6, where the diffusion path of the Au adatom on\nthe stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface is visualized. During the simulation, the Au adatom diffuses in the [001]\ndirection along the row of bridging oxygen atoms, Ob .\nAdatom diffusion is mediated by the Au atom hopping\nbetween nearest\u2013neighbor oxygen atoms. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the Au adatom is originally bonded to\nthe surface bridging O1 atom with an Au\u2013O1 bond length\nof \u223c 2 \u00c5 (red line); it diffuses along the Ob row and after\n\u223c 0.75 ps reaches a configuration where it is equidistant\nbetween the O1 and O2 atoms. Then it jumps on top of\nthe row's next atom, the O2 site, where the Au\u2013O2 bond\nlength is \u223c 2 \u00c5 (green line). The Au diffusion proceeds\nalong the Ob row and at about 2 ps the Au adatom is\nshared between O2 and the next site, O3 (blue line), until\nit jumps on top of O3 forming a bond of \u223c 2 \u00c5.\nThe charge localization and charge hopping dynamics\nalong the adatom migration path is monitored by computing, as a function of time, the occupation matrix of\neach Ti d \u2013\u03b1 and d \u2013\u03b2 spin orbital along the trajectory\n\n(same analyis as in13 ). As shown in Fig. 8 the excess\ncharge donated by the Au atom to the substrate is initially localized on the second\u2013layer Ti2 site but transfers\nfrom there to site Ti3 on the sub\u2013picosecond time scale\n(at t \u223c 0.75 ps). As seen by comparing Fig. 8 to Fig. 6,\none observes that t \u223c 0.75 ps corresponds exactly to the\njump of Au from the O1 to the O2 site. A qualitatively\nsimilar scenario happens at about 2 ps which corresponds\nto the next hopping event of the Au atom from site O2 to\nO3. Thus, the motion of the surface gold adatom along\nthe row of bridging oxygen atoms, Ob , appears to be fully\ncorrelated with the localization and hopping dynamics of\nthe excess charge injected into the oxide support in the\nsecond layer of Ti atoms.\nThis dynamical scenario is distinctly different from\nwhat has been found recently for the excess charge induced by oxygen vacancies VO in the bridging row on\nthe same substrate13 . In the presence of gold adatoms,\nthe present simulations suggest a more localized configuration for the excess electron. This localized electron appears to preferentially populate sites in the vicinity of the\nAu atom and to closely follow the motion of the oxidized\nadatom. Another interesting phenomenon observed during the simulation is the absence of excess charge on the\nsubstrate at about 1.5 ps. Computing the spin density\nclose to t = 1.5 ps we observe that the charge localized at\nsecond\u2013layer Ti sites disappears from the substrate and\ngoes to the Au adatom, where it sits for a fraction of a picosecond before returning to the substrate and occupying\nthe Ti3 site. As observed in our previous work13 the excess charge populating specific second\u2013layer Ti sites and\ncoming from the Au adatom adsorbed on top of Ob atoms\nmigrates easily by phonon\u2013assisted (thermally activated)\nhopping to other Ti sites.\nNext we consider the situation where the Au adatom\nis initially adsorbed at a bridge position between an Ob\natom and a Ti5c atom (see Fig. 7). There it forms two\nbonds with the O1 and Ti1 atoms, with Au\u2013O1 and Au\u2013\nTi1 bond lengths of \u223c 2.3 \u00c5 (red line) and \u223c 2.8 \u00c5,\nrespectively. Also in this case, the gold atom originally\nbonded to the O1 and Ti1 atoms is found to diffuse exclusively along the [001] direction. Now, however, the\ngold atom hops between pairs of nearest\u2013neighbor O and\nTi atoms. After \u223c 0.8 ps, a configuration is reached\nin which the gold atom is equidistant between the O1\nand O2 (and Ti1 and Ti2) sites before it jumps into another bridge position between the O2 (green line) and Ti2\nsites. By performing static calculations, we show that Au\nadatoms adsorbed on bridge sites do not induce reduction of the substrate (see Fig. 5 (B)), thus all the Ti ions\nof the substrate preserve their 4+ oxidation state and a\nvery weak oxidation of the Au adatom is observed. This\nis fully confirmed by the dynamical simulations: along\nthe trajectory, the Ti\u20133d orbitals are found to be empty,\nwhich implies that no localization of charge on substrate\nTi sites is observed.\nEven at an elevated temperature of 900 K, we do not\nobserve diffusion of the Au adatom in the [11\u03040] direction,\n\n\f12\nnamely from the top of Ob atoms to bridge sites between\nTi5c and Ob atoms, on the timescale of picoseconds. This\ndynamics is consistent with previous findings7,67 based on\nstatic or NEB112 calculations which predict a relatively\nhigh energy barrier, \u223c 0.35 eV, for this process to happen\ncompared to others. In conclusion, dynamical PBE+U\nsimulations demonstrate that Au adatoms diffuse highly\ndirectionally on the stoichiometric rutile (110) surface.\nThey can easily migrate either along the top of the bridging oxygen rows of the clean TiO2 (110) surface or around\nthe area between these rows from one bridging position\nto the next one along the [001] direction. We did not observe, on the picosecond timescale, translational motion\nperpendicular to this direction, e.g. from one Ob row to\na neighboring row via suitable bridging positions.\n\nC.\n\nAu adatom adsorption on the reduced\nTiO2 (110) surface\n\nStarting with the reduced TiO2 (110) surface in the\npresence of an Ob surface oxygen vacancy the Au metal\nadatom is found to adsorb preferentially at the VO vacancy. Such surface oxygen vacancies result in stable anchoring sites for Au adatoms, which bind at about 0.90 \u00c5\nabove the O vacancy site with two Ti nearest neighbors at\n2.68 \u00c5 obtained from both PBE+U and PBE. The corresponding PBE+U (PBE) calculated adsorption energies\nof \u22121.54 eV (\u22121.57 eV) are much larger than the binding to the stoichiometric surface (see Table IV), which\nis consistent (\u22121.6 to \u22121.8 eV) with previous GGA calculations68 . The strong adsorption of an Au atom at\nthe VO site entails a strong charge rearrangement at the\nAu/oxide contact. In the presence of an isolated VO vacancy, the charge neutrality of the system is maintained\nby the presence of two reduced Ti3+ ions. The bonding\ncharge distribution (see Fig. 5 (D)) shows that, upon Au\nadsorption at the VO vacancy site, the charge transfer\noccurs now from the reduced substrate to the supported\nmetal atom, thus leaving a reduced surface with a single Ti3+ ion. This indicates that the charge transferred\nfrom the reduced substrate to the adsorbate comes from\none of the two Ti3+ ions. As a result this process leads\nto the formation of a negatively charged Au\u03b4\u2212 adspecies.\nThe analysis of the DOS (see Fig. 5 (D)) now shows\nthat the charge transferred from the substrate to the Au\natom moves toward the latter's half\u2013filled 6s band, which\nturns out to be almost completely filled. In conclusion,\nthese calculations not only suggest a greatly increased\nstability of Au adatoms adsorbed onto O vacancies when\ncompared to the stoichiometric surface as a reference, but\nalso a very different chemical reactivity with respect to\nadmolecules in view of their different charge state. The\nresulting ramifications for CO activation will be discussed\nin Sec. V B.\n\nD.\n\nAu substitutional defects on the TiO2 (110)\nsurface: Aux Ti(1\u2212x) O2\u2212\u03b4\n\nAnother reaction channel of gold interacting with titania surfaces is via the chemical exchange of Ti atoms.\nWe studied the scenario where an Au atom substitutes a\nsurface Ti5c site, which we call \"Au@VTi5c \". The presence of such an Au substitutional point defect induces\na rearrangement of the neighboring atoms, leading to\nthe formation of a distorted squared planar \"AuO4 \" unit\n(see Fig. 9). In this configuration, the Au atom relaxes\noutward by 0.62 \u00c5 and is found to be coordinated by\nfour surface O atoms (at about 2.0 \u00c5). The incorporation of an Au atom into the titania surface does not yield\na change in the occupation of the Ti\u20133d states: all Ti ions\npreserve their formal oxidation state Ti4+ . However, the\nadsorption of an Au adatom into a VTi5c vacancy site\nis strongly exothermic, releasing \u22126.38 eV (or \u22126.21 eV\nwhen using PBE), shown in Table IV.\n\nThis particular defective surface is found to be extremely reactive. We have computed the energy required\nto remove one of the oxygen atoms On (n = 1, 2, 3)\nin the surface layer (see Fig. 9 for site labeling). The\natoms O1 and O3 are Ob atoms while the atom O2 is\nan in\u2013plane oxygen. Our PBE+U values for the O1,\nO2, and O3 vacancy formation energies are 1.52, 2.20,\nand 1.36 eV respectively, which is in accord with previous PBE calculations71 . For the stoichiometric, undoped\nTiO2 (110) surface, the corresponding PBE+U value of\nO\nEV\nis 2.97 eV for an oxygen vacancy, VO , in the bridging row, compared to O1 and O3 here. These values suggest that substituting a surface Ti5c atom with an Au\natom greatly weakens the binding of surface O atoms, as\nobserved in the case of CeO2 surfaces109,111 .\n\nIn Fig. 5 (E), the total DOS and PDOS of the doped\nAu@VTi5c surface is depicted in the presence of an oxygen vacancy. Here, the missing oxygen is the bridging O3 atom, O3 atom (see Fig. 9), the vacancy formation energy of which is found to be lowest (1.36 eV)\nwhen Au substitutes a Ti atom at a Ti5c site, which we\ncall \"Au@VTi5c , VO3 \". Concerning the electronic structure, the main difference between the two scenarios, i.e.\none obtained by substituting a Ti5c with an Au atom\nAu@VTi5c and the other generated by substituting a Ti5c\nwith an Au atom and by removing a surface Ob atom\nAu@VTi5c , VO3 , is related to the reduction of the oxide substrate. As we can extract from Fig. 5 (E), in\npresence of a vacancy located in a neighboring bridging\noxygen row, O3, the excess electron resulting from this\nvacancy transfers to the substrate and a filled state appears in the band gap. This gap state stems from a Ti\u20133d\norbital, thus reducing one second\u2013layer Ti ion to Ti3+ .\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 6: Side view (left panel) and top view (central panel) of the diffusion path of the Au adatom on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface at 900 K. The Au atom, initially adsorbed on top of the bridging oxygen atom O1, diffuses along the Ob\nbridging row by hopping from one oxygen to the next, O1 \u2192 O2 \u2192 O3, as visualized by the worm\u2013like trajectory.

The right\npanel shows the time evolution of the Au\u2013On and Au\u2013Tin (n=1,2) bond lengths; the dashed lines at 2.30 and 2.80 \u00c5 refer to\nthe optimized equilibrium Au\u2013O and Au\u2013Ti bond lengths, respectively.\n\nE.\n\nAb initio thermodynamics of defective\nAu/TiO2 (110) surfaces\n\nThe effects of temperature and pressure on the relative stability of Au/TiO2 metal/oxide surfaces have been\ntaken into account by employing the formalism of approximate ab initio thermodynamics, as sketched in Sec. II.\nTo this end, we compute the free energies of Au adsorption, \u2206Gads (T, p) as given by Eq. (6), and report them in\nFig. 10 as a function of the O chemical potential including a conversion to oxygen partial pressures at several\nrelevant temperatures. These free energies are measured\nrelative to the stoichiometric surface and therefore include the free energy cost of creating whatever vacancy\n\nthe gold atom may be associated with.\nAs highlighted by the colors in Fig. 10, it is possible to\nidentify four thermodynamically stable phases. The first\nphase, which holds for values of \u03bcO > \u22121.35 eV, corresponds to the scenario where a surface Ti5c atom has\nbeen replaced by an Au adatom, denoted \"Au@VTi5c \".\nIn oxidative environments, and at the reference conditions that are traditionally used in most computational studies, this structure becomes the thermodynamically most stable one. The second most stable structure thermodynamically is the one obtained by removing a surface O atom from a bridging row based on\nthe Au@VTi5c structure described above, which is called\n\"Au@VTi5c , VO3 \" since the missing Ob atom is the O3\n\n\f14\n\nFIG. 8: Side view (left panel) and top view (central panel) of the Au adatom adsorbed on top of the surface bridging oxygen\natom O1, which served as the initial configuration for the migration path depicted in Fig. 6.

At t = 0 ps, the Au adatom is bound to O1 and the excess charge is fully\nlocalized in the second subsurface layer at the Ti2 site.\n\nTi5c atom with an Au adatom, while under Ti\u2013rich conditions, the Au adatoms are preferentially adsorbed at O\nvacancies.\n\nFIG. 9: Ball and stick model of an Aux Ti(1\u2212x) O2 system\nobtained by substituting a surface Ti5c atom by an Au adatom\nin side (left) and top (right) views.\n\natom (refer to Fig. 9) We have shown that the PBE+U\nenergy required for removing the O3 oxygen atom, i.e.\nO3\nthe vacancy formation energy EV\n, from the surface of\nthe Au@VTi5c structure amounts to 1.36 eV. This is significantly lower than the required energy of 2.97 eV to\nremove an Ob atom from the ideal, stoichiometric TiO2\nsurface. Therefore the TiO2 (110) oxide surface becomes\na better oxidant when doped with gold.\nAs demonstrated in Fig. 10, the Au@VTi5c , VO3 surface structure becomes thermodynamically stable for\n\u22121.79 eV < \u03bcO < \u22121.35 eV. It turns out that\nthese two defective surface structures, Au@VTi5c and\nAu@VTi5c , VO3 , are thermodynamically stable in a wide\nrange of temperatures T and pressures p that are relevant for applications in the realm of catalysis. In contrast, the adsorption of Au adatoms on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface is thermodynamically stable only in a\nquite narrow range of values of the O chemical potential\nof \u22122.05 eV < \u03bcO < \u22121.79 eV. Finally, the adsorption\nof Au adatoms on O vacancies becomes thermodynamically stable for values of \u03bcO < \u22122.05 eV. We therefore\nconclude that under O\u2013rich conditions, the thermodynamically most stable structure is the defective surface\nstructure Au@VTi5c obtained by substituting a surface\n\nFIG. 10: Free energy \u2206Gads (T, p) for Au adsorption on stoichiometric and defective TiO2 (110) surfaces as a function of\nthe oxygen chemical potential \u2206\u03bcO ; see text for the four different phases.

GOLD\u2013PROMOTED TITANIA:\nINTERACTIONS WITH CO PROBE\nMOLECULES\nA.\n\nCO molecular adsorption on Au/TiO2 (110)\nsurfaces\n\nWe have shown that our calculations predict the two\nmost stable adsorption sites of an Au adatom adsorbed\non the stoichiometric TiO2 (110) surface, differing energetically by only \u223c0.1 eV. The lowest energy configuration is that with the Au adatom adsorbed onto a bridge\nsite between a surface Ob atom and a first\u2013layer Ti5c\natom. A detailed analysis of the electronic structure of\nthis configuration shows that all Ti ions belonging to the\nsubstrate preserve their formal oxidation state Ti4+ . The\nother stable structure consists of an Au adatom sitting\non top of an Ob atom of the (110) surface. The metal\nadsorption on an Ob top site induces a strong charge rearrangement at the metal/oxide contact and entails the\nreduction of a second\u2013layer Ti ion which becomes formally Ti3+ .\nUsing these preferred structures, we now study their\ninteraction with a CO admolecule. A CO molecule is\nplaced end\u2013on at 2.5 \u00c5 above the Au adatoms. The adsorption of the CO molecule on an Au adatom adsorbed\nat an Ob site is found to be strongly exothermic, releasing \u22122.66 eV (\u22122.33 eV using PBE; see Table IV). This\nis in accord with earlier calculations68 . In this configuration, the CO molecule is aligned with the Au adatom\nand oriented normal to the surface (see Fig. 11 (F)). The\ncomputed value of the C\u2013O bond length is 1.15 \u00c5 compared to a value of 1.14 \u00c5 of an isolated CO molecule\nusing the same approach. The PBE+U (PBE) value of\nthe distance between the Au atom and the substrate Ob\natom to which it is bonded is 1.98 \u00c5 (1.97 \u00c5), while the\nAu to C distance is 1.88 \u00c5 (1.88 \u00c5). Analysis of the PDOS\n(see Fig. 11 (F)) reveals that at this Au/TiO2 contact,\nonly one Ti3+ ion is present before and after adsorption,\nand that the excess charge populating the substrate occupies the same second\u2013layer Ti\u20133d orbital. Therefore,\nthe charge redistribution due to adsorbing a CO molecule\ndoes not further reduce the oxide support. However, the\nbonding charge analysis (also displayed in Fig. 11 (F))\nshows that the Au adatom is involved in charge depletion\n(blue areas), while both the C and O atoms accumulate\nthe resulting excess charge (red areas).\nWe now consider the interaction between a CO\nmolecule and the Au atom adsorbed onto the bridge site.\nAgain, the mechanism is exothermic by \u22122.27 eV (or\n\u22122.17 eV when using PBE instead of PBE+U). In this\nconfiguration, the CO molecule is bonded to the Au atom\nand the C\u2013O bond length is 1.15 \u00c5 as in the previous\ncase. Here, however, the CO\u2013Au structure is found to be\ntilted with respect to the surface at an angle of about 60\u25e6\n(see Fig. 11 (G)). The PBE+U (PBE) values of the distances between the Au adatom and the Ti5c atom before\nand after the adsorption of molecular CO are 2.79 (2.88)\n\nand 3.90 \u00c5 (3.88 \u00c5), respectively, while the distances\nbetween the metal and the O bridging atom before and\nafter CO adsorption are 2.30 (2.39) and 1.99 \u00c5 (2.01 \u00c5),\nrespectively. The analysis of the PDOS as depicted in\nFig. 11 (G) shows, in this case, that at the Au/TiO2\ncontact, the charge redistribution reduces the oxide support, contrary to the previous scenario. We recall that\nwhen Au is adsorbed onto a bridge site, all the substrate\nTi ions preserve their formal Ti4+ oxidation state. Upon\nCO adsorption onto the Au atom occupying a bridge position, one Ti ion is reduced. The additionally reduced\nTi3+ ion, which belongs to the first TiO2 layer, is precisely the ion that forms a bond with the Au in the bridge\nconfiguration before CO adsorption.\nThe configuration in Fig. 11 (G), where the CO\u2013Au\nstructure is tilted by \u223c 60\u25e6 with respect to the substrate,\nis used as an initial condition for a short AIMD run at\nroom temperature in order to probe dynamical instabilities. In less than 0.4 ps, the CO\u2013Au complex bends\nand sits perpendicular to the surface, therefore recovering the structure obtained upon molecular CO adsorption\non gold sitting on top of an Ob atom. The difference in\nthe binding energies for CO molecule adsorption on the\ntop and bridge configurations described above can be attributed in part to the tilting of the Au\u2013CO complex with\nrespect to the surface plane. More important, however,\nis the position of the reduced Ti3+ site. Previous studies13,79 on charge localization induced by Ob vacancies\non TiO2 surfaces have shown that excess electrons, which\nare trapped at specific Ti sites, migrate easily by phonon\u2013\nassisted hopping to other Ti atoms, thus exploring different electronic structure topologies13 . In particular, it\nwas found that the most stable sites for charge localization belong to the second subsurface layer under Ti5c\nrows. The topologies where the excess charge is shared\nbetween surface Ti5c atoms and second or third subsurface layer sites below Ti5c rows were found to be about\n0.2\u20130.3 and 0.3\u20130.4 eV higher in energy, respectively. It\nis therefore conceivable that we would observe a similar\ndynamics for excess charge de\u2013 and re\u2013localization.\n\nB.\n\nCO adsorption on Au1 /TiO(2\u2212x) (110) and\nAu2 /TiO(2\u2212x) (110) surfaces\n\nThe interaction between a CO molecule and a single\nAu adatom adsorbed at a bridging site or on top of an\nOb atom on the TiO2 (110) surface has been investigated\nabove. We now concentrate on the interaction between\nCO molecule and Au adatom adsorbed at a bridging\nO vacancy. It has been shown that the metal adatom\nstrongly interacts with this reduced oxide support. The\nresulting Au\u03b4\u2212 adatom is highly stable, considering its\nbinding energy of \u22121.54 eV. Our calculations predict a\nfairly weak interaction between molecular CO and the\nAu\u03b4\u2212 adatom. The CO molecule initially located end\u2013\non at 2.5 \u00c5 above the Au\u03b4\u2212 species is found to bind with\nabout \u22120.41 eV. This binding energy is close to an order\n\n\f16\n\nFIG. 11: Electronic structure analyses (based on the PBE+U approach) of (F) a CO molecule adsorbed on a supported Au\nadatom (originally the Au atom was adsorbed at a bridging O atom) on the TiO2 (110) surface, (G) a CO molecule adsorbed on\na supported Au adatom (originally the Au atom was adsorbed between a bridging O atom and a Ti5c atom) on the TiO2 (110)\nsurface, (H) of the Au2 dimer adsorbed onto surface and (I) a CO molecule bonded to an Au2 dimer adsorbed onto a surface\nO vacancy on the TiO2 (110) surface. The left panel represents the bonding charge \u03b4\u03c1(z) integrated over planes perpendicular\nto the surface and plotted as a function of the height from the surface. The central panel displays the bonding charge \u2206\u03c1(~r)\nat an isovalue of \u00b10.06 |e|/\u00c53 where electron accumulation and depletion are represented by red and blue areas, respectively.\nThe right panel shows the total DOS and atom resolved projected DOS (PDOS), as indicated, where energies are with respect\nto the Fermi level, which is marked by a solid vertical line.\n\n\f17\nof magnitude lower than the binding energy of the positively charged Au adatom adsorbed on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface, which binds with \u22122.66 eV.\nOur calculations show that while positively charged\nAu\u03b4+ ions supported on the TiO2 (110) surface are shown\nto activate molecular CO, negatively charged Au\u03b4\u2212 adspecies, which are incorporated into surface O vacancies,\ninteract only weakly with CO adsorbates. This is in\nline with the scenario of Au adsorbed on the CeO2 substrate109,110 , where it has been shown that the higher stability of Au adatoms adsorbed onto surface is the basis of\nthe deactivation mechanism during CO oxidation. The\noxidation mechanism proposed109 involves three steps:\nthe spillover of the CO molecule, the actual oxidation\nvia a lattice oxygen atom leading to CO2 desorption, and\nthe diffusion of the Au adatom into the newly formed O\nvacancy, which results in negatively charged Au\u03b4\u2212 adspecies that prevents the adsorption of molecular CO.\nSince the present AIMD simulations have shown that\nAu adatoms diffuse rather easily on the stoichiometric\nTiO2 (110) surface, we would expect a deactivation process with titania similar to what was observed on the\nceria surface.\nDespite the fact that CO only weakly interacts with\nnegatively charged Au\u03b4\u2212 adspecies, several theoretical\nand experimental studies suggest that VO vacancies in\nbridging oxygen rows, Ob , are active nucleation sites\nfor Aun clusters on the TiO2 (110) surface7,113,114 . It is\ntherefore expected that nucleation and growth of Aun\nclusters on the rutile surface is intimately related to the\npresence of surface oxygen vacancies. To get a glimpse,\nwe next investigated the limiting case of a gold dimer,\nAu2 , adsorbed at an Ob vacancy. The optimized structure of an Au2 dimer adsorbed onto a surface bridging\nO vacancy is depicted in Fig. 12 (a). The computed\nvalue of the adsorption energy of Au2 on the reduced\nTiO2 (110) surface, calculated with respect to the isolated Au2 molecule, is \u22121.17 eV (\u22121.19 eV with PBE).\nThe adsorption mechanism induces reduction of an additional Ti ion, leading to a gold dimer into an O vacancy\nand two second\u2013layer Ti3+ ions (see Fig. 11 (H)). The\ntwo gold atoms are located 1.20 \u00c5 above the O vacancy\nsite, whereas the distances between the Au atoms and\nthe nearest\u2013neighbor Ti atoms are 2.80 AA and the Au\u2013\nAu distance amounts to 2.51 \u00c5 compared to 2.53 \u00c5 of\nthe isolated gold dimer using the same method.\nNext, a CO molecule is positioned above the Au2 dimer\nadsorbed onto the surface O vacancy. After relaxation,\nthe CO molecule reaches the most stable configuration of\nFig. 12 (b). The computed binding energy is \u22121.22 eV\n(\u22121.00 eV using PBE), in good agreement with previous studies68 . This value is about half of that obtained\nfor adsorption of CO on a single Au adatom adsorbed\non the stoichiometric surface (\u22122.66 eV) but distinctly\nlower than the energy calculated on the Au/TiO(2\u2212x)\nsurface (\u22120.40 eV). We therefore find that a cluster as\nsmall as Au2 nucleated at an O vacancy on the reduced\nTiO2 (110) surface favors the formation of stable CO ad-\n\nsorbates. Specifically, the CO molecule binds to the Au\natom that is farthest from the O vacancy and the Au\u2013Au\ndistance elongates from 2.51 to 2.78 \u00c5. The interaction\nbetween CO and the metal oxide does not induce further\nreduction of the substrate; before and after adsorption,\ntwo reduced Ti3+ ions are present (see Fig. 11 (I)). In\nFig. 12, we plot the spin density of the Au2 dimer adsorbed on the reduced TiO2 surface (a) and the spin density after adsorbing a CO molecule to this Au2 /TiO(2\u2212x)\nmetal/oxide substrate (b). In each panel, we can see that\nboth Ti3+ ions belong to subsurface layer sites below Ti5c\nrows.\nIt is clear from these calculations that a gold \"cluster\"\nas small as the Au2 dimer adsorbed onto a bridging O\nvacancy leads to a promoted support that strongly binds\nto molecular CO. Furthermore, the step from one to two\ngold atoms greatly changes the electronic properties, thus\nlending support to the general view that the reactivity of\ngold nanoparticles nucleated at O vacancies is strongly\nsize dependent.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 12: Spin density at \u00b10.005 |e|/\u00c53 of the Au2 dimer\nadsorbed onto a surface O vacancy on the TiO2 (110) surface\n(a), and the same system after coadsorbing a CO molecule\n(b); see text.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have performed periodic density functional based\ncalculations that account for the on\u2013site Coulomb interaction via a Hubbard correction (\"GGA+U\") on stoichiometric, reduced, and gold-promoted rutile TiO2 (110)\nsurfaces. Structure optimizations, ab initio thermodynamics calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations have been carried out both using PBE+U\nand plain PBE in order to provide a broad picture on\nthe interactions of these surfaces with several catalytically important molecules.\nIn agreement with plain PBE calculations and experimental results, we find that H atoms preferentially adsorb\non surface Ob atoms of the stoichiometric surface. Adsorption of hydrogen results in its reduction and transfer\n\n\f18\nof close to one electron per H atom to the substrate. Using PBE+U, however, the electron transferred by a single H atom into the substrate localizes preferentially at\nsecond\u2013layer Ti sites (whereas plain PBE yields a delocalized state). Both PBE+U and PBE calculations show\na decrease in the adsorption energy as a function of coverage and a maximum coverage of about 60\u201370%. Oxygen\nvacancies are the preferred adsorption sites for H2 O dissociation and similar values for the adsorption energies\nof water are obtained with and without the Hubbard correction. Our PBE+U calculations predict the presence\nof two reduced Ti3+ ions before and after the adsorption of water, indicating that the adsorption of water\ndoes not further reduce the support (whereas plain PBE\nagain yields delocalized excess electrons).\nAkin to plain PBE calculations, PBE+U predicts a\nweak interaction between CO molecules and the reduced\nTiO2 substrate. The data indicate that CO adsorbs at\nboth oxygen vacancies in the bridging surface rows, Ob ,\nand fivefold coordinated titania sites in the first layer,\nTi5c . While PBE calculations give similar energy values\nfor CO at oxygen vacancies and at Ti5c , PBE+U calculations show that the adsorption of CO at those Ti5c sites\nwhich are nearest neighbors of the oxygen vacancies is\nenergetically disfavored. Upon CO adsorption on the reduced oxide, the resulting charge redistribution does not\nreduce further the titania substrate.\nAddressing next the interaction of titania with gold,\nboth PBE+U and PBE calculations predict two most\nstable adsorption sites for Au adatom adsorption on the\nstoichiometric TiO2 surface. On the one hand, once an\nAu adatom is adsorbed at a bridge site between a surface\nOb atom and a first\u2013layer Ti5c atom, PBE+U suggests\nthat all the Ti ions belonging to the substrate preserve\ntheir formal oxidation state Ti4+ , indicating a very weak\noxidation of Au. On the other hand, if the Au adatom\nis adsorbed on top of an Ob atom, a net charge transfer\nfrom the metal to surface, leading to a positively charged\nAu\u03b4+ , is observed. In this case, the metal adsorption entails the reduction of a second\u2013layer Ti ion, which formally becomes Ti3+ . Ab initio molecular dynamics reveals that gold adatoms on stoichiometric TiO2 (110) are\nvery mobile. They are found to migrate easily along the\n[001] direction, either along the top of bridging oxygen\nrows or around the area between such rows. In the former case, we observe an interesting subsurface charge\ndelocalization and relocalization dynamics of the excess\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nElectronic address: matteo.farnesi@theochem.rub.de\nPresent address: Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, Telegrafenberg, 14473 Potsdam, Germany\nC.

This is traced back to the oxidation state of the\ngold adatoms, which is determined by the site at which\nthe Au atom is adsorbed as well as by the stoichiometry\nof the substrate. Isolated Au atoms supported by the\nstoichiometric TiO2 surfaces are shown to induce a significant charge redistribution at the metal/oxide contact.\nThe calculations, both PBE+U and PBE, show positively charged Au\u03b4+ adspecies supported on the stoichiometric surface which activate CO admolecules. In stark\ncontrast, the negatively charged Au\u03b4\u2212 adspecies, which\nare incorporated into surface Ob vacancies, interact only\nweakly with the same CO molecules. We have shown that\nstructures obtained by substituting a first\u2013layer Ti5c ion\nwith an Au atom weakens the bond of surface O atoms,\nakin to recent observations with ceria. Ab initio thermodynamics mappings of the surface phase diagram predict\nthat the \"Au@VTi5c \" and \"Au@VTi5c , VO3 \" of temperatures and pressures relevant for catalytic applications.\nFinally, we have shown that although a single Au adatom\nbound to a surface O vacancy weakly binds CO, a second\ngold atom adsorbed simultaneously into the O vacancy\nleads to the formation of a gold dimer, Au2 , featuring\ndistinctly different electronic and binding properties.\nWe expect that these insights will be of great help in\nunderstanding the catalytic activity of gold-promoted titania interfaces with liquid water as used in selective oxidation reactions of more complex molecules.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Bernd Meyer and Martin Muhler\nfor fruitful discussions.
