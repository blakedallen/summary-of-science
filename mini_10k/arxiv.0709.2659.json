Optical\nmicroscope investigations showed a very interesting behaviour of smectic and nematic phases; the\nsmectic phase has fan-shaped and toric textures and the nematic phase has spherulitic domains,\nwhich disappear as the sample is further heated, the texture changing into a smooth one. Here, we\ninvestigate four oxadiazole compounds with the same structure but terminal Br-substituent. The\nbehaviour of the smectic and nematic phases is like that observed in the compounds with Cl. The\nfocus of the paper is on the growth of toric domains from the nematic melt and on the role of\ndefects in the domain structure.\n\nIntroduction\nIn a previous paper [1], hereafter referred as I, we investigated a family of mesomorphic\noxadiazoles with asymmetrical molecular structures. The family consisted of oxadiazoles [2-4],\ncontaining terminal Cl-group and phenyl-cyclohexane fragment together with biphenyl analogues.\nThe temperature range of the mesophases and the existence of a smectic phase are conditioned not\nonly by the chemical structure of the substituents, but also by their position with respect to the\noxadiazolic ring. The microscope observations, discussed in I, showed interesting smectic and\nnematic phases of the oxadiazole compounds. In the smectic phase, fan-shaped and toric textures\nhave been observed, sometimes with periodic instability in the toric domains. Moreover, it was also\nremarkable the behaviour of the nematic phase in the compounds possessing both smectic and\n1\n\n\fnematic mesophases; the nematic exhibits a texture transition, that is a change driven by the\ntemperature, of the texture observed by means of the polarised light microscope. Below the\ntemperature of the texture transition, the nematic shows spherulitic domains, similar to those\nobserved in twisted nematics close to the smectic A phase transition [5]. Above the transition\ntemperature, the nematic assumes the usual schlieren appearance. Texture transitions have been\npreviously observed inside the nematic range of some alkyloxybenzoic and cyclohexane acids [613]. The common explanation for the presence of a transition in the nematic range of\nalkyloxybenzoic acids is based on the existence of cybotactic clusters favouring a local smectic\norder in the nematic melt [14,15]. In I, we suggested the existence of cybotactic clusters in the\nnematic phase of oxadiazole compounds, clusters providing the local smectic order responsible for\nthe texture transition.\nHere we will discuss other members of the oxadiazole family, with terminal Br atom substituting\nthe Cl atom. The focus of this paper will be on the formation of toric domains in the smectic phase\nfrom the nematic melt. Because the transition on cooling from nematic in smectic phase can be\nslowly driven, a detailed record of the growth of the toric domains is possible. A clear correlation\nbetween the position of the domain walls in the nematic and of the toric structures in the smectic is\neasily recognisable. First of all, let us give a short description of the compounds.\n\nOxadiazole compounds with terminal Br substituent.\nThe members of the oxadiazole family we are discussing in this paper are those with structures\nreported in Fig.1. We investigate four samples with Br attached at a terminal phenyl ring. As in I,\nthe oxadiazole compounds, prepared by the liquid crystal research group at the Organic\nIntermediates and Dyes Institute of Moscow, have an asymmetric heterocycle structure. Table 1\nreports the transition temperatures on heating and cooling of these compounds. A noticeable\ninfluence of the molecular structure is evident from data reported in Table 1: the existence of the\nsmectic phase is influenced by the position of Br atom on the phenyl ring. The same influence was\nobserved in the compounds discussed in I. The length of the alkyl tails is playing a slight role in\nchanging the transition temperatures.\nAll the samples were inserted in the cell when the material was in the isotropic phase. The walls of\nliquid crystal cells are untreated clean glass surfaces. No treaments were done to favour planar or\nhomeotropic alignments. Spacers are not used between cell walls and then the cell thickness is few\nmicrons. The liquid crystals are heated and cooled in a thermostage and textures observed with a\npolarised light microscope. Let us start the discussion from compound S1 of Figure 1.\n\n2\n\n\fCompound S1\nThis sample has a nematic and a smectic phase. The temperature transitions are reported in the\nTable 1. The smectic phase can have different texture arrangements in the cell: in some areas of the\ncell the smectic assumes a homeotropic configuration, in other regions the texture is composed of\nfan-shaped or toric domains. The observed toric domains have a large size, approximately 0.05 mm\n(see Fig.2). The smectic fan domains have the typical features of those proposed by the images of\nthe Demus and Richter collection [16] for the smectic A fan textures. As in I, we assume then a\nsmectic A phase for these oxadiazoles.\nIn the nematic phase, in the temperature range below 150\u00b0C, on heating and on cooling, we observe\nthe presence of domains with bent contours mixed with quasi-homeotropic domains. If the\ntemperature is higher than 150\u00b0C, the homeotropic regions disappear and a planar texture grows,\noccupying the totality of the cell. The low temperature nematic texture can be considered as a sort\nof spherulitic nematic texture. We mean by spherulitic nematic texture, the particular arrangement\nof domains with bent contours that we observed in the oxadiazole compounds C and D discussed in\nI. The spherulitic texture is observed in sample S2 too and then we postpone the detailed discussion\nin the next subsection.\nA sequence of textures obtained on cooling compound S1 from the isotropic melt is shown in Fig.3:\na planar texture at high temperature, the spherulitic nematic where homeotropic regions arise, and\nthe toric domains in smectic texture. The smectic phase has a notable hysteresis on cooling,\nbecause it is observed till down 85\u00b0C. Under this temperature, the sample becomes a crystal.\n\nCompound S2\nThe sample has a nematic and a smectic phase. The temperature transitions are reported in Table 1.\nAs for compound S1, we observe a smectic phase with different textures: homeotropic with clusters\nof toric domains and fan-shaped domains. In this case too, we suppose a smectic A phase. A\nnoticeable hysteresis of the smectic phase is displayed by the sample on cooling, because smectic is\nobserved till down 80\u00b0C. In the temperature range of the nematic phase, below 175\u00b0C, on heating\nand on cooling, we observe a nematic with spherulitic domains. It is not possible to find a welldefined texture transition temperature in the nematic range, but between 175 and 180\u00b0C the texture\nturns into a planar one. To have a good recording of the transition, we chose a region with a small\nspherulitic domain in the homeotropic black: the Fig.4 shows the texture change as temperature\nincreases. Fig.5 is instead representing how the nematic phase with spherulitic domains transforms\nitself into a toric smectic texture. The transition is rather slow, occupying approximately one\ndegree.\n3\n\n\fS1 and S2 behave like compounds C and D, as shown in I. In that paper we discussed the nematic\nphase with texture transitions inside, from the low temperature nematic sub-phase with spherulitic\narrangement of domains, into the high temperature sub-phase where domains disappear and the\ntexture becomes smooth. The spherulitic texture is due to a splay-bend configuration of the nematic\ndirector, giving domains with bent contours. As previously told, a reasonable explanation for the\nexistence of a texture transition is the presence in nematic melts of cybotactic clusters with local\nsmectic order. Let us imagine these clusters of molecules as seeds of smectic order in the nematic\nfluid. In the previous paper we invoked the presence of such clusters also in the oxadiazole\ncompounds displaying the texture transitions. The local smectic order would be responsible for a\nspherulitic nematic texture: this means that the nematic phase exhibits different local orders at low\nand high temperatures and that the different orders are revealed by the unlike textures observed\nwith optical microscopy. When temperature is low enough, the material can achieve the smectic\norder with a texture full of toric domains.\nThe behaviour of the nematic phase of alkyloxybenzoic acids is more or less the same: the low\ntemperature nematic texture is composed of very small domains and looks like a granular pattern\nand the smectic phase has a granular structure too. A strong paramorphosis is existing between the\nlow temperature nematic phase and the smectic phase [6,7,10]. Probably, it is the role of the\nanchoring at the cell walls of cybotactic clusters, which is relevant for the paramorphosis. We will\ndeal with the paramorphosis of oxadiazole compounds in a following section, in which we shall\ndiscuss the growth of the toric domains.\n\nCompounds S3 and S4\nThese two compounds have only the nematic mesophase. In the nematic range there is no evidence\nof a texture transition. This is the same behaviour of compounds E,F and G studied in I. Because\ntexture transitions are not observed, we suppose that cybotactic clusters cannot grow in the nematic\nmelt as temperature decreases, and this is consistent with the fact that the medium does not achieve\nthe order of a smectic phase. As for compounds with Cl-substituent, the growth of local smectic\norder can be hindered by a frustration in the molecular aggregation that does not allow the\narrangement into a layered structure of molecules. The responsible can be the position of the Br (or\nCl) atom (see Fig.1).\n\nGrowth of toric domains.\nA sort of paramorphosis is existing between the low temperature nematic phase and the toric\nsmectic of the observed oxadiazole compounds. In paramorphosis, it is the anchoring of molecules\n4\n\n\fat the cell walls, which plays the main role. In this section, we discuss how toric domains are\ngrowing from the domains of spherulitic nematic. The transition from nematic into smectic for both\ncompounds, S1 and S2, can be so slowly driven, that the feature changes can be recorded without\nspecial devices.\nThe toric domain is a focal conic domain where the ellipse is degenerated in a circle and the\nhyperbola is degenerated in a straight-line [17]. The upper part of Fig.6 is a detail of the toric\ntexture of S2: in the lower part, the director field in a vertical cross-section of the cell is drawn. The\nstructure of the smectic layers is also drawn. The circle of the focal domain is parallel to the cell\nwall and it is represented in the vertical cross-section by the red line; the blue line perpendicular to\nthe cell walls is representing the degenerated hyperbola.\nLet us imagine a small part of a thin liquid crystal cell in the nematic phase, with a defect in its\nstructure. As in Fig.7 on the left, the defect can be the boundary between planar domains. Lowering\nthe temperature, the material phase changes into the smectic phase; the material must arrange itself\nin smectic planes. Of course, molecules are anchored at the cell walls and the anchoring is\npreserving the local orientation of director. From the sequence of Fig.7, it seems that the\narrangement of the molecules is maintained in the passage from nematic in smectic at: (a) the\nboundaries between the homeotropic region and a quasi-planar area, and (b) between two quasiplanar domains. In the domains then, the molecules reorient to achieve the toric structure.\nThe strong paramorphosis between the nematic and the toric textures, that is the persistence in the\nposition of boundaries between domains, could be justified by the presence of local smectic order\nin the nematic material. Phase transition approaching, the local smectic order experienced by the\ncybotactic clusters becomes the order of all the material. Smectic plane aggregations in very small\nregions, as we imagine the cybotactic clusters, can be more persistent near the cell walls and in\nparticular at defects on the wall [7]. We can imagine the defects on the walls to be responsible of\nthe position of the boundaries between domains in the nematic phase. If it is so, it is not surprising\nan evolution of the nematic texture into smectic as that shown in Fig.8. In this image, we see on\nthe left the cooling of S2 from nematic (139\u00b0C) to smectic (138\u00b0C) on a range of 1\u00b0C. On the right,\nthe corresponding images obtained after digital processing. The image processing was performed\nwith the edge filter of a commercial program. We marked in the figure some regions where there is\nan evident persistence of boundaries in the phase transition from nematic in smectic.\nThe results here reported, obtained with the compounds with Br-substituent, confirm the interesting\nbehaviour of the smectic and nematic phases in oxadiazoles. The behaviour is similar to that\nobserved in oxadiazoles with Cl-substituent. In the case of compounds with Br, it is possible to\nprecisely control the nematic-smectic transition, and then we had the opportunity to see the\n5\n\n\fevolution of toric domains. We are planning to use fast image acquisition and verify the behaviour\nin Cl-substituted compounds.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Sparavigna, A. Mello, B.

Domains with a large size,\napproximately 0.05 mm, can be observed (image dimensions 0.38mm x 0.5mm).\n\nFigure 3: Textures observed on cooling compound S1 from the isotropic melt. The image shows on\nthe left the planar texture at a high temperature at 205\u00b0C. We see, in the middle, the spherulitic\nnematic at 145\u00b0C, and on the right the toric domains of the smectic phase at 90\u00b0C. The texture\ntransition from planar to spherulitic texture in the nematic range is at 150\u00b0C.\n\nFigure 4: The texture transition in the nematic melt of compound S2, on heating. The image shows\na region with a small spherulitic domain in homeotropic black: at the transition temperature of\n175\u00b0C, homeotropic texture changes in planar.\n\nFigure 5: The sequence shows how the nematic phase of S2, with spherulitic domains at 121\u00b0C,\ntransforms itself in toric smectic texture. The transition is rather slow, occupying in approximately\none degree.\n\nFigure 6: Toric domains of smectic S2 in the upper part of the figure. The director field in a vertical\ncross-section of the cell is drawn in the lower part of the image. The structure of the smectic layers\nis also drawn. The circle of the focal domain, parallel to cell walls, is represented by the red line;\nthe blue line perpendicular to the cell walls is representing the degenerated hyperbola.\n\nFigure 7: The arrangement of domains is maintained passing from nematic in smectic phase, as\nshown by the sequence of cooling compound S2, from 121\u00b0C (left) to 120\u00b0C (right), in the upper\npart of the image. The molecular anchoring at the walls is preserving the position of boundaries\nbetween domains. In the lower part of figure, the drawing sketches the director fields passing from\nnematic to smectic in two different cases. Case (a) shows the director field in a quasi-planar region\nsurrounded by a homeotropic area, and case (b) the field between two quasi-planar domains. In the\ndomains, the molecules reorient to achieve the toric structure.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 8: Evolution of the nematic texture into smectic for compound S1. On the left the cooling of\nS2 on a range of 1\u00b0C form 139 to 138\u00b0C. On the right, the corresponding images obtained with an\nedge filtering. Some regions where the domain boundaries are persistent in the phase transition are\nmarked in red.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 1\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 2\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 6\n\n14\n\n\fFigure 7\n\n15\n\n\fFig.8\n\n16\n\n\f"}
