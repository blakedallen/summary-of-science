The majorization order on Rn induces a natural partial ordering on the\nspace of univariate hyperbolic polynomials of degree n. We characterize all linear\noperators on polynomials that preserve majorization, and show that it is sufficient\n(modulo obvious degree constraints) to preserve hyperbolicity.\n\n1. Introduction and main result\nA polynomial in R[z] is hyperbolic if it has only real zeros. The space Hn of all hyperbolic\npolynomials of degree n is equipped with a natural partial ordering defined in terms of the majorization order on weakly increasing vectors in Rn . If x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and\n, . . . , yn ) are\nPn y = (y1P\nn\nweakly increasing vectors in Rn , then y majorizes x (denoted x \u227a y) if i=1 xi = i=1 yi , and\nPk\nPk\ni=0 yn\u2212i for each 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 2. Given a polynomial p \u2208 Hn arrange the zeros\ni=0 xn\u2212i \u2264\n(counting multiplicities) of p in a weakly increasing vector Z(p) \u2208 Rn . If p, q \u2208 Hn we say that p\nis majorized by q, denoted p \u227a q, if p and q have the same leading coefficient and Z(p) \u227a Z(q). In\nparticular if p \u227a q, then the top two coefficients of p and q are the same. The majorization order\non Hn was studied in [1, 2, 3, 6, 12]. Particular interest has been given to the question of which\nlinear operators on polynomials preserve majorization. The purpose of this note is to characterize\nsuch operators.\nLet Rn [z] be the linear space of all real polynomials of degree at most n. A linear operator\nT : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] preserves majorization if T (p) \u227a T (q) whenever p, q \u2208 Hn are such that p \u227a q.\nRecall that two hyperbolic polynomials have interlacing zeros if\nx1 \u2264 y1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 y2 \u2264 * * *\n\nor\n\ny1 \u2264 x1 \u2264 y2 \u2264 x2 \u2264 * * * ,\n\nwhere x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 * * * and y1 \u2264 y2 \u2264 * * * are the zeros of p and q, respectively. We say that a\npolynomial p(z1 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 C[z1 , . . . , zn ] is stable if it is nonzero whenever all variables have positive\nimaginary parts. A linear operator T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is called degenerate if dim(T (Rn [z])) \u2264\n2. The \u0001symbol of a linear operator T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is the bivariate polynomial FT (z, w) =\nP\nn\nn\nk\nn\u2212k\n. The following theorem is our main result and will be proved in the next\nk=0 k T (z )w\nsection.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is a linear operator, where n \u2265 1. Then T preserves\nmajorization if and only if\n(1) T is nondegenerate P\nand T (Hn ) \u2286 Hm for some m, or\n(2) T is of the form T ( nk=0 ak z k ) = an T (z n) + an\u22121 T (z n\u22121), where T (z n) 6\u2261 0 is hyperbolic,\nand either T (z n\u22121 ) \u2261 0 or T (z n\u22121 ) is a hyperbolic polynomial which is not a constant\nmultiple of T (z n ), and T (z n\u22121 ) and T (z n ) have interlacing zeros.\nMoreover, condition (1) is equivalent to that T is nondegenerate, and FT (z, w) or FT (z, \u2212w) is\nstable and such that deg(T (z n )) > deg(T (z k )) for all k < n.\n1\n\nCorresponding author\nPB is a Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Research Fellow supported by a grant from the Knut and Alice\nWallenberg Foundation.\n2\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTheorem 1 complements [4] where the authors characterized all linear operators on polynomials\npreserving hyperbolicity. Also, Theorem 1 answers in the affirmative several questions raised in\n[2, 3].\n2. Proof of Theorem 1\nWe will use the algebraic characterization of hyperbolicity preservers obtained in [4]:\nTheorem 2. Suppose that T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is a linear operator, where n \u2265 1. Then T preserves\nhyperbolicity if and only if\n\u2022 T is degenerate and is of the form\nT (p) = \u03b1(p)P + \u03b2(p)Q,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 : Rn [z] \u2192 R are linear functionals and P, Q are hyperbolic polynomials with\ninterlacing zeros, or\n\u2022 T is nondegenerate and FT (z, w) is stable, or\n\u2022 T is nondegenerate and FT (z, \u2212w) is stable.\nSuppose first that T is degenerate. If T is as in (2) of Theorem 1, then T preserves hyperbolicity\nby Obreshkoff's theorem, see e.g. [4, Theorem\nP 10]. Also, T (p) = T (q) whenever p \u227a q which proves\nthat (2) is sufficient. Note that if p = nk=0 ak z k \u2208 Hn , then an (z + an\u22121 /nan )n \u227a p. Hence\nif T preserves majorization, then the degree and the top two coefficients of T (f ) only depend on\nthe top two coefficients of p. Since T is of the form T (p) = \u03b1(p)P + \u03b2(p)Q, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\nfunctionals (by Theorem 2) it is not hard to see that T has to be of the form (2). Henceforth, we\nassume that T is nondegenerate. We start by proving that (1) is sufficient.\nLemma 3. Suppose that T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is a nondegenerate linear operator preserving hyperbolicity. Then there are numbers 0 \u2264 K \u2264 L \u2264 M \u2264 N \u2264 n such that\n(1) T (z k ) \u2261 0 if k < K or k > N ;\n(2) deg(T (z k+1 )) = deg(T (z k )) + 1 for all K \u2264 k < L;\n(3) deg(T (z k )) \u2264 deg(T (z L )) = deg(T (z M )) for all L \u2264 k \u2264 M , and\n(4) deg(T (z k+1 )) = deg(T (z k )) \u2212 1 for all M \u2264 k < N .\nProof. By Theorem 2, either FT (z, w) or FT (z, \u2212w) is stable. The lemma is a simple consequence\nof the fact that the support of a stable polynomial is a jump system, see [5, Theorem 3.2].\n\u0003\nRemark 1. Suppose that T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] is a nondegenerate linear operator such that T (Hn ) \u2286\nHm . Since any hyperbolic polynomial of degree at most n is the limit of degree n polynomials,\nit follows from Hurwitz' theorem on the continuity of zeros that T preserves hyperbolicity. But\nthen L = M = N = n, since otherwise one could produce two polynomials p, q \u2208 Hn such that\ndeg(T (p)) 6= deg(T (q)).\nTo any nondegenerate hyperbolicity preserver, we associate a sequence {\u03b3k (T )}nk=0 by defining\n\u03b3k (T ) to be the coefficient in front of z r+k in T (z k ), where r = deg(T (z K )) \u2212 K and K is as\nin Lemma 3. We claim that the linear operator \u0393 : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] defined by \u0393(z k ) = \u03b3k (T )z k\npreserves hyperbolicity. Indeed,\n\u0393(p(z)) = lim (\u03c1/z)r T (p(\u03c1z))(z/\u03c1),\n\u03c1\u21920\n\nso the claim follows from Hurwitz' theorem.\nRemark 2. It is known that such sequences have either constant sign or are alternating in sign,\nand that the indices k for which \u03b3k (T ) 6= 0 form an interval, see e.g. [7, Theorem 3.4].\nTo prove Theorem 1 we will use an important result on hyperbolic polynomials in several\nvariables. A homogeneous polynomial p \u2208 R[z1 , . . . , zn ] is said to be hyperbolic with respect to a\nvector e \u2208 Rn if p(e) 6= 0 and for all vectors \u03b1 \u2208 Rn the polynomial p(\u03b1 + et) \u2208 R[t] has only\nreal zeros. The following theorem, proved by Lewis\u2013Parrilo\u2013Ramana based heavily on the work of\nDubrovin, Helton\u2013Vinnikov and Vinnikov, settled the so called Lax conjecture.\n\n\f3\n\nTheorem 4 ([9, 10]). Let p \u2208 R[x, y, z] be a homogeneous polynomial of degree m. Then p is\nhyperbolic with respect to e = (1, 0, 0) if and only if there exist two real symmetric m \u00d7 m matrices\nB and C such that\np(x, y, z) = p(e) det(xI \u2212 yB \u2212 zC).\nTheorem 4 enables us to use the following well known convexity result in matrix theory due to\nK. Fan.\nLemma 5 ([8]). Let A be a complex Hermitian matrix of size n \u00d7 n, and denote by \u03bb1 (A) \u2264 * * * \u2264\n\u03bbn (A) its eigenvalues arranged in weakly increasing order. For each 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n the function\nA 7\u2192\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03bbn+1\u2212i (A)\n\ni=1\n\nis convex on the real space of Hermitian n \u00d7 n matrices.\nLemma 6. Let T : Rn [z] \u2192 R[z] be a nondegenerate linear operator satisfying T (Hn ) \u2286 Hm ,\nwhere n \u2265 2. Let further r(z) \u2208 Hn\u22122 be monic, and s be a fixed real number. For t \u2208 R, let\nx1 (t) \u2264 * * * \u2264 xm (t) be the zeros of the polynomial T (r(z)((z +s)2 \u2212t2 )). Then for each 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m,\nR \u220b t 7\u2192\n\nk\nX\n\n(1)\n\nxm+1\u2212i (t)\n\ni=1\n\nis a convex and even function on R. Moreover,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT r(z)((z + s)2 \u2212 t21 ) \u227a T r(z)((z + s)2 \u2212 t22 ) ,\nwhenever 0 \u2264 t1 \u2264 t2 .\nProof. Set g(z) = T (r(z)(z + s)2 ), h(z) = T (r(z)), and m = deg g. If h \u2261 0 there is nothing to\nprove so we may assume that deg h \u2265 0. Then deg h = m \u2212 2 by Remark 1. We claim that the\nhomogeneous degree m polynomial in three variables\nf (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = z3m g(z1 /z3 ) \u2212 z22 z3m\u22122 h(z1 /z3 )\nis hyperbolic with respect to the vector e = (1, 0, 0). If \u03b1 = (a, b, 0), then\nf (\u03b1 + et) = \u03b3m (T )(a + t)m \u2212 b2 \u03b3m\u22122 (T )(a + t)m\u22122\nhas only real zeros since, by Remark 2, \u03b3m (T )\u03b3m\u22122 (T ) > 0. Also, if \u03b1 = (a, b, c) where c 6= 0,\nthen\n\u0010\n\u0011\nf (\u03b1 + et) = cm T r(z)(z 2 \u2212 b2 /c2 )\nz=(a+t)/c\n\nhas only real zeros, and the claim follows.\nBy Theorem 4 there exist real symmetric m \u00d7 m matrices B and C such that\nf (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = f (e) det(z1 I \u2212 z2 B \u2212 z3 C).\nIt follows that for any fixed t \u2208 R the zeros of the polynomial\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT r(z)((z + s)2 \u2212 t2 ) = f (z, t, 1) = g(z) \u2212 t2 h(z)\nPm\nare precisely the eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix tB + C. Note also that i=1 xi (t) is\nconstant in t, since the two top coefficients of f (z, t, 1) come from g(z). The lemma now follows\nfrom Lemma 5.\n\u0003\nTo complete the proof of the sufficiency of (1) in Theorem 1 we need a well-known lemma due\nto Hardy, Littlewood and P\u00f3lya, see [11]. For simplicity, we formulate it by means of polynomials\nin Hn . Given p, q \u2208 Hn with n \u2265 2, Z(p) = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and Z(q) = (y1 , . . . , yn ) we say that\np is a pinch of q if there exist 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 and 0 \u2264 t \u2264 (yi+1 \u2212 yi )/2 such that xi = yi + t,\nxi+1 = yi+1 \u2212 t, and xk = yk for k 6= i. Note that if p is a pinch of q, then we may write p and q\nas p(z) = r(z)((z + s)2 \u2212 t21 ) and q(z) = r(z)((z + s)2 \u2212 t22 ), where r is a hyperbolic polynomials\nand s, t1 , t2 \u2208 R with 0 \u2264 t1 \u2264 t2 .\n\n\f4\n\nLemma 7. If p, q \u2208 Hn , n \u2265 2, are such that p \u227a q, then p may be obtained from q by a finite\nnumber of pinches.\nSuppose now that p \u227a q \u2208 Hn where n \u2265 2 and that T is as in (1) of Theorem 1. By Lemma 7\nthere are polynomials p = p0 , p1 , . . . , pk = q in Hn such that pi\u22121 is a pinch of pi for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nBy Lemma 6, T (pi\u22121 ) \u227a T (pi ) for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k so by transitivity T (p) \u227a T (q). The case when\nn = 1 follows from the case when n = 2 by considering the map T \u2032 defined by T \u2032 (f ) = T (f \u2032 ).\nTo prove the remaining direction in Theorem 1 assume that T preserves majorization. If\ndeg(T (z n )) > deg(T (z n\u22121 )), then by Lemma 3, deg(T (p)) = deg(T (q)) for any two polynomials\np, q of degree n. In particular T (Hn ) \u2286 Hm for some m. Assume that deg(T (z n )) \u2264 deg(T (z n\u22121 )).\nRecall that deg(T (p)) and the top two coefficients of T (p) only depend on the top two coefficients\nof p. This can only happen if deg(T (z n\u22122 )) \u2264 deg(T (z n\u22121 )) \u2212 2, since otherwise the top two\ncoefficients of T (z n \u2212 a2 z n\u22122 ) would depend on the real parameter a. But then, by Lemma 3,\nT (1) \u2261 * * * \u2261 T (z n\u22122 ) \u2261 0 and T is thus degenerate contrary to the assumptions.\nThe final sentence in Theorem 1 follows from Lemma 3 and Theorem 2.\nReferences\n[1] J.
