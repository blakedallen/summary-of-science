We argue that in the forced case the same power laws as in the decaying case\nare realized for an infinite system.\nPACS numbers: 47.27.Gs, 02.50.Ey, 05.60.-k\n\nThe Burgers equation describes an evolution of weakly\nnon-linear one-dimensional acoustic waves in the reference frame moving with the sound velocity [1]. The equation is written for the velocity u\n\u2202t u + u\u2202x u \u2212 \u03bd\u2202x2 u = f ,\n\nWe begin with the decaying case when f = 0 in Eq.\n(1), assuming a smooth initial condition u0 (x) at t = 0.\nThis case was examined by Bec and Frisch [11]. Below,\nwe reproduce their arguments in a slightly different language.\nIt is well known that Lagrangian trajectories coming\nto the shock creation points start at t = 0 from points\nwith zero second derivative u\u2032\u20320 = 0. First terms of the u0\nexpansion near such point X are\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the viscosity coefficient and f represents an\nexternal influence pumping the waves. The most interesting feature of this equation is that it describes shock\nformation.\nRecently statistical properties of solutions of the Burgers equation (1) have attracted a considerable attention,\nsince it is a simple model which could demonstrate some\nfeatures of developed turbulence [2]. Then one assumes a\nlarge value of the Reynolds number Re = V L/\u03bd, where V\nand L are characteristic velocity and length of the largescale motion. One can treat decaying (f = 0) or forced\nturbulence. In the decaying case statistics of u is timedependent, whereas it is expected to be stationary, if the\npumping force f is a process statistically homogeneous\nin space and time. We consider both possibilities.\nAn object, mainly treated in papers devoted to Burgers\nturbulence, is the PDF P1 (\u03be) of the velocity derivative\n\u03be = u\u2032 . This PDF is strongly asymmetric. The right tail\nof the PDF decays fast in accordance with the inviscid\nlaw ln P1 \u221d \u2212\u03be 3 [3\u20135]. The inviscid left tail entailed a\ncontroversy. Different values of the exponent \u03b1 for this\ntail P1 \u221d |\u03be|\u2212\u03b1 were proposed in the works [4,6\u201311], see\nalso the discussion in [12,13]. Below we confirm the validity of the answer \u03b1 = 7/2, claimed in [9,11], for the\nforced case in an infinite system.\nWe assume that the system size L is much larger than\nL. Then the PDF of the velocity derivative \u03ben = u(n)\ncan be written as the space average\nZ\nPn (t, \u03ben ) = L\u22121 dx \u03b4[\u03ben \u2212 u(n) (t, x)] .\n(2)\n\ns\nu0 \u2248 v + \u03c3(x \u2212 X) + (x \u2212 X)3 .\n6\n\n(3)\n\nThe shock is produced provided \u03c3 < 0 and s > 0. Clearly,\nthe contribution to the integral (2) related to the shock\nis independent of X and v. Therefore the integral (2) is\nrewritten as\nZ\nZ\nN\nPn (t, \u03ben ) =\nd\u03c3 ds P(\u03c3, s) dx \u03b4[\u03ben \u2212 u(n) ] , (4)\nL\nwhere P(\u03c3, s) is the PDF of the parameters \u03c3, s in the\npoints Xi and N is their number. The integral over x in\nEq. (4) is taken over a vicinity of the shock formation\npoint related to the initial velocity profile (3). To be precise, a number of Lagrangian trajectories, starting from\nthe points Xi , are \"eaten\" by shocks, already formed, before coming to the shock creation point. Such points Xi\nhave to be excluded from the consideration, that leads to\na t-dependence of both N and P(\u03c3, s) in Eq. (4).\nThe shock is formed at t = |\u03c3|\u22121 . If |\u03c3|t < 1 then we\ncan use the characteristics method, which enables one to\nwrite u(t, x) in the parametric form\nx = y + ut ,\n\ns\nu = \u2212|\u03c3|y + y 3 .\n6\n\nOne can explicitly take the integral over x in Eq. (4)\npassing to integration over y. For large \u03be corresponding\nto 1 \u2212 |\u03c3|t \u226a 1 we get\nr\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u0014\nZ\n2\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 |\u03c3|t)\n,\ndx \u03b4[\u03be \u2212 u ] =\ns |\u03be|3 t5/2 t|\u03be|\n\nThe expression is the starting point of our consideration.\nIt is argued in the works [9,11,14] that the inviscid left\ntail of P1 (\u03be) is related to the pre-shock regions. These\nvicinities possess some universal properties enabling to\nestablish the PDF (2).\n\nwith the restriction 1 \u2212 |\u03c3|t < (t|\u03be|)\u22121 (otherwise the\nintegral is zero). Then the integration over \u03c3 leads to\n1\n\n\fP1 (\u03be) \u223c\n\nN\n1\n4\nL t |\u03be|7/2\n\nZ\n\nds\n\u221a P(\u2212t\u22121 , s) .\ns\n\nP1 (\u03be) \u223c\n\n(5)\n\nThus we reproduce the answer obtained in the\nworks [9,11]. Analogously, the inviscid Khanin law\n|\u03ben |\u2212(3n+4)/(3n\u22121) (written in [11]) can be obtained.\nNow we proceed to investigating the forced Burgers\nturbulence. We consider the force f continuously distributed over time and space and having a homogeneous\nstatistics. Then the statistics of \u03ben is also homogeneous\nin time. We assume that f is smooth both in space and\ntime.\nAs previously, we are interested in vicinities of the\nshock formation points. Let us consider a prehistory\nof the u evolution during the time t before the shock\ncreation point, where L/V \u226b t \u226b |\u03be|\u22121 . The first inequality enables one to neglect the pumping force during\nthe evolution. The second condition ensures the validity\nof the expansion (3) for examining the shock formation.\nThus, we return to the expression (5), where P(\u03c3, s) is\nthe PDF of \u03c3 = u\u2032 and s = u\u2032\u2032\u2032 in points where u\u2032\u2032 = 0,\nu\u2032 < 0, u\u2032\u2032\u2032 > 0, this PDF is stationary in the pumping\ncase. However, there is a problem related to an explicit\ndependence of the answer on the auxiliary time t. Let us\ndemonstrate, that such dependence is really absent.\nThe inequalities imposed on the evolution time t mean\nthat the values 1 \u226a \u03c3L/V, sL3 /V are relevant in the\nintegral (5). We assume also \u03c3L/V, sL3 /V \u226a Re1/2 . In\nthis range one can neglect both pumping and the viscous\nterm in Eq. (1). Then we get from Eq. (1) a closed system of dynamical equations for \u03c3 = u\u2032 and s = u\u2032\u2032\u2032 (at\nthe condition u\u2032\u2032 = 0), leading to the following equation\nfor their PDF\n\u0001\n(6)\n\u2202t P = \u2202\u03c3 \u03c3 2 P + \u2202s (4\u03c3sP) ,\n\nZ\n\ndz\nF (z) .\nz 3/2\n\n(8)\n\nWe observe that the auxiliary time t drops from the\nexpression. Thus, we reproduce the law |\u03be|\u22127/2 for\nthe pumping case. The same procedure gives the law\n|\u03ben |\u2212(3n+4)/(3n\u22121) for high derivatives.\nWe are grateful to G.
