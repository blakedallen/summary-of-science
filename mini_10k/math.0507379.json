Tabachnikov's conjecture\narXiv:math/0507379v1 [math.MG] 19 Jul 2005\n\nA.I. Nazarov, F.V. Petrov\nS. L. Tabachnikov's conjecture is proved: for any closed curve \u0393 lying inside convex closed planar curve\n\u03931 the mean absolute curvature T (\u0393) exceeds T (\u03931 ) if \u0393 6= k\u03931 . An inequality T (\u0393) \u2265 T (\u03931 ) is proved for\ncurves in a hemisphere.\n\n1. Problem setting. Main ideas\nLet \u0393(s), s \u2208 [0, L(\u0393)] be a naturally parametrized closed curve on a plane. We say that \u0393(s) belongs\n\nto the class BV 1 if the velocity \u0393\u2032 (s) exists and is continious on [0, L(\u0393)] with the exception of\ncountable set; at the points of this set \u0393\u2032 has left and right limits and the variation of \u0393\u2032 is bounded1 .\nFull variation of \u0393\u2032 is called full rotation of the curve \u0393 and it is denoted by V (\u0393).\nNote the following properties of the full rotation:\n1\u25e6 . For C 2 -smooth curves the full rotation is equal to the integral of curvature modulus with\nrespect to natural parameter.\n2\u25e6 . Full rotation of a closed polygonal line equals the sum of external angles in all its vertices.\n3\u25e6 . Full rotation of a closed convex curve exists and equals 2\u03c0.\nDefine the mean absolute curvature of a curve \u0393 \u2208 BV 1 as its full rotation divided by the length:\n\nT (\u0393) = V (\u0393)/L(\u0393).\n\nS.L. Tabachnikov [1] has formulated the following conjecture which he called DNA inequality:\nTheorem P. 1. Mean absolute curvature T (\u0393) of a closed curve \u0393 \u2208 BV 1 (\"DNA\") lying inside\n\nconvex closed curve \u03931 (\"cell\") is not less than T (\u03931 ).\n\n2. If T (\u0393) = T (\u03931 ), then curve \u0393 is a multiple circuit of \u03931 .\nA survey of results concerning this conjecture and generalisations is made in [1]. The first part\nof Theorem P is proved in [2].\n\nWe prove DNA inequality in full generality. The proof of the first part partially follows the\n\nstrategy of [2], but it is more clear and it is used for proving the second part. In order to make a\npaper self-completed, we give (significantly simplified) proofs of all lemmas from [2] being used.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that \u03931 is a convex hull boundary of \u0393.\ne is said better than a curve \u0393 if T (\u0393) \u2265 T (\u0393),\ne and it is said strictly better if T (\u0393) > T (\u0393).\ne\nA curve \u0393\n\nWe call an improvement (resp. strict improvement) of a curve the replacement of a curve onto a\n1\n\nThe variation of a function f mapping into unit circle is defined as supremum of sums\n\nPn\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c1(f (ti ), f (ti\u22121 )) +\n\n\u03c1(f (tn ), f (t0 )) taken by all subdivisions t0 < t1 < * * * < tn of a segment in which f is defined provided f is defined in\n\nthe nodes ti ; \u03c1 is intrinsic metrics of the circle.\n\n\fbetter (resp. strictly better) one provided the convex hull of \"new\" curve is not larger than the\nconvex hull of \"old\" one. Note that if after some improvements of a curve \u0393 we get a multiple circuit\nof \u03931 then Claim 1 of Theorem P is proved for a curve \u0393. If, moreover, at least one improvement is\nstrict then the strict inequality T (\u0393) > T (\u03931 ) is established.\n\nAt first Claim 1 is reduced to the case of polygonal lines. After that vertices of a polygonal line\nare moved to a boundary (here and further: a boundary of a convex hull). After that each change\nof rotation admits an imrovement of a curve. A finite number of such improvements lets us to get a\ncurve, which rotates in only one direction (say, only clockwise), for which Claim 1 is almost obvious.\nThen we prove that every curve different from the multiple circuit of a boundary may be strictly\nimproved. This proves Claim 2.\n\n2. Reduction to a polygonal line\nConsider a point of jump of the function \u0393\u2032 . Note that the variation of \u0393\u2032 does not change if we\nredefine \u0393\u2032 at this point as arbitrary vector lying on the unit circle between2 left and right limits of\n\u0393\u2032 . Further, speaking about the values set of a velocity on some subinterval, we take into account\nthat we add to it these sets of admissible values in jump points mentoned above. So, the values set\nof velocity on any interval is an arc of unit circle.\nWe need the following\nLemma 1. Consider two points A and B on a curve \u0393. A full rotation of curve \u0393 between A\nand B (such part of \u0393 will be denoted by \u0393AB ) is not less than \u03c1(\u0393\u2032 (A), e) + \u03c1(\u0393\u2032 (B), e), where e is\na unit vector directed as AB.\nProof. If a vector e lies in the value set of \u0393\u2032 at the part from A to B then the claim is clear\n(it suffices to consider a subdivision of \u0393AB with nodes A, B and a point C with \u0393\u2032 (C) = e). In the\nopposite case, the values set of \u0393\u2032 from A to B is an arc not less than semicircle (otherwise one could\nfind a half-plane which contains this values set and does not contain AB). Consider a subdivision\nof \u0393AB , with nodes at points with extremal velocities. We get that the rotation of \u0393 from A to B is\nnot less than the larger arc between \u0393\u2032 (A) and \u0393\u2032 (B). This proves Lemma in this case.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2. Assume that a curve \u0393 does not satisfy Claim 1 of Theorem P. Then there exists a\n\npolygonal line, which also does not satisfy this claim.\n\nProof. By our assumprions we have T (\u0393) < T (\u03931 ). We inscribe a polygonal line \u2206 into \u0393 so\nthat the length of \u2206 is quite closed to the length of \u0393 (namely, L(\u2206) > L(\u0393) *\n\nconvex hull of \u2206 (by \u22061 we denote its boundary) lies inside \u03931 .\n2\n\ni.e. on smaller of two arcs.\n\nT (\u0393)\n).\nT (\u03931 )\n\nClearly, the\n\n\fTo prove that V (\u2206) \u2264 V (\u0393) it suffices to sum up the inequalities of Lemma 1 with respect to all\n\nedges of a polygonal line, and then to use the triangle inequality.\nHence\nT (\u2206) =\n\nV (\u0393) T (\u03931 )\nV (\u2206)\n<\n*\n= T (\u03931 ) \u2264 T (\u22061 ),\nL(\u2206)\nL(\u0393) T (\u0393)\n\nand Lemma follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet A1 A2 . . . An A1 be a closed polygonal line. We denote by L its length, by P the perimeter of\nP\nits convex hull and by V := ni=1 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai Ai+1 ) its full rotation (enumeration of indices is cyclic\n\nmodulo n). We assume that no vertex Ai of a polygonal line lies on a segment [Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ]. Such\nvertices may appear in a process of improvement, in this case they will be removed immediately.\n\nIn terms of above notations, Claim 1 of Theorem P for polygonal lines may be reformulated as\n\nfollows:\n\nL\nP\n\u2264\n.\nV\n2\u03c0\nNote that Lemmas 2 and 3 imply Claim 1 in the general case.\n\nLemma 3.\n\n3. Quadrilaterals\nHere we prove two lemmas, which form a claim of Lemma 3 for quadrilaterals. These lemmas will\nbe used further for improvement of arbitrary polygonal line.\nLemma 4. For any triangle ABC the inequality\nAB + BC\nAB + BC + AC\n<\n,\n2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nholds with \u03b2 = \u2220ABC.\nProof. By the sine theorem we have\ncos( \u2220A\u2212\u2220C\n2 sin( \u2220A+\u2220C\n) cos( \u2220A\u2212\u2220C\n)\n)\n1\nsin \u2220A + sin \u2220C\nAB + BC\n2\n2\n2\n=\n\u2264\n.\n=\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nAC\nsin \u03b2\n2 sin 2 cos 2\nsin 2\nsin \u03b22\nDue to concavity of the sine on [0, \u03c0/2] we have sin \u03b22 > \u03c0\u03b2 . Hence\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2\nAB + BC\n< <\n,\nAC\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nthat is equivalent to (1).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, O be a point of diagonals intersection. Put\n\u03c6 = \u2220AOB. Then\n\nAB + BD + DC + CA\nAB + BC + CD + DA\n<\n.\n2(\u03c0 + \u03c6)\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\n\fProof. By Lemma 4 we have AB > \u03c6\u03c0 (AO +OB), CD > \u03c6\u03c0 (CO +OD). Adding these inequalities\nwe get AB + CD > \u03c6\u03c0 (AC + BD).\nAnalogously, BC + AD > (1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c0 )(AC + BD). Hence\n\u03c6 AB + CD\n\u03c6 BC + DA\n\u03c6 \u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n*\n+ (1 + ) *\n> * + (1 + ) * (1 \u2212 ) = 1.\n\u03c0 AC + BD\n\u03c0 AC + BD\n\u03c0 \u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nTherefore,\n\n\u03c6 AB + CD BC + DA\nAB + CD\n+ 1 < (1 + )(\n+\n).\nAC + BD\n\u03c0 AC + BD AC + BD\nThis inequality is equivalent to (2).\n\n\u0003\n\nStatements of Lemmas 4 and 5 are nothing more than partial cases of Lemma 3 for concave and\nselfintersecting quadrilaterals respectively.\nRemark 1. Inequalities of Lemmas 4 and 5 (with \u2264 sign) are true also for degenerate triangle\n\nABC and quadrilateral ABCD respectively.\n\n4. Vertices moving to the boundary\nHere we reduce the proof of Lemma 3 to the case, where all vertices of a polygonal line belong to\nthe boundary of its convex hull.\nAssume that a vertice Ai is situated strictly inside convex hull. Let us consider three cases.\nCase a). The line Ai Ai+1 does not separate points Ai\u22121 and Ai+2 . In this case we can strictly\nimprove a polygonal line, increasing its length without change a rotation: just move a vertice Ai\nbeyond the segment Ai\u22121 Ai while it touches either the boundary or the ray Ai+2 Ai+1 . So we get a\nbetter polygonal line with less number of vertices situated strictly inside convex hull (it may well\nbe that a total number of vertices also decreases). Similar operation is possible if Ai Ai\u22121 does not\nseparate Ai+1 and Ai\u22122 .\nCase b). Assume that the line Ai Ai+1 separates Ai\u22121 and Ai+2 while Ai Ai\u22121 separates Ai+1 and\nAi\u22122 .\nLet Ai\u22122 and Ai+2 be situated in angles supplementary (by side containing Ai ) to angles\n\u2220Ai+1 Ai\u22121 Ai and \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai+1 Ai , respectively. Then we replace edges Ai\u22121 Ai and Ai Ai+1 of a polygonal line A1 A2 . . . An to one edge Ai\u22121 Ai+1 . Assume that the old polygonal line does not satisfy the\ninequality of Lemma 3 while new one does, i.e.\nL\nP\nL \u2212 (Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 \u2212 Ai\u22121 Ai+1 )\n>\n\u2265\n,\nV\n2\u03c0\nV \u2212 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2)\nwith \u03b2 = \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai Ai+1 . Then\nP * V \u2212 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2) * P + 2\u03c0(Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 \u2212 Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ) \u2265 2\u03c0L > P * V,\n\n(3)\n\n\fhence\n2\u03c0(Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 \u2212 Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ) > 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2)P \u2265 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2)(Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 + Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ),\nand we obtain a contradiction with Lemma 4. Thus, the new polygonal line also has to be a\ncounterexample to Lemma 3, while it has less inner vertices.\nIt remains to consider case c), where, for example, the line Ai\u22121 Ai+1 separates Ai+2 and Ai (in\nthis case a vertice Ai+1 also lies strictly inside the convex hull). Without loss of generality we assume\nthat the angle Ai\u22121 Ai+1 Ai is the least for all indices i satisfying this condition. Let us replace i to\ni + 1, and consider analogous cases. The vertex Ai\u22121 lies in an angle supplementary to \u2220Ai Ai+2 Ai+1\nwith respect to Ai Ai+1 . If the vertex Ai+3 does not lie in angle vertical to Ai+1 Ai+2 Ai , the polygonal\nline may be improved as it is shown (with the change i \u2192 i + 1). In the opposite case we get a\n\ncontradiction with the choise of i: the angle \u2220Ai Ai+2 Ai+1 is less than the angle \u2220Ai Ai+1 Ai\u22121 (since\n\u2220Ai Ai+2 Ai+1 + \u2220Ai Ai+1 Ai+2 < \u2220Ai Ai+1 Ai1 + \u2220Ai Ai+1 Ai+2 ).\n\nSo, by the finite number of steps we reduce general case to the case, where all the vertices Ai of\na polygonal line A1 A2 . . . An lie on the boundary of its convex hull.\n\n5. Decreasing the number of direction changes\nFix an orientation of the plane. We say that polygonal line A1 A2 . . . An turns to the right in a vertex\nAi if the base Ai\u22121 Ai , Ai Ai+1 is negatively oriented. Otherwise (in particular, if these vectors are\ncollinear) we say that it turns to the left.\nIf the polygonal line turns to the right (or to the left) two times in succession we may replace\nan edge between these turns to the part of boundary, passed in the same direction. This operation\nimproves a polygonal line. We call it the stretching of a polygonal line.\nLemma 6. Assume that some consequent edges of our polygonal line form a full circuit of a\nboundary, and the first and the last edges coincide (i.e. the boundary is a convex polygon C1 C2 . . . Cm\nwhile a polygonal line has a part XC1 C2 . . . Cm C1 C2 Y ). Then the claim of Lemma 3 for this polygonal\nline is equiavelent to the claim of Lemma 3 for a polygonal line with this part removed (i.e. for a\npolygonal line, in which this part is replaced by just XC1 C2 Y ).\nProof. Note that perimeter of a polygonal line after circuit removing equals L \u2212 P , and its full\n\nrotation equals V \u2212 2\u03c0. The statement of Lemma 3 for the new polygonal line claims\nwhich is equivalent to the statement of Lemma 3 for the initial polygonal line.\n\nL\u2212P\nV \u22122\u03c0\n\n\u2264\n\nP\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us repeat the operation of Lemma 6 while it is possible. This process must stop while the\nnumber of edges decreases. Note that the number of changes of turns directions does not change.\n\n\fNow the polygonal line is partitioned to parts, in which all the turns have the same direction;\nand in each part all the edges (except, possibly, the first and the last) go along the boundary and,\ndue to Lemma 6, are distinct.\nLet us develop the following operation. Choose a part Ai Ai+1 . . . Ak , in which all turns are, say,\nthe left ones (namely, turns in vertices Ai+1 , Ai+2 , . . . , Ak\u22121 are left, and turns in Ai and Ak are\nright). Replace the path Ai Ai+1 . . . Ak to the part of boundary Ai ..Ak bypassing the boundary in the\nopposite (in our case - negative) direction. The number of direction changes decreases after this\noperation.\nAssume that the initial polygonal line does not satisfy the inequality of Lemma 3. Our goal is\nto prove that in this case a new polygonal line does not satisfy it as well. Six cases are possible,\nthey are determined by the order of vertices Ai , Ai+1 , Ak\u22121 , Ak while bypassing a boundary in the\npositive direction:\n1\u25e6 . Ai Ai+1 Ak\u22121 Ak ;\n2\u25e6 . Ai Ak Ai+1 Ak\u22121 ;\n3\u25e6 . Ai Ai+1 Ak Ak\u22121 ;\n4\u25e6 . Ai Ak\u22121 Ak Ai+1 ;\n5\u25e6 . Ai Ak\u22121 Ai+1 Ak ;\n6\u25e6 . Ai Ak\u22121 Ak Ai+1 .\nCases 3 and 4 are equivalent up to renaming and symmetry. Denote the length of a polygonal\nline Ai Ai+1 . . . Ak by s, and denote the length of its replacement by s\u2032 .\n1\u25e6 (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1:\n\u272f\n\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2712A\ni\n\u2702\n\u2702\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\u276f\n\n\u273f\n\u2718\n\u2718\u2718\u2718\n\nAi+1\u2745\n\n\u2732P\nPP\nq\n\u274d\n\u274d\u274d\n\u2765\n\u274d\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\nAk \u273b\n\u2746\n\n\u2220Ak\u22121 Ak Ai = \u03b2.

So, initial assumption was wrong, and Lemma 3 is proved.\nClaim 1 of Theorem P is proved as well.\n\n6. Proof of Claim 2\nAssume that a curve \u0393 is not a (multiple) boundary circuit, but T (\u0393) = T (\u03931 ). We select a finite\nnumber of points on \u0393 so that sum of velocity jumps in other points is quite small (say, less then\n\u03c0/180). A union of this finite set and a set \u0393 \u2229 \u03931 is closed. Preimage (recall that a curve is naturally\nparametrised) of its complement is a union of countable number of intervals. Consider one of these\nintervals, let it corresponds to the part of \u0393 between points A and B.\nA part \u0393CD is said to be small if the values set of velocity on this part is an arc of length at most\n\u03c0/4, and a circle with diameter CD lies strictly inside \u03931 . It is easy to see that any inner point of\n\u0393AB belongs to some small subpart.\nConsider a small part \u0393CD . Redefine, if necessary, velocities \u0393\u2032 (C) and \u0393\u2032 (D) as their right\nlimits. Define a parallelogram CP QD with vectors CP and CQ directed as extremal directions of\nthe velocity of curve \u0393 on a part \u0393CD . This parallelogram lies strictly inside \u03931 (since extremal\ndirections are quite close to the direction of vector CD).\n\n\fThere are points X and Y on \u0393CD with tangents parallel to CP and CQ, respectively. Without\nloss of generality we can say that the order of points is C \u2212 X \u2212 Y \u2212 D. Replace a part \u0393CD to a\npolygonal line CP D.\n\nNote that full rotation of \u0393CD is not less than\nv := \u03c1(\u0393\u2032 (C), \u0393\u2032 (X)) + \u03c1(\u0393\u2032 (X), \u0393\u2032(Y )) + \u03c1(\u0393\u2032 (Y ), \u0393\u2032 (D)),\nwhile the full rotation of a new part equals v. Equality holds only if \u0393 is convex from C to X, from\nX to Y and from Y to D.\nFurthermore, the length of \u0393CD does not exceed CP + P D. To prove this consider an arbitrary\npolygonal line inscribed in \u0393CD . Directions of its edges may differ between directions of vectors CP\nand CQ. So, after their rearrangement in the order monotone (in the sense of direction) from CP\ntill CQ we get a convex polygonal line C . . . D situated inside triangle CP D, and hence its length\ndoes not exceed CP + P D.\nSo, after replacement of a part \u0393CD onto a polygonal line CP D the full rotation does not decrease,\nand length does not increase, i.e. curve \u0393 improves. But it may not be strictly improved due to\nClaim 1 already proved. Hence after such replacement neither full rotation, nor length changes. The\nfirst is possible only if \u0393CD may be splitted into at most three convex parts (C \u2212 X, X \u2212 Y , Y \u2212 D).\nThe second is possible only if each of these parts is a polygonal line with at most two edges. So,\n\u0393CD is a polygonal line with at most six edges (the number of edges may be decreased, but we do\nnot need it).\nNow we fix points A\u2032 and B \u2032 on an open arc \u0393AB and cover \u0393A\u2032 B\u2032 by finite number of small parts.\nCurve \u0393 is a polygonal line on each small part, hence \u0393A\u2032 B\u2032 is a polygonal line too.\nNow we prove that if \u0393A\u2032 B\u2032 has at least four edges then \u0393 may be strictly improved. Consider\ncases of \u00a74. In the case a) we use only local structure of a polygonal line, and the same argument\nworks in our situation.\n\nIn the case b), using Claim 1 for a changed curve, we obtain the inequality analogous to (3):\nL(\u0393)\nL(\u03931 )\nL(\u0393) \u2212 (Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 \u2212 Ai\u22121 Ai+1 )\n=\n\u2265\n,\nV (\u0393)\n2\u03c0\nV (\u0393) \u2212 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2)\nhence\n2\u03c0(Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 \u2212 Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ) \u2265 2(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2)(Ai\u22121 Ai + Ai Ai+1 + Ai\u22121 Ai+1 ),\nthat contradicts Lemma 4.\nIn the case c), if Ai+2 and Ai are separated by line Ai\u22121 Ai+1 (in this case a vertex Ai+1 also\nlies strictly inside convex curve), the polygonal line may be strictly improved by replacing an edge\nAi Ai+1 to a parallel longer edge A\u2032i A\u2032i+1 k Ai Ai+1 , where Ai \u2208 [Ai\u22121 A\u2032i [, A\u2032i+1 \u2208]Ai+1 Ai+2 ].\n\nSo, \u0393A\u2032 B\u2032 is a polygonal line with at most three edges. Since A\u2032 and B \u2032 were chosen arbitrary, a\n\ncurve \u0393AB is a polygonal line with at most three edges too.\n\n\fNow we add the points of \"large turn\", excluded before, to the considered intervals. Then the\nwhole inner part of a curve \u0393 is splitted to at most countable set of polygonal lines with a finite\nnumber of edges.\nIf one of such parts contains more than one edge, the curve \u0393 may be strictly improved as it was\ndone in \u00a74.\nSo, all points of \u0393 lie either on a boundary, or on segments joining boundary points.\nAssume that the number of segments is infinite. Then there exists a sequence of segments with\nlength tending to 0 and endpoints tending to some point C \u2208 \u03931 . Let us fix a small neighborhood\n\nof the point C with full rotation of \u03931 equal to \u03c60 < \u03c0. Consider one of segments AB (A, B \u2208 \u03931 )\nlying in this neighborhood. If vectors \u0393\u2032 (A\u2212) and \u0393\u2032 (B+) are directed to different sides with respect\n\nto the line AB, then the curve \u0393 may be strictly improved by the stretching of a segment AB to\nthe boundary. It is impossible. So, the variation of \u0393\u2032 on AB is not less than \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c60 , hence the full\nvariation is infinite.\n\nSo, the curve \u0393 consists of a finite number of boundary pieces and a finite number of segments\nbetween them. If \u0393 contains return points on a boundary (since \u0393 \u2208 BV 1 there may be only a finite\n\nnumber of such points), we consider them as \"inner segments of zero length\".\n\nIf two consecutive pieces of the boundary have the same circuit direction, it admits an improvement of \u0393: just stretch the segment between them. Further, we may remove all the full circuits of a\nboundary as in Lemma 6.\nNow consider an arc \u0393AB consisting of the segment AA1 , piece of boundary \u0393A1 B1 (which has,\nsay, positive direction), and the segment B1 B. Analogously to \u00a75, replace \u0393AB to a \"negative\" arc\nof a boundary between A and B. Here we have to consider six cases of \u00a75 again, cases depend on\nthe order of points A, A1 , B, B1 in a positive circuit. For example, in the case 1\u25e6 (order AA1 B1 B),\nwe use Claim 1 for the new curve and get the inequality analogous to (4),\nL(\u0393)\nL(\u03931 )\nL(\u0393) + s\u2032 \u2212 s\n=\n\u2265\n.\nV (\u0393)\n2\u03c0\nV (\u0393) \u2212 2(\u2220A1 AB + \u2220B1 BA)\nFrom here we deduce, as in \u00a75, that the rays AA1 and BB1 meet in a point C, and\n(\u03c0 \u2212 \u2220A1 AB \u2212 \u2220B1 BA) * (CA + CB) \u2265 (\u03c0 + \u2220A1 AB + \u2220B1 BA) * AB,\nthat contradicts Lemma 4.\nAnalogous contradictions can be obtained in remaining cases. It shows that the curve \u0393 may not\nhave inner segments, and hence it is a circuit of a boundary. Now remember the circuits removed\nearlier and realize that initially \u0393 was a multiple circuit of a boundary. The statement 2 is proved.\u0003\n\n\f7. The surfaces of constant curvature\nNow we prove a statement generalizing DNA inequality to a spherical case.\nLet \u0393 be a closed curve lying in some hemisphere (here and further: of unit radius). Let the\nvariation of the right rotation V (\u0393) be finite. For the definitions we refer to [3]. Note that if\nP\n\u0393 : A1 A2 . . . An A1 is a closed polygonal line then V (\u0393) = ni=1 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai Ai+1 ) (enumeration of\n\nindices is cyclic).\n\nDefine a mean absolute geodesic curvature T (\u0393) of a closed curve on a sphere as T (\u0393) =\nV (\u0393)/L(\u0393).\nTheorem S. Let \u0393 be a closed curve in a hemisphere, and let the variation of its right rotation\n\nbe finite. Let \u03931 be a boundary of its convex hull. Then T (\u0393) \u2265 T (\u03931 ) = (2\u03c0 \u2212 S)/L(\u03931 ), where S\nis the area of the convex hull.\n\nThe plan of a proof of a Theorem S is the same as in planar case. First of all, we formulate\n\ncorresponding statement for poligonal lines.\n\nTheorem S \u2032 . Let \u0393 be a closed poligonal line in a hemisphere, and let \u03931 be a boundary of its\n\nconvex hull. If \u0393 is not multiple circuit of \u03931 then T (\u0393) > T (\u03931 ).\n\nBefore we pass to the case of quadrilaterals, we prove the following claim elaborating (in particular\ncase) the theorem of A.D. Aleksandrov on angles comparing.\nLemma 1s. Let ABC be a non-degenerate triangle on a sphere. We denote its sides by BC = a,\nCA = b, AB = c, and its angles by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 respectively. We denote by \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032 the angles of a\ntriangle with sides a, b, c on a plane. Then\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 < (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 ) + (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 ).\n\n(1s )\n\nProof. We denote a + b + c = 4S, S \u2212 a/2 = X, S \u2212 b/2 = Y , S \u2212 c/2 = Z. E = \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0\n\nis an area of triangle ABC. The inequality (1s ) is equivalent to the inequality \u03b1\u2032 > \u03b1 \u2212 E/2 or, in\nother words,\n\ntan\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n> tan(\u03b1/2 \u2212 E/4).\n2\n\n(2s )\n\nSubstituting here the formulas\nr\nsin 2Y sin 2Z\n\u03b1\ntan =\n,\n2\nsin 2X sin 2S\n\n\u221a\nE\ntan = tan S * tan X * tan Y * tan Z,\n4\ns\nYZ\n\u03b1\u2032\n=\ntan\n2\nX(X + Y + Z)\n\n(the first formula is [3, (28)], the second is [4], the third is [5, (20)]), we convert (2s ) to the inequality\ns\ns\nsin Z sin Y cos Y cos Z \u2212 sin X sin S\nYZ\nsin(2Z) sin(2Y )\n*\n<\n*\n.\n(3s )\nsin X sin S cos X cos S + sin Y sin Z\nX(X + Y + Z)\nsin(2X) sin(2S)\n\n\fSince S = X + Y + Z, we have cos(S \u2212 X) = cos(Y + Z), hence the second multiple in the left-hand\n\nside of (3s ) equals 1. Let us denote f (x) = x cot x, then (3s ) reduces to\nf (Y )f (Z) > f (X)f (X + Y + Z).\nSince f \u2032 (x) =\n\nsin(2x)\u22122x\n2 sin2 x\n\n(4s )\n\n< 0 for 0 < x < \u03c02 , the function f srictly decreases on [0, \u03c02 ]. Since all the\n\narguments in (4s ) lie in [0, \u03c02 ] (we recall that X + Y + Z = (a + b + c)/4 \u2264 \u03c0/2), we may suppose\nthat X = 0 and prove the inequality\n\nf (Y )f (Z) > f (0)f (Y + Z).\n(5s )\n\u0011\n\u0010\nsin2 (2x)\n4\n\u2032\u2032\nWe have (ln(f )) (x) = sin2 (2x) cos(2x) \u2212 4x2 . We omit an elementary proof of the inequality\n\ncos t < ( sint t )2 for t = 2x \u2208]0, \u03c0[. This shows that ln(f ) is strictly concave on [0, \u03c02 ], and (5s ) follows.\n\u0003\n\nNow we are ready to prove the analogs of Lemmas 4 and 5 on a sphere.\nLemma 2s.

We denote by \u03c6\u2032 an angle of a planar triangle with sides a, AO, BO, opposite to side a.\nThen\n\n\u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 \u2212 E1 /2\n\u03c6 \u2212 (E1 + E3 )/2\na\n>\n>\n>\n,\n(7s )\nAO + BO\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(the first inequality follows from the proof of Lemma 4, the second one \u2013 from the Lemma 1s).\nAnalogously\nc\n\u03c6 \u2212 (E1 + E3 )/2\n>\n.\nCO + DO\n\u03c0\n\n(8s )\n\n\fEstimates (7s ) and (8s ) imply that\nx :=\n\na+c\n\u03c6 \u2212 (E1 + E3 )/2\n>\n.\nm+n\n\u03c0\n\nAnalogously,\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6 \u2212 (E2 + E4 )/2\nb+d\n>\n.\nm+n\n\u03c0\nWe substitute the lower bounds for x and y to the equality\ny :=\n\nz :=\n\na+c+m+n\nx+1\n1\u2212y\n=\n=1+\n.\na+c+b+d\nx+y\nx+y\n\nSince y < 1, we get an upper bound for z. It gives (6s ).\n\n\u0003\n\nNow we briefly explain the plan of the proof of Theorem S \u2032 .\n\nArguments used in cases a) and c) of Section 4 may be transfered with minor changes (natural\n\nchanges arising due to spherical excess E play for us).\n\nIn the case b) we choose index i so that an angle vertical to \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai+1 Ai has the least area\n\nin hemisphere. Angle vertical to \u2220Ai Ai+2 Ai+1 is contained in an angle vertical to \u2220Ai\u22121 Ai+1 Ai (in\nhemisphere), since there are no conjugate points on a hemisphere. This leads to a contradiction.\nThe arguments of Section 5 are changed in the same way as ones of case c) of Section 4.\nThe deduction of Theorem S from Theorem S \u2032 . First of all we note that the curve \u0393\n\ncan be splitted into a finite number of parts without self-intersections. Really, if the part of \u0393 with\nself-intersections has sufficiently small length then its rotation is not less than \u03c0/2.\n\nLet 0 = t1 < t2 < * * * < tn < tn+1 = L(\u0393) be the nodes of this partition (we can suppose \u0393 is\n\nnaturally parametrized with the starting point in a node). Set Ai := \u0393(ti ), \u0393i := \u0393[ti ,ti+1 ] . By Theorem\n\n1 [4], for i = 1, . . . , n there exists a sequence of poligonal lines gki : [ti , ti+1 ] \u2192 S 2 (k = 1, 2, . . . )\n\ns.t. gki (ti ) = Ai , gki (ti+1 ) = Ai+1 , gki converge to \u0393i from the right, and lim sup V (gki ) \u2264 V (\u0393i ).\n\nMoreover, the directions of gki at the points Ai and Ai+1 converge to the directions (right and left,\ncorrespondingly) of the curve \u0393 at these points.\nWe denote by gk the sum of poligonal lines gki with respect to i = 1, . . . , n, and by Gk the boundary\nof the convex hull of gk . Then lim sup V (gk ) \u2264 V (\u0393). Further, L(\u0393) \u2264 lim inf L(gk ). Finally, since\n\ngk \u2192 \u0393 uniformly, then Gk \u2192 \u03931 , whence L(Gk ) \u2192 L(\u03931 ) and T (Gk ) \u2192 T (\u03931 ) . By Theorem S \u2032\nT (\u0393) \u2265 lim sup T (gk ) \u2265 lim sup T (Gk ) = T (\u03931 ).\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot transfer the statement 2 of Theorem P to the sphere.\nNote that in the Lobachevskii plane the DNA inequality is not true. To show this we consider in\nthe Lobachevskii plane a triangle ABC and a polygonal line \u0393 = ABCC1 B1 BCA with some points\n\n\fB1 \u2208 AB, C1 \u2208 AC. Then \u03931 = ABCA, and\nS(A1 B1 C1 )\nS(A1 B1 C1 )\nV (\u0393)\n=2\u2212\n<2\u2212\n.\nV (\u03931 )\nV (\u03931 )\n3\u03c0\nMoving the vertex B sufficiently far along the ray AB1 we make the quotient L(\u0393)/L(G1 ) arbitrary\nclose to 2 that gives T (\u0393) < T (\u03931 ).\nWe are grateful to V.A.
