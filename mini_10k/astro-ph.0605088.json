Evidence is summarized that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, driven on\ndifferent length scales by various energetic processes. Large-scale turbulence determines the formation of structures like filaments and shells in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium. It also regulates the formation of dense, cold molecular clouds. Molecular\nclouds are now believed to be transient objects that form on timescales of order 107\nyrs in regions where HI gas is compressed and cools. Supersonic turbulence in the\ncompressed HI slab is generated by a combination of hydrodynamical instabilities,\ncoupled with cooling. Turbulent dissipation is compensated by the kinetic energy\ninput of the inflow. Molecular hydrogen eventually forms when the surface density\nin the slab reaches a threshold value of \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 at which point further cooling\ntriggers the onset of star formation by gravitational collapse. A few Myrs later, the\nnewly formed stars and resulting supernovae will disperse their molecular surrounding and generate new expanding shells that drive again turbulence in the diffuse gas\nand trigger the formation of a next generation of cold clouds. Although a consistent\nscenario of interstellar medium dynamics and star formation is emerging many details are still unclear and require more detailed work on microphysical processes as\nwell as a better understanding of supersonic, compressible turbulence.\nKey words: interstellar medium, turbulence, molecular clouds, star formation,\ngalaxies\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSteady-state multi-phase models have dominated our picture of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in the Milky Way for a long time. According to the early model\nof Field et al. (1969) and subsequent modifications the ISM represents an\nensemble of two stable gas phases that are in thermal pressure equilibrium\nEmail address: burkert@usm.uni-muenchen.de (A. Burkert).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n15 October 2018\n\n\fwith a mean pressure of n \u00d7 T \u2248 1000 K cm\u22123 . Cold molecular clouds with\nmean densities of n \u2248 100 cm\u22123 and temperatures T \u2248 10 K are embedded\nin a warm, diffuse and partly ionized intercloud component with density n \u2248\n0.1 cm\u22123 and temperatures of order 104 K. The gas clouds contain a large\nfraction of the total mass and move as stable, dense spheroidal objects in the\nwidespread intercloud medium which on the other hand has the dominant\nvolume filling factor. Star formation would eventually heat and disperse the\nmassive clouds. New generations of small clouds form from the intercloud\nmedium by cooling instabilities (Field 1965) and subsequently grow by random\ninelastic cloud-cloud collisions (e.g. Elmegreen 1989). Already in 1977 McKee\n& Ostriker noticed that the two-phase model could not be valid as supernova\nexplosions should lead to a third, hot and tenuous gas phase. However they\nstill focussed on the importance of thermal pressure equilibrium and a steady\nstate description as the main physical constraint to evaluate the state of the\nvarious gas phases.\n\nThis situation has changed drastically in the last decade. High-resolution observations e.g. with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and more recently with the Spitzer satellite reveal a complex kinematical state and spatial\nstructure of the interstellar gas. The ISM appears to be far from hydrostatic\nequilibrium and turbulent. In fact, it is the kinetic turbulent pressure, not\nthermal pressure, that probably dominates the gas dynamics and that characteristizes its density structure and the dynamics of the various gas phases.\nTurbulence couples structures on very different scales. Molecular clouds might\njust represent the high-density tail of this hierarchy, forming in colliding gas\nflows that lead to transient local compressions that subsequently cool. We\nwill discuss below that the complex internal structure of molecular clouds\nthat determines their evolution and their condensation into stars and stellar\nclusters is also a result of turbulence, generated by various hydrodynamical\ninstabilities during the process of molecular cloud formation.\n\nWith turbulence becoming the dominant source of structure in the ISM, theoretical models lost their simplicity and equilibrium descriptions had to be\nreplaced by dynamical models where large and small scales are simultaneously considered. We are just starting to explore and understand this rich and\nenormously complex new field of astrophysics. In this short review I can only\nfocus on a few interesting topics and unsolved questions. An excellent and\ncomprehensive review of our current understanding is presented by Elmegreen\n& Scalo (2004) and Scalo & Elmegreen (2004). Reviews that focus especially\non numerical simulations of ISM turbulence are e.g. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al.\n(2000) and Ballesteros-Paredes et al. (2006). A summary of our understanding\nof star formation in turbulent clouds is given by Mac Low & Klessen (2004).\n2\n\n\fFig. 1. Characteristic velocity dispersion \u03c3 of a sample of disk galaxies as function\nof their average surface star formation rate in units of (M\u2299 yr\u22121 kpc\u22122 ) (Dib et al.\n2006). \u03c3 is almost independent of the star formation rate for typical values found\nin slowly evolving disk galaxies like the Milky Way. It rises steeply in star burst\nregions with high star formation rates.\n\n2\n\nTurbulence in the diffuse ISM\n\nIt is now a well established fact that the ISM in galactic disks is dominated by\nirregular and often supersonic gas motions (Larson 1981; Scalo 1987; Dickey\n& Lockman 1990). In most spiral galaxies HI emission lines exceed the values,\nexpected from thermal broadening, indicating turbulent velocity dispersions \u03c3\nof order 10 km/s. The velocity dispersion in galactic disks in general decreases\noutwards from \u03c3 \u2248 12-15 km/s in the inner regions to \u03c3 \u2248 4-6 km/s in\nthe outer parts. Figure 1 shows the characteristic velocity dispersion for a\nsample of galaxies as function of their surface averaged star formation rate\n(Dib et al. 2006). Note that self-regulated star formation rates that are typical\nfor Milky Way-type disk galaxies lead to velocity dispersions of order \u03c3 \u2248\n6-8 km s\u22121 , independent of the star formation rate. The diffuse ISM acts\nlike a thermostate. The situation changes drastically in situations where star\nformation is getting out of control, leading to starbursts that last a short time,\nof order 108 yrs. As shown in figure 1, the transition into the starburst regime\nis marked by a steep increase of the velocity dispersion.\n3\n\n\f2.1 Driving turbulence in the diffuse ISM\n\nSeveral physical processes, acting on different scales and injecting different\namounts of kinetic energy contribute to the driving of ISM turbulence. However, despite a large amount of numerical work in this field, the dominant energetic sources and the physical processes that convert the kinetic energy into\nturbulence are not well understood. Stars are obvious candidates. Large-scale\nexpanding gas flows could e.g. be generated by high-pressure HII regions, resulting from the UV radiation of young, massive stars (Kessel-Deynet & Burkert 2003), stellar winds or supernova explosions. Mac Low & Klessen (2004)\nargue that supernova explosions dominate the global kinetic energy input into\nthe interstellar medium. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations have tested supernova driving in galactic disks (e.g. Kim et al. 2001;\nde Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2004, 2005; Slyz et al. 2005; Mac Low et al. 2005).\nThe recent investigation by Dib et al. (2006) demonstrates that the HI gas\nvelocity dispersion saturates at values of 3 km/s for values of the supernova\nrate, ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 the Galactic value (1/57 yr\u22121 , Cappellaro et al.\n1999). It increases sharply at larger rates, reproducing the transition into the\nstarburst regime. Although the constant velocity dispersion, found at lower\nrates is promising, the actual value of 3 km/s is a factor of 2-3 lower than\nobserved. Part of this discrepancy might be due to thermal line broadening.\nHowever other feedback processes probably are also important to produce the\nobserved level of turbulence in galactic disks.\nWhat is the origin of a constant HI velocity dispersion, independent of the\nsupernova rate? Dib et al. (2006) argue that the answer lies in a dominant\ngas phase that is in a thermally unstable temperature regime between 400\nK \u2264 T \u2264 10000 K. It is produced when individual supernova remnants cool\nand are dispersed. In these regions thermal instability (Burkert & Lin 2000)\ngenerates local irregular pressure gradients that lead to HI gas flows with\ntypical velocities of order the local sound speed, corresponding to a few km/s.\nThe importance of thermal instability as a driver of turbulence in the ISM\nhas previously been discussed in details by Kritsuk & Norman (2002a,b). In\nthe starburst regime, on the other hand, supernova remnants begin to overlap\nin an early hot phase, generating a stable, hot gas component with a large\nvolume filling factor. HI flows are now directly coupled to the expansion of\nbubbles generated by multiple supernovae, leading to larger velocities that are\nhowever still subsonic with respect to the hot gas component.\nNote, that in the Milky Way this scenario would predict the existence of a\nthermally unstable gas phase with a high mass fraction (Gazol et al. 2001), in\ncontrast to previous static multi-phase models. A large fraction of interstellar\ngas in the unstable regime has indeed been observed (Dickey et al. 1977;\nHeiles 2001; Kanekar et al. 2003). As outlined by Elmegreen & Scalo (2004),\n4\n\n\fthis phase also explains the origin of large variations in observed gas pressures\nthat were puzzling in the static models (Jenkins 2004; Kim et al. 2001).\nMany physical mechanisms, not related to stellar energetic feedback, could in\nprinciple contribute to the driving of turbulence in the ISM. Clear evidence\nfor additional sources is for example the high HI velocity dispersion observed\nin the outer parts of galactic disks where star formation is negligible (Dickey\net al. 1990). Numerical simulations are just starting to explore these drivers of\nturbulence in greater details. Galactic rotation, for example, represents a huge\nreservoir of kinetic energy. Wada et al. (2002) demonstrate that the dissipation\nof turbulent energy in disks could be compensated by a combination of galactic\nshear and gas self-gravity. In addition, the coupling of galactic shear with\nmagnetic fields can trigger a magnetorotational instability (MRI; Balbus &\nHawley 1991; Sellwood & Balbus 1999). Three-dimensional simulations by\nKim et al. (2003) show that the MRI could generate velocity dispersions of\norder a few km/s which is similar to supernova driving (see also Dziourkevitch\net al. 2004). Similar values are found by Piontek & Ostriker (2004) who studied\nthe combined affect of thermal instability and MRI.\nOnly recently have galaxies in early phases of evolution been detected in deep\nimages with the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g. Cowie et al. 1995; Tran et al.\n2003; Elmegreen et al. 2004, Forster Schreiber et al. 2006). They are characterised by a few giant blue, bright clumps of sizes \u223c 500 pc where stars appear\nto form with high efficiency in a starburst mode. The clumps dominate the\ndisk light, suggesting a global gravitational disk instability and implying an\nunusually high velocity dispersion of order 30% the disk rotational velocity\n(Elmegreen 2004), corresponding to 40-60 km/s which is similar to the velocity dispersion of the thick disk component of the Milky Way. The triggering\nmechanism of this highly turbulent starburst mode in young galaxies and its\naffect on the evolution of the various galactic components and galaxy morphologies is not well understood up to now.\n\n2.2 HI holes and the complex filamentary structure of the ISM\n\nThe left panel of figure 2 shows the peak 21cm HI surface density distribution\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud (Kim et al. 1999) which reveals a complex\nnetwork of interacting filaments, shells and superbubbles. The question of\nwhich physical processes produce these holes in the LMC and other galaxies\nis not solved. Their circular shapes suggest a stellar central energy source.\nObservations however indicate that the voids especially in the outer parts of\ngalactic disks are often not a result of supernova explosions. Kim et al. (1999)\nfor example find only a weak correlation between the positions of the HI shells\nin the LMC and HII regions. Rhode et al. (1999) have studied 51 HI holes in\n5\n\n\flog Power 2D\n\nWavelength in parsecs\n1000\n100\n2D PS\n\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\nSlope =\n\u20138/3\n\u201311/3\n\n10\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nSpatial Frequency\n( = 20 pc / Wavelength )\n\nFig. 2. The left figure, provided by S.Kim (Kim et al. 1999), shows the peak 21\ncm HI surface density distribution in the Large Magellanic Cloud which nicely\ndemonstrates the existence of a complex network of filaments and shells. The right\nfigure, provided by B. Elmegreen (Elmegreen et al. 2001), shows the power spectrum\nof the HI emission in the LMC which is well fitted by a power-law of slope -3 over\n2 decades in length.\n\nthe dwarf galaxy Holmberg II (Puche et al. 1992). They show that in 86% of\nall cases the holes do not show any signature of the presence of an embedded\nstellar cluster or any sign of ongoing stellar activity. In fact, X-ray observations\nof Holmberg II show that the HI holes are often devoid of hot gas (Kerp et\nal. 2002) and therefore probably did not form by the expansion of a hot gas\nbubble, sweeping up its environment.\nDib & Burkert (2005) suggest that large HI holes can form naturally as a\ncombined result of ISM turbulence, coupled with thermal and gravitational instabilities. Their hydrodynamical simulations of large-scale driven turbulence,\nincluding cooling and heating processes as well as self-gravity can reproduce\nthe structure of shells and holes, observed in regions where no stellar activity\nis observed. For a more quantitative analyses they subdivided the gas disk\ninto rectangular cells of constant size l and determined the autocorrelation\nlengthscale of the HI surface density distribution in each cell. Averaging over\nall cells, the mean autocorrelation length scale lcr was determined as function\nof cell size l. Dib & Burkert find that lcr increases linearly with l as long as\nthe cell size is smaller than the length scale lturb on which turbulent energy is\ninjected into the ISM. Once l > lturb , the autocorrelation lengthscale becomes\nindependent of the map size. This analysis can be used to determine the scale\nof energy injection into the ISM for observed HI disks. Applying the method\n6\n\n\fFig. 3. The distribution of young stars in the Taurus molecular cloud, superimposed\nupon 12 CO emission. Most of the stars have ages of order 2 Myr despite the fact that\nthe lateral sound crossing time is of order 20 Myr (figure provided by L. Hartmann;\nsee Hartmann et al. 2001 and Hartmann 2002, 2003).\n\nto Holmberg II leads to a driving scale of lturb \u2248 6 kpc which is very puzzling\nas this scale is much larger than any known energy source in the galaxy.\n\nThe power spectra of 2D gas column densities and emission fluctuations are\noften fitted well by power-law profiles with a slope around -3 (right panel of\nFig. 2, see Elmegreen et al. 2001). This power-law extends from the largest\nto the smallest observable scales which is surprising given the fact that multiple sources of energy are likely to contribute to the driving of turbulence on\nvery different length scales. The similarity of this slope to a 2D Kolmogorov\npower spectrum (Kolmogorov 1941) of -8/3 is also not well understood as\nKolomogorov's scaling relations are striktly valid only for incompressible fluids where vortices (solenoidal modes) are the relevant dynamical structures in\ncontrast to the ISM where compressible modes leading to shocks and rarefaction waves are important. As the Fourier transform of a step function has a\n2D power-law slope of -3 (Mac Low & Klessen 2004) we might just see the\ncomplex network of interacting shock fronts. Unfortunately numerical simulations of the turbulent supersonic ISM do not have enough dynamical range\nyet to investigate this interesting question in greater details.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nTurbulence in the dense, cold interstellar medium\n\nStars form in the cold, dense molecular phase of the interstellar medium where\nclumps with masses in the stellar regime can become gravitationally unstable\nand collapse. Like the diffuse ISM, molecular clouds (MC) exhibit a wealth of\nclumpy and filamentary substructures that indicate that they are again turbulent regions, embedded and interacting with the turbulent diffuse interstellar\nmedium.\n\n3.1 The problem of star formation in a crossing time\n\nHow stars form in MC is an important unsolved question of modern astrophysics (for a review see Mac Low and Klessen 2004). Ordinary spiral galaxies\nlike the Milky Way form stars at a low, self-regulated rate. Although a large\nfraction of the visible gas is condensed in MCs with masses in the range of\n104 \u2212 106 M\u2299 that by far exceed their thermal Jeans mass, star formation\nturns out to be surprisingly inefficient (Blitz & Shu 1980). The Milky Way, for\nexample, with a total molecular gas mass of order 2\u00d7109 M\u2299 and mean molecular cloud densities of order 100 cm\u22123 , corresponding to collapse timescales of\n5 \u00d7 106 yrs, could in principle form stars with a rate of more than 100 M\u2299 /yr\nwhich is a factor of 100 larger than observed.\nSupersonic (Mach numbers: M \u2248 5-10) turbulent gas motions have been\ndetected in most cloud complexes (Larson 1981, Falgarone & Philips 1996;\nElmegreen & Falgarone 1996, Williams et al 2000) and are considered as the\nmain source for their stability and complex density structure. However numerical hydro- and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations show that supersonic\nturbulence dissipates on timescales shorter than the collapse timescale (Stone\net al. 1998; Mac Low et al. 1998). In addition, no driver of molecular cloud\nturbulence has ever been found which on the one hand suppresses star formation on the small scales while, at the same time, stabilizing giant molecular\nclouds on the large scales (Heitsch et al. 2001).\nAnother serious problem is the so called post-T Tauri problem (Hartmann\n2001, 2002, 2003; Hartmann et al. 2001): the typical age spread of young\nstellar populations is of the order of 1-3 Myrs which is surprisingly narrow,\nindicating a coherent star formation process (see however Palla et al. 2005).\nFigure 3, for example, shows the young stars observed in the Taurus complex.\nThey are aligned in 3 parallel filaments at the ridges of an irregular diffuse\ngas complex. The origin of this alignment is not understood. In addition, the\nage spread of the stars is only a few Myrs which is a factor of 10 smaller than\nthe lateral sound crossing times of the filaments. Which processes triggered\n8\n\n\fstar formation coherently along all three filaments at exactly the same time?\nFinally, almost all molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood show signs of\nstar formation which implies that they cannot be much older than a few Myrs\nas otherwise either the newly formed stellar systems should have a larger\nage spread or a larger fraction of clouds should not show signatures of star\nformation.\nIf molecular clouds condense into stars within a few Myrs the problem arises\nhow clouds with masses of 103 \u2212106 M\u2299 could form in the first place. Consider\na perturbation travelling through the ISM and sweeping up gas. Adopting\ntypical velocities of order 10 km/s, cross sections of order (10 pc)2 and densities\nof the diffuse gas that is being swept up of order 1 cm\u22123 it takes more than 107\nyrs to accumulate a total mass of 103 \u2212 104 M\u2299 . Giant molecular clouds might\nform in larger-scale spiral arms with dimensions of several 100 pc and speeds\nof order 50 - 100 km/s (Bonnell et al. 2006). Still, several 107 yrs are required\nwhich is in conflict with the above mentioned molecular cloud lifetimes.\n\n3.2 Formation of molecular clouds in converging gas flows\n\nThe arguments, presented in the previous section, indicate that molecular\ncloud formation and evolution is highly dynamical and that clouds never have\nthe time to achieve a long-term equilibrium state, supported by internal turbulence. They instead form from the turbulent diffuse ISM with their irregular\nmotions and filamentary substructures probably already imprinted at the time\nof formation. They are dispersed a few dynamical timescales later by star formation. That molecular clouds are transient dense islands in a turbulent sea\nand part of a hierarchy of structures that form in the ubiquitous colliding\nshock waves of the turbulent, diffuse ISM has already been outlined a long\ntime ago by von Weizs\u00e4cker (1951, for a summary of early work in this field\nsee Elmegreen & Scalo 2004). At that time however it was not possible to\nstudy this model with numerical methods in details.\nThe situation has changed in the meantime due to sophisticated numerical\nschemes and the availability of fast computers. The cooling and subfragmentation of dense slabs that form in colliding gas flows has now been investigated\nin details (Walder & Folini 1998, 2000; Klein & Woods 1998; Heitsch et al.\n2005, 2006; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2005; Bonnell et al. 2006). It has been\nshown that the compressed region fragments as a result of a combination of\nthermal- and hydrodynamical instabilities (non-linear thin shell instability:\nVishniac 1994; Kelvin-Helmholtz instability: Blondin & Marks 1996: thermal\ninstability: Burkert & Lin 2000; see also Hennebelle & P\u00e9rault 1999, 2000;\nKoyama & Inutsuka 2004). Figure 4 shows an example of a fragmenting, cold\ncompressed slab. Dense filamentary and clumpy HI substructures with tem9\n\n\f1.0\n\ny\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\nx\n\n2\n\nFig. 4. Formation of a turbulent, irregular dense sheet of cold gas in the interaction\nzone of two colliding gas flows with inflow velocity of 10 km/s and temperature of\n3000 K. The density distribution of the cold gas with a temperature of \u2264 300 K is\nshown. The colorbar shows the logarithm of the particle density in units of cm\u22123 .\nVectors show the velocity of the diffuse intercloud medium that moves into the inner\nregion of the cold gas complex along open channels, driving irregular turbulent flows\nin its interior.\n\nperatures of order 100 K are forming that move with irregular velocities in a\ndiffuse interclump medium. The numerical simulations show that even with\nmodest inflow speeds and completely uniform inflows, non-linear density perturbations form that could represent the seeds of structure in molecular clouds.\nThese irregular sheets and filaments might lateron collapse and fragment into\nstars (e.g. Burkert & Bodenheimer 1993; Klessen & Burkert 2000; Burkert and\nHartmann 2004). The random gas velocities within individual cold clumps are\nquite small. However the relative velocities of the cold gas clumps with respect\nto each other are highly supersonic, compared to the sound speed of the cold\ncomponent and consistent with the observed values of a few km/s. The irregular, turbulent motion of the cold gas in the slab is continuously driven by\nthe kinetic energy of the inflowing diffuse gas. This might stabilize the region\nagainst gravitational collapse as long as the inflow continues.\nIf the inflowing gas is preferentially HI, a dense irregular HI slab forms. The\nformation of molecular gas starts as soon as the HI surface density reaches\nvalues of \u03a3crit \u2248 1021 cm\u22122 (Bergin et al. 2004). For inflow speeds of 10 km/s\nthis will require timescales of order a few 107 yrs for densities of the inflowing\nmaterial of 1 cm\u22123 . The accumulated molecular cloud mass would then be of\norder 1000 M\u2299 which is typical for filamentary molecular clouds like Taurus\nin the solar neighborhood. Similar timescales are required in the larger-scale\nflows in spiral density waves that produce giant molecular cloud complexes.\nDuring the early period of proto-cloud evolution, the gas would still be atomic\nand not easily detectable. Bergin et al. (2004) show however that as soon as\n\u03a3crit is reached, the conversion into a molecular cloud takes only a few 106\n10\n\n\fyrs. In addition, the previously 100 K gas would cool down to 10 K which\ncould trigger local gravitational collapse and star formation. More work is\nrequired to detect this gas phase observationally and investigate its evolution\nwith numerical simulations.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe interstellar medium is a highly turbulent mixture of various interacting\ngas phases. The existence of turbulence is expected, given the fact that the\ntypical Reynolds numbers in the ISM are of order 104 \u2212 107 (Elmegreen &\nScalo 2004). That turbulence is however also found in regions without energy\ninput by stars is surprising.\nA wealth of connected and coupled structures on different scales all the way\ndown to the scale of star formation have been identified, starting with the early\nwork of Larson (1981) who found that the density and velocity dispersion\nof molecular clouds scales with the size of the region as a power law. This\nindicates an interesting connection between ISM dynamics and star formation.\nMany questions are still unsolved and need to be expained theoretically. This\nmight eventually lead to a quantitative model of star formation that is one of\nthe crucial missing ingredients in order to understand the evolution of galaxies.\nAcknowledgements: I would like to acknowledge inspiring discussions with\nLee Hartmann, Bruce Elmegreen, Fabian Heitsch, Nick Scoville and Sami Dib\non this topic and would like to thank Sungeun Kim, Lee Hartmann and Bruce\nElmegreen for providing figures for this review.\n\nReferences\nAlcock C. et al: 2001, ApJS 136, 439\nBahcall J.N.: 1984, ApJ 287, 926\nBalbus, S.A., Hawley, J.F.: 1991, ApJ 376, 214\nBallesteros-Paredes, J., Klessen, R.S., Mac Low, M.-M., Vazquez-Semadeni,\nE.: 2006, to appear in Protostars and Planets V, astro-ph/0603357\nBergin, E.A., Hartmann, L.W., Raymond, J.C., Ballesteros-Paredes, J.: 2004,\nApJ 612, 921\nBlitz, L., Shu, F.H.: 1980, ApJ 238, 148\nBlondin, J.M., Marks, B.S.: 1996, New Astronomy 1, 235\nBonnell, I.A., Dobbs, C.L., Robitaille, T.P., Pringle, J.E.: 2006, MNRAS 365,\n37\nBurkert, A., Bodenheimer, P.: 1993, MNRAS 264, 798\nBurkert, A., Lin, D.N.C.: 2000, ApJ 537, 270\n11\n\n\fBurkert, A., Hartmann, L.: 2004, ApJ 616, 288\nCappellaro, E., Evans, R., Turatto, M.: 1999, A & A 351, 459\nCowie, L., Hu, E., Songalia, A.: 1995, AJ 110, 1576\nde Avillez, M.A., Breitschwerdt, D.: 2004, A & A 425, 899\nde Avillez, M.A., Breitschwerdt, D.: 2005, ApJ 634, L65\nDib, S., Burkert, A.: 2005, ApJ 630, 238\nDib, S., Bell, E., Burkert, A.: 2006, ApJ 638, 797\nDickey, J.M., Salpeter, E.E., Terzian, Y.: 1977, ApJ 211, L77\nDickey, J.M., Lockman, F.J.: 1990, ARAA 28, 215\nDziourkevitch, N., Elstner, D., R\u00fcdiger, G.: 2004, A & A 423, 29\nElmegreen, B.G.: 1989, ApJ 347, 859\nElmegreen, B.G., Kim, S., Staveley-Smith, L.: 2001, ApJ 548, 749\nElmegreen, B.G.: 2004, In Penetrating bars through the masks of cosmic dust:\nthe Hubble tuning fork strikes a new note, ed.
