In the following, we will first review\nthese work, then will extend the methods developed in\nthese work to study this quantum phase transition where\nthe quasi-particles are coupled to the quantum fluctuation generated vortices.\nEmploying semi-classical approximation, Volovik\npointed out that the circulating supercurrents around\nvortices induce Doppler energy shift to the quasi-particle\nspectrum, which leads to a finite density of states at the\nnodes [1]. This effect ( Volovik effect) has been employed\nto attempt to explain the experimental observations [7]\nof longitudinal thermal conductivity \u03baxx in [2].\nStarting from BCS Hamiltonian, Anderson [3] employed the first single-valued singular gauge transformation to study quasi-particle dynamics in the mixed state.\nUnfortunately, Anderson made an incorrect mean field\napproximation which violates the \"Time-Reversal\" symmetry [6], therefore leads to the incorrect conclusion that\nthere is Landau level quantization of energy levels of the\nquasi-particle.

They did not see the\nsignature of Landau level quantization in their numerical\ncalculations\nUnfortunately, in the vortex lattice state, the vector\npotential only provides a periodic potential instead of\nscattering quasi-particles, its effect on the energy spectrum and other physical quantities is not evident.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this paper, we are trying to study the nature of\nzero temperature quantum phase transition from d-wave\nsuperconductor at x > xc to the underdoped regime at\nx < xc of the high temperature superconductors ( Fig.1).\nT\n\nT*\n\nAF\n\ndSC\nxc\n\nunderdoped regime\n\nx\nd-wave superconductor\n\nFig 1: The temperature ( T ) versus doping ( x ) diagram of\nhigh Tc cuprates.\n\nIt is well known that inside the superconductor phase\nx > xc , there are low energy quasi-particle excitations\nnear the four nodes of the Fermi surface, the quantum\nphase fluctuation of the Cooper pair condensates are suppressed, the positive and negative vortices are bound together. As the doping decreases from the right to xc , the\nphase fluctuation increases. At the underdoped regime\nx < xc , the quantum phase fluctuations are so strong\nthat they generate free hc/2e vortices, destroy the long\nrange phase coherence of the d-wave superconductor,\ntherefore the superconducting ground state. However,\nthe local short-range pairing still exists, the low energy\nquasi-particles at the four nodes remain. This quantum\nphase transition is driven by the condensation of hc/2e\nvortices. Near the transition, there are strong coupling\nbetween the quasi-particles and the phase windings of\n1\n\n\fobserved that because infinite thin hc/2e vortices do not\nbreak the T reversal symmetry, any correct mean field\ntheory should respect this T symmetry. He showed exactly there is no Landau level quantization due to this\nT symmetry. He applied the singular transformation in\nthe FT gauge to disordered vortex state and found that\nthe long-range logarithmic interaction between vortices\nsuppresses the fluctuation of superfluid velocity (scalar\npotential), but does not affect the fluctuation of the internal gauge field. Therefore the scalar field acquires a \"\nmass \" determined by the vortex density, but the gauge\nfield remains \" massless \". The quasi-particle scattering\nfrom the \"massless\" internal gauge field dominates over\nthose from the well-known \"massive\" Volovik effect and\nthe non-magnetic scattering at sufficient high magnetic\nfield. This dominant scattering mechanism is a purely\nquantum mechanical effects which was completely missed\nby all the previous semi-classical treatments [2]. In fact.\nit is responsible for the behaviors of both \u03baxx and \u03baxy in\nhigh magnetic field observed in the experiments [7].\nWhen the vortices are generated by quantum fluctuations or thermal fluctuations, themselves are moving\naround, new physics may arise. From Newton's third\nlaw, intuitively, the vortices must also feel the counteracting AB phase coming from the quasi-particles. Therefore there is a mutual AB phase scattering between vortices and quasi-particles. In this paper, we enlarge the\none singular gauge transformation developed in [3,4,6]\nto two mutual flux-attaching singular gauge transformations. We then apply them to study quasi-particles\ncoupled to moving vortices near the zero temperature\nquantum critical point. In canonical quantization, we\nperform two singular transformations which are dual to\neach other to quasi-particles and moving vortices respectively. Just like conventional singular gauge transformation leads to conventional Chern-Simon (CS) term, the\ntwo mutual singular gauge transformations lead to mutual CS term. This elegant mutual CS term precisely describe the mutual AB phase scattering between vortices\nand quasi-particles. Alternatively, in path-integral presentation, the effective action describes the quasi-particle\nmoving in both vector and scalar potentials due to the\nphase fluctuations of quantum generated vortices. By a\nduality transformation presented in Refs. [8,9] to a vortex representation, the quantum fluctuation generated\nvortices couple to quasi-particles by a mutual CS term,\nthe vortices are also interacting with each other by long\nrange logarithmic interactions due to charge fluctuation\ndescribed by a Maxwell term. By carefully considering\nthe periodicity of this mutual CS term, it can be shown\nthat the effective action is essentially equivalent to the\ndual vortex representation derived by Senthil and Fisher\n(SF) from the elegant Z2 gauge theory [10] except the\nVolovik effect missing in the Z2 gauge theory is also explicitly incorporated into the present approach. Neglecting the charge fluctuation first and replacing the Z2 mu-\n\ntual CS theory by the U (1) mutual CS theory, we find\na fixed line characterized by the mutual statistical angle\n\u03b8 and calculate the universal spinon, vortex and mutual\nHall drag conductivities which continuously depend on\n\u03b8. This transition can also be viewed as a simplest confinement and deconfinement transition. The properties\nof the confinement and deconfinement phases on the two\nsides of the critical point are also discussed. We stressed\nexplicitly that the periodicity of Z2 mutual CS gauge theory on the lattice is not preserved by the U (1) mutual CS\ntheory in the continuum. When the U (1) charge fluctuation is taken into account, we tentatively still replace the\nZ2 mutual CS theory by the U (1) CS mutual theory and\ntreat both U (1) fluctuations on the same footing. We\nfind the U (1) charge fluctuation turns the fixed line into\na fixed point where charge \u00b1e and spin 1/2 Dirac-like\nquasi-particle and charge 2e Cooper pairs are asymptotically decoupled. Although the result is pathological, it\ndoes suggest the spinon and holon are confined into electrons and Cooper pairs when condensing hc/2e vortices,\nin contrast to the condensing of double strength hc/e\nvortices discussed in [13,12] and reviewed in appendix C.\nAlthough we are unable to solve the critical behaviors\nof a combined Z2 and U (1) theory in this paper, we do\nstress that Z2 periodicity should be treated correctly to\nunderstand the critical behaviors of a theory with both\ndiscrete Z2 and continuous U (1) gauge fields.\nThe paper is organized as the following. In the next\nsection, we derive the effective action with both the mutual C-S interaction and the charge fluctuation, first in\nthe path integral language, and then in canonical quantization representation. In Sec. III, we concentrate on the\neffect of the mutual C-S interaction and calculate the\ncritical exponents and universal conductivities for general statistical angle \u03b8. Implications for double layers\nQuantum Hall System are given. Some details are relegated to appendix A. In appendix C, we concentrate on\nthe effect of charge fluctuation which is the only gauge\nfluctuation in double strength hc/e vortices. In Sec IV,\nwe discuss the combined effect of mutual C-S interaction\nand charge fluctuation, we also stress the importance to\nkeep the periodicity of Z2 gauge field when considering a\ntheory with both discrete Z2 and continuous U (1) gauge\nfields. In Sec. VI, we discuss the connection of our approach to the current fashion Z2 gauge theory and point\nout the possible open problems. In appendix B, we apply the method developed in the main text to quenched\nrandom vortex array.\nII. THE EFFECTIVE ACTION\n\nFollowing the notation in Refs. [4,6], we define d\u2191 =\nc\u2191 (x), d\u2193 = c\u2020\u2193 [18]. Because there are equal number of\npositive and negative vortices, we divide the positive vortices into two subsets \u03c6p1 , \u03c6p2 and negative vortices into\n2\n\n\ftwo subsets \u03c6n1 , \u03c6n2 . We define \u03c6A = \u03c6p1 + \u03c6n1 , \u03c6B =\n\u03c6p2 + \u03c6n2 and introduce the spinon by performing a general singular unitary transformation d = U ds :\n\u0013\n\u0012 i\u03c6\n0\ne A\n\u22121\n(1)\nHs = U HU,\nU=\n0 e\u2212i\u03c6B\n\nis explicitly SU (2) spin invariant. Equivalently, we can\nstart with the explicitly spin SU (2) invariant approach\nadvocated in Ref. [13] and perform the singular gauge\ntransformation in the p-h space.\nLqp enjoys gauge symmetry U (1)u \u00d7 Us (1) ( in\nfact, it is U (1) \u00d7 Z2 ), the first being uniform and second being staggered gauge symmetry:\nUniform (or external) Uu (1) gauge symmetry\n\nwhere \u03c6A + \u03c6B = \u03c6 is the phase of the Cooper pair. The\noriginal transformation [3,4] is devised for static vortices.\nHere we extend it to moving vortices whose phase \u03c6 is\nalso fluctuating, therefore, depends on both the space and\ntime. The spinon is charge neutral. In Anderson's gauge,\n\u03c6A = 0, \u03c6B = \u03c6 or vice versa. In the former(latter), the\nspinon is electron-like ( hole-like).\nExpanding Hs around the node 1 where p~ = (pF , 0),\nwe obtain the linearized quasi-particle Lagrangian Lqp in\nthe presence of the external gauge potential A\u03bc :\n\nc\u03b1 \u2192 c\u03b1 ei\u03c7 , d\u03b1 \u2192 d\u03b1\n\u03c6A \u2192 \u03c6A + \u03c7,\n\u03c6B \u2192 \u03c6B + \u03c7\n\nUnder this uniform U (1) transformation, the corresponding fields transform as:\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c7, A\u03b1 \u2192 A\u03b1 + \u2202\u03b1 \u03c7\nv\u03b1 \u2192 v\u03b1 ,\na\u03b1 \u2192 a\u03b1\n\nLuqp = \u03c81\u2020 [(\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 ia\u03c4 ) + vf (px \u2212 ax )\u03c4 3 + v2 (py \u2212 ay )\u03c4 1 ]\u03c81\n\nwhere v\u03bc = h\u03042 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 ec A\u03bc is the gauge-invariant superfluid momentum, it acts as a scalar scattering potential,\na\u03bc = 21 \u2202\u03bc (\u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B ) is the AB gauge field due to the\nphase winding of vortices [14]. Note that the external\ngauge potential only appear explicitly in the superfluid\nmomentum v\u03bc . Because there are equal number of positive and negative vortices in both \u03c6A and \u03c6B , on the\naverage, the vanishing of v\u03bc and a\u03bc is automatically ensured, in this case, the Anderson gauge turns out to be\nmore convenient than FT gauge.

The last\nterm is due to Berry phase in the boson representaf\ntion [9] which can be absorbed into Aef\nby redefining\n\u03bc\nef f\nef f\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + i\u03bc\u03b4\u03bc0 , it acts like an external magnetic\nfield in the \u1e91 ( namely \u03bc = 0 ) direction. There are one\nspecies of vortex and N = 4 species of Dirac fermion(\n2 spin components at 2 nodes at the upper plane), the\nmutual statistical angle \u03b8 = \u00b11/2. We also changed the\nnotation by setting a\u03c8 = av , a\u03a6 = as , ae = a.\nAlthough we derived the above equation in the\nelectron-like Anderson gauge, in fact, it holds in any\ngauge. Eq.19 again enjoys the gauge symmetry U (1) \u00d7\nU (1), the first only acting on the vortex sector is the\nelectric U (1) gauge field, the second on both the vortex\nand fermion sectors is the U (1) mutual CS gauge field.\nThe mutual Chern-Simon term enforces the constraints:\n\u03c8\nv\n2\u03c0\u03b8j\u03bcs = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03a6\n\u03bb , 2\u03c0\u03b8j\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03bb . Physically, it\nmeans that when a quasi-particle encircles a vortex, it\npicks up a phase 2\u03c0\u03b8. Equivalently when a vortex moves\naround a quasi-particle, it also picks up a phase 2\u03c0\u03b8. Although the conventional C-S term breaks T symmetry\nand has periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 2 [19\u201323], the mutual\nC-S term does not break T symmetry and has periodicity\nunder \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1. For example, \u03b8 = \u22121/2 is equivalent\nto \u03b8 = 1/2. In fact, this mutual CS term at \u03b8 = 1/2\nshould be the same as the Z2 mutual CS term on the lattice discussed in Ref. [10]. Therefore strictly speaking a\u03c8\nand a\u03a6 are Z2 gauge fields, only a\u03bc is a U (1) gauge field.\nThe Doppler-shifted term ( Volovik effect) is encoded in\nthe last term in Eq.19. This effect was not taken into\naccount in the Z2 gauge theory [10].\n\nWhere the first part coming from Cooper pair and the\nsecond from the quasi-particle.

In\nfact, as shown in the previous paragraphs, j\u03bce and j\u03bcs are\nseparately conserved. Therefore we can introduce spin\nand electric gauge fields by:\nj\u03bcs = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd as\u03bb\nj\u03bce = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd ae\u03bb\n\n(18)\n\nwhere at\u03bc = ae\u03bc \u2212 12 as\u03bc is the total gauge field felt by the\nmoving vortices.\nUsing \u03a6 for the vortex operator and adding the quasiparticle part, we get the following effective action:\n\n(13)\n\nj\u03bct =\n\n(17)\n\n(16)\n\nWe can also define the vortex current:\n4\n\n\fAll the generated terms only renormalize the short\nrange interactions already included in V (|\u03a6|). The model\nis also closely related to the Hall drag problem in double\nlayer Quantum Hall system [26], therefore the model itself is interesting on its own right and deserves detailed\ninvestigation.\n\nIn canonical quantization language, it is very instructive to compare the well-known singular gauge transformation leading to composite fermion in \u03bd = 1/2 system\nby Halperin, Lee and Read (HLR) [19] to the singular\ngauge transformations performed in the spinon-vortex\nsystem in this paper. The crucial difference is that in the\nformer, we attach electron's own \u03b8 flux to itself ( \u03b8 = 2\nin \u03bd = 1/2 system to keep fermion statistics intact ), the\nconstraint \u2207\u00d7~a(~r) = 2\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1(~r) in Coulomb gauge \u2202i ai = 0\nleads to composite fermion \u03c8c coupled to conventional\nCS term which breaks T symmetry, has periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 2; however, in the latter, we attach vortex's\n\u03b8 = 1/2 flux to quasi-particle or vise versa, the two constraints \u2207 \u00d7 ~a\u03c8 (~r) = 2\u03c0\u03b8j0v (~r), \u2207 \u00d7 ~a\u03a6 (~r) = 2\u03c0\u03b8j0s (~r)\n\u03a6\nin Coulomb gauges \u2202i a\u03c8\ni = \u2202i ai = 0 naturally leads to\nquasi-particles and vortices are coupled by mutual CS\nterm in additional to the electrical gauge field which mediates the logarithmic interaction between vortices. The\nmutual CS term does not break T symmetry, has periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1.\nIt is important to point out that when a vortex is moving around a closed loop, it pick up two phases, one is Z2\nphase due to the spinon current, described by the mutual\nC-S term, another is U (1) phase due to the total electric\ncharge current described by the Maxwell term. In the\nfollowing section, we will neglect the electric charge fluctuation and concentrate the mutual statistics term. In\nSec. IV, we will study the effect of charge fluctuation\ndescribed by the Maxwell term. For completeness, we\nrelegate the review of the effect of charge fluctuation to\nappendix B.\nFor simplicity, we take the relativistic form for both\nfermion and boson, because the anisotropies in Eq.19 are\nexpected to be irrelevant near the zero temperature QCP\n[11].\n\nA. Quantum Critical point\n\nIn order to calculate conductivities, we add two source\n\u03a6\nfields A\u03c8\n\u03bc and A\u03bc for the quasi-particles and vortex respectively:\n\u03c8\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03c8\n\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc )\u03c8a\n\u03a6\n2\n+ |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03a6\n\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc )\u03a6| + V (|\u03a6|) +\n\nwhere a = 1, 2, 3, 4 stands for N = 4 species of Dirac\nfermion. In fact, two Maxwell terms for a\u03c8 and a\u03a6 can\nbe added to the above equation, but they are subleading\nto the mutual CS term in the low energy limit. It is expected that there is no periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1 in\nthe continuum limit.\nIf the theory is properly regularized on the lattice, it\nshould has the periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1, for example, \u03b8 = \u22121/2 should be equivalent to \u03b8 = 1/2. In fact,\n\u03b8 = 1/2 mutual U (1) CS theory could be the same as the\nZ2 mutual CS theory developed in [10].\nThe RG calculation in Refs. [20\u201322] can be used to\nshow that \u03b8 is exactly marginal, therefore there is a line\nof fixed points determined by the mutual statistical angle\n\u03b8. In order to calculate the spin conductivity along this\nfixed line, a source field could be introduced to couple to\nthe spin current ~j\u03bcS = \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc (~\u03c3 )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b2 .

Experimentally, the Hall drag conductivity can be detected\nby measuring the transverse voltage drop ( or transverse\ntemperature drop for thermal conductivity ) of spinons\ndue to the longitudinal driving of vortices. The Hall\ndrag conductivity in double layer Quantum Hall systems\nhas been investigated by several authors [26]. In double\nlayer systems, the electrons in different layers are treated\nas two different species. There is a mutual CS interaction between the two species (both are fermions) which\nis directly responsible for this Hall drag conductivity, although the Coulomb interaction between the two species\nis responsible for the Coulomb ( longitudinal ) drag [27].\nThis example shows that no external magnetic field is\nneeded to produce a Hall effect ! However, \u03b8 = \u00b11/2 are\nvery special points, U (1) mutual CS term reduces to Z2\nfield, there should be no Hall drag conductivity just like\n\u03b1 = \u00b11/2 vortex leads to no Hall conductivity.\nAgain, by using the large N result of [20,21], we find\nthe anomalous dimensions of the fermion and vortex to\ntwo loops:\n\nThe result is:\ng4\nN\n(33)\n12\u03c0 2\nwhere \u03bdXY \u223c 0.672 is correlation length exponent for the\n3d XY model [24].\nIt is instructive to go to dual representation of Eq.22,\nnamely go to the boson representation:\n\u03bd = \u03bdXY \u2212\n\n\u03c6\n2\n\u03c8\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03c8\n\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc )\u03c8a + |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc )\u03c6| + V (|\u03c6|)\n1 \u03c6 2\n\u03c6\n\u03c8\n\u03c6\n\u03a6\n) + ia\u03a6\n+ (f\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd (a\u03bb \u2212 a\u03bb /\u03b8) \u2212 iA\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03bb (34)\n4\nwhere V (|\u03c6|) = m2\u03c6 |\u03c6|2 + g\u03c6 |\u03c6|4 + * * *,\nIntegrating out a\u03a6\n\u03bc leads to the constraint up to a pure\ngauge:\n\u03c6\na\u03c8\n\u03bc = \u03b8a\u03bc\n\nSubstituting the above constraint to Eq.34 and setting\na\u03c6\u03bc = a\u03bc , we find:\n1 2\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 i\u03b8a\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03c8\n\u03bc )\u03c8a + f\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n+ |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc )\u03c6|2 + V (|\u03c6|) \u2212 iA\u03a6\n\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03bb\n\n(36)\n\nThe above Eq. indicates that fermions and bosons are\ncoupled to the same gauge field whose dynamics is described by Maxwell term instead of C-S term. This Eq.\nis simply 2 + 1 dimensional combination of spinor QED\nand scalar QED. The RG analysis at 4 \u2212 \u01eb by dimensional regularization is possible, because the marginal\ndimension of all the relevant couplings are 4. However\na RG analysis directly at 2 + 1 dimension is formidable,\nthe physical meaning and the exact marginality of \u03b8 is\nobscure in the boson representation. However they are\nevident in the dual vortex representation Eq.22. It is\nevident that there is no periodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1 in\nEq.36.\nIf we perform duality transformation again on Eq.36\nto go to the vortex representation, then we recover Eq.19\nupon neglecting the two Maxwell terms relative to the\nmutual C-S term.\nIn the next subsection, setting the two source terms\nvanishing, we look at the properties of the different\nphases on the two sides of this quantum critical point.\n\n(a)\n\n+\n(b)\n\nFig 6: The two loop diagrams for the self energies of spinon (a)\nand vortex (b).

In this section, we try to consider the combined effects of Z2 mutual statistical gauge\nfluctuation and U (1) electrical gauge fluctuation. After\nreplacing the Z2 discrete gauge theory by a U (1) mutual\nCS theory, we treat U (1) mutual CS theory and U (1)\nelectrical gauge theory on the equal footing. Although\nthe replacement leads to somewhat misleading conclusions, the heuristics derivation suggests that the condensation of hc/2e vortex condensation indeed leads to the\nconfinement of spinon and chargon into Cooper pair and\nelectron, in contrast to the condensation of hc/e vortex.\nWe do not intend to understand the critical behaviors of\na combined Z2 and U (1) theory in this paper. We simply\nstress that Z2 periodicity should be treated correctly to\nunderstand the critical behaviors of a theory with both\ndiscrete Z2 and continuous U (1) gauge fields.\n\nB.

By breaking electrons and Cooper\npairs into smaller constitutes: chargons with charge e,\n(48)\n9\n\n\fspin 0 and spinons with charge 0,spin 1/2, SF introduced a local Z2 gauge degree of freedom to constrain\nthe Hilbert space to the original one. The effective action describes both chargons and spinons coupled to local fluctuating Z2 gauge theory with a doping dependent Berry phase term. By the combination of standard\nduality transformation of 3 dimensional XY model and\nthat of Z2 gauge theory, the action is mapped into a\ndual vortex representation where the hc/2e vortices and\nspinons are coupled by a mutual Z2 CS gauge theory. As\nusual vortices in XY model, the hc/2e vortices also couple to a fluctuating U (1) gauge field which mediates the\nlong-range logarithmic interaction between the vortices.\nStarting from the dual representation, the authors in\nRef. [11] studied a transition from d-wave superconductor to confined Mott insulator driven by the condensing\nof hc/2e vortices. In order to study the critical behaviors\nof this particular confinement and de-confinement transition, they replaced the Z2 mutual CS theory on the\nlattice by U (1) mutual CS theory in the continuum and\nperformed renormalization Group (RG) analysis. Unfortunately, some of their RG analysis are incorrect as\ndemonstrated in Sec.IV.\nIt was shown in the text that our resulting general effective action Eq.19 at the two special statistical angles\n\u03b8 = \u00b11/2 is essentially equivalent to the dual vortex representation of Z2 gauge theory developed by SF, except\nit also bring out explicitly the Volovik effect which was\nmissed in SF's Z2 gauge theory.\nAs explicitly stressed in this paper, the U (1) mutual\nCS theory in the continuum does not have the required\nperiodicity under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 1. In order to preserve this periodicity when the mutual statistical angle takes special\nvalues \u03b8 = \u00b11/2, a Z2 mutual CS theory must be enforced on the lattice. Again, two ways of regularization\nmay lead to different conclusions. In fact, the periodicity\nof the conventional CS theory under \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + 2 is also\na very intricate issue. On the one hand, the perturbative RG expansion in terms of the statistical angle \u03b8 in\nthe continuum limit in Refs. [21\u201323] does not have this\nperiodicity. On the other hand, properly regularized on\nthe lattice, the CS theory does have this periodicity [28].\nThe two different regularization do lead to different conclusions on the Quantum Hall transitions. It also leads\nto notorious Hall conductivity difficulty at \u03bd = 1/2 [29].\nAlthough we are unable to solve the critical behaviors\nof this combined Z2 and U (1) gauge fields coupled to\nspinons and hc/2e vortices, we stressed the importance\nof putting the theory on the lattices to keep the periodicity of Z2 mutual CS term and shed considerable lights on\nthe physical picture and structure of the quantum transitions driven by hc/2e vortices. We suggest that it may\nbe possible to trace out the Z2 gauge fluctuation on the\nlattice first to get an effective action without the discrete\ngauge fields, then take continuum limit of it and perform\nRG calculation. Further work is needed to sort out all the\n\npossible phases and to understand the critical behaviors\nof the phase transitions between these phases.\nThis work was supported by NSF Grant No. PHY9907949, university of Houston and DMR-97-07701.

[6], Ye pointed out that the long range Logarithmic interaction between vortices suppress the superfluid velocity fluctuation, but does not affect the internal\ngauge field fluctuation. He concluded that the quasiparticle scattering from the random gauge field dominate over that from the superfluid velocity ( the Volovik\neffect). In this appendix, by using the formalism developed in the main text, we provide additional evidence for\nthis conclusion.\nFor random pinned vortices, the static vortices do not\nfeel the statistical gauge field a\u03a6\n\u03bc in Eq.19. This corresponds to a mass term for this gauge field. Adding the\nmass term to the equation and integrating out a\u03a6\n\u03bc , it gen\u03c8\nerates a Maxwell term for a\u03bc [30]:\n1 \u03c8 2\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03c8\n\u03bc )\u03c8a + (f\u03bc\u03bd )\n4\n1 2\nf\n\u2212 iAef\n+ |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc )\u03a6|2 + V (|\u03a6|) + f\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03bb (B1)\n4\n10\n\n\fL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8a + |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03c6\u03bc )\u03c6|2 + V (|\u03c6|)\n1 \u03c6 2 1 \u03c6\nf 2\n) + (a\u03bc \u2212 Aef\n+ (f\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc )t\n4\n2\n\nIn the above Eq. the averages over a\u03c8\n\u03bc , a\u03bc , \u03a6 should\nbe understood as quenched instead of annealed averages.\nAs discussed in the main text, the long-range logarithmic\ninteraction between vortices represented by the Maxwell\nterm suppress the fluctuation of the superfluid velocity.\nThe quasi-particle is moving in a long-range correlated\nrandom magnetic field and short-range correlated scaler\npotential, in consistent with the physical picture in Ref.\n[6].\n\nf\nSetting a\u03c6\u03bc = Aef\nup to irrelevant term leads to\n\u03bc\n\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8a + n0 \u03c6\u2020 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c6 + |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc )\u03c6|2 + V (|\u03c6|) + * * *\n(C5)\nwhere the second term is the Berry phase term and\n* * * means the irrelevant couplings between bosons and\nfermions. The above Eq. is essentially the same as\nEq.C1. Bosons and fermions are asymptotically decoupled. The fermions (spinons) carry only spin 1/2, the\nbosons ( holons) carry only charge e. There is spincharge separation. The long-range Coulomb interaction\ncould be incorporated by adding the dynamic term for\nthe time component of the gauge field 12 k|A0 (k)|2 [31].\nWithout the fermionic part, the action is the same as\nthe superconductor-insulator transitions in dirty metals\nstudied in [32], except here condensed is a charge e boson\ninstead of a Cooper pair.\nIn the underdoped regime, the vortex condenses <\n\u03a6 >= \u03a60 which generates a mass term for a\u03bc in Eq.C2\n1 2\n2\n2 \u03a60 (a\u03bc )t . Integrating out the massive a\u03bc leads to a\nf\nMaxwell term for Aef\n= A\u03bc \u2212 K \u22121 J\u03bc from which we\n\u03bc\ncan identify the automatically conserved electric current\nI\u03bc = \u03a612 (\u2202\u03bd2 J\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd J\u03bd ) [13].\n0\nIn the superconductor phase, the vortex \u03a6 is massive, therefore can be integrated out, it leads to the\nold Maxwell term 4m1 \u03a6 (f\u03bc\u03bd )2 . Integrating out a\u03bc genf 2\nerates a mass term 12 m\u03a6 (Aef\n\u03bc )t . From the mass term,\nwe can identify the automatically conserved electric current I\u03bc = m\u03a6 (J\u03bc )t . Note that although the quasi-particle\nelectric current is not conserved itself, the total electric\nq q\ncurrent I\u03bc = m\u03a6 (\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03bcq2 \u03bd )J\u03bd (q) is conserved.\n\nAPPENDIX C: HC/E VORTICES, SPIN-CHARGE\nSEPARATION AND MOTT INSULATOR\n\nIn sec III, neglecting the charge fluctuation, we concentrated on the effect of mutual C-S term. In this appendix, we do the opposite, namely neglecting the mutual C-S term, but concentrate on the effect of charge\nfluctuation. This is realized by using neutral-like transformation, namely setting \u03c6A = \u03c6B = \u03c6/2 which is\nsingle-valued in the resulting hc/e vortices. The double\nstrength vortex and its stability was investigated in Ref.\n[12], the associated spin-charge separation has been discussed extensively in Refs. [13,10]. In this appendix, to\ncontrast with hc/2e vortices discussed in the main text,\nwe review their results, fill in some details and also get\nthe new result on the expression of current operator I\u03bc\nin the superconducting phase.\nPutting \u03c6A = \u03c6B = \u03c6/2, namely setting a\u03bc = 0 in\nEq.11 leads to:\n\u2020\nL = \u03c81a\n[\u2202\u03c4 + vf px \u03c4 3 + v2 py \u03c4 1 ]\u03c81a + (1 \u2192 2, x \u2192 y)\nK\nf 2\n(C1)\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 Aef\n\u03bc )\n2\nf\nwhere the effective gauge field is Aef\n= A\u03bc \u2212 K \u22121 J\u03bc .\n\u03bc\nThere is no internal gauge field a\u03bc , because double vortices do not scatter the quasi-particles.\nPerforming duality transformation to vortex representation leads to\n\nL = \u03c8a\u2020 \u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8a + |(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc )\u03a6|2 + V (|\u03a6|)\n1 2\nf\n\u2212 iAef\n+ f\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u2202\u03bd a\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc\u01ebij \u2202i aj\n4\n\n[1] G.

The K matrix [26] contains a\nzero eigenvalue, it indicates a Goldstone mode which has\ndirect experimental consequences. See I. B. Spielman, et\nal, Phys. Rev. Lett, 84, 5808 (2000); cond-mat/0012094.\nIn Eq.22, the K matrix only has off-diagonal elements,\ntherefore invertible.\n[28] E. Fradkin and S. Kivelson, Nucl. Phys. B474, 543 (1996).\n[29] S.
