Sixteen optical spectra were obtained during\ndifferent runs, which constitute the first spectroscopic monitoring done in the\nrest-frame UV region (z=0.859). An overall flux variation of the MgII(\u03bb2800 \u00c5)\nby a factor \u223c 3 was observed, while the corresponding UV continuum (Fcont at\n\u03bb3000 \u00c5) changed by a factor \u223c 14. The MgII emission lines respond proportionally to the continuum variations when the source is in a low-activity state.\nIn contrast, near the optical outbursts detected in 2005 and 2007, the MgII\nemission lines showed little response to the continuum flux variations. During\nthe monitored period the UV FeII flux changed by a factor \u223c 6 and correlated\nwith Fcont (r = 0.92). A negative correlation between EW(Mg II) and Fcont was\nfound, i.e. the so-called \"Intrinsic Baldwin Effect\".\n\n1.\n\nResults\n\nIn order to model the Mg II emission resonance doublet at \u03bb\u03bb \u223c2795,2803\n(hereafter Mg II), we fitted a power law to the continuum emission. In addition,\nthe UV Fe II template of Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001) was used for modeling\nand subtracting the Fe II contribution in all calibrated and de-reddened spectra.\nThe Mg II emission line fluxes were obtained after fitting Gaussian profiles. In\nFigure 1 (left side) we present a plot showing the variation of the FMgII vs.\nFcont . When excluding the points near the 2005 and 2007 outbursts, a linear\nfit was obtained: FMgII = (3.08 \u00b1 0.67) + (6.69 \u00b1 1.05) Fcont , with a correlation\ncoefficient r = 0.89. Including our 2005 and 2007 data, a completely different\ntendency is observed. On September 3, 2007 (UT) the Mg II flux is found to be a\nfactor \u223c 1.3 smaller with respect to the above linear correlation. This tendency\nis even stronger on May 13, 2005 (UT), where the Mg II flux is a found to be a\nfactor \u223c 2.3 smaller. A similar behavior between FMgII vs. Fcont was found in\nAO 0235+16 (Raiteri et al. 2007a).\n\n1\n\nInstituto de Astronom\u0131\u0301a, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Apdo.

Left: Mg II variability behavior during the monitoring period.\nThe solid line represents our linear fit obtained during low-activity states;\nthe broken line shows the deviation from the fit obtained when adding data\nnear the 2005 and 2007 outbursts. Right: The solid line shows the correlation\nfound between the Fe II and the UV Fcont fluxes.\n\nUsing all spectra we also studied the variability behavior of the UV Fe II\nwith respect to the continuum changes. We found a linear correlation (see Figure\n1, right side): FFeII = (5.12 \u00b1 2.28) + (23.28 \u00b1 3.49) Fcont , with r = 0.89. One of\nthe main results of this study is that the Fe II flux tends to follow the continuum\nvariations. Although the origin of the UV Fe II lines in AGN is not completely\nclarified (Joly et al. 2008), it seems possible that part of this emission originates\nfrom a region that is close to the base of the relativistic jet, while the Mg II may\nbe emitted in a more extended region (Goad et al. 1999) and cannot respond\nimmediately to dramatic flux variations. Another possible scenario may be that\nthe relativistic jet continuum swamps almost all the thermal contribution from\nthe Big Blue Bump (see Raiteri et al. 2007b) and also from the BLR. Finally,\nan anticorrelation between EW (Mg II) and Fcont was found using all spectra:\n\u22120.53\u00b10.07\nEW (Mg II)= 8.43Fcont\n, known as \"Intrinsic Baldwin Effect\" (see Osmer\n& Shields 1999).\nAcknowledgments.
