A counting rate of regenerated\nphotons compatible with zero has been measured. The corresponding limits on the pseudoscalar\naxionlike particle-two photon coupling constant is obtained as a function of the particle mass. Our\nsetup widens the energy window of purely terrestrial experiments devoted to the axionlike particle\nsearch by coupling to two photons. It also opens a new domain of experimental investigation of\nphoton propagation in magnetic fields.\nPACS numbers:\n\nPhoton propagation in magnetic fields is a long standing domain of research for QED tests [1] and for particle\nsearches beyond the standard model [2]. All the experiments performed up to now have used a photon energy\nof the order of 1 eV (see [3] and Refs. therein). Higher\nphoton energies have been proposed to increase the signal, in particular \u03b3 rays [4] for QED test, or to increase\nthe parameter space for particle searches, in particular\nx-rays [5, 6].\nAs far as particle searches are concerned, photon regeneration experiments [7\u20139], also called \"light shining\nthrough the wall\" experiments, are an important tool in\nthe search for massive particles that couple to photons\nin the presence of magnetic fields. Such particles are\npredicted by many extensions of the standard model. A\nvery well known example is the standard axion, a pseudoscalar chargeless boson proposed to solve the strong\nCP problem [10\u201312] i.e. the difference between the value\nof the neutron electric dipole moment predicted by QCD\nand its experimental value [13].\nThe principle of a photon regeneration experiment is to\nsend a polarized photon beam through a region where a\ntransverse magnetic field is present, and then to stop the\nphotons by a wall. Since they hardly interact with matter, axionlike particles (ALPs) generated in the magnetic\nregion upstream of the wall can pass through it. Behind\nthe wall, a second magnetic field region allows to convert\nback ALPs into photons. Several photon regeneration\nexperiments have been performed [14\u201320]: none of them\nhas ever detected regenerated photons. They have therefore set limits on the ALP-two photon coupling constant\ng and the particle mass ma . The best limits can be found\nin Ref. [20].\nLimits are usually given for masses ma \u226a \u03c9 [21], where\n\u03c9 is the photon energy, but a detailed theoretical analysis\nof ALP-photon and photon-ALP conversion amplitudes\nvalid for ma \u2264 \u03c9 can be found in Ref. [22]. Again, for\nall the photon regeneration experiments performed up to\n\nnow, \u03c9 is of the order of 1 eV. Experiments searching\nfor ALPs of astrophysical origin, such as ADMX [23] and\nCAST [24], provide better limits than the purely terrestrial ones. ADMX looks for galactic cold dark matter\n\u03bceV ALP conversion into microwave photons in a resonant cavity immersed in a static magnetic field, while\nCAST looks for axions or ALPs generated in the core of\nthe sun. These ALPs travel to earth and are converted\nback into photons of a few keV in a static laboratory magnetic field. Due to the higher photon energy, the CAST\nlimits extend up to masses on the order of a few eV [24].\nThese limits, however, depend on the model used to calculate the flux of ALPs to be detected. The critical sensitivity to these models is exposed by the recent proposal\nof an ALP with a 17 meV mass which could explain the\nobserved spectral shape of the x-ray solar emission [25].\nIn this case ALPs coming from the sun's interior would\nbe reconverted into photons near the sun's surface, thus\nescaping the detection by CAST.\nIncreasing the photon energy in photon regeneration\nexperiments allows to test new regions of the ma and\ng parameter space. The use of soft x-rays has been\nproposed in Ref. [5], namely at the VUV-FEL free electron laser at DESY, providing photons of energy between 10 eV and 200 eV. The use of hard x-rays from\na synchrotron light source has been proposed in Ref. [6].\nSynchrotron light sources provide photons with energy of\nseveral tens of keV, much higher than the photon energy\navailable nowadays at free electron lasers.\nIn this letter we describe our photon regeneration experiment using x-ray beams with a photon energy of\n50.2 keV and 90.7 keV, carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), France, on beamline\nID06 [26]. Our setup consists of two superconducting\nmagnets that provide magnetic fields of 3 T over a length\nof 150 and 97 mm respectively, and a Ge detector with a\nhigh quantum efficiency for the stated photon energies.\nThis configuration widens the energy domain probed by\n\n\f2\nOptics Hutch\n\nKr\nionization\nchamber\n\nE\n\nUndulator\nu18u/u32\nX-ray beam\n\nExp.

The double crystal monochromator is adjusted to select the desired photon energy. The\nfirst experimental hutch corresponds to the ALP generation\narea with the transverse magnetic field B1 . The second experimental hutch contains the second magnetic field B2 which\nallows to reconvert ALPs to photons. These photons are detected by a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge detector with a high\nquantum efficiency. Ionization chambers placed along the\nbeam path measure the incident flux or serve for alignement\npurposes. The synchrotron x-rays are polarized parallel to\nthe magnetic fields.\n\npurely terrestrial ALP searches. A counting rate of regenerated photons compatible with zero has been measured.\nWe present the corresponding limits on the ALP-two photon coupling constant as a function of the particle mass.\nThanks to the high photon energy, our limits extend to\na parameter region where no model independent limits\nhave been set so far. In particular our experimental results provide limits on the existence of 17 meV ALPs.\nOur experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. We use two\ndifferent photon energies, \u03c9 = 50.2 keV and 90.7 keV,\ncorresponding to slightly different settings of the x-ray\nbeamline. For 50.2 keV (resp. 90.7 keV), a Si(111) (resp.\nSi(311)) double crystal monochromator is adjusted to select x-rays emitted by the 5th (resp. 9th ) harmonic of the\ncryogenic permanent magnet multipole undulator source\nU18, closed to a gap of 6.0 mm [27, 28]. The energy\nbandwidth is 7.3 eV (resp. 6.8 eV). For both energies,\nthe size of the beam is 2 \u00d7 2 mm2 and the synchrotron\nx-rays are horizontally polarized. The beam direction is\nstabilized by a feedback loop adjusting the pitch of the\nsecond monochromator crystal to ensure a position stability better than 0.1 mm at the entrance of the second\nmagnet.\nMost of the beam path is under vacuum in order to\navoid air absorption. The incident flux is measured\nthanks to ionization chambers filled with 1 bar of nitrogen\nor krypton. Different ionization chambers placed along\nthe beam path let us check for any photon loss due to\nbeam misalignment for example. During data acquisition, the 30 cm long krypton filled ionization chamber,\nlocated just before the first magnet, is used to precisely\nmonitor the incident flux. The beamline has delivered\nabout 1.2 \u00d7 1012 photons per second at 50.2 keV and\n3.1 \u00d7 1010 photons per second at 90.7 keV.\nThe magnetic fields are provided by two superconducting magnets with the field direction parallel to the xray polarization, the experiment being thus sensitive to\n\npseudoscalar particles [29]. Their diameter aperture is\nabout 2 cm and the pressure inside the magnets is less\nthan 10\u22124 mbar. Both magnets have been manufactured\nby Oxford Instruments. The first one has provided a\nmaximum magnetic field B1 = 3 T which can be regarded as uniform along the beam path over a length\nof L1 = 150 mm. The second magnet was lent to us by\nthe DUBBLE beamline (BM26) [30] at the ESRF. It has\nalso delivered B2 = 3 T. The shape of its magnetic field\nalong the beam direction can be approximated by a triangular shape with a half base length of L2 = 97 mm,\nthe maximum of 3 T being at the center of the magnet.\nThe magnets are located separately in the two lead\nshielded experimental hutches, EH1 and EH2 respectively, of the beamline. The safety shutter between EH1\nand EH2 serves as the wall to block the x-ray beam. It\nconsists of a 50 mm thick lead plate. Similarly, the xray regeneration and detection section is shielded by the\nradiation hutch EH2. The complete enclosure of the primary x-ray beam in EH1 and the additional shielding of\nEH2 lead to a comfortably low level of x-ray background\nradiation dominated by cosmic events.\nThe detection system is based on a 5 mm thick Ge detector (Canberra GL0055) cooled with liquid nitrogen.\nThe sensitive area is 6 mm in diameter. X-ray photons\narriving on the detector create electric charges proportional to the photon energy, which are amplified (Canberra 2024) and filtered by a single channel analyzer\n(Ortec 850) to reject events that do not correspond to\nthe photon energy selected by the monochromator. This\ndetection system combines an acceptable quantum efficiency of \u2248 99.98% at 50.2 keV and \u2248 84% at 90.7 keV,\nwith a reasonably low dark count rate. This background\ncount rate was measured at (7.2\u00b11.4)\u00d710\u22123 photons per\nsecond while the x-ray beam was turned off, as shown on\nthe first line of Table I. The error corresponds to 95 %\nconfidence level.\nThe following experimental protocol is used before\neach data acquisition. First, the monochromator is adjusted to select the desired energy while keeping an incident flux as high as possible. Then, the detector is\nmoved about 20 cm sideways from the direct beam position. The safety shutter is opened, allowing the x-ray\nbeam to propagate through both experimental hutches.\nIn this position, the dominant radiation received at the\ndetector are photons elastically scattered by air [31]. This\nis used to adjust the upper and lower thresholds of the\nsingle channel analyzer such that only photons of the selected energy are counted. The upper (lower) threshold\nis 10 % above (20 % below) the voltage generated by the\nelastically scattered photons. Next, the detector is protected by Cu absorbers and it is moved back into the\ndirect beam position to check its geometrical alignment.\nFinally, before data collection the safety shutter is closed\nand the Cu absorbers are removed. The procedure is\nrepeated after data collection.\n\n\f3\nX-ray beam\n\nMagnets\n\nOFF\nON\nON\nON\nON\n\nOFF\nOFF\nON\nOFF\nON\n\n\u03c9 (keV)\n\nti (s)\n\nNinc (Hz)\n\n50.2\n50.2\n90.7\n90.7\n\n13913\n7575\n7276\n7444\n7247\n\n0\n1.2 \u00d7 1012\n1.2 \u00d7 1012\n3.2 \u00d7 1010\n3.1 \u00d7 1010\n\nNc (Hz)\n(7.2 \u00b1 1.4)\n(5.7 \u00b1 1.8)\n(6.2 \u00b1 1.8)\n(7.9 \u00b1 2.0)\n(8.1 \u00b1 2.2)\n\nNp (Hz)\n\u22123\n\n\u00d710\n\u00d710\u22123\n\u00d710\u22123\n\u00d710\u22123\n\u00d710\u22123\n\n(0.5 \u00b1 2.6) \u00d7 10\u22123\n(0.2 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10\u22123\n\nTABLE I: Summary of our data acquisition taken with magnets on or off, x-ray beam on or off.

These equations are correct\nfor ma \u226a \u03c9.\nOur experimental sensitivity limit for the ALP-two\nphoton coupling constant versus mass is calculated by numerically solving Eqs. (1) and (2), using the upper photon\nregeneration probability experimentally measured. To\nthis end, the real profiles of the magnetic fields along the\nbeam direction provided by the manufacturers are used.\nOur limits at 95 % confidence level are plotted in Fig. 2.\nIn particular, g < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 GeV\u22121 for masses lower\nthan 0.4 eV, and g < 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 GeV\u22121 for masses lower\nthan 1 eV. Our limits could be extended up to 90 keV\n[22], but because of the phase\np mismatching they decrease\nvery rapidly when ma \u226b \u03c9/L1,2, thus becoming less\ninteresting. Moreover, for such masses the probability\n\n4\n2\n\nVeG( g\n\n2\n\nz\n\n1\n\n1-\n\np (z) =\n\nZ\n\noscillates so rapidly that its actual value depends critically on the exact value of the experimental parameters\nL1,2 and \u03c9. In this case the level of confidence of corresponding limits is mostly limited by the confidence level\non these experimental values. We believe that a detailed\ndiscussion of this issue is out of the scope of our letter.\n\n)\n\nResults are summarized in Table I. The integration\ntime ti is about 2 hours for each photon energy in two\ndifferent configurations \u2013 with or without the magnetic\nfields. The count rate Nc is the number of photons detected per second. The error on p\nNc corresponds to 95 %\nconfidence level and is given by 2 Nc /ti since the distribution of the detected photons is a Poisson distribution.\nThe number of regenerated photons per second Np is the\ndifference between count rates measured with and without the magnetic fields. We see that no excess count\nabove the background level has been detected. Finally\nthe upper photoregeneration probability at 95 % confidence level corresponds to the error on Np over the incident photon rate Ninc . It is P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 at 50.2 keV,\nand P = 9.7 \u00d7 10\u221214 at 90.7 keV.\nThe photon to ALP conversion and reconversion transition probability after propagating in vacuum over a distance z in an inhomogeneous magnetic field B may be\nwritten as [32]:\n\n0.1\n4\n2\n\n0.01\n4\n2\n\n0.001\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n0.1\n\n8\n\n9\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\nma (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: 95 % confidence level limits on the ALP-two photon\ncoupling constant g as a function of the particle mass ma .\nThe grey area is excluded. The dashed line represents limits\nobtained with a photon energy of 50.2 keV while the solid line\ncorresponds to 90.7 keV.\n\nWe compare our limits to other limits obtained with\nlaboratory experiments in Fig.3. Our exclusion region is\npresented as the grey area. The best limits obtained on\na purely laboratory experiment by the ALPS collaboration [20] with a 95 % confidence level is the region above\nthe solid line. The best limits set by the search of extraterrestrial ALPs are the two hashed areas, namely the\n95 % confidence level exclusion region of CAST (diagonally hashed) [24], and the 90 % confidence level exclusion region on microwave cavity experiments (horizontally hashed) [23, 33\u201335]. Model predictions [36] are also\nshown as a dotted stripe (line in between: E/N = 0\n[37, 38]). This figure shows that we have tested a new\nregion of the ma and g parameter space for purely terrestrial \u2013 model independent \u2013 experiments.\nOur experiment could certainly be upgraded. A longer\nacquisition time would improve the limits, but an improvement of a factor of 2 requires a 16 times longer\nacquisition. This also applies for the photon flux and for\n\n\f4\nfully acknowledge the support of the Fondation pour la\nrecherche IXCORE.\n\n1\n\n10\n-1\n\n10\n-3\n\n10\n-5\n\n10\n)\nVeG( g\n\n1-\n\n-7\n\n10\n-9\n\n10\n-11\n\n10\n-13\n\n10\n-15\n\n10\n-17\n\n10\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nma (eV)\nOur experiment\nALPS\n\nMicrowave cavity\nCAST\nAxion models\n\nFIG. 3: Limits on the ALP-two photon coupling constant g as\na function of the particle mass ma obtained by experimental\nsearches.

The latter could likely be improved\nby using the x-ray detector in anticoincidence with cosmic ray detectors put around it and/or in coincidence\nwith the electron bunches circulating in the synchrotron\nring. Using higher magnetic fields increases limits linearly, which is obviously more interesting. A static 15 T\nfield can be reasonably envisaged. Longer magnets could\nprovide higher limits but only at low masses since longer\nmagnets reduce the coherence length of the photon-ALP\noscillations and limits at higher masses. The best solution would be to increase the magnetic field B and reduce\nthe magnet length L keeping the product B \u00d7 L as high\nas possible.\nOur experiment extends the search of photon oscillations into massive particles in the presence of magnetic\nfields to higher energies. The observed low background\ncount rate clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of \"shining through the wall\" experiments with a synchrotron\nlight source. Moreover we studied for the first time the\npropagation of x-ray photons in magnetic fields opening\na new domain of experimental investigations.\nThis work has been performed in the framework of\nthe BMV project.
