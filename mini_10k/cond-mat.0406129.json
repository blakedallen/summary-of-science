Ketterle\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0406129v1 [cond-mat.soft] 4 Jun 2004\n\nDepartment of Physics, MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms, and Research Laboratory of Electronics,\nMIT, Cambridge, MA 02139\n(Dated: June 25, 2018)\nWe have observed three Feshbach resonances in collisions between 6 Li and 23 Na atoms. The resonances were identified as narrow loss features when the magnetic field was varied. The molecular\nstates causing these resonances have been identified, and additional 6 Li-23 Na resonances are predicted. These resonances will allow the study of degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures with adjustable\ninteractions, and could be used to generate ultracold heteronuclear molecules.\nPACS numbers: 32.80.Pj,34.50.-s,67.60.-g\n\nFeshbach resonances [1, 2, 3, 4] have made it possible to control interactions in ultracold atomic gases.\nBy tuning the magnetic field near a value where the\nenergy of two free atoms coincides with a molecular\nbound state, the sign and strength of the atomic interactions can be varied. Such tunable interactions were used\nto Bose-Einstein condense atomic species with unfavorable collisional properties [5, 6, 7], for cooling fermionic\nmixtures to degeneracy [8], and to produce bright solitons [6, 9]. Measurements of Feshbach resonances led\nto precise determinations of interatomic potentials [10].\nAn important recent application of Feshbach resonances\nwas the production of ultracold molecules from ultracold\natoms [11], and Bose-Einstein condensation of molecules\n[12, 13, 14, 15].\nSo far, all experiments on Feshbach resonances studied collisions between two atoms of the same species. A\nfew theoretical papers predicted Feshbach resonances between different atomic species [16, 17], but these have not\nbeen observed. Interspecies Feshbach resonances should\nlead to a host of new scientific phenomena, including\nthe study of ultracold Fermi-Bose mixtures with tunable interactions, for which boson-mediated Cooper pairing [18, 19], phase separation [20] and supersolid order\n[21] have been predicted. These resonances may also be\nused to produce polar molecules, at phase-space densities\nhigher than those obtained by heteronuclear photoassociation [22, 23, 24, 25]. Ultracold polar molecules could\nbe used for quantum computation [26] for studies of correlated many-body systems [27, 28], and for searches for\nan electronic dipole moment [29].\nIn this work, we studied collisions between fermionic\n6\nLi and bosonic 23 Na. In the absence of any theoretical\nprediction, it was not clear if there were any resonances\nin the accessible range of magnetic fields. Three s-wave\nFeshbach resonances were observed and assigned.\nAn ultracold mixture of 6 Li in the |F, mF i = |3/2, 3/2i\nand 23 Na in the |F, mF i = |2, 2i hyperfine states was\nproduced by forced microwave evaporation of 23 Na in a\nmagnetic trap as previously described in [30]. The evaporation was stopped before reaching quantum degeneracy,\nand the mixture was transferred into a single focus 1064\n\nnm optical dipole trap with a waist of 25 \u03bcm and a maximum power of 9 W. The 6 Li and 23 Na atoms were then\ntransferred to the |1/2, 1/2i and |1, 1i hyperfine states,\nrespectively, by simultaneous RF Landau-Zener sweeps.\nThe sweeps were done by ramping the magnetic field from\n9 to 10 G in 10 ms while keeping the RF frequencies constant at 249.8 MHz for 6 Li and 1790 MHz for 23 Na yielding a transfer efficiency close to 100 %. This mixture of\natoms in their lower hyperfine states was further cooled\nto quantum degeneracy by ramping down the laser power\nof the optical trap from 9 W to 220 mW in 1.4s.\nAtom numbers were determined from absorption images of the atom clouds. For imaging, a second LandauZener sweep was used to transfer lithium and sodium\nback into their upper hyperfine states, where both species\ncould be probed using cycling transitions. Lithium and\nsodium were imaged at the end of the experiment by taking first a lithium and then a sodium absorption image\nin rapid succession. Typically, mixtures of 2 \u00d7 106 degenerate fermions at T /TF \u2248 0.25 with a condensed 23 Na\ncloud of 2 \u00d7 106 atoms were produced at a temperature\nof 900 nK. The peak densities were 1 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123 for 6 Li\nand 2 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22123 for 23 Na. The lifetime of the mixture\nwas longer than 10 s.\nWe searched for Feshbach resonances up to the maximum magnetic field available experimentally, 1025 G,\nby sweeping the magnetic field across 20 G intervals at\na rate of 21 G/s and determining the number of atoms\nleft. The intervals containing resonances were identified\nby a higher loss rate. Precise measurements of the resonance positions were done by starting at a field near the\nresonance, and varying the endpoint of a constant rate\nsweep towards or across the resonance. The resonances\nwere located by a sudden drop in the atom number, as\nseen in Fig. 1 for the resonance at 746 G. The magnetic\nfield was calibrated by driving, at the resonance fields,\nRF transitions between the |2i and |3i, or between the\n|2i and |5i, high field hyperfine states of 6 Li.\nIn the same magnetic field range, we have observed one\n6\nLi and six 23 Na single species Feshbach resonances which\nhave not been observed before [31]. Interspecies 6 Li-23 Na\nresonances were identified after checking that for a pure\n\n\f2\n\nAtom Number\n\n3x10\n\n6\n\nSodium\nLithium\n\n2\n\n1\n\na\n\n0\n740\n\nb\n\nc\n\n745\nMagnetic Field [G]\nb\n\na\n\nLi\n\nTABLE I: Location of 6 Li-23 Na Feshbach resonances and\nthe assignment of the molecular states which cause the resonances.

The magnetic field was swept down at a\nrate of 5.7 G/s from a field above the resonance to a variable final field. As the resonance was crossed, a sharp loss\nin atom number was observed. Top: 6 Li (circles) and 23 Na\n(open squares) atom numbers vs. the final field. The solid line\n(6 Li) and the dashed line (23 Na) are tangent hyperbolic fits\nto the data. Both fits locate the resonance at 746.0\u00b10.4 G. A\nwidth of 0.8 G was obtained, which reflects both the intrinsic width of the resonances and the magnetic field stability.\nBottom: The absorption images show the lithium cloud on\nthe left side and the sodium cloud on the right. They were\ntaken at the three magnetic fields labeled a, b, c. No losses\nwere observed for lithium only (upper row) and sodium only\n(middle row), whereas the mixture (bottom row) showed the\nonset of losses of both species at the resonance. The sodium\nimages clearly show the bimodal distribution characteristic\nfor a Bose condensate. The field of view of each absorption\nimage was 6 mm x 3 mm.\n\nsample of either lithium or sodium, no resonant losses\noccurred at the same field. Three 6 Li-23 Na resonances\nwere observed, as listed in Table I.\nThe losses are either due to (inelastic) three-body recombination, or due to resonant molecule formation during the sweep. Other two-body loss mechanisms are not\npossible for 6 Li and 23 Na both in their lowest energy\nhyperfine state. It should be noted that in the mixture near single species sodium Feshbach resonances, enhanced losses were also observed for lithium, presumably\n\nMagnetic Field\n(G)\n\nRamp Speed\n(G/s)\n\nMolecular State\n|S MS mi,Li mi,Na i\n\n746.0 \u00b1 0.4\n759.6 \u00b1 0.2\n795.6 \u00b1 0.2\n\n15\n0.3\n10\n\n|1 1 \u2212 1 3/2i\n|1 1 0 1/2i\n|1 1 1 \u2212 1/2i\n\nin a three-body process involving a sodium dimer and a\nlithium atom. Also, sodium losses were observed near\nthe single species lithium resonance.\nWe assign the molecular states causing these resonances by extending the approach presented in [32] to the\ncase of two distinguishable atoms. Without the knowledge of the exact interatomic potentials the energies of\nthe weakest bound molecular states cannot be predicted.\nHowever, one can still approximate the molecular hyperfine structure and Zeeman shifts and predict a pattern\nof Feshbach resonances with the molecular binding energy at zero magnetic field as the only adjustable parameter. We have checked that this procedure, applied\nto 23 Na, reproduces all Feshbach resonances measured\nexperimentally or predicted by coupled channels calculations to within 5%.\nThe Coulomb interaction between two atoms naturally\n~ = ~s1 +~s2 . If we nepreserves their total electronic spin S\nglect the hyperfine interaction, S is thus a good quantum\nnumber and the bound states are either singlet (S = 0)\nor triplet (S = 1). The molecular hyperfine energy at\nzero field is approximated as the sum of the hyperfine\ninteraction for the two atoms:\nHhf = haLi\ns1 * ~iLi + haNa\ns2 * ~iNa ,\nhf ~\nhf ~\nwith ~s1,2 the spins of the two valence electrons, ~iLi (Na)\nthe nuclear spin of the 6 Li (23 Na) nucleus (iLi = 1, iNa =\n3/2), and the hyperfine constants aLi\nhf = 152.1368(1)MHz,\naNa\n=\n885.8131(1)MHz\n[33].\nWe\nrewrite\nHhf in terms of\nhf\n~\nS:\nhaNa ~ ~\nhaLi\nhf ~ ~\nS * iLi + hf S\n* iNa\n2\n2\nhaLi\nhaNa\n+ hf (~s1 \u2212 ~s2 ) * ~iLi + hf (~s1 \u2212 ~s2 ) * ~iNa\n2\n2\n= Vhf+ + Vhf\u2212 ,\n\nHhf =\n\n~ and thus\nHere, Vhf+ contains the terms proportional to S,\npreserves the separation of the orbital from the spin prob-\n\n\f3\n|1,-1>\n\n|S MS mi,Li mi,Na>\n2000\n\n1500\n\nNa\n\n+ |1/2,-1/2>\n\n|1,1>\n\nLi\n\nNa\n\n+ |1/2,1/2>\n\nLi\n\nMagnetic Field [G]\n1000\n\n500\n\n500\n\n0\n\n-4000\n\n|1 0 1 1/2>\n\n-12000\n\nEnergy /\n\nh\n\n-8000\n\n[MHz]\n\n|1 0 -1 -1/2>\n|1 -1 1 1/2>\n|1 -1 0 -1/2>\n|1 -1 1 -3/2>\n\n|S MS mi,Li mi,Na>\n\n1500\n\n|1 1 -1 3/2>\n|1 1 0 1/2>\n|1 1 1 -1/2>\n\n|1 1 -1 -3/2>\n\n|1 0 0 -3/2>\n\n1000\n\n|1 0 0 3/2>\n\n|1 -1 1 3/2>\n\nFIG. 2: Feshbach resonances in collisions between 6 Li in |1/2, \u00b11/2i and 23 Na in |1, \u00b11i hyperfine states. The solid lines show\nthe energy dependence of triplet hyperfine molecular states for which coupling to the open channel is allowed by conservation of\nthe total MF . The dashed line shows the open channel energy threshold, equal to the sum of hyperfine energies of the incoming\nparticle. The three observed Feshbach resonances occur in the |1/2, 1/2iLi + |1, 1iNa collision channel, at the crossing of the\nthreshold with three molecular states between 700 G and 850 G. For this channel, two other resonances should occur near 1700\nG. In the |1/2, \u22121/2iLi + |1, \u22121iNa collision channel, one resonance can be predicted to occur near 1100 G and another two\nnear 2000 G.\n\nlem. Vhf\u2212 , however, mixes singlet and triplet states. Following [32], we will assume that the singlet-triplet spacLi\ning is large compared to aNa\nhf and ahf , so that we can ne\u2212\nglect Vhf . In this approach, the orbital (Coulomb) part\nof the interaction remains decoupled from the spin part,\nwhich alone is responsible for the magnetic field dependence of the states.\nFor non-zero magnetic field, the spin part of the molecular hyperfine states is described by the Hamiltonian\n+\nHint\n= Vhf+ + VZeeman\n\nwith\n~ + gLi ~iLi + gNa ~iNa ),\n~ * (gS S\nVZeeman = \u03bcB B\nwhere gS , gLi and gNa are the g-factors of the electron, of\nthe 6 Li, and of the 23 Na nucleus. For collisions between\n|1, 1iNa + |1/2, 1/2iLi the total MF = 23 . In s-wave scattering, this incoming (open) channel can only be coupled\nto molecular states with the same MF . In total, one can\ncount two singlet and six triplet spin states with MF = 32 .\nFeshbach resonances occur at the magnetic fields at\nwhich a molecular hyperfine state has the same orbital\nplus hyperfine energy as the colliding atoms. The two\nalmost degenerate singlet spin states cannot explain the\nexistence of three well-separated resonances. Thus, the\nobserved resonances can be assigned to three triplet spin\nstates with MS = 1, differing only in their nuclear\nmagnetic quantum numbers, as shown in Fig. 2. Using the orbital energy EB as a free parameter, we performed a least-squares fit of the level crossings of these\n\nstates with the atomic threshold, to the three experimentally obtained resonance positions. This resulted in\nEB = \u22125550 \u00b1 140 MHz, which represents an estimate of\nthe energy of a weakly bound triplet state of the 6 Li-23 Na\ninteratomic potential. The error was estimated by finding the values of EB which fit either the lowest (746G)\nor the highest (796G) resonance. The resulting resonant\nmagnetic fields are 717 G, 763 G and 821 G. In view of the\nsimplicity of the approach, the agreement with the observed resonance positions is satisfactory. Inverting the\nsign of the magnetic field, we obtain the level diagram\nfor collisions of |1, \u22121iNa + |1/2, \u22121/2iLi (Fig. 2) which\npredicts several additional resonances.\nThe observed Feshbach resonances may be used to produce 6 Li23 Na molecules by sweeping the magnetic field\nacross the resonance. Atom pairs are converted into\nmolecules by passing adiabatically through the LandauZener avoided crossing [11, 34]. The efficiency of this conversion depends on the lifetime of the molecular cloud. In\nexperiments with bosons, due to rapid vibrational relaxation, short molecular lifetimes on the order of a few ms\nhave been observed. However, conversion efficiencies of a\nfew % could still be obtained [35]. The lifetime could be\nsubstantially increased by removing the leftover unbound\natoms with a short light pulse [36].\nFermionic atoms offer the advantage of long molecular lifetimes due to Pauli suppression [37, 38, 39]. In\nthe case of 6 Li2 and 40 K2 , highly vibrationally excited\nmolecules were stable close to the resonance, where the\nmolecules have a dominant atomic character [40]. Fur-\n\n\f4\nther away from the resonance, as the molecules become\nmore strongly bound, the fermionic statistics of the constituents is no longer dominant, and loss rates increase\n[37, 38].\nWe expect the opposite behavior for fermionic\nmolecules produced near interspecies Feshbach resonances between a bosonic and fermionic atom. Far away\nfrom the resonance, all collisions between the molecules\nshould be Pauli suppressed. Near the resonance, the\ncollisions of long-range molecules are better approximated as collisions of their fermionic and bosonic atoms,\nand no significant suppression of collisions is expected.\nTherefore, a long-lived cloud of heteronuclear fermionic\nmolecules could be realized by sweeping the magnetic\nfield across and beyond the Feshbach resonance, and removing unbound atoms of both species with resonant\nlight pulses.\nIn conclusion, we have observed three 6 Li-23 Na Feshbach resonances and assigned them to weakly bound\nmolecular states using a simple model. These resonances\ncould be used for efficient production of ultracold heteronuclear molecules.\nAfter this work was completed, the observation of\nFeshbach resonances in collisions between rubidium and\npotassium atoms was reported [41].\nThis work was supported by the NSF, ONR, ARO, and\nNASA.
