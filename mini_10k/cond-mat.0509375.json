The binding energy of a shallow hydrogenic impurity in a quantum\nwell wire has been calculated as a function of the wire radius [5]. It has been\nfound that the binding energy increases with decreasing the wire radius for\nan infinite well whereas it reaches a peak value and then diminishes to a limiting value for a finite potential. The effect of location [6,7] of impurities has\nbeen studied as well as the different shapes of the cross-section [6,7] of the\nwire. Chen et al [11] have studied the effect of electron-phonon interaction\non the impurity binding energy in a quantum wire .\nIn this work, the effect of temperature on the binding energy of a donor impurity confined in a QWW is investigated theoretically using a variational\nmethod .\n\n\f2\n\nTheory\n\nThe Hamiltonian for an on-axis hydrogenic impurity in a cylindrical infinite\nQWW of radius R is given by\nH=\n\n\u2212~2 \u22072\ne2\np\n\u2212\n+ Vb (T ),\n2m1,2 (T ) \u01eb1,2 (T ) \u03c12 + z 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m1,2 (T ) and \u01eb1,2 (T ) are the temperature dependent effective-mass and\ndielectric constant of the QWW respectively. The two subscripts 1, 2 stand\nfor the potential well (GaAs) and the potential barrier (Alx Ga1\u2212x As) materials respectively. The values of m1,2 (T ) and \u01eb1,2 (T ) are taken as given in\nRefs.[12] and [13]. The potential barrier height Vb (T ) is obtained from the\ntemperature dependent band-gap discontinuity \u2206Eg (x, T ) given in eV as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1\u2264R\n\uf8f20,\nVb (T ) =\n(2)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0.60\u2206Eg (x, T ), \u03c1 > R,\n\nwhere\n\n\u2206Eg (x, T ) = x[1.247 \u2212 (1.15 \u00d7 10\u22124 )T ]; x < 0.45.\n\n(3)\n\nThe aim is to find the binding energy of the impurity using variational\nmethod\n\n2.1\n\nElectron Eigenstates\n\nConsidering the absence of impurity and imposing the boundaray condition ;\nContinuity of the wavefunction and its first derivative at The QWW radius;\nthe ground state wavefunction is found to be [5]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1\u2264R\n\uf8f2NJ0 (r10 \u03c1),\n(4)\n\u03a8(\u03c1) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nK0 (b10 \u03c1)\nNJ0 (r10 R) K0 (b10 R) , \u03c1 > R\n\nwhere N is the normalization constant, and\nr\n2m1 E100\nr10 =\n,\n~2\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fand\n\nJ1 (r10 R)K0 (r10 R)\n,\nJ0 (r10 R)K1 (r10 R)\n\n(6)\n\n~2 2\n~2 2\nr10 = Vb (T ) \u2212\nb .\n2m1\n2m2 10\n\n(7)\n\nb10 = r10\nand the eigenenergy is\nE100 =\n\nThe continuity of the derivative of the wave function wavefunction \u03c8(\u03c1) at\n\u03c1 = R gives the equation\nr10 (\n\nm2 (T )\nJ0 (r10 R)\n)J1 (r10 R) = b10\nK1 (b10 R),\nm1 (T )\nK0 (b10 R)\n\n(8)\n\nusing Equation(7),and putting the length in the bohr radius units (aB =\n2\n\u01eb0 ~2\n)and the energy in the Rydberg units (Rb = 2\u01ebe0 aB ),where me is the\nme e2\nelectron effective mass in room temperature.\nWe get\ns\nJ0 (r10 R)K1 (b10 R)\nr 2 m1 (T )\nm21 (T )\nr10 =\n\u2212 10\n(9)\nVb (T )\nJ1 (r10 R)K0 (b10 R)\nm2 (T )me\nm2 (T )\nthe first root of this equation for a certain temperature and wire radius gives\nthe value of r10 , and hence the energy eigenvalue E100\n\n2.2\n\nImpurity Eigenstates\n\nNow we consider an on-axis hydrogenic impurity, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nis no longer separable and the trail wave function is taken as\n\uf8f1\np\n\uf8f4\nNJ\n(r\n\u03c1)exp(\u2212\u03bb\n\u03c12 + z 2 ),\n\u03c1\u2264R\n0\n10\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03a8(\u03c1) =\n(10)\n\u221a\n\uf8f4\n2 +z 2 )\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1\nK\n(b\n\u03c1)exp(\u2212\u03bb\n\uf8f3NJ (r R) 0 10\n, \u03c1>R\n0\n\n10\n\nK0 (b10 R)\n\nThe normalization constant N is given by\nN \u22122 = \u22122\u03c0\n\nd\n(A + B)\nd\u03bb\n\n3\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhere\nA=\nand\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1=R\n\nd\u03c1\u03c1J02 (r10 R)K0 (2\u03bb\u03c1)\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c1=0\n\nZ\nJ02 (r10 R) \u03c1=\u221e\nB= 2\nd\u03c1\u03c1K02 (b10 R)K0 (2\u03bb\u03c1).\n(13)\nK0 (b10 R) \u03c1=R\nCalculating the Potential energy< V > and the kinetic energy < K.E >, it\nis found that\nA\nB\ndB\n< V >= \u22124\u03c0e2 N 2 (\n+\n) \u2212 2\u03c0N 2 Vb (T ) ,\n(14)\n\u01eb1 (T ) \u01eb2 (T )\nd\u03bb\nand\n~2\nme dB\nme dA\n+\n)\n)(\n2me m1 (T ) d\u03bb\nm2 (T ) d\u03bb\n~2\nme 2 dA\nme 2 dB\n\u2212 2\u03c0N 2 (\n)(\nr10\n\u2212\nb\n)\n2me m1 (T )\nd\u03bb\nm2 (T ) 10 d\u03bb\n~2\nme\nme\n+ 2\u03c0N 2 (\n\u2212\n)](15)\n)(2\u03bbR2 )[K0 (2\u03bbR)J02 (r10 R)(\n2me\nm1 (T ) m2 (T )\n\n< K.E >= \u2212 2\u03c0N 2 \u03bb2 (\n\nbut\n\n2\n~2 b210\n~2 r10\n+\n,\n(16)\n2m1 (T ) 2m2 (T )\nThe total energy E(R, T ) =< T > + < K.E > can be obtained using\nequations(14),(15),(16)together with equation (11)\n\nVb (T ) =\n\ndA\ne\n\u03bb2 ( mm\n+\nme 2\n1 (T ) d\u03bb\nE(R, T ) =\nr10 +\nm1 (T )\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n2\u03bbR2 ( mm\n\u2212\n1 (T )\n\nme dB\n0\n) + 4( \u01eb1\u01eb(T\nA\nm2 (T ) d\u03bb\n)\ndA\n+ dB\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\nme\n2\n)(K\n(2\u03bbR)J\n(r\n0\n0 10 R))\nm2 (T )\ndA\n+ dB\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\n\n+\n\n\u01eb0\nB)\n\u01eb2 (T )\n\n(17)\n\nin the last equation we put the length in the bohr radius units aB and the\nenergy in the Rydberg units Rb .\n~2 r 2\nThe binding energy Eb (R, T ) = 2m10e is then given by:\nEb (R, T ) = \u2212\n+\n\nme dB\n0\n0\n) + 4( \u01eb1\u01eb(T\nA + \u01eb2\u01eb(T\nB)\nm2 (T ) d\u03bb\n)\n)\ndA\n+ dB\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\nme\n2\ne\n2\u03bbR2 ( mm\n\u2212\n)(K\n0 (2\u03bbR)J0 (r10 R))\nm2 (T )\n1 (T )\ndA\n+ dB\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\ndA\ne\n+\n\u03bb2 ( mm\n1 (T ) d\u03bb\n\n4\n\n(18)\n\n\fAccording to the variational method, the right-hand side of the last equation\nis maximized with respect to \u03bb to obtain a lower bound of the binding energy.\n\n3\n\nResults and Discussions\n\nFigure (1) shows the dependence of the binding energy on the wire radius\nR for three different values of temperatures,T = 100K, T = 300K,and T =\n500K, at aluminium concentration x = 0.3. At a given temperature the\nbinding energy has a peak at a certain value of the wire radius , Rmax , for\nthis value the Coulomb interaction between the electron and the impurity is\nmaximum due to the high localization of the wave function inside the well.\nFor R > Rmax the binding energy decreases since the electron become less\nconfined to the impurity due to the fact that the wave function becomes\nmore spread out over the well. For R < Rmax the probability of finding the\nelectron outside the well increases , the wave function penetrates through the\nsurrounding barrier region, which leads to decrease the binding energy. The\nresults shown in figure (1) show also that the difference between the binding\nenergy at a temperature of 100K and that corresponds to a temperature\nof 300K for a QWW radius of 0.05aB is about 11%. While this difference\nis about 23% in case of T = 100K and T = 500K .In fact, this difference\ndecreases by increasing the wire radius.\nFigure (2) shows how the binding energy varies with the temperature for a\ncertain value of the wire radius, R = 0.5aB , at three values of aluminium\nconcentration x = 0.15, x = 0.30 , and x = 0.45, it can be concluded from\nfigure (2) that the binding energy increases by decreasing the temperature\nand increasing the aluminium concentration, x. Increasing the value of x\nmeans increasing the value of the potential barrier, which in turns leads to\na stronger confinement of the electron inside the QWW, and consequently\ngreater binding energy.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe effect of temperature on the binding energy of a shallow hydrogenic impurity in a QWW is important and it should be taken into consideration . It\nis also found there is enhancement in this binding energy as the temperature\n\n5\n\n\fis lowered for a certain QWW radius.\n\nReferences\n[1] Bastard G , Phys.
