BACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK\n\nWireless communication has experienced an impressive\ngrowth during the last decades. Lately, new techniques such\nas cooperation among nodes and network coding have been\nintroduced in order to improve the network's performance and\nprovide the communication with robustness, diversity, higher\ndata rates and security. These new technologies generate the\nneed of designing new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols that exploit the benefits of the aforementioned techniques\nin order to efficiently use the network resources.\nThe concept of cooperation was introduced by Cover et al.\n[1] in their fundamental paper on relay channels. Their work\nanalyzed the capacity of the three-node network consisting of\na transmitter, a receiver and a partner (relay)1 . In their model,\nthe spatial diversity gain is obtained by exploiting different\nchannels seen by different nodes for transmitting data.\nOn the other hand, network coding is an area that has\nemerged in 2000 [2]-[3], and since then has attracted an\nincreasing interest, as it promises to have a significant impact\nin both theory and practice of networks. We can broadly\ndefine network coding as allowing intermediate nodes in a\nnetwork to not only forward but also process the incoming\ninformation flows. Most of the work on this topic focuses on\nthe physical layer aspect [4]-[7] while only few works examine\nthese techniques considering the MAC layer effect [8]-[10].\nThe main contribution of our proposed scheme lies on the\nfact that we combine both cooperative and network coding\ntechniques in order to enhance the system's performance. To\nthe best of our knowledge, there is no proposed MAC scheme\nin the literature that implements network coding in cooperative\nARQ schemes, while there is a limited number of papers\nthat apply network coding in cooperative schemes that take\n1 Note that the words \"partner\", \"relay\" and \"helper\" are used interchangeably in this paper.\n\nA. Cooperative Communication\nIn the context of cooperative communications, several\nschemes focused on MAC layer aspect have been already\nproposed in literature [12]-[18]. These works can be classified into two main categories: i) the cooperative ARQbased protocols and ii) the protocols that transform one-hop\ntransmissions to multi-hop transmissions by exploiting the\nmulti-rate capabilities of the wireless systems.\n1) Cooperative ARQ-based protocols: Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) algorithms are two basic error control methods for data communications [19]. ARQ schemes have received considerable\nattention for data transmissions due to their simplicity and\nhigher reliability, compared to FEC schemes.\nRegarding the protocols falling in this category [12]-[14],\nthe retransmissions are initiated by the destination after an\nerroneous packet reception. The helpers in a network are\nenabled to relay the original packets to a specific destination,\nas ARQ defines, using higher data rates or better channel\nconditions in terms of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values.\n2) Protocols that transform one-hop transmissions to multihop transmissions: By using the concept of adaptive modulation [20], mobile stations in a multi-rate wireless network\nassign the modulation scheme and transmission rate according\nto the detected Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and the required\ntransmission quality. Each modulation scheme could be further\nmapped to a range of SNR in a given transmission power.\nTo achieve high transmission efficiency in wireless systems,\nstations select the highest available rate modulation scheme\naccording to the detected SNR.\nThe protocols of this class [15]-[18] transform single onehop transmissions to multi-hop transmissions according to\nthe channel conditions. Specifically, when the channel state\n\n\fbetween the relay and the destination is better than the channel\nbetween the source and the destination, a two-hop transmission\nis preferred instead of the direct transmission.\nB. Cooperation and Network Coding\nLast years, there is a trend towards using network coding\nin cooperative communications. The initial attempts for developing network coding-based cooperative communications focused on physical layer schemes [21]-[23]. These approaches\nrefer to the coding gain and optimal power allocation in\nsimple cooperative topologies, usually considering one relay\nor cooperation among the users.\nHowever, the innovation of using network coding in cooperative communications is not confined only in the physical\nlayer. Tan et al. [11] presented one of the few works that\nfocus on MAC layer aspect of network coding-based cooperative communication. Their proposed protocol, called CODE,\nexploits the benefits of both network coding and multi-rate\ncapability of IEEE 802.11 Standard. Specifically, the coding\nof the packets takes place at the relay nodes, under two\nbasic conditions: i) the direct link between the sender and\nthe receiver is poor and exists one or more relay candidates\nthat experience better link conditions and ii) the traffic is\nbidirectional.\nIII. P ROPOSED N ETWORK C ODING - BASED C OOPERATIVE\nARQ S CHEME\nA. Motivation\nThe main motivation for this paper lies on exploiting the\nadvantages of both cooperative communication and network\ncoding. The limited number of work found in the literature\nrelated to applying network coding in cooperative schemes\nhas led us to implement a new MAC protocol, called Network\nCoding-based Cooperative Automatic Repeat reQuest (NCCARQ), exclusively designed for cooperative networks. The\ncooperation during the operation of the protocol results in a\ndistributed cooperative ARQ scheme, while network coding\ntechniques are used in order to improve the performance of\nthe system.\nThe main design goal of NCC-ARQ is twofold: i) to enable\nthe IEEE 802.11 stations to request their neighborhood to\ncooperate upon the erroneous reception of a data packet and\nii) to allow partner nodes to code the data packets to be\ntransmitted before relaying them. The aforementioned goals\nwill be further clarified once we will have described the\noperation of the protocol. Following, the operation of the\nprotocol is explained in detail, while a simple scenario subjects\nto the initial principles of NCC-ARQ is depicted in Figure 1.\nB. Protocol Description\nWhen NCC-ARQ is applied in the network, all the nodes\nshould operate in promiscuous mode in order to be able to\ncapture all ongoing transmissions and cooperate, if required. In\naddition, they should keep a copy of any received data packet\n(regardless of its destination address) until it is acknowledged\nby the destination station.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nGeneral idea for NCC-ARQ scheme\n\nWhenever a data packet is received with errors at the\ndestination node, a cooperation phase can be initiated. The\nerror control could be performed by checking a cyclic redundancy code (CRC) attached to the header of the packet\nor any other equivalent mechanism. The cooperation phase\nis initiated by the destination station by transmitting a Call\nfor Cooperation (CFC) message to the best relay2 in terms of\nchannel conditions (i.e. SINR) after sensing the channel idle\nfor a Short Interframe Space (SIFS) period. This message has\nthe form of a control packet and higher priority over regular\ndata traffic, since data transmissions in IEEE 802.11 take place\nafter a longer period of silence (DIFS). Furthermore, in the\nspecial but not rare case of bidirectional traffic, when the\ndestination station has a data packet for the source station,\nit transmits this packet piggybacked with the CFC message.\nUpon the reception of the CFC, the helper node gets ready to\nforward its information. Since the relay has already stored the\npackets that destined both to the destination (the cooperative\npacket) and to the source (the piggybacked packet), it creates a\nnew coded packet by combining the two existing data packets,\nusing the XOR method. In this point we have to state that\nNCC-ARQ uses the same frame structure and follows the same\nprinciples with the IEEE 802.11 Standard, thus maintaining\nthe backwards compatibility with it. However, there have been\nsome modifications that are necessary in order for the protocol\nto exploit efficiently the advantages of using both cooperative\nand network coding techniques:\n1) There is no expected ACK packet associated to the\ndata packets that are sent piggybacked with the CFC\nmessage.\n2) In case of bidirectional traffic, the packet that is destined\nback to the source is sent along with the Call for\nCooperation packet, without taking part in the contention\nphase.\n3) There are ACK packets for the multicast transmission\nof the coded packet in order to provide a reliable\n2 Note that the most appropriate relay selection algorithm for our scheme\nis the one proposed by Li et al. [24], which considers the design of joint\nnetwork coding and relay selection in two-way relay channels.\n\n\fcommunication scheme.\nOnce the source and the destination receive the network\ncoded packet from the relay, they are able to decode it and\nextract the respective original data packets. Subsequently, they\nacknowledge the received data packet by transmitting the\nrespective ACK, thus terminating the cooperation phase. In\ncase that the received coded packets could not be decoded after\na certain maximum cooperation timeout due to transmission\nerrors, the relay is obliged to forward again the network coded\npacket.\n\nwhere E[TA ] denotes the average time for a transmission of\na single data packet between the source and the destination,\nwhile E[TCOOP ] corresponds to the average time required for\nthe cooperative transmission scheme to be completed.\nFurthermore, E[TA ] is directly correlated with the network\nconfiguration, while E[TCOOP ] represents the average delay\nof the cooperation phase due to the contention among the\nnodes and the number of required retransmissions, as well.\nIn this paper we assume that the retransmissions take place\nusing always the best relay in term of channel conditions, thus\neliminating the need of contention among the relays. Hence,\nthe term E[TCOOP ] can be analytically expressed as\nE[TCOOP ] = TSIF S + TCF C + TB + TDIF S + TON C +\n+ E[r] * TA\u2295B + TSIF S + TACK + TSIF S + TACK\n\nC. Operational Example\nIn this subsection we provide a simple example in order to\nclarify the operation of the protocol. A basic network topology\nwith 3 stations is considered, all of them in the transmission\nrange of each other. A source station (S) transmits a data\npacket (A) to a destination station (D) which has also a\npacket (B) destined to the source station. There is also one\nrelay (R) that has been chosen as the most appropriate helper\nnode in terms of Signal to Interference-Noise Ratio (SINR)\nand supports this particular bidirectional communication. The\nwhole procedure is depicted in Figure 2 and explained as\nfollows:\n1) At instant t1 , station S sends the data packet A to station\nD.\n2) Upon reception, at instant t2 , station D fails to demodulate the packet A, thus transmitting a CF C packet to\nR along with the data packet B, destined to the station\nS.\n3) At instant t3 , the relay R transmits the coded packet\nA \u2295 B to the nodes S and D simultaneously.\n4) At instant t4 the station D sends back an ACK packet\nsince it is able to decode properly the XOR-ed packet\nand retrieve the original packet A.\n5) At instant t5 the node S acknowledges the packet B\nsince it is able to decode properly the coded packet A \u2295\nB.\n\n(2)\n\nIn the above expression, TSIF S and TDIF S represent the\nduration of SIF S and DIF S waiting times, respectively.\nTCF C , TACK and TB denote the transmission times of the\npackets CF C, ACK and B, respectively. Furthermore, TA\u2295B\nrepresents the transmission time for a network coded packet,\nwhile TON C is the overhead time that a relay needs in order\nto perform the network coding techniques. E[r] is the average\nnumber of the retransmissions that are required in order to\nproperly decode the X-OR packets at the destination nodes.\nIt depends on the channel conditions and specifically on the\npacket error rate (P ER) between the relay and the destination\nnodes. Lower values of P ER imply higher probability for\nsuccessful decoding of the packets at the destination nodes.\nThis relationship could be mathematically expressed as:\nE[r] = 1/(1 \u2212 P ERR\u2192D )\n\n(3)\n\n2) Throughput Analysis: Two packets are delivered simultaneously to the respective destination nodes by applying\nnetwork coding techniques in each transmission cycle of NCCARQ. Thus, the system's aggregated throughput can be defined\nas:\nS[b/s] = 2 *\n\nE[P ]\nE[D]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere E[P ] represents the average packet payload, while\nE[D] derives by the formulas (1) and (2) and has already\nbeen analyzed in the previous subsection. Furthermore, the\ncoefficient 2 in formula (4) is used to express that two packets\nare delivered in each transmission.\nIV. P ERFORMANCE R ESULTS\n\nFig. 2.\n\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the NCC-ARQ we\nhave developed an event-driven C++ simulator that executes\nthe rules of the protocol. In this section we present the\nsimulation set up and results of our experiments.\n\nNCC-ARQ example of operation\n\nA. Simulation Scenario\nD. Protocol Analysis\n1) Delay Analysis: The total time that is required in order for two packets to be exchanged in NCC-ARQ can be\ncomputed as:\nE[D] = E[TA ] + E[TCOOP ]\n\n(1)\n\nWe simulate an 802.11g network formed by a pair of\ntransmitter-receiver (the two nodes are both transmitting and\nreceiving data) and a relay node that facilitates the communication, all of them in the transmission range of each other.\nFurthermore, the relay node is able to perform network coding\nto its buffered packets before relaying them. In order to focus\n\n\fon the analysis of the impact of both network coding and\ncooperative communication, the following assumptions have\nbeen made:\n1) The traffic is bidirectional, i.e. the destination node has\nalways a packet destined back to the source node.\n2) Original transmissions from source to destination are\nalways received with errors, thus initiating a cooperative\nphase.\n3) The channel between the source and the destination is\nerror symmetric, i.e. P ERS\u2192D = P ERD\u2192S\n4) The packet error rate (P ER) - and consequently the\nrequired number of retransmissions (E[r]) that have to\nbe made by the relay until the packets received correctly\n- is known a priori.\nThe configuration parameters of the stations in the network\nare summarized in TABLE I considering the IEEE 802.11g\nPHY layer [25]. Furthermore, the time for applying network\ncoding TON C is considered to be negligible, since the coding\ntakes place between only two packets.\nTABLE I\nS YSTEM PARAMETERS\nParameter\nMAC Header\nPHY Header\nACK, CFC\nSource Control Rate\nRelay Control Rate\n\nValue\n34 bytes\n96 \u03bcsec\n14 bytes\n6Mb/s\n6Mb/s\n\nParameter\nDATA packets\nSIFS\nDIFS\nSource Data Rate\nRelay Data Rate\n\nValue\n1500 bytes\n10 \u03bcsec\n50 \u03bcsec\n6Mb/s\n54Mb/s\n\nFig. 3.\n\nSimulation Scenario\n\nWe can see that the throughput in NCC-ARQ for one retransmission (the minimum number when the initial transmission\ncontains errors) is 7.52 Mb/s while in simple cooperative\nschemes the throughput is approximately 4.3 Mb/s. Upon the\nincrease in the number of required retransmissions (x-axe), the\nthroughput gain is decreased, remaining though at high levels\n(75-85%). This significant improvement makes sense since the\nnumber of total transmissions in NCC-ARQ scheme is lower\ncompared to C-ARQ, as the packets are sent coded and the\nnumber of the CFC packets is decreased as well. Furthermore,\nin NCC-ARQ the cooperation phase is initiated only once\nwhen the traffic is bidirectional, thus saving time compared to\nother cooperative schemes where the cooperation takes place\nupon every erroneous packet reception.\n10\n\nB. Simulation Results\nFigure 4 shows that the numerical and the simulation results\nare perfectly matched, thus verifying our analysis. In addition,\ncomparing with simple cooperative schemes which have the\nadvantage of spatial diversity through relays without any\nnetwork coding capability, we can achieve an enhancement in\nthe network's performance up to 85% in terms of throughput.\n\nNCC\u2212ARQ an.\nNCC\u2212ARQ sim.\nC\u2212ARQ sim.\n\n9\n8\n7\nThroughput (Mb/s)\n\nThe simulation scenario, which is depicted in Figure 3,\nshows the topology of the network. Apart from the assumptions that have already been mentioned, we further assume that\nthe transmission data rates between the relay and the source\nor the destination is 54 Mb/s, as the relay is located close to\nboth nodes, while the data rate between the source and the\ndestination is 6 Mb/s. The network operates under saturated\nconditions, which means that the nodes have always packets\nto send in their buffers.\nIn order to evaluate our approach, we compare our scheme\nwith a simple cooperative ARQ scheme (C-ARQ), where\nthe bidirectional communication takes place in two steps.\nIn the first step, node S sends the packet to D and, upon\nthe erroneous reception, D transmits the CF C packet, thus\ntriggering the relay to retransmit the packet. In the second\nstep, node D transmits its own packet to S and the same\nprocedure as in the first step is repeated, thus consuming\nvaluable network resources.\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nFig. 4.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\nE[r] Number of Retransmissions\n\n5\n\nSystem's Aggregated Throughput (NCC-ARQ vs C-ARQ)\n\nFigure 5 presents the packet delay in both Network Codingbased and simple Cooperative ARQ schemes. In this point, we\nmust recall that two packets are delivered to their respective\ndestinations in each transmission cycle of NCC-ARQ. Hence,\nin order to be accurate, we compare the delay in NCC-ARQ\nwith the time required for two packets to be exchanged in\nC-ARQ.\nAs it can be observed, we can achieve significantly lower\npacket delay by using network coding techniques. Specifically,\nthe average time that is required for two packets to be\ntransmitted using C-ARQ is 5.6 msec in channels where one\n\n\fretransmission is necessary, reaching up to 8 msec when five\nretransmissions are required. On the other hand, the delay\nvalues in NCC-ARQ are 3 and 4.4 msec, for one and five\nretransmissions, respectively. This difference can be rationally\nexplained considering the operation of our proposed NCCARQ scheme, since some data packets are sent to the relay\n(attached to the CFC message), thus avoiding the erroneous\nchannel.\n\u22123\n\n9\n\nx 10\n\nNCC\u2212ARQ an.\nNCC\u2212ARQ sim.\nC\u2212ARQ sim.\n\nTotal Delay (sec)\n\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFig. 5.\n\n3\n4\nE[r] Number of Retransmissions\n\n5\n\nPacket Delay (NCC-ARQ vs C-ARQ)\n\nV. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a novel network coding-based cooperative\nARQ (NCC-ARQ) scheme is presented. Compared to simple\ncooperative ARQ protocols, the proposed solution improves\nup to 85% the network's aggregated bandwidth by minimizing\nthe number of the total transmissions, while the average time\nto transmit data packets is significantly reduced. In order to\ncoordinate the relay set, new MAC protocols that exploit the\nbenefits of network coding should be designed. Our future\nwork will be focused on such issues..\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been funded by the Research Projects\nCO2GREEN(TEC2010-20823), GREENET(264759) and\nNEWCOM++(ICT-216715).\nR EFERENCES\n[1] T.
