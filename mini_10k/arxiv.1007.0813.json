The solution of\nthe Lam\u00e9 Problem is used to determine the pressure distortion coefficient \u03bb for the controlled-clearance\npressure balances including the case of pressure balances with the cylinder made up of two materials.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most important problems in order to improve the performances of the pressure balances\n(especially in the field of high pressure measurements) is the accurate calculation of the pressure\ndistortion coefficient \u03bb. For this purpose, the methods can be classified as theoretical or\nexperimental[6]. Furthermore, according to Dadson et al., the effect of the measured pressure P on\nthe effective area of a piston-cylinder assembly Ae is described by the well known relationship:\nAe = A0 (1 + \u03bbP )\nWhere A0 is the zero-pressure effective area.\nA theoretical method described in this paper is the simplified elastic theory. It is well known that\nJohnson, Newall and Tsiklis (1953-68) have used some relationships based on the simplified elastic\ntheory for the analytical evaluation of the effective area Ae of the piston-cylinder units (PCUs). But\nthose equations are valid in the case of pressure balances with cylinder made up of single material.\nA summary of this work is reported in[6] for both the simple and re-entrant units.\nUnder the same hypotheses used for the simple and reentrant units, we can determine the pressure\ndistortion coefficients of controlled-clearance (CC) PCUs including also the case of composite\ncylinder [1].\nThe analytical method described in this paper was reported in the following publications:\n- [2] is the first publication based on the thesis [1]: this work reports (extracted from [1]) the\nanalytical demonstrations and the two formulae obtained by equations (23) and (28) for the\nPage 1 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\nevaluation of the pressure distortion coefficient of controlled-clearance piston gauges (CCPGs)\nwith the cylinder made up of both single material and two materials respectively; this\ntheoretical aspect was also reported in [10].\n- In [3] there are the two equations mentioned above: in chapter 5.3 (from page 94 to page 100)\nentitled \"The simplified method based on Lam\u00e9 equation\", the two formulae (eqs. (23) and\n(28) given in [1]) are reported to evaluate the pressure distortion coefficient of CCPGs.\nThe analysis of this paper is based on the following steps:\nI) differential formulation of the Lam\u00e9 Problem: Lam\u00e9 theory of the thick-walled cylinder\napplied to the Mechanical theory of elastic equilibrium (section 2);\nII) choice of the model: the model is important to schematize the piston-cylinder assembly; a\nwrong model (as reported in [2,3]) leads to erroneous formulae for \u03bb (sections 3 and 4);\nIII) boundary conditions are necessary to solve the Lam\u00e9 Problem; the solution of the The Lam\u00e9\nProblem allows us to determine the radial displacements for analysing the particular pistoncylinder assembly (sections 3.1 and 4.1);\nIV) on the basis of the hypotheses derived from [6] we can evaluate the pressure distortion\ncoefficient for the CCPGs also for the case of cylinder made up of two materials [1](section\n4.2).\n2. The Lam\u00e9 Problem\nAmong the theoretical methods, the Simplified Elastic Theory is an analytical approach to evaluate\nthe pressure distortion coefficient by the solution of a system of differential equations called the\nLam\u00e9 equations. The results of this analysis allow one to the determination of the stresses and\ndistortions for the case of thick walled cylinder. The method is formally known as The Lam\u00e9\nProblem and the differential formulation of this problem is based on the analysis of the equilibrium\nof an elementary volume [5] (fig.1).\n\nFig. 1 Stress distribution in the axialsymmetric cylindrical structures according to the simplified elastic theory\n(extracted from [1]).\n\nPage 2 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\nBy introducing cylindrical coordinates (x, \u03b8, r), the inner radius of the elementary volume is r and\nthe outer radius is r+dr (dr is infinitesimal).

Controlled clearance pressure balances with the cylinder made up of two materials\nThe technology based on the axial symmetric structures with the cylinder made up of two materials\nis used in the construction of pressure balances for high pressure measurements. The analysis of this\nconfiguration is based on the same hypotheses formulated in the case of the cylinder made up of\nsingle material:\nI) the thick-walled cylinder 1 with open ends, is subject to internal pressure p and external\npressure pm (fig.4a) where p is the pressure distribution in the clearance between the piston and\nthe cylinder. The thick-walled cylinder 2 with open ends is subject to internal pressure pm and\nexternal jacket pressure pj (fig.4b).\nII) no end-loading on cylinder: \u03c3x = 0\nIII) piston loaded with a longitudinal stress \u03c3x = cost = -P and an external pressure p.\nWe can assume the following notation(figures 3, 4):\n- Rc: radius of the external surface of the cylinder 2;\n- rc: radius of the internal surface of the cylinder 1;\n- p: pressure applied to the internal surface of cylinder 1: pressure distribution in the clearance\nbetween piston and cylinder.\n- pj: pressure applied to the external surface of cylinder 2: jacket pressure.\n- rm: radius of the external surface of the cylinder 1 equal to the radius of the internal surface of\nthe cylinder 2;\n- E1, \u03bd1: Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the internal cylinder;\n- E2, \u03bd2: Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the external cylinder;\n- U1(r): radial elastic displacements of the internal cylinder 1.\n- U2(r):: radial elastic displacements of the external cylinder 2.\n- pm: interface pressure;\n- P: pressure applied to the piston base: pressure measurement.\n\nFig. 3 Transversal section of the cylinder made up of two materials for a controlled-clearance pressure Balance.\n\nAlso for the CCPGs with the cylinder made up of two materials, the evaluation of the pressure\ndistortion coefficient \u03bb is based on the solution of the Lam\u00e9 Problem. For this theoretical analysis\nthe literature gives two models:\nPage 10 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\n- MODEL I (Saragosa S., 2001).\nA model without the external cylinder (fig.4a): the effect of cylinder 2 is replaced by the pressure\npm applied to the external surface of the internal cylinder (cylinder 1); the assembly can be\nschematized as a controlled-clearance pressure balance with the cylinder made up of single\nmaterial: the jacket pressure is pm (interface pressure). In this particular case the formula of the\npressure distortion coefficient derives from the equation (23) [1]:\n\n\u03bb=\n\n(3\u03bd\n\np\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n2E p\n\n+\n\n2\n\uf8f6\n1 \uf8eb\uf8ec rc + rm2 \u2212 4\u03c6 \u22c5 rm2\n\uf8f7\n+\n\u03bd\n1\n2\n2\n\uf8f7\n2 E1 \uf8ec\uf8ed\nrm \u2212 rc\n\uf8f8\n\n(26)\n\nwith \u03c6 = pm/P\n- MODEL II (Buonanno G. et al., 2003-2007).\nA model without the internal cylinder 1 fig. 4b): it's obtained by \"removing the internal layer 1 and\nreplacing it with the contact pressure, pmed, applied on the layer 2\" as reported in [2] and in pag.99\nof [3]. This model is wrong for the solution of the The Lam\u00e9 Problem because:\na) it is not a model of a pressure balance;\nb) model II was erroneously correlated (by the authors of the previous publications [2,3]) to the\nequation (28): the wrong model for the right formula; in fact the analysis based on model II\nleads to another equation (completely different from eq. (28)) of the pressure distortion\ncoefficient for the pressure balance with the cylinder made up of two materials: obviously for\nthis model the introduction of piston is not allowed; thus the ratio (3\u03bdp -1)/2Ep is not present in\neqs. (26, 28).\nThis model is valid only for the calculation of pm (interface pressure).\n\nFig. 4 Transversal sections of the cylinder of CCPG (cylinder made of up of 2 materials) for two hypothetical\nmodels.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, this analysis is made using the model I.\n\nPage 11 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\n4.1 Boundary conditions\nIn the particular case of a CCPG with the cylinder made up of two material, the analysis is based on\nthe evaluation of the interface pressure pm for r = rm.

This region represents a\ncritical boundary condition because the position (and deformations) of the O-rings could influence\nsignificantly the values of the pressure distortion coefficient in CC mode. Thus the FEM\nsimulations were made starting with a basic model with the jacket pressure applied in the part of the\nouter surfaces of the cylinder lying between the O-rings up to the axis of the undistorted O-rings\n(58,2 mm). Moreover, a model (developed at the PTB[7]) with the jacket pressure acting on the\nwhole outer surface of the cylinder was also considered.\nIn table 2 is reported [7] a comparison of methods for the calculation of pressure distortion\ncoefficients of the assembly BNM-LNE 200MPa (units #4 and #5).\nTable 2 Pressure distortion coefficients of BNM-LNE 200MPa with FEM and experimental values\nextracted from [7].\n\nP(MPa)\n\n120\n200\n\n5\n40\n120\n200\n(*)\n\n\u03bbCC ( p. p.m. Mpa -1 )\nmethod\nBNM-LNE 200 MPa unit #4\nExperimental\n-0.14\nLam\u00e9\n-0.0487\nFEM-PTB\n0.093\nFEM-NPL\n0.083\nFEM-PTB\n0.117\nFEM-NPL\n0.111\n(*)\nFEM-PTB\n-0.050(*)\nBNM-LNE 200 MPa unit #5\nExperimental\n-0.02\nLam\u00e9\n-0.0487\nFEM-PTB\n0.011\nFEM-PTB\n0.097\nFEM-PTB\n0.154\nFEM-NPL\n0.153\nFEM-PTB\n0.166\nFEM-NPL\n0.165\nFEM-PTB(*)\n-0.043(*)\n\n\u03bbFD ( p. p.m. Mpa -1 )\n0.780\n0.798(**)\n0.802\n0.801\n0.803\n0.800\n\n0.850\n0.798(**)\n\n0.802\n0.800\n0.803\n0.801\n\nmodel with the jacket pressure pj acting on the whole external surface of the cylinder\nvalue obtained using eq.

One of these models (model 2) is analysed in this\npaper: the model with an ideal undistorted gap profile between the piston and the cylinder. The \u03bb\ncalculations (with FEM) were made taking P = (100, 250, 400, 600, 800, 1000) MPa in the CC\nmode and P = (100, 400, 600) MPa in the FD mode.\nBy assuming pj/P = 1/10[8] (controlled clearance mode) in eq. (28) or (29), the CC pressure\ndistortion coefficient for this assembly is equal to:\n\u03bbcc = 0.354 p. p.m. MPa \u22121\nThe jacket pressure distortion coefficient can be calculated with eq.(32):\nn j = 3.973 p. p.m. MPa \u22121\nFrom eq.

Conclusions\nFrom the comparisons of methods (for two different controlled-clearance pressure balances) we can\nobtain the following conclusions:\n- the Simplified Elastic Theory allows one to directly evaluate the pressure distortion coefficient\nwithout simulations, iterative procedures and mesh optimization (used in the FEM analysis).\n- in the particular case of CCPGs where the cylinder consists of two materials, a comparison of\nthe pressure distortion values obtained using FEM simulations (when pressure balances are\nmodelled with an undistorted gap) together with the values obtained in the Simplified Elastic\nTheory reveals a good agreement as shown also in the characterizations of other controlledclearance pressure balances in the Euromet Project 463 (pressure balance BNM-LNE 1GPa [9]);\n\nPage 18 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\n-\n\nin order to optimize FEM simulations, sometimes the Simplified Elastic Theory represents a\nmethod for validating FEM calculations especially in the case of the deviation of FEM\ncalculations from the experimental pressure distortion coefficients [7];\nThe limits of the Simplified Elastic Theory in comparison with the FEM analysis are:\n- when the Simplified Theory is used, the pressure distortion coefficient uncertainties are strongly\ninfluenced by the uncertainties of the elastic constants of the materials used for the realization of\nthe pressure balances;\n- the FEM analysis is based on the numerical integration of more complex derivative equations\n(given in the mechanical theory of elastic equilibrium) including also the evaluation of the shear\nstresses: thus a more accurate analysis of the deformations of the PCUs is carried out;\n- when the simulation with the FEM is undertaken, it is possible to know more detailed\ninformation about the elastic distortions in the gap region of the PCUs;\n- for better understanding the real behaviour of the pressure balances (especially the more\ncomplex CCPGs) the FEM is an useful theoretical tool because more input parameters are\nconsidered in the simulation of the PCUs: for example, detailed boundary conditions and more\ninformation about the dimensional properties of the assemblies.\n\nPage 19 of 20\n\n\fThe Simplified Elastic Theory applied to controlled-clearance pressure balances\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Saragosa Silvano, Caratterizzazione di bilance di pressione mediante l'impiego di metodi\nnumerici e analitici, Master Degree Thesis, Department of Mechanical Engineering,\nUniversity of Cassino-Italy, July 2001.\n[2] Buonanno G, Dell'Isola M, Frattolillo A, Simplified analytical methods to evaluate the\npressure distortion coefficient of controlled-clearance pressure balances (High TemperaturesHigh Pressures), 2003.\n[3] Buonanno G. et al., Ten years of experiences in modelling pressure balances in liquid media\nup to few GPa (University of Cassino), February 2007.\n[4] Dadson R.
