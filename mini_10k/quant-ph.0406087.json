A Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer with an\nunbalanced arm length is used to detect the fluctuations of the phase quadrature at a single side\nband frequency. Using this setup, the non\u2013separability of a pair of quadrature entangled beams is\ndemonstrated experimentally.\nOCIS codes: 270.0270, 270.2500, 270.5570\n\n1\n\n\fFor many applications in quantum communication with continuous variables, such as\nquantum teleportation[1], entanglement swapping[2] and quantum cryptography[3], it is\nrequired that one measures the amplitude and the phase quadrature of the electromagnetic\nfield. A homodyne detector[4] is usually applied to perform phase sensitive measurements\nby the interference of the signal beam and probing of the sidebands with a local oscillator,\nwhich is required to be much brighter than the signal beam. However, for intense signal\nbeams, this requirement gives rise to technical difficulties because the high intensities may\nsaturate the detectors. Phase measurements can also be achieved by rotating the bright\ncarrier (internal local oscillator) with respect to the sidebands. Such frequency dependent\nphase shifts could be accomplished by reflecting the light of a cavity as a result of multiple\nbeam interference. This technique was used in early quantum optical experiments[5, 6].\nHowever, for ultrashort light pulse trains the requirements on the dispersion properties of\nthe resonator are quite demanding. In this Letter, we present an alternative approach in\nwhich the fluctuations of the phase quadrature are measured at a certain sideband frequency\nwithout the use of any local oscillator or resonator. An interferometric setup reminiscent of\nthat used by Inoue and Yamamoto to determine the longitudinal mode partition noise[7] is\nshown to be capable of performing quantum\u2013optical measurements of the phase quadrature\nbelow the shot noise level, by introducing a phase shift between the carrier and the sidebands\ndue to two beam interference. Our setup allows for easy switching between the measurement\nof the phase quadrature and the amplitude quadrature and was used to fully characterize\nquadrature entanglement of a pair of intense pulsed beams.\nThe basic setup is a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (see the inset in Fig. 1), with an\narm length difference \u2206L that introduces a frequency dependent phase shift at a certain\nrf\u2013sideband. For frequencies in the MHz\u2013regime, \u2206L is much larger than the optical wavelength, typically several meters. To describe the interferometer quantum theoretically we\nexpress the input field mode through annihilation operator \u00e2(t) = \u03b1 + \u03b4\u00e2(t), where \u03b1 is\nthe classical amplitude (\u03b1 is assumed real) and where \u03b4\u00e2(t) contains all classical and quantum mechanical fluctuations and having zero mean value. This mode is split at a 50/50\nbeamsplitter and hence mixed with vacuum \u03b4v\u0302(t). The two emerging modes denoted \u00ea(t)\nand f\u02c6(t) are combined at a second 50/50 beamsplitter. The relative optical phase shift\nbetween \u00ea(t) and f\u02c6(t) is denoted \u03c6, the relative delay between the long and the short arms\n\u221a\nof the interferometer is given by \u03c4 = \u2206L/c. Output modes \u0109(t) = 1/ 2(\u00ea(t) + f\u02c6(t)) and\n2\n\n\f\u221a\n\u02c6 = 1/ 2(\u00ea(t) \u2212 f\u02c6(t)) are then given by\nd(t)\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n\u03b1 + \u03b4\u00e2(t) + \u03b4v\u0302(t) + ei\u03c6 \u03b1 + ei\u03c6 \u03b4\u00e2(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2212 ei\u03c6 \u03b4v\u0302(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ,\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6 = 1 \u03b1 + \u03b4\u00e2(t) + \u03b4v\u0302(t) \u2212 ei\u03c6 \u03b1 \u2212 ei\u03c6 \u03b4\u00e2(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) + ei\u03c6 \u03b4v\u0302(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) .\nd(t)\n2\n\n\u0109(t) =\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nFor intense states of light, the interferometer equations can be simplified by use of a linearization approach.

(4)\n2\n\nwhere the quadrature component \u03b4 X\u0302a,\u03c6 is defined by \u03b4 X\u0302a,\u03c6 = ei\u03c6 \u03b4\u00e2\u2020 + e\u2212i\u03c6 \u03b4\u00e2.\nThen, via Fourier transform, the spectral components of the rf\u2013fluctuations at sideband\nfrequency \u03a9 are obtained. Since the phase shift of the spectral components is given by\n\u03a9\u03c4 = \u03b8 (note that the Fourier transformation F gives F f (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = e\u2212i\u03a9\u03c4 F f (t)), and the\noptical phase is adjusted to \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 + 2k\u03c0 (k is an integer), the fluctuations of the sum and\nthe difference photocurrents in frequency space read as\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n,\n\u03b1 \u03b4 X\u0302a,0 + e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b4 X\u0302a,0\n+ \u03b4 X\u0302v,0\n\u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b4 X\u0302v,0\n2\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 \u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n.\n+ e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b4 X\u0302a,\u2212\u03c0/2\n+ \u03b4 X\u0302v,\u03c0/2\n\u2212 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b4 X\u0302v,\u2212\u03c0/2\n= \u03b1 \u03b4 X\u0302a,\u03c0/2\n2\n\n\u03a9\n\u03b4n\u0302\u03a9\nc + \u03b4n\u0302d =\n\n(5)\n\n\u03a9\n\u03b4n\u0302\u03a9\nc \u2212 \u03b4n\u0302d\n\n(6)\n\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nFor \u03b8 = \u03c0, the sum signal yields \u03b4n\u0302\u03a9\nc + \u03b4n\u0302d = \u03b1\u03b4 X\u0302v,0 and the difference signal \u03b4n\u0302c \u2212 \u03b4n\u0302d =\n\u03a9\n\u03b1\u03b4 X\u0302a,\u03c0/2\nwhich is proportional to the spectral component \u03a9 of the phase quadrature of\n\nthe initial field. The delay must therefore be chosen such that a phase shift of \u03c0 between\nthe two arms of the interferometer is introduced at measurement frequency \u03a9m = 2\u03c0fm .\nCorresponding delay \u2206L is then given by \u2206L = cT /2 = c\u03c0/\u03a9m = c/2fm where c is the\nspeed of light and T is the period of the rf\u2013signal at the frequency \u03a9m .\nThe experimental setup for the phase measuring interferometer is depicted in Fig. 1.\nIt contains a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer followed by a balanced detection system using\nhigh efficiency InGaAs\u2013photodiodes (Epitaxx ETX 500). The first beam splitter in the\ninterferometer is made of a polarizing beam splitter and a \u03bb/2\u2013plate. It is therefore possible\n3\n\n\fto switch between phase measurement creating equal intensity in both arms and amplitude\nmeasurement, where all light propagates through one arm. The latter situation is equivalent\nto a balanced detection scheme, in which the sum and the difference signal provides the\namplitude noise and the shot noise level respectively. The variances of the photocurrent\nfluctuations were recorded with a pair of spectrum analyzers (8590L from HP) at a resolution\nbandwidth of 300kHz and a video bandwidth of 30Hz. The measurement time for each\nrecorded trace as in Fig. 2 was 5s. The difference of the DC\u2013powers of the two detectors\nserved as error signal and was fed back onto a piezo\u2013mirror in the interferometer to stabilize\nthe optical phase.\nThe quantum source that we characterize with our phase measuring device produces\nintense quadrature entangled light pulses. An OPO pumped by a mode locked Ti:Sapphire\nlaser is used as light source. It produces pulses of 100fs at a center wavelength of 1530nm\nand at a repetition rate of 82MHz. The nonlinear Kerr effect experienced by intense pulses in\noptical fibers [8] is used to generate amplitude squeezed light pulses employing an asymmetric\nfibre Sagnac interferometer [9, 10]. By use of the linear interference of amplitude squeezed\nbeams, intense entangled light was generated utilizing the fibre optical setup described by\nSilberhorn et al.[11] To demonstrate sub\u2013shot noise performance of the interferometer each\nof the entangled beams was directed into a phase measuring interferometer, we verified the\ncorrelations of the detected photocurrents and compared them with the corresponding shot\nnoise level.\nWorking with a pulsed system, phase measurements can only be performed at certain\nfrequencies where interference occurs, as possible delays are governed by the repetition\nfrequency frep of the laser source \u2206L = cnTrep = cn/frep (n is an integer number; Trep is the\ntime between two pulses). Possible measurement frequencies are then given by fm = frep /2n.\nIn our case, with a repetition rate of 82MHz, the arm length difference must be a multiple\nof 3.66m, corresponding to the distance between two successive pulses. For a frequency of\n20.5MHz an arm length difference of 7.32m is required. To achieve high interference contrast\nand hence high efficiency of the interferometer, not only the phase fronts of the light from\nthe long and the short arm have to be matched carefully, but also the temporal overlap of\nthe pulses.\nTo characterize the entanglement source, first the squeezing resources used to generate\nentanglement were investigated using the two interferometers in the amplitude quadrature\n4\n\n\fsettings. In the experiment, 2.1dB and 2.4dB of amplitude squeezing were observed for the\ntwo input beams respectively. The level of squeezing is limited by the losses of the beams\nin the interferometers, by the use of four imperfect detectors, and non-optimum balancing.\nIn a next step, the expected quantum correlations (anticorrelations) for the phase (amplitude) quadrature were verified. These were checked by looking at the noise level of the\ndifference (sum) signal of each of the photocurrents of the two entangled beams for the\nphase (amplitude) measurement. The phase correlations are \u22121.2dB below the shot noise\n\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nlevel (see trace 1 in Fig. 2a) corresponding to a squeezing variance h(\u03b4 X\u03021,\u03c0/2\n\u2212\u03b4 X\u03022,\u03c0/2\n)2 i/2 =\n\n0.76 \u00b1 0.02 while the amplitude correlations were at \u22122.0dB (see trace 1 in Fig. 2b) cor-\n\n\u03a9\n\u03a9 2\nresponding to a squeezing variance h(\u03b4 X\u03021,0\n+ \u03b4 X\u03022,0\n) i/2 = 0.63 \u00b1 0.02 (indices 1,2 refer to\n\ntwo entangled modes). The discrepancy between the noise level of the amplitude and the\nphase quadrature measurement comes from imperfect mode matching in the latter case. We\nachieved a visibility of 85%, introducing additional losses of 28% for the phase measurement. Thus, instead of \u22122dB of correlations as in the amplitude measurement we do not\nexpect correlations stronger than \u22121.3dB in the phase measurement, which agrees with the\nmeasurement results.\nThe noise level of the phase quadrature measurement of the individual entangled beams\n(traces 3 in Fig.2a) is 6dB below the corresponding sum\u2013signal of these two beams (trace\n4), which is due to the quantum correlations of the entangled beams. The same applies for\nthe noise levels of the amplitude quadrature. Note that the noise level of the individual\nbeams is \u223c18dB above the shot noise level due to the high degree of excess phase noise of\nthe initial squeezed light, introduced by self phase modulation as well as by guided acoustic\nwave Brillouin scattering [12].\nIn this experiment, for the first time, non\u2013classical correlations in the phase quadrature\nhave been observed directly for intense pulsed light. No additional interaction between\nthe individual entangled beams [11] is necessary to demonstrate sub shot noise correlations in the phase quadrature. According to the non\u2013separability criterion by Duan [13] et\nal. and Simon [14] for Gaussian systems, the existence of nonclassical correlations implies\nq\n\u221a\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9 2\n\u2212 \u03b4 X\u03022,\u03c0/2\n)2 ih(\u03b4 X\u03021,0\n+ \u03b4 X\u03022,0\n) i/4 < 1. Since \u2206 = 0.76 * 0.63 < 1 we can\n\u2206 = h(\u03b4 X\u03021,\u03c0/2\nconclude qualitatively that the state is non\u2013separable. Because our bipartite Gaussian state\nis symmetric we can also quantify the entanglement of formation EF using proposition 2 in\nref. [15] and we find EF = 0.22 \u00b1 0.02.\n5\n\n\fThe implemented phase measurement device opens the possibility of performing a variety of experiments in the field of quantum information and communication, where intense\nlight beams are used and phase measurements are required. For example, a quantum key\ndistribution scheme relying on quadrature entanglement[16] could be implemented without\nsending a local oscillator together with the signal beams. Also the full experimental demonstration of continuous variable entanglement swapping using intense light beams seems to\nbe possible[2].\nIn conclusion, we experimentally demonstrated a setup for measuring the quantum fluctuations of the phase quadrature on intense, pulsed light without using a separate local\noscillator or a resonator. We prove sub\u2013shot noise resolution by resolving phase correlations\nbelow the shot noise level on a pair of quadrature entangled beams.\nWe would like to thank N. L\u00fctkenhaus, P.
