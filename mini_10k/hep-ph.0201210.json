We calculate the rate of this process taking account of the S \u2212 D\nmixing effect in \u03c8 \u2032 . It is shown that the rate is about a factor of 3 smaller than the simple result\nwithout considering the S \u2212 D mixing effect. Possible detecting channels are suggested and it is\nshown that \u03c8(11 P1 ) is able to be found with the accumulation of 3 \u00d7 107 events of \u03c8 \u2032 at BEPC.\n\nPACS number(s): 13.20.Gd, 13.30.Eg, 14.40.Cs\nSearching for the 1 P1 states of heavy quarkonia is of interest since the difference between the 1 P1 mass M1 P1\nand the center-of-gravity (c.o.g) of the 3 PJ mass Mc.o.g = (5M3 P2 + 3M3 P1 + M3 P0 )/9 gives useful information\nabout the spin-dependent interactions between the heavy quark and antiquark. Theoretical investigations of\nthe general structure of the spin-dependent interactions and the formula for the spin-dependent potential up to\nO(1/m2 ) in the 1/m expansion have been carried out in various approaches [1,2]. Experimentally, neither the\n\u03c8(11 P1 ) state nor the \u03a5(11 P1 ) state has been found yet1 . The best way of searching for the \u03c8(11 P1 ) state is to\nlook for the process\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 ) + \u03c0 0\n\n(1)\n\nat an e+ e\u2212 collider in the \u03c4 -charm energy range. Many years ago, the Crystal Ball Group searched for this\nprocess with a negative result, and the obtained upper limit for the branching ratio is [5]\nB(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 ) < 0.46%,\n\n95% C.L.\n\n(2)\n\nfor M\u03c8(11 P1 ) = 3520 MeV. Now the most promising collider for this kind of experiment is Beijing ElectronPositron Collider (BEPC).\nTheoretically, a simple single-channel calculation of the transition rate (1) based on the QCD multipole expansion [6,7] using the Cornell potential model [8] was given in our previous paper [9]. The obtained results\nare\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1M\n\u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 ) = 0.12\nkeV,\n\u03b1E\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1M\nB(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 ) = (4.3 \u00b1 0.5)\n\u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n(3)\n\u03b1E\n2\n2\nwhere \u03b1E = gE\n/4\u03c0 and \u03b1M = gM\n/4\u03c0 are phenomenological coupling constants for color electric dipole and\ncolor magnetic dipole gluon radiations, respectively. The branching ratio here is obtained from the updated total\nwidth \u0393tot (\u03c8 \u2032 ) = 227 \u00b1 31 keV [10], and it is a little different from the value in Ref. [9]. The uncertainty in\nthe branching ratio comes from the experimental error in \u0393tot (\u03c8 \u2032 ). Phenomenological determination of the ratio\n\u03b1M /\u03b1E is not so certain [9]. From the theoretical point of view, the two coupling constants should not be so\ndifferent, so we roughly take a possible range\n\n\u2217\n\nMailing address.\n\u221a\nIn 1992, the E760 collaboration claimed that they saw a significant enhancement in p\u0304 + p \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03c0 0 at s = 3526.2\n1\nMeV which was supposed to be a candidate of \u03c8(1 P1 ) [3]. However, such an enhancement has not been confirmed by the\nsuccessive E835 experiment with significantly higher statistics [4].\n1\n\n1\n\n\f\u03b1M\n\u2248 1 \u2212 3.\n\u03b1E\n\n(4)\n\nin the calculation. We see that the theoretically predicted B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 ) is consistent with the Crystal\nBall limit (2), and is not much smaller than the limit, thus it is hopeful that we will find the \u03c8(11 P1 ) state in\nthe near future at BEPC.\nSince the \u03c8 \u2032 mass M\u03c8\u2032 = 3685.96 \u00b1 0.09 MeV is quite close to the DD\u0304 threshold Eth = 3729.0 \u00b1 1.0 MeV\n[10], it is expected that the coupled-channel effect may affect the transition rate. Complete coupled-channel\ncalculation of the transition rate is tedious. A coupled-channel formulation of the hadronic transitions between\nheavy quarkonium states and the transition rates for \u03a5\u2032 \u2192 \u03a5\u03c0\u03c0, \u03a5\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03a5\u03c0\u03c0, and \u03a5\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03a5\u2032 \u03c0\u03c0 have been given in\nRef. [11]. Further improved study of the coupled-channel theory of hadronic transitions in the heavy quarkonium\nsystems will be presented in a future paper. We notice that an important aspect of the coupled-channel effect\naffecting the transition rate is the state mixing. From a reasonable coupled-channel model, the unitarized quark\nmodel (UQM) [12], we see that \u03c8 \u2032 is not a pure 2S state. Apart from negligibly small ingredients (an order of\nmagnitude smaller), \u03c8 \u2032 mainly contains \u03c82S and \u03c81D states. We denote this mixing as\n\u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c82S cos \u03b8 + \u03c81D sin \u03b8,\n\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\u03c82S sin \u03b8 + \u03c81D cos \u03b8.\n\n(5)\n\nThe UQM gives \u03b8 \u2248 \u22128.5\u25e6 [12]. It is the purpose of this paper to calculate the influence of such an S \u2212 D mixing\non the transition rate (1)2 .\nInstead of taking a specific model of the coupled-channel effect, we take a simple and phenomenological approach\nsuch as was done in studying hadronic transitions of \u03c8(3770) in Ref. [13] and in studying radiative transitions of\nheavy quarkonia in Ref. [14], i.e., we determine the mixing angle \u03b8 by fitting the experimental value of the ratio of\nthe leptonic decay rates \u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )/\u0393(\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ). In the simple Cornell potential model, the so-determined\n\u03b8 is [13]\n\u03b8 = \u221210\u25e6 .\n\n(6)\n\nThis is consistent with the mixing angle \u03b8 \u2248 \u22128.5\u25e6 in the UQM mentioned above. In this paper, we take an\nimproved potential model by Chen and Kuang, which reflects more about QCD and leads to more successful\nphenomenological results [15]. The potential reads\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n53\n2\u03b3\n+\nE\n16\u03c0 1 \uf8ef\n75 \u2212 462 ln f (r) \uf8fa\n(7)\nV (r) = kr \u2212\n\uf8f01 +\n\uf8fb,\n25 rf (r)\nf (r)\n625 f (r)\nwhere k = 0.1491 GeV2 is the string tension related to the Regge slope [15], \u03b3E is the Euler constant, and f (r) is\n\uf8ee\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 1 \u2212 exp\n\uf8ef 1\n1 \u039bMS\n\uf8ef\n+ 4.62 \u2212 1 \u2212\nf (r) = ln \uf8ef\n4 \u039bI\n\uf8f0 \u039bMS r\nMS\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0015 2 \u001b \uf8f92\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012 I\n\u039b\n\u2212 15 3 MS \u2212 1 \u039bMS r\n\uf8fa\n\u039bMS\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa ,\n\u039bMS r\n\uf8fb\n\n(8)\n\nin which \u039bIMS = 180 MeV. Taking \u039bMS = 200 MeV 3 , we obtain the following wave functions at the origin\n5 \u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (0)\n\u221a 1D 2 = 0.0262 GeV3/2 ,\n2 2mc\n\n\u03c82S (0) = 0.199 GeV3/2 ,\n\n(9)\n\n2\nFrom Ref. [12], we see that state-mixings in \u03a5\u2032\u2032 is an order of magnitude smaller, so we expect that the single-channel\nresult of the rate of \u03a5\u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u03a5(11 P1 )\u03c0\u03c0 given in Ref. [9] will not be much affected by the state-mixing effect.\n3\nOur calculation shows that the determined \u03b8 is not sensitive to the value of \u039bM S . For example, a 50 MeV variation of\n\u039bM S causes only a < 1% change of \u03b8.\n\n2\n\n\fand then, as was done in Ref. [13], we determine\n\u03b8 = \u221212\u25e6\n\n(10)\n\nin this model. This is close to the value (6) in the Cornell model.\nIn general, the initial-state quarkonium \u03a6i and the final-state quarkonium \u03a6f in the hadronic transition\n\u03a6i \u2192 \u03a6f + h [h stands for light hadron(s)] can be described as\nX (f )\nX (i)\n\u03a6f =\nani li \u03c6ni li ,\nanf lf \u03c6nf lf ,\n(11)\n\u03a6i =\nnf lf\n\nni li\n\nwhere \u03c6ni li (\u03c6nf lf ) is the quarkomium state with principal quantum number ni (nf ) and orbital angular momenP\nP\n(f )\n(i)\ntum li (lf ), and the mixing coefficients satisfy ni li ani li = 1 and nf lf anf lf = 1. In the framework of the\nQCD multipole expansion [6,7], the hadronic transition (1) is mainly contributed by the E1 M1 transition, and\nthe transition amplitude is\n\u0013\n\u0012\ngE gM X h\u03a6f |(sQ \u2212 sQ\u0304 )\u03b1 |KLihKL|x\u03b2 |\u03a6i i h\u03a6f |x\u03b2 |KLihKL|(sQ \u2212 sQ\u0304 )\u03b1 |\u03a6i i\nME1M1 = i\nh\u03c0 0 |E\u03b1a B\u03b2a |0i, (12)\n+\n6mQ\nEi \u2212 EKL\nEi \u2212 EKL\nKL\n\nwhere mQ is the heavy quark mass, sQ (sQ\u0304 ) is the spin of the heavy quark (antiquark), K, L are the principal\nquantum number and the orbital angular momentum of the intermediate state, and Ei and EKL are the energy\neigenvalues of the initial state and the intermediate state, respectively.\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\nFor the process (1), the initial-state quarkonium \u03a6i = \u03c8 \u2032 , i.e., a20 = cos \u03b8, a12 = sin \u03b8, and other ani li vanish.\nSince the mass of the final-state quarkonium \u03a6f = \u03c8(11 P1 ) is supposed to be close to Mc.o.g = 3525.3 MeV [10]\nwhich is not close to Eth = 3729.0 \u00b1 1.0 MeV, we expect that the state mixing effect in \u03c8(11 P1 ) is small. So\n(f )\n(f )\nthat we take a11 = 1 and other anf lf vanish. The matrix element h\u03c0 0 |E\u03b1a B\u03b2a |0i can be evaluated by using the\nGross-Treiman-Wilczek formula [16]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n4\u03c0 2 md \u2212 mu\n1\n2 a a\n2 a\nE\u03b1 B\u03b2 |0i = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 h\u03c0 0 |gE\nh\u03c0 0 |gE\nf\u03c0 m2\u03c0 ,\n(13)\nE * Ba |0i = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u221a\n3\n3\n2 md + mu\nwhere we have identified gE as the QCD coupling constant gs as in Ref.

[7], when evaluating the transition amplitude, we describe the intermediate states by the string\nvibrational states proposed in Ref. [17]. Then for a given potential model, the radial wave functions and the\n\n3\n\n\fLP P\n\noverlapping integrals fni liinfflf can be calculated numerically.

From Eqs.(17) and (18), we see that the state-mixing effect significantly reduces the rate due to the\n110\n201\n110\n001\nfact that the sign of (f1211\n+ f1211\n) is opposite to that of (f2011\n+ f2011\n).\nThe detection of the process (1) depends on the capability of the photon detector. In the two-body decay (1),\n2\n2\n2\n2\nthe energies of \u03c8(11 P1 ) and \u03c0 0 are fixed, i.e., E\u03c8(11 P1 ) = (M\u03c82 \u2032 +M\u03c8(1\n1 P ) \u2212m\u03c0 0 )/(2M\u03c8 \u2032 ), E\u03c0 0 = (M\u03c8 \u2032 \u2212M\u03c8(11 P ) +\n1\n1\nm2\u03c00 )/(2M\u03c8\u2032 ). \u03c0 0 decays 99% into two photons. The two photons in \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 ) + \u03b3 + \u03b3 with invariant mass\n2\nM\u03b3\u03b3\n= m2\u03c00 comes mainly from the \u03c0 0 decay in (1) 4 since the branching ratios of the cascade electromagnetic\ntransitions \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7c\u2032 (3590)+ \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 and \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(13 P2 )+ \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )+ \u03b3 + \u03b3 are of the order of 10\u22125\nand 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22125 , respectively [18]. If the momenta of the two photons can be measured with sufficient accuracy,\none can look for the monotonic invariant mass M\u03b3\u03b3 as the signal. Once the energies \u03c91 and \u03c92 of the two photons\n2\n2\nare measured, the mass M\u03c8(11 P1 ) can be determined from \u03c91 + \u03c92 = E\u03c00 = (M\u03c82 \u2032 \u2212 M\u03c8(1\n1 P ) + m\u03c0 0 )/(2M\u03c8 \u2032 ).\n1\nNow BES has already accumulated 3 \u00d7 106 \u03c8 \u2032 events. According to the branching ratio in (18) and taking into\naccount a 10% detection efficiency, there can be 102 \u2212 103 events of \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 ) + \u03b3 + \u03b3. Unfortunately, the\npresent BES photon detector is not efficient enough to do this kind of measurement. So one should take certain\ndecay products of \u03c8(11 P1 ) as the signal.\nTo calculate the branching ratios of various \u03c8(11 P1 ) decay channels, the crucial thing is to estimate the radiative\ndecay rate \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) and the hadronic decay rate \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons). Since state-mixing effect\nis supposed to be not important for \u03c8(11 P1 ), we can simply do the single-channel calculation. In a recent paper\n[19], the rate \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) was estimated by using the spin symmetry\n1\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(1 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) =\n\n\u0012\n\n(11 P 1) \u00133\n\nE\u03b3\n\n(13 PJ )\n\nE\u03b3\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(13 PJ ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3)\n\n(19)\n\nand the experimental data of \u0393(\u03c8(13 PJ ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3). The obtained value is [19]\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) = 0.45 MeV.\n\n(20)\n\nFor \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons), we take the following approximation as in Ref. [9]:\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons)\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 3g)\n\u2248\n.\n\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 light hadrons)\n\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g)\n\n(21)\n\nThe rate \u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g) can be obtained from [9]\n\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g) = [1 \u2212 (2 + R)B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )]\u0393tot (J/\u03c8),\n\n(22)\n\n4\nThe branching ratio of the process \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03c0 0 is (9.7 \u00b1 2.1) \u00d7 10\u22124 [10], so that this process can also be detected.\nHowever, it can be clearly distinguished from the signal process (1) by the measured value of \u03c91 + \u03c92 = E\u03c00 since MJ/\u03c8\nand M\u03c8(11 P1 ) are quite different.\n\n4\n\n\fwhere R = Nc (4/9 + 1/9 + 1/9) = 2. Taking the updated data \u0393tot (J/\u03c8) = 87 \u00b1 5 keV, B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) =\n(5.93 \u00b1 0.10)% [10], we obtain\n\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g) = (66 \u00b1 4) keV.\n\n(23)\n\nWe first take the conventional perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach to calculate the ratio in Eq.(21), in\nwhich it is assumed that the long-distance effect is factorized into the wave function of the quarkonium (naive\nfactorization). The leading order PQCD formula for the right-hand side of Eq.(21) has been given in Refs. [20,21].\nIn the Chen-Kuang potential model, the ratio on the right-hand side of Eq.(21) has been calculated in Ref. [22],\nwhich is 0.515. Thus we obtain\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 3g) = (45 \u00b1 3) keV.\n\n(24)\n\nThen from Eqs.(20), (24) and some \u03c8(11 P1 ) decay modes with small decay rates given in Ref. [22], we obtain, in\nPQCD,\nPQCD :\n\n\u0393tot (\u03c8(11 P1 )) = (0.51 \u00b1 0.01) MeV,\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) \u2248 (88 \u00b1 2)%,\n\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons) \u2248 (8.8 \u00b1 0.8)%.\n\n(25)\n\nWe see that both \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3 and \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons are detectable, and the most promising mode\nis the radiative transition \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3.\nNext we take the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach developed in recent years [23]. NRQCD is a more\nsophisticated approach in which the naive factorization assumption is avoided. It has been intensively studied in\nrecent years and has been applied to studying the hadronic decays of heavy quarkonia [23,24,19,25]. The study\nis up to next-to-leading order (NLO) which contains unknown matrix elements of some operators5 . Considering\nthe large theoretical uncertainty and the large experimental errors in the input data in this study, taking the\nleading order (LO) NRQCD result concerning only one matrix element related to the wave function at the origin\nis already sufficient for the present purpose. The LO NRQCD result of \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons is [23]\nNRQCD :\n\n\u0393[\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons] = (0.53 \u00b1 0.08) MeV.\n\n(26)\n\nThis is very different from the corresponding values in Eq.(24) in the conventional PQCD approach. With the\nupdated value of \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3 [cf. Eq.(20)], the NRQCD predicted total width of \u03c8(11 P1 ) will be slightly\nlarger than that given in Ref. [23], which is\nNRQCD :\n\n\u0393tot (\u03c8(11 P1 ) = (1.1 \u00b1 0.09) MeV.\n\n(27)\n\nThen we have\nNRQCD :\n\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3) = (41 \u00b1 3)%,\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons) = (48 \u00b1 7)%.\n\n(28)\n\nWe see that the predictions in [cf. Eqs.(28)] are quite different from those of PQCD [cf. Eqs.(25)]. Again, both\n\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3 and \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons modes are detectable, but here \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons is\nslightly more promising.\nLet us first consider the mode \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3. We then need to take certain detectable decay channels of \u03b7c\nas the signal. Possible modes are \u03b7c \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0, \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, and \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 . The branching ratios are [10]\n\n5\n\nIn a recent paper [19], the NLO value \u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 )) \u2192 light hadrons = (0.72\u00b10.32) MeV is obtained. It is larger than the\nleading order value [cf. Eq.(26)] by 26% which is within the uncertainty (44%) of the NLO result, and may be neglected\nrelative to the large theoretical uncertainty and the large experimental errors in the input data in this study. Furthermore,\nthe uncertainty in this NLO result is so large that, together with the experimental errors in the input data, it can hardly\nmake clear predictions for the final results.\n\n5\n\n\fB(\u03b7c \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0) = (5.5 \u00b1 1.7)%,\nB(\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1) = (2.6 \u00b1 0.9)%,\n\nB(\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (2.0+0.7\n\u22120.6 )%.\n\n(29)\n\nThus we can look for the decay chains\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3,\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3,\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b7c \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3.\n\n(30)\n\nIf BES can accumulate 3 \u00d7 107 \u03c8 \u2032 events in the near future, then from Eqs.(18), (25) and (29), and taking\ninto account a 10% detection efficiency, we obtain the event numbers of the signals in (30) in the Chen-Kuang\npotential model for \u03b8 = \u221212\u25e6 . The results are listed in Table I. The corresponding event numbers in the NRQCD\napproach from Eqs.(18), (28), and (29) are listed in Table II. We see that the signals are detectable.\nNext we consider the mode \u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 light hadrons. We need to look at \u03c8(11 P1 ) decaying into a certain\nexclusive hadronic channel h. As in Ref. [9,22], we assume that\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 h)\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 3g)\n\u2248\n,\n\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 h)\n\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 2g)\n\n(31)\n\nand we can estimate \u03b7c \u2192 h from Eq.(23).\nFirst, in the conventional PQCD, we have [20]\n27\u03c0\n\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 2g)\n=\n\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g)\n5(\u03c0 2 \u2212 9)\u03b1s\n\n\u0012\n\n2\nMJ/\u03c8\n\nM\u03b72c\n\n\u0013\n,\n\n(32)\n\nwhich is model-independent. Then from Eq.(23) we have\n\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 2g) = (6.4 \u00b1 0.4) MeV,\n\n(33)\n\nin which we have taken \u03b1s (M\u03b7c ) \u2248 0.22, MJ/\u03c8 = 3096.87 \u00b1 0.04 MeV, M\u03b7c = 2978.8 \u00b1 1.8 MeV [10]. So, with\nEq.(24), we have\nPQCD :\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 h) = (0.010 \u00b1 0.001)\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 h).\n\n(34)\n\nNext, for NRQCD. to LO, the ratio \u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 2g)/\u0393(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g) is the same as Eq.(32) [23]. So that we still\nhave Eq.(33). Then from Eqs.(33) and (26), we have\nNRQCD :\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 h) = (0.083 \u00b1 0.018)\u0393(\u03b7c \u2192 h).\n\n(35)\n\nWith the experimental value \u0393tot (\u03b7c ) = 13.2+3.8\n\u22123.2 MeV [10], we have\nPQCD :\n\nNRQCD :\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0) = (7.3 \u00b1 3.0) keV,\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1) = (3.4 \u00b1 1.5) keV,\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (2.6 \u00b1 1.1) keV,\n\n(36)\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (22 \u00b1 12) keV.\n\n(37)\n\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0) = (60 \u00b1 32) keV,\n\u0393(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1) = (28 \u00b1 16) keV,\n\nThen with Eqs.(25) and (26) we have\nPQCD :\n\nNRQCD :\n\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0) = (1.4 \u00b1 0.9)%,\n\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1) = (0.67 \u00b1 0.43)%,\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (0.51 \u00b1 0.32)%,\n\n(38)\n\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 ) = (2.0 \u00b1 1.2)%.\n\n(39)\n\n1\n\nB(\u03c8(1 P1 ) \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0) = (5.5 \u00b1 3.3)%,\nB(\u03c8(11 P1 ) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1) = (2.6 \u00b1 1.7)%,\n\n6\n\n\fNow, instead of looking for the chains in (30), one can look for\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 K K\u0304\u03c0\u03b3\u03b3,\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b3,\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c8(11 P1 )\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3.\n\n(40)\n\nTaking into account a 10% detection efficiency, the numbers of events for the chains in Eqs.(40) with 3 \u00d7 107 \u03c8 \u2032\nevents in the Chen-Kuang potential model for \u03b8 = \u221212\u25e6 are listed in Table III (PQCD) and Table IV (NRQCD).\nWe see that the two decay chains are all detectable, and the chains (30) are more promising in the PQCD\napproach, while the chains (40) are more promising in the NRQCD approach.\nComparing the numbers in Table I\u2212 Table IV, we see that the NRQCD approach reduces the numbers of\nevents for the chains (30) by roughly a factor of 2, and increases the numbers of events for the chains (40) by\nroughly a factor of 4 relative to the conventional PQCD approach.\nThe above situation shows that the detection of the chains (30) and (40) is interesting not only for the \u03c8(11 P1 )\nsearches at BEPC, but also for providing a test of the difference between the NRQCD predictions and the\nconventional PQCD predictions.\nIn conclusion, our calculation shows that the S \u2212D mixing effect does affect the transition rate (1) significantly.\nIt reduces the rate (branching ration) by about a factor of 3 relative to the single-channel result [cf. Eqs.(17)\nand (18)]. If the photon detector in the future BES III can be efficient enough to measure the momenta of the\ntwo photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, the search for the \u03c8(11 P1 ) state via the process (1) will not be difficult at BEPC\nII. At the present BES, one should tag \u03c8(11 P1 ) directly via its decay products. Our results in Table I\u2212Table IV\nshow that the search for \u03c8(11 P1 ) is possible with the present BES if an accumulation of 3 \u00d7 107 \u03c8 \u2032 events can be\nachieved in the near future.\nFinally, we would like to mention that we have also calculated the rate of \u03c8(3770) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0 in the Chen-Kuang\npotential model for \u03b8 = \u221212\u25e6 and \u039bMS = 200 MeV. The result is \u0393(\u03c8(3770) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0) = 170 keV (for c2 =\n3c1 ), or 37 keV (for c2 = c1 ). This is close to the corresponding values \u0393(\u03c8(3770) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0\u03c0) = 160 keV (for c2 =\n3c1 ), or 30 keV (for c2 = c1 ) in the Cornell potential model [13]. Together with the results in Eqs.(17) and (3),\nwe see that the results are insensitive to the potential models used in the calculation as compared with the\nuncertainties in the approach.\nI would like to thank Hui Li and Zhi-Tong Yang for participating the calculation.
