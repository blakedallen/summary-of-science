A polynomial time algorithm\nis presented for checking whether a toric ideal of fixed codimension is normal.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet A be a nonnegative integer d \u00d7 n matrix of rank d, C(A) the cone in Rd\nspanned by the columns of A, and IA the toric ideal associated to A as in [14].\nThe codimension of IA is n \u2212 d. If the columns of A form a Hilbert basis,\ni.e. C(A) \u2229 ZA = NA, then A and IA are called normal. Our main result is\nTheorem 1 Every normal toric ideal IA of codimension 2 has a squarefree initial ideal, and the corresponding reduced Gr\u00f6bner basis minimally generates IA .\nIn Section 2 we introduce the necessary tools and prove Theorem 1 in the\ncase of complete intersections. In Section 3 we complete the proof in the case\nof codimension two normal toric ideals which are not complete intersections.\nSection 4 deals with detecting normality and we prove the following result.\nTheorem 2 If codim(IA ) = n\u2212d is fixed, then there is an algorithm to decide\nwhether A is normal whose running time is polynomial in n and the bitsize of A.\nIn other words, if n \u2212 d is fixed then one can decide in polynomial time\nwhether n vectors in Zd form a Hilbert basis of the cone these vectors generate. This answers a question raised by Alexander Barvinok at Snowbird (June\n2006). We recently found out that Theorem 2 has been proved independently\nby F. Eisenbrand, A. Seb\u00f6, and G. Shmonin [3]. The authors had announced\nthe result at the 12th Combinatorial Optimization Workshop held in Aussois,\nFrance in January 2008. For recent advances on related complexity questions\nconcerning lattice points in polyhedra of fixed dimension or codimension we\nrefer to the article [4].\nThis work is motivated both by questions that are intrinsic to combinatorial\ncommutative algebra and by applications to statistics and optimization. In the\nformer domain, a longstanding conjecture states that every Cohen-Macaulay\ntoric ideal IA has a monomial initial ideal that is also Cohen-Macaulay. This\nholds for toric ideals up to dimension 3 (see [7]), and O'Shea and Thomas\n\n1\n\n\fproved it for \u2206-normal configurations [10]. Theorem 1 offers supporting evidence because normal toric ideals and their square-free initial ideals are both\nCohen-Macaulay.\nIn algebraic statistics, our result ensures that the sequential importance sampling scheme of Chen, Dinwoodie and Sullivant [2] is applicable to exponential\nfamilies with few states. In integer programming, it ensures that, for suitably\nchosen cost functions, every matrix of corank 2 specifies a Gomory family [7].\nFinally, in algebraic geometry, where the definition of toric varieties [5] requires\nthem to be normal, Theorem 1 states that every toric variety of codimension 2\nadmits a Gr\u00f6bner degeneration to a reduced union of coordinate subspaces.\n\n2\n\nComplete Intersections\n\nThe aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1 in the case when IA is a complete intersection. Before we approach this proof we will prove an alternative\ncharacterization of normality due to Seb\u00f6 [12]. We include a proof of this result.\nProposition 3 An integer matrix A = [a1 , . . . , an ] is normal if and only if for\neach x \u2208 ker(A) there exists an integer vector y \u2208 ker(A) such that y \u2264 \u2308x\u2309.\nProof. (=\u21d2) Suppose A is normal, and x \u2208 ker A. We have x1 a1 + * * * + xn an =\n0. The vector z = \u2308x1 \u2309 * a1 + * * * + \u2308xn \u2309 * an lies in the lattice ZA, and as\nz = (\u2308x1 \u2309 \u2212 x1 ) * a1 + * * * + (\u2308xn \u2309 \u2212 xn ) * an , it also lies in the cone C(A).\nSince A is normal, we conclude that z is in the semigroup NA. We can write\nz = m1 a1 + * * * + mn an with m1 , . . . , mn nonnegative integers. The vector y\nwith coordinates yi = \u2308xi \u2309 \u2212 mi lies in ker(A) and satisfies y \u2264 \u2308x\u2309.\n(\u21d0=) Now suppose that for each x \u2208 ker(A) there is an integral y \u2208 ker(A)\nwith y \u2264 \u2308x\u2309. Let z \u2208 C(A) \u2229 Zd . This means that z = r1 a1 + . . . + rn an with\nri \u2208 R\u22650 and z = m1 a1 + . . . + mn an with mi \u2208 Z. Combining these we obtain:\n(m1 \u2212 r1 ) * a1 + * * * + (mn \u2212 rn ) * an = 0.\nBy hypothesis we may pick an integral y \u2208 ker(A) with yi \u2264 \u2308mi \u2212 ri \u2309 Then\nz = (m1 \u2212 y1 ) * a1 + * * * + (mn \u2212 yn ) * an\ngives a nonnegative integral representation of z in terms of columns of A, since\nmi \u2212 yi \u2265 0 for all i. We conclude that z \u2208 NA, and hence A is normal.\n\u2737\nOur main tool in what follows is the Gale diagram of a vector configuration.\nLet A be a integer d \u00d7 n matrix whose column vectors span Rd . We choose a\nmatrix B whose rows form a lattice basis of ker(A) \u2229 Zn . The set of column\nvectors of B is said to be a Gale diagram [15] of A. Normality of IA is encoded\nin both A and in ker(A) = im(B), by Proposition 3, and hence also in B.\nHochster [6] proved that a normal toric ideal is Cohen-Macaulay. Thus\na codimension two normal toric ideal has a minimal free resolution of length\ntwo. Peeva and Sturmfels [11] characterized Cohen-Macaulay codimension two\nlattice ideals. In this paper we consider saturated lattices whose lattice ideal is\n\n2\n\n\fC\nD\n\nE\n\n\u273b\n\n\u2745\n\u25a0\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u271b\n\nB\n\u2712\n\u2732\n\nA\n\n\u2744\n\nF\nA B C D E F\np\u2212q = + + 0 \u2212 \u2212 0\nr\u2212s = 0 + + + 0 \u2212\nFigure 1: The imbalanced Gale diagram of a complete intersection.\na toric ideal. For the remainder of this paper we assume that IA is normal, or\nequivalently that A is a Hilbert basis of the cone C(A). We assume that the\ncone C(A) is pointed and hence IA is homogeneous in some positive grading.\nThe following result gives a supply of squarefree monomial terms of the\nbinomial generators of IA . This result has been proven in [13, Proposition 4.1]\nand [9, Lemma 6.1], and we have also learned it from Winfried Bruns [1].\nProposition 4 Suppose A is normal. Then each minimal binomial generator\nof the toric ideal IA has at least one squarefree term.\nThis implies that the conclusion of Theorem 1 holds when codim(IA ) = 1.\nIn that case, IA is a principal ideal and the unique binomial generator of IA is\na Gr\u00f6bner basis with its squarefree term being the leading monomial.\nIn view of Proposition 4 our approach is to show the existence of a term\norder selecting the squarefree terms as initial terms. The Gale diagram gives\ninformation toward this goal. The following result is [11, Proposition 4.1].\nProposition 5 If codim(IA ) = 2 then the following are equivalent:\n(i) The toric ideal IA is not Cohen-Macaulay.\n(ii) The toric ideal IA has at least four minimal generators.\n(iii) The matrix A has a Gale diagram B which intersects each of the four open\nquadrants in R2 . Here the matrix B is identified with its set of columns.\nWe now assume that\nIA is normal of codimension 2 and B is any Gale\n\b\ndiagram. Then B = (B1j , B2j ) : j = 1, . . . , n intersects at most three open\nquadrants, and that any minimal generating set of IA has two or three elements.\n\n3\n\n\fIn this section we examine the first case, where IA = hxp \u2212 xq , xr \u2212 xs i is a\ncomplete intersection, and B is the 2 \u00d7 n matrix whose rows are p \u2212 q and r \u2212 s.\nThe Gale diagram B is called imbalanced if either B1j = 0 or B2j \u2265 0 for all j.\nLemma 6 [11, Theorem 3.9] A codimension 2 toric ideal IA is a complete\nintersection if and only if there exists an imbalanced Gale diagram B.\nIn the light of this lemma, we can represent a complete intersection by an\nimbalanced Gale diagram as depicted in Figure 1. The arrows represent a sign\nclass of columns of B and not just an individual vector. For instance the class\nlabeled D in Figure 1 consists of all column vectors with B1j < 0 and B2j > 0.\nProof of Theorem 1 for complete intersections: By Proposition 4 both generators g1 = xp \u2212 xq and g2 = xr \u2212 xs have a squarefree term. The class of vectors\nF must exist in the Gale diagram since otherwise C(A) would not be pointed.\nIf the term xs corresponding to F is squarefree then we can use any term\norder so that xs is the initial term of g2 and the squarefree term of g1 is its\ninitial term. Then g1 and g2 forms the Gr\u00f6bner basis of IA because their initial\nterms are relatively prime. This Gr\u00f6bner basis is or can be made reduced.\nSuppose that xs is not squarefree. Then \u2212B2j = f \u2265 2 for some j \u2208 F , and\nB2j = 1 for j \u2208 B \u222a C \u222a D. Without loss of generality we assume that xp is the\nsquarefree term of g1 , so that B1j = 1 for j \u2208 A \u222a B. We choose representatives\nfrom the D and E classes, labeling them \u2212d and \u2212e where d, e \u2265 1:\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\np \u2212 q = 1 . . . 1 . . . 0 . . . \u2212d . . . \u2212e . . . 0\nr \u2212 s = 0 . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 0 . . . \u2212f\nNow we consider u = \u2212 21 (p \u2212 q) + 12 (r \u2212 s) \u2208 ker(A) and we round it up to get\nA\n\u2308u\u2309 =\n\nB\n\nC\n\n0 ... 0 ... 1 ...\n\nD\n\u0006 d+1 \u0007\n2\n\n...\n\nE\n\u0006e\u0007\n2\n\nlF m\n. . . \u2212 f2\n\nNote that \u2212f /2 \u2264 \u22121. By Proposition 3 there exists an integral v \u2208 ker(A)\nwith v \u2264 \u2308u\u2309. This vector is an integral combination v = \u03b1(p \u2212 q) + \u03b2(r \u2212 s).\nIf v1 = 0 then \u03b1 = 0 and v must be a positive multiple of (r \u2212 s) to ensure\nthat vF = \u2212\u03b2f \u2264 \u2308\u2212f /2\u2309 \u2264 \u22121. This implies the contradiction vB = \u03b2 > 0.\nNext suppose that v1 \u2264 \u22121. Then \u03b1 \u2264 \u22121 (considering the A component)\nand \u03b2 \u2265 1 (considering\n\u0007 F component). The D representative requires that\n\u0006 the\nd + 1 \u2264 \u2212\u03b1d + \u03b2 \u2264 d+1\n2 . But this implies that d = 0, a contradiction. We\nconclude that the D class is not present in the Gale diagram. By rotating\nthe diagram by 90 degrees counterclockwise we can assume that we have an\nimbalanced Gale diagram where the B class is missing. For the two new minimal\ngenerators xp \u2212 xq and xr \u2212 xs we are either in the first case analyzed above\n(i.e. xs and xp are squarefree and relatively prime) or in the second case where\nxp and xr are squarefree and relatively prime, as these do not contain any B\nvariable.

More precisely, using the\ntwo syzygy triangles in Figure 3 and Figure 4 we find that this matrix equals\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nAB1 D \u2217 E \u2217 F1\u2217\n\uf8f0B2 CD\nF2\u2217 G\u2217 \uf8fb\nF1 F2\nB1\u2217 B2\u2217\n\n5\n\n\fC\nD\nE\nF1\n\nB2\n\u2701\u2715\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\u272f\n\u2701\u271f\u271f\u271f\n\u271f\n\u2701\n\u2709\n\n\u273b\n\n\u2745\n\u25a0\n\u2745\n\u271b \u2745\n\u271f\u2709\n\u271f\n\u2745\n(1, 1)\n\u271f\n\u2719\n\u271f\n(0, 1) \u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n(1, 0)\u2745\u2745\u2709\n\u2732\n\u2701\n\u2701\n\u2701\u261b\u2701\n\u2744\n\nF2\n\nB1\n\nA\n\nG\n\nFigure 4: Another syzygy triangle as in [11]\nIn the above matrix the letters represent classes of variables corresponding\nto the classes of vectors in the Gale diagram. Products of letters correspond to\nmonomials in these classes of variables. The letters with an asterisk correspond\nto the same class as those without an asterisk, but they might have different\nexponent vectors (since they come from different syzygy triangles). The first\ncolumn of the matrix corresponds to the first triangle and the second column\nto the second triangle. Moreover, by the Hilbert-Burch Theorem, the three\n2\u00d72-minors of this matrix are precisely the minimal generators of IA :\nAB1 F2\u2217 G\u2217 \u2212 B2 CDD \u2217 E \u2217 F1\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nAB1 B1\u2217 B2\u2217 \u2212 D \u2217 E \u2217 F1 F1\u2217 F2\nB1\u2217 B2 B2\u2217 CD \u2212 F1 F2 F2\u2217 G\u2217\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThe next result completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nLemma 7 There exists a term order such that the binomial generators (1),(2),(3)\nof the toric ideal IA form a Gr\u00f6bner basis with squarefree initial monomials.\nProof. We have a few cases to consider. First, either the D class exists or it\ndoes not. If it exists then the monomial DD \u2217 is not squarefree and hence the\nsquarefree term of (1) is the first term. Note that the first terms of (2) and\n(3) cannot be squarefree simultaneously: if they were, the B1 and B2 vectors\ncannot be present in the Gale diagram, and this would be an imbalanced Gale\ndiagram. Similarly, the second terms of these binomials cannot be squarefree\nsimultaneously. This gives two cases to consider. In the first case we have\nAG\u2217 \u2212 B2 CDD \u2217 E \u2217 F1\u2217 , AB2\u2217 \u2212 D \u2217 E \u2217 F1 F1\u2217 , B2 B2\u2217 CD \u2212 F1 G\u2217 .\n\n6\n\n(4)\n\n\fHere B1 and F2 are absent because otherwise B1 B1\u2217 and F2 F2\u2217 are not squarefree.\nIf we choose a lexicographic term order where A > G > {B2 , C, D, E, F1 }\nthen the underlined terms are the leading terms in (4). The S-pair S(1, 2) =\nD \u2217 E \u2217 F1 F1\u2217 G\u2217 \u2212 B2 B2\u2217 CDD \u2217 E \u2217 F1\u2217 is reduced to zero by the third binomial, and\nthe S-pair S(1, 3) = AB2 B2\u2217 CD \u2212 B2 CDD \u2217 E \u2217 F1 F1\u2217 is reduced to zero by the\nsecond binomial. The S-pair S(2, 3) reduces to zero since the leading terms AB2\u2217\nand F1 G\u2217 are relatively prime, and hence (4) is a squarefree Gr\u00f6bner basis.\nIn the second case, the minimal generators and their squarefree terms are\nAB1 F2\u2217 G\u2217 \u2212 CDD \u2217 E \u2217 , AB1 B1\u2217 \u2212 D \u2217 E \u2217 F2 , B1\u2217 CD \u2212 F2 F2\u2217 G\u2217 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe product of the three underlined terms is equal to the product of the three\nnon-underlined terms. Hence no term order selects the underlined terms as\nleading terms. However, the squarefreeness of these three monomials implies\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n0\n\u22121\nA=\n, B1 =\n,C=\n,D=\n,\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\nE=\n, F2 =\n, G=\n.\n0\n\u22121\n\u22121\nFrom the diagonal edge in the two syzygy triangles we see that B1 = F2\u2217 = 1.\nThis means that the non-underlined terms of the second and third binomials in\n(5) are actually squarefree, and we are back in the previous case (4).\nNow suppose that the D vectors are not present in the Gale diagram depicted\nin Figure 2. Then the binomial generators (1), (2) and (3) have the form\nAB1 F2\u2217 G\u2217 \u2212 B2 CE \u2217 F1\u2217 , AB1 B1\u2217 B2\u2217 \u2212 E \u2217 F1 F1\u2217 F2 , B1\u2217 B2 B2\u2217 C \u2212 F1 F2 F2\u2217 G\u2217 .\nIf in the first binomial the first term is squarefree we are back to (4) or (5). If the\nsecond term is squarefree, then we rotate the Gale diagram 180 degrees. This\nleads to the same binomials but now with the first term of the first binomial\nsquarefree. Once again we are back to (4) or (5). This concludes the proof. \u2737\n\n4\n\nChecking Normality\n\nIn this section we assume that the codimension m = n \u2212 d of IA is fixed. First\nwe reformulate Proposition 3. Let z be an integral vector in ker(A). We define\n\b\nPz = x \u2208 ker(A) : \u2308xi \u2309 \u2265 zi for i = 1, . . . , n .\n\nSince Pz = {x \u2208 ker(A) : xi > zi \u2212 1 i = 1, . . . , n} and since we assume that\nthe cone C(A) is pointed, Pz is a relatively open polytope in ker(A) \u2243 Rm .\nRemark 8 If u and z are lattice vectors in ker(A) then Pu+z = z + Pu .\n\nNow let B be an n \u00d7 m matrix whose columns form a lattice basis of ker(A),\nand let bi be the rows of B. Then Pz is affinely isomorphic to Qv = {y \u2208 Rm :\nbi * y > bi * v \u2212 1, i = 1, . . . , n} where v is the unique lattice point in Zm such\nthat Bv = z. Remark 8 implies that for two lattice points v and w in Zm we\nhave Qv+w = w + Qv . Note that Q0 = {y \u2208 Rm : bi * y > \u22121, i = 1, . . . , n}.\nWe now see that the following is equivalent to Proposition 3.\n\n7\n\n\fTheorem 9 The toric ideal IA is normal if and only if Q0 + Zm = Rm .\nGiven any polytope Q = {y \u2208 Rm : Cy \u2265 d} of dimension m the smallest\npositive real number t such that tQ + Zm = Rm is called the covering radius\nof Q. If Q is a rational polytope it is known that the covering radius of Q is a\nrational number with a bit-size that is a polynomial in the bit-size of C and d.\nCorollary 10 The toric ideal IA is normal if and only if the covering radius\nof Q\u03040 , the closure of the polytope Q0 , is less than 1.\nProof of Theorem 2: Ravi Kannan [8, Section 5] has shown that, for fixed m,\nand given a rational m-dimensional polytope Q = {y \u2208 Rm : Cy \u2265 d} where\nC \u2208 Zn\u00d7m and d \u2208 Zn , there exists an algorithm to find the covering radius\nof Q with runtime a polynomial in n and the bit-size of C and the vector d.\nSince one can compute a B whose bit-size is a polynomial in the bit-size of A\nin polynomial time, the above corollary implies the result.\n\u2737\nAcknowledgement: B.
