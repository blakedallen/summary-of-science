Among the early examples of such a generalization is Pauli's\nattempts to formulate a quantum mechanical theory based on a vector space with an indefinite inner product [1]. This was originally motivated by Dirac's observation that such theories\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: amostafazadeh@ku.edu.tr\n\n1\n\n\fwould ease handling the infinities arising in quantum electrodynamics [2]. QM with an indefinite metric has been thoroughly studied in the 1960s [3]. Another more recent attempt at a\ngeneralization of QM is so-called P T -Symmetric QM [4].\nThe interest in P T -symmetric QM relies on an appealing idea due to Bender and a set of\nrather surprising spectral properties of certain non-Hermitian but P T -symmetric Hamiltonians of the standard form: H = p2 + V (x).1 Bender's idea concerned the possibility that one\nmight be able to generalize the standard local quantum field theory by replacing the postulate of the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian by the supposedly more general requirement of its\nCP T -symmetry. (0 + 1)-dimensional examples of such a field theory are provided by the P T symmetric QM in which one allows the Hamiltonian to be non-Hermitian but requires that it\ncommutes with P T . The study of P T -symmetric quantum systems gained some valid ground\nonce it became clear that the spectrum of some simple P T -symmetric Hamiltonians, such as\nH = p2 + ix3 , was entirely real and positive, [5].\nDuring the past seven years, there have appeared dozens of publications on P T -symmetric\nQM. Most of these examined specific toy models [6], but some attempted to address the more\nfundamental issues such as that of the nature of the space of state vectors [7] \u2013 [15]. Among the\nlatter is a series of articles [8] \u2013 [15] by the present author that aim at providing a mathematically\nsound framework for describing P T -symmetric QM and its physical interpretation [16]. The\nresults reported in these articles stem from the rather simple observation that, similarly to the\nHermitian Hamiltonians, the P T -symmetric Hamiltonians constitute a subclass of the so-called\npseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The latter are linear operators H acting in a Hilbert space\nH\u2032 - which is generally different from the physical Hilbert space - and satisfying\nH \u2020 = \u03b7H\u03b7 \u22121\n\n(1)\n\nfor some invertible Hermitian operator \u03b7 : H\u2032 \u2192 H\u2032 . Here H \u2020 denotes the adjoint of H defined\nusing the inner product h*, *i of the Hilbert space H\u2032 . The operator \u03b7 defines a possibly indefinite\ninner product, namely\nhh*, *ii\u03b7 := h*, \u03b7*i.\n(2)\nAs a consequence, it is sometimes called a 'metric operator'. The main property of (2) is that\nH is Hermitian with respect to this inner product, i.e., hh*, H*ii\u03b7 = hhH*, *ii\u03b7 .\nFor a given pseudo-Hermitian operator H, the metric operator \u03b7 is not unique. If a particular\nchoice for \u03b7 is made, then H is called \u03b7-pseudo-Hermitian. The standard P T -symmetric models\nstudied in the literature are P -pseudo-Hermitian [8]. See also [12, 17].\nIt turns out that, under quite general conditions, the pseudo-Hermiticity of H is equivalent to the existence of antilinear symmetries of H, P T -symmetry being the primary example\n[10, 18, 19]. Furthermore, pseudo-Hermiticity of H is equivalent to the condition that either the\nspectrum of H is real or its complex eigenvalues come in complex-conjugate pairs. The study\n1\n\nHere P and T are respectively the parity and time-reversal operators defined in the space of all complexvalued functions \u03c8 : R \u2192 C by (P \u03c8)(x) := \u03c8(\u2212x) and (T \u03c8)(x) := \u03c8(x)\u2217 . The letter relation defines T as an\nantilinear operator whose action should not be viewed as a change of sign of t.\n\n2\n\n\fof pseudo-Hermitian operators also provides a characterization of the non-Hermitian (diagonalizable) Hamiltonians that have a real spectrum. These correspond to the subclass of pseudoHermitian Hamiltonians that are \u03b7+ -pseudo-Hermitian with respect to some positive-definite2\nmetric operator \u03b7+ . In this case H is Hermitian with respect to a genuine positive-definite\ninner product3 , namely\nhh*, *ii\u03b7+ := h*, \u03b7+ *i.\n(3)\nIf H does not have a real spectrum or if it is not diagonalizable, the set of all metric operators \u03b7\nsatisfying (1) does not include any positive-definite elements and such a positive-definite inner\nproduct does not exist [13, 19].\nIt can also be shown that whenever H is a diagonalizable operator with a real spectrum,\nthen it can be mapped to a Hermitian operator via a similarity transformation [9], i.e., it is\nquasi-Hermitian [20]. Quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonians form a proper subset of pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonians which allow for the formulation of a probabilistic quantum theory. This is done\nby identifying the physical Hilbert space H with the (Cauchy completion [21] of the) span\nof the eigenvectors of H (i.e., the underlying vector space associated with the Hilbert space\nH\u2032 ) endowed with the inner product hh*, *ii\u03b7+ , [21, 22]. By construction, H will be a Hermitian (densely-defined) operator acting in H. Similarly the observables of the theory are the\nHermitian operators acting in H. For concrete examples see [16].\nThe reality of the spectrum of H is also equivalent to the presence of an exact antilinear\nsymmetry of the system. Therefore, a diagonalizable Hamiltonian having an exact antilinear\nsymmetry, e.g., P T -symmetry, is quasi-Hermitian. In particular, it may be mapped to a Hermitian Hamiltonian H \u2032 via a similarity transformation4 H \u2192 H \u2032 = UHU \u22121 where the operator\nU satisfies hh*, *ii\u03b7+ = hU*, U*i, i.e., U is a unitary operator mapping H onto H\u2032 . This shows\nthat indeed the quantum system defined by the Hamiltonian H and the Hilbert space H may\nas well be described by the Hermitian Hamiltonian H \u2032 and the original Hilbert space H\u2032 , [14].\nIn an attempt at devising a probabilistic interpretation for quantum systems with Hamiltonians having exact P T -symmetry, Bender and his collaborators have introduced a generic\nsymmetry of these Hamiltonians that they term as the 'charge-conjugation' symmetry [24].\nUsing the generator C of this symmetry, they were able to introduce a positive-definite inner\nproduct that they called the CP T -inner product. As shown in [15, 25] the CP T -inner product is just a particular example of the inner product (3) that was originally constructed in\nRefs. [9, 10, 11].\nThe description of the 'charge conjugation' operator C of the P T -symmetric QM [24]\nprovided by the theory of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians and the fact that general pseudoHermitian Hamiltonians have generic antilinear symmetries [10, 18, 19] raise the natural ques2\n\nA positive-definite operator is an invertible positive operator. Alternatively, it is a self-adjoint operator\nwith a strictly positive spectrum.\n3\nThe positive-definiteness of an inner product hh*, *ii means that hh\u03c8, \u03c8ii \u2208 R+ if and only if \u03c8 6= 0.\n4\nThis applies for the cases that H has time-independent eigenvectors. Throughout this article we will only\nconsider time-independent Hamiltonians.\n\n3\n\n\ftion whether one could associate to a general pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian a linear symmetry\ngenerator C and an antilinear symmetry generator PT that would respectively generalize C and\nP T . This question is answered in [15].5 It turns out that for a given diagonalizable pseudoHermitian Hamiltonian H one may introduce generalized parity (P), time-reversal (T ) and\ncharge-conjugation (C) operators and establish the PT -, C-, and CPT -symmetries of H, [15].\nIt must be noted that the use of the term 'charge-conjugation' in the above discussions solely\nrests on the fact that similarly to the ordinary charge-conjugation operator of relativistic QM,\nC is a Hermitian involution, i.e., C \u2020 = C = C \u22121 . It is important to note that because C is a\nlinear operator, it is actually a Z2 -grading operator for the Hilbert space [26].\nThe question whether C has anything to do with the well-known charge-conjugation operation of relativistic QM is the principal goal of the present paper. We will achieve this goal by\nconstructing a concrete realization of the abstract notions of generalized parity, time-reversal,\nand charge-conjugation operations for Klein-Gordon fields. This will in turn allow us to offer\nan application of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators in addressing one of the oldest\nproblems of modern physics concerning relativistic position operators and localized states [27].\nThe problem of constructing a consistent quantum mechanical formulation of Klein-Gordon\nfields has been the focus of attention since the early days of QM. There are numerous publications on the subject most of which are based on the restriction to positive-frequency fields\n[28, 29, 30]. A notable exception is a series of papers by Gitman and his collaborators [31, 32]\nwhich were brought to our attention while we were writing up the present paper.6 In [31, 32]\nthe authors base their investigation on a careful treatment of the underlying classical system\nand perform a constraint canonical quantization of this system. In particular, they identify a\ndiscrete classical degree of freedom \u03b6 which takes the values +1 and \u22121. Quantization of \u03b6\nleads to a quantum observable \u03b6\u0302 which satisfies \u03b6\u0302 2 = 1 and plays a key role in the approach\nof [31, 32]. We will elaborate on the relationship between this approach and ours in Section 4.\nHere we suffice to mention that \u03b6 arises in our treatment as the classical counterpart of the\ngeneralized charge-conjugation operator C.\nThe article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present a two-component formulation of the Klein-Gordon equation, establish the pseudo-Hermiticity and quasi-Hermiticity of\nthe corresponding two-component matrix Hamiltonian, construct a positive-definite metric operator and the corresponding inner product, discuss the relationship between the one- and\ntwo-component fields and review some of the relevant results reported in [34, 35]. In Section 3,\nwe compute P, T , and C for the two-component Klein-Gordon fields and elaborate on the PT -,\nC- and CPT -symmetries of the corresponding Hamiltonian. We then define and study generalized parity, time-reversal, and charge-conjugation operators for the ordinary single-component\nKlein-Gordon fields. In Section 4, we introduce and study position wave functions for the\nKlein-Gordon fields. In Section 5, we discuss the position and momentum operators and the\nrelativistic localized and coherent states. Finally in Section 6, we present a summary of our\n5\n6\n\nSee also [23] where the same question has been considered.\nSee also [33].\n\n4\n\n\fmain results and our concluding remarks.\nThroughout this article we shall use a unit system in which c = 1.\n\n2\n\nPseudo-Hermiticity and Klein-Gordon Fields\n\nConsider the Klein-Gordon equation\n[\u2202t2 \u2212 \u22072 + \u03bc2 ]\u03c8(t, ~x) = 0,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bc := m/~ and m is the mass of the field.

Then we can express (4) as a 'dynamical equation' in the\nHilbert space L2 (R3 ), namely\n[\u2202t2 + D]\u03c8(t) = 0,\n(5)\nwhere for all t \u2208 R the function \u03c8(t) : R3 \u2192 C, defined by \u03c8(t)(~x) := \u03c8(t, ~x), belongs to\nL2 (R3 ), and D : L2 (R3 ) \u2192 L2 (R3 ) is the Hermitian operator\n[D\u03c8(t)](~x) := [\u2212\u22072 + \u03bc2 ]\u03c8(t, ~x),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R, \u2200~x \u2208 R3 .\n\n(6)\n\nIt is well-known [36, 28, 29, 37] that one can express the Klein-Gordon equation (5) as the\ntwo-component Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\ni~\n\nd\n\u03a8(t) = H\u03a8(t),\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nwhere for all t \u2208 R\n\u03c8(t) + i\u03bb\u03c8\u0307(t)\n\u03c8(t) \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c8\u0307(t)\n\n\u03a8(t) :=\n~\nH :=\n2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\u03bbD + \u03bb\u22121\n\u03bbD \u2212 \u03bb\u22121\n\u2212\u03bbD + \u03bb\u22121 \u2212\u03bbD \u2212 \u03bb\u22121\n\n(8)\n!\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\na dot denotes a t-derivative, and \u03bb \u2208 R \u2212 {0} is an arbitrary constant having the dimension of\nlength.\nThe two-component vectors \u03a8(t) belong to\nH\u2032 := L2 (R3 ) \u2295 L2 (R3 ),\n\n(10)\n\nand the Hamiltonian H may be viewed as acting in H\u2032 . One can easily check that H is\nnot Hermitian with respect to the inner product of H\u2032 , but it satisfies H \u2020 = \u03c33 H\u03c33\u22121 , where\n!\n0\n\u03c33 := 10 \u22121\n, [28, 29]. Hence H is \u03c33 -pseudo-Hermitian [8]. Furthermore, because D is\npositive-definite, H is a diagonalizable operator with a real spectrum. This in turn implies\nthat it is quasi-Hermitian [9, 20]. According to [9], H is \u03b7+ -pseudo-Hermitian for a positivedefinite metric operator \u03b7+ . Equivalently, it is Hermitian with respect to the corresponding\npositive-definite inner product, namely (3). The construction of \u03b7+ requires the solution of the\neigenvalue problem for H and H \u2020 .\n5\n\n\fThe eigenvalues and a set of eigenvectors of H are given by\nE\u01eb,k := \u01eb ~ \u03c9k ,\n\u03a8\u01eb,~k :=\n\n1\n2\n\n(11)\n\nrk\u22121 + \u01ebrk\nrk\u22121 \u2212 \u01ebrk\n\n!\n\n\u03c6~k ,\n\n(12)\n\np\n\u221a\nwhere \u01eb = \u00b11, k := |~k|, ~k \u2208 R3 , \u03c9k := k 2 + \u03bc2 , rk := \u03bb \u03c9k , \u03c6~k are defined by \u03c6~k (~x) :=\n~\n(2\u03c0)\u22123/2 eik*~x = h~x|~ki, and h*|*i denotes the inner product of L2 (R3 ). The eigenvectors \u03a8\u01eb,~k\ntogether with\n!\nrk + \u01ebrk\u22121\n1\n\u03c6~k\n(13)\n\u03a6\u01eb,~k :=\n2\nrk \u2212 \u01ebrk\u22121\nform a complete biorthonormal system for the Hilbert space. This means that\nXZ\n3 ~\n\u2032\n~\nd3 k |\u03a8\u01eb,~k ih\u03a6\u01eb,~k | = 1,\nh\u03a8\u01eb,~k , \u03a6\u01eb\u2032 ,~k\u2032 i = \u03b4\u01eb,\u01eb\u2032 \u03b4 (k \u2212 k ),\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nwhere h*, *i stands for the inner product of H\u2032 , and for \u03be, \u03b6 \u2208 H\u2032 , |\u03beih\u03b6| is the operator defined\nby |\u03beih\u03b6|\u03c7 := h\u03b6, \u03c7i\u03be, for all \u03c7 \u2208 H\u2032 . Similarly, one can check that indeed \u03a6\u01eb,~k are eigenvectors\nof H \u2020 with the same eigenvalues, H \u2020 \u03a6\u01eb,~k = E\u01eb,k \u03a6\u01eb,~k , and that H has the following spectral\nresolution\nXZ\nH=\nd3 k E\u01eb,k |\u03a8\u01eb,~k ih\u03a6\u01eb,~k |.\n(14)\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nThe positive-definite metric operator associated with the choice {\u03a8\u01eb,~k , \u03a6\u01eb,~k } for a biorthonormal system for H\u2032 has the from [8, 11, 15, 34]\n!\n2\n\u22122\n2\n\u22122\nXZ\nX\n+\nX\nX\n\u2212\nX\n1\n: H\u2032 \u2192 H\u2032 ,\n(15)\n\u03b7+ =\nd3 k |\u03a6\u01eb,~k ih\u03a6\u01eb,~k | =\n2\n\u22122\n2\n\u22122\n2\n3\nX\n\u2212\nX\nX\n+\nX\nR\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nwhere\nX :=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb D 1/4 .\n\n(16)\n\nNote that here and throughout this paper we use the spectral resolution of D to define its\nR\npowers: D \u03bd := R3 d3 k (k 2 + \u03bc2 )\u03bd |~kih~k| for all \u03bd \u2208 R.\nHaving obtained the positive-definite metric operator \u03b7+ , we can compute the form of the\ncorresponding inner product. For all \u03be, \u03b6 \u2208 H\u2032 , let \u03be a , \u03b6 a \u2208 L2 (R3 ) be such that\n!\n!\n\u03b61\n\u03be1\n.\n(17)\n,\n\u03b6=\n\u03be=\n\u03b62\n\u03be2\nThen in view of (15),\nhh\u03be, \u03b6ii\u03b7+ =\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nh\u03be+ |X 2\u03b6+ i + h\u03be\u2212 |X \u22122 \u03b6\u2212 i ,\n2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have defined \u03be\u00b1 := \u03be 1 \u00b1 \u03be 2 and \u03b6\u00b1 := \u03b6 1 \u00b1 \u03b6 2 . If we view H\u2032 as a complex vector space\nand endow it with the inner product (18), we obtain a new inner product space whose Cauchy\ncompletion yields another Hilbert space which we denote by K.\n6\n\n\fNext, let D \u2282 L2 (R3 ) be the domain of the operator D, and V denote the complex vector\nspace of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation (5), namely\n\b\nV := \u03c8 : R \u2192 D | [\u2202t2 + D]\u03c8(t) = 0, \u2200t \u2208 R .\n(19)\nThen, for all t \u2208 R, one can use the map Ut : V \u2192 H\u2032 , defined by\n1\nUt \u03c8 := \u221a \u03a8(t),\n2 \u03bb\u03bc\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2208 V,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03a8(t) is given in (8), to endow V with the positive-definite inner product\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) := hhUt \u03c81 , Ut \u03c82 ii\u03b7+ = (4\u03bc\u03bb)\u22121hh\u03a81 (t), \u03a82 (t)ii\u03b7+ .\n\n(21)\n\nBecause \u03b7+ does not depend on t, the inner product hh*, *ii\u03b7+ is invariant under the dynamics generated by H, [8]. This in turn implies that the right-hand side of (21) should be t-independent.\nIn order to see this, we substitute (8) and (18) in (21) and use (16) to derive\ni\n1 h\n1/2\n\u22121/2\n(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) =\nh\u03c81 (t)|D \u03c82 (t)i + h\u03c8\u03071 (t)|D\n\u03c8\u03072 (t)i .\n(22)\n2\u03bc\n\nWe can use (5) to check that the t-derivative of the right-hand side of (22) vanishes identically.\nTherefore, (22) provides a well-defined inner product on V. Endowing V with this inner product\nand (Cauchy) completing the resulting inner product space one obtains a separable Hilbert\nspace which we shall denote by H. This is the physical Hilbert space of the relativistic QM of\nKlein-Gordon fields.\nThe inner product (22) is an example of the invariant inner products constructed in [34],\nand as explained there it has the following appealing properties: 1) It is not only positivedefinite but relativistically invariant7 ; 2) In the nonrelativistic limit, it tends to the usual\nL2 -inner product of L2 (R3 ); 3) It coincides with the inner product obtained in [39] within the\nframework of constraint quantization8 ; 4) Its restriction to the subspace of positive-frequency\nKlein-Gordon fields is identical with the restriction of the indefinite Klein-Gordon inner product\nto this subspace.\nAs seen from (21), the operator Ut for any value of t \u2208 R is a unitary operator mapping H\nto the Hilbert space K. Let t0 \u2208 R be an arbitrary initial time, and h : H \u2192 H be defined by\nh := Ut\u22121\nH Ut0 .\n0\n\n(23)\n\nThen, using (8), (9) and (20), one can show that for all \u03c8 \u2208 V,\nh\u03c8 = i~\u03c8\u0307,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03c8\u0307 is the element of V defined by\n\u03c8\u0307(t) :=\n\nd\n\u03c8(t),\ndt\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R.\n\n7\n\nA manifestly covariant expression for this inner product is given in [38].\nIt is also identical with the inner product given in [31]. This will be clear after we discuss the connection\nto the approach of [31] in Section 4.\n8\n\n7\n\n\fIt is important to note that (24) is not a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation determining\nt-dependence of \u03c8(t). It is rather the definition of the operator h.\nThe time-evolution generated by h via the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ni~\n\nd\n\u03c8t = h\u03c8t\ndt\n\n(25)\n\nis precisely the time-translations in the space V of the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation (5), i.e., if \u03c80 = \u03c8t0 is the initial value for the one-parameter family of elements \u03c8t of V,\nthen for all t, t\u2032 \u2208 R, \u03c8t (t\u2032 ) = (e\u2212i(t\u2212t0 )h/~\u03c80 )(t\u2032 ) = \u03c80 (t\u2032 + t \u2212 t0 ).9\nFurthermore, using the fact that Ut0 is a unitary operator and that H is Hermitian with\nrespect to the inner product (18) of K, we can infer that h is Hermitian with respect to the\ninner product (21) of H, i.e., time-translations correspond to unitary transformations of the\nphysical Hilbert space H.\nNext, we respectively define U : H \u2192 H\u2032 and H \u2032 : H\u2032 \u2192 H\u2032 by\nU\n\n= \u03c1 Ut0\n\n(26)\n\nH \u2032 := U h U \u22121 = \u03c1H\u03c1\u22121 ,\nwhere \u03c1 is the unique positive square root of \u03b7+ . It is not difficult to see that\n!\n!\n\u22121\n\u22121\nX + X \u22121 X \u2212 X \u22121\nX\n+\nX\nX\n\u2212\nX\n1\n1\n,\n\u03c1\u22121 =\n.\n\u03c1=\n2\n2\nX \u2212 X \u22121 X + X \u22121\nX \u22121 \u2212 X X \u22121 + X\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nWe can check that the operator \u03c1 viewed as mapping K onto H\u2032 is a unitary transformation;\n\u221a\nusing \u03c1\u2020 = \u03c1 = \u03b7 + , we have h\u03c1 \u03be, \u03c1 \u03b6i = hh\u03be, \u03b6ii\u03b7+ for all \u03be, \u03b6 \u2208 K. This in turn implies that\nU : H \u2192 H\u2032 is also a unitary transformation,\nhU\u03c81 , U\u03c82 i = (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ),\n\n\u2200\u03c81 , \u03c82 \u2208 H,\n\n(29)\n\nand that H \u2032 must be a Hermitian Hamiltonian operator acting in H\u2032 .\nWe can compute H \u2032 by substituting (28) and (9) in (27). This leads to the remarkable\nresult:\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a\nD\n0\n\u221a\n= ~ D \u03c33 ,\nH\u2032 = ~\n(30)\n0 \u2212 D\n\nwhich is manifestly Hermitian with respect to the inner product h*, *i of H\u2032 . The Hamiltonian\nH \u2032 is precisely the Foldy Hamiltonian [36]. Here it is obtained in an attempt to devise a QM\nof Klein-Gordon fields that allows for a genuine probabilistic interpretation without restricting\nto the subspace of positive-frequency fields.\nNext, we compute the explicit form of the unitary operator U and its inverse. Using (26),\n(28), (16), and (20), we have for all \u03c8 \u2208 H,\n!\nD 1/4 \u03c8(t0 ) + iD \u22121/4 \u03c8\u0307(t0 )\n1\n.\n(31)\nU\u03c8 = \u221a\n2 \u03bc\nD 1/4 \u03c8(t0 ) \u2212 iD \u22121/4 \u03c8\u0307(t0 )\n9\n\nFor a derivation of this relation and a detailed discussion of the difference between (24) and (25) see Sec. 4.2\nof [35].\n\n8\n\n\fThe fact that the arbitrary parameter \u03bb, introduced in the two-component formulation of the\nKlein-Gordon equation, does not appear in (30) and (31) is remarkable. The inverse of U \u22121 is\nalso easy to calculate. Let \u03be \u2208 H\u2032 be a two-component vector (as in (17)) with components \u03be 1\nand \u03be 2 belonging to the domain D of D. Then in view of (31), U \u22121 \u03be is the Klein-Gordon field\n\u03c8 \u2208 H satisfying the following initial conditions.\n\u03c8(t0 ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u0307(t0 ) = \u2212i \u03bc D 1/4 (\u03be 1 \u2212 \u03be 2).\n\n\u03bc D \u22121/4 (\u03be 1 + \u03be 2 ),\n\n(32)\n\nNext, we recall that for any Klein-Gordon field \u03c8 and t \u2208 R, we can express \u03c8(t) in terms of\nthe initial data (\u03c8(t0 ), \u03c8\u0307(t0 )) according to [40, 35]\n\u03c8(t) = cos[(t \u2212 t0 )D 1/2 ]\u03c8(t0 ) + sin[(t \u2212 t0 )D 1/2 ]D \u22121/2 \u03c8\u0307(t0 ).\n\n(33)\n\nCombining (32) and (33), we find\n[U \u22121 \u03be](t) =\n\n\u221a\n\ni\nh\n1/2\n1/2\n\u03bc D \u22121/4 e\u2212i(t\u2212t0 )D \u03be 1 + ei(t\u2212t0 )D \u03be 2 .\n\n(34)\n\nIn light of the above analysis, the pairs (H, h), (K, H), and (H\u2032 , H \u2032 ) are mutually unitarily equivalent; they represent the same quantum system. In particular, we can identify the\nobservables of this quantum system and explore its symmetries using any of these pairs.\n\n3\n\nPT -, C-, and CPT -Symmetries of Klein-Gordon Fields\n\nAccording to [15], the generalized parity P, time-reversal T , and charge-conjugation C for a\nquasi-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a nondegenerate discrete spectrum are given by\nX\n(\u22121)n |\u03c6n ih\u03c6n |,\n(35)\nP =\nn\n\nT\n\n=\n\nC =\n\nX\nn\n\nX\nn\n\n(\u22121)n |\u03c6n i \u22c6 h\u03c6n |,\n\n(36)\n\n(\u22121)n |\u03c8n ih\u03c6n |,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere n is a spectral label taking nonnegative integer values, {\u03c8n , \u03c6n } is a complete biorthonormal system with \u03c8n and \u03c6n being respectively the eigenvectors of H and H \u2020 , \u22c6 is the complexconjugation operator defined by, for all complex numbers z and state vectors \u03c8, \u03c6,\n\u22c6z = z \u2217 ,\n\n(\u22c6h\u03c6|)|\u03c8i := \u22c6 h\u03c6|\u03c8i = h\u03c8|\u03c6i,\n\nand the positive-definite metric has the form\nX\n\u03b7+ =\n|\u03c6n ih\u03c6n |.\n\n(38)\n\nn\n\nNote that as the labelling of the eigenvectors is arbitrary, so is the assignment of the signs\n(\u22121)n in (35) \u2013 (37).\n9\n\n\fFor the Hamiltonian (9), there is a natural choice of a sign assignment for the eigenvectors.\nThis is associated with the label \u01eb appearing in the expression for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of H. Using this sign assignment and (35) \u2013 (37), we obtain the following generalized\nparity, time-reversal, and charge-conjugation operators for the two-component Klein-Gordon\nfields.\nXZ\nP :=\nd3 k \u01eb|\u03a6\u01eb,~k ih\u03a6\u01eb,~k |,\n(39)\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nT\n\n:=\n\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nC :=\n\nR3\n\nXZ\n\nR3\n\nXZ\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nd3 k \u01eb|\u03a6\u01eb,~k i \u22c6 h\u03a6\u01eb,~k |,\n\n(40)\n\nd3 k \u01eb|\u03a8\u01eb,~k ih\u03a6\u01eb,~k |.\n\n(41)\n\nSubstituting (12) and (13) in these equations and doing the necessary algebra, we find the\nrather remarkable result:\nP = \u03c33 ,\n\nT = \u03c33 \u22c6,\n\nPT = \u22c6.\n\n(42)\n\nHence, the PT -symmetry of the Hamiltonian (9) is equivalent to the statement that it is a real\noperator. Similarly, we compute\n!\nX 2 + X \u22122\nX 2 \u2212 X \u22122\n1\n,\n(43)\nC=\n2 \u2212X 2 + X \u22122 \u2212(X 2 + X \u22122 )\n\u22121\nwhich in view of (15) is consistent with the identity C = \u03b7+\nP (equivalently \u03b7+ = PC.)\nBy construction, C generates a symmetry of the Hamiltonian (9). The meaning of this\nsymmetry becomes clear, once we use the following alternative expression for C:\n\nH\nC = ~\u22121 D \u22121/2 H = \u221a .\nH2\n\n(44)\n\nHere we have made used of (43), (16), (9) and the fact that unlike H, H 2 is a positive-definite\noperator acting in H\u2032 . This follows from the identity H 2 = ~2 DI, where I is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity\nmatrix. According to (44), C is a Z2 -grading operator for the Hilbert space that splits it into\nthe spans of the eigenvectors of H with positive and negative eigenvalues, respectively.\nWe can use the unitary operator Ut0 : H \u2192 K to define the generalized parity, time-reversal,\nand charge-conjugation operators for the ordinary single-component Klein-Gordon fields. These\nare given by\nP := Ut\u22121\nPUt0 ,\n0\n\nT := Ut\u22121\nT Ut0 ,\n0\n\nC := Ut\u22121\nCUt0 .\n0\n\n(45)\n\nUsing the definition of the operator Ut0 , we may obtain expressions for the action of the operators P and T on a given Klein-Gordon field \u03c8 \u2208 H. More interesting are the corresponding\nexpressions for the action of PT and C, that actually generate symmetries of the Hamiltonian\nh. It turns out that, for all \u03c8 \u2208 H and t \u2208 R,\n(PT\u03c8)(t) = \u03c8(\u2212t).\n10\n\n(46)\n\n\fHence PT is just the ordinary time-reversal operator, and the PT-symmetry of h means that\nthe order in which one performs a time-translation and a time-reversal transformation on a\nKlein-Gordon field is not important.\nNext, consider the subspaces V+ and V\u2212 of V that are respectively spanned by the positiveand negative-energy eigenvectors of h. The elements \u03c8\u00b1 of V\u00b1 are of the form\nZ\n\u03c8\u00b1 (t) =\nd3 k e\u2213i\u03c9k t f (~k) \u03c6~k\n(47)\nR3\n\nfor some f \u2208 L2 (R3 ). Clearly V = V+ \u2295 V\u2212 , and restricting the inner product (*, *) to V\u00b1 (and\ncompleting the resulting inner product spaces) we obtain Hilbert subspaces H\u00b1 of H. In view\nof (22) and (47), we can further show that\n(\u03c8+ , \u03c8\u2212 ) = 0,\n\n\u2200\u03c8\u00b1 \u2208 V\u00b1 .\n\nThis is sufficient to infer that indeed H = H+ \u2295 H\u2212 . The generalized charge-conjugation\noperator C defined by (45) is actually the grading operator associated with this orthogonal\ndirect sum decomposition of H, i.e., if \u03c8 = \u03c8+ + \u03c8\u2212 such that \u03c8\u00b1 \u2208 H\u00b1 , then\nC \u03c8 = \u03c8+ \u2212 \u03c8\u2212 .\n\n(48)\n\nIn other words, C is the operator that decomposes the Hilbert space into its positive- and\nnegative-energy subspaces. In view of the fact that for a complex Klein-Gordon field the positive\nand negative energies respectively occur for positive and negative charges, C is identical with\nthe charge-grading operator. As a result, the C-symmetry of h means that the charge of a\nKlein-Gordon field does not change sign under time-translations, and the CPT-symmetry of\nh is equivalent to the statement that the combined action of time-reversal and charge-grading\noperators commutes with any time-translation of a Klein-Gordon field.\nNext, we use the unitary operator \u03c1 : K \u2192 H\u2032 to express the generalized parity, timereversal, and charge-conjugation operators in the Foldy representation of the Klein-Gordon\nfields which is based on the Hilbert space H\u2032 and the Hamiltonian H \u2032 . They are given by\nP \u2032 := \u03c1 P\u03c1\u22121 ,\n\nT \u2032 := \u03c1 T \u03c1\u22121 ,\n\nC \u2032 := \u03c1 C\u03c1\u22121 .\n\n(49)\n\nAgain, we compute the form of the symmetry generators P \u2032 T \u2032 and C \u2032 . Because \u03c1 and \u03c1\u22121 are\nreal operators,\nP \u2032 T \u2032 = PT = \u22c6.\n(50)\nMoreover, using (44), (27) and (49),\nH\u2032\nC \u2032 = \u221a \u2032 = \u03c33 .\nH2\n\n(51)\n\nClearly, the P \u2032 T \u2032 -symmetry of H \u2032 is related to the fact that H \u2032 is a real operator, and the\nC \u2032 -symmetry of H \u2032 is because it is proportional to C \u2032 . Obviously, the physical interpretation of\nthe generalized P T - and C-symmetries is independent of the choice of the unitary-equivalent\n11\n\n\frepresentations of the underlying quantum system. As seen from the above analysis, the representation based on the Hilbert space H and Hamiltonian h is useful in identifying PT as\nordinary time-reversal operator, while the Foldy representation is useful in identifying C with\nthe charge-grading operator.\n\n4\n\nPhysical Observables and Wave Functions for KleinGordon Fields\n\nIn the preceding section we introduced three equivalent representations of the QM of a KleinGordon field. These corresponded to the following choices for the pair (Hilbert space, Hamiltonian): (H, h), (K, H), and (H\u2032 , H \u2032). We can study the physical observables of this quantum\ntheory using any of these representations. We will employ the usual notion of quantum mechanical observables, namely identify them with Hermitian operators acting in the Hilbert space.\nBecause H\u2032 = L2 (R3 ) \u2295 L2 (R3 ), the Foldy representation (H\u2032 , H \u2032) is more convenient for the\nconstruction of the observables. Once this is done, we may use the unitary map U : H \u2192 H\u2032\nto obtain the form of the observables in the representation (H, h).\nFirst, we introduce the following set of basic observables (in the Foldy representation) that\ncan be used to construct others.\n~ \u03bc := ~x \u2297 \u03c3\u03bc ,\nX\n\nP~\u03bc := ~p \u2297 \u03c3\u03bc ,\n\nS\u03bc := 1 \u2297 \u03c3\u03bc .\n\n(52)\n\nHere, \u03bc \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, ~x, ~p, and 1 are the position, momentum, and identity operators acting\nin L2 (R3 ), \u03c30 = I is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix, and \u03c3\u03bc with \u03bc 6= 0 are the Pauli matrices:\n!\n!\n!\n0\n\u03c31 = 01 10 , \u03c31 = 0i \u2212i\n, \u03c33 = 10 \u22121\n. In the following, we will adopt the abbreviated\n0\nnotation of not writing '1\u2297' explicitly. In particular, we will identify S\u03bc with \u03c3\u03bc .\n~ 0 and \u03c33 form a maximal set of commuting operators. In particular, we can use\nClearly, X\ntheir common 'eigenvectors' (\u03be\u01eb,~x ) to construct a basis of H\u2032 . These are defined, for all ~x \u2208 R3\nand \u01eb \u2208 {\u2212, +}, by\n\u03be\u01eb,~x := |~xi \u2297 e\u01eb ,\n(53)\nwhere e+ =\n\n1\n0\n\n!\n\n, e\u2212 =\n\n0\n1\n\n!\n\n, and |~xi are the \u03b4-function normalized position kets satisfying\n\n~x|~xi = ~x|~xi,\n\n3\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\nhx|x i = \u03b4 (~x \u2212 ~x ),\n\nR3\n\nd3 x |~xih~x| = 1.\n\n~ 0 \u03be\u01eb,~x = ~x \u03be\u01eb,~x and \u03c33 \u03be\u01eb,~x = \u01eb \u03be\u01eb,~x . Furthermore,\nIt is easy to see that indeed X\nXZ\n3\n\u2032\nd3 x |\u03be\u01eb,~x ih\u03be\u01eb,~x| = \u03c30 .\nh\u03be\u01eb,~x , \u03be~x\u2032,\u01eb\u2032 i = \u03b4\u01eb,\u01eb\u2032 \u03b4 (~x \u2212 ~x ),\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\n12\n\n(55)\n\nR3\n\nWe can express any two-component vector \u03a8\u2032 \u2208 H\u2032 in the basis {\u03be\u01eb,~x} according to\nXZ\n\u2032\n\u03a8 =\nd3 x f (\u01eb, ~x) \u03be\u01eb,~x,\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\n(54)\n\n(56)\n\n\fwhere f : {\u2212, +}\u00d7R3 \u2192 C is the wave function associated with \u03a8\u2032 in the position-representation,\ni.e.,\nf (\u01eb, ~x) := h\u03be\u01eb,~x, \u03a8\u2032 i.\n(57)\nAs is well-known from nonrelativistic QM, one can also express the observables as linear operators acting on the wave functions f . For example, let O \u2032 : H\u2032 \u2192 H\u2032 be a Hermitian operator\ndefining a physical observables in the Foldy representation and \u03a8\u2032 = U\u03c8 describe a KleinGordon field \u03c8 \u2208 H in this representation. Then\nXZ\n\u2032 \u2032\nd3 x [\u00d4f (\u01eb, ~x)] \u03be\u01eb,~x,\n(58)\nO\u03a8 =\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nwhere\n\u00d4f (\u01eb, ~x) :=\n\nXZ\n\n\u01eb\u2032 =\u00b1\n\nd3 x\u2032 \u00d4(\u01eb, ~x; \u01eb\u2032 , ~x\u2032 )f (\u01eb\u2032 , ~x\u2032 ),\n\n(59)\n\nR3\n\n\u00d4(\u01eb, ~x; \u01eb\u2032 , ~x\u2032 ) := h\u03be\u01eb,~x , O \u2032\u03be\u01eb\u2032 ,~x\u2032 i.\n\n(60)\n\nNext, we introduce the operators\n~ \u03bc U,\n~x\u03bc := U \u22121 X\n\n~p\u03bc := U \u22121 P~\u03bc U,\n\ns\u03bc := U \u22121 \u03c3\u03bc U,\n\n(61)\n\nthat act in H, and define the Klein-Gordon fields\n\u03c8\u01eb,~x := U \u22121 \u03be\u01eb,~x .\n\n(62)\n\nClearly, (61) describe the same physical observables as (52), albeit in the representation (H, h).\nThe fields (62) form a complete orthonormal basis of H; one can easily check using (29), (55),\nand (62) that\nXZ\n3\n\u2032\nd3 x |\u03c8\u01eb,~x )(\u03c8\u01eb,~x | = s0 .\n(63)\n(\u03c8\u01eb,~x , \u03c8\u01eb\u2032 ,~x\u2032 ) = \u03b4\u01eb,\u01eb\u2032 \u03b4 (~x \u2212 ~x ),\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nNote that here for all \u03c81 , \u03c82 \u2208 H, the operator |\u03c81 )(\u03c82 | is defined by |\u03c81 )(\u03c82 |\u03c83 := (\u03c82 , \u03c83 )\u03c81 ,\nfor any \u03c83 \u2208 H, and that s0 coincides with the identity operator for H.\nAgain, any Klein-Gordon field \u03c8 may be expressed in the basis {\u03c8\u01eb,~x } in terms of the wave\nfunctions (57) according to\nXZ\n\u03c8=\nd3 x f (\u01eb, ~x) \u03c8\u01eb,~x .\n(64)\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nThis follows from (63) and (\u03c8\u01eb,~x , \u03c8) = hU\u03c8\u01eb,~x , U\u03c8i = h\u03be\u01eb,~x, \u03a8\u2032 i = f (\u01eb, ~x). Similarly, any Hermitian operator o : H \u2192 H associated with a physical observable satisfies\nXZ\no\u03c8 =\nd3 x[\u00d4f (\u01eb, ~x)]\u03c8\u01eb,~x ,\n(65)\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nwhere \u00d4f (\u01eb, ~x) is defined by (59) and\n\u00d4(\u01eb, ~x; \u01eb\u2032 , ~x\u2032 ) := (\u03c8\u01eb,~x , o \u03c8\u01eb\u2032,~x\u2032 ).\n13\n\n(66)\n\n\fThe wave functions f also provide a description of the quantum system associated with the\nKlein-Gordon fields. To see this, first we use (64) and (63) to compute the inner product of a\npair of Klein-Gordon fields, \u03c8, \u03b3 \u2208 H, in terms of their wave functions f (\u01eb, ~x) := (\u03c8\u01eb,~x , \u03c8) and\ng(\u01eb, ~x) := (\u03c8\u01eb,~x , \u03b3). This yields\nXZ\n(\u03c8, \u03b3) =\nd3 x f (\u01eb, ~x)\u2217 g(\u01eb, ~x).\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nMore generally, for any Hermitian operator o : H \u2192 H describing an observable, we have\nXZ\nXZ\n3\n\u2217\n(\u03c8, o \u03b3) =\nd x f (\u01eb, ~x) \u00d4g(\u01eb, ~x) =\nd3 x [\u00d4f (\u01eb, ~x)]\u2217 g(\u01eb, ~x).\n(67)\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\n\u01eb=\u00b1\n\nR3\n\nThis shows that the wave functions f may be viewed as elements of H\u2032 , and the observables\nmay be described by Hermitian operators \u00d4 acting on the wave functions. For example, the\naction of ~x0 , p~0 , and s3 on \u03c8 corresponds to the action of the operators ~x\u02c60 , p~\u02c60 , and \u015d3 on f ,\nwhere\n~x\u02c60 f (\u01eb, ~x) = ~xf (\u01eb, ~x),\n\n~ (\u01eb, ~x),\np~\u02c60 f (\u01eb, ~x) = \u2212i~\u2207f\n\n\u015d3 f (\u01eb, ~x) = \u01ebf (\u01eb, ~x).\n\n(68)\n\nSimilarly, the action of the Hamiltonian h on \u03c8 corresponds to the action,\n\nof the operator\n\np\n\u0125f (\u01eb, ~x) = ~\u01eb \u2212\u22072 + \u03bc2 f (\u01eb, ~x),\n\u0125 := \u015d3\n\nq\n\np~\u02c620 + m2\n\n(69)\n\n(70)\n\non the wave function f .\nHaving expressed h in terms of the wave functions f , we can also obtain the explicit form\nof the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (25) as a partial differential equation for f . The result is\n\u221a\ni~\u2202t f (\u01eb, ~x; t) = \u01eb \u2212~2 \u22072 + m2 f (\u01eb, ~x; t),\n\n(71)\n\nwhere f (\u01eb, ~x; t) = (\u03c8\u01eb,~x , \u03c8t ) is the wave function for the one-parameter family of the (timetranslated) Klein-Gordon fields \u03c8t . Furthermore, applying i\u2202t to both side (71), we can check\nthat the wave functions f also satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation:\n[\u2202t2 \u2212 \u22072 + \u03bc2 ]f (\u01eb, ~x; t) = 0.\n\n(72)\n\nWe wish to emphasize that we have obtained this equation by iterating the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (71). Unlike the Klein-Gordon equation, the solutions of (71) are uniquely determined by\na single initial condition.\n~ 0 , the\nNext, recall that because the time-reversal operator (50) acting in H\u2032 commutes with X\neigenvectors \u03be\u01eb,~x may be taken to be real. In this case the action of the time-reversal operator\nT = PT on any \u03c8 \u2208 H is equivalent to the complex-conjugation of the associated wave-function\n14\n\n\ff . Denoting by T\u0302 the time-reversal operator acting on f , we have T\u0302 f (\u01eb, ~x) = f (\u01eb, ~x)\u2217 . Similarly,\nwe can identify the operator \u015d3 with the charge-grading operator acting on the wave functions.\nThe description of the QM of the Klein-Gordon fields using the wave functions f (\u01eb, ~x) is\nidentical with the one offered in [31]. The two approaches differ in that ours is motivated\nand relies on the construction of a positive-definite, relativistic invariant, and conserved inner\nproduct on the solution space of the Klein-Gordon equation whereas that of [31] rests on\nthe canonical quantization of the associated classical relativistic particle and obtaining an\nappropriate representation of the algebra of basic observables. The fact that both approaches\nlead to unitary-equivalent pictures is quite remarkable and most comforting.\nAs we shall see in the following section f (\u01eb, ~x) is the position wave function for a state\nvector (field) \u03c8 \u2208 H where the position operator is precisely the Newton-Wigner operator [27]\n(for \u01eb = +1 and its analog for \u01eb = \u22121). The latter is well-known not to be relativistically\ncovariant. Hence the description of the system using the wave functions f (\u01eb, ~x) is a noncovariant description of a quantum system that does admit a unitary-equivalent covariant\ndescription, namely the one offered by the Hilbert space H and the Hamiltonian h.\n\n5\n\nPosition Operators and Localized States\n\nIn canonical approach to QM, the observables of a quantum system are described by Hermitian\noperators acting in the Hilbert space. The physical interpretation of these operators, however,\nrests on the quantization scheme, i.e., the way in which the Hermitian operators are related\nto the classical observables. The classical system associated with the Klein-Gordon fields is\np\na relativistic free particle whose energy is given by E = \u00b1 p2 + m2 .10 Performing canonical\np\n~ one finds E \u2192 \u00b1~ \u2212\u22072 + \u03bc2 . In\nquantization [41] on this system, i.e., setting p~ \u2192 \u2212i~\u2207,\nview of (69) and (70), this implies that the canonical quantization is relevant to the description\nof the Klein-Gordon fields \u03c8 in terms of their wave functions f .11 As a result, the operators\n~x\u02c60 and ~p\u02c60 that clearly satisfy the canonical commutation relations may be identified with the\nposition and momentum operators acting in the space of the wave functions f . This in turn\n~ 0 and P~0 in the Foldy representation and the operators ~x0 and p~0 in\nmeans that the operators X\nthe (H, h)-representation also describe the position and momentum observables. In particular,\nthe basis vectors \u03be\u01eb,~x and \u03c8\u01eb,~x determine the states of the system with a definite position value\n~x; they are localized in space. They also have definite charge.\nNext, we obtain the explicit form of the position operator ~x0 that is defined to act on the\nKlein-Gordon fields \u03c8 \u2208 H. Note that \u03c7\n~ := ~x0 \u03c8 is a three-component field whose components\nsatisfy the Klein-Gordon equation (5). It is uniquely determined in terms of its initial data\n(~\n\u03c7(t0 ), \u03c7\n~ \u0307 (t0 )) for some t0 \u2208 R. We can compute the latter using (61), (31), (32), and the\n~ (~p), where F is a differentiable function.\nidentities: D = ~\u22122 (~p2 + m2 ) and [F (~p), ~x] = \u2212i~\u2207F\n10\n11\n\nNote that the negative sign is not ruled out by special relativity.\nThis is actually the case as shown in [31].\n\n15\n\n\fThis yields\n\u03c7\n~ \u0307 (t0 ) = X~ \u2020 \u03c8\u0307(t0 ),\n\n\u03c7\n~ (t0 ) = X~ \u03c8(t0 ),\nwhere\n\n(73)\n\ni~ ~p\n.\n+ m2 )\n\nX~ := ~x +\n\n(74)\n\n2(~p2\n\nWe can employ (33) to express \u03c7\n~ (t) in terms of (73). The resulting expression is\n\u03c7\n~ (t) = cos[(t \u2212 t0 )D 1/2 ]~\n\u03c7(t0 ) + sin[(t \u2212 t0 )D 1/2 ]D \u22121/2 \u03c7\n~ \u0307 (t0 ),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 R.\n\n(75)\n\nNow, substituting (73) and (74) in this equation, using the power series expansion of sin and\ncos, and doing the necessary calculations, we find\nh\ni\n[~x0 \u03c8](t) = \u03c7\n~ (t) = ~x \u03c8(t) \u2212 ~q J1 (t \u2212 t0 )\u03c8(t0 ) + J2 (t \u2212 t0 )\u03c8\u0307(t0 ) ,\n\u2200t \u2208 R,\n(76)\nwhere\n\n~q :=\n\ni~ ~p\n,\n+ m2 )\n\n(77)\n\n2(~p2\n\nand for all \u03c4 \u2208 R\nJ1 (\u03c4 ) := \u2212 cos(\u03c4 D\n\n1/2\n\n) \u2212 2\u03c4 sin(\u03c4 D\n\n1/2\n\n)D\n\n1/2\n\n=\n\nJ2 (\u03c4 ) := 2\u03c4 cos(\u03c4 D 1/2 ) \u2212 sin(\u03c4 D 1/2 )D \u22121/2 =\n\n\u0015\n\u221e \u0014\nX\n(\u22121)l (4l \u2212 1)\nl=0\n\n(2l)!\n\n\u0015\n\u221e \u0014\nX\n(\u22121)l (4l + 1)\nl=0\n\n(2l + 1)!\n\n\u03c4 2l D l ,\n\n\u03c4 2l+1 D l .\n\nIn addition to being a Hermitian operator acting in the physical Hilbert space H, the\nposition operator ~x0 has the following notable properties.\n1. In view of (73) and (74), it coincides with the Newton-Wigner position operator [27, 42],\nif it is restricted to the positive-frequency Klein-Gordon fields. Indeed, (76) provides an\nexplicit form of the Newton-Wigner position operator that, to the best of our knowledge,\nhas not been previously given.\n2. It respects the charge superselection rule [43, 44], for it commutes with the charge-grading\noperator C = s3 . This is easily seen by noting that ~x0 and s3 are respectively obtained\n~ 0 and S\n~3 = \u03c33 , and that according to (52),\nvia a similarity transformation (61) from X\n~ 0 , \u03c33 ] = 0.\n[X\n3. It has the correct nonrelativistic limit: as c \u2192 \u221e, [~x0 \u03c8](t) \u2192 ~x\u03c8(t).\nWe can similarly evaluate the action of the momentum operator p~0 on \u03c8. Because P~0 and \u03c1\ncommute, in view of (61) and (26), we have ~p0 = Ut\u22121\nP~0 Ut0 . This in turn implies [~p \u03c8](t) = ~p \u03c8(t)\n0\nfor all t \u2208 R. Furthermore, in view of the fact that for every differentiable element \u03c6 of L2 (R3 )\nwith nonzero gradient, ~q \u03c6 is along ~p \u03c6, we can show that the angular momentum operator\n~ := ~x0 \u00d7 p~0 acts on \u03c8 according to [L\n~ \u03c8](t) = ~x \u00d7 ~p \u03c8(t) for all t \u2208 R. Therefore, unlike the\nL\n16\n\n\f~ operators have\nposition operator ~x0 , the (linear) momentum p~0 and the angular momentum L\nthe same expressions as in nonrelativistic QM.\nHaving obtained the position and momentum observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we can\nalso introduce a set of q\ncoherent states by requiring that they are the eigenstates of the annik\n(~x0 + ik \u22121 ~p0 ), where k = m\u03c9 \u2208 R is the characteristic oscillator\nhilation operator ~a := 2~\nconstant. Because both ~x0 and p~0 commute with the charge-grading operator s3 , so does the\nannihilation operator ~a. This suggests that we can introduce coherent states that have a definite\ncharge. The corresponding state vectors |~z, \u01eb) are defined as the common eigenvectors of ~a and\ns3 , i.e., ~a|~z , \u01eb) = ~z |~z, \u01eb) and s3 |~z , \u01eb) = \u01eb|~z , \u01eb), where ~z \u2208 C3 and \u01eb \u2208 {\u2212, +}. By construction,\nthe coherent states represented by the vectors |~z, \u01eb) are free from the subtleties associated with\nthe nontrivial charge structure of the conventional relativistic coherent states [44].\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we have explored a concrete realization of the notions of generalized parity\n(P), time-reversal (T ), and charge-conjugation (C) operators for Klein-Gordon fields, and\nshowed that the generalized parity-time-reversal and charge-conjugation symmetries that arise\nin pseudo-Hermitian QM have well-known physical meanings in relativistic QM; they simply\nmean that the time-translations of a Klein-Gordon field commute with the time-reversal and\ncharge-grading operators. In particular, C is not the usual charge-conjugation operator of\nrelativistic QM, for it does not map a positive-frequency field to a negative-frequency field.\nRather, it is a grading operator that splits the Hilbert space into the subspaces of positive- and\nnegative-frequency fields. Being a Hermitian operator acting the Hilbert space of the system\nC is an observable. Its classical analog and its significance in the study of Klein-Gordon fields\nwere initially noted in [31] and subsequently employed in [32, 33].\nThe theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators that was initially developed for the purpose of\nmaking sense of P T -symmetric QM provides an invaluable tool for devising a genuine quantum\nmechanical description of Klein-Gordon fields. It allows for an explicit construction of the\nHilbert space H of the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. It yields a simple description\nof the physical observables in terms of Hermitian operators acting in the Hilbert space H or\nequivalently H\u2032 = L2 (R3 ) \u2295 L2 (R3 ). It leads to the introduction of a set of wave functions f\nthat uniquely determine the Klein-Gordon fields \u03c8 and at the same time satisfy a Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation.12\nThe quantum theory of Klein-Gordon fields outlined in this article shares almost all the\nproperties of ordinary nonrelativistic quantum systems. It provides a simple construction of\na position operator that fulfills the requirements of the charge-superselection rule and allows\nfor the identification of a set of relativistic localized and coherent states. Restricting to the\n12\n\nThis may be viewed as an interesting link between relativistic and nonrelativistic QM on the one hand, and\nin view of the results of [31] the link to one-particle sector of the corresponding quantum field theory on the\nother hand.\n\n17\n\n\fspace of positive-frequency Klein-Gordon field, this position operator and consequently the\ncorresponding localized states coincide with those obtained by Newton and Wigner [27] through\ntheir axiomatic construction.\nThe quantum theory developed here is relativistic in nature, for the inner product of the\nHilbert space H and consequently the transition and scattering amplitudes are invariant under\nLorentz transformations. It also has the QM of a free particle as its nonrelativistic limit. In\nparticular, the Hilbert space, the Hamiltonian, and the basic position and momentum operators\ntend to their well-known nonrelativistic analogues as one takes c \u2192 \u221e.13\nFinally, we note that the approach pursued in this article can be easily generalized to KleinGordon fields interacting with a time-independent magnetic field. This amounts to a simple\n~ \u2212 A(~\n~ x))2 + \u03bc2 ]\u03c8(t, ~x), where A\n~\nredefinition of the operator D from (6) to [D\u03c8(t)](~x) := [\u2212(\u2207\nis a corresponding vector potential. In view of the general theory developed in [35], one may\nattempt to treat the case of time-dependent electromagnetic fields [38].\n\nAcknowledgments\nI wish to thank Ali \u00dclger for a useful discussion and Farhad Zamani for pointing out a terminological error made in the draft of this article.
