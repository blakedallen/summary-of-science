The three different eclipses monitored by XMM-Newton suggest a broad range\nin cloud velocities (by a factor \u223c4-5). Moreover, two iron absorption lines clearly\nassociated with each eclipse suggest the presence of highly ionized gas around the\nobscuring clouds, and an outflow component of the velocity spanning from 3,000 to\n15,000 km/s.\nKey words: Galaxies: AGN - Galaxies: individual (Mrk 766)\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTime variability of X-ray absorption is a common feature\nin Active Galactive Nuclei (AGN). An analysis of column\ndensity (NH ) variations, performed on a sample of bright\nobscured AGN with multiple hard X-ray (1-10 keV) observations (Risaliti et al. 2002) revealed that NH variability is\nalmost ubiquitous among nearby Seyfert galaxies on time\nscales from a few months to a few years. In order to investigate shorter variability time scales, two strategies are\npossible: dedicated campaigns of multiple observations, or\ntime-resolved spectral analysis of single, long observations.\nIn the past few years, both methods have been used to discover NH variations on time scales from a few days down\nto a few hours for a handful of sources: NGC 1365 (Risaliti et al. 2005, 2007, 2009), NGC 4388 (Elvis et al. 2004),\nNGC 4151 (Puccetti et al. 2007), NGC 7582 (Bianchi et\nal. 2009). The physical implications of these results are that\nthe X-ray absorber must be made of clouds with linear dimensions of the order of 1013 -1014 cm, velocities in excess of\n103 km s\u22121 , and densities n\u223c1010 -1011 cm\u22123 . Assuming that\nthese clouds are orbiting around the central black hole with\nKeplerian velocities, the inferred distances from the X-ray\nsources are of the order of thousands of gravitational radii\n(RG ), corresponding to 1016 -1017 cm for black hole masses in\nthe range from 106 to a few 107 solar masses. These physical\n\nparameters are typical of the clouds emitting the broad lines\nobserved in the AGN optical and UV spectra. It is therefore\nnatural to conclude that the variable X-ray absorber and\nthe Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds are one and the same.\nIn order to further test this scenario in other sources,\nwe started a systematic analysis of all the archival long\n(>100 ks) observations of bright AGN (intrinsic 2-10 keV\nof at least 10\u221211 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) in order to search for occultations due to obscuring clouds crossing the line of sight\nto the X-ray source. Our approach is based on a preliminary analysis of the hardness-ratio (HR) light curve, with\nthe aim of selecting the time intervals with the strongest\nspectral variations, possibly due to occultations, and a subsequent complete spectral analysis of the selected intervals.\nA detailed description of this method is illustrated in Risaliti et al. 2009A, 2009B for two XMM-Newton observations\nof NGC 1365.\nHere we present a new analysis of a long (\u223c800 ks)\nXMM-Newton observation of the AGN in Mrk 766\n(z=0.0129), which exhibits strong signatures of multiple occultations.\nThe Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 766 is\nhighly variable in the hard X-ray (2-10 keV) flux, on time\nscales as short as a few hundred seconds, as typical for\nNLS1s (e.g. McHardy et al. 2004). Being one of the X-ray\n\n\f2\n\nG. Risaliti et al.\n\nbrightest sources of its class, it has been observed intensively with the main X-ray observatories, such as ROSAT\n(Molendi & Maccacaro 1994), ASCA (Leighly et al. 1996,\nNandra et al. 1997), BeppoSAX (Matt et al. 2000). More\nrecently, higher-quality XMM-Newton observations allowed\ndetailed studies of the X-ray variability (Page et al. 2001,\nBoller et al. 2001, Vaughan & Fabian 2003), and revealed\nthe presence of absorption due to highly ionized iron lines\n(Pounds et al. 2003).\nThe longest and highest quality X-ray observation available for Mrk 766 has been performed with XMM-Newton\nin 2006 over six consecutive orbits, resulting in a total\nelapsed time of about 10 days of quasi-continuous monitoring. A complete time-resolved spectral analysis of these\ndata has been presented by Miller et al. (2007) and Turner\net al. (2007, hereafter T07). In these works, the observation\nis divided in time intervals of 25 ks, and for each interval\na detailed spectral analysis is performed, testing two different scenarios: in the first one, the observed spectral and\nflux variability is ascribed to a scattering component; in the\nsecond one, the dominant changing component is a warm\nabsorber partially covering the central source. Both scenarios can adequately reproduce the observed spectral and flux\nvariability. Interestingly, in both models an extra component is needed, consisting of a partial covering by a relatively\nlow-ionization cloud with column density in the range 1022 1023 cm\u22122 . The best fit values of the column density and\nthe covering factor of this component, tabulated in T07, follow a similar variability pattern in both the scattering and\nabsorption scenarios. In particular, in both models these parameters have the highest values, and the highest statistical\nsignificance, during the first orbit and the first part of the\nsecond orbit, while they are only marginally significant for\nthe remainder of the observation. The similar behaviour of\nNH (t) in both scenarios suggests that it is possible to study\nthis component in detail independently of the interpretation\nadopted for the underlying spectrum.\nHere we concentrate our analysis on this varying cold\nabsorbtion component, trying to isolate its effects from those\nof the other components. We will show that after an appropriate selection of the time intervals the spectral analysis\nstrongly suggests the presence of three occultation events,\ndue to three different absorbers, with physical parameters\ntypical of BLR clouds.\n\n2\n\nREDUCTION AND DATA ANALYSIS.\n\nMrk 766 was observed by XMM-Newton in six consecutive\norbits from May 23 to June 03, 2005 (the observation in\nthe sixth orbit is short (\u223c30 ks) and is not analyzed here).\nThe data have been reduced and analyzed following a standard procedure, which we already described in other similar\nworks (e.g. Risaliti et al. 2009). The only non-completely\nstraightforward aspect of the reduction is the choice of the\nrejection level for the background flares. Since the source\nis bright (F(2-10 keV)\u223c2\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), we can use\na higher threshold than the conservative level suggested in\nthe XMM-Newton reduction guide. In particular, since we\nare interested in a time-resolved study, we can accept a relatively high noise in some time intervals, which otherwise\nwould be completely neglected in the analysis. We therefore\n\nremoved only the time intervals where the background flares\nappear to saturate the instruments. This led to the rejection\nof less than 20% of the observing time. Both the temporal\nand spectral analysis were performed using the PN and combined MOS spectra and light curves. On average, the MOS\ndata are more noisy than the PN one, and their contribution to the total counts is of the order of 30%. Therefore,\nall the results are dominated by the contribution of the PN\ninstrument.\nOur analysis consists in three main steps: (1) a temporal analysis of the flux and hardness ratio light curves,\nin order to determine the time intervals with significant\nspectral variations; (2) an analysis of the average spectra\nof each of these intervals, in order to determine whether the\nvariations are better explained by absorption variability or\nby changes in the underlying spectral shape, and (3) a detailed time-resolved spectral analysis of the events, under\nthe assumption that NH variability is indeed the driving\nphenomenon. We restrict our analysis to the data at energies E>1.5 keV. We note that this choice, while optimal to\nsimplify the analysis of the variable component at E>2 keV\n(and therefore, to search for neutral NH variations greater\nthan a few 1022 cm\u22122 ), prevents us from obtaining a global\nview of the possible reflector/warm absorber affecting the\nsoft part of the spectrum. For an analysis of this component, we refer to T07.\nEach step of the analysis is described below.\n\n2.1\n\nTemporal analysis\n\nIn Fig. 1 we show the 2-10 keV flux light curve for the\nwhole observation, together with the light curve of the (610 keV)/(2-5 keV) hardness ratio. As expected from previous studies (T07), the flux light curve shows strong and\nrapid variability, on time scales shorter than one ks. On average, such strong variations are not observed in the hardness ratio light curve, suggesting that most of the observed\nvariability consists of flux changes with a \u223cconstant spectral shape. The only evident exceptions are present in the\nfirst and second orbit, where we detect strong changes of the\nhardness ratio, implying variability of the spectral shape. We\nnote that the increase of the hardness ratio in these time intervals is associated to a decrease in the total flux. Therefore,\nthese variations may be due either to (1) a hardening of the\nintrinsic continuum, with a pivot point in the hard (>5 keV)\npart of the spectrum, so that the soft flux decreases more\nthan the hard one, or (2) to absorption by clouds with column density NH in the interval 1022 -5\u00d71023 cm\u22122 , which\nwould cause strong absorption in the 2-5 keV band, but little variation in the 6-10 keV band.\n\n2.2\n\nSpectral analysis of the time-averaged\nspectra\n\nWe extracted a spectrum from the third and fourth orbit\n(INT 4 in Fig. 1), where the emission remains constant in\nshape above 2 keV, and determined a model well fitting our\ndata, with reduced \u03c72 \u223c1, and no obvious residual features.\nThis model consists of a power law continuum, two Gaussian emission lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7 keV, respectively, and\na cold reflection continuum, modeled through the PEXRAV\n\n\fX-ray absorption by BLR clouds in Mrk 766\n\nINT 1 INT 2\n\nINT 3\n\n3\n\nINT 4\n\nFigure 1.

As\nshown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, this simple model is a good\nrepresentation of the data. We note that the reflected continuum is quite high (R\u223c2, implying a high covering fraction by Compton-thick gas) with respect to the equivalent\nwidth of the narrow iron emission line (EW\u223c35 eV). This\nmay be due to either a low iron abundance (a factor of \u223c2\nunder-abundance of iron would be enough to reconcile at a\n90% confidence level the R/EW ratio with that expected by\nGeorge & Fabian (1991) for an inclination of 30 degrees),\n\nor to an over-simplification of our fit, which reproduces the\nwhole curvature with respect to a simple power law above\n\u223c 3 \u2212 4 keV with this single component, while the actual\ncircumnuclear absorber/reflector may be more complex. In\norder to test the consistency of our model, we tried (a)\nfixing the R/EW ratio to the values predicted by George\nFabian (1991), and (b) replacing the PEXRAV + line components with the self-consistent REFLIONX model (Ross &\nFabian 2005). In both cases we obtained a fully acceptable\nfit (\u03c72 =2435/2365 d.o.f., and 2433/2364 d.o.f., respectively).\nA more detailed analysis, such as the one presented in T07,\ncan unveil a higher complexity, and the presence of partially\ncovering ionized absorbers. However, we stress that our main\naim here is not a detailed study of these components, but,\nrather, to obtain a reference model of the time-averaged underlying emission of the source.\nWe then added to the analysis three new spectra, obtained\nfrom the first and second half, respectively, of the first orbit\n(INT 1 and INT 2 in Fig. 1), and from the interval with\nhigh hardness ratio in the second orbit (INT 3). We fitted\nthese spectra with the same model as above, plus an extra\ncomponent consisting of a partial absorber with free column\ndensity and covering fraction. A visual analysis of the residuals (Fig. 5) suggested to further add two Gaussian components, in order to fit two absorption features in the 6.7-7.5\nspectral range.

The main results are the following:\n(a) In all cases we obtained a good fit (\u03c72red \u223c1), with the\npartial covering component highly significant in each of the\nthree intervals.\n(b) The best fit values of the column densities and covering\nfactors of the absorber are different in each interval.\n(c) The best fit slope of the continuum power law is instead\nconstant within the errors in all the spectra (including the\nnew ones and the reference ones obtained from the third and\nfourth orbit). If we repeat the fits without the partial covering absorber (so forcing the continuum slope to adjust to\nreproduce the spectral variations) we obtain a much worse\nfit, rejected at a 99.99% level in all the three fits to INT 1,\nINT 2 and INT 3. This shows that a change in the continuum slope cannot reproduce the observed spectral variability. Similarly, we also tried to leave the parameters of the\nreflection component free in each fit, and we found that the\nresults do not change significantly.\n(d) The two absorption features in the 6.7-7.5 keV interval\nare highly significant (Table 4), and compatible with the\nFeXXV K\u03b1 and FeXXVI K\u03b1 absorption lines at rest-frame\nenergies of 6.70 and 6.96 keV, respectively. We fitted the two\nlines fixing their energies and requiring a common shift.

Interestingly, the\nabsorption features are present only when a cold absorber\nis also present, while they are not detected in INT 4. Since\nthe integration time of INT 4 is much longer than in the\nthree intervals with evidence of occultations, it may be that\na variable highly ionized absorber is present also in INT 4,\nbut its signatures are averaged out in the total spectrum.\nIn order to check this possibility, we divided INT 4 in eight\nintervals, with a fixed duration of 25 ks, and repeated the\nsame spectral analysis as for the total INT 4 spectrum. In\nno case we detected an iron absorption line at a 90% significance level.

All the\nother parameters are fixed to the best fit vaues of INT 4, listed\nin Table 1. a : the column density is fixed, due to the complete\ndegeneracy with the covering factor when the latter is compatible\nwith CF =0.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the ionized absorber responsible\nfor the iron absorption lines is physically associated with the\ncold absorber.\n2.3\n\nTime-resolved analysis of the occultations.\n\nThe previous step of the analysis shows that it is possible to\ninterpret the spectral variations in the first and second orbit\nas entirely due to occultations by clouds crossing the line of\nsight to the X-ray source. Here we assume that this is the\ncorrect interpretation, and that no other continuum components are contributing to the spectral variability (while\nwe allow for possible intrinsic flux changes). In this way,\nwe are able to perform a more detailed spectral analysis on\nshorter time scales, requiring a constant shape of the continuum components. We divided the first two orbits in several\nshort intervals, as shown in Fig. 3 and 4, and performed a\ncomplete spectral analysis of each interval.\nThe length of the intervals is chosen in order to have\n\nFigure 4. Same as Fig. 3, for the second orbit of the XMMNewton observation (INT 3 in Fig. 1).\n\na balance between the need to sample the changes in hardness ratio in short time scales, and the need to have enough\ncounts in each spectrum to significantly constrain the absorber parameters. The continuum spectral parameters\n(spectral slope, reflection component) are those obtained in\nthe fit to the third and fourth orbit discussed in the previous\nstep of the analysis, and listed in Table 1. The continuum\nflux is free to vary.\nThe main results of this analysis are shown in the lower\npanels of Fig. 3 and 4, and in Table 2, and can be summarized as follows:\n-1. In all cases, we obtain a good spectral fit. This implies\nthat the observed spectral variations can be reproduced\nsatisfactorily by absorbing clouds moving across the line of\nsight to the X-ray source.\n-2. The absorbing clouds have column densities in the range\n1-3\u00d71023 cm\u22122 , while the covering factors vary from zero\nup to \u223c90% at the peak of the eclipses.\n-3. We interpret the variations observed in the first orbit as\ndue to two different clouds, one uncovering the source during intervals 1A to 1E, the other covering the source during\nintervals 2A-2E. Since the minimum measured covering factor is \u223c60% (Table 2), the two eclipses overlap in time, in a\nway that cannot be uniquely determined. The bottom panel\nof Fig. 3 shows two possible evolutions of the single occultations, both resulting in the observed light curve.\n-4. The two iron absorption lines have been included in all\nfits. In principle, this may be a powerful way to investigate possible variations of the ionized absorber. However,\nthe signal-to-noise of the single intervals is not enough for\na detailed analysis: in all the intervals we find line parame-\n\n\fG.

The\nsignificance of these detections varies considerably among\nthe different intervals: in some cases both lines are detected\nat a >4 \u03c3 statistical significance, in others we can only estimate upper limits. However, this appears to be related to\nthe total counts available in the continuum at the line energies, rather than to variations in the lines' strength. As a\nconsequence, the upper limits in the intervals with no detections are of the same order of (or even slightly larger than)\nthe values measured in the intervals with a high continuum\nlevel. For this reason, we will not discuss possible variations\nof the absorption lines further. Let us stress that unconstraining upper limits are found only in some sub-intervals\nof INT 1-3; as we said before, the analysis of INT 1-4 in\nwider time bins is instead very constraining.\n-5. The results listed above do not depend significantly\non how we fit the variability of the other spectral components. In particular, since our model consists of three main\ncomponents (the direct power law emission, the cold reflection, and the iron emission lines), we can assume different\nscenarios: 1) the continuum reflection and the emission lines\n(both the narrow and the broad one) originate from the\naccretion disc, close to the primary X-ray source, and follow the continuum variations with a time lag much shorter\nthan our time bins; 2) the reflection components (continuum\nand narrow line) are emitted far from the primary source,\nand are constant during the whole observation, while the\nbroad emission line follows the continuum variations; 3) the\ncontinuum reflection and both emission lines remain constant. We repeated our analysis in these three scenarios,\nand found that the results on the continuum occultations\nand on the absorption lines hold with the same significance\nin all cases. Therefore, we do not discuss this issue further.\nWe only note, for completeness, that statistically the first\nand second scenario are equally acceptable, while the third\nscenario produces significantly worse fits, in particular with\nstrong residuals at the broad iron line energies.\n\n5\n\n5\nEnergy (keV)\n\nEnergy (keV)\n\n\u03c72\n\nFigure 5.\nresiduals for the six intervals considered in Table 3,\ncorresponding to the three occultation events (1, 2 and 3A-C),\nthe first interval after the third occultation (3D), the remainder\nof the second orbit (3E-F), and the whole third and fourth orbits\n(4).\n\nWhile similar events have been seen in obscured AGNs\n(e.g. Wang et al. 2010, Risaliti et al. 2010, Maiolino et\nal. 2010), our analysis demonstrates that such events can\nalso be observed also in type 1 sources, which are normally\nunobscured. Indeed, the spectrum of Mrk 766 shows on average little obscuration: the eclipses occur in a small fraction\n(\u223c20%) of the observing time, and would be easily missed\nin a global spectral analysis.\nInterestingly, the analysis of T07, where the spectra are\nextracted from fixed 25 ks intervals, provides indications\nof the occultations described here: the NH values of the\ncold absorption component reported there are on average\nmarginally significant, but show local peaks and higher statistical significance in the time intervals where we find the\noccultation events. The only difference with our analysis is\ngiven by the choice of the time intervals, which in our work\nare optimized based on Fig. 1.\nIn the following sections we discuss (1) the size and distance of the obscuring clouds, as inferred from the observed\noccultations; (2) the internal structure of the clouds, as suggested by the temporal evolution of the occultations; (3) a\npossible general structure of the circumnuclear medium of\nMrk 766 accounting for all the results discussed in this paper.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe presented a time-resolved spectral analysis of a long\n(\u223c700 ks) XMM-Newton observation of the NLS1 galaxy\nMrk 766, suggesting the occurrence of occultations of the\nX-ray source due to circumnuclear clouds.\n\n3.1\n\nSize and location of the obscuring clouds\n\nThe spectral and temporal parameters of the three occultations provide information on the size and distance of the\nclouds from the X-ray source. Assuming that the X-ray\n\n\fX-ray absorption by BLR clouds in Mrk 766\nsource has a linear size of at least 5 gravitational radii, RG ,\nthe velocity\ncloud should be v>2.5\u00d7103\n\u221a of the obscuring\n\u22121\n\u2206C\nkm\ns\n,\nwhere\nM6 is the black hole mass\nM6 T\u22121\nF\n4\nin units of 106 M\u2299 , T4 is the occultation time in units of\n104 s, and \u2206CF is the covering factor variation during the\neclipse. The black hole mass estimate for Mrk 766, obtained\nfrom reverberation mapping of H\u03b2, is M6 =1.8\u00b11.5 (Bentz et\nal. 2009). The durations of the occultations seen in the first\norbit are of the order of 40 ks, with a covering factor changing by \u223c40%. This implies v1,2 >800 km s\u22121 . We note that\nthis value is not precisely estimated, because the end of the\nfist occultation probably overlaps with the beginning of the\nsecond one. We will discuss this issue in the next Subsection.\nHowever our conclusions are not affected by this relatively\nsmall uncertainty. For the third occultation we have instead\nT\u223c 10 ks and \u2206CF \u223c80%, which gives v3 >4,000 km s\u22121 . We\nnote that the ratio between the velocities depends only on\nthe ratio between the occultation times (and on the assumption of an axisymmetric cloud shape with respect to the line\nof sight). We have therefore v3 \u223c5v1,2 regardless of the uncertainties on the size of the X-ray source. The density and\ndistance of the clouds from the central black hole can be easily derived from the above estimates(assuming Keplerian velocity). We obtain a density of the order of 1010 -1011 cm\u22123 ,\nand a distance of 103 -104 RG .\nThis simple argument suggests that the X-ray eclipsing\nclouds have the physical properties and location of the BLR\nclouds.\nWe note that the above considerations can provide an\nestimate of the size of the X-ray source. The assumption\nmade above of a size of 5 RG can be considered as a \"physical\" lower limit, useful to estimate lower limits for the cloud\nvelocities. Since in the above scheme these velocities are linearly dependent on the source size, we can reverse the argument, and estimate an upper limit of the size of the X-ray\nsource based on the highest physically acceptable cloud velocity. Considering that the third cloud has an outflow velocity of \u223c16,000 km s\u22121 , we can assume a velocity on the\nplane of the sky of the same order. This implies a linear\nsize of the X-ray source of 20 RG . Adopting instead as a\n\"hard upper limit\" the highest outflowing velocity detected\nin low-luminosity AGNs (v/c\u223c0.3, Tombesi et al. 2010), we\nwould obtain a size of \u223c100 RG . Summarizing, the duration\nof the occultations are a direct observational probe of the\ncompactness of the X-ray source, with a best estimate below\n\u223c20 RG , and a maximum size of the order of 100 RG .\n3.2\n\nInternal structure of the obscuring clouds\n\nHints on the internal structure of the eclipsing clouds are\nobtained from the temporal evolution of the model parameters, as listed in Table 2 , 3 and 4. The clearest indication\nthat the clouds have a complex structure, with strong ionization gradients, is provided by the coincidence between\nthe iron absorption lines and the cold absorption: while the\npresence of the lines is clear during all the three eclipses,\nno such feature is present in any other time interval, with\nhigh statistical confidence (Table 4). Moreover, the outflow\nvelocities measured in the three occultations are not compatible with each other. This is relevant in two respects: 1)\nit demonstrates that the three occultations are due to three\ndifferent clouds; 2) it reveals a large range in outflow veloc-\n\n7\n\nities among the obscuring clouds, comparable to the range\nspanned by the transverse velocities. We discuss in detail\nthese two aspects, and the column density structure of the\neclipsing clouds.\n1) The three eclipsing clouds. While it was obvious from the previous analysis that the third occultation is\ndue to a single cloud isolated from the other two, the interpretation of the occultations in the first orbit was less\nstraightforward. In particular, the lowest measured covering factor in the first orbit is about 0.6. This means that\neither two different clouds partly overlap at the same time,\nor that a single cloud with a complex structure (a hole, or\na concave shape) is transiting across the line of sight. The\nassociation of two different outflowing velocities to the two\nphases of the eclipse seen in the first orbit (INT 1 and INT 2)\nstrongly suggests that the former scenario is the correct one.\nIf two different clouds are covering the source in the first\norbit, the slopes observed in Fig. 3 are not directly related\nto the clouds velocites along the plane of the sky. Several\ncombinations of the motion of the individual clouds can reproduce the observed pattern. In Fig. 3 we show the two\nextreme configurations acceptable in the case of a constant\nslope of the CF time evolution. In both cases, the two clouds\nare simultaneously present along the line of sight in one of\nthe two phases. However, we point out that these are just\ntwo examples of many possible combinations: there is no\nstrong physical reason to have a constant slope in the covering factor curves (the geometrical shape of the cloud and of\nthe X-ray source can easily alter this, as shown, for example, in the case of NGC 1365, Maiolino et al. 2010), and if\nwe relax the constraint on the constant slope, there are infinite ways to reproduce the observed behaviour. In principle,\nthis degeneracy may be solved through the observation of\nthe absorption lines: the presence of both clouds along the\nline of sight would imply the detection of both line pairs.\nHowever, this check is not decisive with the available S/N:\nwe tried to add a second pair of absorption lines in INT 1,\nwith a blueshift velocity of 3000 km s\u22121 (as measured in\nINT 2), and in INT 2 with a blueshift of 11,000 km s\u22121\n(as measured in INT 1), and in both cases the additional\nlines are not detected, with upper limits on their equivalent\nwidths of the order of 30 eV.1 We also repeated this check\nusing only intervals 1E and 2A (where the contribution of\nboth clouds may be stronger) and obtained an upper limit\nof the order of 80 eV, i.e. higher than the typical values in\nTable 4. We conclude that the data suggest that on average in both INT 1 and INT 2 one single cloud is dominant\n(at least for the highly ionized component), but we cannot\nexclude a significant overlap in the central part of the first\norbit.\nThe conclusions of this part of the analysis are that (1)\nthree separate clouds are responsible of the observed occultations, each with a different velocity along the plane of the\nsky, and along the line of sight; and that (2) it is not possible to uniquely disentangle the path of the two individual\n1\n\nWe note that, adding to the complication of the analysis, the difference between the velocities of the two clouds,\n\u2206v\u223c8,000 km s\u22121 , corresponds almost exactly to the difference\nin frequency between FeXXV K\u03b1 anf FeXXVI K\u03b1. As a consequence, a contribution from both clouds to just one of the observed lines is possible.\n\n\f8\n\nG. Risaliti et al.\n\nclouds responsible for the two occultations observed in the\nfirst orbit.\n2) Ionization structure. The lines detected during\nthe occultations are due to hydrogen-like and helium-like\niron ions. The physical properties (density, column density,\nionization state) of the gas responsible for these absorptions\nare not easily constrained with the observed lines. The measured parameters (equivalent widths and line flux ratios)\ncan be obtained with several combinations of column density, ionization parameter, and turbulent velocity of the gas.\nMorever, the equivalent widths scale linearly with the (unknown) iron abundance. A general treatment of this complex\nproblem is presented in Bianchi et al. (2005). Here we only\nstress the two conclusions that can be safely drawn from the\nobserved data: the ionization parameter of the gas must be\nquite high (\u03be>1,000 erg cm s\u22121 ) and the gas column density must be higher than a few 1022 cm\u22122 . On the other\nhand, the absorption observed in the continuum spectrum\nis due to nearly neutral material. We tried to replace the\nneutral absorption in our models with a ionized one, with\na free ionization parameter, \u03be and we obtained again a best\nfit with a neutral absorber, and a limit on the ionization\n\u03be<30 erg cm s\u22121 . These two phases can be explained as\ndue to a \"cometary\" structure, with a low-density, high ionization \"tail\" originating from the high-density cloud head.\nThe tail may be either behind the head, with respect to the\nobserver, or in front of the head, as in a \"real\" solar system\ncomet (Collin-Souffrin et al. 1988). In the former case, the\nwhole cloud, including the dense core, must be in outflow,\nand the tail may be due to friction with a lower density,\nhigher temperature gas phase surrounding the cloud. Instead, in the scenario where the tail is in front of the head,\nthe dense core can be in a purely Keplerian motion, and\nthe outflowing tail may be due to radiation pressure. While\nwe cannot distinguish between these two scenarios based on\nthe X-ray spectra only, we can safely rule out a spherically\nsymmetric cloud structure, without a \"head\" and a \"tail\".\nThis is due to the requirements of (1) having both the hot\nand cold phases along the line of sight at the same time,\nand (2) a difference between the ionization parameters of\nthe two phases of at least a factor of \u223c40. It is impossible\nto satisfy both these conditions with a spherical cloud: the\nlow-density external part, in order to have the required column density of at least a few 1022 cm\u22122 , must have a linear\nsize of at least 10 times that of the cold, dense part. In a\nspherical geometry, this would imply the presence of high\nionization absorption features for a long time before and after the observed eclipses. Regarding the density structure of\nthe clouds, we may have either a sudden density drop, or a\ncontinuous density gradient. In the latter case, intermediate\nionization states would be present in the cloud. Both these\nscenarios are possible, and our observations cannot distinguish among them, because the tail lies along the same line\nof sight as the neutral head. This hides the effects of possible ionization gradients, since the cold absorption removes\nall the marks of a warm absorber, except for the iron-K\nabsorption lines, which are the only strong features at energies higher than the photoelectric cut off. We note that\na low-column density tail not covered by the neutral head\nmay be present in the third cloud. A low-significance indication of such a component may be the marginal detection\nof the absorpion lines in the interval 3D (Fig. 5, Table 3),\n\nFigure 6. Scheme of the proposed structure of the absorber responsible for the observed occultations. Panel 1: structure of an\neclipsing cloud, as viewed from a direction orthogonal to the line\nof sight. Panel 2: same, as viewed from the line of sight, with the\nionized tail covered by the neutral head (either behind or in front\nof it). Panel 3: a possible structure of the circumnuclear gas in\nMrk 766, as viewed from the disc/torus plane. Panel 4: velocity\ncomponents of the eclipsing clouds, as viewed from the disc/torus\naxis. The cloud tail can be either in front (cloud 2) or behind (1)\nthe cold core with respect to the source.\n\ni.e. after the neutral eclipse is over. This line would not be\nstatistically significant if detected in an isolated spectrum\n(\u2206\u03c72 =6, Table 3) however, given the presence of similar\nlines in the previous spectra, it may be possible that this is\na real feature. A similar analysis is not possible for the first\ntwo clouds, given the overlap between the two eclipses, and\nthe lack of monitoring during the final phase of the second\neclipse.\n3) Column density structure of the eclipsing\nclouds. Hints on the column density (NH ) gradients across\nthe line of sight can be inferred by comparing the NH and\ncovering factor (CF ) light curves in Fig. 3 and 4. In general, the evidence of NH changes is not strong (the case of\nconstant column density can be rejected at a \u223c2\u03c3 level for\nINT 2, and at a \u223c3\u03c3 level fot INT 1 and INT 3). However,\nwe clearly see a general trend of a column density following the covering factor variations: the highest CF values are\nfound together with the highest NH , and vice-versa. This is\nespecially clear in INT 3 (Fig. 4) where we see all the phases\nof the eclipse. We interpret this as an evidence of a column\ndenisty gradient across the line of sight, as shown in Fig. 6\n(Panel 2). The possible relation between CF and NH may\nbe due to the partial degeneracy between these two parameters in the spectral fits. In order to check this, and in general\nto verify the precision of our error estimates, we calculated\nthe CF -NH contour plots for several representative intervals\nof the first and second orbit. The results, shown in Fig. 7,\ndemonstrate that the degeneracy between the two parame-\n\n\fX-ray absorption by BLR clouds in Mrk 766\n\n0.9\n\n1A\n1C\n\n+\n\n0.7\n\nCF\n\n0.8\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n1E\n\n20\nNH (1022 cm\u22122)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0.8\n\n+\n\n3B\n\n0.6\n\n3A\n\n0.4\n\nCF\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0.2\n\n3D\n10\n\n20\nNH (1022 cm\u22122)\n\n30\n\n40\n\nFigure 7.

Labels refer to the intervals as defined in Fig. 3 and 4.\n\nters is not severe, and that the single-parameter errors used\nin this work are representative of the real uncertainties.\nAt a more speculative level, we notice that the intrinsic\ncontinuum flux during the third eclipse is anticorrelated with\nNH and CF . This may be a simple coincidence, given the\nstrong and fast intrinsic variability of this source (Fig. 1),\nor otherwise it could be the indication of the presence of a\nCompton-thick core in the cloud. The effect of this component would be to decrease the observed flux, with no significant change in the spectral shape (except for a small\nflattening of the total spectrum, due to the higher fraction\nof reflected continuum). The possible Compton-thick core is\nalso indicated in Fig. 6 with a question mark.\n\n3.3\n\nA general picture of the circumnuclear\nmedium\n\nThe above analysis shows that, within the adopted scenario,\nwe can infer several physical and geometrical properties of\nthe eclipsing clouds. Here we discuss a general view of the\ncircumnuclear region of Mrk 766 accounting for the observed\noccultations.\nThe main point that we want to stress is that the observed clouds are not expected to be \"average\" Broad Line\n\n9\n\nRegion clouds. Mrk 766 is a well known Narrow-Line Seyfert\n1, with optical line widths of the order of 1,100 km s\u22121\n(Grupe et al. 2004) centered at the rest-frame line energies,\nand on average with no absorption along the line of sight.\nThis is also the case for the observation discussed here: the\nsource remains completely unobscured for \u223c80% of the time.\nThe scenario we propose is described in Fig. 6: the \"average\" broad line clouds form a toroidal structure around the\ncentral source. The clouds responsible of our occultations\nare out of the main distribution, probably driven by radiation pressure from the central accretion disc. The proposed\nstructure is in agreement with wind-torus models such as in\nElvis (2000), Proga et al. (2000) or Risaliti & Elvis (2009),\nwhere a small part of the circumnuclear gas is accelerated\nat outflowing velocities of the order of those observed here,\nin a nearly radial direction, while most of the gas falls down\ninto the disk, forming a toroidal stucture. The simulations in\nProga et al. (2000) show a large range in density (and therefore in ionization) inside the wind region. Since in Mrk 766\nwe are not observing a constant wind, it is possible that the\nobserved clouds are \"outliers\" slightly scattered out with\nrespect to the main wind stream.\nThe clouds detected in Mrk 766 are completely different\nfrom the ones analyzed in a recent Suzaku observation of\nNGC 1365 (Maiolino et al. 2010), where we were also able\nto observe comet-shaped clouds: in the case of NGC 1365 the\neclipses are much more common, the motion of the clouds\nis likely dominated by the radial component, and the tails\nlie on the plane of sky. NGC 1365 is a heavily obscured,\noptically type 1.8 source, so we believe that the line of sight\nto the X-ray source is crossed by standard\" clouds lying in\nthe bulk of the toroidal Broad Line Region.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a time-resolved spectral analysis of\na long XMM-Newton observation of the NLS1 galaxy\nMrk 766, suggesting the presence of three occultation\nevents due to three different clouds crossing the line of\nsight. Within this scheme, the spectral analysis of the\nsingle intervals revealed important features of the absorber\nstructure:\n1) The obscuring clouds have neautral cores with column\ndensities of a few 1023 cm\u22122 , density of 1010 \u2212 1011 cm\u22123 ,\nand linear dimensions of the order of 1012 -1013 cm. The\nX-ray source has a similar size, corresponding to a few\ngravitational radii for the estimated black hole mass of\nMrk 766 of 1.8\u00d7106 M\u2299 .\n2) The detection of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines\nduring all the three occultations suggests the presence of\nhighly ionized cloud tails, outflowing with velocities from\n3,000 to 15,000 km s\u22121 .\nOur analysis shows that occultation events, already observed in several obscured AGN, can happen also in type 1\nobjects, which are on average unobscured. When this happens, allowing for possible absorption variability is crucial\nboth to obtain information on the structure of the X-ray absorber (and of the broad emission line clouds) and to perform\na correct estimate of the parameters of the X-ray spectrum.\nWe are currently expanding our time-resolved analysis\n\n\f10\n\nG. Risaliti et al.\n\nto several tens of long archival observations of bright AGNs,\nwith the aim of increasing the statistics on X-ray occultation events, and building a well defined sample in order to\nestimate the frequency of such \"black hole eclipses\".\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been funded by NASA Grant NNX07AR90G.\n\nREFERENCES\nBentz M.
