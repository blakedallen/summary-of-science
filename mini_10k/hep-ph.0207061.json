In this respect the factorization\nansatz, that allows a treatment of nonleptonic decay amplitudes by factorizing hadronic\nmatrix elements of four-quark operators as products of two current matrix elements, has\nbeen a widely used working tool for the analysis of B decays to charmed and charmless\nhadrons in the final state. In those decays in which the effective Wilson coefficients are\nnot colour suppressed and the tree-level (V \u2212 A) \u00d7 (V \u2212 A) current matrix elements do\nnot vanish, it is found that factorization provides a reasonable description of data [1].\nHowever, the recent observation of the decay mode B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 , reported by the Belle\nCollaboration together with the measurement of the branching fraction [2]:\n\u22124\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 ) = (6.0+2.1\n,\n\u22121.8 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\n\n(1)\n\ndemonstrates the inadeguacy of the factorization model in the calculation of nonleptonic\nB decay amplitudes for colour suppressed B to charmonium transitions. A large nonfactorizable term is needed to account for the observed branching ratio. As a matter of\nfact, the result (1) implies that the rate of B decays into a kaon and the 0++ state of the\ncharmonium system, \u03c7c0 , is comparable with the B decay rate into a kaon and J/\u03c8, and\nindeed the measurement of the ratio of the two branching fractions, reported by the same\nCollaboration, is:\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 )\n= (0.60+0.21\n\u22120.18 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1 0.08) .\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8)\n\n(2)\n\nThe experimental results (1) and (2) are in conflict with the vanishing of the amplitude\nof B \u2192 K\u03c7c0 computed by the factorization ansatz, while the amplitude governing B \u2192\nKJ/\u03c8 is different from zero in the same approximation. This can be easily shown: the\neffective Hamiltonian governing both the transitions 1 :\nGF\nHW = \u221a\n2\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\nVcb Vcs\u2217 c1 (\u03bc)O1 (\u03bc) + c2 (\u03bc)O2 (\u03bc)\n\n\u2212 Vtb Vts\u2217\n\nX\n\no\n\nci (\u03bc)Oi (\u03bc) + h.c.\n\ni\n\n\u0011\n\ninvolves only vector and axial-vector c\u0304c operators:\n\n1\n\nO1 = (c\u0304b)V \u2212A (s\u0304c)V \u2212A\n\nWe neglect the B \u2212 annihilation transition, which is governed by the CKM matrix element Vub .\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fO2 = (s\u0304b)V \u2212A (c\u0304c)V \u2212A\nO3(5) = (s\u0304b)V \u2212A\n\nX\nq\n\nO4(6) = (s\u0304i bj )V \u2212A\n\n(q\u0304q)V \u2212A[V +A]\n\nX\nq\n\n(q\u0304j qi )V \u2212A[V +A]\n\n(4)\n\nX\n3\n(s\u0304b)V \u2212A\neq (q\u0304q)V +A[V \u2212A]\n2\nq\nX\n3\n(s\u0304i bj )V \u2212A\neq (q\u0304j qi )V +A[V \u2212A]\n=\n2\nq\n\nO7(9) =\nO8(10)\n\n(i, j are color indices and (q\u0304q)V \u2213A = q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2213 \u03b35 )q), and therefore the factorized amplitude\ni\nh\nX\nGF\nAF (B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 ) = \u221a Vcb Vcs\u2217 a2 +\nai hK \u2212 |(s\u0304b)V \u2212A |B \u2212 ih\u03c7c0|(c\u0304c)V \u2213A |0i\n2\ni=3,5,7,9\n\n(5)\n\nvanishes since the current matrix elements h\u03c7c0|(c\u0304c)V,A |0i are zero. Instead, the experi-\n\nmental result (1) corresponds to Aexp(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 ) = (3.39 \u00b1 0.68) \u00d7 10\u22127 GeV. On the\nother hand in the case of B \u2192 KJ/\u03c8, since hJ/\u03c8|(c\u0304c)V |0i =\n6 0, a nonvanishing factorized\namplitude, analogous to (5), can be obtained once the combinations of Wilson coefficients\na2 = c2 + c1 /Nc and ai = ci + ci+1 /Nc ,2 and the matrix element hK \u2212 |(s\u0304b)V \u2212A |B \u2212 i are\nprovided.\nCorrections to naive factorization involve gluon exchanges between the charmonium\nsystem and the quarks in B and K mesons. For a class of nonleptonic B \u2192 M1 M2 decays\n\nit has been argued that, in the large mb limit, non factorizable corrections are dominated\nby hard (perturbatively calculable) gluon exchanges, while soft effects are confined to the\n(B, M1 ) system, where M1 is the meson picking up the spectator quark in B decay. This is\nthe case of several processes where M1 and M2 are light mesons. However, when the meson\nwhich does not pick up the spectator quark is heavy, such a result no longer holds [3]. In\norder to apply the QCD-improved factorization model to B decays to charmonium plus\na kaon, either the cc\u0304 state should be considered light with respect to the B meson, or one\nhas to invoke the small transverse size of the c\u0304c system in order to assume a tiny overlap\nof the quarkonium wave function with the kaon wave function. However, an analysis\nof non factorizable corrections due to hard gluon exchanges in B \u2192 K\u03c7c0 has revealed\nthe presence of infrared singularities, showing a difficulty of the method when applied to\nthis decay mode [4]. In the present note we investigate another effect, namely the K\u03c7c0\nproduction by rescattering of open charm mesons Ds(\u2217) D (\u2217) etc. primarily produced in B \u2212\ndecays. The corresponding amplitude is mainly obtained by the operators O1 and O2 in\n2\n\nThe definition of a7 and a9 includes a factor e.\n\n3\n\n\f(3), and therefore this process could produce a sizeable contribution to B \u2192 K\u03c7c0 owing\nto the relatively large values of the corresponding Wilson coefficients c1 and c2 . Analogous\neffects were investigated in [5], and have recently received new attention [6, 7].\nRescattering of intermediate Ds(\u2217) D (\u2217) mesons can also contribute to the transition\nB \u2192 KJ/\u03c8 and therefore we also consider this decay mode. Our conclusion is that,\nalthough the calculation presents uncertainties the size of which we shall try to assess,\nrescattering effects represent a non-negligible contribution to the decay channels B \u2212 \u2192\n\nK \u2212 \u03c7c0 and B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8.\n\nProcess B \u2212 \u2192 Ds(\u2217)\u2212D (\u2217)0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0\n\n2\n\nIn the charm sector, rescattering effects have been recognized as a source of sizeable\ncontributions in hadronic D meson decays. As the mass of the decaying B meson is\nlarger than the D meson mass, one could suppose a minor role of such processes in B\ntransitions, since one naively expects that high momentum final state particles move fast\naway from the interaction region without having the possibility to rescatter [8]. However,\nin a number of analyses it has been shown that rescattering effects can play an important\nrole even in B decays [9, 10, 11, 12].\nIt is worth attempting an estimate of the size of rescattering effects in color-suppressed\nB decays to final states containing heavy particles. We concentrate on two-body charmed\nmeson contributions 3 , which can be included through a number of dynamical assumptions.\nWe consider a set of amplitudes corresponding to the diagrams in fig.1, that represent\nt-channel contributions to the final state interaction.

These\nterms are suppressed by smaller values of the universal form factors and of the leptonic\ndecay constants; therefore, the amplitudes in fig.1 represent the main contributions that\nneed to be analyzed.\n\n3\n\nMode B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212J/\u03c8\n\nBefore attempting a numerical estimate of the amplitudes in fig.1, let us consider the\ndecay mode B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8. In this case the amplitude obtained in the naive factorization\napproach, keeping only the contribution of the operators O1 and O2 in (3), is given by\nGF\nAF (B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8) = 2 \u221a Vcb Vcs\u2217 a2 fJ/\u03c8 mJ/\u03c8 F1BK (m2J/\u03c8 )(\u01eb\u2217 * q)\n2\n= \u00c3F (\u01eb\u2217 * q) ,\n8\n\n(23)\n\n\fwith the constant fJ/\u03c8 defined by\nh0|c\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc c|J/\u03c8(p\u2032, \u01eb)i = fJ/\u03c8 mJ/\u03c8 \u01eb\u03bc ,\n\n(24)\n\n\u01eb the J/\u03c8 polarization vector, q the kaon momentum and F1BK one of the two form factors\nparameterizing the matrix element hK \u2212 |s\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc b|B \u2212 i.\nIdentifying eq.(23) with the experimental amplitude obtained from the measurement\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8) = (1.00 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10\u22123 [18]: \u00c3exp = (1.41 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u22127 , and using the\n\nvalue fJ/\u03c8 = 405 \u00b1 14 MeV, one obtains a result for the product |a2 F1BK (m2J/\u03c8 )|. This\ndetermination of a2 is mainly affected by the uncertainty on F1BK ; scanning several form\nfactor models, as done in [19], one gets |a2 | = 0.2 \u2212 0.4, while considering the calculation\nin [20] one obtains |a2 | = 0.38 \u00b1 0.05. Such results are obtained using Vcb = 0.040 and\nVcs = 0.9735 that correspond to the central values reported by the Particle Data Group\n[18].\nAs discussed at length in the literature, the above values of a2 are different from the\ncombination a2 = c2 +c1 /Nc of the Wilson coefficients in (3). As a matter of fact, from the\nvalues c1 = 1.085(1.109) and c2 = \u22120.198(\u22120.243) computed for mb (mb ) = 4.4 GeV and\n(5)\n\u039bM S = 290 MeV in the naive dimensional regularization (or 't Hooft-Veltman) scheme\n[21], one would get: a2 = 0.163(0.126). 4\nTherefore, nonfactorizable effects are sizeable in B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8, and indeed in a\ngeneralized factorization ansatz a2 is treated as an effective parameter used to fit the\ndata. The calculation in the framework of QCD factorization does not allow to reproduce\nthe fitted value, although an improvement towards the experimental datum is obtained\n[22]. It is worth considering rescattering contributions of intermediate charm mesons,\ndescribed by diagrams as depicted in fig.2. The hadronic information for determining\nsuch amplitudes are the same as in Section 2, with the only difference in the strong\nD (\u2217) D (\u2217) J/\u03c8 couplings that can be expressed in terms of the parameter fJ/\u03c8 , using the\nsame vector meson dominance method applied to derive eq.

This value is in the upper side of several theoretical calculations [24, 25].\nWe choose to be conservative, and vary this parameter in the range: 0.35 < g < 0.65 that\n\nencompasses the largest part of the predictions.\nWe use the expression (18) for the D (\u2217) D (\u2217) \u03c7c0 vertices, with f\u03c7c0 = 510 \u00b1 40 MeV obtained by a standard two-point QCD sum rule analysis. As for the couplings D (\u2217) D (\u2217) J/\u03c8,\nexpressions analogous to (18) involve fJ/\u03c8 , for which we use the experimental measurement. To account for the off-shell effects of the D (\u2217) exchanged particles, we use eq.(19)\nwith two choices for the parameters: \u039bi = 2.5 GeV and \u039bi = 2.8 GeV , corresponding\nto typical values of the mass of the radial excitations of D (\u2217) mesons.\nThe results are reported in Table 1. One has to notice that the rescattering amplitudes\ncontribute with different signs to the final result, with significant cancellations among the\nvarious terms.\nA few observations are in order. First, in the chosen range of values for the vari10\n\n\fTable 1: Numerical results for the rescattering amplitudes\nB \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0\nB \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8\n\nReA (GeV)\n\u2212(0.9 \u2212 1.7) \u00d7 10\u22127\n\u2212(1.4 \u2212 2.7) \u00d7 10\u22127\nRe\u00c3\n(0.1 \u2212 0.2) \u00d7 10\u22127\n(0.2 \u2212 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22127\n\nImA (GeV)\n\u2212(0.5 \u2212 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22127\n\u2212(0.6 \u2212 1.2) \u00d7 10\u22127\nIm\u00c3\n\u2212(0.5 \u2212 0.9) \u00d7 10\u22127\n\u2212(0.9 \u2212 1.7) \u00d7 10\u22127\n\n\u039bi (GeV)\n2.5\n2.8\n\u039bi (GeV)\n2.5\n2.8\n\nous parameters, the rescattering amplitudes are sizeable, and become comparable to the\nexperimental ones. This observation can be made more quantitative. Assuming that\nthe amplitude relative to B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8 deviates from the factorized result because of\nthe contribution of the rescattering term: \u00c3exp = \u00c3f act + \u00c3resc, one can constrain the\n\nvalues of \u039bi for the calculation of B(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 ). One obtains: \u039bi \u2243 2.7 GeV and\nB(B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 ) = (1.1\u22123.5)\u00d710\u22124 , to be compared to (1). The result seems noticeable,\nconsidering the rather schematic description of the rescattering process.\nThe second observation is that a correspondence similar to that between B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0\n\nand B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8 is expected with analogous decay modes, namely B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c1\nand B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c2 , the mesons \u03c7c1,2 being the axial vector and the tensor states of the\n\ncharmonium system. It is worth observing that B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c2 is another process the\namplitude of which vanishes in the naive factorization model; in our approach, we expect\na branching fraction analogous to that of B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 .\n\nWe are aware of the various sources of theoretical uncertainty. The uncertainty related\nto the B \u2212 \u2192 Ds(\u2217) D (\u2217) vertices can be minimized gaining experimental information on\nthese decay modes. The uncertainties in the strong vertices can be reduced by dedicated\nanalyses using nonperturbative QCD methods (QCD sum rules or lattice QCD). However,\n\nall such uncertainties only affect the precise numerical predictions and not our main\nconclusion. We have found that rescattering amplitudes, describing a rearrangement of\nthe quarks in the final state after the production of pairs of charmed mesons, not only\ncannot be neglected both in B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c0 , both in B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8, but can provide a\nlarge part of the decay amplitudes. Analogous effects are expected to be important in\nsimilar colour suppressed decay modes, namely B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c1 and B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c7c2 .\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For a review see: M.
