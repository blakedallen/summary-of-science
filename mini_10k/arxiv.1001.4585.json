The proposal is very interesting in the following two aspects. In the first place, with\nthe assumption of the entropic force together with the\nUnruh temperature [2], Verlinde is able to derive the second law of Newtonian mechanics. Secondly, the assumption of the entropic force together with the holographic\nprinciple [3] and the equipartition law of energy can lead\nto the Newtonian law of gravitation. Similar discoveries are also made by Padmanabhan [4]. Padmanabhan\nfinds that using the equipartition law of energy for the\nhorizon and the thermodynamic relation S = E/2T , one\ncan obtain the Newtonian law of gravity. Here S and T\nare thermodynamic entropy and the temperature associated with the horizon. E is the active gravitational mass\nwhich produces the gravitational field in the spacetime\n[5]. Actually, Jacobson has derived the Einstein's equations by employing the Clausius relation and the equivalence principle in 1995 [6].\nUsing the entropic force, Shu and Gong [7], Cai, Cao\nand Ohta [8] derived the Friedmann equation nearly simultaneously while with different methods. On the other\nhand, using this entropic force, Smolin [9] derived the\nNewtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity. M\u00e4kel\u00e4 [10]\npointed out that Verlinde's entropic force is actually the\nconsequence of a specific microscopic model of spacetime\n[11]. Similar ideas were applied to the construction of\n\nholographic actions from black hole entropy by Caravelli\nand Modesto [12] . Li and Wang [13] showed that the\nholographic dark energy [14] can be derived from the entropic force formula. 1\nWe note that statistical thermodynamics reveals the\nequipartition law of energy does not hold in the very\nlow temperatures. It is found the Debye model is very\nsuccessful in explaining the experimental results for most\nof the solid objects. In particular, many experiments on\nDebye model indicate that the lower the temperature,\nthe better the consistency is.\nOn the other hand, the quantum theory of black holes\nfinds black holes satisfy the first law of thermodynamics [15]. Furthermore, the Unruh effect indicates that a\ngravitational field corresponds a thermal bath with temperature of T . So every gravitational system may be\nphysically corresponding to a statistical thermodynamics\nsystem. Since the equipartition law of energy does not\nhold in low temperatures for thermodynamic system, we\nanticipate the entropic force formula should be modified\nfor the very weak gravitational fields.\nActually, the strength of gravitational fields are 101 N*\nkg\u22121 on the earth, 10\u22124 N * kg\u22121 for the solar system (felt\nby the Neptune) and 10\u221210 N * kg\u22121 for the Galaxy (felt\nby the Sun). In one word, the strength of gravitational\nfield becomes smaller and smaller with the increasing of\nscales. Therefore, it may be plausible that the entropic\nforce (or Newtonian gravity) takes a different form in the\nbackground of an extreme weak gravitational field.\nIn this paper, motivated by the Debye's model in ther-\n\n1\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: gaocj@bao.ac.cn\n\nSame observation was disclosed by Johannes Koelman in his blog.\n(see http://www.scientificblogging.com-hammock physicist-it bit\nhow get rid dark energy)\n\n\f2\nmodynamics, we extend the entropic force formula. With\nthis modification, we find the resulting entropic force can\nspeed up the expansion of the Universe. We shall use the\nsystem of units with G = c = ~ = k = 1 and the metric\nsignature (\u2212, +, +, +) throughout the paper.\nII.\n\nwhere the Debye function is defined by\nZ x\ny3\n3\ndy .\nD (x) \u2261 3\nx 0 ey \u2212 1\nx is related to the temperature T as follows:\nx\u2261\n\nMODIFIED ENTROPIC FORCE\n\nFollowing [1], we consider a compact spatial region V\nwith a compact boundary B which is a sphere. The compact boundary B plays the role of a holographic screen.\nThe number N of bits for freedom on the screen is taken\nto be equal to the area A of the screen:\nN =A.\n\ng\nT =\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\n1\nNT .\n2\n\ng\n1\n* 4\u03c0r2 *\n,\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nnamely,\nM\ng= 2 .\nr\n\n(6)\n\nIt is exactly the Newtonian law of gravity. Statistical\nthermodynamics tells us the equipartition law of energy\nfails in the very low temperatures. It is found the Debye\nmodel is very successful for most of solid objects. Since a\ngravitational system may be physically corresponding to\na statistical thermodynamics system and the strength of\ngravitational field becomes smaller and smaller with the\nincreasing of cosmic scales, we anticipate the Newtonian\ngravity may be modified on the very large scale of the\nUniverse.\nMotivated by this point, we modify the equipartition\nlaw of energy as follows:\nE=\n\n1\nN T D (x) ,\n2\n\nM\n1\n*\n,\n2\nr\nD (x)\n\n(10)\n\ngD\n.\ng\n\n(11)\n\nwith\nx\u2261\n\nThe Debye acceleration is related to the Debye temperature\n\n(7)\n\n(12)\n\nWe note that when x \u226a 1, i.e. in the limit of strong\ngravitational field, we have\nD (x) = 1 .\n\n(13)\n\nSo the Newtonian gravity is recovered. On the other\nhand, in the limit of weak gravitational field, i.e, x \u226b 1,\nwe have\n\n(4)\n\nCombining above equations, we can obtain the spherically symmetric and static gravitational field equations:\nM=\n\ng=\n\n(3)\n\nVerlinde assumes the energy is equal to the gravitational\nmass M inside the screen:\nE=M .\n\n(9)\n\ngD = 2\u03c0TD .\n\nSo according to the equipartition law of energy, the total\nenergy inside the screen is\nE=\n\nTD\n.\nT\n\nTD is the Debye critical temperature. For a gravitational\nsystem, TD is related to the critical gravitational acceleration. So we obtain the modified entropic force from\nEq. (7) as follows\n\n(1)\n\nLet g denotes the proper gravitational acceleration on the\nscreen which is produced by the matter sources inside the\nscreen B. Then the Unruh effect tells us the gravitational\nfield would correspond to a system filled with thermal gas\nwith the temperature of T for a proper observer:\n\n(8)\n\nD (x) =\n\n\u03c04\n,\n5x3\n\n(14)\n\n\u0013 41\n\n(15)\n\nand\ng=\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n5M gD\n\u03c04\n\n1\n*\u221a .\nr\n\nIn this limit, the gravitational field is very different from\nNewtonian gravity. In the next, let's look for the value\nof gD from the considerations of cosmological physics.\nUsing the method of Shu and Gong [7], we obtain the\nfollowing equation\n\u0015\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0012\n3x\nK\n. (16)\n\u22122D (x) + x\n4\u03c0 (\u03c1 + p) = \u2212 \u1e22 \u2212 2\na\ne \u22121\nHere \u03c1, p are the total energy density and total pressure\nof cosmic fluids, respectively. a, H are the scale factor\nand Hubble parameter, respectively. K = 0, +1, \u22121\ndescribe the three kind of geometry of the Universe. Dot\ndenotes the derivative with respect to the comic time t.\nTaking into account the Hawking temperature T for the\nUniverse [16, 17]\nT =\n\nH\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(17)\n\n\f3\nwe find x can be rewritten as\nHD\n.\nH\n\n(18)\n\n2.5\n\nThus the critical Hubble parameter HD is exactly the\nDebye acceleration gD :\n\n2\n\nx\u2261\n\nHD = g D .\n\nh\n1.5\n\n(19)\n1\n\nEq. (16) together with the energy conservation equation\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H (\u03c1 + p) = 0 ,\n\n(20)\n\ngovern the evolution of the Universe. Using these two\nequations, we find the current cosmic acceleration can\nbe interpreted while without invoking any kind of dark\nenergy. To show this point, we may investigate the cosmic evolution sourced by dark matter and baryon matter. Observations reveal that the Universe is highly flat\nin space. So in the following we shall put K = 0.

The\nstandard cosmological model, e.g. as in Komatsu et al.\n[18], predicts a present matter density ratio \u03a9m0 = 0.25.\nUsing this result and taking \u03b6 = 10\u22125 , we plot the dimensionless Hubble parameter h via redshifts z in Fig. 1\nfor our model and the standard \u039bCDM model. We find\nthey have nearly the same behavior.\nIn order to show our model can lead to the cosmic acceleration, we plot the evolution of deceleration parameter q:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd ln h\n,\n(26)\nq \u2261\u2212 1+\ndu\nin Fig. 2.

The\nsolid line is for the standard \u039bCDM model. The circled line\nis for our model.\n\nAt higher redshifts (large H), we have x \u226a 1. Then\nEq. (16) restores to the standard equation in General\nRelativity. So the physics at and before the radiation\ndominated epoch is not modified. Finally, let's calculate\nthe Debye acceleration gD :\ngD = \u03b6H0 = 10\u221215 N * kg\u22121 .\n\n(27)\n\nIt is the order of 10\u221211 of the gravitational field strength\nin the solar system and the order of 10\u22125 for the Galaxy\nsystem. So Eq. (10) can be perfectly written as the Newtonian law of gravity in the solar system and the Galaxy\nscales. To show this point in great detail, we may observe\nthe modified Poisson's equation which is given by:\n\u2207 * [D (x) \u2207\u03a6] = 4\u03c0\u03c1 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwith\nx=\n\ngD\n.\n|\u2207\u03a6|\n\n(29)\n\nHere \u03c1 is the energy density of matter sources. \u03a6 is the\nNewtonian gravitational potential. When x \u226a 1, i.e. in\nthe limit of strong gravitational field, we have D = 1\nwhich is for the Newtonian gravity. So the deviation\n\n\f4\n\n1\n\n0.9999\n\n0.9998\n\n0.9997\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFIG. 3: The values of Debye function D with the strength of\ngravitational field log (|\u2207\u03c6|/gD ) in Galaxy.\n\nof Eq.

The strength of gravitational field\nin the Galaxy is around the order of 105 of the Debye\nacceleration gD . It then follows that the Debye function\nD \u2243 1 in the Galaxy such that the Newtonian gravity\nemerges as a very good approximation.\n\nnamical system, we expect the equipartition law of energy\nfor gravitational system shall break down in the limit\nof very low temperature (or very low gravitational field\nstrength). Motivated by Debye model, we modified the\nentropic force. We find the modification can interpret\nthe current acceleration of the Universe while without\ninvoking any kind of dark energy.\nThe model is closely related the Debye acceleration gD .\nWe find gD = 10\u221215 N * kg\u22121 is consistent with cosmic observations very well. This gravitational field strength is\nvery much smaller than the gravitational fields, by orders\nof 1011 in solar system and by orders of 105 in the Galaxy.\nTherefore, the modified entropic force is not inconsistent\nwith the solar system tests and the Galaxy scale observations. Then how to derive the Debye model from the\nspecific microscopic model of spacetime? We leave this\nproblem to future study.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nStatistical thermodynamics tells us the equipartition\nlaw of energy does not hold in the limit of temperature\napproaching zero. It is found that the Debye model is\nvery successful in interpreting the physics of very low\ntemperature system for most of the solid objects. Since\na gravitational system can also be taken as a thermody-\n\nI am grateful to the referees for the insightful comments and suggestions, which have allowed me to improve this paper significantly.
