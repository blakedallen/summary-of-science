It\nis shown that a new cooling channel is opened, and what is more, all previously known channels\nacquire greater emissivity reaching the level of the direct URCA cycle in normal matter.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNeutral kaon (K\u0304 0 ) condensation treated jointly with K \u2212 condensation has been considered lately by some authors\n[1, 2]. They paid attention mainly to how the extension to the K\u0304 0 condensate alters the Equation of State and the\ncomposition of dense matter. Matter composition is a highly important issue for neutron star cooling during the\nfirst few million years after the neutron star's birth. In this period of a star's life, it is mainly cooled by neutrino\nemission from the dense core of the star. Generally, the presence of negative boson condensate makes matter more\nisospin-symmetric with the proton fraction increasing quickly with density easily exceeding the threshold value for the\ndirect URCA cycle [3], which is the most effective mechanism of cooling in the dense interior of a neutron star. Thus,\nin this way kaon condensation favors fast cooling of neutron stars. But this conclusion should be taken carefully. It\nwas shown in [4] that for some class of nuclear models, negative kaons become so much abundant that very high proton\nfraction is required to maintain the matter neutrality. For very high proton fraction the direct URCA cycle is blocked\nagain. However, in the matter with kaon condensate, beside the direct URCA cycle, another type of reactions is\npermissible. It comes from the fact that the properties of nucleons in a dense medium change when kaon condensate\nis formed. Nucleons appear to be dressed by kaons and become linear combination of vacuum states [5, 6]\n\u00f1 = u n + v p\np\u0303 = \u2212v\u0304 n + \u016b p ,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere u and v depend on the condensate amplitude and obey usual unitarity condition: u\u016b+vv\u0304 = 1. When condensate\nvanishes hKi \u2192 0 the coefficients recover the pure nucleons, e.i. u \u2192 1, v \u2192 0. Such quasi-particles cease to be the\neigenstate of charge. Hence, besides the usual direct URCA process (dURCA) which corresponds to the neutron decay\nand its inversion, other reactions are also possible between nucleons dressed with kaons (kURCA):\ndURCA \u00f1 \u2194 p\u0303 + l + \u03bdl\n\nkURCA\n\n\u00f1 \u2194 \u00f1 + l + \u03bdl\np\u0303 \u2194 p\u0303 + l + \u03bdl .\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFor the kURCA processes it is easier to fulfill the kinematic condition (triangle condition) concerning the nucleon and\nlepton Fermi momenta. It may be shown that independently of the value of the proton fraction, even for almost pure\nneutron star matter, where x \u2248 0, at least one of the above reactions takes place. However, the emissivities I of the\nthree channels are not the same. Roughly speaking, they may be classified by means of the Cabibbo angle \u03b8C [6]:\nIdURCA \u223c cos2 \u03b8C\n\nIkURCA \u223c sin2 \u03b8C\n\n(5)\n\nThe emissivity in the dURCA cycle is proportional to cos2 \u03b8C , whereas that for kURCA \u2013 to sin2 \u03b8C , which means\nthat the kURCA branch is about two orders of magnitude less effective than the dURCA branch. In order to obtain\nthe value of neutrino emissivity, a concrete model of strong interaction must be used. As it was already mentioned\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: sebastian.kubis@ifj.edu.pl\n\n\f2\nthere are models of K \u2212 condensation for which dURCA is switched off, and only less effective kURCA may cool the\nmatter.\nAn interesting question is to what extent the picture changes with the inclusion of the K\u0304 0 condensate. Such a\ncomponent seems to be exotic but as it was shown by Pal et.al. in [1] that it is quite plausible to consider the matter\nwith both K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 . The addition of K\u0304 0 presence to the model does not require additional parameters because\nthe form of K\u0304 0 N couplings comes from the symmetry considerations and we need only to know the K \u2212 N coupling\nconstant. That is important because the constant is not well determined quantity and we would like to avoid any\nfurther uncertainty. The critical density for K\u0304 0 condensation is always higher than that one for K \u2212 . This comes\nfrom the fact that the K\u0304 0 effective mass must drop to 0, whereas the K \u2212 effective mass should drop down only\nto the electron chemical potential. Pal et.al. calculate the critical density for kaon condensation which is between\n(2 \u2212 3.5)n0 for K \u2212 and (3 \u2212 5)n0 for K\u0304 0 , where the uncertainty comes just from the not well known kaon-nucleon\ncoupling strength. After K\u0304 0 appearance both condensates may coexist because such a state lowers the total energy\nof the system. This also makes the Equation of State slightly softer than in the pure K \u2212 case. The [1] authors also\nconsidered several different parameterizations of the nuclear models (with different stiffness) and showed that critical\ndensity for K\u0304 0 production is available in the center of a neutron star with realistic mass. Even if the central part\nof the star with K\u0304 0 is very tiny it could have dramatic consequences for cooling scenario. Page and Applegate have\nshown in [7] that even if the central kernel, where the direct URCA process is allowed, occupies only a few percent\nof the total mass, it cools the star in the same rate as it would comprise more than half of the total mass. One may\nsay that if only central density of a star exceeds the threshold value for direct URCA, the star is cooled according\nto the fast scenario in which it reaches the temperature around 105 K on the scale 102 years, instead of 106 years\nfor the slow cooling driven by modified URCA processes. So, it is important to see whether the K\u0304 0 presence leads\nto the fast neutrino cooling or not. In this work, we focus on the details of weak interactions in the matter with\nkaon condensate, and show that the inclusion of K\u0304 0 condensation leads to such a mixing between quasi-nucleons that\nremoves the difference between the dURCA and the kURCA cycles, placing them on the same footing.\nAt the end of this section we wold like to refer to the issue of presence of hyperons in neutron star matter. In general,\nthe kaon condensation should be considered in common with hyperons. Hyperons appears at lower density then the\nthreshold for K \u2212 condensation and may move it up to higher densities even to completely block the production of\nkaons for some sets of model parameters [8, 9]. The same behavior of the threshold density was observed in the K\u0304 0\ncase by Banik et.al. in [2]. Axial coupling of kaons and hyperons opens possibility of p-wave condensation [10] and\ncertainly affects the URCA cycles by introducing momentum dependence into the expression for neutrino emissivity,\nsimilarly as in the pion condensation case [5]. However, hyperonic star become more and more arguable in the light of\nthe recent observations of massive neutron stars in X-ray binary systems [11] and lately also for radio pulsar [12] which\nsuggest masses above 2M\u2299 . Different models, those based on hypernuclear observables [14, 15] or those on relativistic\nmean field theory [9, 13] conclude that maximal mass does not exceed 1.8M\u2299 . One may notice that hyperons make\nthe Equation of State much softer from very fundamental reasons. Their production creates additional baryonic Fermi\nseas and lowers neutron chemical potential \u03bcn which contributes directly to the pressure: P = \u2212\u03b5 + \u03bcn nB , where\n\u03b5 is the energy density and nB is baryon number density. Kaons also make the EOS softer but the scale of this\neffect is model dependent and we have some freedom to avoid too soft EOS. The kaon condensate has zero pressure\nand may modify the stiffness of EOS only indirectly through effective masses of nucleons or lepton abundance, so\nvarious details of the model are relevant. Nevertheless, the total effect mainly depends on the kaon-nucleon coupling,\nand previous works have shown that the matter with charged kaons [9, 16] and with neutral kaons [1] is still able to\nsupport neutron star mass above 2M\u2299 being in agreement with observations.\nII.\n\nCHIRAL MODEL AND WEAK NUCLEAR CURRENTS\n\nIn the context of kaon condensation, the SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R chiral model proposed by Kaplan and Nelson [17] is\ncommonly used. The current algebra is naturally built-in into this model, so it may be used to find the form of\nhadronic currents needed to get the matrix elements for semileptonic reactions in the presence of the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0\ncondensates. The chirally symmetric part takes the following form:\nL\u03c7 =\n\nf2\nTr\u2202\u03bc U \u2202 \u03bc U + + TrB\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u2212 mB )B\n4\n+ F TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 [A\u03bc , B] + D TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 {A\u03bc , B}.\n\n(6)\n\nMesons are represented by the matrix\n\u221a M\nU = \u03be 2 = exp(i 2 ) ,\nf\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nwhere M and B include meson and baryon octet (for notation details, see [18]):\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nM =\uf8ed\n\n+ \u221a16 \u03b78\n\u03c0+\n\u03c0\u2212\n\u2212 \u221a12 \u03c0 0 +\n\n\u221a1 \u03c0 0\n2\n\nK\n\n\u2212\n\nK\u0304\n\n0\n\n\u221a1 \u03b78\n6\n\n\uf8f6\nK+\nK0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nq\n\u2212 23 \u03b78\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nB=\uf8ed\n\n\u221a1 \u03a30\n2\n\n+\n\u03a3\u2212\n\n\u221a1 \u039b\n6\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03a3+\n\u2212 \u221a12 \u03a30 +\n\n\u039e\n\n0\n\n\u039e\n\n\u221a1 \u039b\n6\n\n\u2212\n\np\nn\nq\n\n\uf8f6\n2\n3\u039b\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nIn order to get proper expressions for beta-type transitions for nucleons in the presence of K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 , one needs to\nknow the conserved currents coming from the Lagrangian (6). They may be found by employing the Noether theorem\nto the chiral transformation U \u2192 LU R+ , \u03be \u2192 L\u03beh+ = h\u03beR+ , B \u2192 hBh+ where L, R and h are SU (3) matrices.\nIt is convenient to decompose the currents into two parts: purely mesonic and baryonic, where the latter contains\nbaryons coupled to meson fields:\n\u03bc\nV \u03bc = VM\n+ VB\u03bc\n\nA\u03bc = A\u03bcM + A\u03bcB\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\u03bc\nVM,a\n= \u2212i\n\nf2\nTr\u03bba (U + \u2202 \u03bc U + U \u2202 \u03bc U + )\n4\n\n(10)\n\nf2\nTr\u03bba (U + \u2202 \u03bc U \u2212 U \u2202 \u03bc U + )\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\u03bc\nVB,a\n=\n\n1\nF\nD\nTrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc [ua+ , B] + TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 [ua\u2212 , B] + TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 {ua\u2212 , B}\n4\n4\n4\n\n(12)\n\nA\u03bcB,a =\n\nF\nD\n1\nTrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc [ua\u2212 , B] + TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 [ua+ , B] + TrB\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 {ua+ , B}\n4\n4\n4\n\n(13)\n\nA\u03bcM,a = i\n\nwhere ua\u00b1 = \u03be + \u03bba \u03be \u00b1 \u03be\u03bba \u03be + . The expression for axial mesonic current A\u03bcM allows one to identify the parameter f\nwith the pion decay constant f\u03c0 , whereas the baryonic part is relevant for semileptonic decays of baryons. The above\nformulae are similar in their form to the weak nuclear currents presented in [19] for the SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) chiral model.\nThe ground state of matter with kaon condensate is described by Fermi seas of baryons and the non-vanishing\nexpectation value of kaon fields. According to the Baym theorem [20], the kaon mean field acquires time dependence\nf\u03b8\nf\u03c6\nhK \u00b1 i = \u221a exp(\u00b1i\u03bct) hK 0 i = hK\u0304 0 i = \u221a\n2\n2\n\n(14)\n\nrecalling that for neutral kaons, their mean field is independent of time, as the chemical potential for neutral particles\nvanishes. The quantities \u03b8, \u03c6 are non-dimensional condensate amplitudes, useful to parameterize the condensate\nstate. These condensate amplitudes acquire the meaning of rotation angles in chiral space, if, instead of the matrix\nelement hp\u0303, \u03b8, \u03c6|O|\u00f1, \u03b8, \u03c6i of any operator O between quasi-nucleons, one considers hp|U + (\u03b8, \u03c6) O U(\u03b8, \u03c6)|ni \u2013 the\nmatrix element between normal nucleons, but with a rotated O. In this way, for example, the isospin-raising operator\nV1+i2 , relevant for the beta decay, in the condensate state becomes linear combinations of all currents from the octet\nVa , leading to transitions forbidden in the normal state, as reactions shown in (4). In our approach we do not need\nto know the explicit form of the U(\u03b8, \u03c6) because any nuclear current may be find directly by putting expectations\nvalues of kaon fields (14) into equations (12,13). In this derivation, the important quantity is the kaon field matrix \u03be,\nwhich now takes the form\n\uf8eb\n\u03c7\n\u03c7 \uf8f6\n\u03c7\n\u22122 eit\u03bc \u03b8\u03c6 sin2\nieit\u03bc \u03b8\u03c7 sin\n\u03c62 + \u03b82 cos\n2\u03c7\n\u03c74\n\u03c72 \uf8f7\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03b82 + \u03c62 cos\ni\u03c6\u03c7 sin\n\u03be = 2 \uf8ec \u22122 e\u2212it\u03bc \u03b8\u03c6 sin2\n(15)\n\uf8f7,\n4\n2\n2\n\u03c7 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\ni\u03c6\u03c7 sin\n\u03c72 cos\nie\u2212it\u03bc \u03b8\u03c7 sin\n2\n2\n2\nwhere \u03c72 = \u03b82 + \u03c62 . The weak hadronic current J\u03bc has the usual V \u2212A structure, but for the strange particle case,\nbesides the isospin-raising part V1+i2 \u2212A1+i2 , one must include the strangeness-changing part coming from the SU (3)\noctet. Following the Cabibbo theory, the hadronic current is\nJ\u03bc = cos \u03b8C (V1+i2 \u2212 A1+i2 )\u03bc + sin \u03b8C (V4+i5 \u2212 A4+i5 )\u03bc .\n\n(16)\n\n\f4\nThe rate of the reactions which operate in the URCA cycles is described by the baryonic part VB , AB of the total\nSU (3) current (9). Knowing the form of the kaon field matrix \u03be, we may calculate the full octet of currents. Putting\nthem into (16), one gets the weak hadronic current J \u03bc in the presence of the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 condensate\nJ\u03bc =\n\n\u03c7 \u03b82 \u03c62\n\u03c7 \u0003\ncos \u03b8C \b \u03bc \u0002 4\n4\np\u0304\n\u0393\nn\n(\u03b8\n+\n\u03c6\n)\ncos\n+\n(3 + cos )\npn\n\u03c74\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c7\n+ (n\u0304 \u0393\u03bcnn n + p\u0304 \u0393\u03bcpp p) 2\u03b8\u03c6 e\u2212i\u03bct sin2\n4\n\u0001\n\u03c7\n2\n+ n\u0304 \u0393\u03bcnp p 2\u03b8\u03c6 e\u2212i\u03bct sin2\n4\nsin \u03b8C\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\b \u03bc\n2\n2\np\u0304 \u0393\u0303pn n (\u03c6 + \u03b8 cos )i\u03c6\nsin\n\u03c73\n2\n2\n\n(17)\n\n+ (n\u0304 \u0393\u0303\u03bcnn n + p\u0304 \u0393\u0303\u03bcpp p) i\u03b8 e\u2212i\u03bct\n+ n\u0304 \u0393\u0303\u03bcnp p 2ie\u22122i\u03bct \u03b82 \u03c6 sin2\n\n\u03c7\n,\n4\n\nwhere the matrices \u0393ij and \u0393\u0303ij are linear combinations of the Dirac matrices, explicitly given in the Appendix.\nIII.\n\nNEUTRINO EMISSIVITY\n\nAt this point, we are ready to derive the transition rate for beta processes in matter with the K \u2212 , K\u0304 0 condensate.\nBecause the energy of nucleons and leptons is much smaller than the mass of W \u00b1 particles, it is sufficient to use the\nFermi theory of weak interactions, for which the Hamiltonian takes the usual form:\nGF\nHweak = \u221a J\u03bc l\u03bc .\n2\n\n(18)\n\nWhere J \u03bc is hadronic and l\u03bc is leptonic weak current. In the case of charged-kaon (K \u2212 ) condensate only, J \u03bc derived\nin the previous section reduces to simpler form\n\u03bc\nJ\u03c6=0\n= cos \u03b8C p\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 gA \u03b35 )n cos\n\n\u03b8\n2\n\ni\n+ sin \u03b8C [n\u0304\u03b3 (1 + \u2206g \u03b35 )n + 2p\u0304\u03b3 (1\u2212F \u03b35 )p] sin \u03b8\n2\n\u03bc\n\n(19)\n\n\u03bc\n\nwhere gA = D + F and \u2206g = D \u2212 F , and which is equivalent to the results already presented in [21]. Comparing (19)\nand (17), one may note that the extension to neutral kaons introduces an additional term \u223c n\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc p, which is absent in\nthe pure K \u2212 condensate case. This term opens a new URCA channel, let us call it k0URCA:\nk0URCA p\u0303 \u2194 \u00f1 + e + \u03bde \u2212\n\n(20)\n\nAlthough slightly exotic, this kind of \"proton decay\" is possible in dense matter, as one must remember that quasinucleons represent mixed states of normal nucleons and do not possesses a well-determined charge. Moreover, the\nkURCA transitions, i.e. transitions between the same type of quasi-nucleons (4), are now also present in the cos\u03b8C dependent part of the weak current. This means that for the dense matter state, where the two kinds of condensates\nare simultaneously present (\u03c6 6= 0, \u03b8 6= 0) , both the kURCA and dURCA cycles will take place at the same rate.\nThis is an important result as it is easier to fulfill the triangle condition for the Fermi momenta of nucleons in the\ncase of the kURCA channel.\nThe energy per unit volume and time released in one cycle due to the neutrino emission is equal to the product of\nthe neutrino energy and the doubled beta decay rate for a given quasi-particle i = p\u0303 or \u00f1\nZ\n2\nIURCA =\nd3 pi d3 pf d3 pe d3 p\u03bd fi (1 \u2212 ff )(1 \u2212 fe )Wif \u03b5\u03bd .\n(21)\n(2\u03c0)12\nThe decay rate Wij for a transition: i \u2192 j + e + \u03bde is given by the expression\nWif = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(\u03b5f \u2212 \u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5e \u2212 \u03b5\u03bd )\u03b4(ppf \u2212 p i \u2212 p e \u2212 p \u03bd )|hf e \u03bde | Hweak | i i|2\n\n(22)\n\n\f5\nThe squared matrix element may be factorised in a standard manner\n|hf e \u03bde | Hweak | i i|2 = H \u03bc\u03bd L\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the leptonic tensor is\nL\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n(p\u03bc p\u03bd + p\u03bde p\u03bc\u03bd\u0304 \u2212 pe *p\u03bd\u0304 g \u03bc\u03bd + i\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 pe\u03c1 p\u03bd\u0304\u03c3 )\n\u03b5e \u03b5\u03bd e \u03bd\u0304\n\nand the hadronic tensor includes the hadronic weak current J \u03bc with summation over the nucleon spin states\nX\nH \u03bc\u03bd =\nhpf , s\u2032 | J \u03bc |pi , sihpi , s| J +\u03bd |pf , s\u2032 i.\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\ns,s\u2032\n\nFor non-relativistic nucleons, the hadronic tensor becomes momentum-independent H \u03bc\u03bd = 2(|v|2 \u03b40\u03bc \u03b40\u03bd + |a|2 \u03b4i\u03bc \u03b4i\u03bd ),\nwhere a, v are the axial and vector parts of the hadronic current (17). The neutrino momentum |pp\u03bd | is of the order\nof thermal energy T , which means it is much smaller than the momenta of nucleons and that of electron, and may\nbe neglected in the delta function in (22). Finally, the matrix element (23) may be treated as a constant, being\nindependent of particle momenta. The phase space in (21) is weighted only by the three Fermi-Dirac distribution\nfunctions fi for p\u0303, \u00f1, e, because the neutrino leaves the matter freely. In order to calculate the emissivity integral,\none may use the so-called phase-space decomposition, a very useful technique to obtain the reaction rate for stronglydegenerated systems [22, 23]. After this calculation, neutrino emissivity may be finally written down as the following\nexpression:\nIURCA =\n\n457 \u03c0 6 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nT mp mn me |Mij |2 \u0398if e\n20 160\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u0398if e is a step function corresponding to the triangle condition: it is equal to 1 if vectors: p f , p i , p e form a\nclosed triangle, and 0 otherwise. Mij is the momentum-independent matrix element (23) corresponding to different\ntypes of reactions, and m\u2217i are effective masses of nucleons and electron. In the case of the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 condensation,\nthere are four channels for different URCA cycles: one in (3) two in (4) and one in (20). The last one is typical for\nthe presence of neutral kaons, whereas the reactions (4) are connected with the charged kaon condensate. Of course,\nthe first one, i.e. the dURCA cycle, is possible in normal npe matter as well as in matter with kaons. All of them\nbelong to the class of direct URCA processes, where three degenerated fermions only take part in the cycle, which\ncan be seen in the temperature dependence \u223c T 6 . So, the four different channels are only distinguished by the means\nof their matrix elements |Mij |2 , which now depend on the amplitudes of the two condensates \u03b8 and \u03c6:\ndURCA\n\nkURCA\n\nkURCA\n\n2\n|Mnp |2 = 2 G2F (1 + 3 gA\n)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c62 + \u03b82 cos\n\n\u03c7 \u00112\n2 \u00d7\n\n\u03c78\nh\u0010\ni\n\u00112\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u03b82 + \u03c62 cos\ncos2 \u03b8C + \u03c62 \u03c72 sin2 sin2 \u03b8C\n2\n2\n4 \u03c7 nh\n2 2\n\u03b8\n\u03c6\nsin\n\u03c7 i2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n\u03b8\n+\n\u03c7\n+\n(\u03c6\n+\n\u03c7\n)\ncos\n|Mnn |2 = 8 G2F cos2 \u03b8C\n\u03c78\n2\n\u0010\nh\n\u03c7 \u0011 i2 o\n2\n2\n2\n2 \u03c7\n\u2212 gA \u03b8 + \u03c6 cos\n+ 3 2 \u2206g \u03c7 cos\n4\n2\n2 \u03c7 nh\n2\n\u03b8\nsin\n\u03c7 i2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ 2 G2F sin2 \u03b8C\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n(\u03c6\n+\n\u03c7\n)\ncos\n\u03c76\n2\ni2 o\nh\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n+ 3 \u2206g \u03c72 cos \u2212 2gA \u03c62 sin2\n2\n4\n4 \u03c7 nh\n2 2\n\u03b8 \u03c6 sin 4\n\u03c7 i2\n\u03c62 + \u03c72 + (\u03b82 + \u03c72 ) cos\n|Mpp |2 = G2F cos2 \u03b8C\n8\n\u03c7\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011 i2 o\nh\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n+ 3 2 \u2206g \u03c72 cos2 \u2212 gA \u03c62 + \u03b82 cos\n4\n2\n2 \u03c7 nh\n2\n\u03b8\nsin\n\u03c7 i2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ 2 G2F sin2 \u03b8C\n\u03c6\n+\n(\u03b8\n+\n\u03c7\n)\ncos\n\u03c76\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011 i2 o\nh\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n+ 3 \u2206g \u03c72 cos \u2212 gA \u03c62 + \u03b82 cos\n2\n2\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\n\f6\n\ndURCA\n\nkURCA\n\n1\n\n1\n\nMnp\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\n\nMnn\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\n\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\n2\u03c0 0\n\n2\u03c0 0\n\nkURCA\n\nk0URCA\n1\n\n1\n\nMpn\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n0\n\nMpp\n0\n0\n\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\n2\u03c0 0\n\n2\u03c0 0\n\nFIG. 1: Normalized matrix element for different URCA channels as a function of condensate amplitudes \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nk0URCA\n\n2\n\n|Mpn | =\n\n32 G2F\n\u0010\n\n(1 +\n\n2\n3 gA\n)\n\n\u03b84 \u03c62 sin6\n\u03c78\n\n\u03c7\n2\u00d7\n\n(30)\n\n\u0011\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\ncos2 \u03b8C + \u03c72 cos2 sin2 \u03b8C\n\u03c6 sin\n4\n4\n2\n\n2\n\nAs was already shown in [21], for the case of the K \u2212 condensate only (\u03c6 \u2192 0) these matrix elements takes a much\nsimpler form\n\u03b8\n2\n|Mnn |2 = 12 G2F (1 + 3 \u2206g 2 ) sin2 \u03b8C sin2 \u03b8\n2\n|Mnp |2 = 2 G2F (1 + 3 gA\n) cos2 \u03b8C cos2\n2\n\n|Mpp | =\n2\n\n2 G2F\n\n|Mpn | = 0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(1 + 3 F ) sin \u03b8C sin \u03b8\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n\nwhere, for the transition p\u0303 \u2192 \u00f1 + e + \u03bd\u0304 which is not possible in the pure K \u2212 condensate, the corresponding matrix\nelement vanishes. By comparing expressions (28,29) and (32,33), one may see how the inclusion of K\u0304 0 introduces the\nterms proportional to cos2 \u03b8C and, in this way, makes the kaon-induced URCA processes at the same level of intensity\nas the direct URCA cycle in normal matter. This was already noted in the discussion of the weak hadronic current (17).\nThe matrix elements Mif are also highly \u03b8- and \u03c6-dependent. This dependence is shown in Fig.1, where the values of\nmax\n2\nmatrix elements were normalized to the maximal value for the dURCA cycle, which is Mnp\n= 2G2F (1 + 3gA\n). The\n\n\f7\nbehavior of \u03b8 and \u03c6 with matter density depends on the model of strong interactions used for dense matter description\n[4, 24]. Both the unknown strength of the kaon-nucleon coupling and the details of interactions in the non-strange\nsector affect the condensate behavior. However, roughly speaking, these papers showed that the typical value of the\nK \u2212 condensate amplitude \u03b8 is around 1, and in some cases it may be somewhat greater than \u03c0/2. Therefore, one\nmay suspect that the amplitude of the K\u0304 0 condensate takes similar values. A careful look at the plots in Fig.1 shows\nthat different cycles reach their maxima in different regions of the \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c6 plane, so one may conclude that almost\nindependently of the concrete values of the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 amplitudes, there always exists one cycle with emissivity\n2\napproximately equal to the maximal value of Mif , i.e. 2G2F (1 + 3gA\n). The given cycle works in neutron star matter\nwhen the corresponding triangle condition is satisfied:\ndURCA and k0URCA\nkURCA for \u00f1\nkURCA for p\u0303\n\n|kp \u2212 kn | < ke < kp + kn\n2kn > ke\n2kp > ke\n\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n\nThe above inequalities show that independently of the proton and lepton abundances at least one of the URCA\nchannel is opened. Thus, the final conclusion is that the simultaneous presence of the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 condensate leads\nto matter cooled very fast with intensity of the order of the fastest direct URCA cycle.\nConclusions\n\nThe extension of the charged kaon to the neutral kaon condensate leads to such mixing between the components of\ncurrents from the SU (3) octet that two new features emerge. First, the K\u0304 0 condensate opens an additional channel for\nthe URCA process (quasi-proton decay). Second, the K\u0304 0 presence results in emissivity for the kaon-induced URCA\nprocesses scaling no longer with sin2 \u03b8C but obtaining a contribution that scales as cos2 \u03b8C . This puts the kaon-induced\nURCA at the same level of importance as the normal direct URCA cycle. Moreover, the triangle condition says that\ndifferent cycles are opened in different matter compositions, covering the whole range froqqm pure neutron to pure\nproton matter, (0 < x < 1). Therefore, finally one may conclude that matter with the K \u2212 and K\u0304 0 condensate is\ncooled at the level of the most effective (direct) URCA cycle - regardless of its detailed composition.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by the Polish State Committee for Scientific Research Grant 2P03D 02025.\nAppendix\n\nBelow, there are matrices \u0393ij and \u0393\u0303ij that appear in the expression for the hadronic current (17), for the cos \u03b8C dependent part:\n\u0393\u03bcpn = \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 gA \u03b35 )\n\u0002\n\u03c7\n\u0393\u03bcpp = \u03b3 \u03bc \u2212(\u03c62 +\u03c72 ) \u2212 (\u03b82 +\u03c72 ) cos\n2\n\u03c7\n\u03c7 \u0001\u0003\n2\n2\n+ \u03b35 gA (\u03c6 +\u03b8 cos ) \u2212 2 \u2206g \u03c72 cos2\n2\n4\n\u0393\u03bcpp = \u0393\u03bcnn (\u03c6 \u2194 \u03b8)\n\n\u0393\u03bcnp = \u03b3 \u03bc (1 + gA \u03b35 )\nand for the sin \u03b8C -dependent part:\n\n\u0393\u0303\u03bcpn = \u2212\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 gA \u03b35 )\n\u0002\n\u03c7\n\u03c7\n\u03c7 \u0001\u0003\n\u0393\u0303\u03bcpp = \u03b3 \u03bc \u22122\u03c62 cos2 + \u03b35 gA (\u03c62 +\u03b82 cos ) \u2212 \u2206g \u03c72 cos\n4\n2\n2\n\u0002 2\n\u03c7\u0003\n\u03c7\n2 \u03c7\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n+ \u2206g \u03c7 cos\n\u0393\u0303nn = \u03b3 \u2212\u03c6 + (\u03c6 +\u03c7 ) cos + \u03b35 (2gA \u03c6 sin\n2\n4\n2\n\u0393\u0303\u03bcnp = \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 gA \u03b35 ) .\n\n\f8\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n\nS.
