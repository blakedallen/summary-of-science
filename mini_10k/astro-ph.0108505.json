Observational\ndata as diverse as precision measurements of the cosmic\nbackground radiation (e.g., de Bernardis et al. 2001; Halverson et al. 2001), measurements of absorption lines in the\nspectra of distant quasars (e.g., Efstathiou, Schaye & Theuns 2000), measurements of the abundances of deuterium,\nand other light elements (e.g., Burles, Nollett & Turner\n2001), surveys of the positions in redshift space of hundreds\nof thousands of galaxies (e.g., Peacock et al. 2001) and measurements of the brightnesses of distant supernovae (e.g.,\nReiss et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999) all point to a single\ncosmological model. In this model, the mean energy density\ntakes the critical value that makes space flat. Baryonic matter accounts for only a few percent of this energy density,\n\u223c 70% of which takes the form of material for which gravity\nacts repulsively. The remaining energy density (\u223c 30%) is\ncarried by collisionless massive particles of some type.\nThe way in which gravity amplifies seed inhomogeneities in collisionless dark matter (DM) to build up collapsed structures, around which galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies assemble, has been extensively studied over two\ndecades. On large scales the predictions of these studies\nyield the consistent interpretation of data alluded to above.\nHence, apparent conflicts with the data that have recently\nc 0000 RAS\n\nemerged on sub-galactic scales have attracted a great deal\nof interest (e.g., Spergel & Steinhardt 2000; Sellwood &\nKosowsky 2000; Evans 2001). Many of these conflicts arise\nbecause CDM predicts that DM halos have cuspy centres.\nOnly large and costly simulations of DM clustering are\ncapable of probing the structure of galactic halos on scales of\na few kiloparsecs, with the result that some controversy has\nsurrounded the proposal of Moore et al. (1998) that at the\nsmallest radii the density in a CDM halo becomes a powerlaw in radius, \u03c1 \u223c r \u2212\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u223c 1.4. Most protagonists\nnow agree that agreement with the simulation data can be\nachieved by fitting the two-power-law model with\n\u03c1(r) \u223c\n\n1\n.\nr \u03b1 (rs + r)3\u2212\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nHowever, this functional form provides only an approximate\ndescription of the data, in which the local logarithmic slope\nof the density profile decreases continuously from \u223c 3 at\nlarge radii to zero at the smallest radii. Even in the largest\nsimulations there are only a few million particles in any given\nhalo, so artificial discreteness effects become important at\nsome radius. At the smallest radius for which discreteness\neffects are unimportant, the slope is steeper than unity and\nmay be as large as 1.4.\nNavarro, Frenk & White (1997) observed that the CDM\nhalos that formed in many different cosmological models\ncould be well represented by the double-power-law model\n\n\f2\n\nBinney J.J. & Evans N.W.\n\n(1) with \u03b1 = 1, and this is now known as the NFW profile.\nIf every halo conforms to the NFW profile, the halo can be\ncharacterized by just two numbers: its peak circular speed\nvmax (which occurs at r = 2.2rs ) and the ratio c \u2261 r200 /rs\nof the scale radius to the radius within which the mean density exceeds the cosmic density by a factor of 200. In any\ngiven simulation, vmax and c are correlated in the sense that\nhalos with the largest concentrations c have the smallest rotation velocities. The quantitative details of the correlation\ndiffer from one cosmological model to another. Although the\nnumerical evidence is weaker because only CDM clustering\nhas been simulated at the highest resolution, there are clear\nindications that cuspy halos are a generic feature of DM\nclustering (Moore 1999; Knebe et al. 2001).\nSince we live in a galaxy that is prototypical of the\ngalaxies that together make the largest contribution to the\ncosmic luminosity density, it is natural to ask whether the\npredictions of CDM simulations agree with the data for the\nMilky Way. Navarro & Steinmetz (2000) and Eke, Navarro\n& Steinmetz (2001) have addressed this question by asking\nwhat values of vmax and r200 one should associate with the\nMilky Way, and then inferring from them the appropriate\nvalue of c. Once these three parameters have been chosen,\nthe profile that the dark matter had prior to the infall of\nthe Galactic baryons is determined. The dark-matter mass\npredicted by this profile interior to the solar radius R0 should\nnot be larger than the current dark-matter mass inside R0 .\nWhether this condition is in fact satisfied, is controversial.\nHere we argue that the predictions of CDM simulations\nare more directly and effectively tested by using measurements of solar-neighbourhood dynamics to normalize the\ndensity of dark matter at the Sun. With this normalization, the predicted density of dark matter a few kiloparsecs\nfrom the Galactic Centre conflicts strongly with astrophysical constraints for \u03b1 >\n\u223c 1. Unless the logarithmic slope of the\ndark-matter density profile somehow decreased as baryons\nfell into the Galactic dark halo, this constraint on \u03b1 strongly\nconflicts with all current DM simulations.\n\n2\n\nTHE LOCAL DM DENSITY\n\nBy measuring the line-of-sight velocities and distances of K\ndwarf stars seen towards the south Galactic pole, Kuijken &\nGilmore (1991) showed that at the solar radius R0 there is\n\u223c 71 \u00b1 6 M\u2299 pc\u22122 of material within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic\nplane. This result has been confirmed in several independent reworkings of the original data (e.g., Olling & Merrifield\n2001). Measurements of the proper motions and parallaxes\nof stars that lie within 200 pc of the Sun have yielded estimates of the local density of all matter: (76 \u00b1 15) mM\u2299 pc\u22123\n(Cr\u00e9z\u00e9 et al. 1998); (111 \u00b1 10) mM\u2299 pc\u22123 (Pham 1997);\n(102 \u00b1 6) mM\u2299 pc\u22123 (Holmberg & Flynn 2000). Since a uniform sheet 2.2 kpc thick and with a density of 100 mM\u2299 pc\u22123\nwould have a column density three times larger than the\n71 M\u2299 pc\u22122 measured by Kuijken & Gilmore, it is clear that\nthe Galactic mass density is strongly flattened close to the\nplane, presumably because the Galactic disc makes a large\ncontribution.\nBy counting disk M dwarfs in Hubble Space Telescope\nfields, Zheng et al. (2001) found that the vertical profile of\nthese objects is well modelled by\n\n\u03bd(z) = 0.435 sech2 (z/270 pc) + 0.565 exp(\u2212|z|/440 pc).\n\n(2)\n\nSince the majority of the disc's stellar mass must be contained in such faint red stars and other objects such as white\ndwarfs that trace the integrated star-formation history of\nthe disc, we may safely assume that the overall stellar mass\ndensity shares this profile. From equation (2), we have that\n1\n\u1e91 \u2261\n\u03bd(0)\n\nZ\n\n1.1 kpc\n\ndz \u03bd(z) = 691 pc.\n\n(3)\n\n\u22121.1 kpc\n\nBy counting stars within 5 pc of the Sun (which can be\ndetected through their large proper motions) and using\nHipparcos parallaxes Jahreiss & Wielen (1997) find that\nstars contribute 39 mM\u2299 pc\u22123 to the mass density at the\nplane. Multiplying this density by the effective disc thickness \u1e91, we have that stars contribute 26.9 M\u2299 pc\u22122 to the\n71 \u00b1 6 M\u2299 pc\u22122 of matter that lies within 1.1 kpc of the\nplane. The contribution of the interstellar medium to this\nfigure is uncertain, both because the densest gas is patchy,\nand because direct detection of H2 is difficult. Olling & Merrifield (2001) conclude that when helium is included, gas\ncontributes 13.7 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\u22c6 Thus, \u223c 41 M\u2299 pc\u22122 of the mass\nwithin 1.1 kpc of the plane can be accounted for by baryons,\nand the remaining \u223c 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 should be contributed by\nparticle DM. The error on this last number is large and\nuncertain. In addition to the errors reported by Kuijken &\nGilmore (\u00b16 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ), there should be contributions from\nthe work of Zheng et al. (2001), Jahreiss & Wielen and the\nsources cited by Olling & Merrifield. The overall error could\neasily be as large as 15 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\n\n3\n\nMICROLENSING CONSTRAINTS\n\nA crucial difference between baryonic and particle matter is\nthat the former can cause microlensing events, while the latter cannot. All published estimates of the optical depth to\nmicrolensing of sources near the Galactic Centre are nearly\nan order of magnitude greater than the value 4 \u00d7 10\u22127\nthat was originally anticipated (Paczy\u0144ski 1991, Griest et\nal. 1991), so it is of interest to ask what is the minimum\nbaryonic mass in the inner Galaxy that can yield the measured values. This question is readily answered if one accepts\n(i) that the density can never increase as one moves vertically away from the Galactic plane, and (ii) that the Galaxy\nis axisymmetric. Then the greatest optical depth per unit\nmass for microlensing a source that lies distance z0 from\nthe centre along the symmetry axis is obtained by forming\nthe mass into a uniform cylinder of any radius R that just\nbarely reaches up from the plane to clip our line of sight to\nthe star;\u2020 the height h of the optimal cylinder is therefore\nh(R) = z0 (1 \u2212 R/R0 ).\n\n(4)\n\n\u22c6 It is reassuring that the surface density from the ISM, averaged\nover a layer \u223c 300 pc thick, yields a density \u223c 46 mM\u2299 pc\u22123 that\nagrees with the difference between the dynamically determined\nvolume density (76 to 110 mM\u2299 pc\u22123 ) and the 39 mM\u2299 pc\u22123 contributed by stars.\n\u2020 We assume that the Sun lies in the plane; in reality it lies\n\u223c 14 pc above the plane (Binney, Gerhard & Spergel 1997).\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCuspy dark-matter halos and the Galaxy\n250\n\n250\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n3\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n\n2\n\nR (in kpc)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n6\n\n8\n\nR (in kpc)\n\n250\n\n250\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nR (in kpc)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\nR (in kpc)\n\nFigure 1. The panels show the circular-speed curves generated by the gas disc together with enough stars to yield \u03c4 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 (dotted\ncurves) and by cuspy haloes (long-dashed curves). The combined rotation curve is shown as a solid line and must lie below the fit to the\ntangent-velocity data (short-dashed line). The models differ in the cusp index of the halo \u03b1 and the local DM contribution.\n\nThe mass M and optical depth \u03c4 of this optimal cylinder\nare related by\n\nM (q)\n1\n= sin2 \u03c6 + q cos2 \u03c6 = 0.64,\nM (1)\nq\n\nc2 z0\n\u03c4,\n(5)\nG\nindependent of R (Kuijken 1997). In reality, the density of\nno component can be constant for z < h and then abruptly\ndrop to zero. It inevitably tapers smoothly to zero. If the\nvertical density profile is either an exponential in z, with\nthe scale height h chosen to maximize \u03c4 /M , or a Gaussian\nin z with the dispersion h chosen to maximize \u03c4 /M , then\nh is given by equation (4) and M has to be larger than\nthe value given by equation (5) by a factor of either e or\n(\u03c0e/2)1/2 = 2.07, respectively. For simplicity, we plot results\nbased on exponential profiles (which fit brightness profiles\nmuch better than do Gaussians). Hence, we assume\n\nThe angle between the Galactic bar and the Sun\u2013centre line\nis believed to lie near 20 deg (Binney et al. 1991, 1997; Englmaier & Gerhard 1999), and we adopt this value in the\nfollowing.\nFollowing Binney et al. (2000), we ask what circularspeed curve is implied if we structure the baryonic Galaxy\nso that (i) there is a given optical depth to microlensing for\na source that lies a distance z0 down the symmetry axis, (ii)\nthe vertical density profile is exponential in z with the scale\nheight given by equation (4) and (iii) the Galaxy inside R0 /2\nis elliptical with the axis ratio of equation (7). The circularspeed curve we derive should everywhere lie below the observational curve. Our circular-speed curves differ from those\npresented by Binney et al. in that here we include the contribution from the interstellar medium, the radial profile of\nwhich we take to follow equation (1) of Dehnen & Binney\n(1998),\u2021 with the surface density scaled to 13.7 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at\nR0 .\nThe latest measurements of the optical depth to bulge\nsources both come from the MACHO collaboration. From a\nDifference Imaging Analysis (DIA) of the data, Alcock et al.\n(2000) estimate from 99 events\n\nM=\n\nec2 z0\n\u03c4.\n(6)\nG\nOurs is a barred galaxy, and the optical depth of a given\ncylinder can be increased by distorting it into a suitably\naligned ellipse. Let \u03c6 be the angle between the major axis of\nthe ellipse and the Sun \u2013 centre line. Then Binney, Bissantz\n& Gerhard (2000) showed that \u03c4 /M is maximized if the\nellipse has axis ratio\nM=\n\nq = b/a = tan \u03c6\n\n(7)\n\nand that for this optimal axis ratio the mass required to\nachieve a given optical depth is smaller than the value given\nby equation (6) by a factor\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(\u03c6 = 20 deg). (8)\n\n\u2021 The first term in the exponential in this equation should be\nRm /R.\n\n\f4\n\nBinney J.J. & Evans N.W.\n\n\u03c4 = (3.2 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10\u22126 at (l, b) = (2.68 deg, \u22123.35 deg). (9)\nFrom an analysis of 52 events in which a clump giant was\nlensed, Popowski et al. (2000) find\n\u03c4 = (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 at (l, b) = (3.9 deg, \u22123.8 deg).\n\n(10)\n\nThe first estimate is based on events in which faint stars\nare lensed, so blending may render the optical depths uncertain. Therefore, we focus on the second estimate, which\nis based on the lensing of relatively bright stars. Moreover,\nthe luminosity distribution of these stars provides strong\nevidence that they really do lie close to the Galactic Centre rather than far behind it, where they would have larger\noptical depths. We may safely disregard the fact that the\noptical depth has not been measured at l = 0 since the\nvalue at l = 0 is bound to be greater than any value at\n|l| > 0. Binney et al. show that the non-zero width of the\ndistribution of the distances of the lensed stars increases the\nmeasured mean optical depth by <\n\u223c 5% and may safely be ignored. Hence, the formulae (6) and (8) may be applied with\nz0 = R0 tan(3.8 deg) = 531 pc. This gives \u223c 3.9 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299\nas a lower limit for the baryonic mass within the solar circle.\nWe remark that (10) is the lowest estimate of the microlensing optical depth towards the Galactic Centre published to\ndate, so our analysis errs on the conservative side.\nThe short-dashed curve in the panels of Fig. 1 shows\nthe relation vc = (R/R0 )0.1 220 kms\u22121 , which for R0 = 8 kpc\nprovides a reasonable fit to the tangent-velocity data after\ncorrection for non-circular velocities induced by the Galactic\nbar (Binney et al. 1991). The dotted curve in the panels of\nFig. 1 shows the circular-speed curve we obtain for \u03c4 given\nby equation (10) when the radial distribution of mass is determined by assuming that in addition to the gas disc, there\nis an exponential stellar disc with scale length 3 kpc and local\nsurface density 26.9 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , and an elliptical, exponential\ndisc with scale-length Rb = 1 kpc that contains the balance of the material that is required to make up the optical\ndepth. The main exponential disk is elliptical at R < R0 /2.\nThese parameter choices are designed to place as much mass\nas possible in the elliptical inner galaxy, where it generates\nthe most optical depth per unit contribution to the circularspeed curve. Binney et al. (2000) discuss alternative radial\ndistributions of stellar matter, and argue that for the given\noptical depth a lower circular-speed curve can only be obtained by placing more mass in the disc at R0 than has been\nmeasured to be present.\nThe solid curves in the panels of Fig. 1 show the circular\nspeeds obtained by adding in contributions from a dark matter halo of general form (1). The long-dashed curves show\nthe circular-speed curve of the halo in isolation. In the upper panels, the halo contributes 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 within 1.1 kpc\nof the plane; in the lower panels, it contributes 15 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ,\nthe minimum value suggested by the analysis of Section 2. In\nthe leftmost panels, the halo is an NFW model (\u03b1 = 1) with\nconcentration zero (i.e., \u03c1 \u223c r \u22121 at all radii). Although the\nfull curve does not go much above the observational limit\nshown by the dashed curve, it cannot be treated as consistent with the data because the scale-height distribution of\nthe stellar disc has been so ruthlessly manipulated to maximize the optical depth to a source 531 pc along the symmetry axis. In the rightmost panels, the index \u03b1 is chosen to be\nas large as possible, consistent with the total circular speed\n\nfalling below the tangent-velocity data. If the local halo surface density is 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 within 1.1 kpc, then \u03b1 \u223c 0.3 is\nneeded before the solid line drops to below the observational\nlimit; the corresponding value if the halo surface density is\n15 M\u2299 pc\u22122 is \u03b1 \u223c 0.8.\nIn all the panels of Figure 1, the full curve lies below the\nshort-dashed curve at R \u223c 500 pc. This discrepancy arises\nbecause a large scale height has been adopted for the stellar distribution at these radii, in order to bring stars into\nthe line of sight from the Sun to the sources (eq. 4). Infrared photometry implies that the stellar distribution does\nnot have such a large scale height, and the line-of-sight velocities of gas in the 'x2 disc' at R <\n\u223c 200 pc imply that the\ncircular speed there agrees with the dashed rather than the\nfull curve (e.g. Binney 1999). The obvious way to increase vc\nat R <\n\u223c 1 kpc without pushing it up at R \u223c 3 kpc is to move\nmass down into the plane at R <\n\u223c 1 kpc, thus diminishing the\noptical depth to the sources. In other words, there is clear\ndynamical evidence that the stellar distribution is not optimal from the point of view of generating optical depth per\nunit mass, and only a still more massive stellar distribution\nthan we have assumed will generate \u03c4 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 . Consequently, the circular-speed curves in Fig. 1 should be moved\nup at R \u223c R0 /2 to reflect the less than perfect efficiency\nwith which the stars generate optical depth, and there will\nbe correspondingly less room for the halo to contribute to\nthe circular speed.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nHow can this head-on collision between the enormously successful DM theory and microlensing measurements be resolved? First it is worth reassuring oneself that the microlensing data we have used are compatible with some\ngalaxy model, for the older results were not (Binney et\nal. 2000). Near-infrared light should be a good tracer of stellar mass (Rix & Rieke 1993), so it is instructive to construct\nGalaxy models in which mass follows the light distribution\nthat is inferred from near-IR photometry (Binney et al. 1997;\nFreudenreich 1998; H\u00e4fner et al. 2000; Bissantz & Gerhard\n2002). The main problem here is the effect of extinction by\ndust, which even in the K-band is non-negligible. The best\navailable models contain a bar about 3 kpc long with an\naxis ratio about 3 : 1 whose major axis is inclined at about\n20 deg to the Sun\u2013centre line. When all the dynamically permitted mass is put into such a model, it generates an optical\ndepth \u03c4 \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 to a point 500 pc along the minor axis\n(Bissantz & Gerhard, 2002). Thus, a plausible model of the\nGalaxy has an optical depth that lies within \u223c 1.5\u03c3 of the\nmeasured value (10) if the DM content of the inner Galaxy\nis entirely negligible. Prior to the advent of high-resolution\nsimulations, this result would have been taken as confirmation that DM halos have homogeneous cores, as was long\nassumed to be the case for no compelling reason. Now we\nmust ask if there are any corroborating pieces of evidence\nthat DM makes a negligible contribution to the mass of the\ninner Galaxy. There are two, namely the pattern speed of the\nGalactic bar and hydrodynamical modelling of longitudevelocity data.\nDM, being dissipationless, rotates much more slowly\nthan the Galaxy's baryons and will not participate fully in\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fCuspy dark-matter halos and the Galaxy\nthe Galactic bar. The response of the DM to the bar is out\nof phase with it, and this provides a drag force or dynamical friction. When the DM and baryons provide comparable\nmass, the dynamical friction is at its most severe. This is\nexactly the r\u00e9gime in which CDM finds itself. Both analytic\nand numerical arguments agree that if there is substantial\nDM present in the bar region, dynamical friction slows the\nrotation rate of a bar on the timescale of a few rotation periods (Weinberg 1985, Debattista & Sellwood 2000). So, a\npowerful argument that DM is negligible in the bar region\n(the inner 3kpc) comes from measurements of the pattern\nspeed \u03c9b of the Galactic bar. Dehnen (1999) shows that the\nvelocity-space distribution of stars near the Sun that can\nbe constructed from Hipparcos data yields a direct estimate\nof \u03c9b as a multiple of the circular speed at the Sun, \u03a90 :\nthe natural interpretation of the data requires the Sun to\nlie just outside the bar's outer Lindblad resonance, so that\n\u03c9b = (1.95\u00b10.15)\u03a90 . Confirmation of the high pattern speed\ncomes form the hydrodynamical simulations of Englmaier &\nGerhard (2000), who obtain a slightly higher value of \u03c9b by\nrequiring the 3 kpc expanding arm to lie just within corotation. We conclude that the Galactic bar is a fast bar, and\nits corotation radius is comparable with its size as inferred\nfrom COBE/DIRBE data (\u223c 3.5 kpc).\nStudies of the flow of gas at R <\n\u223c 4 kpc probe the Galactic potential by seeking matches between features in simulated longitude-velocity plots with those observed in the\nspectral lines of HI, CO and other molecules (e.g., Englmaier\n& Gerhard 1999). These features are associated with orbital\nresonances, so the longitudes at which they occur depend\non both \u03c9b and the underlying circular-speed curve. Since\nnon-circular motions are driven by the non-axisymmetric\ncomponent of the Galactic potential, the extent in velocity\nof features is a measure of how much the bar contributes to\nthe overall potential, and therefore constrains the contribution to the potential of DM. Englmaier & Gerhard (1999)\nfind little DM within the inner 3 kpc. The spiral arms outside\ncorotation are probably affected by the dark halo. However,\neven at the Solar circle, the halo contribution to the radial\nforce is only \u223c 20% in their models. Similarly, the stellar\ndynamical models (e.g., H\u00e4fner et al. 2000), in which there\nis no DM in the central regions, reproduce essentially all of\nthe kinematic data on the velocity dispersion and streaming\nof stars in the Galactic bulge.\nWe are therefore driven to the conclusion that the high\nmicrolensing optical depth is in excellent agreement with two\nother strong pieces of evidence on the distribution of baryons\nand DM in the inner Galaxy. By combining the microlensing\noptical depth with the DM contribution estimated from local\nkinematics, we have shown that even the least concentrated\nNFW model is clearly ruled out, as it violates the constraint\non the Galactic rotation curve. In fact, if the DM locally\ncontributes \u223c 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 within 1.1 kpc of the Galactic\nplane, then no halo with a cusp steeper than \u223c 1/r 0.3 is\nviable.\nPopowski et al.'s (2000) value of the optical depth \u03c4\nis preliminary, though entirely consistent with the earlier\nresults. We can estimate the maximum value of \u03c4 compatible\nwith an NFW halo in the following way. Let us use models\ncomposed of scaled copies of our inner Galaxy together with\nany of the NFW dark haloes occupying the shaded region of\nFigure 4 of Eke et al. (2001). These are \u039bCDM haloes which\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nsatisfy the constraint that the dark matter within the solar\ncircle is less than 4.3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 and are advocated by Eke\net al. as satisfactory representations of the Galactic halo.\nWe require that the combined circular-speed lie below the\nrelation vc = (R/R0 )0.1 220 kms\u22121 (the short-dashed curve\nin Figure 1). If the NFW halo has a local DM surface density\n\u223c 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , then the inner Galaxy must be scaled by\n\u223c 60%, whilst if the surface density is \u223c 15 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , then\nthe scale factor is \u223c 80%. So, pushing all parameters to\ntheir very extremes and assuming that the baryonic matter\nis optimally configured in the inner Galaxy, then an NFW\nhalo is compatible with an optical depth \u03c4 \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Vincent Eke for kindly providing us with data\nfrom his numerical simulations.
