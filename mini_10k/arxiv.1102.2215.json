In particular, it was found that the superconductivity in these materials coexists with a strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) order with an unprecedentedly\nlarge magnetic moment of 3.31 \u03bcB /Fe formed below a\nNeel temperature of 559K [4, 5], meanwhile the conducting electron concentration is extremely low[6]. Unlike the\ncollinear [7\u20139] or bi-collinear[10\u201312] AFM order observed\nin the parent compounds of other iron-based superconductors, the neutron observation found that these materials have a blocked checkerboard AFM order[5].\nThese compounds have the ThCr2 Si2 type crystal\nstructure, as shown in Fig. 1(a), isostructural with 122type iron pnictides [13]. From the latest X-rays, transmission electron microscopy, and neutron scattering measurements, it was suggested that the composition of the\nK-intercalated FeSe superconductors Ky Fe2\u2212x Se2 is close\nto Ky Fe1.6 Se2 with a fivefold expansion of the\n\u221a\n\u221a parent\nThCr2 Si2 unit cell in the ab plane, namely a 5 \u00d7 5\nFe-vacancies superstructure [5, 14], which corresponds\nto one-fifth Fe-vacancies. In an Fe-Fe square lattice,\nan Fe atom nearby a vacancy is 3-Fe-neighbored, or 2Fe-neighbored, or even 1-Fe-neighbored. Topologically\na square lattice composed only by 3-Fe-neighbored Fe\natoms exists only in one arranging order but with two\ndifferent kinds of chirality, right-handed or left-handed\nrotations[15], as shown\nin Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThis is exactly a 5 \u00d7 5 superstructure.\nThe peculiar properties observed in K-intercalated\niron-based chalcogenide superconductors indicate that\nthese materials represent a special limit where the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity\nplays an important role in the formation of supercon-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Ky Fex Se2 with the ThCr2 Si2 -type\nstructure: (a) a tetragonal unit cell containing two formula\nunits without any vacancy; (b) and (c) are schematic top view\nof an Fe-Fe square layer with one-fifth Fe-vacancies (x = 1.6)\nordered\n\u221a\n\u221a with the right- and left-chirality, respectively.

The filled circles denote the Fe atoms while the\nempty circles denote the Fe-vacancies. After optimizing the\nstructure by the energy minimization, the Fe atoms go into\na blocked distribution from a uniform square distribution, in\nwhich the four closest Fe atoms form a block, represented\nby dashed (blue) circles in (b) and (c), whose bond distance\nis shorter than that of the uniform Fe square lattice (green\ndots). Correspondingly, the angle \u03b8 decreases from 180\u25e6 to\n176\u25e6 \u2212 178\u25e6 .\n\nducting pairs. To reveal the hidden physics, we have\nperformed the first-principles electronic structure calculations for K0.8+x Fe1.6 Se2 with x = 0 and \u00b10.1. We find\nthat the ground state of K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is an AFM semiconductor with a blocked checkerboard long-range AFM\norder (Fig. 3(c)) and an energy gap of 594 meV, and\nK0.8\u00b10.1 Fe1.6 Se2 are doped electron- or hole-type AFM\nsemiconductors. K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is thus an essential parent compound so that the observed superconductivity in\nKy Fe2\u2212x Se2 is based on the doped AFM semiconductors.\nIn our calculations the plane wave basis method was\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Electronic structure of K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2\nwith one-fifth Fe-vacancies ordered in a way as shown by Fig.\n1(b) or (c) in the nonmagnetic state: (a) the band structure;\n(b-i) are the Fermi surface sheets due to the bands crossing\nthe Fermi energy denoted by (1-8) in (a), respectively. The\ncorresponding Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 4(b). The Fermi\nenergy sets to zero.\n\nused. We adopted the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof formula [16]\nfor the exchange-correlation potentials. The ultrasoft\npseudopotentials [17] were used to model the electron-ion\ninteractions. The kinetic energy cut-off and the charge\ndensity cut-off of the plane wave basis were chosen to be\n800 eV and 6400 eV, respectively. A mesh of 18 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 8\nk-points were sampled for the Brillouin-zone integration\nwhile the Gaussian broadening technique was used in the\ncase of metallic states. In the calculations, the lattice parameters with the internal atomic coordinates were optimized by the energy minimization. The optimized tetragonal lattice parameters in the magnetic states agree excellently with the experimental data[5].\n\u221a \u221a\nIn the calculations, we adopted a 5\u00d7 5\u00d71 tetragonal\nsupercell, in which there are two FeSe layers with total\n16 Fe atoms and 4 Fe-vacancies, 20 Se atoms, and 8 K\natoms and 2 K-vacancies, to represent K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 . For\nK atoms, there are two inequivalent positions in the supercell. Accordingly, there are a number of inequivalent\narrangements for the two K-vacancies. From the calculations, we find that both the electronic band structures\nand the Fe moments are hardly affected by these inequivalent arrangements. And the energy difference among\nthese different K arrangements is within 1 meV/Fe in\nboth spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized cases. This is\nconsistent with the experimental observation that the vacancies on K sites are in positional disorder [14].\nFigure 2 shows the non-magnetic band structure and\nFermi surface of K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 with one-fifth Fe-vacancies\nordered in a way as shown by Fig. 1(b) or (c). There are\n8 bands crossing the Fermi level. An important feature\n\nrevealed by the calculation is that due to a substantial\nlattice distortion driven by Fe vacancies, the bond distances among four closest Fe atoms around a Se atom\nare reduced. These four Fe atoms will form a compact\nsquare (we will call it a block below), as shown by the\nlight blue circles in Fig. 1(b). The angle \u03b8, which is\nshown in Fig. 1(b), decreases from 180\u25e6 to about 176\u25e6 .\nAs a result, the Fe-Fe and Fe-Se chemical bonds within\neach block become stronger. This gains an energy of\nabout 160 meV/Fe. Such a tetramer lattice distortion\nis not due to the spin-phonon interaction since it happens in both non-magnetic and magnetic states. It is\nin fact driven by the chemical bonding, namely this is a\nchemical-bonding-driven lattice distortion. On the contrary, all the structural or lattice distortions previously\nfound in the iron-pnictides and chalcogenides are driven\nby the spin-phonon interactions [8], namely magnetismdriven lattice distortions.\nFigure 3 shows eight possibly energetically favored\nmagnetic orders arranged in a right-chirality lattice (Fig.\n1(b)). From the calculations, if the energy of the nonmagnetic state is set to zero, we find that the respective energies of these eight states, i.e. the ferromagnetic,\ncheckerboard AFM, blocked checkerboard AFM, quaternary collinear AFM, collinear AFM, bi-collinear AFM,\ncell-in collinear AFM, and cell-in bi-collinear AFM states,\nare (-0.070, -0.189, -0.342, -0.232, -0.293, -0.229, -0.254,\n-0.267) eV/Fe for K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 . The corresponding magnetic moments are (3.29, 2.76, 3.37, 3.10, 3.32, 3.22, 3.20,\n3.26) \u03bcB /Fe. The ground state of K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is thus\nfound to have a blocked checkerboard AFM order (Fig.\n3(c)) with a large magnetic moment of 3.37\u03bcB /Fe, in\nagreement excellently with the latest neutron scattering\nmeasurement [5]. The similar magnetic order was also reported in a calculation to show metallic KFe1.6 Se2 [18].\nHere we emphasize that it is the chemical-bonding\ndriven tetramer lattice distortion mentioned above that\nmakes the blocked checkerboard AFM order be the lowest in energy. Without this tetramer lattice distortion,\nthe energy of the collinear AFM state (Fig. 3(e)) is in\nfact 43 meV/Fe lower than that of the blocked checkerboard AFM state. The collinear AFM order is the ground\nstate magnetic order of the iron-pnictides, driven by\nthe As-bridged AFM superexchange interaction between\ntwo next-nearest Fe atoms, which dominates over other\nexchange interactions. However, in K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 , the\nchemical-bonding driven tetramer lattice distortion reduces the bond distance within each block so that the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two nearest\nFe atoms inside a block and the AFM exchange interactions between neighboring two blocks are substantially\nenhanced. It turns out that the blocked checkerboard\nAFM order dominates over all the other magnetic orders.\nFigure 4(a) shows the electronic band structure of\nK0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 in the blocked checkerboard AFM ground\nstate. To our surprise, we find that the compound\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) (a) Electronic band structure of Fevacancies ordered K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 in the ground state with a\nblocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order (Fig. 3(c)).

Here the top of the valence band is set to zero.\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Schematic top view of eight possible\nmagnetic orders in the Fe-Fe square layer with one-fifth Fevacancies. Among these magnetic orders, the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order in (c) is the ground state, in\nwhich the magnetic moments within each block are in parallel, but the magnetic moments for the neighboring two blocks\nare in anti-parallel. The Fe spins are shown by arrows. The\nempty circles mark the Fe vacancies. The squares or rectangles enclosed by the dashed lines denote the magnetic unit\ncells.\n\nK0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is an AFM semiconductor with an energy\nband gap as large as \u223c 594 meV. This is different from\nthe parent compounds of other iron-based superconductors, they are either magnetic or non-magnetic semimetals. K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 with the checkerboard AFM, collinear\nAFM, or quaternary collinear AFM order is also found\nto be semiconducting. The corresponding energy band\ngaps are 22, 73, and 185 meV, respectively. With any\nother magnetic order, K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is in a metallic state.\nFigure 5(a) shows the total and orbital-resolved partial density of states (spin-up part) for K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 in\nthe blocked checkerboard AFM ground state. We find\nthat the states around the top valence bands are composed of both Fe-3d and Se-4p orbitals with the same\npeak energies. This is consistent with the localized fea-\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 in the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state: (a) total and orbitalresolved partial density of states (spin-up part); (b) projected\ndensity of states onto the five Fe-3d orbitals at an Fe atom.\nHere the top of the valence band sets to zero. And x-axis is\nalong the two next-nearest neighbor Fe-Fe.\n\ntures of these bands, enhanced by Fe-Fe and Fe-Se chemical bonding due to the tetramer lattice distortion. On\nthe contrary, the lower conduction bands are mainly contributed by the Fe-3d orbitals.\nBy projecting the density of states onto the five 3d orbitals of an Fe atom in the blocked checkerboard AFM\nground state (Fig. 5(b)), we find that the five up-spin\norbitals are almost fully filled. This suggests that the\ncrystal field splitting induced by Se atoms is small, similar to the case of iron-pnictides [8]. The large magnetic\nmoment formed around each Fe results from the Hund's\nrule coupling. The down spin orbitals are partially filled\nby dz2 , dxy , and dyz orbitals. Such anisotropy among the\nfive down spin orbitals in K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is enhanced by the\nordered Fe-vacancies.\nWe have verified the above results using the virtual\ncrystal approximation (VCA) for K atoms. We then replaced K0.8 by K0.7 and K0.9 respectively by using VCA\nto simulate the hole-doping and electron-doping effect\nupon the AFM semiconductor K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 . As shown\n\n\f4\nin Fig. 6, the electronic band structure of hole or electron doped K0.8\u00b10.1 Fe1.6 Se2 is almost the same as the\none for the un-doped case (Fig. 4). The magnetic moments of Fe ions are also hardly changed by doping.\nThe doped electrons and holes occupy the bottom conduction bands and the top valence bands, respectively.\nThe volumes enclosed by the Fermi surfaces are found\nto be 0.529 holes/cell and 0.642 electrons/cell, namely\n5.00 \u00d7 1020 holes/cm3 and 6.06 \u00d7 1020 electrons/cm3 , respectively. In principle, every excess K0.1 can supply 1\nelectron/cell to the material. Thus both electron and\nhole doping upon K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 are very efficient, similar to conventional semiconductors. But the total carrier\nconcentration is very low, in comparison with other ironbased superconductors. This agrees with the infrared\nmeasurement[6].\nWe have calculated the formation energy of\nK0.8+x Fe1.6\u2212x/2 Se2 , defined by (0.8 + x)EK + (1.6 \u2212\nx/2)EF e + 2ESe \u2212 Ex , where EK , EF e , and ESe are the\natomic energies of K, Fe, and Se, respectively, and Ex\nis the total energy of K0.8+x Fe1.6\u2212x/2 Se2 . For x = 0,\n0.2 and \u22120.4, corresponding to K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 , KFe1.5 Se2 ,\nand K0.4 Fe1.8 Se2 , we find that the formation energies\nare 16.652, 16.564, and 16.632 eV, respectively. Here\nthese stoichiometric compounds are in a balance of\nchemical valence, in which K, Fe and Se are in 1+, 2+,\nand 2- valence states, respectively. The ground states\nof Fe-vacancies ordered K0.4 Fe1.8 Se2 and KFe1.5 Se2 are\nin a collinear AFM order[9]. The formation energy\ndata indicate that K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is energetically more\nfavorable when K atoms are intercalated into FeSe. Thus\nK0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is more likely to be the parent compound\nof potassium intercalated FeSe\u221a superconductors\nupon\n\u221a\ndoping. The superstructure 5 \u00d7 5 with Fe1.6 Se2\nlayers may thus be the framework or backbone of\nsuperconductors Ky Fe2\u2212x Se2 .\nWe have also calculated the electronic structures of\nA0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 (A=Rb, Cs, or Tl) and found that they are\nall AFM semiconductors. The energy band gaps of these\ncompounds are 571, 548, and 440 meV, respectively.\nIn conclusion, we have performed the first principles\ncalculations for the electronic structure and magnetic\norder of Ky Fe2\u2212x Se2 . We find that the ground state\nof K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 is a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductor with an energy gap of 594 meV.\nThe ground state magnetic order is a blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order with a large magnetic moment of 3.37\u03bcB , in agreement with the experimental measurements. The underlying mechanism is the chemicalbonding-driven tetramer lattice distortion. Doping electrons or holes into K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 by intercalating more or\nless K to the compound almost do not change the band\nstructure as well as the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic order. Our result suggests that K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2\nserves as a parent compound which becomes superconducting upon electron or hole doping.\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Electronic band structures and\nFermi surfaces in the blocked checkerboard antiferromagnetic\nground state with the left chirality: (a-c) for K0.7 Fe1.6 Se2\nand (d-f) for K0.9 Fe1.6 Se2 , to represent the hole-doping or\nelectron-doping upon K0.8 Fe1.6 Se2 , respectively. The Fermi\nenergy sets to zero.\n\nWe would like to thank W. Bao for helpful discussion\nand P.C. Dai for drawing our attention for the magnetic\nordered state as shown in Fig. 3(d).
