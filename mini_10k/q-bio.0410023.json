It has been known that all\ntRNAs share a common primary, secondary, tertiary structure. Most tRNA sequences have\na \"CCA\" hat in terminus 5' and a polyA tail in terminus 3' in its primary structure. Its\nsecondary structure is represented by a cloverleaf. They have four base-paired stems and a\nvariable stem, defining three stem loops (the D loop, anticodon loop, and T loop) and the\nacceptor stem, to which oligonucleotides are added in the charging step[1]. Variable loop\nvaries in length from 4 to 13 nt, some of the longer variable loops contain base-paired stems.\nThe tRNAs also share a common three-dimensional shape, which resembles an inverted\n\"L\". Though much effort had been put on tRNA research in the past time, little is known\nabout specific features of tRNA that are exclusive to a species, taxa or phylogenetic domain\nlevel[2]. With the progress of genome projects, a vast amount of nucleotide sequence data\nof tRNA is now available, which makes it possible to study the tRNA genes expression for\na wide range of organisms.\nRecently scientists are trying to find specific feature in genes families by a new tool-\ncomplex networks. With the development of techniques on oligonucleotide or cDNA arrays,\nusing gene chips to erect a complicated network and studying its feature and evolution has\nbecome a hot subject, and has gained a success [3, 4, 5, 6]. Basically, the networks can\nbe classified into two types in terms of its degree distributions p(k) of nodes: exponential\nnetworks and scale-free networks. The former type has a prominent character that although\nnot all nodes in that kind of network would be connected to the same degree, most would have\na number of connections hovering around a small, average value, i.e. k \u223c hki, where k is the\nnumber of edges connected to a node and is called degree of the node. The distribution leads\nto a Poisson or exponential distribution, such as random graph model[7] and small-world\nmodel[8], which is also called homogenous networks. The latter type network has a feature\nthat some nodes act as \"very connected\" hubs which have very large numbers of connections,\nbut most of the nodes have small numbers of connections. Its degree distribution is a powerlaw distribution, p(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 . It is called inhomogeneous network, or scale-free network[9].\nThe tRNA sequences have similarities in sequences and structure, which make it possible\nto construct networks and use specialized clustering techniques to make classification. The\n2\n\n\fsimilarity of tRNA sequences suggests their relationships in evolutionary history. If we\nconsider all the tRNA sequences at present evolve from common ancestor via mutation,\nthe sequence similarity will reveal their evolutionary affiliation. There are lots of tRNA\nsequences. The similarities of every two of the sequences are different. Lots of data will\nbe dealt with. Since complex network is a good model to describe and study complex\nrelationships, the network model may be useful in this field. In this paper, we constructed a\nsimilarity network of 3917 tRNA genes in order to show network model is a powerful tool to\nstudy the evolutionary relationships among the tRNA genes. The topology of the network is\ndiscussed, the degree distribution and clustering coefficient are considered,and the network\nconstructed by the same number of random tRNA sequences is used to make comparisons.\n\nII.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA.\n\ntRNA sequences\n\nTransfer RNA sequence have been collected into database by Sprinzl et al[10]in 1974.\nAll of our data, 3719 tRNA genes sequences, are retrieved from this database (free available at http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/departaments/biochemie/sprinzl/trna/), which including 61 anticodon subsets, 429 species, and 3 kingdoms: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya.\nEach tRNA sequence has 99 bases when the variable stem is considered. For convenience\nof alignment, the absent bases in some positions of the tRNAs are inserted with \"blank\".\nFirstly. we align the tRNA sequences with the same anticodons, and then align all 3719\ntRNAs. Since there have been too many conclusions proving that tRNA genes have a high\nsimilarity in sequences[11, 12, 16], the results of the alignment of 3719 tRNA gene sequences\nwill not be listed in detail. We only focus on some prominent characters of the statistics of\nthe alignment.\n\nB.\n\ntRNA sequences network\n\nIf each base including the inserted \"blank\" is considered equally, the length of a tRNA\nis L = 99. To align two tRNA sequences, a parameter s is used to depict their similarity\ndegree, which indicates how many bases in the same position of two tRNA gene sequences\nare identical. For example, if the first bases of two tRNA sequences both are A, one score is\n3\n\n\fadded to s. Obviously, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 99. Although it is the simplest kind of alignment, as we show\nlater, it gives lots of information of the relationships among tRNA genes. When s = 99, it\nmeans two sequences are matched perfectly. Since the perfectly matched sequences have the\nthe same significance in biology, we take only one of them as a representative. To construct\nthe tRNA similarity network, every sequence is considered as a node. If the alignment score\ns of two tRNA sequences is larger than a given similarity degree s0 , put an edge between\nthe corresponding nodes. Obviously, if s0 is small, the nodes will connect closely, and when\ns0 grows larger, the number of connections will decrease.\nFor comparison, we make a similarity network of the same number of random tRNA\ngenes. To generate the random tRNA genes, every base of the sequences is randomly taken\nfrom the four bases (C, G, A and T) and the sequences must conform to the prototype of the\nreal tRNA, which means the sequences we generate randomly must confirm the secondary\nstructure of tRNA.\n\nIII.\n\nGRAPH TOOL\n\nPajek (the Slovene word for spider), a program for large-network analysis [13] (free available at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/), was used to map the topology of\nthe network.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\nThe topology of network\n\nFigure 1 displays several typical topologies of the similarity network of different kinds\nof tRNA gene sequences. Figure 1 (a), (b) and (c) are similarity networks constructed by\ntRNA genes with the same anticodons (CGC, CCA and TGC respectively) and S0 = 60.\nThe networks of tRNA genes with the same anticodon identity are highly clustered. Some\nof them divide into two or more clusters, such as figure 1(c). Each of the clusters almost\nentirely connected when s0 is small. When s0 grows large, the connection number decreases,\nand the network becomes not so closely connected. Figure1(d) is the similarity network of\nanticodon GTT when s0 = 80. As more nodes added in the network, the network becomes\nmore complex. Figure 1 (e), (f) shows the network with a large N (the number of nodes).\n4\n\n\f(e) is the network containing anticodons CAT and GCC with S0 = 80, and (f) is the network\nof all 3420 tRNA sequences with S0 = 90. Small local clusters with the same anticodons get\ntogether to form a large cluster, \"very connected\" hubs can be observed in the center of the\nnetwork (figure 1 (f)). At a large similarity degree, the scale free property (or power law\ndistribution) emerges, which means a few nodes have a large degree (number of connections),\nbut most nodes have a small degree. To make the figure 1 (e) more visualized, we extracted\nthe nodes whose connections number is bigger than 25 to make the figure 2. It also has hubs\nin the center of the network. Of course, the hubs are smaller. The scale free property is still\nkept.\nThe distribution of the connected probability of the networks of the tRNA genes with the\nsame anticodon is shown in table I. The connected probability is defined as the fraction of\nnumber of real connections to the largest number of possible connections. In the table it can\nbe found, when s0 = 50, the network is almost entirely connected and most of the connected\nprobabilities are larger than 0.8; when s0 = 90, most of the connected probabilities decrease\nto one tenth of the former, and some decrease to zero.\nConsider the network of random tRNA sequences in the same size. When similarity\ndegree s0 is small, most of the nodes have the same number of connections. When s0\nincreases, the number of the edges of the network decreases sharply and most of the nodes\nlose their links; only few of them have two or three edges linked. Table II shows the statistics\nof the connection numbers of real tRNA similarity network and random tRNA similarity\nnetwork at different similarity degrees. The table shows that when s0 = 50, the number\nof the connections of the two networks are very large; and when s0 = 90, both of them\ndrop, but the random one drops more quickly than real one does. The connection number of\nreal tRNA network nreal drops from 3434403 (S0 = 50) to 3429 (S0 = 90). The connection\nnumber of random tRNA network nrandom drop from 4321688 (S0 = 50) to 0 when S0 = 80.\nIt shows the real tRNA sequences have more similarity with each other than random ones\ndo. In other words, the real tRNA sequences are not randomly taken. If we consider that\nthe real tRNA genes have evolutionary relationships, the differences between the statistics\nof real and random tRNA similarity networks shown above can be explained to a certain\nextent.\n\n5\n\n\fB.\n\nDegree distributions\n\nIt has already been found that networks constructed of the large scale organization of\ngenomic sequence segments display a transition from a Gaussian distribution via a truncated\npower-law to a real power-law shaped connectivity distribution towards increasing segment\nsize.[14]. The similarity networks of tRNA sequences have similar features. The investigations begin with an important parameter, degree distribution p(k) of the nodes, and the\nanalysis is considered in figure 3.\nAs observed in Figure 3, with the similarity degree s0 increasing, p(k) behaves more and\nmore similar to power-law distribution. When s0 = 50, degree distribution p(k) of the nodes\nfollows a uninterrupted fluctuated distribution. For those k < 1088, Np(k) fluctuate from 1\nto 3; and for those k > 1800, Np(k) fluctuate from 1 to 9, and the peak of the fluctuation\nis at k = 2600. The mean degree hki = 2008, and the maximal degree kmax = 3052. When\ns0 = 60, the peak of the fluctuation deviates to left, at k = 100. When s0 = 70, the\ndistribution of p(k) appears a analogous power-law distribution if ignore the minimal value\nof k. For s0 > 70, the distribution transits from a analogous power-law distribution to a real\npower-law. As shown in figure 3(e), when s = 90, the distribution curve fits the power-law\nperfectly. The fitting result is p(k) = 0.192k \u22121.036 \u2212 0.006.\nComparing to the real tRNA gene sequences, the degree distribution of the network of\nrandom tRNA sequences, when s0 = 50, is a Gaussion distribution (figure 3(f)). Most nodes\nhave approximately the same degree, k \u2248 hki = 2527; the maximal degree kmax = 2895\nand the minimal degree kmin = 2327. When s0 = 60, the distribution is almost unchanged\n(figure 3(g)). When s0 = 70, the number of the edges descend sharply with its maximal\ndegree k = 5. In figure 3(f), (g), there are lower peaks except the main peaks of the\nGaussion distribution. It is possibly because the random tRNA sequences are not generated\ncompletely arbitrarily for they must conform to the prototype of the real tRNA.\nFrom above data analysis, we can conclude the real tRNA genes are more self-organized\nthan the random tRNA genes. The power-law distribution means there are a few tRNA\ngenes which behave as \"very connected\" hubs of the similarity network. Lots of tRNA\ngenes are similar with them in arranging of sequences. If we suppose all the tRNA genes\ncome from common ancestor, it is possible that the \"very connected\" tRNA genes will have\nmore relationships with the ancestor than other tRNA genes do. In other words, the \"very\n6\n\n\fconnected\" tRNA genes probably diverge less from ancestral sequences than other tRNA\ngenes do in the evolutionary history. In mathematics, a way to construct a scale free network\nis to follow a rule that an added node has much more possibility to connect with a node with\na large degree than to connect with a nod with a small degree[9]. In the tRNA similarity\nnetwork, it maybe means the tRNA genes which have small degrees diverged more from\nancestor sequences and is less stable than the tRNA genes which have large degrees.\n\nC.\n\nClustering coefficient\n\nIf a node connect with i other nodes and there are j edges connected within these i nodes,\nthe clustering coefficient of the original node is defined as\nc=\n\n2j\ni(i \u2212 1)\n\nwhere i (i \u2212 1) /2 is the total number of possible connections among i nodes. Clustering coefficient reflects relationships of the neighbors of a node, and quantifies the inherent tendency\nof the network to clustering. As shown in Figure 4, the average clustering coefficient creal of\nthe real tRNA network is larger than the random one. As s0 increase, creal decrease. When\ns0 = 60, it approaches a local minimum and experience a little increase and then decreases\nslowly again. Comparing with the average clustering coefficient of the tRNA network, the\naverage clustering coefficient crandom of the random network decreases fast while s0 increases,\nwhen s0 > 70, crandom \u2192 0. The behavior of the coefficient of two networks is also illustrated\nin table II. When s0 = 50, creal = 0.777367, crandom = 0.747479; when s > 70, crandom drops\nto zero quickly, but creal decrease slowly. Once again, we proved the real tRNA genes are\nnot randomly selected. The real tRNA genes have close relationships with each other.\nTable III shows the distribution of the average clustering coefficient of 19 tRNA groups\nwhich are classfied by the possible amino acid-accepting. Some groups contain isoacceptor\ntRNA which consist of different tRNA species that bind to alternate codons for the same\namino acid residue. The tRNA group who carries the amino acid residue named Met is\nignored for it contains only one tRNA sequence. Comparing table III with table II, we can\nconclude that the nodes are more likely to connect with the nodes within the same amino\nacid group. The tRNA similarity network can be classified into several large clusters with\nthe same amino acids. It hints that in tRNA genes evolutionary step is much more likely to\n7\n\n\fhappen within the same amino acid group. The cases that a tRNA gene of certain amino\nacid evolve to tRNA gene of another amino acid are rare.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper, we want to show the network model is a powerful tool to study the relationship of tRNA genes. Although some results are not new, such as the real tRNA genes are\nnot random and the relationships among tRNA genes with same anticodon are closer than\nthe relationships among tRNA genes with different anticodons, they are evidences that network model works well for the network model distinguishes these properties clearly. What\nis more, the tRNA similarity network behaves scale-free properties when s0 is large. As we\nknow the scale-free nature is rooted in two generic mechanisms[9]. Firstly scale-free networks\ndescribe open systems that grow by the continuous addition of new nodes. Secondly scalefree networks exhibit preferential attachment that means the likelihood of connecting to a\nnode depends on the node's degree. With these mechanisms, the \"very connected\" nodes in\nscale-free networks usually are added in the network at early time during the growth of the\nnetwork. It has been found that most recent tRNA genes are evolved from a few common\nprecursors[12, 15], and these oldest evolutionary sequences, comparing to the recent tRNA\ngenes. Therefore, in tRNA similarity netwok, the \"very connected\" tRNA genes may have\ndiverged less from their ancestors than weakly connected ones.\nMost recently, many research conclusions show that genes of related function could behave\ntogether as a group in the networks constructed according to their similarity features[3,\n4]. In this paper, although we use the simplest alignment, this property can be found.\nWhen similarity degree s0 is small, nodes of the tRNA genes with the same anticodons are\nconnected to form a local cluster, among them are entirely connected. When s0 increases\nto a large value, a scale-free character emerges that a few nodes compose the core of the\nnetwork and most of nodes have low links. These observations seem to be perfectly fit to\nthe evolutionary processes of the tRNA genes. On the other hand, the oldest tRNA genes\nundergo disturbances such as mutation, loss, insertion, or rearrangement etc. during the\nevolution. Some new tRNA genes are suited for the environment and reserved. So, they\nhave a high similarity to its ancestral sequences. In the network constructed by similarity\ndegree of these tRNA genes, they form local clusters.\n8\n\n\fAn interesting finding of tRNA similarity networks is that some local clusters have high\nconnectivity with the other clusters; or to say, some nodes of one cluster have lots of connections with some nodes of another cluster. See figure 5. It may hint that the evolution\nrelationship of tRNA sequences of two different anitcodons. As shown in figure5(a), the\nnetwork is of two different anticodons: ACG and CCA. The solid circle nodes are the tRNA\ngenes of ACG, and the hollow circle nodes are the tRNA genes of CCA. In this figure, they\nmix into one cluster. Figure 5(b) shows that the network of anticodons TAG and TGA. The\nsolid circle nodes are the tRNA genes of TAG, and the hollow circle nodes are tRNA genes\nof TGA. They appear three clusters in the topology map, and each cluster has some nodes\nwhich highly connect with some nodes of other clusters. It shows that although some tRNA\ngenes have different anticodons, they have high similarities in sequences. In evolutionary\nhistory, the tRNA genes of one anticodon identity can evolve to tRNA genes of another\nidentity. The above finding may be an evidence of this kind of evolutionary mode. In the\nother hand, from figure 1(c), the network of the same anticodon GCC split into two cluster.\nIt hints the evolution process of the tRNA genes of same anticodon may diverge in the\nhistory. Therefore, there are different modes of evolutionary processes, i.e. evolution within\nthe same anticodon groups and evolution among different anticodon groups. The former\nmay be the main part of tRNA evolution. The later may be the key cases of the interaction\namong tRNA of different anticodons during the evolution.\nFor the alignment we used is simply counting the number of cites that are identical,\nit losts many information in the evolution process. More complicated alignment models\nmay exhibit more details of the relationships among tRNA genes. The content of tRNA\ndatabase is limited, the numbers of tRNA sequences from different organisms varied largely.\nTherefore, the biases of taxon samples may influence the topology of the network and the\nresults gotten from the network may not completely reflect the evolution relationship of\ntRNA genes. It is a limitation of network model that will be improved when more tRNA\ngenes are sequenced. Although we did not get many new results from what we have know\nabout the evolution of tRNA genes, the results contribute as proofs that the network model\ncan work well in the research of relationship of tRNA genes and is a useful tool.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThis paper was supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant No.\n10105007, No. 10334020 and No. 90103035. .\n\n[1] Robert F.Weaver, (2001) Molecular Biology (2nd.ed), McGraw-HiH Companies, Inc. 630.\n[2] Robert M.
