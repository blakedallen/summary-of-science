Nuclear effects\non the additional hadron are clearly observed, but with little or no difference among nitrogen,\nkrypton or xenon, and with smaller magnitude than effects seen on previously measured singlehadron multiplicities. The data are compared with models based on partonic energy loss or prehadronic scattering, and with a model based on a purely absorptive treatment of the final state\ninteractions. Thus, the double-hadron ratio provides an additional tool for studying modifications\nof hadronization in nuclear matter.\nPACS numbers: 13.87.Fh, 13.60.-r, 14.20.-c, 25.75.Gz\n\nHadron production from a free nucleon in deepinelastic scattering is generally described by fragmentation functions that contain non-perturbative information about parton hadronization. These functions are\nexpected to be different for nuclear targets [1] because\nof several possible effects: energy loss of the propagating\nquarks, rescattering during the pre-hadronic formation\nprocess or interactions of the final-state hadrons within\nthe nucleus.\nDespite recent accurate experimental data from singlehadron leptoproduction [2, 3] and relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions [4, 5, 6], the underlying mechanisms in theoretical models for hadronization in the nuclear medium\ndiffer greatly [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In-medium modification of\nthe quark fragmentation function has been described in\nterms of rescattering of gluons and quarks, and of energy\nloss due to induced gluon radiation [7, 8]. Alternatively,\ncolorless pre-hadron rescattering in the medium has been\nsuggested [9, 10] with additional effects due to Q2 rescaling [11]. Older interpretations [1, 12] based on hadronic\nfinal-state interactions require a hadron formation length\nsmaller than the nuclear size, which is unlikely for struck\nquarks boosted to energies larger than a few GeV. Although models based on some of these ideas are already in\nconflict with data, clearly other types of data are needed\nto further distinguish among these interpretations.\nDouble-hadron leptoproduction offers an additional\nway to study hadronization. If partonic energy loss of\nthe struck quark were the only mechanism involved, it\nwould be na\u00efvely expected that the attenuation effect\ndoes not depend strongly on the number of hadrons involved, and the double-hadron to single-hadron ratio for\na nuclear target should be only slightly dependent on\nthe mass number A. On the contrary, if final hadron\nabsorption were the dominant process, the requirement\nof an additional slower sub-leading hadron that is more\nstrongly absorbed would suppress the two-hadron yield\nfrom heavier nuclei [9, 13], so that this ratio should decrease with A.\nData from STAR [14] on hadron pair production as\na function of azimuthal angle showed that for a fixed\nvalue of the trigger hadron's transverse momentum, the\nproduction of opposite-side hadron pairs is completely\nsuppressed for central Au+Au collisions due to the final-\n\nstate interactions with the dense medium generated in\nsuch collisions. On the other hand, the same-side pairs\nexhibit jet-like correlations that are similar to p+p and\np+d collisions. These results were used in Ref. [16] to\nadvocate the picture that jet fragmentation occurs outside the dense medium. In this model it has been shown\nthat if hadron absorption or rescattering were responsible for the observed hadron suppression, it would likely\ndestroy the jet structure, and in particular the correlations between leading and sub-leading hadrons within\nthe jet cone. However, the heavy-ion data cannot exclude\nhadronic absorption effects completely.\nIn this paper the first measurement of double-hadron\nleptoproduction on nitrogen, krypton and xenon relative\nto deuterium is presented. All charged hadrons and \u03c0 0\nmesons are considered.\nSemi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering data are presented in terms of the ratio\n\nR2h (z2 ) =\n\n( dN\n(\n\nz1 >0.5\n\n(z2 )/dz2\nN z1 >0.5\nz\n>0.5\ndN 1\n(z2 )/dz2\nN z1 >0.5\n\n)A\n)D\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nin which z = Eh /\u03bd is the fractional hadronic energy, Eh\nis the hadron energy and \u03bd is the virtual photon energy,\nall of which are evaluated in the target rest frame. The\nvalues z1 and z2 correspond to the leading (largest z)\nand sub-leading (second largest z) hadrons, respectively.\nThe quantity dN z1 >0.5 is the number of events with at\nleast two detected hadrons in a bin of width dz2 at z2\nwith z1 > 0.5. The quantity N z1 >0.5 is the number of\nevents with at least one detected hadron with z1 > 0.5.\nThe label A(D) indicates that the term is calculated for\na nuclear (deuterium) target.\nThe measurement was performed with the HERMES\nspectrometer [18] using the 27.6 GeV positron beam\nstored in the HERA ring at DESY. The spectrometer\nconsists of two identical halves located above and below\nthe positron beam pipe. The scattered positrons and the\nproduced hadrons were detected simultaneously within\nan angular acceptance of \u00b1 170 mrad horizontally, and\n\u00b1 (40 \u2013 140) mrad vertically.\nThe nuclear targets, which were internal to the\npositron storage ring, consisted of polarized or unpolarized deuterium, or unpolarized high-density nitrogen,\n\n\f3\n\nR2h\n\ndecay is larger. In both Selections I and II the relative\nyield from exclusive \u03c10 production in N z1 >0.5 is small\nand was evaluated by Monte Carlo calculation to be on\nthe order of 12% for the deuterium target.\n\nR2h\n\nkrypton or xenon gas injected into a 40 cm long openended tubular storage cell. Target areal densities up\nto 1.4 \u00d7 1016 nucleons/cm2 were obtained for unpolarized gas corresponding to luminosities up to 3 \u00d7 1033\nnucleons/(cm2 s).\nThe positron trigger was formed by a coincidence\nbetween the signals from three scintillator hodoscope\nplanes, and a lead glass calorimeter where a minimum\nenergy deposit of 3.5 GeV (1.4 GeV) for unpolarized\n(polarized) target runs was required. The scattered\npositrons were identified using a transition-radiation detector, a scintillator pre-shower counter, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. Scattered positrons were selected by imposing constraints on the squared fourmomentum of the virtual photon Q2 > 1 GeV2 , on\nthe invariant mass of the photon-nucleon system W =\np\n2M \u03bd + M 2 \u2212 Q2 >2 GeV where M is the nucleon\nmass, and on the energy fraction of the virtual photon\ny = \u03bd/E < 0.85 where E is the beam energy. The constraints on W and y are applied to exclude nucleon resonance excitations and to limit the magnitude of the radiative corrections, respectively. In addition the requirement \u03bd >7 GeV was imposed to limit the kinematical\ncorrelations between \u03bd and z.\nCharged hadrons (i.e. \u03c0, K and p without distinction)\nwere reconstructed for momenta above 1.4 GeV. The electromagnetic calorimeter [19] provided neutral pion identification through the detection of neutral clusters originating from two-photon decay. Each of the two clusters\nwas required to have an energy E\u03b3 \u2265 0.8 GeV. The \u03c0 0\nmesons were selected by requiring that the reconstructed\ninvariant mass was within two standard deviations of the\ncenter of the \u03c0 0 mass peak.\nThe leading hadron was selected with z1 >0.5. In this\ncase, it is expected to contain the struck current quark\nwith high probability. No explicit constraint was applied\nto z2 . Both z1 and z2 were calculated assuming that all\nhadrons have the mass of the pion.\nUsing the code of Ref. [20], radiative corrections to\nR2h were found to be negligible in the whole kinematic\nrange. This is because there is no elastic or quasi-elastic\ntail in semi-inclusive events, and the inelastic corrections\nlargely cancel in the measured ratio.\nTwo methods of double-hadron event selection were\nused. Selection I contains only the combinations of\nhadron charges (leading-subleading) ++, \u2212\u2212, +0, 0+,\n\u22120, 0\u2212, 00. This suppresses the contributions from\n\u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay because the +\u2212 and \u2212+ combinations\nare missing. Moreover, in the Lund string model, the\nexclusion of the opposite-charge combinations enhances\nthe rank-1 (leading) plus rank-3 (sub-leading) combination [21]. The higher the particle rank, the more likely it\nis formed deep inside the nucleus, and the corresponding\nhadron absorption should be larger. Selection II contains\nall particle charge combinations. Here, the sub-leading\nhadron is mainly of rank-2 and the contribution from \u03c10\n\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nz2\nFIG. 1: The ratio R2h as a function of z2 for 14 N (squares),\nKr (circles) and Xe (triangles) with z1 >0.5. Only Selection\nI was considered. The systematical uncertainty is 2% for all\nthe targets and is independent of z2 . In the upper panel\nthe curves (solid for 14 N, dashed for Kr, dotted for Xe) are\ncalculated within a BUU transport model [10]. In the bottom\npanel the same data are shown with calculations that assume\nonly absorption for the three nuclei (same line types as in the\nupper plot) [10].\n\nFig. 1 shows the double ratio R2h as a function of z2 for\nSelection I only. The kinematic variables are in the range\nh\u03bdi=21 to 16 GeV and hQ2 i=2.1 to 2.6 GeV2 as z2 goes\nfrom 0.09 to 0.44. The averages over z2 are h\u03bdi =17.7\nGeV and hQ2 i =2.4 GeV2 .\nThe ratio R2h is generally below unity with no significant difference between the three nuclei. These data\nclearly show that the nuclear effect in the double-hadron\nratio is much smaller than for the single-hadron attenuation measured under the same kinematic conditions\n[2, 3]. For z2 <0.1, where R2h rises towards and possibly\nabove 1, the slow hadrons originate largely from target\nfragmentation [10, 22]. Also for z2 >0.4, where the two\nhadrons have similar energy, R2h seems to rise towards\n\n\fR2h\n\n4\n\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nThe curves in Fig. 2 represent the model [16, 17] in\nwhich modifications of the fragmentation functions arises\nfrom parton energy loss. Contrary to na\u00efve expectations,\nthis model predicts a significant A-dependence, in conflict\nwith the data.\nTable I provides a quantitative comparison between\nthe data and theoretical predictions for R2h integrated\nover z2 .\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nz2\nFIG. 2: The ratio R2h as a function of z2 for 14 N (squares),\nKr (circles) and Xe (triangles) with z1 >0.5 for Selection II.\nThe systematic uncertainty is 4% (3%) for xenon and krypton\n(nitrogen) and is independent of z2 . The curves (14 N: solid;\nKr: dashed; Xe: dotted) are from the parton energy loss\nmodel described in Refs.[16, 17].\n\nunity.\nFig. 1 (upper panel) shows calculations based on a\nPYTHIA event generator with a fully coupled-channel\ntreatment of final-state interactions by means of a BUU\ntransport model [10]. In this model, the fragmentation function is modified by pre-hadron interactions and\nrescattering in the medium. Although the general trend\nof the data is reproduced, the model predicts an effect\ntwice as large for xenon and krypton as for nitrogen above\nz2 =0.1, which is not supported by the data.\nFig. 1 (bottom panel) shows the same data compared\nto a calculation with a purely absorptive treatment of\nthe interaction of the pre-hadronic or the final hadronic\nstates. The data rule out this assumption [10].\nFig. 2 presents R2h calculated for all hadron charge\ncombinations (Selection II). Inclusion of the +\u2212 and \u2212+\npairs does not change the value of R2h significantly, contrary to all of the na\u00efve space-time evolutionary models of\nhadronization. In order to evaluate further the possible\ninfluence of the exclusive and semi-inclusive \u03c10 production, R2h was extracted for all hadron pairs except those\nwith invariant mass near the \u03c10 . This has no noticeable\neffect on R2h . Therefore, the final data are presented\nover the full invariant mass range. The effect of only\nthe exclusive \u03c10 production is even smaller since it contributes only 5% of the total yield. The contamination\nfrom exclusive production of \u03c1\u00b1 and \u03c9 mesons is completely negligible, being suppressed by more than one\norder of magnitude with respect to the \u03c10 [15].\n\nThe total systematic uncertainty on R2h is 4% (3%) for\nxenon and krypton (nitrogen) and is nearly independent\nof z2 . The main contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the decay of exclusively produced \u03c10\nmesons. However, for the double-hadron multiplicities\ndN z1 >0.5 (z2 )/dz2 the \u03c10 contribution has a negligible effect. The \u03c10 contribution to N z1 >0.5 was estimated in\nanalogy with Ref.[2, 3] to be about 2% (3%) for light\n(heavy) nuclei. The only other contributing factor is the\nuncertainty in the overall efficiency of 2%. The geometric\nacceptance for semi-inclusive hadron production was verified to be the same for both the nuclear and deuterium\ntargets by studying the multiplicity ratio as a function\nof the hadron polar angle. This ratio is constant within\nexperimental error.\nIn conclusion, the first measurement of double-hadron\nproduction on deuterium, nitrogen, krypton and xenon\nis presented. The ratio of double- to single-hadron yields\nfrom nuclear targets compared to deuterium are similar for atomic mass numbers A=14, 84 and 131, as a\nfunction of the relative energy of the sub-leading hadron.\nThis is at variance with the single-hadron attenuation\ndata, which depend strongly on A. The data do not support na\u00efve expectations for pre-hadronic and hadronic\nfinal-state interactions that are purely absorptive. Models that interpret modifications to fragmentation as being due to pre-hadronic scattering or partonic energy loss\nare also inconsistent with the data. In fact the latter predict an even larger A-dependence, while the data show\nlittle. Like the jet correlation measurements in heavyion collisions, the double-hadron observables in semiinclusive deep inelastic scattering provide new information for differentiating between models of hadronization\nin nuclei that are indistinguishable in single-hadron measurements.\n\nWe are grateful to T.Falter, B.Kopeliovich,\nA.Majumder and X.N.Wang for useful discussions.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the DESY management for\nits support, the staff at DESY and the collaborating\ninstitutions for their significant effort, and our national\nfunding agencies and the EU RII3-CT-2004-506078\nprogram for financial support.\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Averaged values of R2h for z1 >0.5.\nz2 <0.5\n14\nN/D\nSelection I\n14\nN/D\nSelection II\nKr/D\nSelection I\nKr/D\nSelection II\nXe/D\nSelection I\nXe/D\nSelection II\n\n0.1< z2 <0.5\n\n0.1< z2 <0.5 0.1< z2 <0.5\n0.1< z2 <0.5\nModel [10] Model Abs.
