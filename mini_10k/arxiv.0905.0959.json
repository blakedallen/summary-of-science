Introduction\nThe interaction of solid particles with gas in protoplanetary\ndisks is one of the key mechanisms for planetesimals and\nplanet formation. Moreover, this fundamental process gets more\nand more attention for other astrophysical media (interstellar\nmedium, planetary atmospheres, etc.) as grains can dampen\nfluid motions and be the targets of adsorption and condensation\nof molecules and can be the base for complex chemistry, e.g.,\nthe formation of the molecule H2 in the interstellar medium.\nWith the advance of observational facilities and techniques, dust\ndynamics is understood more and more as a crucial process\nfor most media, while, due to the discrete nature of grains,\nmodelling their dynamics remains tricky.\nThere are two main methods for computing the dynamics\nof particles embedded in a fluid. One can either study a\nlarge number of individual particles using N-body techniques\nor consider the particles as a fluid, which is treated with a\nmodified Navier-Stokes/Euler equation. While the first method\nis reliable and precise, it can only be applied to a finite (and\nin fact limited) number of particles; therefore, macroscopic\nquantities reconstructed from the N-Body simulations outputs\nare sometimes inaccurate due to a low sampling of the phase\nspace. The second method enables one to consider an almost\ninfinite ensemble of particles by computing their macroscopic properties (density, velocity field, etc.). This makes the\n\"two-fluid\" approach (gas and solids) the preferred method of\ntreating the dynamics and growth of solid particles in a fluid,\nespecially in the planet formation community. Consequently,\na dense and rich literature is based on this approach, and\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nFranck\nFranck.Hersant@obs.u-bordeaux1.fr\n\nHersant\n\ne-mail:\n\nmany fundamental mechanisms of planetary formation have\nbeen unraveled (e.g. Cuzzi et al. 1993; Dubrulle et al. 1995;\nStepinski & Valageas 1996; Barri\u00e8re-Fouchet et al. 2005;\nInaba et al. 2005; Fromang & Papaloizou 2006; Johansen et al.\n2006).\nThe two-fluid approach is usually implemented by introducing two Euler equations, coupled through the gas drag force.\nMoreover, in the fluid equation for particles, the pressure term\nis usually ignored. This approximation is often justified by the\nstatement that collisions between particles and gas are much\nmore probable than collisions between particles making the\npressure term negligible compared to the gas drag force.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to question the validity\nof ignoring the pressure of the particle fluid by computing\nit in the very simple case of particles settling in a disk. The\nvertical dynamics of a solid body in a disk can be understood\nas a damped oscillator. In a Keplerian disk, if gas is absent or\nvery tenuous, the particle oscillates around the midplane at a\nfrequency equal to the orbital frequency (the oscillation comes\nfrom inclined orbits). The friction with the gas damps this\noscillation, as the particle feels a \"headwind\" when it crosses\nthe gas disk. Like any damped oscillator, there are two regimes:\nan underdamped regime for low damping and an overdamped\nregime, where the particle has no time to oscillate for a full\nperiod. This occurs for high damping rates.\nWe can compute the pressure of the solid fluid embedded\nin a laminar gas disk by solving exactly the collisionless\nBoltzmann (or Vlasov) equation for the phase space density of\nparticles. As we show, as soon as the particles are larger than\nsome critical size, the pressure cannot be neglected. This work\n\n\f2\n\nF. Hersant: On the pressure of collisionless particle fluids (RN)\n\nextends the work of Garaud et al. (2004), who comes to similar\nconclusions based on asymptotic calculations.\nIn Sect. 2 is developed the general formalism. Section 3 is\ndevoted to a very simple test case that can be used to check the\nvalidity of more general solutions and intuit how the pressure\nvaries. In Sect. 4, the exact general solution of the Vlasov equation is given. In Sect. 5, this solution is applied to a special case\nthat retains most of the expected general properties. A surprisingly simple solution is found for the pressure and the scaling\nlaws, and asymptotics are discussed. In Sect. 6, we discuss our\nresults and their implications for more complex and turbulent\nflows and give our conclusions.\n\n2. General formalism\nWe consider the equation for the evolution of the phase space\ndensity in 1+1 dimensions (one in space, one in velocity) under\nthe action of a drag force from an inert fluid. This is not exactly\nthe common collisionless Boltzmann or Vlasov equation, as the\ndrag force is not conservative. Instead, the general Vlasov equation with non-conservative forces takes the form (see e.g. Lutsko\n1997; Carballido et al. 2006; Youdin & Lithwick 2007):\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202 \u0012F \u0013\n+u\n+\nf =0\n(1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202z \u2202u m\nwhere z is the space coordinate, u is the velocity coordinate, F/m\nthe non-conservative force per mass (acceleration), and f the\nphase space density (or probability density function). When f\nis known, the macroscopic quantities (density, velocity, energy)\nare moments of the distribution f . In particular, the zeroth order\nmoment is the density n(z, t):\nZ +\u221e\nn(z, t) =\nf (z, u, t)du,\n(2)\n\npath of the underlying gas. It should, however, be noted that\nthe mean free path lm f p in a circumstellar disk is very large,\n\u00115/2\n\u0010\ncm, assuming that\ntypically varying like lm f p = 108 100RAU\n\u0011\u22125/2\n\u0010\n8\ncm\u22123\nthe gas number density ng varies like ng = 10 100RAU\n(Guilloteau & Dutrey 1998; Hersant et al. 2005).\nUnder these conditions, Eq. (1) becomes\n\u0012\nu\u0013\n\u2202t f + u\u2202z f \u2212 \u2202u \u03c92 z +\nf =0\n\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere z is now the vertical space variable and u the vertical ve\u2202\nlocity. To simplify the notations, we use the convention \u2202 x = \u2202x\n.\nThis equation can be developed into pure advective terms:\n\u0012\nu\u0013\nf\n\u2202t f + u\u2202z f \u2212 \u03c92 z + \u2202u f \u2212 = 0\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\n(6)\n\nThe last term on the lefthand side (\u2212 f /\u03c4) is the difference\nwith a Vlasov equation for conservative forces and deserves\nsome comments. This term induces an exponential growth of\nf . Without solving the equation, one can understand that the\nconservation of the number of particles (following from Eq. 1),\nrequires that the surface of the phase space field of density f has\nto collapse in one direction so that, at infinite times, the field of\nf tends to a discontinuous distribution, consisting of a family of\ncurves, but nothing like a continuous surface. This property of\nthe equation remains valid even in 3+3 dimensions and with gas\nturbulence.\nAt this point, it is convenient to adimension the time, introducing two new variables t\u2032 = \u03c9t and u\u2032 = u/\u03c9. Using these new\nvariables and omitting the primes for clarity, we get\n\u0012\nu\u0013\nf\n\u2202t f + u\u2202z f \u2212 z +\n\u2202u f \u2212 = 0\nS\nS\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(7)\n\nthe first-order moment is the momentum (the product of the density by the macroscopic velocity \u0169)\nZ +\u221e\nu f (z, u, t)du,\n(3)\nn(z, t) \u0169(z, t) =\n\nwhere S = \u03c9\u03c4 is a Stokes number of the problem. For small\n(large) particles, S is small (large) due to the strong (weak)\ncoupling of the particles with the fluid.\n\nand the second-order moment is related to the pressure (a scalar\nin 1D):\n\nWe now can artificially get rid of the exponential growth\nterm by defining\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nP(z, t) =\n=\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nZ\u2212\u221e\n+\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(u \u2212 \u0169)2 f (z, u, t)du\n2\n\n\u03c8 = f e\u2212t/S\n\n(8)\n\n\u0012\nu\u0013\n\u2202t \u03c8 + u\u2202z\u03c8 \u2212 z +\n\u2202u \u03c8 = 0\nS\n\n(9)\n\nand finally get\n2\n\nu f (z, u, t)du \u2212 n\u0169 .\n\n(4)\n\nIn the case of particles settling in a disk, there are two\nforces: gravity and gas drag. When the disk is geometrically\nthin, the vertical gravity can be written as mF = \u2212\u03c92 z, where\n\u03c9 is the orbital frequency, while the drag force, in the absence\nof gas motions, can be written as mF = \u2212u/\u03c4 where \u03c4 is the\nso-called stopping time (Whipple 1972). This is the characteristic timescale for a particle to stop in a fluid. Here, we\nconsider \u03c4 as a free parameter, which would in general depend\nupon the particle size, morphology, density, the density of the\ngas, and the turbulent intensity in the grain trail. Here, we\nconsider it as independent of both space and velocity. This\nis an important simplification, corresponding to the so-called\nEpstein regime, where grains are smaller than the mean free\n\nThe behavior of this equation is rather easy to foresee. For infinite S , the remaining terms correspond to a rotation in phase\nspace. This rotation is a direct consequence of energy conservation. In real space, particles oscillate around the midplane with\nzero velocity at the highest absolute altitude and maximum velocity when particles cross the midplane. The gas-drag term induces a collapse along the velocity axis. The net outcome of both\nthe rotation and the collapse along the velocity axis (which corresponds in the real space to the dampening by gas drag of the\ninclination of the particle orbit) is a global collapse towards the\ncenter of the phase space (z = 0, u = 0), but not a spherical\ncollapse.\n\n\fF. Hersant: On the pressure of collisionless particle fluids (RN)\n\n3\n\n3. Simple case\n\n5. Particular case for the initial conditions\n\nAlthough the general solution is given in the next section, it is\nuseful to solve Eq. (9) in the simplest case: infinitely large or\nmassive particles (S = +\u221e). In this case, the equation admits a\nsimple stationary solution with separated variables:\n\nComputing the moments of the phase space distribution cannot\nbe done without the initial conditions. Here, we choose an initial\ncondition composed of Gaussians, with one Gaussian per dimension, which is relevant to most physically meaningful cases:\n\n\u03c8 = Ke\n\n2 +u2\n2\u03c32\n\n\u2212z\n\n.\n\n\u03c6(z, u) = Ke\n\n(10)\n\nUsing the definition of the moments, the pressure is straightforward:\nP(z) = n(z)\u03c32 .\n\n(11)\n\n\u221a\nz2\nn(z) = K\u03c3 2\u03c0e\u2212 2\u03c32 .\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the density is\n\nEquation (11) is similar to an equation of state for isothermal\nfluids, where \u03c3 plays the role of a (constant) sound speed. As we\nwill see in Sect. 5, this behavior remains valid even in more general cases. With the equation of state (11), solution (12) is the\nresult of the hydrostatic equilibrium of an isothermal gas, the\npressure force balancing the vertical gravity. The stationary solution (10) being even in u, it corresponds to a zero macroscopic\nvelocity. In this case, where particles have an infinite inertia, the\npressure term is thus dominant in the structure of the particle\ndisk.\n\n4.

The normalization constant K is related to the surface density \u03a3 by\n\u03a3 = 2\u03c0K\u03c3z \u03c3u . This initial condition assumes that the particles\ninitially have a vanishing mean velocity, a velocity dispersion\nand are randomly distributed vertically, following a Gaussian\ndistribution in this case. Other choices would lead to similar results unless the symmetry with respect to the disk midplane is\nbroken (particles initially located only in the upper half of the\ndisk, for example).\n\nL(z, t) =\n\u03c8(z, u, t) = \u03c6 (z0 (z, u, t), u0(z, u, t))\n\n\u2212\n\nHere we keep the p-dependence explicitly as it will be useful in\nthe following.

(2004).\nIt is interesting to note that the general pressure only depends\non z through the density. The Euler equation for the particle fluid\ninvolves only gradients of the pressure so this gradient is in fact\ndirectly proportional to the density gradient. In other words, the\nparticles seem to follow a barotropic equation of state. This behavior seems closely related to the assumption of constant stopping time (Garaud et al. 2004).\n5.2. Scaling and asymptotics\n5.2.1. Case \u03b2 real (small particles)\n\nWhen \u03b2 is real (and positive), \u03b1 is large, it is easy to check that\n\u03bb is a decreasing function of time. Its initial value is\n\u03bb(0) = \u03c3u ,\n\n(33)\n\nand the large time asymptotics are\n\u03bb(t \u2192 +\u221e) \u223c q\n\n1+\n\n\u03b2\u03c3z\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u00112\nz\n\n\u03c3u\n\ne\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2)t .\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2)\n\n(34)\n\n2\n\nStarting from a presumably very low value (the initial velocity dispersion of particles), \u03bb decreases with time, asymptotically\nlike an exponential. The location where the pressure decreases\nthe least is the midplane, since the density tends to a Dirac function when times goes to infinity,\n\n\u221a\nn(z = 0, t) = K\u03bb 2\u03c0e2\u03b1t ,\n\n(35)\n\nand\n\u221a\nP(z = 0, t) = \u03bb3 K 2\u03c0e2\u03b1t\n\uf8f63\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212(\u03b1+3\u03b2)t\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u03b2\u03c3z\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 e\n\uf8ec\n\u223c \uf8ec\uf8ec q\n.\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u00112\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n2\uf8f7\nz\n1 + \u03c3u (\u03b1 + \u03b2) \uf8f8\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\nEven in the midplane, the pressure quickly drops with time,\nstarting from a low value. In this case, as has long been known\n(see e.g. Cuzzi et al. 1993; Dubrulle et al. 1995; Garaud et al.\n2004), it is safe to neglect the pressure of the particle fluid.\nConsequently, particles steadily sediment towards the disk midplane at a velocity close to the terminal velocity w\u221e = \u03c92 z\u03c4\n(defined as the asymptotic velocity of any body free-falling in a\nfluid), which is the asymptotic velocity of both the particle fluid\nand individual particles here.\n5.2.2. Case \u03b2 imaginary (large particles)\n\nWe define \u03b3 such that \u03b2 = i\u03b3. In such a case, \u03bb can be written as\n\u03bb = e\u2212\u03b1t r\n\n\u03c3u\n\u0010\n\u0011 2 \u0010 \u00112\ncos \u03b3t + \u03b1\u03b3 sin \u03b3t + \u03c3\u03c3uz\n\n(38)\n1\nsin2\n\u03b32\n\n\u03b3t\n\nFor small initial velocity dispersions, the location of the maxima\nof \u03bb corresponds to\n\u03b1\n(39)\ntan \u03b3t = \u2212\n\u03b3\nand the amplitude of these maxima is\nq\n\u03b3\n\u03bbmax (t) = \u03c3z\n\u03b12 + \u03b32 e\u2212\u03b1t .\n\u03b1\n\n(40)\n\nIt is crucial to note here that the amplitude of the maxima of\nthe time-dependent velocity dispersion \u03bb is independent of the\ninitial velocity dispersion \u03c3u . The velocity dispersion is created\nand maintained by the vertical gravity.\nSince the midplane density is still given by Eq. (35), we get\nthe amplitude of the midplane pressure maxima:\n!3\nq\n\u221a\n\u03b3\nPmax (t) = K 2\u03c0 \u03c3z\n\u03b12 + \u03b32 . e\u2212\u03b1t\n(41)\n\u03b1\nThese pressure maxima have a much lower decreasing rate than\nin the non-oscillating case, both because it involves only \u03b1 here\nand because \u03b1 has a lower value.\nThe midplane pressure as a function of time for different\nvalues of the Stokes number S is displayed in Fig. 1. The\ntransition between the case with oscillation S > 1/2 and the\noverdamped case S < 1/2 appears very clearly. The pressure is\ncomputed for a ratio \u03c3\u03c3uz = 0.1. This ratio defines the pressure at\nt = 0 and the width of the maxima, but neither the amplitude of\nthe maxima nor the decreasing rate.\nFigure 1 illustrates that, while the pressure of the solids fluid\ncan be safely neglected for small values of the Stokes number\nS , the situation is drastically different when the Stokes number\n\n\fF.

Pressure of the particle fluid in the midplane as a function\nof the dimensionless time (\u03c9t), for different values of the Stokes\nnumber S\n\nreaches S = 1/2. When particles oscillate around the midplane,\nthe fluid macroscopic velocity is different from the terminal velocity w\u221e as the macroscopic pressure force slows down the vertical contraction of the particle fluid. In other words, the velocity\nof the particle fluid is not that of individual particles and the fluid\nhas a nonvanishing internal energy (contrary to the case for small\nparticles).\n\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nWe have shown that, in general, the pressure of the particle fluid\ncannot be neglected as soon as their Stokes number is more than\n0.5. The particles seen as a fluid can have an internal energy,\nand the pressure force can partly balance gravity. In the extreme\ncase where particles have an infinite inertia, the structure of the\nparticle fluid is in fact hydrostatic. The existence of pressure is\ncompletely independent of the presence or absence of collisions\nbetween solid particles. Instead, the pressure is the result of a\nvelocity dispersion. While velocity dispersion can be the result\nof collisions, it can also be created dynamically when external\nforces excite the velocity dispersion (gravity in the present case)\nor when the flow itself is converging locally. Even though our\nresults concern only a very simple and specific problem, they\nhave implications for a much broader variety of astrophysical\nand non-astrophysical flows.\nThe Stokes number can be defined in a more general way as\nthe ratio of a dynamical timescale, creating velocity differences\nbetween the solids and the underlying fluid (gas or liquid), and\nthe stopping time, the characteristic timescale for the particles to\nreach the fluid velocity. There are many processes able to create\nvelocity differences between the gas and solids, gravity being\nonly one of them. For example, when two rivers join, particles\nembedded in the rivers do not see the confluence like the water\ndoes and this can create a velocity difference between water and\nthe particles, and a velocity dispersion in the particle flow at the\nconfluence.\n\n5\n\nFor particles embedded in a turbulent flow, it is common to\ndefine a scale-dependent Stokes number by S \u03b7 = \u03c4/t\u03b7 , where t\u03b7\nis the turnover time of a turbulent eddy of size \u03b7. This Stokes\nnumber depends on the size of the turbulent eddy and scales as\nS \u03b7 \u221d \u03b72/3 for Kolmogorov-like turbulence (see e.g. Cuzzi et al.\n2001). The smallest reachable eddy is dependent on the strength\nof turbulence, quantified by the Reynolds number of the flow\nRe = UL\n\u03bd , where U and L are characteristic velocities and\nlength scale, respectively, and \u03bd is the molecular kinematic\nviscosity of the fluid. For Kolmogorov turbulence, the smallest\nturbulent scale \u03b7min of the flow scales as \u03b7min \u221d Re\u22123/4 . For\nflows with large enough Reynolds numbers (many astrophysical\nand geophysical flows reach Reynolds numbers over 1010 ), the\nsmallest turbulent scales have S \u03b7 smaller than 1, even for small\ngrains. This is a well-known behavior of particle-laden flows.\nParticles are centrifuged out of the turbulent eddies when their\nscale Stokes number reaches unity (Squires & Eaton 1991). This\ncreates a converging flow of particles towards regions of low\nvorticity. Consequently, this induces a velocity dispersion inside\nthe particle flow and, for similar reasons to those described in\nthis paper, the particle fluid develops a pressure. As a side note,\nwhen turbulence modelling is considered, turbulent pressure\nterms can arise from fluctuating or subgrid velocity dispersions\n(Dobrovolskis et al. 1999). However, turbulent pressure terms\nare a consequence of Reynolds averaging or spatial filtering\nand disappear when turbulence is directly simulated instead of\nmodelled.\nThis is hopefully a good illustration of the care one has\nto take whenever a fluid equation is applied to a collection of\nsolid particles in an astrophysical flow. Whenever any dynamical timescale becomes smaller than the characteristic coupling\ntimescale between the particles and the underlying fluid, the particles cannot be considered as a pressureless fluid, whatever the\ncollision rate between particles.\nAcknowledgements.
