They proposed that point defects in\na 4 He crystal may become quantum at low temperatures and form a Bose condensate.\nThe possibility of superfluid solids (\"supersolids\") was also conjectured in Refs. [2, 3]. For\na long time, the experimental search for a supersolid phase of helium was unsuccessful.\nRecently, however, Kim and Chan claimed that superfluid behavior may have been observed\nin solid 4 He [4, 5]. This has stimulated renewed interest in the supersolid phase. The\nsuperfluid fraction was found in Ref. [5] to be of order 10\u22122 , considerably larger than what\nwas theoretically expected (. 10\u22124 [3]).\nIn the following, we assume that the supersolid phase does indeed occur. We shall not\ndiscuss the microscopic origin of such a behavior. Rather, we concentrate our attention\non the theoretical description of the low-energy dynamics of the supersolid phase. One can\nexpect that, regardless of the details of the microscopic mechanism underlying the supersolid\nstate, its low-energy dynamics is simple and universal, and is dictated by symmetry principles\nalone. This is because the low-energy degrees of freedom of supersolids are the Nambu\u2013\nGoldstone bosons arising from spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry and the\nU(1) symmetry generated by the conserved particle number. In fact, Andreev and Lifshitz\nhave constructed the hydrodynamic equations describing a supersolid (in the limit of small\nstrain), based on conservation laws and Galilean invariance only.\nIn this Letter, we restrict ourselves to zero temperature and derive an alternative description of supersolids based on a low-energy effective Lagrangian [6]. Such a description\nis possible since dissipative effects disappear at T = 0. The effective Lagrangian description\nholds several advantages over the one based on the hydrodynamic equations. As it is generally true, the Lagrangian formulation enables straightforward application of field-theoretical\ntechniques such as Feynman diagrams. In our particular case, the Lagrangian also elucidates\nthe appearance of a certain \"topological\" interaction term, which is important in processes\ninvolving defects.\nThe form of the effective Lagrangian is constrained by various symmetries, among which\nan important role is played by the Galilean invariance. For liquid superfluids, the most\ngeneral Galilean-invariant effective Lagrangian was constructed by Greiter, Wilczek, and\nWitten [7]. For supersolids the possible structures appearing in the Lagrangian is richer\nthan in supersolid 4 He, but are still rather restrictive.\n2\n\n\fDegrees of freedom.-The fields appearing in the effective Lagrangian are the four Goldstone bosons which appear due to the spontaneous breaking of the U(1) particle number\nsymmetry and the translational symmetry along three spatial directions. One of these fields\nis therefore the phase of the superfluid condensate, \u03b8; under the action of the particle number, it transforms as \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03b1.\n\nThe three remaining fields are translation-breaking scalars X a , a = 1, 2, 3, which can be\n\nintroduced as follows [8]. Imagine a system of coordinates X a , a = 1, 2, 3 which is frozen in\nthe body of the solid. (The choice of the system is completely arbitrary, but for simplicity\none can choose it to coincide with the coordinates in our reference frame xi , i = 1, 2, 3 if\nthe solid is at equilibrium at some arbitrarily chosen external pressure P0 .) When the solid\nmoves, this system of coordinates also moves, so if one follows one particular material point\nin the solid, its coordinates in the X system remain constant. In general, the coordinate\nsystem X is curved. The time history of the solid is completely characterized by three\nfunctions X a (t, x), which give the coordinates, in the comoving frame, of the material point\nthat is located at the position x at time t. X a (t, x) are the fields that enter the effective\ntheory together with the U(1) phase \u03b8.\nOne can expand the fields around the ground state\nX a = xa \u2212 ua ,\n\n\u03b8 = \u03bc0 t \u2212 \u03c6,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 and ua fluctuate around zero. Here \u03bc0 is the chemical potential at pressure P0 ; ua\nis the usual displacement vector. The superfluid velocity and the strain of the crystal are\nrelated to the first spatial derivatives of \u03b8 and X a :\nvs =\n\n1\n\u2207\u03c6,\nm\n\n\u2202i X a = \u03b4ia \u2212 \u2202i ua\n\n(2)\n\n(in most of this Letter, ~ = 1).\nThe density of lattice sites is a constant in X space. We denote this constant by n0 . In\nthe x space, the density of lattice sites is\nn0 det |\u2202i X a | =\n\nn0\n\u01ebijk \u01ebabc \u2202i X a \u2202j X b \u2202k X c .\n6\n\n(3)\n\nFor an ordinary crystal, nonsuperfluid and without defects, this coincides with the particle\nnumber density.\nDerivative expansion.-The effective Lagrangian should be invariant under the U(1) particle number symmetry, \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + \u03b1, and coordinate shift in the frozen frame, X a \u2192 X a + \u03b1a .\n3\n\n\fThus the Lagrangian contains only time and coordinate derivatives of \u03b8 and X a , but not \u03b8\nor X a by themselves.\nIn order to discuss the low-energy regime, we follow the standard effective field theory\nphilosophy and perform a derivative expansion of the effective Lagrangian. Because \u03b8 and\nX a do not appear without derivatives, there are two different ways to perform the derivative\nexpansion. One possibility is to assume that \u03b8 and X a are slowly varying functions of space\nand time. Alternatively, one can assume that the first (temporal and spatial) derivatives of\n\u03b8 and X a vary slowly. Clearly, the second alternative is more general, since it allows for the\nfirst derivatives of \u03b8 and X a to be large. In particular, the superfluid velocity and the strain\nof the crystal do not have to be small. In our subsequent discussion, we will therefore assume\nthat \u03b8\u0307, \u2202i \u03b8, \u1e8a a and \u2202i X a may be not small, but vary slowly in space and time over distances\nlarge compared to all microscopic length scales, such as the superfluid healing length.\nKeeping only leading-order terms in the derivative expansion, the Lagrangian is a function\nof the first derivatives of fields,\nL = L(\u03b8\u0307, \u2202i \u03b8, \u1e8a a , \u2202i X a ).\n\n(4)\n\nThis Lagrangian, in general, contains terms to all orders of fields. In each term in the series\nexpansion over fields \u03b8 and X a , one keeps the lowest possible number of derivatives equal to\nthe number of fields.\nRotational invariance.-The effective Lagrangian should be invariant under spatial rotations. The fields X a , despite being a three-component field, transform under spatial\nrotations like scalar fields. This is because X a are the coordinates of the internal system\nfrozen in the solid body, which are not rotated with the axes of spatial coordinates xi . Therefore the Lagrangian (4) is a function of the following rotationally invariant combinations of\narguments,\nL = L(\u03b8\u0307, \u1e8a a , (\u2202i \u03b8)2 , \u2202i \u03b8\u2202i X a , uab ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we introduce the notation\nuab = \u2202i X a \u2202i X b = \u03b4 ab \u2212 \u2202a ub \u2212 \u2202b ua + \u2202i ua \u2202i ub .\n\n(6)\n\nIt can be shown that any rotationally invariant function of first derivatives of \u03b8 and X a can\n\n4\n\n\fbe written as a function of the parameters staying in Eq. (5). In particular,\n\u221a\n\u01ebijk \u2202i X a \u2202j X b \u2202k X c = \u01ebabc det u ,\n\u221a\nd\n\u01ebijk \u2202i \u03b8\u2202j X a \u2202k X b = \u01ebabc det u u\u22121\ncd \u2202i \u03b8\u2202i X ,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\u22121\nwhere det u is the determinant of the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix uab , and uab\nis the inverse matrix of u:\n\nu\u22121\nab ubc = \u03b4ac .\n\nGalilean invariance.-Further constraints on the effective Lagrangian follow from\nGalilean invariance. In a nonrelativistic theory where all particles have the same mass,\nthe momentum density is proportional to the particle number flux,\nT 0i = mj i ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the 4 He atom. The momentum density and the particle number flux\nare found from the Lagrangian by using Noether's theorem,\nT 0i = \u2212\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2202i X a ,\n\u2202i \u03b8 \u2212\na\n\u2202 \u1e8a\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0307\n\nji =\n\n\u2202L\n.\n\u2202(\u2202i \u03b8)\n\n(10)\n\nThe most general form of the Lagrangian which is consistent with rotational [Eq. (5)] and\nGalilean invariance [Eq. (9)] is\nL = L(\u03bc, w a, uab ) .\n\n(11)\n\nHere uab was defined in Eq. (6), and \u03bc and w a are\n(\u2202i \u03b8)2\n\u03bc = \u03b8\u0307 \u2212\n,\n2m\n\nw a = \u2212\u1e8a a +\n\n1\n\u2202i \u03b8\u2202i X a .\nm\n\n(12)\n\nThe variable \u03bc appears in the Lagrangian treatment of superfluids [7]: the crystal structure\nis absent there and the Lagrangian is a function of \u03bc alone. Physically, \u03bc is the local chemical\npotential as measured in the frame moving with the superfluid velocity. The meaning of w a\ncan be made clear by expanding it,\nw = u\u0307 + (vs * \u2207)u \u2212 vs .\n\n(13)\n\nAt the linearized level w a is the difference between the velocity of motion of the crystal\nlattice and the superfluid velocity.\nConnection to the AL hydrodynamic theory.-The zero-temperature AL hydrodynamic\nequations can be derived from the Lagrangian (11) as the equations of conservation of particle\n5\n\n\fnumber, energy, and momentum, written using a particular set of variables.

At zero temperature we do not have a normal component distinct from the crystal lattice.

The only difference is the\nlast term on the right hand side of Eq. (21), which is nonlinear in strain and was neglected\n1\n\nNote that T 0i 6= T i0 , since in our nonrelativistic theory energy does not include rest mass. Our normalization of the chemical potential differs from that of AL by a factor of m.\n\n6\n\n\fin Ref. [1]. Moreover, from the definition of \u03bbia , Eq. (16). one can derive the following\nrelation:\n\u03bbik \u2212 \u03bbki \u2212 \u03bbia \u2202k ua + \u03bbka \u2202i ua = (vni \u2212 vsi )pk \u2212 (vnk \u2212 vsk )pi ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhich coincides, up to the two terms nonlinear in strain on the left hand side, to an equation\npostulated in Ref. [1] for T ik to be a symmetric tensor.\nAs one can see, the effective Lagrangian provides an extremely compact encoding of the\nhydrodynamic equations. Terms nonlinear in strain which were omitted in the AL theory\nare fully kept in the Lagrangian. Moreover, for quantum problems (such as scatterings of\nphonons) it is easier to work with the Lagrangian than with the field equations. We now\nshow that the Lagrangian contains a special topological term that is important for scattering\noff defects. For this end, we first discuss the nonsuperfluid limit of the Lagrangian (11).\nThe nonsuperfluid limit-The superfluid fraction \u03c1s /\u03c1 of solid helium-4, if nonzero, is\nmuch smaller than one: experiments [4, 5] indicate a value of order 10\u22122 , while theoretical\narguments [3] suggest \u03c1s /\u03c1 . 10\u22124 . We shall, therefore, concentrate on the limit \u03c1s \u226a \u03c1.\nTo start, let us discuss the limit of vanishing superfluid density.\nOne expects that the nonsuperfluid crystalline state is realized as some particular limit\nof the supersolid state, where \u03b8 decouples from the dynamics of X a fields. This might seem\nnontrivial, since in Eq. (11) the time derivative of X a enters the Lagrangian in the combination w a which involves \u03b8 [Eq. (12)]. However, it is possible to achieve such a decoupling.\nConsider the following Lagrangian:\nL = \u03c10\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u22121 a b \u03bc\ndet u\nu w w +\n2 ab\nm\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 V (uab ) ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is some constant with the dimension of mass density, \u03bc and w are defined in\nEq. (12), and V is an arbitrary function of the strain uab consistent with lattice symmetry.\nUsing the identities (7) and (8), this Lagrangian can be transformed into the form\nL=\n\n\u03c10 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\n\u03c10 \u221a\na b\nab\n\u01eb\n\u01ebabc \u2202\u03bc \u03b8\u2202\u03bd X a \u2202\u03bb X b \u2202\u03c1 X c .\ndet u u\u22121\nab \u1e8a \u1e8a \u2212 V (u ) +\n2\n6m\n\n(24)\n\nThe Greek indices in the last term are spacetime indices which run over t, x, y, z; \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 is the\ncompletely antisymmetric tensor defined so that \u01eb0123 = 1. The phase \u03b8 appears only in the\nlast term of the Lagrangian, which is a full derivative; thus \u03b8 decouples from the dynamics.\n7\n\n\fThe last term, which will be called the \"topological term,\" still plays a useful role: the\nparticle number current computed from (24) by using Noether's theorem arises completely\nfrom this term,\nj\u03bc =\n\n\u03c10 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\n\u01eb\n\u01ebabc \u2202\u03bd X a \u2202\u03bb X b \u2202\u03c1 X c ,\n6m\n\n(25)\n\nfrom which we see that \u03c10 is the total mass density in equilibrium where X a = xa . The\ncurrent (25) is trivially conserved. Note that the first term in Eq. (24) can be written as\nmj i j i /(2j 0), which is what one expects for the kinetic energy from Galilean invariance. This\nfact shows that the construction (23) is unique.\nNow if one allows the superfluid fraction \u03c1s to be nonzero and small, then there are\nadditional terms proportional to \u03c1s added to the Lagrangian, which makes \u03b8 a dynamical\nfield. The topological term continues to be present in the Lagrangian with a coefficient\nwhich differs only slightly from \u03c1/(6m). This term is responsible for low-energy scattering\nof elastic waves by a superfluid vortex, as we shall see.\nScattering of elastic waves by a superfluid vortex.-Let us now use the effective Lagrangian\nto compute the scattering cross section of elastic waves by a superfluid vortex. In the\npresence of a vortex \u03c6 is a multivalued function, and vs \u223c \u2207\u03c6 is singular at the vortex core.\nDue to the multivalued nature of \u03b8, the topological term is no longer integrated by part to\nzero. Integrating by part, this term can be written as\nLtop = \u2212\n\n\u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 abc\n\u01eb\n\u01eb \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c6X a \u2202\u03bb X b \u2202\u03c1 X c .\n6m\n\n(26)\n\nExpanded over small perturbations, this expression contains a term proportional to u * v\u0307s ,\nwhich was identified in Ref. [9] in the context of an Abrikosov vortex in a crystal. For\ndefiniteness, consider a vortex located at x = y = 0 and stretched along the z direction.\nThe field of the vortex has\n\u2202x \u2202y \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202y \u2202x \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y) .\n\n(27)\n\nThe topological term is localized on the vortex core and has the form\nL = \u2212\u03c0\n\n\u03c1\n\u03b4(x)\u03b4(y)(ux u\u0307y \u2212 uy u\u0307x ) + O(u3) .\nm\n\n(28)\n\nNote that the leading term in this Lagrangian contains two powers of u but only one derivative, so it cannot be canceled by an unknown interaction of the vortex core with the elastic\n8\n\n\fz\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5'\n\nk'\n\n\u03b8\n\nk\n\nFIG. 1: The scattering of transverse elastic phonons by a superfluid vortex.\n\nwaves. Moreover, other terms that couple \u03b8 and X a are expected to be proportional to \u03c1s\nand are negligible.\nThe process that will be considered has the following kinematics (Fig. 1). A transverse\nphonon with momentum ~k and linear polarization \u01eb falls perpendicularly onto a vortex.\nWe are interested in the probability of its scattering into the state with momentum ~k\u2032 and\npolarization \u01eb\u2032 . For simplicity, we assume that both \u01eb and \u01eb\u2032 lie in the plane perpendicular\nto the vortex and that the solid is isotropic. The matrix element of the process is\nM=\n\n\u03c0\n(\u01eb \u00d7 \u01eb\u2032 ) * \u1e91 ,\nm\n\n(29)\n\nfrom which we find the differential cross section per unit vortex length,\n\u03c0 ~2\n\u22022\u03c3\n=\nk sin2 \u03b8 ,\n2\n2\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202l\n2 m v\u22a5\n\n(30)\n\nwhere v\u22a5 is the speed of transverse elastic waves. This result is a model-independent prediction of the effective Lagrangian approach, valid at small k and small superfluid fraction.\nQualitatively, the differential cross section has a linear dependence on k and is maximum\nwhen the scattering angle \u03b8 is 90\u25e6 .\nConclusion.-We have found the most general effective Lagrangian describing the lowenergy dynamics of supersolids. We show that, in the limit of small superfluid density, the\nLagrangian contains a topological term which has a fixed coefficient. From this term we\ncomputed the cross section of scattering of transverse phonons off a superfluid vortex. If the\nsupersolid state is realized in 4 He, this prediction is, in principle, verifiable.\nThe formalism used in this paper can be extended to relativistic systems, e.g., for describing the crystalline superfluid phases of quark matter [10]. Instead of Galilean invariance,\none requires relativistic invariance of a theory of four Goldstone bosons \u03b8 and X a . Such a\n9\n\n\ftheory, when coupled to gravity, gives rise to a gravitational analog of the Anderson\u2013Higgs\nmechanism. Indeed, theories of this type have been proposed recently as an infrared modification of gravity that gives the graviton Lorentz-breaking mass terms [11, 12]. From this\npoint of view, the modification of gravity considered in Refs. [11, 12] can be interpreted as\nan effect coming from a supersolid dark matter sector.\nThe author thanks A. Andreev, J.
