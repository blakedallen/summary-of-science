On the other\nhand, new superconductors with a ZrCuSiAs-type structure which consist of elements other than Fe are also\nexplored, for example, La1\u2212x Srx NiAsO5 . Recently, Mizoguchi and his collaborators have discovered the superconductivity in CeNi0.8 Bi2 with a superconducting transition temperature Tc \u223c 4.2 K.6\nSeries compounds CeMBi2 and CeMSb2 have\nZrCuSiAs-type structures with space group of P 4/nmm\ncorresponding to the so-called 1111 system, where M is a\ntransition metal element such as Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ag, and\nso on.7 For CeMBi2 , Bi1, M, Ce and Bi2 sites correspond\nto As, Fe, rare earth element and O sites, respectively.\nThe \"parent\" compound of CeNi0.8 Bi2 , CeNiBi2 is a\nmoderately heavy fermion antiferromagnet ; magnetic\nordering appears at about 5 K and the electronic specific\nheat coefficient \u03b3 is relatively large (470 mJ/K2 mol).8\nThis parent compound does not exhibit a superconductivity although the electric conductivity is metallic down\nto the lowest temperature.8,9\nThe superconductivity is induced by the deficiency of\nNi atom,6 as the superconductivity in the iron-based superconductor of the so-called 1111 system is induced by\noxygen-deficiency.10 The resistivity and superconducting\n\nshielding signal in the magnetic field show the superconducting transition at about 4.2 K. At about 5 K, specific\nheat C exhibits a jump of \u223c4 J/K mol. This jump may\nbe attributed to the magnetic ordering of the Ce 4f moment because the entropy estimated by an integration\nof C/T below 5 K corresponds with Rln2, which is expected from the twofold degenerated ground state of the\nCe 4f electron. The clear jump of the specific heat is\nnot observed at around Tc because the jump caused by\nthe superconducting transition is much smaller than the\njump caused by the magnetic ordering, suggesting that\nthe charge carrier which causes the superconductivity is\nnot coupled with the Ce 4f electron and the mass is not\nenhanced.6\n\nIf the Ce 4f electron is coupled with the superconducting carrier in the present compound, the magnetic fluctuation of 4f electron can induce the unconventional superconducting order parameter. In such a case, temperature dependence of the magnetic Bragg peak should have\nsome anomaly at Tc . Then we have performed powder\nneutron diffraction measurements on CeNi0.8 Bi2 in order\nto investigate the existence of the coupling between the\nCe 4f electron and the superconducting carrier. First,\nwe present the structural parameters determined by Rietveld analysis in Sec. IIIA. The elecrtonic state of this\ncompound discussed in Ref. 6 is based on the present\nresult. In Sec. IIIB, we report the magnetic structure\nand the temperature dependence of the ordered moment\nof the Ce 4f moment. Our results suggest that the Ce\n4f electron does not contribute to the superconductivity\nin this compound, consistent with the suggestion in ref.\n6.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nFor the compound of CeNix Bi2 , we found through a\nseries of synthesis experiments that samples synthesized\nby conventional solid state reaction have a constant Nideficiency of x=0.8.6 A powder sample of CeNi0.8 Bi2 for\nthe present neutron measurements was prepared by following method. Ce, Ni and Bi powders with a nominal\ncomposition of CeNi0.8 Bi2 were used as starting materials. The mixed powder was evacuated in a silica tube\nand heated at 500 \u00b0C for 10 h and 750 \u00b0C 20 h. The obtained powder was ground and pressed into pellets, and\nit was heated 800 \u00b0C for 10 h in the evacuated silica tube.\nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy was used\nto confirm the chemical composition, CeNi0.8 Bi2 , which\nwas consistent with the nominal composition. The sample appears stable thermally in a dry box or an evacuated\nglass tube, but decomposes in an hour when exposed to\nan ambient atmosphere. This decomposition would be\ninduced by the reaction of an unusual valence state of Bi\nions in the material with water vapor in the atmosphere.\nThus, we paid attention so as to avoid decomposition or\ndegradation of the sample. The sample of about 14.3 g\nwas used in neutron diffraction measurements. Electric\nresistivity and superconducting shielding measurements\nconfirm that Tc value and a volume fraction of shielding\nsignal are the same as the values reported in ref. 6.\nThe powder neutron diffraction pattern for the analysis on a crystal structure was collected by using the\nhigh-resolution powder diffractometer (HRPD) installed\nin the reactor JRR-3 of Japan Atomic Energy Agency\n(JAEA). The neutron wavelength was 1.8234 \u00c5 and the\ncollimation was open (effective value of 35')-40'-S-6' (S\ndenotes sample). The pattern was collected at room temperature. The powder sample was set in a vanadium\nholder enclosed in Al cans filled with He gas in order to\navoid the decomposition in the atmosphere. Diffraction\ndata for the analysis on the magnetic structure were collected by using the triple-axes spectrometer TAS-2 in reactor JRR-3 of JAEA. The neutron wavelength used was\n2.3590 \u00c5 and the collimation was 14'-40'-S-40'-80'. The\nsample enclosed in Al can was mounted in a closed-cycle\nrefrigerator.\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nAnalysis of crystal structure\n\nFigure 1 shows the neutron powder diffraction pattern of CeNi0.8 Bi2 obtained from the HRPD. The observed data are shown by crosses. Structural analysis on\nthe neutron powder diffraction pattern is performed by\nusing the program RIETAN2000.11 The space group of\nP 4/nmm is used because we know that the series compounds of CeMBi2 and CeMSb2 have same structure as,\nshown in Sec. I. The diffraction pattern is analyzed including NiBi3 , NiBi and Ni as impurities. Because a\n\nFIG. 1: Observed (crosses) and calculated (solid lines) neutron powder diffraction pattern of CeNi0.8 Bi2 .

The occupation factor of Ni is fixed at 0.8 which is determined\nby ICP spectroscopy. The obtained structural parameters of CeNi0.8 Bi2 are shown in Table I. The errors of\nthe parameters shown in the table are mathematical standard deviations obtained by the analysis. The diffraction\npattern calculated by using refined parameters is shown\nin Fig. 1 by solid lines. The calculated line can reproduce the observed data. Mass fractions of the impurities\nare 9.1 % for NiBi3 , 1.4 % for NiBi and 0.8 % for Ni,\nrespectively. The larger thermal parameter of Ni relative\nto other sites may be due to the impurities.\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nMagnetic structure and T dependence of\nordered Ce moment\n\nResults of 2\u03b8 scan at 11.2 K and 2.9 K, obtained from\nTAS-2 are shown in Fig. 2(a) by gray and black lines,\nrespectively. At 2.9 K a clear Bragg peak appears at\n\nture at low temperatures. For 10l reflections, the clear\nmagentic Bragg peaks are observed at l = 2n and they\nare nearly absent at l = 2n + 1, indicating that the magnetic moments of two Ce atoms in a unit cell at (1/4\n1/4 0.2691) and (3/4 3/4 0.7309) are antiparallel. This\nintesity modulation of magnetic 10l reflections against l\nalso shows that Ni moments are almost independent of\nthe observed magnetic Bragg peaks even if the Ni atoms\nhave magnetic moments. The scattering intensity from\nthe Ni moments should not depend on l because two Ni\natoms are located on a flat layer at z=1/2. In magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements, the contribution of Ni atom\nto the Curie-Weiss-like susceptibility is nearly absent.8,12\nThese results suggest that Ni atom is nonmagnetic. The\nclear peaks are not observed at 00l positions in Fig. 2(b).\nIf the Ce moments are perpendicular to c axis, magnetic\n00l reflections with l = 2n+1 must have large intensities.\nEspecially, the intensity of 001 reflection is expected to be\nabout four times as large as the intensity of 100 reflection. The absence of magnetic 00l reflections indicates\nthat the two Ce moments are oriented along c axis. It\nis consistent with the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility, indicating that the antiferromagnetic easy-axis\nis the c axis.8 Then we can get the magnetic structure\nshown in Fig. 3. In the figure, Ce atom at (1/4 1/4\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Neutron powder diffraction patterns of CeNi0.8 Bi2\nobtained at 11.2 K (gray line) and 2.9 K (black line). The\ndata are collected by using TAS-2.

The intensities of 102 and 111 reflections are\nslightly enhanced at 2.9 K. These results show the existence of magnetic ordering at lower temperatures and\nthe coexistence of magnetic ordering and the superconductivity. Figure 2(b) shows the intensity obtained by\nsubtracting the intensity at 11.2 K from the intensity at\n2.9 K. Clear magnetic Bragg peaks are observed at lower\ntemperatures at the reciprocal lattice points corresponding to 100, 102, 111, and 201. The data are scattered\naround 2\u03b8 \u223c 53 \u00b0 and 63 \u00b0, due to large nuclear Bragg\nintensities of 112/103 and 113/200 reflections whose intensities are about 70000 and 50000 counts at their peak\npositions, respectively. Magnetic 113 reflection does not\nhave clear peak profile due to the large experimental error mentioned above, although it should have almost the\nsame intensity as the magnetic 201 reflection in the magnetic structure presented below.\nFrom these results, we can consider the magnetic struc-\n\nFIG. 3: Crystal and magnetic structure of CeNi0.8 Bi2 .

Here, we use the isotropic magnetic form factor of\nCe3+ .13 The calculated intensities of magnetic Bragg reflections are shown in the right-hand side of the table.\nThe calculated intensities agree with the observed intensities, indicating that present magnetic structure and the\nobtained ordered moment are reasonable. Although 113\nreflection should have the intensity of \u223c200 in the calculation, the observed intensities can not be estimated due\nto the experimental error, as mentioned above.\nThe inset of Fig. 4(a) is the temperature (T ) dependence of the peak profile of 100 reflection. As shown\nin the inset, 100 reflection appears below 5.45 K and\nthe peak gradually develops with decreasing T . Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the T dependences of the integrated intensities of 100 and 102 reflections, respectively. The intensity of 102 reflection has a large error bar\nin this scale because this reflection includes the nuclear\nscattering. The intensities of both reflections increase\nwith decreasing T below about 5 K, consistent with the\ntemperature at which the jump of the specific heat is\nobserved.6 As shown in the main panel of Fig. 4(a), the\ntemperature development of the magnetic Bragg intensity is monotonous down to 2.9 K and an anomaly is not\nobserved at the superconducting transtion temperature,\n4.2 K. It is quite different from the behaviors observed in\nheavy fermion superconductors in which the magnetic ordering and the superconductivity coexist. For example,\nCd-doped CeCoIn5 , CeCo(In1\u2212x Cdx )5 with x=0.1 and\n0.075, exhibit the antiferromagnetic orderings of the Ce\nmoment at Neel temperatures, TN \u223c 3.0 K and 2.5 K,\nrespectively. Superconductivities appear below \u223c 1.2 K\nand 1.7 K, and the antiferromagnetic ordering and the\n\nFIG. 4: Temperature dependences of the integrated intensities of (a) 100 and (b) 102 reflections, respectively. The solid\nline shows the fitting the data below 5 K to the function that\nthe intensity is proportional to 1 \u2212 (T /TN )2 and the extrapolation of the fitting function to zero kelvin. In the inset :\ntemperature dependence of the peak profile of 100 reflection.\n\nsuperconductivity coexist below these temperatures.14 In\nthese compounds, the magnetic Bragg peaks appear below TN and their intensities increase with decreasing T .\nHowever, the developments of the magnetic Bragg intensities are suppressed and they become almost flat to the\ntemperature below Tc .15,16 The present T dependence of\nthe magnetic Bragg intensity suggests that the Ce 4f\nelectron is almost independent of the superconductivity\nand this compound is not a heavy fermion superconductor.\nThe solid line in Fig. 4(a) shows the fitting of data\nbelow 5.0 K to the function that the intensity is proportional to 1 \u2212 (T /TN )2 and the extrapolation of the fitting\nfunction to 0 K. The amplitude of the momtent at 0 K\nobtained by the fitting is 1.71 \u03bcB . In the experimental\naccuracy, any structural change is not observed and the\ntetragonal symmery remains down to 2.9 K. In the tetragonal symmetry, energy levels of the Ce 4f 1 state split\n(1)\n(2)\ninto three doublets, \u03937 , \u03937 , and \u03936 , by the crytalline\nelectric field, where the two former doublets consist of\nlinear combination of Jz = \u00b13/2 and Jz = \u00b15/2 states,\nand the latter consists of Jz = \u00b11/2 state. In the case\nof CeAgSb2 which also has a ZrCuSiAs-type structure,\nthe ground state is the \u03936 state, revealed by the measurement of the crytalline electric-field excitation. The\n\n\f5\namplitude of the antiferromagnetic ordered moment is\nin good agreement with gJ \u03bcB Jz \u223c 0.43 \u03bcB .17 On the\nother hand, the ordered moment in this compound is\nmuch larger than the moment of CeAgSb2 , indicating\nthat the ground state of this compound is not the \u03936\nstate. Such differences of the amplitude of the ordered\nmoment and/or the ground state are caused by the differences of the structural parameters and constituent elements. Actually, other compounds with a ZrCuSiAs-type\nstructure, CeCuBi2 and CeAgBi2 , exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering with easy axes parallel to the c direction.\nTheir saturated ordered moments which are estimated by\nmagnetization curves are 1.76 and 2.1 \u03bcB , respectively.\nThese behaviors are similar to the present compound\nwhile in CeCuBi2 and CeAgBi2 , the superconductivity is\nnot observed and their magnetization curves show metamagnetic behavior which is not observed in the present\ncompound.\nCeNi0.8 Bi2 has the same crystal structure as the socalled 1111 system which has a maximum Tc of about\n55 K among iron-based high-Tc superconductors. Theoretical studies on an iron-based high-Tc superconductor\npoint out that magnetic fluctuation arising from a nesting\nbetween Fermi surfaces at \u0393 and M points in an unfolded\nBrillioun zone is an origin of the superconductivity18\u201321 .\nExperimentally, strong corelations between the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity and the spin fluctuation are observed\nin an iron-based high-Tc superconductor. The inelastic neutron scattering measurements on LaFeAsO1\u2212x Fx\nwith x=0.057, 0.082 and 0.157, show that the spin fluctuation observed in the samples with x=0.057 and 0.082,\nwhose Tc are about 30 K, almost disappears in the sample with x=0.157 in which the high-Tc superconductivity\nis almost suppressed.22 On the other hand, the superconductivity may appear without magnetic fluctuation\nin CeNi0.8 Bi2 , because Ni is nonmagnetic and the Ce\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nY.

The structural parameters at room temperature are determined by the Rietveld method. The clear\nmagnetic Bragg peaks are observed at q=(0 0 0) below\nabout 5 K. In the magnetic ordering phase, the two Ce\nmoments in the unit cell are antiparallel along the c axis\nand the Ni atom does not contribute to the magnetic\nBragg reflections. Below Tc , the superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetic ordering coexist. The magnetic Bragg\nintensity monotonously increases with decreasing T below about 5 K and does not exbihit an apparent anomaly\nat Tc \u223c 4.2 K, suggesting that the 4f electron of the\nCe atom is almost independent of the superconductivity.\nThe saturated ordered moment is about 1.7 \u03bcB .\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank K.

From the Curie constant, the effective moment is\n2.80 \u03bcB , which corresponds to the effective moment of single crystal CeNiBi2 , 2.88 \u03bcB and 2.60 \u03bcB for H k a and\nH k c, reported in ref. 8. These values are larger than 2.54\n\u03bcB of a free Ce3+ ion. However, if the Ni atom has a local\nmoment and also contributes to the Curie-Weiss-type susceptibility, the Curie constant and/or the effective moment\nhave to be much larger than the observed values.\nP.
