INTRODUCTION\n\nProtoplanetary disks are a product of the formation\nof protostars from the collapse of molecular cloud cores.\nThese disks remain a source of ongoing accretion for the\ncentral stellar object for a period of up to \u223c 10 Myr\n(Manning & Sargent, 1997; Wyatt, Dent & Greaves,\n2003) and are the birthplaces of planetary systems. The\nevolution of the disk and of its planetary progeny is controlled by heating and irradiation from the central star-\nfrom IR to X-rays-but in the vicinity of OB stars can\nalso be significantly affected by the external radiation\nenvironment (e.g. Johnstone et al. 1998; Adams et al.,\n2004; Fatuzzo & Adams, 2008) .\nThe discovery of the \"proplyd\" phenomenon and subsequent observations of protoplanetary disks represent an\nimportant and growing part of the legacies of the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes (e.g. O'Dell 1993, Bally\net al. 1998, Evans et al. 2003, Meyer et al. 2004).\nNew instruments such as the Mid-Infrared Instrument\non board James Webb Space Telescope, which will provide both imaging and spectroscopy, hold the promise\nfor higher spatial resolution. On the ground, millimeter\nand submillimeter studies have evolved from examining\ndisk size and orientation (e.g. Keene & Masson 1990,\nLay et al. 1994) to detailed studies of structure, chemistry and thermal properties (e.g. Wilner et al. 2003, Qi\net al. 2006), while future high spatial resolution submillimeter observations with ALMA promise further major\nadvances (e.g. van Dishoeck & J\u00f6rgensen 2008).\n\nThese and other observations should provide insights\ninto issues central to understanding disks and the likelihood of forming planetary systems like our own, such\nas angular momentum transport, and the timescales for\ngrain growth and gas dissipation. Of particular interest\nfor interaction of the disk with its parent star and for the\nstudy of planetary origins are the inner regions of disks\n(\u2264 10 AU) where both terrestrial and giant planets are\nbelieved to form.\nWhile the observational database continues to grow, all\nattempts at theoretically modeling the emission expected\nfrom such environments have lacked several of the ingredients needed for a fully self-consistent approach. The\nmultidimensional, far-Ultra Violet (UV) to X-ray radiative transfer (RT) problem must be solved simultaneously with the disk hydrodynamical evolution, to which\nit is strongly coupled. Furthermore, disks comprise adjacent regions of ionised, photon-dominated and molecular\ngas intermixed with a non-uniform dust component. No\ncomputer code currently available includes all the important physics and chemistry needed to properly interpret\nthe observational diagnostics of these different regimes.\nFurthermore, full theoretical understanding of a number\nof important contributors to the energetics of the system, such as accretion and wind-disk interactions, is still\nlacking; these ingredients can currently only be included\nthrough approximate and phenomenological approaches\n(e.g. see discussion in Glassgold et al., 2004).\nSeveral studies have focused on the properties of the\ndust component of disk atmospheres (e.g. D'Alessio et\n\n\f2\n\nErcolano et al.\n\nal. 2001, Dullemond et al. 2002, Akeson et al 2005).\nHowever, studies of the gaseous component of the inner\ndisks have only recently been attempted, and only an\nexploratory picture of the thermochemical structure of\nthis crucial component has emerged. Pioneering work\nfrom Igea & Glassgold (1999), Glassgold et al., (2004,\n2005) and Meijerink et al. (2008) examined physical\nconditions and expected emission lines in the gaseous\ncomponent of non-evolving T Tauri disks irradiated by\nX-rays. Nomura & Millar (2005) modeled molecular hydrogen emission from protoplanetary disks, taking into\naccount UV radiation from a central star; their models,\nwhile calculating the density and temperature structures\nself-consistently, did not account for X-radiation and employed an approximate treatment of the scattered light\nthat often leads to an overestimation of the UV radiation\nfield in the disk (Glassgold, 2006). Semenov et al. (2004)\nemployed perhaps the most complete chemical network\nto date to calculate the ionisation fractions at the disk\nmidplane. While X-ray ionisation was included, radiative transfer through scattering and diffusion was not.\nSimple column density arguments were used instead to\nestimate the radiation field attenuation at discrete points\nin the disk where the chemical model was applied. Very\nrecently Gorti & Hollenbach presented 1+1D models of\ngas in optically thick disks, calculating thermal, density\nand chemistry structures, with special attention to the\neffects of FUV irradiation.\nMore detailed 2D or 3D calculations are now needed to\nprovide a quantitative picture of these environments in\nrelation to their effects on the disk spectral energy distribution (SED), and on other observables available now\nand in the near future (e.g. [O i], [Ne ii], CO, OH, and\nUV transitions of H2 ; Najita et al, 2007). In particular, observations of forbidden lines in T Tauri stars provide evidence for a tenuous, hot outer layer, or \"corona'\n(Kwan & Tademaru 1988, 1995; Kwan (1997). The earlier work by by Glassgold et al. (2004, 2007), Semenov\net al. (2004) and Meijerink et al. (2008) emphasised the\nchemistry in the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and\nmolecular zones, and stopped short of this coronal layer.\nAlso the recent work by Gorti & Hollenbach does not\ninclude the fully ionized layer discussed here.\nIn this paper, which is the first of a series aimed at\nbuilding a more realistic and self-consistent model of irradiated gaseous T Tauri disks, we employ a fully 3D\nphotoionisation and dust radiative transfer code, mocassin (Ercolano et al., 2003, 2005, 2008), to calculate the detailed ionisation and temperature structure\nof a typical T Tauri disk, with special emphasis on the\nphotoionisation-dominated outer layers and corona. We\nshow that hot coronal temperatures are expected from Xray irradiation from the central pre-main sequence star.\nOur calculations aim to understand the thermochemical\nstructure of the irradiated region and to identify emission\nlines that can be used as gas-phase diagnostics for current and future observations. Furthermore, the detailed\n2D temperature structure calculated by our models allows us to estimate the efficiency of X-radiation to drive\na photoevaporative wind.\nOur model is described in Section 2. The ionisation\nand temperature structures are presented and discussed\nin Section 3, while the predicted emission line spectra\nare shown in Section 4. Section 5 contains a discussion\n\nof our results in the context of disk dispersal via X-ray\nphotoevaporation. A brief summary is given in Section\n6.\n2. THE 2D MONTE CARLO PHOTOIONISATION AND\nDUST RADIATIVE TRANSFER MODEL\n\nPhotoionisation and temperature structure calculations were performed with Version 3.02.00 of the 3D\nMonte Carlo photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code, mocassin (Ercolano et al. 2003, 2005, 2008).\nThe code uses a stochastic approach to the transfer of\nradiation allowing for the self-consistent transfer of both\nthe primary and secondary components of the radiation\nfield. The code was modified to include viscous heating, approximated using the prescription for a thin disk\nby Pringle (1981), and gas cooling by collisions of grains\nwith a mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen (Hollenbach & McKee, 1979); we discuss this further below.\nmocassin was also adapted to run in 2D, using the gas\nand dust density distribution given by a 2D protoplanetary disk calculation of D'Alessio et al. (1999).\nThe D'Alessio model used in our calculation was chosen to be that which best fits the median SED of T Tauri\nstars in Taurus (d'Alessio, 2005). We refer the reader to\nD'Alessio et al. (1999) for a detailed description of the\nmodel ingredients and calculation. In brief, the input parameters for this model include a central star of 0.7 M\u2299 ,\n2.5 R\u2299 irradiating the disk with an effective temperature\nof 4000 K. Additional disk parameters consist of a mass\naccretion rate of 1.e-8 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and a viscosity parameter\n\u03b1 = 0.01. The total mass of the disk is 0.027 M\u2299 .\nThe present study is particularly focused on determining the physical properties of the gas in the outer layers\nand hot disk corona. Molecular species that are expected\nto form deeper in the disk are not included in our model;\nthis poses a limitation on the accuracy of our gas temperature calculations in the inner layers. In particular,\nthe calculations by Glassgold et al., (2004, GNI04) have\nshown that CO rovibrational lines may become important coolants, and, e.g., at a radial distance of 1 AU\nand column densities of 1021 -1022 cm\u22122 CO was found\nto dominate the disk cooling. CO rotational lines are\nalso expected to form at greater depths, though in these\nregions the thermal balance is dominated by dust-gas\ncollisions (GNI04).\nDust-gas collisions can heat the gas/dust if the gas\nis cooler/warmer than the dust; photoelectric emission\nfrom dust grains heats the gas and it provides a minor cooling channel for the dust. mocassin is able to\nself-consistently calculate the dust and gas thermal balance, taking into account the main microphysical processes that couple the two phases. Here, however, we\nchoose to keep the dust temperatures fixed to the values calculated by D'Alessio et al. (1999) and focus our\ndiscussion on the gas phase. In the current work we do\nnot treat the transfer of the stellar or interstellar far-UV\nfield, and therefore the dust temperatures we would obtain from our models would be incorrect. The effects of\ngas-dust interactions on the temperature structure of the\ngas, however, are still taken into account in our gas thermal balance as well as in the radiative transfer, where\nthe competition between dust and gas for the absorption\nof X-ray radiation is properly treated.\nWe illuminate the disk using synthetic X-ray spec-\n\n\fX-ray irradiated protoplanetary disk atmospheres\ntra representative of the high energy emission from a\ntypical T Tauri star. There are currently at least\nthree different mechanisms by which T Tauri stars are\nthought to produce observable X-rays: magnetospheric\naccretion shocks, shocks resulting from polar jets, and\nmagnetically-confined hot coronae analogous to those\nfound on all late-type main-sequence stars including the\nSun (e.g. Kastner et al 2002, G\u00fcdel et al 2005, Walter\n& Kuhi, 1981). The first two of these have only been\nidentified in a small handful of stars, and since the latter appears to dominate the observed X-ray spectra of\nT Tauri stars we currently ignore the effects of X-rays\nfrom jets and accretion.\nCoronal X-ray emission arises from an optically-thin\nplasma dominated by impact excitation and ionization\nby thermal electrons. The spectra from such a plasma\ncomprises significant contributions from bound-bound,\nbound-free and free-free radiation. We computed synthetic coronal spectra incorporating these processes for\nthe energy range 13.6 eV-12.5 keV for all elements with\natomic number Z=1 to 30 using line and continuum emissivities from the CHIANTI compilation of atomic data\n(Landi et al., 2006, and references therein), together with\nion populations from Mazzotta et al. (1998), as implemented in the PINTofALE IDL software suit1 (Kashyap\n& Drake, 2000). We adopted the solar chemical composition of Grevesse & Sauval (1998) for the calculated spectra and an X-ray temperature, log(Tx ) = 7.2. We assume\nan X-ray luminosity, LX (0.1-10 keV)= 2 \u00d7 1030 erg/sec.\nDetails on atomic data and physical processes used for\nthe photoionisation calculations are given by Ercolano\net al. (2003, 2008) and Ercolano & Storey (2006). The\nchemical composition of Grevesse & Sauval (1998) was\nalso used for the gas abundances of the most common\nelements used in our photoionisation model of the disk\ncorona. In view of the ongoing debate on the \"solar oxygen crisis\" (e.g. Ayres et al. 2006; Drake & Testa, 2005;\nSocas-Navarro & Norton, 2007; Socas-Navarro & Centeno, 2008), we have chosen not to use the more recent\ncompilations of solar abundances based on 3-D non-LTE\nhydrodynamic photospheric modeling (e.g. Asplund et\nal. 2005), which recommends 25-35% lower C, N, O and\nNe abundances compared to earlier assessment. We also\nignore the possible effects of grain depletion. Although\nsome depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains\nis expected, the amounts are very uncertain and probably quite small in the disk corona where the X-ray field\nis more intense. Here, undepleted values of C, Mg, Si\nand Fe abundances correspond to efficient destruction\nof grains in the upper layers of the disk. A test for\nthe validity of this assumption could be provided by the\nSi ii 34.8\u03bcm line, which is a good diagnostic for grain depletion, and which our models predict to be observable\n(see Table 1).\nThe dust absorption and scattering coefficients are calculated for high energies using the dielectric constants for\ngraphite and silicates of Laor & Draine (1993), which extend to the X-ray domain. We assume spherical grains\nand use standard Mie scattering series expansion for\nx|m| < 1000, where m is the complex refractive index\nand x = 2 * a/\u03bb is the scattering parameter (see Laor\n1\n\nFreely available from http://hea-www.harvard.edu/PINTofALE\n\n3\n\n& Draine, 1993). For x|m| > 1000 and x|m \u2212 1| < 0.001\nwe use Rayleigh-Gans theory (Bohren & Huffman, 1983),\nand for x|m| > 1000 and x|m \u2212 1| > 0.001 we use the\ntreatment specified by Laor & Draine (1993), which is\nbased on geometric optics.\nOur dust model consists of a typical ISM mixture\nof graphite and silicates with MRN size distribution\n(Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsiek, 1977) described by amin =\n0.005\u03bcm and amax = 0.25\u03bcm. The chosen grain size distribution does not take into account grain growth, and\ntherefore over-emphasizes the cooling of the gas by the\ndust in the disk interior. We also assume a dust to gas\nmass ratio of 0.01 throughout the disk. We note that the\ndensity distribution model of D'Alessio et al. (1999) uses\ndifferent dust prescriptions at different heights, in order\nto account for the effects of grain settling and growth.\nFor the sake of simplicity, and because we assume the\ndust temperatures calculated by D'Alessio et al. (1999),\nwe chose to use a more standard dust model throughout\nour disk. Since matching a particular SED is not one of\nour main objectives, and we are mostly interested in the\nphysical properties of the disk corona, the choice of the\nsize distribution and species is not crucial in our work as\nit will only have a very small effect on the ionisation and\ntemperature structure of the coronal gas.\nAs noted earlier, in addition to all the standard heating\nand cooling channels included in mocassin, we also include viscous accretion heating calculated assuming the\nstandard dissipation rate for a thin disk (Pringle, 1981)\n9\n\u03b1\u03c1c2s \u03a9\n(1)\n4\nwhere \u03c1 is the local mass density of the gas, cs is the\nisothermal sound speed and \u03a9 is the angular rotation\nspeed. The parameter \u03b1 =0.01 relates viscous heating to\nthe gas pressure.\nThe formulation above is purely phenomenological and\ncarries large uncertainties. In particular, the appropriate value of \u03b1 is unclear when the formula is applied to\nthe warm disk atmosphere (GNI04), where it is unknown\nif angular momentum transport such as the magnetorotational instability (MRI; Balbus & Hawley, 1991) even\noperates at all. GNI04 show the effect that varying the\nvalue of \u03b1 has on the temperature structure of the gas,\nbut finally adopt a model with \u03b1 = 0.01 for their line\nemission predictions (Glassgold et al. 2007; Meijerink et\nal. 2008). A value of \u03b1 = 0.01 is also chosen by d'Alessio\net al. (1998, 1999, 2001) for their disk structure calculations (which includes the model used in this paper).\nThis choice is is based on the connection between \u03b1 and\nthe disk accretion rate: M \u0307D \u221d \u03b1\u03a3D , where \u03a3D is the\nintegrated surface density of the disk. With \u03b1 = 0.01,\nwhich is also the value implemented in our models, X-ray\nheating is dominant in the disk corona, while accretion\nheating dominates in the inner regions.\nWe finally note that the dependence of the heating\nrate on the square of the sound speed implies a linear\ndependence on the gas temperature, which poses potential problems for the hot disk corona. In the regions\nwhere the gas is heated to high temperatures by X-ray\nirradiation the functional form of accretion heating, as\nformulated above, fails completely, preventing an equilibrium temperature from being found. In fact, X-ray\nirradiation in the upper atmosphere of the inner regions\n\u0393acc =\n\n\f4\n\nErcolano et al.\n\nof the disk heats the gas to temperatures above the local\nescape temperature of the gas (see section 5). The gas in\nthese regions is to be considered unbound and part of a\nphotoevaporative flow, hence not subject to the standard\nviscous accretion law. For unbound gas we remove the\naccretion heating contribution altogether by setting the\nlocal \u03b1 coefficient to zero in our models.\n3. THE IONISATION AND TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE\n\nIn this section, we present the temperature and ionisation structure of the gas in the inner disk, focusing our\nattention on the disk corona. We limit our discussion to\nradial distances R . 40 AU, beyond which, in our model,\nsets a rough outer limit to the region where the effects\nof X-ray irradiation on the temperature and ionisation\nstructure are more evident. We note, however, that in\nour models a low levels of ionisation is maintained out to\na radius of \u223c190 AU.\nFigure 1 shows the temperature structure (asterisks)\nin the vertical column calculated at R = 0.07 AU, together with the the dust temperature profile calculated\nby D'Alessio et al. (1999). Also shown is the volumetric\ngas density [cm\u22123 ] as a function of depth, the corresponding geometrical height above the midplane is shown in the\ntop x-axis. The gaseous disk corona at these very small\nradii is fully ionised. Since all elements are stripped of\ntheir outer electrons, cooling by collisionally excited lines\nis inefficient. The balance between heating by photoionisation and cooling by line emission and recombination\nprocesses corresponds to a gas equilibrium temperature\nof \u223c106 K.\nAt 0.07 AU, the jump in gas temperature occurs at a\nvertical column density of \u223c 5\u00d71014 cm\u22122 , where the gas\ndensity is \u223c 3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 and the ionisation parameter,\ndefined as \u03be = L/nR2 , is log(\u03be) \u223c1.78. This transition\nwould look even sharper in a hydrostatically balanced\nmodel, since a rise in the temperature would induce a\ndrop in density in order to mantain pressure equilibrium.\nIn this case, any equilibria found in the 104 -106 K range\nmay in fact be unstable (Hatchett, 1976). This has already been noticed in accretion disk models around Xray binaries (e.g. Raymond 1993). Alexander, Clarke &\nPringle (2004, ACP04) have also presented a model to\nillustrate the effects of X-ray heating on the structure of\ncircumstellar disks. In that work, the density profile was\ntruncated at the point where the density fell to 104 cm\u22123 ,\nwhich is below the fully ionised region shown in our Figure 1. This should be kept in mind when comparing our\ntemperature structure to theirs (as shown in their Figure 3), where the lack of the \u223c106 K temperature (fully\nionised) region is not surprising and is not discrepant\nwith our results.\nThe electron density distribution, shown in Figure 2,\nindicates that the a high level of ionisation at 0.07 AU\nis maintained for a column density of 1017 cm\u22122 , after\nwhich it decays to lower values. A study of the thermal\nbalance at this radius indicates X-ray heating dominates\nfor a column depth of \u223c1022 cm\u22122 , while heating by viscous accretion dominates further down in the disk where\nit is balanced by dust-gas collisional cooling. In our calculations, the contribution from accretion heating is set\nto zero in regions where X-ray irradiation heats up the\ngas to temperatures above the local escape temperature\n(see section 2). At R = 0.07 AU this occurs at a column\n\ndepth of \u223c1014.5 cm\u22122 , at the onset of the temperature\n'discontinuity'.\nFigure 3 shows the temperature and volumetric density [cm\u22123 ] structures in the vertical column calculated\nat R = 1 AU, together with the D'Alessio et al. (1999)\ndust temperature profile. The coronal gas here appears\nto be only partially ionised and the electron density, illustrated in Figure 4, reaches a level of just over 10%\nof the hydrogen density, but decreases very rapidly with\ncolumn depth.\nOur temperature structure at 1 AU is comparable to\nthat found by GNI04, allowing for differences in the\nmodel input parameters, and bearing in mind that their\ncalculation started at a column depth of 1018 cm\u22122 .\nHowever, the cooling and heating contributions calculated by the two models disagree somewhat and deserve\nfurther explanation. The various heating and cooling\nchannels in our model at 1 AU are illustrated as a function of vertical column depth in Figure 5, which can\nbe compared with an analogous illustration in Figure 3\nof GNI04. One conspicuous difference between the two\nmodels is the accretion heating contribution, which is\nsimply due to the different choice of \u03b1 (0.01 in this work\nand 1.0 in the particular model plotted in Figure 3 of\nGNI04). Note that GNI04, also investigated models with\nlower values of \u03b1 (see their Figure 2), and indeed used\na model with \u03b1 = 0.01, for their later work (Glassgold\net al., 2007; Meijerink et al.; 2008), where emission line\npredictions are given. Unfortunately a plot showing the\nheating/cooling contributions from their models is only\navailable for the \u03b1 = 1 case. Another important difference lies in the Ly\u03b1 cooling contribution, which is only\nof secondary importance in our models but dominates\nthe cooling down to a vertical column of 1021 cm\u22122 in\nthe GNI04 model. The dominant cooling mechanism in\nthe upper disk atmosphere in our model is metal line\nemission. The Ly\u03b1 cooling in GNI04 was overestimated\nbecause of an assumption of a thermal equilibrium population for the n =2 level. The \"Ly\u03b1\" channel in the\nGNI04 model also includes cooling by the fine structure\nlines of O i, while other atomic coolants are ignored. In\nspite of the aforementioned differences, the total cooling\ncalculated by GNI04 is very similar to that obtained in\nthis work for the regions where the calculations overlap\nand when the same \u03b1 parameter is employed (Glassgold,\n2008; private communication).\nAs we move to increasingly larger radii, up to approximately 25-30 AU, our model disk structure remains qualitatively similar to that at 1 AU: high gas temperatures\nare reached in the corona, followed by a steep temperature decrease, with the gas and dust becoming thermally\ncoupled at a vertical column depth of \u223c5\u00d71021cm\u22122 .\nBeyond \u223c35-40 AU, due to geometrical dilution of the\ncentral radiation field, the effects of X-ray irradiation\nbecome less evident, however a low level of ionisation\nis maintained out to a radius of \u223c190 AU. For T-Tauri\nstars born in clusters containing massive stars, like the\nOrion Nebula Cluster, the dominant irradiation mechanism at large disk radii is probably provided by the interstellar or intracluster FUV and X-ray fields, which are\nnot included in our current models. This is not true for\nstars born in smaller clusters like \u03c1 Ophiuchi and TaurusAuriga, where indeed large disks (\u223c500-1000 AU) are\nfound (Andrews & Williams, 2007).\n\n\fX-ray irradiated protoplanetary disk atmospheres\nThe maximum temperature reached by the disk corona\nat a given radial distance is an immediate consequence of\nthe local ionisation parameter. The fact that at 1 AU we\ndo not see the \u223c106 K gas layer is simply due to the fact\nthat the density distribution of d'Alessio et al. (1999)\nused in our models is truncated at a volumetric density\nof \u223c104 . At 0.07 AU, the temperature jump to \u223c106 K\noccurs at a log(\u03be) = 1.78. The same value at 1 AU implies\na density of \u223c150 cm\u22123 , which is below the cut-off.\nThe general results found in our models are similar to\nthose found by Gorti & Hollenbach (2008), in particular\nthat the gas and dust are thermally de-coupled down to\na column of \u223c 1022 cm\u22122 .\n4. PREDICTED EMISSION LINE SPECTRUM\n\nAs an aid to future observational campaigns, we have\ncalculated the emission line spectrum predicted by our\nmodel. Line luminosities are integrated out to a radius of 190 AU. In Tables 1 and 2 we list a subset\nof the strongest collisionally excited metal line and hydrogen recombination lines, respectively, down to a luminosity of \u223c10\u22128 L\u2299 , which corresponds to a flux of\n\u223c1.8\u00d710\u221217erg/s/cm2 at a distance of 140pc. The flux\nat a distance D, assuming a face-on orientation for the\ndisk, is obtained by dividing the luminosities listed by\nthe appropriate dilution factor (4\u03c0D2 ). He i recombination lines are found to be rather weak, with the\nexception of He i 10.8\u03bcm which has a luminosity of\n8.8\u00d710\u22127L\u2299 , He i 7067\u00c5 with luminosity of 3.2\u00d710\u22128L\u2299\nand He i 3890\u00c5, He i 5877\u00c5, He i 6688\u00c5 and He i 20.5\u03bc,\nall with luminosities of \u223c2\u00d710\u22127L\u2299 . The full set of lines,\nincluding over 2000 transitions is available on request\nfrom BE. The line list will be further improved and updated in a future work, when the effects of simultaneous\nstellar and interstellar FUV irradiation, as well as X-rays,\nwill be considered. Some changes to the emission line intensities are also expected when the X-irradiation will\nbe studied in the context of a self-consistent hydrostatic\nequilibrium calculation.\nTables 1 and 2 provide an indication of the lines that\nshould be targeted for observations of the gaseous phase\nof disk atmospheres. A number of potential atomic and\nionised gas diagnostic lines should already be detectable\nwith current instrumentation. The [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm line,\nin particular, has already been detected in T Tauri disks\n \u0307\nwith Spitzer by Pascucci et al. (2007), Lahuis et al(2007)\nand Espaillat et al. (2007), and with MICHELLE on\nGemini North by Herczeg et al. (2007). The detections\nto date range from a few 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 L\u2299 , in qualitative agreement with values predicted by our model.\nThe [Ne iii] 15.5\u03bcm line has so far only been detected\nin Sz102 (Lahuis et al. 2007), implying a [Ne iii]/[Ne ii]\nof \u223c0.06 for this object, which is some 2.5 times larger\nthan our model. As noted by Glassgold et al. (2007)\nthe abundance of Ne2+ is lowered by charge exchange\nreactions with neutral H, implying low (\u22640.1) ratios of\n[Ne iii]/[Ne ii] in the X-ray heated gas. Gorti & Hollenbach (2008) also discuss the effects of EUV irradiation\nwhich would enhance the predicted [Ne ii] and [Ne iii]\nline luminosities, and affect their ratio. They predict\nthat the [Ne iii]/[Ne ii] also depends on the details of\nthe EUV spectrum, with hard EUV spectra naturally\nproducing the higher ratios.\n\n5\n\nTable 1 clearly shows that a number of optical\nlines have fluxes that are significantly larger than the\n[Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm fluxes. Unfortunately many optical and\nUV lines are not observable with current technology, as\nthey are invisible against the stellar spectrum. In particular, we predict a luminosity of 3.3\u00d710\u22125 for the Mg i\nline at 4573\u00c5, for undepleted Mg abundances. This corresponds to only a few % of the continuum flux level for\na photosphere of 4000K and for an assumed resolving\npower of 50,000. While this line might be detectable under favourable circumstances and where disk gas is not\nstrongly depleted, we are unaware of any such detections\nin the literature.\nThe predicted absolute flux of the various lines depends, of course, on the details of the disk structure, the\ngas abundances and the ionising spectrum. As an example, Meijerink et al. (2008, MGN08), show, for a fixed\ndisk structure, the dependence of the predicted flux of a\nnumber of fine structure and forbidden lines on the assumed X-ray luminosity. Furthermore, lines with very\nlow critical densities like the C i and C ii fine structure\nlines (see Table 3) are also very sensitive to conditions in\nthe outer regions of the disk, where densities are small.\nThese regions are preferentially illuminated by the interstellar (or intracluster) radiation fields which are not\nincluded in our current simulations.\nUnfortunately, Table 1 is not yet complete, as reliable\ncollision strengths were not available for all species, and\na number of less abundant elements were omitted from\nour calculations in order to limit computational costs. In\nparticular, the following species were not included, due\nto lack of atomic data: Ne i, Mg iii, Si i, S i, Fe i, Fe iv,\nFe ix, Fe xi, Fe xiii. Due to its complexity, the Fe ii ion\nwas also omitted from the present calculations but will\nbe included in future models.\nA further observational complication lies in the difficulty in separating the emission from the disk, the wind,\nthe accretion funnels and the photosphere. High resolution spectroscopy offers one possibility, in which line\nprofiles that are shifted and/or broadened to different\nextents in the different emission regimes can be resolved\n(e.g. Herczeg et al., 2007). Following the suggestion in\nMGN08, in future work we will present predicted profiles for a number of potentially observable lines emitted\nfrom different regions of the disk. An alternative way to\ndistinguish lines formed in the upper layers of the disk\nand those formed in the accretion funnel would involve a\ncomparison of transitions with different critical densities\n(e.g. O i 6302 with Ncrit = 1.5\u00d7106cm\u22123 , compared to\nO i 63\u03bcm with Ncrit = 2\u00d7104cm\u22123 ).\nWe note that some of our predicted line intensities differ somewhat from those calculated by MGN08. In most\ncases, the differences may be explained by the fact that\nour work used a different disk model for the underlying\ngas density distribution, and different gas abundances.\nBy way of comparison, we have also computed a model\nthat uses the same input parameters and disk model as\nthose of MGN08 and we compare the predicted line fluxes\nto those of MGN08 in Table 3. Most of the lines listed\nare in reasonable agreement, particularly when one considers the two different approaches to the problem and\nthe use of different atomic data. MGN08 predict larger\n[Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm line luminosities than in our model; this is\n\n\f6\n\nErcolano et al.\n\nexplained by the fact that MGN08 do not include cooling\nby [Ne ii] line, which, as already noted by Gorti & Hollenbach (2008) is found to be important. As a consequence\nthe gas temperature in the [Ne ii] emitting region will\nbe higher in MGN08's calculations, producing a larger\n[Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm luminosity. The C ii fine-structure line at\n158\u03bcm shows a larger discrepancy and deserves further\nattention. Because the critical density of this line is low\n(see Table 3), it will be collisionally quenched at even\nmodest depths into the disk, and will be preferentially\nemitted in the less dense upper layers of the disk corona.\nMGN08 calculations, however, were focused on the characterisation of lower layers in the disk and stopped short\nof the corona, with the result that some of the flux from\nthe C ii bright regions is probably missed.\nA detailed comparison of the line luminosities predicted by Gorti & Hollenbach (2008) to those predicted\nby our models is hindered by the different parameters\nand approaches employed by the two models. However\nwe note that the [Ne ii] 12.8\u03bcm luminosity predicted by\nour models is a factor or 3.3 lower than that derived by\ntheir fiducial model (Model A, their Table 4). This can\nbe explained by the fact that our density distribution is\ndetermined by the dust temperature structure. Indeed\nGorti & Hollenbach (2008) comment that when they assume a dust-determined temperature structure they obtain a factor of \u223c4 lower [Ne ii] line luminosities. We\nalso note that our predicted C i and C ii fine-structure\nlines are higher by a factor of \u223c2 than those given by\nmodel A in Gorti & Hollenbach (2008). As discussed\nabove, these lines have low critical densities and are\ntherefore extremely sensitive to the details of the density\ndistribution in the emitting region, furthermore, we use\na factor of \u223c3 higher elemental abundance for C. These\ntwo factors are probably responsible for the small discrepancy at hand. Gorti & Hollenbach (2008) use highly\ndepleted values for the Si elemental abundance; this is\nthe likely cause of the lower (factor of \u223c10) Si ii 35\u03bcm\nline luminosities predicted by their models. Finally the\nfactor of \u223c3 lower O abundance used in their model is\nprobably one of the causes of the small (factor of \u223c1.5)\ndiscrepancy with the O i 63\u03bcm line luminosity.\n5. DISK DISPERSAL BY PHOTOEVAPORATION\n\nCircumstellar disks are observed around the majority\nof young stars at \u223c106 yr (e.g. Lada & Lada 2003). By\nages of \u223c107 yr, however, only low-mass debris disks are\ngenerally observed (e.g. Manning & Sargent, 1997; Wyatt, Dent & Greaves, 2003), implying disk lifetimes of up\nto a few \u223c106 yr. Indeed, recent observations indicate\nthat about 90% of low mass stars lose their primordial\ndisks at 5-7 Myr (e.g. Haisch et al., 2001; Hartmann,\n2005; Hernand\u00e9z et al., 2007a). However, very few observations exist of objects in transition between classical\nT Tauri stars, which still have disks of a few percent\nof a solar mass, and weak-lined T Tauri stars, which\nhave dispersed nearly all of their circumstellar disks. For\nexample, Hernandez et al. (2007b) reported only a 10%\nfrequency of transitional disk candidates among the diskbearing low mass stars in their Spitzer observations of the\nOrion OB1 association. This suggests that the mechanism responsible for the final stages of disk dispersal\nmust operate on relatively short timescales-perhaps as\nshort as \u223c105 yr (e.g. Duvert et al., 2000, Andrews &\n\nWilliams, 2005).\nPhotoevaporative heating from both the central star\nand external sources has been posited as a viable mechanism able to satisfy the two-timescale nature of the problem. A dramatic illustration of the latter is the apparent\nphotoevaporation of Orion \"proplyds\" in the vicinity of\nOB stars (e.g. Johnstone et al. 1998, Adams et al.,\n2004; Fatuzzo & Adams, 2008). Evidence is also accumulating that disk loss is more rapid in more O-star rich\nclusters, as judged from observed disk frequencies in lowmass stars (e.g. Albacete-Colombo et al. 2007, Guarcello\net al. 2007, Mayne et al. 2007). We will return to photoevaporation by external sources of radiation in future\nwork, and concentrate here on the effect on the disk of\nirradiation by the central T Tauri star.\nPhotoevaporation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from\nthe central star has been investigated by a number of\nauthors (see Alexander, 2007; Dullemond et al, 2007;\nHollenbach, Yorke & Johnstone, 2000, for recent reviews). The original models did not couple photoevaporation with viscous evolution, resulting in disk dispersal\ntimescales exceeding the observational estimates. Subsequently, the 'UV switch' model of Clarke et al. (2001),\nwhich coupled photoevaporative mass loss to viscous\nevolution, was able to reproduce the two-timescale behaviour implied by the observations. However a number\nof problems still remain, as pointed out in Clarke et al.\n(2001). In particular, current models require that the\nLyman continuum emission from the central star does\nnot derive from accretion, an issue that is currently unclear (ACP04). X-ray ionisation and heating of the disk\ncorona provide an attractive alternative engine to drive\nphotoevaporative flows. The fact that weak-line T Tauri\nstars, for which accretion has nearly ceased, are known\nto be brighter in the X-ray than classical T-Tauri stars,\nwhich are still accreting, suggests that the production of\nX-ray is not linked to accretion. ACP04 estimated an\nupper limit to the mass-loss driven by X-rays and found\nit to be at best only comparable to that derived for ultraviolet evaporation. They concluded, therefore, that\nX-ray heating is unlikely to be the dominant disk dispersal mechanism. ACP04 took into account the effects\nof X-ray photoionisation and heating on the hydrostatic\nstructure of a typical T Tauri circumstellar disk, but were\nlimited by the fact that the radiative transfer problem\ncould not be solved self-consistently in 2D.\nWhile our models do not yet iterate over the disk density structure, which would be undoubtedly modified by\nX-ray irradiation, we do calculate the irradiated thermal\nstructure in 2D. It is therefore worthwhile to provide an\nestimate of the mass-loss rates and dispersal timescales\nimplied by our models. We estimate mass-loss rates by\nlocating, at each radial distance, the base of the photoevaporative flow, defined as the height where the local gas\ntemperature exceeds the escape temperature of the gas,\ndefined as Tes = GmH M\u2217 /kR, where M\u2217 is the stellar\nmass, R is the radial distance. This height is illustrated\nas a function of radial distance in Figure 6. The figure\nshows that, between 8 and 40 AU, the height of the photoevaporating envelope follows a nearly linear increase\nwith radial distance from the star (slope \u223c0.9). To a\nfirst approximation, the mass loss rate per unit area can\nbe estimated as \u03a3\u0307x = \u03c1cs , where \u03c1 and cs are, respec-\n\n\fX-ray irradiated protoplanetary disk atmospheres\ntively, the gas density and the sound speed evaluated at\nthe base of the flow.\nFigure 7 (left panel) shows \u03a3\u0307X , the mass loss rate per\nunit area and (right panel) the mass loss rate from an\ninfinitely thin annulus as a function of radial distance\nin the disk. \u03a3\u0307X peaks at approximately 12 AU, near\nthe gravitational radius, rg for gas with sound speed of\n\u223c 7km/s (T \u223c 6000 K). We use the definition of rg\ngiven by Hollenbach et al. (1994), where rg = GM\u2217 /cs .\nThe value at the peak is 3.1\u00d710\u221212 g s\u22121 cm\u22122 , this\nis about a factor of ten higher than the estimate of\nACP04 (2.6\u00d710\u221213 g s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) and the value obtained\nby Hollenbach et al. (1994) for UV photoevaporation\n(3.9\u00d710\u221213 g s\u22121 cm\u22122 ). We note that both studies considered the case of a 1 M\u2299 star; however, since photoevaporation rates scale only weakly with mass (\u223c M 0.5\nfor EUV photoevaporation and almost linearly for X-ray\nphotoevaporation), this is not sufficient to explain the order of magnitude difference with our rates. As discussed\nin the next section, our model has a number of limitations which may result in uncertainties in the derived\nphotoevaporation rates. Taking into account statistical\nuncertainties in the calculated temperatures alone, we\nfind that our models are also consistent with peak values as low as \u223c8\u00d710\u221213g s\u22121 cm\u22122 , only a factor of \u223c\n4 higher than previous estimates when corrected for the\ndifferent stellar masses.\nThe effects of X-ray photoevaporation are only significant between 8 and 40 AU. There is also a small inner\nregion between 0.03 and 0.16 AU, where, in spite of the\nlarge escape temperatures, the intense X-ray field causes\nthe disk to lose mass at a rate of 3-4\u00d710\u221213 g s\u22121 cm\u22122 .\nGiven the small area at small radii, this does not contribute significantly to the mass loss. The reason for the\nmass loss being mainly concentrated between 8-40 AU\nis that this region lies far enough from the central star\nfor the escape temperatures to become sufficiently low\nand not so far that the effects of X-ray irradiation become unimportant. In other words, the steep drop in\n\u03a3\u0307X inside 8 AU corresponds to the location where the\nsound speed at \u223c104 K drops below the Keplerian speed.\nAny mass loss at smaller radii comes from coronal gas.\nIn fact, for radial distances smaller than 8 AU, there is\nalso a thin layer of gas in the disk corona where X-ray\nirradiation causes temperatures to rise above the local\nescape temperatures. However, the contribution of this\nregion to the total mass loss budget is negligible. We\nalso note here that by analogy with the X-ray heated\naccretion disk models of Begelman, McKee and Shields\n(1983) the wind region might extend inward to about\none tenth of the radius where the sound speed equals the\nescape speed. In that case the wind in Figure 7 would\nbegin at about 0.8 AU and the total mass loss rate would\nbe increased. More recent works by Liffman (2003) and\nFont et al. (2004) also find that an EUV-driven wind\nis launched from well inside the gravitational radius (as\ndefined by Hollenbach et al., 1994).\nThe dispersal timescale implied by our model is of a\nfew Myr, for a 0.027 M\u2299 disk, and the total mass loss\nrate is of the order of \u1e40X \u223c 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The disk\nhowever, as well as being photoevaporated, is also accreting. Therefore, we can assume that the effects of\nX-ray photoevaporation would not be felt until its vis-\n\n7\n\ncous accretion rate, \u1e40acc , has fallen below \u1e40X , at which\npoint the disk would empty rapidly within 10-20 AU.\nUnderstanding the later evolution of the disk, after the\nregion within 10-20 AU has been emptied, requires us to\ndetermine whether the disk beyond \u223c20 AU (i) has to\naccrete in to the 10-20 AU region and then be photoevaporated or (ii) is more or less fixed in density profile and\nthen overtaken by the outward propagating ring of mass\nloss. Behaviour of type i (or ii) results if the mass loss\nrate increases (decreases) as the hole size increases. This\nquestion will be answered in a following study where we\nplan to solve for the density structure and the 2D X-ray\ntransport self-consistently.\nOur current calculations give \u1e40X \u223c 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , implying that disks with \u1e40acc \u2264 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 should disperse rapidly and therefore be seldom observed. However\nthis is in disagreement with observations of a considerable number of systems in the 0.5-1 M\u2299 range that are reported to have accretion rates lower than 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nIndeed accretion rates as low as 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 are seen\nin the \u22120.2 < log M\u2217 < 0 mass bin in Figure 8 of Gregory et al. (2006), which, collecting data from a number\nof authors, shows the correlation between observed mass\naccretion rates and stellar mass. This indicates that our\npredicted \u1e40X \u223c 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is probably too high, and\nmay point to a weakness of our model (see discussion in\nthe next Section).\n5.1. Limitations of our models\n\nA number of important approximations were used in\nour models, which may lead to uncertainties in the estimates of the photoevaporation rates.\nOne major caveat of our model, already mentioned in\nthis paper, is that the influence of X-ray photoionisation and heating on the disk density structure has been\nignored. The high gas temperatures reached in the inner regions of the disk would cause an expansion of the\ngas in the z-direction, as shown, for example, by ACP04.\nIndeed, their lower value of mass loss rate is perhaps\ncaused by a larger attenuation of the X-ray field due to\nthe 'puffed up' inner disk material that is not accounted\nfor by our models. A hot and inflated inner disk could\nin fact cause a shadowing effect of the regions at larger\nradial distances, reducing the effects of X-ray photoevaporation there. The magnitude of this effect can only\nbe properly estimated via the simultaneous solution of\nthe 2D radiative transfer problem and the 1D hydrostatic equilibrium in the z-direction, which is the aim\nof a follow-up paper.\nFurther uncertainties are introduced by the use of the\n\"\u03c1 \u00d7 cs \" approximation in the calculation of photoevaporation rates. In Section 5 we discuss how the base of the\nphotoevaporative envelope is defined as the height where\nthe local gas temperature exceeds the escape temperature of the gas. While this is generally a very good approximation in cases where the temperature and density\nvary sharply at the ionisation front, as for EUV photoevaporation (e.g. Hollenbach et al., 1994), in the case\nof X-ray photoevaporation presented here, the distinction between the bound and unbound gas is less clear.\nIn other words, a small error in the determination of\ntemperatures in our models, would lead to much larger\nuncertainties in the density, and hence in the estimated\n\n\f8\n\nErcolano et al.\n\nphotoevaporation rates.\nWe conclude that while we have shown that X-rays\nhave the potential to drive an outflow, our derived rates\nshould be treated with caution and we defer firm conclusions to future work.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe have presented a 2D photoionisation and dust radiative transfer calculation of a typical T Tauri protoplanetary disk irradiated by 1.5\u00d7107 K (kT = 1.36 keV)\nX-ray radiation field from the central pre-main sequence\nstar.\nA detailed characterisation of the temperature structure of the upper disk corona was provided, which uncovered the existence of a layer of highly ionised, hot gas\nin the inner disk regions. The maximum temperatures\nreached by the gas in the upper corona were mapped\nacross the radial dimension of the disk, showing peaks\nexceeding 106 K in the very inner regions. The hotter\ncomponent of the gas in the inner disk and at radii between \u223c8 to \u223c40 AU was shown to be unbound, and\nprobably part of a photoevaporative flow.\nTo aid future efforts to observe the hot/warm gas component of T Tauri disks, we provide a substantial list\nof predicted emission line luminosities, many of which\nshould already be detectable with current instrumentation.\nThe temperature structure of the irradiated disk im-\n\nplies a total mass loss rate of \u223c 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and a\ndisk dispersal timescale of a few Myr for a disk mass of\n0.027 M\u2299 , which is the mass of the disk structure model\nwe employed. We discuss the limitations of our model\nand highlight the need for further calculations that solve\nthe 2D radiative transfer problem simultaneously with\nthe 1D hydrostatic equilibrium of disk structure in the\npolar direction.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe extend our warmest thanks to Al Glassgold, for\ninsightful discussion and a thorough assessment of our\nresults.
