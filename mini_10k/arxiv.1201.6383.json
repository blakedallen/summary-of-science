Gamma-ray burst: general \u2013 Galaxies: high-redshift \u2013 Galaxies: fundamental parameters\n\n1. Introduction\nSearching for high-redshift galaxies is a very active field in observational cosmology. Observing the most distant galaxies is\nimportant for improving our understanding of the formation and\nevolution of these objects, and the reionization of the Universe\n(for a review, see Robertson et al. 2010)\nGalaxies at redshifts above seven and up to about eight are\nnow regularly detected from space and ground based wide-field\nphotometry, either with narrow band filters for Ly-\u03b1 emitters or\nbroad band filters for Lyman break galaxies (Ouchi et al. 2009;\nMcLure et al. 2010; Bouwens et al. 2010; Castellano et al. 2010;\nTilvi et al. 2010; Vanzella et al. 2011; Cl\u00e9ment et al. 2011).\nSpectroscopic confirmation of a handful of these objects has now\nbeen reported (Iye et al. 2006; Stark et al. 2010; Lehnert et al.\n2010; Fontana et al. 2010; Vanzella et al. 2011; Pentericci et al.\n2011; Schenker et al. 2012; Ono et al. 2012). These observations\nare of considerable interest because they allow us to constrain\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the Paranal\nObservatory under programs 60.A-9402(A), 085.A-0418(A), and\n085.A-0418(B).\n\nthe reionization history of the Universe, and to understand the\nnature of the sources responsible for this reionization.\nLong gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer an alternative method\nand an attractive shortcut in this difficult quest to detect the first\ngalaxies (for a review, see Gehrels et al. 2009). Thanks to their\ntremendous X-ray and gamma-ray prompt emission, GRBs can\nbe detected out to very high-redshifts (higher than eight), e.g.\nfrom the Swift and Fermi satellites. In addition, the absorption\nfeatures of the intergalactic medium (IGM) on the otherwise featureless power-law spectra of the GRB afterglows provide spectroscopic tools for the redshift determination and investigation\nof the IGM properties (Kawai et al. 2006; Greiner et al. 2009).\nHowever, we need to understand how the GRB host galaxy\npopulation is representative of the whole galaxy population, in\ngeneral. There are already some indications of the global properties of the GRB host galaxy population at low redshift, z . 2,\nwhich appear to be generally low luminosity (Le Floc'h et al.\n2003), low metallicity (Vreeswijk et al. 2001; Gorosabel et al.\n2005; Starling et al. 2005; Wiersema et al. 2007), and starforming galaxies (Christensen et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2009).\nTheir morphologies are very diverse: irregulars, spheroids, spi1\n\n\fS. Basa and al.: Constraining the nature of the most distant GRB host galaxies\n\n2. Observations and detection limits\n2.1. Sample selection\n\nWe selected the most distant spectroscopically confirmed GRBs\n(z > 5) observable from the VLT site, which resulted in a sample of five objects. Two of them were excluded from our sample:\nthe host of GRB 050904 at z = 6.3, for which deep Hubble\nSpace Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope observations exist (Berger et al. 2007), and the host of GRB 090423, which\nis the most distant of all spectroscopically confirmed GRBs\n(Salvaterra et al. 2009; Tanvir et al. 2009). We decided that the\nlatter object would have been too faint and difficult to observe,\ndecision that was probably wise in the face of our results.\nThe final sample finally targeted the host galaxies of GRB\n080913 at z = 6.7 (Greiner et al. 2009), GRB 060927 at z = 5.5\n(Ruiz-Velasco et al. 2007), and GRB 060522 at z = 5.1 (Cenko\net al. 2006). These three GRBs have properties that are typical of\nthe long GRB population with an isotropic energy release Eiso \u2248\n7 \u2212 8 \u00d7 1052 erg. All of these redshifts were determined from the\nspectroscopic observation of the GRB afterglow emission.\nOur final sample consists of three out of the five spectroscopically confirmed GRBs at z > 5 known to date.\n\n100\n\n30.8\n\nAB magnitude (arbitrary normalization)\n\n120\n\nRest-frame wavelength (nm)\n160\n180\n200\n\n140\n\nLy\u03b1\n\n30.6\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\nGalaxy metallicity\n\nzGunn\n\nZ=0.001\n\n30.4\n\nZ=0.020\n\n30.2\n\nRedshift = 5.1\n\n30\n29.8\n29.6\n29.4\n29.2\n29\n28.8\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n1300\n\n1400\n\n1500\n\n1600\n\nObserver wavelength (nm)\n\n30.8\n\n80\n\n100\n\nRest-frame wavelength (nm)\n120\n140\n160\n\n180\n\nLy\u03b1\n\n30.6\n\nAB magnitude (arbitrary normalization)\n\nrals, and mergers (Conselice et al. 2005; Wainwright et al. 2007).\nThe investigation of the stellar populations of these hosts, using multi-band photometry, suggests that GRB hosts at z . 2\nare small star-forming galaxies with likely sub-solar metallicity\n(Savaglio et al. 2009).\nOnly a partial glimpse has been obtained of the GRB host\ngalaxy population, at somewhat moderate redshifts, z . 2, and\nvery little about the properties of GRB host galaxies at higher\nredshift is known. More observations are therefore required to\nenhance our understanding of both their properties and the implications of using GRBs as probes of the high-redshift universe.\nTo achieve this aim, we performed very deep photometric\nobservations of three high-redshift GRB host galaxies and deep\nspectroscopic observations of one of them. Our targets are the\nhosts of GRB 080913 at z = 6.7 (Greiner et al. 2009), GRB\n060927 at z = 5.5 (Ruiz-Velasco et al. 2007), and GRB 060522\nat z = 5.1 (Cenko et al. 2006). We used FORS2 and HAWK-I at\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT) to observe in the near infrared\nthe rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum of these galaxies and\nderive, or constrain, their star formation rates (SFRs). On one\nobject, GRB 080913, the most distant in our sample, we performed deep spectroscopic observations with X-Shooter at the\nVLT to search for Ly-\u03b1 emission.\nOur observations and data analysis are discussed in Sect. 2.\nWe then discuss in Sect. 3 the constraints derived from our observations on the GRB host galaxy properties at high redshift,\nz > 5.\nThroughout this paper, we assume a flat \u039bCDM model with\nH0 =70 km.s\u22121 and \u03a9 M =0.3 (Komatsu et al. 2011).

Example of galaxy spectral energy distribution with two different\nmetallicities from Schaerer & Pell\u00f3 (2002), and with the FORS2 and\nHAWK-I bands superimposed (magnitudes are arbitrary normalized).\nTo illustrate the band selection, the spectra have been redshifted to 5.1,\nas for GRB 050622 (top), and 6.7, as for GRB 080913 (bottom).\n\nWe accordingly observed GRB 060927 in the zGunn band\nwith FORS2, and GRB 060927 and GRB 080913 in the Y band\nwith HAWK-I. The central wavelengths were \u03bb0 = 910 nm for\nthe zGunn filter and \u03bb0 = 1021 nm for the Y band filter. The targets were centered on the detectors providing the optimal performance for their respective instruments, in practice chip#1 (master CCD) for FORS2 and quadrant#3 for HAWK-I. Only the data\nfrom these detectors were subsequently reduced and analyzed.\nThe observations were carried out in service mode between\nJuly and October 2010. Total exposure times and observing conditions for each target are reported in table 1.\n2.2.2. Data reduction\n\n2.2.1. Observations\n\nThe data were reduced using IRAF1 and AstrOmatic2 routines,\nallowing us to control the reduction process step by step.\nOne of the most delicate data-reduction steps in the nearinfrared domain is sky subtraction. We adopted the prescription\ndescribed in details in Cl\u00e9ment et al. (2011), which allows us\nto estimate the sky at any particular pixel by building a running\nsky frame for each science frame. A relative astrometric solution is computed for each sky-subtracted frame using Scamp and\na fourth-order polynomial fit of bright star positions across the\ndetector plane. All the resulting images are then resampled to a\ncommon reference frame using a LANCZOS4 interpolation kernel and finally stacked with Swarp (Bertin et al. 2002).\n\nThe photometric bands were chosen to sample the rest-frame UV\ncontinuum of the targets at \u223c1500 \u00c5, which is longward of the\nLy-\u03b1 forest, but blue enough to minimize any spectral contamination from old stellar populations (figure 1).

At a redshift\nof z \u223c 5, this corresponds to a distance of \u223c 12 kpc, which, even\nif large, does not allow us to definitively reject these objects as\nthe possible host galaxies of the GRBs. We analyzed archival\nFORS2 imaging data of these two fields in the R band3 . The\nsame objects are also detected in this band, which excludes that\nthey are at a redshift higher than \u223c 4 and therefore that they\nare the host galaxies of the GRBs. Therefore, none of the three\nGRB hosts is detected down to the limiting magnitudes of our\nobservations.\nWe performed simulations to estimate the limiting magnitudes reached by our observations. Fake point sources with different magnitudes were added to the stacked images. SExtractor\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996) was then used to recover the fake\nsources, allowing us in turn to estimate the completeness of our\nobservations. The magnitude limits given throughout this paper\nare the point-source 80% completeness limits.\nMoreover, in combining the final images for each of the\nthree fields, we tested the impact of the different stacking methods (mean, median, and sigma-clipping) on the detection limits\nreached by our observations. The limits were identical to within\n\u223c 0.1 magnitude, an error that we conservatively added to the\nphotometric errors measured by SExtractor.\nBefore converting the measured fluxes to luminosities, we\ninvestigate the possible effects of dust, both locally in the Galaxy\nand in the GRB hosts. The Galactic extinction in the direction of\nthe three fields is on the order of < 0.1 magnitude (Schlegel et al.\n1998). As to the dust in the GRB hosts, we assume that the extinction, inferred from the difference between the observed and\nexpected GRB afterglow spectral indices, is representative of the\noverall extinction in the galaxy. No evidence of dust attenuation was found in the afterglow observation of GRB 060927 and\nGRB 080913 (Greiner et al. 2009; Ruiz-Velasco et al. 2007).\nShort of any estimate of the extinction for GRB 060522, we assume that there is no extinction in this object.\nThe final detection limits of our three host galaxies are reported in table 2 and figure 3 together with the magnitudes of\nknown GRB hosts at lower redshifts. To illustrate the depth\nreached by our data, the limiting magnitude on GRB 080913\nhost data is for instance \u223c 1.5 magnitude deeper than previously\npublished observations of this object.\n\nGRB 080913\n\n2.2.3.

The\nthree-slice IFU has a total field of view of 4\"\u00d71.8\" and the centering was done on the GRB position, allowing between a 1\u2032\u2032\nand 2\u2032\u2032 uncertainty in the GRB and the host galaxy positions.\nThe IFU field of view was re-imaged at the entrance of the spectrograph as three 0.6 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032 sub-slits.\nObservations were carried out in service mode in September\nand October 2009. Twenty exposures of 570 s each were taken\nunder excellent observing conditions (mean seeing \u2248 0.8\u2032\u2032 and\nclear to photometric nights) for a total integration time of 3.2 h.\n2.3.2. Data reduction\n\nThe first steps of the processing of the IFU VIS arm observations\nwas performed using the X-Shooter data reduction pipeline version 1.2.2 (Goldoni et al. 2006), namely sky subtraction, distortion correction, and flux calibration. The 20 two-dimensional images were then stacked using standard IRAF routines. Standard\nstar observations were used to complete the spectrophotometric\ncalibration. The reconstruction of the datacube was carried out\nfollowing the procedure described in Flores et al. (2011).\nThe final spectrum covers the wavelength range [550-1020]\nnm, with a spectral resolution of R\u223c13200.\n3\n\n\fS.

Various filtering methods such as weighted Gaussians or\nwavelets were tested but did not allow us to detect the presence\nof an emission line in any of the three IFU slices.\nThe continuum is not detected as expected from the photometric and spectroscopic detection limits reached by our data:\nMY > 27.6 (table 2) corresponds to . 9\u00d710\u221221 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121\nat 1021 nm, while the spectroscopic detection limit of our XShooter data is \u223c 0.8\u00d710\u221218 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 .\nTo estimate the limit imposed by our null detection of a Ly-\u03b1\nemission line, we performed simulations of emission lines based\non the properties of z\u22486.6 Ly-\u03b1 emitters (LAEs), at a redshift\nvery similar to the redshift of GRB 080913. The average full\nwidth at half maximum (FWHM) of the Ly-\u03b1 line in the LAE\nsample of Kashikawa et al. (2011) is 12.4 \u00b1 5.0 \u00c5.

Discussion\n3.1. Constraints on the properties of the GRB host galaxies\nat z > 5\n\nFrom the UV luminosity limits at \u223c1500 \u00c5, we derived upper\nlimits to the SFRs of the GRB hosts in our sample, using the\nKennicutt (1998), Moustakas et al. (2006), and Savaglio et al.\n(2009) conversion relations. These various relations give results\n4\nWe fitted each simulated emission line with a Gaussian function\nto test whether a line was present, then by a straight line (test of the\nabsence of a line). The detection limit is defined as the flux for which\n80% of the simulations have \u03c72 /nd f (Gaussian) = \u03c72 /nd f (line).\n\n4\n\nMagnitude limit\n(AB mag)\n> 27.6\n> 27.0\n> 26.1\n\nGalactic extinction\n(AB mag)\n0.05\n0.07\n0.07\n\nthat are consistent to within a factor of about two. The resulting\nSFR values, reported in table 3, do not exceed a few M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nSimilarly, the null detection in the spectroscopic observation of the GRB 080913 host did also allow us to derive a\nconstraint on the SFR of this object. At z = 6.7, the line flux\nlimit corresponds to a Ly-\u03b1 luminosity limit L(Ly-\u03b1) . 0.5\u00d71042\nerg s\u22121 . Using the empirical relation from Totani et al. (2006),\nS FR(Ly-\u03b1) = 9.1 \u00d7 10\u221243 L(Ly-\u03b1) M\u2299 yr\u22121 , this corresponds to\nan extinction-uncorrected SFR of . 0.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , in good agreement with the < 0.9 M\u2299 yr\u22121 upper limit derived from the photometric data (table 3). Since the Ly-\u03b1 line is usually strongly\nattenuated, even at high redshift, the photometric limit is probably more reliable than the spectroscopic one, and this is therefore\nthe limit that we adopt.\nFor the sake of this discussion, we used of published results\non another high-redshift GRB host, GRB 050904, at z = 6.3.\nThis host could not be detected in deep HST and Spitzer observations (Berger et al. 2007). Significant dust attenuation, A1400\u00c5 \u2248\n1.2 magnitude, was first inferred from the GRB afterglow observations of Berger et al. (2007), which agrees with the one\ndeduced from the afterglow absorption spectrum (Kawai et al.\n2006). However, a reanalysis of the GRB 050904 afterglow observations questions the evidence of dust in this host. Zafar et al.\n(2011) found a lack of even moderate attenuation, while Stratta\net al. (2011) again found some evidence of dust attenuation. In\nthe absence of a clear consensus, the most conservative limits\ngiven by the assumption of significant dust attenuation (Berger\net al. 2007) are considered in this paper (table 3). These do not\naffect our - essentially qualitative - conclusions.\nThe final sample used in this paper consists of four out of the\nfive spectroscopically confirmed GRBs at z > 5. Albeit based on\nlow numbers, we assume that this sample is nonetheless representative of the GRB host population at high redshift, allowing\nus to discuss the properties of these objects.

These SFR limits\nare also shown in figure 5 together with the SFR values of lower\nredshift GRB hosts. They are among the strongest constraints\never reported for high-redshift GRB host galaxies (Tanvir et al.\n2012).\nWith the SFR-mass relations given by Savaglio et al. (2009)\nand Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2011), we infer an upper limit to the mass of\nthe GRB hosts of \u223c 109.2 M\u2299 for a SFR lower than \u223c 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n.\n3.2. Comparison with low redshift GRB host galaxies\n\ntion is relatively low5 , \u223c6 %. This suggests that the GRB host\ngalaxies have a lower SFR at redshifts > 5 than they have at redshifts . 1. This is not a surprise in itself as it is now well-known\nthat the SFR decreases with redshift in the general galaxy population.\n3.3. Comparison with high-redshift galaxies\n\nWe now turn to our comparison of the properties of the GRB host\ngalaxies at z > 5 with the properties of the normal galaxy population at the same redshifts. To do this, we assumed that GRBs\ntrace star formation in galaxies at z > 5 in an unbiased way,\nas at lower redshifts (Jakobsson et al. 2005). Selecting galaxies based on the past occurrence of a GRB therefore introduces\na bias towards the high luminosity ones, in proportion to their\nUV luminosities. Adopting the Jakobsson et al. (2005) formulation, the luminosity function of GRB host galaxies is proportional to \u03a6(z, MUV ) \u00d7 10\u22120.4\u00d7MUV , where MUV is the UV absolute\nmagnitude and \u03a6(z, MUV ) the luminosity function of the normal\ngalaxy population.

UV luminosity function of the high-redshift galaxies from\nBouwens et al. (2011) (top) and the probability, P(z, < MUV ), that a\nGRB host galaxy at redshift z is brighter than MUV (bottom). For example, the probability that a GRB host galaxy at z = 5.5 is brighter than\nMUV = \u221219.6, as for the GRB 060927 host (table 3), is \u223c19 %.\n\nBouwens et al. (2011), on the grounds that galaxies of such faint\nluminosities are probably suppressed due to the combined effects of UV background, SNe feedback, and inefficient gas cooling (Read et al. 2006; Dijkstra et al. 2004). For the LF itself, we\nuse the LF from Bouwens et al. (2011) defined at a rest-frame\nwavelength of 1600 \u00c5 and redshifts of about five, six, and seven.\nWe note that despite the high-redshift LFs being relatively wellcharacterized, the remaining uncertainties, in particular in the\nfaint-end slope, introduce errors in the results that do not however affect our conclusions.\nWith these assumptions, we computed P(z, < MUV ). Our results are shown in figure 6, from which we were able to derive\nthe probability that four observations give no detections. It is\nrelatively high, 66%6 , meaning that our null detections are consistent with the properties of the general galaxy population. We\nwere unable to infer from our results whether the GRB host\ngalaxies in our sample either differ from or are representative\nof the general galaxy population at similar redshifts.\nClearly, detecting galaxies at z > 5, and therefore GRB host\ngalaxies, is a challenge that requires extremely deep observations. For instance, if the population of GRB host galaxies is\nrepresentative of the population of normal galaxies, the probability of detecting a host galaxy counterpart to a GRB at z \u223c 5.5\nand brighter than MUV \u2248 \u221217.5 is 50%. This corresponds to a\ndetection limit of about two magnitudes deeper than the limits\nreported in this work.\nQ\nThe probability that four observations give no detection is (1.0 \u2212\nP(z, < MUV )) = (1.0 \u2212 0.19) \u00d7 (1.0 \u2212 0.08) \u00d7 (1.0 \u2212 0.06) \u00d7 (1.0 \u2212 0.05) \u2248\n0.66.\n6\n\nRedshift\n\n080913\n971214\n000926\n011211\n021004\n030226\n030323\n030429\n050904\n090205\n\n6.69\n3.42\n2.04\n2.14\n2.33\n1.99\n3.37\n2.66\n6.29\n4.65\n\nLy-\u03b1 luminosity\n(1042 erg s\u22121 )\n< 0.5\n70.0 \u00b1 7.9\n5.8 \u00b1 0.4\n1.0 \u00b1 0.3\n11.1 \u00b1 2.6\n< 72.3\n1.3 \u00b1 0.1\n15.3 \u00b1 7.9\n< 0.8\n4.3\n\nReference\nThis work\nKulkarni et al.

This can\nbe compared to the luminosity of the Ly-\u03b1 line in other highredshift objects. The GRB 090205 host galaxy at z = 4.6, observed by D'Avanzo et al. (2010), has for example a Ly-\u03b1 luminosity equal to 4.3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 . This value is in the range of\nthe Ly-\u03b1 luminosities (1 \u2212 15 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ) observed in lower\nredshift (1.9 < z < 3.4) GRB hosts exhibiting Ly-\u03b1 emission\n(table 4).

(2011)).\nTo compare the Ly-\u03b1 luminosity limit of GRB 080913 to\nthe general distribution of Ly-\u03b1 luminosities in high-redshift\nobjects, we considered the LAE population at z \u2248 6.6 from\nKashikawa et al. (2011). The distribution of Ly-\u03b1 luminosities in\nthis population is represented in figure 7. Taking this distribution\nas representative of the LAE population at the GRB 080913 redshift, we derived a probability7 of not detecting the host galaxy\nof GRB 080913, if it was a Ly-\u03b1 emitter, of \u223c 4%.\nWe infer from this simple analysis that the host galaxy of\nGRB 080913 is probably not a Ly-\u03b1 emitter. This is consistent\nwith the observations from Jakobsson et al. (2011), indicating\nthat the fraction of Ly-\u03b1 emitters among GRB host galaxies at\nredshifts 1.8 < z < 4.5 is only \u223c 37%.\n\n4. Summary\nWe have performed deep near-infrared photometric observations\ntargeting the rest-frame UV continuum (\u223c1500 \u00c5) in three GRB\nhost galaxies at redshifts > 5. In addition, for one of these objects (the host of GRB 080913), we have performed deep spectroscopic observations targeting the Ly-\u03b1 line. Making use of results available in the literature for a fourth object, we have compiled a sample of four distant GRB host galaxies, from the five\nmost distant GRBs at z > 5 for which spectroscopic redshifts are\navailable.\nNone of the GRB host galaxies are detected down to the sensitivity limit of our observations. From the UV rest-frame luminosity limits derived from these null detections, we have inferred\n7\n\nWe fitted the distribution of Ly-\u03b1 luminosities at z \u2248 6.6 from\nKashikawa et al. (2011) with a normal distribution and computed the\nprobability of having a luminosity fainter than 0.5 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 .\n\n\fS.

Distribution of Ly-\u03b1 luminosities in z = 6.6 LAEs (Kashikawa\net al. 2011) (red line). The Ly-\u03b1 luminosities of the GRB hosts listed\nin table 4 are represented by the filled gray rectangles. Our limit to the\nLy-\u03b1 luminosity of the GRB 080913 host is indicated by the vertical\ndashed line.\n\nthat the four objects in the sample have SFRs that are statistically\nlower than at z . 1. Assuming that our sample is representative\nof the population of GRB host galaxies at z & 5, we therefore\nconclude that GRB host galaxies at z . 1 and at z & 5 have\nstatistically different SFRs. Conversely, these null detections are\nstatistically compatible with the properties of the general galaxy\npopulation at z & 5. Deeper observations would be required to\ninvestigate whether the two populations have different properties.\nWe did not detect Ly-\u03b1 emission in the host of GRB 080913\nat z = 6.7, and from the detection limit reached by our observations we infer that this object is probably not a Ly-\u03b1 emitter.\nThese results indicate that the observations of GRB host\ngalaxies at z > 5 is a challenging endeavor, and systematic observations of this population of galaxies will need to await the next\ngeneration of large telescopes (JWST, ELTs). Meanwhile, realtime photometric and spectroscopic observations of GRB afterglows will remain a powerful tool to characterize the farthest\ncollapsed objects in the Universe and probe their environments.\nAcknowledgements.
