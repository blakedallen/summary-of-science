We prove the existence of a hyperbolic surface spread over the\nsphere for which the projection map has all its singular values on the extended\nreal line, and such that the preimage of the extended real line under the projection map is homeomorphic to the square grid in the plane. This answers a\nquestion raised by \u00c8. B. Vinberg.\n\n1. Introduction\nAccording to the uniformization theorem, an open simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to either the complex plane C, or the open unit disc\nD = {z \u2208 C : |z| < 1}. In the former case it is said to be parabolic, and in the latter\nit is called hyperbolic. We are interested in the application of the uniformization\ntheorem to clasically defined surfaces spread over the sphere.\nA surface spread over the sphere is a pair (X, \u03c8), where X is a topological surface\nand \u03c8 : X \u2192 C a continuous, open and discrete map. Here C denotes the Riemann\nsphere. The map \u03c8 is called a projection. Two such surfaces (X1 , \u03c81 ), (X2 , \u03c82 ) are\nequivalent , if there exists a homeomorphism \u03c6 : X1 \u2192 X2 , such that \u03c81 = \u03c82 \u25e6 \u03c6.\nAccording to a theorem of Sto\u0131\u0308low [4], there exists a unique conformal structure on\nX such that \u03c8 is a holomorphic map. We call this the pull-back structure on X.\nIf X is open and simply connected, then as a Riemann surface with the pull-back\nstructure it is conformally equivalent to either C or D. Equivalent surfaces have\nthe same conformal type.\nA continuous, open and discrete map \u03c8 near each point z0 is homeomorphically\nequivalent to a map z 7\u2192 z k . The number k = k(z0 ) is called the local degree of\n\u03c8 at z0 . If k 6= 1, z0 is called a critical point and \u03c8(z0 ) a critical value. The set\nof critical points is a discrete subset of X. A point a \u2208 C is called an asymptotic\nvalue of \u03c8, if there exists a curve \u03b3 : [0, t0 ) \u2192 X such that\n\u03b3(t) \u2192 \u221e and \u03c8(\u03b3(t)) \u2192 a as t \u2192 t0 .\nA point a \u2208 C is called a singular value of \u03c8 if a is either a critical or an asymptotic\nvalue of \u03c8.\n\u00c8. B. Vinberg [5] introduced the interesting class V of surfaces spread over the\nsphere (X, \u03c8), such that all singular values of \u03c8 are contained in R = R \u222a {\u221e}.\nFor such mappings \u03c8, the components of the preimages of the upper and lower\nhemispheres are called cells. The preimage of the extended real line is a disjoint\nThe first author was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.

Each vertex\nhas an even number (which is greater than or equal to four) of edges emanating from\nit. The map \u03c8 in this case is called a cellular map. The set \u03c8 \u22121 (R), understood\nas an embedded graph N in X, determines the topological properties of \u03c8. Such\nan embedded graph N is called a net. Suppose that the edges of this graph are\nlabeled by positive numbers such that the sum over the edges of each cell is 2\u03c0. If\nC is endowed with the spherical metric, we assume that \u03c8 maps an edge labeled by\n\u03b1 onto an arc of length \u03b1. Since the length of the real line in the spherical metric\nis 2\u03c0, this is possible. Equivalently, one can label the vertices of a net and ends of\nedges going to infinity by points of C, so that the order of labels correspond to the\nnatural order on R.\nIt is an interesting question in which cases the conformal type of X is determined\nby the combinatorics of a net, independent of the labeling. G. MacLane [2] and\nVinberg [5] considered the periodic net cos\u22121 (R). They showed that all labelings\nof this net by real numbers and \u221e, with ends of edges going to infinity labeled by\n\u221e, produce parabolic surfaces.\nIn his paper, Vinberg asked whether the conformal type is determined by combinatorics in the case of the square grid net. It is clear that if the labels on the vertices\nof every two adjacent square cells are symmetric with respect to their common edge,\nthe resulting surface is parabolic, and the corresponding cellular map is a fractional\nlinear transformation of some Weierstrass elliptic function. The main result of this\npaper is the following theorem, which answers the question of Vinberg.\nTheorem 1. There exists a hyperbolic surface of class V whose net is homeomorphic to the square grid.\nFrom the point of view of the type problem, the class V is a generalization of a\nclassically studied class S. A surface spread over the sphere (X, \u03c8) is said to belong\n\u0001\nto the class F (a1 , . . . , aq ), if \u03c8 restricted to the complement of \u03c8 \u22121 {a1 , . . . , aq } is a\n[\nF (a1 , . . . , aq )\ncovering map onto its image C\\{a1 , . . . , aq }. One defines Fq :=\na1 ,...,aq\n\nand S :=\n\nS\n\nq Fq .\n\nSurfaces of class S have a combinatorial representation in terms of so-called labeled\nSpeiser graphs. Assume that (X, \u03c8) \u2208 Fq and X is open. We fix a Jordan curve L,\nvisiting the points a1 , . . . , aq in cyclic order. The curve L is usually called a base\ncurve. It decomposes the sphere into two simply connected regions H1 , the region\nto the left of L, and H2 , the region to the right of L. Let Li , i = 1, 2, . . . , q, be the\narc of L from ai to ai+1 (with indices taken modulo q). Let us fix points p1 in H1\nand p2 in H2 , and choose q Jordan arcs \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3q in C, such that each arc \u03b3i has\np1 and p2 as its endpoints, and has a unique point of intersection with L, which\nis in Li . We take these arcs to be interiorwise disjoint, that is, \u03b3i \u2229 \u03b3j = {p1 , p2 }\nwhen i 6= j. Let \u0393\u2032 denote the graph embedded in C, whose vertices are p1 , p2 , and\nwhose edges are \u03b3i , i = 1, . . . , q, and let \u0393 = \u03c8 \u22121 (\u0393\u2032 ). We identify \u0393 with its image\nin R2 under an orientation preserving homeomorphism of X onto R2 . The graph \u0393\nhas the following properties: It is infinite, connected, homogeneous of degree q, and\nbipartite. A graph, properly embedded in the plane and having these properties is\ncalled a Speiser graph, also known as a line complex . The vertices of a Speiser graph\n\n\fA HYPERBOLIC SURFACE WITH A SQUARE GRID NET\n\n3\n\n\u0393 are traditionally marked by \u00d7 and \u25e6, such that each edge of \u0393 connects a vertex\nmarked \u00d7 with a vertex marked \u25e6. Each face of \u0393, i.e. a connected component of\nR2 \\ \u0393, has either a finite even number of edges along its boundary, in which case\nit is called an algebraic elementary region, or infinitely many edges, in which case\nit is called a logarithmic elementary region. Two Speiser graphs \u03931 , \u03932 are said\nto be equivalent , if there is a sense-preserving homeomorphism of the plane, which\ntakes \u03931 to \u03932 .\nThe above construction is reversible. Suppose that the faces of a Speiser graph\n\u0393 are labeled by a1 , . . . , aq , so that when going counterclockwise around a vertex\n\u00d7, the indices are encountered in their cyclic order, and around \u25e6 in the reversed\ncyclic order. We fix a simple closed curve L \u2282 C passing through a1 , . . . , aq . Let\nH1 , H2 , L1 , . . . , Lq be as before. Let \u0393\u2217 be the planar dual of \u0393. If e is an edge of \u0393\u2217\nfrom a face of \u0393 marked aj to a face of \u0393 marked aj+1 , let \u03c8 map e homemorphically\nonto the corresponding arc Lj of L. This defines \u03c8 on the edges and vertices of\n\u0393\u2217 . We then extend \u03c8 to map the faces of \u0393\u2217 homeomorphically to H1 and H2 ,\nrespectively. This defines a surface spread over the sphere (R2 , \u03c8) \u2208 F (a1 , . . . , aq ).\nThe conformal structure is induced by the conformal structure of C if one considers\na copy of H1 or H2 for each face of \u0393\u2217 , and glues H1 to H2 using the identity map\nwhenever the corresponding faces are adjacent. See [3] for further details.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is in two parts. In Section 2 we construct a hyperbolic\nsurface of class S whose net is a certain degeneration of the square grid, namely some\nof the sides of the grid are collapsed to a point. In Section 3 we use quasiconformal\ndeformations to obtain a surface of class V with the desired net. For a background\non the theory of quasiconformal maps see [1].\nWe would like to mention two interesting open questions connected to this result.\nFirst, is it possible to find a hyperbolic surface spread over the sphere with combinatorics of the square grid, which has a labeling that is symmetric with respect\nto a line? This would correspond to a real meromorphic map in the unit disc such\nthat the preimage of the extended real line is homeomorphic to the square grid.\nThe second question is whether MacLane-Vinberg's result still holds if one allows\nnon-symmetric labeling of the cosine net, i.e. whether the cosine net always gives a\nparabolic surface in the case when we do not assume that labels on the ends of edges\ngoing to infinity in the upper half-plane are the same as in the lower half-plane.\nAcknowledgments.

A hyperbolic surface of class S\nConsider a planar graph G whose vertices form the set {(m, n) : m, n \u2208 Z}, and\nwhose edge set is\n{[(m, n), (m, n + 1)] : m, n \u2208 Z} \u222a {[(m, n), (m + 1, n)] : m, n \u2208 Z, n \u2265 0}\n\u222a {[(m, n), (m + 1, n)] : m, n \u2208 Z, n < 0, m < 0}.\n\n\f4\n\nLUKAS GEYER AND SERGEI MERENKOV\n0\n1/e\n\n0\ne\n\n0\n1/e\n\ne\n\n1/e\n\n0\ne\n\n1/e\n\n0\ne\n\n0\n1/e\n\n1/e\n\n0\n\n1/e\n0\n\ne\n\n1/e\n0\n\n0\n\nFigure 1. Speiser graph \u0393 and the corresponding net.\nWe denote by \u25e6 every vertex (m, n) with |m + n| even, and by \u00d7 every vertex (m, n)\nwith |m + n| odd. By replacing edges of the set\n{[(m, \u22122n), (m, \u22122n + 1)] : m, n \u2208 Z, m \u2265 0, n \u2265 1}\nin the graph G by multiple edges of the same form, we obtain a homogeneous graph\nof degree four. This is a Speiser graph which we denote by \u0393 (see Figure 1). We label\nits faces by 0, 1/e, e, \u221e, so that this order is preserved when going counterclockwise\naround \u00d7, and the face adjacent to the vertex (0, 0) which is in the first quadrant\nis labeled by e.\nThe Speiser graph \u0393 with so prescribed labeling defines a unique surface (X, \u03c8) of\nclass S, or, more precisely, of class F4 (0, 1/e, e, \u221e). Here we assume that the base\ncurve is the extended real line. The rest of this section is devoted to the proof that\nthe surface (X, \u03c8) is of hyperbolic type.\nWe will show hyperbolicity by first cutting the surface into two parts A and B, and\nfinding explicit quasiconformal maps to horizontal strips. We then calculate the\nasymptotics of the gluing maps and use a Theorem of L. I. Volkovyski\u0131\u0306 [6] to show\nhyperbolicity of the resulting surface.\nLet B be the subsurface of X with boundary which is obtained by gluing together\nhemispheres corresponding to the vertices of the Speiser graph \u0393 from the set\n{(m, n) : m > 0, n \u2264 0}, together with quarterspheres from the set {(0, n) : n \u2264 0}.\nQuarterspheres here are the parts of the hemispheres outside the unit disc. Let A\nbe the complement of B in X. Then the interiors of A and B are simply connected\nand the common boundary is a simple curve (see Figure 1).\nThe part A is uniformized by the strip S1 = {z : 0 < Im z < \u03c0}, using the map\n\u2118(\u03b1(exp(z))),\nwhere \u03b1 is the quasiconformal map given in polar coordinates by (r, \u03b8) 7\u2192 (r, 3\u03b8/2),\n0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, and \u2118 is the conformal map of a rectangle {x+iy : 0 < x < \u03c0/2, 0 < y <\n\u03c4 } to the domain {|z| > 1, Im z > 0}, with \u2118(0) = 1, \u2118(\u03c0/2) = e, \u2118(\u03c0/2 + i\u03c4 ) = \u221e\nand \u2118(i\u03c4 ) = \u22121.

By [6, Theorem 24, p. 89] (see also the remark following\nit), the resulting surface is hyperbolic.\n3. Unraveling logarithmic staircases\nIn this section we will use quasiconformal deformations of (X, \u03c8) to obtain a surface\nof the same type with the net homeomorphic to the square grid.\nA simply connected subsurface (Y, \u03c8) with Y \u2282 X is a logarithmic staircase over\na \u2208 R in (X, \u03c8) if there exists c \u2208 R such that \u03c8|Y : Y \u2192 De\u2217c (a) is a regular\ncovering map, i.e. there exists a conformal map \u03c6 : Y \u2192 {Re z < c} such that\n\u03c8(z) = a + e\u03c6(z) for z \u2208 Y . The preimage of the real line consists of infinitely many\nhalf-lines lk = (\u2212\u221e, c) + i\u03c0k, k \u2208 Z, in the \u03c6-coordinate. A simply connected\nsubsurface (Y, \u03c8) is a logarithmic staircase over \u221e if (Y, 1/\u03c8) is a logarithmic\nstaircase over 0. The surface (X, \u03c8) contains infinitely many logarithmic staircases\nover 0 and \u221e.\n\n\f6\n\nLUKAS GEYER AND SERGEI MERENKOV\n\nFigure 3. Topological picture of the net of the cos-spine.\nIn order to obtain a surface whose net is homeomorphic to the square grid, we\nwill replace all of those logarithmic staircases by cosine spines. We say that (Y, \u03c8)\nis a cos-spine in (X, \u03c8) if Y \u2282 X is simply connected, \u03c8 is a cellular map, and\n(\u03c8|Y )\u22121 (R) is a union of infinitely many lines l0 , l1 ,. . . , where l0 has one endpoint\non \u2202Y , all other lines have two endpoints on \u2202Y and l0 intersects every lk once, and\nnone of the other lk intersect (see Figure 3). The line l0 is the axis of symmetry of\nthe cos-spine.\nTheorem 2. Let (X, \u03c8) be a Riemann surface spread over the sphere and (Y, \u03c8)\na logarithmic staircase over some a \u2208 R in (X, \u03c8). Let z0 be a point on \u2202Y with\n\u03c8(z0 ) \u2208 R. Endow X with the pull-back complex structure. Then there exists a\nuniversal constant K > 1 and a K-quasiregular map \u03c8\u0303 : X \u2192 C with \u03c8\u0303 = \u03c8\noutside Y and (Y, \u03c8\u0303) being a cos-spine whose axis of symmetry passes through z0 .\nAn immediate corollary is the following.\nCorollary 1. Let (X, \u03c8) be a Riemann surface spread over the sphere and (Y1 , \u03c8),\n(Y2 , \u03c8),. . . be mutually disjoint logarithmic staircases in (X, \u03c8). Furthermore, let zj\nbe a point on \u2202Yj with \u03c8(zj ) \u2208 R. Then there exists a Riemann surface (X, \u03c8\u0303) of\nS\nthe same type as (X, \u03c8), where \u03c8\u0303 = \u03c8 outside j Yj , and \u03c8\u0303|Yj is a cos-spine for\neach j with its axis of symmetry passing through zj .\nProof. If we apply Theorem 2 to each logarithmic staircase separately, we obtain\na quasiregular map \u03c8\u0303 : X \u2192 C with the desired net. This implies that the conformal structures induced by \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0303 are quasiconformally equivalent. The type of a\nsimply connected Riemann surface is preserved under quasiconformal homeomorphisms.\n\u0003\nBefore proving Theorem 2 we need some preliminary results.\nLet S denote the strip {0 < Im z < 1}.\nLemma 1. Let f0 , f1 : R \u2192 R be diffeomorphisms and M \u2265 1 with 1/M \u2264 fk\u2032 (x) \u2264\nM and |f0 (x) \u2212 f1 (x)| \u2264 M \u2212 1 for k = 0, 1 and all x \u2208 R. Then there exists a\nK(M )-quasiconformal map f : S \u2192 S with f (x + ik) = fk (x) + ik for k = 0, 1.\nFurthermore, limM\u21921 K(M ) = 1.\n\n\fA HYPERBOLIC SURFACE WITH A SQUARE GRID NET\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Topological picture of the net of the function in Lemma 2.\nProof. Define f (x + iy) := (1 \u2212 y)f0 (x) + yf1 (x) + iy in S. The fact that f0 and\nf1 are increasing homeomorphisms of the real line immediately implies that f is\na homeomorphism of S onto itself, preserving boundary components. The partial\nderivatives are\nfx (x + iy) =\nfy (x + iy) =\n\n(1 \u2212 y)f0\u2032 (x) + yf1\u2032 (x),\nf1 (x) \u2212 f0 (x) + i.\n\nViewing the complex plane as R2 , the matrix of the differential is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1 \u2212 y)f0\u2032 (x) + yf1\u2032 (x) f1 (x) \u2212 f0 (x).\nDf (x, y) =\n0\n1\n\nThus Jf (x, y) = (1 \u2212 y)f0\u2032 (x) + yf1\u2032 (x) \u2265 1/M and kDf (x, y)k \u2264 max(1, (1 \u2212\ny)f0\u2032 (x) + yf1\u2032 (x) + |f1 (x) \u2212 f0 (x)|) \u2264 2M \u2212 1.

A function G :\nD \u2192 C is called real if G(w) = G(w) for all w \u2208 D.\nLemma 2. There exists a real quasiregular function G : {Re w \u2264 1} \u2192 C and a\nconstant M > 0 such that\n(1) G(w) = ew for Re w = 1 and for Re w \u2264 \u2212M \u2212 1\n(2) G has one real critical point and the preimage of the real line consists of\ninfinitely many mutually disjoint rays to \u221e that start on the line {Re w =\n1}, and an arc which has two endpoints on that line, intersects the real axis\nonce, and is disjoint from all other rays (see Figure 4).\n\nProof.

For interpolation in S \u2032 we will use Lemma 1 and thus we have to check the\nconditions for the lifts (logarithms) of the boundary mappings of H on {Re w = 0}\nand exp on {Re w = 1}. In our case f1 is the identity mapping as the imaginary\npart of the logarithm of exp(1 + ix). For f0 we get\nf0 (x)\n\nIm log H(ix)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4 + ix\n+ ix\n= Im log\n\u22124 + ix\n8x\n= x + arctan\n.\n16 + x2\nFrom the boundedness of the arctangent we immediately have |f1 (x) \u2212 f0 (x)| \u2264\nFurthermore,\nf0\u2032 (x)\n\n=\n\n= 1+\n\n\u03c0\n2.\n\n8(16 \u2212 x2 )\n,\n(16 + x2 )2 + 64x2\n\nfrom which we get\n|8(16 \u2212 x2 )|\n1\n\u2264\n|(16 + x2 )2 + 64x2 |\n2\nfor all x \u2208 R. An application of Lemma 1 shows that there exists a quasiconformal\nmap G\u0303 in S \u2032 with boundary values log H(w) on {Re w = 0} and w on {Re w =\n1}. Then G = exp \u25e6G\u0303 is quasiregular in S \u2032 with boundary values H and exp,\nrespectively.\n|f0\u2032 (x) \u2212 1| =\n\nFor interpolation in S \u2032\u2032 , fix an increasing C \u221e -function \u03b7 : R \u2192 [0, 1] with \u03b7(t) = 0\nfor t < \u22121 and \u03b7(t) = 1 for t > 0.
