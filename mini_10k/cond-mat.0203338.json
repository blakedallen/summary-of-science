We find that the Cooper pair resonance process allows for a much better measurement\nthan a similar non-superconducting SET, and can approach the quantum limit of efficiency.\nPACS numbers: 73.20.Dx., 73.23.Hk, 73.40.Gk\n\nAmong the many open issues related to solid state\nquantum computation, the question of how best to measure a solid state qubit remains a particularly interesting\none. In the case where the qubit is a Cooper pair box (i.e.\na Josephson-junction single charge box), the standard\nchoice for a read-out device is the single-electron transistor (SET) [1\u20136]. An alternate and potentially more\npowerful approach is to use a superconducting single electron transistor (SSET) biased at a point where the cyclic\nresonant tunneling of Cooper pairs dominates transport\n[7\u201311] [12]. Such processes, known as Josephson quasiparticle (JQP) resonances, would appear to be an attractive choice for use in a measurement as their resonance\nstructure implies an extremely high sensitivity. However,\nprecisely because of their large gain, these processes may\nbe expected to strongly alter the state of the qubit in a\nmeasurement. To assess the balance between these two\nopposing tendencies, a close examination of the physics\nof JQP tunneling is required. Note that the SSET-qubit\nsystem is more relevant to experiment than a setup having a SET, as fabrication typically results in the entire\nsystem being made from a single metal.\nIn this paper, we focus on a double JQP process\n(DJQP) (see Fig. 1), which occurs at a lower SSET\nsource-drain voltage than single JQP processes, and\nwhich has been used in a recent experiment [13]. We\nassess the potential of DJQP to act as a one-shot measurement of the state of a Cooper pair box qubit. This\ninvolves characterizing both \u03c4meas , the time needed to\ndiscriminate the two qubit states in the measurement,\nand the back-action of the measurement on the qubit,\nwhich is described by a mixing rate \u0393mix and a dephasing rate \u03c4\u03c6 . These quantities are intimately related to\nthe noise properties of the SSET, which are of fundamental interest in themselves, given the novel nature of\nthe DJQP process. \u03c4meas is determined largely by the\nshot noise of the process, while \u0393mix and \u03c4\u03c6 are related\nto the associated charge noise on the SSET island. While\nthe shot noise of a single JQP process has been analyzed\nrecently [14], the quantum charge noise has not been addressed. It is of particular interest, as the experiment of\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic showing the four steps of the double\nJosephson quasiparticle process which can occur in a superconducting single-electron transistor. Circles represent the\ncentral island of the SSET, while the rectangles are the electrodes. Numbers indicate the charge of the SSET island.\n\nRef. [13] uses the ability of a qubit to act as a spectrum\nanalyzer of this quantum charge noise.\nTo describe the measurement process in our system,\nwe employ a density matrix description of the fully coupled SSET plus qubit system; this is similar to the approach taken by Makhlin et al. [4] for a SET, but extended to deal with Josephson tunneling. This approach\nis not limited by a requirement of weak-coupling, as are\nstandard approaches which perturbatively link \u0393mix to\nthe transistor charge noise [5,6]; nonetheless, in the limit\nof weak-coupling the present method can be used to calculate the quantum charge noise of the SSET. We find\nthat the quantum (i.e. asymmetric in frequency) nature\nof the noise is particularly pronounced for the DJQP feature, leading to regimes where the SSET can strongly\nrelax the qubit. Moreover, due to the resonant nature\nof Cooper pair tunneling, there exist regimes where the\nSSET can cause a pronounced population inversion in\nthe Cooper pair box, something that is impossible using a SET. For typical device parameters, we find that a\nfar better single-shot measurement is possible using the\nDJQP process than with a comparable SET.\nModel\u2013 The Hamiltonian of the coupled qubit plus\nSSET system is is written as H = HS + HQ + Hint . The\nqubit itself (or \"box\"), described by HQ , consists of a\nsuperconducting metal island in the Coulomb blockade\nregime where only two charge states are relevant. These\ncan be regarded as the \u03c3z eigenstates of a fictitious spin\n\n1\n\n\f1/2. The island is attached via a tunnel junction to a\nbulk superconducting electrode, leading to the form\n1\nHQ = \u2212 [(4ECQ (1 \u2212 NQ )) \u03c3z + EJQ \u03c3x ] .\n2\n\nevolution of \u03c1 is calculated perturbatively in the tunneling Hamiltonian HT , keeping only the lowest order terms;\nthis corresponds to the neglect of co-tunneling processes,\nwhich is valid for small g and near the DJQP resonance.\nUsing an interaction representation where HT is viewed\nas a perturbation, the equation of motion of \u03c1 takes the\nstandard form:\nZ t\nd\ndt\u2032 h[HT (t), [HT (t\u2032 ), \u03c1(t\u2032 ) \u2297 \u03c1F ]]i (3)\n\u03c1(t) = \u2212\ndt\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ECQ is the charging energy of the box, EJQ is\nthe Josephson coupling energy of the box, and NQ is\nthe dimensionless gate voltage applied to the box. The\nSSET consists of a superconducting, Coulomb-blockaded\nisland which is attached via tunnel junctions to two superconducting electrodes (Fig. 1). The SSET Hamiltonian HS = HK +HC +HV +HT has a term HK describing\nthe kinetic energy of source, drain and central island electrons, a term HV which describes the work done by the\nvoltage sources, and a tunneling term HT . The charging\nterm is HC = ECS (nS \u2212 NS )2 , where ECS is the SSET\ncharging energy, nS is the number of electrons on the\ncentral island, and NS is the dimensionless gate voltage\napplied to the island. Finally, the qubit is capacitively\nC\ncoupled to the SSET: Hint = 2ECQ C\nC\u03a3 \u03c3z nS \u2261 Eint \u03c3z nS .\nHere CC is the cross-capacitance between the box and the\ncentral island of the SSET, and C\u03a3 is the total capacitance of the SSET island. Note that we neglect the coupling of the qubit to its environment, as we are interested\nhere in the intrinsic effect of the SSET on the qubit [15].\nWe also assume a SSET with identical tunnel junctions,\nwhose dimensionless conductance g satisfies g/(2\u03c0) \u226a 1.\nThe DJQP process occurs when the SSET gate voltage NS and drain-source voltage 2VDS are such that two\nCooper-pair tunneling transitions (one in each junction)\nare resonant. We label these transitions as ns = 0 \u2192 2\n(left junction) and ns = 1 \u2192 \u22121 (right junction) (see\nFig. 1). Resonance thus requires eVDS = ECS and\nNS = 1/2. In addition, ECS /\u2206S (where \u2206S is the superconducting gap of the SSET) must be chosen so that the\nquasiparticle transitions linking the two Cooper pair resonances are energetically allowed (i.e. nS = 2 \u2192 1 and\nnS = \u22121 \u2192 0), whereas transitions which end the cycle\n(i.e. nS = 0 \u2192 1) are not. We take ECS = \u2206S to satisfy these conditions; this corresponds to the experiment\nof Ref. [13]. The two quasiparticle transitions which occur in the DJQP are characterized by a rate \u0393, which is\ngiven by the usual expression for quasiparticle tunneling\nbetween two superconductors [16]. The effective Cooper\npair tunneling rate \u03b3J emerging from our description (i.e.\nEq. (3) below) is given by [8]:\n\u03b3J (\u03b4) =\n\n4 (\u03b4 2\n\n2\nEJS\n\u0393\n+ (\u0393/2)2 )\n\nThe angular brackets denote the trace over SSET fermion\ndegrees of freedom; as we work at zero temperature, \u03c1F\nis the density matrix corresponding to ground state of\nthese degrees of freedom in the absence of tunneling. In\nthe diagrammatic language of Ref. [17], Eq. (3) is equivalent to keeping all HT2 terms in the self-energy of the\nKeldysh propagator governing the evolution of \u03c1. Note\nthat the correlators in Eq. (3) describe both quasiparticle\ntunneling and Josephson tunneling in the SSET.\nTo make further progress, we treat the Josephson coupling emerging from Eq. (3) as energy-independent and\ngiven by the Ambegaokar-Baratoff value EJS = g\u2206S /8.\nWe also use the smallness of g to neglect logarithmic\nrenormalization terms, as was done in Ref. [4]. One can\nthen immediately solve for the time-independent solution\nof Eq. (3), which describes the quasi-equilibrium state\nachieved by the system after all mixing and dephasing\nof the qubit by the SSET has occurred. To describe the\ndynamics of mixing (i.e. the relaxation of the qubit state\npopulations to their stationary value), we also calculate\nthe corresponding eigenmode of Eq. (3). A Markov approximation is made which involves replacing \u03c1(t\u2032 ) by\n\u03c1(t) on the RHS of Eq. (3); for the mixing mode, this\nshould be done in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture [18]. This approximation is justified as long as the time dependence\nof \u03c1 in the mixing mode is weak compared to typical frequencies appearing in the correlators of Eq. (3), requiring\nhere that \u0393mix < \u0393, ECS and EJS < ECS [18].\nBack-Action\u2013 We focus here primarily on the mixing\neffect of the measurement back-action; dephasing will be\ndiscussed more extensively in Ref. [18]. The mixing rate\n\u0393mix = \u0393rel + \u0393exc is set by the rates at which the measurement relaxes and excites the qubit. Let \u03a9 denote the\nNQ -dependent energy difference between the two qubit\nstates. For weak coupling (Eint \u226a \u03a9), Fermi's Golden\nrule relates \u0393rel and \u0393exc toR the quantum charge noise of\nthe SSET island SQ (\u03c9) = dt e\u2212i\u03c9t hnS (t)nS (0)i:\n\n(2)\n\n\u0393rel/exc =\n\nHere, \u03b4 is the energy difference between the two charge\nstates involved in tunneling, EJS is the Josephson energy\nof the SSET, and we set h\u0304 = 1.\nCalculation Approach\u2013 We consider the reduced density matrix \u03c1 of the qubit plus SSET system obtained by\ntracing out the SSET fermionic degrees of freedom.

(3). In the limit of weak coupling,\none can then use Eq. (4) to extract SQ (\u03a9). Our method\n2\n\n\fNS or VDS slightly off the DJQP resonance center. Unlike the case of a SET, where asymmetries in the noise\nare weak for these frequencies, there are strong features\nhere that result from the resonant nature of Cooper pair\ntunneling. By treating the mixing terms in Eq. (3) perturbatively, simple analytic expressions can be obtained\nfor the quantum noise in this regime when EJS < \u0393 (in\nRef. [13], EJS /(h\u0393) \u2243 0.04). If one moves away from\nthe DJQP center by tuning only VDS (i.e. NS = 1/2,\neVDS = ECS + \u03b4V /2), we find (|\u03c9| < ECS ):\n\n\u221210\n\nS (\u03c9) (seconds)\n\n10\n\nQubit Charge\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\nQubit Gate Voltage\n\n2\n\nQ\n\n0\n0\n\nOn Resonance\nOff Resonance\n10\n\u03c9 / E (E = \u2206 )\n\u22121\n1\nCS\nCS\nS\nFIG. 2.

As in Ref. 13, we have ECQ \u2243 77\u03bceV\nand EJ Q \u2243 27\u03bceV . The frequency range probed by tuning\nNQ matches the range of the main plot; the sharp steps in\nthe average charge occur at \u03a9(NQ ) \u2243 ECS .\n\u221215\n\nSQ (\u03c9) = \u03b3J (\u03b4V )\n\n[\u03b3J (\u03b4V + \u03c9)/\u03b3J (\u03b4V \u2212 \u03c9)]\n[4\u03b3J (\u03b4V + \u03c9)\u03b3J (\u03b4V \u2212 \u03c9)] + \u03c9 2\n\n(5)\n\nIn the limit where \u03c9 is much smaller than the width \u0393/2\nof the Cooper pair resonance, Eq. (5) simply corresponds\nto classical telegraph noise (the SSET only spends appreciable time in the states nS = 0 and nS = 1). However,\nfor finite \u03b4V and \u03c9, Eq. (5) indicates that the noise develops a pronounced asymmetry, even though |\u03c9| \u226a EC .\nIn particular, if \u03b4V > 0, one has SQ (\u2212|\u03c9|) > SQ (+|\u03c9|),\nimplying that emission by the SSET exceeds absorption.\nThis behavior is shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 2,\nwhich correspond to NS = 1/2, \u03b4V = +\u0393/4. This effect is a direct consequence of the resonant nature of\nCooper pair tunneling\u2013 by emitting energy, both Cooper\npair tunneling processes in the DJQP cycle become more\nresonant, while absorbing energy pushes them even further from resonance. The net result is a population inversion in the qubit at zero temperature, which in turn\nleads to a striking, non-monotonic dependence of qubit\ncharge on NQ (this is shown by the dashed curve in the\ninset of Fig. 2) [15]. Note that if one moves away from\nthe center of the DJQP resonance by only changing the\ngate voltage NS , no asymmetry in the noise results, as\nnow emission (or absorption) moves one of the Cooperpair transitions in the DJQP process further towards resonance, while it moves the other transition further away\nfrom resonance. Nonetheless, the noise in this case still\nhas a non-monotonic dependence on frequency. Letting\n\u03b4V = 0 and \u03b4N = 4ECS (NS \u2212 1/2), we have for EJS < \u0393:\n\nfor calculating the quantum noise, which uses the qubit as\na spectrum analyzer, is physically intuitive and no more\ndifficult to implement than standard approaches [6]; in\naddition, we are able to calculate \u0393rel and \u0393exc when the\ncoupling is not weak, and Eq. (4) fails.\nFig. 2 displays the quantum charge noise obtained at\nzero temperature, using SSET parameters which correspond to Ref. [13]. The solid curve in Fig. 2 is for the\ncenter of the DJQP resonance\u2013 NS = 1/2, eVDS = ECS .\nNote the sudden asymmetry that develops between absorption (i.e. SQ (+|\u03c9|)) and emission (i.e SQ (\u2212|\u03c9|))\nwhen |\u03c9| increases beyond ECS . These sudden jumps\ncorrespond to the opening and closing of transport channels in the SSET, and their sharpness (which is absent\nfor similar processes in a SET [6]) is a direct consequence\nof the singularity in the quasiparticle density of states.\nFor example, as \u03c9 rises past ECS , quasiparticle transitions which are normally forbidden in the DJQP cycle\n(i.e. nS = 0 \u2192 1) suddenly become energetically allowed\nif they absorb energy from the qubit, causing a sudden\nincrease in SQ (\u03c9).\nThe effect of the SSET quantum charge noise on the\nqubit is shown in the inset of Fig. 2, where the average\nqubit charge hNB i \u2261 1 + h\u03c3z i for t \u226b \u03c4mix is shown\nas a function of NQ . Changing NQ tunes the qubit\nsplitting frequency \u03a9, allowing one to effectively probe\nthe frequency dependence of the noise. The solid black\ncurve corresponds to being at the center of the DJQP\nfeature, while the grey curve corresponds to the unperturbed qubit ground state. The sharp features in the\nquantum noise manifest themselves in hNB i, a quantity\nwhich is directly accessible in experiment.\nEven more interesting are features emerging in the low\nfrequency quantum noise (|\u03c9| \u226a ECS ) when one tunes\n\n1+\nSQ (\u03c9) = \u03b3J (\u03b4N )\n\n(8\u03b4N \u03c9)2\n4 /2 \u03b3J (\u03b4N\nEJS\n\n\u2212 \u03c9)\u03b3J (\u03b4N + \u03c9)\n\n[4\u03b3J (\u03b4N + \u03c9)\u03b3J (\u03b4N \u2212 \u03c9)] + \u03c9 2\n\n(6)\n\nMeasurement Rate\u2013 To determine the measurement\ntime \u03c4meas , we extend our density matrix description to\nalso include m, the number of electrons that have tunnelled through the left SSET junction [4,14] [19]. We are\nthus able to calculate the distribution of tunnelled electrons P (m, t|i), where i =\u2191, \u2193 denotes the initial state of\nthe qubit. \u03c4meas is defined as the minimum time needed\nbefore the two distributions P (m, t| \u2191) and P (m, t| \u2193) are\nstatistically distinguishable [4]:\n!2\nI\u2191 \u2212 I\u2193\n1\np\n,\n(7)\n= p\n\u03c4meas\n2f\u2191 I\u2191 + 2f \u2193I\u2193\n3\n\n\fHere, I\u2191 and I\u2193 are the average SSET currents associated with the two qubit states, and f\u2191 and f\u2193 are the\nassociated Fano factors which govern the zero-frequency\nshot noise in the current (i.e. the distribution P (m, t|i) is\nroughlyp\nGaussian with a mean (Ii /e)t and standard deviation fi (Ii /e)t). In the absence of the qubit, analysis\nof the density matrix equations for the SSET reveals:\n\"\n\u0001 #\n2\n3(\u0393/2)2 \u2212 \u03b4 2\n1 EJS\n3\n1\u2212\nf (\u03b4) =\n,\n(8)\n2 /2)2\n2\n2 ([\u0393/2]2 + \u03b4 2 + EJS\n\n1/ \u03c4meas\n\u0393mix\n\u22125\n\nRate / \u0393\n\n10\n\n\u03c7\n\n0.5\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\nwhere we take eVDS = ECS , \u03b4 = \u03b4N = 4ECS (NS \u2212 1/2).\nEq. (8) indicates that the effective charge of the carriers\nin the DJQP process is 3e/2 in the limit where \u0393 \u226b EJS .\nIn this limit, Cooper-pair tunneling is the rate-limiting\nstep in the cycle; electrons effectively tunnel in clumps of\ne or 2e, leading to an average charge of 3e/2. A similar\nargument holds in the opposite regime \u0393 \u226a EJS .\nWe consider \u03c4meas in the limit of weak coupling (Eint \u226a\n\u03a9) and weak mixing (EJQ \u226a \u03a9). In this limit, the two\nqubit states simply provide an effective shift in the SSET\ngate voltage. Taking \u03b4V = 0 and \u03b4N = \u0393/2 for near optimal gain, and using Eqs. (6-8), we find that the intrinsic\nsignal-to-noise ratio (\u03c4meas \u0393mix )\u22121/2 of the measurement,\nin the relevant regime EJS < \u0393, is given by:\nr\n\u03a9\n4\n(S/N )DJQP =\n|cot \u03b8|\n.\n(9)\n3\n\u0393/2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n3\n\nQubit Gate Voltage\n\nE /\u0393\n4 JS\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3. 1/\u03c4meas , \u0393rel , and \u0393exc vs. qubit gate voltage\nNQ for a strongly coupled system, where Eint /EJ Q \u2243 0.3\n(i.e. CC /C\u03a3 = 0.05). A good measurement is possible for\na wide range of gate voltages. Inset: Heisenberg efficiency\n\u03c7 = \u03c4\u03c6 /\u03c4meas at weak coupling, as a function of EJ S /\u0393.\n\nWe have also studied the \"Heisenberg efficiency\" \u03c7 =\n\u03c4\u03c6 /\u03c4meas of measurement using DJQP for a weak coupling (Eint \u226a EJS , \u0393) and \u03a9 < ECS , where \u03c4\u03c6 is the\nmeasurement-induced dephasing time [18]. Unlike an\nSET in the sequential tunneling regime, where \u03c7 \u221d g 2\nis always much less than the quantum limit \u03c7 = 1 [3,4],\nhere \u03c7 is controlled by the ratio EJS /\u0393. As shown in the\ninset of Fig. 3, by tuning this ratio, \u03c7 can be made to approach the quantum limit. Here, for each value of EJS /\u0393\nwe have set VDS and NS to optimize the gain. Measurement using DJQP is able to reach a high efficiency when\nEJS \u2243 \u0393 both because of the symmetry of the process,\nand because of the coherent nature of Josephson tunneling [18]. Clearly, the DJQP process allows for a far\nsuperior measurement of a Cooper pair box qubit than a\nSET.\nWe thank M. Devoret, K. Lehnert and R. Schoelkopf\nfor useful discussions. This work was supported by\nthe NSF under Grants No. DMR-0084501 and DMR0196503, and by the Army Research Office under Grant\nNo. ARO-43387-PH-QC.\n\nHere, cot \u03b8 \u2261 4ECQ (1 \u2212 NQ )/EJQ , and we take \u03b3J (0) \u226a\n\u03a9 < ECS . If a SET in the sequential-tunneling regime\nis used for the qubit measurement, it was found in Refs.\n[3,4] that the optimal S/N is given by (\u03a9 < ECS ):\ns\u0012\n\u00132\ng2\n\u03a9\n(10)\n+ 2,\n(S/N )SET = \u03bb |cot \u03b8|\neVDS\n\u03c0\nwhere \u03bb is of order unity. As the quasiparticle transition\ng\nrate \u0393 \u223c 2\u03c0\neVDS , we see that the S/N achieved using\nDJQP is parametrically larger (in 2\u03c0/g \u226b 1) than that\nobtained for the SET. This enhancement results largely\nfrom the narrow width of the DJQP feature\u2013 the energy\nscale over which the current changes (and thus the gain)\nis set by \u0393 rather than VDS . The gain and S/N ratio of the SET could be improved by working in the cotunneling regime; however, this would result in a much\nlarger \u03c4meas (\u03c4meas \u221d g \u22122 ), making one more susceptible to unwanted environmental effects. In contrast, the\nDJQP feature has both a large gain and a short \u03c4meas\n(i.e. \u03c4meas \u221d 1/g). Shown in Fig. 3 as a function of\nNQ are \u03c4meas , \u0393rel and \u0393exc for a strongly coupled device\n(CC /C\u03a3 = 0.05), with all other parameters corresponding to Ref. [13]. We have taken \u03b4V = 0 and \u03b4N = \u0393/2 for\noptimal gain. Fig. 3 confirms that an excellent measurement is indeed possible, with (S/N )2 > 100. Note that\nthe strong coupling splits the sharp features occurring in\nthe noise (see Fig 2, solid curve).\n\n[1] R. J. Schoelkopf et al., Science 280, 1238 (1998).\n[2] Korotkov, A.
