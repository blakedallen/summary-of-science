The rich nodes and the connectivity between themselves (rich\u2013club connectivity) tend\nto dominate the organisation of network structure. Recently there has been a considerable effort\nto characterise and model the rich\u2013club connectivity in a variety of complex networks. In this\npaper we firstly clarify a number of terms: the rich-club coefficient quantifies the density of\nconnectivity between a subset of rich nodes; the rich-club structure is the rich-club coefficient\nmeasured across the hierarchies of nodes; the rich-club phenomenon refers to the dynamic\nbehaviour responsible for the formation of the rich\u2013club connectivity in evolving networks;\nand the rich-club ordering discerns whether the connectivity between rich nodes in a nonevolving network (i.e. closed network or network snapshot) is higher than a reference network\nobtained by network randomisation. We then evaluate a recently proposed null model which is\nbased on an ensemble of reference networks conserving the degree distribution of the original\nnetwork. We remark that one should not confuse the rich-club structure of a network with\nthe rich-club ordering detected by the null model. We also demonstrate that the null model\ncannot identify the dynamical mechanism that generates the rich\u2013club connectivity. The main\ncontribution of the paper is that we introduce two new ensembles of reference networks based\non the rich-club structure for non\u2013evolving networks. The first ensemble preserves the rich-club\ncoefficient (as a function of the rank of a node) of the original network. Members of the ensemble\nexhibit similar degree distribution as the original network, and for assortative networks, similar\nassortative mixing as well. We propose that this ensemble can be used to study networks where\nassortativeness is a fundamental property, e.g. to detect the community structure in social\nnetworks. Analysis on the ensemble also provides a different way to interpret and model the\nevolution of social networks. The second ensemble preserves both the degree distribution and\nthe rich\u2013club coefficient (as a function of node degree). The reference networks in this ensemble\nhave a similar structure as the original network. We use them to quantify the correlation profile\nbetween the rich nodes and pinpoint which links between the nodes are the backbone of network\nstructure.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany social, economic, biological and technological networks contain a small set of nodes which\nhave large numbers of links, the so\u2013called rich nodes. In some networks the rich nodes are tightly\ninterconnected between themselves, forming a rich\u2013club [31]. The rich\u2013club is an oligarchy in that\nit dominates the organisation of the whole network. In scale\u2013free networks [1] the connectivity\n1\n\n\fbetween the rich nodes plays an important role in network functionality, for example in the transmission of rumours in social networks [15] or the efficient delivery of data packets in the Internet [30].\nThe density of connections between the rich nodes is quantified by the rich\u2013club coefficient [31].\nThe rich\u2013club coefficient and its generalisations [8, 16, 28, 33, 23, 25] have been proved to be a\nuseful measure for studying complex networks.\nMany of the complex networks studied in the literature are single networks in the sense that\neach network's structure is not one of several but unique, for example the Internet. In this case we\ndo not have the equivalent to a physical law to verify whether a statistical measure obtained from a\nsingle network is expected or extraordinary. Instead, a common technique to assess the significance\nof a property of a single network is to use the statistical randomisation method [12] to create a\nnull model. The procedure consists of using the observed network to generate an ensemble [5] of\nreference networks via randomisation. The null model is then generated from this ensemble.\nIn this paper we study three ensembles of reference networks which are generated by different\nnetwork randomisation processes. The first ensemble has been widely studied. In one recent study\nit was used to assess whether the connectivity between the rich nodes in a network is due to chance\nor an unknown mechanism. We discuss the results and clarify the confusions arising from the study.\nWe then introduce the other two ensembles, which are based on the rich\u2013club structure for nonevolving networks. We analyse their properties and propose useful applications for the statistical\nphysics study on complex networks. Our work not only advances the understanding of the rich-club\nstructure in networks but also provides new methods for studying other properties related to the\nrich-club structure.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDefinitions\nThe rich\u2013club coefficient and the rich-club structure\n\nDegree of a node, k, the number of links a node has. The rank r of a node is its position in the\nlist of decreasing order of node degrees, i.e. the best-connected node is ranked as r = 1, the second\nbest-connected node is r = 2 and so on. Rich nodes can be defined as nodes with large degrees or\nsmall ranks. The density of connections between the r richest nodes is quantified by the rich\u2013club\ncoefficient [31]\n2E6r\n\u03a6(r) =\n,\n(1)\nr(r \u2212 1)\nwhere E6r is the number of links between the r nodes and r(r \u2212 1)/2 is the maximum number of\nlinks that these nodes can share. If \u03a6(r) = 0 the nodes do not share any link at all, if \u03a6(r) = 1 the\nnodes form a fully connected sub\u2013graph, a clique. As a function of degree, the rich\u2013club coefficient\ncan also be given as [8]\n2E>k\n\u03c6(k) =\n,\n(2)\nN>k (N>k \u2212 1)\nwhere N>k is the number of nodes with degrees greater or equal to k and E>k is the number of\nlinks between the N>k nodes.\nThe rich\u2013club coefficients \u03a6(r) and \u03c6(k) are related but they are not the same. The rank gives a\nunique label to each node, and the degree can be used to group nodes into subsets. If rk\u2217 is the node\nwith degree k such that rk\u2217 + 1 is the rank of the node with degree k \u2212 1, then \u03c6(k) = \u03a6(rk\u2217 ). This\nis to say, {\u03c6(k)|k = 0, . . . , kmax } is a subset of {\u03a6(r)|r = 1, . . . , N }, where kmax is the maximum\n2\n\n\fdegree in the network and N is the total number of nodes. Two networks can have the same \u03c6(k)\nand the same degree distribution P (k) for all k, but different \u03a6(r).\nOriginally the term rich\u2013club was defined as the set of the richest nodes that are tightly interconnected. This definition is vague as 'tight' is a relative concept. Recently, Valverde and Sol\u00e9 [27]\nproposed a criteria to define the rich\u2013club and hence the rich nodes. The rich\u2013club is defined by\nthe existence of a crossover at kc in \u03c6(k) (or rc in \u03a6(r)) and this crossover characterise the rich\nnodes.\nThe rich\u2013club structure refers to the density of connections across the hierarchies of nodes. It\nis given by the rich\u2013club coefficient \u03c6(k) for all k (or \u03a6(r) for all r). The rich\u2013club structure can\nbe fully defined by the degree\u2013degree distribution, P (k, k 0 ), the probability that an arbitrary link\nconnects a node of degree k with a node of degree k 0 [8],\nP\nPkmax\n0 00\nN hki kkmax\n0 =k\nk00 =k P (k , k )\n\u03c6(k) =\n,\n(3)\nPkmax\nP\n0\n(N k0 =k P (k 0 ))(N kkmax\n0 =k P (k ) \u2212 1)\nwhere hki is the average degree. Conversely, we show in the following that fixing the rich\u2013club\nstructure will constrain the degree\u2013degree distribution [32, 11]. From the definition of the rich\u2013\nclub coefficient \u03c6(k), the number of links that have at one end a node with degree k and at the\nother end a node with degree at least k is\nEk = E>k \u2212 E>k+1 = \u03c6(k)\n\nN>k (N>k \u2212 1)\nN>k+1 (N>k+1 + 1)\n\u2212 \u03c6(k + 1)\n.\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nIn terms of the conditional probability P (k 0 |k) that a node with degree k has a neighbour with\ndegree k 0 ,\n!\nkX\nmax\n1\n0\nEk = 2N P (k)\nP (k |k) \u2212 P (k + 1|k) ,\n(5)\n2\n0\nk =k\n\nwhere is N P (k) is the number of nodes with degree k, and the term P (k 0 |k) \u2212 12 P (k + 1|k) gives\nthe proportion of these nodes that are connected to a node with degree at\nPleast k.0 We know that\n0\n0\n0\n0\nP (k, k ) and P (k |k) are related as P (k |k) = hkiP (k, k )/(kP (k)) where k0 P (k |k) = 1. Hence,\nfixing \u03c6(k) for all k constrains the possible values of P (k|k 0 ) or equivalently P (k, k 0 ).\n\n2.2\n\nThe rich\u2013club phenomenon and the rich\u2013club ordering\n\nThe rich\u2013club phenomenon [31] refers to the dynamic behaviour in some evolving networks where,\nif a node becomes rich, it will tend to connect with other rich nodes forming a rich\u2013club or join an\nexisting rich\u2013club. An evolving network model can introduce such dynamic mechanisms to reproduce the rich-club phenomenon and therefore generate a network with similar rich\u2013club structure\nas the real network [7, 3, 31, 29]. One such mechanism was introduced in 1942 by Simon [26]. Simon's model was based on the addition of new nodes and the addition of new links between nodes\nthat belong to the same class, where a class is the set of nodes with the same degree. Bornholdt\nand Ebel [7] have pointed out that this growth mechanism allows different growth rate for different\nclasses of nodes and hence it can create a rich\u2013club clique. Recently Krapivsky and Krioukov [11]\nshowed how the inclusion of the rich\u2013club phenomenon in evolving networks drastically constraints\ntheir structure.\nThe term rich\u2013club phenomenon has been mixed with the term rich\u2013club ordering in the recent study [8] which compared the rich-club coefficient of the original network against a reference\n3\n\n\fnetwork. We suggest to use the term rich\u2013club ordering to refer to the increase of rich-club coefficient in comparison with the reference network. It is a static property obtained for non\u2013evolving\nnetworks (closed networks) or a snapshot of evolving networks.\n\n3\n\nThe relative rich\u2013club reference network\n\nA widely studied ensemble of reference networks are the maximal random networks generated by\nrandomly reshuffling link\u2013pairs of the network under study [13, 14]. The intrinsic structure of\nthe original network is taken into account by imposing the restriction that the reshuffling process\nshould not change the degree distribution.\nRecently Colizza et al. [8] used this ensemble as a null model to discern whether the connections\nbetween the rich nodes in a network is due to chance or due to an \"organisational principle\". To\ndo so, they compared the original rich\u2013club coefficient \u03c6(k) with the randomised rich\u2013club coefficient \u03c6ran (k) obtained from the maximal random networks in the ensemble. Colizza et al. suggested\nthat the \"normalised\" rich\u2013club coefficient \u03c1ran (k) = \u03c6(k)/\u03c6ran (k) discounts the structural correlation imposed by the finite\u2013size effects [6]. If \u03c1ran (k) > 1, it means there is an organisational\nprinciple that leads to an increase in the density of connections between rich nodes in a more\npronounced way than in the null model, i.e. the rich\u2013club ordering.\nWe prefer to call \u03c1ran (k) the relative rich\u2013club coefficient. Since the number of nodes with degree\nk does not change by the randomisation procedure, \u03c1ran (k) = E>k /Eran,>k is the ratio of original\u2013\nnetwork links to the reference\u2013network links. Hence \u03c1ran (k) does not give information about the\ndensity of connections between rich nodes (which is measured by the rich\u2013club coefficient). This\nsimple observation is relevant because there has been some confusion in the literature on what the\nrich\u2013club coefficient and \u03c1ran (k) are measuring. For example Fig. 1 shows the Internet network at\nthe Autonomous System level (AS\u2013Internet) [9, 24] and for the scientific collaborations network\nin the area of condensed matter physics (Collaborations\u2013A) [17, 18]. Figs. 1(a) and (c) show the\ntwo networks' original \u03c6(k) in green colour and values of the randomised \u03c6ran (k) obtained from 103\nmaximal random networks, where the frequency of a particular value of \u03c6ran (k) is labelled with\ndifferent colours, from seldom (0.1, red) to often (1.0, blue). The null model h\u03c1ran (k)i is obtained\nby averaging over all the maximal random networks and hence corresponds to the 'bluest' dots. For\nthe AS Internet, the observation that h\u03c6ran (k)i > \u03c6(k), i.e. h\u03c1ran (k)i < 1, for almost all values of k,\nsuggests that the Internet does not have a rich\u2013club ordering. This has created the misinterpretation\nas stated in [8, 2] that the rich nodes in the AS Internet were not tightly interconnected with each\nother. However, Fig. 1(b) shows that the 20 best-connected nodes in the AS Internet are tightly\ninterconnected between themselves. Even more, the top seven best-connected nodes form a fully\nconnected clique. For the Collaborations\u2013A network, the property h\u03c6ran (k)i < \u03c6(k) insinuates that\nthe top scientists form tighter collaborations compared to the reference networks and this has been\ninterpreted in [8, 2] as the rich nodes are tightly interconnected. However, the fact is that the top\n20 best-connected nodes are sparsely interconnected in both the original network and the reference\nnetworks.\nWe remark that the rich-club ordering of a network is a relative property which is based on the\ncomparison with reference networks generated from the network itself. It should not be confused\nwith the rich-club structure which is measured and compared between different networks by the\nrich-club coefficient. Furthermore, as pointed out in [10], for both the AS\u2013Internet and Collaborations network, the range of \u03c6ran (k) increases as k increases, hence any assertion based upon the\n4\n\n\frelationship between h\u03c6ran (k)i and \u03c6(k) should be statistically tested.\nHere we show that the null model based on the maximal random networks cannot detect the richclub phenomenon, i.e. whether there is a dynamic mechanism behind the formation of a rich\u2013club.\nConsider the preferential attachment mechanism introduced by Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) [4]. The\npreferential attachment correlates the age of a node with its connectivity, i.e. 'rich\u2013gets\u2013richer'. As\nnew nodes join the network the old nodes become richer. However if two old nodes do not already\nshare a link, they will never acquire a new one during the network growth. This is to say, the\nBA growth mechanism is irrelevant to the formation of a rich\u2013club. Figure 2 shows that if a BA\nnetwork grows from a fully connected seed, i.e. a clique, it will contain a fully connected rich\u2013club;\nif it grows from a poorly connected seed, e.g. a ring, it will have a poorly connected rich\u2013club. The\nnull model h\u03c6ran (k)i will produce contradictory results for the two networks generated by the same\nBA growth mechanism. The null model in this case reflects the connectivity of the initial seeds not\nthe growth mechanism.\n\n4\n\nThe assortative reference network\n\nWe can measure whether the maximal random networks used in the above null model discount\nthe degree-degree correlation in the original\nby examining the nearest-neighbours average\nP network\n0\n0\ndegree of k-degree nodes [24], knn (k) = kkmax\n0 =1 k P (k |k). If knn (k) is an increasing function of k, a\nnetwork is assortative [19]; and if knn (k) is a decreasing function of k, a network is disassortative.\nIf knn (k) is neither an increasing nor an decreasing function of k then a network is uncorrelated,\nmore specifically, the degree of a node is independent of its neighbours' degree. If the maximal\nrandom networks are less correlated than the original network, the slope of knn (k) should be less\npronounced than the original network. Figure 3 compares knn (k) of the original network and the\nmaximal random networks for four real networks: the AS Internet, the protein interaction network\nof the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [13], the Collaborations\u2013A network, and the giant component\nof the scientific collaboration network in the area of network theory [20] (Collaborations\u2013B). Fig. 3\nshows that the AS\u2013Internet and the Protein networks are disassortative and their null models are\nalso disassortative, whereas the two collaborations networks are assortative and their null models\nare uncorrelated networks.\nThe assortative mixing is the inherent property of social networks [22]. Their maximal random\nnetworks do not reflect this property. In the following we define a new ensemble of reference\nnetworks, called assortative reference networks, which respect both the degree distribution and\nthe assortative mixing of social networks. We obtain such networks by conserving1 the original\nnetwork's rich\u2013club structure measured by the rich-club coefficient \u03a6(r) as a function of rank r.\nWe study the Collaborations\u2013A network as a typical example of assortative social networks.\n\n4.1\n\nProgressive rewiring\n\nFor a given network, we start with a random network having the same number of nodes and links\nas the original network. A link is selected and rewired at random2 . We then evaluate the square\n1\nNote that conserving \u03a6(r) does not imply that the degree distribution P (k) and the rich-club coefficient \u03c6(k) are\nthe same as in the original network.\n2\nWe avoid creating self-loop, duplicate link, or isolated node.\n\n5\n\n\f1. 0\n\n1.0\n\nAS\nInternet\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n\u03c6( k )\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0. 5\n\n11\n\n1\n\n12\n\n20\n\n0.1\n0. 0\n10 0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n13\n\n19\n18\n\n4\n\n17\n\n16\n\n14\n\n15\n\nk\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1. 0\n\n1.0\n\nCollaborations\n\n15\n\n\u03c6( k)\n\n17\n\n14\n\n16\n\n11\n\n2\n\n12\n0. 5\n\n6\n3\n\n0.1\n0. 0\n10 0\n\n10 1\n\n18\n9\n\n10 2\n\nk\n\n1\n\n13\n\n8\n\n4\n\n7\n\n10\n\n20\n\n5\n\n19\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 1: The rich\u2013club coefficient \u03c6(k) (green) and \u03c6ran (k) (red to blue) for the (a) AS\u2013Internet\nand (c) the Collaborations network.

If the rewiring decreases the value of \u2206, then\nthe rewiring is accepted; otherwise it is rejected. This procedure continues until \u2206 is small.\nThe assortative reference network obtained using this method not only conserve the rich-club\nstructure, but also resembles the degree distribution and the assortative mixing of the original\nnetwork (see Figures 4(a) and (b)). This is due to the structural constrain between the rich-club\nstructure and the degree-degree correlation (see Eqs. 4 and 5). Basically, preserving \u03a6(r) of the r\nrichest nodes means preserving the density of connections between nodes with the r highest degrees.\nCommunity detection [21] is based on the comparison between the density of connections of the\noriginal network and reference networks. The assortative reference network could be useful for\ndetecting community structures of social networks, which are inherently assortative.\n\n4.2\n\nAnalytical solution\n\nHere we give the analytical solution for the assortative reference network. From the definition of\nthe rich\u2013club coefficient \u03a6(r) (see Eq. 1), the number of links that the node with r shares with the\nr \u2212 1 nodes of smaller ranks is\nEr = E6r \u2212 E6r\u22121 = \u03a6(r)\n\nr(r \u2212 1)\n(r \u2212 1)(r \u2212 2)\n\u2212 \u03a6(r \u2212 1)\n.\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nAssuming the Er links are randomly distributed between the r \u2212 1 nodes, the probability that node\nr has a link with node r0 , where r0 < r, is\nP(r) =\n\nEr\n.\nr\u22121\n\nThus the probability that there is a link between two nodes with ranks i and j is\n(\nP(i), if i > j\npij =\nP(j), if i < j,\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nP PN\nThe above equation satisfies the property that N\ni=1\nj=1 pij = 2L, where L is the total number\nof links of the original network. For a random network which has the same number of nodes N and\nthe same rich-club structure \u03a6(r) as the original network, the degree of node i can be approximated\nby\nN\nX\nki \u2248\npij ,\n(9)\nj=1\n\nand the nearest-neighbours average degree of k-degree nodes is approximated by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nN\n1 X \uf8ed1 X\nknn (k) \u2248\npij kj \uf8f8 ,\nNk\nk\ni;ki =k\n\n(10)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the sum with index i adds the nodes that have degree equal to k and Nk is the number of\nk-degree nodes.\nFigures 4(c) and (d) confirms that the analytical solution of the assortative reference network\nhas similar P (k) and knn (k) (obtained from Eqs. 9 and 10) as the original network.

(a) (c) and (e) show\nthe degree distribution P (k); and (b) (d) and (f) show the nearest-neighbours average degree of\nk-degree nodes, knn (k). (a) and (b) are obtained from the progressive rewiring; (c) and (d) are\nfrom the analytical solution; and (e) and (f) are from the rank-based preferential attachment. The\noriginal network is shown in green and the reference network is in blue.\n9\n\n\fnetwork is assortative, i.e. high-degree nodes (with small r) tend to connect with high-degree nodes,\nwe can expect from Eq. (7) that the assortative reference network will also be assortative. However\nif the original network is disassortative, i.e. high-degree nodes tend to connect to low-degree nodes\n(with large r), Eq. (7) will not capture this property as it does not favour the connectivity between\nhigh-degree nodes and low-degree nodes.\n\nRank\u2013based preferential attachment\nEq. (8) assumes a uniform probability for node r to attach to any node r0 with r0 < r. Here we\nmodify Eq. (8) to include a preferential attachment mechanism and therefore favour the attachment\nto richer nodes with smaller r,\n(\n2jP(i)/(i + 1), if i > j\npij =\n(11)\n2iP(j)/(j + 1), if i < j.\nP\nPr\nThis expression was obtained by using N\ni=1 i = N (N + 1)/2 such that 2P (r)(r + 1)\ni=1 i = Er .\nThis is a preferential attachment based on the relative rank of nodes. Figures 4(e) and (f) show\nthat P (k) and knn (k) estimated from this rank\u2013based preferential attachment are very close to the\noriginal network.\nThis rank\u2013based preferential attachment puts across a different way to study the collaborations\nnetwork in the context of its reference network. The original network is a member of an ensemble\nwhich is defined by the density of connections between a referent group (rich nodes) and the total\nnumber of nodes. If the probability of connection between two nodes is related to their rank\ndifference, then the collaborations network looks like a typical member of the ensemble. This\nprovides a different way to conjecture how collaborations between scientists arise. In general, a\nscientist will prefer to work with a scientist of the same or higher status, where status is a relative\nconcept3 .\n\n5\n\nThe reference network preserving P (k) and \u03c6(k)\n\nRecently we introduced another ensemble of reference networks which are obtained by randomly\nreshuffling link\u2013pairs of the original network with the restriction that both P (k) and \u03c6(k) are\npreserved for all k [32]. Consider a pair of links with end nodes n1 , n2 , n3 and n4 with degrees\nk1 < k2 < k3 < k4 respectively. If node n1 is linked to n2 and n3 is linked to n4 , we call they are\nassortatively wired. If a randomly chosen pair of links are assortatively wired they are discarded\nand a new pair is considered; otherwise the four end nodes of the links are reshuffled at random.\nThe procedure is repeated for a large number of times. Reshuffling a pair of links which are not\nassortatively wired does not changes the number of links between nodes with degrees equal or larger\nthan k, hence \u03c6(k) is preserved. Notice that this randomisation procedure also conserves the degree\ndistribution P (k). Fig. 5 shows that the original network and the reference networks obtained from\nthis method show similar degree-degree correlation, and therefore have similar network structure.\n3\n\nThis does not explain why the higher\u2013status scientist will agree to collaborate, perhaps to carry on more work,\nor to keep his/her high status.\n\n10\n\n\f600\n\n45\n\nInternet\n\"avknnIntOriginal.dat\" u 1:($2/$3)\n\"statsInternetPhi.dat\" u 1:2:3\n400\n\nknn\n\nProtein\n\n40\n\n500\n\n26\n\n\"avKnnProtOriginal.dat\" u 1:($2/$3)\n\"statsProtPhi.dat\" u 1:2:3\n\n24\n\n35\n20\n30\n\n18\n\nknn\n\nknn 25\n\n300\n\n16\n14\n\n20\n\n200\n\nCollaborations\n\n\"avKnnScOr.dat\" u 1:($2/$3)\n\"statsKnnSciPhi.dat\" u 1:2:3\n\n22\n\n12\n15\n10\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\nk\n(a)\n\n103\n\n104\n\n5\n\n8\n\n100\n\n101\n\nk\n(b)\n\n102\n\n103\n\n6\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\nk\n(c)\n\nFigure 5: The reference network preserving P (k) and \u03c6(k) for (a) the Internet, (b) the Protein\nand (c) the Collaborations\u2013A networks. Nearest-neighbours average degree knn (k) of the original\nnetwork is in green and that of the reference networks is in blue. For each network, 103 reference\nnetworks are generated and averaged. The error bars give the standard deviation for each value.\n\n5.1\n\nCorrelation profile between rich nodes\n\nThe above ensemble of reference networks allows us to assess the correlation between rich nodes in\na network in relative to the randomised version of the network having similar network structure.\nThe correlation measures how important a connection between two rich nodes is in terms of the\norganisation of the rich\u2013club and the global structure.\nConsider aij as the ij-th entry of the adjacency matrix describing the original network, and\na0ij (m) is the ij-th entry of the adjacency matrix of the m-th reference network obtained by the\nabove randomisation process, where M is the total number of the reference networks. The frequency\nprobability that there is a connection between nodes i and j in the M reference networks is\nM\n1 X 0\nqij =\naij (m).\nM\n\n(12)\n\nm=1\n\nThe correlation profile is obtained by evaluating bij = aij \u2212 qij . The case bij = 0 happens if the\nconnectivity of the original network and the reference networks is the same. This case could happen\nif (1) the original network and the reference networks never have a link between nodes i and j;\nor (2) the original network and the reference networks always have a link between nodes i and j.\nThe case bij = 1 means the original network has a link between nodes i and j but this link never\nappears in the reference networks. The case bij = \u22121 means that in the original network there is\nnot a link between nodes i and j but this link always appears in the reference networks.\nFigure 6 shows the correlation between the rich nodes in three real networks. The nodes are\nlabelled by their rank. As the case bij = 0 can represent two different situations we label the profile\nusing two colour codes. The blue and white squares (bij = 0) are the links that define the backbone\nof the network. The existence, or not, of these links is fundamental for the network structure and\nperhaps network functionality [5].\n11\n\n\f20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\nInternet\n\n1\n20\n\n1\n\n10\n\nProtein\n\n20\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-1.0\n\nCollaborations\n\nFigure 6:\nCorrelation profiles for the top 20 richest nodes for the Internet, Protein and\nCollaborations\u2013A networks. For each network, the profile is obtained from 103 reference networks\npreserving P (k) and \u03c6(k). The colour codes are: from blue to red (b = 0 \u2192 b = 1) labels the\nchance that a link exist in the original network but not in the reference networks; from white to\ngreen (b = 0 \u2192 b = \u22121) labels the chance that a link does not exist in the original network but\nexist in the reference networks.\nIn the Internet profile, the 7 richest nodes are always fully interconnected with each other in\nthe original network and in each of the reference networks (blue). Such a rich\u2013club clique is an\nimportant structure for the Internet because it provides a large number of shortcuts for the delivery\nof data traffic and makes the average shortest path between any two nodes as small as just over\n3 hops4 . We conjecture that the existence of such the rich\u2013club clique is a fundamental property\nif the ensemble represents networks that deliver traffic efficiently. Another interesting behaviour\nin the Internet's correlation profile is that there is a link between nodes with ranks 15 and 17\nthat is present in the original data but appears very rarely in its randomised version (bright red\nsquare). Whether this reflects erroneous or incomplete measurements, or for some reason these\nnodes interact with each other against the odds, makes this interaction of particular interest.\nThe profile of the Protein network shows a completely different behaviour. The rich nodes in\nthe ensemble tend not to connect with each other. The white vertical and horizontal bands show\nthere are interactions between proteins that never occur in the original network or the reference\nnetworks. To decide if this structure is reflecting impossible protein interactions will require a more\nspecific analysis.\nThe profile of the Collaborations\u2013A network shows that some researchers tend to always collaborate with each other (blue) and others never collaborate (white), possibly reflecting the friendship\nand rivalries between researchers. What is never present is a collaboration between two researchers\nthat it should not happen (no red squares in the profile), i.e. hindsight cannot be detected via the\nreference networks.\n4\n\nThe AS-Internet contains more than 9 thousand nodes\n\n12\n\n\f6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe rich nodes of a network tend to dominate the organisation of network structure so it is relevant\nto understand if their interconnectivity is due to chance or to an organisational principle. A\ntechnique to analyse this issue is to compare the rich\u2013club coefficient against the equivalent structure\nevaluated from an ensemble of reference networks. The ensemble is generated via the restricted\nrandomisation of the original network.\nWe evaluate a recently proposed null model which is based on the ensemble of maximal random\nnetworks conserving the degree distribution of the original network. We remark that one should\nnot confuse the rich-club structure of a network with the rich-club ordering detected by the null\nmodel.\nWe presented a method to generate, from an assortative network, an ensemble of assortative\nreference network with the condition that the rich-club coefficient \u03a6(r) is conserved. The assortative\nreference network could be used for detecting the community structure of social networks which are\ninherently assortative. The assortative reference networks also provides a different way to explain\nthe evolution of social collaborations.\nWe also presented a method to generate reference networks which preserve both the degree\ndistribution and the rich-club coefficient \u03c6(k). The ensemble of such reference networks have a\nsimilar structure as the original network. We use them to study the correlations between the rich\nnodes and pinpoint which connections between them form the backbone of the network.\nFinally we'd like to remark that in the all cases of ensembles, the reference networks are generated from the original network. Properties of the ensemble strongly depend on the properties of\nthe original network. Any deduction based on these ensembles should take into consideration this\ndependance.\n\nAcknowledgments\nRJM would like to thank the EPSRC UK (EP/C520246/1) for support.
