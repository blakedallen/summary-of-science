The second paper addresses the general issue\nof compass and straightedge constructions using Gauss\u201fs Disquisitiones\nArithmeticae of 1801.\n\n\fPart I - D\u00fcrer's life\nAlbrecht D\u00fcrer was born in Nuremberg (N\u00fcrnberg) in 1471. Nuremberg lies on the Pegnitz River\nand is surrounded by the farmlands and woods of Bavaria. Medieval Germany was part of the\nHoly Roman Empire and when Frederick III died in 1493, his son Maximillian I became ruler of\nthe Roman Empire and Germany. Nuremberg was an important city in this empire because it lay\non the trade routes between southern and northern Europe. Under Maximillian I, Nuremberg was\nregarded as the \u201eunofficial capitol\u201f of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe walkway street market in Nuremberg by Albrecht D\u00fcrer\n\nView of Nuremberg from the West by Albrecht D\u00fcrer\n\nNuremberg was famous for craftsmen who produced weapons, nautical instruments, jewelry,\nwoodcuts and engravings. In 1450, in nearby Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg introduced a printing\npress using movable type and book printing soon became a thriving industry in Nuremberg. The\nprinting press and the town of Nuremberg played a major part in the Reformation movement in\nGermany.\nD\u00fcrer\u201fs father came to Nuremberg from his native Hungary in1455. He worked as a goldsmith in\nthe shop of Hieronymus Holper and 12 years later married Holper\u201fs daughter. Albrecht was the\nthird child of this marriage and within 20 years he had a total of 17 siblings \u2013 only three of which\nsurvived childhood. (Nuremberg suffered a number of plagues in the 15th and 16th centuries.)\n\n\fAccording to Albrecht\u201fs book of family matters, his father had been trained in the Netherlands\n\"with the great Masters\". The Elder D\u00fcrer was industrious but not particularly prosperous.\nFollowing tradition, Albrecht became an apprentice to his father and learned the skills of a\ngoldsmith. In medieval Germany, goldsmiths were closely aligned with engravers because the\nskills were very similar. In the words of Edwin Panofsky \" the greatest engravers of the 15th\ncentury were originally not painters or book illuminators, but goldsmiths...\"\nIt soon became clear that Albrecht had natural talent for drawing. Below is a self-portrait, done\nin silverpoint at age 13. A year later he became an apprentice to one of the most famous artists\nand printmakers in Nuremberg, Michael Wolgemut.\n\nUpon completing his apprenticeship at age 19, D\u00fcrer following the tradition of young artists and\ntraveled throughout Germany to study the work of master artists and printmakers. He traveled to\nColmar and later Basel which was a center for bookmaking. D\u00fcrer\u201fs godfather was a prosperous\npublisher and the young D\u00fcrer already had influential connections in Basel. He did a woodcut\nportrait of St Jerome which appeared in 1492 in the Letters of St. Jerome published by Nicolaus\nKessler. Other publishers in Basel admired D\u00fcrer\u201fs work and asked him to provide woodcuts for\ntheir books. From Basel he traveled to Strassburg but he was called home by his father in 1494.\nThe Elder D\u00fcrer had arranged a marriage with Agnes Fry and the dowry would soon enable him\nto open his own shop.\nAfter getting married in the summer of 1494, D\u00fcrer set off to Italy where his life-long friend\nWillibald Pirckheimer was studying in Padua. The warmth of Italy was a respite from the plague\nthat had broken out in Nuremberg. D\u00fcrer witnessed the art of the Italian Renaissance and\nmarveled at the level of respect showed toward artists. In his native Germany there were no\n\u201eartists\u201f \u2013 only craftsmen. D\u00fcrer was determined that Germany would participate in the regrowth\nof science and the arts that he was witnessing in Italy.\n\n\fThe Renaissance was accompanied by newfound respect for geometry, mathematics and the\nsciences. In Venice, D\u00fcrer found artists such as Luca Pacioli who would publish The Divine\nProportion in 1509 with drawings by Leonardo da Vinci (1452- 1519). D\u00fcrer was not highly\neducated but he was familiar with the works of Euclid (c.300 BC) and Ptolemy (AD 90 \u2013 AD\n168) and on a later trip to Venice, D\u00fcrer bought a copy of Euclid for his library. Throughout his\nlife, D\u00fcrer exchanged views on art and science with Pirckheimer and other Nuremberg scholars\nsuch as the mathematician Johannes Werner.\nWhen D\u00fcrer returned to Nuremberg in 1495 he opened his own shop and soon became one of the\nmost respected printmakers in Germany. He was an accomplished painter but his true passion\nwas printmaking. The prints could be sold at a price which was affordable by the common\nperson and D\u00fcrer made every effort to produce prints which were interesting and enlightening.\nBelow is a watercolor of the courtyard of the former castle in Innsbruck, and on the right is a\nwoodcut of three peasants in conversation.\n\nIn 1505 D\u00fcrer made another trip to Italy. In general, the Italians regarded the Germans as poorly\neducated brutes, but they had a great respect for D\u00fcrer as an artist and a man. He became a close\nfriend of Giovanni Bellini whom D\u00fcrer described as \"the best painter in Venice\". D\u00fcrer was\nbecoming one of the most influential artists in Northern Europe. When he returned to Germany,\nthe Emperor Maximillian I, honored him with commissions and later gave him a pension. In\n1519 D\u00fcrer painted a portrait of Maximillian holding a pomegranate which was his personal\nsymbol.\n\n\fWhen Maximillian was succeeded by his grandson Charles V, D\u00fcrer traveled to the Netherlands\nto meet with Charles. He was honored throughout his trip, but an excursion to Zeeland in 1520 to\nview a beached whale, apparently led to a bout with malaria which contributed to his demise in\n1528 at age 57. D\u00fcrer left behind a considerable estate and a legacy of more than a thousand\ndrawings, hundreds of engravings and dry points, and about seventy paintings. He also wrote and\nillustrated books on geometry, city fortification, and human proportion.\nIn keeping with the tradition of the early Renaissance period , most of D\u00fcrer\u201fs work was\nreligious in nature, but he also produced some notable secular works such as the famous\nMelancholia I copperplate engraving from 1514 (see below). This is a study in perspective and\ngeometry which also contains a number of mathematical references such as the \u201emagic\u201f square in\nthe upper right corner. This square sums to 34 in rows, columns and diagonals. Note that the\nbottom row contains 15 and 14 which is the date of the engraving, and the numbers 4 and 1 may\nrepresent D and A - D\u00fcrer\u201fs monogram. In addition, pairs of numbers symmetrical to the center\nsum to 17. This magic square may have originated with Cornelius Agrippa\u201fs De Occulta\nPhilosophia.\n\nThere is a strange polyhedron which appears to be a truncated rhomboid. It may have started out\nas a cube which was stretched and then truncated. Mathematica has a data-base of polyhedra\nwhich includes DuerersSolid (this is the accepted spelling when the \u00fc is not desirable) - type,\nPolyhedronData[\"DuerersSolid\"]. The skeleton of D\u00fcrer\u201fs solid is a generalized Peterson\ngraph. There is still doubt as to the actual geometry of the polyhedron and its meaning. D\u00fcrer\ndeveloped innovative methods for constructing polyhedra using \u201enets\u201f and it is possible that the\nnet for this polyhedron is related to the magic square.\n\n\fIn the lower left part of the engraving there are tools such as compass, scale and hourglass. These\ntools lay unused on the ground and there is endless speculation about the meaning of this. D\u00fcrer\nappears to have suffered from early bouts of arthritis and after visiting the Netherlands in 1521,\nhe may have also suffered from malaria. In addition, his arranged marriage had been a\ndisappointment and he had no children.\nLate in his life, D\u00fcrer embarked on an ambitious project to convey to other artists and craftsmen\nthe theoretical skills of their craft. D\u00fcrer felt that his fellow German artists were equal to all\nothers in practical skill and power of imagination, but they were inferior to the Italians in rational\nknowledge. In keeping with the spirit of the Renaissance D\u00fcrer felt that \"geometry is the right\nfoundation of all painting\". But D\u00fcrer was also a practical man and he later wrote: \"As for\ngeometry it may prove the truth of some things; but with respect to others we must resign\nourselves to the opinion and judgment of men.\"\nD\u00fcrer finished just the first stages of his project: The Four Books of Measurement with Compass\nand Ruler (Underweysung der Messung mit dem Zirckel und Richtscheyt) which was published in\n1525 and the Four Books of Human Proportion (Vier Buchen von Manschlicher Proportion)\nwhich was published in 1528 just after his death.\n\nThese books were written in German instead of the traditional Latin, so they were accessible to\ncraftsmen, including printmakers, painters, goldsmiths, sculptors, and stonemasons. To do this\nD\u00fcrer often had to invent a vocabulary for some technical phrases which only existed in Latin.\n(As late as the 19th century, German mathematicians such as Carl Friedrich Gauss still wrote in\nLatin.)\nThe Books of Measurement were a textbook in practical geometry so that the artist could\n\"combine practical skills with theoretical skills\". These were among the first books on geometry\nand mathematics ever written for the general public. For his sources, D\u00fcrer had a copy of Euclid,\nbut most of the material apparently came from workshops and pamphlets such as Geometrica\ndeutsch which was printed in about 1486. It was preceded by Geometria Culmensis from about\n1400. He also had access to Fialenbuchlein which was published in Nuremberg in 1486 and any\nof the books in the library of his wealthy friend Pirckheimer \u2013 who had a collection of books and\nmanuscripts on science and mathematics.\n\n\fFour Books on Measurement\nIn the introduction shown below, D\u00fcrer states that it is \"a manual of measurement of lines, areas,\nand solids by means of compass and ruler assembled by Albrecht D\u00fcrer for the use of lovers of\nart with appropriate illustrations to be printed in the year MDXXV\"\n\nThe books progress from \"Lines to Planes to Whole Bodies\". The first section covers conics, the\nspiral of Archimedes and the conchoid. The second and third sections deal with planar\nconstructions and their applications, and the fourth section deals with Platonic and Archimedean\nsolids. Below is a (rotated) fig. 17 from Book 1 showing a sinusoidal curve which D\u00fcrer derives\nfrom 12 points on a circle. D\u00fcrer calls this spiral a \u201escrew-line\u201f. It was apparently used by\nstonemasons. The text below says \"This is the spiral and its ground plan as described above\".\n\n\fPart II \u2013 The polygon constructions from the second book of measurement\nThe second book contains illustrations and directions for the construction of geometrical objects\nsuch as \u201eregular\u201f polygons with compass and (unmarked) straightedge. D\u00fcrer was very modest\nand never claimed that his constructions were new or unique \u2013 although some appear to be\nunique. Most of the exact constructions were passed down from Euclid and the approximate\nconstructions were typically those used in the workshops of engravers, cabinetmakers or masons.\n\nCompass and straightedge constructions data back to Euclid of Alexandria who was born in\nabout 300 B.C. In terms of regular polygons, the Greeks could construct polygons with 2k sides\nfor k >1. They could also construct the regular triangle and the regular pentagon but these were\nthe only \u201eprime \u201epolygons that they could construct. They knew that the construction of a regular\nn-gon could be combined with the construction of a regular m-gon to yield a regular nm-gon\nwhen n and m were relatively prime. D\u00fcrer shows how to construct a 15-gon using a triangle and\npentagon.\nRegular polygons had been used throughout the Middle Ages in architecture and decoration as\nwell as in the design of cities and fortifications. D\u00fcrer knew that there were a limited number of\n\u201eexact\u201f constructions and in the case of the pentagon he gives both an exact and an approximate\nconstruction. The approximate construction, based on a single compass setting, may be due to\nPappus of Alexandria (c. 290 \u2013 350 A.D.). D\u00fcrer preferred such constructions when possible. It\nyields an equilateral pentagon which D\u00fcrer apparently thought was also equiangular.\nIn the Second Book, D\u00fcrer covers all the \u201eregular\u201f polygons from the triangle to the 16-gon. (He\nleaves it to the reader to get the dodecagon by bisecting the arcs of the hexagon.) D\u00fcrer also\nmentions how to construct the 28-gon. He was probably aware that the St. Lorenz church in\nNuremberg had a beautiful rosette window with stonework based on a regular 28-gon. This\nwindow was apparently constructed in about 1470. The church and window are shown below.\nNote the transition from an inner octagon to the outer 28-gon.\n\n\fBelow is a list of the polygon constructions in the order they are given in the Second Book.\nNumber of\nsides\n6\n\nD\u00fcrer\u201fs\nfigure\n9\n\nRegular\n(Y/N)\nY\n\n3\n\n10\n\nY\n\n7\n\n11\n\nN\n\n14 & 28\n\n12\n\nN\n\n4\n\n13\n\nY\n\n8 & 16\n\n14\n\nY\n\n5 & 10\n\n15\n\nY\n\n5\n\n16\n\nN\n\n15\n\n17\n\nN\n\n9\n\n18\n\nN\n\n11 & 13\n\n19\n\nN\n\nThumbnail of figures\n\n\fFor each construction we will give D\u00fcrer\u201fs original 1525 text and figures along with a\ntranslation. A photocopy of the original book is available on-line at the Saxon State library in\nDresden. The most notable mathematical studies were by H. Steigmuller in 1891 and Max Steck\nin 1948. The definitive 1943 study by Edwin Panofsky focuses mainly on his art. In 1977, W.L.\nStrauss published a copy of the Four Books with a side-by-side English translation and some\nanalysis based on Steigmuller. More recent analysis and partial translations have been published\nby Donald Crowe and Dan Pedoe.\nA copy of the 1525 text is also available at wikisource and Google will attempt a translation, but\nthe resulting translation of D\u00fcrer\u201fs medieval German to English is almost comical. The passages\nneeded here are relatively short and the accompanying diagrams make translations fairly routine,\nbut there are places where D\u00fcrer\u201fs text and his diagrams seem to be at odds. In these cases we\nwill present views and opinions from as many sources as possible.\nAfter presenting the text and translations, we will carry out the non-regular constructions with\nMathematica and in a related paper, we will perform an analysis of these non-regular cases using\nthe Tangent map (outer billiards map). We encourage the reader to download the Mathematica\ncode from DynamicsOfPolygons.org and perform their own analysis.\nBelow is a page from the original manuscript showing figures 9,10,11 and 12. D\u00fcrer presented\nthe polygons in logical order \u2013 starting with the hexagon and using the odd vertices to get a\nregular triangle and then bisecting a side of this triangle to construct the heptagon and finally\nbisecting the arcs of the heptagon to get the 14-gon.\n\n\fFor the most part D\u00fcrer knew which constructions were approximate and which were exact, but\nhe was more concerned with the practical aspects of the constructions. Whenever possible he\ngave constructions which used a fixed compass setting. Interest in such \u201erusty compass\u201f\nconstructions was fueled by the popularity of his work, but it was later shown that any\nconstruction with variable compass can also be carried out with fixed compass. Some of the early\ncompasses did not even have a hinge but it is still possible to transcribe a given circle at another\nlocation, just as if there was a hinge.\nApproximate constructions were considered to be \u201emechanical\u201f and not demonstrative. D\u00fcrer\nnoted that 7, 11 and 13 were in this category. He does not state explicitly that the 9-gon\nconstruction is mechanical but it is based on \u201eworkshop\u201f methods which were well known to be\napproximate. We remarked earlier that D\u00fcrer did not state that the fixed compass pentagon\nconstruction was approximate.\n\uf077The Regular Hexagon \u2013 Fig. 9\n\n\"Now I will explain how to construct figures with an even and uneven number of corners, that is three,\nfour, five and six-cornered figures, etc. First I shall construct a figure with six corners because it can be\nmade without changing the opening of the compass. Take a compass and place one leg on center point a\nand with the other side draw a circle of the desired size, large or small. Then move the compass without\nchanging its opening, to the periphery of the circle, and mark off this distance on it. Then continue along\nthe periphery in the same manner. You will then obtain six points which you will mark with numerals\n1,2,3,etc. Connect points 1 and 2, points 2 and 3, points 3 and 4,etc. with straight lines. You will obtain a\nsix-cornered figure. Therefore the line from the center a to the periphery is one-sixth, and also each line\nbetween the numerals is one-sixth.\"\n\n\f\uf077 The Regular Triangle \u2013 fig. 10\n\n\"Now I will use this six-cornered figure to construct a triangle within a circle. I use the six points of the\npreceding figure, but connect points 1 and 3, points 3 and 5, and points 5 and 1 with straight lines. This\nwill result in a triangle that touches the periphery and is symmetrical in every respect and position, as\nshown in the diagram.\"\n\nComment: D\u00fcrer combined the triangle and heptagon constructions in fig. 10 and showed the\nresults of the heptagon construction in fig. 11 below.\n\uf077 The Regular Heptagon (approximate)- fig. 11\n\n\"Now I shall show a simple way of using the triangle of the preceding figure to construct a sevencornered figure. I draw a straight line from the center point a to point 2 which cuts the side 1,3 of the\ntriangle in half. Where this occurs I mark b. The length 1b will then fit seven times around the periphery,\nas shown in the figure.\"\n\nComment: It had usually been assumed that D\u00fcrer obtained this construction from the pamphlet\nGeometria deutsch but Donald Crowe points out that the construction there is different and does\nnot conform to the strict compass and straightedge criteria, so this construction may be D\u00fcrer\u201fs\nown. Indeed Kepler refers to this as \u201eD\u00fcrer\u201fs Rule\u201f. But according to J. Tropfke this\nconstruction has a long history and was known to Heron of Alexandria.\n\n\f\uf077 The Regular 14-gon (approximate)- fig. 12\n\n\"Next I will show how to construct a figure with fourteen sides from only seven sides. By means of a\ncircle, divide one of the sides in half. Then mark off this length along the periphery. You will have\nfourteen points which when connected will form a figure with fourteen corners as shown in the diagram.\nOne can use the same method to construct a figure with twenty-eight sides or twice as many.\"\n\nComment: There has been some contention among translators about D\u00fcrer\u201fs meaning when he\nsays to \"mark off this length along the periphery\". There is little doubt that D\u00fcrer intended for\nthe reader to use the bisected arc rather than the bisected side. He certainly knew the difference\nand the diagram seems to make this clear. The procedure for bisecting a cord and an arc are the\nsame. It\u201fs just a matter of what point you chose after drawing the two \u201evesica pices\u201f arcs as\nshown above. It is natural to choose the point that is already on the original arc, and that is\nclearly what Durer did here. The only exception is in figures 10 and 11 where Durer deliberately\nchose the length rather than the arc, so that the resulting figure has 7 sides instead of 6.\nIn the next two constructions D\u00fcrer leaves no doubt that to double the number of sides, arcs must\nbe bisected. Both H. Steigmuller and W.L. Strauss seemed to be of the opinion that D\u00fcrer meant\nfor the reader to use the given length, but Strauss was not a mathematician and his analysis was\ntypically based on that of Steigmuller. Donald Crowe remarks that Steigmuller apparently did\nnot have his own copy of the manuscript so he had to rely more on the text (which he could copy\nfrom the library ) rather than the diagrams. D\u00fcrer of course assumed that the reader has the\ndiagram as well as the text and is using common sense. As we will see with the 13-gon, D\u00fcrer\nsometimes assumes that the diagrams can speak for themselves.\n\n\f\uf077The Regular Quadrilateral \u2013 fig. 13\n\n\"Now I will construct a quadrangle with a compass. First draw a circle. Through its center a draw a\nhorizontal line. Where this line crosses the periphery I mark the points b and c. Then I draw a vertical\nline from center a up and down to the periphery, at right angles to the horizontal line, and I mark the\npoint where it crosses the periphery. On top I mark d and on the bottom e. Then I connect points b and d,\nd and c, c and e and c and b by straight lines. They will form a square symmetric with the circle, as\nshown in the diagram below.\"\n\uf077The Regular Octagon \u2013 fig. 14\n\n\f\"Now it is proper to show how to construct an eight-cornered figure. Using the preceding figure, retain\nthe side bd and divide the arc above it into two halves. Mark the midpoint f. Then connect f and d and it\nwill give you one side of the eight cornered figure. To obtain a sixteen cornered figure, divide the arc fd\ninto two halves and mark the midpoint g. The line connecting g and d will represent one side of the\nsixteen sided figure. This is demonstrated in the three figures below.\"\n\uf077The Regular Pentagon- fig. 15\n\n\"Now it is necessary to construct a pentagon within a circle. To do this, first draw a circle with center a\nand draw a horizontal line through this center. Where this horizontal line crosses the periphery of the\ncircle mark points b and c. Then draw a vertical line through the center a at right angles to the horizontal\nline. Where it crosses the periphery at top mar the point d. Now draw a straight line ed and place one leg\nof a compass on e and the other on d and draw an arc down to the horizontal line bc. Where the arc\ncrosses the line mark point f. Then connect f and d. The line fd represents one edge of the pentagon,\nwhereas line fa is equal to one side of a ten-sided figure. Then divide line ac into two halves and erect a\nvertical line up to the periphery. Its length is equal to approximately one-seventh of the circle. This is\nshown in the following diagram.\"\n\nComment: This is an old construction credited to Caludius Ptolemy (c.80-198). In the first of\nthese three figures the \u201e5\u201f, \u201e10\u201f and \u201e7\u201f show that this one diagram contains an (exact) side of a\npentagon and decagon and an (approximate) side of a heptagon. The heptagon side given here is\njust as in D\u00fcrer\u201fs method, and he notes that it is approximate.\n\u221a\n\n\fD\u00fcrer of course intended that the point e is the bisector line ac. There is much speculation as to\nwhy D\u00fcrer chose this construction rather than Euclid\u201fs construction which uses the \u201egolden-ratio\u201f\nproportion. The speculation stems from the fact that D\u00fcrer makes no mention of the golden ratio,\nalthough he was no doubt aware of its use in Italian art. It may be that D\u00fcrer simply did not feel\ncomfortable with the precepts of the \u201edivine\u201f ratio. The German architects had their own \u201edivine\u201f\nratio which was the vesica pices ratio of \u221a (more on this below). In addition Ptolemy\u201fs\nconstruction is simpler than Euclid\u201fs and these constructions were just a preliminary step in his\nprogram.\n\uf077The Regular Pentagon (approximate)- fig. 16\n\n\"Construction of a pentagon without changing the opening of the compass is accomplished as follows.\nDraw two circles which overlap so that the periphery of each touches the other's center. Then connect the\ntwo center points a and b with a straight line. The length of this line is equal to one side of the pentagon.\nWhere the two circles cross mark c at top and d at the bottom and draw the line cd. Then take the\ncompass without changing the opening and place one leg on d and with the other draw an arc through the\ntwo circles and their centers a and b. And where the periphery is crossed by this arc mark points e and f.\nWhere the vertical line cd is crossed mark the point g. Then draw a line eg and extend it to the periphery\nof the circle. Mark that point i. Then connect i with a and h with b and it will give you three sides of the\npentagon. Then erect two inclined lines of equal length from i and h until they meet at top. You will have\npentagon as I have drawn here.\"\n\n\fComment: Points c through i are not labeled in D\u00fcrer\u201fs diagram so we have included a diagram\non the right above showing the locations of these points. This construction and diagram are taken\ndirectly from Geometria Deutsch, but in that pamphlet the reader is told in the last step to draw a\ncircle at h and take k to be the point where this circle intersects the line of symmetry cd. D\u00fcrer\napparently felt the need to instead draw two symmetric circles at h and i. These last two circles\nare not drawn above.\nThis fixed compass construction yields an equilateral pentagon which is not equiangular. D\u00fcrer\ndid not state that it was approximate and he may have believed that the angles were equal. This\nconstruction apparently dates back to Pappas of Alexandria. Because D\u00fcrer\u201fs works were widely\ndistributed, many of the constructions are credited to him and Donald Crowe points out that P.\nCataldi in 1620 derived extensive equations to show that \u201eD\u00fcrer\u201fs pentagon\u201f is not regular.\n\uf077The Regular 15-gon (approximate or exact depending on which pentagon is used)- fig. 17\n\n\"By using the construction of a triangle, as outlined above, it is possible to convert this pentagon into a\n15-sided figure. First draw a circle with center a. then draw one side of a the triangle, marked b at top\nand c at bottom. Then take the length of one side of the pentagon and place one end of it on point b and\nthe other on the periphery of the circle. Where it touches the periphery mark the point d. Divide the\nremaining distance between d and c be means of a compass into two halves and mark the midpoint e. If\nyou then connect points e and c, it will give you the length of one side of the fifteen-sided figure, as shown\nin the following diagram.\"\n\nComment: This construction was described in Euclid. Note that if the second edge of the\npentagon is drawn, then the arc bisection can be avoided, but neither Euclid nor D\u00fcrer do this.\n\n\f\uf077The Regular 9-gon (approximate)- fig. 18\n\n\"You can construct a nine-sided figure based on a triangle. Draw a large circle with center a. Then\nwithout changing the opening of the compass draw three \u201efish bladders\u201f whose upper end on the\nperiphery you will mark b. Mark the other c and d. Within the upper fish bladder draw a vertical line ba\nand divide this line with two points 1 and 2 into three equal parts. Point 2 should be closest to a. Then\ndraw a horizontal line through point 2 at right angles to the vertical line ba. Where the horizontal line\ncrosses the fish bladder mark points e and f. Then place one leg of the compass on center a and the other\non point e and draw a circle through f. Line ef will then represent one of nine sides which will compose a\nnonagon inside this smaller circle, as shown in the diagram below.\"\n\n\fComment: D\u00fcrer\u201fs fischblosen (fish bladders) are known in Latin as vesica pices and in Italian\nas mandorla (almonds). They occur quite naturally when bisecting a given length or arc with a\ncompass. Vesica pices have appeared in art and architecture dating back to early Egypt. D\u00fcrer\nwas familiar with the work of the Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius (c. 80 BC- 15 BC) who\nformulated a science of proportion based on geometric form and symmetry in the spirit of\nPythagoras. Vitruvius compiled a set of Ten Books on Architecture and he also studied human\nproportion. The ratio of the length to width of the vesica pices is \u221a and this proportion was\ncommon in medieval and Gothic architecture. In Cesar Casariano\u201fs Vitruvius of 1521 he calls\nthis the \u201erule of the German architects\u201f.\nIn D\u00fcrer\u201fs unpublished notebooks at the British Museum there are drawings which suggest that\nhe did not simply reproduce the given ef interval around the inner circle, but instead he used all\nthree fish bladders and obtained the remaining vertices by bisection. See the details below in the\nanalysis section.\nD\u00fcrer did not state explicitly that this construction is approximate, but most likely he knew it\nwas not \u201edemonstrative\u201f. Edwin Panofsy notes that \" ..his approximate construction of the\nenneagon is not described in any written source but was taken over directly, as we happen to\nknow, from the tradition of the \u201eordinary workmen\u201f \"\n\uf077The Regular 11-gon and 13-gon (both approximate) \u2013 fig. 19\n\n\f\"To construct an eleven-sided figure by means of a compass, I take a quarter of a circle's diameter,\nextend it by one-eighth of its length and use this for construction of the eleven-sided figure.This is a\nmechanical not a demonstrative construction.\"\n\"If a thirteen-sided figure is required, I first draw a circle with center a. Then I draw the radius ab and\ncut it in half at d. I use the length cd to mark off thirteen pieces along the periphery of the circle. But this\nmethod is mechanical and not demonstrative.\"\n\nComment: D\u00fcrer only devoted a few sentences to both of these but the resulting constructions\nare surprisingly accurate. There is no known historical precedent for either, and they may be\nunique to D\u00fcrer. The 11-gon construction is more accurate than the traditional method which is\nbased on \u201eRenaldini\u201fs Rule\u201f.\nBoth Steigmuller and Strauss seemed to be confused by D\u00fcrer\u201fs intentions for the 13-gon and\nthey omitted any reference to the \u201elength cd\u201f. D\u00fcrer clearly states to use 'leng .cd' but both\nSteigmuller and Strauss say \"use this length\" which of course implies that the reader should\nsimply cut ab in half and use that length. Stegimuller knew that this would create a large error\nand he remarked \"Even in D\u00fcrer\u201fs figure the mistake is disturbingly apparent at first glance.\"\nStrauss repeats this opinion when he discusses Steigmuller\u201fs analysis: \"... for the regular\nthirteen sided polygon the equivalents are: actual .478635; D\u00fcrer .5 but this difference makes\nthe method imperfect as can be seen even in D\u00fcrer\u201fs figure.\"\nIn fact the picture is very accurate and Strauss was just repeating the opinion of Steigmuller.\nIndeed if the side was .5, the figure would look very weird because the 13th side would be about\n.2184. This is clearly not what D\u00fcrer intended or what is drawn above. There is no doubt that bd\nis intended to be 1\u20442 and cd is smaller. Why else would there even be a point marked c ? We will\naddress this issue in the analysis section below.\nPart III - Analysis of the approximate constructions\n\uf077D\u00fcrer's Heptagon\n\nD\u00fcrer\u201fs construction of the heptagon has 6 equal sides but the base is slightly longer so the\nresulting polygon is not quite equilateral. This means that the corresponding 14-gon and 28-gon\nwill suffer from the same imperfections since these are obtained by bisecting the arcs of the\nheptagon. It is impossible to construct a regular heptagon with compass and ruler. For a\ndemonstration of D\u00fcrer\u201fs construction see the CDF manipulate at D\u00fcrersHeptagon. The first\nstage of the manipulate is shown below next to D\u00fcrer\u201fs drawing which instructs the user to bisect\nthe side of the equilateral triangle and use the compass to reproduce this length as an edge of the\nheptagon. Bisecting the arc rather than the side would lead back to the hexagon, so the difference\nbetween bisecting the side rather than the arc gives the heptagon.\n\n\fAssuming that the radius of the circle is 1, the sides of the equilateral triangle are each \u221a so the\nsix sides will have length \u221a\n\u2248 0.866025403784439 which is within 3 decimal places of the\nactual which is \u2248 0.8677674782351162409.

The one on the\nleft is far from regular but the one on the right is \u201ealmost\u201f regular. This is the construction used\nby D\u00fcrer. It was well-known in D\u00fcrer\u201fs time and was apparently part of Greek folklore. Both\nconstructions are based on the same principle \u2013 a chain of circles with constant radius. The\nradius determines the side of the pentagon. D\u00fcrer prefered constructions which did not involve\nchanging the compass settings and these two constructions are both in this category of \u201erusty\ncompass\u201f constructions.\nIn the example on the left, start with an arbitrary circle c1 and pick any point on c1 for the center\nof c2. Then choose an obtuse angle \u03b1 ,and continue in this fashion until one of the circles\nintersects c1. This gives a path home. A similar construction works for any number of sides. The\npentagon shown here is completely determined by the angles \u03b1 and \u03b2.\n\nThe only difference in D\u00fcrer\u201fs construction is that he provides a method for choosing a \u201egood\u201f\nangle \u03b1. (His construction yields \u03b1 \u2248 108\u00b021'58.03259 compared to the exact 108\u00b0.) As on the\nleft, start with \u201evesica pices\u201f circles centered at a and b. If a = {0,0}, and the radius is 1, then c\nand d are {1/2, \u00b1\u221a 2}. The lower circle at d determines the points e,f and g which are vertical\nand horizontal displacements of d. The lines fe and ge determine h and i. The final point k must\nlie on the extension of cd, so a circle centered at h or i will locate k.\n\n\fTo find \u03b1 = abh, note that the triangle bfg is a right triangle with base \u221a . This implies that in\nthe adjacent triangle bfh, the lower angle is 15\u00b0 and the Law of Sines gives the upper angle as \u03b8 =\nArcSin[\u221a Sin[15\u00b0]]. Therefore \u03b1 = 180\u00b0 -15\u00b0 - \u03b8 -30\u00b0 \u2248 108\u00b021'58.03259 as indicated above.\nTo find \u03b2 = bhk , use the fact that triangle hbc is isosceles: \u03b2 \u2248 107\u00b0 2'16.17332. This yields \u03b3 \u2248\n109\u00b0 11'31.58819. The coordinates of k can be found using the isosceles triangle ikh.\nThe vertices of Durer\u201fs pentagon are given below in terms of \u03b8 = ArcSin[\n\n1 3\n(\uf02d1 \uf02b 3)]\n2 2\n\n\uf070\n\uf070\n\uf070\n\uf070\na = {0,0}, b ={1,0}, h = { 1 \uf02b Cos[ \uf02b \uf071 ] , Sin[ \uf02b \uf071 ] , i = { \uf02dCos[ \uf02b \uf071 ] , Sin[ \uf02b \uf071 ] },\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n\uf070\n\n\uf070\n\nk = {1/2 , Sin[ \uf02b \uf071 ] \uf02b 1 \uf02d (Cos[ \uf02b \uf071 ] \uf02b 1/ 2) 2 }\n4\n4\nWe list the vertices below to 25 decimal places, clockwise starting with k:\nMc = {{0.5000000000000000000000000, 1.5283998042463146818570889},\n{1.31508789744914749057771507449, 0.949062493664708843813991903739},\n{1, 0}, {0, 0}, {-0.31508789744914749057771507449, 0.949062493664708843813991903739}}\n\nOur convention is to have vertex 1 at {0,1} and a radius of 1, so we will scale Mc and then\ntranslate.\ns0 = SideFromRadius[1, 5]= 1.17557050458494625833741190928 *side length for regular\npentagon with radius 1*) Ms = s0*Mc; v = {0, 1} - Ms[[1]]; tr = TranslationTransform[v];\nMc = tr[Ms] = {{0, 1},{0.958193290885377245697767, 0.318948145474695899702365},\n{0.587785252292473129168706, -0.796741729085373237430852},\n{-0.587785252292473129168706, -0.796741729085373237430852},\n{-0.958193290885377245697767, 0.318948145474695899702365}}\n\n\f\uf077D\u00fcrer's 9-gon\n\nD\u00fcrer\u201fs drawing has three small marks where the compass should be placed to get the fish\nbladders- these marks can be seen above on the outer circle at 30\u00b0, 150\u00b0 and 270\u00b0. The three fish\nbladders determine 3 of the 9 edges, and as indicated earlier, there is evidence from Durer\u201fs\nsketchbooks that he found the remaining vertices by bisecting the remaining arcs. This would\nensure symmetry and minimize the error propagation. We will do this below.\nTo find the points f and e, use the formula for the intersection of two circles of radii R and r\nassuming that the R circle is at the origin and the r circle is at {d,0} .

It is easy to prove that exact trisection of 60\u00b0 is\nnot possible with compass and straightedge, because it must be true that cos3\u03b8 = 4cos3\u03b8 \u2013 3cos\u03b8\nand when x = 2cos20\u00b0, this becomes x3 -3x-1 = 0 which is irreducible. Since cos20\u00b0 is not\nconstructible, 20\u00b0 is not constructible. See the Appendix for D\u00fcrer\u201fs approximate trisection\nmethod.

Then I draw the radius ab and\ncut it in half at d. I use the length cd to mark off thirteen pieces along the periphery of the circle. But this\nmethod is mechanical and not demonstrative.\"\nD\u00fcrer combined the 11-gon and 13-gon in Figure 19 as shown here.\n\nConcerning the 13-gon, we know that D\u00fcrer wants the reader to use the length cd which is\nslightly less than bd (which we will assume is 1\u20442) The question is, how much smaller? The\nanswer to this question seems to depend on how we interpret the symbols enlarged below. It\nlooks like a \u201e2\u201f and a small \u201e+\u201f sign but the most natural reading is the number 24. It is often the\ncase in D\u00fcrer\u201fs text that \u201e4\u201f resembles \u201e+\u201f. This is the interpretation suggested by K. Hunrath in\nhis 1905 article in Bibliotecha Mathematica. In the words of Donald Crowe \"Hunrath\u201fs reading\nis by far the most persuasive\". So Hunrath suggested that D\u00fcrer intended to decrease bd by one\nhalf of 1/24 to give an edge length of 1/2 - 1/48 = .4791 \u0305\n\nAnother possibility has to do with the 11-gon on the left where D\u00fcrer had divided the interval cb\ninto 8 equal segments and then added one of these 1/16 lengths to cb to get an edge of 9/16.\nDoing this one more time to get one half of 1/16, would give 1\u20442 - 1/32 = .46875. However the\ntable below shows that this would be inferior to the 1/24 choice.\n(i) Edge length is 1/2\n(ii)Edge length is 1/2 - 1/32 = .46875\n(iii)Edge length is 1/2 - 1/48 = .4791\u0305\nActual edge length \u2248 .4786313285751\n\n12 edges are .5 and edge 13 is about .2184\n12 edges are .46875 and edge 13 is about .59617\n12 edges are .47916 and edge 13 is about .4722\n\n\fSo 1/24 is a very good choice and shows that D\u00fcrer took great pains to find accurate results.The\nreal mystery is why D\u00fcrer was so cryptic about this construction. There are other figures which\nare missing complete descriptions so this omission is not totally unique. No changes to this text\nwere made in the 1538 edition.\nSince this construction is very accurate, it is unlikely that D\u00fcrer could test whether it was exact\nor not. This applies to the 11-gon as well. However D\u00fcrer probably had an intuition that there\nwere no \u201esimple\u201f constructions which would yield a perfect 11-gon or a perfect 13-gon and he\nlabeled both of these accordingly.\nAssuming that Durer wants the reader to reduce the half-radius db by 1/24 of db, the side length\ncd will be 23/48 with interior angle \u03b8 = 2ArcSin[23/96] \u2248 27\u00b0 43' 26.03764\u201f\u201f compared to the\nactual which is 360/13 \u2248 27\u00b0 41' 32.30769\".

The arc ab is connected by a\nstraight line and, as I explained before, I divide this line into three equal parts with points c and d. Then I\nplace one leg of the compass on a and with the other I draw an arc from c to the periphery. Where it\ncrosses the periphery I mark the point e. Then I place one leg of the compass on b and draw an arc from\nd to the periphery. Where it crosses I mark the point f. Then I erect uprights from c and d to the periphery\nand where they cross I mark points g and h. The three arcs ae, gh and bf will be equal and this leaves just\nthe two arcs eg and hf. I place one leg of the compass on a and the other on g and draw an arc down to\nab, There I mark the point i. Then I place one leg of the compass on b and draw an arc down to ab and\nmark the point k. Then I divide ci and kd into three equal parts. Now I place one leg of the compass on a\nand the other on the point next to i and draw an arc up to the periphery and mark this point l. Then I\nplace on leg of the compass on b and the other on the point next to k and again draw an arc up to the\nperiphery and mark the point m. I have thus divided the large arc into three equal parts at points l and m\nas shown in the diagram. Whoever wants it more exact is welcome to look for a proof.\"\n\n\fD\u00fcrer knew that Euclid did not describe any method for trisecting an angle so he was aware that\nthere was no known procedure that would give exact results. This probably led him to believe\nthat his construction is not exact, but he did not venture an opinion in the text - except for his\n\u201edisclaimer\u201f in the last sentence. For some reason this last sentence was omitted by Strauss who\ndid remark that the method was approximate \u2013 yet highly accurate.\nThis construction appears to be unique to D\u00fcrer, who may have felt that there should be a\nconnection between trisecting a cord and trisecting an angle. For small angles they are almost the\nsame. The Greeks were adept at trisecting lengths and typically it takes 2 circles and 4 lines.\nWhat makes this angle trisection scheme so clever is that D\u00fcrer does it recursively with two\nsuccessive trisections of intervals. This yield a \u201esecond\u201f order\u201f correction to the first trisection.\nThe end result is a very accurate trisection \u2013 even for larger angles.\nExample: It is only necessary to do one of the two trisections. Below is a diagram showing the\nminimum steps needed to carry out D\u00fcrer\u201fs trisection of the angle AOB. (In this example AOB is\n100\u00b0). The labeling here is the same as D\u00fcrer\u201fs, where we use the point X for the \u201epoint to the\nright of k\". This is the final point in the construction. D\u00fcrer extends this point up to the arc at m\nbut that extension is not necessary if we only want to trisect the angle.\n\nStep 1: Trisect the length AB to obtain the point D\nStep 2: Construct a perpendicular at D which meets the arc at H\nStep 3: Place the point of the compass on B and draw an arc from H to obtain the point K\nStep 4: Trisect the length KD to get X\n\n\fTo do this with Mathematica, the only non-trivial step is finding H. Here are the calculations:\n(*Points A and B*) p1 = {Cos[20 Degree], Sin[20 Degree]}; p2 = {Cos[120 Degree], Sin[120 Degree]};\np3 = {0,0}; slope1 = (p1[[2]] - p2[[2]])/(p1[[1]] - p2[[1]]); d1 = EuclideanDistance[p1, p2]\nDeltaxy[d_, slope_] := {d*Cos[ArcTan[slope]], d*Sin[ArcTan[slope]]}; (*to extend along a line*)\np4 = p1 - Deltaxy[d1/3, slope1]; (*p4 is the point D*)\nslope2 = -1/slope1; p5 = p4 + Deltaxy[.25, slope2]; (*p5 is an arbitrary point on DH*)\n(*To find the point H, use p4 and p5*): x1 = p4[[1]]; y1 = p4[[2]]; x2 = p5[[1]]; y2 = p5[[2]];\ndx = x2 - x1; dy = y2 - y1; dr = Sqrt[dx^2 + dy^2] ; D = x1*y2 - x2*y1; Del = Sqrt[dr^2 - D^2];\nH1 = (D*dy + Sign[dy]*dx*Del)/dr^2; H2= (-D*dx + Abs[dy]*Del)/dr^2;\nH = {H1,H2} \u2248 { .5712240, .820794} (*this is one of two solutions \u2013 at top and at bottom*)\n(*Now find K and X*) d2= EuclideanDistance[p1,H]; K = p1 - Deltaxy[d2, slope1];\nd3 = EuclideanDistance[K, p4]; X = K + Deltaxy[d3/3, slope1] \u2248 {0.4012520632830577,\n0.5379964791784059}\n\nm1 = (p1[[2]] - p3[[2]])/(p1[[1]] - p3[[1]]); m2 = (X[[2]] - p3[[2]])/(X[[1]] - p3[[1]]);\n\u03b8 = N[ArcTan[(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)]] \u2248 0.5809057243292304 \u2248 33\u00b0 17' 0.40668\"\nCompare to the actual which is DMSString[100/3] = 33\u00b0 20' 0\"\n\nFor smaller angles, this method is so accurate that the secondary trisection can often be omitted\nand K can be used instead of X. Clearly K and H approach each other as the angle decreases.\nExample 2: If D\u00fcrer had tested his method with the well-known angle of 60\u00b0 it would have been\nimpossible for him to discern any error as the following calculations show.\np1 = {1,0}; p2= {Cos[60 Degree], Sin[60 Degree]}; H \u2248 {0.9372458971632998, 0.3486690812942283}\nX \u2248 {0.8263539868031372, 0.3007637173887421};\nHere m1 = 0 so ArcTan[m2] \u2248 0.34906100250062778410 = 19\u00b0 59' 59.00005\" Wow.\n\n\fAppendix B: Two 'modern' constructions\n\nIf D\u00fcrer had gone one more step in his program for regular polygons he would have run into the\n17-gon which was also known as the heptadecagon. Recall that the Greeks had no method for\nconstructing regular prime polygons beyond N = 5 so their list of constructible regular polygons\nwas 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, ...\nThese are all of the form: 2m3k5j where m is a nonnegative integer and j and k are either 0 or 1.\nThat was where things stood for about 2000 years, when 19-year-old Carl Friedrich Gauss\nshowed that a regular 17-gon was constructible in 1796. His solution to the cyclotomic equation\nx17 = 1 involved finding a sequence of nested quadratic equations based on the 8 pairs of\nmatching vertices. This enabled him to obtain the following form for cos(2\u03c0/17)\n2\uf070\n16cos\n\uf03d \uf02d1 \uf02b 17 \uf02b 34 \uf02d 2 17 \uf02b\n17\n\n2 17 \uf02b 3 17 \uf02d 34 \uf02d 2 17 \uf02d 2 34 \uf02b 2 17 .\nGauss showed 5 years later in Disquisitiones Arithmeticae that a prime regular polygon was\nconstructible whenever it was a of the form Fn \uf03d 22 \uf02b 1 . These are called Fermat primes and the\nn\n\nonly known cases are F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, F4 = 65537. Gauss conjectured that the\nconstructability condition was also necessary and this was proven by Pierre Wantzel in 1837.\nTherefore unless new Fermat primes are discovered (which is unlikely), there are only 5 prime\nregular polygons which can be constructed.\nA regular n-gon can be constructed with compass and straightedge iff n is the product of a\npower of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes.\nn = 2m p1p2..pk where m is a non-negative integer and each pj is either 1or the jth Fermat prime.\nThis yields the following (partial) list of constructible and non-constructible regular polygons:\nn\nConstructible ?\n\n3 4 5 6 7\nY Y Y Y N\n\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\nY N Y N Y N N Y Y Y\n\nFor more on the history of constructions, see the companion article Construction of Regular\nPolygons.pdf\n\n\fOver the years there have been many different constructions for the regular pentagon and regular\n17-gon. The constructions shown below are due to H.W. Richmond in 1893. (See Mathematical\nRecreations and Essays by W.W. Rouse Ball and H.M.S.Coxeter.) Both constructions are based\non the same principle and they are simple and elegant. The pentagon construction takes just 2\nsteps and the 17-gon construction takes 6 steps.\nFor reference we have drawn the final version of the polygons as they would appear when\ninscribed in a unit circle, with vertex 1 at {1,0}.
