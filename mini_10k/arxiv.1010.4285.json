The solid-liquid phase transition occurs at a\ngiven constant temperature, which we set at zero. The problem is described by an enthalpy\nfunction h, which represents the internal energy density in each phases (see Meirmanov\n[19] and Oleinik et al. [20]).

Then h(x, t) : \u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ) \u2192 R solves the following problem:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nht = \u2206\u03c7(h)\nin \u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nh(x, 0) = h0 (x) in \u03a9,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03c7(h) = \u03b8,\non \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T ).\n\n(ST)\n\nIn this paper we will set \u03b8(x, t) as a continuous function on \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] and h0 as a bounded\nmeasurable function with \u03c7(h0 ) continuous on \u03a9, such that \u03c7(h0 ) = \u03b8(*, 0) on \u2202\u03a9. Here\nu(x, t) := \u03c7(h)(x, t) describes the evolving temperature, where \u03c7 is defined by\n\uf8f1\nh > 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2h,\n(1.1)\n\u03c7(h) = 0,\n\u22121 \u2264 h \u2264 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nh + 1, h < \u22121.\nNote that h is determined by u almost everywhere if \u0393(u) := {u = 0} = {\u22121 \u2264 h \u2264 0}\nis of measure zero, but not in general. The interior of zero temperature set \u0393(u), if exits,\nis called a mushy region. It is well known that mushy region might appear in a Stefan\nproblem with heat sources, see Bertsch et al. [4]. When there is no heat source, the\nmushy region can only be generated from the initial data. Indeed if |{\u22121 \u2264 h0 \u2264 0}| = 0\n(here |*| denotes the Lebesgue measure in Rn ), it is shown in [21] (see also [16] and [1] ) that\n|{\u22121 \u2264 h(*, t) \u2264 0}| = 0 for all t > 0 and (ST) can be written in terms of the temperature:\n\uf8f1\nut \u2212 \u2206u = 0\nin {u > 0} \u222a {u < 0},\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\non \u0393(u) = \u2202{u > 0} = \u2202{u < 0},\n\uf8f2 Vn = |Du+ | \u2212 |Du\u2212 |\n(STu)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nu(x,\n0)\n=\nu\n(x)\n:=\n\u03c7(h\n(x))\n\uf8f4\n0\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nu=\u03b8\non \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 (0, T )\n\nHere u+ and u\u2212 denotes respectively the limit taken from {u > 0} and {u < 0}, and Vn is\nthe outward normal velocity of the free boundary with respect to {u > 0}.\n\nOn the other hand, if |{\u22121 \u2264 h0 \u2264 0}| > 0 with no heat source then the mushy region is\nnon-increasing as the solution evolves (see [21]): in this case the zero temperature set \u0393(u)\nmay exhibit instability such as infinite speed of propagation as its interior diminishes (see\n[5] where the interface evolution is investigated in the case of one-phase Hele-Shaw flow\nwith initial mushy region).\nFor both (ST) and (STu), even solutions with initially smooth configuration may develop\nsingularities in finite time, due to merging and splitting of the liquid-solid regions. Thus it\nis necessary to introduce a generalized notion of global-in-time solutions.\n2\n\n\fThe first global notion of solutions for (ST) has been derived by a weak formulation via\nintegration by parts: see Lady\u017eenskaja et. al. [18] or Friedman [15]. This approach\nallows the presence of initial mushy region. It was shown there that a unique weak solution\nexists for bounded measurable h0 and \u03b8. Moreover the temperature u(x, t) turns out to\nbe continuous when h0 and \u03b8 are sufficiently smooth \u2013 see Caffarelli & Evans [8] and\nDiBenedetto [13].\nMore recently, the notion of viscosity solutions, first introduced by Crandall & Lions\n[12], has been proved useful in the qualitative study of free boundary problems, due to\nits flexibility with nonlinear PDEs and free boundary conditions: see e.g., [2]\u2013[3] and [7]\nwhich address a general class of free boundary problems including (STu), and also see [14]\nwhere the heat operator is replaced by a class of uniformly parabolic operators. However, in\nthe two-phase case, the equivalence between viscosity solutions and weak solutions, and in\nparticular the uniqueness of the viscosity solutions of (ST), has not yet been investigated,\neven in the case of (STu). (The only notable instance is [9] where the authors show a\ncomparison principle between viscosity subsolutions and more regular supersolutions, socalled \"R-supersolutions\". Even thought their result could be used to simplify the proof of\nLemma 3.8, it is restricted to the heat operator, whereas our method is more robust and\nextends to a wider class of problems, see Remark 1.2.) In this paper we address precisely\nthis point. We introduce a notion of viscosity solutions for (ST), to derive the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 1.1. (a) There exists a viscosity solution of (ST) in Q. Furthermore, a comparison principle holds between viscosity solutions and thus maximal and minimal\nviscosity solutions exist. They respectively correspond to weak solutions of (ST) with\nmaximal and minimal initial enthalpy for given temperature u0 .\n(b) Any weak solution of (ST) in the sense of [8] is also a viscosity solution.\n(c) If |{\u22121 \u2264 h0 \u2264 0}| = 0, then there is a unique viscosity solution of (STu) which\ncoincides with the weak solution of (ST), and also coincides with the notion of viscosity\nsolutions discussed in [12] and [2].\nPreviously, one of the authors investigated in [17] viscosity solutions theory for the onephase version of (STu) (also see [10] and [6] for the case of degenerate diffusion). While\none-phase Stefan problem is a special case of the two-phase Stefan problem, this work does\nnot immediately apply to the two-phase version: we will point out the differences as we\nproceed in the proof. For example, the free boundary evolution for the two-phase setting is\nno longer monotone (that is, the positive set of u may shrink or expand over time), which\nrequires a more careful construction of test functions. Moreover, since we are allowing the\ninitial data to have mushy region, \u0393(u) may have positive measure with infinite speed of\npropagation, and thus must be treated differently. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge,\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.1 is among the first results which addresses uniqueness of viscosity solutions for\na two-phase free boundary problem.\nBelow we give an outline of the paper:\nIn sections 2 and 3 we introduce a definition of viscosity solutions for (ST), and prove that\nviscosity solutions satisfy a comparison principle for strictly separated initial data. Note\nthat this does not immediately yield uniqueness except under some geometric conditions on\nthe initial data (see Corollary 3.9), however it generates a maximal and minimal viscosity\nsolutions (see Proposition 4.4). These maximal and minimal solutions indeed correspond\nto the weak solutions with maximal and minimal initial enthalpy.\nIn section 4, we show that weak solutions are viscosity solutions. Using this result, existence\nof viscosity solutions is established. Furthermore, using the uniqueness of the weak solutions\nand barrier arguments near the parabolic boundary of Q (see Lemma 4.5), we establish the\nuniqueness of viscosity solutions when |{u0 = 0}| = 0 and \u03b8 < 0.\nRemark 1.2. The proof of the comparison principle (Theorem 3.1) relies only on the\ncomparison principle available for the parabolic operator ut \u2212 \u2206u and monotonicity of the\nboundary condition. It therefore applies to the generalized version of (STu) described in\n[2], where the second equation in (STu) is replaced by a general free boundary velocity of\nthe type\nV = G(x, |Du+ |, |Du\u2212 |, \u03b7),\nwhere \u03b7 is the spatial (outward) unit normal vector of \u0393(u), G(x, a, b, \u03b7) is continuous and\n\u2202G \u2202G\n,\u2212\n\u2265 c > 0.\n\u2202a\n\u2202b\nAnd in fact, a general uniformly parabolic operator\nut \u2212 F (t, x, u, Du, D 2 u)\ndiscussed in [11] can be considered in {u 6= 0}. That is, we require that F is an uniformly\nelliptic operator such that\n\u03bb kN k \u2264 F (t, x, v, p, M + N ) \u2212 F (t, x, v, p, M ) \u2264 \u039b kN k\nwhere t \u2208 [0, T ], x \u2208 \u03a9, v \u2208 R, p \u2208 Rn , M, N \u2208 S(n), N \u2265 0, and 0 < \u03bb \u2264 \u039b. The\nuse of Hopf 's lemma at the end of the proof of Theorem 3.1 can be omitted if we consider\nthe inf-convolution W in (3.1) on shrinking balls as in [17], which only requires a more\ndemanding notation.\nAs for existence, a slight modification of Perron's method presented in [17] combined with\nTheorem 3.1 yields the existence of a viscosity solution for the generalized version. This\napproach is not taken here since we are also interested in the coincidence of weak and\nviscosity solutions.\n4\n\n\f2\n\nThe Stefan problem\n\nLet \u2202L Q = \u2202\u03a9 \u00d7 [0, T ] be the lateral boundary of Q and \u2202P Q = (\u03a9 \u00d7 {0}) \u222a \u2202L Q be the\nparabolic boundary of Q.\nWe shall use two notions of generalized solutions for (ST): weak solutions and viscosity\nsolutions.\nDefinition 2.1. A bounded measurable function h is called the weak solution of (ST) with\ninitial data h0 \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9) and boundary data \u03b8 \u2208 L\u221e (\u2202L Q) if it satisfies (see [19])\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u03b8\n(h\u03c6t + \u03c7(h)\u2206\u03c6) dx dt \u2212\nh0 (x)\u03c6(x, 0) dx = 0\n(2.1)\nds dt +\n\u2202L Q \u2202\u03bd\nQ\n\u03a9\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 W22,1 (Q) vanishing on \u2202L Q and at t = T .\nDue to [15, 18, 19], there exists a unique weak solution h of problem (ST), defined in Definition 2.1, with initial data h0 and boundary data \u03b8. Furthermore a comparison principle\nholds between weak solutions ([19]): see the proof of Lemma 4.1 for more precise statement.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the temperature u(x, t) is related to the enthalpy h\nthrough u = \u03c7(h). Formal computations yield that (ST) provides the free boundary velocity\nVn = |Du+ | \u2212 |Du\u2212 |\n\non \u2202{u > 0} \u2229 \u2202{u < 0};\n\nVn \u2265 |Du+ |\n\non \u2202{u > 0} \\ \u2202{u < 0};\n\n\u1e7cn \u2264 \u2212|Du\u2212 |\n\non \u2202{u < 0} \\ \u2202{u > 0},\n\n(V)\n\nwhere \u1e7cn is the outward normal velocity of the free boundary of {u \u2265 0}. The inequalities\nare due to the (possible) presence of the mushy region and the non-constant distribution of\nh(x, t). Definitions 2.4 and 2.5 incorporate (V).\nDefinition 2.2. Set D \u2282 Rn+1 is a parabolic neighborhood of a point (x0 , t0 ) if there is\nan open set U , (x0 , t0 ) \u2208 U , such that D = U \u2229 {t \u2264 t0 } and D \u2208 C 0,1 , i.e. the boundary of\nD is locally a graph of a Lipschitz function in x and t.\nDefinition 2.3. A continuous function \u03c6 is a classical subsolution (in a parabolic neighborhood D) of (ST) if\n2,1\n(a) \u03c6 is Cx,t\nin D \u2229 {\u03c6 > 0} and in D \u2229 {\u03c6 < 0},\n\n(b) \u0393(\u03c6) = \u2202{\u03c6 > 0} = \u2202{\u03c6 < 0},\n\n5\n\n\f(c) |D\u03c6+ | and |D\u03c6\u2212 | are nonzero on D \u2229 \u0393(\u03c6) (this makes \u0393(\u03c6) smooth),\n(d) \u03c6t \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 \u2264 0 in D \u2229 {\u03c6 6= 0},\n(e) the outward normal velocity Vn of D \u2229 \u0393(\u03c6) with respect to {\u03c6 > 0} is less than or\nequal to |D\u03c6+ | \u2212 |D\u03c6\u2212 |.\nSimilarly one can define a classical supersolution in a parabolic neighborhood.\nDefinition 2.4. (a) A lower semi-continuous function v is a viscosity supersolution of\n(ST) in Q if (i) v(x, 0) \u2265 \u03c7(h0 ), (ii) v \u2265 \u03b8 on \u2202L Q, and if (iii) for any classical subsolution \u03c6(x, t) in a parabolic neighborhood D \u2282 Q such that \u03c6 \u2264 v on the parabolic\nboundary of D, \u03c6 \u2264 v in D.\n(b) An upper semi-continuous function u is a viscosity subsolution of (ST) in Q if (i)\nu(x, 0) \u2264 \u03c7(h0 ), (ii) u \u2264 \u03b8 on \u2202L Q, and if (iii) for any classical supersolution \u03c6(x, t)\nin a parabolic neighborhood D \u2282 Q such that \u03c6 \u2265 u on the parabolic boundary of D,\n\u03c6 \u2265 u in D.\nObserve that if u is a viscosity subsolution of (ST), then \u2212u is a supersolution of (ST).\nDefinition 2.5. A continuous function u is a viscosity solution of (ST) if it is both viscosity\nsubsolution and supersolution.\nRemark 2.6. Note that above definition of viscosity solutions, unlike that of weak solutions, does not take into account the enthalpy function h(x, t). In particular, we cannot\nexpect uniqueness when the initial data u0 satisfies |{u0 = 0}| > 0. A modified definition,\nincorporating the presence of h(x, t) and therefore yielding a unique representation of the\ninterface evolution, is under investigation by the authors.\n\n3\n\nComparison for strictly separated initial data\n\nA central property for the viscosity solution theory is the comparison principle, which\nis stated in the theorem below. We mention that a corresponding result holds for weak\nsolutions of (ST) (see [15]). As mentioned in the introduction (see Remark 1.2), the proof\npresented in this section extends to a general class two-phase free boundary problems with\nnonlinear free boundary velocity.\nTheorem 3.1. Let u and v be respectively a viscosity subsolution and supersolution on Q\nsuch that u < v on \u2202P Q. Then u < v in Q.\n6\n\n\fFirst we introduce several notations. Let Br (x, t) denote the closed space-time ball with\nradius r and center at (x, t),\nBr (x, t) = {(y, s) : |(y, s) \u2212 (x, t)| \u2264 r},\nand Dr (x, t) the closed space disk with radius r and center at (x, t),\nDr (x, t) = {(y, t) : |y \u2212 x| \u2264 r}.\nWe also speak of the sets\n\u2202Dr (x, t) = {(y, t) : |y \u2212 x| = r} and Dro (x, t) = {(y, t) : |y \u2212 x| < r}\nas the boundary and the interior of Dr (x, t), respectively.\nFor any r > 0, define the sup- and inf-convolutions (see [17])\nZ(x, t) = sup U (y, s),\n\nU (x, t) = sup u(y, s),\n\nBr (x,t)\n\nDr (x,t)\n\nW (x, t) = inf V (y, s),\n\nV (x, t) = inf v(y, s).\n\nBr (x,t)\n\n(3.1)\n\nDr (x,t)\n\nFor any \u03c1 > 0, define\n\u03a9\u03c1 = {x \u2208 \u03a9 : dist(x, \u2202\u03a9) > \u03c1},\nThe convolutions (3.1) are well defined in Cr ,\nCr = \u03a92r \u00d7 (r, T \u2212 r).\nMoreover, we fix r > 0 small enough so that Z < W on \u2202P Cr . Note that Z, U , resp. W , V\nare also viscosity subsolutions, resp. viscosity supersolutions of (ST) in Cr .\nIt will be convenient to define \u03a6r (x, t) to be the closed set\n[\nDr (y, t).\n\u03a6r (x, t) =\n\n(3.2)\n\n(y,s)\u2208Br (x,t)\n\nLastly, we need the following definition:\nDefinition 3.2. Let E be a closed set, let P be a point on the boundary of E, P \u2208 \u2202E, and\nlet B be a closed ball containing P . The ball B will be called an interior ball of E at P if\nB \u2282 E, and it will be called an exterior ball of E at P if B o \u2229 E = \u2205.\nObserve that, by definition, the sets {Z \u2265 0} and {W \u2264 0} have interior balls of radius r\nat each point of their boundaries. These balls are centered on the boundaries of {U \u2265 0}\n7\n\n\fand {V \u2264 0}, respectively. This property of Z and W will be essential in the proofs in this\nsection.\nTo prove that u and v stay ordered, we will argue by contradiction: if u \u2265 v at some time\nt\u03030 , it must be true for Z and W even earlier. Suppose that there is a time t0 when the\nfunctions Z and W first hit,\nt0 = sup {t \u2265 r : Z(*, s) < W (*, s) for all r < s < t}.\nDenote P0 = (x0 , t0 ) the point of maximum of Z \u2212 W at t = t0 . Note that Z(x0 , t0 ) \u2265\nW (x0 , t0 ) because Z \u2212 W is upper semi-continuous.\nNote that the positive set of Z (and the negative set of W ) may expand discontinuously in\ntime, in the event that the zero set of Z (and W ) is of positive measure: this is because\nour definition only considers test functions which are nondegenerate in both positive and\nnegative phases. Therefore one should put extra care in describing the location of P0 and\nthe geometry of the free boundaries nearby.\nLemma 3.3. The set {u \u2265 0} cannot expand discontinuously, i.e.\n{u \u2265 0, t = T } \u2282 {u \u2265 0, t < T }\n\n\u2200T > 0.\n\nAnalogous results hold for {v \u2264 0}, {Z \u2265 0}, {U \u2265 0}, {W \u2264 0} and {V \u2264 0}.\nProof. Suppose that for some T > 0 there is a point P \u2208 {u \u2265 0, t = T } such that P \u2208\n/\n{u \u2265 0, t < T }. In other words, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that B\u03b4 (P ) \u2229 {u \u2265 0, t < T } = \u2205.\nFor simplicity we will translate the coordinates so that P = (0, 0). Define M = maxQ u.\nNote that the ball B\u03b4 (P ) contains a cylinder\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u03b7\n\u03b7 h\nC = (x, t) : |x| \u2264 h + \u03b7, \u2212 min\n,\n\u2264t\u22640\n2\n2M n\nwith h and \u03b7 small positive constants. The situation is shown in Figure 1. We will construct\na classical supersolution of (ST) in C that crosses u from above to obtain a contradiction.\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\n,\nDefine \u03c9 = 2 max 2M\n\u03b7 h . Consider a radially symmetric function in C defined by the\nformula\n\uf8f1\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2a(|x| \u2212 (h \u2212 \u03c9t) ) for |x| \u2264 h \u2212 \u03c9t,\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 2M\nfor |x| > h \u2212 \u03c9t,\n\u03b7 (|x| \u2212 h + \u03c9t)\nwhere a > 0 is a small constant specified below.\n\n8\n\n\ft\nx\nu30\n\nP\nt=T\n\nC\n\nu<0\n\nGH\u03a6L\n\nB\u2206\n\nFigure 1: Situation at point P\nThen \u03c6 satisfies\n\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206) \u03c6 =\n\n\uf8f1\n\u0010\n2M\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03b7 \u03c9\u2212\n\nn\u22121\n|x|\n\n\u0011\n\n>0\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f32a ((h \u2212 \u03c9t)\u03c9 \u2212 n) > 0\n\nfor |x| > h \u2212 \u03c9t,\nfor |x| < h \u2212 \u03c9t.\n\nNext, note that the free boundary \u0393(\u03c6) at time t is the sphere with radius h \u2212 \u03c9t, shrinking\nwith normal velocity \u03c9. Therefore we have\nVn = \u03c9 >\n\n2M\n\u2212 D\u03c6\u2212 = D\u03c6+ \u2212 D\u03c6\u2212 .\n\u03b7\n\nHence \u03c6 is a classical supersolution of (ST) for any a > 0.\nLastly, note that the initial boundary D = C \u2229 {t = \u2212\u03b7/\u03c9} of the cylinder C is a closed\nsubset of {u < 0} and therefore maxD u < 0. We can hence take a > 0 small enough to\nmake \u03c6 > u on D.\nThus we have constructed a classical supersolution \u03c6 on C such that \u03c6 > u on the parabolic\nboundary of C, while \u03c6 < 0 \u2264 u at P = (0, 0). That shows that u crosses \u03c6 from below\ninside C, which contradicts the definition of u.\nThe conclusion for {v \u2264 0} = {\u2212v \u2265 0} can be obtained by repeating the proof for \u2212v.\nCorresponding arguments apply to the sets {Z \u2265 0}, {U \u2265 0}, {W \u2264 0} and {V \u2264 0} as\nwell.\nLemma 3.4. The point P0 lies on the intersection of boundaries of {Z \u2265 0} and {W \u2264 0},\nP0 \u2208 \u2202{Z \u2265 0} \u2229 \u2202{W \u2264 0},\nand\nW (P0 ) \u2264 0 \u2264 Z(P0 ).\n9\n\n\fB1\nB2\nP2\nP1\nU 30\n\nP0\n\nV \u00a30\n\ne1\n\nt\nW \u00a30\n\nZ 30\nx\n\nB0\nFigure 2: Situation at P0\n\nProof. We know that W (P0 ) \u2264 Z(P0 ) from the definition of P0 . There are three cases:\n(a) 0 < W (P0 ) \u2264 Z(P0 ): in this case W > 0 in some neighborhood of P0 ({W > 0} is\nopen as W is a lower-semicontinuous function) and W is a supercaloric function in\nthis neighborhood; this contradicts the fact that Z cannot be crossed from above by\nany positive caloric function \u03c6 (see [11]).\n(b) W (P0 ) \u2264 Z(P0 ) < 0 : the same as above for Z subcaloric in a neighborhood of P0 .\nTherefore we arrive at\nW (P0 ) \u2264 0 \u2264 Z(P0 ).\n\n(3.3)\n\nInequality (3.3) immediately yields that P0 \u2208 {Z \u2265 0} \u2229 {W \u2264 0}. Now suppose that P0\nlies in the interior of the set {Z \u2265 0}. That implies P0 \u2208\n/ {W \u2264 0, t < t0 } since Z < W\nfor t < t0 . But that is a contradiction with continuous expansion of {W \u2264 0}, Lemma 3.3.\nThe same happens when P0 lies in the interior of {W \u2264 0}. Hence the conclusion of the\nlemma.\nThe lemma states that the situation at point P0 looks like the one shown in Figure 2. More\nprecisely, there exist P1 = (x1 , t1 ) \u2208 \u2202{U \u2265 0} and P2 = (x2 , t2 ) \u2208 \u2202{V \u2264 0} such that\nU (P1 ) = Z(P0 ) and V (P2 ) = W (P0 ). At P0 , B1 = Br (x1 , t1 ) = Br (P1 ) is an interior ball of\n{Z \u2265 0} and B2 = Br (x2 , t2 ) = Br (P2 ) is an interior ball of {W \u2264 0}. Moreover, the ball\nB0 = Br (x0 , t0 ) = Br (P0 ) is an exterior ball of {U \u2265 0} at P1 and {V \u2264 0} at P2 .\nSince Z < W for t < t0 , the space projections of B1 and B2 are tangent:\nB1 \u2229 B2 \u2229 {t = t0 } = {P0 }.\n10\n\n\fP1 '\n\nH0,0L\n\nE\n\n\u00b6Fr\n\nG H\u03a6L\nFigure 3: Local situation at P1\u2032\nTherefore the space projections of P0 , P1 and P2 are on a line and we can change the\ncoordinates so that\nP0 = (0, 0),\n\nP1 = (d1 e1 , t1 \u2212 t0 ) and P2 = (\u2212d2 e1 , t2 \u2212 t0 ).\n\n(3.4)\n\nLemma 3.5. Suppose that Z(P0 ) = 0. Then (x1 , t1 ) 6= (x0 , t0 + r). In other words, the line\n(P0 , P1 ) cannot be vertical (i.e., be parallel to the time-direction) and in the future of P0 .\nProof. Suppose that (P1 , P0 ) is vertical, i.e. x1 = x0 , and t1 = t0 + r. Thus there is\nP1\u2032 = (x\u20321 , t1 ) \u2208 Dr (P1 ) such that u(P1\u2032 ) = 0. Lemma 3.4 implies that P0 lies on the\nboundary of {Z \u2265 0}. Therefore u < 0 in the interior of \u03a6r (P0 ), defined in (3.2). This and\nLemma 3.3 yield that u < 0 in the interior of Dr (P1 ) and P1\u2032 lies on the boundary of Dr (P1 ),\ni.e. |x1 \u2212 x\u20321 | = r. We will construct a classical supersolution in a parabolic neighborhood\nof P1\u2032 that crosses u to get a contradiction.\n\u221a\nFirst, let \u03c9 = r/3 and h = 1 + \u03c9 and consider the set\nE := {(x, t) : \u22121 \u2264 t \u2264 0, 1 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9t \u2264 |x| \u2264 1 + 2\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9t}.\n(see Figure 3).\nWe only show the construction for n \u2265 3. The computation is similar when n = 2. Thus\nconsider a radially symmetric function \u03c6(x, t) on E of the form\n(\na(\u2212|x|2\u2212n + (h \u2212 \u03c9t)2\u2212n ) when |x| \u2265 h \u2212 \u03c9t,\n\u03c6(x, t) =\nb(\u2212|x|2\u2212n + (h \u2212 \u03c9t)2\u2212n ) when |x| < h \u2212 \u03c9t,\nwhere a =\n\n\u03c9\nn\u22121\n2n\u22124 h\n\nand b > 0 is a small constant to be chosen later.\n\n\u03c6 then satisfies\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206) \u03c6 = \u2202t \u03c6 = c(n \u2212 2)\u03c9(h \u2212 \u03c9t)1\u2212n > 0\n\n11\n\nif |x| =\n6 h \u2212 \u03c9t,\n\n\fwhere c = a or b. The free boundary of \u03c6 is the shrinking sphere \u0393(\u03c6) = {|x| = h \u2212 \u03c9t}\nand therefore the free boundary condition reads as\nVn = \u03c9 > a(n \u2212 2)(h \u2212 \u03c9t)1\u2212n \u2212 D\u03c6\u2212 = D\u03c6+ \u2212 D\u03c6\u2212 .\nHence \u03c6 is a classical supersolution on E. Now define\n\u03b4=\n\nmin\n\n|x|=1+2\u03c9\u2212\u03c9t\n\u22121\u2264t\u22640\n\n\u03c6 > 0.\n\nand choose \u03b5, 0 < \u03b5 < r, such that u < \u03b4 on B4\u03b5 (P1\u2032 ). This can be done since u(P1\u2032 ) = 0\nand u is upper semi-continuous. Let E \u03b5 and \u03c6\u03b5 be rescaled E and \u03c6 under the parabolic\nscaling (x, t) = (\u03b5x\u0302 + \u03b5x1 /r + (1 \u2212 \u03b5/r)x\u20321 , \u03b52 t\u0302 + t1 ). Note that E \u03b5 \u2282 B4\u03b5 (P1\u2032 ) and \u03c6\u03b5 is still\na supersolution in E \u03b5 .\nFinally, observe that the distance of the lateral boundary of \u03a6r (P0 ) from the time axis\n{x\u0302 = 0} in the rescaled coordinates can be expressed as\np\np\n|x\u0302| = \u22122r t\u0302 \u2212 \u03b52 t\u03022 + 1 \u2265 \u2212r t\u0302 + 1\nif \u2212 1 \u2264 t\u0302 \u2264 0.\n\b\nThus clearly u < 0 on |x\u0302| \u2264 1 + 2\u03c9, t\u0302 = \u22121 and so we can choose b > 0 small enough so\nthat \u03c6\u03b5 (x, t) > u(x, t) on the part of parabolic boundary of E \u03b5 where \u03c6\u03b5 \u2264 0. This can be\ndone as this is a closed subset of {u < 0} and u is upper semi-continuous.\nWith above choices of b and \u03b5, \u03c6\u03b5 is a classical supersolution of (ST) such that \u03c6\u03b5 > u on\nthe parabolic boundary of E \u03b5 and \u03c6\u03b5 (P1\u2032 ) < 0 = u(P1\u2032 ). Therefore u \u2212 \u03c6\u03b5 has a maximum\ninside E \u03b5 , which yields a contradiction with u being a viscosity subsolution.\nThe proof can be repeated with \u2212W in place of Z and other appropriate substitutions.\nWith the previous results, it is now possible to establish the following lemma:\nLemma 3.6.\nZ(P0 ) = W (P0 ) = 0.\nProof. It is enough to prove Z(P0 ) = 0 because W (P0 ) = 0 then follows by repeating the\nproof for \u2212W .\nDue to Lemma 3.4, Z(P0 ) \u2265 0. Suppose Z(P0 ) = L > 0. As in the proof of Lemma 3.5,\nthere is a point P1\u2032 \u2208 Dr (P1 ) such that u(P1\u2032 ) = L. First we discuss a couple of extreme\ncases:\n(a) If (P1 , P0 ) is vertical with P1 in the past of P0 , arguing as in the proof of Corollary\n3.7 we see that (P2 , P0 ) must be vertical with P2 in the future. So either W (P0 ) = 0,\nbut that cannot happen by Lemma 3.5, or W (P0 ) < 0. For W (P0 ) < 0, one could\nargue as in (b) with \u2212W in the place of Z (and other appropriate substitutions).\n12\n\n\fP1 '\n\nQ\u03a4\n\n\u03a9t\n+\nh+\n\nS\n\nh+\n\n\u03a9t\n-\n\n\u2206\n\n\u0397\n\nQ\n\nh\u03a4\n\n\u00b6Fr\n\nFigure 4: Construction of a supersolution when Z(P0 ) > 0.\n(b) If (P1 , P0 ) is vertical with P1 in the future, the fact that P0 \u2208 \u2202{Z \u2265 0} implies u < 0\nin the interior of \u03a6r (P0 ), therefore u < 0 in the interior of Dr (P1 ) by Lemma 3.3 and\nP1\u2032 must be on the boundary of Dr (P1 ). The rest of the argument is parallel to the\none shown below.\nNow suppose that (P0 , P1 ) is not vertical and t1 \u2264 t0 . This allows us to find a small\n\u03c4 > 0 and points Q = (x\u0303, t1 ) and Q\u03c4 = (x\u0303, t1 \u2212 \u03c4 ) such that Dh (Q) \u2229 {u \u2265 0} = {P1 } and\nDh\u03c4 (Q\u03c4 ) \u2229 {u \u2265 0} = \u2205, where h = |P1 \u2212 Q|, 0 < h \u2212 h\u03c4 << 1 (see Figure 4). For simplicity\nwe translate coordinates so that Q = (0, 0).\nDenote M = maxQ u. We will now construct a positive classical supersolution \u03c6 of (ST) in\nS = {(x, t) : \u2212\u03c4 < t < 0, h + \u03c9t \u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 |x| \u2264 h + \u03c9t + \u03b7},\nwhere \u03b7 > 0 and \u03b4 > 0 small are to be chosen and\n\u03c9=\n\nh \u2212 h\u03c4 + \u03b7\n,\n\u03c4\n\nso that \u03c6 will cross u at P1 , yielding a contradiction.\nConsider a spatially radially symmetric function\n\u03c6(x, t) = f (|x| \u2212 \u03c9t),\nwhere\nK=2\n\n\u0012\n\nf (s) = \u2212\n\n2c\n(\u2212Ks + a)3/2 + b,\n3K\n\nh \u2212 h\u03c4 /2 2n \u2212 2\n+\n\u03c4\nh\u03c4\n\n\u0013\n\n>0\n\nand the constants a, b \u2208 R and c > 0 are to be chosen below.\nObserve that g(s) = (f \u2032 (s)/c)2 = \u2212Ks + a. Choose 0 < \u03b7 < 12 h\u03c4 small enough and a \u2208 R\nso that 12 < g(s) < 1 for all h \u2212 \u03b7 \u2264 s \u2264 h + \u03b7. It is also clear that we can find c > 0 and\n13\n\n\fb \u2208 R such that 0 < f (h) < L and f (h + \u03b7) > M . f is continuous and so there is also \u03b4,\n0 < \u03b4 < \u03b7 such that f (h \u2212 \u03b4) > 0.\nIn particular, with this choice of \u03b7, \u03b4, a, b and c, f (s) is positive and strictly increasing in\n[h \u2212 \u03b4, h + \u03b7]. It follows that \u03c6 satisfies\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nn\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206)\u03c6(x, t) = \u2212 \u03c9 +\nf (|x| \u2212 \u03c9t) + f (|x| \u2212 \u03c9t)\n|x|\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\nn\u22121\n\u2032 2\n\u2032\u2032 \u2032\n=\u2212 \u2032 \u03c9+\n(f ) + f f\nf\n|x|\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nn\u22121\n1\nc2\ng + g\u2032\n=\u2212 \u2032 \u03c9+\nf\n|x|\n2\n\u22650\n\nsince \u03c9 +\n\nn\u22121\n|x|\n\n\u2264\n\nK\n2\n\nin S. Therefore \u03c6 is positive and strictly supercaloric in S.\n\nTo conclude, we note that \u03c6 > u on the parabolic boundary of S. This is clear from the fact\nthat \u03c6 > 0 in S and \u03c6 > M on those parts of the parabolic boundary of S that intersect\n{u \u2265 0}. But (u \u2212 \u03c6)(P1 ) > 0 and therefore u crosses \u03c6 from below inside S. That is a\ncontradiction with u being a viscosity subsolution of (ST).\nIf t1 > t0 , including the case when (P1 , P0 ) is vertical, the construction of a supersolution\nis more straightforward but we can also use the above construction with h\u03c4 = h.\nCorollary 3.7. The vectors P0 \u2212 P1 and P0 \u2212 P2 cannot be vertical (i.e., be parallel to the\ntime-direction). In other words, the space projections of P1 and P2 cannot be equal to the\nspace projection of P0 .\nProof. Observe that if say t1 < t0 and the line (P1 , P0 ) is vertical, then also (P2 , P0 ) must be\nvertical and t2 > t0 . This follows from the strict ordering Z(*, t) < W (*, t) for all t < t0 and\nB1 being an interior ball of {Z \u2265 0} and B2 being an interior ball of {W \u2264 0}, i.e. Z \u2265 0\nin B1 and W \u2264 0 in B2 which implies B1 \u2229 B2 \u2229 {t < t0 } = \u2205. That is, B1 \u2229 B2 = {P0 }\nwhenever one of the balls is contained in {t \u2264 t0 }. But Lemma 3.5 asserts that (P2 , P0 )\ncannot be vertical with P2 in the future of P0 . Similarly when (P2 , P0 ) is vertical with\nt2 < t0 .\nDue to Corollary 3.7, the interior ball B1 of {Z \u2265 0} has an interior normal (e1 , m) at\nP0 \u2208 \u2202B1 with |m| < \u221e. Note that m denotes the (outward) normal velocity of the spacetime ball B1 at P0 . Therefore, formally speaking, m is smaller than the normal velocity Vn\nof {Z \u2265 0} at P0 . Since Z is a subsolution of (ST) and since P0 \u2208 \u2202{Z \u2265 0} = \u2202{Z < 0} ,\nfrom the discussion in section 2 (see (V)) formally it must be true that\nm \u2264 |DZ + | \u2212 |DZ \u2212 |.\n14\n\n\fNext lemma states that this is indeed true in a weak sense.\nLemma 3.8.\nlim inf\n\u03bb\u21920+\n\nZ(P0 \u2212 \u03bce1 , 0)\nZ(P0 + \u03bbe1 , 0)\n+ lim inf\n\u2265 m.\n\u03bc\u21920+\n\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\nProof. Let us define\na := lim inf\n\u03bb\u21920+\n\nZ(P0 + \u03bbe1 , 0)\n\u03bb\n\nand b := lim inf\n\u03bc\u21920+\n\nZ(P0 \u2212 \u03bce1 , 0)\n.\n\u03bc\n\nObserve that b < 0. Indeed by Corollary 3.7, we can find a smaller closed ball B \u2282 B2 such\nthat B \u2229 \u2202B2 = P0 and h > 0 such that B \u2229 {t = t0 \u2212 h} =\n6 \u2205. Since Z < W for t < t0 ,\nthere is a smooth function g \u2265 0 that solves the heat equation inside B \u2229 {t0 \u2212 h \u2264 t \u2264 t0 }\nsuch that Z + g < W on B \u2229 {t = t0 \u2212 h}, g > 0 in B o \u2229 {t = t0 \u2212 h} and g = 0 on\n\u2202B \u2229 {t0 \u2212 h \u2264 t \u2264 t0 }. As Z is subcaloric and W is supercaloric in B \u2229 {t0 \u2212 h \u2264 t \u2264 t0 }\nit follows that Z + g \u2264 W on B \u2229 {t = t0 } and\n0 \u2265 lim inf\n\u03bc\u21920+\n\nW (P0 \u2212 \u03bce1 , 0)\n\u2265 b + |Dg (P0 )| > b.\n\u03bc\n\nSuppose a + b < m. Since b < 0, \u03b5 > 0 can be chosen sufficiently small so that\na + b < m \u2212 6\u03b5\n\nand b + 3\u03b5 < 0.\n\nWe will construct a supersolution of (ST) constructed in a parabolic neighborhood K of\nP1 , which will be specified later, which crosses U from above, to yield a contradiction. We\npoint out that, due to the two-phase nature of the problem, the construction of such barrier\nand the domain K requires modifications from the one-phase version constructed in [10]\nand [17].\nFrom the definitions of a and b, there are sequences \u03bbk \u2192 0, \u03bck \u2192 0 with \u03bbk > 0 and \u03bck > 0\nsuch that\nZ(x0 + \u03bbk e1 , t0 ) \u2264 (a + \u03b5)\u03bbk ,\n\nZ(x0 \u2212 \u03bck e1 , t0 ) \u2264 (b + \u03b5)\u03bck .\n\n\u221e\nIn what follows, \u03bb \u2208 {\u03bbk }\u221e\nk=1 and \u03bc \u2208 {\u03bck }k=1 . Now denote Q = P0 + (\u03bbe1 , 0), R =\nP0 + (\u2212\u03bce1 , 0) and BQ , resp. BR the balls centered at Q, resp. R, with radius r. The\nsituation is illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nFrom the definition of Z, it follows that U (x, t) \u2264 Z(y, s) for any (y, s) \u2208 Br (x, t) and thus\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Z(Q) \u2264 (a + \u03b5)\u03bb in BQ ,\nU \u2264 Z(P0 ) = 0\nin B0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nZ(R) \u2264 (b + \u03b5)\u03bc in BR .\n15\n\n\fI\n\nS\n\nS C\n\nT\nP1\n\nP0\nBQ\n\nB0\n\nBR\n\nFigure 5: The slice {t = t1 }\nIn fact, U \u2264 0 on a slightly larger set. Because Z \u2264 W at t = t0 and W \u2264 V (P2 ) = 0 in B2 ,\nwe can conclude that Z \u2264 0 on D = B2 \u2229 {t = t0 }. It means that U \u2264 0 on \u03a3, the union of\nballs of radius r with a center in D,\n[\n\u03a3=\nBr (x, t).\n(x,t)\u2208D\n\nFinally, we have an improved bound,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(a + \u03b5)\u03bb\nU\u2264 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(b + \u03b5)\u03bc\n\nin BQ ,\nin \u03a3,\nin BR .\n\n(3.5)\n\nNow we will compare U with a supersolution in a domain K := K\u03c4\u03bb,\u03bc .

The boundary of the slice is given by the\narc S = \u2202BQ \\ \u03a3, the arc T = \u2202BR \u2229 B0 , and finally of the curve (surface) C that connects\nS and T . C at any given time is composed of C1 = \u2202L \u2229 \u03a3 \\ BR , where L is a cylinder with\naxis e1 connecting I = \u2202BQ \u2229 \u2202\u03a3 with \u2202B0 , and C2 = \u2202B0 \\ (BR \u222a L).\nLet \u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(\u03c1, t), where \u03c1 = |x \u2212 x0 |. We need U \u2264 \u03c6 on the parabolic boundary of\nK\u03c4\u03bb,\u03bc . By Taylor expansion in \u03bb and (t \u2212 t1 ), it follows that the spatial distance of the point\nof intersection I from x0 can be found explicitly for each time t as\nRI (t) = d1 + \u03bb \u2212 m(t \u2212 t1 ) + o (\u03bb) + o (t \u2212 t1 ) \u2264 d1 + \u03bb \u2212 m(t \u2212 t1 ),\n16\n\n\fC\n\nS\n\nT\n\nt\n\nx\nFigure 6: Domain K for n = 2\nwith d1 from (3.4).

Let \u03c6(x, t) be the function \u03c6\u03b1,\u03b2\nR\u0303,m\u0303\nAppendix. Let \u03c4 > 0, \u03b4 > 0 be the small constants and \u03a3\u03c4,\u03b4 be the set from Appendix\nwhere \u03c6 exists and is a radially symmetric classical supersolution that is \"\u03b5-close\" (in the\nsense of (4.5)) to linear functions with slopes \u03b1 and \u03b2 on each side of the spherical free\nboundary of \u03c6 moving with speed m\u0303 and with radius R\u0303 at t = t1 .\nLet R\u0303(t) = R\u0303 \u2212 m\u0303(t \u2212 t1 ) be the radius of the free boundary of \u03c6.

Since \u03c6 is in fact a strict classical supersolution due to\nAppendix, we can perturb \u03c6 into \u03c6\u0303 near P1 such that \u03c6\u0303 is still a classical supersolution with\nU \u2264 \u03c6\u0303 on the parabolic boundary of K\u03c4\u03bb,\u03bc and U > \u03c6\u0303 at P1 . This is a contradiction with\nthe definition of U .\n\n18\n\n\fWe recall that Z \u2264 W at t = t0 .

With this result in mind, we can repeat the argument in Lemma 3.8 to get a\ncontradiction by proving that the quantity (3.7) must be less than or equal to m.\nThis establishes the desired contradiction and we conclude that Z and W stay strictly\nseparated for all times.\nNote that Theorem 3.1 yields ordering only between strictly separated initial data. Therefore it does not directly yield the uniqueness result for viscosity solutions, even with the\nadditional assumption |{u0 = 0}| = 0. However under some restrictions on initial data,\nuniqueness readily follows from Theorem 3.1.\nCorollary 3.9. Let u(x, t) be a viscosity solution of (ST) with initial data u0 and boundary\ndata \u03b8(x, t) = \u03b8(x) < 0, where u0 and \u03b8 satisfies one of the following conditions:\n(a) u0 is strictly concave;\n(b) \u03b8(x, t) \u2261 \u03b8 < 0 and both \u03a9 and u0 is star-shaped: i.e. for sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0,\n(1 + \u03b5)\u22121 \u03a9 \u2282 \u03a9 and u0 (x) \u2264 u0 ((1 + \u03b5)\u22121 x), where equality only holds at x = 0.\nThen u(x, t) is unique.\nProof. 1. Let us begin by mentioning that for any a, b and c > 0, if u is a viscosity sub\n(super)-solution of (ST), then so is\nau(bx, ab2 t + c).\n2. Now let u and v be two viscosity solutions of (ST) with initial data u0 . In the case of\n(a), one can verify via barrier arguments that v(x, t) \u2264 u0 (x) if 0 \u2264 s < t with equality\nholding only at \u2202L Q. In particular, for sufficiently small \u03b5 and \u03b4 such that 0 < \u03b5 \u226a \u03b4 \u226a 1,\nwe have (1 + \u03b5)v(x, \u03b4) < u0 (x) (recall that \u03b8 is negative). Therefore observation made in\nstep 1 and Theorem 3.1 yields\n(1 + \u03b5)v(x, (1 + \u03b5)t + \u03b4) < u(x, t)\n19\n\nin Q\n\n\ffor any 0 < \u03b5 \u226a \u03b4 \u226a 1. Now we can send \u03b4 \u2192 0 and \u03b5 \u2192 0 to obtain v \u2264 u. Similarly we\ncan argue with v and u switched to obtain u \u2264 v, and therefore u = v.\nIn the second case, note that for any \u03b5 > 0 and \u03b4 > 0,\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22121 u0 (x) < u0 ((1 + \u03b5)\u22121 x) in \u03a9.\nAlso, since u0 is star-shaped, the minimum of u0 (and u and v) equals \u03b8. Since u and v are\nnegative caloric functions near \u2202\u03a9, Hopf's lemma yields that the inward normal derivative\nof u(*, t) and v(*, t) on \u2202\u03a9 is strictly positive. In particular for any T > 0 there exists\n\u03b4 = O(\u03b5) such that\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22121 \u03b8 < u((1 + \u03b5)\u22121 x, t) for (x, t) \u2208 \u2202L Q.\nHence Theorem 3.1 again yields that, for sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0,\n(1 + \u03b4)\u22121 v(x, (1 + \u03b4)\u22121 t) < u((1 + \u03b5)\u22121 x, (1 + \u03b5)\u22122 t)\n\nin Q.\n\nTherefore, by sending \u03b5 \u2192 0, we can conclude that v \u2264 u. As before, by switching v and u\nin above argument one can conclude v = u.\n\nFor a general uniqueness result using the comparison principle we refer to section 4 in [17]\nwhere rather technical barrier arguments take place. We have not attempted to follow\nthis approach since, as mentioned before, we are interested in the coincidence of the two\ngeneralized solutions for (ST).\n\n4\n\nCorrespondence between weak and viscosity solutions\n\nRecall that, due to [15,18,19], there exists a unique weak solution h of problem (ST), defined\nin Definition 2.1, with initial data h0 and boundary data \u03b8. Let us define u = \u03c7(h) to be\nthe weak temperature solution of (ST) associated with initial enthalpy function h0 , see [15].\nLemma 4.1. Any weak temperature solution u of (ST) with initial data u0 = \u03c7(h0 ) is a\nviscosity solution of (ST).\nProof. The analysis in [8] yields that weak temperature solutions are continuous for continuous \u03c7(h0 ). Moreover, a comparison principle holds for weak solutions. Indeed, if h1 and\nh2 are two weak solutions with h1 \u2264 h2 on \u2202P Q, then h1 \u2264 h2 in Q. See [19], for instance.\nThe comparison principle can be extended to accommodate weak sub and supersolutions.\nA function h1 is a weak subsolution if it satisfies (2.1) in Definition 2.1 with \u2265 instead of\n20\n\n\fequality for all \u03c6 \u2208 W22,1 (Q), \u03c6 \u2265 0, \u03c6 = 0 on \u2202L Q \u222a {t = T }. A function h2 is a weak\nsupersolution if it satisfies (2.1) with \u2264 instead of equality for all \u03c6 as above. A comparison\nprinciple still holds. If h1 \u2264 h2 on the parabolic boundary \u2202P Q then h1 \u2264 h2 in Q. It is\nstraightforward to check that the comparison principle on a cylindrical domain implies a\ncomparison principle on a general parabolic neighborhood in the sense of Definition 2.2.\nA standard integration by parts also shows that a classical subsolution \u03c6 in Definition 2.3\ncorresponds to a weak subsolution \u03c7\u22121 (\u03c6), and also that a classical supersolution \u03c6 is a\nweak supersolution \u03c7\u22121 (\u03c6): note that, by definition, \u03c6 and \u03c6 have no mushy region and\nthus \u03c7\u22121 \u03c6 and \u03c7\u22121 \u03c6 are well defined almost everywhere. We deduce from this that we\ncan compare weak temperature solutions with classical sub and supersolutions. Hence we\nconclude that weak temperature solutions are viscosity solutions of (ST) in the sense of\nDefinition 2.5.\nCorollary 4.2. There exists a viscosity solution of (ST) for continuous \u03c7(h0 ) and \u03b8.\nUnfortunately it is not clear to the authors how to find a corresponding weak solution for\na given viscosity solution when the initial data has a fat zero set. However it is possible\nto identify the maximal and minimal viscosity solution with maximal and minimal weak\ntemperature solutions (see Proposition 4.4). To prove this we first need a uniform control\non the expansion of the sets {u \u2264 0} and {u \u2265 0} at t = 0 in terms of the L\u221e -norm of the\ninitial data.\nLemma 4.3. Let u be a viscosity solution of (ST) with initial data u0 . Then for any\nr > 0 the set {u \u2264 0} does not expand by more than r before the time tr = cr 2 , where\nc = c(n, M ) is a constant specified later in the proof, depending only on the dimension n\nand M = max\u2202P Q |u0 |. In other words,\n{x : u(x, t) \u2264 0} \u2282 {x : dist(x, {u0 \u2264 0}) \u2264 r}\nfor all t \u2208 [0, tr ].\nThe same is true for {u \u2265 0}.\nProof. We only prove the lemma for {u \u2264 0}. Parallel argument holds for {u \u2265 0}.\nSet\nAr = {x : dist(x, {u0 \u2264 0}) > r}.\nWe need to show that u(x, t) > 0 in Ar \u00d7 [0, tr ], for tr specified below.\nThus choose x0 \u2208 Ar . Define the function\n(\nf (\u03c1) =\n\n1\n\u03c1n\u22122\n\n\u2212 1,\n\n\u2212 log \u03c1,\n21\n\nn \u2265 3,\n\nn = 2.\n\n\fNote that f is decreasing and f (1) = 0. For simplicity we show the following computation\nfor n \u2265 3 only. The case n = 2 is similar.\nSet K =\n\nM\n|f (2)|\n\nand v =\n\n8K(n\u22122)\n.\nr\n\nWe will construct a classical subsolution of (ST) in the set\n\nC = {(x, t) : |x \u2212 x0 | < r \u2212 vt, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 tr }\nthat is below u on the parabolic boundary of C and is positive at x0 for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 tr .\nDefine the radially symmetric function \u03c6 = \u03c6(x, t) in C as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(\n0|\nKf 2|x\u2212x\n, 2|x \u2212 x0 | > r \u2212 vt,\nr\u2212vt\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\u03c6\u0303(x, t),\n2|x \u2212 x0 | < r \u2212 vt,\nwhere \u03c6\u0303(x, t) is a solution of the heat equation in the domain\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\nC 1 = (x, t) : |x \u2212 x0 | < (r \u2212 vt) , t \u2208 (0, tr )\n2\n2\nwith smooth positive initial data \u03c6\u0303(x, 0) < u(x, 0) in the interior of D = {x : |x \u2212 x0 | < r/2}\nand boundary data 0.\nThe modulus of the gradient |D\u03c6\u2212 | on the free boundary \u0393(\u03c6) is\nD\u03c6\u2212 = K f \u2032 (1)\nFor t < tr =\n\nr\n2v\n\n= c(n, M )r 2 ,\nD\u03c6\u2212 <\n\n2K(n \u2212 2)\n2\n=\n.\nr \u2212 vt\nr \u2212 vt\n\nv\n4K(n \u2212 2)\n= = \u2212Vn .\nr\n2\n\nTherefore \u03c6 is a classical subsolution of (ST) in the set C. Also, \u03c6 < u on the parabolic\nboundary \u2202P C. The definition of viscosity subsolution then implies \u03c6 \u2264 u in the set C and\ntherefore u > 0 at x0 for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 tr .\nProposition 4.4. There exist maximal and minimal viscosity solutions U1 (x, t) and U2 (x, t)\nof (ST) satisfying the following:\nU2 \u2264 u \u2264 U1\n\nfor any viscosity solution u of (ST).\n\nFurthermore, U1 is the unique weak temperature solution of (ST) with the initial enthalpy\n\u001a\nu0\nif u0 \u2265 0,\nmax\nh0 :=\nu0 \u2212 1 if u0 < 0,\nand U2 is the unique weak temperature solution of (ST) with the initial enthalpy\n\u001a\nu0\nif u0 > 0,\nmin\nh0 :=\nu0 \u2212 1 if u0 \u2264 0.\n22\n\n\fProof. 1. Take an approximation w0\u03b5 < u0 < v0\u03b5 such that the zero set of the approximation\nhas zero measure. This can be done, for example, with simply w0\u03b5 = u0 \u2212 \u03b5 and v0\u03b5 = v0 + \u03b5\nfor along a sequence of \u03b5 \u2192 0. Indeed the function F (\u03b5) := |{u0 > 0}| \u2212 |{u0 > \u03b5}| is\na monotone, bounded function. therefore it can only have countable number of jumps.\nExcept at these jumps, |{u0 = \u03b5}| = 0.\nLet us choose a viscosity solution v \u03b5 (and w\u03b5 ) of (ST) respectively with initial data v0\u03b5\n(resp. w0\u03b5 ) and lateral boundary data \u03b8 + \u03b5 (resp. \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b5). In particular (excluding a\ncountable number of \u03b5) the functions v0\u03b5 and w0\u03b5 have no mushy region, and therefore h1,\u03b5\n0 :=\n2,\u03b5\n\u22121\n\u03b5\n\u22121\n\u03b5\n\u03c7 (w0 ) and h0 := \u03c7 (v0 ) are well-defined almost everywhere, hence the corresponding\nweak solutions h1,\u03b5 and h2,\u03b5 exist. Now, by Lemma 4.1, the weak temperature solution\nv \u03b5 := \u03c7(h1,\u03b5 ) (resp. w\u03b5 := \u03c7(h2,\u03b5 )) is a viscosity solution of (ST) with initial data v0\u03b5 (resp.\nw0\u03b5 ). Let u be a viscosity solution of (ST) with initial data u0 . Let \u00fb be the unique weak\ntemperature solution of (ST) with boundary data h0 := \u03c7\u22121 (u0 ). For convenience, let us\ndenote the initial and lateral boundary data g := (u0 , \u03b8).\n2. The proof of the following lemma will be presented in the Appendix:\nLemma 4.5. The functions v \u03b5 (or w\u03b5 ), along a subsequence, uniformly converge to a continuous function u with boundary data g .\nDue to the stability of viscosity solutions, it is straightforward to verify that u is a viscosity\nsolution of (ST) with boundary data g.\nOn the other hand, due to stability result of [19], for each time t > 0 the weak soution\n.\nh1,\u03b5 (*, t) converges to h(*, t) in L1 -norm, where h(*, 0) = hmax\n0\nUsing the uniform convergence of v \u03b5 := \u03c7(h1,\u03b5 ), it is easy to check that u = \u03c7(h) = U1 a.e.\n3. Lastly, Theorem 3.1 yields that any viscosity solution u of (ST) with initial data u0\nsatisfies\nw\u03b5 < u < v \u03b5 , and thus taking \u03b5 \u2192 0 we obtain U2 \u2264 u \u2264 U1 .\n\nThe following Theorem is obtained as a corollary of Propostion 4.4\nTheorem 4.6. The viscosity solution u of (ST) with |{u0 = 0}| = 0 coincides with the\nweak temperature solution and it is unique.\n\n23\n\n\f\u00b6\u2206\n\n\u03a6Hx, tL\n-\u0392\n\u2206\n\nH0, tL\n\nRt\n\n\u03a1\n\n\u2206\n\u0391\n\u00b6\u2206\n\nFigure 7: Test function \u03c6(r, t) at time t\n\nAppendix\nFirst we construct \"two-phase\" test functions for the barrier arguments in the proof of the\ncomparison principle, Theorem 3.1.\nA. Test functions. Here we provide a construction of a class of radially symmetric classical\nsub- and supersolutions for that purpose. We will be working in spherical coordinates and\nthus we shall denote \u03c1 = |x|.\nLet \u03b1 6= 0, \u03b2 6= 0, \u03b5 > 0, R > 0 and m be given parameters satisfying\nsign \u03b1 6= sign \u03b2\n\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 6= m sign \u03b2.\n\nand\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe show below that one can find constants \u03c4 > 0, \u03b4 > 0 and q such that a test function\n\u03c6(x, t) of the form\n\u03c6(x, t) = \u03c60 (|x| \u2212 R \u2212 mt).\nwith\n\n(\n2\n\u03b1s + q s2\n\u03c60 (s) =\n2\n\u2212\u03b2s + q s2\n\ns \u2265 0,\ns < 0,\n\ndefined in the domain\n\u03a3\u03c4,\u03b4 = {(x, t) : R + mt \u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 |x| \u2264 R + mt + \u03b4, \u2212\u03c4 \u2264 t \u2264 0},\nis a classical subsolution (or supersolution) of (ST) on \u03a3\u03c4,\u03b4 , see Figure 7. Moreover, \u03c6(x, t)\nis \"\u03b5-close\" to a linear function of \u03c1 on both sides of the free boundary \u0393(\u03c6), see (4.5).\nWe shall denote Rt = R + mt since the set \u0393(\u03c6) = {(x, t) : r = R + mt} is the free boundary\nof \u03c6. Observe that on \u0393(\u03c6), we have\nD\u03c6+ = max (\u03b1, \u03b2) ,\n\nD\u03c6\u2212 = \u2212 min (\u03b1, \u03b2) .\n24\n\n\fand thus\nD\u03c6+ \u2212 D\u03c6\u2212 = \u03b1 + \u03b2.\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe can also deduce the direction of the outer normal of {\u03c6 > 0}, and hence the sign of\nthe normal velocity Vn , from the signs of \u03b1 and \u03b2 due to (4.1). As \u0393(\u03c6) is the space ball\nexpanding with speed m, we recognize two situations:\n(\n\u2212m when \u03b2 < 0,\n(4.3)\nVn =\nm\nwhen \u03b2 > 0.\nNow we can express the free boundary condition in the light of (4.2) and (4.3) as\n(a) m sign \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b1 + \u03b2 for a classical supersolution,\n(b) m sign \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1 + \u03b2 for a classical subsolution.\nSuppose that the condition in (a) is satisfied and we are thus constructing a classical supersolution. In this case, the function \u03c6 has to satisfy also (\u2202t \u2212 \u2206)\u03c6 \u2265 0 in {\u03c6 =\n6 0}.\nStraightforward computation yields\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206) \u03c6(x, t)|\u03c1=R+\nt\n\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206) \u03c6(x, t)|\u03c1=R\u2212\nt\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nn\u22121\n= \u2212\u03b1 m +\n\u2212 q,\nRt\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\u22121\n\u2212 q.\n=\u03b2 m+\nRt\n\nContinuity allows us to choose small \u03c4 > 0 and \u03b4 > 0 and a suitable constant q such that\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2206) \u03c6(x, t) \u2265 0\n\nin \u03a3\u03c4,\u03b4 \\ \u0393(\u03c6)\n\n(4.4)\n\nand\n\nin \u03a3\u03c4,\u03b4 .\n\n\u03c6(x, t)\n\u2212 \u03b1 < \u03b5,\n\u03c1 \u2212 Rt\n\u03c6(x, t)\n\u2212 \u03b2 < \u03b5,\nRt \u2212 \u03c1\n\nwhen \u03c1 > Rt ,\n(4.5)\nwhen \u03c1 < Rt ,\n\nThus let \u03c6\u03b1,\u03b2\nclassical supersolution constructed above with the parameters R,\nR,m denote the\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nm, \u03b1 and \u03b2.

Proof of Lemma 4.5. We will only prove the Lemma for v \u03b5 . The argument for w\u03b5 is\nparallel. Let uk := v 1/k and let gk the corresponding initial and lateral boundary data of\nv 1/k .\n[8] provide us with a uniform bound on the W21,0 (Q) norm and with a uniform modulus of\ncontinuity \u03c9d for v \u03b5 in the domains away from \u2202P Q:\nQd = {(x, t) \u2208 Q : dist((x, t), \u2202P Q) > d},\n\nd > 0.\n\nTherefore we need a uniform modulus of continuity on \u2202P Q to be able to extract a subsequence of uk converging uniformly. We will obtain this by comparing uk to solutions of the\nheat equation near the parabolic boundary of Q.\nFirst find k0 for which gk0 < 0 on \u2202L Q. Theorem 3.1 implies uk decreases in k.

We split uk = uk+ \u2212 uk\u2212 and consider each of uk\u00b1 \u2265 0\nseparately.\n\b\nChoose r > 0 small and fix k. Let Ak = x \u2208 \u03a9 : g k > 0 .

Moreover, tr\ncan be chosen independent of k. Construct a solution \u03c6k to the heat equation in Akr \u00d7 (0, tr )\nwith boundary data 0 on (\u2202Akr \u2229 \u03a9) \u00d7 (0, tr ) and gk (x, t)\u03b6 k (x) on the rest of the parabolic\nboundary of Akr \u00d7 (0, tr ). \u03b6 k is chosen to be a smooth cutoff function with values in [0, 1]\non Akr such that \u03b6 k = 1 on Ak2r and \u03b6 k = 0 on \u2202Akr \u2229 \u03a9. It is also chosen in such a way that\n\u03b6 k C 0,1 is uniformly bounded in k. Define \u03c6kr = 0 in the complement of Akr \u00d7 (0, tr ).
