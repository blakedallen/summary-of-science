Even a Schwarzschild black hole,\nwhen it radiates, does not have a single horizon that fully characterizes its structure, and\none must distinguish at least three important horizon-like loci. The future event horizon\n(EH) is the boundary of the causal past of future null infinity, and it represents the locus\nof outgoing future-directed null geodesic rays that never manage to reach arbitrarily large\ndistances from the hole. The apparent horizon (AH) is defined as the outermost marginally\ntrapped surface for the outgoing photons. Classically it can be null or spacelike, in presence\nof quantum radiance it can be timelike also, when regarded as a 3-dimensional surface. The\nthird important locus is the timelike limit surface (TLS) or \"quasi-static limit\" which is\ndefined as the locus where static observers become lightlike. The TLS can be null, timelike,\nor spacelike [2]. For a classical Schwarzschild black hole (which does not radiate), the three\nsurfaces EH, AH, and TLS are all identical. Upon \"switching on\" the Hawking evaporation\nthis degeneracy is partially lifted. According to the analysis by York [2, 3] the AH continues\nto coincide with the TLS for a spherically symmetric emission, but the EH is different from\nAH=TLS.\nIn particular, if we approximate the stress-energy tensor near the horizon as a radial\ninflux of negative energy which balances the outward Hawking flux at infinity, the event\nhorizon is located inside the AH [5], the portion of spacetime between the two surfaces\nforming the so-called \"quantum ergosphere\". This name stems from the analogy with the\nclassical (stationary) Kerr black hole for which EH=AH6=TLS. Here the ergosphere is the\nspace between \"the\" horizon EH=AH and the TLS, usually called the \"static limit\". In both\ncases particles and light signals can escape from within the ergosphere and reach infinity.\nThe definition of the EH via the locus of outgoing photons that can never reach large\ndistances from the hole has the unfortunate \"teleological\" property of requiring knowledge\nof the entire future history of the hole [2, 6]. In particular when the black hole radiance is described semiclassically (quantized matter in a classical geometry), the Bekenstein-Hawking\ntemperature and the luminosity diverge for M \u2192 0, as TBH \u221d 1/M and L \u221d 1/M 2 , respectively. As a result, this approximation breaks down for very light holes, and in order to\n2\n\n\fdetermine the final state of the evaporation process a much more precise treatment, including\nbackreaction and quantum gravitational effects, is required.\nIn York's work [2, 3], which is strictly within the semiclassical approximation, the \"teleological\" problem is circumvented by relaxing the definition of the EH in the following way.\nRather than demanding that the photons \"never\" reach infinity he demands only that they\nare imprisoned by the event horizon for times which are very long compared to the dynamical\ntime scale of the hole. Using this working definition of the EH he is then able to determine\nits location to first order in the luminosity L. In this manner the difficult question about\nthe real final state of the evaporation is not touched upon.\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to analyze the dynamical evaporation process and\nthe corresponding spacetime structure of a radiating Schwarzschild black hole. We include\nthe leading quantum gravitational corrections of the geometry which, as we shall discuss,\nseem to lead to a termination of the evaporation process and the formation of a cold, Planck\nsize remnant. Our main tool will be the \"renormalization group improvement\" of classical\nsolutions, a technique which is very popular in conventional field theory.\nIn fact, recently a lot of work went into the investigation of the nonperturbative\nrenormalization group (RG) behavior of Quantum Einstein Gravity [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] and its possible manifestations\n[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. In particular, in [28], a \"RG-improvement\"\nof the Schwarzschild metric has been performed and the properties of the corresponding\n\"quantum black hole\" have been explored. The improvement was based upon the scale dependent (\"running\") Newton constant G(k) obtained from the exact RG equation for gravity\n[7] describing the scale dependence of the effective average action [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Here k\ndenotes the mass scale of the infrared cutoff which is built into the effective average action\n\u0393k [g\u03bc\u03bd ] in such a way that it generates the field equations for a metric which has been averaged over a spacetime volume of linear dimension k \u22121 . The running of G is approximately\ngiven by\nG0\n(1.1)\n1 + \u03c9 G0 k 2\nwhere G0 denotes the laboratory value of Newton's constant, and \u03c9 is a constant. At\nG(k) =\n\nlarge distances (k \u2192 0), G(k) approaches G0 , and in the ultraviolet limit (k \u2192 \u221e), it\n\ndecreases as G(k) \u221d 1/k 2 . This is the fixed point behavior responsible for the conjectured\nnonperturbative renormalizability of Quantum Einstein Gravity [7, 9, 11, 12].\n3\n\n\fIn the RG improvement scheme of [28] the information about the k-dependence of G is\nexploited in the following way. The starting point is the classical Schwarzschild metric (in\nSchwarzschild coordinates)\nds2 = \u2212f (r)dt2 + f (r)\u22121dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92\n\n(1.2)\n\nwith d\u03a92 \u2261 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 and the classical lapse function f (r) = 1 \u2212 2G0 M/r \u2261 fclass (r).\nThe RG improvement is effected by substituting, in fclass (r), G0 by the r-dependent Newton\nconstant G(r) \u2261 G(k = k(r)) which obtains from G(k) via an appropriate \"cutoff identification\" k = k(r). In flat space the natural choice would be k \u221d 1/r. In [28] we argued that in\nthe Schwarzschild background the correct choice, in leading order at least, is k(r) = \u03be/d(r)\nRr\nwhere \u03be is a constant of the order of unity, and d(r) \u2261 0 dr \u2032 |fclass (r \u2032 )|\u22121/2 is the proper\ndistance from a point with coordinate r to the center of the black hole. (We refer to [28]\nfor a detailed physical justification of this choice.) While the integral defining d(r) can be\nevaluated exactly, it is sufficient to use the following approximation which becomes exact\nfor both r \u2192 \u221e and r \u2192 0:\nd(r) =\n\n\u0012\n\nr3\nr + \u03b3 G0 M\n\nThe resulting G(r) \u2261 G(k = \u03be/d(r)) reads\nG(r) =\n\n\u0013 12\n\nG0 r 3\nr 3 + \u03c9\u0303 G0 [r + \u03b3G0 M]\n\n(1.3)\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u03c9\ne \u2261 \u03c9\u03be 2. In these equations the parameter \u03b3 has the value \u03b3 = 9/2 if one sets\n\nk = \u03be/d(r) as above. It turns out, however, that most of the qualitative properties of the\nimproved metric, in particular all those related to the structure of its horizons, are fairly\ninsensitive to the precise value of \u03b3. In particular, \u03b3 = 0 (corresponding to k = \u03be/r) and\n\n\u03b3 = 9/2 where found [28] to lead to rather similar results throughout. For this reason\nwe shall adopt the choice \u03b3 = 0 in the present paper. It has the advantage that with this\nchoice many calculations can be performed analytically which require a numerical treatment\notherwise.\nThe metric of the RG improved Schwarzschild black hole is given by the line element\n(1.2) with\nf (r) = 1 \u2212\n\n4\n\n2G(r)M\nr\n\n(1.5)\n\n\fLet us briefly list its essential features1 .\na) There exists a critical mass value2\nMcr =\n\n\u221a\np\n\u03c9\ne /G0 = \u03c9\ne mPl\n\n(1.6)\n\nsuch that f (r) has two simple zeros at r\u2212 and r+ > r\u2212 if M > Mcr , one double zero at\n\u221a\nr+ = r\u2212 = \u03c9\ne G0 if M = Mcr , and no zero at all if M < Mcr .

At Mcr ,\nthe black hole is extremal, the two horizons coincide, and the spacetime is free from any\nhorizon if the mass is sufficiently small, M < Mcr .\nb) The Bekenstein-Hawking temperature TBH = \u03ba/2\u03c0 is given by the surface gravity at\nthe outer horizon, \u03ba = 21 f \u2032 (r+ ).

It is given by L = \u03c3A(M)TBH (M)4 where \u03c3 is a constant and A \u2261 4\u03c0r+\ndenotes the\n\narea of the outer horizon.

In the small luminosity limit (L \u2192 0) this metric is\nsupposed to reduce to the static metric of the RG improved Schwarzschild spacetime.\nWe begin by reexpressing the metric (1.2) with the improved lapse function (1.5) in terms\nof ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6). We trade the Schwarzschild time t\nfor the advanced time coordinate\n\u22c6\n\n\u22c6\n\nv =t+r ,\n\nr \u2261\n\nZ\n\nr\n\ndr \u2032 /f (r \u2032)\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere r \u22c6 is a generalization of the familiar \"tortoise\" radial coordinate to which it reduces if\nG(r) = const. For G(r) 6= const the function r \u22c6 = r \u22c6 (r) is more complicated, but its explicit\nform will not be needed here. Eq.(2.1) implies dv = dt + dr/f (r), turning (1.2) with (1.5)\ninto\nds2 = \u2212[1 \u2212 2G(r)M/r] dv 2 + 2dvdr + r 2 d\u03a92\n\n(2.2)\n\nEq.(2.2) is exactly the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, with G0\nreplaced by G(r). It is thus reassuring to see that the two operations, the RG improvement\nG0 \u2192 G(r) and the change of the coordinate system, can be performed in either order, they\n\"commute\".\nThe thermodynamical properties derived in [28] and summarized in the previous section\nrefer to the metric (2.2). In the exterior of the hole the spacetime is static, and while we\ncan deduce a temperature and a corresponding luminosity from its periodicity in imaginary\ntime (or by computing the surface gravity at r+ directly) the backreaction of the mass-loss\ndue to the evaporation is not described by (2.2). From the static metric we obtained the\nmass dependence of the luminosity, L = L(M). Using this information we can compute the\nmass of the hole as seen by a distant observer at time v, M(v), by solving the differential\nequation\nd\nM(v) = L(M(v))\n(2.3)\ndv\nIn our case L(M) is given by Eq.(1.10). To first order in the luminosity, the metric which\n\u2212\n\nincorporates the effect of the decreasing mass is obtained by replacing the constant M in\n(2.2) with the M(v) obtained from Eq.(2.3):\nds2 = \u2212[1 \u2212 2G(r)M(v)/r] dv 2 + 2dvdr + r 2 d\u03a92\n6\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fFor G(r) = const, Eq.(2.4) is the Vaidya metric which frequently had been used to explore\nthe influence of the Hawking radiation on the geometry [43, 44, 45]. It is a solution of\nEinstein's equation G\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0G0 T\u03bc\u03bd where T\u03bc\u03bd describes an inward moving null fluid. In this\npicture the decrease of M is due to the inflow of negative energy, as it is appropriate if the\nfield whose quanta are radiated off is in the Unruh vacuum [46].\nThe metric (2.4) can be regarded as a RG improved Vaidya metric. It encapsulates two\ndifferent mechanisms whose combined effect can be studied here: the black hole radiance,\nand the modifications of the spacetime structure due to the quantum gravity effects, the\nrunning of G in particular.\nIt is instructive to ask which energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd would give rise to the improved\nVaidya metric (2.4) according to the classical equation G\u03bc \u03bd = 8\u03c0G0 T\u03bc \u03bd . Computing the\nEinstein tensor of (2.4) one finds that its only non-zero components are\nT vv = T rr = \u2212\nT rv =\n\nG\u2032 (r)M(v)\n8\u03c0G0 r 2\n\nG(r)\u1e40(v)\n8\u03c0G0 r 2\n\nT \u03b8 \u03b8 = T \u03c6\u03c6 = \u2212\n\nG\u2032\u2032 (r)M(v)\n16\u03c0G0r\n\n(2.5a)\n(2.5b)\n(2.5c)\n\nHere the prime (dot) denotes a derivative with respect to r(v). The non-zero components\n(2.5) contain either r- or v-derivatives but no mixed terms. The terms with r-derivatives of\nG, also present for M(v) = const, describe the vacuum energy density and pressure of the\nimproved Schwarzschild spacetime in absence of radiation effects. They have been discussed\nin [28] already. Allowing for M(v) 6= const, the new feature is a nonzero component T r v 6= 0\nwhich, for \u1e40 < 0, describes the inflow of negative energy into the black hole.\nTaking advantage of the luminosity function L(M), Eq.(1.10), we can solve the differential equation (2.3) numerically and obtain the mass function M = M(v). (We have set\n\u03c3/(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\ne = 1 in the numerical calculations in order to reach the almost complete evaporation for v \u2248 200 in units of rcr .) The result is shown in Fig.(1) for various initial masses, in\n\nthe domain v > 0. In fact, for definiteness we assume that the black hole is formed at v = 0\n\nby the implosion of a spherical null shell [44]. Hence M(v) is given by Fig.(1) together with\nM = 0 for v < 0. We observe that, for any initial mass, M(v) approaches the critical mass\nMcr for v \u2192 \u221e. This behavior is the most important manifestation of the quantum gravity\neffects: according to Eq.(1.9), the temperature TBH (M) goes to zero when M approaches\n7\n\n\fFIG. 1: The ratio M/Mcr as a function of v/rcr for various initial masses.\n\nMcr from above. Hence the luminosity vanishes, too, the evaporation process stops, and\nM(v) \u2248 Mcr remains approximately constant at very late times, v \u226b Mcr\u22121 .\nIn Fig.(2) and Fig.(3) we plot the advanced time dependence of the temperature TBH (v) \u2261\nTBH (M(v)) and the luminosity L(v) \u2261 L(M(v)), respectively. They are obtained by inserting\nthe numerical solution of Eq.(2.3) into (1.9) and (1.10).\nBoth the very early and the very late stages of the evaporation process can be described\nanalytically. A black hole with M(v = 0) \u226b Mcr starts in what we call the \"Hawking\nregime\". It is defined by the approximation \u03a9 \u2248 0 which is realized if the hole is very heavy\n(M \u226b Mcr ) or if \u03c9\ne = 0 in the semiclassical limit where the quantum gravity corrections are\n\n8\n\n\fFIG. 2: Time dependence of the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature during the evaporation process\nfor the same initial masses as in Fig.(1).\n\n\"switched off\". In the Hawking regime, (1.9) and (1.10) reproduce the familiar results\nTBH (M) =\n\n1\n8\u03c0G0 M\n\nL(M) =\n\nB\n,\nM2\n\nG20\n\n(2.6a)\nB\u2261\n\n\u03c3\n4(4\u03c0)3\n\n(2.6b)\n\nIt is easy to solve the differential equation \u2212\u1e40 = L(M) for the luminosity (2.6b). With the\ninitial condition M(v = 0) = M0 the solution reads\nh\ni1/3\nM(v) = M03 \u2212 3(B/G20 ) v\n.\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis is the mass function during the early stages of the evaporation process, valid as long as\nM(v) is well above the critical mass. If one naively extrapolates (2.7) to small masses one\nfinds M(v0 ) = 0, implying a final \"explosion\" with T \u2192 \u221e and L \u2192 \u221e, after a finite time\n9\n\n\fFIG. 3: The black hole's luminosity as a function of v/rcr , for the same initial masses as in Fig.(1)\nand Fig.(2).\n\nv0 = G20 M03 /(3B). As a consequence of the quantum gravity effects, this is not what really\nhappens, however.\nThe final part of the evaporation process, where the cold remnant forms, is in the \"critical\nregime\". It is described by those terms in the above expressions which are dominant for\nM \u0581 Mcr , or \u03a9 \u0580 1. From (1.9) and (1.10) we obtain in this approximation:\n1 p 2\nM \u2212 Mcr2\n4\u03c0e\n\u03c9\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03c3G0\n2\n2\nL(M) =\nM \u2212 Mcr\n(4\u03c0e\n\u03c9 )3\n\nTBH (M) =\n\n(2.8a)\n(2.8b)\n\nSolving \u2212\u1e40 = L(M) with (2.8b) one finds\nM(v) = Mcr +\n\nM1 \u2212 Mcr\n1 + \u03b1(M1 \u2212 Mcr )(v \u2212 v1 )\n10\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fHere \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c3/(16\u03c0 3 \u03c9\ne 2 ), and v1 is a time, already in the critical regime, where M(v1 ) = M1\n\nis imposed. For v \u2192 \u221e, the difference M(v) \u2212 Mcr vanishes proportional to 1/v, as a\nconsequence of which TBH (v) \u2192 0 and L(v) \u2192 0.\n\nWe mentioned already that the RG improved Vaidya metric (2.4) can be a correct description only to first order in L. In fact, deriving the surface gravity and luminosity from\n(2.4) the results differ from those for the improved Schwarzschild metric by terms due to the\nv-dependence of M. In our approximation those terms are neglected as they would contain\nadditional factors of \u1e40 = \u2212L.\nIII.\n\nAPPARENT HORIZON AND TIMELIKE LIMIT SURFACE\n\nNext we turn to the various horizon-like loci of the improved Vaidya metric. Regarded\nas 3-surfaces, all of them are histories of spherical 2-surfaces.\nThe apparent horizon is a marginally trapped surface. We determine it from the condition\nthat one of the congruences of radial null geodesics, in affine parametrization, has vanishing\nexpansion scalar there, \u0398 = 0. The improved Vaidya metric (2.4) has the structure\nds2 = [\u2212f (r, v)dv + 2dr]dv + r 2 d\u03a92\n\n(3.1)\n\nAlong outgoing radial null geodesics we have f dv = 2dr. Hence, parametrizing them as\n\u0001\nr = r(v), they obey the differential equation \u1e59(v) = f r(v), v /2 where the dot denotes a\nderivative with respect to v. We can rewrite this equation in the autonomous form\nd \u03bc\nx (\u03bb) = u\u03bc (x(\u03bb))\nd\u03bb\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith the null vector field\nu\u03bc \u2261 (uv , ur , u\u03b8 , u\u03c6 ) = (1,\n\n1\nf, 0, 0)\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nA short calculation reveals that the geodesic equation holds in the form u\u03bd D\u03bd u\u03bc = Ku\u03bc with\na nonzero function\n1\nK = \u2202r f\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nHence the parameter \u03bb in (3.2) is not an affine one. In order for the standard discussion\n[6, 47] to be applicable we must reexpress the null geodesics in terms of an affine parameter\n\n11\n\n\f\u03bb\u2217 . Given a solution x(\u03bb) of (3.2) we compute the function \u03bb\u2217 (\u03bb) by integrating\nd\n\u03bb\u2217 (\u03bb) = exp\nd\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03bb\u2032 K(x(\u03bb\u2032 ))\n\n(3.5)\n\nand determine its inverse \u03bb = \u03bb(\u03bb\u2217 ). Then we define x\u03bc\u2217 (\u03bb\u2217 ) \u2261 x\u03bc (\u03bb(\u03bb\u2217 )) which satisfies\nd \u03bc\nx (\u03bb\u2217 ) = n\u03bc (x\u2217 (\u03bb\u2217 ))\nd\u03bb\u2217 \u2217\n\n(3.6)\n\nn\u03bc (x) = e\u2212\u0393(x) u\u03bc (x)\n\n(3.7)\n\nHere\n\nis a new vector field, with \u0393(x) satisfying\nu\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u0393 = K\n\n(3.8)\n\nUsing (3.8) one easily verifies that n\u03bd D\u03bd n\u03bc = 0, implying that \u03bb\u2217 is an affine parameter [6].\nThe expansion scalar \u0398 which determines the location of the AH is the divergence of n\u03bc .\nUsing (3.8) we find\n\u0398 \u2261 D\u03bc n\u03bc = e\u2212\u0393 [D\u03bc u\u03bc \u2212 K].\n\n(3.9)\n\nFor f (r, v) = 1 \u2212 2G(r)M(v)/r we have\n1\n1\nD\u03bc u\u03bc = f + \u2202r f\nr\n2\n\n(3.10)\n\nTogether with (3.4) this yields the expansion scalar\n1\n\u0398 = e\u2212\u0393 f\nr\n\n(3.11)\n\nThis is the same result as for the classical Vaidya metric; the r-dependence of G did not\nlead to extra terms.\nEq.(3.11) tells us that \u0398 vanishes if, and only if, f vanishes. According to point a) of\nthe Introduction this is the case at r = r+ and r = r\u2212 with r\u00b1 defined by (1.7) with (1.8).\n(We assume that the r-dependence of G is given by (1.4) with \u03b3 = 0). Since r\u00b1 depends on\nM, it has become a function of the advanced time v now: r\u00b1 (v) \u2261 r\u00b1 (M(v)). Defined as\nthe outermost trapped surface, the AH is characterized by the implicit equation r = r+ (v)\nwhere, explicitly,\n\u03c9\ne\nr+ (v) =\nMcr\n\n\"\n\nM(v)\n+\nMcr\n12\n\ns\n\n\u0010 M(v) \u00112\nMcr\n\n#\n\n\u22121\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fFIG. 4: Light rays of the outgoing null congruence for M/Mcr = 2. The thick solid line is the\nEH determined numerically, the dashed lines are the outer and inner TLS=AH, and the thin solid\nlines are generic null rays, inside and outside the EH.\n\nThe second horizon surface, the TLS, is defined as the locus where the 4-velocity of\nstatic observers u\u03b1 \u221d \u03b4\u03c4\u03b1 becomes lightlike, with \u2202/\u2202\u03c4 a vector orthogonal to the r = const\nhypersurfaces. Since we consider a spherically symmetric spacetime, this vector is precisely\n\u2202/\u2202v and AH and TLS coincide in this case, being u\u03b1 u\u03b2 g\u03b1\u03b2 = gvv = \u2212f .\nStrictly speaking, apart from the outer AH r = r+ (v) there exists also an inner TLS=AH\nr = r\u2212 (v), at which the vector field \u2202/\u2202v switches back from spacelike to timelike.\n\n13\n\n\fIV.\n\nTHE EVENT HORIZON\n\nThe radial light rays r = r(v) of the outgoing null congruence are to be found by solving\nthe differential equation \u1e59(v) = f (r(v), v)/2, or explicitly,\ndr(v)\n2G(r(v))M(v) \u0011\n1\u0010\n1\u2212\n=\ndv\n2\nr(v)\n\n(4.1)\n\nDepending on their initial points, light rays can, or can not, escape to infinity for v \u2192 \u221e. By\ndefinition, the \"separatrix\" separating those two classes of solutions is the event horizon, the\noutermost locus traced by outgoing photons that can never reach arbitrarily large distances.\nIt is easy to understand why for a radiating (as opposed to an accreting) black hole the\nEH is inside the TLS. Inside (outside) the TLS, f is negative (positive), implying that the\n\u0001\nlight ray's r(v) decreases (increases) if r(v) < rTLS (v) r(v) > rTLS (v) . Under certain\nconditions it can happen that due to the hole's mass loss the radius of the TLS decreases\n\nfaster than r(v). As a result, the light ray intersects the TLS, with \u1e59 = 0 there, and then\nescapes from the hole with \u1e59 > 0.\nThe situation is illustrated in Fig.(4). The region between rEH and rTLS forms the hole's\n\"quantum ergosphere\" which owes its existence entirely to the evaporation process.\nClearly a determination of the EH's rEH (v) requires knowledge of M(v) for arbitrarily\nlate times v even. Therefore the semiclassical approximation is not sufficient to find the EH\nsince it breaks down for small M. As a way out, York [2, 3] proposed to replace the above\nrigorous definition of the EH by an approximate criterion which is local in v and does not\nrequire the \"teleological\" information about M(v) at late v. It is supposed to be valid for\nsmall L. In the following we analyze (4.1) both using the approximate criterion and the\nexact definition of the EH. Since we have an explicit prediction for the final stages of the\nevaporation process we are in a position to determine the EH exactly, and thus to assess the\nvalidity and precision of York's approximate \"working definition\".\nLet us begin with this working definition, applied to the RG improved spacetime. While\naccording to Eq.(4.1), the \"velocity\" \u1e59(v) is strictly negative inside the TLS, the acceleration\nr\u0308(v) can have either sign there. York proposes to approximately identify rEH (v) with the\nradius where the light ray's \"acceleration\" vanishes: r\u0308(EH) = 0. In pictorial terms one could\nthink of this condition as separating the light rays curving downward (r\u0308 < 0) from those\ncurving upward (r\u0308 > 0). Clearly the former (latter) are very unlikely (likely) to subsequently\n14\n\n\fr\n\nr TLS\n\nv\n\nv1\n\nFIG. 5: Light rays of the outging null congruence with r\u0308 > 0, r\u0308 = 0, and r\u0308 < 0 at v1 . Those with\nr\u0308 > 0 are most likely to eventually cross the TLS.\n\ncross the TLS, even if this is not a rigorous criterion, of course. (See Fig.(5) for a schematic\nsketch.) At least in the Hawking regime, photons are imprisoned by the approximate horizon\nfor times long compared to the dynamical time scale of the evaporating hole [2, 3].\nTaking a second v-derivative of (4.1) we obtain the \"acceleration\"\nr\u0308(v) = L(v)\n\nG(r)\n\u1e59\n\u1e59\n+ G(r)M(v) 2 \u2212 G\u2032 (r)M(v)\nr\nr\nr\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere we assumed that G(r) does not have a parametric dependence on M, which is actually\ntrue for \u03b3 = 0:\n\nG0 r 2\n(4.3)\nr2 + \u03c9\ne G0\n(For general \u03b3 there appears an additional term \u221d dG/dM in (4.2) which is irrelevant\nG(r) =\n\nqualitatively.) Eq.(4.2) tells us that, when r\u0308 = 0, the radius r, the velocity \u1e59, and the time\n\nv are related by\n\u1e59 = \u2212L G(r)\n\nSince rEH = rTLS\n\nh G(r)M(v)\n\n\u2032\n\ni\u22121\n\n\u2212 M(v)G (r)\n(4.4)\nr\nif the hole would not radiate, and since higher orders in the luminosity are\n\nneglected, the difference rTLS \u2212 rEH which we would like to compute is of order L. For this\nreason we may replace r \u2261 rEH on the RHS of (4.4) with rTLS = r+ (v), the error being of\n\norder L2 :\n\n\u1e59 = \u22122LG(r+ )\n\ni\u22121\nh 2G(r )M(v)\n\u22122LG(r+ )\n+\n\u2212 2M(v)G\u2032 (r+ )\n=\nr+\n[1 \u2212 2M(v)G\u2032 (r+ )]\n15\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fIn the second equality of (4.5) we used that 2G(r+ )M = r+ which follows from f (r+ ) = 0.\nEq.(4.5) provides us with the \"velocity\" \u1e59 at the point where the acceleration vanishes.\nThe corresponding coordinate, rEH , is the approximate location of the EH. We obtain it\nby using \u1e59 = f (r)/2 in order to rewrite the LHS of (4.5) in the form f (rEH )/2, and then\ninverting the function f . This inversion is easy to perform since, again, we may expand in\nrEH \u2212 r+ = O(L):\n\nf (rEH ) = f (r+ ) + (rEH \u2212 r+ )f \u2032 (r+ ) + O(L2 ).\n\nHence, to order L, \u1e59(EH) = (rEH \u2212 r+ )f \u2032 (r+ )/2 which yields, together with (4.5),\nrEH = r+ \u2212\n\n4LG(r+ )\nf \u2032 (r+ )[1 \u2212 2MG\u2032 (r+ )]\n\n(4.6)\n\nDifferentiating f (r) = 1 \u2212 2G(r)M/r and using 2G(r+ )M = r+ one obtains the relation\n\nf \u2032 (r+ ) = [1\u22122MG\u2032 (r+ )]/r+ . This leads to the following explicit formula for the v-dependence\nof rEH :\n\n(\n\n4 L(v) G(r+ (v))\nrEH (v) = r+ (v) 1 \u2212\n[1 \u2212 2 M(v) G\u2032 (r+ (v))]2\n\n)\n\n(4.7)\n\nEq.(4.7) is valid for an arbitrary r-dependence of G, still. If G = const we recover York's\nresult rEH = r+ [1 \u2212 4G0 L] with r+ = 2G0 M.\nLet us now specialize for the function G(r) motivated by quantum gravity, Eq.(4.3).\nThis r-dependence of Newton's constant implies that, at the TLS, G(r+ ) = r+ /(2M) and\n2\nG\u2032 (r+ ) = \u03c9\ne /(2M 2 r+ ). These equations were simplified using the relation r+\n+\u03c9\ne G0 =\n\n2G0 Mr+ which is equivalent to f (r+ ) = 0 with (4.3).

This behavior can be seen in Fig.(6).\nAs we anticipated, we now see that rEH is indeed smaller than r+ during the entire evap-\n\noration process, the EH is inside the (outer) TLS, thus giving rise to a quantum ergosphere.\n\nIt is an important observation that, while rEH is smaller than r+ , it is always larger\n17\n\n\fthan r\u2212 , provided the radiation effects are small compared to the quantum gravity effects\nin an appropriate sense. Comparing the radius (4.9) to r\u2212 as given by (1.7) we find that\nrEH (M) > r\u2212 (M) provided\n\u03c3\n1\n< \u221a\n3\n(4\u03c0) \u03c9\ne\n\u03a9 1\u2212\u03a9\n\n(4.10)\n\n\u221a\nFor 0 \u2264 \u03a9 \u2264 1 the RHS of (4.10) is bounded below by the constant 3 3/2. As a result, rEH\nis larger than r\u2212 during the entire evaporation process provided\n\u03c3<\n\n3\u221a\ne\n3(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\n2\n\n(4.11)\n\nIf (4.11) is satisfied, we have r+ (v) > rEH (v) > r\u2212 (v) for any finite v, and the EH touches\nboth the outer and the inner TLS only in the limit v \u2192 \u221e where r+ , rEH , r\u2212 \u2192 rcr .\nIf (4.11) is violated our method is inapplicable, most probably, and the improved Vaidya\nmetric is not a reliable description of the spacetime structure. This metric is valid to first\norder in L only, which means that the dimensionless luminosity has to be much smaller than\nunity, G0 L \u226a 1. If so, Eq.(1.10) implies \u03c3/[(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\ne ] \u226a 1, and (4.11) is indeed satisfied.\n\n(Note that Mcr2 /e\n\u03c9 2 = G\u22121\n\u03c9 .) It is reassuring to see that, for pure gravity, Eq.(4.11) is\n0 /e\nfulfilled with a very broad margin; the expansion parameter \u03c3/[(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\ne ] assumes the tiny\n\nvalue 8.3 * 10\u22125/\u03c9\u0303 in this case, with \u03c9\u0303 = O(1).\n\nLet us return to the exact definition of the EH now. We compute it for our model by\n\nnumerically solving (4.1) for a set of initial conditions r(0). For a certain range of r(0)'s\nthe trajectories will ultimately cross the TLS and escape to infinity, while the others remain\nat radii below rTLS for arbitrarily late advanced times. The light ray separating those two\nclasses of solutions defines the EH, a null hypersurface by construction.\nIn Fig.(4) we show various trajectories of either class, as well as the EH, determined\nnumerically from its exact definition. We have numerically evolved several initial conditions\nr(0) in order to determine the boundary between trapped and escaping null geodesics in\nthe limit v \u2192 \u221e. In Fig.(6) the true EH is compared to the prediction of York's criterion.\nObviously the latter provides a rather accurate approximation to the true horizon.\nThe global structure of the spacetime is depicted in the conformal diagram in Fig.(7).\nRegion I is a flat spacetime, while at V = V0 (V is the Kruskal advanced time coordinate,\ndefined as V = \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03bav) being \u03ba the surface gravity of the outer horizon) an imploding\nnull shell is present (strictly speaking it must have a negative tension in order to balance\nthe flux of negative energy on its future side [48]). Region II is the evaporating black hole\n18\n\n\fC\n\nH\nr=0\n\nJ+\nA\n\nE\n\nII\n\nr=0\n\nV= V0\n\nI\nJ\n\n\u2212\n\nFIG. 7: The conformal diagram of the evaporating quantum black hole: region I is a flat spacetime,\nand region II is the evaporating BH spacetime, EH is the event horizon, CH is the inner (Cauchy)\nhorizon, and A is the apparent horizon.\n\nspacetime. The AH is a timelike hypersurface which \"meets\" the EH at future null infinity in\nthe conformal diagram. The null ray which is tangent to the earliest portion of the apparent\nhorizon A would have been the EH if the hole were not radiating. The final state of the\nblack hole is an extremal black hole whose inner and outer horizons have the same radius\n(r = rcr ) and are located at the event horizon EH and the inner (Cauchy) horizon CH in\nFig.(7).\nIt is instructive to compare the areas A of the various horizons. They are defined\nby intersecting the EH, AH, and TLS with the incoming null surfaces v = const. Thus\nATLS (v) = 4\u03c0r+ (v)2 and AEH (v) = 4\u03c0rEH (v)2 . From Eq.(1.7) we obtain for ATLS \u2261 AAH\ni2\nh\np\nATLS = 4\u03c0G20 M 2 1 + 1 \u2212 (Mcr /M)2\n\n(4.12)\n\nand the approximate result (4.9a) for the event horizon implies\nh\nAEH = ATLS 1 \u2212\n\n\u03a9(1 \u2212 \u03a9) i\n4\u03c3\n\u221a\n(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\ne1+ 1\u2212\u03a9\n\n19\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fwhere a term of second order in \u03c3/(4\u03c0)3 \u03c9\ne has been neglected. The difference \u03b4A \u2261 ATLS \u2212\nAEH is given by\n\n\u03b4A =\n\n\u221a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3 2\nl\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03a9)\n1\n+\n1\n\u2212\n\u03a9\nPl\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(4.14)\n\n2\nDuring the early stages of the evaporation process, \u03b4A \u2248 \u03c3lPl\n/(2\u03c0 2 ) = 128\u03c0Bl2Pl which\n\ncoincides with the known result [2] for the Hawking regime, while \u03b4A vanishes proportional\nto (M 2 \u2212 Mcr2 ) \u2192 0 for v \u2192 \u221e. It had been emphasized by York [2, 3] that in the Hawking\nregime he considered, \u03b4A is a universal (i.e. M independent) quantity which depends only\non \u03c3, thus counting the degrees of freedom of the field quanta which can be evaporated off.\nLooking at Eq.(4.14) we see that this universality does not persist beyond the semiclassical\napproximation.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe renormalization group improvement of black hole spacetimes according to Quantum\nEinstein Gravity leads to concrete predictions on the final state of the evaporation process.\nUnlike previous studies based on ad hoc modifications of the equation of state of matter at\nvery high (Planckian) densities [49, 50, 51], or models based on loop quantum gravity [52],\n\u221a\ne lPl . Its precise value is\nthe mass of the remnant can be calculated explicitly: Mcr = \u03c9\n\ndetermined by the value of \u03c9\ne which is a measurable quantity in principle [53]. No naked\n\nsingularity forms, at variance with the paradigm proposed in [44, 51], so that the remnant is\na mini-black hole of Planckian size. On the other hand, it is intriguing to note that exactly\nsolvable semiclassical gravity-dilaton models predict a final state described by an extremal\nconfiguration which is reached in an infinite amount of time [54]. (See also [55] and [56] for\nanalogous semiclassical models, and [57, 58] for an approach based on special resummations\nof higher order graviton loops. )\nIt would be interesting to investigate the possible astrophysical implications of a population of stable Planck size mini-black holes produced in the Early Universe or by the\ninteraction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium [59, 60]. We hope to address these\nissues in a subsequent publication.\n\n20\n\n\fVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Werner Israel for helpful suggestions on an earlier version of this\nmanuscript.
