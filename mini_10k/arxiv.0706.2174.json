Introduction\nMore than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered over the\npast decade, revealing a completely unexpected diversity in the\nproperties of planetary systems (Udry et al. 2007). Models of\nplanet formation had to be largely revised to explain a number of characteristics derived from the observations such as the\nplanet-metallicity correlation, orbital migration, and the occurrence of high eccentricities. Increasingly complex models including Monte Carlo simulations are being developed by different groups (e.g. Ida & Lin 2004; Alibert et al. 2005) with the\ngoal of comparing theoretical predictions to the observed distribution of extrasolar planets.\nBesides metallicity, protoplanetary disk masses and surface\ndensities are other important factors suspected to strongly influence the formation of giant planets. They are thought to\nbe dependent on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive\nstars will have more massive disks and higher surface densities (see Ida & Lin 2005), although this point needs confirmation. The exact impact of this on planet formation is presently\npoorly known theoretically but the favoured core-accretion scenario predicts that massive giant planets should form more freSend offprint requests to: C.

This is also supported\nby observational data showing that giant planets are much rarer\naround M dwarfs than around solar-type stars (Bonfils et al.\n2005; Endl et al. 2006; Butler et al. 2006).\nIn this context, it is of great interest to investigate the frequency of giant planets around stars significantly more massive\nthan the Sun. Unfortunately, it is impossible to apply usual highprecision Doppler techniques to stars with spectral types earlier than late-F due to the increase in rotational velocities and\nthe low number of spectral lines in these stars. A few attempts\nhave been made, however, to adapt the technique to A\u2013F stars\n(Galland et al. 2005), unveiling a brown dwarf candidate around\na 1.7 M\u2299 primary (Galland et al. 2006).\nAnother promising approach is to study intermediate-mass\nstars in a more evolved stage, i.e. in the red giant phase, where\nrotational velocities are low and many spectral lines are available for Doppler shift measurements. However, great care has\nto be taken when interpreting RV variations in red giants due\nto the presence of intrinsic stellar jitter. Precise RV measurements have already been reported for many red giants in the solar neighbourhood, and a few planet candidates have been discovered around such stars (Frink et al. 2002; Hatzes et al. 2003,\n2005, 2006; Setiawan et al. 2003, 2005; Sato et al. 2003). These\ndetections demonstrate that in these cases stellar jitter does not\nhide the RV signal of giant planets. It appears that a significant\n\n\f2\n\nC. Lovis and M. Mayor: Planets around evolved intermediate-mass stars\n\nfraction of red giants are indeed suitable for planet search, provided they are chosen not too evolved or too cool (Sato et al.\n2005).\nIn the context of planet formation around intermediate-mass\nstars, it is crucial to have a precise knowledge of primary masses.\nThis is unfortunately very difficult for field red giants such as\nthose mentioned above, due to the degeneracy of evolutionary\ntracks in the HR diagram. Error bars on the stellar mass are often\nof the order \u00b12M\u2299 , making it impossible to determine whether\nthe star under consideration has a mass around 1 M\u2299 or significantly higher.\nTo overcome this difficulty we started a high-precision radial\nvelocity survey of red giant stars in a number of intermediateage open clusters. Knowledge of cluster parameters allows us\nto accurately determine red giant masses, which we choose between 1.5 and 4 M\u2299 . We obtained first measurements in 2003\nwith the Coralie spectrograph (Queloz et al. 2000) at the Swiss1.2m Euler telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile. However,\nthe faintness of our targets prevented us from observing all\nof the clusters with Coralie and led us to apply for observing\ntime on a more powerful instrument, the HARPS spectrograph\n(Mayor et al. 2003) on the ESO-3.6m telescope, also at La Silla.\nThis allowed us to reach a sufficient RV precision on the faintest\nred giants (V \u001b 12) in our sample.\nVery recently, following a strategy similar to ours, Sato et al.\n(2007) published the discovery of a giant planet orbiting a\n2.7 M\u2299 red giant in the Hyades. This illustrates the potential\nof open clusters as laboratories to understand planet formation.\nIn this paper we present the discoveries of a massive planet and\na brown dwarf around two intermediate-mass stars in our clusters, NGC2423 No3 (TYC 5409-2156-1) and NGC4349 No127\n(TYC 8975-2606-1). Sect. 2 describes the sample of stars we are\nfollowing in our RV survey. The basic properties of both planethost stars are discussed in Sect. 3, whereas Sect. 4 presents the\nRV measurements and orbital solutions for both companions. In\nSect. 5 we show that the RV variations are not due to spurious\nstellar effects. Finally, we discuss the implications of these discoveries in the broader context of planet formation in Sect. 6.\n\n2. Description of the survey\nThe clusters in our survey have been selected based on a number of criteria. First of all, to have giant masses between 1.5 and\n4 M\u2299 , they have to be of intermediate age (0.2\u20132 Gyr). They also\nhave to be observable with Coralie and HARPS, so we set a declination limit \u03b4 \u2264 +15\u25e6. Moreover, to reach a sufficient photonlimited RV precision (\u226410 m s\u22121 ), their giants must be brighter\nthan V = 10 for Coralie and V = 13 for HARPS. Finally, we\nonly took into account clusters having more than 3 giants known\nto be non-binary cluster members.\nTable 1 gives the list of all selected clusters with their\nmain properties. Cluster ages and data on their red giants\nhave been taken from the WEBDA database (Mermilliod 1995;\nMermilliod & Paunzen 2003). The mass of the red giants in\nthese clusters was derived from their ages using the Padova stellar evolution models at solar metallicity (Girardi et al. 2000).\nError bars on the masses have been estimated taking into account the uncertainties on the cluster ages and metallicities. The\nassumption of solar metallicity is not likely to cause large errors on the derived masses since the metallicity distribution of\nopen clusters in the solar neighbourhood shows a peak at solar\nmetallicity and a small scatter of \u223c0.1 dex (Twarog et al. 1997).\nThe determination of precise cluster metallicities is a challenging task and the values found in the literature for a given clus-\n\nter are sometimes quite different. This is especially problematic\nfor planet searches since we would like to distinguish between\ntwo effects, the well-known planet-metallicity correlation and\nthe influence of stellar mass on planet formation. For this reason we are planning to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of the\ngiants in our sample in order to perform a high-precision spectroscopic analysis and determine metallicities in the same way\nas for nearby field stars (Santos et al. 2004; Valenti & Fischer\n2005; da Silva et al. 2006).\n\n3. Parent star characteristics\n3.1. NGC2423 No3\n\nOur sample contains 6 giants belonging to NGC 2423 (distance\nd = 766 pc). With an age of \u223c750 Myr, these stars have an estimated mass of 2.4 \u00b1 0.2M\u2299 . The metallicicty given in WEBDA\nfor this cluster is [Fe/H] = 0.14 \u00b1 0.09 (from Twarog et al. 1997).\nWe verified that all 6 stars are indeed cluster members by checking their position in the HR diagram and their radial velocities.\nFig. 1 shows the HR diagram of NGC 2423 as given by WEBDA\nwith the position of our 6 survey stars. All are situated in or\nclose to the red clump. NGC2423 No3 (\u03b1 = 07h37m09s, \u03b4 = 13\u25e6 54\u2032 24\u2032\u2032 ) has visual magnitude V = 9.45 and colour index\nB \u2212 V = 1.21 according to Hassan (1976). It appears to be somewhat redder and brighter than the mean clump position, indicating that it might be slightly more evolved. However, the small\nnumber of red giants in the cluster and the uncertainties in the\nphotometry make it difficult to draw a clear conclusion on its\nprecise evolutionary stage. Regarding radial velocities, we computed from our Coralie measurements a mean radial velocity for\nthe red clump of 18.67 km s\u22121 , with a dispersion of 0.34 km s\u22121 .\nThe mean RV of NGC2423 No3 is 18.32 km s\u22121 , leading to a\nhigh probability that it is indeed a cluster member.\nWe started the monitoring of the NGC 2423 giants with\nCoralie in 2003 and accumulated \u223c10 RV measurements per star,\nspread over more than 2 years. The average visual magnitude\nof these stars, V = 10.5, makes them difficult targets for precision RV measurements with this instrument. Nevertheless we\ncould obtain a typical photon-limited RV precision of \u223c15 m s\u22121 ,\nsufficient to detect giant planets. Fig. 2 shows the histogram\nof the RV dispersion for the NGC 2423 giants after correction of the instrumental contribution. Four of them exhibit\na RV scatter below 30 m s\u22121 , while NGC2423 No3 stands\nclearly out with its RV dispersion of 72 m s\u22121 . Finally, the last\nstar (NGC2423 No43) shows a large-amplitude, long-term drift\n(\u03c3RV = 542 m s\u22121 ) due to a stellar-mass companion recently discovered by Mermilliod et al. (2007).\nThese results allow us to compute an estimate of the typical\nRV jitter affecting the NGC 2423 giants. Quadratically subtracting the instrumental contribution, we obtain a value of \u223c20 m s\u22121\nfor the jitter, based on the 4 stable stars in this cluster. It therefore\nappears that the jitter level will not prevent us from detecting the\nRV signal of giant planets orbiting these stars.\n3.2. NGC4349 No127\n\nNGC 4349 is a distant open cluster (d = 2200 pc) with an age of\nonly 200 Myr. The best available estimate for the metallicity is\n[Fe/H] = -0.12 \u00b1 0.04 (Piatti et al. 1995). This is one of the most\ninteresting clusters in our sample since its giant stars have an estimated mass of 3.9 \u00b1 0.3M\u2299.

Using the stable giants,\nwe derive an estimated jitter level of 20 m s\u22121 , very similar to the\nNGC 2423 giants. Most interestingly, the high-mass NGC 4349\nstars are therefore suitable for planet search with precise radial\nvelocities.\nFig. 1. Colour-magnitude diagram for NGC 2423 taken from\nWEBDA.

NGC2423 No3\n\nmagnitude V = 10.88 and colour index B \u2212 V = 1.46 according\nto Lohmann (1961). Again, it seems to be slightly more evolved\nthan the mean clump position. The mean radial velocity of the\ngiants, derived from our measurements, is -11.77 km s\u22121 , with\na dispersion of 0.23 km s\u22121 . The mean RV of NGC4349 No127\nis -11.40 km s\u22121 ; this star is therefore most probably a cluster\nmember.\nWe use HARPS to observe the NGC 4349 giants since they\nare too faint for Coralie (V \u001b 11.3). To date we have obtained\nabout 7 measurements per star spanning \u223c500 days. The typical photon-limited RV precision on these stars amounts to 3\u2013\n4 m s\u22121 . Fig. 2 shows the histogram of the RV dispersion after subtraction of the instrumental component. Four stars have\na moderate scatter of 13\u201328 m s\u22121 , while NGC4349 No168\nshows a long-term trend (\u03c3RV = 74 m s\u22121 ) probably due to a\nstellar companion. Finally, NGC4349 No203 is a short-period\nbinary exhibiting large RV variations (Mermilliod et al. 2007).\n\nWe obtained a total of 46 data points for NGC2423 No3 (28 with\nCoralie and 18 with HARPS) over a time span of 1529 days.\nTables 2 and 3 give the list of these measurements with their\ninstrumental error bars. These radial velocities have been computed using the standard Coralie and HARPS pipelines. As can\nbe seen, HARPS measurements are of much higher quality than\nCoralie ones. However, in this case the true uncertainties on the\nstellar radial velocity are dominated by stellar jitter, which we\nhave estimated to \u223c20 m s\u22121 in Sect. 3. In the following we\ntherefore quadratically add this value to the instrumental error to\nobtain the final error bar. To combine both data sets, we consider\nHARPS and Coralie as two independent instruments, i.e. we introduce an RV offset between both instruments as a free parameter when fitting a model to the combined data. We note that the\nHARPS-Coralie offset cannot be pre-determined once for good,\nsince it depends on the star under consideration, the correlation\nmasks used, etc. In the case of NGC2423 No3, the offset is par-\n\n\f4\n\nC.

As for NGC2423 No3, a jitter\nof 20 m s\u22121 was quadratically added to the instrumental error\nbars. Assuming the observed RV variations are due to an orbiting\nbody, we fit a Keplerian orbit to the data, which yields an orbital\nperiod P = 678 days, an eccentricity e = 0.19 and a RV semiamplitude K = 188 m s\u22121 . This corresponds to a minimum mass\nm2 sin i = 19.8 MJup and a semi-major axis a = 2.38 AU for the\ncompanion (see Table 5). The RMS of the residuals is 12.6 m s\u22121\nand the reduced \u03c72 0.52. This unreasonably good value probably\nindicates that stellar jitter was also overestimated in this case. If\nthis RV signal is indeed caused by an orbiting body (as suggested\nin Sect. 5), then the companion around NGC4349 No127 has a\nmass above the D-burning threshold and should therefore be referred to as a brown dwarf according to current definitions. Such\nobjects are extremely rare around solar-type stars, and it is therefore remarkable to have detected one among a relatively small\nsample of intermediate-mass stars (see discussion in Sect. 6).\n\n5. Line shape and activity analysis\nIt is always necessary to carefully analyze RV measurements of\ngiant stars since the RV jitter affecting these stars may induce\na signal that could be misinterpreted as a planet. The dependence of RV variability on stellar parameters (mass, metallicity,\nevolutionary stage) is poorly known for giant stars. However,\nthere are indications that clump red giants (i.e. in the core Heburning phase) are intrinsically more stable than first-ascent\nRGB or AGB stars (Bizyaev et al. 2006). Short-period (hours to\ndays) and long-term (hundreds of days) RV variations have been\nknown to exist in giant stars for many years (see Walker et al.\n1989; Larson et al. 1993; Hatzes & Cochran 1993, 1994). While\nthe short-period modulations are most probably due to stellar\npulsations (e.g. solar-like oscillations, see Frandsen et al. 2002;\nde Ridder et al. 2006; Hekker et al. 2006), three main reasons\nmay explain the long-term variations: the presence of an orbiting body, rotational modulations of surface features and longperiod, non-radial oscillation modes. To distinguish between\n\nFig. 5. Radial velocity curve as a function of time for\nNGC4349 No127. The fitted orbit corresponds to a companion\nwith a minimum mass of 19.8 MJup and a period of 678 days.\nthese hypotheses, we use two well-known diagnostics, the bisector velocity span of the cross-correlation function (Hatzes 1996;\nQueloz et al. 2001) and the CaII H&K activity index (S-index).\nThe bisector span traces line shape variations and should remain\nconstant if the measured RVs are due to an orbiting body, while\nthe S-index is sensitive to active regions on the stellar surface.\nIn the case of rotational modulations, these indicators should exhibit variations in phase with the radial velocities and the stellar\nrotation period. The rotation period is however difficult to estimate in our case because relevant parameters such as the stellar\nradius, the projected rotational velocity, the inclination angle and\npossible photometric variability are either not known or too uncertain. We therefore rely on the study of bisector and S-index\nmeasurements to trace inhomogeneities at the stellar surface.\nFinally, long-period, non-radial oscillations in G and K giants\ncannot be excluded but are presently rather hypothetical since\nthey have never been unambiguously identified and lack a clear\ntheoretical support. If present, such oscillation modes should\nhave an effect on the bisector velocity span, although there may\nbe cases where this signature is difficult to measure (see for example Hatzes & Cochran 1999, for a detailed discussion).\nFig. 6 shows the spectrum of NGC2423 No3 and\nNGC4349 No127 in the CaII H region. Although the signal-tonoise ratio is low due to the faintness of the stars, no re-emission\nfeatures are visible in the CaII H line core. This suggests a low\nlevel of activity in these giant stars. To compute the CaII S-index,\nwe closely follow the procedure originally used at Mount Wilson\n(Vaughan et al. 1978), i.e. the fluxes in two narrow bandpasses\n(1 \u00c5) centered on the CaII H&K cores are integrated and then\nnormalized with the integrated flux in two neighbouring spectral\nbands. Given the low signal-to-noise ratio, we carefully checked\nthat our measurements and error bars are correct. We made sure\nthat the random errors (photon and detector noise) are properly propagated and checked that no instrumental effects, such\nas background light pollution, have a significant impact on the\ncomputed S-index values. The error bars indicate that we are\nable to measure CaII flux variations at the 10\u201320% level.\nFig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the radial velocity, bisector span and\nS-index for NGC2423 No3 and NGC4349 No127 as a function\nof orbital phase.

As can\nbe seen for both stars, the bisector span shows no correlation\nwith the RV variations. HARPS bisector measurements have dispersions of 3.7 and 12.0 m s\u22121 respectively for NGC2423 No3\nand NGC4349 No127, which is about one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the RV variations. Similarly, the S-index does not\nvary in phase with the RVs (although it shows some variations\nin the case of NGC4349 No127). To further study the behaviour\nof the bisector span and the S-index, we computed the LombScargle periodograms of these two quantities, shown in Fig. 9\nand Fig. 10. To assess the significance of the peaks, we performed Monte-Carlo simulations to compute their false-alarm\nprobabilities (FAPs).

Finally, we also stress that\nthe two stars under consideration are the only ones in their respective clusters showing such a strong RV signal, despite the\nfact that the other clump giants have similar masses, metallicities and evolutionary status. Altogether, this leads to the conclusion that the planetary hypothesis is the best explanation for the\nobserved, large-amplitude RV variations.\n\n6. Discussion and conclusion\n6.1. About planets in open clusters\n\nOpen clusters naturally form homogeneous samples of stars with\nwell-constrained basic properties such as mass, metallicity and\nage. As a consequence, searching for planets in open cluster\n\n\fC. Lovis and M. Mayor: Planets around evolved intermediate-mass stars\n\nFig. 8.

As an example,\nthe NGC4349 No127 system is extreme under two aspects: it is\nthe heaviest star (with an accurate mass determination) around\nwhich a substellar companion has been detected to date, and it\nis one of the youngest systems known so far. Its age of 200 Myr\nrepresents an upper limit for the timescale of giant planet/brown\ndwarf formation in the inner regions (a few AUs) surrounding\nintermediate-mass stars.\nWith the recent discovery by Sato et al. (2007), we now have\n3 massive planets or brown dwarfs orbiting intermediate-mass\nstars in open clusters. This is most probably only the beginning.\nOur ongoing survey is not complete yet and we plan to extend it\nto other clusters to increase the significance of statistical analyses. A detailed description of the global results from our survey\nis beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere. Incidentally, we also stress the importance of searching\nfor planets around FGK dwarfs in open clusters. However, two\nmain problems make such a project difficult: the faintness of the\ntargets (most clusters have FGK dwarfs fainter than V = 14),\nand stellar activity for clusters younger than \u223c1 Gyr (see for\nexample the RV survey in the Hyades by Paulson et al. 2004).\nNevertheless, future high-precision spectrographs installed on\n8\u201310m telescopes and next-generation ELTs should be able to\ncarry out RV surveys in a large sample of clusters, thereby\npermitting large-scale comparisons between stars of different\nmasses and metallicities.\nThere have been a number of studies on the impact\nof cluster environment on planet formation (see for example Armitage 2000; Scally & Clarke 2001; Bonnell et al. 2001;\nSmith & Bonnell 2001; Malmberg et al. 2007).

Little is presently known about the overall magnitude\nof these effects. Future discoveries of planets in open clusters\nwill help put some constraints on these issues.\n6.2. Planet properties as a function of stellar mass\n\nAlthough the sample of intermediate-mass stars being searched\nfor exoplanets is still limited, we can already try to derive some\nfundamental trends in the characteristics of planetary systems as\na function of stellar mass. In particular we would like to compute estimates of the giant planet frequency and typical mass of\nplanetary systems for different categories of stellar masses. In\nthe following we consider three bins of stellar masses, equally\nspaced on a logarithmic scale: 0.18 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 0.56 (mostly\nM dwarfs), 0.56 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 1.78 (mostly FGK dwarfs) and\n1.78 \u2264 M/M\u2299 \u2264 5.62 (intermediate-mass red giants). Precise\nRV surveys targeting the first two bins have been ongoing for\nmore than a decade and have yielded reliable estimates of giant planet frequency around solar-type stars (Udry et al. 2007;\nMarcy et al. 2006) and M dwarfs (Bonfils et al. 2006; Endl et al.\n2006; Butler et al. 2006). For the third bin only preliminary results are available, but they seem to show an abnormal number\nof massive planets or brown dwarfs compared to the other bins,\nwhere this kind of objects are extremely rare (\"brown dwarf\ndesert\"). To quantify this more precisely, we have to define a\nregion in the parameter space of planetary properties where observational biases will not strongly affect the results. In this respect the limiting bin is obviously the category of intermediatemass stars because of the short duration of the surveys and the\nincreased detection limits due to higher stellar masses and RV\njitter. We therefore choose to focus on massive planets with\nM > 5 MJup located at orbital distances 0.5 AU \u2264 a \u2264 2.5 AU.\nSuch planets will always induce RV semi-amplitudes larger than\n45 m s\u22121 on periods shorter than 3 years, and should therefore\nbe detectable with \u223c100% probability by ongoing RV surveys.\nWe also set a minimal semi-major axis at a = 0.5 AU because\nintermediate-mass red giants will have engulfed closer-in planets during their evolution along the RGB. Obviously, this is only\na rough estimate since the true minimal semi-major axis at which\na planet can survive during the RGB phase depends on the detailed stellar structure and system properties.\nWe now have to estimate for each bin how many stars have\nbeen sufficiently observed by RV surveys to reveal massive\nplanets orbiting them. For M dwarfs, we estimate that about\n300 stars meet this criterium if we take into account the highprecision surveys carried out by the HARPS and Elodie teams\n(Bonfils et al. 2006), the California-Carnegie team (Butler et al.\n2006) and the Texas team (Endl et al. 2006). For FGK dwarfs,\nthe total number of stars followed by the different groups over\nthe past decade amounts to about 3000. For intermediate-mass\nstars, adding our survey to the ones carried out by Sato et al.\n(2003) and Setiawan et al. (2004) leads us to about 200 targets with a mass higher than \u223c1.8 M\u2299 . Again, these numbers\nare only rough estimates, but they should nevertheless be correct enough for a qualitative analysis. Other surveys targeting\nintermediate-mass stars have recently yielded their first results\n(e.g. Johnson et al. 2007) and should be included in future analyses.\nAs an input database for exoplanets, we use the Extrasolar\nPlanets Encyclopaedia maintained by J. Schneider1 as of\n1\n\nhttp://exoplanet.eu\n\nFig. 11. Average mass of planetary systems as a function of\nstellar mass, taking into account all planets known as of\nFebruary 2007 (see text for details). More massive stars seem\nto harbour more massive planetary systems.\n\nFebruary 2007. We made two modifications to this database.\nFirst, we removed the few close binary stellar systems since\nplanets in such systems probably have quite different properties (Eggenberger et al. 2004). Second, we added to the list a\nfew brown dwarf candidates that were not included since their\nminimum masses are significantly higher than 13 MJup . It is necessary to take such objects into account since we want an unbiased census of massive planets and brown dwarfs. However, we\nhad to define an upper mass limit to avoid including objects in\nthe tail of the mass distribution of stellar companions, since we\nare primarily interested in the distribution of \"planetary\" companions, to the left of the brown dwarf desert. We put the limit\nat M = 40 MJup (in the middle of the desert), which led us to\nadd 3 objects to the database (HD 137510b, HD 180777b and\nHD 184860b). We note that the exact value of the cut-off mass\nhas no significant impact on the results because of the rarity of\nbrown dwarfs.\nWe can now compute for each stellar mass bin the frequency of planets and brown dwarfs in the mass and semimajor axis ranges defined above. For M dwarfs, there are no detected planets meeting the criteria. For solar-type stars, there are\n14 planets out of 3000 stars (0.5%), while for intermediate-mass\nstars 5 planets have been detected among 200 targets (2.5%).\nAssuming the true planet frequency is the same for higher-mass\nstars as for solar-type stars (i.e. 0.5%), there is only a 0.3% probability to find 5 planets out of 200 intermediate-mass stars. Even\nif these values are derived from small-number statistics, there\nseems to be a real trend in the sense that more massive stars\nform significantly more massive planets or brown dwarfs than\nlower-mass stars.\nAlternatively, we can also compute for each bin the average\nmass of planetary systems, i.e. the total mass of all planets divided by the total number of stars in each bin. We choose this\nindicator because it gives useful information on the output of\n\n\fC. Lovis and M. Mayor: Planets around evolved intermediate-mass stars\n\nthe planet formation process (total mass accreted into planetary\nbodies) and it is relatively free of observational biases. On the\none hand, it seems reasonable to assume that most of the mass\nin planetary systems is contained in the few largest bodies of\neach system. On the other hand, RV surveys are most sensitive\nto massive planets. We should then be able to obtain reasonable\nestimates for the average planetary system mass in the first two\nbins, while this quantity will probably be underestimated in the\nthird bin due to the short duration and the lower sensitivity of the\nsurveys. Fig. 11 shows the results in a histogram, which suggests\nthat more massive stars do form more massive planetary systems\nthan lower-mass stars, in spite of the previously mentioned observational biases. If confirmed, this mass scaling raises questions on how to classify objects above 13 MJup orbiting solartype and intermediate-mass stars. An abrupt transition between\nplanets and brown dwarfs would have little meaning if both categories of objects are formed by the same physical process.\nSuch a scaling in the mass distribution of exoplanets is expected in the core-accretion scenario of planet formation since\nmore massive stars probably have more massive disks, which\nmake it possible to accrete larger amounts of rock, ice and\ngas. However, more quantitative studies are needed. In the diskinstability paradigm (e.g. Boss 2006), it is not clear how planet\nformation depends on stellar mass in general, although Boss\n(2006) predicts that this mechanism should not be too sensitive\nto this parameter. It also remains to be seen if high luminosities\nand winds will not prevent the formation of gas giants in the inner regions surrounding intermediate-mass stars. As an example,\nIda & Lin (2005) predict that the location of the ice boundary at\nlarger distances is likely to make the formation process of gas\ngiants less efficient. They even predict that the fraction of stars\nharbouring giant planets should decrease beyond 1 M\u2299 , which is\nin contradiction with the results presented in this paper (at least\nfor planets heavier than 5 MJup ). The apparently high frequency\nof massive planets around intermediate-mass stars indeed suggests a rather higher efficiency for the accretion process.\nAcknowledgements.
