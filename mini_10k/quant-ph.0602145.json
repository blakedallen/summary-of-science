KIEU\nAbstract. We study a set of truncated matrices, given by Smith [8], in connection to an\nidentification criterion for the ground state in our proposed quantum adiabatic algorithm for\nHilbert's tenth problem. We identify the origin of the trouble for this truncated example and\nshow that for a suitable choice of some parameter it can always be removed.

It is maintained\nthat the criterion, in general, should be applicable provided certain conditions are satisfied. We\nalso point out that, apart from this one, other criteria serving the same identification purpose\nmay also be available.\n\nIn a proposal of a quantum adiabatic algorithm for Hilbert's tenth problem [5], we employ an\nadiabatic process with a time-dependent Hamiltonian\n(1)\n\nH(t)\n\n= (1 \u2212 t/T )HI + (t/T )HP .\n\nHere t is time and this Hamiltonian metamorphoses from HI when t = 0 to HP when t = T . The\nfinal Hamiltonian HP encodes the Diophantine equation in consideration, while the initial HI is\nuniversal and independent of the Diophantine equation, except only on its number of variables K.\nThe process is captured by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(2)\n\n\u2202t |\u03c8(t)i\n|\u03c8(0)i\n\n= \u2212iH(t)|\u03c8(t)i,\n\n= |{\u03b1}i,\n\nwhere |{\u03b1}i is the ground state of the initial infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian HI , which we choose\nto be\nK\nX\n(3)\n(a\u2020i \u2212 \u03b1\u2217i )(ai \u2212 \u03b1i ).\nHI =\ni=1\n\nThis choice is not unique, but with it, |{\u03b1}i is then the Cartesian product, of K factors, of the\nwell-known coherent states in quantum physics.\nIn order to identify the ground state at the final time t = T , we have shown in the case of\n2\n2-dimensional spaces [2] that if we could choose \u03b1 such that |h\u03c8(0)|{n}i| < 0.5, for all |{n}i\nwhich are the Fock states and also the eigenstates of HP , then\n2\n1\n(4)\n\u21d2 |{n(0) }i is the ground state of HP ,\nIf h\u03c8(T )|{n(0) }i >\n2\nassuming such a ground state is non-degenerate, and provided an extra condition has to be satisfied,\nfor all 0 < t < T , namely\n(5)\n\nhe(t)|HP \u2212 HI |g(t)i\n\n=\n6\n\n0,\n\nTHIS IS AN EDITED VERSION, WITH UPDATED REFERENCES, OF AN EARLIER REPLY TO\nSMITH IN JULY, 2005.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nTIEN D.

For higher\ndimensions, the non-commutativity of the Hamiltonians is no longer a sufficient condition for (5).\nAnd we need make sure that the condition (5) is observed.\nRecently, Smith has claimed to have three counterexamples [8] against the criterion (4) above.\nOf the three provided, actually there is only one that is relevant and fits the form of our timedependent Hamiltonian (1) in the case of one variable, but truncated to five dimensions and with\nthe diagonal term (1 \u2212 |\u03b1|2 )1 added to (3),\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n\u2212\u03b1\u2217\n0\u221a\n0\n0\n2 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 4 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212\u03b1\n0\u221a\n0 \uf8f7\n2\u221a\n\u2212\u03b1\u2217 2\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nS\nS\n\u2217\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nHP = \uf8ec\n(8) HI = \uf8ec 0 \u2212\u03b1 2\n3\u221a\n\u2212\u03b1 3\n0 \uf8f7;\n\uf8ec 0 0 5 0 0 \uf8f7.\n\u2217 \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed 0\n0 0 0 3 0 \uf8f8\n0\n\u2212\u03b1 3\n4\n\u22122\u03b1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0\n0\n0\n\u22122\u03b1\n5\n\nSmith has chosen the particular values \u03b1 = 1 and T = 13.3444. In this note we shall only\ninvestigate this example; other criticisms by Smith in [8] also overlap with others', our replies to\nwhich have been given in [5].\nIndeed, when we solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (3), starting with the exact ground state of HIS ,\nwe obtain at time t = 0 no Fock-state occupation probabilities is more than 0.5, but at t = T , the\nfirst excited Fock state has a probability of 0.999323 \u2013 apparently contradicting the criterion (4).\nWe have depicted the occupation probabilities of the instantaneous ground and first excited states\nas functions of time in Fig. 1. At first, the ground-state occupation is close to one, as it should\nbe because we start the system in the initial ground state. Then, suddenly at around t \u2248 10 this\nprobability plummets to zero, accompanying by a stellar rise of that of the first excited state.\nA closer inspection of spectral flow (the flow of eigenvalues of H(t) as functions of time) reveals\na singular behaviour of the flow also around t \u2248 10, namely, that of an avoided crossing of the\ninstantaneous ground and first excited state as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.\nAs a matter of fact, all these anomalous behaviours are caused by the violation of the condition (5), or equivalently, by the realisation of (6) and (7), as shown by the simultaneous vanishing\nof the three matrix elements, see Fig. 4, around (but a bit earlier than) the time of the anomalous\ntransfer of probability from the ground state to the first excited state.\nAppropriately large values for \u03b1. Surely, for that value of \u03b1 = 1 one could increase T and\neventually will have an arbitrarily high occupation probability of the final ground state, as guaranteed by the quantum adiabatic theorem. However, for the present value of T = 13.3444 we can\navoid the violation of (5), and thus restore the criterion (4), by widening the gap between the\ninstantaneous ground and first excited states. This can be achieved by choosing an appropriately\nlarge value for the parameter \u03b1. In Fig. 5 we plot the occupation probabilities of the instantaneous\nground and first excited states as functions of \u03b1. It is seen that as long as \u03b1 > 2 our identification\ncriterion (4) is again valid. We present further results for \u03b1 = 3, as an example, in Figs. 6, 7\nand 8. None of those shows any anomalous behaviour. (We also plot the ground state occupation\nfor \u03b1 = 3 (filled black circles) in Fig. 1 for comparison with the case \u03b1 = 1.)\nWe have provided some arguments in [5] to indicate that the condition (5) can always be\nobtained for sufficiently large values of |\u03b1|.

The probabilities, for \u03b1 = 3, for different Fock states as functions of\nthe final time T . There is only one state that has a probability eventually rising\nabove 0.5 (red boxes) and that is the true ground state of HPS , namely |4i.\ntruncation would distort the spacings between the eigenvalues of HI , severely away from unity particularly near the truncation. In Smith's truncation to five dimensions, for example, the four spacings between the eigenvalues of HIS are 1.11927, 1.40986, 1.84784, and 2.54043, respectively from\nthe lowest to the highest eigenvalues, which are (0.0114457, 1.13072, 2.54058, 4.38841, 6.92885).\nThat is, the spacing between the fourth and fifth eigenvalues near the truncation is 2.54043, which\nshould have been one. This and the fact that the ground state of HPS happens to be right at the\ntruncation, |ni = |5i, make the problem very sensitive to boundary effects.\nHowever, the addition of extra states or the imposition of (anti)-periodic boundary conditions\non the truncated spaces may remove the violation of (5), as shown below.\n\n\fOCCUPATION PROBABILITIES\n\n7\n\nEigenvalues\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nt\nFigure 9.

Figs. 9, 10, 11 and 12\nshow the non-anomalous and drastically different behaviour, as compared to (8), for the same\nparameters \u03b1 = 1 and T = 13.3444.\nBased on such sensitivity and some other evidence, we suspect that a violation of (5) or,\nequivalently, a realisation of (6) and (7) could not be attained either for very large or an infinite\nnumber of dimensions, or for more than one variable. It is perhaps appropriate to mention here\nthat all the numerical simulations presented in [5] have been obtained not with truncations with\nrigid boundary as the cases Smith has considered but with movable boundaries where more Fock\nstates are included when and if necessary. Results from further analytic investigations for an\ninfinite number of dimensions would be reported elsewhere when they become available1.\nWe should note further that (4) may not be the only means which can be used to identify the\nfinal ground state. A more general one, as discussed in [1, 3], could be a matching of the statistics\nof the measurement outcomes of a physical quantum adiabatic process (in a space of presumably\ninfinite dimensions) with those of a numerical simulation of the process with a necessarily truncated\nspace. As the size of the truncation is enlarged, the true final ground state would eventually be\nincluded in such a truncated Fock space. From then on, further enlargement of the truncated\nFock space only serves to improve the precision of the statistics comparison. (This is another\nmanifestation of the finitely refutable nature of our problem, as mentioned in [5].)\nFinally, we also would like to point out that in addition to the physical process discussed here,\nwhich is governed by the linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we can also map Hilbert's tenth problem\ninto a class of non-linear differential equations [4, 6], that is readily available to pure mathematical\ninvestigation.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are indebted to Warren Smith for numerous email exchanges and for his critical observations\nthat led to the counterexample, which in turn has led to the investigation above.
