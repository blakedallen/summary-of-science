Introduction\nIn these lecture notes we provide a short introduction to the ideas related to the\ncorrespondence between gauge theories and gravity theories. For other reviews of the\nsubject, includding a more complete list of references, see [1,2,3,4,5].\nWe start by discussing the simplifications that ocurr in the large N limit of field\ntheories. We discuss first the large N limit of vector theories, then the large N limit of\ntheories where the fundamental fields are N \u00d7 N matrices and we show that these theories\nare expected to be described in terms of strings [6]. If we start with a four dimensional\n\ngauge theory, we might naively expect to find a strings moving in four dimensions. But\nstrings are not consistent in four flat dimensions. As we try to proceed, we are forced\nto introduce at least one more dimension [7]. If the gauge theory is conformal, then the\noriginal flat dimensions, together with this new extra dimension are constrained by the\nsymmetries to form an Anti-de-Sitter spacetime. We will describe some basic properties\nof Anti-de-Sitter spacetimes. Then we present the simplest example of the relationship\nbetween a four dimensional field theory and a gravity theory. Namely, we discuss the\nrelationship between Yang Mills theory with four supersymmetries to type IIB superstring\ntheory on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [8]. We later give the general prescription linking computations of\ncorrelation functions in the gauge theory to the computations of amplitudes in the gravity\ntheory [9][10]. This is a general prescription that should hold for any field theory that has\na gravity dual.\nFinally we discuss a particular limit of the relationship between N = 4 Yang Mills\n\nand AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 where we consider particles with large angular momentum on the sphere\n\n[11]. In this limit the relevant region of the geometry looks like a plane wave where we can\nquantize strings exactly. Through a simple gauge theory computation one can reproduce\nthe string spectrum.\n\n2.\n\nLarge N\nThere are theories that contain a large number of fields related by a symmetry such as\n\nSO(N ) or U (N ). These theories simplify when N is taken to infinity. For a more extended\ndiscussion of this subject see [12].\n1\n\n\f2.1. Large N for vector theories\nConsider a theory with N fields \u03b7 i , where i = 1, * * * N with O(N) symmetry. For\n\nexample,\n\n1\nS= 2\n2g0\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03c3(\u2202~n)2 ,\n\n~n2 = 1\n\n(2.1)\n\nFirst note that the effective coupling of the theory is g02 N . The theory simplifies in the\nlimit where we keep g02 N fixed and we take N \u2192 \u221e. In this limit only a subset of Feynman\n\ndiagrams survives. A very convenient way to proceed is to introduce a Lagrange multiplier,\n\u03bb, that enforces the constraint in (2.1) and integrate out the fields ~n.\nZ\n1\nS = 2 d2 \u03c3[(\u2202~n)2 + \u03bb(~n2 \u2212 1)]\n2g0\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1\nN\n2\n2\nlog det(\u2212\u2202 + \u03bb) \u2212 2\n\u03bbd \u03c3\nS=\n2\ng0 N\nWe get a classical theory for \u03bb in this large N limit, so we set\n1=\n2\n\nN g02\n\u2212\n\n\u03bb =\u039b e\n\nZ\n\n4\u03c0\nN g2\n0\n\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(2.2)\n\n= 0. We get\n\nd2 p\nN g02\n1\n=\nlog \u039b2 /\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)2 p2 + \u03bb2\n4\u03c0\n\n(2.3)\n\n4\u03c0\n2 \u2212 N g2\n\n=\u03bc e\n\nwhere g0 is the bare coupling, by absorbing the \u039b dependence in g0 we define the renormalized coupling g. Notice that the cutoff dependence of g0 is that of an asymptotically\nfree theory. By looking again at (2.2) we find that the expectation value for \u03bb in (2.3)\ngives a mass to the ~n fields. Moreover, the model has an unbroken O(N ) symmetry. The\nfact the O(N) symmetry is restored is consistent with the fact that in two dimensions we\ncannot break continuous symmetries. Note that the g 2 N dependence of \u03bb in (2.3) implies\nthat the mass for ~n is non-perturbative in g 2 N . Notice that, even though the dependence\nof the mass in g 2 N looks non-perturbative, we have obtained this result by summing Feynman diagrams, in particular we obtained it through a one loop diagram contribution to\nthe effective action and then balancing this term against a tree level term. Large N was\ncrucial to ensure that no further diagrams contribute.\nThis theory is similar to QCD4 since it is asymptotically free and has a mass gap. It\nhas a large N expansion and the large N expansion contains the fact that the theory has\na mass gap. This mass gap is non perturbative in g 2 N .\n2\n\n\f2.2. Matrix theories\nConsider theories where the basic field is a hermitian matrix M . This arises, for\nexample, in a U (N ) gauge theory, or a U (N ) gauge theory with matter fields in the\nadjoint representation. The Lagrangian has a schematic form\n1\n1\nL = 2 T r[(\u2202M )2 + M 2 + M 3 + * * *] = 2 T r[(\u2202M )2 + V (M )]\ng\ng\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe action is U (N ) invariant M \u2192 U M U \u2020 . It is convenient to introduce a double line\nnotation to keep track of the matrix indices\ni\nMj\n\ni\nj\n\nFig. 1: Propagator\n\n....\n\nFig. 2: Vertices\n\nEach propagator, fig. 1, contributes a factor g 2 in the Feynman diagrams. Each vertex,\nfig. 2, contributes a factor of 1/g 2 . Finally, each closed line will contain a sum over the\ngauge index and will contribute a factor of N , see Fig. 3.\n\ni\n\nFig. 3: Closed line contributes a factor of N .\n\nEach diagram contributes with\n(g 2 )#Propagators\u2212#vertices N #Closed\n\nlines\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe can draw these diagrams on a two dimensional surface and think of it as a geometric\nfigure. We see that (2.5) becomes\nN #Faces\u2212#Edges+#vertices (g 2 N )Power = N 2\u22122h (g 2 N )Power\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere h is the genus of the two dimensional surface. Namely, a sphere has genus h = 0, a\ntorus has genus h = 1, etc.\n3\n\n\fN 3 (g 2) ~ N 2 (g 2N)\n2\nN 4 (g 2) 2 ~ N 2 (g 2N)\n\nFig. 4: Planar diagrams\n\n11111\n00000\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n0\n1\n00000\n11111\n0\n1\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n1\n0\n\nN 0 (g 2 N)\n\nTorus\n\nFig. 5: A non-planar diagram\n\nA few examples of diagrams that can be drawn on a plane or a sphere are shown in\nfig. 4, and example of a diagram that cannot be drawn on a sphere but can be drawn on\na torus is shown in fig. 5. The sum of all planar diagrams gives\nN 2 [c0 + c1 (g 2 N ) + c2 (g 2 N )2 + * * *] = N 2 f (g 2 N )\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere the ci are numerical coefficients depending on the detailed evaluation of each Feynman graph. This detailed evaluation contains the momentum integrals. The full partition\nfunction has the form\nlog Z =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nN 2\u22122h fh (g 2 N )\n\n(2.8)\n\nh=0\n\nThe 't Hooft limit is\nN \u2192\u221e,\n\n\u03bb \u2261 g 2 N = fixed\n\n(2.9)\n\n\u03bb is the 't Hooft coupling. In this limit only the planar diagrams contribute. As \u03bb gets\nlarge a large number of diagrams contribute and they become dense on the sphere, so\nwe might think that they describe a discretized worldsheet of some string theory. This\nworldsheet theory is defined to be whatever results from summing the planar diagrams.\nThis argument is valid for any matrix theory. The argument does not give us a practical\nway of finding the worldsheet theory. In bosonic Yang Mills theory g 2 runs. In fact, the\nbeta function has a smooth large N limit\n\u03bb\u0307 = \u03b2(\u03bb) + o(1/N 2 )\n4\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fSo we have \u03bb(E). The string description will be appropriate where \u03bb(E) becomes large.\nIf we add matter in the fundamental, then we get diagrams with boundaries. These give\nrise to open strings which are mesons containing a quark and anti-quark.\nSome features of QCD with N = 3 are similar to those of N = \u221e, like the fact that\n\nmesons contain a quark and anti-quark, and that they have small interactions. Strings are\nalso suggested by the existence of Regge trajectories. Namely that particles with highest\nspin for a given mass obey \u03b1\u2032 m2 = J + const. Confinement is also closely associated to\na string that forms between the quark and anti-quark. Though we will see later that the\nstring description does not necessarily imply confinement.\n2.3. Large N correlators\nConsider operators of the form\nO = N tr[f (M )]\n\n(2.11)\n\ndiagrammatically represented in Fig. 6.\n\n+...\n\nFig. 6: Operator insertion\n\nIf we add them to the action, they have the same scaling as an extra interaction vertex.\nIn the large N limit their correlation functions factorize\nhtr[f1 (M )]tr[f2 (M )]i = htr[f1 (M )]ihtr[f2(M )]i + o(1/N 2 )\n\n(2.12)\n\nNotice that this implies that the leading contribution is a disconnected diagram. All\nconnected correlation functions of operators normalized as in (2.11) go like N 2 . This\nmeans that\nhOOic \u223c N 2 ,\n\nhOOOic \u223c N 2 ,\n\nhOOOic\n\n3/2\nhOOic\n\n\u223c\n\n1\nN\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere the subscript indicates the connected part. In the string description the insertion of\nthese operators corresponds to the insertion of a vertex operator on the string worldsheet.\nAn interesting operator in gauge theories is the Wilson loop operator\nH\nA\nW (C) = N T r[P e C ]\n\n(2.14)\n\nFor a contour of large area the expectation value of this operator should go like e\u2212T (Area)\nfor a confining theory. T is then the string tension.\n5\n\n\f3.\n\nGuessing the string theory\nRather than summing all Feynman diagrams one would like to guess what the final\n\nstring theory description is. Naively, for d = 4 Yang Mills we expect to get a bosonic string\ntheory that lives in four dimensions. We know this is not correct. The bosonic string is\nnot consistent quantum mechanically in d = 4. It is consistent in d = 26 flat dimensions,\nbut this is not the theory we are interested in.\nThe reason for this inconsistency is that the classical Polyakov action\nZ\n\u221a ab\nS\u223c\ngg \u2202a X\u2202b X\n\n(3.1)\n\nhas a Weyl symmetry gab \u2192 \u03a9gab which is not a symmetry quantum mechanically. In the\nquantum theory, under a change metric of the form gab = e\u03c6 \u011dab the partition function\nZ\n\u2212Sef f (g)\ne\n= DXD(bc)e\u2212S[X,g]\u2212S[b,c,g]\n(3.2)\nchanges as\n(26 \u2212 D)\nSef f (g) \u2212 Sef f (\u011d) =\n48\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1 \u02c6 2\n(\u2207\u03c6) + R\u0302(2) \u03c6 + \u03bc2 e\u03c6\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nThis action for \u03c6 is called \"Liouville\" action. Even though the initial classical action for\nthe conformal factor in the metric was zero, a non-trivial action was generated quantum\nmechanically. Integrating over \u03c6 is like adding a new dimension.\nFor D \u2264 1 this is the right answer. We start with a matrix integral or a matrix\n\nquantum mechanics and we get a string in one or two dimensions. Actually, it is necessary\n\nto do a particular scaling limit in the matrix quantum mechanics which involves N \u2192 \u221e\n\nand a tuning of the potential that is analogous to taking the 't Hooft coupling to a region\nwhere there is a large number of Feynman diagrams that contribute, see [13].\nFor D = 4 it is not known how to quantize the Liouville action. Nevertheless the\nlesson we extract is that we need to include at least one extra dimension. So we introduce\nan extra dimension and look for the most general string theory. If we are interested in\nfour dimensional gauge theories we look for strings in five dimensions. We need to specify\nthe space where string moves. It should have 4d Poincare symmetry, so the metric has the\nform\nds2 = w(z)2 (dx21+3 + dz 2 )\n\n(3.4)\n\nwe have used the reparametrization symmetry to set the coefficient of dz 2 equal to that of\ndx2 .\n6\n\n\fNow suppose that we were dealing with a scale invariant field theory. N = 4 Yang\n\nMills is an example. Then\n\nx \u2192 \u03bbx\n\n(3.5)\n\nshould be a symmetry. But in string theory we have a scale, set by the string tension. So\nthe only way that a string (with the usual Nambu action1 ) could be symmetric under (3.5)\nis that this scaling is an isometry of (3.4). This means that z \u2192 \u03bbz and that w = R/z. So\nwe are dealing with 5 dimensional Anti-de-Sitter space\nds2 = R2\n\ndx2 + dz 2\nz2\n\n(3.6)\n\n1\nWarp Factor W ~ __\nZ\n4\n\nR\n\nZ\n\nBoundary\n\nZ=1\n\nHorizon\n\nZ=0\n\nFig. 7: A sketch of Anti-de-Sitter space. We emphasize the behavior of the warp\nfactor.\n\nThis is a spacetime with constant negative curvature and it is the most symmetric\nspacetime with negative curvature. The most symmetric spacetime with positive curvature\nis de-Sitter. In Euclidean space the most symmetric positive curvature space is a sphere and\nthe most symmetric negative curvature one is hyperbolic space. These are the Euclidean\ncontinuation of de-Sitter and Anti-de-Sitter respectively.\n3.1. Conformal symmetry\nA local field theory that is scale invariant is usually also conformal invariant. The\nchange in the action due to a change in the metric is\nZ\n\u03b4S = T \u03bc\u03bd \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n\n(3.7)\n\nIt is possible to write a string action that is conformal invariant in four dimensions [14] but\n\nit is not know how to quantize it.\n\n7\n\n\fUnder a coordinate transformation x\u03bc \u2192 x\u03bc + \u03b6 \u03bc (x) the action changes by (3.7) with\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = \u2207\u03bc \u03b6\u03bd + \u2207\u03bd \u03b6\u03bc\n\n(3.8)\n\nIf \u03b6 \u03bc generates an isometry then the metric is left invariant, so that we have \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = 0 in\n(3.8). The scale transformation (3.5) gives \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = 2\u03b4\u03bbg\u03bc\u03bd . The action would be invariant if\nT\u03bc\u03bc = 0. In this case the action is also invariant under coordinate transformations such that\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = h(x)g\u03bc\u03bd in (3.8), and h is any function. Coordinate transformations of this type\nare called conformal transformations. In d=4 they form the group SO(2, 4). This group\nis obtained by adding to the Poincare group the scale transformation and the inversion\n~x \u2192 \u2212~x/x2 . We see that the inversion maps the origin to infinity. It turns out that the\n\nconformal group acts more nicely if we compactify the space and we consider S 3 \u00d7 R in\nthe Lorentzian case or S 4 in the Euclidean case.\n\nNote also that if the trace of the stress tensor is zero, then the theory is also Weyl\ninvariant, it is invariant under a rescaling of the metric g \u2192 \u03a92 g. In the quantum case\n\nthis symmetry will have a calculable anomaly and one can find the change in physical\nquantities under such a rescaling.\n3.2. Isometries of AdS\nIn order to see clearly the AdS isometries we write AdS as a hypersurface in R2,4\n2\n\u2212X\u22121\n\u2212 X02 + X12 + X22 + X32 + X42 = \u2212R2\n\n(3.9)\n\nNote that even though the ambient space has 2 time directions the surface contains only\none time direction, the other is orthogonal to the surface. You should not be confused by\nthese two times, AdS is an ordinary Lorentzian space with one time!. We recover (3.6)\nafter writing X\u22121 + X4 = R/z, X\u03bc = Rx\u03bc /z for \u03bc = 0, * * * 3. By choosing an appropriate\n\nparameterization of (3.9) we can also write the metric\n\nds2 = R2 [\u2212 cosh2 \u03c1d\u03c4 2 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1d\u03a923 ]\n\n(3.10)\n\nThese are called \"global\" coordinates. They cover the whole AdS space. In contrast the\n\"Poincare\" coordinates in (3.6) only cover a portion. Note that translations in \u03c4 correspond\nto rotations of X\u22121 and X0 in (3.9). So in the construction based on (3.9) we would get\nclosed timelike curves. Fortunately we can go to the covering space and consider (3.10)\n8\n\n\fwith \u03c4 non-compact. When we talk about AdS we are always going to think about this\ncovering space.\nIn the metric (3.10) we can take out a factor of cosh2 \u03c1, and define a new coordinate\ndx = d\u03c1/ cosh \u03c1. We see that the range of x is finite. This allows us to understand\nthe Penrose diagram of AdS. It is a solid cylinder whose boundary is S 3 \u00d7 R where R\n\ncorresponds to the time direction. The field theory will be defined on this boundary. On\nthis boundary the isometries of AdS act like the conformal group acts in four dimensions.\nThe proper distance to the boundary along a surface of constant time is infinite.\n\nSolid\nCylinder\n\nMassive\nParticle\n\nS3\n\u03c1=0\n\nLight\nRay\n\nTime\n\u03c1=\u221e\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 8: (a) Penrose diagram of AdS.

These hyperplanes correspond to the horizons\nat z = \u221e and t = \u00b1\u221e.\n\nFinally note that Weyl transformations in the 4d theory correspond to picking different\nfunctions as conformal factors when we compute the Penrose diagram so that the boundary\nwill have different metrics which differ by an overall function of the coordinates on the\nboundary.\n3.3. Mapping of states and operators\n9\n\n\fS3\n\nOperator\n\nR\nStates of CFT on S 3\n\n=\n\nOperators of Eu lidean CFT on R4\n\nFig. 10: We can map states of the field theory on S 3 \u00d7 R to operators on R4 .\n\nIn a CFT we have a correspondence between operators on R4 and states on the\ncylinder S 3 \u00d7 R. This can be seen as follows. We start with a state on the cylinder,\n\nwe go to Euclidean time and then notice that the cylinder and the plane differ only by\na Weyl transformation so that the two theories are related. The vacuum on the cylinder\ncorresponds to the identity on the plane. The energy of the state in the cylinder corresponds\nto the conformal dimension of the operator on the plane, Ecyl = \u2206.\n3.4. N = 4 U(N) Yang Mills and strings on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nConsider a theory with four supersymmetries in 4 dimensions, namely sixteen real\nsupercharges. This theory has a unique field content, there is a unique supermultiplet.\nOur only freedom is the choice of gauge group and coupling constants. The field content\nis as follows. One vector field or gauge boson A\u03bc , six scalars \u03c6I I = 1, ..., 6 and four\nfermions \u03c7\u03b1i , \u03c7\u03b1\u0307\u012b , where \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0307 are four dimensional chiral and anti-chiral spinor indices\nrespectively and i = 1, 2, 3, 4 is an index in the 4 of SU(4) = SO(6) and \u012b in the 4\u0304. (The\n4 is the spinor of SO(6)). The theory has a global S0(6) symmetry. This symmetry\ndoes not commute with the supercharges, since different components of the multiplet have\ndifferent SO(6) quantum numbers. In fact, the supercharges are in the 4 and 4\u0304 of SU(4).\nA symmetry that does not commute with the supercharges is called an \"R\" symmetry.\nNote that SU(4) is a chiral symmetry.\nThe Lagrangian is schematically of the form\n\"\n#\nX\n1\nL = 2 T r F 2 + (D\u03c6)2 + \u03c7\u0304 6 D\u03c7 +\n[\u03c6I \u03c6J ]2 + \u03c7\u0304\u0393I \u03c6I \u03c7 + \u03b8T r[F \u2227 F ]\ng\n\n(3.11)\n\nIJ\n\nIt contains two parameters, the coupling constant and a theta angle. The theory is scale\ninvariant quantum mechanically. Namely the beta function is zero to all orders. So it is\nalso conformal invariant. The extra conformal symmetries commuted with the 16 ordinary\n10\n\n\fsupersymmetries give 16 new supersymmetries. In any conformal theory we have this\ndoubling of supersymmetries.\nThe theory has an S-duality under which\n\u03b8\n2\u03c0\n\u03c4Y M =\n+i 2\n2\u03c0\ngY M\n\n(3.12)\n\ntransforms into \u22121/\u03c4 . This combines with shifts in the \u03b8 angle into SL(2, Z) acting on \u03c4\nas it usually acts on the upper half plane. The 't Hooft coupling is \u03bb = gY2 M N .\n\n3.5. IIB strings on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 .\nSuppose that the radius is large. We will later find under which conditions this is\ntrue. Then we are looking for a solution of the type IIB supergravity equations of motion.\nThese equations follow form the action2\nS\u223c\n\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\ngR + F52\n\n(3.13)\n\nplus the self duality constraint for the fiveform field strength, F5 = \u2217F5 , which has to be\n\nimposed by hand. Due to the existence of D3 branes the flux of F5 is quantized.\nZ\nF5 = N\n\n(3.14)\n\nS5\n\nChoosing a fiveform fieldstrength proportional to the volume form on S 5 plus the volume\nform on AdS5 we find that AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 is a solution. The radius R of the sphere and the\n\nradius of AdS are\n\nR = (4\u03c0gs N )1/4 ls \u223c N 1/4 lpl\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhere gs is the string coupling and 2\u03c0ls2 is the inverse of the string tension. It is clear\nfrom (3.13) that the radius in Planck units should have this form since the F52 term in the\naction scales like N 2 , while the first term in (3.13) scales like R8 . The equations of motion\nwill balance these two terms giving (3.15).\nIt is also amusing to understand the energetics that gives rise to the negative cosmological constant in AdS5 . For this purpose consider a compactification of the ten dimensional\ntheory on S 5 to five dimensions with a fiveform fieldstrength on an S 5 of radius r. Then\nthe five dimensional action is schematically\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a 3\n\u221a\n5\u221a\n(5)\n2 \u22125\nS = r g5 R \u2212 g5 N r + g5 r =\ngE RE \u2212 V (r)\nwith\n\nV (r) = r\n\n\u221225/3\n\n2 \u22125\n\n(N r\n\n2\n\n(3.16)\n\n3\n\n\u2212r )\n\nWe have suppressed the dependence of the action on the fields that are not important for\nour purposes.\n\n11\n\n\fFrom F 2\n\nV(r)\n0\n\nFrom Curvature\nAdS\n\nFig. 11: Effective potential after compactifying ten dimensional supergravity on\na five sphere with a flux of the fiveform field strength.\n\nThe second term comes from the flux and the third term come from the curvature of\nS 5 . Note that the sign in Einstein's action is such that an internal space with positive\ncurvature gives rise to a negative contribution to the energy in the non-compact dimensions.\nThe potential should be computed in 5d Einstein frame. This potential goes to zero as\nr \u2192 \u221e, which is a general feature of KK compactification. One can also see that there is\na minimum that balances the two pieces with an r as in (3.15).\n\n3.6. N = 4 YM is the same as IIB on AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nNow we want to relate the two theories we have just talked about. The general\nreason that they could be related is that in the 't Hooft limit we expect strings. This\nstring will move in a space that has more than four dimensions. The field theory has 32\nsupersymmetries which is the same as the number of supersymmetries of type IIB string\ntheory on this background. In fact, the two supergroups are the same. So it is reasonable\nthat the two theories could be related.\nThere is an argument that relates these two theories which relies on looking at the\nnear horizon geometry of D3 branes. The field theory on N D3 branes is N = 4 U(N)\n\nYang Mills at low energies. The near horizon geometry of D3 branes is AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . Since\n\nexcitations that live near the horizon have very small energies from the point of view of\nthe outside observer we conclude that at low energies only these excitations will survive.\nSo in the low energy limit we have two alternative descriptions which should be equivalent\n[8].\nThe coupling constants of YM are related to the string coupling and vev of the RR\nscalar\n\ni\ngY2 M\n\n+\n\n\u03b8\ni\n= \u03c4Y M = \u03c4 =\n+\u03c7\n2\u03c0\ngs\n\nThis notation emphasizes that both theories have an SL(2,Z) duality symmetry.\n12\n\n(3.17)\n\n\fThe relation between the two theories is a \"duality\". There is a parameter, gY2 M N ,\nsuch that in the region where it is very small one description (the Yang Mills one) is\nweakly coupled and the other (gravity) is strongly coupled, while the opposite is true\nwhen this parameter is large. Let us expand on this point. The gravity description is\na good approximation to string theory if the radius of the space is much larger than ls ,\nsince ls is the intrinsic size of the graviton. We see from (3.15) (3.17) that this happens\nwhen gY2 M N \u226b 1. It is good that the two weakly coupled descriptions are non-overlapping.\n\nOtherwise we would have blatant contradictions since the two theories have rather different\nproperties in their respectively weakly coupled regimes. This fact also makes the conjecture\nhard to disprove, or hard to prove. In this supersymmetric case there are some quantities\nthat are independent of the coupling which can be computed on both sides. Checking that\nthese quantities agree we have checks of the duality. For a more detailed discussion of\nthese checks see [4].\nFinally note that \u03b1\u2032 is not a parameter in string theory so all physical quantities\ndepend only on the size of AdS in string units. A useful way to think about it is to choose\nunits where the radius R = 1, then \u03b1\u2032 = \u221a\n\n1\n.\n2\ngY\nN\nM\n\nAll gravity computations depend only\n\nN , but not on gY2 M N . The reason is that if we write the action in Einstein frame then\n\u22128\nwe have an overall factor of lpl\n\u223c N 2 . Then the \u03b1\u2032 expansion is an expansion in terms of\np\n1/ gY2 M N .\n\n4.\n\nEstablishing the dictionary\n\n4.1. Correlation functions\nWe now consider correlation functions. We focus on the Euclidean case. The Euclidean\nCFT is dual to Euclidean ADS which is the same as hyperbolic space. We can write\ncoordinates as in (3.6) where now dx2 denotes the metric on R4 .\nWe can evaluate the gravity partition function as a function of the boundary values\nof the fields. Since AdS has a boundary we need to specify the boundary conditions for\nthe fields. The value of the partition function depends on these boundary conditions. If\nthe gravity theory is weakly coupled we can approximate this by the value of the classical\naction\nZbulk [\u03c6(~x, z)|z=0 = \u03c60 (~x)] \u223c e\u2212N\n\n2\n\nSclass [\u03c6]+o(\u03b1\u2032 )\n\n13\n\n\u00d7 (QuantumCorrections)\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fWe emphasized the fact that the classical gravity computation will always depend on N\nthrough this overall factor in the action and will be independent of g 2 N . Stringy corrections\nwill correct the gravity action into the classical string action, whose form we do not know,\nbut we know that it will have an expansion in powers of \u03b1\u2032 = \u221a 1 . Some terms in\ng2N\n\n4\n\nthis expansion are known. For example, there is a well studied R correction to the ten\ndimensional action.\nFor each field in the 5 dimensional bulk, we have a corresponding operator in the dual\nfield theory. In general, figuring out which operator corresponds to which field is hard. But\nfor some special operators it is easy due to their symmetries. For example, the graviton\nis associated to the stress tensor operator in the boundary theory. Similarly the dilaton is\nrelated to the Lagrangian of the theory, since we saw that the coupling is related to the\ndilaton and a change in coupling adds an operator proportional to the Lagrangian.\nThe AdS/CF T dictionary says that the quantity appearing in (4.1) is equal to the\ngenerating function of the correlation functions of the corresponding operators.\nR 4\nZbulk [\u03c6(~x, z)|z=0 = \u03c60 (~x)] = he d x\u03c60 (~x)O(~x) iField Theory\n\n(4.2)\n\nNote that \u03c6o (~x) is an arbitrary function specifying the boundary values of the bulk field\n\u03c6. Taking derivatives with respect to \u03c60 and setting it to zero we obtain the correlation\nfunctions of the operator.\nSo the final conclusion is that changes in the boundary conditions of AdS correspond\nto changes in the Lagrangian of the field theory. Infinitesimal changes in the boundary\ncondition correspond to the insertion of an operator.\nNow let us discuss this more explicitly. We consider the metric (3.6). Consider a\nscalar field of mass m. Its action is\nZ\ndx4 dz 2\n2\n[z (\u2202\u03c6)2 + m2 R2 \u03c62 ]\nS=N\n5\nz\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe action contains higher order terms in \u03c6. For the moment we focus on the quadratic\nterms.\nIn order to evaluate the classical action on a classical solution we need to solve the\nclassical equations\nz 3 \u2202z (\n\n1\n\u2202z \u03c6) \u2212 p2 z 2 \u03c6 \u2212 m2 R2 \u03c6 = 0\nz3\n\n(4.4)\n\nWe have used translation symmetry to go to Fourier space for the R4 part. This equation\ncan be solved exactly in terms of Bessel functions. For the moment let us just understand\n14\n\n\fthe behavior of the solutions near the boundary of AdS, at z \u223c 0. We then look for\nsolutions of (4.4) in terms of powers of the form \u03c6 \u223c z \u03b1 , where \u03b1 obeys the equation\n\u03b1(\u03b1 \u2212 4) \u2212 m2 R2 = 0\np\n\u03b1\u00b1 = 2 \u00b1 4 + m2 R2\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe solution with \u03b1\u2212 dominates near z \u2192 0. The solution with \u03b1+ always decays when\n\nz \u2192 0. We will impose the boundary condition on the dominating solution. More precisely\nwe choose a boundary condition of the form\n\n\u03c6(x, z)|z=\u01eb = \u01eb\u03b1\u2212 \u03c6r0 (x)\n\n(4.6)\n\nIn general we need to impose boundary conditions at z = \u01eb and then take \u01eb \u2192 0 at\n\nthe end of the computation. We see that if we keep \u03c6r0 (x) fixed as we take \u01eb \u2192 0 the\n\nsolution in the bulk, at some fixed z will have a finite limit. So we call this \u03c6r0 (x) the\n\n\"renormalized\" boundary condition. This is related to the fact that in the field theory we\nneed to renormalize the operator.\nUnder a rescaling of coordinates in the field theory, which in AdS is the isometry\nx \u2192 \u03bbx, z \u2192 \u03bbz, the original field \u03c6 does not get scaled, but due to the \u01eb factor in (4.6)\nwe see that \u03c6r0 has dimension \u03b1\u2212 . Since we interpret the resulting gravity formulas through\n(4.2), where on the right hand side we have \u03c6r0 (x), we conclude that the dimension of the\n\ncorresponding operator is\n\u2206 =4 \u2212 \u03b1\u2212 = \u03b1+\np\n\u2206 =2 + 4 + (mR)2\n\n(4.7)\n\nNote that for the dilaton, which has m = 0, we get the correct dimension, \u2206 = 4.\nSince the theory is exactly conformal for all values of gY M the operator that changes\ninfinitesimally the Yang Mills coupling should have dimension four. Similarly, the fact\nthat the graviton is massless is related to the fact that the stress tensor has dimension\nfour. This last fact does not depend on supersymmetry and is very general, valid for any\nlocal conformal QFT.\nNote that in order to make the operator to field correspondence it is necessary to\nKaluza-Klein reduce all fields to five dimensions. So when we talked about the dilaton,\nwe were referring to the l = 0 mode on the five-sphere which gives rise to a massless\nfield on AdS. A mode with angular momentum l on the five-sphere has mass given by\nm2 = l(l + 4)/R2 which leads to\n\u2206 =4+l .\n15\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fThe corresponding operators are roughly of the form [9,10]\nT r[F 2 \u03c6(I1 * * * \u03c6Il ) ]\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere the indices Ii are taken in a symmetric traceless combination which corresponds\nto the representations of the spherical harmonics. In (4.9) one should order the fields\nappropriately and it is also necessary to introduce the fermionic fields [15]. The dimension\nof (4.9) can be computed easily at weak coupling, we just sum the dimensions of the\nindividual fields to get \u2206 = 4 + l. We see that we get the same as the strong coupling\nresult (4.8). The reason is that the operators (4.9) are in protected multiplets. A protected\nmultiplet is a multiplet of supersymmetry that is smaller than the generic multiplet. Such\nmultiplets have dimensions which are given in terms of their SO(6) quantum numbers.\nTherefore, such operators cannot have coupling dependent anomalous dimensions.\nIt turns out that in the case of N = 4 YM all the operators that are in protected\n\nmultiplets correspond to all the KK modes of the gravity fields. This provides a nice\n\nmatch since we have the same number of protected states on both sides. This matching\ngoes beyond the matching of symmetries of the two theories. In fact, we could have\nobtained extra protected operators in the YM theory, for example. This would have killed\nthe conjecture since we do not have any other light states in supergravity. As an example,\nnote that if we changed the gauge group to SO(N) instead of U(N) then we have we do not\nhave all the operators (4.9), we only have the ones with even l. In fact, the SO(N) theory\ncorresponds to an orientifold of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 that maps antipodal points on S 5 [16] 3 .\n\nNote that not all operators are protected. For example, the operator tr[\u03c6I \u03c6I ] has\n\ndimension two at weak coupling but there is no corresponding operator with dimension\ntwo at large coupling. What is its dimension at strong coupling?. As we discussed, all\nsupergravity modes have dimensions that remain fixed as g 2 N \u2192 \u221e. But a string the-\n\nory also contains massive string states, with masses m \u223c 1/ls , which according to (4.7)\n\ncorrespond to operators of dimension \u03b4 \u223c R/ls \u223c (gY2 M N )1/4 . So the dimension of this\n\noperator should at least be of this order of magnitude at strong 't Hooft coupling. In fact,\n\nthe Yang Mills theory contains many operators with higher spin, like tr[\u03c6I \u2202(\u03bci * * * \u2202\u03bcs ) \u03c6i ].\nThese operators have dimension 2+s at weak coupling but they should also get dimensions\nof order (gY2 M N )1/4 at strong coupling since the gravity theory only contains fields of spin\n3\n\nThere are four distinct orientifolds, one gives SO(2N), one gives SO(2N+1) and the other\n\ntwo give two versions of the Sp(N) theory [16].\n\n16\n\n\fless than two. In any theory that has a weakly coupled gravity dual, with a radius of\ncurvature much bigger than the string scale, operators with higher spin should have large\ndimensions.\nThe problem of solving the Laplace equation with fixed boundary condition is rather\nfamiliar from electrostatics. It is useful to introduce the bulk to boundary propagator,\nwhich is the solution of the problem where we put a boundary condition that is a delta\nfunction at a point on the boundary. In this context this bulk to boundary propagator is\n[10]\nG\u2206 (z, ~x, ~x\u2032 ) =\n\nz\u2206\n[(~x \u2212 ~x\u2032 )2 + z 2 ]\u2206\n\n(4.10)\n\nWe can use this to compute connected correlation functions. For example if we wanted to\ncompute the connected three point function then we would have to include possible cubic\nterms in the action for the scalar field\nZ\n2\n(\u2207\u03c6)2 + m2 R2 \u03c62 + \u03c63 + * * *\nS=N\nx1\n\n(4.11)\n\nx2\n\nx3\n\nFig. 12: Diagram contributing to a three point function. The vertex is a \u03c63 interaction in the bulk theory. The lines going to the boundary are bulk to boundary\npropagators.\n\nWe need to evaluate the diagram in fig. 12. This leads to the following expression for\nthe three point function\nZ\n\nd4 xdz\nG\u22061 (z, x, x1 )G\u22062 (z, x, x2 )G\u22063 (z, x, x3 )\nz5\n\n(4.12)\n\nwith G as in (4.10). This integral gives, of course, the x dependence for a three point function that we expect on the basis of conformal invariance. Remember that in a conformal\ninvariant theory the two and three point function are given by\nhOOi =\n\n1\n|x1 \u2212 x2 |2\u2206\n17\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fhO1 O2 O3 i =\n\n|x1 \u2212 x2\n\n|\u22061 +\u22062 \u2212\u22063 |x\n\nC123\n\u2206 +\u22062 \u2212\u22061 |x \u2212 x |\u22061 +\u22063 \u2212\u22062\n3 \u2212 x2 | 3\n1\n3\n\n(4.14)\n\nIndeed the integral (4.12) gives (4.14), with \u2206i = \u2206 [17].\nNormally we can normalize the two point functions to one. There are some special\ntwo point functions for which the normalization is unambiguously defined. An example is\nthe two point function of the stress tensor. This two point function is proportional to N 2\nwith a coefficient that agrees in gravity and field theory. In fact this coefficient does not\ndepend on the coupling due to a supersymmetry argument [18].\n4.2. Various remarks\nNote that when we solve the equation (4.4) we need to impose two boundary conditions\nsince it is a second order equation. One is the one we discussed so far. The second is that\nit should vanish as z \u2192 \u221e. This corresponds to the statement that there is nothing\n\nspecial happening at infinity. In Euclidean AdS the point z = \u221e is actually a point on the\nboundary. In general, when we solve the equation we need to impose the condition that\nthe solution is not singular in the interior, this gives us the second boundary condition.\nNote also that the renormalization in (4.6) is independent of p (or x). This is related\nto the fact that the dual theory is an ordinary local quantum field theory where the\nrenormalization of an operator does not depend on the momentum. In other theories such\nas in linear dilaton backgrounds, or in non-commutative field theories, this is no longer\ntrue [19] .\nThe fact that the theory on the boundary is local implies that the theory in the bulk\nshould contain gravity. By the word \"local\" we mean that the theory contains a stress\ntensor. This in turn means that the theory can be defined on any manifold.\nIt is possible to have fields with negative mass squared in AdS5 as long as the mass\nobeys\nm2 R2 \u2265 \u22124\n\n(4.15)\n\nThese tachyons do not lead to instabilities and actually appear in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . They do\n\nnot lead to instabilities because normalizable wavefunctions in global AdS, have positive\nenergy. This is due to the fact that the wavefunction has to decrease as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, which\n\nimplies that it should have some kinetic energy which overwhelms the negative potential\nenergy. These fields correspond to relevant operators. In fact, one can see that \u03b1\u2212 is\npositive. This means that the perturbation they induce, which goes as \u03c6 \u223c z \u03b1\u2212 , decreases\n18\n\n\fas z \u2192 0, which is the UV of the field theory4 . Note also that a field of zero mass\n\ncorresponds to a marginal deformation and in this case \u03b1\u2212 = 0 so that the perturbation\nproduced by the operator is independent of z. Finally, if m > 0, the perturbation increases\nas z \u2192 0. This corresponds to an irrelevant operator.\nThe conformal group has a very special representation at \u2206 = 1. Unitarity implies\nthat the corresponding operator corresponds to a free field in R4 . These operators arise in\nthe U (1) factor of the field theory. This is the U (1) in U (N ), the operator is T r[\u03c6I ]. These\nrepresentations of the conformal group are called singletons. They are special because they\ndo not correspond to an ordinary field propagating in the bulk. They should have no local\ndegrees of freedom in the bulk, only on the boundary. Another example is the operator\nT r[F\u03bc\u03bd ]. It corresponds in the bulk to the l = 0 modes of the RR and NS B\u03bc\u03bd fields.\nThese fields have a long distance action governed by\nN\n\nZ\n\nB NS \u2227 dB RR\n\n(4.16)\n\nThis is purely topological and gives rise to a field on the boundary if we put local boundary\nconditions [21] [22].\n4.3. Physics of the warp factor\nLet us try to understand the role of the radial coordinate z in the bulk theory. It is\nvery important that the metric contains a redshift factor, or warp5 factor that multiplies\nthe metric\nds2 = w(z)2 (dx2 + dz 2 ) ,\n\nw(z) =\n\n1\nz\n\n(4.17)\n\nThe distances and times in the field theory are measured with the coordinates x. On\nthe other hand proper times and proper distances in the bulk are related to the field\ntheory coordinates by the warp factor w \u223c 1/z. So a given object in the bulk, such as a\n4\n\nFor some of these fields one sometimes effectively imposes the boundary conditions on the\n\nsolution that decreases faster so that their dimension is equal to \u03b1\u2212 instead of (4.7)[20]. This\nchange in the boundary condition is not needed for N = 4 YM but it is needed for some other\ntheories.\n5\n\nA redshift factor multiplies dt and a warp factor is basically a redshift factor which multiplies\n\nseveral spacetime coordinates so that we have Poincare invariance.\n\n19\n\n\fmassive string state, corresponds to field theory configurations of different size and energy\ndepending on the value of the z coordinate of the bulk object. We have\nEF T = w(z)Eproper\n(size)F T =\nwhere the\n\nFT\n\n(4.18)\n\n1\n(proper size)\nw(z)\n\n(4.19)\n\nsubindex indicates a quantity in the field theory.\n\nSo we see that as we go to z \u2192 0 we have very small sizes in the field theory and very\n\nhigh energies. This is the UV of the field theory. Notice that going to small z corresponds\n\nto going to large distances from a point in the interior. In fact UV divergences in the\nfield theory are related to IR divergences in the gravity theory [23]. The fact that short\ndistances in the field theory correspond to long distances in the gravity description is called\nthe \"IR/UV correspondence\".\n\nZ1\n\nZ2\nZ3\n\nZ3\nZ1\n\nZ2\n\nZ\n\nZ=0\nFig. 13: The same bulk object at different z positions corresponds to an object\nin the CFT with different sizes.\n\nThe physics of the warp factor is also responsible for pointlike, or partonic, behavior\nof scattering amplitudes [24].\n\n5. Thermal aspects\nConsider black holes in AdS. The five sphere will not play an important role so we\nwill not write it explicitly. In Poincare coordinates the simplest black hole is a black brane\nwhich is translation invariant along the three spatial directions of the boundary. The\nmetric has the form\nds2 = R2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n4\n\n\uf8f9\n\n2\n\n1 \uf8f0\ndz\nz\n\uf8fb\n\u2212(1 \u2212 4 )dt2 + d~x2 +\n4\n2\nz\nz0\n(1 \u2212 zz4 )\n0\n\n20\n\n(5.1)\n\n\fThe temperature is easily determined by going to Euclidean time and choosing a periodicity\nfor Euclidean time to that there is no singularity at z = z0 . We see that this gives \u03b2 = \u03c0z0 .\nWe can compute the entropy using the Bekenstein Hawking formula S =\n\n(Area)\n4GN\n\nand\n\nwe get the entropy per unit volume [25]\nS\n\u03c02 2 3\n=\nN T\n(5.2)\nV\n2\nThe weakly coupled field theory has entropy per unit volume\n4 \u03c02 2 3\nS\n=\nN T\n(5.3)\nV\n3 2\nNote that the temperature dependence is determined by conformal invariance. Note\nalso that these black branes have positive specific heat.\nThe N dependence (for fixed g 2 N ) is as we expect from large N counting. In principle\none might have expected extra g 2 N dependence at strong coupling, but we see that at very\nstrong coupling the answer (5.2) becomes independent of g 2 N . Remember that we said\nthat all gravity computations are independent of g 2 N . We see that the numerical coefficient\nis different. This is not surprising since this is not a protected computation and the answer\ncould depend on the coupling g 2 N . In fact the leading g 2 N correction to (5.3) has been\ncomputed [26]. The first \u03b1\u2032 correction to the gravity result (5.2) has also been computed,\n3\n\nit comes from an R4 term and is proportional to \u03b1\u2032 \u223c (g 2 N )\u22123/2 [27]. Both corrections\n\ngo in the right direction but nobody has computed yet the whole interpolating curve. In\nother words, we expect a behavior of the form\nS\n\n\u03c02\nN 2T 3V\n2\n\n4\n3\n\n1\ng2 N\n1\n\nFig. 14: Form of the Yang Mills free energy as a function of the 't Hooft coupling\nin the large N limit. The doted line is a naive interpolation between the weakly\ncoupled and the strongly coupled results.\n\nIf we consider AdS in global coordinates then we can consider solutions that correspond to localized black holes sitting at the center. If the Schwarzschild radius of these\nblack holes is very large, larger than the radius of AdS, then they behave as the black\nbranes we discussed above, but with the R3 directions replaced by S 3 . On the other\nhand if their radius is much smaller than the radius of AdS they behave more as ordinary\nSchwarzschild black holes in flat space. They have negative specific heat and are unstable.\nIt would be nice to find their precise description in the gauge theory.\n21\n\n\f5.1. Wilson Loops\nA very interesting operator in gauge theories is\nH\nA\nW (C) = T r[P e C ]\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere C is a closed curve in R4 . The trace can be taken in any representation, but we\nwill take it in the fundamental representation. This operator represents the Yang Mills\ncontribution to the propagation of a heavy quark in the fundamental representation.\nThe general large N counting arguments that we reviewed above tell us that a quark\nin the fundamental will have a string ending on it. So we expect to have a string worldsheet\nwith a boundary along the contour C. As usual this worldsheet lives in 5 dimensions and\nends on the boundary along C.\n\n\u00062\nWorld Sheet\nFig. 15: String worldsheet ending on the contour C corresponding to the trajectory\nof a heavy external quark.\n\nIn AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 we also have to specify at what point of S 5 the string is sitting when\n\nit approaches the boundary. In fact the operator that corresponds to a string at a specific\npoint on S 5 has the form [28] [29]\nH\nW = tr[P e\n\nA\u03bc dx\u03bc +|dx|\u03c6I (x)\u03b8I\n\n]\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere \u03c6I are the scalar fields of N = 4 YM and \u03b8 is a unit vector, \u03b8 2 = 1, which specifies\na point on S 5 .\n\nFor large g 2 N the leading contribution to the expectation value of the Wilson operator\nis of the form\n\n\u221a\n2\nhW i \u223c e\u2212T (Area) \u223c e\u2212 g N(Area)R=1\n\nNote that we have a factor of 1/\u03b1\u2032 in the exponent. This has explicit\nbecause it involves a string, it goes beyond the supergravity fields.\n22\n\n(5.6)\np\n\ng 2 N dependence\n\n\fThe area in (5.6) is the proper area in the five (or ten) dimensional space. It is infinite\nsince we have already seen that the proper distance to the boundary is infinite, as is the\narea. We need to regularize the expression and compute the area up to z = \u01eb. Then we\nfind that the area goes as\nArea =\n\n(length)\n+ Ar + o(\u01eb)\n\u01eb\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere Ar is finite and can be called the renormalized area. The divergent term is proportional to the length of the contour C. This just renormalizes the mass of the external\nquark.\nThe simplest example is a circular contour where we get that Ar is a negative constant.\nThe result is independent of the size of the circle due to conformal invariance. In fact,\nfor a circular contour there is a trick that enables us to do the exact computation [30]\n[31]. This trick is based on the observation that the straight line would give zero since it\ncorresponds to a BPS state. But the circle is related to the straight line by a conformal\ntransformation. The mapping of the point at infinity is subtle so all the contribution comes\nfrom an anomaly in the transformation [31]. From this exact answer one can see that in\nthe limit of large g 2 N we get the right answer.\nAnother simple example is the computation of a quark anti-quark potential which can\nbe obtained by considering a rectangular contour. This gives\nV = \u2212c1\n\np\n\ngY2 M N\nL\n\n(5.8)\n\nwhere c1 is a numerical constant. The dependence on L follows from conformal invariance.\nThe weak coupling result is\nV = \u2212c2\n\ngY2 M N\nL\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere c2 is a numerical constant. Even though the Yang Mills theory has a string description the theory is not confining. (We will later see examples of confining theories). The\nreason this happens is because the string moves in five dimensions. The Wilson loop obeys\nthe area law, but in 5-dimensions!\n23\n\n\fSmall\nWarp\nFa tor\n\nL1 L2\n\nFig. 16: String configurations relevant for computing the quark-anti-quark potential. As we separate the quarks the string moves into a region with smaller warp\nfactor, which makes the renormalized area smaller.\n\nThe potential decreases when we increase L because the string moves into the region\nof large z where the warp factor is smaller, so that its proper renormalized area is smaller,\nsee fig. 16.\n\n6.\n\nConfining theories\nHere we will consider the simplest example of a confining theory [32]. We start with\n\n3+1 dimensional N = 4 Yang Mills and compactify it on a circle of radius ry down to 2 + 1\n\ndimensions. So the theory is on the space R2+1 \u00d7 S 1 . If we choose antiperiodic boundary\n\nconditions on the circle we will break supersymmetry. From the 2+1 dimensional point of\nview the fermions will be massive. Through quantum corrections, which are large if g 2 N is\nlarge, the bosons will also get a mass. So the only massless fields will be the gauge bosons.\nSo we have a pure Yang Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions at low energies. This theory is\nconfining.\nThe supergravity description of this theory can be obtained in a simple way from our\nprevious solution (5.1). This Euclidean black hole corresponds to the Euclidean field theory\nwith one direction compact with an antiperiodic boundary condition for the fermions in\nthis compact direction. We can then go back to Lorentzian signature by taking time to\nbe one of the non-compact coordinates. The resulting metric is a double wick rotation of\n(5.1)\nds2 = R2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n4\n\n\uf8f9\n\n2\n\n1 \uf8f0\nz\ndz\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\uf8fb\n\u2212dt\n+\ndx\n+\ndx\n+\n(1\n\u2212\n)dy\n+\n4\n1\n2\n4\nz2\nz0\n(1 \u2212 zz4 )\n\n(6.1)\n\n0\n\nwhere we have suppressed the five sphere which will not play a role in our discussion. Now\ny = y + 2\u03c0ry and z0 = 2ry is determined by demanding that (6.1) is nonsingular. Note\nthat the topology of the boundary of (6.1) is S 1 \u00d7 R2+1 and the topology of the full space\n24\n\n\fis D2 \u00d7 R2+1 . So the circle is contractible in the full space. The radial direction z together\n\nwith the circle y have the topology of a disk.\n\nThe crucial property of (6.1) is that the space terminates in the large z direction and\nthe warp factor is bounded below, w(z) \u2265 w(z0 ) \u223c 1/z0 . Notice that the metric (6.1) does\n\nnot have a horizon. A particle moving in the metric (6.1) feels a gravitational force towards\nz = z0 . So the lowest energy states live at z = z0 , the region of space where the warp\n\nfactor is smallest. In fact, once we go to the quantum theory we expect that even massless\nparticles get a non-zero mass due to the fact that they are moving in this gravitational\npotential well which forces the wavefunction to vary in the z direction since a normalizable\nwavefunction should go to zero at the boundary, z \u2192 0. In fact, all excitations on this\ngeometry have positive mass from the 2 + 1 dimensional point of view.\n\nIn order to find the 1 + 2 dimensional particle spectrum we start from the five dimensional fields, let us say a scalar field of mass m. We then solve the classical equation\n1\n\u221a\n|g 00 |\u03c9 2 \u03c6 + \u221a \u2202z ( gg zz \u2202z \u03c6) \u2212 m2 R2 \u03c6 = 0\ng\n\n(6.2)\n\nFor simplicity we assumed that \u03c6 is independent of y. This equation should be solved with\nthe boundary condition that it vanishes as z \u2192 0 and that it is regular at z = z0 , which\n\nmeans \u2202z \u03c6|z0 = 0. So we really have an eigenvalue equation, i.e. the equation with these\nboundary conditions can have a non-zero solution only for special values of \u03c9 2 . These\n\nspecial values are the masses of the particles in 2 + 1 dimensions. By multiplying by \u03c6 and\na suitable power of z and integrating (6.2) it is possible to see that the w2 eigenvalues are\nstrictly positive. This can also be shown for the tachyons that we have in AdS.\nSo we see that the theory has a mass gap. i.e. all excitations have positive mass. This\nis a property we expect in confining theories. Note that these particles are glueballs from\nthe point of view of the boundary theory. These have masses of the order of the mass gap,\ni.e. of order\nM \u223c 1/z0 \u223c 1/ry\n\n(6.3)\n\nThe fact that the warp factor is bounded below also implies that the Wilson loop will\nnow lead to an area law in the boundary theory. What happens is that the string will sit\nat z = z0 and it will have a finite tension there. I cannot move to a region where the warp\nfactor is smaller.\n25\n\n\fBoundary\nZ=0\n\nZ = Z0\n\nFig. 17: String configuration relevant for the computation of the Wilson loop in\na confining theory. Since the warp factor is bounded below we have a finite string\ntension from the boundary theory point of view.\n\nThe string tension from the point of view of the boundary theory is of order\np\ng2N\n1\nT = \u2032 w(z0 )2 \u223c\n\u03b1\nry2\n\n(6.4)\n\n6.1. Confinement-deconfinement transition\nConsider now this 2 + 1 theory at finite temperature. In the Euclidean description we\ncompactify time with period \u03b2. Going back to the 4d theory we now see that the theory\nis on the space R2 \u00d7 S\u03b21 \u00d7 Sr1y , so that we have two circles. Then there are two Euclidean\n\ngravity solutions. We can take the above solution (6.1) and compactify Euclidean time.\nOr we could take the same type of solution but exchanging the two circles and adjusting\nz0 appropriately. This gives two different ways of matching a five dimensional geometry\nto our four dimensional boundary. In the first solution the y circle is contractible but the\nEuclidean time circle is not. The opposite is true in the other solution. The first solution\ncorresponds to just considering the original 5d space (6.1) at finite temperature, so we\nwill excite thermally some of the particles we had discussed above. This is the solution\nthat has lowest free energy at low temperatures. On the other hand the solution where\nthe Euclidean time direction is contractible corresponds to having a black brane of the\ntype we discussed above. This solution has lower free energy at high temperatures. There\nis a critical temperature at which they have the same free energy. At this temperature\nwe have a first order phase transition. In this simple case the symmetries of the problem\nimply that the critical temperature is at \u03b2c = 2\u03c0ry . This is the confinement-deconfinement\nphase transition. It is of first order because the entropy changes dramatically. In the low\ntemperature phase we have an entropy independent of N , we only excite color neutral\nglueballs whose spectrum is N independent. The high temperature phase has an entropy\ngiven by the Hawking Bekenstein formula which is proportional to N 2 . We interpret this\nas saying that now the gluons can move independently.\n26\n\n\fNote that in order to get this piece of physics correctly it was important to sum over\nall geometries which are asymptotic to a given boundary. This is a general principle in\nthe duality. The choice of theory, i.e. the choice of Lagrangian, only fixes the boundary\nconditions of the gravity solution. Then we have to sum over all geometries with these\nboundary conditions. The leading contribution comes, of course, from classical solutions.\nIn some situations there are several classical solutions. We should sum over all of them.\nThe one with the lowest action will contribute the most. We have phase transitions when\none dominates over the other. These are generically large N phase transitions, which can\nhappen even in finite volume. Whether they are bona-fide phase transitions at finite N\nhas to be thought about more carefully.\nIs this really a solution for the pure bosonic Yang Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions?. Not\nreally. The reason is the following. Bosonic Yang Mills theory in 2+1 has a dimensionfull\ncoupling g32 N . This theory is expected to have a confinement scale of order \u039b \u223c g32 N . On\n\nthe other hand if this theory arises as the low energy limit of some other theory, then this\ndescription in terms of 2 + 1 Yang Mills is quite reasonable if the scale of the new physics,\nlet us call it \u039bUV is\n\u039bUV \u226b \u039b = g32 N\n\n(6.5)\n\nThis means that the theory is weakly coupled for energies in between \u039b and \u039bUV . In our\ncase the three dimensional coupling that we obtain from dimensionally reducing the 4d\ntheory is\ng32 N =\n\ng2N\nry\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhile the scale at which we have new physics is 1/ry \u223c \u039bUV . We see that we can never\nobey (6.5) if we want to trust supergravity, which requires g 2 N \u226b 1.\n\nSo the theory that supergravity is describing is a confining theory but it is not pure\n\n2 + 1 Yang Mills.\nThere are many examples of confining theories in four dimensions. Some are supersymmetric N = 1 theories that are confining [33]. See M. Strassler's lectures.\n\nTheories that have large radius supergravity duals are special. For example glueballs\n\nof spin greater than two will be much more massive than the lightest glueballs. Similarly\nthe string tension will be much larger than the mass scale set by the lightest glueball,\nas we can see from (6.3)(6.4). It is believed that in large N bosonic Yang Mills in four\ndimensions these two scales are of the same order. This would imply that the theory does\nnot have a large radius gravity dual. We expect a dual description in terms of strings\nmoving on a space whose curvature is of the order of the string scale.\n27\n\n\f6.2. Remarks about more general field theories\nMany theories have gravity duals and they do not need to be conformal. For local\nquantum field theories the corresponding gravity solution has the feature that the warp\nfactor becomes large towards the boundary. If the theory is free in the UV, then the\ngeometry becomes singular as the boundary is approached, the radius of curvature in\nstring units becomes very small.\nIf a CFT is deformed by adding some relevant operators to the Lagrangian then there\ncan be interesting effects in the IR. A simple possibility is that the theory flows in the IR\nto another CFT. In some cases people have found interpolating solutions that start as one\nAdS space near the boundary and end as another AdS space in the IR region [34]. One\ncan prove that the supergravity equations imply that the radius of curvature in 5d Planck\nunits of the AdS space decreases as you flow to the IR. This is a supergravity c theorem\n[34][35].\nIf the theory is confining, then one typically finds that the space ends as you go into\nthe interior and that the warp factor is bounded below. How precisely it ends depends on\nthe theory under consideration. It can end in a purely geometric way, as we saw above, or\nthere can be some branes [36].\n6.3. D-branes in the bulk\nWe have a U (N ) theory on the boundary. But the U (1) is a free factor. The physics\nin the interior of the bulk is really described by the SU(N) piece. In SU(N) N quarks can\ncombine into a neutral object. In the bulk we can have N fundamental strings that end\non a D5 brane that is wrapping the S 5 [16].\nNormally we cannot have a fundamental string ending on a brane with compact volume\nsince the endpoints of fundamental strings act as electric charges for the U (1) gauge field\nliving on the D-brane worldvolume. Of course we could have a string ending and one\n\"departing\", the orientation is important.\nHowever, there is an interesting coupling on the D5 worldvolume of the form\nZ\nZ\n6\nSbrane \u223c d xA \u2227 F5 \u223c N dtA0\n\n(6.7)\n\nwhere A is the worldvolume gauge field. This is saying that the 5-form field strength\ninduces N units of background electric charge on the 5-brane. This can be cancelled by N\nstrings that end on it.\n28\n\n\fIn other theories, which have dynamical quarks, we can have baryons as states in the\ntheory.\nNote that if we add flavors to the field theory we will get D-branes that are extended\nalong all 5 dimensions of AdS. The open strings living on them are the mesons. The gauge\nfields living on them are associated to flavor symmetries.\nNote that gauge symmetries in the bulk correspond to global symmetries in the boundary theory. In a gravitational theory only gauged symmetries have associated conserved\ncharges.\n\n7.\n\nThe plane wave limit of AdS/CFT\nOther reviews of this subject can be found in [5].\n\n7.1. Plane waves\nPlane waves are spacetimes of the form\nds2 = \u22122dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 Aij (x+ )y i y j (dx+ )2 + d~y 2\n\n(7.1)\n\nThe index i = 1, * * * , D \u2212 2. These spacetimes have many isometries. One is obvious, \u2202\u2212 .\n\nTo describe the other ones let us assume for the moment that there is only one coordinate\ny and call A11 = \u03bc2 . Then the other isometries have the form\na \u2261 \u03b6(x+ )\u2202y + \u03b6\u0307(x+ )y\u2202\u2212\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere \u03b6(x+ ) is a complex solution of the equation\n\u03b6\u0308 + \u03bc2 (x+ )\u03b6 = 0\n\n(7.3)\n+\n\nIn the particular case that \u03bc > 0 is constant a simple solution is \u03b6 = e\u2212i\u03bcx . Since \u03b6 is\ncomplex there are two isometries in (7.2) the other is the complex conjugate a\u2020 = a\u2217 . We\ncan normalize the solution of (7.3) so that the commutator of these two isometries is\n[a, a\u2020 ] = i\u2202\u2212 = \u2212p\u2212\n\n(7.4)\n\nIf we have n y coordinates, then we have n a, a\u2020 pairs.\nThe fact that the space has many isometries enables us to find the solution of the\ngeodesic equation and also enables us to separate the Klein Gordon equation.\n29\n\n\fLet us see this more explicitly. The action for a particle is\nZ\n1\nd\u03c4 [e\u22121 \u1e8a \u03bc \u1e8a \u03bd g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m2 e]\nS=\n2\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nm2\n1\n2\n2 2\n+\n(\u2212p\u2212 )(\u1e8f \u2212 \u03bc y ) \u2212\ndx\nS=\n2\n(\u2212p\u2212 )\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhere in the last line we have chosen lightcone gauge x+ = \u03c4 , found the conserved quantity\np\u2212 = \u2212e\u22121 and plugged it back into the action. Note that p\u2212 \u2264 0. The Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to the action (7.5) is H = i\u2202+ = \u2212p+ . We see that we get a harmonic\n\noscillator, possibly with time dependent frequency. If \u03bc is constant we get an ordinary\n\nharmonic oscillator. Note that \u03bc2 can be negative in some plane waves. In fact, if the\nmetric (7.1) is a solution of the vacuum Einstein equations then the trace of Aij is zero,\nso that there are both positive and negative eigenvalues. This correspond to the fact that\ntidal forces are focusing in one direction and defocusing in others.\nThe Klein Gordon equation for a field of mass m can also be solved by taking solutions\nwith fixed p\u2212 and then writing the equation for constant \u03bc as\ni\u2202+ \u03c6 = \u03bc(a\u2020 a + 1/2)\u03c6 +\n\nm2\n\u03c6\n2(\u2212p\u2212 )\n\n(7.6)\n\nFor simplicity we consider only one y coordinate. If \u03bc is x+ independent then the spectrum\nis\n\nm2\n1\n\u2212p+ = \u03bc(n + ) +\n2\n2(\u2212p\u2212 )\n\n(7.7)\n\nThe ground state energy is 1/2 (per dimension) for a scalar field, but it has other values\nof higher spin fields.\nPeople who work in the lightcone gauge sometimes prefer to use p+ and p\u2212 . In our\ncase since we are in a curved space it is more convenient to stick with p\u00b1 and live with the\ninconvenience that they are typically negative, p\u2212 is always negative.\nIt turns out that string theory is also solvable on plane waves. We will discuss only\none example.\n7.2. Type IIB supergravity plane wave\nWe will be interested in the following plane wave solution of IIB supergravity [37]\nds2 = \u22122dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 y 2 (dx+ )2 + dy i dy i\n30\n\n(7.8)\n\n\fwith a constant field strength\nF = dx+ (dy1 dy2 dy3 dy4 + dy5 dy6 dy7 dy8 )\n\n(7.9)\n\nString propagation on this background can be solved exactly. by choosing light cone gauge\nin the Green-Schwarz action [38,39]. The lightcone action becomes\n1\nS=\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\ndt\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 |p\u2212 |\n\nd\u03c3\n\n0\n\n2\n1 \u20322\n1 2 2\n2 \u1e8f \u2212 2 y \u2212 2 \u03bc y + iS\u0304(6 \u2202 + \u03bcI)S\n\n\u00021\n\n\u0003\n\n(7.10)\n\nwhere I = \u03931234 and S is a Majorana spinor on the worldsheet and a positive chirality\nSO(8) spinor under rotations in the eight transverse directions. We quantize this action\nby expanding all fields in Fourier modes on the circle labeled by \u03c3. For each Fourier mode\nwe get a harmonic oscillator (bosonic or fermionic depending on the field). Then the light\ncone Hamiltonian is\n\u2212p+ = Hlc =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nNn\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\ns\n\n\u03bc2 +\n\nn2\n(\u03b1\u2032 |p\u2212 |/2)2\n\n(7.11)\n\nHere n is the label of the Fourier mode, n > 0 label left movers and n < 0 right movers. Nn\ndenotes the total occupation number of that mode, including bosons and fermions. Note\nthat the ground state energy of bosonic oscillators is canceled by that of the fermionic\noscillators. The constraint on the momentum in the sigma direction reads\nP =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnNn = 0\n\n(7.12)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nIn the limit that \u03bc is very small, \u03bc\u03b1\u2032 |p\u2212 | \u226a 1, we recover the flat space spectrum. It\n\nis also interesting to consider the opposite limit, where\n\u03bc\u03b1\u2032 p+ \u226b 1\n\n(7.13)\n\nThis limit corresponds to strong tidal forces on the strings, i.e. to strong curvatures. In\nthis limit all the low lying string oscillator modes have almost the same energy. This limit\ncorresponds to a highly curved background with RR fields. In fact we will later see that\nthe appearance of a large number of light modes is expected from the Yang-Mills theory.\nIn this limit different pieces of the string move independently.\n31\n\n\fls\n\n\u03bc \u03b1\u2032 P\u2212 >> 1\n\n\u03bc \u03b1\u2032 P\u2212 << 1\n\nMassive Particles\non the String\nWorld Sheet\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 18: Strings moving in a plane wave.

Type IIB plane wave from AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nIn this subsection we obtain the maximally supersymmetric plane wave of type IIB\nstring theory as a limit of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 . This is a so called \"Penrose\" limit. It consists on\n\nfocusing on the spacetime region near a lightlike geodesic.\n\nThe idea is to consider the trajectory of a particle that is moving very fast along the\n5\n\nS and to focus on the geometry that this particle sees. See fig. 19.\nWe start with the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 metric written as\nh\ni\n2\nds2 = R2 \u2212dt2 cosh2 \u03c1 + d\u03c12 + sinh2 \u03c1d\u03a923 + d\u03c8 2 cos2 \u03b8 + d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03a9\u2032 3\n\n(7.14)\n\nWe want to consider a particle moving along the \u03c8 direction and sitting at \u03c1 = 0 and\n\u03b8 = 0. We will focus on the geometry near this trajectory. We can do this systematically\nby introducing coordinates x\u0303\u2212 = t \u2212 \u03c8, x+ = t and then performing the rescaling\nx\u2212 = R2 x\u0303\u2212 ,\n\n\u03c1=\n\nr\n,\nR\n32\n\n\u03b8=\n\ny\n,\nR\n\nR\u2192\u221e\n\n(7.15)\n\n\fand x+ is not rescaled. x\u2212 , r, y are kept fixed as R \u2192 \u221e. In this limit the metric (7.14)\nbecomes [40]\n\nds2 = \u22122dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 (~r\n\n2\n\n+ ~y 2 )(dx+ )2 + d~y\n\n2\n\n+ d~r\n\n2\n\n(7.16)\n\nwhere ~y and ~r parametrize points on R4 . We can also see that only the components of F\nwith a plus index survive the limit. The mass parameter \u03bc can be introduced by rescaling\nx\u2212 \u2192 x\u2212 /\u03bc and x+ \u2192 \u03bcx+ in eqn. (7.15). These solutions were studied in [37].\n\nIt will be convenient for us to understand how the energy and angular momentum\n\nalong \u03c8 scale in the limit (7.15). The energy in global coordinates in AdS is given by\nE = i\u2202t and the angular momentum by J = \u2212i\u2202\u03c8 . This angular momentum generator\ncan be thought of as the generator that rotates the 56 plane of R6 .\n7.4. The \"plane wave\" limit in gauge theory variables\nIn terms of the dual CFT these are the energy and R-charge of a state of the field\ntheory on S 3 \u00d7 R where the S 3 has unit radius. Alternatively, we can say that E = \u2206 is\n\nthe conformal dimension of an operator on R4 . We find that\n\u2212p+ =i\u2202x+ = i(\u2202t + \u2202\u03c8 ) = \u2206 \u2212 J\n\u2212p\u2212 = \u2212\n\n1\nJ\n1\np\u0303\u2212\n= 2 i\u2202x\u0303\u2212 = 2 i(\u2212\u2202\u03c8 ) = 2\n2\nR\nR\nR\nR\n\n(7.17)\n\nConfigurations with fixed non zero p\u2212 in the limit (7.15) correspond to states in AdS\n\nwith large momentum along the S 5 , or large R charge in the field theory, J \u223c R2 \u223c\n(gN )1/2 . It is useful also to rewrite (7.11) in terms of the Yang Mills parameters. Then\nwe find that the contribution of each oscillator to \u2206 \u2212 J is\nr\n4\u03c0gs N n2\n(\u2206 \u2212 J)n = wn = 1 +\nJ2\n\n(7.18)\n\nNotice that gs N/J 2 remains fixed in the gs N \u2192 \u221e limit that we are taking.\n\nWhen we perform the rescalings (7.15) we can perform the limit in two ways. If we\n\nwant to get the plane wave with finite string coupling then we take the N \u2192 \u221e limit\n\nkeeping the string coupling gs fixed and we focus on operators with J \u223c N 1/2 and \u2206 \u2212 J\n\nfixed.\n\nOn the other hand we could first take the 't Hooft limit g \u2192 0, gN =fixed, and then\n\u221a\nafter taking this limit, we take the limit of large 't Hooft coupling keeping J/ gN fixed\nand \u2206 \u2212 J fixed. Taking the limit in this fashion gives us a plane wave background with\n33\n\n\fzero string coupling. Since we will be interested in these notes in the free string spectrum\nof the theory it will be more convenient for us to take this second limit. But to consider\nstring interactions we need to consider the first.\nFrom this point of view it is clear that the full supersymmetry algebra of the metric\n(7.14) is a contraction of that of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [37]. This algebra implies that p\u00b1 \u2264 0.\n7.5. Strings from N = 4 Super Yang Mills\nAfter taking the 't Hooft limit, we are interested in the limit of large 't Hooft coupling\n\u221a\ngN \u2192 \u221e. We want to consider states which carry parametrically large R charge J \u223c gN .\n6\n\nThis R charge generator, J, is the SO(2) generator rotating two of the six scalar fields.\n\nWe want to find the spectrum of states with \u2206 \u2212 J finite in this limit. We are interested\n\nin single trace states of the Yang Mills theory on S 3 \u00d7 R, or equivalently, the spectrum of\n\ndimensions of single trace operators of the Euclidean theory on R4 . We will often go back\nand forth between the states and the corresponding operators.\nLet us first start by understanding the operator with lowest value of \u2206 \u2212 J = 0. There\n\nis a unique single trace operator with \u2206 \u2212 J = 0, namely T r[Z J ], where Z \u2261 \u03c65 + i\u03c66 and\n\nthe trace is over the N color indices. We are taking J to be the SO(2) generator rotating\n\nthe plane 56. At weak coupling the dimension of this operator is J since each Z field has\ndimension one. This operator is a chiral primary and hence its dimension is protected\nby supersymmetry. It is associated to the vacuum state in light cone gauge, which is the\nunique state with zero light cone Hamiltonian. In other words we have the correspondence\n\u221a\n\n1\nT r[Z J ] \u21d0\u21d2 |0, p+ il.c.\nJ/2\nJN\n\n(7.19)\n\nWe have normalized the operator as follows. When we compute hT r[Z\u0304 J ](x)T r[Z J ](0)i we\n\nhave J possibilities for the contraction of the first Z\u0304 but then planarity implies that we\ncontract the second Z\u0304 with a Z that is next to the first one we contracted and so on. Each\nof these contraction gives a factor of N . Normalizing this two point function to one we get\nthe normalization factor in (7.19).7\n6\n7\n\nSince we first took the 't Hooft limit then giant gravitons are not important.\nIn general in the free theory any contraction of a single trace operator with its complex\n\nconjugate one will give us a factor of N n , where n is the number of fields appearing in the\noperator.\n\n34\n\n\fNow we can consider other operators that we can build in the free theory. We can\nadd other fields, or we can add derivatives of fields like \u2202(i1 * * * \u2202in ) \u03c6r , where we only take\n\nthe traceless combinations since the traces can be eliminated via the equations of motion.\nThe order in which these operators are inserted in the trace is important. All operators\nare all \"words\" constructed by these fields up to the cyclic symmetry, these were discussed\nand counted in [41]. We will find it convenient to divide all fields, and derivatives of fields,\nthat appear in the free theory according to their \u2206 \u2212 J eigenvalue. There is only one mode\nthat has \u2206 \u2212 J = 0, which is the mode used in (7.19). There are eight bosonic and eight\n\nfermionic modes with \u2206 \u2212 J = 1. They arise as follows. First we have the four scalars in\nthe directions not rotated by J, i.e. \u03c6i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then we have derivatives of the field\n\nZ, Di Z = \u2202i Z + [Ai , Z], where i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are four directions in R4 . Finally there are\neight fermionic operators \u03c7a\n\n1\nJ= 2\n\nwhich are the eight components with J =\n\n1\n2\n\nof the sixteen\n\ncomponent gaugino \u03c7 (the other eight components have J = \u2212 12 ). These eight components\n\ntransform in the positive chirality spinor representation of SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4). We will focus\n\nfirst on operators built out of these fields and then we will discuss what happens when we\ninclude other fields, with \u2206 \u2212 J > 1, such as Z\u0304.\n\nThe state (7.19) describes a particular mode of ten dimensional supergravity in a\n\nparticular wavefunction [10]. Let us now discuss how to generate all other massless supergravity modes. On the string theory side we construct all these states by applying the\nzero momentum oscillators ai0 , i = 1, . . . , 8 and S0b , b = 1, . . . 8 on the light cone vacuum\n|0, p+ il.c. . Since the modes on the string are massive all these zero momentum oscillators\nare harmonic oscillators, they all have the same light cone energy. So the total light cone\n\nenergy is equal to the total number of oscillators that are acting on the light cone ground\nstate. We know that in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 all gravity modes are in the same supermultiplet as the\n\nstate of the form (7.19)[42]. The same is clearly true in the limit that we are considering.\n\nMore precisely, the action of all supersymmetries and bosonic symmetries of the plane\nwave background (which are intimately related to the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 symmetries) generate all\n\nother ten dimensional massless modes with given p\u2212 . For example, by acting by some of\nthe rotations of S 5 that do not commute with the SO(2) symmetry that we singled out we\ncreate states of the form\n1 X\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nT r[Z l \u03c6r Z J\u2212l ] = J/2+1/2 T r[\u03c6r Z J ]\nN\nJ l\nJN J/2+1/2\n35\n\n(7.20)\n\n\fwhere \u03c6r , r = 1, 2, 3, 4 is one of the scalars neutral under J. In (7.20) we used the cyclicity\nof the trace. Note that we have normalized the states appropriately in the planar limit.\nWe can act any number of times by these generators and we get operators roughly of the\nP\nform\nT r[* * * Z\u03c6r Z * * * Z\u03c6k ]. where the sum is over all the possible orderings of the \u03c6s.\nWe can repeat this discussion with the other \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 fields. Each time we insert a new\n\noperator we sum over all possible locations where we can insert it. Here we are neglecting\npossible extra terms that we need when two \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 fields are at the same position,\n\nthese are subleading in a 1/J expansion and can be neglected in the large J limit that we\nare considering. We are also ignoring the fact that J typically decreases when we act with\nthese operators. In other words, when we act with the symmetries that do not leave Z\ninvariant we will change one of the Zs in (7.19) to a field with \u2206 \u2212 J = 1, when we act\n\nagain with one of the symmetries we can change one of the Zs that was left unchanged in\nthe first step or we can act on the field that was already changed in the first step. This\nsecond possibility is of lower order in a 1/J expansion and we neglect it. We will always\n\nwork in a \"dilute gas\" approximation where most of the fields in the operator are Zs and\nthere are a few other fields sprinkled in the operator.\nFor example, a state with two excitations will be of the form\n\u223c\n\nJ\n1 X\n\u221a\nT r[\u03c6r Z l \u03c8 b 1 Z J\u2212l ]\nJ= 2\nN J/2+1 J\nl=0\n\n1\n\n(7.21)\n\nwhere we used the cyclicity of the trace to put the \u03c6r operator at the beginning of the\n\u2020 b\nexpression. We associate (7.21) to the string state a\u2020k\n0 S0 |0, p+ il.c. . Note that for planar\n\ndiagrams it is very important to keep track of the position of the operators. For example,\ntwo operators of the form T r[\u03c61 Z l \u03c62 Z J\u2212l ] with different values of l are orthogonal to each\n\nother in the planar limit (in the free theory).\nThe conclusion is that there is a precise correspondence between the supergravity\nmodes and the operators. This is of course well known [9,10,43]. Indeed, we see from\n(7.11) that their \u2206 \u2212 J = \u2212p+ is indeed what we compute at weak coupling, as we expect\nfrom the BPS argument.\n\nIn order to understand non-supergravity modes in the bulk it is clear that what we\nneed to understand the Yang Mills description of the states obtained by the action of\nthe string oscillators which have n 6= 0. Let us consider first one of the string oscillators\nwhich creates a bosonic mode along one of the four directions that came from the S 5 , let's\nsay a\u2020n 8 . We already understood that the action of a\u20200\n36\n\n8\n\ncorresponds to insertions of an\n\n\foperator \u03c64 on all possible positions along the \"string of Z's\". By a \"string of Zs\" we\njust mean a sequence of Z fields one next to the other such as we have in (7.19). We\n4\npropose that a\u20208\nn corresponds to the insertion of the same field \u03c6 but now with a position\n\ndependent phase\nJ\n2\u03c0inl\n1\n1 X\n\u221a\n\u221a\nT r[Z l \u03c64 Z J\u2212l ]e J\nJ/2+1/2\nJ l=1 JN\n\n(7.22)\n\nIn fact the state (7.22) vanishes by cyclicity of the trace. This corresponds to the fact that\nwe have the constraint that the total momentum along the string should vanish (7.12), so\nthat we cannot insert only one a\u2020n i oscillator. So we should insert more than one oscillator\nso that the total momentum is zero. For example we can consider the string state obtained\nby acting with the a\u2020n 8 and a\u2020\u2212n7 , which has zero total momentum along the string. We\n\npropose that this state should be identified with\n\nJ\n1\n1 X\n3 l 4 J\u2212l 2\u03c0inl\nT\nr[\u03c6\nZ\u03c6 Z\n]e J\na\u2020n 8 a\u2020\u2212n7 |0, p+ il.c. \u21d0\u21d2 \u221a\nJ l=1 N J/2+1\n\n(7.23)\n\nwhere we used the cyclicity of the trace to simplify the expression. The general rule is\npretty clear, for each oscillator mode along the string we associate one of the \u2206 \u2212 J = 1\n\nfields of the Yang-Mills theory and we sum over the insertions of this field at all possible\n\npositions with a phase proportional to the momentum. States whose total momentum is\nnot zero along the string lead to operators that are automatically zero by cyclicity of the\ntrace. In this way we enforce the L0 \u2212 L\u03040 = 0 constraint (7.12) on the string spectrum.\n\nIn summary, each string oscillator corresponds to the insertion of a \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 field,\n\nsumming over all positions with an n dependent phase, according to the rule\na\u2020i \u2212\u2192 Di Z\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , 4\n\na\u2020j \u2212\u2192 \u03c6j\u22124\n\nfor j = 5, * * * , 8\n\n(7.24)\n\nS a \u2212\u2192 \u03c7a\n\n1\nJ= 2\n\nIn order to show that this identification makes sense we want to compute the conformal\ndimension, or more precisely \u2206 \u2212 J, of these operators at large 't Hooft coupling and show\n\nthat it matches (7.11). First note that if we set\n\ngN\nJ2\n\n\u223c 0 in (7.18) we find that all modes,\n\nindependently of n have the same energy, namely one. This is what we find at weak 't\nHooft coupling where all operators of the form (7.23) have the same energy, independently\n37\n\n\fof n. Expanding the string theory result (7.18) we find that the first correction is of the\nform\n(\u2206 \u2212 J)n = wn = 1 +\n\n2\u03c0gN n2\n+***\nJ2\n\n(7.25)\n\nThis looks like a first order correction in the 't Hooft coupling and we can wonder if\nwe can reproduce it by a a simple perturbative computation.\nIn order to compute the corrections it is useful to view the N = 4 theory as an N = 1\n\ntheory. As an N = 1 theory we have a Yang Mills theory plus three chiral multiplets in\n\nthe adjoint representation. We denote these multiplets as W i , where i = 1, 2, 3. We will\noften set Z = W 3 and W = W 1 . The theory also has a superpotential\nW \u223c gY M T r(W i W j W k )\u01ebijk\n\n(7.26)\n\nThe potential for the Yang Mills theory is the sum of two terms, V = VF + VD , one\ncoming from F terms and the other from D-terms.

There are various types\nof diagrams. There are diagrams that come from D terms, as well as from photons or\nself energy corrections. There are also diagrams that come from F terms. The diagrams\nthat come from F terms can exchange the W with the Z. The F term contributions\ncancel in the case that there are no phases, see fig. 20. This means that all other diagrams\nshould also cancel, since in the case that there are no phases we have a BPS object which\nreceives no corrections. All other one loop diagrams that do not come from F terms do\nnot exchange the position of W , this means that they vanish also in the case that there are\nphases since they will be insensitive to the presence of phases. In the presence of phases\nthe only diagrams that will not cancel are then the diagrams that come from the F terms.\nThese are the only diagrams that give a momentum, n, dependent contribution.\nIn the free theory, once a W operator is inserted at one position along the string it\nwill stay there, states with W 's at different positions are orthogonal to each other in the\nplanar limit (up to the cyclicity of the trace). We can think of the string of Zs in (7.19) as\ndefining a lattice, when we insert an operator W at different positions along the string of\nZs we are exciting an oscillator b\u2020l at the site l on the lattice, l = 1, * * * J. The interaction\n\nterm (7.27) can take an excitation from one site in the lattice to the neighboring site. So\n\nwe see that the effects of (7.27) will be sensitive to the momentum n. In fact, one can\nprecisely reproduce (7.25) from (7.27) including the precise numerical coefficient. Below\nwe give some more details on the computation.\nWe will write the square of the Yang-Mills coupling in terms of what in AdS is the\nstring coupling that transforms as g \u2192 1/g under S-duality. The trace is just the usual\ntrace of an N \u00d7 N matrix.\nWe define Z =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03c65\n2\n\n+ i\u03c66 ) and similarly for W . Then the propagator is normalized\n\nas\nhZi j (x)Z\u0304kl (0)i = \u03b4il \u03b4kj\n39\n\n2\u03c0g 1\n4\u03c0 2 |x|2\n\n(7.29)\n\n\fIn (7.27) there is an interaction term of the form the form\n\n1\n\u03c0g\n\nR\n\nd4 xT r([Z, W ][Z\u0304, W\u0304 ]), where\n\nW is one of the (complex) transverse scalars, let's say W = W 1 . The contribution from\nthe F terms shown in (7.27)give\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\u03c0n\nN\n1 + N (4\u03c0g)(\u22122 + 2 cos\n)I(x)\n< O(x)O (0) >=\n|x|2\u2206\nJ\n\u2217\n\n(7.30)\n\nwhere N is a normalization factor and I(x) is the integral\n|x|4\nI(x) =\n(4\u03c0 2 )2\n\nZ\n\nd4 y\n\ny 4 (x\n\n1\n1\n\u223c\nlog |x|\u039b + finite\n4\n\u2212 y)\n4\u03c0 2\n\n(7.31)\n\nWe extracted the log divergent piece of the integral since it is the one that reflects the\nchange in the conformal dimension of the operator.\nIn conclusion we find that for large J and N the first correction to the correlator is\n\u0014\n\u0015\n4\u03c0gN n2\nN\n\u2217\n1\u2212\nlog(|x|\u039b)\n(7.32)\n< O(x)O (0) >=\n|x|2\u2206\nJ2\nwhich implies that the contribution of the operator W inserted in the \"string of Zs\" with\nmomentum n gives a contribution to the anomalous dimension\n2\u03c0gN n2\n(\u2206 \u2212 J)n = 1 +\nJ2\n\n(7.33)\n\nwhich agrees precisely with the first order term computed from (7.25).\nThere are similar computations we could do for insertions of Di Z, W\u0304 or the fermions\n\u03c7aJ=1/2 . In the case of the fermions the important interaction term will be a Yukawa\ncoupling of the form \u03c7\u0304\u0393z [Z\u03c7] + \u03c7\u0304\u0393z\u0304 [Z\u0304, \u03c7]. We have not done these computations explicitly\nsince the 16 supersymmetries preserved by the state (7.19) relate them to the computation\nwe did above for the insertion of a W operator.\nThe full square root in (7.18) was derived in a paper by Santambrogio and Zanon [44],\nsee also [45].\nIn summary, the \"string of Zs\" becomes the physical string and each Z carries one\nunit of J which is one unit of \u2212p\u2212 . Locality along the worldsheet of the string comes from\n\nthe fact that planar diagrams allow only contractions of neighboring operators. So the\nYang Mills theory gives a string bit model (see [46]) where each bit is a Z operator. Each\nbit carries one unit of J which is one unit of \u2212p\u2212 .\n\nThe reader might, correctly, be thinking that all this seems too good to be true. In\n\nfact, we have neglected many other diagrams and many other operators which, at weak 't\n40\n\n\fHooft coupling also have small \u2206 \u2212 J. In particular, we considered operators which arise\nby inserting the fields with \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 but we did not consider the possibility of inserting\n\nfields corresponding to \u2206 \u2212 J = 2, 3, . . ., such as Z\u0304, \u2202k \u03c6r , \u2202(l \u2202k) Z, etc.. The diagrams of\n\nthe type we considered above would give rise to other 1+1 dimensional fields for each of\nthese modes. These are present at weak 't Hooft coupling but they should not be present\nat strong coupling, since we do not see them in the string spectrum. We believe that what\nhappens is that these fields get a large mass in the N \u2192 \u221e limit. In other words, the\noperators get a large conformal dimension. One can compute the first correction to the\nenergy (the conformal weight) of the of the state that results from inserting Z\u0304 with some\n\"momentum\" n. In contrast to our previous computation for \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 fields we find\n\nthat besides an effective kinetic term as in (7.25) there is an n independent contribution\nthat goes as gN with no extra powers of 1/J 2 [11]. This is an indication that these\nexcitations become very massive in the large gN limit. In addition, we can compute the\ndecay amplitude of Z\u0304 into a pair of \u03c6 insertions. This is also very large, of order gN .\nThough we have not done a similar computation for other fields with \u2206 \u2212 J > 1, we\n\nbelieve that the same will be true for the other fields. In general we expect to find many\nterms in the effective Lagrangian with coefficients that are of order gN with no inverse\n\npowers of J to suppress them. In other words, the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills on S 3 acting\non a state which contains a large number of Zs gives a Lagrangian on a discretized spatial\ncircle with an infinite number of KK modes. The coefficients of this effective Lagrangian\nare factors of gN , so all fields will generically get very large masses.\nThe only fields that will not get a large mass are those whose mass is protected for\nsome reason. The fields with \u2206 \u2212 J = 1 correspond to Goldstone bosons and fermions of\n\nthe symmetries broken by the state (7.19). Note that despite the fact that they morally are\nGoldstone bosons and fermions, their mass is non-zero, due to the fact that the symmetries\nthat are broken do not commute with p+ , the light cone Hamiltonian. The point is that\ntheir masses are determined, and hence protected, by the (super)symmetry algebra.\nHaving described how the single string Hilbert space arises it is natural to ask whether\nwe can incorporate properly the string interactions. Clearly string interactions come when\nwe include non-planar diagrams. There has been a lot of recent work relating the string\ninteractions to the leading non-planar contributions in Yang Mills [47].\nFinally we should note that there is another interesting limit where we consider operators with large spin [48]. In this case one finds that for large spin the operators have\n41\n\n\fp\ndimensions \u2206 \u2212 S \u223c (const) g 2 N log S. At weak coupling one has a similar relation but\n\nin front of the logarithm we have a factor of g 2 N .\n\nAcknowledgments:\nIt is a pleasure to thank the local organizers and lecturers of the TASI 03 school.
