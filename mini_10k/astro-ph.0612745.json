The relic cosmic\nneutrinos may cluster in wide Dark Hot Local Group Halo. High Energy ZeV cosmic neutrinos (in Z-Showering\nmodel) might hit relic ones at each mass in different resonance energies in our nearby Universe. This nondegenerated density and energy must split UHE Z-boson secondaries (in Z-Burst model) leading to multi injection\nof UHECR nucleons within future extreme AUGER energy. Secondaries of Z-Burst as neutral gamma, below\na few tens EeV are better surviving local GZK cut-off and they might explain recent Hires BL-Lac UHECR\ncorrelations at small angles. A different high energy resonance must lead to Glashow's anti-neutrino showers\nwhile hitting electrons in matter. In water and ice it leads to isotropic light explosions. In air, Glashow's antineutrino showers lead to collimated and directional air-showers offering a new Neutrino Astronomy. Because\nof neutrino flavor mixing, astrophysical energetic tau neutrino above tens GeV must arise over atmospheric\nbackground. At TeV range is difficult to disentangle tau neutrinos from other atmospheric flavors. At greater\nenergy around PeV, Tau escaping mountains and Earth and decaying in flight are effectively showering in air\nsky.

Such air-showers secondaries\nrelease amplified and beamed gamma bursts (like observed TGF), made also by muon and electron pair bundles,\nwith their accompanying rich Cherenkov flashes. Also planet's largest (Saturn, Jupiter) atmosphere limbs offer\nan ideal screen for UHE GZK and Z-burst tau neutrino, because their largest sizes. Titan thick atmosphere\nand small radius are optimal for discovering up-going resonant Glashow resonant anti-neutrino electron showers.\nDetection from Earth of Tau, anti-Tau, anti-electron neutrino induced Air-showers by twin Magic Telescopes on\ntop mountains, or space based detection on balloons and satellites arrays facing the atmosphere's limbs are the\nsimplest and cheapest way toward UHE Neutrino Astronomy Horizons.\n\nTeVs energies and above, \u03bd\u03c4 Astronomy is noise\nfree. But only at higher energies, E\u03bd\u03c4 \u2265 PeV\nthe \u03bd\u03c4 air showering is well detectable [2]. The\nproblem of \u03c4 neutrinos crossing, interacting external crust and escaping, as UHE \u03c4 , the Earth\n[5] is complicated: the terrestrial neutrino opacity at different energies and angles of arrival, the\n\u03c4 energy losses and its interaction lengths at different energies and materials, makes difficult to\nestimate the expected rate. Such a prediction is\nfurther complicated by the existence of a list of\ntheoretical models for the assumed incoming neutrino fluxes (GZK neutrinos, Z-burst model flux\n(See Fig.1 and [5]), E \u22122 flat spectra, AGN neutrinos, topological defects). Even extreme light\nand non-degenerated neutrino masses may play\na role in UHECR spectra split in multi bump\nand ZeV energy modulations; see Fig 1. Most\n\n1.

Also new net charge single bundle (by HorTaus) are possible at high altitude splitting air-showers (see Fig.3)[5,10].
