The spectral functions for calcium and argon are constructed.

The argon spectral function is then used to obtain the quasielastic neutrino-nucleus\ncross section.\nKeywords: impulse approximation, spectral function, argon, calcium, electron, neutrino\nPACS: 13.15.+g, 25.30.Pt\n\nThe description of lepton-nucleus interactions in the 1 GeV energy region is based on\nthe impulse approximation (IA). The most reliable implementation of the IA is that of\nthe spectral function (SF). Exact calculations of the SF exist only for the lightest nuclei,\nwhereas well founded approximations for carbon and oxygen [1, 2]. In this note, we\n40\nreport results on modeling of the SFs for heavier nuclei like 40\n20 Ca and 18 Ar.\nOur primary motivation was to provide a good description of medium-sized nuclei by\ntheir SFs and, as a result, to improve accuracy of the predicted neutrino-nucleus cross\nsections with respect to the Fermi gas (FG) model for neutrino energy around 1 GeV.\nWe focus on quasielastic (QE) scattering and therefore verify obtained SFs in the region\nof energy transfer up to the QE peak.\nModel description. Every SF is divided into two parts: the correlated and the mean\nfield (MF) one. Analytical formula for the correlated part of the SF is given in Ref. [3].\nThe MF part is modeled on the simplifying assumption that the level widths does not\ndepend on momentum. The obtained expression contains a contribution from each shellmodel state \u03b1 of energy E\u03b1 occupied by Nt\u03b1 nucleons:\n1\nPtMF (p, E) = ntMF (p) \u2211 Nt\u03b1 F\u03b1 (E\u03b1 \u2212 E) .\nNt \u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nIn the above, the MF part of the momentum distribution is denoted by ntMF and the\nnumber of nucleons of isospin t by Nt . As the function F\u03b1 , describing width of level \u03b1 ,\nwe use the Gaussian distribution. For further details, see [4].\nIn the numerical computations, we use the momentum distributions from Ref. [5]\nand recent parametrization of the electromagnetic form factors [6]. To evaluate the offshell hadronic current matrix elements, de Forest's prescription [7] is adopted. In the\nelectromagnetic case, a procedure to restore the current conservation is applied.\nTwo separate final state interactions (FSI) effects are included: Pauli blocking and\nreinteractions of the struck nucleon described by means of the optical potential [8].\n\n\fd\u03c3 \u0010 cm2 \u0011\nd\u03c9d\u03a9 GeVsr\n1030\n\n730 MeV, 37.1\u00b0\n\n1200 MeV, 32\u00b0\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n537 MeV, 37.1\u00b0\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0.3\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\n\u03c9 (GeV)\n\n0.3\n\nFIGURE 1.

The\nleft panel of Fig. 3 presents comparison with the few known experimental points for\n40 Ar(e, e\u2032 ) scattering [13]. Since the accuracy is comparable to the case of oxygen [4],\n18\nwe proceed to our final goal and apply the new SF to neutrino scattering.

The value of\n\u2212\nmomentum transfer at the peak is 371 MeV. Right panel: The process 40\n18 Ar(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc ).\n\nDiscussion. Only the QE scattering was considered. Thus for higher values of \u03c9 ,\nsome of the cross section is lacking. The oxygen nucleus provides the opportunity\nto compare our approximation with the more systematic Benhar SF, see Fig. 1. The\nsimplifying assumptions are responsible for slightly different shape of the QE peak\nobtained within our model, but the discrepancy is of the size of the error bars, and the\nachieved accuracy is good. Figure 2 shows that for heavier calcium target, the agreement\nwith data is better than for oxygen.\nWe conclude that the way we model SFs works fine in the region of \u03c9 and |q| relevant\nto \u223c 1 GeV neutrino QE scattering. By adopting the standard extrapolation, we expect\nthat the model tested for electrons describes neutrino scattering equally well. It allows us\nto presume that the accuracy of the neutrino cross section plot shown in the right panel\nof Fig. 3 is similar to those presented for electron scattering.\nIn the case of all three targets, larger deviations from the electron scattering data occur\nfor lower beam energies. This can be understood as an indication that when momentum\ntransfer at the QE peak is lower than \u223c400 MeV, the IA is no longer reliable.\nAcknowledgments.
