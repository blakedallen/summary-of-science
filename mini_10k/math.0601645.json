Introduction.\nIn the recent past, noncommutative analysis (in a wide sense) has developed rapidly because of its interesting and fruitful interactions with classical theories such as C \u2217 -algebras,\nBanach spaces, probability, or harmonic analysis. The theory of operator spaces has played a\nprominent role in these developments, leading to new fields of research in either operator theory, operator algebras or quantum probability. The recent theory of martingales inequalities\nin noncommutative Lp -spaces is a good example for this development. Indeed, square functions associated to martingales and most of the classical martingale inequalities have been\nsuccessfully transferred to the noncommutative setting. See in particular [66, 33, 70, 37], and\nalso the recent survey [81] and the references therein. The noncommutative maximal ergodic\ntheorem in [36] is our starting point for the study of noncommutative diffusion semigroups.\nOn this line we investigate noncommutative analogs of classical square function inequalities.\nIt is remarkable that operator space techniques have led to new results on classical analysis.\nWe mention in particular completely bounded Fourier multipliers and Schur multipliers on\nSchatten classes [31]. In our treatment of semigroups no prior knowledge on operator space\ntheory is required. However, operator space concepts underlie our understanding of the\nsubject.\nOur objectives are to introduce natural square functions associated with a sectorial operator or a semigroup on some noncommutative Lp -space, to investigate their connections\nwith H \u221e functional calculus, and to give various concrete examples and applications. H \u221e\nfunctional calculus was introduced by McIntosh [54], and then developed by him and his\ncoauthors in a series of remarkable papers [55, 21, 3]. Nowadays this is a classical and\npowerful subject which plays an important role in spectral theory for unbounded operators,\nabstract maximal Lp -regularity, or multiplier theory. See e.g. [44] for more information and\nreferences.\nSquare functions for generators of semigroups appeared earlier in Stein's classical book [72]\non the Littlewood-Paley theory for semigroups acting on usual (=commutative) Lp -spaces.\nStein gave several remarkable applications of these square functions to functional calculus\nand multiplier theorems for diffusion semigroups. Later on, Cowling [20] obtained several\nextensions of these results and used them to prove maximal theorems.\nThe fundamental paper [21] established tight connections between McIntosh's H \u221e functional calculus and Stein's approach. Assume that A is a sectorial operator on Lp (\u03a3), with\n1 < p < \u221e, and let F be a non zero bounded analytic function on a sector {|Arg(z)| < \u03b8}\ncontaining the spectrum of A, and such that F tends to 0 with an appropriate estimate as\n|z| \u2192 \u221e and as |z| \u2192 0 (see Section 3 for details). The associated square function is defined\nby\n\u0013 12\n\u0012Z \u221e\n2 dt\n,\nx \u2208 Lp (\u03a3).\nF (tA)x\nkxkF =\nt\n0\np\nFor example if \u2212A is the generator of a bounded analytic semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (\u03a3), then\nwe can apply the above with the function F (z) = ze\u2212z and in this case, we obtain the\n\n\f3\n\nfamiliar square function\nkxkF =\n\n\u0010Z\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nt\n\n\u0001 2 \u0011 12\n\u2202\nTt (x) dt\n\u2202t\n\np\n\nfrom [72, Chapters III-IV]. One of the most remarkable connections between H \u221e functional\ncalculus and square functions on Lp -spaces is as follows. If A admits a bounded H \u221e functional calculus, then we have an equivalence K1 kxk \u2264 kxkF \u2264 K2 kxk for any F as above.\nIndeed this follows from [21] (see also [50]).\nIn this paper we consider a sectorial operator A acting on a noncommutative Lp -space\nLp (M) associated with a semifinite von Neumann algebra (M, \u03c4 ). For an appropriate\nbounded analytic function F as before, we introduce two square functions which are approximately defined as\n\u00131\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001 dt 2\nkxkF,c =\nF (tA)x F (tA)x\nt\n0\np\nand\n\nkxkF,r =\n\n\u0012Z\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\u2217 dt\nF (tA)x F (tA)x\nt\n\n\u0013 12\n\np\n\n(see Section 6 for details). The functions k kF,c and k kF,r are called column and row square\nfunctions respectively. Using them we define a symmetric square function kxkF . As with the\nnoncommutative Khintchine inequalities (see [52, 53]), this definition depends upon whether\np \u2265 2 or p < 2. If p \u2265 2, we set kxkF = max{kxkF,c ; kxkF,r }. See Section 6 for the more\ncomplicated case p < 2. Then one of our main results is that if A admits a bounded H \u221e\nfunctional calculus on Lp (M), with 1 < p < \u221e, we have an equivalence\n(1.1)\n\nfor these square functions.\n\nK1 kxk \u2264 kxkF \u2264 K2 kxk\n\nAfter a short introduction to noncommutative Lp -spaces, Section 2 is devoted to preliminary results on noncommutative Hilbert space valued Lp -spaces, which are central for the\ndefinition of square functions. These spaces and related ideas first appeared in Pisier's memoir [62]. In fact operator valued matrices and operator space techniques (see e.g. [60, 62, 63])\nplay a natural role in our context. However we tried to make the paper accessible to readers\nnot familiar with operator space theory and completely bounded maps.\nIn Section 3 we give the necessary background on sectorial operators, semigroups, and H \u221e\nfunctional calculus. Then we introduce a completely bounded H \u221e functional calculus for an\noperator A acting on a noncommutative Lp (M). Again this is quite natural in our context\nand indeed it turns out to be important in our study of square functions (see in particular\nCorollary 7.9).\nRademacher boundedness and Rademacher sectoriality now play a prominent role in H \u221e\nfunctional calculus. We refer the reader e.g. to [42], [79], [80], [48], [50] or [44] for developments and applications. On noncommutative Lp -spaces, it is natural to introduce two\n\n\f4\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nrelated concepts, namely the column boundedness and the row boundedness. If F is a set\nof bounded operators on Lp (M), we will say that F is Col-bounded if we have an estimate\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\n\u0011 21\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2264 C\nxk xk\nTk (xk ) Tk (xk )\nk\n\nLp (M)\n\nk\n\nLp (M)\n\nfor any finite families T1 , . . . , Tn in F, and x1 , . . . , xn in Lp (M). Row boundedness is defined\nsimilarly. We develop these concepts in Section 4, along with the related notions of column\nand row sectoriality.\nSections 6 and 7 are devoted to square functions and their interplay with H \u221e functional\ncalculus. As a consequence of the main result of Section 4, we prove that if A is Col-sectorial\n(resp. Rad-sectorial), then we have an equivalence\nK1 kxkG,c \u2264 kxkF,c \u2264 K2 kxkG,c\n\n(resp. K1 kxkG \u2264 kxkF \u2264 K2 kxkG )\n\nfor any pair of non zero functions F, G defining square functions. This is a noncommutative\ngeneralization of the main result of [50]. Then we prove the aforementioned result that\n(1.1) holds true if A has a bounded H \u221e functional calculus. We also show that conversely,\nappropriate square function estimates for an operator A on Lp (M) imply that A has a\nbounded H \u221e functional calculus.\nSection 5 (which is independent of Sections 6 and 7) is devoted to a noncommutative\ngeneralization of Stein's diffusion semigroups considered in [72]. We define a noncommutative\ndiffusion semigroup to be a point w \u2217-continuous semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 of normal contractions\non (M, \u03c4 ), such that each Tt is selfadjoint with respect to \u03c4 . In this case, (Tt )t\u22650 extends\nto a c0 -semigroup of contractions on Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Let \u2212Ap denote the\nnegative generator of the Lp -realization of (Tt )t\u22650 . Our main result in this section is that if\nfurther each Tt : M \u2192 M is positive (resp. completely positive), then Ap is Rad-sectorial\n(resp. Col-sectorial and Row-sectorial). The proof is based on a noncommutative maximal\ntheorem from [35, 36], where such diffusion semigroups were considered for the first time.\nIf (Tt )t\u22650 is a noncommutative diffusion semigroup as above, the most interesting general\nquestion is whether Ap admits a bounded H \u221e functional calculus on Lp (M) for 1 < p < \u221e.\nThis question has an affirmative answer in the commutative case [20] but it is open in the\nnoncommutative setting. The last three sections are devoted to examples of natural diffusion\nsemigroups, for which we are able to show that Ap admits a bounded H \u221e functional calculus.\nHere is a brief description.\nIn Section 8, we consider left and right multiplication operators, Hamiltonians, and Schur\nmultipliers on Schatten space S p . Let H be a real Hilbert space, and let (\u03b1k )k\u22651 and (\u03b2k )k\u22651\nbe two sequences of H. We consider the semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 of Schur multipliers which are\ndetermined by Tt (Eij ) = e\u2212t(k\u03b1i \u2212\u03b2j k) Eij , where the Eij 's are the standard matrix units. This\nis a diffusion semigroup on B(l2 ) and we show that the associated negative generators Ap\nhave a bounded H \u221e functional calculus for any 1 < p < \u221e.\nLet H be a real Hilbert space. In Section 9, we consider the q-deformed von Neumann\nalgebras \u0393q (H) of Bozejko and Speicher [13, 14], equipped with its canonical trace. To any\n\n\f5\n\ncontraction a : H \u2192 H we may associate a second quantization operator \u0393q (a) : \u0393q (H) \u2192\n\u0393q (H), which is a normal unital completely positive map. We consider semigroups defined\nby Tt = \u0393q (at ), where (at )t\u22650 is a selfadjoint contraction semigroup on H. This includes the\nq-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup [9, 11]. These semigroups (Tt )t\u22650 are completely positive\nnoncommutative diffusion semigroups and we show that the associated Ap 's have a bounded\nH \u221e functional calculus for any 1 < p < \u221e.\nIn Section 10 we consider the noncommutative Poisson semigroup of a free group. Let\nG = Fn be the free group with n generators and let | * | be the usual length function on G.\nLet V N(G) be the group von Neumann algebra and let \u03bb(g) \u2208 V N(G) be the left translation operator for any g \u2208 G. For any t \u2265 0, Tt is defined by Tt (\u03bb(g)) = e\u2212t|g| \u03bb(g). This\nsemigroup was introduced by Haagerup [30]. Again this is a completely positive noncommutative diffusion semigroup and we prove that that the associated Ap 's have a bounded\nH \u221e functional calculus for any 1 < p < \u221e. The proof uses noncommutative martingales in\nthe sense of [66], and we establish new square function estimates of independent interest for\nthese martingales.\nSection 11 is a brief account on the non tracial case. We consider noncommutative Lp spaces Lp (M, \u03c6) associated with a (possibly non tracial) normal faithful state \u03c6 on M, and\nwe give several generalizations or variants of the results obtained so far in the semifinite\nsetting.\nWe end this introduction with a few notations. If X is a Banach space, the algebra of all\nbounded operators on X is denoted by B(X). Further we let IX denote the identity operator\non X.\nWe usually let (ek )k\u22651 denote the canonical basis of l2 , or any orthonormal family on\nHilbert space. Further we let Eij = ei \u2297 ej \u2208 B(l2 ) denote the standard matrix units.\nWe will use the symbol \" \u224d \" to indicate that two functions are equivalent up to positive\nconstants. For example, (1.1) will be abbreviated by kxkF \u224d kxk. Next we will write X \u2248 Y\nto indicate that two Banach spaces X and Y are isomorphic.\nWe refer the reader to e.g. [71] and [41] for the necessary background on C \u2217 -algebras and\nvon Neumann algebras. We will make use of UMD Banach spaces, for which we refer to [17].\nThe main results of the present work were announced in [34].

We let M+ denote the positive part of M. Let S + be the set of all x \u2208 M+ whose\nsupport projection have a finite trace. Then any x \u2208 S + has a finite trace. Let S \u2282 M be\nthe linear span of S + , then S is a w \u2217-dense \u2217-subalgebra of M.\nLet 0 < p < \u221e. For any x \u2208 S, the operator |x|p belongs to S + and we set\nkxkp = \u03c4 (|x|p )\n1\n\n\u0001 p1\n\n,\n\nx \u2208 S.\n\nHere |x| = (x\u2217 x) 2 denotes the modulus of x. It turns out that k kp is a norm on S if\np \u2265 1, and a p-norm if p < 1. By definition, the noncommutative Lp -space associated with\n(M, \u03c4 ) is the completion of (S, k kp ). It is denoted by Lp (M). For convenience, we also\nset L\u221e (M) = M equipped with its operator norm. Note that by definition, Lp (M) \u2229 M is\ndense in Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e.\nAssume that M \u2282 B(H) acts on some Hilbert space H. It will be fruitful to also have a\ndescription of the elements of Lp (M) as (possibly unbounded) operators on H. Let M\u2032 \u2282\nB(H) denote the commmutant of M. We say that a closed and densely defined operator\nx on H is affiliated with M if x commutes with any unitary of M\u2032 . Then we say that an\naffiliated operator x is measurable (with respect to the trace \u03c4 ) provided that there is a\npositive integer n \u2265 1 such that \u03c4 (1 \u2212 pn ) < \u221e, where pn = \u03c7[0,n] (|x|) is the projection\nassociated to the indicator function of [0, n] in the Borel functional calculus of |x|. It turns\nout that the set L0 (M) of all measurable operators is a \u2217-algebra (see e.g. [74] for a precise\ndefinition of the sum and product on L0 (M)). Indeed, this \u2217-algebra has a lot of remarkable\np\nstability properties. First for any x in L0 (M) and any 0 < p < \u221e, the operator |x|p = (x\u2217 x) 2\nbelongs to L0 (M). Second, let L0 (M)+ be the positive part of L0 (M), that is, the set of\nall selfadjoint positive operators in L0 (M). Then the trace \u03c4 extends to a positive tracial\nfunctional on L0 (M)+ , still denoted by \u03c4 , in such a way that for any 0 < p < \u221e, we have\n\b\nLp (M) = x \u2208 L0 (M) : \u03c4 (|x|p ) < \u221e ,\n1\n\nequipped with kxkp = (\u03c4 (|x|p )) p . Furthermore, \u03c4 uniquely extends to a bounded linear\nfunctional on L1 (M), still denoted by \u03c4 . Indeed we have |\u03c4 (x)| \u2264 \u03c4 (|x|) = kxk1 for any\nx \u2208 L1 (M).\nFor any 0 < p \u2264 \u221e and any x \u2208 Lp (M), the adjoint operator x\u2217 belongs to Lp (M) as\np\nwell, with kx\u2217 kp = kxkp . Clearly, we also have that x\u2217 x \u2208 L 2 (M) and |x| \u2208 Lp (M), with\nk |x| kp = kxkp . We let Lp (M)+ = L0 (M)+ \u2229 Lp (M) denote the positive part of Lp (M).\nThe space Lp (M) is spanned by Lp (M)+ .\n\n\f7\n\nWe recall the noncommutative H\u00f6lder inequality. If 0 < p, q, r \u2264 \u221e are such that 1p + 1q = 1r ,\nthen\n(2.1)\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M), y \u2208 Lq (M).\n\nkxykr \u2264 kxkp kykq ,\n\nConversely for any z \u2208 Lr (M), there exist x \u2208 Lp (M) and y \u2208 Lq (M) such that z = xy,\nand kzkr = kxkp kykq .\nFor any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, let p\u2032 = p/(p \u2212 1) be the conjugate number of p. Applying (2.1) with\n\u2032\nq = p\u2032 and r = 1, we may define a duality pairing between Lp (M) and Lp (M) by\n(2.2)\n\n\u2032\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M), y \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nhx, yi = \u03c4 (xy),\n\nThis induces an isometric isomorphism\n(2.3)\n\n\u2032\n\nLp (M)\u2217 = Lp (M),\n\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\n\n1\n1\n+ \u2032 = 1.\np p\n\nIn particular, we may identify L1 (M) with the (unique) predual M\u2217 of M.\nAnother remarkable property of noncommutative Lp -spaces which will play a crucial role is\nthat they form an interpolation scale. By means of the natural embeddings of L\u221e (M) = M\nand L1 (M) = M\u2217 into L0 (M), one may regard (L\u221e (M), L1 (M)) as a compatible couple of\nBanach spaces. Then we have\n(2.4)\n\n[L\u221e (M), L1 (M)] 1 = Lp (M),\np\n\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n\nwhere [ , ]\u03b8 stands for the interpolation space obtained by the complex interpolation method\n(see e.g. [6]).\nThe space L2 (M) is a Hilbert space, with inner product given by (x, y) 7\u2192 hx, y \u2217 i = \u03c4 (xy \u2217 ).\nWe will need to pay attention to the fact that the identity (2.3) provided by (2.2) for p = 2\ndiffers from the canonical (antilinear) identification of a Hilbert space with its dual space.\nThis leads to two different notions of adjoints and we will use different notations for them.\nLet T : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) be any bounded operator. On the one hand, we will denote by T \u2217\nthe adjoint of T provided by (2.3) and (2.2), so that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c4 T (x)y = \u03c4 xT \u2217 (y) ,\nx, y \u2208 L2 (M).\nOn the other hand, we will denote by T \u2020 the adjoint of T in the usual sense of Hilbertian\noperator theory. That is,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c4 T (x)y \u2217 = \u03c4 x(T \u2020 (y))\u2217 ,\nx, y \u2208 L2 (M).\nFor any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e and any T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M), let T \u25e6 : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) be defined by\n(2.5)\n\nT \u25e6 (x) = T (x\u2217 )\u2217 ,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nIf p = 2, we see from above that\n(2.6)\n\nT \u2020 = T \u2217\u25e6 .\n\nIn particular T : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) being selfadjoint means that T \u2217 = T \u25e6 .\nThe above notations will be used as well when T is an unbounded operator.\n\n\f8\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nWe finally mention for further use that for any 1 < p < \u221e, Lp (M) is a UMD Banach\nspace (see [8] or [67, Section 7]).\nThroughout the rest of this section, (M, \u03c4 ) will be an arbitrary semifinite von Neumann\nalgebra.\n2.B. Tensor products.\nLet H be a Hilbert space. If the von Neumann algebra B(H) is equipped with its usual\ntrace tr, the associated noncommutative Lp -spaces are the Schatten spaces S p (H) for any\n0 < p < \u221e. We will simply write S p for S p (l2 ). If n \u2265 1 is any integer, then B(l2n ) \u2243 Mn , the\nalgebra of n \u00d7 n matrices with complex entries, and we will write Snp for the corresponding\nmatrix space S p (l2n ).\nWe equip the von Neumann algebra M\u2297B(H) with the trace \u03c4 \u2297 tr. Then for any\n0 < p < \u221e, we let\n(2.7)\n\nS p [H; Lp (M)] = Lp (M\u2297B(H)).\n\nAgain in the case when H = l2 (resp. H = l2n ), we simply write S p [Lp (M)] (resp.\nSnp [Lp (M)] = Lp (Mn (M))) for these spaces. These definitions are a special case of Pisier's\nnotion of noncommutative vector valued Lp -spaces [62]. Further comments on these spaces\nand their connection with operator space theory will be given in the paragraph 2.D below.\nLemma 2.1. For any 0 < p < \u221e, S p (H) \u2297 Lp (M) is dense in S p [H; Lp (M)].\nProof. Let (pt )t be a nondecreasing net of finite rank projections on H converging to IH in\nthe w \u2217 -topology. Then 1 \u2297 pt converges to 1 \u2297 IH in the w \u2217 -topology of M\u2297B(H). As is\nwell-known, this implies that k(1 \u2297 pt )x(1 \u2297 pt ) \u2212 xkp \u2192 0 for any x \u2208 Lp (M\u2297B(H)). Each\nHt = pt (H) is finite dimensional, hence we have\n(1 \u2297 pt )x(1 \u2297 pt ) \u2208 Lp (M \u2297 B(Ht )) = Lp (M) \u2297 S p (Ht ) \u2282 Lp (M) \u2297 S p (H)\n\nfor any x \u2208 Lp (M). This shows the density of S p (H) \u2297 Lp (M).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe shall now define various H-valued noncommutative Lp -spaces. For any a, b \u2208 H, we\nlet a \u2297 b\u0304 \u2208 B(H) denote the rank one operator taking any \u03be \u2208 H to h\u03be, bia. We fix some\ne \u2208 H with kek = 1, and we let pe = e \u2297 \u0113 be the rank one projection onto Span{e}. Then\nfor any 0 < p \u2264 \u221e, we let\nLp (M; Hc ) = Lp (M\u2297B(H))(1 \u2297 pe ).\n\nWe will give momentarily further descriptions of that space showing that its definition is\nessentially independent of the choice of e. For any 0 < p \u2264 \u221e, let us regard\nLp (M) \u2282 Lp (M) \u2297 S p (H) \u2282 Lp (M\u2297B(H))\n\nas a subspace of Lp (M\u2297B(H)) by identifying any c \u2208 Lp (M) with c \u2297 pe . Clearly this is an\nisometric embedding. This identification is equivalent to writing that\nLp (M) = (1 \u2297 pe )Lp (M\u2297B(H))(1 \u2297 pe ).\n\n\f9\n\nFor any element u \u2208 Lp (M; Hc ) \u2282 Lp (M\u2297B(H)), the product u\u2217 u belongs to the subspace\np\np\n(1 \u2297 pe )L 2 (M\u2297B(H))(1 \u2297 pe ) of L 2 (M\u2297B(H)). Applying the above identifications for 2p ,\np\n1\nwe may therefore regard u\u2217 u as an element of L 2 (M). Hence (u\u2217 u) 2 \u2208 Lp (M), and we have\n(2.8)\n\n1\n\nkukLp (M;Hc ) = (u\u2217u) 2\n\nLp (M)\n\n,\n\nu \u2208 Lp (M; Hc ).\n\nLet u \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 H and let (xk )k and (ak )k be finite families in Lp (M) and H such that\nP\nP\nu = k xk \u2297 ak . Let \u0169 \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 S p (H) be defined by \u0169 = k xk \u2297 (ak \u2297 \u0113). Then the\nmapping u 7\u2192 \u0169 induces a linear embedding\nLp (M) \u2297 H \u2282 Lp (M; Hc ).\nMoreover the argument for Lemma 2.1 shows the following.\nLemma 2.2. For any 0 < p < \u221e, Lp (M) \u2297 H is dense in Lp (M; Hc ).\nWePshall now compute the norm on Lp (M) \u2297 H induced by Lp (M; Hc ). Let us consider\nu = k xk \u2297 ak as above. Then we have\nX\nX\n\u0169 =\nxk \u2297 ak \u2297 \u0113\nand\n\u0169\u2217 =\nx\u2217k \u2297 e \u2297 a \u0304k .\nk\n\nk\n\nHence\n\n\u0169\u2217 \u0169 =\n\nX\ni,j\n\nAccording to (2.8), this shows that\n(2.9)\n\nX\nk\n\nxk \u2297 ak\n\nLp (M;Hc )\n\nhaj , ai i x\u2217i xj \u2297 pe .\n\n=\n\n\u0010X\ni,j\n\nhaj , ai i x\u2217i xj\n\n\u0011 21\n\nLp (M)\n\n.\n\nIn the above definitions, the index 'c' stands for 'column'. Indeed, if (e1 , . . . , en ) is an\northonormal family of H and if x1 , . . . , xn belong to Lp (M), it follows from (2.9) that\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nx1 0 * * * 0\n\u0010X\n\u0011 21\nX\n.. \uf8fb\n= \uf8f0 ... ...\n(2.10)\nxk \u2297 ek\n=\nx\u2217k xk\n.\n.\nLp (M)\nLp (M;Hc )\nk\nk\nxn 0 * * * 0\nLp (Mn (M))\n\nNote that according to Lemma 2.2, we can now regard Lp (M; Hc ) as the completion of\nLp (M) \u2297 H for the tensor norm given by (2.9), if p is finite. See Remark 2.3 (2) for the case\np = \u221e.\nWe now turn to analogous definitions with columns replaced by rows. Let e \u2208 H with\nkek = 1 as above, and let p\u0113 = \u0113 \u2297 e \u2208 B(H). For any 0 < p \u2264 \u221e, we let\nLp (M; Hr ) = (1 \u2297 p\u0113 )Lp (M\u2297B(H)).\n\n\f10\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThenPany of the above results for Lp (M; Hc ) has a version for Lp (M; Hr ). In particular, let\nu = k xk \u2297 ak in Lp (M) \u2297 H, with xk \u2208 Lp (M) and ak \u2208 H. Then identifying u with the\nP\nelement k xk \u2297 \u0113 \u2297 ak in Lp (M\u2297B(H)) yields a linear embedding\nLp (M) \u2297 H \u2282 Lp (M; Hr ),\n\nand we have\nX\n\n(2.11)\n\nk\n\nxk \u2297 ak\n\n=\n\nLp (M;Hr )\n\n\u0010X\ni,j\n\nhai , aj i xi x\u2217j\n\n\u0011 21\n\nLp (M)\n\n.\n\nThus if (e1 , . . . , en ) is an orthonormal family of H and if x1 , . . . , xn belong to Lp (M), then\nwe have\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nx1 . . . xn\n\u0010X\n\u00111\nX\n\uf8ef 0 ... 0 \uf8fa\n\u2217 2\n.\n(2.12)\nxk \u2297 ek\n=\nxk xk\n= \uf8ef\n.. \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 ...\nLp (M;Hr )\nLp (M)\n. \uf8fb\nk\n\nk\n\n0\n\n***\n\n0\n\nLp (Mn (M))\n\nMoreover for any 0 < p < \u221e, Lp (M) \u2297 H is a dense subspace of Lp (M; Hr ).\nThroughout this work, we will have to deal both with column spaces Lp (M; Hc ) and row\nspaces Lp (M; Hr ). In most cases, they will play symmetric roles. Thus we will often state\nsome results for Lp (M; Hc ) only and then take for granted that they also have a row version,\nthat will be used without any further comment.\nRemark 2.3.\n(1) Applying (2.10) and (2.12), we see that\nX\nX\nxk \u2297 ek\n=\nxk \u2297 ek\nL2 (M;Hc )\n\nk\n\n2\n\nk\n\n2\n\nL2 (M;Hr )\n2\n\n=\n\n\u0010X\nk\n\nkxk k22\n\n\u0011 21\n\nfor any x1 , . . . , xn in L (M). Thus L (M; Hc ) and L (M; Hr ) both coincide with the Hilbertian tensor product of L2 (M) and H.\n(2) The space L\u221e (M; Hc ) \u2282 M\u2297B(H) is w \u2217 -closed, and arguing as in the proof of Lemma\n2.1, it is clear that M \u2297 H \u2282 L\u221e (M; Hc ) is w \u2217 -dense. Indeed if (ei )i\u2208I is a basis of H for\nsome set I, then L\u221e (M; Hc ) coincides with the well-known space of all families (xi )i\u2208I in\nM such that\nn \u0010X\no\n\u0011 21\n\u2217\n(xi )i\u2208I L\u221e (M;Hc ) = sup\n: J \u2282 I finite < \u221e.\nxi xi\nM\n\ni\u2208J\n\n(3) Let {Eij : i, j \u2265 1} be the standard matrix units on B(l2 ), and let (ek )k\u22651 be the\ncanonical basis of l2 . It follows either from the definition of Lp (M; l2c ), or from (2.10), that\nfor any finite family (xk )k in Lp (M), we have\nX\nX\nxk \u2297 ek\n=\nEk1 \u2297 xk\n.\nk\n\nLp (M;l2c )\n\nA similar result holds true for row norms.\n\nk\n\nS p [Lp (M)]\n\n\f11\n\nFor any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, the linear mapping\n\nQp : Lp (M\u2297B(H)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M\u2297B(H))\n\ntaking any x \u2208 Lp (M\u2297B(H)) to x(1 \u2297 pe ) is a contractive projection whose range is equal to\nLp (M; Hc ). Moreover these projections are compatible. Thus applying (2.4) for M\u2297B(H),\nwe obtain that\n[L\u221e (M; Hc ), L1 (M; Hc )] 1 = Lp (M; Hc ),\n\n(2.13)\n\np\n\nA similar result holds for row spaces.\nLikewise, applying (2.3) to M\u2297B(H), we obtain that\n\u2032\n\nLp (M; Hc )\u2217 = Lp (M; H r ),\n\n(2.14)\n\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\n\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\n\n1\n1\n+ \u2032 = 1,\np p\n\nfor the duality pairing defined by taking (x \u2297 a, y \u2297 b\u0304) to ha, bi\u03c4 (xy) for any x \u2208 Lp (M),\n\u2032\ny \u2208 Lp (M), and a, b \u2208 H. By (2.10) and (2.12), an essentially equivalent reformulation of\nthis duality result is that for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and for any x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 Lp (M), we have\n\u001aX\n\u001b\nn\nn\nn\n\u0011 21\n\u00111\n\u0010X\n\u0010X\n\u2217\n\u2217 2\np\u2032\nxk xk\nyk yk\n(2.15)\nhyk , xk i : yk \u2208 L (M),\n= sup\n\u22641\np\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\np\u2032\n\nWe need to introduce two more H-valued noncommutative Lp -spaces, namely the intersection and the sum of row and column spaces. These spaces naturally appear in the\nso-called noncommutative Khintchine inequalities (see below). Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. We will\nregard (Lp (M; Hc ), Lp (M; Hr )) as a compatible couple of Banach spaces, in the sense of\ninterpolation theory (see e.g. [6]). Indeed if we let W be the injective tensor product of\nLp (M) and H, say, Lemma 2.2 and its row counterpart yield natural one-one linear mappings Lp (M; Hc ) \u2192 W and Lp (M; Hr ) \u2192 W . According to this convention, we define the\nintersection\nLp (M; Hr\u2229c ) = Lp (M; Hc ) \u2229 Lp (M; Hr ),\n\n(2.16)\nequipped with the norm\n(2.17)\n\n\b\nkukLp (M;Hr\u2229c) = max kukLp (M;Hc ) , kukLp (M;Hr ) .\n\nThen we define the sum\n\nLp (M; Hr+c ) = Lp (M; Hc ) + Lp (M; Hr ),\n\n(2.18)\nequipped with the norm\n(2.19)\n\n\b\nkukLp (M;Hr+c ) = inf ku1 kLp (M;Hc ) + ku2 kLp (M;Hr ) : u = u1 + u2 .\n\nWe now introduce Rademacher averages.

Let H, K be two Hilbert spaces and let Lp (M) be a noncommutative Lp -space,\nfor some 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then for any bounded operator T : H \u2192 K, the mapping ILp \u2297 T\n(uniquely) extends to a bounded operator from Lp (M; Hc ) into Lp (M; Kc ), with\nILp \u2297 T : Lp (M; Hc ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; Kc ) = kT k.\nLikewise ILp \u2297T extends to bounded operators of norm kT k from Lp (M; Hr ) into Lp (M; Kr ),\nfrom Lp (M; Hr\u2229c ) into Lp (M; Kr\u2229c ), and from Lp (M; Hr+c) into Lp (M; Kr+c ).\nAll these extensions will be usually denoted by Tb.\n\n\f13\n\nProof. Let T : H \u2192 K be a bounded operator, and let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Let (e1 , . . . , en ) be a finite\northonormal family in H, and let x1 , . . . , xn be arbitrary elements in Lp (M). We consider\nP\nP\nu = k xk \u2297 ek and Tb(u) = k xk \u2297 T (ek ).

The n \u00d7 n matrix [hT (ej ), T (ei )i] is nonnegative and its norm is less than or equal\nto kT k2 .

Vector-valued functions.\nIn this paragraph, we give more preliminary results in the case when the Hilbert space H\nis a concrete (commutative) L2 -space. We let (\u03a9, \u03bc) denote an arbitrary \u03c3-finite measure\nspace, and we shall consider Banach space valued L2 -spaces L2 (\u03a9; X). For any Banach\nRspace X,2 this space consists of all (strongly) measurable functions u : \u03a9 \u2192 X such that\nku(t)kX d\u03bc(t) is finite. The norm on this space is given by\n\u03a9\n\u0010Z\n\u0011 12\n2\nkukL2(\u03a9;X) =\nku(t)kX d\u03bc(t) ,\nu \u2208 L2 (\u03a9; X).\n\u03a9\n\nThe main reference for these spaces is [23], to which we refer the reader for more information\nand background. We merely recall a few facts.\nFirst, the tensor product L2 (\u03a9) \u2297 X is dense in L2 (\u03a9; X).\nSecond, for any u \u2208 L2 (\u03a9; X), and for any v \u2208 L2 (\u03a9; X \u2217 ), the function t 7\u2192 hv(t), u(t)i is\nintegrable and we may define a duality pairing\nZ\n(2.26)\nhv, ui = hv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) .\n\u03a9\n\n\f14\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThis pairing induces an isometric inclusion\nL2 (\u03a9; X \u2217 ) \u0592\u2192 L2 (\u03a9; X)\u2217 .\n\n(2.27)\n\nIf further X is reflexive, then this isometric inclusion is onto, and we obtain an isometric\nisomorphism L2 (\u03a9; X)\u2217 = L2 (\u03a9; X \u2217 ) (see e.g. [23, IV;1]).\nThird, as a consequence of (2.4), we have\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n(2.28)\nL (\u03a9; L\u221e (M)), L2 (\u03a9, L1 (M)) 1 = L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)),\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\np\n\nwhenever (M, \u03c4 ) is a semifinite von Neumann algebra.\n\nProposition 2.5. Let (\u03a9, \u03bc) be a measure space.\n(1) For any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2, we have contractive inclusions\nLp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2282 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) ,\n\nLp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ) \u2282 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) ,\n\nand Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ) \u2282 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)).\n(2) For any 2 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, we have contractive inclusions\nL2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) \u2282 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c )\n\nand L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) \u2282 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ).\n\nFor p 6= \u221e, we also have a contractive inclusion\n\nL2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) \u2282 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ).\n\nProof. Given a measurable subset I \u2282 \u03a9, we let \u03c7I denote the indicator function of I. Let\nx1 , . . . , xn be in L1 (M). Then for any y1 , . . . , yn in M = L1 (M)\u2217 , we have\n\u0010X\n\u00111\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\nX\n\u2217 2\n\u2217\nyk yk\nhyk , xk i \u2264\nxk xk\nM\n\nk\n\nk\n\n\u2264\n\n\u0010X\nk\n\nkyk k2\u221e\n\n\u0011 21 \u0010X\nk\n\nk\n\nx\u2217k xk\n\n\u0011 12\n\nL1 (M)\n\n1\n\n.\n\nP\nTaking the supremum over all y1 , . . . , yn with k kyk k2\u221e \u2264 1 yields\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\n\u0011 21\n(2.29)\nkxk k21 \u2264\n.\nx\u2217k xk\nk\n\nk\n\n1\n\n1\n\nNow changing xk into \u03bc(Ik ) 2 xk for a sequence I1 , . . . , In of pairwise disjoint measurable\nsubsets of finite measure in \u03a9, and using (2.9), we derive that\nn\nn\nX\nX\nxk \u2297 \u03c7Ik\n.\nxk \u2297 \u03c7Ik\n\u2264\nk=1\n\nL2 (\u03a9;L1 (M))\n\nk=1\n\nL1 (M;L2 (\u03a9)c )\n\nBy density this shows that L1 (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2282 L2 (\u03a9; L1 (M)) contractively. On the other\nhand, we have an isometric isomorphism L2 (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) = L2 (\u03a9; L2 (M)) by Remark 2.3\n(1). Thus in the column case, the result for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2 follows by interpolation, using (2.13)\nand (2.28). The row case can be treated similarly and the Rademacher case follows from the\nprevious two cases. Once (1) is proved, (2) follows by duality.\n\u0003\n\n\f15\n\nRemark 2.6. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and let p\u2032 = p/(p \u2212 1) be its conjugate number. If we identify\nH = L2 (\u03a9) with its complex conjugate in the usual way, and if we set X = Lp (M), then the\nduality pairing given by (2.26) is consistent with the one in (2.14). Namely if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2, if\n\u2032\nu \u2208 Lp (M, L2 (\u03a9)c ) and if v \u2208 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)), then the action of v on u induced by (2.14) is\n\u2032\ngiven by (2.26). Indeed, this is clear when u \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9) and v \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9), and\nthe general case follows by a density argument. This property will be extended in Lemma\n2.8 below.\nDefinition 2.7. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\n(1) Let u : \u03a9 \u2192 Lp (M) be a measurable function. We say that u belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c )\n\u2032\nif hy, u(* )i belongs to L2 (\u03a9) for any y \u2208 Lp (M) and if there exists \u03b8 \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c )\nsuch that\nZ\n\n(2.30)\n\nhy \u2297 b, \u03b8i =\np\n\n\u03a9\n\nhy, u(t)i b(t) d\u03bc(t) ,\n\n\u2032\n\ny \u2208 Lp (M), b \u2208 L2 (\u03a9).\n\n2\n\n(2) Let \u03b8 \u2208 L (M; L (\u03a9)c ). We say that \u03b8 is representable by a measurable function is\nthere exists a measurable u : \u03a9 \u2192 Lp (M) such that hy, u(* )i belongs to L2 (\u03a9) for any\n\u2032\ny \u2208 Lp (M) and (2.30) holds true.\n\nIf (1) (resp. (2)) holds, then \u03b8 (resp. u) is necessarily unique. Therefore we will make no\nnotational difference between \u03b8 and u in this case.\nA similar terminology will be used for row spaces Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ) or Rademacher spaces\nLp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ).\nIt is clear from Remark 2.6 that any u \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2229 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) is representable\nby a measurable function. Hence if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2, any element of Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) is representable\nby a measurable function. However we will see in Appendix 12.B that this is no longer the\ncase if p > 2.\nLemma 2.8. let 1 < p, p\u2032 < \u221e be conjugate numbers and let u \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) and\n\u2032\nv \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ) be (representable by) measurable functions in the sense of Definition\n2.7. Then the function t 7\u2192 hv(t), u(t)i is integrable on \u03a9 and\nZ\n(2.31)\nhv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) \u2264 kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\n\u03a9\n\nMoreover the action of v on u given by (2.14) for H = L2 (\u03a9) is equal to\nZ\n(2.32)\nhv, ui = hv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) .\n\u03a9\n\nProof. We may assume that p > 2. We fix some measurable u in Lp (M, L2 (\u03a9)c ). By\n\u2032\nassumption, (2.30) holds true for any y \u2208 Lp (M) and any b \u2208 L2 (\u03a9). Hence t 7\u2192 hv(t), u(t)i\n\u2032\nis integrable and (2.32) holds true for any v in the tensor product Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9). Let\n\u2032\nc \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9) and let v in Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9). Then\nZ\nhv(t), u(t)i c(t) d\u03bc(t) = hcv, ui.\n\u03a9\n\n\f16\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nHence by the above observation, we have\nZ\nhv(t), u(t)i c(t) d\u03bc(t) \u2264 kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)c ) kcvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\n\u03a9\n\nApplying Lemma 2.4 to the multiplication operator L2 (\u03a9) \u2192 L2 (\u03a9) taking any b \u2208 L2 (\u03a9)\nto cb, we obtain that the right hand side of the above inequality is less than or equal to\nkck\u221e kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\nTaking the supremum over all c \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9) with norm less than 1, we obtain (2.31) for\n\u2032\nv \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9).\n\u2032\nNext we consider an arbitrary v \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ). By Proposition 2.5, we can find a\n\u2032\nsequence (vn )n\u22651 in Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9) such that\nkv \u2212 vn kL2 (\u03a9;Lp\u2032 (M)) \u2264 kv \u2212 vn kLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) \u2212\u2192 0.\nPassing to a subsequence, we may assume that vn \u2192 v a.e. Then hu, vn i \u2192 hu, vi a.e., and\nwe deduce (2.31) by Fatou's Lemma.\nFinally applying (2.31) with (v \u2212 vn ) instead of v, we deduce that since each vn satisfies\n(2.32), then v satisfies it as well.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.9. The previous lemma clearly has variants (with identical proofs) involving\n\u2032\nthe Rademacher spaces. Namely, if u \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ) and v \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ) are\nmeasurable functions, then the function t 7\u2192 hv(t), u(t)i is integrable on \u03a9, the identity\n(2.32) holds true, and\nZ\nhv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) \u2264 kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)rad ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)rad ) .\n\u03a9\n\nWe conclude our discussion on measurable functions with the following useful converse to\nLemma 2.8.\nLemma 2.10. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and let p\u2032 be its conjugate number. Let u : \u03a9 \u2192 Lp (M) be a\nmeasurable function. Then u \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) if and only if t 7\u2192 hy, u(t)i belongs to L2 (\u03a9)\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfor any y \u2208 Lp (M) and there is a constant K > 0 such that for any v \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9),\nwe have\nZ\n\u03a9\n\nhv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) \u2264 KkvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\n\nIn this case, the norm of u in Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) is equal to the smallest possible K.\n\nProof. The 'only if' part follows from Lemma 2.8. If p > 1, the 'if' part is a direct consequence\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof (2.14) and of the density of Lp (M)\u2297L2 (\u03a9) in Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ). Thus it suffices to consider\nthe case when p = 1. In this case, the result can be deduced from operator space arguments\nwhich will be outlined in the paragraph 2.D, and from [62, Lemma 1.12]. However we give\na self-contained proof for the convenience of the reader.\n\n\f17\n\nWe assume for simplicity that H = L2 (\u03a9) is infinite dimensional and separable (otherwise,\nreplace sequences by nets in the argument below). Let u : \u03a9 \u2192 L1 (M) be a measurable\nfunction, and assume that\nnZ\no\nK = sup\nhv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) : v \u2208 M \u2297 L2 (\u03a9), kvkL\u221e (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) \u2264 1 < \u221e.\n\u03a9\n\nBy Proposition 2.5 (2), the norm on M \u2297 L2R(\u03a9) induced by L2 (\u03a9; M) is greater than the\none induced by L\u221e (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ). Thus v 7\u2192 \u03a9 hv, ui extends to an element of L2 (\u03a9; M)\u2217 .\nSince u is measurable and valued in L1 (M), we deduce from (2.27) that u \u2208 L2 (\u03a9, L1 (M)).\nLet (ek )k\u22651 be a basis of H = L2 (\u03a9). Since u \u2208 L2 (\u03a9, L1 (M)), we can define xk \u2208 L1 (M)\nby\nZ\nxk =\n\nek (t)u(t) d\u03bc(t) ,\n\n\u03a9\n\nFor any n \u2265 1, we consider\n\nun =\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n1\n\nk \u2265 1.\n\nxk \u2297 ek \u2208 L1 (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9).\n\nFor convenience we let Z = L (M, L2 (\u03a9)c ) in the rest of the proof. Our objective is now\nto show that (un )n\u22651 is a Cauchy sequence in Z. For any m \u2265 1, let Pm : H \u2192 H be the\northogonal projection onto Span{e1 , . . . , em }. If m \u2264 n, then we have (IL1 \u2297 Pm )(un ) = um .\nHence kum kZ \u2264 kun kZ by Lemma 2.4.

For instance, a measurable function u : \u03a9 \u2192 Lp (M) belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r+c )\nwith kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)r+c ) \u2264 K if and only if\nZ\nhv(t), u(t)i d\u03bc(t) \u2264 KkvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r\u2229c )\n\u03a9\n\np\u2032\n\n2\n\nfor any v \u2208 L (M) \u2297 L (\u03a9).\nWe also observe that if V \u2282 L2 (\u03a9) is a dense subspace, then the same result holds true\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9) replaced by Lp (M) \u2297 V.\nWe will now interpret the above results in the case when H = L2 (\u03a9) = l2 , and regard\nLp (M, l2c ), Lp (M, l2r ), and Lp (M, l2rad ) as sequence spaces. Let (ek )k\u22651 denote the canonical\nbasis of l2 . For any k \u2265 1, let \u03c6k = h* , ek i be the functional on l2 associated with ek , and\nlet \u03c6\nck : Lp (M; l2c ) \u2192 Lp (M) denote the continuous extension of ILp \u2297 \u03c6k . We say that a\nsequence (xk )k\u22651 of Lp (M) belongs to Lp (M, l2c ) if there exists some (necessarily unique)\nu in Lp (M, l2c ) such that xk = \u03c6\nck (u) for any k \u2265 1. We adopt a similar convention for\nLp (M, l2r ) and Lp (M, l2rad ).\nCorollary 2.12. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and let (xk )k\u22651 be a sequence of Lp (M). Then (xk )k\u22651\nbelongs to Lp (M, l2c ) if and only if there is a constant K > 0 such that\nn\nX\nk=1\n\nxk \u2297 ek\n\nLp (M;l2c )\n\n\u2264 K,\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\nIn this case the norm of (xk )k\u22651 in Lp (M, l2c ) is equal to the smallest possible K.\nMoreover the same result holds with l2c replaced by either l2r or l2rad .\nProof. This clearly follows from Lemma 2.10 and Remark 2.11.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe end this paragraph with a few observations to be used later on concerning Rademacher\nnorms and vector-valued L2 -spaces.\nLet Rad \u2282 L1 (\u03a3) be the closed subspace spanned by the \u03b5k 's. For any x1 , . . . , xn in\nP\nsome Banach space X, the norm\nk \u03b5k xk Rad(X) defined by (2.20) is the norm of the sum\nP\n1\n1\n1\nk \u03b5k \u2297 xk in the vector valued L -space L (\u03a3; X). Accordingly, we let Rad(X) \u2282 L (\u03a3; X)\nbe the closure of Rad \u2297 X in L1 (\u03a3; X). Likewise, we let Rad2 \u2282 L2 (\u03a3) be the closed linear\nspan of the \u03b5k 's in L2 (\u03a3), and we let Rad2 (X) \u2282 L2 (\u03a3; X) be the closure of Rad2 \u2297 X. By\nKahane's inequality (see e.g. [51, Theorem 1.e.13]), the spaces Rad(X) and Rad2 (X) are\nisomorphic.\n\n\f19\n\nWe let P : L2 (\u03a3) \u2192 L2 (\u03a3) denote the orthogonal projection onto Rad2 . Let (E0 , E1 )\nbe an interpolation couple of Banach spaces, and assume that E0 and E1 are both Kconvex. Following [64, p. 43] or [65], this means that for i \u2208 {0, 1}, the tensor extension\nP \u2297 IEi : L2 \u2297 Ei \u2192 L2 \u2297 Ei extends to a bounded projection on L2 (\u03a3; Ei ), whose range is\nequal to Rad2 (Ei ). For any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), let E\u03b1 = [E0 , E1 ]\u03b1 . Then\nL2 (\u03a3; E\u03b1 ) = [L2 (\u03a3; E0 ), L2 (\u03a3; E1 )]\u03b1 .\n\nOwing to the projections onto Rad2 (E0 ) and Rad2 (E1 ) given by the K-convexity, this implies\nthat Rad2 (E\u03b1 ) is isomorphic to the interpolation space [Rad2 (E0 ) , Rad2 (E1 )]\u03b1 . Applying\nKahane's inequality, we finally obtain the isomorphism\n\u0002\n\u0003\nRad(E\u03b1 ) \u2248 Rad(E0 ) , Rad(E1 ) \u03b1 .\n\nNow note that for any 1 < p < \u221e, the Banach space Lp (M) is K-convex. Indeed, this\nfollows from [25] and [65]. (More generally, any UMD Banach space is K-convex.) Thus we\ndeduce from above and from (2.4) that if 1 < r < q < \u221e, we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\n=\n+ .\n(2.33)\nRad(Lp (M)) \u2248 Rad(Lq (M)) , Rad(Lr (M)) \u03b1\nif\np\nq\nr\nNote also that by our definitions in paragraph 2.B, we have\n(2.34)\n\nRad(Lp (M)) \u2248 Lp (M; l2rad ),\n\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\n\n2.D. Completely positive maps and completely bounded maps.\nLet 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. We say that a linear map T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is positive if it maps the\npositive cone Lp (M)+ into itself. Then for an integer n \u2265 2, we say that T is n-positive if\nISnp \u2297 T : Snp [Lp (M)] \u2212\u2192 Snp [Lp (M)]\n\nis positive. Recall here that Snp [Lp (M)] = Lp (Mn (M)) is a noncommutative Lp -space.\nFinally we say that T is completely positive if it is n-positive for all n. We refer the reader\ne.g. to [60] for a large information on completely positive maps on C \u2217 -algebras.\nLikewise, we say that T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is completely bounded if\nkT kcb = sup ISnp \u2297 T : Snp [Lp (M)] \u2212\u2192 Snp [Lp (M)]\nn\n\nis finite. In this case kT kcb is called the completely bounded norm of T . If p is finite, it\nis easy to see that T is completely bounded if and only if IS p \u2297 T extends to a bounded\noperator from S p [Lp (M)] into itself. In that case, the extension is unique and\n(2.35)\n\nkT kcb = IS p \u2297 T : S p [Lp (M)] \u2212\u2192 S p [Lp (M)] .\n\nMore generally if T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is completely bounded and H is any Hilbert space,\nthen IS p (H) \u2297 T extends to a bounded operator from S p [H; Lp (M)] into itself, whose norm\nis less than or equal to kT kcb. Consequently, T \u2297 IH both extends to bounded operators on\nLp (M; Hc ) and on Lp (M; Hr ), with\n(2.36)\n\nT \u2297 IH : Lp (M; Hc ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; Hc )\n\n\u2264 kT kcb\n\n\f20\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nand\n(2.37)\n\nT \u2297 IH : Lp (M; Hr ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; Hr ) \u2264 kT kcb.\n\nIf kT kcb \u2264 1, we say that T is completely contractive. Next we say that the operator\nT : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is a complete isometry if ISnp \u2297 T is an isometry for any n \u2265 1. In this\ncase, IS p \u2297 T : S p [Lp (M)] \u2192 S p [Lp (M)] also is an isometry.\nAssume that 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and let p\u2032 be its conjugate number. Applying (2.3) with\n\u2032\n\u2032\nMn (M), we have an isometric identification Snp [Lp (M)]\u2217 = Snp [Lp (M)]. It clearly follows\nfrom this identity that T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is completely bounded if and only its adjoint\n\u2032\n\u2032\nT \u2217 : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is completely bounded, with\n(2.38)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nkT : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)kcb = kT \u2217 : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)kcb.\n\nAlthough we will not use it explicitly, we briefly mention that several notions considered\nso far have a natural description in the framework of operator space theory.\nWe need complex interpolation of operator spaces, for which we refer to [63, Section 2.7].\nLet E1 be L1 (M) equipped with the predual operator space structure of Mop . Then for\nany 1 < p < \u221e, equip Lp (M) with the operator space structure obtained by interpolating\nbetween M = E\u221e and E1 (see [63, p.139]). Let Ep be this operator space, so that Ep =\n[E\u221e , E1 ] 1 completely isometrically. Then for any Hilbert space H, and any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, the\np\ndefinition (2.7) coincides with Pisier's operator space valued Schatten space S p [H; Ep ] (see\n[62, pp. 24-25]). Thus according to [62, Lemma 1.7], a linear map T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is\ncompletely bounded in the sense of (2.35) if and only if it is completely bounded from Ep\ninto itself in the usual sense of operator space theory.\nLet H be a Hilbert space, and let Hc (resp. Hr ) be the space H equipped with its column\n(resp. row) operator space structure (see e.g. [63, p.22]). Then for any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1], let\nHc (\u03b8) = [Hc , Hr ]\u03b8 in the sense of the interpolation of operator spaces. Then\nLp (M; Hc ) = Hc ( p1 ) \u2297h Ep ,\n\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\n\nwhere \u2297h denotes the Haagerup tensor product (see e.g. [63, Chapter 5]). Indeed, this\nidentity follows from [62, Theorem 1.1]. Likewise, we have\nLp (M; Hr ) = Ep \u2297h Hr ( 1p ),\n\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\n\nwhere we have defined Hr (\u03b8) = [Hr , Hc ]\u03b8 for any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1].\nRemark 2.13. Let M be a commutative von Neumann algebra, and let \u03a3 be a measure\nspace such that M \u2243 L\u221e (\u03a3) as von Neumann algebras (see e.g. [71, 1.18]). Then Lp (M)\ncoincides with the usual commutative space Lp (\u03a3), and S p [H; Lp (\u03a3)] = Lp (\u03a3; S p (H)) for\nany H and any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Thus a completely bounded map T : Lp (\u03a3) \u2192 Lp (\u03a3) on some\ncommutative Lp -space is a bounded mapping whose tensor extension T \u2297 IS p extends to a\nbounded operator on the vector valued Lp -space Lp (\u03a3; S p ).\n\n\f21\n\nLikewise, for any Hilbert space H and any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, we have\n\nLp (M; Hc ) = Lp (M; Hr ) = Lp (M; Hrad ) = Lp (\u03a3; H)\n\nisometrically.\n\n\f22\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n3. Bounded and completely bounded H \u221e functional calculus.\n3.A. H \u221e functional calculus.\nIn this paragraph, we give a brief review of H \u221e functional calculus on general Banach\nspaces, and preliminary results. We mainly follow the fundamental papers [54] and [21]. See\nalso [3] or [47] for further details. We refer the reader e.g. to [29] or to [22] for the necessary\nbackground on semigroup theory.\nLet X be a Banach space, and let A be a (possibly unbounded) linear operator A on X.\nWe let D(A), N(A) and R(A) denote the domain, kernel and range of A respectively. Next\nwe denote by \u03c3(A) and \u03c1(A) the spectrum and the resolvent set of A respectively. Then for\nany z \u2208 \u03c1(A), we let R(z, A) = (z \u2212 A)\u22121 denote the corresponding resolvent operator.\nFor any \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), we let\n\n\b\n\u03a3\u03c9 = z \u2208 C\u2217 : |Arg(z)| < \u03c9\n\nbe the open sector of angle 2\u03c9 around the half-line (0, +\u221e). By definition, A is a sectorial\noperator of type \u03c9 if A is closed and densely defined, \u03c3(A) \u2282 \u03a3\u03c9 , and for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0)\nthere is a constant K\u03b8 > 0 such that\n(3.1)\n\nkzR(z, A)k \u2264 K\u03b8 ,\n\nz \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\nWe say that A is sectorial of type 0 if it is of type \u03c9 for any \u03c9 > 0.\nLet (Tt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on X and let \u2212A denote its infinitesimal generator.\nThen A is closed and densely defined. Moreover \u03c3(A) \u2282 \u03a3 \u03c02 and for any z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3 \u03c02 , we\nhave\nZ \u221e\n(3.2)\nR(z, A) = \u2212\netz Tt dt\n0\n\nin the strong operator topology (this is the Laplace formula). It is easy to deduce that A is\na sectorial operator of type \u03c02 .\nThe following lemma is well-known. A semigroup (Tt )t>0 which satisfies (i) and/or (ii)\nbelow for some \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ) is called a bounded analytic semigroup, see e.g. [29, I.5].\nLemma 3.1. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on X with infinitesimal generator \u2212A,\nand let \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ). The following are equivalent.\n\n(i) A is sectorial of type \u03c9.\n(ii) For any 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c9, (Tt )t>0 admits a bounded analytic extension (Tz )z\u2208\u03a3\u03b1 in\nB(X).\n\nFor any \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), let H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) be the space of all bounded analytic functions f : \u03a3\u03b8 \u2192 C.\nThis is a Banach algebra for the norm\n\b\nkf k\u221e,\u03b8 = sup |f (z)| : z \u2208 \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\n\f23\n\nThen we let H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) be the subalgebra of all f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) for which there exist two positive\nnumbers s, c > 0 such that\n(3.3)\n\n|f (z)| \u2264 c\n\n|z|s\n,\n(1 + |z|)2s\n\nz \u2208 \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\nLet A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on X. Let \u03c9 < \u03b3 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, and let \u0393\u03b3 be\nthe oriented contour defined by :\n\u001a\n\u2212tei\u03b3 , t \u2208 R\u2212 ;\n(3.4)\n\u0393\u03b3 (t) =\nte\u2212i\u03b3 , t \u2208 R+ .\n\nIn other words, \u0393\u03b3 is the boundary of \u03a3\u03b3 oriented counterclockwise. For any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ),\nwe set\nZ\n1\nf (z)R(z, A) dz .\n(3.5)\nf (A) =\n2\u03c0i \u0393\u03b3\nIt follows from (3.1) and (3.3) that this integral is absolutely convergent. Indeed (3.3) implies\nthat for any 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b8, we have\nZ\ndz\n|f (z)|\n(3.6)\n< \u221e.\nz\n\u0393\u03b3\n\nThus f (A) is a well defined element of B(X). Using Cauchy's Theorem, it is not hard\nto check that its definition does not depend on the choice of \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03b8). Furthermore, the\nmapping f 7\u2192 f (A) is an algebra homomorphism from H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) into B(X) which is consistent\nwith the functional calculus of rational functions. We say that A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus if the latter homomorphism is continuous, that is, there is a constant\nK \u2265 0 such that\n(3.7)\n\nkf (A)k \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\nSectorial operators and H \u221e functional calculus behave nicely with respect to duality.\nAssume that X is reflexive and that A is a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on X. Then A\u2217 is a\nsectorial operator of type \u03c9 on X \u2217 as well. Next for any \u03b8 > \u03c9 and any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), let us\ndefine\n(3.8)\n\nfe(z) = f (z),\n\nz \u2208 \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\nThen fe belongs to H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), and kfek\u221e,\u03b8 = kf k\u221e,\u03b8 . Moreover,\n(3.9)\n\nfe(A\u2217 ) = f (A)\u2217\n\nif f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). Consequently, A\u2217 admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if A does.\n\nWe now turn to special features of sectorial operators with dense range. For any integer\nn \u2265 1, let gn be the rational function defined by\n(3.10)\n\ngn (z) =\n\nn2 z\n.\n(n + z)(1 + nz)\n\n\f24\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIf A is a sectorial operator on X, the sequences n(n + A)\u22121 n and nA(1 + nA)\u22121 n are\nbounded. Further it is not hard to check that n(n + A)\u22121 x \u2192 x for any x \u2208 X and that\nnA(1 + nA)\u22121 x \u2192 x for any x \u2208 R(A) (see e.g. [21, Theorem 3.8]). This yields the following.\nLemma 3.2. Let A be a sectorial operator on X, and assume that A has dense range. Let\n(gn )n\u22651 be defined by (3.10). Then\nsup kgn (A)k < \u221e\n\nand\n\nn\n\nlim gn (A)x = x for any x \u2208 X.\nn\n\nConsequently, A is one-one.\nLet A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and assume that A has dense range. Our\nnext goal is to define an operator f (A) for any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), whenever \u03b8 > \u03c9. For any n \u2265 1,\nthe operator gn (A) is one-one and we have\nR(gn (A)) = D(A) \u2229 R(A).\n\nThe latter space is therefore dense in X. We let g = g1 , that is\nz\n.\n(3.11)\ng(z) =\n(1 + z)2\nThen for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0) and any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), the product function f g belongs to H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nhence we may define (f g)(A) \u2208 B(X) by means of (3.5). Then using the injectivity of g(A),\nwe set\nf (A) = g(A)\u22121 (f g)(A),\nwith domain given by\n\b\nD(f (A)) = x \u2208 X : [(f g)(A)](x) \u2208 D(A) \u2229 R(A) .\n\nIt turns out that f (A) is a closed operator and that D(A) \u2229 R(A) \u2282 D(f (A)), so that\nf (A) is densely defined. Moreover this definition is consistent with (3.5) in the case when\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). Note however that f (A) may be unbounded in general.\nTheorem 3.3. ([54], [21]) Let 0 < \u03c9 < \u03b8 < \u03c0 and let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on\nX with dense range. Then f (A) is bounded for any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) if and only if A admits a\nbounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus. In that case, we have\nkf (A)k \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nwhere K is the constant from (3.7).\n\nf \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ),\n\nWe also recall that the above construction comprises imaginary powers of sectorial operators. Namely for any s \u2208 R, let fs be the analytic function on C \\ R\u2212 defined by fs (z) = z is .\nThen fs belongs to H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) for any \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), with\n(3.12)\n\nkfs k\u221e,\u03b8 = e\u03b8|s| .\n\nThe imaginary powers of a sectorial operator A with dense range may be defined by letting\nAis = fs (A) for any s \u2208 R. In particular, A admits bounded imaginay powers if it has a\nbounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for some \u03b8 (see [21, Section 5]).\n\n\f25\n\nRemark 3.4. It follows e.g. from [21, Theorem 3.8] that if A is a sectorial operator on a\nreflexive Banach space X, then X has a direct sum decomposition\nX = N(A) \u2295 R(A).\n\nHence A has dense range if and only if it is one-one. Moreover the restriction of A to R(A)\nis a sectorial operator which obviously has dense range. Thus changing X into R(A), or\nchanging A into the sum A + P where P is the projection onto N(A) with kernel equal to\nR(A), it is fairly easy in concrete situations to reduce to the case when a sectorial operator\nhas dense range.\nAnother way to reduce to operators with dense range is to replace an operator A by A + \u03b5\nfor \u03b5 > 0 and then let \u03b5 tend to 0. Indeed, let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on X and\nobserve that for any \u03b5 > 0, A + \u03b5 is an invertible sectorial operator of type \u03c9. In fact it is\neasy to deduce from the identity\nh z i\u0002\n\u0003\nzR(z, A + \u03b5) =\n(z \u2212 \u03b5)R(z \u2212 \u03b5, A)\nz\u2212\u03b5\nthat the operators A + \u03b5 are uniformly sectorial of type \u03c9, that is, for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0) there\nis a constant K\u03b8 > 0 not depending on \u03b5 > 0 such that\n(3.13)\n\nzR(z, A + \u03b5) \u2264 K\u03b8 ,\n\nz \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 , \u03b5 > 0.\n\nThe following well-known approximation lemma will be used later on. We include a proof\nfor the convenience of the reader.\nLemma 3.5. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on a Banach space X and let \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0)\nbe an angle. Then A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if and only if the operators\nA + \u03b5 uniformly admit a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus, that is, there is a constant K\nsuch that kf (A + \u03b5)k \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 for any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any \u03b5 > 0.\n\nProof. To prove the 'only if' part, assume that A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus and let U\u03b8 : H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) \u2192 B(X) be the resulting bounded homomorphism. Let \u03b5 > 0\nand let f be an arbitrary element of H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). We define a function h on \u03a3\u03b8 by letting\nf (\u03b5)\nh(z) = f (z + \u03b5) \u2212\n,\nz \u2208 \u03a3\u03b8 .\n1+z\nIt is easy to check that h belongs to H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), and that h(A) = f (A + \u03b5) \u2212 f (\u03b5)(1 + A)\u22121 .\nMoreover\nkhk\u221e,\u03b8 \u2264 C\u03b8 kf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\nfor some constant C\u03b8 only depending on \u03b8. Then we have\nkf (A + \u03b5)k \u2264 kh(A)k + |f (\u03b5)| (1 + A)\u22121\n\n\u2264 kU\u03b8 kkhk\u221e,\u03b8 + kf k\u221e,\u03b8 (1 + A)\u22121\n\u0001\n\u2264 ku\u03b8 kC\u03b8 + k(1 + A)\u22121 k kf k\u221e,\u03b8 .\n\nThis shows the desired uniform estimate.\n\n\f26\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nTo prove the 'if' part, first observe that for any z \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u03c9 , R(z, A + \u03b5) converges to R(z, A)\nwhen \u03b5 \u2192 0. Thus given any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), we have\nlim kf (A + \u03b5) \u2212 f (A)k = 0\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nby (3.5), (3.13), and Lebesgue's Theorem. This concludes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.B. Completely bounded H \u221e functional calculus.\nWe will introduce 'completely bounded versions' of sectoriality and H \u221e functional calculus\nfor operators acting on noncommutative Lp -spaces. Let (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann\nalgebra, let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and let X = Lp (M). We will use the space\nY = S p [Lp (M)]\n\nintroduced in paragraph 2.B, and we recall from Lemma 2.1 that S p \u2297 X is a dense subspace\nof Y . Throughout we will use the following two simple facts. First, for any \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 , \u03be \u2297 IX\n(uniquely) extends to a bounded operator\n\u03be\u2297IX : S p [Lp (M)] \u2212\u2192 Lp (M).\n\nSecond, if y \u2208 S p [Lp (M)] is such that (\u03be\u2297IX )y = 0 for any \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 , then y = 0.\nWe simply write I for the identity operator on S p . Let A be a closed and densely defined\noperator on X = Lp (M). We claim that the operator\nI \u2297 A : S p \u2297 D(A) \u2212\u2192 S p [Lp (M)]\n\nis closable. Indeed let (yn )n\u22650 be a sequence of S p \u2297 D(A) converging to 0 and assume that\n(I \u2297 A)yn converges to some y \u2208 Y . Then for any \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 , (\u03be \u2297 IX )yn belongs to D(A)\nand we have\nA(\u03be \u2297 IX )yn = (\u03be \u2297 IX )(I \u2297 A)yn \u2212\u2192 (\u03be\u2297IX )y.\nOn the other hand, we have (\u03be \u2297IX )yn \u2192 0. Since A is closed, this implies that (\u03be\u2297IX )y = 0.\nSince \u03be was arbitrary, we deduce that y = 0. This proves the claim.\nThe closure of I \u2297 A on S p [Lp (M)] will be denoted by\nI\u2297A.\n\nNote that if A = T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is a bounded operator, then I\u2297T is bounded if and\nonly if T is completely bounded, with kT kcb = kI\u2297T k (see paragraph 2.D).\nLemma 3.6. Let A be a closed and densely defined operator on X, and let A = I\u2297A on Y .\n(1) For any \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 and any y \u2208 D(A), (\u03be\u2297IX )y belongs to D(A) and\n\n(3.14)\n\nA(\u03be\u2297IX )y = (\u03be\u2297IX )Ay.\n\n(2) We have\n\u03c1(A) =\n\n\b\nz \u2208 \u03c1(A) : R(z, A) is completely bounded .\n\nMoreover, R(z, A) = I\u2297R(z, A) for any z \u2208 \u03c1(A).\n\n\f27\n\nProof. Part (1) is proved by repeating the argument showing that I \u2297 A is closable.\n\nTo prove (2), let z \u2208 \u03c1(A) and let \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 . By part (1), (z\u2212A)(\u03be\u2297IX ) and (\u03be\u2297IX )(z\u2212A)\ncoincide on D(A), hence\n\u03be\u2297IX = (z \u2212 A)(\u03be\u2297IX )R(z, A).\n\nWe deduce that for any e \u2208 S p and any x \u2208 X, we have\n(3.15)\n\nh\u03be, eix = (z \u2212 A)(\u03be\u2297IX )R(z, A)(e \u2297 x).\n\nConsider a pair (e, \u03be) verifying h\u03be, ei = 1, and define Rz : X \u2192 X by\nRz (x) = (\u03be\u2297IX )R(z, A)(e \u2297 x),\n\nx \u2208 X.\n\nIt follows from above that Rz is valued in D(A) and that (z \u2212 A)Rz = IX . Further it is clear\nthat Rz (z \u2212 A) = ID(A) . This shows that z \u2208 \u03c1(A), with R(z, A) = Rz . Now (3.15) can be\nrewritten as\nh\u03be, eiR(z, A)x = (\u03be\u2297IX )R(z, A)(e \u2297 x),\n\ne \u2208 S p , \u03be \u2208 (S p )\u2217 , x \u2208 X.\n\nThis shows that e \u2297 R(z, A)x = R(z, A)(e \u2297 x) for any e \u2208 S p and any x \u2208 X. Hence R(z, A)\nis completely bounded and I\u2297R(z, A) = R(z, A).\n\nConversely, let z \u2208 \u03c1(A) such that R(z, A) : X \u2192 X is completely bounded, and consider\nRz = I\u2297R(z, A) : Y \u2192 Y . Let y \u2208 D(A). By definition of this domain, there is a sequence\n(yn )n\u22651 in S p \u2297D(A) such that yn \u2192 y and (I \u2297A)yn \u2192 Ay. It is clear that Rz (z\u2212A)yn = yn\nfor any n \u2265 1 and passing to the limit we deduce that Rz (z \u2212 A)y = y.\nOn the other hand, let y \u2208 Y and let u = Rz y. Let (yn )n\u22651 be a sequence in S p \u2297 X\nconverging to y, and let un = (I \u2297 R(z, A))yn for any n \u2265 1. Then un belongs to S p \u2297 D(A)\nand un \u2192 u. Moreover\n(I \u2297 A)un = (I \u2297 AR(z, A))yn \u2212\u2192 (I\u2297AR(z, A))y.\n\nHence u = Rz y \u2208 D(A), with ARz y = (I\u2297AR(z, A))y. This shows that Rz is valued in\nD(A) and that (z \u2212 A)Rz y = y for any y \u2208 Y . These results show that z \u2208 \u03c1(A).\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.7. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on X = Lp (M).\n\n(1) We say that A is cb-sectorial of type \u03c9 if I\u2297A is sectorial of type \u03c9 on S p [Lp (M)].\n(2) Assume that (1) is fulfilled, and let \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0) be an angle. We say that A admits\na completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if I\u2297A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus.\n\nProposition 3.8. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on X = Lp (M).\n\n(1) A is cb-sectorial of type \u03c9 if and only if R(z, A) is completely bounded for any z \u2208\nC \\ \u03a3\u03c9 and for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0) there is a constant K\u03b8 > 0 such that\nkzR(z, A)kcb \u2264 K\u03b8 ,\n\nz \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\n\f28\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n(2) Assume that A is cb-sectorial of type \u03c9, and let \u03b8 > \u03c9. For any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ),\nthe operator f (A) is completely bounded and I\u2297f (A) = f (I\u2297A). Further A admits\na completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if and only if there is a constant\nK \u2265 0 such that\nkf (A)kcb \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\n(3) Assume that A has dense range and is cb-sectorial of type \u03c9. Then I\u2297A has dense\nrange and for any \u03b8 > \u03c9, we have\nI\u2297f (A) = f (I\u2297A),\n\nf \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\nProof. Parts (1) and (2) are straightforward consequences of Lemma 3.6 and (3.5).\nAssume that A has dense range and is cb-sectorial of type \u03c9, and let A = I\u2297A. Its range\ncontains S p \u2297 R(A), hence it is a dense subspace of Y . Let f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) for some \u03b8 > \u03c9. It\nis clear that the two operators f (A) and I\u2297f (A) coincide on S p \u2297 R(g(A)). To prove that\nthey are equal, it suffices to check that this space is a core for each of them. Since R(g(A))\nis a core for f (A) and I\u2297f (A) is the closure of I \u2297 f (A) : S p \u2297 D(f (A)) \u2192 Y , we obtain\nthat S p \u2297 R(g(A)) is a core of I\u2297f (A).\nNext, let y \u2208 D(f (A)), and let (gn )n\u22651 be the sequence defined by (3.10). By Lemma 3.2,\ngn (A)y converges to y when n \u2192 \u221e, and we also have\nf (A)gn (A)y = gn (A)f (A)y \u2212\u2192 f (A)y\n\nwhen n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nNow let (yk )k be a sequence of S p \u2297 X converging to y. For any fixed n \u2265 1, gn (A)yk belongs\nto S p \u2297 R(g(A)), and we both have\ngn (A)yk \u2212\u2192 gn (A)y\n\nand f (A)gn (A)yk \u2212\u2192 f (A)gn (A)y\n\nwhen k \u2192 \u221e. This proves that S p \u2297 R(g(A)) is a core of f (A) and completes the proof. \u0003\nWe now turn to the special case of sectorial operators defined as negative generators of\nsemigroups. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on X = Lp (M). We say that (Tt )t\u22650 is\na completely bounded semigroup if each Tt is completely bounded and supt\u22650 kTt kcb < \u221e.\nIn this case, each I \u2297 Tt extends to a bounded operator I\u2297Tt : S p [Lp (M)] \u2192 S p [Lp (M)]\nand a standard equicontinuity argument shows that (I\u2297Tt )t\u22650 is a bounded c0 -semigroup on\nY = S p [Lp (M)].\nLemma 3.9. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a completely bounded c0 -semigroup on Lp (M) and let A denote\nits negative generator. Then I\u2297A is the negative generator of (I\u2297Tt )t\u22650 , hence A is cbsectorial of type \u03c02 .\nProof. We let A = I\u2297A, and we let B denote the negative generator of (I\u2297Tt )t\u22650 on Y .\nApplying the Laplace formula (3.2) to (Tt )t\u22650 and to (I\u2297Tt )t\u22650 , we see that I \u2297 (1 + A)\u22121\nand (1 + B)\u22121 coincide on S p \u2297 X. According to Lemma 3.6, this implies that \u22121 \u2208 \u03c1(A)\nand that (1 + A)\u22121 = (1 + B)\u22121 . Thus A = B.\n\u0003\n\n\f29\n\nExample 3.10. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and let (Tt )t\u22650 denote the translation semigroup on Lp (R),\nthat is, (Tt f )(s) = f (s \u2212 t) for s \u2208 R, t \u2265 0. Its negative generator is the derivation operator\nA = dtd , with domain equal to the Sobolev space W 1,p (R). More generally for any Banach\nspace Z, we can define the translation semigroup (TtZ )t\u22650 on Lp (R; Z) by the same formula,\nand its negative generator is the derivation AZ with domain W 1,p (R; Z). It is clear that AZ\ncoincides with A \u2297 IZ on Lp (R) \u2297 Z. We noticed in Remark 2.13 that we have a canonical\nidentification Lp (R; S p ) = S p [Lp (R)]. Hence it follows from Lemma 3.9 that the operator\nI\u2297 dtd coincides with the derivation operator on Lp (R; S p ).\nIt turns out that for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 , the operator AZ has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus if and only if Z is a UMD Banach space (see [20, 32, 69]). Thus if 1 < p < \u221e, the\noperator dtd has a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 , because\nS p is a UMD Banach space.\n3.C. Dilations.\nWe will need the following result due to Hieber and Pr\u00fcss [32].\nProposition 3.11. ([32]) Let Z be a UMD Banach space. Let (Ut )t be a c0 -group of isometries on Z, and let \u2212B denote its infinitesimal generator. Then B has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 . More precisely there exists for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 a constant CX,\u03b8\nonly depending on \u03b8 and X such that kf (B)k \u2264 CX,\u03b8 kf k\u221e,\u03b8 for any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\nIndeed using a transference technique, it is shown in [32] that for any B as above and any\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), one has\nkf (B)k \u2264 kf (AZ )k,\n\nwhere AZ is the derivation operator on L2 (R; Z) discussed in Example 3.10. Since AZ has\na bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 , this yields the result.\n\nExtending previous terminology, we say that a c0 -group (Ut )t on some noncommutative\nL -space X is a completely isometric c0 -group if each Ut : X \u2192 X is a complete isometry.\nIn this case, (I\u2297Ut )t is a c0 -group of isometries on S p [X].\np\n\nProposition 3.12. Let 1 < p < \u221e, and let M be a semifinite von Neumann algebra. Let\n(Tt )t\u22650 be a contractive c0 -semigroup on Lp (M) and let \u2212A denote its infinitesimal generator.\nAssume that there exist another semifinite von Neumann algebra M\u2032 , a c0 -group (Ut )t of\nisometries on Lp (M\u2032 ), and contrative maps J : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M\u2032 ) and Q : Lp (M\u2032 ) \u2192 Lp (M)\nsuch that\n(3.16)\n\nTt = QUt J,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nThen A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 . If further, (Ut )t\nis a completely isometric c0 -group and J and Q are completely contractive, then (Tt )t\u22650 is\ncompletely bounded and A admits a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any\n\u03b8 > \u03c02 .\n\n\f30\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nProof. Let \u2212B denote the infinitesimal generator of (Ut )t on Lp (M\u2032 ). Let z be a complex\nnumber with Re(z) < 0. According to the Laplace formula (3.2), we have\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ntz\nR(z, A) = \u2212\ne Tt dt\nand\nR(z, B) = \u2212\netz Ut dt .\n0\n\n0\n\nHence our dilation assumption (3.16) yields\n\nR(z, A) = QR(z, B)J.\nThen for any \u03b8 >\nhave\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nand any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), we have f (A) = Qf (B)J, by (3.5). Therefore we\n\nkf (A)k \u2264 kQkkJkkf (B)k.\nThe Banach space Lp (M ) is UMD, hence B has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus by\nProposition 3.11. Thus A also has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\nIf J and Q are completely contractive, I \u2297 J and I \u2297 Q extend to contractions\n\u2032\n\nI\u2297J : S p [Lp (M)] \u2212\u2192 S p [Lp (M\u2032 )]\n\nand\n\nI\u2297Q : S p [Lp (M\u2032 )] \u2212\u2192 S p [Lp (M)].\n\nIf we assume that (Ut )t is a completely isometric group, we obtain that (Tt )t\u22650 is a completely\ncontractive c0 -semigroup and we have\nI\u2297Tt = (I\u2297Q)(I\u2297Ut )(I\u2297J),\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nSince S p [Lp (M)] and S p [Lp (M\u2032 )] are noncommutative Lp -spaces, it follows from the first\npart of the proof and Lemma 3.9 that A = I\u2297A has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus\n\u0003\nfor any \u03b8 > \u03c02 .\nLet M \u2243 L\u221e (\u03a3) be a commutative von Neumann algebra and let (Tt )t\u22650 be a c0 -semigroup\nof positive contractions on Lp (\u03a3). Fendler showed in [27] that there exist a commutative\nLp -space Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ), a c0 -group (Ut )t of isometries on Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ), and contractive maps J : Lp (\u03a3) \u2192\nLp (\u03a3\u2032 ) and Q : Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ) \u2192 Lp (\u03a3) such that Tt = QUt J for any t \u2265 0. (This is a continuous\nversion of Akcoglu's dilation Theorem [1, 2].) Applying Proposition 3.12, we deduce that A\nadmits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 provided that \u2212A generates a\npositive contraction c0 -semigroup on Lp (\u03a3), for 1 < p < \u221e. This result is due to Duong [24]\n(see also [20]). However it is still unknown whether an analog of Fendler's Theorem holds\non noncommutative Lp -spaces, and this is a significant although interesting drawback for\nthe study of completely positive contractive semigroups on noncommutative Lp -spaces. See\nRemark 5.9 for more on this.\n\n\f31\n\n4. Rademacher boundedness and related notions\n4.A. Column boundedness and row boundedness.\nRademacher boundedness [7, 19] has played a prominent role in recent developments of\nH functional calculus, see in particular [42], [79], [80], [48]. On noncommutative Lp -spaces\nit will be convenient to consider two natural variants of this notion that we introduce below\nunder the names of column boundedness and row boundedness.\nLet X be a Banach space and let F \u2282 B(X) be a set of bounded operators on X. We\nsay that F is Rad-bounded if there is a constant C > 0 such that for any finite families\nT1 , . . . , Tn in F, and x1 , . . . , xn in X, we have\n\u221e\n\nn\nX\n\n(4.1)\n\nk=1\n\n\u03b5k Tk (xk )\n\nRad(X)\n\n\u2264C\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b5k xk\n\nRad(X)\n\nk=1\n\n.\n\nIn this definition, the norms k kRad(X) are given by (2.20).\n\nLet (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra, let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and assume that\nX = Lp (M). We say that a set F \u2282 B(Lp (M)) is Col-bounded (resp. Row-bounded)\nif there there is a constant C > 0 such that for any finite families T1 , . . . , Tn in F, and\nx1 , . . . , xn in Lp (M), we have\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\nTk (xk )\u2217 Tk (xk )\n(4.2)\n\u2264 C\nx\u2217k xk\nLp (M)\n\nk\n\n(4.3)\n\n\u0012\nresp.\n\n\u0010X\nk\n\nTk (xk )Tk (xk )\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0011 12\n\nLp (M)\n\nLp (M)\n\nk\n\n\u2264 C\n\n\u0010X\nk\n\nxk x\u2217k\n\n\u0011 12\n\nLp (M)\n\n.\n\n\u0013\n\nThe least constant C satisfying (4.1) (resp. (4.2), resp. (4.3)) will be denoted by Rad(F)\n(resp. Col(F ), resp. Row(F )). Obviously any Rad-bounded (resp. Col-bounded, resp.\nRow-bounded) set is bounded but the converse does not hold true except on Hilbert space.\nIt follows from the noncommutative Khintchine inequalities (2.21) and (2.22) that if a set\nF \u2282 B(Lp (M)) is both Col-bounded and Row-bounded, then it is Rad-bounded. Moreover\nthese three notions coincide on commutative Lp -spaces (see Remark 2.13). However this is\nno longer the case in the general noncommutative setting. Indeed let F = {T } \u2282 B(Lp (M))\nbe a singleton, and let H be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Then F is Rad-bounded\nwith Rad(F) = kT k whereas F is Col-bounded if and only if T \u2297 IH extends to a bounded\noperator on Lp (M; Hc ). Indeed this follows from (2.10). Likewise F is Row-bounded if and\nonly if T \u2297 IH extends to a bounded operator on Lp (M; Hr ). Thus applying (2.36) and\n(2.37), the set {T } is both Col-bounded and Row-bounded if T is completely bounded.\nIt turns out that if p 6= 2, one may find T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) such that T \u2297 IH is bounded\non the column space Lp (M; Hc ), but T \u2297IH is not bounded on the row space Lp (M; Hr ), see\nExample 4.1 below. Thus there are sets F which are Rad-bounded and Col-bounded without\nbeing Row-bounded. Similarly, one may find subsets of B(Lp (M)) which are Rad-bounded\n\n\f32\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nand Row-bounded without being Col-bounded, or which are Rad-bounded without being\neither Row-bounded or Col-bounded.\nExample 4.1. Let H be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space and let 1 \u2264 p 6= 2 < \u221e be\nany number. For simplicity we write S p [Hc ] and S p [Hr ] for Lp (B(l2 ); Hc ) and Lp (B(l2 ); Hr )\nrespectively. It is well-known that there exists an operator T : S p \u2192 S p whose tensor extension T \u2297 IH extends to a bounded operator on S p [Hc ] but T \u2297 IH : S p [Hr ] \u2192 S p [Hr ]\nis unbounded. We provide an example for the convenience of the reader not familiar with\nmatricial and operator space techniques.\nWe assume that p < 2, the other case being similar. We regard elements of S p as infinite\nmatrices in the usual way and we let Eij denote the standard matrix units. Let T : S p \u2192 S p\nbe defined by T (E1j ) = Ej1 for any j \u2265 1 and T (Eij ) = 0 for any i \u2265 2 and any j \u2265 1.\nThus T = U \u25e6 P , where U : S p \u2192 S p is the transpose map, and P : S p \u2192 S p is the canonical\nprojection onto the space of matrices which have zero entries except on the first row. It is\neasy to check that kP kcb = 1 and that kUk = 1. Hence kT k = 1. We will show that\nT \u2297 IH : S p [Hc ] \u2212\u2192 S p [Hc ]\n\n(4.4)\n\n= 1.\n\nWe may assume that H = l2 , and we let (ek )k\u22651 denote its canonical basis. Since P is\ncompletely contractive, the operator P \u2297 IH : S p [Hc ] \u2192 S p [Hc ] is contractive, by (2.36).\nHence it suffices to show that U \u2297 IH is contractive on Span{E1j \u2297 ek : j, k \u2265 1} \u2282 S p \u2297 H.\nLet (\u03b1jk )j,k\u22651 be a finite family of complex numbers and let\nX\n\u03b1jk E1j \u2297 ek .\nu=\nj,k\n\nApplying (2.10), we find that\nkukS p [Hc ] =\nSince\n\nP\n\nj,k,m \u03b1jk\n\n\u03b1mk Ejm =\n\n\u0010P\n\nj,k\n\n\u0010X\n\n\u03b1jk Ekj\n\n\u03b1jk \u03b1mk Ejm\n\nj,k,m\n\n\u0011\u2217 \u0010P\n\nj,k\n\nkukS p [Hc ] =\n\nApplying the transpose map U, we have\n(U \u2297 IH )u =\n\n\u0011 12\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1jk Ekj\n\nX\n\n\u03b1jk Ej1 \u2297 ek .\n\nj,k\n\n.\n\n\u03b1jk Ekj , we deduce that\n\nX\nj,k\n\nSp\n\nSp\n\n.\n\nThen using (2.10) again we deduce that\n\u0013 12\n\u0012X\nX\n2\n\u03b1jk Ekj\n=\n|\u03b1jk |\nk(U \u2297 IH )ukS p [Hc ] =\nj,k\n\nj,k\n\nS2\n\n.\n\nSince p < 2, we deduce that k(U \u2297 IH )ukS p [Hc ] \u2264 kukS p [Hc ] , which proves (4.4).\n\n\f33\n\nNow essentially reversing the above arguments, we see that if T \u2297IH extends to a bounded\noperator on S p [Hr ] with norm \u2264 K, then for any finite family (\u03b1jk )j,k\u22651 of complex numbers,\nwe have\nX\nX\n\u03b1jk Ekj ,\n\u2264K\n\u03b1jk Ekj\nj,k\n\nSp\n\nS2\n\nj,k\n\nwhich is wrong.\n\nThroughout the rest of this section, M is a semifinite von Neumann algebra and we fix\nsome 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. We will require the following lemma which extends [19, Lemma 3.2].\n\nLemma 4.2. Let F \u2282 B(Lp (M)) be a set of bounded operators, let I be an interval of R,\nlet C > 0 be a constant, and let\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\nZ\n1\n|f (t)| dt \u2264 C .\nf (t)R(t) dt R : I \u2192 F is continuous, f \u2208 L (I; dt), and\nT =\nI\n\nI\n\n(1) If F is Rad-bounded then T is Rad-bounded with Rad(T ) \u2264 2CRad(F).\n(2) If F is Col-bounded (resp. Row-bounded), then T is Col-bounded (resp. Row-bounded)\nwith Col(T ) \u2264 CCol(F) (resp. Row(T ) \u2264 CRow(F)).\n\nProof. For the first assertion, recall that by [19, Lemma 3.2], the closed absolute convex\nhull aco(F) of F is Rad-bounded with Rad(aco(F )) \u2264 2Rad(F). A standard approximation\nargument shows that C1 T \u2282 aco(F ), which proves the result. The same proof yields the\nsecond assertion, except that the factor 2 does not appear.\n\u0003\nIt was observed in [80, 4.a] that given a measure space \u03a3, an interval I \u2282 R, and a strongly\ncontinuous function \u03a6 : I \u2192 B(Lp (\u03a3)), then the set {\u03a6(t) : t \u2208 I} is Rad-bounded if and\nonly if there is a constant C > 0 such that\n\u0012Z\n\u0012Z\n\u0013 21\n\u0013 12\n2\n2\n\u03a6(t)u(t) dt\nu(t) dt\n\u2264C\nI\n\np\n\nI\n\np\n\nfor any measurable function u : I \u2192 Lp (\u03a3) belonging to Lp (\u03a3; L2 (I)). The aim of Proposition\n4.4 below is to extend this result to our noncommutative setting. We will need a standard\napproximation procedure that we briefly recall (see e.g. [23, III.2 Lemma 1] for details).\nLet (\u03a9, \u03bc) be a \u03c3-finite measure space. By a subpartition of \u03a9, we mean a finite set\n\u03c0 = {I1 , . . . , Im } of pairwise disjoint measurable subsets of \u03a9 such that 0 < \u03bc(Ii ) < \u221e for\nany 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. Let Z be a Banach space and let \u03c0 be a subpartition of \u03a9. We may define\na linear mapping E\u03c0 on Lp (\u03a9; Z) by letting\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nm\nX\n1\nu(t) d\u03bc(t) \u03c7Ii ,\nu \u2208 Lp (\u03a9; Z).\n(4.5)\nE\u03c0 (u) =\n\u03bc(Ii ) Ii\ni=1\n\nHere \u03c7I denotes the indicator function if I. Then the mapping E\u03c0 : Lp (\u03a9; Z) \u2192 Lp (\u03a9; Z) is\na contraction. Further if subpartitions are directed by refinement, then we have\n(4.6)\n\nlim kE\u03c0 u \u2212 ukp = 0,\n\u03c0\n\nu \u2208 Lp (\u03a9; Z).\n\n\f34\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThe use of the same notation E\u03c0 for all Z and all p should not create any confusion. The\nfollowing elementary lemma is easy to deduce from (4.6) and its proof is left to the reader.\nLemma 4.3. Let (\u03a9, \u03bc) be a \u03c3-finite measure space. Then for any a, b \u2208 L2 (\u03a9) and for any\nc \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9), we have\nZ\nZ\ncab = lim E\u03c0 (c)E\u03c0 (a)E\u03c0 (b) .\n\u03a9\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03a9\n\nLet (\u03a9, \u03bc) be a \u03c3-finite measure space. If \u03a6 : \u03a9 \u2192 B(Lp (M)) is any bounded measurable\nfunction, we may define a multiplication operator T\u03a6 : L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) \u2192 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)) by\nletting\n\u0001\nT\u03a6 (u) (t) = \u03a6(t)u(t),\nu \u2208 L2 (\u03a9; Lp (M)).\n\nProposition 4.4. Let \u03a6 : (\u03a9, \u03bc) \u2192 B(Lp (M)) be a bounded measurable function and consider the bounded set\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n1\n\u03a6(t) d\u03bc(t) : I \u2282 \u03a9, 0 < \u03bc(I) < \u221e \u2282 B(Lp (M)).\nF=\n\u03bc(I) I\n(1) If the set F is Col-bounded, then\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c )\n\nboundedly.\n\n(2) If the set F is Row-bounded, then\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)r )\n\nboundedly.\n\n(3) If the set F is Rad-bounded, then\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)rad )\n\nboundedly.\n\nProof. We first assume that F is Col-bounded and we shall prove (1) by using duality. We\nlet p\u2032 = p/(p \u2212 1) be the conjugate number of p. Then we let u \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9) and\n\u2032\nv \u2208 Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a9). They may be written as\nX\nX\nxk \u2297 ak\nand\nv=\nyj \u2297 bj ,\nu=\nk\n\nj\n\n\u2032\n\nfor some finite families (ak )k \u2282 L2 (\u03a9), (xk )k \u2282 Lp (M), (bj )j \u2282 L2 (\u03a9), and (yj )j \u2282 Lp (M).\nWe claim that there is a constant K > 0 not depending on u and v such that whenever \u03c0 is\na subpartition of \u03a9, we have\nXZ\n\u0001\nE\u03c0 h\u03a6(* )xk , yj i E\u03c0 (ak )E\u03c0 (bj ) \u2264 KkukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\n(4.7)\nk,j\n\n\u03a9\n\n\f35\n\nTaking this for granted for the moment, we deduce that\nZ\nhT\u03a6 (u), vi = h\u03a6(t)u(t), v(t)i d\u03bc(t)\n\u03a9\nXZ\n=\nh\u03a6(t)xk , yj iak (t)bj (t) d\u03bc(t)\nk,j\n\n= lim\n\u03c0\n\n\u03a9\n\nXZ\nk,j\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u0001\nE\u03c0 h\u03a6(* )xk , yj i E\u03c0 (ak )E\u03c0 (bj )\n\nby Lemma 4.3. It therefore follows from (4.7) that\n\nhT\u03a6 (u), vi \u2264 KkukLp (M;L2 (\u03a9)c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a9)r ) .\n\nBy Lemma 2.10, we deduce that T\u03a6 maps L2 (\u03a9) \u2297 Lp (M) into Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) and that\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2264 K.\n\nTo complete the proof of (1), it therefore remains to prove (4.7). We let E = E\u03c0 along the\nproof of this estimate and we assume that E is defined by (4.5).

The rest of the proof of (3) is identical to that of (1), appealing\nto Remark 2.11 in due place.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.5. Let \u03a6 and F be as in Proposition 4.4. It follows from the above proof that\nif F is Col-bounded, then the norm of T\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) is less than or\nequal to Col(F ). Similar comments apply to the row case and to the Rademacher case, up\nto absolute constants.\nRemark 4.6. Let \u03a6 : \u03a9 \u2192 B(Lp (M)) be a bounded measurable function, and assume\nthat T\u03a6 maps Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) into itself boundedly. If u \u2208 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) is a measurable\nfunction (in the sense of Definition 2.7), then T\u03a6 u also is a measurable function, namely\n[T\u03a6 u](t) = \u03a6(t)u(t). Indeed this is obvious if p \u2264 2. Then if p > 2, let us consider\n\n\f37\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2032\ny \u2208 Lp (M) and b \u2208 L2 (\u03a9).

Col-sectorial, Row-sectorial, and Rad-sectorial operators.\nFollowing [42], we say that an operator A on some Banach space X is Rad-sectorial of\nRad-type \u03c9 if A is sectorial of type \u03c9 and for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0), the set\n\b\n(4.10)\nzR(z, A) : z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8\n\nis Rad-bounded. This is a strengthening of (3.1), which says that the latter set merely has\nto be bounded.\nNext if X = Lp (M), we say that A is Col-sectorial (resp. Row-sectorial) of Col-type (resp.\nRow-type) \u03c9 if the set in (4.10) is Col-bounded (resp. Row-bounded) for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0). If A\nis both Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 and Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9, then is is Rad-sectorial\nof Rad-type \u03c9.\nIn this paragraph, we establish a series of simple results concerning these notions.\nLemma 4.7. Let 1 < p, p\u2032 < \u221e be conjugate numbers, and let A be a sectorial operator\non Lp (M). Let \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) be an angle. Then A is Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 on Lp (M) if\n\u2032\nand only if A\u2217 is Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9 on Lp (M). Moreover A is Rad-sectorial of\n\u2032\nRad-type \u03c9 on Lp (M) if and only if A\u2217 is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9 on Lp (M).\n\u2032\n\nProof. Let F \u2282 B(Lp (M)) be a set of operators, and let F \u2217 = {T \u2217 : T \u2208 F} \u2282 B(Lp (M))\nbe the set of its adjoints. Using (2.15), it is easy to see that F is Col-bounded if and only\nif F \u2217 is Row-bounded. If A is sectorial of type \u03c9 on Lp (M), then A\u2217 is sectorial of type\n\u2032\n\u03c9 on Lp (M), and we have R(z, A)\u2217 = R(z, A\u2217 ) for any z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03c9 . We deduce that A is\nCol-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 if and only if A\u2217 is Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9. The proof of\nthe 'Rad-sectorial' result is similar.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.8. Let \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) be an angle, and let U : \u03a3\u03b8 \u2192 B(Lp (M)) be a strongly continuous\nbounded function whose restriction to \u03a3\u03b8 is analytic. If the set {U(z) : z \u2208 \u2202\u03a3\u03b8 } is Colbounded (resp. Row-bounded, resp. Rad-bounded), then {U(z) : z \u2208 \u03a3\u03b8 } also is Col-bounded\n(resp. Row-bounded, resp. Rad-bounded).\nProof. In the Rademacher case, this result is proved in [79, Proposition 2.8]. The proofs for\nthe other cases are identical, using Lemma 4.2.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.9. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on Lp (M) with infinitesimal generator\n\u2212A, and assume that A is sectorial of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ). Then A is Col-sectorial of Col-type\n\n\f38\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n\u03c9 if and only if for any angle \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c9), the set {Tz : z \u2208 \u03a3\u03b1 } \u2282 B(Lp (M)) is\nCol-bounded. The same result holds with Col-boundedness replaced by Row-boundedness or\nRad-boundedness.\nProof. This result is an analog of Lemma 3.1. Again it is proved in [79, Theorem 4.2] in the\nRademacher case, and the proofs for the other cases are identical.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.10. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on some Banach space X.\nFor any positive real number \u03b1 > 0, we let A\u03b1 denote the corresponding fractional power of\nA. If \u03b1\u03c9 < \u03c0, then A\u03b1 is a sectorial operator of type \u03b1\u03c9 (see e.g. [5, Proposition 5.2]). It\nis well-known to specialists that with the same proof, one obtains that A\u03b1 is Rad-sectorial\nof Rad-type \u03b1\u03c9 if A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9. Moreover if \u03b8 and \u03b1\u03b8 both belong\nto (0, \u03c0), if f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b1\u03b8 ) and if f\u03b1 \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) is defined by f\u03b1 (z) = f (z \u03b1 ), then we have\nf\u03b1 (A) = f (A\u03b1 ). Thus A\u03b1 has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b1\u03b8 ) functional calculus provided that A has\na bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\nNow assume that X = Lp (M) is a noncommutative Lp -space. We observe that mimicking\nagain the proof of [5, Proposition 5.2], and using Lemma 4.2 (2), we have that A\u03b1 is Colsectorial (resp. Row-sectorial) of Col-type (resp. Row-type) equal to \u03b1\u03c9 if A is Col-sectorial\n(resp. Row-sectorial) of Col-type (resp. Row-type) equal to \u03c9.\nIn [42, Theorem 5.3, (3)], Kalton-Weis showed that an operator with a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus on a Banach space X is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03b8 provided that X\nsatisfies a certain geometric property called (\u2206). According to [42, Proposition 3.2], any\nUMD Banach space X satisfies this property. We deduce the following statement.\nTheorem 4.11. Let 1 < p < \u221e and let A be an operator on Lp (M) with a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus. Then A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03b8.\nIn the next statement, we establish a variant of the above result for Col-sectoriality and\nRow-sectoriality (see also Remark 4.13).\nTheorem 4.12. Let A be a sectorial operator on Lp (M), with 1 < p < \u221e. Assume that\nA admits a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for some \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0). Then the\noperator A is both Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03b8 and Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03b8.\nProof. We will only show the 'column' result, the proof for the 'row' one being the same.\nGiven a number \u03bd > \u03b8, we wish to show that the set\n\b\nF \u03bd = zR(z, A) : z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03bd .\n\nis Col-bounded. We consider A = I\u2297A on Y = S p [Lp (M)] (see paragraph 3.B). This is a\nnoncommutative Lp -space, hence applying Theorem 4.11 we obtain that the set\n\b\nT \u03bd = zR(z, A) : z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03bd\n\n\f39\n\nis Rad-bounded. Now consider x1 , . . . , xn in Lp (M) and T1 , . . . , Tn in F \u03bd . For any finite\nsequence (\u03b5k )1\u2264k\u2264n valued in {\u22121, 1}, we have\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\n\u0011 12\n\u2217\n\u2217\n=\n(\u03b5k xk ) (\u03b5k xk )\nxk xk\nk\n\nLp (M)\n\nLp (M)\n\nk\n\nn\nX\n\n=\n\nk=1\n\n\u03b5k Ek1 \u2297 xk\n\nS p [Lp (M)]\n\n(see Remark 2.3 (3)). Then passing to the average over all possible choices of \u03b5k = \u00b11, we\ndeduce that\nn\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\nX\nx\u2217k xk\n\u03b5k (Ek1 \u2297 xk )\n=\nk\n\nLikewise we have\n\u0011 12\n\u0010X\n\u2217\nTk (xk ) Tk (xk )\nk\n\nLp (M)\n\nLp (M)\n\nk=1\n\n=\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\nRad(S p [Lp (M)])\n\n\u03b5k (IS p \u2297 Tk )(Ek1 \u2297 xk )\n\nIt therefore follows from Lemma 3.6 (2), that\n\u0010X\n\u0011 21\n\u0010X\n\u0011 21\n\u2264 Rad(T \u03bd )\nx\u2217k xk\nTk (xk )\u2217 Tk (xk )\nk\n\nLp (M)\n\nThis concludes the proof, with Col(T \u03bd ) \u2264 Rad(T \u03bd ).\n\nk\n\nRad(S p [Lp (M)])\n\nLp (M)\n\n.\n\n.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.13. The complete boundedness assumption in Theorem 4.12 cannot be replaced\nby a boundedness assumption. Indeed assume that 1 \u2264 p 6= 2 < \u221e, let \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) be\nan angle, and assume that M = B(l2 ). According to Example 4.1, we have a bounded\noperator T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) such that T \u2297 IH does not extend to a bounded operator\non Lp (M; Hc ). Shifting T if necessary we may clearly assume that \u03c3(T ) is included in the\nopen set \u03a3\u03c9 . Then T is invertible and \u03c3(T \u22121 ) \u2282 \u03a3\u03c9 . Hence there exists a positive number\n\u03b5 > 0 such that \u03c3(T \u22121 \u2212 \u03b5) \u2282 \u03a3\u03c9 . We let A = T \u22121 \u2212 \u03b5. By construction, A is a bounded\nand invertible sectorial operator of type \u03c9. Hence it admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c9. However R(\u2212\u03b5, A) = \u2212T , and {T } is not Col-bounded. Hence A\ncannot be Col-sectorial.\n4.C. Some operator valued singular integrals.\nWe wish to prove a criterion for the boundedness of certain operator valued singular\nintegrals which will appear both in Section 6 and in Section 7 below. We shall work on\nthe measure space \u03a90 = (R\u2217+ , dtt ). Let \u03ba : \u03a90 \u00d7 \u03a90 \u2192 B(Lp (M)) be a bounded continuous\nfunction. We may define an operator T : L1 (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)) \u2192 L\u221e (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)) by\nZ \u221e\ndt\nu \u2208 L1 (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)).\nT u(s) =\n\u03ba(s, t)u(t) ,\nt\n0\nThen we say that \u03ba(s, t) is the kernel of T .\n\n\f40\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nIf T maps (L1 (\u03a90 )\u2229L2 (\u03a90 ))\u2297Lp (M) into Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) and if there is a constant C > 0\nsuch that kT ukLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) \u2264 CkukLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) for any u in (L1 (\u03a90 ) \u2229 L2 (\u03a90 )) \u2297 Lp (M),\nthen T uniquely extends to a bounded linear mapping, that we still denote by\nT : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ).\nIndeed, (L1 (\u03a90 ) \u2229 L2 (\u03a90 )) \u2297 Lp (M) is dense in Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ). Moreover a standard approximation argument shows that this extension coincides with the original operator T on\nL1 (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)) \u2229 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ). In this case we simply say that the operator with associated kernel \u03ba(s, t) is bounded on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ). We define similarly the boundedness of T\non Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r ), or on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )rad ).\nFor any angle \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), we define\n(4.11)\n\nH \u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) = \u222a\u03b8>\u03c9 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\n\nand\n\nH0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) = \u222a\u03b8>\u03c9 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\nLet A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M). For any F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) and any t > 0, let\nF (tA) = Ft (A), where Ft (z) = F (tz). Using Lebesgue's Theorem and (3.5), it is not hard\nto see that the function t 7\u2192 F (tA) is continuous and bounded on \u03a90 (see also Lemma 6.5\nbelow). Thus for any F1 , F2 \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ), the kernel \u03ba(s, t) = F2 (sA)F1 (tA) is continuous\nand bounded on \u03a90 \u00d7 \u03a90 . The study of operators associated with such kernels for sectorial\noperators on Hilbert space goes back to [55].\nTheorem 4.14. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M), and let F1 , F2 \u2208\nH0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ).\n(1) If A is Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9, then the operator with kernel F2 (sA)F1 (tA) is\nbounded on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ).\n(2) If A is Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9, then the operator with kernel F2 (sA)F1 (tA) is\nbounded on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r ).\n(3) If A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9, then the operator with kernel F2 (sA)F1 (tA) is\nbounded on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )rad ).\nProof. We shall only prove (1), the proofs of (2) and (3) being similar. We let \u03b8 > \u03c9 be such\nthat F1 , F2 \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and fix some \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03b8). Then applying (3.5) and the homomorphism\nproperty of the H \u221e functional calculus, we may write our kernel as\nZ\n1\nF2 (sz)F1 (tz)R(z, A) dz ,\nt > 0, s > 0.\n(4.12)\nF2 (sA)F1 (tA) =\n2\u03c0i \u0393\u03b3\n). Our assumption\nWe shall apply Proposition 4.4 on the measure space (\u03a9, \u03bc) = (\u0393\u03b3 , dz\nz\nthat A is Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 implies that the set {zR(z, A) : z \u2208 \u0393\u03b3 } is Col-bounded.\nIt therefore follows from Lemma 4.2 that the set\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\ndz\n: I \u2282 \u0393\u03b3 , 0 < \u03bc(I) < \u221e\nzR(z, A)\n\u03bc(I) I\nz\n\n\f41\n\nis Col-bounded as well. Hence by Proposition 4.4, the function\n\u03a6(z) =\n\nzR(z, A)\n2\u03c0i\n\ninduces a bounded multiplication operator\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a9)c ).\n\n(4.13)\n\nOur next goal is to show that we may define bounded linear mappings S1 : L2 (\u03a90 ) \u2192 L2 (\u03a9)\nand S2 : L2 (\u03a9) \u2192 L2 (\u03a90 ) by letting\nZ \u221e\ndt\n(4.14)\nS1 a(z) =\nF1 (tz)a(t) ,\na \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 );\nt\n0\n(4.15)\n\nS2 b(s) =\n\nFirst observe that\n(4.16)\n\nK = sup\nt>0\n\nZ\n\n\u0393\u03b3\n\nZ\n\nF2 (sz)b(z)\n\u0393\u03b3\n\ndz\nF1 (tz)\n<\u221e\nz\n\ndz\n,\nz\n\nb \u2208 L2 (\u03a9).\n\u2032\n\nand\n\nK = sup\nz\u2208\u0393\u03b3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nF1 (tz)\n\ndt\n< \u221e.\nt\n\nR\n, hence K = \u0393\u03b3 F1 (z)\nIndeed, changing z into tz does not change \u0393\u03b3 F1 (tz)\nthis number is finite by (3.6).

Noncommutative diffusion semigroups\nIn this section we will focus on a special class of semigroups acting on noncommutative\nL -spaces. Throughout we let (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra.\nLet T : M \u2192 M be a normal contraction.

Hence the restriction of T to M\u2229L1 (M) (uniquely) extends to a\ncontraction T1 : L1 (M) \u2192 L1 (M). Then according to (2.4), it also extends by interpolation\nto a contraction Tp : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. We write T\u221e = T for convenience.\nThen using the notation introduced in (2.5), we obtain that\n1\n1\n+ \u2032 = 1.\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\nTp\u2217 = Tp\u25e6\u2032 ,\np p\nIndeed this follows from (5.1), and the hypothesis that T\u221e is normal. In particular, the\noperator T2 : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) is selfadjoint.\nIt T is positive, then each Tp is positive, and hence Tp\u25e6 = Tp . Thus in this case, we have\nTp\u2217 = Tp\u2032 for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nIf T : M \u2192 M is a normal selfadjoint contraction as above, we will usually use the same\nnotation T : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) instead of Tp , for all its Lp -realizations.\nLet (Tt )t\u22650 be a semigroup of operators on M. We say that (Tt )t\u22650 is a (noncommutative)\ndiffusion semigroup if each Tt : M \u2192 M is a normal selfadjoint contraction and if for any\nx \u2208 M, Tt (x) \u2192 x in the w \u2217 -topology of M when t \u2192 0+ . It follows from above that such\na semigroup extends to a semigroup of contractions on Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and\nthat (Tt )t\u22650 is a selfadjoint semigroup on L2 (M). Moreover (Tt )t\u22650 is strongly continuous\non Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, by [22, Proposition 1.23]. In general we let \u2212Ap denote the\ninfinitesimal generator of the realization of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (M). If further each Tt : M \u2192 M\nis positive, then\n1\n1\n+ \u2032 = 1.\n1 < p < \u221e,\n(5.2)\nA\u2217p = Ap\u2032 ,\np p\nIndeed in this case, the dual semigroup of the realization of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (M) is exactly the\n\u2032\nrealization of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (M). Note that our terminology extends the one introduced by\nStein in [72, Chapter 3] in the commutative setting.\nRemark 5.1. Let T : M \u2192 M be a normal complete contraction, and assume that T\nis selfadjoint. The tensor extension IB(l2 ) \u2297 T uniquely extends to a normal contraction\nI\u2297T : B(l2 )\u2297M \u2192 B(l2 )\u2297M, and it is easy to check that I\u2297T is selfadjoint. For any\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, let Tp : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) be the Lp -realization of T . Then Tp is completely\ncontractive and I\u2297Tp : S p [Lp (M)] \u2192 S p [Lp (M)] is the Lp -realization of I\u2297T\u221e . This is\n\n\f44\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nproved by applying the above results to I\u2297T\u221e . An alternative route it to apply (2.38) with\np = 1 to obtain that T1 is a complete contraction, and then to deduce that kTp kcb \u2264 1 for\nany p \u2208 (1, \u221e) by interpolation.\n\nLet (Tt )t\u22650 be a noncommutative diffusion semigroup on M. We say that (Tt )t\u22650 is a\ncompletely contractive diffusion semigroup if Tt : M \u2192 M is a complete contraction for any\nt \u2265 0. In this case, (I\u2297Tt )t\u22650 is a noncommutative diffusion semigroup on B(l2 )\u2297M. We\nsay that (Tt )t\u22650 is a completely positive diffusion semigroup if Tt : M \u2192 M is completely\npositive for any t \u2265 0 (see paragraph 2.D). We recall that a completely positive contraction\non a C \u2217 -algebra is a complete contraction (see e.g. [60, Chapter 3]). Thus a completely\npositive diffusion semigroup is a completely contractive one.\nRemark 5.2. We can consider noncommutative diffusion semigroups from a slightly different\npoint of view. Suppose that (Tt )t\u22650 is a selfadjoint semigroup of contractions on L2 (M).\nSuppose further that for any t \u2265 0, Tt extends to a contraction T1,t : L1 (M) \u2192 L1 (M), and\nthat (T1,t )t\u22650 is strongly continuous. Then (Tt )t\u22650 'is' a noncommutative diffusion semigroup.\n\u2217\u25e6\n\u2217\u25e6\n: M \u2192 M is a normal selfadjoint contraction, T1,t\n\u2192 IM in the\nIndeed, for any t \u2265 0, T1,t\n\u2217\u25e6\npoint w \u2217 -topology, and the L2 -realization of T1,t\ncoincides with Tt for any t \u2265 0.\nWe will need the following 'sectorial' form of Stein's interpolation principle (see e.g. [72,\nIII. 2] or [78]). In that statement, we let\nS(\u03b8) = {z \u2208 C\u2217 : 0 \u2264 Arg(z) \u2264 \u03b8}\nfor any angle \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0).\nLemma 5.3. Let (E0 , E1 ) be any interpolation couple of Banach spaces, and for any \u03b1 \u2208\n(0, 1), let E\u03b1 = [E0 , E1 ]\u03b1 be the interpolation space obtained by the complex interpolation\nmethod. We consider a family of bounded operator U(z) : E0 \u2229 E1 \u2192 E0 + E1 for z \u2208 S(\u03b8).\nAssume that:\n(a) For any x \u2208 E0 \u2229 E1 , the function z 7\u2192 U(z)x is continuous and bounded, and its\nrestriction to the interior of S(\u03b8) is analytic.\n(b) For any x \u2208 E0 \u2229 E1 , U(t)x \u2208 E0 and U(tei\u03b8 )x \u2208 E1 for any t > 0, and the resulting\nfunctions t 7\u2192 U(t)x and t 7\u2192 U(tei\u03b8 )x are continuous from (0, \u221e) into E0 and E1\nrespectively.\n(c) There exist nonnegative constants C0 , C1 such that for any x \u2208 E0 \u2229E1 and any t > 0,\nwe have\nkU(t)xkE0 \u2264 C0 kxkE0\n\nand\n\nkU(tei\u03b8 )xkE1 \u2264 C1 kxkE1 .\n\nThen for any number \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and any t > 0, U(tei\u03b1\u03b8 ) maps E0 \u2229 E1 into E\u03b1 , with\nkU(tei\u03b1\u03b8 )xkE\u03b1 \u2264 C01\u2212\u03b1 C1\u03b1 kxkE\u03b1 ,\n\nx \u2208 E0 \u2229 E1 .\n\n\f45\n\nThroughout this section, we let\n\u03c9p = \u03c0\n\n1 1\n\u2212\np 2\n\nfor any 1 < p < \u221e.\nProposition 5.4. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a noncommutative diffusion semigroup on M and for any\n1 < p < \u221e, let \u2212Ap denote the generator of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (M). Then Ap is a sectorial\noperator of type \u03c9p .\nProof. This result is well-known in the commutative case and we simply mimic its proof.\nBy duality we may assume that 1 < p < 2. We let p\u2032 denote the conjugate number of p.\nFirst we note that since (Tt )t\u22650 is a selfadjoint semigroup on L2 (M), then A2 is a positive\nselfadjoint operator. Hence A2 is sectorial of type 0 and by spectral theory,\nTz = e\u2212zA2 : L2 (M) \u2212\u2192 L2 (M)\nis a well-defined contraction for any complex number z such that Re(z) \u2265 0. Let us apply\nLemma 5.3 with E0 = L1 (M), E1 = L2 (M), 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c02 , and U(z)x = Tz x. According to\n(2.4), we have [L1 (M), L2 (M)] 2\u2032 = Lp (M). Hence we obtain that\np\n\n(5.3)\n\nkTz : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)k \u2264 1\n\nfor any z \u2208 C\u2217 such that 0 \u2264 Arg(z) \u2264 p\u03c0\u2032 . Likewise, (5.3) holds true if \u2212 p\u03c0\u2032 \u2264 Arg(z) \u2264 0.\n\u0003\nThen Lemma 3.1 ensures that Ap is sectorial of type \u03c02 \u2212 p\u03c0\u2032 = \u03c9p .\nRemark 5.5. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a noncommutative diffusion semigroup on M, and consider\ntwo numbers 1 < p, q < \u221e. Let \u03c9 = max{\u03c9p , \u03c9q }, so that Ap and Aq are both sectorial\noperators of type \u03c9. It easily follows from the Laplace formula (3.2) and from (3.5) that for\nany \u03b8 > \u03c9 and any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), f (Ap ) and f (Aq ) are consistent operators, that is, they\ncoincide on Lp (M) \u2229 Lq (M). Likewise if Ap and Aq both have dense ranges and admit a\nbounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for some \u03b8 > \u03c9, then f (Ap ) and f (Aq ) are consistent\nfor any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). Indeed for x \u2208 Lp (M) \u2229 Lq (M), gn (Ap )x = gn (Aq )x is a common\napproximation of x in Lp (M) and in Lq (M), by Lemma 3.2. Hence\nf (Ap )x = Lp \u2212 lim(f gn )(Ap )x = Lq \u2212 lim(f gn )(Aq )x = f (Aq )x.\nn\n\nn\n\nThe next theorem is the main result of this section. We refer to paragraph 2.D for the\ndefinition of 2-positivity.\nTheorem 5.6. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a noncommutative diffusion semigroup on M and for any\n1 < p < \u221e, let \u2212Ap denote the generator of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (M).\n(1) If Tt is 2-positive for any t \u2265 0, then Ap is Col-sectorial (resp. Row-sectorial) of\nCol-type (resp. Row-type) equal to \u03c9p .\n(2) If Tt is positive for any t \u2265 0, then Ap is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9p .\n\n\f46\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nProof. (1): We assume that Tt is 2-positive for any t \u2265 0. If 1 < p, p\u2032 < \u221e are conjugate\nnumbers, then A\u2217p = Ap\u2032 by (5.2). According to Lemma 4.7, we may therefore assume that\n2 < p < \u221e in our proof of (1). Our first step consists in showing that the set\nF p = {Tt : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M) : t \u2265 0}\n\nis Col-bounded. Since Tt is 2-positive and contractive, we have\nTt (x)\u2217 Tt (x) \u2264 Tt (x\u2217 x),\n\n(5.4)\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nIndeed if x \u2208 M, this is Choi's extension of the Kadison-Schwarz inequality for 2-positive\nmaps on unital C \u2217 -algebras (see [18] or [60, Ex. 3.4]). For an arbitrary x \u2208 Lp (M), let (xi )i\u22651\nbe a sequence in Lp (M)\u2229M such that kx\u2212xi kp \u2192 0 when i \u2192 \u221e. Then kx\u2217 x\u2212x\u2217i xi k p2 \u2192 0.\np\np\nSince Tt is continuous on L 2 (M) we obtain that Tt (x\u2217 x) is the limit of Tt (x\u2217i xi ) in L 2 (M).\nLikewise since Tt is continuous on Lp (M), we see that Tt (x)\u2217 Tt (x) is the limit of Tt (xi )\u2217 Tt (xi )\np\nin L 2 (M). Since (5.4) holds true for any xi , it holds true for x as well.\nLet t1 , . . . , tn be nonnegative real numbers, and let x1 , . . . xn in Lp (M).

Let 1 < r < \u221e be the conjugate number of 2p . Since k Ttk (x\u2217k xk ) is positive, there\nexists some y \u2208 Lr (M)+ such that kykr = 1 and\nn\nn\nDX\nE\nX\n\u2217\nTtk (xk xk ) p =\nTtk (x\u2217k xk ), y .\n2\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nBy the noncommutative maximal ergodic theorem for positive diffusion semigroups [35, Cor.\n4 (iii)] (see also [36]), there exists some \u03c6 \u2208 Lr (M)+ such that Tt (y) \u2264 \u03c6 for any t > 0 and\nk\u03c6kr \u2264 K, where K \u2265 1 is an absolute constant not depending on y. By assumption the\np\nadjoint of the L 2 -realization of Tt is equal to the Lr -realization of Tt for any t \u2265 0, hence\nn\nn\nE\nDX\nX\nTtk (x\u2217k xk ) p =\nx\u2217k xk , Ttk (y)\n2\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\n\u2264\n\nn\nDX\n\nx\u2217k xk , \u03c6\n\nk=1\n\nn\nX\n\n\u2264 k\u03c6kr\n\u2264K\nThis shows that\nn\n\u0010X\nk=1\n\n\u2217\n\nTtk (xk ) Ttk (xk )\n\n\u0011 21\n\np\n\n\u2264\n\nE\n\nx\u2217k xk\n\nk=1\nn\n\u0010X\n\nx\u2217k xk\n\nk=1\n\n\u221a\n\nK\n\nn\n\u0010X\nk=1\n\n\u0011 12\n\np\n2\n\n2\np\n\nx\u2217k xk\n\n.\n\n\u0011 12\n\np\n\n.\n\n\f47\n\n\u221a\nThus F p is a Col-bounded set, with Col(F p ) \u2264 K.\nWe fix some \u03b2 \u2208 (0, \u03c0p ). Our second step consists in showing that the set\n\b\nG p = Ttei\u03b2 : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M) : t \u2265 0\nis Col-bounded. For we define\n\nq=p\n\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03b2 \u0011\n\u03c0 \u2212 p\u03b2\n\nand\n\n\u03b1=\n\n2\u03b2\n.\n\u03c0\n\nThese numbers are chosen so that 1\u2212\u03b1\n+ \u03b12 = 1p . Thus we have Lp (M) = [Lq (M), L2 (M)]\u03b1\nq\nby (2.4). More generally, it follows from (2.13) that for any positive integer n \u2265 1, we have\nLp (M; (l2n )c ) = [Lq (M; (l2n )c ), L2 (M; (l2n )c )]\u03b1 .\n\n(5.5)\n\nWe consider nonnegative real numbers t1 , . . . , tn , and apply Lemma 5.3 with the spaces\nE0 = Lq (M; (l2n )c ), E1 = L2 (M; (l2n )c ), the angle \u03b8 = \u03c02 , and the mappings U(z) defined by\nletting\nn\nn\n\u0010X\n\u0011 X\nU(z)\nxk \u2297 ek =\nTztk (xk ) \u2297 ek ,\nk=1\n\n2\n\nk=1\n\nq\n\nfor x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 L (M) \u2229 L (M). We note that \u03b2 = \u03b1\u03b8. Since L2 (M; (l2n )c ) = l2n (L2 (M))\n(see Remark 2.3 (1)), and since each Ttei \u03c02 : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) is a contraction, we see that\n\u03c0\n\nkU(tei 2 ) : E1 \u2212\u2192 E1 k \u2264 1,\n\nt > 0.\n\nOn the other hand, using the fact that F q is Col-bounded, we have\nkU(t) : E0 \u2212\u2192 E0 k \u2264 Col(F q ),\n\nt > 0.\n\nHence U(ei\u03b2 ) : E\u03b1 \u2192 E\u03b1 has norm less than or equal to Col(F q )1\u2212\u03b1 .

This shows that G p is Col-bounded.\nBy symmetry, we have that {Tte\u2212i\u03b2 : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) : t \u2265 0} also is a Col-bounded\nsubset of B(Lp (M)). Now appealing to Lemma 4.8, we deduce that the set\n{Tz : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M) : z \u2208 \u03a3\u03b2 }\n\nis Col-bounded. Since this holds true for any \u03b2 < \u03c0p , this implies by Lemma 4.9 that Ap is\nCol-sectorial of Col-type \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c0p .\nA similar proof shows that Ap is Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c0p .\n\n(2): In this part, we only assume that Tt is positive for any t \u2265 0, and aim at showing\nthat Ap is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9p .

Then for\nany 1 < p < \u221e, Ap actually admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p .\nProof. We may assume that p > 2, the proof for p < 2 being the same. As in the proof of\nTheorem 5.6, we need to choose some parameters allowing an efficient use of interpolation\ntheory. We give ourselves two numbers \u03b8 > \u03b4 > \u03c9p . Then we pick \u03b1 \u2208 (0, p2 ) such that\n\u03c0\n(1\u2212\u03b1) < \u03b4. Once \u03b1 is fixed, we let q \u2208 (p, \u221e) be the unique number such that 1p = 1\u2212\u03b1\n+ \u03b12 ,\n2\nq\nso that we have\nLp (M) = [Lq (M), L2 (M)]\u03b1\n\n(5.8)\nby (2.4). Then we choose \u03bd >\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nclose enough to\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nto ensure that \u03bd(1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2264 \u03b4.\n\nFirst assume that A2 , Aq and Ap are invertible, so that we can deal with their imaginary\nis\nis\npowers. Then for any real number s \u2208 R, the imaginary powers Ais\n2 , Aq and Ap are consistent\noperators, by Remark 5.5. Hence (5.8) yields\nis 1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\nkAis\nkAis\np k \u2264 kAq k\n2k .\n\nSince A2 is a positive selfadjoint operator, we have kAis\n2 k = 1, and hence\nis 1\u2212\u03b1\nkAis\n.\np k \u2264 kAq k\n\nAccording to our assumption, the operator Aq admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ) functional calculus.\n\u03bd|s|\nHence applying (3.12) we deduce that there is a constant K > 0 such that kAis\nq k \u2264 Ke\n\n\f50\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nfor any s \u2208 R. Therefore,\n\n1\u2212\u03b1 \u03bd(1\u2212\u03b1)|s|\nkAis\ne\npk \u2264 K\n\n\u2264 K 1\u2212\u03b1 e\u03b4|s| ,\n\ns \u2208 R.\n\nSince Ap admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ) functional calculus, the above estimate and [21, Theorem\n5.4] show that Ap actually admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus, which concludes\nthe proof in the invertible case.\nThe general case can be deduced from above, using Lemma 3.5. Indeed, if \u03b5 > 0 is an\narbitrary positive number, then A2 + \u03b5, Aq + \u03b5 and Ap + \u03b5 are both invertible, hence the\npreceding estimates apply to them. In fact the 'only if' part of Lemma 3.5 and Theorem 3.3\nshow that there is a constant C > 0 not depending on \u03b5 > 0 such that k(Ap + \u03b5)is k \u2264 Ce\u03b4|s|\nfor any s \u2208 R. Then the proof of [21, Theorem 5.4] shows that the operators Ap +\u03b5 uniformly\nadmit a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus, and the result follows from the 'if' part of\nLemma 3.5.\nWe note in passing that in the case when each Tt is positive, this proposition has a shorter\nproof. Indeed in that case it directly follows from Theorem 5.6 and [42, Proposition 5.1]. \u0003\nRemark 5.9. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a diffusion semigroup on a commutative von Neumann algebra\nL\u221e (\u03a3).\n(1) For any 1 < p < \u221e and for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p , Ap admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus on Lp (\u03a3). This result is due to Cowling [20]. The question whether this holds true\nfor noncommutative diffusion semigroups is open.\nA sketch of proof of Cowling's Theorem goes as follows. First one can show (see [27]) that\nfor any 1 < p < \u221e, there exist a commutative Lp -space Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ), a c0 -group (Ut )t of isometries\non Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ), and contractive maps J : Lp (\u03a3) \u2192 Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ) and Q : Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ) \u2192 Lp (\u03a3) such that\n\n(5.9)\n\nTt = QUt J,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nThen by Proposition 3.12, Ap admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 .\nApplying the above Proposition 5.8 yields the result.\n(2) For any t \u2265 0, Tt is both a contraction on L\u221e (\u03a3) and on L1 (\u03a3). Hence for any\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e, Tt : Lp (\u03a3) \u2192 Lp (\u03a3) is contractively regular in the sense of [61]. Thus for any\nBanach space X, Tt \u2297 IX extends to contraction from Lp (\u03a3; X) into itself.\nLet M be any semifinite von Neumann algebra, and let N = L\u221e (\u03a3)\u2297M. Then we have\na canonical identification\nLp (N ) = Lp (\u03a3; Lp (M)).\nHence applying the above tensor extension property with X = Lp (M), we deduce that for\nany t \u2265 0, Tt \u2297 IM extends to a normal contraction\nTt \u2297IM : N \u2212\u2192 N ,\n\nand that (Tt \u2297IM )t\u22650 is a diffusion semigroup on N . We claim that for any 1 < p < \u221e and\nany \u03b8 > \u03c9p , the negative generator of its Lp realization admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus.\n\n\f51\n\nIndeed, let 1 < p < \u221e. According to [27], the dilation property (5.9) can be achieved with\nthe additional property that J, Q, and Ut (for any t) are contractively regular. This gives\nrise to contractions\nand\n\nJ\u2297ILp (M) : Lp (\u03a3; Lp (M)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ; Lp (M))\n\nQ\u2297ILp (M) : Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ; Lp (M)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (\u03a3; Lp (M)).\nLikewise, the Ut \u2297ILp (M) 's extend to a c0 -group (Ut \u2297ILp (M) )t of isometries on Lp (\u03a3\u2032 ; Lp (M)),\nand we have\nTt \u2297ILp (M) = (Q\u2297ILp (M) )(Ut \u2297ILp (M) )(J\u2297ILp (M) ),\n\nWe can therefore conclude as in (1) above.\nWe refer the reader to [56] for related results.\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nRemark 5.10. We wish to record for further use an observation on the constants appearing\nin the proof of Proposition 5.8. If (Tt )t\u22650 is a noncommutative diffusion semigroup as in this\nproposition, if 1 < p < \u221e, and if \u03b8 > \u03c9p , let\n\u03c0p,\u03b8 : H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) \u2212\u2192 B(Lp (M))\n\nbe the bounded homomorphism taking any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) to f (Ap ).\nFor any 1 < p < \u221e and any \u03b8 > \u03c9p , let q > p and \u03bd > \u03c02 be chosen as in the first\nlines of the proof of Proposition 5.8. Then it follows from the latter that for any constants\nK, K \u2032 \u2265 1, there exists a constant K \u2032\u2032 \u2265 1 such that whenever (Tt )t\u22650 is a noncommutative\ndiffusion semigroup on M, then k\u03c0p,\u03b8 k \u2264 K \u2032\u2032 provided that k\u03c0p,\u03bd k \u2264 K and k\u03c0q,\u03bd k \u2264 K \u2032 .\n\n\f52\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n6. Square functions on noncommutative Lp -spaces\n6.A. Square functions and their integral representations.\nIn this section we introduce square functions associated to sectorial operators on noncommutative Lp -spaces, which generalize the ones considered in [21] in the commutative setting.\nThroughout we let (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra. As in the previous section,\nwe use the notation\n\u0001\n\u03a90 = R\u2217+ , dtt .\n\nWe also recall the definition of H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) given by (4.11).\nLet 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M). For any F in\n\u221e\nH0 (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) \\ {0} and any x in Lp (M), we define\n(6.1)\n\nkxkF,c = t 7\u2192 F (tA)x\n\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n\nand\n\nkxkF,r = t 7\u2192 F (tA)x\n\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r )\n\n.\n\nWe already noticed that the function t 7\u2192 F (tA) is a continuous function from \u03a90 into\nB(Lp (M)) (see paragraph 4.C). In particular, the function t 7\u2192 F (tA)x is continuous hence\nmeasurable from \u03a90 into Lp (M). Thus according to Definition 2.7 (1), it makes sense to\nwonder whether it belongs either to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) or to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r ). The proper\nmeaning of (6.1) is therefore the following. If t 7\u2192 F (tA)x belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) (resp.\nLp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r )), then kxkF,c (resp. kxkF,r ) is the norm of that function in Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n(resp. Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r )). Otherwise, kxkF,c (resp. kxkF,r ) is equal to \u221e.\nIt is easy to check that the set of all x \u2208 Lp (M) for which kxkF,c < \u221e is a subspace of\nLp (M) on which k kF,c is a seminorm. The same comment applies to k kF,r .\nWe now consider a 'symmetric' form of these seminorms. For F and x as above, we set\nkxkF = t 7\u2192 F (tA)x\n\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )rad )\n\n.\n\nGoing back to the definition of L2 (\u03a90 )rad (see paragraph 2.B), we have more explicitly\no\nn\n(6.2)\nkxkF = max F (* A)x Lp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) , F (* A)x Lp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r ) if 2 \u2264 p < \u221e;\nand\n\nn\no\n(6.3) kxkF = inf ku1kLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) + ku2 kLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r ) : u1 + u2 = F (* A)x if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2.\n\nWe call square functions associated with A the above functions k kF,c , k kF,r , and k kF . It\nshould be noticed that in general, column square functions k kF,c and row square functions\nk kF,r are not equivalent. See Appendix 12.A for a concrete example.\nIt follows from Remark 2.13 that in the case when M \u2243 L\u221e (\u03a3) is a commutative von\nNeumann algebra, the quantities kxkF,c , kxkF,r , and kxkF all coincide on Lp (\u03a3). Indeed,\nthey are equal to\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u00131\n2 dt 2\n\u0001\n(6.4)\nF (tA)x (* )\n,\nt\n0\nLp (\u03a3)\nand hence the square function k kF coincides with the one from [21] in this case.\n\n\f53\n\nIn order to stick to (6.4) in the noncommutative case, it is desirable to have an integral\nrepresentation of the norm on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) and on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r ). This is essentially\nprovided by the next two propositions. In these statements, we shall only consider the\ncolumn case, and the row case may be treated similarly. The results established below will\nbe used later on for a function u of the form\nt \u2208 \u03a90 .\n\nu(t) = F (tA)x,\n\nWe recall Proposition 2.5 which is used in Lemma 6.1 and Proposition 6.2 below.\nLemma 6.1. Assume that 2 \u2264 p < \u221e and let u \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)) \u2282 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ). Then\np\nthe function t 7\u2192 u(t)\u2217 u(t) belongs to L1 (\u03a90 , L 2 (M)), and we have\nZ \u221e\ndt\n\u2217\n(6.5)\nu u=\nu(t)\u2217 u(t) .\nt\n0\np\n\n(Here, as explained in paragraph 2.B, we regard u\u2217 u as an element of L 2 (M).)\n\nProof. For any t > 0 we have\nku(t)\u2217 u(t)kL 2p (M) = ku(t)k2Lp (M) ,\n\np\n\nhence the function u(* )\u2217u(* ) clearly belongs to the space L1 (\u03a90 ; L 2 (M)). To prove (6.5),\nassume first that u belongs to Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a90 ), and let (ak )k and (xk )k be finite families in\nP\nL2 (\u03a90 ) and Lp (M) respectively such that u = k xk \u2297 ak .

Then un also converges to u in Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ), hence u\u2217n un converges\np\nto u\u2217 u in L 2 (M). Furthermore we know from above that each un satisfies (6.5) hence passing\nto the limit, we deduce (6.5) for u.\n\u0003\nProposition 6.2. Assume that 2 \u2264 p < \u221e and let u : \u03a90 \u2192 Lp (M) be any continuous\nfunction. The following two assertions are equivalent.\n(i) u belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ).\n(ii) There is a constant K > 0 such that for any 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u221e, we have\nZ \u03b2\ndt\nu(t)\u2217 u(t)\n\u2264 K 2.\np\nt\n\u03b1\nL 2 (M)\n\nIn that case, we have\n(6.6)\n\n\u2217\n\nu u=\n\nlim\n\n\u03b1\u21920; \u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u03b2\n\nu(t)\u2217 u(t)\n\u03b1\n\ndt\nt\n\n\f54\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nand\n(6.7)\n\nkukLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) =\n\nlim\n\n\u03b1\u21920; \u03b2\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b1\n\ndt\nu(t) u(t)\nt\n\u2217\n\n\u0013 12\n\n.\nLp (M)\n\nProof. We assume (i). For any 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u221e, we let P\u03b1,\u03b2 : L2 (\u03a90 ) \u2192 L2 (\u03a90 ) be the\northogonal projection defined by letting P\u03b1,\u03b2 (a) = a\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) for any a \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 ). According to\nLemma 2.4, ILp \u2297 P\u03b1,\u03b2 extends to a contraction\np\n2\np\n2\nPd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 : L (M; L (\u03a90 )c ) \u2212\u2192 L (M; L (\u03a90 )c ).\n\nIt is plain that Pd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u) is equal to the product function u\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) .\n2\np\nOur hypothesis that u is continuous ensures that Pd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u) belongs to L (\u03a90 ; L (M)). Owing\nto Lemma 6.1, we then have\nZ \u03b2\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\ndt\nd\nd\n(6.8)\nP\u03b1,\u03b2 (u) P\u03b1,\u03b2 (u) =\nu(t)\u2217 u(t) .\nt\n\u03b1\n\nBy (2.8), we have\n\nPd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u)\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\nPd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u)\n\n\u0001\n\np\n2\n\n= Pd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u)\n\n2\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n\n\u2264 kuk2Lp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) .\n\nHence (ii) holds true, with K = kukLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) .\nNext we observe that P\u03b1,\u03b2 converges pointwise to the identity on L2 (\u03a90 ), when \u03b1 \u2192 0 and\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e. Hence ILp \u2297 P\u03b1,\u03b2 converges pointwise to the identity on Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a90 ). Since\nd\nkPd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 k \u2264 1 for any \u03b1 and \u03b2, we deduce that P\u03b1,\u03b2 converges pointwise to the identity on\nLp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ). Thus Pd\n\u03b1,\u03b2 (u) \u2192 u, and (6.6) and (6.7) follow from (6.8).\nFor the converse direction, we assume (ii) and we let p\u2032 be the conjugate number of p. Let\n\u2032\nv be an arbitrary element of Lp (M) \u2297 L2 (\u03a90 ), and consider 0 < \u03b1 < \u03b2 < \u221e . The function\nu\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ), and by (2.8) and Lemma 6.1, we have\n1\nZ \u03b2\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001 12\ndt 2\n\u2217\n.\n=\nu\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) Lp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) = u\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) u\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2)\nu(t) u(t)\np\nL 2 (M)\nt L p2 (M)\n\u03b1\nMoreover we have\nZ \u03b2\n\u03b1\n\nhv(t), u(t)i\n\ndt\n\u2264 ku\u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) kLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r )\nt\n\nby Lemma 2.8.

The obstacle here is that if\nwe consider a measurable function u : \u03a90 \u2192 Lp (M), then the function t 7\u2192 u(t)\u2217 u(t) is\n\n\f55\np\n\nvalued in L 2 (M) which is not a Banach space if p < 2. Thus in general we have no way\nR\u03b2\nto define a Bochner integral \u03b1 u(t)\u2217 u(t) dtt . To circumvent this difficulty, we will consider\napproximation by simple functions provided by 'conditional expectations' associated with\nsubpartitions.

Equivalence of square functions.\nSquare functions associated to a sectorial operator were first introduced on Hilbert spaces\nby McIntosh ([54]). Then it was shown in [55] that they are all equivalent and that any\nsectorial operator (on Hilbert space) has a bounded H \u221e functional calculus with respect to\nk kF . In [50], these results were extended to Rad-sectorial operators on classical (=commutative) Lp -spaces. Our objective (Theorem 6.7 below) is an extension of the latter results to\nnoncommutative Lp -spaces.\nWe will need the following simple lemma.\nLemma 6.5. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M), with 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Let\nF \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ).\n(1) For any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ), the function t 7\u2192 F (tA)f (A) from \u03a90 into B(Lp (M)) is\nabsolutely integrable and\n\u0013\n\u0012Z \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndt\ndt\nf (A).\n=\nF (t)\nF (tA)f (A)\nt\nt\n0\n0\n\n(2) For any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ), supt>0 kF (tA)f (A)k < \u221e .\n(3) Assume that A is Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 and let \u03b8 > \u03c9 such that F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\nThen there is a constant K > 0 such that for any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), the set of all\nF (tA)f (A) for t > 0 is Col-bounded, with\n\u0010\b\n\u0011\nCol F (tA)f (A) : t > 0 \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 .\n\n(4) The result in (3) holds true with Row-boundedness or Rad-boundedness replacing Colboundedness.\n\nProof. The first two assertions hold true in any Banach space and go back (at least implicitly)\nto McIntosh's earliest paper on H \u221e functional calculus [54]. To prove (3), we essentially\n\n\f57\n\nrepeat McIntosh's proof of (2). Given \u03b8 > \u03c9 and F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), let \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03b8) be an\nintermediate angle and recall from (4.16) that\nZ\ndz\n< \u221e.\n|F (tz)|\nK0 = sup\nz\nt>0 \u0393\u03b3\nUsing (3.5), we now write\n1\nF (tA)f (A) =\n2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\nF (tz)f (z)R(z, A) dz\n\u0393\u03b3\n\nfor any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any t > 0. Our assumption implies that the set {zR(z, A) : z \u2208 \u0393\u03b3 }\nis Col-bounded. Moreover\nZ\ndz\n|F (tz)f (z)|\n\u2264 K0 kf k\u221e,\u03b8\nz\n\u0393\u03b3\n\nfor any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any t > 0. We therefore deduce (3) from the second part of Lemma\n4.2. The last assertion (4) can be proved in the same manner.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.6. Let A be a sectorial opertor of type \u03c9 on Lp (M) and let F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) \\ {0}.\nThen\nkxkF,c = 0 \u21d4 kxkF,r = 0 \u21d4 kxkF = 0 \u21d4 x \u2208 N(A).\nIndeed each of the first three conditions means that F (tA)x = 0 for any t > 0, and this\nobviously holds if x \u2208 N(A). Assume conversely that F (tA)x = 0 for any t > 0. Then\nFe(tA)F (tA)x = 0 for any t > 0, where Fe is defined by (3.8). Since\nZ \u221e\ndt\n= kF k2L2 (\u03a90 ) > 0,\nFe(t)F (t)\nt\n0\nthe first part of Lemma 6.5 ensures that f (A)x = 0 for any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ). Using e.g.\nf (z) = g(z) = z(1 + z)\u22122 , this implies that x \u2208 N(A).\nThus if A is injective, k kF,c , k kF,r , and k kF are norms on the respective subspaces of\np\nL (M) on which they are finite.\n\nTheorem 6.7. Assume that 1 < p < \u221e. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M),\nand let \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0). We consider two functions F and G in H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) \\ {0}.\n(1) If A is Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9, then there exists a constant C > 0 such that for\nany f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any x \u2208 Lp (M), we have\nkf (A)xkF,c \u2264 Ckf k\u221e,\u03b8 kxkG,c .\n\nMoreover we have an equivalence\n\nkxkG,c \u224d kxkF,c ,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n(2) If A is Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9, then the same properties hold with k kF,r and\nk kG,r replacing k kF,c and k kG,c .\n(3) If A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9, then the same properties hold with k kF and k kG\nreplacing k kF,c and k kG,c .\n\n\f58\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nProof. We shall only prove (1), the proofs of (2) and (3) being identical. Since G \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nis a non zero function, we can choose \u03c61 and \u03c62 in H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) with the property that\nZ \u221e\ndt\n= 1.\n\u03c61 (t)\u03c62 (t)G(t)\nt\n0\nWe consider some f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). According to Lemma 6.5 (1), the function mapping any\nt > 0 to \u03c61 (tA)\u03c62 (tA)G(tA)f (A) is absolutely integrable on \u03a90 , and\nZ \u221e\ndt\n(6.11)\n\u03c61 (tA)\u03c62 (tA)G(tA)f (A)\n= f (A).\nt\n0\nOn the other hand, it follows from Lemma 6.5 (3), and our hypothesis that A is Col-sectorial\nof Col-type \u03c9, that the set of all operators \u03c62 (tA)f (A) is Col-bounded and that we have an\nestimate\n\u0010\b\n\u0011\nCol \u03c62 (tA)f (A) : t > 0 \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\nwhere K > 0 is a constant not depending on f . Let us now apply Proposition 4.4 and its\nsubsequent Remark 4.5, with \u03a9 = \u03a90 , d\u03bc(t) = dtt , and\n\u03a6(t) = \u03c62 (tA)f (A),\n\nt > 0.\n\nBy Lemma 4.2, we deduce from above that\n\u001b\u0013\n\u0012\u001a\nZ\ndt\n1\n\u03c62 (tA)f (A)\n: I \u2282 \u03a90 , 0 < \u03bc(I) < \u221e\n\u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 .\nCol\n\u03bc(I) I\nt\n\nThen we obtain that the multiplication operator T\u03a6 is bounded on Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ), with\nT\u03a6 : Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n\n\u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 .\n\nAssume that kxkG,c < \u221e, so that G(* A)x belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ). By Remark 4.6,\nT\u03a6 (G(* A)x) is equal to the function \u03c62 (* A)G(* A)f (A)x. Hence we have proved that the\nlatter function belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ), with\n(6.12)\n\n\u03c62 (* A)G(* A)f (A)x\n\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n\n\u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 kxkG,c .\n\nWe now apply Theorem 4.14 with F1 = \u03c61 and F2 = F . According to our hypothesis that\nA is Col-sectorial, the operator T with kernel F (sA)\u03c61 (tA) is bounded from Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c )\ninto itself. Furthermore, Lemma 6.5 (1) ensures that the function \u03c62 (* A)G(* A)f (A)x belongs to L1 (\u03a90 ; Lp (M)). Hence T maps this function to the function\nZ \u221e\ndt\ns 7\u2192\nF (sA)\u03c61 (tA)\u03c62 (tA)G(tA)f (A)x .\nt\n0\nBy (6.11), the above integral is equal to F (sA)f (A)x. This shows that F (* A)f (A)x is a\nfunction which belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) and using (6.12), we have the estimate\nF (* A)f (A)x\n\nLp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c )\n\n\u2264 KkT kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 kxkG,c .\n\nThis concludes the proof of the first part of (1), with C = KkT k.\nTo prove the second part, we will use the fact that Lp (M) is reflexive (we assumed that\n1 < p < \u221e). By Remark 3.4, we have a direct sum decomposition Lp (M) = N(A) \u2295 R(A).\n\n\f59\n\nMoreover kxkF,c = kxkG,c = 0 for every x \u2208 N(A). Thus to prove that k kF,c and k kG,c\nare equivalent on Lp (M), it suffices to prove that they are equivalent on R(A). Let (gn )n\u22650\nbe the bounded sequence of H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) defined by (3.10) and let C \u2032 = supn\u22650 {kgn k\u221e,\u03b8 }. The\npreceding estimate yields\nkgn (A)xkF,c \u2264 CC \u2032 kxkG,c ,\n\nn \u2265 1, x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\u2032\n\nLet x \u2208 R(A) and let v be an arbitrary element of Lp (M)\u2297L2 (\u03a90 ), where p\u2032 is the conjugate\nnumber of p. For any n \u2265 1, we have by Lemma 2.8 that\nZ \u221e\ndt\n\u2264 F (* A)gn(A)x Lp (M;L2 (\u03a90 )c ) kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r )\nhv(t), F (tA)gn (A)xi\nt\n0\n\u2264 kgn (A)xkF,c kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r )\n\u2264 CC \u2032 kxkG,c kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r ) .\n\nSince x \u2208 R(A), gn (A)x converges to x, by Lemma 3.2. Hence applying Fatou's Lemma\nimmediately leads to\nZ \u221e\ndt\nhv(t), F (tA)xi\n\u2264 CC \u2032 kxkG,c kvkLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )r ) .\nt\n0\nOwing to Lemma 2.10, this shows that F (* A)x belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ), with\nkxkF,c \u2264 CC \u2032 kxkG,c .\n\nSwitching the roles of F and G then shows that k kG,c and k kF,c are actually equivalent on\nR(A), which concludes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f60\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n7. H \u221e functional calculus and square function estimates.\nIn this section we investigate the interplay between bounded or completely bounded H \u221e\nfunctional calculus and square functions, for a sectorial operator on noncommutative Lp space. Our results should be regarded as noncommutative analogues of those proved by\nCowling, Doust, McIntosh, and Yagi in [21, Sections 4 and 6]. For simplicity we will restrict\nto the case when p > 1, although some of the results of this section extend to the case when\np = 1. We recall the notation \u03a90 = (R\u2217+ , dtt ).\nLet A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on some noncommutative Lp -space Lp (M),\nwith 1 < p < \u221e.

Let G \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) \\ {0}.\nWe say that A satisfies a dual square function estimate (S \u2217G ) if A\u2217 satisfies a square function\nestimate with respect to G, that is, there is a constant K > 0 such that\n(S \u2217G )\n\nG(* A\u2217 )y\n\nLp\u2032 (M;L2 (\u03a90 )rad )\n\n\u2264 Kkykp\u2032 ,\n\n\u2032\n\ny \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nWe notice the following consequence of Theorem 6.7 (3).\nCorollary 7.1. Assume that A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9 on Lp (M). If A satisfies\n(S F ) for some F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) \\ {0}, then A satisfies (S F ) for all F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ) \\ {0}.\nOur next statement extends some estimates from [21, Section 4 and 6] to the noncommutative setting. Keeping the notation from the latter paper we let \u03c6e (t) = \u03c6(et ) for any\nmeasurable function \u03c6 : \u03a90 \u2192 C. Thus \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6e induces an isometric isomorphism from\nLp (\u03a90 ) onto Lp (R; dt) for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. We let c\n\u03c6e be the Fourier transform of \u03c6e if \u03c6\n1\n2\nbelongs either to L (\u03a90 ) or to L (\u03a90 ).\nProposition 7.2. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 on Lp (M), with 1 < p < \u221e.\nConsider three numbers \u03b4, \u03bd, \u03b1 such that \u03c9 < \u03b4 < \u03b1 < 2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03bd < \u03c0 , and two functions\ne , where G(z)\ne\nF, G \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b4 ).

The assumption (7.1) ensures that there is a constant C1 > 0 with the following\nproperty. For any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ), there exists a function b \u2208 L1 (\u03a90 ) \u2229 L\u221e (\u03a90 ) such that\nkbk\u221e \u2264 C1 kf k\u221e,\u03bd\n\n(7.2)\nand\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n,\nz \u2208 \u03a3\u03b4 .\nt\n0\nIndeed this follows from the proof of [21, Theorem 4.4], see in particular\n(4.3) in that paper.\nR\u221e\n1\nSince b \u2208 L (\u03a90 ), the second part of Lemma 6.5 ensures that 0 |b(t)|k\u03c6(tA)k dtt is finite.\nA simple computation using Fubini's Theorem then shows that\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndt\ndt\ne\nf (A) =\nb(t)\u03c6(tA)\n=\nb(t)G(tA)F\n(tA) .\nt\nt\n0\n0\nf (z) =\n\nb(t)\u03c6(tz)\n\n\u2032\n\nFor any x \u2208 Lp (M) and any y \u2208 Lp (M) = Lp (M)\u2217 , we derive using (3.9) that\nZ \u221e\ndt\nhf (A)x, yi =\nhb(t)F (tA)x, G(tA\u2217 )yi .\nt\n0\n\nHence\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n.\nt\n0\nNow assume that kxkF < \u221e, that is, F (* A)x belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )rad ). We assumed\n\u2032\nthat A satisfies (S \u2217G ), so that G(* A\u2217 )y belongs to Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )rad ). Hence by Remark 2.9,\nthere is a constant C2 > 0 such that\nhf (A)x, yi \u2264 kbk\u221e\n\nhF (tA)x, G(tA\u2217 )yi\n\nhf (A)x, yi \u2264 C2 kbk\u221e kxkF kyk.\nApplying (7.2) then yields\nf (A)x, yi \u2264 C1 C2 kxkF kykkf k\u221e,\u03bd .\n\n\u2032\n\nThe result therefore follows by taking the supremum over all y \u2208 Lp (M) with kyk \u2264 1. \u0003\nRemark 7.3. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on Lp (M), with 1 < p < \u221e.\nGiven any \u03bd \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0), choose \u03b4 and \u03b1 such that \u03c9 < \u03b4 < \u03b1 < 2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03bd.

For this specific pair (F, G) of non zero functions in\nH0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ), we obtain that if A satisfies (S F ) and (S \u2217G ), then it admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03bd )\nfunctional calculus.

See [49, Section 5] for\nan example on Hilbert space.\nWe now turn to the converse of Corollary 7.4 and an equivalence result.\nTheorem 7.6. Let A be a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) on Lp (M), with 1 < p < \u221e.\nAssume that A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for some \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0).\n\n(1) Then A satisfies a square function estimate (S F ) and a dual square function estimate\n(S \u2217G ) for any F, G \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8+ ) \\ {0}.\n(2) Let P : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) be the projection onto N(A) with kernel equal to R(A) (see\nRemark 3.4).

Consider F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ) \\ {0} with \u03bd > \u03b8 and let us show the square function estimate\n(S F ) for A. Recall from Remark 6.6 that kxkF = 0 if x \u2208 N(A). Hence according to Remark\n3.4, we may assume that A has dense range. For any z \u2208 \u03a3\u03bd , we let\nF z (t) = F (tz),\n\nt > 0.\n\nClearly each F z is both bounded and integrable on \u03a90 . The starting point of the proof is the\nfollowing construction extracted from [21]. Let \u03c8 : R \u2192 R be an infinitely many differentiable\nP\n2\nfunction with compact support included in [\u22122, 2] satisfying \u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e \u03c8(s \u2212 k) = 1 for any\ns \u2208 R, and let \u03c8k = \u03c8(* \u2212k) for any integer k. By definition, each \u03c8k has support in\n\u03c0\n[k \u2212 2, k + 2]. Then for any k, j \u2208 Z, let \u03c4jk : [k \u2212 2, k + 2] \u2192 C be defined by \u03c4jk (s) = 21 e 2 ijs .\nIt is proved in [21, Lemma 6.5] that\nX\nX\ncz \u03c8k , \u03c4jk < \u221e.\nF\nsup\ne\nk\n\nz\u2208\u03a3\u03b8\n\nj\n\nSince (\u03c4jk )j is an orthonormal basis of L2 ([k \u2212 2, k + 2]; dt) for any k \u2208 Z, then we have\n1\nkabe k2L2 (R;dt)\n2\u03c0\n1 X\nkabe \u03c8k k2L2 ([k\u22122,k+2];dt)\n=\n2\u03c0 k\n1 X\n2\n=\nabe \u03c8k , \u03c4jk\n2\u03c0 j,k\n\nkak2L2 (\u03a90 ) = kae k2L2 (R;dt) =\n\nfor any a \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 ).

Hence averaging over all possible\nj \u03b5j hj (A)x\nchoices of \u03b5j = \u00b11, we obtain that\nN\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b5j hj (A)x\n\nRad(Lp (M))\n\n\u2264 K1 kxk,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n\u0001\nBy Corollary 2.12 and (2.34), this shows that for every x \u2208 Lp (M), the sequence hj (A)x j\u22651\nbelongs to Lp (M; l2rad ) and that\n\u0001\n(7.6)\nhj (A)x j\u22651\n\u2264 K2 kxkLp (M) ,\n2\nLp (M;lrad )\n\nfor some constant K2 > 0 not depending on x.\n\nAccording to\u0001 (7.3), we consider the linear isometry V : L2 (\u03a90 ) \u2192 l2 defined by letting\nV (a) = ha, bj i j\u22651 for any a \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 ). Its adjoint V \u2217 : l2 \u2192 L2 (\u03a90 ) is a contraction, hence\nILp \u2297 V \u2217 extends to a contraction\nVc\u2217 : Lp (M; l2rad ) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )rad )\n\nby Lemma 2.4. Let us show that for any x \u2208 D(A) \u2229 R(A), we have\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n(7.7)\nVc\u2217 hj (A)x j = F (* A)x.\n\nz\n\u2032\nRecall from Section 3 that with g(z) = (1+z)\n2 , we may write x = g(A)x for some (unique)\nx\u2032 \u2208 Lp (M). Moreover by the first two parts of Lemma 6.5, we have\nZ \u221e\ndt\nkF (tA)g(A)k2\n< \u221e.\nt\n0\n\n\f64\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nHence F (* A)g(A)bj (* ) is integrable on \u03a90 for any j \u2265 1. Then using Fubini's Theorem, it is\neasy to deduce from (7.5) that\nZ \u221e\ndt\nhj (A)g(A) =\nF (tA)g(A) bj (t) .\nt\n0\n\u2032\n\nNow let y \u2208 Lp (M) be an arbitrary functional on Lp (M). We see from above that\nhF (* A)x, yi = hF (* A)g(A)x\u2032, yi \u2208 L2 (\u03a90 )\nand that\nhhj (A)x, yi =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nhF (tA)x, yi bj (t)\n\ndt\n,\nt\n\nj \u2265 1.\n\u0001\nThus V maps the function hF (* A)x, yi to the sequence hhj (A)x, yi j\u22651 . Since V is an\n\u0001\nisometry, this implies that conversely, V \u2217 maps the sequence hhj (A)x, yi j\u22651 to the function\n\u2032\nhF (* A)x, yi. Since this holds for any y \u2208 Lp (M), this concludes the proof of (7.7). Owing\nto (7.6), this implies that\n0\n\nkxkF \u2264 K2 kxk,\n\nx \u2208 D(A) \u2229 R(A).\n\nWe now appeal to the approximating sequence (gn )n\u22651 defined by (3.10). For any x \u2208 Lp (M)\nand any n \u2265 1, gn (A)x belongs to D(A) \u2229 R(A), hence kgn (A)xkF \u2264 K2 kgn (A)xk. Since\n(gn (A))n\u22651 is bounded, this shows that for an appropriate constant K3 > 0, we have\nkgn (A)xkF \u2264 K3 kxk,\n\nn \u2265 1, x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nArguing as at the end of the proof of Theorem 6.7, we deduce that kxkF \u2264 K3 kxk for any\nx \u2208 Lp (M). This concludes the proof that A satisfies (S F ). Applying this result for A\u2217 , we\nobtain that A satisfies (S \u2217G ) as well.\nWe now turn to the second assertion. Since A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus, A is Rad-sectoriel of Rad-type \u03b8 by Theorem 4.11. Thus Theorem 6.7 ensures that\nk kF1 and k kF2 are equivalent for any two functions F1 , F2 \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8+ ) \\ {0}. It therefore\nsuffices to prove the result for a particular function F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8+ ). Furthermore, it clearly\nfollows from the first part of this proof that we only need to show that k kF dominates the\noriginal norm on R(A). We fix numbers 0 < \u03c9 < \u03b8 < \u03b4 < \u03b1 < 2\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 < \u03bd < \u03c0 and we\nrecall from [21, Example 4.7] that there exist F, G \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b4 ) such that the product function\ne satisfies (7.1). By the first part of this proof, A satisfies (S \u2217 ) hence applying\n\u03c6 = GF\nG\nProposition 7.2, we find some constant K > 0 such that kf (A)xk \u2264 KkxkF kf k\u221e,\u03bd for any\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ). Let us apply this estimate with f = gn . Since (gn )n\u22651 is a bounded sequence\nof H \u221e (\u03a3\u03bd ), we obtain an estimate\nkgn (A)xk \u2264 K \u2032 kxkF ,\n\nn \u2265 1, x \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nNow assume that x \u2208 R(A). Then gn (A)x converges to x (see Lemma 3.2). This yields\nkxk \u2264 K \u2032 kxkF and completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f65\n\nIf A has dense range and has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus, the above theorem\nyields an equivalence\nkxk \u224d kxkF ,\nx \u2208 Lp (M),\nfor any F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8+ ) \\ {0}.\nThis may be obviously combined with either Proposition 6.2 or Proposition 6.3. The\nresulting formula is easy to be written down when p \u2265 2 and we give it explicitly in the next\nstatement. The case when p < 2 is more involved and its statement is left to the reader. We\nwill come back to this case in Corollary 7.10 below.\nCorollary 7.7.

Indeed if [x]F is finite, and if we\nhave a decomposition x = x1 + x2 with kx1 kF,c < \u221e and kx2 kF,r < \u221e, then we have\nF (* A)x = u1 + u2 , with u1 = F (* A)x1 and u2 = F (* A)x2 , and these functions belong\nto Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )c ) and Lp (M; L2 (\u03a90 )r ) respectively. We do not know if the two square\nfunctions k kF and [ ]F are equivalent in general. In the next statement we give a sufficient\ncondition for such an equivalence to hold true.\nTheorem 7.8. Let A be a sectorial operator on Lp (M), with 1 < p < 2. Let \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and\nassume that A is both Col-sectorial of Col-type \u03c9 and Row-sectorial of Row-type \u03c9.

Indeed, there is a constant C \u2265 1 such that\nwhenever x \u2208 Lp (M) satisfies kxkF < \u221e, then there exist x1 , x2 \u2208 Lp (M) such that\nx = x1 + x2\n\nand\n\nkx1 kF,c + kx2 kF,r \u2264 CkxkF .\n\nProof. We may assume that A has dense range. We will use the function g defined by (3.11).\nThe assumptions imply that A is Rad-sectorial of Rad-type \u03c9. Thus all square functions\nk kF are pairwise equivalent, by Theorem 6.7. Hence it suffices to prove the result for a\nparticular function F \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8+ ).

Various examples of multipliers.\n8.A. Left and right multiplication operators.\nLet (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra acting on some Hilbert space H, and let\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e. For any a \u2208 M, we define a bounded operator La : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) by letting\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nLa (x) = ax,\n\n(8.1)\n\nWe will call La the left multiplication by a on Lp (M). We aim at extending this definition\nto unbounded operators.\nThus we let a : D(a) \u2282 H \u2192 H be a closed and densely defined operator on H. We assume\nthat \u03c1(a) 6= \u2205 and that a is affiliated with M. This means that au = ua for any unitary u\nin the commutant M\u2032 \u2282 B(H). For any z \u2208 \u03c1(a), this implies that (z \u2212 a)u = u(z \u2212 a), and\nhence R(z, a)u = uR(z, a) for any unitary u \u2208 M\u2032 . Thus we have\nR(z, a) \u2208 M,\n\n(8.2)\n\nz \u2208 \u03c1(a).\n\nWe will not use (8.1) directly to define La , because multiplying an unbounded operator a\nwith some x \u2208 Lp (M) leads to technical difficulties. Instead we will use left multiplications\nby resolvents, see (8.3).\nLemma 8.1. Let c \u2208 M \u2282 B(H) be a one-one operator, and let x \u2208 Lp (M). If cx = 0,\nthen x = 0.\nProof. This is clear by regarding x and cx as unbounded operators on H in the usual way.\nIndeed if \u03b6 belongs to the domain of x, then we have cx(\u03b6) = 0. Hence x(\u03b6) = 0.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.2. Let (bt )t \u2282 M be any bounded net converging to 0 in the strong operator\ntopology of B(H). Then kbt xkp \u2192 0 for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and any x \u2208 Lp (M).\nProof. We start with p = 2. Let x \u2208 L2 (M). Then xx\u2217 \u2208 L1 (M) \u2243 M\u2217 and we have\n\u0001\nkbt xk22 = \u03c4 (bt x)\u2217 (bt x) = \u03c4 (b\u2217t bt xx\u2217 ) = hb\u2217t bt , xx\u2217 iM,M\u2217 .\n\nBy Hahn-Banach, xx\u2217 : M \u2192 C extends to some w \u2217 -continuous functional on B(H), and\nhence there exist two sequences (\u03b6k )k\u22651 and (\u03bek )k\u22651 belonging to l2 (H) such that\n\u221e\nX\n\u2217\nhw(\u03b6k ), \u03bek i,\nw \u2208 M.\nhw, xx iM,M\u2217 =\nk=1\n\nThus we obtain that\nkbt xk22\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\nhbt (\u03b6k ), bt (\u03bek )i \u2264\n\n\u221e\n\u0010X\nk=1\n\nkbt (\u03b6k )k\n\n2\n\n\u221e\n\u0011 21 \u0010X\nk=1\n\nkbt (\u03bek )k\n\n2\n\n\u0011 21\n\n.\n\nSince bt \u2192 0 strongly and (bt )t is bounded, we deduce that kbt xk2 \u2192 0.\nAssume now that p > 2 and take x \u2208 M \u2229 L2 (M). We let \u03b1 = p2 , so that we have\n[L\u221e (M), L2 (M)]\u03b1 = Lp (M) by (2.4). This implies that\nkbt xkp \u2264 kbt xk\u03b12 kbt xk1\u2212\u03b1\n\u221e .\n\n\f70\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nWe know from the first part of this proof that kbt xk2 \u2192 0. Since (bt )t is bounded, we\ndeduce that kbt xkp \u2192 0. Using again the boundedness of (bt )t , together with the density of\nM \u2229 L2 (M) in Lp (M), we obtain that kbt xkp \u2192 0 for any x \u2208 Lp (M).\nFinally we assume that 1 \u2264 p < 2, and we let x \u2208 Lp (M). By the converse of the\nnoncommutative H\u00f6lder inequality (see paragraph 2.A), there exist x\u2032 , x\u2032\u2032 in L2p (M) such\nthat x = x\u2032 x\u2032\u2032 . Then we have kbt xkp \u2264 kbt x\u2032 k2p kx\u2032\u2032 k2p . However kbt x\u2032 k2p \u2192 0 by the above\nparagraph, hence we obtain that kbt xkp \u2192 0\n\u0003\nLemma 8.3. For any z \u2208 \u03c1(a), the left multiplication LR(z,a) : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) is one-one\nand has dense range.\n\u2032\n\nProof. That LR(z,a) is one-one follows from Lemma 8.1. Next let y \u2208 Lp (M) be orthogonal\nto the range of LR(z,a) . Then\n\u0001\n\u0001\n0 = \u03c4 R(z, a)xy = \u03c4 xyR(z, a)\nfor any x \u2208 Lp (M), hence yR(z, a) = 0. Thus R(z, a)\u2217 y \u2217 = 0 and by Lemma 8.1, we deduce\nthat y = 0. This shows that LR(z,a) has dense range.\n\u0003\nLet z \u2208 \u03c1(a). According to Lemma 8.3, we may consider the inverse of LR(z,a) , with\ndomain D equal to the range of LR(z,a) . Then we define\n(8.3)\n\np\nLa := z \u2212 L\u22121\nR(z,a) : D \u2212\u2192 L (M).\n\nClearly La is a closed and densely defined operator. Using the resolvent equation\nR(z1 , a) \u2212 R(z2 , a) = (z2 \u2212 z1 )R(z1 , a)R(z2 , a),\nit is easy to see that this definition does not depend on z. Moreover \u03c1(a) \u2282 \u03c1(La ) and\n(8.4)\n\nR(z, La ) = LR(z,a) ,\n\nz \u2208 \u03c1(a).\n\nDetails are left to the reader.\nWe now consider the specific case of sectorial operators.\nProposition 8.4.\n(1) Assume that a : D(a) \u2192 H is a sectorial operator of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), which is affiliated\nwith M. Then La is sectorial of type \u03c9 on Lp (M). Moreover \u03c1(a) \u2282 \u03c1(La ) and for\nany z \u2208 \u03c1(a) and any x \u2208 Lp (M), we have R(z, La )(x) = R(z, a)x.\n(2) For any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03c9+ ), we have\n(8.5)\n\nf (La )(x) = f (a)x,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\n(3) Let \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0) be an angle. Then La has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if\nand only if a has one. In that case, La actually has a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus.\n(4) If a has dense range, then La has dense range. If further a admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus, then (8.5) holds true for any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\n\f71\n\nProof. Part (1) clearly follows from (8.4). Next (2) follows (1) and (3.5), and (3) is a\nstraightforward consequence of (2).\nLet us turn to (4). We let A = La . We assume that a has dense range. According to [21,\nTheorem 3.8], a(t + a)\u22121 \u2192 IH strongly when t \u2192 0+ . Moreover the net (a(t + a)\u22121 )t>0 is\nbounded by sectoriality. Hence for any x \u2208 Lp (M), ka(t+a)\u22121 x\u2212xkp \u2192 0 when t \u2192 0+ , by\nLemma 8.2. Using (1), we note that a(t + a)\u22121 x = A(t + A)\u22121 (x). Consequently, a(t + a)\u22121 x\nbelongs to R(A) for any t > 0. Thus R(A) is a dense subspace of Lp (M).\nAssume moreover that a admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus and consider any\nf \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). Let x \u2208 Lp (M), and let g be defined by (3.11). Applying (2) twice, we see\nthat\ng(a)f (a)x = g(A)(f (A)(x)) = g(a)[f (A)(x)].\nSince g(a) in one-one, the identity f (A)(x) = f (a)x now follows from Lemma 8.1.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext we discuss left multiplications by c0 -semigroups.\nProposition 8.5.\n(1) Let (wt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on H, with negative generator a, and assume\nthat wt \u2208 M for each t \u2265 0. Then a is affiliated with M.\n(2) For any t \u2265 0 and x \u2208 Lp (M), we define Tt (x) = wt x. Then (Tt )t\u22650 is a bounded\nc0 -semigroup on Lp (M), with negative generator equal to La .\nProof. According to the Laplace formula (3.2), we have\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\n(1 + a) (\u03b6) =\ne\u2212t wt (\u03b6) dt ,\n0\n\n\u03b6 \u2208 H.\n\nSince M \u2282 B(H) is strongly closed, this implies that (1 + a)\u22121 \u2208 M. That a is affiliated\nwith M follows at once.\nIt is clear that (Tt )t\u22650 is a bounded semigroup. Since (wt )t\u22650 is bounded and strongly\ncontinuous, Lemma 8.2 ensures that (Tt )t\u22650 also is strongly continuous.\nLet A be the negative generator of (Tt )t\u22650 . To show that A = La , it suffices to check that\n(1 + A)\u22121 = L(1+a)\u22121 , by (8.4). We use the Laplace formula again. Let p\u2032 be the conjugate\n\u2032\nnumber of p. For x \u2208 Lp (M) and y \u2208 Lp (M), we have\nZ \u221e\nDZ \u221e\nE\n\u22121\n\u2212t\n(1 + A) (x), yiLp ,Lp\u2032 =\ne Tt (x) dt , y\n=\ne\u2212t \u03c4 (wt xy) dt .\n\u2032\nLp ,Lp\n\n0\n\n0\n\nArguing as in Lemma 8.2, we may find two sequences (\u03b6k )k\u22651 and (\u03bek )k\u22651 belonging to l2 (H)\nsuch that\n\u221e\nX\nhw(\u03b6k ), \u03bek i,\nw \u2208 M.\n\u03c4 (wxy) =\nk=1\n\n\f72\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThus we obtain that\n\u22121\n\n(1 + A) (x), yiLp ,Lp\u2032 =\n=\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ne\u2212t\n\n0\n\n\u221e DZ\nX\nk=1\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\n\u221e\n\nhwt (\u03b6k ), \u03bek i dt\n\ne\u2212t wt (\u03b6k ) dt , \u03bek\n\n0\n\nE\n\n(1 + a)\u22121 (\u03b6k ), \u03bek\n\nk=1\n\n= \u03c4 ((1 + a)\u22121 xy)\n= h(1 + a)\u22121 x, yiLp ,Lp\u2032 .\nThis proves the desired identity.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 8.6. In order to apply Proposition 8.4 (3), one needs to know which sectorial\noperators on Hilbert space have a bounded H \u221e functional calculus. This question was\ninitiated in McIntosh's fundamental paper on H \u221e calculus [54]. We refer to [55], [3, Lecture\n3], [5], and [46] for various results on this topic. Let (wt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on\nH, with negative generator a. We recall that if (wt )t\u22650 is a contraction semigroup, then a\nhas a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 . Furthermore, if a is sectorial of\ntype \u03c9 < \u03c02 , then for any \u03b8 > \u03c9, a has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus if and only if\n(wt )t\u22650 is similar to a contraction semigroup [46].\nRemark 8.7.\n(1) Let a : D(a) \u2282 H \u2192 H be a closed and densely defined operator affiliated with M,\nand assume that \u03c1(a) 6= \u2205. In (8.3) or (8.4) we defined the left multiplication by a on Lp (M).\nBy symmetry, one can clearly define the right multiplication by a on Lp (M); we denote this\noperator by Ra . Namely, if a is bounded, we let Ra (x) = xa for any x \u2208 Lp (M). Then if a\nis unbounded, we argue as in the 'left case' and for any z \u2208 \u03c1(a), the operator Ra is defined\nas z \u2212 R\u22121\nR(z,a) . Equivalently, we have R(z, Ra ) = RR(z,a) . It is clear that Propositions 8.4\nand 8.5 extend verbatim to right multiplications.\n(2) If 1 < p, p\u2032 < \u221e are two conjugate numbers, then the adjoint of the left multiplication\n\u2032\nby a on Lp (M) coincides with the right multiplication by a on Lp (M). Indeed if a is\nbounded, we have\nhax, yi = \u03c4 (axy) = \u03c4 (xya) = hx, yai,\n\n\u2032\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M), y \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nThen the general case follows from the bounded one, by using resolvents.\nBy a similar calculation, one has L\u25e6a = Ra\u2217 and R\u25e6a = La\u2217 (using the notation introduced\nin (2.5)). By (2.6) we deduce that if p = 2, we have\nL\u2020a = La\u2217\n\nand\n\nR\u2020a = Ra\u2217 .\n\nThus La (resp. Ra ) is selfadjoint on L2 (M) if and only if a is selfadjoint.\n\n\f73\n\n(3) We recall that two (possibly unbounded) operators A and B with non empty resolvent\nsets are called commuting if for any z1 \u2208 \u03c1(A) and z2 \u2208 \u03c1(B), we have\nR(z1 , A)R(z2 , B) = R(z2 , B)R(z1 , A).\nIt is clear that if a, b are two sectotial operators on H affiliated with M, then the operators\nA = La and B = Rb on Lp (M) commute in the above sense.\nLeft and right multiplications were used in the early days of H \u221e functional calculus to\nprovide some examples involving pairs of commuting operators. Assume that p 6= 2, and\nconsider the case when M is equal to B(l2 ) equipped with the usual trace. It was shown\nin [45] that there may exist positive selfadjoint operators a and b on l2 such that the pair\n(La , Rb ) does not have a bounded joint functional calculus on S p (see the latter paper for a\ndefinition), although La and Rb each admit a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any\n\u03b8 > 0. On the other hand it follows from [55] and [42, Theorem 6.3] that there may exist a\npositive selfadjoint operator a on H such that the operator La on S 1 is not Rad-sectorial.\n8.B. Hamiltonians.\nIn this part we wish to consider a special class of quantum dynamical semigroups and their\nextensions to noncommutative Lp -spaces. For that purpose, we will need a few facts about\nbisectorial operators on general Banach spaces, their functional calculus, and relationships\nwith sectorial operators. For any \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ), we let\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nS \u03c9 = {z \u2208 C\u2217 : \u2212 \u03c9 < |Arg(z)| < + \u03c9}\n2\n2\nbe the open cone of angle 2\u03c9 around the imaginary axis iR. Then we let H \u221e (S \u03c9 ) be the\nalgebra of all bounded analytic functions on S \u03c9 equipped with the supremum norm, and we\nlet H0\u221e (S \u03c9 ) be the subalgebra of all f for which there exists s > 0 such that |f (z)| = O(|z|\u2212s )\nas |z| \u2192 \u221e for z \u2208 S \u03c9 , and |f (z)| = O(|z|s ) as |z| \u2192 0 for z \u2208 S \u03c9 . We say that a closed and\ndensely defined operator B on some Banach space X is bisectorial of type \u03c9 if its spectrum\nis contained in the closure of S \u03c9 , and if for any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c02 ), zR(z, B) is uniformly bounded\noutside S \u03b8 . This is the same as saying that B and \u2212B are both sectorial of type \u03c9 + \u03c02 .\nAssume that \u03c9 + \u03c02 < \u03b3 < \u03b8 + \u03c02 , and let g \u2208 H0\u221e (S \u03b8 ). By analogy with (3.5), we define\nZ\n1\ng(z)R(z, B) + g(\u2212z)R(z, \u2212B) dz .\n(8.6)\ng(B) =\n2\u03c0i \u0393\u03b3\nAs in the sectorial case, this definition does not depend on \u03b3, and g 7\u2192 g(B) is an algebra\nhomomorphism which is consistent with the functional calculus of rational functions. We\nsay that B is bisectorial of type 0 if it is bisectorial of type \u03c9 for any \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ).\nFor any 0 < \u03c9 < \u03c02 , the transformation z 7\u2192 \u2212z 2 maps S \u03c9 onto \u03a32\u03c9 . It is not hard to\nshow that if B is bisectorial of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ), then \u2212B 2 is a sectorial operator of type 2\u03c9.\nFurthermore, the functional calculi of B and \u2212B 2 are compatible in the following sense. Let\n\u03b8 \u2208 (2\u03c9, \u03c0) and let f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). Then the function g : S \u03b8/2 \u2192 C defined by g(z) = f (\u2212z 2 )\n\n\f74\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nbelongs to H0\u221e (S \u03b8/2 ), and we have g(B) = f (\u2212B 2 ). This follows from (8.6) and (3.5), details\nare left to the reader.\nWe will apply the above construction to generators of bounded groups. Let X be a Banach\nspace and let (Ut )t\u2208R be a bounded c0 -group on X. We let iA denote its infinitesimal\ngenerator. It is clearly bisectorial of type 0, hence A2 is a sectorial operator of type 0.

We already noticed\n\u221a that A is sectorial of type 0.\u221aFormula (8.9) follows by applying\n(8.8) with A replaced by 2tA, and then changing s into 2 s in the resulting integral. Since\nR s2\n\u221a\n2\neach Ust 12 is a contraction and e\u2212 4 ds = 2 \u03c0, we deduce that ke\u2212tA k \u2264 1.\n\u0003\n\nWe give another general result which will be used later on in this section.\n\nLemma 8.9. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a bounded c0 -semigroup on X, and let \u2212C denote its generator.\nWe let\n1\n1 e\u2212 4s\nh(s) = \u221a\nfor any s > 0.\n2 \u03c0 s 23\nThen we have\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212tC 2\n=\nt \u2265 0.\nh(s) Tst2 ds ,\n(8.10)\ne\n0\n\n1\n\nIf (Tt )t\u22650 is a contractive semigroup, then ke\u2212tC 2 k \u2264 1 for any t \u2265 0.\nProof. Formula (8.10) is well-known, see e.g. [22, Ex. 2.32]. Indeed Ra proof of (8.10) can be\n\u221e\nobtained by a computation similar to the one given for (8.8). Since 0 h(s) ds = 1, the last\nassertion is clear from (8.10).\n\u0003\nWe will now apply the above results to a special class of quantum dynamical groups and\ntheir generators (see e.g. [59, III. 30]). Let (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra,\nand let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e be any number. Let a and b be two selfadjoint operators affiliated with\nM. If they are both bounded, we define an operator Ad(a,b) : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) by\nAd(a,b) (x) = ax \u2212 xb,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nWe will extend this definition to the case when a or b is unbounded. Let A = La and B = Rb\nbe the left and right multiplications on Lp (M) by a and b respectively (see paragraph 8.A).\nWe claim that the intersection D(A) \u2229 D(B) is a dense subspace of Lp (M), and that the\ndifference operator\nA \u2212 B : D(A) \u2229 D(B) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)\n\n\f76\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\ntaking x to A(x) \u2212 B(x) is closable. To prove the density assertion, note that for any\nx \u2208 Lp (M), we have\ninR(in, A)(x) = inR(in, a)x \u2212\u2192 x\nwhen n \u2192 \u221e. Indeed this follows from (8.4) and Lemma 8.2. Likewise, inR(in, B)(x) \u2192 x\nwhen n \u2192 \u221e. We deduce that n2 R(in, B) R(in, A)(x) \u2192 \u2212x when n \u2192 \u221e. Since R(in, B)\nand R(in, A) commute for any n \u2265 1, each element n2 R(in, B) R(in, A)(x) belongs to the\nsubspace D(A) \u2229 D(B). Hence x is the limit of a sequence of D(A) \u2229 D(B).\nTo prove the closability of A \u2212 B, suppose that (xn )n\u22651 is a sequence of D(A) \u2229 D(B)\nconverging to 0, such that A(xn ) \u2212 B(xn ) converges to some x \u2208 Lp (M). The resolvent\noperators R(i, A) and R(i, B) commute, hence\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR(i, A)R(i, B)(A \u2212 B) = R(i, B) AR(i, A) \u2212 R(i, A) BR(i, B)\non D(A) \u2229 D(B). Thus\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR(i, A)R(i, B)(x) = lim R(i, B) AR(i, A) (xn ) \u2212 lim R(i, A) BR(i, B) (xn ) = 0.\nn\n\nn\n\nSince R(i, A)R(i, B) is one-one, this shows that x = 0. Hence A \u2212 B is closable.\nWe can now define Ad(a,b) as the closure of A \u2212 B, that is,\nAd(a,b) = La \u2212 Rb .\n\n(8.11)\n\nLemma 8.10. Let a and b be selfadjoint operators affiliated with M, and let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nFor any t \u2208 R, we define Ut : Lp (M) \u2192 Lp (M) by\nUt (x) = eita xe\u2212itb ,\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M).\n\nThen (Ut )t\u2208R is a c0 -group of isometries on Lp (M), with generator equal to iAd(a,b) .\nProof. For any t \u2208 R, we define\n\nTt : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)\n\nand\n\nSt : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)\n\nby letting Tt (x) = eita x and St (x) = xe\u2212itb for any x \u2208 Lp (M). According to Proposition 8.5\nand its 'right' version, (Tt )t\u2208R and (St )t\u2208R are both c0 -groups of isometries on Lp (M), with\ngenerators equal to iLa and \u2212iRb respectively. These two c0 -groups are commuting (that is,\nSs Tt = Tt Ss for any s, t), and Ut = St Tt is defined as their product. Then it is easy to check\nthat (Ut )t\u2208R is a c0 -group of isometries. By e.g. [57, p. 24], its generator is the closure of\nthe sum of the generators of (Tt )t and (St )t . By (8.11), this operator is iAd(a,b) .\n\u0003\nRemark 8.11. Let a, b and (Ut )t be as in Lemma 8.10 above. Let e\na = I\u2297a be the closure\n2\ne\nof Il2 \u2297 a on the Hilbertian tensor product l \u22972 H, and let b be defined similarly. These are\nselfadjoint operators affiliated with B(l2 )\u2297M. Then it is clear that (Ut )t is a completely\nisometric c0 -group, with\ne\n\nI\u2297Ut (y) = eitea ye\u2212itb ,\n\nt \u2208 R, y \u2208 S p [Lp (M)].\n\nBy Lemma 3.9, iI\u2297Ad(a,b) = iAd(ea,eb) is the generator of (I\u2297Ut )t .\n\n\f77\n\nTheorem 8.12. Consider two finite commuting families (a1 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , . . . , bn ) of selfadjoint operators affiliated with M. (Namely we asssume that ai aj = aj ai and bi bj = bj bi\nfor any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, but we do not assume that ai commutes with bj .) We assume that\n1 < p < \u221e, and for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, we let Aj = Ad(aj ,bj ) be defined by (8.11) on Lp (M).\n(1) The sum operator\nn\n\\\n\u0001\n2\n2\nD A2j \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)\nC = A1 + * * * + An :\nj=1\n\nis closed and densely defined, and \u2212C generates a completely contractive semigroup\non the space Lp (M).\n(2) Furthermore for any \u03b8 > 0, C admits a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus on Lp (M).\n\nProof. It follows from Corollary 8.8 and Lemma 8.10 that for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, A2j is a sectorial\noperator of type 0 and that \u2212A2j generates a contractive semigroup (Ttj )t\u22650 on Lp (M). Since\nLp (M) is UMD, it also follows from [32, Section 4] that A2j admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus for any \u03b8 > 0.\nNext the sectorial operators A21 , . . . , A2n are pairwise commuting, in the sense of Remark\n8.7 (3). Indeed A1 , . . . , An are pairwise commuting, by our hypothesis that both families\n(a1 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , . . . , bn ) are commuting.\nSince Lp (M) is UMD, we deduce by [42, Proposition 3.2] and [48, Theorem 1.1] that the\nsum operator C = A21 +. . .+A2n is a sectorial operator of type 0 (in particular, it is closed and\ndensely defined), and that C admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > 0.\nFurther if we let\nTt = Tt1 * * * Ttn : Lp (M) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M)\nfor any t \u2265 0, then (Tt )t\u22650 is a c0 -semigroup of contractions. By [57, p. 24], its generator is\n\u2212C. This proves the 'bounded' version of the theorem.\nTo prove the 'completely bounded' version, we let aej = I\u2297aj and bej = I\u2297bj be the closures\nof Il2 \u2297 aj and Il2 \u2297 bj on l2 \u22972 H respectively. According to Remark 8.11, Ad(aej ,aej ) = I\u2297Aj .\nMoreover (ae1 , . . . , aen ) and (be1 , . . . , ben ) are commuting families. Hence applying the first part\nof this proof to these families, we obtain that I\u2297C generates a contractive semigroup and\nadmits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.13.\n(1) Consider (a1 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , . . . , bn ) as in Theorem 8.12 above. Suppose that p = 2,\nand let Tt = e\u2212tC be the semigroup generated by \u2212C on L2 (M). It is clear that A2j is\nselfadjoint for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Indeed this follows either from Remark 8.7 (2), or from the\nfact that the generator of a group of isometries on Hilbert space is necessary skewadjoint.\nThis implies that for any t \u2265 0, Tt : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) is selfadjoint. Furthermore applying\nCorollary 8.8 and Lemma 8.10 on X = L1 (M), and arguing as in the proof of Theorem\n8.12 (1), we see that Tt is contractive on L1 (M) for any t \u2265 0. Hence (Tt )t\u22650 is a diffusion\nsemigroup on M (see Remark 5.2).\n\n\f78\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nLater on in this section, we will consider the square root operator\n\u00011\n1\n(8.12)\nA = C 2 = A21 + * * * + A2n 2 .\n\nApplying Lemma 8.9 and the above paragraph, we see that (e\u2212tA )t\u22650 also is a diffusion\nsemigroup on M.\n(2) For a selfadjoint operator a affiliated with M, we let\nAda = Ad(a,a) .\nFor any s \u2208 R, the operator Us : L2 (M) \u2192 L2 (M) taking any x \u2208 L2 (M) to eisa xe\u2212isa is\n2\ncompletely positive. Hence according to Lemma 8.10 and Corollary 8.8, e\u2212tAda is completely\npositive for any t \u2265 0.\nNext we consider a commuting family (a1 , . . . , an ) of selfadjoint operators affiliated with\nM, we let Aj = Adaj for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, and we let C = A21 + * * * + A2n . (In other words, we\nconsider the case when aj = bj in Theorem 8.12 and in (1) above.) Since Tt = e\u2212tC is the\n2\nproduct of the e\u2212tAdaj , we obtain from above that Tt is completely positive for any t \u2265 0.\nLikewise, if A is defined by (8.12), then e\u2212tA is completely positive for any t \u2265 0. Indeed\nthis follows from Lemma 8.9. Thus (e\u2212tC )t\u22650 and (e\u2212tA )t\u22650 are completely positive diffusion\nsemigroups.\n\u00012 \u0001 1\nThese results apply in particular to the case when A = Ada = Ada 2 is the modulus\nof the operator Ada .\nFor a fixed 1 < p < \u221e, let A1 , . . . , An and C be as in Theorem 8.12, and let \u03b8 > 0\nbe a positive angle. The second part of the above theorem says that the homomorphism\n\u03c0 : H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) \u2192 B(Lp (M)) taking f to f (C) is bounded. According to the methods we\nused for this result, the norm of that homomorphism can be dominated by a constant only\ndepending on p, \u03b8, and n, and not on the families (a1 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , . . . , bn ) used to define\nA1 , . . . , An . For some applications (see paragraph 8.C below), the fact that k\u03c0k may depend\non n turns out to be a serious drawback. In the last part of this paragraph, we will show\nthat this norm can be dominated by a constant which does not depend on n, provided that\nwe insist that \u03b8 be large enough. As in Section 5, we let\n\u03c9p = \u03c0\n\n1 1\n\u2212 .\np 2\n\nTheorem 8.14. Let (M, \u03c4 ) be a semifinite von Neumann algebra, let 1 < p < \u221e, and let\n\u03b8 > \u03c9p . There exists a constant K\u03b8,p satisfying the following property:\nIf (a1 , . . . , an ) and (b1 , . . . , bn ) are two commuting families of selfadjoint operators affiliated\n1\nwith M, if Aj = Ad(aj ,bj ) on Lp (M), and if we let A = (A21 + * * * + A2n ) 2 , then\nkf (A)k \u2264 K\u03b8,p kf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\n\f79\n\nProof. We noticed in Remark 8.13 (1) that \u2212A generates a diffusion semigroup on M. Thus\naccording to Proposition 5.8 and the subsequent Remark 5.10, it will suffice to prove the\ntheorem for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 .\nWe write\n1\n1 e\u2212 4s\n1 \u2212 y2\nand\nh(s) = \u221a\nb(y) = \u221a e 4\n2 \u03c0\n2 \u03c0 s 32\nfor the two nonnegative functions appearing in (8.9) and (8.10) respectively.\nLet C = A21 + * * * + A2n be the square of A, and let (Tt )t\u22650 be the c0 -semigroup generated\nby \u2212C. For any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, we let (Utj )t be the c0 -group on Lp (M) generated by iAj . We\nnoticed in the proof of Theorem 8.12 that (Tt )t\u22650 is the product of the semigroups generated\nby the A2j 's. According to (8.9), we obtain that for any t \u2265 0,\n\u0010Z \u221e\n\u0011\n\u0010Z \u221e\n\u0011\n1\nTt =\nb(y1 ) U 1 dy1 * * * * * *\nb(yn ) U n 1 dyn\ny1 t 2\nyn t 2\n\u2212\u221e\nZ \u2212\u221e\n=\nb(y1 ) * * * b(yn ) U 1 1 * * * U n 1 dy1 * * * dyn .\nRn\n\ny1 t 2\n\nyn t 2\n\nApplying Lemma 8.10, we deduce that for any x \u2208 Lp (M),\nZ\nTt (x) =\nb(y1 ) * * * b(yn ) \u00d7\nRn\n\b 1\n\b\n1\nexp it 2 (y1 a1 + * * * + yn an ) x exp \u2212it 2 (y1 b1 + * * * + yn bn ) dy1 * * * dyn .\n\nIf we change t into st2 in the above identity and apply (8.10), we deduce that\nZ\n\u2212tA\ne (x) =\nh(s) b(y1 ) * * * b(yn ) \u00d7\n\b\n\b 1\n1\nexp it s 2 (y1 a1 + * * * + yn an ) x exp \u2212it s 2 (y1 b1 + * * * + yn bn ) ds dy1 * * * dyn ,\n\nthe latter integral being taken on R+ \u00d7 Rn .\nThus e\u2212tA is an average of c0 -groups of isometries on Lp (M). More precisely, for any\n(s, y1 , . . . , yn ) in the set R+ \u00d7 Rn , let B{s, y1 , . . . , yn } denote the operator \u2212iAd(a,b) , where\n1\n1\na = s 2 (y1 a1 + * * * + yn an ) and b = s 2 (y1 b1 + * * * + yn bn ). With this notation, we have\n\b\n\b 1\n1\nexp{\u2212tB{s, y1 , . . . , yn }}(x) = exp it s 2 (y1 a1 + * * *+ yn an ) x exp \u2212it s 2 (y1 b1 + * * *+ yn bn )\n\nfor any x \u2208 Lp (M).

Indeed by the Laplace formula we\ndeduce from above that for any complex number z with Re(z) < 0, we have\nZ\n\u0001\n(8.13)\nR(z, A) =\nh(s) b(y1 ) * * * b(yn ) R z, B{s, y1 , . . . , yn } ds dy1 * * * dyn .\n\n\f80\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThen applying (3.5), we deduce that for any \u03b8 > \u03c02 and any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), we have\nZ\n\u0001\nf (A) =\nh(s) b(y1 ) * * * b(yn ) f B{s, y1 , . . . , yn } ds dy1 * * * dyn .\nAccording to Proposition 3.11 for X = Lp (M), we have an estimate\n\u0001\nf B{s, y1 , . . . , yn } \u2264 K\u03b8,p kf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nfor some uniform constant K\u03b8,p only depending on \u03b8 and p.

Namely there is a constant K\u03b8,p such that if aj , bj and A are in\nthis theorem, then kf (A)kcb \u2264 K\u03b8,p kf k\u221e,\u03b8 for any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\nRemark 8.16.\n(1) Let A1 , . . . , An , C, and A as above. Since C = A2 , it follows from Theorem 8.14 that\nfor any \u03b8 > 2\u03c9p we have\n(8.14)\n\nkf (C)k \u2264 K\u03b8,p kf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n\n(2) Assume that aj = bj for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. In that case, the c0 -semigroup (Tt )t\u22650\ngenerated by \u2212C is completely positive (see Remark 8.13 (2)). Hence C is Rad-sectoriel\nof Rad-type \u03c9p by Theorem 5.6. Therefore combining (8.14) and [42, Proposition 5.1], we\n\u2032\ndeduce that for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p , there is a constant K\u03b8,p\nonly depending on p and \u03b8 such that\n\u2032\n\u221e\nkf (C)k \u2264 K\u03b8,p kf k\u221e,\u03b8 for any f \u2208 H0 (\u03a3\u03b8 ). In turn this implies that\n\u03c9p\n\u2032\nkf (A)k \u2264 K\u03b8,p\nkf k\u221e,\u03b8 ,\n\u03b8 > , f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\n2\n8.C. Schur multipliers on S p .\nLet 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. As usual, we will regard the Schatten space S p as a space of scalar\nvalued infinite matrices, and we let Eij denote the standard matrix units, for i, j \u2265 1. Let\n[aij ]i,j\u22651 be an infinite matrix of complex numbers. By definition, the Schur multiplier on\nS p associated with this matrix is the linear operator A whose domain is the space of all\nx = [xij ] \u2208 S p such that [aij xij ] belongs to S p , and whose action is given by\n\u0002\nA(x) = aij xij ]i,j\u22651,\nx = [xij ]i,j\u22651 \u2208 D(A).\n\nEach Eij belongs to D(A), hence A is densely defined. It is also easy to check that A is\nclosed. Moreover the kernel of A is equal to\nN(A) = Span{Eij : aij = 0}.\n\n\f81\n\nIn particular, A is one-one if aij 6= 0 for any i, j \u2265 1.\nLet z \u2208 C be a complex number. Clearly z \u2208 \u03c1(A) if and only if ai,j 6= z for any i, j \u2265 1\nand if the Schur multiplier associated with the matrix [(z \u2212 aij )\u22121 ] is bounded. In that case,\nR(z, A) coincides with that Schur multiplier.\n\u25e6\n\nFor any \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) and any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), it will be convenient to let f : \u03a3\u03b8 \u222a {0} \u2192 C\n\u25e6\n\ndenote the prolongation of f obtained by letting f (0) = 0.\nUsing (3.5), we deduce from above that if A is sectorial of type \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), then aij \u2208 \u03a3\u03c9\n\u25e6\n\nfor any i, j \u2265 1, and f (A) is the Schur multiplier associated with the matrix [f (aij )] for any\nf \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c9, \u03c0).\np\nFurthermore, \u2212A generates a bounded\n\u0002 \u2212ta c\u00030 -semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 on S if and only if the Schur\nmultipliers associated to the matrix e ij are uniformly bounded. In that case, Tt is indeed\nthe Schur multiplier associated to the latter matrix.\nThe main result of this paragraph is the following.\nProposition 8.17. Let H be a real Hilbert space, and let (\u03b1k )k\u22651 and (\u03b2k )k\u22651 be two sequences of H. In the next statements, k * k denotes the norm on H.\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(1) For any 1 < p < \u221e, the Schur multiplier on S p associated with k\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b2j k is cbsectorial of type \u03c9p = \u03c0| 21 \u2212 p1 | and admits a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional\ncalculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p .\n(2) For any 1 < p < \u221e, for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p , and for any f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), the Schur multiplier\n\u0002\u25e6\n\u0001\u0003\nassociated with f k\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b2j k is completely bounded\u0002 on S p .\n\u0003\n(3) For any t \u2265 0, the Schur product Tt associated with e\u2212t(k\u03b1i \u2212\u03b2j k) is completely contractive on S p for any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, and (Tt )t\u22650 is a diffusion semigroup on B(l2 ).\nWe will need the following approximation lemma. Its proof is elementary, using the facts\ngiven before Proposition 8.17. We leave it as an exercice for the reader.\nLemma 8.18. Let 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e and let \u03c9 \u2208 (0, \u03c0) be an angle. For any i, j \u2265 1, let (anij )n\u22651\nbe a sequence of \u03a3\u03c9 , which admits a limit aij when n \u2192 \u221e. Let Bn (resp. A) be the Schur\nmultiplier on S p associated with [anij ] (resp. with [aij ]).\n(1) Assume that \u03c3(Bn ) \u2282 \u03a3\u03c9 for any n \u2265 1 and assume that for any \u03b8 > \u03c9, there is a\nconstant K\u03b8 > 0 such that kzR(z, Bn )k \u2264 K\u03b8 for any z \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 and any n \u2265 1.\nThen A is sectorial of type \u03c9.\n(2) Assume further that for some \u03b8 > \u03c9, there is a constant K > 0 such that kf (Bn )k \u2264\nKkf k\u221e,\u03b8 for any f \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and any n \u2265 1. Then A has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus.\n(3) Assume that \u2212Bn generates a bounded c0 -semigroup (Ttn )t\u22650 for any n \u2265 0, and that\nthere is a constant C \u2265 1 such that kTtn k \u2264 C for any t \u2265 0 and any n \u2265 1. Then\n\u2212A generates a bounded c0 -semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 , and kTt k \u2264 C for any t \u2265 0.\n\nProof. (of Proposition 8.17.) We fix some 1 < p < \u221e. Throughout this proof we let\naij = k\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b2j k, and we let A be the Schur multiplier on S p associated with the matrix\n\n\f82\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n[aij ]i,j\u22651. Replacing H by the closed linear span of the \u03b1i 's and \u03b2j 's if necessary, we may\nasssume that H is separable. Let (ek )k\u22651 be an orthonormal basis of H. For any k \u2265 1, we\nlet\n\u03b1ik = h\u03b1i , ek i\nand\n\u03b2jk = h\u03b2j , ek i .\nThen for any i, j \u2265 1, we have\naij =\n\nlim anij ,\nn\n\nwith\n\nanij\n\n=\n\n\u0012X\nn\nk=1\n\n\u03b1ik \u2212 \u03b2jk\n\n2\n\n\u0013 21\n\n.\n\nAll numbers \u03b1ik and \u03b2jk are real, hence we may define selfadjoint operators ak and bk on l2\nwith diagonal matrices equal to Diag{\u03b1ik : i \u2265 1} and Diag{\u03b2jk : j \u2265 1} respectively. Let\nAk be the Schur multiplier associated to the matrix [\u03b1ik \u2212 \u03b2jk ]. Then\n\u0001\nAk (Eij ) = \u03b1ik \u2212 \u03b2jk Eij = ak Eij \u2212 Eij bk\nfor any i, j \u2265 1. Hence Ak = Ad(ak ,bk ) in the notation of paragraph 8.B. For any integer\nn \u2265 1, we let\n\u00011\nBn = A21 + * * * + A2n 2 .\n\nThus Bn is the Schur multiplier associated with the matrix [anij ].\nWe fix some \u03b8 > \u03c9p . Then for any \u03bb \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 , we let\n\n\u03bb\n1\n\u2212\n.\n1+z\n\u03bb\u2212z\nLet \u03b8\u2032 = (\u03c9p + \u03b8)/2 and note that f\u03bb belongs to H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8\u2032 ), with sup\u03bb kf\u03bb k\u221e,\u03b8\u2032 < \u221e. Hence\nby Theorem 8.14 (applied with \u03b8\u2032 ), there is a constant K\u03b8 not depending either on \u03bb or n\nsuch that kf\u03bb (Bn )k \u2264 K\u03b8 .\nOn the other hand, by Theorem 8.12 and Lemma 8.10, \u2212Bn generates a contraction\nsemigroup on S p . Hence k(1 + Bn )\u22121 k \u2264 1 for any n \u2265 1, by the Laplace formula. Since\nf\u03bb (Bn ) = (1 + Bn )\u22121 \u2212 \u03bbR(\u03bb, Bn ), we deduce that for any n \u2265 1,\nf\u03bb (z) =\n\nk\u03bbR(\u03bb, Bn )k \u2264 K\u03b8 + 1,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 C \\ \u03a3\u03b8 .\n\nBy Lemma 8.18 (1), this implies that A is sectorial of type \u03c9p .\nLikewise using Lemma 8.18 (2) and Theorem 8.14, we obtain that A admits a bounded\n\u221e\nH (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p . This proves the 'bounded' part of (1). To obtain\nthe 'completely bounded' part, it suffices to apply the same argument together with Remark\n8.15 and a obvious completely bounded version of Lemma 8.18.\nWe now prove (2). Note that A may fail to have dense range. We let f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ).\nMultiplying f by the function gn defined by (3.10), we find a bounded sequence (fn )n\u22651 in\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nH0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) such that fn converges pointwise to f on \u03a3\u03b8 \u222a {0}. Since A admits a completely\nbounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus, there is a constant C > 0 such that kfn (A)kcb \u2264\nCkfn k\u221e,\u03b8 for any n \u2265 1. Thus the completely bounded norms of the Schur multipliers\n\u25e6\n\nassociated with [fn (aij )] are uniformly bounded. Passing to the limit, we deduce the result.\n\n\f83\n\nTo prove (3), let t \u2265 0 be any nonnegative real number. For any n \u2265 1, the Schur product\nn\nassociated with [e\u2212taij ] is e\u2212tBn , and the latter is a complete contraction on S p . In fact this is\na complete contraction on S q for any 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e, by arguing as in Remark 8.13 (1). Passing\nto the limit, and using Lemma 8.18 (3), this shows that the the Schur product associated\nwith [e\u2212taij ] is a complete contraction on S q for any 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u221e. By Remark 5.2, this\nsemigroup is a diffusion semigroup.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.19. Proposition 8.17 (1) is no longer true for p \u2208 {1, \u221e}. Indeed consider the\nfollowing example. Take two sequences (tk )k\u22651 and (sk )k\u22651 of positive real numbers, and for\nany i, j \u2265 1, define\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand\n\u03b2j = sj e2j+1\n\u03b1i = ti e2i\non l2 equipped with its canonical basis (ek )k\u22651 . Then k\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b2j k = ti + sj for any i, j \u2265 1.\nHence the operator A to be considered is the Schur multiplier associated with the matrix\n[ti + sj ]. It we take e.g. sk = tk = 2k , it was proved by Uijterdijk [75] that the latter Schur\nproduct does not have any bounded H \u221e functional calculus on S 1 .\n\n\f84\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\n9. Semigroups on q-deformed von Neumann algebras.\n9.A. The case \u22121 < q < 1.\n\nThis section is devoted to semigroups derived from second quantization on von Neumann\nalgebras of q-deformation \u0393q (H) in the sense of Bozejko and Speicher (see [13, 14]). We start\nwith a few definitions and some background, for which we refer the reader to the two latter\npapers and to [15].\nIf H is a complex Hilbert space and n \u2265 0 is an integer, we let H\u2297n be the algebraic n-fold\ntensor product H \u2297 * * * \u2297 H and we let h , i0 be the standard inner product on H\u2297n . By\nconvention, H\u22970 = C. We fix some q \u2208 (\u22121, 1). Then one defines\n(9.1)\n\nh\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032iq = hQq \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032i0 ,\n\n\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 \u2208 H\u2297n ,\n\nwhere Qq : H\u2297n \u2192 H\u2297n is a linear operator defined as follows. Let S n denote the permutation\ngroup on the integers {1, . . . , n} and for any \u03c3 \u2208 S n , let \u03b9(\u03c3) denote the number of inversions\nof \u03c3. Then Qq is defined by\nX\n\u0001\n(9.2)\nQq h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn =\nq \u03b9(\u03c3) h\u03c3(1) \u2297 * * * \u2297 h\u03c3(n) ,\nh1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H.\n\u03c3\u2208S n\n\n1\n\nAccording to [13], Qp is a positive operator on H\u2297n , and \u03b6 7\u2192 h\u03b6, \u03b6iq2 is a norm on H\u2297n . We\nlet H\u2297n\ndenote the resulting completion. Then by definition, the q-Fock space over H is the\nq\nHilbertian direct sum\nF q (H) = \u2295 H\u2297n\nq .\nn\u22650\n\nIn the sequel we will use h , iq to denote the inner product on the whole space F q (H). Since\nits restriction to each H\u2297n\ncoincides with (9.1), there should be no confusion. Accordingly,\nq\nk kq will stand for the norm on F q (H).\nWe let \u03a9 be the unit element in H\u22970 = C. This is usually called the vacuum. For any\nh \u2208 H, the creation operator c(h) on F q (H) is defined by letting c(h)\u03a9 = h,\n\u0001\nc(h) h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn = h \u2297 h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn ,\nh1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H,\nand then extending by linearity and continuity. Indeed,\n\nc(h) : F q (H) \u2212\u2192 F q (H)\n\n\u2297(n+1)\nis a bounded operator taking H\u2297n\nfor any n \u2265 0. Next the annihilation operator\nq into Hq\na(h) : F q (H) \u2192 F q (H) is defined by\n\na(h) = c(h)\u2217 ,\n\nh \u2208 H.\n\nThroughout the rest of this section, we let H be a real Hilbert space, and we let HC denote\nits complexification. We will use the above q-Fock space, as well as creation and annihilation\noperators, for H = HC . For any h \u2208 H, we let\nw(h) = a(h) + c(h).\n\n\f85\n\nThis is a selfadjoint operator on F q (HC ), called a q-Gaussian operator. By definition, the\nvon Neumann algebra of q-deformation associated with H is\n\b\n\u0001\n\u0393q (H) = vN w(h) : h \u2208 H \u2282 B F q (HC ) ,\nthe von Neumann algebra generated by all q-Gaussian operators.\nWe let\n\n(9.3)\n\n\u03c4 (x) = hx\u03a9, \u03a9iq ,\n\nx \u2208 \u0393q (H).\n\nIt was proved in [14] that \u03a9 is a cyclic and separating vector for the von Neumann algebra\n\u0393q (H), so that the mapping\n\u2206 : \u0393q (H) \u2212\u2192 F q (HC ),\n\n\u2206(x) = x(\u03a9),\n\nis one-one and has dense range. Moreover \u03c4 is a normal, faithful, normalized trace on \u0393q (H).\nIn this section, we will consider the noncommutative Lp -spaces Lp (\u0393q (H)) associated with\n\u03c4 . Since\nkxk22 = \u03c4 (x\u2217 x) = kx(\u03a9)k2q\nfor any x \u2208 \u0393q (H), we see that \u2206 extends to a unitary isomorphism\n(9.4)\n\nL2 (\u0393q (H)) \u2243 F q (HC ).\n\nFollowing [15], we now consider the second quantization on q-Fock spaces and von Neumann algebras of q-deformation. Let H1 , H2 be two real Hilbert spaces, with complexifications denoted by H1 and H2 respectively. Let a : H1 \u2192 H2 be a contraction, and let\n\u00e3 : H1 \u2192 H2 denote its complexification. Then there is a (necessarily unique) linear contraction\nFq (a) : F q (H1 ) \u2212\u2192 F q (H2 )\nsuch that Fq (a)(\u03a9) = \u03a9 and for any n \u2265 1,\n\u0001\n(9.5)\nFq (a) h1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 hn = \u00e3(h1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u00e3(hn ),\n\nh1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H1 .\n\n(See [15, Lemma 1.4].) Moreover we have\nFq (a)\u2217 = Fq (a\u2217 )\n\nand\n\nF (aa\u2032 ) = F (a)F (a\u2032 )\n\nfor any contractions a, a\u2032 . Next, there is a (necessarily unique) normal unital completely\npositive map\n\u0393q (a) : \u0393q (H1 ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393q (H2 )\n\nsuch that \u2206 \u25e6 \u0393q (a) = Fq (a) \u25e6 \u2206. Equivalently,\n\n(9.6)\n\n[\u0393q (a)(x)]\u03a9 = Fq (a)(x\u03a9),\n\nx \u2208 \u0393q (H1 ).\n\nThis is established in [15, Section 2]. According to that paper, or using (9.6), we see that\n\u0393q (a)(x) = Fq (a)xFq (a\u2217 )\nfor any x \u2208 \u0393q (H1 ). Hence we deduce that\n\u0001\u2217\n(9.7)\n\u0393q (a)(x) = \u0393q (a)(x\u2217 ),\n\nx \u2208 \u0393q (H1 ).\n\n\f86\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nLemma 9.1. For any contraction a : H1 \u2192 H2 , and any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, the operator \u0393q (a)\n(uniquely) extends to a complete contraction from Lp (\u0393q (H1 )) into Lp (\u0393q (H2 )).\nProof. The proof is similar to the one at the beginning of Section 5. Let x \u2208 \u0393q (H1 ) and\ny \u2208 \u0393q (H2 ). Using (9.3), (9.6), and (9.7), we have\n\u0001\n\u03c4 y \u0393q (a)(x) = hy[\u0393q (a)(x)]\u03a9, \u03a9iq = hyFq (a)(x\u03a9), \u03a9iq\nWe deduce that\n\n= hx\u03a9, Fq (a\u2217 )(y \u2217 \u03a9)iq = hx\u03a9, [\u0393q (a\u2217 )(y \u2217 )]\u03a9iq\n\u0001\n= \u03c4 \u0393q (a\u2217 )(y) x .\n\n\u03c4 y \u0393q (a)(x)\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2264 kxk1 k\u0393q (a\u2217 )(y)k\u221e \u2264 kxk1 kyk\u221e .\n\nTaking the supremum over y in the unit ball of \u0393q (H2 ), we obtain that k\u0393q (a)(x)k1 \u2264\nkxk1 . This shows that \u0393q (a) extends to a contraction \u0393q (a) : L1 (\u0393q (H1 )) \u2192 L1 (\u0393q (H2 )).\nBy interpolation, we deduce that \u0393q (a) : Lp (\u0393q (H1 )) \u2192 Lp (\u0393q (H2 )) is a contraction for any\np \u2265 1. Arguing as in Remark 5.1, we see that \u0393q (a) : Lp (\u0393q (H1 )) \u2192 Lp (\u0393q (H2 )) is actually\na complete contraction.\n\u0003\nRemark 9.2. Under the identification (9.4), the extension of \u0393q (a) to L2 coincides with\nFq (a). It also follows from the above proof that \u0393q (a) is selfadoint (in the sense of (5.1)) if\na : H1 \u2192 H2 is selfadjoint.\nWe now turn to semigroups of operators obtained from second quantization. We will\nsilently use Lemma 9.1, which allows to consider these operators as contractions on noncommutative Lp -spaces.\nLemma 9.3. Let q \u2208 (\u22121, 1). Let H be a real Hilbert space and let (at )t\u22650 be a c0 -semigroup\nof contractions on H. For any t \u2265 0, let Tt = \u0393q (at ) be defined by second quantization on\n\u0393q (H).\n(1) For any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, (Tt )t\u22650 is a completely contractive c0 -semigroup on Lp (\u0393q (H)).\n(2) If further (at )t\u22650 is selfadjoint, then (Tt )t\u22650 is a completely positive diffusion semigroup on \u0393q (H) (in the sense of Section 5).\nProof. For simplicity, we write Lp instead of Lp (\u0393q (H)) along this proof. It is clear that\n(Tt )t\u22650 is a semigroup of complete contractions on each Lp . Since (at )t\u22650 is strongly continuous on H, (\u00e3t )t\u22650 is strongly continuous on HC . Hence (Fq (at ))t\u22650 is strongly continuous\n\u2297n\non each HC\n, by (9.5). By density, it is strongly continuous on F q (HC ). This implies that\n(Tt )t\u22650 is point w \u2217 -continuous on the von Neumann algebra \u0393q (H). In turn, arguing as in\nSection 5, this implies that (Tt )t\u22650 is strongly continuous on Lp for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. This\nproves (1). The assertion (2) now follows from Remark 9.2.\n\u0003\nTheorem 9.4. Let H be a real Hilbert space and let (at )t\u22650 be a c0 -semigroup of contractions\non H. For any q \u2208 (\u22121, 1) and any t \u2265 0, we let Tt = \u0393q (at ). Then for any 1 < p < \u221e, we\nlet \u2212Ap denote the generator of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (\u0393q (H)).\n\n\f87\n\n(1) For any 1 < p < \u221e, and any \u03b8 > \u03c02 , the operator Ap has a completely bounded\nH \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\n(2) If further (at )t\u22650 is selfadjoint, then for any 1 < p < \u221e, and any \u03b8 > \u03c0 1p \u2212 12 , the\noperator Ap has a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\nProof. Clearly part (2) of this theorem follows from Lemma 9.3 (2), Proposition 5.8, and\npart (1). Thus we only have to prove (1). We fix some 1 < p < \u221e and write A = Ap for\nsimplicity. According to [58, Theorem 8.1], there exist a (real) Hilbert space K, a linear\nisometry j : H \u2192 K, and a c0 -group (ut )t\u2208R of orthogonal operators on K such that\nat = j \u2217 ut j,\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\nApplying second quantization, we have \u0393q (at ) = \u0393q (j \u2217 )\u0393q (ut )\u0393q (j), for any t \u2265 0. Owing to\nLemma 9.1, we consider the Lp -realizations of these quantized operators, which we denote\nby\nQ = \u0393q (j \u2217 ) : Lp (\u0393q (K)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (\u0393q (H)),\n\nJ = \u0393q (j) : Lp (\u0393q (H)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (\u0393q (K)),\nand\n\nUt = \u0393q (ut ) : Lp (\u0393q (K)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (\u0393q (K)),\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\nThen J, Q are complete contractions. By Lemma 9.3, (Ut )t is a c0 -group of complete contractions on Lp (\u0393q (K)), or equivalently, a c0 -group of complete isometries. Moreover we have\nthe following dilation property\nTt = QUt J,\n\nt \u2208 R.\n\nThe result therefore follows from Proposition 3.12.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the case when at = e\u2212t IH , (Tt )t\u22650 is the so-called q-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup (see\ne.g. [9, 11]). This is a selfadjoint semigroup, and hence it satisfies the conclusion of Theorem\n9.4 (2).\n9.B. Clifford algebras.\nWe now present an analogue of Theorem 9.4 on Clifford algebras. These algebras correspond to the ones considered in the previous paragraph for q = \u22121, up to some modifications\ndue to the fact that the operator Qq defined by (9.2) has a non trivial kernel if q = \u22121. Instead\nof formally using 9.A, we will consider the (equivalent) usual definition of Clifford algebras\nin terms of antisymmetric products. We refer the reader to [16, 68] for more information.\nIf H is a complex Hilbert space, we let \u039bn (H) denote the n-fold antisymmetric product of\nH, equipped with the canonical inner product given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 hn , h\u20321 \u2227 * * * \u2227 h\u2032n = det hhi , h\u2032j i ,\nhi , h\u2032j \u2208 H.\nBy convention, \u039b0 (H) = C. We let \u03a9 be the unit element of \u039b0 (H). Then the antisymmetric\nFock space over H is the Hilbertian direct sum\n\u039b(H) = \u2295 \u039bn (H).\nn\u22650\n\n\f88\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nFor any h \u2208 H, the creation operator c(h) on \u039b(H) is defined by letting c(h)\u03a9 = h,\n\u0001\nc(h) h1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 hn = h \u2227 h1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 hn ,\nh1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H,\n\nand then extending by linearity and continuity. Its adjoint c(h)\u2217 is the annihilation operator,\ndenoted by a(h).\nNext we consider a real Hilbert space H, we use the above construction on H = HC , and\nwe let w(h) = a(h) + c(h) for any h \u2208 H. These operators are called Fermions. The von\nNeumann Clifford algebra associated with H is\n\b\n\u0001\nC(H) = vN w(h) : h \u2208 H \u2282 B \u039b(HC ) .\n\nWe equip it with the normal faithful normalized trace \u03c4 defined by \u03c4 (x) = hx\u03a9, \u03a9i, and we\nconsider the associated noncommutative Lp -spaces Lp (C(H)).\nIn the analogy with paragraph 9.A, we can think of \u039b(H) and C(H) as being equal to\nF \u22121 (H) and \u0393\u22121 (H) respectively. Then second quantization on these spaces can be defined\nas in 9.A. Namely if a : H1 \u2192 H2 is a contraction between real Hilbert spaces and if \u00e3 denotes\nits complexification, the operator F\u22121 (a) : \u039b(H1 ) \u2212\u2192 \u039b(H2 ) is the (necessarily unique) linear\ncontraction defined by F\u22121 (a)(\u03a9) = \u03a9 and for any n \u2265 1,\n\u0001\n(9.8)\nF\u22121 (a) h1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 hn = \u00e3(h1 ) \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u00e3(hn ),\nh1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H1 .\nNext, \u0393\u22121 (a) : C(H1 ) \u2212\u2192 C(H2 ) is the (necessarily unique) normal unital completely positive\nmap such that\n(9.9)\n\n[\u0393\u22121 (a)(x)]\u03a9 = F\u22121 (a)(x\u03a9),\n\nx \u2208 C(H1 ).\n\nIt is easy to see that Lemmas 9.1 and 9.3, as well as Remark 9.2 extend to the case q = \u22121.\nLikewise, Theorem 9.4 extends to that case with the same proof and we obtain the following\nstatement.\nTheorem 9.5. Let H be a real Hilbert space and let (at )t\u22650 be a c0 -semigroup of contractions\non H. For any t \u2265 0, we let Tt = \u0393\u22121 (at ). Then for any 1 < p < \u221e, we let \u2212Ap denote the\ngenerator of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (C(H)).\n(1) For any 1 < p < \u221e, and any \u03b8 > \u03c02 , the operator Ap has a completely bounded\nH \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\n(2) If further (at )t\u22650 is selfadjoint, then for any 1 < p < \u221e, and any \u03b8 > \u03c0 1p \u2212 12 , the\noperator Ap has a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus.\nAssume now that H is infinite dimensional, and let (ei )i\u22651 be an orthonormal family. We\nlet Wi = w(ei ) for any i \u2265 1. It is well-known that these operators form a 'spin system'.\nNamely they are hermitian unitaries on \u039b(H) and\nWi Wj = \u2212Wj Wi ,\n\nif i 6= j.\n\nWe let I be the set of all increasing finite sequences {i1 < i2 < * * * < im } of positive integers.\nIf F is such a sequence we let\nVF = Wi1 * * * Wim .\n\n\f89\n\nBy convention, the empty set belongs to I, and we let V\u2205 = 1. Also we write |F | for the\ncardinal of F \u2208 I. Since the Wi 's form a spin system, the \u2217-algebra they generate is equal\nto\n\b\nP = Span VF : F \u2208 I .\nThus P is w \u2217 -dense in C(H), and it is dense in Lp (C(H)) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nIt is easy to see that for any F = {i1 < i2 < * * * < im }, we have\nVF \u03a9 = ei1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 eim .\n\nHence the VF 's form an orthonormal basis of L2 (C(H)).\nWe now focus on the completely positive noncommutative diffusion semigroup on C(H)\ndefined by\nTt = \u0393\u22121 (e\u2212t IH ),\nt \u2265 0.\nThis is the Fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. According to the above discussion, we\nhave\nTt (VF ) = e\u2212t|F | VF ,\nt \u2265 0, F \u2208 I.\nThe operator A : P \u2192 P defined by\n\nA(VF ) = |F |VF ,\n\n(9.10)\n\nF \u2208 I,\n\nis called the number operator. It follows from above that for any 1 < p < \u221e, the negative\ngenerator Ap of (Tt )t\u22650 on Lp (C(H)) is an extension of A. Equivalently we can regard Ap as\nan Lp -realization of the number operator.\n\u25e6\n\nFor convenience, we introduce I = I \\ {\u2205}.\nCorollary 9.6. Let 1 < p < \u221e and let \u03b8 > \u03c0\n\n1\np\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nbe an angle. Then for any function\n\u25e6\n\nf \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) and for any finitely supported family of complex numbers {\u03b1F : F \u2208 I }, we\nhave\nX\nX\n\u03b1F V F ,\n\u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8\n\u03b1F f (|F |) VF\n(9.11)\np\n\nF\n\np\n\nF\n\nwhere K > 0 is a constant not depending on f .\n\nProof. Let A = Ap be the negative generator of the Fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup\non Lp (C(H)), and let f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ). We let\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\b\nLp (C(H)) = Span VF : F \u2208 I .\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nAccording to the above discussion and (9.10), we have Lp (C(H)) = R(A). We let A denote\nthe restriction of A to that space. By Theorem 9.5 (2), A admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 )\nfunctional calculus. Hence by Theorem 3.3 and Remark 3.4, we may define a bounded\noperator\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nf (A) : Lp (C(H)) \u2212\u2192 Lp (C(H)),\n\n\f90\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\u25e6\n\nand kf (A)k \u2264 Kkf k\u221e,\u03b8 for some constant K not depending on f . Now using (9.10), we\n\u25e6\n\u0001\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nP\nsee that f (A) takes\nV\nto\nf\n(|F\n|)V\nfor\nany\nF\n\u2208\nI.\nThus\nf\n(\n)\ntakes\n\u03b1\nV\nto\nA\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\u0001\nP\n\u0003\nF \u03b1F f (|F |) VF , which yields (9.11).\nThe latter corollary can be regarded as a result on 'noncommutative Fourier multipliers'\nassociated with a spin system. Indeed, Corollary 9.6 says that the family\n\b\n\u25e6\nf (|F |) : F \u2208 I\n\nis a bounded multiplier on Lp (C(H)) with respect to the basis {VF : F \u2208 I }. In fact, A = Ap\n\u25e6\n\nhas a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus on Lp (C(H)). Hence {f (|F |) : F \u2208 I }\nis a completely bounded multiplier. Namely, (9.11) remains true if (\u03b1F )F is a family lying\nin S p , and multiplication is replaced by tensor products.\n\nWe noticed that results in this paragraph correspond to those in paragraph 9.A in the\ncase q = \u22121. We can do the same in the case q = 1. However the results we may obtain in\nthis case are not new. Indeed for a real Hilbert space H, the von Neumann algebra \u03931 (H)\nis commutative, hence Cowling's Theorem (see Remark 5.9) apply to semigroups on \u03931 (H)\nobtained from second quantization.\n\n\f91\n\n10. A Noncommutative Poisson semigroup.\n10.A. Definitions.\nLet n \u2265 1 be an integer, and let G = Fn be a free group with n generators denoted by\nc1 , . . . , cn . We let e be the unit element of G, and we let (\u03b4g )g\u2208G denote the canonical basis\nof l2G . Then we let \u03bb : G \u2192 B(l2G ) be the left regular representation of G, defined by\n\u03bb(g)\u03b4h = \u03b4gh ,\n\ng, h \u2208 G.\n\nWe recall that the group von Neumann algebra V N(G) \u2282 B(l2G ) is defined as the von\nNeumann algebra on l2G generated by the \u2217-algebra\n\b\nP = Span \u03bb(g) : g \u2208 G .\n\nWe let \u03c4 be the normalized trace on V N(G) defined by \u03c4 (x) = hx(\u03b4e ), \u03b4e i for any x \u2208 V N(G).\nWe will consider the noncommutative Lp -spaces Lp (V N(G)) associated with this trace. For\nany 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, P \u2282 Lp (V N(G)) is a dense subspace. Moreover for any finitely supported\nfamily (\u03b1g )g of complex numbers, we have\n\u0010X\n\u00111\nX\n2 2\n|\u03b1g |\n\u03b1g \u03bb(g) =\n.\ng\n\n2\n\ng\n\nThus we have L2 (V N(G)) = l2G .\nSince G is a free group, any g \u2208 G has a unique decomposition of the form\n(10.1)\n\nk\n\ng = cki11 cki22 * * * cipp ,\n\nwhere p \u2265 0 is an integer, each ij belongs to {1, . . . , n}, each kj is a non zero integer, and\nij 6= ij+1 if 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p \u2212 1. The case when p = 0 corresponds to the unit element g = e. By\ndefinition, the length of g is defined as\n|g| = |k1| + * * * + |kp |.\nThis is the number of factors in the above decomposition of g.\nFor any nonnegative real number t \u2265 0, we let Tt : P \u2192 P be the linear mapping defined\nby letting\n\u0001\n(10.2)\nTt \u03bb(g) = e\u2212t|g| \u03bb(g),\ng \u2208 G.\n\nIt is proved in [30] that this operator uniquely extends to a normal unital completely positive\nmap Tt : V N(G) \u2192 V N(G). It is easy to check that each Tt is selfadjoint (in the sense of\n(5.1)), and that Tt (x) \u2192 x as t \u2192 0+ in the w \u2217 -topology of V N(G), for any x \u2208 V N(G).\nThus (Tt )t\u22650 is a completely positive diffusion semigroup in the sense of Section 5 (see Remark\n5.1).\nLet T be the unit circle. If n = 1, then G = Z, and (Tt )t\u22650 is the classical Poisson\nsemigroup on L\u221e (T).\nDefinition 10.1. The diffusion semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 on V N(Fn ) defined by (10.2) is called the\nnoncommutative Poisson semigroup.\n\n\f92\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nFollowing the notation in Section 5, we let \u2212Ap denote the infinitesimal generator of (Tt )t\u22650\non Lp (V N(G)) for any 1 < p < \u221e. It is clear from (10.2) that P is included in the domain\nof Ap , and that\nAp (\u03bb(g)) = |g| \u03bb(g),\ng \u2208 G.\n\nOur main objective is Theorem 10.12 below, which says that Ap has a (completely) bounded\nH \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus on Lp (V N(G))) for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p = \u03c0|p\u22121 \u2212 2\u22121 |. The proof\nwill require several steps of independent interest. First we will show that each Tt can be\n'dilated by a martingale', see Proposition 10.5. Then in the next paragraph, we will establish square function estimates for noncommutative martingales, which generalize well-known\ncommutative results. In the final part of this section, we will combine these results to obtain\nsquare function estimates for the semigroup (Tt )t\u22650 , and Theorem 10.12 will be deduced\nfrom these estimates. This scheme owes a lot to Stein's proof of square function estimates\nfor commutative diffusion semigroups (see [72, Chapter IV]).\n10.B. Dilation by martingales.\nIf M and M\u2032 are two von Neumann algebras equipped with normalized normal faithful\ntraces \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 , we say that an operator T : M \u2192 M\u2032 preserves traces (or is trace preserving)\nif \u03c4 \u2032 \u25e6 T = \u03c4 on M.\nIf \u03c0 : (M, \u03c4 ) \u2192 (M\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) is a normal unital faithful trace preserving \u2217-representation, then\nit (uniquely) extends to an isometry from Lp (M) into Lp (M\u2032 ) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. In\nfact, these isometries are complete. We call the adjoint Q : M\u2032 \u2192 M of the embedding\nL1 (M) \u0592\u2192 L1 (M\u2032 ) induced by \u03c0 the conditional expectation associated with \u03c0. This map\nis also trace preserving and extends to a complete contraction Lp (M\u2032 ) \u2192 Lp (M) for any\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e. Moreover Q : M\u2032 \u2192 M is unital and completely positive.\nIn fact if M is a von Neumann subalgebra of M\u2032 , and \u03c0 is the canonical embedding, then\nQ is a conditional expectation in the usual sense. In this case, Q is actually the unique\ntrace preserving conditional expectation M\u2032 \u2192 M and we call it the canonical conditional\nexpectation onto M.\nDefinition 10.2. Let M be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normalized trace \u03c4 , and\nlet T : M \u2192 M be a bounded operator. We say that T satisfies Rota's dilation property\nif there exist a von Neumann algebra N equipped with a normalized trace, a normal unital faithful \u2217-representation \u03c0 : M \u2192 N which preserves traces, and a decreasing sequence\n(N m )m\u22651 of von Neumann subalgebras of N such that\n(10.3)\n\nT m = Q \u25e6 E m \u25e6 \u03c0,\n\nm \u2265 1,\n\nwhere E m : N \u2192 N m \u2282 N is the canonical conditional expectation onto N m , and where\nQ : N \u2192 M is the conditional expectation associated with \u03c0.\nRemark 10.3.\n(1) Assume that T : M \u2192 M satisfies Rota's dilation property. Then T is normal, unital,\ncompletely positive, and selfajoint. Indeed let \u03c3 be the trace on N , then for any x, y \u2208 M\n\n\f93\n\nwe have\n\u03c4 (T (x)y) = \u03c4 (QE 1 \u03c0(x)y)\n= \u03c3(E 1 \u03c0(x)\u03c0(y))\n= \u03c3(\u03c0(x)E 1 \u03c0(y))\n= \u03c4 (xQE 1 \u03c0(y)) = \u03c4 (xT (y)).\nSince T is positive, it therefore satisfies (5.1).\nThus in the sequel, we will mostly restrict our attention to operators T which are normal,\nunital, completely positive, and selfadjoint. Note that such an operator is necessarily trace\npreserving. Indeed,\n\u03c4 (T (x)) = \u03c4 (T (x)1) = \u03c4 (xT (1)) = \u03c4 (x1) = \u03c4 (x)\nfor any x \u2208 M.\n\n(2) The above property is named after Rota's Theorem which asserts that if M is commutative, and if T : M \u2192 M is a normal unital positive selfadjoint operator, then T 2 satisfies\nRota's dilation property (see e.g. [72, IV. 9]).\n(3) Let T : M \u2192 M be a normal unital completely positive selfadjoint operator satisfying\nDefinition 10.2. We noticed that \u03c0, E m and Q all extend to associated Lp -spaces. In the\nsequel we will keep the same notation for these extensions. Then it is clear that (10.3) holds\nas well on Lp (M) for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nIf (M1 , \u03c41 ), . . . , (Mn , \u03c4n ) is a finite family of von Neumann algebras equipped with distinguished normalized traces, we let\n(M, \u03c4 ) =\n\n \u0304\u2217 (Mi , \u03c4i )\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\ndenote their reduced free product von Neumann algebra (in the sense of [76, 77]). On the\nother hand, we let \u2217 Mi for the unital algebra free product of the Mi 's, which is a\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2217\n\nw -dense \u2217-subalgebra of M. Then for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we let Mi = Ker(\u03c4i ) \u2282 Mi denote\nthe kernel of \u03c4i . Now suppose that we have a second family (M\u20321 , \u03c4 \u2032 1 ), . . . , (M\u2032 n , \u03c4n\u2032 ) of\nvon Neumann algebras with distinguished normalized traces, with reduced free product von\nNeumann algebra denoted by (M\u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ). Assume further that for each i, we have a normal\nunital completely positive map Ti : Mi \u2192 M\u2032 i which preserves traces. According to [10,\nTheorem 3.8], there is a unique normal unital completely positive map T : M \u2192 M\u2032 such\nthat\nT (x1 * * * xp ) = Ti1 (x1 ) * * * Tip (xp )\n\u25e6\n\nwhenever p \u2265 1 is an integer, ij 6= ij+1 for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p\u22121, and xj \u2208 Mij for any 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p.\nThis map is called the 'free product' of the Ti 's, and we will denote it by\nT = T1  \u0304\u2217 * * *  \u0304\u2217Tn .\n\n\f94\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nThe above algebraic condition determines the free product on the algebra\nfor details).\n\n\u2217 Mi (see [10]\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nLemma 10.4.

By assumption, there exist for any i = 1, . . . , n a von Neumann algebra N i equipped\nwith a normalized trace \u03c3i , a normal unital faithful \u2217-representation \u03c0i : Mi \u2192 N i which\npreserves traces, and a decreasing sequence (N im )m\u22651 of von Neumann subalgebras of N i\nsuch that Tim = Qi \u25e6 E im \u25e6 \u03c0i for any integer m \u2265 1, where E im : N i \u2192 N im \u2282 N i and\nQi : N i \u2192 Mi are the conditional expectations given by Definition 10.2. We consider the\nfree product\n\u03c0 = \u03c01  \u0304\u2217 * * *  \u0304\u2217\u03c0n :  \u0304\u2217 (Mi , \u03c4i ) \u2212\u2192  \u0304\u2217 (N i , \u03c3i ).\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nAccording to [10, Theorem 3.7], the normal unital map \u03c0 is a faithful trace preserving \u2217representation. Likewise for any m \u2265 1, the product \u2217 \u0304 (N im , \u03c3i ) can be regarded as a von\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nNeumann subalgebra of\nWe may also consider\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (N i , \u03c3i ), and the sequence of these subalgebras is decreasing.\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nE m = E 1m \u2217 \u0304 * * *  \u0304\u2217E nm :\nfor any m \u2265 1, and\n\n \u0304\u2217 (N i , \u03c3i ) \u2212\u2192\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nQ = Q1  \u0304\u2217 * * *  \u0304\u2217Qn :\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (N im , \u03c3i ) \u2282\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (N i , \u03c3i ) \u2212\u2192\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (N i , \u03c3i )\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n \u0304\u2217 (Mi , \u03c4i ).\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nAs one might expect, the mapping Q is the conditional expectation associated with \u03c0. Indeed\nQ is normal, unital, completely positive, and preserves traces. Hence it suffices to check that\nQ \u25e6 \u03c0 is the identity mapping on  \u0304\u2217 (Mi , \u03c4i ). Since Qi \u25e6 \u03c0i = I on each Mi , we easily\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nsee that Q \u25e6 \u03c0 = I on the algebra free product\n\n\u2217 Mi . Since Q is normal, this yields the\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nresult. Likewise, E m is the canonical conditional expectation onto\n\nsuffices to show that for any integer m \u2265 1, we have\n\u0001m\n= Q \u25e6 Em \u25e6 \u03c0\nTi1  \u0304\u2217 * * * \u2217 \u0304Tin\n\non\n\n \u0304\u2217 (Mi , \u03c4i ). Again it is easy to check that it holds true on\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nfollows by normality.\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (N im , \u03c3i ). Thus it\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n\u2217 Mi , and the result\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n\u0003\n\nWe now come back to the von Neumann algebra V N(Fn ) equipped with its standard trace\n\u03c4 (see paragraph 10.A). Here we assume\nthat n \u2265 2. We let \u03c41 be the standard trace on\nR\nL\u221e (T), which is given by \u03c41 (f ) = f (z)dm(z) . For any integer k \u2208 Z, let ek denote the\nfunction z 7\u2192 z k on T. For any r \u2208 (0, 1], we let Pr : L\u221e (T) \u2192 L\u221e (T) be the (unique)\n\n\f95\n\nnormal mapping taking ek to r |k|ek for any k. Equivalently, Pr is the convolution operator\nf 7\u2192 pr \u2217 f , with pr equal to the Poisson kernel. It is well-known that\n(10.4)\n\n(V N(Fn ), \u03c4 ) =\n\n\u2217 \u0304 (L\u221e (T), \u03c41 ).\n\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\nWe note that Pr is unital, trace preserving, and positive (hence completely positive). According to our previous discussion we may therefore consider the free product (with n factors)\n(10.5)\n\nPr \u2217 \u0304 * * *  \u0304\u2217Pr : (V N(Fn ), \u03c4 ) \u2212\u2192 (V N(Fn ), \u03c4 ).\n\nIt turns out that for any g \u2208 Fn ,\n\n(Pr  \u0304\u2217 * * *  \u0304\u2217Pr )(\u03bb(g)) = r |g| \u03bb(g).\n\nIndeed, let eik denote the element ek in the ith factor of (L\u221e (T), \u03c41 ) \u0304\u2217 * * *  \u0304\u2217(L\u221e (T), \u03c41 ). If\ni\ng \u2208 G has a factorization (10.1), then \u03bb(g) corresponds to eik11 * * * ekpp through the identification\ni\n\n(10.4). Each kj is non zero, hence each ekjj belongs to the kernel of \u03c41 . Hence by the algebraic\ncharacterization of the free product operator, Pr \u2217 \u0304 * * *  \u0304\u2217Pr takes \u03bb(g) to\ni\n\ni\n\nPr (eik11 ) * * * Pr (ekpp ) = (r |k1| * * * r |kp | ) eik11 * * * ekpp = r |g| \u03bb(g).\nThis shows that for any t \u2265 0, the normal operator Tt : V N(Fn ) \u2192 V N(Fn ) defined by (10.2)\ncoincides with the free product Pe\u2212t \u2217 \u0304 * * *  \u0304\u2217Pe\u2212t . Combining Rota's Theorem (see Remark 10.3\n(2)) and Lemma 10.4, we deduce the following.\nProposition 10.5. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be the noncommutative Poisson semigroup on V N(Fn ) (see\nDefinition 10.2). For any t \u2265 0, the operator Tt satisfies Rota's dilation property.\n10.C. Square function estimates for noncommutative martingales.\nLet (N , \u03c3) be a von Neumann algebra equipped with a normalized normal faithful trace.\nSuppose that (N m )m\u22650 is an increasing sequence of von Neumann subalgebras of N , and let\nE m : N \u2192 N m be the canonical conditional expectations. A noncommutative martingale is\ndefined as a sequence (xm )m\u22650 in L1 (N ) such that E m (xm+1 ) = xm for any m \u2265 0. Clearly\nfor any x \u2208 L1 (N ), the sequence (E m (x))m\u22650 is a martingale.\nLikewise if (N m )m\u22650 is a decreasing sequence, a reverse martingale is a sequence (xm )m\u22650\nin L1 (N ) such that E m+1 (xm ) = xm+1 for any m \u2265 0. Then for any x \u2208 L1 (N ), (E m (x))m\u22650\nis a reverse martingale.\nWe refer the reader to [66], [67, Section 7] and the references therein for information on\nnoncommutative martingales and related square functions, which play a crucial role in this\ntopic. Proposition 10.8 below in a square function estimate for noncommutative martingales,\nwhich generalizes an inequality due to Stein [72, p. 113].\nWe start from another noncommutative generalization of a result of Stein, due to Pisier\nand the third named author.\n\n\f96\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nProposition 10.6.

According to Carleson's Theorem (see e.g. [28, Chapter 7]), (2k )k\u22650 is an interpolating\nsequence for the open right half-plane \u03a3 \u03c02 . This means that for any bounded sequence\n(ck )k\u22650 of complex numbers, there exists a bounded analytic function f : \u03a3 \u03c02 \u2192 C such that\nf (2k ) = ck for any k \u2265 0 and moreover\nkf k\u221e, \u03c02 \u2264 C sup |ck |\nk\n\nfor some constant C \u2265 1 not depending on (ck )k\u22650 . We apply this property with ck = \u03b5k ,\nand we let f \u2208 H \u221e (\u03a3 \u03c02 ) be the resulting interpolating function.\nLet us write\nX\nX\nxk =\n\u03b1g \u03bb(g),\ng\n\nk\u22650\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere {\u03b1g : g \u2208 G} is a finite family of complex numbers.

The non tracial case.\nIn this short paragraph, we briefly discuss extensions of the results established so far to\nthe setting of noncommutative Lp -spaces associated with a non tracial state.\nLet M be a von Neumann algebra and let \u03c6 be a distinguished normal faithful state on M.\nWe do not assume that \u03c6 is tracial. For any 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, we let Lp (M, \u03c6) be the associated\nHaagerup noncommutative Lp -space, with norm denoted by k kp . We refer the reader to [74]\nfor a complete description of these spaces, and to [67] or [37] for a brief presentation. We\nmerely recall if M \u2282 B(H) acts on some Hilbert space H, then Lp (M, \u03c6) is defined as a\nspace of possibly unbounded operators on L2 (R; H) with the following properties. First, if\n1 \u2264 p, q, r \u2264 \u221e are such that p1 + 1q = 1r , then xy \u2208 Lr (M, \u03c6) whenever x \u2208 Lp (M, \u03c6) and\ny \u2208 Lq (M, \u03c6). Second, for any 1 \u2264 p, q < \u221e and any x \u2208 Lp (M, \u03c6), the positive operator\np\n|x| q belongs to Lq (M, \u03c6), with\np\n\nk|x| q kqq = kxkpp .\n\nThird, there are two natural order-preserving isometric identifications\nM \u2243 L\u221e (M, \u03c6)\n\nand\n\nM\u2217 \u2243 L1 (M, \u03c6).\n\nIn particular, \u03c6 may be regarded as a positive element of L1 (M, \u03c6). Consequently for any\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e, we may regard the space\n\b 1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c6 2p M\u03c6 2p = \u03c6 2p x\u03c6 2p : x \u2208 M\n\nas a subspace of Lp (M, \u03c6) and this subspace turns out to be dense. It should be noticed\nthat if p 6= q, then Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2229 Lq (M, \u03c6) = {0}. This is in sharp contrast with the case of\nthe noncommutative Lp -spaces considered so far in this paper (see paragraph 2.A).\nAs usual we let tr : L1 (M, \u03c6) \u2192 C denote the functional corresponding to 1 \u2208 M in the\nabove identification M\u2217 \u2243 L1 (M, \u03c6). It satisfies\ntr(\u03c6x) = \u03c6(x),\n\nx \u2208 M.\n\nWe also recall that if 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and p\u22121 + p\u2032 \u22121 = 1, then\ntr(xy) = tr(yx),\n\n\u2032\n\nx \u2208 Lp (M, \u03c6), y \u2208 Lp (M, \u03c6),\n\nand the duality pairing (x, y) 7\u2192 tr(xy) induces an isometric isomorphism\n\u2032\n\nLp (M, \u03c6) = Lp (M, \u03c6)\u2217 .\n\nFurthermore L2 (M, \u03c6) is a Hilbert space, with inner product given by (x, y) 7\u2192 tr(y \u2217 x).\n\nUsing [37, Section 1], one may naturally define spaces Lp (M, Hc ) and Lp (M, Hr ) for\nany Hilbert space H. Then as in Section 2, we define Lp (M, Hrad ) as the intersection\nLp (M, Hc ) \u2229 Lp (M, Hr ) if 2 \u2264 p < \u221e, and as the sum Lp (M, Hc ) + Lp (M, Hr ) if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2.\nThen it is not hard to check that all the results established in Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7 for the\ntracial noncommutative Lp -spaces extend to the Lp (M, \u03c6)'s.\n\n\f108\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nWe now discuss analogs of the results obtained in Section 5. We need the following\ndefinition. Suppose that (M, \u03c6) and (N , \u03c8) are two von Neumann algebras equipped with\nnormal faithful states \u03c6 and \u03c8. Let T : M \u2192 N be a bounded operator, and let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e.\nConsider the linear mapping from\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c6 2p M\u03c6 2p \u2212\u2192 \u03c8 2p N \u03c8 2p\n\ntaking \u03c6 2p x\u03c6 2p to \u03c8 2p T (x)\u03c8 2p for any x \u2208 M. If this linear operator extends to a bounded\noperator from Lp (M, \u03c6) into Lp (N , \u03c8), we say that T has an Lp extension and we let\nTp : Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2212\u2192 Lp (N , \u03c8)\ndenote the resulting operator.\nLet (M, \u03c6) as above, and let \u03c3 \u03c6 = (\u03c3s\u03c6 )s\u2208R denote the one parameter modular automorphism group of R on M associated with \u03c6. Let T : M \u2192 M be a normal positive contraction\nsuch that\n\u03c6 \u25e6 T \u2264 \u03c6 on M+ .\n\nAccording to [39, Theorem 5.1], T has an Lp extension Tp : Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2192 Lp (M, \u03c6) for any\n1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Assume further that\n\u03c3s\u03c6 \u25e6 T = T \u25e6 \u03c3s\u03c6 ,\n\ns \u2208 R,\n\nand that T is \u03c6-symmetric, that is,\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c6 T (x)y = \u03c6 xT (y) ,\n\nx, y \u2208 M.\n\nThen T2 : L2 (M, \u03c6) \u2192 L2 (M, \u03c6) is a selfadjoint operator. Indeed, let Ma denote the family\nof elements of M which are analytic with respect to \u03c3 \u03c6 . By [39, Proposition 5.5], we have\n1\n1\nT2 (x\u03c6 2 ) = T (x)\u03c6 2 for any x \u2208 Ma . Hence for any x, y \u2208 Ma , we have\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\n1\u0001\nT2 (x\u03c6 2 ), y\u03c6 2 L2 = tr (y\u03c6 2 )\u2217 T (x)\u03c6 2 = tr \u03c6y \u2217 T (x) = \u03c6 y \u2217 T (x)).\n\nLikewise,\n\n1\n\n1\n\nx\u03c6 2 , T2 (y\u03c6 2 )\n1\n\nL2\n\n\u0001\n= \u03c6 T (y \u2217)x .\n\nSince Ma \u03c6 2 is dense in L2 (M, \u03c6) [37, Lemma 1.1], this proves the result.\nTheorem 11.1. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a w \u2217 -continuous semigroup of operators on (M, \u03c6). Assume\nthat for any t \u2265 0, Tt : M \u2192 M is a normal positive \u03c6-symmetric contraction, and that we\nboth have\n\u03c6 \u25e6 Tt \u2264 \u03c6 on M+\nand\n\u03c3s\u03c6 \u25e6 Tt = Tt \u25e6 \u03c3s\u03c6 , s \u2208 R.\n(1) For any t \u2265 0 and any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, the operator Tt admits an Lp extension Tp,t on\nLp (M, \u03c6), and (Tp,t )t\u22650 is a c0 -semigroup of contractions on Lp (M, \u03c6). Moreover\n(T2,t )t\u22650 is a selfadjoint semigroup on L2 (M, \u03c6).\n(2) Let Ap be the negative generator of (Tp,t)t\u22650 . Then for any 1 < p < \u221e, Ap is a\nsectorial operator of type \u03c9p = \u03c0 p1 \u2212 12 .\n\n\f109\n\n(3) Assume further that each Tt : M \u2192 M is completely positive. Then for any 1 < p <\n\u221e, the operator Ap is Col-sectorial (resp. Row-sectorial) of Col-type (resp. Row-type)\nequal to \u03c9p .\nProof. Part (1) easily follows from the previous discussion. Part (2) is an analog of Lemma\n5.4. Its proof relies on interpolation, using Kosaki's Theorem [43]. Part (3) is an analog of\nTheorem 5.6. Its proof is similar to the one of that theorem, using Kosaki's Theorem again\nand the noncommutative ergodic maximal theorem in the non tracial case (see [36, Section\n7]). We skip the details.\n\u0003\nWe now introduce an analogue of Rota's dilation property in the non tracial setting. We\nfollow the scheme of paragraph 10.B. We consider a von Neumann algebra (N , \u03c8) equipped\nwith a normal faithful state \u03c8. Let M \u2282 N be a von Neumann subalgebra and assume\nthat it is invariant under \u03c3 \u03c8 , that is, \u03c3s\u03c8 (M) \u2282 M for any s \u2208 R. Let \u03c6 \u2208 M\u2217 be the\nrestriction of \u03c8 to M. Then \u03c3s\u03c6 = \u03c3s\u03c8 |M for any t. Let 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. Then Lp (M, \u03c6)\ncan be naturally identified with a subspace of Lp (N , \u03c8). Indeed, the canonical embedding\nM \u2192 N has an Lp extension Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2192 Lp (N , \u03c8) in the above sense, and this extension\nis an isometry (see [37, Section 2]). Furthermore there exists a unique normal conditional\nexpectation E : N \u2192 M such that \u03c8 = \u03c6 \u25e6 E [73]. We call it the canonical conditional\nexpectation onto M. This map also has an Lp extension E p : Lp (N , \u03c8) \u2192 Lp (M, \u03c6), and\nthis extension is a contraction [37, Lemma 2.2].\nMore generally, let (M, \u03c6) and (M\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) be two von Neumann algebras equipped with\nnormal faithful states, and let \u03c0 : M \u2192 M\u2032 be a normal unital faithful \u2217-representation such\nthat\n\u0001\n\u2032\n(11.1)\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0\nand\n\u03c3s\u03c6 \u03c0(M) \u2282 \u03c0(M), s \u2208 R.\nThen \u03c0 admits an Lp extension for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and\n\n\u03c0p : Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2212\u2192 Lp (M\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 )\nis an isometry. Let E : M\u2032 \u2192 \u03c0(M) be the canonical conditional expectation onto \u03c0(M)\nand let Q : M\u2032 \u2192 M be defined by \u03c0 \u25e6 Q = E. Then we say that Q is the conditional\nexpectation associated with \u03c0. It is clear that Q has an Lp extension for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\nwith \u03c0p \u25e6 Qp = E p . Moreover Q is the adjoint of \u03c01 .\nThe non tracial analogue of Definition 10.2 is as follows. Let (M, \u03c6) be a von Neumann\nalgebra equipped with a normal faithful state, and let T : M \u2192 M be a bounded operator.\nWe say that T satisfies Rota's dilation property if there exist a von Neumann algebra (N , \u03c8)\nequipped with a normal faithful state, a normal unital faithful \u2217-representation \u03c0 : M \u2192 N\nsuch that \u03c6 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03c0 and \u03c0(M) is invariant under \u03c3 \u03c8 , and a decreasing sequence (N m )m\u22651\nof von Neumann subalgebras of N which are invariant under \u03c3 \u03c8 , such that\nT m = Q \u25e6 E(m) \u25e6 \u03c0,\n\nm \u2265 1,\n\n\f110\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nwhere E(m) : N \u2192 N m \u2282 N is the canonical conditional expectation onto N m , and where\nQ : N \u2192 M is the conditional expectation associated with \u03c0.\nClearly such an operator is completely positive and for any 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, it admits an Lp\nextension Tp : Lp (M, \u03c6) \u2192 Lp (M, \u03c6), with Tp = Qp \u25e6 E(1)p \u25e6 \u03c0p . It is not hard to show that\nin addition, T is \u03c6-symmetric.\nWith the above definition, Corollary 10.9 extends to the non tracial case. The proof is\nthe same, using the noncommutative martingale inequalities from [37, Section 3].\nCorollary 11.2. Let (Tt )t\u22650 be a w \u2217 -continuous semigroup of operators on (M, \u03c6). Assume\nthat for any t \u2265 0, Tt : M \u2192 M satisfies the above Rota's dilation property. Then it satisfies\nTheorem 11.1 and moreover, the operator Ap admits a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus\non Lp (M, \u03c6) for any \u03b8 > \u03c9p and any 1 < p < \u221e.\nProof. The proof is similar to the one of Theorem 10.12, using Theorem 11.1 instead of\nTheorem 5.6.\n\u0003\nFollowing [4], we say that T : (M, \u03c6) \u2192 (M, \u03c6) is factorizable if there exist a von Neumann\nalgebra (M\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) equipped with a normal faithful state, and two normal unital faithful \u2217representations\n\u03c0 : M \u2212\u2192 M\u2032\nand\n\u03c0\ne : M \u2212\u2192 M\u2032\ne\ne : M\u2032 \u2192 M is the conditional expectation\nboth satisfying (11.1), such that T = Q\u25e6\u03c0,\nwhere Q\nassociated with \u03c0\ne. According to [4, Theorem 6.5], T 2 : M \u2192 M satisfies Rota's dilation\nproperty if T is factorizable and \u03c6-symmetric.\nConsequently, if (Tt )t\u22650 is a w \u2217 -continuous semigroup of operators on M such that each\noperator Tt : M \u2192 M is both factorizable and \u03c6-symmetric, then it gives rise to a semigroup\n(Tp,t )t\u22650 on Lp (M, \u03c6) whose negative generator has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus,\nprovided that 1 < p < \u221e and \u03b8 > \u03c9p .\n\n\f111\n\n12. Appendix.\n12.A. Comparing row and column square functions.\nWe aim at showing that in general, row and column square functions as defined by (6.1)\nare not equivalent. We will provide an example on Schatten spaces S p = S p (l2 ). We let\n(ek )k\u22651 denote the canonical basis of l2 and we let a be the unbounded positive selfadjoint\noperator on l2 such that\n\u0010X\n\u0011 X\na\n\u03b1k ek =\n\u03b1k 2k ek\nk\n\nk\n\nfor any finite family (\u03b1k )k of complex numbers.\nWe fix some 1 < p < \u221e, and we let Ap = La be the left multiplication by a on S p (see\nparagraph 8.A). For any \u03b8 > 0, the operator a has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus\non l2 . Hence Ap also has a bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus on S p , by Proposition\n8.4. Since a has dense range, it also follows from the latter proposition that Ap has dense\nrange. Applying Theorem 7.6, we therefore obtain that for any \u03b8 > 0, and any non zero\nF \u2208 H0\u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ), we have an equivalence\nx \u2208 S p.\nR\u221e\n\u00011\nLemma 12.1.

By Proposition 8.4, Ap has a completely bounded H \u221e (\u03a3\u03b8 ) functional calculus for\nany \u03b8 > 0. Hence by Theorems 4.12 and 6.7, it suffices to prove the result for one specific\nfunction F . Throughout the proof, we will use the function\n1\n\nF (z) = z 2 e\u2212z .\nIn the notation introduced in Lemma 12.1, we have cF = \u221a12 .\nWe first assume that p > 2. For any integer k \u2265 0, we let\nZ \u221e\ndt\ndk =\nF (t)F (t2k ) .\nt\n0\nWe will use the fact that for any i, j \u2265 1, we have\nZ \u221e\ndt\n= d|i\u2212j|.\nF (t2i )F (t2j )\nt\n0\n\nIndeed this is obtained by changing t into t2j in this integral.

Taking the integral over \u03a90 , and applying the row version\nof Proposition 6.2, we deduce that\nn\nX\n2\nkxkF,r =\nd|i\u2212j| Eij p .\ni,j=1\n\nS2\n\n\f113\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nWe let \u2206 = d|i\u2212j| be the n \u00d7 n matrix in the right hand side of the above formula.

Hence kxk2F,r \u2264 2 n. Since kxk2F,c = n2 , we also\nobtain (1) in that case.\nWe now turn to the proof of (2). We assume that 1 < p < 2, and we let p\u2032 be its conjugate\n\u2032\nnumber. According to Remark 8.7 (2), A\u2217p is the right multiplication by a on S p . For any\n\u2032\ny \u2208 S p , we let kykF,c and kykF,r denote the column and row square functions corresponding\nto A\u2217p . Of course Lemma 12.1 has an analog for right multiplications, and the latter says\n\u2032\nthat kykF,r = cF kyk for any y \u2208 S p . Likewise, part (1) of Proposition 12.2 has an analog\nfor A\u2217p , namely\n\u001a\n\u001b\nkykF,r\np\u2032\n(12.3)\nsup\n: y\u2208S\n= \u221e.\nkykF,c\nTo prove (2), assume on the contrary that there is a constant K > 0 such that\n(12.4)\n\u2032\n\nkxkF,r \u2264 KkxkF,c ,\n\nx \u2208 S p.\n\nLet y \u2208 S p and x \u2208 S p . We consider the approximating sequence (gn )n\u22651 defined by (3.10)\nand we recall that gn (Ap )(x) = gn (a)x \u2192 x when n \u2192 \u221e. By the first part of Lemma 6.5,\nwe have\n\u221a Z \u221e\ndt\nhy, gn(Ap )(x)i = 2\nhy, F (tAp )2 (gn (a)x)i\nt\n0\nZ\n\u221e\n\u221a\ndt\n= 2\nhF (tAp )\u2217 (y), F (tAp )(gn (a)x)i .\nt\n0\n\n\f114\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nAccording to Lemma 2.8, this implies that\nhy, gn(Ap )(x)i \u2264\n\n\u221a\n\n2 kgn (a)xkF,r kykF,c.\n\nNow using (12.4) and Lemma 12.1, we deduce that\n\u221a\nhy, gn (Ap )(x)i \u2264 2K cF kgn (a)xk kykF,c \u2264 K kxk kykF,c.\nPassing to the limit when n \u2192 \u221e, this yields |hy, xi| \u2264 K kxkkykF,c. Then taking the\n\u2032\nsupremum over all x \u2208 S p with kxk = 1, we obtain that kyk \u2264 KkykF,c for any y \u2208 S p .\nSince kykF,r = cF kyk, this contradicts (12.3) and completes the proof of (2).\n\u0003\n12.B. Measurable functions in Lp (L2 ).\nLet 2 < p < \u221e. The Banach space Lp (R; L2 (R)) can be described as the space of all\nmeasurable functions g : R2 \u2192 C such that\nZ \u221e \u0010Z \u221e\n\u0011 p2\np\nkgkLp (L2 ) =\n|g(s, t)|2 dt ds < \u221e ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nmodulo the functions which vanish almost everywhere on R2 . Then it is easy to check that\na function g \u2208 Lp (R; L2 (R)) is representable by a measurable function u : R \u2192 Lp (R) in the\nsense of Definition 2.7 if and only if\nZ \u221e\n|g(s, t)|p ds < \u221e\nfor a.e. t \u2208 R.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIndeed in that case we have u(t) = g(* , t) for almost every t \u2208 R. We will prove that not all\nelements of Lp (R; L2 (R)) are representable by a measurable function from R into Lp (R) by\nexhibiting a function g \u2208 Lp (R; L2 (R)) such that\nZ \u221e\n(12.5)\n|g(s, t)|p ds = \u221e\nfor a.e. t \u2208 R.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFor any positive numbers a, b, m such that b \u2265 a, let Pa,b,m \u2282 R2 be the parallelogram with\nvertices equal to (\u2212a, 0), (0, 0), (b, mb), and (b \u2212 a, mb). Thus this parallelogram has a pair\nof horizontal sides, and a pair of sides having slope equal to m. Next we let ga,b,m be the\nindicator function of Pa,b,m . It is clear that\nZ \u221e\n(12.6)\n|ga,b,m (s, t)|p ds = a\n0 \u2264 t \u2264 mb.\n\u2212\u221e\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nkga,b,m kpLp (L2 )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\np\n2\n\np\n2\n\nZ\n\nb\n\np\n\n(m(b \u2212 s)) 2 ds\n(m(s + a)) ds + (b \u2212 a) (ma) +\nb\u2212a\n\u2212a\n\u0010 Z a p\n\u0011\np\np\n= m2 2\ns 2 ds + (b \u2212 a) a 2\n0\np\u0001\np\np\np\n1+ p2\n2\n+ (b \u2212 a) a 2 = m 2 a 2 (a + b).\n\u2264 m 2a\n=\n\n\f115\n\nSince we assumed that b \u2265 a, this yields\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nkga,b,m kLp (L2 ) \u2264 2 p b p m 2 a 2 .\n\n(12.7)\n\nWe now make special choices for our parameters a, b, m. Let n \u2265 1 be an integer. We let\nan = 4np ,\n\nand then we choose bn and mn so that\n1\n\nbn mn = n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nWriting bnp mn2 an2 = bnp\n\n\u2212 12\n\n1\n\nand\n\n1\n\n1\n\nbnp mn2 an2 = 1.\n\nnp\n\n(mn bn ) 2 4 2 , this leads to the following choice:\np\n\nnp2\n\nbn = n p\u22122 4 p\u22122\n\nand\n\n2\n\nnp2\n\nmn = n\u2212 p\u22122 4\u2212 p\u22122 .\n\n\u0001\np2\n2\nNote that since p > 2, we have p\u22122\n= p 1 + p\u22122\n\u2265 p and therefore we have an \u2264 bn . Then\nwe simply let gn for the function gan ,bn ,mn studied so far. According to (12.6) and (12.7), we\n1\nboth have kgn kLp (L2 ) \u2264 2 p and\nZ \u221e\n|gn (s, t)|p ds = 4np\n0 \u2264 t \u2264 n.\nTherefore we can define\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ng=\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\n2\u2212n gn \u2208 Lp (R; L2 (R)).\n\nMoreover since each gn is nonnegative, we have g \u2265 2\u2212n gn \u2265 0 for any n \u2265 1. Thus for\nt \u2265 0, we have\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\np\n\u2212np\n|gn (s, t)|p ds \u2265 2np\n|g(s, t)| ds \u2265 2\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nR\u221e\nprovided that n \u2265 t. Hence \u2212\u221e |g(s, t)|p ds = \u221e. This proves (12.5) for t \u2265 0. An obvious\nmodification yields a function g for which (12.5) holds for t \u2208 R.\n\n\f116\n\nMARIUS JUNGE, CHRISTIAN LE MERDY AND QUANHUA XU\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
