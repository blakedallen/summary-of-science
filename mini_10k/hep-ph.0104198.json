Aside from being the natural\nmarriage of form factors and parton distributions, SPD's appear when one tries to calculate hadronic matrix elements\nsuch as in Compton scattering [3, 4, 5], and the electroproduction of mesons [6, 7].\nThere is much effort underway related to the measurement of these functions [8]. Intuitively clear, but simple\nmodels [3, 9, 10, 11] have been used to provide first calculations (and more sophisticated approaches have been pursued\n[12, 13]). In this paper, we attempt to gain intuition about the structure of these distributions, using simple light-front\nwave functions. We find a new feature, bimodality (or double peaks), which is rather general and thus independent of\nsophisticated formalism. To this end, we work only with simple, two-body, model wave-functions for scalar particles\nand express the SPD as a convolution of these light-front wave-functions. This is, of course, a (very) specific instance of\nthe general light-cone Fock-space expansion of the SPD's carried out in [14]. Of crucial importance is the employment\nof non-Gaussian wave-functions. As we shall show, the bimodal nature of SPD's is absent for Gaussian wave-functions.\nWe remark that the bimodality of these distributions has been encountered before in [12] where the authors study the\nSPD's in the chiral quark-soliton model of the nucleon. There it was shown that contributions from discrete levels and\nthe Dirac continuum interfere, resulting in a roughly bimodal quark distribution (for x > \u03be). We show below that there\nexists a rather general explanation for the bimodal behavior in terms of light-front wave-functions.\nWe review the definition and kinematics of the SPD in section 2 and proceed to the two-body Fock space in section\n3. Once in section 4, we present the wave-functions used and then provide a visual array of SPD's illustrating their\nfunctional behavior. Finally we conclude briefly in section 5.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDefinitions and kinematics\n\nThe skewed parton distribution is a non-diagonal matrix element of bilocal field operators. Various conventions, reference\nframes, variables, etc. exist for the description of such an object. Below we adopt the conventions of the off-forward\nparton distribution of Ji [15]. This choice is natural for a symmetric treatment of initial and final hadron states and\nconsequently time-reversal invariance will be manifest.\nWe shall consider the SPD for a toy scalar \"meson\" of mass M consisting of two scalar \"quarks\", each of mass m.\nSuch a model restricts the SPD to only one kinematical r\u00e9gime (one that is diagonal in Fock-space). This restriction\nin modeling SPD's was encountered from the start [10], and we take up the issue of extending model SPD's to all\nkinematical r\u00e9gimes in [16].\nLet us parameterize\nthe kinematics as follows. The initial meson momentum is denoted by P\u03bc = (P \u2212 , P + , P\u22a5 ), with\n\u221a\n\u00b1\n0\n3\nP = (P \u00b1 P )/ 2, and the final meson momentum is denoted P\u2032\u03bc . The average momentum between initial and final\nstates is thus P\u0304\u03bc = (P\u03bc + P\u2032\u03bc )/2. Defining x P\u0304+ to be the momentum conjugate to light-front distance y\u2013 , we have [17]\ni P\u0304+\nF (x, \u03be, t) =\n2(P+ +P \u2032+ )\n\nZ\n\nd y\u2013 i y\u2013 x P\u0304+\ne\nh P\u2032 | \u03c6\u0302\u2020 (\u2212 y\u2013 /2) \u2202 + \u03c6\u0302(y\u2013 /2) \u2212 \u2202 + \u03c6\u0302\u2020 (\u2212 y\u2013 /2) \u03c6\u0302(y\u2013 /2) | P i,\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the skewness \u03be is defined by \u03be = \u2212\u2206+ /2 P\u0304+ with \u2206 as the momentum transfer suffered by the meson, namely\n\u2206\u03bc = P\u2032\u03bc \u2212 P\u03bc , with P\u22a5\u2032 = \u2212P\u22a5 = \u2206\u22a5 /2, and the invariant t \u2261 \u22062 . As spelled out in [15], time-reversal invariance\nforces F (x, \u03be, t) = F (x, \u2212\u03be, t). It is easy to see why this must be the case in Eq. (1) owing to the reality of F and the\nHermiticity of the current operator. Without any loss of generality, we take \u03be > 0 below. Notice the form of the above\nequation is such that when integrated over all x, we recover the electromagnetic form factor (calculated from the +\ncomponent of the current operator).\nHaving set forth all kinematical variables, we must then use Lorentz invariance to derive any remaining relations\namong them. Since our final meson is still intact, P 2 = P \u20322 = M 2 and thus P\u0304 2 = M 2 \u2212 t/4. Exploiting \u2206 * P\u0304 = 0, we\nfind \u2206\u2212 = \u03be P\u0304 2 / P\u0304+ , and also an expression for the transverse momentum transfer\n\u2206\u22a52 = \u22124\u03be 2 M 2 \u2212 t(1 \u2212 \u03be 2 ).\n\n(2)\n\np\nThis implies a maximal skewness \u03bem = 1/ 1 \u2212 4M 2 /t for a given t.\nIn order to unearth the physics hidden in Eq. (1), we insert the mode expansion [18] of the scalar field operators:\n\u03c6\u0302(y\u2013 , y\u22a5 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u2013 +\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nd k+ d k\u22a5\n\u221a\n\u03b8(k+ ) \u00e2(k+ , k\u22a5 ) e\u2212i(y k \u2212y *k ) ,\n+\n3\n2 k (2\u03c0)\n\n(3)\n\nwith the quark creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relation\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u00e2(k+ , k\u22a5 ), \u00e2\u2020 (\u03ba+ , \u03ba\u22a5 ) = (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k+ \u2212 \u03ba+ )\u03b4 2 (k\u22a5 \u2212 \u03ba\u22a5 ).\n\n(4)\n\nEvaluating the plus-derivative of the field operators and inserting this along with the mode expansion Eq. (3) into\nthe expression for the SPD, we find\n\nF (x, \u03be, t) =\n\n3\n\n1\n4\n\nZ\n\nk + + \u03ba+ +\nd k+ d k\u22a5 d \u03ba+ d \u03ba\u22a5\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b8(k+ )\u03b8(\u03ba+ )\u03b4(x P\u0304+ \u2212\n)(k + \u03ba+ ) h P\u2032 | \u00e2\u2020 (\u03ba+ , \u03ba\u22a5 ) \u00e2(k+ , k\u22a5 ) | P i . (5)\n2\n2 k+ (2\u03c0)3 2 \u03ba+ (2\u03c0)3\n\nTwo-body, truncated Fock space\n\nWe now proceed with representing the SPD as a convolution of light-front wave functions. In order to do so, we must\nwrite the meson states as sums of their light-front Fock-space components. The light-front Fock-space is the ideal arena\n2\n\n\fin which to decompose hadronic states [19, 20], since, apart from zero-modes, the perturbative vacuum is trivial. In\nthis formalism, physical matrix elements are then expressed as a sum of Fock-space component overlaps (in general\nthese overlaps are non-diagonal in particle number). The general form of the SPD written in terms of N -body Fock\nspace components was carried out in Ref. [14] and is a natural choice for these distributions since, e.g. the positivity\nconstraints [21] are automatically satisfied [10]. Since one has little knowledge concerning viable N -body light-front\nwavefuntions, this formalism is limited to the lower Fock-space components. In order to gain initial intuition about the\nSPD's, we shall limit ourselves to the two-body sector at the cost of neglecting one kinematical region.\nWith a truly empty perturbative light-front vacuum \u00e2|0i = 0, we can build our quark states from the vacuum in the\nusual fashion\n|ki \u2261 |q; k+ , k\u22a5 i = \u00e2\u2020 (k+ , k\u22a5 ) |0i.\n\n(6)\n\nWe shall keep the Fock-space as small as possible by truncating at quark pairs. In this approximation, our meson states\nappear as\n| P i = 2 P+ (2\u03c0)3\n\nZ \u0010Y\n2\nd p+ j d p\u22a5 j \u0011 2,+\nq\n\u03b4 (P \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03a8(p1 , p2 ) | p1 , p2 i .\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2p+\nj=1\nj\n\n(7)\n\nSeveral points must be clarified about the above expression. We are using shorthand notation for light-front momenta.\nUpper-case letters refer to meson momenta, while quark momenta are denoted by lower-case. The components (+, \u22a5)\nare now implicit and we have notationally condensed the three-dimensional light-front delta function into \u03b4 2,+ .\nThe light-front wave function \u03a8 appears in Eq. 7. The remarkable property of light-front wave functions is that they\ndepend only on the relative momenta of their constituents, not on the hadron's momentum [22].

Carrying out the change of variables allows us to perform the integral over d2,+ P\ntrivially since now the delta function \u03b4 2,+ (P \u2212P) sits in the integrand.

(5) is to restrict the value of x: 1 > x > \u03be. In the other\nkinematical r\u00e9gime, \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be, the SPD represents the amplitude to annihilate a quark pair from the initial meson\nstate. Naturally the SPD in this r\u00e9gime depends upon the higher Fock components, which we neglect here.\nThe above result is consistent with the time-reversal invariance of our starting expression Eq. (1) since it is clearly\neven in \u03be. In the forward limit (t = 0), we recover the toy model quark distribution function\nF (x, 0, 0) =\n\nZ\n\nd k\u22a5\n|\u03c8(x, k\u22a5 )|2 \u2261 q(x).\n2(2\u03c0)3 x(1 \u2212 x)\n\n(15)\n\nFinally in the case of zero skewness we should arrive at the electromagnetic form-factor (after having integrated over x)\n[3]. We find\nZ\n\ndxF (x, 0, t) =\n\nZ\n\ndxd k\u22a5\n\u03c8(x, k\u22a5 )\u03c8 \u2217 (x, k\u22a5 +(1 \u2212 x)\u2206\u22a5 ) \u2261 F (t),\n2(2\u03c0)3 x(1 \u2212 x)\n\n(16)\n\nwhich is indeed the Drell-Yan formula [23]. As pointed out in Ref. [10], the restriction to one kinematical r\u00e9gime (x > \u03be)\ndoes not allow for the sum rule to be verified-Eq. (16) is as much as we can hope for now. We shall take up the issue\nof verifying the sum rule in Ref. [16].\nNote that the form of the SPD does not support various factorization Ans\u00e4tze[24]. For example, in the limit \u03be \u2192 0,\nF (x, \u03be, t) 6= q(x)F (t), though this Ansatz does satisfy the sum rule. Such a factorized form only holds for Gaussian wave\nfunctions when \u03be = 0. Counting the number of field operators in equation 1, we see there is no physical basis for such a\nfactorized Ansatz when \u03be = 0.\n\n4\n\nModel wave functions\n\nIt remains only to choose two-body light-front wave functions to explore the SPD derived in Eq. (14). Before we do\nso, it is wise to review the existing literature on modeling SPD's. Radyushkin investigated them for a scalar toy model\n[3] deriving analytical results. They were investigated for a bag model of the nucleon in [9], in the chiral quark-soliton\nmodel [12] and in 1 + 1 dimensional QCD [13]. More in line with our above analysis, SPD's were modeled using lightfront Fock-space components in [10] (using N -body Gaussian wave functions for low values of N ), for the pion using a\nGaussian wave function in[11], and for the QED electron in [25].\nWe will use three different wave functions to contrast the behavior of the SPD: a Gaussian (G), the Hulth\u00e9n wave\nfunction (H) of Ref. [26], and the (weak-binding) Wick-Cutkosky wave function (WC) of Ref. [27]. Each wave function\ncontains a normalization constant N (determined from the normalization condition used above in Eq. (9)) and is chosen\nto be symmetric about x = 1/2.\nOur Gaussian wave function is taken to be\np\n2\n+m2\nN f (x) \u2212 k\u03bc\u22a5\n\u22a5\ne 2 x(1\u2212x) ,\n(17)\n\u03c8G (x, k ) =\nm\n4\n\n\fGaussian\n\nHulthen\n\n5\n\n20\n\n15\n\nF( x, 0, 0 )\n\nF( x, 0, 0 )\n\n4\n3\n2\n\n10\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\nWick-Cutkosky\n\n50\n\nF( x, 0, 0 )\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: Quark distribution functions F (x, 0, 0) plotted verses x for the models under consideration.\n\nwhere f (x) = x2 (1 \u2212 x)2 is similar to a valence quark distribution (the difference from the quark distribution of Eq.(15)\nM\nis due to the mass term in the exponential). We choose m\n\u03bc = 1 and \u03bc = 1.8.\nThe Hulth\u00e9n wave function has the form\n\u221a\n\u0001\nm N x(1 \u2212 x)\n\u22a5\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(18)\n\u03c8H (x, k ) =\n2 \u03b4a \u2212 \u03b4b ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u22a5\n4x(1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 + (2x \u2212 1) m + k\n\na b\nwith m\n, m chosen to be the phenomenological deuteron parameters.\nLastly the Wick-Cutkosky wave function in the weak-binding limit is\n\u221a\nm3 N x2 (1 \u2212 x)2\n1\n\u22a5\n\u03c8W C (x, k ) =\n2 2 1 + |2x \u2212 1| ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u22a5\n(4x(1 \u2212 x)\u03ba + (2x \u2212 1) m + k )\n\n(19)\n\nwith \u03ba = 12 ma, the meson mass M = 2m \u2212 14 ma2 . We choose a suitably weak coupling of a = 0.08. The form of the\nwave function is basically Coulombic with a multiplicative retardation term.\nIn Figure 1 we contrast the quark distribution function for each of the toy models under consideration. The models\nclearly differ in how narrowly the quark distribution is peaked. The Wick-Cutkosky distribution appears sharply peaked\nat x = 1/2 which is characteristic of a weakly bound system.\nNext in Figure 2, we use our Gaussian wave function \u03c8G in Eq. (14) to reproduce a typical Gaussian SPD found\nin the literature. We note the distribution maintains its characteristic Gaussian shape as a function of \u03be. The peak of\nthe distribution, however, appears to be suppressed as \u03be increases up to \u03bem . Since (as we will show) the special form\nof the Gaussian wave function obscures the general structure of the SPD, we proceed to consider the power-law wave\nfunctions.\nLet us plot the SPD using Eq. (14) for the Wick-Cutkosky wave function \u03c8W C . In Figure 3, we show the \u03be = 0.07\nslice of the SPD at \u2212t/m2 = 0.1. The distribution is bimodal, with the two peaks displaced from x = 1/2. To understand\nthis feature, we crank up the momentum transfer to \u2212t/m2 = 100. The larger momentum transfer allows us to probe\na larger skewness (since \u03bem increases with \u2212t). At this higher momentum transfer, let us look at another \u03be-slice of the\nSPD as a function of x shown in Figure 4.\nPerhaps the bimodal nature of the distribution is not too surprising, after all the SPD is a convolution of two hadronic\nwave functions. The weak binding Wick-Cutkosky wave function is by nature highly peaked at x = 1/2.

The SPD\nis plotted as a function of x for \u2212t/m2 = 100 and \u03be = 0.1.\nover the transverse momentum k\u22a5 in Eq. (14) does not affect the location of the peak. Due to the convoluted nature\nof the SPD, the x location of the wave function's peak becomes a function of \u03be. Let us denote the location of \u03c8's\npeak-\u03c8( \u03b1(x, \u03be), k\u22a5 ) with the arguments in Eq. (14)-as xp (\u03be) and that of \u03c8 \u2217 by x\u0304p (\u03be). Using Eq. (14), we find\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03be)\n2\n1\nx\u0304p (\u03be) = (1 + \u03be).\n2\n\nxp (\u03be) =\n\nThus for fixed t, as the skewness \u03be is increased, the peaks of \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 trek in opposite directions. For \u03be = 0.1, the peak\nof \u03c8 should be located at xp = 0.45 and that of \u03c8 \u2217 at x\u0304p = 0.55. Looking back at Figure 4 shows us this is indeed the\ncase. This allows us to understand the peaks' behavior for the full range of \u03be shown in Figure 5, where we see a ripple\nwhich heads to smaller x as \u03be increases. Once \u03be > 1/3 we can be assured the SPD's peak is due to \u03c8 \u2217 . But the figure\nopens up new questions. What can we say about the height of the peaks?\nLooking at all the SPD's displayed so far for the Wick-Cutkosky model, generally the peaks at lower x which stem\nfrom \u03c8 aren't quite the lofty summits as those from \u03c8 \u2217 which are at higher x. This asymmetry is due to the prefactor\nx(1\u2212\u03be 2 )\n\u2217\nin the SPD: (1\u2212x)(x\nare\n2 \u2212\u03be 2 ) which generally increases with increasing x for fixed values of \u03be. Thus the peaks due to \u03c8\npreferentially enhanced while those due to \u03c8 tend to be flattened as they trek to lower x.\nTaking a second glance at Figure 5, we see another feature of these distributions. The peak which we attribute to \u03c8 \u2217\nis amplified with increasing \u03be. To be able to make definite statements, we take the asymptotic limit and appropriately\nanalyze the SPD. (We will find that this leads to generally true qualitative information for lower momentum transfer.)\nThe Wick-Cutkosky wave function has power-law dependence, and so we appeal to the approach of Brodsky and Lepage\n[19] of approximating integrals over k\u22a5 using the knowledge that our wave functions are peaked for low values of k\u22a5 .\nLooking at Eq. (14) and taking \u2206\u22a5 very large compared to k\u22a5 , we realize the dominant contributions come from either\n1\u2212x\nk\u22a5 \u2248 0 or k\u22a5 \u2248 \u2212 1\u2212\u03be\n2 \u2206\u22a5 for which one of the wave functions is greatly suppressed. This gives:\n!\nx(1 \u2212 \u03be 2 )\n\u2217\n\u22a5\n\u2217\n\u22a5\n\u03c6(x1 )\u03c8 (x2 , (1 \u2212 x\u0304)\u2206 ) + \u03c6 (x2 )\u03c8(x1 , \u2212(1 \u2212 x\u0304)\u2206 ) ,\nF (x, \u03be, t/m \u226b 1) \u2248\n2(2\u03c0)3 (1 \u2212 x)(x2 \u2212 \u03be 2 )\n2\n\n(20)\n\nR\nx\u2212\u03be\nwhere \u03c6(x) = d k\u22a5 \u03c8(x, k\u22a5 ) and we've abbreviated the plus-momentum fraction arguments as x1 = x+\u03be\n1+\u03be , x2 = 1\u2212\u03be\nand their average x\u0304 = (x1 + x2 )/2. Notice that the above equation reproduces the correct location of the peaks as a\nfunction of x. The Wick-Cutkosky wave function, as well as the Hulth\u00e9n behave as \u03c8 \u223c 1/t2 for large |t|. In a realistic\ncalculation, one would use wave functions calculated from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). These\nwave functions have different asymptotic behavior (\u03c8pQCD \u223c 1/t) than our model wave functions since the dynamics of\npQCD stems from vector exchange (unlike the scalar exchange implicitly employed by our models). The pQCD analysis\nof the pion's SPD was carried out in [28].\n7\n\n\f0.8\n\n0.6\n\nln\n\nSPD\n\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-12\n0\n\n0.4\n\n\u03be\n\n0.2\n0.25\n0.5\nx\n\n0.75\n0\n1\n\nFigure 5: Skewed parton distribution for Wick-Cutkosky Model, with the model parameter a = 0.08, evaluated for\n\u2212t/m2 = 100. This asymptotic momentum transfer allows us to see and understand the general features of the\ndistribution. Notice we plot the natural logarithm of the SPD.\n\nUsing the form of Eq. (20), we can deduce whether the wave functions are being stressed by increasing \u03be. The wave\nfunctions will be stressed depending on whether larger transverse momentum flows through them as \u03be increases. Thus\nwe are concerned as to whether (1 \u2212 x\u0304)\u2206\u22a5 increases with \u03be (for fixed t and x). Taking the derivative with respect to\n\u03be shows that the change in transversal momentum flow depends upon the sign of |t|(1 \u2212 \u03be 2 ) \u2212 (1 + \u03be 2 )4M 2 . Hence,\nif |t|/4M 2 < 1, then less momentum will flow through the wave functions as \u03be increases. Otherwise, there is initially\nincreasing momentum flow (starting from \u03be = 0) followed by decreasing momentum flow with \u03be [29]. In either case, as\n\u03be approaches its maximum value (the maximal skewness \u03bem ), there is less transverse momentum flowing through the\nwave functions in Eq. (20) and consequently the height of the summit (centered at x\u0304p ) will increase.\nThis fact is evidenced by Figure 5. Given the (natural) logarithmic scale, we see the SPD increases by a factor\n\u223c 10 near maximal skewness. To quantitatively understand this rise in the distribution, we'd be wise to consider the\ntransverse momentum flowing through the wave functions. The ratio of the transverse momentum flow (in asymptopia)\nto the mass is given by \u03b4(\u03be) = (1 \u2212 x\u0304)|\u2206\u22a5 |/M . For fixed x (say near the peak of \u03c8 \u2217 as we go to maximal skewness)\nand fixed t, we can plot this ratio as a function of \u03be which is done in Figure 6. Indeed near maximal skewness, there\nis a drop (\u223c 10\u00d7) in \u03b4 and consequently we expect a rapid rise in the distribution since (rather suddenly) the wave\nfunctions aren't as stressed.\nThe arguments presented above have been general for power-law wave functions and so aptly apply to the Hulth\u00e9n\nmodel wave function as well. We can find the SPD's for the Hulth\u00e9n model by inserting \u03c8H into equation 14. At the\nmoderate momentum transfer of 1 GeV2 the bimodality is visible in the \u03be = 0.15 slice of the SPD, see Figure 7. The\npeaks are not quite so distinct since the Hulth\u00e9n wave function isn't as narrowly peaked about x = 1/2 compared to the\nWick-Cutkosky. Consequently distinguishability between contributions from \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 diminishes.

Figure 8 plots the SPD at |t| = 20 GeV2 which matches up\nto the Wick-Cutkosky SPD (Figure 5) in every detail. At 20 GeV2 , the maximal skewness is \u03bem \u2248 0.77. In the plot,\nwe have shown the full range of \u03be. The bimodality is still visible for \u03be < 1/3 but the scale is dominated by the rise\ntoward maximal skewness. We ran into to this in the Wick-Cutkosky model (and was the reason we previously used the\nlogarithmic scale in Figure 5). Taking our focus away from the bimodal peaks, we see the distribution rises (\u223c 5\u00d7) as\n\u03be approaches maximal skewness even against the competing prefactor 1 \u2212 \u03be 2 . The power-law Hulth\u00e9n wave function is\nclearly recovering from being stressed as we approach maximal skewness.\nFinally we must remark, the altered view of Figure 8 not only allows us to view the bimodality more clearly, it also\nhides a feature of in our model wave function! If we could look into the large x shadows in Figure 8, we would notice\na striking asymmetry present even at \u03be = 0. The cross section shown in Figure 9 highlights this feature. This built-in\nasymmetry persists in the SPD for \u03be 6= 0 [30]. Recall that the SPD at \u03be = 0 gives the un-x-integrated electromagnetic\nform factor. In light of our previous work with the Hulth\u00e9n model form factor [26], we readily interpret the asymmetry\nas due to factorization breaking present in this model. The dominant contribution to the electromagnetic form factor\nin asymptopia comes from a peak in the near end-point region (x . 1) and dominates the contribution from the peak\nat x = 1/2 by a factor of ln |t|. As |t| is increased the asymmetry shown in Figure 9 will develop into a strong peak in\nthe near end-point region giving rise to the logarithmic modification to the form factor.\nOf course logarithmic, asymptotic modifications to the form factor are also present for the Wick-Cutkosky model\n[31]. One finds a near end-point asymmetry for the Wick-Cutkosky SPD as well, however, due to the value of model\nparameter chosen (a = 0.08), one must go to considerably high momentum transfer (|t|/m2 \u223c 105 ) to see this effect.\nHaving visited the power-law, model wave functions, we must come full circle. What about the Gaussian wave\nfunction we initially considered? We must remark that the logic leading to Eq. (20) depends crucially on the fact that\nthe wave functions have power-law momentum dependence. Thus arguments about transversely stressed wave functions\nsimply do not apply and we cannot gain intuition about the SPD's amplitude. Moreover (owing to the peculiar nature of\nGaussians) taking the convolution of two Gaussian wave functions yields another Gaussian wave function (certainly with\n9\n\n\f2\n1.5\n1\n\nt2 SPD (GeV4 )\n\n0.5\n10\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n0.4 x\n\n0.4\n\u03be\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\nFigure 8: Skewed parton distribution for the Hulth\u00e9n model plotted for |t| = 20 GeV2 .

The factorization\nviolating peak has already started to develop (manifesting itself as an asymmetry).\n\na different effective plus-momentum, but a Gaussian nonetheless). Thus bimodality (which was due to the individual\nnature of \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2217 ) must disappear. Moreover, at large momentum transfer, we do not see an amplification of the SPD\nnear maximal skewness. On the contrary, the Gaussian SPD's are suppressed. Indeed the behavior of Gaussian wave\nfunctions is peculiar (not just due to unimodality). Luckily we have a wealth of intuition about power-law wave functions\nand thus our understanding of the structure of skewed parton distributions need not remain cloudy. The amplification\n(with \u03be) of the SPD is a possible signature for power-law dependence. Physical observables (the deeply virtual Compton\nscattering cross section, for example) depend on weighted x-integrals of the SPD. Thus maximal skewness amplification\ncould be canceled by compensating behavior in the other kinematical r\u00e9gimes.\n\n5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAbove we have derived the form of the skewed parton distribution in terms of two-body light-front wave functions in\nthe region x > \u03be. We then used model wave functions in order to explore the resulting distributions and gain intuition\nabout their structure. The key results are: Eq. (14), that the use of power-law wave functions leads to skewed parton\ndistributions with two peaks, that factorization of F (x, \u03be = 0, t) of into separate functions of x and t does not hold, and\nfinally Eq.(20). This last item gives F (x, \u03be, t) for very large values of t in terms of quark distribution amplitudes and\nperturbative wave functions. Thus SPD's give a new way to investigate perturbative treatments.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was funded by the U. S. Department of Energy, grant: DE-FG03 \u2212 97ER41014.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.

Since the peak comes\nfrom logarithmic modifications present for this model in asymptopia, we must reason that for lower transverse\nmomentum flow the violation will be less. But this is precisely what happens as we increase \u03be- less transversal\nmomentum flows through the wave functions due to the \u03be dependence of \u2206\u22a5 . That means factorization breaking\npresent in these models has nothing to do with the amplification of the SPD as we approach maximal skewness\n(cf. Figure 5 where no factorization breaking is discernable but maximal skewness amplification certainly occurs).\n[31] V. A. Karmanov and A. V. Smirnov, Nucl. Phys.
