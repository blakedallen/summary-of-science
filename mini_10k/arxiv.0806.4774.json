The starting\npoint in setting up this formalism is the completeness\nrelation\nZ\nZ\nA(a, b; t) =\ndq1 * * * dqN \u22121\n\u00d7 A(a, q1 ; \u03b5) * * * A(qN \u22121 , b; \u03b5) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b5 = t/N denotes the time-slice width. To leading\norder in \u03b5 the short-time transition amplitude reads in\nnatural units\nA(qn , qn+1 ; \u03b5) =\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(qn+1 \u2212 qn )2\n=\n\u2212 \u03b5V (xn ) , (2)\nexp \u2212\n2\u03b5\n(2\u03c0\u03b5)d/2\nwhere the potential V is evaluated at the mid-point coordinate xn = (qn + qn+1 )/2. Substituting (2) in the\ncompleteness relation (1), the deviation of the obtained\ndiscrete amplitude from the continuum result turns out\nto be of the order O(\u03b5). This slow convergence to the\ncontinuum is the major reason for the low efficiency of\nthe ubiquitous Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations [5],\nespecially in numeric studies of Bose-Einstein condensation phenomena [6, 7, 8], quantum phase transitions and\nphase diagrams at low temperatures [9, 10]. Thus, in\norder to accelerate numerical calculations for statistical\nproperties of quantum systems, it is indispensable to develop more efficient algorithms. The existence of such\nalgorithms has been established recently [11].\nTo this end we worked out and numerically verified in\na series of recent papers [12, 13, 14, 15] an efficient analytical procedure for improving the convergence of path\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\u2020 Home\n\nantun@phy.bg.ac.yu\npage: http://scl.phy.bg.ac.yu/\n\nintegrals for single-particle transition amplitudes to the\norder O(\u03b5p ) for arbitrary values of p. This was achieved\nby studying how discretizations of different coarseness\nare related to a hierarchy of effective discrete-time actions which improve the convergence in a systematic way.\nIn Ref. [16] we presented an equivalent approach which\nis based on a direct path-integral calculation of intermediate time amplitudes to the order O(\u03b5p ). The inherent\nsimplicity of these direct calculations made it possible\nto extend the procedure to general many-body theories\nin arbitrary dimension and to obtain explicit results for\nthe effective actions up to level p = 5. It turned out\nthat increasing p leads to an exponential rise in complexity of the effective actions which, ultimately, limits\nthe maximal value of p one can practically work with.\nThese limitations of existing approaches, in particular\nin the case of many-body theories, are still below the\ncalculational barrier stemming from this rise in complexity. This is a strong indication that new and more efficient calculational schemes must exist which should considerably improve the convergence of path integrals for\ngeneral many-body theories. The availability of analytic\nexpressions for higher p effective actions is essential for\nnumerical calculations of path integrals with high precision. Obtaining the information on energy spectra is\njust one important example of calculations that require\nhigh-precision numerical results. Furthermore, since the\nstructure of higher order terms of effective actions is governed by the quantum dynamics of the system, it can be\nused for extracting analytical information about the system properties.\nAs is well known, in concrete calculations it is always easier to solve the underlying Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nthan to directly evaluate the corresponding path integral. For instance, in the case of particular potentials\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation approach allows an efficient recursive scheme to calculate perturbation series up to very\nhigh orders [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. With this in mind, we\ndevelop in the present paper a new and more efficient\nrecursive approach for deriving the short-time transition\namplitude from the underlying Schr\u00f6dinger equation. To\nthis end we proceed as follows. Section 2 presents the\n\n\f2\ninstructive case of a single one-dimensional particle moving in a general potential. The maximal level obtained\nby the new method is p = 35, and thus compares favorably with the best result p = 9 of previous approaches.\nIn Section 3 we focus on the restricted problem of evaluating the velocity independent part of the discrete-time\neffective potential. We derive the differential equations\nfor the velocity independent effective potential of a single one-dimensional particle and solve them for the case\nof a general potential up to level p = 37. Section 4 extends the results of Section 2 to the case of a general\nmany-body theory in d dimensions. We derive the differential equations for the general many-body effective\npotential and solve them up to level p = 10. Both the\nequations and their solution are presented in Section 5\nin a diagrammatic form which is similar to the recursive\ngraphical construction of Feynman diagrams worked out\nin the series [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. With this we illustrate the inherent combinatoric nature of determining the\ndiscrete-time effective potential. The growing number of\ndiagrams with level p leads to an increasing complexity\nof the expression for the discrete-time effective potential.\nWe end by commenting on how this growth in complexity\nlimits maximal attainable values of p. Throughout the\npaper we describe some important envisaged applications\nof the derived discretized effective actions for calculating\nstatistical properties of relevant quantum systems. These\napplications include not only numerical calculations but\nalso a new analytical approximation scheme which was\nmade possible through the availability of high level effective actions.\nII.\n\nwhere we have introduced V\u00b1 = V (x \u00b1 x\u0304) as an abbreviation. Their solution may be written in the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n1\nexp \u2212 x\u03042 \u2212 \u03b5W (x, x\u0304; \u03b5) ,\nA= \u221a\n\u03b5\n2\u03c0\u03b5\n\nwhere the effective potential W (x, x\u0304; \u03b5) is an even function of x\u0304 due to the symmetry (3) of the Euclidean transition amplitude. Note that Eq. (2) represents an approximation to the exact form (9) up to order O(\u03b5). Substituting (9) in (7) and (8) yields\n\u2202W\n\u2202W\n1\n1\n+\u03b5\n\u2212 \u03b5 \u2202 2 W \u2212 \u03b5 \u2202 \u03042 W\n\u2202 x\u0304\n\u2202\u03b5\n8\n8\n1 2\n1 2  \u0304 2\n1\n2\n+ \u03b5 (\u2202W ) + \u03b5 (\u2202W ) = (V+ + V\u2212 ) , (10)\n8\n8\n2\n1\n1 2\n1\n \u0304\n \u0304\nx\u0304 \u2202W \u2212 \u03b5 \u2202 \u2202W + \u03b5 \u2202W \u2202W = (V+ \u2212 V\u2212 ) . (11)\n4\n4\n2\n\nW + x\u0304\n\nBoth partial differential equations determine the effective potential W (x, x\u0304; \u03b5) and thus the transition amplitude A(q, q \u2032 ; \u03b5). The initial condition (6) implies that W\nis regular in the vicinity of \u03b5 = 0, i.e. it may be expanded\nin a power series in \u03b5. We are interested in using W to\nsystematically speed up the convergence of discrete amplitudes with N time slices to the continuum limit. This\nis done by evaluating W to higher powers in \u03b5. According\nto Eq. (2) the dominant term for the short-time propagation is the diffusion relation x\u03042 \u221d \u03b5. Therefore, we\nexpand W in a double power series in both \u03b5 and x\u03042 :\n\nONE PARTICLE IN ONE DIMENSION\n\nW (x, x\u0304; \u03b5) =\nWe start with calculating the transition amplitude\nA(q, q \u2032 ; \u03b5) for one particle in one dimension.

The second recursion relation turns\nout to be more difficult to solve to higher orders as it\ndirectly determines not the coefficients cm,k (x) but their\nfirst derivatives. For this reason we restrict ourselves in\nthe remainder of this section to the recursion relation following from Eq. (10).

For a\ngiven value of m, the coefficients cm,k for k = 0, 1, . . . , m\nare determined as follows. The diagonal coefficient cm,m\nis directly given by (13), whereas the off-diagonal coefficients cm,k follow recursively from evaluating (14) for\nk = m \u2212 1, . . . , 1, 0.

We have automatized this procedure and\nimplemented it using the Mathematica 6.0 package [28]\nfor symbolic calculus. Using this we determined the effective action for a one-dimensional particle in a general\npotential up to the level p = 35. Although the effective\nactions grow in complexity with level p, the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation method for calculating the discrete-time effective actions turns out to be extremely efficient. The ultimate value of p = 35 far surpasses the previously obtained best result of p = 9, and is only limited by the\n\n3\n...\nm\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n...\n\nk\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Order in which the coefficients cm,k are\ncalculated. Diagonal ones follow from Eq. (13), off-diagonal\nones from the recursion relation (14).\n\nsheer size of the expression for the effective action of a\ngeneral theory at such a high level.\nThe whole technique can be pushed much further when\nworking on specific potential classes. For example, for a\nparticle moving in a quartic potential we have obtained\neffective actions up to p = 140. Similar levels have been\nachieved for higher-order polynomial potentials. The increase in level and the decrease in size of the expressions\nfor the effective actions originate from functional relations between the potential and its derivatives. These\nrelations are particularly simple in the case of polynomial interactions where all the derivatives of the potential above a certain degree vanish. However, the benefits\nof working within a specific class of potentials are not\nonly limited to polynomial interactions. For example, the\nfunctional relations for the modified P\u00f6schl-Teller potential have allowed us to obtain effective actions up to level\np = 40 [29].\nAs already stated, the principal rationale behind constructing high-level effective actions is to use them for\nspeeding up Monte Carlo calculations. However, having\nobtained explicit expressions for effective actions to such\nhigh levels, it now becomes possible to use them extensively in both numerical and analytical calculations. In\nparticular, having obtained an extremely precise knowledge of the short-time propagation of a system, it is possible to use standard resummation techniques such as the\nPad\u00e9 and the Borel method to extract useful information\nabout its behavior for long propagation times.\nThe derived effective actions can also be applied to\nsystematically improve the Numerical Matrix Diagonalization (NMD) method [30, 31, 32] for calculating energy\neigenvalues and eigenstates. Note that the propagation\ntime t used in the NMD method is just a parameter which\nis chosen in such a way that it minimizes the error associated with the calculated energy eigenvalues. Therefore, it\nis always possible to select this parameter to be small, so\nthat the obtained expansion of the ideal effective action\ncan be used to substantially improve NMD calculations.\n\n\f4\nFurthermore, in this case we can even use analytic N = 1\napproximation for the path integral. In this approximation there are no integrals to perform in Eq. (1) and the\namplitude is directly given by the analytic expression (9).\nUsing such extremely rough discretizations is only possible if one has determined the ideal effective action to\nvery high orders p. In effect, one compensates without\nloss of precision the increase of discretization coarseness\nwith the input of new analytical information concerning\nthe propagation time which is contained in the effective\naction. In this way, without any integration or resummation techniques, we can calculate large number of highly\naccurate energy eigenvalues, avoiding the usually needed\nlimit t \u2192 \u221e which is difficult to approach. The large\nnumber of precise energy eigenvalues obtained by using\nthis improved NMD method allows for calculating amplitudes for longer propagation times using the spectral\ndecomposition. This also makes it possible to calculate\npartition functions as well as global, local, and bilocal\ndensities of states or other relevant statistical quantities\nwith high accuracy.\n\nyields the equation for W0 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5\n\u2202W0\n\u2202W0 +\n8\u2202\n\u2212 8W0 \u2202W0 + 8V \u2202W0 \u2212 \u2202 3 W0 (24)\n4\n\u2202\u03b5\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n\u2202W0\n\u03b53\n\u03b5\n8 \u2202W0\n\u2212 3\u2202W0 \u2202 2 W0 \u2212\n(\u2202W0 )3 = \u2202V .\n\u2212\n4\n\u2202\u03b5\n4\nThis is solved in the form of the power series\nW0 (x; \u03b5) =\n\nThe velocity independent part of the effective potential W0 (x; \u03b5) \u2261 W (x, 0; \u03b5) determines diagonal transition\namplitudes.

This object is also much simpler than the full W . In addition,\nthe relation between V and W0 allows us to visualize the\neffects of quantization and discretization for a given potential. In this section we derive the differential equation\nfor W0 for a single particle moving in one dimension.\nBoth Eqs. (7) and (8) contain derivatives with respect\nto x\u0304, so it is impossible to set x\u0304 = 0 and obtain equations\nfor W0 . However, differentiating Eq.

Note that the diagrammatic notation reveals the fact that, as far as the shorttime expansion is concerned, all systems fall into one of\ntwo classes of complexity depending on the value of the\nproduct dM . Discrete-time effective potentials for systems with dM > 1 grow faster in complexity with increasing p than their dM = 1 analogues, as illustrated\nin Fig. 2. The reason for this is that several distinct\ndiagrams collapse into a single term in the case of one\nparticle in one dimension. Symbolical algebraic calculations for dM > 1 effective actions were done using the\nprogram [29] written in Mathematica 6.0 in conjunction\nwith the MathTensor package [33]. Using this program,\nfor a general many-body theory we have derived analytic\nexpressions for effective actions up to level p = 10.\nAs in the case of one-dimensional systems, the obtained\ndiscretized effective actions can be applied to a host of\nrelevant physical many-body problems in the framework\nof the Path Integral Monte Carlo approach, including the\ncontinuous-space worm algorithm [34]. For instance, our\napproach is applicable to efficiently determine the statistical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates which are\nconfined in harmonic or anharmonic traps [35, 36, 37, 38].\n\n1e+07\n1e+06\n100000\n10000\n1000\n\nFurthermore, our method is ideally suited for dealing\nwith dilute quantum gases in a disorder environment\nwhere the impact of two-particle interactions upon the\nrecently discovered phenomenon of Anderson localization\nis at present studied [39, 40].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have given a detailed presentation of an analytic\nprocedure for determining the short-time propagation of\na general non-relativistic M -particle theory in d dimensions to extremely high orders. The procedure is based\non recursively solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the\ntransition amplitude in a power series of the propagation time. This leads to a new recursion relation that\nhas been solved to order p = 10 for the case of a general\nmany-body theory. For a single particle moving in a general potential in d = 1 we have even achieved p = 35. In\naddition, for specific classes of potentials as, for instance,\npolynomial potentials, the equations have been solved to\norder p = 140. The resulting Schwinger-Dyson equation\nand its recursive solution have also been cast both in a\nfamiliar diagrammatic and a compact topological notation. The presented results define the state-of-the-art for\ncalculating short-time expansion amplitudes. They can\nbe used to obtain orders of magnitude speedup in Path\nIntegral Monte Carlo calculations. Thus, the extremely\nhigh orders of the short-time expansion make it possible to perform new and precise analytical calculations\nof thermodynamical and dynamical properties of manybody systems. A list of applications of the presented\nmethod to relevant physical systems is briefly outlined.\n\n100\n\ndM > 1, all\ndM = 1, all\ndM = 1,\uf8e5x = 0\n\n10\n1\n1\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nAcknowledgements\n40\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The number of diagrams contributing\nto a given level illustrates the rise in complexity with increasing p. Systems fall into one of two classes of complexity: the\nmore complex ones with dM > 1 (top curve) and the less\ncomplex ones with dM = 1 (middle curve). In addition, the\nbottom curve gives the number of velocity independent diagrams for dM = 1.\n\nWe thank Barry Bradlyn for carefully reading the\nmanuscript.
