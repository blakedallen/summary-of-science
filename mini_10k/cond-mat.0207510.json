The size can be characterized by\nthe number, N , of the amino acids that the protein is\nmade of. The distribution of N across proteins stored\nin the data banks is peaked around N =100 (Cieplak &\nHoang, 2000) and all proteins with a large N , like titin\n(N \u2248 30 000), consist of many domains. There must be\nthen a mechanism that prevents globular proteins from\nreaching much larger sizes. We have argued (Cieplak &\nHoang, 2000) that this is provided by the function of the\n\nA simple parameter that is used to characterize the structure of the protein is the relative contact order, CO,\n(Plaxco et al., 1998) defined as average sequence distance between two aminoacids that interact with each\nother, i.e. form a contact, in the native state:\nP\ni<j\u22121 \u2206ij |i \u2212 j|\nP\nCO =\n,\n(1)\nN i<j\u22121 \u2206ij\n\nwhere \u2206ij is 0 if the amino acids i and j do not form\na contact and 1 otherwise. The relative contact order\nparameter is small for \u03b1- proteins in which all secondary\nstructures consist of the \u03b1-helices because the hydrogen\nbonds in the helices correspond to |i \u2212 j| = 4. On the\nother hand, \u03b2-proteins tend to have larger CO because\nthe \u03b2 strands that form a sheet often involve amino acids\nwhich are quite distant along a sequence.\nIn their seminal 1998 paper (Plaxco et al., 1998) (paper\nI), Plaxco, Baker, and Simons have argued that folding\nrates correlate with CO but do not with N . Their argument was based on analysing experimental data on short\nproteins that were available in the literature. Their conclusion was reinforced in the 2000 paper (Plaxco et al.,\n2000) (paper II) by Plaxco, Simons, Ruczinski, and Baker\nin which the compilation of the kinetic data involved a\nlarger set of proteins, including those that were considered in paper I. The later data were also restricted to a\nmuch narrower temperature range of between 20 and 25\no\nC. Their results for the folding times (i.e. the inverses of\nthe folding rates) are represented in Figure 1 as a function of N (on the logarithmic scale). For the purpose of\nfurther discussion, we have divided the data into three\nclasses: \u03b1-proteins, \u03b2-proteins, and \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins. The\n\u03b1-proteins are easily seen to be the fastest folders but\nclearly all of the data points are scattered all over the\nplane of the figure.\nThis random looking pattern of the data may, however,\nbe only apparent since the plot might involve mixing distinct classes of proteins that perhaps should not be compared together. Figure 2 indeed hints at such a possibility as the splitting into the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b1\u2013\u03b2- structural\nclasses reveals some patterns. These patterns are shown\nin different time windows \u2013 the \u03b1-proteins are in the window of much shorter times. There is a growing trend for\nthe \u03b2- proteins and, if one disregards one outlayer, also\n\n\ffor the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins. The data for the \u03b1-proteins, however, are puzzling since if they do show an overall trend\nthen it would be downwards, i.e. the bigger the N , the\nshorter the folding time which defies a common simple\nexpectation to observe the opposite.\nThe combined data show a strong correlation with the\nCO parameter. When the data are split into the three\nstructural classes, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 2, then the correlation remains strong for the \u03b1- and\n\u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins. However, in the crucial test case of the\n\u03b2-proteins (the right-bottom panel of Figure 2) four proteins have nearly the same CO and yet substantially different folding times. Thus there are some unsettling issues in our understanding of the experimental data that\nwould be desirable to solve.\nTheoretical modeling in simplified models, despite its\nwell known general shortcomings, is expected to be a tool\nof help to identify possible trends because a unified approach can be applied to many different proteins. In this\npaper, we consider 51 proteins: 21 of the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 kind with\nN between 29 and 162, 14 of the \u03b1-proteins with N between 35 and 154, and 16 \u03b2-proteins with N between 36\nand 124. This set contains the 21 proteins, used in Figures 1 and 2, that were considered by Plaxco et al. All of\nthe 51 proteins are modelled in three different ways and\nstudied by the techniques of molecular dynamics. Even\nthough the three models are all coarse grained and of the\nGo type (Abe & Go, 1981; Takada, 1999) they have very\ndifferent kinetic and equilibrium properties when used for\na particular protein. The variations between the models\ndo lead to some differences in scaling properties of certain parameters, such as the temperature of the fastest\nfolding, Tmin , or the thermodynamic stability temperature, Tf , but they all agree on a power law dependence\nof the folding time, tf old , on N\ntf old \u223c N \u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nand on the lack of any correlation of tf old with CO. The\nproblems with the experimental results on the N dependence may be related to the lack of the temperature optimization. The folding time often depends on the temperature, T , and making choices on the temperature to\nstudy kinetics may affect the outcome of the measurement. We argue that a demonstrable trend might arise\nwhen all data are collected at Tmin which needs to be\ndetermined for each protein individually.\nThe theoretically derived lack of correlation of tf old with\nCO seems to be a more difficult issue. One may just dismiss it as characterizing not real life but an approximate\nmodel. On the other hand, the essence of the Go models\nis that they are based on the native topology. Thus if\nsuch geometry sensitive models do not 'care' about the\n\ncontact order then what models would? We leave it as\nan open question and this paper may be just considered\nto be a report on what are the properties of three different Go-like models. Notice, however, that once a Go\nmodel is constructed its contacts are well defined and the\nkinetics are studied in the context of such a definition\nwhereas assignment of contacts in experimental systems\nis subjective. It should be pointed out that the contact\norder in the Go models is actually quite important but\nnot for the overall folding time \u2013 it is the primary factor that governs the succession of events during folding\n(Unger, 1996; Hoang & Cieplak, 2000a; Hoang & Cieplak,\n2000b; Cieplak et al., 2002a; Cieplak et al., 2002b; Erman, 2001). In other words, what is important for folding\nof a protein is the full \"spectrum\" of the relevant values\nof the sequence distances |i\u2212j| and not just their average\nvalue. A similar point has been argued within a host of\nmodels in references (Galzitskaya and Finkelstein, 1999;\nAlm and Baker, 1999; Munoz and Eaton, 1999; Du et al.,\n1999; and Plotkin and Onuchic, 2000).\nThe power law dependence described by eq. 2 has been\nproposed by Thirumalai (Thirumalai, 1995) and then\ndemonstrated explicitly for several types of lattice models (Gutin et al., 1996; Zhdanov, 1998; Cieplak et al.,\n1999). On the other hand, a number of theories and a\nrecent simulation of 18 proteins (away from the optimal\nfolding condition) by Koga and Takada (Koga & Takada,\n2001) suggest a power law dependence for barrier heights\non N and hence an exponential dependence of tf old on\nN (Takada & Wolynes, 1997; Finkelstein & Badredtinov,\n1997; Wolynes, 1997). Thus the issue of scaling remains\nunsettled not only experimentally but also theoretically.\nRecently (Cieplak & Hoang, 2001) we have demonstrated\nthe power law dependence for one variant (of the three\nstudied here) Go-like models when applied to 21 proteins which were mostly of the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 kind. The resulting\nexponent \u03bb turned out to be equal to 2.5 \u00b1 0.2. In this\nparticular variant of the Go model, the native contact\ninteractions were restricted to a cut-off value of 7.5\u00c5 and\nthe contact potential was described by the Lennard-Jones\nform.\nHere, we extend such studies to the other two kinds of\nproteins, \u03b1 and \u03b2, and arrive at a similar value of \u03bb. However, when the model is made significantly more realistic\nby considering the range of the native contact interactions as a variable quantity, then we arrive at a richer\npicture. We show that the three classes of tertiary structures also correspond to three different kinetic universality classes. The \u03b1-proteins come with \u03bb of around 1.7\n(the result obtained previously (Cieplak & Hoang, 2001)\nfor decoy helical structures), the \u03b2-proteins are characterized by \u03bb close to 3.2, and the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins have \u03bb near\n2.5. These values do not depend on whether the contact\npotential are Lennard-Jones or of the 10\u201312 form so they\n\n\fare truly a reflection of the native topology. The power\nlaw trends are pretty evident when the folding times are\ndetermined at Tmin but harder to see otherwise. In these\nstudies, the range of the contact interactions has been determined based on the van der Waals radii of the atoms\n(Tsai et al., 1999). Another realistic item that we implement is the chirality potential \u2013 a term which is responsible for folding to a conformation of the correct native\nchirality. This term affects the kinetics but we show it\nnot to affect values of the exponent \u03bb.\nThe growth of tf old with N indicates increasingly deteriorating folding conditions. Our studies of scaling of Tmin\nand Tf indicate that asymptotically Tf becomes substantially lower than Tmin which signifies an onset of slow\nglassy kinetics before the system is near the native conformation. This adds to the deterioration of foldability\nand suggests the limitation in the observed values of N .\nThe three models considered here have Tmin and Tf varying as a function of N in different ways, though they agree\nasymptotically. Among the three models, the LennardJones contact potential with the variable Rc appears to\nhave the most appealing kinetic properties in that it leads\nto a very good foldability for a small N . This should be\nour simple model of choice in future studies. However,\nthe issue of the scaling trends needs now to be studied in\nmodels that reach beyond the Go approximation and in\nexperiments with a protocol that involves optimization.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA. The Hamiltonian\nAn input for the construction of the Go model is a\nPDB file (Bernstein et al., 1977) with the coordinates\nof all atoms in the native conformation. The coordinates are used to determine the length related parameters of the model. Whereas all energy and temperature related parameters are expressed in terms of a\ncommon unit \u2013 \u01eb. We model 51 proteins. In addition to the proteins listed in the caption of Figure 1,\nwe also consider 1cti(29), 1cmr(31), 1erc(40), 1crn(46),\n7rxn(52), 5pti(58), 1tap(60), 1aho(64), 1ptx(64),\n1erg(70), 102l(162) which are of the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 type, or unstructured, then 1ce4(35), 1bba(36), 1bw6(56), 1rpo(61),\n1hp8(68), 1ail(73), 1ycc(103) which are of the \u03b1 type,\nand 1cbh(36), 1ixa(39), 1ed7(45), 1bq9(53), 2cdx(60),\n2ait(74), 1bdo(80), 1wit(93), 1who(94), 6pcy(99),\n1ksr(100), 4fgf(124) which are of the \u03b2 type. The symbols\nare the PDB codes and the numbers in brackets indicate\nthe corresponding value of N . The choice of these proteins was motivated by their size but otherwise random.\nWe consider several variants of the Go models. In each\ncase, the Hamiltonian consists of the kinetic energy and\nof the potential energy, Ep ({ri }), which is given by\n\nEp ({ri }) = V BB + V N AT + V N ON + V CHIR .\n(3)\nThe first term, V BB is the harmonic potential\nV BB =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n1\nk(ri,i+1 \u2212 d0 )2 ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhich tethers consecutive beads at the equilibrium bond\nlength, d0 , of 3.8\u00c5. Here, ri,i+1 = |ri \u2212 ri+1 | is the distance between the consecutive beads and k = 100\u01eb/\u00c52,\nwhere \u01eb is the characteristic energy parameter corresponding to a native contact.\nThe native contacts are defined either through the distances between the C\u03b1 atoms or through an all-tom consideration. The first choice, used by us previously (Hoang\n& Cieplak, 2000a; Hoang & Cieplak, 2000b; Cieplak &\nHoang, 2001), is to take a uniform cut-off distance, Rc ,\nof 7.5\u00c5, below which a contact is said to be present. In\nthe second choice, used here in most cases, all the heavy\natoms present in the PDB file are taken into account.\nSpecifically, a pair of aminoacids is considered to form a\ncontact if any pair of their non-hydrogen atoms have a\nnative separation which is smaller than 1.244 (Ri + Rj ),\nwhere Ri are the van der Waals radii of atom i, as listed\nin ref. (Tsai et al., 1999). This critical separation corresponds to the point of inflection of the Lennard-Jones\npotential. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the effective contact ranges as obtained for an N =162 protein\nT4 lysozyme with the PDB code 102l which consists of\n10 \u03b1-helices and 3 \u03b2-strands. There are 339 native contacts in this case and they range in value between 4.36\nand 12.80 \u00c5. It is clear that truncating this distribution\nat whatever \"reasonable\" value, which is often taken to\nbe in the range between 6.5 and 8.5 \u00c5 would result in\na substantial removal of the relevant interactions. Thus\ninsisting on a uniform cutoff value is expected to have\nnoticeable dynamical effect.\nWe consider two variants of the interactions in the native\ncontacts. The first variant is the 6\u201312 Lennard-Jones\npotential\n\"\u0012\n\u001312 \u0012\n\u00136 #\nN\nAT\nX\n\u03c3ij\n\u03c3ij\nN AT\n,\n(5)\n\u2212\n4\u01eb\nV6\u221212 =\nrij\nrij\ni<j\nwhere the sum is taken over all native contacts. The parameters \u03c3ij are chosen so that each contact in the native\nstructure is stabilized at the minimum of the potential,\nand \u03c3 \u2261 5\u00c5 is a typical value. The second variant is the\n10\u201312 potential\n\uf8ee\n!\n! \uf8f9\n(n) 12\n(n) 10\nN\nAT\nX\nr\nr\nij\nij\nN AT\n\uf8fb,\n\u01eb\uf8f0 5\n(6)\n\u22126\nV10\u221212\n=\nr\nr\nij\nij\ni<j\n\n\f(n)\n\nwhere rij coincides with the native distance. This potential is frequently used to describe hydrogen bonds\n(Clementi et al., 2000). For each pair of interacting\namino acids, the two potentials have a minimum energy\nof \u2212\u01eb and are cut off at 20\u00c5. The non-native interactions, V N ON , are purely repulsive and are necessary to\nreduce the effects of entanglements. They are taken as\nthe repulsive part of the Lennard-Jones potential that\ncorresponds to the minimum occurring at 5\u00c5. This potential is truncated at the minimum and shifted upward\nso that it reaches zero energy at the point of truncation.\nThe final term in the Hamiltonian takes into account the\nchirality. Natural proteins have right handed helices but\na Go model as described above involves chiral frustration:\none end of a helix may want to fold into a right handed\nhelix and another into a left handed one and \"convincing\"\none end to agree with the twist of the other takes time\nand delays folding. Such a frustration would not arise\nnaturally. In order to prevent it, we add a term which\nfavors the native sense of the overall chirality at each\nlocation along the backbone. A chirality of residue i is\ndefined as\nCi =\n\n(vi\u22121 \u00d7 vi ) * vi+1\n,\nd30\n\n(7)\n\nwhere vi = ri+1 \u2212 ri . A positive Ci corresponds to righthanded chirality. Otherwise the chirality is left-handed.\nThe values of Ci are essentially between \u22121 and +1. The\ndistribution of Ci in 21 \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins considered in this\nstudy is shown in Figure 4. It is seen to be bimodal. The\nvalues in the higher peak correspond to locations within\nthe helical secondary structures. The chiral part of the\nHamiltonian is then given phenomenologically by\nV CHIR =\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\ni=2\n\n1\n\u03ba Ci2 \u0398(\u2212CiN AT ),\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u0398 is the step function (1 for positive arguments\nand zero otherwise), CiN AT is the chirality of residue i in\nthe native conformation, and \u03ba is taken, in most cases,\nto be equal to \u01eb. However, a criterion for selection of its\nproper value remains to be elucidated. The idea behind\nthis particular form of V CHIR is that when the local chirality agrees with the native chirality then there is no\neffect on the energy. On the other hand, a disagreement\nin the chirality is is punished by a cost which is quadratic\nin chirality.\nV CHIR has the strongest effect on the helical structures.\nHowever, it affects the sense of a twist of the whole tertiary structure. The chirality term enhances the dynamical bias towards the native structure during the folding\nprocess and helps avoiding non-physical conformations\nsuch as left-handed helices. V CHIR is a four-body potential. In this respect this term is similar to potentials that\n\ninvolve dihedral angles (Veitshans et al., 1997; Clementi\net al., 2000; Settanni et al., 2002). The dihedral terms\nenhance stability of a model of the protein but usually\nhave no bearing on the chirality (Veitshans et al., 1997)\nunless they involve directly the values of native dihedral\nangles (Clementi et al., 2000; Settanni et al., 2002).\nB. The time evolution\nThe time evolution of unfolded conformations to the native state is simulated through the methods of molecular\ndynamics as described in details in (Hoang & Cieplak,\n2000a; Hoang & Cieplak, 2000b) (see also (Cieplak et\nal., 2002a; Cieplak et al., 2002b) in the context of the\nLennard-Jones contact potentials. The beads representing the amino acids are coupled to Langevin noise and\ndamping terms to mimic the effect of the surrounding\nsolvent and provide thermostating at a temperature T .\nThe equations of motion for each bead are\nmr\u0308 = \u2212\u03b3 \u1e59 + Fc + \u0393 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the amino acids represented by\neach bead. A similar approach in the context of proteins\nhas also been adopted in references (Guo and Thirumalai, 1996; Berriz et al., 1997; and Eastman and Doniach 1998). The specificity of masses has turned out to\nbe irrelevant for kinetics (Cieplak et al., 2002a) and it is\nsufficient to consider masses that are uniform and equal\nto the average amino acidic mass. Fc is the net force due\nto the molecular potentials and external forces, \u03b3 is the\ndamping constant,\nand \u0393 is a Gaussian noise term with\n\u221a\nthe contact podispersion 2\u03b3kB T . For both kinds of p\ntentials, time is measured in units of \u03c4 \u2261 m\u03c3 2 /\u01eb, where\n\u03c3 is 5\u00c5. This corresponds to the characteristic period of\nundamped oscillations at the bottom of a typical 6\u201312 potential. For the average amino acidic mass and \u01eb of order\n4kcal/mol, \u03c4 is of order 3ps. According to Veitshans et\nal. (Veitshans et al., 1997), realistic estimates of damping by the solution correspond to a value of \u03b3 near 50\nm/\u03c4 . However, the folding times have been found to depend on \u03b3 in a simple linear fashion for \u03b3 > m/\u03c4 (Hoang\n& Cieplak, 2000a; Hoang & Cieplak, 2000b; Klimov &\nThirumalai, 1997). Thus in order to accelerate the simulations, we work with \u03b3 = 2m/\u03c4 but more realistic time\nscales are obtained when the folding times are multiplied\nby 25. The equations of motion are solved by means of\nthe fifth order Gear predictor-corrector algorithm (Gear,\n1971) with a time step of 0.005\u03c4 .\nThe magnitude of the viscous effects, as controlled by\nthe parameter \u03b3, has to be sufficiently large so that the\nscenarios of the folding events are not dominated by the\ninertial effects. Otherwise the scenarios would depend on\nthe spacial and not on the sequencial separation between\nthe amino acids. Figure 5, for crambin as an illustration,\n\n\fshows that even though our value of \u03b3 of 2 is reduced\ncompared to the values that are expected to be realistic it already corresponds to sufficiently strong damping\nwith the minimal inertial effects. Figure 5 gives average\nfirst times needed to establish contacts separated by the\nsequence length |i \u2212 j| for three values of \u03b3: 2, 12, and\n24 m/\u03c4 . To the leading order, the times to establish the\ncontacts (and also the folding times) are linear functions\nof \u03b3 so one can show them together by proper rescaling.\nFurthermore, the whole pattern of the events is insensitive to the value of \u03b3. Starting with this figure, we adopt\nthe convention that the symbol sizes give measures of the\nerror bars in the quantity that is plotted.\nThe folding time is calculated as the median first passage time, i.e. the time needed to arrive in the native\nconformation from an unfolded conformation. It is estimated based on between 101 and 201 trajectories. Tmin\nis defined as a temperature at which tf old has a minimum value when plotted vs. T . For small values N , the\nU-shaped dependence of tf old on N may be very broad\nand then Tmin is defined as the position of the center of\nthe U-shaped curve. The simplified criterion for an arrival in the native conformation to be declared is based\non a simplified approach in which a protein is considered\nfolded if all beads that form a native contact are within\n(n)\nthe cutoff distance of 1.5\u03c3ij or 1.2rij for the 6\u201312 and\n10\u201312 potentials respectively.\nThe stability temperature Tf is determined through the\nnearly equilibrium calculation of the probability that the\nprotein has all of its native contacts established. Tf is\nthe temperature at which this probability crosses 12 . The\ncalculation is based on least 5 long trajectories that start\nin the native state in order to make sure that the system is in the right region of the conformation space. It\nshould be noted that, in the literature, the frequently\nused estimate of the folding temperature is determined\nthrough the position of the maximum in the specific heat.\n\u2032\nThis yields a Tf which is typically larger than Tf . Our\nprobabilistic interpretation has the disadvantage of being\ndependent on the precise definition of what constitutes\nthe native basin (and thus only the approximate location of Tf is of relevance) but it has the advantage of\nrelating only to the native basin and not to any other\nvalleys in the phase space. In most of our systems, Tf\nis found to be comparable to Tmin , while both of them\n\u2032\nare always lower than Tf . Furthermore, in most cases,\neven though when Tmin is found to be higher than Tf ,\nthe folding times at Tf are comparable to those at Tmin\nwhich indicates that the model is unfrustrated in the conventional sense. Only in some very few cases, the folding\ntimes at Tf are excessively long to be determined in our\nsimulation. This behaviour probably corresponds to a\nstructural frustration (Clementi et al., 2000) embedded\nin the native conformation.\n\nAn alternative to the contact-based criterion for folding is\nto provide a more precise delineation of the native basin\nas in ref. (Hoang & Cieplak, 2002b) or relate the criterion to a cutoff in the value of the RMSD distance away\nfrom the native conformation. These approaches are illustrated in Figure 6 which shows the dependence of the\nfolding time, tf old , vs. T for a synthetic \u03b1-helix (H16 of\nreference (Hoang & Cieplak, 2002a)) and \u03b2-hairpin (B16\nof the same reference) that both consist of 16 monomers.\nWhichever criterion for folding is used, the folding curves\nare U-shaped and the non-zero chirality term extends\nthe region of the fastest folding both towards the low\nand high temperature ends. For the hairpin, the effect is\nsmaller but still clearly present.\nWhen it comes to model proteins, we used only the\ncontact-based folding criterion. An illustration of the\nrole of the chirality potential is provided in Figure 7 for\ncrambin (N =46, the PDB code 1crn) which is a protein\nof the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 type. The top panel, for Rc = 7.5\u00c5, shows\nthat the shortest time of folding is somewhat reduced by\nV CHIR but the biggest impact is on the range of temperatures at which folding is optimal, almost by the factor of\n2, especially in the low T regime. For the \u03b2 proteins, the\neffect of the chirality potential is generally smaller. For\nthe SH3 domain coded 1efn the change due to V CHIR is\nhard to detect (not shown) but for the I27 globular domain of titin, coded 1tit, it is quite substantial on the low\nT side of the curve (Figure 8). We conclude that incorporation of the chirality term in the Hamiltonian appears\nto reduce structural frustration in these models and thus\nmakes the models more realistic. For all of the results\npresented here from now on (except for Figure 12), the\nchirality term is included.\nAnother simple way to enhance the realism of the Go\nmodels is suggested by Figure 3: calculate the range of\nthe contact potential instead of taking one uniform cutoff\nvalue. When we compare the case of the Lennard-Jones\ncontact potential with the uniform or variable Rc then\nthe nature of the effect on the kinetics strongly depends\non the protein. For instance, for the protein 1crn (Figure\n7, bottom panel) there is essentially no difference. On\nthe other hand, a dramatic narrowing of the U-curve is\nobserved for 1tit (Figure 8).\nOn switching the 6\u201312 potential to the 10\u201312 potential\nall of the kinetic U-curves become substantially narrower\n(Figures 7 and 8). This is related to the fact that the\npotential well corresponding to the 10\u201312 potential is\nnarrower which makes folding a task that requires more\nprecision. Note, that the two potentials have the same\nenergy (\u2212\u01eb) at the minimum so the temperature scale are\ncomparable.\n\n\fWe have demonstrated that there are many ways to construct variants of the Go models and they all come with\ndistinctive folding characteristics.\nRESULTS\nA. The 6\u201312 potential with the variable contact range\nFigure 9 shows the median values of tf old at Tmin for\nthe Lennard-Jones contact potential when the presence\nof the native contact is determined through the van der\nWaals sizes of the atoms (and with the chirality term included). Figure 9 data divides the data into the three\nstructural classes. There are a few outlayers (one is the\n1aps protein which appears to be a poor folder also experimentally) but basically there are clear linear trends\non the log-log scale which indicates validity of the power\nlaw, eq. (2). The values of the exponents 1.7 for the\n\u03b1-proteins and 3.2 for the \u03b2-proteins agree with those\nfound for decoy structures (Cieplak & Hoang, 2001). The\ndecoy structures were constructed from homopolymers\nand the contact range was not variable due to the lack\nof atomic features in the decoys. Figure 10 replots the\nsame data together to indicate that the trends identified\nin the classes are identifiably distinct. Thus the structural classes also correspond to the kinetic universality\nclasses.\nFigure 11 shows data equivalent to those on Figure 9 but\nnow the folding times are determined at Tf , as an example of a situation that may be encountered away from the\noptimal conditions. The data points show a much larger\nscatter away form the trend identified at Tmin . The optimal trend seems still dominant but it is so much harder\nto see. This should be analogous to results obtained experimentally.\nIt is interesting to figure out what is the effect of the chirality potential on the scaling results. Figure 12 refers\nto the \u03b1-proteins and it compares the case of \u03ba = 0 to\n\u03ba = \u01eb. Proteins with small values of N are not sensitive\nto the value of \u03ba but for N >\u2248 50 taking the chirality into account accelerates the kinetics quite noticeably.\nThe 'asymptotic' scaling behavior remains unchanged \u2013\nthe exponent \u03bb of 1.7 is valid for both cases, though a\nsomewhat larger value for \u03ba=0 cannot be ruled out (but\ncertainly not as large as 2.5). We have checked that\nthe data points for \u03ba = 2\u01eb, though corresponding to a\nbit faster times than for \u03ba = \u01eb, are in practice indistinguishable from the latter in the scale of the figure. This\nobservation suggests a behavior which saturates with a\ngrowing \u03ba.\nAs pointed out in Ref. (Cieplak et al., 1999), the dependence of Tf and Tmin on N may offer additional clues\n\nabout the foldability at large N . Figure 13 suggests that\nthe \u03b1- and \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins are excellent folders for small\nvalues of N since then Tmin is less than Tf . Tf appears to have no systematic trend with N but the data\nfor Tmin suggest a weak growth, approximately proportional to log(N ). Around N of 50 the trend associated\nwith Tmin crosses the average value of Tf and from now\non Tf is lower than Tmin . This suggests that asymptotically the energy landscape of the system would be too\nglassy-like to sustain viable folding. Thus accomplishing\nfolding would require breaking into independently folding\ndomains domain or receiving an external assistance, e.g.\nfrom chaperons whereas our studies are concerned with\nindividual proteins. Figure 13 also suggests that the \u03b2\nproteins behave somewhat differently since they exhibit\nno trend in Tmin in the range studied and already for\nsmall values of N Tmin exceeds Tf . Nevertheless the differences between the three structural classes are minor\nbecause they all show a border line behavior: the proteins in the range up to N =162 are not excellent but\njust adequate folders, at least in this model.\nIt is interesting to point out that neither tf old nor the\ncharacteristic temperatures indicate any demonstrable\ncorrelation with the relative contact order defined in eq.\n1. This is shown in Figure 14: for a given value of CO\nwe find systems both with long and short folding times\nor both high and low values of Tmin .\nB. The 10\u201312 potential with the variable contact range\nWe now check the stability of our results against the\nchange in the form of the contact potential with the same\ncharacteristic energy scale. Figure 15 shows that when\nthe Lennard-Jones potential is replaced by the 10\u201312 potential, with keeping all other Hamiltonian parameters\nintact, the scaling trends for Tf old are consistent with\nthose displayed in Figure 9 and confirm the existence of\nthe three universality classes.\nFigure 16 suggests that the 10\u201312 systems are also border line in terms of the positioning of Tmin vs Tf but\nthe weak growing trends for the \u03b1- and \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins are\ngone. The lack of correlations with the relative contact\norder also holds for the 10\u201312 potential (not shown).\nC. The 6\u201312 potential with Rc = 7.5\u00c5\nWe now return to the Lennard-Jones potential and make\nthe drastic, as evidenced by Figure 3, change that only\nthose native contacts are considered whose range does\nnot exceed 7.5\u00c5. The resulting data are shown in Figure\n17. The top panel indicates that \u03bb of about 2.5 is still\nconsistent with the trend obtained. However, \u03bb of 1.7 is\nquite off the mark for the \u03b1-proteins. The exponent of 3.2\nfor the \u03b2-proteins is not ruled out but the scatter in the\n\n\fdata points is bigger than in the bottom panel of Figure\n9. Taken together with the results for the \u03b1-proteins, the\nmost likely conclusion is that the fixed, and invasive, cut\noff in the contact range looses the ability to distinguish\nbetween the structural classes and all such models of the\nproteins would be characterized by a single exponent \u03bb\nof 2.5 as found in ref. (Cieplak & Hoang, 2001). This is\nillustrated in Figure 18 where the data corresponding to\nvarious structural classes are displayed together. They\nseem to be consistent with just one trend.\nFigure 19 shows Tmin and Tf for the case with Rc = 7.5\u00c5.\nIt suggests that among the three models studied here, the\none with the cut off in the contact range is the worst kinetically because the gap between the band of values of\nTmin and the band of values of Tf is the largest. This\nindicates that precise values of the contact range are important in the task of putting pieces of a protein together\nin the folding process. Also in this model, there is no correlation with the relative contact order parameter.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have studied 3 variants of the Go model through the\nmolecular dynamics simulations and demonstrated the\npower law dependence of the folding time on N and lack\nof dependence on CO. Furthermore, the models with the\nvariable contact range allow one to identify (at least)\nthree kinetic universality classes corresponding to three\ndifferent values of the exponent \u03bb. The lowest exponent\nfound for the \u03b1- structures is consistent with the widely\nheld belief that the \u03b1-helices are structures that are optimal kinetically (Micheletti et al., 1999; Maritan et al.,\n2000). The scaling behavior of Tmin and Tf , taken together with the increasing tf old suggests an asymptotic\nemergence of a glassy behavior. As a technical improvement, we have highlighted benefits of introducing the chirality potential.\nRecently, Koga and Takada (Koga & Takada, 2001) have\nalso studied scaling of tf old in proteins approximated by\nthe Go model. They have considered the 10\u201312 potential\nthat was augmented by potentials which involved the dihedral angles (but no chirality). They have determined\nthe folding temperature through the maximum in the\n\u2032\nspecific heat. Their studies at Tf , done for 18 proteins\nwith N in the range between 53 and 153, suggest a tf old\nthat exponentially depends on the relative contact order\nmultiplied by N 0.6 .\nIt is thus interesting to check on this conclusion in the\nframework of our approach. Figure 20 shows log(tf old )\nvs. CO\u00d7N 0.6 for our best model, i.e. for the LennardJones contact potential with variable contact range. It\nis clear that the data at Tmin (the left panels) show significantly less scatter than at Tf (the right panels) so\n\nthe distinction between the power law and the exponential function is certainly not due to considering different\ntemperatures. Figure 20 does suggest a correlation with\nCO\u00d7N 0.6 (the data plotted vs. N 0.6 without the CO\nfactor have a similar appearance indicating the irrelevance of CO in such theoretical studies) and Koga and\nTakada quote a correlation level of 84% for their data.\nIt is not very easy to distinguish between the power law\nand the exponential dependencies without a significant\nbroadening of the range in the values of N . Figure 21\nshows the data of Figure 9 redisplayed on the log - linear\nscale. The exponential trends, tf old \u223c exp(N/\u03be), cannot be ruled out and the correlation levels are 75%, 94%,\nand 95% for the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2, \u03b1, and \u03b2 structural classes respectively whereas the corresponding values for the log-log\nplots are 81%, 97%, and 94%. Even though the power\nlaw fits appear better (or, in the case of the \u03b2 proteins\nabout the same) the important point is that the exponential fits also suggest existence of the three different\nkinetic universality classes since the characteristic values\nof the \u03be parameter, as displayed in the Figure, are clearly\ndistinct. Our trends displayed in Figure 9 seem much less\nscattered than those shown in Figure 20, especially in the\nright hand panels of Figure 20. However, while we argue\nin favour of the three universality classes and then the\npower laws, we see a need for further studies and better\nunderstanding of these issues.\nIt has been found recently (Cieplak & Hoang, 2002c) that\nthe kinetics of Go models are very sensitive to the selection of what constitutes the proper set of the native contacts. For instance, if one declares a uniform cutoff range,\nRc , between the C \u03b1 atoms for making a contact, then the\ndependence of tf old on Rc is strong and non-monotonic.\nKoga and Takada declare the contact as occurring if two\nnon-hydrogen atoms in a pair of amino acids are in a distance of less than either 5.5\u00c5 or 6.5\u00c5 (and it is stated\nthat the results are stable with respect to this choice).\nOur definition of the contacts, on the other hand, involves the atomic sizes which yields a different contact\nmap and leads to different folding times.\nThe basic unsolved question is why do the folding times\nin various Go models do not depend on the contact order even though the primary ingredient of any Go model\nis the geometry of the native state of a protein. One\ntechnical problem with the contact order is that the very\nnotion of a contact is fairly subjective. Consider, for instance, the G protein \u2013 the PDB code is 1gb1 for the\nstructure determined by NMR and 1pga for the crystallographic structure. When we make use of the van der\nWaals radii then we get CO = 0.239 for 1gb1 and 0.250\nfor 1pga. The alternative procedure is to consider two\nresidues contacting if they contain non-hydrogen atoms\nwithin a distance of d. For d equal to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8\n\u00c5, our procedure yields CO of 0.194, 0.220, 0.235, 0.252,\n\n\f0.277, and 0.295 respectively (for the 1pga structure it is\n0.257 if the cutoff of 6\u00c5 is used \u2013 i.e. not very different).\nPlaxco et al. (Plaxco et al., 1998; Plaxco et al., 2000)\nused the value of d = 6\u00c5, and they quoted CO of 0.173\nfor this case. The notable difference from our value arises\nfrom the fact that in their calculation (Plaxco \u2013 private\ncommunication), all of the contacts made by the atoms\n(i.e. up to dozens for a pair of amino acids) contribute to\nthe value of CO if the corresponding distance does not exceed d. Furthermore, the 'contacts' between consecutive\nresidues (i.e. between i and i + 1) are taken into account.\nIn our calculation, the shortest local contacts are of the\ni, i + 2 type. Note that the values of CO vary with d\nquite substantially (on the scale of the figures involved)\nand the value obtained at d = 6\u00c5 is about 45% larger\nthan that quoted by Plaxco et al. The important point,\nhowever, is not that much what is the absolute value of\nCO but whether its correlation with the folding rate is\nsensitive to the choice of a specific definition of CO that is\nadopted. We have found that, quite remarkably, this correlation in the set of the experimentally studied proteins\nremains strong even when our procedure for the calculation of CO is used. We find that even though the scatter\naway from the trend is noticeably larger than when using\nthe COP \u2013 the values of CO quoted by Plaxco et al. \u2013\nthe correlations with CO remain robust and some dependence on CO develops in the case of the \u03b2-proteins. It\nis hoped that further interactions and iterations between\ntheory and experiment will make the issues of size and\ncontact order dependence more definitive. The notion of\nuniversality classes in proteins should play an important\nrole in this process.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe appreciate Kevin Plaxco's help in elucidating his papers to us and for his comments.

Experimentally determined folding times based\non tables compiled by Plaxco et al. (Plaxco et al., 2000).\nThe solid circles, open hexagons, and stars are for the\n\u03b1\u2013\u03b2-, \u03b1-, and \u03b2- proteins respectively.\nFigure 2. Experimentally determined folding times as\nsplit into three structural classes. The panels on the\nleft hand side show the dependence on N whereas\nthe panels on the right hand side show the dependence on the relative contact order parameter. Note\nthat the time window in the middle panels are shifted\nby two orders of magnitude compared to the other\npanels. The top panels corresponds to the following\n\u03b1\u2013\u03b2-proteins: 1div(56), 1gb1(56), 2ptl(63), 2ci2(65),\n1aye(71), 1ubq(76), 1hdn(85), 2u1a(88), 1aps(98), and\n2vik(126), where the number in brackets indicates the\nvalue of N (in the case of 2ci2 there are 19 more amino\nacids but their structure is undetermined). The middle\npanels correspond to the following \u03b1-proteins: 2pdd(43),\n2abd(86), 1imq(86), 1lmb(92), 1hrc(104), 256b(106), and\n1f63(154). The bottom panels correspond to the following\n\u03b2-proteins: 1efn(57), 1csp(67), 1ten(89), and 1tit(89).\nThe papers by Plaxco et al. (Plaxco et al., 1998; Plaxco\net al., 2000) also contain data on several other proteins\nthat are not shown here \u2013 we restrict ourselves only to\nthe proteins that we study through simulations. (We had\ndifficulties with the identification of the proper structure\nfiles for the remaining proteins). The subscript P in COP\nsignifies the criterion of Plaxco et al. (Plaxco et al., 1998;\nPlaxco et al., 2000) for a formation of a contact: two\nresidues are considered to be contacting if they contain\nnon-hydrogen atoms within the distance of 6\u00c5. The symbols are as described in the caption of Figure 1.\nFigure 3. The distribution of the effective contact lengths\nin T4 lysozyme as determined by the procedure which\nis based on the van der Waals radii of the atoms. The\nshaded region corresponds to the contacts that would not\nbe included if the cutoff of 7.5\u00c5 was adopted.\nFigure 4. The distribution of the chirality parameter C\nin 21 \u03b1\u2013\u03b2- proteins studied.\nFigure 5. Times to establish contacts of a given sequence\nseparation, |i \u2212 j| for crambin and for the indicated values of the damping constant \u03b3. The times are rescaled so\nthat k is equal to 1, 6, and 12 for \u03b3 equal to 2, 12 and 24\nm/\u03c4 respectively and shown top to bottom. The symbols\ncorresponding to \u03b3 = 12m/\u03c4 are reduced in size for clarity. The magnitude of the remaining symbols indicates\nthe size of the error bars. The model used here corresponds to the Lennard-Jones contacts and the contacts\nare determined based on the van der Walls radii. The\ncriterion for establishing a contact (for the first time) is\nbased on whether the two beads come within a distance\n\nof 1.5\u03c3ij of each other. This figure illustrates existence of\nsecond order effects in the dependence on \u03b3 because the\nrescaling by k brings the data points for a given event\ntogether but there is no strict overlapping.\nFigure 6. The dependence of the folding time on\ntemperature for \"synthetic\" secondary structures of 16\nmonomers. The top two panels are for the \u03b1-helix system\nH16 and the bottom panel is for the \u03b2-hairpin B16. The\ndotted lines correspond to the chirality potential (with\n\u03ba=1) included and the solid lines are for the case when\nit is not. In all cases, Rc = 7.5\u00c5. The top panel corresponds to the contact based criterion whereas the other\npanels is for the criterion based on the cutoff RMSD of\n0.2\u00c5.\nFigure 7. The dependence of the folding time on temperature for various Go models of crambin. The top panel is\nfor the contact cutoff range of 7.5\u00c5 whereas the bottom\npanel is for the locally calculated contact ranges. On\nthe top panel, the dotted line corresponds to the case\nwith the chirality potential and the solid line \u2013 without.\nOn the bottom panel, both curves include the chirality\npotential. Here, the solid (dashed) line is for the 6\u201312\n(10\u201312) contact potential. The arrows indicate values of\nthe folding temperature Tf . The heavier (lighter) arrow\nis for the 6\u201312 (10\u201312) potential.\nFigure 8. The dependence of the folding time on temperature for models of the protein 1tit. The symbols are as\nin Figure 6: the thin solid line and the triangular data\npoints are for Rc = 7.5\u00c5 and no chirality; the dotted\nline with the square data points are for Rc = 7.5\u00c5 and\nwith the chirality; the thick solid line with the solid circular data points are for the locally calculated Rc and\nthe Lennard-Jones contact potential with the chirality;\nthe dashed line with the open circular data points are for\nthe similar case with the 10\u201312 potential. The arrows indicate the values of Tf for the contacts of variable range:\nthick for the Lennard-Jones case and thin for the 10\u201312\ncase.\nFigure 9. The scaling of tf old with N for the 51 proteins as modeled by the 6\u201312 contact potential with the\nvariable contact range. The data are split into the \u03b1\u2013\u03b2-,\n\u03b1-, and \u03b2-proteins as indicated. The lines indicate the\npower law behavior with the \u03bb exponent displayed in the\nright hand corner of each panel. The error bars in the\nexponent are of order \u00b10.2. The folding times are calculated at Tmin . The correlation levels of the points shown\nare 81%, 97% and 94% for the top, middle and bottom\npanels respectively.\nFigure 10. This Figure replots the data points of Figure\n8 in one panel. For clarity, two of the most distant outlayers in each class are not shown. The solid, dotted, and\n\n\fbroken lines correspond to the slopes of 3.2, 2.5, and 1.7\nrespectively. The correlation level is 87%.\nFigure 11. Same as Figure 8 but the folding times are\ndetermined at Tf instead at Tmin . The data points represented by the arrows indicate values which are significantly off the frame of the figure (for which only the lower\nbound of 30000 \u03c4 is known). The correlation levels are\n83%, 88% and 77% for the top to bottom panels respectively.\nFigure 12. The role of the chirality potential on the folding times for the \u03b1-proteins. The hexagons are the data\npoints shown in the middle panel of Figure 8 whereas the\ncrosses correspond to the results obtained for \u03ba=0.\nFigure 13.

The\ndata symbols indicate the structural classes and are identical to those used in Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11.\nFigure 15. Same as in Figure 8 but for the 10\u201312 contact\npotential. The correlation levels are 88%, 98% and 91%\nfrom top to bottom.\nFigure 16. Same as in Figure 12 but for the 10\u201312 contact potential.\nFigure 17. Same as in Figure 8 but for the LennardJones potential with Rc = 7.5\u00c5. The correlation levels\nare 83%, 91% and 93% for the top to bottom panels respectively.\nFigure 18. Same as in Figure 9 but for the cutoff of 7.5\u00c5\nin the range of the contact potential. The solid line has\na slope of 2.5. The correlation level for all of the points\nis 88%.\nFigure 19. Same as in Figure 12 but for Rc = 7.5\u00c5.\nFigure 20. Logarithm of the folding time vs. CO\u00d7N 0.6\nfor the three structural classes. The data correspond\nto the Lennard-Jones potential with the variable range.\nThe left hand panels are for T = Tmin and the right hand\npanels for T = Tf . Note that the horizontal scale in this\nfigure is linear, not logarithmic as in most previous figures. The arrows, like in Figure 11, indicate data points\nwhich are significantly off the scale of the frame of the\nfigure.\n\nFigure 21. The data of figure 9 redisplayed on the log linear plane. The dashed lines indicate fits to the exponential law tf old \u223c exp(b/\u03be) with the values of \u03be shown\nin the right hand corner of each panel. The correlation\nlevels are 75%, 94% and 95% for the top to the bottom\npanels respectively. The overall correlation level is 82%\nwhereas for the power law fit it is 86%. The corresponding numbers for the 10\u201312 potential and the LennardJones with the cutoff of 7.5\u00c5 are 87%, 89% and 81%,\n88%. The fitted values of \u03be for the 10\u201312 potential are\nabout the same as for the Lennard-Jones case.\nAbbreviations used: PDB, Protein Data Bank; NMR,\nnuclear magnetic resonance.\n\n\fFIG. 1.\n\nFIG. 2.\n\n\fFIG. 3.\n\nFIG. 4.\n\n\fFIG. 5.\n\nFIG. 6.\n\n\fFIG. 7.\n\nFIG. 8.\n\n\fFIG. 9.\n\nFIG. 10.\n\n\fFIG. 11.\n\nFIG. 12.\n\n\fFIG. 13.\n\nFIG. 14.\n\n\fFIG. 15.\n\nFIG. 16.\n\n\fFIG. 17.\n\nFIG. 18.\n\n\fFIG. 19.\n\nFIG. 20.\n\n\fFIG. 21.\n\n\f"}
