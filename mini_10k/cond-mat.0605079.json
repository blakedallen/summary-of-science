The cooperative nature of ferroelectricity is expected to induce different polarization states\nat nanoscale due to low-dimensional boundary conditions and the strong interactions of polarization with\nstrain, charge, and other electromechanical parameters\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Many workers have reported intriguing physical phenomena occurring in ultrathin ferroelectric (FE) films and other nanostructures, such as\nintrinsic size effects [1, 2, 3], strain-enhanced FE properties [4], unusual low-dimensional phases [5], and domain\npatterns [6, 7]. On the other hand, the mechanism and\ndomain dynamics of FE switching in ultrathin films have\nrarely been investigated in spite of their scientific and\ntechnological importance [8, 9, 10].\nHistorically, the mechanism of polarization switching\ndynamics in ferroelectrics has been the subject of a great\ndeal of research. It is now believed that the polarization switching takes place not by coherent switching, but\nby the nucleation and growth of new domains [8, 9, 10].\nHowever, there still remains an unsolved issue: How do\nthe domains nucleate? In the late 1950s, Landauer emphasized that a thermodynamic nucleation process cannot play a role in FE domain switching [11]. For a nucleus\nwith reversed polarization to be created by a thermodynamic process, an energy barrier for nucleation U * should\nbe thermally overcome, as shown in Fig. 1(a). However,\nLandauer's and later estimates showed that U * is practically insurmountable by the thermal activation process:\nU * > 108 k B T at an electric field E \u223c 1 kV/cm (a typical value of the coercive field for bulk ferroelectrics) [11]\nand U \u223c 103 k B T at E \u223c 100 kV/cm (a typical value of\nthe coercive field for most FE thin films) [10, 13], where\nk B is Plank's constant and T is temperature. According\nto these estimates, it is difficult to understand the observed domain nucleation in ferroelectrics. This problem\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

Schematic diagrams of (b) the halfprolate spheroidal nucleus formation and (c) the cylindrical\nnucleus formation, with reversed polarization.\n\nhas been known as the \"Landauer's paradox\". To overcome this difficulty, numerous workers have assumed that\nthe nuclei could be formed inhomogeneously due to external effects, such as defects [12], long-range interaction\nbetween nuclei [13] and FE-electrode coupling [14]. However, in this Letter, we will demonstrate that U * could\nbe thermally overcome in the ultrathin FE film. The\nthermodynamic nucleation of reversed domains due to a\nlarge depolarization field E d can govern the polarization\nswitching process, without inclusion of any external effects, in ultrathin epitaxial BaTiO3 films.\nFully strained SrRuO3 /BaTiO3/SrRuO3 capacitors of\nhigh quality were fabricated using pulsed laser deposition\nwith reflection high-energy electron diffraction [1]. The\nthickness of BaTiO3 (dBT O ) is between 5.0 and 30 nm.\nWe were able to directly measure P -E hysteresis loops\nand polarization decay behaviors even for a 5.0 nm thick\nBaTiO3 film [1, 15, 16]. We focused on the polarization\ndecay behaviors for different BaTiO3 film thickness and\nmeasurement conditions. As shown in Fig. 2(a), these\nSrRuO3 /BaTiO3 /SrRuO3 capacitors with a 10\u00d710 \u03bcm2\narea displayed an intriguing time-dependent polarization\n\n\f2\n100\n30 nm\n15 nm\n9.0 nm\n6.5 nm\n5.0 nm\n\n10\n\n1\n2\n\n'P OPC/cm P\n\n(a)\n800 kV/cm\n640 kV/cm\n480 kV/cm\n320 kV/cm\n160 kV/cm\n0 kV/cm\n\n10\n\n1\n\nWrite\n\nRead\n\nEext\n\n(b)\nt\n\n0.1\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\nDecay time (s)\n\n(c)\n\n0.3\n\n30 nm\n20 nm\n15 nm\n6.5 nm\n5.0 nm\n\nn\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nE d _ Eext (kV/cm)\n\nFIG. 2: (color online).

The open and solid symbols correspond to the data\nwith and without E ext , respectively.\n\ndecay behavior. We measured the time-dependence of\npolarization decay using electric write/read pulses separated by a given decay time (t) [9, 15]: the right and\nthe left schematics in the inset of Fig. 2(b) show the\nelectric pulses used to measure the switching and nonswitching polarizations, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows\nthat the polarization decay follows a power-law behavior\nat room temperature [15]: namely, \u2206P (t) \u223c t \u2212n . As\nthe film becomes thinner, the value of n increases substantially. In particular, for the 5.0 nm thick capacitor,\n\u2206P decays below 1% of its initial value within 10\u22123 s.\nThis rapid polarization decay must be caused by domain\nbackswitching upon removal of the electric field and is\n\nthe subject of the discussions that follow.\nWithin the capacitor geometry, the discontinuity of\npolarization at the FE/electrode interfaces induces polarization charges. The free carriers inside the electrodes\ncompensate the resulting charge deficit. However, the finite value of the Thomas-Fermi screening length for the\nfree carriers makes the compensation incomplete, resulting in E d inside the FE layer [17]. It should be noted\nthat the generation of E d is inevitable, which will limit\nthe performance of most FE capacitor-type devices.\nTo obtain further information on the detailed effects\nof E d on the polarization decay, we measured the timedependence of \u2206P with an external static field E ext , applied in the opposite direction to that of E d during the\nelectric pulse measurements, displayed schematically by\nthe red dashed lines in the inset of Fig. 2(b) [15]. Since\nE ext will partially cancel out E d , it will slow down the\npolarization decay and consequently reduce the values of\nn. As shown in Fig. 2(b), n decreases significantly with\nan increase of E ext and should finally become zero when\nE ext becomes nearly the same as E d . This E ext value at\nn \u223c 0 provides an experimental value for E d [15]. For\nthe 5.0 nm thick BaTiO3 film, E d can be as large as 800\nkV/cm. Note that this value of E d is even larger than\nthe coercive field value, i.e. about 300 kV/cm, which was\nmeasured from direct P -E hysteresis measurements [1].\nFigure 2(c) shows the dependence of n on the total\ninternal electric field, i.e. |E d |-|E ext |, for the BaTiO3 capacitors. The abscissa-values of the solid symbols, which\nwere measured with E ext =0, correspond to the experimentally estimated Ed values. They clearly show that E d\nbecomes larger as dBT O becomes smaller. As the |E d ||E ext | increases, the values of n increases for all samples.\nHowever, we could not find any simple universal relation\nbetween n and |E d |-|E ext |.\nFurther insights could be obtained by looking into the\nmechanism of domain switching dynamics in an ultrathin\nFE film. Note that decrease of \u2206P means an increase in\nthe number of FE domains with a reversed polarization.\nIt is generally believed that the growth of the opposite\ndomains occurs in three processes, namely (a) formation\nof nuclei with opposite polarization, (b) their forward\ngrowth, and (c) sidewise growth (called, the domain wall\nmotion). For epitaxial FE films thicker than 100 nm, the\ndomain wall motion has been reported to be very important [10]. However, for ultrathin FE films, domain wall\nmotion becomes extremely slow: for example, the speed\nof the domain wall motion was estimated to be about 1\nnm/s for a 29 nm thick Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 film [8]. In addition,\nthe forward growth of the nuclei is known to occur very\nfast (i.e. a speed of 1000 m/s) [9], so the very slow domain\nwall motion could not play a major role in the polarization decay behavior observed in Fig. 2(a). Therefore,\nwe propose that, in the ultrathin FE films, the rapid polarization decay should be caused by nucleation-governed\ndomain dynamics and that the large Ed value could make\n\n\f3\nNormalized 'P\n\n1\n\n0.1\n0.01\n10\n\n-8\n\n0.1\n\nNormalized 'P\n\nwe used numerical simulations adopting the MonteCarlo algorithm, which takes into account the thermallyactivated polarization reversal process.

Each cell has a uniform P , either\npointing up or down along the c-axis.

Here, d is the\nFE film thickness, and r* and l* represent critical radius\nand length of the half-prolate spheroidal nucleus, respectively. Kay and Dunn calculated the electrostatic energy\nU for such nuclei formation [18], and showed that there\nshould exist the nucleation energy barrier U *, as shown\nin Fig. 1(a). When l* < d, the spheroidal nuclei are likely\nto be formed, and vice versa. They also showed that U *\nis proportional to \u03c3 w 3 /E 5/2 for the half-prolate nucleus\nand \u03c3 w 2 /E for the cylindrical nucleus [18], where \u03c3 w is\nthe domain wall energy. Using \u03c3 w = 10 mJ/m2 [19], the\ncrossover from the half-prolate spheroidal to cylindrical\nshapes will occur at d \u223c 10 nm [20]. Note that the very\nlarge Ed values of our ultrathin BaTiO3 films will make\nU * small enough to allow a thermally-activated nucleation process. The experimental Ed values of our BaTiO3\nfilms are between 300 and 800 kV/cm [15]. With these\nE d values, the U */k B T values are estimated to be between 4 and 20 at room temperatures, which are easily\naccessible by thermal energy.\nTo explain the observed power-law decay behavior,\n\nThe first self-energy term is quite similar to the leading P 2 term in the Landau-Devonshire equation, which\nprovides an approximation of the barrier height between\nthe bi-stable points in the FE potential [21]. The higher\norder terms P 4 and P 6 were ignored here for the simplicity of the calculations. The second term describes the\nshort-range wall interaction between the nearest neighboring domains, where rn.n. and xn.n. are the adjacent\ncircumference and unit vector of nearest neighbor domain\ncells, respectively. It has a maximum value when the 4\nnearest neighbor domain cells surrounding a nucleated\ncell have the opposite polarization. The third term originates from the long-range dipolar interaction between\ncells. The dipolar field Edi is the sum of the dipolar electric field caused by all the other cells. The last term\ndescribes the work done by external source. A similar\ncalculation method was used in micro-magnetic systems\n[22].\nWhen two electrodes sandwich a FE film, the electrode\nscreens the value of Edi produced by P s . The screening\ncan occur not only in the perpendicular direction but\nalso in the lateral direction. A numerical estimate reveals that the lateral screening length should be of the\norder of the FE film thickness. For an ultrathin FE film,\nonly the dipolar interaction between the nearest neighbor\ndomains across domain boundaries\nP couldi be important,\nxin.n. , where\nso Edi can be approximated to \u00ead n.n. rn.n.\n\u00ead is the line density of the dipolar field across the cell\nboundary.

A scaling relation between n and\nU */kB T . The open and solid symbols come from the experimental \u2206P (t) data with and without E ext , respectively.\n\nterm is identical with that of the domain wall energy.\nThe simulations were performed for room temperature\n(ef f )\ndomain dynamics with K 2 = 3\u00d7106 J/m3 , \u03c3w = -1\n2\n9\nmJ/m , and an attempt frequency of 10 Hz.\nThe Monte-Carlo simulations were performed with and\nwithout lateral screening of the interaction term between\nlong-range domains in the Hamiltonian. Without the lateral screening of the interaction term, the simulations for\nthe 5.0 nm thick BaTiO3 film predicted a very rapid exponential decay of \u2206P , as shown by the black dotted line\nin the inset of Fig. 3(a). When the screened domain interaction term was included as in Eq. (2), the simulations\nshowed that the polarization decay would slow down significantly, exhibiting a power-law behavior, as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 3(a). The calculated polarization decay\nagrees with the experimental results quite well. Without\nchanging any other parameter values, we performed the\nsame simulations for other thicknesses of BaTiO3 capacitors, and found reasonably good agreement, as shown\nin Fig. 3(a). We also performed similar simulations for\nthe cases with non-zero values of E ext , and obtained good\nagreement with experimental data, as shown in Fig. 3(b).\nThese results clearly demonstrate that domain dynamics\nmust be governed by thermally-activated nucleation processes in ultrathin films [20].\nWhen the thermodynamic domain nucleation is the\ngoverning process for polarization decay, U */k B T should\nbe the most important physical term which determines\nthe decay rate. Following the methods in Ref. [18], we\nwere able to convert the values of (|E d | - |E ext |) into\nU * values and made a plot of n vs. U */k B T . Figure 4\ndemonstrates that there might exist a universal relation\nbetween n and U */k B T , regardless of dBT O and (|E d |\n- |E ext |). To confirm the thermodynamic nucleationgoverned polarization switching process, we independently performed polarization decay measurements for\nthe 30 nm thick BaTiO3 capacitor at various tempera-\n\ntures. The solid red circles in Fig. 4 correspond to the\nexperimental data for temperature-dependent polarization decay, which fall onto the seemingly universal line\nbetween n and U */k B T . This indicates that there could\nbe a simple relation between n and U */k B T , which is universal, irrespective of film thickness, total internal electric field, and temperature.\nOur findings about the thermodynamic nucleationgoverned switching process and the empirical relation between n and U */k B T have some important implications\nfor the design of nanoscale FE devices. One implication\nconcerns the capacitor geometry of FE devices where the\npolarization decay due to the E d is predictable by the\nempirical relation we found. It could impose a new fundamental thickness limit on such FE devices. For example,\nferroelectric random access memories require the retention of a certain value of \u2206P for 10 years [9]. For our\nBaTiO3 capacitors, U * should be higher than 40 k B T\nto retain \u2206P at more than 50% of the initial value (n\n< 0.02). This value of U * corresponds to a thickness of\nabout 40 nm for our fully-strained BaTiO3 films, which is\nmuch thicker than the critical thickness (2.4 nm) for the\nferroelectricity of BaTiO3 [2]. For ultrathin film capacitors, a condition of U * \u2265 A* k B T , where A is a constant\nof the order of 10, has to be satisfied in order to have\na stable retention property. As the E d value increases\n(decrease in U *) with the reduction of dBT O , retention\nloss due to the thermodynamic nucleation of reversed domains becomes much severe. Note that this situation\nis analogous to that of the superparamagnetic limit for\nmagnetic memory devices: a long-range ferromagnetic\norder vanishes, when anisotropy energy becomes comparable to thermal fluctuation energy [23].\nOur work has clearly shown the importance of a thermodynamic domain nucleation process in the polarization decay of ultrathin FE films. The polarization decay should impose a fundamental thickness limit on\ncapacitor-type devices, which is much stricter than the\ncritical thickness limit. Further experimental and theoretical studies are clearly required to clarify the origin of the empirically-determined relation between n and\nU */k B T and its applicability to other ultrathin FE systems.\nWe thank M.
