Attention to it was first called by\nGregory & Taylor (1978) during a galactic plane survey\naimed at the identification of radio variables on both short\nand long time-scales. This precursor work unveiled what has\nremained a key property of LS I +61 303 over the years, that\nis, a clearly periodic modulation of its radio emission every\n26.5 days (Taylor & Gregory 1982).\nJust to mention the key facts, LS I +61 303 is a high\nmass X-ray binary (HMXB) with the optical component being a B0 Ve star with a circumstellar disc, V \u2243 10.7 mag, and\nwith an estimated distance of 2 kpc (Hutchings & Crampton\n1981; Paredes & Figueras 1986; Frail & Hjellming 1991).\nThe periodic modulation has also been observed at optical and infrared wavelengths (Mendelson & Mazeh 1989;\nParedes et al. 1994), in X-rays (Paredes et al. 1997), and\npossibly in \u03b3-rays as well (Massi 2004a). This modulation is\nwidely attributed to the orbital period of the binary system\nand the most accurate determination (P = 26.4960 \u00b1 0.0028\nd) comes from radio observations (Gregory 2002). A second\nmodulation, on a longer time scale of \u223c4 yr, has also been\nreported (Paredes 1987; Gregory et al. 1989) and is likely\nassociated with an outward-moving density enhancement or\nshell in the equatorial disc of the rapidly rotating Be star\n(Gregory & Neish 2002). The recent detection of relativistic radio jets \u2013 at milli-arcsecond angular scales and with\nhints of precession \u2013 by Massi et al. (2004) firmly includes\n\nLS I +61 303 in the selected class of galactic microquasars.\nThe nature of the compact object remains unknown given\nthe poor constraints in the system parameters and the lack\nof classical neutron star signatures (e.g. X-ray pulses or Type\nI bursts).\nThe seminal paper by Gregory & Taylor (1978) already\npointed out the possible connection of the peculiar radio\nstar with the COS B \u03b3-ray source CG135+01. The idea\nof LS I +61 303 as a \u03b3-ray emitter has persisted over\nthe years. Today, this star is the best counterpart candidate to 3EG J0241+6103, one of the unidentified high\nenergy (\u2265 100 MeV) sources in the 3rd EGRET catalog\n(Hartman et al. 1999). Such association is likely not to be a\nunique case. The microquasar LS 5039, probably associated\nwith another EGRET source, brought the idea that microquasars could be behind some of the unidentified EGRET\nsources (Paredes et al. 2000). Theoretical modelling of the\n\u03b3-ray emission strongly supports this interpretation. Inverse\nCompton scattering of stellar photons by the relativistic\nelectrons in the jets, can account for the overall properties of\nmicroquasars from radio to \u03b3-rays (Bosch-Ramon & Paredes\n2004).\nIn this context, it is surprising that the orbital parameters of LS I +61 303 have remained poorly known over\nthe years. Over two decades ago, Hutchings & Crampton\n(1981) carried out a series of optical spectroscopic observations from which a radial velocity curve of the binary system\nwas determined. Spectroscopic determination of the radial\nvelocity curve of LSI+61 303 is complicated by contamination of the narrow photospheric lines by emission from the\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Casares et al.\n\nBe circumstellar envelope. Here we present new optical spectroscopic observations of LS I +61 303 using modern telescopes and detectors. The idea was to obtain an improved\nset of spectroscopic orbital elements which could be used to\naddress issues such as the system's mass function, orbital\neccentricity, or the phase of periastron, among others. An\naccurate knowledge of such fundamental properties is esential to remove the lingering uncertainties that plague all\ntheoretical models for the multi-wavelength variable emission of LS I +61 303, which we believe is a prime target to\nattain a better understanding of the \u03b3-ray sky.\nIn the following sections we present our observation and\nreduction procedures, orbital fits and discussion of results.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nLS I +61 303 was observed using three different telescopes\nand instruments in the blue spectral range (\u03bb\u03bb3400-5800)\nduring years 2002 and 2003. Seventeen intermediate resolution spectra (0.63 \u00c5 pix\u22121 ) were obtained using the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) attached to the\n2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) at the Observatorio\ndel Roque de Los Muchachos on the nights of 27-31 July\n2002, 13 March 2003 and 1-7 July 2003. We used the R900V\ngrating in combination with the 235 mm camera and a 1.2\u2032\u2032\nslit to provide a spectral resolution of 83 km s\u22121 (FWHM).\nThe spectral type standard \u03c4 Sco was also observed with the\nsame instrumentation for the purpose of radial velocity analysis. In addition, this star has a very low projected rotational\nvelocity, lower than 5 km s\u22121 according to Hardorp & Scholz\n(1970) and Stickland & Lloyd (1995). Six high-resolution\nspectra of LS I +61 303 were also obtained with the 2.7\nm Harlan J. Smith telescope and the 2dcoude spectrograph\n(Tull et al. 1995) at McDonald Observatory (Texas) on UT\n3-5 August 2002 and 8-9 April 2003. We used the F3 focal\nstation, the E2 echelle grating, and a 1.\u2032\u2032 2 slit to achieve a\nFWHM resolution of about 5 km s\u22121 . Finally, five low resolution spectra (2.74 \u00c5 pix\u22121 ) were obtained on the nights\nof 13 October and 15-17 December 2003 with the ALFOSC\nspectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at the\nObservatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos. We employed\ngrism 6 and a 0.5\u2032\u2032 slit which resulted in a spectral resolution of 235 km s\u22121 , as measured from gaussian fits to the\narc lines. A complete log of the observations is presented in\nTable 1.\nThe images were bias corrected and flat-fielded, and\nthe spectra subsequently extracted using conventional optimal extraction techniques in order to optimize the signalto-noise ratio of the output (Horne 1986). Frequent observations of comparison arc lamp or hollow cathode lamp images\nwere performed in the course of each run and the pixel-towavelength scale was derived through polynomial fits to a\nlarge number of identified reference lines. The final rms scatter of the fit was always <1/30 of the spectral dispersion.\n\n3\n\nRADIAL VELOCITIES AND ORBITAL\nSOLUTION\n\nAll the spectra were prepared for the cross-correlation analysis by subtracting a low order spline fit to the continuum\n\nTable 1.

The template spectrum, \u03c4 Sco, was broadened\nby 113 km s\u22121 and 226 km s\u22121 in order to match the width\nof the photospheric lines in the LS I +61 303 spectra obtained with the INT and NOT, respectively. These broadening factors were derived by subtracting several broadened\nversions of \u03c4 Sco from individual spectra of LS I +61 303\nand performing a \u03c72 test on the residuals (see details in\nMarsh, Robinson & Wood 1994). To broaden the template\nspectrum we employed a Gray rotational profile (Gray 1992)\nwith a limb darkening coefficient of \u01eb = 0.33, appropriate for\nour spectral type and wavelength range. Note that the optimal broadening is driven by differences in instrumental resolution for the case of the NOT spectra, but not the INT since\nthe same setup was used in both the LS I +61 303 spectra\nand the template. In the latter case, the broadening is directly associated to v sin i and confirms that the optical star\nin LS I +61 303 is rapidly rotating. On the other hand, since\nthe instrumental resolution of the McDonald data is much\nhigher than the template, we decided to optimally broaden\nthe target spectra (to match the template) for the sake of\nthe cross-correlation analysis. The optimal broadening was\nfound to be 113 km s\u22121 .\nWe cross-correlated every individual spectrum of\nLS I +61 303 with the conveniently broadened template of\n\u03c4 Sco after masking out the interstellar absorption features\nat \u03bb3934 (Ca ii K) and \u03bb4430. The correlations include H i\nlines from H\u03b2 to H8 and all He i and He ii lines in the spectral range \u03bb\u03bb3850\u20135020 (see Fig. 3). Furthermore, since the\nH i lines are prone to contamination by stellar wind emission in early-type stars, we also decided to obtain a set of\nradial velocities with only He i and He ii lines. The resulting velocities were folded on the radio ephemeris of Gregory\n(2002) (P = 26.4960 d, T0 =HJD2443366.775). Table 2 lists\nthe radial velocities measured using the two different sets of\nspectral lines. Individual velocities were extracted following\nthe method of Tonry & Davis (1979), where parabolic fits\nwhere performed to the peak of the cross-correlation functions, and the uncertainties are purely statistical.\n\n\fOrbital Parameters of the Microquasar LS I +61 303\nTable 2.

This was accomplished using the sophisticated binary fitting program originally developed by\nWilson & Devinney (1971; hereafter W-D)1 . Briefly, the WD program assumes a Roche model to describe the shape of\nthe components and includes a complete treatment of the\nradiative properties of the system (limb darkening, temperature variations accross the surface, etc.). Thus, the model\nadequately takes into account the non-keplerian contributions to the measured radial velocities. Fitting is carried out\nthrough differential corrections and, in the case of radial\nvelocity solutions, convergence is achieved very rapidly. In\nthe solutions we adjusted the following orbital parameters:\nvelocity semiamplitude (K1 ), systemic velocity (\u03b3), eccentricity (e), argument of the periastron (\u03c9), and phase of the\nperiastron (\u03c6peri ). A set of fixed parameters necessary to the\nfitting procedure were tuned to match the expected radiative\nproperties of the B0 V optical companion (i.e., Teff \u224828 000\nK, log g\u22484; Cox 2000), although the effect of the adopted\nparameters on the solutions is very weak. Table 3 presents\nthe final best-fitting parameters for the two sets of radial\nvelocities.\nThe two solutions yield orbital parameters that are consistent within 1\u03c3 except for the systemic velocity, which is\nmore negative when the Balmer lines are included in the\ncorrelation. This suggests that the Balmer lines may be contaminated by some blueshifted absorption, consistent with\nthe suspicion that the Be primary might have a significant\nwind. Therefore, we prefer to adopt the solution that con1\n\nH i+He i+He ii\n\nHe i+He ii (adopted)\n\n0.63\u00b10.11\n7.8\u00b113.9\n\u221248.4\u00b11.8\n0.22\u00b10.02\n18.1\u00b13.3\n7.4\u00b11.6\n0.0076+0.0060\n\u22120.0038\n7.8\n\n0.72\u00b10.15\n21.0\u00b112.7\n\u221240.2\u00b11.9\n0.23\u00b10.02\n22.6\u00b16.3\n8.2\u00b12.9\n0.0107+0.0163\n\u22120.0077\n8.5\n\nObs.\n\nThe original code has suffered major upgrades since its first\nrelease, including significant improvements in the underlying\nphysical models.

Figure 1\nshows these velocities, together with the best-fitting orbital\nsolution. To better illustrate the resulting orbit, we show\nin Fig. 2 the relative motion of the compact object around\nthe optical companion as seen from above (i.e., no inclination value assumed). Some relevant phases (i.e., periastron,\napastron, and conjunctions) are labelled.\nWe can now use our orbital solution to Doppler-shift all\nthe individual spectra and produce an average spectrum in\nthe reference frame of the primary (see Fig. 3). This can be\ncompared to the spectrum of the B0 V template \u03c4 Sco and\nwe find that LS I +61 303 is best fitted when the template is\nscaled by a factor 0.65. In other words, the results indicate\nthat the primary contributes 65 percent of the total light.\nThe rest can possibly be attributed to emission from the\ndisc around the Be star. The residual of the spectral subtraction indeed shows broad double-peaked Balmer emission\nfeatures (i.e., characteristic of a disc geometry) with possible narrow reversal absorptions superimposed, in accordance\nwith observations of Be-shell stars (e.g., Porter & Rivinius\n2003; Slettebak 1988). However, inspection of high resolution H\u03b1 profiles published in literature (e.g. Paredes et al.\n1994) show clear double-peaked profiles with shallow central\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

Therefore, contamination of the residual Balmer profiles by shell lines can almost\nbe ruled out and we interpreted the observed profiles as being shaped by kinematic (doppler) broadening.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur radial velocity data and orbital solution yields a number of orbital parameters but does not provide a full charac-\n\nterization of the system's physical properties. For example,\nonly the mass function and not the mass ratio can be determined because only the velocities of the optical component\nare measurable. In addition, the orbital inclination remains\nunknown as usual in any radial velocity curve solution. Thus,\nwith the available data we can only plot Fig. 4 that relates\nthe mass of the compact object (MX ) and the optical companion (Mopt ) for several values of the orbital inclination.\nNote that the plot has been computed with our adopted radial velocity solution that yields f (M )=0.0107+0.0163\n\u22120.0077 M\u2299 .\nTo further constrain the system's properties we must employ\nadditional external information.\nThe expected masses of the components can be used\nto constrain the system's geometry. For example, the mass\nof the optical component of the system can be inferred\nfrom its atmospheric properties. Discussions on the most\nlikely mass values for the primary star can be found\nin Hutchings & Crampton (1981), Mart\u0131\u0301 & Paredes (1995),\nPunsly (1999), and Massi et al. (2004), overall favouring a\nmass interval of Mopt =10\u201315 M\u2299 (shaded area in Fig. 4).\nWith this constraint, the compact object would be a neu< \u25e6\ntron star for inclinations 25\u25e6 <\n\u223c i \u223c 60 and a black hole if\n\u25e6\n<\ni \u223c 25 .\nThere are several options to obtain independent information on the inclination. For example, we have measured\nv sin i \u2243 113 km s\u22121 , which is about 3 times smaller than\nthe value reported by Hutchings & Crampton (1981). We\n\n\fOrbital Parameters of the Microquasar LS I +61 303\nnote that our instrumental resolution is higher than that of\nHutchings & Crampton (83 km s\u22121 versus \u223c130 km s\u22121 ),\nwhich would favour our determination. This is relevant for\nthe orbital inclination (assuming that the Be star's spin axis\nand the orbital axis are aligned) because current observational constraints indicate that Be stars rotate at \u22430.7\u20130.8\ntimes2 the critical rotational velocity(Porter 1996). In the\ncase of the optical component of LS I +61 303 this would be\nvcrit \u223c500\u2013550 km s\u22121 . Therefore, if the primary is a normal\nBe star, we are viewing the binary at a low inclination angle\nof \u223c15\u201320\u25e6 but we cannot rule out that the Be star may\nbe rotating at substantially lower speed than vcrit . However,\nthe lack of clear shell lines in our spectra, such as FeII \u03bb4584,\npoints to a rough upper limit i . 60\u25e6 . A lower limit to the\ninclination of i \u223c10\u201315\u25e6 is obtained from the restriction that\nthe rotational velocity of the optical companion should not\nexceed 0.9 times the critical value. Perhaps future accurate\nmodelling of the spectral line profiles could provide a better\nconstraint on the viewing angle of the Be star and thus on\nthe orbital inclination.\nAdditional information on the inclination might come\nfrom the geometry of the relativistic jet as derived from\nthe VLBI images of Massi et al. (2004) by assuming perpendicularity between the ejection direction and the orbital\nplane. However, because of the possible precession reported\nby these authors, values in the full range i =0\u201390\u25e6 could be\nfeasible.\nTo conclude with the discussion of the orbital inclination, it seems that a crude value of \u223c30\u25e6 (with an uncertainty of some 20\u25e6 ) is the best compromise given the available constraints at this point. It is clear that further observations will be required to better define this important\nparameter of the system. With the current knowledge, both\na neutron star and black hole are equally plausible as the\ncompact object in the LS I +61 303 system.\nBut there is one very relevant parameter that is indeed well-constrained by our orbital solution, and that is\nthe phase of the periastron passage. We obtain a value of\n\u03c6peri = 0.23 \u00b1 0.02, in good agreement with that obtained\nby Hutchings & Crampton (1981) (\u03c6peri = 0.2), when the\nphase origin is set by the radio ephemeris of Gregory (2002).\nA key question is how this periastron passage phase relates\nto the emission variability of LS I +61 303. There have been\na number of studies of the occurrences of radio outbusts\nin LS I +61 303 and there is general consensus in that the\nradio emission peaks are distributed over a wide phase interval of about 0.45\u20130.95 (e.g., Paredes, Estalella & Rius 1990;\nGregory & Neish 2002). In contrast, X-ray maxima seem to\noccur at somewhat earlier phases of 0.43\u20130.47, although this\nis based on only two observations. From three well-studied\nradio outbursts, Gregory (2002) was able to determine the\nphases at which the onset of the outbursts occurred and obtained values in the interval 0.33\u20130.40. With our new determination of the periastron phase, it is now clear that a delay\nexists beween the closest approach of the system's components and the radio and X-ray outbursts. The onset of the\noutbursts appears to take place about 2.5\u20134 days after peri-\n\n2\n\nWith a likelihood that this might be underestimated due to\nequatorial gravity darkening effects (see Townsend, Owocki &\nHowarth 2004, Porter & Rivinius 2003).\n\n5\n\nastron passage. The delay is likely due to inverse Compton\nenergy losses of relativistic electrons in the radio jets in the\nperiastron vicinity (see Massi 2004b for details). This now\nwell-established result has strong implications on the models\ndevised to explain the emission behaviour of LS I +61 303.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments to\nthe manuscript.
