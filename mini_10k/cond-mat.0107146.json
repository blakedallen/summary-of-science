THE MODEL\n\nIn this paper, we shall consider the six-vertex model on\na square lattice. Originally, this model was introduced\nas a model describing the ferroelectric properties of the\nhydrogen-bonded planar crystals [1]. The hydrogen atom\npositions are specified by attaching arrows to the lattice\nedges. In the six-vertex case, the arrows are arranged\nin such a way that there are always two arrows pointing away from, and two arrows pointing into, each lattice\nvertex (the so-called \"ice rule\"); thus, there are six possible states at each vertex (see, Fig. 1). The statistical\nweights, a, b and c, of the allowed states are invariant\nunder the simultaneous reversal of all arrows:\na\n\nb\n\u2744\n\u2732 \u2732\n\u2744\n\n\u2732 \u273b\u271b\n\u2744\n\n\u2732 \u273b\n\u2732\n\n\u271b \u273b\u271b\n\n\u2744\n\u271b \u2732\n\n\u273b\n\n\u273b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\nThis model was introduced in Ref. [5] in connection with\nthe calculation of the correlation functions for exactly\nsolvable 1+1 dimensional models [6]. It appears that\nsome problems from the theory of alternating sign matrices [7,8] and domino tilings [9] may be reformulated in\nterms of this model.\nAperiodic boundary conditions are of interest since\nthey demonstrate the influence of the boundaries and internal defects of real physical systems on their bulk properties. By renormalization group method, it was shown\nthat the behavior of the correlation functions near the\nsurfaces and defects is quite different from the bulk behavior [10]. The exactly solvable six-vertex model with\nthe DWBC provides us the opportunity to study the surface phenomena beyond renormalization group scheme.\n\n\u273b\n\nThe partition function of the model on an N \u00d7 N square\nlattice is obtained by summing over all possible arrow\nconfigurations {C},\nX\n\n\u271b\n\nFIG. 2.

THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE\nBOUNDARY POLARIZATION\n\n{C}\n\nwhere n1 , n2 , and n3 are the number of vertices of type a,\nb, and c in configuration C, respectively (n1 + n2 + n3 =\nN 2 ).\nThe six-vertex model was studied for both periodic\n(PBC) [2,3] and fixed boundary conditions [4]. In this\npaper, we are concerned exclusively with the domain wall\nboundary conditions (DWBC), namely, all arrows on the\ntop and bottom of the lattice are pointing inward while\n\nThe partition function ZN of the model with the\nDWBC may be represented as the determinant of an\nN \u00d7 N matrix [11,12]. Though there exist several combinatorial representations for this determinant [13,14], it\nhas so far only been calculated explicitly for some special\ncases [7]. Significant progress has recently been achieved\n\n1\n\n\fThe boundary polarization on the arbitrary edge is expressed in terms of linear combination of partition functions on sublattices.\n\nin studying the asymptotics of ZN as N \u2192 \u221e. Under some special restrictions on the values of the vertex\nweights, the bulk free energy was calculated in Ref. [15]\nby using the Toda equation [16]. A more general result was obtained in Ref. [17] by a reformulation of the\nsix-vertex model as a Hermitian matrix model to which\nsaddle point integration method was applied. A representation convenient for the large N analysis was suggested\nalso in Ref. [18].\nLess is known about the correlation functions of this\nmodel for at least two reasons. First, the calculation of\nthe correlators, in general, is a more complicated problem\nthan the calculation of the corresponding partition function. Second, the lack of translation invariance caused\nby the special boundary conditions introduces additional\ndifficulties. Some correlation functions for the inhomogeneous model (the model with the statistical weights depending on the position of the vertex) with special choice\nof the weights were considered in Ref. [19].\nThe boundary polarization is the one-point correlation\nfunction that describes the probability for the arrow on\nthe fixed lattice edge on the boundary to be pointing in\neither direction. The symmetry of the model allows us to\nconsider only vertical arrows. Let us denote by \u03c7N the\nprobability for the vertical arrow to be pointing down.\nNote that \u03c7N for PBC is independent of the position\nof the edge and is just a spontaneous polarization of the\nsystem [3]. Here, we shall discuss \u03c7N for the edge located\nat the lower-right corner of the lattice (in Fig. 3 this edge\nis dotted):\n\u271b\n\n\u2744 \u2744 \u2744 \u2744 \u2744\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\n\u271b\n\n\u2732\n\nIII. THE CONNECTION WITH ORTHOGONAL\nPOLYNOMIALS\n\nDue to the multiplicativity of the partition function,\none can set c = 1 without loss of generality. Hence, the\nmodel is characterized by only two parameters, a and\nb. In Fig. 4 the phase diagram on the (a, b) plane for\nthe model with PBC is plotted (cf., Fig. 8.5 of Ref. [3]).\nIt may be regarded as the phase diagram for the model\nwith the DWBC, in the sense that the free energy takes a\ndifferent analytic form in the regions divided by the solid\nand dashed lines (see Ref. [17] for details). Naturally,\nthe ground state and low temperature behavior do not\ncoincide with those for the model with PBC.\nb\n\n1\n\n\u2732\n\n1\n\na\n\nFIG. 4. The phase diagram in terms of the weights a and\n\nIn this and next section, we shall consider the model\non the solid line in Fig. 4. It is convenient to use the\nfollowing parametrization of the vertex weights on this\nline:\n\u001a\na = 1/2 \u2212 x\n,\n\u22121/2 < x < 1/2.\nb = 1/2 + x\n\nFIG. 3. \u03c7N is calculated for the arrow on the dotted edge.\n\nIt turns out that if the arrow on the dotted edge is pointing down, then due to the imposed boundary conditions,\nthe allowed vertex configuration at the bottom and the\nright boundaries is determined in a unique way. Actually, in the lower-right corner one has the vertex of type\nc; thus, the rest of the 2N \u2212 2 vertices are of type b,\nand the DWBC are valid for the residual N \u2212 1 \u00d7 N \u2212 1\nsublattice.

RESULTS AT OTHER POINTS\n\n(7)\n\nAt present there are several points on the phase diagram, where the determinant has been calculated in\nclosed form.\n(i) The \"free-fermion case\", a2 + b2 = 1 (dotted circular quadrant on the phase diagram). On this circle, one\nhas a very simple result ZN = 1. This result can be obtained by an appropriate limit from the inhomogeneous\npartition function [6,12]. Therefore, one has\n\nNow let us discuss briefly the general case when a and\nb are arbitrary positive constants. The partition function is given by formulas (2) and (3), while \u03c6(x) should\nbe changed (see, for example, [6,11,12]), the weight \u03c1(\u03be)\nis obtained by straightforward calculations [17], and the\ncorresponding expression for \u03c7N +1 differs from Eq. (7)\nby a constant.\n\nln \u03c7N = 2(N \u2212 1) ln b .\n\n(11)\n\n(ii) The \"ice point\", a = b = 1. All weights are equal,\nand the partition function is just the number of allowed\nconfigurations {C} (Sec. I). In this case one has Ref. [7]\n\nIV. THE LARGE N LIMIT\n\nEquation (7) reduces the problem of calculation of the\nprobability \u03c7N +1 to the calculation of the normalizing coefficient hN . At present there exists a powerful method\nfor studying the N \u2192 \u221e behavior of hN . This method is\nbased on the matrix Riemann-Hilbert conjugation problem [21].

The first omitted\n\u22122\nterm in Eq. (13) is of the order N , and depends on the\nparity of N .\nWe complete this paper with the following statement.\nOne can see that in expansion (9), which was obtained\nfor a + b = 1, there exists a logarithmic term. For arbitrary a and b, we state that the logarithmic terms in the\nlarge N expansion of ln \u03c7N will take place only under the\nfollowing conditions: weights a and b are either on the\nsolid line a + b = 1, or on the dashed lines |a \u2212 b| = 1\nof the phase diagram (Fig. 4). For the model with PBC,\nthe logarithmic terms could be explained via conformal\nfield theory [6]. Similar arguments are valid for the discussed model. The influence of the boundary condition\nchanging operators [24] should also now be taken into\nconsideration. If we move away from the solid or dashed\nlines, the logarithmic terms vanish and the expansion of\nln \u03c7N will be in integer powers of N . Expansions (11),\n(12) and (13) indeed contain only integer powers of N ,\nthus confirming the above statement.\nFinally, we would like to mention that the six-vertex\nmodel with any boundary conditions can be considered\nas a model for a description of interface roughening of a\ncrystal surface [25]. An important point in these studies is the existence of exact analytical results, which are\nknown for the six-vertex model with PBC [1\u20133] . We\nbelieve that our analytical results for the model with\nDWBC provide one more basis for the experiments and\nsimulations in this direction.\nWe thank A. H. Vartanian for bringing Ref.
