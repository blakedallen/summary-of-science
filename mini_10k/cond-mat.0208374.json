The devices follow\nthe Kane proposal to use the nuclear spins of 31 P donors in 28 Si as qubits, controlled by metal\nsurface gates and measured using single electron transistors (SETs). The accurate registration of\n31\nP donors to control gates and read-out SETs is achieved through the use of a self-aligned process\nwhich incorporates electron beam patterning, ion implantation and triple-angle shadow-mask metal\nevaporation.\nPACS numbers: 61.72.Vv, 81.16.Nd, 85.35.-p, 85.40.Ry\n\nLarge-scale quantum computers [1] promise a massive increase in the speed of important computational\ntasks such as prime factorisation [2] and database searching [3]. One of the most promising schemes, which\nis capable of being scaled up to processors with many\nquantum bits (qubits), is the silicon-based solid-state\nquantum computer (SSQC), first proposed by Kane [4].\nSuch devices require the positioning of single dopant\natoms to better than 10 nm: a highly challenging\ntask. However the paradigm has a major advantage over\ncompeting proposals in that the fabrication strategy is\ncompatible with industry-standard silicon metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) processing technology.\nA silicon-based SSQC is depicted schematically in Figure 1. The nuclear spin (I) of single 31 P donor atoms\n(I=1/2) embedded in 28 Si (I=0) constitutes the qubit.\n'A'-gates above the donors enable single-qubit operations\nby controlling the hyperfine interaction between electron\nand nucleus. 'J'-gates between donors enable two-qubit\noperations by controlling the exchange interaction between adjacent donors [4]. During the qubit read-out\nprocess, nuclear spin information is transferred to electron spin states as described by Kane [4]. Under the\ninfluence of an asymmetric gate bias, the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple dictates that electron motion between two P\n\nFIG. 1: Figure 1. SSQC architecture in which 31 P atoms form\nan array of quantum bits in 28 Si. The SET is used to read\nout the spin configuration of the two left-most donors.\n\ndonors (to form a two-electron bound state - see Fig. 1)\nwill only take place if the electrons are in a spin-singlet\nstate. Qubit read-out is achieved using a charge-sensitive\nsingle electron transistor (SET) to detect whether or not\nthis charge transfer occurs, thereby allowing determination of the two-electron spin state [4]. The device must\nbe operated at temperatures of 1 K, or below, in order to\nminimise qubit decoherence and to ensure that all electron spins are in their ground state.\nRealization of the structure shown in Fig. 1 requires\nnot only the ability to form ordered arrays of 31 P atoms\nin 28 Si, but also a capability to accurately align these\natoms to their control gates and read-out SETs. These\nrequirements remain relevant to variations on the original\nKane design, including those utilizing either nuclear-spin\nqubits [5] or electron-spin qubits [6]. Recently, it has\nbeen demonstrated [7] that P qubit arrays on Si can be\nfabricated using an atom-structuring approach in which\na scanned probe is used to pattern a monohydride resist\non a silicon surface. While this approach can be extended\nto produce high-precision P donor arrays on a large scale,\na number of challenging steps, including subsequent epitaxial overgrowth and gate registration, have yet to be\ndemonstrated.\nThis paper describes an approach to SSQC fabrication\nwhich has two key advantages over other schemes: (i)\nall of its steps are based upon existing semiconductor\nprocesses; and (ii) it employs a self-alignment technique\nfor registering single donors to control gates and readout SETs. The scheme described here is designed for\nfew-qubit devices which will be critical for determining\nthe feasibility of a SSQC. It is also possible to envisage\nmodifications which would allow scale-up of the process\nfor many-qubit array fabrication. Here we demonstrate\nthe fabrication of an integrated array of control gates and\nSETs, and present a detailed strategy for self-aligning\nthese structures to individual P atoms.\nFor the purposes of this paper, we consider a sixdonor, four-qubit device as shown in Figure 2(a). We\nfirst outline the conceptual approach for the process,\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Figure 2. (a) Schematic of a six-donor device. The\ndots represent individual P atoms. (b) The two EBL patterns required to form the structure shown in (a). The black\npattern forms the gates and SETs after triple-angle shadow\nevaporation, while the overlap of the grey and black patterns\ndefines the qubit locations.\n\nthen focus on a particular implementation employing poly-methylmethacrylate (PMMA), poly-methacrylic\nacid (PMAA) and polymethylglutarimide (PMGI) resists.\nSurface metallisations for the device are defined using multi-angle shadow evaporation, which is already a\nwell-established technique for fabricating Al/Al2 O3 SETs\n[8]. A single high-resolution electron beam lithography\n(EBL) step is used to create the black pattern (Pattern\nA) shown in Fig. 2(b). Following resist development,\ntriple-angle shadow evaporation [9] and oxidation are\nperformed to produce Al and Al/Al2 O3 structures which\nconstitute all of the gates and SETs shown in Fig. 2(a).\nAlthough some extraneous features are produced by the\nshadow evaporation process, these will not significantly\naffect the performance of the device. The resist structure\nused for the shadow evaporation step (Resist A) must be\nable to produce a wide cavity beneath fine features in a\nsurface layer [9] and would generally be comprised of two\nor more resist layers of differing sensitivity, as discussed\nlater.\nA linear array of self-aligned donors can be realized by\nincorporating an additional EBL step using a different\nresist (Resist B). The locations of the six donors in the\ndevice may be defined using the grey pattern (Pattern\nB) shown in Fig 2(b). The points at which Patterns A\nand B cross define the donor sites. Access channels for\nion implantation, which extend to the substrate at these\ndonor sites, may be opened by either wet development or\ndry etching. A critical requirement is that the two resist\nstructures utilize different developer solutions or different\ndry etch processes.\nPartial etching or development of Resist A, along with\ncomplete etching or development of Resist B produces\na profile such as that shown in Figure 3(a) for ion implantation. Ions must be implanted at low energy (of\n\norder keV) to ensure donors are located 5-20 nm below\nthe Si/SiO2 interface and with an areal dose such that on\naverage one ion is implanted at each donor site. By Poissonian statistics, the probability that a single ion lands\nin each of N sites is given [6] by 0.367N . As N increases,\nthe device yield would fall to low levels without additional strategies aimed at controlling ion placement. One\nsuch strategy involves the use of on-chip ion impact detectors which electrically register the arrival of each ion\nin the device, during the implant process [10]. This approach ensures that exactly N donors will be implanted\nin an intended N-donor device. Recent results using this\ntechnique demonstrate the detection of single 31 P+ ions\nof energy 15 keV entering an i-Si substrate [10]. This\nion energy leads to an average implant depth of 20 nm,\nsuitable for a SSQC device. In order to scale-up this\nprocess for the construction of many-qubit processors it\nwill be necessary to localise the ion beam to a spot size\nsmaller than the spacing between donor sites and move\nthe beam between each site until a single ion implant\nevent is registered. Such localisation could be achieved\nusing a focused ion beam (FIB) or a moveable mask with\na nanomachined aperture [11].\nAlthough ion implantation is a convenient technique\nfor introducing donors into Si, there are two aspects of\nthe process which could impair the reliable operation of\na SSQC, namely straggle of P donors from their desired\nlocations and damage to the Si lattice. The effect of\nstraggle has been estimated using SRIM software (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) and for typical donor\ndepths of 10 nm we find a lateral straggle of order 5 nm\n[12]. These values suggest that it will be necessary to individually tune the gate voltages that control each donor\nqubit, to take into account its specific location. Lateral\nstraggle can be improved somewhat by channelling the\nimplant along a crystal axis, however, the amorphous\nSiO2 barrier layer will serve to randomise the incident\nangle and reduce channelling.\nThere is limited information on damage induced by\n\nFIG. 3: Figure 3.

Profiles in (a) and (b) are cross-sections along XY in Fig. 2(b).\n(c) SEM image of ion implantation channel in bilayer resist of\nPMMA (upper) and PMMA/PMAA (lower). (d) SEM image\nof multi-angle evaporation cavity in bilayer resist.\n\n\f3\nsingle implanted donors in Si, although molecular dynamics calculations [13] indicate that considerable damage may be automatically removed by self-annealing in\nthe first picosecond after impact. Residual damage can\nbe removed by annealing after the metallisation of the\ngates and removal of the resist layers. In the worst case,\nit may be necessary to anneal at temperatures as high\nas 900C in order to remove impact damage and activate\nthe P donor electrons. Given that SET tunnel barriers\nare likely to be degraded above 400C during long anneal steps, it may be necessary to use a rapid thermal\nanneal (RTA) process for these devices. Alternatively,\nSETs could be fabricated in a separate EBL step after annealing [10]. Although the alignment of SETs to donors\nwould be compromised in this case, read-out is still expected to be successful due to the demonstrated high\nsensitivity of SETs. An advantage of post-fabrication\nof the SETs is that refractory metals could be used for\nthe gates. Some refractory metals, such as tungsten,\nhave high melting points and also exhibit low diffusivity through SiO2 barrier layers.\nFollowing ion implantation, complete development of\nResist A produces a cavity suitable for multi-angle\nshadow evaporation (see Fig. 3b). Any remaining Resist B on the floor of the cavity is also removed at this\npoint. The triple-angle shadow evaporation process depicted in Fig. 3(b) produces self-aligned gate and SET\nstructures with A-gates located directly above implanted\ndonors, thus realizing the complete device shown in Fig.\n2(a).\nWe now describe a particular example of the fabrication strategy outlined above which employs only wet\nchemical processing. Firstly, PMGI (Resist B) is prepared on a Si/SiO2 substrate. Pattern B is exposed using\nEBL and developed with an aqueous developer. Next, a\nbilayer (Resist A) of PMMA and PMMA/PMAA copolymer is prepared on top of the PMGI and Pattern A is exposed. Partial development of the bilayer with an organic\nsolvent (MIBK/IPA) is then carried out to create narrow trenches down to the PMGI. This developer solution\ndoes not affect the PMGI. Fig. 3(c) shows the profile of\na partially developed bilayer cavity. Where the two EBL\npatterns overlap, channels extending to the substrate surface are created, through which ion implantation may be\nperformed.\nAs a trial of this process, we have exposed and developed a series of lines in bilayer resist, on top of and\nperpendicular to a series of lines exposed and developed\nin PMGI (Fig. 4a). The resulting structure was etched\nusing an HF solution and then the resist layers removed.\nAtomic force microscope (AFM) imaging (Figs. 4b and\n4c) confirmed that etch pits in the Si/SiO2 substrate were\nformed only where the two sets of lines overlapped.\nFollowing ion implantation, the bilayer is fully developed and any PMGI remaining in the cavity is removed\nwith a solvent which does not affect the bilayer. Fig. 3(d)\nshows the profile of a typical bilayer cavity. Triple-angle\nAl shadow evaporation is then performed with in-situ ox-\n\nFIG. 4: Figure 4.

Removal of any remaining resist then leaves\nthe structure shown in Fig. 2(a) on the substrate surface.\nThe triple-angle evaporation process described above\nhas been demonstrated using Pattern A on a bilayer resist, producing the device shown in Figure 5(a). Fig.\n5(b) shows a side-view schematic of the same device indicating the various metal layers deposited during the\nthree evaporation steps. The intended donor sites are indicated although ion implantation was not carried out on\nthis trial device. The 50 nm-wide lines in Fig. 5(a) are\nthe A-gates, which lie directly above the intended donor\nsites. The J-gates on this device are slightly wider than\nthe A-gates due to imperfect overlaying of metal lines.\nThe gate spacing of this device is sufficiently small to\nfabricate an electron-spin SSQC [6], however, it will be\nnecessary to reduce metal linewidths to 5-10 nm to realize\na nuclear-spin-based device [4, 5]. Such linewidths have\nbeen realized using single layer EBL resists [14] and work\nis underway to achieve this using our multilayer process.\nWe are currently integrating ion implantation into the\nprocess to produce a fully configured few-qubit SSQC device. In the first instance, a two-donor device (Fig. 6a)\n\nFIG. 5: Figure 5. (a) SEM image of gate and SET array for a\nsix-donor SSQC device produced by triple-angle evaporation.\n(b) Cross section of the device in (a) through the line marked\nXY.\n\n\f4\nwill be implanted. Fig. 6(b) shows the EBL patterns\nrequired to produce such a device. Fig. 6(c) is an SEM\nimage of a demonstration metallisation of the gate and\nSET array formed by triple-angle shadow evaporation using Pattern A. The same device is shown on a larger scale\nin Fig. 6(d) revealing connections leading out to macroscopic bond pads.\nFigure 7(a) shows a detailed SEM image of a typical SET fabricated by double-angle shadow evaporation\non a bilayer resist. Fig. 7(b) shows the clear Coulomb\nblockade oscillations measured in such devices. The high\ntransconductance (dG/dVg ) demonstrates the sensitivity\nof these devices to single charge transfer events, and thus\ntheir suitability for use as qubit read-out devices in the\nKane scheme. Recently, we have used two such devices in\na twin-SET configuration to measure controlled electron\ntransfer between two metallic dots, joined by a tunnel\nbarrier [15].\nAlthough here we have focused on a particular process implementation using PMGI, PMMA and\nPMMA/PMAA, there are a number of possible variations. To obtain the highest possible aspect ratios for the\nion implantation channels, dry etching could be used in\nplace of the wet development procedures discussed above.\nFor example, instead of a standard bilayer structure, Resist A could be composed of a Ge layer sandwiched be-\n\nFIG. 7: Figure 7. (a) SEM image of an Al/Al2 O3 SET. (b)\nCoulomb blockade oscillations measured on a typical SET at\n30 mK.\n\ntween two organic resists [16]. Pattern A could be exposed in the top resist layer and developed, then reactive\nion etching with CF4 gas used to remove the exposed\nGe [16]. Next, another gas could be used to anisotropically etch the underlying organic resist, thereby defining vertical-walled ion implantation channels. In another\nvariation, the order of Resists A and B could be reversed.\nAfter ion implantation, Resist B would be removed, allowing for complete development of Resist A, followed by\ntriple-angle shadow evaporation.\nIn conclusion, we have designed a process involving two\nEBL exposures, ion implantation and triple-angle shadow\nevaporation capable of producing self-aligned gate, SET\nand donor structures for a few-qubit SSQC. The process can utilize a variety of different resists, development\nand etch procedures. We have made preliminary test\nstructures comprising gates and read-out SETs and have\ndemonstrated that cavities for ion implantation may be\nformed in an organic trilayer resist structure. Work on\nincorporating ion implantation into our process is currently underway.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nFIG. 6: Figure 6. (a) Schematic of a two-donor device.
