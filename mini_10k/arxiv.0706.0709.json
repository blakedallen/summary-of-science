To this purpose we determine\nthe real-time evolution of a single particle excitation and the single-particle spectral function using density-matrix renormalization group techniques. Due to efficient bosonic cooling and good\ntunability this setup exhibits very good conditions for observing this strong correlation effect. In\nanticipation of experimental realizations we calculate the velocities for spin and charge perturbations\nfor a wide range of parameters.\n\nOne of the most exciting recent events is the evergrowing interplay between previously disconnected fields\nof physics, such as quantum optics and condensed matter\nphysics. In particular, cold atomic systems have opened\nthe way to engineer strongly interacting quantum manybody systems of unique purity. The unprecedented control over interaction strength and dimensionality allows\nthe realization of \"quantum simulators\" where fundamental but hard to analyze phenomena in strongly correlated systems could be observed and controlled. Examples are the observation of superfluid to Mott insulator\ntransition for Bose gases [1] and the fermionization of\nstrongly interacting one dimensional bosons [2, 3].\nAmong interacting systems, the physics depends very\nstrongly on the dimensionality. In one-dimensional systems the interactions play a major role and lead to drastically different physics than for their higher dimensional\ncounterpart. Typically, interactions in one-dimensional\nsystems lead to a Luttinger liquid state where the excitations of the system are collective excitations [4]. The\nimportance of such a state for a large variety of experimental devices in condensed matter has led to a hunt\nto observe its properties. A remarkable consequence of\nsuch a state is the absence of single particle excitations.\nThis means that a quantum particle, that would normally\ncarry both charge and spin degrees of freedom, fractionalizes into two different collective excitations, a spin and\na charge excitation. Such a fractionalization of a single particle excitation is the hallmark of collective effects\ncaused by interactions. However, just as detecting fractional excitations in the case of the quantum hall effect is\ndifficult [5], observing spin-charge separation has proven\nelusive despite several experimental attempts [6, 7, 8].\nSo far, the best experimental evidence is provided by\ntunneling between quantum wires where interferences effects are due to the existence of two different velocities\n[9]. However, in these systems it is hard to quantify or to\ntune the interaction between the particles which causes\nthe collective effects. Since control of the interaction is\na routing procedure in ultracold gases, the possible realization of the phenomenon of spin charge separation has\n\nalso been discussed in the context of cold fermionic gases\n[10, 11, 12, 13] and strongly interacting bosonic gases\n[14].\nHowever, proposals to observe spin-charge separation\nin ultracold fermionic gases are still plagued by the currently quite high temperatures in such systems. A much\nbetter setup to test for spin-charge separation would\nbe two-component Bose gases, for example using the\n|F = 2, mF = \u22121i and the |F = 1, mF = 1i hyperfine states of 87 Rb [15, 16]. Experimentally, this system retains the advantages of the fermionic ultracold\natom setup while allowing for much lower temperatures\ndue to the more efficient cooling techniques available for\nbosons. However, theoretical studies [17, 18] for onedimensional systems predict that close to the experimentally accessible parameter regime of almost equal interand intra-species interaction strength phase separation\noccurs. This is the remaining potential experimental\ncomplication in the setup.\nIn this work we demonstrate the phenomenon of spincharge separation in the experimentally relevant parameter regime, allowing to use this system to unambiguously\ntest for spin-charge separation. We calculate both the\nreal-time evolution of a single particle excitation and the\ndynamical single particle spectral function of the twocomponent bosonic systems. We show that both these\nquantities demonstrate the separation of a single-particle\nexcitation into spin and charge. We further determine\nthe velocity of spin and charge and the Luttinger parameters for experimentally relevant parameter regimes. To\nperform the calculations we use variants of the density\nmatrix renormalilzation group method (DMRG) [19, 20].\nThe numerical treatment is necessary to obtain reliable\npredictions for experimental realizations, due to the close\nproximity of this regime to phase separation.\nA one-dimensional two-component Bose gas in an optical lattice [21] can be described by the two-component\n\n\f2\nBose-Hubbard model\n\u0011 P\nP \u0010\nH = \u2212J j,\u03bd b\u2020j+1,\u03bd bj,\u03bd + h.c. + j,\u03bd\nP\nP\n+U12 j n\u0302j,1 n\u0302j,2 + j,\u03bd \u03b5j,\u03bd n\u0302j,\u03bd\n\nU\u03bd n\u0302j,\u03bd (n\u0302j,\u03bd \u22121)\n2\n\n(1)\nHere j is the site index and \u03bd = 1, 2 labels the two different hyperfine states of the system, b and b\u2020 are the\nannihilation and creation operators and n\u0302 is the number operator. The first term models the kinetic energy\nof the atoms. The intra-species interaction is described\nby the U\u03bd term. We use U := U1 = U2 as it is approximately realized for commonly used hyperfine states\nof 87 Rb [22]. The inter-species interaction is given by\nthe U12 term and the last term describes external potentials. In the following we use the dimensionless parameters u = U/J and u12 = U12 /J. We define the\n'charge' density nj,c = nj,1 + nj,2 and the 'spin' density\nnj,s = nP\nfocus on systems with average fillj,1 \u2212 nj,2 . WeP\ning n = j nj,1 /L = j nj,2 /L smaller than one particle\nper site and parameter regimes up to close to the transition to the phase separation (approximately u12 \u2248 u\n[18]). Here L is the number of sites in the system.\nIn a superfluid phase away from the transition to phase\nseparation the low energy physics can be approximated\nby a density-phase representation of the bosons as used\nin the bosonization method [4]. In this representation\nthe Hamiltonian is totally separated into one part for\nthe charge and one for the spin degrees of freedom. The\nphysics is fully determined by the velocities vc,s and\nthe so-called Luttinger parameters Kc,s for spin (s) and\ncharge (c). Therefore the separation of a single particle\nexcitation into spin and charge excitations is expected.\nThe parameters of two interacting species of bosons can\nbe related to the parameters K and v0 for the single\nspecies case [23] by\np\n(2)\nvc,s = v0 1 \u00b1 (g12 K)/(\u03c0v0 )\np\nand Kc,s = K/ 1 \u00b1 (g12 K)/(\u03c0v0 ).\nHere g12 is the interspecies interaction strength in the\ncontinous model. In the limit of small interactions, the\nsingle species parameters K and v0 can be directly related to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian Eq. (1) [4]. For\nhigher values of the interaction strength the relation even\nfor the single species situation is unkown, and has to\nbe determined numerically [24]. For large values of the\ninter-species interaction of the order of the intra-species\ninteraction the system approaches the transition to phase\nseparation and the bosonization approach becomes a priori inaccurate.\nSnapshots of the real time-evolution of a single particle excitation in a two-component bosonic system are\nshown in Fig. 1. The single particle excitation at time\nt = 0 is prepared by the application of the creation operator of one species, say 1, on site L/2 to the ground\nstate |\u03c80 i, i.e. b\u2020L/2,1 |\u03c80 i. The resulting sharp peaks in\n\nthe density distributions are shown in Fig. 1 (a). For\nt > 0 the time-evolution of the single particle excitation is calculated using the adaptive time-dependent\nDMRG [25, 26]. The time-evolution is performed using\na Krylov algorithm [27] in a matrix product state basis\nwith a fixed error bound for each timestep of the or2\nder of k|\u03a8(t + \u2206t)i \u2212 exp[\u2212iH\u2206t]|\u03a8(t)ik < 10\u22125 . The\nstepsize \u2206t = 0.2 and 6 to 10 Krylov vectors were used\nresulting in Hilbert spaces with a local dimension of a\nfew thousand states. As can be seen in the snapshots in\nFig. 1 the initial single particle excitation splits up into\ntwo counter propagating density waves. Due to their different spin and charge velocities, after a period of time\na clear separation of the density waves is seen (cf. Fig. 1\n(c)) [41].\nAdditionally to the time-evolution of a single particle excitation, we obtained the single particle spectral\n1\nbq,\u03bd i as shown\nfunction A\u03bd (q, \u03c9) = \u03c01 Ihb\u2020q,\u03bd H+\u03c9+\u0131\u03b7\u2212E\n0\nin Fig. 2. For fermions this function is known to exhibit two peaks at the spin and charge excitation energies [28, 29], showing a direct signature of the spincharge separation. For the bosons computing this spectral function is more involved and up to very recently\nit was only derived for a single component bosonic system [30, 31, 32]. An expression for the correlation functions which allow to obtain the single-particle correlation\nfunction within the bosonization treatment for a twocomponent bosonic system was derived in [33]. Power\nlaw singularities at qvc,s are obtained with respective exponents 1/4Kc,s + 1/2Ks,c \u2212 1. For the values of the\nLuttinger parameters (as shown in Fig. 2) one thus expects two divergent peaks. We show in Fig. 2 the full\nspectral function for our microscopic model, as calculated\nnumerically using a matrix product state generalization\nof the correction vector method[31, 34]. Our results show\nclearly the appearance of the two separated peaks, the\nlower representing the spin and the upper the charge excitation branch [42]. Thus both the real time evolution of\na single particle function and the single particle spectral\nfunction show clear signatures of separation of spin and\ncharge.\nTo observe the separation of spin and charge excitations experimentally in a system of ultracold bosons,\nknowledge of the spin and charge velocities is indispensable. We therefore determined the velocities for a wide\nrange of parameters. This was done calculating the timeevolution of a small spin and charge density perturbation\nrespectively. The density perturbation was created at\ntime t = 0 applying\npotential of Gaussian\n\u0010 an external\n\u0011\n(j\u2212j0 )2\nform \u03b5\u03bd,j = \u03b50 exp \u2212 2\u03c3j\nwhere \u03bd = c, s. At time\nt = 0 the potential is switched off and the time-evolution\nof the density perturbation is calculated. The errors in\nthe obtained velocities are of the order of 0.01aJ/h\u0304 for\nsmall u12 and increase with larger u12 .\nIn Fig. 3 we show the dependence of the velocities\n\n\f3\n0.6\n\nnc - 1.25\nns\n\n(a)\n1\n\n0.6\n\nnc - 1.25\nns\n\n(b)\n\nnc - 1.25\nns\n\n(c)\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\n16\nsite\n\n24\n\n32\n\n0\n\n8\n\n16\nsite\n\n24\n\n32\n\n0\n\n8\n\n16\nsite\n\n24\n\n32\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Snapshots of the time-evolution of the charge and spin density distribution of a single particle excitation\ncreated at time t = 0h\u0304/J; (a) at time t = 0h\u0304/J, (b) at time t = 1.5h\u0304/J and (c) at time t = 2.5h\u0304/J.

Two peaks corresponding to the spin and the\ncharge excitation can be distinguished. The following parameters were used n = 0.625, u = 3, u12 = 2.1 on a system with\nL = 64 sites and a broadening \u03b7 = 0.1. Here a is the lattice\nspacing.\n\non the inter-species interaction for two different values\nof the parameter \u03b3 = u/(2nc). For both parameter\nregimes, the charge velocity increases with increasing interaction whereas the spin velocity descreases. For a\nvanishing inter-species interaction it was shown in [24]\nthat for \u03b3 < 1 the bosonization and the solution of the\nexactly solvable Lieb-Liniger model agree approximately\nwith the velocities in the Bose-Hubbard model. In Fig. 3\n(a) we find for \u03b3 \u2248 1.1 very good agreement with the\nanalytical solutions even up to strong inter-species interaction strength u12 close to phase separation. For\n\u03b3 \u2248 2.4 [cf. Fig. 3 (b)] even for vanishing interspecies interaction the deviations from the direct relation between\nthe parameters in the Bose-Hubbard model are considerable (cf. [24]). However, we find that the dependence\nof the velocities on the interspecies interaction strength\nvia Eq.( 2) is still a good approximation correcting by\nthe numerically determined value for v0 and K. This\nholds even up to close to the regime of phase separation, i.e. u12 \u2248 u where the difference in the velocities is\nmaximal. However, for u12 \u2248 u the results for the spin\nvelocity start to deviate for both values of \u03b3.\n\nIn Fig. 4 we show for two different fixed inter-species\ninteraction strengths the dependence of the velocities on\nthe density. The charge and the spin velocities rise with\nincreasing background charge density. (Note, even at\nnc = 1 the system is in the superfluid regime.) The\nincrease of the velocities is described to good accuracy\nusing the analytical form Eq. (2), provided we use numerically obtained values of K and v0 . For large u12\nand small nc the results for the velocities from DRMG,\nin particular the spin velocity, deviate considerably from\nEq. (2), showing that the approximate relation cannot\nbe used in this regime. Note that in this regime the\nextraction of the spin velocity from the real-time evolution becomes also more involved since the spin perturbation shows a strong spreading in space (cf. [35]). At\nthe timescales over which we calculated the velocity, the\nleft- and the right-moving spin perturbations are not yet\nfully separated and show strong amplitude damping. Our\nfinding of the dependencies can be used to predict the velocities for experimentally interesting parameter regimes.\nIn recent experiments for the preparation of a mixture\nof two bosonic components in optical lattices mostly two\nhyperfine states of 87 Rb are used, e.g. the |F = 2, mF =\n\u22121i and the |F = 1, mF = 1i hyperfine states. The\nintra-species scattering lengths are a2 = 91.28aB and\na1 = 100.4aB [22], respectively where aB is the Bohr radius. For these states the inter-species scattering length\nis of the same order of magnitude as the intra-species\nscattering length and can be tuned about 20% using a\nFeshbach resonance [15, 16]. Thereby the experimental parameters are close to the competing phase separation regime. These mixtures can be confined to onedimensional structures using strongly anisotropic lattices\n[2, 3, 36, 37]. The most intuitive observation of the phenomenon of spin-charge separation in these systems is\nto generate a single particle excitation and then follow\nthe evolution of the excitation in real time. This can be\ndone measuring the spin-resolved density over a certain\nregion. The creation of a single particle excitation can\n\n\f4\nperfine state to e.g. the |F = 2, mF = 2i. This has the\nadvantage that scattering with the |F = 1, mF = 1i state\nare supressed. The measurement of the density resolved\nover a region of approximately 10 lattice sites can then be\nperformed using again the magnetic field gradient to get\nan unambigious signal. In an array of one-dimensional\ntubes the broadening of the signal caused by the trapping potential could be suppressed by preparing most of\nthe tubes in a Mott-insulating state as shown in [12].\n\n3\n(a)\n\nv\n\n2\n\n1\nDMRG: charge\nDMRG: spin\nBosonization\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nu12\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nWe would like to thank J.S.
