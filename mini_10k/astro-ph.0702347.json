INTRODUCTION\n\nA mid-Galactic latitude pulsar survey with the Parkes\nRadio Telescope (Crawford et al. 2006) detected three\nnew pulsars in binary systems, none of which easily\nfits within the standard evolutionary scenarios proposed\nfor the majority of recycled pulsars. One of them,\nPSR J1744\u22123922, was independently discovered during\nthe reprocessing of the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey data (Faulkner et al. 2004). This 172-ms binary pulsar has a relatively high surface dipole magnetic field\nstrength (B \u2261 3.2 \u00d7 1019 (P \u1e56 )1/2 G = 1.7 \u00d7 1010 G) suggesting it is mildly recycled. However, it appears to have\na very light companion (minimum mass 0.085 M\u2299 ) in\na tight and nearly circular 4.6-hr orbit (see Table 1).\nThis type of orbit and companion are typical of those of\nfully recycled pulsars (which we define as pulsars with\nP . 8 ms and B . 109 G) with He white dwarf (WD)\ncompanions. Thus, why PSR J1744\u22123922 escaped being\nfully recycled is a puzzle.\nIn addition to this atypical combination of spin and orbital properties, PSR J1744\u22123922 exhibits strong pulsed\nradio flux modulations, making the pulsar undetectable\n1 Department\nof Physics, Rutherford Physics Building,\nMcGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2T8, Canada; bretonr@physics.mcgill.ca\n2 Eureka Scientific, Inc., 2452 Delmer Street Suite 100 Oakland,\nCA 94602-3017\n3 National Radio Astronomy Observatory, 520 Edgemont Road,\nCharlottesville, VA 22903\n4 Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of\nToronto, 60 St. George Street, Toronto, ON M5S 3H8, Canada\n5 D\u00e9partement de Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, C.P. 6128,\nSucc.

It has been suggested by\nFaulkner et al. (2004) that this behavior might be the\nnulling phenomenon seen in a handful of slow, isolated\npulsars. Nulling is a broad-band, if not total, interruption of the radio emission for a temporary period of time.\nOn the other hand, although nulling could affect pulsars\nin binary systems as well, many binary pulsars vary due\nto external effects such as eclipses. Such external effects\nmight explain PSR J1744\u22123922's variability as well.\nIn this paper, we first report on multi-frequency observations of this pulsar that suggest the radio variability\nis not intrinsic to the pulsar. However, our analysis does\nnot show strong evidence of a correlation between radio\nflux and orbital phase, as one might expect from traditional eclipse-like variability. We then report on our\ninfrared search for a counterpart of the companion using\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). This observation has identified a K\u2032 = 19.30(15) star at the position determined by the radio timing observations. Finally, we examine why other properties of this pulsar\nmake it incompatible with standard evolutionary scenarios, and identify a few other systems which have similar\ncharacteristics. The addition of PSR J1744\u22123922 as an\nextreme case among this group motivates us to identify\na possible new class of binary pulsars. We propose several possible evolutionary channels which might produce\nmembers of this class and explain how the nature of the\ncompanion to PSR J1744\u22123922 could be used to constrain the origin of these systems.\n2. PULSED RADIO FLUX VARIABILITY\n\nThe observed average pulsed radio emission from a pulsar can fluctuate for several different reasons. These\ninclude effects from the pulsar itself, as in nulling\n\n\f2\n\nBreton et al.\n\n(e.g. Backer 1970), its environment, as in eclipsing binary pulsars (e.g. Fruchter, Stinebring & Taylor 1988),\nor the interstellar medium, as in scintillation (e.g. Rickett\n1970). In the case of PSR J1744\u22123922, during a typical 1400 MHz observation, the radio emission seems to\nturn on and off randomly on timescales varying from\ntens of seconds to tens of minutes (see Figure 1 for\nsample folded profiles). In many instances, the pulsar\nis undetectable through entire observations (\u223c 15 min).\nIn a previous analysis of these radio flux modulations,\nFaulkner et al. (2004) concluded on the basis of observations at 1400 MHz that PSR J1744\u22123922 is probably\na pulsar experiencing pulse nulls. As nulling is a broadband phenomenon (e.g. Bartel et al. 1981), we decided to\ninvestigate the frequency dependence of the fluctuations\nin order to test the nulling hypothesis.\n2.1. Data and Procedure\n\nThe work we report is based on an extended\ndataset combining both the data reported independently by Faulkner et al. (2004) and by Ransom et al.\n(in prep.). A total of 112 radio timing observations of\nPSR J1744\u22123922 were made at the 64-meter Parkes Telescope and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope between\n2003 June and 2006 January. Relevant details for the\ncurrent study are summarized in Table 2 and we refer to\nthe above two papers for more details about the observational setups and timing results.\nFor the purpose of studying the radio emission variability, we made time series of the pulsed flux intensity. We\ndedispersed the data at the pulsar's dispersion measure\n(DM) of 148.5 pc cm\u22123 and then folded the resulting time\nseries in 10-s intervals using the timing ephemerides from\nRansom et al. (in prep.). For each observation, the pulse\nphase was determined from the profile averaged over the\nentire observation. We fit each 10-s interval of the folded\npulse profile with a constant baseline plus a Gaussian of\nvariable amplitude having a fixed width at the predetermined phase. A Gaussian FWHM=0.01964P , where P\nis the pulse period, nicely fits the profile averaged over\nmany observations in the frequency range 680-4600 MHz.\nErrors on the best-fit amplitudes returned by our leastsquare minimization procedure were scaled under the assumption that the off-pulse region RMS represents the\ntotal system noise. Although no flux standard has been\nobserved, we obtained pulsed flux density estimates by\nusing the radiometer equation and equating predicted\nnoise levels to the off-pulse RMS level. We also accounted\nfor the offset between the telescope pointing and the real\nposition of the source (since in the early observations the\nbest-fit timing position had not yet been determined)\nby approximating the telescope sensitivity to be an azimuthally symmetric Gaussian having a FWHM corresponding to the radio telescope beam size, which is 8.8\u2032\nand 13.8\u2032 at 1400 MHz for GBT and Parkes, respectively.\nIn this way, we generated flux time series for all 112\nobservations of PSR J1744\u22123922 (see Figure 2 for examples). As we describe next, these results show that\nscintillation and nulling are highly unlikely to be the origin of the observed variability.\n2.2. Radio-frequency-dependent Variability\n\nAs Faulkner et al. (2004) discussed previously, interstellar scintillation (ISS) is unlikely to be the source of\n\nfluctuations in PSR J1744\u22123922. Scintillation is produced by a diffractive scattering medium along our line\nof sight and the typical diffractive scintillation timescale\ncan be expressed as (see Cordes & Rickett 1998):\n\u2206td = 2.53 \u00d7 104\n\nD\u2206\u03bdd\ns,\n\u03bdVISS\n\n(1)\n\nwith D the distance to the source in kpc, \u2206\u03bdd the decorrelation bandwidth in MHz, \u03bd the observed frequency in\nGHz and VISS the velocity of ISS diffraction pattern in\nkm s\u22121 . For the 1400 MHz observation shown in Figure\n1, for example, the NE2001 model for the Galactic distribution of free electrons (Cordes & Lazio 2002) predicts\n\u2206\u03bdd = 0.01 MHz in the line of sight of PSR J1744\u22123922\nat a distance of 3.0 kpc estimated from the DM. VISS is\ntypically dominated by the pulsar velocities, which are\nin the range 10-100 km s\u22121 for most binaries. Therefore,\nwe estimate the scintillation timescale to be of the order\nof a few seconds to a minute at most. This could be compatible with the fast flux variations but can certainly not\nexplain the extended periods where the pulsar goes undetected. Perhaps most importantly, strong scintillations\nwill be averaged away since typical observing bandwidths\nare much larger than the decorrelation bandwidth, and\ntherefore contain many \"scintles\". Such averaging effectively rules out the ISS hypothesis.\nAnother possibility is that the flux modulation is related to intrinsic nulling of the pulsar. Based on observations at 1400 MHz only, Faulkner et al. (2004) identified\nit as the most likely explanation. Only observed in old,\nisolated pulsars so far, (though nothing prevents a binary\npulsar from being a nuller) nulling is a broad-band, if not\ntotal, interruption of the radio emission (e.g. Bartel et al.\n1981).\nConsidering the fraction of observations with no detection of radio emission at various frequencies (see Table 3),\nwe note qualitatively that PSR J1744\u22123922 is regularly\nundetectable at low frequencies but easily detectable at\nhigh. For instance, we obtained four Parkes observations at 680 and 2900 MHz simultaneously in which the\npulsar is detected twice at 2900 MHz while remaining undetected at 680 MHz. In addition, seven long GBT observations centered at 1850 and 1950 MHz show highly\nvariable emission but little evidence that the pulsar ever\ndisappears completely (see Figure 2). Clearly, however,\nobservations could be biased by the relative instrumental\nsensitivity in each band and by the intrinsic spectrum of\nthe pulsar.\nTo investigate the effect of instrumental sensitivity and\nspectral energy distribution, we analysed the pulsed flux\ndensities at different frequencies. Measured values were\nestimated using the radiometer equation as explained in\nSection 2.1 and are displayed in Table 4. We note that\nFaulkner et al. (2004) reported a different flux density\nthan ours at 1400 MHz (0.20(3) vs. 0.11(3) mJy, respectively). The discrepancy could be because the average\nflux density changes depending on the amount of time\nPSR J1744\u22123922 spends in its \"bright state\" during an\nobservation. The large standard deviation (0.16 mJy, see\nTable 4) at this frequency suggests that by restricting the\ncalculation to observations for which PSR J1744\u22123922 is\nnicely detected, a higher flux value can be obtained.\nFor the simultaneous observations at 680 and\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\n2900 MHz in which the pulsar was not detected at\n680 MHz (see Table 2), we can put an interesting approximate lower limit on the spectral index, \u03b1, of the\npulsar if we assume that the minimum detectable pulsed\nflux at 680 MHz is an upper limit to the pulsed flux at\nthis frequency:\n\u03b1&\n\nlog(S2900 /S680 )\n\u2243 0.17 .\nlog(\u03bd2900 /\u03bd680 )\n\n(2)\n\nSuch a value is extremely flat compared to that of\nthe average population of pulsars, which has a spectral\nindex of \u22121.8 \u00b1 0.2 (Maron et al. 2000). Thus either\nPSR J1744\u22123922 has a spectrum very different from\nthose of most pulsars and/or the flux variability is intrinsically frequency dependent.\nThe distribution of pulsed flux density values for all\n1400 and 1950 MHz observations is shown in Figure 3. It\nis clear from the distribution at 1400 MHz that the numerous non-detections are responsible for the peak below the sensitivity threshold. We also observe that the\n1400 MHz flux density has a higher average value and is\nmuch more variable than at 1950 MHz. This frequency\ndependence suggests some sort of scattering mechanism\nwith the unscattered flux level much higher than the observed average flux at 1400 MHz, and argues against it\nbeing classical nulling. Therefore, we conclude that this\nunknown mechanism affecting the lower frequency flux\nmight be responsible for the apparent flat spectrum derived from the simultaneous 680-2900 MHz observation.\nRecent simultaneous multi-frequency observations of\nPSR B1133+16, a well-established nuller, show that single pulse nulls do not always happen simultaneously at\nall frequencies (Bhat et al. 2006). They also observe,\nhowever, that the overall null fraction does not present\nany evidence of frequency dependence, which might mean\nthat sometimes nulls are simply delayed at some frequencies. In the case of PSR J1744\u22123922, the S/N limits\nus to consider the pulsed flux over times corresponding to many pulse periods only. Therefore, the kind\nof non-simultaneous, frequency-dependent effect seen by\nBhat et al. (2006) is not relevant to our analysis and thus\nwe expect the variability to be independent of frequency\nif really caused by nulling.\nAlthough our flux measurements at other frequencies\nare not simultaneous, we can assume they are good statistical estimates of the normal flux of the pulsar and\nuse them to characterize its spectrum. In an attempt to\nestimate an unbiased spectral index, we can use the approximate maximum flux value at each frequency. The\n1400, 1850, 1950, 2900 and 4600 MHz data give a spectral index lying between \u22121.5 and \u22123.0, which is similar\nto many known pulsars. However, it seems that the flux\nat 820 MHz is much smaller than expected from a single power-law spectrum. Since flux variations are very\nimportant at low frequency and we only have a single\ndetection at 820 MHz, the reported maximum value is\nprobably not representative of the real flux of the pulsar\nat this frequency.\nIn summary, the facts that the pulsar radio emission\nrarely drops below our detection threshold at 1950 MHz\nand that the radio variability is frequency dependent,\ndemonstrate that the flux modulation is probably not\nclassical nulling. A non-nulling origin for the fluctuations\n\n3\n\nat 1400 MHz also explains why PSR J1744\u22123922 does\nnot fit in with expectations based on the correlations\nobserved between null fraction and spin period (Biggs\n1992), and between null fraction and equivalent pulse\nwidth (Li & Wang 1995). In comparison with nullers, it\nhas one of the smallest spin periods and a small pulse\nwidth (\u223c 3.4 ms), but one of the largest \"null\" fractions\n(\u223c 60% at 1400 MHz). Since this pulsar is in a tight binary system, the possibility of influence by its companion\nis therefore an important alternative to consider.\n2.3. Orbital Correlation Analysis\n\nEven though a quick examination of the time series confirms that the flux decreases observed for\nPSR J1744\u22123922 are not due to systematic eclipses of\nthe pulsar by its companion, a more subtle orbital correlation could exist. To search for such an effect, we ask\nwhether or not the pulsar is more likely to be detected\nat a particular orbital phase. For this analysis, we folded\nthe time series in 1-min intervals, and defined the pulse\nas detected if the best-fit Gaussian amplitude was greater\nthan its 1\u03c3 uncertainty. In order to limit spectral effects,\nwe restrict the analysis to observations covering the range\n1237.5\u20131516.5 MHz at Parkes7 and 1404.5\u20131497.5 MHz at\nGBT.\nThe results of this analysis are shown in Figure 4a.\nThe histogram represents the fraction of detected pulses\nwith respect to the total number observed, as a function\nof orbital phase. Errors were determined using Poisson\nstatistics, implicitly assuming our assigning of each interval as a detection or non-detection is accurate. There is\na suggestion that PSR J1744\u22123922 is more often undetectable between phases \u223c 0.05 \u2212 0.45. The best-fit constant model gives a \u03c72 /9 = 5.85 (the histogram has 10\norbital phase bins), which, if correct, would be highly significant. To test the accuracy of our errors, we performed\na Monte Carlo simulation consisting of 10000 trials where\nwe assigned each measurement a random orbital phase.\nThe mean \u03c72 /9 = 0.37 with a standard deviation of 0.18,\nsuggesting our error estimates are significantly overestimated.\nTo investigate further, we performed an analysis similar to the previous one but for the pulsed flux density\nmeasured at each orbital phase averaged over all observations. We selected two subsets of data: the Parkes and\nGBT observations made at 1400 MHz and the GBT 1950\nMHz observations. The first one includes 101 observations which are on average \u223c 15 minutes long, but there\nare a few observations which are significantly longer. The\nlatter subset includes four observations, two of which\nhave full orbital coverage, one covering \u223c 75% of the\norbit and the last one \u223c 40%. Observations with no\ndetection of PSR J1744\u22123922 are assigned upper limit\nvalues of three times the background noise level (which\nis very small compared with the average pulse of the\npulsar when it is on). Errors in each bin of the histogram are estimated from the RMS of the individual\nvalues in each orbital bin. Results are plotted in Figure\n4b. For the 1400 MHz data, a fit to a constant line has\na \u03c72 /9 = 15.58, and for the GBT 1950 MHz data, we\nfind a \u03c72 /9 = 5.59. Randomizing the individual data\n7 This is the common range of the observing modes centered at\n1375 and 1400 MHz.\n\n\f4\n\nBreton et al.\n\npoints and folding them resulted in a \u03c72 /9 = 1.02 at\nboth frequencies, suggesting our error estimates are reasonable. Although this analysis strongly rules out the\nconstant model for our folded light curves, the shapes\nof these curves at 1400 and 1950 MHz are not consistent\nwith each other.\nThis could be a result of the paucity of observations\n(typically 3\u20135) at any given orbital phase. Therefore,\nrandom fluctuations in the flux on timescales of tens of\nminutes (which we see in the time series) would likely not\nbe averaged out. To test whether or not the significant\ndeviation from a constant model depends on the particular phasing of our observations, we again performed\nMonte Carlo simulations in which 10000 trial histograms\nsimilar to those shown in Figure 4 were generated from\nthe real data by adding a random orbital phase shift at\nthe beginning of each time series and then determining\nthe \u03c72 /9 value for a constant model. From the resulting distribution of \u03c72 /9 values, we estimate the chance\nprobability of obtaining the particular \u03c72 /9 values obtained, or higher, using the real orbital phases. For\nthe on-off analysis, the probability is 0.102, or a formal\n\u03c72 /9 = 1.63. For the 1400 and 1950 MHz flux density\nlight curves, the probabilities are 0.015 (\u03c72 /9 = 2.28)\nand 0.212 (\u03c72 /9 = 1.34). This suggests there may be\nsome correlation with the orbit, but the shape of our\nfolded light curves are still dominated by more stochastic flux variations given our limited data set. We would\nexpect a standard eclipse mechanism to make the pulsar\ndimmer when the companion is in front of it at phase\n0.25, which does not seem to be the case. There may\nbe large orbit to orbit variations in the eclipse depths,\ndurations, and phases. This kind of behavior has been\nobserved in other binary pulsar systems such as Ter5A,\nTer5P, Ter5ad and NGC6397A (see Ransom et al. 2005;\nHessels et al. 2006; D'Amico et al. 2001, for examples),\nbut a much larger data set would be required to obtain a\nreliable average light curve to show if this is the case for\nPSR J1744\u22123922. It is still possible that the short time\nscale pulsed flux variations tend to group in \"events\" during which the pulse gets dimmer. These \"events\" may\nlast for a significant fraction of the orbital phase causing the apparent marginal orbital correlation given our\nlimited statistics.\n\ncase, some kind of tidal stripping could be occuring,\nleaving material around the system. This could explain\nwhy the pulsar does not disappear at conjunction like\nPSR B1718\u221219 does, but in a more stochastic way.\nIf the companion is losing mass, one might expect to\nobserve small changes in the orbital parameters. From\nradio timing (see Ransom et al. in prep.), we can set an\nupper limit of |\u1e56orb | < 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 s s\u22121 and |\u1e8b| < 7 \u00d7\n10\u221212 lt-s s\u22121 on the rate of change of the orbital period\nand the rate of change of the projected semi-major axis,\nrespectively. We can use the latter quantity to evaluate\nthe implied mass loss limit. For a circular orbit, which\nis a good approximation here, we can express the rate of\nchange of the semi-major axis as (Verbunt 1993):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2Mc\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)Mc\nJ \u0307\n\u1e40c\nMp\n\u0227\n1\u2212\n,\n\u2212\n= 2 \u22122\n\u2212 \u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\na\nJ\nMc\nMp\n2(Mp + Mc )\nMp + Mc\n(3)\nwhere x = a sin i, \u1e8b = \u0227 sin i, Mc and Mp are the mass of\nthe companion and the pulsar, respectively, J is the total\nangular momentum of the system, \u03b2 is the fraction of\nmass accreted by the pulsar and \u03b1 is the specific angular\nmomentum of the mass lost in units of the companion\nstar's specific angular momentum.\nFor the case in which the total orbital angular momentum of the system is preserved (J \u0307 = 0) we can see\nthat mass loss from the companion8 (\u1e40c < 0) would\nnecessarily lead to a widening (\u0227/a > 0) of the orbit\nif: 1) the mass transfer is conservative (\u03b2 = 1), or\n2) the mass transfer is non-conservative (\u03b2 < 1) and\n\u03b1 < 1 + Mc /(2Mp ) (see Verbunt 1993, for more details).\nBy considering the conservative case, in which |\u1e40c | =\n|\u1e40p |, we obtain an upper limit on a possible mass accretion rate by the pulsar |\u1e40p | . 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nThis would be even lower for the non-conservative case.\nAccretion onto the pulsar is possible if the corotation\nradius:\n1/3\n\n2/3\nrco \u2243 500Ppsr\nM1.4\n\n(4)\n\nis larger than the magnetospheric radius of the pulsar:\nrmag \u2243 800\n\n2.4. Accretion and mass loss limits\n\nMany other systems are known to exhibit strong\nflux radio variations for which the orbital dependence\nis well established. One of them is PSR B1718\u221219\n(Lyne et al. 1993). Interestingly, this pulsar has a lowmass companion and orbital properties similar to those\nof PSR J1744\u22123922 and is also harder to detect at low\nfrequency. At 408 and 606 MHz, PSR B1718\u221219 gets\nso dim that it is barely detectable in spite of good sensitivity during a large part of the orbit. On the other\nhand, at 1404 and 1660 MHz the orbital modulation of\nthe average flux is much less important. This flickering is probably made by material left over by the wind\nof the companion, a bloated main sequence (MS) star\n(Janssen & van Kerkwijk 2005). Although the companion of PSR B1718\u221219 is not large enough to come near\nto filling its Roche-lobe, this could happen in a tighter\nbinary system like that of PSR J1744\u22123922. In this\n\nkm,\n\n4\n12\nBpsr\nR10\n2\nM1.4 \u1e40\u221212\n\n!1/7\n\nkm,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ppsr and Bpsr are, respectively, the spin period and the surface dipole magnetic field in units of\nPSR J1744\u22123922's P and B (172 ms and 1.68 \u00d7 1010 G);\nM1.4 is the mass of the pulsar in units of 1.4 M\u2299 ; R10 is\nthe radius of the pulsar in units of 10 km; and \u1e40\u221212 is\nthe accretion rate in units of 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Given the\nupper limit on the mass accretion rate, and the likely\nconservative R10 = 1 value for the neutron star radius,\nwe find that rmag (& 600 km) is likely larger than rco\n(\u223c 500 km). This argues against any significant accretion occuring in the system.\nThat no significant accretion is occuring is also supported by an XMM-Newton observation that allows\nRansom et al. (in prep.) to put a conservative upper\n8\n\nHere we implicitly assume that Mc < Mp .\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\nlimit \u223c 2 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 on the unabsorbed X-ray flux\nfrom accretion in the 0.1-10 keV range. Assuming\n\u03b7GM \u1e40\n,\n(6)\nR\nwith a conversion efficiency of accretion energy into observed X-rays \u03b7 = 0.1, we get \u1e40p . 2 \u00d7 10\u221214 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nfor accretion at the surface of the pulsar and \u1e40p .\n2.4 \u00d7 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 if accretion is limited to the boundary of the magnetospheric radius. Therefore, it appears\nunlikely that PSR J1744\u22123922 is accreting and, if the\ncompanion is losing mass, it is probably expelled away\nfrom the system.\nLX =\n\n3. INFRARED OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe radio flux variability, which might be due to material leaving the surface of the companion, and the atypical evolutionary characteristics of the pulsar (see Section\n4) can be investigated further by observing its companion\nat optical or near-infrared wavelengths. We imaged the\nfield of PSR J1744\u22123922 at K\u2032 -band on the night of 2005\nApril 19 using the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6-m Telescope (CFHT) at Mauna Kea. The telescope is equipped\nwith the Adaptive Optic Bonette (AOB, Rigaut et al.\n1998), which provides good correction for atmospheric\nseeing, and KIR, the 1024\u00d71024 pixel HAWAII infrared\ndetector with 0.\u2032\u2032 0348 pixel scale. The total integration\ntime was 30 s\u00d759 integrations = 1770 s.\nWe substracted a dark frame from each image, and\nthen constructed a flat-field image from the median of\nthe science frames. The images were then flat-fielded,\nregistered and stacked to make the final image. The final\nstellar profile has a FWHM of 0.\u2032\u2032 17, degraded somewhat\nfrom the optimal correction provided by the AOB system\ndue to a high airmass (\u223c 2.0) and poor natural seeing.\nFigure 5 shows the final image we obtained.\nWe analyzed the final CFHT image using the standard\nroutine daophot (Stetson 1987) for PSF fitting photometry, and calibrated the image using the standard star\nFS34 (Casali & Hawarden 1992). To find the photometric zero point, we performed photometry on the standard\nstar with a large aperture containing most of the flux,\nand applied an aperture correction for the PSF stars in\nthe science image. Careful calibration of measurement\nerrors has been done by adding artificial stars of known\nmagnitude to blank parts of the image and then measuring their magnitude through the PSF fitting process\nalong with the real stars. Thus, errors on the magnitude\nreturned by daophot can be rescaled by calculating the\nstandard deviation for the added stars.\nWe found the astrometric solution for the image by\ncross-identifying five stars with the 2MASS catalogue\n(Skrutskie et al. 2006), fitting for scale, rotation and displacement. The final astrometric uncertainty is 0.\u2032\u2032 34\nat the 3\u03c3 confidence level. This value depends on the\nmatching to the reference stars because the error on\nthe radio timing position of PSR J1744\u22123922 is negligible, (\u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 03). The final image is displayed in Figure\n5, with the positional error circle centered at the radio\nposition of PSR J1744\u22123922: \u03b1 = 17h 44m 02.s 667(1) and\n\u03b4 = \u221239\u25e6 22\u2032 21.\u2032\u2032 52(5). Only one star falls inside this circle, and for this we measure K\u2032 = 19.30(15). We observe\nthat, above the 3\u03c3 detection limit, the average stellar\n\n5\n\ndensity is 0.079 arcsec\u22122 and hence the probability of a\nstar falling in the error circle is only 2.9 %. Due to its\npositional coincidence and the low probability of chance\nsuperposition, we henceforth refer to this object as the\npossible counterpart to PSR J1744\u22123922.\nUnfortunately our near-infrared observation does not\ntightly constrain the nature of the companion to\nPSR J1744\u22123922, mainly because of the uncertainties in\nthe distance to the system and in the companion mass, as\nwell as the fact that its temperature is unknown. Assuming the NE2001 (Cordes & Lazio 2002) electron density\nmodel is correct, we infer a DM distance of 3.0 \u00b1 0.6 kpc\nand hence a distance modulus ranging from 11.9 to 12.8.\nUsing the three-dimensional Galactic extinction model\nof Drimmel et al. (2003) we get a value of AV \u2243 1.9 for\na distance of 3.0 kpc. Converting9 the inferred extinction to K\u2032 band gives AK \u2032 \u2243 0.21 (see Rieke & Lebofsky\n1985, for conversion factors). Therefore the estimated\nabsolute magnitude of the counterpart lies in the range\nMK \u2032 \u2243 [6.1, 7.4].\nWe can evaluate how probable it is that the companion is a He WD, a typical low-mass companion in binary pulsar systems, since WD cooling models can put\nrestrictions on the stellar mass and cooling age, given\nan observed flux. Figure 6 shows the absolute K\u2032 magnitude as a function of cooling age for He WDs of different masses. These cooling tracks were made by using WD atmosphere models based on the calculations\nof Bergeron et al. (1995), and thereafter improved by\nBergeron et al. (2001) and Bergeron (2001), in combination with evolution sequences calculated by Driebe et al.\n(1999). Although the mass range of models available to\nus does not go below 0.179 M\u2299 , we can deduce that to\nbe so luminous, a He WD would need to have a very low\nmass and a cooling age much lower than the characteristic age of the pulsar (1.7 Gyr). Even if the mass were\nequal to the lower limit of 0.08 M\u2299 derived from radio\ntiming, it seems unlikely that such a companion could\nbe as old as the pulsar characteristic age. Therefore, if\nthe companion is indeed a He WD, the pulsar's spin period must be close to the equilibrium spin frequency it\nreached at the end of the recycling process. In this case,\nits characteristic age is an overestimate of its true age.\nAnother possibility is that the companion is not a He\nWD. If the companion is a low-mass main sequence (MS)\nstar, then the minimum mass required to match the lower\nlimit on the absolute K\u2032 flux is \u223c 0.25 M\u2299 , regardless\nof the pulsar age. Such a companion mass requires a\nfavorable face-on orbit but this cannot be ruled out from\nthe near-infrared and radio data. On the other hand, a\nlower-mass bloated MS star could be equally as bright,\nso is also a possibility.\nWe cannot constrain the nature of the counterpart very\nwell from a measurement in a single near-infrared filter.\nIdeally, obtaining a spectrum could yield: 1) a precise\ndetermination of the nature of the counterpart, 2) orbital\nDoppler shift measurements of the spectral lines which\ncan prove the association as well as determine the mass\nratio, 3) in the case of a white dwarf, an estimate of its\ncooling age from spectral line fitting.\n9 For simplicity, and because the error on the magnitude is dominated by the distance estimate, we hereafter assume that K and\nK\u2032 are similar.\n\n\f6\n\nBreton et al.\n4. BINARY PULSAR EVOLUTION\n\nThe sporadic radio emission from PSR J1744\u22123922 is\nnot the only indication that there is something unusual\nabout the pulsar's interaction with its companion. The\npulsar is in a tight and low eccentricity (e < 0.001) orbit with an apparently very light companion having a\nminimum mass of 0.08 M\u2299 . On the other hand it has a\nrelatively large surface magnetic field (1.7 \u00d7 1010 G) and\nan extremely long spin period (172 ms) compared with\nother binary pulsars having low-mass companions (see,\ne.g., Stairs 2004; van Kerkwijk et al. 2004, for recent reviews). These properties, along with the relatively bright\nnear-infrared counterpart of the companion, make it unusual and suggest it evolved differently than most binary\npulsars.\nIn binary pulsar evolution, the nature of the companion\nplays a key role in determining the final spin and orbital\ncharacteristics of the system. Most of the binary pulsar\npopulation consists of pulsars with low-mass companions\nin low-eccentricity orbits. Following the nomenclature\nadopted by Stairs (2004), the case A evolutionary channel results in pulsars having He WD companions. They\nare neutron stars (NS) which were spun up to very short\nperiods (P . 8 ms) after accreting matter from a lowmass star during a long and steady Roche-lobe overflow\n(RLO) phase (Tauris & Savonije 1999). For reasons that\nare not yet understood, this process is responsible for the\npartial suppression of the surface magnetic field to values of the order of 108\u22129 G. The most robust predictions\nof this model are the correlations linking the orbital period to the mass of the He WD (Rappaport et al. 1995)\n(see Figure 7) and the eccentricity to the orbital period\n(Phinney 1992).\nOn the other hand, the case B channel is made of\npulsars having more massive CO WD or ONeMg WD\ncompanions (Mc & 0.45M\u2299 ). Their intermediate mass\nprogenitors did not sustain a stable RLO phase, instead\nevolving in a short-duration, non-conservative, common\nenvelope (CE) phase during which the pulsar spiraled\ninto its companion's envelope. This process only partly\nrecycled the pulsar, leading to intermediate spin periods (P & 8 ms) and leaving a higher magnetic field\n(\u223c 109\u221210 G).\nIn Table 5, the expected properties of systems resulting\nfrom these two evolutionary channels are compared with\nthose of PSR J1744\u22123922. Both scenarios fail to account\nfor all the observed characteristics; this suggests a special evolution for PSR J1744\u22123922. This can also be seen\nfrom a P \u2212B diagram (Figure 8a) made for binary pulsars\nin the Galactic field having circular orbits. As opposed to\nisolated and other kinds of non-recycled binary pulsars,\nthere exists a very strong relationship linking P and B\nwhich is presumably related to the recycling process. To\nour knowledge, such a correlation has not been reported\nin the recent literature although was indirectly found by\nvan den Heuvel & Bitzaraki (1995) who reported a possible correlation between P \u2212 Porb and B \u2212 Porb for binary pulsars in circular orbits. The many binary pulsars discovered in recent years may be making it easier\nto appreciate. In Figure 8a we see that pulsars having\nlight companions (case A) generally gather in the region\nof low magnetic field and short spin period whereas the\ncase B pulsars lie in higher-valued regions. Surprisingly,\n\nof the six highest magnetic field pulsars, five of them,\nincluding PSR J1744\u22123922, have light companions. The\nremaining one, PSR B0655+64, is an extreme system\nassociated with the case B channel since it has a massive WD companion (van Kerkwijk et al. 2004). However, the case B channel cannot accommodate the other\nfive pulsars because, assuming random orbital inclinations, a simple statistical estimate gives less than a 0.1 %\nprobability for all of them to be more massive than the\nrequired 0.45 M\u2299 . For PSR J1744\u22123922 in particular,\nthe orbital inclination would need to be less than 12.5\u25e6 ,\nwhich represents a 2.5% probability.\nWe also report in Table 5 the principal characteristics\nof binary pulsars that appear to be partly recycled (e.g.\nP > 8 ms and e < 0.01) but have companions likely not\nmassive enough to be explained by the standard case B\nscenario. These pulsars have related properties and could\nhave experienced similar evolutionary histories. Apart\nfrom their strange position in the P \u2212 B diagram, they\nalso stand out when we look at the Porb \u2212 P relationship (Figure 8b). In this plot, we see that pulsars having\nlow-mass companions (case A) occupy the bottom region, below P . 8 ms, and their spin periods are more or\nless independent of the orbital period. This arises from\nthe fact that recycling probably saturates for a given accretion rate and/or accretion mass (Konar & Choudhuri\n2004). On the other hand, fewer constraints exist in\nthis parameter space for pulsars with massive WD companions (case B ). Their short CE evolution would limit\nthe recycling efficiency and thus the final parameters are\nmore sensitive to the initial conditions. Finally, we observe a third category made of relatively slow pulsars\nwith low-mass companions in compact orbits. Neither\nthe case A nor the case B scenarios is able to explain\nsuch properties, especially for the most extreme systems\nlike PSR J1744\u22123922 and PSR B1831\u221200. Therefore,\nwe suggest a new \"class\" of binary pulsars having the\nfollowing properties: 1) long spin periods (in comparison\nto MSPs), 2) large surface magnetic fields (\u223c 1010\u221211 G),\n3) low-mass companions, likely 0.08 \u2212 0.3 M\u2299 , having\nnature yet to be determined, 4) low eccentricities, and\npossibly 5) short orbital periods (. 5 d). On this last\npoint, very wide orbit systems like PSR B1800\u221227 and\nPSR J0407+1607 might be explained by the standard\ncase A scenario in which it is difficult to achieve an extended period of mass transfer from the companion to\nthe pulsar.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nThe existence of another \"class\" of binary pulsars\nis supported by the fact that several pulsars now occupy a region of the parameter space delimited by the\nspin period, orbital period, magnetic field and companion mass that seems inaccessible to the standard evolutionary channels. PSRs J1744\u22123922, J1232\u22126501,\nB1718\u221219 and B1831\u221200 are certainly the most noticeable candidates. Although other papers also identified that some of these pulsars have strange characteristics (see, e.g., van den Heuvel & Bitzaraki 1995;\nSutantyo & Li 2000; Edwards & Bailes 2001), there is no\nconsensus on their evolutionary histories. For instance\nthe case of PSR B1718\u221219 was considered somewhat\nunique because it is in a globular cluster and hence has\npossibly been partly perturbed, or even greatly changed,\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\nby stellar interactions (Ergma et al. 1996). The discovery of PSR J1744\u22123922, in the Galactic field, is important because it strengthens the possible connection between PSR B1718\u221219 and other similar binary pulsars in\nthe field. Unless they do not have WD companions, these\npulsars were at least partially recycled because tidal circularization is needed to explain eccentricities of 0.01\nand smaller. However some of them have eccentricities\n10\u22123 \u221210\u22122 , relatively large given their very short orbital\nperiods, which is in contrast to tight case A systems having smaller eccentricity (Phinney 1992). In this section\nwe speculate and put constraints on some scenarios that\nmay explain this possible new class of pulsars.\n5.1. Recycled High Magnetic Field Pulsar Channel\n\nOne possibility is that pulsars like PSR J1744\u22123922\nmay initially have had a magnetar-strength magnetic\nfield (B \u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 G). Such a pulsar could experience standard case A evolution involving conservative\nRLO but since the initial magnetic field is higher by 1\u20132\norders of magnitude, at the end of the recycling process,\nthe field might be 1010\u221211 G instead, consistent with observations. Since the recycling mechanism appears to\nstrongly correlate the final magnetic field with the final\nspin period, the pulsar would also have an unusually long\nspin period as well.\nWhether this extrapolation to magnetars and high\nmagnetic field pulsars is valid depends on accretioninduced decay models of the magnetic field strength.\nAmong the proposed mechanisms is magnetic field burial,\nin which material accretes through the polar cap and,\nwhile piling up at the poles, exerts a latitudinal pressure\ngradient by trying to spread toward the equator. This\neffect tends to drag the field lines away from the poles,\nincreasing the polar cap radius and decreasing the magnetic moment of the pulsar. Payne & Melatos (2004)\nshow that the magnetic field would naturally \"freeze\" to\na minimum stable strength once the amount of accreted\nmass exceeds some critical value, if the magnetospheric\nradius is comparable to the size of the neutron star. According to Payne (2005), this critical mass could reach\nup to 1 M\u2299 for a 1015 G NS and hence magnetic field\nsuppression would be difficult to achieve due to the large\namount of accretion mass required. However, accounting for other effects like the natural decay of magnetic\nfield due to X-ray emission and high-energy bursts (see\nWoods & Thompson 2006, for a review), might make a\npartially suppressed final magnetic field of 1010 G plausible.\nA recycled high magnetic field pulsar is expected to\nleave a He WD companion and follow the companion\nmass-orbital period relationship as for the normal case\nA systems. PSR B1718\u221219 is excluded from this kind of\nevolution because its companion is a bloated MS star. All\nthe other pulsars listed in Table 5 are potential members,\nalbeit PSRs B1800\u221227 and J0407+1607 would need relatively face-on orbits (i < 30 and 24\u25e6 , implying 13 and 9%\nprobability for randomly oriented orbits, respectively) to\nmatch the Porb \u2212 Mc relationship (Fig. 7). Another interesting prediction of this scenario is that, because the\nrecycling process can leave pulsars with relatively long\nspin periods, they might not be very different from the\nspin periods when accretion ceased. Thus, the real age\n\n7\n\ncould be much lower than the timing-based characteristic age, and the WD companions would have younger\ncooling ages as well.\nThe fraction of Galactic field binary pulsars in this\nclass (\u223c7/60) might naively be thought to be similar to\nthe fraction of observed magnetars with respect to the ordinary pulsars (\u223c10/1500). However, the observed population of magnetars suffers from severe selection effects\nbecause many of them appear to lie dormant, becoming\nobservable for only brief intervals, like XTE J1810\u2212197\n(Ibrahim et al. 2004). Therefore, we can relate these parameters as follows:\nNobs. mag. 1\nNclass\n,\n=\nNbinary\nNradio fquies\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Nclass is the number of pulsars in the new\nclass, Nbinary is the number of binary pulsar systems,\nNobs. mag. is the number of observed magnetars, Nradio\nis the number of radio pulsars and fquies the fraction of\nmagnetars in quiescence.\nHence we estimate that, due to quiescence, the fraction of observed magnetars with respect to the total\n7\n10\n/ 60\n\u223c 0.06. This would make\npopulation is about 1500\na total population of \u223c 175 magnetars which is consistent with the possible \u223c 100 in our Galaxy estimated\nby Woods & Thompson (2006), who used fquies = 0.1.\nOur crude calculation has many caveats: Is the binary\nmagnetar population similar to the binary radio pulsar\npopulation? Can the short lifetime of magnetars and\nhigh magnetic field neutron stars limit the number of\nsuch recycled systems? Clearly, this latter point depends\nstrongly on the time evolution of the self-induced decay\nof the magnetic field, which seems to operate on a time\nscale of a few tens of thousands of years (Kaspi 2004).\n5.2. UCXB Evolutionary Track Channel\n\nThere exists a class of neutron stars and CO/ONeMg\nWDs that accrete from light He WD donors in ultra\ntight (few tens of minutes) orbits. These X-ray emitters, known as ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs),\nmay be the result of wider \u223c 0.5-day systems that have\ndecayed due to gravitational wave radiation. A CE scenario has been proposed as a viable channel for forming\nCO/ONeMg WD \u2013 He WD and NS \u2013 He WD systems\n(Belczynski & Taam 2004). In fact such a channel would\nbe very similar to the case B scenario but for an initially\nmuch lighter companion. For companions not massive\nenough to experience the He flash, a CE phase is possible if the onset of mass transfer occurs late enough in the\nevolution so that the companion has reached the asymptotic giant branch. In this case, the RLO becomes unstable and it bifurcates from the standard case A track\nto the CE phase.\nPulsars experiencing this evolution would be partially\nrecycled, like case B systems, but they would have He\nWD companions. After this stage, only sufficiently tight\nsystems with orbital periods of about one hour or less\ncan evolve to become UCXBs within a Hubble time because gravitational decay is negligible for wider orbits. If\nPSR J1744\u22123922-like pulsars belong to the long orbital\nseparation high-end of the UCXB formation channel, we\nmight expect to see more such pulsars at similar and\nsmaller orbital separations than PSR J1744\u22123922. It is\n\n\f8\n\nBreton et al.\n\npossible, however, that the observed sample is biased:\nas the orbital separation decreases, wind and mass loss\nby the companion become more important and would\nmake them more difficult to detect in classical pulsar surveys conducted at low frequency (i.e. \u223c400 MHz) where\neclipses are more frequent and radio emission might simply turn off. The ongoing ALFA survey at Arecibo, at\n1400 MHz (Cordes et al. 2006), could therefore find several new pulsars like PSR J1744\u22123922. Additionally,\nlarger orbital accelerations make them more difficult to\nfind and, since gravitational wave radiation varies as the\nfourth power of the orbital separation, their lifetimes are\ndramatically shorter.\nIn such a scenario, these pulsars might be born at\na spin period that is comparable with those of case\nB pulsars having CO WD companions, assuming that\nthe short, high-accretion rate recycling would efficiently\nscreen the magnetic field during the mass transfer process. Afterwards, because of their relatively larger magnetic field, they would spin down more rapidly than case\nB pulsars. Thus, they would necessarily have longer spin\nperiods and the true age is more likely to be in agreement\nwith the measured characteristic age.\n5.3. AIC Channel\n\nFinally, a third scenario to explain the unusual properties of PSR J1744\u22123922 is the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive ONeMg WD into a NS. Most\nlikely AIC progenitors would be massive ONeMg WDs\n(& 1.15 M\u2299 ) accreting from MS donors in CV-like systems, or from red giants or He WDs in UCXB systems (see Taam 2004; Ivanova & Taam 2004, for more\ndetails). Nomoto & Kondo (1991) have shown that for\naccretion rates & 0.001 \u1e40Edd and/or metal-rich accreted\nmass, the ONeMg WD would collapse to a NS rather\nthan explode in a supernova. More recent calculations including Coulomb corrections to the equation of\nstate by Bravo & Garc\u0131\u0301a-Senz (1999) demonstrate that\nAIC is possible for critical densities of the accreting\nWD core that are 30% lower than previously found by\nNomoto & Kondo (1991), thus facilitating the formation\nof neutron stars through this channel.\nThe properties predicted by the AIC scenario nicely\nagree with what we observe for the class we are proposing: the mass transfer prior to the NS formation would\nexplain the low mass of the companion and the collapse\nis expected to be a quiet event during which almost no\nmass is lost in the system and only \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 is converted in binding energy into the NS. This would keep\nthe final orbital period close to what it was prior to the\ncollapse (which is small in most scenarios leading to AIC)\nand allow the eccentricity to be very small or, at least,\ncircularize rapidly. The survival rate of such systems\nis probably higher than for standard systems which are\nmore likely to be disrupted if a large amount of mass is\nlost during the supernova process. Although the initial\nproperties of pulsars formed by AIC are not known, we\nmay presume they resemble those of \"normal\" pulsars\nwith magnetic fields in the 1011\u221212 G range. Another interesting point to consider is that the AIC channel does\nnot require a degenerate companion. As opposed to the\nother two proposed scenarios (Sections 5.1 and 5.2), the\nformation of a pulsar through AIC can interrupt the mass\n\ntransfer, thus postponing further evolution. If the \"evolutionary quiescence\" is long enough, we would expect\nto find some non-degenerate companions around young\nAIC pulsars having circular orbits but with spin periods and magnetic fields that are more typical of isolated\npulsars. Finally, as the companion continues to evolve\nto fill its now larger Roche lobe, a shortened accretion\nphase might occur, thus transfering a very small amount\nof mass to the pulsar and leaving it partly recycled despite its low-mass companion.\nSome binary pulsars among the group we highlighted, like PSRs B1831\u221200 and B1718\u221219, have\nbeen proposed as AIC candidates in the past\n(van den Heuvel & Bitzaraki 1995; Ergma 1993). However, there is no firm evidence to support this. For instance, PSR B1718\u221219 is presumably a member of the\nglobular cluster NGC 6342. As Janssen & van Kerkwijk\n(2005) show, although observations suggest AIC is possible, an encounter and tidal capture scenario cannot be ruled out and is very reasonable given the\nplausible globular cluster association. On the other\nhand, PSR B1718\u221219 shares similarities with other\nbinary pulsars in the Galactic field, especially with\nPSR J1744\u22123922. PSR B1718\u221219's younger age, larger\nmagnetic field and spin period, as well as the fact that it\nhas a non-degenerate companion, are all compatible with\nit being an AIC pulsar in the intermediate \"quiescent\"\nphase.\nIn this context, the other pulsars of our putative\nclass would have reached the final evolutionary stage\nand, hence, display mildly recycled properties. If so,\nPSR J1744\u22123922 likely has a very light He WD companion. This might explain the lack of traditional eclipses\nas in PSR B1718\u221219 (Lyne et al. 1993), large DM variations as in NGC 6397A (D'Amico et al. 2001), and orbital period derivatives as in other compact binary pulsars (Nice, Arzoumanian & Thorsett 2000) since tidal effects are important for non-degenerate companions. If\nthe residual recycling phase left PSR J1744\u22123922 with\na long spin period, the cooling age of its hypothetical\nWD companion could be smaller than the characteristic age of the pulsar for the same reason described in\nthe recycled high magnetic field pulsar scenario (see Section 5.1). Also, pulsars forming through AIC can have\nlower masses than those made in standard supernovae\nand since they only accrete a small amount of mass from\ntheir companion afterwards, they might be less massive\nthan conventionally formed MSPs.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper highlights the unusual nature of the binary pulsar system PSR J1744\u22123922. The puzzling radio flux modulation that it exhibits does not show typical\nnulling properties as displayed by some old isolated pulsars; specifically, we have found strong evidence that its\nvariation is highly frequency dependent. Although our\norbital modulation analysis does not show a significant\ncorrelation between orbital phase and flux, the modulation could still be caused by a process related to a wind\nfrom its companion, which results in short time scale\nvariations grouped in extreme modulation \"events\". Additional monitoring of both the pulsar and of its companion may prove useful in this regard.\nWe pointed out that this pulsar has an unusual combi-\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\nnation of characteristics: long spin period, very low-mass\ncompanion, high magnetic field and short orbital period,\nthat are unexplained by standard binary pulsar evolution scenarios. We propose that PSR J1744\u22123922, along\nwith a several other binary pulsar systems, are part of a\nnew class of low-mass binary pulsars which failed to be\nfully recyled. Specifically, we suggest three alternative\nscenarios for this class of binary pulsars. Distinguishing\namong them may be possible by improving our knowledge of the nature of their companions. We also reported\nthe detection of a possible near-infrared counterpart to\nPSR J1744\u22123922's companion, however, determining its\nnature will require detailed near-infrared/optical followup.\nR.P.B. would like to thank Carl Bignell for his help\nwith the GBT observations.

The grayscale represents the intensity\nof the signal, with darker regions being brighter.

Each data point represents 60 sec of data\nand orbital phases are defined so that 0.25 is when the companion is in front of the pulsar. Panel A, B and C are the two 1400 MHz\nobservations and the 1950 MHz observation, respectively, displayed in Figure 1. We note that the flux drops below the detection limit at\n1400 MHz several times whereas it appears to be always above this threshold at 1950 MHz. Also, as illustrated in Figure 3, the variability\nis much stronger at lower frenquency.\n\n\f14\n\nBreton et al.\n\nFig. 3.- Distribution of the measured pulsed flux density values at 1400 MHz (solid line) and at 1950 MHz (dashed line). The 3\u03c3\nsensitivity threshold is \u223c 0.02 and 0.01 mJy at 1400 and 1950 MHz, respectively. We observe that PSR J1744\u22123922 rarely disappears at\n1950 MHz whereas there is a significant number of non-detections, centered about zero, at 1400 MHz (negative values are reported when\nthe pulsed flux density is below the telescope sensitivity, meaning the flux determination algorithm has fit noise). Also, we note that the\npulsed flux density is more variable and spans over higher values at 1400 MHz than at 1950 MHz.\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\n\n15\n\nFig. 4.- Ratio of pulses detected with respect to the total number observed at different orbital phases for the 1400 MHz Parkes and GBT\ncombined (panel A) and a similar plot showing the average pulsed flux intensity (panel B) for the Parkes 1400 MHz data (solid line) and\nthe GBT 1950 MHz data (red dashed line). Orbital phases are defined so that 0.25 is the pulsar's superior conjunction (i.e. the companion\npasses in front of the pulsar). The scale of the error bars represents the estimated errors without scaling from the results of the Monte\nCarlo simulations, hence they are likely underestimated.\n\n\f16\n\nBreton et al.\n\nFig. 5.- Near-infrared image of the field of PSR J1744\u22123922 in the K\u2032 band, obtained with AOB KIR at CFHT.

(1999) and our atmosphere models (see\nBergeron et al. 1995, 2001; Bergeron 2001, for more details).

The shaded region is the restricted range of absolute K\u2032 band magnitude inferred from\nthe CFHT data, and the dotted vertical line indicates the characteristic age of PSR J1744\u22123922.\n\n\fThe Unusual Binary Pulsar PSR J1744\u22123922\n\n17\n\nFig. 7.- Orbital period versus companion mass for binary pulsars in the Galactic field in circular orbits (e < 0.01). Symbols indicate the\ncompanion median mass (corresponding to i = 60\u25e6 ) and are coded according to the minimum mass: Mc \u2264 0.2 M\u2299 , 0.2 M\u2299 < Mc \u2264 0.35 M\u2299\nand Mc > 0.35 M\u2299 are black triangles, blue stars and red circles, respectively. Error bars cover the 90 %-probability mass range for randomly\noriented orbits having i = 90\u25e6 to i = 26\u25e6 . The curves are the predicted Porb \u2212 Mc relationships for different metallicity progenitors (from\nTauris & Savonije 1999). PSR J1744\u22123922 is identified by a square outline and pulsars listed in Table 5 with triangle outlines. The plot\nalso includes the globular cluster pulsar PSR B1718\u221219 (marked by a circle outline) because it resembles PSR J1744\u22123922 (see Section\n2.4).

PSR J1744\u22123922 is\nidentified by a square outline and pulsars listed in Table 5 with triangle outlines. The shaded area is the approximate region where is the\nproposed class of binary pulsars similar to PSR J1744\u22123922. The plots also include the globular cluster pulsar PSR B1718\u221219 (marked\nby a circle outline) because it resembles PSR J1744\u22123922 (see Section 2.4). The dashed line is the best-fit for a power-law, B \u221d P \u03b1 , with\n\u03b1 = 1.13. We excluded PSR B1718\u221219 from the fit as it is in a globular cluster.
