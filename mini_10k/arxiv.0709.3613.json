For the Kronecker quiver, Zwara [7, Theorem 1] has found an example of a representation whose orbit closure is neither unibranch nor Cohen-Macaulay. In this note, we explain\nhow to extend this example to all infinite type quivers without oriented cycles.\n\nIn this short note, we use quiver exceptional sequences to reduce, in a \"hom-controlled\" manner,\ne 2 . This observation\nthe list of all representation-infinite quivers without oriented cycles to just A\ncombined with Zwara's example from [7, Theorem 1] yields:\nTheorem 0.1. Let Q be a representation-infinite, connected quiver without oriented cycles. Then,\nthere exists a representation W whose orbit closure is neither unibranch nor Cohen-Macaulay.\nIn [6], Zwara showed that the orbit closures of representations of Dynkin quivers are always\nunibranch. Hence, we deduce that the Dynkin quivers are precisely the ones with the property\nthat all orbit closures are unibranch.\nIn what follows, we first review some background material from quiver theory and then prove\nTheorem 0.1. Throughout this note, we work over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic\nzero.\nLet Q = (Q0 , Q1 , t, h) be a finite quiver, where Q0 is the set of vertices, Q1 is the set of\narrows and t, h : Q1 \u2192 Q0 assign to each arrow a \u2208 Q1 its tail ta and head ha, respectively. A\nrepresentation V of Q over k is a family of finite dimensional k-vector spaces {V (x) | x \u2208 Q0 }\ntogether with a family {V (a) : V (ta) \u2192 V (ha) | a \u2208 Q1 } of k-linear maps. If V is a representation\nof Q, we define its dimension vector dV by dV (x) = dimk V (x) for every x \u2208 Q0 . Thus the\ndimension vectors of representations of Q lie in \u0393 = ZQ0 , the set of all integer-valued functions\non Q0 .\nGiven two representations V and W of Q, we define a morphism \u03c6 : V \u2192 W to be a collection\nof linear maps {\u03c6(x) : V (x) \u2192 W (x) | x \u2208 Q0 } such that for every arrow a \u2208 Q1 , we have\n\u03c6(ha)V (a) = W (a)\u03c6(ta). We denote by HomQ (V, W ) the k-vector space of all morphisms from\nV to W . Let W and V be two representations of Q. We say that V is a subrepresentation of\nW if V (x) is a subspace of W (x) for all vertices x \u2208 Q0 and V (a) is the restriction of W (a) to\nV (ta) for all arrows a \u2208 Q1 . In this way, we obtain the abelian category Rep(Q) of all quiver\nrepresentations of Q.\nA representation W is said to be a Schur representation if EndQ (W ) \u223c\n= C. The dimension\nvector of a Schur representation is called a Schur root.\nFrom now on, we assume that our quivers are without oriented cycles. For two\nquiver representations V and W , consider Ringel's canonical exact sequence [5] :\nM\nM\ndV\nW\nHomk (V (ta), W (ha)),\nHomk (V (x), W (x))\u2212\u2192\n(1)\n0 \u2192 HomQ (V, W ) \u2192\na\u2208Q1\n\nx\u2208Q0\n\nDate: August 24, 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Note\nthat if \u03b2 is a real Schur root then there exists a unique, up to isomorphism, exceptional \u03b2dimensional representation.\nFor \u03b1 and \u03b2 two dimension vectors, consider the generic ext and hom:\nextQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) := min{dimk Ext1Q (V, W ) | (V, W ) \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2)},\nand\nhomQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) := min{dimk HomQ (V, W ) | (V, W ) \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b1) \u00d7 Rep(Q, \u03b2)}.\nGiven two dimension vectors \u03b1 and \u03b2, we write \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03b2 provided that extQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = homQ (\u03b1, \u03b2) = 0.\nDefinition 0.2. We say that (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) is an exceptional sequence if\n(1) the \u03b5i are real Schur roots;\n(2) \u03b5i \u22a5 \u03b5j for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l.\nFollowing [4], a sequence (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) is called a quiver exceptional sequence if it is exceptional\nand h\u03b5j , \u03b5i i \u2264 0 for all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 l.\nNow, let \u03b5 = (\u03b51 , . . . , \u03b5r ) be a quiver exceptional sequence and let Ei \u2208 Rep(Q, \u03b5i ) be exceptional\nrepresentations. Construct a new quiver Q(\u03b5) with vertex set {1, . . . , r} and \u2212h\u03b5j , \u03b5i i arrows from\nj to i. Define C(\u03b5) to be the smallest full subcategory of Rep(Q) which contains E1 , . . . , Er and\nis closed under extensions, kernels of epimorphisms, and cokernels of monomorphisms.\nFor the remaining of this section, we assume that r \u2264 N \u2212 1, where N is the number of vertices\nof Q. We recall a very useful result from [4, Section 2.7] in a form that is convenient for us (see\nalso [3]):\nProposition 0.3. [4] The category C(\u03b5) is naturally equivalent to Rep(Q(\u03b5)) with E1 , . . . , Er\nbeing the simple objects of C(\u03b5). Furthermore, the inverse functor from Rep(Q(\u03b5)) to C(\u03b5) is a\nfull exact embedding into Rep(Q).\nConsider the linear transformation\nI : ZQ(\u03b5)0 \u2192 ZQ0\n\u03b1 = (\u03b1(1), . . . , \u03b1(r)) \u2192\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03b1(i)\u03b5i ,\n\ni=1\n\nIf F : Rep(Q(\u03b5)) \u2192 Rep(Q) is the full exact embedding form Proposition 0.4 then F is clearly\nhom-controlled in the sense of Zwara [8]. Let\nF (\u03b1) : Rep(Q(\u03b5), \u03b1) \u2192 Rep(Q, I(\u03b1))\nbe the induced morphism of varieties. Zwara [8, Theorem 2] (see also [2, Proposition 9]) showed\nthat hom-controlled functors preserve the type of singularities of orbit closures. In particular, we\nhave:\n\n\f3\n\nProposition 0.4. Keep the same notations as above. Let V \u2208 Rep(Q(\u03b5), \u03b1). Then, GL(\u03b1)V is\nnormal (or unibranch or Cohen-Macaulay) if and only if GL(I(\u03b1))F (\u03b1) (V ) has the same property.\nNext, let us recall Zwara's example from [7]:\nTheorem 0.5. Let \u03b8(2) be the Kronecker quiver\n1\nLabel the arrows\nby a\uf8f6and b. Consider\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0\n1\nby V (a) = \uf8ed1 0 0\uf8f8 and V (b) = \uf8ed0\n0 1 0\n0\nMacaulay.\n\nthe\n0\n0\n0\n\n+32\n\nfollowing\nrepresentation V \u2208 Rep(\u03b8(2), (3, 3)) defined\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f8. Then, GL(\u03b1)V is neither unibranch nor Cohen1\n\nProof of Theorem 0.1. From [1, Lemma 2.1, pp. 253], we know that any finite, connected quiver\nQ of infinite representation type must contain a Euclidean quiver as a subquiver. Therefore, it is\nenough to prove the theorem for Euclidean quivers. Now, let Q be a Euclidean quiver and denote\nby \u03b4Q the isotropic Schur root of Q.\nChoose v to be a vertex such that Q \\ v is a Dynkin quiver. Without loss of generality, let us\nassume that v is a source. In this case, we take \u03b51 = \u03b4Q \u2212 ev and \u03b52 = ev . Then, (\u03b51 , \u03b52 ) is a\nquiver exceptional sequence with h\u03b52 , \u03b51 i = \u22122 and so the proof follows from Proposition 0.4 and\nTheorem 0.5.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] Ibrahim Assem, Daniel Simson, and Andrzej Skowro\u0144ski.
