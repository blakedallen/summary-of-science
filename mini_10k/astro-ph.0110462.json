From the central 3.\u2032 2 \u00d7 3.\u2032 2 region, we detect 154 sources above the detection\nlimit of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221216 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 with a 100 ks-exposure. About 85% of the X-ray sources are\nidentified with an infrared counterpart, including four high mass stars in zero age main sequence\n(ZAMS) and/or pre main sequence (PMS) phase. The X-ray spectra of the high mass ZAMS and\nPMS stars are represented with a thin thermal plasma model of a temperature above \u223c 2 keV.\nThe X-rays are time-variable and exhibit rapid flares. These high temperature plasma and flaring\nactivity are similar to those seen in low mass PMS stars and contrary to the behavior observed\nin high mass main sequence stars. The X-ray luminosity increases as the intrinsic K-band flux\nincreases. However, the X-ray luminosity saturates at a level of \u223c 1031 ergs s\u22121 . We conclude\nthat high mass ZAMS and PMS emit X-rays, possibly due to the magnetic activity like those of\nlow mass stars.\nSubject headings: Stars: early-type - Stars: individual (Monoceros R2) - Stars: pre main sequence -\nX-rays: stars\n\n1.\n\nmerle et al. 1983). The X-rays become less active as low mass stars evolve to the main sequence\n(MS) stars.\nHigh mass MS stars lack the mechanism of magnetic field amplification, but they emit moderately\nvariable X-rays. The X-ray spectra are also due\nto a thin thermal plasma with the temperature\n(less than 1 keV) lower than those of low mass\nstars. The X-ray flux is approximately proportional to the bolometric luminosity, or strength of\nthe stellar wind (Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 1997). Thus the\nstellar wind may be involved in the origin of Xrays from high mass stars; it may be either the\nheated plasma by the shock induced in the stellar\nwind (Lucy & White 1980) or the wind collision\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nX-ray emission from normal stars are generally attributed to either magnetic activity, stellar\nwinds or both. Low mass young stellar objects\n(YSOs) emit X-rays with occasional flare activities. The X-ray spectra are described with a thin\nthermal plasma model of a temperature ranging\nfrom 1 to a few keV. These types of time variability and spectral shape are similar to those of\nthe solar X-rays but with much larger luminosity,\nwhich lead to the general consensus that the X-ray\norigin is due to the enhanced solar-type magnetic\nactivity; magnetic amplification and release of the\nfield energy (Feigelson & DeCampli 1981; Mont-\n\n1\n\n\fwith nearby stars (Pittard & Stevens 1997). It has\nalso been suggested that X-rays can be produced\nby the interaction of a stellar wind with a stable\n(i.e. dipolar like) magnetic field (e.g. Gagn\u00e9 et al.\n1997).\nX-ray observations of high mass YSOs are\nlargely behind those of low mass stars and high\nmass MS stars, because of less samples of this\nclass due to their quick evolution and less population than those of low mass stars. In fact, the\ndistance to the nearest star forming region (SFR)\nof high mass stars, the Orion Nebula is three times\nfurther than those of low mass SFRs. Since high\nmass YSOs generally reside in the dense cores\nof giant molecular clouds (GMCs), soft X-rays\nshould be strongly absorbed, hence hard X-ray\nimaging instruments are essentially required. The\nAdvanced Satellite of Cosmology and Astrophysics\n(ASCA) has found hard X-rays from the center of\nGMCs, the site of high mass star formation: the\nOrion region (Yamauchi et al. 1996), W3 (Hofner\n& Churchwell 1997), NGC6334 (Sekimoto et al.\n2000), and Monoceros R2 (Hamaguchi, Tsuboi, &\nKoyama 2000). However, the limited spatial resolution of \u223c 1\u2032 , did not allow us to uniquely resolve\nthe X-rays from high mass YSOs. Recently, Chandra X-ray Observatory observed the Orion Nebula\nand confirmed hard X-rays from high mass stars,\nthe trapezium stars and \"Source n\" in the early\nMS phase (Schulz et al. 2001; Garmire et al. 2000).\nThe Monoceros R2 cloud (here, Mon R2) is\na SFR at a distance of 830 pc (Racine et al.\n1968). The central region has a shell-like complex\n(IR shell) of sub-mm and far infrared dust cores\n(IRS 1\u20133) with K-band stars (Aspin & Walther\n1990; Henning, Chini, & Pfau 1992). The core\nmasses are 30\u2013150 M\u2299 , which are one order of\nmagnitude larger than those of protostellar cores\nof low and medium mass star forming regions.\nThus the cloud cores (IRS 1\u20133) are good candidates for high mass star formation.\nIRS 1 is resolved into two IR stars, IRS 1SW\nand 1NE (Howard, Pipher, & Forrest 1994).\nHoward et al. (1994) identified IRS 1NE with optical star \"B\" (Cohen & Frogel 1977). Since there\nis an emission peak in the radio and IR band and\nthe degree of polarization in the IR band is small\naround IRS 1 (Yao et al. 1997), the brighter source\nIRS 1SW of bolometric luminosity 3.0 \u00d7 103 L\u2299\n(Henning et al. 1992) is a B0 type star in zero\n\nage main sequence (ZAMS) and excites a compact\nH II region inside the IR shell (Massi, Felli, &\nSimon 1985).\nThe IR source aS is associated with a small IR\nnebulosity and has a similar IR spectrum to that\nof IRS 1SW (Carpenter et al. 1997), hence would\nbe the same class, a high mass star of early B type.\nSince aS has no H II region, it would be younger\nthan the ZAMS star IRS 1SW.\nIRS 2 is an illuminating source of the IR shell.\nThe infrared spectrum of IRS 2 (and also IRS 3,\nsee the next paragraph) shows deep absorption in\nthe water-ice band (Smith, Sellgren, & Tokunaga\n1989), and the spectropolarimetry of IRS 2 shows\nan excess polarization across the ice band (Yao\net al. 1997), which is the signature of a cluster of\nseveral young embedded sources including BN-like\nobjects (Hough et al. 1996), indicating that it is\nyounger than the ZAMS star IRS 1SW. However,\nno evidence for a molecular outflow from IRS 2\nhave been reported. The bolometric luminosity of\nIRS 2 is 6.5 \u00d7 103 L\u2299 (Henning et al. 1992).\nIRS 3, the brightest near- and mid-IR source\nin the Mon R2, has a bolometric luminosity of\n1.3 \u00d7 104 L\u2299 , and is another active star forming\nsite (Henning et al. 1992). The presence of H2 O\nand OH masers (Smits, Cohen, & Hutawarakorn\n1998) and a compact molecular outflow indicate\nthat IRS 3 is still in a phase of dynamical mass\naccretion (Giannakopoulou et al. 1997). IRS 3 has\nbeen resolved into two sources, IRS 3NE and SW\n(Carpenter et al. 1997).\nIRS 1, aS , IRS 2 and 3, thus comprise nice samples for the evolution of high mass stars from pre\nmain sequence (PMS) to ZAMS. We therefore performed a deep Chandra observation of Mon R2.\nThis paper reports the results and discusses the\nX-ray evolution in the early phase of high mass\nstars.\n2.\n\nOBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nWe observed the Mon R2 dark cloud on December 2\u20134, 2000 with the Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometers (ACIS) onboard the Chandra Xray Observatory (Weisskopf et al. 2000). We used\nthe ACIS-I array consisting of four abutted X-ray\nCCDs, which covers a full region of Mon R2 and\nsurroundings. Using the Level 2 processed events\n2\n\n\fprovided by the pipeline processing at the Chandra X-ray Center, we selected the ASCA grades1\n0, 2, 3, 4 and 6, as X-ray events; the other events,\nwhich are due to charged particles, hot and flickering pixels, are removed. The effective exposure\nis then about 100 ks.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nof the X-ray sources have an IR counterpart. Inversely, 260 or about 2/3 of the IR sources in the\ncatalogue (Carpenter et al. 1997) emit no significant X-rays.\n3.2.\n\nK vs. H\u2212K magnitude relation\n\nFigure 2 shows the K vs. H \u2212 K magnitude\nrelation for the X-ray detected (open circles) and\nnon-detected (filled circles) sources using the IR\ndata of Carpenter et al. (1997). In general, the Xray detected sources have more luminous K-band\nflux than those of non-X-ray sources. To estimate approximate stellar mass, we show a model\ntrack of 2.5 M\u2299 stars in the age from 0.07 Myr to\n2 Myr (solid line; D'Antona & Mazzitelli 1994).\nThe extinction effect for 2.5 M\u2299 stars with ages\nof 0.07 Myr and 2 Myr are given by dashed lines.\nFrom Figure 2, we find that 6 IR stars are well\nabove the 2.5 M\u2299 line of any ages, hence these\nwould be the highest mass stars in the cloud.\nSince IRS 1SW has been identified to be a B0 star\n(15 M\u2299 ) in ZAMS (Aspin & Walther 1990), the\nother 5 sources would have nearly equal or even\nhigher mass than 15 M\u2299 . Among the six high\nmass YSOs, four (IRS 1SW, IRS 2, IRS 3NE and\naS ) are found to emit X-rays.\n\nANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nSource Detection and Identification\n\nThe ACIS X-ray image of a 3.\u2032 2 \u00d7 3.\u2032 2 region at\nMon R2 is given in Figure 1 with the blue and red\ncolors representing the hard (2.0\u201310.0 keV) and\nsoft (0.5\u20132.0 keV) bands, respectively. The CS\nJ = 5 \u2192 4 line intensity map (Choi et al. 2000)\nis overlaid on the X-ray image. To search for Xray sources in the region, we perform wavdetect2\nin the total (0.5\u201310.0 keV), hard (2.0\u201310.0 keV)\nand soft (0.5\u20132.0 keV) band images. We find 142\nsources with a significance criterion at 10\u22126 and\nthe wavelet scales ranging between 1 and 16 pixels.\nIn addition, we manually inspect the image and\nfind 12 sources above 5 \u03c3 confidence level. The\nmean position error is 0.\u2032\u2032 15. X-ray events from\neach detected source are extracted within a radius of 2.\u2032\u2032 5, which is about 5 times the FWHM\nof the point spread function at the on-axis position. These circles include about 90 % of the total photons from the relevant sources, but include\nless than one background event, hence we do not\nsubtract the background. In crowded regions, we\nextract events within a radius of 1.\u2032\u2032 5 to avoid contamination.\nWe search for a near-infrared counterpart from\nthe deep imaging in the J, H, K and nbL' band by\nCarpenter et al. (1997), using IRCAM3 at UKIRT.\nIn their measurement, the typical uncertainty is\nabout 0.05 mag for all these bands. Since the\nX-ray positions are systematically offset to the\nnortheast, we correct the X-ray positions by shifting 1.\u2032\u2032 50 to the west and 0.\u2032\u2032 76 to the south. After adjusting the X-ray positions, the offset between the X-ray source and its IR counterpart becomes \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 33 (r.m.s.). We find that 130 X-ray\nsources have an IR counterpart within 1\u2032\u2032 (3\u03c3).\nThe source positions, counts and infrared counterparts are given in Table 1. Thus about 85 %\n\n3.3.\n\nTime Variability and X-ray Spectra\n\nWe make light curves for all the X-ray sources,\nthen the time variability is examined with the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test (Press et al. 1992) for\nconstant flux hypotheses using lcstats in the\nXRONOS (Ver 5.16) package3. The significance\nlevel of the time variability is listed in Table 1.\nAbout a half of the sources exhibit time variability with 90 % confidence level. As for the four\nhigh mass stars, three show time variability with\nthe 98 % confidence level.\nFor brighter sources with more than 20 counts,\nwe fit the spectrum with a thin thermal plasma\nmodel (Mewe, Gronenschild, & van den Oord\n1985) using XSPEC (Ver. 11.0)4 . Since statistics\nare still limited, we fix the abundances to be 0.3\nsolar, according to the previous reports (Kamata\net al 1997., Yamauchi et al. 1996). The bestfit parameters are listed in Table 1. This simple\n\n1 see\n\nhttp://asc.harvard.edu/udocs/docs/POG/MPOG/index.html\n2 see http://asc.harvard.edu/udocs/docs/swdocs/detect/html/\n\n3\n\n3 see\n4 see\n\nhttp://xronos.gsfc.nasa.gov\nhttp://xspec.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n\fmodel is acceptable for most of the sources. The\nerrors are 90 % confidence limit for the relevant\none parameter (in the range of the \u03c72 minimum +\n2.7). The mean temperature is 3 keV and about a\nhalf of the best-fit temperatures fall between 2 keV\nand 5 keV. The absorption column density scatters\nmore largely from 1021 to 1023 cm\u22122 .\nFor the fainter sources, we fit the spectrum with\na fixed-temperature of 3 keV (the averaged temperature of the brighter sources), and the best-fit\nluminosity and column density are listed in Table\n1. These values change typically \u00b150% and \u00b130%,\nallowing the temperature to 2 keV and 5 keV, respectively.\n3.4.\n\nvalues (see the next section). One possibility is\nthat the spectrum is contaminated by other unknown sources. In Figure 3, we find a faint diffuse or multiple sources near IRS 3NE. We thus\nre-fit the spectrum with a strongly absorbed high\ntemperature component plus a less absorbed low\ntemperature component; the former is likely from\nIRS 3NE, and the latter would be another source\naround. For the spectral fitting, we assume the NH\nof IRS 3NE to be 7 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 using the relation\nof Figure 6 (see the next section). The best-fit\ntwo-temperature model is given in Figure 4d. The\nhigh temperature component (that from IRS 3NE)\nhas kT > 3.3 keV and the luminosity is estimated\nto be 1.6 \u00d7 1030 ergs s\u22121 . Note that the values in\nTable 1 are the results of one-component fit, hence\nare different from those of the two-component fit.\nSince the soft X-ray band of IRS 3NE is largely\ncontaminated by nearby sources, we make the Xray light curve in the hard (2\u201310 keV) band and\nis given in Figure 5d. Unlike the other high mass\nYSOs, the light curve shows no significant time\nvariability. However, the poor statistics can not\ngive strong constraint on the time variability.\n\nIndividual High Mass Sources\n\nTo study the X-ray properties of four high mass\nstars (IRS 1SW, IRS 2, IRS 3NE and aS ) in further\ndetail, we show a closed-up version of the X-ray\nimages of an area 50\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 50\u2032\u2032 (Figure 3). The X-ray\nspectrum of IRS 1SW (No. 79 in Table 1) is fitted\nwith a thin thermal plasma model as is shown in\nFigure 4a. The best-fit plasma temperature, absorption column density and X-ray luminosity are\n\u223c 2 keV, \u223c 5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , and 1031 ergs s\u22121 , respectively. The X-rays are time variable with a\nflare-like event as is shown in Figure 5a.\nThe X-ray spectrum and light curve of another\ncandidate of the high mass ZAMS star aS (No. 91)\nare given in Figure 4b and 5b, respectively. The\nX-ray spectrum is well fitted with a thin thermal\nplasma model (see Figure 4b) with the best-fit\nplasma temperature, absorption column and Xray luminosity of \u223c 2 keV, \u223c 5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , and\n6 \u00d7 1030 ergs s\u22121 , respectively. A flare-like event\nis also observed (see Figure 5b). These X-ray features are very similar to those of IRS 1SW.\nThe X-ray spectrum and light curve of IRS 2\n(No. 67) are shown in Figure 4c and 5c, respectively. The spectrum is fitted with a thin thermal\nplasma of 10.9 keV temperature and absorption\ncolumn of \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 (see Figure 4c). The Xray flux is highly variable with a slow-rise profile at\nthe peak luminosity of 2\u00d71031 ergs s\u22121 (see Figure\n5c).\nIn contrast to the other high mass YSO candidates, the spectrum of IRS 3NE (No. 116) shows\nno large absorption with the best-fit NH of 1.4 \u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 , which is inconsistent with the H \u2212 K\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nGlobal Features\n\nIn Figure 6, we plot the best-fit NH as a function of H \u2212K magnitude, where the bright sources\n(temperatures are free parameters) are given by\ncircles and those of faint (fixed temperature of\n3 keV) are shown by boxes. The best-fit relation\nfor the brighter sources with more than 60 counts\n(filled circles) is NH = [(2.04 \u00b1 0.26)(H \u2212 K) \u2212\n(0.64 \u00b1 0.26)] \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 .\nAlthough the intrinsic H \u2212 K value for the\nstars change with their ages and masses, we assume their intrinsic colors are the same. Then,\nfrom the relation between AV and infrared extinction (Cohen et al. 1981), we obtain a relation of NH = (1.32 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 1021 AV cm\u22122 ,\nsignificantly different from that in our Galaxy,\nNH = 1.79 \u00d7 1021 AV cm\u22122 (Predehl & Schmitt\n1995). This means that the dust-to-gas ratio in\nthis cloud is larger than the mean interstellar\nmedium. We also derived the average intrinsic\ncolor to be H0 \u2212 K0 \u223c 0.3.\nWe estimate extinction corrected K-magnitude\n(Kc) using the standard relation of AK =\n4\n\n\f1.38E(H \u2212 K) (Cohen et al. 1981). Figure 7\nis a scatter plot of LX vs. Kc, where the symbols\nare the same as in Figure 6. Although the conversion of Kc to the stellar mass is not unique, the\nsmaller Kc represents, as the first approximation,\nthe higher mass stars. From Figure 7, we find that\nLX seems to saturate at \u223c 1031 ergs s\u22121 in the\nhigh mass end.\n4.2.\n\nal. 2001). The relation between the X-ray luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of IRS 2 is\nalso comparable to the empirical relation for stellar wind origin of high mass MS stars (Bergh\u00f6fer\net al. 1997). Although possible source confusion\ncan not be excluded, ASCA found a big flare from\nthe position of IRS 2, with the peak luminosity of\n1033 ergs s\u22121 (Hamaguchi et al. 2000). Since the\ntime scale of X-ray variations from IRS 2 (Figure\n5c) is long enough to be caused by rotational modulation, it may be conceivable that X-rays arise\nfrom the interaction of stellar wind with magnetosphere (e.g. Gagn\u00e9 et al. 1997). However, IRS 2\nhas no H II region, hence no strong UV field, nor\nstrong stellar wind. Therefore, the more likely scenario is that X-rays from IRS 2 are due to a solarlike magnetic reconnection.\nWe find heavily-absorbed hard X-rays from\nIRS 3NE in the outflow source IRS 3 complex\n(NE and SW). The X-ray luminosity has a relation of LX \u223c 10\u22128 \u00d7 Lbol , significantly smaller\nthan the other stars. Since there are no reliable\nK-band photometry data of IRS 3NE and SW at\npresent, we estimate their K-band magnitude from\nthe 2MASS data5 , assuming they have the same\nK-band magnitude. Then IR extinction is very\nlarge in the range of H \u2212 K = 3 \u2212 4 mag. The outflows found from IRS 3 would be derived by magnetic fields, and the infrared polarimetry revealed\nthat the interstellar magnetic field is compressed\nfrom the neighbor of the GMCs (e.g. Yao et al.\n1997), therefore the X-rays due to the magnetic\nreconnection between the accretion disk and the\nstar surface are conceivable (Hayashi, Shibata, &\nMatsumoto 1996). To confirm this scenario, a flare\ndetection is essential. Although we find a hint of\nrapid flares in Figure 5d, these are not statistically\nsignificant.\nWe have suggested that the high mass PMS\nhave magnetically driven activity similar to that\nseen in low mass PMS stars. Much of this interpretation arises from the high plasma temperatures and flare-like behavior of the X-ray time series (Figure 5). Since the majority of stars in the\nuniverse seem to form binary pairs, one may argue\nthat these high mass YSOs are binaries with low\nmass companions, and the low mass YSOs may be\nthe origin of the X-ray flares and, in some cases,\n\nHigh Mass YSOs\n\nWe discover heavily absorbed X-rays from high\nmass YSOs (ZAMS and PMS), IRS 1SW, IRS 2,\nIRS 3NE and aS , but no X-rays from IRS 3SW\nand IRS 5. Garmire et al. (2000) reported the\ndetection of X-rays from \"Source n\" in the Orion\nNebula. The IR luminosity is comparable to our\npredicted value of high mass stars in Mon R2.\nSince \"Source n\" is known to have an H II region\n(Gezari, Backman, & Werner 1998), it would be already a MS star, possibly ZAMS. The other X-ray\nemitting high mass stars (Schulz et al. 2001), the\nOrion Trapezium, are also well in the MS phase.\nTherefore our observation of Mon R2 provides the\nfirst reliable detection of X-rays from high mass\nYSOs in the cloud cores.\nIRS 1SW and aS are strong and heavily absorbed X-ray sources, consistent with their H \u2212 K\nvalues (see Figure 2). The high temperature\nplasma of \u223c 2 keV, large absorption and rapid\ntime variability, in particular flares, are typical of\nthe embedded low mass stars, which show magnetic activity (e.g. Imanishi et al. 2001). In fact,\nX-rays from high mass MS stars, originated in\nthe stellar wind activity, exhibit lower temperature plasma of \u223c1 keV and relatively stable light\ncurve (Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 1997). The X-ray luminosities are comparable to the empirical relation\nof LX \u223c 10\u22126 \u201310\u22127 \u00d7 Lbol found for stellar wind\norigin of high mass MS stars (Bergh\u00f6fer et al.\n1997), but are significantly larger than those of\nlow mass YSOs (Feigelson et al. 1993; Casanova\net al. 1995). We thus suspect IRS 1SW and aS\npossibly in ZAMS (Aspin & Walther 1990), still\ndominate the magnetic activity over that of the\nstellar wind found in high mass MS stars.\nIRS 2 exhibits the highest plasma temperature\nand the largest absorption column density among\nthe bright sources in the Mon R2 cloud. These\nlarge values have been only found in the class I\nlow mass stars (Koyama et al. 1996; Imanishi et\n\n5 http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/releases/second/doc/explsup.html\n\n5\n\n\fthe entire X-ray flux. The X-ray luminosity of\nthese high mass YSOs, \u223c 1030\u221231 ergs s\u22121 , are\nhowever significantly larger than those of typical\nlow mass YSOs of \u223c 1028\u221229 ergs s\u22121 . Thus contribution of low mass companion, if any, may be\nsmall fraction of the bulk X-rays observed from\nthe high mass YSOs.\nThe high mass YSOs in Mon R2 can be compared to the Orion Trapezium stars, \u03b81 Ori A\u2013E.\nSince the Trapezium stars are producing luminous\nH II regions, they already entered the MS phase\nwith very strong stellar winds. Schulz et al. (2001)\nreported that three of the trapezium stars, C\n(O7V), E (B0.5) and A (B0V-B1V) exhibit X-rays\nwith the luminosities of about 2 \u00d7 1032 ergs s\u22121 ,\n4 \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 , and 2 \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 , respectively. They also show a high temperature component of about 2 keV in addition to a lower temperature component of about 1 keV. The luminosities and temperatures of the soft components\nare consistent with the stellar wind origin. For the\nhard components, however, the plasma temperature is higher than that predicted with the stellar\nwind velocity, hence would be attributable to a\nmagnetic origin, like the Mon R2 stars. Moreover,\nGagn\u00e9 et al. (1997) found X-ray variations from \u03b81\nOri C. This would be supporting evidence for remaining the magnetic activity on these high mass\nstars, although Gagn\u00e9 et al. (1997) interpreted\nit as the interaction of a magnetosphere and the\nstellar winds.\nThus we propose a working hypothesis for the\nstudy of X-ray evolution of young stars which\nwas proposed in the X-ray study of intermediate\nmass young stars Herbig Ae/Be stars (Hamaguchi\n2001), that, even high mass stars, produce variable\nand hard (2\u20133 keV) X-rays due to the magnetic\nactivity between the accretion disk and the stellar\nsurface in a PMS phase (IRS 2 and IRS 3NE). It\ncontinues until a ZAMS phase (IRS 1SW and aS ),\nthen gradually stellar wind activities come in (the\nTrapezium stars). The magnetic activity fades as\nthe accretion disk disappears. Finally most of high\nmass MS stars emit soft (1 keV) X-rays by the\nstrong stellar wind.\n\n& Cassinelli, J.P. 1997, A&A, 322, 167\nCarpenter, J.M., Meyer, M.R., Dougados, C.,\nStrom, S.E., & Hillenbrand L.A. 1997, AJ, 114,\n198\nCasanova, S., Montmerle, T., Feigelson, E.D., &\nAndr\u00e9, P. 1995, ApJ, 439, 752\nChoi, M., Evans II, N.J., Tafalla, M., & Bachiller,\nR. 2000, ApJ, 538, 738\nCohen, J.G., & Frogel, J.A. 1977, ApJ, 211, 178\nCohen, J.G., Frogel, J.A., Persson, S.E., & Elias,\nJ.H. 1981, ApJ, 249, 481\nD'Antona, F., & Mazzitelli, I. 1994, ApJS, 90, 467\nFeigelson, E.D., & DeCampli, W.M. 1981, ApJ,\n243, L89\nFeigelson, E.D., Casanova, S., Montmerle, T.,\nGuibert, J. 1993, ApJ, 416, 623\nGagn\u00e9, M., Caillault, J.P., Stauffer, J.R., & Linsky, J.L. 1997, ApJ, 478, L87\nGarmire, G., Feigelson, E.D., Broos, P., Hillenbrand, L.A., Pravdo, S.H., Townsley, L., &\nTsuboi, Y. 2000, AJ, 120, 1426\nGezari, D.Y., Backman, D.E., & Werner, M.W.\n1998, ApJ, 509, 283\nGiannakopoulou, J., Mitchell, G.F., Hasegawa,\nT.I., Matthews, H.E., & Maillard, J.P. 1997,\nApJ, 487, 346\nHamaguchi, K., Tsuboi, Y., & Koyama, K. 2000,\nAdv.
