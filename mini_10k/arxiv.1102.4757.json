According to theoretical\nmodels, the amount of energy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with the mass of the companion.

The\ncurrently known systems have very short periods \u2243 0.1\u22120.3 d. Here we report the discovery of a low mass companion (M2 > 0.14 M\u2299 )\norbiting the sdB star and central star of a planetary nebula EGB 5 with an orbital period of 16.5 d at a minimum separation of 23 R\u2299 .\nIts long period is only just consistent with the energy balance prescription of the common envelope.

Low mass stellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for the still unclear\nformation of hot subdwarf stars.

Introduction\nThe ESO SN Ia Progenitor Survey (SPY) was developed to identify double degenerate progenitor candidates to SN Ia. More than\n1000 white dwarfs (WDs) and pre-WDs were checked for radial\nvelocity (RV) variations using high resolution spectra obtained\nwith the UVES instrument at the ESO-VLT (e.g. Napiwotzki et\nal. 2003). Results for nine binaries discovered in the SPY survey\nwere presented in papers I-V (Napiwotzki et al. 2001, 2002; Karl\net al. 2003; Nelemans et al. 2005; Geier et al. 2010a).\nSubluminous B stars, which are also known as hot sudwarf\nstars, display the same spectral characteristics as main-sequence\nstars of spectral type B, but are much less luminous. They are assumed to be core helium-burning stars with very thin hydrogen\nenvelopes and masses around 0.5 M\u2299 (Heber 1986). The formation of these objects is still unclear. Different formation channels\nhave been discussed (see Han et al. 2002, 2003). It is found that\na large fraction of sdB stars are members of short period binaries (Maxted et. al 2001; Napiwotzki et al. 2004a). For these\nSend offprint requests to: S.

Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron\u00f3mico\nHispano Alem\u00e1n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the MaxPlanck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de\nAndaluc\u0131\u0301a (CSIC). Some of the data used in this work were obtained at\nthe William Herschel Telescope (WHT) operated by the Isaac Newton\nGroup of Telescopes (ING).\n\nsystems, common envelope (CE) ejection is the most probable\nformation channel (Paczy\u0144ski 1976). In this scenario, two mainsequence stars of different masses evolve in a binary system. The\nheavier one will reach the red giant phase first and fill its Roche\nlobe. If the mass transfer to the companion is dynamically unstable, a common envelope is formed. Owing to gravitational\ndrag, the two stellar cores lose orbital energy, which is deposited\nwithin the envelope and leads to a shortening of the binary period\n(e.g. Ricker & Taam 2008). Eventually the common envelope\nis ejected and a close binary system is formed, which contains\na core helium-burning sdB and a main-sequence companion. If\nthe second star reaches the red giant branch, another common\nenvelope phase is possible and can lead to a close binary with a\nwhite dwarf companion and an sdB.\nEGB 5 was discovered to be the blue central star of a faint\nelliptical planetary nebula (PN G 211.9+22.6) by Ellis et al.\n(1984). M\u00e9ndez et al. (1988a) derived the atmospheric parameters of this star by fitting model spectra. The resulting parameters\nT eff = 42 000 \u00b1 5000 K and log g = 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 were neither consistent with canonical post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB)\nevolutionary tracks nor the parameters of all other known central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN, Drilling & Sch\u00f6nberner\n1985). M\u00e9ndez et al. (1988a) recognized that these parameters\nare typical of a hot subdwarf star rather than a post-AGB object and speculated that this is a close binary that experienced\nnon-conservative mass exchange during the first giant phase.\nLisker et al. (2005) derived more accurate atmospheric parameters of EGB 5 from high resolution spectra obtained in\n1\n\n\fS. Geier et al.: Binaries discovered by the SPY survey\n\nFig. 1. Radial velocities of the subdwarf primary measured from\nspectra obtained with UVES (rectangles), ISIS (upward triangles), and TWIN (diamonds) plotted against orbital phase (P =\n16.537 d). The residuals are plotted below.\n\nFig. 2. In this power spectrum \u2212 log \u03c72 of the best sine fits is plotted against the orbital periods. The dotted horizontal line marks\nthe 1\u03c3 confidence limit, the dashed the 3\u03c3, and the solid line the\n6\u03c3 limit.\n\nthe course of the SPY survey, which are perfectly consistent\nwith a core helium-burning sdB star (T eff = 34 000 \u00b1 400 K,\nlog g = 5.85 \u00b1 0.05, log y = \u22122.77 \u00b1 0.04).\nOnly one CSPN candidate with similar parameters is known\nso far (PHL 932, M\u00e9ndez et al. 1988b; Napiwotzki 1999; Lisker\net al. 2005). Whether this star has a close companion remains\ndisputed, because several searches for RV variations yielded inconsistent results (Wade 2001; de Marco et al. 2004; Af\u015far &\nBond 2005). It is therefore unclear whether this star experienced\na common envelope phase. Furthermore, Frew et al. (2010) convincingly demonstrated that the nebula around PHL 932 is not a\nplanetary nebula, but rather a Str\u00f6mgren sphere.\nHere we report the discovery of a close companion to EGB 5.\n\na randomised set of RVs was drawn from Gaussian distributions\nwith central values and widths corresponding to the RV measurements and the analysis repeated. In 82% of the trials, the most\nlikely solution was fitted, the next best solution being chosen in\n12% of the iterations.\nSince the RV variation in EGB 5 is very small, we used\nFITSB2 to perform a simultaneous fit of Keplerian orbits to all\n169 lines in the 43 spectra covering different orbital phases, i.e.,\nall available information is combined into the parameter determination procedure. Motivated by the discovery of eccentric orbits in close sdB binaries (Edelmann et al. 2005; Napiwotzki\net al. in prep.), we did not restrict our fitting to circular orbits.\nThe best-fit orbital solution is shown in Table 2. The errors were\ndetermined by bootstrapping and the reduced \u03c72 of the best-fit\nsolution is 0.97. For comparison, a sine curve was fitted to the\nsingle RV points in the way described in Geier et al. (2010c), and\nour derived orbital parameters (P = 16.532 d, \u03b3 = 68.8 km s\u22121,\nK = 16.1 km s\u22121) are consistent with the results given in Table 2.\nWe are reluctant to claim orbital eccentricity in the case\nof EGB 5 despite the formal eccentricity being found to be\n0.098 \u00b1 0.048. An F-test indicates a borderline significance of\n87% compared to a circular solution. Systematic errors introduced by combining datasets taken with different instruments\ncan easily mimic small eccentricities. High-resolution, timeresolved spectroscopy with a better coverage of the whole orbit\nwould be necessary to solve this issue. Since the formal eccentricity is low, it does not significantly affect the derived minimum\ncompanion mass.\n\n2. Orbital parameters\nEGB 5 was observed twice in the course of the SPY project\nwith the high resolution echelle spectrograph UVES at the ESOVLT. Follow-up high resolution spectra were obtained with\nUVES, medium resolution spectra were taken with the ISIS\nspectrograph at the WHT, and the TWIN spectrograph mounted\nat CAHA 3.5m telescope. The RVs were measured by fitting\na set of mathematical functions (Gaussians, Lorentzians, and\npolynoms) to the hydrogen Balmer and helium lines using the\nFITSB2 routine (Napiwotzki et al. 2004b). Errors were calculated with a bootstrapping algorithm. The RV measurements are\ngiven in Table 1.\nTo determine the orbital parameters and estimate the significance of the solution, sine curves were fitted to 43 RV data points\nusing a \u03c72 -minimising method (SVD). The \u03c72 against orbital period is given in Fig. 2. Two peaks are present at P \u2243 16.53 d and\nP \u2243 25.39 d with the former one being the most probable solution. We performed Monte Carlo simulations (10 000 iterations)\nto estimate the significance of the solution. For each simulation,\n2\n\n3.

We choose ten times solar metallicity\nmodels to mimic strong UV line blanketing. This is motivated\nby the strong enrichment of heavy elements produced by radiative levitation in sdB stars with similar parameters (O'Toole &\nHeber 2006; Geier et al. 2007). The atmospheric parameters (see\nTable 2) are similar to the ones derived by Lisker et al. (2005).\n\n4. Nature of the unseen companion\nAdopting the canonical sdB mass of 0.47 M\u2299, the minimum\nmass of the unseen companion (0.14 M\u2299) is consistent with either a late main-sequence star of spectral type M or a low-mass\nwhite dwarf. Since no spectral features of the companion are\nvisible in the optical spectra, a main-sequence companion with\na mass higher than \u2243 0.45 M\u2299 can be excluded (Lisker et al.\n\n0.47 M\u2299\n0.13 R\u2299\n0.14 M\u2299\n23 R\u2299\n\n2005). A white dwarf companion of similar or more mass would\nrequire the binary inclination to be lower than 24\u25e6 . Assuming\nrandomly distributed inclinations, the probability for such a low\ninclination in the case of EGB 5 is less than 9%.\nOwing to its long orbital period it is rather unlikely that the\nsystem is eclipsing or that it shows other detectable features (e.g.\nreflection effects) in its light curve. It is therefore not possible\nto constrain the nature of the companion further. The low mass\nindicates that it is either a late M dwarf or a low mass WD with\na He core.\nFor the most likely companion mass range of 0.14\u22120.45 M\u2299,\nthe separation between sdB and companion is constrained to be\n23 \u2212 27 R\u2299. All relevant measurements and parameters of the\nEGB 5 system are summarized in Table 2.\n\n5. Discussion\nEGB 5 has the second longest period of all known sdBs in\nclose binary systems. Morales-Rueda et al. (2003) discovered\nthree binaries with periods near or exceeding 10 d and unseen\ncompanions (PG 0850+170, 27.815 d; PG 1619+522, 15.3578 d;\nPG 1110+294, 9.4152 d). In all these cases, the derived minimum companion masses exceed 0.45 M\u2299 consistent with WD\ncompanions. The low minimum companion mass of EGB 5 is\ntherefore rather unusual.\nClose binaries with sdB primaries and M dwarf companions\nhave been discovered by means of variations in their light curves\ncaused by light originating in the heated surface of the cool companion and often accompanied by eclipses (see e.g. For et al.\n2010; \u00d8stensen et al. 2010). The orbital periods of these binaries are very short (\u2243 0.1 \u2212 0.3 d), because these so-called reflection effects can only be detected in such cases. The longest\nperiod systems, where a reflection effect was detected, is the binary JL 82 (0.7371 d, Edelmann et al. 2005; Koen 2009; Geier et\nal. 2010b).\nWith an orbital period of 16.537 days, EGB 5 would have by\nfar the longest period of all sdB+dM binaries known. The Mdwarf companion must have been engulfed by the giant progenitor of the sdB star and the common envelope ejected. According\n3\n\n\fS. Geier et al.: Binaries discovered by the SPY survey\n\nto theoretical models, the change in orbital energy must be at\nleast as large as the binding energy of the giant (see Paczynski\n1976; Han et al. 2002, 2003). Detailed models of giants at the\ntip of the red-giant branch that will form sdB stars after the common envelope are given in Hu et al. (2007). For a 1 M\u2299 progenitor, even a low mass companion of 0.14 M\u2299 in principle could\neject the envelope, at least if the thermal energy of the envelope can be used. For more massive companions, the envelope\ncould even be ejected without the thermal energy. However, in\nany case it implies that the efficiency of the common envelope\n(\u03b1) is high. Assuming that the efficiency is a universal parameter, this means that the much closer HW Vir binaries should have\nformed from more massive sdB progenitors and thus should have\nlower masses (see Hu et al. 2007, Fig. 3) than EGB 5. In contrast, the masses of most sdB primaries in HW Vir systems constrained by observations seem to be close to the canonical value.\nHowever, we point out that reliable mass determinations in such\nsystems are still hampered by severe issues (see e.g. For et al.\n2010; \u00d8stensen et al. 2010). de Marco et al. (2011) suggested\nthat low mass companions may have higher common envelope\nefficiencies, possibly because of their longer in-spiral timescales.\nWhile close binary sdB+dM systems of HW Vir type are\neasy to find from their characteristic light curves, it is much\nharder to discover these systems in wider orbits and at lower inclination. Were the companion of EGB 5 to be an M dwarf, these\nsystems might be very common and that \u2243 10% of all known\nsdB binaries are of HW Vir type just a selection effect. Barlow\net al. (2010) found a sinusoidal variation in the O-C-diagram of\nthe pulsating sdB CS 1246, which is most likely caused by a low\nmass companion in a 14.1 d orbit very similar to EGB 5.\nThe period distribution of sdBs with confirmed WD companions is much wider (Morales-Rueda et al. 2003; Geier et al.\n2010b), but the combination of low mass and long period make\nEGB 5 peculiar. All known detached double-degenerate systems\nwith very low-mass WDs have much shorter periods (Steinfadt\net al. 2010 and references therein), which may again be caused\nby selection effects.\nFurthermore, EGB 5 may be the first very young post-CE\nsystem, where the ejected envelope is still visible (Mendez et al.\n1988a) and may provide direct evidence of this sdB formation\nchannel. This would make this binary a unique system to study\nthis short and poorly understood phase of binary evolution.\nPHL 932 has been regarded as a similar object. However, evidence that it has a close companion is not compelling. In addition, Frew et al. (2010) showed that the nebulous structure\naround PHL 932 is not a planetary nebula, but rather a Str\u00f6mgren\nsphere created by the hot sdB in the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. Since EGB 5 is located at relatively low Galactic latitude (+22.6\u25e6) this possibility should be seriously investigated.\nAcknowledgements. S.
