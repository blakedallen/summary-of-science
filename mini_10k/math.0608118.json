Bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and Hilbert coefficients\nare given in terms of the arithmetic degree (if the ring is reduced) or in terms of the\ndefining degrees. From this it follows that there exists only a finite number of Hilbert\nfunctions associated to reduced algebras over an algebraically closed field with a given\narithmetic degree and dimension. A good bound is also given for the CastelnuovoMumford regularity of initial ideals which depends neither on term orders nor on the\ncoordinates, and holds for any field.\n\nDedicated to Professor J. Herzog\non the occassion of his 65-th birthday.\nIntroduction\nIn the famous book SGA6, Kleiman proved that given two positive integers e and d,\nthere exists only a finite number of Hilbert functions associated to reduced and equidimensional K-algebras S over an algebraically closed field such that deg S \u2264 e and dim S = d\n(see [K, Corollary 6.11]). An easier and eleganter proof of this result can be found in\na recent paper by M. Rossi, N. V. Trung and G. Valla [RTV2]. Moreover, the paper\n[RTV2] gives a rather general approach to derive the finiteness of Hilbert functions. It\nis shown that this problem (for a certain class of ideals) is equivalent to the boundness\nof the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the embedding dimension (see [RTV2, Theorem 2.3]). The first main purpose of this paper is to extend Kleiman's result to reduced\nK-algebras. A key point is to find a suitable invariant to replace the degree. Of course,\na so-called extended degree is a choice, see [RVV, Corollary 4.4], but such an invariant is\nvery big. It turns out that in our situation one can take the so-called arithmetic degree a notion which maybe reflects better the complexity of ideals than the usual degree (see\n[BM, Section 3] and [V, Chapter 9]).\nTheorem 0.1. Given two positive integers a and d. Assume that K is an algebraically\nclosed field. Then there exists only a finite number of Hilbert functions associated to\nreduced K-algebras S such that adeg S \u2264 a and dim S = d.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13D45, 13D40, 13P10.\nKey words and phrases. Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, local cohomology, Hilbert function, Hilbert\npolynomial, initial ideal.\nThe author was supported in part by the National Basic Research Program (Vietnam). The final\npreparation of the article was done during his stay at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (Spain).\n1\n\n\fNote that the above result does not hold for an arbitrary algebra (however see [RVV,\nCorollary 4.4] and [RTV2, Theorem 3.1] for a possible generalization). As mentioned\nabove, the main point in the proof of Theorem 0.1 is to bound the Castelnuovo-Mumford\nregularity. This is not hard to do (see Remark 1.6). However, a careful analysis allows us\nto establish the following explicit bound:\nTheorem 0.2. Let K be an arbitrary field and I an arbitrary homogeneous ideal of\nR = K[x1 , ..., xn ]. Assume that S = R/I is a reduced ring of dimension d \u2265 2 and degree\ne. Then\ne(e \u2212 1)\nd\u22122\nreg I \u2264 (\n+ adeg I)2 .\n2\nApplied to the case of reduced and equidimensional algebras, the bound of Theorem\n0.2 is better than the one given in [RTV2, Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.3]. In view of the\nEisenbud-Goto conjecture, the above bound is still too big, but it is a first explicit bound\nstated in terms of the arithmetic degree. In order to prove it, as in Lecture 14 of [M]\n(see also [K], [BM] and [RTV2]), we proceed by induction on the dimension. However,\nthere is a different point: we simultaneously bound this invariant and the length of graded\ncomponents of certain local cohomology modules (see Theorem 1.5 and also Theorem 2.5).\nThe above technique can be also used to estimate the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity\nof arbitrary homogeneous ideals in terms of the maximal degree \u2206 of minimal generators\nof I \u2282 R = K[x1 , ..., xn ]. If K is any field of zero characteristic, from Giusti's paper\nn\u22122\n[Gi] it follows that reg(I) \u2264 (2\u2206)2 . Bayer and Mumford suggested that this bound\nholds in any characteristic (see the comment after Theorem 3.7 in [BM]). Not long ago,\nG. Caviglia and E. Sbarra proved that this is indeed the case:\nd\u22121\n\nreg I \u2264 (\u2206c + \u2206c \u2212 c + 1)2\n\n,\n\nwhere c = n \u2212 d (see [CS, Corollary 2.6]). In this paper we will give a completely different\nproof for a slight improvement of this result (see Theorem 2.1).\nThe next problem we are interested in is to give good bounds for the CastelnuovoMumford regularity of initial ideals in(I) with respect to any term order and in any\ncoordinates. Inspired by a result of Chardin and Moreno-Sosias, it was shown in [HH]\nthat if R/I is a Cohen-Macaulay ring of multiplicity e \u2265 2 and d \u2265 2, then reg(in(I)) \u2264\nd\u22121\nd\u22122\ne2 /22 . Long before that M. Giusti [Gi] showed that in characteristic zero we have\nn\u22121\nreg in(I) \u2264 (2\u2206)2 , provided the coordinates are chosen generically and the term order\nis the lexicographic order. Combining these facts with the above mentioned result of [CS]\nand [MM, II.2.2], one may ask whether such a kind of bounds still holds for any reg(in I).\nOur second main result confirms it:\nTheorem 0.3. Let K be an arbitrary field and and I an arbitrary homogeneous ideal of\nR. With respect to any term order and any coordinates we have\n3\nd\u22121\nreg(in I) \u2264 ( \u2206c + \u2206)d2 .\n2\nMoreover, if R/I is a reduced algebra, then we also have\nd\u22121\n\nreg(in I) \u2264 (adeg I)(n\u22121)2\n2\n\n.\n\n\fAn immediate consequence of this theorem says that the maximal degree of a reduced\nGr\u00f6bner base, with respect to any term order and any coordinates, is bounded by ( 23 \u2206c +\nd\u22121\n\u2206)d2 . In view of a remarkable example due to Mayr and Meyer, this bound is nearly\nthe best possible (see, e.g., Example 3.9 and Proposition 3.11 in [BM]).\nIn order to prove this theorem we develop further the method in [HH]. Instead of initial\nideals we consider a much bigger class: the class of all ideals J having the same Hilbert\nfunction as I. So, although the title of the paper is about initial ideals, we are in fact\ndealing not much with them. However, by doing so one can use Gotzmann's regularity\ntheorem to bound reg J in terms of some data of I. Then, by virtue of Theorem 0.2 and\nTheorem 2.1, we will see that the only thing left is to estimate the Hilbert coefficients ei\nin terms of \u2206 or adeg(I) (see Lemmas 6.1 and 6.3). This problem is also of independent\ninterest. Main steps to do it may be explained as follows. First, using a recent result\nby Herzog, Popescu and Vladoiu [HPV] one can bound cohomological Hilbert functions\n(i.e. the length of graded components of local cohomology modules) in terms of the\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity. From that we get bounds for the Hilbert coefficients by\nthe Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity (see theorems 4.1 and 4.6). The existence of such\na bound was predicted by [RTV2, Theorem 2.3], and this approach is somewhat new,\nbecause usually one tries to estimate the latter invariant by the former ones (see, e.g., [K]\nand [BrS, Section 17.2]). However, it is a surprising fact, that the relationships between\nthese invariants in theorems 4.1 and 4.6 are rather simple. Let us give here a simple\nversion of these results\nTheorem 0.4. Let e0 = e, ..., ed\u22121 be the Hilbert coefficents of R/I and b = max{\u2206, adeg I}.\nThen\n(i) |e1 | \u2264 bc reg I.\n(ii) For i \u2265 2, |ei | \u2264 32 bc (reg I)i .\nCombining theorems 4.1 and 4.6 with results on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity\nfound earlier we get bounds for |ei | in terms of \u2206 or adeg(I) (see propositions 4.3 and 4.7).\nThese bounds are huge: they are double exponential functions of i. But they are good\nenough to prove Theorem 0.3. Furthermore, theorems 4.1 and 4.6 sometimes give really\ngood bounds for |ei | if we already know a good estimation for the Castelnuovo-Mumford\nregularity (see corollaries 4.4 and 4.8).\nWe now give a brief content of the paper. We prove Theorem 0.2 in Section 1, and\nreprove in Section 2 the Caviglia-Sbarra bound on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of\nan arbitrary homogeneous ideal in terms of the degrees of its defining equations (Theorem\n2.1). Section 3 is devoted to bounding Hilbert cohomological functions in terms of the\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity (see Theorem 3.4). Bounds on Hilbert coefficients are\ngiven in Section 4. Putting results of the sections 1 and 4 together we are able to prove\nTheorem 0.1 without using [RTV2]. This is done in Section 5. Theorem 0.3 is proved in the\nlast Section 6. We refer the readers to Eisenbud's book [E] for unexplained terminology.\nAcknowledgment: The author would like to thank the Centre de Recerca Matematica\n(Spain) for the financial support and hospitality during the final preparation of this article.\n3\n\n\fHe is grateful to the referee for his/her useful remarks and suggestions which lead to an\nimprovement of some main results of the paper.\n1. Bounds in terms of the arithmetic degree\nThroughout this paper, if not otherwise stated, K is an arbitrary field, R = K[x1 , ..., xn ]\nis a polynomial ring and I \u2282 R is a homogeneous ideal of dimension d. However, all\ninvariants considered in this paper are not changed under passing from K to K(u), where\nu is a new indeterminates. Hence, in proofs we may always assume that K is an infinite\nfield. This assumption guarantees the choice of generic elements.\nLet c = n \u2212 d. Note that c is the true codimension of I if I does not contain a linear\nform. Let m = (x1 , ..., xn ) denote the maximal homogeneous ideal of R and set S = R/I.\nLet us recall some notions.\nFor an artinian Z-graded module N, let\nend(N) = max{t; Nt 6= 0}\n(with the convention max \u2205 = \u2212\u221e). Further, let\ni\nai (R/I) = end(Hm\n(R/I)),\ni\nwhere Hm\n(R/I) is the local cohomology module with the support in m and 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d.\nThe Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is the number\n\nreg(R/I) = max{ai (R/I) + i; 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d}.\nNote that reg(I) = reg(R/I) + 1. Sometimes we also use the notation\nregk (R/I) = max{ai (R/I) + i; k \u2264 i \u2264 d},\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is a non-negative integer.\nFollowing Brodmann and Sharp [BrS], the function\ni\nhiS (t) := l(Hm\n(S)t )\n\nis called the i-th Hilbert homological function of S, where l(.) denotes the dimension of\na vector space over K. Let HS (t) and PS (t) denote the Hilbert function and the Hilbert\npolynomial of S, respectively. We will often use the Grothendieck-Serre formula\nPS (t) \u2212 HS (t) =\n\nd\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+1 hiS (t).\n\n(2)\n\ni=0\n\nThe leading coefficient of PS (t), multiplied by (d \u2212 1)!, is called the degree of S and\ndenoted by deg S. We also denote deg S by e(S), or just by e. The arithmetic degree is\ndefined as follows:\nadeg S = adeg I =\n\n0\n(Rp/Ip)) deg(R/p),\nl(Hm\np\n\nX\n\np\u2208Ass(R/I)\n0\n(see [BM, Definition 3.4] and [V, Definition 9.13]). The number l(Hm\n(Rp/Ip)) is the\np\nmultiplicity of the component p with respect to I. In this definition p runs over all\n\n4\n\n\fassociated primes of S, while the usual degree deg S can be computed by a similar formula,\nbut the sum is only taken over primes of the highest dimension. Thus\nadeg S \u2265 deg S,\nand the equality holds if and only if S is a pure-dimensional ring.\nIn this section we prove Theorem 0.2. We need some auxiliary results.\nLemma 1.1. Let S be an one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring. Then\nh1S (0) + * * * + h1S (reg S \u2212 1) \u2264 e(e \u2212 1)/2.\nProof. Since PS (t) = e, from the Grothendieck-Serre formula (2) we have\nh1S (t) = e \u2212 HS (t).\nLet r = reg S. Since S is a Cohen-Macaulay ring, its Hilbert-Poincare series can be\nwritten in the form\nX\n1 + h1 z + * * * + hr z r\nHPS (z) :=\nHS (i)z i =\n,\n1\u2212z\ni\u22650\nwhere h1 , ..., hr are positive integers (see, e.g., [V, p. 240]). From this it follows that\nHS (t) = 1 + h1 + * * * + ht \u2265 t + 1\nfor all t \u2264 r. Moreover, under the Cohen-Macaulay assumption, r \u2264 e \u2212 1 . Hence\nh1S (0) + * * * + h1S (reg S \u2212 1) \u2264 re \u2212 (1 + * * * + r) = r(2e \u2212 r \u2212 1)/2 \u2264 e(e \u2212 1)/2.\n\u0003\nLemma 1.2. Assume that S = R/I is a reduced ring of dimension at least two. Then\nh1S (\u22121) \u2264 adeg I \u2212 e.\nProof. Since S is reduced, one may write I = J \u2229 Q, where J is the intersection of all\nassociated primes of R/I of dimension at least 2, and Q is the intersection of all associated\nprimes of R/I of dimension 1. By [HSV, Lemma 1] we have h1R/J (\u22121) = 0. Thus if Q = R,\nthen h1S (\u22121) = 0. Assume that Q 6= R. Since J 6= R and R/I has no embedded primes,\nJ + Q is an m-primary ideal, i.e. dim R/(J + Q) = 0. The exact sequence\n0 \u2192 S \u2192 R/J \u2295 R/Q \u2192 R/(J + Q) \u2192 0\nimplies\nh1S (\u22121) = h1R/J (\u22121) + h1R/Q (\u22121) = h1R/Q (\u22121).\nNote that deg R/Q = adeg I \u2212 adeg J \u2264 adeg I \u2212 e. Since R/Q is an one-dimensional ring,\nby the Grothendieck-Serre formula, we have\nh1R/Q (\u22121) = deg R/Q \u2264 adeg I \u2212 e.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Theorem 0.2 is proceeded by induction. The next two lemmas allow us\nto do induction. The first one is concerning the behavior of the arithmetic degree by\nhyperplane section. It is more subtle than the usual degree, see [MVY]. However we have\n5\n\n\fLemma 1.3. Let K be an infinite field, and S = R/I an arbitrary ring of dimension at\nleast two and positive depth. Assume that xn is chosen generically. Let T = R/((I, xn ) :\nm\u221e ) and r = reg T . Then:\n(i) reg T \u2264 reg S.\n(ii) adeg T \u2264 adeg S.\nProof. (i) Since xn is generic, it is a regular element on S. We have\nreg T = reg1 S/xn S \u2264 reg S/xn S = reg S.\n(ii) For an R-module M and r \u2265 \u22121, let\nadegr (M) =\n\n0\nl(Hm\n(Mp)) deg(R/p)\np\n\nX\n\np\u2208Ass(M ), dim R/p=r+1\n\n(see [BM, Definition 3.4]).

In order to make the paper more self-contained, we give here\na sketch of the proof. The proof of (iii) here is also simpler.\nLemma 1.4. Let K be an infinite field and S = R/I a reduced ring of dimension at least\ntwo. Assume that xn is chosen generically. Let T = R/((I, xn ) : m\u221e ) and r = reg T .\nThen T is also a reduced ring and we have\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\nreg2 (S) \u2264 r (see the definition in (1)).\nh1S (t) \u2265 h1S (t + 1) for all t \u2265 r \u2212 1.\nreg S \u2264 r + h1S (r \u2212 1).\nh1S (t) \u2264 h1T (0) + * * * + h1T (t) + adeg I \u2212 e, for all t \u2265 0.\n\nProof. Note that T can be considered as the homogeneous coordinate ring of a generic\nhyperplane section of the scheme Proj(S). Since K is an infinite ring and xn is generic,\nby Bertini's theorem [FOV, Corollary 3.4.14] it follows that T is reduced.\nThe long exact sequence\n\u03c6t\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n(S/xn S)t = Hm\n(T )t\n0 \u2192 Hm\n(S/xn S)t \u2192 Hm\n(S)t\u22121 \u2192 Hm\n(S)t \u2212\u2192Hm\n2\n2\n\u2192 Hm\n(S)t\u22121 \u2192 Hm\n(S)t \u2192 * * *\n\n6\n\n(3)\n\n\fimplies (i) and the short exact sequence\n0\n1\n1\n0 \u2192 Hm\n(S/xn S)t \u2192 Hm\n(S)t\u22121 \u2192 Hm\n(S)t \u2192 0\n\nfor all t \u2265 r. This yields (ii). If h1S (t0 \u2212 1) \u2265 h1S (t0 ) for some t0 \u2265 r + 1, we would have\nh0S/xn S (t0 ) = 0. Since reg1 (S/xn S) = reg T = r, it then implies that reg(S/xn S) \u2264 t0 .\nHence h1S (t0 ) = h1S (t0 + 1) = * * * = 0. Therefore h1S (t) is strictly decreasing to zero when\nt \u2265 r, which implies (iii).\nIt remains to show (iv). From the exact sequence (3) we have\nh1S (u) \u2212 h1S (u \u2212 1) = l(Im(\u03c6u )) \u2212 h0S/xn S (u) \u2264 h1T (u)\nfor all u \u2208 Z. Adding these inequalities and using Lemma 1.2 we get\nh1S (t) \u2264 h1T (0) + * * * + h1T (t) + h1S (\u22121)\n\u2264 h1T (0) + * * * + h1T (t) + adeg I \u2212 e\nfor all t \u2265 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 0.2 is a part of the following result. If a \u2208 R, we denote by [a] the largest\ninteger not exceeding a.\nTheorem 1.5. Assume that S = R/I is a reduced ring of dimension at least two.

We may assume that xn is generic and choose T as in the previous lemma. Hence\nT is a reduced ring. Set r = reg T .\nLet d = 2. In order to show (ii), by Lemma 1.4(ii), we may assume that t \u2264 r \u2212 1.\nNote that T is a Cohen-Macaulay ring and e(T ) = e. Then Lemma 1.4(iv) and Lemma\n1.1 yield:\nh1S (t) \u2264 h1T (0) + * * * + h1T (t) + adeg I \u2212 e\n\u2264 h1T (0) + * * * + h1T (r \u2212 1) + adeg I \u2212 e\n\u2264 e(e\u22121)\n+ adeg I \u2212 e = m \u2212 e.\n2\nUsing this inequality and the fact that r \u2264 e \u2212 1 (since T is a Cohen-Macaulay ring), by\nLemma 1.4(iii) we get\nreg S \u2264 e \u2212 1 + m \u2212 e = m \u2212 1.\nThus the case d = 2 is proven.\nLet d \u2265 3. Since dim T = d \u2212 1, e(T ) = e, and adeg T \u2264 adeg S (by Lemma 1.3(ii)),\nthe induction hypothesis gives\nd\u22123\n\nr \u2264 m2\n\n\u2212 1,\n\n(4)\n\nand for all t \u2265 0\nd\u22123\n\nh1T (t) \u2264 m2\n\nd\u22124 ]\n\n\u2212 e * m[2\n7\n\nd\u22123\n\n\u2264 m2\n\n\u2212 e.\n\n(5)\n\n\fIn order to prove (ii), again by Lemma 1.4(ii), we may assume that t \u2264 r \u2212 1.

In order to get a bound for reg S in terms of adeg S and d, by induction on\nd, it suffices to estimate h1S (t) for t \u2265 0. This can be easily done by using the following\nwell-known inequality\n!\nt\n+\nd\n\u2212\n1\nh1S (t) + HS (t) \u2264 adeg S\nd\u22121\n(recall that S is reduced). This was pointed out by the referee. However a direct application of this inequality would only lead to a bound of the following type\nreg I \u2264 (adeg I)d\u22121)! .\nIf K is an algebraically closed field, then a result of Gruson, Lazarsfeld and Peskine\n[GLP] yields a better bound for the case d = 2 as shown in the following statement.\nProposition 1.7. Let K be an algebraically closed field. Assume that R/I is a reduced\nring of dimension two. Then reg I \u2264 adeg I.\nProof. Write I = J \u2229 Q as in the proof of Lemma 1.2. Then we have an exact sequence:\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0 \u2192 Hm\n(R/J + Q)t \u2192 Hm\n(R/I)t \u2192 Hm\n(R/J)t \u2295 Hm\n(R/Q)t \u2192 0,\n\nand\n\n2\n2\n2\n(R/J)t \u2295 Hm\n(R/Q)t .\nHm\n(R/I)t \u223c\n= Hm\nBy [GLP, Theorem 1.1] (see also Remark on p. 497 there), reg R/J \u2264 e \u2212 1 \u2264 adeg I \u2212 1.\nSo we may assume that Q 6= R. Since R/Q is one-dimensional and reduced, it is a\nCohen-Macaulay ring. Hence reg R/Q \u2264 adeg R/Q \u2212 1 < adeg I. To complete the proof\nit suffices to show that\n0\nHm\n(R/J + Q)t = 0 for all t \u2265 adeg I \u2212 1.\n\nSince reg J \u2264 e, J is generated by elements of degree \u2264 e. Hence one may choose an\nelement x \u2208 J of degree e such that x does not belong to any prime in Q, i.e. x is a\nregular element on R/Q. Then we have\nreg R/(Q, x) = reg R/Q + e \u2212 1 \u2264 deg R/Q \u2212 1 + e \u2212 1 = adeg I \u2212 2.\nSince R/(Q, x) is a zero-dimensional ring, this means (R/(Q, x))t = 0 for all t \u2265 adeg I \u22121.\n0\nThe inequality l((R/J + Q)t ) \u2264 l((R/(Q, x))t ) gives us Hm\n(R/J + Q)t = (R/J + Q)t = 0\nfor all t \u2265 adeg I \u2212 1, as required.\n\u0003\n8\n\n\fThe above proposition says that in dimension two one can replace m by adeg S in\nTheorem 1.5(i). However this does not work for Theorem 1.5(ii) as shown by the following\nexample.\nExample 1.8. Given e \u2265 6 and S = K[xe , xe\u22121 y, xy e\u22121, y e ]. Then for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 e \u2212 2 one\ncan show that h1S (t) = te + 1 \u2212 (t + 1)2 , while adeg S \u2212 e = 0. Taking t0 = [ e\u22122\n], one can\n2\n1\nsee that hS (t0 ) is approximately a half of the bound in Theorem 1.5(ii).\nTheorem 0.2 does not hold if the ring R/I is not reduced.\nExample 1.9. (see [V, Example 9.3.1]) Let S = K[x, y, u, v]/((x, y)2, xut + yv t), t \u2265 1.\nThen adeg S = e = 2, while reg S = t can be arbitrarily large.\n2. Bounds in terms of degrees of defining equations\nIn this section we study arbitrary homogeneous ideals. We will always write the degrees\nof polynomials in a minimal homogeneous basis of I in a decreasing sequence\n\u2206 := \u03b41 \u2265 \u03b42 \u2265 * * *\nand assume \u2206 \u2265 2. As mentioned in the introduction, G. Caviglia and E. Sbarra already\nproved that\nd\u22121\nreg I \u2264 (\u2206c + \u2206c \u2212 c + 1)2\n(see [CS, Corollary 2.6]). The purpose of this section is to prove the following theorem\nwhich is a slight improvement of the above result.\nTheorem 2.1. Let K be an arbitrary field and I be an arbitrary homogeneous ideal of\ndimension d \u2265 1. Then\nd\u22121\n\nreg I \u2264 (\u03b41 * * * \u03b4c + \u2206 \u2212 1)2\n\nd\u22121\n\n\u2264 (\u2206c + \u2206 \u2212 1)2\n\n.\n\nThe proof of [CS] uses properties of Borel-fixed ideals. The proof here is completely\ndifferent and simpler than the one in [CS]. The main idea of the proof is similar to that\nof Theorem 0.2. We need some technical lemmas. For short, set\n\u03c3 = \u03b41 + * * * + \u03b4c \u2212 c and \u03c0 = \u03b41 * * * \u03b4c .\nIf S = R/I, then we also write \u2206 = \u2206(S), \u03b41 = \u03b41 (S), ... to emphasize their dependence on S (or I). The following result was pointed out by the referee to the author.\nSubsequently, it slightly improves our original Theorem 2.5 and Theorem 6.4\nLemma 2.2.

Keep the notation of Lemma 2.4. Let I \u2032 denote the image of I in K[x1 , ..., xn ]/(xn ) \u223c\n=\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u223c\nK[x1 , ..., xn\u22121 ] =: R . Then T = R /I and it is clear that \u03c3(I ) \u2264 \u03c3 and \u03c0(I ) \u2264 \u03c0.\nFirst let d = 1. With the above remark, Lemma 2.3 yields h0S (t) \u2264 \u03c0 \u2212 1 for all t \u2265 1.\nThus (ii) holds. By Lemma 2.2,\nreg S \u2264 \u03b41 + \u03b42 + * * * + \u03b4c \u2212 c + \u2206 \u2212 1.\nBy induction on c we get\nreg S \u2264 (\u03b41 * * * \u03b4c\u22121 \u2212 1) + (\u03b4c \u2212 1) + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2264 \u03b41 * * * \u03b4c \u2212 1 + \u2206 \u2212 1 = \u03c0 + \u2206 \u2212 2.\nThus the case d = 1 is proven.\nNow let d \u2265 2.

It was shown\nthat there is an ideal I, due to Mayr and Meyer, generated by 10n \u2212 6 forms of degree at\nn\u22121\nmost 4 in 10n + 1 variables such that reg(I) > 42 + 1 (see, e.g., [BM, Example 3.9 and\nProposition 3.11]).\nb) In this paper we are not interested in giving the best possible bounds for reg S which\nare then more complicated to formulate. On the other hand, for rings of small dimension,\nthere are also some bounds which are much better than the ones in Theorem 2.1. See,\ne.g., a recent paper [CF] for d \u2264 2. However an application of such results to our proof\ndoes not significantly improve the bound in Theorem 2.5 for a larger d.\n3. Hilbert cohomological functions\nIn this section we give a bound on hiS (t). First, we do this for Borel-fixed ideals. We\nneed some notation and results from [HPV]. Let I 6= 0 be a monomial ideal. Denote by\nG(I) the unique set of monomial generators of I. For a monomial u, let m(u) be the\nmaximal index of a variable appeared in u. Set\nm(I) = max{m(u); u \u2208 G(I)}.\nWe recursively define an ascending chain of monomial ideals\nI = I0 \u2282 I1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Il+1 = R\nas follows: let I0 = I. Suppose Ij is already defined. If Ij = R, then the chain ends.\nOtherwise, let nj = m(Ij ) and set\n\u221e\nk\nIj+1 = Ij : x\u221e\nnj := \u222ak=1 Ij : xnj .\n\nA stable ideal under the action of upper triangle matrices is called Borel-fixed. It is\nalways a monomial ideal. If I is a Borel-fixed ideal, then (x1 , ..., xc ) is the unique minimal\nassociated prime of R/I (see [E, Corollary 15.25]). Hence in this case n \u2265 n0 > n1 > * * * >\nnl = c. For j = 0, ..., l, let Jj \u2282 K[x1 , ..., xnj ] be the monomial ideal with G(Ij ) = G(Jj ).\nDenote by\nJjsat = Jj : (x1 , ..., xnj )\u221e\nthe saturation of Jj . Then by [HPV, Corollary 2.6] and local duality we have\nj\nLemma 3.1. Let I 6= 0 be a Borel-fixed ideal.

Let Gin I denote the generic initial ideal of I with respect to the reverse lexicographic order. Then Gin I is a Borel-fixed ideal. Moreover we may assume that the\ncoordinates x1 , .., xn are chosen generically. By [BS, Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.4] we\nhave\nl(R/(I, xc+1 , ..., xn )) = l(R/(Gin I, xc+1 , ..., xn )),\nand\nreg(R/I) = reg(R/ Gin I).\nBy Macaulay's theorem: e(R/I) = e(R/ Gin I). Moreover, by [S, Theorem 2.4]\nhiR/I (t) \u2264 hiR/ Gin I (t)\nfor all i \u2265 0 and t \u2208 Z. Hence, the theorem immediately follows from the previous lemma\nif we can show that\nB := l(R/(I, xc+1, ..., xn )) \u2264 b.\na) Let I \u2032 denote the image of I in R\u2032 = R/(xc+1 , ..., xn ) \u223c\n= K[x1 , ..., xc ]. It is a (x1 , ..., xc )primary ideal. Since I can be generated by elements of degrees d1 \u2264 \u03b41 , d2 \u2264 \u03b42 , ..., I \u2032\ncontains a regular sequence consisting of forms f1 , ..., fc of degrees d\u20321 \u2264 d1 \u2264 \u03b41 , ..., d\u2032c \u2264\ndc \u2264 \u03b4c . Hence\nB = l(R\u2032 /I \u2032 ) \u2264 l(R\u2032 /(f1 , ..., fc )) = d\u20321 * * * d\u2032c \u2264 \u03b41 * * * \u03b4c .\nb) Since xc+1 , ..., xn is a s.o.p. of R/ Gin(I), it is also a s.o.p. of R/I. Hence it is a\nminimal reduction of the algebra R/I. By [V, Theorem 9.3.4]\nadeg(I)\n\nxi\nadeg(I)\n\nThis means x1\nB \u2264 (adeg I)c .\n\n\u2208 (I, xc+1 , ..., xn ), for all i \u2265 1.\n\n, ..., xadeg(I)\nform a regular sequence in I \u2032 . The above argument gives\nc\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.5. i) In the above theorem we may replace b by (reg I)c in order to get a\nbound for hjS (t), which depends only on reg I and d, c.\nii) Hilbert cohomological functions are of reverse polynomial type, i.e. for each i \u2265 0\nthere is a polynomial piS (t) such that hiS (t) = piS (t) for all t \u226a 0 (see [BrS, Theorem\n17.1.9]). The number\n\u03bdSi = min{t \u2208 Z; hiS (t) 6= piS (t)} \u2212 1\ni\nis called i-th cohomological postulation number of S (see [BrL]). Thus, if Hm\n(S), i < d\ni\ni\nis of finite length, then all graded components Hm(S)t vanish below \u03bdS . Brodmann and\nLashgari proved that all \u2212\u03bdSi , i \u2264 d, can be bounded by a polynomial (of huge degree)\nin the numbers h1S (0), ..., hdS (\u2212d + 1) (see [BrL, Theorem 4.6]). Combining their result\nwith Theorem 3.4 we see that \u2212\u03bdSi can be bounded by a polynomial in reg S. Thus, the\nnumber of \"irregular\" negative components of local cohomology modules is governed by\nthe Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.\n\n14\n\n\f4.

Note that e0 = e. Sometimes we\nalso write ei = ei (S) to emphasize its dependence on S.\nWe first estimate |ei | in terms of the arithmetic degree. For the application later, the\nfollowing result is formulated in a rather technical way.\nTheorem 4.1. Let K be an infinite field and I an arbitrary homogeneous ideal. Assume\nthat xc+1 , ..., xn are chosen generically. Let Td = R/(I : m\u221e ), Td\u22121 = R/((I, xn ) : m\u221e ), ....\nThen\n(i) |e1 | \u2264 (adeg I)c (reg T2 + 1) \u2264 (adeg I)c reg I.\n(ii) For i \u2265 2, |ei | \u2264 32 (adeg I)c (reg Ti+1 + 1)i \u2264 23 (adeg I)c (reg I)i .\nProof. The second inequalities in both (i) and (ii) follow from Lemma 1.3(i). Let us prove\nthe first ones. Set T = Td . Let HT (t) denote the Hilbert function of T . Since S and T\nhave the same Hilbert polynomial, ei = ei (T ) for all i \u2265 0. From the Grothendieck-Serre\nformula\nPT (t) \u2212 HT (t) =\n\nd\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+1 hiT (t),\n\ni=0\n\nwe get (setting t = \u22121):\n(\u22121)d\u22121 ed\u22121 = C \u2212 D,\nwhere\nC = h1T (\u22121) + h3T (\u22121) * * * ,\nand\nD = h2T (\u22121) + h4T (\u22121) * * * .\nHence\n|ed\u22121 | \u2264 max{C, D}.\nFor short, set b = (adeg I)c . If d = 2, then by Theorem 3.4 we have C = h1T (\u22121) \u2264\n(b \u2212 1)(reg T + 1) and D = h2T (\u22121) \u2264 b * reg T . Therefore |e1 | \u2264 b * (reg T2 + 1).\nLet d \u2265 3. Since xn is generic, it is a regular element on T . Since PTd\u22121 (t) = PT /xn T (t),\nwe have ei = ei (T ) = ei (Td\u22121 ) for all i \u2264 d \u2212 2. The corresponding sequence of rings\nconstructed for Td\u22121 as above are exactly the rings Td\u22121 , Td\u22122 , ..., T1 . By Lemma 1.3(ii),\nadeg Td\u22121 \u2264 adeg T .

We have\ne1 = \u2212(t + 1), while reg(S) = t, adeg S = 2 and the bound in (i) of the above theorem is\n4(t + 1). Thus one cannot avoid reg I in the above theorem.\nNote that dim Ti+1 = i + 1.

Assume that K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and\nProj(R/I) is a reduced and pure-dimensional smooth subscheme in Pn\u22121 . Then for all\ni \u2265 1 we have\n|ei | < (i + 2)i ec+i .\nProof. By Bertini's theorems (see [FOV, Corollary 3.4.6 and Corollary 3.4.14]) we may\nassume that all Proj(Ti ) are reduced and pure-dimensional smooth subschemes. By Mumford's bound: reg Ti+1 \u2264 (i + 2)(e \u2212 2) + 1 (see [BM, Theorem 3.12(ii)]). Moreover, in this\ncase h1Ti+1 (\u22121) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 and adeg I = e . Hence, by Theorem 4.1 and Remark 4.2,\nwe get\n|ei | \u2264 ec ((i + 2)(e \u2212 2) + 2)i < (i + 2)i ec+i .\n\u0003\nRemark 4.5. Let S be a reduced ring of dimension at least two.\ni) It is known that for any K-algebra S, e1 \u2264 e(e \u2212 1)/2 (see [Bl, Remark 3.10]).\nHence in the statement (i) of Proposition 4.3 only the following inequality is new: e1 \u2265\n\u2212(adeg S)c ( e(e\u22121)\n+ adeg S).\n2\nii) Let us recall\n16\n\n\fEisenbud-Goto conjecture [EG]: Let K be an algebraically closed field. If I is a prime\nideal containing no linear form, then reg R/I \u2264 e \u2212 c.\nIf this conjecture holds true, then by Remark 4.2, |ei | \u2264 (deg S)c+i provided S is\na domain. Note that the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture is close to be proved for smooth\nvarieties of dimension at most 6 over a field of characteristic zero, by the work of several\npeople including Lazarsfeld, Ran and Kwak. This indicates that the bounds in Theorem\n0.2 and Proposition 4.3 are probably far from being sharp.\niii) There is a bound on |ei | in terms of the so-called homological degree which also\nholds for any standard graded algebra over an artinian ring, see [RVV, Theorem 4.3].\nHowever the homological degree is very big.\nWe now estimate |ei | by mean of the defining degrees. Recall that homogeneous elements y1 , ..., ym of S form a filter regular sequence if [(y1 , ..., yi\u22121 ) : yi ]t = (y1, ..., yi\u22121 )t\nfor all t \u226b 0 and i = 0, ..., m.

We may assume that xc+1 , ..., xn are chosen generically. In particular, xc+1 , ..., xn\nform a s.o.p. of S. Set B = l(S/(xc+1 , ..., xn )S). By [RVV, Proposition 2.4] for all t \u2265 0\nwe have\n!\n!\nt+d\u22121\nt+d\u22122\n.\n+\nHS (t) \u2264 (B \u2212 1)\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\nAs shown in the proof of Theorem 3.4, B \u2264 b. Hence the lemma is proven.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 5.2. Assume that K is an algebraically closed field, I is an intersection of prime\nideals and I contains no linear form. Then c \u2264 d(adeg I \u2212 1).\n18\n\n\fProof. By the assumption\nI = \u2229si=1 pi ,\nwhere pi are prime ideals of height at least c. Since s \u2264 adeg I, the statement is derived\nfrom the following inequality\nc \u2264 adeg I \u2212 s + (s \u2212 1)d.\nWe prove this inequality by induction on s. The case s = 1 is well known. Let s > 1. Put\ns\u22121\nJ = \u2229i=1\npi . Let a and b be the maximal number of independent linear forms contained in J\nand ps , respectively. By the induction hypothesis, we have c\u2212a \u2264 adeg J \u2212(s\u22121)+(s\u22122)d\nand c \u2212 b \u2264 e(R/ps ) \u2212 1. Since adeg I = adeg J + e(R/ps ), we get\n2c \u2264 adeg I \u2212 s + (s \u2212 2)d + a + b.\nIf a + b > n it would imply that there is a linear form in J \u2229 ps = I, a contradiction.\nHence a + b \u2264 n = d + c. The above inequality then yields c \u2264 adeg I \u2212 s + (s \u2212 1)d. \u0003\nAs mentioned in the introduction, Theorem 0.1 is an immediate consequence of Theorem\n0.2, Lemma 5.2 and [RTV2, Theorem 2.3]. We give here a direct proof without the use\nof [RTV2].\nProof of Theorem 0.1. Without the loss of generality we may assume from the beginning\nthat I contains no linear form. Note that e \u2264 adeg S. Therefore, by Proposition 4.3\nand Lemma 5.2, there are only finitely many Hilbert polynomials associated to reduced\nalgebras such that adeg S \u2264 a and dim S \u2264 d. By Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, there are only\nfinitely many choices for the initial values of Hilbert functions, while Theorem 0.2 says\nd\u22122\nthat for t \u2265 ( e(e\u22121)\n+ adeg S)2\neach Hilbert function agrees with the corresponding\n2\nHilbert polynomial. This implies the finiteness of the number of Hilbert functions.\n\u0003.\nExample 1.9 shows that without the assumption S being a reduced ring Theorem 0.1\ndoes not hold.\nApplying Proposition 4.7 and Theorem 2.1, as in the proof of Theorem 0.1, we get a\nsimilar finiteness result in terms of the defining degrees.\nCorollary 5.3. Given two numbers \u03b4 and n, there exist only finitely many Hilbert functions associated to homogeneous ideals generated by forms of degrees at most \u03b4 in at most\nn variables.\n6. Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of initial ideals\nIn this last section we apply results in the previous sections to study the CastelnuovoMumford regularity of an initial ideal in(I) of I with respect to any given term order and\ncoordinates. We even consider a much bigger class: the class of all ideals J having the\nsame Hilbert function as I. Then one can easily bound reg J in terms of some data of I.\nThis approach was initiated in [CM] and developed further in [HH]. Let us recall some\n19\n\n\fnotations. The Hilbert polynomial can be uniquely written in the form\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\ncs + t \u2212 s + 1\nc2 + t \u2212 1\nc1 + t\n,\n+***+\n+\nPR/I (t) =\nt\u2212s+1\nt\u22121\nt\nwhere c1 \u2265 c2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 cs \u2265 0 are integers (see, e.g., [V, Section B6]). For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d \u2212 1\nset\nBi = \u266f{j; cj \u2265 (d \u2212 1) \u2212 i}.\nThus in the above notations, s = Bd\u22121 (for convenience, we set B\u22121 = 0). The following\nresult easily follows from Gotzmann's regularity theorem:\nLemma 6.1. [HH, Lemma 5] Let I, J be homogeneous ideals having the same Hilbert\nfunction. Then\nreg J \u2264 max{reg I, Bd\u22121 }.\nSince we already know bounds for reg(I) (see Theorems 0.2 and 2.1), we have only to\nestimate Bd\u22121 . For this purpose we need some relations between the invariants Bi just\ndefined and the Hilbert coefficients which were given in [Bl, Proposition 3.9] (see also\n[CM, Lemma 1.5]).\nLemma 6.2. For all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 d \u2212 1 we have\n!\n\n!\n\n!\n\nB0 + 1\nBi\u22122 + 1\nBi\u22121 + 1\n.\n+ * * * + (\u22121)i+1\n\u2212\nBi = (\u22121) ei +\ni+1\n3\n2\ni\n\nNote that Bd\u22121 \u2265 * * * \u2265 B0 = e. In order to estimate Bj , we need the following\ncombinatorial result.\nLemma 6.3. Assume that\ni\n\n|ei | \u2264 M \u03b1+i\u03b22\n\nfor all i \u2265 0,\n\nwhere M \u2265 2 and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2265 1. Then for all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 d \u2212 1 we have\nj\n\nBj \u2264 M (\u03b1+j\u03b2)2 .\nProof. We have B0 = e = e0 \u2264 M \u03b1 by the assumption. By Lemma 6.2 the following holds\n!\n\ne(e + 1)\nB0 + 1\n\u2264 |e1 | +\nB1 = \u2212e1 +\n< M \u03b1+2\u03b2 + M 2\u03b1 \u2264 M 2(\u03b1+\u03b2) (since M \u2265 2).\n2\n2\nLet j \u2265 2.

Hence, Theorem 0.3 stated\nin the introduction is a special case of the following result.\nTheorem 6.4. Let K be an arbitrary field. Let J be an arbitrary homogeneous ideal of\nR = K[x1 , ..., xn ] such that HR/J (t) = HR/I (t) for all t. Then\nd\u22121\n\n(i) reg(J) \u2264 ( 32 \u2206c + \u2206)d2 .\n(ii) Moreover, if R/I is a reduced algebra, then we also have\nd\u22121\n\nreg(J) \u2264 (adeg(I))(n\u22121)2\n\n.\n\ni\n\nProof. (i) By Proposition 4.7, |ei | < ( 32 \u2206c + \u2206)1+i2 for all i \u2265 0. Applying Lemma 6.3 to\nd\u22121\nM = 32 \u2206c + \u2206, \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 1 and j = d \u2212 1, we get Bd\u22121 \u2264 ( 32 \u2206c + \u2206)d2 . Then (i)\nfollows from Lemma 6.1 and Theorem 2.1.\n(ii) For short, set a = adeg I. Note that a \u2265 e and\ne(e \u2212 1)\n+ a \u2264 a2 .\n2\n\n(13)\n\nHence, by Proposition 4.3(i)\n|e1 | \u2264 ac+2 .\nLet i \u2265 2. Since \u2206 \u2265 2, a \u2265 2. By Proposition 4.3(ii) and (13), we have\n)i2 = ac ( a(a+1)\n)i2\n|ei | \u2264 32 ac ( a(a+1)\n2\n2\nc+2(i2i\u22121 \u22124) 8\nc+i2i\n\u2264a\na =a\n.\ni\u22121\n\ni\u22121 \u22124\n\n* [ 23 ( a(a+1)\n)4 ]\n2\n\nThus, applying Lemma 6.3 to M = a, \u03b1 = c, \u03b2 = 1 and j = d \u2212 1, we get Bd\u22121 \u2264\nd\u22121\nd\u22121\na(n\u22121)2 . By Lemma 6.1 and Theorem 0.2 this implies reg J \u2264 a(n\u22121)2 .\n\u0003\nNote that if R/I is a Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension d \u2265 2 (but not necessarily\nreduced), then one can get a little bit better bound (see [HH, Theorem 9]):\nd\u22121\n\nreg J \u2264 e2\n\nd\u22122\n\n/22\n\n.\n\nExample 6.5. Let I lex denote the lex-segment ideal associated to the Hilbert function\nHR/I (t). This is the ideal generated by all first HI (m) monomials of degrees m with\nrespect to the lexicographic order, when m runs through all positive integers. It has the\nsame Hilbert function as I. If R/I is a Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension d \u2265 2, then\nfrom [CM, Theorem 2.5] it follows that reg(I lex ) = Bd\u22121 .\n21\n\n\fi) Let I be an ideal generated by a regular sequence consisting of forms of degrees\n\u03b41 \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03b4c such that c \u2265 2 and \u03b42 \u2265 35 (d \u2265 2). It was shown in [HH, Example 13]\nthat\nd\u22121\n\u2206c2\nlex\nreg(I ) \u2265 9 2d\u22122 .\n9\nThis shows that the bound in Theorem 6.4(i) is close to be sharp.\nii) Let S be a Veronesian embedding K[y1 , ..., yd ](p) , i.e. S1 is generated by all monomials\nof degree\u0010p in the\n\u0011 variables y1 , ..., yd , where d \u2265 3. This is a Cohen-Macaulay domain and\npt+d\u22121\nPS (t) = d\u22121 . Hence adeg S = e = pd\u22121 and e1 = dpd\u22122 (p \u2212 1). Let p \u2265 35. Then\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ne1 < e2 /36 and e \u2265 352 . Let S = K[x1 , ..., xq ]/I, where q = p+d\u22121\n. By [HH, Proposition\nd\u22121\n12] we get\nd\u22121\ne2\nreg(I lex ) \u2265 9 2d\u22122 .\n9\nThis shows that the bound in the second part of Theorem 6.4 is close to be sharp too.\n\nSince reg(in I) \u2265 reg I, the ideals of Mayr and Meyer again show that the bound\nd\u22121\n(2\u2206c )d2 of Theorem 0.3 is rather good (see Remark 2.6). We do not know whether one\ncan construct a reduced algebra R/I such that there is a term order with reg(in I) close\nd\u22121\nto (adeg(I))(n\u22121)2 .\nFinally we would like to make the following remark: In the proof of Theorem 0.3 we use\nvery rough estimation for reg I and |ei |. It could suspect that if reg I and |ei | are small,\nthen one could get a bound for reg(in I), which would be a single exponent of d. But this\nis not the case as shown by [HH, Section 4].\nReferences\n[BM ] D. Bayer and D. Mumford, What can be computed in algebraic geometry?
