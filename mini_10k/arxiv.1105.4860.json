Electron\nmotion is described by the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary condition. The\npart of waveguide between the narrows plays the role of resonator and there can occur\nelectron resonant tunneling.

In the present paper, we compare the asymptotics of Eres = Eres (\u03b5)\nand T (E) = T (E, \u03b5) as \u03b5 \u2192 0 with the corresponding numerical results obtained by\napproximate computing the waveguide scattering matrix. We show that there exists\na band of \u03b5 where the asymptotics and numerical results are in close agreement.

On the other hand, the asymptotics gives way to\nthe numerical method as \u03b5 increases; in fact, for wide narrows the resonant tunneling\nvanishes by itself.\nThough, in the present paper, we consider only a 2D waveguide, the applicability\nof the methods goes far beyond the above simplest model. In particular, the same\napproach will work for asymptotic and numerical analysis of resonant tunneling in 3D\nquantum waveguides.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs an electron propagates in a quantum waveguide of variable cross-section, the waveguide\nnarrows play the role of effective potential barriers for the longitudinal motion. The part\nof the waveguide between two narrows becomes a \"resonator\" , and there can arise resonant\ntunneling. It consists of the fact that, for an electron with energy E, the probability T (E) to\npass from one part of the waveguide to the other through the resonator has a sharp peak at\nE = Eres , where Eres denotes a resonant energy. There are prospects for building a new class\nof nanosize electronics elements (transistors, electron energy monochromators, key devices)\nbased on the phenomenon of resonant tunneling. To analyze their operation, it is important\nto know Eres , the height of the resonant peak, the behavior of T (E) for E close to Eres , etc.\nIn [1], electron propagation was considered in a 3D waveguide with two cylindrical\noutlets to infinity and two narrows of small diameter \u03b51 and \u03b52 . The electron motion was\ndescribed by the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary condition, radiation condition,\nand a wave number k between the first and the second thresholds. For the aforementioned\ncharacteristics of resonant tunneling, there were obtained asymptotics as \u03b51 , \u03b52 \u2192 0. The\n1\n\nSupported by grant RFBR-09-01-00191-a\n\n\f2\nasymptotic formulas provide mainly a qualitative picture. In the present paper, we show\nthat, being supplemented by some computations, the asymptotics can tell a useful quantitative information as well. Though the paper continues the studies in [1], nevertheless it is\npractically self-contained; let us explain its goal in detail.\nThe asymptotic formulas in [1] include several unknown constant coefficients, which\ncan be found by solving some boundary value problems independent of \u03b51 and \u03b52 . Here, in a\nmodel situation, we calculate approximately such coefficients, which enables us to take the\nasymptotics as numerical values of resonant tunneling characteristics for sufficiently small\n\u03b51 and \u03b52 . This leads to the question which \u03b51 , \u03b52 could be considered as \"sufficiently\nsmall\" ; in other words, where does the asymptotics work in a proper way? Though there\nis no universal answer for such a question, some examples give a grasp of what should be\nexpected in analogous cases. To this end we calculate (also approximately) the scattering\nmatrix and then compare the results obtained by the asymptotic and computational methods\nindependently of one another. Generally, it can be predicted that numerical calculations will\nbecome inefficient as the narrow diameters decrease and the resonant peak turns out to be\n\"too sharp\" ; however, at such a condition the asymptotics should become more reliable.\nOn the other hand, the asymptotics will give way to the numerical method as the narrow\ndiameters increase; in fact, for wide narrows the resonant tunneling would vanish by itself.\nWe observe these phenomena and show that there exists a band of the diameters, where the\nasymptotic and numerical approaches give compatible results.\nIn the present paper, we consider a 2D waveguide that is a strip with two narrows of\nthe same diameter \u03b5 (see Fig. 2). For 2D waveguides, the asymptotics of resonant tunneling\ncharacteristics (as \u03b5 \u2192 0) are published here for the first time; however, we do not prove the\nformulas in the paper. The reader could obtain the needed proofs by modifying arguments in\n[1] related to a 3D situation. Nonetheless, we analyze the structure of asymptotics in order\nto explain what constants in the asymptotic formulas have to be calculated numerically and\nhow to do that by solving some boundary value problems independent of \u03b5.\nThe paper consists of five sections. The mathematical model of the waveguide and\nstatement of the problem are given in section 2. The asymptotic formulas are presented\nin section 3. Then, in section 4, we list the constants to be calculated in the asymptotics,\ndescribe the boundary value problems needed for the purpose, and present the methods for\nsolving the problems numerically. In the same section we also describe a method we have\nused for approximate computation of the waveguide scattering matrix. Finally, section 5\nis devoted to comparing basic resonant tunneling characteristics obtained in two different\nways, asymptotic and numerical, independent of one another.\nThough in the present paper we considered only a 2D waveguide, the applicability of\nthe methods goes far beyond the above simplest model. In particular, the same approach\nwill work for comparison asymptotic and numerical analysis of resonant tunneling in 3D\nquantum waveguides.\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\nStatement of the problem\n\nTo describe the domain G(\u03b5) in R2 occupied by the waveguide, we first introduce two auxiliary domains G and \u03a9 in R2 . The domain G is the strip\nG = R \u00d7 D = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : x \u2208 R = (\u2212\u221e, +\u221e); y \u2208 D = (\u2212l/2, l/2)}.\nLet us define \u03a9. Denote by K a double cone with vertex at the origin O that contains the\nx-axis and is symmetric about the coordinate axes. The set K \u2229 S 1 , where S 1 is a unit\ncircle, consists of two simple arcs. Assume that \u03a9 contains the cone K and a neighborhood\nof its vertex; moreover, outside a large disk (centered at the origin) \u03a9 coincides with K. The\nboundary \u2202\u03a9 of \u03a9 is supposed to be smooth (see Fig. 1).\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03c9\n\nFigure 1: The set \u03a9.\nWe now turn to the waveguide G(\u03b5). Denote by \u03a9(\u03b5) the domain obtained from \u03a9 by\nthe contraction with center at O and coefficient \u03b5. In other words, (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9(\u03b5) if and only\nif (x/\u03b5, y/\u03b5) \u2208 \u03a9. Let Kj and \u03a9j (\u03b5) stand for K and \u03a9(\u03b5) shifted by the vector rj = (x0j , 0),\nj = 1, 2. We assume that |x01 \u2212 x02 | is sufficiently large so the distance from \u2202K1 \u2229 \u2202K2 to G\nis positive. We put\nG(\u03b5) = G \u2229 \u03a91 (\u03b5) \u2229 \u03a92 (\u03b5)\n(see Fig. 2). The wave function of a free electron of energy k 2 satisfies the boundary value\nproblem\n\u2206u(x, y) + k 2 u(x, y) = 0,\nu(x, y) = 0,\n\n(x, y) \u2208 G(\u03b5),\n(x, y) \u2208 \u2202G(\u03b5).\n\n(2.1)\n\nMoreover, u is subject to radiation conditions at infinity.

Then the scattering matrix is of size 2 \u00d7 2.

To this end we introduce \"limit\" boundary value problems independent of\nthe parameter \u03b5. Put G(0) = G \u2229 K1 \u2229 K2 (Fig. 3); thus, G(0) consists of the three parts\nG1 , G2 , and G3 , where G1 and G3 are infinite domains while G2 is a bounded resonator.\n\nG2\n\nG1\nO\n1\n\nG\n3\n\nO\n2\n\nFigure 3: The set G(0).\nThe problems\n\u2206v(x, y) + k 2 v(x, y) = 0,\nv(x, y) = 0,\n\n(x, y) \u2208 Gj ,\n(x, y) \u2208 \u2202Gj ,\n\n(3.1)\n\n\f6\nwhere j = 1, 2, 3 and \u2202Gj is the boundary of Gj , are called the first kind limit problems.\nSolutions v1 and v3 are subject to some radiation conditions at infinity and all three functions\nv1 , v2 , v3 satisfy some conditions at the corner points. All of the conditions will be formulated\nas required.\nLet us turn to the domains \u03a91 and \u03a92 (see Fig. 1). Problems of the form\n\u2206w(\u03bej , \u03b7j ) = F (\u03bej , \u03b7j )\nw(\u03bej , \u03b7j ) = 0\n\nin \u03a9j ,\non \u2202\u03a9j ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nare called the second kind limit problems. We seek solutions of the problems satisfying\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22123\u03c0/\u03c9j\nw(\u03bej , \u03b7j ) = O \u03c1j\nas \u03c1j \u2192 \u221e;\n\nhere (\u03bej , \u03b7j ) are rectangular coordinates with origin at the vertex Oj of Kj , \u03c1j being the\ndistance from (\u03bej , \u03b7j ) to Oj and \u03c9j the opening of Kj , j = 1, 2.\nIn the waveguide G(\u03b5), we consider the scattering of the wave U(x, y) = ei\u03bd1 x \u03a81 (y)\nincoming from \u2212\u221e (see (2.4)). The asymptotics of the wave function is the main technical\nresult. Although rather cumbersome, it will lead to much more explicit characteristics of the\nprocess. The wave function admits the representation\nu(x, y; \u03b5) = \u03c71, \u03b5 (x, y)v1 (x, y; \u03b5) +\n+\u0398(r1 )w1 (\u03b5\u22121x1 , \u03b5\u22121 y1 ; \u03b5) + \u03c72, \u03b5 (x, y)v2 (x, y; \u03b5) +\n+\u0398(r2 )w2 (\u03b5\u22121x2 , \u03b5\u22121 y2 ; \u03b5) + \u03c73, \u03b5 (x, y)v3 (x, y; \u03b5) + R(x, y; \u03b5).\n\n(3.3)\n\nLet us explain the notation and the structure of this formula. When composing the formula,\nwe first describe the behavior of the wave function to the right of the narrows, where the\nwave function can be approximated by a solution v3 of the problem (3.1) in G3 . The solution\nis subject to the radiation condition\nv3 (x, y; \u03b5) \u223c s12 (\u03b5)ei\u03bd1 x \u03a81 (y)\n\nas x \u2192 +\u221e,\n\n(3.4)\n\nthe element s12 (\u03b5) of scattering matrix being yet unknown. Problem (3.1) does not contain\n\u03b5, nevertheless v3 depends on the parameter because of s12 (\u03b5). By \u03c73, \u03b5 we denote a cut-off\nfunction defined by\n\u03c73, \u03b5 (x, y) = (1 \u2212 \u0398(r2 /\u03b5)) 1G3 (x, y),\np\nwhere r2 = x22 + y22 and (x2 , y2 ) are the coordinates of a point (x, y) in the system obtained\nby shifting the origin to the point O2 ; 1G3 is the indicator of G3 (equal to 1 in G3 and to\n0 outside G3 ); \u0398(\u03c1) is a smooth non-negative function on the half-axis 0 6 \u03c1 < +\u221e that\nequals 1 as 0 6 \u03c1 6 \u03b4 and vanishes as \u03c1 > 2\u03b4 (\u03b4 being a fixed small positive number). Thus\n\u03c73,\u03b5 is defined on the whole waveguide G(\u03b5) as well as the function \u03c73, \u03b5 v3 in (3.3).\nBeing substituted to (2.1), the function \u03c73, \u03b5 v3 gives a discrepancy in the right-hand\nside of the Helmholtz equation; the discrepancy is supported near the second narrow (to the\nright of it). We compensate the principal part of the discrepancy by means of the second\nkind limit problem in the domain \u03a92 . Namely, the discrepancy is rewritten into coordinates\n(\u03be2 , \u03b72 ) in \u03a92 and is taken as a right-hand side for the Laplace equation. The solution w2 of\n\n\f7\nthe corresponding problem (3.2) has to be rewritten into coordinates (x2 , y2 ) and multiplied\nby a cut-off function. As a result, there arises the term \u0398(r2 )w2 (\u03b5\u22121 x2 , \u03b5\u22121 y2 ; \u03b5) in (3.3).\nNow we substitute the sum of two obtained terms into (2.1). The principal part of\nthe corresponding discrepancy is supported in G2 near the second narrow. We compensate\nit by solving the problem (3.1) in G2 and obtain the term \u03c72, \u03b5 (x, y)v2(x, y; \u03b5) with\n\u0001\n\u03c72, \u03b5 (x, y) = 1 \u2212 \u0398(\u03b5\u22121r1 ) \u2212 \u0398(\u03b5\u22121 r2 ) 1G2 (x, y).\n\nThen in a similar way there arise\n\n\u0398(r1 )w1 (\u03b5\u22121 x1 , \u03b5\u22121y1 ; \u03b5) and \u03c71, \u03b51 (x, y)v1 (x, y; \u03b5).\nAt the last step, we find the function v1 that satisfies both the limit problem (3.1) in G1 and\nthe radiation condition\nv1 (x, y; \u03b5) \u223c s12 (\u03b5)\u03b1(\u03b5)ei\u03bd1x \u03a81 (y) + s12 (\u03b5)\u03b2(\u03b5)e\u2212i\u03bd1x \u03a81 (y)\nas x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2 and the entries s11 , s12 of the scattering matrix turn out\nto be uniquely determined by a relation between \u03b1 and \u03b2 that assures compensation of the\nprincipal part of the discrepancy arising in the problem in G1 , and by requirements\ns12 (\u03b5)\u03b1(\u03b5) = 1,\n\ns12 (\u03b5)\u03b2(\u03b5) = s11 (\u03b5).\n\nThe remainder R(x, y; \u03b5) is small in comparison with the principal part of (3.3) as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nWe specify (3.3) provided k 2 varies in an interval containing a unique simple eigenvalue\nk02 of the problem (3.1) in G2 .\n1.

Since\nthe asymptotics (3.5) can be differentiated, wr \u2212 W satisfies (4.3) with g = O(R\u2212(3\u03c0/\u03c9)\u22121 ).\nAccording to (4.4),\n\nkwr \u2212 W ; L2 (\u0393R )k 6 c\n\n\u03c9R \u2212(3\u03c0/\u03c9)\u22121\nR\n= c\u2032 R\u22123\u03c0/\u03c9\n\u03c0\n\nas R \u2192 +\u221e. We find W with FEM and take\n\u03b2=\n\nW (\u2212R, 0) \u03c0/\u03c9 \u221a\nR\n= \u03c0W (\u2212R, 0)R\u03c0/\u03c9 .\n\u03a6(0)\n\n\f11\nObviously, k(wr \u2212 R\u03c0/\u03c9 \u03a6(\u03c6)) \u2212 (W \u2212 R\u03c0/\u03c9 \u03a6(\u03c6)); L2 (\u0393R )k 6 c\u2032 R\u22123\u03c0/\u03c9 , therefore we put\n\u03b1=\n\nW (R, 0) \u2212 R\u03c0/\u03c9 \u03a6(0) \u03c0/\u03c9 \u221a\nR\n= \u03c0W (R, 0)R\u03c0/\u03c9 \u2212 R2\u03c0/\u03c9 .\n\u03a6(0)\n\nFinally, we outline the method of calculating the scattering matrix. Introduce the\nnotation\nG(\u03b5, R) = G(\u03b5) \u2229 {(x, y) : \u2212R < x < d + R},\n\u0393R\n\u0393R\n1 = \u2202G(\u03b5, R) \u2229 {(x, y) : x = \u2212R},\n2 = \u2202G(\u03b5, R) \u2229 {(x, y) : x = d + R}\nfor large R. We search the row (sm1 , . . . , sm,2M ) of the scattering matrix s = s(k) defined\nby (2.3), m = 1, . . . , M. As approximation to the row we take the minimizer of a quadratic\nfunctional. To construct such a functional we consider the problem\n\u2206XmR + k 2 XmR = 0 in G(\u03b5, R),\nR\nXmR = 0 on \u2202G(\u03b5, R) \\ (\u0393R\n1 \u222a \u03932 ),\nM\nX\nR\n\u2212i\u03bdm R\n(\u2202n + i\u03b6)Xm = i(\u2212\u03bdm + \u03b6)e\n\u03a8m (y) +\naj i(\u03bdj + \u03b6)ei\u03bdj R \u03a8j (y) on \u0393R\n1,\nj=1\n\n(\u2202n + i\u03b6)XmR =\n\nM\nX\n\naM +j i(\u03bdj + \u03b6)ei\u03bdj (d+R) \u03a8j (y) on \u0393R\n2,\n\n(4.5)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b6 \u2208 R \\ {0} is an arbitrary fixed number, and a1 , . . . , aM are complex numbers. The\nsolution um to the homogeneous problem (2.1) satisfies the first two equations (4.5). The\nasymptotics (2.3) can be differentiated so um satisfies the last two equations in (4.5) up to\nan exponentially small discrepancy. As approximation for the row (sm1 , . . . , sm,2M ) we take\nthe minimizer a0 (R) = (a01 (R), . . . , a02M (R)) of the functional\nXM\n2\nR\naj ei\u03bdj R \u03a8j ; L2 (\u0393R\nJm\n(a1 , . . . , a2M ) = kXmR \u2212 e\u2212i\u03bdm R \u03a8m \u2212\n1 )k\nj=1\nXM\n2\naM +j ei\u03bdj (d+R) \u03a8j ; L2 (\u0393R\n(4.6)\n+ kXmR \u2212\n2 )k ,\nj=1\n\nwhere XmR is a solution to problem (4.5).

The functional (4.6) can be written in the form\n\nR\nR\nR\nJm\n(a, k) = haE R (k), ai + 2Re hFm\n(k), ai + Gm\n(k),\nR\nwhere Fm\nis the m-th row of the matrix F R and h*, *i is the inner product on CM . The\nR\nminimizer a0 = a0 (R, k) (a row) satisfies a0 E R + Fm\n= 0. Recall that we are searching the\nm-th row of the scattering matrix as m = 1, . . . , M. Along the same arguments one can\nprove that the found minimizer for m = M + 1, . . . , 2M serves as approximation to the m-th\nrow of the scattering matrix. Therefore, as approximation sR (k) for the scattering matrix\ns(k) we take a solution to the equation sR E R + F R = 0.\nWhen M = 1, i.e. k 2 is between the first and the second thresholds, we take \u03b6 = \u2212\u03bd1 .\nThen v1\u2212 = v2\u2212 = 0, E R = (1/\u03bd1 )Id, and sR = \u2212\u03bd1 F R .\n\n5\n\nComparison of asymptotic and numerical results\n\n2\n2\nLet us compare the asymptotics kres,a\n(\u03b5) of resonant energy kres\n(\u03b5) and the approximate\n2\nvalue kres,n(\u03b5) obtained by numerical method.

For \u03b5 < 0.1 the numerical\nmethod is ill-conditioned.\nThe difference between the asymptotic and numerical values is more significant for\nlarger \u03b5 because the asymptotics becomes not reliable.

The difference between the peaks is quantitatively depicted in Fig. 6. Moreover, it\nturns out that the ratio of the width \u2206n (h, \u03b5) of numerical peak at height h to \u2206a (h, \u03b5) of\nasymptotic peak is independent of h. The ratio as function in \u03b5 is displayed in Fig. 7.\nNote that for \u03b5 = 0.1, i.e., at the left end of the band where the numerical and\nasymptotic results can be compared, the disparity of the results is more significant for the\nwidth of resonant peak than that for the resonant energy.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
