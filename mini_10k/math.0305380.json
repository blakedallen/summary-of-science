In order to prove the existence of an invariant integral, operator algebras are associated to Oq (Matn,1 ) which allow an interpretation as \"rapidly decreasing\" functions and as functions with compact support on the quantum (n, 1)matrix ball. It is shown that the invariant integral is given by a generalization of\nthe quantum trace. If an operator representation of a first order differential calculus over the quantum space is known, then it can be extended to the operator\nalgebras of integrable functions.

Some topological aspects concerning Hilbert space\nrepresentations are discussed.\nKeywords: invariant integration, quantum groups, operator algebras.\nMSC-class: 17B37, 47L60, 81R50\n\n1 Introduction\nThe development of quantum mechanics at the beginning of the past century resulted\nin the discovery that nuclear physics is governed by non-commutative quantities. Recently, there have been made various suggestions that spacetime may be described by\nnon-commutative structures at Planck scale. Within this approach, quantum groups\nmight play a fundamental role. They can be viewed as q-deformations of a classical\nLie group or Lie algebra and allow thus an interpretation as generalized symmetries.\nAt the present stage, the theory is still in the beginning. Before constructing physical models, one has to establish the mathematical foundations-most important, the\nmachineries of differential and integral calculus.\nIn this paper, we deal with integral calculus on non-compact quantum spaces. The\nintegration theory on compact quantum groups is well established and was mainly developed by S. L. Woronowicz [16]. He proved the existence of a unique normalized\ninvariant functional (Haar functional) on compact quantum groups. If one turns to the\nstudy of non-compact quantum groups or non-compact quantum spaces, one faces new\n1\n\n\fdifficulties which do not occur in the compact case. For instance, we do not expect that\nthere exists a normalized invariant functional on the polynomial algebra of the quantum space. The situation is analogous to the classical theory of locally compact spaces,\nwhere one can only integrate functions which vanish sufficiently rapidly at infinity.\nOur aim is to define appropriate classes of quantized integrable functions for noncompact q-deformed manifolds. The ideas are similar to those in [13], where a space\nof finite functions was associated to the the quantum disc. However, our treatment\nwill make this construction more general and will allow us to consider a wider class of\nintegrable functions. Furthermore, the invariant integral turns out to be a generalization\nof the well-known quantum trace-an observation that provides us with a rather natural\nproof of its invariance.\nStarting point of our approach will be what we call an operator expansion of the\naction. Suppose we are given a Hopf *-algebra U and a U-module *-algebra X with\naction \u22b2. Let \u03c0 : X \u2192 L+ (D) be a *-representation. (Precise definitions will be given\nbelow.) If for any Z \u2208 U there exists a finite number of operators Li , Ri \u2208 L+ (D)\nsuch that\nX\nLi \u03c0(x)Ri , x \u2208 X ,\n(1)\n\u03c0(Z \u22b2x) =\ni\n\nthen we say that we have an operator expansion of the action. Obviously, it is sufficient\nto know the operators Li , Ri for the generators of U. The operators Li , Ri are not\nunique as it can be seen by replacing Li and Ri by (\u2212Li ) and (\u2212Ri ).\nLet us briefly outline our method of introducing an invariant integration theory\non non-compact quantum spaces. Assume that g is a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra. Let Uq (g) denote the corresponding quantized universal enveloping\nalgebra. With the adjoint action adq (X)(Y ) := X(1) Y S(X(2) ), Uq (g) becomes a\nUq (g)-module (*-)algebra. It is a well-known fact that, for finite dimensional represen\u22121\ntations \u03c1 of Uq (g), the quantum trace formula Tr q (X) := Tr \u03c1(XK2\u03c9\n), X \u2208 Uq (g),\ndefines an adq -invariant linear functional on Uq (g). Here, the element K2\u03c9 \u2208 Uq (g) is\n\u22121\ntaken such that K2\u03c9\nXK2\u03c9 = S 2 (X).\nNow consider a Uq (g)-module *-algebra X and a *-representation \u03c0 : X \u2192\nL+ (D). In our examples, the operator expansion (1) of the Uq (g)-action on X will\nresemble the adjoint action. Furthermore, it can be extended to the *-algebra L+ (D)\nturning L+ (D) into a Uq (g)-module *-algebra. The quantum trace formula suggests\nthat we can try to define an invariant integral by replacing K2\u03c9 by the operator that realizes the operator expansion of K2\u03c9 and taking the trace on the Hilbert space H = D\u0304.\nSince we deal with unbounded operators, this can only be done for an appropriate class\nof operators, say B.\nFirst of all, the generalized quantum trace should be well defined. Next, we wish\nthat B is a Uq (g)-module *-algebra. This means that B should be stable under the action\ndefined by the operator expansion. If we choose B such that the closures of its elements\nare of trace class and that multiplying the elements of B by any operator appearing in\nthe operator expansion yields an element of B, then B is certainly stable under the\naction of Uq (g) on L+ (D) and the generalized quantum trace is well defined on B.\nOur intention is to interpret B as the rapidly decreasing functions on a q-deformed\nmanifold. For this reason, we suppose additionally that B is stable under multiplication\nby elements of X .\n2\n\n\fClearly, the assumptions on B are satisfied by the *-algebra of finite rank operators\nF in L+ (D). The elements of F are considered as functions with finite support on the\nq-deformed manifold.\nIf we think of Uq (g) as generalized differential operators, then we can think of\nB and F as infinitely differentiable functions since both algebras are stable under the\naction of Uq (g).\nThe algebras B and F were mainly introduced in order to develop an invariant\nintegration theory on q-deformed manifolds. Nevertheless, our approach also allows\nto include differential calculi. By means of an operator representation of a first order\ndifferential calculus over X , one can build a differential calculus over the operator\nalgebras B and F. In this case, we view the differential calculus over B and F as an\nextension of the differential calculus over X .\nThere is another notable feature of our approach. The algebras X (more exactly,\n\u03c0(X )), B, and F are subalgebras of L+ (D). In particular, they are subspaces of the\ntopological space L(D, D+ ). Therefore we can view this algebras as topological\nspaces in a rather natural way. As a consequence, it makes sense to discuss topological\nconcepts such as continuity, density, etc.\nIn this paper, we treat the quantum (n, 1)-matrix ball Oq (Matn,1 ) as a Uq (sun,1 )module *-algebra [12]. Since our approach to invariant integration theory is based on\nHilbert space representations, we shall also study *-representations of Oq (Matn,1 ).\nWhen n = 1, Oq (Matn,1 ) is referred to as quantum disc Oq (U) [13]. As the algebraic\nrelations and the *-representations of Oq (U) are comparatively simple, it will serve as\na guiding example in order to motivate and illustrate our ideas and, therefore, we shall\ndiscuss it in a greater detail.\n\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Algebraic preliminaries\nThroughout this paper, q stands for a real number such that 0 < q < 1, and we abbreviate \u03bb = q \u2212 q \u22121 .\nLet U be a Hopf algebra. The comultiplication, the counit, and the antipode of a\nHopf algebra are denoted by \u2206, \u03b5, and S, respectively. For the comultiplication \u2206,\nwe employ the Sweedler notation: \u2206(x) = x(1) \u2297 x(2) . The main objects of our\ninvestigation are U-module algebras. An algebra X is called a left U-module algebra\nif X is a left U-module with action \u22b2 satisfying\nf \u22b2(xy) = (f(1) \u22b2x)(f(2) \u22b2y),\n\nx, y \u2208 X , f \u2208 U.\n\n(2)\n\nFor an algebra X with unit 1, we additionally require\nf \u22b21 = \u03b5(f )1,\n\nf \u2208 U.\n\n(3)\n\nLet X be a *-algebra and U a Hopf *-algebra.

If I is an at most\ncountable index set and H = \u2295i\u2208I Hi , where Hi = K for all i \u2208 I, we denote by \u03b7i\nthe vector of H which has the element \u03b7 \u2208 K as its i-th component and zero otherwise.\nIt is understood that \u03b7i = 0 whenever i \u2208\n/ I.\nIf T is an (unbounded) operator on H, we denote by D(T ), \u03c3(T ), T\u0304 , and T \u2217\nthe domain, the spectrum, the closure, and the adjoint of T , respectively. A self-adjoint\noperator A is called strictly positive if A \u2265 0 and ker A = {0}. We write \u03c3(A) \u2291 (a, b]\nif \u03c3(A)\u2286[a, b] and a is not an eigenvalue of A. By definition, two self-adjoint operators\nstrongly commute if their spectral projections mutually commute.\nLet D be a dense subspace of H. Then the vector space\nL+ (D) := { x \u2208 End(D) ; D \u2282 D(x\u2217 ), x\u2217 D \u2282 D }\nis a unital *-algebra of closeable operators with the involution x 7\u2192 x+ := x\u2217 \u2308D\nand the operator product as its multiplication. Since it should cause no confusion, we\nshall continue to write x\u2217 in place of x+ . Unital *-subalgebras of L+ (D) are called\nO*-algebras.\nTwo *-subalgebras of L+ (D) which are not O*-algebras will be of particular interest: The *-algebra of all finite rank operators\nF(D) := { x \u2208 L+ (D) ; x\u0304 is bounded, dim(x\u0304H) < \u221e, x\u0304H \u2282 D, x\u0304\u2217 H \u2282 D } (17)\nand, given an O*-algebra A,\nB1 (A) := { t \u2208 L+ (D) ; t\u0304H \u2282 D, t\u0304\u2217 H \u2282 D, atb is of trace class for all a, b \u2208 A }.\n(18)\nIt follows from [8, Lemma 5.1.4] that B1 (A) is a *-subalgebra of L+ (D). Obviously,\nwe have F(D) \u2282 B1 (A)P\nand 1 \u2208\n/ B1 (A) if dim(H) = \u221e. An operator A \u2208 F(D)\nn\ncan be written as A =\n\u03b1\nei \u2297 fi , where n \u2208 N, \u03b1i \u2208 C, fi , ei \u2208 D, and\ni\ni=1\n(ei \u2297 fi )(x) := fi (x)ei for x \u2208 D.\nAssume that A is an O*-algebra on a dense domain DA . A natural choice for a\ntopology on DA is the graph topology tA generated by the family of semi-norms\n{ || * ||a }a\u2208A ,\n\n||\u03c6||a := ||a\u03c6||,\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 DA .\n\n(19)\n\nA is called closed if the locally convex space DA is complete. The closure \u0100 of A is\ndefined by\nD\u0100 := \u2229a\u2208A D(\u0101), \u0100 := { \u0101\u2308D\u0100 ; a \u2208 A }.\n(20)\n5\n\n\fBy [8, Lemma 2.2.9], D\u0100 is complete.\nWe say that A is a commutatively dominated O*-algebra on the Frechet domain DA\nif it satisfies the following assumptions (which are consequences from the definitions\ngiven in [8]). There exist a self-adjoint operator A on H and a sequence of Borel\nmeasurable real-valued functions rn , n \u2208 N, such that 1 \u2264 r1 (t), rn (t)2 \u2264 rn+1 (t),\nrn (A)\u2308DA \u2208 A, and DA = \u2229n\u2208N D(rn (A)).\n\u2032\nLet DA\ndenote the strong dual of the locally convex space DA . Then the conjugate\n+\n\u2032\nspace DA is the topological space DA\nwith the addition defined as before and the\n+\n\u2032\nmultiplication replaced by \u03b1 * f := \u1fb1f , \u03b1 \u2208 C, f \u2208 DA\n. For f \u2208 DA\nand \u03c6 \u2208\nDA , we shall write hf, \u03c6i rather than f (\u03c6). The vector space of all continuous linear\n+\n+\n+\noperators mapping DA into DA\nis denoted by L(DA , DA\n). We assign to L(DA , DA\n)\nthe bounded topology \u03c4b generated by the system of semi-norms\n{ pM ; M \u2282 DA , bounded },\n\npM (A) := sup\u03c6,\u03c8\u2208M |hA\u03c6, \u03c8i|,\n\nA \u2208 A.\n\n+\nNotice that A \u2282 L(DA , DA\n) for any O*-algebra A. Furthermore, it is known that\n+\n+\nL (DA ) \u2282 L(DA , DA ) if DA is a Frechet space.\nBy a *-representation \u03c0 of a *-algebra A on a domain D we mean a *-homomorphism \u03c0 : A \u2192 L+ (D). For notational simplicity, we usually suppress the representation and write x instead of \u03c0(x) when no confusion can arise. If each decomposition\n\u03c0 = \u03c01 \u2295 \u03c02 of \u03c0 as direct sum of *-representations \u03c01 and \u03c02 implies that \u03c01 = 0 or\n\u03c02 = 0, then \u03c0 is said to be irreducible.\nGiven a *-representation \u03c0, it follows from [8, Proposition 8.1.12] that the mapping\n\n\u03c0\u0304 : A \u2192 L+ (D(\u03c0\u0304)),\n\n\u03c0\u0304(a) := \u03c0(a)\u2308D(\u03c0\u0304),\n\ndefines a *-representation on D(\u03c0\u0304) := \u2229a\u2208A D(\u03c0(a)). \u03c0\u0304 is called the closure of \u03c0 and\n\u03c0 is said to be closed if \u03c0\u0304 = \u03c0.\nIf we consider *-representations of *-algebras, we shall restrict ourself to representations which are in a certain sense \"well behaved\". This means that we shall impose\nsome regularity conditions on the (in general) unbounded operators under consideration. Such *-representations will be called admissible. The requirements will strongly\ndepend on the situation. Therefore there is no general definition of \"admissible\". For\nfurther discussion on \"well behaved\" representations, see [10, 2, 1].\nSuppose that X is a *-algebra and \u03c0 : X \u2192 L+ (D) a *-representation. Each\nsymmetric operator C \u2208 L+ (D) gives rise to a first order differential *-calculus\n(\u0393\u03c0,C , d\u03c0,C ) over X defined by\n\u0393\u03c0,C := Lin{ \u03c0(x)(C\u03c0(y) \u2212 \u03c0(y)C)\u03c0(z) ; x, y, z \u2208 X } and\nd\u03c0,C : X \u2192 \u0393\u03c0,C , d\u03c0,C (x) := i(C\u03c0(x) \u2212 \u03c0(x)C), x \u2208 X ,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nwhere i denotes the imaginary unit (see [9]). Let (\u0393, d) be a first order differential\n*-calculus over X . Then (\u0393\u03c0,C , d\u03c0,C ) is called a commutator representation of (\u0393, d),\nif there exits a linear mapping \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393\u03c0,C such that \u03c1(x*dy*z) = \u03c0(x)d\u03c0,C (y)\u03c0(z)\nand \u03c1(\u03b3 \u2217 ) = \u03c1(\u03b3)\u2217 for all x, y, z \u2208 X , \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393.\nWe close this subsection by stating three auxiliary lemmas.\n\n6\n\n\fLemma 2.1 Let A be a self-adjoint operator and let w be an unitary operator on a\nHilbert space H such that\nqwA \u2286 Aw.\n(23)\ni. The spectral projections of A corresponding to (\u2212\u221e, 0), {0}, and (0, \u221e) commute with w.\nii. Suppose additionally that A is strictly positive. Then there exists a self-adjoint\noperator A0 on a Hilbert space H0 with \u03c3(A0 ) \u2291 (q, 1] such that, up to unitary\nequivalence, H = \u2295\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e Hn , Hn = H0 , and\nA\u03b7n = q n A0 \u03b7n ,\n\nw\u03b7n = \u03b7n+1 ,\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u2208 H0 and n \u2208 Z.\nProof. (i): Let e(\u03bc) denote the spectral projections of A. Since w is unitary, (23)\nimplies that A = qwAw\u2217 and hence e(q\u03bc) = we(\u03bc)w\u2217 . This proves (i).\n(ii): Let Hn := e((q n+1 , q n ])H and An := A\u2308Hn , n \u2208 Z. Since A is strictly positive,\nn+1 n\nH = \u2295\u221e\n, q ]) = we((q n , q n\u22121 ])w\u2217 yields wHn = Hn+1 . Up\nn=\u2212\u221e Hn . Now e((q\nto unitary equivalence, we can assume that Hn = H0 and w\u03b7n = \u03b7n+1 for \u03b7 \u2208 H0 .\nMoreover, A\u03b7n = q n wn Awn\u2217 \u03b7n = q n wn A0 \u03b70 = q n A0 \u03b7n .\n\u2737\nLemma 2.2 Let A be a self-adjoint operator and let w be a linear isometry on a\nHilbert space H such that\nswA \u2286 Aw\n(24)\nfor some fixed positive real number s 6= 1. Suppose that A has an eigenvalue \u03bb such\nthat the eigenspace H0 := ker (A \u2212 \u03bb) coincides with ker w\u2217 . Then the eigenspace\nHn := ker (A \u2212 sn \u03bb) coincides with wn H0 for each n \u2208 N.\nProof. Taking adjoints in (24) gives s\u22121 w\u2217 A \u2286 Aw\u2217 . Let n \u2208 N0 , \u03c6 \u2208 Hn , and\n\u03c8 \u2208 Hn+1 . Then Aw\u03c6 = swA\u03c6 = sn+1 \u03bbw\u03c6 and Aw\u2217 \u03c8 = s\u22121 w\u2217 A\u03c8 = sn \u03bbw\u2217 \u03c8.\nHence wHn \u2282 Hn+1 and w\u2217 Hn+1 \u2282 Hn . Since Hn+1 \u22a5 H0 , we have w w\u2217 \u03c8 = \u03c8.\nThis together with w\u2217 w = 1 implies that w\u2308Hn is a bijective mapping from Hn onto\nHn+1 with inverse w\u2217 \u2308Hn+1 .\n\u2737\nLemma 2.3 Let \u01eb \u2208 {\u00b11}. Assume that x is a closed, densely defined operator on a\nHilbert space H. Then we have D(xx\u2217 ) = D(x\u2217 x) and the relation\nxx\u2217 \u2212 q 2 x\u2217 x = \u01eb(1 \u2212 q 2 )\n\n(25)\n\nholds if and only if x is unitarily equivalent to an orthogonal direct sum of operators\nof the following form.\n\u01eb = 1:\n(I) x\u03b7n = (1 \u2212 q 2n )1/2 \u03b7n\u22121 on the Hilbert space H = \u2295\u221e\nn=0 Hn , Hn = H0 .\n(II)A x\u03b7n = (1 + q 2n A)1/2 \u03b7n\u22121 on H = \u2295\u221e\nn=\u2212\u221e Hn , Hn = H0 , where A is\na self-adjoint operator on H0 such that \u03c3(A) \u2291 (q 2 , 1].\n7\n\n\f(III)u x = u, where u is a unitary operator on H.\n\u01eb = \u22121:\nx\u03b7n = (q \u22122n \u2212 1)1/2 \u03b7n+1 on the Hilbert space H = \u2295\u221e\nn=1 Hn , Hn = H1 .\nProof. Direct calculations show that the operators described in Lemma 2.3 satisfy (25).\nSuppose now we are given an operator x satisfying the assumptions of the lemma. Let\ne(\u03bc) denote the spectral projections of the self-adjoint operator Q = \u01eb \u2212 x\u2217 x. For\n\u03c6 \u2208 D(Q2 ) = D((x\u2217 x)2 ), it follows from (25) that\nQx\u2217 \u03c6 = x\u2217 (\u01eb \u2212 xx\u2217 )\u03c6 = x\u2217 (\u01eb \u2212 q 2 x\u2217 x \u2212 \u01eb(1 \u2212 q 2 ))\u03c6 = q 2 x\u2217 Q\u03c6,\n\u2217\n\n2 \u2217\n\n2\n\n2\n\nxQ\u03c6 = (\u01eb \u2212 xx )x\u03c6 = (\u01eb \u2212 q x x \u2212 \u01eb(1 \u2212 q ))x\u03c6 = q Qx\u03c6.\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nThe cases \u01eb = 1 and \u01eb = \u22121 will be analyzed separately.\n\u01eb = 1: Let x\u2217 = ua be the polar decomposition of x\u2217 . Note that\na2 = xx\u2217 = 1 \u2212 q 2 + q 2 x\u2217 x = 1 \u2212 q 2 Q \u2265 1 \u2212 q 2 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhich implies, in particular, that ker a = ker u = 0, so u is an isometry. Inserting\n\u03c6 = a\u22121 \u03c8 in (26), where \u03c8 \u2208 D(Q3/2 ), one obtains Qu\u03c8 = q 2 uaQa\u22121 \u03c8 = q 2 uQ\u03c8.\nSince D(Q3/2 ) is a core for Q, it follows that q 2 uQ \u2286 Qu. By taking adjoints,\none also gets u\u2217 Q \u2286 q 2 Qu\u2217 . Furthermore, \u03c6 \u2208 ker x = ker x\u2217 x = ker u\u2217 if and\nonly if (Q \u2212 1)\u03c6 = 0. If ker u\u2217 6= {0}, Lemma 2.2 implies that K := \u2295\u221e\nn=0 Hn ,\nwhere Hn = ker (Q \u2212 q 2n ), is a reducing subspace for u and Q. Moreover, x\u2308K =\n(1 \u2212 q 2 Q)1/2 u\u2217 \u2308K is unitarily equivalent to an operator of the form (I).\nIt suffices now to prove the assertion under the additional assumption that ker u\u2217 =\n{0}. By Lemma 2.1(i), we can treat the cases where Q is strictly positive, zero, or\nstrictly negative separately.\nIf Q were strictly positive , then it would be unbounded by Lemma 2.1(ii), which\ncontradicts (28). Hence we can discard this case. If Q = 0, then x = u\u2217 is unitarily\nequivalent to an operator of the form (III)u . When Q is strictly negative, Lemma\n2.1(ii) applied to the relation q 2 u(\u2212Q) \u2286 (\u2212Q)u shows that x = (1 \u2212 q 2 Q)1/2 u\u2217 is\nunitarily equivalent to an operator of the form (II)A .\n\u01eb = \u22121: In this case, we use the polar decomposition x = vb of x. From\nb2 = x\u2217 x = \u22121 \u2212 Q = q \u22122 (xx\u2217 + 1 \u2212 q 2 ) \u2265 q \u22122 \u2212 1,\n\n(29)\n\nit follows that ker b = ker v = {0} so that v is an isometry. Using (27) and arguing as\nabove, one obtains q \u22122 vQ \u2286 Qv and q 2 v \u2217 Q \u2286 Qv \u2217 . Note that, in the present case,\nQ \u2264 \u2212q \u22122 by (29). Therefore ker v \u2217 6= {0} since otherwise Lemma 2.1 would imply\nthat 0 belongs to the spectrum of Q. Now \u03c6 \u2208 ker v \u2217 = ker x\u2217 = ker xx\u2217 if and only\nif Q\u03c6 = (\u22121\u2212x\u2217x)\u03c6 = (\u22121\u2212q \u22122(1\u2212q 2 ))\u03c6 = \u2212q \u22122 \u03c6. From Lemma 2.2, it follows\n\u22122n\nthat K := \u2295\u221e\n), is a reducing subspace for v and\nn=1 Hn , where Hn = ker (Q + q\n1/2\nQ. In particular, x\u2308K = v(\u22121 \u2212 Q) \u2308K is unitarily equivalent to an operator of the\nform stated in the lemma. Finally, we conclude that H = K since the restriction of v \u2217\nto a nonzero orthogonal complement of K would be injective, which is impossible as\nnoted before.\n\u2737\n8\n\n\fRemark. For \u01eb = 1, a characterization of irreducible representations of (25) can\nbe found in [7] as a special case of the results therein. For \u01eb = \u22121, the irreducible\nrepresentations of (25) were obtained in [3] by assuming in the proof that x\u2217 x has\neigenvectors.\n\n3 Quantum disc\n3.1 Invariant integration on the quantum disc\nThe quantum disc Oq (U) is defined as the *-algebra generated by z and z \u2217 with relation\nz \u2217 z \u2212 q 2 zz \u2217 = 1 \u2212 q 2 .\nn \u2217m\n\nBy (30), it is obvious that Oq (U) = Lin{z z\n\n(30)\n\n; n, m \u2208 N}.

In particular, each element\nf \u2208 Oq (U) can be written as\nf=\n\nN\nX\n\nz n pn (y) +\n\nn=0\n\nM\nX\n\np\u2212n (y)z \u2217n ,\n\nN, M \u2208 N,\n\n(34)\n\nn=1\n\nwith polynomials pn in y.\nThe left action \u22b2 which turns Oq (U) into a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra can be\nfound in [13, 14] or [4]. On generators, it takes the form\nK \u00b11 \u22b2z = q \u00b12 z,\nK \u00b1 \u22b2z \u2217 = q \u22132 z \u2217 ,\n\nE \u22b2z = \u2212q 1/2 z 2 ,\nE \u22b2z \u2217 = q \u22123/2 ,\n\nF \u22b2z = q 1/2 ,\n\n(35)\n\nF \u22b2z \u2217 = \u2212q 5/2 z \u22172 .\n\n(36)\n\nRemind our notational conventions regarding representations. For instance, if \u03c0 :\nOq (U) \u2192 L+ (D) is a representation, we write f instead of \u03c0(f ) and X \u22b2f in instead\nof \u03c0(X \u22b2f ), where f \u2208 Oq (U), X \u2208 Uq (su1,1 ). The key observation of this subsection\nis the following simple operator expansion.\nLemma 3.1 Let \u03c0 : Oq (U) \u2192 L+ (D) be a *-representation of Oq (U) such that y \u22121\nbelongs to L+ (D). Set A := q \u22121/2 \u03bb\u22121 z and B := \u2212y \u22121 A\u2217 .

The same formulas\napplied to f \u2208 L+ (D) turn the O\u2217 -algebra L+ (D) into a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra.\nProof. We take Equations (37)\u2013(39) as definition and show that the action \u22b2 defined\nin this way turns L+ (D) into a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra. To verify that \u22b2 is well\ndefined, we use the commutation relations\nyA = q 2 Ay,\n\nyB = q \u22122 By,\n\nAB \u2212 BA = \u2212\u03bb\u22121 y \u22121\n\n(40)\n\nwhich are easily obtained by applying (30) and (32). Let f \u2208 L+ (D). It follows that\nKE \u22b2f = y(Af \u2212 yf y \u22121 A)y \u22121 = q 2 (Ayf y \u22121 \u2212 y 2 f y \u22122 A) = q 2 EK \u22b2f\nand\n(EF \u2212 F E)\u22b2f\n\n= ABf y + yf BA \u2212 BAf y \u2212 yf AB\n= (AB \u2212 BA)f y \u2212 yf (AB \u2212 BA)\n= \u03bb\u22121 (yf y \u22121 \u2212 y \u22121 f y) = \u03bb\u22121 (K \u2212 K \u22121 )\u22b2f.\n\nThe other relations of (14) are treated in the same way, so we conclude that the action\nis well defined.\nWe continue by verifying (2)\u2013(4). Since the action is associative, it is sufficient to\nprove (2)\u2013(4) for the generators E, F , K, and K \u22121 . Let f, g \u2208 L+ (D). Then\nK \u00b11 \u22b2(f g) = y \u00b11 f gy \u22131 = y \u00b11 f y \u22131 y \u00b11 gy \u22131 = (K \u00b11 \u22b2f )(K \u00b11 \u22b2g).\nFurthermore,\n(E \u22b2f )g + (K \u22b2f )(E \u22b2g) =\n=\n\n(Af \u2212 yf y \u22121 A)g + yf y \u22121 (Ag \u2212 ygy \u22121 A)\nAf g \u2212 yf gy \u22121 A = E \u22b2(f g)\n\nand, analogously, (F \u22b2f )(K \u22121 \u22b2g) + f (F \u22b2g) = F \u22b2(f g).\nClearly, K \u00b11 \u22b21 = \u03b5(K \u00b11 )1, E \u22b21 = A \u2212 yy \u22121 A = 0 = \u03b5(E)1, and, similarly,\nF \u22b21 = 0 = \u03b5(F )1. Equation (4) reads for K \u00b11\n(K \u00b11 \u22b2f )\u2217 = (y \u00b11 f y \u22131 )\u2217 = y \u22131 f \u2217 y \u00b11 = K \u22131 \u22b2f \u2217 = S(K \u00b11 )\u2217 \u22b2f \u2217 ,\nand, for E, we have\n(E \u22b2f )\u2217 = f \u2217 A\u2217 \u2212A\u2217 y \u22121 f \u2217 y = \u2212f \u2217 yB+q \u22122 Bf \u2217 y = q \u22122 F \u22b2f \u2217 = S(E)\u2217 \u22b2f \u2217 (41)\nsince S(E)\u2217 = KF K \u22121 = q \u22122 F . Replacing in (41) f by q 2 f \u2217 and applying the\ninvolution gives (F \u22b2f )\u2217 = q 2 E \u22b2f \u2217 = S(F )\u2217 \u22b2f \u2217 , where we used S(F )\u2217 = q 2 E.\nSummarizing, we have shown that the action \u22b2 defined by (37)\u2013(39) equips L+ (D)\nwith the structure of a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra.\nIt remains to prove that (37)\u2013(39) define an operator expansion of the action \u22b2 given\nby (35) and (36). Since \u03c0(Oq (U)) is a *-subalgebra of the Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra\nL+ (D), it is sufficient to verify (37)\u2013(39) for the generators of Uq (su1,1 ) and Oq (U)\n10\n\n\f(see Equation (2)). From the definition of A and y, it follows by using (40) and (30)\nthat\n(42)\nK \u00b11 \u22b2z = y \u00b11 zy \u22131 = q \u00b12 z, K \u00b11 \u22b2z \u2217 = y \u00b11 z \u2217 y \u22131 = q \u22132 z \u2217 ,\nE \u22b2z = Az \u2212 yzy \u22121 A = q \u22121/2 \u03bb\u22121 (z 2 \u2212 q 2 z 2 ) = \u2212q 1/2 z 2 ,\n\n(43)\n\nE \u22b2z \u2217 = Az \u2217 \u2212 yz \u2217 y \u22121 A = q \u22125/2 \u03bb\u22121 (q 2 zz \u2217 \u2212 z \u2217 z) = q \u22123/2\n\n(44)\n\nand, similarly, F \u22b2z = q\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\nF \u22b2z \u2217\n\n= \u2212q\n\n5/2 \u22172\n\nz . This completes the proof.\n\n\u2737\n\nRecall that the left adjoint action adL (a)(b) := a(1) bS(a(2) ), a, b \u2208 Uq (su1,1 ),\nturns Uq (su1,1 ) into a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra. For the generators E, F , and K, we\nobtain adL (E)(b) = Eb\u2212KbK \u22121 E, adL (F )(b) = F bK\u2212q 2 bKF , and adL (K)(b) =\nKbK \u22121. There is an obvious formal coincidence of this formulas with (37)\u2013(39) but\nA, B, and y do not satisfy the relations of E, F , and K because the last equation of\n(40) differs from (15).\nWe mentioned that for a finite dimensional representation \u03c1 of Uq (su1,1 ) the quantum trace\nTrq a := Tr \u03c1(aK \u22121 )\ndefines an invariant integral on Uq (su1,1 ) (see [5, Proposition 7.1.14]). The proof does\nnot involve the whole set of relations of Uq (su1,1 ) but the trace property and the relation\nK \u22121 f K = S 2 (f ) for all f \u2208 Uq (su1,1 ). The last relation reads on generators as\nK \u22121 KK = K, K \u22121 EK = q \u22122 E, K \u22121 F K = q 2 F and these equations are also\nsatisfied if we replace K by y, E by A, and F by B.\nThe main result of this section, achieved in Proposition 3.2 below, is a generalization of the quantum trace formula to the operator algebras B1 (A) and F(D) from\nSubsection 2.2 by using the above observations. Notice that we cannot have a normalized invariant integral on Oq (U); if there were an invariant integral h on Oq (U)\nsatisfying h(1) = 1, then we would obtain\n1 = h(1) = q \u22121/2 h(F \u22b2z) = q \u22121/2 \u03b5(F )h(z),\n\n(45)\n\na contradiction since \u03b5(F ) = 0.\nProposition 3.2 Suppose that \u03c0 : Oq (U) \u2192 L+ (D) is a *-representation of Oq (U)\nsuch that y \u22121 \u2208 L+ (D). Let A be the O*-algebra generated by the operators z, z \u2217 ,\nand y \u22121 . Then the *-algebras F(D) and B1 (A) defined in (17) and (18), respectively,\nare Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebras, where the action is given by (37)\u2013(39). The linear\nfunctional\nh(g) := c Tr gy \u22121 , c \u2208 R,\n(46)\ndefines an invariant integral on both F(D) and B1 (A).\nProof. Obviously, by the definition of F(D) and B1 (A), we have af b \u2208 F(D) and\nagb \u2208 B1 (A) for all f \u2208 F(D), g \u2208 B1 (A), a, b \u2208 A, so both algebras are stable\nunder the action of Uq (su1,1 ). By Lemma (3.1), this action turns F(D) and B1 (A) into\nUq (su1,1 )-module *-algebras.\n11\n\n\fThe proof of the invariance of h uses the trace property Tr agb = Tr gba = Tr bag\nwhich holds for all g \u2208 B1 (A) and all a, b \u2208 A (see [8]). Since the action is associative\nand \u03b5 a homomorphism, we only have to prove the invariance of h for generators. Let\ng \u2208 B1 (A). Clearly,\nh(K \u00b11 \u22b2g) = Tr y \u00b11 gy \u22131 y \u22121 = Tr gy \u22121 = \u03b5(K \u00b11 )h(g),\nh(E \u22b2g) = Tr (Agy \u22121 \u2212 ygy \u22121 Ay \u22121 ) = Tr Agy \u22121 \u2212 Tr Agy \u22121 = 0 = \u03b5(E)h(g).\nUsing the second relation of (40), we compute\nh(F \u22b2g) = Tr (Bg \u2212 q 2 gyBy \u22121 ) = Tr gB \u2212 Tr gB = 0 = \u03b5(B)h(g).\nHence h defines an invariant integral on B1 (A). It is obvious that the restriction of h to\nF(D) gives an invariant integral on F(D).\n\u2737\nCommonly, the algebra Oq (U) is considered as the polynomial functions on the\nquantum disc. Observe that agb \u2208 B1 (A) for all g \u2208 B1 (A) and all polynomial\nfunctions a, b \u2208 Oq (U). Notice, furthermore, that the action of E and F satisfies a\n\"twisted\" Leibniz rule. If we think of Uq (su1,1 ) as an algebra of \"generalized differential operators\", then we can think of B1 (A) as the algebra of infinitely differentiable\nfunctions which vanish sufficiently rapidly at \"infinity\" and of F(D) as the infinitely\ndifferentiable functions with compact support.\n\n3.2 Topological aspects of *-representations\nThis subsection is concerned with some topological aspects of the representations of\nOq (U). The representations of Oq (U) are given by Lemma 2.3. Here we restate\nLemma 2.3 by considering only irreducible *-representations and specifying the domain on which the operators act. As we require that y \u22121 exists, we exclude the case\n(III)u in which y = 0. Let {\u03b7j }j\u2208J denote the canonical basis in the Hilbert space\nH = l2 (J), where J = N0 or J = Z.\n(I) The operators z, z \u2217 , and y act on D := Lin{ \u03b7n ; n \u2208 N0 } by\nz\u03b7n = \u03bbn+1 \u03b7n+1 ,\n\nz \u2217 \u03b7n = \u03bbn \u03b7n\u22121 ,\n\ny\u03b7n = q 2n \u03b7n .\n\n(II)\u03b1 Let \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1). The actions of z, z \u2217 , and y on D := Lin{ \u03b7n ; n \u2208 Z } are given\nby\nz\u03b7n = \u03bb\u03b1,n+1 \u03b7n+1 ,\n\nz \u2217 \u03b7n = \u03bb\u03b1,n \u03b7n\u22121 ,\n\ny\u03b7n = \u2212q 2(\u03b1+n) \u03b7n ,\n\nwhere \u03bbn = (1 \u2212 q 2n )1/2 and \u03bb\u03b1,n = (1 + q 2(\u03b1+n) )1/2 . Obviously, y \u22121 \u2208 L+ (D) in\nboth cases.\nLet A be the O*-algebra defined in Proposition 3.2. If we equip D with the graph\ntopology tA , D is not complete. The situation becomes better if we pass to the closure\nof A. Since this can always be done, there is no loss of generality in assuming A to\nbe closed, that is, DA := \u2229a\u2208A D(\u0101) (see Equation (20)). Some topological facts concerning A and L+ (DA ) are collected in the following lemma and the next proposition.\n\n12\n\n\fLemma 3.3 Suppose that we are given an irreducible *-representation of type (I) or\n(II)\u03b1 and the O*-algebra A from Proposition 3.2 is closed.\ni. A is a commutatively dominated O*-algebra on a Frechet domain.\nii. DA is nuclear, in particular, DA is a Frechet\u2013Montel space.\nProof. (i): The operator y is essentially self-adjoint on DA and so is\nT := 1 + y 2 + y \u22122 .\n\n(47)\n\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 DA . A standard argument shows that, for each polynomial p(y, y \u22121 ), there\nexist k \u2208 N such that ||p(y, y \u22121 )\u03c6|| \u2264 ||T k \u03c6||. By using (33), we get the estimates\n||z n p(y, y \u22121 )\u03c6|| \u2264 (||p\u0304(y, y \u22121 )(q 2 y; q 2 )n p(y, y \u22121 )\u03c6|| ||\u03c6||)1/2 \u2264 ||T l \u03c6||,\n\u2032\n\n||z \u2217n p(y, y \u22121 )\u03c6|| \u2264 (||p\u0304(y, y \u22121 )(y; q \u22122 )n p(y, y \u22121 )\u03c6|| ||\u03c6||)1/2 \u2264 ||T l \u03c6||\nfor some l, l\u2032 \u2208 N. Since T \u2265 2 and T k \u2264 T m forPk \u2264 m, we can find for each\nk0\nkj\nfinite sequence k1 , . . . , kN \u2208 N a k0 \u2208 N such that N\nj=1 ||T \u03c6|| \u2264 ||T \u03c6||. By\n(34),\nand the definition\nA, it follows that each f \u2208 A can be written as f =\nPM of\u2217n\nPN (32),\nn\n\u22121\nz\np\u2212n (y, y \u22121 ). From the foregoing, we conclude that\nz\np\n(y,\ny\n)\n+\nn\nn=1\nn=0\nthere exist m \u2208 N such that ||f \u03c6|| \u2264 ||T m \u03c6||, consequently || * ||f \u2264 || * ||T m .\nThis shows that the family {|| * ||T 2k }k\u2208N generates the graph topology and DA =\nk\n\u2229k\u2208N D(T\u0304 2 ), which proves (i).\n(ii): By (i), the graph topology is metrizable. It follows from [8, Proposition 2.2.9 and\nCorollary 2.3.2.(ii)] that DA is a reflexive Frechet space, in particular, DA is barreled.\nTo see that DA is nuclear, consider En := (DA , || * ||T n ), where the closure of DA\nis taken in the norm || * ||T n , and the embeddings \u03b9n+1 : En+1 \u2192 En , where \u03b9n+1\ndenotes the identity on En+1 , n \u2208 N. It is easy to see that the operator T\u0304 \u22121 : H \u2192 H\nis a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator and that the canonical basis {ej }j\u2208J , where J = N0 in\ncase (I) and J = Z in case (II), is a complete set of eigenvectors. The set {fjn }j\u2208J ,\nfjn = ||T n ej ||\u22121 ej constitutes an orthonormal basis in En , and we have\nX\n\n||\u03b9n+1 (fjn+1 )||2T n =\n\nj\u2208J\n\nX\n\n||T n fjn+1 ||2 =\n\nj\u2208J\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX\n\n||T n (||T n+1 ej ||\u22121 ej )||2\n\nj\u2208J\n\n||T\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\nej || < \u221e\n\nj\u2208J\n\nwhich shows that \u03b9n+1 is a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator. From this, we conclude that\nDA is a nuclear space since the family {|| * ||T n }n\u2208N of Hilbert semi-norms generates\nthe topology on DA . As each nuclear space is a Schwartz space and as each barreled\nSchwartz space is a Montel space, DA is a Montel space.\n\u2737\nProposition 3.4 Suppose we are given an irreducible *-representation of type (I) or\n(II)\u03b1 . Assume that the O*-algebra A from Proposition 3.2 is closed.\n+\ni. F(DA ) is dense in L(DA , DA\n) with respect to the bounded topology \u03c4b .\n\n13\n\n\fii. The Uq (su1,1 )-action on L+ (DA ) is continuous with respect to \u03c4b .\nProof. (i) follows immediately from Lemma 3.3(ii) and [8, Theorem 3.4.5].\n(ii): Let x \u2208 L+ (DA ) and a, b \u2208 A. According to [8, Proposition 3.3.4(ii)], the multiplication x 7\u2192 axb is continuous. By Lemma 3.1, the action of Uq (su1,1 ) is given by a\nfinite linear combination of such expressions, hence it is continuous.\n\u2737\nThe algebra F(D) is the linear span of operators \u03b7m \u2297 \u03b7n , where n, m \u2208 N0 for the\ntype (I) representation and n, m \u2208 Z for type (II) representations. Since D \u2282 DA ,\nwe can consider F(D) as a subalgebra of F(DA ) and, moreover, as a Uq (su1,1 )-module\n*-algebra. The interest in F(D) stems from the fact that the operators \u03b7n \u2297\u03b7m are more\nsuitable for calculations. With a little extra effort, we can deduce from Proposition 3.4\n+\nthat the linear span of this operators is dense in L(DA , DA\n).\n+\nCorollary 3.5 F(D) is dense in L(DA , DA\n) with respect to the bounded topology \u03c4b .\n\nProof. In view of Proposition 3.4(i), it is sufficient to show that F(DA ) lies in the\nclosure of F(D). With T defined in (47), consider the set of Borel measurable functions\nn\n\nR := { r : \u03c3(T\u0304 ) \u2192 [0, \u221e) ; sup r(t)t2 < \u221e }.\nt\u2208\u03c3(T\u0304 )\n\nIt follows from Lemma 3.3(i) and [6, Proposition 3.4] that the family of semi-norms\n{|| * ||r }r\u2208R ,\n\n||a||r := ||r(T\u0304 )a r(T\u0304 )||,\n\n+\n),\na \u2208 L(DA , DA\n\n(the norm || * || being the operator norm in L(H)) generates the topology \u03c4b .\n2\nLet \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 DA . Notice\nP that ||r(T\u0304 )(\u03c6 \u2297P\u03c8)r(T\u0304 )|| \u2264 ||r(T\u0304 )|| ||\u03c6|| ||\u03c8||. With\n\u03b1n , \u03b2n \u2208 C, write \u03c6 = n\u2208J \u03b1n \u03b7n , \u03c8 = n\u2208J \u03b2n \u03b7n , where J = N\nP0 or J = Z\naccording to the type of representation considered. For k \u2208 N, set \u03c6k := |n|\u2264k \u03b1n \u03b7n\nP\nand \u03c8k := |n|\u2264k \u03b2n \u03b7n . Clearly, \u03c6k , \u03c8k \u2208 F(D). Now\n||\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6k \u2297 \u03c8k ||r = ||r(T\u0304 )(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6k \u2297 \u03c8k )r(T\u0304 )||\n\n\u2264 ||r(T\u0304 )||2 ||\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6k || ||\u03c8|| + ||r(T\u0304 )||2 ||\u03c6k || ||\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8k || \u2192 0\nas k \u2192 \u221e for all r \u2208 R, hence \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 lies in the closure of F(D). Since F(DA ) is the\nlinear span of operators \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8, the assertion follows.\n\u2737\nProposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5 show how F(D) and F(DA ) are related to the\nimage of Oq (U) in L+ (DA ): By density and continuity, F(D) and F(DA ) carry the\n+\nwhole information about the action of Uq (su1,1 ) on L+ (DA ) \u2282 L(DA , DA\n) and, in\n+\nparticular, on Oq (U) \u2282 L(DA , DA ).\nIt would be desirable to have also the converse statement, that is, to obtain the action\n+\non F(D) (or F(DA )) by taking the closure of Oq (U) in L(DA , DA\n). Unfortunately,\nthis is not possible. From [8, Theorem 4.5.4], it follows that \u03c4b coincides with the\nfinest locally convex topology on A. Since A is closed with respect to the finest locally\nconvex topology, it is closed with respect to \u03c4b .\n\n14\n\n\fFor F(D) to be in the closure of Oq (U), we can consider a different\nP locally convex\ntopology on D. Let D\u2032 be the vector space of all formal series j\u2208J \u03b1j \u03b7j , where\nJ = N or J = Z. There exists a dual pairing h*, *i of D\u2032 and D given by\nX\nX\nX\n\u03b1n \u03b2n .\n\u03b2n \u03b7n i =\nh\n\u03b1j \u03b7j ,\nj\u2208J\n\n|n|\u2264n0\n\n|n|\u2264n0\n\nWe equip D and D\u2032 with the weak topologies arising from this dual pairing.

Furthermore, we have\nz n \u03b4k (\u0233) = z n (\u03b7k \u2297 \u03b7k ) = (z n \u03b7k ) \u2297 \u03b7k \u2208 F(D),\n\u03b4k (\u0233)z \u2217n = (\u03b7k \u2297 \u03b7k )z \u2217n = \u03b7k \u2297 (z n \u03b7k ) \u2208 F(D),\nPN\nPM\nhence n=0 z n \u03c8n (\u0233) + n=1 \u03c8\u2212n (\u0233)z \u2217n \u2208 F(D) whenever \u03c8n \u2208 F (\u03c3(\u0233)), n =\n\u2212M, . . . , N .\nOn the other hand, for k \u2264 n, we can write\n\u03b7n \u2297 \u03b7k = \u03b3n,k (z n\u2212k \u03b7k ) \u2297 \u03b7k = \u03b3n,k z n\u2212k \u03b4k (\u0233),\n\u03b7k \u2297 \u03b7n = \u03b3n,k \u03b7k \u2297 (z n\u2212k \u03b7k ) = \u03b3n,k \u03b4k (\u0233)z \u2217n\u2212k ,\n\u22121/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\nwhere \u03b3n,k = (q 2(k+1) ; q 2 )n\u2212k and \u03b3n,k = (\u2212q 2(\u03b1+k+1) ; q 2 )n\u2212k for the representations of type (I) and type (II)\u03b1 , respectively.

By definition of B1 (A), a\u03c8b \u2208 B1 (A) for all a, b \u2208 A whenever \u03c8 \u2208 B1 (A).\nFix a \u2208 A. From the proof of Lemma 3.3(i), we know that {|| * ||T\u0304 n }n\u2208N , T =\n1 + y 2 + y \u22122 , generates the graph topology on DA , so there exist na \u2208 N such that\n||a\u03c6|| \u2264 ||T na \u03c6|| for all \u03c6 \u2208 DA . Consequently, ||aT \u2212na \u03c6|| \u2264 ||\u03c6||, hence aT \u2212na\nand T \u2212na a\u2217 are bounded.

This shows that the operator f from Lemma 3.7 belongs to B1 (A).\nThe commutation relations (48) are satisfied if we restrict the operators to D \u2282 DA .\nConsider the O*-algebra generated by the elements \u03c8(\u0233)\u2308D, \u03c8 \u2208 S(\u03c3(\u0233)), and a\u2308D,\na \u2208 A. Since the operators \u03c8(\u0233) are bounded, the closure of this algebra is contained\nin L+ (DA ). Taking the closure of an O*-algebra does not change the commutation\nrelations, hence Equation (48) holds.\nRecall that A is the linear span of operators z n pn (y, y \u22121 ) and p\u2212n (y, y \u22121 )z \u2217n ,\nwhere pn (y, y \u22121 ) and p\u2212n (y, y \u22121 ) are polynomials in y and y \u22121 .

Similarly, using (33), (48), and the\ndefinition of S(D), it is easy to check that S(D) forms a *-algebra. Therefore, by\nLemma 3.1, S(D) is a Uq (su1,1 )-module *-algebra.\n\u2737\nThe description of F(D) and S(D) by functions \u03c8 : \u03c3(\u0233) \u2192 C suggests that\nwe can consider the elements of F(D) and S(D) as infinitely differentiable functions\non the quantum disc with compact support and which are rapidly decreasing,\nP\u221e respectively.

To this end, we use a commutator representation of the\nFODC. A faithful commutator representation of the above differential calculus can be\nfound in [9] and is obtained as follows.

Notice that, by Equation (2)\nand (10), it is sufficient to describe the action on generators.\n\n20\n\n\f4.2 Representations of the *-algebra Oq (Matn,1 )\nIrreducible *-representations of the twisted canonical commutation relations have been\nclassified in [7] under the condition that 1 \u2212 Q1 is essentially self-adjoint. In this subsection, we study admissible *-representations of the twisted canonical commutation\nrelations without requiring the representation to be irreducible.\nRemind our notational conventions from Subsection 2.2 regarding direct sums of a\nHilbert space K. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on K such that \u03c3(A) \u2291 (q 2 , 1]. Then\nthe expression \u03bcj (A), j \u2208 Z, stands for the operator \u03bcj (A) = (1 + q \u22122j A)1/2 . We\nshall also abbreviate \u03bbj = (1 \u2212 q 2j )1/2 and \u03b2j = (q \u22122j \u2212 1)1/2 for j \u2208 N0 .\nProposition 4.1 Assume that m, k, l \u2208 N0 such that m + l + k = n. Let K denote a\nHilbert space. Set\n\u221e\n\u221e\nH := \u2295\u221e\nin ,...,in\u2212m+1 =0 \u2295ik =\u2212\u221e \u2295ik\u22121 ,...,i1 =1 Hin ...i1 ,\n\nwhere Hin ... i1 = K, and\nD := Lin{\u03b7in ...i1 ; \u03b7 \u2208 K, in , . . . , in\u2212m+1 \u2208 N0 , ik \u2208 Z, ik\u22121 , . . . , i1 \u2208 N}.\n(For l > 0, we retain the notation \u03b7in ...i1 and do not write \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1 ,ik ...i1 .)

In both series, A denotes a self-adjoint operator acting\non the Hilbert space K such that \u03c3(A) \u2291 (q, 1]. In the series (m, l, k), l > 0, v is a\nunitary operator on K such that Av = vA.\nThen the operators z1 , . . . , zn define a *-representation of Oq (Matn,1 ), where the\naction of zj\u2217 , j = 1, . . . , n is obtained by restricting the adjoint of zj to D. Representations belonging to different series (m, k, l) or to different operators A and v are\nnot unitarily equivalent. A representation of this series is irreducible if and only if\nK = C. In this case, v is a complex number of modulus one and A \u2208 (q, 1]. Only the\nrepresentations (m, 0, k) are faithful.\n21\n\n\fProof. Direct calculations show that the formulas given in Proposition 4.1 define a\n*-representation of Oq (Matn,1 ). Clearly, if a *-representation of these series is irreducible, then A and v must be complex numbers and K = C. The converse statement\nwas shown in [7]. That the representations (m, 0, k) are faithful is proved by showing that for each x \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ), x 6= 0, there exist \u03b7in ...i1 , \u03b7jn ...j1 \u2208 H such that\nthe matrix element h\u03b7in ...i1 , x\u03b7jn ...j1 i is non-zero. The vectors can easily be found by\nwriting x in the standard form (59) and observing that zj , zj\u2217 act as shift operators. We\nomit the details. The other assertions of the proposition are obvious.\n\u2737\nRemarks. The operators Qj are given by\nQj \u03b7in ...i1 = q 2(ij +...+in ) \u03b7in ...i1 ,\nQj \u2261 0,\n\nif n \u2212 m < j \u2264 n,\n\n(60)\n\nif k < j \u2264 n \u2212 m,\n\nQj \u03b7in ...i1 = \u2212q\n\n(61)\n\n\u22122(ij +...+ik )+2(in\u2212m+1 +...+in )\n\n2\n\nA \u03b7in ...i1 ,\n\nif 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\n\n(62)\n\nThe numbers m, l, k \u2208 N0 correspond to the signs of the operators Qj , that is, we\nhave Qn \u2265 . . . \u2265 Qn\u2212m+1 > 0 if m > 0, Qn\u2212m = . . . = Qk+1 = 0 if l > 0,\nand 0 > Qk \u2265 . . . \u2265 Q1 if k > 0. The only bounded representations are the series\n(m, l, 0).\nWe now give a constructive method for finding \"admissible\" *-representations of\nOq (Matn,1 ). In view of (56)\u2013(58), the assumptions on admissible *-representations of\nthe *-algebra Oq (Matn,1 ) will include the following two conditions: First, the closures\nof the operators Qk , k = 1, . . . , n, are self-adjoint and strongly commute. Second,\n\u03c6(Q\u0304k )zj \u2282 zj \u03c6(Q\u0304k ), j < k, and \u03c6(Q\u0304k )zj \u2282 zj \u03c6(q 2 Q\u0304k ), j \u2265 k, for all complex\nfunctions \u03c6 which are measurable with respect to the spectral measure of Q\u0304k and which\nhave at most polynomial growth. In the course of the argumentation, we shall impose\nfurther regularity conditions on the operators. The outcome will precisely be the series\nof Proposition 4.1. So, if one takes as admissible *-representations those which satisfy\nall regularity conditions, then Proposition 4.1 states that any admissible *-representation of Oq (Matn,1 ) is a direct sum of *-representation which are determined by the\nformulas of the series (m, l, k), m + l + k = n. The argumentation is based on a\nreduction procedure.\nObserve that zn satisfies the relation of the quantum disc Oq (\u016a ). The \"admissible\"\nrepresentations of this relation are given by Lemma 2.3 and correspond to the cases\n(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1).\nNow let 0 < m < n. Suppose that we are given a *-representation of Oq (Matn,1 )\nsuch that the operators zn , . . . , zn\u2212m+1 act on H = \u2295\u221e\nin ,...,in\u2212m+1 =0 Hin ...in\u2212m+1 by\nthe formulas of the series (m, 0, 0), where all Hin ...in\u2212m+1 are equal to a given Hilbert\nspace, say H0...0 . Fix fn , . . . , fn\u2212m+1 \u2208 N0 . Since the representation is assumed to\nbe admissible, it follows from zn\u2212m Qj = Qj zn\u2212m , n \u2212 m < j \u2264 n, and (60) that the\noperator zn\u2212m maps the Hilbert spaces\nH(fn ) := Lin{\u03b7in ...i1 \u2208 H ; in = fn },\nH(fn , fn\u22121 ) := Lin{\u03b7in ...i1 \u2208 H ; in = fn , in + in\u22121 = fn\u22121 }, . . . ,\nH(fn ,..., fn\u2212m+1 ) := Lin{\u03b7in ...i1 \u2208 H ; in = fn , . . . , in + ... + in\u2212m+1 = fn\u2212m+1 }\n22\n\n\finto itself. But the m equations in = fn , . . . , in + . . . + in\u2212m+1 = fn\u2212m+1 determine\nuniquely the numbers in , . . . , in\u2212m+1 , therefore zn\u2212m maps each Hin ...in\u2212m+1 into\nitself. Write\nzn\u2212m \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1 = Zin ...in\u2212m+1 \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1\nwith operators Zin ...in\u2212m+1 acting on H0...0 . Applying zn\u2212m zj = qzj zn\u2212m , n \u2212 m <\nj \u2264 n, to vectors \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1 gives\nq ij+1 +...+in \u03bbij +1 Zin ...ij +1...in\u2212m+1 \u03b7in ...ij +1...in\u2212m+1 =\nqq ij+1 +...+in \u03bbij +1 Zin ...ij ...in\u2212m+1 \u03b7in ...ij +1...in\u2212m+1 ,\nhence Zin ...ij +1...in\u2212m+1 = qZin ...ij ...in\u2212m+1 . From this, we conclude\nZin ...in\u2212m+1 = q in\u2212m+1 +...+in Z0...0 .\n\u2217\n\u2217\nOn H0...0 , the relation zn\u2212m\nzn\u2212m \u2212 q 2 zn\u2212m zn\u2212m\n= (1 \u2212 q 2 )Qn\u2212m+1 gives\n\u2217\n\u2217\n= 1 \u2212 q2 .\nZ0...0\nZ0...0 \u2212 q 2 Z0...0 Z0...0\n\nHere and subsequently, we suppose that operators satisfying this relation also satisfy\nthe assumptions of Lemma 2.3. By a slight reformulation of Lemma 2.3, we get the\nfollowing three series of *-representations of the last equation:\ni. H0...0 = \u2295\u221e\nin\u2212m =0 H0...0,in\u2212m , H0...0,in\u2212m = H0...0,0 ,\nZ0...0 \u03b6in\u2212m = \u03bbin\u2212m +1 \u03b6in\u2212m +1 ;\nii. Z0...0 = v, where v is a unitary operator on H0...0 ;\niii. H0...0 = \u2295\u221e\nin\u2212m =\u2212\u221e H0...0,in\u2212m , H0...0,in\u2212m = H0...0,0 ,\nZ0...0 \u03b6in\u2212m = \u03bcin\u2212m \u22121 (A2 )\u03b6in\u2212m \u22121 ,\nwhere A is a self-adjoint operator on H0...0,0 such that \u03c3(A) \u2291 (q 2 , 1].\nInserting these formulas into the representation (m, 0, 0) shows that the cases (i), (ii),\nand (iii) correspond to a representation of the operators zn , . . . , zn\u2212m of the series\n(m + 1, 0, 0), (m, 1, 0), and (m, 0, 1), respectively.\nNext, let m, l \u2208 N0 such that m+l < n and l > 0. Set k = n\u2212m\u2212l. Suppose that\nthe operators zn , . . . , zk+1 act on the Hilbert space H = \u2295\u221e\nin ,...,in\u2212m+1 =0 Hin ...in\u2212m+1\nby the formulas of the series (m, l, 0). As in the case (m, 0, 0), we conclude from\nzk Qj = Qj zk , k < j \u2264 n, that zk acts on Hin ...in\u2212m+1 by\nzk \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1 = q in\u2212m+1 +...+in Z0...0 \u03b7in ...in\u2212m+1 ,\nwhere Z0...0 is an operator acting on H0...0 . As Qk = Qk+1 \u2212 zk zk\u2217 and Qk+1 = 0\nby (55) and (61), we have Qk \u2264 0. The assumptions on admissible *-representations\nimply that ker Qk is reducing, Thus we can consider the cases Qk = 0 and Qk < 0\nseparately.\n23\n\n\fFirst let Qk = 0. Then zk zk\u2217 = Qk+1 \u2212Qk = 0, hence zk = zk\u2217 = 0. Consequently,\nwe have obtained a representation of the type (m, l + 1, 0).\nNow assume that Qk < 0. Then, by (54), zk\u2217 zk \u2212 q 2 zk zk\u2217 = 0 and zk\u2217 zk \u2212 zk zk\u2217 =\n(1 \u2212 q 2 )Qk . Inserting the first equation into the second one gives zk zk\u2217 = \u2212Qk ,\n\u2217\nhence |zk\u2217 | = |Qk |1/2 . Evaluating zk\u2217 zk \u2212 q 2 zk zk\u2217 on H0...0 yields Z0...0\nZ0...0 \u2212\n2\n\u2217\nq Z0...0 Z0...0 = 0. Let Z0...0 = U |Z0...0 | be the polar decomposition of the closed\noperator Z0...0 . Since ker zk\u2217 = ker zk zk\u2217 = ker Qk = {0} and ker zk = ker zk\u2217 zk =\n\u2217\n\u2217\nker zk zk\u2217 = {0}, U is unitary. From Z0...0\nZ0...0 \u2212 q 2 Z0...0 Z0...0\n= 0, it follows that\n2\n2\n2 \u2217\n|Z0...0 | = q U |Z0...0 | U and therefore |Z0...0 |U = qU |Z0...0 |. The representations\nof this relation are given by Lemma 2.1. It states that H0...0 = \u2295\u221e\nik =\u2212\u221e H0...0,ik ,\nH0...0,ik = H0...0,0 , and the operators U and |Z0...0 | act as\nU \u03b6ik = \u03b6ik \u22121 ,\n\n|Z0...0 |\u03b6ik = q \u2212ik A\u03b6ik ,\n\nwhere A is a self-adjoint operator on H0...0,0 such that \u03c3(A) \u2291 (q, 1].\nWe have not yet considered the relations zk zn\u2212m = qzn\u2212m zk and zk\u2217 zn\u2212m =\n\u2217\n\u2217\nqzn\u2212m zk\u2217 . On H0...0 , this leads to Z0...0 v = qvZ0...0 and Z0...0\nv = qvZ0...0\n. Thus\n\u2217\n2\n\u2217\nZ0...0 Z0...0 v = q vZ0...0 Z0...0 , or, since v is unitary, |Z0...0 |v = qv|Z0...0 |. This\nimplies U \u2217 v|Z0...0 | = |Z0...0 |U \u2217 v, hence the unitary operator U \u2217 v leaves each space\nH0...0,ik invariant. Therefore there exist unitary operators vik on H0...0,ik such that\nU \u2217 v\u03b6ik = vik \u03b6ik , hence v\u03b6ik = vik \u03b6ik \u22121 . From\nvU |Z0...0 | = vZ0...0 = q \u22121 Z0...0 v = q \u22121 U |Z0...0 |v = U v|Z0...0 |,\nwe conclude vU = U v since ker |Z0...0 | = {0}. This implies\nvik \u03b6ik = U v\u03b6ik = vU \u03b6ik = vik +1 \u03b6ik ,\nthus vik +1 = vik , consequently vik = v0 for all ik \u2208 Z. Evaluating |Z0...0 |v =\nqv|Z0...0 | on vectors \u03b6ik shows v0 A = Av0 . This determines the actions of zn , . . . , zk\ncompletely. Comparing the result with the action of the operators zn , . . . , zk from the\nproposition shows that we have obtained a representation of the type (m, l, 1).\nWe finally turn to a representation of the type (m, l, k), where m + l + k < n\nand k > 0. Set s := n \u2212 (m + l + k). Suppose that the operators zn , . . . , zs+1\n\u221e\n\u221e\nact on a Hilbert space H = \u2295\u221e\nin ,...,in\u2212m+1 =0 \u2295ik =\u2212\u221e \u2295ik\u22121 ,...,is+1 =1 Hin ...is+1 by the\nformulas given in the proposition. Similarly to the case (m, 0, 0), we conclude from\nzs Qj = Qj zs , s < j \u2264 n, that zs maps each Hin ...is+1 into itself. Write\nzs \u03b7in ...is+1 = Zin ...is+1 \u03b7in ...is+1 .\nOn applying zs Qs+1 = Qs+1 zs to a vector \u03b7in ...is+1 , it follows from Equation (62)\nthat Zin ...is+1 A2 = A2 Zin ...is+1 . Thus Zin ...is+1 \u03bcin\u2212m (A2 ) = \u03bcin\u2212m (A2 )Zin ...is+1\nbecause the representation is assumed to be admissible. By using this relations and\nevaluating zs zj = qzj zs , j > s, on vectors \u03b7in ...is+1 , we see that Zin ...ij \u22121...is+1 =\nqZin ...ij ...is+1 and Zin ...ij +1...is+1 = qZin ...ij ...is+1 if s < j \u2264 k and n \u2212 m < j \u2264 n,\nrespectively. Thus we can write\nZin ...is+1 = q \u2212(is+1 +...+ik )+(in\u2212m+1 +...+in ) Z0...0 .\n24\n\n\fWhen l 6= 0, this formula together with zs zn\u2212m = qzn\u2212m zs implies Z0...0 v = vZ0...0 .\nThe relation zs\u2217 zs \u2212 q 2 zs zs\u2217 = (1 \u2212 q 2 )Qs+1 reads on H0...0 as\n\u2217\n\u2217\nZ0...0\nZ0...0 \u2212 q 2 Z0...0 Z0...0\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 q 2 )A2 .\n\nSetting X0 := Z0...0 A\u22121 = A\u22121 Z0...0 and replacing Z0...0 by X0 A, we obtain\nX0\u2217 X0 \u2212 q 2 X0 X0\u2217 = \u2212(1 \u2212 q 2 ).\nBy Lemma 2.3, the admissible *-representations of this relation can be described in the\nfollowing way: H0...0 = \u2295\u221e\nis =1 H0...0,is , H0...0,is = H0...0,1 , and X0 acts by\nX0 \u03b6is = \u03b2is \u22121 \u03b6is \u22121 .\nSince X0\u2217 X0 A = AX0\u2217 X0 , A leaves each Hilbert space H0...0,is invariant. From\nX0 A = AX0 , it follows that the restrictions of A to H0...0,is and H0...0,is \u22121 coincide, hence A acts on H0...0,1 by A\u03b6is = A0 \u03b6is , where A0 is a self-adjoint operator on\nH0...0,1 such that \u03c3(A0 ) \u2291 (q, 1]. Inserting the expression for X0 into Z0...0 = X0 A\nshows that zs acts on Hin ...is+1 ,is by\nzs \u03b7in ...is+1 ,is = q \u2212(is+1 +...+ik )+(in\u2212m+1 +...+in ) \u03b2is \u22121 A\u03b7in ...is+1 ,is \u22121 .\n\u2217\n\u2217\nRecall that vZ0...0 = Z0...0 v when l 6= 0. Moreover, vZ0...0\n= Z0...0\nv since\n\u2217\n\u2217\nX0 v = vX0 and X0 X0 v = vX0 X0 . Therefore it follows by the same reasoning as for\nA that v acts on H0...0,1 by v\u03b6is = v0 \u03b6is , where v0 is a unitary operator on H0...0,1 .\nFrom vA = Av, we conclude v0 A0 = A0 v0 . Inserting A0 and v0 (when l 6= 0) into\nthe expressions for zn , . . . , zs , we obtain for both l = 0 and l > 0 a representation of\nthe list (m, l, k + 1). This completes the reduction procedure.\n\n4.3 Invariant integration on the quantum (n, 1)-matrix ball\nThroughout this subsection, we assume that we are given an admissible *-representation \u03c0 : Oq (Matn,1 ) \u2192 L+ (D) of the series (m, 0, k) such that |Qj |\u22121/2 \u2208 L+ (D)\nfor all j = 1, . . . , n. Set \u01ebj = 1 if j > k and \u01ebj = \u22121 if j \u2264 k. Then we have\nQj = \u01ebj |Qj |.\nTo develop an invariant integration theory on the quantum (n, 1)-matrix ball, we\nproceed as in Subsection 3.1. The crucial step is to find an operator expansion of the\naction.

By (70), the operators Al , Bl , and \u03c1l do not satisfy the defining relations\nof Uq (sun,1 ). If n > 1, then we get only for the series (n, 0, 0) a *-representation of\nUq (sun ) by assigning Kj to \u03c1j , Ej to Aj , and Fj to Bj , j < n.\nTo see this, observe that we must have \u01ebj+2 = \u01ebj by (69). But \u01ebn\u22121 = 1 since\n\u2217\nQn+1 = 1, and \u01ebn = 1 since \u01ebn |Qn | = Qn\u22121 + zn\u22121 zn\u22121\n> 0 by (55) (cf. the\nremarks after Proposition 4.1), so \u01ebn = . . . = \u01eb1 = 1.\nAlthough Equations (66)\u2013(70) do not yield a representation of Uq (sun,1 ), the analogy to (6)\u2013(9) is obvious, so it is natural to try to define an operator expansion of\nthe action by imitating the adjoint action. That this can be done is the assertion of\nthe next lemma. Again, we write f instead of \u03c0(f ) and X \u22b2f instead of \u03c0(X \u22b2f ) for\nf \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ), X \u2208 Uq (sun ).\nLemma 4.3 With the operators \u03c1l , Al , and Bl defined in Lemma 4.2, set\nKj \u22b2 f\n\n=\n\n\u03c1j f \u03c1\u22121\nj ,\n\nEj \u22b2 f\n\n=\n\nAj f \u2212 \u03c1j f \u03c1\u22121\nj Aj ,\n\nFj \u22b2 f\n\n=\n\nKj\u22121 \u22b2 f = \u03c1\u22121\nj f \u03c1j ,\n2\n\nBj f \u03c1j \u2212 q f \u03c1j Bj\n\n(75)\n(76)\n(77)\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , n. Then Equations (75)\u2013(77) applied to f \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ) define an\noperator expansion of the action \u22b2 on Oq (Matn,1 ). The same formulas applied to\nf \u2208 L+ (D) turn the O\u2217 -algebra L+ (D) into a Uq (sun,1 )-module *-algebra.\nProof. The lemma is proved by direct verifications. We start by showing that L+ (D)\nwith the Uq (sun,1 )-action defined by (75)\u2013(77) becomes a Uq (sun,1 )-module *-algebra. That the action satisfies (2)\u2013(4) is readily seen if we replace in the proof of Lemma\n3.1 y \u00b11 by \u03c1\u00b11\nj , A by Aj , and B by Bj . By using Lemma 4.2, it is easy to check that\nthe action is consistent with (6) and the first relations of (7)\u2013(9). For example, (66) and\n(67) give\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u22121\n(Ki Ej )\u22b2f = \u03c1i (Aj f \u2212 \u03c1j f \u03c1\u22121\n= q aij (Aj \u03c1i f \u03c1\u22121\ni \u2212 \u03c1j \u03c1i f \u03c1i \u03c1j Aj )\nj Aj )\u03c1i\n\n= (q aij Ej Ki )\u22b2f,\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(El Ej )\u22b2f = Al (Aj f \u2212 \u03c1j f \u03c1\u22121\nj Aj ) \u2212 \u03c1l (Aj f \u2212 \u03c1j f \u03c1j Aj )\u03c1l Al\n\u22b2\n= Aj (Al f \u2212 \u03c1l f \u03c1l\u22121 Al ) \u2212 \u03c1j (Al f \u2212 \u03c1l f \u03c1l\u22121 Al )\u03c1\u22121\nj Aj = (El Ej ) f\n\n27\n\n\ffor all f \u2208 L+ (D), i, j, l = 1, . . . , n, l 6= j \u00b1 1.

Recall that, for a finite dimensional representation \u03c3 of\nUq (sun,1 ), the quantum trace\n\u22121\nTrq,L a := Tr \u03c3(aK2\u03c9\n)\n\ndefines an invariant integral on Uq (sun,1 ), where \u03c9 denotes the half-sum of all positive\nroots (see [5, Proposition 7.14]). K2\u03c9 is chosen such that XK2\u03c9 = K2\u03c9 S 2 (X) for\nall X \u2208 Uq (sun,1 ). In Subsection 3.1, we replaced K (= K2\u03c9 ) by y and proved\nthe existence of invariant integrals on appropriate classes of functions. Our aim is to\ngeneralize this result to Oq (Matn,1 ).\nPn\nThe half-sum of positive roots is given by \u03c9 = 12 l=1 l(n \u2212 l + 1)\u03c9l . Consider\nQ\n\u2212l(n\u2212l+1)\n\u0393 := nl=1 \u03c1l\n. Inserting the definition of \u03c1l gives\n\u0393 = |Q1 |\u2212n |Q2 | * * * |Qn |, n > 1,\n\n\u0393 = |Q1 |\u22121 , n = 1,\n\n(81)\n\nsince \u2212 21 (l \u2212 1)(n \u2212 l + 2) + l(n \u2212 l + 1) \u2212 21 (l + 1)(n \u2212 l) = 1 for 1 < l \u2264 n. The\noperator |Q1 | appears in the definition of \u0393 twice, in \u03c1\u2212n\nand \u03c1\u2212n\nn , in each factor to\n1\nthe power \u2212n/2. For n = 1, Equation (81) is trivial (cf. Equation (63)). The following\nproposition shows that \u0393 enables us to define a generalization of the quantum trace.\nNotice that zn , zn\u2217 , Kn\u00b11 , En , and Fn satisfy the relations of the quantum disc,\nin particular, Equation (45) applies. Therefore we cannot have a normalized invariant\nintegral on Oq (Matn,1 ).\nProposition 4.4 Let A be the O*-algebra generated by the operators zj , zj\u2217 , |Qj |1/2 ,\nand |Qj |\u22121/2 , j = 1, . . . , n. Then the *-algebras F(D) and B1 (A) defined in (17)\nand (18), respectively, are Uq (sun,1 )-module *-algebras, where the action is given by\n(75)\u2013(77). The linear functional\nh(f ) := c Tr f \u0393,\n\nc \u2208 R,\n\n(82)\n\ndefines an invariant integral on both F(D) and B1 (A).\nProof. From the definition of F(D) and B1 (A), it is obvious that both algebras are\nstable under the Uq (sun,1 )-action defined by (75)\u2013(77), in particular, by Lemma 4.3,\nthey are Uq (sun,1 )-module *-algebras.\nWe proceed as in the proof of Proposition 3.2 and show the invariance of h for\ngenerators by using the trace property Tr agb = Tr gba = Tr bag for all g \u2208 B1 (A),\na, b \u2208 A. Let g \u2208 B1 (A). Clearly, \u03c1l commutes with \u0393, hence\n\u22131\n\u00b11\nh(Kl\u00b11 \u22b2g) = Tr \u03c1\u00b11\nl g\u03c1l \u0393 = Tr g\u0393 = \u03b5(Kl )h(g)\n\n29\n\n\fIt follows from the definition of \u0393 and from (66) that Al \u0393 = q 2 \u0393Al for all l since\n\u2212(l \u2212 1)(n \u2212 l + 2) + 2l(n \u2212 l + 1) \u2212 (l + 1)(n \u2212 l) = 2.\n\u22121\nHence \u03c1\u22121\nand therefore\nl Al \u0393 = \u0393Al \u03c1l\n\nh(El \u22b2g) = Tr (Al g\u0393 \u2212 \u03c1l g\u03c1\u22121\nl Al \u0393) = Tr Al g\u0393 \u2212 Tr Al g\u0393 = 0 = \u03b5(El )h(g).\nApplying the involution to Al \u0393 = q 2 \u0393Al shows that \u0393Bl = q 2 Bl \u0393. Thus\nh(Fl \u22b2g) = Tr (Bl g\u03c1l \u0393 \u2212 q 2 g\u03c1l Bl \u0393) = Tr Bl g\u03c1l \u0393 \u2212 Tr Bl \u03c1l g\u0393 = 0 = \u03b5(Fl )h(g).\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u2737\n\nRemark. As in Subsection 3.1, we consider B1 (A) as the algebra of infinitely differentiable functions which vanish sufficiently rapidly at \"infinity\" and F(D) as the\ninfinitely differentiable functions with compact support.\n\n4.4 Topological aspects of *-representations\nIn this subsection, we shall restrict ourselves to irreducible *-representations of the\nseries (m, 0, k). Let D denote the linear space defined in Proposition 4.1. Then the\noperators |Qj |\u22121/2 , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, belong to L+ (D) and the O*-algebra A of Proposition\n4.4 is well defined. As in Subsection 3.2, we prefer for topological reasons to work\nwith closed O*-algebras. In particular, we suppose that the *-representation is given\non the domain DA = \u2229a\u2208A D(\u0101). It turns out that the topological properties of the\n(closed) O*-algebra A are very similar to that of Subsection 3.2.\nLemma 4.5\ni. A is a commutatively dominated O*-algebra on a Frechet domain.\nii. DA is nuclear, in particular, DA is a Frechet\u2013Montel space.\nProof. The operator\n\u22122\nT := 1 + Q21 + . . . + Q2n + Q\u22122\n1 + . . . + Qn\n\n(83)\n\nis essentially self-adjoint on DA , and T > 2. Let \u03c6 \u2208 DA . As in the proof of\nLemma 3.3, we conclude from a standard argument that, for each polynomial p =\np(|Q1 |1/2 , . . . , |Qn |1/2 , |Q1 |\u22121/2 , . . . , |Qn |\u22121/2 ), there exist k \u2208 N such that ||p\u03c6|| \u2264\n||T k \u03c6||. Furthermore, for each finite sequence k1 , . . . , kN \u2208 N and real numbers\nPN\n\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N \u2208 (0, \u221e), we find k0 \u2208 N such that j=1 \u03b3j ||T kj \u03c6|| \u2264 ||T k0 \u03c6||. Let\np be as above and let I, J \u2208 Nn such that I * J = 0. By (49)\u2013(52) and (55)\u2013(58),\n(z I pz \u2217J )\u2217 (z I pz \u2217J ) is a polynomial in |Qj |1/2 , |Qj |\u22121/2 , j = 1, . . . , n, say p\u0303. Thus\nthere exist k \u2208 N such that\n||z I pz \u2217J \u03c6|| = hp\u0303\u03c6, \u03c6i1/2 \u2264 (||p\u0303\u03c6|| ||\u03c6||)1/2 \u2264 ||T k \u03c6||.\n\n30\n\n\fFrom the definition\nP of A, (59), (71), and (72), it follows that each f \u2208 A can be\nwritten as f = I*J=0 z I pIJ z \u2217J , where pIJ are polynomials in |Qj |1/2 , |Qj |\u22121/2 ,\nj = 1, . . . , n. From the preceding arguments, we conclude that there exist m \u2208 N such\nthat ||f \u03c6|| \u2264 ||T m \u03c6|| for all \u03c6 \u2208 DA , therefore || * ||f \u2264 || * ||T m . This implies that the\nk\nfamily {|| * ||T 2k }k\u2208N generates the graph topology on DA and DA = \u2229k\u2208N D(T\u0304 2 )\nwhich proves (i).\nNote that the proof of Lemma 3.3(ii) is based on the observation that the operator\nT\u0304 \u22121 is a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator. One easily checks that this holds also for the\noperator T defined in (83). Now the rest of the proof runs completely analogous to\nthat of Lemma 3.3.\n\u2737\nProposition 4.6\n+\ni. F(DA ) is dense in L(DA , DA\n) with respect to the bounded topology \u03c4b .\n\nii. The Uq (sun,1 )-action on L+ (DA ) is continuous with respect to \u03c4b .\nThe proof of Proposition 4.6 is completely analogous to that of Proposition 3.4.\nCorollary 4.7 Let F(D) denote the O*-algebra of finite rank operators on D defined\nin (17). Then F(D) is a Uq (sun,1 )-module *-subalgebra of F(DA ) and F(D) is dense\n+\nin L(DA , DA\n).\nProof. Since D \u2282 DA , we can consider F(D) as a *-subalgebra of F(DA ). It follows from Proposition 4.1 that F(D) is stable under the Uq (sun,1 )-action defined in\nLemma 4.3, in particular, it is a Uq (sun,1 )-module *-algebra. The density of F(D) in\n+\nL(DA , DA\n) can be proved in exactly the same way as in Corollary 3.5.\n\u2737\nRecall that the self-adjoint operators Q\u0304j , j = 1, . . . , n, strongly commute. Set\nM := \u03c3(Q\u03041 ) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 \u03c3(Q\u0304n ).\nBy the spectral theorem of self-adjoint operators, we can assign to each (Borel measurable) function \u03c8 : M \u2192 C an operator \u03c8(Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n ) such that\n\u03c8(Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )\u03b7in ...i1 = \u03c8(ti1 , . . . , tin )\u03b7in ...i1 ,\nwhere tij = q 2(ij +...+in +\u03b1) for j > k, tij = \u2212q \u22122(ij +...+ik )+2(ik+1 +...+in +\u03b1) for\nj \u2264 k, and A = q 2\u03b1 . (A denotes the operator appearing in the type (m, 0, k) representations for k > 0. If k = 0, set \u03b1 = 0.) Define\nS(M) =\n{\u03c8 : M \u2192 C;\n\nsup\n(t1 ,...,tn )\u2208M\n\n|ts11 * * * tsnn \u03c8(t1 , . . . , tn )| < \u221e for all s1 , . . . , sn \u2208 Z }\n\nand\nS(D) = {\n\nX\n\nz I \u03c8IJ (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )z \u2217J ; \u03c8IJ \u2208 S(M), #{\u03c8IJ 6= 0} < \u221e }.\n\nI*J=0\n\n31\n\n\fLemma 4.8 With the action defined in Lemma 4.3, S(D) becomes a Uq (sun,1 )-module\n*-subalgebra of B1 (A). The operators zj , zj\u2217 , j = 1, . . . , n, and \u03c8(Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n ),\n\u03c8 \u2208 S(M), satisfy the following commutation rules\n\u03c8(Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304j , Q\u0304j+1 , . . . , Q\u0304n )zj = zj \u03c8(q 2 Q\u03041 , . . . , q 2 Q\u0304j , Q\u0304j+1 , . . . , Q\u0304n )\nzj\u2217 \u03c8(Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304j , Q\u0304j+1 , . . . , Q\u0304n ) = \u03c8(q 2 Q\u03041 , . . . , q 2 Q\u0304j , Q\u0304j+1 , . . . , Q\u0304n )zj\u2217 .\nThe proof of Lemma 4.8 differs from that of Lemma 3.7 only in notation, the argumentation to establish the result remains the same.\nSince F(D) \u2282 F(DA ) and S(D) \u2282 B1 (A), we can consider F(D) and B1 (A)\nas algebras of infinite differentiable functions with compact support and which are\nrapidly decreasing, respectively. It is not difficult to see that F(D) is the set of all\nP\nI\n\u2217J\n\u2208 S(D), where the functions \u03c8IJ \u2208 S(M) have fiI*J=0 z \u03c8IJ (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )z\nnite support. On S(D), we have the following explicit formula of the invariant integral.\nProposition 4.9 Set\nM0 := \u03c3(Q\u03041 )\\{0} \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 \u03c3(Q\u0304n )\\{0}.\nP\nAssume that f = I*J=0 z I \u03c8IJ (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )z \u2217J \u2208 S(D). Then the invariant integral h defined in Proposition 4.4 is given by\nX\n\u03c800 (t1 , . . . , tn )|t1 |\u2212n |t2 | * * * |tn |.\nh(f ) = c\n(t1 ,...,tn )\u2208M0\n\n(If n = 1, then t2 , . . . , tn are omitted.)\nProof. Recall that h(f ) = c Tr f \u0393, where \u0393 is given by (81). If I 6= (0, . . . , 0) or J 6=\n(0, . . . , 0), then h\u03b7in ...i1 , z I \u03c8IJ (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )z \u2217J \u0393\u03b7in ...i1 i = 0 since, by Proposition\n4.1, \u03c8IJ (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n ) and \u0393 are diagonal and z I and z \u2217J act as shift operator on H.\nHence only \u03c800 (Q\u03041 , . . . , Q\u0304n )\u0393 contributes to the trace.\nFor each tuple (t1 , . . . , tn ) \u2208 M0 , there exists exactly one tuple (i1 , . . . , in ) such\nthat \u03b7in ...i1 \u2208 D and Qj \u03b7in ...i1 = tj \u03b7in ...i1 , j = 1, . . . , n. This can be seen inductively; Qn determines in uniquely, and if in , . . . , in\u2212k+1 are fixed, then Qn\u2212k determines uniquely in\u2212k (see the remark after Proposition 4.1). Since the vectors \u03b7in ...i1\nconstitute an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the Qj 's, and since \u0393 is given by\n\u0393 = |Q1 |n |Q2 |\u22121 * * * |Qn |\u22121 for n > 1, \u0393 = |Q1 | for n = 1, the assertion follows. \u2737\nIn the following, let n > 1. We noted in Subsection 4.1 that the action of the\nelements Ej , Fj , Kj\u00b11 , j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 on Oq (Matn,1 ) induces a Uq (sun )-action\nwhich turns Oq (Matn,1 ) into a Uq (sun )-module *-algebra. Uq (sun ) is regarded as\na compact real form of Uq (sln ). Naturally, the compactness should be manifested in\nthe existence of a normalized invariant integral on Oq (Matn,1 ). This is indeed the\ncase. Consider a irreducible *-representation of type (n, 0, 0). Then the operators Qj ,\nj = 1, . . . , n, are bounded, and Q1 is of trace class. In Proposition 4.4, a Uq (sun,1 )invariant functional h was given by h(f ) := c Tr f \u0393, where \u0393 = |Q1 |\u2212n |Q2 | * * * |Qn |.\n32\n\n\fNotice that the proof of Proposition 4.4 uses only the commutation relations of \u0393 with\nAi , Bi , and \u03c1i , i = 1, . . . , n. The crucial observation is that Q1 commutes with Aj ,\nBj , and \u03c1j , j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1. Therefore the commutation relations used in proving\nthe invariance of h remain unchanged if we multiply \u0393 by Qn+1\n. Furthermore, \u0393Qn+1\n1\n1\nn+1\nis of trace class. This suggests that h(f ) := c Tr f \u0393Q1 defines a Uq (sun )-invariant\nintegral on Oq (Matn,1 ). The only difficulty is that the definitions of Aj , Bj , and\n\u22121\n\u03c1\u00b11\nj involve the unbounded operators Qj , therefore we cannot freely apply the trace\nproperty in proving the invariance of h. Nevertheless, a modified proof will establish\nthe result.\nQ\nProposition 4.10 Let n > 1 and set c := nk=1 (1 \u2212 q 2k )\u22121 . Suppose we are given an\nirreducible *-representation of Oq (Matn,1 ) of type (n, 0, 0). Then the linear functional\nh(f ) := c Tr f \u0393Qn+1\n= c Tr f Q1 * * * Qn ,\n1\n\nf \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ),\n\n(84)\n\ndefines a normalized Uq (sun )-invariant integral on Oq (Matn,1 ).\nProof. First note that the vectors \u03b7in ...i1 , i1 , . . . , in \u2208 N0 , form a complete set of\neigenvectors\nof the positive operator Q1 with corresponding eigenvalues q 2(i1 +...+in ) .\nP\n=\nAs i1 ,...,in \u2208N0 q 2(i1 +...+in ) < \u221e, Q1 is of trace class. This implies that f \u0393Qn+1\n1\nf Q1 * * * Qn is of trace class for all f \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ) since the representations of the\nseries (n, 0, 0) are bounded. Therefore h is well defined. An easy calculation shows\nthat h(1) = 1.\nAs in the proof of Proposition 3.2, it suffices to verify the invariance of h for the\ngenerators of Uq (sun ). Recall that Oq (Matn,1 ) is the linear span of the elements\nz I pIJ z \u2217J , where I, J \u2208 Nn0 , I * J = 0, and pIJ is a polynomial in Qi , i = 1, . . . , n. If\nI 6= 0 or J 6= 0, then\nn+1\nI\n\u2217J \u22131\n0 = h\u03b7in ...i1 , \u03c1\u00b11\n\u03b7in ...i1 i = h\u03b7in ...i1 , z I pIJ z \u2217J \u0393Qn+1\n\u03b7in ...i1 i\n1\nj z pIJ z \u03c1j \u0393Q1\n(85)\nby the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition 4.9. Hence\n\nh(Kj\u00b11 \u22b2(z I pIJ z \u2217J )) = \u03b5(Kj\u00b11 )h(z I pIJ z \u2217J ) = 0.\nIf I = J = 0, then\n\n\u22131\nKj\u00b11 \u22b2pIJ = \u03c1\u00b11\nj pIJ \u03c1j = pIJ ,\n\nthus h(Kj\u00b11 \u22b2pIJ ) = h(pIJ ) = \u03b5(Kj\u00b11 )h(pIJ ). This proves the invariance of h with\nrespect to Kj\u00b11 , j = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n\u2217\nRecall that Ak = \u2212q \u22125/2 \u03bb\u22121 Q\u22121\nk+1 zk+1 zk , k < n. If I 6= (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) or\nJ 6= (0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) with 1 in the (k + 1)th and kth positions, respectively, then we\nhave similarly to Equation (85)\n0 =\n=\n\nh\u03b7in ...i1 , Ak z I pIJ z \u2217J \u0393Qn+1\n\u03b7in ...i1 i\n1\nI\n\u2217J \u22121\n\u03b7in ...i1 i.\nh\u03b7in ...i1 , \u03c1k z pIJ z \u03c1k Ak \u0393Qn+1\n1\n\nThus h(Ek \u22b2(z I pIJ z \u2217J )) = \u03b5(Ek )h(z I pIJ z \u2217J ) = 0.\n\n33\n\n\fNow let p denote an arbitrary polynomial in Qi , i = 1, . . . , n. Then, by the definition of \u0393 and repeated application of the commutation rules of Qi with zj and zj\u2217 , we\nobtain\nn+1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nQ\u22121\n= zk+1\nzk zk+1 pzk\u2217 Q1 * * * Qk Qk+2 * * * Qn ,\nk+1 zk+1 zk zk+1 pzk \u0393Q1\n\u22121 \u2217\nn+1\n\u2217\n\u03c1k zk+1 pzk\u2217 \u03c1\u22121\n= zk+1 pzk\u2217 Q1 * * * Qk Qk+2 * * * Qn zk+1\nzk .\nk Qk+1 zk+1 zk \u0393Q1\n\nAll operators on the right hand sides are bounded and Q1 is of trace class, in particular,\nthe trace property applies. Therefore, the difference of the traces of the right hand sides\nvanishes. Hence\nn+1\nh(Ek \u22b2(zk+1 pzk\u2217 )) = c Tr (Ak zk+1 pzk\u2217 \u2212 \u03c1k zk+1 pzk\u2217 \u03c1\u22121\n=0\nk Ak )\u0393Q1\n\n= \u03b5(Ek )h(zk+1 pzk\u2217 )\nwhich establishes the invariance of h with respect to Ek , k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\nTo verify that h is invariant with respect to Fk , k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, notice that\nh(f \u2217 ) = h(f ) for all f \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ) since the operator \u0393Qn+1\nis self-adjoint. Thus,\n1\nby (4) and the preceding,\nh(Fk \u22b2f ) = h(S(Fk )\u2217 \u22b2f \u2217 ) = \u2212q 2 h(Ek \u22b2f \u2217 ) = 0 = \u03b5(Fk )h(f )\nfor all f \u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ).\n\n\u2737\n\nP\nI\n\u2217J\nCorollary 4.11 Let f =\n\u2208 Oq (Matn,1 ).

Taking into account that M0 = {(q j1 , . . . , q jn ) ; j1 , . . . , jn \u2208 N0 } for representations of the series (n, 0, 0), Corollary 4.11 is verified by an obvious modification\nof the proof of Proposition 4.9.\n\u2737\n\n5 Concluding remarks\nIn general, the definition of quantum groups and quantum spaces is completely algebraic. However, our definition of integrable functions involves operator algebras. The\ndiscussion in this paper shows that operator algebras form a natural setting for the study\nof non-compact quantum spaces. For example, Hilbert space representations provide\nus with the powerful tool of spectral theory which allows to define functions of selfadjoint operators. We emphasize that different representations will lead to different\nalgebras of integrable functions. If one accepts that representations carry information\nabout the underlying quantum space (for instance, by considering the spectrum of selfadjoint operators), then representations can be used to distinguish between q-deformed\nmanifolds which are isomorphic on purely algebraic level.\nThe crucial step of our approach was to find an operator expansion of the action.\nAt first sight it seems a serious drawback that no direct method was given to obtain an\n34\n\n\foperator expansion of the action. This problem can be removed by considering cross\nproduct algebras. Inside the cross product algebra, the action can be expressed by algebraic relations. Representations of cross product algebras lead therefore to an operator\nexpansion of the action. Moreover, the operator expansion is given by the adjoint action so that our ideas concerning invariant integration theory apply [15]. Hilbert space\nrepresentations of some cross product algebras can be found in [11] and [15].\n\nReferences\n[1] S.J. Bhatt, A. Inoue, and K.-D. K\u00fcrsten.
