Lett. 24 January 2003; accepted 1 May 2003)\nWe explore the morphological stability during the growth of strained multilayer structures in\na dynamical model which describes the coupling of elastic fields, wetting effect, and deposition\nprocess. We quantitatively show the significant influence of the wetting effect on the stability\nproperties, in particular for short-period multilayers. Our results are qualitatively similar to recent\nexperimental observations in AlAs/InAs/InP(001) system. We also give predictions for strainbalanced multilayers.\n\nStrained periodic multilayer films composed of different material layers have attracted much attention since such\nmaterial structures can have tunable electronic properties. Among the actively investigated systems is the multilayer with alternating tensile/compressive layers coherently grown on a substrate, resulting in a modulated structure\nlike short-period superlattice [e.g., GaAs/InAs1 or AlAs/InAs2,3,4 on InP(001)] or a multiple quantum well [e.g.,\nGaInP/InAsP on InP(001)]5 . Generally morphological instability occurs in such coherent lattice-mismatch multilayer\nstructures, driven by a gradual release of misfit-generated stresses when dislocations are absent. Consequently, undulations are observed in the strained layers, instead of ideally flat interfaces. This stress-driven morphological instability\ncan lead to lateral compositional modulations in vertical short-period superlattices,1,2,3,4 as a result of layer thickness\nmodulations (caused by interface rippling) and different material components in adjacent layers.3,5 The spontaneous\nformation of these lateral modulations is also a promising way to self-organize fabrication of low-dimensional quantum\nheterostructures, especially quantum wires.1,2,3\nAlthough understanding of the detailed growth mechanism in multilayer structures is important and of much interest\nfor both fundamental studies and device applications, it is still far from complete due to the complexity of the system.\nThis complexity arises from the coupling of strain fields in different layers, and the nonequilibrium nature of the\ngrowing film for which material deposition rates play an important role in the pattern formation. Previous theoretical\nanalyses use some approximations to determine the elastic fields, treating each buried island6 or nonplanar interface7\nof the multilayer as a misfitting inclusion in a semi-infinite homogeneous medium. Recently, a general method has\nbeen developed to directly calculate the elastic state of the multilayer system.8\nWetting effects have been considered in the context of single-layer strained film growth,9,10 but not for multilayers.\nIn this letter, we attempt to remedy this. The wetting effect arises from the change of material properties across\ninterlayer interfaces within the system, and is especially important for thin composite layers. Here, we incorporate\nthe wetting effect (arising from nonlinear elastic contributions10 ) in the early morphological evolution of growing\nmultilayer films. We focus on the stability properties of the system and on comparison with recent experiments.\nWe consider a three-dimensional coherent multilayer structure with k stacking layers deposited on a semi-infinite\nsubstrate. In a general case, each composite layer i (1 \u2264 i < k) could consist of a material different from all the other\nPi\nP\nlayers and substrate, with average thickness li and height profile z = hi (x, y) = j=1 lj + q \u0125i (q) exp(iqx x + iqy y).\nThe film/substrate interface is described by \u01250 (q), and the top strained layer k by a surface morphological perturbation\n\u0125k (q, t) and by an average thickness lk = vk t where vk is the deposition rate.\nThe basic state of the system is chosen to be a uniform film of flat growing surface and planar underlying interfaces,\nwith all strains zero except for \u016bzz,i = \u016bi = \u01ebi (1 + \u03bdi )/(1 \u2212 \u03bdi ) due to Poisson relaxation in the z direction. \u01ebi and\n\u03bdi are the misfit and Poisson ratio of layer i, respectively. The elastic free energy of the multilayer is written as\nR h0 3\nP k R hi 3\nFel = \u2212\u221e\nd rE0 + i=1 hi\u22121\nd rEi , where the elastic energy density for each layer i can be generally expressed as\n \u0304\nEi = Ei + \u03b4Ei . Here \u0112i is the energy density of the basic state and \u03b4Ei is the change in energy density due to a\nperturbation. Each of the two terms includes a linear contribution, obtained from linear elasticity, and a nonlinear\ncontribution. The latter is often ignored, but is crucial for the wetting effect.10 It leads to the dependence of \u0112i on\nlayer thickness hi (x, y) \u2212 hi\u22121 (x, y). This dependence is attributed to the coupling between the elastic relaxation of\nlayer i and that of the underlying layer or substrate i \u2212 1. It was shown10 that the thickness dependence of \u0112i enhances\nthe wetting of the substrate by the film in the case of a single layer, and consequently stabilizes the flat surface.\nFor the energy density of the perturbed state, \u03b4Ei , we only keep the linear elasticity contribution \u03b4Eilin = \u03c3\u0304\u03b1\u03b2,i \u03b4u\u03b1\u03b2,i +\n\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03be\u03c1 \u03b4u\u03b1\u03b2,i \u03b4u\u03be\u03c1,i /2 (with \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2,i the stress tensor and \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03be\u03c1 the elastic modulus tensor), since the nonlinear contribution\nis of higher order in the perturbed strains \u03b4u\u03b1\u03b2,i . Thus, we have Ei = \u0112i + \u03b4Eilin . Using the results of Ref. 8 for the\n\n\f2\nfirst-order surface elastic energy density, \u03b4 E\u02c6klin , we obtain the first-order evolution equation for \u0125k (q, t):\nn\no\n(0)\n\u2202 \u0125k /\u2202t = \u03c3k \u2212 \u0393k q 2 [d2 fel,k /dh2k ]hk =h\u0304k (t) \u0125k\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nk\u22121\nk\u22121\nP\nP\nk\u22121\nX\n\u2212q\nli\n\u2212q\nli\n\u2212 \u0393k E \u2032 \u01ebk q 3 e\u2212qvk t \uf8f0\n(\u01ebj+1 \u2212 \u01ebj ) e i=j+1 \u0125j + \u01eb1 e i=1 \u01250 \uf8fb\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nR hi\n(0)\ndz \u0112i (hi \u2212 hi\u22121 , z). The derivatives of the latter quantity\nwith \u03c3k = \u0393k E \u2032 \u01eb2k q 3 \u2212 \u03b3\u0303k (0)q 4 and fel,i (hi\u22121 , hi ) = hi\u22121\nwith respect to hi are taken with fixed hi\u22121 . Here we assumed that surface diffusion is the dominant mass transport\nprocess, with negligible bulk and interlayer diffusion as well as frozen buried interfaces.8 We used a step-function form\nfor surface stiffness (\u03b3\u0303) and misfit stresses (\u03c3\u0304xx,i = \u03c3\u0304yy,i ) at the interlayer interfaces.10 In Eq. (1) \u0393k is the surface\nmobility and \u03b3\u0303k (0) is the surface stiffness at the orientation of the unperturbed surface. The average surface position\nPk\u22121\nis h\u0304k = i=1\nli + vk t, and E \u2032 = 2E(1 + \u03bd)/(1 \u2212 \u03bd) with Young's modulus E and Poisson ratio \u03bd assumed to be\nidentical for all the layers and substrate. Note that the corresponding results for single-layer film can be recovered\nfrom Eq. (1) with k = 1.\nThe evolution Eq. (1) is similar to that without the wetting effect,8 showing explicitly the influence of interface\nmorphologies and elastic properties of different buried layers on the top surface profile. The important results of this\n(0)\nwork arise from the term d2 fel,k /dh2k , which represents the wetting effect. The exact solution of Eq. (1) has a form\nsimilar to the solution in the absence of the wetting effect.8 The surface profile \u0125k can be expressed in terms of the\nproduct of (2 \u00d7 2) characteristic matrices L\u0304j (3 \u2264 j \u2264 k) as well as the profiles \u01251 and \u01252 of first and second deposited\nlayers. The elements of the bottom row of L\u0304j are 1 and 0 and those of the top row are L\u0304j,1 (q) and L\u0304j,2 (q), where\n\u0002\n\u0003\nL\u0304j,1 (q) = \u03bcj (q, lj /vj ) 1 \u2212 \u0393j E \u2032 q 3 \u01ebj (\u01ebj \u2212 \u01ebj\u22121 )Gj (q, lj /vj ) \u2212 L\u0304j,2 (q)/\u03bcj\u22121 (q, lj\u22121 /vj\u22121 ),\nL\u0304j,2 (q) = \u2212\u03bcj (q, lj /vj )e\u2212qlj\u22121 [\u0393j \u01ebj Gj (q, lj /vj )]/[\u0393j\u22121 \u01ebj\u22121 Gj\u22121 (q, lj\u22121 /vj\u22121 )].\n\n(2)\n\nHere\n\u03c3j lj /vj \u2212\u0393j q2\n\n\u03bcj (q, lj /vj ) = e\nZ\nGj (q, lj /vj ) =\n\nlj /vj\n0\n\ndt\u2032 e\n\nR\n\nlj /vj\n0\n\n(0)\n\ndt\u2032 [d2 fel,j /dh2j ]lj =vj t\u2032\n\n\u2212(qvj +\u03c3j )t\u2032 +\u0393j q\n\nR\n2 t\u2032\n0\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n(0)\n\ndt\u2032\u2032 [d2 fel,j /dh2j ]lj =vj t\u2032\u2032\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nIn the following these general results, which can apply to both periodic and nonperiodic systems, are used to\ndetermine the morphological stability of periodic tensile/compressive multilayer structures, and in particular shortperiod superlattices.1,2,3,4 In this case the multilayer film is composed of alternating A and B layers, with their\n\u2217\n, surface mobilities \u0393\u2217A(B) , deposition\nassociated parameters such as nonzero misfits \u01eb\u2217A(B) , layer thicknesses lA(B)\n\u2217\n\u2217\n0\nrates vA(B)\nand surface stiffnesses \u03b3A(B)\n.

To evaluate the\n(0)\nwetting effect, we assume the form dfel,j /dhj = \u0112jlin {1 \u2212 \u03c7j exp[\u2212(hj \u2212 hj\u22121 )/hML,j ]} (for hj > hj\u22121 ) appropriate for\nthe single-layer case, (according to the qualitative modeling calculations in ref. 10, which yield this general functional\nform of wetting elastic energy for various lattice structures with diagonal bonds), where \u0112jlin = E\u01eb2j /(1 \u2212 \u03bd) is the\nlinear elastic energy density of the basic state and hML,j is the 1 ML thickness of layer j (A or B). We also assume\n\u03c7j = \u03c7 = 0.05 for all strained layers.\nFor this periodic A/B system, the characteristic matrices L\u0304j presented in Eq. (2) are reduced to two types, L\u0304A(B) ,\nand the effective stability (for large number of grown layers k \u226b 1) is determined by the maximal magnitude of the\neigenvalues \u03bb of the matrix L\u0304B L\u0304A , as shown in Ref. 8. When max(|\u03bb|) > 1, the initial perturbations are amplified\nafter further deposition, leading to a morphological instability; otherwise, the perturbations decay during the growth,\nleading to a stable flat film profile.\nConsequently, the stability diagrams for various growth and material parameters can be determined, as presented\nin Fig. 1, where in order to compare with experiments, the parameters are chosen to qualitatively represent those of\nthe growth of AlAs/InAs/InP(001) short-period superlattices.3,4 Note that the global strain of the whole multilayer\nfilm can be defined as \u01ebG = \u01ebA [1 + (lB /lA )\u01eb\u2217B ]/(1 + lB /lA ). Thus for \u01eb\u2217B = \u22121 (as in Fig. 1), lB /lA = 1 corresponds to\n\u01ebG = 0, while lB /lA > 1 or < 1 to tensile or compressive films. Similar to previous calculations without the wetting\neffect,8 the stability diagram shows a clear asymmetry: the multilayer film is more stable when the global strain \u01ebG\nhas the same sign as the misfit of the layers with smaller surface mobility. For the system of AlAs/InAs/InP(001),\n\u0393InAs (\u0393A ) \u226b \u0393AlAs (\u0393B ), and then the globally tensile film (\u01ebG < 0) is more stable since \u01ebAlAs < 0, as seen in Fig.\n\n\f3\n1(a) and in experiments. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(a), without the wetting effect (dashed line), the flat film is\nstable only when the global strain is tensile. The situation is qualitatively different when the wetting effect is included\n[solid line in Fig. 1(a)]: both the globally tensile and compressive flat films can be stabilized, although the asymmetry\nin the stability diagram is still obvious.\nThe earlier result with the consideration of the wetting effect is qualitatively similar to experimental observations3,4\n\u2217\nin the following way: We plot [Fig. 1(b)] max(|\u03bb|) as a function of global strain, \u01ebG , for vA\n= 0.05, which corresponds\nto the horizontal dot-dashed line in Fig. 1(a). To evaluate \u01ebG , we set \u01ebA = 3.2% according to the InAs/InP misfit.\nAs explained earlier, when the maximal value of \u03bb is equal to 1, the multilayer film is stable, with a smooth surface;\nwhen it is larger than 1, the film is unstable, leading to a rough surface. Also, the larger the value of max(|\u03bb|), the\nrougher the surface that results, as obtained qualitatively from our theoretical results8 \u0125k \u221d |\u03bb|k/2 for k \u226b 1. Thus,\nthis figure can be compared with the recent rms roughness measurement of Norman et al.,4 where the surface is flat\nor with small roughness for samples under global tension or small compression, but shows a rapidly increasing degree\nof roughness for larger compression. This experimental finding can be qualitatively inferred from our result including\nwetting effect [solid line in Fig. 1(b)], but not from the result without wetting (dashed line).\nWe also find that with the wetting effect, the stability boundary value of lB /lA , above which stabilization is possible,\n\u2217\n\u2217\ndepends sensitively on lA\n+ lB\n, but only very slightly on \u0393\u2217B . The stability boundary value is closer to 1 (the value in\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe absence of the wetting effect) when lA\n+ lB\nis larger, showing that the wetting effect has less influence for thicker\nlayer periods.\nSince some multilayer systems are grown under strain-balance conditions (\u01ebG = 0),5 it is interesting to study the\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\ncorresponding stability properties. The diagrams of lB\n/lA\n(= \u22121/\u01eb\u2217B for \u01ebG = 0) versus vA\nare shown in Fig. 2, where\n\u2217\nthe stability asymmetry remains and is independent of relative mobility \u0393B , indicating more stability for asymmetric\nstructures.8 From Fig. 2, one can see that with the strain-balance constraint, there is no qualitative change due to\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe wetting effect. Also, for short period (e.g., lA\n+ lB\n= 0.3) and large mobility difference (e.g., \u0393\u2217B = 0.001), the\nwetting effect tends to render the film more stable.\nIn summary, we have studied the interplay of elasticity, wetting layer effects and material deposition in coherent\nmultilayer growth, and determined the stability and morphological evolution of growing films. The important influence\nof the wetting effect for short-period multilayers has been calculated, reproducing recent experimental measurements.\nWe hope these results will be helpful for practical growth of low-dimensional nanostructures.\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2021\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nElectronic address: huang@csit.fsu.edu; Present address: School of Computational Science and Information Technology,\nFlorida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306-4120\nElectronic address: daniel.kandel@weizmann.ac.il; Permanent address: Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel\nElectronic address: desai@physics.utoronto.ca\nK.
