The content of the paper is\n1) the definition of the interface free energy from first principles of statistical mechanics;\n2) a detailed exposition of its basic properties.\nWe consider lattice models with short range interactions, like the Ising model. A\nnice feature of lattice models is that the interface free energy is anisotropic so that\nsome results are pertinent to the case of a crystal in equilibrium with its vapor.\nThe results of section 2 hold in full generality.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nInterface free energy in Statistical mechanical\nDefinition of the interface free energy\n\nConsider a physical system at equilibrium in a vessel V , at a first order phase transition\npoint, where two bulk phases, say A and B, coexist (for example, an Ising model at zero\nmagnetic field and low temperature). If, when we bring into contact the phases A and\nB, the state of the system is inhomogeneous and there is spatial separation of the two\nphases, then at the common boundary of the two phases emerges a spatially localized\nstructure, called the interface. In spite of the low dimensionality of these interfaces and\ntheir negligible contribution towards the global overall properties of the physical system\ntheir presence is essential for a wealth of important processes in physics, chemistry and\nbiology. Here we consider only systems at equilibrium, which is a rather severe restriction.\nThe interface free energy is a thermodynamical quantity and it is best explained\nwhen we consider the macroscopic scale, in which the length of the vessel containing\n1\n\n\f2\nthe system is the reference length. Under this scale the interface is well-defined and\nlocalized. In the case of a flat interface perpendicular to a unit vector n it is described\nmathematically by a plane perpendicular to n, which separates the bulk phases, and\nthe state of the system is specified above this plane by giving the value of the orderparameter of one of the bulk phases, say A, and below the interface that of the other\nbulk phase. The interface free energy or surface tension (per unit area) \u03c4 (n) describes the\nthermodynamical properties of the interface at equilibrium. How does one obtain \u03c4 (n)\nonce the interatomic interactions of the system are given? We can answer this question\nso that we get interesting information about \u03c4 (n) only for few models. However, the way\nof defining \u03c4 (n) is quite general and can be applied in principle to most systems, and its\norigin can be traced back to the monumental work of J.W. Gibbs, On the Equilibrium\nof Heterogeneous Substances (1875-1878). In statistical mechanics the thermodynamical\nfunctions are obtained by computing the partition function. The system is enclosed in\na vessel V ; taking into account the interations of the system with the walls of V we\ncan write an expression for the overall free energy of the system. The basic postulate is\nthat we can separate the various contributions to the overall free energy F (V ) at inverse\ntemperature \u03b2 into two parts, up to a small correction term; one part is proportional\nto the volume of V , which is the bulk free energy of the system, and another one is\nproportional to the area of the surface of V , which is interpreted as the wall free energy.\nThus, at a point of first order phase transition, when only phase A is present,\n1\nFA (V ) = \u2212 ln ZA (V ) = fbulk (A)|V | + fwall (A)|\u2202V | + o(|\u2202V |) ,\n\u03b2\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere ZA (V ) denotes the partition function of the system for phase A, |V | the volume\nof V and |\u2202V | the area of the boundary \u2202V of the vessel. A similar expression holds\nfor phase B. The bulk terms fbulk (A) and fbulk (B) are the same because the system\nis at a first order phase transition point, but the surface terms fwall (A) and fwall (B)\nmay be different. Under specific conditions on the walls, we can obtain (macroscopic)\ninhomogeneous states with planar interfaces separating the two coexisting bulk phases.\nIn such cases there is an additional contribution to the overall free energy and we postulate\nthat the free energy can be written as\n1\nFAB (V ) = \u2212 ln ZAB (V ) = fbulk (AB)|V | + fwall (AB)|\u2202V | + \u03c4 (n)|I(n)| + o(|\u2202V |) , (1.2)\n\u03b2\nwith\nfwall (AB) = \u03b1fwall (A) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)fwall (B) .\nThe term |I(n)| = O(|\u2202V |) is the area of the interface perpendicular to the unit vector\nn, and \u03b1 is the proportion of the walls in contact with phase A. Since the system is\nat a first order transition point fbulk (AB) = fbulk (A) = fbulk (B). Extracting wall free\nenergies is not easy, but it is not necessary to do this if our postulate is correct, because\nwe can eliminate the terms involving fwall (AB) and fwall (AB) by considering the ratio of\npartition functions,\n\u2212\n\n1\nZAB (V )\nln\n= \u03c4 (n)|I(n)| + o(|\u2202V |) .\n\u03b2 ZA (V )\u03b1 ZB (V )1\u2212\u03b1\n\nNotice that (1.3) is always a term of order O(|\u2202V |).\n\n(1.3)\n\n\f3\nAn obvious difficulty in getting \u03c4 (n) is that we must know the values of thermodynamical parameters of the system for which there is phase coexistence. Indeed, for other\nvalues of these parameters the system has only one bulk phase and there is no interface.\nHence the surface tension is non-zero only for a specific range of values of the thermodynamical parameters of the system. This is why in many situations one proceeds differently\nin Physics. One models directly the interface in order to bypass these problems and then\nthe interface free energy is simply identified with the free energy of the model for which\none has standard methods for evaluating it. This is often an adequate way to proceed,\nbut it cannot be applied always. For example when one is studying how the coexisting\nphases are spatially distributed inside the vessel V , we cannot avoid considering the free\nenergy of interfaces between coexisting phases.\n\n1.2\n\nA paradigm, the Ising model\n\nWe implement the ideas of section 1.1 for the Ising model, for which the mathematical\nresults are the most complete. We consider the three-dimensional Ising model. The\ntwo-dimensional case is also of interest. Let Z3 := {t = (t1 , t2 , t3 ) : ti \u2208 Z} and\n\u039bLM := {t \u2208 Z3 : max(|t1 |, |t2 |) \u2264 L , |t3 | \u2264 M} .\nFor each t \u2208 \u039bLM , we introduce a variable \u03c3(t), called hereafter spin, which specifies the\nstate of the system at t; there are only two possible states labeled by 1 and \u22121, hence\n\u03c3(t) = \u00b11. The configurations of the system are written \u03c3 and are specified by giving\nfor each site t the value of \u03c3(t). The spin \u03c3(t) interacts with an external real magnetic\nfield h, the interaction energy being \u2212h \u03c3(t), and it interacts with the spin \u03c3(t\u2032 ), the\ninteraction energy being \u2212J(t, t\u2032 ) \u03c3(t)\u03c3(t\u2032 ). The energy of the system is equal to\nHLM (\u03c3) = \u2212\n\n1 X\n2 t\u2208\u039b\n\nLM\n\nX\n\nJ(t, t\u2032 ) \u03c3(t)\u03c3(t\u2032 ) \u2212\n\nX\n\nh \u03c3(t) .\n\nt\u2208\u039bLM\n\nt\u2032 \u2208\u039bLM\n\nWe choose the coupling constants J(t, t\u2032 ) = 0, except if t, t\u2032 are nearest neighbors, in\nwhich case J(t, t\u2032 ) = J > 0, a fixed value. This interaction favors the alignment of spins,\nsince the energy is minimal when \u03c3(t) = \u03c3(t\u2032 ). To model the interaction of the system\nwith the walls, we introduce an inhomogeneous magnetic field J \u2032 \u03b7(t) acting only on the\nspins located at the boundary of the box \u039bL,M ,\nX\n\u03b7\nWLM\n(\u03c3) := \u2212\nJ \u2032 \u03b7(t)\u03c3(t) ,\nt\u2208\u039bLM : |t3 |=M\nor max(|t1 |, |t2 |) = L\n\nwith J \u2032 > 0 and \u03b7(t) = 1 or \u03b7(t) = \u22121, but fixed. Different kind of walls are modeled by\nspecifying different values for \u03b7(t) (see below) and choosing different values for J \u2032 . The\n\u03b7\noverall energy of the system is HLM + WLM\n.\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the state of the system at equilibrium and at\ninverse temperature \u03b2 is the Gibbs measure, so that\n\u03b7\n\ne\u2212\u03b2(HLM (\u03c3)+WLM (\u03c3))\nProb(\u03c3) =\n\u03b7\nZLM\n\n\u03b7\nwhere ZLM\n=\n\nX\n\u03c3\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212\u03b2(HLM (\u03c3 )+WLM (\u03c3 )) .\n\n\f4\n\u03b7\nThe normalization constant ZLM\nis the partition function and the overall free energy of\nthe system in the box \u039bLM is\n1\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n.\nFLM\n(\u03b2, h, J \u2032) := \u2212 ln ZLM\n\u03b2\n\nAt the thermodynamical limit (infinite-volume limit), the bulk free energy per spin\nis independent on the choice of J \u2032 > 0 and of \u03b7,\n1\n\u03b7\nfbulk (\u03b2, h) = lim\nFLL\n(\u03b2, h, J \u2032 ) .\nd\nL\u2192\u221e (2L + 1)\nThe model exhibits a first order phase transition with the magnetization as order-parameter\nif the external magnetic field h = 0 and the inverse temperature \u03b2 > \u03b2c (d), where \u03b2c (d)\nis the inverse critical temperature of the d-dimensional Ising model (0 < \u03b2c (3) < \u03b2c (2)).\nFor h = 0 and \u03b2 > \u03b2c (d) the spin-flip symmetry of HLM is broken. There is a phase\nwith positive magnetization m\u2217 (\u03b2) and another with negative magnetization \u2212m\u2217 (\u03b2);\nthe bulk free energy fbulk (\u03b2, h) is not differentiable at h = 0,\nd\nd\nfbulk (\u03b2, h)|h=0+ = \u2212 fbulk (\u03b2, h)|h=0\u2212 .\ndh\ndh\nIf we choose \u03b7(t) \u2261 +1, respectively \u03b7(t) \u2261 \u22121, that is pure boundary conditions, then\none can prove that for any value of J \u2032 > 0 the interactions with the walls favor the bulk\nphase with positive, respectively negative, magnetization. We are also interested in the\ncase of mixed boundary conditions, which is related to the emergence of a planar interface\nperpendicular to n. Let n = (n1 , n2 , n3 ). We set\n(\n+1 if t1 n1 + t2 n2 + t3 n3 \u2265 0,\n\u03b7 n (t) :=\n\u22121 if t1 n1 + t2 n2 + t3 n3 < 0.\n0 < m\u2217 (\u03b2) =\n\nThus \u03b7 n (t) = 1 iff t is above or in the plane \u03c0(n) perpendicular to n and passing through\n\u03b7n\nn\n.\nthe origin, otherwise \u03b7 n (t) = \u22121.

One can\nprove: the limit (1.4) is independent on J \u2032 \u2265 J, and for \u03b2 > \u03b2c (d) the function \u03c4 (n)\nverifies properties a), b) and c) of (2.7); in the macroscopic limit the measure on the\ndensity profiles is concentrated on the unique magnetization profile\n(\n+m\u2217 (\u03b2) if x is above \u03c0(n)\n\u03c1n (x) :=\n\u2212m\u2217 (\u03b2) if x is below \u03c0(n).\nThis profile describes a macroscopic state with a planar interface perpendicular to n.\nTherefore \u03c4 (n) can be interpreted as the free energy of that interface perpendicular to n.\nThe condition J \u2032 \u2265 J is important, because for some values of J \u2032 < J and \u03b2 the\nphysics near the walls of the system is different: a surface phase transition may take\nplace and portions of the interface may be pinned to the walls. As a consequence of this\nphenomenon in the macroscopic limit the interaction of the system with the walls given by\n\u03b7 n may not induce an interface perpendicular to n. For example, in the two-dimensional\ncase, the macroscopic state may have an interface making an angle with the vertical walls\nof the vessel, whose value is given by the Young-Herring equation, so that (1.4) may not\nbe equal to \u03c4 (n), or, if J \u2032 is small enough and the macroscopic box is a square, then the\nwhole interface may even be pinned to the walls, so that there is no interface through the\n\n\f6\nmacroscopic box. In such cases the limit (1.4) depends on J \u2032 . The condition J \u2032 \u2265 J has a\nsimple physical interpretation; it ensures that the walls of the box V are in the complete\nwetting regime, so that the interface cannot be pinned to the walls. In the literature\nthe standard choice for ferromagnetic models is J \u2032 = J, so that (1.4) gives the correct\ndefinition of \u03c4 (n). These results illustrate the fact that it is important to choose correctly\nthe interactions of the system with the walls in order to use definition (1.3). One must\navoid the possibility of pinning of the interface to the walls. Any wall interactions which\ninduce a macroscopic state with an interface perpendicular to n and such that otherwise\n(1.3) is independent of the chosen interactions are admissible for defining the interface\nfree energy.\nSeveral other definitions for \u03c4 (n) have been proposed for the Ising or similar models.\nMost of them involve a ratio of partition functions and are based on the same pattern\nleading to (1.4) so that we shall not review them here (see section 3 for references). A\npossibility of avoiding the above problem with the walls is to suppress (partially) the\nwalls of the system by taking (partial) periodic boundary conditions. Then one imposes\na condition implying the existence of a single planar interface perpendicular to n. There\nare also variants of (1.4) where one considers a box \u039bLM instead of \u039bLL and take first\nthe limit M \u2192 \u221e before taking L \u2192 \u221e. When J \u2032 < J this limit may give a different\nanswer as the limit (1.4). On the other hand, if J \u2032 \u2265 J, then one can take the limits\nin any order, first L \u2192 \u221e and then M \u2192 \u221e or vice-versa, or simultaneously L \u2192 \u221e\nand M \u2192 \u221e. The reason is that the walls are in the complete wetting regime and the\ninterface is not pinned to the walls. In general it is not easy to show that reasonable\ndefinitions give the same value for \u03c4 (n).\nThe surface tension for the two-dimensional Ising model can be computed exactly.\nOnsager computed the interface free energy for n = (0, 1),\n\u03b2\u03c4 ((0, 1)) = 2(K \u2212 K \u2217 ) , \u03b2 > \u03b2c (2) and \u03c4 ((0, 1)) = 0 , otherwise,\nwhere K \u2217 is defined by exp(\u22122K \u2217 ) = tanh K and K = \u03b2J. Onsager did not use the\ndefinition (1.4); the computation of \u03c4 ((0, 1)) defined by (1.4) is due to Abraham and\nMartin-L\u00f6f. The full interface free energy has been computed by McCoy and Wu.\n1.2.2\n\nInequalities for \u03c4 in the Ising model\n\nWe set in this subsection\nn(\u03b8) := (0, \u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8) and \u03c4 (\u03b8) := \u03c4 (n(\u03b8)) .\nThere are two inequalities which relate the interface free energy and the order-parameter,\n\nand\n\n\u03c4 (0) \u2264 2(m\u2217 (\u03b2))2 ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nd(\u03b2\u03c4 (0))\n\u2265 2(m\u2217 (\u03b2))2 .\nd\u03b2\n\n(1.6)\n\nThese inequalities indicate that \u03c4 (0) > 0 iff there is a phase transition. Since \u03c4 (0) is a\nminimal value, we have \u03c4 (n) > 0 iff h = 0 and \u03b2 > \u03b2c (d).\n\n\f7\nWe now introduce the step free energy \u03c4step . This quantity is interesting only for\nd = 3. Let \u03b7 \u2217 (t) be defined as\n(\n+1 if t3 > 0 or if t3 = 0 and t2 \u2265 0,\n\u03b7 \u2217 (t) :=\n\u22121 if t3 < 0 or if t3 = 0 and t2 < 0.\nBy definition, if d = 3,\n\u2217\n\n\u03c4step\n\n1\nZ\u03b7\n1\nln LL\n:= \u2212 lim\nn\u2217\n\u03b2 L\u2192\u221e 2L + 1 ZLL\n\nwith n\u2217 = (0, 0, 1) .\n\nOne has \u03c4step \u2265 0 and we state two important inequalities. The first inequality\n\u03c4 (\u03b8) \u2212 \u03c4 (0) \u2265 | sin \u03b8|\u03c4step\n\n(1.7)\n\ngives information about the non-differentiability of \u03c4 at \u03b8 = 0. Positivity of \u03c4step implies\nthat \u03c4 (\u03b8) is not differentiable at \u03b8 = 0 since \u03c4 has a minimum at \u03b8 = 0 and\nlim\n\u03b8\u21930\n\nd\n\u03c4 (\u03b8) \u2265 \u03c4step .\nd\u03b8\n\nThe physical consequence of the non-differentiability of \u03c4 is explained at the end of\nsection 2.2.3; non-differentiability of \u03c4 implies the existence of a facet for the equilibrium\nshape W\u03c4 defined in (2.1). The second inequality relates the step free energy of the\nthree-dimensional model to the two-dimensional interface free energy, which we write\nhere \u03c42 (\u03b8),\n\u03c4step \u2265 \u03c42 (0) .\n(1.8)\nTherefore, if \u03b2 > \u03b2c (2) then \u03c4step > 0.\n\n2\n\nBasic properties of the interface free energy\n\nWe examine in this section what are the basic properties of \u03c4 and we discuss the thermodynamical stability of interfaces.\n\n2.1\n\nConvexity of the interface free energy\n\nWe assume that \u03c4 (n) > 0 for each unit vector n. We consider the three-dimensional case.\nElements of the Euclidean space E3 are written x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ); we denote the Euclidean\nscalar product by\nh x|y i := x1 y1 + x2 y2 + x3 y3 ,\nand the Euclidean norm by kxk.\nBy convention \u03c4 (n), with knk = 1, is the physical value of the interface free energy\nof an interface perpendicular to n. It is convenient to extend the definition of \u03c4 to E3 ,\nas a positively homogeneous function, by setting\n\u03c4 (x) := kxk\u03c4 (x/kxk) .\n\n\f8\nWe introduce the half-space\nH(n) := {x : h x|n i \u2264 \u03c4 (n)} ,\nwhose boundary is the plane \u2202H(n) = {x : h x|n i = \u03c4 (n)}. Notice that H(n) = H(tn)\nfor all t > 0. Besides we define the equilibrium shape W\u03c4 as the convex set, which is\nthe intersection of the half-spaces H(n), that is\nW\u03c4 := {x : h x|n i \u2264 \u03c4 (n) , \u2200 n} .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe next argument is due to Herring [H (1951)]; it is reproduced almost in its original\nform. Let T (A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 ) be the tetrahedron with vertices A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 . The face\nopposite to the vertex Ai is denoted by \u2206i ; it contains all vertices Aj , j 6= i, and its area\nis |\u2206i |. Let ni be the outward unit normal to the face \u2206i . We have\n|\u22060 |n0 + |\u22061 |n1 + |\u22062 |n2 + |\u22063 |n3 = 0 .\nSet\nn := \u2212n0 =\n\n|\u22061 |\n|\u22062 |\n|\u22063 |\nn1 +\nn2 +\nn3 .\n|\u22060 |\n|\u22060 |\n|\u22060 |\n\nWe compare the free energies |\u22060 |\u03c4 (n) and |\u22061 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |\u22062 |\u03c4 (n2 ) + |\u22063 |\u03c4 (n3 ), or which\nis the same, \u03c4 (n) and\n|\u22062 |\n|\u22063 |\n|\u22061 |\n\u03c4 (n1 ) +\n\u03c4 (n2 ) +\n\u03c4 (n3 ) .\n|\u22060 |\n|\u22060 |\n|\u22060 |\nLet m1 , m2 , m3 be reciprocal vectors to n1 , n2 , n3 , defined by the relations h mi |nj i = 0\nif i 6= j and h mi |ni i = 1 otherwise. We have h mi |ni = |\u2206i |/|\u22060 |, so that\n3\n3\nX\nX\n|\u2206i |\n\u03c4 (ni ) = h\n\u03c4 (ni )mi |n i \u2261 h y|n i .\n|\u22060 |\ni=1\ni=1\n\nP\nThe vector y = 3i=1 \u03c4 (ni )mi verifies the identities h y|ni i = \u03c4 (ni ), i = 1, 2, 3, i.e. y is\nthe intersection point of the three planes \u2202H(n1 ), \u2202H(n2 ) and \u2202H(n3 ). We have three\ncases.\n(1). If h y|n i < \u03c4 (n), then the intersection of the plane \u2202H(n) with W\u03c4 is empty, since W\u03c4\nis a subset of H(n1 )\u2229H(n2 )\u2229H(n3 ). A (hypothetical) planar interface perpendicular to n\nwith interface free energy \u03c4 (n) can be deformed using the tetrahedron T (A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 )\nby lowering its free energy. Hence, at nonzero temperature such a planar interface with\ninterface free energy \u03c4 (n) is unstable and cannot exist at equilibrium since the free energy\nis minimal. Therefore we must have\n|\u22060 |\u03c4 (n) \u2264 |\u22061 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |\u22062 |\u03c4 (n2 ) + |\u22063 |\u03c4 (n3 ) .\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2). The case h y|n i = \u03c4 (n) is a borderline case. Here the intersection of \u2202H(n) with\nW\u03c4 is at most one point. If \u2202H(n) \u2229 W\u03c4 = \u2205, then one also show that the interface\nis also unstable and cannot exist at equilibrium. If \u2202H(n) \u2229 W\u03c4 = {y}, then y \u2208\nW\u03c4 \u2229 \u2202H(n1 ) \u2229 \u2202H(n2 ) \u2229 \u2202H(n3 ) is called a corner of W\u03c4 . In this case \u2202H(n) is a\n\n\f9\nsupport plane of W\u03c4 at y, that is W\u03c4 \u2282 H(n) and W\u03c4 \u2229 \u2202H(n) \u220b y, but it is not a\ntangent plane of W\u03c4 . Notice that if W\u03c4 has no corner, then at equilibrium we only have\nthe next case (3).\n(3). If h y|n i > \u03c4 (n), then\n|\u22060 |\u03c4 (n) < |\u22061 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |\u22062 |\u03c4 (n2 ) + |\u22063 |\u03c4 (n3 ) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe can repeat the same argument with a right prism whose base is a triangle with\nvertices A0 , A1 , A2 and whose length is very large. Let li be the side of the triangle\nopposite to the vertex Ai , |li | be its length, and ni the outward unit normal to the side\nli in the plane of the triangle. Again we have\n|l0 |n0 + |l1 |n1 + |l2 |n2 = 0 ,\nand we set n := \u2212n0 = |l1 |/|l0|n1 + |l2 |/|l0|n2 . In the plane spanned by n1 and n2 let\nm1 and m2 be reciprocal vectors to n1 and n2 . Then\n2\n2\nX\nX\n|li |\n\u03c4 (ni ) = h\n\u03c4 (ni )mi |n i \u2261 h z|ni .\n|l\n|\n0\ni=1\ni=1\n\nP2\nThe vector z =\ni=1 \u03c4 (ni )mi belongs to the intersection of the planes \u2202H(n1 ) and\n\u2202H(n2 ). We can draw similar conclusions as above. If h z|ni < \u03c4 (n), then the interface\n\u2202H(n) with interface free energy \u03c4 (n) is unstable and does not exist at equilibrium.\nHence, at equilibrium,\n|l0 |\u03c4 (n) \u2264 |l1 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |l2 |\u03c4 (n2 ) .\n(2.4)\nIf h z|ni = \u03c4 (n), then either \u2202H(n) \u2229 W\u03c4 = \u2205 or \u2202H(n) \u2229 W\u03c4 6= \u2205; in the latter case W\u03c4\nhas an edge or a corner and \u2202H(n) is a support plane (but not a tangent plane of W\u03c4 ).\nIf h z|ni > \u03c4 (n), then\n|l0 |\u03c4 (n) < |l1 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |l2 |\u03c4 (n2 ) .\n(2.5)\nSince \u03c4 has been defined as a positively homogeneous function, it is immediate to see\nthat (2.4) for all choices of n1 , n2 , l1 and l2 is equivalent to\n\u03c4 (x + y) \u2264 \u03c4 (x) + \u03c4 (y) \u2200 x, y .\n\n(2.6)\n\nFrom (2.6) one easily gets (2.2) for any tetrahedron. Conversely, if (2.2) is valid for any\ntetrahedron, then we get (2.6) by deforming a tetrahedron into a prism, sending one of\nthe vertex to infinity. The important inequality is (2.6) (or (2.4)).\nTo summarize, for two distinct phases at equilibrium, the interface free energy is a\ncontinuous convex function, which is positive and sublinear, that is\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\n\u03c4 (x) > 0 x 6= 0 ,\n\u03c4 (tx) = t \u03c4 (x) \u2200x and all t \u2265 0 ,\n\u03c4 (x + y) \u2264 \u03c4 (x) + \u03c4 (y) \u2200 x, y.\n\n(2.7)\n\nBy a classical result of Minkowski it is the support function of the convex set W\u03c4 , that is\n\u03c4 (x) = sup{h x|y i : y \u2208 W\u03c4 } .\n\n(2.8)\n\n\f10\n\nWe say that an interface perpendicular to n is (thermodynamically) stable if\n\u03c4 (x + y) < \u03c4 (x) + \u03c4 (y) \u2200 x, y linearly independent, such that x + y = n .\n\n(2.9)\n\nIn that case (2.3) and (2.5) hold. In general the choice of the normal to the interface\ndoes not matter, so that we also have \u03c4 (n) = \u03c4 (\u2212n). This means that \u03c4 (n) defines a\nnorm on E3 .\n\n2.2\n\nInterface free energy and equilibrium shape W\u03c4\n\nWe suppose that \u03c4 is given, verifying properties a), b) and c) of (2.7) (we do not assume\nthat \u03c4 (n) = \u03c4 (\u2212n)). Under these assumptions W\u03c4 is a convex body, i.e. W\u03c4 \u2282 E3 is a\nbounded, closed convex set with non-empty interior. The point 0 is an interior point of\nW\u03c4 , because the continuity of \u03c4 implies that \u03c4 (n) \u2265 a > 0 for all n, knk = 1.\n2.2.1\n\nEquilibrium shape W\u03c4 and its polar dual W\u03c4\u2217\n\nA face F of a convex set K \u2282 E3 is a convex subset F \u2282 K, such that\n1\nx , y \u2208 K and (x + y) \u2208 F\n2\n\nimply x , y \u2208 F .\n\nTwo-dimensional faces are called facets of K and one-dimensional faces are called edges\nof K. An extremal point z of K is a face F = {z}. Equivalently, z is an extremal\npoint if it cannot be written as z = \u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y with x, y \u2208 K and \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), except by\ntaking z = x = y. The set of extremal points is denoted by extK. Minkowski's theorem\nstates that a convex body K is equal to the convex hull of its extremal points, that is\n(\n)\nk\nk\nX\nX\nK = x:\n\u03bbi xi : \u03bbi \u2265 0 ,\n\u03bbi = 1 , xi \u2208 extK \u2200 i , k arbitrary .\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nRemark. In dimension two we call \"facets\" the one-dimensional faces of K \u2282 E2 .\nTo study the convex set W\u03c4 we introduce its polar dual W\u03c4\u2217 . The definition of W\u03c4\u2217\nis based on the dual relationship between non-zero vectors v and closed half-spaces v\u2217\ncontaining the origin,\nv\u2217 := {x : h v|x i \u2264 1} .\nThe polar dual or polar set W\u03c4\u2217 of W\u03c4 is\n\\\nW\u03c4\u2217 := {x\u2217 : x \u2208 W\u03c4 } = {u : h x|u i \u2264 1 \u2200 x \u2208 W\u03c4 } .\n\nFrom the definition it is immediate that W\u03c4\u2217 is a convex set. It is a closed set, since the\nscalar product is continuous, and 0 is an interior point of W\u03c4\u2217 . Hence W\u03c4\u2217 is a convex body.\nSince for x \u2208 W\u03c4 we have h x|u i \u2264 1 for all u \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 , we deduce that W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 \u2283 W\u03c4 . Since\nW\u03c4 is a convex body having the origin as an interior point, we also have W\u03c4 = W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 .\n\n\f11\nIndeed, suppose that z 6\u2208 W\u03c4 . Since W\u03c4 is a closed convex set, there exists a plane\n{x : h x|u i = \u03b1} which separates z and W\u03c4 , i.e.\nW\u03c4 \u2282 {x : h x|u i \u2264 \u03b1} and h z|u i > \u03b1 .\nSince 0 is an interior point of W\u03c4 , we can choose u so that \u03b1 > 0. Therefore, for all\ny \u2208 W\u03c4 , hy|u/\u03b1 i \u2264 1, i.e. u/\u03b1 \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 . Since hz|u/\u03b1 i > 1 we conclude that z 6\u2208 W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 , so\nthat\nW\u03c4 = W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 .\nThere is a simple description of W\u03c4\u2217 in terms of \u03c4 . If \u03c4 (u) \u2264 1, it follows from (2.1) that\nu \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 . Conversely, since \u03c4 is the support function of W\u03c4 , there exists for any u a point\nz \u2208 W\u03c4 such that h z|u i = \u03c4 (u). Therefore, when u \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 , we have \u03c4 (u) = h z|u i \u2264 1.\nHence\nW\u03c4\u2217 = {u : \u03c4 (u) \u2264 1} and \u03c4 (x) = min{t \u2265 0 : x/t \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 } .\n(2.10)\nThe statements in (2.10) mean that \u03c4 is the gauge function of W\u03c4\u2217 . We can interpret\nthe interface free energy either as the support function of W\u03c4 , or as the gauge function\nof W\u03c4\u2217 . The boundary \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 of the polar set is simply the level-1 surface of \u03c4 . Since \u03c4\nis positively homogeneous, the level-t surface is obtained from the level-1 surface by a\ndilation of factor t. Since (\u2202W\u03c4\u2217 )\u2217 = W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 and n\u2217 = H(n) for any n \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 , the boundary\npoints of W\u03c4\u2217 give a natural labeling of the support planes of W\u03c4 (see also section 2.2.2).\n\nPolar set and equilibrium shape. 2D Ising model J = 1, \u03b2 = 3.\nRemark. Since W\u03c4 = W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 we can exchange the roles of W\u03c4 and W\u03c4\u2217 . Let \u03c1 be the\nsupport function of W\u03c4\u2217 . This function is the gauge function of the equilibrium shape\nW\u03c4 , so that\nW\u03c4 = {x : \u03c1(x) \u2264 1} .\nBy definition of the support function (see (2.8)) we have\n\u03c1(x) = sup{h x|y i : y \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 } = sup\ny6=0\n\nh x|y i\n\u03c4 (y)\n\n=\u21d2\n\nh x|y i \u2264 \u03c1(x)\u03c4 (y) .\n\nExample. The H\u00f6lder norms on E3 are defined by\n( P\n\u00011/p\n3\n|xi |\nif 1 \u2264 p < \u221e,\ni=1\nkxkp :=\nmax{|xi | , i = 1, 2, 3} if p = \u221e.\n\n\f12\nSuppose that \u03c4 (x) = kxkp . Then\nW\u03c4 = {x : kxkq \u2264 1} and W\u03c4\u2217 = {x : kxkp \u2264 1} ,\nwhere q verifies 1/p + 1/q = 1.\nThere is another way of expressing the equilibrium shape using \u03c4 . For any y we\nintroduce the affine functional\nx 7\u2192 \u03c6y (x) := h x|y i \u2212 \u03c4 (y) .\nThe half-space H(n) = {x \u2208 R3 : \u03c6n (x) \u2264 0}. The equilibrium shape can be written\nW\u03c4 = {x : sup \u03c6y (x) \u2264 0} .\ny\n\nSince \u03c4 is sublinear it is easy to verify that\n(\n0 if x \u2208 W\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u2217 (x) := sup(h x|y i \u2212 \u03c4 (y)) =\n\u221e otherwise.\ny\nThus the Legendre transform \u03c4 \u2217 of the interface free energy is the indicator function of\nthe equilibrium shape W\u03c4 .\n2.2.2\n\nExtremal support planes and stability of interfaces\n\nWe say that \u2202H(n) is an extremal support plane of W\u03c4 iff \u03c6n (x) cannot be written\nas\n\u03c6n (x) = c1 \u03c6n1 (x) + c2 \u03c6n2 (x) c1 > 0 , c2 > 0 ,\nexcept by taking n1 = t1 n and n2 = t2 n, t1 > 0 and t2 > 0. Let H(n1 ) 6= H(n2 ), c1 > 0\nand c2 > 0 be given. Let n = c1 n1 + c2 n2 and x \u2208 W\u03c4 . Then, by sublinearity of \u03c4 ,\n0 \u2265 \u03c6n (x) = h x|c1 n1 + c2 n2 i \u2212 \u03c4 (c1 n1 + c2 n2 ) \u2265 c1 \u03c6n1 (x) + c2 \u03c6n2 (x) .\nFrom this we conclude that \u2202H(n) is extremal iff\n\u03c4 (n) < c1 \u03c4 (n1 ) + c2 \u03c4 (n2 ) \u2200 n1 , n2 linearly independent, such that c1 n1 + c2 n2 = n ,\nthat is, iff the interface perpendicular to n is stable (see (2.9)). When the support planes\n\u2202H(n) are parametrized by n \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 , \u2202H(n) is extremal iff n is an extremal point of\nW\u03c4\u2217 . Indeed, if n = \u03bbn1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)n2 is a non-extremal boundary point of W\u03c4\u2217 , then\n1 = \u03c4 (n) \u2264 \u03bb\u03c4 (n1 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c4 (n2 ) \u2264 1 =\u21d2 \u03c4 (n) = \u03bb\u03c4 (n1 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c4 (n2 ) ,\nso that \u2202H(n) is non-extremal. Conversely, if \u2202H(n) is non-extremal, then there exist\nc1 > 0, c2 > 0, n1 and n2 so that n = c1 n1 + c2 n2 and \u03c4 (n) = c1 \u03c4 (n1 ) + c2 \u03c4 (n2 ). Putting\nu = n/\u03c4 (n), u1 = n1 /\u03c4 (n1 ) and u2 = n2 /\u03c4 (n2 ), we get\nu=\n\nc2 \u03c4 (n2 )\nc1 \u03c4 (n1 )\nu1 +\nu2\n\u03c4 (n)\n\u03c4 (n)\n\nand\n\nc1 \u03c4 (n1 ) c2 \u03c4 (n2 )\n+\n= 1,\n\u03c4 (n)\n\u03c4 (n)\n\n\f13\nso that u \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 is non-extremal. To summarize, the support plane \u2202H(n) of W\u03c4 , with\nn \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 , is extremal iff n is an extremal point of W\u03c4\u2217 . This happens iff the interface\nperpendicular to n is stable.\nWe can rewrite (2.1) as\nW\u03c4 = {x : h x|n i \u2264 \u03c4 (n) , \u2200 n \u2208 extW\u03c4\u2217 } .\n\n(2.11)\n\nOnly the interfaces perpendicular to n \u2208 extW\u03c4\u2217 are stable. For those n, \u03c4 (n) is welldefined and can be measured experimentally. For n \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 , but not extremal, a flat\ninterface perpendicular to n is unstable and is subject to a hill-and-valley formation built\non the interfaces perpendicular to the m \u2208 extW\u03c4\u2217 entering into the extremal decomposition of n (see [H (1951)]).\nRemark. For a relation between these deformations of the unstable interfaces and the\nphenomenon of thermal faceting, see [H (1951)] and [W (1988)] pp.391-393. It should\nbe stressed however that experiments with crystals and interfaces are rarely done at\nequilibrium so that the thermal faceting is basically a non-equilibrium phenomenon.\nMathematically, the support function of W\u03c4 is defined for any n, and it can be used\nto extend the definition of \u03c4 . Equivalently, by taking the convex hull of extW\u03c4\u2217 we can\ndefine \u03c4 for all n \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 . Hence the hypothesis (2.7) done at the beginning of section\n2.2 are not restrictive.\nExample. There is a tangent plane to W\u03c4 at x iff there is a unique support plane \u2202H(n)\ncontaining x; the outward normal to W\u03c4 at x is well-defined and equal to n. A tangent\nplane is always an extremal support plane. Indeed, suppose that n = \u03bbn1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)n2\nwith 0 < \u03bb < 1 and n1 , n2 \u2208 extW\u03c4\u2217 ; suppose that \u2202H(n) is the unique support plane at\nx \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4 . Then \u03c4 (n) = h x|n i and\n1 = \u03c4 (n) = \u03bbh x|n1 i + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)h x|n2 i \u2264 \u03bb\u03c4 (n1 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c4 (n2 ) = 1 .\nTherefore\n\u03bb (\u03c4 (n1 ) \u2212 h x|n1 i) +(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03c4 (n2 ) \u2212 h x|n2 i) = 0 ,\n{z\n}\n|\n\u22650\n\nand \u03c4 (ni ) = h x|ni i so that \u2202H(ni ) is a support plane at x. Hence n = n1 = n2 , the\ndecomposition of n is trivial and n is an extremal point of W\u03c4\u2217 . We have extremal support\nplanes which are not tangent planes when W\u03c4 has an edge or a corner.\n2.2.3\n\nSubdifferentials of \u03c4\n\nThe subdifferential of \u03c4 at x is the set\n\u2202\u03c4 (x) := {u \u2208 E3 : \u03c4 (y) \u2265 \u03c4 (x) + h u|y \u2212 x i \u2200 y} .\nIt is a closed convex set. An element of \u2202\u03c4 (x) is a subgradient of \u03c4 at x. One can\nprove that differentiability of \u03c4 at x is equivalent to the uniqueness of subgradient; the\nunique subgradient is the gradient of \u03c4 at x, that is, \u2202\u03c4 (x) = {grad\u03c4 (x)} and\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03c4 (x) \u2202\u03c4 (x) \u2202\u03c4 (x)\ngrad\u03c4 (x) =\n,\n,\n.\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\n\f14\nFor x \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 , grad\u03c4 (x) is normal to the tangent plane of the polar set W\u03c4\u2217 at x. Since \u03c4\nis sublinear,\n\u2202\u03c4 (x) = \u2202\u03c4 (tx) \u2200 t > 0 .\nFrom the definition of the subdifferential of \u03c4 at x = 0 one gets another characterization\nof W\u03c4 (\u03c4 (0) = 0)\nW\u03c4 = \u2202\u03c4 (0) .\nFor any n 6= 0, the subdifferential \u2202\u03c4 (n) is the subset of the boundary of the equilibrium\nshape W\u03c4 , which is given by the intersection of W\u03c4 and the support plane \u2202H(n), that is\n\u2202\u03c4 (n) = W\u03c4 \u2229 \u2202H(n)\n\nwhen n 6= 0 .\n\nMoreover, v \u2208 \u2202\u03c4 (n) iff \u2202v\u2217 is a support plane of W\u03c4\u2217 at n/\u03c4 (n).\nIndeed, suppose that v \u2208 \u2202\u03c4 (n). Then\n\u03c4 (u) \u2265 \u03c4 (n) + h v|u \u2212 n i \u2200 u .\nChoosing u = 0, we get h v|n i \u2265 \u03c4 (n). Choosing u = 2n and using the homogeneity of\n\u03c4 , we get \u03c4 (n) \u2265 h v|n i. Therefore \u03c4 (n) = h v|n i and v \u2208 \u2202H(n). But this also implies\n\u03c4 (u) \u2265 \u03c4 (n) + h v|u \u2212 n i = h v|u i \u2200 u ,\nso that v \u2208 W\u03c4 . Conversely, if \u03c4 (n) = hv|n i and \u03c4 (u) \u2265 h v|u i for all u, then\n\u03c4 (u) \u2265 hv|u i = \u03c4 (n) + h v|u \u2212 n i \u2200 u .\nFor the second part notice that if v \u2208 \u2202\u03c4 (n), then \u03c4 (n) = h v|n i, so that \u2202v\u2217 is a\nsupport plane of W\u03c4\u2217 at n/\u03c4 (n). Conversely, if \u2202v\u2217 is a support plane of W\u03c4\u2217 at n/\u03c4 (n),\nthen v \u2208 \u2202H(n) and h v|u i \u2264 1 for all u \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 , so that v \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217\u2217 = W\u03c4 .\nIn summary, a corner of W\u03c4\u2217 at x corresponds to a facet of W\u03c4 perpendicular to x\nsince the subdifferential at x is two-dimensional. Edges of W\u03c4\u2217 correspond to edges of W\u03c4 .\nA facet of W\u03c4\u2217 corresponds to a corner of W\u03c4 since for each x of the facet of W\u03c4\u2217 grad\u03c4 (x)\nis the same and each point of the facet labels a different support plane at grad\u03c4 (x). For\nthe other points x \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 the gradient exists and h grad\u03c4 (x)|x i = 1; at grad\u03c4 (x) \u2208 W\u03c4\nthere is a unique (extremal) support plane perpendicular to x \u2208 W\u03c4\u2217 .\nExample. For the Ising model, at zero temperature, W\u03c4 = {x : kxk\u221e \u2264 1} and W\u03c4\u2217 =\n{x : kxk1 \u2264 1}. In dimension d there are only 2d extremal points for W\u03c4\u2217 corresponding to\nthe 2d facets of W\u03c4 . All other interfaces are unstable. For d = 2, at non-zero temperature,\nthe corners of W\u03c4\u2217 are smoothed out, so that W\u03c4 has no facet. Moreover, W\u03c4\u2217 is strictly\nconvex, so that W\u03c4 has no corner and all points of \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 are extremal points, hence all\ninterfaces are stable. The disappearing of facets is called roughening transition; here\nthe temperature of the roughening transition is zero. In the rough phase, i.e. above\nzero temperature, \u03c4 is differentiable. This situation is generic for two-dimensional cases\nat non-zero temperature. For d = 3, if the temperature is strictly positive and strictly\nsmaller than the two-dimensional critical temperature, inequalities (1.7) and (1.8) imply\nthat there are facets for W\u03c4 corresponding to corners for W\u03c4\u2217 . Notice that by symmetry,\ninstead of taking n(\u03b8) = (0, \u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8) as in subsection 1.2.2, we may also choose\nn(\u03b8) = (\u2212 sin \u03b8, 0, cos \u03b8) or n(\u03b8) = (\u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8, 0). At a higher temperature the system\nundergoes a roughening transition with the disappearing of facets, but this result has not\nyet been mathematically established for the Ising model.\n\n\f15\n2.2.4\n\nRadius of curvature and stability of interfaces\n\nIn this subsection we assume that \u03c4 is strictly convex and smooth (except at the origin).\nAt each point of \u2202W\u03c4 there is a well-defined normal n and W\u03c4 \u2229 \u2202H(n) = {grad\u03c4 (n)}.\nWe consider the two-dimensional case W\u03c4 \u2282 E2 . We set for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0),\nn(\u03b1) := (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1) and m(\u03b1) := (\u2212 sin \u03b1, cos \u03b1) .\nThe vectors n and m are orthonormal and we can decompose grad\u03c4 (n) as\ngrad\u03c4 (n) = h grad\u03c4 (n)|n in + h grad\u03c4 (n)|m im = \u03c4 (n)n + h grad\u03c4 (n)|m im ,\nsince \u03c4 (n) = h grad\u03c4 (n)|n i. We also have\nd\n\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) = h grad\u03c4 (n(\u03b1))|m(\u03b1) i .\nd\u03b1\nTherefore we can parametrize \u2202W\u03c4 by\n\u03b1 7\u2192 grad\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) = \u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) n(\u03b1) +\n\nd\n\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) m(\u03b1) ,\nd\u03b1\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) .\n\nFrom this expression one obtains\nd\ngrad\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) =\nd\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2\n\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) + 2 \u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) m(\u03b1) ,\nd\u03b1\n\nand the radius of curvature \u03c1(\u03b1) at grad\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)), which is given by\n\u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) +\n\nd2\n\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)) .\nd\u03b12\n\n(2.12)\n\nStrict positivity of \u03c1(\u03b1) means absence of corner at grad\u03c4 (n(\u03b1)). There is an interesting\ninequality, noticed by Ioffe, which strengthens the stability condition (2.9). If the radius\nof curvature \u03c1(\u03b1) is bounded below uniformly,\ninf \u03c1(\u03b1) = \u03c7 > 0 ,\n\u03b1\n\nthen\n\u03c4 (x) + \u03c4 (y) \u2212 \u03c4 (x + y) \u2265 \u03c7(kxk + kyk \u2212 kx + yk) \u2200 x, y .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe constant \u03c7 is the best possible constant.\nIn the three-dimensional case, at grad\u03c4 (n) \u2208 \u2202W\u03c4 , n is normal to \u2202W\u03c4 . To study\nthe curvature at this point one can slice W\u03c4 by planes containing n. This reduces the\nproblem to two-dimensional situations. If the radius of curvature in each slice is bounded\nbelow uniformly by \u03c7 > 0, then we get a stronger version of stability inequality (2.3): for\nany tetrahedron T (A0 , A1 , A3 , A3 )\n|\u22061 |\u03c4 (n1 ) + |\u22062 |\u03c4 (n2 ) + |\u22063 |\u03c4 (n3 ) \u2212 |\u22060 |\u03c4 (n) \u2265 \u03c7(|\u22061 | + |\u22062 | + |\u22063 | \u2212 |\u22060 |) .\nIndeed, for x = |\u22061 |n1 , y = |\u22062 |n2 and z = |\u22063 |n3\n\u03c4 (x) + \u03c4 (y + z) \u2212 \u03c4 (x + y + z) \u2265 \u03c7(kxk + ky + zk \u2212 kx + y + zk)\nand\n\u03c4 (y) + \u03c4 (z) \u2212 \u03c4 (y + z) \u2265 \u03c7(kyk + kzk \u2212 ky + zk) .\n\n\f16\n2.2.5\n\nIsoperimetric inequality\n\nGibbs (1878) and Curie (1885) studied a special case of the following variational problem\nconcerning the equilibrium shape of a crystal, and Wulff (1901) gave the geometrical\ninterpretation of the solution showing that the equilibrium shape is obtained by the\nconstruction leading to (2.1). For this reason the equilibrium shape W\u03c4 is often called\nWulff crystal.\nSuppose that V \u2282 Rd , d = 3 or 2, and that n(s) denotes the outward unit normal to\nits boundary \u2202V at s. The surface free energy of this set is given by the surface integral\nZ\nF\u03c4 (\u2202V ) :=\n\u03c4 (n(s)) dHd\u22121 (s) .\n\u2202V\n\nd\u22121\n\n(dH\nis the (d \u2212 1)-Hausdorff measure in Rd .) The problem considered by Wulff was\nto determine the set V , which minimizes the functional F\u03c4 (\u2202V ) among a class of subsets\nwith fixed volume. We state an isoperimetric inequality which gives the solution to this\nproblem. Roughly speaking, the subsets which can be considered are those subsets for\nwhich the functional F\u03c4 is well-defined. Denote by |C| the volume of the subset C \u2282 Rd .\nThen\nF\u03c4 (\u2202V ) \u2265 d|W\u03c4 |1/d |V |(d\u22121)/d .\n(2.14)\nEquality holds if and only iff V = W\u03c4 up to dilation and translation.\n\n2.3\n\nSummary\n\nThe subject of this article is the definition of the interface free energy \u03c4 and its thermodynamical properties once the interatomic interactions of the system are given. Provided\nthat one can construct a macroscopic state with a planar interface perpendicular to n,\none can use formula (1.3) to obtain \u03c4 (n). The fundamental property of the interface free\nenergy is that it is a convex function. The interface free energy can be measured experimentally at equilibrium only for the interfaces which are thermodynamically stable. By\nconvention the physical value of the interface free energy \u03c4 (n) is given for a unit vector n.\nBut, using the extension of \u03c4 as an homogeneous function, this function can be interpreted\neither as the support function of the equilibrium shape W\u03c4 = {x : h x|n i \u2264 \u03c4 (n) , \u2200 n},\nor as the gauge function of W\u03c4\u2217 = {x : \u03c4 (x) \u2264 1}. Stable interfaces are labeled by the\nextremal points of W\u03c4\u2217 .\nThe interface free energy is considered here only from the macroscopic viewpoint; for\nthat reason the macroscopic states of are the relevant states. These states should not\nbe confused with the infinite-volume Gibbs measures, which describe the states of the\nsystem at the microscopic scale, when one chooses as reference length the lattice spacing.\nFor example, for the two-dimensional Ising model one has macroscopic states with stable\ninterfaces for all directions n, while there are only translation invariant infinite-volume\nGibbs measures. The study of interfaces at the microscopic scale, when the interfaces\nare stochastic geometrical objects, is of course an important, related but different topic\n(see references for section 1). When one studies interfaces at the microscopic scale, it is\noften natural and more convenient to replace the definition of the interface free energy by\nanother definition, which is based on specific microscopic properties of the system. One\nessential point is to prove that the definition used is the same as the definition (1.3).\n\n\f17\n\n3\n\nBibliographical Notes\n\nSection 1. [H (1953)], [RW (1984)], [W (1988)], [Z (1988)] are reviews of physics on\ninterfaces and equilibrium shapes of crystals. The reviews [A (1986)] and [P (1983)] are\nmore specifically concentrated on the interface free energy; they are reviews of mathematical physics. The excellent review [A (1986)] also contains a lot of information on\nrelated subjects. Some results concerning the study of interfaces at the microscopic scale\nare discussed in [P (1983)]. The book [Pr (2009)] contains a lot of material related to the\ninterface free energy, which is not presented here.\nThe problem of the spatial distribution of the coexisting phases, starting with the\nmonograph [DKS (1992)], and the papers [ACC (1990)] and [P (1991)], has been one of\nthe major research themes in mathematical statistical mechanics during the last decade\nof the XXth century, for which deep mathematical results have been obtained for several\nmodels. The interface free energy (as defined in section 1.2.1) enters in an essential way\nin the formulation of the results, and interfaces are studied at the microscopic scale. See\nthe review paper [BIV (2000)], the mathematical monograph [C (2004)] and [Pr (2009)].\nSection 1.2. In relation with the topic of the article, chapter 6 of [G (1999)] is a good\nintroduction to the Ising model, but contains few recent results. An up-to-date good\nreference is [V (2009)].\nSection 1.2.1. The macroscopic limit for the two-dimensional Ising model is discussed\nin [PV (1999)]. Using the methods exposed in [BIV (2000)] analogous results can be\nobtain for the three-dimensional case. The up-to-date reference concerning proofs of\nexistence and convexity of surface tension for ferromagnetic models is [MMR (1992)].\nFor more general models see [BP (2003)]. The role of the complete wetting of the walls\nin the definition (1.4) has been explicitly emphasized in [PV (1999)]. The physics of a\nsituation where the interface is partially pinned to the wall had been studied for the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model by Abraham and Ko already in [AK (1989)]. Mathematical\nresults on wetting phenomenon for Ising systems are in [FP (1987)] and [PV (1996)].\nWall free energies are treated in [FC (1977)].\nComparisons of several definitions of the interface free energy are carefully discussed\nin [A (1986)] and references can be found there. The computation of Onsager is in\nhis famous paper where he solved two-dimensional Ising model at zero magnetic field\n[O (1944)]; the computation of Abraham and Martin-L\u00f6f is in [AM (1973)]. The computation of the full interface free energy is detailed in the treatise of McCoy and Wu\n[MW (1973)]. A reference where the results of the computation can be easily found is\n[RW (1981)].\nSection 1.2.2. Inequality (1.5) is proven in [BLP (1980)] and (1.6) in [LP (1981)]. Step\nfree energy is discussed in [A (1986)] and in [BEF (1986)]. Inequality (1.7) is proven in\n[BEF (1986)] and inequality (1.8) in [BFL (1982)].\nSection 2.1. The basic reference is [H (1951)].\nSection 2.2. The basic reference is [H (1951)], but Herring uses the surface tension\nplot, which is the set of points\n{x \u2208 E3 : x = \u03c4 (n) n , knk = 1} ,\n\n\f18\nfor studying \u03c4 . This is the standard way of presenting \u03c4 in physics. One gets the\nsurface tension plot from \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 by an inversion on the unit sphere (or the unit circle\nin dimension 2). Affine parts of \u2202W\u03c4\u2217 become spherical parts, or circular parts, of the\nsurface tension plot. Using the surface tension plot the fundamental convexity property\nof \u03c4 is hidden (this property is not stated explicitly in [H (1951)]); one also looses the\nnatural labeling of the stable interfaces by the extremal points of W\u03c4\u2217 of subsection 2.2.2.\nThe duality between non-zero x and half-spaces x\u2217 is the natural language for discussing\nthe geometry of the equilibrium shape. The use of the polar set W\u03c4\u2217 as an alternative to\nthe surface tension plot is mentioned in [MMR (1992)]. The surface tension plot of the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model is analyzed in [RW (1981)].\nInequality (2.13) appears in [I (1994)] in a slightly different form; the formulation\ngiven is taken from [PV (1999)].\nThe mathematics of subsections 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 is classical and treated thoroughly in\n[M (1911)]. An accessible modern reference is chapter 1 of [S (1993)].\nThe isoperimetric inequality is a classical topic in analysis. There are many papers on\ninequality (2.14), e.g. [D (1944)] (one of the early proofs), [T (1978)] and [F (1991)]. The\nproof of (2.14) in these papers is based on Brunn-Minkowski inequality. In dimension\ntwo a different approach is possible [DP (1992)].\n\nReferences\n[A (1986)]\n\nAbraham D.B.: Surface Structures and Phase Transitions\u2013Exact Results,\npp. 1\u201374 in Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena vol 10, eds Domb\nC., Lebowitz J.L., Academic Press, London (1986).\n\n[AK (1989)]\n\nAbraham D.B., Ko L.-F.: Exact derivation of the modified Young equation for partial wetting, Phys.
