The recent discovery of the iron-based\nsuperconductors[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has stimulated a lot of\ninterest concerning underlying mechanism for superconductivity in this new superconductor family. It has been\nestablished by various measurements[6, 7, 8] that there\nexists an SDW order in the undoped LaOFeAs compound\nbelow T \u223c 150 K, which quickly disappears with the\nelectrons doped into the system, where the superconducting phase starts to set in with transition temperatures being raised beyond 50 K.[5, 9] While the general\nphase diagram[1, 2, 3, 4, 9] reminds us some interesting similarities with the cuprate superconductors, the delectrons on Fe seem much more itinerant with multiorbitals crossing the Fermi level as indicated by the band\nstructure calculations,[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] compared to the isolated Cu3dx2 \u2212y2 -O2px,y antibonding orbitals in the cuprates. Many theoretical proposals are\nbased on itinerant approaches[17, 18, 19, 20] with the\nemphasis on the important role played by various magnetic fluctuations, while some conjectures are also made\nfrom the side of large-spin Mott insulators.[21]\nThe LDA calculations[14, 15] have found an energetically robust SDW state at the antiferromagnetic (AF)\nmomentum Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0) with a large Fe moment \u223c 2.3\u03bcB\nper site, but experimentally only a weak SDW ordering\nwith a different magnetic momentum Qs = (\u03c0, 0), which\nfurther doubles the unit cell of the former SDW state\ncomposed of two Fe per cell, has been identified[7, 8] in\nthe undoped case. The latter SDW (called stripe type\nbelow) was predicted by the first principle band structure calculation[6] due to the nesting Fermi surfaces of\nthe hole and electron pockets, which is much more \"fragile\" and easily destroyed as the doped electrons fill up\nthe small hole pockets at small doping.\nIn this paper, we will make a very simple proposal by\nassuming that the SDW state with an AF momentum\nQ remains strong locally in both the undoped and small\ndoped regime. The corresponding profile of the electron\ndensity of states is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Schematic profile of the density of states\nnear the Fermi energy in the presence of the local SDW meanfields Ma and Mb , which decide the \"charge gaps\" for the aorbital and b-orbital bands according to H0 [(9)]. The lower\nhalf of each band (the so-called \u03b1-band, see text) is assumed\nbelow the Fermi energy EF and is filled, while the upper half\n(the \u03b2-band) is only partially filled. Here a-bands refer to the\nbands passing the Fermi level, which are more dxy , dxz , dyz\nlike, and b-bands are more of dx2 \u2212y 2 character according to\nthe LDA result.[14, 15]\n\nBased on this minimal model, we can show that the longrange part of this SDW is actually generically unstable,\nby coupling to the charge carriers near the Fermi level.\nSuch instability can result in a weak stripe-type SDW\norder in the undoped case where the nesting Fermi surfaces are present, and naturally a superconducting condensation when the former is destroyed at small doping.\nIn this whole regime, however, the local order of such an\nSDW remains robust to \"protect\" the low-energy physics,\nwhich resembles the role of the \"Mott gap\" in the cuprate\nsuperconductors.[22]\nMinimal Model. In our model Hamiltonian Heff =\nHband + HI , the first term is a tight-binding model\nX a,b \u2020\nHband = \u2212\ntij cia\u03c3 cjb\u03c3\n(1)\nij,a,b,\u03b1\n\nwhich describes the electron effective hoppings between\n\n\f2\nthe Hund's coupling. Under this assumption, the longwavelength, low-energy fluctuations of ni may be treated\nas an independent degree of freedom. ni will be selfconsistently determined by coupling to the electrons near\nthe Fermi level in Heff .\nEffective theory. One may redefine ni as the new \u1e91-axis\nfor the spin index of the electron spinor operator:\n\u0109ia = Ui \u00e2ia\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u00e2\u2020ia = (\u00e2\u2020ia,\u2191 , \u00e2\u2020ia,\u2193 ) by an SU(2) rotation\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) The iron atoms form a square lattice with the dashed diamond denoting the unit cell of the\nSDW order state with magnetic momentum Q. (b) The magnetic Brillouin zone (BZ) is illustrated by the dashed diamond\nshape. Two circles at the \u0393 and M points are hole and electron pockets connected by a momentum Qs . The smaller\nsquare is a reduced BZ corresponding to an enlarged unit cell\nindicated by the largest square in (a).\n\nthe d-orbitals of the Fe ions on square lattice (Fig. 2(a))\nat the nearest neighboring (NN) and next nearest neighboring (NNN) sites, including intra- and inter-orbital\nhoppings with the superscripts a, b specifying the orbitals. There have been several proposals[14, 16, 19, 20]\nfor Hband based on the LDA calculations in order to capture the relevant bands near the Fermi energy.\nThe second term HI reflects the effective influence\nof the Coulomb interaction on the d-electrons, which\nincludes the on-site and NN repulsions as well as the\nHund's rule ferromagnetic coupling, and has the following \"mean-field\" look\nHI = \u2212\n\nX\ni,a\n\nMia * Sia\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Mia denotes an effective SDW mean-field felt by\nthe electron spin Sia of the orbital a atPsite i.

We shall make the following ansatz\ni\n\nMia = Ma (\u22121) ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a single unit vector (\u22121)i ni will describe the true\npolarization direction of Mia . Here the staggered factor\n(\u22121)i is introduced such that ni = n\u0302 will correspond to a\ntrue AF order, but in a general case ni will not be fixed\naround a particular direction as only the relative change\n\u2206\u03b1 ni \u2261 ni+\u03b1\u0302 \u2212 ni (\u03b1\u0302 = x\u0302, \u0177) will enter the Hamiltonian\nas shown below.\nThe local SDW field Ma will be assumed large according to the LDA calculation,[14, 15] with the magnetization at different orbitals tightly aligned together by\n\nUi\u2020 ni * \u03c3\u0302Ui = \u03c3\u0302z .\n\n(5)\n\nThen HI simply reduces to\nX\nz\nMa (\u22121)i Sia\nHI = \u2212\n\n(6)\n\ni,a\n\nwhile Hband becomes\nHband = \u2212\n\nX\n\nij,a,b\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n\u2020\nta,b\n\u00e2\nU\nU\nij ia\ni j \u00e2jb\n\n(7)\n\nWe may further rewrite\nHeff = H0 + H1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere H0 \u2261 HI + Hband [Ui\u2020 Uj = 1] is simply an SDW\nmean-field Hamiltonian for the multibands, which can\nbe diagonalized as\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\n\u2020\nH0 =\n\u03beka+ \u03b1\u0302\u2020ka \u03b1\u0302ka + \u03b2\u0302ka\n\u03b2\u0302ka\nk,a\n\n\u2212\n\nX\nk,a\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2020\nEka \u03b1\u0302\u2020ka \u03b1\u0302ka \u2212 \u03b2\u0302ka\n\u03b2\u0302ka + const.\n\n(9)\n\nby a canonical transformation \u00e2ka = uak \u03b1\u0302ka \u2212\nvka \u03c3\u0302z \u03b2\u0302ka , \u00e2k+Qa = vka \u03c3\u0302z \u03b1\u0302ka + uak \u03b2\u0302ka with uak =\n\u00031/2\n\u0002\n\u00031/2 a\n\u0002\na\u2212\na\u2212\na\na\n.

Note that the\nband label a here can be different from the original orbital\nlabel in (1) because of the mixture of orbitals, and in\nobtaining (10), the same Ma is assumed for the mixed\norbitals. Here k is defined in the magnetic Brillouin zone\n(BZ) with the magnetic momentum Q = (\u03c0, \u03c0), which\ncoincides with the BZ of two irons per unit cell (Fig.\n2(b)).\nNow let us consider the term with Ui\u2020 Uj 6= 1:\n\u0011\nX a,b \u2020 \u0010 \u2020\n(11)\nH1 = \u2212\ntij \u00e2ia Ui Uj \u2212 1 \u00e2jb\nij,a,b\n\n\f3\nWe shall focus on the case in which the \u03b1-bands are all\nfilled up by the electrons, and the Fermi energy is located in some of \u03b2-bands, which corresponds to both the\nundoped and electron-doped (or slightly hole-doped) situations as illustrated by Fig. 1. After integrating out\nthe \u03b1-bands and by assuming \u2206\u03b1 ni is small, H1 may be\nsimplified[23] (at large Ma ) to\nH1\n\ndominate over Jeff on general grounds,[25] reflecting the\nfact that the hopping energy is always dominant over the\nsuperexchange energy locally, leading to the instability\nof the AF long-range order.\n\"Stripe\" instability in the undoped case. According to\nthe band structure calculations,[14, 15] in the undoped\ncase, there are hole-pockets around the \u0393 point and electron pockets around the M point around the Fermi level,\n\u0001 \u2020\n1 X\n\u03b2k,\u2212\u03c3 which are connected by a particular nesting momentum\n\u2207\u03b5k * (Dq )\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 \u2212\u03b8k+q + \u03c3 \u03b8\u0304k+q \u03b2k+q,\u03c3\n\u2243\n2\nQs , and can be described by H0 with the proper choice\nk,q,\u03c3\nof\n\u03b5ak . Then, to take advantage of the enhanced response\nX\nJeff\n2\n(\u2206ni )\n(12) function at Qs in H0 , the interaction term H1 will natu+ H.c. +\n8 i\nrally induce\n\nwhere Dq is a Fourier transformation of\n1\nDi = (\u2206ni \u00d7 ni ) * Ui\u2020 \u03c3\u0302Ui\n2\n\n(13)\n\nand \u03b8k+q (\u03b8\u0304k+q ) is the step function restricting k + q\nwithin (outside) the magnetic BZ. Note that for simplicity we have omitted the band indices in (12), where\nthe spiral field Dq will couple to the electrons from all\n\u03b2-bands near the Fermi level. It shows that the twist\nof ni is kinetic energy driven. Such a spiral twist is\nbalanced by the \"superexchange\" term in H1 , where\n\u00012\nP\nJeff \u2243 1/N ka (1 \u2212 n\u03b2ka ) \u03beka\u2212 /Eka provides the spin\nstiffness against the twist of the SDW order and is mainly\ncontributed by the filled \u03b1-bands and is reduced with the\nincreasing filling n\u03b2k in the \u03b2-bands.\nSome technical remarks with regarding the derivation of (12) are in order. Strictly speaking, the dynamic field ni should be introduced in a path-integral\nformalism,[23, 24] where the temporal term Ui\u2020 \u2202t Ui will\nalso enter the Lagrangian. As shown previously for the\none-band Hubbard model,[23, 25] the terms like Ui\u2020 \u2202t Ui\nwill play an important role in determining the dynamics of ni at half-filling where an SDW long-range order is present. In this case, by expanding ni around\n\u1e91, Dq \u2243 iq(nq \u00d7 \u1e91) * \u03c3\u0302, the propagator of Dq reduces\n\u22a5\nto Ds (q, t) \u223c qq n\u22a5\nq (t) * nq (0) which is proportional\nto the spin-wave propagator with the coupling to doped\nparticles vanishing as q \u2192 0. However, once a finite density of the holes or electrons are doped into the system,\nthe dynamic spiral fluctuation of Dq which couples to\nthe doped charge carriers in (12) will become dominant\nover the other fluctuation terms like Ui\u2020 \u2202t Ui , leading to\nintrinsic instabilities[25] of the system (see below).\nThe propagator D(q, t) = \u2212i hTt Tr [Dq (t)D\u2212q (0)]i\ncan be obtained by integrating out the \u03b2-band\nD(q, \u03c9) \u2243 \u22121/ [\u03a0\u03b2 (q, \u03c9) + Jeff ]\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03a0\u03b2 (q, \u03c9) is the \"bubble\" diagram contribution\nof the \u03b2-band electrons, with the \"bare\" \u03a00\u03b2 (0, 0) \u223c\n\u2212vF2 NF \u223c \u2212t where vF and NF are the Fermi velocity\nand density of states based on H0 , which is expected to\n\n(15)\n\u2207\u03b5k * hDQs i 6= 0\nE\nD\n\u2020\nand result in a mean-field \u03b2k+Q\n\u03b2k,\u2212\u03c3 6= 0 with a\ns ,\u03c3\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 \u00d7 2 folding of the BZ as shown in Fig. 2(b). Consequently a gap will be opened up at the Fermi energy\nto stabilize D(q, \u03c9) in (14). In contrast to the unstable\nSDW with the AF momentum Q, the true magnetic ordering (15) is realized with an additional spiral twist at\nmomentum Qs , which, known as a stripe-type SDW, was\nfirst predicted in Ref. [6] and has been recently confirmed\nexperimentally by neutron scattering.[7, 8]\nSuperconducting instability. With introducing a small\namount of doped electrons, the Fermi energy will move\nup such that the small hole pockets around the \u0393 point\nget filled up and the Fermi surface nesting disappears.\nThen the static \"stripe\" SDW order (15) vanishes, and\nDq will become unstable again.\nRewriting\nUi\u2020 Uj = Ui\u2020 Ui1 Ui\u20201 Ui2 Ui\u20202 ...Ui\u2020N\n\nij \u22121\n\nUj\n\n(16)\n\nwith {is } = i0 , i1, ..., iNij a sequence of lattice sites connecting i \u2261 i0 and j \u2261 iNij and using Ui\u2020s Uis+1 \u2243\n1 + iDis * \u03b7\u0302is+1 ,is \u2243 eiDis *\u03b7\u0302is +1,is (\u03b7\u0302is +1,is = ris +1 \u2212 ris )\n(neglecting the phase associated with the solid angle\nspanned by nis ,nis+1 , \u1e91), one finds\n\u001c\n\u001d\nZ j\nE\nD\n\u2020\ndr * D\nUi Uj \u223c exp i\ni\n\n\u0015\nZ Z j\n1\n\u2032\ndr * hDDi * dr\n\u2243 exp \u2212\n2\ni\n\"\n#\n2\n|i \u2212 j|\n\u2243 exp \u2212\n2\u03bes2\n\u0014\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\nthe\nspin\ncorrelation length\n\u03bes\n\u223c\n\u0002 R\n\u00031/2\n1/ \u2212 d\u03c9ImD(0, \u03c9)\n.\nUnless ImD(q, \u03c9) \u2192 0\nat q \u2192 0 as in the spin wave case, the spiral fluctuations\nin (14) will generally lead to a spin disordered state\nwith a finite \u03bes , but its precise nature has to be selfconsistently determined in view of the divergent D(q, \u03c9)\nin the small q and \u03c9 regime.\n\n\f4\nThe dynamic spiral fluctuations of the magnetization\ndirections are kinetic energy driven by the electrons near\nthe Fermi level. However, this will also make the electrons lose their long-wavelength coherence. Indeed, the\nsingle-particle propagator for the electrons to leading order of approximation can be written as\nD\nE\nGe (i, j; t) \u2243 Ui\u2020 (t)Uj (0) Ga\n(18)\n\nwhere Ga is the propagator for the a-particles whose leading term is coherent governed by the mean-field Hamiltonian H0 in (9). Thus the dynamic spiral fluctuation will\nquickly damp the coherent motion of theD quasiparticle\nE\nbeyond the spin correlation length \u03bes via Ui\u2020 (t)Uj (0) .\nBy contrast, after averaging over the\nni -field, the elec\u02c6 SC \u2261 P \u03c3c\u2020 c\u2020\ntron singlet pair operator \u2206\nij\ni\u03c3 j\u2212\u03c3 can be\n\u03c3\nexpressed by\nEX\nD\n\u2020\nU\n\u03c3a\u2020i\u03c3 a\u2020j\u2212\u03c3\n\u2243\nU\n\u2206SC\nj\nij\ni\n\u03c3\n\n\u2248\n\nX\n\n\u03c3a\u2020i\u03c3 a\u2020j\u2212\u03c3\n\n(19)\n\n\u03c3\n\nat |i \u2212 j| \u226a \u03bes . It clearly shows that in such a spin\ndisordered state, the singlet pairs of electrons can still\npropagate coherently. The above contrast between the\nsingle electron and singlet pairs of electrons indicates an\ninstability\nof the system towards superconductivity with\nP D \u2020 \u2020 E\n\u03c3\na\na\ni\u03c3 j\u2212\u03c3 6= 0. The latter can be indeed realized\n\u03c3\n\nby exchanging the dynamic spiral fluctuations, D(q, \u03c9),\nbetween the \u03b2-electrons based on (12), which in turn stabilizes D(q, \u03c9) through a renormalized \u03a0\u03b2 (q, \u03c9) as the\n\u03b2-electrons form Cooper pairs. It is noted that the stabilized ReD(q, \u03c9) < 0 at small q and \u03c9 will lead to an\nattractive (repulsive) interaction between \u03b2-electrons if\nk + q is within (outside) the magnetic BZ according to\n(12). It means that the \u03b2-electrons will form the dominantly dx2 \u2212y2 -wave pairing at four M points in Fig.\n2(b), similar to the case in the cuprates. Physically this\nkinetic-energy-driven pairing can be understood as that\ntwo electrons sitting at, say, NN sites, gain enhanced hopping energies by sharing the spiral twist of ni 's between\nthe two sites.\nDiscussions. It is interesting to point out that Tc is\nupper bounded in the BCS theory because, whereas the\nsoftening phonon can enhance the attractive force, it also\nleads to the structural instability of the solids. Here\nthe superconductivity is caused by strong dynamic spiral\nfluctuations which are in a \"melting\" SDW regime. Tc\nis expected to fall when such dynamic spiral fluctuations\nget reduced at higher electron doping concentration (the\nlocal magnetization Ma should be eventually destroyed\nwhen the Fermi level reaches beyond the highest \u03b2-band\nshown in Fig. 1, presumably the one with the dominant\ndx2 \u2212y2 characters according to the LDA calculation[15]).\n\nAlthough the d-electrons in Fe-based compounds are\nbelieved quite itinerant, our proposal suggests that the\nunderlying physics is still far from the conventional itinerant magnetic metals in the following sense. Due to the\npresence of a large local SDW mean-field Ma , each band\nnear the Fermi level are still split into the lower and upper Hubbard bands, with the lower one filled by the electrons in both undoped and electron-doped cases, which\nare responsible for the origin of large Ma 's. In contrast to\nthe single-band Hubbard model relevant to the cuprate\nsuperconductors,[22] however, here some of the upper\nHubbard bands are already at the Fermi level even in the\nundoped case. A search for the depleted density of states\nbelow the Fermi level by, say, photoemission,[26] may\nprovide useful information concerning the correctness of\nthe present model. The presence of a sizable local moment, which is distinguished from the itinerant approach,\nmay be also investigated via various magnetic measurement above Tc , including the magnetic susceptibility.[27]\nFinally we caution that in the present model the effect\nof the unit cell doubling with two irons per cell due to the\ncrystal field reason (As ions are displaced above and below the Fe plane alternatively) has not been considered,\nwhich may drastically affect our results if it becomes sufficiently strong because in that case the \u03b1- and \u03b2-band\nsplitting due to the local SDW may no longer be complete\nand \u03b1-bands can become partially filled.\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a simple effective\nmodel to describe the low-energy physics in FeAs superconductors. This model is based on an assumption that\nthere exists a robust local SDW order, but its magnetization direction is intrinsically unstable against forming\na true long range order due to the competition with the\nkinetic energy of the charge carriers near the Fermi energy. In the undoped case, a weak SDW order of stripe\ntype is formed due to the peculiar nesting structure of the\nFermi surfaces. In the doped case, the dynamic melting\nof the SDW order will result in the d-wave superconducting pairing of the doped electrons near the Fermi energy.\nAcknowledgments: Stimulating discussions with\nZ.Y.
