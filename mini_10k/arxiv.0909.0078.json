We\nanalyze this problem in the frequency domain and propose a practicable method to compensate the phase difference by inserting a spatial light modulator, which substantially improves the entanglement of the photon pairs\nwithout any loss.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Bg 78.55.Cr 42.50.-p\n\nEntangled photon pairs play a crucial role in much of quantum information processing [1\u20134]. The most widely used\nmethods for generating entangled photon pairs involve nonlinear optical processes, such as spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC) [5, 6]. However, high multi-photon probabilities and low quantum efficiencies associated with SPDC\npose serious limitations on their applications in quantum information processing.\nAs an alternative, biexciton decays in single quantum dots\n(QDs) have been proposed as good sources of \"on-demand\"\nentangled photon pairs [7]. QDs also have the advantages\nof a mature fabrication technology and ease of integration\ninto larger structures to make monolithic devices. However,\n\"which-path\" information provided by the fine-structure splitting (FSS) of the intermediate exciton state destroys the entanglement of photon pairs [8]. To overcome this problem, the\nenergy splitting is tuned to near zero either by rapid thermal\nannealing [9], or optionally applying in-plane electric fields\n[10], magnetic fields [11, 12], uniaxial stresses [13] or light\nfields [14]. Such \"triggered\" entangled photon pair sources\ncan also be engineered by simply selecting appropriate QDs\nwith small FSSs [15], by energy-resolved post-selection [16],\nand by using highly-symmetric, site-controlled quantum dots\ngrown in inverted pyramids [17].\nIn considering the photon emission distribution in the time\ndomain, the two-photon state created in a QD is [18]\n\u03a8(t) = (\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212t\ne \u03c4 HXX HX +\n\u03c4\n\nr\n\n\u221a\n1 \u2212t iS t/~\nVXX VX )/ 2,\ne\u03c4e\n\u03c4\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S denotes the FSS energy, t is the time delay between\nthe first (biexciton) and the second (exciton) photon emission\n\u2212t\nevents, 1\u03c4 e \u03c4 is the exciton photon emission probability distribution, and \u03c4 is the exciton lifetime. Thus time integration\nwill reduce the overall degree of entanglement, and even lead\nto classically correlated states [19].\nIn this Report, we analyze this problem in the frequency\ndomain and propose an optical arrangement to compensate\n\n\u2217 email:\n\ncfli@ustc.edu.cn\n\nthe phase difference.\u221a Given the maximally entangled state\n(HXX HX + VXX VX )/ 2, the fidelity is greatly improved and\nin our method is accompanied without photon losses, thus\nsurpassing previous schemes that apply timing gates [19] and\nemploy energy-resolved post selection [16].\nBy Fourier Transformation, we can re-express the twophoton state in the frequency domain\n\u221a\n\u03a8(\u03c9) = ( fH (\u03c9)ei\u03c6H HXX HX + fV (\u03c9)ei\u03c6V VXX VX )/ 2, (2)\nwith fH (\u03c9)\n=\n{2\u03c0\u03c4[1/(2\u03c4)2 + 1/\u03c92 ]}\u22121/2 , \u03c6H\n=\n\u22121\ntan (\u22122\u03c9\u03c4), fV (\u03c9) = {2\u03c0\u03c4[1/(2\u03c4)2 + 1/(S /~ \u2212 \u03c9)2 ]}\u22121/2 , \u03c6V =\ntan\u22121 [2\u03c4(S /~ \u2212 \u03c9)].\nThe polarization density matrix is given by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 1 0 0 \u03b1 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n1 \uf8ec\uf8ec 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n(3)\n\u03c1 = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n2 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed 0 0 0 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\u2217\n\u03b1 0 0 1\nR\nwith \u03b1 = fH (\u03c9) fV (\u03c9)ei\u03c6 d\u03c9 and \u03c6 = \u03c6V \u2212 \u03c6H is the phase\ndifference. The fidelity with Bell state is\nZ\n1\nf = [1 +\nfH (\u03c9) fV (\u03c9) cos \u03c6d\u03c9].\n(4)\n2\nFSS limits the degree of entanglement in two ways, as illustrated in Figure 1. First, the phase difference between H- and\nV-polarized photons reduces the fidelity after time integration.\nSecond, the overlap between their photon frequency distributions decreases as the FSS energy increases. We concentrate\nfirst on the phase difference.\nPhase compensation is generally difficult to realize in the\ntime domain, because it requires an accurate phase delay\n(\u223cS t/~) rapidly varying with time. As shown in Fig. 1(b),\nthe phase distribution is clearly a non-monotonic function of\nfrequency, so it is also impossible to realize this compensation\nby simply using a dispersive element. The proposed experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. The light from the QDs\nshould initially be collimated and focused. For widely-used\nself-assembled QDs, the separation between biexciton (XX)\nand exciton (X) emission lines is generally several meV because of the biexciton binding energy [20], that then enables\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\nBiexciton State\n\nH\n\nV\n\nH\n\nV\n\nFSS\n\nH\n\nV\n\nH\n\nization to V (H) polarization. The half-wave plate (HWP) and\nthe polarizer placed before the detectors are used to choose\nthe polarization state for coincidence detection. All gratings,\nincident angles, and optical paths are identical in both arms of\nH and V polarization. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the phase difference is driven close to zero after which is divided in many\nsmall steps. Here each step corresponds to an angular frequency bandwidth of \u2206\u03c9 \u0011 1 \u00d7 1010 /s. Some parameters have\nbeen chosen, the vertical distance between the two parallel\ngratings is 0.29 meters, the gratings' constant d = 1.1 \u03bcm,\nand the incident angles satisfy sin i = 0.18. The angular frequency \u03c9 = 2.124 \u00d7 1015 /s, corresponds to a wavelength of\n0.887 \u03bcm. We choose the length of each step in front of the\nmirror as \u2206 = 20 \u03bcm, which is much larger than the photon\nwavelengths.\n\nV\n\nGround State\n\nmirror\n\ni\n\nSLM\ngratings\n\n(b)\ngratings\n\nlights from QD\n\nQWP\n\nDM\n\ngratings\n\nX\n\nPBS\n\nXX\n\nHWP\nPolarizer\nSPD\n\nCoincidence\n\nFIG. 1: (a) The level diagram of the radiative decay of the biexciton\nstate.

The XX photons go\ndirectly to SPD, while the X photons are separated into two arms by\nPBS. To realize the phase compensation, a SLM is inserted in one of\nthe paths.\n\nBased on equation (4), the variation fidelity with FSS energy is shown in Fig. 3, where the dotted line corresponds\nto the phase difference \u03c6 as mentioned above, and produces\nexactly the same results as obtained in the time domain [18].\nThe solid line corresponds to the ideal case without phase difference (i.e, \u03c6 = 0). Here the QD exciton lifetime \u03c4 is set\nto 0.77 ns which is consistent with experimental observations\n[18].\nSeveral methods can be used to realize this sectionalized\ncompensation spatially, such as an optical coating with varying thickness, a medium of varying refractive index, or Fiber\n\n\f3\nBragg Grating (FBG) which is the standard dispersion compensation techniques used in optical fiber communications\n[21]. However the more appropriate method would be to use a\nphase-only spatial light modulator (SLM), which can change\nthe phase delay distribution spatially pixel by pixel with an\nelectric signal. This is important in this scheme as different\nQDs have different FSS energies, and hence their phase distributions differ. The advantages is that while other methods\nmay require completely new fabrication to adapt to certain\nQDs, here with a SLM, different QDs just require changes\nin the electric signal for each pixel of the SLM. The phase\nrange shown in Fig. 1(b) can never be larger than \u03c0, therefore\nthe phase compensation can be easily realized with a SLM.\nMoreover, SLMs with pixel resolution of 20 \u03bcm are commercially available, and even 5 \u03bcm resolution can be achieved. A\nhigher resolution will give finer compensations, and thus obtain the fidelity closer to the ideal altough at the expense of\nphoton loss due to diffraction. With 20 \u03bcm length steps, corresponding to the bandwidth \u2206\u03c9 \u0011 1 \u00d7 1010 /s, the result is\nalready very close to the ideal case as shown in Fig. 3. The\ndashed line gives the result after phase compensation and the\nsolid line shows the ideal case when \u03c6 = 0. Furthermore,\nfor \u2206 = 20 \u03bcm, diffraction effects are negligible. The photon\nloss caused by diffraction can be estimated as \u03bb/\u2206, which is\nvanishingly small in this case.\n1.0\n\nFidelity\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFSS H\u039ceVL\n\nFIG. 3: The variation of fidelity with FSS energy. The dotted line\nis without phase compensation. The solid line shows the ideal case\nwithout any phase difference while the dashed line gives the results\nwith phase compensation as mentioned in the text.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, with a FSS energy S of 2.5 \u03bceV, the\nfidelity increases from 0.553 to 0.764 after phase compensation. Even with S of 3.8 \u03bcev, the fidelity is still over 0.7 after\nphase compensation. We have noted that in a published report\nthat with S of 2.5 \u03bceV obtained by applying a timing gate,\nthe fidelity increases from 0.46 with a gate width of 2 ns to\n0.73 with a gate width of 49 ps [19]. A simple calculation\ngives a theoretical collective efficiency of 0.925 with the 2 ns\ngate, but rapidly declines down to 0.061 with the 49 ps gate.\n\nIt is obvious that to get higher fidelity more photons have to\nbe rejected by the timing gate. In contrast, we improve the\nfidelity by a factor of 0.21 without any photon loss theoretically. Considering the practical performance of the gratings\n(efficiency \u223c 90%) and the SLM (efficiency \u223c 95% ), we estimate the experimental efficiency of 62% in performing phase\ncompensation. The bare postselection in energy [16] is even\nmore wasteful than applying a timing gate [19], since one has\nthere to select a small fraction of photons with overlapping\nfrequencies, and further ensure that the phase difference does\nnot change much in the selected frequency band.\nEven after phase compensation, the fidelity unfortunately\ncannot attain unity, because it is limited by the photons outside\nthe overlapping part of the frequency. Further improvements\nin fidelity can be achieved by rejecting these photons. For example, an even better performance than that of the ideal case\nshown with solid line in Fig. 3, can be achieved in cooperation\nenergy-resolved postselection as reported in Ref. [16]. With\nphase compensation, this postselection can be more efficient\nand result in a much enhanced performance in fidelity. To illustrate the point, let S=2 \u03bceV, if the angular frequency bandwidth is set at {2.1240006 \u00d7 1015/s, 2.1240024 \u00d7 1015/s}, then\nafter phase compensation, the fidelity increases from 0.578 to\n0.9 with a theoretical efficiency of 0.2 (still much higher than\nthat obtained by applying a timing gate). Our result means that\nif a relative low efficiency can be tolerated, even a non-zero\nFSS is acceptable and required no magnetic or other fields\nto tune the FSS to zero, thus greatly simplifying the experimental setup. As reported previously [22], calculations reveal\nthat InAs/InP QDs offer smaller FSSs with only a little flux\naround zero for individual QDs. Very recently, Mohan et al.\n[17] reported that highly symmetric, site-controlled quantum\ndots show FSS energies of several \u03bceV. Utilizing these types\nof QDs, our scheme may lead to a practical entangled photon\npairs source that is efficient and easy to control.\nAnother advantage of this setup is that it is easy to control\nthe output phase, an aspect that is highly desirable in a multitude of contexts in quantum information processings. This\nis achieved simply by either allowing the SLM to introduce a\nconstant delay, or changing the optical path in one of the arms.\nIt should be noticed that we have not considered the effect\nof spin flipping and background light here, which in practice\nmay slightly degrade the experimental results. Further studies\nwould need to include the evolution of these effects and others,\nand try to solve them in the frequency domain.\nTo summarize, we have analyzed the degradation in entanglement of photon pairs emitted from QDs with non-zero FSS,\nand proposed a phase compensation scheme with the insertion\nof a SLM to greatly enhance entanglement gaining theoretical\nefficiencies approaching 100%. An even better performance\nin fidelity can be achieved in cooperation with frequency postselection.\nThis work was supported by National Fundamental Research Program, National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (Grant No. 60621064, 10874162, and 10734060).\n\n\f4\n\n[1] Special issue of Proc.
