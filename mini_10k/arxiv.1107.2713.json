From toric varieties to toric schemes\nDuring the last forty years a huge amount of work on toric varieties was and still\nis published. Their theory was generalised in several directions, and this often lead\nto a better understanding of classical toric varieties. However, the generalisation\nthat seems to be the most natural and the most important \u2013 the study of toric\nvarieties from a scheme-theoretical point of view \u2013 was never actually carried out.\nIt is clear that to do this one has to be able to make arbitrary base changes. Hence,\ninstead of considering toric varieties over an algebraically closed field (or, as often\ndone, over the field of complex numbers), one needs to study toric schemes, that is\n\"toric varieties over arbitrary base rings\". Special cases of this generalisation were\nmentioned briefly in [3, \u00a74] (for regular fans and mainly over the ring of integers)\nand [9, IV.3] (over discrete valuation rings). But unfortunately later authors seemed\nto ignore this, and hence the knowledge of toric schemes is very small compared to\nthe one of toric varieties.\nBesides yielding a better understanding of the geometry of toric varieties, there\nare concrete applications of the above generalisation, as the following remark shows.\n(0) Let X be the toric variety over an algebraically closed field K associated\nwith a fan \u03a3. A fundamental question in algebraic geometry is then if the Hilbert\nfunctor HilbX/K of X over K is representable, i.e. if the Hilbert scheme of X\nexists (cf. [7]). If X is projective, then this is indeed the case and follows from\nGrothendieck's more general result [7, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3.1]. However, toric varieties are\nnot necessarily projective, and in general it is not known whether their Hilbert\nschemes exist. Studying HilbX/K amounts to studying quasicoherent sheaves on\nthe base change X \u2297K R for every K-algebra R, and it turns out that X \u2297K R is\nthe same as the toric scheme over R associated with \u03a3.

Here we give an\noverview of the most important results and refer the reader to the aforementioned\nsources for a more extensive treatment including proofs.\n1. The geometry of toric schemes\nWe start by briefly describing the construction of toric schemes from fans. In\n[13], toric schemes are obtained as a special case of the more general construction\nof schemes from so-called openly immersive projective systems of monoids (also\nyielding the Cox schemes introduced below).\n\nR\n\nZ\n\n\u2022 From now on let V be an -vector space of finite dimension n, let N be a structure on V (i.e. a subgroup of rank n of the additive group underlying V with\nhN iR = V ), and let M := N \u2217 denote the dual of N which is a -structure on the\ndual V \u2217 of V .\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nR\n\nAn N -polycone (in V ) is the set of -linear combinations with coefficients in \u22650\nof a finite subset of N , and an N -polycone is called sharp if it does not contain a\nline. If \u03c3 is an N -polycone then a face of \u03c3 is a set of the form \u03c3 \u2229 Ker(u) for some\nu \u2208 \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M (where E \u2228 := {v \u2208 V \u2217 | v(E) \u2286 \u22650 } for a subset E \u2286 V ). The set\nof faces of a (sharp) N -polycone is a finite set of (sharp) N -polycones. An N -fan\n(in V ) is a finite set \u03a3 of sharp N -polycones that is closed under taking faces and\nsuch that the intersection of two cones in \u03a3 is a common face of both of them. By\nmeans of the relation \"\u03c4 is a face of \u03c3\", denoted by \u03c4 4 \u03c3, we consider an N -fan as\nan ordered set.\n\nR\n\n\u2022\n\nFrom now on let \u03a3 be an N -fan in V and let R be a ring 1.\n\nIf \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 then \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M is a torsionfree, cancellable, finitely generated submonoid\nof M , and if moreover \u03c4 4 \u03c3 then \u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M is a submonoid of \u03c4 \u2228 \u2229 M . Taking\nspectra of algebras of monoids over R and setting X\u03c3 (R) := Spec(R[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ]) for\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 we get an inductive system (X\u03c3 (R))\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 of R-schemes over \u03a3. Its inductive\nlimit exists and is an R-scheme denoted by X\u03a3 (R) \u2192 Spec(R) and called the toric\nscheme over R associated with \u03a3 (and N ). It can be understood as obtained by\nglueing (X\u03c3 (R))\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 along (X\u03c3\u2229\u03c4 (R))(\u03c3,\u03c4 )\u2208\u03a32 .\nThe above construction of toric schemes gives rise to a contravariant functor X\u03a3\nfrom the category of rings to the category of schemes together with a morphism\nX\u03a3 \u2192 Spec. Moreover, the functor X\u03a3 is compatible with base change in the\nfollowing sense.\n(1) Proposition ([13, 1.6]) There is a canonical isomorphism\nX\u03a3 (\u2022) \u223c\n= X\u03a3 (R) \u2297R \u2022\nof contravariant functors from the category of R-algebras to the category of Rschemes.\n1By a ring, group or monoid we always mean a commutative ring, group or monoid, respectively,\nand by an algebra we always mean a commutative, unital and associative algebra.\n\n\fON TORIC SCHEMES\n\n3\n\nIn particular, if a \u2286 R is an ideal then X\u03a3 (R/a) is canonically identified with a\nclosed subscheme of X\u03a3 (R).\nThe first important question is now of course how the base ring affects the\ngeometry of a toric scheme. It turns out that some basic properties hold for all\ntoric schemes, making them a class of \"nice schemes\". More precisely, on use of the\nabove base change property we get the following result.\n(2) Proposition ([13, 3.4]) The R-scheme X\u03a3 (R) \u2192 Spec(R) is separated, quasicompact, flat, and of finite presentation; it is faithfully flat if and only if \u03a3 6= \u2205\nor R = 0.\nIn contrast, a lot of other basic properties are respected and reflected by X\u03a3 .\nThe following statements are proved by reducing to the affine case, i.e. X\u03c3 , and\nthen applying corresponding results about algebras of monoids (see e.g. [6]).\n(3) Proposition ([13, 3.4]) a) The scheme X\u03a3 (R) is reduced, connected, or normal if and only if R is so or \u03a3 = \u2205; it is irreducible, or integral if and only if R is\nso and \u03a3 6= \u2205.\nb) If \u03a3 6= \u2205 then there is a bijection p 7\u2192 X\u03a3 (R/p) from the set of minimal\nprime ideals of R to the set of irreducible components of X\u03a3 (R).\nc) The scheme X\u03a3 (R) is Noetherian if and only if R is so or \u03a3 = \u2205; it is Artinian\nif and only if R is so and n = 0, or R = 0, or \u03a3 = \u2205.\nd) If \u03a3 6= \u2205 then\ndim(R) + n \u2264 dim(X\u03a3 (R)) \u2264 (n + 1) dim(R) + n;\nif R is moreover Noetherian then dim(R) + n = dim(X\u03a3 (R)).\ne) If R is Noetherian, then X\u03a3 (R) is equidimensional if and only if R is so or\n\u03a3 = \u2205.\nThe above shows in particular that on general toric schemes no satisfying theory\nof Weil divisors is available. Since a lot of results about toric varieties were proved\nby heavy use of Weil divisor techniques (see e.g. [2], [5]), one has to come up with\nnew proofs in order to generalise these results to toric schemes.\nFinally, as an example of a property depending on the fan but not on the base ring\nwe consider properness. Its characterisation needs the notion of a complete N -fan\nS\n\u03a3, i.e. an N -fan \u03a3 with \u03a3 = V . This result is well-known for toric varieties (see\ne.g. [5, 2.4]), and proved on use of torus operations for toric schemes associated with\nregular fans in [3, \u00a74 Proposition 4]. Our proof for arbitrary fans avoids speaking\nof torus operations and relies only on the valuative criterion for properness and on\nproperties of projections of fans proved in [12].\n(4) Proposition The R-scheme X\u03a3 (R) \u2192 Spec(R) is proper if and only if \u03a3 is\ncomplete, or \u03a3 = \u2205, or R = 0.\n2. Sheaves on toric schemes\nGeneralising work by Cox [2] and Musta\u0163\u01ce [10] we introduce a notion of Cox\nring (not to be confused with the one introduced in [8]) and describe quasicoherent\nmodules on toric schemes in terms of graded modules over these rings. In order to\ndo so we need to define some objects encoding the combinatorics of the fan \u03a3.\n\n\f4\n\nFRED ROHRER\n\nLet \u03a31 denote the set of 1-dimensional cones in \u03a3.

Moreover, for \u03c4 4 \u03c3 there is a canonical morphism of rings S(\u03c3) \u2192 S(\u03c4 ) which\nis independent of m and B. Taking spectra and setting Y(\u03c3) (R) := Spec(S(\u03c3) ) for\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 we obtain an inductive system (Y\u03c3 (R))\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 of R-schemes over \u03a3. Its inductive\nlimit exists and is an R-scheme denoted by Y\u03a3 (R) \u2192 Spec(R) and called the Cox\nscheme over R associated with \u03a3 (and N ). It can be understood as obtained by\nglueing (Y\u03c3 (R))\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 along (Y\u03c3\u2229\u03c4 (R))(\u03c3,\u03c4 )\u2208\u03a32 .\nThe above construction of Cox schemes gives rise to a contravariant functor Y\u03a3\nfrom the category of rings to the category of schemes together with a morphism\nY\u03a3 \u2192 Spec, and Y\u03a3 is compatible with base change in the sense of (1).\nCox schemes are closely related to toric schemes as follows. The morphism of\ngroups c : M \u2192 \u03a31 induces morphisms of rings R[\u03c3 \u2228 \u2229 M ] \u2192 S(\u03c3) for \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3, and\nthese induce a canonical morphism of contravariant functors \u03b3 : Y\u03a3 \u2192 X\u03a3 . Then,\nwe have the following result.\n\nZ\n\n(5) Proposition ([14, 3.3.3]) The canonical morphism of contravariant functors\n\u03b3 : Y\u03a3 \u2192 X\u03a3 is an isomorphism if and only if \u03a3 is full.\nUsing the (non-canonical) procedure to consider a toric scheme associated with\na non-full fan as a toric scheme associated with a full fan ([13, 3.3]) it is sufficient to\nstudy from now on Cox schemes instead of toric schemes. (Note that this reduction\ndemands a base change and is in general not available for toric varieties.)\nNow we are ready to explain how B-graded SB -modules give rise to quasicoherent\nsheaves on Y\u03a3 (R). We denote by GrModB (SB ) and QCMod(OY\u03a3 (R) ) the categories\n\n\fON TORIC SCHEMES\n\n5\n\nof B-graded SB -modules and of quasicoherent OY\u03a3 (R) -modules. Moreover, for a Bgraded SB -module F we denote by F(\u03c3) the component of degree 0 of the B-graded\nmodule of fractions FZbm = F \u2297SB (SB )Zbm , and for an S(\u03c3) -module G we denote by\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\ne the OY (R) -module associated with G.\nG\n\u03c3\n\n(6) Proposition ([14, 4.1.1]) There exists a unique functor\nSB : GrModB (SB ) \u2192 QCMod(OY\u03a3 (R) )\n\nwith SB (F ) \u21beY\u03c3 (R) = Fg\n(\u03c3) for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 and every B-graded SB -module F .\nSince SB coincides locally with the canonical equivalence between modules and\nquasicoherent sheaves on affine schemes it is exact and commutes with inductive\nlimits. Furthermore, denoting by \u2022(\u03b1) the functor of shifting degrees by \u03b1, we can\nconstruct a right quasiinverse\nM\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0393B\n\u0393 Y\u03a3 (R), \u2022 \u2297OY\u03a3 (R) SB (SB (\u03b1))\n\u2217 (\u2022) :=\n\u03b1\u2208B\n\nfor SB , called the first total functor of sections associated with \u03a3 and B over R.\nThus, we get the following generalisation of [10, Theorem 1.1], itself a generalisation\nof [2, Theorem 3.2].\n(7) Theorem ([14, 4.4.3]) The functor SB : GrModB (SB ) \u2192 QCMod(OY\u03a3 (R) ) is\nessentially surjective.\nNext, we restrict our attention to ideals. A graded ideal a \u2286 SB is called IB S\nk\ne denote the sets of IB -saturated\nsaturated if a = k\u2208N0 (a :SB IB\n). Let sat\nB and\ngraded ideals of SB and of quasicoherent ideals of OY\u03a3 (R) , respectively. Then, SB\ne . The next result treats the question\ninduces by exactness a map \u039eB : sat\nB \u2192\nwhether this map is surjective or injective. To get injectivity, besides being big the\nsubgroup B must not be \"too big\". More precisely, B is called small (with respect\nT\nto \u03a3) if it is contained in \u03c3\u2208\u03a3 h{\u03b1\u03c1 | \u03c1 \u2208 \u03a31 \\ \u03c31 }iZ .\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n(8) Theorem ([14, 4.4.9]) The map \u039eB :\nthen it is bijective.\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\ne\nJsat\nB \u2192 J is surjective, and if B is small\n\nAn example of a subgroup that is big and small (and moreover well understood)\nis given in the following remark (cf. [4, V.5]).\nConsider a family (U\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 of subsets of V \u2217 such that for every \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 there exists\na (not necessarily unique) m\u03c3 \u2208 M with U\u03c3 = m\u03c3 + \u03c3 \u2228 . Such a family is called a\nvirtual polytope over \u03a3 if \u03c4 \u2286 Ker(m\u03c3 \u2212 m\u03c4 ) for all \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a3 with \u03c4 4 \u03c3, and this\ncondition is independent of the choice of the family (m\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 . There is a canonical\nstructure of group on the set of virtual polytopes over \u03a3, and the set of virtual\npolytopes of the form (m + \u03c3 \u2228 )\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 is a subgroup. The corresponding quotient\ngroup is denoted by Pic(\u03a3) and called the Picard group of \u03a3. It can be considered\nas the group of virtual polytopes over \u03a3 modulo M -rational translations.\nThe map\n(m\u03c3 + \u03c3 \u2228 )\u03c3\u2208\u03a3 7\u2192 (m\u03c1 (\u03c1N ))\u03c1\u2208\u03a31\n\nZ\n\nyields a monomorphism from the group of virtual polytopes over \u03a3 to \u03a31 , and\nthis induces a monomorphism Pic(\u03a3) \u058c A by means of which we consider Pic(\u03a3)\nas a subgroup of A. Then, Pic(\u03a3) is small, and if \u03a3 is simplicial then Pic(\u03a3) is big.\nHence, it provides an example of a subgroup of A to which (8) can be applied.\n\n\f6\n\nFRED ROHRER\n\nC\n\nFinally, since Pic(\u03a3) \u223c\n= Pic(X\u03a3 ( )) by [4, Theorem VII.2.15] we get back [2,\nCorollary 3.9] as a special case.\n3. Cohomology on toric schemes\nOur results about quasicoherent sheaves in the last section reveals that toric\nschemes (or more precisely, Cox schemes) are very similar to projective schemes.\nHence, we ask if there is a toric version of the Serre-Grothendieck correspondence\n(cf. [1, 20.4.4]), relating cohomology of quasicoherent sheaves on a Cox scheme to\ngraded local cohomology of B-graded SB -modules with respect to the irrelevant\nideal IB . This is indeed the case.\nFirst, we have to explain what we mean by graded local cohomology. We denote\nby\nB\n\n\u0393IB : GrModB (SB ) \u2192 GrModB (SB )\n\nthe B-graded IB -torsion functor. Its right derived cohomological functor is denoted\nby (B HIiB )i\u2208Z and called B-graded local cohomology with respect to IB . The reason\nfor this clumsy notation is that the ungraded module underlying a graded local\ncohomology module of a graded module F might not be the same as the local\ncohomology module of the ungraded module underlying F . (A sufficient condition\nfor this to hold is coherence of the graded ring SB .)\nNext, we introduce a variant of sheaf cohomology that is useful for our purpose.\nWe define a functor\nB\nB\n\u0393B\n\u2217\u2217 (\u2022) : GrMod (SB ) \u2192 GrMod (SB ),\n\ncalled the second total functor of sections associated with \u03a3 and B over R, by\nsetting\nM\n\u0393B\n\u0393(Y\u03a3 (R), SB (\u2022(\u03b1))).\n\u2217\u2217 (\u2022) :=\n\u03b1\u2208B\n\nNote that despite its name it is defined on the category GrModB (SB ). However, by\n(7) this is merely a technical point. The reason for two (in general different) total\nfunctors of sections is that the canonical morphism\nSB (\u2022) \u2297OY\u03a3 (R) SB (SB (\u03b1)) \u2192 SB (\u2022(\u03b1))\nis not necessarily an isomorphism. The right derived cohomological functor of\ni\n\u0393B\n\u2217\u2217 (\u2022) is denoted by (H\u2217\u2217,B )i\u2208Z and contains the usual sheaf cohomology as a\ndirect summand.\nTo go on we need a certain behaviour of injectives in the category GrModB (SB ).\nNamely, the B-graded ring SB is said to have the ITR-property with respect to IB\nif every B-graded IB -torsion SB -module has an injective resolution whose components are B-graded IB -torsion SB -modules. This is fulfilled for example if SB is\nNoetherian (as a graded ring), and in particular if R is Noetherian. Using this\nnotion and imitating the corresponding proof in the projective case we arrive at the\nToric Serre-Grothendieck Correspondence.\n(9) Theorem ([14, 4.5.4]) If SB has the ITR-property with respect to IB , then\nthere exist an exact sequence of functors\n\u03b6B\n\nB 1\n0 \u2212\u2192 B \u0393IB \u2212\u2192 IdGrModB (SB ) \u2212\u2192 \u0393B\n\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2192 HIB \u2212\u2192 0\n\n\fON TORIC SCHEMES\n\nand a unique morphism of \u03b4-functors\ni\ni\n(\u03b6B\n)i\u2208Z : H\u2217\u2217,B\n\n\u0001\n\ni\u2208\n\nZ \u2212\u2192\n\nB\n\n7\n\nHIi+1\nB\n\n0\ni\nwith \u03b6B\n= \u03b6B , and \u03b6B\nis an isomorphism for every i \u2208\n\n\u0001\n\ni\u2208\n\nN.\n\nZ\n\nAs an application we can prove a toric version of Serre's Finiteness Theorem.\n(10) Proposition ([14, 4.5.5]) Let F be a finitely generated B-graded SB -module,\nand suppose that \u03a3 is complete and that R is Noetherian. Then, the R-modules\ni\nH\u2217\u2217,B\n(F )\u03b1 and B HIiB (F )\u03b1 are finitely generated for every i \u2208 and every \u03b1 \u2208 B.\n\nZ\n\nConsidering the fibres of a toric scheme, this allows us to define and investigate\nHilbert functions of toric schemes, a task we would like to address in future research. Note that the above hypothesis of a complete fan \u03a3 can be achieved by the\nCompletion Theorem ([12]).\nReferences\n[1]\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nM.
