Design of the Study\n\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\n\nIn our study we build a ranking based on the interlinking structure\nof the German university websites. In the following we compare\nthis simple pure-webometric ranking with some official rankings\nthat are based on web-independent indicators (compare with\nFig.4).\n\nH.5.4 [INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION (I.7)]: Hypertext/Hypermedia - User issues.\n\n2.1 Building a pure-webometric ranking\n\nGeneral Terms\nMeasurement, Experimentation, Human Factors, Verification\n\nKeywords\nWebometrics, link analysis,\nwebsites, correlation\n\nuniversity ranking,\n\nacademic\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nInterlinking data is a fascinating new data source for the analysis\nof web phenomena and a feasible starting point to build a better\nunderstanding of the Web [1],[6]. In this paper we compare\nmethodologically different approaches to rank universities. For\nour case study we analyzed subsets of German universities. We\ncompare two purely webometric approaches which are based on\ninterlinking/web data of university websites with traditional\napproaches which take into account e.g. judgments of students,\nprofessors and staff, publication data and other data sources .\nThe idea of the paper is to analyze whether there is a correlation\nbetween these different approaches to rank universities. On the\nlong hand we try to figure out if we can use the socio-technical\nproperties of the Web (explicated often via web links) as a proper\ndata source for Web Science analysis.\nBeside their functional role, hyperlinks can be understood as a\nconceptual reference to the content they are linking to. The\nquestion is: Is this kind of non-functional meaning somehow\nmeasurable?\nOur assumption was:\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nuniversity websites are linking to academic and research\ncontent; so we have a significant number of non-functional\nlinks in the academic web,\nimportant research topics increase both, the prestige of the\nuniversity as well as the number of links referring to it.\n\nIf there is a positive correlation between the prestige of an\nuniversity and its inlinks, it could be seen as an effect of this non-\n\nSearch engines offer the possibility to ask for all links between\ntwo web domains [2]. Suppose a and b are websites, the search\ncommand e.g. \"linkdomain:a site:b\" offers the hit count estimates\nof all inlinks to a from b. The search command in a search engine\nwill return results for all pages within the top level domains a and\nb. To obtain a number of all in- and outlinks for a list of domain\nnames, all possible pairs of domains have to be queried. Thus we\nfirst took a list of domain names from German universities1 to ask\nYahoo for the number of links between each possible pair [2].\nTherefore we used a freely available tool called LexiUrl. 2 LexiUrl\nautomatically generates the necessary list of queries for a certain\nsearch engine from a simple list of domain names. As a result\nLexiUrl provides a link network graph that easily can be used\nwith Pajek (see Fig. 3).3 Pajek also generates a flat file, which\ncontains all inlink amounts for each query. In addition we consult\nthe centrality degrees closeness and hubs-authorities to build\nsimple variants of graph based rankings. These two rankings are\nbased on the respective centrality of each node as it can be\ncalculated with Pajek.\nOnce we have all results \u2013 the hit count estimates from Yahoo as\nwell as the network degrees from the resulting network graph - we\nput them into a database. Now we were able to create our own\nrankings, as we have counted all the links, either grouped by in- or\noutgoing domain name.\n\n2.2 Comparison with official rankings\nOne of the official rankings we want to correlate with is from the\nCentre for Higher Education (CHE), an institute funded by the\nBertelsmann Foundation.4 CHE is a ranking of German-speaking\n1\n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Hochschulen_in_Deutsc\nhland\n2\n\nLexiUrl software: http://lexiurl.wlv.ac.uk/\n\n3\n\nPajekt: http://pajek.imfm.si\n\n4\n\nwww.che.de\n\n\funiversity institutes with the primary purpose to guide freshman\nstudents in choosing the best place for their scholarly education.\nIts data is collected through questionnaires administered to\nmembers of departments or faculties, professors, students as well\nas on bibliometric analyses of the publications. CHE presents the\nuniversity rankings for each discipline separately. Although CHE\nindicates that the data actually does not allow an overall\ncomparison of all universities within all disciplines, we do think\nthat comparing an overall summary of web-independent CHE data\nwith our link based data is still useful. In order to receive a\ncomplete ranking we wrote a little program that reads the HTML\nfrom the CHE websites and transforms the colour coded judgment\nof each rank position in a calculable number. After we had done\nthat for each discipline, we normalized all data with respect to the\nnumber of judgments per university.\nWith the so called Shanghai Ranking5 we took another multiindicator and web-independent university ranking into account.\nThe ranking compares institutions worldwide according to a\nformula that includes alumni winning Nobel Prizes and Fields\nMedals, highly-cited researchers, articles published in famous\njournals and the per capita academic performance of an\ninstitution.\nIn addition we consult a pure webometric ranking, called\nWebometric Ranking of World Universities.6 The ranking\ncombines four indicators including the size of the pages, the\nnumber of inlinks, differentiation between filetypes and the\nnumber of papers cited by Google Scholar. Both rankings,\nShanghai as well as the Webometric Ranking, are global rankings\nfrom which we took only the ranking positions of German\nuniversities. At last we simply asked Google for the general inlink\namount of each domain-name (see last column of Fig.1). Again\nthis data was put into the database.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient is shown in the table below\n(see Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2: Correlation of university rankings (Pearson\ncorrelation)\nThere are only three noteworthy correlations. First of all, that is\nthe correlation between the Webometrics and the Shanghai\nranking (p=0.55). Furthermore there are two strong positive\ncorrelations between the centrality degrees - closeness (p=0.84)\nand the combined hubs-authorities (p=0.88) value - and the inand outlink amount. Since the two ranges were taken from the\nsame graph (see Fig. 3), they must have a good correlation, as the\nnumber of in- and outlinks and centrality measures are not\nindependent of each other. These correlations, however, say little\nabout the relationship of the graph with the other rankings and\nwill therefore not be further interpreted. All other measurement\nparameters are close to zero or negativ.\n\nAfter storing every ranking value into the database we compared\neach pair with the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n3. Results\nAfter adjusting our data of some undesirable effects (some are\ndiscussed below), we finally got 91 nodes of universities and\n30,094 edges (see Fig. 3). We compared each ranking with each\nother using the Pearson correlation coefficient.7\nThe correlations differ in the number and selection of ranked\nuniversities. The following table indicates the amount of\ncorrelated universities (see Fig. 1. Caption below).\n\nFigure 1: Total amount of correlated universities\nWebometrics\nShanghai\nCHE\nInlinks\n\nWT\nSH\nCH\nIL\n\nOutlinks\nCloseness\nAuthorities &Hubs\nGoogle\n\nOL\nCS\nAH\nGG\n\n5\n\nhttp://www.arwu.org/ARWU2010.jsp\n\n6\n\nhttp://www.webometrics.info\n\n7\n\nWe also tried Spearman's correlation coefficient with a similar\nresult.\n\nFigure 3: Adjusted interlinking graph of university websites in\nGermany with 30,094 links from finally 91 universities. The\nsize of nodes depends on the number of websites per domain.\n\n4. Discussion\nApart from the rankings Webometrics and Shanghai (p=0.55)\nthere are no obvious correlations in our data. That means in\ngeneral, hyperlinks cannot easily be used as ranking indicators for\nacademic website in this simplistic way.. Obviously the objective\nof hyperlinking is more complex. Deriving indicators directly\nfrom the Web is not that simple due to a multitude of motivations\nto create hyperlinks. Although we have adjusted our data from\n\n\fsuch obvious cases, we are not sure whether there exist some\nmore.\nWhen preparing the data, we quickly came across a general\nproblem of link analysis. A certain set of significant highly linked\nuniversity pages owes this position due to a purely technical\naspect. E.g. the university website of Kassel was in a top position\nbecause it was referenced by the website of Marburg, Giessen and\nMainz due to technical links from a content management system.\nAll stylesheets, scripts, images are referencing the domain name\nof Kassel. Those links are counted although the motivation of\ncreation was obviously not a conceptual reference to the content\nof Kassel.\nDoes that mean hyperlinks do not have a conceptual meaning as it\nis assumed above? In our opinion, hyperlinks cannot be\nunderstood simply as a measure of appreciation of the linked\nresource. The reasons for the existence of a hyperlink are too\nmultifunctional [3]. However, we still think that hyperlinks\nrepresent prestige in web infrastructures but in our restricted case\nstudy with German university website, we cannot observe these\nprestige differences expressed via simple link counts. In addition\nhyperlinks need to be classified, at least to distinguish between\npure functional and substantive meaning. There have already been\nmade some efforts on general link classification. Thelwall [3] and\nStuart [4] for example are using a distinction made on the\nobjectives of a link to introduce a general typology of hyperlinks.\nThis approach might have produced a better correlation between\nthe number of meaningful inlinks and a ranking position\nestablished by any web-independent method.\nBasically, there exist fundamental problems in the underlying\nservices provided by public search engines [7]. The reason why\nwe have used Yahoo instead of Google is that Google has stopped\nits service in late 2010. Since April 2011, Yahoo has also\nprevented the ability to query linking amounts via the search\nengine.\n\nfocused crawls. As our example with the technical links to the\nKassel university website shows, it should be possible to roughly\nassess from which part of an HTML page a link is received from.\nIn order to avoid those problems and to be able to classify\nhyperlinks before counting in the future, we will replace LexiURL\nwith a complete crawl of the university websites.\n\n5.
