With a help of hydrodynamical models, we explore fundamental modes of gas flow in central parts of a galaxy potential with\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations of various strengths. Our grid-based algorithm allows us to get a detailed picture of gas dynamics down to about\n10 pc from the galaxy center, where the central black hole becomes dominant. Gas inflow in a bar with an Inner Lindblad Resonance often stops\nat the nuclear ring. We find that embedded bars in resonant coupling are\nunlikely to increase the inflow, but for certain gas parameters in a single\nbar, inflow to the center develops in a spiral shock, similar to the patterns\nobserved in nuclear discs of real galaxies. The spiral pattern persists for\nvery weak non-axisymmetries of the potential.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nInterstellar gas falls towards the center of a galaxy if torques act on it and remove\nits angular momentum. On scales larger than several parsecs, gravitational\ntorques from non-axisymmetric mass distribution in stars dominate. They can\nbe caused by external factors (interactions and mergers) or internal ones (bars\nand other results of disk instabilities). Here, we focus on gas flow in barred\ngalactic potentials: if the bar is strong enough, the x1 orbits aligned with it\ndevelop cusps at their apocenters, and gas clouds there run onto each other,\ncausing shocks. The shocked gas loses angular momentum to the bar, and a\nconsiderable inflow occurs at radii where shocks are present. In a bar with an\nInner Lindblad Resonance (ILR), orbiting gas shifts gradually from x1 to x2\norbits, and eventually settles in a nuclear ring, located approximately at the\nbar's ILR, at a radius of order 1 kpc.\nAccumulation of gas in the nuclear ring may trigger a nuclear starburst, but\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) require mass accretion to within a few parsecs of\nthe galaxy center. A mechanism of bars within bars has been proposed to drive\nfurther inflow, and thus feed the AGN in a manner similar to the inflow on large\nscales (Shlosman, Frank & Begelman 1989). In its original form, it involved\na cascade of nested, independently rotating gaseous bars, with the inner bar\nforming as a result of dynamical instability in the gaseous nuclear disk. Such\ninstability develops rapidly, and may cause a significant inflow, but one should\nnot expect well-ordered flow morphology there. On the other hand, bars within\nbars observed in the stellar component of galaxies are likely to be of different\n1\n\n\f2\nnature: even if they form as an effect of gravitational instability, their motion is\nwell-ordered, and their lifetime longer.\nHere we present some preliminary results on fundamental modes of gas flow\nin strong single and double bars, and in weak oval distortions, and we examine\nhow efficient they can be in feeding the nucleus. We give a comprehensive\naccount of this work elsewhere (Maciejewski et al. 2001).\n2.\n\nNumerical code, potential and initial conditions\n\nWe used the grid-based Eulerian hydrodynamical code CMHOG, written by\nJames M. Stone at the University of Maryland and adopted to the polar grid\nin two dimensions, with isothermal equation of state, by Piner et al. (1995).\nThe code implements the piecewise parabolic method (PPM), and the use of\nsquare cells gives high resolution at the center: up to 0.4 pc at the radius of 20\npc. Self-gravity of gas is neglected, and the numerical viscosity is very low -\nthe infall to the center is negligible in an axisymmetric potential for timescales\nconsidered here.\nThe grid extends from 20 or 100 pc to 16 kpc in radius, and the gas flow\nis followed in a potential of Model 2 of a doubly barred galaxy constructed by\nMaciejewski & Sparke (2000). Azimuthal averaging of the secondary bar gives\nour potential of a singly-barred galaxy. The semi-major axis of the main bar\nis 6 kpc with a rotation period of 0.171 Gyr; the corresponding values for the\nsecondary bar are 1.2 kpc and 0.056 Gyr. Gas is initially distributed uniformly\nover the grid, and forced to rotate around the center with the circular velocity in\nthe azimuthally averaged potential. Then the outer bar of Model 2 is introduced\nby gradual transfer of mass from the bulge. In runs with double bars, the\nsecondary bar is introduced in the same way, after the flow in the primary bar\nhas stabilized.\n3.\n\nGas inflow in single and double bar compared\n\nGeneral features of gas flow in a single strong, fast-rotating bar with two ILRs\ncan be seen in Fig.1, with shocks showing up best in the square of velocity\ndivergence in the gas (div2 v, div v < 0). Gas loses angular momentum in the\nprincipal shocks (PS) along the leading sides of the bar and falls towards the\ncenter. Inside the ILR (i.e. between the inner and outer ILR) a gaseous nuclear\nring (NR) forms, and the inflow stagnates there, with star formation likely. A\nweak spiral density wave propagates inwards from the nuclear ring, but the rate\nof gas inflow to the center is very small: less than 10\u22124 M\u2299 /yr.\nBy extending the concept of multiple gaseous bars proposed by Shlosman\net al. (1989) to the stellar bars, it is thought that the secondary bar may force\ngas deeper into the potential well, if gas flow in the secondary bar is analogous\nto the one above. To verify this view, Maciejewski & Sparke (2000) constructed\na model of a dynamically possible doubly barred galaxy. They started with\nthe potentials of two rigid, independently rotating bars embedded in a disk and\nhalo, and searched for particle distributions that could support the assumed\npotential. Despite the absence of a conserved Jacobi integral in this system,\nthe orbits are not mostly chaotic. Particle motions appear well-ordered, if one\n\n\f.\n\n.\n\n3\n\n.\n\nFigure 1.\nDensity (left), and div 2 v (right) snapshots of gas flow in a\nsingle bar at time 1 Gyr. The bar is outlined in solid, and the dotted\ncurves mark the inner ILR at 0.13 kpc, the outer ILR at 2.14 kpc, and\ncorotation at 7.78 kpc. Gas velocity in the frame rotating with the bar\nis marked by arrows. Positions of the principal shock (PS), nuclear ring\n(NR), spiral shock (SS), and the convergence region (C) are marked.\nUnits on axes are in kpc.\nlooks not at orbits, but at sets of particles forming closed curves which return\nto their original position after two bars realign. These sets (called here loops)\nare equivalent to orbits in a time-independent potential.\nIn a doubly barred system there are loops that follow the outer bar in its\nmotion, and other ones that follow the inner bar. In the model with resonant\ncoupling (corotation of the small bar matches the outer ILR of the main one)\nthat we consider here, loops supporting the secondary bar in its motion do not\nextend out to the outer ILR of the main bar, forcing the secondary bar to end well\ninside its corotation. The requirement of self-consistency puts strict limits on\nparameters of acceptable double bars, and rules out many hypothetical doublybarred systems as being far from self-consistent. It is essential to examine gas\nflows in a dynamically possible model: modeling gas flows in arbitrary potentials\nof double bars may be misleading, as we do not know if such double bars can\nexist.\nFig.2 shows that outer regions of gas flow remain unaffected by the introduction of the secondary bar: the principal shock retains its shape and position.\nThe secondary bar affects the central regions most strongly, but no stationary\nstraight dust lanes form there. Rather, the flow organizes into various elliptical\nand circular rings, with mass accumulating first at the twin peaks at the ends\nof the secondary bar, and then settling in an inner elliptical ring. Gas inflow to\nthe center remains very small: it averages about 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 /yr.\nIt is easy to understand this modeled flow in terms of the underlying orbital\nstructure. In a double bar gas stays around stable loops, and loops supporting\nthe secondary bar end well inside its corotation. However, straight shocks form\nonly in a bar extending almost to its corotation (i.e. fast bar, Athanassoula\n\n\f.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n4\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFigure 2.\nThree snapshots of gas flow in the model of a doubly barred\ngalaxy, with density on the top and div 2 v on the bottom. The times are\n0.695 Gyr (left), 0.780 Gyr (middle), and 2 Gyr (right). The primary\nbar is always vertical, and the secondary bar is outlined by the solid\nline. Dotted lines indicate (innermost out) positions of the inner ILR\nof the main bar, the maximum of the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba/2 curve at 0.55 kpc (where\nthe secondary bar is close to having an ILR), the outer ILR of the main\nbar, and corotation of the secondary bar at 2.19 kpc.\n1992). Therefore, what would be a straight shock in a fast bar, here curls and\nforms a ring instead. Also, no loops corresponding to x2 orbits in the secondary\nbar have been found, thus one should not expect offset shocks. Finally, loops\nsupporting the secondary bar originate from the x2 orbits in the main bar -\nthey are rather round, with no cusps, so there is no reason for shocks in the\ngas flow to develop. Thus, some self-consistent doubly barred galaxies may lack\nprincipal shocks and dust lanes, and double bars may not provide an efficient\nmechanism for fueling gas into the galactic center. Observations support this\nfinding: infrared color maps of Seyfert galaxy centers (Regan & Mulchaey 1999)\nshow no symmetric straight dust lanes unrelated to the main bar, and the only\ndoubly barred galaxy in the sample (NGC 3081) differs from the rest by having\na central ring flattened along the secondary bar.\n4.\n\nFeeding the nucleus with a dynamically warm dissipative medium\n\nRegan & Mulchaey (1999) and Martini & Pogge (1999) report an unexpectedly\nhigh frequency of nuclear spiral patterns in their samples of Seyfert 2 galaxies.\n\n\f5\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFigure 3.\nDensity (left) and div 2 v (middle and right) plots of gas\nflow in the inner regions of a single-bar model with gas sound speed 20\nkm s\u22121 . The left and middle snapshots are taken at 0.195 Gyr, and\nthe right one at 0.135 Gyr, just before the shock crosses the inner grid\nboundary.\nEnglmaier & Shlosman (2000) found nuclear spirals in their models for some\ncombinations of the potential and gas sound speed. Their spirals are weak and\ncan be described by a linear wave theory.\nWe modeled gas flow in the same singly-barred potential as in Fig.1, with\nthe sound speed in gas increased from 5 to 20 km s\u22121 . Although the principal\nshock persists, the nuclear ring is replaced by a nuclear spiral (Fig.3), with div 2 v\nhalf that of the principal shock: in this model, gas falls towards the center in\na spiral shock. Our potential has an inner ILR, but the shock extends further\ninwards, reaching the inner grid boundary at the 20 pc radius. The inflow to\nthe center is very large, up to 0.15 M\u2299 /yr, which is enough to power a weak\nAGN, although the evolution after the shock crosses the grid boundary should\nbe interpreted with caution.\n5.\n\nGas inflow in a weak bar\n\nWe investigated how much the strong inflow for high sound speed decreases if\nwe weaken the bar. A new potential was set up, differing from the one above\nby the quadrupole moment of the bar being 10 times smaller, and the bar's\naxial ratio lowered from 2.5 to 1.5. Although no feature similar to the straight\nprincipal shocks in a strong bar is present in the flow, a nuclear spiral still forms\ninside the ILR (Fig.4, left). One should expect a flow like this, since the x1\norbits supporting the weak bar in this model are round, with no cusps, and thus\ndo not induce shocks in gas. Inside the ILR, as in the strong bar, gas on x1\nand x2 orbits interacts, giving rise to the spiral structure. The arm-interarm\ndensity contrast of the spiral is much lower than in the case of a strong bar, and\nlinear theory is sufficient to describe the gas flow: the spiral pattern does not\nextend to the galaxy center (Fig.4, center). Adding a central black hole (or mass\nconcentration) removes the inner ILR, and allows the spiral pattern extend to\nthe center (Fig.4, right). Surprisingly, this does not increase the inflow, which\nis small in both cases - below 0.005 M\u2299 /yr.\n\n\f6\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFigure 4.\nGas flow in the inner regions of a weak single-bar model\nwith density in greyscale. The left and middle plots are for the potential\nwith an inner ILR, the plot on the right is for a potential with a 108\nM\u2299 central black hole, which removes the inner ILR. The weak bar is\noutlined in solid, and dotted curves mark the same resonances as in\nFig.1.\n6.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have investigated basic modes of gas flow in the central parts of galaxies by\nfocusing on isothermal, non-selfgravitating fluid in an external potential. Later\non, one can add other physical mechanisms (self-gravity, star formation, magnetic fields) which will build on this picture, and avoid confusion often caused\nby heuristic explanations that include many physical mechanisms in a simplified\nway.\nIn the fixed potential of a single bar, various modes of gas flow can develop,\nsome of which are able to sustain the fueling of an AGN. In a mode with low\nsound speed, a single strong bar with an ILR can be very inefficient in feeding\nthe nucleus. Adding an embedded secondary bar may not increase the inflow,\nbut if the sound speed in the nuclear gas is high, a spiral shock develops in a\nsingle strong bar, resulting in an inflow large enough to feed an AGN. The shock\nin a strong bar corresponds to a nuclear spiral in a weak bar, but gas inflow there\nis too small to feed an AGN.\nReferences\nAthanassoula E., 1992, MNRAS, 259, 328\nEnglmaier P., Shlosman I., 2000, ApJ, 528, 677\nMaciejewski W., Sparke L.S., 2000, MNRAS, 313, 745\nMaciejewski W., Teuben P., Sparke L., Stone, J., 2001, MNRAS, submitted\nMartini P., Pogge R.W., 1999, AJ, 118, 2646\nPiner B.G., Stone J.M., Teuben P.J., 1995, ApJ, 449, 508\nRegan M.W., Mulchaey J.S., 1999, AJ, 117, 2676\nShlosman I., Frank J., Begelman M., 1989, Nature, 338, 45\n\n\f"}
