In a seminal set of\nworks (see the review1 ), Altshuler and Aronov studied the effects of the interplay of interaction and disorder on\nconductivity and tunneling density of states in the diffusive regime characterized by the condition 2\u03c0T \u03c4 \u226a 1, where\n\u03c4 is the transport mean free time (we set kB = ~ = 1). Their results were generalized within the framework of\nthe renormalization group (RG) by Finkelstein2 . The last decade has witnessed a renewed increase of activity in\nthis field, largely motivated by experiments on an apparent metal-insulator transition in 2D systems. This interest\nwas triggered by experiments3 which showed a \"metallic\" behavior (decrease of resistivity with lowering T ) in highmobility Si structures. Later, qualitatively similar behavior was observed in a variety of high-mobility 2D systems,\nsee Refs. 4,5,6,7 for reviews.\nThe metallic behavior has been attributed to the effects of the electron-electron interaction in the ballistic temperature range, 2\u03c0T \u03c4 \u226b 1. These effects were originally considered in the framework of the temperature-dependent\nscreening8 . More recently, a systematic theory was developed, taking into account also exchange contributions and\nthe effects of both parallel and transverse magnetic fields, and valid in the whole range of T from the diffusive to\nthe ballistic regime9,10 . Another mechanism that can explain the metallic behavior of resistivity in an intermediate\ntemperature range in the diffusive regime was studied within the RG framework in Ref. 11. It is applicable to systems\nwith more than one valley, such as silicon MOSFETs.\nDespite these successes of the theory, numerous experimental observations remain puzzling and wait for an explanation. In particular, it was found that the spin susceptibility, proportional to the product mg of the effective mass\nm and the g-factor, is strongly growing when the density approaches the value nc corresponding to the apparent\ntransition. This conclusion was drawn on the basis of several experimental methods, including the analysis of beating pattern of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations12,13,14,15 , the study of magnetoresistance16,17 in the parallel field, and\nmeasurement of thermodynamic magnetization18 ; see recent reviews19,20 .\nThe enhancement of susceptibility with lowering density, interpreted in a number of papers as its divergence at\nn = nc , has attracted a great deal of attention, since it might be an indicator of some phase transition that the\nsystem undergoes with a decrease of density. The interpretation of the data has remained, however, controversial. In\nparticular, it remained unclear whether the strong increase of spin susceptibility should be attributed to that of m or\nof g. This information is of crucial importance for understanding the nature of the possible transition.\nSeveral experimental approaches have been used to separate the behavior of the effective mass from that of the\ng-factor. In Refs. 21,22,23 a fit of the resistivity data to the theoretical formulas of Ref. 9 was used to find the\ninteraction constant F0\u03c3 , and thus the g-factor. The accuracy of this procedure is questionable, since the theory of\nRef. 9 neglects higher Fermi-liquid interaction constants and assumes isotropic impurity scattering. Another approach\nis based on thermodynamic measurements in strong magnetic field24 . However, the authors of this work were able\nto measure the effective mass in a very narrow interval of electron concentration only, so that the results are not too\ninformative. Also, a strong magnetic field is expected to influence strongly the characteristics of the electron liquid,\nso that the applicability of such measurements to the low-field properties is questionable. So, while most of the above\nmeasurements seem to indicate that it is the effective mass that is responsible for the strongly enhanced susceptibility,\n\n\f2\nan independent verification is clearly needed.\nA well known method for determination of the effective mass is based on the investigation of the temperature\ndependence of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdHO). It was applied to the present problem in Refs. 14,25. However,\nthe analysis of the SdHO data is complicated by the fact that both the effective mass and the elastic quantum scattering\ntime \u03c4q are T -dependent, in view of the combined effect of interaction and disorder. An unambiguous interpretation\nof experimental data requires14 a theoretical information on T -dependence of m and \u03c4q . A development of the\ncorresponding theory is the aim of the present paper.\nIn fact, a recent paper26 has made an important step in this direction. Specifically, it was shown in Ref. 26 that\nthe Lifshitz-Kosevich formalism27 , originally developed for the analysis of magnetooscillations in a 3D Fermi liquid,\nis also applicable in 2D in the regime where the oscillations are exponentially suppressed by temperature smearing or\ndisorder. (In the regime of strong oscillations, the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula in 2D should be modified, as was earlier\nshown in Ref. 28.) Another result of Ref. 26 is that the inelastic electron-electron relaxation does not contribute to the\ndamping of magnetooscillations (similarly to the earlier result of Ref. 29 for the case of electron-phonon scattering).\nThe authors of Ref. 26 then calculated the contribution to the damping induced by the interplay of interaction\nand disorder. Their theoretical treatment of the problem is, however, far from complete. First, they consider only\ndiagrams for the self-energy with one impurity-ladder vertex correction to the interaction line and discard diagrams\nwith no and with two vertex corrections. Second, they claim that the T -dependence of the oscillation damping rate\ncan be equivalently attributed either to the correction to the effective mass, or to the quantum scattering rate (Dingle\ntemperature). Furthermore, in the latter case their result for the T -dependence of \u03c4q is in contradiction with the\npicture of Friedel oscillations inducing a correction to the relaxation rate, which is linear in T and is governed by\nbackscattering9.\nIn addition to the above experimental motivation, the development of the theory of interaction effects on magnetooscillations in a disordered 2DEG represents a fundamental theoretical problem. Such a theory should complement\nthe recently developed theory of interaction effects in transport of 2D electrons in zero and non-quantizing magnetic\nfields9,10 . Let us emphasize a peculiar aspect of the present problem. The damping of oscillations is governed by the\nself-energy, which is a single-particle quantity. [Indeed, the relevant diagrams, see Sec II B below, are reminiscent\nof those for the tunneling density of states (DOS)]. Generally, the self-energy is not a gauge-invariant object. On\nthe other hand, the magnetization and the conductivity (magnetooscillations of which we would like to study) are\nobservable (and thus gauge-invariant) quantities. It is well known that the gauge-invariance is of crucial importance\nfor interaction-induced corrections; a difference between the results for conductivity and for tunneling DOS in the\ncase of Coulomb interaction1,2 serves as a nice illustration. It is thus a theoretical challenge to see how the gauge\ninvariance manifests itself in the magnetooscillation problem.\nThe outline of the article is as follows. The section II is devoted to presentation of the general formalism. In\nSec. III we apply it to calculate the interaction-induced contribution to the damping of magnetooscillations in the\ncase of short-range interaction. In Sec. IV we show how to extract from the above result the corrections to the effective\nmass and the quantum scattering time. We also perform a calculation of the correction to the scattering time based\non the picture of Friedel oscillations and demonstrate a complete agreement between the two approaches. In Sec. V we\ngeneralize our results to the case of Coulomb interaction. We also perform there a comparison with the calculation of\nRef. 26. Section VI summarizes our findings. Some technical details of our calculations are presented in Appendices.\nII.\nA.\n\nMAGNETOOSCILLATIONS: GENERAL FORMALISM\nDerivation of the formula for a decay of the oscillations\n\nWe begin by calculating the oscillatory part \u03a9osc of the thermodynamic potential \u03a9. From this quantity one can\nderive the oscillating contribution to the thermodynamic density of states\n\u2202nosc\n\u2202 2 \u03a9osc\n,\n=\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential, and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of magnetic susceptibility\n\u03c7osc = \u2212\n\n\u2202 2 \u03a9osc\n,\n\u2202B 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere B is a magnetic field. The main subject of our interest is the exponential damping factor of these magnetooscillations. For non-interacting electrons, the same exponential damping factor governs the magnitude of the Shubnikov \u2013\nde-Hass oscillations of the conductivity for the case of weak disorder potential in sufficiently weak magnetic field35,36 ,\n\n\f3\nwhere the self-consistent Born approximation35 (SCBA) is valid. As we are going to show, the interaction-induced\ncorrection to the damping factor of the thermodynamic density of states arises due to the renormalization of the effective mass and the quantum scattering time. Therefore these T -dependent corrections to the damping factor govern\nthe magnitude of the Shubnikov \u2013 de-Hass oscillations as well, similarly to the non-interacting case.\nOur starting point is the expression for the thermodynamic potential derived in the paper by Luttinger and Ward30\n\u03a9 = \u2212T Tr ln(\u2212G\u22121 ) \u2212 T Tr(G\u03a3) + \u03a9\u2032 .\n\n(3)\n\n\u22121\nG(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) = [G\u22121\n,\n0 (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) \u2212 \u03a3(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c )]\n\n(4)\n\nHere\n\nis the dressed Green's function in the Matsubara formalism, i\u03b5n = (2n + 1)i\u03c0T is the Matsubara fermionic energy, \u03c9c\nis the cyclotron frequency, and m is the Landau level index. Further,\nG0 (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) =\n\n1\ni\u03b5n + \u03bc \u2212 (m + 1/2)\u03c9c\n\nis the Green's function in the absence of disorder and interaction, and \u03a3(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) is a self-energy part of Green's\nfunction which includes all the disorder and interaction effects.\nThe trace in Eq. (3) implies summation over Matsubara frequencies \u03b5n and over Landau levels m. The logarithmic\nterm contains all the closed loop diagrams with insertion of self-energy (Fig. 1). The terms \u2212T Tr(G\u03a3) and \u03a9\u2032 are\nintroduced to avoid double-counting of diagrams30,31 . The term \u03a9\u2032 denotes the sum of all so-called skeleton diagrams\nwith all bare Green's functions replaced by dressed Green's functions (for the recent discussion of Luttinger-Ward\nformalism in 2D Fermi systems see Refs. 32,33).\nAs shown in Ref. 34, the exponential decay of magnetooscillations is described by the Tr ln-term. The oscillatory\nparts of the additional terms, which are introduced to fight overcounting, cancel each other. In order to obtain the\ncorrection to the thermodynamic potential we need to calculate the self-energy part of the Green's function.\nWe decompose the self-energy into two parts:\n\u03a3(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) = \u03a3dis (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) + \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ).\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a3dis (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) denotes the self-energy part due to the scattering on disorder potential with electron-electron\ninteraction switched off and \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) contains all the interaction effects.\nIn this paper we assume that disorder potential is \u03b4-correlated, inducing a large-angle scattering of electrons.

In the\nballistic regime, it follows from Eq. (8) that T \u226b 1/\u03c4 \u226b \u03c9c . The diffusive regime can be further split into two\nsubregimes: normal diffusive (\u03c9c \u226a T \u226a 1/\u03c4 ) and ultra-diffusive (T \u226a \u03c9c \u226a 1/\u03c4 ). When T \u226b \u03c9c , as in the\nballistic and normal diffusive regimes, only the first Matsubara frequency \u03b50 = \u03c0T in the sum determining A1 is\nrelevant, since the contribution of higher Matsubara frequencies are exponentially suppressed. On the other hand, in\nthe ultra-diffusive regime T \u226a \u03c9c and higher Matsubara frequencies contribute as well.\nIn what follows we concentrate on the case T \u226b \u03c9c .

We also note that the inelastic contribution to the selfenergy \u221d [(\u03c0T )2 \u2212 \u03b52n ] sgn \u03b5n (see Appendix B) vanishes for \u03b5n = \u03c0T, and thus does not affect the damping of the\nmagnetooscillations B(T ) for T \u226b \u03c9c , in agreement with Refs. 26,29.\nUsing the renormalized quantities in Eq.

III below. For the more realistic\ncase of the Coulomb interaction (Sec. V), the relevant higher-order terms can be treated using the random-phase\napproximation (RPA). Higher-order contributions to the T -dependent part of the self-energy, \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03c0T, \u03be0 ), are small\nin the parameter 1/EF \u03c4 or T /EF .\nLet us list important elements which are necessary for calculation of the interaction-induced part of the self-energy\n(Fig. 2). Each contribution to the self-energy has exchange and Hartree parts. We first address the exchange\ncontribution (the Hartree terms can be written in a similar way). It contains the angle-averaged Green's function\ncovered by the effective interaction line. The corresponding vertices may be dressed by impurity ladders (Fig. 3).\nNotice that the renormalized vertex includes at least one impurity line. Finally, when the interaction line changes the\nsigns of Matsubara frequencies at vertices, an additional diagram (we term it a \"Hikami-box diagram\") with a single\nimpurity line covering the whole block is to be included (Fig. 2b).\n\n\f6\nWe split \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) into three contributions, corresponding to different possibilities of dressing the two interaction\nvertices by impurities,\n\u03a3ee = \u03a300 + 2\u03a301 + \u03a311 .\n\n(19)\n\nHere the subscripts i, j = 0, 1 indicate whether the corresponding vertex is dressed by an impurity ladder. The factor\n2 in front of \u03a301 term reflects two possibilities of dressing one of the interaction vertices. Each of the terms \u03a3ij is a\nsum of two contributions, \u03a3ij = \u03a3aij + \u03a3bij , where \u03a3aij is the \"simple\" self-energy (Fig. 2a) and \u03a3bij is its Hikami-box\ncounterpart (Fig. 2b). We note that in Ref. 26 only one out of six diagrams (namely, \u03a3a01 ) was taken into account.\nThe expression for \u03a3a00 in a finite magnetic field reads\nX X Z d2 q\n2\na\n(20)\n\u03a300 (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) = \u2212T\n2 J|L| (qRc )V (i\u03c9k , q) G (i\u03b5n \u2212 i\u03c9k , m\u03c9c + L\u03c9c ) ,\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03c9k L\nwhere\nG(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) =\n\n1\ni\u03b5n + \u03bc \u2212 (m + 1/2)\u03c9c \u2212 \u03a3(i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c )\n\n(21)\n\n2\nis the Green's function in Landau levels representation, V (i\u03c9k , q) is the effective interaction, and J|L|\n(qRc ) describes\nthe bare vertex function connecting Landau levels m and m + L in the quasiclassical limit m, m + L \u226b 1 (for details\nsee, e.g., Ref. 37 and references therein). In the expressions for \u03a3a01 and \u03a3a11 this bare vertex function is multiplied\nby \u0393(i\u03c9k , q) and \u03932 (i\u03c9k , q), respectively, where \u0393 is the impurity ladder (Fig.3).\nIn the limit B \u2192 0, the corresponding self-energies depend on the momentum p instead of the Landau level index\nm. The interaction vertices are dressed only when the Matsubara energies at the vertices have opposite signs, which\nrestricts the summation over \u03c9k in \u03a301 and \u03a311 to the domain \u03b5n (\u03c9k \u2212 \u03b5n ) > 0:\nX Z d2 q\na\n\u03a300 (i\u03b5n , \u03bep ) = \u2212T\n(22)\n2 V (i\u03c9k , q) G(i\u03b5n \u2212 i\u03c9k , p \u2212 q),\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03c9k\nZ\nX\nd2 q\n\u03a3a01 (i\u03b5n , \u03bep ) = \u2212T\n(23)\n2 V (i\u03c9k , q) \u0393 (i\u03c9k , q) G(i\u03b5n \u2212 i\u03c9k , p \u2212 q),\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b5n (\u03c9k \u2212\u03b5n )>0\nZ\nX\nd2 q\n2\n\u03a3a11 (i\u03b5n , \u03bep ) = \u2212T\n(24)\n2 V (i\u03c9k , q) \u0393 (i\u03c9k , q) G(i\u03b5n \u2212 i\u03c9k , p \u2212 q),\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03b5n (\u03c9 \u2212\u03b5n )>0\nk\n\nwhere G (i\u03b5n , p) = [i\u03b5n + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bep + isgn\u03b5n /2\u03c4 \u2212 \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03bep )]\u22121 with \u03bep = p2 /2m and the vertex correction (Fig.3)\nreads\n1\n\u0393 (i\u03c9k , q) = q\n.\n2\n2\n(|\u03c9k | \u03c4 + 1) + (qvF \u03c4 ) \u2212 1\n\n(25)\n\nTo calculate the damping factor of the oscillations, we need the self-energy taken at the value of \u03be which is determined\nby the pole of the Green's function, \u03be = \u03be0 , see Appendix B. According to Eq. (18), the self-energy is further multiplied\nby Z in the damping exponent. This is equivalent to calculating the following integral:\nZ\nsgn \u03b5n 1 + \u03b20\na\nZ\u03a3ij (i\u01ebn , \u03be0 ) =\nd\u03bek G(i\u01ebn , k)\u03a3aij (i\u01ebn , \u03bek )\n2\u03c0i 1 + \u03b10\nZ\nv\u2217\ndkG(i\u01ebn , k)\u03a3aij (i\u01ebn , \u03bek ).\n(26)\n\u2243 sgn \u03b5n F\n2\u03c0i\nWe note that the Z-factor drops out in the product Z\u03a3. Indeed, the Green's function under the interaction line in\nthe self-energy contains the Z-factor in the numerator so that in the numerator of the product Z\u03a3 we get the factor\nZ 2 . However, the Z-factor is not a gauge invariant quantity and therefore should not appear in the expressions for\nobservables, in contrast to the FL-renormalized effective mass. At this point we should take into account the FL\nrenormalization of the two interaction vertices in \u03a3. Since we are interested in the contribution of relatively slow\ntransferred momenta and frequencies giving rise to the T dependence of B(T ), q \u226a kF and \u03c9k \u226a EF , we can set\nthem to zero when considering the FL vertex renormalization. Then one can apply the Ward identity for the FLinteraction dressing of the vertices39 , which amounts to multiplying each vertex by a factor 1/Z. These vertex factors\n\n\f7\nin the denominator of B(T ) cancel Z 2 in the numerator of B(T ). This implies that one can simply discard such\nrenormalizations, setting Z = 1 everywhere, when the observable quantities are calculated. The FL renormalization\nthen amounts to replacement of the bare band mass m, Fermi velocity vF , and elastic scattering time, \u03c4, by the\nrenormalized parameters, m\u2217 , vF\u2217 and \u03c4 \u2217 , respectively. In what follows, we will omit the asterisks, using the notation\nm, vF and \u03c4 for the renormalized quantities.\nThe relevant contributions to the self-energy are calculated in Appendix B. Combining all the terms together, we\nhave\nX Z d2 q\n\u03b4\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be0 ) = \u2212i T\n(27)\n2 V (i\u03c9m , q)K(i\u03c9m , q),\n(2\u03c0)\n\u03c9m >\u03b5n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n[1 + \u0393(i\u03c9m , q)]2\nW\n1\n1\u2212\n\u2212\nK(i\u03c9m , q) =\n,\n(28)\nS(i\u03c9m , q)\n\u03c4 S 2 (i\u03c9m , q)\nS0 (i\u03c9m , q)\nwhere\nS(i\u03c9m , q) =\nand\n\nq\nq\n(|\u03c9m | + 1/\u03c4 )2 + vF2 q 2 = W 2 + vF2 q 2 ,\nS0 (i\u03c9m , q) =\n\nW = |\u03c9m | + 1/\u03c4\n\nq\n|\u03c9m |2 + vF2 q 2 .\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nAn important feature of the kernel function K(i\u03c9m , q), Eq. (28), is that it is exactly zero for q = 0 for arbitrary\n\u03c9m . Indeed, using S(i\u03c9m , q = 0) = W , S0 (i\u03c9m , q = 0) = |\u03c9m |, and \u0393(i\u03c9m , q = 0) = 1/(W \u03c4 \u2212 1), we get\n\u0014\n\u00152 \u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1+\n1\u2212\n\u2212\nK(i\u03c9m , q = 0) =\nW\nW\u03c4 \u2212 1\nW\u03c4\n|\u03c9m |\n1\n1\n=\n\u2212\n= 0.\nW \u2212 1/\u03c4\n|\u03c9m |\n\n(31)\n\nWe stress that this equality only holds when all the contributions to the self-energy are combined together. This\nproperty of the kernel function is characteristic for the gauge-invariant quantities in the presence of interaction.\nIndeed, the interaction at q = 0 implies the shift of the chemical potential and hence can be gauged out2 . Therefore\nthe contribution of small q to the observables should be suppressed by vanishing of the corresponding kernel function.\nThe same situation is well known for the interaction-induced correction to the conductivity9 .\nIt is worth discussing a peculiarity of the problem of magnetooscillations with respect to the gauge invariance.\nThe gauge invariance of the oscillatory part of the observables is guaranteed by the fact that the thermodynamic\npotential is represented by closed loops. Since the characteristic spatial scale for such a loop is cyclotron radius Rc ,\nthe interaction with momenta q \u226a Rc\u22121 should not contribute. So, if we would find that our result does not satisfy\nthis requirement, it would mean that the diagrammatic treatment is not sufficient and should be complemented by\nthe infrared cutoff at q \u223c Rc\u22121 . On a more rigorous level this could be done by using the real-space path integral\napproach combining the treatment of magnetooscillations in the presence of long-range disorder40 with the quantum\nkinetic-equation approach to the interaction effects9,41 and to magnetotransport42. In this context, it is instructive\n\u22121\nto recall the calculation of the dephasing length l\u03c6 , where the infrared cutoff at q \u223c l\u03c6\nor q \u223c R\u22121 arises for the\nproblems of weak localization43 and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations44 in a ring of radius R, respectively.\nSince we find, however, that the kernel K(i\u03c9m , q) governing the perturbative self-energy (27) does satisfy K(i\u03c9m , q =\n0) = 0, the above cutoff is irrelevant and the perturbative treatment is sufficient in the considered regime of strongly\ndamped oscillations, T \u226b \u03c9c . Indeed, the q-integral in (27) is cut off at q \u223c \u03c9/vF \u223c T /vF which is much larger than\nRc\u22121 under the above condition.\nWe also emphasize that the kernel K(i\u03c9m , q) given by Eq. (28) vanishes in the clean limit\nK(i\u03c9m , q)|\u03c4 \u2192\u221e = 0.\n\n(32)\n\nThis implies, in particular, that the correction to the effective mass found in Refs. 32,33,45 from the \u03b5- and pdependence of the self-energy \u03a3(\u03b5, p) of a clean system, \u03b4m/m\u2217 \u223c T /EF does not show up in the damping of\nmagnetooscillations, in accordance with the statement made in Ref. 32. In general, \u03a3(\u03b5, p) is not an observable (and\nnot gauge invariant) quantity, and thus the above correction \u03b4m should be at least treated with caution.\n\n\f8\nIII.\n\nDAMPING OF MAGNETOOSCILLATIONS: SHORT-RANGE INTERACTION\n\nIn this section we evaluate \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be0 ) in the case of a weak point-like interaction given by\nV (i\u03c9m , q) \u2261 U0 .\n\n(33)\n\nWe are interested in the correction to the self-energy to the first order in \u03bdU0 , where \u03bd = m\u2217 /2\u03c0 is the density of\nstates per spin direction.

As we will see below, a term \u221d T ln(EF /T ) will arise from the\ncontributions of \u03a301 and \u03a311 , and hence \u03a300 yields only a subleading contribution to the damping.\nTo calculate the sum of logarithms in (39) we write\n\"\n#\np\np\n2\n2\nX\nX\nEF2 + \u03c9m\nEF2 + \u03c9m\nEF\nln\n.\n(40)\n=\n+ ln\nln\n\u03c9m\n\u03c9m\nEF\n\u03c9 >\u03b5\n\u03c9 >\u03b5\nm\n\nn\n\nm\n\nn\n\n\f9\nFor T \u226a EF the second sum can be replaced by the integral, yielding a T -independent contribution.

We see that the contribution to \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03c0T, \u03be0 ) containing vertex corrections to\nthe interaction line has an additional factor ln(EF /T ) as compared to the T -dependent part of \u03b4\u03a300 . In Eq. (41),\nwe have absorbed the contribution of \u03b4\u03a300 into the upper cutoff of the log-term which is given by EF up to a factor\nof order unity. Furthermore, the same can be done with the last term in Eq. (41 which at \u03b5n = \u03c0T also yields a\nlinear-in-T contribution. Equation (41) thus translates for T \u226b \u03c9c into the following expression for the damping\nexponent B(T ) = \u22122\u03c0i\u03b4\u03a3(i\u03c0T, \u03be0 )/\u03c9c :\nB(T ) = \u2212c1 \u03bdU0\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0T \u03bdU0\nc2 EF\n+\nln\n.\n\u03c9c \u03c4\n\u03c9c EF \u03c4\nT\n\n(42)\n\nThe first term in Eq.

(15) in Sec. II. The second term represents\nthe T -dependent contribution to the damping factor that we are interested in and is analyzed in the next section.\nIV.\n\nINTERPRETATION: EFFECTIVE MASS VS QUANTUM SCATTERING TIME\n\nThe above result (42) can be interpreted in terms of corrections to the effective mass (or \u03c9c ) and the elastic scattering\nrate entering the standard formula (17). These corrections come from the interplay of disorder and interaction.

(42) is absorbed in \u03c4 ], we see that the T ln T dependence\nof the damping factor could in principle originate either from the ln T correction to the effective mass, or from the\nT ln T -type correction to \u03c4 . This led the authors of Ref. 26 to the conclusion that the nonlinear T \u2212dependence of the\ndamping factor may be equivalently interpreted either as a T \u2212dependent renormalization of the effective mass or as\na T \u2212dependent Dingle temperature. It is clear, however, that these two possibilities correspond to different physical\nprocesses.\n\n\f10\nA.\n\nSelf-energy at real energies: analytical continuation\n\nTo identify the physical origin of the leading contribution to the damping it is instructive to obtain B(T ) using the\nexpression for the self-energy analytically continued to real values of energies \u03b5n \u2192 \u2212i\u03b5 .

(41)] with \u2212\u2202nF (\u03b5)/\u2202\u03b5.\nIt is clear from these results that the leading term in B(T ) [proportional to T ln(EF /T ), Eq. (42)] originates from the\nreal part of the self-energy, Eq. (46), i.e. from renormalization of the effective mass, which affects incommensurability\nof the oscillations at different values of energy \u03b5. The contribution to B(T ) of the imaginary part of the self-energy\n[corresponding to the last term in Eq. (41)], which is governed in the ballistic regime by the renormalization of the\nscattering time, is smaller by a factor ln(EF /T ). In the expression for the damping, Eq. (42), this contribution is\nabsorbed in the numerical constant c2 in the upper cutoff of the logarithm.\nThe obtained result for the interaction-induced correction to the scattering time \u03c4 , Eq. (57), agrees, up to a\nfactor 21 , with the correction to the transport time following from the calculation of conductivity correction in the\nballistic regime in Ref. 9. This is exactly what one would expect on physical grounds. Indeed, it is known that the\nconductivity correction9 can be understood as governed by an additional, predominantly back-scattering, contribution\nto the scattering cross-section related to the dressing of an impurity by Friedel oscillations. Since this contribution is\nconcentrated near the scattering angle \u03c6 = \u03c0, the correction to the momentum relaxation rate is larger by the factor\n1 \u2212 cos \u03c6 \u2243 2 than the correction to the total scattering rate. In Sec. IV B we will corroborate the results of this\nsubsection by an explicit calculation of the contribution to the impurity scattering rate due to Friedel oscillations.\nUp to now we calculated the exchange contribution to the self-energy. For the point-like interaction, the Hartree\nterm has opposite sign and is twice larger in magnitude than the exchange term due to the spin summation. This\nsimply reverses the sign of the corrections to the damping factor.\nB.\n\nCalculation of \u03b4\u03c4 from the scattering off Friedel oscillations.\n\nIn this subsection we calculate the correction to the total elastic scattering time \u03b4\u03c4 in a different, physically more\ntransparent way, considering the scattering off impurities dressed by Friedel oscillations9,38 . We will demonstrate how\nthe result (57) is reproduced in this way. In particular, this will confirm once more that there is no T ln T term in \u03b4\u03c4\nand therefore the leading T ln T contribution to the damping factor comes from \u03b4m.\nWe start with the expression relating the total elastic scattering rate and the scattering cross-section S(\u03c6) of a\nsingle impurity,\nZ\nd\u03c6\n1\n= nimp vF\nS(\u03c6),\n(58)\n\u03c4q (\u03b5, T )\n2\u03c0\nwhere nimp is the concentration of impurities.

The correction to the impurity cross-section at the angle \u03c6 arises due to the interference of\ntwo electronic waves9,38 , one of which (dashed line) scattered by the impurity and another (solid line) by the Friedel oscillations\nat a point parametrized by the distance r from the impurity and the angle \u03c8.\n\nR\nHere S0 = 2\u03c0\u03bdV02 /vF is the bare impurity scattering cross-section and V0 = d2 rV0 (r), where V0 (r) is the bare\npoint-like impurity potential. The cross-section S(\u03c6) depends on energy \u01eb of an electron through k = kF + \u01eb/vF in\nthe Fourier transform V (q) = V0 + \u03b4V (q) of the effective impurity potential, renormalized by the Friedel oscillations\nof the electron density. For r \u226b kF\u22121 the oscillatory correction to the electron density reads\n\u03b4\u03c1(r) = \u2212\u03bdV0\n\n(2\u03c0rT /vF ) sin 2kF r\n.\nsinh(2\u03c0rT /vF )\n\u03c0r2\n\n(61)\n\nThe correction to the impurity scattering potential \u03b4V (r) due to scattering off the Friedel oscillations is proportional,\nfor the short-range interaction, to the electron density at point r. Similarly to the consideration of Sec. III and\nSec. IV A, we will concentrate on the exchange part of this correction,\n1\n\u03b4V (r) = \u2212 U0 \u03b4\u03c1(r).\n2\nTo calculate the correction to the impurity cross-section, we need the Fourier transform of \u03b4V (r),\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ\nU0\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n=\nd2 r \u03b4\u03c1(r) exp 2i kr sin cos \u03c8 ,\n\u03b4V 2k sin\n2\n2\n2\n\n(62)\n\n(63)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the polar angle of r, see Fig. 4.

The explicit expression for S(\u03c6) at T = 0 can be found in Ref. 9. In\nFig. 5 we plotted S(\u03c6) for fixed T and several values of \u03b5 (Fig. 5a) and for fixed \u03b5 = 0 and several values of T (Fig. 5b).\nTo calculate the (\u03b5, T )-dependent correction to 1/\u03c4q (which is determined by the \"hump\"), we expand sin(\u03c6/2)\naround \u03c6 = \u03c0. Furthermore, we expand cos \u03c8 around \u03c8 = \u03c0 and \u03c8 = 0 in the expressions for \u03b2+ and \u03b2\u2212 , respectively.\nThis corresponds to the two possible interfering paths propagating along the horizontal line in Fig. 4 with the scattering\noff the Friedel oscillation occurring either to the left or to the right from the impurity.

(55) and (57). More accurately,\nEq. (70) differs from Eq. (55) by the last (T -independent) term \u03bdU0 \u03b5/2EF \u03c4 , which drops out after the thermal\naveraging with \u2212\u2202nF (\u03b5)/\u2202\u03b5 and thus does not contribute to \u03b4\u03c4q (T ), Eq. (57). This term is in a sense anomalous,\nsince it arises from the ultraviolet limit of the \u03c9-integration in Eq. (68). In fact, one could question the validity of\nthis contribution, since we used the asymptotic, large-r form of the Friedel oscillations in Eq. (61). One can check,\nhowever, that the same result [up to an irrelevant additive constant independent of T and \u03b5: in Eq. (67) \u03c0\u03bdU0 is\nreplaced by 2\u03bdU0 ] is obtained from a calculation using the exact form of the Friedel oscillations46 . The appearance of\nthis linear-in-\u03b5 term is related to the violation of the particle-hole symmetry in the parabolic spectrum; this term did\nnot appear in the diagrammatic calculation of Sec. IV where the spectrum was linearized. What however enters the\nexperimental damping of magnetooscillations is 1/\u03c4q integrated over the energy with an even function \u2212\u2202nF (\u03b5)/\u2202\u03b5.\nTherefore, we are in fact interested in the collision rate symmetrized with respect to \u03b5 \u2192 \u2212\u03b5. Performing this\nsymmetrization in Eq. (64), we get a result determined solely by the infrared scale, r \u223c vF /T , yielding Eq. (70)\nwithout the last, linear-in-\u03b5 term.\nFinally, using (59), we see that the correction to the transport rate is larger than \u03b4(1/\u03c4q ) by a factor of 2. The\ncorresponding correction to the conductivity reproduces the result of Ref. 9 in the ballistic limit.\n\n\f14\n\n=\n\n+\n\n\u03a0\n\nFIG. 6: Diagrammatic equation for the effective interaction line (bold wavy line) in the random-phase approximation, Eqs.

Dotted wavy line represents the bare interaction, V0 (q)+F0\u03c1 /2\u03bd in the singlet channel or F0\u03c3 /2\u03bd in the triplet channel.\nThe bubble \u03a0 is the polarization operator, Eq. (72).\n\nV.\n\nDAMPING OF MAGNETOOSCILLATIONS: COULOMB INTERACTION\n\nWe turn now to the Coulomb interaction. In the case of Coulomb interaction, one should take into account the\ndynamical screening of the interaction within the random phase approximation (RPA), see Fig. 6. In what follows\nwe use for simplicity the so-called F0 -approximation9, which retains only the zeroth harmonics of the Fermi-liquid\nconstants F0\u03c1 and F0\u03c3 in the charge and spin channels, respectively. Then the effective interaction propagator in the\ncharge channel (combining the exchange term and the singlet contribution of the Hartree-type interaction) reads9,10\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\nV \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q) = (V0 (q) + F0\u03c1 /2\u03bd)\u22121 + \u03a0 (i\u03c9m , q)\n,\n(71)\nwhere \u03a0 (i\u03c9m , q) is the polarization operator\n\n\u03a0 (i\u03c9m , q) = 2\u03bd [1 \u2212 |\u03c9m | \u03c4 \u0393 (i\u03c9m , q)] ,\n\n(72)\n\n\u0393 (i\u03c9m , q) is the impurity ladder, and \u03bd = m/2\u03c0 is the density of states per spin direction. The triplet contribution\nto the effective interaction arises from the ladder of Hartree-type interaction blocks and reads\nV \u03c3 (i\u03c9m , q) = [2\u03bd/F0\u03c3 + \u03a0 (i\u03c9m , q)]\u22121 .\n\nA.\n\n(73)\n\nSinglet channel\n\nThe main difference as compared to the case of the short-range weak interaction considered in Sec. III is the\nnontrivial form of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction (one should take into account the renormalization\nof the interaction by polarization operator). Using\nV0 (q) =\n\n2\u03c0e2\nq\n\nand neglecting F\u03c10 , we get\nV \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q) =\n\n=\n\n2\u03c0e2 /q\nV0 (q)\n=\n2\n1 + V0 (q)\u03a0(i\u03c9m , q)\n1 + (2\u03c0e /q)2\u03bd[1 \u2212 |\u03c9m |\u03c4 \u0393(i\u03c9m , q)]\n1\n\u03ba(S \u2212 1/\u03c4 )\n.\n2\u03bd (q + \u03ba)(S \u2212 1/\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03ba(W \u2212 1/\u03c4 )\n\n(74)\n\nHere we use the standard notation\n\u03ba = 4\u03c0\u03bde2 for the inverse Thomas\u2013Fermi screening radius and use the short-hand\np\n2\nnotation S for S(i\u03c9m , q) \u2261 W + vF2 q 2 with W = |\u03c9m | + 1/\u03c4 .\nFor q \u226a \u03ba, neglecting q in the sum q + \u03ba in the denominator of (74), one finds that the exchange interaction\n\u1e7c \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q) =\n\n1 S \u2212 1/\u03c4\n2\u03bd S \u2212 W\n\n(75)\n\nhas a singularity \u221d 1/q 2 in the limit q \u2192 0:\n\u1e7c \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q) =\n\n1 2|\u03c9m |(|\u03c9m | + 1/\u03c4 )\n,\n2\u03bd\nq 2 vF2\n\nq \u2192 0,\n\n(76)\n\nso that each separate term \u03a3aij , \u03a3bij in the self-energy would diverge. This divergence is analogous to the one\nencountered in course of calculation of the tunneling density of states1 . In that case, one has to keep the q term\n\n\f15\nin denominator of (74), which cuts off the logarithmic divergence. For the present problem, this is, however, not\nneeded. Indeed, as was emphasized in the end of Sec. II, the kernel K(i\u03c9m , q) combining together contributions\nof all relevant self-energy diagrams is proportional to q 2 in the limit q \u2192 0 and hence cancels the singularity in\n\u1e7c (i\u03c9m , q). In view of this, it is convenient to represent the kernel function (28) in a form which shows explicitly that\nK(i\u03c9m , q = 0) = 0 [we recall that S0 (q = 0) = |\u03c9m | and S(q = 0) = W ]:\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n1\nS\u2212W\n1\n1\n1\n+\n.\n(77)\nK(i\u03c9m , q) = \u2212\n+\n\u2212\nS0\n|\u03c9m |\nS \u2212 1/\u03c4 S\u03c4 (S \u2212 1/\u03c4 ) |\u03c9m |\nThen the product \u1e7c \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q)K(i\u03c9m , q) takes the form\n2\u03bd \u1e7c \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q)K(i\u03c9m , q) =\n\n1\n1\nS0 \u2212 |\u03c9m |\n+\n\u2212\n.\nS0 (S \u2212 W ) S0\nS\u03c4 (S \u2212 1/\u03c4 )\n\n(78)\n\nPerforming the integration over the momentum q in (27), we get the correction to self-energy in the singlet (charge)\nchannel\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2206\n2\nX\n1 + 2\u03c9m \u03c4\niT\n\u22062 + \u03c9m\n\u03c1\n,\n(79)\n(1 + 2\u03c9m \u03c4 ) ln\n\u03b4\u03a3 (i\u03b5n , \u03be0 ) = \u2212\n\u2212 1 + ln\n2\n2EF \u03c4 \u03c9 >\u03b5\n2\u03c9m \u03c4\n\u03c9m\nm\n\nn\n\nwhere we introduced\n\n\u2206 \u2261 \u03bavF .\n\n(80)\n\nComparing (79) and (39), we see that the last term in (79) corresponds to a static short-range interaction with\n\u03bdU0 = 1.\nSetting \u03b5n = \u03c0T and separating the contributions to the sum (79) governed by the high-energy (\u03b5 \u223c \u2206) and\nlow-energy (\u03b5 \u223c T ) regions, we can present the result in the following form:\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0015\niT\n\u2206\nconst\u2206\n1\n\u03b4\u03a3\u03c1 (i\u03c0T, \u03be0 ) = \u2212\nln \u2212 f (4\u03c0T \u03c4 ) ,\n\u2212 1\u2212\n(81)\n2EF \u03c4\nT\n8\u03c0T \u03c4\nT\nwhere f (x) is a parameterless function,\n\uf8f1\n\u0015\n\u0014\ncf\n1\n1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nln ,\n+\n+\nx \u226a 1,\n\uf8f4\n\u0015 \uf8f2\n\u221e \u0014\nX\nx\n2x 2\nx\n1\n1 + mx\n=\n+\n(82)\n1 \u2212 (1 + mx) ln\nf (x) =\n\uf8f4 \u03c02\nmx\n2mx\n\uf8f4\nm=1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n,\nx \u226b 1,\n36 x2\nwith cf = \u22123/4 \u2212 \u03c8(1)/2 = \u22120.461392..

IV, this result arises due to the correction to the effective mass (the consideration of Sec. IV fully\napplies to the case of the Coulomb interaction as well).\nIt is worth noting that due to the factor (1 + F0\u03c3 ) in the denominator of B \u03c3 (T ), the damping of magnetooscillations\ntends to diverge upon approaching the Stoner ferromagnetic instability. Since the damping is determined by the\neffective mass m\u2217 (T ) (see Sec. IV), we conclude that m\u2217 (T ) diverges as F0\u03c3 \u2192 \u22121 due to the interplay of disorder\nand interaction. This should be contrasted with the clean case, where the effective mass is solely determined by\nFermi-liquid constant in the singlet channel, F1\u03c1 , and hence is insensitive to the ferromagnetic instability.\nC.\n\nDiscussion and comparison to earlier work\n\nLet us discuss the obtained results for the damping factor B(T ). In both the diffusive and ballistic regimes we find\nthe temperature dependence of the form B(T ) \u221d T ln T . In the diffusive (low-T ) regime the relative correction to the\ndamping factor, \u03c9c \u03c4 B \u223c g \u22121 T \u03c4 ln T is less singular than the known corrections1 to the conductivity, \u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3 \u223c g \u22121 ln T ,\nand the tunneling density of states, \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u223c g \u22121 ln2 T (here g \u223c EF \u03c4 is the dimensionless conductivity). On the\ntechnical level, the qualitative difference with the tunneling DOS can be traced back to the contribution of the\nHikami box diagrams, \u03a3bij .\nAs has been already mentioned in Sec. I, the problem of the effect of the interaction on magnetooscilations was\nrecently addressed in Ref. 26. The result of this work for the damping factor is qualitatively similar to ours, B \u221d T ln T .\nHowever, the crossover function and, in particular, the prefactors in both ballistic and diffusive limits differ from ours\n(1 instead of 3/2 in the first line of Eq. (85), and 3/2 instead of 1 in the second line). This difference is not surprising,\nsince the authors of Ref. 26 took into account only one diagram \u03a3a01 out of six in Fig. 2. Thus, even the qualitative\nagreement may be considered as an accidental coincidence. In fact, there is a conceptual difference between our result\nand that of Ref. 26. To illustrate this, consider a toy interaction of the type V (\u03c9, q) = F (\u03c9)\u03b4(q). Our result then\nwould be zero, since the kernel function K(i\u03c9m , q), Eq. (28), satisfies the gauge-invariance constraint [see Eq. (31)\n\n\f17\nand discussion below it],\nK(i\u03c9m , q)|q=0 = 0.\n\n(87)\n\nIn contrast, the formula of Ref. 26 would give a finite result, since their kernel\n1\n2\n(a)\nK01 =\nS S\u03c4 \u2212 1\ndoes not satisfy the requirement (87),\n2\n(a)\nK01 (i\u03c9m , q = 0) =\n.\n|\u03c9m |(|\u03c9m |\u03c4 + 1)\n\n(88)\n\nFor the Coulomb interaction this results in a logarithmic divergency at small q that is cut off by the plasmon pole at\nq \u223c qmin with\nqmin =\n\n|\u03c9m |(|\u03c9m | + 1/\u03c4 )\n,\n\u03bavF2\n\nsimilarly to the calculation of the tunneling density of states1 . As we explained in the end of Sec. II, the contribution\nof small momenta, q < Rc\u22121 , should be suppressed for the present problem. Therefore, the above small-q divergence\nshould be cut off by the magnetic field, which would partly transform ln T of Ref. 26 into ln B. However, this problem\nis in fact spurious: the result of our work does not suffer from any infrared divergencies, since our kernel K(i\u03c9m , q)\ndoes satisfy Eq. (87).\nFinally, let us briefly comment on the ultra-diffusive regime, T \u226a \u03c9c \u226a 1/\u03c4. In this regime the summation over\nMatsubara energies \u03b5n is not restricted to n = 0 and Nc \u223c \u03c9c /T \u226b 1 Matsubara harmonics are important. Therefore,\nthe damping due to the inelastic scattering [suppressed only for n = 0, see Ref. 26 and Eq. (B.13)] becomes finite.\nThe corresponding contribution to the damping can be roughly estimated using Eq. (B.13) taken at relevant n \u223c Nc :\n\u03b4B inel (T ) \u223c \u2212 n2\n\nT2\nln(EF \u03c4 )\n\u03c9c EF\n\nn\u223cNc\n\n\u223c\u2212\n\n\u03c9c\nln(EF \u03c4 ),\nEF\n\n(89)\n\nyielding |\u03b4B inel (T )| \u226a 1, since in the ultra-diffusive regime \u03c9c \u226a 1/\u03c4 . Thus the inelastic contribution to the damping\nfactor is always small. Note that the contribution to the damping due to the renormalization of the effective mass in\nthe ultra-diffusive regime is also small: at n = Nc we have B(T ) = \u22122\u03c0\u03b5n /\u03c9c \u03b4m/m \u223c \u03b4m/m \u226a 1.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the T -dependent interaction corrections to the damping of magnetooscillations in\na two-dimensional electron gas. The damping factor has been calculated for Coulomb and short-range interaction in\nthe whole range of temperatures, from the ballistic to the diffusive regime. While the relevant diagrams are similar\nto those for the local density of states, the results are essentially different, see Eqs. (42), (83).\nWe have identified leading contributions to the damping induced by interplay of interaction and disorder, which can\nbe associated with corrections to the effective mass and the quantum scattering time. It has been shown that in the\nballistic regime, which is typically realized in low-disorder samples at realistic temperatures, the dominant effect is that\nof the renormalization of the effective electron mass due to the interplay of the interaction and impurity scattering.\nSpecifically, the correction to the effective mass is of the form \u03b4m/m \u223c 1/(EF \u03c4 ) ln(EF /T ), Eq.(56). The correction\nto the impurity scattering time is of the form \u03b4\u03c4q /\u03c4 \u223c T /EF , Eq. (57), and yields a subleading contribution to the\ndamping. We have confirmed the result for the correction to the quantum scattering time by performing a calculation\nbased on the picture of scattering by impurities dressed by Friedel oscillations. The results of the paper are relevant\nto the analysis of experiments on magnetooscillations (in particular, for extracting the value of the effective mass) and\nare expected to be useful for understanding the physics of a high-mobility 2DEG near the apparent metal-insulator\ntransition.\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank I.

Thus, to extract the oscillatory\ncontribution to \u03a9, we should calculate the following integral\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\ne\u00b12\u03c0ik\u03be/\u03c9c\n\u2202\u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03be)\nd\u03be\nI\u00b1 =\n1+\n.\n(A.2)\n\u03be \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 i\u03b5n + \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03be) \u2212 i sgn \u03b5n /2\u03c4\n\u2202\u03be\n0\nHere we introduce the self-energy \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03be), which is a function defined in the plane of a complex variable \u03be, such\nthat\n\u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , m\u03c9c ) = \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03be = m\u03c9c ).\n\n(A.3)\n\nThe main contribution comes from the pole \u03be = \u03be0 , where \u03be0 obeys the self-consistent equation\n\u03be0 = \u03bc + i\u03b5n +\n\ni\nsgn \u03b5n \u2212 \u03a3ee (i\u03b5n , \u03be0 ).\n2\u03c4\n\n(A.4)\n\nWe expand the self-energy (from now on we will skip the subscript \"ee\" in \u03a3ee ) in the vicinity of the pole,\n\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be) \u2243 \u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be0 ) + (\u03be \u2212 \u03be0 )\n\n\u2202\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be)\n\u2202\u03be\n\n.\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u03be=\u03be0\n\nThen the denominator in Eq. (A.2) becomes proportional to (1 + \u2202\u03a3/\u2202\u03be) so that these factors drop out and the\nintegral takes a simple form\nZ \u221e\nexp[\u00b12\u03c0ik \u03be/\u03c9c ]\nd\u03be\nI\u00b1 =\n.\n(A.6)\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be0\n0\nWe first single out the FL renormalization factors in \u03a3, i.e. represent the self-energy in the following form (assuming\na constant electron concentration)\n\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be) \u2243 \u03b4\u03bc + \u03b20 (\u03be \u2212 \u03bc\u0303) \u2212 i\u03b10 \u03b5n + \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be),\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc\u0303 = \u03bc \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc = \u03c0ne /m\nis the chemical potential for noninteracting electrons (ne is the electron concentration): \u03be \u2212 \u03bc\u0303 \u2243 vF (k \u2212 kF ). The\ncorrection to the self-energy \u03b4\u03a3(i\u03b5n , \u03be) contains contributions that are smaller that \u03b20 (\u03be \u2212 \u03bc) and \u03b10 \u03b5n by either T /EF\nor 1/EF \u03c4 . These additional contributions are related to the inelastic processes and to the modification of the pure\nFL result due to disorder.\nIn order to solve Eq. (A.4), we treat the subleading terms constituting \u03b4\u03a3 as small corrections. Solving Eq. (A.4)\nby iterations, we first find its solution neglecting these small corrections and expanding \u03a300 around the mass-shell:\n(0)\n\n\u03be0 \u2243 \u03bc\u0303 + i\u03b5n +\n\ni\n(0)\nsgn \u03b5n + i\u03b10 \u03b5n \u2212 \u03b20 (\u03be0 \u2212 \u03bc\u0303),\n2\u03c4\n\n(A.8)\n\nwhich yields\n(0)\n\n\u03be0 =\n\n1 + \u03b10\ni sgn \u03b5n\n\u03c0ne\n+\n+ i\u03b5n\n.\nm\n1 + \u03b20\n2\u03c4 (1 + \u03b20 )\n\n(A.9)\n\nNext we use this value of \u03be0 in \u03b4\u03a3 and solve the self-consistent equation again, now keeping the terms previously\nneglected.

As\nthe first approximation, we have set in Eq.

The first term in (B.13) determines the FL Z-factor and\nhas been separated from \u03b4\u03a3 which governs the correction to the damping factor, see Eq. (A.7). As for the second\nterm, its imaginary part describes the inelastic electron-electron scattering, while its real part contributes to the\nrenormalization of the effective mass32,33,45 . However, when taken at \u01eb0 = \u03c0T, as appropriate for the damping of the\nmagnetooscillations at T \u226b \u03c9c , the second term in (B.13) vanishes, in agreement with Ref. 26.

Aristov, Phys. Rev. B 55, 8064 (1997).\nTechnically, this difference between the Coulomb interaction case and the short-range interaction case can be traced back to\nthe contribution of \u03a300 represented by the first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (78). For Coulomb interaction this term produces in\nthe diffusive regime a T ln T contribution to the damping factor. In the ballistic regime, where the frequency dependence of\nscreening becomes irrelevant (cf. the conductivity corrections, Refs. 9,10) and the Coulomb interaction reduces to a constant,\nV \u03c1 (i\u03c9m , q) \u2243 1/2\u03bd, this term yields a subleading contribution as in the case of the short-range interaction.\nE.A.
