The \"reconstruction problem\" is the problem of determining the state of the root, given the distribution of the Markov chain\non level n of the tree, as n gets larger and larger (a precise definition is given below). For the symmetric\nbinary channel (\u03b4 = 0), it was known since 1995 that the reconstruction problem is solvable if and only if\nb\u03b8 2 > 1. For all other channels, it was also known and easy to prove that b\u03b8 2 > 1 implies solvability, but\nexact non-solvability results were not known. Here we show that this bound is tight provided that M is close\nenough to symmetric-i.e., we show that the reconstruction problem for M on T is not solvable if b\u03b8 2 \u2264 1\nand |\u03b4| is sufficiently small.\nThe reconstruction problem is intimately related to mixing of Glauber dynamics and to phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, it was recently claimed that the reconstruction problem corresponds to the \"replica\nsymmetry broken\" solution of the spin glass on the tree. replica symmetry breaking is a central notion\nin the statistical physics theory of spin glasses and random satisfiability problems. We discuss potential\napplications of our results in these different areas.\n\n1.1 Definitions and Main Result\nLet T = (V, E, \u03c1) be a tree T with nodes V , edges E and root \u03c1 \u2208 V . We direct all edges away from the\nroot, so that if e = (x, y) then x is on the path connecting \u03c1 to y. Let d(*, *) denote the graph-metric distance\non T , and Ln = {v \u2208 V : d(\u03c1, v) = n} be the nth level of the tree. For x \u2208 V and e = (y, z) \u2208 E, we\ndenote |x| = d(\u03c1, x), d(x, (y, z)) = max{d(x, y), d(x, z)}, and |e| = d(\u03c1, e). The b-ary tree is the infinite\nrooted tree where each vertex has exactly b children.\nA Markov chain on the tree T is a probability measure defined on the state space C V , where C is a finite\ne )\nset. Assume first that T is finite and, for each edge e of T , let M e = (Mi,j\ni,j\u2208C be a stochastic matrix. In\ne\nthis case the probability measure defined by (M : e \u2208 E) on T is given by\nY\n(x,y)\n(2)\nM\u03c3(x),\u03c3(y) .\n\u03bcl (\u03c3) = 1{\u03c3(\u03c1)=l}\n(x,y)\u2208E\n\nIn other words, the root state \u03c3(\u03c1) satisfies \u03c3(\u03c1) = l and then each vertex iteratively chooses its state from\nthe one of its parent by an application of the Markov transition rule given by M e (and all such applications\nare independent). We can define the measure \u03bcl on an infinite tree as well, by Kolmogorov's extension\ntheorem, but we will not need chains on infinite trees in this paper (see [8] for basic properties of Markov\nchains on trees).\nInstead, for an infinite tree T , we let Tn = (Vn , En , \u03c1), where Vn = {x \u2208 V : d(x, \u03c1) \u2264 n}, En = {e \u2208\nE : d(e, \u03c1) \u2264 n} and define \u03bcnl by (2) for Tn . We are particularly interested in the distribution of the states\n\u03c3(x) for x \u2208 Ln , the set of leaves in Tn . This distribution, denoted by \u03bcnk , is the projection of \u03bcnk on C Ln\ngiven by\nX\n{\u03bcnk (\u03c3) : \u03c3|Ln = \u03c3}.\n\u03bcnk (\u03c3) =\n(3)\n\u03c3\u0304\n\nRecall that for distributions \u03bc and \u03bd on the same space \u03a9 the total variation distance between \u03bc and \u03bd is\n1X\n|\u03bc(\u03c3) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c3)|.\n(4)\nDV (\u03bc, \u03bd) =\n2\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a9\n\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1 (Reconstructibility) The reconstruction problem for the infinite tree T and (M e : e \u2208 E) is\nsolvable if there exist i, j \u2208 C for which\nlim inf DV (\u03bcni , \u03bcnj ) > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(5)\n\nWhen M e = M for all e, we say that the reconstruction problem is solvable for T and M .\nWe will be mostly interested in binary channels, i.e., transition matrices on the state space {\u00b1}. In this case,\nthe definition above says that the reconstruction problem is solvable if\nlim inf DV (\u03bcn+ , \u03bcn\u2212 ) > 0.\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(6)\n\nOur main result is the following:\nTheorem 1 (Main Result) For all b \u2265 2, there exists a \u03b40 > 0 such that for all |\u03b4| \u2264 \u03b40 , the reconstruction\nproblem for M on the b-ary tree Tb is not solvable if b\u03b8 2 \u2264 1.\n\n1.2 Previous Results\nThe study of the reconstruction problem began in the seventies [23, 9] when the problem was introduced\nin terms of the extremality of the free Gibbs measure on the tree. In [9] it is shown that the reconstruction\nproblem for the binary symmetric channel (equation (1) where \u03b4 = 0) on the binary tree is solvable when\n2\u03b8 2 > 1. This in fact follows from a previous work [12] which implies that for any Markov chain M , the\nreconstruction problem on the b-ary tree is solvable if b\u03b8 2 > 1 where \u03b8 is the second largest eigenvalue of\nM in absolute value.\nProving non-reconstructibility turned out to be harder. While coupling arguments easily yield nonreconstruction, these arguments are typically not tight. A natural way to try to prove non-reconstructibility\nis to analyze recursions 1) in terms of random variables each of whose values is the expectation of the chain\nat a vertex, given the state at the leaves of the subtree below it, 2) in terms of ratios of such probabilities,\nor 3) in terms of log-likelihood ratios of such probabilities. Such recursions were analyzed for a closely\nrelated model in [3]. Both the reconstruction model and the model analyzed in [3] deal with the correlation\nbetween the nth -level and the root. However, while in the reconstruction problem, the two random variables\nare generated according to the Markov model on the tree, in [3] the nodes at level n are set to have an i.i.d.\ndistribution and the root has the conditional distribution thus induced.\nIn spite of this important difference, the two models are closely related. In particular, in [3] it is shown\nthat for the binary tree, the correlation between level n and the root decays if and only if 2\u03b8 2 \u2264 1. Building\non the techniques of [3] it was finally shown in [2] that the reconstruction problem for the binary symmetric\nchannel is solvable if and only if 2\u03b8 2 > 1. This result was later reproven in various ways [5, 10, 1, 15].\nThe elegance of the threshold b\u03b8 2 = 1 raised the hope that it is the threshold for reconstruction for\ngeneral channels. However, previous attempts to generalize any of the proofs to other channels have failed.\nMoreover in [18] it was shown that for asymmetric binary channels and for symmetric channels on large\nalphabets the reconstruction problem is solvable in cases where b\u03b8 2 < 1. In fact [18] contains an example of\na channel satisfying \u03b8 = 0 for which the reconstruction problem is solvable. On the other hand, in [20, 11] it\nis shown that the threshold b\u03b8 2 = 1 is the threshold for two variants of the reconstruction problem, \"census\nreconstruction\" and \"robust reconstruction\".\nThe results above led some to believe that \"reconstruction\" unlike its siblings \"census reconstruction\"\nand \"robust reconstruction\" is an extremely sensitive property and that the threshold b\u03b8 2 = 1 is tight only\nfor the binary symmetric channel. This conceptual picture was shaken by recent results in the theoretical\n3\n\n\fphysics literature [17] where using variational principles developed in the context of \"replica symmetry\nbreaking\" it is suggested that the bound b\u03b8 2 = 1 is tight for symmetric channels on 3 and (maybe) 4 letters.\nIn Theorem 1 we give the first tight threshold for the reconstruction problem for channels other than\nbinary symmetric channels. We show that for asymmetric channels that are close to symmetric, the KestenStigum bound b\u03b8 2 = 1 is tight for reconstruction. Our proof builds on ideas from [3, 2, 5, 22] and is\nextremely simple. In addition to giving a new result for the asymmetric channel, our proof also provides a\nmuch simpler proof of the previously known result for the binary symmetric channel.\n\n1.3 The Reconstruction Problem in Mixing, Phylogeny and Replicas\nMixing of Markov Chains. One of the main themes at the intersection of statistical physics and theoretical\ncomputer science in recent years has been the study of connections between spatial and temporal mixing. It\nis widely accepted that spatial mixing and temporal mixing of dynamics go hand in hand though this was\nproven only in restricted settings.\nIn particular, the spatial mixing condition is usually stated in terms of uniqueness of Gibbs measures.\nHowever, as shown in [1] , this spatial condition is too strong. In particular, it is shown in [1] that the\nspectral gap of continuous-time Glauber dynamics for the Ising model with no external field and no boundary\nconditions on the b-ary tree is \u03a9(1) whenever b\u03b8 2 < 1. This should be compared with the uniqueness\ncondition on the tree given by b\u03b8 < 1. In [15] this result is extended to the log Sobolev constant. In [15]\nit is also shown that for measures on trees, a super-linear decay of point-to-set correlations implies an \u03a9(1)\nspectral gap for the Glauber dynamics with free boundary conditions.\nThus our results not only give the exact threshold for reconstructibility. They also yield an exact threshold for mixing of Glauber dynamics on the tree for Ising models with a small external field. The details are\nomitted from this extended abstract.\nPhylogenetic Reconstruction. Phylogenetic reconstruction is a major task of systematic biology [6]. It\nwas recently shown in [4] that for binary symmetric channels, also called CFN models in evolutionary biology, the sampling efficiency of phylogenetic reconstruction is determined by the reconstruction threshold.\nThus if for all edges of the tree it holds that 2\u03b8 2 > 1 the tree can be recovered efficiently from O(log n)\nsamples. If 2\u03b8 2 < 1, then [19] implies that n\u03a9(1) samples are needed. In fact, the proof of the lower bound\nin [19] implies the lower bound n\u03a9(1) whenever the reconstruction problem is exponentially unsolvable. In\nother words, if lim inf r\u2192\u221e DV (\u03bcr+ , \u03bcr\u2212 ) = exp(\u2212\u03a9(r)) then a lower bound of n\u03a9(1) holds for phylogenetic\nreconstruction.\nThus, our results here imply n\u03a9(1) lower bounds for phylogenetic reconstruction for asymmetric channels such that 2\u03b8 2 < 1 and |\u03b4| < \u03b40 . The details are omitted from this extended abstract. It is natural\nto conjecture that this is tight and that if 2\u03b8 2 > 1 then phylogenetic reconstruction may be achieved with\nO(log n) sequences.\nReplica Symmetry Breaking. The replica and cavity methods were invented in the theoretical physics\nliterature to solve Ising spin glass problems on the complete graph-the so-called Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nmodel. These methods, while not mathematically rigorous, led to numerous predictions on the spin glass\nand other models on dense graphs, a few of which were proved many years later. When applied to random\nsatisfiability problems, which turn out to be equivalent to dilute spin glasses-i.e., spin glasses on sparse\nrandom graphs-these methods led to the empirically best algorithms for solving random satisfiability problems [16, 21].\nA central concept in this theory is the notion of a \"glassy phase\" of the spin glass measure. In the glassy\n\n4\n\n\fphase, the distribution on the random graphs decomposes into an exponential number of \"lumps\". One of\nthe standard techniques for determining the glassy phase is via \"replica symmetry breaking\". Moreover,\nthere are certain glassy phases for which the replica symmetry breaking is relatively simple-those which\nare said to have \"one-step replica symmetry breaking\"; and others in which the replica symmetry breaking\nis more complicated-those with so-called \"full replica symmetry breaking\".\nIn a recent paper [17] it is claimed that the parameters for which a \"glassy phase occurs\" are exactly the\nsame as the parameters for which the reconstruction problem is not solvable. More formally, for determining\nif the glassy phase occurs for random (b + 1)-regular graphs and Gibbs measures with some parameters, one\nneeds to check if the reconstruction problem for the b-ary tree and associated parameters is solvable or not.\nFurthermore, it is claimed in [17] that the reconstruction problem determines the type of glassy phase as\nfollows. Mezard and Montanari predict that one-step replica symmetry breaking occurs exactly when when\nthe Kesten-Stigum bound is not equal to the reconstruction bound; otherwise full replica symmetry breaking\noccurs.\nThus our results proved here, in conjunction with the theoretical physics predictions of [17], suggest the\nexistence of two types of glassy phases for spin systems on random graphs. It is an interesting challenge to\nstate these predictions in a rigorous mathematical way and to prove or disprove them.\n\n2 Preliminaries and General Result\nFor convenience, we sometimes write the channel\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 \u03b5+ \u03b5+\nM=\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03b5\u2212 \u03b5\u2212\nNote first that the stationary distribution \u03c0 = (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) of M is given by\n\u03c0+ =\n\n1\n\u03b4\n1 \u2212 \u03b5\u2212\n= \u2212\n,\n1\u2212\u03b8\n2 2(1 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\n\u03c0\u2212 =\n\n\u03b5+\n1\n\u03b4\n= +\n.\n1\u2212\u03b8\n2 2(1 \u2212 \u03b8)\n\nIn particular, this expression implies that the stationary distribution depends only on the ratio \u03b4/(1 \u2212 \u03b8). Or\nput differently, each two of the parameters \u03c0+ , \u03b4 and \u03b8 determine the third one uniquely. Note also that\n\u03b4\n.\n1\u2212\u03b8\nWithout loss of generality, we assume throughout that \u03c0\u2212 \u2265 \u03c0+ or equivalently that \u03b4 \u2265 0. (Note that \u03b4 can\nbe made negative by inverting the role of + and \u2212.) Below, we will use the notation\n\u03b8 = \u03b5\u2212 \u2212 \u03b5+ ,\n\n\u03c0\u2212 \u2212 \u03c0+ =\n\n\u22121\n,\n\u03c0\u2212/+ \u2261 \u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+\n\n\u2206 \u2261 \u03c0\u2212/+ \u2212 1.\n\n2.1 General Trees\nIn this section, we state our Theorem in a more general setting. Namely, we consider general rooted trees\nwhere different edges are equipped with different transition matrices-all having the same stationary distribution \u03c0 = (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ). In other words, we consider a general infinite rooted tree T = (V, E) equipped with a\nfunction \u03b8 : E \u2192 [\u22121, 1] such that the edge e of the tree is equipped with the matrix M e with \u03b8(M e ) = \u03b8(e)\nand the stationary distribution of M e is (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ).\nIn this general setting the notion of degree is extended to the notion of branching number. In [7],\nFurstenberg introduced the Hausdorff dimension of a tree. Later, Lyons [13, 14] showed that many probabilistic properties of the tree are determined by this number which he named the branching number. For our\npurposes it is best to define the branching number via cutsets.\n5\n\n\fDefinition 2 (Cutsets) A cutset S for a tree T rooted at \u03c1, is a finite set of vertices separating \u03c1 from \u221e. In\nother words, a finite set S is a cutset if every infinite self avoiding path from \u03c1 intersects S. An antichain or\nminimal cutset is a cutset that does not have any proper subset which is also a cutset.\nDefinition 3 (Branching Number) Consider a rooted tree T = (V, E, \u03c1) equipped with an edge function\n\u03b8 : E \u2192 [\u22121, 1]. For each vertex v \u2208 V we define\nY\n\u03b7(x) =\n\u03b8 2 (e),\ne\u2208path(\u03c1,x)\n\nwhere path(\u03c1, x) is the set of edges on the unique path between \u03c1 and x in T . The branching number\nbr(T , \u03b8) of (T , \u03b8) is defined as\n(\n)\nX\n\u2212|x|\nbr(T , \u03b8) = inf \u03bb > 0 : inf\n\u03b7(x)\u03bb\n=0 .\ncutsets S\n\nx\u2208S\n\nIn our main result we show\nTheorem 2 (Reconstructibility on General Trees) Let 0 \u2264 \u03b80 < 1. Then there exists \u03b40 > 0 such that,\nfor all distributions \u03c0 = (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) with max{|\u03b4(\u03c0, \u03b80 )|, |\u03b4(\u03c0, \u2212\u03b80 )|} < \u03b40 and for all trees (T , \u03b8) with\nsupe |\u03b8(e)| \u2264 \u03b80 and br(T , \u03b8) \u2264 1, the reconstruction problem is not solvable.\nIt is easy to see that the conditions of Theorem 2 hold for Tb if \u03b8(e) = \u03b8 for all e and b\u03b8 2 \u2264 1.\n\n2.2 Magnetization\nLet T be a finite tree rooted at x with edge function \u03b8. Let \u03c3 be the leaf states generated by the Markov\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\nchain on (T, \u03b8) with stationary distribution (\u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ). We denote by P+\nT , ET (resp. PT , ET , and PT , ET ) the\nprobability/expectation operators with respect to the measure on the leaves of T obtained by conditioning\nthe root to be + (resp. \u2212, and stationary). With a slight abuse of notation, we also write PT [+ | \u03c3] for the\nprobability that the state at the the root of T is + given state \u03c3 at the leaves. The main random variable we\nconsider is the weighted magnetization of the root\n\u22121\n[\u03c0\u2212 PT [+ | \u03c3] \u2212 \u03c0+ PT [\u2212 | \u03c3]] .\nX = \u03c0\u2212\n\nNote that the weights are chosen to guarantee\n\u22121\n[\u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+ \u2212 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 ] = 0,\nET [X] = \u03c0\u2212\n\u22121\nis such that |X| \u2264 1 with probability 1.\nwhile the factor \u03c0\u2212\nNote that for any random variable depending only on the leaf states, f = f (\u03c3), we have \u03c0+ E+\nT [f ] +\n[f\n]\n=\nE\n[f\n],\nso\nthat\nin\nparticular\n\u03c0\u2212 E \u2212\nT\nT\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c0+ E +\nT [X ] + \u03c0\u2212 ET [X ] = ET [X ].\n\n\u2212\n\u03c0+ E +\nT [X] + \u03c0\u2212 ET [X] = ET [X] = 0,\n\nWe define the following analogues of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter for spin glasses on trees rooted\nat x\n2\n2\nx\u0304\u2212 = E\u2212\nx\u0304 = ET [X 2 ],\nx\u0304+ = E+\nT [X ].\nT [X ],\n\n6\n\n\fx\ny\n\ne\n\nT\u2032\n\nFigure 1: A finite tree T .\nNow suppose T is an infinite tree rooted at \u03c1 with edge function \u03b8.

Let Y be the weighted magnetization at the root of T \u2032 . See Figure 1. Denote by \u03c3 the leaf states\nof T and let \u03c3 \u2032 be the restriction of \u03c3 to the leaves of T \u2032 .

Let T \u2032 (resp. T \u2032\u2032 ) be a finite tree rooted at y (resp. z) with edge\nfunction \u03b8 \u2032 (resp. \u03b8 \u2032\u2032 ), leaf state \u03c3 \u2032 (resp. \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 ), and weighted magnetization at the root Y (resp. Z). Now\nadd an edge e = (\u0177, z) with edge value \u03b8(e) = \u03b8 to T \u2032\u2032 to obtain a new tree Tb. Then merge Tb with T \u2032 by\nidentifying y = \u0177 to obtain a new tree T . To avoid ambiguities, we denote by x the root of T and X the\nmagnetization of the root of T (where we identify the edge function on T with those on T \u2032 , T \u2032\u2032 , and e). We\nlet \u03c3 = (\u03c3 \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 ) be the leaf state of T . See Figure 2.

Note first that, by Lemmas 1, 2 and 3, we have\n2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\nETb [Yb 2 ] = E+b [Yb ] = \u03b8E+b [Z] = \u03b8 2 E+\nT \u2032\u2032 [Z] = \u03b8 ET [Z ],\nT\n\nT\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that \u03c0\u2212/+ = 1 when \u03b4 = 0 (although note that it is not needed). In other words,\nadding an edge to the root of a tree and re-rooting at the new vertex has the effect of multiplying the second\nmoment of the magnetization by \u03b8 2 . Now consider the Add-Merge operation defined in Section 3. Using the\nexpansion\n1\nr2\n=1\u2212r+\n,\n(8)\n1+r\n1+r\nthe inequality |X| \u2264 1, and Lemma 4, we get\nX = Y + Yb \u2212 Y Yb (Y + Yb ) + Y 2 Yb 2 X \u2264 Y + Yb \u2212 Y Yb (Y + Yb ) + Y 2 Yb 2 .\n\nNote that from Lemmas 1 and 2, we have\nE+\nT [X] = x\u0304,\n\n+\n2\nE+\nT [Y ] = ET [Y ] = \u0233,\n\n10\n\n+ b2\n2\nb\nE+\nT [Y ] = ET [Y ] = \u03b8 z\u0304,\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere we have used that \u0233+ = \u0233\u2212 = \u0233 and z\u0304+ = z\u0304\u2212 = z\u0304 by symmetry. Taking E+\nT on both sides of (9), we\nget\nx\u0304 \u2264 \u0233 + \u03b8 2 z\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304 + \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304 = \u0233 + \u03b8 2 z\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304.\nNow, let Tn = (Vn , En , xn ) be as in Section 2.2. Repeating the Add-Merge operation (b \u2212 1) times, we\nfinally have by induction\nx\u0304n \u2264 b\u03b8 2 x\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 (b \u2212 1)\u03b8 4 x\u03042n\u22121 .\nIndeed, note that for 0 < a < b,\n(a\u03b8 2 x\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 (a \u2212 1)\u03b8 4 x\u03042n\u22121 ) + \u03b8 2 x\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 \u03b8 2 (a\u03b8 2 x\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 (a \u2212 1)\u03b8 4 x\u03042n\u22121 )x\u0304n\u22121 \u2264 (a + 1)\u03b8 2 x\u0304n\u22121 \u2212 a\u03b8 4 x\u03042n\u22121 ,\nand the first step of the induction is given by (7). This concludes the proof. \u0004\n\n5 Roughly Symmetric Channels on General Trees\nWe now tackle the general case. We start by analyzing the Add-Merge operation.\nProposition 1 (Basic Inequality) Consider the setup of Section 3. Assume |\u03b8| < 1. Then, there is a\n\u03b40 (|\u03b8|) > 0 depending only on |\u03b8| such that\nx\u0304 \u2264 \u0233 + \u03b8 2 z\u0304,\nwhenever \u03b4 (on e) is less than \u03b40 (|\u03b8|).\nProof: The proof is similar to that in the symmetric case. By expansion (8), inequality |X| \u2264 1, and\nLemma 4, we have\n2\nX \u2264 Y + Yb + \u2206Y Yb \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+ Y Yb (Y + Yb + \u2206Y Yb ) + \u03c0\u2212/+\nY 2 Yb 2 .\n\nLet \u03c1\u2032 = (\u0233)\u22121 \u0233+ and \u03c1\u2032\u2032 = (z\u0304)\u22121 z\u0304+ . Then, by Lemmas 1 and 2, we have\n\n2\n\u2032\nE+\nE+\nE+\nT [Y ] = \u0233\u03c1 ,\nT [Y ] = \u03c0\u2212/+ \u0233,\nT [X] = \u03c0\u2212/+ x\u0304,\nE+ [Yb ] = \u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 z\u0304, E+ [Yb 2 ] = \u03b8 2 z\u0304[(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ].\nT\n\nT\n\n\u22121\nE+\nTaking \u03c0\u2212/+\nT on both sides of (10), we get\n\nx\u0304 \u2264 \u0233 + \u03b8 2 z\u0304 + \u2206\u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304\n\n\u2212\u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304\u03c1\u2032 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304[(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ] \u2212 \u2206\u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304\u03c1\u2032 [(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ]\n+\u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304\u03c1\u2032 [(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ]\n\n\u2264 \u0233 + \u03b8 2 z\u0304 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+ \u03b8 2 \u0233z\u0304[A \u2212 \u2206B],\nwhere\n\nA = \u03c1\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u2032 )[(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ],\n\n11\n\n(10)\n\n\fand\n\u22121\n\u03c1\u2032 [(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ].\nB = 1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+\n\nNote that [(1 \u2212 \u03b8) + \u03b8\u03c1\u2032\u2032 ] \u2265 0 by Lemma 2. So B \u2264 1 and it suffices to have A \u2265 \u2206. Note also that A\nis multilinear in (\u03c1\u2032 , \u03c1\u2032\u2032 ). Therefore, to minimize A, we only need to consider extreme cases in (\u03c1\u2032 , \u03c1\u2032\u2032 ). By\n\u22121\n. The same holds for \u03c1\u2032\u2032 . At \u03c1\u2032 = 0, we have\n\u03c0+ y + + \u03c0\u2212 y \u2212 = y it follows that 0 \u2264 \u03c1\u2032 \u2264 \u03c0+\n\u001a\n1 \u2212 \u03b8,\nif \u03b8 \u2265 0,\n\u2032\u2032\nA = 1 \u2212 \u03b8[1 \u2212 \u03c1 ] \u2265\n1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+ |\u03b8|, if \u03b8 \u2264 0,\nwhere we have used\n\u22121\n= \u2212\u03c0\u2212/+ .\n1 \u2212 \u03c0+\n\u22121\n, we have\nAt \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c0+\n\nA=\n\n\u22121\n\u03c0+\n\n+ (1 \u2212\n\n\u22121\n)[1\n\u03c0+\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2212 \u03b8[1 \u2212 \u03c1 ]] = 1 + \u03b8\u03c0\u2212/+ [1 \u2212 \u03c1 ] \u2265\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+\n\u03b8, if \u03b8 \u2265 0,\n1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+ |\u03b8|, if \u03b8 \u2264 0.\n\nSince \u03c0\u2212/+ \u2265 1 by assumption, it follows that\n2\nA \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2212/+\n|\u03b8|.\n\nAt \u03b4 = 0, this bound is strictly positive and moreover \u2206 = 0. Therefore, by continuity in \u03b4 of \u2206 and the\nbound above, the result follows. \u0004\nProposition 2 (Induction Step) Let T be a finite tree rooted at x with edge function \u03b8. Let w1 , . . . , w\u03b1 be\nthe children of x in T and denote by ea the edge connecting x to wa . Let \u03b80 = max{|\u03b8(e1 )|, . . . , |\u03b8(e\u03b1 )|}\nand assume that on each edge ea , \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40 (\u03b80 ), where \u03b40 is defined in Proposition 1. Then\nx\u0304 \u2264\n\n\u03b1\nX\n\n\u03b8(ea )2 w\u0304a .\n\na=1\n\nProof: As noted in the proof of Theorem 3, adding an edge e to the root of a tree and re-rooting at the new\nvertex has the effect of multiplying the second moment of the magnetization by \u03b8 2 (e). The result follows\nby applying Proposition 1 (\u03b1 \u2212 1) times. \u0004\nProof of Theorem 2: It suffices to show that for all \u03b5 > 0 there is an N large enough so that x\u0304n \u2264 \u03b5,\n\u2200n \u2265 N . Fix \u03b5 > 0. By definition of the branching number, there exists a cutset S of T such that\nX\n\u03b7(u) \u2264 \u03b5.\nu\u2208S\n\nAssume w.l.o.g. that S is actually an antichain and let N be such that S is in TN . It is enough to show that\nX\nx\u0304n \u2264\n\u03b7(u),\n\u2200 n \u2265 N.\nu\u2208S\n\nFix n \u2265 N . Applying Proposition 2 repeatedly from the root of Tn down to S, it is clear that\nX\nX\nx\u0304n \u2264\n\u03b7(u)ETn (u) [U 2 ] \u2264\n\u03b7(u),\nu\u2208S\n\nu\u2208S\n\nwhere Tn (u) is the subtree of Tn rooted at u and U is the magnetization at u on Tn (u) (with |U | \u2264 1). This\nconcludes the proof. \u0004\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] N. Berger, C. Kenyon, E. Mossel, and Y. Peres. Glauber dynamics on trees and hyperbolic graphs.\nProbab.
