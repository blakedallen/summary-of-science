Introduction\nSupermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses in the\nrange of 106 to 109 M\u2299 , have been suggested to exist in\nthe center of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nAccretion onto these SMBHs may account for the huge\npower of these energetic objects (Lynden-Bell 1969; Rees\n1984). Recently, the masses of central objects in 20 Seyfert\ngalaxies and 17 nearby quasars have been measured with\nthe reverberation mapping technique (Ho 1999; Wandel,\nPeterson & Malkan 1999; Kaspi et al. 2000), which confirmed the existence of SMBHs in the center of these\nobjects. On the other hand, a lot of observations using\ngas and stellar dynamics indicated that SMBHs probably\nalso exist in the center of our Galaxy (Ghez et al. 1998;\nGenzel et al. 1997) and in the nuclei of many normal\ngalaxies (Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al.\n1998; Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001). However, the apparent inactive feature of normal galaxies seems to suggest\nthat the central engines of these galaxies may be differSend offprint requests to: Xue-Bing Wu\n\nent from those in quasars and AGNs. It was suspected\nthat advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs; see\nNarayan, Mahadevan & Quataert 1998 and Kato, Fukue\n& Mineshige 1998 for reviews) with very low accretion rate\nand low radiative efficiency may exist in the nuclei of normal galaxies (Fabian & Rees 1995; Di Matteo & Fabian\n1996), while quasars and most AGNs probably host the\nstandard geometrically thin accretion disks (Shakura &\nSunyaev 1973; Novikov & Throne 1973) with higher accretion rate.\nOne interesting result found recently in the searches of\nSMBHs in nearby galaxies is the correlation of black hole\nmasses with the properties of galactic bulges. Although\nwith large scatters, the black hole masses seem to correlate with bulge luminosities (Kormendy 1993; Kormendy\n& Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998). This also leads\nto the finding that the black hole mass, MBH , is possibly\nproportional to the bulge mass, Mbulge , though the mass\nratio found by different authors was different, in the range\nof 0.2% to 0.6% (Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian\net al. 1998; Ho 1999). Laor (1998; 2001) recently found\n\n\f2\n\nXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\nthat some nearby quasars and Seyfert galaxies follow\nnearly the same MBH -bulge luminosity relation as normal galaxies, and suggested a universal nonlinear relation,\n1.54\u00b10.15\nMBH \u221d Mbulge\n, for both normal and active galaxies.\nThis means that the MBH /Mbulge ratio is not constant for\ngalaxies with different bulge luminosities. Recently, a significantly tight correlation of MBH with the bulge velocity\ndispersion \u03c3 was also found for nearby galaxies (Gebhardt\net al. 2000a; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000). More recent studies indicated that 11 Seyfert galaxies with MBH measured\nby reverberation mapping follow the same MBH -\u03c3 relation\nas for normal galaxies (Gebhardt et al. 2000b; Ferrarese\net al. 2001), implying another possible universal relation\nfor both normal and active galaxies. The correlations of\nthe SMBH mass with the properties of the galactic bulge\nstrongly suggest a tight connection between the formation\nand evolution of the SMBH and galactic bulge, though\nthe nature of this connection is still in debate (Haehnelt\n& Rees 1993; Haiman & Loeb 1998; Silk & Rees 1998;\nHaehnelt, Natarajan & Rees 1998; Kauffmann & Haehnelt\n2000; Adams, Graff & Richstone 2001)\nNonthermal radio emissions of quasars and AGNs are\nbelieved to be probably produced by relativistic electrons\nthat are powered by jets (Begelman, Blandford & Rees\n1984; Blundel & Beasley 1998). Similar radio emissions\nhave been detected in the nuclei of normal elliptical galaxies (Sadler, Jenkins & Kotanyi 1989) and also in some spiral galaxies (Sadler et al. 1995). Recently, some studies\nhave indicated that the radio power may be directly correlated with the black hole mass. Franceschini, Vercellone &\nFabian (1998) found a very tight relation between black\nhole mass and radio power in a small sample of nearby\nmostly non-active galaxies. McLure et al. (1999) estimated the black hole masses for a sample of AGNs using MBH -bulge mass relation found by Magorrian et al.\n(1998) and noted they follow the same correlation with radio power as found by Franceschini et al. (1998). However,\nLaor (2000) recently argued that the MBH and radio power\nof a sample of 87 z < 0.5 Palomar-Green (PG) quasars\n(Schmidt & Green 1983; Boroson & Green 1992) do not\nfollow the tight correlation suggested by Franceschini et\nal. (1998), because quasars usually have over 100 times\nlarger radio power than normal galaxies at a given MBH .\nHe suggested that the larger scatters of radio power at\na given MBH may be simply due to the different levels\nof overall continuum luminosity of different objects. Laor\n(2000) also noted that the radio-loud quasars seem to host\nmore massive black holes than radio-quiet quasars. Very\nrecently, Ho & Peng (2001) studied the radio-loudness\nof bright Seyfert 1 galaxies using the nuclear radio and\noptical luminosities, and suggested that the majority of\nSeyfert 1 nuclei in their sample are essentially radio loud.\nTherefore, it is useful and feasible to check if these radioloud Seyfert nuclei host more massive black holes than\nradio-quiet ones and if the Seyfert galaxies still follow the\nsame correlation between the radio power and black hole\nmasses of nearby galaxies and quasars (Franceschini et al.\n1998; Laor 2000). In this paper we will try to derive the\n\nFig. 1. The black hole mass (in M\u2299 ) against the velocity dispersion for Seyfert galaxies. Squares and triangles\nrepresent the SMBH masses measured by reverberation\nmapping and stellar/gas dynamics, respectively.

Estimating the SMBH masses of Seyfert\ngalaxies\nCurrently the SMBH masses of a few weak AGNs have\nbeen well measured by stellar dynamics, ionized gas dynamics and water maser dynamics (for a summary see\nTable 1s in Ho 1999 and Gebhardt et al. 2000a). Using\nthe reverberation mapping technique, the SMBH masses\nof 20 Seyfert galaxies and 17 bright quasars have been recently estimated (Ho 1999; Wandel et al. 1999; Kaspi et\nal. 2000). However, for most Seyfert galaxies, it is difficult\nto measure the SMBH mass using these methods because\nof either the large nuclear luminosity or the lack of longterm variability monitoring and precise measurements of\ncharacteristic velocity dispersions in the broad emission\nline region.\nSince the tight correlation between the SMBH mass\nand bulge velocity dispersion was found for both normal\nand active galaxies (Gebhardt et al. 2000b; Ferrarese\net al. 2001), it may be straightforward to estimate the\n\n\fXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\n3\n\nSMBH mass from the measured bulge velocity dispersion.\nThe correlation between the black hole mass and nuclear\nvelocity dispersion for Seyfert galaxies with both measured nuclear velocity dispersions and black hole masses\nis demonstrated in Figure 1. The SMBH masses of 11\nSeyfert galaxies (squares in Figure 1) were estimated by\nreverberation mapping (Wandel et al. 1999) and 9 (triangles in Figure 1) by the dynamical method (Ho 1999;\nGebhardt et al. 2000a). The values of their central velocity dispersions were taken from Nelson & Whittle (1995)\nand Ferrarese et al. (2001). Figure 1 clearly shows that\nSeyfert galaxies follow the same MBH -\u03c3 relation as normal galaxies (Gebhardt et al. 2000a; Merritt & Ferrarese\n2000). Although measurements of the central velocity dispersions of these Seyfert galaxies were made by different\ngroups, the small scattering around the MBH -\u03c3 relation\nindicates that these measurements were reliable and the\nsystematic errors may not be important (Ferrarese et al.\n2001). In this paper, we adopt the MBH -\u03c3 relation found\nby Merritt & Ferrarese (2001), namely,\nMBH = 1.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (\u03c3/200 km s\u22121 )4.72 ,\n\n(1)\n\nto derive the SMBH masses for Seyfert galaxies with measured nuclear velocity dispersions. Using a slightly flatter\nrelation found by Gebhardt et al. (2000) does not cause\nsignificant changes in our results.\nIn the next sections we will compare some properties of\nSeyfert galaxies with those of quasars. Only a few quasars\nhave SMBH masses determined by reverberation mapping.\nLaor (1998) adopted an empirical relation between the size\nof the broad line region (BLR) and the bolometric luminosity, RBLR \u221d L1/2 (Kaspi et al. 1996; see also Kaspi\net al. 2000 for a slightly steeper relation), and derived the\nSMBH mass for a number of quasars using the measured\nH\u03b2 velocity dispersion and the continuum luminosity. We\nhave compared the estimated SMBH masses for 9 Seyfert\ngalaxies using\n\u221a Laor's method (but adopted the BLR velocity V = ( 3/2)FWHM(H\u03b2), as did Kaspi et al. (2000))\nwith the those obtained by reverberation mapping, and\nfound that they agree well. This shows that using SMBH\nmasses derived with different methods may not cause serious problems in our present work.\n\n3. Sample of Seyfert galaxies\nWe selected 37 Seyfert galaxies from two well-studied\nnearby Seyfert samples, the Palomar optical spectroscopic\nsurvey of bright (BT \u2264 12.5mag), northern (\u03b4 > 0o ) galaxies (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1995), including 21 Seyfert\n1s and 28 Seyfert 2s (Ho et al. 1997a), the most complete and least biased available (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent\n1997b; Ho & Ulvestad 2001), and the CfA redshift Survey\n(Huchra et al. 1983) of galaxies with Zwicky magnitude\n\u2264 14.5, including 33 Seyfert 1s and 15 Seyfert 2s (Huchra\n& Burg 1992; Osterbrock & Martel 1993). The Seyfert\nsamples from these two surveys seem to complement one\nanother, though the combined sample may not be complete (Ho & Peng 2001).\n\nFig. 2. The nuclear radio-loudness and the nuclear radio\npower against the black hole masses for Seyfert galaxies.\nThe dashed line in the lower panel represents the tight\ncorrelation between the core radio power and the SMBH\nmasses for nearby galaxies found by Franceschini et al.\n(1998).\nOur Seyfert sample include 22 Seyfert 1s and 15 Seyfert\n2s in Palomar and CfA samples (see Table 1). These\nSeyfert galaxies have either the measured SMBH masses\nor the measured central velocity dispersions. Among them,\nthree Seyfert 1s and two Seyfert 2s have dynamical SMBH\nmasses (Ho 1999; Gebhardt et al. 2000a), and ten Seyfert\n1s have SMBH masses measured by the reverberation\nmapping method (Wandel et al. 1999; Ho 1999). Another\nNine Seyfert 1s and 13 Seyfert 2s have measured central\nvelocity dispersions but unknown SMBH masses (Nelson\n& Whittle 1995). The SMBH masses can be estimated by\nequation (1) using the measured central velocity dispersions. Therefore, our sample consists of 37 Seyfert galaxies\nwith derived SMBH masses (see Table 1).\n\n4.

In this paper, we adopt the radio data\nfor Seyfert 1s from Ho & Peng (2001) and the data for\nSeyfert 2s from Ho & Ulvestad (2001) and Kukula et al.\n(1995). The 6 cm data for some sources in the CfA sample\n(Kukula et al. 1995) were extrapolated from the 3.6cm\ndata assuming f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.5 .\nSeyfert galaxies have been considered usually as radioquiet AGNs because most of them have lower radioloudness, defined as the ratio of the radio to optical luminosities, R = L6cm /LB . However, a recently study of\nHo & Peng (2001) showed that though the nuclear radio power for Seyfert 1 galaxies on average accounts for\nabout 75% of the total radio emission, the nuclear optical luminosity, measured by high-resolution optical im-\n\nages, accounts for merely 0.01% of the integrated light. If\nthe radio-loudness is measured by the nuclear radio and\noptical luminosities, most Seyfert 1s are in the category\nof radio-loud AGNs (with radio-loudness larger than 10).\nIn Table 1, we listed the total and nuclear absolute B\nmagnitudes (MBtot and MBnuc ) and nuclear radio power\n(P6cm ) for Seyfert galaxies. The nuclear radio-loudness,\nnuc\nRc , is calculated by Rc = Lnuc\n6cm /LB . The Hubble con\u22121\n\u22121\nstant H0 = 75kms Mpc and the deceleration parameter of q0 = 0.5 were adopted. For Seyfert 2s, the measurements of their nuclear optical magnitudes are not available\nin the literature.\nFigure 2 shows the relation of SMBH masses with the\nnuclear radio-loudness of Seyfert 1s and the radio power of\nSeyfert galaxies listed in Table 1. It is clear that the radio-\n\n\fXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\n5\n\nloud Seyfert 1s with larger nuclear radio-loudness seem to\nhost more massive black holes. The similar tendency has\nbeen found for PG quasars by Laor (2000). From Figure\n2(b) we see a trend that Seyfert galaxies having a larger\nradio power perhaps host a more massive black hole than\nthose of less radio power. With the same black hole mass,\nSeyfert galaxies seem to have 100 to 1000 times greater\nradio power than normal galaxies. Laor (2000) has shown\nthat PG quasars also depart from such a correlation for\nnearby galaxies, with the radio luminosity of quasars being\n104 larger at a given MBH . The difference of radio luminosities of quasars, Seyfert galaxies and nearby galaxies\nmay be simply due to different levels of nuclear activity.\n\n5. Black hole masses and bulge luminosities\nThe correlation of black hole mass and galactic bulge\nluminosity found for nearby galaxies implies a relationship between the black hole and bulge masses (Kormendy\n& Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998; Ho 1999).\nHowever, it is not clear whether the ratio between black\nhole and bulge masses remains constant for all kinds of\nobjects. Laor (2001) recently checked the correlation between the estimated black masses and bulge luminosities\nfor 15 nearby quasars and 9 Seyfert galaxies, and found\nthat they probably follow the same MBH -bulge luminosity\nrelation as for 16 nearby galaxies. This suggests a universal nonlinear relation between the estimated black masses\n1.54\u00b10.15\n, for both norand bulge luminosities, MBH \u221d Mbulge\nmal and active galaxies. Therefore, MBH /Mbulge ratio is\nnot constant for galaxies with different bulge luminosities.\nHowever, this needs to be confirmed by larger samples including both normal and active galaxies.\n\n5.1. Our sample of Seyfert galaxies\nWe use the 37 Seyfert galaxies with derived SMBH masses\nin our sample to check the MBH /Mbulge ratio. The absolute total B magnitudes (Mtot\nB ) for our Seyfert sample (see Table 1) were taken from Ho et al. (1997b)\nand Whittle (1992) (adapted to H0 = 75kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ).\nThe absolute bulge B magnitudes (Mbulge\n) were obtained\nB\nbulge\nbased on the relation between MB\nand Mtot\nB (Simien &\nde Vaucouleurs 1986) and the Hubble stages (defined in\nde Vaucouleurs, de Vaucouleurs & Corwin 1976) of the\nhost galaxies. The B-V colors were taken from Ver\u00f3nCettty & Ver\u00f3n (2000). In order to compare our result\nwith those obtained for quasars and nearby galaxies, we\nconvert MBbulge of Seyfert galaxies to the absolute bulge V\nmagnitude, MVbulge (adapted to H0 = 80kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) by\nassuming that B-V color in the bulge is nearly the same as\nthe total B-V color of Seyfert galaxy. In Figure 3 we show\nthe relation between the SMBH masses and bulge V-band\nabsolute magnitudes for Seyfert galaxies and the comparison of this relation with those for quasars and nearby\ngalaxies. The SMBH masses of 15 quasars and the absolute V magnitudes of their inner host were taken from Laor\n\nFig. 3. Correlation of V-band bulge absolute magnitudes\nand SMBH masses for Seyfert galaxies, quasars and normal galaxies. The solid line represents the least \u03c72 fit to\nall objects by considering typical measurement errors of\nboth parameters.\n\n(1998, 2001).1 The SMBH masses determined by stellar\nand gas dynamics for 33 nearby galaxies were taken from\nKormendy & Gebhardt (2001) (we omitted M 81, a Seyfert\n1 already in our Seyfert sample, and 3 objects with black\nhole masses measured by maser dynamics). Their absolute\nbulge V magnitudes were derived from B-band absolute\nbulge magnitudes by adopting a standard bulge color, BV = 0.94 (Worthey 1994). It is evident that both Seyfert\nand nearby galaxies, as well as quasars, seem to follow\nthe same Mbulge\n-MBH relation. Note that unlike others,\nV\nnearby galaxies NGC 4342, NGC 4486B and M 32 deviate significantly from the Mbulge\n-MBH relation. These\nV\noffset galaxies are usually fainter because the outer regions of them may have been stripped away in the tidal\ninteractions with more massive companions (Faber 1973).\nThese three galaxies, together with two Seyfert 1 galaxies, NGC 1275 with peculiar Hubble type and NGC 4395\nwith only the upper limit of measured SMBH mass, are\nnot included in our statistical studies. The measurement\nerrors of MBH /M\u2299 of our Seyfert sample were listed in\nTable 1, and those of normal galaxies were adopted from\nKormendy & Gebhardt (2001). For nearby quasars, such\nerrors are not available in Laor (1998) and assumed to be\n60%. The measurement errors of Mbulge\nwere seldom menV\n1\n\u221a Because we used BLR velocity dispersion as V =\n( 3/2)FWHM(H\u03b2), the SMBH masses of 15 quasars are\nsmaller by a factor of 0.75 than those given by Laor (1998).\n\n\f6\n\nXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\ntioned in the literature and thus are difficult to estimate.\nThese errors for Seyfert galaxies were allocated to be 0.5,\n0.75 and 1.0 mag respectively based on their quality assessment factors (Whittle 1992). Those of normal galaxies\nand nearby quasars were adopted to be 0.5 and 0.75 mag,\nrespectively. Taking into account these 'typical' errors of\nMbulge\nand MBH , the least \u03c72 fit for 35 Seyfert galaxies,\nV\n15 quasars and 30 normal galaxies gives:\nMVbulge = \u221211.01 \u00b1 0.78 \u2212 (1.22 \u00b1 0.10)log(MBH /M\u2299 ).(2)\nThe Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is rS =\n\u22120.76, which has a probability of Pr = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u221216 occuring by chance. Considering the errors in both parameters,\nwe adopted a bootstrap method to estimate the uncertainty of this correlation, and obtained the mean correlation coefficient hrS i = \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.05. Using the standard\nrelation\nMVbulge = 4.83 \u2212 2.5logLbulge /L\u2299 ,\n\n(3)\n\nand the relation between the bulge mass and luminosity\n(Magorrian et al. 1998),\nlog(Mbulge /M\u2299 ) = \u22121.11 + 1.18log(Lbulge /L\u2299 ),\n\n(4)\n\nwe then can get from eq. (2),\nlog(MBH /Mbulge ) = \u221211.06 \u00b1 1.11 + (0.74 \u00b1 0.14)\nlog(Mbulge /M\u2299 ).\n\n(5)\n\n1.74\u00b10.14\nThis gives MBH \u221d Mbulge\n. The fitting for a sample of 35 Seyfert galaxies and 30 normal galaxies alone\ngives almost identical results. Laor (2001) recently found\n1.54\u00b10.15\nMBH \u221d Mbulge\nfor a sample of objects including 9\nSeyfert galaxies and 15 quasars. Our result shows that\nthis nonlinear relation is more evident from a larger sample including more Seyfert galaxies. Eq. (5) also shows\nthat MBH /Mbulge is about 0.02 when MBH = 106 M\u2299 ,\nand is 0.3% when MBH = 109 M\u2299 . This clearly indicates\nthat galaxies with more massive black holes have a larger\nMBH /Mbulge ratio.\n\n5.2. Seyfert sample in reverberation mapping studies\nMbulge\n-MBH\nV\n\nWe noted that the above universal\nrelation\n(eq. 2) is contrary to the result obtained by Wandel (1999),\nwho found that Seyfert 1 galaxies significantly depart from\nthe Lbulge -MBH relations of quasars and nearby galaxies\n( Laor 1998; Magorrian et al. 1998). However, Mclure\n& Dunlop (2001) used the decomposed bulge luminosities of the same sample of Seyfert galaxies as in Wandel\n(1999) and found no evidence for a different Lbulge -MBH\nrelation from quasars. We noted that Wandel (1999) took\nthe absolute bulge B magnitude, Mbulge\n, for Seyfert galaxB\nies from Whittle (1992)(adopting H0 = 50kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 )\nand calculated the bulge luminosity from MBbulge with the\nstandard expression for Mbulge\n(see eq. (3)) by assumV\nbulge\nbulge\ning MB\n\u2243 MV\nfor Seyfert 1s. We carefully checked\n\nFig. 4.

The Mbulge\n-MBH relation of 17 Seyfert 1 galaxies,\nV\nas compared with those for 15 quasars (Laor 1998, 2001)\nand 30 nearby galaxies with MBH measured by stellar dynamics (Gebhardt et al. 2000a), is shown in Figure 4.\nAllocating the 'typical' uncertainties of Mbulge\nand MBH\nV\nas we did above, the least \u03c72 fit for 62 objects gives,\nMVbulge = \u221210.00 \u00b1 0.96 \u2212 (1.34 \u00b1 0.12)log(MBH /M\u2299 ).(6)\nConsidering the errors in both parameters, we estimated\nthe mean correlation coefficient as hrS i = \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.06.\nThis result is consistent with that found above (see eq.\n(2)) and also indicates a nonlinear MBH -Mbulge relation.\n\n5.3. Nelson & Whittle's sample of Seyfert galaxies\nIn this section we explore the Seyfert sample in Nelson\n& Whittle (1995), where the measurements of nuclear velocity dispersions of about 70 Seyfert galaxies were reported. After excluding several LINERs and normal galaxies, we got 33 Seyfert 1s and 32 Seyfert 2s. We estimated the SMBH masses of these Seyfert galaxies using\nthe MBH -\u03c3 relation (eq. (1)).

The dashed line in (b) represents\nthe tight correlation between total radio power and SMBH\nmasses found by Franceschini et al. (1998) for nearby\ngalaxies.\n\n5 GHz of them was calculated from the 1.4 GHz data\nin Nelson & Whittle (1995) by assuming f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22120.5\nand H0 = 80kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The radio-loudness was calculated by the 5 GHz radio luminosity and the B-band\noptical luminosity. The V-band bulge absolute magnitude\nwas estimated from the B-band bulge absolute magnitude\n(adapted to H0 = 80kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) in Nelson & Whittle\n(1995) by assuming the B-V color of the bulge being the\nsame as the total B-V color (taken from Ver\u00f3n-Cetty &\nVer\u00f3n (2000)) of Seyfert galaxy.\nThe radio-loudness and total radio power against the\nSMBH masses for 29 Seyfert 1s and 25 Seyfert 2s with\navailable radio data in the sample of Nelson & Whittle\n(1995) are plotted in Fig. 5. Now we see that most Seyfert\ngalaxies seem to be radio quiet (R < 10) when we adopted\nthe total radio and optical luminosities to calculate the\nradio-loudness. There is a weak tendency that Seyfert\ngalaxies with larger radio-loudness have larger SMBH\nmasses. A comparison with the result in Figure 2(a) indicates that the nuclear radio-loudness may be more fundamental and reflect the nature of central engine of Seyfert\ngalaxies. From Figure 5(b) we see that there is a strong\ncorrelation between the total radio power and the SMBH\n\n7\n\nFig. 6.

This confirms again\nthe previous result that AGNs with larger radio power\nmay host more massive SMBHs (Franceschini et al. 1998;\nMcLure et al. 1999). However, as is shown in Figure 2,\nSeyfert galaxies depart significantly from the tight relation between the radio power and SMBH mass found for\nnormal galaxies by Franceschini et al. (1998).\nThe relation between V-band bulge luminosities and\nSMBH masses for 33 Seyfert 1s and 32 Seyfert 2s in the\nsample of Nelson & Whittle (1995) is shown in Figure 6.\nIt again indicates a significant universal relation between\nV-band bulge luminosities and SMBH masses for both\nSeyfert galaxies and quasars, as well as nearby galaxies.\nAdopting the 'typical' uncertainties of Mbulge\nand MBH as\nV\nwe did above, the least \u03c72 fit for 65 Seyfert galaxies, 15\nquasars and 30 nearby galaxies gives,\nMVbulge = \u221211.33 \u00b1 0.66 \u2212 (1.19 \u00b1 0.09)log(MBH /M\u2299 ),(7)\nThe simple Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is\nrS = \u22120.76, which has a probability of Pr = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221221\noccuring by chance. Considering the errors in both parameters, we estimated the mean correlation coefficient\nas hrS i = \u22120.61 \u00b1 0.04. This result is also almost identical to what we found for the sample including 35 Seyfert\ngalaxies. Therefore, the nonlinear MBH -Mbulge relation is\nconfirmed by the substantially enlarged Seyfert sample.\n\n\f8\n\nXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\n5.4. Effects of larger systematic errors\nA significant correlation between black hole mass and\nbulge luminosity was obtained above by considering the\n'typical' errors of both parameters. These errors are\nmainly due to the measurement uncertainties of bulge\nmagnitude and black hole mass. However, the systematic errors are probably substantially larger for both bulge\nmagnitude and black hole mass. For example, if MBH is determined by reverberation mapping, the systematic errors\ncaused by the unknown BLR geometry, inclination may\nbe as large as a factor of 3 or more (Krolik 2001). Using\nthe MBH -\u03c3 relation to estimate MBH also has larger systematic errors due to the uncertainty of the slope of this\nrelation. In addition, in deriving bulge magnitude from\ngalaxy magnitude for Seyfert galaxies we adopted a statistical relation given by Simien & de Vaucouleurs (1986).\nThe systematic errors caused by applying this relation are\nprobably quite large and are difficult to estimate quantitatively.\nIn order to estimate the effects of possible larger systematic errors of black hole mass and bulge magnitude on\nour result, we adopted a bootstrap method by adding the\nsystematic errors into the uncertainties of both parameters. Assuming the possible systematic errors for bulge\nabsolute magnitude being 1 mag and those for black hole\nmass being 90% for all 35 Seyfert galaxies, 15 quasars and\n30 normal galaxies, we obtained the average correlation\ncoefficient using the bootstrap approach as being hrS i =\n\u22120.40 \u00b1 0.09, which indicates a moderately significant correlation. The minimum chi-square fit considering both\nmeasurement and systematic errors in both parameter\ngives, Mbulge\n= \u221210.49\u00b11.77\u2212(1.29\u00b10.22)log(MBH /M\u2299 ).\nV\nComparing with the result we obtained in eq. (2), we\nfound the slope of this relation does not change very much,\nthough the uncertainty of the slope is doubled when the\nlarger systematic errors are considered. The correlation\ncoefficient also substantially decreases and its uncertainty\nincreases accordingly. However, these changes are quite\nlimited and have no significant effects on the result we\nhave obtained.\n\n6. Discussions\nOur results obtained for a larger sample of Seyfert galaxies\nshow that AGNs with a larger nuclear radio-loudness seem\nto have more massive black holes. This conclusion was obtained recently by Laor (2000) for nearby quasars and was\nsupported by our study for Seyfert galaxies. Our results\nalso strengthen the argument made by Ho & Peng (2001)\nthat the majority of Seyfert 1s are essentially radio-loud\nAGNs. The total radio power of Seyfert galaxies increases\nwith the black hole mass. At a given MBH , quasars and\nSeyfert galaxies seem to have greater radio power than\nthat of nearby galaxies. These difference may simply be\ndue to the different level of nuclear activity for different kinds of galaxies. A recent study using the quasars\nfrom the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey found evidence for\n\nthe dependence of radio-luminosity on accretion rate and\nSMBH mass (Lacy et al. 2001). This may help us to understand the origin of scatters in the relation between the\nradio power and SMBH mass. If we describe the nuclear\nactivity of galaxies using the accretion rate \u1e40 , the difference of radio power at a given MBH may show that quasars\nand Seyfert galaxies have larger \u1e40 than nearby galaxies.\nThis seems also consistent with the picture that the accretion process in these systems may be different (Fabian &\nRees 1995; Di Matteo & Fabian 1996). Most likely ADAFs\nwith very low accretion rate exist in the nuclei of nearby\ngalaxies, while quasars and most AGNs probably host\nstandard geometrically thin accretion disks with higher\naccretion rate. However, the radio emissions from radioquiet AGNs and nearby galaxies are not well understood\nat present. Whether they are from ADAFs (Narayan et al.\n1998) or from weak jets (Falcke & Biermann 1996, 1999)\nstill remains uncertain. For radio-loud AGNs, the radio\nemissions are thought to be mainly from the jet and are\nprobably related to the magnetic fields or black hole spin\n(Blandford & Payne 1982; Blandford & Znajek 1977). If\nthe radio emissions correlate with the black hole mass and\naccretion rate, we need to explain the possible relations of\nthese parameters with magnetic fields and black hole spin.\nHowever, no satisfactory theory can provide clear physics\nabout these relations at present.\nUsing the sample including 37 Seyfert galaxies in two\nwell-defined bright Seyfert samples, we studied the correlations of black hole masses with V-band bulge absolute magnitudes and bulge masses for active and normal\ngalaxies. We find that the correlation between the black\nhole masses and the V-band absolute bulge magnitudes\nfor Seyfert galaxies is almost consistent with those found\nfor quasars and nearby galaxies. The combined sample\nof 37 Seyfert galaxies, 15 quasars and 30 nearby galaxies\nseem to follow a universal nonlinear relation between the\n1.74\u00b10.14\n, which is\nblack hole and bulge masses, MBH \u221d Mbulge\nslightly steeper than that found recently by Laor (2001)\nfor a sample including 9 Seyfert galaxies. Our results support the suggestion that the ratio of MBH and Mbulge is\nnot constant and galaxies with larger bulge luminosities or\nmore massive SMBH probably have a larger MBH /Mbulge\nratio. Including 65 Seyfert galaxies in the larger sample of\nNelson & Whittle (1995) led to almost the same result. In\nfact, the nonlinear relation between MBH and Mbulge has\nbeen predicted by some theories and supported by some\nrecent studies. For example, using a collapse model for\nblack hole and bulge formation, Adams et al. (2001) pre1/4\ndicted MBH /Mbulge \u221d \u03c3, which gives MBH /Mbulge \u221d MBH\nif MBH \u221d \u03c3 4 . This states clearly that the ratio of black\nhole and bulge masses is not constant and can be larger for\ngalaxies with more massive SMBHs. A similar result can\nbe obtained by exploring the model of Wang, Biermann &\nWandel (2000) who derived MBH /Mbulge \u221d \u03c3 1.4 . In addition, recent studies on narrow line Seyfert 1s showed that\ntheir mean MBH /Mbulge ratio is significantly smaller than\nthat for normal Seyfert galaxies (Mathur, Kuraszkiewicz,\n\n\fXue-Bing Wu and J. L. Han: Black hole masses of Seyfert galaxies\n\n& Czerny 2001), which is also consistent with our results because narrow-line Seyfert 1s probably have smaller\nMBH than normal Seyfert galaxies (Boller, Brandt & Fink\n1996).\nFinally we would like to mention that the tight correlation between the black hole mass and bulge luminosity is not surprising and is actually expected from some\nexisting well-known relations. From the MBH -\u03c3 relation\nand Faber-Jackson relation between the bulge luminosity and \u03c3 (Faber & Jackson 1976), we certainly expect\na relation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity. The detailed studies of this relation and the MBH Mbulge relation are necessary because these relations are\nprobably more fundamental than the Faber-Jackson relation and are more closely related to the physics of black\nhole and galaxy formation. We noticed that our result on\nthe MBH -Mbulge relation implies a rather flatter Lbulge -\u03c3\nrelation than the Faber-Jackson relation. This seems to\nbe supported by the finding of Nelson & Whittle (1996).\nHowever, the slope of the Lbulge -\u03c3 relation depends sensitively on the statistical method, sample selection and\nuncertainties of both parameters. In addition, in deriving\nthe MBH /Mbulge ratio, we adopted the same bulge massto-light ratio for Seyfert galaxies as for nearby galaxies\nobtained by Magorrian et al. (1998). Such a ratio may be\nsmaller for Seyfert galaxies (Whittle 1992). Introducing\na smaller bulge mass-to-light ratio may affect our results. We expect that further high quality observations\non Seyfert galaxies, normal galaxies and quasars using\nthe Hubble Space Telescope and larger ground-based telescopes could diminish the uncertainties in measuring the\ngalactic bulge properties and central black hole masses of\nthese objects. These efforts will undoubtedly help us to\nunderstand better the physics of formation and evolution\nof SMBHs and galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.
