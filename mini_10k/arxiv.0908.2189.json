The appearance of singularities in nonlinear cases is known as the blow up of a solution [1, 2]. Singularities\ncan appear in a finite time even for small and smooth initial data [3]. In some cases, both\nlinear and nonlinear, a solution with time either preserves the same regularity as it has on the\nboundary or becomes less or more regular in time. The singularities encountered in the latter\ncase are called anomalous [4, 5]. Criteria for the appearance of anomalous singularities are given\nin [6, 7, 8, 5, 9]. These papers are devoted to the case of interaction between singularities weaker\nthan the Dirac measure. The singularities resulting from this interaction turn out to be weaker\nthan the incoming singularities. A different effect is observed in [11, 12], where the incoming singularities are derivatives of the Dirac measure. In this case the interaction produces singularities\nstronger than the initial ones. We will focus on the phenomenon of improving regularity in the\ncase of initial-boundary value problems with nonlinear local and nonlocal boundary conditions\nfor first-order linear strictly hyperbolic systems.\nSpecifically, in the domain \u03a0 = {(x, t) | 0 < x < 1, t > 0} we address the problem\n(\u2202t + \u039b(x, t)\u2202x + A(x, t))u = g(x, t),\n\u2217\n\n(x, t) \u2208 \u03a0\n\n(1)\n\nInstitute of Mathematics, Humboldt University of Berlin, Rudower Chaussee 25, D-12489 Berlin, Germany\nand Institute for Applied Problems of Mechanics and Mathematics, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Naukova St.\n3b, 79060 Lviv, Ukraine.

Condition (5) occurs in many applications, where the functions uj for j \u2264 k\n(resp. k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) describe the \"species\" that travel to the left (resp. to the right) and are\nreflected in x = 0 (resp. x = 1) according to the boundary conditions (3).\nWe will impose the following smoothness assumptions on the initial data: The entries of \u039b,\nA, g, and h = (h1 , . . . , hn ) are smooth in all their arguments in the respective domains, while\nthe entries of \u03c6 are allowed to be either continuous functions or strongly singular distributions.\nIn the case of a continuous \u03c6 (considered in Section 2), by a solution to problem (1)\u2013(3)\nwe mean a continuous solution, i.e., a continuous vector-function in \u03a0 satisfying an integral\nsystem equivalent to (1)\u2013(3). The existence and uniqueness of a continuous solution is proved\nin [13] (see Theorem 2). In the case of a strongly singular \u03c6 (considered in Section 4) by a\nsolution we mean a delta wave solution, i.e., a weak limit of solutions to the original problem\nwith regularized initial data that does not depend on a particular regularization. We refer the\nreader to [10, 9] for a more detailed definition and motivation of delta waves. Theorem 21 in\nSection 4 establishes the existence of a delta wave solution for a version of (1)\u2013(3).\nIt is clear that the regularity of initial conditions (2) constraints the regularity of a solution\nif the latter is considered in the entire domain \u03a0. However, the influence of the initial data can\nbe suppressed if the regularity behavior is considered in dynamics, starting from a point of time\nT.\nDefinition 1 A solution u to problem (1)\u2013(3)\n\u0001n is called smoothing if, whatever m \u2208 N, there\nm\nexists T > 0 such that u \u2208 C \u03a0 \u2229 {t \u2265 T } .\n\nOur main result is a smoothingness criterion for solutions to problem (1)\u2013(3) in terms of\nthe layout of characteristic curves (Theorems 12 and 22). In the case of classical boundary\ncondition, the criterion implies that the solution is smoothing whenever inf |\u03bbi | > 0 for all i \u2264 n.\nAs another consequence, we obtain a class of boundary conditions under which the wave equation\nhas smoothing solutions (see [14] for a special case of this result).\nOur analysis of problem (1)\u2013(3) shows a phenomenon usually observed in the situations\nwhen solutions to hyperbolic PDEs change their regularity: the smoothness changes jump-like\nrather than gradually. Another feature of problem (1)\u2013(3) shown in [13] is that, even if we\nallow non-Lipschitz nonlinearities in (3), this system demonstrates almost linear behavior. The\n2\n\n\fsmoothingness effect in the non-Lipschitz setting contrasts with blowups [1, 2] observed in many\nnonlinear systems.\nIn [6, 7], results similar to ours are obtained in some more special cases, namely for homogeneous linear boundary conditions of local type with constant coefficients and continuous initial\ndata. Some restrictions on (1)\u2013(3) are imposed in [6, 7] by technical reasons, as the authors\nuse an approach based on the Laplace transformation and the Green's function method. We\nextend these results to the case of general linear first-order hyperbolic systems, nonlinear nonlocal boundary conditions, and distributional initial data of the Dirac delta type and derivatives\nthereof. Note that we use a different approach based on the classical method of characteristics.\nThis method suits well for understanding of the mechanism of the smoothingness effect.\nAn essential technical difficulty to overcome in demonstrating the regularity self-improvement\nis caused by the fact that the domain of influence of initial conditions (2) is in general infinite.\nIn other words, the regularity of solutions all the time depends on the regularity of the initial\ndata. However, this dependence is different for the boundary and the integral parts of the\nequivalent integral form of problem (1)\u2013(3). Since the boundary summands are compositions\nof boundary data with functions defining characteristic curves and hence are \"responsible\" for\npropagation of singularities, the smoothingness effect is encountered whenever the boundary\nsummands have a \"bounded memory\" or, more rigorously, all characteristics of (1) are bounded\nand each boundary singularity expands inside \u03a0 along a finite number of characteristic curves.1\nOur strategy of obtaining the smoothingness criterion consists in identifying an appropriate\nclass of boundary conditions ensuring the \"bounded memory\" property and in showing that the\nintegral summands do eventually improve upon the regularity of the initial data. It is important\nfor our analysis that the lower order terms, with the exception of the diagonal ones, contribute\ninto the integral summands transversely to characteristic directions. This is ensured by (5).\nTherefore, the integral part of the system causes no propagation of singularities and, moreover,\nsuppresses it.\nThe mathematical motivation of the paper is the scope of the stability theory, the Hopf\nbifurcation analysis, and the investigation of small periodic forcing of stationary solutions of\nhyperbolic PDEs. The main reason why those techniques are well established for nonlinear\nODEs and parabolic PDEs, but not for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, is that, in contrast to\nparabolic case, hyperbolic operators in general do not improve the regularity of their solutions\nin time (the question is closely related to propagation of singularities along characteristic curves).\nThis complicates, in particular, proving the Fredholmness property of the linearizations which\nis crucial for the analysis of solutions to nonlinear problems. We provide a range of boundary\nconditions ensuring the desired smoothingness effect, which still makes possible to handle the\nbifurcation analysis of a class of nonlinear problems (this idea goes back to [15]).\nThe practical motivation is caused by applications to mathematical biology [16], chemical\nkinetics (describing mass transition in terms of convective diffusion and chemical reaction and\nanalysis of chemical processes in counterflow chemical reactors [17, 18, 19, 20]), and semiconductor laser dynamics (describing the appearance of self-pulsations of lasers and modulation of\nstationary laser states by time periodic electric pumping [21, 22, 23]).\n1\n\nThis sharply contrasts with the case of a Cauchy problem where solutions cannot be smoothing because the\nboundary part all the time \"remembers\" the regularity of the initial data.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nContinuous initial data\n\nHere we consider the case of continuous initial data \u03c6(x). We will assume the zero-order compatibility conditions between (2) and (3), namely\n\u03c6i (0) = hi (0, v(0)),\n\u03c6i (1) = hi (0, v(0)),\n\nk + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\n\n(6)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nwhere v(0) = \u03c61 (0), . . . , \u03c6k (0), \u03c6k+1 (1), . . . , \u03c6n (1) . By k * k we denote the Euclidian norm in\nRn .\nTheorem 2 ([13, Thm 3.1]) Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , \u03c6i , and hi are continuous functions in all their arguments, and the coefficients \u03bbi are Lipschitz in x \u2208 [0, 1] locally in t \u2208 [0, \u221e).\nSuppose that hi (t, z) are continuously differentiable in z \u2208 Rn and for each T > 0 there exists\nC > 0 such that\nk\u2207z h(t, z)k \u2264 C (log log H(t, kzk))1/4 ,\n(7)\nwhere H is a polynomial in kzk with coefficients in C[0, T ]. If the zero-order compatibility\nconditions (6) are fulfilled, then problem (1)\u2013(3) has a unique continuous solution in \u03a0 which\ncan be found by the sequential approximation method.\nWe now introduce the notions of an Expansion Path and an Influence Path, that will be our\nmain technical tools. Let \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) denote the characteristic of the i-th equation of (1) passing\nthrough (x, t) \u2208 \u03a0. Let \u03c7 be a characteristic of the i-th equation of system (1). Suppose that \u03c7\nreaches \u2202\u03a0 at two points. Let (x, t) be that of these points having larger ordinate (hence, x = 0\nor x = 1). We say that \u03c7 reflects at (x, t) if\n\u2202z hj (t, v1 (t), . . . , vi\u22121 (t), z, vi+1 (t), . . . , vn (t)) 6= 0 for some j \u2264 n and z \u2208 R.\n\n(8)\n\nIn this case that of the characteristics \u03c9j (\u03c4 ; x, t) and \u03c9j (\u03c4 ; 1 \u2212 x, t) which lies above the line\n{\u03c4 = t} is called a reflection of \u03c7. If the reflection is defined by \u03c9j (\u03c4 ; 1 \u2212 x, t), it will be called\na jumping reflection.\nRemark 3 Note that condition (8) means that the i-th components of the vector v(t) participates\nin evaluation of uj (0, t) for k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n and of uj (1, t) for j \u2264 k. Whenever the continuous\nsolution to problem (1)\u2013(3) is known (see Theorem 2), condition (8) is easily checkable. Otherwise, one can use the following constructive sufficient condition: (8) holds true whenever for\nevery (z1 , . . . , zi\u22121 , zi+1 , . . . , zn ) \u2208 Rn\u22121 there is j \u2264 n such that \u2202zi hj (t, z1 , . . . , zn ) 6\u2261 0.\nDefinition 4 A sequence of characteristics \u03c71 , \u03c72 , . . . is called an Extension Path (EP) if each\n\u03c7l+1 is a reflection of \u03c7l (see Figure 1).\nDefinition 5 A sequence of curved segments B1 , . . . , Bs is called an Influence Path (IP) if the\nfollowing conditions are met.\n\u2022 Each Bl is a continuous part of a characteristic \u03c7l of the jl -th equation for some jl \u2264 n;\n4\n\n\ft\n\u03c73\n\u03c72\n\n\u03c71\n\nx\n\n0\n\nFigure 1: An EP.\n\u2022 The whole path is monotone in the sense that the coordinate t continuously increases while\nmoving along it;\n\u2022 The transition from Bl to Bl+1 can be of three types:\n\u2013 Bl and Bl+1 meet at a point (x, t) such that ajl+1jl (x, t) 6\u2261 0 in any neighborhood of\n(x, t);\n\u2013 Bl and Bl+1 meet at a point (x, t) with x = 0 or x = 1 and in any neighborhood of t a\ncharacteristic of the jl -th equation reflects to a characteristic of the jl+1 -th equation;\n\u2013 Bl terminates at a point (x, t) with x = 0 or x = 1, Bl+1 starts at the point (1 \u2212 x, t)\non the opposite side of \u2202\u03a0, and in any neighborhood of t a characteristic of the jl -th\nequation makes a jumping reflection to a characteristic of the jl+1 -th equation.\nRoughly speaking, an IP is a piecewise continuous curve with smooth peaces B1 , . . . , Bs lying on\ncharacteristic curves such that either Bl and Bl+1 meet within \u03a0 or Bl terminates at (x, t) \u2208 \u2202\u03a0\nand Bl+1 starts at the point (1 \u2212 x, t) on the opposite side of \u2202\u03a0.\nRemark 6 Note that any EP is an IP, while the opposite is not necessary true because segments\nof an IP not necessary lie on reflected characteristics.\nDefinition 7 Define a set Xi , called the domain of influence of the initial data on ui , as follows:\n(x, t) \u2208 Xi if the value ui (x, t) can be changed by varying a function \u03c6 in (2).\nSince initial data expand inside \u03a0 along characteristic curves according to boundary conditions\n(3) and the lower order terms of system (1), we have the following characterization.\nLemma 8 (x, t) \u2208 Xi if and only if there is an IP emanating from the initial axis t = 0 and\ngoing through a part of the characteristic \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t).\n\n5\n\n\fThe sufficiency follows from the proof of the necessity in Theorem 12. The proof of the necessity\nis based on the constructive description of the domain of dependence of ui at (x, t) which turns\nout to be the union of the IPs going through a part of \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) below the line \u03c4 = t. Under\nthe domain of dependence of ui at (x0 , t0 ) we mean the set of all points (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a0 such that if\nvarying the function\nu(x, t\u2032 ) = \u03c8(x)\n(9)\nin any sufficiently small neighborhood of x\u2032 , the i-th component of the solution to problem (1),\n(9), (3) changes at (x0 , t0 ).\nDefinition 9 Define a set Xi\u25e6 to be the union of IPs emanating from the initial axis t = 0 and\nsatisfying Definition 5 with additional conditions imposed on the three transition types from Bl\nto Bl+1 :\n\u2013 Bl and Bl+1 meet at a point (x, t) such that ajl+1 jl (x, t) 6= 0;\n\u2013 Bl and Bl+1 meet at a point (x, t) with x = 0 or x = 1 and at this point \u03c7l reflects to\n\u03c7l+1 ;\n\u2013 Bl terminates at a point (x, t) with x = 0 or x = 1, Bl+1 starts at the point (1 \u2212 x, t) on\nthe opposite side of \u2202\u03a0, and at (x, t) the characteristic \u03c7l makes a jumping reflection to\n\u03c7l+1 .\nNote that Xi\u25e6 = Xi .\nWe now introduce two conditions that will occur in formulation of our results.\n(\u03b9) For every T > 0 there exists T \u2032 > T such that, for all x \u2208 [0, 1], every EP passing through\n(x, T ) lies below the line t = T \u2032 .\n(\u03b9\u03b9) For every T > 0 and i \u2264 n there exists T \u2032 > T such that, for all x \u2208 [0, 1] with\n(x, T ) \u2208 Xi\u25e6 , every EP containing the characteristic \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, T ) lies below the line t = T \u2032 .\nRemark 10 In many important cases conditions (\u03b9) and (\u03b9\u03b9) can easily be reformulated and\nverified in terms of \u03bb, A, and h. Sometimes they can be verified even directly (see examples in\nSection 3).\nSet \u03a0T = {(x, t) | 0 < x < 1, 0 < t < T }.\nRemark 11 Let T > 0. In the domain \u03a0 \\ \u03a0T let us consider problem (1), (9), (3) with aij \u2261 0\nfor all i 6= j (i.e., system (1) is decoupled) and with t\u2032 replaced by T in (9). Then condition (\u03b9)\nmeans that, whatever T > 0 and \u03c8(x), the function \u03c8(x) has a bounded domain of influence on\nui for every i \u2264 n. In other words, for any decoupled system (1), if \u03c8(x) is singular at some point\nx \u2208 [0, 1], then this singularity expands outside \u03a0T along a finite number of characteristic curves\nwithin \u03a0T \u2032 for some T \u2032 > T that does not depend on x \u2208 [0, 1]. In contrast to (\u03b9), condition\n(\u03b9\u03b9) means that, whatever T > 0 and \u03c8i (x), the function \u03c8i (x) restricted to Xi\u25e6 \u2229 {t = T } has a\nbounded domain of influence on ui for every i \u2264 n.\nTheorem 12 Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , and hi are smooth functions in all their arguments and conditions (5) and (7) are fulfilled.\n6\n\n\f\u2022 Sufficiency. Assume that condition (\u03b9) is fulfilled. Then the continuous solution to problem\n(1)\u2013(3) is smoothing for any \u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n satisfying equalities (6).\n\u2022 Necessity. Assume that the continuous solution to problem (1)\u2013(3) is smoothing for any\n\u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n satisfying equalities (6). Then condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is fulfilled.\nRemark 13 One can easily see that the sufficient condition (\u03b9) implies the necessary condition\n(\u03b9\u03b9), while the converse is not true. Nevertheless, in a quite general situation when Xi\u25e6 = \u03a0 for\nevery i \u2264 n, it is not difficult to observe that conditions (\u03b9) and (\u03b9\u03b9) are equivalent. Hence we\nhave the following result.\nCorollary 14 Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , and hi are smooth functions in all their arguments, Xi\u25e6 = \u03a0 for every i \u2264 n, and conditions (5) and (7) are fulfilled. Then the continuous\nsolution to problem (1)\u2013(3) is smoothing for any \u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n if and only if condition (\u03b9) is\nfulfilled.\nProof. Sufficiency. Assume that condition (\u03b9) is fulfilled. Define a sequence T1 , T2 , . . .\ninductively by the following rule. Let T1 be the infimum of those \u03c4 > 0 for which there is x and\nan EP passing through (x, 0) and lying below the line t = \u03c4 ; let Tj for j > 1 be the infimum\nof those \u03c4 > 0 for which there is x and an EP passing through (x, Tj\u22121 ) and lying below the\nline t = Tj\u22121 . Note that Tj is monotone and approaches the infinity. The latter fact is a simple\nconsequence of the smoothness assumptions on \u039b. By Theorem 2, problem\n(1)\u2013(3) has a unique\n\u0001n\ncontinuous solution u in \u03a0. It suffices to show that u \u2208 C j \u03a0 \\ \u03a0Tj .\nConsider problem (1)\u2013(3) first in \u03a0 \\ \u03a0T1 .

In the sequel, along with the equation\n\u03be = \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) we will also use its inverse form \u03c4 = \u03c9\u0303i (\u03be; x, t). Due to the definition of T1 , in the\nboundary term hi (ti (x, t), v(ti (x, t))) in (10) we can substitute\nvj (ti (x, t)) = Ej (tj (xj , ti (x, t)); xj , ti (x, t))hj (tj (xj , ti (x, t)), v(tj (xj , ti (x, t))))\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ntiZ(x,t)\nX\nEj (\u03c4 ; xj , ti (x, t)) \uf8f0\u2212\n+\najs (\u03be, \u03c4 )us (\u03be, \u03c4 ) + gj (\u03be, \u03c4 )\uf8fb\ntj (xj ,ti (x,t))\n\n(11)\nd\u03c4,\n\n\u03be=\u03c9j (\u03c4 ;xj ,ti (x,t))\n\ns6=j\n\nwhere xj = 0 if 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k and xj = 1 if k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Continuing in this fashion, the right-hand\nside of (10) can eventually be brought into a form depending neither on v nor on\u0001\u03c6. This version\nof (10) will be referred to as (10\u2032 ). We begin with establishing the Cx1 \u03a0 \\ \u03a0T1 -smoothness of\nu.

Analogously to (14), the\ndefinition of Tk makes possible an integral representation of the system for \u2202xk u which does not\ndepend on v (k) and includes integrals of \u2202xk\u22121 u similar to Iijs (x, t). To show the Cxk -smoothness\nof the solution, we transform the integral terms analogously to (13). Finally, the C k -smoothness\nof u outside of \u03a0Tk follows from suitable differentiations of system (1). The sufficiency is thereby\nproved.\nNecessity. Suppose that condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is not fulfilled and prove that the solution to problem\n(1)\u2013(3) is not smoothing for some \u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n . Fix T = t0 > 0 and i \u2264 n such that for all\nT \u2032 > t0 there is an EP containing the characteristic \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t0 ) for some (x, t0 ) \u2208 Xi and going\nbeyond \u03a0T \u2032 .\nSince all singularities of solutions expand along EPs, it is sufficient to prove that there exist\nm \u2208 N and \u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n such that, whatever (x0 , t0 ) \u2208 Xi\u25e6 , the solution u is not C m -smooth at\n(x0 , t0 ).\nBy Lemma 8, for any (x, t0 ) \u2208 Xi there is an Influence Path B1 , . . . , Bs emanating from the\nline t = 0 and going through a part of \u03c9i (t; x, t0 ). Denote the smallest possible \"length\" of such\na path by s(x). By the smoothness assumptions on the initial data, if x\u2032 is sufficiently close to\nx and (x\u2032 , t0 ) \u2208 Xi , then s(x\u2032 ) \u2264 s(x). Since Xi \u2229 {t = t0 } is closed, the standard compactness\nargument implies that s(x) is bounded by a constant s0 uniformly over all x.\nLet \u03c6 be a continuous nowhere differentiable function. Consider an arbitrary (x0 , t0 ) \u2208 Xi\u25e6 .\nLet us fix a shortest Influence Path B1 , . . . , Bs from some (z0 , 0) to (x0 , t0 ) with Bs lying on\n10\n\n\ft\n\n(x 0 ,t 0 )\n\n(z2 ,T2 )\nT2 \u2212 \u03b5\n\n\u03c9j (t;z2 ,T2 )\n\n\u03c9 i (t;x 0 ,t0 )\n\n2\n\nT1 + \u03b5\nS\n\n(z1 ,T1 )\n\n\u03c9j (t;z1 ,T1 )\n1\n\n0\n\nx\n\nz0\n\nFigure 3: The set B\u0303.\n\u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x0 , t0 ) and with the transition from Bl to Bl+1 as in Definition 9. Using the smoothness\nassumptions on A and h, we can suppose that 0 < z0 < 1. We now intend to prove that\nthe solution u is not C s -smooth at (x0 , t0 ). Since s \u2264 s0 , this will give us the necessary part\nof the theorem. Let (zl , Tl ) denote the starting point of Bl+1 . Suppose that Bl is a part of\na characteristic \u03c7l of the jl -th equation. As \u03c6j1 is not continuously differentiable at z0 , the\nfunction uj1 is not C 1 -smooth along \u03c71 due to the definition of a characteristic. If \u03c72 is a\nreflection of \u03c71 , then uj2 is not differentiable at (z1 , T1 ) and hence uj2 is not differentiable along\n\u03c72 . Otherwise, by Definition 5, we have aj2 j1 (z1 , T1 ) 6= 0 and uj2 is not C 2 -smooth along \u03c72 ,\nbecause the integral of aj2 j1 uj1 along \u03c72 in the integral form of the j2 -th differential equation is\nnot a C 2 -function and this nonsmoothness cannot be compensated by any other summands in\nthe integral representation of our problem. It follows that uj2 is not C 2 -smooth, in particular,\nat (z2 , T2 ). Continuing in this way, we arrive at the conclusion that ui is not C s -smooth along\n\u03c9i (t; x0 , t0 ) and hence u is not C s -smooth at (x0 , t0 ).\nGoing into the details of the above argument, let us represent ui (x0 , t0 ) in an integral form\nwith an integration over a neighborhood of the Influence Path B1 , . . . , Bs . We focus on the\ncase of s = 3 where characteristic \u03c73 is not a reflection of \u03c72 and \u03c72 is not a reflection of\n\u03c71 (see Fig. 3). A similar or even simpler argument works as well for other possible cases.\nExtend each Bl to Bl\u2032 = \u03c7l \u2229 \u03a0Tl . Given \u03b5 > 0, let B denote the union of Bs\u2032 and one-sided\n\u2032\nneighborhoods of B1\u2032 , . . . , Bs\u22121\n, bounded by the characteristics \u03c9j2 (\u03c4 ; \u03c9i (T2 \u2212 \u03b5; x0 , t0 ), T2 \u2212 \u03b5)\nand \u03c9j1 (\u03c4 ; \u03c9j2 (T1 + \u03b5; \u03c9i (T2 \u2212 \u03b5; x0 , t0 ), T2 \u2212 \u03b5), T1 + \u03b5). Fix an \u03b5 > 0 so that B contains neither\n(0, 0) nor (1, 0).\nNow we write an integral representation of ui (x0 , t0 ) in terms of u over B. We start from\nthe formula (10) for ui (x0 , t0 ) and rewrite a part of the integral in the right-hand side as\n\n11\n\n\fZT2\n\nEi (\u03c4 ; x0 , t0 )aij2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )uj2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\nT2 \u2212\u03b5\n\n=\n\nZT2\n\nT2 \u2212\u03b5\n\n\u0014\nEi (\u03c4 ; x0 , t0 )aij2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) Ej2 (tj2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ); \u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )hj2 (tj2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ), v(tj2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )))\n\nZ\u03c4\n\n+\n\ntj2 (\u03be(\u03c4 ),\u03c4 )\n\n\u0014X\nEj2 (\u03c41 ; \u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )\naj2 s (\u03c9j2 (\u03c41 ; \u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ), \u03c41 )us (\u03c9j2 (\u03c41 ; \u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ), \u03c41 )\ns6=j2\n\n\u0015\n\u0015\n+gj2 (\u03c9j2 (\u03c41 ; \u03be(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ), \u03c41 ) d\u03c41 d\u03c4.\n\n(16)\n\nBy construction, aij2 (z2 , T2 ) 6= 0.

Note that \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c1, \u03c3, and \u03b6 are (at least) continuous functions, what easily\nfollows from the smoothness assumptions imposed on the initial data. It follows that ui is not\nC 3 -smooth at (x0 , t0 ) (even if \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c1, \u03c3, and \u03b6 are C \u221e -functions).\nThe necessity is proved.\n\u0003\n\n3\n\nExamples\n\nHere we give some examples to show how the criterion given by Theorem 12 works. Each of these\nexamples is rather general and interesting by its own. Throughout this section it is supposed\nthat all characteristics of system (1) are bounded. This assumption is not restrictive from the\npractical point of view. It is true, for example, whenever inf |\u03bbi | > 0 for all i \u2264 n.\n\n3.1\n\nClassical boundary conditions\n\nAs a partial case of problem (1)\u2013(3), consider (1), (2) with classical boundary conditions\nui (0, t) = hi (t), k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, t \u2208 (0, \u221e)\nui (1, t) = hi (t), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\nt \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n\n(19)\n\nTheorem 15 Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , and hi are smooth in all their arguments. Suppose that condition (5) is fulfilled. Then the continuous solution to problem (1), (2), (19) is\nsmoothing for any \u03c6 \u2208 C[0, 1]n satisfying (6).\nThis result is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 12. Indeed, since no reflection from\nthe boundary is possible, every EP passing through (x, t) consists of a single characteristic.\nMoreover, due to the smoothness assumptions on \u039b and the definition of a characteristic, for\nany T > 0 there is T \u2032 > T such that all characteristics passing through the line t = T lei below\nt = T \u2032 . Hence the sufficient condition (\u03b9) is fulfilled and the theorem follows.\nRemark 16 Even in the case of smooth classical boundary conditions (19), the domain of influence of the initial data on ui for every i \u2264 n in general is unbounded (due to the lower order\nterms in (1)). In spite of this, the influence of the initial data on the regularity of u becomes\nweaker and weaker in time causing the smoothingness effect.\n\n3.2\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions\n\nSuppose that at least one component of the solution, say the first one, satisfies periodic boundary\ncondition. Specifically, the first equation in (3) is written in the form u1 (0, t) = u1 (1, t). Then the\ndomain of influence of initial data (2) on u1 is the whole \u03a0. Moreover, for each (x, t) \u2208 \u03a0, there\nis an unbounded EP passing through (x, t) (at least one constructed by means of characteristics\nof the first equation). This entails that the necessary condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is not fulfilled and hence the\nsolution to problem (1)\u2013(3) is not smoothing.\n\n14\n\n\f3.3\n\nNonseparable linear boundary conditions of local type\n\nConsider now the reflection boundary conditions\nui (0, t) =\nui (1, t) =\n\nk\nX\n\nbij uj (0, t),\n\nj=1\nn\nX\n\nk + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, t \u2208 (0, \u221e)\n(20)\n\ncij uj (1, t), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\n\nt \u2208 (0, \u221e),\n\nj=k+1\n\nwhere bij and cij are constants. Systems like (1), (2), (20) cover linearizations of many mathematical models for chemical kinetics [19, 20].\nOur aim is to reformulate sufficient condition (\u03b9) constructively in terms of data (specifically,\nin terms of boundary data) of our problem. Note first that, if bij 6= 0 for some k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\nand j \u2264 k (resp., cij 6= 0 for some i \u2264 k and k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n), then each characteristic of the\nj-th equation reflects from the boundary x = 0 (resp., from the boundary x = 1), the reflections\nbeing characteristics of the i-th equation. Since all EPs passing through (x, t) are constructed\nby means of subsequent reflections, for each EP passing through (x, t) and consisting of more\nthan one smooth piece, there is a unique sequence (finite if the EP passing through (x, t) is\nbounded and infinite otherwise) either of kind\nbi2 i1 , ci3 i2 , bi4 i3 , ci5 i4 , . . .\n\n(21)\n\nci2 i1 , bi3 i2 , ci4 i3 , bi5 i4 , . . .\n\n(22)\n\nor of kind\nwith nonzero elements. Condition (\u03b9) is satisfied iff for every T > 0 all EPs passing through\n(x, T ) are bounded uniformly in x \u2208 [0, 1]. The latter is equivalent to the statement that all\nthe sequences (21) and (22) are finite. This means that condition (\u03b9) is expressible here in the\nalgebraic form, namely as a finite number of equalities of kind\nbi2 i1 * ci3 i2 * bi4 i3 * ci5 i4 * * * * * bin\u22121 in\u22122 * cin in\u22121 = 0\n\n(23)\n\nfor all possible i1 , . . . , in such that the entries of matrices Bn\u2212k,k = {bij }k+1\u2264i\u2264n,j\u2264n and\nCk,n\u2212k = {cij }i\u2264k,k+1\u2264j\u2264n appear in (23) no more than once.\nCondition (23) can be easily reformulated in the following form (see also [7]). Set\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIn\u2212k Bn\u2212k,k\nR =\n,\nCk,n\u2212k\nIk\nwhere Ij is a unit matrix of size j. Consider an expansion of the determinant of R along the\nfirst n \u2212 k rows, namely,\nX\ndet R =\nDi1 ,...,in\u2212k Fi1 ,...,in\u2212k .\n(24)\ni1 <***<in\u2212k\n\nHere the respective determinants of order n \u2212 k are denoted by Di1 ,...,in\u2212k and their cofactors by\nFi1 ,...,in\u2212k . It turns out that each summand in (24) starting from the second one is a product of\nkind (23). One can easily show that (23) is fulfilled iff all summands in (24) excepting for the\nfirst one, which is obviously equals to 1, vanish. Note that the latter condition is obtained in [7]\nfor problem (1), (2), (20) with coefficients in (1) depending only on x.\n15\n\n\f3.4\n\nSmoothingness phenomenon for IBVPs for the wave equation\n\nUsing Theorems 2 and 12, one can immediately obtain correctly posed IBVPs for the (nonhomogeneous) wave equation\n(\u2202t2 \u2212 a2 \u2202x2 )u = f (x, t)\n(25)\nand state a smoothingness result for them.

Assume that the continuous solution to problem (25)\u2013(27) is smoothing for any\n\u03c6 \u2208 C 1 [0, 1] and \u03c8 \u2208 C[0, 1] satisfying the zero-order compatibility conditions between (29)\nand (30). Then condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is fulfilled.\n\n4\n\nDistributional initial data\n\nNow we address the case of distributional initial data. Specifically, we investigate system (1)\nwith initial conditions\nui (x, 0) = bi (x) \u2261 bir (x) + bis (x) = bir (x) +\n\nmi\nX\nj=1\n\ni \u2264 n, 0 <\n\nx\u2217i1\n\n< *** <\n\nx\u2217imi\n\n< 1,\n16\n\nx \u2208 (0, 1)\n\ncij \u03b4(lij ) (x \u2212 x\u2217ij ),\n\n(31)\n\n\fand boundary conditions\nui (0, t) =\n\nn\nX\n\npij (t)vju (t) + ri (t, v u (t)), k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, t \u2208 (0, \u221e)\n\nj=1\n\nui (1, t) =\n\nn\nX\n\n(32)\npij (t)vju (t) + ri (t, v u (t)),\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\n\nt \u2208 (0, \u221e),\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the regular part br (x) = (b1r , . . . , bnr ) of the initial data b(x) = (b1 , . . . , bn ) is a continuous vector-function on [0, 1], ri (t, y) \u2208 C \u221e ([0, \u221e) \u00d7 Rn ), ri and \u2207y ri are bounded in y \u2208 Rn\nuniformly in t over any compact subset of R+ , and pij (t) \u2208 C \u221e [0, \u221e). Also, cij \u2208 R, mi \u2208 N,\nand lij \u2208 N0 . Furthermore, v u (t) just redenotes the vector-function v(t) introduced in Section 1\nby (4). We will use such notation below with other superscripts. Without restriction of generality we can suppose that the zero-order compatibility conditions between (31) and (32) are\nfulfilled, namely,\nbri (0) =\n\nn\nX\n\npij (0)vju (0) + ri (0, v u (0)),\n\nj=1\nn\nX\n\nbri (1) =\n\nk+1\u2264i\u2264n\n(33)\n\npij (0)vju (0)\n\nu\n\n+ ri (0, v (0)),\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k,\n\nj=1\n\nwhere v u (0) = (br1 (0), . . . , brk (0), br,k+1 (1), . . . , brn (1)).\nNote that system (1), (31), (32) is unsolvable in the classical sense, since nonlinearities in the\nboundary conditions and singularities in the initial data entail nonlinear operations in the space\nof distributions. We, therefore, aim at constructing a delta wave solution to (1), (31), (32). For\nthis purpose we regularize the singular part bs (x) of initial data (31)\nby means of the convolution\nR\nwithRthe so-called model delta nets (\u03c6\u03b5 )\u03b5>0 where \u03c6 \u2208 D(R), \u03c6 dx = 1, \u03c6\u03b5 (x) = 1/\u03b5\u03c6(x/\u03b5),\nand |\u03c6\u03b5 | dx is bounded by a constant independent of \u03b5. The regularized problem for u\u03b5 is this:\n(\u2202t + \u039b\u2202x + A)u\u03b5 = g(x, t)\nu\u03b5i (x, 0)\n\n= bir (x) +\n\nu\u03b5i (0, t) =\n\nn\nX\n\nb\u03b5is (x)\n\n= bir (x) +\n\nmi\nX\n\n(l )\n\ncij \u03c6\u03b5 ij (x \u2212 x\u2217ij ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\n\nj=1\n\npij (t)vju,\u03b5 (t) + ri (t, v u,\u03b5 (t)),\n\nk+1\u2264i\u2264n\n\npij (t)vju,\u03b5 (t) + ri (t, v u,\u03b5 (t)),\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\n(34)\n\nj=1\n\nu\u03b5i (1, t) =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nHere v u,\u03b5 (t) = (u\u03b51 (0, t), . . . , u\u03b5k (0, t), u\u03b5k+1 (1, t), . . . , u\u03b5n (1, t)). Decompose A = D + F into the\ndiagonal and off-diagonal parts D and F , respectively.

System (35) is linear, corresponds to the singular\npart of the initial problem, and is responsible for propagation of singularities. System (36) is\nnonlinear and corresponds to the regular part of our problem. Note that, since F is the offdiagonal part of A, the singular forcing term F z contributes into the hyperbolic system (36)\ntransversely to the characteristic directions and, therefore, cannot produce strong singularities\nfor w. We now show that problems (35) and (36) are uniquely solvable.\nDefinition 18 By J\u2217 we denote the union, over i \u2264 n and j \u2264 mi , of all EPs containing the\ncharacteristic \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x\u2217ij , 0). Furthermore, J will denote the union, over i \u2264 n and j \u2264 mi , of all\nEPs emanating from the point (x\u2217ij , 0).\nNote that J\u2217 \u2282 J.\nLemma 19 System (35) has a unique distributional solution z representable as the sum of\nsingular distributions concentrated on characteristic curves in the set J\u2217 .\nThe lemma can \u0001be easily proved by the method of characteristics.\nLet C \u03a0 \\ J be the space of piecewise continuous functions on \u03a0 with (possibly) first-order\ndiscontinuities on J.\n\u0001n\nLemma 20 System (36) has a unique C \u03a0 \\ J -solution w.\nProof. The\u0001 uniqueness can be easily proved by considering the problem for the difference\nn\nof two C \u03a0 \\ J -solutions to (36) and applying the method of characteristics.\n\n18\n\n\fTo prove existence, consider w = w\u0304 + w\u0303, where w\u0304 is the solution to the linear system with\nthe strongly singular forcing term\n(\u2202t + \u039b\u2202x + D)w\u0304 + F z = g(x, t)\nw\u0304(x, 0) = br (x)\nn\nX\npij (t)vjw\u0304 (t), k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\nw\u0304i (0, t) =\nw\u0304i (1, t) =\n\nj=1\nn\nX\n\n(37)\n\npij (t)vjw\u0304 (t), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k\n\nj=1\n\nand w\u0303 is the solution to the nonlinear system\n(\u2202t + \u039b\u2202x + A)w\u0303 + F w\u0304 = 0\nw\u0303(x, 0) = 0\nn\nX\npij (t)vjw\u0303 (t) + ri (t, v w\u0304 + v w\u0303 ), k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\nw\u0303i (0, t) =\nw\u0303i (1, t) =\n\nj=1\nn\nX\n\n(38)\n\npij (t)vjw\u0303 (t) + ri (t, v w\u0304 + v w\u0303 ), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\nj=1\n\nNote that, if w\u0304 is a solution to (37) and w\u0303 is a solution to (38), then w\u0304 + w\u0303 is a solution to (36)\nindeed.\n\u0001n\nTo show that system (37) has a (unique) solution w\u0304 \u2208 C \u03a0 \\ J , we use the method of\ncharacteristics again, thereby representing w\u0304 explicitly in the integral form. Since the singularities in the forcing term F z are strong and transverse to the corresponding characteristics of the\nhyperbolic system, the Volterra integrals of F z in the integral representation of w are at worst\ndiscontinuous functions with the first order discontinuities (if any) on\u0001J.\nn\nTo show that problem (38) has a (unique) solution w\u0303 \u2208 C \u03a0 \\ J , we follow the proof of\nTheorem [13, Thm 2.1] with minor changes. Fix an arbitrary T > 0 and rewrite (38) in \u03a0T in an\nequivalent integral form with the boundary term not depending on v w\u0303 (applying a finite number\nof integrations along characteristic curves up to reaching the initial axis). Using the assumption\nthat \u2207y ri (t, y) is bounded locally in t \u2208 R+ and globally in y \u2208 Rn , it is not difficult to check\n\u0001n\nthat the operator defined by the right-hand side of the integral form of (38) maps C \u03a0 \\ J\ninto itself and is contractible on \u03a0\u03b80 for some \u03b80 \u2264 T . The local existence-uniqueness result in\n\u03a0\u03b80 then follows from the Banach fixed point theorem. If \u03b80 < T , we consider problem (38)\non \u03a0T \\ \u03a0\u03b80 with the initial condition replaced by u(x, \u03b80 ) = \u03c8(x) \u2208 C ([0, 1] \\ J)n , where the\nfunction \u03c8(x) is determined in the first step. Similarly to the above, the\u0001right-hand\nside of the\n\u0001n\n\u03b8\n0\nintegral form of this problem defines the operator mapping C \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 \\ J into itself. Set\n\u03a00 = \u2205. Since the contraction property of the operator under consideration does not depend on\nthe initial conditions, one can choose the value of \u03b80 from the very beginning so small that the\noperator is contractible on \u03a0(s+1)\u03b80 \\ \u03a0s\u03b80 for any 0 \u2264 s \u2264 \u2308T /\u03b80 \u2309 \u2212 1. Applying the Banach\n\u03b80\n2\u03b80\nfixed point \u0010\u0010\ntheorem with\u0011respect\n\u0011 to the domain \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 , we conclude that problem (38) has\na unique C\n\n2\u03b80\n\n\u03a0\n\n\\ \u03a0\u03b80 \\ J\n\nn\n\n-solution.

Since T > 0 is arbitrary, the\nn\nunique solvability of (38) in C \u03a0 \\ J follows.\n\u0001n\nWe have thus proved that (36) has a unique solution w in C \u03a0 \\ J , which equals to\nw\u0304 + w\u0303.\n\u0003\nWe are now prepared to state our result about delta waves.\nTheorem 21 Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , pij , ri , and bir are continuous functions in all\ntheir arguments, \u03bbi are Lipschitz in x \u2208 [0, 1] locally in t \u2208 [0, \u221e), and both ri and \u2207y ri are in\nL\u221e ((0, T ) \u00d7 Rn ) for any T > 0.

We will use a modification of (41) where the boundary term (Ri \u03b1\u03b5 )(x, t) does not\ndepend on v \u03b1,\u03b5 . More specifically, using (41), we express vj\u03b1,\u03b5 (ti (x, t)) contributing into (42)\nin an integral form. If the resulting expression for \u03b1\u03b5 (x, t) still depends on v \u03b1,\u03b5 , we apply\nthe same procedure again. In a finite number of steps we reach the initial axis and thereby\n\u03b5 , L\u03b5 ,\nobtain the desired representation for \u03b1\u03b5j (x, t). It is the sum of a continuous function (of Kij\ni\nand pij ) and a finite number of integrals over characteristic curves in the EPs passing through\n\u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) and restricted to \u03a0t . Let N be the maximal number of such integrals where the range\nof maximization is i \u2264 n and (x, t) \u2208 \u03a0T .

Note that, due to the support\nproperties of z \u03b5 , we have v w+z,\u03b5(t) \u2261 v w,\u03b5 (t) and hence L\u03b5i (t) \u2261 0 on \u2202\u03a0 \\ (N \u03b5 \u222a {t = 0}). As\nN \u03b51 \u2282 N \u03b52 for all \u03b51 < \u03b52 , we have the identity L\u03b5i (t) \u2261 0 on \u2202\u03a0\\(N \u03b50 \u222a{t = 0}) for an arbitrarily\nfixed \u03b50 > 0 and all \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 .

Note that ti (x, t) \u2208 \u2202\u03a0 \\ N \u03b50 ;\nhence vj\u03b1,\u03b5 (ti (x, t)) is expressible in the form (41) again with L\u03b5j = 0. Continuing in this way,\nsimilarly to the above we arrive at the integral representation of \u03b1\u03b5 where the boundary term\ndepends neither on L\u03b5 nor on v \u03b1,\u03b5 . Roughly speaking, each \u03b1\u03b5i (x, t) is a finite sum of integrals\n(of kind as in (41)) over characteristics in the EPs passing through \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) and restricted to\n\n21\n\n\f\u03a0t . We split each of the integrals into two parts, the splitting procedure being illustrated by\nexample of the integral in (41):\nZt\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 =\n\nti (x,t)\n\nd\u03c4 +\n\n[ti (x,t),t]\\\u25b3\u03b50 (x,t)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4,\n\n\u25b3\u03b50 (x,t)\nT\n\nwhere \u25b3\u03b50 (x, t) = {\u03c4 \u2208 [ti (x, t), t] : (\u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t), \u03c4 ) \u2208 J\u2217\u03b50 }. Since \u03b1\u03b5 is bounded on \u03a0 uniformly\nin \u03b5 > 0, there is C > 0 (depending on T ) such that the absolute value of the second integral is\nbounded from above by C\u03b50 .

The desired\nconvergence is thereby proved. The first statement of the theorem now follows by dominated\nconvergence.\n2. This part easily follows from diagonality of matrix D by the method of characteristics.\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n3. Given \u03b5, denote\n\u0001n by w\u0304 the continuous solution to (37) with z in place of z and let w\u0304\ndenote the C \u03a0 \\ J -solution to (37).

It\nremains to prove that {w\u0304\u03b5 }\u03b5>0 converges in C (K). Note first that the solution to problem (37)\nis the sum of the solution to the version of (37) with br (x) \u2261 0 and g(x, t) \u2261 0 and the solution\nto the version of (37) with F (x, t) \u2261 0. Since the solution to the latter problem is continuous in\n\u03a0, our task reduces to proving the convergence of {w\u0304\u03b5 }\u03b5>0 in C (K) in the case when br (x) \u2261 0\nand g(x, t) \u2261 0.\nLet J \u03b5 be the union, over i \u2264 n, j \u2264 mi , and \u03b1 \u2208 [\u2212\u03b5; \u03b5], of all EPs emanating from\n\u2217\n(xij + \u03b1, 0). Fix an arbitrary i \u2264 n and \u03b50 > 0 such that K \u2282 \u03a0 \\ J \u03b50 . It is easily seen that,\ngiven (x, t) \u2208 K, w\u0304i\u03b5 (x, t) for each \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 is a finite sum of integrals over the characteristics\n22\n\n\f\u03be\n\u03c9 i (\u03c4 ;x,t)\n(x,t)\n\n\u03b5\n\nC 1 (x,t)\n\n\u03b5\n\nC 2 (x,t)\n\n\u03b5\n\nC 4 (x,t)\n\n\u03b5\nC 3 (x,t)\n\n\u03b5\n\nC 5 (x,t)\n0\n\n\u03c4\n\nx*sj\n\nFigure 4: Construction of the set J\u2217\u03b5 .\nin the EPs passing through \u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t) and restricted to \u03a0t \u2229 J \u03b5 (see Fig. 4). Denote these by\nC1\u03b5 , . . . , Cl\u03b5 . Moreover, suppose that Cj\u03b5 is given by equation x = cj (t).\nLet fq,s denote the entries of the matrix F . Moreover, q(j) is the index of the characteristic\ncurve passing through Cj\u03b5 and s(j) is the index of the characteristic curves bounding the \"tube\"\ncontaining Cj\u03b5 . An explicit calculation of w\u0304i\u03b5 (x, t) gives us equality\n\u03b5+\n\nw\u0304i\u03b5 (x, t) =\n\nl\nX\n\nPij (x, t)\n\nj=1\n\nZtj\n\n\u03b5+\n\u03b5\nEq(j) (\u03c4 ; cj (t\u03b5+\nj ), tj )fq(j),s(j) (cj (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 )zs(j) (cj (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 ) d\u03c4,\n\n(45)\n\nt\u03b5\u2212\nj\n\n\u03b5+\n\u03b5\nwhere [t\u03b5\u2212\nj , tj ] is the projection of Cj onto t-axis and Pij (x, t) is a smooth function of pij .\nFurthermore, for any j \u2264 l there are \u03b1(j) \u2264 n, \u03b2(j) \u2264 m\u03b1 , i1 , . . . , i\u03b3 \u2208 N, and smooth\nmappings Ti1 : t \u2212\u2192 ti1 (cj (t), t), Tip : t \u2212\u2192 tip (xip , t) for 1 < p < \u03b3, and Ti\u03b3 : t \u2212\u2192\n\u03c9i\u03b3 (0; xi\u03b3 , t), where xi = 0 for i \u2264 k and xi = 1 for k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Geometrically speaking, for\neach j \u2264 l there is x\u2217\u03b1(j),\u03b2(j) and a continuous path in J\u2217\u03b5 containing both the curve Cj\u03b5 and the\npoint (x\u2217\u03b1(j),\u03b2(j) , 0), whatsoever \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b50 . Moreover, the value of \u03b3 equals to the number of the\n\"tubes\" creating this path.\nNote that l as a function of (x, t) is constant on any connected component of \u03a0 \\ J \u03b50 . From\n\u03b5\nnow on by l we will denote the value of this function on K. Calculating of zs(j)\nand changing\n\u03b5\nvariables by means of Tip , we transform expression (45) for w\u0304i (x, t) on K to a form more\nconvenient for our purpose, namely,\n\nw\u0304i\u03b5 (x, t)\n\n=\n\nl\nX\n\nx\u2217\u03b1(j),\u03b2(j) +\u03b5\n\nZ\n\n(l\n\n)\n\nQij (\u03be; x, t)\u03c6\u03b5 \u03b1(j),\u03b2(j) (\u03be \u2212 x\u2217\u03b1(j),\u03b2(j) ) d\u03be,\n\nj=1x\u2217\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u03b1(j),\u03b2(j)\n\n23\n\n(46)\n\n\fwhere the kernels Qij (\u03be; x, t) are certain smooth functions.

On the account of Claim 1, it is sufficient to prove that w\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0303 \u2192 0 as\n\u03b5 \u2192 0 in C(K). The difference w\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0303 is a solution to the following problem:\n(\u2202t + \u039b\u2202x + A) (w\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0303) = \u2212F (w\u0304\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304)\n(w\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0303) (x, 0) = 0\nn\nX\n\u0001\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\u0001\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\npij (t)vjw \u2212w\u0304 \u2212w\u0303 (0, t) + ri t, v w \u2212 ri t, v w\u0304+w\u0303 ,\n(wi \u2212 w\u0304i \u2212 w\u0303i ) (0, t) =\nj=1\n\n(wi\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304i\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0303i ) (1, t) =\n\nn\nX\n\nk+1\u2264i\u2264n\n\npij (t)vjw\n\n\u03b5 \u2212w\u0304 \u03b5 \u2212w\u0303\n\n(0, t) + ri t, v w\n\nj=1\n\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u0001\n\n(47)\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 ri t, v w\u0304+w\u0303 ,\n\nRewrite\n\u03b5\n\nri (t, v w ) \u2212 ri (t, v w\u0304+w\u0303 )\nZ1\n\u0001\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n= (\u2207y ri ) (t, \u03c3v w + (1 \u2212 \u03c3)v w\u0304 +w\u0303 ) d\u03c3 * v w \u2212w\u0304 \u2212w\u0303 + ri (t, v w\u0304 +w\u0303 ) \u2212 ri (t, v w\u0304+w\u0303 ) .\n0\n\nSimilarly to (39), consider an integral form of (47) on K with the boundary term not depending\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\non v w \u2212w\u0304 \u2212w\u0303 . Since w\u0304\u03b5 \u2192 w\u0304 as \u03b5 \u2192 0 uniformly on any compact subset of \u03a0 \\ J, the difference\n\u03b5\nri (t, v w\u0304 +w\u0303 (t)) \u2212 ri (t, v w\u0304+w\u0303 (t)) tends to zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0 uniformly on any compact subset of\n(\u2202\u03a0 \\ {t = 0}) \\ J.\nIt remains to show that, for all i 6= j, the function\nPij\u03b5 (x, t)\n\n=\n\nZt\n\nti (x,t)\n\n\u0001\nEi (\u03c4 ; x, t)fij (\u03be, \u03c4 ) w\u0304j\u03b5 \u2212 w\u0304j (\u03be, \u03c4 )|\u03be=\u03c9i (\u03c4 ;x,t) d\u03c4\n\nconverges to zero as \u03b5 \u2192 0 uniformly on K. Fix an arbitrary \u03b51 \u2264 \u03b50 and split up the integral\ninto two parts, namely\nZ\nZ\n\u03b5\nd\u03c4,\nd\u03c4 +\nPij (x, t) =\n[ti (x,t),t]\u2212\u25b3\u03b51 (x,t)\n\n24\n\n\u25b3\u03b51 (x,t)\n\n\fwhere \u25b3\u03b51 (x, t) = {\u03c4 \u2208 [ti (x, t), t] : (\u03c9i (\u03c4 ; x, t), \u03c4 ) \u2208 J \u03b51 }. Since w\u0304j\u03b5 is uniformly bounded\non each bounded subset of \u03a0 and w\u0304 \u2208 C(\u03a0 \\ J), the absolute value of the second integral is\nbounded from above by C\u03b51 for all (x, t) \u2208 K and for some C > 0 which does not depend on \u03b51 .\nFurthermore, there exists \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b51 such that for all \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b52 the absolute value of the first integral\nis bounded from above by \u03b51 , due to the uniform convergence of w\u0304j\u03b5 off J \u03b51 . We hence conclude\nthat for each \u03b51 \u2264 \u03b50 there is \u03b52 \u2264 \u03b51 and a constant C > 0 such that for all (x, t) \u2208 K and\n\u03b5 \u2264 \u03b52 we have |Pij\u03b5 (x, t)| \u2264 C\u03b51 . Therefore, Q\u03b5ij (x, t) \u2192 0 as \u03b5 \u2192 0 uniformly on K. \u0003\nTo finish the proof of this part of the theorem, it remains to recall that problem (36) for w\nhas a unique solution of the form w\u0304 + w\u0303, where w\u0304 and w\u0303 are the unique solutions to problems\n(37) and (38), respectively.\n4. This part of the theorem is a direct consequence of the three preceding parts.\n\u0003\nIn Theorem 21 we established the existence of a delta wave solution to the problem under\nconsideration. Now we identify conditions under which this solution is smoothing. In the\nfollowing theorem conditions (\u03b9) and (\u03b9\u03b9) are supposed to be formulated correspondingly to\nproblem (1), (31), (32) .\nTheorem 22 Assume that the data \u03bbi , aij , gi , and pij are smooth functions in all their arguments and both ri and \u2207y ri are in L\u221e ((0, T ) \u00d7 Rn ) for any T > 0. Suppose that condition (5)\nis fulfilled.\n\u2022 Sufficiency. If condition (\u03b9) is true, then the delta wave solution to problem (1), (31), (32)\nis smoothing for any br \u2208 C[0, 1]n satisfying equalities (33).\n\u2022 Necessity. Assume that the delta wave solution to problem (1), (31), (32) is smoothing for\nany br \u2208 C[0, 1]n satisfying equalities (33). Then condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is fulfilled.\nProof. Sufficiency. As condition (\u03b9) is true, there exists T0 such that J\u2217 \u2208 \u03a0T0 and the\nrestriction of u to \u03a0 \\ \u03a0T0 equals w. The smoothingness of u will follow from Theorem 12 and\nT\nfrom the fact that there is T > T0 such that w is continuous on \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 . To prove the latter, fix\nT to be a supremum over t > 0 such that there is x \u2208 [0, 1] and an EP jointing the point (x, t)\nT\nwith the line t =P\nT0 . Note that u on \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 fulfills the system of integral equations (10)\u2013(11)\nn\nwhere hi (t, v) = j=1 pij (t)vj (t) + ri (t, v). By the choice of T , the right hand side of (10) can\nbe rewritten in the form involving integrals of kind Iijs (x, t) defined by (12). This expression\nwill not depend neither on v nor on u(x, T0 ). We therefore can use a transformation of Iijs (x, t)\nT\nsimilar to that made in (13). Since u is piecewise continuous on \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 , the right hand side of\nT\n(13) is a continuous function on \u03a0 \\ \u03a0 , as desired.\nNecessity. By Theorem 21, the delta wave solution is given by the sum of a regular part w\nin C(\u03a0 \\ J)n and a singular part z \u2208 D \u2032 (\u03a0) which, in its turn, is the sum of strong singularities\nconcentrated on the characteristic curves contributing into the set J\u2217 . By the assumption, the\ndelta wave solution is smoothing for each br \u2208 C[0, 1]n . This entails the smoothingness of both\nthe regular and the singular parts of the solution. It remains to note that condition (\u03b9\u03b9) is\nnecessary for smoothingness of w. This follows by similar argument that was used to prove the\nnecessity in Theorem 12.\n\u0003\n25\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by a Humboldt Research Fellowship.
