The flux of solar neutrinos\nat higher energies depends on the branching between\nthe 3 He(3 He,2p)\u03b1 and 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reactions, and in\nbig-bang nucleosynthesis 7 Li can be produced via the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction and subsequent electron\ncapture of 7 Be [1]. While the energy range of big-bang\nnucleosynthesis is covered by experimental data, the experiments are approaching the Gamow window around\nE0 = 22 keV of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction in the sun, but\nstill have not reached E0 .\nVery recently, it has been attempted successfully to\nextend the measured energy range of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be\nreaction to higher energies up to about 3.2 MeV [2].\nFrom these new experimental data the energy dependence of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction can be extracted and compared to theoretical predictions. A better theoretical understanding of the energy dependence\nwill help to reduce the uncertainties of the extrapolation of the cross section down to the Gamow window\nat the temperature of the interior of our sun. Several\nfurther experimental data sets exist at lower energies\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] that\nare summarized in two recent compilations [18, 19].\nBesides theoretical calculations shown in the experimental papers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n15, 16, 17], various theoretical studies have been devoted\nto the analysis of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section\n[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,\n35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Additionally, a review on the status\nof the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction is given in [40].\nTheoretical models can be significantly constrained by\nthe request that elastic scattering data have to be described simultaneously with the capture data. Phase\nshifts have been derived from elastic scattering angular\n\ndistributions in [41, 42, 43], and angular distributions\nor excitation functions at low energies are reported in\n[31, 44, 45, 46].\nIt will be shown that the capture cross section of the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction at low energies is dominated by E1\ntransitions from incoming s- and d-waves to bound pstates in 7 Be. Consequently, a precise description of the\ns-wave and d-wave phase shifts is a prerequisite for the\ncalculation of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Sec. II a brief\ndescription of the direct capture model is provided. General remarks on the applicability and reliability of this\nmodel and other theoretical calculations are given in\nSec. III. Results for the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He elastic scattering\nand 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross sections are presented in\nSec. IV, and theoretical uncertainties are carefully analyzed. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. V, and finally a\nbrief summary is given in Sec. VI.\nAll energies E are given in the center-of-mass system\nthroughout this paper except explicitly noted. Excitation\nenergies E \u2217 in 7 Be are related to E by E \u2217 = E + Q with\nthe Q-value of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction Q = 1586.6 keV\n[47].\nII.\n\nTHE DIRECT CAPTURE MODEL\n\nThe direct capture (DC) model is a simple but powerful model to calculate capture cross sections between\nlight nuclei. The full formalism is given explicitly in [48],\nand its application together with systematic folding potentials is described in detail in our previous work on the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He and 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reactions [31]. Here I only\nrepeat some essential features of the DC model that are\nimportant for the following discussion.\nThe theoretical capture cross section \u03c3th is given by\nthe product of the DC cross section \u03c3DC and the spectroscopic factor C 2 S of the final state:\n\u03c3th = C 2 S \u00d7 \u03c3DC\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nWidmaierMohr@t-online.de\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe DC cross section depends on the square of the over-\n\n\f2\nlap between the scattering wave function \u03c7Li ,Ji (r), the\nbound state wave function uN,Lf ,Jf (r), and the electromagnetic operator OE1,E2,M1 of E1, E2, and M 1 transitions:\nZ\n2\n\u03c3DC \u223c\n\u03c7Li ,Ji (r) OE1,E2,M1 uN,Lf ,Jf (r) dr\n(2.2)\nwhere Li , Ji and Lf , Jf are the angular momenta in the\ninitial scattering wave function \u03c7(r) and the final bound\nstate wave function u(r). N is the number of nodes in the\nbound state wave function that takes into account the\nWildermuth condition. The total number of oscillator\nquanta Q = 2N + Lf = 3 for three nucleons in the 1p\nshell leads to two cluster states in 7 Be. There is a first\nstate with one node (N = 1) and angular momentum\nL = 1, and a second state without node (N = 0) and\nL = 3. Both states are split into dubletts because of the\nspin S = 1/2 of the 3 He nucleus. Both L = 1 states\nare located below the 3 He-\u03b1 threshold in 7 Be, whereas\nthe L = 3 states are located above the threshold and\nmay appear as resonances in the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture\nreaction. Properties of the cluster states are given in\nTable I, and a simplified level scheme of 7 Be is shown in\nFig. 1.\n7\n\nTABLE I: Level scheme of Be. Experimental data are taken\nfrom [47].

Fig. 3\nshows the integrand of Eq. (2.2), i.e. the overlap of the\nscattering wave function \u03c7(r), the electromagnetic operator O, and the bound state wave function u(r) for different transitions in the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction at\na very low (100 keV) and at a higher energy (3 MeV). A\ndetailed discussion will be given in the following Sec. III.\nThe basic ingredient for the calculation of the DC integral in Eq. (2.2) are the potentials for the entrance\nchannel (elastic scattering) and the exit channel (bound\nstate wave function). As soon as the potentials are fixed,\nthe DC integral is calculated without further adjustment of parameters to experimental capture data. The\nspectroscopic factor C 2 S of the bound state is taken \u2013\nexactly as in [31] \u2013 from theory in the present study:\nC 2 S(3/2\u2212) = 1.174 and C 2 S(1/2\u2212 ) = 1.175 [49].

Excitation energies E \u2217 are given in keV.\nAll data are taken from [47].\n\nspectroscopic factor is considered as an absolute normalization for the calculated capture cross section, similar\nto the procedure in [50]. It is beyond the scope of the\npresent paper to discuss the relation between the asymptotic normalization coefficient and the spectroscopic factor as e.g. in [51] because the main conclusions of this\nwork are not affected.\nThe potential for the 3 He \u2212 \u03b1 system is the sum of the\ncentral nuclear potential, the spin-orbit potential, and\nthe Coulomb potential. The real part of the central nuclear potential is calculated from the double folding procedure [52, 53] that is scaled by a strength parameter \u03bb\nwhich is about 1.4 \u2212 1.8 in this study. The underlying\nnuclear densities are derived from the measured charge\ndensity distributions [54]. The imaginary part of the nuclear potential can be set to zero because there are no\nopen channels below 4 MeV except the relatively weak\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture. The spin-orbit potential is taken\nin the usual Thomas form proportional to 1/r \u00d7 dV /dr,\nagain scaled by a spin-orbit strength parameter \u03bbLS . Finally, the Coulomb potential VC is calculated from the\nhomogeneous charged sphere model with a Coulomb radius RC identical to the root-mean-square radius of the\nfolding potential: RC = rrms = 2.991 fm. Further details\ncan be found in [31]. The total potential is given by:\nV (r) = \u03bb VF (r) + \u03bbLS\n\nfm2 dVF (r) ~ ~\nLS + VC (r)\nr\ndr\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith the unscaled (\u03bb = 1) folding potential VF (r). The\nfactor fm2 in the spin-orbit potential is added to obtain\n~ S,\n~ and J~ =\na dimensionless strength parameter \u03bbLS .

The shape of the\npotential is fixed by the folding procedure. Only the\nstrength parameters \u03bb and \u03bbLS have to be adjusted to\nexperimental data. Obviously, the small number of adjustable parameters improves the predictive power of the\ncalculations.\nThe shape of the folding potential for 3 He \u2212 \u03b1 is almost\nGaussian. Consequently, the spin-orbit part has almost\nthe same shape, and the sum of central and spin-orbit\npotential again has the same shape. In other words, the\nspin-orbit potential slightly increases the potential for\nJ = L+1/2 waves and slightly decreases the potential for\nthe J = L \u2212 1/2 waves but keeps the shape of the folding\npotential. Alternatively, the same effect can be obtained\nif the spin-orbit potential is set to zero and instead the\nstrength parameter of the central potential becomes Jdependent. This approach has been followed e.g. in [32]:\nthere very similar results to our previous work [31] were\nobtained using empirical Gaussian potentials with a Jdependent depth V0 .\nIII.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\nThe nucleus 7 Be and the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He elastic scattering and 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reactions are textbook examples for the successful application of a simple two-body\n\nFIG. 3: Overlap of the scattering wave function \u03c7(r), electromagnetic transition operator O, and bound state wave function u(r) for different transitions of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction.

Early calculations\nhave been performed for the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction using\nhard-sphere phase shifts for the entrance channel, thus\nconsidering external capture only. Already these early\ncalculations have successfully reproduced the cross section of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction at low energies\n[20, 21, 22]. Nowadays it must be the aim of theoretical studies to reproduce simultaneously the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He\nelastic scattering cross sections and phase shifts, the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction, and electromagnetic properties of the 7 Be nucleus. Often also the mirror nucleus\n7\nLi and the mirror reaction 3 H(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Li are considered.\nThe present study focuses on the new results for the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction [2]; the 7 Li mirror system was already studied in our earlier work [31].\n\n\f4\nOnly very few radiation widths \u0393\u03b3 or lifetimes \u03c4 have\nbeen measured for the 7 Be nucleus. The first excited\n1/2\u2212 state in 7 Be decays by a M 1 transition to the 7 Be\nground state with a lifetime of \u03c4m = 192 \u00b1 25 fs [47] corresponding to B(M 1, 3/2\u2212 \u2192 1/2\u2212 ) = 1.87 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bc2N .\nFollowing the formalism in [38, 55, 56], the reduced transition strength B(M 1, 3/2\u2212 \u2192 1/2\u2212) is given by\n\u00032\n1 \u0002 3\n2\n2\u03bc( He) \u2212 \u03bcN G < u3/2\u2212 |u1/2\u2212 >\n4\u03c0\n(3.1)\nwith the effective cluster-cluster orbital gyromagnetic\nfactor G = (Z1 A22 + Z2 A21 )/[A1 A2 (A1 + A2 )] = 0.5952\nfor 7 Be = 3 He \u2297 \u03b1 and \u03bc(3 He) = \u22122.1276 \u03bcN [57]. As\nalready pointed out in [30], the overlap of the bound\n2\nstate wave functions < u3/2\u2212 |u1/2\u2212 > is close to\nunity because both wave functions u(r) are very similar. This similarity is also obvious for the wave functions\nin this study, see Fig. 2; here the overlap deviates by\nless than one per cent from unity. Consequently, the reduced transition strength B(M 1) is practically defined\n\u0002 3\n\u00032\n1\nby the factor 4\u03c0\n2\u03bc( He) \u2212 \u03bcN G = 1.873 \u03bc2N which\nis in excellent agreement with the experimental result of\n1.87 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bc2N . The excellent reproduction of the B(M 1)\ntransition strength between the 3/2\u2212 ground state and\nthe 1/2\u2212 first excited state in 7 Be is thus a more or less\ntrivial result for any two-body calculation with realistic\nbound state wave functions.\nThe E2 contribution of this transition is orders of magnitude smaller than the M 1 transition because of the\nrelatively low transition energy of E\u03b3 = 429 keV and\nthe strong E\u03b35 dependence of E2 transitions: one E2\nWeisskopf unit corresponds to a radiation width of about\n\u0393\u03b3 (E2) \u2248 10 neV which has to be compared to the experimental M 1 width of \u0393\u03b3 = 3.4 meV.\nNo further experimental data for radiation widths in\n7\nBe exist in [47]. However, the recent experiment [2] has\nmeasured the cross section of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction\nin the 7/2\u2212 resonance for the first time, and it was possible to derive the radiation width \u0393\u03b3,0 in [2]. It will\nbe shown in Sec. IV B that the DC model is able to reproduce the experimental value within its relatively large\nexperimental uncertainty. Contrary to the above studied\nM 1 transition, this result is not trivial because it requires\nthe overlap of the 7/2\u2212 scattering wave function, the E2\noperator, and the 3/2\u2212 ground state wave function (see\nFig. 3, lower part).\nOften, \"direct capture\" is also named \"extranuclear\ncapture\" or \"non-resonant capture\". The origin of these\nsomewhat misleading names comes from the early calculations by Christy and Duck [20] and Tombrello and\ncoworkers [21, 22]. A good description of the experimental 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section was obtained\nin [20, 21, 22] using hard-sphere phase shifts for the\nnon-resonant s- and d-waves (that are by definition nonresonant). As can be seen from Fig. 3 (upper and middle parts), the main contribution of the E1 transitions\nfrom incoming s-waves and d-waves to the bound L = 1\nB(M 1) =\n\nstates comes indeed from the nuclear exterior, thus validating the hard-sphere approximation for the s-waves\nand d-waves in [20, 21, 22]. However, as can be seen from\nFig. 3 (lower part), the main contribution of the E2 transition from the incoming f -wave to the 3/2\u2212 ground state\ncomes from the exterior at the low energy of E = 100 keV,\nbut is shifted to the interior at E = 3.0 MeV which is in\nthe 7/2\u2212 resonance. Thus, the terminus \"direct capture\"\nis neither identical to \"extranuclear capture\" nor to \"nonresonant capture\". This has also been illustrated for the\n3+ resonance in the 2 H(\u03b1,\u03b3)6 Li reaction in [58].\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nElastic scattering cross sections and phase shifts\n\nAs already pointed out above, the parameters of the\npotential \u2013 i.e. the potential strength parameters \u03bb and\n\u03bbLS \u2013 have to be adjusted to experimental data. Elastic\nscattering phase shifts are typically used for this adjustment. Such phase shifts have been derived from angular\ndistributions and excitation functions over a broad range\nof energies [41, 42, 43], see Fig. 4.\nThe data of Spiger and Tombrello cover the energy\nrange slightly below the 7/2\u2212 resonance and range from\nabout 2.5 MeV up to 10 MeV [41]. The data of Boykin\net al. cover the energy range from about 1.9 MeV up\nto 4 MeV. However, no numerical results are given for\nthe important d-waves. Instead, it is pointed out that\n\"the values obtained at the various energies were scattered with no discernible trend in a band between \u22124\u25e6\nand +4\u25e6 \" [42]. The data from Hardy et al. start above\nthe 7/2\u2212 resonance and range from about 3.3 MeV up to\n7.7 MeV [43].\nThe adjustment of the potential strength parameters\n\u03bb and \u03bbLS is done as follows. The procedure is almost\nidentical to the previous work [31] with a modification\nof the spin-orbit potential. First, the strength parameter \u03bb is adjusted to the s-wave phase shift. This can\nbe done unambiguously because the s-wave is not affected by the spin-orbit potential. An excellent agreement with the experimental phase shifts is obtained with\n\u03bb(L = 0) = 1.452 (full black line in Fig. 4, upper part).\nAdditionally, the results are shown for a variation of the\nstrength parameter \u03bb between 1.4 and 1.6 (green dashed,\nred dotted, and blue narrow-dashed lines) that will be\nimportant for the analysis of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture\ncross section in Sec. IV B.\nThe parameter \u03bb(L = 0) = 1.452 is also used for the\nd-wave phase shifts. As can be seen from Fig. 4, there is\nexcellent agreement with the experimental d-wave phase\nshifts over a broad energy range. There is no evidence for\na different behavior of the d3/2 and d5/2 phase shifts from\nthe data in [41, 42, 43]. Thus, the spin-orbit potential\nhas to vanish for the d-waves, and \u03bbLS (L = 2) = 0. It\nis interesting to note that any deviation of the potential\nstrength from \u03bb = 1.452 leads to deviations of the calcu-\n\n\f5\n\n+\n\n(1/2 ) (deg)\n\n0\n\nSpiger et al. (1967)\nBoykin et al.

Experimental data are taken from [41, 42, 43].\nCalculations are performed using the potential strength parameters \u03bbeven = 1.452, \u03bbeven\n= 0, \u03bbodd = 1.830 and\nLS\nodd\n\u03bbLS = \u22120.173 (standard case, full black line). The parameter \u03bbeven is varied between 1.40 and 1.60 (\u03bbeven = 1.40: green\ndashed line; \u03bbeven = 1.50: red dotted line; \u03bbeven = 1.60: blue\nnarrow-dashed line), and the spin-orbit strength of the odd\npartial waves has also been used for the even partial waves\n(\u03bbeven = 1.452, \u03bbeven\nLS = \u22120.173: magenta dash-dotted line).\nFurther discussion see text.\n\nlated d-wave phase shifts from the experimentally vanishing data. Combining the results for the s-wave and the\nd-waves, the potential strength parameters for even partial waves are \u03bbeven = 1.452 and \u03bbeven\nLS = 0. A test with\nthe spin-orbit strength derived from the f -waves (see below) also shows clear disagreement to the experimental\nd-wave phase shifts (magenta dash-dotted line in Fig. 4).\nA noticeably higher value for the potential strength \u03bb\nis found for the odd partial waves. \u03bbodd and \u03bbodd\nLS have\nbeen adjusted to reproduce the energies of the f -wave\nresonances (see Fig. 4). This leads to \u03bbodd = 1.830 and\n\u03bbodd\nLS = \u22120.173. Using these values, an excellent agreement for the f -wave phase shifts is obtained in both nonresonant and resonant energy regions. In particular, the\nresonance widths are properly reproduced (see also Table\nI). Good agreement with the experimental p-wave phase\nshifts is also obtained with the above \u03bbodd and \u03bbodd\nLS . The\nparameters \u03bbodd and \u03bbodd\nwere\nnot\nvaried\nin\nthe\nfollowLS\ning study because any change of these parameters shifts\nthe f -wave resonances dramatically in energy.\nThe new experimental 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture data cover\nan energy range that is at the lower end of the experimental phase shift data of [41, 42, 43]. Fortunately, further experimental angular distributions of 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He\nelastic scattering are available in [31, 44, 46] in the relevant energy range of the new 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be experiment [2].\nThese experimental angular distributions are compared\nto the calculated cross sections using the above deterodd\nmined parameters \u03bbeven = 1.452, \u03bbeven\n= 1.830\nLS = 0, \u03bb\nodd\nand \u03bbLS = \u22120.173. The result is shown in Fig. 5 (full\nblack lines). Additionally, again the sensitivity on the potential strength parameters \u03bbeven and \u03bbeven\nLS is analyzed\n(colored dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 5).\nThe conclusions from Fig. 5 are clear. As expected,\nan excellent agreement between the experimental data\nand the calculations is only obtained using the same parameters as derived from the phase shifts of [41, 42, 43]\nin Fig. 4. From the shown angular distributions the parameter \u03bbeven may vary between 1.40 and 1.45; a careful inspection of the phase shift calculations in Fig. 4\nshows that the low-energy s-wave phase shifts of [42] and\nthe overall energy dependence are best described using\n\u03bbeven = 1.45; however, the data from [41] are better\ndesribed using \u03bbeven = 1.40 (green dashed line in Fig. 4).\nBecause of the better overall description of the s-wave\nphase shifts and the excellent description of the d-wave\nphase shifts I take \u03bbeven = 1.45, \u03bbeven\nLS = 0 as the standard calculation in the following, keeping \u03bbodd = 1.830\nand \u03bbodd\nLS = \u22120.173 fixed for the odd partial waves. An\nadditional calculation with \u03bbeven = 1.45, \u03bbeven\nLS = \u22120.173\n(instead of \u03bbeven\nLS = 0) is almost identical to the previous\ncalculation in [31] except minor technical modifications\n(e.g. larger integration range and smaller step size).\nA minor disagreement between the calculated angular\ndistribution and the experimental data can be seen at\nE = 2715 keV. This is not very surprising because this energy is at the low-energy tail of the 7/2\u2212 resonance. The\nwidth of this resonance is slightly underestimated: the\n\n\f6\n5\n\nE = 1407 keV\n\nE = 1597 keV\n\nE = 1711 keV\n\nE = 2053 keV\n\n3\n\n/\n\nR\n\n4\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n3\n\nB.\n\nThe 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section\n\n/\n\nR\n\n4\n\nthe next Sec. IV B.\nSummarizing the above, an excellent agreement between all experimental scattering data (phase shifts and\nangular distributions) and the calculated values is obtained using the above derived potential strength parameters \u03bbeven = 1.452, \u03bbeven\n= 0, \u03bbodd = 1.830 and\nLS\n\u03bbodd\n=\n\u22120.173\n(standard\ncase).\nThe results of all scatLS\ntering experiments are consistent with each other and can\nbe well described using the present model.\nThe scattering wave functions can now be calculated\nwithout further adjustment of parameters. Because of\nthe dominating external capture (see Fig. 3), good agreement between the predicted and experimental capture\ncross sections has to be expected.

Experimental data are taken from [31, 44]. The linestyle and\ncolor coding is identical to Fig. 4; the dotted black line at\nE = 2715 keV shows the artificial enhancement of the contribution of the 7/2\u2212 resonance (see text).\n\ncalculated width is \u0393calc = 145 keV which has to be compared to the experimental width of \u0393exp = 175 \u00b1 7 keV\n(see also Table I). A much better agreement is obtained\nif the resonance contribution is artificially enhanced in\nthe calculation by an increase of the phase shift of the\n7/2\u2212 partial wave by about 5\u25e6 from 10\u25e6 in the standard\ncalculation to 15\u25e6 (dotted black line in Fig. 5). The deviation is clearly not related to the potential strength of\nthe even partial waves which will be most important for\nthe analysis of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section in\n\nIn addition to the scattering wave function \u03c7(r), the\ndetermination of the DC cross section in Eqs. (2.1) and\n(2.2) requires the calculation of the bound state wave\nfunction u(r). Because of the contributions from the\nnuclear exterior (see Fig. 3), it is essential that the\ncalculated bound state wave function has the correct\nasymptotic behavior that is defined by the binding energy. This leads to a slight readjustment of the potential\nstrength parameter \u03bb for the bound states compared to\nthe above results for the scattering phase shifts. The results are \u03bb(3/2\u2212 ) = 1.836 for the ground state of 7 Be\nat E = \u22121587 keV and \u03bb(1/2\u2212 ) = 1.799 for the first excited state of 7 Be at E = \u22121158 keV (E \u2217 = 429 keV). No\nspin-orbit potential has been used here.\nThe remaining calculation of the DC cross section is\nstraightforward and does not require any adjustment to\nexperimental capture data. The results are shown in\nFig. 6 with a comparison to the available experimental\ndata and in Fig. 7 in a broader energy range. The calculations take into account all possible E1, E2, and M 1\ncontributions from the incoming scattering waves with\nL = 0 \u2212 3. However, as has been shown in several previous studies, the E1 contribution is dominating at all\nenergies. Only in the 7/2\u2212 and 5/2\u2212 resonances a noticeable E2 contribution is found, and the M 1 contribution remains negligible over the whole energy range. A\ndecomposition into the various contributions has already\nbeen shown in Fig. 5 of [22], Fig. 8 of [23], Fig. 8 of [24],\nFig. 2 of [26], Fig. 7 of [31], Fig. 2 of [32], Fig. 8 of [35],\nand Fig. 5 of [38], and is thus not repeated here.\nThe standard calculation (using the potential strength\nparameters from the adjustment to the experimental\nphase shifts) shows an excellent agreement with the total\nS-factor and the branching ratio R = \u03c3429 /\u03c30 in the lowenergy region below 1 MeV.

For both resonances it is obvious that the\ntotal width \u0393 is practically identical to the alpha particle\nwidth \u0393\u03b1 . As already shown in Table I, the calculated\nwidths \u0393calc agree reasonably well with the experimental\nresults \u0393exp . This is also obvious from correct description\nof the resonant behavior of the L = 3 elastic phase shifts\nin Fig. 4.\nThe 7/2\u2212 resonance at 2983 keV decays by an E2 transition to the 3/2\u2212 ground state of 7 Be whereas no E2\ntransition to the first ecited 1/2\u2212 state is possible. A\nBreit-Wigner fit to the calculated capture cross section\nin this resonance leads to a radiation width \u0393\u03b3 = \u0393\u03b3,0 =\n37 meV and a resonance strength \u03c9\u03b3 = 150 meV. This\nprediction is in reasonable agreement with the experimental result of \u03c9\u03b3 = 330 \u00b1 210 meV [2].\nThe 5/2\u2212 resonance at 5143 keV was not measured\nyet in the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction. The DC model predicts \u0393\u03b3,0 \u2248 50 meV for the E2 transition to the 3/2\u2212\nground state and \u0393\u03b3,429 \u2248 185 meV for the E2 tran-\n\n3\n\n0.1\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nE (keV)\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Astrophysical S-factor and branching\nratio R = \u03c3429 /\u03c30 for the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction. Experimental data are taken from [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,\n12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The linestyles and color codes are the\nsame as in Figs. 4 and 5. The vertical arrows on top indicate the energies of the angular distributions in the previous\nFig. 5 where the elastic scattering cross sections are well reproduced. These scattering data cover the energy range of the\nrecent 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture data [2] (shown as open squares).\n\ntion on the underlying potential has been studied in the\nsame way as in the previous Sec. IV A by a variation of\nthe \u03bb and \u03bbLS potential strength parameters. The results\nare also shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In general, an increasing potential strength leads to an increasing S-factor. A\n\n\f8\nsition to the first excited 1/2\u2212 state. This leads to\n\u0393\u03b3 = \u0393\u03b3,0 + \u0393\u03b3,429 \u2248 235 meV or a total resonance\nstrength \u03c9\u03b3 \u2248 0.7 eV. Because of the huge width of this\nresonance, any determination of resonance parameters\nhas relatively large uncertainties. An additional theoretical uncertainty is related to the opening of the 6 Li-p\nchannel slightly above 4 MeV.\nIt is interesting to note that the different decay patterns of the 7/2\u2212 and 5/2\u2212 resonances are clearly visible\nin the branching ratio R although the E2 contribution to\nthe total cross section is small compared to the dominating E1 transitions. Fig. 7 clearly shows a smaller branching ratio in the 7/2\u2212 resonance around 3 MeV which can\nonly decay to the 3/2\u2212 ground state, and a larger branching ratio in the 5/2\u2212 resonance around 5 MeV which predominantly decays to the 1/2\u2212 first excited state.\nThe S-factor at very low energies is extrapolated down\nto S(0) using the following procedure. The calculated\ncross sections are fitted using a second-order polynomial\nup to 500 keV. The results for S(0) and S \u2032 (0)/S(0) are\nlisted in Table II for the different potentials shown in\nFigs. 4, 5, 6, and 7. The standard case leads to S(0) =\n0.53 keV b and S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.73 MeV\u22121 , in agreement\nwith the compilation of solar fusion cross sections by\nAdelberger et al. [18] who recommend S(0) = 0.53 \u00b1\n0.05 keV b and S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.57 MeV\u22121 , and the\nNACRE compilation [19] where S(0) = 0.54 \u00b1 0.09 keV b\nand S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.96 MeV\u22121 are given. The recent summary of Cyburt and Davids [40] recommends\na slightly higher value of S(0) = 0.580 \u00b1 0.043 keV b\nand S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.92 \u00b1 0.18 MeV\u22121 . Variations of\nthe order of about 10 % for the slope of the S-factor\nat zero energy are found using the different potentials.\nSuch variations are also typical for the different theoretical calculations in [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,\n29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. The adopted\nS \u2032 (0)/S(0) [18, 19, 40] show somewhat larger variations.\nThe average of the three compilations of S \u2032 (0)/S(0) =\n\u22120.82 MeV\u22121 is in reasonable agreement with the calculated S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.73 MeV\u22121 in the standard case\nand in perfect agreement with the calculation using\n\u03bbeven = 1.40 where S \u2032 (0)/S(0) = \u22120.79 MeV\u22121 is found.\nHowever, larger values \u03bbeven > 1.50 correspond to lower\nS \u2032 (0)/S(0).\nUsing the standard case potential, S(0) = 0.53 keV b\nis predicted from the present study. This prediction depends on the theoretical spectroscopic factors C 2 S of the\nbound state wave functions. From the excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated capture\ncross sections and branching ratios at low energies (see\nFig. 6) it is obvious that the chosen theoretical spectroscopic factors [49] are correct within about 10 %. Any\nminor readjustment of these spectroscopic factors will affect the the calculated capture cross sections linearly at\nall energies, but will not affect the calculated energy dependence of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section. Also\nthe normalized slope S \u2032 (0)/S(0) will not be affected by\na readjustment of the spectroscopic factors.\n\nTABLE II: Extrapolated astrophysical S-factor S(0) at zero\nenergy and its normalized derivative S \u2032 (0)/S(0) for different\npotentials.

An additional introduction of effective charges in\nthe model may affect the absolute values of the DC cross\nsections. Because of the dominating E1 contribution to\nthe capture cross section, the introduction of effective\ncharges does not affect the calculated energy dependence\nin a significant way. Similar to the statements on the\nspectroscopic factor in the previous paragraph, effective\ncharges do also not affect the normalized slope S \u2032 (0)/S(0)\nof the astrophysical S-factor. Although effective charges\ncannot be determined from scattering phase shifts, it is\nobvious from the excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated cross sections at low energies\nthat the effective charges cannot deviate strongly from\nthe used real charges.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been shown in the previous Sects. IV A and\nIV B that the standard calculation with the parameters\nodd\n\u03bbeven = 1.45, \u03bbeven\n= 1.83, and \u03bbodd\nLS = 0, \u03bb\nLS = \u22120.173\nis able to describe elastic scattering phase shifts for\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He reaction in the full energy range up to about\n8 MeV and the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross sections to\nthe 7 Be ground state and first excited state at low energies. At higher energies the calculation agrees with\nthe old data [4] but disagrees with the new data [2]. In\nthe following discussion the theoretical uncertainties will\nbe analyzed, and the question will be answered whether\nthe new data of [2] can be described within the present\nmodel. Most of the considerations will also be valid for\nother models because of the dominating external contributions to the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross section. The\ndiscussion will focus on the dominating E1 contributions\nfrom the incoming s-wave and d-wave.\nThe analysis of elastic scattering clearly shows that the\ns-wave and d-wave phase shifts can only be reproduced\n\n\f9\nusing the potential strength of the standard calculation\n(see Figs. 4 and 5). For the s-wave \u03bbeven = 1.40 \u2212 1.45\nis the acceptable range. The d-wave phase shifts which\nremain close to zero up to about 8 MeV can only be described with \u03bb values very close to \u03bbeven = 1.45. A value\nof \u03bbeven > 1.50 can clearly be excluded. This is further\nstrengthened by the analysis of the slope S \u2032 (0)/S(0) at\nlow energies, see Table II.\nThe integrand of the DC integral in Eq. (2.2), i.e. the\noverlap between scattering wave function \u03c7(r), electromagnetic operator OE1 , and bound state wave function\nu(r), is shown for the standard calculation in Fig. 3. The\nupper part shows the E1 transition from the s-wave to\nthe ground state and first excited state, and the middle part shows the E1 transition from the d-wave to the\nground state in 7 Be. As usual, the integrand is shifted\ntowards the exterior for lower energies. But it has to\nbe pointed out that all curves are clearly dominated by\ncontributions from far outside the nucleus at both considered energies E = 100 keV and 3 MeV; i.e., also at\nthe high energy E = 3 MeV the external contribution\ndominates. Thus, the result of the DC calculation is essentially defined by the behavior of the scattering wave\nfunction \u03c7(r) and the bound state wave function u(r) at\nradii between 5 fm and 35 fm that is much larger than the\nsize of 7 Be. Any calculation with realistic nuclear potentials should provide a more or less similar capture cross\nsection if the potential is able to reproduce the elastic\nphase shifts. This is particularly true for the calculated\nenergy dependence.\nThe absolute value of the bound state wave function\nu(r) in the external region depends indirectly on the chosen potential shape. The slope of the external part of\nthe bound state wave function u(r) is well defined by the\nbinding energy, but the normalization of the bound state\nwave function u(r)\nZ \u221e\nu2 (r) dr = 1\n(5.1)\n0\n\nhas its main contribution from smaller radii r < 5 fm,\ni.e. from the nuclear interior and surface (see Fig. 2). In\nline with the considerations in [50], the chosen spectroscopic factors C 2 S \u2248 1.2 for the ground state and first\nexcited state in 7 Be simply mean here that the bound\nstate wave functions \u221a\nu(r) in the nuclear exterior have to\nbe scaled by a factor C 2 S \u2248 1.1 to bring the calculated\nDC cross section into agreement with the experimental\ndata at low energies. The choice of a different potential leads to a different shape of the wave function u(r)\nand its asymptotic behavior that can be compensated by\na different spectroscopic factor. Finally, the theoretical\ncross section, in particular its energy dependence, will remain almost unaffected \u2013 provided that the phase shifts\nare well reproduced.\nNevertheless, an attempt has been made to reproduce the new 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture data [2] within the\npresent model. In general, an increasing nuclear potential strength decreases the Coulomb barrier and thus in-\n\ncreases the calculated capture cross section. A value of\n\u03bbeven \u2248 1.6 is required to reproduce the larger cross section data of [2]. The calculated capture cross section\nat low energies is increased by about 15 % compared to\nthe standard case which is slightly higher than the allowed range of the precision experiments at low energies.\nThis larger potential strength also leads to a strong disagreement with the scattering data. In particular, the\nelastic scattering angular distributions in Fig. 5 cannot\nbe described with the increased value of \u03bbeven = 1.6.\nThese angular distributions have been measured in an\nenergy range that covers the energy range of the recent\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture data [2] (indicated by the arrows\non top of Fig. 6). Taking into account the above considerations on the radial behavior of the overlap integral in\nEq. (2.2), it can be excluded that the DC model is able\nto reproduce simultaneously 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He elastic scattering [31, 41, 42, 43, 44] and 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture [2] at\nenergies around 2 \u2212 3 MeV.\nIt is interesting to note that the branching ratio R =\n\u03c3429 /\u03c30 is practically not affected by the variation of the\npotential strength of the s- and d-waves because both\ntransitions are increased in the same way when \u03bbeven is\nincreased from its standard value of 1.45 to about 1.6 to\nfit the higher capture data of [2]. However, the branching\nratio R is significantly affected by the spin-orbit potential of the d-wave. Using the spin-orbit potential strength\nfrom the odd partial waves also for the even partial waves\neven\n(\u03bbeven\nLS = \u22120.173 instead of the standard case \u03bbLS = 0),\nthe effective strength of the potential for the d5/2 (d3/2 )\nwave is increased (decreased). As pointed out above, an\nincreased potential strength leads to increased capture\ncross sections. Because there is only an E1 transition\nfrom the d5/2 wave to the 3/2\u2212 ground state, but no\nE1 transition to the 1/2\u2212 first excited state, the ground\nstate contribution is enhanced, and thus the branching\nratio R decreases at higher energies (see Figs. 6 and 7).\nHowever, at low energies the dominating contribution to\nthe capture cross section comes from the s-wave which is\nnot affected by the spin-orbit potential, and the branching ratio R at very low energies is practically identical to\nthe standard case.\nIt is difficult to find an explanation for the discrepancy between the calculated 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture cross\nsections and the recent experimental data [2]. Experimental scattering data have been obtained in a series of\nindependent experiments [31, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46] that\nagree well with each other. The determination of the\nscattering wave function in the DC integral in Eq. (2.2)\nis thus very well-defined. Although the requested accuracy of a few per cent for astrophysical modelling has\nnot yet been achieved for the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction, all experimental capture data at low energies agree\nwithin each other at a 10 \u2212 15 % level. The spectroscopic\nfactors \u2013 taken as normalization factors in Eq. (2.2) \u2013\nare thus also well-defined at this level. The same level of\naccuracy should then be expected for the energy range\nof the new 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture data [2] up to about\n\n\f10\n3 MeV. Instead, the standard calculation underestimates\nthe new capture data by about 30 \u2212 40 %. It has to be\npointed out that a wrong normalization of the new data\n[2] is also very unlikely because the experiment has studied the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction very carefully using\nthree different independent techniques (recoil detection,\n\u03b3 detection, and activation) that agree very well with\neach other at the level of a few per cent. Of course, an\nindependent confirmation of the new data in [2] is nevertheless highly desireable, in particular, because of the\ndiscrepancy between the old data in [4] and the new data\nin [2].\nThe only remaining explanation is that the DC model\nitself is not appropriate for the description of the\n3\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be capture reaction. However, even \"exotic\"\ntheoretical solutions like other electromagnetic transitions (except E1, E2, and M 1) or further unobserved\nbound states in 7 Be can be excluded at the requested\nlevel of 30 \u2212 40 % from the agreement of the different\nexperimental techniques in [2]. And because of the dominating exteral contributions to the DC cross section,\nany theoretical calculation that reproduces the scattering\nphase shifts, should provide a similar theoretical energy\ndependence and thus underestimate the new capture data\nfor the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction in [2] in a similar way.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nmodel together with folding potentials. It is shown that\nthe elastic scattering phase shifts are well reproduced\nover a broad energy range. Whereas the low-energy\ncapture data are well described simultaneously with the\nphase shifts, there is a significant underestimation of the\nrecent capture data [2], but agreement with the old data\nof [4]. As the DC calculation is very well constrained by\nexperimental scattering data over the whole energy range\nstudied in [2], it is difficult to find an explanation for the\ndiscrepancy between the calculated and the recently measured capture cross section of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be reaction.\nFurther eperimental and theoretical effort is needed to\nresolve this surprising problem.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He elastic scattering and 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b3)7 Be\ncapture cross sections have been studied within the DC\n\nEncouraging discussions and all the support in reconstructing old experimental data is gratefully acknowledged - many thanks to A.
