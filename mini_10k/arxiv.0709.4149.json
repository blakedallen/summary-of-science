As it is well-known, phenomenology imposes all of them to be compactified,\nexcept the four dimensions observed in our universe. The compactification procedure, however, always introduces a certain number of new fields called moduli\nwhose expectation values are related, for example, to the size and the shape of the\ncompact manifold and determine the parameters of the four dimensional effective\n1\n\n\fLagrangian. Without fixing these expectation values, string models are not predictive. A lot of work has been done in the last few years to fix the value of these\nmoduli, but we are left with the problem that there are too many possibilities and\nthere is the feeling among many string theorists that something important is still\nmissing.\nIn general, in order to obtain an N = 1 supersymmetric version of the Standard Model, one needs to compactify the six extra dimensions in a Calabi-Yau\nsix-dimensional space. However, it is not possible, in general, to have an explicit\nformulation of string theory in these backgrounds. Therefore it is not really possible\nto construct explicit extensions of the Standard Model and compare their results\nwith phenomenology. If one wants to do that, then it is necessary to restrict oneself\nto orbifolds and orientifolds of toroidal compactifications.\nStarting from the observation that one wants chiral fermions, as required by the\nStandard Model, string theory models based on intersecting branes have been proposed and extensively studied. In particular, type IIA orientifolds with intersecting\nD6 branes, together with their counterparts in type IIB theory, have provided a\nphenomenologically interesting class of very explicit string compactifications [1\u20134].\nIn these models one only considers the simplest case in which the six-dimensional\ncompact manifold is the product of three two-dimensional tori T 2 \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 T 2 . If,\nfor the sake of simplicity, the analysis is limited to the torus described by the two\ncoordinates x1 and x2 with one stack of D6 branes being placed along the x1 axis\nand a different one at an angle \u03b8 (0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0) in the plane (x1 , x2 ), then one gets\nthe following boundary conditions for an open string having one endpoint attached\nto the first stack of branes and the other endpoint attached to the other stack:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03c3 cos(\u03b8)X 1 \u2212 sin(\u03b8)X 2 \u03c3=0 = 0 ; \u2202\u03c4 sin(\u03b8)X 1 + cos(\u03b8)X 2 \u03c3=0 = 0\n(1)\nand Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions respectively in the 1, 2 directions\nat \u03c3 = \u03c0.\nIf one considers a squared torus with radii R1 and R2 , then the angle \u03b8 is easily\nseen to be given by:\ntan \u03b8 =\n\nmR2\nnR1\n\nwhere (n, m) are the wrapping numbers along the directions 1 and 2 respectively of\nthe second stack of branes. If one performs a T-duality transformation along the\ndirection x2 , that amounts to exchange \u03c3 \u2194 \u03c4 , the boundary conditions in Eq. (1)\nare transformed into the following ones:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03c3 X 1 \u2212 tan \u03c0\u03bd\u2202\u03c4 X 2 \u03c3=0 = 0 ; \u2202\u03c3 X 2 + tan \u03c0\u03bd\u2202\u03c4 X 1 \u03c3=0 = 0\nthat are the boundary conditions for an open string having the endpoint at \u03c3 = 0\nattached to a brane with a constant magnetic field, given by:\ntan \u03c0\u03bd \u2261 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 f12 =\n2\n\nm \u03b1\u2032\n,\nn R1 R2\n\n\f\u2032\n\nwhere tan \u03c0\u03bd is obtained from tan \u03b8 by the T-duality transformation: R2 \u2192 R\u03b12 . In\nthe T-dual theory the integer n multiplies the volume of the T-dual torus, and thus\nit plays the role of the wrapping number of the brane on the whole torus1 .\nBeing the brane compactified on a torus T 2 , the first Chern class for an SU(N)\nnon-abelian gauge field living on it must be an integer, i.e.:\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\nm\u2032\nF\n= 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F12 N = m\u2032 =\u21d2 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F12 =\n(2)\nTr\n2\u03c0\nN\nM\nbeing M the brane worldvolume. It is easily seen that the wrapping number m,\nalong the direction x2 in which the T-duality transformation is performed, becomes\nthe magnetic charge m\u2032 and the wrapping number n along the other direction x1\nbecomes the rank of the gauge group N that is also equal to the wrapping number\non the entire torus T 2 . In conclusion, this analysis suggests that a brane wrapped\nn times along the first cycle of the torus and m times along the second cycle of the\ntorus becomes, under a T-duality performed along the second axis x2 , a magnetized\nbrane with magnetic flux m that is wrapped n times along the whole torus and that\nis described by a non-abelian gauge theory with gauge group U(N) with N = n.\nThe fact that, in order to describe branes wrapped N times on the torus T 2 , one\nneeds a non-abelian gauge theory U(N), has been advocated by many authors [5\u20139].\nIn particular, in Ref. [10], it has been used for computing, among other things, the\nYukawa couplings in the field theory limit (\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0) corresponding to massless open\nstring states attached to magnetized branes. In this approach a D-brane wrapped\nN times along the torus T 2 is described by a U(N) gauge theory just like a stack\nof N D-branes only wrapped once. The difference between the two systems is that\nin the latter case the gauge holonomy is the identity, while it is not trivial in the\nformer. This implies that for N branes wrapped once the gauge theory quantities\nare periodic in going around the two cycles of the torus, while for an N-tuply wound\nD brane one gets instead a gauge bundle whose non gauge invariant quantities are\nperiodic only up to a gauge transformation.\nAt this point a question is natural: do the previous considerations mean that\na brane wrapped N times around the torus T 2 is necessarily described by a gauge\nbundle of a U(N) gauge theory? Instead of trying to answer this question directly,\nlet us observe that, if one uses an abelian rather than a non-abelian field, then the\nfactor N in Eq. (2) could be in principle reproduced in a different way. In fact, in\nthis case, Eq. (2) becomes:\nZ \u0012 \u0013\nF\n= 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F12 N = m\u2032\n(3)\n2\u03c0\nM\n1\n\nThis wrapping number, which we use in the paper, is not the same thing of the geometrical\nembedding since it contains\nA geometrical embedding of a T 2 into a T 2 is\n\u0012 less information.\n\u0013\np j\ncharacterized by a matrix\n, up to SL(2, Z) transformations, which has wrapping n = pq.\n0 q\n\n3\n\n\fwhere now the factor N = n is not obtained from the trace over the non-abelian\ngroup as before, but from\n\u221a 2the fact that the brane worldvolume is N times the\nvolume of the torus (2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 ) , differently from the non-abelian case where the brane\nworldvolume coincides with the torus, as a consequence of the different periodicity\nconditions on the embedding coordinates.\nThis second logical possibility can be realized, for instance, by a particular\nsystem of D-branes that we call Narain branes. These are indeed obtained from\na system of non-magnetized branes by acting with the Narain T-duality group. It\nseems to us that this point of view has been taken in Ref.s [11\u201316]. This was also\nthe point of view taken in Ref.s [17, 18], but with some differences with respect to\nthe previous ones.\nIn this paper we will discuss both points of views and compare them. There is\nalso another reason for our analysis. In fact, while on the side of the intersecting\nbranes a unique and complete string description (up to non geometrical data) is\navailable and amplitudes involving both twisted and untwisted open strings have\nbeen computed, on the side of magnetized branes, instead, only partial tree-level\nstring calculations have been performed and, as far as we can see, a complete\nstring description of magnetized branes is still lacking. For example, in the case\nof the Yukawa couplings, only a part of the amplitude has been computed at treelevel in string theory [4, 19], while the rest has been obtained in the field theory\nlimit [10]. The complete expression of the Yukawa couplings has been obtained\nfrom the corresponding computations in the intersecting branes scenario via Tduality [20\u201322] or from the two-loop twisted partition function [23, 24].\nIn this paper we make the first step toward a more complete string theory\nformulation of magnetized branes on the torus.\nIn particular, on the one hand, we show that, in order to describe wrapped\nbranes, we need to extend the concept of gauge bundle to string theory and in this\nframework we write the equations that characterize the physical states when one\ngoes around the two one-cycles of the torus. We show that in this case the ChanPaton factors, unlike the usual ones describing the non-abelian degrees of freedom,\nare momentum dependent. Then we construct the boundary state corresponding\nto wrapped magnetized branes described by gauge bundles and compute the oneloop partition function. The boundary state is constructed in two different ways.\nThe first consists in factorizing the annulus diagram computed in the open string\nchannel which fixes the boundary state up to a phase factor and the second in\na direct calculation involving the non-abelian Wilson loop. We find agreement\nbetween the two procedures up to a phase factor.\nOn the other hand, following the other logical possibility discussed above for\ndescribing the wrapped branes, we start from a theory with no gauge field and\nwe get a theory with a non-vanishing gauge field by using the general T-duality\ngroup found by Narain. We then apply the same technique based on T-duality for\nconstructing a boundary state with a gauge field on it from the usual boundary\nstate. It turns out that the boundary states determined in the two approaches are\n4\n\n\fnot identical, but give the same one-loop amplitude. The boundary state obtained\nin the gauge bundle scheme contains an extra phase factor that, however, does not\ncontribute to the annulus diagram.\nWe then compute in these two theories disk amplitudes involving both open and\nclosed strings showing that they are different. Hence, if we only focus on the first\nChern class constraint in order to characterize the T-dual of intersecting branes, we\ndo not have yet enough elements for distinguishing which of these two inequivalent\ndescriptions is the right one.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we study open strings in an\narbitrary toroidal background interacting with a magnetic field living on the compactified directions. We introduce the conserved generalized translation operator\nand the notion of gauge bundle.\nIn Sect. 3 we discuss the gauge bundle in string theory as a description of\nwrapped magnetized space-filling branes. We construct the corresponding boundary\nstate, compute the one-loop diagram, and give the open string vertices containing\nthe Chan-Paton factors that are momentum dependent. In this paper we will call\nnon-abelian branes those based on a non-abelian gauge bundle.\nIn Sect. 4 we discuss the Narain branes. In particular, we construct their\nboundary state, that turns out to be equal to that of the non-abelian branes apart\nfrom a phase factor, and their open string vertices. We show that the two kinds of\nbranes, even if they have the same free-energy, are indeed different objects because\nthey have a different boundary state and different scattering amplitudes involving\nboth open and closed strings.\nMany of the calculations are presented in four Appendices. In Appendix A we\nsummarize our conventions. Appendix B is devoted to the solution of the equations\nof motion of open and closed strings in closed and open string backgrounds. In\nAppendix C we discuss the transformations of various quantities under the general Narain group of T-duality and in Appendix D we perform the path-ordering\ncalculation of the boundary state with a background gauge field.\n\n2\n\nOpen strings in flux backgrounds\n\nIn this section we study the effects of turning on a background gauge field living on a\n\u02c6\nd-dimensional\ntorus and interacting with closed string backgrounds. First we review\nthe solution of the equations of motion for open strings (the case of closed strings is\ndiscussed in Appendix B) and then we analyse how the translation generator gets\nmodified when a magnetic field is turned on.\n\n2.1\n\nOpen string in open and closed string background.\n\n\u02c6\nLet us consider open strings on the d-dimensional\ntorus, interacting with constant\ngravitational and Kalb-Ramond backgrounds and with an open string background\n5\n\n\f(0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\nconsisting of two abelian gauge fields with constant field strengths Fij and Fij\nacting at the two end-points \u03c3 = 0, \u03c0 of the string and, in general, independent of\neach other. Such a system is described by the following action 2 :\nS = Sbulk + Sboundary\nwhere Sbulk is given by:\nZ\nZ \u03c0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nSbulk = \u2212\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c3 Gab \u2202\u03b1 X a \u2202\u03b2 X b \u03b7 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 Bab \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 X a \u2202\u03b2 X b\n\u2032\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n0\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nbeing the world-sheet metric \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 = diag(\u22121, 1) and \u01eb01 = 1, while Sboundary is:\nZ\nZ\n(0)\n(\u03c0)\ni\nSboundary = \u2212q0 d\u03c4 Ai \u2202\u03c4 X |\u03c3=0 + q\u03c0 d\u03c4 Ai \u2202\u03c4 X i |\u03c3=\u03c0\nZ\nZ\nq0\nq\u03c0\n(0) j i\n(\u03c0)\n=\nd\u03c4 Fij X \u1e8a |\u03c3=0 \u2212\nd\u03c4 Fij X j \u1e8a i |\u03c3=\u03c0 ; i, j = 1, ..., d\u02c6 (6)\n2\n2\n\nwhere q0 and q\u03c0 are the charges located at the two end-points of the open string.\nIn Eq. (6) we have used the following form for the background gauge fields\n1\nAi = \u2212 Fij xj .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nThe field Ai in Eq. (7) is not a periodic quantity when we go around one of the\ntwo one-cycles of the torus. However, on the torus, gauge non-invariant quantities\nas Ai have only to be periodic up to a gauge transformation [25]:\n\u221a\n1\n\u22121\nAi (xj + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b4lj ) = \u03a9l (x) Ai (xj ) \u03a9\u22121\nl (x) \u2212 i \u03a9l (x) \u2202i \u03a9l (x)\nq\n\n(8)\n\nwhere q is the gauge coupling constant and \u03a9l (x) \u2261 \u03a9l (xj6=l ) is the gauge transition\nfunction. From now we mean by gauge bundle the assignment of a background field,\ntogether with a transition function which fixes the periodicity property of the gauge\nfield. Analogously, matter fields in the adjoint representation have to satisfy the\nperiodicity conditions\n\u221a\n(9)\n\u03a6(xj + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b4lj ) = \u03a9l (x) \u03a6(xj ) \u03a9\u22121\nl (x).\nNotice that, if we perform a gauge transformation\ni\nA\u03c9i (x) = \u03c9(x) Ai (x) \u03c9 \u22121(x) \u2212 \u03c9(x) \u2202i \u03c9 \u22121 (x)\nq\nthe transition functions transform as\n\u221a\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u03a9\u03c9j (x) = \u03c9(x1 , . . . , xj + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 , . . . , xd ) \u03a9j (x) \u03c9 \u22121 (x1 , . . . , xd ).\n2\n\nWith respect to the notation used in [18] we have set q\u03c0 \u2192 \u2212q\u03c0 .\n\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fFurthermore, they also have to satisfy the cocycle condition, which simply means\nthat the gauge fields must be unchanged when translated along a closed path:\n\u221a k\n\u221a\nk\n\u22121 k\n(x\n)\u03a9\n(x\n+\n2\u03c0\n\u03a9j (xk + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b4ik )\u03a9i (xk )\u03a9\u22121\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03b4j ) = IN .\n(11)\nj\ni\nFor the choice of the gauge field given in Eq. (7), the gauge transition functions\nsatisfying the identity in Eq. (8) are\n\u03a9i (x) = e\u2212i\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 qFij xj\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nWith the previous choice the cocycle condition is trivially satisfied because it is\nequivalent to require that the first Chern class is an integer, as we will show shortly.\nThe above considerations can be extended to the case of a U(1) gauge field that\nis included in a U(N) gauge theory. In this case we have a non-abelian gauge bundle\nwhere the gauge transition functions are non-trivial unitary matrices. A possible\nchoice for them is [25]:\n\u03a9j = e\u2212i\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 qFji xi\n\n\u03c9j\n\nwhere we have extracted the U(1) factor from the gauge transition functions. The\ncocycle condition imposes the following constraints on the \u03c9's:\n\u03c9i \u03c9j = e\u2212i2\u03c0qF\u0302ij \u03c9j \u03c9i ;\n\nF\u0302ij \u2261 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 Fij .\n\n(13)\n\nBy taking the determinant of the previous expression it follows that the field\nstrength must satisfy the condition:\nq F\u0302ij N = nij \u2208 Z\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Fij is constant and nij is an integer. Eq. (14) is indeed satisfied because\nit coincides with the first Chern class for a non-abelian gauge field, that must be\nan integer. In the case of an SU(N) gauge group, one can explicitly construct the\nmatrices \u03c9i in terms of the constant 't Hooft matrices PN and QN [25] given in\nAppendix A:\ni = 1, . . . , d\u02c6\n\n\u03c9i \u2261 PNsi QtNi\n\n(15)\n\nwith si and ti suitable integers. Since PN QN = e2\u03c0i/N QN PN , then the cocycle\ncondition written in Eq. (13) can be easily satisfied by choosing:\nnij = si tj \u2212 sj ti .\nwith nij defined in Eq. (14). One could also add Wilson lines and this can be done\nin two different ways: either by adding them as a constant in the expression of the\ngauge field or in the transition functions. We will discuss these two possibilities\nlater on.\n7\n\n\fFrom the action in Eq. (4) one can derive the equations of motion in the bulk\ngiven by:\n\u2202\u03b1 [Gij \u2202 \u03b1 X j ] = 0\n\n(16)\n\nand the two boundary conditions at \u03c3 = 0, \u03c0:\ni\nh\n(0,\u03c0)\nGij \u2202\u03c3 X j + (Bij \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032q0,\u03c0 Fij )\u2202\u03c4 X j\n\n\u03c3=0,\u03c0\n\n= 0.\n\n(17)\n\nThe solution of these equations can be easily found in the simplest case in which\nq0 = q\u03c0 = q\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\nFij = Fij = Fij .\n\nand the following condition holds:\ndet(q0 F (0) \u2212 q\u03c0 F (\u03c0) )ij = 0\ncorresponding to the so-called dipole string. The case in which this determinant is\ndifferent from zero corresponds to the dycharged string.\nIn the dipole case the general solution [26, 27] can be written as (see Appendix\nB.3 for details):\ni\n1h i\ni\ni\nX\u0302L (\u03c4 + \u03c3) + X\u0302R (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)\n(18)\nX (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) =\n2\nwhere the left and right moving parts are given, up to a constant, by:\n\u0001\nX\u0302Li (\u03c4 + \u03c3) = (G\u22121 E)ij XLj (\u03c4 + \u03c3)\n\n(19)\n\nand\n\nX\u0302Ri (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3) = (G\u22121 E T )ij XRj (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3)\n\n\u0001\n\n(20)\n\nE = k Eij k= E T + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032q0 F \u2261 G \u2212 B\n\n(21)\n\nwith E defined by:\n\nbeing\nE = k Eij k= G + B\nand\nX \u03b1i\n\u221a\nn \u2212in(\u03c4 +\u03c3)\nXLi (\u03c4 + \u03c3) = xi + 2\u03b1\u2032 G ij pj (\u03c4 + \u03c3) + i 2\u03b1\u2032\ne\nn\nn6=0\n\nX \u03b1i\n\u221a\nn \u2212in(\u03c4 \u2212\u03c3)\ne\nXRi (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3) = xi + 2\u03b1\u2032 G ij pj (\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3) + i 2\u03b1\u2032\nn\nn6=0\n8\n\n\fwhere Gij is the open string metric:\nG \u2261 E T G\u22121 E\nand G ij is its inverse. The quantization of the theory requires the following commutation relations [26\u201328]:\n[xi , xj ] = i 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 \u0398ij\n\n[xi , pj ] = iG ij\n\ni\n[\u03b1m\n, \u03b1nj ] = G ij m\u03b4n+m,0\n\nwhere \u0398 is defined by the relation:\n(E \u22121)ij = G ij \u2212 \u0398ij .\n\n(22)\n\nThe operator L0 is given by the Hamiltonian in Eq.

(7) and is not\na conserved charge as in the case with F = 0. This is not surprising because the\nstring action, in the presence of a magnetic field, is not invariant under translations.\nHowever, one can easily see that the string action is indeed invariant under a suitable\ncombination of a translation and a gauge transformation [29] . In particular, with\nthe gauge chosen in Eq. (7), the action is invariant under the combination of\na translation X i \u2192 X i + \u01ebi (under which the gauge field transforms as Ai \u2192\nAi + \u2202j Ai \u01ebj ) and a gauge transformation Ai \u2192 Ai \u2212 \u2202i \u03c6 with \u03c6 = 21 Fij X j \u01ebi . We\nwill refer to this transformation as a generalized translation. The N\u00f6ether current\nassociated to such an invariance is given by:\nJi\u03b1 (\u03c4, \u03c3) = \u2212\n\n1\n[Gij \u2202 \u03b1 X j \u2212 Bij \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 X j ]\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nwhich is conserved as a consequence of the equations of motion.\n\n9\n\n\fThe conservation of the previous current implies [30]:\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u03c0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1\n0 =\nd\u03c3\u2202\u03b1 Ji =\nd\u03c3 \u2202\u03c4 Ji0 (\u03c3) + Ji1 (\u03c3)|\u03c3=\u03c0 \u2212 Ji1 (\u03c3)|\u03c3=0 =\n0\n0\n\u0015\n\u0014Z \u03c0\n1\n(0) j\n(\u03c0) j\nj\nj\u2032\n[Gij \u1e8a + Bij X ] + q0 Fij X |\u03c3=0 \u2212 q\u03c0 Fij X |\u03c3=\u03c0\n= \u2202\u03c4\nd\u03c3\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n0\nwhere we have used the open string boundary conditions given in Eq.s (17). It\nfollows that the generator of such a transformation is a constant of the motion that\nis simply given by [29, 30]:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ \u03c0\n1\n(0)\n(\u03c0)\nj\nj\u2032\nj\nj\nT\u0302i =\nd\u03c3\n[Gij \u1e8a + Bij X ] + q0 Fij X \u03b4(\u03c3) \u2212 q\u03c0 Fij X \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c0)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n0\n= (q0 F (0) \u2212 q\u03c0 F (\u03c0) )ij xj + \u03b4q0 F (0) \u2212q\u03c0 F (\u03c0) ;0 Gij pj .\n\n(24)\n\nIt differs from the conjugate momentum for the one half factor in front of the\nterms depending on the gauge field.

In\nthe next section we will generalize the previous construction to the case of D-branes\nwrapped N times.\n\n3\n\nNon-abelian branes\n\nIn this section we provide a description of D-branes wrapped N times along the\ntwo-cycles of the torus T 2 . We start discussing in sect. 3.1 the case with vanishing\ngauge field that has been already discussed in the literature and then we analyze\nin sect. 3.2 the case with F 6= 0. We show that, in this description, D-branes\nwrapped N times along the torus T 2 have Chan-Paton factors that are momentum\ndependent. Then in sect. 3.3 we discuss the non-degenerate case and in sect. 3.4 the\ndegenerate one. Sect. 3.5 is devoted to the construction of the boundary state and\nto the one-loop annulus diagram. Finally the open tachyon vertex is constructed in\nsect. 3.6.\n\n3.1\n\nNon-abelian gauge bundle: F = 0\n\nLet us start discussing the case with F = 0, but with A having a non trivial\nbackground value or, equivalently, when a Wilson line background is turned on.\nThis is the case considered in Ref. [8] where the perturbative dynamics of open\nstrings attached to multiply wound D-branes is analyzed. A very important point\nmade in Ref. [8] is that a D-brane wrapped N times around a torus can be described\nas a brane with gauge group U(N) and with a non trivial holonomy group H =\n6\nI. Actually, as stressed in Ref. [31], the existence of a non-trivial holonomy is\nwhat makes the difference between a bound state of N D-branes each wrapped\nonce around the torus (such a state has gauge group U(N) but trivial holonomy\nH = I) and a single N-tuply wound D-brane. On the other hand, a non-trivial\ngauge Hholonomy H arises when a Wilson line background is turned on, being H =\nP [e\u2212iq A ] and P stands for the path ordering. Thus Wilson lines provide a natural\n11\n\n\fway to describe multiply wound D-branes. However, as discussed in Ref. [8], a\nWilson line background implies non standard kinetic terms for the fields. Therefore\nit is useful to make a field redefinition which actually exchanges the Wilson line\nbackground with non-trivial boundary conditions. More explicitly, let us consider\nthe following U(N) Wilson lines background:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na1i . . . 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nAi = \u0398i = \uf8ed 0 . . .\n\uf8f8.\nN\n0 . . . ai\nIt implies the existence of a non-trivial holonomy group:\nH = P [e\u2212iq\n\nH\n\nA\n\n] = e\u2212iq2\u03c0\u0398i\n\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nBeing the gauge field background Ai constant, the periodicity condition in Eq. (8)\nis simply satisfied by the gauge transition function \u03a9l = IN , which means that both\nthe gauge and the matter fields have trivial boundary conditions:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03a6(xj + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b4lj ) = \u03a6(xj ).\n(31)\nAi (xj + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03b4lj ) = Ai (xj )\nHowever, the non-zero value of the background field A generates non-standard kinetic terms. It is therefore useful to perform a gauge transformation with the gauge\ni\n\u02c6\nfunction \u03c9(x1 , . . . , xd ) = e\u2212iq\u0398i x so, according to Eq. (10), one gets:\nA\u03c9i = 0\n\n\u03a9\u03c9i = e\u2212iq2\u03c0\u0398i\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(32)\n\ncorresponding to a new description in which the Wilson line background is zero,\nbut the gauge and matter fields satisfy the non-trivial boundary conditions given in\nEq.s (8), (9) with \u03a9 given in (32). Notice that the transition function in Eq. (32)\ncoincides with the holonomy matrix in Eq. (30).\n\n3.2\n\nNon-abelian gauge bundle in string theory: F 6= 0\n\nIn this subsection we discuss the case F 6= 0 and extend the notion of gauge bundle,\ndiscussed in sect. 2.1, to the string level in the non-abelian case. The main difference\nwhich occurs in the F 6= 0 case is that, by choosing for example the gauge field as\nin Eq. (7), the gauge transition functions are\u221aforced to be non trivial, because Ai\nitself is not single valued under xi \u2192 xi + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 . In other words with F 6= 0 one\nis forced to have non trivial holonomy.\nLet us first go back to the abelian case describing a D brane only wrapped once\non the torus T 2 . The basic ingredient is the identification of the physical states\nunder combined translations and gauge transformations as expressed in Eq. (28).\nIn addition we have also to impose the consistency condition which requires the\n\n12\n\n\fstring states to be left invariant when translated along a closed path. This means\nthat:\n(j)\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\n(i)\n\nT2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 T2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 |phys.i = T2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 T2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 |phys.i\n\n(33)\n\nh\ni\n(i)\n(j)\nT2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 , T2\u03c0\u221a\u03b1\u2032 = 0.\n\n(34)\n\nor equivalently:\n\nEq. (34) can be considered as the extension to the string level of the cocycle\ncondition given in Eq. (11). In the abelian case the constraint in Eq. (34) is always\nverified. In particular, when the dipole condition holds, it is satisfied because the\ntranslation generators commute, as it follows from Eq. (25). In the dycharged\nstring case, the right hand side of Eq. (25) is not vanishing anymore and Eq. (34)\nimposes the following constraint:\n\u221a\n(0)\n(\u03c0)\n(35)\n(2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 )2 (q0 F (0) \u2212 q\u03c0 F (\u03c0) )ij = 2\u03c0(nij \u2212 nij ) nij \u2208 Z\nwhich is indeed satisfied because this is nothing but the definition of the first Chern\nclass for a constant field strength. This is another evidence that T is the right\ntranslation operator.\nThe previous analysis is valid in the abelian case in which we have just two\nbranes wrapped once on the torus with two different U(1) background gauge fields\nturned-on on their worldvolume. But if we want to describe two stacks of D-branes\nwrapped respectively N0 and N\u03c0 times on the torus, we need to extend the previous\nconsiderations to a non-abelian case where the string states are dressed with ChanPaton factors. The gauge group is U(N0 ) \u00d7 U(N\u03c0 ). In this case the generator of\n(0,\u03c0)\ngeneralized translations acts also on the Chan-Paton factors. We denote by \u03c9i\nthe matrices acting on them. Physical states must then satisfy the identification\ne2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 iT\u0302i\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03c0) \u2020\n\n(\u03c9i )lh (\u03c9i\n\n)tm |\u03a6, h ti \u2261 |\u03a6, l mi,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere the background gauge field has been taken in the U(1) part of the gauge\ngroup. Moreover the following cocycle condition has to be satisfied:\ne(2\u03c0\n= e(2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 )iT\u0302j (2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 )iT\u0302i\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 )iT\u0302i (2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 )iT\u0302j\n\ne\n\ne\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c9i \u03c9j )lh (\u03c9i \u03c9j )\u2020tm |\u03a6, h ti\n\n(\u03c9j \u03c9i )lh (\u03c9j \u03c9i )\u2020tm |\u03a6, h ti.\n\n(37)\n\nThis equation is satisfied if we impose the relations:\n(0)\n\u03c9i\n\n(0)\n\u03c9j\n\n\u22122\u03c0i\n\n=e\n\n(0)\nn\nij\nN0\n\n(0)\n\u03c9j\n\n(0)\n\u03c9i\n\n;\n\n(\u03c0)\n\u03c9i\n\n(\u03c0)\n\u03c9j\n\n\u22122\u03c0i\n\n=e\n\n(\u03c0)\nn\nij\nN\u03c0\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n\u03c9j \u03c9i .\n\n(38)\n\nEq. (38) is the string realization of the constraint given in Eq. (13) and again it\ncan be satisfied by taking for the \u03c9's the matrices in Eq. (15).\n13\n\n\fEq. (36) can also be written in the following suggestive form:\ne2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 iT\u0302i\n\n(\u03c0) \u2020\n\n(0)\n\n[(\u03c9i )\u039b(\u03c9i\n\n)]lm lim V (z)|0i \u2261 \u039blm lim V (z)|0i\nz\u21920\n\nz\u21920\n\nwhere V (z) is the vertex operator which creates the corresponding physical state by\nacting on the conformal vacuum and the matrix \u039b is the Chan-Paton factor. The\nprevious equation implies the important relation:\ne2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 iT\u0302i\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c9i \u039bV (z)(e2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 iT\u0302i\n\n(\u03c0)\n\n\u03c9i )\u2020 \u2261 \u039bV (z)\n\n(39)\n\nwhich must be satisfied by the open string vertex V (z). In deriving Eq. (39) we\nhave assumed that the generators of generalized translation annihilate the vacuum:\nT\u0302i |0i = 0.\nIn the last part of this section we will analyze more explicitly the case of a\nconstant background gauge field satisfying the dipole condition and living in the\nidentity part of the U(N) gauge group. It follows that the first Chern class is given\nby:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nq F12 IN\n= 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032q F12 N = n12 \u2261 f \u2208 Z\n(40)\nTr\n2\u03c0\n\u221a\nR\nwhere we have used the fact that d2 x = (2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 )2 . In this set-up the cocycle\ncondition given in Eq. (38) can be easily satisfied by taking:\n\u03c92 = PNf .\n\n\u03c91 = QN\n\n(41)\n\nIn general, the Chan-Paton factor \u039b depends on the choice of transition functions.\nWith the previous choice, Eq. (36) gives the following constraints:\ne2\u03c0\ne2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 ip1\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 ip2\n\nQN \u039bk Q\u2020N |\u03a6, ki \u2261 \u039bk |\u03a6, ki\n\nPNf \u039bk PN\u2212f |\u03a6, ki \u2261 \u039bk |\u03a6, ki\n\n(42)\n\nwhere we have denoted by k the momentum of the physical state and, as it will be\nclear later, we have also assumed a dependence of the Chan-Paton factors on the\nmomentum k.\nIt is useful to expand the Chan-Paton factors in terms of the complete set of 't\nHooft matrices:\n(\u039bk )lm =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nC(k, hi ) QhN2 PNh1\n\nh1 , h2 =0\n\n\u0001\n\nlm\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\nWe will see in the next subsections that Eq.s (42) fix the structure of the ChanPaton factors up to a c-number. When discussing the string vertices, we will explicitly show that a phase factor is indeed necessary to ensure the correct hermitian\nconjugation property of the string vertex.\nIn the following we are going to treat separately the degenerate case and the nondegenerate one, where the great common divisor (GCD) between the first Chern\nclass and the rank of the gauge group is greater or equal to one, respectively.\n14\n\n\fThe non-degenerate case: GCD(f, N ) = 1\n\n3.3\n\n\u221a\nIn this case, by translating of 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 the string states N times along the i-th direction of the torus, Eq.s (42) reduce to the identity:\ne2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 i N pi\n\n\u039bk |\u03a6, ki \u2261 \u039bk |\u03a6, ki\n\nwhere we have used PNN = QN\nN = 1, giving the following quantization of the momenta:\nni\nni \u2208 Z and i = 1, 2.\n(44)\nki = \u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 N\nEq. (44), when used in the first of Eq.s (42), yields the following constraint on the\nChan-Paton factors in Eq. (43):\n2i\u03c0n1 /N\n\ne\n\nQN \u039b(n1 , n2 ) Q\u22121\nN\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n2i\u03c0n1 /N\n\n= e\n\ne\u22122i\u03c0h1 /N C(n1 , n2 , h1 , h2 ) QhN2 PNh1\n\nh1 , h2 =0\n\n\u2261\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nC(n1 , n2 , h1 , h2 ) QhN2 PNh1\n\n(45)\n\nh1 , h2 =0\n\nafter having used Eq. (99) h1 times in the first equality. Eq. (45) implies\n[N ]\n\nC(n1 ,n2 ,h1,h2 ) = \u03b4n1 ,h1 C(n1 ,n2 ) .\nBy using instead Eq. (42) along the direction x2 one gets:\n2i\u03c0n2 /N\n\ne\n\nPNf \u039b(n1 ,n2 ) PN\u2212f\n\n2i\u03c0n2 /N\n\n= e\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\ne2i\u03c0 f h2 /N C(n1 ,n2 ,h1, h2 ) QhN2 PNh1\n\nh1 , h2 =0\n\n\u2261\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nC(n1 ,n2 ,h1 , h2 ) QhN2 PNh1\n\n(46)\n\nh1 , h2 =0\n\nwhich implies that all the quantities C(ni ,hi ) vanish unless\nf h2 \u2261 \u2212n2\n\nmod N.\n\n(47)\n\nBut, since QN\nN = 1, h2 is actually defined modulo N. Hence we can solve Eq. (47)\nas\nh2 = \u01252 n2\nwhere we have defined the constant \u01252 as\nf \u01252 \u2261 \u22121 mod N\n15\n\n0 \u2264 \u01252 < N\n\n(48)\n\n\fin such a way that for any n2 there is only one value of h2 (modulo N). In conclusion,\nthe periodicity in x1 and x2 implies for C the following form:\n[N ]\n\n[N ]\nC(n1 ,n2 )\n2 ,\u01252 n2\n\nC(n1 ,n2 ,h1,h2 ) = \u03b4h1 ,n1 \u03b4h\n\n(49)\n\nFurthermore, Eq. (49) implies that, for any value of n1 and n2 , we have just one\nvalue of h1 and one of \u01252 modulo N that allow to satisfy the periodicity in the two\ndirections x1 and x2 . This means that, for each value of the two integers (n1 , n2 ) we\nhave a definite value for the integers (h1 , h2 ) modulo N and this selects therefore\na unique matrix (QhN2 PNh1 )ab in the expansion in Eq. (43). Thus the Chan Paton\nfactors explicitly depend on the momentum.\n\nThe degenerate case: g = GCD(f, N ) > 1\n\n3.4\n\nIn this case we have that the periodicity conditions \u03c9iN = 1 are modified as follows:\nN\n\n(\u03c91 )N = (\u03c92 ) g = 1\nand therefore the momenta become:\nn2 g\nk2 = \u221a\n.\n\u03b1\u2032 N\n\nn1\nk1 = \u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 N\n\nBy repeating the same procedure as in the non-degenerate case, we have that the\ncondition written in Eq. (45) is unchanged, while Eq. (46) is modified as follows:\n2i\u03c0n2 g/N\n\ne\n\n\u2212f\nPNf \u039b(n1 ,n2 ) PW\n\n2i\u03c0n2 g/N\n\n= e\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nC(n1 ,n2 ,h1,h2 ) e2i\u03c0f h2 /N QhN2 PNh1\n\nh1 ,h2 =0\n\n\u2261\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nC(n1 ,n2 ,h1,h2 ,hi ) QhN2 PNh1 .\n\nh1 ,h2 =0\n\nThe following condition is implied:\nf\nh2 \u2261 \u2212n2\ng\n\nmod\n\nN\n.\ng\n\n(50)\n\nThe solution of this equation can be found by writing again:\nh2 = \u01252 n2\n\nwith 0 \u2264 \u01252 < N/g\n\nand solving the following condition which is independent on n2 :\nf\n\u01252 \u2261 \u22121\ng\n\nmod\n\n16\n\nN\n.\ng\n\n(51)\n\n\fFinally, we can write:\n\u01252 n2 +m N\ng\n\n\u039b(n1 ,n2 ) \u2261 C(n1 , n2 ,n1 ,\u01252 n2 ) QN\n\nPNn1\n\n(52)\n\nwith m \u2208 Z. However, Eq. (52) immediately shows that we are loosing some\nsolutions. This is because, due to the periodicity of the matrix QN which is N and\nnot N/g, in varying m in the interval 0\u221a\u2264 m < g we have inequivalent solutions\nassociated to the same momentum n2 / \u03b1\u2032 N. This is an extra degeneracy, not\npresent in the non-degenerate case, which leads us to write, instead of Eq.s (51)\nand (52), the following most general solutions:\nN\nh2 = \u01252 n2 + A\n0\u2264A<g\ng\nand\n[N ]\n\n[N ]\nC(n1 , n2 , A)\nn2\n2 ,\u01252 g +AN/g\n\nC(n1 ,n\u03022 ,h1 ,h2) = \u03b4h1 ,n1 \u03b4h\n\n;\n\n0 \u2264 A < g.\n\nHence, given n1 , we have only one value of h1 = n1 contributing in the expansion\nin Eq. (43), while, given n2 , we have g possible values of h2 . This means that each\nvalue of momentum has a degeneracy g.\nIn the last part of this section we make some comments on the generalization\nof the previous bundle construction to the case of magnetized branes living on a\n\u02c6\nproduct of T 2 \u00d7 T 2 * * * \u00d7 T 2 of d2 tori. The gauge bundle is again U(N), but now\nQd/2\n\u02c6\nit is broken into the product l=1 U(Nl ) by the presence, in each factorized torus,\n(l)\n\u02c6\nof a background gauge field with constant field strength F12 , with l = 1, . . . , d/2.\nThe cocycle conditions, given in Eq. (38), can indeed be satisfied by embedding, as\nin the T 2 case, the background gauge fields in the abelian parts of the gauge tran\u02c6 constant\nsition functions and choosing for the non-abelian part the product of d/2\nmatrices, all equal to the ones given in Eq. (41). This choice of gauge bundle allows\nus to trivially generalize the previous analysis to the product of T 2 \u00d7 T 2 . . . T 2 by\nsimply adopting in each T 2 the procedure developed before. An interesting open\nquestion is to understand how general this choice is. It seems indeed to be consistent when the second Chern numbers are integers [25]. However it would be nice\nto find general rules in constructing consistent gauge bundles associated to branes\n\u02c6\ncompactified on a generic torus T d . We leave this analysis to further developments.\n\n3.5\n\nBoundary state of a non-abelian brane\n\nIn this subsection we derive the boundary state of a space-filling D25 brane of the\nbosonic string theory, whose worldvolume spatial dimensions are partially or totally\n\u02c6\ncompactified on a torus T d . The part of the boundary state containing the nonzero modes is the same as in the uncompactified case. Therefore we need only to\ndetermine the part with the zero modes. 3 . Our results can also be easily extended\n3\n\nIn the final writing of this paper we were informed by D. Duo, R. Russo and S. Sciuto that\nthey have obtained a similar expression for the boundary state [24].\n\n17\n\n\fto the case of the D9 brane of a superstring, because the zero mode structure is the\nsame in the two cases.\nThe starting point is the computation of the annulus diagram in the open string\nchannel and this will allow us to make contact with previous results [17, 18, 32].\nIn this calculation the role played by the bundle at string level, developed in the\nprevious subsections, will be very important. Then, by using open/closed string\nduality, we rewrite it in the closed channel and from it we derive the boundary\nstate. Subsequently, the same boundary will be determined directly in the closed\nstring channel along the lines of Ref. [33]. The two approaches provide the same\nboundary state up to a phase that, however, does not contribute to the annulus\ndiagram.\nIn order to use all the machinery developed in the previous sections we restrict\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nourselves to the background R1,25\u2212d \u00d7(T 2 )d/2 (d\u02c6 even). This simplification, however,\nwill not be necessary for determining the boundary state directly from the closed\nstring channel. On each of the tori we turn on a background gauge field with\nconstant field strength given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nl\n0\nF12\nI Nl .\nFl \u2261\nl\n\u2212F12\n0\nLet us start by computing the annulus diagram in the open string channel in the\ncase in which the open strings are attached to two space-filling branes having the\nsame gauge field on their worldvolume and therefore satisfying the dipole condition.\nThis amounts to evaluate:\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c4 \u0002 \u22122\u03c0\u03c4 L0 \u0003\ndipole\n2\nTr e\n(53)\nZ25; F = M\n\u03c4\n0\n\nwhere, in order to be more general, we have considered M space-filling branes\nproducing the factor M 2 in the previous equation. These are degrees of freedom\nassociated to an additional U(M) gauge group under which the background gauge\nfields are uncharged. L0 is the open string Hamiltonian given in Eq. (29).

(55) gives the interaction between two stacks of M D25 magnetized branes in\nthe closed channel. By using the equation:\ndipole\nZ25;\nF = hD25(E, F )|\u2206|D25(E, F )i\n\nwhere \u2206 is the closed string propagator, we can determine the boundary state apart\nfrom an overall phase.\nIn this way we get the following expression of the boundary state, which we now\nwrite both for the D25 brane of the bosonic theory and for the D9 brane of the\nsuperstring:\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n1\nTd\u22121 \u2212 P\u221e\ndet E\n\u03bd\nM\ne n=1 n \u03b1\u2212n G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b1\u0303\u2212n\n|D(d \u2212 1)(E, F )i =\n1/4\n(detG)\n2\n\u02c6\n\n\u00d7 e\u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\nn=1 n\n\n\u03b1i\u2212n Eik (E \u2212T )kh Ghj \u03b1\u0303j\u2212n\n\n|k = 0; 0a , 0\u00e3 i\n\nd/2\nY\nl=1\n\n|D(d \u2212 1)(E, F )lNl iz.m. .

(21). Notice that the particular structure of the delta\nfunction is the one that is also required by the overlap conditions in Eq. (124).\nFinally, in order to reproduce the peculiar structure of the exponent in Eq. (55)\nand also to implement that the first Chern-class is integer as dictated by Eq. (40),\nwe have to impose that mq(l) = Nl sq(l) with sq(l) \u2208 Z and we end with the following\nboundary state:\nX\nl\n|D(d \u2212 1)(E, F )lNl iz.m. = Nl\n|2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032Nl qFpq\nsq(l) , Nl sq(l) i\n(58)\ns(l) \u2208Z\n\nBefore discussing the degenerate case let us compare the boundary state in Eq. (58)\nwith the one we have exhibited in Eq. (17) of Ref. [18]. They only differ from the\n19\n\n\ffact that the zero modes in Eq.s (57) and (58) have integer Kaluza-Klein momenta\nand winding numbers, while the ones in Eq. (17) of Ref.

We think, however, that it is unnatural\nto have fractional Kaluza-Klein momenta in the closed string sector and therefore\nwe prefer the boundary state given here which eliminates this feature.\nThe previous equations can be easily generalized to the degenerate case.

(61) reproduces the zero-mode\ncontribution in Eq. (60). Notice that the asymmetry between directions 1 and 2 is\n20\n\n\fa direct consequence of the asymmetric choice for the transition function performed\nin Eq. (41).\nIn the following we would like to explore the connection between the magnetized\nD25 branes carrying non-trivial gauge bundles and the T-dual systems corresponding to lower dimensional branes generically wrapping some cycles of the torus. The\n(l)\nT-duality which we consider is the one that exchanges the K\u00e4hler structures Ti\n(l)\nwith the complex structures Ui of the torus T 2 defined as follows:\n\u221a\n(l)\n\u221a\nG\nG(l)\n(l)\n(l)\n(l)\n(l)\n(l)\n+\ni\n.\nT (l) \u2261 T1 + iT2 = B12 + i G(l) ; U (l) \u2261 U1 + iU2 = 12\n(l)\n(l)\nG11\nG11\nThe exponential factor in Eq. (59), which is essentially due to the zero modes of\nthe open string Hamiltonian 4 on the torus T 2 , can be written as:\n!\n!\n(l)\n(l)\n(l)\n(l) (l) q\n(l) |n(l) \u2212 n(l) U |2\n(l) q\n(l)\nnp \u03b41p + np g (l) \u03b42p\n+\nn\ng\n\u03b4\nT\nn\n\u03b4\n2\n1\nq\nq\ng\n2\n1\n(62)\n(G (l) )pq\n= 2(l) N\nl\nNl\nNl\nU2 | (l)l T \u2212 f(l) |2\ng\n\ng\n\nwhere we have used the open string metric on the torus T 2 :\n!\n(l)\n(l)\nT2\n|U (l) |2 \u2212U1\n(l) pq\n(G ) =\n; B = B12 \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 qF12 .\n(l)\n2\n(l)\n(l) 2\n\u2212U1\n1\n+ B(l) )\nU (T\n2\n\n2\n\nUnder the T-duality transformation, i.e. T \u2194 U, the l.h.s. of Eq.

The T-dual zero mode Hamiltonian in the non-degenerate case can be interpreted\nas the one of a lower dimensional brane wrapping respectively (\u00b1Nl , \u2213f l ) times\nthe two one-cycles of the torus as we have discussed in the introduction. This can\nbe seen by comparing the zero-mode Hamiltonian in the r.h.s. of Eq. (63) for\n2\n), with the zero-mode\nthe squared torus T 2 with B12 = 0 (T = i R1\u03b1R\u2032 2 ; U = i R\nR1\nHamiltonian given for instance in Sect. (3.1) of Ref. [34].\n(l)\nIn the degenerate case we see instead that, for v1 = 0, the open string Hamiltonian coincides with the one of a lower-dimensional brane with wrappings nl =\n(l)\n\u00b1Nl /g (l) , ml = \u2213f l /g (l) along the one-cycles of the torus. For v1 6= 0, Eq. (63)\nshows that also for zero winding w1l = 0 the open string has a minimal length\nand therefore the previous Hamiltonian describes the interaction between parallel\n4\n\nIn the non-degenerate case and in the case of a squared torus this Hamiltonian appears in\nRef.s [11\u201313]\n\n21\n\n\fbranes displaced in the space transverse to their worldvolume 5 . In this case, the\nzero-mode contribution to the D-brane interaction, in the T-dual configuration, can\nbe written as:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n(l)\n)T (l) |2\n(l) |k(l) \u2212(w(l) + v\n\u02c6\n(l)\nU\nd/2\ng (l) \u22121\ng\nY\uf8ef\nX\nX \u22122\u03c0\u03c4 2(l)\n|nl U +ml |2\n\uf8fa\n(l)\nT\n2\nZz.m. =\ne\n\uf8fb.\n\uf8f0g\nl=1\n\n(k (l) , w (l) )\u2208Z v(l) =0\n\nwhere the sum over v (l) suggests that the brane is not stable and decays into a stack\nof g (l) branes wrapped ml \u2261 \u2213f l /g (l) and nl \u2261 \u00b1Nl /g (l) times along the cycles of\nthe tori (T 2 )(l) 6 .\nIn the last part of this subsection we derive the boundary state with a gauge field\non it directly in the closed string channel starting from the boundary state without\na gauge field and following the procedure described in Ref. [33] that provides the\nfollowing expression:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nH\n|D25(E, F )i = T r P e\u2212i qA |D25(E, F = 0)i\n\nwhere the boundary state without the gauge field is given in Eq.s (128) and (129).\nThe previous path ordering is explicitly evaluated in Appendix D getting\n\u221a\nT25\ndet E X \u2212i\u03c0F\u0302ij< si sj\n|D25(E, F )i =\nN\ne\n|ni = F\u0302ij Nsj , mi = si i\n2\n(det G)1/4 s\n\u00d7 e\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00d7 e\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\nn=1 n\n\nP\u221e\n\n1\nn=1 n\n\n\u03b1i\u2212n Eik (E \u2212T )kh Ghj \u03b1\u0303j\u2212n\n\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03bc\n\u2212n G\u03bc\u03bd \u03b1\u0303\u2212n\n\n|k = 0i.\n\n|0a , 0\u00e3 i\n\n(64)\n\nHere F\u0302ij< = F\u0302 ij when i < j and zero otherwise. The boundary state in Eq. (64)\ndiffers from the one given in Eq. (58) for a phase factor. However, this extra phase\ndoes not give any contribution to the one-loop free-energy and this is the reason\nwhy in the previous determination of the boundary it has not been possible to reveal\nits presence.\n\n3.6\n\nThe string vertices\n\nIn this section we construct the vertex operators corresponding to the open strings\nhaving their endpoints on the D25 branes. We limit our analysis to the compactified part of the vertex and also to the lowest state, the tachyonic one, being the\ngeneralization to higher state vertices straightforward.\nIn the non-degenerate case and on the simplest case of T 2 , the compact part of\nthe string vertex, describing an open-string tachyon living on a non-abelian brane\nis given by:\nV (x; k) = eiki X\n5\n6\n\ni (x)\n\nSee for instance sect. (3.2) of Ref. [34].\nSee the discussion on page 84 of Ref. [4].\n\n22\n\n\u039b(k1 ,k2 )\n\n\fwhere X i (x) is given in Eq. (18) with \u03c3 = 0 and x = e\u2212i\u03c4 , \u039b is the Chan-Paton\nfactor and the momentum is given by\n1 n1 n2\n(k1 , k2 ) = \u221a ( , ).\n\u03b1\u2032 N N\nUsing Eq. (147) it is easy to rewrite the previous equation as follows:\ni\n\nV (x; k) = eiki XL(0) (x) \u039b(k1 ,k2 )\n\n(65)\n\nwhere we have neglected cocycle factors, an example of which is provided for instance by the last term in Eq. (143). The generalization of such a vertex to the\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\ncase of (T 2 )d/2 is simply the factorized product of d2 operators, one for each torus\nT 2 , with the same structure as the one given in Eq. (65).\nIn sections (3.3) and (3.4) we have determined the structure of the Chan-Paton\nfactors, respectively in the non-degenerate and degenerate case, up to a c-number\nfactor. In particular, for the non-degenerate case, the Chan-Paton factor is given\nin Eq. (43) together with Eq. (49). Since now the Chan-Paton factor depends on\nthe momentum, we must also remember that the vertex operator in Eq. (65) has\nto satisfy the hermitian conjugation property\nV (z; k)\u2020 =\n\n1\nV (1/z; \u2212k)\nz 2h\n\nwith h being the conformal weight, which imposes the following constraint on the\nChan-Paton factor:\n\u039b\u2020(k1 ,k2 ) = \u039b(\u2212k1 ,\u2212k2 ) .\n\n(66)\n\nIn order to satisfy the previous identity we must add a phase factor to the ChanPaton factor determined above and we get:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032 \u01252 k2 N \u03b1\u2032 k1\nP\n\u039b(k1 ,k2 ) = \u221a ei\u03c0N \u03b1 \u01252 k1 k2 QN\n(67)\nN\nN\nN\nwhere \u01252 is defined in Eq. (48). The fact that \u039b in Eq. (67) satisfies Eq. (66) is a\nconsequence of the relations: P \u2020 = P \u22121 and Q\u2020 = Q\u22121 .\nIt is easy to check that the \u039b(k1 , k2 ) matrix satisfies the multiplication rule\n1\n\u039b(k1 ,k2 )ac \u039b(l1 ,l2 )cb = \u221a eik\u2227l \u039b(k1 +l1 ,k2 +k2 )ab\nN\nwhere we have introduced the product\nk \u2227 l = \u03c0\u03b1\u2032 N \u01252 (k1 l2 \u2212 k2 l1 )\n23\n\n\for more in general:\nM\nY\n\n\u039b(k(i) ,k(i) ) = N\n\ni=1\n\n1\n\nM\nY\n\n1\u2212M\n2\n\n2\n\neik\n\n(i) \u2227k (j)\n\n\u039b(PM\n\ni=1\n\ni<j=1\n\n(i)\n\nk1 ,\n\nPM\n\ni=1\n\n(i)\n\nk2 )\n\n.\n\nIn order to compare with an alternative description of wrapped branes that we will\npresent in sect. 4, it is useful to evaluate explicitly the trace over the Chan Paton\nfactors, that is given by:\n#\n\"M\nM\nY\nY\nPM\n(i) (j)\n(i)\n(j)\n\u2032\n\u2212M\n2\nTr\n\u039b(k(i) ,k(i) ) = N\neik \u2227k ei\u03c0N \u03b1 \u01252 i,j=1 k1 k2\ni=1\n\n1\n\n2\n\ni<j=1\n\n\u00d7\n\n[N ]\n[N ]\n\u03b4 \u221a \u2032 PM (i) \u03b4 \u221a \u2032 PM (i)\nN \u03b1\ni=1 k1 ;0 N \u03b1\ni=1 k2 ;0\n\n(68)\n\nThe normalization coefficient \u221a1N introduced in Eq. (67) is there to ensure that the\ntrace over two Chan-Paton factors is independent on the number of colors.\nThe analysis done so far to determine the structure of the string vertices in the\nnon-degenerate case can be easily extended to the degenerate case. One gets again\nthe vertex\ni\n\nV (x; k, A) = eiki XL(0) (x) \u039b(k1 ,k2 ),A\nwhere the momentum is given by:\n1\n(k1 , k2 ) = \u221a\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\nn1 n2\n,\nN N/g\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nBy analogy with Eq.

They are described by gauge bundles.\nHowever, as we have pointed out in the introduction, this is not necessarily the\nunique way of describing wrapped magnetized space-filling branes and in this section\nwe discuss another kind of space-filling branes, the Narain branes. Their name is due\nto the fact that they can be obtained from the usual branes without a background\n\u02c6 Z)\ngauge field by means of a transformation of the Narain T-duality group O(d\u0302, d,\nwhich is reviewed in Appendix C. We construct the boundary state corresponding\nto this kind of branes and show that it is coincident (up to a phase which does not\ncontribute to the one-loop vacuum amplitude) with the one already constructed\nin the previous section for the gauge bundles. Then we add Wilson lines to this\nboundary state in the case F = 0 in order to describe a D-brane wrapped N times\naround a torus and analyze their transformation properties under the Narain group,\nand then generalize to the case F 6= 0. We give the vertex operators for the open\nstrings having their endpoints attached to the Narain branes, showing that their\nscattering amplitudes with closed strings are different from those that one derives\nfrom the gauge bundles. In all the examples we will explicitly refer to the tachyon\nvertex because it encodes the main features of the problem, the generalization to\nall other vertices being straightforward.\n\n4.1\n\nNarain branes from plain brane: general case.\n\nIn this section we consider the bosonic string, taking as our starting point a D25\nbrane in a generic constant closed string background E t with no background gauge\nfield (F t = 0) on its worldvolume. By applying on it a general transformation of\nthe T-duality group, we get what we call the most general Narain brane having a\nnon-vanishing constant magnetic field F on its worldvolume.\nWe start with a plain D25 on R1 \u2297 T 25 whose boundary state satisfies the\nboundary conditions in Eq. (123) with F t = 0:\nh\ni\nj\nt j\nGtij (\u1e8a t ) + Bijt (X \u2032 )\n|D25(E t , F t = 0)i \u2261 Pit |D25(E t , F t = 0)i = 0 (69)\n\u03c4 =0\n\nThe solution of these equations is given in Eq.s (128) and (129) for d = 26.\nWe now perform a canonical transformation as in Eqs. (150), (151) such that\nD\u0302 \u22121 C\u02c6 is a well-defined quantity, then the boundary defining Eq. (69) becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX \u2032j\n\u22121 \u02c6\nPi + (D\u0302 C)ij\n|D25(E, F i = 0\n(70)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nthat is equal to Eq. (123) with the following gauge field:\nF\u0302 = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 q F = \u2212D\u0302 \u22121 C\u02c6 = C\u02c6T D\u0302 \u2212T .\n25\n\n(71)\n\n\fThe last equality follows from the entry (2, 2) of Eq. (162). Here q is the electric\ncharge.\nUnder this transformation the zero mode part of the boundary (129) becomes:\n|D25(E, F )izm = |D25(E t , F t = 0)izm\n\u221a\np\nX\ndet E\n|ni = (C\u02c6T )ij sj , mi = D\u0302 T ij sj i\ndet D\u0302\n=\n1/4\n(det G)\ns\u2208Z 25\n\u221a\np\nX\ndet E\n=\ndet D\u0302\n|ni = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032qFij mj , mi = D\u0302 T ij sj i\n1/4\n(det G)\ns\u2208Z 25\n\n(72)\n\nwhere in the first equality we have written the boundary state with a non-vanishing\ngauge field as the one in Eq. (129) with nti = 0 and mt i = si . By rewriting those\nvariables in terms of n and m given in the upper equation in (164) one gets the\nsecond line of Eq. (72) that can finally be written as in the third line by means of\nEq. (71). A detailed explanation of the normalization factor is given in Ref. [18]\nand reviewed in Appendix C. Finally, when det D\u0302 =\n6 0, the complete boundary\nstate (128) satisfying Eq.

We would like here to compare this with the\nboundary state corresponding to a Narain brane. To this aim, we consider the\nsimple case in which the compact space is a factorized torus. In particular, we can\n\u02c6\nfocus on a single T 2 , being the generalization to (T 2 )d/2 straightforward, and as a\nvery special example we consider the canonical transformation acting in the first\n2\ntorus T(1)\nalong the directions 1 and 2 realized by the matrix:\n\u039b2 (p(1) , q(1) ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nr(1) I\nis(1) \u03c32\n\u2212ip(1) \u03c32 q(1) I\n26\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(74)\n\n\fBy imposing the condition \u039b2 (p(1) , q(1) ) \u2208 O(2, 2, Z) (see Eq.

From Eq.s (151) and (74) we can see that:\n2\ndet D\u0302 = q(1)\n.\n\nThis T-duality transforms a plain D-brane into a configuration of a D-brane with\na gauge field strength given by (see Eq.

This realizes\nEq. (3) according to the second logical possibility discussed in the Introduction, not\ncoming the integer q(1) from any trace over the gauge group. The latter condition\nis the first hint that the Narain branes are branes wrapped q(1) times on the entire\ntorus.\nIn this case Eq.

Indeed the area of such an object, its Dirac-Born-Infeld action\n(DBI) and therefore the boundary state normalization should be proportional to q(1)\nbecause the brane covers q(1) times the compact manifold and this indeed happens\nin Eq. (75).\nThe boundary state in Eq. (75) coincides with the one given for the non-abelian\nbranes, see for example Eq. (58), with the identification q(1) = N1 . The only\ndifference between the two is in the phase factor written in Eq. (64). As already\nstressed in the Introduction, this factor does not influence the one-loop free energy.\nWe can consider the more general case in which the T-duality acts on each torus\n2\nT(\u03b1)\nas in Eq.

We still consider a non-magnetized space filling\nbrane, and on it we act with the special case of the standard T-duality, given by:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nIp\n0p\n\uf8ec\n0d\u2212p\nId\u2212p \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(76)\n\u039b=\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 0p\nIp\nId\u2212p\n0d\u2212p\nwith d = 25.

In particular when\n\u00c2 + B\u0302 F\u0302 = 0\nEq. (77) reduces to\n\u2032\n\nX t i |D1(E t )i = 0\ncorresponding to pure Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nWhen det(\u00c2 + B\u0302 F\u0302 ) 6= 0 we can then evaluate how E transforms:\nE t = E tT + F\u0302 t = (\u00c2 + B\u0302E)\u2212T (C\u02c6 + D\u0302E)T + (C\u02c6 + D\u0302F\u0302 )(\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 )\u22121\nwhere we have used Eq.s (165) and (77), together with Eq.s (162) and (163). One\ncan equivalently write:\nE t = = E tT + F\u0302 t = (\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 )\u2212T E(\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )\u22121 .\n29\n\n(79)\n\n\fFrom them we deduce\nGt\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0398t\n\n= (\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 )G \u22121 (\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 )T = T (F ) G \u22121 T T (F )\n(80)\nT\nT\nT\nT\n= (\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 )\u0398(\u00c2 + B\u0302 F\u0302 ) + B\u0302(\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 ) = T (F ) \u0398 T (F ) + B\u0302T (F )\n(81)\n\nwith G and \u0398 defined in appendix A. Here we have introduced the matrix\nT (F ) = (\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 ) = (D\u0302 \u2212 F t B\u0302)\u2212T = T t\n\n\u22121\n\n(F t )\n\n(82)\n\nand used the relation:\nT (F )B\u0302T + B\u0302T T (F ) = 0.\n\nNotice the important fact that \u0398 does not transform \"tensorially\" under a T-duality\nbut it behaves like a connection and has a shift term.\nThe inverses of the previous equations can be obtained using Eq. (160), i.e\n\u00c2 \u2194 D\u0302 T , B\u0302 \u2192 B\u0302T , C\u02c6 \u2192 C\u02c6T and exchanging t quantities with those without t . In\ncomparing this set of equations with the one we have written we find\n(\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T ) = (D\u0302 \u2212 E t B\u0302)\u2212T ,\n\n4.4\n\n(\u00c2 + B\u0302E) = (D\u0302 \u2212 E tT B\u0302)\u2212T\n\nAdding Wilson lines to the boundary state\n\nIn section 3.1 we have seen that a D-brane with F = 0 wrapped N-times around a\ntorus can be described as a brane with gauge group U(N) and a Wilson line background which induces a non trivial holonomy [8]. The boundary state description\nfor such a brane can therefore be obtained turning on Wilson lines to the boundary\nstate discussed in section 4.1 in the special case F t = 0. More explicitly we have to\ncompute:\nR\u03c0\n\nt\n\n\u2032t i\n\n|D25(E t , F t = 0, at )i = Tr P e\u2212iq 0 d\u03c3 ai X |D25(E t , F t = 0)i\nN\n\u221a\nX\nt b i\n\u2032\ne\u2212i2\u03c0 \u03b1 qai m\u0302 |D25(E t , F t = 0)i\n=\nb=1\n\n\u221a\nT25\ndet E t\n=\n|D25(E t, F t = 0)inzm\n1/4\nt\n2 (det G )\n\u00d7\n\nN X\nX\n\nb=1 s\u2208Z 25\n\ne\u2212i2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 qati b si\n\n|nti = 0, mt i = si i.\n\nLet us also explore the effect of a T-duality transformation on the Wilson line itself.\nBy performing a T-duality on the previous expression one is immediately led to:\n\u221a\ndet E\nT25 p\n|D25(E, F )inzm\ndet D\u0302\n|D25(E, F, a)i =\n2\n(det G)1/4\nN X\n\u221a\nX\nt b i\n\u2032\ne\u2212i2\u03c0 \u03b1 qai s |ni = C\u02c6T i j sj , mi = D\u0302 T i j sj i.\n\u00d7\nb=1 s\u2208Z 25\n\n30\n\n\fSince we expect the Wilson line to be multiplied by the winding mi = D\u0302 T i j sj we\ndeduce that\nati b D\u0302 \u2212T i j = abj \u21d2 at b T (F ) = ab\n(83)\n\nwhere we have used Eq. (82) for the special case F t = 0 and assumed that the\ntransformation must be dependent on F .\nIn order to extend the previous discussion to the case in which both a Wilson line\nbackground and an abelian background gauge field F (proportional to the unity)\nare turned on, one can follow the same\nprocedure since Ai (x) + ai can be added\nR\n\u2212iq 0\u03c0 d\u03c3 (Ai +ai )X \u2032t i\nor in two steps by computing\nto the Rboundary eitherR as tr P e\n\u2212iq 0\u03c0 d\u03c3 ai X \u2032t i \u2212iq 0\u03c0 d\u03c3 Ai X \u2032t i\n. By choosing the second procedure, one starts\ne\ntr e\nwith a boundary with F t = 0, then one constructs the one with F 6= 0 by means\nof a T-duality transformation with matrix \u039b0 and finally one adds Wilson lines. In\nthis way one gets:\nR\u03c0\n\n\u2032i\n\n|D25(E, F, a)i = tr P e\u2212iq 0 d\u03c3 ai X |D25(E, F )i\nN\n\u221a\nX\nb i\n\u2032\ne\u2212i2\u03c0 \u03b1 qai m\u0302 |D25(E, F )i\n=\nb=1\n\n\u221a\nq\ndet E0\n|D25(E, F )inzm\ndet D\u03020\n(det G)1/4\nN X\n\u221a\nX\nj\nb Ti\n\u2032\ne\u2212i2\u03c0 \u03b1 qai D\u03020 j s |ni = C\u02c60T i j sj , mi = D\u03020T i j sj i (84)\n\u00d7\n\nT25\n=\n2\n\nb=1 s\u2208Z 25\n\nwhere F\u0302 = C\u02c60T D\u03020\u2212T , |D25(E, F )inzm is the non zero mode part of the boundary, and\nm\u0302i is the winding operator.\nFinally one can study the transformation properties of the Wilson lines under\nT-duality in the case F 6= 0. Performing a second T-duality transformation with\nmatrix \u039b (see (150)) on the previous boundary, its zero mode part becomes (see\nEq.

In particular we have seen that, starting from a configuration without\ngauge fields on the branes, the T-duality transformation, performed by the matrix \u039b\ngiven in Eq. (151), provides a configuration with a non-zero gauge field given in Eq.\n(78). Moreover also the boundary state acquires the same gauge field (Eq. (73)). In\nthis way one can obtain a theory with a non-zero gauge field from a theory without\nit. Of course, if we transform not only the operators but all quantities appearing in\na string amplitude, as for instance the momenta of the external particles, nothing\nwill change because T-duality is a symmetry of string theory.\nIn this section we want to extend this procedure to the vertex operators. Since\nwe know that we are going to get a theory with a gauge field given by F\u0302 = C\u02c6T D\u0302 \u2212T ,\nwe can immediately write the vertex operators describing the emission of open string\ntachyons. They are given by:\nV(0) (x; k) = eiD0 (k,F\u0302 ,B;p\u0302) : ei(k0 XL (x)+ki XL(0) (x)) :\ni\n0\nV (y; k) = eiD\u03c0 (k,F\u0302 ,B;p\u0302) : ei(k0 XL (x)+ki XL(0) (y)) :\n0\n\n(\u03c0)\n\ni\n\n(85)\n\nwhere we assume that all the spatial directions are compactified. Here x = |x|,\ny = |y|ei\u03c0 . We consider only one of such branes and consequently we do not need to\nintroduce any Chan-Paton factor. The factors eiD0,\u03c0 (k,F\u0302 ,B;p\u0302) are the cocycles phase\nfactors [36] and are necessary to have a well-defined theory of open and closed\nstrings. They can be explicitly derived by requiring the theory to satisfy certain\nspecific constraints such as the commutativity among open and closed string vertices and a proper behavior of the vertices under Hermitian conjugation. Cocycles\nplay an important rule in determining whether the theory is commutative or not.\nHowever, their explicit knowledge is not crucial for discussing the main features\nof Narain branes and for comparing them with the non-abelian bundle description\nof magnetized branes. Therefore we postpone their explicit evaluation and the\ndiscussion about the commutation property of the theory to further developments.\nBefore going on, let us now spend a few words about how Eq. (85) can be\nderived. The vertex operator for an open string tachyon is obtained by inserting in\nthe exponent of the vertex operator the string coordinate in Eq. (18), computed at\none of the endpoints of the open string. But then, for instance in the case of \u03c3 = 0,\ni\none can use Eq.s (147) and express it in terms of X(0)L\n, apart from a phase that\ncontributes to the cocycle that we are anyway not considering as explained above.\nA similar reasoning can also be used for the other endpoint.\nLet us now consider the vertex for the closed string tachyon. If the vertex has\nto be used in an amplitude with only closed strings (sphere diagram), then, apart\n\n32\n\n\ffrom a cocycle factor, it is given by:\nWTc (z, z\u0304; kL , kR ) =: e(ik0 X\n\n0 (z,z\u0304)+k\n\ni\ni\nLi XL (z)+kRi X\u0303R (z\u0304))\n\n:\n\n(86)\n\nwhere XL and X\u0303R are given respectively in Eq.s (110) and (111) and the variables\nz and z\u0304 are defined in the entire complex plane.\nOn the other hand, the vertex for the closed string tachyon describing interactions on the disk diagram is given by [35\u201337]\nWTc (z, z\u0304; kL , kR , y0 ) = eiDC (k,F\u0302 ,B;p\u0302)\ni\nh\n0 (z)+k (G\u22121 E)i X j\n1\n0\n\u22121 T i\ni\ni 12 k0 XL\nLi\nj L(0) (z)\n:: ei[ 2 k0 XR (z\u0304)+kRi (G E ) j XR(0) (z\u0304)] :\n:e\n\n(87)\n\nHere z is defined in the upper half complex plane and the phase factor eiDC (k,F\u0302 ,B;p\u0302)\nare the closed string cocycles. After having determined the open and closed string\nvertex operators, one can then compute the scattering amplitudes involving them,\nbut, before doing that, let us first describe the action of T-duality on both the closed\nand open string vertex operators. This will allow us to rederive Eq.s (85) and, more\nimportantly, to study in which sense the Narain branes are wrapped branes.\nLet us start from the closed string vertex given in Eq. (86) and show that, under\na T-duality transformation, it keeps the same form. By considering of course only\nthe compact space part and extending the T-duality transformations in Eq.s (155)\nto be valid also for the coordinates XLi and X\u0303Ri , and not just for their derivatives,\nwe get:\nXLti = (A + BE)XLi ; XLti = (A \u2212 BE T )X\u0303Ri .\nOn the other hand, we have to remember that also the external momenta kL and\nj\nkR transform according to Eq.s (156) that, with Eq.s kL,R i = Gij kL,R\nand (166),\nimply the following transformations:\nt T\nkLiT = kLj\n(\u00c2 + B\u0302E)j i\n\nt T\nkRiT = kRj\n(\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )j i .\n\n(88)\n\nBy using the two previous equations, it is easy to see that the exponent in the\nvertex operator remains the same in form:\nt T\nt T\nT\nT\nkLi\nXLti + kRi\nX\u0303Rti = kLi\nXLi + kRi\nX\u0303Ri\n\nwhere the index T has been introduced here for the sake of clarity.\nLet us consider now the vertex for the closed string tachyon to be used on a\ndisk amplitude given in Eq. (87). From the transformation properties of the closed\nstring momenta given in Eq.s (88) one can deduce the transformations under Tduality of the left and right moving parts of the vertex operator by requiring that\nthe closed string vertices, written in open string formalism, are invariant in form\nunder such a transformation. In this way we get:\nGt\nGt\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nt\nE t XL(0)\n(z) = (\u00c2 + B\u0302E)G\u22121 EXL(0) (z),\n\nt\nE t T XR(0)\n(z\u0304) = (\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )G\u22121 E T XR(0) (z\u0304)\n\n33\n\n(89)\n\n\ffor the left and right components of X.\nBut we have to take into account that in the open string formalism the left and\nright parts are not independent because of the reflection conditions. They can be\nof two types either Neumann or Dirichlet.\nOne can therefore distinguish two cases:\n1. The reflection conditions are generalized Neumann boundary conditions7 in\nboth the original theory and in the T-dual one. This implies the two equations:\nt\nt\nXL(0)\n(x) = XR(0)\n(x) ; XL(0) (x) = XR(0) (x).\n\n(90)\n\nt\nt\nThus, after imposing XL(0)\n(x) = XR(0)\n(x) and using XL(0) (x) = XR(0) (x) in\nEq. (89), one gets:\n\u0001\u22121\n\u0001\u22121\nGt \u22121 E t\n(\u00c2 + B\u0302E)G\u22121 E = Gt \u22121 E t T\n(\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )G\u22121 E T\n\n= \u00c2 + B\u0302F = T (F ).\n\nThe third identity can be verified by using Eq.s (166) and (79). From Eq.s\n(89) we find:\nt\nXL(0)\n(z) = T (F ) XL(0) (z)\n\nt\nXR(0)\n(z\u0304) = T (F ) XR(0) (z\u0304)\n\n(91)\n\nwhich can be simply interpreted as due to the fact that in the T-dual system\ndistances are rescaled by T (F ). Thus the boundary conditions in Eq. (90)\ncan both be imposed when\ndet T (F ) = det(\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 ) 6= 0.\nAfter having examined the closed string vertices, we can now discuss what\nhappens to the open string vertices in Eq.s (85). If we require them to remain\ninvariant in form, the following equation has to be imposed:\neik\n\nt T Xt\n(x)\nL(0)\n\n= eik\n\nt T T (F )\n\nXL(0) (x)\n\n= eik\n\nTX\n\nL(0) (x)\n\nwhere we have used Eq. (91) and\nk T = k t T T (F ).\n\n(92)\n\nThis is the vertex that we have already written down in Eq. (85). The\ntransformations in Eq. (91) are obviously consistent with the OPEs in Eq.\n(148) when\nG t = T \u2212T (F )GT \u22121(F )\nwhich matches perfectly the first equation in (80).\n7\n\nWe call these b.c. generalized Neumann because they are Neumann b.c. on the X(0) fields\nbut not on X ones; this in the spirit of the asymmetric rotation of [12].\n\n34\n\n\f2. The reflection conditions are generalized Neumann boundary conditions in\nthe original theory and mixed generalized Neumann and Dirichlet boundary\nconditions in the T-dual one. This is the case when\ndet T (F ) = det(\u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 ) = 0.\nThis condition is very general and corresponds to various different generalized\nNeumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions according to the number of zero\neigenvalues of the matrix T . For our discussion we consider a special subcase\ncharacterized by the following condition:\nT = \u00c2 + B\u0302F\u0302 = 0 \u21d2 F\u0302 t = \u221e.\nThis special case corresponds to the Dirichlet reflection conditions in all the\ncompact X t coordinates:\nt\nt\nXL(0)\n(x) = \u2212XR(0)\n(x) ; XL(0) (x) = XR(0) (x).\n\n(93)\n\nHowever in this case the T-dual coordinate does not have anymore the expansion in Eq.s (145) and (146), but one simply has (up to cocycles)\nt\nt\nX\u0302Lt (z) = XL(0)\n(z) ; X\u0302Rt (z\u0304) = XR(0)\n(z\u0304).\n\nComparing the vertices in the two T-dual theories as in Eq. (92) yields:\nt\nXL(0)\n(x) = (\u00c2 + B\u0302E)G\u22121 EXL(0) (x);\n\nt\nXR(0)\n(x) = (\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )G\u22121 E T XR(0) (x).\n\nHence, the boundary conditions in Eq. (93) are consistent if the following\nequation holds:\n(\u00c2 + B\u0302E)G\u22121 E = \u2212(\u00c2 \u2212 B\u0302E T )G\u22121 E T = B\u0302G.\nThis can be verified with the help of F\u0302 = \u2212B\u0302\u22121 \u00c2. Therefore we get a relation\nbetween the \"momentum\" (actually distance) in Dirichlet directions k t and\nthe momentum k, given by:\nk T = k tT B\u0302G.\nMoreover, in both cases, by using Eq.s (155) and (166), we have\nT (z) = \u2212\n\n1\n1\nT\n\u2202X\n(z)G\u2202X\n(z)\n=\n\u2212\n\u2202XLtT (z)Gt \u2202XLt (z)\nL\nL\n\u03b1\u2032\n\u03b1\u2032\n\nand, because of this, all conformal dimensions are preserved.\nWe are now ready to compute the scattering amplitudes involving open and\nclosed strings in the case of non-abelian and Narain branes, and compare them. As\n35\n\n\fwe will see below, the amplitudes exhibiting a difference between the non-abelian\nand Narain branes are the ones involving both open and closed strings. In particular,\nit is sufficient to limit ourselves to external tachyons. We only consider the compact\npart of correlators involving one closed string tachyon and M open string tachyons,\nup to phases that we have systematically neglected in this paper. In the case of\nnon abelian branes one gets\nh0|W (z, z\u0304; kL , kR )V (x1 ; k1) . . . V (xM ; kM )|0icompact\n#\n\"M\nY\n= Tr\n\u039b(k(i) ,k(i) ) A(z, z\u0304, xr , ki )\u03b4E T G\u22121 kL +EG\u22121 kR +PM\n1\n\ni=1\n\nr=1\n\n2\n\n(94)\n\nkr ,0\n\nwhile for the Narain branes one gets\nh0|W (z, z\u0304; kL , kR )V (x1 ; k1 ) . . . V (xM ; kM )|0icompact\n= A(z, z\u0304, xr , ki )\u03b4E T G\u22121 kL +EG\u22121 kR +PM kr ,0\nr=1\n\nwhere\n\nA(z, z\u0304, xr , ki ) \u2261\n\u00d7\n\nM\nY\n\n\u2032 T\n\n(z \u2212 xr )2\u03b1 kL G\n\nr=1\nM\nY\n\n\u22121 EG \u22121 k\n\n\u2032 T\n\n1=r<s\n\n(xr \u2212 xs )2\u03b1 kr G\n\n\u22121 k\n\ns\n\nr\n\n\u2032 T\n\n(z\u0304 \u2212 xr )2\u03b1 kR G\n\u2032 T\n\n(z \u2212 z\u0304)2\u03b1 kL E\n\n\u22121 E T G \u22121 k\n\n\u2212T EG\u22121 k\n\nR\n\n.\n\nr\n\n(95)\n\nEqs. (94) and (95) are easily seen to differ only for the trace over the Chan Paton\nfactors which is given in Eq. (68). This is the consequence of the fact that the\nvertex operators for closed string tachyons is the one given in Eq. (86) for both\ntheories, while the ones for open string tachyons have the same operatorial part as\nthose in Eq. (85), but those in the non-abelian branes have in addition momentum\ndependent Chan-Paton factors, given in Eq. (67).\nBy using the formulas in the Appendices it is easy to show that the \u03b4-function\nwhich is common to the two correlators gives:\nj\n\nni \u2212 F\u0302ij m +\n\nM\nX\nnr\ni\n\nr=1\n\nN\n\n= 0 ; i = 1, 2\n\nin terms of rthe momentum ni and winding number mi of the closed string and the\nn\nmomenta Ni of the open strings. For the sake of simplicity we have restricted our\nanalysis to the two direction of a torus T 2 . Using Eq. (2) in the previous equation\none gets:\nM\n\nn1 \u2212\n\nM\n\nmm2 X nr1\nmm1 X nr2\n+\n= n2 +\n+\n=0\nN\nN\nN\nN\nr=1\nr=1\n36\n\n(96)\n\n\fThey can be satisfied only if the following relations holds\nM\nX\nr=1\n\nnr1\n\n2\n\n\u2212 mm = s1 N ;\n\nM\nX\n\nnr2 + mm1 = s2 N\n\n(97)\n\nr=1\n\nwhere s1 and s2 are arbitrary integers. Finally inserting them back in Eq. (96) one\ngets:\nn1 + s1 = n2 + s2 = 0\n\n(98)\n\nThe constraint imposed by the \u03b4-function can be satisfied only if Eq.s (97) and (98)\nare satisfied\nIn the case of non-abelian branes the trace over the Chan Paton factors imposes\nthe following additional constraints:\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 N\n\nM\nX\nr=1\n\nr\nk1,2\n\n=\n\nM\nX\n\nnr1,2 = r1,2 N\n\nr=1\n\nwhere r1,2 are integer numbers.\nIn conclusion, for non-abelian branes the relations in Eq. (99) must be considered together with Eq.s (97) and (98). Therefore the class of solutions that one gets\nfor the Narain branes is bigger than the one for the non-abelian branes and this\nmeans that the two theories are not equivalent. Notice, however, that a difference\ncan be noticed only if the scattering amplitude involves at least one closed string.\nIf we had only open strings then one would get precisely the same conditions for\nthe two cases. The same is true for the case of a closed string with ni = mi = 0.\nIn the previous section we have shown that the non-abelian branes provide a\ndescription of branes wrapped N times on the torus T 2 through the introduction of\na non-abelian gauge bundle based on the gauge group U(N). In other words, the\nwrapping number N is provided by the order of the gauge group. This is the reason\nwhy for this kind of branes we must introduce Chan-Paton factors that turned\nout to be momentum dependent. In the case of the Narain brane we do not have\nany non-abelian gauge field. Then in what sense do the Narain branes provide a\ndescription of wrapped branes? Or can we say that the Narain branes provide an\nalternative description of them? And if yes, what is the precise meaning to give to\nthis claim?\nIn the introduction we have discussed two possibilities for obtaining Eq. (2).\nThe first one is based on the presence of a non-abelian gauge bundle and this is\nthe one realized by the non-abelian branes. In the following, we aim to show that\nthe Narain branes seem to realize the other possibility discussed around Eq. (3).\nIn order to see how this comes about, we have to study what happens to the open\nstring coordinate when we go around the torus. This is what we are going to discuss\nin the last part of this subsection.\n37\n\n\fWe start rewriting the tachyon open string vertex operator in Eq. (85) for a\nNarain brane which is obtained through a T-duality from a plain brane with F t = 0,\nas follows:\nj\nik t (D\u0302 \u2212T )i j XL(0)\n(x)\nV(0)T,c (x; k) \u223c: e i\n:\n\u221a\nwhere we used T (F ) = D\u0302 \u2212T (because of Eq. (82)). The fact that \u03b1\u2032 kit \u2208 Z\nimmediately implies that the theory is invariant under\n\u221a\nX \u2192 X + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 D\u0302 T s \u2200s \u2208 Z 25\nwhile in the original theory the vertex operator was only invariant under\n\u221a\nX t \u2192 X t + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 s.\nThe periodicity of the open string coordinate can also be verified directly starting\nfrom the operator which performs a shift of X t \u2192 X t + 2\u03c0s and rewriting it in the\nT-dual theory\nTst = e2\u03c0i\n\nsT G t p t\n\n= e2\u03c0i\n\nsT G t T (F )p\n\n= e2\u03c0i\n\nsT T \u2212T (F )Gp\n\n= e2\u03c0i\n\n(D\u0302 T s)T Gp\n\n= TD\u0302T s .\n\nIn order to see more explicitly what happens it is convenient to specialize the\nprevious discussion to the first case treated in Section 4.2. There, T-duality acts\n2\non each torus T(t)\nas in Eq. (74) with parameters (p(t) , q(t) ). It is straightforward\nto write the compact part of the tachyonic vertex, in fact, by focusing only on the\nfirst torus:\n1\n2\ni\n\n(x)+n2 X\n(x)\nn1 X\nL(0)\nL(0)\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 q(1)\n\nV(0)T,c (x; k) \u223c: e\n:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\nwhere the compact momentum is \u03b1\u2032 k = qn(1)1 , qn(1)2 with all n integers.\nUnlike the open string vertices in the case of non-abelian branes, these vertices\nhave no Chan-Paton factors and describe objects with non-trivial wrapping\n\u221a\nX 1,2 = X 1,2 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 q(1) s.\nAs discussed in section 4.2, the normalization factor in front of the boundary\nstate in Eq. (75) suggests that a Narain brane is a brane wrapped q times around\nthe whole torus. This means that the previous periodicity conditions have to be\ninterpreted as simultaneous conditions on X 1 and X 2 (in the case of T 2 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(X 1 , X 2 ) = (X 1 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 q(1) s, X 2 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 q(1) s)\nwhile\n\u221a\n(X 1 , X 2 ) 6= (X 1 , X 2 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 q(1) s)\n\n\u221a\n(X 1 , X 2 ) 6= (X 1 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 q(1) s, X 2 )\n\nThis is consistent with the fact that, with the special choice of the T-duality transformation given in Eq. (74), the matrix D\u0302 is purely diagonal with two identical\nentries.\n38\n\n\fIn conclusion, the theory based on the Narain branes seems to provide a description of branes wrapped on the two-cycle of the torus, that is different, rather\nthan alternative, from that provided by the non-abelian branes. A further study of\nthese two different formulations of wrapped branes is needed to better clarify their\nphysical properties and what kind of wrapped branes they really describe.\n\nA\n\nConventions\n\u2022 Indices:\n\u02c6\nNon-compact \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, . . . 25 \u2212 d;\n\u02c6\nCompact i, j, * * * = 1, . . . d;\n[N ]\n\n\u2022 \u03b4m,n means m \u2261 n mod N;\n\u2022 't Hooft matrices\n\uf8eb\n0 1\n\uf8ec .. . .\n\uf8ec\n.\nPN = \uf8ec .\n\uf8ed 0\n1 0\n\nPN and QN :\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n... 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\u03c0i(1\u2212N)\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8f7 ; QN = e N \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n... 1 \uf8f8\n... 0\n\n1\n...\n2i\u03c0\nN\n0 e ...\n..\n..\n.\n.\n0\n\n...\n\nsatisfying the commutation relation:\n\nPN QN = QN PN e2\u03c0 i/N .\n\n0\n..\n.\ne2i\u03c0\n\n(N\u22121)\nN\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n(99)\n\n\u2022 Background matrices:\nE = k Eij k= G + B\nE = k Eij k= E T + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032q0 F = G \u2212 B\nand\nF\u0302 = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 q0 F\nB = B \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 q0 F = B \u2212 F\u0302\nE \u22121 = G \u22121 \u2212 \u0398\nfrom which we deduce that\nEG \u22121 E T = E T G \u22121 E = G\n\u0001\n1 \u2212T\n\u0398=\nE \u2212 E \u22121 = \u2212E \u22121 BE \u2212T\n2\n39\n\n(100)\n\n\fB\n\nReview of open and closed strings in flux background\n\nIn this Appendix we review the solution of closed string equations of motion in\nconstant backgrounds on a torus in order to fix our notations and give some technical\ndetails about the open string solution as well.\n\nB.1\n\nAction and equations of motion\n\nLet us consider the action for the spatial coordinates, labelled by the indices a, b =\n1, . . . , d \u2212 1, of a bosonic string 8 interacting with a constant gravitational and a\nKalb-Ramond background that is given by Eq.

The\ngeneralization of such calculation to a generic torus T 6 will be trivial. In order to\nsimplify the calculation, we take the background gauge field in the gauge:\nA1 = 0\n\nA2 = \u2212F12 x1\n\ni\nwhich is different from the gauge choice made in\n\u221a x are\n\u221a the Sec. 2. iHere, the\nthe compact coordinates bounded between 0, 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 , i.e. 0 \u2264 x < 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 , with\ni = 1, 2.\nThe boundary state in the presence of a magnetic field is related to the uncharged\none by the relation [33]:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nH\n|D25(E, F )i = T r P e\u2212i qA |D25(E, F = 0)i\n(169)\n\nDenoting by \u03b3 the closed path of the integration, we parameterized it as follows:\n\u03b3 : \u03c3 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] \u2212\u2192 (X 1 (\u03c3), X 2 (\u03c3))\n\nThe path, in general, will wrap w i times the torus and the details of such a wrapping\nare important in the evaluation of the path-ordering appearing in the Eq.(169). This\nis because every time that the curve makes a turn around the cycles of the torus, the\ngauge transition functions must be introduced \"to glue\" the fields at the boundaries\nof the torus. Such a gluing can be realized as follows. We first choose the origin\nof the compact frame coincident with the first end of the curve and label with \u03bbi ,\n(\u03bb0 = 0 and \u03bbM +1 = \u03c0) the values\n\u221a which the parameter \u03c3 takes when the path cross\ni\nthe boundary values x = 0, 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 , i = 1, 2. We can write then:\n51\n\n\fi\n\ni\n\nX (\u03c3) = x (\u03c3) + 2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\np\nX\n\nsik ;\n\n\u03c3 \u2208 [\u03bbp , \u03bbp+1 ]\n\nk=1\n\n\u221a\nHere 0 \u2264 xi (\u03c3) < 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 and sip = \u22121, 1 respectively if the path in the corresponding\ninterval [\u03bbp\u22121 , \u03bbp ] \"unwraps\" or wraps once, while is zero if the curve is constant in\nthe interval. The total wrapping will be given by:\ni\n\nw =\n\nM\nX\n\nsik\n\nk=1\n\nNow, we are ready to explicitly compute the path-ordering introduced in Eq. (169)\nin the case of non-abelian branes.
